613221,Every woset is an ordinal.,"I use this notation: a well ordered set $Y$ is an ordinal if for every $a\in Y$, $Y_a=a$, where $Y_a=\{y\in Y|y< a\}$.
Now, I know that for every woset there is an isomorphism from that woset to a (unique) ordinal. So let $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ be an iso, with $X$ a well-ordered set and $Y$ an ordinal. I claim that $X$ is an ordinal. Here is my proof: for every $a\in X$ we have $$X_a=X_{f^{-1}(b)}=f^{-1}(Y_b)=f^{-1}(b)=a$$ Since I know that this is not the case, can you tell me where is the error in my proof?","['ordinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Let me start with simple example - line bundle $\mathcal{O}(3x)$ over $E$, then $H^0(E, \mathcal{O}(3x))$ is a $3$-dimensional space, and basis is $1, \sigma, \sigma'$, where $\sigma$ is a Weierstrass function. My first question is there any description of this kind for sections of arbitrary line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ of degree, say, $3$? Second question. Let me choose a vector bundle of rank two, say as kernel of some map, or some extension of a line bundle by a line bundle. Is there a way to understand its sections as $2$-component vector functions, with special properties, known as some interesting analytic functions? I want to understand the following example. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a line bundle of degree $3$ and $\mathcal{L} \ncong \mathcal{O}(3x)$, vector bundle $K$ of rank $2$ is defined by short exact sequence

613462,Introduction to sheaves using categorical approach,"When I first started to learn about sheaves, it was a very geometric approach. This is nice, but it seems like knowing more abstract categorical approach is very useful. For example, sheafification $(\mathcal{F})^+$ of a presheaf $\mathcal{F}$ became much more clear to me when I realized that it can be defined as the left adjoint functor $(-)^+\colon \mathsf{PSh}(X)\to \mathsf{Sh}(X)$ to the forgetful functor $i\colon \mathsf{Sh}(X)\to \mathsf{PSh}(X)$, where $i$ views any sheaf as a presheaf. Here $X$ is a topological space, and $\mathsf{Sh}(X)$ and $\mathsf{PSh}(X)$ are categories of sheaves and presheaves on $X$ respectively. So my question is: do you know any nice introduction to sheaves that would not be too crazy abstract, but which will use categorical definitions, constructions and proofs (where possible)?

613484,Length of a Continuous Curve,"Let f be a bounded real valued function on [a,b], then define the length of the curve L(f) as follows:

L(f)=sup\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{ (x_i-x_{i-1})^2+(f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1}))^2},

where sup is taken over all partitions of [a,b]. The question is to show, L(f) is equal to

\lim\limits_{max|x_i-x_{i-1}|\to 0}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt {(x_i-x_{i-1})^2+(f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1}))^2}

I know when $max|x_i-x_{i-1}|\to 0$, we get finer partitions so that $(1)\leq(2)$ because if we pick any partition and then let $max|x_i-x_{i-1}|\to0$ then we get a greater sum due to triangle inequality.(I guess what I said is true and does not require continuity.)
I could not show  $(2)\leq(1)$ and could not use the continuity. In a finite sum, we can switch $\sum$ and limit but as $max|x_i-x_{i-1}|\to0$ we get an infinite sum so switching may fail. I got stuck. P.S. I have read ( Determining the Length of a Curve Using Partitions ) but I did not understand ""there is a sequence $(Q_n)_{n\geq0}$ of partitions with (3) holds"" which was stated in the answer.

Obviously, there is a $\Gamma_0:[0,1]\to \mathbb{R}^2$ with $|\Gamma_0|=C(S)$, so if this last question is answered affirmatively, then we have found the minimum length curve. Simplified Question: If $S$ has finitely many extreme points, it's a convex polygon.

613543,Average complexity of random-pick comparison sort,"Motivation. Suppose we have a number of images that we want to arrange in a linear order from the prettiest to the ugliest. At our disposal we have a trained aesthete, whom we can show two pictures and ask him which is the prettiest. We assume that the aesthete's preferences are unchanging and internally consistent. (That's a pretty big assumption, but this is mathematics: Our assumptions don't have to be likely, only consistent). Our task is to discover the true aesthetic order between the images without paying the aesthete for too much work. Ideally we would use a good close-to-minimal comparison sorting algorithm, such as binary insertion sort which comes within $n$ of the information-theoretic bound of $\log_2 n!$ comparisons. Unfortunately most of the algorithms at hand tend to ask the aesthete runs of questions where he's asked to compare the same image to several other images in succession, and he finds that so boring that he threatens to increase his rates. While we're trying to find a better algorithm, the junior member of the design team suggests just to ask random questions until we know enough (but avoiding questions that we can deduce the answer to already). Is this a good idea? Actual question . Given $n$ , let $R_0$ be the identity relation on $\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$ .

But my textbook uses the explicit formula of the hemisphere $z=f(x,y)$ which yields $\hat n = <\frac{x}{z}, \frac{y}{z}, 1>$. Why is there a discrepancy between these two equations, and (in the case of the 2nd equation) how does it make sense physically for the z-component of the normal to always be 1? Also why is it that the normal coming from the explicit equation is undefined for $z=0$ when it shouldn't be?

613650,"Writing $(a,b)$ as a disjoint union of closed intervals [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Is $[0,1]$ a countable disjoint union of closed sets? (9 answers) Closed 10 years ago . I've been thinking about the following question: Is it possible to write $(a,b)$ as a disjoint union of closed intervals? My first guess was no, but then I figured the question might be hiding something subtle. I tried various things, some which I asked about on this site, and I can't seem to construct such a union. So I decided to go back to my gut feeling and prove that it cannot be done. Attempt: Suppose there is such a union. Then each closed interval contains a rational. Given that the sets are disjoint, any rational specifies a unique interval. Therefore the union must be a countable union, and we can list the closed intervals. Choose some listing $I_1,I_2,\dotsc$ and let: $$(a,b)=\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} I_k.$$ Now define $$J_n=(a,b)\setminus \bigcup_{k=1}^n I_k.$$ Specifically, consider that $J_2$ contains a middle interval $(a',b')$ where $a<a'<b'<b$ . Construct a sequence where each $u_n$ is arbitrarily chosen in $J_n \displaystyle\bigcap\, (a',b')$ . By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, $u_n$ contains a subsequence $v_n$ such that $v_n\to c$ . We must have $c \in (a,b)$ so $J_{\infty}\neq \varnothing$ which is a contradiction. Put differently, no matter how the closed intervals are chosen, we can find a sequence in $(a,b)$ that converges to a limit in $(a,b)$ which is contained in none of the closed intervals.

613654,"Prove that $f:(a, b) \to \mathbb R$ has at most countably many simple discontinuities","This is problem 17 in baby Rudin's chapter on continuity. He has a hint to use triplets of rationals that bound each simple discontinuity on the left, right, and in between the values of the limits from the left and right. It seems like this can be weakened to just rationals to the left and right. Simple discontinuities are those in which the limit from the left and right exist, so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist. More precisely, let $c$ and $c'$ be simple discontinuities for $f$ on $(a,b)$ and consider the limit, $l$, of $f$ approaching $c$ from the left: $$\forall \epsilon >0, \exists \delta>0 : c-x<\delta \Rightarrow |l-f(x)|<\epsilon$$ but $ \exists \epsilon '>0 \forall \delta ' >0 : |c'-x|<\delta ' \Rightarrow |f(c')-f(x)|>\epsilon '
\\ \therefore \epsilon = \epsilon ' , \delta ' = \delta \rightarrow \leftarrow
$ Therefore, you can make an injection from the set of simple discontinuities to a subset of rationals by associating each simple discontinuity with one rational in the aforementioned ""free"" interval to its left; from there compose with the map from rationals to integers to show countable.

 $$ \Pr\Big[\exists i ~\text{ s.t. }~ \big|S_i - E[S_i]\big| > k\Big] \leq f(k) ? $$ The naive approach would be to separately use a Chernoff bound on each $S_i$, then union bound over all $n$ events. At its worst/roughest, this gives

You might improve this a little with tweaking, but my intuition is that intuitively, this approach is too conservative because, for instance, given that $|S_n - E[S_n]| \leq k$, it seems very likely that all intermediate $S_i$ are within $k$ of their mean as well. (Notice that we are not being very demanding: we don't require them to all be multiplicatively close to their means, and we don't require the averages $\frac{S_i}{i}$ to all be within some value of their expectation; those situations seem harder than what we want here!)

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there does exist a surjection $f\colon A \to \mathscr P(A)$. Notice that for any element $a\in A$, we have $f(x)\in\mathscr P(A)$, so $f(a)$ is a subset of $A$. Thus $f$ is a function that sends elements of $A$ to subsets of $A$. ${\Large{\color{red}{\blacklozenge}}} \;$ It follows that for any $a\in A, \begin{cases} a \in \quad f(a) \in \mathscr P(A) \\ a \notin \quad f(a) \in \mathscr P(A) \end{cases}.$ Using this idea, define the following subset $B$ of $A$: $B=\{a\in A:a\notin f(a)\}\subseteq A$. Now since $B\subseteq A$ we have $B\in\mathscr P(A)$, and since $f$ is surjective there is an $a\in A$ for which $f(a)=B$. Now, either $a\in B$ or $a\notin B$. We will consider these two cases separately, and show that each leads to a contradiction. Source: (The inestimable, monumental, august) Book of Proof by Professor Richard Hammack.

$$ B := \left\{ \sum_{\text{finite}} a_i m_i \ | \ a \in I,\ m \in M \right\} $$ Clearly $A \subset B$, and if $I$ is a principal ideal then $B \subset A$ too.
I came up with the following counterexample to $B \subset A$ for when $I$ is not principal: Let $R = k[x_1, x_2, \dotsc]$ be the polynomial ring in infinitely many variables, $M$ be the $R$-submodule of $R$ consisting of those polynomials with zero constant term (and $0$), and $I = (x_1,x_2) \subset R$. Then $p = x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_4 \in B$, but it is not in $A$. (For if there are $f \in I, g \in M$ such that $fg = p$, then $\deg f = \deg g = 1$ and we can check that there are in fact no such $f$ and $g$.) Here I haven't actually used the non-Noetherianness of $k[x_1,x_2,\dotsc]$; $R = k[x_1, \dotsc, x_4]$ would have done just as nicely.
This counterexample also generalizes to $R = k[x_1, \dotsc, x_{2n}],\ I = (x_1,\dotsc,x_n)$.
But it's all pretty ad-hoc to me at the moment, are there any simpler/more general counterexamples ?

Note that in the automorphism case that a trivial central automorphism group forces v and w to be inverses. The problem, in proving the second from the first,  seems to be showing, for $$f(h) = v(w(h))h^{-1},$$ that $f(H) \subseteq C_H(v(G))$.

614238,Integers $n$ such that $i(i+1)(i+2) \cdots (i+n)$ is real or pure imaginary,"A couple of days ago I happened to come across [1], where the curious fact that $i(i-1)(i-2)(i-3)=-10$ appears ($i$ is the imaginary unit). This led me to the following question: Problem 1: Is $3$ the only positive integer value of $n$ such that $i(i-1)(i-2) \cdots (i-n)$ is a real number or a pure imaginary number? If not, can we describe all such integer values of $n$? Initial Analysis: We can view $i(i-1)(i-2) \cdots (i-n)$ as the result of applying a finite sequence of operations to $i,$ each of which involves a radial stretch from the origin and a rotation about the origin. Specifically, $i$ is moved radially outward by a factor of $\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} \cdots \sqrt{1^2 + n^2}$ and rotated counterclockwise by the angle $\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \cdots + \arctan n.$ Since we don't care about the magnitude of the result, only whether we land on the real axis or the imaginary axis, Problem 1 reduces to asking whether $3$ is the only positive integer value of $n$ such that $\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \cdots \arctan n$ is an integer multiple of $\frac{\pi}{4}.$ One can also check that $i(i+1)(i+2)(i+3) = -10.$ This is not a coincidence. Since $\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \arctan 3$ is an integer multiple of $\frac{\pi}{4},$ it follows that $\arctan (-1) + \arctan (-2) + \arctan (-3) = -\left(\arctan 1 + \arctan 2 + \arctan 3 \right)$ must also be an integer multiple of $\frac{\pi}{4}.$ Other than the products $(i-3)(i-2)(i-1)(i)$ and $(i)(i+1)(i+2)(i+3)$ (and two other products obtained by omitting the $i$ factor from these two), and products of the form $(i-k)(i-k+1) \cdots (i+k-1)(i+k)$ where $k$ can be any positive integer, I don't know any product of the form $(i+m)(i+m+1) \cdots (i+n)$ for integers $m$ and $n$ with $m < n$ that equals a real number or a pure imaginary number. Problem 2: Are $(i-3)(i-2)(i-1)(i)$ and $(i)(i+1)(i+2)(i+3)$ (and two other products obtained by omitting the the $i$ factor from these two), and products of the form $(i-k)(i-k+1) \cdots (i+k-1)(i+k)$ where $k$ can be any positive integer, the only pairs of integers $(m,n)$ with $m < n$ such that $(i+m)(i+m+1) \cdots (i+n)$ is a real number or a pure imaginary number? If not, can we describe all such pairs of integers $(m,n)$? Of course, it is easy to come up problems having a broader scope, such as replacing ""$i+m$"" with an arbitrary complex number whose real and imaginary parts are integers and/or using factors that increment the imaginary part by $1$ (or increment both the real and imaginary parts by $1$) and/or using factors that increment the real part (or the imaginary part, or both the real part and the imaginary part) by a constant integer amount, etc. I suspect the answers to these problems can be obtained from a careful analysis of Carl Størmer's 1890s results involving Machin-like formulas , but my knowledge of French and of this field of mathematics is rather poor. For those interested, I suggest looking at Størmer [2]. I also suspect there is a more direct way to solve Problem 1, and perhaps also Problem 2. Personally, I am only moderately interested in this issue, but I am posting it because I thought others in this group might find this something interesting to pursue. In particular, if there is not a fairly trivial way to solve Problem 1 and someone manages to find a solution that isn't extremely difficult, I suspect that such a solution would make for an interesting Math-Monthly type paper.

I'm impressed with the variety of mathematical techniques brought up in the comments and solutions, especially the probabilistic analysis that Hagen von Eitzen gave. I'm choosing KenWSmith's answer because, more than anyone else, he is responsible for bringing to light a solution (to Problem 1): We observe that all products of the form $i(i+1)(i+2) \cdots (i+n)$ have the form $a+bi$ where both $a$ and $b$ are integers. Thus, if $a+bi$ is real or pure imaginary, we have $a=0$ or $b=0,$ and hence the modulus of $a+bi$ equals $b$ or $a,$ and hence the modulus of $a+bi$ will be an integer. On the other hand, the modulus of $a+bi$ also equals $\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} \cdots \sqrt{1^2 + n^2}.$ Thus, Problem 1 is equivalent to finding all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} \cdots \sqrt{1^2 + n^2}$ is an integer. Equivalently, find all positive integer values of $n$ such that $(1^2 + 1^2)(1^2 + 2^2) \cdots (1^2 + n^2)$ is the square of an integer.

There's a normalizer for every element of the group (I've put only 3 for convenience). diagram shows that the center is contained in every normalizer .
Additionally, If i would to draw the normalizers of all the elements in $G$ their intersection would be precisely $Z(G)$ (is that right?). For the second diagram imagine we pick one of the elements of $G$, say x, and look at the partition of $G$ to cosets of $N(x)$. I've chosen for convenience that the index of $N(x)$ will be $5$.

No two unique conjugates can be in the same coset and The fact that no element of the center is a conjugate of any other element (apart from itself) can be seen as a consequence of the center being contained in all the normalizers (or maybe more obvious than that is the fact that the normalizer of each of them is the whole group) Is there a mistake in anything I’ve written?","['intuition', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

\forall \varepsilon >0 \,\,\,\,\exists n_\varepsilon : \forall n\geq n_\varepsilon \,\,\,\,\,|x_n-x_0|<\varepsilon
$$
So for a certain $\varepsilon$:
$$
|f(x_n)-f(x_0)|<\varepsilon_1
$$
If I call $\varepsilon=\delta$ and $\varepsilon_1=\varepsilon$ we have the definition of continuity. I'm not really sure, I don't know why. But can this proof be considered acceptable? I mean, it is correct and it is written in a decent way?","['metric-spaces', 'real-analysis']"
614343,How does one approximate $P(\sqrt{X_1} + \sqrt{X_2} + ... + \sqrt{X_n} \leq x)$?,"Given Problem Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ be independent, normally distributed random variables having mean $0$ and variance $\sigma^2$.  How should $P(\sqrt{X_1} + \sqrt{X_2} + ... + \sqrt{X_n} \leq x)$ be approximated in terms of $\Phi$? Thoughts for the Problem From the moment generating function, we see that if $X$ is a random variable of the normal distribution, then $$E[X^p] = \left\{
\begin{array}{c c}
0 & \text{if $p$ is odd}\\
\sigma^p (p - 1)!! & \text{if $p$ is even}
\end{array}
\right.
$$ For each $p$ (given the mean $0$ and variance $\sigma^2$), we have $$p = 1 \rightarrow 0$$
$$p = 2 \rightarrow \sigma^2$$
$$p = 3 \rightarrow 0$$
$$p = 4 \rightarrow 3\sigma^4$$
$$p = 5 \rightarrow 0$$ ...and so on.  These central moments are found by the following formulas $$M_X(t) = e^{\mu t + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 t^2}$$ where $\mu = 0$, and $$M_X^{(n)}(0) = E[X^n]$$ which is used to determine the mean of $X^n$. Let's suppose we want to determine the mean and variance of the random variable $X_i^{\frac{1}{2}}$ for each $i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n$.  Then, $$E\left[X^{\frac{1}{2}} \right] = M_X^{\left(\frac{1}{2} \right)}(0)$$ and $$Var\left[X^{\frac{1}{2}} \right] = E[X] - \left(E\left[X^{\frac{1}{2}} \right] \right)^2$$ Here is the part, where I am stuck.  How does one compute fractional derivative of the moment generating function at $t = 0$?  Is there a simple way to work this out?  Also, would doing the approximation acquires the same steps as approximating the sum of variables with integer exponents? I have a lot of thoughts about this problem.  My professor gave the problem with variables containing fractional exponents instead of integer exponents.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

I'm sure this is a simple question for the statisticians here. Say a tennis player wins 100 out of 200 points in a match. The player faces 30 break points in the match (not serving so well, apparently), and saves 20 of them. Is there evidence that the player plays ""better"" when facing break point? My thought (from my limited knowledge of statistics) is to compare the ratio $\frac{20}{30}$ of break-points-against won to the ratio $\frac{80}{170}$ of all other points won, with the expectation for each ratio being 50% $(=\frac{100}{200})$.

614439,On the definition of a geodesic in a metric space,"I am interested in the definition of geodesics in metric spaces. A definition which seems reasonable to me is that a geodesic should locally be a distance minimizer. Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic#Metric_geometry ) states that this naturally leads one to define a geodesic as a curve $\gamma: I \to M$, with $I\subset \mathbb{R}$ an interval and $M$ a metric space, such that for any $t \in I$ there is a neighbourhood $J$ of $t$ so that for any $t_1, t_2 \in J$ we have
$$
d(\gamma(t_1), \gamma(t_2)) = v |t_1 -t_2|,
$$
where $v \geq 0$ is any constant. Am I missing something obvious? Why is it that a curve satisfying this formula is locally minimizing the distance between its points?

614468,An extrasensory perception strategy :-),"Inspired by classical Joseph Banks Rhine experiments demonstrating an extrasensory perception (see, for instance, the beginning of the respective chapter of Jeffrey Mishlove book “The Roots of Consciousness”), I consider the following experiment. A deck of cards is given to a magician John. Then John consecutively takes the cards from the deck, trying to guess suit of the taken card. He looks at the card after the guess for a feedback. The magician wishes to maximize the expected number $E$ of right guesses. For this purpose he devised the following Strategy: at each turn to guess a suit which has a maximal number of card left in the deck. As an easy exercise we can prove that for any sequence of cards in the deck Strategy ensures at least $n$ right guesses, where $n$ is the maximal number of cards with one suit in the deck. But we can consider a more interesting and complicated problem to calculate the expectation $E$ for Strategy (here we are assuming that the deck is so well shuffled such that all sequences of cards have equal probability). By the way, I conjecture that Strategy is the best for maximizing the expectation $E$, that is any other strategy yields not greater value of $E$.
Now I wish to evaluate the expectation $E$ for Strategy. For the simplicity we shall consider only a case when there are only two suits ($m\ge 0$ cards of the first suit and $n\ge m$ cards of the second suit).  Then $E(0,n)=n$ for each $n$ and we have the following recurrence
$$E(m,n)=\frac{n}{m+n}(E(m,n-1)+1)+ \frac{m}{m+n}E(m-1,n)$$ for each $n\ge m\ge 1$. The rest is true provided I did not a stupid arithmetic mistake. I was interested mainly in asymptotics for the case $m=n$ and computer calculations suggested that $E(n,n)\sim n+c\sqrt{n}+o(\sqrt{n})$ for $c\approx 0.88\dots$. Evaluating formulas for $E(m,n)$ for small values of $m\le 6$, I conjectured that there is a general formula $$E(m,n)=n+m\sum_{i=1}^m\frac {c_{m,i}}{n+i}$$ for each $n\ge m\ge 1$, where $c_{m,i}$ are some integers satisfying the recurrence $$(m-i)c_{m,i}+ic_{m,i+1}=(m-1)c_{m-1,i}$$ for every $1\le i\le m-1$. Here are my values for $c_{m,i}$ i\m|  1   2   3   4   5   6

 1 |  1   2   4   8  16  32

 5 |                  1  10 
 6 |                     -1 Then I discovered that for my data $c_{m,i}$ is divisible by $2^{m-i}$. After I did the division, I surprisingly obtained that 
$$c_{m,i}=(-1)^{i-1}2^{m-i}{m-1 \choose i-1}.$$ I expect that I can easily prove this equality by induction. But I did not stop at this point because I observed that now the general formula for $E(m,n)$ can be compressed to the form $$E(m,n)=n+m\int_0^1 x^n(2-x)^{m-1} dx.$$ All of above sounds nice for me and I spent a good time investigating the problem, but I am a professional mathematician, although I am not a specialist in the domain of the above problem. Therefore I care about the following questions. Are the above results new, good and worthy to be published somewhere? What another related problems are worthy to be investigated?

614471,when can you estimate curvature from finite information about two geodesics?,"Let $c_v, c_w$ be two geodesics starting at a point $p\in M$, where M is a nonpositively curved, complete, smooth Riemannian manifold.  Say $c_v(\varepsilon) = \exp_p(\varepsilon v)$ and $c_w(\varepsilon) = \exp_p(\varepsilon w)$ for some tangent vectors $v,w\in T_p(M)$. Edit 3 : With the counterexamples in the answers in mind, we should assume the geodesics will need to form a triangle $\triangle(p, c_v(1),c_w(1))$ whose side lengths are within some (nonzero) lower and upper bounds. Let $L(\varepsilon)=\mathrm{dist}(c_v(\varepsilon),c_w(\varepsilon)$) be the distance between corresponding points $\varepsilon$ out on the geodesics. One can use the nonpositive curvature to get convexity of $L$ and prove that if $L(\varepsilon)$ looks linear at any one point, i.e. $L(\varepsilon_0) = \varepsilon_0 L(1)$, then this in fact is true for all $\varepsilon$, not just $\varepsilon_0$.  Consequently, the curvature of the $v,w$ plane at $p$ is $0$. Does an approximate version of this hold? That is, if we know some $\varepsilon_0$ has $L(\varepsilon_0)$ ""close to"" $\varepsilon_0 L(1)$, does this mean the sectional curvature of the $u,v$ plane at $p$ is ""close to"" $0$? This seems intuitive, at least if there's some kind of homogeneity or lots of symmetry , but I'm not very familiar with curvature, and can't seem to piece together a formal justification of this. If anyone knows and can explain this, or has a good reference to look at that discusses this function $L$ in detail, I'd appreciate it.  This seems like something that should be known or easy to someone in the area.  I've been trying to learn this material, and have seen a few references talking about geodesic variations and $L$ near $0$, but I'm not sure if I'm getting anywhere.  Of course, if it isn't true, I'd like to know why, or if it is true in slightly nicer spaces. Thanks! Edit To try to comment more on how I think an argument might go: My guess is that the curvature as you move along the geodesics is nonincreasing, so the amount of convexity (i.e. 2nd derivative) of $L(\varepsilon)$ is nondecreasing.  This, along with the convexity of $L$ provides some bounds on $L$ on $(0,\varepsilon_0)$.  Specifically, it must be under the line through $(0,0)$ and $(\varepsilon_0, L(\varepsilon_0))$ in order to be convex at all, and above the quadratic through $(0,0)$, $(\varepsilon_0, L(\varepsilon_0))$, and $(1,L(1))$ in order to satisfy the 2nd derivative requirement.  This seems to control the Riemannian angle and curvature at $p$. In what spaces would we know the curvature is nonincreasing and that argument makes some sense? Edit 2 The only answer below shows that this won't work as generally as I originally discussed this problem.  So, I'm interested in when it does hold.  I'm particularly interested in symmetric spaces, and my intuition is still firmly that this should be true in that setting.","['riemannian-geometry', 'curvature', 'differential-geometry']"
614474,What does this music video teach us about 863?,"This delightful animation by Stefan Nadelman depicts ""the additive evolution of prime numbers"", set to Lost Lander's song ""Wonderful World"": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZkQ65WAa2Q . (If you haven't watched it, you may want to do so before reading the rest of the question.) Counting $1$ as prime, the video shows a prime number growing up to $23$ by absorbing smaller primes during the first verse and chorus. In the second verse, swarms of $23$s and $53$s feed to form all the remaining two-digit primes from $29$ through $89$. During the final chorus, these primes then join together to form the primes $97, 131, 331, 281, 251$, and finally $863$. The video demonstrates that $863$ is the sum of 15 consecutive primes: $$863 = 29 + 31 + 37 + 41 + 43 + 47 + 53 + 59 + 61 + 67 + 71 + 73 + 79 + 83 + 89.$$ Is this just a coincidence? Is $863$ special? Or is there a reason to expect that a prime of about this size would be a consecutive sum of so many other primes? Obviously there's a lot of room for artistic license in designing an animation like this one. I'm interested in the ways that non-trivial mathematical considerations constrain the artist to choose certain designs over others, because through those constraints, the art might teach us something about mathematics.
