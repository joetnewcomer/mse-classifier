3033324,Is there a way to write the convolution form of a derivative?,"In image filtering and computer simulations, derivatives can be applied to a image by performing a convolution of the image/data with an appropriate kernel matrix. For example, in 1D this could be $ k = [-1,0,1]/2 $ This form makes sense for discrete, evenly spaced data. How would you express this in a general way? I'm thinking of something of the form: $\frac{df}{dx} = f * k$ $ k = ?$ Does this make sense?","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'convolution', 'image-processing']"
3033356,How can I deduce the hypotenuse from the information given?,I'm going into Machine Learning and am currently brushing up on some Calculus on Coursera.

The length of the ladder is $4$ meters longer than the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall. Find the length of the ladder.

3033407,Is a sample of size $N$ uniquely described by $N$ sample moments?,"I have the intuition that a sample of size $n$ should be able to be described uniquely by just N moments. But I don't know if that's true. The idea is that, first, it is obvious that a sample of $n = 1$ can be uniquely describe by just the sample mean. For $n = 2$ , knowing the first two (uncentered) moments is also enough because (if I did my maths correctly) $$
X_1 = 2\overline{X} - X_2
$$ and $$
M_2 = 1/2X_2^2 - 2M_1X_2+2M_1^2
$$ From which I can solve for $X_2$ and then $X_1$ by knowing $M_1$ and $M_2$ . It seems intuitive that this must hold on for $n > 2 $ . The generalization for a sample of size $n$ and $m$ moments would be \begin{matrix}
x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = nM_1\\ 
x_1^2 + x_2^2 +  ... + x_n^2 = nM_2 \\ 
       \vdots \\
 x_1^m + x_2^m + ... + x_n^m = nM_m
\end{matrix} It these were linear equations, they would only have an unique solution for $n = m$ if the system described a full rank matrix. But they aren't, so... no dice. From an information theory standpoint it seems to me (again, intuitively) that you shouldn't need more than $N$ numbers to represent any other $N$ numbers. Note that I'm not trying to estimate the population distribution by the sample moments. I'm talking about describing a specific vector of $n$ values. Also note that I assume that the order of samples does not matter so that $(x_1, x_2)$ and $(x_2, x_2)$ would be treated as the same solution. Any hints on this problem?",['statistics']

I suspect the answer is no, but I don't know how to prove it. All I know right now is that $f$ cannot be a covering map. For if $f$ is a covering map, take any $p\in S^2$ . Then $f$ restricts to a covering map from $S^2\backslash f^{-1}(p)$ to $S^2\backslash \{p\}$ . However, the fundamental group of $S^2\backslash f^{-1}(p)$ is $\mathbb{Z}$ and the fundamental group of $S^2\backslash \{p\}$ is trivial. That $f$ is a covering then gives that there is an injective homomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}$ to the trivial group, a contradiction. Thus $f$ cannot be a covering map. That's all I've got so far.

3033686,Leibniz integral rule for higher order derivatives,"Just wondering if there is a version of Leibniz integral rule for higher order derivatives. Specifically, I want to evaluate the differential $$
\frac{d^k}{dt^k}\int_0^t f(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau
$$ at $t = 0$ for arbitrary integer $k$ . Edit The Leibniz rule provides $$ \frac{d}{dt}\int_0^t f(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau = f(0) g(t) + \int_0^t f'(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau. $$ Then, $$ \frac{d^2}{dt^2}\int_0^t f(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau = f(0) g'(t) + f'(0) g(t) + \int_0^t f''(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau, $$ $$ \frac{d^3}{dt^3}\int_0^t f(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau = f(0) g''(t) + f'(0) g'(t) + f''(0) g(t) + \int_0^t f'''(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau, $$ etc. Eventually, $$ \frac{d^k}{dt^k}\int_0^t f(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau = f(0) g^{(k - 1)}(t) + f'(0) g^{(k - 2)}(t) + ... + f^{(k - 1)}(0)g(t) + \int_0^t f^{(k)}(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau. $$ Does $f(0) g^{(k - 1)}(t) + f'(0) g^{(k - 2)}(t) + ... + f^{(k - 1)}(0)g(t)$ stand for a simple expression. Apparently, $[f(t - \tau) g(\tau)]^{(k - 1)}_{t = \tau}$ is not what it should look like. Edit 2 What I have encountered so far is as follows: $$
\frac{d^k}{dt^k}\int_0^t f(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau = \sum_{n = 1}^k f^{(n - 1)}(0) g^{(k - n)}(t) + \int_0^t f^{(k)}(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau.
$$ Thus, evaluating both sides at $t = 0$ , we get $$
\left[\frac{d^k}{dt^k}\int_0^t f(t - \tau) g(\tau) d\tau\right]\bigg|_{t = 0} = \sum_{n = 1}^k f^{(n - 1)}(0) g^{(k - n)}(0).
$$ Can't encounter what the right hand side is.","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'derivatives']"

My Attempt During the exam I tried the following: $(A^2)^{-1} = A^{-1}B \Leftrightarrow A^2(A^2)^{-1} = A^2A^{-1}B \Leftrightarrow I_n = AB \Leftrightarrow A = B^{-1}$ And procedeed to find the inverse of B, which is: $A = B^{-1} = \left[ \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} &\frac{-5}{4} &  1\\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ \frac{1}{2}& \frac{1}{4}&0 \end{matrix} \right]$ But, as I tend to make silly mistakes, I figured out that it would be a better way to do find $A$ just by using matrix products. We had $I_n = AB \Leftrightarrow A = A^2B$ . Using this method I got that $A = A^2B = \left[ \begin{matrix} 2 & 0 &  2\\ 2 & 12 & -6 \\ -4& -8&12 \end{matrix} \right]$ But as you can see the $2$ matrix are different. Where is the mistake in my logic? Another thing I noticed is that $I_n = AB \Leftrightarrow A*I_n*B = A*(AB)*B \Leftrightarrow I_n = AB = A^2B^2$ , but $A^2B^2$ isn't the identity matrix, so maybe the exercise is wrong, but I rather not rush into that thinking.","['matrices', 'matrix-equations', 'linear-algebra']"

3033951,confusion about measurability requirements for Lebesgue integral,"So, it would appear I have forgotten the basic requirements of Lebesgue integration! Let $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)$ be an arbitrary $\sigma$ -finite measure space.  I'm particularly interested in the real numbers equipped with the Borel measure, which we could denote $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B},\beta)$ .  Similarly, let $(\overline{\mathbb{R}},\overline{\mathcal{B}},\beta)$ denote the set of extended reals equipped with the Borel measure. Question 1. What measurability conditions need to be true of a function $f:\Omega\to[-\infty,\infty]$ in order for its Lebesgue integral $\int_\Omega f\;d\mu$ to be well-defined? Definition. Let $(\Omega_1,\Sigma_1)$ and $(\Omega_2,\Sigma_2)$ be measure spaces, i.e. nonempty sets equipped with $\sigma$ -algebras.  A function $f:\Omega_1\to\Omega_2$ is called $(\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2)$ - measurable if and only if $f^{-1}(A)\in\Sigma_1$ for all $A\in\Sigma_2$ . I have been laboring for some time under the impression that $f$ needs to be $(\Sigma,\overline{\Lambda})$ -measurable, where $(\overline{\mathbb{R}},\overline{\Lambda},\lambda)$ denotes the extended real numbers equipped with the Lebesgue measure. However, I've just been reading both Bogachev and Royden, and they seem to be requiring only that $f$ be ""measurable"" in the following sense:  that $\{x:f(x)<c\}\in\Sigma$ for every $c\in\mathbb{R}$ , and also $f^{-1}(\infty),f^{-1}(-\infty)\in\Sigma$ .  This turns out to be equivalent to saying that $f$ is $(\Sigma,\overline{\mathcal{B}})$ -measurable. But there are functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to[-\infty,\infty]$ which are $(\mathcal{B},\overline{\mathcal{B}})$ -measurable but not $(\mathcal{B},\overline{\Lambda})$ -measurable.  For instance, take the usual example of the homeomorphism $g:[0,2]\to[0,1]$ built out of the Cantor ""devil's staircase"" function, and extend it to all of $\mathbb{R}$ by letting $g(x)=g(0)$ whenever $x<0$ and $g(x)=g(2)$ whenever $x>2$ .  Then $g$ is continuous and hence $(\mathcal{B},\overline{\mathcal{B}})$ -measurable, but it is not $(\mathcal{B},\overline{\Lambda})$ -measurable.  Is $g$ really integrable? So, I guess Question 1 can be made more specific by breaking it up into the following: Question 2. Does the definition of the Lebesgue integral of a function $f:\Omega\to[-\infty,\infty]$ require that $f$ be $(\Sigma,\overline{\Lambda})$ -measurable, or is $(\Sigma,\overline{\mathcal{B}})$ -measurability good enough? I've also noticed that some of the Lemmas and Propositions involved with the Lebesgue integral require that $\Sigma$ be complete , i.e it contains all subsets of sets of measure zero.  The Borel $\sigma$ -algebra is the one I'm most interested in, but it is not complete.  So: Question 3. Does the definition of the Lebesgue integral of a function $f:\Omega\to[-\infty,\infty]$ require that $(\Omega,\Sigma)$ be complete?  In particular, is $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B})$ allowed to be used for the domain of $f$ ? According to my reading of the Royden and Bogachev texts, the answer to question 2 appears to be that we only need $(\Sigma,\overline{\mathcal{B}})$ -measurability, not $(\Sigma,\overline{\Lambda})$ -measurability.  And the answer to question 3 appears to be that no, $(\Omega,\Sigma)$ need not be complete, and that $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B})$ is allowed to be used.  But this seems suspicious, and I am not convinced I have understood the texts correctly. Any help would be much appreciated.

My thought : a) From the total of 10 cars, 3 of them belong to permanent residents and the other 7 to ""temporary"" residents so I will refer to them from now on with $P$ and $T$ respectively. It is obvious that we have a case of circular arrangement here ( I think that's how is called in English).

Suppose you pick a coloring uniformly at random from the set of allowed coloring. How many ways can the cube be arranged such that the red face is adjacent to the blue face, assuming red and blue are among the six allowed colors.(Keeping rotation in mind so A=red B=blue is the same as A=blue, B=red, and counts as one case) I am getting confused, with 4, 10 and 24 as possible answers. 4: Since the cube can be rotated, assume B is fixed to the front face of the cube. Hence, there are 4 possible ways R can be oriented around B. Since there are rotations, it is redundant to multiply by the 6 faces on the cube. Hence 4 ways. 10: If I map out the cube by drawing 4 horizontal boxes and 1 box below and 1 box above, and assign B to each face, I count the number of ways R can be next to B for each box, and arrive at 10. 24: Similar concept to 4, just multiplied by 6.

3034286,Is it trivial that the Levi-Civita connection can be pulled back to a isometric manifold?,"Let $M, N$ be Riemannian Manifolds and $\phi: M \to N$ a isometric diffeomorphism. We know that we have unique Levi-Civita Connections $\nabla^M, \nabla^N$ on $M, N$ respectively. One can check that $\tilde\nabla^N_V W = \phi^*\nabla^N_{\phi_* V}\phi_* W$ satisfies the properties of a Levi-Civita connection and hence (by uniqueness) $\tilde\nabla^N = \nabla^M$ . However it seems to me that this should be trivial , since $M$ and $N$ are ""the same"" (when identified via $\phi$ ) as far as their differentiable structures and metrics are concerned. Since the properties of a Levi-Civita connection are expressed using only ""the language of Riemannian manifolds"" (i.e. smooth functions, vector fields, the metric, etc.) it seems that it should be obvious that $\tilde\nabla^N$ is a Levi-Civita connection on $M$ . To me this seems analogous to other trivial facts like The tangent bundles of diffeomorphic manifolds are isomorphic (as vector bundles) The centers of isomorphic groups are isomorphic (Number 1 can actually be argued to follow from the functoriality of taking tangent spaces, but AFAIK there is no suitable functor that works for 2). So is it a valid argument to say that the Levi-Civita connection can be pulled back to $M$ because the two manifolds are ""the same in every relevant aspect""? Also is there any way to generalize this kind of argument? EDIT: It feels to me like this question (and the other two facts I stated) are an example of the following principle: Since $\phi$ preserves all structures on $M$ and $N$ (that is a Topological space, a smooth structure and a metric) and The Levi-Civita connections only depends on these structures they are equivalent (using $\phi$ to ""translate"" them). For the center of a group you would argue analogously, saying that it only depends on the group structure, which is preserved by group isomorphisms. Therefore the centers must be isomorphic (with the isomorphism given by the isomorphism on the groups).

3034620,How to play a betting game,"I have been interviewing in a few trading firms recently. I came up with the following question myself, but it is similar to some of the questions they ask and ways of thinking they expect. Suppose you have some capital to invest (for example \$100). You can play a game where you bet \$x of your money and with probability $\frac{2}{3}$ your bet is doubled (so now you have \$(100 + x)) and with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ you lose your bet (so now you have \$(100 - x)). How much should you bet on this game. I can see two ways of thinking about this problem. Firstly, there is the expected value maximisation approach. It can be easily seen that your expected gain in this game is $\frac{x}{3}$ . So in order to maximise EV you should bet all of your money instantly. And if you were to play this game a million times, you should bet all of your money each time. Of course this approach has the obvious flaw that when you play a few times, you will almost certainly go bankrupt. So we decide not to maximise EV and instead first make sure that we never go bankrupt. We do it by deciding to, at each point of the game, always bet exactly the same proportion of our money, say $p$ . Then after $n=n_1+n_2$ games, where our bet was doubled $n_1$ times and we lost $n_2$ times, we will have $M \cdot (1+p)^{n_1} \cdot (1-p)^{n_2}$ money, where $M$ was our initial amount. Differentiating the log of this with respect to $p$ we can see that this function has its maximum for $p=\frac{n_1-n_2}{n} \rightarrow \frac{2}{3}-\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ . So if we bet just a third of our money every time, we are (almost) guaranteed not to go bankrupt and, out of the strategies that bet a constant proportion every time, this one maximises our gain in the most likely outcome. So here is my question - does this second strategy make sense to you? If you were to play this game with your own money would you use it? Does it make any sense to use a different strategy if you only play once, and not many times? I personally would be tempted to bet more than a third if I only got one chance, because it would increase my EV even if it is potentially bad in the long term. Does this sentiment make any sense? Also, I just described two ways of thinking about the game above. Do you know of any other ways to think about it? Other strategies?

RV's $U_1, \dots, U_n$ , where $U_i \sim \operatorname{Uniform}(0,n)$ , inasmuch as he shows that they have the same density (cf. p.49 of Keener, Theoretical Statistics ). (Here $F$ of course denotes the CDF of each of the observations $X_i$ .) Cramer says later that we can assume $\Xi_n$ ""is bounded"" - but in what sense precisely is that true? Question: What is the almost sure rate of growth of the random variables $\Xi_n$ ? Of $\log(\Xi_n)$ ? In particular, is it true that $\log(\Xi_n) = o(\log\log n)$ almost surely? $\log(\Xi_n) = o(\log\log n)$ a.s. appears to be sufficient to show that $\max_{1 \le i \le n} X_i \sim \sqrt{2 \log n}$ a.s. where the $X_i \sim \mathscr{N}(0,1)$ , using the argument found here , hence my interest. In a community wiki ""answer"" below I have posted what I believe to be a proof that $\Xi_n = o(\log n)$ a.s., at least when the $X_i \sim \mathscr{N}(0,1)$ , an assumption which would be considered acceptable for any accepted answer. Note that, it appears to be sufficient to show that for all $\varepsilon >0$ , $\Xi_n = o((\log n)^{\varepsilon})$ a.s. in order to conclude $\log (\Xi_n) = o(\log \log n)$ a.s. Note: For each $n$ , $\Xi_n$ has the distribution of the maximum of $n$ i.i.d. uniforms supported on $[0,n]$ ( not $[0,1]$ or $[0, \theta]$ for some fixed constant), so this problem does not seem completely trivial. Note 2: Following the argument below, it seems it suffices to show that (assuming this is even true), for any $\epsilon >0$ , $\delta > 0$ that: $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(\log n)^\delta}{n (\exp ((\log n)^\delta  ))^\epsilon } < \infty \,.$$ I haven't been able to figure out how to control (i.e. bound) the $\exp ( (\log n)^\delta )$ term/factor usefully. (Comparing with this , the case where $\alpha=1$ and $\beta < 1$ , seems to show that this is actually false for $\delta < 1$ or small enough. Which would be OK since this would only be sufficient, not necessary, anyway.) Note 3: If it really is true that $\Xi_n$ is stochastically dominated by an exponential random variable (with parameter $1$ ) for all $n$ , then maybe it's possible to get the necessary asymptotic probabilistic bound more easily for exponentials and then use the stochastic dominance to conclude.","['probability-limit-theorems', 'asymptotics', 'order-statistics', 'upper-lower-bounds', 'probability-theory']"

Compute the power of the hypothesis test. So, I know a few things that could be useful: For the first question I know that the power function is defined as $$\mathbb{P}[\text{Reject } \ H_0 \mid \mu]$$ where $\mu$ is the mean of the sample. So I need to compute: $$\mathbb{P}[\overline{X} > 0.8 \mid \mu]$$ So far, I know that $$\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\sim N(0,1)$$ And also that for independent $X_i \sim Ber(\theta)$ then $Y = \sum_{i=1}^{10}X_i \sim Bin(10,\theta)$ and $\mathbb{E}(Y) = 10\theta, \ \sigma_Y = \sqrt{10(\theta)(1-\theta)}$ . Maybe it is a simple exercise but I'm having trouble figuring out the value of $\mu$ . For example, for the third question, when I compute the power of the test I did it this way: \begin{align}
\text{Power} &= \mathbb{P}[\overline{X} > 0.8 \mid \theta = 0.75]\\

&= \mathbb{P} [Z > -15.47]\\
&= 1-\phi(-15.47)\\
&= 1

The other part of the question was to show that $x^5 - 4x + 2$ was irreducible over $\mathbb Q(i)$ .  I got that one.  Clearly the polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb Q$ by Eisenstein and Gauss' lemma, and, since $5$ and $2$ are relatively prime, it follows from a previous exercise that a root of the polynomial must have degree $5$ over $\mathbb Q(i)$ . So the given polynomial must be the root's minimal polynomial over $\mathbb Q(i)$ (and not just over $\mathbb Q$ ).  So in particular the polynomial must be irreducible over $\mathbb Q(i)$ . But that trick doesn't work for $x^5 - 4x + 2$ anymore, and I'm stumped.

3034819,How many colors are necessary for a rectangle to never cover a color more than once?,"If we have an infinite grid, and we color each cell, how many colors do we need so that a $m \times n$ rectangle always covers at most 1 of each color no matter how it is placed? (Rotation of the rectangle is allowed.) It must be at least $mn$ , but it seems $mn$ is not always enough. Know results: For $m \times 1$ , the answer is $m$ . For $m \times m$ it is $m^2$ . Here is data from a computer program. Note that my program only considers periodic colorings with fundamental region the same area as the number of colors. So it is possible that colorings with less colors are possible if they are not arranged in this way. The table below shows $k - mn$ , where $k$ is the number of colors needed. The pattern seems obvious now (although a proof is still needed). A few conjectures: For all cases in the table, if $mn$ is not enough, then it looks like $mn + m$ is for $m < n$ . ( False. turns out this is not true; $6 \times 4$ seems to require 32 colors. I updated the table above.) From my constructions it looks like $mn$ may be sufficient once $m$ is large enough for fixed $n$ (and vice versa). This is consistent with how rectangular tilings work. ( Seems False. ) From  Gregory J. Puleo's comment: If $m$ divides $n$ , it is plausible that $mn$ is enough. (If $m$ divides $n$ , we can consider the rectangle a bar of larger squares, so by combining 1. and 2. from above we may be able to prove this.) ( True. See his answer.) For $m \times (m + 1)$ , the program finds colorings using $m(m + 2)$ colors. The fundemental region can be described by a parallelogram with two adjacent sides $(m(m + 2), 0)$ and $(m + 1, 1)$ . These squares are marked yellow in the first table. Edit: In fact, for rectangles represented by a white cell it seems that for $m \times (m + k)$ we need $m(m + 2k)$ colors. It looks like for $m \times n$ where $n = jm, jm - 1, jm - 2, \cdots, \lfloor\frac{m + 2}{2}\rfloor$ and all $j$ , we need $jm^2$ colors. These squares are marked green in the first table. Does anyone know in general how many colors we need? Background While trying to find all the fault-free tilings of the P-pentomino , I noticed that we can prove that the P-pentomino does not tile any $5 \times n$ rectangle for odd $n$ , because such a rectangle does not fit $n$ $2 \times 2$ squares, and therefor can also not fit $n$ P-pentominoes. This made me wonder how close we can generally come to tiling a rectangle with an arbitrary given rectangle. In general, rectangles pack and tile in complicated ways, so a direct analysis seems too hard. (For example, we can fit 4 $2 \times 3$ rectangles in a $5 \times 5$ rectangle in a pinwheel tiling construction.)  Then I though of extending this technique to find how many rectangles will fit. But that only works if we need $mn$ colors for a $m \times n$ rectangle... and when I discovered this is not always the case, I wondered what is the general rule.","['combinatorics', 'tiling', 'packing-problem']"
3034825,Determinant of the second fundamental form in Gauss's curvature,"At this point on a Prof. Norman J Wildberger's presentation on Gauss's curvature and the the Theorema Egregium the curvature of a manifold $S$ at a point $p$ is written down as the determinant of the derivative map of Gauss-Rodrigues ( $N$ ) from $S$ to the 2-sphere of radius $1,$ $S^2,$ at that point: If $\vec r$ denotes the function from the parametric space to the surface $S,$ and $\mathrm dN$ the derivative of the Gauss map taking vectors from $T_pS$ to $T_{N(p)}S^2,$ the ratio of the determinant of the function composition $\mathrm dN\circ \vec r$ to the determinant of the function $\vec r$ is the Gauss curvature: $$K(p) = \det \mathrm dN(p)=\frac{\mathrm dA(S^2)}{\mathrm dA(S)}=\frac{\det\left(\mathrm dN\circ \vec r\right)}{\det \vec r}=\frac{eg-f^2}{EG-F^2}$$ Or the Jacobian of the transformation between the two patches in the following diagram: This is concordant with the first alternative formula : $$K =\frac{\det \mathrm {II}}{\det \mathrm I}$$ of the determinant of the second fundamental form (i.e. the component along the normal vector of the second partial derivative of $\vec r$ with respect to the basis vectors in the tangent plane) to the first fundamental forms (i.e. the metric tensor). Above the coefficients of the first fundamental form are $E=\langle r_u,r_u\rangle,$ $F=\langle r_u,r_v\rangle,$ $G=\langle r_v,r_v\rangle.$ The first fundamental form measures the distortion in lengths of the curves in the domain $(u,v),$ i.e. $L(\beta(t))=\int_0^t \vert \beta'(t)\vert dt=\int_0^t\left((u'(t)^2 + v'(t)^2\right)^{1/2}dt$ as compared to the charted curve on $S,$ i.e. $L(\alpha(t))=\int_0^t \vert\alpha'(t)\vert dt=\int_0^t \left( 
u'(t)^2 E + 2 u'(t)v'(t) F + v'(t)^2 G \right)^{1/2}dt.$ Likewise it measures the distortion in the measurement of areas on $S$ through the determinant of the first fundamental form expressed as a matrix - $\det \begin{vmatrix}E&F\\F&G\end{vmatrix}=EG-F^2,$ i.e. the area of a $\vec r(V)$ patch on $S,$ corresponding to the image of a patch in $(u,v),$ is $A=\int_V \vert r_u \times r_v \vert du dv = \int_V \left(EG - F^2 \right)^{1/2}du dv.$ See here . He writes $e,$ for example, as the image to a tangent vector $r_u$ on $S$ at point $p,$ i.e. $\mathrm dN_p(r_u)$ dotted with $r_u:$ $\bbox[5px,border:2px solid red]{ e =\mathrm dN_p(r_u)\cdot r_u = N \cdot r_{uu} }$ My question is why this last equality is true, including both the LHS and the RHS. The other entries in the matrix being $ f =\mathrm dN_p(r_u)\cdot r_v =\mathrm dN_p(r_v)\cdot r_u = N \cdot r_{uv}$ and $g = \mathrm dN_p(r_v)\cdot r_u = N \cdot r_{vv} .$ I don't understand the application of the Gauss map to a tangent vector $r_u$ since the idea seems to be to apply it the normal vector to $S$ at the point $p.$ So applying it to a vector in the tangent space doesn't seem to make sense; yet it results in the dot product of the normal vector $N$ and the second derivative of $r$ with respect to $u.$ My bet is that $\mathrm dN$ may indicate the pushforward of the tangent space where $r_u$ is located. This wouldn't alter $r_u,$ given that the tangent space at $S^2$ is the same as at $S.$ Note to self: The first and second fundamental forms, as well as the differential of the Gauss map are all operators on the tangent space, and can be represented as matrices with respect to the basis of the tangent space $\{r_u,r_v\}.$ The matrix of the first fundamental form is: $$M=\begin{bmatrix}\vert r_u \vert^2 & r_u\cdot r_v\\ r_v\cdot ru & \vert r_v\vert^2
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} E & F\\F &G
\end{bmatrix}$$ The matrix of the second fundamental form is composed of the following entries: Second fundamental form applied to $r_u,$ which is defined as: $$e=\mathrm{II}_p(r_u,r_u)=- dN(r_u)\cdot r_u=-\langle dN(r_u),r_u\rangle=-\langle N_u,r_u\rangle$$ and since $$\langle N,r_u \rangle=0$$ we can differentiate both sides with respect to $u:$ $$\begin{align}
\frac{d}{du}\langle N,r_u\rangle&=0\\
\langle N_u,r_u\rangle + \langle N,r_{uu}\rangle&=0
\end{align}$$ and hence, $$e=\langle N,r_{uu}\rangle$$ Similarly, $$f=\mathrm{II}_p(r_u,r_v)=-\langle dN(r_u),r_v\rangle=-\langle N_u,r_v\rangle=\langle N,r_{uv}\rangle$$ because $\langle N,r_v\rangle=0$ and $$\begin{align}
\frac{d}{du}\langle N,r_v\rangle&=0\\
\langle N_u,r_v\rangle + \langle N,r_{uv}\rangle&=0

It should be roughly as tight as the standard Chernoff bound, something like $e^{-\Omega(k\sqrt t)}$ would be nice.

I looked at $\exp(i t X^2 Y^2) = e^{i/(8t)} K_0(i/(8t))/\sqrt{\pi i t}$ , but I don't know how to get a tail bound using the characteristic function. I also considered moment bounds. We have $E(X^2 Y^2)^k=2^{2k}\Gamma(k+1/2)^2/\pi\le2(2k/e)^{2k}$ , but to get a tail bound I need $E(\sum_i X_i^2 Y_i^2)^k$ , which is of course a lot harder to estimate.

3035206,Why is the classification of topological spaces up to homeomorphism impossible or undesirable?,"In multiple sources (say here and here ) I've see it asserted that a classification of topological spaces up to homeomorphism is either impossible, undesirable because homeomorphism is too strong, or both. (So, the next sentence will go, we should try classifying spaces up to homotopy equivalence instead). Unfortunately, I've never seen someone elaborate on why classifying spaces by homeomorphism is either impossible or inconveniently strong. Regarding the former statement, what's the easiest way of demonstrating that classification up to homeomorphism is ridiculously hard or impossible, or a particularly good example of why that's the case? But more importantly, the latter statement - that classification up to homeomorphism wouldn't even be a desirable thing anyway, because it's too fine an equivalence - is not obvious to me at all. In many realistic contexts, homeomorphism isn't even strong enough for what we want to achieve, and we instead need to talk about things like diffeomorphisms between smooth manifolds. Homotopy equivalence is often inconveniently weak, as it doesn't respect topological properties that are pretty important, like compactness in particular. So I don't get why classification up to homotopy equivalence would be a priori better, only why it would be simpler - but as I've said, those two sources seem to me like they are sort of making the claim that it would be better . So there are some steps missing here for me. I'd appreciate either a quick explanation or, preferred, a reference for a longer one.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

I am self teaching some differential geometry and I don't quite understand the difference between two things. So I understand that a chart is a mapping between a subset of the manifold and Eulclidean space, but what I don't understand is how this relates to maps of the Earth. I have read that it is impossible to represent the surface of the Earth/sphere with just a single chart. However, there are definitely maps of the earth that encompass every point. I have seen one that is centered around the north pole, for example, that includes the whole surface - except the south pole is definitely misrepresented somewhat, as it is wrapped around the edges. So what is it about map projections that means they are not considered charts? One presumes some level of maths is needed to perform a map projection, are there specific rules for what makes a chart a chart? And presumably these rules are broken for map projections?","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

3035280,Finding a set of matrices based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors with constraints,"I'm trying to solve the following problem and hope for some helpful insights on how to approach this: In the 3-dimensional case, for and a given set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and chosen values $a$ and $b$ , $c$ , find the set of 3 by 3 matrices that have the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors (if it exists). Some elements of the matrix and eigenvectors are fixed values. For example in the 3-dimensional case: Eigenvalues: $ \lambda_1=3 $ , $\lambda_2 = -1$ and $\lambda_3 = 2$ Eigenvectors: $v_1=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\a  \end{bmatrix} $ , $ v_2=\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ b \\1  \end{bmatrix} $ and $ v_3=\begin{bmatrix} c \\ 0 \\-1  \end{bmatrix} $ The matrix has the following fixed elements: $$ \begin{bmatrix} x_{11} & 2 & x_{13} \\ x_{21} & x_{22} & 1 \\ x_{31} & 3 & x_{33} \end{bmatrix} $$ In other words: Let's say I set $a=2$ and $b=-1$ and $c=1$ . What are the possible matrices with fixed values $x_{12}=2$ , $x_{23}=1$ and $x_{32}=3$ with eigenvalues $ \lambda_1=3 $ , $\lambda_2 = -1$ and $\lambda_3 = 2$ and eigenvectors $v_1=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\2  \end{bmatrix} $ , $ v_2=\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\1  \end{bmatrix} $ and $ v_3=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\-1  \end{bmatrix} $ . Also, it would be interesting to know under what circumstances solutions exist and how many possible solutions there are? My first idea was to solve the eigenvalue equations for each eigenvalue and eigenvector: $$ (A-\lambda I)v=0 $$ for example for $\lambda_1$ and $v_1 $ : $$ \begin{bmatrix} x_{11}-3 & 2 & x_{13} \\ x_{21} & x_{22}-3 & 1 \\ x_{31} & 3 & x_{33}-3 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\2  \end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\0  \end{bmatrix} $$ However, the values of $x$ must be true for all eigenvectors and not just for one. So I got stuck (or I'm missing something). My second idea was to use the fact that a matrix $M$ can be obtained when knowing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues by $M=PDP^{-1}$ where $P$ is the matrix with the eigenvectors as columns and $D$ the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. However, this does not take care of the constraints. Stuck again.","['linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

3035452,"Error in solution of Peter Winkler ""red and blue dice"" puzzle?","This question relates to the solution give in Peter Winkler's Mathematical Mind-Benders to the ""Red and Blue Dice"" problem appearing on page $23.$ You have two sets (one red, one blue) of $n\ n-$ sided dice, each die labeled with the numbers from $1$ to $n.$ You roll all $2n$ dice simultaneously. Prove that there must be a nonempty subset of the red dice and a nonempty subset of the blue dice with the same sum! I tried to prove it by induction.  There must be an $n$ rolled or we can remove one die of each color and get a counterexample to the $n-1$ case.  If there is only on $n$ rolled, we can remove it, and any die of the other color, and again get a counterexample.  So there are at least two red $n$ 's, say. But I couldn't carry the induction idea any further.  I proved it up to $n=6,$ hoping to spot a pattern, but all I got was a collection of ad hoc arguments.  After several days, I gave up and looked at the answer. A solution is given on pages $33-34.$ Winkler advises proving a stronger statement. In fact, there is a much stronger statement than the one you were asked to prove, which is nonetheless still true.  Organize the red dice into a line, in any way you want, and do the same with the blue dice.  Then there is a contiguous nonempty subset of each line with the same sum. To put it more mathematically, given any two vector $\langle a_1,\dots,a_n\rangle$ and $\langle b_1,\dots,b_n\rangle$ in $\{1,\dots,n\}^n,$ there are $j\le k$ and $s\le t$ such that $\sum_{i=j}^k{a_i}=\sum_{i=s}^t{b_i}.$ To see this, let $\alpha_m$ be the sum of the first $m\ a_i$ 's and let $\beta_m$ be the sum of the first $m\ b_i$ 's.  Assume that $\alpha_n\le\beta_n$ (otherwise we can switch the roles of the $a$ 's and $b$ 's), and for each $m,$ let $m'$ be the greatest index for which $\beta_{m'}\le\alpha_m.$ Winkler gives a diagram with two sample strings, lines joining $a_m$ and $b_{m'}$ labeled by $\alpha_m-\beta_{m'}$ It is apparent that the $a_i$ are the dice on top and the $b_i$ those on bottom.  Note that we have $\alpha_6=22,\ \beta_6=18,$ contradicting $\alpha_n\le\beta_n,$ so I imagine that the latter was a typo.  Also, the line labeled $3$ joining $a_3$ and $b_4$ should really end at $b_5$ and be labeled $0,$ but I guess this is just a mistake. Anyway, Winkler says, We always have $\alpha_m-\beta_{m'}\ge0,$ and at most $n-1$ (if $\alpha_m-\beta_{m'}$ were larger than or equal to $n,\ m'$ would have been a larger index.) He then goes on to observe that if any of the labels is $0$ we are done, so we have $n$ labels from $1$ to $n-1$ and two are equal.  Then the sum of the intervening dice must be the same.  For example, in the picture we have two lines labeled $2,$ and we have $6+5+3=3+2+3+6.$ It seems to me that there are two holes in this proof.  The first is in the statement that the labels must be less than $n$ .  Suppose that $\alpha_n-\beta_n\ge n.$ Then $n'=n,$ and there is no larger index available.  Then  perhaps $\alpha_n\le\beta_n$ is right after all, and the diagram is wrong. But this leaves the second problem, which doesn't depend on the relation between $\alpha_n$ and $\beta_n.$ Suppose that $a_1<b_1.$ How is $1'$ to be defined? I thought about abandoning the stronger statement, and attempting to solve the puzzle by arranging the $a_i$ in decreasing order and the $b_i$ in increasing order, but I don't see how to dispose of the case $\max{a_i}>\min{b_i}.$ Winkler's argument can't be applied, and I don't see how to dispose of it otherwise. I haven't been able to rescue this proof.  Am I overlooking something?  Can you solve the puzzle? Note: Winkler say that some similar results can be found in a paper by Diaconis, Graham, and Sturmfels.  I haven't tried to read the paper yet, but it looks a little heavy for the solution to a puzzle. Also, Winkler says that the source of the puzzle was David Kempe of USC, ""who needed the result in a computer science paper,"" but gives no further reference. P.S.

Is the idea that formulas can only be countably infinite, and that even with such a long formula it is only countably infinite? How would one prove that formulas in predicate logic can only be such? Edit Answers along the lines of ""formulas are defined to be of finite length"" I find unsatisfying, for the following reason: the rule for forming disjunctions doesn't say that we can't go on to form $A \lor A \lor...$ . If it did a disjunction would be defined as something which can only be of length $n$ for some $n$ . So I fail to see how Asaf's answer answers my question. I think the import of the answer is that it is a precondition of something being a formula in standard predicate logic that it be of finite length.

If you are a functional analyst that distinguishes between $L^p$ and $L_p$ , then could you please let me know what $L_p$ means (presumably, your definition of $L^p$ coincides with Wikipedia's definition )? Now, I found another similar notation $\mathscr{L}_p$ .  What is $\mathscr{L}_p$ ?  There seem to be $\mathscr{L}^p$ , $\mathcal{L}^p$ , and $\mathcal{L}_p$ too.  However, I would expect that this is just due to people's using different fonts, i.e., $L^p=\mathscr{L}^p=\mathcal{L}^p$ and $L_p=\mathscr{L}_p=\mathcal{L}_p$ .","['notation', 'definition', 'lp-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'soft-question']"
3035823,Differential of Hopf's map,"Let $$h : \mathbb{C^2} \rightarrow \mathbb{C \times R} $$ $$h(z_1, z_2) = (2z_1z_2^*, |z_1|^2-|z_2|^2)$$ How do you find the differential of $h$ and show it is onto/surjective? I know that I can express $h$ as $\mathbb{R^4}$ instead of $\mathbb{C^2}$ , but then how do I proceed? Do I just differentiate with respect to each $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ instead of $z_1, z_2$ given that $x_2, x_4$ are the imaginary part? So, let's say $h(z_1, z_2)$ becomes $$h(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) = (2(x_1+x_2i)(x_3-x_4i),\  x_1^2+x_2^2-x_3^2-x_4^2) \\ \rightarrow (2(x_1x_3 + x_2x_4), 2(x_2x_3-x_1x_4), x_1^2+x_2^2-x_3^2-x_4^2)$$ But if I start differentiating $h$ with respect to each variable, I am getting a Jacobian matrix $\mathbb{R^{3 \times 4}}$ . I think I am doing something wrong here.","['complex-analysis', 'hopf-fibration', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

Show $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} x_n=a$ . I think I can see why intuitively. For large $n$ , in $\sum\limits_{k=1}^n t_{n,k}a_k$ , we are summing big portion of term of the form $\epsilon_j (a\pm\epsilon_i)$ , so it is approximately $(1-\epsilon)a+\epsilon*First\_few\_term\_of\_a_n \approx a$ . Is there clever ways to prove it?",['analysis']

3035862,When is a set infinite,"Prove a set A is infinite if and only if it has a subset B ⊂ A such that B $\neq$ A and
|B| = |A|. For the direction where we have B as a subset of A and have |B| = |A| and need to prove A is infinite,
I want to say that this should work- Say A is finite. Then B is finite, by way of being a proper subset of A. Therefore, cardinalities of A and B cannot be the same since there exists no bijection between them. This is a contradiction to our hypothesis that they are indeed the same. Hence, A must be infinite. For the direction where we show if A is infinite, then there must exist B (a proper subset) such that cardinalities of A and B are same, I said this: If there exists a proper subset B such that cardinalities of A and B are not same, then there exists no bijection between A and B. This is true for finite sets. Now how do I move to say that this must mean infinite sets do not have this property? NOTE: I'm taking an introductory level class in proof writing and there has been no mention of the axiom of choice.",['elementary-set-theory']

3035890,"How to calculate $\mathbb{P}(|U_{1} - U_{2}| < \frac{1}{12})$, where $U_{i} \sim \mathcal{U}(0, \frac{1}{2})$ and $U_{i}$ are independent.","We have a Poisson process of intensity $\lambda = 4$ . We have the following event: $A$ : ""Two marks appear with a separation of $\frac{1}{12}$ or less"". We need to calculate the probability of exactly two ""marks"" appearing between $0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ , and $A$ ocurring at the same time. That is, the probability of exactly two marks ocurring in $(0, \frac{1}{2})$ with a separation of $\frac{1}{12}$ or less. Here's how far I've gotten: Let $N$ : Number of marks between $0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ . We want: $$\mathbb{P}(N=2, A) = \mathbb{P}(A|N=2)\mathbb{P}(N=2) $$ $N\sim Poi(\frac{1}{2}4)$ , so: $$\mathbb{P}(N=2) = \frac{2^2}{2!}e^{-2} = 2e^{-2}$$ The arrival times for a conditioned number of marks (in this case two) is $U_{1}$ , and $U_{2}$ , where $U_{i} \sim \mathcal{U}(0, \frac{1}{2})$ , and $U_{i}$ are independent, so: $$\mathbb{P}(A|N=2) = \mathbb{P}(\max(U_{1}, U_{2}) - \min(U_{1}, U_{2}) < \frac{1}{12}) = \mathbb{P}\left(|U_{1} - U_{2}| < \frac{1}{12}\right)$$ This is where I'm stuck. The answer is supposed to be $\frac{11}{18}e^{-2}$ , so $\mathbb{P}\left(|U_{1} - U_{2}| < \frac{1}{12}\right)$ should be $\frac{11}{36}$ .

3035906,Tangent space of preimage is the preimage of the tangent space,"Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds with $S\subseteq N$ a submanifold, and assume a map $f:M\to N$ is smooth and transverse to $S$ . Prove that $T_p(f^{-1}(S)) = (df_p)^{-1}(T_{f(p)}S)$ for some $p\in f^{-1}(S)$ . I have found two instances of this question asked here and here , but neither question is given a complete solution (and the OPs seem satisfied with their hints). I thought that the answer would be a simple unwinding of the definitions of $df_p$ and $T_xM$ , but I wasn't able to push it through. It would be most helpful if the definition of $T_xM$ used was the set of derivations, and not the ""use a path"" definition. This is the definition that was emphasized most in my course, and is the one I am most comfortable with. This is not homework -- I'm just trying to study for an exam.","['differential-topology', 'transversality', 'differential-geometry']"
