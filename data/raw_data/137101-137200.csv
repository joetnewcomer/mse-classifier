2184389,Tensor product. Simple tensors.,"I have the following problem in my assignment: Prove that every element of $V \otimes W$ can be represented as $\sum \limits_{i = 1}^{k} v_i \otimes w_i$, where $v_i$ are linearly independent and $w_i$ are linearly independent. I thought that we can do the following:
Every tensor can be written as a linear combination of basis vectors $e_i \otimes f_j$, so we can represent this tensor as sum: $\sum \limits_{i = 1}^{n} e_i \otimes w_i$ (using tensor and summation properties). So, I have similar representation, but second components might be linearly dependent. My question is am I thinking in the right direction, and if so how I can transform this representation to make vectors in second component linearly independent?","['tensor-products', 'tensors', 'linear-algebra']"

2184430,Minimization of Frobenius Norm and Schur Complement,"There is a famous problem Optimization of Frobenius Norm and Nuclear Norm ; however, this is not I want to ask (about proximal operator). Suppose I have an easy optimization problem: $$\min_Q \|Q-Q_N\|_F$$ where $\|\cdot\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm: $\|X\|_F = (\operatorname{tr}(X^TX))^{\frac{1}{2}}$ . We know we can consider the following: $$\mathcal{A}(Q,t) = \begin{bmatrix}I & Q-Q_N\\ (Q-Q_N)^T & tI \end{bmatrix}\succeq 0$$ By Schur complement we have the following $$tI-(Q-Q_N)^T(Q-Q_N)\succeq 0$$ If $Q\in \mathbb{R}$ , the above becomes $$t-\|Q-Q_N\|^2\geq 0 \Rightarrow t\geq \|Q-Q_N\|^2 \geq 0$$ So the original problem is equivalent to \begin{align}
&\min_{t,Q} & &t \\
& s.t. & & \|Q-Q_N\|^2 \geq 0
\end{align} or \begin{align}
&\min_{t,Q} & &t \\
& s.t. & & \mathcal{A}(t,Q)\succeq 0
\end{align} The second formulation is a SDP My question is: if $Q\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ how to obtain the above convex optimization problem (minimize over $t$ ) with $\|\cdot\|^2$ replaced by $\|\cdot\|_F^2$ Is there any method except the vectorization of matrices ?","['matrices', 'normed-spaces', 'linear-matrix-inequality', 'convex-optimization', 'schur-complement']"

2184444,Why does Pascal's Triangle (mod 2) encode the Fermat primes?,"I've just finished the recent Numberphile video on Pascal's Triangle and learned about a new-to-me property of the triangle; the Fermat primes $F_0 = 3, F_1 = 5, F_2 = 17, \dots$ are encoded in it somehow! Take the standard Pascal's Triangle $(\mod 2)$ and read out each row $r_n$ as binary, $x_n = \sum_{i=0}^n 2^{i}r_{n,i}$ then the first few rows read as 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 51, 85, 255, 257, … These are either Fermat primes or products of Fermat primes! I wrote a short Python Script to explore a bit. The first few rows present an elegant binary pattern, $x_n = \prod_{i=0}^n F_{i}^{r_{n,i}}$ selecting $3, 5, 3 \times 5, 17, 3 \times 17$, etc. This pattern is striking in its precision. I wanted to know what happens around row 32/33, when we reach the Fermat non-prime $F_5 = 2^{2^5}+1 = 4294967297 = 641 \times 6700417$. The pattern breaks, and $F_5$ shows up. However, on the next few rows, we have $12884901891 = 3 \times 641 \times 6700417, 21474836485 = 5 \times 641 \times 6700417, \dots$ So this means that Fermat numbers specifically, rather than just some certain primes, are part of this overall correspondence. Additionally, we can see that the binary pattern repeats here, and it goes through all of the same permutations as earlier, but with the two new factors from $F_5$. $F_6$ also adds two more factors and repeats the pattern. I haven't yet explored higher. I would like to know why this correspondence exists and what it might tell us about Fermat numbers. Personally, I found this jaw-dropping.","['combinatorics', 'binomial-coefficients']"

$ I met this kind of definition when I was dealing with change of variables for  some kind parametrization of the characters of a representation. In particular they used the $\mathfrak{SU}(3)_{\mathbb{C}}$ Cartan matrix as the previous $A$ matrix in such a way they can change the variables for a given representation in variables in the representation of the Cartan matrix. Is this something that I can find in any book? I tried on google but I think that it is not called star product, or anyway it is something so specific that I could not be able to find any proper definition. Last question: If this kind of change of variables makes sense, is it possible to make it in such a way it is not invertible? I can explain: if I have some variables in a representation, for instance $x_1,x_2,x_3$, it is possible to find a not square matrix in such a way the they can be expressed as one variable $z$? I think that I can reformulate: there are not square Cartan matrices?","['representation-theory', 'group-theory', 'lie-algebras', 'lie-groups']"
2184465,Composition of functions question,"Am restricting this question to the elementary context of Riemann integrals and continuous functions $f,g.$ Because this came up in the context of another question, I would prefer to keep the examples from that question, at the risk of artificiality. Let $g:[0,4]\to \mathbb{R}$  such that $$\int_0^1g(x)dx = \int_3^4 4-g(x)dx.~~~~~(1)$$ An example would be $g(x) = x(x-3)^2.$ It is I think not true in general that the above implies $$\int_0^1 f(g(x))dx = \int_3^4 f(4- g(x))dx ~~~~~(2)$$ however the equality happens to hold with this $g(x).$ My attempt to justify the implication ran as follows. Using an arbitrarily fine Riemann sum approximation of the L.H.S. integral in (1) we get an arbitrarily close approximation to the integral. Using the same process for the R.H.S we (at least in this special case, which is part of my assumptions) have a rearrangement of summands, hence the same approximation. Regarded as a sum of (say) rectangles on subintervals of $[0,1],$ it seems that we may apply $f$ to the approximation of $g$ in each subinterval and get a Riemann sum for the L.H.S. of (2). Since on the R.H.S. of (2) we are applying $f$ to the same summands (up to rearrangement) it would seem that as the subintervals shrink the equality in (2) should follow. My question is, where is the flaw in this naive reasoning, if there is one? Are there additional assumptions that would make the implication true?","['inverse-function', 'calculus', 'functions', 'integration', 'definite-integrals']"
2184505,"Why ellipse is a ""conic"" section?","When I was first introduced to conic sections, I was kinda surprised that the ellipse is one of them. I mean intuitively, if a cone is cut by a slant surface, one would expect that the cross-section is an egg-shaped one; since the flat circular sections become wider the more we go down. It is still strange for me that why the cross-section of a cone and a slant surface becomes a symmetric ellipse and not an egg-shaped one. Can anyone explain this in an intuitive way?

You are summing over the total number of pairs of scores.

2184693,Prove that $a * b = a + b - ab$ defines a group operation on $\Bbb R \setminus \{1\}$,"So, basically I'm taking an intro into proofs class, and we're given homework to prove something in abstract algebra. Being one that hasn't yet taken an abstract algebra course I really don't know if what I'm doing is correct here.

  $$a * b = a + b - ab, \quad \forall  \,\, a,b \in \mathbb{R} \backslash \left\{ 1 \right\} .$$ My proof structure: After reading about abstract algebra for a while, it looks like what I need to show is that if this set is a group, it has to satisfy associativity with the operation, and the existence of an identity and inverse element. So what I did was that I assumed that there exists an element in the set $\mathbb{R} \backslash \left\{ 1 \right\}$ such that it satisfies the identity property for the set and another element that satisfies the inverse property for all the elements in the set. However I'm having trouble trying to show that the operation is indeed associative through algebra since $$\begin{align}
a(b * c) & = a(b+c) - abc \\
& \ne (a+b)c - abc = (a*b)c \\
\end{align}$$ So in short, I want to ask if it's correct to assume that an element for the set exists that would satisfy the identity and inverse property for the group.

I'm not actually interested in how to show this as it is straightforward once the definition of 'generated' is clear, but it rather confused me. I figured that $S$ generating $A$ as an algebra means that every $f\in A$ can be written as $\sum_{i = 1}^n g_i h_i$, where $g_i\in S$ and $h_i\in K[x_1, ..., x_n]$, just like one would generate a module. This did not yield a proof after some work, so I figured my definition must be wrong but Googling didn't provide any alternatives. I then looked at the solution. Kemper says this: ""That $S$ generates $A$ means that for every element $f\in A$ there exist finitely many elements $f_1, ..., f_m \in S$ and a polynomial $F\in K[T_1, ..., T_m]$ in $m$ indeterminates such that $f = F(f_1, ..., f_m)$.

2185272,Function $f(x)$ such that $\frac{f'(x) \cdot x}{f(x)}$ is linear,"I've just learnt about price elasticity of demand. Since we're only doing 10th grade economics, our teacher tried to make it simple by using an example where the demand curve is linear (i.e. quantity of demand is in linear relationship with the price), and we were supposed to treat the price elasticity of demand $e_d$ as having a linear relationship with the price (but it is not ). However, as the teacher pointed out to a few curious students, $e_d$ is in fact not having such a linear relationship at all, as seen in its formula: \begin{align}
e_d = \frac{\text{variation in demand}}{\text{variation in price}}
= \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}

where $Q$ stands for quantity of demand and $P$ stands for price, and $\Delta Q$ and $\Delta P$ respectively stand for change in demand and price. I then wanted to find a case where $e_d$ is actually linear. By assuming the demand $q$ for a certain price $p$ is given by a function $q = f(p)$, I could express the price elasticity at that price $p$ as \begin{align}
e_d = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \times \frac{x}{f(x)} 
= \frac{f'(x)x}{f(x)}
\end{align} This where I got stuck. My limited knowledge in calculus and in mathematics in general does not give an explicit way to find a $f(x)$ that makes $e_d$ a linear equation, i.e. $\frac{f'(x) \cdot x}{f(x)} = ax + c$, where $a$ and $c$ are real numbers.

Essentially, in the partition problem, the goal is to partition a multiset of integers M into two subsets, $S_1 $and $S_2$, such that $\sum_{e \in S_1} e = \sum_{e \in S_2} e$. Of course, not all multisets can do this $\{2, 5\}$ for example, and some have more than one unique solution, eg $\{1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3\}$. Is it mathematically correct to say that partitioning $M + M$ into subsets $S_i$ for $i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, that is to say duplicating the elements in $M$ and doubling the subsets to partition, will result in four subsets of equal sum, iff the original set could be 2-partitioned?

However, when I was given a simple differential equation to solve: $2xy\frac{dy}{dx} = 4x^2 + 3y^2$ I was able to compute the correct answer much faster and efficiently when $v=\frac{y}{x}$ but struggled to do so with $v=\frac{x}{y}$.

2186275,Help an geographer define an equation!,"I'm a physical geographer and I'm working on a piece of research where I have some broad physical relationships which I want to try and put into an equation - i.e. I want to define an empirical equation which describes the phenomena I've observed. I'm way out of my depth in formulating equations so I'm hoping someone here can help. I have a suspicion this is not a hugely complex problem for anyone who knows maths! It's probably not relevant to the question, but it's all about how the physical properties of peat bogs alter how their water content changes over time, and then how that water content, coupled with their density, affects wildfire risk. For a given point in time, and a given location I'll have a volumetric water content $V_x$. (So I I'll have a lots of these values for different times and locations) For each location I'll have a normally distributed bulk density $pb$, for which I know the mean and standard deviation. If the volumetric water content is multiplied by bulk density it gives gravimetic water content $U_x$. (So for any given $V_x$ and I'd have a bunch of values for $U_x$, which I think would be a probability distribution?) Gravimetric water content determines wildfire susceptibility (drier is more susceptible). It makes sense to define 2 thresholds: $U^*$, below which burning is almost certain, and $U_w$ above which burning is unlikely. I'd like to define this as probability of burning with 1 (or near 1) at $U^*$ and a probability of $~0.1$ to $0.2$ at $U_w$. Between these values the relationship would not be linear but would be a curve which drops off with increasing U. Ideally (as we're still trying to get a handle on this) there would be an adjustable factor for exactly how quickly this drops off with increasing $U$ approaching $U_w$. So what I'd like to do is take a probability distribution of $U$ (based on the $V_x$ and the distribution of pb values). And then multiple this by the probability of burning relationship so I can say; given a volumetric water content, and given the bulk density distribution, $K$ is the probability of wildfire burning. As I said, I'm just not good enough with maths to put all these things together into an equation! The ultimate idea is to propose this empirical equation which then I and other researcher can test. Thanks in advance for any help you can give in helping me define this.","['statistics', 'integration', 'calculus']"
2186279,"When reasoning about symmetries of a geometrical figure, are we implicitly assuming a ""fixed point of view""?","Although the concept of ""symmetry"" is quite intuitive, I'm finding it difficult to pin down exactly what one means by the ""symmetries of the equilateral triangle"". Here's an example. Suppose I have an equilateral triangle $ABC$. One of its particular symmetry is rotation around its center by $120$ degrees, which results in the same triangle, but with its vertices interchanged: But here is where it gets ""fuzzy"" (for me). If our ""reference frame"", or ""point of view"" also rotates by $120$ degrees, then what we'll see is the first triangle, and the rotation would have had no effect. So in talking about symmetries of geometric figures, aren't we implicitly assuming that we have to stay put, and not shift our viewpoint? I'm hope I'm making sense here. To formalise the concept of ""fixing our viewpoint"", we label the vertices of our triangle, and say that ""rotation by $120$ degrees"" simply means the abstract map $\begin{pmatrix}A&B&C\\B&C&A\end{pmatrix}$. Or we could argue that it's the map of the plane $f: \mathbf{R}^{2} \to \mathbf{R}^{2}$, which preserves the properties of the equilateral triangle, but again, what we're really doing is converting the vertices to numbers, and composing maps between these numbers. In my mind, these are more precise statements, because we can write them down, compose the symmetries, construct the Cayley table, etc., but the intuitive processes of ""rotate around center"", ""reflect in the middle"", and ""translate by a few units"" seem like ghosts of our intuition. There's not much we can do with them. If we don't put labels on the triangle, there's no way to reason about its symmetries. It has no distinguishing features. For example, if we don't label the plane with real numbers to make it $\mathbf{R}^{2}$, we can't talk about the plane rotating, reflecting, shearing, expanding, etc., because it will look the same no matter what we do to it. No point of the plane is prioritised over the other. So am I right in saying that thinking about symmetries of geometrical objects is purely for motivation, but when it boils down to the rigorous study of groups, we study, say, abstract permutations of a set of letters $\{A,B,C \}$? In this case, the problem I posed vanishes. But my confusion might just stem from a huge, but simple, misunderstanding.","['symmetry', 'geometry']"

First of all, since X and Y are independent, can I split it up so that it becomes $E(X)\cdot E(e^{X-Y})?$ Furthermore, if it was just $e^X$ for instance, then I would just use the probability distribution function for $X$ and calculate $P_1e^{X_1} + P_2e^{X_2} + \ldots + P_ne^{X_n}$.

Show that there always exist two matrices $B',C'$ which satisfy the following conditions: a) $A'=B'C'$ b) $||B'-B||$ and $||C'-C||$ can be upper-bounded by $\epsilon$ and other constant terms. The second condition implies that $B'$ and $C'$ can be chosen to be sufficiently close to $B$ and $C$ as long as $A'$ is sufficiently close to $A.$ Moreover, note that there is no constraint on $B$ and $C$, except that $k\geq\min(m,n).$ Intuitively i think it should be possible but i cannot prove/disprove it.
