882877,Produce unique number given two integers,"Given two integers, $a$ and $b$, I need an operation to produce a third number $c$. This number does not have to be an integer. The restrictions are as follows: $c$ must be unique for the inputs (but it does not have to be reversible). $a$ and $b$ must be interchangeable ($a$ & $b$ = $b$ & $a$) Initially, the first thing I thought of was simply $a+b$, however naturally that does not fit restriction 1. Then I considered a hash function of some sort, but that doesn't fit 2. Any thoughts?","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions']"
882880,"For an inductive limit $X = \bigcup X_n$ of vector spaces, show that $X$ is complete if $X_n$ is complete for all $n$","Let $X$ be a vector space. Suppose that $\{X_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence of vector subspaces such that $X_n \subseteq X_{n+1}$ for all $n$, Each $X_n$ is a locally convex topological vector space, and the topology on $X_n$ coincides exactly with the subspace topology that it inherits for $X_{n+1}$. Then we can definie the so-called inductive limit topology on $X$, which is the strongest locally convex, topological vector space topology for which the injections $X_n \to X$ are all continuous. I would like to prove that if $X_n$ is complete for all $n$, then $X$ is complete. This fact is stated in Reed and Simon's Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics, Vol.1 . Reed and Simon give a reference for the proof: A. and W. Robertson's Topological Vector Spaces . Unfortunately, this text is not available at my University library. Here's what I have so far. Suppose that $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is Cauchy in $X$. First of all, consider the case when there exists some index $N$ so that $X_N \cap \{x_n\}$ is infinite. Then we can choose some subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}_{k=1}^\infty$ so that$\{x_{n_k}\} \subseteq X_N$. Next, Let $U$ be an arbitrary balanced, convex, basis-neighborhood of $0$ in $X_N$. Using this lemma, it is possible to lift $U$ to a balanced, convex neighborhood $\tilde{U}$ of $0$ in $X$, with the property that $X_N \cap\tilde{U} = U$. Because $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy in $X$, there is an $M \in \mathbb{N}$ so that $$n,m \ge M \implies x_n -x_m \in \tilde{U}.$$ This in turn implies that $$k,j \ge M \implies x_{n_k} -x_{n_j} \in \tilde{U} \cap X_N = U.$$ Therefore $\{x_{n_k}\}$ is Cauchy in $X_N$. By the completeness of $X_N$, there exists some $x \in X_n$ so that $x_{n_k} \to x$. To finish this case, we notice that: $$x_n - x = (x_n - x_{n_k}) + (x_{n_k} - x)$$ So if $n$ and $k$ are made large enough, $x_n - x$ will reside inside any neighborhood $U$ of $0$ (to make this last step totally clear, we do need to recall the fact that, within any open any $V$ containing zero in $X$, we can find an open neighborhood $\tilde{V}$ of $0$ so that $\tilde{V} +\tilde{V} \subseteq V$). I'm not sure how to complete the proof in the case where $\{x_n\} \cap X_N$ is finite for all $N$. In that case, I'm not able to extract the subsequence $x_{n_k}$, which was the key to the proof above. Hints or solutions are greatly appreciated.","['topological-vector-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
882905,Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) constructed by the summation of positive-definite kernels.,"Let $k_1,\ldots,k_p$ be positive definite kernels defined on $\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is a non-empty set. $k_i$ is the reproducing kernel of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) $\mathcal{H}_i$, which is endowed with an inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_{\mathcal{H}_i}$, from which the norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert_{\mathcal{H}_i}$ is induced ($i=1,\ldots,p$). Now let $k$ be a real-valued function defined on $\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}$, with $k=\sum_{i=1}^{p}k_i$. It is straightforward to prove (isn't it?) that $k$ is positive definite, since positive-definiteness is preserved under summation. Apparently, there corresponds a RKHS, $\mathcal{H}$ to $k$, with inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}$ and norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert_{\mathcal{H}}$. What is the relation between the norm of $\mathcal{H}$ and the norms of $\mathcal{H}_i$, $i=1,\ldots,p$? Do we need to require that the spaces $\mathcal{H}_i$ are pairwise-perpendicular so that it holds $$
\lVert\cdot\rVert_{\mathcal{H}}^2
= 
\sum_{i=1}^{p}\lVert\cdot\rVert_{\mathcal{H}_i}^2,
$$ and, if so, what that would mean for the reproducing kernels $k_i$? Moreover: Let $f\in\mathcal{H}$, how could its norm, $\lVert f \rVert_{\mathcal{H}}$, be expressed in terms of the norms of the spaces $\mathcal{H}_i$? The above questions may seem vague, or even incorrect in the way they are stated. Please feel free to suggest approaches and/or corrections (for instance, should the title be changed?), if necessary.

882939,Proving that a Sturm-Liouville problem is in the limit-point/-circle case,"I would like to understand techniques anybody is able to detail to me on how one may actually prove that a particular Sturm-Liouville (S-L) problem, i.e., of the form
\begin{equation}
L[y](x):=-\frac{d}{dx}\big(p(x)\frac{dy}{dx}\big)+q(x)y(x)=\lambda w(x)y(x)
\end{equation}
on the interval $[0,\infty)$ and with boundary condition of the form $y(0)\cos(\alpha)-(py')(0)\sin(\alpha)=0$, is in the limit-point (l.p.) or limit-circle (l.c.) case at $\infty$. For example, if $p(x)=w(x)=1/(x+1)=1/q(x)$ and $\alpha=0$, how might one set about proving that $L$ is l.p. or l.c.? I have tried considering the following: suppose $\{u,v\}$ is a fundamental system for $L[y]=\lambda y$ on $[0,\infty)$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
u(0)=(pv')(0)=\cos(\alpha), (pu')(0)=-v(0)=-\sin(\alpha),
\end{equation}
so that for any $b>0$, $0\leq\beta<2\pi$ and $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}\backslash\mathbb{R}$ there is unique $m=m_{b,\beta}(\lambda)\in\mathbb{C}$ such that $y=u+mv$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
y(b)\cos(\beta)-(py')(b)\sin(\beta)=0.
\end{equation}
Then $m$ is on a circle of radius $(2$Im$\lambda\int_0^bw|v|^2)^{-1}$; if in the limit $b\rightarrow\infty$ this radius becomes $0$ then we are in l.p., and if it has non-zero limit then we are in l.c.. So the relevant behaviour of the S-L problem is governed by whether or not this solution $v$ is globally in the weighted space $L^2(0,\infty;w)$. However I have no idea how to use the structure of such a particular S-L problem as that given above, to determine how this $v$ behaves. Does anybody have any ideas? Should I try to calculate exactly what the solution $v$ is, or can I simply use some trick just to determine its (non-)global square integrability? Or is there indeed a completely alternative way to proceed regarding this?

882943,"Ricci Tensor, Curvature and Scalar Curvature computation from definition","I am studying a little of Riemannian geometry and I am having some problem in making the connection between two expressions of Ricci tensor, curvature and scalar curvature.
Well, in the book that I am studying I find that: Let $L_{X,Y} : T_xM \to T_xM$, we define the Ricci tensor like: $$Q'(X,Y) = \operatorname{trace} L_{X,Y}.$$ Where $L_{X,Y} = R(\cdot,X)Y$, where $R(Z,X)Y$  is the Riemann tensor. Thats way, we define the Ricci curvature as $\operatorname{Ricci}(X) = Q'(X,X)$. So, if we define $$Q(X) = \sum_i R(X,\partial_i)\partial_i$$ where $\{\partial_i\}$ is one orthonormal basis, it is easy to verify that $$Q'(X,Y) = \langle Q(X), Y \rangle,$$ for any $X,Y \in T_xM$. In particular, if we use $X = \partial_j$ and compute $$Q'(X,X) = \operatorname{Ricci}(X) = \sum_i K(\partial_j, \partial_i),$$ that is, the sum of all secctional curvatures,
it is easy to see that if we denote $S$ the scalar curvature as $S = \operatorname{trace} Q(X)$, we find that $$S = \sum_i \operatorname{Ricci}(\partial_i).$$ My question is, how do I obtain the expression using Christoffel symbols from these definitions? What is the connection between these expressions and the expression in coordinates? Thanks a lot for the help. Cordially, Leonardo","['riemannian-geometry', 'curvature', 'differential-geometry']"

I know for sure that $p_1 = \dfrac{3}{2}$. If my approach above is correct, I'll let this question rest.

883165,Why generalize the derivative for multivariable functions? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Derivative of function with 2 variables (3 answers) Closed 9 years ago . Sorry if this is a dupe (did a search, couldn't find anything). In single variable calculus, if the following limit exists: $$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h},$$ then this expression itself is the derivative of $f$ at $x$. This is nicely motivated geometrically and otherwise. This definition gives of $f'(x)$ which gives the best linear approximation $\tilde{f}$ to $f$ at $x$ by $$\tilde{f}(t) = f'(x)t + f(x).$$ For functions of several variables, most of the time I see the derivative defined in terms of the best linear approximation to the function explicitly. Specifically, the derivative of a multivariable function $g$ at $\mathbf{y}$ is some linear operator $L(\mathbf{y})$. Concretely, if the following expression is satisfied: $$\lim_{\mathbf{h} \rightarrow 0}\frac{\|g(\mathbf{y} + \mathbf{h}) - g(\mathbf{y}) + L(\mathbf{y})\|}{\|\mathbf{h}\|} = 0,$$ then $L(\mathbf{y})$ is the derivative of $g$ at $\mathbf{y}$. We can show that $L(\mathbf{y})$ is unique in this case. My question is why is this generalization necessary? What is the problem with simply defining is analogously to the single variable case as $$L(\mathbf{y}) = \lim_{\mathbf{h} \rightarrow 0}\frac{g(\mathbf{y} + \mathbf{h}) - g(\mathbf{y})}{\|\mathbf{h}\|}?$$","['multivariable-calculus', 'linear-algebra', 'derivatives']"

So, for example: $[\overline{1}]=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\dots=\infty\;$ is the harmonic series $[\overline{1,-1}]=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{-1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\dots=\ln2\;$ is well known $[\overline{1,1,-2}]=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{-2}{3}+\dots=\ln3\;$ is slightly less well known (I think) $[\overline{1,0,-1,0}]=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{0}{2}+\frac{-1}{3}+\dots=\frac{\pi}{4}\;$ is the Gregory-Leibniz series for $\pi$ What I claim is that $[\overline{1,-1,-2,-1,1,2}]$ is equal to $0$. I wonder if there are any simple proofs of this (i.e. definitely without using calculus, preferably without appealing to complex numbers/taylor series/etc.) P.S. I know a method that doesn't use any integrals or derivatives, but requires knowledge of the taylor series for $\ln(x)$ and the Euler formula for $e^{ix}$. The reason I believe that there should be an elementary proof is that the sum, $0$, is a very simple number.",['sequences-and-series']
883236,Finding points where a smooth map between differential manifolds is or is not an immersion.,"I am having trouble answering questions pertaining to immersions on smooth manifolds.  For example:  Given the unit sphere $S^2$ around the origin in $R^3$ and the map $f: S^2 \rightarrow R^3$ given by $f(x,y,z) =(yz,zx,xy), show f fails to be an immersion at 6 points. I am working on problems from a qualifying exam in topology and I am looking for a generic way to approach these types of problems. My ideas so far:
I know that an immersion at a point x in $S^2$ means that the derivative map $df_x$ is injective from the tangent space at that point in $S^2$ to the tangent space of f(x) in $R^3$. 1)  Use stereographic projection and then consider the composition with this map giving us a map from $R^2$ to $R^3$.  This approach seems to be really ugly sometimes and if I replace $S^2$ with a hyperboloid or some other surface I may not have a map like stereographic projection. 2)  Consider only hemispheres at a time and solve for one variable.  In this case I would start by considering the top hemisphere and solve for z, getting $z = \sqrt{-x^2 -y^2 + 1}$ .  Then the $df_x$ map would just be the Jacobian of f with the above relation plugged in for z.  I can thus consider the rank of this map at different points to see if I have an immersion.  This method again gets pretty ugly and I am not even sure if it is correct. 3)  The method I prefer but seem to get the opposite answer with is to consider the sphere as a level curve at 1 of the function $F(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.  Then to solve this problem I consider the 3x3 matrix for $df_x$.  If it is rank 3 then f is an immersion as it will take the tangent space at any point on the sphere to a two dimensional subspace of $R^3$.  If it is rank 2 then we need to show that the tangent space at a point is sent to a two dimensional space under $df_x$.  One way I believe we can do this is to consider the normal vector (gradient of F) to this tangent plane and see what happens to it under $df_x$. IF the normal vector is in the kernel of $df_x$ then is it true that the tangent space is preserved?  Trying this method I got the answer that the points $(\pm 1, 0,0), (0, \pm1,0), (0,0, \pm1)$ ARE points at which we have an immersion and every other point on the great circles (z=0, x=0,y=0) are NOT immersions.  I know this is possible as an answer but seems to be the opposite of what the question asks. If anybody can give me any ideas on which method here works or any other generic method to do these problems I would be very appreciative.  Thanks. Also this is my first question posted here so please let me know of any positing errors or anything I might have messed up.","['general-topology', 'differential']"

883764,"Example for divisors, line bundles and meromorphic functions on $\mathbb{CP}^2$","I have been studying divisors using Griffiths/Harris (chapter 1.1) as well as Huybrechts (chapter 2.3). However, I cannot seem to find any very easy worked examples - i.e. $\mathbb{CP}^1$ or $\mathbb{CP}^2$ to complement the discussion there. So I tried to work things out for the latter of these myself. Maybe someone could point me at a decent source for examples or tell me whether my very pedestrian calculations make any sense. Thanks in advance. 1) Some notation. Consider $\mathbb{CP}^2 \subset \mathbb{C}^3$. For $z_i \in \mathbb{C}^3$ a point in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ is given by $(z_1: z_2: z_3) \sim (\lambda z_1:\lambda z_2:\lambda_3)$. An open covering is given by $U_i = \{(z_1:z_2:z_3) \vert z_i \neq 0\}$. Furthermore there are maps $\phi_1 : U_1 \to \mathbb{C}^2$, $(z_1:z_2:z_3) \mapsto (z_2/z_1, z_3/z_1) \equiv (w^{(1)}_1, w^{(1)}_2) \in \mathbb{C}^2$. We define maps $\phi_{2,3}$ and coordinates $w^{(2,3)}_j$ identically. I.e. the $w^{(i)}_j$ are coordinates in a patch $U_i$. On $U_i \cap U_j$ we can consider $\phi_{ij} \equiv \phi_i \circ \phi_j^{-1}$. 2) With this out of the way, consider the divisor $D_1$ defined (globally) by $\{ z_1 = 0\}$. In other words, on $U_2$, $D_1$ is defined by $w^{(2)}_1 = 0$, on $U_3$ by $w^{(3)}_1 = 0$. Now, we want to link this to a (global) section of $\mathcal{M}^* / \mathcal{O}^*$ where $\mathcal{M}^*$ is the sheaf of not identically zero meromorphic functions and $\mathcal{O}^*$ is the sheaf of non-zero holomorphic functions. On $U_{2}$ and $U_{3}$, $D_1$ is locally defined by the zeros of the functions $g_{2} \equiv w^{(2)}_1, g_{3} \equiv w^{(3)}_1$. Since $D_1 \cap U_1 = \emptyset$, we can pick $g_1 = 1$. Direct calculation shows that on the overlaps $U_i \cap U_j$ the quotients $\frac{g_i}{g_j} \in \mathcal{O}^*(U_i \cap U_j)$ and thus we have constructed our global section. 3) The next step is to construct the associated line bundle $[ D_1 ]$. Since $g_{ij} \equiv \frac{g_i}{g_j} \in \mathcal{O}^*(U_i \cap U_j)$, the $g_{ij}$ define transition functions / cocycles for a line bundle on $\mathbb{CP}^2$. 4) Finally we construct a global section of $\mathcal{O}(D_1)$. To do so we consider a generic polynomial in the patch $U_1$, $\sigma_1 = \sum_{i,j \geq 0} a_{ij} (w_1^{(1)})^i (w_2^{(1)})^j$ (where $\sigma_1 = \sigma \vert_{U_1}$ for a hypothetical global section $\sigma$). Using both the transition functions $g_{ij}$ as well as the earlier $\phi_{ij} = \phi_i \circ \phi_j^{-1}$ one finds that
$$
\sigma_2 = w_1^{(2)} \sum_{i,j \geq 0} a_{ij} \left( \frac{1}{w^{(2)}_1} \right)^i \left( \frac{w^{(2)}_2}{w^{(2)}_1} \right)^j.
$$
A similar result for $\sigma_3$ restricts the $a_{ij}$ such that a global holomorphic section is defined by
$$
\sigma_1 = a_{00} + a_{10} w^{(1)}_1 + a_{01} w^{(1)}_2
$$
and similar in the other patches. 5) There is a simple generalisation to $n D_1$ as well as $D_{2,3}$. In the former case we have to garnish a number of expressions with exponentials ${}^n$. 6) Question: How does the torus $T^2$ action on $\mathbb{CP}^2$ act on the various line bundles $n D_i$?","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

884011,A function is real-differentiable iff it has a complex-differentiable extension,"Is this conjecture true?

The reverse implication is trivial; a complex differentiable function $g$ is real differentiable on $A$, and since differentiability is local and $f$ and $g$ agree on $A$, $f$ is real differentiable as well. But the forward implication is probably too strong to be true, although I can't think of any counterexamples. Is it true if $g$ is only required to be complex differentiable at $a$? If we only require $f-g\in o(x-a)$, then the statement can be satisfied by letting $g(z)=f(a)+f'(a)(z-a)$.

The stable manifold theorem (together with the implicit function theorem, I think) yields that there exists a function which describes all orbits near the fixed point. 1- Is all this correct? I am trying to be exhaustive and solve examples of all possibles such cases, that is with different kind of hyperbolic points. For the following cases, it has been straightforward: [both strictly positive (negative) eigenvalues], [one eigenvalue strictly positive, one eigenvalue strictly negative], [equal real non-zero eigenvalues]. The remaining cases involve complex (conjugate) eigenvalues, where I am stuck. 2- When I observe a stability diagram (in the phase plane) of a hyperbolic saddle point for example, the ""shape"" of the stable manifold appears to be quite obvious. For the complex cases, the theorem states that the stable manifold is of dimension 2, but I can hardly understand this: what does it look like? This question also hold for the linear case and the stable subspace. 3- It does not seem possible to write the equations in the form of the first equation of the post for complex (non-real) eigenvalues, since either $B_i$ are not real, either, when written as a real Jacobian block, both $x$ and $y$ appears in both lines. The question, closely related to question 2, is: how can the stable manifold be calculated when the eigenvalues are (non-real) complex? Edit 4- Additional question: why is it that the vector spaces in which $x$ and $y$ live have to coincide with the dimension of the stable and respectively unstable eigenspaces? Edit: answer to question 4 : the question seems to be not very clear. I was wondering why in the first equation the number of $B_1$ lines had to coincide with the dimension of the stable manifold, and why the number of lines of $B_2$ had to be the dimension of the instable manifold. I now understood that this is not necessary. It is commonly done because people are usually looking for the equation of the stable manifold so seek it as a curve $(x,s(x))$. But any invariant manifold can be calculated by splitting $X$ in another way, therefore changing the dimensions of $B_1$ and $B_2$.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'complex-dynamics']"

The only information that we can use as input is the width and height of the rectangle, and the required output would be the center point of the circle and the radius. The image below shows an example - the input box, and the output circle. I could write a brute force method to solve this, but I'd like something more elegant. I have found many sites which have answers like this that use a parabolic formula with width and height, but in this case the height (of the arc) is not definite- if, for example, the rectangle were very tall, the arc would only use space at the bottom of the rect. If the rectangle were perfectly square, or the height of the rect was larger than the width, the formula would be easy- (using a coordinate system where 0,0 is the bottom left corner) circle.centerPoint = (rect.width / 2, 0); circle.radius = (rect.width / 2); But as the rect gets longer, the center point needs to drop and the radius needs to get larger.

This in-equivalence is represented geometrically by the vanishing of the diameter of the latter unit ball ""in the limit,"" though that is really nothing more than a rephrasing of the definition of the equivalence of norms. I guess one could rephrase my question in the following way: what geometric difference between unit balls arise in infinite dimensional normed vector spaces that are not apparent (from the perspective of norm equivalence) in the finite case? Are there factors other than the decay of the norm of an arbitrary sequence points on the sphere?

884364,"Two dice thrown, one comes up 6","If my friend throws two dice, and covers them up, but I see that one of them was a 6, what's the probability that they were both 6s given this knowledge? I'm under the impression that the answer is 2/7, because the other die could be any of the other numbers, but if he really did roll double sixes you could have seen either one, so there are two ways for that to happen. That makes seven equally likely possibilities: (6*,1) (6*,2) (6*,3) (6*,4) (6*,5) (6*,6) and (6,6*), where * represents the one you saw. My question is whether the answer should really be 2/12 = 1/6 since you might think you ought to count the cases (1,6*) (2,6*) etc. as separate---that is, the case in which the other die comes up as a 6 and you see it. You could distinguish the dice by painting one red, for example. I hope the question is well posed. Let me know if you think it should be clarified. EDIT: Thanks for the speedy responses everyone. One way I thought about the question is that instead of the 36 outcomes we typically think of for two dice, there are now 72 possible outcomes---for each roll there are two events corresponding to seeing die A or die B. In this case when we condition on the fact that we saw one of the dice to be a 6 we've restricted our sample space in the way I've described above. For clarity, this means we now have the following possibilities: (6*,6) (6,6*) (6*,5) (6*,4) (6*,3) (6*,2) (6*,1) I'm not sure whether to include the remaining possibilities or not: (1,6*) (2,6*) (3,6*) (4,6*) (5,6*) Clearly the answer depends highly on the interpretation of the wording of the question. I'm interpreting it to mean you're equally likely to spot one die or the other. I'm fairly sure this situation is different than being given the information that at least one of the dice is a six. Can anyone convince me why this isn't a legitimate way to interpret the question, or otherwise she'd some light on which restricted sample space is the correct one?

I've read a proof of the statement :""An infinite subset of $\mathbb N$ is countable; that is, if $A \subset \mathbb N$ and if $A$ is infinite, then $A$ is equivalent to $\mathbb N$ ."" in Carothers' textbook and there is one part of the proof I don't understand. Proof Recall that $\mathbb N$ is well ordered. That is, each nonempty subset of $\mathbb N$ has a smallest element. Thus, since $A \ne \emptyset$ , there is a smallest element $x_1 \in A$ . Then $A \setminus \{x_1\} \ne \emptyset$ , and there must be a smallest $x_2 \in A \setminus \{x_1\}$ . But now $A \setminus \{x_1,x_2\} \ne \emptyset$ , and so we continue, setting $x_3=\min(A \setminus \{x_1,x_2\})$ . By induction, we can find $x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n,... \in A$ , where $x_n=\min(A \setminus \{x_1,...,x_{n-1}\})$ . How do we know that this process exhausts $A$ ? Well, suppose that $x \in A \setminus \{x_1,x_2,...\} \ne \emptyset$ . Then the set $\{k : x_k>x\}$ must be nonempty (otherwise we would have $x \in A$ and $x<x_1=\min A$ ) , and hence it has a least element. That is, there is some $n$ with $x_1<...<x_{n-1}<x<x_n$ . But this contradicts the choice of $x_n$ as the first element in $A \setminus \{x_1,...,x_{n-1}\}$ . Consequently, $A$ is countable. My questions It is affirmed that the set $\{k : x_k>x\}$ can't be empty (I don't get the reason Carothers gives for this being impossible). As I see it, if $\{k : x_k>x\}$ is empty, then $x_k \leq x$ for all $k$ . So the set $\{x_1,x_2,...\}$ obtained by the method of extracting the smallest element from each remaining nonempty subset of $\mathbb N$ is finite, but we've seen that the set constructed from choosing $x_n=\min(A \setminus \{x_1,...,x_{n-1}\})$ is infinite. So, wouldn't this be the reason why the set $\{k : x_k>x\}$ can't be empty rather than ""otherwise we would have $x \in A$ and $x<x_1=\min A$ ""?. I couldn't even understand why would $x$ be in $A$ instead of $x \in A \setminus \{x_1,x_2,...\}$ or why $x<x_1$ . I know it is a very small part of the proof but I would like to understand all the steps of it so I would appreciate if someone could clear up my doubt.","['natural-numbers', 'elementary-set-theory']"

$I\mathcal O_{K'}$ becomes a principal ideal in $\mathcal O_{K'}$. The example solution for this problem uses $K' = K[X]/(X^h - x)$ where $(x) = I^h$
and $h$ is the class number for the field $K$. I see why $I\mathcal O_{K'}$ is a principal ideal, however what I fail to see is why $K'$ is a field.

In order to use that result, one need to know that the sheaf $f^{-1}I \cdot \mathcal{O}_X$ is an invertible sheaf on $X$. However, I don't know how to show that fact.","['blowup', 'algebraic-geometry', 'birational-geometry']"

The distinction between vector space $\Bbb{R}^2$ and affine space $A\Bbb{R}^2$ lies in the fact that in $\Bbb{R}^2$ the point (0,0) has a special significance ( it is the additive identity) and the addition of two vectors in $\Bbb{R}^2$ makes sense.
