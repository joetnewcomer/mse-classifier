2094744,Proving that some subset of $ \mathbb{H}^{2} \times \mathbb{H}^{2} $ is connected.,"Since we know that the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H^{2}}$ is metric space with metric $ d_{H}(z,w) = 2 \tanh^{-1} \frac{ \mid z - w \mid}{ \mid z - \overline{w} \mid }$, where $ z, w \in \mathbb{H^{2}}$. Now we define the distance function on $\mathbb{H^{2}} \times \mathbb{H^{2}} $ given by
$$ \gamma(z,w) = (  (d_{H}(z_{1},w_{1}))^{2} + (d_{H} z_{2},w_{2}))^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$
where
$$ z = ( z_{1}, z_{2}) , w =  (w_{1}, w_{2})  \in \mathbb{H^{2}} \times \mathbb{H^{2}}.$$ Now consider the set $ E (z,w) = \lbrace x \in \mathbb{H^{2}} \times \mathbb{H^{2}} \mid \gamma( x, z) = \gamma ( x, w) \rbrace $, where $ x = ( x_{1}, x_{2} )$. I want to prove that $E(z,w)$ is connected set. if $ z_{1} = w_{1}$ or $z_{2} = w_{2}$, in that case $E (z,w)$ is simply the product of $ \mathbb{H^{2}}$ with a straight line and hence connected. But if $z_{i} \neq w_{i}$ for $ i = 1 , 2$, In that case why it is connected? Can some help in carrying out the proof?","['hyperbolic-geometry', 'general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'riemannian-geometry']"
2094749,Is the map $p\mapsto\int_X |f|^p d\mu$ differentiable when $\log|f|\notin L^1$?,"Let $(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ be a measure space and $f$ be a measurable function. Suppose $J$ is a nonempty open subinterval of $(0,\infty)$ such that $f\in L^p$ for all $p\in J$, and let $\varphi:J\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be the map given by $\varphi(p)=\int_X |f|^p d\mu$. My goal is to show that $\varphi$ is differentiable  on $J$, with the obvious derivative $\varphi'(p)=\int_X |f|^p\log|f| d\mu$. I have succeeded in proving this under the assumption that $\log|f|\in L^1$. My argument goes as follows: Let $p\in J$ and $(p_n)_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence in $J$ converging to $p$ with $p_n\ne p$ for all $n\geq 1$. Choose a point $q\in J$ such that $p_n<q$ for all $n\geq 1$, a small $\epsilon>0$ such that $q+\epsilon\in J$, and a constant $C_{\epsilon}$ satisfying the inequality $\log t\leq C_{\epsilon}t^{\epsilon}$ for all $t\geq 1$. We have $$\frac{\varphi(p_n)-\varphi(p)}{p_n-p}=\int_{|f|>1}\frac{|f(x)|^{p_n}-|f(x)|^{p}}{p_n-p} d\mu+\int_{|f|\leq 1}\frac{|f(x)|^{p_n}-|f(x)|^{p}}{p_n-p} d\mu$$ and the mean value theorem gives (for each $x$) points $p'_n$ lying between $p_n$ and $p$ such that $\frac{|f(x)|^{p_n}-|f(x)|^{p}}{p_n-p}=|f(x)|^{p'_n} \log|f(x)|$. By our choice of $q$, we have $p'_n<q$ regardless of $x$ and $$\left|\frac{|f(x)|^{p_n}-|f(x)|^{p}}{p_n-p}\right|=|f(x)|^{p'_n}|\log|f(x)||\leq|f(x)|^q\log|f(x)|\leq C_{\epsilon}|f(x)|^{q+\epsilon}$$ whenever $|f(x)|>1$, and $$|f(x)|^{p'_n}|\log|f(x)||\leq|\log|f(x)||$$ whenever $|f(x)|\leq1$. Since $q+\epsilon\in J$, both the functions $|f|^{q+\epsilon}$ and $|\log|f||$ are in $L^1$ and the dominated convergence theorem applies. Hence we have $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\varphi(p_n)-\varphi(p)}{p_n-p}=\int_{|f|>1} |f|^p\log|f| d\mu+\int_{|f|\leq 1} |f|^p\log|f| d\mu=\int_X |f|^p\log|f| d\mu$$ and we conclude that $\varphi$ is differentiable at $p$ with the derivative $\int_X |f|^p\log|f| d\mu$. As above, I have used the additional assumption $\log|f|\in L^1$ in the argument. My questions are: Can this assumption be dropped? Does the expression $\int_X |f|^p\log|f| d\mu$ still make sense when $\log|f|\notin L^1$ ? When $\log|f|\notin L^1$, the integral $\int_X \log|f| d\mu$ exists but equals $-\infty$. In this case, if we further assume that $\mu(X)=1$, is it true that $\lim_{p\rightarrow 0}\Vert f\Vert_p=0$? Please enlighten me. Any advice on the questions or the argument I have made is welcome. Thank you in advance.","['real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'lp-spaces', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory']"

2094782,How to prove that $\lVert x + y\rVert = \lVert x\rVert + \lVert y \rVert \implies \lVert tx + (1-t)y\rVert = t\lVert x\rVert + (1-t)\lVert y \rVert$?,"If a norm on a vector space is given by an inner product then we have $\lVert x + y\rVert = \lVert x \rVert + \lVert y \rVert$ only when $x=\lambda y$ for some constant $\lambda$ (this follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality).
This does not hold for general (unitary invariant) norms.
E.g. when considering generalised Ky Fan norms:
$$ \lVert x\rVert_s = \sum_i s_i \lvert x\rvert_i^\downarrow$$
where $s_i\geq 0$ and $\lvert x\rvert^\downarrow$ is $\lvert x\rvert$ rearranged with the components from biggest to smallest. So for example the operator (sup) norm has $s_1 = 1$ and $s_i=0$ for $i>1$, while the trace norm has $s_i=1$ for all $i$. For these norms it is in general possible to find $x$ and $y$ so that the norm is additive for these vectors, while $x$ and $y$ are not multiples of each other. Now my question is the following. Given a unitarily invariant norm and vectors $x$ and $y$ such that $\lVert x + y\rVert = \lVert x\rVert + \lVert y \rVert$, can we then conclude that $\lVert tx + (1-t)y\rVert = t\lVert x\rVert + (1-t)\lVert y \rVert$ for $0\leq t \leq 1$? This is true for these generalised Ky Fan norms and for all norms that come from inner products. It is also true for all $p$-norms as this additivity still only holds for $x$ and $y$ that are multiples of each other (even though $p$-norms don't come from an inner product). My intuition behind this is that this additivity property (when $x$ and $y$ aren't multiples of each other) forces the norm to be ""linear"" in a certain way, such that the norm has to be very similar to a generalised Ky Fan norm. So as a bonus question: If there are $x$ and $y$ that aren't multiples of each other, such that the norm is additive for these $x$ and $y$, show that the norm is a generalised Ky Fan norm. Note that this can only be true when we assume the norm to be unitary invariant since otherwise we can construct a counter-example of this (take $(X_1,\lVert\cdot\rVert_1)\oplus (X_2,\lVert\cdot\rvert_2)$ with the norm $\sup\{\lVert\cdot\rVert_1,\lVert\cdot\rVert_2\}$ where $\lVert\cdot\rVert_1$ is a Ky Fan norm and $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is some other norm).","['normed-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

2095071,Define the multiplication operation on the following equivalence class,"I am having trouble forming the proof for the following: Let $ m > 0 $ .

Suppose $ a_1 \equiv a_2 $ (congruent mod $ m $ ) and $ b_1 \equiv b_2 $ (congruent mod $ m $ ). We have to show $ a_1 + b_1 \equiv a_2 + b_2 $ (congruent mod $ m $ ).
By assumption $ m \,|\, a_1 - a_2 $ , and $ m \,|\, b_1 - b_2 $ . Therefore $ m \,|\, (a_1 - a_2) + (b_1 - b_2) $ , which after reorganizing the right-hand side gives $ m \,|\, (a_1 + b_1) - (a_2 + b_2) $ , i.e., $ a_1 + b_1 \equiv a_2 + b_2 \, \text{mod } m $ , as required. I understand what ""congruent mod $m$ "" means, but I'm unsure what an equivalence class and equivalence relation are.

I was calculating the temperature of the center of the plate analytically to sanity-check my program output, when I encountered this weird-looking sum. I remember I made a spreadsheet to numerically evaluate the sum, and Excel said 0.2500000... So I jot down $\frac14$ with a question mark beside it. The next page is filled with my fruitless attempts to find out the exact sum, to convince myself that the sum is exactly $1/4$ . I posted a bounty on my social media accounts, whoever can show the proof (or disproof) gets free beer. After a few days, the bounty was still unclaimed, but I realized, "" duuuuuhhhh! I could just exploit the symmetry. If I rotate the plate $90^\circ$ three times and superpose all the temperature distribution with the original one, temperature is $1$ unit everywhere. By linearity and symmetry, the temperature of the center point is therefore $1/4$ . "" I treated myself a few rounds of beer, and moved on. Case closed. Looking again at this, I now realize that I might be missing out on some summation tactics I never knew. Anybody can show me how is this equal to $1/4$ just by algebraic manipulation?",['sequences-and-series']

$$1-\tan^2⁡x$$ We both figured out that all three of the examples are the same. However, I said that three statements were correct while, he said two statements were correct.

2095575,Eigenvectors of complex matrix,"I'm working on a problem where I am trying to find the eigenvectors of a pretty complicated matrix, and I am in need of some assistance. The matrix in question is: $$A =\begin{bmatrix}

However, I'm not sure how to use these properties to find the possible eigenvectors (if that would even help), and I would like to avoid doing it by brute force if possible, as it seem unruly. Thus far, I have tried to separate the matrix into real and imaginary parts, but that didn't seem to help.

I have to show that $X \cong Y$. I don't know what is the best way of doing this : if I should pick equation or try to reason geometrically. Let's try to find equations : let's says the conic is the intersection of the quadric $xy - zw = 0$ with some hyperplane $l = 0$ : then $X$ is the subset of $\mathbb P^3 \times \mathbb P^1$ defined by the equations $u(xy - zw) = lv$ were $(u,v)$ are the standard coordinates on $\mathbb P^1$.

I agree this equation is a bit strange but I wanted my quadric to be smooth and $(0,0,0,0,1)$ be in my quadric so I can blow up simply in affine coordinates. The blow up of my quadric at a point is given by some affine equations : for example one of the equations (in the affine chart $x_4 = 1$ with coordinates $u_i = \frac{x_i}{x_3}$) is $\sum_{i=0}^2 x_3u_i(x_3u_i + 1) + x_3(x_3 + 1) = 0$.

Let me tell you what I think I know, and please correct me if I'm wrong. Relative Extrema is the local maximum or minimum of a 'hill' of a graph of a polynomial of the second degree or higher. In other words, a relative extrema (extremum? extreme?) is a point where the derivative is 0. This can be found by finding where the derivative changes signs. Can this also be found just by looking where the derivative is 0? Is that the same thing? Which is easier? Critical Points , also known as stationary points(?), is any point where the derivative is equal to 0. This can be found using the same method as above. Inflection Points is the point where the rate of change of the derivative of the graph switches signs. In other words, the point where the curvature of the graph changes from concave up to down or vice versa. This can be found by finding the double derivative and finding when its sign changes/finding its zeroes (which is easier?). Now my main problem is figuring out where these overlap. So these are my questions that I can't really get to the bottom of: Are all relative extrema critical points? Are all critical points relative extrema? Can a critical point ever not be a relative extrema? Will an inflection point always be distinct from a relative extrema and a critical point?","['derivatives', 'calculus', 'graphing-functions']"

2096052,Uniform convergence not a topological property?,"Suppose I have a sequence of functions $f_n: X \to Y$ between metric spaces that converges uniformly to $f$. Then if I change the metric on $Y$ to a Lipschitz equivalent metric, the sequence of functions will still converge uniformly to $f$. However, I am told that if I change the metric on $Y$ in such a way that does not disturb the induced topology, then $f_n$ may no longer converge uniformly. My question is: is there a simple example of a sequence of functions from $X$ to two homeomorphic metric spaces $Y$, $Y'$ converging uniformly in one but not the other?

2096105,Is there a relationship between the trace and the Clifford/geometric product?,"In what follows, let $V=\mathbb{R}^n$ (although the following probably applies also to a larger number of finite-dimensional spaces). We assume throughout that we have made a choice for an inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ on $V$. Geometric/Clifford Product: The geometric/Clifford product of any two vectors $v,w \in V$ decomposes as: $$v w = \langle v, w\rangle + v \wedge w\,, $$ where the first term on the right-hand side is the inner product of $v,w$, and the second term corresponds to the bivector spanned by $v$ and $w$ in that orientation. Trace: Our choice of inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ on $V$ induces a canonical (w.r.t. $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$) isomorphism between $V$ and $V^*$. This allows us to identify $V \otimes V$ and $V^* \otimes V$, and $V^* \otimes V$ can always be identified with $\operatorname{End}(V)=\operatorname{Hom}(V,V)=\mathscr{L}(V)$ the space of linear operators on $V$ ( I think ). Then the bilinear function $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : V \times V \to \mathbb{R}$ induces under the identification $V^* \cong V$ a bilinear function $V^* \times V \to \mathbb{R}$ which via the universal property of tensor products induces a linear function $V^* \otimes V \cong \operatorname{End}(V) \to \mathbb{R}$ which turns out to be the trace. (See my two previous questions (1) (2) of which this question is a follow-up.) Now note that the kernel of the trace $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{R})$, and also note that an important subspace of $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{R})$ is $\mathfrak{o}(n,\mathbb{R})=\mathfrak{so}(n,\mathbb{R})$, which can be identified with the space of all skew-symmetric matrices. The latter space, $\mathfrak{so}(n,\mathbb{R})$, can be identified with the space of all bivectors (see here or here ). Thus, by factoring through $V^* \otimes V$, the Clifford/geometric product decomposition above assumes the form $$(v,w) \mapsto (v^*,w) \mapsto v^* \otimes w \mapsto \operatorname{trace}(v^* \otimes w) + v \wedge w = \operatorname{trace}(v^* \otimes w) + (v^* \otimes w - w^* \otimes v)\,,  $$ with the first term $\operatorname{trace}(v^* \otimes w)$ being in the image of the trace and the second term $v \wedge w$ being in the kernel. Thus the decomposition of the Clifford product $vw$ seems to (implicitly) have the form of an image-kernel decomposition with respect to the linear map trace. Question: Is this correct? Can the Clifford product really be interpreted as being related to or derived from the trace? Specifically, it seems like in the above we are disregarding the elements $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{R}) \setminus \mathfrak{so}(n,\mathbb{R})$. Thus (assuming that there is a natural splitting of $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{R})= S \oplus \mathfrak{so}(n,\mathbb{R}) $, and I don't know whether there is or isn't), can the quotienting process which gives us the Clifford algebra from the tensor algebra be considered as equivalent to ""quotienting out"" those elements of the kernel of the trace which are not also skew-symmetric operators? Or am I over-simplifying? Also for some reason I thought there might be some relationship between this and semidirect products of Lie groups, but I don't know that topic anywhere near well enough for that to be considered anything besides wild speculation based on visual similarities of the formulas.","['tensor-products', 'geometric-algebras', 'clifford-algebras', 'linear-algebra', 'lie-algebras']"

2096416,Taylor series from discrete series - Approximation / Lagrange remainder?,"Apologies if this question is already known - I have three population ($x(t),y(t)$ and $z(t)$ evalutated at discrete time steps. If we define the sum of these as $T(t) = x(t) + y(t) + z(t)$, you can write $x(t+1) = ax(t)T(t)$ $y(t+1) = by(t)T(t)$ $z(t+1) = cz(t)T(t)$ where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants. For now, $T(t)$ is a constant. If so, one can solve this as a recursive series. However, for a variety of reasons we'd prefer to make this a series of ODEs if possible. Naively, from Taylor's theorem, we know that a function can be written as a sum of the form $x(t + \delta t) = x(t) + \delta t x'(t) + .....$ If we let $\delta t = 1$, and truncate the series after the first derivative, then we might write these as a system of ODEs after re-arrangement to get.. $x'(t) \approx x(t)(aT(t) - 1)$ $y'(t) \approx y(t)(bT(t) - 1)$ $z'(t) \approx z(t)(cT(t) - 1)$ Solving this seems to give answers close to the exact solution (see image attached, these are acceptably close for our purposes) but I'd like to quantify the error if I can - I considered using a version of Lagrange Remainder formula, but since the form here is cobbled together from a discrete series I don't think there's any way of doing this? The other question I have involves our motivation for switching to ODEs - it would be great if we could consider situations where $T(t)$ might not be constant, and there may be growth or decay with time, for example if a growth term $g$ was added to $x$ so that $x'(t) \approx x(t)(aT(t) - 1) + g$ . There might also be situations when $a,b,$ and $c$ could be themselves functions of time.

2096476,Local systems and connections on elliptic curves,"Let $(E,O)$ be an elliptic curve over $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{C})$. Then a 1-dimenstional represenation of $\pi_1(E^{\mathrm{an}}) =  \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is just a pair of elements $(a, b)$ of $\mathbb{C}^\times$. Under a standard equivalence of categories, the representation corresponding to a pair $(a, b)$ corresponds to an analytic connection on $E^{\mathrm{an}}$ which we'll denote by $L^{\mathrm{an}}_{(a,b)}$ (see, e.g., theorem 4.2.4 in the book ""D-modules, perverse sheaves and representation theory"" in the book by Hotta et al). One description of $L^{\mathrm{an}}_{(a,b)}$ is given in Mariano's answer below. Now we have a equivalence of categories between analytic connections on $E^{\mathrm{an}}$ and algebraic connections on $E$ (see, e.g., corollary 5.3.9 in Hotta et al.). I'd like to know an explicit description of the algebraic connection $L_{(a,b)}$ on $E$ corresponding to the analytic connection $L^{\mathrm{an}}_{(a,b)}$ on $E^{\mathrm{an}}$ under this equivalence. The first step would be to determine the underlying invertible $\mathscr{O}_E$-module, which should be of degree 0 (see, e.g., Atiyah's ""Complex Analytic Connections in Fiber Bundles,"" proposition 19). But $\mathrm{Pic}^0(E) = E(\mathbb{C})$ since $E$ is an elliptic curve. In other words, we get a map $$(\mathbb{C}^\times)^2 \to E(\mathbb{C}),$$ taking $(a,b) \in (\mathbb{C}^\times)^2$ to the closed point $P_{(a,b)} \in E(\mathbb{C})$ such that $\mathscr{O}_E(P_{(a,b)}-O)$ is the line bundle underlying the connection $L_{(a,b)}$. What is $P_{(a,b)}$ in terms of $(a, b)$? Given $P \in E(\mathbb{C})$, what are the $(a,b) \in (\mathbb{C}^\times)^2$ such that $P = P_{(a,b)}$? How can we describe the connection on $L_{(a,b)}$ in terms of $(a, b)$? We know that $\Omega^1_E$ has a global nowhere-vanishing section $\omega$. Let $\partial$ be the derivation of $\mathscr{O}_E$ dual to $\omega$. We know that $L_{(a,b)}$ is trivial on $E \setminus \{O, P_{(a,b)}\}$, so the connection on this open is given by a differential equation of the form $\partial - f$ for some $f \in \Gamma(U, \mathscr{O}_E)$.

Mathematica gives: $$\int_0^1 \frac{1+z^2}{1+z^4} z^p \, dz=\frac{1}{8} \left(\psi \left(\frac{p+5}{8}\right)+\psi\left(\frac{p+7}{8}\right)-\psi\left(\frac{p+1}{8}\right)-\psi \left(\frac{p+3}{8}\right)\right)$$ Is a closed form possible for $I(p)$ for general $p$, not represented as an infinite series of polygamma functions, but something nicer? Maybe contour integration can help here? As a separate question, could it be possible to find an ODE for $I(p)$ as a function? It would be almost as good as a closed form to me. The motivation is this question . An asymptotic series for $p \to 0$ (obtained by integration of the Taylor series by term) starts as: $$I(p) \approx \frac{\pi}{2 \sqrt{2}} \left( 1-\frac{3 \pi ^2 p^2}{32}+\frac{95 \pi ^4 p^4}{2048}-\frac{18727 \pi ^6 p^6}{327680}+\frac{23151383 \pi ^8 p^8}{176160768}-\dots \right)=$$ $$=\sum_{n=0}^m (-1)^n \frac{A000364(n) A000281(n)}{(2n)!} \frac{\pi^{2n}}{4^{2n}}p^{2n}$$ The numerator is a product of A000364 and A000281 . However, this series does not converge - the numerator grows faster than the denominator for all $p$ as far as I can see.

Let's call a function $f\colon X\longrightarrow \mathbb{K}$ smooth (in whatever sense we are interested in) if there is an open neighbourhood $X\subseteq U\subseteq E$ of $X$ and a smooth function $\widetilde{f}\colon U\longrightarrow\mathbb{K}$ such that $\widetilde{f}|_{X}=f$. Then $X$ with the induced topology and the sheaf defined by $\mathcal{C}_X^\infty(V)=\left\{\text{Smooth functions }V\longrightarrow \mathbb{K}\big.\right\}$ forms a locally $\mathbb{K}$-ringed space. Let us define an ugly manifold to be a locally $\mathbb{K}$-ringed space which is locally isomorphic to a locally ringed space of the form $(X,\mathcal{C}_X^\infty)$, where $X$ is any subset of a (finite dimensional) Banach space. A manifold is a locally ringed space, locally isomorphic to $(U,\mathcal{C}_U^\infty)$ for some open subset $U$ of a Banach space. A manifold with boundary is a locally $\mathbb{R}$-ringed space, locally isomorphic to $(X,\mathcal{C}_X^\infty)$, where $X=\left\{x\in E\ \middle|\ \lambda(x)\ge 0\right\}$, for $E$ a Banach space and $\lambda$ some continous linear form on $E$; and similarly a manifold with corners can be defined. So my questions is: Which properties of open subsets, half spaces and corners spaces (if this is the correct word) are essential for the theory of manifolds to work. What breaks down for ugly manifolds? tangent spaces, differential forms, etc. come to mind here. Is there a class of subsets of (finite dimensional) Banach spaces, which lead to nice manifolds and yield a more flexible category? For example not like manifolds with boundary, which are not closed under products. Note that I know almost nothing about analysis; in particular I haven't yet taken a course on real analysis or something like that. I've only read most of Torsten Wedhorn's book Manifolds, Sheaves and Cohomology since I am more an algebraically minded type of person, so I'd appreciate, if your answer was accessible to such.","['manifolds', 'sheaf-theory', 'differential-geometry']"
2096549,What can be said about adjunctions between groups (regarded as one-object categories)?,"I am trying to answer to this question: What can be said about adjunctions between groups (regarded as one-object categories)? Here is what I have arrived at till now, but I can't conclude in some way. I mean, it seams to me that one last step is missing. Let's consider $G_1$ and $G_2$ groups and let's view them as one-object categories $\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\mathcal{G}_2$,
whose only objects are $G_1$ and $G_2$ respectively.\
Let's then take $F:\mathcal{G}_1\longrightarrow\mathcal{G}_2$, $H:\mathcal{G}_2\longrightarrow\mathcal{G}_1$ functors
and suppose $F\dashv H$. This is equivalent to state that the map $\eta_{G_1}:G_1\longrightarrow HF(G_1)$ is initial
in $(G_1\Rightarrow H)$ (it suffices to state it for this only map $\eta_{G_1}$ since $G_1$ is the only object
of $\mathcal{G}_1$). However, being $\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\mathcal{G}_2$ one-object categories, we already know how
the functors $F$ and $H$ are defined on objects, namely $F(G_1)=G_2$ and $H(G_2)=G_1$. So the map $\eta_{G_1}$ is
nothing but a function from $G_1$ to itself.\
Let's now look at the comma category $(G_1\Rightarrow H)$. Its objects are the maps of the form $g_1:G_1\longrightarrow
H(G_2)$, so they are simply the functions from $G_1$ to itself. A map between $g_1$ and $g_1'$ in $(G_1\Rightarrow H)$
is a function $g_2:G_2\longrightarrow G_2$ such that $g_1'=H(g_2)\circ g_1$, so we can write it as ``$g_1\rightarrow
H(g_2)$''.\
Now, we want to impose that $\eta_{G_1}$ is an initial object in $(G_1\Rightarrow H)$. So let $g_1$ be an arbitrary
object in $Ob(\mathcal{G}_1)$, and we force the map $g_2\in (G_1\Rightarrow H)(\eta_{G_1},g_1)$ to be unique.
Thus we must have $g_2$ to be the unique map such that $g_1=H(g_2)\circ \eta_{G_1}$. So now, what can we say really interesting about this $g_2$??? Thanks in advance for any help!","['category-theory', 'adjoint-functors', 'group-theory']"

If you pick three balls at random without replacement, what is the probability that you pick a different colored ball each time?

I've managed to come up with a proof that seems reasonable to me but I'm not sure if it is actually correct. Could someone tell me if I made any beginner's mistakes? My proof: Clearly $x^4+1$ has no root in $\mathbb{Q}$ , so it can only be decomposed into two polynomials of degree $2$ . Therefore there must be $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}$ s.t. $x^4+1=(x^2+ax+1)(x^2+bx+1)$ . If we multiply this out we get $x^4+(a+b)x^3+(ab+2)x^2+(a+b)x+1$ . If we now equate the coefficients we get that $a+b = 0$ and therefore $a = -b$ and that $ab+2=0$ and therefore that $a^2=2$ , which is not possible in $\mathbb{Q}$ .
