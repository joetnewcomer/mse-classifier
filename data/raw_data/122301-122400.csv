1839632,Formalization of an intuitive idea to construct a surjection,"Let $A$ be an arbitrary set and $B$ be any non-empty set. Furthermore, suppose that there is no injection from $A$ to $B$. I want to prove that it follows that there is a surjection from $A$ to $B$. I have an intuitive argument in mind to prove this, but I do not know how to formalize it. Here is this intuitive argument:
Since $B$ is non-empty, there has to be a function from $A$ to $B$. Let us fix one such a function $f_0\colon A \to B$. The idea is to modify this function $f_0$ using the fact that there is no injection from $A$ to $B$ to  get a surjective function. If $f_0$ is surjective, then we are done. So the interesting case is the case where there are some elements of $B$ that are not in the image of $f_0$. Our job is to modify $f_0$ in such a way that these elements of $B$ are hit too. Let $b_0$ be an element of $B$ which is not in the image of $f_0$. Since $f_0$ is not injective, there are two distinct elements $a_0, {a_0}'\in A$ such that $f_0(a_0)=f_0({a_0}')$. Now we can define a function $f_1\colon A\to B$ as follows: if $a\not = {a_0}'$ then $f_1(a) := f_0(a)$, and if $a={a_0}'$ then $f_1(a):=b_0$. If $f_1$ is surjective, then we are done. Otherwise we can do the same again: Let $b_1$ be an element of $B$ which is not in the image of $f_1$. Since $f_1$ is not injective, there are two distinct elements $a_1, {a_1}'\in A$ such that $f_1(a_1)=f_1({a_1}')$. Now we can define a function $f_2\colon A\to B$ as follows: if $a\not = {a_1}'$ then $f_2(a) := f_1(a)$, and if $a={a_0}'$ then $f_2(a):=b_1$. We can iterate this process a finite number of times. Thus, if the image of $f_0$ is finite, then $f_n\colon A\to B$ is surjective, where $n$ is the cardinality of the image of $f_0$. Intuitively I think that this argument also works if the image of $f_0$ is countably infinite. Then we can carry out the same process to construct functions $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$, $f_4$ and so on. Then the limit $f_\omega$ of this countably infinite process is a surjective function $A\to B$. Indeed, I also think that this kind of argument always works. We can iterate this process until every element of $B$ is hit, if necessary by constructing functions $f_{\omega + 1}$, $f_{\omega + 2}$, $f_{\omega +3}$, ..., 
$f_{\omega\cdot 2}$, ..., $f_{\omega\cdot 3}$, ..., $f_{\omega\cdot\omega}$, ..., $f_{\alpha}$ (where $\alpha$ is an ordinal number). How can one formalize this idea and turn it into a rigorous proof?",['elementary-set-theory']

1839771,Two questions on completely regular filters in locales,"I'm reading the exposition of the Stone-Čech compactification for locales in Johnstone's book Stone Spaces . In Chapter IV Paragraph 2.2, Johnstone constructs the Stone-Čech compactification of a locale $A$ as the locale $C(A)$ of completely regular ideals in $A$, and in Paragraph 2.3 he shows that the points of $C(A)$ may be identified with the maximal completely regular filters in $A$. There are two points here where I was unable to follow the reasoning. Unfortunately, they're a bit technical. Let's start with the definitions. Fix a locale $A$. We say that $a$ is well inside $b$, written $a \eqslantless b$, if there exists $c$ such that $a\land c = 0_A$ and $b\lor c = 1_A$. Equivalently, we could just require that $b \lor \lnot a = 1_A$. We say that $a$ is really inside $b$, written $a \,\unicode{x02A9B}\, b$ if there is a scale between $a$ and $b$, i.e. if there exist $\{c_q\mid q\in \mathbb{Q}\cap [0,1]\}$ such that $a\leq c_0$, $c_1\leq b$, and $c_p \eqslantless c_q$ for all $p<q$. We say that $A$ is completely regular if $a = \bigvee_A\{b\mid b\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,a\}$ for all $a$. We say that an ideal $I\subseteq A$ is completely regular if for all $a\in I$ there exists $b\in I$ with $a\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,b$. We say that a filter $F\subseteq A$ is completely regular if for all $a\in F$ there exists $b\in F$ with $b\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,a$. $C(A)$ is the locale of completely regular ideals of $A$. $C(A)$ is a subframe of $\mathrm{Idl}(A)$, so the meet of finitely many completely regular ideals is their intersection and join of some completely regular ideals is the ideal generated by the union. Further, $C(A)$ is compact and completely regular. Question 1: Lemma 2.3 states that the poset of completely regular filters of $A$ is isomorphic to the poset of completely regular filters of $C(A)$. In the last step, Johnstone writes, ""A similar argument shows $\overline{f}_*\overline{f}^*(G) = G$ for any completely regular filter $G$ of $C(A)$."" It doesn't matter what the functions $\overline{f}_*$, $\overline{f}^*$, $f_*$, and $f^*$ are: What matters is that for $J\in C(A)$, $f_*f^*(J) = \{a\in A\mid a \,\unicode{x02A9B}\, \bigvee_A J\}$, and $\overline{f}_*\overline{f}^*(G)$ is the filter of $C(A)$ generated by $f_*f^*(J)$ for all $J\in G$. Since $J$ is completely regular, $J\subseteq f_*f^*(J)$ for all $J$, so $f_*f^*(J) \in G$, and it is clear that $\overline{f}_*\overline{f}^*(G) \subseteq G$. To prove the converse, we would like to take any completely regular ideal $I\in G$ and find some $J\in G$ such that $f_*f^*(J) \subseteq I$. Since $G$ is completely regular, there is some $J\in G$ with $J\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,I$, so it would be reasonable to try to prove that $J\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,I$ implies $f_*f^*(J)\subseteq I$. But I don't see how to do this. Question 2: In the second half of Proposition 2.3, $A$ is a compact completely regular locale. We are given a maximal completely regular filter $F$, which we would like to show is prime. If $a\lor b\in F$ and $a\notin F$, we construct the filter $G = \{c\in A\mid c\lor b\in F\}$. It's easy to see that $G$ is a filter and $F\subsetneq G$. But Johnstone writes that $G$ ""is easily seen to be completely regular"". So suppose $c\in G$. We need to find some $e\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,c$ with $e\in G$. Well, $c\lor b\in F$, and since $F$ is completely regular there is some $d\in F$ with $d\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,c\lor b$. Since $c\land (c\lor b) = c$, it would be natural to hope that $e = c\land d$ works. But it is not true in general that $x \,\unicode{x02A9B}\,y$ implies $z\land x \,\unicode{x02A9B}\, z\land y$.","['topos-theory', 'lattice-orders', 'locales', 'filters', 'general-topology']"

I've been struggling with this problem for quite some time now and the reason is that I don't want to change my starting matrix $S$. This is equivalent to creating a tight frame of $\mathbb{R}^{mn+v}$, $v\geq 0$  when you already know some of its vectors.

1839808,Difficulty understanding step in Kac's proof of Feynman-Kac Theorem,"I am trying to understand a proof of the Feynman-Kac Theorem , as set out in Mark Kac's 1949 paper 'On Distributions of Certain Wiener Functionals' . Kac defines a series of independent and identically distributed, discrete random variables $\left( X_i\right)_{i\in\mathbb N}$, each of which has value either 1 or $-1$ with equal probability. On page 6 he makes the following statement, without providing any justification: $$\mathbb{P}\left\{\sum_{i=1}^k X_i=m\right\}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}e^{-im\xi}\cos^k\xi\ d\xi$$ for any $m\in\mathbb Z$. I am totally stumped as to how this formula is justified. The left-hand side should be fairly simple as, if my calculations are correct, it is equal to 
$$\mathbb{P}\left\{2M_k^{0.5}-k=m\right\}$$
where $M_k^p$ is a binomial random variable that is the result of $k$ trials with probability of success $p$. The integral on the right looks like it will have a complex result, and hence not be equal to that on the left. Complex numbers and integrals have played no part in the paper up to that point, so their sudden introduction is a complete surprise. Also, while I could not integrate the expression, Wolfram Alpha says the indefinite integral is (replacing $\xi$ by $x$): $$i\frac{2^{-k}(e^{-ix}+e^{ix})(1+e^{2ix})^{-k}e^{-imx}{}_2F_1(-k,-\frac k2-\frac m2;-\frac k2-\frac m2+1;-e^{-2ix})}{k+m}
$$ where the ${}_2F_1$ item is the hypergeometric function. For $x=0$ this is $$i\frac{2^{-k}\cdot 2^k\cdot2^{-k}\cdot 1\cdot {}_2F_1(-k,-\frac k2-\frac m2;-\frac k2-\frac m2+1;-1)}{k+m}
$$which is
$$i\frac{2^{-k}\cdot {}_2F_1(-k,-\frac k2-\frac m2;-\frac k2-\frac m2+1;-1)}{k+m}
$$which is
$$i\cdot\frac{2^{-k}}b\cdot {}_2F_1(-k,-b;1-b;-1)
$$where $b\equiv (k+m)/2$. The same value should be obtained for $x=2\pi$, so it seems to me that, based on that, the definite integral should be zero. I am stuck in a situation where, not only can I see neither motivation nor justification for Kac's introduction of the formula on the RHS, but on my (quite possibly faulty) calculations, that step seems to lead to an impossible result. I would be very grateful to anybody that can help me understand this. Thank you very much.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'probability']"

1839834,Number Theory and d-Self-Contained Numbers,"Given any natural number $N = a_{n}a_{n-1}\ldots a_{1}$, let us associate to it the set $S_{N} = \bigcup_{j=1}^{n}\{(a_{j},j)\}$. We're going to define a d-self-contained number as any natural number which satisfies the rule:
\begin{align*}
&\forall k\leq n,\exists\sigma\subset S_{N}\setminus\{(a_{k},k)\}; a_{k} = \sum_{s\in\sigma}(-1)^{e_{s}}\|p_{1}(s)\|^{d},\\
&\text{where}\,\,n\geq 3,\,\,e_{s}\in\{0,1\}\,\,\text{and}\,\,\#\sigma\geq 2
\end{align*}
In other words, a number is d-self-contained if each of its digits can be obtained from the others as a linear combination of their d-th power (where d is natural and fixed) whose coefficients belong to the set {-1,0,1}, where at least two of these coefficients are non-zero terms. It is worth saying that $p_{1}$ is the projection mapping on the first coordinate. Let us work it through examples.
The number 101 is 2-self-contained since we can rewrite its digits as: $1 = 0^{2} + 1^{2}$ and $0 = 1^{2} - 1^{2}$. Furthermore, the number 101 is d-self-contained for every d. Indeed, we have: 
$$1 = 0 + 1 = 0^{d} + 1^{d}\,\,\text{and}\,\,0 = 1 - 1 = 1^{d} - 1^{d}$$
On the other hand, the number 121 is not 2-self-contained given that:
$$1 \neq 2^{2} - 1^{2}\,\,\text{and}\,\,1\neq 2^{2} + 1^{2}$$
Although it is 1-self-contained. What about the 3-self-contained numbers? Here it comes an example which proves that they exist: 111111112. Undoubtedly, its digits satisfy the following relationships:
$$1 = 2^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3} - 1^{3}\,\,\text{and}\,\,2 = 1^{3} + 1^{3}$$
Even more, this number is also 1,2-self-contained. Really, we have:
$$1 = 2 - 1\,\,\text{and}\,\,2 = 1 + 1;\quad
1 = 2^{2} - 1^{2} - 1^{2} - 1^{2}\,\,\text{and}\,\,2 = 1^{2} + 1^{2}$$
Besides that, this example provides us with a way to build any d-self-contained number:
$$N = \overbrace{11\ldots 1}^{2^{d}}2\Rightarrow 2^{d} = \overbrace{1^{d} + 1^{d} + \ldots + 1^{d}}^{2^{d}}\,\,\text{and}\,\,1 = 2^{d} - \overbrace{1^{d} - 1^{d} - \ldots - 1^{d}}^{2^{d} - 1}$$
Since the definition has been made clear, I would like to make some questions. First of all, does any one can propose any criterion to identify them quickly? In second place, is there any formula which generates them all? And, finally, if we denote the set of d-self-contained numbers by $A_{d}$, does the next proposition hold: $A_{1}\supset A_{2}\supset\ldots\supset A_{k}\supset\ldots$?

1839836,Proof that group of invertible elements in a Banach algebra have 1 or infinite connected components?,"I'm trying to reconcile this proof that I've read that a group of invertible elements in a commutative (complex) Banach algebra have 1 or infinite connected components with this example I'm looking at.

The singular values of this Banach algebra are, I think $\{\lambda(a+e):\lambda\in\mathbb C\}$ and $\{\lambda(a-e):\lambda\in\mathbb C\}$, which should create $4$ quadrants. The gist of the proof is that $\sigma(a)=\{1,-1\}$, so define a logarithm branch on $\Omega\supseteq\sigma(a)$.  Extend this to $\mathcal B$, basically by its power series.  Now $a'=\log(a)\in\mathcal B$, so that $\exp(\lambda a'),\lambda\in[0,1]$ is a path connecting $a$ to $e$.

1840159,Prove a group of order 12 must have an element of order 2 [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Group of even order contains an element of order 2 (2 answers) Closed 8 years ago . Question: Prove that a group of order 12 must have an element of order 2. I believe I've made great stride in my attempt. By corollary to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element $g$ in a group $G$ divides the order of a group $G$. So, $ \left | g \right | \mid \left | G \right |$.
Hence, the possible orders of $g$ is $\left | g \right |=\left \{ 1,2,3,4,6,12 \right \}$ Suppose $\left | g \right |=12.$
Then, $g^{12}=\left ( g^{6} \right )^{2}=e.$
So, $\left | g^{6} \right |=2$ Using the above same idea and applying it to $\left | g \right |=\left \{ 6,4,2 \right \}$ and $\left | g \right |=1,$
we see that these elements g have order 2. However, for $\left | g^{3} \right |$, the group $G$ does not require an element of order 2. How can I take this attempt further? Thanks in advance. Useful hints would be helpful.",['group-theory']
1840176,Explanation needed for a statement about power series convergence,"I got a task in front of me but I don't really understand it. If someone could explain, I think I would be able to solve it myself. $P(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}x^{k}$ is a power series. There exists a $k_{0} \in \mathbb{N}$ with $a_{k} \neq 0$ for all $k \geq k_{0}$. Proof that: If the sequence $\left ( \left | \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_{k}} \right | \right )_{k \geq k_{0}}$ converges towards a number in $\mathbb{R}$ or towards $\infty$ and if $a:= \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \left | \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_{k}} \right | \in \mathbb{R} \cup \left \{ \infty \right \}$ indicates this limit point ($\infty $ or $-\infty$) then following applies for the radius of convergence $R$ of $P$: $R=\left\{\begin{matrix}
0, & a = \infty\\ 
\infty, & a = 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{a}, & otherwise 
\end{matrix}\right.$ What is meant by $k_{0}$ ? It's just any unknown variable which seems to be smaller or equal $k$, right? Oh and it cannot be smaller than zero. What is $a_{k}$ ? It's just any sequence that cannot be zero, right? So first I take the sequence $a_{n}$, use the ratio test to see if it converges. Okay after that is done, I check if in the ratio test, I get + or - $\infty$. Is it right so far?

More particular case is that for any $x\in[0,1]$ we have $\mu(A\cap [0,x])=\mu(B\cap [0,x])$ and hence $\mu(A\cap [0,x])=\frac{x}{2}$. Metaphor. Such decomposition can be assosiated with mixture of liquids. Suppose we have two liquids of equal amount. We bottle them, shake them up and then pour some into the glass. No matter how much we pour, the glass will contain equal amount of both liquids. Ideas. We can decompose $[0,1]$ as $X\sqcup Y$ where $X=[0,1]\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ and $Y=[0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q}$. Here we have $\mu(X)=1$ and $\mu(Y)=0$. Maybe it's possible to describe a procedure of moving points from $X$ to $Y$ (i.e. excluding them from $X$ and including in $Y$) that will lead to desired decomposition. Another thought is to set $A_n=\bigsqcup_{k=0}^{2^{n-1}-1}[2k\cdot2^{-n},\ (2k+1)\cdot2^{-n})$ and $B_n=[0,1]\setminus A_n$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

Origin. This question arose after I read this post . It's interesting whether the condition of Riemann integrability is crucial there or we could weaken it with Lebesgue integrability. In attempts to find counterexample I thought of above mentioned decomposition. If it exists then we could define $f(x)=1$ if $x\in A$ and $f(x)=-1$ if $x\in B$. That would be our counterexample because $\int_I f\,d\mu$ would be zero for any interval $I\in[0,1]$. Generalization.

1840459,Which concepts in Differential Geometry can NOT be represented using Geometric Algebra?,"1. It is not clear to me that linear duals, and not just Hodge duals, can be represented in geometric algebra at all. See, for example, here . Can linear duals (i.e. linear functionals) be represented using the geometric algebra formalism? 2. It also seems like most tensors cannot be represented, see for example here . This makes intuitive sense since any geometric algebra is a quotient of the corresponding tensor algebra. Also it seems like only some contravariant tensors (and no covariant tensors whatsoever) can be represented unless the answer to 1. is no. Which types of tensors admit a representation using geometric algebra? 3. The exterior algebra under which differential forms operate can clearly be represented by geometric algebra and its outer product. However, do objects ""sufficiently isomorphic"" to differential forms admit a representation in geometric algebra? This would be preferred given how geometric algebra is more geometrically intuitive than differential forms. See also here . 4. This question seemingly depends on the answers to 1. and 3. , since derivations=vector fields are the linear dual of differential forms. Can vector fields=derivations be represented using geometric algebra? This paper seems to suggest that the answer is yes, although it was unclear to me. It also listed as references Snygg's and Hestene's books for representing derivations=vector fields via geometric algebra. However, I quickly searched Snygg's book and could not even find the use of the word ""bundle"" once, which seems to cast doubt on the claim. Moreover, derivations are just the Lie algebra of smooth functions between manifolds, correct? Since Lie algebras are non-associative, it seems doubtful to me that derivations could be represented effectively by the associative geometric algebra. On the other hand, quaternions are somehow also Lie algebras , and they can be represented in geometric algebra , so I am not sure. 5. This probably a duplicate of 4. but I am asking it anyway. Do tangent/cotangent spaces/bundles admit a representation using geometric algebra? This one is especially unclear to me, since using ""ctrl-f"" the word ""bundle"" is not used even once in Snygg's book ""Differential Geometry via Geometric Algebra"", which appears to be the most thorough treatment of the subject. (Incidentally, the word ""dual"" also only appears once, in reference to Pyotr Kapitza's dual British and Russian citizenship.) Basically I am wondering if differential geometry can be ""translated"" completely using the language of geometric algebra. I think the answer is no because Hestene's conjecture regarding smooth and vector manifolds has yet to be proved (see the comments here), but it seems like we would run up with barriers even sooner than that. Although I probably am misunderstanding the comment. I have found differential geometry difficult to understand at times, and would like to learn it by translating it as much into geometric algebra and then back. The extent to which the two is ""equivalent"" obviously presents a barrier to how much this is possible. Still, I already feel like I understand the concepts and motivations of multilinear algebra and related fields much better after having just learned a little geometric algebra, and would like to apply this as much as possible to the rest of differential geometry. These questions are also related: symmetric products are the inner product from geometric algebra, and wedge products are the outer product from geometric algebra ; geometric algebra is a special type of Clifford algebra which contains the exterior algebra over the reals ; and this question discusses derivations in algebras in detail.","['tensor-products', 'duality-theorems', 'tensors', 'geometric-algebras', 'differential-geometry']"

  is admissible (that means, $\mathbb{1}_{\phi(B)}$ is
  Riemann-integrable), f is continuous almost everywhere. My work: I tried to assume f is not continuous almost everywhere.
That means that there is a segment in $\mathbb{R}$ $[x1,x2]$ where f is not riemann-integrable. so we look at that segment and take the box defined by $(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x2,y1),(x1,y2)$. We activate $\phi$ on that box. Now here is the part I'm not sure of.. Because $f$ is bounded (and that f is not riemann integrable in this segment) we can take a $y_c$ so that $y_c$ is between $y1+f(x)$ and $y2+f(x)$ in a dense set of the segment $[x1,x2]$ and is not between those values in a different dense set in that segment. Now we see that the Upper darboux sum in that segment of $\mathbb{1}_{\phi(B)}(x,y_c)=1*(x2-x1)$
and the Lower darboux sum is 0. That would mean we found a box B where $\phi(B)$ is not admissible. And that proves it. This is what I answered in my test and I lost 30 out of 40 points on

Some of its conclusions are obvious: neither fully disconnected nor the complete structures have integrated information because it's ""too primitive"". Only intricate, multilevel structures may be related to consciousness. The procedure for calculating the measure of integrated information in IIT is enough complicated. I wondered what relatively simple well-known graph measures can be used to estimate integrated information. It is known that the number of edges of complete graph is  $n\cdot(n-1)/2$, so ""optimal"" structures should have number of edges not far from $n\cdot(n-1)/4$ But this tells us nothing about the internal structure of the graph, which can be quite different for the same number of edges. It seems that we should think about some graph clustering measure . But clustering coefficient shows a rather ambiguous results. So I have ""invented"" own measure which is very naive but shows more interesting results. Let $g$ is a connected subgraph of graph $G$ with $n_g$ edges (""internal links"") and $m_g$ - the number of edges connecting $g$ with $G\diagdown g$ (""external links"").
So my measure for clustering of $g$ is just $\varkappa=n_g/m_g$ My first question is: Is there already such a definition?
Does it make some nontrivial sense? At the moment, it is impossible for me to offer a measure of clustering all the graph based on $\varkappa$ for subgraphs. But (log) histograms of possible values $\varkappa$ for a given order of subgraphs look  interesting. Is there simple explanation for the specific form of the envelope of (log) histograms?

Let $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be the sequence so formed. In particular, this is a sequence in $K_1$ and thus has a convergent subsequence with limit $\hat{x} \in K_1$. Relabel this convergent subsequence as $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$. Now, there exists $k(j)$ so that $\{x_n\}_{n=k(j)}^{\infty} \subset K_j$, and again has a convergent subsequence that converges to $\hat{x} \in K_j$. Since this holds for any $j$, $$\hat{x} \in \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} K_i.$$ Since $V^c$ is closed, $\hat{x} \in V^c$, a contradiction.

1840639,"Relating the class number of a field, and of its normal closure","Suppose I take a number field $ K $, not necessarily Galois, with class number $ h_k $ (over $ \mathbb{Q} $).  Write $ \overline{K} $ for the normal closure of $ K $.  What, if anything, can be said about the relation between $ h_K $ and $ h_{\overline{K}} $?  A question dealing with one particular case of interest is presented at the end. In general I know there is no real relationship between the class number of a field $ E $, and of an extension $ F \supset E $.  Probably the best example of this is $ \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d}) $, with $ d $ squarefree.  We have that $ h_{\mathbb{Q}} = 1 $, but $ h_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})} \to \infty $ as $ d \to \infty $.  In particular there can be no upper bound on $ h_F $ as a function of only $ h_E $ and $ [F\colon E] $. However, from class field theory we do get the following observation.  Let $ H(E) $ denote the Hilbert class field of $ E $.  Then the fields $ E \subset F $ fit into the following diagram.
\begin{array}{cc}
& H(F) & \\ 
\quad \huge\diagup & {\huge|} h_{F} \\
H(E) & F \\
{\huge|} h_E & {\huge\diagup} [F\colon E] \\
E
\end{array}
We conclude that $ h_E \mid h_F [F \colon E] $.  But of course, in the previous case this tell us the trivial result that $ 1 \mid h_F [F \colon E] $.  Can anything more precise be said in the case $ K \subset \overline{K} $? Initially, I wondered/hoped if there was some bound like $ h_{\overline{K}} \mid [\overline{K}\colon K] h_k^{[\overline{K} \colon K]} $, but after some numerical experimentations with Magma, I find this doesn't hold.  For example with $ K = \mathbb{Q}(\theta) $, where $ \theta $ is a root of $ 2 + 7x + 2x^2 + 8x^3 $, we get that $ h_K = 2 $ and $ h_{\overline{K}} = 88 $.  Somehow a factor of 11 suddenly appears.  But maybe this has to do with the fact that the discriminant $ \Delta_{\overline{K}} $ contains a factor of 11? This open-ended question is motivated by a specific observation which occurred when I looked at the the pure cubic fields $ K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n}) $.  Here the situation seems more 'rigid'.  In this case $ \overline{K} = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n}, \sqrt{-3}) $, and in all cube-free cases from $ n = 1, \ldots, 1000 $, I seem to find that $ h_{\overline{K}} \mid h_K^2 $.  But moreover $$ h_K^2 / h_{\overline{K}} \in \{ 1, 3 \} \, . $$ Question: Is this true generally for $ K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n}) $ that $ h_{\overline{K}} \mid h_K^2 $?  Even more, do we have $ h_K^2 / h_{\overline{K}} \in \{ 1, 3 \} $.  If so, how can this be proven?  Is this a shadow of some more general result? Extra: If it is true that for $ K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n}) $, we have $ h_K^2 / h_{\overline{K}} \in \{ 1, 3 \} $.  Is there anything about $ n $, or $ K $, which lets us predict whether the case $ h_K^2 / h_{\overline{K}} = 1 $  occurs, or the case $ h_K^2 / h_{\overline{K}} = 3 $?","['number-theory', 'galois-theory', 'class-field-theory', 'ideal-class-group']"

The hint says to show that it would have to lie on a quadric surface. This is the part I'm having trouble with. If $X$ is the curve, then there's an exact sequence $$0 \to H^0(\mathcal{I}_X(2)) \to H^0(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(2)) \to H^0(\mathcal{O}_X(2)) \to \ldots$$ and I want $h^0(\mathcal{I}_X(2))$ to be nonzero, which would be true if $h^0(\mathcal{O}_X(2)) < h^0(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(2)) = 10$.

1840723,When is a 5th degree polynomial with at least 1 non-real root solvable by radicals?,"Let $f(X)$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree 5 with coefficents in the field of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$. Assume that $f$ has at least one non-real root in the complex field $\mathbb{C}$. Assume further that the discriminant of $f$ is a square in $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $r$ be a root of $f$, and let $K$ be the field $\mathbb{Q}(r)$, so that $f$ factors in $K[X]$ as $$f = (X − r)g$$ with $g$ of degree 4. Prove that $f$ is solvable by radicals if and only if $g$ is reducible in $K[X]$. My thoughts: I know that since the discriminant of $f$ is a square in $\mathbb{Q}$, $G\subset A_5,$ and since $f$ is irreducible, $G$ must be transitive. So we must have that either $G\cong A_5$ or $G\cong D_5$ (the dihedral group of order 10). Moreover, since char $\mathbb{Q}=0,$ we know that $f$ is solvable by radicals if and only if $G$ is solvable. Since $A_5$ is simple and non-abelian, $A_5$ is not solvable. On the other hand, $D_5$ is solvable: $D_5$ has an element $r$ with $r^5=e$, and $[D_5 : \left<r\right>]=2,$ so $\left<r\right>\triangleleft D_5.$ Now $$D_5\triangleright\left<r\right>\triangleright\{e\}.$$  So it suffices to show that $g$ is reducible in $K[X]$ if and only if $G\cong D_5.$ If $f$ has exactly 2 non-real roots, then the only nontrivial $\mathbb{Q}$-automorphism is complex conjugation, so $G$ contains a transposition, which implies $G\cong S_5$. Thus, $f$ must have exactly one real root and 4 non-real roots. This is where I'm stuck.

In each test, the inspector chooses a subset $\sigma\subset \{1,\ldots, n\}$ of the machines to be running, and measures their average efficiency $\frac{1}{|\sigma|}\sum_{i\in\sigma}X_i$. Each test costs the factory the same amount of money regardless of how many machines are running. Thus, it is in the factory's interest to reduce the number of tests to a minimum. Let's discuss some strategies for conducting the inspection. The most obvious strategy to conduct the inspection is to measure the machines one at a time (i.e. choosing consecutive singleton sets $\{i\}$, thus measuring the value $X_i$). Doing so requires $n$ tests to prove that all machines are in compliance. On the other hand, if one of the machines is not in compliance, the inspection has failed, and the inspector can stop testing. In some cases, testing multiple machines at once could allow the inspector to complete the inspection in fewer than $n$ tests. For example, measuring an average efficiency of $1$ while running all machines at once would reveal that all machines were individually running at efficiency $1$, thus completing the inspection in a single test. Similarly, measuring a total average efficiency below $\alpha$ would mean at least one machine's efficiency must be below $\alpha$, so the inspection would fail and terminate after only one test. Therefore, it may be advantageous to construct a strategy around multiple-machine tests, as they allow for the possibility of early termination. My questions are, In the general case, is there a strategy to conduct the inspection in fewer than $n$ tests that guarantees a correct answer? I suspect that the answer to the above is no. In particular, I think that there may be strategies other than one-by-one that guarantee a correct answer in $n$ tests, but none that will guarantee an answer in fewer than $n$ tests. The more general question, therefore, is... Suppose that the machine efficiencies $X_i$ are i.i.d. random variables distributed uniformly. What inspection strategy minimizes the expected number of tests required to guarantee a correct answer?","['probability-theory', 'decision-theory', 'operations-research', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics']"
1841067,Improper rotation matrix in $2D$,"The following is the related problem: Improper Rotations in Even Dimensions I want the simpler explanation. An improper rotation is rotation, followed by reflection in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Consider an improper rotation in $2D$: $$R_I=\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta  \\ \sin\theta   & -\cos\theta  \end{bmatrix} $$ Obviously, $\text {det}( R_I)=-1$. Consider the following simple case: $R_I\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta \\ \sin\theta   \end{bmatrix}$. However, this is the same as $R\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0  \end{bmatrix}$, where $R$ is the proper rotation matrix. $$R=\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta  \\ \sin\theta   & \cos\theta  \end{bmatrix}$$ $R_I\begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 1  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta \\ -\cos\theta    \end{bmatrix}$. and $R\begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 1  \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} -\sin\theta  \\ \cos\theta   \end{bmatrix}$.

1841098,"How are sets ""detached"" from their structure?","This question is best asked with an example. Consider the real numbers. However we construct the real numbers, the ""final product"" so to speak, is not just a set, but it is a complete ordered field. In other words, it's not just $\mathbb{R}$ but $(\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot, \leq)$. This gives me a sense that the structure associated with $\mathbb{R}$ is intrinsic to it. Yet it isn't; we're free to change the structure however we want. Now, the way I reconcile this (and I may even be answering my own question!) is that a set is defined by the membership relationship $\in$ and only that. Thus, after constructing $(\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot, \leq)$ (via dedekind, cauchy, whatever), if $x$ is a member of this ordered field that we've created, we define a corresponding set $\mathbb{R}$ such that set theoretically $\mathbb{R} = (\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot, \leq)$ but we don't equip this set with any structure. Even if this is right, it just feels weird to me and I would like a better or simpler explanation. How exactly does a set with an underlying structure ""precede"" the set without any structure? It seems ""unnatural"" in a sense. It's as if the very existence of the reals as a set is contingent on their (standard) ordering and field properties.","['real-numbers', 'elementary-set-theory']"
1841193,Monotone Class Theorem and another similar theorem.,"I found different statements of the Monotone Class Theorem.
On probability Essentials (Jean Jacod and Philip Protter) the Monotone Class Theorem (Theorem 6.2, page 36) is stated as follows: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a class of subsets of $\Omega$ under finite intersections and containing $\Omega$. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the smallest class containing $\mathcal{C}$ which is closed under increasing limits and by difference. Then $\mathcal{B} = \sigma ( \mathcal{C})$. While on Wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_class_theorem ) the theorem is: Let $G$ be an algebra of sets and define $M(G)$ to be the smallest monotone class containing $G$. Then $M(G)$ is precisely the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $G$, i.e. $\sigma(G) = M(G)$. Where a monotone class in a set $R$ is a collection $M$ of subsets of $R$ which contains $R$ and is closed under countable monotone unions and intersections. It looks like the second theorem should be a special case of the first. Does the first prove the second? Is it possible to prove the first from the second?

1841366,Probability that a clumsy boy eats $k$ out of 20 candies,"A week or two (or maybe more) ago, the following question was posted and then deleted just as I was getting to the end of my solution. Unfortunately I have now forgotten what my solution was going to be. I don't think the OP reposted it, so here is a slight variant of it. A boy has 20 candies in his hand. He eats them one at a time, but each
  time he puts one in his mouth there is a chance he drops one of those
  remaining in his hand. That chance is $0.04n$ where $n$ is the number
  remaining (and independent of everything else). So after eating the
  first candy there is a 0.76 chance that he is left with only 18
  candies in his hand. He never picks up dropped candies. Find the
  probability that he ends up eating $k$ of the candies. Part of the fun is the elegance or otherwise of the solution. The series one needs to sum with a plodding approach is not difficult, there is just a (fairly obvious) trap for the overhasty. But it would be good to think of a more elegant approach. I am snowed under with work today, but will try to reconstruct my solution and post it as an answer tomorrow (I am on GMT+1, ie 5 hours ahead of EDT. I hope that is the correct jargon for time in NY.). Oh, I nice plot always helps. A solution for the general case (replacing 0.04 by a constant $p=\frac{1}{M}$, where $M\ge N$, and 20 by $N$) and any resulting rules of thumb for what was needed for him to eat at least half or whatever would be good too. The more sophisticated could rattle off the related inference problem: assuming your prior belief is that $p$ is uniformly distributed over (1) $[0,1]$, (2) $[0,0.1]$, (3) $[0.9,1]$ (three separate cases) and you observe that he drops $k$, then what is the posterior distribution for $p$? BTW, aged 66, I don't tend to get given homework. :) And I don't mind solutions with a software element, provided there is an adequate explanation. Also I have put together three questions of varying difficulty because they are so closely related. So to be clear, I would welcome solutions covering just one of (1) the basic problem (first yellow background above) with 20 candies and $p=0.04$, (2) the more general case with $N$ candies and $p=\frac{1}{M}$, and (3) the inference question (the second yellow background).","['bayesian', 'probability', 'statistical-inference', 'discrete-mathematics']"
