1578173,Calculating chance level accuracy,"I have the following problem from computational neuroscience (presented here if you are interested in the main source): For 126 subjects, the brain activity in 268 regions of the brain is measured (one time series per region). Then a correlation matrix is computed out of this measured time series (i.e. a symmetric 268 * 268 matrix). The same thing is done on two days, so we have 2 such matrices for each subject. Now, we take iteratively one matrix of one particular subject from day 1 (""target matrix""), and compute the correlation between this matrix and all the 126 matrices of day 2. The highest correlation value between the target matrix and the matrices of day 2 is used to identify the matrix from day 2 which belongs to the same subject who's correlation matrix (from day 1) we are using as the ""target matrix"".This process is done 126 times (i.e. at each iteration, another person's day 1 matrix is used as the target matrix). I have the two following questions now: (1) Are these trials (finding the subject from the target matrix also on day 2) dependent from each other? If so, why? (2) How can we calculate chance level accuracy, i.e. if it would be pure guessing to pick out the correct matrix from day 2, what number of correct guesses can we expect? Is there any way to determine that? Thanks","['matrices', 'statistics']"
1578199,Haar functions form a complete orthonormal system,"I want to show that the Haar functions in $L^2([0,1])$ forms an orthonormal basis: Let $$f = 1_{[0, 1/2)} - 1_{[1/2,0)} \ \ \mbox{,} \ \ f_{j,k}(t) = 2^{j/2}f(2^jt - k).$$
Let $\mathscr{A} = \{(j.k) : j \geq 0, k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2^j -1\}.$ I can prove that $\ A := \{1_{[0,1]}\} \cup \{f_{j,k}: (j,k) \in \mathscr{A}\}$ is an orthonormal system in $L^2([0,1])$. (using the fact that each of them is supported on $[2^{-j}k, 2^{-j}(k+1))$, and each different pairs $i, j$ either has disjoint support or contained in each other support) I want to show that $A$ is complete. Let $g \in L^2([0,1])$ with $\left<g,f_{i,j}\right> = 0$ and $\left<g, 1_{[0,1]}\right> = 0$ for all $(i, j) \in A.$ I will show that $g = 0 $ a.e.

1578316,Why is an embedding an injective immersion?,"My course on manifolds defines an embedding as follows: 'A smooth map $f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{N}$ between manifolds $\mathcal{M}$ of dimension $m$ and $\mathcal{N}$ of dimension $n$ is an embedding if it is a diffeomorphism onto its range. We refer to the range, $f(\mathcal{M})$, of such a map, as a submanifold of $\mathcal{N}$.' Below the definition, it states 'clearly, any embedding is an injective immersion', but I am struggling to see why this is. Injectivity follows from the fact that any diffeomorphism is bijective, but why does the immersion part follow? Why does $f$ being a diffeomorphism onto its range imply that the derivative $d_xf$ is injective for all $x\in\mathcal{M}$? Is it to do with $d_xf$ having a left inverse? I've tried to consider a dimension argument but this has got me even more confused, so I have a second question: we view the $d_xf$ as a linear map from $T_x\mathcal{M}$ to $T_{f(x)}\mathcal{N}$, which can be represented as an $n\times{m}$ matrix since the dimension of a tangent space is equal to the dimension of its corresponding manifold. But couldn't we equally view $d_xf$ as a linear map from $T_x\mathcal{M}$ to $T_{f(x)}f(\mathcal{M})$? This can then be represented as an $m\times{m}$ matrix, since the dimension of $f(\mathcal{M})$ is equal to the dimension of $\mathcal{M}$ (diffeomorphisms preserve dimension?). Which is the correct way to look at it?","['manifolds', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

I know how to compute the inverse if it exists, and using the same method in this case gives me $[x^2]^{-1} = x^2$, but I don't know how to tell if that is an inverse or not. I know that an element multiplied by its inverse should yield the identity element, but I'm not sure what the identity element in these situations is. What I know is that an identity element leaves the other elements unchanged, so in $\mathbb{Z}$, that would be $1$. My intuition tells me $x^2$ does not leave every element in $R$ unchanged, but I don't know how to show that.","['polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'modular-arithmetic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

The primitive element theorem says there is an element $x$ in $\mathbb{k}(X)$ such that $\mathbb{k}(X)(x) = \mathbb{k}(Y)$. Now, if you think of $x$ itself as a map $X \to \mathbb{P}^1$ then $x$ has a degree, lets call it $h$. My question is whether or not anything is known about how small $h$ can be. I am reading a paper that randomly throws in that $h<r-1$, and I can come up with examples where this is possible but in general I think not. Can a primitive element always be found with small enough degree or is this probably a condition that he is imposing?","['field-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1578437,One-to-one to prove onto,"I stumbled across a problem where I have to prove that a given function is one-to-one and onto. This is part (b) of problem 22 in chapter 7 of Velleman's How to Prove It, 2nd edition. It asks the reader to show that the set of all total orders on a finite set A with n elements, call this set $L$, is equinumerous with the set of all one-to-one, onto functions from $I_n$ to A ($I_n = \{ i \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} | i \le n$ }), call this set $F$. I tried to follow the hint that comes at the end of the book but hit bedrock when trying to prove that the function $g:A \rightarrow I_n$ defined as $g(a) = |\{ x \in A|xRa \}|$ is onto. Here goes the hint provided: Define $h:F \rightarrow L$ by the formula $h(f) = \{(a, b) ∈ A ×
A | f^{−1}(a) \le f^{−1}(b)\}$. To see that h is one-to-one, suppose that $f \in F$, $g \in F$, and $f \neq g$. Let $i$ be the smallest element of $I_n$ for which $f(i) \neq g(i)$. Now show that $(f(i), g(i)) \in h(f)$ but $(f(i), g(i)) \notin h(g)$, so $h(f) \neq h(g)$. To see that h is onto, suppose $R$ is a total order on A. Define $g: A \rightarrow I_n$ by the formula $g(a) = |\{ x \in A|xRa \}|$. Show that $\forall a \in A \forall b \in A(aRb \iff g(a) \le g(b))$, and use this fact to show that $g^{−1} \in F$ and $h(g^{−1}) = R$. My line of thought: I have to prove that $g^{−1} \in F$, or alternatively $g$ is a one-to-one function from $A$ onto $I_n$. Using the hint, I managed to show that $g$ is one-to-one. As for $g$ being onto, I think I could use the following facts: 1 ) From the (already proven) fact that $g$ is one-to-one, we have that $\forall a \in A \forall b \in A(a \neq b \Rightarrow g(a) \neq g(b))$. 2 ) Clearly, $1 \le g(a) \le n$, or $g(a) \in I_n$. With these facts I think it can be shown that $\forall i \in I_n \exists a \in A (g(a)  = i)$. Curiously, this argument uses the fact that $g$ is one-to-one to prove that the $g$ is onto, and I think this is very odd! Anyway, this seems to me too cumbersome. There must be an easier way to prove that $g$ is onto... Any advice is very much appreciated!",['functions']

It looks like we need to use theorem 5.2.8 (Martingale convergence theorem), which states that $X_n$ converges almost surely if $\sup EX_n^+<\infty$. I am trying to understand why we can just do the following (or at least I'm guessing we can't): Suppose $X_n > 0$ (edit: on some set with positive measure), then $0< \sup X_n < \infty$, and therefore $EX_n^+ \le \sup X_n < \infty$. So we're done. Otherwise, if $X_n \le 0$ a.e., then $\sup X_n^+ = 0$ a.e. Once again, we're done. Am I missing something? Since I didn't use all the information, I probably am.

1578568,Intuitive explanation why complex differentiation is not linear over real and imaginary part,"Suppose we have a complex valued function $f = u + iv \colon U \to \mathbb C$ defined on an open subset $U$ of $\mathbb C$, which is holomorphic.

$$
\frac{d}{dz} f(z) = \frac{d}{dz} (u(z) + iv(z)) = \frac{d}{dz} u(z) + i \frac{d}{dz} v(z).
$$
I explained this by proving that a real - valued function that is holomorphic must be constant, and so for $\frac{d}{dz} u$ and $\frac{d}{dz} v$ to exist $u$ and $v$ must be constant in $z$. However $f$ is not necessarily constant so applying the linearity in this way is invalid. I also showed that the real - and imaginary part functions $\Re()$ and $\Im()$ are not holomorphic. Intuitively I think that real - valued and complex - valued functions are a different 'thing' and the $\frac{d}{dz}$ operator lives in the 'complex analysis world', so even though it is linear over complex functions it does not make sense to use it in the context of real - valued functions.

(I am able to generalise this to $\Lambda^n(V)$ via $\widetilde J: \Lambda^{n-1}(V) \to V^\ast, \sigma \mapsto \omega(\sigma \wedge \cdot)$ and Hodge dual) The way Burago/Ivanov use the ""isometry""-part in their paper is $\left|J(v) \wedge J(v')\right| = \left|v \wedge v'\right|$ though (where the norms are on the respective exterior powers). Is there a relationship between the induced norm on the exterior power and a corresponding volume form?

Prove that $|f'(x)|\leq\sqrt{2MM''},\forall x\in\mathbb{R}$ I am thinking about using Taylor's theorem:
For any $x\in\mathbb{R}$ and $a>0$, by Taylor's theorem $\exists \xi\in(x,x+a)$ s.t.
$$f(x+a)=f(x)+f'(x)a+\frac{f''(\xi)}{2}a^2$$
Thus
$$|f'(x)|\leq\frac{|f(x)|+|f(x+a)|}{a}+\frac{|f''(\xi)|}{2}a$$
However with this approach the best bound we can get is
$$|f'(x)|\leq 2\sqrt{MM''}$$

For example, the altitude $a$ of an equilateral triangle coincides with a median $m$ of the triangle.  Each point of one figure is in the same place as some point of the other figure. The idea is not just that one figure is congruent with another, since congruent figures can be in different places. Also, the idea is not just that a figure with one name is identical to itself under a different name, as if a point is used in one figure, two figures, a 1000 figures, or no figures, and the differences among those names are insignificant.  We say that figures are coincident when they are understood independently from one another and seem to be able to exist without each other.  We are often surprised when we discover they they in fact coincide. In set notation, we would say $A=B$, if $A$ is the set of all points in one figure and $B$ is the set of all points in the other figure, but I prefer to avoid set theory.

Prove that this slicing is fair for $n \neq 2$ even  but for $n$ odd or $n=2$ it isn't  . After seeing the problem I tried it for other pizza shapes also . I observed that the square quickly failed (for two cuts ) and this made me realize that the pizza should be quite 'round'. Based on this I conjectured the following : Consider a closed convex set as the 'shape' of the pizza .Also choose $n$ a fixed positive integer .Take an arbitrary point on the pizza and then make $n$ cuts through it with angles $\frac{\pi}{n}$ between them . The friends take the slices alternatively in a clock-wise way. Assume that the friends always get the same amount of pizza for every point on the pizza and any first cut .

This isn't hard either . Draw a point close enough to the vertex with the acute angle (or right angle) . Draw a cut parallel with one of the sides of the angle and the other cut perpendicular to it .

Anyway, on page 14 of Concrete Mathematics, the author has just finished going over the Josephus problem: Josephus $$ J(1) = 1;$$
$$ J(2n) = 2J(n) - 1;$$
$$ J(2n + 1) = 2J(n) + 1 $$ He then derives a more closed form (as I understand it) representation of $J(n)$, being: $$ J(2^m + l) = 2l + 1$$ where, $$0 \le l < 2^m; n = 2^m + l, \text{for} \space n \ge 1$$ In general, for each version of $J$, he defines three corresponding constants: $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$: Recurrence 1.11 (as per the book) Let $f(n)$ represent the general form of $J(n)$: $$ f(1) = \alpha $$
$$ f(2n) = 2f(n) + \beta$$
$$ f(2n + 1) = 2f(n) + \gamma$$ Where  $J(n) \implies (\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = (1, -1, 1)$ He then derives a hypothesis, which involves this form of $f(n)$: $$f(n) = \alpha A(n) + \beta B(n) + \gamma C(n)$$ where, $$ A(n) = 2^m$$
$$ B(n) = 2^m - 1 - l$$
$$ C(n) = l$$ So, he begins his proof by ""choosing particular values and combining them"";
notably, he selects the constants $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = (1, 0, 0)$. This implies that $f(n) = A(n)$. The result yields the following: $$ A(1) = 1; $$
$$ A(2n) = 2A(n), \text{for} \space n \ge 1 $$
$$ A(2n + 1) = 2A(n), \text{for} \space n \ge 1 $$ My confusion stems from the fact that, all of a sudden, we're mapping
$A(2n + 1) = 2A(n)$, with a 1 getting eaten by the function... How is it that $A(2n + 1) = A(2n) = 2A(n)$? Are these implying that $$ A(2n + 1) = 2A(n) + 1\gamma$$ with $\gamma = 0$?","['proof-explanation', 'computer-science', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Is the problem maybe stated wrong? To say that $L_T$ is indeed the required density $\frac{d \mathbb Q}{d \mathbb P}$ , I think we need to use the converse of the Girsanov Theorem (or here ), or maybe the problem should instead give us $\frac{d \mathbb Q}{d \mathbb P}$ and then ask us to show that $L_T = \frac{d \mathbb Q}{d \mathbb P}$ possibly showing that $E[\frac{d \mathbb Q}{d \mathbb P} | \mathscr F_t] = L_t$ or some other route. I tried something slightly different: I define $\hat{\mathbb P}$ s.t. $$L_T = \frac{d\hat{\mathbb P}}{d\mathbb P}$$ or $$\hat{\mathbb P} = \int_A L_T d\mathbb P$$ It follows by Girsanov Theorem that $X_t$ is standard $\hat{\mathbb P}$ -Brownian motion. Since we are given that there is some $\mathbb Q$ equivalent to $\mathbb P$ s.t. $X_t$ is also standard $\mathbb Q$ -Brownian motion, it follows by the uniqueness of the Radon-Nikodym derivative that $$\frac{d\hat{\mathbb P}}{d\mathbb P} = \frac{d\mathbb Q}{d\mathbb P}$$ $\therefore, \frac{d\mathbb Q}{d\mathbb P}$ is given by $L_T$ . Is that right? I think I'm missing a step somewhere. So, is that indeed what the solution given is meant to be but just omitted pointing out uniqueness of the Radon-Nikodym derivative, if such justification is right? Edit based on comment below and this : Even if Radon-Nikodym derivative is unique, $\mathbb Q$ may not be unique? If so, is it then that $\hat{\mathbb P}$ is merely a candidate for one of many possible $\mathbb Q$ 's? I think we conclude $\hat{\mathbb P} = \mathbb Q$ based on $X_t$ being standard Brownian motion under both measures. Is there a proposition for that?

$$ I recently learned that stochastic differential equations (SDEs) had a whole lot of theory behind them and I am genuinely surprised at the complexity that a ""simple"" noise term seems to introduce in the numerical strategies employed to solve such equations. I found this paper by D.Higham very instructive, and learned about Ito and Stratonovich frameworks for SDEs, but I don't understand how to get started on my own set of equations. My system is of the form: $$
\deriv{X_k} = -X_k + f\left( \sum_i \alpha_{i,k} X_i + \eta \right)
$$
where $\alpha_{i,j}$ are real constants, $f$ is a smooth non-linear function and $\eta$ is normally distributed. From Higham's paper, I assume that the ""Stochastic Chain Rule"" would be relevant here, but it is unclear to me how to reduce this set of equations to an Ito or any other suitable form. Most numerical solvers I encountered so far require an Ito form, but clearly here the noise term is not directly additive. I don't know how to go about integrating this system with noise. Without noise, I was using a simple Runge-Kutta 4 method but from what I read I assume that ""adapting"" this with noise is not going to be straightforward at all? EDIT: Based on the recommendations of @LutzL, a sensible approach seems to be as follows: Define the non-linear feedback term 
$$Z_k = \sum_i \alpha_{i,k} X_i + \eta$$ 
the differential of which is 
$$d Z_k = \sum_i \alpha_{i,k} d X_i + \sigma_k d W_k$$ We know from the original equation that
$$d X_k = ( -X_k + f(Z_k) )dt$$
so we can rewrite
$$d Z_k = \sum_i \alpha_{i,k} ( f(Z_k)-X_k )dt + \sigma_k d W_k$$ These equations are now in Ito form and can be solved using e.g. an Euler-Maruyama method. Note that if we started off with a system of $N$ equations, the resulting Ito form now comprises $2N$ equations. Questions that persist for me are: @LutzL mentioned that the noise timestep $\Delta t$ has to be larger than the solver's time-step ; in practice this causes the noise time-course to have unexpected spectral properties (ie, a sub-sampled white-noise is no longer white). Why is this necessary? Is there a reference in the literature about this specific problem? Is it ok to use a mixed method, Euler-Maruyama for $Z_k$, and RK4 for $X_k$? If so, should intermediary steps of $X_k$ each sample a value of $Z_k$, or should there be only one sample of $Z_k$ for all intermediary steps?","['numerical-methods', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'stochastic-differential-equations', 'stochastic-integrals']"

1579477,inverse Laplace transform by finding residues of essential singularities,"I want to find the inverse Laplace transform of $$F(s)=\exp\Big(-\sqrt{2s}\tanh(\sqrt{2s})\Big).$$ Despite the square roots, $F$ doesn't have any branch points since $$\sqrt{2s}\tanh(\sqrt{2s})=\frac{\sqrt{2s}\sinh(\sqrt{2s})}{\cosh(\sqrt{2s})}$$ and both the numerator and denominator are seen to be holomorphic by looking at their power series. Hence there are only isolated essential singularities at the zeros of $\cosh(\sqrt{2s})$, namely $$s=-\frac{\pi^2}{8},-\frac{9\pi^2}{8},-\frac{25\pi^2}{8},...$$ Assuming that we have sufficient decay of the modulus of $F$ away from the singularities in the left half-plane, we can use the residue theorem to write the inverse Laplace transform of $F$ as $$f(t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\exp\Big(-\frac{(2n-1)^2\pi^2}{8}t\Big)Res\Big(F,-\frac{(2n-1)^2\pi^2}{8}\Big)$$ where $Res\Big(F,-\frac{(2n-1)^2\pi^2}{8}\Big)$ is the residue of $F$ at the essential singularity $-\frac{(2n-1)^2\pi^2}{8}$.
