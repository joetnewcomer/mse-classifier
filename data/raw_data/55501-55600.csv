599851,"Properties of ""membership relation"" in naive set theory","I'm reading Devlin, Fundamentals of contemporary set theory , I am at page 13: Definition Let $R$ denote any binary relation on a set $x$. We say: $R$ is reflexive if $(\forall a\in x) (aRa)$ $R$ is symmetric if $(\forall a,b\in x) (aRb\rightarrow bRa)$ $R$ is antisymmetric if $(\forall a,b\in x) [(aRb \wedge a\neq b)\rightarrow (\neg bRa)]$ $R$ is connected if $(\forall a,b\in x)[(a\neq b)\rightarrow (aRb \vee bRa)]$ $R$ is transitive if $(\forall a,b,c\in x)[(aRb \wedge bRc)\rightarrow (aRc)]$. Excercise : Which of the above properties does the membership relation, $\in$, on a set satisfy? My answer is NONE.

Motivation. Let $A$ and $X$ denote sets. Suppose $\circ : A^2 \rightarrow A$ is associative, $f : X \rightarrow A$ is injective, and that the image of $f$ is left-closed under $\circ$. Then there exists a unique operation $* : A \times X \rightarrow X$ satisfying $$f(a * x) = a \circ f(x).$$ Furthermore, it necessarily has the property that: $$a * (b * x) = (a \circ b) * x.$$ I ask myself: does there exist a pair of operations $* : A \times X \rightarrow X$ and $\circ : A \times A \rightarrow A$ satisfying the above identity, such that no injection $f : X \rightarrow X$ whose image is left-closed under $\circ$ has the property that $f(a * x) = a \circ f(x)$?

600090,Tangent sheaf of the Picard scheme,"Let $X\overset{f}\to S$ be a flat morphism of schemes, and $S=\operatorname{Spec}(k)$ for an algebraically closed field $k=\bar{k}$. I'm just interested, for the moment, with schemes $X$ corresponding to smooth projective curves. Assume the functors $\operatorname{Div}_{X/S}^d$, and $\operatorname{Pic}_{X/S}^d$ are representable, and let $X_d$ and $W_d$ denote the respective representing schemes (for a definition of the functors see for example "" Kleiman - The Picard scheme "" at pages 17 and 23, but I don't think it's crucial for the following). I derived (using known facts) a description of the tangent sheaf of the $d$-component of the Picard scheme $W_d$. However, I don't feel very confident with the technical machinery of algebraic geometry, so my proof is probably not completely correct. Could you please give it a look? Any help/comment/suggestion would be incredibly appreciated! Proposition: Let $\pi:X\times X_d \to X_d$ the natural projection and $u:X_d\to W_d$ the Abel Jacobi map on degree $d$. Then the sheaves over $X_d$
  $$ u^* T_\bullet W_d \quad\text{and}\quad R^1 \pi_* \mathcal{O}_{X\times X_d} $$
  are isomorphic, and they coincide with the constant sheaf over $X_d$ with fibers $H^1(\mathcal{O}_X)$. References used in the proof (for basic results you probably already know): $[BLR]$ $=$ Bosch, Lutkebohmert, and Raynaud - Neron Models $[HART]$ $=$ Robin  Hartshorne - Algebraic Geometry Proof: First of all we notice that we have isomorphisms
$$ T_0 \operatorname{Pic}_{X/S} \cong R^1f_* \mathcal{O}_X \cong H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X),$$
where the first one is the content of Theorem 1 of $[BLR]$, and the second one follows from the obvious identity of functors $f_*\square \equiv \Gamma(X,\square)$. Since $\operatorname{Pic}_{X/S}$ is a group variety its tangent sheaf is constant with fibers $T_0\operatorname{Pic}_{X/S} \cong H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$. The same is true if we restrict to the subscheme $W_d$: The tangent sheaf $ T_\bullet W_d $ is the constant sheaf with fibers $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ over $W_d$. Actually, also $R^1 \pi_* \mathcal{O}_{X\times X_d}$ is constant with fibers $H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$. To see this consider the fiber diagram and apply Proposition 9.3 (page 255) of $[HART]$ to the structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$. We get
$$ R^1 \pi_* \mathcal{O}_{X\times X_d} \cong g^* \left( R^1f_*\mathcal{O}_X \right) \cong  g^* H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X), $$
from which we deduce that $R^1 \pi_* \mathcal{O}_{X\times X_d}$ is the constant sheaf on $X_d$ with fibers $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$. To conclude it's enough to notice that $u: X_d \to W_d$ is a surjective map of schemes, so from the above description of $T_\bullet W_d$ and $R^1 \pi_* \mathcal{O}_{X\times X_d}$ as constant sheaves it follows that
$$ u^* T_\bullet W_d \cong R^1 \pi_* \mathcal{O}_{X\times X_d}. $$","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'proof-verification', 'algebraic-curves']"

600226,"Higher order differential on a manifold, connections","I am trying to understand how to define the second order differential of a map $f : M \rightarrow N$ between smooth manifolds. I came across this exact same question : Higher-order derivatives in manifolds The answers in the comments pointed towards jets, which I didn't know and shall learn about.I also thought that there should be a link with covariant derivatives : if you have a given covariant derivative on $M$, say the Levi-Civita connection of a certain Riemannian metric, isn't there any standard way to define higher order differentials, in a way that would yield a Taylor formula ? Or are jets really the only good way to look at these things ? Any comment or reference appreciated.
I know this is almost a duplicate (almost because I am asking also about the link with covariant derivatives, if there is one) but the original question seems inactive, so... EDIT : As I suspected, a torsion-free covariant derivative $\nabla$ allows one to define the second order differential. Indeed, a covariant derivative $\nabla$ allows one to differentiate not only sections of $TM$ (ie vector fields) but also sections of 
$TM^{\otimes p} \otimes T^*M^{\otimes q}$ along vector fields. 
So the second order differential of a function $f : M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is defined by
$$\mathrm{Hess}(f) = \nabla df$$
and it is a section of $S^2 T^*M$.

600333,How to rigorously prove that these two sets have different order types?,"Let $A$ and $B$ be two given ordered sets with the linear (or total) order relations $<_A$ and $<_B$, respectively. Then $(A,<_A)$ and $(B,<_B)$ are said to be of the same type if there exists a bijection $f \colon A \to B$ such that $a_1 <_A a_2$ implies that $f(a_1) <_B f(a_2)$ for any pair of elements $a_1$, $a_2$ of $A$. Furthermore, the dictionary, or lexicographical, order $<_L$ on the Cartesian product  $A\times B$ is defined as follows: $a_1 \times b_1 <_L a_2 \times b_2$ if and only if the following holds: Either $a_1 <_A a_2$, or $a_1 =a_2 $ and $b_1 <_B b_2$. Now let's consider the two sets  $Z^+ \times [0,1)$ and  $ [0,1) \times Z^+$, where $Z^+$ denotes the set of positive integers and $[0,1)$ denotes the set of all non-negative reals less than $1$, both under the usual order. Let us give both these Cartesian products the dictionary, or lexicographical, order. Then how to rigorously prove, using the above definition, that these two sets have different order types? I know that the set $Z^+ \times [0,1)$ has the same order type as the set of 
non-negative real numbers under the usual order, for we can define the map $ f \colon Z^+ \times [0,1) \to [0,+\infty)$ as $$f(n\times t) \colon = n + t - 1$$ for all $n \in Z^+$ and all $t \in [0,1)$. This map is an order-preserving bijection. I also know that every element $t \times n$ of the set $[0,1) \times Z^+$ has an immediate successor, namely the element $t \times (n+1)$. However, this is not the case for the set $Z^+ \times [0,1)$, for if we take any two elements of this set, say, $n_1 \times t_1$ and $n_2 \times t_2$ such that $n_1 \times t_1 <_L n_2 \times t_2$, then either $n_1 < n_2$, or $n_1 = n_2$ and $t_1 < t_2$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are positive integers and $t_1$ and $t_2$ are real numbers in the interval $[0,1)$. If $n_1 < n_2$, then the element $n_1 \times (t_1 +1)/2$, for example, satisfies $n_1 \times t_1 <_L n_1 \times (t_1+1)/2$ and $n_1 \times (t_1 +1)/2 <_L n_2 \times t_2$. In fact, an element of the form $n_1 \times (\alpha t_1 + 1 -\alpha)$ or $n_2 \times (\alpha t_2)$ would do, where $0 < \alpha <1$. Similarly, if $n_1 = n = n_2$  and $t_1 < t_2$, then the element $n \times (\alpha t_1 + (1 - \alpha) t_2 )$, where $0 < \alpha < 1$ as before, satisfies $n_1 \times t_1 <_L n \times (\alpha t_1 + (1 - \alpha) t_2 )$ and $n \times (\alpha t_1 + (1 - \alpha) t_2 ) <_L n_2 \times t_2$. Thus we have shown that between any two distinct elements of the set $Z^+ \times [0,1)$, there is another element of $Z^+ \times [0,1)$, in fact there are infinitley many elements.","['general-topology', 'order-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'analysis']"

For the upper hemisphere and lower hemisphere its well-known that bundles over this spaces is trivial. (Any bundle over a contractible base is trivial). So to prove the fact that
line bundle over $S^2$ is trivial we must create continuation of trivialization from upper hemisphere (for example) to the lower hemisphere through ""border"" $[-\epsilon,\epsilon]\times S^1$.

which can be found here Symmetry and Integration In this paper it is shown that 
$$  
  \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{1 + \tan(x)^{\sqrt{2}}}
$$
Takes up exactly half of the area of the rectangle with base $\pi/2$
and height $1$. This idea is supported geometrically by a very convincing figure.
The argument was also done mathematically by noting that if 
$$ f(x) + f(a+b-x)$$
happens to be a constant, then one can proceed as above. I wanted to find an counter intuitive example where it would be misleading to look at the figure. The integral I found was an elliptic one, namely
$$
   A = \int_0^{\pi/2} \sqrt{1 + \cos^2 x} \mathrm{d}x \approx 1.9100
$$
Which when drawn looks something like The image is very suggestive into thinking that the area of the figure should be
$$
  \tilde{A} = \frac{\pi}{4}\bigl( 1 + \sqrt{2}\bigr) \approx 1.8961
$$
Where only the formula for the trapezoid was used. This idea is wrong since clearly
$1.9100 > 1.8961$. Mathematically one can argue by looking at $f(x) + f(a+b-x)$ one sees that
$$
 f(x) + f(\pi/2-x) = \sqrt{1+\cos^2x} + \sqrt{1+\sin^2x}
$$
it is not constant. The function wobbles very slightly between $1+\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{6}$. This proves that the function $\sqrt{1+\cos^2x}$
does not have the symmetric properties one thought it had. Using the same argument on $\sin^2x$ or $\cos^2x$ on $\pi/2$ 
shows that $f(x)+f(\pi/2-x)=1$, and hence the function ""fills""
exacly half of the square with base $\pi/2$ and height $1$. My question about this problem is two fold: What is it in the elliptic function that breaks the symmetry?
Clearly it is not the trigonometric part. Why is the integral bigger than the ""expected"" value? I can use Romberg, Trapezoid or any numerical integration method to evaluate the elliptic integral.

600655,Final-segment and finite-closed topology?,"Suppose N is the set of all positive integers and t consists of N, the empty set, and every set { n, n+1, ... } for n any positive integer. This is a topology and is called the “final segment topology.” Is it the finite-closed topology? The finite-closed topology contains X (the ""whole set""), the empty set, and all sets that have finite complements. These complements are the ONLY closed sets. At first, I thought the answer is “yes.” I reasoned like this: If n = 1, then the “final segment” formed is N. If n = 4 (for example), then the complement is { 1, 2, 3 } which is a finite set, so all these “final segments” belong to this topology. There are other finite subsets, such as { 2, 4, 6 }, but they will be neither open nor closed, since they are not the complement of any “final segment” set. After more thought, I changed my mind.  Here's my new reason: consider a singleton set in N such as { 3 }.  It is finite, and its complement in N is infinite, so it is a closed set in the ""finite closed"" topology.  It's complement is { 1 , 2, 4 , 5 ... } which is open in the ""finite closed"" topology, but it is not a ""final segment,"" so it's not open in the ""final segment"" topology.  If I'm right, this means the two topologies have different set of open sets, and so are different. Am I right about that?  Thanks.  R",['general-topology']

Prove: Let $f$ be a continuous function on the closed unit disc with two properties: 1. $f$ is the identity on the boundary, i.e., on the unit circle. That is, if $|z| = 1$, then $f(z) = z$. 2. $f^2$ is the identity, i.e., for all $z$ in the closed unit disc, we have $f(f(z)) = z$. Then $f$ must be the identity function.

It seemed to me like considering the two-dimensional case might be a good place to start in trying to tackle the problem there. Ultimately, the MO question was resolved using some nontrivial results.

The derivative of $f$ at $p$ is the map from the tangent space $T_pS^{n-1}$ to the tangent space $T_{f(p)}S^{n-1}=T_{-p}S^{n-1}$. It takes the vector $(p,v(p))$ to the vector $(-p,Df(p)\cdot v(p))$.

\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + y = \epsilon \bigg(\frac{dy}{dt} - \frac{1}{3}\bigg(\frac{dy}{dt}\bigg)^3\bigg). 
\end{equation} If I plug in the perturbation series \begin{equation}
y = y_0 + \epsilon y_1 + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2),
\end{equation} and solve for the $y_n$ order by order, I get $y_0 = Ae^{it}$ + complex conjugate, and, courtesy of Mathematica, \begin{equation}
y_1 = \alpha e^{it} + \beta t e^{it} + \gamma e^{3it} + \text{complex conjugate},

\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{iA}{4}\big(1 - A\bar{A}) + C,

\begin{equation}
\beta = \frac{A}{2}\big(1 - A\bar{A}\big),

and
\begin{equation}
\gamma = -\frac{iA^3}{24}.
\end{equation} PROBLEM:  I'm having difficulty matching boundary conditions.  Say my initial conditions are $y(0) = y0$ and $dy/dt(0) = \text{v}0$.  I believe that in order for my series solution to be valid for all $\epsilon$, I must have $y_0(0) = y0$, $dy_0/dt(0) = \text{v}0$, and $y_n(0) = 0$ and $dy_n/dt(0) = 0$ for all $n \ge 1$. QUESTION 1:  Is that true in general for perturbation series?  i.e. that $y_n(0) = 0$ and $dy_n/dt(0) = 0$ for all $n \ge 1$? QUESTION 2:  When I go to match $y_1(0) = 0$, I seem to require that $\alpha + \gamma = 0$, so $C$ should be whatever makes $\alpha = iA^3/24$.  But this seems to mean that I have used my first boundary condition ($y_1(0) = 0$) to determine both the real and imaginary parts of $C$.  In particular, I have not used the condition $dy_1/dt(0) = 0$ to help set C, and as one might expect, the resulting solution
\begin{equation}
y_1 = \frac{iA^3}{24}e^{it} + \frac{A}{2}\big(1 - A\bar{A}\big)te^{it} - \frac{iA^3}{24}e^{3it} + \text{complex conjugate}
\end{equation}
yields $dy_1/dt(0) \ne 0$.  Where's the catch?  I have some reason to believe this is the right expression for $y_1$ since a published research article uses this form, but I don't understand how it's possible for $dy_1/dt(0)$ to not equal 0.

Here is what I know. Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p$.  Fix a maximal torus $T\subset G$, and let $T$ act on Lie$(G)=\mathfrak{g}$ via the adjoint action.  Then $\mathfrak{g}$ decomposes as a direct sum of eigenspaces corresponding to this action.  The eigenvalues are the roots in the group of characters of the torus $T$.  Let the roots of $G$ with respect to $T$ be denoted by $\Phi$.  Choose a set of simple roots $\Pi\subset\Phi$. For each root $\alpha$, we can uniquely define a root subgroup $U_{\alpha}$ of $G$ as the image of a certain one-parameter subgroup $\mathbb{G}_a\to G$.  Furthermore, given a subset $J\subset\Pi$ of simple roots, we can define $P_J=\langle T,U_{\alpha}|\alpha\in J\rangle$.  Finally, there is exactly one Borel subgroup which contains the root subgroups corresponding to all positive roots (which depend on the choice of $\Pi$). Is all of this correct?  If so, it doesn't mean much to me without seeing an example or two worked through.  What are examples of these subgroups in the case that $G=GL_n$ and $T$ is the diagonal subgroup?  If this is too much to type out here, I would appreciate a link to any online notes that work through this example thoroughly.  It would be nice to see how $T$ determines the set of roots $\Phi$, what the root subgroups are for an arbitrary root, what the parabolic subgroups are for subsets of a choice of simple roots, and what the corresponding Borel subgroup is.","['examples-counterexamples', 'abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-groups', 'reference-request', 'root-systems']"

Show that if $G/N$ and $N$ are finitely presented, then $G$ is finitely presented. Worked on this problem for about 2 hours before we all threw in the towel. This is our first attempt, which seems the most valiant Let $N=\langle x_1,\dots x_k~|~R\rangle$ , and $G/N=\langle y_1N,\dots,y_lN~|~R'\rangle$ , where $|R|,|R'|<\infty$ . Now, $G=\langle x_1,\dots,x_k,y_1,\dots,y_l\rangle$ . Let $r'\in R'$ . $r'=(y_{i_1}N)^{m_1}(y_{i_2}N)^{m_2}\dots(y_{i_t}N)^{m_t}$ This is equal to $N$ in $G/N$ , so $y_{i_1}^{m_1}\dots y_{i_t}^{m_t}x_{j_1}^{n_1}\dots x_{j_s}^{n_s}=1$ (since the $x_i$ s generate $N$ ). This is not unique, but we can pick one such and call it $r''$ . Then, we let $R''=\cup r''$ , and claim that $G=\langle x_1,\dots x_k,y_1,\dots,y_l~|~R\cup R''\rangle$ Now suppose $H$ is a group, $h\colon\{x_1,\dots,x_k,y_1,\dots,y_l\}\rightarrow H$ a map, and $h(x_i),h(y_j)$ satisfy all relations in $R\cup R''$ . The universal property for $N$ says that there is a unique homomorphism $\phi_1\colon N\rightarrow H$ such that $\phi_1(x_i)=h(x_i)$ for all $i$ . Define $\bar{h}\colon\{y_1N,\dots,y_l N\}\rightarrow H$ by $\bar{h}(y_iN)=h(y_i)$ . Now, if $r'\in R'$ , we have $h(y_{i_1})^{m_1}\dots h(y_{i_t})^{m_t}h(x_{j_1})^{n_1}h(x_{j_s})^{n_s}=1$ in $H$ I'm not sure what I have here is useful. Suggestions welcome. I don't believe a proof as constructive as the one I have outlined could possibly work. Clearly, knowing the presentations for $N$ and $G/N$ is not enough to present $G$ ; $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3$ can build $\mathbb{Z}_6$ or $S_3$ , so this approach may be significantly off the mark.","['group-presentation', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

601194,Random Variable Vs. Probability Function Intuition?,"In a book on probability I'm reading they begin by defining random experiment, outcome, sample space & event, then using these notions they define & a probability space in terms of the sample space, a sigma field & a probability function. After about 80 pages of working with this theory, i.e. Bayes theorem, conditional probability etc... they introduce the notion of a random variable & the distribution function of a random variable. They give the impression that a random variable is a function of the outcomes,
& that it is defined independently of the notion of a probability function, which this stack answer seems to imply: Probability measures assign values (probabilities) to sets in the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$. On the other hand, random variables are functions $f\colon \Omega\to E$ that are measurable in this sense: If $B \in \mathcal{E}$, then $f^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{A}$. https://math.stackexchange.com/a/124504 yet other sources I've seen seem to conflate the two notions or even imply they
mean the same thing :( What is a random variable a) intuitively, b) mathematically & c) in a way that distinguishes it from a probability function, i.e. a nice intuitive example of a situation where you can't just use a probability function you need a random variable.

because $2f(t)=\{t\}(\{t\}-1)$ is bounded
