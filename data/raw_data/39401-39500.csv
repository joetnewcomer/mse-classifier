In particular, at the bottom of page 109 they say, ""by slitting each $P^\ast$ immediately below the positive $A_\Omega$ axis and then joining the fourth quadrant of the plane to the first quadrant of the one immediately below it."" Now I have two questions.  First, how do you ""join"" the fourth quadrant of one plane to the first quadrant of the one below it? Second, if you look at the picture it seems like they're actually joining the fourth quadrant of the one plane to the fourth quadrant of the plane beneath it.  Is this a typo or is the picture very misleading?  In this case it wouldn't be a vertical corkscrew but a slanted one.

386758,Proving rigorously the supremum of a set,"Suppose $\emptyset \neq A \subset \mathbb{R} $.  Let $A = [\,0,2).\,\,$   Prove that $\sup A = 2$ This is my attempt: $A$ is the half open interval $[\,0,2)$ and so all the $x_i \in A$ look like $0 \leq x_i < 2$ so clearly $2$ is an upper bound. To show it is the ${\it least}$ upper bound, suppose that $2 \neq \sup A$, that is there exists a number $M < 2$ for some real $M$ qualifying as $\sup A$.  Certainly this $M \in [0,2) $ so $ M > 0 \Rightarrow 2 -M > 0$. By the Archimedean Principle, for all real numbers $r > 0\,\, \exists\,\, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $0 < \frac{1}{n} < r $. By the Approximation Property of Suprema, there exists $a \in [0,2)$ such that $\sup A - \epsilon < a \leq \sup A$, where $\epsilon > 0$. Suppose $\sup A = M < 2$.  Then the above gives $M - \epsilon < a < 2\,\,\,\,\forall \epsilon > 0$.  Also, by Archimedean, we have $0 < \frac{1}{n} < 2-M$, so choose $\epsilon = 2-M$.  Then $M - (2-M) < a < 2 \,\Rightarrow 2(M-1) < a < 2$ We can assume $M - 1>0$ and so $2(M-1) > 2$  This results in a contradiction in the previous inequality.  Hence $M < 2$ cannot be the supremum.

386799,Which Cross Product for the Desired Orientation of a Sphere ? [Stewart P1091 16.7.23],"P1086: For a closed surface, the positive orientation is the one for which the normal vectors point outward from the surface, and inward-pointing normals give the negative orientation. P1087: If $S$ is a smooth orientable surface given in parametric form by a vector function $\mathbf{r}(u,v)$ , then it is automatically supplied with the orientation of the unit normal $\mathbf{n} = \cfrac{\partial_u\mathbf{r} \times \partial_v\mathbf{r}}{\vert \partial_u\mathbf{r} \times \partial_v \mathbf{r} \vert} $ ... P1093: The orientation of a surface S induces the positive orientation of the boundary curve C shown in the figure. This means that if one walks in the positive direction around the curve with one's head pointing in the direction of $\mathbf{n}$ , then the surface is always on one's left.

386820,Algebraic transformations to continuously extend functions,"Lately I was browsing through my analysis lecture notes (since right know I'm somewhat rusty in analysis) and the proof that $x \mapsto \frac{1}{x}$ is differentiable at every $x'\neq 0$ captured my attention. The easy proof is based on the following algebraic manipulation  $$\frac{\frac{1}{x+h}-\frac{1}{x}}{h}=\frac{1}{h}\frac{-h}{x^{2}+xh}=\frac{-1}{x^{2}+xh}.$$ Letting $h$ tend to zero, we get the limit that we sought. What aroused my interest was the idea that we can (continuously) extend a (continuous) function to a larger domain by simple algebraic manipulations (since in essence this is what we do, when calculating a derivative -- continuously extending a function): The second equality from above is key: By dividing by $h$ the domain changes from $\mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ (if we consider the functions $h\mapsto \frac{1}{h}\frac{-h}{x^{2}+xh}$ and $h\mapsto \frac{-1}{x^{2}+xh}$, for $x\in \mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$). Questions: 1. Is there some general theory of ""algebraic transformations"" that allow the extension  of functions (even if it extends the functions only for one single point, as for in the case of calculating derivatives) ? (I don't know what algebraic geometry deals with, but to the uneducated ear it sounds like this would be it) 2. What other kinds of purely algebraic tricks, like above, do you know, that allow you (in the context of finding derivatives) to continuously extend functions $h\mapsto \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ ? [From the examples of my notes (and 2 books I browsed through) the only tricks seems to be: $  \quad$- Manipulating the numerator long enough, until you can factor an $h$ out, so that  you can write $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=\frac{h}{h}\cdot s_x(h)$ for some function $s_x$, since the functions $h\mapsto \frac{h}{h}$ is preventing you from continuously  extending $h\mapsto \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ from $\mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ (and the function $h\mapsto \frac{h}{h}$ is trival to continuously extend to $\mathbb{R}$). $ \quad$- Writing $f$ as the product of $f=p_1 \cdot p_2$ and then adding and substracting again $p_1(x)\cdot p_2 (x+h)$ as in the proof that $(p_1 \cdot p_2)'=p_1' p_2 + p_1 p_2'$. (Estimating $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ etc. - anything that does not involve pure algebraic transformations to extend it - I'm not interested in. Also, very simple algebraic manipulations, like rearranging terms as in the proof that $(\frac{1}{f})'=\frac{-f}{f^2}$, don't count.]","['algebraic-geometry', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

386862,"Ring without $1$ where $\forall r\in R$, $\exists$ $n_r > 1$ such that $r^{n_r} = r$, and not all primes are maximal","On my algebra final exam, there was a problem that essentially asked the following: Let $R$ be a commutative ring such that for all $r\in R$, there exists $n_r\in\Bbb{Z}^{>1}$ with $r^{n_r} = r$. Prove that all prime ideals are maximal. The solution which I believe was desired goes like this: Let $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq R$ be prime. Take $a\in R\setminus\mathfrak{p}$, and consider $a + \mathfrak{p} = a^{n_a} + \mathfrak{p}\in R/\mathfrak{p}$. As a ring mod a prime ideal is an integral domain has no zero divisors, we can cancel. Assuming that $R$ has unity , we find $1 + \mathfrak{p} = a^{n_a - 1} + \mathfrak{p}$, and since $n_a > 1$, we can write
  $$
a\cdot a^{n_a - 2} + \mathfrak{p} = \left(a + \mathfrak{p}\right)\left(a^{n_a - 2} + \mathfrak{p}\right) = 1 + \mathfrak{p},
$$
  so we have found an inverse for any nonzero element in $R/\mathfrak{p}$. Since $R/\mathfrak{p}$ is commutative, $R/\mathfrak{p}$ is a field, and hence $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal. I had a problem with the cancellation step. It seems to require $R$ that have unity, whereas the problem statement does not require $R$ to have unity. I think this was a misstatement on my professor's part, but I cannot seem to find a counterexample. It isn't too much trouble to find an $R$ (without unity) with the property that for all $ r\in R$, there exists $ n_r\in\Bbb{Z}^{> 1}$ such that $r^{n_r} = r$: take for example, the subring of $\left(\Bbb{Z}/p\Bbb{Z}\right)^{\Bbb{N}}$ (countably infinite product of $\Bbb{Z}/p\Bbb{Z}$'s) where all but finitely many entries in a ""vector"" are nonzero.
It's easy to see that this ring does not have unity; however, it still satisfies the property that every prime ideal is maximal. I tried to come up with a genuine counterexample, but I couldn't find one. My idea was to modify the example above by considering an infinite product of some integral domain $\mathcal{O}$ ( not a field) where $a^{n_a} = a$ for some $n_a > 1$ for each $a\in\mathcal{O}$, but I couldn't find such an $\mathcal{O}$.

With my little experience I was unable to overcome this (all I was able to conclude is that these groups are disjoint short of the identity), and also did not find any solution with a search on google (except for stronger theorems which I am not interested in because of my novice level). I remember that a similar result is widely known as one of Sylow Theorems. This result was proven by the use of group actions. But can my problem be proved without using the concept of group actions? Can this be proven WITH the use of that concept? EDIT: With help from comments I came up with this: The action Derek proposed is well-defined largely because in a group if $ab = e$ (the identity), then certainly $ba = e$. By Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem we can see that all orbits are either of size 1 or $p$ (here I had most problems, and found out cyclic group of order $p$ acts on the set of solutions in the same way).
The orbits of size 1 contain precisely the elements $(x,x,x....,x)$ for some element x in G. In addition, orders of all orbits add up to $|G|^{(p-1)}$ because the orbits are equivalence classes of an equivalence relation.
But certainly $(e,e,e....,e)$ is in an orbit of size 1, and that means there has to be more orbits of exactly one element, actually $p-1 + np$ more for some integer $n$. These elements form the disjoint groups I am looking for. if $p-1$ divides $(p-1 + np)$, it's easy to check the result is 1 mod p.

386967,Necessary and sufficient conditions for differentiability.,"Apologizes if I'm missing something in my question or if my question seems trivial; this is my first question on this site. As motivation for my question, consider the following standard first year calculus question. Consider this piecewise function:
  $
   f(x) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       ax^2+b & \text{ if } x \le-2\\
       12x-5 & \text{ if } x >-2
     \end{array}
   \right.
$ For what values of $a$ and $b$ will $f(x)$ be differentiable? To solve this question, I would like to propose the following theorem: $\mathbf{Theorem:}$ A function $f(x)$ is differentiable iff $f'(x)$ is continuous. If this theorem is true, then I can solve for $a$ first by noting that:
$
   f'(x) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       2ax & \text{ if } x \le-2\\
       12 & \text{ if } x >-2
     \end{array}
   \right.
$ Thus, since by my theorem $f'(x)$ must be continuous, we have: $$\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \rightarrow -2^-}f'(x) &= \lim_{x \rightarrow -2^+}f'(x)\\
\lim_{x \rightarrow -2^-}2ax &= \lim_{x \rightarrow -2^+}12\\
2a(-2) &= 12\\
-4a &= 12 \\
a &= -3 \\
\end{align*}$$ Hence, since differentiability implies continuity, we can solve for $b$ as follows: $$\begin{align*}

What is the meaning for that? Is this the ""real"" probability? First, we need to define accurately what means at random , I'll assume a base $10$ . Then all numbers in $[0,1]$ begins with $0$ (for $1$ we discard this notation and we will use $0.9999\ldots$ ). Then I'll give a classical approach defining random meaning, if we pick a real number $x$ in $[0,1]$ at random we mean that the probability to get a digit in certain position is $1/10$ (extending for $[0,1]$ the Laplace classical definition for probability), roughly speaking each digit has the same ""probability"" to be in $x$ . Strictly speaking we are building a notion of probability in $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}^\omega$ since numbers with a $0$ periodic has two representations. We want to pass the intuitive notion of probability to this set, but if there is one, this must be unique. The Lebesgue measure $m$ rescues some of these probabilistic notions for example $m(\emptyset)=0$ , $m(\{x\})=0$ , and $m(\text{numbers starting with the given digit $k$})=\frac{1}{10}$ , but intuitively a probability notion must be defined in all subsets ( Edit: sos440 in comments says that is natural this phenomenon (not defined in all subsets) since we can't describe some sets without using additional axioms like "" Zorn Lemma "") apart of having some properties like (finite or $\sigma$ )-additivity. Lebesgue measure also satisfies $m(\mathbb{Q\cap [0,1]})=0$ . Does our intuitive notion of probability tell us that the probability to get a rational number is $0$ ? Other functions(""measures"") in $[0,1]$ are defined in whole $\mathcal{P}([0,1])$ but doesn't coincides with $m$ and we loss other notions for our intuitive probability meaning.

387180,Do we get predicative ordinals above $\Gamma_0$ if we use hyperexponentiation?,"I am trying to understand the Veblen hierarchy but I still find it confusing. 
The Feferman–Schütte ordinal, $\Gamma_0$, can be described as the set of all ordinals that can be written as finite expressions, starting from zero, using only the Veblen hierarchy and addition. The Veblen hierarchy starts with the function $\omega^\alpha$ and uses recursion to generate larger and larger functions. 
But I am not sure why we start with $f(\alpha)=\omega^\alpha$, or why we restrict the definition of $\Gamma_0$ to Veblen hierarchy and addition. Would we  obtain recursive ordinals larger than $\Gamma_0$ if we start the hierarchy with some faster growing function? For instance we can use hyperoperators to define  $f(\alpha)=(\alpha\uparrow ^\alpha \alpha)^{(\alpha)}$ (where the upperscript $(\alpha)$ means $\alpha$-times composition) which is immensely huge. We could also include this new hierarchy plus addition and any hyperoperator to define the limit $\Gamma_0$.

In fact if I am correct the total is 1465. One method would be enumerating all such matrices, counting the number of distinct matrices resulting from each of the eight symmetries. But this takes too long, even for a computer, for n > 6 or so. Burnside's lemma seems promising, but this requires counting fixed points and I do not know how to do this rapidly.

Does there always exist a natural number $a$ such that for all $i$ there exists some natural number $1\leq c\leq a$ such that: $$\displaystyle \frac{ab-1}{(c-1)b+1}\geq x_i \geq \frac{ab-1}{cb-1}\tag{1}$$ One may think of this as having a UNION of $a$ intervals $\left[\frac{ab-1}{cb-1},\frac{ab-1}{(c-1)b+1}\right]$  on the real line and proving that, for some $a$, these can trap any finite discrete set of rational numbers having cardinality $b-2$. For example, Let's assume $b=10$, $x=\{\frac{12}{5},\frac{17}{5},\frac{59}{10},\frac{187}{20},15,21,\frac{67}{2},39 \}$, then $(1)$ is true for $a=4$ and $a=5$ and therefore the intervals for $a=4,5$ contain or ""trap"" all the members of set $x$. In the diagram, the red/green regions are intervals $\left[\frac{ab-1}{cb-1},\frac{ab-1}{(c-1)b+1}\right]$ for all $c<a$. What mathematical tools can one employ to tackle this? WHAT I DID: I solved the inequality $(1)$ for $a$ and got $$\large x_i\left(1-\frac{2}{b}\right)+\frac{x_i+1}{b}+cx_i\geq a\geq \frac{x_i+1}{b}+cx_i\tag{2}$$ Note that $\frac{x_i+1}{b}+cx_i$ is common on both sides of the inequality. Now I'll just have to plug in the values of $x_i$ to get $b-2$ inequalities and check for a common value of $a$ for any $c$. For example, Let $x_i \in \{  \frac{101}{4},\frac{3001}{7} \}$ and $b=4$ then we have inequalities $\frac{307}{16}+\left(\frac{101}{4}\right)c_1\geq a\geq \frac{105}{16}+\left(\frac{101}{4}\right)c_1$ $\frac{911}{32}+\left(\frac{301}{8}\right)c_2\geq a\geq \frac{309}{32}+\left(\frac{301}{8}\right)c_2$ Put $c=2$ in the first inequality and $c=1$ in the second inequality to get a common $a=58$. But how should one go about to prove that there will always be some value of $a$ which satisfies the above set of inequalities? I calculated numerically for some random $b$ and $x_i$ and always managed to get some $a$, i.e., there existed some $a$ which trapped random $x_i$ given some random $b$.

Consider the function $f:A \to B$. Then $f$ is onto iff it's one-to-one. I think I can handle proving this in one direction. That is, I will show that if $f$ is not onto, then it must not be one-to-one. Suppose $f$ is not onto. Then $∃b^*∈B$ such that $∀a∈A$, $f(a)≠b^*$. Thus, $f$ must map all $n$ elements in $A$ to at most $n-1$ elements in $B$. By the Pigeonhole Principle, it follows that $∃a_1,a_2∈A$ and $∃b'∈B$ such that $f(a_1)=b'=f(a_2)$ yet $a_1≠a_2$. So $f$ is not one-to-one, as desired. Hopefully that was rigorous. As for the other direction ($f$ is not one-to-one $\implies$ $f$ is not onto), I could use some help. Any suggestions?

Now $H_1$ and $H_2$ are finite $p$-groups, where $p \nmid \vert A_i \vert, i=1,2$. Prove that $RG_1 \cong RG_2$ iff $\mathbb Z A_{1} \cong \mathbb Z A_2$ and $\mathbb{Z} H_1 \cong \mathbb{Z} H_2$. Having no idea how to start, I first tried solving a different exercise, also related to direct products: If $G_1=H_1 \times A_1$ is a finite group, where $(\vert H_1 \vert,\vert A_1 \vert)=1$, and $G_2$ is any other group, then: $\mathbb Z G_1 \cong \mathbb Z G_2$ iff $G_2=H_2 \times A_2$, $\mathbb{Z}A_1 \cong \mathbb Z A_2$ and $\mathbb Z H_1 \cong \mathbb Z H_2$. Proof: One direction is clear, since $\mathbb Z (G \times H) \cong \mathbb Z G \otimes \mathbb Z H$. For the other direction, since $H_1 \trianglelefteq G_1$, by the normal subgroup correspondence, there exists a unique normal subgroup $H_2 \trianglelefteq G_2$  such that $\mathbb Z (G_2 / H_2) \cong \mathbb Z (G_1/H_1) \cong \mathbb Z A_1$. Doing the same for $A_1 \trianglelefteq G_1$ gives $\mathbb{Z}(G_2/A_2) \cong \mathbb Z H_1$. The correspondence respects intersections, so $A_2 \cap H_2= \emptyset$. Since $\vert A_2 \times H_2 \vert= \vert A_2 \vert \cdot \vert H_2 \vert=\vert A_1 \vert \cdot \vert H_1 \vert =\vert G_1 \vert = \vert G_2 \vert$ ($\mathbb Z G_1$ and $\mathbb Z G_2$ have the same rank over $\mathbb Z$), I think we can conclude that $G_2=A_2 \times H_2$. $\square$ EDIT: Does anyone know why the orders are supposed to be coprime? This doesn't really seem to help for the first exercise though. Since $R=k_1 \times k_2 \times \ldots \times k_n$, where the $k_i$ are fields of characteristic $p$, it is probably helpful to first consider $R=k$.

387380,Rank of a $n! \times n$ matrix,"This question is about showing that $n!$ points resulting from applying a function (defined below) to the permutations of $n$ numbers lie on a $n-1$ dimensional hyperplane. Let $X=\langle x_1,\cdots,x_n \rangle$ and $Y=\langle y_1,\cdots,y_n \rangle$ be vectors of positive reals and let $P=\langle p_1,\cdots,p_n \rangle$ be a permutation of the numbers $\{1,\cdots,n\}$. Let, $$
y_i=\log\left(1+\frac{x_i}{1+\sum\limits_{p_j<\,p_i}x_j}\right)
$$
be a mapping from $X,P$ to $Y$.
So, for any given vector $X$, we have $n!$ (one for each permutation) output vectors $Y$. 
Let $Y_P$ denote a vector resulting from permutation $P$.
Now, for a given $X$, create a matrix $M$ such that each row of it is $Y_P-Y_{P_1}$ for a fixed $P_1$ and for all $P$. $$
M=\begin{bmatrix} Y_{P_1}-Y_{P_1} \\ Y_{P_2}-Y_{P_1} \\ \vdots \\ Y_{P_{n!}}-Y_{P_1} \end{bmatrix}
$$ So, $M$ is a $n! \times n$ matrix. I have two questions: I guess the rank of $M$ is at most $n-1$, that is all of $Y$'s lie on a hyperplane of dimension $n-1$ (I verified it for $n=3$ and $n=4$). Is that true or not? Why? For what sort of mappings from $X,P$ to $Y$, is the answer to the previous question positive? Edit 3: I realized that for all of the permutations, $\sum_i y_i = \log(1+\sum_i x_i)$ and as Chris Culter commented below, this might be the solution to the problem.
The proof of inequality is long but an example clears its correctness: consider $n=3$ and $P=\langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle$, $$
\begin{align}
y_1+y_2+y_3&=
\log(1+\frac{x_1}{1+x_2+x_3})+
\log(1+\frac{x_2}{1+x_3})+
\log(1+\frac{x_3}{1})\\
&=
\log(\frac{1+x_1+x_2+x_3}{1+x_2+x_3})+
\log(\frac{1+x_2+x_3}{1+x_3})+
\log(\frac{1+x_3}{1})\\
&=
\log(1+x_1+x_2+x_3).
\end{align}
$$ Since any other permutation only renames $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$, the output remains the same. Edit 2: The problem has a specific structure which may help solving it: The $n!$ points consist of $n$ ensembles of $(n-1)!$ points. Ensemble $i$ consists of all of the points $Y_P$ such that $i^{th}$ element of $P$ is 1. Therefore, all of the points in ensemble $i$ has the same $y_i$. For example, for $n=3$, there are 3 ensembles of 2 points (6 points in total).
All of the points lie on a 2D plane.
The following figure shows an example in 3D: Points in the same ensemble have a same colour. The labels beside the points denote the permutation that generates the point. So, points 123 and 132 are in ensemble 1, points 213 and 312 are in ensemble 2 (1 is the second element of their permutation), and points 231 and 321 are in ensemble 3 (1 is the third element of their permutation). For $n=4$, there are 4 ensembles of 6 points (24 points in total). Since all of the points in 4D lie on a 3D plane, we can project the points into the 3D space. Here is an example: Higher dimensions are recursively constructed as described above.
So, for $n=5$, there are 5 ensembles of the form shown above (in 4D).
This recursive nature can be useful for solving the problem. Edit 3: I used Mathematica to verify my conjecture for $n=3$ to $8$ and it's correct. See my other question on Mathematica.SE . For $n>8$, because of the exponential running time of the algorithm, it's hard to verify the conjecture. The above conjecture also holds for the following mapping functions: $$
y_i={x_i}-{\sum\limits_{p_j<\,p_i}x_j}
$$ $$
y_i={x_i}^3-{\sum\limits_{p_j<\,p_i}{x_j}^2}
$$ But it does not hold for the following functions: $$
y_i=\log\left(\frac{x_i}{1+\sum\limits_{p_j<\,p_i}x_j}\right)
$$ $$
y_i={x_i}^3-\left(\sum\limits_{p_j<\,p_i}x_j\right)^2

Edit: We're working on ground field $\Bbb{C}$ The term ruled stands here for birationally ruled Let $S$ be an algebraic smooth surface and $C$ a smooth projective curve. If there is a morphism $p:S\rightarrow C$ with each fiber birational to $\Bbb{P}^1$ let's say that $S$ is a rational fibration . By the Noether-Enriques theorem each rational fibration is a ruled surface. Claim: If $S\neq\Bbb{P}^2$ then $S$ is a rational fibration if and only if $S$ is ruled. Assume this is true. Then given a ruled surface $S\neq\Bbb{P}^2$ we consider $S$ as a rational fibration and there can be at most a finite number of fibers which are birational but not isomorphic to $\Bbb{P}^1$. So they are singular irreducible curves (right?). Hence by a finite sequence of blow-ups we get a geometrically ruled surface, i.e. a rational fibration with each fiber isomorphic to the line. Is this argument correct? Do you think that claim is true? Edit: Since Asal's answer suggests the claim is false. Let me re-question: suppose $S\neq\Bbb{P}^2$ is birationally ruled.

387415,Formula for ' constant-power' across 3 sound sources (3-way DJ Crossfader),"First time poster here - thank you profusely in advance for any help you can provide! Intro/Context I need help to expand upon an existing mathematical approach to providing 'constant power' in context of a DJ crossfader (previous discussion here - Simple Formula for Curve of DJ Crossfader volume : Dipped ). In summary on this prior topic, two signals (e.g. two songs) are able to be faded between one another using a crossfader, which for example can go from x-axis position '0' (100% song A, 0% song B) to x-axis position '1' (0% song A, 100% song B). A common equation to evaluate the combined power of each channel as the crossfader moves along the x-axis is $f(x) = \cos(\frac{\pi}{2}x)$. This allows us to take any point on the x-axis, and the square of the two combined y-axis values, for each of the sound sources, will always = 1. This is the condition we must to meet to ensure constant power, since 'power' is sound pressure squared. For this equation, the y-axis is 'power', with y(1) being 100% power, and the x-axis is distance between the signal and the crossfader position (0 being 100%, 1 being 0% as the crossfader is positioned on the opposite side).  If you're a little confused, head over to the linked discussion to check out the graphs. My question! I have an equilateral triangle drawn on a flat plane (lets say the x,z plane). The coordinates of it's vertices are as follows : (x,z)
Point A - (0,0)
Point B - (0.5,0.86602540378)
Point C - (1,0) distance of all 3 sides = 1 In my application, these coordinates are the origins of 3 signals (sound sources) I have defined within a triangular cross-fader. Instead of fading between two sound sources using a 1-dimensional left to right fader as done in traditional mixers, I'd like to (using a touch screen interface), fade between 3 sound sources on a 2-dimensional plane whilst maintaining constant power (sum of all squared y-axis values  = 1). I need to find an equation or a mathematical approach which will allow me to pick any point inside or on the border of my equilateral triangle (x,z plane), and have the sum of the squares of the 3 y-axis points equal 1 (much like $f(x) = \cos(\frac{\pi}{2}x)$ on the 2-dimensional / 2 sound source). The distance from one of the vertices will define the percentage of total power that particular source sound is granted. If it's 'on' the vertex, that means that distance is 0, therefore 100% of the sound comes form that source. In this instance, the distance from the other two vertices equals 1, therefore no power is granted to those signals. My background in mathematics is not profoundly strong, and I'm at a loss as to how to build a x,y,z equation which fulfils these basic requirements. In my minds-eye, I can see 3 similar cos/sin function curved 360 degrees around in the z-plane, with the center point each being my 3 coordinates, with the sum of the squared y-axis values always being 1. But this is in my head :) Another approach would be for me just to get a ratio of the 3 'distances' between point P and the sound sources (vertices), and somehow grant each their slice of the power pie as long as the sum of their squared y-axis values = 1... I'd also like it to be as 'soft' as possible so the curvature of the graph which the equation defines doesn't have any points where the tangent is extreme.. this would mean one of my sound sources volume would ramp up / cut off too quickly. Any ideas? Many Many thanks for your time. Hakon.","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions']"

What I mean is, if you were to look at the shape of the posts in the thread (ignoring their content and time of posting), how many unique arrangements can there be?  This means that for 3 posters, A, B, and C, the following cases are equivalent: A        A
└─B      └─C
C        B So for N = 3, the total number of arrangements is 5: A        A        A        A        A
B        B        └─B      ├─B      └─B
C        └─C      C        └─C        └─C If it weren't for the topologically unique restriction, the answer would be simply f(N-1) * N , or N! .  For N < 3 , this actually holds; f(0) = f(1) = 1 , and f(2) = 2 .  The first poster has no choice of where to post, and the second can reply to either the initial blog or to the first poster.  But from then on, it gets more complicated. f(3) would be 3! or 6 if it weren't for that duplicate case.  For higher N's, there are more and more equivalent cases.  Can anyone come up with a simple formula that will cover this for any N?","['general-topology', 'recreational-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
387629,Does $p(a) = p(b) \Rightarrow a=b \ $?,"Let $S = (P_1,P_2, \ldots,P_n)$ be a set of polynomials with complex coefficients. I call S critical if set of solutions of $\{P_n(a) = P_n(b)\forall n \}$ in $\Bbb C^2$ is $\{ (a=b) \cup (\text{some finite points in }\Bbb C^2)\}$ 
I call  a set minimal critical set  if it is a critical set but no proper subset of it is critical. Examples of minimal critical sets are (a*z +b) ($z^2, z^3$) or ($z^2 +z, z^4$) Question is does there exist minimal critical sets of cardinality n for every n ?
for example what are the examples for n=3,4  with proof? It is easy to find infinite subsets T of polynomials which do not have any minimal critical subset, for example $\{P(z^2)\ \forall P\}$, but then is there a condition on such sets?",['algebraic-geometry']

387654,Joint PDF over a uniform interval,"A particle is emitted at time zero and undergoes a decay at some random time $S$. One of the decay products is then observed at time $T \geq S$. Suppose that $T$ has probability density function: $$ f_T(t) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       \lambda^2te^{-\lambda t} & : t > 0\\
       0 & : t \leq 0
     \end{array}
   \right.$$
  For each $t > 0$ the conditional distribution of $S$ given that $T = t$ is uniform over the interval $(0, t)$. Find the joint probability density function of $S$ and $T$. Use this to ﬁnd the joint probability density function of $S$ and $W = T - S$. Determine if $S$ and $W$ are independent. I think the best option is to try and condition $f_T(t)$ on $S$ to solve for $f_{S,T}(s,t)$, but I can't figure how to go about doing that. Any help would be appreciated.","['statistics', 'probability']"

387727,Why is Transitivity necessary in the definition in the definition of an order on a set?,"In Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis (ed. 3), he provides the following definition (pp. 3) Definition: Let $S$ be a set. An order on $S$ is a relation, denoted by $<$ , with the following two properties: (1) If $x \in S$ and $y\in S$ then one and only one of the statements: $x<y$ , $x=y$ , or $y<x$ is true. (2) If $x,y,z \in S$ , if $x<y$ and $y<z$ , then $x<z$ The question I asked myself is if property 2 must hold by definition. There answer I had come up with is yes. Suppose that the above definition is provided with only the first condition. Now take a set, $S=(1,3,5)$ . Next define the following order on $S$ : $1<3$ , $3<5$ , $5<1$ . The above order satisfies the first property of the defintion, but not the second. Hence Transitivity as a definition is required. Is my reasoning correct, and is there anything I missed?","['relations', 'elementary-set-theory']"
387740,Relation between Normed space and inner product,"Below is what i have proved: If $V$ is a normed vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ satisfies parallelogram equality, then there exists an inner product $\langle \bullet,\bullet\rangle$ such that $\langle \bullet,\bullet \rangle = \lVert \bullet \rVert^2$ If $V$ is an inner product space over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\lVert \bullet \rVert \triangleq \sqrt{\langle \bullet \rangle}$, then $\lVert \bullet \rVert$ is a norm and $\langle x,y\rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\lVert x+y\rVert^2 - \lVert x-y\rVert^2)$. I thought defining a norm as square root of inner product $\langle x,x\rangle$ is just one possinle way to define norm on an inner product space. However, the below is the article in wikipedia about impossibility of defining $p-norm$ on an inner product space: ""p ≠ 2 is a normed space but not an inner product space, because this norm does not satisfy the parallelogram equality required of a norm to have an inner product associated with it"" I don't think what i proved above give this conclusion in wikipeia.. What should i prove to conclude this? Plus, it's on wikipedia that $2$-notm is completely natural to define as so, but it's not that natural to take square root to inner product to define norm on an inner product space to me. Why do we specifically use 2-norm? Moreover, what's the point of relating two concepts inner product and norm, literally?","['normed-spaces', 'linear-algebra', 'inner-products']"
