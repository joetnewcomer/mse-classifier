3278542,Minimum number of vertices needed to construct a graph.,"I am given following problem as homework. Let $G$ be a vertex obtained by attaching a pendant vertex $x$ to $K_n$ and $n\geq 3$ . I need to show that I need at least $2r-2$ vertices to add to $G$ to obtain a graph $H$ so that the resulting graph has two vertices with eccentricity $r+1$ and rest with eccentricity $r$ . also, $G$ induced in H$.  I assumed the following cases. It is clear that $diam(G) = 2$ . 
Let $x$ be a pendant vertex attached to $K_n$ and $vx\in E(G)$ for some $v\in V(K_n)$ .
Let $H$ be an $r$ -ASC embedding graph in which graph $G$ is induced.
We have following two cases here depending upon eccentricity of vertex $x$ in $H$ . Case (a) $x$ is a diametral vertex of $H$ , i.e. $e_H(x) = r+1$ . Proved by me. Case (b) $x$ is not a diametral vertex in $H$ , i.e. $e_H(x) = r$ . In this case, we have following subcases depending whether $K_n$ contains a diametral vertex or not. Subcase (i) $K_n$ contains a diametral vertex, say $y$ .
Then there exists vertex $z$ in $H$ such that $d_H(y,z) = r+1$ .
Let $P: y=y_0,y_1,\ldots,y_{r+1} = z$ be a diametral path. Then $P_1$ contains
at least $r-1$ vertices ( $r+2-3 = r-1$ , atmost three from $G$ ) Subcase (ii) $K_n$ does not contain a diametral vertex. How to move forward in the first subcase? Any hint or help will be highly appreciated. Thanks a lot for the help.","['graph-theory', 'proof-explanation', 'proof-writing', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

When it comes to the part from the title, I tried to construct such a function I took $\log(|t|)$ but then I realized it wont work if you have only vertical asymptotes because this function would span whole $\mathbb{R}$ twice, missing some points that need to be assign to something.It might be hard to construct such a function so now I suspect there might be some clever way to prove it indirectly.","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"

Well these six numbers correspond to another four numbers $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Z}$ in such a way that if you take any two numbers among $a,b,c,d$ their difference produces a perfect square. There is six pairs so it corresponds to finding six perfect squares that satisfy the system of equations above. In the end we have a set of numbers that all differ between each other by a perfect square.

3278677,Existence of infinite set of positive integers s.t sum of reciprocals is rational and set of primes dividing an element is infinite,"Does there exist a sequence $(a_i)_{i \geq 0}$ of distinct positive integers such that $\sum_{i\geq 0}\frac{1}{a_i} \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $$\{ p \in \mathbb{P} \text{ }|\text{ } \exists\text{ } i\geq 0  \text{  s.t.}\text{ } p | a_i\}$$ is infinite? Motivation: All geometric series (corresponding to sets $\{ 1,n,n^2,n^3,... \}$ ) are rational and the terms obviously contain finitely many primes. The same is true for say, sums of reciprocals of all numbers whose prime factiorisation contains only the primes $p_1, p_2, ...,p_k$ : the sum is then $\prod_{i=1}^k\left(\frac{p_i}{p_i-1}\right)$ On the other side, series corresponding to sets $\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ...\}, \{1^3,2^3,3^3,...\},\{1!,2!,3!,...\}$ converge to $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$ , Apery's constant and $e$ respectively, which are all known to be irrationals. I am aware of the fact that if this statement is true then it has not been proven yet (since it implies that the values of the zeta function at positive integers are irrational, which to my knowledge has not been shown yet).

3278686,"Domain, Codomain, Range, Image and Preimage","Can someone please explain to me in layman what each means? Perhaps with some examples with functions (inputs to outputs/numeric values in them)? Especially range, image, and preimage.

Range sounds like codomain but with some restriction? Image I have little understanding of but I think it is basically a relation between domain to codomain given that we take a subset of our function (Eg; it is the input to output process of our function given we put a restriction on the domain as $x$ can only go from $0$ to $1$ ). Preimage is just walking backward on the ""image"" process? (Inverse image?) Going from our ""subsetted"" output back to our ""subsetted"" input?

The most applicable criterium I have found so far is Worpitzky's theorem which guarantees convergence whenever $\max a_n \leq  1/4.$ However, this result is far more general since it is concerned with complex valued $a_n$ . The specific case we are interested in is finding the domain of $x$ that gives convergence in the above continued fraction with $$a_n = a_n(x) = \frac{2}{(2 + (n+1) x)(2 + (n+2) x)}.$$ So, $a_n =O(n^{-2})$ and $a_{n+1}/a_n \uparrow 1$ .","['continued-fractions', 'convergence-divergence', 'combinatorics']"

3278895,Notation of inverse functions vs powers of minus one in probit function definition,"The question arose after reading this Wikipedia article . $\Phi^{-1}(p)$ stands for probit, because it's inverse function of cumulative distribution function, which is traditionally $\Phi^{}(z)$ If I understood it right, it's not the power of minus one, but an inverse function. Thus, if you have a value of $z$ , you can obtain the probability with $\Phi(z)$ , but if you have the probability first, then you can obtain the $z$ with $\Phi^{-1}(p)$ . It has nothing with power function, just a weird notation (for me). Then I read this: $\operatorname{probit}(p)=\sqrt2\operatorname{erf}^{-1}(2p-1)$ And now I don't know, if this $\operatorname{erf}^{-1}(2p-1)$ notation is $1/\operatorname{erf}(2p-1)$ , or there is an inverse $\operatorname{erf}$ function. I haven't seen inverse $\operatorname{erf}$ function before, and there's no much sense in defining $\operatorname{probit}$ in terms of it. But my computations show that $1/\operatorname{erf}(2p-1)$ do not produce right values. Questions are: Is there's a general way to distinguish ""inverse function"" from ""power of minus one"" notation?

3278974,"if $h$ is twice differentiable, what is the largest set on which $|h|$ is twice differentiable?","Let $h:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ be twice differentiable.

Moreover, if $a\in\{h'=0\}$ , then $$\left|\frac{|h|(a+t)-|h|(a)}t\right|\le\left|\frac{h(a+t)-h(a)}t\right|\xrightarrow{t\to0}0\tag2$$ by the reverse triangle inequaly and hence $|h|$ is differentiable at $a$ with $$|h|'(a)=0=h'(a)\operatorname{sgn}h(a)\tag3.$$ So, $|h|$ is differentiable at least on $D_1:=\{h\ne0\}\cup\{h'=0\}$ with derivative $h'\operatorname{sgn}h$ . (Can we enlarge $D_1$ ?) Turning to the second derivative: Using that $\operatorname{sgn}h$ is differentiable at $a$ with $$(\operatorname{sgn}h)'(a)=0\tag4$$ for all $a\in\{h\ne0\}\cup\{h=0\}^\circ$ , we obtain (by the chain rule, again) that $|h|$ is twice differentiable at $a$ with $$|h|''(a)=h''(a)\operatorname{sgn}h(a)\tag5$$ for all $a\in D_2:=\{h\ne0\}\cup\{h=0\}^\circ$ (noting that $\{h=0\}^\circ\subseteq\{h'=0\}$ ). So, $|h|'$ is differentiable at least on $D_2$ . Can we enlarge $D_2$ ? On the other hand, we can show that $|h|'$ is differentiable at $a$ with $$|h|''(a)=|h''(a)|$$ for all $$a\in D_3:=\{h=0\}\cap\{h'=0\}\cap(\{h''\ne0\}\cup\{h''=0\}\cap D_1^\circ).$$ However, I'm struggling to see how $D_2$ and $D_3$ are related and hence whether the latter yields an enlargement of $D_2$ . EDIT : And as a third option, it's possible to show that $|h|$ is twice differentiable on $D_4:=\mathbb R\setminus\overline{N'}$ , where $N':=\left\{a\in\mathbb R:a\text{ is an isolated point of }\left\{h=0\right\}\right\}$ ; see revision 3 of this answer (and the comments below): https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3210082/47771 .

3279331,Help proving a property of probability distributions,"Let $p = (p_1, p_2, ... p_k)$ where $p_i = \mathbb{P}(i)$ . Here, $p$ is any discrete probability distribution, but I will refer to it as the probability distribution for some $k$ sided unfair dice. Now let $\pi_i(p) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^k (p_j)^i$ . I conjecture that $\forall i \ge 2, \pi_i(p) \ge (\pi_2(p))^{i-1}$ , but I'm not sure how to go about proving it. The idea behind this conjecture is that $\pi_i(p)$ is the probability that exactly $i$ rolls of the dice have the same outcome, and that the probability of this occurring is greater than or equal to the probability of the 1st roll matching the 2nd, the 2nd roll matching the 3rd, and so on, until the $i-1$ th roll matching the $i$ th roll (which means matching 2 rolls $i-1$ times). This property would also allow me to rigorously prove a lower bound for another probability which I already suspect to be true, which is another reason why I believe this property should be true. ==================================================================== Update: I've found a way to prove a slightly weaker version of the conjecture: Let $p = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_k)$ be some discrete probability distribution, let $q = (\frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{k}, ..., \frac{1}{k})$ be a uniform probability distribution, and let $\pi_i$ be defined as above. Then $\forall i \ge 2, \pi_i(p) \ge (\pi_2(q))^{i-1} = \big(\frac{1}{k}\big)^{i-1}$ Proof: According to the top answer on Relations between p norms , based on Hölder's inequality, $\forall 0 < a < b$ , $\Vert p \Vert_a \le k^{1/a-1/b} \Vert p \Vert_b$ Letting $a = 1$ and $b = i \ge 2$ , we have that \begin{align}
     & \Vert p \Vert_1 = 1 \le k^{1-1/i} \Vert p \Vert_i \\
\iff\quad & k^{1/i-1} \le (\pi_i(p))^{1/i} \\
\iff\quad & k^{1-i} \le \pi_i(p) \\
\iff\quad & \Big(\frac{1}{k}\Big)^{i-1} \le \pi_i(p)
\end{align} Additionally, we have that $\pi_2(q) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^k (q_j)^2 = \sum\limits_{j=1}^k \big(\frac{1}{k})^2 = k \cdot \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{1}{k}$ So substituting, we have $\forall i \ge 2, \pi_i(p) \ge (\pi_2(q))^{i-1}$ $$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$ Additionally, $(\pi_2(q))^{i-1} = \pi_i(q)$ (this is relatively easy to prove), so this also proves that the probability of getting $i$ identical rolls on an unfair dice is greater than or equal to the probability of getting $i$ identical rolls on a fair dice, which is an interesting result in its own right (at least it is to me).","['probability-distributions', 'probability']"

3279377,How many zeros in the decimal representation of $5^n$?,"I'm curious about some properties of the powers of 5 $$5^2=25,\quad5^3=125,\quad 5^4=625,\quad 5^5=3125,\quad ...$$ Is it true that at least $50$ % of the digits in the decimal representation of $5^n$ are non-zero? This seems pretty modest since assuming each digit will be equally likely, only about $10$ % of the digits will be zero on average. The first zero occurs at $5^8=390625$ and the power with the largest percentage of zeros seems to be $$5^{45}=28421709430404007434844970703125$$ in which $\approx 22$ % of the digits are zero. I checked up to $5^{1000}$ . The difficulty is the statement seems so obvious from a probabilistic perspective, yet I can't pin down any definite theorems! Obviously the first and the last 3 digits will always be non-zero so we have at least 4 non-zero digits. But I'm hoping to prove some properties about $5^n$ in general which require the non-zero digits to be at least linear in $n$ . So $50$ % would be more than enough. Really any probability $\epsilon>0$ will do -- bigger the better though. Maybe analyze $\langle 5 \rangle^\times$ in $\mathbb{Z}/10^k\mathbb{Z}$ ?

3279454,Hamilton's equations arising from a variational principle.,"In page 16 of McDuff & Salamon's Introduction to Symplectic Topology they prove that the critical points $z = (x,y)\colon [a,b] \to \Bbb R^{2n}$ of the action integral $$\Phi_H(z) = \int_a^b \langle y, \dot{x}\rangle - H(t,x,y)\,{\rm d}t$$ satisfy Hamilton's equations $\dot{x} = \partial_yH$ and $\dot{y} = -\partial_xH$ . Namely, they compute the first variation of $\Phi_H(z)$ as $$\widehat{\Phi_H}(z) = \int_a^b \langle \eta,\dot{x}-\partial_yH\rangle - \langle \xi, \dot{y}+\partial_xH\rangle\,{\rm d}t,$$ where $(\xi,\eta)$ is the variational vector field of a variation of $z$ with fixed endpoints. I have no problems whatsoever with the proof they present, but I am having trouble formulating a generalization of this statement in the setting of differentiable manifolds. What I have in mind is: Let $Q$ be a differentiable manifold and $H\colon T^*Q \to \Bbb R$ a smooth Hamiltonian. Consider the action integral $$\mathscr{A}^H(x,{\sf p}) = \int_a^b \mathbb{F}H(x(t),{\sf p}(t)){\sf p}(t) - H(x(t),{\sf p}(t))\,{\rm d}t,$$ where $(x,{\sf p})\colon [a,b] \to T^*Q$ is a smooth curve and $\mathbb{F}H$ is the fiber derivative of $H$ , given in coordinates by $$\mathbb{F}H(x,{\sf p}) = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_k}(x,{\sf p})\frac{\partial}{\partial q^k}\bigg|_x.$$ Then if $(x,{\sf p})$ is a critical point of $\mathscr{A}^H$ and we write $$(x(t),{\sf p}(t)) = (q^1(t),\ldots, q^n(t),p_1(t),\ldots, p_n(t)),$$ we have Hamilton's equations $$\frac{{\rm d}q^k}{{\rm d}t}(t) = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_k}(x(t),{\sf p}(t)) \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad \frac{{\rm d}p_k}{{\rm d}t}(t) = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q^k}(x(t),{\sf p}(t)).$$ However, I'm not entirely sure of this, as a priori there's no relation between $x(t)$ and ${\sf p}(t)$ (except for ${\sf p}(t) \in T_{x(t)}^*Q$ ), in contrast with curves $(x(t),\dot{x}(t))$ in $TQ$ , when analyzing the Lagrangian case. In particular, I cannot reproduce the proof given in McDuff & Salamon, since there's no apparent way to use integration by parts, as we have no $t$ -derivatives in the integrand. I don't really expect anyone to fix the statement and provide the computation (although it would be nice), but I need help figuring out what sort of relation I am missing here (with that I should be able to run the computation of the first variation myself). In particular, I am not assuming that $H$ is hyperregular, and we do not have Legendre transformations at our disposal.

But Tomas Sirgedas was able to recreate some of the data. Sequence A103300 , Number of perfect rulers, has zero values at positions 135, 136, 149, 150, 151, 164, 165, 166, 179, 180, 181, 195, 196, 209, 210, 211.  The minimal rulers for these lengths have one more mark.  I have examples of all these minimal rulers, but I'd like to get counts to make a sequence ""Number of minimal sparse rulers"". The following length 69 sparse ruler has 15 marks.

3279769,Portuguese card game probabilities with a 40 card deck,"I'm working on a Portuguese card game for 4 players for a personal java project, and need help modelling. For this game, the 8's, 9's, and 10's are removed, leaving the deck with 40 cards, 10 for each suit. In each round, each player plays 1 card, in their turn. For a given player's turn, the probability I'm trying to calculate is if at least 1 player who plays after the given player's turn has at least 1 card of suit x in their hand, while having no cards of suit y . Looking at an example, player 1

                A♣ 2♥ K♦ Suppose player 3 is the first to play in this round, and suit x is ♠ (defined in the beginning of the game, it's the ""trump suit""). For y = ♣ there is at least 1 player with at least 1 ♠, while having no ♣. For y = ♥, the opposite is true, all players have ♥, regardless of having ♠ or not. The question arises from the rule that trump cards beat any card, but you have to play the same suit as the first player in the round, if you can. Players know how many cards from each suit remain because they remember which cards have been played. I think that's all the relevant information, if something is not clear, I'm happy to explain.

Then we can consider the basechange along any continuous map $g:Y'\to Y$ . Denote by $X'=X\times_Y Y'$ the base change and by $F:X'\to Y'$ and $G:X'\to X$ the natural morphisms. Then it is well known than the natural morphism $g^{-1}f_*\Rightarrow F_*G^{-1}$ is an isomorphism. Is there a similar statement for ringed spaces, i.e. when every space carries a fixed sheaf of rings $\Oo_X,\Oo_Y,\Oo_{Y'},\Oo_{X'}$ and all maps being maps of ringed spaces. We then define $g^*-=g^{-1}-\otimes_{g^{-1}\Oo_Y} \Oo_{Y'}$ .

3279942,Topological spaces in which a set is the support of a continuous function iff it is the closure of a open set.,"An exercise of Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis says: Is it true that every compact subset of $\mathbf{R}^1$ is the support of a continuous function? If not, can you describe the class of all compact sets in $\mathbf{R}^1$ which are supports of continuous functions? Is your description valid in other topological spaces? I proved that, in every metric space, a set (not necessarily compact) $A$ is the support of a continuous function if and only if it is the closure of an open set. However, I don't think that this characterization holds for every topological space. So, in order to find a counter-example, I tried to use the discrete and the trivial topologies. However, the discrete topology is metrizable and this characterization holds for topological spaces with the trivial topology. Is this result true for any topological space?

3279955,"(Proof verification) ""Partition"" of a metric space.","Before I state the proposition, I want to make the definitions clear. Definition . Let $(E,d)$ be a metric space and let $A\subseteq E$ be a subset. Define the interior of $A$ as $int(A)=\{x \in E: \exists r>0:B(x,r)\subseteq A\}$ , where $B(x,r)=\{y\in E:d(x,y)<r\}$ as usual. The exterior of $A$ is the set $ext(A)$ where $ext(A)=int(A^c)$ . The closure of $A$ is the set $cl(A)=\{x\in E:\forall r>0:B(x,r)\cap A\neq \emptyset\}$ . Finally, the boundary of $A$ is defined as $bd(A)=cl(A)\cap cl(A^c)$ . Proposition . Show that $int(A), bd(A)$ and $ ext(A)$ are disjoint sets of $E$ and their union is the whole $E$ . My attempt . I start showing that the sets cover $E$ . \begin{align}
E&=(E\setminus bd(A)) \cup bd(A)   & \\
&=bd(A)^c \cup bd(A) & \\
&=(cl(A) \setminus int(A))^c \cup bd(A)  & (\text{by } bd(B)=cl(B)\setminus int(B))\\
&=cl(A)^c \cup int(A)\cup bd(A) & \\
&=int(A^c) \cup int(A) \cup bd(A)& (\text{by } cl(B^c)=int(B)^c )\\
&=ext(A)\cup bd(A) \cup int(A).
\end{align} Hence, the desired equality. Now, I will show the disjointness of the sets. \begin{align}
x\in int(A)& \implies (\exists r>0) B(x,r)\subseteq A \\
&\implies (\exists r>0)B(x,r)\cap A^c=\emptyset \\
&\implies x\notin cl(A^c)=A^c\cup bd(A),
\end{align} since $bd(A)=bd(A^c)$ . Then $int(A)\cap (ext(A) \cup bd(A))=\emptyset$ (using the fact that $int(A^c)\subseteq A^c$ , the definition of exterior, and $B_1\subseteq B_2, B_2=\emptyset \implies B_1=\emptyset$ ).
It follows that both $(int(A)\cap ext(A))$ and $(int(A)\cap bd(A))$ are empty sets. Now \begin{align}
x\in ext(A)& \implies x\in int(A^c) \\
&\implies x\notin cl(A)=A\cup bd(A).    (\text{by the above result})
\end{align} It implies that $(ext(A)\cap bd(A))$ is also empty. This completes the proof. *My actual proof is not as detailed as the one I just decribed above.

[duplicate]","This question already has answers here : What is wrong with this funny proof that 2 = 4 using infinite exponentiation? (3 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Edit: My question has been requested to close due to its apparent lack of clarity. My question is below under "" Problem "". If the information above it is redundant, please let me know in a comment. I will try my best to make my question as clear as possible. I was looking at the equation $x^y=y$ . If I want to isolate $x$ , we would have $$x=y^{1/y}\stackrel{\small\rm{or}}{=}\sqrt[y]{y}.$$ Now let's consider $x^{x^y}=y$ . I did not know how to do this, but I noticed something at first. If we let $x^y=y$ , then this means $x^{x^y}=y\implies x^y=y$ by order of substitution. Notice that the same equation we substituted is in fact yielded; and, as mentioned previously, this equation would arrive at the fact that $x=y^{1/y}$ . If we substitute this equation in, we obtain: $$({y^{1/y}})^{(y^{1/y})^{y}}=y$$ which is clearly true. But that means... $$x^y=y\implies x^{x^y}=y\implies x^{x^{x^y}}=y\implies x^{x^{x^{x^y}}}=y\implies \cdots\tag1$$ It is now clear that we can look at this from a different perspective: if $x^y=y$ then similarly, $y=x^y$ . We can substitute this on the LHS of the former equation, therefore resulting in that $x^{x^y}=y$ . Clearly, this can be done ad infinitum, and this angle of looking at it is much easier to mentally grasp. However.... if $x^y=y$ and $x^{x^y}=y$ then this means $x^y=x^{x^y}$ which doesn't make sense. Perhaps I am missing the part that $$x^y=x^{x^y}\color{red}{\iff x^y=y}$$ for otherwise we could let $x$ and $y$ be equal to anything, even each other, in the equation $x^y=x^{x^y}$ and quickly arrive at some problems. Problem: Now I have a problem when it comes to a certain substitution. If we can carry out the implications as shown in $(1)$ forever and ever, we will get the following equation: $$x^{x^{x^{x^{x^{\,\,\style{display: inline-block; transform: rotate(60deg)}{\vdots}}}}}} =y.\tag2$$ Considering that $\sqrt[4]{4}=\sqrt{\sqrt{4}}=\sqrt{2}$ then one can quickly deduce from Eq. $(2)$ that $2=4$ which is clearly wrong. Let $y=2$ then $x=\sqrt{2}$ . Let $y=4$ then $x=\sqrt [4]{4}=\sqrt{2}$ . Thus $2=4$ . But since we just discussed the entire concept of this equation and there doesn't seem to be any flaws with it, why am I getting the absurd flaw now that $2=4$ ? Clearly I did something wrong with the substitution, but that's the easy part, so I believe I am overlooking something, something likely obvious $-$ but I don't understand!

The goal is to compute $R$ in terms of $r$ and $\theta$ , which are known. The best I have been able to get so far is an equation that combines all $3$ variables, and is therefore numerically solvable for $R$ . However it does not seem that it can be rearranged in closed form to isolate $R$ . When I posed it to Mathematica, it returned a hideous monstrosity. I am wondering if there is a more elegant geometrical approach that I'm missing to isolate $R$ in terms of $r$ and $\theta$ . Here is my work so far: If we knew $\alpha$ , the problem would be trivial. Drop the red perpendicular and observe that: $$
\cos\alpha=\frac{R-r}{R},
$$ which can be rearranged to give: $$
R = \frac{r}{1-\cos\alpha}.
$$ We do not know $\alpha$ directly, but we know that $\alpha = \theta-\beta$ , and we can compute $\beta$ in terms of $R$ and $r$ from the isosceles triangle: $$
\beta = 2\arcsin\left(\frac{r}{2R}\right)
$$ Now we plug our new expression for $\alpha$ into the above expression for $R$ and we get a nasty-looking equation with $R$ on both sides: $$
R = \frac{r}{1-\cos\left(\theta - 2\arcsin\left(\frac{r}{2R}\right) \right)}.
$$ Edit: Numerical Solutions Here is some data from numerical solutions. I have plotted $R$ vs $r$ with $\theta=\pi/3$ and $R$ vs $\theta$ with $r=1$ . It seems pretty clear that: $R$ and $r$ have a directly proportional relationship for fixed $\theta$ $R$ is inversely proportional to $\theta$ for fixed $R$ (a log-log plot looks straight)","['euclidean-geometry', 'geometry', 'closed-form', 'numerical-methods', 'trigonometry']"

Statement: Prove for every $b,x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $b\geq 1$ , $|x|\leq b$ , it holds that $$(1+\frac{x}{b})^b \geq e^{x}(1-\frac{x^2}{b}).$$ My attempt: Some cases are trivial: if $x = 0$ it holds with equality, or if $x^2\geq b$ the RHS is negative while the LHS is always positive.
For $b = 1$ , I was able to show it by separating $x>0$ and $x<0$ cases. When $b = 1$ and $x>0$ , the function $$h_b(x) = (1+\frac{x}{b})^b-e^{x}(1-\frac{x^2}{b})$$ can be easily shown to be non-decreasing by taking the derivatives and employing $e^{-x} \geq 1-x$ establishes the result. For $b = 1$ and $x<0$ the function is neither decreasing nor increasing so we can't take the derivative. Instead,  I directly worked with $h_b(x)$ and used $e^x\leq 1+x+ \frac{x^2}{2}$ for all $x<0$ to establish the results. When $b>1$ , I observed using plots that for $x>0$ the function is increasing and for when $b\geq2$ the function is decreasing for $x>0$ .

3280350,Radon-Nikodym derivative of a finitely additive measure,"I came across the following question asked in a prelims of UW. Let $(X,F,\mu)$ be a finite measure space, and $\lambda$ be a finitely-additive, non-negative, real valued set function on $F$ such that $$ \forall \epsilon >0, \exists \delta >0 : \mu(E)<\delta \implies \lambda(E)<\epsilon.$$ Show that there exists $g\in L^1(\mu)$ such that $$\lambda(E)=\int_E g d\mu.$$ The hypothesis clearly implies that $\lambda$ is absolutely continuous wrt $\mu.$ One therefore expects to invoke the Radon-Nikodym theorem. But, I know the Radon-Nikudym theorem to be tre only when $\lambda$ is also given to be a measure (I.e. countably additive). So, I tried mimicking the proof of Radon-Nikodym theorem, but I have a doubt in one step. We define $d\mu_1= d\lambda + d\mu$ . And, look at the linear functional $$f \to \int_X f d\lambda.$$ I can show that this is a bounded linear functional on $L^2(\mu_1).$ And, therefore we invoke Riesz representation theorem (?) to obtain a function $h\in L^2(\mu_1)$ such that $$\int_X f d\lambda=\int_X fh d\mu_1.$$ From this we obtain that $$\int_X f(1-h) d\lambda = \int_X fhd\mu.$$ After this step the usual procedure shows that $0\leq h\leq 1$ . And, the set on which $g=1$ is of measure 0 wrt $\mu$ and therefore wrt $\lambda.$ Replacing $f$ by $(1+h+...+h^n)f$ (We can do this because $h$ is bounded) and taking limit as $n\to \infty$ we obtain that $$\int_X f d\lambda = \int_X f \frac{h}{1-h}d\mu$$ which fives us the desired conclusion. I understand that $\mu$ being finite measure is not crucial but is helpful and simplifies things a bit. My confusion is that $d\mu_1$ is not an honest “measure” because it is only finitely additive. In this situation can we invoke RRT? 
Secondly, should the assumption of finite additivity on $\lambda$ make our life easier? I mean is it possible to write a different and hopefully simpler proof for the existence of $g$ ?","['radon-nikodym', 'measure-theory', 'absolute-continuity', 'riesz-representation-theorem']"

In the image below, the angle at any point $C$ on the highlighted arc will be $90^\circ$ if $AB$ is the diameter. Suppose now that $AB$ wasn't the diameter. Is there a theorem that says that there does not exist a point $C$ on the circle such that the angle at $C$ is $90^\circ$ ? I will use a diagram to explain my reasoning. My reasoning is as follows: if you could find me a point in the minor arc highlighted above such that $\angle ACB=90^\circ$ , then if you 'push' AB down to the diameter to get DE, the $\angle DCE < \angle ACB$ , which is a contradiction of Thales' Theorem!

3280717,"Does this ""in between"" space exist?","Let $C=C([0,1])$ be the space of continuous functions from $[0,1]$ to $\mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$ ) $B=B([0,1])$ be the space of bounded funciton from $[0,1]$ to $\mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$ ) $l_\infty$ the space of bounded sequences of real (or complex numbers) $\{q_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ an enumeration of the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ The function $$\begin{align}
 \varphi:B & \longrightarrow l_\infty\\
f & \longmapsto \varphi(f)=(f(q_1),f(q_2),\dots,f(q_n),\dots)
\end{align}$$ is onto but clearly not one-to-one. However, $\varphi$ restricted to $C$ is one-to-one because $\{q_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is dense in $[0,1]$ and the functions are continuous. But when restricted to $C$ , $\varphi$ is not onto because something like $(0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,\dots)$ is not the image of any continuous function. So is there any intermediate space $C\le X\le B$ such that the restriction $\varphi\vert_{X}$ is bijective? I have thought vaguely of some things that may work, like making the function of $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ with some limit process but now i don´t have time to check a lot of those ideas. There should be some difficulties with the fact that $\{q_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ has zero measure in $[0,1]$ so maybe instead of $B$ we should be using $L^\infty([0,1])$ . Does someone have an idea or a complete solution? Also $\varphi$ is (i strongly think but cant check now) continuous and even norm preserving on $C$ but obviously not on $B$ . Maybe we shouldn't be thinking of a subspace of $B$ but rather of $l_\infty$ ? Also, how does the enumeration change $\varphi$ ? Thanks! edit: maybe we are looking for bounded functions continuous only on the irrational numbers?",['functional-analysis']
3280736,How to call complementary sides in tiling shapes,"How mathematically can we describe the relation between two shapes which fit to each other? Is there a word in geometry for expressing that two sides of a tiling are complementary ? How to describe two figures which have a complementary sides? How can we call the curve which is common to both shapes? I am looking for any references to the common border of adjacent tiling puzzle. Please take a look at tessellation of Maurits Escher. The line forms lizards on both sides. Can you please point to any references of such a line of double creation ? If you cannot come up with any, I would be grateful for ideas of a catchy mathematical description.
