1948232,Areas of research / interest in Banach space theory today.,"Whilst taking a class in functional analysis I couldn't help but feel Banach space theory was only ever taught as a natural stepping stone towards Hilbert space theory. As to the prominence and status of Banach spaces in mathematical research today, I have several questions: Are Banach spaces still being extensively studied today - are they a sizeable area of current interest? (If I were to go to the analysis group of a university am I likely to find any of its members working on problems exclusively within the context of / to do with Banach spaces?) What types of problems are currently being investigated in the area? Are there any open problems in the area or holes in the theory of these spaces that are already known for Hilbert spaces?","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'soft-question', 'hilbert-spaces']"

1948298,"Expected value of Poisson pdf $p(a\mid X)$, where $X$ is also Poisson distributed","I had a hard time figuring out how to phrase this question, so please forgive the confusing title. To be concrete: the expected value of a function $g(X)$ of a random variable $X$, where $X$ has the pdf $f(x)$, can be computed as: $$ E[g(X)] = \int_R \! g(x) f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x $$ Now in my case, I have $$ f(x) = \mathrm{Poisson}(x\mid\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}{e^{-\lambda}} $$ and $g(x)$ is also Poisson, except its mean is $X$, so we have $$ g(x) = \mathrm{Poisson}(a\mid x) = \frac{x^a}{a!}{e^{-x}} $$ and what I want is the integral $$ E[\mathrm{Poisson}(a\mid X)] = \int_R \!  \mathrm{Poisson}(a\mid x) \mathrm{Poisson} (x\mid\lambda) \, \mathrm{d}x \\
 = \int_0^\infty \! \frac{x^a}{a!}{e^{-x}} \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}{e^{-\lambda}} \, \mathrm{d}x
$$ or the discrete version is fine as well: $$ E[\mathrm{Poisson}(a\mid X)] = \sum_x \frac{x^a}{a!}{e^{-x}} \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}{e^{-\lambda}} $$ Do either of these have an analytic solution? What if $$ \mathrm{Poisson}(a\mid x) $$ was approximated by a normal distribution? Physically this situation arises when e.g. a Poisson process produces some random number of particles, which then go on to trigger another cascade of particles, and we are interested in the pdf of the number of particles in the second cascade. So we sum over all the possible numbers of particles coming from the first process. This is straightforward to do numerically, but I just wonder if there isn't a way to do it analytically... I tried to compute it via characteristic functions but that just made it worse I think: $$ E[\mathrm{Poisson}(a\mid X)] = \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{1}{a!}\Gamma(a+1) \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} (1-i \omega)^{-a-1}\cdot e^{\lambda\left(e^{i \omega} - 1 \right)} \, \mathrm{d} \omega$$ (assuming I didn't screw up getting that far)","['statistics', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"
1948323,Integration of Gaussian noise process,"Let $\{X_t\}_{t \in \mathbb R}$ be a Gaussian noise process with $X_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ and $\phi$ a ""sufficiently nice"" function. (Say that $\phi$ is compactly supported and either smooth, continuous, or $L^2$.) I'd like to know about
$$
\int_\mathbb{R} X_t \cdot \phi(t) \, dt.
$$
Of course, this isn't really a well-posed question because that integral isn't defined. Can one explain this somehow as an Ito integral wrt a Brownian motion? If one has finitely many functions $\phi_1, \dots, \phi_n$, then what can be said about the distribution of 
$$
\mathbf x = \left( \int_{\mathbb R} X_t \cdot \phi_1(t) \, dt, \dots, \int_{\mathbb R} X_t \cdot \phi_n(t) \, dt \right)?
$$ 
I've read in the context of engineering papers/books that $\int_{\mathbb R} X_t \cdot \phi_1(t) \, dt$ follows the normal distribution $N(0, \|\phi_1 \|^2 \sigma^2)$, where $\| \cdot \|$ is the $L^2$ norm, however nothing is made rigorous, so I don't know why this is true. Does $\mathbf x$ follow a multivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix something like $\Sigma_{ij} = \sigma^2 \langle \phi_i, \phi_j \rangle$? (Here $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ is the usual $L^2$ inner-product.) I apologize that this isn't a very coherent or well-formed question, but it's all that I have to work with (after searching on stochastic processes a bit).

By using the same technique as the one used to solve the left inequality I got: $\delta = m^2 - 40 + 8n \leq 0$ By combining these two resulted inequalities I got $m \leq 48$, that is $m \in [-4\sqrt3, 4\sqrt3]$.

1948563,$\log|z|$ has no harmonic conjugate in $\Bbb C\setminus\{0\}$ – different proof,"There are a number of proofs in the Internet but I am specifically interested in the claim made by John B. Conway on page 43 of his Functions of One Complex Variable I (2nd edition). Suppose $G$ is a region in the plane and $u:G\to\Bbb R$ is harmonic, if there exists a harmonic function $v:G\to\Bbb R$ such that $f=u+iv$ is analytic in $G$ then $v$ is a harmonic conjugate $\ldots u(z) = \log |z|$ of a harmonic function on the region $G = \mathbb{C} - \{ 0 \}$ has no harmonic conjugate, indeed, if it did then it would be possible to define an analytic branch of the logarithm on $G$, and this cannot be done. The definition of an analytic function and analytic branch as given in text: Def 1 A function $f: G \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is analytic if it is continuously differentiable on $G$, where $G$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{C}$. Def 2 If $G$ is an open conncted set such that in $\mathbb{C}$ and $f: G \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a continuous function such that $z = \exp f(z)$ for all $z \in G$ then $f$ is an analytic branch of logarithm . I could only prove the latter part of the statement that it is not possible to define an analytic branch of the logarithm on $G$, which I provide below in (1), hopefully it is right. The part which I do not understand is how it is possible to define an analytic branch of the logarithm on $G$ . What am I missing? Thanks! My proof for (1): If $f$ is a branch of logarithm we require that for all $z \in G$, 
  $$ e^{f(z)} =e^{a+ib} =  e^{a(z)} e^{ib(z)} = z = |z|e^{i \theta}, $$
  where $a(z), b(z) \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\theta = \arg z$. Now $e^{a(z)} = |z| $ and $e^{ib(z)} = e^{i \theta}$. So we must have $a(z) = \log |z|$, and $b(z)= \theta + 2 \pi k(z) \in (  - \pi, \pi ] $  for some $k(z) \in \mathbb{N}$. So we obtain that 
  $$ f(z) = \log |z| +i [ \theta + 2 \pi k(z) ] $$ 
  where $k: G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$. But since $f$ is continuous (we assume $f$ is a branch) and that $G$ is connected, $k(G)$ is a connected set. Hence, $k$ is constant function. 
  We now show that there exists a sequence, $z_n \rightarrow z$ such that $f(z_n) \not \rightarrow f(z)$ so $f$ is not continuous. Consider $z = e^{i \pi} $, and the sequence of points, $z_n = e^{ i  (-1)^n  (\pi - \frac{1}{n})}$. Then 
  \begin{align*} |f(z) - f(z_n)| & = | \log 1 - \log z_n + i ( \theta - \theta_n)| \\ 
&=  | \log \bigg| \cos ( \pi - \frac{1}{n}) \bigg| + i \bigg( \pi - (-1)^n ( \pi - \frac{1}{n} )\bigg) | \\ 
&\ge | \pi - (-1)^n (\pi - \frac{1}{n} ) | \\

One idea is to flatten the triangle strip so that all triangles lie in the plane of the first triangle. The plan is to rotate the second triangle around its connecting edge with the first triangle so that it becomes in plane with the first triangle. Then I continue this method for the other triangles until all of them are in plane. Then I draw a straight line between the two points and calculate the intersections with the connecting triangle edges to get the polyline.

1948742,Is the empty set homeomorphic to itself?,"Consider the empty set $\emptyset$ as a topological space. Since the power set of it is just $\wp(\emptyset)=\{\emptyset\}$ , this means that the only topology on $\emptyset$ is $\tau=\wp(\emptyset)$ . Anyway, we can make $\emptyset$ into a topological space and therefore talk about its homeomorphisms. But here, we seem to have an annoying pathology: is $\emptyset$ homeomorphic to itself? In order to this be true, we need to find a homeomorphism $h:\emptyset \to \emptyset$ . It would be very unpleasant if such a homeomorphism did not exist. I was tempted to think that there are no maps from $\emptyset$ into $\emptyset$ , but consider the following definition of a map: Given two sets $A$ and $B$ , a map $f:A\to B$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $A\times B$ such that, for each $a\in A$ , there exists only one pair $(a,b)\in f\subset A\times B$ (obviously, we denote such unique $b$ by $f(a)$ , $A$ is called the domain of the map $f$ and $B$ is called the codomain of the map $f$ ). Thinking this way, there is (a unique) map from $\emptyset$ into $\emptyset$ ! This is just $h=\emptyset\subset \emptyset\times \emptyset$ . This is in fact a map, since I can't find any element in $\emptyset$ (domain) which contradicts the definition. But is $h$ a homeomorphism? What does it mean for $h$ to have an inverse, since the concept of identity map is not clear for $\emptyset$ ? Nevertheless, $h$ seems to be continuous, since it can't contradict (by emptiness) anything in the continuity definition ( ""pre-images of open sets are open"" )… So is $\emptyset$ homeomorphic to itself?

1948774,$\Bbb F_2[X]$ modules with 8 elements,"Problem 4. Let $\Bbb F_2$ be the field with 2 elements and let $R=\Bbb F_2[X]$. List, up to isomorphism, all $R$-modules with 8 elements. Solution. We use the classification theorem of modules over a PID. Since $R$ is a finite module, it is in particular an $\Bbb F_2$ vector space. We can write
  $$M\cong R/n_1R\oplus R/n_2 R\oplus\cdots\oplus R/n_r R$$
  for polynmials $n_1\mid n_2\mid\cdots\mid n_r$. In our case, we have $\sum_{i=1}^r\deg n_i=3$, so we have three options: $r=1,\deg n_1=3$, $r=2,\deg n_2=2$, and $r=3,\deg n_3=1$. The first case yields 8 options. For the second case, we need $n_2$ to be reducible, so we have $X(X+1),X^2,(X+1)^2$ as choices. The first choice yields 2 decompositions, and the latter choices yield 1 decomposition each, for a total of 4. For the linear case, we need the same linear term repeated thrice, which is 2 choices. Therefore there are 14 in all, listed by invariant factors below:
  $$\begin{align}
&\{X^3+(0/1)X^2+(0/1)X+(0/1)\}\\

$$d: C[0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}, \hspace{3mm}d: (f,g) \mapsto \int_0^1 |f(x)-g(x)| \,dx.$$ I am interested in showing that this function satisfies the triangle inequality axiom of a metric ($d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)$ for all $x,y,z \in C[0,1]$). How I proceeded in showing this was: Let $\, f,g,h \in C[0,1]$. Consider $$\int_0^1 |f(x)-g(x)| \,dx + \int_0^1 |g(x)-h(x)| \, dx$$
$$= \int_0^1 |f(x)-g(x)| + |g(x)-h(x)| \,dx.$$ Now by the triangle inequality for real numbers (which we accept without proof) we know that the following statement must hold for any $x \in [0,1]$ $$ |f(x)-g(x)+ g(x)-h(x)| = |f(x)-h(x)| \leq |f(x)-g(x)| + |g(x)-h(x)|.$$ $$\implies \int_0^1 |f(x)-h(x)| \leq \int_0^1 |f(x)-g(x)| + |g(x)-h(x)|,$$ which completes the proof. My question is if you feel my proof is acceptable. When I was thinking it in my head, I wasn't fully convinced but now that I actually typed it up here I actually feel it might be fine.

Then the wreath product is the semidirect product $H \rtimes G$ wrt this shifting action. It is a group of order $2^3 \cdot 3 = 24$ elements.  But this is about it how I understand this group.

At any other point, the function may differ from f (the reason I need this function is that I need to get the area under $f$ between the roots, but the integral is too complicated, and the area's value can not be directly approximated because my original f has more parameters, see ""edit""). Here is the plot of f. The function f itself fulfills the wanted property (but its integral is really ugly). So I was hoping that there was a function that has the same values in the range between the first two roots ($x=0$ and the smallest one with $x>0$), but may have a much more simple formula (and integral). The following image shows a red-colored function with (maybe) such a property: The function is defined by having the same values between the first two roots and is - aside from that - point symmetric in every root. It looks much less complex, so I'd hope the formula to be much more simple for this function. How can I construct a formula for the red-colored function? Also, is there maybe an even more simple function than the red one?

1949332,"Is there a ""good"" reason why $\left\lfloor \frac{n!}{11e}\right\rfloor$ is always even?","(A follow-up of sorts to this question .) The quantity $\left\lfloor \frac{n!}{11e}\right\rfloor$ is always even, which can be proved as follows. Using the sum for $\frac{1}{e}$, we split the fraction up into three parts: $A_n=\sum_{k=0}^{n-11} (-1)^k\frac{n!}{11k!}$ is a multiple of the even integer $10! \binom{n}{11}$, and so can be ignored. $B_n=\sum_{k=n-10}^n (-1)^k\frac{n!}{11k!}=\frac{1}{11}\sum_{k=0}^{10} (-1)^{n-k}(n)_k$. This is a finite sum of falling factorials, all of which are polynomial in $n$ with integer coefficients. So $B_n$ is of the form $\frac{P(n)}{11}$ where $P(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$ with integer coefficients. $C_n = \sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{n!}{11k!}$ is an alternating series whose terms decrease monotonically in absolute value, and so $|C_n|<\frac{n!}{11(n+1)!}<\frac{1}{11}$. Putting all this together, we can see that: Since $B_n$ is always an integer multiple of $\frac{1}{11}$ and $|C_n|<\frac{1}{11}$, $C_n$ can only affect the value of $\left\lfloor \frac{n!}{11e}\right\rfloor$ when $B_n$ is an integer. In this case it will change the parity when $C_n$ is negative (i.e., $n$ is even) and leave it alone when $C_n$ is positive. Since $P(n)=11B_n$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, $B_n$'s integer status is $11$-periodic, which means that whether $C_n$ affects the parity of $\left\lfloor \frac{n!}{11e}\right\rfloor$ is $22$-periodic. Similarly, the parity of $\lfloor B_n \rfloor$ is also $22$-periodic. So the parity of $\left\lfloor \frac{n!}{11e}\right\rfloor$ is $22$-periodic. Moreover, we can compute its first $22$ values to be:
$$
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 24, 168, 1348, 12136, 121360, 1334960, 16019530, 208253902, 2915554640, 43733319612, 699733113794, 11895462934514, 214118332821268, 4068248323604100, 81364966472082010, 1708664295913722230
$$
(a sequence which does not appear to be in OEIS). All of these are even, and so $\left\lfloor \frac{n!}{11e}\right\rfloor$ must be even for all $n$. This is not a very satisfying proof, though; in the end, it looks like we need a random $2^{22}$-fold coincidence to go our way in order to get the result we want. (In fact, that's the only place we used the specific value of $11$ in our proof at all; the rest of the proof shows that the parity of $\left\lfloor \frac{n!}{ke}\right\rfloor$ is $2k$-periodic for all positive integers $k$.) Even though $11$ was chosen arbitrarily, it looks like the heuristic probability of everything lining up falls off rapidly enough that it's surprising it all works out for any $k$ which is even that large. Can someone convince me that this fact is less surprising than it looks? I would take either a completely different proof that established the result with less case analysis, or a reason why the parity of these numbers can be expected to be non-independent...","['real-analysis', 'ceiling-and-floor-functions', 'sequences-and-series', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1949456,Are there multidimensional algebraic numbers that aren't algebraic numbers?,"Note, in the following, when I'm talking about solutions in multiple dimensions compared to ones in one dimension, what I mean is that each coordinate on its own should be considered a single-dimensional solution. So for instance, if I get $\begin{bmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
s_1\\
s_2
\end{bmatrix}$, then I consider $s_1$ and $s_2$ two separate solutions, eventhough they normally clearly are only one solution of a two-dimensional problem. This is so I can actually compare with one-dimensional solutions. The whole premise of the question wouldn't make sense if not for that. The set of algebraic numbers is the set of roots of polynomials of arbitrary degree $n$ with integer coefficients $a_i$. $$P_n{\left[x\right]} = \sum_{i = 0}^{n}{a_i x^i}\\
\mathbb{\overline{Q}_n} : \left\{ x | P_n{\left[x\right]} = 0 \right\}\\
\mathbb{\overline{Q}} : \text{values of } \mathbb{\overline{Q}_n}\text{ for any } n.$$ If you try plugging in algebraic numbers as coefficients for those polynomials, you won't find anything new. The solutions will all be algebraic numbers as well. Is this also true if you allow higher-dimensional polynomials? Say you have a polynomial of the form $a_{2 0} x^2 + a_{0 2} y^2 + a_{1 1} x y + a_{1 0} x + a_{0 1} y + a_{0 0} = 0$ where $a_{i j} \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a_{2 0}, a_{0 2}, a_{1 1}$ can't all be zero. If I'm not mistaken, this will not yet suffice since you'll get infinitely many solutions that form a $1$-dimensional subspace. So let's add a second polynomial of the same form to fix a couple points. $$\begin{align*}
a_{2 0} x^2 + a_{0 2} y^2 + a_{1 1} x y + a_{1 0} x + a_{0 1} y + a_{0 0} & = 0 \\
b_{2 0} x^2 + b_{0 2} y^2 + b_{1 1} x y + b_{1 0} x + b_{0 1} y + b_{0 0} & = 0 \\
a_{i j}, b_{i j} & \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align*}$$ and the six highest degree terms can't all be zero, so that at least one polynomial has degree $2$. As long as these equations are independent, only a discrete finite set of solutions should be left over. I declare these solutions to be two-dimensional algebraic numbers of the second degree. Are these solutions the same as (one-dimensional) algebraic numbers? By trying out this scheme for the first degree case (so just systems of linear equations), it is easy to see that the results will just be rational numbers which already are fully covered by (one-dimensional) first degree algebraic numbers (i.e. Integers and Rational Numbers). Based on that result, my hunch is that the answer to the title question will be negative: Algebraic numbers already fully cover this case for all degrees and all dimensions. But of course, the degree $1$ case is trivially represented in linear algebra, so it could easily be the case that non-algebraic solutions exist only for higher degrees. So is my hunch correct? Bonus question 1: (Assuming my hunch is right) Will higher dimensional solutions change in degree? I.e. Can I represent (one-dimensional) algebraic numbers of degree $>n$ as solutions to systems of multidimensional polynomial equations of degree $n$? Solution counting henceforth will be in the normal sense: $\begin{bmatrix}
x\\y\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}s_1\\s_2\end{bmatrix}$ is only one solution. Bonus question 2: Up to how many solutions will a system of polynomial equations of degree $n$ in $d$ dimensions generally have?","['abstract-algebra', 'roots', 'polynomials', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1949492,A curve of genus $15$ and degree $11$ is contained in a cubic surface,"I am trying to show that if $C\subseteq\mathbb{P}^3$ is a smooth curve of degree $11$ and genus $15$, then $C$ is contained in a cubic surface $S\subseteq\mathbb{P}^3$. The idea is to use the exact sequence of sheaves
$$
0 \to \ \mathcal{I}_{C}\to \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3} \to \mathcal{O}_{C} \to 0
$$
where $\mathcal{I}_{C}$ is the ideal sheaf of $C$. Twisting the exact sequence by 3, we get 
$$
0 \to \ \mathcal{I}_{C}(3)\to \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(3) \to \mathcal{O}_{C}(3)\to 0
$$
Taking the long exact sequence in cohomology and using $H^{i}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(3))=0$ for $i=1, 2$, we have
$$
0 \to \ H^{0}(\mathcal{I}_{C}(3))\to H^{0}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(3)) \to H^{0}(\mathcal{O}_{C}(3))\to H^1(\mathcal{I}_{C}(3))\to 0\to H^1(\mathcal{O}_{C}(3))\to H^2(\mathcal{I}_{C}(3))\to 0
$$
Now, by Riemann-Roch, $\dim H^0(\mathcal{O}_{C}(3))- \dim H^{1}(\mathcal{O}_{C}(3)) = 3\cdot 11 + 1 - 15 = 19$. So if $\dim H^{1}(\mathcal{O}_{C}(3))=0$, then $\dim H^0(\mathcal{O}_{C}(3))=19$. On the other hand, $\dim H^{0}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{3}}(3)) = 20$. But then, the above exact sequence (and basic linear algebra) shows that $\dim H^{0}(\mathcal{I}_{C}(3)) \geq 20-19 = 1$, so there is a degree $3$ form vanishing along $C$. In other words, the curve $C$ is contained in a cubic surface, as desired. So my question is: Why is $H^{1}(\mathcal{O}_{C}(3))=0$? The above exact sequence shows that $H^{1}(\mathcal{O}_{C}(3))=H^{2}(\mathcal{I}_{C}(3))$. So maybe it is easier to show that the latter is $0$?","['algebraic-curves', 'surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry']"

1949905,Does the Riemann zeta function converge in higher dimensions?,"It is known that the Riemann zeta function $$\displaystyle \zeta(s) = \sum_{n = 1} \frac{1}{n^s}$$ converges for all $\mathrm{Re}(s) > 1$, and admits an analytic continuation to the rest of the complex plane apart from its poles. My question concerns a generalisation of this: suppose that we replace $n$ with a vector $m \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ and consider the sum $$\displaystyle \sum_{\substack{\ \ m \in \mathbb{Z}^d} \\ {\ \  \ m \neq 0}} \frac{1}{|m|^s}.$$ Does this sum also converge absolutely for $\mathrm{Re}(s) > 1$? It clearly converges if $d = 1$. If $d = 2$, then we have: $$\displaystyle \sum_{\substack{\ \ m_1 \in \mathbb{Z}} \\ {\ \ \ m_1 \neq 0}} \sum_{\substack{\ \ m_2 \in \mathbb{Z}} \\ {\ \ \ m_2 \neq 0}} \frac{1}{|m_1 + m_2|^s}, \ \ m_1 + m_2 \neq 0.$$ It doesn't seem clear to me why this should converge. The closest I've been able to find is the so-called Hurwitz zeta function , which looks somewhat similar to my sum except that I'm summing over the parameter $q$ as well. I've tried comparing the double sum to a double integral of the same thing over $\mathbb{R}^2$, but Mathematica tells me that the resulting integral does not converge for $s = 3/2$, which is not a good sign. Using Mathematica on the sum directly -- summing over $\mathbb{N}$ rather than $\mathbb{Z}$ -- yields $\zeta(s - 1) + \zeta(s)$ for the case $d = 2$.","['number-theory', 'real-analysis', 'analytic-number-theory']"

Let $f: \Omega \rightarrow [0,+\infty[$ be a $\mathcal{G}$-measurable function, and consequently $f$ is a $\mathcal{F}$-measurable function too (obviously $[0,+\infty[$ is provided with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra). In these hypothesis, for all $B\in \mathcal{G}$ we can consider the integrals: $\int_B f d\mu$, done in the measure space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$, and $\int_B f d\mu|_\mathcal{G}$, done in the measure space $(\Omega, \mathcal{G}, \mu|_\mathcal{G})$. The question is: in general are these integrals equal? (for all $B\in \mathcal{G})$ According to the Lebesgue integral definition is: $\int_B f d\mu = \sup\{$integrals of $\mathcal{F}$-measurable simple functions $s$ such that $\forall x\in B, s(x)\leq f(x)$ $\}$ and $\int_B f d\mu|_\mathcal{G} = \sup\{$integrals of $\mathcal{G}$-measurable simple functions $s$ such that $\forall x\in B, s(x)\leq f(x)$ $\}$, so my problem is: though the measure is the same on the subsets of $B$, having more measurable sets in $F$ implies that there could be more $\mathcal{F}$-measurable simple functions and the sup could be different; i'm not sure if the $\mathcal{G}$-measurability of $f$ is enough to guarantee the equality of the integrals.
