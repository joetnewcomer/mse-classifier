745888,I would like to show that $\ell^1$ is separable,"So here is my question, I want to prove that $\ell^1$ is separable. So i need to show that there exists a countable dense subset in $\ell^1$. Since I am not sure if my idea was right i hoped someone could look over my proof. My idea was, Let $Q:=\{(x_n)\subset\mathbb Q:\exists j\in\mathbb N $ s.t $ \forall n\geq j:x_n=0\}$.
Clearly $Q$ is countable so it is left to show that $Q$ is dense in $\ell^1$. For that we will show that for all $x\in\ell^1\backslash A$ we have, $$\{y\in\ell^1:\|x-y\|_{\ell^1}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|x_n-y_n|<\epsilon\}=:B_{\epsilon}(x)\bigcap A\neq\emptyset$$
for an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$. Notice that there exists $n_0\in\mathbb N :\sum_{n=n_0}^{\infty}|x_n|<\epsilon/2$. 
Furthermore since $\mathbb Q$ is dense in $\mathbb R$, for every $x_j$ with $j\in\{1,...,n_0-1\}$ we can find $q_j\in\mathbb Q$ s.t $|x_j-q_j|<\frac{\epsilon}{(n_0-1)2}$.
For this $q_j$'s we define,
$$(q_n):=(q_1,...,q_{n_0-1},0,0,...)\in A$$
Since, $$\|x-q\|=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|x_n-q_n|=\sum_{n=1}^{n_0-1}|x_n-q_n|+\sum_{n=n_0}^{\infty}|x_n|<(n_0-1)\frac{\epsilon}{(n_0-1)2}+\epsilon/2=\epsilon$$ it follows that $\overline{A}=\ell^1$ what proves that $\ell^1$ is separble. Since I am not sure if there is no mistake I wanted to ask if someone could look over my prove and correct it if there are mistakes. Thanks a lot!","['functional-analysis', 'lp-spaces']"
745894,What does it mean to be an $L^1$ function?,"I am struggling to understand what the space $L^1$ is, and what it means for a function to be $L^1$ . A friend told me that a function $f$ is $L^1$ if $\int_\mathbb{R} |f|$ is finite.

I have looked online but the definitions seem complicated. I'm not studying a Lebesgue integration course, and I just want a basic understanding of what these spaces are. He explained the spaces as saying they contained functions that decay to zero, is this correct? Could somebody provide a simple definition/intuitive explanation for me to view these spaces, and give me some examples of functions they contain(and better yet functions they don't contain). I have never studied Lebesgue Integration, and am now taking a graduate Fourier Analysis course, so perhaps I should study it in some more detail, but for the moment I'd just like to understand a bit more about these spaces. -----EDIT-------

Everyone I ask always says either 1) it is essentially a lucky accident, 2) presents a ""counterexample"" that I usually don't think is valid, or 3) says that it can be made rigorous but that's very tedious to do... but clearly Leibniz was not in any of the three situations proposed. He must have had some reason for knowing why his notation worked so well - after all, he invented it. As for Newton, did he know the same things as Leibniz?

I was able to prove that their area is the same using the vector form of the area calculation, by taking half of the area formed by the parallelogram formed by their sides, which is calculable by the cross product of the vectors defined by the sides. However, by looking at Heron's formula, which only relies on the lengths of the sides, something (apparently) weird struck me: since I can calculate their areas simply knowing the side lengths, how have they come to have the same areas, since they share two equal sides, $AC$ and the base, but clearly $AD > AB$ ?

746135,Contradictory area elements in Cartesian and polar coordinates [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Explain $\iint \mathrm dx\,\mathrm dy = \iint r \,\mathrm \,d\alpha\,\mathrm dr$ (4 answers) Closed 4 years ago . We all know that the area element $dA$ in Cartesian coordinates is given by $$dA = dx\ dy.$$ With a bit of geometry, we can also see that the area element $dA$ in polar coordinates is given by $$dA = r\ dr\ d\theta.$$ If this is the case, when why doesn't $dx\ dy = r\ dr\ d\theta$?
By implicitly differentiating the equations $x = r \cos \theta$ and $y = r \sin \theta$, we have that $$dx = dr \cos \theta - r \sin \theta\ d\theta$$ and $$dy = dr \sin \theta + r \cos \theta\ d\theta.$$ Thus, \begin{align*}
dx\ dy &= (dr \cos \theta - r \sin \theta\ d\theta)(dr \sin \theta + r \cos \theta\ d\theta)\\
&= dr^2 \cos\theta \sin\theta+r\ dr \cos^2 \theta\ d\theta-r\ dr \sin^2 \theta\ d\theta-r^2\sin\theta\cos\theta\ d\theta^2.
\end{align*}
It is not evident to me that this expression equals $r\ dr\ d\theta$, if it does at all. Why does this discrepancy exist? Is it the case that $dA$ in Cartesian coordinates is simply not the same thing as $dA$ in polar coordinates? If so, why do both correspond to area elements in the plane?",['multivariable-calculus']

It's not hard to see that $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ and that $f$ is differentiable everywhere on $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus (\mathbb{S}^1 \cup \{0\})$. In $|x| < 1$, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(x) = \frac{-x_j}{|x|^2 (-\log(|x|)^{\frac{1}{2}})} $.  But, unless I'm missing something really obvious (and I think I am!), this isn't square integrable on $|x| < 1$ (integrating in polar coordinates reduces to evaluating something of the form $\int_0^1 \frac{1}{r \log(r)} dr$.

Can someone point me in the right direction here? Edit: Suppose that $f(x) = (- \log(|x|))^{\alpha}$ for $|x| < \frac{1}{2}$, say.  Then for $f \in L^2$, we need to have that $\int_{B(0; \frac{1}{2})} (f(x))^2 < \infty$.  Integrating in polar coordinates, that is $\displaystyle \int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} r (-\log(r))^{2 \alpha} dr < \infty$.  So we can use any value of $\alpha > 0$ here. Next, in $\{|x| < \frac{1}{2}\}$, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(x) = \alpha (-\log(|x|))^{\alpha - 1} (\frac{-1}{|x|}) \frac{x_j}{|x|} = \frac{ - \alpha x_j (-\log(|x|))^{\alpha - 1}}{|x|^2}$.

746980,$K$ events that are $(K-1)$-wise Independent but not Mutually/Fully Independent,"I had the following question: Construct a probability space $(\Omega,P)$ and $k$ events, each with probability $\frac12$, that are $(k-1)$-wise, but not fully independent. Make the sample space as small as possible. I tried to answer it, but I just couldn't arrive at a correct solution. I solved the cases for $k=3$ and $k=6$, but I didn't arrive at a correct generalization. I made two different attempts (below), in both of which I think I had the general idea, but did not create the Events correctly. Can anyone please guide me to the correct solution? Assume we are given some $k \geq 3$. If $k$ is even, proceed. If $k$ is odd, let $k=k+1$.
  First, we define $\Omega = \{A_1,\ldots,A_k\}$, ensuring that $|\Omega|$ is even. We then define the probability distribution $P$ such that $p(A_i) = \frac{1}{k} \forall i$. Because $|\Omega|$ is even and probability is uniformly distributed, we can then select $k$ subsets of $\Omega$, each of size $\frac{k}{2}$ as such:
  \begin{align*}
E_1 = \{A_1,\ldots,A_{k/2}\}\\
E_2 = \{A_2,\ldots,A_{k/2+1}\}\\
\ldots \\
E_{k/2} = \{A_{k/2},A_{k/2+1},\ldots,A_k\}\\
E_{k/2 + 1} = \{A_{k/2+1},A_{k/2+2}\ldots,A_k,A_1\}\\
\ldots\\
E_k = \{A_k,A_1,\ldots,A_{k/2-1}\}
\end{align*}
  As each event contains $\frac k2$ outcomes, and each outcome has probability $\frac 1k$, it is clear that $\forall i, P(E_i) = \sum_{a \in E_i} P(a) = \sum_{i=1}^{\frac k2} \frac 1k = \frac k2 \cdot \frac 1k = \frac12$. In other words, each event has probability $\frac 12$. We note that because all events are distinct, have size $\frac k2$, but there are $k$ events, it is the case that $E_1 \cap E_2 \cap \ldots \cap E_k = \emptyset$. (Though this is apparent just from how we have selected our events.) Consequently, $P(E_1 \cap E_2 \cap \ldots \cap E_k) = 0$. However, as each event $E_i$ has probability $\frac 12$, we have that $P(E_1)P(E_2)\ldots P(E_k) = \left(\frac 12 \right)^k \neq 0$. Since $P(E_1)P(E_2)\ldots P(E_k) \neq P(E_1 \cap E_2 \cap \ldots \cap E_k)$, it is the case that our $k$ events are not mutually/fully independent. Now all that remains is to show that the $k$ events are ($k-1$)-wise independent: this is actually not true. Sorry. And another attempt: this one is more hurried as I was running out of time... In order to ensure $(k-1)$-wise independence, we will create events as such:
  \begin{align*}
E_1 = \{A_1,A_2\}\\
E_2 = \{A_1,A_3\}\\
\ldots \\
E_{l -1} = \{A_1,A_l\}\\
E_{l} = \{A_2,A_3\}\\
E_{l+1} = \{A_2,A_4\}\\
\ldots\\
E_{2l-2} = \{A_2,A_l\}\\
E_{2l-1} = \{A_3,A_4\}\\
\ldots\\
E_k = \{A_{l-1},A_l\}\\
\end{align*}
  This means if we want $k$ events, we need some $l$ such that $k = \frac{l^2-l}{2}$. This comes down to a simple summation $\sum_{i=1}^{l-1}l-i$ that equals $\frac{l(l-1)}{2}$, i.e. $\frac{l(l-1)}{2} =k$. So knowing $k$ we find $l$ and define our sample space $\Omega = \{A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_l\}$, again with uniform probability distribution $P$ such that $\forall i, P(A_i) = \frac 1l$. Then for any pair $E_a,E_b$ we will have $P(E_a \cap E_b) = p(A_x)$, where $A_x \in \Omega$. Because of the way we created the events, any two events will share exactly $1$ or $0$ outcomes $\ldots$ and here this attempt fails as well.","['probability-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

Then they define an algebraic variety as an algebraic set where $(f_1, \dots, f_m)$ is a prime ideal in $k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$. My question has two parts: I'm guessing the distinction is like any other area of math where you try to break things up into the ""irreducible"" case and deduce the general case from patching those together. How does that happen with varieties and algebraic sets? Is it correct to conclude that every algebraic set is somehow built from algebraic varieties since the ideal $(f_1, \dots, f_m)$ is contained in some prime (maximal) ideal? How can one tell whether or not an algebraic set is a variety intuitively? I know formally you'd have to prove $(f_1, \dots, f_m)$ is prime (or perhaps there are some useful theorems out there?), but many times in texts the author simply states something is a variety without any justification. Is there a way to sort of ""eye-ball"" varieties in the sense that there are tell-tale signs of algebraic sets which are not varieties?

Let $$s_k = \left(\frac{1+a_{k+1}}{a_k}\right)^k $$ Then $s_k \geq 0$ as otherwise $a_{k+1} < -1$. Also, $\sup_{k \geq n}\{s_k\}$ is nonincreasing on $n$.

showing $6$ and then perform a new throw with the dices not showing $6$, repeating the process until all dices have shown $6$. Let $N_n$ be the number of throws before all dice have shown $6$. Set $m_n := E[N_n]$ and let $Y$ denote the number of dices not showing $6$ after the first throw. I've showed that $Y \sim b(n,\frac 5 6)$, because we can consider the throw as $n$ independent trials with succes probability $\frac 5 6$. Now I must write a recursive formula for $m_n$ and decide $m_1, \ldots, m_5$. Using the definition of expectation of a discrete RV: $E[N_n] = 1 \cdot P(N_n = 1) + 2 \cdot P(N_n = 2) + \ldots$ But this is not very recursive - Any suggestions ?","['probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation', 'probability']"
748242,Incidence Geometry Proof,How do I show that the axioms of incidence geometry follow as theorems from the following axioms. 1) There exist exactly four lines. 2) Any two distinct lines are incident with exactly one point. 3) Each point is incident with exactly two lines,"['geometry', 'logic']"
748256,How elements are defined in axiomatic set theory,"I'm trying to understand the axioms of axiomatic set theory. I'm studying this book and I didn't understand how can we define the elements of a set and the set $\{x\}$. If I define the singleton, I know how to define the finite sets using the union axiom. Afterwards, the author says The author just says: ""given any $x$ we have the singleton $\{x\}$"", which axiom he used to say that? afterwards the author says the definition of $\{x\}$, which in my opinion is wrong because using (I), $\{x\}$ should be define as $\{\{x\},\{x\}\}$. I need help Thanks in advance",['elementary-set-theory']

748322,Lagrange Method Problem,"I am from engineering background and I am currently studying calculus. I had a question from assignment to be solved from a course on coursera but I could not do it. People have posted solution in the discussion but I cannot understand it. The question is as follows: Minimize the following function using the Lagrangean method:
\begin{cases}
f(x,y) = 6x+\frac{96}{x}+\frac{4y}{x}+\frac{x}{y}\\
x+y=6
\end{cases}
Can anyone help me in understanding the approach of how to apply Lagrangean method here. Thank you.","['optimization', 'calculus', 'lagrange-multiplier', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives']"
748324,Primality of the number of obtained by concatenating the n consecutive digits,"Let $f_n$ be the number obtained by concatenating the first $n$ numbers (in base 10). For example $f_1 = 1, f_3 = 123$ and $f_{13} = 12345678910111213.$ Now if $n$ is even or divisible by $5$ then so is $f_n$ and if $n(n+1) \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ then $f_n$ is divisible by $3.$ My question is Is $f_n$ always composite? Verifying the question with a computer I get that it holds for $n$ up to $1000$ but I don't see how to prove it. It does not seem to be case that $f_n$ always has small prime divisors as for example $f_7 = 127 \cdot 9721.$ Hence I don't see any simple approach to this question.","['divisibility', 'number-theory', 'prime-factorization', 'elementary-number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"
