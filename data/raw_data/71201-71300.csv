871639,Denesting radicals like $\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1}$,"The following result discussed by Ramanujan is very famous: $$\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{9}} - \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{9}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{9}}\tag {1}$$ and can be easily proved by cubing both sides and using $x = \sqrt[3]{2}$ for simplified typing. Ramanujan established many such denesting of radicals such as $$\sqrt{\sqrt[5]{\frac{1}{5}} + \sqrt[5]{\frac{4}{5}}} = \sqrt[5]{1 + \sqrt[5]{2} + \sqrt[5]{8}} = \sqrt[5]{\frac{16}{125}} + \sqrt[5]{\frac{8}{125}} + \sqrt[5]{\frac{2}{125}} - \sqrt[5]{\frac{1}{125}}\tag {2}$$ $$\sqrt[3]{\sqrt[5]{\frac{32}{5}} - \sqrt[5]{\frac{27}{5}}} = \sqrt[5]{\frac{1}{25}} + \sqrt[5]{\frac{3}{25}} - \sqrt[5]{\frac{9}{25}}\tag {3}$$ $$\sqrt[4]{\frac{3 + 2\sqrt[4]{5}}{3 - 2\sqrt[4]{5}}} = \frac{\sqrt[4]{5} + 1}{\sqrt[4]{5} - 1}\tag{4}$$ $$\sqrt[6]{7\sqrt[3]{20} - 19} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{5}{3}} - \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{3}}\tag{5}$$ $$\sqrt[6]{4\sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{3}} - 5\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{3}}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{9}} - \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{9}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{9}}\tag{6}$$ $$\sqrt[8]{1\pm\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{24}}} = \frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\,\frac{\sqrt[4]{5}\pm 1}{\sqrt{2}}\tag{7}$$ with the last one found in Ramanujan's Notebooks , Vol 5, p. 300. Most of these radical expressions are units (a unit is an algebraic integer $\alpha$ such that $\alpha\beta = 1$ where $\beta$ is another algebraic integer). For me the only way to establish these identities is to raise each side of the equation to an appropriate power using brute force algebra and then check the equality. However for higher powers (for example equation $(2)$ above) this seems very difficult. Is there any underlying structure in these powers of units which gives rise to such identities or these are mere strange cases which were noticed by Ramanujan who used to play with all sorts of numbers as a sort of hobby? I believe (though not certain) that perhaps Ramanujan did have some idea of such structure which leads to some really nice relationships between units and their powers. I wonder if there is any sound theory of such relationships which can be exploited to give many such identities between nested and denested radicals.","['nested-radicals', 'algebra-precalculus', 'roots', 'contest-math', 'radicals']"

($\phi_{\lambda}(x)=\lambda^{-1} \phi(x/\lambda).$),"For $f\in L^{1}(\mathbb R),$ we define its Fourier transform as follows: $\hat{f}(t)=\int_{\mathbb R} f(x) e^{-ix\cdot t} dx ,(t\in \mathbb R).$ Suppose that $f\in L^{1}(\mathbb R)$ with $\hat{f}(0)=1.$ Let $\phi\in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb R),$ (Schwartz space).
For $\lambda >0,$ we define, $\phi_{\lambda}(x)=\lambda^{-1} \phi(x/\lambda).$
Then $\|\phi_{\lambda}- \phi_{\lambda} \ast f \|_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)}\to 0$ as $\lambda \to \infty.$ [Since $\hat{f}(0)=1,$ for $x\in \mathbb R,$ we have, $\phi_{\lambda}(x)-\phi_{\lambda}\ast f(x) = \int_{\mathbb R} f(y) (\phi_{\lambda}(x)-\phi_{\lambda}(x-y)) dy;$ so $\|\phi_{\lambda}-\phi_{\lambda}\ast f\|_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)} \leq \int_{\mathbb R} |f(y)|(\int_{\mathbb R}\lambda^{-1}|(\phi(x/\lambda)- \phi ((x-y)/\lambda)| dx) dy= \int_{\mathbb R}|f(y)|( \int_{\mathbb R} (\phi(z)-\phi(z-\lambda^{-1}z)| dz)dy$ ;and the inner integral is at most $2\|\phi\|_{L^{1}},$ and it tends to zero for every $y\in \mathbb R,$ as $\lambda \to \infty.$ Hence by dominated convergence theorem, we get, $\|\phi_{\lambda}- \phi_{\lambda} \ast f \|_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)}\to 0$ as $\lambda \to \infty.$] My Question is : (1) Suppose $f\in L^{2}(\mathbb R)$ with $\hat{f}(0)=1.$ Then can we expect, 
  $\|\phi_{\lambda}- \phi_{\lambda} \ast f \|_{L^{2}(\mathbb R)}\to 0$ as $\lambda \to \infty  ?$
  (2) If answer is yes, can we expect similar result for other $L^{p}$ ? Edit : It is well-known that, for $f\in L^{p}, (1\leq p <\infty),$ we have $\|f-\phi_{\lambda}\ast f\|_{L^{p}} \to 0$ as $\lambda \to 0.$ (Bit roughly speaking, approximate identity )","['fourier-analysis', 'lp-spaces', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
871701,Finite Difference Discretization of Darcy's law and solving with Picard method,"I am trying to discretize Darcy's Law using finite differences and then solving the resulting linear system of equations with the Picard method. So far only in 1D and the steady-state (no time derivatives). Darcy's law reads:
$$C(h)\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = \nabla\cdot\left(K(h)\nabla h\right) + \frac{\partial K(h)}{\partial z}$$
the left hand side is zero, since I am (so far) only interested in the steady state. Using finite differences with $K$ and $h$ values located at the cell centers, I get:
$$0=\frac{K_{i+1/2}\left(\frac{h_{i+1}-h_{i}}{dz}\right)-K_{i-1/2}\left(\frac{h_{i}-h_{i-1}}{dz}\right)}{dz} + \frac{K_{i+1}-K_{i-1}}{2dz}$$
now I replace $K_{i+1/2}$ and $K_{i-1/2}$ by interpolation terms:
$$0=\frac{\frac{K_{i}+K_{i+1}}{2}\left(\frac{h_{i+1}-h_{i}}{dz}\right)-\frac{K_{i}+K_{i-1}}{2}\left(\frac{h_{i}-h_{i-1}}{dz}\right)}{dz} + \frac{K_{i+1}-K_{i-1}}{2dz}$$
and simplify it to:
$$0=\frac{1}{2dz^2}\left[h_{i-1}\left(K_{i-1}+K_i\right)-h_i\left(K_{i-1}+K_i+K_{i+1}\right)+h_{i+1}\left(K_i+K_{i+1}\right)+K_{i+1}dz-K_{i-1}dz\right]$$ I believe that until here things are okay, correct me if I'm wrong. Now I transform the above equation into a linear system of equations. At the top (between $h_N$ and $h_{N+1}$) there are Dirichlet boundary conditions with $h_{N+1/2}=h_B$ and at the bottom (between $h_0$ and $h_1$) there are neumann boundary conditions $\nabla h_{1/2}=0$:

871728,Diagonal of pseudoinverse of Laplacian matrix,"I have to find the diagonal of the pseudoinverse of a Laplacian matrix evaluated on a directed and weighted graph. My Laplacian is defined as $L=D-A$ , where $D$ is a diagonal matrix (with $D_{i,i}$ being the sum of the weights of in or out edges from node $i$ ) and $A$ is the adjacency matrix where $A_{i,j} = \operatorname{weight}(i,j)$ . My Laplacian is quite big, about $20$ k * $20$ k and hence its pseudoinversion requires about $10$ hours with the Python scipy.pinv $2$ command and a lot of RAM, over $15$ GB. I need only the diagonal entries of this matrix. 
Is there any mathematical rule that I can use in order to avoid the evaluation of the entire pseudoinverse?

871740,"How does the integral $\int_{D_C} e^{ia z}P(z)/Q(z)\,\mathrm{d}z$ blow up.","In my book I have a theorem that goes something like the following Let $P(x)$ be $Q(x)$ polynomials such that $\deg(Q) \geq \deg(P) + 2$.
  Then \begin{align*} 	\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}
 e^{iax} \,\mathrm{d}x 	= 2 \pi i \frac{a}{|a|} \sum_{k=1}^{m} \mathrm{Res}\left[
 \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} , z_k \right] \end{align*} where $a$ is a real
  constant and $z_1,\,\ldots\,,z_m$ are the singularities to $P(x)/Q(x)$ in
  the upper halfplane if $a>0$ and the lower halfplane if $a<0$. I am having a bit of problems understanding this. I know the reason why we have to switch contour is that $e^{iz}$ blows up. But I really can not see why or how it blows up. Take the canonical example for why this theorem is useful 
$$
  J = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{iz}}{z^2+1}
$$ Now the clue here is to show that the integral along the curve tends to zero, and then use the residue theorem. To show that the integral tends to zero I did this
\begin{align*}
	\left| \int_{C_1} \frac{e^{iz}}{1+z^2} \,\mathrm{d}z\right|
	\leq \int_{C_1} \left| \frac{e^{iz}}{1+z^2} \right| \,\mathrm{d}z 
	\leq \sup_{z = R e^{i \theta}} \left( \frac{1}{\left|1+z^2\right|} \right)
	     \int_{C_1} |e^{iz}| \,\mathrm{d}z
\end{align*}
where the $ML$-inequality was used in the last inequality 
On the circle with radius $R$ we have $|e^{iz}|=R$, and we can use
the inequality $|a+b|\leq|a|-|b|$ to simplify further
\begin{align*}
	\left|\int_{D_R} \frac{e^{iz}}{1+z^2}\,\mathrm{d}z \right|
	\leq \sup_{z = R e^{i \theta}} \left( \frac{1}{|z|^2-1}\right)
	\int_{D_R} R \,\mathrm{d}z
	\leq \pi \frac{R}{R^2-1}
\end{align*}
which tends to zero as $R \to \infty$ as wanted.
but if one instead had $e^{-iz}$ then the theorem states that one has to use the lower half plane. But I do not see where my calculations err if one persists in using the contour in the upper half plane? What goes wrong, and why does it go wrong? $|e^{-iz}|$ should still be $R$ on the semi-circle. How can one formally show that the integral diverges when picking the contour as a semi circle in the lower half plane?","['integration', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"
871770,Why do only fixed points contribute to the Euler characteristic?,"Let $G$ be an algebraic group with zero Euler characteristic, acting on a variety $X$ (over $\mathbb C$). I read some time ago that then the Euler characteristic of $X$ can be computed as
$$\chi(X)=\chi(X^G),$$ where $X^G$ is the locus of fixed points. What is a proof of this fact? Attempt : one can decompose $X$ as a disjoint union of $X^G$ and the set
$$S=\coprod G.x,$$ the union being on nontrivial orbits $G.x\neq\{x\}$. If I show that $\chi(G.x)=0$ for every orbit appearing in the decomposition of $S$, we are done. But I can't. I initially thought that each such orbit is the base of a locally trivial fibration 
$$G\times\{x\}\to G.x$$ with fiber $G_x$, the stabilizer of the point $x$ (The map being just the restriction of the action $G\times X\to X$). First, I  am not sure this is true in the context of actions by algebraic groups. Second: even if it were true, it would just tell me (using that $\chi(G)=0$) that 
$$0=\chi(G)=\chi(G.x)\chi(\textrm{fiber})=\chi(G.x)\chi(G_x),$$ but this does not quite allow me to concude that $\chi(G.x)=0$, because $\chi(G_x)$ might be zero as well. Can anyone help me figuring out how to fix the argument, or provide a proof? Thank you!",['algebraic-geometry']

I tried looking at a number like $n=10$ just to see what it looks like expanded.  So since the divisors of $n$ are $1,2,5,$ and $10$ , I can show that $$\sum_{d|10}{\mu{(d)}d(d)}=(-1)^{\omega{(10)}}=\mu(1)d(1)+\mu(2)d(2)+\mu(5)d(5)+\mu(10)d(10)=1$$ This gives me $$1\cdot 1+-1\cdot 2+-1\cdot 2 +1\cdot 4 $$ I'm thinking somehow since both $\mu$ and $d$ are multiplicative that we can rewrite though as $$\mu(1)d(1)+\mu(2)d(2)+\mu(5)d(5)+\mu(2)d(2)\mu(5)d(5)$$ $$=\mu(1)d(1)+\mu(5)d(5)+\mu(2)d(2)+\mu(2)d(2)\mu(5)d(5)$$ $$=\mu(1)d(1)+\mu(5)d(5)+\mu(2)d(2)(1+\mu(5)d(5))$$ $$=\mu(1)d(1)+\mu(5)d(5)+\mu(2)d(2)(\mu(1)d(1)+\mu(5)d(5))$$ $$=(1+\mu(2)d(2))(1+\mu(5)d(5))$$ $$=\sum_{d|2}{\mu(d)d(d)}\sum_{d|5}{\mu(d)d(d)}$$ So this original summation function is multiplicative.  But this isn't helping me see the how to move forward.

871996,Evenly space holes in circle,"A picture is worth a thousand words: This gear is part of an interactive SVG Spirograph I'm creating.  I'm dynamically generating the gear based on a number of parameters (gear radius, number of teeth, etc).  Notice how the holes scrunch up as they get close to the center?  It's because I'm currently spacing the holes by a constant angle, and as they get close to the center, that angle doesn't move each hole very far. Real-life Spirograph gears space their holes so that they appear equidistant from each other, even as they get close to the center: My attempt to emulate this effect was partially successful - instead of spacing each hole by an absolute angle, I took the arc length between the first two holes and the last two holes and averaged them.  I then moved each hole by this average arc length.  This looks much better: However, notice that the holes now wrap further around the gear - they sweep through about 450 degrees instead of exactly 360, like in the first image.  This ""sweep distance"" is something I accept as a parameter when I create a gear, so I'd like it to accurately reflect the value passed in. I'm assuming there's something wrong with how I'm calculating the average arc length - just averaging the smallest and largest arc length is probably an oversimplification that's resulting in extra spacing between the holes.  Is there a better algorithm that will evenly space the holes around the gear while maintaining the correct ""sweep distance""?","['geometry', 'recreational-mathematics']"

872278,What is the difference between $E[X\mid Y]$ vs $E[X\mid Y=y]$ and some of the properties of $E[X \mid Y]$?,"I was trying to understand both intuitively and rigorously what the difference between $E[X\mid Y]$ vs $E[X\mid Y=y]$. Let me tell you first the things that do make sense to me. $E[X\mid Y=y]$ makes sense to me (I think). For me it means the value that we expect $X$ to have on average given that the event $Y=y$ was observed and it has deterministic value: $$E[X\mid Y=y] = \sum_x{xp_{X\mid Y}(x\mid y)} = \mu_{X\mid Y=y}$$ that can be computed like any other expectation (where the notation $\mu_{X\mid Y=y}$ denotes the actual real number that $E[X\mid Y=y]$ takes). $E[X\mid Y=y]$ is a function of y. Given $Y=y$, the conditional expectation will always be $\mu_{X\mid Y=y}$, which is governed by what specific y was observed. However, $E[X\mid Y]$ makes less sense to me. I have read something similar to the following: Notice now that Y is a random variable this time. Therefore, $E[X\mid Y]$ is a random variable. That sort of makes sense to me because, if $Y$ is random then the expected value of $X$ has to be random too. In other words, $Y$ being random, then consequently $E[X\mid Y]$ is random too. The statement $E[X|Y]$ is a r.v. and is the exact statement I would like to understand more precisely. I feel I understand less and I would like to address it. I feel if I really understood this concept of what $E[X\mid Y]$ really means, I should be able to answer the following questions: 1) If $E[X\mid Y]$ is random, then, what are the possible values it can take? Can it only take the values $\mu_{X\mid Y=y}$ for $y \in Y$? Say if $Y=\{1,2,3\}$ and $U_{X,Y} = \{\mu_{X\mid Y=1}= 11, \mu_{X\mid Y=2} = 22, \mu_{X\mid Y=3} = 33 \}$. Then is there any chance that $E[X\mid Y] = 123$? 2) Is the distribution of $E[X|Y]$ over $U_{X,Y}$ or over $Y$? 3) What is the probability distribution of $E[X\mid Y]$ if we have all the information we need about the distributions of $p_X(x)$ and $p_Y(y)$? Is it just the same as $p_Y(y)$? Is there a closed/specific formula for it? 4) When one is asked to find the distribution of $E[X\mid Y]$ are we asked to find $Pr[E[X\mid Y=y]]$ or $Pr[E[X\mid Y] = \mu]$? Is there a difference between the two? Is one nonsense while the other one is a valid probability distribution? 5) If we were to sketch the probability density function for $E[X \mid Y]$, would the horizontal axis be $y$ or $\mu$ ? i.e. would the probability density be a function of $y$ or of $E[X\mid Y] = \mu$? i.e. would $p_{E[X\mid Y]}(k)$ be a function of $y=Y$ or $E[X\mid Y]$? 6) Related to the above two question, it seems to me that writing an explicit formula for $E[X\mid Y=y]$ is easy, while for $E[X\mid Y]$ it is not (or at least for me). Is the formula $E[X\mid Y] = \sum_x{xp_{X\mid Y}(x\mid Y)}$? I would guess it is but for me its a very strange equation because we are conditioning on a random variable, or we are saying given $Y$, but $Y$ is random so its really not given.

872411,Can regression to the mean explain the unexpected underperformance (per player-rating) of girls against boys on chess?,"I'm somewhat mathematically illiterate, I'd appreciate some help in order to satisfy a curiosity. Concise summary attempt: chess ratings are derived from past performance and therefore thought to be good predictors of future performance, odds of the match according to the ratings of the opponent. Men are ""on average"", better chess players than women, but it would still be ""predicted"" that odds of a match between a man and a woman would be ""dictated"" only by their ratings. But a psychological finding was that girls underperformed in matches against boys. The hypothesized psychological explanation is that girls, being stereotypically worse than boys (and, in fact, worse on average), are excessively stressed, intimidated in such matches, and perform worse than when competing against other girls. A commenter on a blog suggested that this explanation isn't needed, that the finding can be explained just by regression towards the mean. This explanation doesn't seem to make sense to me, just as (intuitively, and I could be wrong) I wouldn't expect a similar finding in a random small group of chess players which also had a smaller average score -- the individual ratings would still be more predictive than ""belonging"" to this group, I'd bet. I also think I've read once that regression towards the mean could the explanation in the opposite direction, that women aren't ""really"" worse than men on average, that it's just a mathematical artifact of there being way fewer female chess players. It couldn't work both ways, could it? Not so concise. :-/ Following there's the post I wrote before, with perhaps some still relevant points, additional explanation of my ""reasoning"", and hopefully not terrible to read. Chess has a fairly interesting rating system, that is roughly (perhaps ""roughly"" underscores it) an estimate of performance, and that ""predicts"" odds of next performance, according to the rating of the opponent. Chess players gain or lose points according to the rating difference of the adversary, and the result. The higher are the odds against the winner (per higher rating of the adversary), the higher the winner's ratings are increased. One can even score points by drawing with a significantly stronger opponent (perhaps with ""any"" stronger opponent, but only a negligible increase the closer the ratings are). And likewise, the higher were the odds favoring someone who loses, the more the loser's rating is decreased. A psychological study has found that girls, in gender-mixed tournaments (which I guess are the majority[*]) underperform when playing against boys, according to this system. The theoretical psychological explanation is ""stereotype threat"", that psychological stress makes people perform significantly worse in situations that evoke stereotypes about the inferior performance of their group, like ""girls aren't good at chess"", or even mildly improve, in positive stereotypes. http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2014/01/girls-underperform-when-they-play-chess.html One of the commenters on the blog suggested that it's just the expected from regression towards the mean, given that women, in general, have lower ratings than men (that's a fact, not questioned here). But can it really explain this finding? Would it also be expected that by sorting random groups of players (can be all men, compared only against men, or computers/chess engines), only adding up to a similar a lower average rating of that group (or perhaps preferably a similar rating distribution ), and looking at their matches, find that individuals on this group are ""more likely"" to have underperformed, as expected from their ratings? It strikes me just as odd as saying that somehow Kasparov has a ""higher chance"" of underperforming if I, a weak chess non-player, enter the same tournament, and we're wearing the same shirt color. And at the same time I'd not play any better, even if everybody with other shirt colors are bad enough to have together a lower average than the embarrassing ""Kasparov and I"" average. That is, a random, smaller group, only with a lower average rating wouldn't obviously affect the performance of any individual player (good or bad). But would it somehow be saying anything about odds of individuals within that group? Perhaps something like boys, heavy-metal fans only, would be expected to still often have shorter hair length when compared to girls? While that doesn't seem that unlikely, I'm not sure it's quite analogous with the expectations of the rating mechanism. [*] the proportion can have a role explaining the disparity, as the ratings of female-only tournaments could be inflated. But again I'm not sure it's that much significative, I think it would be similar for any proportionally weak ""beginner/weaker player tournaments"". And there would be many more weaker boys than girls in absolute numbers, if that levels things up. I'm not sure of anything really. I just think that such think would have an effect at national levels, that is, weak countries with inflated endogenous ratings, but I've never heard of that. It's also perhaps worth mentioning that the full range of potential explanations isn't in question here (it even sort of goes against the site's rules), the scope should be whether just random below-average groupings would allow us to predict a lower average performance for individuals within that group, even when that wouldn't be expected without such grouping, somehow. Or whether somehow these are mathematically different propositions, an invalid analogy. For me it's just utterly counter intuitive, seems plain wrong, but in the other hand, like many other people, I also thought that it wouldn't make a difference to chose the other door or not on the Monty Hall dilemma. I'm sorry for the length of the post.",['statistics']

Using the ""product-to-sum"" identity $\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)=\frac{1}{2}[\cos(\alpha-\beta)+\cos(\alpha+\beta)]$ to derive the ""sum-to-product"" identity $\cos(\alpha)+\cos(\beta)=2\cos(\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2})\cos(\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2})$: I begin by rearranging the ""product-to-sum"" identity: $\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)=\frac{1}{2}[\cos(\alpha-\beta)+\cos(\alpha+\beta)]$ $2\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)=\cos(\alpha-\beta)+\cos(\alpha+\beta)$ $\cos(\alpha-\beta)+\cos(\alpha+\beta)=2\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)$ From comparing the two identities: The ""product-to-sum"" identity: $\cos(\alpha-\beta)+\cos(\alpha+\beta)=2\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)$ The ""sum-to-product"" identity: $\cos(\alpha)+\cos(\beta)=2\cos(\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2})\cos(\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2})$ By comparing the two functions it is apparent that:$\alpha=\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}$, $\beta=\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}$ This confuses me as I simplify to get: $\alpha=\beta$ and $3\beta=\alpha$, which sounds absurd..

872783,Riemannian Metric Notation,"I am just being introduced to Riemannian metrics, and I am having a bit of confusion on the notation.  When reading, I've encountered some different notation in different sources, so I want to make sure I'm understanding what the different notation means.  I'm sure there are lots of misunderstandings in what follows, so I'd appreciate if someone could correct them. Say for example we have $\mathbb{R}^2$ in canonical coordinates, and we're going to use the usual dot product $\langle x,y \rangle = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2$, where $x=(x_1,x_2)$ and $y=(y_1,y_2)$.  Then the Riemannian metric would be the $2 \times 2$ identity matrix, so that $$\begin{pmatrix} x_1 & x_2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix} = x_1y_1+x_2y_2,$$ so $g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$.  This notation makes sense to me, but I am confused about the notation $g = dx^2+dy^2$.  Do $dx$ and $dy$ denote linear functionals in the dual space?  And if they do, then is $dx = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $dy = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$?  This doesn't seem right, because the dimensions of the matrices wouldn't come out correctly. Then say we want to convert this to polar coordinates, so $x=r \cos \theta$ and $y=r \sin \theta$.  Then do we have $$g = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & r^2 \end{pmatrix} = dr^2 + r^2 d \theta^2?$$  Then to get the inner product, we would do $$\begin{pmatrix} r_1 & \theta_1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & r^2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} r_2 \\ \theta_2 \end{pmatrix} = r_1r_2 + r^2 \theta_1 \theta_2?$$  If this is correct, then what does the $r^2$ in the metric represent in the calculation?  Is it the $r$ that corresponds to the point at which we're defining the metric?  Like, if we wanted $\langle v,w \rangle$ where $v = (3,\pi/2)$ and $w = (5,\pi/4)$, what does the expression $$\langle v,w \rangle = 3 \cdot 5 + r^2 \cdot \dfrac{\pi}{2} \cdot \dfrac{\pi}{4}$$ mean, intuitively? Thanks in advance for the help. P.S. Other examples, or links to well-explained other examples would be much appreciated.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

872860,General Pigeonhole Principle - Coin Flips,"I am trying to solve a problem using the general Pigeonhole Principle. The problem statement is as follows: A coin is flipped three times and the outcomes recorded. 
  So, HTT might be recorded for 1 round of 3 flips. How many times must we
  flip a coin three times to be guaranteed that there are two identical outcomes? I am struggling to understand the correct way to solve this problem. When I use the formula: $$ N = k(r - 1) + 1 $$ Where k = 2 for the number of identical outcomes we want, r =  3 for the number of coin flips, I get 5. The answer in my book is written as 9. When I multiply the $$ k(r - 1) $$ part of the equation by 2 and then add 1, I am able to get this answer, but I feel like I am just doing this without any real understanding of what's going on. I thought maybe it's related to the outcome of each individual coin flip (H or T), but I just don't have a firm grasp on this yet. Any hints or guidance with this is greatly appreciated.","['pigeonhole-principle', 'discrete-mathematics']"
872883,Upward continued fractions,"Has anybody seen ""upward continued fractions"", such as
$$
\frac{1+\large{\frac{1+\large{\frac{1+...}{a_2}}}{a_1}}}{a_0} \quad?
$$ These can be formed, for any real number $x$ with $0<x\le 1$, by defining $x_0:=x$ and inductively 
$$
a_n:=\lfloor{x_n}\rfloor+1\qquad\text{and}\qquad x_{n+1}:=a_nx_n-1.
$$
It is easy to check that $1\le a_1\le a_2\le a_3\le\dots$, and that the sequence of $a_i$'s is eventually constant if and only if $x$ is rational.  This procedure yields expressions like the one displayed above, since
$$
x = \frac{1+x_1}{a_0}=\frac{1+\large{\frac{1+x_2}{a_1}}}{a_0}
=\frac{1+\large{\frac{1+\Large{\frac{1+x_3}{a_2}}}{a_1}}}{a_0} = \cdots

872885,Question on $x$-section of measurable rectangle in product measure space $X \times Y$,"I'm reviewing my analysis notes.  We have that $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ and $(Y, \tau, \nu)$ are complete measure spaces.  We are considering the product measure space $(X \times Y, \Sigma(\lambda^{*}), \lambda)$. Basically, if $R = A \times B$, where $A \in \Sigma$ and $B \in \tau$, we define the $x$-section of $R$ as $$R_{x} = \{ y \in B \mid (x, y) \in A \times B \}.$$ If we consider $F$ to be a union of these $R$'s (i.e., $F = \bigcup \limits_{j = 1}^{\infty} R_{j}$), then my professor defines $F_{x} = \bigcup \limits_{j = 1}^{\infty} ((A_{j} \times B_{j})_{x})$. Now, I think $\bigcup \limits_{j = 1}^{\infty} ((A_{j} \times B_{j})_{x})$ should be equal to $\bigcup \limits_{j = 1}^{\infty} B_{j}$, but in the notes, we have it equal to $\bigcup \limits_{x \in A_{j}} B_{j}$.  I'm not even sure what this union over $x \in A_{j}$ means in this context, let alone why it is equal to our $x$-section.  Any help would be appreciated.","['measure-theory', 'analysis']"

872942,Fun Geometric Series Puzzle,"I recently was reminded of a puzzle I solved in college and thought I'd give it a shot again. However, being distanced from college math, I am having a harder time remembering how I arrived at the solution. The problem is as follows: Imagine you are standing in the middle of an open field. You walk forward 16 feet, turn right and walk 8 feet, turn right and walk 4 feet, and so on. This continues indefinitely. When you finally reach an infinite number of turns, how far will you be from your original starting point (as the crow flies)? Generalized, here is what the problem looks like: I did manage to find the original solution that I came up with for the problem. However, I did not show my work so the process is lost. After attempting to resolve this without any luck, I thought I would toss this out to the community to solve as a fun puzzle.

872952,Prove: A group $G$ is abelian if and only if the map $G\rightarrow G$ given by $x\mapsto x^{-1}$ is an automorphism.,"Problem: A group $G$ is abelian if and only if the map $G\rightarrow G$ given by $x\mapsto x^{-1}$ is an automorphism. Prove it. Solution: $(\Rightarrow)$ If $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$, then $x_1^{-1}=x_2^{-1}\Rightarrow x_2=x_1$, by multiplying both sides by $x_1x_2$ and the assumption that $G$ is commutative. Thus $f$ is injective. Also, since $G$ is a group, $\forall x\in G, \exists x^{-1}\in G; xx^{-1}=e_G$ which proves that $f$ is surjective. $(\Leftarrow)$ $\forall x,y\in G; xy=\Big((xy)^{-1}\Big)^{-1}=f\Big(f(xy)\Big)=f(y^{-1}x^{-1})$, but since $G$ is a automorphism (and therefore a homomorphism), $xy=f(y^{-1})f(x^{-1})=yx \square$ Anything wrong with the solution?","['group-homomorphism', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups']"
