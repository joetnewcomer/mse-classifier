4008158,Is there a closed form for this recursion equation?,"Given $$f(a)=\frac{1}{6} \sum _{i=1}^6 \left[1-(1-f (a-1)) \left(\frac{i}{6}\right)^a\right]$$ with $f(1)=0$ , $a\in\mathbb{N}$ and $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{Q},$ is there a way to write a closed form solution for the above recursion function. I am conducting a research and obtained the above result, but was interested if a function of $f(a)$ only in terms of $a$ exists, for arbitrary $a$ . This would save a lot of computational work for my research. This in fact, is a small result which will be used in more complex calculations, therefore a closed form would be optimal.

4008165,"$(0,1)$ without union of intervals centered at rational numbers","Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence of all rational numbers in $(0,1)$ and let $$\mathscr{I}_t:=\bigcup_i\left(a_i-\frac{t}{2^{i+1}},a_i+\frac{t}{2^{i+1}}\right)\bigcap\,(0,1)\text{.}$$ Then $\lambda(\mathscr{I}_t)\leq t$ because $\displaystyle\sum_n\frac{t}{2^n}=t$ where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure. That means $\mathscr{I}_t\subsetneq(0,1)$ for $t<1$ . I'm trying to understand what $(0,1)\setminus\mathscr{I}_t$ looks like and in which way it depends on the enumeration of the rationals. My thoughts: Obviously it would only contain irrational numbers. Any $x\in(0,1)\setminus\mathscr{I}_t$ has to satisfy $\mid x-a_i\mid\geq\frac{t}{2^{i+1}}\forall i$ .

4008196,Defining loops: why is divisibility and identitiy implying invertibility?,"Wikipedia contains the following figure (to be found, e.g. here ) in order to visualize the relations between several algebraic structures. I highlighted a part that I find especially interesting. It seems to suggest that a loop can be defined either as a magma with identity and invertibility, or as a magma with identity and divisibility. It is easy to see that from 1. follows 2. But I have trouble proving the converse. Here is a proof for the case that the loop is finite: By divisibility $xa=xb\implies a=b$ for all $x,a,b\in L$ . Thus, the map $a\mapsto xa$ is injective. If the loop is finite, the map is also surjective. Thus, there is a $x'\in L$ with $xx'=e$ . This $x'$ is therefore the inverse of $x$ . But what if $L$ is not finite?","['magma', 'quasigroups', 'abstract-algebra', 'inverse', 'group-theory']"
4008243,Combinatorics Problem on proving that a particular sum is 0,"I'm having some issues with proving that the following sum is $0$ for any value of $n \geq 2$ : $$

\frac{1}{(a_{3}-a_{1})(a_{2}-a_{1})}+\frac{1}{(a_1-a_2)(a_3-a_2)}+\frac{1}{(a_1-a_3)(a_2-a_3)} = 0,

4008251,Calculating probability of next event given remaining count and range for each,"(Apologies if my use of terms is off - I am not a mathematician by trade and what I did learn way back was in a different language) What I know:
the total length of the stream, the body of possible events, the pop-count for each event, and the range of each event (essentially the index of the last instance of this event). What I want:
Given an incoming stream of events I am trying to predict what the next event is likely to be, i.e. calculate the probability of the next event being a particular one of the known population. Example: Let's say the incoming stream is ABABCCCC (not known by the receiver) Known by the receiver: Length=8

   Count Range 
A: 2     3     
B: 2     4     
C: 4     8 Ignoring the range component we can trivially calculate the probability of each event by dividing its pop-count into the total message length: Count Range Prob
A: 2     3     0.25
B: 2     4     0.25
C: 4     8     0.50 When looking at the range we can calculate the local probability of each event being next (by local I mean considering only the current event). Count Range Local prob
A: 2     3     2/3 = 0.6666
B: 2     4     2/4 = 0.5
C: 4     8     4/8 = 0.5 But how do I combine the two types of probability into one value without enumerating all combinations and testing each one to see if it matches the constraints? It's obvious from inspection that in this particular case the probability of the next event being a C is 0.0 here as having anything but A or B as the first event would prevent all of the As and Bs from occurring within their range, but it's not clear to me what the formal calculation should look like. - Some more context: In the real scenario, number of unique events can run into the low thousands while the stream length can be up to a few billions while the million range will be more typical. I can pre-calculate a few incoming events essentially for free so I want to pick the most probably one(s) for that in an attempt to save overall cost. Events can come and go - one of the static events is Define New Event - I did not include this fact initially because it does not affect the issue at hand. Sometimes all live ranges will be so long that the individual ranges don't matter - I can just go with the straight probability based on pop-count alone, but every once in a while there'll be short bursts of events that are short-lived but whose probability will locally exceed those of the longer-lived, more populous events. Calculation does not have to be exact - if I can calculate a reasonable trend then that will definitely help.",['probability']

First we have to find a most powerful test of size $\alpha$ for testing $H_0:\theta=\theta_0$ against $H'_1:\theta=\theta_1$ Now, $f_\theta (x)=\frac{\theta}{\pi(x^2+\theta^2)}$ , $x\in\mathbb R, \theta>0$ So, $\lambda(x)=\frac{f_{\theta_1}(x)}{f_{\theta_0}(x)}=\frac{\theta_1(x^2+\theta_0^2)}{\theta_0(x^2+\theta_1^2)}$ $\frac{d\lambda(x)}{dx^2}>0$ , so $\lambda(x)$ is an increasing function of $x^2$ or $|x|$ , i.e, $\lambda(x)>k \iff |x|>c$ Therefore, by N-P lemma, a most powerful test of size $\alpha$ for testing $H_0:\theta=\theta_0$ against $H'_1:\theta=\theta_1$ is given by, $\phi(x)= 1$ if $|x|>c$ $\phi(x)= 0$ if $|x|<c$ where c is such that $E_{\theta_0}\phi(x)=\alpha$ , i.e, $P_{\theta_0}(|X|>c)=\alpha$ I'm getting stuck here.

4008337,"How many ""prime"" rectangle tilings are there?","Given two tilings of a rectangle by other rectangles, say that they are equivalent if there is a bijection from the edges, vertices, and faces of the tilings which preserves inclusion. For instance, the following two tilings are equivalent (some corresponding vertices colored): The number of non-equivalent rectangle tilings with $k$ tiles is given at A049021 in the OEIS. Say that a tiling of a rectangle by $k$ other rectangles is prime if the only sub-rectangles in the tiling are individual tiles and the whole set. Here are the unique prime tilings for $k=1,2,5$ up to equivalence: With some casework, one can verify that there are no prime tilings for $k=3,4,6$ . For all $k\ge 7$ , there are at least two prime tilings. One follows the pattern shown below: The other proceeds in a spiral pattern (in fact this construction yields the $k=5$ solution too): It is not hard to check that these two constructions are distinct for all $k$ . How many non-equivalent prime tilings are there with k rectangles? When $k=7$ , I have verified that the above two constructions are the only ones possible, but the casework was extensive and I think approaches for $k$ beyond $9$ or $10$ will require new methods or computer-aided searches to be tractable. This sequence starts $1,1,0,0,1,0,2,\ge2,\ge2,\ldots$ . Even accounting for a possible initial term in the case $k=0$ and the possibility that I have missed a solution for $k=7$ , there are no matches in the OEIS. I have started a draft for a new sequence, but I would like to be able to compute substantially more terms than this (and confirm my existing results) before adding anything. For comparison, A053740 gives the analogous sequence for prime dissections of a triangle into smaller triangles. Some related discussion is at this post on /r/mathriddles. Edit: After a laborious manual classification, I believe there are exactly $6$ prime tilings in the $k=8$ case: (Note that the horizontal symmetry of the example in the center of the second row is merely for visual appeal; the ""heights"" of either the SW or the SE rectangles could be varied without affecting equivalence.) Edit 2021-02-15: These tilings are described in Tiling Rectangles With Rectangles (Chung et al., 1982), where they are called simple tilings. In the article, it is remarked that there are at least $c\cdot 2^{n/7}$ ""essentially different"" simple tilings with $n$ rectangles for some $c>0$ (and presumably only for $n\ge 7$ ?). It is also stated without proof that the number is bounded above by $20000^n$ given ""a rather natural definition of equivalence"". So the sequence grows exponentially, but it seems that the rate at which it does so is not very well pinned down.","['rectangles', 'geometry', 'oeis', 'dissection', 'tiling']"

4008376,Is there a connection between the Whitney embedding theorem and Cayley's theorem?,"Background : I've been working through Guillemin and Pollack's ""Differential Topology."" They take the approach of defining smooth manifolds as ""concrete"" submanifolds of some ambient $\mathbb R^N$ , as opposed to ""abstract"" topological spaces with charts and atlases. In my opinion, this approach leads to better intuition about the subject. Moreover, even in the standard ""abstract"" approach we can establish the Whitney embedding theorem , meaning that we aren't losing generality by working ""concretely."" With this viewpoint of ""abstract"" vs ""concrete"" definitions, I realized that the Whitney embedding theorem with its ambient $\mathbb R^N$ , and Cayley's theorem with its ambient symmetric group $S_N$ , are of the same flavor. I know that there are many other representation theorems in math like these two, and that many can be viewed as generalization of the Yoneda embedding . However, I can't find any sources that include the geometric representation theorems like Whitney and Nash in this Yoneda or categorical framework. So, I'm asking: Question : Can the Yoneda lemma or other category theory be used to unify the Whitney embedding theorem with Cayley's theorem and/or other representation theorems in math? My background consists of the category theory that showed up in the first year grad school, e.g. in an algebraic topology sequence and commutative algebra.

Investigating the $T$ -invariant subspaces by its dimension (the $0$ -dimensional and $4$ -dimensional being the trivial ones), the condition $\chi_T = \chi_{T_W} \cdot \chi_{\tilde T}$ gives us the following possibilities $\chi_{T_W} \in \{ t-2, t\} $ for $W$ 1-dimensional, $\chi_{T_W} \in \{ (t-2)t, (t-2)^2\}$ for $W$ 2-dimensional, $\chi_{T_W} \in \{t(t-2)^2, (t-2)^3\}$ for $W$ 3-dimensional.

That makes a vague bit of sense to me, as the closure of (0) is the entire space, but it contradicts the fact that (0) is a single point in the prime spectrum. Another source said to draw $\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ as a curve passing through the ideals $(2),(3),(5),\ldots$ and a separate point off to the side to represent $(0)$ , but again I don't get how drawing a curve helps clarify the structure of the space. Why not draw it as a discrete set of points and leave out the curve?

4009582,Alternative Definition for the Derivative,"In one class, we said that a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $x_0$ if there exists a map $g : U\subset \mathbb{R} \to L(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ continuous at $x_0$ such that $$
f(x) = f(x_0) + g(x)(x - x_0)
$$ where $U$ is a neighborhood of $x_0$ . This is obviously just a restatement of the usual definition of a derivative with $f'(x_0) = g(x_0)$ , but it has distinct advantages. For example, the proof of the chain rule becomes much clearer. Can we play a similar game in multiple variables? That is, given a function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ , can we say that it is differentiable at $x_0$ if there exists a map $g : U \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to L(\mathbb{R}^n , \mathbb{R}^m)$ continuous at $x_0$ such that $$
f(x) = f(x_0) + g(x)(x - x_0)
$$ I tried to prove the equivalence myself, but it's not as obvious as one the one-variable case (if it's true at all), since in the one variable case we could use the fact that $\mathbb{R}$ is a field and $L(\mathbb{R} , \mathbb{R}) \cong \mathbb{R}$ .","['definition', 'derivatives']"
4009596,Finding Force from acceleration at a point given constant speed,"Prompt: An object of mass $m$ travels along a parabola $y = x^2$ with constant speed $5$ units/sec. What is the force on the object due to acceleration at point $(\sqrt{2}, 2)$ ? Recall $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$ . This was an ""applied theory"" problem I got incorrect on an generated exam I recently took. This question seems to be a similar idea, excepting that I need to work backwards from speed rather than velocity and that speed is constant. Here is what I understand: Since we're working in 2-D, $|\vec{v}(t)| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = 5 \implies |\vec{v}(t)|^2 = 25 = v_x^2 + v_y^2$ . I don't know if this helps me. The parabola can be reparameterized as a trajectory/displacement curve: $\vec{r}(t) = \langle t, t^2 \rangle$ From the reparameterization, we can differentiate $\frac{d \vec{r}}{dt} = \vec{v}(t) = \langle 1, 2t \rangle$ and once more $\frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} = \vec{a}(t) = \langle 0, 2 \rangle$ . If I compute the supposed magnitude of $\vec{v}$ at point $(\sqrt{2}, 2) \Longleftrightarrow t = \sqrt{2}$ , I find $$
|\vec{v}(t=\sqrt{2})| = \sqrt{1^2 + (2\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{1 + 8} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \neq 5
$$ A contradiction of sorts. Point ( $3$ ) above would lead one to naively assume that acceleration is $2$ units/sec $^2$ upwards for all times $t$ . From there, one could conclude $\vec{F} = m \langle 0, 2 \rangle = \langle 0, 2m \rangle$ . Alas the automated grader reports the correct answer is: $$\displaystyle \vec{F} = \langle-\frac{-100\sqrt{2}}{81}m, \frac{50}{81}m\rangle$$ The connection between 3 (or 9) and 81 is not lost on me ( $3^4 = 9^2 = 81$ ), but I don't see how to bridge the gap.

This is just because we know that in nature the phenomenon actually happens, and in deterministic theories there is only one way in which the phenomenon can evolve from initial conditions. Are there examples of (partial) differential equations from physics for which is hard to show existence and uniqueness?
As an example, take n planets that interacts following the gravitational law. The associated differential equation will contain distances between points in the denominator, so it is not clear a priori that solutions will not blow up. However, discarding cases in which planets collide, the solution actually exist, but it is not manifest from regularity of the equations. Another example could be taken from the heat flow equations. In case such an example is found, I would like to know which actual methods are used to prove uniqueness and existence, and if the physical intuition actually plays a role.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations', 'math-history', 'soft-question', 'mathematical-physics']"
4009789,Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure construction on $\mathbb{R}^n$.,"In Athreya's ""Measure Theory and Probability Theory"", it introduces Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure construction on $\mathbb{R}^n$ in general in the following way: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfy the following properties: Let $(x_1,x_2)\leq (y_1,y_2)$ iff $x_1\leq y_1$ and $x_2\leq y_2$ .
If $x\leq y$ in this partial order, then $f(y_1,y_2)-f(x_1,y_2)-f(y_1,x_2)+f(x_1,x_2)\geq 0$ . $f$ is right-continuous for each coordinate. $x\leq y\ (\forall x_n\leq y_n)\implies f(x)\leq f(y)$ (this condition is omitted but I think this might be needed). Then $\mu((x_1,x_2]\times (y_1,y_2])=f(y_1,y_2)-f(x_1,y_2)-f(y_1,x_2)+f(x_1,x_2)$ defines a locally finite Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Conversely, any locally finite Borel measure is generated by such a function. I have some questions about this construction: I want to see a complete proof of this construction in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ; the first condition can be defined analogously in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Even in the book, there was no complete proof of this general construction. I am also not sure whether the third condition can be omitted or not. I wonder if there is a one-to-one correspondence between such functions and locally finite Borel measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ .
In one-dimensional case, a locally finite Borel measure corresponds to a right-continuous increasing function up to a constant. It seems like such a correspondence result, if it exists, should be more constrictive; $f(x,y)=x+y$ yields the zero measure, but any $f(x,y)=F(x)+G(y)$ does so as well. Any reference or complete construction would be much appreciated.","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'borel-measures', 'reference-request']"
4009804,probability of guessing a k-digit number sequentially from n trials,"I recently encountered the following problem.
Assume that we need to guess a $k$ -digit number. We guess it digit by digit and there are $n$ guesses in total. What is the probability of success? Say, $k=5$ , and $n=25$ . We can spend, e.g., 9 trials guessing the first digit, then guess the second digit from the 3rd trial etc. But we cannot make more than 25 guesses in total. I believe we should proceed as follows: guessed from 5 trials: $p=1/10^5$ ; -- we cannot make less than 5 trials when guessing step by step guessed from 6 trials: $p=1/10^4\cdot(1-1/10)\cdot 1/9\cdot 5$ guessed from 7 trials: $p=1/10^3\cdot(1-1/10)^2\cdot 1/9^2\cdot \binom{5}{2}+1/10^4\cdot(1-1/10)\cdot(1-1/9)\cdot 1/8\cdot 5$ , etc. but I'm failing to generalize this scheme. And there is an additional problem that we have to set an upper bound to the number of trials at some point... UPDATE (09.02): As @JMoravitz suggested, one can write an iterative scheme for computing the probability of guessing exactly $\kappa$ digits from $\eta$ trials, $f(\kappa,\eta)$ . I believe that this scheme can be written as $$f(\kappa,\eta)=\frac{1}{10}\sum_{i=1}^{10}f(\kappa−1,\eta−i),$$ where we use the fact that the probability of guessing the digit from $1\le \kappa\le 10$ guesses is always the same: $$p(i=1)=\frac1{10},\quad p(i=2)=\frac{9}{10}\frac{1}{9}=\frac{1}{10},...$$ We also need to add boundary conditions $$\begin{cases}f(\kappa,\eta)=0,&\eta<\kappa\mbox{ (we cannot guess $\kappa$ digits from less than $\eta$ trials)},\\
f(1,\eta)=\frac{1}{10},&0<\eta\le 10\mbox{ (probabilities of guessing the first digit from $\eta$ trials)},\\
f(1,\eta)=0,&\eta=0\mbox{ or }\eta>10.\end{cases}$$ The final probability is to be found as the sum $$p^*=\sum_{i=k}^n f(k,i)=\sum_{i=5}^{25} f(5,i).$$ This scheme looks pretty neat and can be easily computed numerically.

4009960,"Conditional probability, expectation and the Borel-Kolmogorov paradox","I've been studying a course in probability theory, and I'm getting tied up with the formal treatment of conditional probability. Breiman explains quite well that the usual definition, $$ \mathbb{P}(A \;|\; B) := \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)} $$ only makes sense if $\mathbb{P}(B)>0$ , and sometimes we want to condition on sets of measure zero, eg. $\mathbb{P}(A \;|\; X=x)$ over some continuous state space. So far, so good. In order to deal with this problem, we instead use an (in my opinion) long-winded definition that comes from Radon-Nikodym derivatives, and defines the conditional probability in terms of the conditional expectation , and leads to the problem of regular conditional probabilities which may or may not exist and are only almost surely unique. In my opinion it's a total mess, but it's worth it if it means you can get a rigorous treatment. But then I discovered the Borel-Kolmogorov paradox , which shows us that conditioning on a set of measure zero isn't even well-defined , and to the best of my knowledge, Breiman's treatment (which I understand was devised by Kolmogorov and is considered the standard) doesn't help here. So my question is twofold: Does the formal approach actually solve the paradox? I expect the answer here is no, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong. If not, what is the point of the formal treatment if it doesn't actually allow us to do the one thing it's set up to do -- namely, to condition on events with probability zero?","['conditional-probability', 'conditional-expectation', 'stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

For an embedding $h:\mathbb{S}^r\rightarrow\mathbb{S}^n$ with $r<n$ , one has that $$\tilde H_i(\mathbb{S}^n-h(\mathbb{S}^r))\cong\begin{cases}
\mathbb{Z},&\text{ if }i=n-r-1\\

Indeed, the collection of $k$ -subsets of $\{1,\cdots,n\}$ form an $S_n$ -set equivalent to $S_n/(S_k\times S_{n-k})$ , and the collection of $k$ -multisets of $\{1,\cdots,n\}$ is equivalent as an $S_n$ -set to $\bigsqcup S_n/(S_{u_0}\times\cdots\times S_{u_n})$ where the disjoint union is taken over solutions to the system $$ \begin{cases} 0u_0+1u_1+2u_2+\cdots+nu_n=k \\ ~u_0~+~u_1~+~u_2~+\cdots+~u_n=m \end{cases} $$ (Interpret $u_m$ as saying how many elements of $\{1,\cdots,n\}$ have multiplicity $m$ in the multiset.)

I want to check if this is correct since this would then mean that $F/K$ is also isomorphic to a subcartesian product of $H_1,H_2,...,H_n$ ...

When I look at the definitions of measurability and independence they seem pretty distinct from one another, but when heuristically considering sigma algebras as ""information"", it seems like if our random variable is independent of our information (i.e. $X$ independent of $\mathscr{G}$ ), then we don't have enough information to determine the value of our random variable (i.e. $X$ is not $\mathscr{G}$ -measurable).

\|\varphi\| = \sup_{\|f\|_{\infty}=1}|\varphi(f)| = \sup_{\|f\|_{\infty}=1}|\int_0^1f(x)cos(\pi x)dx - f(\frac{1}{2})| = \\
\leq \sup_{\|f\|_{\infty}=1}\int_0^1|f(x)cos(\pi x)|dx + |f(\frac{1}{2})| \\
\leq \sup_{\|f\|_{\infty}=1}\|f\|_{\infty}\int_0^1|cos(\pi x)|dx + \|f\|_{\infty} \leq 1 + 1 = 2
$$ Where last equation is due to cosine function being bounded by 1. Now the norm, letting $f = 2$ (constant): $$
\|\varphi(f)\| = |2\int_0^1cos(\pi x) - 2| = |0 - 2| = 2
$$ so the norm (taking the bound into account) is equal to 2. Lastly, the measure seems to be: $$
\mu(A) = \cos{(\pi x)}d\lambda(A) - \delta_{\frac{1}{2}}(A)

\int_0^1fd\mu = \int_0^1fd\cos{(\pi x)}- \delta_{\frac{1}{2}} = \int_0^1f(x)cos(\pi x)dx - f(\frac{1}{2})
