2279471,Difference between complement and orthogonal complement (vector spaces),"I have been learning some linear algebra and, specifically, solutions to simultaneous equations using matrices and the different cases that arise according to the relative number of unknowns and linearly independent equations that we have. The term 'kernel' came up when this was being taught but wasn't properly explained. On looking into this myself a bit further, I came to the conclusion that the kernel was the complement of the space spanned by the rows of the matrix, in the n dimensional space (there are n unknowns). I tried to look this up to verify if I am using the terms right (I know with complements there are sometimes difficulties with something being 'open' or 'closed'- I think in topological spaces anyway. But I am not too familiar with this and am not sure if it applies to vector spaces anyway. So I just wanted to check if the kernel really could be described as the 'complement' of the subspace spanned by the rows). On looking into this, I keep seeing the terms 'orthogonal complement' pop up, and was wondering if 'orthogonal complement' is strictly the same thing as 'complement'? I get that the vectors in the row space are orthogonal to those in the kernel, but i'm not sure if the terms are the same. Also, I was wondering how one could generate a set of vectors spanning the kernel of some matrix (I am not asking for someone to give this method here- I see it has been asked several times!). In the simple case of 2 linearly independent equations and three unknowns, you can take the cross product of the two linearly independent vectors that are two of your equations. I thought that perhaps this could be extended, and perhaps you could find all the vectors by taking the cross product of all of your linearly independent vectors/equations in different orders, maybe all of the cyclic permutations would do it. For example, say that you have n-k linearly independent equations which give the row vectors $\textbf{r}_1,\textbf{r}_2,...,\textbf{r}_{n-k}$, then you could find a set of vectors spanning the kernel by $(\textbf{r}_{n-k} \times (\textbf{r}_{n-k-1} \times ... (\textbf{r}_2 \times \textbf{r}_1)...))$ And you would cycle these around. However on looking at other posts here I have not seen this being used (instead, curiously, I have seen integrals being used). So I was wondering: would this work to generate a set of vectors spanning the kernel? Why/why not?","['matrices', 'matrix-equations', 'vector-spaces']"
2279532,Characterize joint distribution from marginals,"Let $Z$ be an arbitrary set. Let $X=\prod_{i=1}^n Z_i$ and $Z_i=Z$ for each $i=1,\ldots,n$, $n$ fixed. Consider the $n$-tuple $(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_n)$ with $\mu_i\in\Delta_s(Z)$ for each $i=1,\ldots,n$, i.e., each $\mu_i$ is a simple probability measure on $Z$ (it has finite support). Let $J=\{\mu\in \Delta_s(X): \operatorname*{marg}_{Z_i}\mu=\mu_i \;\;\forall $i$ \}$, i.e. the set of all simple probability measures on $X$ that have $(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_n)$ as marginals. Is there any way to characterize the set $J$? I know that for real valued random variables this problem can be tackled with copulas, but I don't know if copulas can be used in this case.

2279731,Help in understanding what is going on in $A[G]$,"Ok, so Im given a group $G$ and a ring $A$, and define: $$A[G]=\left\{\sum_{g \in G} f(g)  g : f:G \to A, \text{ such that $f$ has finite support}  \right\}$$ Define the sum $(+)$: $$\sum_{g \in G} f(g)  g + \sum_{g \in G} h(g)  g = \sum_{g \in G} (f(g)+h(g))  g$$ And multiplication $(\cdot)$: $$\sum_{\alpha \in G} f(\alpha)  \alpha \cdot \sum_{\beta \in G} h(\beta)  \beta = \sum_{g\in G}\left(\sum_{\alpha \beta = g} f(\alpha)h(\beta)\right)  g$$ And then $(A, +, \cdot)$ is a ring. Now, Im trying to calculate $Z(A[G])$, and Ive got a suggestion that says to first show that if $\sum_{g \in G} f(g)  g \in Z(A[G])$ then $f(g) \in Z(A)$ for every $g\in G$. So I take  $\sum_{g \in G} f(g)  g \in Z(A[G])$ and then for any  $\sum_{g \in G} h(g)  g \in A[G]$, we have that $$\sum_{\alpha \in G} f(\alpha)  \alpha \cdot \sum_{\beta \in G} h(\beta)  \beta =\sum_{\beta \in G} h(\beta)  \beta \cdot \sum_{\alpha \in G} f(\alpha)  \alpha$$ So I thought, ok, given $x\in A$ lets take $h:G \to A$ given by $h(1_{G})=x$ and $h(g)=0$ for every $g \in G-\{1\}$, in order to show that $f(g) \in Z(A)$ for every $g \in G$. So here comes my misunderstanding: For this given $h$, $$\sum_{\alpha \in G} f(\alpha)  \alpha \cdot \sum_{\beta \in G} h(\beta)  \beta = \sum_{\alpha \in G} f(\alpha)  \alpha \cdot (x \cdot 1_{G} + \sum_{g \in G-\{1\}} 0 \cdot g)$$ But $0 \in A$ and $g \in G$ and (I've have not studied Modules until now) and therefore, In principle I don't know how to multiply $0 \cdot g$.

pattern [0 2 1 4] is illegal, because moving your finger between 0 and

2279851,Applied Probability- Bayes theorem,"I need help in all things related to identifying, defining conditions and solution feed back and reasoning most importantly. 1) A blood test indicates the presence of a particular disease 95 % of the time when the diseases is actually present. The same test indicates the presence of the disease .5% of the time when the disease is not present. One percent of the population actually has the disease. Calculate the probability that a person has a disease given that the test indicates the presence of the disease. First and foremost one might think that because the word ""given"" is followed by the indication of the disease they might think that, the indication of the disease is the is the condition However my understanding is that a condition related to a mathematical definition is the state of affairs that must occur or exist before something else can happen. Well clearly one must first either have the disease or not have the disease before a test can indicate whether or not the disease is in fact present. Solution: $C=$ The individual has the disease $.01%$ $E=$ The test indicates that it is present in those with the disease $.95%$ SO we want the proportion of those that have the disease and test positive to the proportion of those that have the disease: $P(E \vert C) = \frac{P(E \cap C)}{P(E \cap C)+P(E^c \cap C)}$ $= \frac{(.01)(.95)}{(.01)(.95)+(.05)(.01)}= \frac{.0095}{.01}=.950$ My answer choices were $.324,.657,.945,.950,.995$ This one made the most sense to me? The other method I used by using the condition as the test didnt even give me anything close to 1%. Was I supposed to do it the other way and was I somehow supposed to take into account that of those that don't have the disease 50% test positive but that wouldnt make sense to me. 2) Ninety-eight percent of all babies survive delivery, However 15 percent of all births involve a c section and when they are done the baby survives 96 percent of the time. If a randomly chosen pregnant woman does not have a c section what is the probability that her baby survives? By the same logic as the previous problem the condition would only make sense to be the method of delivery because if we are talking about a baby surviving delivery then its survival is conditioned on the method of delivery. Correct? $C=$ Does not have a C-section $.85%$ $E=$ her baby survives without a c-section this is difficult to figure out: if 96% of all 15% c section births survive and since we have the percentage of the total 98 percent that survive from both non c and c section then thus 1 minus this should give us the percentage that survive when they do not have a C-section, this makes sense correct? then the probability of a baby surviving a c-section is $.98-.144=.836$ Right? Okay now we set up the question: Using this we want: $P(E \vert C)= \frac{P(EC)}{P(E \cap C)+ P(E^c \cap C)}= \frac{P(E \cap C)}{P(C)}=\frac{(.836)(.85)}{(.836)(.85)+ ?}$ ?= we want the percentage that didn't survive when they had a c-section and didn't have a c-section $(.85)(1-.836?)$ recopying and pasting we get: $P(E \vert C)= \frac{P(EC)}{P(E \cap C)+ P(E^c \cap C)}= \frac{P(E \cap C)}{P(C)}=\frac{(.836)(.85)}{(.836)(.85)+(1-.836)}=\frac{.7106}{(.7106+.164)}$ Some how this was wrong as the supposed answer is slightly above .98.

2279929,Are there an infinite number of primes of the form $\lfloor \pi n \rfloor$?,"Are there an infinite number of primes 
of the form
$\lfloor \pi n \rfloor$? This is sort of
a clickbait title.
I would really like to show that,
for any real irrational

of the form
$\lfloor r n \rfloor$
for positive integer $n$. I can show that
there are an
infinite number of primes
of the form
$\lfloor r n \rfloor$
for
$r < 1+1/g$
for a fixed $g > 1$,
but the best known value
of $g$
is $246$ unconditionally
and
$6$ assuming
an unproved conjecture. To prove this,
I use the idea
of Beatty sequences
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatty_sequence ).
For a real $r > 1$,
let
$B(r)
=\{\lfloor nr \rfloor
\mid n \in \mathbb{N}^+\}$.
($\mathbb{N}^+$
is the set of positive integers.)
Then
Beatty's theorem states that
$B(r)$ and
$B(r/(r-1))$
make up a
disjoint partition
of $\mathbb{N}^+$. If there are
only a finite number of primes
in $B(r)$,
then all the primes
above a certain value
are in
$B(r/(r-1))$. We have
$\lfloor (n+1)r \rfloor
=\lfloor nr+r \rfloor
\ge \lfloor nr \rfloor +\lfloor r \rfloor
$.
Therefore,
if $r > 3$,
$B(r)$
can not contain
any twin primes.
Therefore,
if there are an
infinite number of twin primes,
$B(r/(r-1))$
must contain
an infinite number
of primes
for all 
$r > 3$,
or
$r/(r-1)
\lt 3/2
$. The use of
an unproved conjecture
can be removed
at the cost of
a weaker conclusion
by using the recent results
on prime gaps
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gap ).
It has been shown that
there is a constant $g$
such that
there are an
infinite number of
consecutive primes
that differ by
at most $g$. It has been shown that
$g \le 246$
unconditionally
and that,
assuming the
Elliott‚ÄìHalberstam conjecture
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott%E2%80%93Halberstam_conjecture ),
$g \le 12$
($g \le 6$
assuming a generalized form
of the conjecture.). Arguing as before,
if $r > g+1$,
then
$B(r)$
can not contain
all the primes
above any finite value.
For,
if it did,
there are an
infinite numer of
consecutive primes
$p$ and $q$
such that
$q-p \le g$,
and $p$ and $q$
can not both be in
$B(r)$. Therefore
$B(r/(r-1))$
must contain an
infinite number of primes
for $r > g+1$.
Restating,
$B(r)$
must contain an
infinite number of primes
for $r < (g+1)/g
=1+1/g$. I don't know how to go
beyond this.","['prime-numbers', 'sequences-and-series']"

2280319,How does the gradient/jacobian relate to the first derivative of one dimensional functions?,"My question is about this answer by Simon S ( Is the gradient vector of a function the derivative of the function ) The derivative of a function $f : U \subset \mathbb{R}^m \to
\mathbb{R}$ at a point $p \in U$ is a linear map $Df_p : \mathbb{R}^m
\to \mathbb{R}$. We can identify the gradient of $f$ with $D_p$, if
  everything exists, by $$Df_p(v) = \langle \nabla f(p), v\rangle$$ Equivalently, $Df_p$ is a co-tangent vector, i.e., a member of the set
  of linear maps acting on $T_p$, the vector space of tangent vectors at
  $p$: i.e., $Df_p = \langle \nabla f(p), \cdot \rangle : T_p \to
\mathbb{R}$. This formalism is helpful when we want to generalize from
  $\mathbb{R}^n$ to manifolds. In an abstract sense, I think I understand the differential being a linear map. But in $\mathbb{R}$ we just have one derivative $f'(x)$ where we plug in a value for x and get a scalar that tells us the derivative at that point. But in higher dimensions, we establish a gradient or a Jacobian at a point  and then we use the dot product to calculate the derivative as stated above. Of what importance is it at which point we create the gradient and of what importance which vector we multiply with the gradient? Is $\nabla f(3,3)$ the derivative of the function $f:\mathbb{R^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$? Or is it $\langle\nabla f(x,y),(3,3)\rangle$ Or is it  $\langle\nabla f(3,3),(3,3)\rangle$ ? How can one understand this as just the higher dimensional derivative comparable to a single dimensional $f'(3)$? Why do we need that dot product with an additional vector? Where is the connection between the derivative being a linear map and the derivative just being the sum of the partial derivatives? EDIT: If it isn't clear, what I'm implying consider sites like these http://www.solitaryroad.com/c353.html or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_derivative which essentially state The total differential is the sum of the partial differentials.

2280552,"Graph polar equation $r = 6 cos(\theta)$, issues with plotting on xy-plane","I will be grateful for your help and explanation on how to decipher what authors of the Precalculus book did when plotting the equation from $r,\theta$ -plane into xy-plane. Below I quote 3 parts of their explanations, and attach screen shots of graphs Example on how to graph the polar equation
$$r = 6 cos(Œ∏)$$ Quote part 1: We graph one cycle of $r = 6 cos(Œ∏)$ on the polar plane and use it to help graph the equation on the xy-plane. We see that as $Œ∏$ ranges from $0$ to $œÄ/2$ , $r$ ranges from $6$ to $0$. In the xy-plane, this means that the curve starts 6 units from the origin on the positive x-axis (Œ∏ = 0) and gradually returns to the origin by the time the curve reaches the y-axis (Œ∏ = œÄ/2 ). The arrows drawn in the figure below are meant to help you visualize this process. In the Œ∏r-plane, the arrows are drawn from the Œ∏-axis to the curve r = 6 cos(). In the xy-plane, each of these arrows starts at the origin and is rotated through the corresponding angle , in accordance with how we plot polar coordinates.
End of the quote part 1. Picture attached. Quote part 2: Next, we repeat the process as Œ∏ ranges from œÄ/2 to œÄ. Here, the r values are all negative. This means that in the xy-plane, instead of graphing in Quadrant II, we graph in Quadrant IV, with all of the angle rotations starting from the negative x-axis.
End of the quote part 2. So, if Œ∏ = 3œÄ/4, then r = -3‚àö2
Œ∏ = œÄ , then r = -6 In the first part we started at the angle Œ∏ = 0 and thus r = 6, which we plotted as x = 6; then rotating counter-clockwise as all values of r become smaller as Œ∏ approaches œÄ/2. This is clear to me. And now I am confused by the second part. It is said that r values are negative, so I don't understand why we plot these values along the positive x-axis and rotate clockwise. How did they come up with this rotation, what is the reason that I fail to understand? The phrase on the picture saying ""r < 0 so we plot here"" gives a sense that this is obvious, but not to me. Please, help me to understand it. It seems they are plotting absolute values of r along x-axis, so all x values are positive. But how's this justified mathematically? Here is also the next, even more confusing, quote:
As Œ∏ ranges from œÄ to 3œÄ/2, the r values are still negative, which means the graph is traced out in Quadrant I instead of Quadrant III.
End of quote. Interesting. The second part stated that as values of r are negative, we have to plot in QIV; and the third quote says that as values are still negative, we obviously have to plot in QI. I am utterly confused. :) Please, help. Summarizing a bit: (1) when the interval is [0, œÄ/2] and r = 6, they start at y = x = 6 and go all the way ""up"" (counter-clockwise) till angle reaches œÄ/2; it's clear;
(2) when the interval is [œÄ/2 , œÄ] and the value of r = -6 at angle œÄ, they most likely start at the angle -œÄ/2, move counter-clockwise ""up"" till 2œÄ, and surprisingly end at y = x = 6, not x = -6;
(3) and then, when even more puzzling thing happens - even though values are still negative and interval is [œÄ, 3œÄ/2], they get back to the interval [0, œÄ/2] in QI;
(4) and for the last interval of [3œÄ/2, 2œÄ], they get back to QIV.

I had a loose proof ready to go, but I noticed a fatal flaw. Perhaps there is a way to work around this though. My tactic was to start from $a^2 - ab - b^2 < 0$ and complete the square on the LHS for $a$. I ended up with
$$
\left(a-\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{5b^2}{4} < 0 \iff \left(a - \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 < \left( \frac{\sqrt{5} \, b}{2} \right)^2.
$$ Now the tempting thing to do is to show this is equivalent to saying
$$
\quad \quad \qquad \quad \, \, \iff a-\frac{b}{2} < \frac{\sqrt{5} \, b}{2}
$$ but obviously it is necessary for $a > b / 2$ for this to work.

2280604,Axiom of Dependent Choice and the von Neumann Universe,"Reading Roitman's revised edition of her 'Introduction to Modern Set Theory', I got  a bit confused about her proof of the claim that under regularity $V$, the universe of sets is equal to $\bigcup_{\alpha \in ON} V_\alpha$, the von Neumann universe, especially about the role of choice principles in that proof. Here's her proof. Let a set $x$ be big, if $x \not \in \bigcup_{\alpha \in ON} V_\alpha$. Every big $x$ has some big element. Otherwise we would have $x \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in ON} V_\alpha$, which is impossible. So, if there's some big $x$, $x$ is the beginning of some infinite descending $\in$-chain, contradicting regularity. Here's my question: Doesn't inferring the existence of some infinite descending $\in$-chain require the axiom of Dependent Choice (DC)? For under DC from every big $x$ containg some big $y$ we can conclude that there's some countably infinite sequence of big sets $f$ with $f(0) = x$ and $f(n +1) \in f(n)$. Is there a way of avoiding choice principles in Roitman's proof?","['logic', 'elementary-set-theory']"

It is readily seen that $\det(\mathbf M)=\alpha\det(\mathbf A)$ , where $\alpha=\mathbf d-\bf b^\top A^{-1}b$ Now, $\alpha>0\Rightarrow \det(\mathbf M)>0$ $\quad(\det(\mathbf A)>0$ by hypothesis $)$ This is not enough for $\bf M$ to be p.d. as I need all its leading principal minors to be positive as well. But the answers tell me that $\alpha>0$ ensures all of that. $\alpha=0\Rightarrow \bf M$ is singular As it turns out, this condition ensures that $\bf M$ is p.s.d, but as far as I know this is not the case in general. $\alpha<0\Rightarrow \det(\mathbf M)<0$ This condition is apparently sufficient in this case for $\bf M$ to be indefinite. But if $\bf M$ is indefinite, it may be a singular matrix as well (i.e., $\alpha$ might as well have vanished in this case). Moreover, as I note in the above two cases, this isn't a sufficient condition either for a matrix to be indefinite. I would like to clarify my doubts and a possible proof sketch would be helpful too. EDIT. Extending the problem from a bordered matrix to a partitioned matrix: Suppose $\mathbf M=\left[\begin{matrix}\bf A & \bf B\\\bf B^\top & \bf D \\\end{matrix}\right]$ is symmetric and $\bf A$ is square. Then show that $\bf M$ is p.d. iff $\bf A$ and $\mathbf D-\bf B^\top A^{-1}B$ are p.d. What should be the correct approach now? I can calculate the determinant like before but the same problem still bothers me. Thinking in terms of quadratic forms and using the definitions of definiteness do not seem to be the way to go about it.","['matrices', 'positive-definite', 'positive-semidefinite', 'quadratic-forms', 'linear-algebra']"

Arguing by contradiction, suppose $U\neq L^2(G)$. Then $U^\perp\neq 0$.

\begin{align*}
        \overline{h(x^{-1})}&=\overline{\langle R(x^{-1})u,v\rangle}=\langle v,R(x^{-1})u\rangle=\langle R(x)v,u\rangle \\

So let $h\in U^\perp \setminus \{0\}.$ Suppose $h'\notin U^\perp$. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a basis  for $U$ consisting of some matrix coefficients in $U$. Then we may write $$h'=g+\sum_{i=1}^n a_if_i$$ for some $f_1,...,f_n\in \mathcal{M}$ and $g\in U^\perp$ and for some scalars $a_1,...,a_n$. Note that at least one of these scalars is nonzero.

h'(x)=h(y^{-1}x)=g(x)+\sum_{i=1}^n a_i f_i(x)\qquad (*)

$$f_i(x)=\langle R_i(y^{-1}x)u_i,R_i(y^{-1})v_i\rangle$$ 
So for any $t\in G$, the equation ($*$) becomes

(b) Most likely there isn't any such a pair $(F, G)$ , but I do not have the means to use these methods on my own. Short description of section 1 of Alf van der Poorten's paper The defining series for $\zeta(3):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}1/n^3$ and $\zeta(2):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}1/n^2$ are accelerated resulting in \begin{equation*}
\zeta (2)=3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty }
\frac{1}{n^{2}\binom{2n}{n}},\tag{2}
\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
\zeta (3)=\frac{5}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty }
\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^{3}\binom{2n}{n}}\tag{3}.
\end{equation*} For instance, $(3)$ follows from the identity \begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n^{3}}-2\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\left( -1\right) ^{n-1}}{n^{3}\binom{2n}{n}}=\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k^{3}\binom{N+k}{k}\binom{N}{k}}-\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k^{3}\binom{2k}{k}}\tag{4},
\end{equation*} by letting $N\rightarrow \infty $ and noticing that \begin{equation*}
\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k^{3}\binom{N+k}{k}\binom{N}{k}}=0.
\end{equation*} Equality $(4)$ can be explained as follows: Write \begin{equation*}
X_{n,k}=\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^{2}\binom{n+k}{k}\binom{n-1}{k}},\qquad D_{n,k}=\frac{(-1)^{k}}{n^{2}\binom{n+k}{k}\binom{n-1}{k}}\qquad k<n.
\end{equation*} Notice that $$X_{n,k}=D_{n,k-1}-D_{n,k}.\tag{5}$$ Hence \begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{X_{n,k}}{n} &=&\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left( \frac{D_{n,k-1}}{
n}-\frac{D_{n,k}}{n}\right) =\frac{D_{n,0}}{n}-\frac{D_{n,n-1}}{n} \\
&=&\frac{1}{n^{3}}-2\frac{\left( -1\right) ^{n-1}}{n^{3}\binom{2n}{n}},\qquad\frac{D_{n,0}}{n} =\frac{1}{n^{3}},\quad \frac{D_{n,n-1}}{n}=2\frac{

k\leq n-1$ \begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}X_{n,k}=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left( D_{n,k-1}-D_{n,k}\right)
=D_{n,0}-D_{n,n-1}.
\end{equation*} Now, summing over $n$ , $1\leq n\leq N$ , and noticing that \begin{equation*}
\frac{X_{n,k}}{n}=E_{n,k}-E_{n-1,k},\qquad E_{n,k}=\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k^{3}\binom{n+k}{k}\binom{n}{k}},\tag{6}
\end{equation*} we obtain \begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\sum_{n=k+1}^{N}\frac{X_{n,k}}{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}
\sum_{n=k+1}^{N}\left( E_{n,k}-E_{n-1,k}\right) =\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left(
E_{N,k}-E_{k,k}\right). 
\end{equation*} So, on the one hand \begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{X_{n,k}}{n} &=&\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{
n^{3}}-2\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\left( -1\right) ^{n-1}}{n^{3}\binom{2n}{n}},\tag{7}
\end{eqnarray*} and on the other hand \begin{eqnarray*}

Remarks The combination of equations $(5)$ and $(6)$ forms an identity of the form $(\ast)$ , which is equation $(6.1.2)$ of [3, chapter 6] (Zeilberger's Algorithm). As for $(2)$ , [2, section 1] actually explains how to accelerate $\eta(2):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty }(-1)^{n-1}/n^{2}$ and obtain $(2)$ , using the
relation $\eta(s) = \left(1-2^{1-s}\right) \zeta(s)$ . As such, if feasible, I expect that accelerating $\eta(4)$ might be easier than $\zeta(4)$ .

Let $f$ be a holomorphic function, and suppose that $Y$ is locally cut out by irreducible $g\in \mathcal{O}_x$ around $x$, then the order of $f$ at $x \in Y$ is defined to be the integer $a=ord_x f$ such that $f=g^a h$ in the factorization of $\mathcal{O}_x$ (since $\mathcal{O}_x$ is a UFD). It is claimed, in many complex geometry books like Huybrechts and Griffiths, that $ord_x f$ is locally constant, yet I don't see why this is true. I suppose a proof would be along the lines of: $Y$ at a point $y$ near $x$ is also locally cut out by $g\in \mathcal{O}_y$, and $h$ remains to be relatively prime to $g$ if $y$ is close enough, so we still have $f=g^{ord_x f} h$ in $\mathcal{O}_y$. But my problem with the above proof is that $g$ may not be a locally defining function of $Y$ at $y$, in particular $g$ could be reducible in $\mathcal{O}_y$, since there are examples of irreducible holomorphic function germs becoming reducible in a neighborhood (see: Irreducibility of holomorphic functions in a neighborhood of a point ). In this case we can only conclude $ord_y f \geq ord_x f$, i.e. the order is locally non-decreasing. An explanation of how to reason that the order is locally constant would be great.

2281164,Uniformly Convergent Subsequence,"This is almost surely an Arzela-Ascoli question, since it comes from an old exam of which such problems are quite common. Unfortunately, I can't seem to get it though. $\{ f_n \}$ is a sequence of functions $[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $|f_n'(x)| \leq \frac{1 + |\ln (x)|}{\sqrt{x}}$ and $-10 \leq \int_0^1 f_n(x) dx \leq 10$ for every $n$. The question is to show the existence of a uniformly convergent subsequence. In these kinds of situations, the bounds given usually turn into something nice  to force uniform boundedness. Maybe I could hope to establish equicontinuity using the integral somehow, but I'm not told that the $f_n$ are always positive, so the absolute values would probably screw things up anyway. Is it an easy problem I'm missing or is this totally the wrong track? If so, what's the right track?",['real-analysis']

2281257,"Differentials on curve, Fulton Ex. 8.23","Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve, $P\in X$, $f\in k(X)$. I am currently trying to show that if $f\in\mathcal{O}_{P}$ then $\frac{df}{dt}\in\mathcal{O}_{P}$ using the method of Ex. 8.23 in Fulton's Algebraic Curves. So far I have considered the map $\varphi:\mathcal{O}_{P}\rightarrow k[[T]],\ t\mapsto T$ where $t$ is a uniformising parameter at $P$, so far I have shown that if we consider the power series expansion of $f=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}a_{i}t^{i}$ then applying the usual derivation gives $df=(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}ia_{i}t^{i-1})dt$, hence the image of $\frac{df}{dt}$ in $k[[T]]$ is $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}ia_{i}T^{i-1}$, which is the formal derivative of $\varphi(f)$.

  where $F(x), f(x)$ are continuous functions from $\mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+$. Here is my approach. Intuitively, $x+f(x)\leq d, x\geq 0$ is equivalent to $x \in [a_1, b_1] \cup [a_2, b_2]\cup \cdots \cup [a_{n}, b_{n}]$,
where $a_i\leq b_i$, $a_1$ is either 0 or solution of $x+f(x) = d$, $b_n$ is either d or solution of $x+f(x) = d$, and $a_i, b_i$ are solutions of $x+f(x) = d$ for other cases. Hence, the optimization problem becomes

2281272,Subbasis for Cartesian Product Topology,"Let $\aleph(\mathcal{A})$ be arbitrary (i.e., let $\mathcal{A}$ be an indexing set of arbitrary cardinality). Then, in the space $\prod \{Y_{\alpha}|\alpha \in \mathcal{A}\}$, for each $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}$, let $\displaystyle \Sigma_{\alpha}$ be a subbasis for the topology $\mathcal{T}_{\alpha}$ of $Y_{\alpha}$. I need to prove that the family $\{ \langle V_{\beta}\rangle \,|\,\text{all}\,v_{\beta}\in \Sigma_{\beta}; \, \text{all}\, \beta \in \mathcal{A} \}$ is also a subbasis for the cartesian product topology in $\displaystyle \prod_{\alpha}Y_{\alpha}$ Please note that this is NOT homework! I have my final exam on Wednesday and I am trying to read through Chapter IV of Dugundji's Topology to help me prepare, but I still am having a lot of trouble even understanding how this cartesian product topology works. This problem appears in the text as part of a given theorem, and then for the proof, it says ""This is immediate from I, 9.5 , and is left for the reader"". I. 9.5 states that ""Let $\{Y_{\alpha}|\alpha \in \mathcal{A}\}$ be a family of nonempty sets; for each $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}$, let $A_{\alpha}, B_{\alpha}$ be subsets of $Y_{\alpha}$. Then, $$(1) \, \displaystyle \prod_{\alpha}A_{\alpha} \cap \prod_{\alpha}B_{\alpha} $$
  $$(2) \displaystyle \prod_{\alpha}A_{\alpha} \cup \prod_{\alpha}B_{\alpha} \subset \prod_{\alpha}\left(A_{\alpha} \cup B_{\alpha} \right)"" $$ I don't really see how this result is ""immediate"" from this - and even if it were, why would it be left to the reader? If something is left to the reader that implies that it requires a little bit of work and mechanics and manipulation, right? On that front, I believe the way to show that this family $\{\langle V_{\beta} \rangle\}$ is a subbasis for the product topology, call it $\mathcal{T}_{p}$ is to show that the topology generated by $\{\langle V_{\beta} \rangle \}$, call it just $\mathcal{T}$ is the same topology as $\mathcal{T}_{p}$. However, I am not sure how to go about doing this. Especially since we need to be a little bit careful, because isn't it true that a set of the form $\displaystyle \prod U_{\alpha}$ where each $U_{\alpha}$ is a proper open subset of $Y_{\alpha}$ is never an open set in the cartesian product $\displaystyle \prod Y_{\alpha}$? (This is what I meant when I said I was having trouble understanding how the cartesian topology works.) Anyway, to start, I'd say, suppose $\langle V_{\beta} \rangle = p_{\beta}^{-1}(V_{\beta})$ is a subbasis for $\mathcal{T}$. Then, taking finite intersections of these $p_{\beta}^{-1}(V_{\beta})$, we obtain basic elements for the topology $\mathcal{T}$. Now, from a different result related to I. 9.5 , we have that $\displaystyle \cap_{\beta} \langle V_{\beta} \rangle = \prod_{\beta} V_{\beta}$, and so our basic elements look like $\displaystyle \cup_{\beta}\prod_{\beta}V_{\beta}$. Then, by I. 9.5 , we have that $\displaystyle \cup_{\beta}\prod_{\beta}V_{\beta} \subset \prod_{\beta}\left( \cup_{\beta}V_{\beta} \right)$. But then, how do I get that this gives me the open sets in $\mathcal{T}_{p}$? Then, going in the other direction is also a problem for me. How do I show that $\mathcal{T}_{p} \subset \mathcal{T}$ here? There is a question already posted on here where the OP asked for a proof of this result using the approach of proving that the product topology is the smallest topology containing $\{ V_{\beta} \}$, but I'm not sure I really understand the language the answer uses regarding maximal elements, or even why proving that it is the smallest such topology is helpful (for reference, the question/answer is here ). What I would like is for someone to provide me with a worked out detailed proof building on what I've already said here (supposing it's right, of course) explaining all the why's. Like I said, this is not homework - I was just trying to work through it on my own to prepare for my exam, and I got stuck. I have a tendency of doing that - getting to a point and then getting stuck for hours in a quagmire of details and losing loads of valuable study time because of it.

$$
\left|\frac{st\sqrt{t}}{s^2+t^2}\right|=\left|\frac{\sqrt{s^2}\sqrt{t}\sqrt{t^2}}{s^2+t^2}\right|\le \left|\frac{\sqrt{t}(s^2+t^2)}{s^2+t^2}\right|=\sqrt{t}.

Now, since $\delta^2>s^2+t^2$, $\sqrt{t}<\sqrt[4]{\delta^2+s^2}\le\sqrt[4]{\delta^2+s^2+t^2}<\sqrt[4]{2\delta^2}=\varepsilon$. Hence, $f$ is continuous at $(0,0)$. Do you think this is correct?

2281290,Understanding the logic behind finding the Parent Function given an Exact Differential,"I know the procedure to find the parent function but I do not understand the logic behind this procedure. Lets suppose we are greeted with an exact differential :
$$du=y\,dx+(x+2y)dy\tag{a}$$ and we wish to find the parent function $u=u(x,y)$. For the case of a general differential $df$ $$df(x,y)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy\tag{b}$$ Using the form of $(\mathrm{b})$ in the specific case of $(a)$ we have $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=y\tag{1}$$
and
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=x+2y\tag{2}$$ Starting with equation $(1)$; I attempt via integration wrt $x$ to find the parent function $u$: $$u(x,y)=\fbox{$\color{red}{\int\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}dx=xy+g(y)}$}$$ Where $g(y)$ is an unknown function of $y$. Now it is at this point that I am already confused for $2$ reasons: 1. The LHS of the boxed equation is $$\int\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\color{blue}{dx}$$ But, shouldn't this really be $$\int\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\color{blue}{\partial x}$$ since we are integrating a partial derivative? Therefore, Is this really the ' partial integral '? I write this as I see no justification in integrating a partial derivative when the integration differential is not partial. 2. The RHS has $g(y)$ as an unknown function of $y$. But why is this? Why not have an unknown function of $x$; $h(x)$ or an unknown function of $x$ & $y$; $q(x,y)$? Or lastly; since I know that only one of these $3$ possibilities can be correct why not write the RHS as $xy+g(y)+\text{constant}$ Proceeding anyway to equation $(2)$ and following the same recipe as before
I find that 
$$u(x,y)=\fbox{$\color{#180}{\int\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}dy=xy+y^2+r(x)}$}$$
Where $r(x)$ is an unknown function of $x$. Iff $u(x,y)$ is equal to both $\color{red}{xy+g(y)}$ and $\color{#180}{xy + y^2 + r(x)}$ we must match them up I guess and conclude that $g(y)=y^2$ and $r(x)=0$. Is this logic correct? If so we can write the parent function as $$u(x,y)=xy + y^2$$ The problem is that the correct answer is $$\color{#F80}{u(x,y)=xy + y^2+C}$$ where $C$ is a constant. But where on earth did the constant $C$ come from? I just matched up the two equations for $u(x,y)$ and found that there is no extra constant $C$. I know this is an awful lot of questions for one post, but if anyone is able to answer some or any of them it will be greatly appreciated.

It seems that that number is not random, so how could he have come up with it? My attempt: I was trying to prove theorem 1.21 from Rudin's real analysis book on my own without looking at Rudin's proof. The way I attempted to prove it was to try to prove what seemed true from my already collected intuition on the real numbers before I started to study real analysis. So I drew lots of picture which lead me to think of defining $E = \{ \bar y \in R_{>0} : \bar y < x^{1/n} \}$: Thus, I knew that $E = \{ \bar{y} \in R_{>0} : \bar y^n < x \}$ is just the same as $E = \{ \bar y \in R_{>0} : \bar y < x^{1/n} \}$. So it was obvious that what I had to show was that the $\alpha = supE = y = x^{1/n}$ (also the reason for defining sets like that is cuz we probably need to use the Least Upper Bound (LUB) property cuz its one of the few things we are suppose to know about analysis so far). Thus, I proceed to show $E$ is bounded and non-empty so that I was guaranteed that the sup existed since we assumed the Least Upper Bound (LUB) property (a.k.a. the completeness axiom). Then I thought I want $y = \alpha$ so one option was to try showing $y < \alpha$ AND $y > \alpha$ are false, so by trichotomy $y=\alpha$. Since I didn't have direct access to $y$ I decided to take the same strategy except with $y^n = x$ instead of $y$ and $\alpha^n$ instead of $\alpha$. Intuitively I thought well lets assume $\alpha^n < x$ and $ x < \alpha^n $. The first one is too small so hopefully it should lead to some contradiction and perhaps show $\alpha < y$ is false. Similarly the other one $ x < \alpha^n $ should be too large somehow. Then maybe we can use trichotomy to get $\alpha^n = x$ which completes the proof. I attempted the first one $\alpha^n < x$. The only other thing I knew about $\alpha$ was that $\forall \bar y \in E, \bar y^n < x$. Then I decided to combine both equation (since I was hinted to use $a^n - b^n$ cuz I saw that identity in the soln when I check for my solution that E was bounded and non-empty): $$ \alpha^n - \bar y^n < x - \bar y ^n < 0$$ then because of the hint (that I probably wouldn't had realized I needed to use) I was extremely lucky and decided to subtract $\bar y^n$ from both sides (notice that if I would have decided to subtract by $\alpha^n$ it wouldn't have worked): $$  \alpha^n - \bar y^n = (\alpha - \bar y)\left(\sum_{0\leq i+j \leq n-1} \bar y^i \alpha^j \right) = (\alpha - \bar y)K < 0$$ where I noticed that $K > 0$ since every element of E is greater than zero and so is its least upper bound $\alpha$. Thus $K > 0$ and getting rid of it gets me: $$ (\alpha - \bar y) < 0 \implies \alpha < \bar y$$ which is obviously false since that would imply that $ \alpha$ is not an upper bound. Thus $\alpha^n < x$ is false. Now assume $x < \alpha^n $. One can't use the same argument as in my previous attempt because this time we are trying to create an element that is an upper bound smaller than $\alpha$ and its not clear how elements form $E$ are useful. Its clear to me we have to choose an $h$ such that: $$ x < (\alpha - h)^n < \alpha^n$$ I have given it a proper attempt (see at the end of my question) but I am unable to prove the desired result no matter how much I play with the algebra and the known facts I have. Thus, my question is how did Rudin come up with the following: $$k = \frac{y^n-x}{n y^{n-1}}$$ from his explanation it seems it just came out of a hat. I am sure if I plugged it in I would see that ""it works"" however, I wanted to know/see how to come up with it myself. Similarly I don't see how/why he came up with this one: $$h < \frac{x - y^n}{n(y+1)^{n-1}}$$ it seems that its not even required considering my first proof/argument, but I assume it must use the same idea considering it seems it used the same identity $b^n - a^n = (b-a)(b^{n-1}+b^{n-2}a+ \cdots + b a^{n-2} + a^{n-1})$. Anyone care to share what is the trick I missed? Is there some way to understand how one would have come up with using that? Is there some conceptual idea for the proof that he did not make explicit that I missed? I am hoping to get a more satisfying proof than just feeling I played around with symbols until I forced the paper to tell me the truth. It seems I missed some insights because even with the hints (like using the identity) didn't yield me a solution. What I tried: If we have: $$ x < \alpha^n$$ then at least intuitively, that must imply that there must be some element $y_{BAD}$ smaller than our supremum $\alpha$ that is still an upper bound (this intuition is because we are going under the assumption that $\alpha^n = x \iff \alpha = x^{1/n}$). Therefore it seems reasonable to try to decrease $\alpha$ the right amount $h$ such that: $$ x < (\alpha - h)^n < \alpha^n $$ then since $h$ is some distance that we go down from $\alpha$ we probably don't need to go down further than $\alpha$ so it seems reasonable to require $0 < h < \alpha$. With that we have using algebra: $$ x < (\alpha - h)^n = (\alpha - h)\left( \alpha^{n-1}+\alpha^{n-2}h + \dots + \alpha h^{n-2} + h^{n-1} \right) = (\alpha - h) K < \alpha^n $$ the reason we did that factorization is so that we can hopefully get some inequality for $h$ (intuitively, think that we are trying to make $h$ the subject so that we can choose the right one to get the contradiction we need). Therefore lets try to remove all the nasty exponents with $h$ by assuming $ h < \alpha$ (otherwise $\alpha$ decreases by too much): $$ K = \alpha^{n-1}+\alpha^{n-2}h + \dots + \alpha h^{n-2} + h^{n-1} < n \alpha^{n-1}$$ so lets plug it into: $$ x < (\alpha - h) K < \alpha^n $$ after plugging the inequality and leaving $h$ alone and some algebra I skipped I got: $$ \alpha - \frac{ \alpha^n }{K} < h < \alpha - \frac{x}{n \alpha^{n-1}}$$ unfortunately I don't I didn't manage to plug in $K < n \alpha^{n-1}$ successfully to both sides so I got stuck with the above (which is still in terms of $h^j, j>1$) which still unfortunately has high order terms for $h$...so close it feels... (note I've also tried more things but it would be ridiculous to put it all in here). so I feel got some of the main insights: Require the constraint $x < (\alpha - y)^n < \alpha^n$ using $x<\alpha^n$ and $h>0$. use $(\alpha - h)^n = (\alpha - h)\left( \alpha^{n-1}+\alpha^{n-2}h + \dots + \alpha h^{n-2} + h^{n-1} < n \alpha^{n-1} \right)$ to get $h$ alone. Use the upper bound on $K < n \alpha^{n-1}$ to remove the higher order terms of $h$ that are annoying (since we are assuming we don't know how to take roots). i.e. (\alpha - h)K < (\alpha - h)n \alpha^{n-1} those seem the main ingredients but when I tried putting them together it seemed I was still missing something because playing with the algebra didn't lead to the answer.

In my professor's answer he changes the Y to X and add/sub a .5 depending on which ""tail"" we are trying to find. Ex. P(Y<98) -> P(X<98.5)
      P(Y>115) -> P(X > 114.5) What exactly is happening here?","['normal-distribution', 'statistics', 'central-limit-theorem', 'probability', 'approximation']"
2281492,Interesting convergence in divisor sums up to $10^k$,"Let $S(k)$ be the sum of divisors across each of $1, 2, ..., 10^k$. For example, $$\begin{align}S(1) &= 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 12 + 8 + 15 + 3 + 17 \\&= 87\end{align}$$ where each of $1 + 3 + ... + 17$ are the sums of divisors of $1, 2, ..., 10^1$ respectively. I noticed that as $k$ increases, the decimal expansion of $S(k)$ seems to ""converge"" to some number. For the first few values of $k$, computed using some suitable script, we have $$\begin{align}
S(1) &=87\\
S(2) &=8299\\
S(3) &= 823081\\

S(17) &= 8224670334241132270081671519064067\\
\end{align}$$ If we take the decimal expansion of $S(k)$ as a fractional part and let this be $S'(k)$, we have $$S'(\infty) = 0.82246703342411...$$ But hey! $$\frac{\pi^2}{12} = 0.82246703342411...$$ So my question is this : Is the limit indeed $$S'(\infty) = \frac{\pi^2}{12}$$?","['number-theory', 'divisor-sum']"

On the left-hand side, for fixed $r$, the first integral is from $x=r$ to $x=\sqrt{r}$ and amounts to $\frac{1}{2}(r-r^2)$. The second integral is from $x=\sqrt{r}$ to $x=1$ and amounts to $\frac{1}{3}(1-r\sqrt{r})$. Suppose $g(x)=x^t$ and $f(x)=x^s$ for $s\geq t\geq 1$. Then the right-hand side is $\frac{1}{t+1}$. The left-hand side is

Proof: We show that any two positive integers are equal, from which the result follows. We do this by induction
on the maximum of the two numbers. Let $P(n)$ be the statement ‚Äúif $r$ and $s$ are positive integers and $\max \{ r, s \} =

$\max \{ r ‚àí 1, s ‚àí 1 \} = n$. By the inductive hypothesis, $r ‚àí 1 = s ‚àí 1$ and hence $r = s$. Thus $P(n + 1)$ is true. The result is now proved by mathematical induction.","['fake-proofs', 'induction', 'integers', 'logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

2281877,Cutting an arbitrary object into equal sized pieces,"Not homework, this problem occurred to me while chopping vegetables. Consider an arbitrary object in $\mathbb{R}^n$, is it possible to cut it into $2^n$ pieces of equal volume using $n$ orthogonal slices?  Suppose that the volume of the original object is $2^n$ so I want want each piece to have volume $1$, If the object has sufficient symmetry, e.g. a sphere or a cube, then it is easy.  I would like to consider arbitrary objects, my tomatoes are not sufficiently symmetric. Various reasonable conditions may be assumed.  Measurabuility is an obvious requirement.  Boundedness if necessary but if it would be nice if it wasn't.  Similarly, connectedness if necessary but again it would be nice if it wasn't; obviously the answer might not be unique for non-connected objects but that is acceptable. For $n = 1$, the problem is easy. For $n = 2$, possible but a little more care is needed.  First, we can slice it along a line with constant $x$ into two equal pieces.  Now do the same with a line with constant $y$.  We have 4 pieces but they are not necessarily all equal.  Diagonally opposite pieces must be equal but adjacent ones need not be.  However, I can now rotate my cuts and solve that. For $n = 3$, it gets harder.  I can start similarly with planes of constant $x$, $y$, and $z$ followed by rotations but I don't seem to have sufficient degrees of freedom to balance all 8 pieces. I have not attempted $n > 3$ yet, let's walk before I can run.  Anyway, I don't have any $4d$ tomatoes.",['measure-theory']

2281940,Splitting infinite sets into disjoint sets of equal cardinality,"When given an infinite set $X$, it seems to me very reasonable that one can 'split' it up into two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ such that all three have the same cardinality. For countable sets, this is rather easy, for then we can index the elements in $X$ by $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, and we can take $A$ as the elements indexed by even $n$, and $B$ those by odd ones. Of course, countability isn't needed per se; with a set indexed by $\mathbb{R}$, it can be split up rather easily as well. Where I run into difficulty is a general infinite set, where this indexing trick doesn't seem to work, because the indexing set isn't 'known' well enough (in the sense that I can't make an easy choice, as with $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{R}$). My question is if this is possible for any infinite set $X$.",['elementary-set-theory']
