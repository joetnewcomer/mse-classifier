1687320,The algebraic dual space of a TVS is complete,"(Treves Exercise 5.4) Let $E$ be a TVS and $E^*$ its algebraic dual. Provide $E^*$ with the topology of pointwise convergence in $E$. A basis of neighborhoods of zero in this topology is provided by the sets
  $$W(S,\epsilon) = \left\{x^* \in E^* : \sup\limits_{x\in S} |x^*(x)| \leq \epsilon\right\} $$
  as $S$ ranges over the family of finite subsets of $E$ and $\epsilon$ over the set of numbers $>$ 0. Prove that $E^*$ is complete. This is what I have so far: Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a Cauchy filter on $E^*$. Define $\Phi_x:E^* \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by $$\Phi_x(x^*) = x^*(x). $$
Then $\Phi_x$ is continuous and linear, which implies $\Phi_x$ is uniformly continuous.
Hence $\Phi_x\mathscr{F}$ is a Cauchy filter on $\mathbb{C}$.
But $\mathbb{C}$ is complete, so there exists a $\lambda_x \in \mathbb{C}$
such that $\Phi_x\mathscr{F} \rightarrow \lambda_x$.
This defines a function $\varphi^*:E\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by $\varphi^*(x) = \lambda_x$. How can I show that $\varphi^*$ is linear so that $\varphi^* \in E^*$? Also, how would I show $\mathscr{F} \rightarrow \varphi^*$?","['functional-analysis', 'topological-vector-spaces']"

1687399,Lipschitz image of a measure zero set,"The problem is: Let $f$ be Lipschitz with constant $M$. Show that if $E \subseteq [0,1]$ is of measure zero, then $f(E)$ is of measure zero. My attempt: Let $\epsilon > 0$, and choose a countable covering of $E$ by open intervals $\{U_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^\infty |U_i| < \epsilon/M$. By the intermediate value theorem, $V_i := f((a_i,b_i))$ is also an interval, and for any two points $f(x), f(y) \in V_i$, we have $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq M|x-y| < M|U_i|$. Hence $|V_i| < M|U_i|$, and
$$
\sum_{i=1}^\infty |V_i| < M \sum_{i=1}^\infty |U_i| = M \cdot \frac{\epsilon}{M} = \epsilon.
$$
Since the $V_i$ cover $E$, we conclude that $f(E)$ is of measure zero. Comments: I have made two large assumptions here: 1) that the $V_i$ cover $f(E)$, but I think this is true since the $U_i$ cover $E$, and 2) the estimate on the measure of $V_i$. I actually don't think that is correct.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1687490,Variable leaving basis in linear programming - when does it happen?,"In the simplex algorithm in linear programming , what are conditions for a variable to leave a basis (not necessarily basis for the/an optimal solution) ? I'm supposed to list as many sufficient and necessary conditions as possible for some basic variable $x_q$ which could be slack, artificial or non-slack and non-artificial. Let $x_q$ be the s-th basic variable. Suppose the s-th row of some current simplex tableau has 1 in the column of $x_q$ and 0's everywhere else. Under what circumstances, if any, might $x_q$ leave the basis? Can any of the values in the s-th row of the tableau ever change? Well since it's a basic variable, I'm guessing the $x_q$ column already has 0's everywhere except in the s-th row. Now, the $x_q$ row has 0's everywhere in the column of $x_q$ like: This is in the context of the Big M Method and artificial variables . I'm not quite sure what the relationship is exactly, though. Edit: It looks like one of the constraints is the original (maximisation?) problem has something like $$x_2 = 10$$ or $$x_4 = 0$$ I guess the relationship would be Big M Method applies for equality constraint? But I think an equality constraint like for example $$x_4 = 0$$ would lead to $$x_4 + x_5 = 0$$ with $z$ being replaced with $z' = z - Mx_5$ So $$x_4 + x_5 = 0$$ doesn't exactly lead to a row of all but one zero entry? There are two non-zero entries? What I tried: $x_q$ leaves if there is some non-basic variable $x_r$ that enters because $$z_r - c_r < 0$$ $$z_r - c_r = \min_j (z_j - c_j)$$ $$\frac{b_q'}{a_{qr}'} = \min_i \{\frac{b_i'}{a_{ir}'} | a_{ir}' > 0 \}$$ Is that right? Any other sufficient or necessary conditions? What is the relevance of the 0's in the row? Edit: I guess an example would be something like \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0 & 10\\ 
0 & 1 & 0\\ 
5 & 0 & 6
\end{bmatrix} If $x_q$ leaves and then $x_r$ enters where $x_q$'s column is the second column, and then $x_r$ is, say, the first column. What would be the EROs? $$\color{red}{\frac{1}{2}R_1 + R_2 \to R_2}$$
$$-2R_2 + R_1 \to R_1$$
$$-5R_2 + R_3 \to R_3$$ I have never had to make $\color{red}{\text{a zero entry to a non-zero number}}$ in the simplex method. I find this suspicious. Should I not? Perhaps the elements in the row can never change because $x_q$ can never leave? Or $x_q$ can never leave because row can never change?","['inequality', 'optimization', 'linear-programming', 'operations-research', 'linear-algebra']"

1687666,What does probability really mean?,"I apologize in advance if the question is a bit off-topic and not strictly mathematical. To be clear, I'm talking about classical probability which is defined like this: Given a finite sample space $S$, and a subset of $S$ which we call event $E$, the probability $P(E)$ of event $E$ is $$P(E)=\dfrac{N(E)}{N(S)}$$ Where $N$ denotes the number of the elements of a set. I wanna understand what notion we try to capture when we define probability. Bernoulli, Laplace and others certainly had a certain concept in mind that they wanted to describe and hence they formalized it into this definition. To explain my point, consider the following example: We have a set of data, say, a bunch of real numbers and we want to represent them using a single real number. So the notion we wanna capture here is finding a real number that is the best representative to a group of real numbers. It turns out the mean of those numbers is the best representative to them in the sense that it minimizes the sum of the square of differences(distances) between the mean and every real number in that set of data. So what notion we wanna capture by defining probability? I was told that if the probability of an event $E$ in an experiment is say, $0.3$ then if the experiment is performed $n$ number of times, $0.3n$ of times event $E$ will happen. So this is the notion $P(E)$ supposed to capture. This definition, as far as capturing this concept makes perfect sense to me in the following: -If an event has a $P(E)=0$ then it will never happen. -If an event has a $P(E)=1$ then it will always happen, or if we perform the experiment $n$ times, $E$ will occur $n$ times. However for $P(E)$ that has a value between 0 and 1, I don't know how it works. For example if we tossed a coin 10 times, it's not guaranteed at all that half the tosses will give you head, even worse, all the tosses can sometimes give you tails. So what's going on here? When I asked for the justification that $P(E)$ really captures this notion, I read this is justified by the law of large numbers: You perform an experiment certain number of times, say for example tossing a fair coin. When we calculate the probability of a toss being head, we assign the number $0.5$ to that event. This means(According to my understanding of the law of large numbers) that as the number of tossing the coin gets arbitrarily large(number of trials approaching infinity), Heads will make up $0.5$ of the total number of coins tossed, or a number that's very close to $0.5$ and as the number of trials increase, it will approach $0.5$. However there's something circular about this: When I ask what does ""fair"" coin mean? It's a coin that, as we toss it arbitrarily large number of times, the number of its heads will approach $0.5$. So can someone clear it up for me, and justify why $P(E)$ captures what it captures?",['probability']

I'm stuck on both directions, though assuming $X$ is compact and $Y$ is Hausdorff the projection is clearly closed, but the statement says it must hold for all $Y$ so I'm a bit thrown off. In fact, I might be missing a simple example, but I'm having trouble thinking of a closed subset $A \times B \subseteq X \times Y$ such that $B$ is not closed in $Y$ (which must exist for any $X$ noncompact...).

This question originated in the context of given a finite group $G$ : trying to find the lowest dimensional shape whose rotational/reflection symmetries form $G$ . (Formally stated as finding the lowest dimensional faithful representation of $G$ into the orthogonal group $O(n)$ .) Now just listing out examples is hard, because even in just $\mathbb{R}^2$ outside of the symmetries of simple polygons we see things like $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 $ crop up, yet it appears that $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ doesn't have any obvious two dimensional representations. Grouppropswiki doesn't even have a single representation for it at all. So I thought it was wise before I tackle the orthogonal group question I should know how to just, in general, find a low dimensional faithful representation. Some trivialities are that the dimension for a group $G$ will be less than or equal to the smallest $j$ such that $G \subset S_j$ since each symmetric group can be realized as the symmetries of a $j$ -dimensional simplex space due to Burnside.

Then a Noetherian ring is just a $\aleph_0$-Noetherian ring with this definition (and a principal ring is a $2$-Noetherian domain, but I think that probably only infinite cardinals are really meaningful in this setup). I you prefer non-commutative rings, you may add ""left"" and ""right"" wherever needed. Question 1a: Does such a notion exist somewhere ? Is it interesting, or even useful ? My main question is based on the following observation : if on the other hand you want to generalize the ascending chain condition, then you will naturally get a condition on ordinals , since it is formulated in terms of an order. Namely, you can ask wether there are chains of ideals having the order structure of a given ordinal : if $\alpha$ is an ordinal, a ring $R$ will be said to satisfy $\alpha$-$(AC)$ if there is no strictly increasing function $\alpha \to I(R)$ where $I(R)$ is the set of ideals, given the inclusion order. Then a Noetherian ring is just a ring satisfying $\omega$-$(AC)$. Again, you can add ""left"" or ""right"" if you want to. Question 1b: Same as question 1, for this other notion. So then there are two quite objectively natural notions that generalize Noetherian rings, but one is based on cardinals, and the other on ordinals. There is a sort of ""coincidence"" in the fact that $\omega$ and $\aleph_0$ are pretty much equivalent in the sense that finite ordinals and finite cardinals are really the same thing (same objects, same operations, etc.). But this will no longer be true for higher cardinals and ordinals. Question 2: Should one be considered the right one ?

For $r=1$ , we need to prove that $\Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{q})|\Bbb{Q}$ has degree $2$ , but this is clear since the minimal polynomial of $\sqrt{q}$ over $Q$ is $$P(t)=t^2-q$$ which has degree $2$ . Now let's assume the assertion is true for $r=k$ and prove it for $k+1$ . Consider $$\Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{q_1}, \dots, \sqrt{q_{k+1}})=\Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{q_1}, \dots, \sqrt{q_{k}})( \sqrt{q_{k+1}})$$ Then we have the following chain of inclusions $$\Bbb{Q} \subset \Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{q_1}, \dots, \sqrt{q_{k}}) \subset \Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{q_1}, \dots, \sqrt{q_{k}})( \sqrt{q_{k+1}}) $$ Thus $$[\Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{q_1}, \dots, \sqrt{q_{k+1}}):\Bbb{Q}]=[\Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{q_1}, \dots, \sqrt{q_{k+1}}):\Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{q_1},\dots, \sqrt{q_{k}})]\cdot [\Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{q_1}, \dots, \sqrt{q_{k}}):\Bbb{Q}]=2\cdot 2^k$$ since the minimal polynomial of $\sqrt{q_{k+1}}$ over $ \Bbb{Q}(\sqrt{q_1}, \dots, \sqrt{q_{r}})$ is $$P(t)=t^2-q_{k+1}$$ which again has degree $2$ .

1688558,"Sufficient Conditions for $(R,+,.)$ to be a commutative ring","Today, in class, my algebra professor stated this particular general result. Theorem. Let $R$ be a ring of order $pq$ where $p,q$ are two primes with $p\gt q$ and $q\not\mid (p-1)$. Then, $R$ is a commutative ring. My question is: Do we require the condition $q\not\mid (p-1)$ ? Here's a proof attempt where we don't consider the above condition: Proof. Since $(R,+,.)$ is a ring, we know that $(R,+)$ is an abelian group. Now, since $p,q$ are primes and $(R,+)$ is a group, we know by Cauchy's theorem that there exists two elements $a,b\in R$ such that $|a|=p$ and $|b|=q$. Now, since $p\gt q$, we know that they are distinct primes and hence $\gcd(p,q)=1$. So, we have, $$|a+b|=|a||b|=pq=|R|\implies (R,+)=\langle a+b\rangle$$ Denote $a+b$ by $g$. Then, since $(R,+)$ is cyclic, we have, $$\forall x,y\in R~\exists m,n\in\Bbb Z\mid x=mg~,~y=ng\\~\\ xy=(mg)(ng)=mn(gg)=nm(gg)=(ng)(mg)=yx$$ using the distributive laws. Hence, $(R,+,.)$ is a commutative ring. So, does my proof work and the additional condition is not required? Or is there any error in my thinking?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'group-theory', 'cyclic-groups']"

1688662,"Tricky proof of a result of Michael Nielsen's book ""Neural Networks and Deep Learning"".","In his free online book, ""Neural Networks and Deep Learning"", Michael Nielsen proposes to prove the next result: If $C$ is a cost function which depends on $v_{1}, v_{2}, ..., v_{n}$, he states that we make a move in the $\Delta v$ direction to decrease $C$ as much as possible, and that's equivalent to minimizing $\Delta C \approx \nabla C \cdot \Delta v$. So if $\lvert\lvert\Delta v\rvert\rvert = \epsilon$ for a small $\epsilon$, it can be proved that the choice of $\Delta v$ that minimizes $\Delta C \approx \nabla C \cdot \Delta v$ is $\Delta v = -\eta \nabla C$ where $\eta = \epsilon / \lvert\lvert \nabla C \rvert\rvert$. And he suggests using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to prove this. Ok, so what I've done is to minimize with respect to $\Delta v$ an equivalent function $0 = min_{\Delta v} \lvert\lvert \nabla C \Delta v \rvert\rvert^{2} \leq min_{\Delta v}\lvert\lvert \nabla C \rvert\rvert^{2}\lvert\lvert \Delta v\rvert\rvert^{2}$ (using C-S inequality).

1688665,Is it true that $\mathbb{F}_{1}^{\ast} \equiv \mathbb{F}_{2}^{\ast}$ implies $\mathbb{F}_{1} \equiv \mathbb{F}_{2}$?,"Let $\mathbb{F}_{1}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ be fields, and let $\mathbb{F}_{1}^{\ast}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{\ast}$ denote the corresponding groups of units.  If $\mathbb{F}_{1}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ are not elementarily equivalent in the language of rings, does it follow that $\mathbb{F}_{1}^{\ast}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{\ast}$ are not elementarily equivalent in the language of groups? For example, $\mathbb{R} \not\equiv \mathbb{C}$, and $\mathbb{R}^{\ast} \not\equiv \mathbb{C}^{\ast}$ since (for example) the sentence $$ \exists x \ x^4 = 1, x^2 \neq 1 $$ holds in $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$ and does not hold in $\mathbb{R}^{\ast}$. Similarly, $\mathbb{Q} \not\equiv \mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{Q}^{\ast} \not\equiv \mathbb{R}^{\ast}$ since (for example) the sentence $$ \exists x \ x^2 = 1, x \neq 1, \forall y \ \exists z \ (y = z^2) \vee (xy = z^2)$$ holds in $\mathbb{R}^{\ast}$, but not in $\mathbb{Q}^{\ast}$. It is natural to consider the contrapositive of this problem: is it true that $\mathbb{F}_{1}^{\ast} \equiv \mathbb{F}_{2}^{\ast} \Longrightarrow \mathbb{F}_{1} \equiv \mathbb{F}_{2}$? I suspect that this is not in general true, mainly because there are many well-known examples of groups which are elementarily equivalent but not isomorphic. So it seems plausible that one may use groups $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ which are known to satisfy $G_{1} \equiv G_{2}$ and $G_{1} \not\cong G_{2}$ to construct elementarily inequivalent fields $\mathbb{F}_{1}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ such that the underlying multiplicative group of $\mathbb{F}_{1}$ (resp. $\mathbb{F}_{2}$) is $G_{1}$ (resp. $G_{2}$). For example, it is known that given an abelian group $A$, $A$ has unbounded exponent if and only if $A \equiv A \oplus \mathbb{Q}$ (Lemma A.2.4. in Hodges' ""Model Theory""). Therefore, $\mathbb{Q} \oplus \mathbb{Q} \equiv \mathbb{Q}$. But is the additive group $\mathbb{Q}$ the underlying multiplicative group of a field? Is $\mathbb{Q} \oplus \mathbb{Q}$ the group of units of a field? As early as 1960, Laszlo Fuchs asked which abelian groups can be realized as the underlying multiplicative group of a field. This question remains largely unanswered. However, it is known that: Theorem: A nontrivial torsion-free divisible abelian group $G$ has infinite rank if and only if $G$ can be realized as the underlying multiplicative group a field (see ""Divisible Multiplicative Groups of Fields"" by Greg Oman). Therefore, there exist fields $\mathbb{F}_{1}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ such that $\mathbb{F}_{1}^{\ast} = \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{\ast} = \mathbb{Q} \oplus \mathbb{Q}$. But it is not obvious as to whether or not these fields are elementarily equivalent.","['model-theory', 'field-theory', 'group-theory']"

where $s$ is denominator of $p$; Finally, if $\frac{m+1}{n}+p \in \mathbb{Z}$ then we use substitution
$(a+bx^{-n})^p=t^s$ where $s$ is denominator of $p$. If we look at this example: $$\int x^{\frac{1}{2}}(2-x)^{\frac{-1}{2}}dx,$$ we can see that $m=\frac{1}{2}$, $n=1$, and $p=\frac{-1}{2}$ which means that we have to use third substitution since $\frac{m+1}{n}+p = \frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2}=1$ but when I use that substitution I get even more complicated integral with square root. But, when I tried second substitution I have this: $$2-x=t^2 \Rightarrow 2-t^2=x \Rightarrow dx=-2tdt,$$ so when I implement this substitution I have: $$\int \sqrt{2-t^2}\frac{1}{t}(-2tdt)=-2\int \sqrt{2-t^2}dt.$$ This means that we should do substitution once more, this time: $$t=\sqrt{2}\sin y \Rightarrow y=\arcsin\frac{t}{\sqrt{2}} \Rightarrow dt=\sqrt{2}\cos ydy.$$ So now we have: \begin{align*}
-2\int \sqrt{2-2\sin^2y}\sqrt{2}\cos ydy={}&-4\int\cos^2ydy = -4\int \frac{1+\cos2y}{2}dy={} \\
{}={}& -2\int dy -2\int \cos2ydy = -2y -\sin2y.

-2\arcsin\frac{t}{2} -2\sin y\cos y ={}& -2\arcsin\frac{t}{2} -2\frac{t}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt\frac{2-t^2}{2}={} \\

\end{align*} Now to $x$: $$-2\arcsin\sqrt{\frac{2-x}{2}} - \sqrt{2x-x^2},$$ which would be just fine if I haven't checked the solution to this in workbook where the right answer is: $$2\arcsin\sqrt\frac{x}{2} - \sqrt{2x-x^2},$$ and when I found the derivative of this, it turns out that the solution in workbook is correct, so I made a mistake and I don't know where, so I would appreciate some help, and I have a question, why the second substitution works better in this example despite the theorem i mentioned above which says that I should use third substitution for this example?","['integration', 'calculus']"

1689101,Intuition for Proving if a Set is Dense,"I'm having trouble building intuition for whether or not a set is dense in another set. I've read this reference , which was helpful, but I'm having a few outstanding questions. The examples provided in the link are obvious, and they don't really give me a good sense of how I would go about writing proofs or dis-proofs of denseness. For example, I was posed the following two problems that, just looking at the provided reference, I don't have a clue how to tackle: Are the following sets dense in $[0, 1]$? $\{\sin n \,| \,n \in \Bbb{N}\}$ $\{frac(\pi^n) \,| \,n \in \Bbb{N}\}$ Where $frac$ is the fractional part of a number. Are there any (better) references out there that can help me better understand not only what denseness is , but also how I should start proofs of this type?","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"
1689199,Proof convergence implies $\liminf = \limsup$.,"I have yet to see very straightforward proofs that convergence of a sequence implies equality of $\liminf$ and $\limsup$, so I'd like to attempt to present one here: Statement: If $\{a_k\}$ converges, $$\liminf_{ k \to \infty} \{a_k\} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} \{a_k\}.$$ Proof: Let $\epsilon >0$. Recall that $$\liminf_{ k \to \infty} \{a_k\} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \inf_{k \geq n} \{a_k\},$$ since $\inf_{k \geq n} \{a_k\}$ is monotonically decreasing in $n$. Similarly for $\limsup$. Thus, there is $N_1$ so that if $n \geq N_1$, $$\left|\liminf_{ k \to \infty} \{a_k\} - \inf_{k \geq n} \{a_k\}\right| < \frac{\epsilon}{4} \qquad(1)$$ and 
$$\left|\limsup_{ k \to \infty} \{a_k\} - \sup_{k \geq n} \{a_k\}\right| < \frac{\epsilon}{4} \qquad (2).$$ Now, since the sequence converges, it is cauchy. Let $N_2$ be such that for $n,m \geq N_2$, $$\left|a_n-a_m\right| < \frac{\epsilon}{8}.$$ Let $N = \max\{N_1,N_2\}$. By the definition of inf, there exists $a_j$ with $j \geq N$ so that $$\left|a_j - \inf_{k \geq N} \{a_k\}\right| < \frac{\epsilon}{8}$$ and so, for $n \geq N$, $$\left|a_n - \inf_{k \geq N} \{a_k\}\right| < \frac{\epsilon}{4} \qquad (3)$$ by the triangle inequality, and the fact that the sequence is cauchy. Similarly, for $n \geq N$, $$\left|a_n - \sup_{k \geq N} \{a_k\}\right| < \frac{\epsilon}{4} \qquad (4).$$ Combining (1)-(4), we obtain $$\left|\liminf_{ k \to \infty} \{a_k\} - \limsup_{ k \to \infty} \{a_k\} \right| < \epsilon$$ and since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, we have our desired equality. Indeed, although this proof may be longer than standard proofs, I believe it more accurately portrays to the students that we are trying to control oscillation after some index, similar to the oscillation of a continuous function i.e. show that this proof is essentially the discrete analogue of the proof that a function is continuous iff its oscillation tends to 0.","['real-analysis', 'proof-verification', 'proof-writing', 'sequences-and-series', 'analysis']"

My attempt: I tried to find, $\phi^{i}$, $i\in I,$ functions, holomorphic, bounded over the unit disk, such that, $$B = \{\phi^{i} : i\in I\}$$ has uncountably many members and for every $i,j\in I$ with $i \neq j$, there exists a M>0 : $\|\phi^{i} - \phi^{j}\|{\tiny{\infty}}>M$. But I cant find a spesific example that works. I tried for example $\phi^{t}(z) = e^{it}f(z)$ where $f\in H^{\infty}$.

1689220,On the exactness of the calculus formulas,"Are calculus formulas, differentiation and  integration, exact formulas or are some approximations involved? That is, is the value of a definite integral of a function the exact value of the (signed) area between the graph and the axis or is it only any approximation for it, and likewise for the value of the derivative and the slope of the tangent at this point. The question arises as when introducing these notions approximations are often  central, say, via Riemann sums. It is now not clear if the definite integral is another (sometimes more viable) way to get an approximation or if it is exact and the same for derivative and slope of the tangent.","['derivatives', 'integration', 'calculus']"

1689314,Why is a $\sigma$-algebra defined as such?,"We know that a $\sigma$-algebra is a collection of sets closed under countable set operations. My question is: how was it determined that this is the right collection? i.e., how was it determined that these are the sets that reasonably should be measurable. As an analogue, we know that the definition of a topology comes from the behaviour of the collection of open sets in $\mathbb R^n$, and the fact that continuity may be rephrased as a statement about open sets. That is, the generalization of taking the essential property of behaviour of open sets and continuity is intuitive. I've never heard nor read an explanation in the same spirit of this one for a $\sigma$-algebra. I'd assume in the same sense, this comes from what subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ we should expect to be Lebesgue Measurable , and then generalizing to arbitrary measures. Or Is there some way to show this is the maximal collection of sets for any measure? That is, does the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra come from some maximality property, or does it come from some generalization of Lebesgue Measurable Sets? I've done a bit of research on the topic and come up short of an answer, so any discussion of the subject would be appreciated.","['real-analysis', 'math-history', 'measure-theory', 'general-topology', 'analysis']"

1689393,Irreducible polynomials and irreducible varieties,"I need some help with an exercise (proved half of it but now I'm stuck on the other half). This is an exercise from Smith's book about algebraic geometry: Show that a hypersurface in $\mathbb A^n$ is irreducible if and only if the defining equation $F$ is a power of an irreducible polynomial $G$. Here is what I have so far: Proof: $\implies$: Let $V(F)$ be a hypersurface in $\mathbb A^n$. Assume $F$ is not a power of an irreducible polynomial. Then $F$ can be factored as $F = GH$ for some non-constant polynomials $G,H$. But then $V(F) = V(G)\cup V(H)$ is a union of two non-empty proper subvarieties hence reducible. Is this correct so far? And this is the part that I'm stuck with: $\Longleftarrow$: Now assume $F=G^n$ where $G$ is irreducible. Then $V(F) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n V(G) = V(G)$. I want to say something like ""Then $V(G)$ does not contain two non-empty proper subvarieties because $G$ is irreducible"" but it's not so clear to me how to prove this.
