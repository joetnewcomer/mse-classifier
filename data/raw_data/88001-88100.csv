1179491,Explicit bijection between $\mathbb N$ and $\mathbb N \times \mathbb N$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Inverting the Cantor pairing function (3 answers) Closed 9 years ago . We can consider the quadratic scheme above for a possible explicit bijection between  $\mathbb N$ and $\mathbb N \times \mathbb N$. The part $\mathbb N \times \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ is easy via $(m,n) \mapsto m + \frac{(n + m)\cdot(n + m + 1)}{2}$ for $m$ going down (as row index) and $n$ going right (as column index).

1179515,Division of items into groups,"The book i'm reading says the following : Number of ways in which $(m+n+p)$ items can be distributed into $m$, $n$ and $p$ sized groups is $$\frac{(m+n+p)!}{m!n!p!}$$ I understand this is called the book-keeper's rule. So, following from this, if m=n=p, then this formula should become $$\frac{(3n)!}{(n!)^3}$$ Generalising, if we have m groups of n items each, the formula should be $$\frac{(mn)!}{(n!)^m}$$ BUT the book breaks into a new section, and says : The number of ways $mn$ stuff can be divided equally into $m$ groups of $n$ item each is : $$\frac{(mn)!}{(n!)^m(m!)}$$ Whereas, The number of ways $mn$ stuff can be distributed equally into $m$ groups of $n$ item each is : $$\frac{(mn)!}{(n!)^m}$$ Why the two different formulas ?

We can show that $\mathcal{F}\neq \emptyset.$ Partially order $\mathcal{F}$ by extension and use Zorn's Lemma to obtain a maximal element $g:B\times B\rightarrow B.$ To complete the proof we shall show that $|A|=|B|=\alpha.$ Suppose $|A-B|>|B|.$ Then there is a subset $C$ of $A-B$ such that $|C|=|B|.$ Verify that $|C|=|B|=|B\times B|=|B\times C|=|C\times B|=|C\times C|$ and that these sets are mutually disjoint. Consequently we have $|(B\cup C)\times (B\cup C)|=|B\times B|+ |B\times C|+ |C\times B|+ |C\times C|=(|B|+|B|)+(|C|+|C|)=|B|+|C|=|B\cup C|.$ Then there is a bijection $h: (B\cup C)\times (B\cup C)\rightarrow B\cup C.$  He says that contradicts the maximality of $g$ in $\mathcal{F}.$ Why?

t' &= kn \\
n' &= -kt - \tau b \\
b' &= \tau n.
\end{align} Now, I've shown that if $\alpha(t)$ is a plane curve, then $\tau = 0$. Thus, our equations give: $$t'' = -t$$ and $$b'=0.$$ From the first equation we have that, \begin{align}
t'' &= t'\\ 
\implies \alpha'''(s)&=-\alpha'(s)\\
\implies \alpha(s) &= c_1sinx+c_2cosx+c_3.
\end{align} It seems like I may be on the right track... though I have not yet used the fact that $\alpha$ is a closed curve. Or is there a different approach I should take? *Also, I have moved the other direction: I have previously shown that a circle possesses curvature $\frac{1}{r}$ where $r$ is its radius. A circle of radius one, then has curvature 1. This proof doesn't work the other direction. *For reference, I'm almost exclusively using Do Carmo's Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces Thx! Update: No one has answered with anything yet, but here's another idea: Do Carmo asks that we prove the existence of an Osculating Circle. Here's an idea for that: Let there be two points $s_0$ and $s_1$ on $\alpha(s)$. Let their corresponding normals intersect at point which we will define as the center of a circle. Let ${s_0}$ approach ${s_1}$. Now show the limiting position of the intersection of normals becomes the center of an osculating circle (i.e., a circle with a tangent that coincides with the tangent of our curve at $s_1$) and the limiting position of the circle become the osculating circle. We may then prove that the radius of this circle is $\frac{1}{k(s)}$ Is this correct and how may I approach this?",['differential-geometry']

1180000,Weil does not imply Cartier on variety $X$.,"Show that the divisor $D$ defined by $a = b = 0$ in the variety $X \subset \mathbb{A}^4$ defined  by $ad - bc = 0$ $($the cone on a smooth quadric surface$)$ is not locally principal. My attempt at proof is as follows. If $D \cap U = X \cap V(f) \cap U$ for some $f \in k[a, b, c, d]$ and some nonempty open $U \subset \mathbb{A}^4$, then we can assume that $f$ is homogenous. We have a picture in $\mathbb{P}^3$. The resulting $($effective$)$ Cartier divisor should extend to a Cartier divisor on $\mathbb{P}^3$, thus its associated line bundle is a pullback of some $\mathcal{O}(d)$ for $d$ positive. I know that if $S: \mathbb{P}^m \times \mathbb{P}^n \to \mathbb{P}^N$ is the Segre embedding, we have $S^*\mathcal{O}(1) \cong \pi_1^*\mathcal{O}(1) \otimes \pi_2^*\mathcal{O}(1)$. Now, the pullback of the aforementioned is $\mathcal{O}(d) \otimes \mathcal{O}(d)$ on $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$; this gives us a contradiction because the divisor is $a = b = 0$, which is not really a thing (does not pullback to a divisor of $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$). EDIT: An easier way to finish is to just check the tangent space. One of these is $2$, the other one is at least $3$. I am not completely sure if this approach is completely correct though. Some feedback would be appreciated.

I'm sure I need to use the result of the first part of the problem but I am not sure where to begin.

I think my background is a little lacking on remembering the relation between the summation symbols and the integral symbol in general. I see clearly that we are increasing, but why choose the interval $[k,k-1]$ for example? is it just an arbitrary interval for which we can use the fact that we have an increasing so we can write $x^{q} \le k^{q}$ Then I am confused overall, about the geometric meaning and such. for example how is it true and what is the meaning of writing  $$\int_0^n x^q dx = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \int_{k-1}^k x^q dx \leq \sum_{k=1}^{n} \int_{k-1}^k k^q dx  $$ . How can I know/see/understand what this is saying is true? and vice versa for the other inequality. So overall I am looking for any help on that, and with the limit.

The examples which I know are always quasi-projective, so I suspect that $P$ is always quasi-projective, but I can not find any relevant references.

1180084,About a sequence related with the complete elliptic integral of the second kind,"When answering this related question I proved that if we define $B(\lambda)$ as: $$\begin{eqnarray*} B(\lambda)&=&\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\sqrt{\lambda^2+1-2\lambda\cos\theta}\,d\theta=\sum_{n\geq 0}\left(\frac{\binom{2n}{n}}{(2n-1)\,4^n}\right)^2\lambda^{2n}\\&=&\phantom{}_2 F_1\left(-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2};1;\lambda^2\right)\end{eqnarray*}$$
we have:
$$ \int_{0}^{1} \lambda\,B(\lambda)\,d\lambda = \frac{16}{9\pi} $$
since $B(\lambda)$ satisfies the ODE:
$$ \lambda\, B = (\lambda^2+1)B'+(\lambda-\lambda^3)B''.$$
With the same technique it is not difficult to prove that, if we define $A_k$ as: $$ A_k = \int_{0}^{1}x^{2k+1}\,B(x)\,dx $$ we have $A_0=\frac{16}{9\pi}$ and: $$ (2k+3)^2\,A_k = \frac{16}{\pi}+(2k)^2\,A_{k-1}. \tag{0}$$ Now the question. Is it possible to give a nice closed form to $A_k$, given $(0)$? $A_k$ appears to be related with a partial sum of the series converging to the Catalan constant, namely: $$\frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{j=0}^{k+1}\frac{(-1)^j}{(2j+1)^2}.$$ From the recurrence relation it follows that:
$$ A_k = \frac{16}{\pi(2k+3)^2}+\frac{16}{\pi}\left(\frac{(2k)!!}{(2k+3)!!}\right)^2\sum_{j=1}^{k}\left(\frac{(2k+3-2j)!!}{(2k-2j)!!}\right)^2$$

1180721,Dedekind Cuts and Computable Numbers,"Can someone please tell me where I'm wrong? I'm not able to figure out where is the error: First let's define what a computable number is: a number is computable if there is a Turing Machine that can return the decimal expansion of that number with arbitrary precision. 1) Rational are computable by a Turing Machine.
Since all rational can be written by definition like a quotient of two integers: n/m, for any rational there must exist an algorithm that compute that number. We call this type of Turing Machine: ""ArbitraryPrecisionQNumber"". 
It is important to note that even if I'm not able to see how to construct the Turing Machine for example the rational: ""a² < 2"". This Turing Machine must exist by definition. 2) Dedekind cuts are defined with 2 rationals. 3) The pair of rationals that defines the Dedekind cut can be computed with 2 Turing Machines. From my point of view this 2 Turing Machines describes completely the Dedekind cut since the are able to compute the 2 rational numbers with arbitrary precision. 4) The number of Turing Machines is countable and the number of two Turing Machines is also countable since it is equivalent of the claim that ordered pairs of natural numbers are countable. Lets ""choice"" a pair of ""ArbitraryPrecisionQNumber"" Turing Machines that validates the property of expressing a Dedekind cut: for example the TM that computes the rational a² < 2 and the TM that computes the rational b² > 2 for the square root of 2. It is important to note that even if this property between the two Turing Machines can not be verified this pair must exist since The two Turing Machine exist. (this is a non constructive argument and I think that we must invoke the axiom of choice to be able to talk about this pair). We can construct a Turing Machine called ""ArbitraryPrecisionRealNumber made of this pair of ""ArbitraryPrecisionQNumber"" that compute any real number defined with a Dedekind cut. In essence we can say: ""this construction of a Turing Machine is a description of the real number defined by the Dedekind Cut"". The problem with this sentence is evident since we have: 1) the set of Dedekind cuts forms a bijection with the set of reals. 2) there are as many Dedekind cuts as reals. So the set of Dedekind cuts are uncountable. So we have a set of countable Turing Machine of every Dedekind cut but the set of Dedekind cut is uncountable. I think that this also can be restated in the following manner:
There are uncomputable reals but all Dedekind cut can be computed. UPDATE: I think all the problem comes from this point:
""Dedekind cuts are defined with 2 rationals"" I will elaborate a little bit more my thoughts. It is true that from an ""absolute perspective"" Dedekind Cut can not be defined by 2 rationals. One good argument for this is that a rational set does not have a supremum for example so you are not able to define a Turing Machine that compute this (non-existent) number. I was more concerned with an ""infinite approximation"" perspective of a real. In my opinion if we define a process that can define in the limit a real number (at infinity) then it is a definition of a real number So in fact we could restate all this question like this:
""Could we define 2 Turing Machines that approximates from above and from bellow to the infinity a real number?"" If we can, then I think the conclusion that I gave is correct and this two TM would be equivalent to Dedekind Cuts. I had doubts if this could be possible but if the real number is no definable in a finite way then this two Turing Machines does not exist by definition. The main issue with my argument is the next one: there is infinite undefinable real numbers. Thanks a lot for all your comments.","['computability', 'elementary-set-theory']"

s.t $u_{\epsilon_k} \rightarrow u \in C(I,L^2(M))$ in norm for all compact $I\subset \mathbb{R}$; hence, $g(J_{\epsilon_k}u_{\epsilon_k})\rightarrow g(u)$ in $C(\mathbb{R}, L^2(M))$, and $u$ solves the original semilinear hyperbolic pde. Examine the issue of uniqueness. My problem is in exercise 13, I thought that the first part is a simple conclusion from problem 12 of Arzela-Ascoli theorem, but I am not sure it that's much easy. As for the uniqueness part, I believe we need to use here Gronwall's inequality on the norm, we get for if two solutions of the semilinear hyperbolic pde, $u1,u2$, then by denoting $w=u1-u2$, and $h(w)=g(u1)-g(u2):
$$\| w(t) \|_{L^2}^2  = (w(0),w(t)) + \int_0^t (Lw(s)+h(w(s)), w(t))ds$$ I need somehow to estimate $(Lw(s),w(t))$ from above, which I don't see how.
I see how to esitamte $(h(w(s)),w(t)$, by Cauchy-Schwarz we have $(h(w(s)),w(t))\le \|h(w(s))\|_{L^2} \| w(t)\|_{L^2}$, $\| h(w(s)) \|_{L^2} = \| w(s)\int_0^1 h'(rw)dr \|_{L^2} \le \| w(s)\|_{L^2} \| \int_0^1 h'(rw)dr\|_{L^{\infty}} \le 2C \| w(s) \|_{L^2} \sup_{v\in \mathbb{R}^n} |h'(v)| \le 2C\| w(s) \|_{L^2}$, since $|h'(v)|=|g'(u2+v)-g'(u2)| \le C+C =2C$.

A cubic hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^{4}$ that passes through $7$ points in general position with multiplicity $2$ is not expected to exist. Nevertheless, it exists, and I am trying to understand Miranda's example. There exists a rational normal curve $X$ that passes through $7$ points in general position in $\mathbb{P}^{4}$. Let $S(X)$ be its secant variety. $S(X)$ is supposed to be the variety we are looking for. The secant variety of an irreducible curve is three-dimensional unless the curve is contained in a plane. A rational normal curve in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ spans $\mathbb{P}^{n}$, so it is not contain in a plane. According to this, dim$(S(X))=3$. Now, why is the degree of $S(X)$ equal to $3$? I think it suffices to show that any $l\in\mathbb{G}(1,4)-S(X)$ satisfies $\#X\cap l=3$, but I am not able to prove it. Now, let's suppose that $S(X)$ passes through any of the seven points $p$ with multiplicity $1$. Then dim $T_{p}S(X)=3$. Since $X$ spans $\mathbb{P}^{4}$, there are secant lines to $X$ that contain $p$ in $4$ independent directions. I am not able to understand why this fact contradicts dim $T_{p}S(X)=3$. Is $\{l\in\mathbb{G}(1,4):\text{l is secant to $X$ and $p\in l$}\}\subseteq T_{p}S(X)$? Any help would be appreciated.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

I'm studying Hyperkahler geometry (principally on works by Huybrechts, Markman and O'Grady) and I am wondering why one wants to look at the structure of a particular cone in order to get geometric properties about the object he is studying. I can understand that if you want to study problems regarding projectivity then it is useful to look at the ample cone. And if you are interested in the Kahler geometry then you can look at the Kahler cone. Anyway, for example, I cannot see the following: one of the claims (or one of the conseguences, if you want) of the Global Torelli Theorem for Hyperkahler manifolds states that a marked pair $(X,\eta)\in\mathfrak{M}_{\Lambda}$ (where $X$ is an Hyperkahler, $\eta:H^2(X,\mathbb{Z})\to\Lambda$ is a marking and $\mathfrak{M}_{\Lambda}$ is the moduli space of such pairs) is an Hausdorff point in $\mathfrak{M}_{\Lambda}$ if and only if the positive cone $\mathcal{C}_X$ coincides with the Kahler cone $\mathcal{K}_X$, i.e. $\mathcal{C}_X=\mathcal{K}_X$. Why did the author decide to look at the Kahler cone and not at some other cones? In the last period, I am been introduced in a lot of cones (apart from positive, ample and Kahler, also the Mori amd bimeromorphic ones) but I cannot fairly see the geometric meaning of them. Can you suggest me some results (expecially on Hyperkahler manifolds) obtained by the study of one of these cones, specifying which is the geometric intuition behind the choise of that cone?

1181593,Measure of $E$ is the limit of the measure of the open set $\mathcal{O}_n$,"Suppose $E$ is a given set, and $\mathcal{O}_n$ is the open set: $$\mathcal{O}_n=\{x : d(x,E) < \frac 1n \}.$$ Show: (a) If $E$ is compact, then $m(E)=\lim_{n \to \infty} m(\mathcal{O}_n)$ . (b) However, the condition in (a) may be false for $E$ closed and unbounded, or $E$ open and unbounded. This is from Real Analysis, Stein and Shakarchi: Chapter 1, Exercise 7. I am doing part (a) only. (a)Since $E$ is compact, $E$ is closed, and so $E$ is measurable. Also, $\mathcal{O}_n$ is an open set as given, which menas $\mathcal{O}_n$ is measurable. If $x \in E$ , then $d(x,E) = 0 < \frac 1n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Hence, $x \in \mathcal{O}_n$ , and so $E \subset \mathcal{O}_n$ . Finally, observe that $m(\mathcal{O}_n)$ is monotonically decreasing and bounded; hence, $m(\mathcal{O}_n)$ is convergent. By monotonicity, $m(E) \le m(\mathcal{O}_n)$ , and so $m(E) \le \lim_{n \to \infty} m(\mathcal{O}_n)$ . Question: To establish equality, I must prove the reverse inequality. I have trouble with starting the proof for this. Can I receive a starting hint please?","['general-topology', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
1181612,A property of exponential of operators 2,"Let $X$ be a Banach space. The other day I asked if all bounded operators $A:X\to X$ satisfy the following property: (P) : All bounded nonzero trajectories $t\mapsto e^{tA}x$ satisfy
$$\inf_{t\in \mathbb{R}}|e^{tA}x|>0,$$
where $x\in X$ and $e^{tA}$  is the exponential operator defined by $$e^{tA}:=\sum_{k=0}^{+\infty}\frac{t^kA^k}{k!}.$$
If the operator $A$ is scalar ($A=a\in \mathbb{R}$) or in general $A$ is a matrix  then  the property (P) holds as explained here .
In infinite dimensions, there exist operators which do not satisfy this property as explained by fedga .
So later I observed that operators $A$ such that $t\mapsto e^{t A}$ is bounded on $\mathbb{R}$ satisfy this property because
$$|x|=|e^{-tA}e^{tA}x|\leq\left(\sup_{t\in \mathbb{R}}|e^{-tA}|\right)|e^{tA}x|.$$
For operators such that $t\mapsto e^{tA}$ is not bounded in $t\in \mathbb{R}$, there's examples like: $A=iI$ or maybe $A$ is of finite rank (because it works for matrices). So I just feel like if $t\mapsto e^{tA}$ is not bounded in $t$ and $A$ satisfies (P) , then $A$ must be of finite rank or something. I don't know if this is true or not. I am also interested in ""exponential"" of unbounded operators or what it is known as strongly continuous groups of operators.","['exponential-function', 'operator-theory', 'functional-calculus', 'semigroup-of-operators', 'functional-analysis']"
1181631,"How do you prove the set $G = \{(x, f(x)) \mid x \in \mathbb R\}$ is closed? [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Graph of a continuous function is closed (2 answers) Closed 9 years ago . Let $f : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ continuous. Prove that graph $G = \{(x, f(x)) \mid x \in \mathbb R\}$ is closed. I'm a little confused on how to prove $G$ is closed. I get the general strategy is to show that every arbitrary convergent sequence in $G$ converges to a point in $G$. Here is what I tried so far: Let $x_k$ be a sequence which converges to $x$. Since $f$ is continuous, this implies that $f(x_k)$ converges to $f(x)$. At this point, can you say every $(x_k, f(x_k))$ converges to a $(x, f(x))$, so $G$ is closed?","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"
1181657,How to prove what amounts of postage can be formed with normal mathematical induction?,"This is similar to my other question Strong induction but it addresses standard mathematical induction. Problem: a) Determine which amounts of postage can be formed using just 4 cent stamps and 11 cent stamps.
b) Prove your answers to (a) using the principle of mathematical induction. Be sure to state explicitly your inductive hypothesis in the inductive step. c) Prove your answers to (a) using strong induction. How does the inductive hypothesis in this proof differ from that in the inductive hypothesis for a proof using mathematical induction. My Work I am currently wokring on part b of the problem. For part a, with help from @BaronVT, I was able to find a sequence of four postage amounts - 30, 31, 32, 33- that can be formed using just 4 cent stamps and 11 cent stamps. From that I stated, postage amounts of 30 and more can be formed using just 4 cent stamps and 11 cent stamps. I know for mathematical induction that I have to have a basis step and an inductive step. My basis step was showing that 30(start) can be formed with just using 4 cent stamps and 11 cent stamps $\quad$30 = 11(2) + 4(2) Now the inductive step If $k$ cents, $k$ being some integer $\ge$ 30, can be formed with just using 4 cent stamps and 11 cent stamps, then $k + 1$ cents can also be formed with just using 4 cent stamps and 11 cent stamps. My inductive hypothesis by the way is the ""$k$ cents, $k$ being some integer $\ge$ 30, can be formed with just using 4 cent stamps and 11 cent stamps"" portion of the statement. So now I have the algebraic expressions $\quad$ $k$ = 11a + 4b for some integers a and b, with k $\ge$ 30 $\quad$ $k + 1$ = 11c + 4d for some integers c and d. Where do I go from here? I tried substituting $k$ in the second equation to get $\quad$ 11a + 4b + 1 = 11c + 4d but that didn't get me closer to showing that $k + 1$ cents can be formed with just using 4 cent stamps and 11 cent stamps.","['discrete-mathematics', 'logic', 'recursion', 'computer-science', 'induction']"
1181666,Is there a monotonic function discontinuous over some dense set?,"Can we construct a monotonic function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that there is a dense set in some interval $(a,b)$ for which $f$ is discontinuous at all points in the dense set?  What about a strictly monotonic function? My intuition tells me that such a function is impossible. Here is a rough sketch of an attempt at proving that such a function does not exist: we could suppose a function satisfies these conditions.  Take an $\epsilon > 0$ and two points $x,y$ in this dense set such that $x<y$.  Then, $f(x)<f(y)$ because if they are equal, then the function is constant at all points in between, and there is another element of $X$ between $x$ and $y$, which would be a contradiction.  Take $f(y)-f(x)$.  By the Archimedean property of the reals, $f(y)-f(x)<n\epsilon$ for some $n$. However, after this point, I am stuck.  Could we somehow partition $(x,y)$ into $n$ subintervals and conclude that there must be some point on the dense set that is continuous?","['continuity', 'real-analysis']"
