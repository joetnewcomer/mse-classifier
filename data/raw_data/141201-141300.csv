2281956,Prove that $n=\frac{4^p+1}{5}$ is a strong $2$-pseudoprime for all $p>5$,"I want to prove that $n=\frac{4^p+1}{5}$ is a strong $2$ -pseudoprime for all $p>5$ where $p$ is a prime.
i.e. $n$ is a composite number which passes the Miller-Rabin test. It is easy to check that it is indeed a composite no.
We write $n-1=2^st$ where $t$ is an odd number. $n$ passes the test if either $$a^t\equiv1 \pmod{n}$$ or $$a^{{2^i}t}\equiv-1 \pmod{n}$$ for some $i<s$ . Then $n-1=\frac{4^p+1}{5}-1= \space ... \space=2^2(\frac{4^{p-1}\space-1}{5})$ so $s=2$ and $t=\frac{4^{p-1}\space-1}{5}$ So is $$2^{\frac{4^{p-1}\space-1}{5}}\equiv1\pmod{\frac{4^p+1}{5}}$$ or $$2^{2^1(\frac{4^{p-1}\space-1}{5})} \equiv -1 \pmod{\frac{4^p+1}{5}}$$ ? I checked the results for the first few primes (Yup, WolframAlpha did help).
It turns out that it is always the latter case which holds My guess is that: if $p\equiv3 \space \pmod{4}$ then $2^{\frac{4^{p-1}\space-1}{5}}\equiv2^p \pmod{\frac{4^p+1}{5}}$ if $p\equiv1 \space \pmod{4}$ then $2^{\frac{4^{p-1}\space-1}{5}}\equiv-2^p\space \pmod{\frac{4^p+1}{5}}$ . Squaring both sides and the result follows. Could anyone show why my guess is correct (or not?)?","['number-theory', 'primality-test']"
2281959,Bound on $x^TAx$ for SPD matrix $A$ in terms of its main diagonal,"Let $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be a symmetric positive definite matrix and $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ some vector. I want to find a bound of the form $$x^T Ax \leq c \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} x_i^2$$ with a constant $c>0$ . If $\lambda_\text{min}$ and $\lambda_\text{max}$ denote the smallest and largest eigenvalue of $A$ (both are positive due to spd assumption), then one bound that holds is $$x^T Ax \leq \frac{\lambda_\text{max}}{\lambda_\text{min}} \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} x_i^2.$$ Proof: $$x^TAx \leq \lambda_\text{max} \Vert x\Vert^2 = \frac{\lambda_\text{max}}{\lambda_\text{min}} \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_\text{min} x_i^2 \leq \frac{\lambda_\text{max}}{\lambda_\text{min}} \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} x_i^2$$ where we used that $a_{ii} \geq \lambda_\text{min}$ for all $i$ . However, I think there should be a tighter bound. For example, the inequality holds with $c=1$ if $A$ is diagonal.

Note 1: For all such polynomials, there is always such $s_2$ because of the degrees of polynomials. So the problem is actually depending to $s_0$ and $s_1$. Note 2: Computational, I couldn't find any such $f$. The other version of this question (not same but this one gives that the other one exists) Is it possible to find a such $f$ such that $$f^{(p-1)/2}(x)=s_0(x)+x^{p}s_1(x)+x^{2p}s_2(x)$$ where $s_0,s_1,s_2$ of degree $<p-3$.

2282011,What do we mean when we say the Schur functions form a basis.,"This has always bugged me.  When we are examining symmetric functions (or polynomials if you prefer finitely many variables), we have an easy choice of basis with the monomial symmetric functions.  As this basis tends to be hard to work with, we then look at the complete homogeneous symmetric functions and the elementary symmetric functions.  Finally, we see that to prove things (and to link to Representation theory), it is usually best to work in the Schur basis.  What I don't get is why the Schur basis is indeed a basis.  It is not clear to be because we have the following relationships: $$s_{(i)} = h_{i}$$
$$s_{\left(1^\ell\right)} = e_{\ell}$$ This clearly shows that the complete homogeneous symmetric functions and the elementary symmetric functions are special cases of the Schur functions.  Would this not lead to independence issues for the Schur functions, as there are clearly more Schur functions then the ones described above, which would mean the set of Schur functions is not linearly independent? Thanks for any help, this has driven me crazy for a while!","['symmetric-functions', 'combinatorics', 'algebraic-combinatorics', 'symmetric-polynomials']"

2282180,Probability that these characters win a game.,"I have 11 characters, $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]$, and they all play a game. Game Description: All players stand at the start line $n$ spaces away from finish line. Two fair dice are rolled. The two results on each of the dice are summed up, and it gives a result that is equal to the names of one of the characters. The owner of that number moves forward one space. The winner is the character who gets to the finish line first. For example, on a turn, the dice gives a result of $[3,4]$. Since $3+4=7$, the character 7 moves forward.

2282342,Central limit theorem: Poisson equals Normal? Tell me where I'm wrong,"We just covered the Central Limit theorem in class, and I stumbled upon the following reasoning that makes me think I am missing some key part of... well, something. So, here goes: Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be independent Poisson random variables with parameters $\lambda _1$ and $\lambda _2$ respectively. Then, $X_1 + X_2 \sim P(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)$. By induction, for any finite $n$, if $X_i \sim P(\frac1n)$ iid, $\sum ^n X_i= X \sim P(1)$, and this holds (I think) for $n \to \infty$. But, by the CLT,
$$ \frac{\sum ^n X_i - n\cdot\frac1n}{\sqrt{n\cdot \frac1n}}\to \tilde Y \sim N(0, 1) $$ And rearranging I get $X \to Y \sim N(1, 1)$. But $X$ was a Poisson random variable, therefore discrete, and thus its CDF is constant everywhere except over the integers; while $Y$ is a Normal, and therefore its CDF is never constant.

2282445,"""A two-envelopes puzzle""","This is Problem 1.25 from Tsitsiklis, Bertsekas, Introduction to Probability, 2nd edition. You are handed two envelopes, and you know that each contains a
  positive integer dollar amount and that the two amounts are different.
  The values of these two amounts are modeled as constants that are
  unknown. Without knowing what the amounts are, you select at random
  one of the two envelopes, and after looking at the amount inside, you
  may switch envelopes if you wish. A friend claims that the following
  strategy will increase above $1/2$ your probability of ending up with
  the envelope with the larger amount: Toss a coin repeatedly. Let  $X$  be equal to $1/2$ plus the number of
  tosses required to obtain heads for the first time, and switch if the
  amount in the envelope you selected is less than the value of  $X$ . 
  Is your friend correct? The answer given in the solution manual claims that this indeed helps, and that the probability of getting the better envelope is given by $$p = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} P(B)$$ where $B$ is the event that $a<X<b$, with $a,b$ being the smaller and larger amount of dollars, respectively. I do not buy this solution for the following reason: tossing a coin has nothing to do with the contents of the envelopes. You do not gain any information by doing it. You could just as well count the amount of leaves on a nearby tree instead and use that for $X$. Similarly, opening the first envelope also gives you no useful information about the ordering relation between $a$ and $b$, so surely that's another red herring. Even if you forget the coin tossing, the probability of ""winning"" is still $1/2$, swap or no swap. I suppose maybe the catch is in interpreting the following sentence: ""The values of these two amounts are modeled as constants that are unknown"".

2282620,A Fibonacci identity and $f(Av)=\det(A)f(v)$,"Given a diagonalizable linear transformation $A:V\to V$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, and an eigenbasis $v_1,\ldots v_n$ with $Av_i=\lambda_i v_i$, consider the following procedure to define a function $f_A$. Given a vector $v\in V$, express it as as $v=\sum a_i v_i$.  Let $f_A(v)=\prod a_i$.  This satisfies the nice property that $f_A(Av)=\det(A)f_A(v)$. I came across this construction when trying to find invariants for generalized Fibonacci sequences.  In particular, define $G_0=a, G_1=b, G_{n+1}=G_n+G_{n-1}$ for $n>1$.  Applying this construction to the equation $$ \pmatrix{1 & 1\\ 1 & 0}^n\pmatrix{b \\ a} =\pmatrix{G_n \\ G_{n-1}}$$ yields that $G_{n}G_{n+2}-G_{n+1}^2=(-1)^n(G_0G_2-G_1^2)=(-1)^n(a(a+b)-b^2)$.  In particular, $|G_{n}G_{n+2}-G_{n+1}^2|$ is independent of $n$, so if one wanted to determine whether $(c,d)=(G_n,G_{n+1})$ for some $n$, then a necessary condition is that $c(c+d)-d^2=(-1)^n(a(a+b)-b^2)$. This identity is similar to but more general than the classical identity $F_{n-1}F_{n+1}-F_n^2=(-1)^n$ My question: Has this construction been studied before? Is there a cleaner approach to it?  Does it generalize?  Are there other, better ways to generate functions that satisfy $f(Av)=\det(A)f(v)$? Update: The construction can be rephrased (up to a constant) as $\det(M(v))$ where $M(v)$ is the matrix whose columns are the $A$-eignevectors which sum to $v$.  The property $f(Av)=\det(A)f(v)$ comes from the property that $M(Av)=AM(v)$.  Therefore, this question could be answered by a classification of the maps $V\to \hom(V,V)$ which commute with $A$. I feel like this kind of tensor construction has a better chance of having been studied.","['reference-request', 'linear-algebra', 'tensor-products']"

Consider $F:\mathbf{X}\times\mathbf{Y}\to\mathbf{Y}$ given by $F(x,y):=f(x)-y$ . Then the partial FrÃ©chet derivative $\partial_xF(x^*,y^*)\equiv \mathrm{d}\,f(x^*)$ is bounded with a bounded inverse, so $F$ satisfies the hypotheses of the Implicit Function Theorem. Hence, there are open sets $U\subseteq\mathbf{X}$ and $V\subseteq\mathbf{Y}$ containing $x^*$ and $y^*$ , respectively, and a $\mathcal{C}^k$ function $g:V \to U$ such that $F(g(y), y) = 0$ for all $y\in V$ , i.e. $f(g(y)) = y$ . The above shows that $g$ is a right inverse of $f$ , but I want to be able to conclude, further, that $g$ is a left inverse of $f$ on $U$ , i.e. $g(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in U$ .

=b_0z^{2n}F(1/z)$$where$$F(z)=1+\frac{b_1}{b_0}z+\cdots+\frac{b_{2n}}{b_0}z^{2n}
=\prod_{k=1}^{2n}(1-\alpha_k z).$$ Then the following concluding sentence is given: Now $F(z)$ will be nonzero for $|z|<1/a$ so each $|\alpha_k|<a$.
  Each $(1-\alpha_kz)$ will have a holomorphic square root on the disc
  $\{z:|z|<1/a\}$. I do not understand fully why such a conclusion can be made. Firstly, why must $F(1/z)$ be used? What is the problem with using $F(z)$ instead? Secondly, why can we say each $(1-\alpha_k z)$ has a holomorphi square root in that disc? Is there some theorem which allows us to make this conclusion?",['complex-analysis']

Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 7 years ago . Improve this question If $x$ is a continuous r.v., with pdf as $f(x)$ and cdf as $F(x)$, then say I take $x=A$, and wish to compare the quantities ($A*f(A)$) with $F(A)$. Since $F(A)=\int_0^Af(x)dx$ doesn't it follow that $F(A)>A*f(A)$? However, I also have this argument: Consider a discrete distribution where $f(x)$ has value 4 in the range 0.95 to 1.00.  The value of $xf(x)$ in this range will be around 4, but the contribution to $F(x)$ is only 0.05*4 = 0.20.  The value of $F(x)$ meanwhile is 1.00.  So $xf(x) > F(x)$. Where am I going wrong?

2284056,"Closure of $(a,b)$ in one-point compactifcation of $\mathbb{Q}$","Take $\mathbb{Q}$ to be the rational numbers with the usual topology induced by the absolute value.
Let $\mathbb{Q}^*=\mathbb{Q} \cup \{ \infty \}$ be the one-point compactification of $\mathbb{Q}$.
Let $a$, $b \in \mathbb{R}$ be any real numbers, $a < b$. What is the closure of the set $(a,b) \cap \mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{Q}^*$? I suspect that the answer is not $[a,b] \cap \mathbb{Q}$.
My reasoning is that the complement of that set, i.e. $\mathbb{Q}^* \setminus ( [a,b] \cap \mathbb{Q})= \{ \infty \} \cup (\mathbb{Q} \setminus [a,b] )$, is not open.
That is because $[a,b]$ is not a compact set in $\mathbb{Q}$. Clearly this is not a proof of my suspicion, but I think it could be expanded to a proof.
However this is very unintuitive, as $[a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ is in fact the closure of $(a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$ in $\mathbb{R}^*$. Is my guess correct?","['general-topology', 'rational-numbers', 'compactification']"
2284106,Function Composition and Expected Value,"I was presented with the question The function $f(x)$ is equal to $x^2$ and the function $\chi(x)$ gives a random real number from 0 to $x$. Which usually has a greater expected value, $(f \circ \chi)(x)$ or $(\chi \circ f)(x)$ For what values of $x$? I am almost entirely unexperienced in the field of probability. My approach to this was first to find the expected value of $\chi(x)$, which I think should be
$$\frac{1}{x}\int_0^x x dx=\frac{1}{2}x$$
meaning that the expected value of $(f \circ \chi)(x)$ should be 
$$f(\frac{1}{2}x)=\frac{1}{4}x^2$$
Then I figured that the expected value of $(\chi \circ f)(x)$ would be
$$\frac{1}{x^2}\int_0^{x^2} x dx=\frac{1}{2}x^2$$
Are my methods correct here? If not, how would I go about doing this?","['means', 'expectation', 'probability', 'random-functions']"
2284134,5 boys and 3 girls are to be arranged such that only one girl has a boy adjacent to her . Find the number such arrangement,Suppose 5 boys and 3 girls are to be arranged  such that only one girl has a boy  adjacent to her . Find the number such arrangement . My work :  I think there are only  such  possible arrangment $2 \times 3!\times 5! $ . If the girls are aren't together then one girl will have two boys adjacent to her .So girls must be to-gather and they should be at the either of the two extreme side of the arrangement of the  boys . There are two possible side that one of the $3$ girls can take . Now the girls can arrange among themselves in $3!$ ways and boys can arrange among themselves in $5!$ ways.So there are about $3!\times 5! $ arrangements when girls are together and are at the left of the $5$-boys . Similarly there are $3!\times 5!$ other cases when girls are to be put on the left . So total cases= $2\times 3! \times 5! $,"['combinations', 'proof-verification', 'probability', 'permutations', 'combinatorics']"

2284205,"Proof: Let $C \subseteq [0,1]$ be uncountable, show that $C \cap [a,1]$ is uncountable for some $a \in (0,1)$","I have a question regarding the following exercise from Stephen Abbott's Understanding Analysis - 2nd edition: Let $C \subseteq [0,1]$ be uncountable. Show that exists $a \in (0,1)$ such that $C \cap [a,1] $ is uncountable Actually, someone already asked this question here . However I came up with a slightly different proof and I would appreciate some comments on the correctness. First we define $ S:= \{ a \in (0,1] \, | \, s.t. \ C \ \cap [a,1] \  \text{is countable}   \}$. Clearly $S$ is bounded from below by 0 and non-empty as $1$ is always an element of S. Thus it follows from the Axiom of Completness that $ s := \inf(S)$ exists. It also holds that $ s > 0 $, as $s = 0$ would implicate that $C \cap (0,1]$ is countable, however then $ C = \{0 \} \ \cup \ (C \ \cap \ (0,1] ) $  would be countable as an union of two countable sets, which contradicts our initial assumption.
It follows that for $a:= s/2 $ it holds that $1 > a > 0$  and also $C \ \cap [a,1]$ is uncountable as $s > a$ and thus $a \notin S $. Thanks for your feedback,

2284250,Easy way to find out limit of $a_n = \left (1+\frac{1}{n^2} \right )^n$ for $n \rightarrow \infty$?,What's an easy way to find out the limit of $a_n = \left (1+\frac{1}{n^2} \right )^n$ for $n \rightarrow \infty$?

And Bernoulli's inequality only shows $\left (1+\frac{1}{n^2} \right )^n \geq 1 + n \cdot \frac{1}{n^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{n} \geq 1$ which doesn't seem to help as well.,"['sequences-and-series', 'limits']"

2284356,what numbers are integrally represented by this quartic polynomial (norm form),"My last question on this was a bit of a dud. I would, at least, like confirmation that the polynomial $f$ below does, in fact, integrally represent all primes $p \equiv 1 \pmod 5,$ along with all squared primes $q^2$ when prime $q \equiv 4 \pmod 5.$ It is easy to show that the polynomial represents the product of any two numbers it represents. It is not hard to show that, for any represented number, we can adjust the quadruple $(w,x,y,z)$ so that $w,x,y,z \geq 0.$ If possible, confirm that all represented numbers (with $\gcd(w,x,y,z) = 1$  ) are the product of such primes (including $5$ itself) and such squares. Let me find some jpegs... In this $f$ I am going to demand $\gcd(w,x,y,z) = 1.$

2284406,$\pi$ as an Infinite Series using Taylor Expansion on Equation of a Circle,"If we write $\ y = \sqrt{r^2-x^2}$ for the equation of a circle in Cartesian coordinates with radius $r$ and perform a Taylor expansion on this equation, then integrate term by term from $0$ to $r$, giving the area of a quarter of a circle. Then, isolating $\pi$, all $r$ terms conveniently drop out and the expression becomes:
$$\pi = 4 - \frac{4}{3!}- \frac{12}{5!}- \frac{180}{7!}- \frac{6300}{9!}- \frac{396900}{11!} - ...$$ This can be written as: $$\ \pi = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{-4[(2n-3)!!]^2}{(2n-3)(2n-1)!}$$ I attach here a WolframAlpha Link of this evaluated to 2700 terms.

I was wondering if any symmetric matrix with positive eigenvalues could be expressed as the product of some matrix and its transpose? Note: It's obvious that if the eigenvalues are not all positive then this cannot be the case, as $A^TA$ and $AA^T$ both have to be positive semidefinite.

2284440,Show that the determinant of any outer product is 0,"I want to show that for any two vectors $a, b \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and given $M = ab^T$, $\det(M) = 0$. I've come up with the following proof, but I'm not sure if it's sufficient; could someone double-check it? Given $M = ab^T$, the system of equations $Mx = 0$ is equivalent to $ab^Tx = a(b \cdot x) = 0$. Then there exists a nonzero vector $x$ that is orthogonal to $b$, and so $a(b \cdot x) = a \times 0 = 0$. The existence of a nonzero $x$ such that $Mx = 0$ implies that $M$ is singular, and therefore $\det(M) = 0$. Is this proof correct? More interestingly, is there a much simpler proof that I'm missing?","['linear-algebra', 'determinant']"

Is there any solution which doesn't use algebraic topology? I solved this problem by using Kunneth formula and there is another solution using homotopy group $\pi_{2}$. However, it seems that there might be an elementary proof that only uses general topology. If such space exists, we can prove that $X$ is connected and compact. Also, we can show that $X$ is simply-connected. Anything else? Thanks in advance.","['algebraic-topology', 'general-topology']"
