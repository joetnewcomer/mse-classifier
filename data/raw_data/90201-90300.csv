1212418,Showing $\int_E f=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_E f_n$ for all measurable $E$,"The following is an exercise from Carothers' Real Analysis : Suppose $f$ and $f_n$ are nonnegative, measurable functions, that $f=\lim_{n\to\infty} f_n$ and that $\int f=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int f_n<\infty$. Prove that $\int_E f=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_E f_n$ for any measurable set $E$. (Hint: Consider both $\int_E f$ and $\int_{E^c} f$.) Give an example showing that this need not be true if $\int f=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int f_n=\infty$. Attempt: Using Fatou's Lemma, I can get that $$\int_E f=\int_E \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n=\int_E\liminf_{n\to\infty} f_n\leq \liminf_{n\to\infty}\int_E f_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_E f_n$$ However, I'm doubtful that this is correct since the hint in the book said to consider both $E^c$ and $E$. I know that if $E$ is measurable, then its complement is measurable as well. A small push in the right direction would be appreciated.

1212427,$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac{\log(p_{n+1})}{\log(p_n)}\right)^n = C?$,"There is a conjecture (which is weaker) related conjecture to Firoozbakht's conjecture (see OEIS A182514 Commments) which states (and define $L_n$): $$L_n := \left(\frac{\log(p_{n+1})}{\log(p_n)}\right)^n < e,$$ where $p_n$ is the $n$-th prime. This implies there might be constant, $C$, because as the RHS is constant as $n\to\infty$, and every thing on the LHS increasing without bound. So does $C$ exist and what value does it approach? While I know that the $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac{\log(p_{n+1})}{\log(p_n)}\right) = 1$, and clearly $\left(\frac{\log(p_{n+1})}{\log(p_n)}\right) > 1$, it is the power, $n$, that is a curve-ball for me.

\begin{vmatrix}
-\lambda & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & -\lambda  & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & -\lambda & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & -\lambda

$$v_1 = \begin{pmatrix}1\\1\\1\\1\end{pmatrix}$$ For eigenvalue $\lambda_2 = -2$, I get eigenvector of:
$$v_2 = \begin{pmatrix}-1\\1\\-1\\1\end{pmatrix}$$ This seems to check out. If I multiply $C v_1$, I get $\lambda_1 v_1 = 2 v_1$. If I multiply $C v_2$, I get $\lambda_2 v_2 = -2 v_2$. My professor disagrees. He states that the eigenvalues should be 2, 2, 0, 0, and that the two corresponding eigenvectors associated with eigenvalue of 2 are: $$v_1' = \begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\\1\end{pmatrix} \qquad v_2' = \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}$$ My professor further states: Try multiplying the vectors $v'_1$ and $v'_2$ by $\mathbf C$ and you’ll see that, indeed, they are both eigenvectors with eigenvalue 2. That still seems wrong to me. I did as he suggested and $$ C v'_1 = \begin{pmatrix}2\\0\\2\\0\end{pmatrix} \neq 2 v'_1 \qquad C v'_2 = \begin{pmatrix}0\\2\\0\\2\end{pmatrix}$$ I believe there is a subtle mistake here. $C v'_1 = 2 v'_2$ and $C v'_2 = 2 v'_1$ but that is irrelevant, correct?

1212941,Fibres of the base change of a scheme,"I am trying to gain a better understanding of the notion of fibre products of schemes. Two major applications that I've began to study are: 1) Making an $S$-scheme $X$ into an $S'$-scheme via a morphism $S' \rightarrow S$, and 2) Obtaining the notion of a fibre: For a point $p$ of $S$, the canonical morphism $\operatorname{Spec}k(p) \rightarrow S$ induces the scheme $\operatorname{Spec}k(p) \times_S X$ over $\operatorname{Spec}k(p)$ whose underlying topological space coincides with the fibre over $p$. What is the effect of base change on the fibres? Say, I have $f: X \rightarrow S$, $g: S' \rightarrow S$ and $p \in S, p' \in g^{-1}(p)$. Denote $X' = X \times_S S'$ and let $f': X' \rightarrow S'$ be the base change of $f$. Then there are two fibres $\begin{align}
f^{-1}(p) &= \operatorname{Spec}k(p) \times_S X\\
f'^{-1}(p') &= \operatorname{Spec}k(p') \times_{S'} X' \end{align}$ and there is an induced morphism $\operatorname{Spec}k(p') \times_{S'} X'  \rightarrow \operatorname{Spec}k(p) \times_S X$ by the universal property of the fibre product. Will this be an isomorphism in general, or at least in certain cases? I am mostly curious about what happens if $g$ is a nonconstant map of smooth curves over $k$.",['algebraic-geometry']

1212972,Elementary Combinatorial Proofs using group action,"In trying to prove that the number of spanning trees in $K_5$ is $125$ I adopted the following method: Let $S$ be the set of all such spanning trees and let $S_5$ act in a natural way on $S$. Now exactly three nonisomorphic spanning trees $T_1=K_{1,4},T_2=P_5,T_3=\text{chair}$ are possible with $\text{Stab}(T_i)=\text{Aut}(T_i)$. As $|\text{Orbit}(T_i)|=\frac{|S_5|}{|\text{Stab}(T_i)|}$ and as $S$ is a disjoint union of the three orbits so we have: $$|S|=\frac{5!}{4!}+\frac{5!}{2!}+\frac{5!}{2!}=125.$$ This result can be obtained purely by counting arguments as well, but I find the above proof more satisfying. What are some other elementary counting proofs in combinatorics which can be interpreted in terms of group action? Here is another example of the type of results that I am looking for: The number of ways of choosing $k$ distinct objects out of $n$ where
  the order matters is $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$. Proof: Suppose $G=S_n$ and $X=\cup_{m=1}^n \{(x_1,\ldots,x_m):x_i\ne x_j\text{ for }i\ne j, x_i\in[n]\}$. The function from $G\times X$ to $X$ defined by $\sigma\cdot (x_1,\ldots,x_m)=(\sigma(x_1),\ldots,\sigma(x_m))$ is clearly a group action. Let $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\in X$. Then $\mathcal{O}_x$ is precisely the collection of all $k$-tuples from $[n]$ where each coordinate is different. Our proof will be finished if we show that $|\mathcal{O}_x|=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$. Note that the permutations which fix $x$ and thereby each $x_i$ are exactly those which permute elements other then $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ and such permutations are precisely $(n-k)!$ in number. So $|G_x|=(n-k)!$. The result now follows by invoking the orbit stabilizer theorem. A similar result $\tbinom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ can be obtained by letting $X$ to be the set of all $k$-subsets of $[n]$.","['graph-theory', 'group-theory', 'combinatorics', 'group-actions']"
1213000,A game may related to graph theory or topology,"Last Sunday, I played a game with a group of people. The game is as follows: A group of people form a circle as shown below: Each person must remember how he/she is linked with his two neighbours. For example, A remembers that his left hand grabs B's right hand and his right hand grabs C's left hand. Then a judge separate these people and make their position random. After this, every person stand still and grab the hand of his original neighbours, in the way as before. (In the example above, A must still take B's right hand by his left hand, and C's left hand by his right hand.) Now the people are in a twist. The purpose is to return to a circle as fast as possible without ever breaking up the hands. One can step over arms and hands can go over heads. The restored circle does not require that all the people must still face to the center of the circle. There is a debate to whether a solution always exists. I hope you can understand my (poor) description and give me a rather rigorous (but understandable) proof. I am so interested in this problem.

1213066,What does it mean when $\sigma$ is discriminatory?,"I am reviewing this paper on the approximating power of neural networks and I came across a definition that I could not quite understand. The definition reads: where $I_n$ is the $n$-dimensional unit hypercube and $M(I_n)$ is the space of finite, signed, regular Borel measures on $I_n$. The only thing that I could get from this definition which again does not seem plausible enough is: since whenever the integral is $0$ it must imply that the measure $\mu$ is $0$, then $\sigma$ is non-zero. I am not sure if this right though. I literally could not find any other literature or similar definitions on this and I've looked in a number of textbooks such as Kreyzig, Rudin and Stein & Shakarchi. Any insight/help? EDIT So, a function $f$ is discriminatory if the condition in the above definition is sufficient for $\mu \in M(I_n)$ to be $0$. In a sense, if the condition is met then $f$ ""discriminates"" or ""reveals"" the notion that the measure $\mu$ is $0$ over all of $I_n$. Remark Hence meaning that the set $I_n$ on which $\mu$ is defined on is $\mu$-negligible. I am not entirely sure if my last remark is correct though since $\mu$ is signed and not necessarily positive. I have read that the stronger form for signed measures would in this case be if every measurable subset A of $I_n$ satisfies $\mu(A) = 0$. I do not think however that my remark is even near informative enough and this definition probably requires further justice.","['lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory']"

Let $G:\mathbb{R^3} \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by the equation $$G(x,y,z)=F(x+2y+3z-1, x^3+y^2-z^2).$$ (a) Note that $G(-2,3,-1)=F(0,0)=0$. Show that one can solve the equation $G(x,y,z)=0$ for $z$, say $z=g(x,y)$, for $(x,y)$ in a neighborhood $B$ of $(-2,3)$, such that $g(-2,3)=-1$. (b) Find $Dg(-2,3)$. (c) If $D_1D_1F=3$ and $D_1D_2F=-1$ and $D_2D_2F=5$ at $(0,0)$, find $D_2D_1g(-2,3)$. I've worked through (a) and (b). This is my answer. Define $h(x,y,z)=(x+2y+3z-1,x^3+y^2-z^2)$, then $G=F\circ h$, so by Chain Rule, $DG=DF(h(x,y,z))Dh(x,y,z)$. Since $Dh=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
3x^2 & 2y & -2z \\
\end{bmatrix},$
then
$DG(-2,3,-1)=\begin{bmatrix}
38 & 22 & 12 \\
\end{bmatrix}$. So $\frac{\partial G}{\partial z}(-2,3,-1)=12\neq 0$.
Hence by the Implicit Function Theorem, we can find such $g$ and $B$ in (a). Also, we've got $Dg(-2,3)=\frac{-1}{12}\begin{bmatrix}
38 & 22 \\
\end{bmatrix}$ from the result obtained above. However, I'm lost on how to approach (c). I'm not sure how I'm supposed to find the value. I would appreciate some help on this problem.","['analysis', 'vector-analysis', 'multivariable-calculus']"

1213366,Lower bound on convexity radius in terms of injectivity radius (without using curvature),"Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold, and let $C$ be a subset of $M$. We will say $C$ is convex if for any points $p,q \in C$, there exists a unique normal minimal geodesic $\gamma$ joining $p$ and $q$, such that $\gamma \subset C$. We will define: the convexity radius of $M$ by ""the infimum of positive numbers $r$ such that the geodesic open ball $B(p,r)$ is convex for every $p \in M$"", the injectivity radius at $p$  by ""the infimum of the cut values of the various geodesics emanting from $p$"" (i.e. the radius of the largest geodesic ball on which $\exp$ is a diffeomorphism) the injectivity radius of $M$ as $\inf_{p \in M} \{\textrm{injectivity radius of } $p$\}$ (these definitions are taken from Berger's A Panoramic View of Riemannian Geometry , but appear to be standard across the field). Now, we have the following theorem, bounding the convexity radius from below in terms of the injectivity radius, and sectional curvature $K$: THM : If $M$ is compact, $\textrm{Convexity Radius}(M) \geq \min \{ \frac12  \pi/\sqrt{ \sup K}, \frac 12 \textrm{Injectivity Radius}(M)\}$ Where $\frac12 \sup \pi/\sqrt K$ is replaced by $\infty$ if $\sup K \leq 0$. (and if $M$ is not compact, a local version of the statement still holds) and Berger additionally notes: ""Apparently there is no example in the literature with the convexity radius smaller than half of the injectivity radius. A natural conjecture is that such a bound should not be too difficult to prove."" My question is essentially about a weaker form of this conjecture; in particular, if we can assume the injectivity radius is maximal, can we conclude something similar of the convexity radius (and without considering the curvature)? Or more precisely: Q : If the manifold is simple (meaning any two points are connected by a unique minimizing geodesic; equivalently the exponential is a global diffeomorphism at any point), is the geodesic ball $B(r,p)$ convex for any $r> 0$?","['partial-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'reference-request']"

a(0,~ m,~ j) &= m\cdot a(0,~ m-1,~ j-1)+(j-mN)\cdot a(0,~ m-1,~ j) \quad \text{  for } 1 \le j < m \\

\\
a(0,~ m,~ m) &= m\cdot a(0,~ m-1,~ m-1) \\
\end{align}$$ There are a few explicit closed forms within this recurrence, such as $$\begin{align}
a(0,~ m,~ 0) &= (-1)^m ~ m! ~ N^m \\
a(0,~ m,~ 1) &= \sum_{n=0}^{m-2}\sum_{k=0}^n s(m,m-k)(-N)^k\\

a(m-1,~ m,~ m) &= (1+2+\dots+m) \\
a(m,~ m,~ m) &= 1
\end{align}$$ Note above that $s(m,k)$ are Stirling numbers of the first kind. Something that is true is the degree of the polynomial $a(k,m,j)=m-j$.  The last restriction is if the above conditions of $0\le k\le j\le m$ is not met, then $a(k,m,j)=0$. Using this recursively, I can generate polynomials.  Below is an example.  I want to solve this and find an explicit formula, but the problem is, I've never solved multivariate recurrences.  I first tried to do this simply by taking the recurrence deeper and deeper by substitution, but it gets messy very quickly. First, is this recurrence even solvable?  Is there an explicit form or are there too many variables to give me a unique expression? There is so much here and it seems overwhelming.  Can anyone help me make this managable? (if possible?) EDIT:  As for the motivation and where this is coming from, 
$$B(x)=\frac{x^N/N!}{e^x-1-x-...-\frac{x^{N-1}}{(N-1)!}}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty B_n(N)\frac{x^n}{n!}$$
satisfies the following differential equation
$$-NB(x)^2=(x-N)B(x)+xB'(x)$$
Taking the derivative on both sides, rewriting and substituting yields the similar higher order differential equation
$$2N^2B(x)^3=[2N^2+(1-4N)x+2x^2]B(x)+[(1-3N)x+3x^2]B'(x)+x^2B''(x)$$
You can use that generating techniques to find higher order differential equations for $B(x)^n$.  Notice that in front of each derivative of $B$ is a polynomial in $x$ and each term in the polynomial of $x$ is comprised of polynomials in $N$ (originally in the post as $x$, I've changed them throughout to $N$ now, sorry for the confusion).  It is these terms I'm trying to find a closed form for.  For example, 
$$a(0,2,0)=2N^2, ~ a(0,2,1)=1-4N, ~ a(0,2,2)=2$$
$$a(1,2,0)=0, ~ a(1,2,1)=1-3N, ~ a(1,2,2)=3$$
$$a(2,2,0)=0, ~ a(2,2,1)=0, ~ a(2,2,2)=1$$
Notice that 
$$a(0,2,1)=2\cdot a(0,1,0)+(1-2N)\cdot a(0,1,1)=2(-N)+(1-2N)=1-4N$$ There are a lot of specific rules for particular $a(k,m,j)$. This makes me somewhat positive that a closed form exists... EDIT 2: I added two explicit forms above involving unsigned Stirling Numbers of the first kind.

1213632,A question about stereographic projection of a plane onto a sphere,"I am reading a paper by Christine Bernardi, available here http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0726068 , my question relates to page 1237, which I shall elaborate on: In this part we have the unit sphere (in $\Bbb R^3$), and a regular tetrahedron $T$ inscribed in the sphere. The paper states that if we let $\omega_j$ be the faces of $T$, then the six planes containing
an edge of $T$ and the origin divide the unit sphere F into four equal parts, $\Gamma_j$. The paper then reads that each $\Gamma_j$ is the stereographic projection of $\omega_j$, but my question is how one defines the stereographic projection of a face (i.e. a plane) onto a sphere, since to my knowledge, one would project a sphere onto a plane. Thanks in advance for any help! As an addendum I believe I have figured out what is meant by this type of projection though I welcome any comments or criticisms, I believe you consider the face $\omega_j$, and at each point $x\in\omega_j$ you consider the inscribed sphere with its (relative) north pole at $x$ and south pole lying on the unit sphere, you then project the point onto the plane tangent to the south pole of this sphere (which lies on the original unit sphere), taking all projections of all points $x\in\omega_j$  we get $\Gamma_j$.","['differential-geometry', 'stereographic-projections']"

1213903,Valid proof of Young's inequality?,"Part of an exercise to prove Holder's inequality in Rudin involves proving Young's Inequality... That is, given $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q} = 1$, prove 
$$ab \leqslant \frac{a^p}{p} + \frac{b^q}{q}.$$ Here's my attempt at a proof: Let $$f(x) = \frac{x^p}{p} + \frac{b^q}{q} -bx$$ then, $$f'(x) = x^{p-1} -b$$ so that $f$ attains a minimum at $$x=b^{\frac{1}{p-1}}.$$ Since $\frac{p}{p-1} = q$, this is equivalent to saying that $f$ attains its minimum when $x^p = b^q$. Now, we need show that $$f(b^{\frac{1}{p-1}}) = 0.$$ We compute $$
\begin{align}
f(b^{\frac{1}{p-1}}) &= \frac{(b^{\frac{1}{p-1}})^p}{p} + \frac{b^q}{q} - bb^{\frac{1}{p-1}} \\
&= \frac{b^q}{p} + \frac{b^q}{q} - b^{\frac{1}{p-1} +1} \\
&= \frac{b^q(p+q)}{pq} - b^{\frac{1}{p-1} +1} \\
&= b^q - b^{\frac{1}{p-1} +1} \\
&= b^q - b^q \\
& = 0
\end{align}$$
where $b^{\frac{1}{p-1} +1} = b^q$ since $$\frac{1}{p-1} +1 = \frac{1}{p-1} +\frac{p-1}{p-1} = \frac{p}{p-1} = q.$$ Thus, $f(x) = 0$ only when $x^p = b^q$. This is the global minimum of $f$ since $f^{''} \geq 0$ and analysis of concavity. Therefore, if $x > b^{\frac{1}{p-1}}$, $f(x) > 0$. That is, if $x^p > b^q$, the inequality holds. A similar analysis for $g(y) = \frac{a^p}{p} + \frac{y^q}{q} -ay$ shows that $g(y) > 0$ if $y^q > a^p$. Combining these two statements yields that, if $a^p \neq b^q$, the inequality holds, so we're done. Is this a valid proof?

If

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \left( a_n + b_n \right) =
\left( \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \right) +
\left( \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n \right) .
$$
$\textit{Proof.}$
Let $\varepsilon > 0$.
It remains to prove that
there is $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that,
for every natural number $m > N$,
we have
$$
\left|
  a_m + b_m -
  \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \right) -
  \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n \right)
\right| < \varepsilon .
$$
By assumption,
there is $N_a \in \mathbb{N}$ such that,
for every natural number $m > N_a$,
we have
$$
\left|
  a_m -
  \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \right)
\right| < \varepsilon / 2 .
$$
Analogously,
there is $N_b \in \mathbb{N}$ such that,
for every natural number $m > N_b$,
we have
$$
\left|
  b_m -
  \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n \right)
\right| < \varepsilon / 2 .
$$
We choose $N := \max(N_a, N_b)$.
Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m > N$.
Obviously, for this $m$, each of the above two inequalities holds.
Thus, we may add the inequalities. Doing so, we obtain
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\varepsilon = \varepsilon / 2 + \varepsilon / 2
& >
\left|
  a_m -
  \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \right)

\right| &\quad& \text{by subadditivity of abs. val.} \\

  \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \right) -
  \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n \right)

Hence, by transitivity,
\begin{equation*}
\varepsilon >

  a_m + b_m -

  \left( \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n \right)

1214385,Two different answers for combinatorics question - which is correct?,"At my wife's insistence, we have twelve food and water bowls for our three cats—nine circular (i.e. with circular cross-section) and three elliptical. I've just washed them all, and I'm wondering in how many ways I can put them down for the cats. Here are the rules I've (informally) developed: There are two water bowls and three food bowls for the three cats. The three elliptical bowls are a set; they go down together. The elliptical bowls are too shallow to be used for water bowls; they're only ever used as food bowls. Thus, when I'm putting down food and water bowls, the two water bowls are always selected from the circular bowls. The three food bowls are either all circular or all elliptical; never a mix. I took two approaches to solving the problem and got two very different answers; I'm not sure which, if either, is correct. Approach 1: First, take out the two water bowls (which must be circular); there are $\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways to do that. Then, take out the three food bowls. For these, I can choose either three of the remaining seven circular bowls ($\binom{7}{3} = 35$ possibilities) or the three elliptical bowls ($1$ possibility). Thus, the total number of combinations of water and food bowls is $36 * (35 + 1) = 1296$. Approach 2: For the five bowls, I can either take out five of my nine circular bowls (two for water, three for food), or two of the nine circular bowls (for water) and the three elliptical bowls (for food). The first possibility can be done in $\binom{9}{5} = 126$ ways, and the second in $\binom{9}{2} \cdot  1 = 36$ ways; thus the total number of combinations is $126 + 36 = 162$. Which, if either, of these is correct, and why is the other (or why are both) wrong?",['combinatorics']
1214387,An improper triple integral where the domain is a cube,"I am trying to find the value of the following integral: $$\iiint\limits_D {{x^2} + {y^2}dV}$$ where the domain $D$ is a cube $0 \leqslant x,y,z \leqslant 1$. Solution (attempt 1) The first thing I did was to rewrite the domain, adding the upper/lower bounds (infinity in my case), so the domain becomes $$0 \leqslant x < \infty , \quad -\infty  < y < \infty ,\quad -\infty  < z \leqslant 1$$ This is good since it states clear upper/lower bounds for each iteration. $$\iiint\limits_D {{x^2} + {y^2}dV} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{R \to \infty } \int\limits_{ - R}^R {{y^2}dy\int\limits_0^R {{x^2}dx\int\limits_0^1 {dz = } } } \\ =\mathop {\lim }\limits_{R \to \infty } \left[ {\frac{{{y^3}}}{3}} \right]_{ - R}^R\left[ {\frac{{{x^3}}}{3}} \right]_0^R\left[ z \right]_0^1 = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{R \to \infty } \frac{{2{R^6}}}{9}(1 - R)$$ Solution (attempt 2) I observed at least one symmetry in the integral with respect to $y$. In other words, it can be rewritten as: $$\iiint\limits_D {{x^2} + {y^2}dV} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{R \to \infty } \int\limits_{ - R}^R {{y^2}dy\int\limits_0^R {{x^2}dx\int\limits_0^1 {dz = } } } \mathop {\lim }\limits_{R \to \infty } 2\int\limits_0^R {{y^2}dy\int\limits_0^R {{x^2}dx\int\limits_0^1 {dz =\\= \mathop {\lim }\limits_{R \to \infty } } } } 2\left[ {\frac{{{y^3}}}{3}} \right]_0^R\left[ {\frac{{{x^3}}}{3}} \right]_0^R\left[ z \right]_0^1 = \frac{{2{R^6}}}{9}$$ The strange observation It's strange that both values support the idea that the hypervolume is infinitely big, but when I look in the key, it's simply $\frac{2}{3}$.

1214435,If $\alpha = \prod_{i = 1}^{\infty} a_i \in \bar{\Bbb{Q}}$ can we write $\alpha = a_n \alpha'$ with $\text{den}(\alpha) = \text{den}(\alpha')$?,"If $\alpha$ is any algebraic number, there is an integer $d > 0$ such that $d\alpha$ is an algebraic integer, and the minimum such $d$ is called the denominator of $\alpha$, written $\text{den}(\alpha)$. Now consider a sequence of algebraic integers $(a_i)$ such that
$$
\alpha = \prod_{i = 1}^{\infty} a_i
$$
is algebraic. I'm wondering if there are some nice sufficient conditions for the existence of an index $n$ such that $\alpha = a_n \alpha'$ with $\text{den}(\alpha) = \text{den}(\alpha')$. It would also be nice to know if we can choose $n$ such that $a_n \mathcal{O}_K$ and $\text{den}(\alpha) \mathcal{O}_K$ are coprime, where $K = \mathbb{Q}(a_n)$. I tried to find some examples of $\alpha$ and play with those, but so far I came up short. I can see that the answer to both questions is positive for
$$
n = n^{\sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} 1/2^i} = \prod_{i = 1}^{\infty} n^{1/2^i}
$$
with $n$ any fixed positive integer, but I couldn't even extend this to
$$
\alpha = \prod_{i = 1}^{\infty} n^{1/m_i}
$$
for any given sequence of integers $(m_i)$ such that the product converges. In general I only know that if $\alpha$ is irrational and algebraic, then $\sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} 1/m_i$ cannot be in $\overline{\Bbb{Q}} \setminus \Bbb{Q}$ (as a consequence of Baker's theorem ). Motivation: Such a factorisation would imply a neat proof that some numbers, like $\prod_{k=2}^{\infty} k^{1/2^{k-1}}$ , are transcendental.","['number-theory', 'infinite-product']"

1214605,Finding critical values of a function on an embedded surface,"Prior to the problem, we have already shown that $\Sigma=\{x_1x_2^2+x_2x_3^2+x_3x_1^2=1\}\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ is an embedded hypersurface and that the function $f:\Sigma\rightarrow\mathbb{R};(x_1,x_2,x_3)\mapsto x_1$ is surjective. The problem asks to find the critical values of $f$. If we had a ""nice"" global coordinate chart on $\Sigma$, which is 2-dimensional, we could calculate the differential of $f$ in these coordinates and find out where it vanishes. The canonical coordinates inherited from $\mathbb{R}^3$ are however 3-dimensional and not appropriate for this purpose. Therefore, we tried to use the following trick: Define $F:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R};F(x_1,x_2,x_3)=x_1x_2^2+x_2x_3^2+x_3x_1^2$ and $E_a:=\{(a,x_2,x_3)\in\mathbb{R}^3|x_2,x_3\in\mathbb{R}\}$ for some $a\in\mathbb{R}$. We claim that the critical points of $f$ are exactly the critical points of $F|_{E_a}$ which also lie in $\Sigma$. Assuming this claim to be true, we calculated
\begin{equation}
d(F|_{E_a})_{(x_2,x_3)}=\begin{pmatrix}x_3^2+2ax_2&&2x_2x_3+a^2\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
If $a=0$, then $d(F|_{E_a})_{(x_2,x_3)}=0$ implies $x_3=0$ and $x_2$ is arbitrary, but this triple does not lie on $\Sigma$.
If $a\neq 0$, $d(F|_{E_a})_{(x_2,x_3)}=0$ implies $x_3=a$ and $x_2=-a/2$, then $(a,-a/2,a)\in\Sigma$ implies $a=\sqrt[3]4$. Hence, $\sqrt[3]4$ is the only critical value of $f$. The question is: Is the claim correct? If yes, how can we prove it? If no, how can we solve the original problem?","['differential-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds']"
1214630,Intuitive meaning of immersions,"I have a hard time understanding the concept of immersions. In my course, it was only introduced by the immersion theorem wich says: Let $f: U \subset \mathbb{R}^{m} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ be $C^{1}$ on an open subset $U \subset \mathbb{R}^{m}$. Let $a \in U$ rank$(Df_{(a)}) = m$ then there exists a neigbourhood $V$ of $f(a)$ and a diffeomorphism: $\psi: V \rightarrow \psi(V)$ such that:
$$\psi ( f(x_{1},...,x_{n})) = (x_{1},...,x_{n},\underbrace{0,...0}_\text{n-m})$$ For $x$ close enough to $a$. The way I see it is that a 'surface' in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ can be gradually deformed to a flat surface in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
Is this a reasonable way of thinking of immersions?
If so, consider:
$$f:\bar{B}_{1}(0) \subset \mathbb{R}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}:(x,y) \rightarrow (x,y,\sqrt{1-x^{2}-y^{2}})$$
wich maps $\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}| x^{2}+-y^{2} \leq 1 \}$ to the upper halve of a sphere in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.
The differential of $f$ in $(0,0)$ is:
$$Df_{0} = \begin{pmatrix}
   1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1  \\
  0 & 0
 \end{pmatrix}$$
So the immersiontheorem says that in a neighbourhood of the 'north pole' of the upper sphere the surface can be flattened by a function $\psi$.
Consider now the function: $$g:\mathbb{R}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}: (\theta,\phi) \rightarrow (\sin\theta  \cos \phi,\sin\theta  \sin \phi, \cos \theta)$$
Wich also represents a sphere. (not injective).
The differential in $(0,\phi)$ is now:
$$Dg_{0} = \begin{pmatrix}
   \cos \phi &  0\\
  \sin \phi & 0  \\
  0 & 0
 \end{pmatrix}$$ In this case rank$\left (Dg_{(0,\phi)} \right)<2$ so the immersion theorem doesn't apply.
My feeling is that $g$ can't be flattened near $(0,\phi)$ because the immersion theorem doesn't say it can be done. Is this true (I'm aware of the immersion theorem not being if and only if)? and why is it? Because the surface of $g$ and $f$ are the same near those points. Also: What does immersions make important? Bear in mind that I haven't learned anything of manifolds.
I looked at another question , but I don't have enough knowledge to understand it.","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
