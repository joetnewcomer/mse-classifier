1290467,Proving that the free group on two generators is the coproduct $\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$ in $\textbf{Grp}$,"I want to show that the free group on two elements $F(\{x,y\})$ is the coproduct $\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$ in $\textbf{Grp}$. The idea is to use the universal property of free groups to prove that $F(\{x,y\})$ satisfies the universal property of coproducts in  $\textbf{Grp}$. Below is my attempt to prove this. Is this correct? and also I am having trouble extending this result to the free group on $n$ elements. Any help/comments will be appreciated. Thanks Let $G$ be any group. Define $\gamma:\{x,y\}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ to be the set map which send $x$ to the generator $1$ and $y$ to the identity. For the means of set up, let $J:\{x,y\}\rightarrow F(\{x,y\})$ be the set map native to the free group. Next denote $\iota:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow F(\{x,y\})$ to be the inclusion map, which sends $1$ to the generator $x$. Now consider what we've established thus far Now suppose that we have a group homomorphism $f:\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow G$, then $f\circ \gamma$ is a set map from $\{x,y\}$ and thus by the universal property of free groups there exists a unique group homomorphism $\phi:F(\{x,y\})\rightarrow G$ such that commutes. Now to show that $F(\{x,y\})$ is the coproduct $\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$ in $\textbf{Grp}$, we must show that $f=\phi\circ\iota$, that is the following diagram commutes I claim that indeed it does. From the commutativity of the second diagram, we have that $f\circ\gamma=\phi\circ j$. It follows that 
$$f\circ\gamma(x)=f(1)=\phi(x)=\phi\circ j(x) \text{ and } f\circ\phi(y)=f(0)=\phi(y)=\phi\circ j(y)=e_G $$ Notice that $\phi\circ\iota(1)=\phi(x)=f(1)$, which shows that the homomorphism $\phi\circ\iota$ and $f$ agree for the generator of $\mathbb{Z}$ and so $\phi\circ\iota=f$  The commutativity of the third diagram is confirmed, proving that $F(\{x,y\})$ is the coproduct $\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$ (we already have existence $\phi$ from the universal property of free groups, but not the uniqueness in this scenario?).","['free-groups', 'group-theory', 'universal-property', 'category-theory']"

1290516,A supposed to be easy calculus problem,"Find the values of $m$ if the line $y=mx+2$ is a tangent to the curve $x^2-2y^2=1$.

We take the positive one for demonstration $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{2}x(\frac{1}{2}x^2-\frac{1}{2})^{-\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{x}{2\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^2-\frac{1}{2}}}$ $\implies(1-2m^2)x^2=-2m^2$ Since the tangent touches the curve, we can make $x^2-2(mx+2)^2=1$, we then get $(1-2m^2)x^2=9+8mx$ $\implies(1-2m^2)x^2=-2m^2$ and $(1-2m^2)x^2=9+8mx$ are two equations with two unknowns, then we should be able to find the values of $m$, but I couldn't find any easy way to solve those 2 simultaneous equations.

1290543,Direction of Study Suggestion,"I'm not sure if this belongs in stats or here, or why stats would be considered different to math. During my self-study of biochemistry and medicine, I notice that a vast range of published studies are flawed and irreproducible, leading to incorrect hypotheses about many things. In particular it seems the statistics in these studies, notably the P value and confidence intervals, are incorrectly determined and derived. I therefore made the focus of my study temporarily on statistics, but I feel like I'm taking things on faith, such as Chi-squared tests etc, without actually understanding the mathematics behind the formula. I understand the law of large numbers, but not why a sample size needs n=30 or greater for this law to hold in some tests, and why not some other arbitrary number. I appreciate the integral of two points in a normal distribution represents the area, which is a reflection of the probability of an event, but this sort of explanation for more advanced concepts seems to be lacking in the intro courses. I don't like accepting such concepts on faith as seems to be the case with all the online introductory stats courses I can find. I realized then that mathematical statistics is what I'm after, however my mathematical education doesn't extend beyond single variable calculus. I'm prepared to devote some time (6 months or longer) to understanding the foundational math necessary to approach an introduction to statistics from a more rigorous perspective. Would anyone be able to guide me on a study plan necessary that would lead up to probability theory and mathematical statistics, with an end goal of being able to fully understand applied statistics in science and the reasoning behind why certain equations and values of n are used. Ideally I'd like to learn both the mathematical theory, and the application together, perhaps in a package such as R, where I can see the applications of calculus and probability theory to stats. On an unrelated note, why are statistics and mathematics treated as two separate categories? I see stats often applies formulae, but not understanding the application of applied formulae from a mathematical grounding is surely a dangerous thing?",['statistics']
1290546,If $G$ is cyclic then $G/H$ is cyclic?,"If $G$ is cyclic, then $G/H$ is cyclic? The proof I got goes like this: $G$ is cyclic, so $G=<g>$ for some $g\in G$. So any coset in $G/H$ would be of the form $Hg'=Hg^n$ for some $n$. So $Hg$ is an generator of $G/H$. Thus, $G/H$ is cyclic. I might just be confusing myself, but we have only shown that $Hg'$ is in form of $(Hg)^n$. But what if we are missing some $n\in\mathbb{N}$? That is, there is no quotient group of the form $Hg^2$, for example. To make myself a little bit clearer, I think what the above proof has done was showing that $\forall Hg'\in G/H, Hg'\in <Hg>$, thus $G/H \subset <Hg>$.

1290656,A challenge in Prof.Terence Tao's book “Analysis”: Using axiom of specification to define image of a function,"On page 64 (3.4 Images and Inverse Images) of ""Analysis I"" by Terence Tao, it says: Note that the set $f(S)$ ($f$ is a function) is well-defined thanks to the axiom of
  replacement (Axiom 3.6). One can also define $f(S)$ using the axiom of
  specification (Axiom 3.5) instead of replacement, but we leave this as
  a challenge to the reader. right below the definition 3.4.1 (image of sets). (In case any ambiguity caused by incompleteness of pre-knowledge, here is the definition of function given in the same book: Definition 3.3.1 (Functions). Let $X$, $Y$ be sets, and let $P(x,y)$ be a
  property pertaining to an object $x\in X$ and an object $y \in Y$, such that
  for every $x\in X$, there is exactly one $y \in Y$ for which $P(x,y)$ is true
  (this is sometimes known as the vertical line test). Then we define
  the function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ defined by $P$ on the domain $X$ and range $Y$ to be
  the object which, given any input $x\in X$, assigns an output $f(x) \in Y$,
  defined to be the unique object $f(x)$ for which $P(x, f(x))$ is true.
  Thus, for any $x\in X$ and $y \in Y$, $$y=f(x) \Leftrightarrow P(x, y) \textrm{ is true.}$$ ) It is quite obvious for me to see how to define f(S) by using axiom of replacement. However, it bothers me for a bit too long to ""beat off"" the challenge left to the reader. My thinking so far is to somehow construct a property $P(y)\ $that just depends on $y \in Y$ and somehow relates to the domain $S \subseteq X$ (motivation is simply from the format of the set given by axiom of specification $ \lbrace x \in A\mid P(x) \rbrace $). I am not sure but I guess that I did not understand the dependence between the property and the variables very well. That means, I am not sure in which situation the appearance of two variables like ($x$ and $y$) would be allowed to construct a property $P(x)$ or $P(y)$, or even it's not possible to do this. I don't know... So I wish I could get some useful hint or enlightenment. In fact, I would be more excited about the feeling of reading three lines then ""Ah-Ha! That's how it's done"", than a complete solution (though I accept it definitely). By the way, I am a pre-service math teacher right now (not an undergrad student), thus this is not a question for any assignment. I appreciate for any help on this question.

1291151,"Prob 12, Sec. 26, in Munkres' TOPOLOGY, 2nd ed: How to show that the domain of a perfect map is compact if its range is compact?","Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces such that $Y$ is compact, and let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a closed, surjective, and continuous map such that, for each $y \in Y$ , the inverse image $f^{-1} ( \ \{y \} \ )$ is compact. Then how to show that $X$ is compact also? My effort:
(A Mere Write-Up / Presentation Of The Proof Based On The Answers Below) Let $\mathscr{A}$ be an open covering of $X$ . Then, for each $y \in Y$ , the collection $\mathscr{A}$ is a covering of $f^{-1} ( \ \{y\} \ )$ by sets open in $X$ , and since $f^{-1} ( \ \{y\} \ )$ is compact, some finite subcollection of $\mathscr{A}$ , say $\mathscr{A}_y$ , also covers $f^{-1} ( \ \{y\} \ )$ . That is, for each $y \in Y$ , there exists a finite subcollection $\mathscr{A}_y$ of $\mathscr{A}$ such that $$ f^{-1} ( \ \{ y \} \ ) \subset \bigcup_{A \in \mathscr{A}_y } A. \tag{0} $$ For each $y \in Y$ , let us put $$ U_y \colon= \bigcup_{A \in \mathscr{A}_y } A, \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad C_y \colon= X \setminus U_y. \tag{A} $$ Then $U_y$ is an open set in $X$ and $C_y$ is a closed set; moreover we also have $$ f^{-1} ( \ \{ y \} \ ) \subset U_y, \tag{1} $$ and so $$ f^{-1} ( \ \{ y \} \ ) \cap C_y = \emptyset. \tag{2} $$ Now as $f \colon X \to Y$ is a closed map and as $C_y$ is a closed set in $X$ , so the image set $f \left( C_y \right)$ is a closed set in $Y$ . Let us put $$ W_y \colon= Y \setminus f \left( C_y \right). \tag{B} $$ Then $W_y$ is an open set in $Y$ . Now if $x \in f^{-1}\left( W_y \right)$ , then by definition $x \in X$ is such that $f(x) \in W_y$ , which implies that $f(x) \not\in f \left(C_y \right)$ , [Refer to (B) above.] and so $x \not\in C_y$ , which in turn implies that $x \in U_y$ . [Refer to (A) above.] Therefore we have $$ f^{-1} \left( W_y \right) \subset U_y. \tag{3} $$ As $f$ is surjective, so, for each $y \in Y$ , the set $f^{-}( \ \{ y \} \ )$ is non-empty, that is, there exists at least one $x_y \in X$ for which $$ y = f \left( x_y \right). \tag{4} $$ Any such $x_y \in f^{-1}( \ \{ y \} \ )$ of course, and so any such $x_y \not\in C_y$ because of (2) above. So if $y \in f \left( C_y \right)$ , then $y = f(v)$ for some element $v \in C_y$ , which would imply that $v \in f^{-1}( \ \{ y \} \ ) \cap C_y$ , which contradicts (2) above. Thus $y \not\in f \left( C_y \right)$ , and therefore $ y \in W_y$ . [Refer to (B) above.] Thus we have shown that, for each $y \in Y$ , there exists an open set $U_y$ in $X$ and there exists an open set $W_y$ in $Y$ such that $$ y \in W_y \ \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad f^{-1} \left( W_y \right) \subset U_y; \tag{5} $$ [Refer to (3) above.]
  moreover the set $U_y$ is the union of some finite subcollection $\mathscr{A}_y$ of the open covering $\mathscr{A}$ of $X$ . [Refer to (0) above.] In this way, we obtain an open covering of $Y$ , which is as follows: $$ \left\{ \ W_y \ \colon \ y \in Y \ \right\}. $$ And, since $Y$ is compact, this open covering has a finite subcollection that also covers $Y$ ; let $$ \left\{ \ W_{y_1}, \ldots, W_{y_n} \ \right\} $$ be this finite subcollection. Then we have $$ Y = \bigcup_{j=1}^n W_{y_j}. \tag{6} $$ Now we show that $$ X = \bigcup_{j=1}^n U_{y_j}. \tag{7} $$ Let $x$ be an arbitrary point of $X$ . Let $y \colon= f(x)$ . Then $y \in Y$ , and so by (6) above we have $y \in W_{y_k}$ for at least one $k = 1, \ldots, n$ ; that is, $f(x) \in W_{y_k}$ ; this implies that $x \in f^{-1} \left( W_{y_k} \right)$ and hence $x \in U_{y_k}$ , because of (3) above; therefore $$ x \in \bigcup_{j=1}^n U_{y_j}. $$ Thus one of the inclusions required for (7) above to hold holds; the other inclusion follows from the fact that, by our construction of these sets, each set $U_{y_j}$ , for $j = 1, \ldots, n$ , being a union of subsets of $X$ , is itself a subset of $X$ . [Refer to (0) and (1) above.] Finally, as $X$ is a union of the collection $\left\{ \ U_{y_1}, \ldots, U_{y_n} \ \right\}$ consisting of finitely many sets and as each set $U_{y_j}$ , for $j = 1, \ldots, n$ , in this collection is itself a union of a finite subcollection $\mathscr{A}_{y_j}$ of our original open covering $\mathscr{A}$ of $X$ [Refer to (A) above.], so we can conclude that $X$ is eventually the union of the finite subcollection $\mathscr{A}_{y_1} \cup \ldots \cup \mathscr{A}_{y_n}$ of $\mathscr{A}$ . Since $\mathscr{A}$ is an arbitrary open covering of $X$ , we can conclude that $X$ is compact. Is my write-up correct? If so, then is it clear and easy enough to understand? If not, then where are the problems?","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

Now I want to find $k$ because I do know that $k \in Q_8$, and I know that $ij = k$. How can I find $ij$ from these relations. Here is my attempt $i^4=1 \implies i^2i^2 = 1$and since we know that $i^2 =j^2$ so we get that $i^2i^2= 1 \implies i^2j^2 =1$. Now I left multiply by $i^{-1}$ and right multiply by $j^{-1}$ both sides of the equation to end up with $ij = i^{-1}j^{-1}$ and since I know that $i^{-1} = j^{-1}ij$ then I get $ij = j^{-1}ijj^{-1}$ and hence I get $ij = j^{-1}i$. The thing is I never find $k$. Basically my question is the following Given a group presentation ,how come can we find all the elements using the relations in a group presentation even though all the elements may not be listed in the the group presentation. You see there is no $k$ what so ever in the group presentation of $Q_8$. So how come I will be able to find it ?  So should we make life easier, and include all the elements in a group presentation.

I think that using $ X = C([0,1], \mathbb{R}) $ with the supremum norm could be a good idea, since the space isn't seperable(EDIT: It actually is...), so there's nothing quite like $ \mathbb{Q} $ in it. I haven't been able to come up with any concrete examples, though. Also, if one could solve this problem, it'd be natural to ask whether anything changes if we allow the domain to be any measurable space or restrict $ X $ to Banach spaces only. Or is separability of $ X $ sufficient for $ f + g $ to be measurable? I know that's a lot of questions, so I'll appreciate any help given or some references where I could find out more. EDIT: I've found the following paper: http://www.math.ucla.edu/~brh6/DirectIntegral.pdf , which proves at the beginning that the sum of Borel functions valued in a separable Banach space is Borel. Which answers a part of the question, but the main part still remains. EDIT2:  $ C([0,1]) $ was obviously a bad idea, since it's separable by stone-weierstrass theorem. $ B(\mathbb{R}) $ (space of bounded functions) seems like a much better choice for $ X $ and it also higher cardinality than continuum, which might be helpful. I've stumbled upon a result(without proof unfortunately, so I'm not sure about it being correct) claiming that if $ X $ has a dense subset of cardinality $ \le \aleph_1 $, then the sum of Borel functions must also be Borel. I don't know what is the minimal cardinality of a dense subset of $ B(\mathbb{R}) $, but we might need an even bigger space to find a good example for a non-measurable sum of measurable functions.","['normed-spaces', 'measure-theory']"

1291621,Convex boundary of a symplectic manifold,"Given a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$, suppose that $\partial M$ is of contact type. A Liouville field on a symplectic manifold is a vector field $X$ such that $\mathcal L_X \omega = \omega$. We say that $\partial M$ is convex if there is an outward-pointing Liouville field near $\partial M$ (it will usually not be everywhere defined). We say that $\partial M$ is concave if there is an inward-poiting Liouville field. (We say that a hypersurface is of contact type if there is a Liouville vector field defined on a neighborhood of the hypersurface that is transverse to the surface.) An exercise (3.60) in McDuff-Salamon says that any two Liouville vector fields near a hypersurface of contact type must point in the same direction. I can't see why this is true, and what's more, I seem to have found a counterexample. So it's not clear to me that the boundary of a symplectic manifold cannot be both convex and concave. Consider $S^1$ embedded in any symplectic surface. Because this circle is automatically Lagrangian, we know that a neighborhood of it is symplectomorphic to a neighborhood of the zero section in $T^* S^1 \cong S^1 \times (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)$, which has symplectic form $-dt\wedge d\theta$. Given a vector field $X = a\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + b\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}$, the Liouville condition says that $a$ is never zero on the zero section, and that $\left(\frac{\partial a}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial b}{\partial \theta}\right) = 1$. Now pick $X = (\pm 1 + t)\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$. These are two different Liouville vector fields that point in opposite directions. Have I misunderstood the definition of convex boundary? Can the boundary of a higher-dimensional symplectic manifold, whose boundary has contact type, be both concave and convex, or is this a fluke of 2-dimensional symplectic manifolds? If not, what's up with the McDuff-Salamon exercise that says Liouville fields must all point in the same direction?","['differential-geometry', 'symplectic-geometry', 'contact-topology']"
1291630,Does the inverse function theorem hold over $\mathbb{Q}$?,"Let $f:\mathbb{Q}^n \longrightarrow  \mathbb{Q}^n$. We can define what it means for such $f$ to be differentiable: (The differential will be a linear transformation $\mathbb{Q}^n \longrightarrow  \mathbb{Q}^n$) The definition over $\mathbb{R}$ uses the fact it is an ordered field, and the norm structure on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
 We do not have the standard euclidean norm on $\mathbb{Q}^n$ (we cannot take square roots in $\mathbb{Q}$,  and normed spaces are usually defined to be vector spaces over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) but we can use the ""rational"" $1$-norm instead. (This is only one option which works ""intrinsically"", i.e does not require using numbers outside $\mathbb{Q}$, we can use other alternatives of course). We can also say what it means for $f$ to be continuously differentiable: $f=(f_1,\cdots,f_n)$ , $f_i:\mathbb{Q}^n \longrightarrow  \mathbb{Q}$, and the $n$ partial derivatives of $f_i$ are functions $\mathbb{Q}^n \longrightarrow  \mathbb{Q}$, and we have a notion of continuity for these creatures. My question: Assume $f:\mathbb{Q}^n \longrightarrow  \mathbb{Q}^n$ is continuously differentiable, and that $Df(x)$ is invertible for some  $x\in \mathbb{Q}^n$ . Does the conclusion of the inverse function theorem hold? This question can be clearly generalized to arbitrary ordered fields.

$$f(xH) \colon= axH \ \ \ \mbox{ for all } \ xH \in G/H.$$ Then how to show that the map $f$ is a homeomorphism? Here $G/H$ has the quotient topology. My effort: For any two elements $x, y \in G$, we have $xH = yH$ if and only if $x^{-1}y \in H$. So if $xH = yH$, then $x^{-1}y \in H$; so
$$(ax)^{-1}(ay) = (  x^{-1}a^{-1})(ay) = x^{-1}y \in H,$$
showing that $axH = ayH$. So $f$ is well-defined (i.e. single-valued). Now if $f(x) = f(y)$, then $axH = ayH$ and so $(ax)^{-1}(ay) \in H$. But 
$$(ax)^{-1}(ay) = (  x^{-1}a^{-1})(ay) = x^{-1}y. $$
So $x^{-1}y \in H$, which implies that $xH = yH$. Thus $f$ is injective. Now if $yH \in G/H$, then $y \in G$ and so $a^{-1}y \in G$ also; therefore $a^{-1}y H \in G/H$. Moreover, 
$$f(a^{-1}yH) = aa^{-1}yH = yH,$$

1291943,Cartan geometry on manifolds with boundary,"I was reading Sharpe's text on Cartan geometry , and I started to wonder: Does the theory change in any significant way if the base manifold for the Cartan principal bundle is allowed to be a smooth manifold with boundary? Is there any significant interest in general Cartan geometries for manifolds with boundary? I have only worked with smooth manifolds with empty boundary in the past, so I am not very familiar with the nuances of manifolds with boundary. As far as I can tell, there should be no problem extending the theory to the case where the manifold has a non-empty boundary. But perhaps there is something I am missing? With regards to the second question, I know manifolds with boundary are of interest in the case of semi-Riemannian geometry. But I am unfamiliar with other sorts of Cartan geometries (CR, conformal, etc.), so I am not sure whether geometers working on other classes of Cartan geometries are interested in the case of non-empty boundary.","['principal-bundles', 'manifolds-with-boundary', 'manifolds', 'cartan-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
1291958,Correspondence between Ext group and extensions (from Weibel's book),"I am trying to understand the proof of Theorem 3.4.3 from Weibel's book Introduction to homological algebra . The statement is the following. Let $R$ be a ring. Given $R$-modules $A$ and $B$, an extension $\xi$ of $A$ by $B$ is an exact sequence $0\to B\to X\to A\to0$. Then the connecting homomorphism $$\delta:\text{Hom}(A,A)\to\text{Ext}^1(A,B) \tag{1}$$ induces the 1-1 correspondence $\theta$ between equivalence classes of extensions of $A$ by $B$ and $\text{Ext}^1(A,B)$, which is given by $\theta:\xi\mapsto\delta(\text{id}_A)$. In the beginning of the proof it is written the following Fix an exact sequence $0\stackrel{j}\to M\to P\to A\to0$ with $P$ projective. Applying $\text{Hom}(-,B)$ yields an exact sequence $$\text{Hom}(P,B)\to\text{Hom}(M,B)\stackrel{\delta}\to\text{Ext}^1(A, B)\to0.\tag{2}$$ I don't understand why the connecting homomorphism in the sequence (2) is denoted by the same letter as in (1).

1291990,Class of graphs with symmetric random walk,"Let $(V,E)$ be a graph and let $X_n$ be a random walk on the graph. At every step, the walker at $x$ jumps to one of the neighbors drawn uniformly at random among all the vertices $y$ such that there is a directed edge from $x$ to $y$. What is the name of the most general class of graphs such that for any sequence of vertices $x_1$, $x_2$, $\ldots$, $x_n$, the next equality holds, 
$$P(X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, \ldots X_n=x_n \, | \, X_0=x_0) = P(X_1=x_n, X_2=x_{n-1}, \ldots X_n=x_1 \, | \, X_0=x_n)$$
where $P (\, \cdot \, )$ is the probability law of the random walk? I would like to consider graphs with directed edges as well. For example, on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ or on a tree the previous relation holds. If edges are directed such a relation might not hold any more, even if the graph is vertex-transitive.","['probability-theory', 'random-walk', 'graph-theory', 'random', 'probability']"
1291992,Uniform convergence: $\sum \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^n}$,"Consider the series of functions: $$\sum_{n \ge 1} \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^n}$$ Q: Where does this series converge uniformly? We have if $x \neq 0$: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^{n+1}} / \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^n} \right|= \frac{1}{1 + x^2} < 1$$ And if $x = 0$, then the series converges. Therefore, we have pointwise convergence everywhere. For uniform convergence: $$R_n(x) = \sum_{k = n+1}^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^k} \ge \sum_{k = n+1}^{2n} \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^k} \ge \sum_{k = n+1}^{2n} \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^{2n}} = \frac{nx^2}{(1 + x^2)^{2n}}, \ \forall x \in \mathbb {R}$$ Then: $$R_n(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}) \ge \frac{1}{(1 + 1/n)^n)^2} \longrightarrow \frac{1}{e^2} > 0$$ So, we can't have uniform convergence in a neighbourhood of $0$. It seems that for $a > 0$, we don't have uniform convergence on $[a, \infty)$ or $(-\infty, -a]$ because we can make $x$ as large as we desire. But, I'm not sure about this. However, on any compact interval $[a,b]$ with $b < -1$ or $a > 1$, we do have uniform convergence because of normal convergence: $$\sup_{x \in [a,b]} \left( \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^2)^n} \right) \le \frac{b^2}{a^{2n}}$$ Can someone help me find all the sets on which we have uniform convergence?

I know that the number of digits in a number is $\lfloor \log_{10} n\rfloor +1$ and that the Harmonic numbers are given by $\gamma+\psi_0 (n+1)$, where $\psi_0 (x)=\frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)}$ but I don't see how to find the number of digits in the denominator of $\psi_0(n+1)+\gamma$.

1292066,On random functions taking values in the space of continous functions.,"Here is the passage that is unclear to me ( Theoretical statistics by Keener): In this section we develop a weak law of large numbers for averages of random functions. This is used in the rest of the chapter to establish consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood and other estimators. Let $X_1, X_2, \dots$ be i.i.d., let $K$ be a compact set in $\mathbb{R}^p$ , and define $$ W_i(t) = h(t, X_i) \,, \quad t \in K$$ where $h(t,x)$ is a continuous function of $t$ for all $x$ . Then $W_1, W_2, \dots$ are i.i.d. random functions taking values in $C(K)$ , the space of continuous functions on $K$ . I do not understand how $W_1, W_2, \dots$ take values in $C(K)$ . For every different realization of the random variable they take as value a continuous  function?
So $W_i(t)$ does not only depend on $t$ and $i$ but also on the realised event on the sample space? Probably I realise I have never fully understood what the definition $W_i(t) = h(t,X_i)$ really means, could somebody guide me through it?","['probability-theory', 'definition', 'random-variables', 'stochastic-processes', 'statistics']"
1292067,Don't understand proof of minimum modulus principle,"Minimum modulus principle: If $f$ is a non-constant holomorphic function a bounded region $G$ and continuous on $\bar{G}$, then either $f$ has a zero in $G$ or $|f|$ assumes its minimum value on $\partial G$. 1) Why does $f$ has to be continuous on $\bar{G}$ and not just $G$? Proof: Let $F(z) = e^{f(z)}$. Then $|F(z)| = |e^{f(z)}| = e^{Re(f(z))} \geq e^{Re(f(a))}$ on $B(a, r)$. 2) Why is $e^{Re(f(z))} \geq e^{Re(f(a))}$ on $B(a, r)$? How do we know that the real part of $f(z)$ has a minimum in $B(a, r)$? Proof (cont'd): Then $F(a) = 0$ or $F(z)$ is constant on $B(a,r)$. 3) How do we know that $F(a) = 0$ or $F(z)$ is constant on $B(a,r)$? Proof (cont'd): $F(z) \neq 0$ so $F(z)$ is constant on $B(a,r)$, thus $f(z)$ is constant on $B(a,r)$ and by the Identity theorem, $f(z)$ is constant on $G$.

1292103,"If $\overline A\cap B = A\cap \overline B = \varnothing$, $A\cup B$ is disconnected.","I'm trying to show that if $\overline A\cap B = A\cap \overline B = \varnothing$, $A\cup B$ is disconnected. First of all, I think I have to assume that $A$ and $B$ are nonempty, or else the statement would not be true if I just let $A = \varnothing$ and let $B$ be a connected set. I'm working in a metric space where the definition of a set $S$ being open is that $\forall x\in S$, $\exists \varepsilon > 0: B(x,\varepsilon)\subseteq S$, and the definition of a set $T$ being closed is that $T$ is the complement of an open set. So assuming $A$ and $B$ are nonempty and $\overline A\cap B = A\cap \overline B = \varnothing$, to demonstrate that $S = A\cup B$ is disconnected I must find open sets $U_1$ and $U_2$ such that $U_1\cap U_2 = \varnothing$ $S = (S\cap U_1) \cup (S\cap U_2)$ $S\cap U_1\neq \varnothing$ and $S\cap U_2\neq \varnothing$. At first I thought of taking $U_1 = (\overline A)^c$ and $U_2 = (\overline B)^c$, but I don't necessarily know that these are disjoint. My second thought was this: Let $x\in A$. Then since $x\in (\overline B)^c$ and this set is open, $\exists \varepsilon_x > 0: B(x,\varepsilon_x)\subseteq (\overline B)^c$. Then I wanted to define $U_1 = \cup_{x\in A} B(x,\varepsilon_x)$ so that $A\subseteq U_1 \subseteq (\overline B)^c$, and then similarly define $U_2$ so that $B\subseteq U_2\subseteq (\overline A)^c$. However, I still don't think this works, since $U_1$ and $U_2$ could just share a point that is neither in $A$ nor $B$, but is in $(\overline A)^c \cap (\overline B)^c$.
