387749,Parametrization of $n$-spheres,"This comes from Guillemin and Pollack's book Differential Topology. The book claims that one cannot parametrize a unit circle by a single map. I thought we could (by a single angle $\theta$). I think one possible answer might be the fact that if we let $\theta$ in [0, 2$\pi$), when $\theta$ approaches 2$\pi$, $f(\theta)$ approaches $f(0)$. But is this a problem? Also for $n$-spheres, why is there always a point that can't be covered by a single map (I know we can always cover it by two maps, one being the stereographic projection)?

With many thanks to you, I now understand that #15 and #47 start and remain working with spherical coordinates. But in #23, my understanding is that the solution starts with $(x, y, z(x,y))$. Then it uses the Jacobian ($r dr d\theta$) while converting to polar coordinates. #23 is the only question for which the Jacobian is used (and not in #15 or #47). $\Large{\text{Q3.}}$ In your third paragraph, you commented on ""why this integral is phrased in terms of $r$ at all.""

You wrote in your second answer, for problem #23:  ""...But I must emphasize that that, in itself, is not using the Jacobian matrix, because the Jacobian matrix must act on some vector, converting it from one coordinate system to another.

387825,Segre varieties contained in hyperplanes,"Recall, the Segre embedding is a map $\sigma: \mathbb{P}^m \times \mathbb{P}^n \to \mathbb{P}^{(m+1)(n+1)-1}$ given by
\begin{equation}
([x_0:\cdots:x_m],[y_0:\cdots:y_n]) \mapsto [x_0y_0:x_0y_1: \cdots: x_iy_j:\cdots: x_my_n]
\end{equation} Call the image of $\sigma$ the Segre variety $\Sigma_{m,n}$.  I vaguely remember reading somewhere that no Segre variety is contained in a hyperplane in $\mathbb{P}^{(m+1)(n+1)-1}$.  This certainly feels true enough (since the defining equations for $\Sigma_{m,n}$ are quadratic, not linear), but writing down a proof in the general case seems difficult. In fact, we may consider the following generalization.  Let $X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^m$ and $Y \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ be varieties.  The Segre product of $X$ and $Y$ is the image $\sigma(X \times Y)$ in $\mathbb{P}^{(m+1)(n+1)-1}$.  Can someone supply a proof or reference that if $X$ and $Y$ are nonempty, then $\sigma(X \times Y)$ is never contained in a hyperplane?  If this turns out to be false, what conditions on $X$ and $Y$ are needed to guarantee this is true? Edit: It seems that this is false if either $X$ or $Y$ consists of points only.  So perhaps one needs to require that the varieties be at least one-dimensional.","['projective-space', 'algebraic-geometry']"

I hope that it will be proved interesting nevertheless. I used the name ""vector turn map"" due to lack of a better alternative. Let $f_A$ be a map defined as following. Choose any $2\times 2$ real matrix $A$. Then take a normalised vector, apply the map on the vector and renormalise it. So $f_A$ takes a normal vector and gives a normal vector, so it can be thought as a map $f_A:S^1\to S^1$. I thought of that because of an error propagation problem I am working on. My idea was to see the asymptotic behaviour of a random error vector. This lead to the Jacobian matrix applied to the error vector multiple times, so I want to see how this vector turns. My problem was over the complex numbers so I was searching for any known results. However after playing a bit with that, I figured out that it won't help me but I thought it is an interesting puzzle. So I thought I should write what I found out and ask for more information. To compute the map, we do the following. Take $\phi\in[0,1)$ to be the coordinate on $S^1$. Construct the vector $[\cos 2\pi \phi,\sin 2\pi \phi]$. Apply the map $A\cdot[\cos 2\pi \phi,\sin 2\pi \phi]$. And finally take the angle of the new vector. This can be written as $$f_A(\phi)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\mbox{arctan2}(A\cdot[\cos 2\pi \phi,\sin 2\pi \phi]).$$ The multiplication and division by $2\pi$ is to ensure that $\phi\in[0,1)$ or rather $\phi\in[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ depending on the definition on arctan2, it is not important at all. A few things can be told about $f_A$ right away. If $Av=\lambda v$ with $\lambda>0$ then $\phi_\lambda=\frac{1}{2\pi}\mbox{arctan2}(v)$ is a fixed point of $f_A$. Moreover $\phi_\lambda+\frac{1}{2}$ is also a fixed point since $-v$ is also an eigenvector. Also through some calculations if $\lambda_1>\lambda_2>0$ are eigenvalues of $A$ then $\phi_{\lambda_1}$ and $\phi_{\lambda_1}+\frac{1}{2}$ are stable points and $\phi_{\lambda_2}$, $\phi_{\lambda_2}+\frac{1}{2}$ are unstable. This is easy to see by taking the diagonal matrix $D=((1,0),(0,2))$. Then $D\cdot[x,y]=[x,2y]$, so we see that $D\cdot[x,y]$ turns a bit towards the vertical axis if $y\ne0$. If $\lambda_1<\lambda_2<0$, then we see that $f_A(\phi_{\lambda_i})=\phi_{\lambda_i}+\frac{1}{2}$. The situation is similar, but now instead of a fixed point, we have a 2-periodic orbit. The one that corresponds to the eigenvalue with the largest absolute value is stable and the other is unstable. If one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, then there is a fixed point and a 2-periodic orbit, with their stability determined by the absolute value of the eigenvalues. If $A$ has only one eigenvector (it is similar to a Jordan block) with positive eigenvalue. Then there are only two fixed points that are stable from one direction and unstable from the other. If the eigenvalue is negative then instead of a fixed point we have a 2-periodic orbit with similar properties. An very useful observation is that similar matrices correspond to ""similar"" maps. Similar in the sense that they have the same number of fixed points (or 2-periodic orbits) with the same stability. I haven't really proven that but with a little thought it becomes almost obvious. I think it can be proven by writing down a couple of commutative diagrams. Now with that said, it is natural to define an other map $g_A$ by taking $\phi\in[0,\frac{1}{2})$. This can be done by using arctan instead of arctan2 (and tweaking the details). Then fixed points and 2-periodic orbits of $f_A$ are fixed points of $g_A$ with the same stability. So in a sense one could say that $g_A$ is a simplification of $f_A$. However this is true only in the $2\times2$ case. The real difference is that $f_A:S^1\to S^1$ but $g_A:\mathbb{P}^1\to \mathbb{P}^1$ ($\mathbb{P}^1$ is the projective line which here is practiacally the same as the circle). By the way the $2\times 2$ case is nice because one can draw pictures. By plugging in the equation in a program like mathematica or matlab, one can get the cobweb diagram and see  the behaviour of the map. The real fun begins when the same is considered in higher dimensions. So let $A$ be an $n\times n$ real matrix. Then by the same procedure one can define $f_A:S^{n-1}\to S^{n-1}$. Again eigenvectors give fixed points or 2-periodic orbits. Based on intuition I would expect that that the stability is determined by the eigenvalue, so the largest eigenvalues (in absolute value) will correspond to a stable point, the smallest to an unstable and the intermediate to some kind of saddles. Now we also have $g_A:\mathbb{P}^n\to \mathbb{P}^n$, so now the difference is rather significant. A conjugacy between $f_A$ and $g_A$ is expected, as in the $2\times 2$ case, but I would expect some complications. Finally it would be also interesting to check complex cases of the map for their behaviour. One interesting question for example is whether the $4\times 4$ real case actually contains the $2\times 2$ complex one. Anyway, I would hope that this is something that is known and that people have worked on it. If not I would be interested to anything that anyone finds. I just put it here as a mathematical curiosity.","['dynamical-systems', 'matrices']"

In [Herstein, Topics in Algebra, p. 69], a construction of a nonabelian group of order 21 is given as follows:  Let $G=C_7 = \langle a \rangle$, $\phi: a \mapsto a^2$ be an automorphism of $G$ of order 3, and consider all formal symbols $x^i a^j$ subject to conditions $x^3=a^7=e, x^{-1}ax=a^2$, and we get a nonabelian group of order 21. The text continues that, more generally, if $G$ is a group, $T$ an automorphism of order $r$ of $G$ which is not an inner automorphism, pick a symbol $x$ and consider all elements $x^i g$, $i \in \mathbb{Z}, g \in G$, subject to $x^ig=x^{i'}g'$ iff $i \equiv i'(r), g =g'$, and $x^{-1} g^i x = gT^i$ for all $i$.  Then, we obtain a larger group $\{G,T\}$, with $G \trianglelefteq \{G,T\}, \{G,T\}/G \cong C_r$.  I think it is common to denote this group by the semidirect product $G \rtimes C_r$.

Here's the ""logic"" behind it Rule: If you flip a coin enough times(x) the number of heads(H) and tails(T) will be equal to each other (law of large numbers?) H + T = x  AND 1/2H = 1/2T AND 1/2H / 1/2T = 1 This could happen at after flipping HT or THTTHH or HHTHTHTT... extra And Now The System!!! The first bet(more like lack of bet) you make is for $0, you have 1/2H / (1/2H + 1/2T) chance of getting heads. The coin flips tails.  Therefor x is now x-1 and T is now T-1 and H is still the same.  So now you have 1/2H / (1/2H + 1/2T - 1) chance of flipping heads.  Because 1/2H / (1/2H + 1/2T) = 50% chance of flipping heads and 1/2H / (1/2H + 1/2T - 1) is not equal to 1/2H / (1/2H + 1/2T) then 1/2H / (1/2H + 1/2T - 1) is not equal to a 50% chance of flipping heads.  How can this be? PLEASE do not say every time the next flip will be heads or tails, therefor you have a 50% chance of flipping heads... of course I know this!!!  I want to know what is wrong with my logic not that it is wrong, I already know that it is wrong... On a side note this system would never work in a real life senario because no casino offers 1:1 odds which this system needs.

Show that $\{2, x\}$ is not a basis for $M$. Show that any 2 elements of $M$ are linearly dependent. Show that $M$ is not a free $R$-module. My approach so far: Suppose by way of contradiction $\{2, x\}$ is in fact a basis for $M$, then it would follow that $2$ and $x$ are linearly independent, that is for $\alpha(x), \beta(x) \in \mathbb Z[x]$, if $2\alpha(x) + \beta(x)x = 0$ then it must follow that $\alpha(x) = \beta(x) = 0$, but observe that $\alpha(x) = x$ and $\beta(x) = -2$ satisfies this equation and they are both non-zero. Conclude that $\{2, x\}$ is a linearly dependent set, a contradiction to our hypothesis that $\{2, x\}$ is a basis of $M$. Conclude that $\{2, x\}$ is not a basis for $M$. Now I am stuck on the second part. I choose two arbitrary elements of $M = (2, x) = \{2f(x) + g(x)x : f, g \in \mathbb Z[x]\}$. Say $a, b \in M$ then by construction $a(x) = 2f_1(x) + g_1(x)x$ and $b(x) = 2f_2(x) + g_2(x)x$. If $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb Z[x]$, that is, $a, b$ scalar and if $\alpha(x)a(x) + \beta(x)b(x) = 0$ we want to show that $\alpha(x)$, $\beta(x)$ are not both necessarily both zero. I started trying to choose values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ nonzero such that the equality holds, but it never works out. Any help here would be appreciated. For the final part, I'm assuming the second part will help. I'm guessing if we show the dimension of $M$ over $\mathbb Z[x]$ must be 2, and then since we know any two elements in $M$ must be linearly dependent, no basis could exist. But my reasoning is a guess, I don't know why mathematically the dimension must be 2, or even if this is the best approach to this part of the problem. Finally I searched online before asking the question here, I found two proofs using the concept of 'rank', but I'd prefer not to use this in my proof since I am unfamiliar with the concept.","['modules', 'linear-algebra']"

We define the norm $||x||_E = \max\limits_{s \in B} \left\{ |x(s)|_2 + ||x'(s)|| \right\}$. $F = C(A; \color{red}{\mathbb{R}^n})$, i.e the space of continuous functions from $A$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$, with the norm $||y||_F = \max\limits_{t \in A} \{ |y(t)|_2 \}$ Where $|\bullet|_2$ is the normal Euclidean norm. Define $T: E \to F$ as follow:
$$T(x)(t) = \int\limits_B f(t;s;x(s);x'(s)) ds$$ Question Prove that $T$ is compact. $\color{green}{\mathbf{(done) :)}}$ Assume that all partial derivative of $f$ wrt every variable is continuous. Prove that: For all $x \in E$, $T(x)$ has continuous partial derivatives. $\color{green}{\mathbf{(this \ is \ also \ done) :)}}$ For all $x \in E$, prove that $T$ is differentiable at $x$; and that, for every $h \in E$; $t \in A$, we'll have: $$T'(x)(h)(t) = \int\limits_B [ \left< f_x(t;s;x(s);x'(s);h(s)) \right> + \left< f_{x'}(t;s;x(s);x'(s);h'(s)) \right>] ds$$ Where $$\left< f_x(t;s;x(s);x'(s));h(s) \right> = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(t;s;x(s);x'(s)) h_i(s)$$ My difficulties Should the $\color{red}{\mathbb{R}^n}$ at the beginning of the problem be changed to $\mathbb{R}$? Since I don't think that integral would return something in $\mathbb{R}^n$ at all. Or, am I missing something here? I don't really know where that monstrous $T'(x)(h)(t)$ comes from. I would be glad if someone can give me a small push. I know that we're supposed to use the uniform continuous property of $f$ on some compact set; and the mean value theorem, but I haven't come across any functions that have $x'(s)$ as its perimeter.

388382,What's the mathematical field called where functions create and delete functions?,"Motivation In the field of modular, reconfigurable robotics there are some groups which use term rewriting, or specifically graph rewriting to describe the reconfiguration process of the modular robots. Grammar rules reflect state changes: $$
a   b \rightarrow  a - c
$$ would correspond to the real-world event in which a robot in state $a$ meets a robot in state $b$. The ""$-$""-token reflects a physical connection. And the rule states that the robot in state $b$ transitions into state $c$. This one rule is valid for the entire population of robots. The word ""stochastic"" is used in this context to reflect that robots in state $a$ and $b$ are picked at random from a large population of robots. General case Suppose we write this as: $$
f(P_{t}(x)) = P_{t+1}(x)
$$ with $P_{t+1}(x)$ the distribution of states over the population, and $f$ our set of rewriting rules. It just does not seem to describe the same system. For example, suppose I would generalize a bit from rewriting states to rewriting functions: $$
f(a)   g(a) \rightarrow  g(a) h(a)
$$ which would reflect the situation that in a set of functions (with unique names $f,g,h$), we would take a function $f$ and a function $g$, would replace $f$ with $g$ and would replace $g$ with $h$. The function $h$ can be taken out of a set of predefined functions, or be composed out of $f$ and $g$. The function $f$ here is ""deleted"". So, there is some kind of quantity of ""occurrence"" attached to each function. There must be a mathematical discipline that handles this type of function annihilation and creation.

388634,Natural extension of the divisor function $\sigma$ to the complex integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]$,"The divisor function $\sigma$ of a positive integer $n$ is defined as the sum of the positive divisors of $n$. It turns out that this definition is equivalent to $$\sigma(n)=\prod_{\substack{p^\alpha||n\\p\in\mathbb{P}}}\frac{p^{\alpha+1}-1}{p-1}\tag{1}$$ We can extend this function to the non-zero integers by simply neglecting the negative divisors. What we actually do, mathematically, is making the factorization unique - this is possible only if we have one unit. As before, we could actually use the expression $(1)$ to define $\sigma$. Now, I wonder how the divisor function could be naturally extended to the non-zero complex integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]^*$. There are several obvious candidates, but all of them fail in one way or another. I will describe the perhaps most natural. Were we to sum over all divisors of a complex integer $z$, it is obvious that the divisors would cancel and the sum would be zero; this was also the case for the negative integers. We avoided this by finding a unique factorization of every integer. This time, the same idea cannot be applied directly, but what we can do is write any non-zero complex integer as the product of complex primes in the first quadrant of the complex plane and a unit. We then shave off the unit, and use the expression $(1)$ for the complex prime powers; that is, $$\sigma(z)=\prod_{p^\alpha||z}\frac{p^{\alpha+1}-1}{p-1}\tag{2},$$ where each $p$ is a complex prime lying in the first quadrant. Unfortunately, this function will fail to correspond to the original for real integers; what is more, it is even complex-valued there. I find this drawback important, as it means that this extended function cannot directly be used to find new properties of the classical one (which is often the case for complex extension). One might wonder if there is any use of a invented function like this. However, there is also a good part; the function is still multiplicative and it satisfies the inequality $|\sigma(z)|\ge z$. Also, Robert Spira already studied this function in 1961. My question is, what is the most meaningful extension that still corresponds to the original divisor function for the real integers?","['complex-numbers', 'divisibility', 'number-theory']"

388724,Hartshorne Proposition II.6.5,"The statement of part (a) of this proposition is as follows: Let $X$ be a noetherian integral separated scheme which is regular in codimension 1. Let $Z$ be a proper closed subset of $X$, and let $U=X\setminus Z$. Then there is a surjective homomorphism $\mathrm{Cl}(X)\to\mathrm{Cl}(U)$ defined by $\sum n_i Y_i\mapsto\sum n_i(Y_i\cap U)$, ignoring empty intersections. Now, this seems like it should be blatantly obvious, and the proof in the book more or less treats it as such. I'm having trouble with the first line: If $Y$ is a prime divisor on $X$, then $Y\cap U$ is either empty or a prime divisor on $U$. Clearly the former possibility is trivial. For some reason, I'm having trouble with the latter. A prime divisor is defined to be a closed integral subscheme of codimension one. Now, obviously $Y\cap U$ is closed in $U$. But to refer to it as a closed subscheme, don't I need to know what the subscheme structure is? Earlier they refer to the induced reduced closed subscheme structure; I guess I'm supposed to assume this is what they mean, but I'm not 100% sure (though I don't know what else makes sense). Moving past this for now, I need to know that $Y\cap U$ is integral in $U$ and that $\mathrm{codim}(Y\cap U,U)=1$. Maybe I'm just confusing myself here; since $Y$ is integral (it's a prime divisor on $X$) and $Y\cap U$ is open in $Y$, we know $Y\cap U$ is integral as a subscheme of $Y$; that is, $(Y\cap U, \mathcal{O}_Y|_{Y\cap U})$ is an integral scheme. But is this the same as the closed subscheme structure of $Y\cap U\subseteq U$? Does it even matter? Finally, the codimension; $\mathrm{codim}(Y,X)=1$ means that there are no irreducible closed subsets of $X$ strictly between $Y$ and $X$ (both are integral, hence irreducible themselves). I think I can see at least why this is true. Assuming we know $Y\cap U$ is an integral (hence irreducible) closed subscheme of $U$, either its codimension is one or it equals $U$. But the latter would force $U\subseteq Y$, which would make $X=Y\cup Z$ not irreducible, which would be a contradiction. I'd greatly appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction here; am I way overthinking this? Or are there really some subtleties that I'm not seeing?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
388727,Is $f$ necessarily measurable?,"(1) Suppose a function $f$ has a [Lebesgue] measurable domain and is continuous except at a finite number of points. Is $f$ is necessarily [Lebesgue] measurable? Comments For (1), If $f$ is defined on a [Lebesgue] measurable set $E$ and is continuous except for a finite number of values say $x_1,x_2, ... x_n$ are those points of discontinuity, then can't we describe the pre-images of $f$ just as a finite union of of the pre-images of the collection of continuous functions $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$, where each $f_i$ is defined up between each point of discontinuity of $f$? Or am I missing something here? (2) Suppose the function $f$ is defined on a measurable set $E$ and has the property that $\{x \in E | f(x) > c\}$ is measurable for each rational number $c$. Is $f$ necessarily [Lebesgue] measurable? Comments I got this one, thanks to everyone who commented. Any hints would be appreciated.

388785,Factorial of Infinite Cardinal,"I have been thinking about the following problem: Let $A$ be a set of cardinality $k$ and denote $\sum_A$ the set of all bijection from $A$ to $A$ . Also denote $k! = \mathrm{card}\left(\sum_A \right)$ . Prove that $k!=2^k$ . My proof consists of finding a bijection $F:\sum_A\to P(A)$ which associates each bijection from the left to the set of its fixed points. Then the result would follow.
( $P(A)$ =the power set of $A$ ). Since this proof seems quite easy I am afraid it is wrong. Can someone enlighten me?

The question is related to hyperbolic functions, so I let $x = 4\cosh(u)$ therefore the integral becomes: $$-\int_{0}^{\ln(2)}\frac{4\sinh(u)}{\sqrt{16-16\cosh^{2}(u)}}du = -\int_{0}^{\ln(2)}1du = -\ln(2)$$ The answer is $\ln(2)$ so if someone could point out where I went wrong that would be great, thanks","['calculus', 'integration']"

388829,Connection between irreducibly diagonally dominant matrices and positive definiteness?,"I am attempting to prove a proposition that I found in Cottle's ""The Linear Complementarity Problem"" book in which the proof has been omitted. I will start by introducing some definitions. ${\bf Def.}$ A matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is said to be irreducible if and only if for any two distinct indices $1\le i,j\le n$, there is a sequence of nonzero elements of $A$ of the form
$$
\{a_{ii_1},a_{i_1i_2},\ldots,a_{i_mj}\}.
$$ ${\bf Def.}$ A matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is irreducibly diagonally dominant if it is irreducible, weakly diagonally dominant, $|A_{ii}| \ge \sum_{j\neq i}|A_{ij}|$ for all $i$, and there is at least one row or column where strict diagonal dominance holds, that is $\exists$ $i$ such that $|A_{ii}| > \sum_{j\neq i}|A_{ij}|$. The statement is as follows. ${\bf Prop.}$ Let $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be symmetric, strictly or irreducibly diagonally dominant, and $A_{ii}>0$ for all $i$, then $A$ is positive definite. ${\bf Pf.}$ (attempt, sketch) My attempt used the Gershgorin Circle Theorem which allowed me to show that the eigenvalues of the matrix were all nonnegative, with one strictly positive. However, I do not know how to use irreducibility or the fact that $A$ has strictly positive diagonal entries to conclude that it is positive definite.","['matrices', 'gershgorin-sets']"
388831,When is an intersection of varieties finite,"Consider the general Bezout's theorem: If $p_1 \ldots p_n$ are polynomials with degrees $d_1,\ldots, d_n$ in $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, with $V = \{a=(a_1,\ldots, a_n) | p_i(a) = 0, \forall i\}$ finite, then $|V| \le \prod d_i$. My question is when do $p_i$ guarantee that $V$ is finite (and then Bezout bounds how many points are in V)? I am looking more for a geometric criterion (such as something to do with the tangent spaces) rather than an algebraic criterion. Reading up on this, I see that the criterion of transversal intersection is related to this, but I do not understand too well. Is there an easier criterion for $|V|$ finite when all the degrees are equal (this is easy when $d=1$, as these are hyperplanes. Is $d=2$ significantly harder?)","['intersection-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves', 'polynomials']"
