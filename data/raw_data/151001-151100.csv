2517774,Orientation of a sphere,"I am having a hard time wrapping my head around notions of an orientable two-sided surface in $3$ dimensional space. For instance, the sphere in $\Bbb R^3$ is the set $\{ (x,y,z) \in \Bbb R^3 :  ||(x,y,z)|| = 1 \}$, and a normal vector that points outward of the sphere is given at any point $(x,y,z)$ by $xi + yj + zk$. Now having said all that, which points are on the ""inside"" and which are on the ""outside""? Perhaps I have misunderstood the concept. Any clarifications much appreciated.","['multivariable-calculus', 'geometry']"
2517789,$4\mid\phi(n)$ for most $n$,"This is from an exercise in LeVeque's Fundamentals of number theory. Let $N$ be a positive integer. If $f(N)$ denotes the number of
  positive integers $n \leq N$ such that $4 \not\mid \phi(n)$ then
  $\lim_{N\to\infty} \dfrac{f(N)}{N}=0.$ My observations so far : since $4\not\mid\phi(n)$ iff $n$ is $1,2,4$ or of the form $p^k$ or $2p^k$ where $p$ is a prime of the form $4m+3$. So it is sufficient to show that $g(N)$: the number of integers $\leq N$ of the form $p^k$ where $p$ is a prime of the form $4m+3$, is $o(N)$. We have,
$$g(N) = \sum_{ \substack{p \leq N\\ p \text{ is prime of the form } 4m+3}} \left \lfloor \dfrac{\ln N}{\ln p} \right\rfloor,$$ but I can't figure out how to show the above is $o(N)$.",['number-theory']

2517869,Intuition behind kernel is trivial implies homomorphism is injective.,"Let $G$ and $H$ be groups, and let $\pi : G \rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism. If $\pi$ is injective, then $\ker(\pi) = \{e_G\}$. If my understanding is correct, this is because identities are mapped to identities in a homomorphism, and if $\pi$ is injective, there is only one element in the preimage of $\{e_H\}$, namely $e_G$. Does such an intuition exist as to explain why: if $\ker(\pi) = \{e_G\}$, then $\pi$ is injective? I can prove this symbolically, but I feel like I have no clue why this should be true.","['intuition', 'group-homomorphism', 'group-theory']"
2517880,When is it possible to extend a set function not defined on a semiring to a measure?,"I have a class $\mathcal{C}$ of subsets of a nonempty and uncountable set $\Omega$. $\mathcal{C}$ is not a semiring. As I know, $\mathcal{C}$ is a semiring if the followings are true: (1) $\emptyset\in\mathcal{C}$ (2) $A,B\in\mathcal{C}\Rightarrow A\cap B\in\mathcal{C}$ (3) If $A,B\in\mathcal{C}$ and $A\subset B$, then there exist pairwise disjoint $C_1,\cdots,C_n\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $B\setminus A=\cup_{i=1}^nC_i$. My $\mathcal{C}$ satisfies (1) and (3). In addition, $\Omega\in\mathcal{C}$. But it does not satisfy (2). Hence $\mathcal{C}$ is not a semiring. Moreover, $A\cap B$ may not be able to be written as finite union of disjoint elements in $\mathcal{C}$. I also have a set function $\mu$ defined on $\mathcal{C}$. $\mu$ satisfies (a) $\mu(\emptyset)=0$; $\mu(\Omega)=1$ (b) If $A_1,\cdots,A_n\in\mathcal{C}$ are pairwise disjoint and $\cup_{i=1}^nA_i\in\mathcal{C}$, then $\mu(\cup_{i=1}^nA_i)=\sum_{i=1}^n\mu(A_i)$. (c) For $A,B\in\mathcal{C}$ with $A\subset B$, $\mu(B)\geq\mu(A)$. I want to ask when can I extend $\mu$ to be a probability measure (just finitely additive is fine)?

(or other condition on $\mu$?) I encounter such problem in my research project. My goal is to prove that there exist a probability measure which agrees with $\mu$ on $\mathcal{C}$.

2517932,Locally convex subspace,"While studying functional analysis the following question came up. Let $(E, P)$ be a locally convex space where $P$ is a family of seminorms. Also, let $F \subseteq E$ be a linear subspace endowed with the family of seminorms $P_F := \{p_{\vert F} \; : \; p \in P\}$. Show that a subset $V \subseteq F$ is open with regard to $P_F$ if and only if $V = U \cap F$ where $U \subseteq E$ and $U$ is open with regard to $P$. What I tried so far is the following. First, since $F$ is a linear subspace we know that $0 \in F$ and $E$ is locally convex, the intersection of convex sets is convex which makes $(F, P_F)$ a locally convex space as well, i.e. there is a balanced absorbing convex local base at zero. Also, $V$ being open with regard to the family of seminorms in the space $(F,P_F)$ is to say that $$\forall x \in V, \ \exists \ \epsilon_x > 0, p_1^x, \ldots, p_{n_x}^x \in P_F \ : V(x, p_1^x, \ldots, p_{n_x}^x, \epsilon_x) = \bigcap_{i=1}^{n_x} \{y \in F : p_i^x(x - y) < \epsilon\} \subseteq V$$ For the ""$\Rightarrow$"" direction I now have to somehow show that, based on this notion of $V$ being open, we can infer that there has to be another set $U \subseteq E$ which is open to the entire seminorm family and for which it holds that $V = U \cap F$. But why is this the case? The other ""$\Leftarrow$"" direction seems to be clearer. Since $U$ is open to the entire family of seminorms, we can restrict it to those sets being open to $P_F$ by intersecting it with $F$. But this seems heuristic at best, how would one use the notions of local convexity and openess regarding a seminorm system correctly to write it down?","['functional-analysis', 'locally-convex-spaces']"

By symmetry, this probability is clearly at least $1/k$ for any $n$. However, for fixed $n$ it is slightly larger than $1/k$ because the maximum can be equal for many rooms.

Let $S \subseteq M$ be a $k$ -dimensional embedded submanifold which is also compact, connected and orientable. Suppose we are given a smooth embedding $F:S \to \mathbb{R}^d$ . Question: Suppose that $TM|_S$ is a trivial vector bundle. Is it true that the quotients $TM|_S \big/ TS$ and $S \times \mathbb{R}^d\big/dF(TS)$ are isomorphic as vector bundles? The triviality of $TM|_S$ is an obvious necessary condition, since if $TM|_S \big/ TS \cong S \times \mathbb{R}^d\big/dF(TS)$ , then $$TM|_S \cong TS \oplus TM|_S \big/ TS \cong dF(TS) \oplus S \times \mathbb{R}^d\big/dF(TS) \cong S \times \mathbb{R}^d.$$ Of course, isomorphic bundles and subbundles can induce non-isomorphic quotients, so $TS \cong dF(TS)$ and $TM|_S \cong S \times \mathbb{R}^d$ do not imply the quotients are isomorphic. My guess is that the answer can be negative in general, but I don't know how to find a counterexample.

2518129,Geometric distribution with increasing chance of success,"I have the following problem (perhaps it could be seen as a variant of the geometric distribution): I'd like to know the expected number of trials needed to get the (single) special ticket among n tickets. Tickets are drawn without replacement. The distribution of a generalized version of this problem is here: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/436247 The given distribution is: $p_i \prod_{k=1}^{i-1}(1 - p_k)$, where $p_i$ is the probability of success at i-th trial. This looks like a generalized version of the geometric random variable. In my specific case, $p_i = \frac{1}{n-i+1}$, because on each trial, the number of tickets to draw reduces by 1. It might seem trivial, but I'm having trouble to calculate the mean of ""my"" distribution, which would give the expected number of trials until success... This could be a well-known problem already, but I was not able to find a reference for it (I found it's ""inverse"" here: A Diminishing Geometric Distribution ). So, any help is appreciated. EDIT: took out the sentence ""until I'll certainly get the special ticket on the last trial"" because one could infer that $p_n = 1$, implying $p_i = 0$ for $i < n$, which is not the case. EDIT: took out the sentence ""on the 1st trial the chance of selecting the special ticket is $1/n$, on 2nd it is $1/(n-1)$ and so on."" because it can be misleading.

2518184,Covering a disc with smaller disks,"This is an exercise from the Kürschák Mathematics competition from 1947: The radius of each small disc is half of the large disc. How many small disks are needed to cover the large disc completely? I assume they ask for the minimal number of small disks. So, to cover the plane with disks with ""minimal overlapping"" we have to do something like: The question is how to place the large disk on this picture so that it overlaps with the least amount of small disks. If we place the large disk so that its middlepoint is in the middle as so: then it overlaps with all the $12$ small circles on the picture but I recon we can do better. If we shift the large disk so its centerpoint coincides with one of the small disks' then it will overlap with $9$ small disks. this looks minimal, but I have a hard time finding a rigorous way showing this. I tried looking at the lattice the small disks' middlepoints define and reason just using the middlepoints but without any good conclusion. I have solutions on the back of the book (where I found the exercise) but it would be better if I myself (with maybe some help from MSE) could cook up something reasonable.

It’s clear that for every $t$, $X(t, \dot)$ is a random variable. What I don’t see is how we get a “path” or “trajectory” when we fix $\omega$. For example, suppose we use a simple random walk where we toss a coin, and if the coin lands heads, then $X(heads)=1$ and we move one step up, and, if the coin lands tails, then $X(tails)=-1$ and we move one step down. Our initial point is 0. So, in this case, if I fixed my $\omega$ to be heads, then wouldn’t the trajectory, or path, be represented by the function $f(t)=t$? Alternatively, if we fixed $\omega$ to be tails, then the trajectory would be $f(t)=-t$. Obviously, there are infinite amount of trajectories, or realizations, (going up and down) that repesent this simple walk.

I reckon if I can show this relation satisfies the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties then I will have solved the problem. But how do I apply the reflexive property to this problem?

Now I can think of the plane that the two points are in as the cartesian product $\Bbb{R} \times \Bbb{R}$. So I will have shown that the relation is reflexive if I can show $xCx$ for every $x$ in $\Bbb{R}$. But how do I show this? Doesn't $xCx$ imply that $(x,x) \in C$?

The three corners of the triangle trace the three medians of the triangle.  Therefore, the three medians intersect at a point. I spent some time thinking about why exactly the three corners would trace the median, and not some other line.  The reason (I think) lies in the side opposite to the corner.

In the proof of existence and uniqueness of Kirillov model, the key step is that we give the subspace $V_0 \subseteq V$ defined by
\begin{equation*}
V_0:= \left \{ v \in V \Bigg| \int_{p^{-n}\mathbb{Z_p}} e_p(-u)\pi \left( \begin{pmatrix} 1&u\\ 0&1 \end{pmatrix} \right) \cdot v\;du=0,\;\text{for all big}\;n \right \}

and prove that $\dim(V/V_0)=1$. Here $e_p$ is the nontrivial additive character from $\mathbb{Q_p}$ to $S^1$. Now we fix a vector $v \in V$ and for each positive integer $n$, we define the integral $I(n)$ as follows:
\begin{equation*}
I(n):=\int_{p^{-n}\mathbb{Z_p}} e_p(-u)\pi \left( \begin{pmatrix} 1&u\\ 0&1 \end{pmatrix} \right) \cdot v\;du.

We want to show that there exists a big positive integer $N$, s.t. for arbitrary $n>N$, we have $I(n)=I(n+1)=I(n+2)=\cdots$.In other word, we want to prove the stability of the given integral. My idea is following:
Using the substitution rule and the topological structure of $p^{-n}\mathbb{Z_p}$, for any positive integer $n$, we have
\begin{equation*}
I(n+1)=\left(\sum_{j=0}^{p-1} e_p\left(-\frac{j}{p^{n+1}}\right)\pi \left( \begin{pmatrix} 1&\frac{j}{p^{n+1}}\\ 0&1 \end{pmatrix} \right)\right) I(n).

Can we also get the stability of the integral from the above equation?

\int_{0}^{\tau} |(w_n)_y(0,t)|^2 dt \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \rightarrow +\infty
\end{equation}
By above argument, we know that $\{w_n(0)\}$ is bounded in $H_0^1(0,1)$, so $\{w_n\}$ is bounded in
$L_{\infty}(0,\tau;H_0^1(0,1)) \bigcap W^{1,\infty}(0,\tau;H^{-1}(0,1))$. Then we can subtract a subsequence (that we still denote by $w_n$) such that
\begin{equation}
w_n \rightarrow w \quad \text{in} \quad L_{\infty}(0,\tau;H_0^1(0,1)) \quad \text{weak}^*

\begin{equation}
(w_n)_t \rightarrow w_t \quad \text{in} \quad L_{\infty}(0,\tau;H^{-1}(0,1)) \quad \text{weak}^*
\end{equation}
The function $w \in L_{\infty}(0,\tau;H_0^1(0,1)) \bigcap W^{1,\infty}(0,\tau;H^{-1}(0,1))$ is clearly a solution of Schrodinger equation. From the compactness of embedding 
\begin{equation}
L_{\infty}(0,\tau;H_0^1(0,1)) \bigcap W^{1,\infty}(0,\tau;H^{-1}(0,1)) \rightarrow C([0,\tau];L_2(0,1))
\end{equation}
and using the above arguments, we deduce $\|w(0)\|_{L_2(0,1)} = 1 \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $w_y(0,t) = 0$ on $[0,\tau]$. From Holmgren's Uniqueness Theorem, that implies $w = 0$. This is a contradiction. "" I do not understand how to apply the Holmgren's Uniqueness Theorem ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmgren%27s_uniqueness_theorem ) in this case.

In practice, when calculating the area of Great Britain, say, I have following picture in mind. This process can be made rigorous via measure theory. Indeed it is the unique measure, if rectangles have area $length \times width$ by Carathéodory’s extension theorem. However this process is limited to area in the plane.

However, there are counterexamples in the general case, namely $H=\mathbb{Z}$, $K=\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$, and $G=\bigoplus_{i=1}^\infty\mathbb{Z}$. I am wondering what goes wrong with the following argument: Form the split short exact sequence $$0 \to G \xrightarrow{i} G \oplus H \xrightarrow{\pi} H \to 0$$ where $i$ and $\pi$ are the inclusion and projection, respectively. Then don't we immediately get from the first isomorphism theorem that $H \cong (G \oplus H)/G$, which would contradict the counterexample above? If we run this for the counterexample given, we get the sequence $$0 \to \bigoplus_{i=1}^\infty\mathbb{Z} \to \bigoplus_{i=1}^\infty\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0$$ which seems to still be short exact, even though here $G \cong G \oplus H$. But of course here we can see directly that $(G \oplus H)/G \cong G/G$, which is trivial. So what went wrong? It seems to me to be something along these lines: In this case, the kernel of the projection is not the same as the original group, it is just, say, $0 \oplus \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \oplus \dots$, i.e. nontrivial from the second coordinate on, which just happens to be isomorphic to the original group. So if we form the other short exact sequence with $K$ in place of $H$, then the difference seems to be that we have two different projection maps with different (but isomorphic) kernels. But I'm not really sure how to explain this in the general case, if my reasoning is correct to begin with.

Since with the identity $|A| \, \Delta |A| = \frac 1 2 \Delta |A|^2 - |\nabla|A||^2$ there is no more square root in the first term, I suppose the problematic term is the latter. Now, it should be somehow possible to get rid of the derivatives by multiplying with a test function and integrating by parts. However, I can't see how this works. EDIT 1 What I tried is to get rid of derivatives of $|A|$ (without the square). Let $\varphi \in C^\infty_c(M)$, then $$\int |\nabla |A||^2 \, \varphi = \underbrace{\int \nabla \cdot (|A|\, \nabla |A| \, \varphi)}_{=0} - \int |A| \, \nabla |A| \cdot \nabla \varphi - \int |A| \, \Delta |A| \, \varphi$$ Now the first term is total divergence, so it will vanish. But how about the second? How do I get rid of the derivative in front of $|A|$? EDIT 2 Eric Silva mentioned in the comments below, that $|A|$ would satisfy an elliptic PDE, as shown in Simons' paper. However, in Simons' paper (and in Holck-Minicozzi's book, eq. (2.16)) I can only find an elliptic PDE for $|A|^2$, whence I still have no clue about the regularity of $|A|$. Or am I wrong here? EDIT 3 I think what could work is a convergence argument. Observe that upon multiplication with $|A|^2$ all the (possibly) singular terms behave smoothly. Now I want to show that for $\varphi \in C^\infty_c(M)$ with $\varphi_\varepsilon = \frac 1 \varepsilon \, \min\{\varepsilon,|A|^2\} \to \varphi \,\, (\varepsilon \to 0)$ we have $$\int_M |\nabla |A||^2 \, \varphi = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int_M |\nabla |A||^2 \, \varphi_\varepsilon < \infty$$ Does someone have an idea or a tip for me?

2520623,"A deck of 40 cards, 4 suits from 1 to 10, 2 cards extracted, probability the sum is 9?","You have a deck of $40$ cards, $4$ suits from $1$ to $10$, pick randomly $2$ cards, no reimmission, what  is the probability you get $9$ as a sum? How can I solve using the basic principle of counting? The favorable outcome are $(8+1)*4$, $(7+2)*4$, $(6+3)*4$ and $(5+4)*4$, so $64$ possible combination?
But what about the all the possible outcome? Are $40*39$? From a MC simulation the results seems $~0.08$, but I can't do analytically. EDIT: The numerator is wrong, a combination can be also 1 and then 8, 2+7 and so on, the combinations are, actually, doubled, 128. $$ \frac{128}{40\cdot39} = .0821 $$ 
Thank you all for the answer.",['probability']
2520680,How to compute the gradient of the norm for linear least squares?,I am reading about Solution of the Linear Least Squares Problem. Given the function $$f(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \lVert y - \Phi \theta \rVert _{2}^{2}$$ To find the minimizer we need to compute the gradient of f. The text says that $$\nabla f(\theta^{*}) = 0 \leftrightarrow \Phi^{T}\Phi\theta^{*} - \Phi^{T}y = 0$$ Can someone help me and explain how to compute the gradient of f? I don't understand why $$\nabla f(\theta^{*}) = \Phi^{T}\Phi\theta^{*} - \Phi^{T}y$$,"['matrices', 'matrix-calculus', 'linear-algebra', 'least-squares']"
