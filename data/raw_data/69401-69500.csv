841028,What good is the Commutator product?,"In geometric algebra, the commutator product is defined as $A \times B = \frac 1 2 (AB - BA)$. From linear algebra, I remember that the commutator of matrices is $[A, B] = AB - BA$ and the commutator of linear functions is likewise $[f,g]=fg-gf$.  Looking at my notes I see that skew transformations are closed under this operation.  But why is that important? Why do we need this product/ operation?  Can I use it to prove some cool theorems or is it useful in performing some algorithms?  What is the point of the commutator?","['geometric-algebras', 'linear-algebra']"

841114,Probability Puzzle: Mutating Loaded Die,"Take an (initially) fair six-sided die (i.e. $P(x)=\frac{1}{6}$ for $x=1,â€¦,6$) and roll it repeatedly. After each roll, the die becomes loaded for the next roll depending on the number $y$ that was just rolled according to the following system: $$P(y)=\frac{1}{y}$$
$$P(x)=\frac{1 - P(y)}{5} \text{, for } x \ne y$$ i.e. the probability that you roll that number again in the next roll is $\frac{1}{y}$ and the remaining numbers are of equal probability. What is the probability that you roll a $6$ on your $n$th roll? NB: This is not a homework or contest question, just an idea I had on a boring bus ride.

841163,Expected value of the function of a random variable,"I am studying Probability and Monte Carlo methods, and it feels that the more I study the less I truly understand the theory. I guess I just confuse myself now. So the expected value of a random variable X is: $E[X] = \int x_i p(x_i)\:dx$ where X is is random variable and p(x) is the pdf of X. This sort of makes sense to me especially of you think in terms of discrete random variable. If an outcome is more likely to be drawn than others, then the pdf for this outcome $x_i$ accounts for this.I have a problem when this apply to a function. So we have: $E[f(x)] = \int f(x_i) p(x_i) \: dx$ My understanding here is that f can be any sort of function we like. $x_i$ is a possible value from the random variable X and $p(x_i)$ is the probability distribution. Because $x_i$ is random $f(x_i)$ is random. So f(x) is a function of the random variable X. Now what I don't understand with this: doesn't the result of the expected value E[f(x)] depends on the choice of the pdf? For example of you have a simple function such as f(x) = x (imagine the integration domain is [0,1]), if you choose a uniform pdf or a gaussian distribution, wouldn't the result of E[f(x)] be different? I am sure I am just mixing in my mind ""simple"" concepts. I am probably not thinking this problem the right way. If anybody could straighten that up for me, it would be great. EDIT Thank you for your answers. So it seems my question wasn't clear enough and complete. From the answer you gave me, I understand that: X is distributed according to a give distribution (in other words, X and its PDF are interdependent). therefore indeed changing X, implies that the distribution has changed as well and yes, E[f(X)] is likely to be different for different Xs. I think my confusion comes partly from the fact this PDF plays a role in the computation of the Monte Carlo integral and particular the general form in which the integrand is divided by the PDF: $E[f(X)] \approx { 1 \over N } \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} { f(x_i) \over p(x_i) }.$ where $x_i$ is a sequence of random numbers drawn from a random variable X with distribution p(X). We are trying to approximate: $F = \int f(x)\:dx.$ We know the result of this MC integral converges in probability to the expected value E[f(X)]. So according to the three points I listed above, wouldn't changing X and its PDF give a different result for E[f(x)] when MC integration is used? When you measure the area ""under"" (a way of interpreting what an integral is) the curve, that area is constant. So if we get a different E[f(x)] for something that should always be the same, what I am missing? In other words, in a lot of books $E[f(X)] = \int f(X) p(X) \: dx$ is presented as ""the formula"" to calculate the expected value of f. This seems like misleading to me. Should it be more accurate to say ""the expected value of f given the particular random variable X with PDF p(X)""? , knowing that if we change X we will get a different E[f(X)].","['probability-theory', 'integration', 'random-variables']"
842176,How to integrate: $\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{tx}(x^2e^{-x})/2dx$,"I'm working on a few moment generating function problems and I came across: $f(x)=(x^2e^{-x})/2$ for $x>0$, and zero otherwise. Find the mean. The mean is the same as the expected value. If we find the moment generating function, $M_x(t)$, of $f(x)$ then we can take the first derivative of $M_x(t)$ at $t=0$. This will give us the mean. To find the $M_x(t)$ we take $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{tx}f(x)dx$$ $$\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{tx}(x^2e^{-x})/2dx$$ I wrote this as: $$\frac12\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{2}e^{x(t-1)}dx$$ I'm a bit rusty on integration and if someone could help point me in the right direction as to how to tackle this guy I would greatly appreciate it!","['moment-generating-functions', 'calculus', 'probability', 'integration']"

I did a thorough search on Stack Exchange and could not find a similar problem.  I was wondering if anyone could help me verify my proof.  Some background: $$s,t \in \Bbb Q, \quad s^âˆ— = \{r \in \Bbb Q : r < s\}$$ is a Dedekind cut where $s$ is in $\Bbb Q$.  So, it is a rational Dedekind cut. $t^*$ is defined similarly. $$(s+t)^* = \{r âˆˆ \Bbb Q : r < s + t\}$$ $$s^* + t^* = \{r1 + r2 : r_1 \in s^* \text{ and} r_2 âˆˆ t^*\}$$ So, to show that $s^* + t^*$ is a subset of $(s+t)^*$ is quite easy.  To show $(s+t)^* \subseteq s^* + t^*$ was quite difficult for me.  But, I think I have it now.  Here goes. Suppose $x âˆˆ (s+t)^*$.  Then, $x âˆˆ \Bbb Q$ and $x < s + t$.  By the density of $\Bbb Q$, there is an $m$ in $\Bbb Q$ such that $x < m < s + t$.  Let $\varepsilon = m - x$.  So, $x < x + \varepsilon < s + t$.  So, $x + \varepsilon - s < t$. Define $x$ as follows: $$x = (s-Ïµ) + (t - (t - x + (s-\varepsilon))). $$ Clearly, $s-\varepsilon < s$.  Since $s-\varepsilon âˆˆ \Bbb Q, s-\varepsilon âˆˆ s^*$ .  Likewise, $$(t - (t - x + (s-\varepsilon))) = x - s + \varepsilon < t.$$  Since $(t - (t - x + (s-\varepsilon))) âˆˆ \Bbb Q$ and $(t - (t - x + (s-\varepsilon))) < t, (t - (t - x + (s-\varepsilon))) âˆˆ t^*$. Hence, $x = r_1 + r_2$ such that $r_1 âˆˆ s^*$ and $r_2 âˆˆ t^*$.  Thus, $x âˆˆ s^* + t^*$ and $(s+t)^* \subseteq s^* + t^*$ Is this proof valid?","['proof-verification', 'elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"

842468,Random $0-1$ matrices,"I'm working my way through the Oxford notes in Probabilistic Combinatorics and came across this question in one of the question sheets; I'd like to stress that this is not my homework: I'm simply working through the notes for my own pleasure. For $n, r âˆˆ \mathbb{N}$, $1 < r < n$, let $z(r, n)$ be the largest possible number of $0$ entries in an $n Ã— n$ matrix which has no $r Ã— r$ submatrix whose entries are all $0$. (Here a submatrix is obtained by selecting any $r$ rows and any $r$ columns; the rows/columns need not be consecutive.) Consider a random matrix in which each entry is $0$ with probability $p$ and $1$ with
probability $1âˆ’p$, independently. Deduce that $z(r, n) > pn^{2}-p^{r^{2}}n^{2r}.$ My solution: Let $[n]_{2}$ denote the set of all $n \times n$ matrices, with only $0-1$ entries. For each $\sigma \in [n]_{2}$ let the random variable $X(\sigma)$ denote the number of $0$ entries in $\sigma$ and the random variable $Y(\sigma)$ denote the number of $r \times r$ submatrices filled with entirely with $0$'s. It follows that $\mathbb{E}(X)=pn^{{2}}$ and $\mathbb{E}(Y)=\binom{n}{r}^{2}p^{r^{2}}<n^{2r}p^{r^{2}}$. Further more consider the random variable $X-Y$ for which $\mathbb{E}(X-Y)>pn^{2}-n^{2r}p^{r^{2}}$. It follows that there exists a $\sigma \in [n]_{2}$ such that $X(\sigma)-Y(\sigma)>pn^{2}-n^{2r}p^{r^{2}}$. Given such a $\sigma$ construct $\sigma' \in [n]_{2}$ as follows. For each of the all $0$, $r \times r$ sub matrices of $\sigma$ remove at random a single $0$ from each to ensure $\sigma'$ has no $r \times r$ such sub-matrices. We have removed at most $\binom{n}{r}^{2}<n^{2r}$ such zero's and so we can conclude that $\sigma'$ has at least $pn^{2}-p^{r^{2}}n^{2r}$ zeros thus we can conclude that $z(n,r)>pn^{2}-p^{r^{2}}n^{2r}$.

842604,"Given every horse's probability of winning a race, what is the probability that a specific horse will finish 2nd and 3rd?","This question is a follow-on from this question . I am trying to determine the probability of each horse finishing 2nd and each horse finishing 3rd. I have developed code to calculate the probabilities by implementing the formulas provided in the above mentioned question.

All of the HorseData objects are contained in a List called hdList. The following code implements the formula:
$$
P(i,2)= \sum_{i \neq x} (P_x . \frac {P_i}{(1 - P_x)  })

Suppose there are two subsequences: $a_{n_l}, \ a_{n_k}$ such that $\lim a_{n_k} = k, \ \lim a_{n_l}=l$ and suppose $l\le k$, so $\lim \frac 1 {a_{n_k}}=\frac 1 k , \ \lim \frac 1 {a_{n_l}}=\frac 1 l$ so clearly: $\frac 1 k\le \frac 1 l\le l\le k$ so it's easy to see once the largest limit (supermum) is 'inverted' it has to become the smallest limit (infimum). I realize this doesn't show equality, I don't know how to do the other way and I'm not even sure if what I did is good. If $a_n$ converges, suppose to $L$ as its limit then we have: $L\cdot \frac 1 L=1$. If it does not converge then $a_n$ may tend to infinity or won't have a limit. From 1 we can change it to $\displaystyle\limsup_{n\to\infty}a_n\cdot \frac 1 {\displaystyle\liminf_{n\to\infty}a_n} \ge 1$ and from BW, every sequence has a converging subsequence, and since for converging subsequences: $\liminf a_n\le \limsup a_n$ we have $\frac {\limsup a_n} {\liminf a_n}=\limsup a_n\cdot \limsup\frac 1 {a_n} \ge 1$.

842796,Advice for self-studying Inequalities and Calculus,"I'm interested in self-studying the following books over the next year or so: Spivak's Calculus (I'm already in Ch. 5 and it is very slow going) The Cauchy-Schwarz Master Class by J. Michael Steele Analytic Inequalities by Nicholas Kazarinoff My goal in studying these books is to gain a deeper understanding of calculus, basic real analysis, and manipulations of the standard inequalities, with the ultimate goal of understanding derivations, approximations, and inequalities in probability and statistics (Stirling's approximation, Wallis product, Gamma Function, Normal Distribution, Limit Theorems etc).  One of the things I realized when I first started studying Spivak's Calculus is that I have had very little experience in solving challenging problems.  I have never had any issues with doing 'Exercises' in the standard engineering style calculus text books, but I am often at a loss of ideas when I do problems in Spivak. My questions are the following: Before progressing through Spivak, should I go through a book like Art and Craft of Problem Solving by Paul Zeitz? I guess the point of doing this would be to beef up my problem-solving skills. I should note that I am not very excited about working through the Art and Craft of Problem Solving because a lot of it seems geared toward solving Olympiad geometry problems.  I've never had a solid geometry course, so at this point I feel like it might just be a waste of time trying to learn plane geometry. Should I relearn high school mathematics? To be perfectly honest, I feel robbed by my entire education and I'm very disappointed by my lack of foresight up to this point. I've always used easy textbooks(not my choice) in my college calculus, Linear algebra, and ODE and PDE classes and believed 'good grades' were enough. Or, should I just keep a copy of Polya's Heuristics on hand while I patiently work through Spivak? I'm just looking for a bit of advise on the wisest way to proceed.

842801,Topology: Opens vs Neighborhoods,"Disclaimer: This thread is meant informative and therefore written in Q&A style. The problems are highlighted in bold face. The axiomatization of topology can be done in various ways all of them having their own advantage. Here I would like to investigate two of them specifically. There's the one by open sets usually given:
$$\bullet \#I<\infty:\quad A_i\in\mathcal{T}\implies \bigcap_{i\in I}A\in\mathcal{T}\\
\bullet \#I\leq\infty:\quad A_i\in\mathcal{T}\implies\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i\in\mathcal{T}$$
and the one by neighborhoods introduced by Felix Hausdorff:
$$\bullet A\subseteq B:\quad A\in\mathcal{N}(x)\implies B\in\mathcal{N}(x)\\
\bullet A,B\in\mathcal{N}(x)\implies A\cap B\in\mathcal{N}(x)\\
\bullet \forall x\in X:\quad\mathcal{N}(x)\neq\{\}\\
\bullet A\in\mathcal{N}(x)\implies x\in A\\
\bullet A\in\mathcal{N}(x)\implies\exists C_0\in\mathcal{N}:\quad A\in\mathcal{N}(c)\text{ for all }c\in C_0(x)$$ Prove that any family of open sets give rise to a neighborhood system via: $$A\in\mathcal{N_T}(x):\iff\exists U_0\in\mathcal{T}:\quad x\in U_0\subseteq A\quad$$ and that any neighborhood system gives rise to a family of open sets via: $$A\in\mathcal{T_N}:\iff\forall a\in A:\quad A\in\mathcal{N}(a)$$ Moreover prove that their equivalent in the sense: $$\mathcal{T}\mapsto\mathcal{N_T}\mapsto\mathcal{T}\text{ and }\mathcal{N}\mapsto\mathcal{T_N}\mapsto\mathcal{N}$$
(Note that both must be checked in order to ensure injectivity and surjectivity.) So we can switch back and forth between both descriptions for topology. Here are two situations where this is exploited: a. The interior is defined via neighborhoods:
$$A^\circ:=\{z:A\in\mathcal{N}(z)\}$$
It is contained and open (see Topology: Interior ):
$$A^\circ\subseteq A\text{ and }A^\circ\in\mathcal{N}(z)\text{ for all }z\in A^\circ$$
Therefore neighborhoods have nonempty interior:
$$A^\circ=\bigcup_{A\supseteq U\in\mathcal{T}}U$$
b. Continuity is defined via neighborhoods:
$$N\in\mathcal{N}(f(x))\implies f^{-1}N\in\mathcal{N}(x)$$
Thus in locally convex spaces topology is entailed fully in any point:
$$N\in\mathcal{N}(x)\iff N+a\in\mathcal{N}(x+a)$$ So while open sets reflect general aspects of topology correlations between space itself and topology become lucid via neighborhoods.","['general-topology', 'axioms', 'continuity', 'definition']"

In particular, the last few steps.  The proof is as follows: Theorem. $\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1 + \frac1n \right)^n = e.$ Proof. Let $$s_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{k!}, \qquad t_n = \left(1 + \frac1n \right)^n.$$ By the binomial theorem, $$t_n = 1 + 1 + \frac1{2!}\left( 1 - \frac1n \right) + \frac1{3!}\left(1 - \frac1n \right)\left(1 - \frac2n \right) + \dots \\ + \frac1{n!}\left(1 - \frac1n \right)\left(1 - \frac2n \right)\dots\left(1-\frac{n-1}{n}\right).$$ Hence $t_n \leq s_n$, so that $$\limsup_{n\to\infty} t_n \leq e, 
\tag{14}$$ by Theorem 3.19. Next, if $n \geq m$, $$t_n \geq 1 + 1 + \frac1{2!}\left(1-\frac1n\right) + \dots + \frac1{m!}\left(1-\frac1n\right)\dots\left(1-\frac{m-1}{n}\right).$$ Let $n\to\infty$, keeping $m$ fixed. We get $$\liminf_{n\to\infty} t_n \geq 1 + 1 + \frac1{2!} + \dots + \frac1{m!},$$ so that $$s_m \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty} t_n.$$ Letting $m\to\infty$, we finally get $$e \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty} t_n. \tag{15}$$ The theorem follows from (14) and (15). (original image) My question: What allows us to say that $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\text{inf } t_{n} \geq s_{m}?$$ I see that $\lim_{n\to \infty}t_{n} \geq s_{m}$ (if it exists, I suppose otherwise it's vacuously true...), but why the $\liminf$?

842846,Finite Subgroups of $GL_2(\mathbb Q)$,"I want to prove that the only finite subgroups of $GL_2(\mathbb Q)$ are $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_6, V_4, D_6, D_8,$ and $D_{12}$. First, we determine all possible finite orders of elements. Now, an element of order $n$ will have a minimal polynomial that divides $x^n-1$, so its (complex) roots will be distinct, and so the matrix will be diagonalizable over $\mathbb C$. This implies that both eigenvalues are $n$th roots of unity, and that at least one is primitive, and so the minimal polynomial will be the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial. But since the minimal polynomial can only have degree $1$ or $2$, since we're dealing with $2\times 2$ matrices, the only possible orders are those $n$ for which $\phi(n)=1$ or $2$, so the only possible orders are $1, 2, 3, 4$, and $6$.  Thus, if $G$ is a finite subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb Q)$, then $|G|=2^a3^b$. Now, since $G$ contains a Sylow-$3$ of order $3^b$, and any $3$-group contains subgroups of every possible order, once we show that $C_3\times C_3$ is not a subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb Q)$, then we can conclude that $b=0$ or $1$, since we already saw that $C_9$ cannot be a subgroup. WLOG, let $g=\begin{bmatrix} 0&-1\\1&-1\end{bmatrix}$, which is the Rational Canonical Form for the minimal polynomial $x^2+x+1$, and so has order $3$. We seek to show that there is no matrix $h$ such that $h$ has order $3$, commutes with $g$, and isn't a power of $g$. So assume $h=\begin{bmatrix} a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}$. Then $gh=\begin{bmatrix} -c&-d\\a-c&b-d\end{bmatrix}$ and $hg=\begin{bmatrix} b&-(a+b)\\d&-(c+d)\end{bmatrix}$. Equating these, we get that $c=-b, d=a+b$, so $h=\begin{bmatrix} a&b\\-b&a+b\end{bmatrix}$. For $h$ to have order $3$, the trace must be $-1$, and the determinant must be $1$, just like in the Rational Canonical Form, so $2a+b=1$, and $a^2+ab+b^2=1$. The solutions are $a=-1, b=1$ and $a=0, b=-1$. The latter gives $h=g$ and the former gives $h=g^2$, and so there can be no subgroup isomorphic to $C_3\times C_3$, and thus $9$ does not divide the order of the group. Now, the next step would be to restrict the exponent of $2$, but I'm not quite sure how to do this. One part of the problem tells me to show that the only noncyclic abelian subgroup is $V_4$, the Klein-$4$ group. So if we let $g=\begin{bmatrix} 0&1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}$ be the RCF of $x+1$, then the only order $2$ matrices that commute with it are $-g$ and $-g^2=-I$, which form a Klein-$4$ group. This means that $C_2^3$ is not a subgroup. Also, if we get $g=\begin{bmatrix} 0&-1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}$ be the RCF of $x^2+1$, then the only order $2$ element that commutes with it is $-I=g^2$, so there is also no subgroup isomorphic to $C_4\times C_2$. In a previous exercise, I showed that $Q_8$ is not a subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb R)$, and thus isn't a subgroup over $\mathbb Q$ either. But this doesn't seem to prevent subgroups of order $16$, since $D_8$ is in fact a subgroup. Checking all $14$ groups of order $16$, it seems that all of them have an order $8$ subgroup besides $D_8$, but is there a cleaner way to rule out groups of order $16$ without classifying them, since I'm apparently supposed to conclude that the order of $G$ divides $24=2^3\cdot 3$ from the fact that the Klein-$4$ group is the only noncyclic abelian subgroup. So now, if I assume as known that $24$ divides the order of $G$, then the possible orders for $G$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12$, and $24$. I can find $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_6, V_4, D_6, D_8,$ and $D_{12}$. This takes care of all the orders except $12$ and $24$. I can show that $C_{12}$ and $C_{6}\times C_2$ are not subgroups, but I'm not sure how to rule out the nonabelian groups of order 12, $A_4$ and $C_3\rtimes C_4$, or the groups of order $24$. So in summary, I'm a bit stuck in ruling out the nonabelian groups of order $12, 16,$ and $24$. Is there a more elegant way to do this than to look at the classifications of these groups and find subgroups which I have already shown to be impossible?","['linear-algebra', 'group-theory']"

  arrangements possible. Case 2 : 1 friend for 3 nights, 1 friend for 1 night, 1 friend for 1 night If $f_1$ eats dinner at the house 3 nights, we have $f_2$ one night, $f_3$ one night.

Edit 1 Another approach,
Using Morera's theorem,
$\int_{\gamma}\int_0^1F(z,t)dtdz=0$ for any closed curve $\gamma$. Since $F(z,t)$ is uniformly continuous, we can switch the integral and get the result.
Is this right? Can we switch the integral? Edit 2 Second part: Let $t\in [0,1]$ and let $\{t_n\}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $t_n\rightarrow t$ uniformly. $lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}F(z,t_n)=F(z,t)$ uniformly since $F$ is uniformly continuous in $t\in[0,1]$ Then we have:

$\sin x \le x \implies \frac {\sin x}{x}\le 1$ 
So define: 
$f(x)=\sin x, \ g(x)=x$ then from CMVT: 
$\dfrac {f(\frac {\pi} 2)}{g(\frac {\pi} 2)}=\dfrac {f'(c)} {g'(c)}=\cos c$

$\frac2\pi x \le \sin x\implies \frac {2x}{\pi\sin x}\le 1$
So: 
$\dfrac {f(\frac {\pi} 2)}{g(\frac {\pi} 2)}=\dfrac {f'(c)} {g'(c)}\implies\frac {1}{\sin {\frac {\pi}{2}}}=\frac {2}{\pi \cos c}$
 Here actually 
$\frac {1}{\sin {\frac {\pi}{2}}}=1$ so it's also $\le 1$ Is it correct to use CMVT like this ?

842989,The completeness assumption in Prokhorov's theorem,"Originally, I encountered this question on Terence Tao's blog , where the following exercise is presented: Exercise 23 (Implications and equivalences) Let $X_n, X$ be random variables taking values in a $\sigma$compact metric space $R$. [...] (ii) Show that if $X_n$ converges in distribution to $X$, then $X_n$ has a tight sequence of distributions. (iii) Show that if $X_n$ converges in probability to $X$, then $X_n$ converges in distribution to $X$. (Hint: first show tightness, then use the fact that on compact sets, continuous functions are uniformly continuous.) Whats struck me as odd was that $R$ is merely assumed to be $\sigma$-compact, i.e. no completeness-assumption on $R$ is made (as the example $\Bbb{Q}$ shows, there are $\sigma$-compact spaces that are neither locally compact, nor complete). This makes it rather hard to construct new compact subsets (from old ones). Indeed, the proofs of the above statement (ii) that I found (see e.g. https://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~vangaans/jancol1.pdf Theorem 5.2) use the fact that $$
K := \bigcap_j \bigcup_{i=1}^{k_j} \overline{B}(a_i, 1/j)
$$
is a compact set if $R$ is complete , because it is closed and totally bounded. Nevertheless, Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokhorov%27s_theorem ) does also not assume that the metric space in question is complete, there the only requirement is separability. Note that we need to produce compact subsets of $R$, because for tightness (see below), we have to show that for $\varepsilon > 0$ there is $K \subset R$ compact such that $\Bbb{P}(X_n \in K) \geq 1-\varepsilon$ holds for all $n$ sufficiently large. In summary , my question is if the two statements as in the exercise above are correct even without further completeness assumptions on $R$. Hints/proofs/counterexamples would be highly appreciated. For convenience of the reader, I repeat the necessary definitions below: Definition 10 (Modes of convergence) Let $R = (R,d)$ be a $\sigma$-compact metric space (with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra), and let $X_n$ be a sequence of random variables taking values in $R$.

843576,Finding all the values of $\theta$ for which $\tan(\theta)=\sqrt3$; problem with understanding.,"My textbook has a section where it says a possible way that $\tan(\theta)$ can be thought of is: For acute angles $\theta$, $\tan(\theta)$ is the $y$-coordinate of the point on the terminal side of $\theta$ which lies on the vertical line $x=1$, which is tangent to the Unit Circle. It also provides an illustration which I particularly like as it provides me with some intuition as to where the tangent function is in relation with sine and cosine on the Unit Circle: Bearing this in mind I am then asked to find all the possible angles which satisfy the following equation: $\tan(\theta)=\sqrt3$. I know from memory that $\tan(\theta)=\sqrt3$ for one of the common angles $60^\circ$ or $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians. All other solutions in quadrant I must be coterminal with this angle so I state simply: $\theta=\frac{\pi}{3}+2\pi k$ where $k$ is an integer. However the answer states another solution is to be found in the third quadrant that is given by $\theta=\frac{4\pi}{3}+2\pi k$ for integers $k$. And as $\tan(\theta)$ is periodic every $\pi$ radians a simplified formula for all solutions is given by: $\theta=\frac{\pi}{3}+\pi k$ for integers $k$. My confusion arises from the above diagram. According to this diagram: It is not possible for $\theta$ to be a quadrant III angle, as the terminal side of $\theta$ will never intersect the vertical line $x=1$, as illustrated by this rudimentary picture below: Furthermore it is not possible for $\tan\theta=\sqrt 3$ in the third quadrant where $\theta=\frac{4\pi}{3}$ as the terminal side of the angle will not be able to intersect $y=\sqrt 3$. What have I misunderstood? 
How is it possible to retain the intuition from this diagram and apply it to angles that are greater than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians? Any answers should be written with the knowledge that I am a precalculus student.
