3481810,An inequality on the roots of a transcendental equation,"Denote the two real roots of $x-\ln x=a(a> 1)$ as $x_1,x_2$ . Show that $x_1+x_2\leq a+\sqrt{a}$ . If we introduce Lambert W function , we can express the roots as $$x_1=-W_{-1}(-e^{-a}),~~~~x_2=-W(-e^{-a}).\\$$ Thus we only need to show $$f(a)=-W_{-1}(-e^{-a})-W(-e^{-a})-a-\sqrt{a}\leq 0.$$ By graphing the function , we can see $f(a)$ is a decreasing function, thus $f(a)\leq f(1)=0,$ which is what we want. But how to prove this rigorously?","['calculus', 'functions', 'inequality']"
3481858,Get statistical significance from the likelihood and so from the posterior (in anisotropy expansion),"I try to understand, from a technical point of view, how are computed the statistical significance from a Bayesian study (I guess) in this abstract below 
from article "" Evidence for anisotropy of cosmic acceleration ""
by Jacques Colin, Roya Mohayaee, Mohamed Rameez, Subir Sarkar: Observations reveal a 'bulk flow' in the local Universe which is
   faster and extends to much larger scales than is expected around
   a typical observer in  the standard ΛCDM cosmology. This is expected
   to result in a scale-dependent dipolar modulation of the acceleration
   of the expansion rate inferred from observations of objects within
   the bulk flow. From a maximum-likelihood analysis  of the Joint
   Lightcurve Analysis (JLA) catalogue of Type Ia supernovae we find
   that the deceleration parameter, in addition to a small monopole,
   indeed has a much bigger dipole component aligned with the CMB
   dipole which falls exponentially  with redshift $z$ : $q_0=q_m+\vec{q}_d\cdot \hat{n}\exp(−z/S)$ .
   The best fit to data yields $q_d=−8.03$ and $S=0.0262$ ( $⇒d∼100 \text{Mpc}$ ), rejecting isotropy ( $q_d=0$ ) with $3.9\sigma$ statistical significance,  while $q_m=−0.157$ and
   consistent with no acceleration ( $q_m=0$ ) at $1.4\sigma$ .
   Thus the cosmic acceleration deduced from supernovae may be an
   artefact of our being non-Copernican observers, rather than
   evidence for a dominant component  of 'dark energy' in the Universe. Indeed, I have few notions like the relation : $$\text{posterior}=\frac{\text{likelihood}\times\text{prior}}{\text{evidence}}$$ using likelihood or more classically : $$p(\theta|d)=\frac{p(d|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(d)}$$ with $\theta$ are the parameters to estimate and $d$ are the data. I would like to understand how the statistical significance announced (the first one $= 3.9 \sigma$ ) is computed from the Bayesian relations above. I think this is computed from the posterior but how to get this value : they estimate from the likelihood at $d_d = -8.03$ and $S = 0.0262$ : how to compute this $3.9 \sigma$ ? Do they use the MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimator)  or MAP (Maximum Aposteriori Probability) methods ? I hope you will understand my issue of understanding since I am interested into the necessity to introduce a cosmological constant or not into standard model. Any explanations are welcome.

3481897,Solving a first Order ordinary differential equation with only linear terms,"The following problem is from the book ""Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations"" By Sheply L. Ross. It is problem 8 in section 2.4. It can be found on page 67. I believe I have the wrong answer. Where did I go wrong? Problem: Solve the following differential equations. $$ ( 3x - y + 1 ) dx - ( 6x - 2y - 3) dy = 0 $$ Answer: I am going to use the substitution $z = 3x -y + 1$ . \begin{align*}
\frac{dz}{dx} &= 3 -  \frac{dy}{dx} \\
dz &= 3 \, dx - dy \\
- dy &= dz - 3 dx \\
dy &= 3 dx - dz \\
z \, dx - ( 6x - 2y - 3) \left( 3 dx - dz \right)  = 0 \\
z \, dx - ( 6x - 2y + 2 - 5) \left( 3 dx - dz \right)  = 0 \\
z \, dx - ( 2z - 5) \left( 3 dx - dz \right)  = 0 \\
z \, dx + (-2z + 5)(3 \, dx - dz) &= 0 \\
(z - 6z + 15)\, dx + (2z-5) dz &= 0 \\
dx + \frac{2z-5 }{-5z + 15 } \, dz &= 0 \\
dx - \frac{2z-5 }{5z - 15 } \, dz &= 0 
\end{align*} Now we need to perform the following integration: $$ I = \int \frac{2z-5 }{5z - 15 } \, dz $$ To perform this integration, I use the substitution $u = 5z - 15$ which gives me $du = 5 \, dz$ . \begin{align*}
I &= \int \frac{ \left( 2z - 5 \right) \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) } {u} \, du \\
5z &= u + 15 \\
z &= \frac{u+15}{5} \\
I &= \int \frac{ \left( 2 \left( \frac{u+15}{5} \right)  - 5 \right) \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) } {u} \, du \\
I &= \frac{1}{5} \int \frac{\frac{2u+15} {5} -  5} {u} \, du \\
I &= \frac{1}{5} \int \frac{ \frac{2u + 15 - 25} { 5} } { u } \, du \\
I &= \frac{1}{25} \int \frac{ 2u - 10 }{u} \, du \\
I &= \frac{2u}{25} - \frac{10}{25}  \ln{|u|} + C_1 \\
I &= \frac{1}{25} \left( 2( 5z - 15) \right) - \frac{2}{5} \ln{|5z - 15|} + C_1 \\
x &= \frac{1}{25} \left( 2( 5z - 15) \right) - \frac{2}{5} \ln{|5z - 15|} + C_1 \\
5x &= \frac{1}{5} \left( 2( 5z - 15) \right) - 2 \ln{|5z - 15|} + C \text{ with } C = 5C_1 \\
5x &= \frac{1}{5} \left( 2( 5(3x -y + 1) - 15) \right) - 2 \ln{|5(3x -y + 1) - 15|} + C \\
5x &= \frac{1}{5} \left( 2( 15x -5y + 5 - 15) \right) - 2 \ln{|15x - 5y + 5 - 15|} + C \\
5x &= \frac{1}{5} \left( 30x - 10y - 20 \right) - 2 \ln{|15x - 5y - 10|} + C \\
5x &= \left( 6x - 2y - 4 \right) - 2 \ln{|15x - 5y - 10|} + C
\end{align*} Now, I am going to check the answer by differentiating it. \begin{align*}
5 &= 6 - 2 \frac{dy}{dx} - 2 \frac{15 - 5 \frac{dy}{dx}}{15x - 5y - 10} \\
-1 &= - 2 \frac{dy}{dx} - 2 \frac{15 - 5 \frac{dy}{dx}}{15x - 5y - 10} \\
1 &=  2 \frac{dy}{dx} + 2 \frac{15 - 5 \frac{dy}{dx}}{15x - 5y - 10} \\
15x - 5y - 10 &=  2 (15x - 5y - 10) \frac{dy}{dx} + 2  (15 - 5 \frac{dy}{dx}) \\
15x - 5y - 10 &=  2 (15x - 5y - 10) \frac{dy}{dx} +  30 - 10 \frac{dy}{dx} \\
15x - 5y - 40 &=  2 (15x - 5y - 10) \frac{dy}{dx} - 10 \frac{dy}{dx} \\
15x - 5y - 40 &= ( 30x - 10y - 20) \frac{dy}{dx} \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{15x - 5y - 40}{30x - 10y - 20} \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{ 3x - y + 8 } { 6x - 2y - 4 }
\end{align*} Hence the answer does not check. Based upon the comment I got from N74 I have updated my answer. I feel I am closer to the correct solution but I am still off. I am going to use the substitution $z = 3x -y + 1$ . \begin{align*}
\frac{dz}{dx} &= 3 -  \frac{dy}{dx} \\
dz &= 3 \, dx - dy \\
- dy &= dz - 3 dx \\
dy &= 3 dx - dz \\
z \, dx - ( 6x - 2y - 3) \left( 3 dx - dz \right)  = 0 \\
z \, dx - ( 6x - 2y + 2 - 5) \left( 3 dx - dz \right)  = 0 \\
z \, dx - ( 2z - 5) \left( 3 dx - dz \right)  = 0 \\
z \, dx + (-2z + 5)(3 \, dx - dz) &= 0 \\
(z - 6z + 15)\, dx + (2z-5) dz &= 0 \\
dx + \frac{2z-5 }{-5z + 15 } \, dz &= 0 \\
dx - \frac{2z-5 }{5z - 15 } \, dz &= 0 
\end{align*} Now we need to perform the following integration: $$ I = \int \frac{2z-5 }{5z - 15 } \, dz $$ To perform this integration, I use the substitution $u = 5z - 15$ which gives me $du = 5 \, dz$ . \begin{align*}
I &= \int \frac{ \left( 2z - 5 \right) \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) } {u} \, du \\
5z &= u + 15 \\
z &= \frac{u+15}{5} \\
I &= \int \frac{ \left( 2 \left( \frac{u+15}{5} \right)  - 5 \right) \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) } {u} \, du \\
I &= \frac{1}{5} \int \frac{\frac{2u+30} {5} -  5} {u} \, du \\
I &= \frac{1}{5} \int \frac{ \frac{2u + 30 - 25} { 5} } { u } \, du \\
I &= \frac{1}{25} \int \frac{ 2u + 5 }{u} \, du \\
I &= \frac{2u}{25} + \frac{5}{25}  \ln{|u|} + C_1 \\
I &= \frac{1}{25} \left( 2( 5z - 15) \right) + \frac{1}{5} \ln{|5z - 15|} + C_1 \\
x &= \frac{1}{25} \left( 2( 5z - 15) \right) + \frac{1}{5} \ln{|5z - 15|} + C_1 \\
5x &= \frac{1}{5} \left( 2( 5z - 15) \right) + \ln{|5z - 15|} + C \text{ with } C = 5C_1 \\
5x &= \frac{1}{5} \left( 2( 5(3x -y + 1) - 15) \right) + \ln{|5(3x -y + 1) - 15|} + C \\
5x &= \frac{1}{5} \left( 2( 15x -5y + 5 - 15) \right) + \ln{|15x - 5y + 5 - 15|} + C \\
5x &= \frac{1}{5} \left( 30x - 10y - 20 \right) + \ln{|15x - 5y - 10|} + C \\
5x &= \left( 6x - 2y - 4 \right) + \ln{|15x - 5y - 10|} + C
\end{align*} Now, I am going to check the answer by differentiating it. \begin{align*}
5 &= 6 - 2 \frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{15 - 5 \frac{dy}{dx}}{15x - 5y - 10} \\
-1 &= - 2 \frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{15 - 5 \frac{dy}{dx}}{15x - 5y - 10} \\
%
1 &=  2 \frac{dy}{dx} - \frac{15 - 5 \frac{dy}{dx}}{15x - 5y - 10} \\
15x - 5y - 10 &= 2(15x - 5y - 10) \frac{dy}{dx} - 15 - 5 \frac{dy}{dx} \\
15x - 5y + 5 &= ( 30x - 10y - 20 - 5 ) \frac{dy}{dx} \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{ 15x - 5y + 5 } { 30x - 10y - 25 } = \frac{ 3x - y + 1}{ 6x - 2y - 5} \\
(3x - y + 1) \, dx &= ( 6x - 2y - 5 ) \, dy \\
\end{align*} Hence the answer does not check. I now believe that my second answer is correct. The check I did above is not right. Here is my updated check of the answer I got. Now, I am going to check the answer by differentiating it. \begin{align*}
5 &= 6 - 2 \frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{15 - 5 \frac{dy}{dx}}{15x - 5y - 10} \\
-1 &= - 2 \frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{15 - 5 \frac{dy}{dx}}{15x - 5y - 10} \\
%
1 &=  2 \frac{dy}{dx} - \frac{15 - 5 \frac{dy}{dx}}{15x - 5y - 10} \\
%
15x - 5y - 10 &= 5y - 10 &= 2(15x - 5y - 10)\frac{dy}{dx} + 5 \frac{dy}{dx}- 15 \\
15x - 5y + 5 &= (30x - 10y - 20)\frac{dy}{dx} + 5 + \frac{dy}{dx} \\
3x - y + 1 &= (6x - 2y - 4)\frac{dy}{dx} + 5 \frac{dy}{dx} \\
3x - y + 1 &= (6x - 2y +1 )\frac{dy}{dx} \\
(3x-y+1) dx &= (6x-2y+1) dy
\end{align*} Hence the answer checks.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
3481899,Simple proof of $A_n$ being simple?,"I come across an incomplete proof of the simplicity of $A_n,n\geq 5$ , in a textbook. The proof looks simple, so I was attracted to it. Here is the proof after I filled in the details. Everything in $A_n$ can be generated by $3$ -cycles. To see this, just note that $$
(12)(13)=(123),(13)(24)=(123)(234).
$$ We now show that every non-trivial normal subgroup of $A_n$ contains a $3$ -cycle. Let $\alpha\in A_n$ be an element which permutes the least number of elements in $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ . We show that $\alpha$ is a $3$ -cycle. $\alpha$ cannot be the product of two disjoint order 2 cycles since if $\alpha=(12)(34), \beta=(345)$ , then $\beta^{-1}\alpha^{-1}\beta\alpha=(345)$ , contradicting the minimality of $\alpha$ .
  If $\alpha=(12)(34)(56)$ , let $\beta=(123)$ . In general, $\alpha$ can not be the product of disjoint order 2 cycles. Now, we know that the only two cases are $$
\alpha=(1234...)\text{ or } \alpha(123)(45...)
$$ the former one must permute at least $5$ elements; the later must permute at least $6$ elements. However, in the former case let $\beta=(234)$ and in the latter case let $\beta=(132)$ . Calculating $\beta^{-1}\alpha^{-1}\beta\alpha$ in both cases gives $(143)$ and $(15324)$ , which leads to a contradiction, because they permute less elements than $\alpha$ . Finally, note that any two 3-cycles are conjugate to each other. So any normal subgroup is the entire $A_n$ . My question is: although this proof is significantly shorter than the other ones I see, I find it quite difficult to understand how those permutations (such as $\beta=(132)$ in the end) are chosen. Why are we interested in the commutator $\beta^{-1}\alpha^{-1}\beta\alpha$ ? It makes sense to consider $\beta^{-1}\alpha\beta$ since it is related to the definition of normal subgroups. So, why we consider $\beta^{-1}\alpha^{-1}\beta\alpha$ instead? How can we choose an appropriate $\beta$ when we cannot remember the details of this proof? For example, why choose $\beta=(132)$ and $\beta=(234)$ at last? Do we really need to try all possible $\beta$ one by one?","['permutations', 'permutation-cycles', 'simple-groups', 'symmetric-groups', 'group-theory']"

So we first need to look at the pre image of the functions, the functions is continuous so by definition $$|f_n(x)-0|< \varepsilon\Rightarrow |f_n(x)|<\varepsilon$$ So $$A=\{x:|f_n(x)|< \varepsilon\}$$ let $f_n(x)\in E\subset [0,1]$ be an open group, then pre image of $E$ is open and $A$ is an open set and therefore $A\in B([0,1])$ Now there is a hint to use intersection and unions, which are called $G_\delta, G_\sigma$ , how can it be used to prove the claim? and is my first reasoning is correct?",['measure-theory']

What is the transformation from $f(x,y)$ to $g(z,y)$ called and how is it denoted? Obviously in this example $g(z, y) = f(z, -y)$ but this only works for addition.

3482417,Show that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}}\sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})$ converges uniformly on $\mathbb{R}$,"I am trying to show the followng: Show that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}}\sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})$ converges uniformly on $\mathbb{R}$ . I have shown it for a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ however, do not know how to extend it to the reals. Below is my proof for convergence on a compact subset. I break up the sum into two parts and attack each individually $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}}\sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})$ = $\underbrace{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}}\sin(1)}_{(1)}$ + $\underbrace{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}}[\sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})-\sin(1)]}_{(2)}$ . $\textbf{Equation (1)}$ $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}}\sin(1)$ converges because $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}}$ converges by the alternating series test. $\textbf{Equation (2)}$ we will first bound $\sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})-\sin(1)$ as follows: \begin{align*}
|\sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})-\sin(1)| &= \Big|\int_{1}^{1+\frac{x}{n}} \cos(t)dt\Big| \\
                                &\leq \Big|\int_{1}^{1+\frac{x}{n}} |\cos(t)| dt\Big| \\
                                &\leq \Big|\int_{1}^{1+\frac{x}{n}} dt\Big| \\
                                &\leq \Big|1+\frac{x}{n} - 1 \Big| \\
                                &= \frac{|x|}{n} \\
\end{align*} Therefore, on any compact interval $ x \in [-M, M]$ \begin{align*}
|\sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})-\sin(1)| \leq \frac{M}{n}
\end{align*} It follows that \begin{align*}
\Big|\frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}} \Big( \sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})-\sin(1)\Big)\Big| &= \Big|\frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}}\Big|\Big|\sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})-\sin(1)\Big| \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\Big|\sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})-\sin(1)\Big| \\
&\leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\frac{M}{n} \\
&= \frac{M}{n^{\frac{3}{2}}}
\end{align*} Hence, \begin{align*}
\sum_{n}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{\frac{3}{2}}} < \infty &\implies \sum_{n}^{\infty}\frac{M}{n^{\frac{3}{2}}} < \infty \\
&\implies \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\Big|\frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}} \Big[ \sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})-\sin(1)\Big]\Big| < \infty \\
&\implies \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}} \Big[ \sin(1 + \frac{x}{n})-\sin(1)\Big] < \infty
\end{align*} Hence, we have that both $(1)$ and $(2)$ converge on a compact interval $[-M,M]$ which implies our original equation of interest does also.

The former is true if the representation of elements of $\mathbb R$ described in (1) is correct, and the latter is true if not.

3482489,Why does the p-adic norm use base p?,"To recapitulate some definitions, A norm on a field $K$ is a function $|\cdot|: K \rightarrow \mathbb R$ such that: $|x|_p = 0 \iff x = 0$ $|xy| = |x||y|$ $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$ To define the $p$ -adic norm on $\mathbb Q$ , we first create a valuation function $v_p: \mathbb Z \rightarrow \mathbb R$ , such that $v_p(n)$ is the unique number such that ${n = p^{v_p(n)} m,~p \nmid m}$ . That is, $v_p(n)$ is the highest power of $p$ occuring in the prime factorization of $n$ . I set $v_p(0) = \infty$ , since $0$ can be divided by $p$ infinitely many times. Next, we extend the valuation to the rationals by setting $v_p : \mathbb Q^\times \rightarrow \mathbb R$ , $v_p(a/b) \equiv v_p(a) - v_p(b)$ . We now note that the valuation is additive while the norm is multiplicative. Also, as the power $i$ in $p^i$ grows larger, so too does $v_p(p^i)$ . However, we want large powers of $p$ to become smaller (so that infinite series in $p^i$ converge). We solve both of these by creating the p-adic norm as: $|n|_p \equiv p^{-v_p(n)}$ However, the choice of base $p$ is arbitrary here. As far as I can tell, we could have just as well chose $|n|_p \equiv e^{-v_p(n)}$ , and all the properties of a norm would have worked out. So, why do we pick base $p$ ? Is there something particular nice that happens? Why can't we pick any base $c > 1$ for the norm?","['number-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

But I am interested in the map $n\mapsto \psi^{(1)}(n)$ .

3482945,Integrability of the derivative of an increasing function- MIT primes 2020 A2,"Problem A2 from the MIT PRIMES Problem Set 2020 goes as following (discussion is already open): Let $f: [0,1]\to \mathbb{R}$ be a strictly increasing function which is differentiable in $(0,1)$ . Suppose that $f(0)=0$ and for every $x\in(0,1)$ we have $$\frac{f'(x)}{x}\ge f(x)^2+1.$$ How small can $f(1)$ be? I thought the solution idea was pretty straightforward; it follows pretty quickly from integrating the rearranged inequality $\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)^2+1}\ge x$ . However, it is somewhat difficult to prove the left side is integrable. We can show that $\arctan(f(x))$ is increasing, and the derivative of an increasing function satisfies using the Lebesgue integral $\int_a^bf'(x)dx\le f(b)-f(a)$ . I was wondering if it is necessarily true that the left hand side is Riemann integrable, and if not, what is a counterexample? If it were Riemann integrable, we could have $\int_a^bf'(x)dx= f(b)-f(a)$ , which is slightly stronger.","['integration', 'calculus', 'riemann-integration', 'real-analysis']"

3483286,The gradient of a function has constant Euclidean length $1$,"Consider a function $f : \mathbb R^{2} \to \mathbb R$ that is defined on every point and is differentiable. Then it has a gradient $\nabla f$ . Now, suppose that $|\nabla f(x,y)| = 1$ for all $x,y \in \mathbb R^{2}$ . Then must the function be a linear function (and hence $\nabla f$ is constant)? That was the question. So I was thinking that the answer should be no, but coming up with an example is hard. We can draw the field lines for the gradient, and it should be orthogonal to the level curves. And since the gradient is of length 1, it seem intuitive that for any level curves $f(x,y)=c$ and $f(x,y)=d$ if you draw any field lines between them the length along the field line connecting these curve should be $|d-c|$ . So an easy idea here is to take concentric circle to be level curve, but this one can't be made into a function differentiable at the center of these circles. Or perhaps I should start with field lines instead? Start with a family of field lines, cut a single level curve through it, declare that to be $0$ , then going along each field lines and find the value of the function depending on the length. I could go with a family of parabola because that's the only thing that perhaps the length can be computed. But it's going to be a mess, so I don't know if I should keep going with this. So is there a simpler way? Or am I heading in a completely wrong direction here? EDIT: found an older question that answered this: $|\nabla f (x)| =1$ implies $f$ linear? .

This will have an integer value $\pm 2^m$ for some $m$ , and the value of $m$ is the position of the bit which has changed, and the sign determines whether that bit has been added or subtracted.

3483382,A conjecture regarding products of $u(x)=x+\frac1x$,"Recently, in a pre-calculus textbook I saw lying around my high school, I saw a problem having something to do with the neat identity $$\left(a+\frac1a\right)\left(b+\frac1b\right)\left(ab+\frac1{ab}\right)=2+a^2+\frac1{a^2}+b^2+\frac1{b^2}+a^2b^2+\frac1{a^2b^2}.$$ The details of the problem aren't too important, but it got me thinking that there must be a generalization. To make more apparent the cool nature of this identity I rephrase it in terms of the function $u(x)=x+\frac1{x}$ : $$u(a)u(b)u(ab)-u(1)=u(a^2)+u(b^2)+u(a^2b^2).$$ Indeed, there is an analog to this formula: $$\begin{align}
u(a)u(b)u(c)u(abc)-u(1) &= u(a^2)+u(b^2)+u(c^2)\\
&+u(a^2b^2)+u(a^2c^2)+u(b^2c^2)\\
&+u(a^2b^2c^2).
\end{align}$$ And yet another analog: $$u^2(a)-u(1)=u(a^2).$$ This pattern was immediately recognizable to me, and I formed a conjecture. Fix any $n\in \Bbb N$ . Conjecture: For $a_k\ne 0$ , $k=1,2,...,n$ , we have $$\Pi_n:=u\left(\small{\prod_{k=1}^{n}}a_k\right)\prod_{k=1}^{n}u(a_k)=u(1)+\sum_{k=1}^{n}\sum_{\sigma\subset S_n\\ |\sigma|=k}u\left(\small{\prod_{j\in\sigma}}a_j^2\right),\tag{1}$$ where $S_n=\{1,2,...,n\}$ . As you can see, $(1)$ holds for $n=1,2,3$ . The process is very horrible, but I was able to verify the $n=4$ case as well. I have not yet verified any $n\ge5$ , as the algebra gets really messy really quickly. My hope is to bypass this messy process by attacking the general case directly. I plan to do this by using the fact that, given a finite set $A$ of size $n$ , we have $$\prod_{p\in A}(x+p)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}x^k\sum_{\sigma\subset A\\ |\sigma|=n-k}\prod_{p\in\sigma}p,$$ so that $$\Pi_n=u(P)\prod_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1+a_k^2}{a_k}=\frac{P^2+1}{P^2}\prod_{k=1}^{n}(1+a_k^2) \qquad [\text{where }P=\prod_{k=1}^{n}a_k]$$ is the same as $$\Pi_n=\frac{P^2+1}{P^2}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\sum_{\sigma\subset S_n\\ |\sigma|=k}\prod_{j\in\sigma}a_j^2.$$ This looks close enough to give me hope for the future, but not close enough to see all the way to the end of the tunnel.

3483638,Proof of Isomorphism between Tangent Space and the Vector Space of all Derivations,"In his book An Introduction to Manifolds (Second Edition) on page no. 13, Loring Tu proves the following theorem. Theorem 2.2 The linear map $\phi: T_P(\mathbb{R}^n) \rightarrow \mathscr{D}_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ defined by $v \mapsto D_v = \sum_{i} v^i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces. Here $\mathscr{D}_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the set of all derivations at $p$ which is, of course, a vector space. In the proof of surjectivity, he uses Taylor's theorem with remainder to expand a smooth function $f: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined on a star-convex neighborhood $V$ of the point $p$ : $$
f(x) = f(p) + \sum_{i} (x^i - p^i) g_i(x), \quad g_i(p) = \frac{\partial f}{ \partial x^i}(p).
$$ Then he applies $D$ on both sides and uses $D(f(p)) = 0$ and $D(p^i) = 0$ to arrive at the following equaiton: $$ Df(x) = \sum (Dx^i) g_i(p) + \sum (p^i - p^i) Dg_i(x) = \sum (Dx^i) \frac{\partial f}{ \partial x^i}(p),
$$ where $D$ is a derivation at point $p$ . My Confusion I can't arrive at this equation. My Attempts \begin{eqnarray}
f(x) &=& f(p) + \sum_{i} (x^i - p^i) \, g_i(x) \\
\Rightarrow Df(x) &=& D(f(p)) + D\left(\sum_{i} (x^i - p^i) \, g_i(x)\right) \\
\Rightarrow Df(x) &=& \sum_{i} (x^i - p^i)D\left(g_i(x)\right) + \sum_{i} D\left((x^i - p^i)\right) g_i(x) \\
\Rightarrow \left[Df(x)\right]_p &=& \sum_{i} \left[(x^i - p^i)\right]_p \,\,\left[D\left(g_i(x)\right)\right]_p + \sum_{i} \left[D\left((x^i - p^i)\right)\right]_p \,\,\left[g_i(x)\right]_p \\
\Rightarrow Df(p) &=& 0 + \sum_{i} \left[D(x^i)\right]_p \,\,\left[g_i(x)\right]_p \\
\Rightarrow Df(p) &=& \sum_{i} D(p^i) g_i(p) \\
\Rightarrow Df(p) &=& \sum_{i} D(p^i) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(p).
\end{eqnarray} A change of variables $p \longleftrightarrow x$ yields, $$Df(x) = \sum_{i} D(x^i) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\color{red} x)$$ whereas Tu writes, $$Df(x) = \sum_{i} D(x^i) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(\color{red}p).$$ I don't see where I have made the mistake.","['manifolds', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

(2) show that $M_0$ is diffeomorphic to the 2-torus. (3) find all points at which $f$ is a submersion. I have some problem with this exercise because I want to use the regular value theorem but proving that $f$ is a submersion at all points of $f^{-1}(0)$ , with charts of $\mathbb{S}^3$ , needs way too many calculations.

Clearly $\widetilde{f}$ is a submersion at all points $p\neq 0$ , so also at every $p\in \mathbb{S}^3$ .

3483723,"Closed - form expression for the finite sum $\sum _{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k \sec \left(\frac{\pi\, k}{n}+\frac{\pi }{2 \ n}\right)$","Is there a closed - 
 form expression for the finite sum on the secant function : $$\sum _{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k \sec \left(\frac{\pi \, k}{n}+\frac{\pi }{2\,n}\right)$$ as a function of n? Motivation: The sum is part of a more elaborated solution of Eric Naslund of the integral: $$\int_0^{\infty } \text{sech}(z)\,\text{sech}(n\,z) \, dz = \frac{\pi}{2\,
n} \sum _{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k \sec \left(\frac{\pi\, k}{n}+\frac{\pi }{2\,n}\right)+\frac{1}{2} \pi  \sec \left(\frac{\pi\, n}{2}\right)$$ which holds for any even number n. Attempt at a solution: There are some interesting papers, WEN CHANG CHU , Djurdje Cvijovic, H.M. Srivastava and HONGWEI CHEN , considering the summation of finite secant sums. Investigations of the first bibliographical reference lead to the closed form expression for the similar finite sum: $$\sum _{k=0}^n (-1)^k \sec \left(2 \left(\frac{\pi\,k}{n}+y\right)\right)=\frac{2\,n \,\sin \left(\frac{\pi\,n}{4}\right) \,\cos \left(\frac{n\,y}{2}\right)}{\cos
(n\,y)-\cos \left(\frac{\pi\,n}{2}\right)}+\sec (y)$$ with $y = \frac{1}{2\,n}$ , which can be further investigated by: $$\sec (2\,z) = \frac{\sec ^2(z)}{2-\sec ^2(z)}$$ and $$\sec (\frac{z}{2})=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{\cos (z)+1}} (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{\pi +\Re(z)}{2 \pi }\right\rfloor } \left(1-\left((-1)^{\left\lfloor -\frac{\pi +\Re(z)}{2 \pi }\right\rfloor
+\left\lfloor \frac{\pi +\Re(z)}{2 \pi }\right\rfloor }+1\right) \theta (-\Im(z))\right)
$$ where $\Theta$ is the ""unitstep"" - function. In case of the last bibliographical reference, the main difference to the sum above is, that [HONGWEI CHEN], deals only with higher powers of a similar sum - but without that ""factor 2"" - e.g. $$S_{2 n}(\text{q})\text{:=}\sum _{p = 0\,\text{;}\,p\neq \frac{q}{2}  (\text{q is even})}^{q-1} \sec ^{2\, n}\left(\frac{\pi\,  p}{q}\right)$$ Another attempt at a solution is to write the sum as a ""q-series"" Dieckmann . EDIT A new approach is to split the sum e.g. 
for $n=4,8,12,...$ [Claude Leibovici] $$\sum _{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k \sec \left(\frac{\pi  (2\,k+1)}{2\,n}\right)=2 \sum _{l=0}^{\frac{n}{4}-1} (-1)^l \sec \left(\frac{\pi \, (2\,l+1)}{2\,n}\right)-2
\sum _{l=0}^{\frac{n}{4}-1} (-1)^l \csc \left(\frac{\pi\,  (2\,l+1)}{2\,n}\right)$$ The summary of the preliminary work give some evidence that a closed - 
 form expression exists: The finite sum can be simplified to: $$S_{n}=\sum _{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k \sec \left(\frac{\pi\,k}{n}+\frac{\pi }{2\,n}\right)=2 \,\sum _{k=0}^{\frac{n}{2}-1} \sec \left(\frac{2\,\pi\,k}{n}+\frac{\pi}{2\,n}\right)$$ For the proof one has to split the sum in even and odd ""k's"". From expressions of the first bibliographical reference and the help of Dieckmann the following identity can be proven: $$W_{n}=\sum _{k=0}^n \frac{1}{\cos \left(\frac{2\, \pi\,  k}{n}\right)+z}=\frac{ n \,\cot \left(\frac{n}{4}\, \left(2\, \sin^{-1}(z)+\pi \right)\right)}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}+\frac{1}{z+1}$$ From the proof of the main result of [HONGWEI CHEN] one derive the further identity: $$V_{n}=\sum _{k=0}^n \frac{1}{\cos \left(\frac{\pi \, k}{n}\right)+z}=\frac{z}{z^2-1}-\frac{n \cot \left(n \cos ^{-1}(z)\right)}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}$$ Now we split the finite sum $W_{n}$ for even numbers n: $$W_{n}=\sum _{k=0}^{\frac{n}{2}} \frac{1}{\cos \left(\frac{2 \,\pi \, k}{n}\right)+z}+\sum _{k=\frac{n}{2}+1}^n \frac{1}{\cos \left(\frac{2\,\pi \,k}{n}\right)+z}$$ We express the first sum of $W_{n}$ by $V_{n}$ and solve for the last sum. This leads to: $$S_{z,w,n}=2 \sum _{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{z-\cos \left(\frac{\pi \, k}{n}+\frac{\pi}{w\,n}\right)}$$ For $w=1$ we have: $$S_{z,1,n}=\frac{2\, n \,\left(\cot \left(n \cos ^{-1}(z)\right)+2\, \cot \left(\frac{1}{2} \,n \,\left(2 \,\sin ^{-1}(z)+\pi \right)\right)\right)}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}+\frac{2}{1-z^2}$$ The limit $\lim_{z\to 0}$ and $w=4$ gives the solution. With other words we need a general expression, dependent of $w$ , with $S_{z,1,n}$ for $w=1$ . EDIT II Mathematica can find a solution expressed in closed form using the q-polygamma function: $$S_{\frac{n}{2}}=\frac{2\,n}{\pi } \left(\psi _{e^{-\frac{i\,\pi}{n}}}\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{n}{2}\right)-2\, \psi _{e^{-\frac{i\,\pi }{n}}}\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{n}{2}\right)+\psi_{e^{-\frac{i\,\pi }{n}}}\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3\,n}{2}\right)\right)$$ where $\psi _q(z)$ is the q-polygamma function. With the function ""FunctionExpand"" Mathematica expands the q-polygamma function with the complex argument and one can verify the radicals of [Vepir].
Numerically the values can be optained by the well-known identity for the q-polygamma function: $$\psi _q(x+1)=\psi _q(x)-\frac{q^x \log (q)}{1-q^x}$$ Using the identity n-times recursively, in the expression $S_{\frac{n}{2}}$ , $\psi _q(x)$ for $x=\frac{1}{4}$ vanishes!

This doesn't seem too helpful, since $|\log(|z|)| \rightarrow \infty$ as $|z| \rightarrow \infty$ and $|z| \rightarrow 0$ . ii) Expanding $f$ in a power series at $0$ gives $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ , so we may use the fact that $$|a_n| \leq \frac{1}{2 \pi r^n} \int_0^{2\pi} |f(re^{i \theta})| d \theta.$$ Using the bound $|f(z)| \leq |\log (|z|) |$ could show that $a_n =0$ for any $n $ , proving that $f(z) \equiv 0$ .

line. The other points are in general everywhere else, so there are no $3$ points on same one straight line. How many different triangles can
you create from these n points? What I think is: since no three points in the plane are collinear, a triangle can be formed by selecting any three of the $n$ points. The three points can be selected in $^nC_3$ ways, similarly, the number of triangles formed by $8$ collinear points when no three points are collinear in the plane is $^8C_3$ . However, the triangles formed by these points are not allowed, so the total number of triangles formed would be ${^nC_3}- {^8C_3}$ Is that correct?","['discrete-mathematics', 'abstract-algebra', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"
3483917,Understanding a Sobolev Embedding Theorem,"In my adv. Analysis course, we have studied the following Sobolev Embedding Theorem: Let $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $s>m+d/2$ . Then $$H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)\hookrightarrow C_0^m(\mathbb{R}^d)$$ That is: $H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ embeds into $C_0^m(\mathbb{R}^d)$ The proof we've studied basically starts by noticing that the Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is dense in $H^s$ , and then it goes on proving that the inclusion map $$i:H^s\overset{\mathrm{dense}}{\supseteq}\mathcal{S} \longrightarrow C_0^m$$ is continuous. 
So by existence (and uniqueness) of an extended (injective) linear bounded operator, we have in fact an embedding from the Sobolev Space $H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ into $C_0^m(\mathbb{R}^d)$ . But I'm asking myself the nature of such extended embedding, more precisely: Does it mean that, under the hypotheses of the theorem, the Sobolev space $H^s$ is a ""subset"" of $C_0^m$ ? In the sense that every function in $H^s$ has a representative (of the a.e. equivalence class) in $C_0^m$ ? In other words, does the extension of the inclusion behaves as an inclusion?

They attribute the classification of the finite subgroups of $\textrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ to Felix Klein, but they do not provide a reference. After extensive research, I have been unable to find a resource that treats the matter. This is of course what the progress made on the proof of Artin's conjecture in the case of two-dimensional representations hinges upon. If anyone could provide a reference, or briefly explain why the above list is an exhaustive classification of the finite subgroups of $\textrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ , I would be most grateful. $\textbf{Addendum}:$ I have still not solved the above and therefore add a bounty. I add that on p. 25 of $\textit{Base Change for}\ \textrm{GL}(2)$ by R.P. Langlands, he mentions in passing that $\textrm{PGL}(2,\mathbb{C}) \cong \textrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{C})$ , which is significant. But it still remains to show that the finite subgroups of $\textrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{C})$ fall into one of the five classes listed above, which is not obvious to me. The list is of course reminiscent of the five known platonic solids: The tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron, and the icosahedron.

Show that $S$ is not differentiable at any point in $(0,\infty)$ . My Attempt I am working through a textbook to practice real analysis in preparation for an upcoming analysis sequence. I have been stuck on this problem for hours and have no one to ask about it. My first idea was to switch the limits: $$ \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{S(x+h)-S(x)}{h}=\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{S_m(x+h)-S_m(x)}{h}$$ . Then I realized that $f_1$ isn't differentiable at multiples of $\frac12$ , $f_2$ isn't differentiable at multiples of $\frac14$ , and in general $f_n$ isn't differentiable at multiples of $\frac{1}{2^n}$ . Intuitively, as m approaches $\infty$ then $x$ gets closer and closer to some multiple of $\frac{1}{2^n}$ for some $n$ . Hence, $f_m(x)$ approximately isn't differentiable at some m (I mean this in the vaguest of terms). If $f_m(x)$ isn't differentiable, then $S_m(x)$ isn't differentiable. Hence, $S(x)$ isn't differentiable. However, this is where I stuck. $\textbf{Does anyone know what to do next?

(2)Description of my textbook. (Added on 2020/01/01 JST) My text book (Written in Japanese) has following description. 
The equation are excerpt from the textbook and I add the equation number
to indicate to which formula in this thread corresponds. (See Fig. 1. Equation numbers in following Fig 1 represents corresponding equation number in this thread.) Fig.1 Comparing my textbook with this thread, 
it seem that I correctly quote equations (1-1) through (1-4) and my calculation of ${H}_{2}$ (See 2-5) might be correct. 
In my textbook, neither the calculation process nor the answer of other H or m is written, so I do not know about other H and m.","['physics', 'algebra-precalculus', 'electromagnetism', 'linear-algebra']"
3484341,A certain bipartite graph has a matching,"Let $G=(L,R,E)$ be a bipartite connected graph. I wish to prove that $G$ has a matching for all vertices of the left side $L$ , assuming I know that for every edge $\left(l_i , r_j \right)$ that deg $\left( l_i \right) \geq$ deg $\left( r_j \right)$ . Intuitively, I want to show how I can construct (possibly, by induction) a matching for all vertices of the side $L$ . For a single vertex, it is obvious. But I'm having a bit trouble for the induction step, which got me thinking - maybe there is a simpler way than by induction?

\end{align*} I tried dividing both sides of the rational by trig functions like $\tan u$ or $\cos u/6$ , new definitions (e.g., trig Pythagorean identity for 1), and I tried using a calculator and I would only get decimal values when I'm trying to get the answer $\cfrac{\sqrt3}{3}$","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions', 'trigonometry']"
3484417,"Every subset of a countable set is countable, proven by contradiction","Kolmogorov & Fomin show that every subset of a countable set is countable by taking a set $A$ with elements $a_{1}, a_{2}, ...$ , and a subset of $A$ called $B$ with elements $a_{n_1}, a_{n_2}, ...$ , then arguing that if the $n_i$ have a largest element B is a finite set, otherwise B is countable with the correspondence $i \iff a_{n_i}$ . This is pretty much the only way I've seen this theorem proved anywhere, and while I appreciate how concise this approach is, for me it's much more intuitive to think of this in terms of the contradiction: Theorem: Every subset of a countable set is countable. Proof. First, we prove a lemma: Lemma : Let $f:A\rightarrow B$ be a bijection, $C \subseteq A$ , and $f\vert_{C}:C\rightarrow B$ the restriction of $f$ to $C$ . Then $f\vert_{C}$ is a bijection. Proof: Since $f$ is a bijection, $b = f(c)$ is uniquely defined for each $c \in C$ , $b \in B$ . Hence $f\vert_{C}$ , is a bijection, and the lemma is proved. Now let $A$ be a countable set, with $B$ a subset of $A$ . Let's suppose that $B$ is not countable. In other words we suppose that there does not exist a bijection between $B$ and some subset of the natural numbers. Since A is countable, there is a bijection $\phi:A\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ . Because $\phi$ is a bijection, it is defined for each element of $A$ including those in $B$ , hence the restriction $\phi\vert_{B}:B\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ must exist. Note that $\phi\vert_{B}$ is also bijective by our lemma. But this is impossible, since by hypothesis $B$ is not countable, so no such bijection can exist. Then we have reached a contradiction, and must assume otherwise -- namely, $B$ must be countable. Since $B$ was arbitrarily chosen, we can assume this holds in general for all subsets of countable sets. $\square$ My questions are the following: Is this proof sound? Given the length of my proof, I can see the appeal of the K&F style proof over this (assuming mine is sound). Are there places where mine could be made more concise? For example, I considered that the lemma might not be necessary since it (seems to) follow directly from the definition","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-writing', 'solution-verification']"
