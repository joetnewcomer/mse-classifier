837634,calculate $\int_{0}^{\pi} \int_{0}^{x}\log(\sin(x-y))dydx$,"I was asked to find the integral $\iint_A \log(\sin(x-y))dxdy$ where $A$ is the triangle $y=0, x=\pi, y=x$ in the first quadrant. I was given a hint: evaluate $\int_{0}^{\pi}\log(\sin(t))dt$ using symmetry. What I did: I inferred from the hint that the variable change $t=x-y$ is the way to go, so $t=x-y$, 
and since we integrate by $y$ first, then $x$ is a ""constant"" and $dt=-dy$, and since $y$ transitions from $0$ to $x$, then $t$ transitions from $x$ to $0$, so we can rewrite the integral: $$\int_{0}^{\pi} \int_{0}^{x}\log(\sin(x-y))dydx=\int_{0}^{\pi}\int_{x}^{0}-\log(\sin( t))dtdx=\int_{0}^{\pi}\int_{0}^{x}\log(\sin( t))dtdx$$ And here I am stuck. Firstly, I don't know how $\int_{0}^{\pi}\log(\sin(t))dt$ is related to the question, since in the question the limits are $0$ and $x$. not $0$ and $\pi$.

Show that the arc length of the graph is smaller than 3. I have a rather geometric proof. For any $P$ be any (finite) partition of $[0,1]$ , then $$\Lambda(P,(x,f(x)))$$ is nothing but the sum of length of finitely many polygon arcs. Using mean value theorem we can show that these arcs are convex. By certain argument we can show that sum of the lengths of these polygon arcs are always smaller than sum of the boundary three sides, which is 3. Since this is true for any $P$ and $$\Gamma((x,f(x)) = \sup_P\Gamma(P,(x,f(x)))\le 3.$$ We are done.

837702,Artin-Schreier Question from Corps Locaux,"I have a question from Serre's book ""Corps Locaux"", namely question 5a in section 2 of chapter IV. It is as follows: ""Let $e_K$ be the absolute ramification index of K, and let n be a positive integer prime to p and (strictly) less than $pe_K/(p-1)$; let y be an element of valuation -n. Show that the Artin-Schreier equation $x^p - x =y$ is irreducible over K, and defines an extension L/K which is cyclic of degree p. (Show that if x is a root of this equation, then the other roots have the form $x + z_i$ $(0 \leq i < p$, with $z_i \in A_K$, and $z_i \equiv i \mod{\mathbb{p_L}}$."" Here $K$ is characteristic 0, its residue field has positive characteristic p, and $K$ is a complete local field. I'm struggling with the last part, namely showing the roots have the given form. Right now, as $(n,p)=1$, if $x$ is any root then $val(x^p) = -n$, which forces any root to not be within $K$. If I can show that in the extension of $K$ generated by $x$ I can write all other roots in the desired form, this will mean $K(x)$ is the splitting field and the Galois group will act transitively on the roots, whence the result. Could I be pointed in the right direction? Thanks, Garnet","['local-field', 'number-theory']"

837736,Proof behind $S^n\cong SO(n+1)/SO(n)$,"I have been trying to understand the fact that $S^n \cong SO(n+1)/SO(n)$. I believe I have the intuition correct at this point; consider the case when $n=2$ as we have $S^2 \cong SO(3)/SO(2)$.: We are trying to find the correspondence between rotations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and points on $S^2$. At first I incorrectly thought that these spaces were isomorphic, however one then realizes that there are more rotations than points on a sphere, in the following sense: Consider the point $p$ at the ""north pole"" of the sphere $S^2$. We can correspond $p$ with any point on the sphere by rotating the sphere, that is, by applying elements on $SO(3)$ so that $p$ ends up at any place upon it. However, we can first apply any rotation around the $z$-axis (through $p$). So, by ""modding out"" these rotations, which are exactly the elements of $SO(2)$, we have our isomorphism.

837748,What's wrong $\sin(2\theta) = \cos\theta$,"When solving $\sin(2\theta) = \cos\theta$ for $\theta$ for all values in the range $[0,2\pi]$ I only get half of the solutions when I reduce $\sin(2\theta) = \cos\theta$ to $\sin\theta = \frac{1}{2}$. So before reducing the equation the solutions are $\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{6}, \frac{3\pi}{2}$ and after reducing the equation the solutions are only $\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{5\pi}{6}$ I can see how it reduces the solution set, but I want to know 'why' it happens. How can you know exactly when you're reducing the solution set of an equation when you're reducing the equation itself to a simpler form, especially when it's a big complicated equation when you can't easily see that you're reducing the solution set as in this case?

837768,"Bayes, two tests in a row","I came up with a standard Bayesian example as to point out my confusion. There is an epidemic. A person has a probability $\frac{1}{100}$ to have the disease. The authorities decide to test the population, but the test is not completely reliable: the test generally gives $\frac{1}{110}$ people a positive result but given that you have the disease the probability of getting a positive result is $\frac{80}{100}$. I am interested in what happens after a person takes another test, specifically how much more information we would gain. Probability after one test Let $D$ denote the event of having the disease, let $T$ denote event of a positive outcome of a test. If we are interested in finding $P(D|T)$ then we can just go and apply Bayes rule: $$ P(D|T) = \frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.01}{0.009} = 0.88 $$ This feels about right. Probability after two tests This is where I think I misunderstand Bayes rule somewhat. Let $TT$ denote the outcome of two positive tests. We are now interested in calculating; $$ P(D|TT) = \frac{P(TT|D)P(D)}{P(TT)} $$ The prior $P(D)$ is still $\frac{1}{100}$. $P(TT|D)$ would now be $0.8 \times 0.8$ because the two test can be assumed to be independent. But I seem to not know how to deal with $P(TT)$ ... it cannot be $\frac{1}{110} \times \frac{1}{110}$ because then; $$ \frac{P(TT|D)P(D)}{P(TT)} = \frac{0.64 \times 0.01}{0.009^2} > 1 $$ What is the right approach to the two-test Bayesian case?","['bayesian', 'probability']"

837839,"simple way to show $|| \partial_x \int_{B(x,\epsilon)} \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3} f(y) dy||_{\infty} = O(||f||_{\infty})$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$","We are set in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Let $f: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a $C^1_0$ function, i.e. continuously differentiable with compact support. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be small. I need to show that the derivative 
$$ || \partial_x [\int_{B(x,\epsilon)} \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3}  f(y)dy] ||_{\infty}$$ 
of this integral function exists and can be bounded from above by a constant times $||f||_{\infty}$ for $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$. We can take any $\infty$ norm we want for the derivative, we're differentiating a function $\mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ so the derivative is a matrix, but we can take for example supremum over its entries, so 
$$ \max_{i \in \{1,2,3\}} | \partial_{x_i} [\int_{B(x,\epsilon)} \frac{x_1 - y_1}{|x-y|^3}  f(y)dy] |$$
for example (or something else if it's easier, but I guess it shouldn't differ much). I want to show that this quantity can be bounded from above by $C ||f||_{\infty}$ with $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$. I can't just push the derivative in and say that $\partial_x \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3} \approx |x-y|^{-3}$ because that won't let me conclude - $|x-y|^{-3}$ is not integrable around $0$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. I was thinking about pushing the derivative inside and computing explicitly using spherical coordiantes but there are two issues: first it seems really cumbersome and I'd rather avoid it and use simpler arguments if possible and second - I'd still have to argue why I can push the derivative inside. Any suggestions are welcome. edit: when I think about it I imagine an actual difference quotient when I consider two sphere centered at $x$ and $x +h$ and I guess that I could take care of the overlapping part by 'pairing up' the points with factors $f(y)$ and $f(y+h)$, taking supremum of $\nabla f$ and integrating - that would go to $0$ with $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ and I expect that the parts that I wouldn't get to pair up with anything will have measure suffiently small (so that the integrals are comparable with $|h|$) so that I can use the  $||f||_{\infty}$ bound there but I'm having a hard time writing it down Edit : my more precise although still incomplete try. I show how to bound the derivative assuming it exists: ok, after all it seems to be not that difficult, which gets me a bit worried so it would be great if someone could point out a mistake I might've made. I guess the only tricky part is showing that the function is indeed differentiable - if we knew that it would suffice to show that 
$$ \frac{1}{|h|} | \int_{B(x,\epsilon)} \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3} f(y) dy - \int_{B(x + h,\epsilon)} \frac{x+h-y}{|x+h-y|^3} f(y) dy| \leq C \epsilon$$
for some constant $C$. a change of variables $y = y-h$ in the second integral gives
$$ \frac{1}{|h|} | \int_{B(x,\epsilon)} \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3} f(y) dy - \int_{B(x,\epsilon)} \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3} f(y+h) dy|$$
i.e.
$$  | \int_{B(x,\epsilon)} \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3} \frac{f(y) - f(y+h)}{|h|} dy | \leq \int_{B(x,\epsilon)} \frac{1}{|x-y|^2} ||\nabla f||_{\infty} dy \leq C ||\nabla f||_{\infty} \epsilon$$ 
because $\int_{B(x,\epsilon)} \frac{1}{|x-y|^2} = C \epsilon$, hence the whole thing goes to $0$ with $\epsilon$. Nevertheless we still need to know that it is differentiable however, the paper I'm reading clearly states that we bound it by a constant times $||f||_{\infty}$ which confuses me since if I knew it was differentiable I could say it tends to $0$ with $\epsilon$ and if I don't know whether it's differentiable then I can't really talk about bounding the derivative edit2 : ok, I see where I went wrong - I got the wrong area of integration after my change of variables. I still believe though that if I knew the derivative exists I could replace the second (wrong) integral 
$$
\int_{B(x,\epsilon)} \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3} f(y+h) dy| $$
with $$ \int_{B(x,\epsilon - 2|h|)} \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3} f(y+h) dy|$$ plus some remainder which would then lead to a bound involving $||f||_{\infty}$ but we need differentiability to do that anyway.","['derivatives', 'integration', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

837853,Serre's Modularity Conjecture -- Weight,"I was reading Serre's paper ""Sur les Représentations Modulaires de Degré $2$ de Gal($\bar{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}$)"" where he states his modularity conjecture (which is now a theorem). Following his notation, let $G_p$ be the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, $I$ the (absolute) inertia group and $I_p$ the wild inertia group. In order to define the weight $k$ attached to a Galois representation it is only needed to look locally at $p$, so consider a continuous representation 
\begin{equation*}
\rho_p:G_p\longrightarrow \mathbf{GL}_2(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p)
\end{equation*} Now the paper splits into several cases. The one I am looking at is in page $186$ (of the Duke Mathematical Journal where it appeared) and corresponds to the case where $I_p$ does not act trivially and the restriction of the representation to $I$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
\rho_p|I=\begin{pmatrix}\chi^{\alpha+1} & *\\ 0 & \chi^{\alpha}\end{pmatrix}

for some $\alpha\in\{0,\ldots,p-2\}$, where $\chi$ is the cyclotomic character. It is clear that $\rho_p(I)$ is the Galois group of some totally ramified extension $K$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p^{nr}$ and that $\rho_p(I_p)$ is the Galois group of $K/K^{tr}$, where $K^{tr}$ is the maximal tamely ramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p^{nr}$ contained in $K$. My question is the following: a few lines down he asserts that by Kummer theory we can deduce that $K=K^{tr}(x_1^{1/p},\ldots,x_m^{1/p})$, with $x_i\in\mathbb{Q}_p^{nr}$. I can see, by Kummer theory, that $K$ is of this form for $x_i\in K^{tr}$. Why is it true that we can place these $x_i$ in $\mathbb{Q}_p^{nr}$?

837986,Solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (Evans),"I can comprehend some but not all of the proofs. I do not understand how the limit definition of a derivative is derived in this context, and those are highlighted in $\color{#009900}{\text{green}}$. This is from PDE Evans, 2nd edition, pages 127-128. Theorem 5 (Solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation). Suppose $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $t > 0$, and $u$ defined by the Hopf-Lax formula $$u(x,t)=\min_{y\in\mathbb{R}^n} \left\{tL\left(\frac{x-y}{t} \right) + g(y) \right\}$$ is differentiable at a point $(x,t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times (0,\infty)$. Then $$u_t(x,t)+H(Du(x,t))=0.$$ Proof. 1.) Fix $v \in \mathbb{R}^n, h > 0$. Owing to Lemma 1, 
  \begin{align}
u(x+hv,t+h)&=\min_{y \in \mathbb{R}^n} \left\{ hL\left(\frac{x+hv-y} 
{h}\right)+u(y,t)\right\} \\
&\le hL(v)+u(x,t).
\end{align}
  Hence, $$\frac{u(x+hv,t+h)-u(x,t)}{h} \le L(v).$$
  Let $h \rightarrow 0^+$, to compute $$\underbrace{v \cdot Du(x,t)+u_t(x,t)}_{\color{#009900}{\text{How is this expression obtained?}}} \le L(v).$$
  This inequality is valid for all $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and so $$u_t(x,t)+H(Du(x,t))=u_t(x,t)+\max_{v \in \mathbb{R}^n} \{v \cdot Du(x,t)-L(v) \} \le 0. \tag{31}$$
  The first equality holds since $H = L^*:=\max_{v \in \mathbb{R}^n} \{v \cdot Du(x,t)-L(v) \}$, by convex duality of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian (page 121 of the book). 2.) Now chose $z$ such that $u(x,t)=tL(\frac{x-z}{t})+g(z)$. Fix $h > 0$ and set $s=t-h,y=\frac st x+(1- \frac st)z$. Then $\frac{x-z}{t}=\frac{y-z}{s}$, and thus
  \begin{align}
u(x,t)-u(y,s) &\ge tL\left(\frac{y-z}{s}  \right) + g(z) - \left[sL\left(\frac{y-z}{s} \right)+g(z) \right] \\ &= (t-s)L\left(\frac{y-z}{s} \right) \\ &=hL\left(\frac{y-z}{s} \right).
\end{align} 
  That is, $$\frac{u(x,t)-u((1-\frac ht)x+\frac htz,t-h)}{h} \ge L\left(\frac{x-z}{t} \right).$$ 
  Let $h \rightarrow 0^+$, to see that $$\underbrace{\frac{x-z}{t} \cdot Du(x,t)+u_t(x,t)}_{\color{#009900}{\text{How is the limit definition of derivative applied here exactly?}}} \ge L\left(\frac{x-z}{t} \right).$$ 
  Consequently, \begin{align}
u_t(x,t)+H(Du(x,t))&=u_t(x,t)+\max_{v\in\mathbb{R}^n} \{v \cdot Du(x,t)-L(v) \} \\
&\ge u_t(x,t)+\frac{x-z}{t} \cdot Du(x,t)-L\left(\frac{x-z}{t} \right) \\ &\ge 0
\end{align}

Let $f:X\rightarrow [0,\infty]$ be a measurable function, which means that the inverse of each borel set of $[0,\infty]$ under $f$ is an element of $\mathfrak{M}$. In measure theory, we define it's integration as the supremum of $\sum_{x\in s(X)} x\mu(s^{-1}(x))$ where $s$ is a simple measurable fuction such that $s≦f$. The point is, the role of $\mu$ only acts on those simple functions $s$, not $f$ directly. What would go wrong if one defines integration for an arbitrary function $f$?

I was looking for a (relatively) quick algorithm for numerically identifying fixed points and their stability, and found a helpful pdf that claims a system of equations with $F(\vec{X})=\vec{0}$ can be solved by minimizing $\sum_i F^2_i(\vec{X})$ using a Steepest Decent technique. So I set $F(\vec{X}^*)=D(\vec{X}^*)-\vec{X}^*$ and implemented an algorithm for minimization, and it seems to work well at finding fixed points. Stability analysis is as simple as checking that all the eigenvalues are within the unit circle. However, in some cases the system in question produces limit cycles. Since I am mostly experienced with Continuous Time Dynamical Systems I guessed by analogy that the minimum found by the steepest decent algorithm found the 'center' of the cycle. In retrospect, this seems exceedingly unlikely. My questions: 1.Is this intuition correct at least in some cases, i.e. can I expect some fixed point $\vec{X}_c$ that is the 'center' of the cycle? If so, in which cases? 2.If this is the case, can I identify it as a center (as opposed to some other stable or unstable fixed point) by the eigenvalues or by some other method? 3.If this is not the case, how can I identify cases in which the system cycles?

If $f: A \to B$ is continuous when restricted to both $X$ and $Y$ , then $f$ is continuous.

Therefore, their union, f^{-1}(U) is also closed.

So do we get $\gamma_1(s)=(1,0,0)^ts+(0,1,0)^t(1-s)$ or $\gamma_1(s)=(0,1,0)^ts+(1,0,0)^t(1-s)$ for $s\in[0,1]$? From where do you consider the ""anticlockwise direction""? I would guess we are looking from $(0,0,0)^t$. But if you're looking from outside the triangle we get the other way around. I am a bit confussed. In one or two dimensions it's easy to see but in higher dimensions not. So from where are you looking at the triangle?","['calculus', 'integration', 'vector-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
838651,A surprising locus of points,"I was playing with the setup for Desargues Theorem in Geogebra today and got a very odd-looking (to me) result. I imagine I could grind through this analytically and get an ugly-looking parametric representation of it but I'm more interested to know whether anyone recognises these curves by sight and can attach a name to them. This is mostly a matter of idle curiosity at this point: The red one looks like an elliptic curve to me, but the green one doesn't. The setup is a bit convoluted to describe but here goes in case you want to try this at home: Take an arbitrary disjoint pair of ellipses. Join their foci in pairs (orange lines). Pick any point on the right ellipse (A) and project it to the point where those two orange lines intersect (P) (red line). One of the points where this intersects the left ellipse is identified. The foci of each ellipse, together with one of the two points on its edge thus identified, form a triangle (black lines). By construction, the two triangles are in perspective . Each triangle fully determines its corresponding ellipse. Construct points as in Desargues Theorem: produce all the sides of the triangles (dark blue dotted lines for the right-hand triangle, light blue for the left-hand one). Place a point were corresponding lines intersect. We'll call these the D-points. As the theorem predicts, they are collinear (dotted purple line). Turn on ""trace"" for the three points. This will plot the locus of each point when it moves. Take the point on the right ellipse and move it around the ellipse. The result is the thick green and red lines. The red curve is the locus of one of D-points, the green is the two-branched locus of another; the third D-point (blue) remains stationary (this is not surprising; it's the point of intersection of the two lines joining the foci, which aren't moving).","['geometry', 'locus', 'projective-geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'conic-sections']"

838732,Degree of ample bundle over projective curve is positive,"(From Vakil's notes, Exercise 18.4.K)
If $C$ is an integral projective curve over a field $k$, and $\mathscr{L}$ is an ample line bundle on $C$, why is the degree of $\mathscr{L}>0$? If $C$ is also a regular curve, then I think I can do this, as it can be quickly checked that ${\rm deg}(\mathscr{L}^{\otimes n}) = n {\rm deg}(\mathscr{L})$ and, if $\mathscr{L}$ is very ample, there exists a global section (and that section must vanish somewhere or else our very ample bundle is trivial). However, I don't see how to extend this argument to the case where the curve might not be regular. The degree of a coherent sheaf is defined in the notes as 
\begin{align*}
{\rm deg}(\mathscr{F}):=\chi(C,\mathscr{F}) - ({\rm rank} \mathscr{F})\chi(C,\mathscr{O}_C)
\end{align*} As one possible useful fact, Exercise 18.4.S seems to say that we can express $\mathscr{L}$ as $\mathscr{O}_C(\sum{n_ip_i})$ where $p_i$ are regular points that are not associated points. I don't know why this is true, but it would at least allow us to view $\mathscr{L}$ more concretely (in particular, repeating the argument for Riemann Roch for regular projective curves tells us the degree of $\mathscr{L}$). However, even assuming this fact, I would need to know be able to compute the degree of $\mathscr{L}$ using the zeros and poles of a global section to use the argument above.","['algebraic-geometry', 'projective-schemes']"

It should be noted that (a,b,c), (b,a,c) and all such permutation will be considered as the same triplets. EXAMPLE : Let N=5 and edges with colors are as follow : 1 2 b
2 3 r
3 4 r
4 5 b Here answer will be 4. EXPLANATION : (2,3,4) is one such triplet because on all paths i.e 2 to 3, 3 to 4 and 2 to 4 there is atleast one edge having read color. (2,3,5), (1,3,4) and (1,3,5) are such other triplets. Here is my approach : Count the triplets that don't have this property, and subtract from the total number of triplets. If you have a path made entirely of black edges, any third node will create such a triplet, so there are N-2 such triplets. Counting the all-black paths involves removing all red edges and measuring the resultant black sub-trees (O(N)). A black tree containing K+1 nodes contains K(K+1)/2 paths. Once you have the number of such triplets, subtract from the number of all triplets (N(N-1)(N-2)/6), and you have your answer in O(N).

838953,Name for a body that can be completely described using its silhouettes,"I'm shooting blind over here because I have no background in this field of mathematics. I assume that if you have a body (in $\mathbb{R}^3$), you can call it convex if any segment from one point inside of the body to another point inside of it is completely contained in the body. But what would you call the attribute that the shape of the body can be completely determined by rotating it and looking at it's 2D projection on a surface? For example, imagine a cylinder that you curve into the shape of the letter $C$. The body that you get isn't convex, but if you imagine how it's silhouette would look you could completely describe it. Ok, so to give another point of view and hopefully better describe what I mean, imagine this.
You have a block of clay. In front of the clay is a surface. On the surface, there's a projection of the body under some rotation. What you do is, from the current point of view, cut out all the clay that's ""not in the silhouette"", cookie cutter style. Then you rotate the block of clay around itself but keep the surface between you and it. The surface doesn't move, but the projection changes as if you were rotating the body that's projected. For each rotation you repeat the cutting out. Now, the bodies that I'm describing would be identical to the end result of the clay cutting, and the bodies that don't have this attribute would have less volume than the thing you get from cutting the clay. A red blood cell, for example, is something that you couldn't make like this because it has that dimple in the middle that will simply have no effect on the silhouette no matter how you rotate it.","['geometry', 'tomography', 'terminology', 'projective-geometry']"

839303,Write the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation,"Consider the following stochastic optimal control problem. \begin{equation}
V(t,x) = \max_{u}\,\, \log \left(\mathbb{E}\left[\int_{0}^{T} u^{2}(t)dt\right]\right)
\end{equation} subject to the dynamic contsraint \begin{equation}
dx(t) = x(t)[(r + u(\mu-r))dt + \sigma u w(t)] \, ; \,\,x(0)=x>0
\end{equation} where $u$ is the control process to be chosen, $\mu, r, 
\sigma$ are positive constants and $w$ is a standard Brownian motion. My question is how to write the HJB equation for this problem. My approach this far \begin{align}
V_t(t,x) + x(r + u(\mu-r))V_{x}(t,x) + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}x^{2}V_{xx} + \log(u^{2})
\end{align}
where $V_{t}, V_{x}, V_{xx}$ respresent the partial derivatives of the function $V$ with respect to $t,x$. Is this ok ?","['stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-analysis', 'stochastic-integrals', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
839305,Probablity of drawing all the red balls while blue and green are still left,"Suppose that a box contains 10 red balls, 20 green balls, and 30 blue balls. Suppose also that balls are drawn from the box one at a time at random. What is the probability that all the red balls are drawn before the blue or green balls are themselves exhausted. What is the probability that as the last red ball is drawn, there remains at least one blue and one green left in the box. The answer I was given is $\dfrac{7}{12}$ and a general equation is:
$$
\dfrac{b g}{1-b}+\dfrac{b g}{1-g}
$$ where
$$
g=\dfrac{20}{60},b=\dfrac{30}{60}
$$

839310,Binary sequence count of unique patterns,"A binary sequence is a sequence of 1s and 0s, and there are $2^n$ such sequences of length $n$. Define the ""pattern"" as the number of consecutive $1$s in the sequence. For example, when $n=5$, the sequence $11010$ has pattern $[2,1]$ and the sequence $10011$ has pattern $[1,2]$. These two are of different patterns. When $n=3$, there are $5$ patterns for total $2^3$ sequences: [0]: 000
[1]: 001, 010,100
[2]: 011,110
[1,1]: 101
[3]: 111 So, the question is: for binary sequence with length $n$, how many patterns are there? Denoted by $a_n$. It seems to be related to the Fibonacci numbers. If true, please help to prove it. Thank you.","['sequences-and-series', 'combinatorics']"

839357,"Understanding the proof of $|ST||S\cap T| = |S||T|$ where $S, T$ are subgroups of a finite group","I'm trying to understand the proof of the following theorem: Theorem 2.20 (Product Formula). If $S$ and $T$ are subgroups of a finite group $G$, then $$|ST|\, |S \cap T| = |S|\,|T|.$$ Remark. The subset $ST$ need not be a subgroup. Proof. Define a function $\varphi: S \times T \to ST$ by $(s, t) \mapsto st$. Since $\varphi$ is a surjection, it suffices to show that if $x \in ST$, then $|\varphi^{-1}(x)| = |S \cap T|$. We show that $\varphi^{-1}(x) = \{(sd, d^{-1}t): d \in S \cap T\}$. It is clear that $\varphi^{-1}(x)$ contains the right side. For the reverse inclusion, let $(s, t), (\sigma, \tau) \in \varphi^{-1}(x)$; that is, $s, \sigma \in S$, $t, \tau \in T$, and $st = x = \sigma \tau$. Thus, $s^{-1}\sigma = t\tau^{-1} \in S \cap T$; let $d = s^{-1}\sigma = t\tau^{-1}$ denote their common value. Then $\sigma = s(s^{-1}\sigma) = sd$ and $d^{-1}t = \tau t^{-1}t = \tau$, as desired. $\quad \square$ I think they're using that 
\begin{equation}\tag{1}
S \times T = \text{Dom} \varphi = \bigcup_{x \in \text{Im}\varphi} \varphi^{-1}(x) = \bigcup_{x \in ST} \varphi^{-1}(x),
\end{equation}
and so,
$$|S||T|=|S \times T|=\sum_{x \in ST} |\varphi^{-1}(x)| = \sum_{x \in ST} |S \cap T| = |ST||S\cap T|.$$
But if that's what they're using, I don't understand why they say ""Since $\varphi$ is a surjection, it suffices..."", because to prove $(1)$ we don't need that $\phi$ is a surjection, it's valid for all functions. So, why do they say that?","['proof-explanation', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
839385,How to perform a monotonic function fitting of data points?,"I'm seeking suggestions for general purpose function fitting of a set of data points, where, based on physical intuition, the relationship is expected to be ""monotonic"", i.e. the function should be strictly increasing (or decreasing) itself as well as its first few derivatives. The points in question are ratios $r=c/a$ of lattice constants $c$ and $a$ of hexagonal Fe-N lattice as a function of volume $x$. I'm currently just using a third order polynomial, but I don't like the unphysical behavior in rightmost part here (some errors in the values are expected): Another sample is this: Due to limited number of points to be fitted, I'd expect no more than 3-4 fitting parameters. The fitting doesn't need to be solvable in closed form as I have to use a non-linear optimizer for other reasons ( IPOPT through my own abstraction library FuncLib , in case anyone is interested).","['interpolation', 'regression', 'least-squares', 'functions']"
839392,Fractional Brownian motion---construction via Hilbert space?,"The Brownian motion has the following (Levy-Ciesielski?) construction via Hilbert space isomorphisms: Let $\{ Z_i \}_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}$ be i.i.d. $N(0,1)$ random variables defined on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$. Let $\{ \phi_i \}_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}$ be an orthonormal basis for $L^2[0, \infty)$. The map $\phi_i \mapsto Z_i $ extends to an isometry $B$ from $L^2[0, \infty)$ to a subspace of $L^2(\Omega)$. The process defined by $B_t(\omega) = B(1_{[0,t]})(\omega)$ is a version of Brownian motion. Does this extend in some way to the fractional Brownian motion?","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'hilbert-spaces', 'reference-request']"
