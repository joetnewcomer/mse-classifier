2309114,"Sample mean, without replacement","I'm going through a statistics course and I'm having some difficulties with the point estimation. It makes sense to me in basic examples, but as soon as the ""without replacement"" examples got introduced, I got stuck. Here's an example: A box has $4$ numbered balls, $1$ , $2$ , $3$ and $4$ . A sample of $2$ is drawn without replacement. What is the expected sample mean? For $1$ ball it's $\frac{1}{4} \sum X_i$ , which is $2.5$ . Simple so far. Once one ball is extracted, the probabilities change for the others, but since I don't know which ball number was removed, I can't use the same formula. What shall I do? I would really appreciate some advice and pointers. Thanks in advance.","['statistics', 'probability']"

2309169,Find the error in theta for noisy points in $R^2$,"Assume I have two points in $R^2$: $P_{t=0} = (x_1, y_1)$ and $P_{t=1} = (x_2, y_2)$ at $t=1$ I want to calculate the heading angle/orientation of the particle.
Both points have measurement noise of N, and the noise is constant. To calculate the orientation: $\theta = arctan2((x_{1} - x_{2}), (y_{1} - y_{2}))$ However, I need some uncertainty around $\theta$, that accounts for the noisy x and y values. I know the methods of error propagation for powers, multiplication, subtraction and addition, but I don't understand how to propagate uncertainty in a trigonometric function. EDIT: I have done the following to try and calculate an error on theta. $ \delta( \ atan2(\Delta x, \Delta y) \ ) = \sqrt{\Sigma_{i} \ \ \big(\delta(a_i) . \frac{d(atan2(\Delta x, \Delta y))}{da_i}}\big)^2$ Where:
$ a_i \ \epsilon \ [\Delta x, \Delta y]$ $ \Delta x = x_1 - x_2 \ \ \ $
$ \Delta y = y_1 - y_2$ $\frac{d(atan2(\Delta x, \Delta y))}{da_i}$ is the partial derivative of atan2. $\delta(a_i)$ is effectively the noise on $\Delta x \ or  \ \Delta y$ i.e. $\delta(\Delta x)$ or $\delta(\Delta y)$ depending on $i$. $\delta(\Delta x) = \sqrt{ N^2 + N^2 }$ I DO not propagate error when calculating the partial derivative of arctan2. Should I be doing this? I tried to test this error on $\theta$, by computing a Gaussian of theta and the error. In about ten random samples of this distribution, I get perhaps one value that is indeed close to theta. But it seems a bit poor - not good enough of an error for theta.","['trigonometry', 'error-propagation']"

  $n=1,2,3\dots$ and multiplies it with its reverse value (reverse digits) in number base $x$,
  then takes the square root of the product. After that, raise it to the
  power of $-s$ as you would for zeta(s). As you can see, if $n$ is a palindrome in number base $x$, then it remains $n$. Otherwise, it becomes the $\sqrt{n\times\overline{n}}$ where $\overline{n}$ is the number $n$, but its digits are reversed when written in number base $x$. The value of ""Reverse Zeta $x$"" of $s$ tends to $\zeta{(s)}$ as $x$ grows bigger. Suppose we take the limit $x\to\infty$, then we have a normal zeta function. It's because that makes the number base a base where each number is a single symbol (one digit), meaning all $n$s reverse back to $n$. Does something on this already exist somewhere or is this the first time this
  is mentioned? How can we check when this will converge for a given $x$? I suppose the bound slightly varies based on $x$ and converges to that the real part of $s$ must be $\gt1$ as $x$ tends to $\infty$? Can one find closed forms for some $x$ and some $s$? For example, what is the (is there a) closed form of this when $x=2$ and $s=2$ ? Can we express the ""reverse $x$ zeta function"" in the terms of the zeta function?

I was trying to do it just with the recurrence formula and the fact that $I_1 = \frac1e$, with induction. I tried proving $I_k < \frac{1}{k+1}$ but in proving it I ended up needing to assume that $\frac{1}{k+1} < I_{k-1}$. So basically I wanted to prove $$\frac{1}{k+2} < I_k < \frac{1}{k+1} \tag{1}$$ I verified it for $k$ up to $10$ so it does feel like it should be true. With induction, proving $I_k < \frac{1}{k+1}$ assuming (1), is trivial. However, when I try to prove $\frac{1}{k+2} < I_k$ I end up with $$I_{k-1} < \frac{1}{k}\frac{k+1}{k+2}$$ which made me write $$I_{k-1} < \frac{1}{k}\frac{k+1}{k+2} < \frac{1}{k}, \text{true, by the induction hypothesis}$$ However, I can't do this. I know $I_{k-1}< \frac{1}{k}$ but that does not let me write what I wrote nor prove what I want to prove. Is there anyone out there able to lend me a hand? The ideal would be to use induction to prove (1). If I fail to do that, the second ideal thing would be to use induction to prove that the $I_k$, starting at some $k_0$, are bounded by something that does not increase. It can even be a constant. For example, showing $I_k < 1\ \forall k$ would be good enough for my purposes.

2309918,On 5-adic representation of square root of -1,"Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_5$ be the solution to $f(x):=x^2+1=0$ such that $\alpha \equiv 2 \, (\text{mod} \,5)$ (that we obtain by Hensel's lemma). Then $$ \alpha = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \, 5^k$$
where $a_0=2$ and $0\leq a_{n+1}<5$  is the only integer such that  $a_{n+1}\equiv f(S_n)/5^{n+1}  \, (\text{mod} \,5)$ where $S_n=\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k \, 5^k$. Similarly if $b_0=3$ and $0\leq b_{n+1}<5$  is the only integer such that  $b_{n+1}\equiv -f(T_n)/5^{n+1}  \, (\text{mod} \,5)$ where $T_n=\sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k \, 5^k$, then $$ \beta = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} b_k \, 5^k$$ would give us the other root (i.e. $\beta=-\alpha$). I have some numerical evidence that suggest the following inequalities should be true for all $l \geq 2$ $$ 5^{2(l-4)}\leq  \sum_{k=l+1}^{2l-1} a_k \, 5^k $$
$$ 5^{2(l-4)}\leq  \sum_{k=l+1}^{2l-1} b_k \, 5^k  $$ Here I plot $2(l-4)/\log_5 \left( \sum_{k=l+1}^{2l-1} a_k \, 5^k \right)$ for $2\leq l \leq5000$ note that it's always bounded by 1 , and here I do the same for  $2(l-4)/\log_5 \left( \sum_{k=l+1}^{2l-1} b_k \, 5^k \right)$. (sorry for the quality I'm not allow to embed images yet, just links) The reason I'm interested in this inequalities is that they would give a way to prove that the only solutions for $n^2 + 1 = 2 \times 5^m$ with $n\geq 0$ are $(n,m) = (1,0),(3,1), (7, 2)$. Indeed, let $(m,n)$ be a solution then $(n-\alpha)(n-\beta)=2 \times 5^m$, also $(n-\alpha)-(n-\beta)=-2\alpha$, thus either $n-\alpha$ or $n-\beta$ have $5$-adic valuation equal to $m$ and the other valuation $0$, let's say $n-\alpha$ have valuation $m$, then since 
$0\leq n =\sqrt{2 \times 5^m -1}<5^m$ (at least for $m \geq 1$), and $n$ is an integer we must have $$n=\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} a_k \, 5^k$$ Now write $m=2l+r$ for $r\in\{0,1\}$, diving by $5^l$ we have that $$a_{0}5^{-l}+\ldots +a_{l}+ a_{l+1}5+\ldots+ a_{m-1}5^{l+r-1}=\frac{n}{5^l}\leq \sqrt{2 \times 5^r -5^{-2l}}<\sqrt{10}<5 $$ but that would imply $a_{l+1}=0,a_{l+2}=0, \ldots,a_{m-1}=a_{2l+r-1}=0$ that would clearly contradic the first inequality, we could do the same if the valuation of $n-\beta$ is the one that is $m$ leading us to contradiction again, thus $l\in \{0,1 \}$ and the given solutions are the only ones. My questions are: 1. Is my reasoning ok? 2. Are this inequalities true? 2. Can we prove this inequalities? 3. Can we at least prove the RHS's are nonzero? Update: Thank to the answer of @Gerry Myerson I realized that the real question I should be asking it's whether or not the $a_k$'s are evenly distributed in $\{0,1,2,3,4\}$, if that the case acording to this we should expect to be a run of $\geq r$ zeros in the first $n$ of the $a_k$'s if $n \approx (1/4)5^{r+1}$. With this in mind I've found  a run of 6 zeros from $k=12412$ to $k=12417$, with a little more efford we could find a run of 8 zeros that would prove the inequality wrong (that would require $k$ to be roughly $500000$ but I don't see the point in doing it). However theses are still good news because if they're indeed evenly distributed, then $ \sum_{k=l+1}^{2l-1} a_k \, 5^k \neq 0$ because otherwise almost half of the $a_k$'s would be zero not $1/5$, and that's all we need for the diophantine equation. So, Are there any result on ""normality"" of  p-adic square roots ?. At
 least one powerfull enough to prove $ \sum_{k=l+1}^{2l-1} a_k \, 5^k \neq 0$ for all $l$ bigger than some effective bound ?.","['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory']"

2309992,Can every polyhedron be inscribed in a sphere?,"Given any $n$-dimensional convex polyhedron in $\Bbb R^n$. Question: Is it always possible to find a combinatorially equivalent polyhedron with vertices only on the sphere $S^{n-1}\subset\Bbb R^n$, i.e. an equivalent sphere inscribed polyhedron? One can also ask it this way: can I build (from a combinatorial point of view) any polyhedron by choosing some points on a sphere and taking the convex hull? I mean, this is easy to see for polyhedra whose faces are all simplices, but it seems pretty hard in general. You cannot just project all vertices to the sphere because ""coplanar"" vertices might be no longer ""coplanar"" afterwards, hence cannot describe an equivalent face. Extra: If not in general, is it possible for $n=3$? Can this be made easier by allowing the vertices to be on any sphere $S^m$ with $m\geq n-1$. Update: I should have been more precise. The sphere inscribed polyhedron should be convex too. Also, preferrably no two distinct faces of the polyhedron should be coplanar, otherwise they can be combined to a single face. In this sense, the Triakis tetrahedron is indeed a counter-example to my question. There are inscribed polyhedra equivalent to it, but they are either not convex or have coplanar faces .","['polyhedra', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'geometry']"
2309996,Lebesgue outer measure of image of function with bounded derivative,"I encountered the following problem in my real analysis course this past semester: Let $f$ be a real-valued function on $[a,b]$. Suppose that $E \subset [a,b]$ and that $f'$ exists and is bounded on $E$, say, by $M$. Prove that $\lambda^*(f(E)) \leq M\lambda^*(E)$. (source: Exercise 8.18 in A Course in Real Analysis 2nd Ed., by McDonald and Weiss) Here is what I have so far: Consider the special case when $E$ is an open set. Then $E$ is the disjoint union of countably many open intervals $(I_n)_n$. Pick any such open interval $I_n$. Let $x,y \in I_n$. By the Mean Value Theorem, $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq M|x-y|$. But $|x-y| \leq \lambda^*(I_n)$. Therefore $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq M\lambda^*(I_n)$ for any $x,y \in I_n$. It follows that $\lambda^*(f(I_n)) \leq M\lambda^*(I_n)$. Summing over all $n$ and using subadditivity of Lebesgue outer measure yields the desired inequality. For an arbitrary set $E$, I considered using the formal definition of Lebesgue outer measure. Pick a countable set of open intervals $(I_n)_n$ that covers $E$. I may assume without loss of generality that the sum of lengths is within some $\epsilon > 0$ of $\lambda^*(E)$. Then I wish to show that there is some countable set of open intervals $(J_n)_n$ that covers $f(E)$ so that $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty l(f(J_n)) \leq M\sum_{n=1}^\infty l(f(I_n)).$$ However, this seems to me equally insoluble. The fact that $f'$ may not be bounded and may not even exist outside $E$ seems to make things particularly complicated, since an interval $I_n$ may not be contained in $E$.

2310109,Showing that a subset of a set of functions is closed.,"I'm an undergraduate with little to no background in functional analysis and topology. The whole concept of function spaces is quite fuzzy to me, and I'm having a difficult time conceptualizing it. (Things like there being different notions of compactness in general topological spaces is one of many things confusing me because of what I've learned so far. I have learned many things which turn out to be true only in metric spaces, or in $\mathbb{R}^n$ specifically.) Consider the following situation: Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $[a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$. Let $F$ denote the set of all functions from $A$ to $[a, b]$, and $G \subset F$ denote those functions which possess a particular attribute that we are interested in. In order to finish a larger proof, I'd like to show that $G$ is closed; later on, I want to work with pointwise convergence of functions in $G$. Since we are dealing with a function space, I'm a bit unsure about how to do this, because I'm uncertain about what constitutes a limit point in this space. I have showed that, for any sequence $(f_n)_1^\infty$ of functions in $G$ converging pointwise to some $f \in F$, $f$ must be in $G$. I believe that this shows that $G$ is closed, and I believe that it has to do with the connection between the product topology and pointwise convergence of functions, but I would really appreciate feedback on this; have I misunderstood what ""closed set"" means in this context? Thanks! EDIT: In my case, $G \subset F$ is the set of all functions $f:A \rightarrow [a, b]$ such that $f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = c(f)$, for any three pair-wise orthogonal unit vectors $a, b, c$, where $c(f)$ is a constant depending only on $f$. Second attempt: Take any function $f \in F \setminus G$. There exist two sets of orthogonal unit vectors $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ and $(v_4, v_5, v_6)$ such that
\begin{equation*}
\Delta = \left| \sum_{i=1}^3 f(v_i) - f(v_{i + 3}) \right| > 0.
\end{equation*}
The set
\begin{equation*}
B_{\Delta/6} = \{ f \in F : \max(|f(v_i) - g(v_i)|) < \Delta / 6, i = 1, 2, \dots 6 \}.
\end{equation*}
is an open neighborhood of $f$. Take any $g \in B_{\Delta/6}$, and let $\delta_i = g(v_i) - f(v_i)$, for $i = 1, 2, \dots 6$, so that $|\delta_i| < \Delta / 6$. We get
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\left| \sum_{i=1}^3 (g(v_i) - g(v_{i+3})) \right| = \left| \sum_{i=1}^3 (f(v_i) + \delta_i - f(v_{i+3}) - \delta_{i+3}) \right| \geq\\
\left| \sum_{i=1}^3 (f(v_i) - f(v_{i+3})) \right| - \left|\sum_{i=1}^3 (\delta_{i+3} - \delta_i) \right|
= \Delta - \left|\sum_{i=1}^3 (\delta_{i+3} - \delta_i) \right| > \Delta - \Delta = 0,
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
using the reverse triangle inequality. Thus $g \in F \setminus G$, so that $B_{ \Delta / 6} \subset F \setminus G$, meaning $F \setminus G$ is open. We conclude that $(F \setminus G)^C = G$ is closed. Any thoughts?","['general-topology', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

Trouble is, I don't get how it works. Jaynes seems to be trying to find a change of variables for a pdf such that the new pdf, multiplied by the Jacobian determinant of the new parameterization, results in the exact same pdf as before the transformation. Then, he tries to find a prior distribution for a given set of parameters such that the prior distribution, when run through the same change of variables and multiplied by the same Jacobian determinant, remains the same. His notation is a little vague, so here's my interpretation of one of his examples. Let's say you have a reparameterization of $\frac{1}{\sigma}f(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})dx$, denoted $\Phi$, where $\Phi(x,\mu, \sigma)=(a(x+b),a(\mu+b),a\sigma)$, where $a$ and $b$ are arbitrary values.. Plugging these new variables into $\frac{1}{\sigma}f(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})dx$, we have $\frac{1}{a\sigma}f(\frac{a(x+b)-a(\mu+b)}{a\sigma})dx'\mathbf{J_{\Phi}}$, which simplifies to: $\frac{1}{a\sigma}f(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})dx'

$ ... which isn't the same as the original, though Jaynes says that it is. He then proceeds to take the Jacobian and apply it to a prior, which I also don't understand how he's able to do. Aren't Jacobian determinants supposed to multidimensional versions of the coefficient of $du$ in $u$ substitution? Why is Jaynes able to multiply one seemingly unrelated function by the Jacobian determinant of another?

2310376,Uniform boundedness principle and convergence of Fourier series,"I am reading 'A Panorama of Harmonic Analysis"" by S. Krantz, and on page 67, he writes; ($D_N$ here denotes the Dirichlet kernel) The point of the last paragraph is worth belaboring. For each $N$, let $\phi_N(t)$ be the function that equals +1 when $D_N(t)\geq0$ and equals -1 when $D_N(t)<0$. Of course $\phi_N(t)$ is discontinuous. But now let $\psi_N(t)$ be a continuous function, bounded in absolute vale by 1, which agrees with $\phi_N$ except in a very small interval about each point where $\phi_N$ changes sign. Integrate $D_N$ against $\psi_N$. The calculation alluded at the start of the section then shows that the value of the integral is about $c\cdot\log N$, even though $\psi_N$ has supremum norm 1. The uniform boundedness principle now tells us that convergence for partial summation in norm fails dramatically for continuous functions on the circle group. I'm having trouble understanding that last sentence. What does he mean by 'fails dramatically'? How is the uniform boundedness principle used here? Let us denote the circle group by $\mathbb{T}$ and let $S_N f(t)$ be the $N$th partial sum of the Fourier series of a given function $f:\mathbb{T}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$. Does he mean that the family of continuous functions (on the circle group) which $S_N f(t)$ does not converges to $f$ in uniform norm, is dense in $C(\mathbb{T})$?

2310393,Is there a norm on the space of bounded functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ continuous at the origin?,"For the space of continuous and bounded functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, we can always define the supremum norm without any problems. I say that a function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ is bounded if the function $|f|: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is bounded in the standard sense. (I don't know if this is standard terminology. Also note that $| \cdot|$ denotes the modulus.) Questions: 1. Can we use the supremum norm on bounded continuous functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ to define a norm on the space of bounded continuous functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$? 2. If so, can we take this even further and find a norm on the space of bounded functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ continuous at the origin (but not necessarily anywhere else)? Motivation: By Bochner's theorem , the characteristic function $f$ of any finite measure on $\mathbb{R}$ with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra inherited from the Euclidean topology is continuous at the origin and bounded by $f(0)$ . So if such a norm as asked for in 2. exists, it would provide another way to define a topology on the space of such finite measures, due to the one to one correspondence between finite measures on $\mathbb{R}$ and their characteristic functions.

Then there is a bounded set $B\subset Y$ such that $\Gamma(K)\subset B$. I understand the proof of the theorem BUT:
$K$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space, so by Baire's theorem is of second cathegory. By Banach Steinhaus theorem $\Gamma|_K$ is an equicontinuous collection of linear maps, thus (theorem 2.4)  $\Gamma|_K$ are equibounded. Finally since $K$ is bounded  $\Gamma|_K(K)=\Gamma (K)$ is a bounded subset of $Y$.

If the surface flux integral of the vector field is equal to some positive constant, then the magnitude of the field is not constant on the boundary of the sphere. This means that the field at some point has to grow more than it shrinks inside the sphere, resulting in a divergence $\neq 0$. So obviously $4\pi \neq 0$...

But I am a quick study, and have found the function mesmerizing since I first saw it's relation to primes in high school. Why can we extend the zeta function from $\{\Re(s) > 1\} $ to $\{\Re(s) > 0\} $? As a friendly reminder,
$$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac1{n^s}$$ which converges for $\Re(s) > 1$ by the integral test, and diverges for all other values. By multiplying through by $(1-2^{1-s}) $ (and later dividing by it), we arrive at an alternate identity: $$\zeta(s) = \frac1{1-2^{1-s}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^s}$$
By the alternating series test, this converges for $\Re(s) > 0$ with $\Re(s) \ne 1$. In this way, we've extended the domain, however, it seems contradictory to me, as the former definition implies divergence for $0 <\Re(s) <1$, and the later implies convergence in this region. My thoughts were that the integral test perhaps does not apply the same way for $s \in \mathbb{C} $ as it did for $s \in \mathbb{R} $, but I don't see off-hand why this same dichotomy wouldn't happen if $s \in \mathbb{R}$, as the derivation didn't seem to rely on complex numbers.

2310961,Is there a deeper reason why these special points of a function form a geometric sequence?,"If we consider the function $f(x) = \ln^2(x) - \ln(x)$ over $(0, +\infty)$, we can note the following: $f(x) = 0$ at two points A and C of abscissas $x_A = 1$ and $x_C = e$ (the roots of the function). $f'(x) = 0$ at the point B of abscissa $x_B = e^{1/2}$ (the global minimum of the function) $f''(x) = 0$ (and changes signs) at D of abscissa $x_D = e^{3/2}$ (the inflection point of the function). These four notable points A, B, C and D on the curve form a geometric sequence of common ratio $r = e^{1/2}$ and first term $u_0 = 1$. Do the next terms carry any significance in the function? Is there a specific, 'deeper' reason behind this? Is this just a fluke, or is this behavior exhibited in a general class of functions? I also noted that the similar function $g(x) = \ln^2(x) + \ln(x)$ has a similar pattern (the intersection points, minimum and inflection point form a geometric sequence with ratio $r$ and first term $v_0 = e^{-1/2}$), which is what led me to suspect that this could be a common theme among a class of functions.","['logarithms', 'sequences-and-series', 'functions']"

2311058,Countable number of arcs between two intervals,"First consider the two intervals $I_0=\{0\}\times [0,1]$ and $I_1=\{1\}\times [0,1]$ in the plane. Suppose that, for each $n\in\omega=\{0,1,2,...\}$, $A_n$ is an arc (a homeomorphic image of $[0,1]$) contained in $\mathbb [0,1]^2 \setminus (I_0\cup I_1)$ except for having one endpoint in $I_0$ and the other endpoint in $I_1$. And suppose $A_i\cap A_j=\varnothing$ when $i\neq j$. We may assume $A_0=[0,1]\times \{0\}$ and $A_1=[0,1]\times \{1\}$. It seems intuitively true that there should be an arc $A\subseteq [0,1]^2$ between $I_0$ and $I_1$ that misses $\bigcup _{n\in\omega} A_n$. Is this true? MY ATTEMPT: First consider the entire closed connected region $T_0=[0,1]^2$
  between $A_0$ and $A_1$ (as defined above). If there is no other $A_n$ in $T_0$, then we're done (the arc $A$ is
  easy to find). Otherwise, choose the least $n>1$ such that $A_n\subseteq T_0$. Get a tube $T_1$ (homeomorphic to $[0,1]^2$) between $A_1$ and $A_n$.
  So $T_1\cap A_0=\varnothing$. Now get $T_2$ by going from $A_n$ to $A_m$, where $m>n$ is least index
  of any arc $A_m\subseteq T_1$. We can continue this process to get a nested sequence of compact
  connected tubes $T_n$, so that $T_n$ misses $A_{n-1}$ for each
  $n<\omega$. Then $T:=\bigcap T_n$ is a compact connected set from $I_0$ to $I_1$
  that misses all $A_n$'s.   But does it contain an arc from $I_0$ to $I_1$? EDIT (June 23): There are now two answers below, which claim opposite things.  I'll try to figure out which argument is flawed, but would appreciate any help.  Please note that I proved (above) that there is a continuum between $I_0$ and $I_1$ which misses all arcs $A_n$.  So does this mean @Colin 's answer is flawed? Regarding @Santana 's answer: Think about a sequence of arcs doing this. So $$A_0=[0,1]\times \{0\}$$ and for $n>0$, $$A_n=\text{graph of the function } f_n:[0,1]\to \mathbb R \text{ where }f_n (x)=\frac{1}{2}|2x-1|+\frac{1}{2^n}.$$ This is not homeomorphic to any collection of horizontal arcs. Moreover this shows you cannot start at an arbitrary remaining endpoint.  Every arc beginning at a point in $\{0\}\times (0,1/2)$ and ending in $I_1$ must intersect some $A_n$.",['general-topology']

They presented a problem in which one of the steps was: $y + zy$ And they translated this to: $y(1 + z)$ Now, in standard algebra, this is pretty straightforward, but it doesn't seem to make sense in terms of the definition they provided. In this case, $y = a = c$ and $z = b$, so by the definition above: $y + zy = (y + z)(y + y)$ By the idempotent law, this should be: $y(y + z)$ Could someone please help clarify this?

I am guranteed at least one per coin. My job now is to tell him which
coin is better; i.e. which one has a higher probability of showing
heads. The obvious way to do this would be to estimate the probabilities from
the samples, however this seems wrong to me because I am not taking
into account how accurate my estimates are. E.g., consider
the case where: Coin 1 has shown 501 heads and 499 tails. Coin 2 has shown 2 heads and 1 tails. I tried approaching this in a few ways, and all of those quickly
showed me how little I know about probability theory and statistics. My question has four main points: Does this problem depend on how the coin probabilities are distributed?

I thought the fastest way was to use the Leibniz's rule for the derivative of a product,
$$
(f\cdot g)' = f'g + g'f
$$
and, choosing as $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ and as $g(x) = \int_0^x\arctan(e^t)\mathrm{d}t$, applying for the second one's derivative the fundamental theorem of calculus, I obtained
$$
-\frac{1}{x^2}\int_0^x\arctan(e^t)\mathrm{d}t + \frac{1}{x}\left[\arctan(e^t)\right]\Bigg|_{t = 0}^{t = x} = -\frac{1}{x^2}\int_0^x\arctan(e^t)\mathrm{d}t + \frac{1}{x}\left[\arctan(e^x)-\frac{\pi}{4}\right]

I tried to evaluate the whole thing with Mathematica, but I did not solve the problem:
there are strange things happening at the origin.

2311237,Why does the combination formula divide counts by two?,"This thing is confusing me for a long time and hence  I am asking it here. We have a given set of numbers $$ X = \{1,2,3,4,5\} $$
and we want to form a $4$- digit number of the form $aaac$(this is just symbolic; I want all the arrangements of this form for e.g. $aaca$ etc). (I know that such questions' answers do exist on MSE, but my doubt/ confusion is pertinent to something extraneous to such questions.) To make such a number the first approach that we can induce in our solution is that of using simple combination technique and choose two numbers out of the set of $5$ numbers. This can be done in the following way: $$\binom{5}{2} \cdot \frac {4!}{3!}=40  $$ That seems fine as far as the combination formula is confirmed. 
Let us now take a naive approach and pretend as if we don't know the combination formula. Here we use the gap method:
Let us make one of our configuration as:
$$\fbox{a} \fbox{a} \fbox{a}  \fbox{c}$$
Here $a$ can be chosed in $5$ ways and $c$ can be chosen in $4$ ways
Total ways to make $aaac$ configuration $=5 \cdot 1\cdot 1\cdot 4 = 20$ ways Every such configuration now needs to be permuted since we want $aaca$ etc. also. To permute such a configuration, we can write:
$$ \frac {4!}{3!} \cdot 20 = 80$$ which is exactly double that of the answer obtained from the combination formula (which makes be believe that either I have double counted things or I have snubbed some of the arrangements). Now let us try to think about some cases manually: Case $1$: When $a=1$
The cases are: $$\{1112\}, \{1121\},\{1211\},\{2111\},\{1113\},\{1131\},\{1311\},\{3111\},\{1114\},\{1141\},\{1411\},\{4111\},\{1115\},\{1151\},\{1511\},\{5111\}$$
Thus there are $16$ configurations regarding $1$ only which means that for all the whole set, there are $16 \cdot 5 =80$ configurations. This proves that the problem is with my usage of the combination formula. Can anybody tell me how my usage of combination formula comes out to be fallacious?","['permutations', 'combinatorics']"
