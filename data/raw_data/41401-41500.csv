408905,Is there a name for this type of relation?,"Let $S$ be a set. Let $\sim$ be a binary relation on $S$. Suppose $\sim$ follows these three rules. $x\sim x$ for all $x\in S$ (reflexivity). If $x\sim y$, then $y\sim x$ for all $x, y \in S$ (symmetry). If $x_1\sim x_2 $, $x_2\sim x_3 $, $x_3\sim \cdots$, then there exists an $n>2$ in the indices of this chain of similarities such that $x_1\nsim x_n$. I'm trying to capture kind of ""partial"" or ""fuzzy"" transitivity. I'm not sure if these are quite the right rules and I'd be happy for anyone to refine them. It reminds me of that children's game, ""Whisper Down the Lane"", where children in a row whisper a message into each others' ears.

This is an exercise out of Herstein's Topics in Algebra .

Therefore I've tried several things with the quaternions, the $2\times 2$ matrices, the $3\times 3$ matrices, and even block matrices, all over $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$.

But I noticed that $p(10)=p(12)=57$ and $p(11)=51$ where $p$ is the partition function - this what the program gave me! Before that, I guessed that the partition function is increasing, but the calculations by the code showed that it's not.

408935,Can any torsion-free abelian group be embedded in a direct sum of copies of $\mathbb Q$?,"I'm trying to solve this for a problem and I need to know if what I have done is right: Let $B$ be a torsion-free abelian group. Then we consider the set $$A=\{(b,n):b\in B,n\in \mathbb Z,n\neq 0\}$$ and define $$(b,n)\sim (a,m) \text{ iff } bm=an.$$ This yields an equivalence relation, now you can define addition of classes by $(b,n)+(a,m)=(am+bn,nm)$ . Then $(A,+)$ is a torsion-free abelian group and $B$ can be embedded into $(A,+)$ , but also $(A,+)$ is divisible, so $(A,+)$ can be embedded in a direct sum of copies of $\mathbb Q$ .

408945,The rigorization of naive geometry angles and length,"There are a number of claims from elementary school that I just remembered I don't actually mathematically know.  Let's start with some specific examples and perhaps the rigorization will inspire me to know how to do it in any questions I remember in the future.  For example, it is said that ""the sum of the angles of a polygon in 2D with $k$ sides is $(k-2)\pi$.  I looked up the phrase ""interior angle"" and found this non-rigorous article . I am hoping that someone will either rigorously develop the requisite ideas, or if complicated, mention their names/resources where I could understand this.  Since I think it may be relevant, I have all the knowledge of a first year graduate course in differential/algebraic topology, and some differential geometry knowledge as well, but only passing. (To be more precise, I understand some basic Riemannian geometry like Riemmanian metrics, geodesics, and some basics about the curvature tensor, but not more.  Certainly not a first course equivalent in Riemannian geometry.) I was told by a peer that there are many ways of rigorizing angles when it becomes insufficient to define angle in $\mathbb{R}^k$ by $\cos^{-1}(\langle u, v\rangle /\|u\|\|v\|)$.  This is also what I've considered angle to mean in the context of manifolds, where one has lengths and angles via a Riemannian metric.  If someone could give some of the other definitions of angle (or length if any exists other than the notion of arclength for curves in a manifold, and the notion of minimal distance similarly, as well as the obvious algebraic notion of length for tangent space vectors) I would greatly appreciate it.","['geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

408954,A geometric reason why the square of the focal length of a hyperbola is equal to the sum of the squares of the axes?,"When I teach conics, I give a simple geometric argument for the Pythagorean relation for ellipses. (By ""Pythagorean relation"" I mean the fact that the square of the focal length $c$ is the difference of the squares of the semimajor and semiminor axes, i.e. $c^2=|a^2-b^2|$ for the ellipse defined by $\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$.) The picture argument goes as follows: just draw the obvious isosceles triangle from the two foci to one of the two points at the end of the minor axis. We see two right triangles; in each, one leg is the focal length $c$ and the other leg is the semiminor axis, while the hypotenuse is the semimajor axis. The result follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to this right triangle. But when it comes to the Pythagorean relation for hyperbolas, I can't think of an equally convincing picture to draw. Instead I have to give a rather inelegant algebraic argument for the relation $c^2=a^2+b^2$ (for the hyperbola defined by $\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$, with focal length $c$), directly from the definition of the hyperbola. The messy details are below.* Now, obviously there is an asymmetry between the argument for the ellipse and the argument for the hyperbola: the ellipse argument is almost trivial and doesn't involve working straight from the locus definition, but the hyperbola argument is tedious and does require working straight from the definition. So, my question: Is there an equally persuasive picture I could draw to convince high
  school students of the Pythagorean relation for hyperbolas -- without having to get technical with points at infinity, say? The natural triangle to draw is the right triangle with legs from the center to a vertex and from that vertex to an asymptote, which has legs of length $a$ and $b$; but then the problem becomes why the length along the asymptote should be equal to $c$. I doubt there is a purely (Euclidean) geometrical reason because this triangle lies on the asymptote, not on the hyperbola itself; I suspect some sort of limiting procedure will be required. [*] The tedious algebraic details: The foci lie at $(\pm c,0)$.
  Say $a>b$. Then hyperbola is the locus of points $(x,y)$ such that $$\left|\sqrt{(x+c)^2+y^2}-\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2}\right|=2a$$ Assume for simplicity the expression between the absolute value bars
  is positive. (The algebra is even more tedious if we don't make such a
  simplifying assumption.) Then moving the right root to the other side
  and squaring gives $$(x+c)^2+y^2=4a^2+(x-c)^2+y^2+4a\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2}$$ Simplifying gives $$xc-a^2=a\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2}$$ and upon squaring again we have $$x^2c^2-2xca^2+a^4=a^2(x^2-2xc+c^2+y^2)=a^2x^2-2xca^2+c^2a^2+a^2y^2$$ which reduces to $$x^2(c^2-a^2)-y^2a^2=a^2(c^2-a^2)$$ Defining $b^2:=c^2-a^2$ brings the equation into the form
  $x^2/a^2+y^2/b^2=1$, and the Pythagorean relation follows from the
  definition of $b$.","['geometry', 'conic-sections']"

Then $f^{-1}$ is continuous at $f(x)$. Any hints are welcome. If this is false, I would like to have a counterexample. I tried the $\epsilon,\delta$ argument and I know this statement may not be true. But this problem only tells the continuity at a single point, and the function may not be monotone, for example: $$f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R},\quad f(x)=\begin{cases}x,&x\in\mathbb{Q}\\

(Or, if you like the composition sign, $f'\circ f=f\circ f'$). I could only come up with trivial examples of such functions: $f(x)=0$ and $f(x)=e^{x}$. This reminds me of a recent Putnam problem (2010), which asked whether or not there exists a strictly increasing function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f'(x)=f(f(x))$. (The answer is: No).

409000,Is there a simple group of any (infinite) size?,"I'm trying to show that for any infinite cardinal $\kappa$ there is a simple group $G$ of size $\kappa$, I tried to use the compactness theorem and then ascending Löwenheim-Skolem, but this is impossible as the following argument shows: Suppose $F$ is a set of sentences in a first-order language containing the language of groups such that for any group $G$ we have $G\vDash F$ iff $G$ is a simple group, let $\varphi$ be a sentence such that $G\vDash \varphi $ iff $G$ is abelian. Then as for each prime $p$, $\mathbb Z_p$ is simple and abelian, by the compactness theorem there is an infinite abelian simple group $G$, and thus using Löwenheim-Skolem we obtain an uncountable simple abelian group $G$. Pick a non-zero element $a\in G$, then $\langle a \rangle$ is a proper normal subgroup of $G$. Contradiction. Note that the contradiction is not obtained by the existence of an infinite abelian simple group, something which I don't whether it's true or not, but by the assumption of the axiomatization of the simple groups, and the use of Lowënheim-Skolem theorem.

$$\frac 1{\sqrt n + \sqrt{n-1}} \le \frac{1}{100},$$ or $\sqrt n+ \sqrt{n-1} \ge 100$. Now I squared both sides:
$$2n-1+2 \sqrt n \sqrt{n-1}\ge 100.$$ 
So $$\sqrt n (\sqrt n +\sqrt{n-1})\ge \frac {101}2.$$ However, we know that $\sqrt n+\sqrt{n-1}\ge 100$, so I substituted that:
$$\sqrt n (100) \ge \frac {101}{2}.$$

409057,Confused about the group of permutations $S_{n}$,"In an exercise, I must prove $S_{n}$ is generated by 2 elements. I'll ignore here the trivial case $n = 1$. Let $I_{n} = \{1, 2, 3, ..., n\}$. I then defined $f : I_{n} \rightarrow I_{n}$ by $f(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 1$, and $f(i) = i,$ for $i \neq 1, 2$. Also $g : I_{n} \rightarrow I_{n}$ by $g(1) = n$ and $g(i + 1) = i$ for $i \in \{1, ..., n - 1\}$. I claimed $f, g$ generate $S_{n}$, which is apparently correct. But my explanation is apparently completely wrong. I hope someone may undo my confusion. So intuitively, $f$ is a swap permutation which swaps the first two elements, and $g$ is a shift permutation which shifts everything to the left. We note any permutation can be written as a series of ""swaps"" (transpositions). So it suffices to show $f, g$ generate the swaps. So suppose I want to compose $f$ and $g$ in such a way to swap $1 \leq i < j \leq n$. The algorithm would go somewhat like this: shift everything to the left until $i$ is the first element. Now apply swap once, then shift back again, apply swap, shift back, and so forth until you just swapped $i$ with $j$. Count how many times you shifted left after you first swapped. Now you shift right (which is just the inverse of shifting left), swap, shift right, swap, .. and do that just as many times as you shifted left. In the end you should be left with exactly $i, j$ swapped and everything else in its place. Let's do an example. Suppose I want to swap 1 and 4 in 1234. It'll go as: 2134 (swapped) 1342 (shifted left 1 time) 3142 (swapped) 1423 (shifted left 2 times) 4123 (swapped 4 and 1; I'll start shifting right now) 3412 (shifted right 1 time) 4312 (swapped) 2431 (shifted right 2 times) 4231 (swapped) And we are done! Apparently the problem with this is that $f$ doesn't actually swap the first and second elements, there is no order, it just swaps 1 with 2. Under which interpretation this makes little sense. My question is: is my way of thinking about this completely wrong? Is it merely coincidental that I achieved a correct answer? And if it is wrong, how should I be thinking about permutations? I am not familiar with the cycle notation.","['permutations', 'symmetric-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

I am hoping to see the same result for the n dimensional sphere. I am using the following expression which can be found in Schutz. $$R_{\alpha \beta \mu \nu}=\frac{1}{2}(g_{\alpha \nu, \beta \mu}-g_{\alpha \mu, \beta \nu }+ g_{\beta \mu, \alpha \nu}-g_{\beta \nu, \alpha \mu})$$ Here $g_{\alpha \nu, \beta \mu}$ means $\frac{\partial g_{\alpha \nu}}{\partial \beta \mu}$.

The Ricci tensor is $R_{ij}=R^l_{ilj}=g^{lm}R_{milj}$, as the metric tensor is diagonal $m=l, and setting first and third index equal in the expression for the RIemann curvature which would cause the first and third term to be zero as the derivatives are zero by the above argument, I get $$R_{ij}=-\frac{1}{2}g^{il}(g_{ll,ij}+g_{ij,ll})=-\frac{1}{2}g^{ll}g_{ll,ij}$$ I was predicting, that from the 2 sphere case to get a term proportional the the metric tensor.

409106,Closest point in $y = \sqrt{x}$ to the origin is at $x=-1/2$?,"When I solve for the point in $y = \sqrt{x}$ closest to the origin using calculus, I get $x = -1/2$. And this is the case for ALL functions $y = \sqrt{x + c}$ using the distance formula $d^2 = x^2 + y^2$. Why is it that the extreme point is somewhere the function is not even defined? Obviously (at least to me), isn't the closest point to the origin (0, 0)? EDIT: Solution: We want the nearest distance from the origin to some point P in the function $y = \sqrt{x}$. We can use $d^2 = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2$ as the optimization function with the constraint that the other point (say, (x2, y2)) be on the curve $y = \sqrt{x}$. We set the other point, say (x1, y1), to the origin and be (0, 0). When you put them all together, you get $d^2 = (x - 0)^2 + (\sqrt{x} - 0)^2 = x^2 + x$. You get the derivative of that and set it to zero to optimize. $d(d^2)/dx = 2x + 1 = 0$ and so $x = -1/2$. My question is why is this the case? Is there a way to end up with x = 0 using calculus?

And one more question:
Every Taylor series converges (pointiwise) for every $x$ so has radius of convergence $\infty$ right? These questions came up when I was studying and saw I my notes that the lecture interchange the summation and the integration of the Taylor series, for example $\displaystyle{ \frac{1}{ 1+ x^2} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n x^{2n}, |x|<1 \implies \arctan x = \int_{0}^{x} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n t^{2n} dt=  \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n \int_{0}^{x} t^{2n} dt }$ and I can understand how can we do this if the convergence in not uniform, which in this example is not since $\displaystyle{ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = \frac{1}{1-x} }$ pointwise but not uniform.",['real-analysis']

I understand that for hyperboloid model of hyperbolic $3$-space sitting inside $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ for example, we take each point $p$ in $\mathbb{H}^3$, draw the unique line through $p$ and $0$, denote by $f(p)$ the point where it intersects the plane $\{x_4=1\}$. So $f(x)=\frac{x}{x_4}$. Thus $f$ defines a projection from $\mathbb{H}^3$ to  $\{x_4=1\}$. But there is also another projective model of $\mathbb{H}^3$: where you just consider the map : $g:\mathbb{H}^3 \to \mathbb{RP}^3$ defined by: $g(p)=[p]\in \mathbb{RP}^3$. The thing which is not clear to me is why these two models are equivalent? I understand that in the case of $f$, $f(\mathbb{H}^3)$ lies in a single chart of $\mathbb{RP}^3$, so is it true $g(\mathbb{H}^3)$ lies in single chart in $\mathbb{RP}^3$? Are these two projective models equivalent? How exactly do we define projective models for the anti-de-Sitter spaces?  We can define projections from $AdS_3=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^{4,2}:x_1^2+x_2^2-x_3^2-x_4^2=-1\}$ to $\mathbb{RP}^3$ by $g_1(p)=[p]\in \mathbb{RP}^3$. $g_1$ is similar to $g$, but is there a $f_1$ similar to $f$, where it projects to a certain plane?

I would also appreciate information on any conditions on a space which imply that any accumulation point of $A$ is the limit of some sequence in $A$. For example, if $X$ is first countable (e.g. any metric space) then it is easy to show that any accumulation point of $A$ must be the limit of some sequence of points in $A$.

409418,Can a free group over a set be constructed this way (without equivalence classes of words)?,"Denote category of monoids equipped with involution by $\textbf{invMon}$.
Objects are pairs $\left(M,\iota\right)$ where $\iota$ is a map
on the underlying set of $M$. Denoting $\iota$ by $x\mapsto\bar{x}$
we have $\bar{\bar{x}}=x$ and $\overline{x.y}=\bar{y}.\bar{x}$.
Arrows in $\textbf{invMon}$ are homomorphisms that respect
the involution. There is a forgetful functor $U:\textbf{invMon}\rightarrow\textbf{Set}$
and it has a left adjoint $F$. Every group equipped with the map
$x\mapsto x^{-1}$ can be recognized as object of $\textbf{invMon}$
and every group homomorphism respects this involution. This gives a
functor $I:\textbf{Grp}\rightarrow\textbf{invMon}$
and if $L$ is a left adjoint for $I$ then composite functor $LF:\textbf{Set}\rightarrow\textbf{Grp}$
should sends each set to a group free over the set. For object $\left(M,\iota\right)$
define $S=\left\{ x.\bar{x}\mid x\in M\right\} $ and $R=\left\{ 1\right\} \times S$.
Let $C$ be the smallest congruence containing $R$ and let $M/C$
denote the 'quotient-monoid'. Then $\left[\bar{x}\right]\left[x\right]=\left[x\right]\left[\bar{x}\right]=\left[1\right]$
showing that $M/C$ is a group with $\left[\bar{x}\right]=\left[x\right]^{-1}$.
So natural map $\nu:M\rightarrow M/C$ respects involution, hence
is an arrow $\nu:\left(M,\iota\right)\rightarrow\left(M/C,inv\right)$
in $\textbf{invMon}$. Also $\left(M/C,\nu\right)$ is universal
in the sence that for every arrow $\psi:\left(M,\iota\right)\rightarrow I\left(G\right)$
in $\textbf{invMon}$ there is a unique group homomorphism $\phi:M/C\rightarrow G$
with $\psi=I\varphi\circ\nu$. This means that $I$ indeed has a left
adjoint. Then here we have the construction of a free group over a
set that does not mention any equivalence classes of words or any
reduced words. I am very suspicious, however. This because I never

A reduction: If $R$ is a unital, associative ring, then define $B(R)$ to be set of all central idempotents of $R$, $B(R) = \{ e \in R: e^2 = e, er=re ~(\forall r \in R) \}$. $B(R)$ is a ring under the operations $e \oplus f = e+f -ef$ and the standard multiplication from $R$. If $R$ was a direct product of directly indecomposable rings $R_i =  Re_i$ for $i \in I$, then the elements of $B(R)$ are exactly the $e_J$ for $J \subseteq I$; $e_J \oplus e_K = e_{J \oplus K}$ where $J \oplus K$ is symmetric-difference; and $e_J \cdot e_K = e_{J \cap K}$. In particular, $B(R) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}^I$ is what is called a complete boolean algebra. Hence any ring in which $B(R)$ is not a complete boolean algebra is an example. If $B(B(R)) = B(R)$, then I think this will basically work, though I still wouldn't mind the details being stated clearly (especially in algebraic language). Anderson–Fuller page 102 provides an example to those who understand the topology of $\mathbb{Q}$, but I'm not such a person. I think the finite-cofinite boolean algebra is likely more my speed, but I'm not sure it is not isomorphic to a complete boolean algebra.

409700,Proof of weak maximum principle.,"I read a proof in my book on pde which I find a bit strange. Let $\Omega$ be some bounded domain. For $f\in\mathscr C^2(\Omega)\cap\mathscr C^0(\Omega)$ satisfying $\Delta f\geq0$ it holds that $\max_\bar\Omega(f)=\max_{\partial\Omega}(f)$. The proof follows by showing that it holds for $f$ with $\Delta f>0$ based on the second derivative test, and then generalizes it by considering the function $v(x)=f(x)+\epsilon|x|^2$ for $\epsilon$>0. Now since the norm function is strictly subharmonic, we have $\Delta v>0$. The author proceeds as follows:
$$\max_{\bar\Omega} (v)=\max_{\partial\Omega}(v) \Longrightarrow \max_\bar\Omega (f)+\epsilon\min_\bar\Omega(|x|^2)\leq \max_{\partial\Omega}(f)+\epsilon\max_{\partial\Omega}(|x|^2) \Longrightarrow \max_\bar\Omega(f)=\max_{\partial\Omega}(f)$$ since epsilon was arbitrary. My question is, why would it not work to simply let epsilon be 1 in the beginning and reason as follows. $$\max_\bar\Omega(f)+\max_\bar\Omega(|x|^2)=\max_{\bar\Omega} (v)=\max_{\partial\Omega}(v)=\max_{\partial\Omega}(f)+\max_{\partial\Omega}(|x|^2)$$ which implies the result since $\max_{\bar\Omega}(|x|^2)=\max_{\partial\Omega}(|x|^2)$ since $|x|$ is strictly subharmonic.

This argument does not extend to nets, so I believe the claim has to be wrong, but I don't see how to make a counterexample. (Updated) If $A$ is locally compact, the answer seems to be positive as well: since every $a \in A$ has a compact neighborhood $K$ , every $(a,b) \in A \times B$ belongs to the interior of $K \times B$ for some compact $K$ and since $f$ by assumption is continuous on this set and consequently on a neighborhood of $(a,b)$ , the function has to be continuous at $(a,b)$ .","['general-topology', 'continuity', 'compactness']"

If $P$ is a prime ideal of $S$ , show that the preimage $f^{-1}(P)$ is a prime ideal of $R$ . Define $g: S \rightarrow S/P$ with kernel $s$ . Let $h = g \circ f: R \rightarrow S/P$ . Since $h$ is a ring homomorphism, the kernel is an ideal of $R$ . Also, from the first isomorphism theorem, we know that $R/\ker(h) \cong S/P$ . Since $P$ is a prime ideal of $S$ , we know that $S/P$ is an integral domain. Since $R/\ker(h)$ is isomorphic to $S/P$ , it must also be an integral domain, which implies that the kernel of $h$ (which is the preimage of $P$ ) is a prime ideal of $R$ . Do you think my answer is correct? The reason why I was a bit skeptical of my answer is because I did not use the fact that $R$ and $S$ are commutative.

I know of two ways to do this, by substitution in the series summation or by differentiating the original four times. When substituting I am left with cosines in my result which is not sufficient, but differentiating this formula will take a $very$ long time. Is there a pattern in differentiating this function that im missing or is there a way to get rid of the $cos$ when substituting? I did eventually go for differentiating everything and took me forever, much longer than I think was intended for this assignment, that is why I think I am missing the point. The derivatives to the fourth degree fill an entire page in my noteblock so I wont type it over here but my result was $$1+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{12}+HOT$$ I have yet to find out if I was correct, but nevertheless I think I should learn an insight here about how to get this answer an easier way.

First of all, in what follows I'm not allowed (unfortunately) to use the structure theorem for abelian groups. I'm asked to prove the following: Let $G$ be an abelian group with $\vert G\vert =mn$ and $\gcd(m,n)=1$. Prove that $G$ is $H\times K$ with $H,K\leq G$, $\vert H\vert =m$ and $\vert K\vert =n$. There's a hint: consider $G^{m}:=\{g^{m}\in G:\ g\in G\}$ and $G^n$ analogously defined. Well, $G^m$ and $G^n$ are subgroups of $G$ because they are the images under the maps $g\mapsto g^m$ and $g\mapsto g^n$ from $G$ to $G$ and such functions are homomorphisms because $G$ is abelian. By the fact that $$o(g^m)=\dfrac{o(g)}{\gcd (o(g),m)}$$ (where $o(g)$ denotes the order of $g$) and using $\gcd(m,n)=1$, I easily get that $G^m\cap G^n$ is trivial. It is also easy to show that $G^m G^n=G$, writing $1=um+vn$ for some $u,v\in\mathbb{Z}$. Since $G$ is abelian, both subgroups are normal and I get $G^m \times G^n\cong G$. The question is: ""How do I show that $\{\vert G^m\vert,\ \vert G^n\vert\}=\{m,n\}$?""
I tried to look at the kernel of, say, $g\mapsto g^m$ which is the set of all elements of $G$ whose order divides $m$ and noticed that $G^{n}\subseteq \ker (g\mapsto g^m)$ but I can't go any further.

I would appreciate any help in solving this problem. Some background information for convenience: We recall that for two projective plane curves of degree with no common component, we have defined $F\bullet G$ to be the formal sum $$F\bullet G = \sum_{P\in \mathbb{P}^2} I(P,F\cap G) P.
$$ where $I(P, F\cap G)$ is the intersection number of $F$ and $G$ at $P.$ The intersection number is $1$ if and only if $F$ and $G$ meet at $P$ transversally , which means that $P$ is a simple point on both $F$ and $G,$ and the tangent to $F$ at $P$ is distinct to the tangent to $G$ at $P.$ The first condition in our problem means that $L$ intersects $C$ transversally at $3$ distinct points $P_i.$ The simplest version of this problem is when $P_i\neq Q_i, i=1,2,3$ (i.e when each tangent $L_i$ meets $C$ again at another points $\neq P_i$) It then says: Show that the three points when the tangents again intersect $C$ lie on a line.

As I'm not sure about its ""ways"", I'm not editing it much and as such it might be in the wrong order. My sincere apologies.
If you got any idea where to find that proof in the literature, I'd be very thankful! The proof works only on certain sets, equipped with the following properties: Definition ""Set of integration"" Let $G\subset \mathbb R^n$ be an open, bounded set and his boundary $\partial G:= \partial_r G \cup G_0$ so that the following holds true: $\partial G$ is a $(n-1)$-dimensional submanifold of  $\mathbb R^n$ dim$ G_0 < n-1$, (hausdoff-dimension or lower dimensional manifold) vol$(\partial_r G < \infty)$ For every $x \in \partial_r G$ exists an open subset $U \subset \mathbb R^n$, so that $x \in U$ and a diffeomorphism $\phi:U\to B^n\subset \mathbb R^n$, so that $\phi(U\cap G)=\{x \in B^n|x_1 > 0\}$. Stokes Theorem Let $G\subset \mathbb R^n$ be a set of integration. Let $U \supset \overline{G}$ be an open subset and $w \in \Lambda^{n-1} (U)$ a differential form. Then the following holds 
true: $\int_G d\omega = \int _{\partial_r G} \omega $ Proof $\underline{n=1}$: $G$ is a union of finitely many intervalls. Question one :Do i get the finitely many intervalls because of the following argument? As $\partial_r G$ is of dimension zero according to 2., it's charts carry the discrete topology and therefore the charts domains are only single points. And with 3. and the counting measure the finity follows. Without the loss of substance we can limit ourself to one open intervall. Question two :With the exactness of the cohomolgy group on the intervall and and the fundamental theorem of integration follows: $\int_a^b f'(x) dx = f(b)-f(a)$ $\underline{1\to n}$: Let $H:=\{x \in R^n | x_1 = 0\}$, $pr_H : R^N \to H$ the orthgonal projection and $p:= pr_H|_\overline{G}$. Then $p(\overline{G})=p(\partial G)$: Question three :About: $p(\overline{G})=p(\partial G)$ $p(x)$ is closed, $p$ is continuous and $G$ is bounded therefore $p^{-1} (x)$ is compact.
  With compactness we get the existence of a finite cover of $p^{-1}(x)$, so we get finitely many intervals.But how does that help me, if it's true? So that now we can write:(Fubini) $\int_G d\omega = \int _{p(G)} \int_{p^{-1}(x)} d\omega $ Here i will omit the proof and only name his next two claims. The author proves that: $p(G) \backslash p(\partial_r G)$ and $p(\partial_r G) \backslash p(G)$ are both null sets. And concludes with following lemma the proof of stokes theorem: Lemma Let $X,Y$ be oriented manifolds, dimension of $X$ and $Y$ should be $n$. And $\varphi:Y\to X$ a $C^1$ function, $\Omega \in \Lambda^n(X)$ and $f: Y \to \mathbb R$ be $\varphi ^* \Omega $ integratable. Then the following holds true: $\int_Y f\varphi^* \Omega = \int_X (\sum_y\in \varphi^{-1} f(y))\Omega$ where $\epsilon(y)$:= sign of the determinant of $d\varphi_y$ We can simplify the differential form $\omega$ to $\omega = f dx_2 \wedge ... \wedge dx_n$ and  $d\omega = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} dx_1^...dx_n:=\omega_1 \wedge \Omega, \omega_1 \in \Lambda^1(U) $. For $\Omega = dx_2 \wedge ... \wedge dx_n$ there is $p^* \Omega = dx_2 \wedge...\wedge dx_n$ and we can write: $\int_{\partial_r G} \omega$ $= \int_{\partial_r G}p^*\Omega $ = $\int_{\partial_r G} f\Omega $= $\int_{p(\partial_r G)} (\sum_{y \in (p|_{\partial _r G})^{-1} (x) } \epsilon(y) f(y))\Omega$ And we have already shown that: $(p|_{\partial_r G})^{-1}= \{a_1,b1\} \cup ...\cup \{a_m,b_m\}$ And $\epsilon(a_j)=-1$,$\epsilon(b_j)=1$, so that:  $\sum_{y \in p^{-1}(x)}\epsilon(y)f(y)=\sum_{j=1,..,n} f(b_j)-f(a_j)=\int_p^{-1}(x) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}dx_1$. Now we conclude that: $ \int_G d\omega $= $ \int_{p(\partial_r G)}(\int_{p|_G)^{-1}(x)} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}\omega $ =$ \int_{p(\partial_r G)} (\sum_{y \in (p|_{\partial _r G})^{-1} (x) } \epsilon(y) f(y))\Omega = \int_{\partial_r G} \omega$ Question four: We now know that $p(G) \backslash p(\partial_r G)$ and $p(\partial_r G) \backslash p(G)$ are both null sets. I suppose we're using the Lebesgue measure to quantify a nullset.
When doing the actual integration in the stokes theorem, we use the integral of a differential form, not the Lebesgue measure. Or am i wrong, in that we use the Lebesgue measure to define the integral of a differential form? And we do need to know that $G_0$ is a nullset for both sides $\omega$ and $d\omega$ because we use a Lebesgue measure of degree $n$ and one of degree $n-1$ ? I hope $p(G) \backslash p(\partial_r G)$ is a nullset for the measure of degree $n$ and $p(\partial_r G) \backslash p(G)$  for $n-1$. Question five: One more thing about the sort of interval $p^{-1}(x)$.
He's basically using the fact that $p^{-1}(x) \in \mathbb R x \mathbb R^{n-1} \cong \mathbb R$, that means for orthogonal projections the intervall in $\mathbb R^n$ is canonically isomorph to $\mathbb R$.  So if we integrate now, we measure $p^{-1}(x)$ with the Lebesgue measure in $\mathbb R$? I guess that's some sort of fubini?
