78725,Special Cases of Quadratic Reciprocity and Counting Fixed Points,"The general theorem is: for all odd, distinct primes $p, q$, the following holds:
$$\left( \frac{p}{q} \right)  \left( \frac{q}{p} \right) = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}\frac{q-1}{2}}$$ I've discovered the following proof for the case $q=3$:
Consider the Möbius transformation $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}$, defined on $F_{p} \cup {\infty}$. It is a bijection of order 3: $f^{(3)} = Id$. Now we'll count the number of fixed points of $f$, modulo 3: 1) We can calculate the number of solutions to $f(x) = x$: it is equivalent to $(2x-1)^2 = -3$. Since $p \neq 2,3$, the number of solutions is $\left( \frac{-3}{p} \right) + 1$ (if $-3$ is a non-square, there's no solution. Else, there are 2 distinct solutions, corresponding to 2 distinct roots of $-3$). 2) We know the structure of $f$ as a permutation: only 3-cycles or fixed points. Thus, number of fixed points is just $|F_{p} \cup {\infty}| \mod 3$, or: $p+1 \mod 3$. Combining the 2 results yields $p = \left( \frac{-3}{p} \right) \mod 3$. Exploiting Euler's criterion gives $\left( \frac{p}{3} \right) = p^{\frac{3-1}{2}} = p \mod 3$, and using $\left( \frac{-1}{p} \right) = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}}$, we get:
$$\left( \frac{3}{p} \right)  \left( \frac{p}{3} \right) = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}\frac{3-1}{2}} \mod 3$$
and equality in $\mathbb{Z}$ follows. My questions: Can this idea be generalized, with other functions $f$? Is there a list\article of proofs to special cases of the theorem?","['quadratic-reciprocity', 'number-theory']"
78737,Weak*-topology and probability measures,"Let $Y$ denote a separable metric space, and $\mathcal{P}(Y)$ the set of probability (understood as countably additive) measures on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of $Y$. The weak*-topology says that a sequence $\mu_{n}$ (or more generally a net) in $\mathcal{P}(Y)$ converges to $\mu$ when $\int fd\mu_{n}$ converges to $\int fd\mu$ for each bounded continuous mapping $f:Y \to \mathbb{R}$. My question is: It is known that the set $\mathcal{P}(Y)$ is not necessarily closed when endowed with such a topology (see one example here where the limit is not countably additive). Is it possible to say more generally that whenever $Y$ is not finite (or perhaps ""richer"" in some sense) there exists a sequence in $\mathcal{P}(Y)$ weakly* converging to zero?

78785,Software to find the equilibria of a set of differential equations?,"Context for this question: I'm in mathematical biology, and while I've got a decent grasp of the concepts, and am a decent hand with simulation and numerical approaches, my analytical abilities and general skill at manipulating equations has always been rough. Probably the root of deciding I was ""bad at math"" back in the day, though that's neither here nor there. What I'm trying to do is find the equilibriums for a set of differential equations, similar to the following: $$\begin{align}
\frac{{dS}}{{dt\strut}} =& \mu  - (\beta I + \mu )S\\
\frac{{dE}}{{dt\strut}} =& \beta SI - (\mu  + \sigma )E\\

\frac{{dR}}{{dt\strut}} =& \gamma I - \mu R

78808,Can I build a finitely additive function on $\mathbb{Q}_p$?,"This is partially motivated by a question I saw earlier here, Does such a finitely additive function exist? I've been reading about the topology of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ in Knapp's Advanced Algebra in Chapter 6, and I'm wondering if it's possible to impose a finitely additive function on $\mathbb{Q}_p$ in a natural way. By this I mean, suppose I take closed balls of form
$$
B(x,r)=\{y\in\mathbb{Q}_p\mid|x-y|\leq p^{-r}\}
$$
and let $\mathscr{B}$ be the set ring consisting of finite unions of such balls. I suspect there must also be a finitely additive function $\mu\colon\mathscr{B}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}$, the nonnegative reals, such that $\mu(B(x,r))=p^{-r}$, as one would expect naturally? In the case for $\mathbb{Q}$, such a function was constructed by first constructing a function which mapped a member of the set ring to its intersection with $\mathbb{Q}$. However, I view elements of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as sequences in $\prod_{j=1}^\infty\mathbb{Q}$, so would their be some similar way of constructing such a function by first considering finite unions of such closed balls of sequences in $\prod_{j=1}^\infty\mathbb{R}$? And unlike the case in $\mathbb{Q}$, would it in fact be possible to extend $\mu$ to a unique measure on the generated $\sigma$-algebra of $\mathscr{B}$? Edit : Harry Altman's answer shows that the Haar measure is a measure which restricts back to this property. I guess I'm curious on how this would be built up. I mean, what would be the basic finitely additive function on $\mathscr{B}$ that could be uniquely extended to the Haar measure on the generated $\sigma$-algebra?

78873,Precise definition of the boundary set,"I am confused about definition of the boundary set.
Definition: Given set $A$ and its complement $A^c$; Point $x$ belongs to the boundary of $A$ if every open ball centred at $x$ contains points of $A$ and $A^c$. Now to my confusion:
Taking as an example set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ and its complement in $\mathbb{R}^1$. Set $A$ does not contain any limit points. Then for $\forall x\in A$ the only member of $A$ that is contained in all the balls centered at $x$, is $x$ itself. Now, $x\notin A^c$ but is a limit point in $A^c$, hence every ball centered at $x$ contains elements of $A^c$. Can I conclude that $x$ is in the boundary set of $A$, even though it is an isolated point in $A$?

78902,Asymptotics of terms and errors in Stirling's Approximation,"I have two related questions. Both are related to the asymptotics of Stirling's approximation, which is why I have included them in the same question. I will separate the questions if it is deemed necessary. Consider Stirling's approximation.
$$n! = \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n \left( 1 + O \left(\frac{1}{n} \right)\right)$$
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n!}{\sqrt{2 \pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n} = 1$$
The exact terms of the expression are more precisely described by Stirling's series . Unfortunately the series is not convergent so at some point, for each particular $n$ there is a term $a_{f(n)}$ of the expansion at which point summing terms increases the magnitude of relative error. $f : \mathbb{N}^+ \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and for $n$ in the domain, $f(n)$ is defined as rank at which the magnitude of the terms in the asymptotic expansion of the ratio $\frac{n!}{\sqrt{2 \pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n \left(1+ \frac{1}{12n} + \cdots\right)}$ begins to increase. My first question is what is known about $f(n)$? I believe it is known that $f(n)$ is monotonically increasing. Do we know the asymptotic growth of $f(n)$? If so, is there a known simple closed form expression for $f(n)$? My second question has to do with error rates of Stirling's approximation and it depends on the first question having been resolved. Of course it is known that in the limit the relative error of approximating the factorial of $n$ approaches $0$. However, if one were to be interested in precisely how quickly the series well approximates the function, simple convergence in the limit is not enough. I would like to know the rate of convergence for the sequence $g(n) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{f(n)} {a_i}$ in approximating $n!$.

My expected damage taken per round is 7/3. I have the first attack. What are my chances of winning? edit : As pointed out, the question is unanswerable without further info on distributions, so here it is: A round consists of multiple attacks. If I hit, I can attack again. My damage per hit is 5/6 1, and I have a 5/6 probability of hitting. I figured this makes a geometric series with $a = 5/6, r = 5/6$, so using $a / (1 - r)$ we get an expected damage of 5. Edit: Typo above. Damage is 1 point if I hit, so expected damage is 5/6. (Geometric series is still correct.) When defending, similar rules apply. My damage taken is 7/6, and probability of being hit is 1/2. So a geometric series gives expected damage taken as 7/3.

78993,Contour Integration and Branch Cuts: $\oint_{|\omega|=x}d\omega\:(1-\omega)^{-3/4}(x-\omega)^{-3/4}\omega^{-3/4}$,"I have a embarrassingly simple question. For some reason I haven't really studied complex before and I'm suffering under this now. I need to evaluate contour integrals of multi-valued functions and I'm confused about a few details (the standard examples in the textbooks avoid the difficulties I encounter with my integrals). Let me take some examples from the paper arXiv:1008.5194 (see pages 53-54). There they want to evaluate the integral
$$\oint_{|\omega|=x}d\omega\:(1-\omega)^{-3/4}(x-\omega)^{-3/4}\omega^{-3/4}$$ where $x\in]0,1[$ and they get
$$(-1+e^{-i\frac{3\pi}2})\int_0^xd\omega\:(1-\omega)^{-3/4}(x-\omega)^{-3/4}\omega^{-3/4}.$$
(Which is essentially the integral representation of hypergeometric functions). Since the integrand is multi-valued and has branch points at $\omega = 0, x, 1$ we should probably make a branch cut on the positive real axis. If I naively deform the contour into a line from $x$ to $0$ above the real axis and a line from $0$ to $x$ below the real axis, I seem to get the right result. But that can't be correct; due to the branch cut the circle is not closed and we need to cross the cut several times to get back to the original Riemann sheet and close the contour. But when I do this, taking into account the phases accumulated while going around the Riemann surface, I don't get the correct result. How is this done right? Another example is 
$$\oint_{|\omega|=1}d\omega\:(1-\omega)^{-3/4}(x-\omega)^{-3/4}\omega^{-3/4} = (1-e^{-i\frac{3\pi}2})\int_1^{\infty}d\omega\:(1-\omega)^{-3/4}(x-\omega)^{-3/4}\omega^{-3/4}.$$

All of the proofs start by taking any differentiable curve, parametrized in $t$, residing in the level set and passing through the point of interest $\vec{a}$. The chain rule guarantees that the tangent to the curve is orthogonal to the gradient at $\vec{a}$. Since this happens for any curve, we can say that the gradient is orthogonal to the surface. I'm thinking that the IFT is needed to prove that such a curve actually exists, but I'm not sure on how exactly it does that. If anyone can shed some light on the subject that would be great.

79129,Central Limit Theorem and sum of squared random variables,"This is a two-part question. Suppose I am drawing random variables $X_i\sim A$, $1\leq i \leq n$ where $A$ is a zero-mean, finite variance $\sigma_A^2$, symmetric probability distribution having finite fourth moment $\mathbb{E}(X^4)$ over the support of real number line.  Assume that for all $(i,j)$, $X_i$ and $X_j$ are independent.  I am interested in approximating the distribution of the sum of squares $\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^2$ with the normal distribution, for very large $n$.  In the second part of the question I relax the assumption that $X_i$'s are identically-distributed, but keep same conditions on each $A_i$. By Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the sum of these i.i.d. random variables, the random variable 
$$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{\sqrt{n\sigma_A^2}}\xrightarrow{D}\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$ where $\xrightarrow{D}$ denotes convergence in distribution. Thus, I can approximate the distribution of the sum by $\mathcal{N}(0,n\sigma_A^2)$ for large enough $n$. The first part of my question is: what distribution can I use to approximate the sum of the squares of a large number of these i.i.d. random variables $\sum_{i=1}^n X^2_i$?  Do a function of it converge to a standard Gaussian in distribution (i.e. given large enough, possibly infinite $n$)?  I understand that if $A$ is a Gaussian, then $\frac{1}{\sigma_A^2}\sum_{i=1}^n X^2_i\sim\chi^2(n)$, which can be approximated by $\mathcal{N}(n\sigma_A^2,2n\sigma_A^4)$ for very large $n$ using the asymptotic properties of chi-squared distribution (where $\sigma_A^4$ denotes squared variance.)  But what happens when $A$ has the nice properties described above, but is not necessarily Gaussian? My intuition tells me that that it should converge to a Gaussian, since we are still dealing with a sum of random variables with finite mean and variance.  But I'm not sure how to prove that or characterize the distribution in terms of $n$ and $\sigma_A^2$. Second part of the question is a further generalization on this topic.  Now suppose $X_i\sim A_i$ are non-identically distributed.  They are all still independent, and $A_i$ are still zero-mean and symmetric, but they all have different finite variances $\sigma_i^2$, and may have a different form.  Since the means and variances are finite, Lindeberg's condition is met, which assures us that CLT holds for the $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n\sigma_i^2}}\xrightarrow{D}\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.  However, again, I am wondering what happens with the sum of squares $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2$.  Is there a function of it that converges to a nice random variable such as Gaussian in distribution (i.e. for an appropriately large $n$, possibly infinite, does it look Gaussian) If so, to what distribution does it converge to and how can one characterize both the distribution and the function of $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ in terms of $n$ and $\sigma_i^2$, and possibly $\mathbb{E}(X_i^4)$?  Is the result more attainable if each $A_i$ is a zero-mean Gaussian with variance $\sigma_i^2$? Again, my intuition tells me that a function of $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2$ should converge to a Gaussian, since again we are dealing with the sum of random variables with finite means and variances, which should meet Lindeberg's condition...  but is there a proof and how to characterization of this distribution in terms of $n$ and $\sigma_i^2$?

If $X$ is a Banach space, then at most finitely many of them can be continuous. I have learned the following argument from comments in this question . Suppose that $\{b_i; i\in\mathbb N\}$ is an infinite subset of $B$ such that each $f_{b_i}$ is continuous. W.l.o.g. we may assume that $\lVert{b_i}\rVert=1$ . Let $$y:=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac1{2^i}b_i.$$ (Since $X$ is complete, the above sum converges.) We also denote $y_n:=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac1{2^i}b_i$ . Since $y_n$ converges to $y$ , we have $f_{b_k}(y)=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} f_{b_k}(y_n)=\frac1{2^k}$ for each $k\in\mathbb N$ . Thus the point $y$ has infinitely many non-zero coordinates, which contradicts the definition of Hamel basis. I have stumbled upon Exercise 4.3 in the book Christopher Heil: A Basis Theory Primer. Springer, New York, 2011. In this exercise we are working in an infinite-dimensional space $X$ . Basically the same notation as I mentioned above is introduced, $a_i$ 's are called coefficient functionals and then it goes as follows: (a) Show by example that it is possible for some particular functional $a_i$ to be continuous. (b) Show that $a_i(x_j) = \delta_{ij}$ for $i,j\in I$ . (c) Let $J = \{i\in I : a_i \text{ is continuous}\}$ . Show that $\sup \{\lVert a_j \rVert: j\in J\}<+\infty$ (d) Show that at most finitely many functionals $a_i$ can be continuous, i.e., $J$ is finite. (e) Give an example of an infinite-dimensional normed linear space that has a Hamel basis $\{x_i; i\in I\}$ such that each of the associated coefficient functionals $a_i$ for $i\in I$ is continuous. The part (c) can be shown easily using Banach-Steinhaus theorem (a.k.a. Uniform boundedness principle). But I guess that the author of the book has in mind a different proof for part (d) from what I sketched above, since (c) is an easy consequence of (d) -- so he would probably not be put the exercises in this order. (But maybe I was just trying to read to much between the lines.) Question: I was not able to find a proof od (d) which uses (c). Do you have some idea how to do this?

However, this just updates a one dimensional subspace of the matrix. In my application it would be more natural to scale the whole matrix instead of performing a rank one update, but just a simple scaling is not enough because it cannot be consistent for all the Ax's.

Thus $$ f = g + h ,~~~\text{where}~~g=\int_a^x f' .$$ My goal is to show that $g=0$ almost everywhere. Let $I=\bigcup (y_k,x_k).$  Then 
$$ \int_I f' = \sum \int_{(x_k,y_k)}~f' = \sum\left(f(x_k)-f(y_k)\right)\lt \epsilon.$$ Now, I know that since $f'$ is integrable, there is an $\epsilon$ such that $$\int_{[a,b]\setminus I}~f'\lt \epsilon. $$ But $$\begin{align*}
0\leq \int_a^b f' & = \int_I f'+\int_{[a,b]\setminus I}~f'\\

79333,How many strategies are there for this puzzle where one of n logicians must call his own hat's color among n?,"$n$ logicians are wearing hats which can be of $n$ different colors. Each logician can see the colors of all hats except his own. The logicians must simultaneously call out a color; they win if at least one calls the color of his own hat. Mathematically, a strategy is an element of $(C^{n-1} \to C)^n$ where $C$ is the set of hat colors ($\mathrm{card}(C) = n$); a strategy $(d_0,\ldots,d_{n-1})$ is given by the decision procedures of each logician, where logician $k$ calls out $d_k(h_0, \ldots, h_{k-1}, h_{k+1}, \ldots, h_{n-1})$ when the hat colors are $(h_0, \ldots, h_{n-1})$. One winning strategy for this classic puzzle is having numbered the logicians and the colors, each logician calls the color that is his own number minus the sum of the hat colors that he sees (all modulo $n$). Then whoever has the number corresponding to the sum of the colors is calling out his own hat's color. This isn't the only solution. (Hint: the case $n=2$ is easy. Now concentrate on $n=4$ and try to reduce it to the previous case.) You can rephrase the strategy above this way: let $h_0, \ldots, h_{n-1}$ be the hat colors of logicians $0, \ldots, n-1$; logician $k$ calls out the value of $h_k$ that makes the equation $h_0 + \ldots + h_{n-1} = k$ true. More generally, equip the set of colors $C = \{c_0, \ldots, c_{n-1}\}$ with any group structure $(C, *)$, and assign each logician a unique color $\ell_k$; then a winning strategy is for each logician $k$ to solve the equation $h_0 * h_1 * \ldots * h_{n-1} = \ell_k$ for $h_k$ and call out the solution. Hence every group structure leads to a winning strategy. Are the strategies presented above are all there is? If not, is there a reasonable way to describe the collection of all winning strategies, such as relating them to another well-known mathematical structure? For example, how many distinct strategies are there for a given $n$?","['puzzle', 'abstract-algebra', 'combinatorics']"

where $A$ is any abelian group, $\Delta(A)$ is the constant sheaf of $A$ on $X$, and the $H^0$ appearing on the LHS refers to singular cohomology, so it is quite plausible to me that the higher cohomology groups should also coincide. Of course, the trouble is that a scheme is more than just a topological space; in some sense the underlying space is irrelevant and simply provides a setting on which the structure sheaf can be defined. How does one recapture the traditional geometric invariants of, say, a complex variety in the world of algebraic geometry? To be a bit more precise, suppose $X$ is a smooth projective algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$, viewed as a scheme. It seems highly implausible to me that $H^i(X, \mathbb{Z})$ (in the sense of either singular cohomology or sheaf cohomology) should yield anything of interest, given the coarseness of the Zariski topology.
