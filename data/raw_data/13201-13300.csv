103876,Open sets in a metric space,"Prove that the following are open sets: (a)  the “first quadrant,” $\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R^2}\mid x>0 
\text{ and }y>0\}$ (b)  any subset of a discrete metric space I'm using the following definition of an open set in a metric space $(X,d)$: a set $A$ is open if $\forall a\in A,\exists r>0$ s.t. $B_r(a)\subseteq A$. For (a), the metric space is $(\mathbb{R^2},d)$. For $r\in\mathbb{R}$ and $r>0$ An open ball of radius $r$ around $x_o\in\mathbb{R^2}$ is $B_r(x_o)=\{x\in\mathbb{R^2}\mid d(x,x_o)<r\}$ $\subseteq\mathbb{R^2}$. So basically I need to show that I can find an open ball with radius $r$ around any point in the first quadrant that is a subset of the first quadrant. Attempt at (a): Let $x_o\in\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R^2}\mid x>0\text{ and }y>0\}$. Suppose that $\forall r\in\mathbb{R}$, $B_r(x_o)\not\subseteq A$. Then, $\exists r\in\mathbb{R}$ s.t. $B_r(x_o)\subseteq A^{c}$. But that means $x_o$ has negative components even though its in the first quadrant? Attempt at (b): For (b), Let $a_o\in A\subseteq X$. Then, $d(a_o,a)<2\in\mathbb{R},\forall a\in A$. Since $a_o$ was arbitrary there exists an $r>0$ for all $a\in A$ such that the open ball $B_r(a)$ is a subset $A$.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

Postscripts: The original problem in magazine ( ISSN 1005-6416 ) might be (For a long time, I can't remember clearly): $a, b$ are irrationals, subjects to $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z^+}: \left\{ na \right\} + \left\{ nb \right\} \le 1$, prove that $a + b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Because I've found that $a, b$ needn't have been irrationals, I insist that there be a general proof (I think it's algebrian). I think the steps are like this: Divides $\left\{ (x, y) | x, y \in \mathbb{R^+}, x + y < 1 \right\}$ into many (infinity) pieces. For each piece, we obtain a $n$. It may be easy when $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}$. Here's the proof: Let $f(n) = \left\{na\right\} + \left\{nb\right\}$.
For each $x \not \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have
$\left\{x\right\} + \left\{-x\right\} = 1$ So if $a, b \in \mathbb{Q}$, we have
$f(1) + f(-1) = 2$ Note that:
$\exists T \in \mathbb{Z^+}$ subjects to $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}: f(n + T) = f(n)$ So
$2 = f(1) + f(-1) = f(1) + f(2T-1) \le 2 \max\left(f(1), f(2T-1)\right)$ We've done. I'd like a proof with algebraic construction. Thanks","['algebra-precalculus', 'ceiling-and-floor-functions']"
103898,Need help with multi-variable calculus,"I have an expression of the form: $$\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp \left\{ \frac{-1}{2\sigma^2} (x-\mu)^2 \right\} dx = \sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}$$ and I need to take its derivative with respect to $\sigma^2$.

103899,Existence of the measure without Axiom of Choice,"Let $X$ be any set and $\mathscr F$ be a $\sigma$-algebra of its subsets, so $(X,\mathscr F)$ is a measure space. The function

\mu:\mathscr F\to[0,\infty]

is called a measure if $\quad 1.$ $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$, $\quad 2.$ for any sequence $(B_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ such that $B_i\cap B_j = \emptyset$ it holds that
$$
\mu\left(\bigcup\limits_{n\in\mathbb N}B_n\right) = \sum\limits_{n\in\mathbb N}\mu(B_n).
$$ Let us consider a set-valued function $f:\mathscr F\to\mathscr P([0,\infty])$ where $\mathscr P$ denotes the powerset. Suppose that $\quad 1^*.$ $0\in f(\emptyset)$ $\quad2^*.$ for any sequence $(B_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ such that $B_i\cap B_j = \emptyset$ and any sequence $x_n\in f(B_n)$ it holds that

for any set $B\in\mathscr F$. I wonder if the question can be answered assuming Axiom of Choice and without this assumption. Remark 1: clearly if $f(B)$ is a singleton for any $B\in\mathscr F$, which satisfies both of assumptions above, the measure $\mu_f$ exists, $\mu_f = f$. Remark 2: thanks to Alexander, in the case when $f(\emptyset)$ contains a positive element, we can take $\mu_f(B) = \infty$ for any all $B\in\mathscr F\setminus\{\emptyset\}$. So the only unconsidered case is $f(\emptyset) = \{0\}$.","['measure-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"
103912,Partition function without repetitions of parts and largest part $k$,"Um, well, I think the title pretty much says it all. Nevertheless, allow me to explain. I am aware of a certain partition function $Q(n, k)$ that is supposed to remove duplication of parts and $k$ is the number of terms it contains. I have a hunch that like $P(n, k)$ where $k$ limits the number of parts is equivalent to $k$ being the largest part, the same would apply to $Q(n, k)$. But then, I think probably not. I'd like to know if any generating functions exist for what I have described ( both removal of duplicate/repeated parts and largest part $k$). And one last question if you can't (or can, whatever) answer that question, is $Q(n, k)$ always lesser than n? (I think so...) Well, thanks for stopping to read this and to anyone who bothered to help!
PS Note that $q(n, k)$ and $Q(n, k)$ are different! Head over to Wolfram|Alpha for more detail. Edit 1 I'm sorry, but I'm just a high school student (Class IX) and don't know what that is supposed to mean. Hope you can help me with it, thanks again. Question 1: Where did this new variable $x$ come in from? Question 2: One more thing, does this generating function produce a result always lesser than $m$? The last question: If I'm right, I can interpret the core of your statement (excl. the coefficient part) as the product $(1 + x^k)$ as $k$ varies from $1$ to $k$... where's $m$ in all this? And for what am I going to find the coefficient of $x^m$, given there is no $x^m$ in the equation? (I'm pretty sure that ain't an algebraic coefficient) Edit 2 Heck Mr. Garry, I just forgot that! Well, if $x$ is a placeholder of sorts, but what is it actually doing there if it's not supposedto be there? That said, is it a reference to any kind of big pi notation or such? Edit 3 Fine, I've understood it now. I'm telling this here as writing it as an answer seems to look  like me answering myself. Anyway, now that I think about it, is it further possible to restrict $Q(n, k)$ so as to include only, say, $t$ parts, such that it becomes a function where n is partitioned into $t$ parts - no less, no more - and the largest part is $k$? Is that possible? Oh my. I seriously ask a lot of questions.","['integer-partitions', 'generating-functions', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

103920,Relationship between Hölder continuity and differentiability of Brownian motion,"I came across the following exercise: Let $(B_t)_{t\geq 0}$ be a Brownian motion. Show that, almost surely, there is no interval $(r,s)$ on which $t\to B_t$ is Hölder continuous of exponent $\alpha$ for any $\alpha>\frac{1}{2}$. Explain the relation of this result to the differentiability properties of $B$. I'm happy about the first part, but am wondering how this relates to the differentiability of $B$. This property alone isn't strong enough to ensure that the paths are nowhere differentiable (which they are). Does it perhaps imply that $B$ is almost surely not differentiable on any open interval? So it would be informative to answer the question: If $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is not Lipschitz on any open interval, then does every open interval contain a point at which $f$ is non-differentiable?

103938,Is $|z|^2$ complex differentiable?,"I think I am a bit confused about the definition of (complex) differentiability. Yes, I know that's stupid, but I am hoping that someone could clear it up for me. I know that the definition of (complex) differentiability is when $\lim\limits_{h\to 0}{f(z+h)-f(z)\over h}$ exists. So, is $|z|^2$ considered differentiable? What I think is it is only differentiable at $z=0$ since at any other point if we take $f(z+h)-f(z)\over h$  as $h\to 0$ along a contour line of $|z|^2$ then the limit is $0$ whereas if we take a path say perpendicular to the contour lines, the ""gradient"" wouldn't be $0$, right?

the same size as the original. Despite being called a paradox it is of course a theorem. Looking at the proof, it seems to rely heavily on the Axiom of Choice. However since the consequences of not accepting the Axiom of Choice seem even more weird, I am wondering whether the more experienced Mathematicians here find the implication of Banach-Tarski a perfectly acceptable Theorem, or whether it shows that ZF with Choice is actually ultimately pathological ?

104125,Help with removing singularities involving $ \int_{1}^{\infty} \exp\left( - \frac{x^2}{2y^{2r}} - \frac{y^2}{2}\right) \frac{dy}{y^r}$,"This post can be thought of as the prototype proof and the motivation for the question posted here Using a laplace type expansion to get bounds on an integral arising in the study of Brownian motion Let $ 0 < r < 1$, fix $x > 1$ and consider the integral $$ I_{1}(x) = \int_{1}^{\infty} \exp\left( - \frac{x^2}{2y^{2r}} - \frac{y^2}{2}\right) \frac{dy}{y^r}.$$ The result we have been trying to prove below can be thought of as an analysis of localizing around the maximum of the function $f(y) = \frac{x^2}{2y^{2r}} + \frac{y^2}{2}$ in the exponential of the integrand and then applying appropriate estimates along with integration by parts. Roughly speaking I am having trouble with the analysis on one side of the maximum. Let $I_1(x) = \int_{1}^{\infty}  \exp( -\frac{x^2}{2y^{2r}} - \frac{y^2}{2} ) \frac{dy}{y^r}$ and fix a constant $c^* = r^{\frac{1}{2r+2}} $ that is $c^* = argmin ( d(c) )$ where $d(c) = \frac{1}{2} (c^{-2r} + c^2)$ and let $x^* = x^{\frac{1}{1+r}}$.  Then we break up the integral as $$I_1(x): = I_{11}(x) + I_{12}(x) =
 \int_{1}^{c^* x^*}  \exp( -\frac{x^2}{2y^{2r}} - \frac{y^2}{2} ) \frac{dy}{y^r} +  \int_{c^*x^*}^{\infty}  \exp( -\frac{x^2}{2y^{2r}} - \frac{y^2}{2} ) \frac{dy}{y^r} $$ The particular trouble I am having arises with estimating $I_{11}$. Using integration by parts on $I_{11}(x)$ we set $f(y) =  \frac{x^2}{2y^{2r}} + \frac{y^2}{2}$ and write 
$$ I_{11}(x)  =  \int_{1}^{c^* x^*}  \exp( -\frac{x^2}{2y^{2r}} - \frac{y^2}{2} ) \frac{dy}{y^r}  = \int_{1}^{c^* x^*} \frac{y^{-r}}{f'(y)} f'(y) e^{-f(y)} dy$$ Let $v = \frac{1}{y^r f'(y)}, du = f'(y) e^{-f(y)}dy$ so that $u = - e^{-f(y)}$ and $dv = \frac{-r y^{-r-1}f'(y) -y^{r} f''(y) }{(f'(y))^2}$ and write $$dv = \frac{-r y^{-r-1}}{f'(y)} dy - \frac{y^{-r} f''(y)}{(f'(y))^2}dy := v_1(y)dy + v_2(y)dy$$ Applying integration by parts to $I_{11}(x)$ we get $$ \int_{1}^{c^* x^*} \frac{y^{-r}}{f'(y)} f'(y) e^{-f(y)} dy = \left[- \frac{y^{-r}}{f'(y)} exp(-f(y)) \right]_{1}^{c^* x^*} +  \int_{1}^{c^* x^*} e^{-f(y)} (v_1(y) +v_2(y)) dy $$ 1) Using this argument is it possible to show $I_{11}(x) \leq k(r,x)\exp(- x^{\frac{2}{1+r}} d(c^*))$ where $k(r,x)$ is a rational function in $x$? The issue seems to be for us finding a way to remove the singularities around $v_1$ and $v_2$ near $c^* x^*$.","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
104130,Are neighbourhood and open neighbourhood always exchangeable in statements?,"From Wikipedia If $X$ is a topological space and $p$ is a point in $X$, a neighbourhood of $p$ is a subset $V$ of $X$, which includes an open
  set $U$ containing $p$, Note that the neighbourhood $V$ need not be an open set itself. If $V$
  is open it is called an open neighbourhood . Some authors require that
  neighbourhoods be open, so it is important to note conventions. Clearly  neighbourhood and open neighbourhood are two different concepts. But in the limited number of statements I have seen and can recall, neighbourhood and open neighbourhood can always replace each other without changing the statements from true to false, or from false to true. So I was wondering if neighbourhood and open neighbourhood can always be exchangeable in statements? If not always, is it most of the cases? What are some statements where exchanging between neighbourhood and open neighbourhood matters? Well, a trivial example is: ""an open neighbourhood is a neighbourhood"" is true while ""a neighbourhood is an open  neighbourhood"" isn't. But these exemplar statements  are not really meaningful.

In local class field theory, the multiplicative group modulo the norm group is isomorphic to the Galois group both algebraically and topologically. So is the topology we just defined on infinite Galois group is ""forced to define"" because of that isomorphism? If you teach such a course in Galois theory, how would you convince your students that this topology comes out in ""natural""? There is another way topology arise: by study prime $p$, we deduce the $p$-adic topology, we complete the space we get local field and also a topological field. Can we realize that all the topologies that arise in number theory are just a mimic of that? Since I am not a math major, I get into math since my teacher teach me quadratic reciprocity when I was a high schooler, I led all the way myself to class field theory and get lost when I encounter the ""modern language"" such as Galois cohomology and schemes.
I saw a remark that in order to gain arithmetic information we need a ground base: the direct product of all $\mathbb{Q}_p$ ($p$-adic number field), but since it is not locally compact, we can not apply analysis on it, so we make restricted product and get idèles and adèles. I know little about analysis and I get puzzled. Hecke proved quadratic reciprocity for number field using Fourier analysis and Tate has a famous ""Thesis"", both of which confused me. Can someone explain that to me, what led these guys to do that,and what were they doing? Finally I summarize my odd words: Why we introduce topology to various group such as a Galois group, and how do we realize that topology? Why, in doing arithmetic, do we need a locally compact group or field to apply ""analysis""? what is ""apply analysis"" all about?

Now because the basic open sets $X_f = \{\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Spec} (A) : \{f\} \not\subseteq \mathfrak{p} \}$ form a basis for the Zariski Topology it suffices to consider the case when $$X = \bigcup_{i \in I} X_{f_i}$$ where $I$ is some index set. Then taking the complement on both sides we get that $$\emptyset = \bigcap_{i \in I} X_{f_i}^c$$ so there is no prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$ such that all the $f_i$ 's are in $\mathfrak{p}$ . Now from here I am able to show that the ideal generated by the $f_i$ 's is the whole ring as follows. Since there is no prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ such that all the $f_i \in \mathfrak{p}$ , it is clear that there is no $\mathfrak{p}$ such that $(f_i) \subseteq \mathfrak{p}$ for all $i \in I.$ Taking a sum over all the $i$ then gives $$\sum_{i \in I} (f_i) = (1).$$ Now here's the problem: How do I show from here that there is an equation of the form $1 = \sum_{i \in J} f_ig_i,$ where $g_i \in A$ and $J$ some finite subset of $I$ ?

[a_{ij}]^*=[a_{ji}^*],\qquad\text{where}\quad [a_{ij}]\in M_{n,n}(\mathcal{A}).

Thus we have an involutive algebra $M_{n,n}(\mathcal{A})$. It is well known  that there exist at most one norm on $M_{n,n}(\mathcal{A})$ making it a $C^*$-algebra. This norm does exist. Indeed take universal representation $\pi:\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}(H)$ and define linear injective $^*$-homomorphism

Hence we can define norm on $M_{n,n}(\mathcal{A})$ as $\left\Vert[a_{ij}]\right\Vert_{M_{n,n}(\mathcal{A})}=\Vert\Pi([a_{ij}])\Vert$.

104444,Soccer and Probability,"MOTIVATION : I will quote Wikipedia's article on a soccer goalkeeper for the motivation: Some goalkeepers have even scored goals. This most commonly occurs where a goalkeeper has rushed up to the opposite end of the pitch to give his team an attacking advantage in numbers. This rush is risky, as it leaves the goalkeeper's goal undefended. As such, it is normally only done late in a game at set-pieces where the consequences of scoring far outweigh those of conceding a further goal, such as for a team trailing in a knock-out tournament. The mathematical question :
Consider the following game (simplified soccer): A single player starts with a score of 0.5 and plays N turns.
In each turn, the player has to choose one of 2 strategies: $(p_{-1},p_0,p_1)$ or
$(q_{-1},q_0,q_1)$ (these are probability vectors) and then her score is increased by -1, 0 or 1 according to the probabilites dictated by the chosen strategy. The player wins if at the end of the game she has a positive score, and loses if she has a negative score (the player's objective is to win, the only thing that matters is whether the final score is positive or negative). What is the optimal global strategy given $N$, $(p_{-1},p_0,p_1)$ and
$(q_{-1},q_0,q_1)$? A global strategy is a function of the number of turns left, the current score and the 2 probability vectors (which are constant for all turns). If this question is hard, it may still may interesting to approximate an optimal global strategy (in what sense?).","['game-theory', 'recreational-mathematics', 'probability']"

  E). I understand interior points. Ofcourse given a point $p$ you can have any radius $r$ that makes this neighborhood fit into the set. Thats how I see it, thats how I picture it. I can't understand limit points. It seems trivial to me that lets say you have a point $p$. Then one of its neighborhood is exactly the set in which it is contained, right? ie, you can pick a radius big enough that the neighborhood fits in the set. Ofcourse I know this is false.

104684,basic calculus proof - using theorems to prove stuff,"A function $f(x)$ is defined and continuous on the interval $[0,2]$ and $f(0)=f(2)$. 
Prove that the numbers $x,y$ on $[0,2]$ exist such that $y-x=1$ and $f(x) = f(y)$. I can already guess this is going to involve the intermediate value theorem. 
So far I've defined things as such:
I'm looking to satisfy the following conditions for values x, y: $f(x) = f(x+1)$ $f(x) = f(y)$ I've defined another function, $g(x)$ such that $g(x) = f(x+1) - f(x)$
If I can show that there exists an $x$ such that $g(x) = 0$ then I've also proven that $f(x) = f(x+1)$. since I'm given the interval [0,2], I can show that: $g(1) = f(2) - f(1)$, $g(0) = f(1) - f(0)$ I'm told that $f(2) = f(0)$ so I can rearrange things to show that $g(1) = f(0) - f(1) = -g(0)$. 
Ok, So i've shown that $g(0) = -g(1)$ How do I tie this up? I'm not able to close this proof. I know I need to incorporate the intermediate value theorem which states that if there's a point c in $(a,b)$ then there must be a value $a<k<b$ such that $f(k) = c $ because there's nothing else. I thought maybe to use Rolle's theorem to state that since $f(0) = f(2)$ I know this function isn't monotonic. And if it's not monotonic it must have a ""turning point"" where $f'(x) = 0$ but it's not working out. 
Anyway I need help with this proof in particular and perhaps some advice on solving proofs in general since this type of thing takes me hours. Thanks.",['calculus']

104696,"pre-compactness, total boundedness and ""Cauchy sequential compactness""","From Wikipedia : A metric space is called pre-compact or totally bounded if any
  sequence has a Cauchy subsequence; this can be generalised to uniform
  spaces. Alternatively, pre-compactness and total boundedness can be defined differently for a uniform space (note that a metric space is a uniform space): Pre-compact subspace is a subset whose closure is compact. A subset $S$ of a uniform space $X$ is totally bounded if and
  only if, given any entourage $E$ in $X$, there exists a finite cover
  of $S$ by subsets of $X$ each of whose Cartesian squares is a subset
  of $E$. Let me call a uniform space to be Cauchy sequential compact, if any
sequence in it has a Cauchy subsequence. I was wondering if For a metric space, pre-compactness, total boundedness and Cauchy
sequential compactness are all equivalent? Same question for a uniform space? Added: Pre-compactness in the first quote is defined differently from the
one in the second quote. So now my question is narrowed down to
whether total boundedness and Cauchy sequential compactness are
equivalent in both metric spaces and uniform spaces. Pete's reply says yes for metric spaces, and now  what can we say
about uniform spaces? Thanks and regards!",['general-topology']

The usual explanation is usually some handwavey argument about following such a function around the unit circle, and getting a contradiction at $e^{2\pi i}$ or something. I've been a little unsatisfied with these. What is a more formal, rigorous proof that there is no continuous log function on $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$ that is understandable to a nonexpert?

104733,Does this set of vectors span the space of all polynomials of degree at most 3?,"I'm having trouble understanding this homework problem. Suppose four polynomials are defined by the following: $
p_{1}(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 1 \\
p_{2}(x) = x^2 - x + 2 \\
p_{3}(x) = 2x^3 + 3x + 4 \\
p_{4}(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1 \\
$ Does the set $S = $ { ${p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}}$ } span $P_{3}$ (the space of all polynomials of degree at most 3)? So if I start with the polynomial $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ I understand(I think) that in order for $S$ to span $P_{3}$ then $y$ must be a linear combination of $S$ but I'm not sure where to go from there. EDIT: $$
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 & 1\\ 
0 & 1 & -1 & 2\\ 
2 & 0 & 3 & 4\\ 
0 & 3 & 2 & 1

0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\

$$ So $\operatorname{rank}(A) = 4$ which means the vectors in the set are linearly independent because there are only 4 column vectors in the matrix (AND there is only the trivial solution to the matrix) and therefore we span $P_{3}$?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
104735,Can cross partial derivatives exist everywhere but be equal nowhere?,"In 1949 Tolstov proved that there exists $f:\mathbb{R^2} \to \mathbb{R}$ so that $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist and are continuous everywhere and $f_{xy}$ and $f_{yx}$ exist everywhere and differ on a set of positive Lebesgue measure.  I have also heard that he provided an example where the cross partials do not exist everywhere but differ on a set of full measure.  The only copies of the papers I have heard of are in Russian so I could not read them to find his examples.  In any case I would still like to play around with those questions a bit more on my own before looking up the answers. I am wondering if any further progress on this question is reasonably well known?  It seems like this question is natural enough that it should either be a known open research problem or solved, though I may be wrong on that.  My intuition says that if the cross partials can differ on a set of positive measure or even a.e. (but not necessarily exist everywhere) then it should probably be the case that they can exist and be different everywhere, though I would not be surprised to be proven completely wrong. More broadly, if anyone has a good way of thinking about functions with cross partial derivatives which exist everywhere and are different on some ""large"" set I would be interested in getting a better feel for what kind of pathological behavior I should be looking for.","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"

104743,crazy problem - does it have a solution? number theory perhaps?,"A few researchers are trying to crack a code which involves discovering the values of three integers. They know they are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and that they may be the same. They each have a different piece of information; Alice knows the geometric mean Bob knows the arithmetic mean Chris knows the arithmetic mean of the squares They get together to share information and crack the code, but they are being very secretive in an attempt to conceal their results from anyone else. You listen in to their conversation; Chris: “I don't know all of the numbers” Alice: “I don't know any of the numbers” Chris: “You didn't need to tell me that, I knew that already” Alice: “Well now I know all the numbers!” Chris: “I still don't know all the numbers” Bob: “I don't know all of the numbers either” Chris: “Argh, I still don't know all the numbers” Bob: “Ah - now I know all of the numbers” “A ha!” you cry. For they have accidentally revealed the numbers to you. What are they? You should assume these researchers always tell the truth and make perfect deductions and calculations. However, they might not always be as precise as they could be; “I don't know all the numbers” does not necessarily mean that they know any of the numbers.

I understand that the $\pi$ will appear when I integrate something over the angle $\phi$ in polar coordinates. But I don't know how to find the square of the absolute value of the right-hand side to even start integrating... EDIT: The function is supposed to be univalent (one-to-one).
