1270303,Number of Real roots of cubic,"I just have a quick question about a polynomial and its roots, For example, I was solving the differential equation $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{3x^2+4x+2}{2y-2}$$ I solved it using the basic methods of separation and solved the solution implicitly as $y^2-2y=(x^3+2x^2+2x+D)$,  $D \in \mathbb{R}$ so when I want to solve for $y$ explicitly, I solve the quadratic and get the form, $$y=1\pm\sqrt{1+(x^3+2x^2+2x+D)}$$ Now, my question is in regard to the cubic $\mathbb{P}=x^3+2x^2+2x+1+D$ My book noted without explanation that , $\mathbb{P}$ is such that for all $D \in \mathbb{R}$, only one real root exists, call it $r(D)$. My question is, how was this seen so easily? I think there might be something very simple I am missing potentially.

1270343,Wouldn't this Greedy Algorithm achieve the highest possible of money in this situation?,"I am doing a practice question from Midterm Dynamic Programming The Problem :
Consider a row of n numbers a1, ..., an. The numbers are all positive, and n is even. We play a
game against an opponent, alternating turns. In each turn, a player selects either the first or last
number, removes it from the row, and collects that much money. For example, if the numbers are 1,2,3,4 , a possible game may look like: Player A takes 4: row is 1,2,3. Player B takes 3: row is 1,2. Player A takes 1: row is 2. Player B takes 2, game over. Both players ended with a total amount of 5. Note that A could have done better. (2 pts) Show an example where the greedy algorithm fails to achieve the highest possible amount of money. The solution to this problem Greedy Sol used a solution list of number of [1,2,10,3]. However I would argue using the greedy algorithm, "" In each turn, a player selects either the first or last"" would work here to achieve the highest amount of money. Here is how I would work out the greedy algorithm Player A takes 1: row is 2, 10, 3. Player B takes 3: row is 2, 10. Player A takes 2: row is 10. Player B takes 10, game over. And Player B has achieved the highest possible amount of money, 13. Does everyone agree with my walkthrough and that the solution is wrong? The solution I came up was 2, 8, 7, 6, 4. The idea I had here was that the highest amount of money could only be achieved by the player picking first(3 numbers). For the player who picks first to achieve the highest possible amount of money. he or she would have to pick 8, 7, and 6. However with this greedy algorithm, that player in the first move either has to choose 2 or 4, meaning the highest possible amount of money is not achievable.(bc player 1 was the only player that could achieve the highest amount of money)","['discrete-mathematics', 'recursive-algorithms', 'algorithms', 'optimization', 'logic']"

1270411,The closure of a subspace of a normed vector space is a subspace,"This is a self-study problem (Folland Real Analysis exercise 5.5). If $\mathcal{X}$ is a normed vector space, the closure of any subspace of $\mathcal{X}$ is a subspace. My attempt: It is evident that $0 \in \overline{\mathcal{M}}$. Let $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathcal{X}$ and consider $v,w \in \overline{\mathcal{M}}$. As $v$ is a limit point, there is some sequence $\{v_n\} \to v$ in the metric induced by the norm; namely for some $N$, $\|v_n - v\| \le \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ for $n \ge N$, and likewise for $w$. Then, for scalars $a,b$, $$\|av_n+bw_n - (av + bw)\| = \|av_n - av + bw_n - bw\| \le |a|\|v_n - v\| + |b|\|w_n - w\| = \epsilon(|a|+|b|).$$ Therefore, $\mathcal{M} \supset \{av_n+bw_n\} \to av+bw$, so $av+bw \in \overline{\mathcal{M}}$.

I've been approaching the problem the way we were taught in class. This is what I've done so far: 1) I rewrote it as $\lim_{\to\infty}  \int^{A}_{-A} \frac{x^2}{{(x^2-8x+20)}^2} \, dx$ 2) In order to use the Residue Theorem we must be integrating over a closed contour. I picked a semi-circle centered at the origin in the upper half plane.  From here I started to find the singularities so that I could compute the residues. From what I understand, the singularities are the zeros of the denominator in a rational function.  I came up with -2 and 10. 10 is in the domain that I chose. So from here prior to computing the residues, we've been told to break the integral into two pieces... honestly this is where I get confused. Can someone help me continue? I'm still feeling a little confused and I'm hoping to see the solution to this problem done out so that I can see where I'm going wrong.

1270525,De Rham-Weil theorem,"I am having trouble understanding a couple of points with regard to the De Rham-Weil theorem and was hoping that someone might be able to shed some light. Let $X$ be a smooth manifold and $\mathcal{F}$ the sheaf of abelian groups on $X$. The theorem states that $H^q(X,\mathcal{F}) \cong H^q((A^{\bullet}(X),d_x))$, where $(A^{\bullet}(X),d_x)$ is the complex of global sections for an acyclic resolution $0 \rightarrow \mathcal{F} \rightarrow A^{\bullet}$. But, if I understand the definition correctly (I suppose I don't), an acyclic resolution has trivial higher cohomology groups. Then the theorem would imply that for for any sheaf the higher cohomology groups are trivial? Further, I have a proposition in my notes saying that any soft resolution of $\mathcal{F}$ is acyclic . But, for example, the Canonical resolution is soft, but higher cohomology groups are zero only if $\mathcal{F}$ is soft itself, correct? At the risk of sounding dumb, what is wrong with this picture?

Tiles can be rotated, so I'd like to count the number of unique tiles. The game comes with 35 tiles. Should I treat this as a coloring problem on the number of pairs of points and try using Polya enumeration? If so, I'd appreciate a hint. Is there a better method -- something easy that I'm missing?

1270549,Difference between conditional expectation and conditional probabilty,"These are known definitions :
We have a probability space $(\Omega, A, P)$ Conditional probability is defined through $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, P(B) > 0$. This is a real nunmber . Then also where is conditional expectation $E[X|A_0]$ with $A_0$ being some subalgebra. This is a random variable. In the special case when $A_0$ is generated by a random variable $Y$ we also write $E[X|\sigma(Y)] = E[X|Y]$ and using the factorization theorem you can also write $E[X|Y]$ as a RV of $Y$ which you then denote as $E[X|Y=y]$. For $X$ being in indicator function we sometimes also write $E[1_A | Y=y] =: P(A | Y = y)$ which confuses me very much, because this now is the evaluation of an only a.s. defined RV I am particular confused with the proof I state in this Question . Since the probability of $\{X_1 = i_1, ... X_{n-1} = i_{n-1}\}$ is 0 because the $X_i$ are real valued, the proof can't be talking about conditional probabilities. Thus I think the proof uses the sloppy notation for conditional expectation $E[1_B(X_n) | X_1 = i_1, ... X_{n-1} = i_{n-1}] =: P(X_n \in B | X_1 = i_1, ... X_{n-1} = i_{n-1})$. Now in this concept, I dont understand why the single steps in the proof are true. They are all obvious true for $P(|)$ being conditional probability, but in my eye not trivial for $P(|)$ being conditional expectations","['probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation', 'probability', 'markov-chains']"

$$\int_{1/3}^{\sqrt{2}/3} \dfrac{1}{x\sqrt{9x^2-1}}{dx}$$
So, I am to use $u$-substitution, and immediately, it would appear that perhaps the integral may be some function of x in the form $\sqrt{x}, \ln{x},$ or possibly some inverse trigonometric function. So I feel like the most progress I've made was in taking $u = 9x^2 -1 \implies du = 18x {\ dx}$. The concept of this method is very strange to me, as well (though seemingly I know how to apply it, in most cases), because, conceptually, taking and moving the $dx$ in place of the $du$ arithmetically seems a little bit like having $1+1 = 11$. Perhaps I just don't understand exactly what it's all implying?

1270673,Geometric intuition about the exterior derivative,"Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. One $k$-form is a section of the bundle $\bigwedge^k T^\ast M$, that is, if $p\in M$ and $\omega$ is a $k$-form then $\omega_p$ is one $k$-linear alternating real function defined in the cartesian product of $k$ copies of the tangent space at $p$. Given $\omega$ one can then build a new differential $k+1$ form called the exterior derivative $d\omega$. This can be easily defined in a coordinate system $(x,U)$ as $$d\omega = \sum_{}d\omega_{i_1\dots i_k}\wedge dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_k}$$ where $\omega_{i_1\dots i_k}$ are the components of $\omega$ in the coordinate system $(x,U)$. One then can easily show this definition doesn't depend on the coordinate system chosen. Based on that it is possible to show many properties of the exterior derivative then. Now, the problem is that I simply can't get one geometrical intuition on what the exterior derivative is. As I know, a $k$-form can be thought of as an object which performs measurements on $k$-vectors, that is, an object capable of measuring projections of $k$-vectors. This point of view comes from the fact that $\bigwedge^k V^\ast$ is isomorphic to the space of linear functions on $\bigwedge^k V$. In that setting, what is the geometrical intuition behind the exterior derivative? Given one $k$-form how can one understand from one intuitive point of view what its exterior derivative is?","['differential-geometry', 'differential-forms', 'exterior-algebra']"

1270760,Finding the evolute of a parabola,"I previously tried to find the evolute of a parabola by using parameterisation by arc length. It didn't work. While I was hoping for an answer I kept working on it and came up with the following method (unfortunately, something is not quite right as it leads to a different result than the answer to my previous question). I would appreciate it if someone could tell me where I went wrong: Given $\gamma (t) = (t,t^2)$ we find $\gamma'(t) = (1,2t)$. Normalising we find the unit tangent vector to be $$ v(t) = {1 \over \sqrt{1 + 4 t^2}} \left (\begin{matrix} 1 \\ 2t \end{matrix}\right)$$ Since this vector is unit lenght, its derivative will be orthogonal to it so that $v'(t)$ should be the normal vector to the plane curve: $$ n(t) := v'(t) = {1\over (1+4 t^2)^{3/2}}  \left (\begin{matrix} -4t \\ 2(1 + 4t^2)^{2} +8t^2 \end{matrix}\right)$$ The curvature is $\kappa (t) = \|n(t)\|$ hence the radius of curvature is $r = {1\over \kappa (t)}$. Hence the equation for the evolute should be $$ e(t) = \gamma (t) + r n(t) =  \left (\begin{matrix} t \\ t^2 \end{matrix}\right) + {1\over \sqrt{16t^2 + (2(1+4t^2)^2 +8t^2)^2}} \left (\begin{matrix} -4t \\ 2(1+4t^2) + 8t^2 \end{matrix}\right)$$ (But the equation of the evolute (according to the answer by Chappers) should be

1270851,Does this technique for solving an ODE generalize?,"Apologies for what's probably a silly question to anyone who knows this stuff. I was looking at a question earlier and realized that $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ satisfy two different differential equations: $$u'' + u = 0$$ on the one hand, and $$u^2 + (u')^2 = 1$$ on the other.  Wondering if these were in any way connected, I tried differentiating the second equation, giving $$2 u u' + 2 u' u''= 0;$$ Factoring, $$2 u' (u + u'') = 0$$ so we have $$u' = 0 \qquad \text{or} \qquad u + u'' = 0$$ The former equation corresponds to the solution $u = 1$ and the latter corresponds to $\sin$ and $\cos$. Applying this to the differential equation
$$(u')^2 = 4 u^3 - g_2 u - g_3$$
we obtain
$$u' = 0 \qquad \text{or} \qquad 2 u'' - 12 u^2 + g_2 = 0.$$
Not having any intuition for the subject, I don't know if $2 u'' - 12 u^2 + g_2 = 0$ is in any sense ""better"" or ""worse"" than the original equation, though.  I can tell that differentiating both sides again doesn't appear to help. Question : is this technique part of a bigger picture?

1270888,under what conditions can orthogonal vector fields make curvilinear coordinate system?,"I am considering n-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$. For any $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$, $v_1(x), \cdots, v_n(x)$ are orthogonal vectors. As functions of $x$, $v_i$'s are differentiable and non-zero everywhere. For $i=1,\cdots,n$, let $\gamma_i(t_i)$ be integral curves driven by $v_i(x)$, i.e.
$$\frac{d\gamma_i(t_i)}{dt_i}=v_i(\gamma_i(t_i))).$$
The question is, can $v_i$ always be ""properly scaled"" such that $\gamma_i$'s can define a curvilinear coordinate system, i.e., any $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ can be expressed as $x(t_1,\cdots, t_n)$.

1271098,What makes differential forms special,"There are two natural structures defined on differential manifolds, namely tangent bundle and its dual cotangent bundle. An element of tangent bundle $TM$ at a base point $p\in M$ can be described by a differential operator $X$, also called a tangent vector. If we choose a coordiante for $p=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, then we have a natural basis for tangent vector space at $p$ and write $X=X^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$. Dually, an element of cotangent bundle $T^*M$ at the same base point $p$ can be described by a differential form $\theta$. Take dual basis of tangent vector space and we can write $\theta=\theta_idx^i$. Everything above concerning tangent bundle and cotangent bundle looks symmetric. However, we can do more on cotangent bundle. We may obtain a second-order differential form $\omega=d\theta=d\theta_i\wedge dx^i$ by exterior differential operating on cotangent bundle. While there's no sort of ""exterior tangent"" operatation on tangent bundle without imposing extra structure. In addition, there's a distinguished one-form, named ""tautology one-form"", on cotangent bundle while there's no distinguished tangent vector on tangent bundle. What makes differential form special?

I am interested in the existence of labelings $f: V \rightarrow L$ where the label $f(v)$ is determined by the labels of the predecessors of $v$. More formally, let there be a function $g_v:L^{\mathrm{indeg}(v)} \rightarrow L$ for each vertex $v \in V$. Does there exist a labeling $f : V \rightarrow L$ such that for every vertex $v \in V$ with predecessors $p_0, p_1,\ldots$ the following holds?
$$f(v) = g_v(f(p_0), f(p_1), \ldots)$$ Intuitively, it appears very clear to me that the acyclicity of $G$ guarantees the existence of such labelings $f$. But how do I prove that? For a trivial example, consider the infinite path $G = (\mathbb{Z}, \{(v,v+1):v\in\mathbb{Z}\})$, $L = \{0, 1\}$ and $g_v:L\rightarrow L:x\mapsto 1 - x$. In this case there are exactly two labelings, one that assigns 0 and 1 to every even and odd vertex, respectively, and the other with 0 and 1 switched. If we drop the requirement of acyclicity, a counterexample would be an odd directed cycle graph and $L$ and $g$ as in the example above. Here no labeling exists. In the case of finite DAGs, I would prove the existence inductively over an topological ordering of $G$, starting by an arbitrary label-assignment for vertices without ingoing edges and then iteratively constructing the labeling for vertices whose predecessors have already been labeled. However, I fail to generalize this technique to infinite graphs in the absence of an induction basis.","['coloring', 'compactness', 'graph-theory', 'infinite-graphs', 'general-topology']"

I believe that I can split up the function I've been given into two analytic functions and approach it with the theorem that way; but I'm not sure how to decide what to split the function into.","['polynomials', 'analyticity', 'complex-analysis', 'roots']"
1272012,"Find the inverse of $f(x,y) = (x+3y,3x+y)$","Given the function $f : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ as $f(x,y) = (x+3y,3x+y)$. Find $f^{-1}$ .( Assume $f$ is a bijection) I know how to find $f^{-1} (x) = (3x+2)$ or anything with one variable. But I am not sure how to proceed with 2 variables. Can anyone provide me with a step by step explanation? Thanks","['real-numbers', 'inverse', 'relations', 'functions']"
1272058,Prove special case of Brianchon's theorem using inversion,"Brianchon's theorem says: When a hexagon is circumscribed around a conic section, its principal
  diagonals (those connecting opposite vertices) meet in a single point. From interactive demo : (found at www.cut-the-knot.org ) The problem is to prove following special case: When a hexagon is circumscribed around a circle , its principal
  diagonals meet in a single point. However, the requirement is to use inversion . I don't have the right idea, could you help?","['inversive-geometry', 'geometry', 'circles', 'polygons']"
1272060,Connection between possibility of non-monotonic solutions to first-order delay differential equations and 1-d discrete dynamical systems?,"Is there a connection between the possibility of non-monotonic solutions, including periodic or other oscillatory solutions, arising in first-order autonomous delay differential equations such as the delay logistic equation $\frac{dN}{dt}=rN(1-\frac{N(t-\tau)}{K})$ and one-dimensional discrete dynamical systems such as the logistic map $x_{n+1}=rx_n(1-x_n)$, whereas this does not occur for first-order autonomous ordinary differential equations like the logistic equation $\frac{dN}{dt}=rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$)? Does the time-delay $\tau$ play a similar role to the discrete time-step in allowing solutions to break free of the restrictions of monotonic flow on a line? If so, can this be expressed precisely, or it merely a loose analogy?","['dynamical-systems', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'delay-differential-equations']"
1272064,Quadruple of Pythagorean triples with same area,"Can one find explicitly $a_i,b_i,c_i\in\Bbb N,i=1,2,3,4$ so that 
  $$ a_i<b_i, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad a_i^2+b_i^2=c^2_i \qquad\text{for } i=1,2,3,4$$
  and
  $$a_1b_1=a_2b_2=a_3b_3=a_4b_4, \qquad c_1<c_2<c_3<c_4.$$ Some context: A Pythagorean triple is a triple $(a,b,c)\in\Bbb N$ so that $a^2+b^2=c^2$. We say that $(a,b,c)$ is primitive if $a,b$ and $c$ are coprime . In the dedicated wikipedia article the following is written: $\big((20, 21, 29), (12, 35, 37)\big)$ is the first pair of primitive Pythagorean triples such that the induced triangles have same area $=210$. $\big( (4485,  5852,  7373), (3059, 8580, 9109), (1380, 19019, 19069)\big)$ is a triple of primitive Pythagorean triples such that the induced triangles have same area $=13123110$. For each natural number $n$, there exist $n$ Pythagorean triples with different hypotenuses and the same area. An equivalent formulation of the question above is: Is there any explicitly known quadruple of Pythagorean triples such that the induced triangles have same area? Note: A093536 claims that for such a quadruple, the area in question will be $\geq 10^{17}$. Note: These problem are equivalent for the following reasons: It follows from the basic fact that the area of a triangle associated to a Pythagorean triple $(a,b,c)$ is given by $ab/2$ and $2n^2=k^2$ has only $(0,0)$ as integer solution. BTW note that $a_i,b_i,c_i$ are coprime if and only if $\gcd(a_i,\gcd(b_i,c_i))=1$ for $i=1,\ldots,4$.","['pythagorean-triples', 'number-theory']"
