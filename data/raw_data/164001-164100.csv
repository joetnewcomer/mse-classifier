2855408,Soccer penalty shots,"Imagine a scenario where we have a soccer player who is shooting penalty shots. He makes his first shot with probability of failure $1/3$ , then his second with probability of failure $1/5$ and so on, and at the $n$ -th throw the probability of failure is $1/(2n+1)$ . During practice, he shoots $19$ consecutive kicks. What is the probability he succeeds in an even number of kicks? For each throw, the respective probability of success is $$1-\frac{1}{(2n+1)}= \frac{2n}{(2n+1)}$$ To find the total probability of success in an even number of throws, we must add the probability of $0$ successful shots, $2, 4, \cdots, 18$ . But the $2$ successful throws can be, for example, the $1$ st and the $2$ nd, or the $4$ th and the $19$ th. Then, obviously, we will multiply the $2$ .
So how do we calculate the individual probabilities? Any help will be highly appreciated!","['combinatorics', 'probability']"
2855464,How one can write the delta Dirac function using Fourier series expansion such that summation is performed over odd indices only?,"The delta Dirac function can be presented in the form of Fourier series expansion as
$$
\delta(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}
+\frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{n\ge 1} \cos (nx) \, .
$$
The proof is straightforward and can be found e.g. in this Mathworld Wolfram article . In a mathematical physics problem, I would like to make use of the Fourier series technique in order to solve a system of differential equations involving a delta Dirac function, such that the solution has the form
$$
f(x) = \sum_{n\ge 1} f_n \cos \left( (2n-1)x \right) \, .
$$
That is, only the odd indices have to be need to be included in the Fourier series representation of the delta Dirac function. What I tries is:
$$
\delta(x) = \frac{2}{\pi} \sum_{n\ge 1} \cos \left( (2n-1)x \right) \, , 
$$
which seems to lead to correct final results.
I am wondering whether this can be proved in a rigorous way and/or whether this is true in the first place. Any help or comment would be very helpful. Mickhausen","['real-analysis', 'fourier-series', 'fourier-analysis', 'trigonometry', 'sequences-and-series']"
2855483,Existence of an antiderivative function on an arbitrary subset of $\mathbb{R}$,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be  continuous at $x$ for every $x\in I$  where $I\subset \mathbb R$ could be arbitrary. Does there always exist a function $F:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ differentiable on $I$ and $F'(x) = f(x)$ for every $x \in I$? The definition of a primitive is naturally defined on an interval. A mathematical curiosity is to understand the difficulties that can be encountered when trying to define this notion on any part of $\mathbb{R}$. A first difficulty is to try to find a good definition of the notion of a primitive on any part of $\mathbb{R}$. That was the purpose of this thread

2855492,Finding extremals which arise from a non-linear third order ODE,"I'm trying to determine the extremals of the functional $F(x,y,y',y'') = (y')^2 + (y'')^2$. I know that in this case the first integral satisfies $$F - y' \left( F_{y'} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}F_{y''}\right)-y''F_{y''}=k$$ where $k$ is a constant. For the aforementioned functional, I can easily see that $F_{y'} = 2y'$ and that $F_{y''} = 2y''$, and furthermore $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}F_{y''}=2y'''$. If I put this into the equation satisfied by the extremal, we get
$$(y')^2 + (y'')^2 -y'(2y' - 2y''') - y''(2y'')=k$$ and it is then possible to re-write this as $$(y')^2 + (y'')^2 = 2y'y''' - k$$ I am unsure what to do next. Is there a trick that I can use to solve this nonlinear third order ODE? I tried integrating both sides between 0 and 1 (as those are the two $x$-values that the boundary conditions specify) as I can see that the functional appears on the left hand side of the equation, but the exercise I am doing is asking for the extremals which implies that I need to find $y(x)$ rather than what the stationary value of the integral is.","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus-of-variations', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'nonlinear-system']"

2855615,"After $10$ inspections with no defect, whats the prob of that number of inspection is no more than $20$?","I have a problem which I'm not sure how to solve. It goes as follows: A production line has a $5$% defective rate, and its products are inspected one by one until the first defect is found. Given that the first $10$ inspections do not find any defect, what is the probability that the number of inspections is no more than $20$? I tried the following approach: Given that this is a Bernoulli process, I thought that if there were no defective parts encountered in the first 10 inspected products, the next 10 products (till $X_{20}$) will be independent from the past, which means a new Bernoulli process of 10 trials. So, if $S$ is the sum of each $X_i$, then I could calculate its PMF with parameters $p=.05$ and $t=10$, where $t$ is the number of trials: $p_s(1) = \binom{10}{1}(0.05)(0.95)^9$ $p_s(1) = .3151$ Yet this is wrong. I'm not sure if I had to use a conditional approach (because the second round of inspection occurs in the conditional universe where there were no defects in the first $10$) so as to say that: Event A : one is defective in $11$ through $20$ Event B : none is defective in the first $10$ $P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)$ In which case: $P(A) = p_s(1) = \binom{10}{1}(0.05)(0.95)^9$ $P(B) = p_s(0) = \binom{10}{0}(0.95)^{10}$",['probability']

2855635,Proving Uniqueness of CCR Algebras,"I am currently trying to learn about CCR algebras (canonical commutation relations) and I am experiencing some confusion with the proof that the CCR algebra of a (non-degenerate, real) symplectic vector space is unique. I have been reading from chapter 6 of the following, in which the relevant result is Theorem 3: https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Prof-Geometrie/Dokumente/Publikationen/qft-alg.pdf I shall summarise the proof, and insert numbers where I have questions. Any terminology should be defined in the document linked above. Proof: Given two CCR-representations ($A_1$, $W_1$) and ($A_2$, $W_2$) of the symplectic vector space ($V$, $\omega$), we must show that the $^*$-isomorphism $\pi:\langle W_1(V)\rangle\rightarrow\langle W_2(V)\rangle$ between the $^*$-algebras $\langle W_1(V)\rangle$ and $\langle W_2(V)\rangle$ extends to an isometry between $A_1$ and $A_2$$^{(1)}$. Then the norm $\|x\|=\|\pi(x)\|_2$ is introduced on $A_1$, and it noted that $\|\pi(x)\|_2\leq \|x\|_\text{max}$, where $\|\cdot\|_\text{max}$ is defined in Lemma 9 by $$\|x\|_\text{max}=\sup\{\|x\|\text{; }\|\cdot\|\text{ is a C}^*\text{ norm on } \langle W_1(V)\rangle\}.$$ Then it is concluded that $\varphi$ extends to a $^*$-homomorphism $\overline{\langle W_1(V)\rangle}^\text{max}\rightarrow A_2$$^{(2)}$. Lemma 10 is applied to conclude that this extension is injective, and then it follows that the extension is isometric$^{(3)}$. This is pretty much where the proof finishes, barring one note about the case when $A_1=A_2$. I'll now list my questions. (1) Checking this will be sufficient because we could then do the same for the inverse $\varphi^{-1}$ to get the required map between $A_1$ and $A_2$? (2) The bound $\|\pi(x)\|_2\leq \|x\|_\text{max}$ shows that $\pi$ is continuous, so $\pi$ extends to $\overline{\langle W_1(V)\rangle}^\text{max}$ by continuity and density of $\langle W_1(V)\rangle$? (3) I really don't understand why this is sufficient. To me it seems that finishing at this point requires the completion $\overline{\langle W_1(V)\rangle}^\text{max}$ to coincide with $A_1$, but I haven't really gotten anywhere with showing this on my own. Any help/suggestions/slaps around the face because it's obvious will be greatly appreciated.","['functional-analysis', 'operator-algebras', 'mathematical-physics']"

where $\epsilon:=\frac{9ac-3b^2}{9a}=\frac{3ac-b^2}{3a}$ and $\delta:=\frac{27a^2d-b^3}{27a^2}$. Now let $G: (x,y) \mapsto (x-\frac{b}{3a}y,y)$; $G$ is an (affine) automorphism of $\mathbb{R}$. We get that: $G(p_3)=G(a(x+\frac{b}{3a}y)^3+
\epsilon xy^2+\delta y^3)= aG(x+\frac{b}{3a}y)^3+
\epsilon G(xy^2)+\delta G(y^3)=ax^3+
\epsilon (x-\frac{b}{3a}y)y^2+\delta y^3=

$\frac{\partial (Ax^5+Cx^3y^2+Dx^2y^3+Exy^4+Fy^5)}{\partial x}

According to the statement of Grothendieck-Serre duality in Hida's book Geometric Modular Forms and Elliptic Curves, there should be a canonical isomorphism $\underline{\omega}_{E/S}\cong\mathcal{Hom}_{\mathscr{O}_S}(R^1f_*\mathscr{O}_E,\mathscr{O}_S)$, and the first result on elliptic curves in this book is that $R^1f_*\mathscr{O}_E\cong\mathscr{O}_S$. It's also not clear to me whether $S$ is being assumed (locally) Noetherian, but if that's necessary for Grothendieck-Serre duality to hold, then I'm fine with assuming it. I can't find another reference with a statement of Grothendieck-Serre duality in this generality which does not use the language of derived categories (which I unfortunately don't understand). The reason I'm kind of skeptical about this is that in Hida's book, as well as in Katz-Mazur, it is said that $\underline{\omega}_{E/S}$ is invertible, so that an $\mathscr{O}_S$-basis $\omega$ for $\underline{\omega}_{E/S}$ can be found locally on $S$. If the invertible sheaf in question were really trivial then one would be able to choose a global $\mathscr{O}_S$-basis for $\underline{\omega}_{E/S}$, and there would be no reason to talk about doing so locally. Hida goes on to say that, choosing an $\mathscr{O}_S$-basis $\omega$ locally on $S$ allows one to regard $(\Omega_{E/S}^1,\omega)$ as a relative effective Cartier divisor in $E/S$, which also doesn't make complete sense to me because if we can only find $\omega$ locally, how are we getting a global section $\omega\in H^0(E,\Omega_{E/S}^1)=H^0(S,\underline{\omega}_{E/S})$ (unless $\underline{\omega}_{E/S}$ really is trivial)?","['elliptic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2855987,How to understand Cantor's diagonalization method in proving the uncountability of the real numbers?,"Cantor's diagonalization method prove that the real numbers between $0$ and $1$ are uncountable. I can not understand it. About the statement. I can 'prove' the real numbers between $0$ and $1$ is countable (I know my proof should be wrong, but I dont know where is the wrong). Proof: The real numbers between $0$ and $1$ can always be written as ""$0.$xxxx..."". If we remove the '$0.$', the number after it ""xxxx..."" is always an integer. In addition, in order to has the well-defined addition of infinite long integers, we also ask the reflection operation, i.e. the corresponding of ""$\sqrt{2}-1=0.4142...$"" is ""$...2414$"". Through this way, we may build one to one correspondence from real numbers in $(0,1)$ onto the natural numbers. Thus the real numbers in $(0,1)$ is countable. Remark: As far as I understanding, both rational numbers ( $1/3=0.333...$) and irrational numbers ($\sqrt{2}-1=0.4142...$) in the region $(0,1)$ are corresponding to natural numbers in the ways of removing the '$0.$' and reflection. Here '$0.333...$' and '$0.4142...$' are corresponding to infinite long integers '$...333$' and '$...4142$'. EDIT ： The infinite long integer has the right end is not an infinite number , because for any infinite long integer has the right end (suppose it is 'n'), we can well define 'n+1' (e.x. ""$...2414$+1""), which is bigger than 'n', thus 'n' is not an infinity value, as the infinity value should be bigger than any natural number. About Cantor's proof. Seem's that Cantor's proof can be directly used to prove that the integers are uncountably infinite by just removing ""$0.$"" from each real number of the list (though we know integers are in fact countably infinite). Remark: There are answers in Why doesn't Cantor's diagonalization work on integers? and Why Doesn't Cantor's Diagonal Argument Also Apply to Natural Numbers? It is said the main reason is integers cannot have an infinite number of digits . I can not understand this. As I show above, by remove '0.' from '$\sqrt{2}-1=0.4142...$', we can get an integer, which is infinite long. And also, integers are in fact countably infinite also means we can have infinite big integer.",['elementary-set-theory']

(If such a $k$ exists, then we can in fact take $k=K$, by splitting the variables into two infinite sets.)

Method 1: I can give this question a straight approach saying that since the probability of his saying the truth is 3/4 then the probability that it is a six is also 3/4. Method 2: If I go by a more rigorous method, let E1 be the event that the man reports a six and E be the event that it is a six. $P(E)=\frac{1}{6}$ $P(E')=\frac{5}{6}$ $P(E1|E)=\frac{3}{4}$ (When the man speaks the truth) $P(E1|E')=\frac{1}{4}.\frac{1}{5}$ (When the man speaks the false, he could say any of the remaining 5, one of which is six.

$$P(E|E1)=\frac{P(E)P(E1|E)}{P(E)P(E1|E)+P(E')P(E1|E')}$$

So the image or codomain of this linear transformation is the inner product space, while the domain of this linear transformation is the original vector space.","['linear-algebra', 'linear-transformations', 'inner-products']"

2856255,Partitioning a multiset into multisets of fixed sizes,"Say we have a multiset $S(\mathbf{d}$) where $\mathbf{d}$ is a list of $l$ numbers and the multiplicity of the $i$th element of $S$ is $d_i$. The cardinality $N$ of $S$ is $\sum d_i$. We want to partition $S$ into $m$ multisets of size $k_i$ respectively, so that $\sum k_i = \sum d_i = N$. How many ways can we do this? In my mind this is a generalization of the multinomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m}$ representing the number of ways to partition a set of $n=\sum k_i$ objects into $m$ bins of sizes $k_i$, to a sort of number like $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m}$ or $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{\mathbf{k}}$ representing the number of ways to partition a multiset of $n=\sum k_i = \sum d_i$ into $m$ bins of sizes $k_i$. There are a few special cases that are simpler to calculate: If $m=1$, then clearly $k_1 = N$ and you're choosing the whole multiset. So $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{(N)} = 1$ If $m=2$, then you only have to handle choosing $k_1$ or $k_2$ elements from a multiset, because the rest will be the other set. So, as mentioned below, you can use a generating function and $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{(k_1,k_2)}$ is equal to the coefficient of $x^{k_1}$ or $x^{k_2}$ in $\prod\limits_{i=1}^l 1 + x^2 + \cdots + x^{d_i} = \prod\limits_{i=1}^l \frac{1-x^{d_i - 1}}{1 - x}$. But then you also need to account for the fact that order doesn't matter, which I'm not sure how to do. Like in the first example below, you would find that there are $3$ ways to choose $2$ elements, but there are only $2$ ways to split the multiset because you have to choose 2 of them that are compatible. Examples Let's say that $\mathbf{d} = (2, 2)$, so $S(\mathbf{d})$ might be $\{a, a, b, b\}$. Let $k_1 = k_2 = 2$, so we need to find all the ways of splitting $S$ into two sub-multisets of size $2$. There are exactly $2$ ways of doing this: $\{\{a,a\},\{b,b\}\}$ and $\{\{a,b\},\{a,b\}\}$, so $\binom{(2,2)}{(2,2)} = 2$. Another example: $\mathbf{d} = (2,2)$, so $S(\mathbf{d})$ could be $\{a,a,b,b\}$. Let $k_1 = 1$, $k_2 = 1$, and $k_3 = 2$. There are $3$ ways of doing this: $\{\{a\},\{a\},\{b,b\}\}$, $\{\{b\},\{b\},\{a,a\}\}$, and $\{\{a\},\{b\},\{a,b\}\}$. So $\binom{(2,2)}{(1,1,2)}=3$. My Attempts I've tried to figure this out two ways. The first was to find a recurrence relation and some base cases, kind of how Stirling numbers of the second kind can be computed using the identity $S(n,k) = kS(n-1,k) + S(n-1,k-1)$. I tried to think about what happens if you already have a partition and want to add an element to the original multiset, but then you have to decide which bin that element will go into or whether or not to add a new bin. I also tried to derive it in the way that multinomial coefficients are derived, by counting the number of ways to fill the first bin, and then the second, and so on. The number of ways to choose $k_1$ elements from the multiset to put in the first bin can be computed by finding the coefficient of $x^{k_1}$ in $\prod\limits_{i=1}^l 1+x+x^2+\cdots+x^{d_i}$, which isn't explicit but it's a start. But then, depending on which elements you chose, you don't know how to adjust your multiset to reflect the remaining elements.","['combinatorics', 'multisets', 'set-partition']"

I would like to obtain a ""reasonably uniform"" asymptotic approximation for this integral in the limit of large $M$ and small $h$, specifically when $h$ goes to zero before $M$ goes to infinity.

By contrast there is a significant contribution to the integration over an interval of length on the order of $1/M$, which is much larger. Higher order Taylor approximations never see this because they just keep on assuming that $|x| \ll h/M$ and thus proceed to divide by larger and larger powers of $h$. An obvious alternative is to sacrifice accuracy in this $O(h/M)$ vicinity of $0$, for example by suppressing $h^2$ altogether, but this obviously does not achieve $o(h)$ accuracy, which is required for my application.

2856793,Reconstruction after Unitary Operator on Paley-Wiener space,"Background: According to the Sampling Theorem for Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), for any RKHS $H_{rk}$ with reproducing kernel $k(\cdot, \cdot)$, if I can find a set of points $\{t_{n}\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\{k(\cdot, t_{n}) \}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ is an orthogonal basis for the space, I can reproduce any $g \in H_{rk}$ via kernel interpolation at $\{t_{n}\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$. So now suppose I have a function $f \in PW_{\pi}$, where $PW_{\pi}$ is the Paley-Weiner space with Fourier support $[-\pi, \pi]$. I then apply a unitary operator $U$ to the function and get $g = Uf$. It is well known that $PW_{\pi}$ is a RKHS, with $\{sinc_{\pi}(t-n)\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ as both the orthogonal basis and the reproducing kernel. My Questions: 1 .Is $UPW_{\pi}$ an RKHS? 2 .If it is, is it possible to reconstruct $f$ via interpolation from the samples of $g$? If so, can we find the samples of $f$ that are required to reconstruct $f$ from the samples of $g$? My Answers: Yes. My intuition is that since open sets on $L^{2}[\mathbb{R}]$ are unit circles, and since $U$ is unitary, it is just rotating these balls, which means $UPW_{\pi} = PW_{\pi}$. I am not sure how to prove this though, or if this is even the way to do so. Yes. All we have to do is interpolate $g$ and then map it back to $f$ via $f = U^{-1}g$. So if we want to find a sample of $f$, we first find all the needed samples of $g$, interpolate $g$ via the sampling theorem, and then resample $U^{-1}g$ at the points $\{U^{-1}t_{n}\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$. These points $\{U^{-1}t_{n}\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ will be the corresponding sampling points of $f$. Any idea on how to start proving this? Apologies: My functional analysis is very weak. I am just trying to piece things together as I go, so I may be missing some fundamental concepts or parts here.

It appears to be a problem in two parts. A line, $\overline{bf}$, is tangent to arc segment $\overline{ab}$ with center $c$, and fixed at point $a$. Line $\overline{bf}$ is rotated by $6$ degrees to become line $\overline{df}$, causing the arc radius to decrease to $R$, but the arc remains fixed at point $a$ and tangent to the original arc. The center $c$ moves to point $e$ due to the decrease in radius, but remains coincident with line $\overline{ag}$. Line $\overline{fg}$ has fixed length $W$ and is equal to the starting radius of arc segment $\overline{ab}$, but not equal to the finishing radius of arc segment $\overline{ad}$.

2857008,Limit superior of a sequence of oscillating functions related to Chebyshev polynomials,"Let $n \in \mathbb N$ and consider the polynomial function $f_n \colon \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ defined by
$$f_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \binom {2n+1} {2k+1} (1 - x^2)^{n-k} x^{2k}$$
for any $x \in \mathbb R$. ( These functions are related to Chebyshev polynomials, see the update below. ) By plotting the graphs of the functions as $n$ increases, one sees that they exhibit an oscillating behavior in $[-1, 1]$. For example, here are the graphs of  $f_3, f_5, f_7$: As $n \to \infty$, it looks as though the crests of the wave describe the graph of another function. For example, here is the graph of $f_{50}$: Let $f \colon D \to \mathbb R$ be defined by
$$f(x) = \limsup_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)$$
whenever the limit superior exists and is finite. I would like to find as much information as possible about this function. So far, I have only been able to show the following ( see the update below ): $f$ is an even function, since all of the $f_n$'s are even. $0 \notin D$. Indeed, $f_n(0) = 2n + 1 \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$. $f(\pm 1) = 1$, because $f_n(\pm 1) = (-1)^n$ for any $n \in \mathbb N$. $f \left (\pm \frac {\sqrt 2} 2 \right ) = 1$. This is because:
$$f_n \left ( \pm \frac {\sqrt 2} 2 \right ) = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \binom {2n+1} {2k+1} \left ( \frac 1 2 \right )^n = (-1)^{\left \lfloor \frac n 2 \right \rfloor} 2^n \left ( \frac 1 2 \right )^n = (-1)^{\left \lfloor \frac n 2 \right \rfloor} \le 1$$
In particular, $f_{4m} \left (\pm \frac {\sqrt 2} 2 \right ) = 1$ for any $m \in \mathbb N$, so $\limsup_{n \to \infty} f_n \left ( \pm \frac {\sqrt 2} 2 \right ) = 1$. By looking at the definition of $f_n(x)$, it seems as though one should use the binomial theorem to find a better expression to work with, but I'm not sure how. What else can we say about $f$? Is it possible to find a ""simple"" expression? Thank you in advance for any reply. Update : By looking up the coefficients of the first few polynomials, I found out that they are closely related to the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. In fact, it appears that
$$f_n(\sin \alpha) = \frac {\sin ((2n+1) \alpha)}{\sin \alpha}$$
for any $\alpha \in \mathbb R \smallsetminus \pi \mathbb Z$, which immediately provides us with many other values of $f$. For instance,
$$f_n \left (\sin \frac \pi 6 \right ) = \frac{\sin \left ( (2n+1) \frac \pi 6 \right )}{\sin \frac \pi 6} \le \frac 1 {\frac 1 2} = 2$$
In particular,
$$f_{6m+1} \left (\sin \frac \pi 6 \right ) = \frac{\sin \left ( (12 m + 3) \frac \pi 6 \right )}{\sin \frac \pi 6} = \frac{\sin \left ( 2 m \pi + \frac \pi 2 \right )}{\sin \frac \pi 6} = \frac 1 {\frac 1 2} = 2$$
for any $m \in \mathbb N$, and thus $f \left (\pm \frac 1 2 \right ) = 2$. How can we get a simple expression for $f$ using this information?","['polynomials', 'limsup-and-liminf', 'chebyshev-polynomials', 'functions', 'sequences-and-series']"

My Method: $\frac{df(x)}{dx} = 5f(x)$ $df(x) = 5f(x)dx$ $\int{df(x)} = \int{5f(x)dx}$ $f(x) = 5f(x)\cdot x + C$ $f(3) = 5f(3)\cdot 3 + C$ $2 = 30 + C$ $C = -28$ $f(x) = 5f(x)\cdot x - 28$ $28 = f(x)(5x - 1)$ $f(x) = \frac{28}{5x - 1}$ Explanation: I know my answer is wrong, as it does not satisfy the condition $f'(x) = 5f(x)$, yet I am intrigued by this problem as I cannot seem to figure out what I did wrong. My answer does satisfy the condition $f(3) = 2$ and its derivative - $f'(x) = -\frac{140}{(5x - 1)^2}$ - is suggestive of some similarity to the original differential (eg numerator is multiplied by 5). Perhaps someone can enlighten me regarding where I went astray. Thank you.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus']"
