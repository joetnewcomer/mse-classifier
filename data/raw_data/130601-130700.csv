2031435,Uniqueness of Hahn-Banach extension for dense subspace,"Let $A$ be a normed space and $B\subset A$ a linear subspace with $\phi\in B^*$.
I am looking to prove the following: B is dense in $A$ iff there is a unique extension of $\phi$ to a continuous linear functional on $A$. What I thought: Hahn-Banach tells us that there does exist an extension of $\psi$ of $\phi$ such that $\|\phi\|=\|\psi\|$. Further $B$ being dense in $A$ means that each sequence in $B$ converges to an $a\in A$. How do I use these to prove the statement? Edit: $\implies$: Suppose $f,g$ are extensions of $\phi$ on $A$. Let $a\in A\backslash B$. Then $a=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}b_n$ for $b_n\in B$. This gives
$$f(a)=f(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}b_n)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(b_n)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}g(b_n)=g(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}b_n)=g(a).$$ Is this a good proof? How does the other way go?","['functional-analysis', 'normed-spaces', 'general-topology', 'linear-transformations']"

2031507,A question regarding picking balls from an urn,"Five balls are randomly chosen, without replacement,
from an urn that contains 5 red, 6 white, and
7 blue balls. Find the probability that at least one

Since there has to be at least 1 ball of each color we have $\binom{5}{1}\binom{6}{1}\binom{7}{1}$ ways of picking them. For  each combination there remains 2 balls to be picked from the remaining $15$, so $\binom{15}{2}$ ways. The sample space consists of $\binom{18}{5}$ outcomes. Or so I though, clearly I am wrong.

Alternative forms Based on an insight from an old post , for $p=7$ we use the ""negative"" case on both its numerator and denominator.

which I was able to prove and suffices for what I need to do.

2031744,"On the integral $\int_0^\infty \eta^2(i x) \,dx = \ln(1+\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3+2 \sqrt{3}})$ and its cousins","While experimenting with integrals involving the Dedekind Eta function, I came across a family of integrals which seem to follow 
a very simple pattern. With $y \in \mathbb{N}$, define:
$$A(y) = \int_0^{\infty} \eta( i x)\,\eta(i x y)\,dx.$$
The integral can be rewritten in the following infinite series forms: \begin{align}
A(y) & = \frac{12}{\pi} \sum_{(n,m) \in \mathbb{Z}^2} \frac{(-1)^{n+m}}{(6n+1)^2+y \, (6m+1)^2} \\[8pt]
& =\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{y}} \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \frac{(-1)^n}{6n+1} \, \dfrac{ \sinh \frac{\pi \sqrt{y}}{3} (6n+1)}{\cosh \frac{\pi \sqrt{y}}{2} (6n+1)} \\[8pt]
& = \frac{2}{\sqrt{y}} \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} (-1)^n \tanh^{-1} \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \operatorname{sech}(\pi \sqrt{y} (n+1/6))\right).
\end{align} Numerical computations seem to confirm that \begin{align}
A(1) & = \ln\left(1+ \sqrt{3} +\sqrt{3+2 \sqrt{3}} \right) \tag{1} \\[8pt]
A(2) & = \frac1{\sqrt{2}} \ln \left(1+ \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2+ 2 \sqrt{2}} \right) \tag{2} \\[8pt]
A(3) & = \frac1{\sqrt{3}} \ln \left( 1+ 2^{1/3} + 2^{2/3} \right) \tag{3}
\end{align} And generally, it looks like $$A(y) = \frac1{\sqrt{y}} \,\ln u \tag{4}$$
where $u$ is the root closest to $1$ from above, of a polynomial $P_y$. 
I've checked dozens of different $y$'s and made a list of those polynomials - check this pastebin link. Some are missing, e.g. I could not find $P_6$. Others seem to follow patterns of their own, for example the Heegner numbers. Here's the polynomial for $y=163$: $$\small P_{163}(u) = u^{12} + 640314 u^{10} + 1280624 u^9 + 640287 u^8 - 1280736 u^7 - 2561412 u^6 - 1280736 u^5 + 640287 u^4 + 1280624 u^3 + 640314 u^2 + 1 = 0$$ Other interesting things to look at are the behaviour of $P_y(1)$ and $P_y(-1)$, with regard to $y \pmod{24}$, and approximations to $\pi$ which follow from terminating the infinite series at its first term. However, I have got no clue how to prove it. What would be a way to prove $(4)$? What can be said about the polynomials $P_y$?
  Also, can you help me find $P_6$, or other missing polynomials from my list? Edit. Finally, I was able to produce a closed form for this integral thanks to @DaveHuff's hints. The idea is to rewrite the infinite series as
 $$A(y) = \frac2{\sqrt{y}} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \tanh^{-1}\left( \dfrac{\cos \frac{\pi}{6} (2n+1)}{\cosh \frac{\pi \sqrt{y}}{6} (2n+1)}\right),$$
and then, using $\displaystyle \,\,\,\tanh^{-1}x = \frac12 \ln \left( \frac{1+x}{1-x} \right),$ proceed to factorize the summand and obtain 
$$\sqrt{y} \,A(y) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \ln \left( \dfrac{(1-e^{5 \pi i n/6-\pi n\sqrt{y}/6})(1-e^{-5 \pi i n/6-\pi n\sqrt{y}/6})}{(1-e^{ \pi i n/6-\pi n\sqrt{y}/6})(1-e^{-\pi i n/6-\pi n\sqrt{y}/6})} \right),$$ which means: 
$$A(y) = \frac1{\sqrt{y}} \,\ln \left( \dfrac{\eta\left(\frac{i \sqrt{y}+5}{12}\right)\eta\left(\frac{i \sqrt{y}-5}{12}\right)}{\eta\left(\frac{i \sqrt{y}+1}{12}\right)\eta\left(\frac{i \sqrt{y}-1}{12}\right)}\right).$$ I still don't know enough eta quotient theory, so I don't know how to show that this eta quotient is in fact algebraic for every natural $y$ (let alone bring it to the implicit form in @TitoPiezasIII 's answer), but this is still good progress.","['closed-form', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'modular-forms', 'sequences-and-series']"

One possibility (but by far not the only one) is to have each antichain consist of all sets of the same cardinality. Also for the set of all subsets of $\mathbb N$ that are either finite or cofinite, it's not hard to define such a partition; partition the finite sets according to their cardinality, and the cofinite sets according to the cardinality of the complement. Of course such simple strategies won't work any more with the full $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)$. Indeed, I have no idea how one would either define such a partition, or prove that there doesn't exist one.

2032038,Is it possible to use polynomial interpolation to show that $\cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!}$?,"Several months ago, I discovered that one can make use a system of linear equations to obtain a polynomial that approaches certain functions . And I know these is the series representation for: $$\displaystyle \cos(x) = 1 - {x^{2} \over 2!} + {x^{4} \over 4!} - \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!}$$ So I decided to test this and try to obtain this series with the bakground I learned above. So I did the following: I'd need a systems of equations in the following form: $$\begin{cases}
 a_1 x_1+a_0=\cos(x_1) \\
 a_1 x_2+a_0=\cos(x_2) \\
\end{cases}$$ $$\begin{cases}
 a_2 x^2_1+a_1 x_1+a_0=\cos(x_1) \\
 a_2 x^2_2+a_1 x_2+a_0=\cos(x_2) \\
 a_2 x^2_3+a_1 x_3+a_0=\cos(x_3) \\
\end{cases}$$ $$\begin{cases}
 a_3 x^3_1+a_2 x_1^2+a_1 x_1+a_0=\cos(x_1) \\
 a_3 x^3_2+a_2 x^2_2+a_1 x_2+a_0=\cos(x_2) \\
 a_3 x^3_3+a_2 x^2_3+a_1 x_3+a_0=\cos(x_3) \\
 a_3 x^3_4+a_2 x^2_4+a_1 x_4+a_0=\cos(x_4)\\
\end{cases}$$ So, find a solution for $a_n$ should give me the coefficients of a polynomial that approaches the $\cos(x)$ at $x_n$. And hence, I did this: $$\begin{cases}
 a_0+\frac{\pi  a_1}{4}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
 a_0+\frac{\pi  a_1}{2}=0 \\
\end{cases}$$ $$\begin{cases}
 a_0+\frac{\pi  a_1}{4}+\frac{\pi ^2 a_2}{16}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\

 a_0+\frac{3 \pi  a_1}{4}+\frac{9 \pi ^2 a_2}{16}=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\

 a_0+\frac{\pi  a_1}{4}+\frac{\pi ^2 a_2}{16}+\frac{\pi ^3 a_3}{64}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
 a_0+\frac{\pi  a_1}{2}+\frac{\pi ^2 a_2}{4}+\frac{\pi ^3 a_3}{8}=0 \\

\end{array}$$ My thinking is that as we put more equations in the system for more values of $\cos$, it will give a polynomial that better approaches $\cos$. And as I put more equations with more values for cosine at the system, the solutions were: $$\begin{array}{cc}

2032209,Understanding why conditional probability is defined the way it is.,Just moments ago I stumbled upon the definition of conditional probability and I'm experiencing some difficulties in acquiring an intuitive understanding of why it's defined the way it is. $$P(E|F)= \dfrac{P(E \cap F)}{P(F)}$$ I'm more familiar with taking into consideration the amount of outcomes of interest and dividing that amount by the amount of outcomes in the sample space. I don't know how to interpret the logic behind conditional probability. I understand that $P(F)$ is the probability that the event which is known to have occured occurs. So I suppose that it can be calulated the way I am familiar with. Presumably the same goes for $P(E \cap F)$ by using the Inclusionâ€“exclusion principle. But why one is divided by the other I cannot fathom. Why is it defined this way? How does one make sense of it.,"['probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Following the solution suggested in the above link, I considered the following approach. Let $h_{n}$ be an arbitrary sequence of real numbers descending to $0$. For an arbitrary $\delta >0$, we may write $h_{n}=t_{n}/m_{n}$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $m_{n}\in\mathbb{N}$ and $|t_{n}-1|<\delta$. Hence, for sufficiently large $n$, $$
\begin{aligned}
\left|\frac{\varphi\left(\frac{t_{n}}{m_{n}}\right)-1}{\frac{t_{n}}{m_{n}}}-ia\right|&=\frac{1}{t_{n}}\left|m_{n}\left(\varphi\left(\frac{t_{n}}{m_{n}}\right)-1\right)-iat_{n}\right|\\

2032366,On a Clarkson-like inequality in $L^p$,"I'm currently reading the book ""Topics in Almost Everywhere Convergence"" by A. Garsia. At a certain point, he claims the validity of the following inequality, for $f, g \in L^p(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$, $\mu$ being a probability measure: \begin{equation*}
\|  f - g \|^{p}_{p} \leq C_{p} \left[ \| f \|_{p}^{p} + \| g \|_{p}^{p} -2 \left\| \frac{f + g}{2} \right\|_{p}^{p} \right]^{\min \{1, p/2\}}
\end{equation*} for any $p>1$, where $C_p$ is a constant and $f, g$ are on the unit ball. If $p\geq 2$, I see that this is Clarkson's inequality. However, for $1 < p <2$, it doesn't seem to be that simple. What bugs me the most is that this result is accompanied by the following footnote: This can be established by expressing $$|f|^p + |g|^p - 2 \left| \frac{f + g}{2} \right|^p$$ as an integral involving the second derivative of $|x|^p$. The constant $C_p$ tends to infinity as $p \to 1$. The above suggests that there is some unified approach for all values of $p$ and possibly elementary.

I want to show the $B_n$ are pairwise disjoint. That is, for any $i \ne j$, without loss of generality $i>j$,
\begin{align*}
B_i\cap B_j

 \in A_j$, but $x \notin \bigcup_{n=1}^{i=1} A_n$ and $x \notin
 \bigcup_{n=1}^{j-1} A_n$, i.e.  $x \notin A_n$, $n=1,\ldots,i-1$ and
   $x \notin A_n$, $n=1,\ldots,j-1$. Since $i>j$, the last statement is
   redundant. Thus $x \in A_i$ and $x \in A_j$, but $x \notin A_n$,
   $i=1,\ldots,i-1$. But since $j<i$, the statement $i=1,\ldots,i-1$
   implies $x \notin A_j$, which is a contradiction. However I don't want to prove this in a paragraph of words -- I want to show algebraically that the intersection must equal the empty set using basic set operations (properties of the set difference, unions and intersections, etc.) to manipulate the above equations. But I get stuck along the way and it's not obvious what rules I should use next to manipulate the above equations. Anyone see any neat tricks to use?

It seems that if I want to show that $-K_X$ is nef, It is enough to show that $-K_X.D_i=D_i^2+2\geq 0$, i.e:$a_i\geq -2$ for each $i$, I wonder whether there exists similar criterion for general divisor $D$ without computing intersection numbers for each irreducible curves on $X$ but with certain class(with finitely many members) of irreducible class of curves on $X$. The example I have in my mind is a toric surface $X$. Since all the divisors are linear equivalent to the boundary divisors, so one just need to verify the Criterion on boundary divisors. Note that $(X,-K_X=D)$ is called an anti canonical pair or Looijenga pair. It seems that there is a statement saying that any Looijenga pair has a toric model. I wonder whether we can obtain some ""convenient"" criterion from this connections. Question 2: Let $X$ be a rational surface with $K_X^2>0$, i.e $X$ is a rational surface with big anti canonical class. I wonder whether in this setting, we have ""convenient"" criterion for a divisor being nef. Note that one is able to show that $X$ is actually a Mori-dream space(they called rational Mori dream surface).And Mori-dream space is natural generalization of toric varieties.

I'll have to write a bunch of things because of the context, but the main question is easy, just look at the image... Now, the book says: Consider $f$ in the annulus $f:A(a,p_1,p_2)\to\mathbb{C}$, fix a point $z$ in $A(a,p_1,p_2)$ and let $r_1,r_2$ be two real numbers satisfying $p_1<r_1<|z|<r_2<p_2$. Look to the closed annulus $\overline{A}(a,r_1,r_2)$. Its boundary is formed by the circles $\gamma_1=\{|w-a|r_1\}$ and $\gamma_2=\{|w-a|=r_2\}$. Lets use the Cauchy Integral Formula to describe $f$ around $z$. Initially, observe that $g(w) = \frac{f(w)}{w-z}$ is holomorph in the ring $A(a,p_1,p_2)$ except in the point $z$. Therefore, we'll isolate $z$ considering the disk with it in the center, $D(z,\tau)$ such that $\overline{D}(z,\tau)\subset A(a,r_1,r_2)$ and the boundary is the circle $\gamma$, which we oriented counterwise. By the Cauchy Integral Formula we have: $$f(z) = \frac{1}{2i\pi}\int_{\lambda}\frac{f(w)}{w-z}\ dw$$ Consider now the region $V$ formed by the points interior to $\gamma_2$, exterior to $\gamma_1$ and $\lambda$. Its boundary $\partial V$ is formed by the three Jordan curves $\lambda, \gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$. By considering the compatible orientation, we have: $\partial V = \gamma_1^{-}\cup \lambda^{-}\cup \gamma_2$. Since $g(w) = \frac{f(w)}{w-z}$ is holomorph in an open wich contains $V$ and $\partial V$, the Cauchy Theorem guarantees us that: $$0 = \int_{\partial V}g(w)\ dw = \int_{\partial V}\frac{f(w)}{w-z}\ dw$$ Is the integral above $0$ because I can integrate like in the image I drawn? If not, how should I break up the annulus in order for the integral to be $0$ and be represented as the sum of the integrals of each circle?","['laurent-series', 'complex-analysis', 'power-series']"

Let us write $A=PDP^{-1}$ where $D$ is a diagonal matrix with entries in $\{-i,i\}$ and $P$ is complex and non-singular. Since the trace of $A$ is real, there must be the same number of $i$ and $-i$ on $D$'s diagonal. Although interesting, this doesn't give a very explicit description of $A$.

2033506,A method for evaluating sums/discrete functions by assuming they can be made continuous and differentiable?,"Suppose I had a function that satisfied the property $f(x)=f(x-1)+g(x)$.  For any $x\in\mathbb N$, it is easy enough to see that this boils down to the statement $$f(x)=f(0)+\sum_{k=1}^xg(k)$$ If we return to our functional equation and differentiate it $n$ times, we get $$f^{(n)}(x)=f^{(n)}(x-1)+g^{(n)}(x)$$ Once again, for any $x\in\mathbb N$, we have $$f^{(n)}(x)=f^{(n)}(0)+\sum_{k=1}^xg^{(n)}(k)$$ One could then integrate both sides.  For example, this asserts that $$\sum_{k=1}^xg(k)=xf'(0)+\int_0^x\sum_{k=1}^tg'(k)dt$$ If the sum inside the intagral is generalized to any upper bound. How would I justify this for discrete functions? An example of this is letting $f_p(x)=\sum_{k=1}^xk^p$, as it seems to follow the above result.  We can see from the above that $$f_p(x)=a_px+p\int_0^xf_{p-1}(t)dt$$ $$a_p=1-p\int_0^1f_{p-1}(t)dt$$ which appears to be a true recursive formula.

2033992,What conditions on a map of schemes guarantee that pullback of global sections is injective?,"Consider a morphism of schemes $f: X \rightarrow Y$. What conditions on $f, X, Y$ are sufficient to guarantee that $H^0(Y, \mathscr{F}) \rightarrow H^0(X, f^* \mathscr{F})$ is injective for All $\mathscr{O}_Y$ modules $\mathscr{F}$? All (quasi-)coherent $\mathscr{O}_Y$ modules $\mathscr{F}$? A necessary condition for the first and second questions is that $f$ is surjective on closed points, since if $y \in Y \setminus f(X)$ is closed, we can take $\mathscr{F} = i_* \mathscr{O}_{k(y)}$. Then for any $x \in X$, $(f^* \mathscr{F})_x \simeq \mathscr{F}_{f(x)} = 0$, so $f^* \mathscr{F} = 0$. But $H^0(Y, \mathscr{F}) = k(y) \neq 0$. In the case that $\mathscr{F}$ is a locally free sheaf, $f$ is quasi-compact and $Y$ is reduced, this condition is also sufficient (and in fact, we only need $f$ to be dominant). To see this, the map $H^0(Y, \mathscr{F}) \rightarrow H^0(X, f^* \mathscr{F})$ is the global part of the canonical map of sheaves $\mathscr{F} \rightarrow f_* f^* \mathscr{F}$. Let $U$ be an affine open set such that $\mathscr{F}|_U \simeq \mathscr{O}_U$. Then on $U$, the canonical map is identified with the structure map $\mathscr{O}_U \rightarrow f_* \mathscr{O}_{f^{-1}(U)}$, which is injective since $\mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow f_* \mathscr{O}_X$ is injective under these hypotheses. Is this condition also sufficient for the first two questions? The affine version of the question is: Which extensions of rings $A \subseteq B$ have the property that for any (resp. any finitely presented) $A$-module $M$, the map $M \rightarrow M \otimes_A B$ is injective? Since this always holds when $M$ is flat (which implies locally free in the finitely presented case), it seems natural to guess that we should require $B$ to be faithfully flat over $A$. However, I cannot find a way to use this property or a counterexample when $\mathrm{Spec} \ B \rightarrow \mathrm{Spec} \ A$ is surjective but $B$ is not flat over $A$. EDIT I found a partial answer to this question in EGA IV-2 2.2.8: if $X, Y$ are arbitrary and $f$ is faithfully flat, then the canonical morphism is injective for all sheaves of quasi-coherent modules. This goes by identifying the global sections of $\mathscr{F}$ with morphisms $u: \mathscr{O}_Y \rightarrow \mathscr{F}$ and noting that the canonical map agrees with the map $u \rightarrow f^*(u)$. Faithful flatness says that if $f^*(u) = 0$ then $u = 0$. Actually, Remark 2.2.9 says that the $\mathscr{O}_Y$-module $\mathscr{F}$ does not need to be quasi-coherent for this proof to go through, although the proof is unclear to me. Also, Alex provided a counterexample in the case that $f$ is surjective but not flat. So now, the remaining question is: If $X$ and $Y$ are ""nice enough"", does $f$ really have to be flat? EDIT 2 Here is an easy counterexample when $X, Y$ are both smooth but not integral. Let $Y = \mathbf{A}^1$, $X = (\mathbf{A}^1 \setminus \{0\}) \sqcup \{0\}$, and $f$ the map given on rings by $k[x] \rightarrow k \times k[x,x^{-1}]$, $x \mapsto (0, x)$. Then let $\mathscr{F}$ be the coherent sheaf corresponding to the module $k[x]/x^2$. $f^* \mathscr{F} \simeq k$, since $(0,1) = x^2 * x^{-2}$ is killed. Then, $x$ maps to $0$ in the global section map.","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

I figured it didn't work probably because i.i.d. condition was not used. 2nd Try : $$\begin{align}P(|X_n|/n > \epsilon \text{ i.o.}) &= \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty}P(\bigcup_{n=m}^\infty |X_n|/n > \epsilon) \\ &= \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty}1-P((\bigcup_{n=m}^\infty |X_n|/n > \epsilon)^c) \\ &=\lim_{m \rightarrow \infty}1-\prod_{n=m}^\infty P(|X_1|/n \le \epsilon)\end{align}$$ Stuck again.","['probability-theory', 'convergence-divergence']"
2034198,"$(1+2+3+....+n)+k= 2013$, find $n-k$","If for some natural number '$n$' ; $(1+2+3+..+n) + k = 2013$ where $k$ is
  one of the numbers $1,2,3,.....,n$, then find the value of $n-k$. This question seems to be based on hit and trial method since we only have one equation and two variables; I got the answer using hit and trial pretty quickly, but I am sure there has to be a better approach to this question. $$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}  + k = 2013$$ is the only equation I am able to develop and also using the fact that $k$ is less than or equal to n , I got that $n> 62$. Beyond this, I have no idea how to further proceed with this question. Help me out.","['sequences-and-series', 'elementary-number-theory']"
