469147,Formulating a differential equation,"A particle is moving with unit speed. Its angular speed is given by this equation: $$ \frac{d\phi}{ds}=\frac{3\sin^2(\phi - \alpha)-2}{r\sin(\phi - \alpha)} $$ where $\phi$ is the angle representing the particle's direction of movement , $\alpha$ and $r$ are the standard angle and distance from the origin of the particle's position in polar coordinates. I don't know how to, at least, express the differential equation of the path the particle takes, so if someone can help, or, if it's not even possible to formulate it, to give some hints to why it is impossible... Here, $ds$ is the arc length satisfying $$ ds=\sqrt{dr^2+r^2 \, d\alpha^2} $$ which basically says that the particle is moving with unit speed.

469200,Is every set in a separable metric space the union of a perfect set and a set that is at most countable?,"I'm reading Baby Rudin and exercise 28 of chapter 2 reads ""Prove that every closed set in a separable metric space is the union of a (possibly empty) perfect set and a set which is at most countable.""
I don't understand why the set must be closed in order for this to be true.  My proof is as follows, and I don't make any reference to the closedness of the set: Let $E$ be a set in a separable metric space.  Let $B$ be a countable base of that metric space.  Let $P$ be the set of condensation points of $E$.  I claim that $P$ is perfect and $E-P$ is at most countable. If $p$ is a limit point of $P$, then every neighborhood of $p$ includes at least one point $q$ of P.  For a neighborhood $N_{p}$ of $p$, choose a neighborhood $N_{q} \subset N_{p}$ of $q$.  Since $q$ is a condensation point of $E$, uncountably many points of $E$ are in $N_{q}$, and thus in $N_{p}$.  So $p\in P$ and $P$ is closed. If $p \in P$, then $p$ is a condensation point of $E$, so every neighborhood $N_{p}$ of $p$ must include uncountably many points of $E$.  If $p$ is not a limit point of $P$, then there exists a neighborhood $N_{p}$ of $p$ such that $N_p$ includes no condensation points of $E$ except for $p$.  This means that every point $q\in N_{p}-\{p\}$ must have a neighborhood $N_{q}$ that does not have uncountably many points of $E$.  For each $b_{k}\in B \cap \mathscr{P}(N_{p})$, choose such a neighborhood $N_{q_{k}} \supset b_{k}$ of some point $q\in N_{p}-\{p\}$.  Now $\{N_{q_{k}}\}$ covers $N_{p}$, and $\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}N_{q_{k}}\supset N_{p}$ has at most countably many points of $E$, for it is a union of countably many sets that have at most countably many points of $E$.  This contradicts the assumption that $p\in P$.  So $P$ is perfect. Let $S=E-P$. There are no condensation points in $S$.  So there exists an open cover $\{N_s\}$, where each $N_s$ is a neighborhood of $s \in S$ with at most countably many elements of $S$. For each $b_{k}\in B \cap \mathscr{P}(S)$, choose such a neighborhood $N_{s_{k}} \supset b_{k}$ of some point $s\in S$.  Then we have a countable subcover $\{N_{p_{k}}\}$ of $S$. As $N_{p_{k}} \cap S$ is at most countable for all $k$, $S$ must be at most countable. So what am I doing wrong?  Or is Rudin's assumption of closedness extraneous?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'real-analysis']"

I tried to consider $ g(z) = f(\sqrt{z}) $ ($ \sqrt{z} $ is a principal branch), which is bounded everywhere, but $ \sqrt{z} $ is not entire (it is not even defined on $ [0; +\infty)\ ) $ and therefore $ g(z) $ is not entire.

469243,A help to understand the generalized version of the associative law of union,"While I was looking for a better understanding of the the concept of families (which is not yet entirely clear) in the Halmos book, I found me with this: Let $\left\{ I_j \right\}$ be a family of sets with domain $J$; write $K = \bigcup_j I_j$ and let $\left\{ A_k \right\}$ be a family of sets with domain $K$. It is not difficult to prove that: $$\bigcup_k A_k = \bigcup_{j\in J} \bigg( \, \bigcup_ {i\in I_j}A_i\, \bigg) $$ So, I have two question about this: First: Is the next proof correct? $$\bigcup_k A_k = \bigcup_{j\in J} \bigg( \, \bigcup_ {i\in I_j}A_i\, \bigg) $$ ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $z\in \bigcup_k A_k $. Then there is some $k\in K$ such that $z\in A_k$. But since  $K = \bigcup_j I_j$, $k\in K$ means  $k\in I_j$ for at least one $j\in J$. So, $z\in A_k$ for some $k\in I_j$, i.e., $z\in \bigcup_{k\in I_j} A_k$; for at least one $j\in J$. So then, $z\in \bigcup_{k\in I_j} A_k$ for some $j\in J$, i.e., $z\in \bigcup_{j\in J} \big( \, \bigcup_ {k\in I_j}A_k\, \big).$ ($\Leftarrow$) Now suppose $z \in \bigcup_{j\in J} \big( \, \bigcup_ {i\in I_j}A_i\, \big)$. Then there is some $j\in J$ such that $z \in \bigcup_ {i\in I_j}A_i$. For $z \in \bigcup_ {i\in I_j}A_i$ in turn there is an $i\in I_j$ such that $z\in A_i$. Let's define the set $K := \bigcup_j I_j$ so clearly $i \in K$. Then there exists an $i \in K$ such that $z\in A_i$, so $z\in \bigcup_{i\in k} A_i$. $\;\;\; \Box$ And second: At the end of the paragraph the author says: ""This is the generalized version of the associative law of union"". But I cannot see how that generalized the associative law. Could somebody explain me the reason for which it is the generalized form, if it is not too much trouble, please?

469253,Visual intuition partial/directional derivative,"I've had some trouble with the (visual) intuition behind the directional derivatives so I decided to take a step back and look up the visual intuition behind partial derivatives, which I think I do understand. See picture below As I understood it, we basically have the purple paraboloid (?) which is a function of (x,y) and then we have the gray plane which is the plane in the direction of the x-axis. If you intersect the 2 planes I would say you get a parabola. If you have a certain point specified on the paraboloid, you can find its partial derivative in the direction of x. The way I draw the connection to a directional derivative is just by saying that you can tilt the gray plane in any direction and find the derivative. Is this correct, and if not, what's wrong?","['multivariable-calculus', 'intuition']"
469256,A submodule of a free module is torsion-free?,"I am studying for a comprehensive exam and looking at a large bank of problems.  One problem has six statements about module and asks for a a proof or a counter-example of the statements.  I am able to solve all except two related to torsion .  Assume that $R$ is an integral domain and the modules below are $R$ -modules.  So an element $m \in M$ is torsion if there is an $r \in R-0$ s.t. $rm=0$ . A submodule of a free module is torsion-free. A submodule of a torsion module is a torsion module. For #1, I know that a submodule of a free module is not necessarily free and I know that a free module is torsion-free but I can't put these to use to find a counterexample.  For #2, this seems logical but again I am unable to provide a proof.  By the way, to be clear a torsion module has only torsion elements.

469263,The unsolved mathematical light beam problem,"I have the following problem:
Imagine that you have a sphere sitting at the interface of two media(like water and oil). And the position(the heigth) of the interface to the center of the sphere is fixed and known(I drew a picture for two different situations). Now think about this: A beam of light (parallel rays) that enclose an angle alpha to the interface enters (the direction is supposed to be: they first enter the lower medium and then go to the upper one) hits this interface with the sphere. Now the question is: Can we find an analytical expression for the maximum area of the sphere perpendicular to the direction of the rays that is defined by the rays that enter the sphere without going first into the other medium? If this is unclear look at the picture: In situation 1 I drew 2 rays (of the infinitely many that enter at this angle) that fulfill the condition that they first hit the sphere without going in the upper medium. Now especially the left one is crucial since if I had chosen one that was even more slightly shifted to the left side, this one would have been in the upper medium, so no longer a reasonable candidate. The right one is not a restriction. The right picture is poorly drawn, since I wanted to have one, where both rays restrict the accessible area. But I think you have the idea now, but what do I mean by area? I am looking for the biggest area(=PROJECTION OF THE SURFACE AREA of points that fulfill this on a plane)
 perpendicular to the direction of the rays inside the sphere, that consists of rays that enter the sphere and fulfill the property above . So in the first picture this would probably the area going through the center and ""somewhat enclosed by the two arrays"" and in the second part, this one should be the ""imaginary interface"" inside the sphere.

469296,Let $F= \Bbb{Q}(\zeta_9)$ with $\zeta_9 = e^{\frac{2i\pi}{9}}$. Find the Galois group and the intermediate fields.,"Let $F= \Bbb{Q}(\zeta_9)$ with $\zeta_9 = e^{\frac{2i\pi}{9}}$ . a) What is the Galois group of $F$ over $\Bbb{Q}$ ? b) Find all intermediate fields between $\Bbb{Q}$ and $F$ . (Write each in the form $\Bbb{Q}(\alpha)$ for some specific $\alpha \in F$ .) c) For each intermediate field $E$ above, give the Galois group of $E$ over $\Bbb{Q}$ . a) Since $\Bbb{Q}(\zeta_9)$ is the splitting field of a cyclotomic polynomial, $Gal(F/\Bbb{Q})=\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9$ . b) Since $Gal(F/\Bbb{Q})=\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9$ , we need to find the subgroups of $\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9$ . But $|\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9|=6$ and there are only 2 groups of order 6 up to isomorphism: $\Bbb{Z}_6$ and $D_6$ . Since $\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9$ is abelian, we know that $\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9 \cong \Bbb{Z}_6$ . So we can use either of these diagrams, since they are both isomorphic or Where $\langle 4 \rangle = \{1, 4, 7\}$ and $\langle 8 \rangle \{1, 8\}$ . So the corresponding diagram for the intermediate fields is We need to find $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , where $[\Bbb{Q}(\alpha):\Bbb{Q}]=2$ and $[\Bbb{Q}(\beta):\Bbb{Q}]=3$ . We know that $(\zeta^3_9)^3 = 1 \implies (\zeta^3_9)^9-1=0$ . So the minimal polynomial of $\zeta^3_9$ divides $x^3-1$ . We know that $x^3-1=\Phi_1(x)\Phi_3(x)=(x-1)(x^2+x+1)$ , where $\Phi_k(x)$ is the kth cyclotomic polynomial. Since $1 \in \Bbb{Q}$ , we only need to check if $x^2+x+1$ is reducible over $\Bbb{Q}$ . But since it is a cyclotomic polynomial, it must be. So the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_9^3$ over $\Bbb{Q}$ has degree $2 \implies \alpha=\zeta^3_9$ . Now we need to find $\beta$ . Using Gerry Myerson's answer , we choose $\zeta_9 \in \Bbb{Q}(\zeta_9)$ . Since we are looking at a the Galois group of degree $3$ , we need to find a $\sigma$ such that $\sigma^3(\zeta_9 
)=\zeta_9$ . So we can choose $\sigma(\zeta_9)=\zeta_9^4$ . Now we need to find the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7$ . We see that $$(\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7)^3 = 9\zeta_9^3 + 9\zeta_9^6 + 9$$ But $$\cos(6\pi/9) + i\sin(6\pi/9) + \cos(12\pi/9) + i\sin(12\pi/9)$$ $$= 2\cos(6\pi/9) = 2\cos(2\pi/3)=2(-1/2) = -1$$ since $2\pi6/9 - 2\pi = -6\pi/9$ . It follows that $(\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7)^3 = 9(-1+1)=0$ . So we know that the min polynomial for $\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7$ must divide $x^3$ . So we need to check if $(\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7)^2=0$ . We see that $(\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7)^2 = 3\zeta_2^7 + 3\zeta_9^5 + 3\zeta_9^8$ . But we can see from the unit circle, that the sum of the three vectors ends up $50^{\circ}$ above the horizontal axis; so it is not zero $\implies$ the minimal polynomial for $\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7$ is of degree $3$ $\implies$ $\zeta_9 + \zeta_9^4 + \zeta_9^7$ is a possible choice for $\beta$ . c) The Galois group of $\Bbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is isomorphic to $\Bbb{Z}_3$ , and that of $\Bbb{Q}(\beta)$ is isomorphic to $\Bbb{Z}_2$ . I have two questions: Is my answer correct? For part b), we know that $\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9 \cong \Bbb{Z}_6$ , so finding the lattice of the subgroups is easy. But what if it was not isomorphic to a cyclic group? Would it be ok to find only $1$ subgroup for each possible order, or do we need to find all subgroups of a certain order? For example, we know that $\Bbb{Z}^{\times}_9$ has subgroups of orders $2$ and $3$ . So after finding $\langle 4 \rangle$ of order $3$ , and $\langle 8 \rangle$ of order $2$ , can I just stop? Or do I need to search for more groups of orders $2$ and $3$ ? The reason why I'm asking this is because we know that for any cyclic group, there is at most 1 subgroup of a given order. So we can just stop when we find $\Bbb{Z}_2$ and $\Bbb{Z}_3$ in $\Bbb{Z}_6$ . But we can't guarantee that with other groups, right?

469374,The Laurent series of the digamma function at the negative integers,"To find the Laurent series of  $\psi(z)$ at  $z= 0$, I would first find the Taylor series of $\psi(z+1)$ at $z=0$ and then use the functional equation of the digamma function. Specifically, $$\begin{align} \psi(z + 1) = \frac{1}{z} + \psi(z) &= \psi(1) + \psi'(1)z + \mathcal{O}(z^{2}) \\ &= -\gamma + \zeta(2) + \mathcal{O}(z^{2}) \\ &= -\gamma + \frac{\pi^{2}}{6}z + \mathcal{O}(z^{2}) \end{align}$$ which implies $$ \psi(z) = -\frac{1}{z} - \gamma + \frac{\pi^{2}}{6} z + \mathcal{O}(z^{2}).$$ But I'm having trouble finding the Laurent series of $\psi(z)$ at the negative integers. Since $\psi(z)$ has simple poles at the negative integers with residue $-1$, I know that the first term of the series must be $ \displaystyle\frac{-1}{z+n}$. But I would like to determine more terms in the series. EDIT : The series appears to be $$\begin{align} \psi(z) &= - \frac{1}{z+n} + (H_{n} - \gamma)+ \Big( H_{n}^{(2)} + \zeta(2) \Big) (z+n) + \Big( H_{n}^{(3)} - \zeta(3) \Big) (z+n)^{2} \\ &+  \Big( H_{n}^{(4)} + \zeta(4) \Big) (z+n)^{3}  + \Big( H_{n}^{(5)} - \zeta(5) \Big) (z+n)^{4} + \ldots \end{align}$$ SECOND EDIT : We can find the constant term by evaluating $\lim_{z \to -n} \Big( \psi(z) + \frac{1}{z+n} \Big)$. Since $$ \begin{align} &\psi(z) + \frac{1}{z+n} \\ &= \psi(z+1) - \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z+n} \\ &= \psi(z+2) - \frac{1}{z+1} - \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z+n} \\ &= \ ... \ = \psi(z+n+1) - \frac{1}{z+n} - \frac{1}{z+n-1} - \ldots - \frac{1}{z+1} - \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z+n}, \end{align}$$ we have $$ \lim_{z \to -n} \Big( \psi(z) + \frac{1}{z+n} \Big) = \psi(1) + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \ldots + \frac{1}{n} = \psi(1) + H_{n} = H_{n} - \gamma.$$ Similarly, we can find the coefficient of the $(z+n)$ term by evaluating $ \lim_{z \to -n} \frac{\psi(z) + \frac{1}{z+n} - H_{n} + \gamma}{z+n}.$ Since $$ \psi_{1}(z) = \psi_{1}(z+n+1) + \frac{1}{(z+n)^{2}} + \frac{1}{(z+n-1)^{2}} +  \ldots + \frac{1}{z^2}, $$ we have $$ \lim_{z \to -n} \frac{\psi(z) + \frac{1}{z+n} - H_{n} + \gamma}{z+n} = \lim_{z \to -n} \Big(\psi_{1}(z) - \frac{1}{(z+n)^{2}} \Big) = \psi_{1}(1) + H_{n}^{(2)} =  H_{n}^{(2)} + \zeta(2) .$$ And we can find the coefficient of $(z+n)^{2}$ by evaluating $ \lim_{z \to -n} \frac{\psi(z) + \frac{1}{z+n} - H_{n} + \gamma -\big( H_{n}^{(2)} + \zeta(2) \big) (z+n)}{(z+n)^{2}} . $ Since $$\psi_{2}(z) = \psi_{2} (z+n+1) - \frac{2}{(z+n)^{3}} - \frac{2}{(z+n-1)^{3}} - \ldots - \frac{2}{z^{3}},$$ we have $\begin{align} \lim_{z \to -n} \frac{\psi(z) + \frac{1}{z+n} - H_{n} + \gamma -\big( H_{n}^{(2)} + \zeta(2) \big) (z+n)}{(z+n)^{2}} &= \lim_{z \to -n} \frac{\psi_{1}(x) - \frac{1}{(z+n)^{2}} -H_{n}^{(2)} - \zeta(2)}{2(z+n)} \\ &= \lim_{z \to -n} \frac{\psi_{2}(x) + \frac{2}{(z+n)^{3}}}{2} \\ &= \frac{1}{2} \Big( \psi_{2}(1) + 2 H_{n}^{(3)} \Big) \\ &= H_{n}^{(3)} - \zeta(3). \end{align}$ $ $

The exam is in multivariable calculus and I took the classes 6 years ago so I am very rusty. Will ask a bunch of questions over the following weeks and I love you all for helping me. Translating the question from Swedish, sorry if I'm not using the right terminology. Question: Let $S$ be the surface $x^2+y^2=1 ; 0 \le z \le 2;$ oriented so that the normal points from the z-axis. Calculate: $$\iint\limits_S F\cdot dS;F(x,y,z)=xy^2i+x^2yj+zk;$$ Answer: The teacher starts out by adding a bottom $B$ and top $T$ to the cylinder, closing the surface. $$\iint\limits_{S+B+T} F\cdot dS = \iiint\limits_V \nabla F dV=\iint\limits_{x^2+y^2\le1}\int_0^2(y^2+x^2+1) dzdxdy=[polar]=...=3\pi$$ Now it's time to subtract $B$ and $T$ again. The teacher puts up the following two equations: $$\iint\limits_B F\cdot dS=\iint\limits_{x^2+y^2\le1}F(x,y,0)\cdot (0,0,-1)dxdy= 0$$
and
$$\iint\limits_T F\cdot dS=\iint\limits_{x^2+y^2\le1}F(x,y,2)\cdot (0,0,1)dxdy= 2\pi$$ I guess he's using the general Stokes (edit: this is wrong)
$$\int\limits_CF\cdot dS=\iint\limits_S \nabla F\cdot NdS$$ My questions are: If he is using that formula, where's the $\nabla$ disappearing? Why are the normal vectors chosen in that particular way?

469799,"A rational ""fifth root"" of the scalar matrix $2I$","I am working on the following problem from a past exam. Find a necessary and sufficient condition for there to exist a square matrix $A$ of order $n$ whose entries are all rational, such that $A^5 = 2I_n$, where $I_n$ stands for the identity matrix of order $n$. By an argument using determinants, one easily sees that $n\in 5\mathbb Z$ is a necessary condition.  Moreover, if we assume such an $A =: A_5$ exists for $n=5$, then for general $n = 5k$, $A = \bigoplus^kA_5$ is what we want. Thus the problem boils down to whether there exists a $5\times5$ rational matrix $A$ such that $A^5 = 2I_5$. What I would like to ask is whether such an $A$ exists, and how one can find such $A$ by hand most efficiently.  I would be grateful for your help.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'block-matrices']"

470232,Left regular action isomorphic to the right regular action,"I am reading something on regular groups and I have a question on why the left and right regular actions are isomorphic. Let $G$ be a group. Consider the homomorphism $\rho: G \rightarrow Sym(G), g \mapsto \rho_g$, where $\rho_g: x \mapsto xg$.  Recall that the image $R(G)$ of this homomorphism is isomorphic to $G$ by Cayley's theorem.  Similarly, the left regular representation $L(G):=\{\lambda_g: g \in G\}$, where $\lambda_g: x \mapsto g^{-1}x$, is also isomorphic to $G$, whence $L(G) \cong R(G)$ since isomorphism is a transitive relation. Alternatively, $\rho_g \mapsto \lambda_g$ gives a direct isomorphism between $R(G)$ and $L(G)$. In the text I'm reading, action by right multiplication is defined as $\mu(x,g) = xg$.  And then the text says ``There is also a left regular representation of $G$ on itself, given by the rule that $\mu(x,g) = g^{-1} x$.  (The inverse is required here to make a proper action: note that $h^{-1}(g^{-1}x)=(gh)^{-1}x$.) It is, as the name says, also a regular action, and so must be isomorphic to the right regular action: indeed the map $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ is an isomorphism.'' My question is on the last part that says that $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ is an isomorphism.  I thought that this was only true for abelian groups. Perhaps the fact that $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ is a bijection is what is required here, given that the text defines two actions to be isomorphic as follows: If $\rho: \Omega \times G \rightarrow \Omega$ and $\lambda: \Delta \times G \rightarrow \Delta$ are $G$-actions, then they are said to be isomorphic if there is a bijection $\theta: \Omega \rightarrow \Delta$ such that $\forall \alpha \in \Omega, g \in G$, we have $\rho(\alpha,g) \theta = \lambda(\alpha \theta,g)$, i.e., each element of $G$ effects essentially the same permutation on these two sets.  It can be verified that this definition of isomorphic actions is satisfied for the left and right regular actions using the correspondence $\theta:x \rightarrow x^{-1}$. So my guess is that the author meant to say the inversion map is a bijection rather than an isomorphism.  I couldn't think of a way to prove that $L(G) \cong R(G)$ or to prove that the left and right regular actions are isomorphic using the fact that $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ is a homomorphism (in fact, I think this inversion map is a homomorphism iff the group is abelian).","['group-actions', 'permutations', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

So far I have proved that $\text{ker}\,T^{\perp}\subset R(T^*)$ implies the inclusion $\overline{\text{ker}\,T}\supset\text{ker}\,\overline{T}$, but this inclusion seems to be false in general. Someone has any clue about the kernel of the closure of an operator? Thanks in advance. Remarks: $M^{\perp}=\{x'\in X'\mid x'(x)=0 \text{ for every } x\in M\}$ where $X'$ is the dual space and $T^*:\mathcal{D}(T^*)\subset Y'\to X'$ is the adjoint. The norm in $X\times Y$ is $||(x,y)||=||x||+||y||$.",['functional-analysis']
