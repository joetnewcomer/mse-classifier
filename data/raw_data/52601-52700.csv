550963,Extended Proof of the Theorem that a bounded analytic function is constant.,"I am having trouble feeling convinced by my proof and more importantly - feeling confident in my working out. The question reads (a)  Let $f$ be an entire function such that there exist real constants $M$ and $N$ such that $|f(z)|<M|z|+N$ for all $z$ . Prove that for any three pairwise different complex numbers $a,b,c$ , $\frac{f(a)}{(a-b)(a-c)}+\frac{f(b)}{(b-a)(b-c)}+\frac{f(c)}{(c-a)(c-b)}=0$ . (b) Deduce that there are constants $A,B\in\mathbb{C}$ such that $f(z)=Az+B$ for all $z$ . So to begin, I realise that the LHS of the equality that I am required to prove is simply the sum of residues (without $2\pi i$ ) of the integral $\oint_{\Gamma}\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)(z-b)(z-c)}dz$ . That is, $$\oint_{\Gamma}\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)(z-b)(z-c)}dz=2\pi i\left(\frac{f(a)}{(a-b)(a-c)}+\frac{f(b)}{(b-a)(b-c)}+\frac{f(c)}{(c-a)(c-b)}\right),$$ for $\Gamma$ being the circle contour of radius $R$ . Furthermore, for the equality to hold, singularities at $z=a,b,c$ must be inside $\Gamma$ . So the next chain of thought would be show that $$\oint_{\Gamma}\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)(z-b)(z-c)}dz=0.$$ This will obviously yield the result I want. I relate to limits and the M-L Lemma to do this. So, $$\left|\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)(z-b)(z-c)}dz\right|\leq\frac{MR+N}{(R-|a|)(R-|b|)(R-|c|)},$$ by the equality given in the question, reserve triangle inequality and since complex numbers $a,b,c$ lie inside the contour thus $|a|,|b|,|c|<R$ . Thus by the M-L lemma we have that $$lim_{R\to\infty}\left|\oint_{\Gamma}\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)(z-b)(z-c)}dz\right|\leq \lim_{R\to\infty}\frac{(MR+N)2\pi R}{(R-|a|)(R-|b|)(R- |c|)}$$ Clearly the RHS of the inequality converges to $0$ . Thus $$lim_{R\to\infty}\oint_{\Gamma}\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)(z-b)(z-c)}dz=0.$$ But we know that $$lim_{R\to\infty}\oint_{\Gamma}\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)(z-b)(z-c)}dz=lim_{R\to\infty}2\pi i\left(\frac{f(a)}{(a-b)(a-c)}+\frac{f(b)}{(b-a)(b-c)}+\frac{f(c)}{(c-a)(c-b)}\right).$$ So $$2\pi i\left(\frac{f(a)}{(a-b)(a-c)}+\frac{f(b)}{(b-a)(b-c)}+\frac{f(c)}{(c-a)(c-b)}\right)=0$$ $$\implies\left(\frac{f(a)}{(a-b)(a-c)}+\frac{f(b)}{(b-a)(b-c)}+\frac{f(c)}{(c-a)(c-b)}\right)=0.$$ With part (b), I begin by using the result I proved. Simplifying the expression I have that $$f(a)(b-c)+f(b)(c-a)+f(c)(a-b)=0.$$ It's clear that if I let $f(z)=Az+B$ and substitute it into the equation above then I am done. Is this valid though?

550983,How to prove that $P[X_1=X^{(i)}]=\frac{1}{n}$?,"Let $X_1$, $X_2$ be two samples draw from a continuous distribution, then I think there is no reason to say that $X_1\leq X_2$ or $X_1\geq X_2$, so we may have

551004,definition of (semi)group (co)homology,"I'm puzzled why ""group cohomology"" contains terms 'group' (instead of 'semigroup') and 'cohomology' (instead oh 'homology and cohomology'). I'm new to the subject. Please inform me of any claims that are not true in the following: Let $S$ be any unital semigroup (=monoid), $R$ a commutative unital ring, $R[S]$ its semigroup $R$-algebra . Let $B_n$ be the free $R[S]$-module on the set $(S\!\setminus\!\{1\})^n$; its basis elements are written $[s_1,\ldots,s_n]$ for given $s_1,\ldots,s_n\!\in\!S$, and let $[s_1,\ldots,s_n]\!=\!0$ when $s_i\!=\!1$ for some $i$. Define $\partial_n\!: B_n\!\rightarrow\!B_{n-1}$ by $$[s_1,\ldots,s_n]\mapsto s_1[s_2,\ldots,s_n]+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(-1)^i[s_1,\ldots,s_is_{i+1},\ldots,s_n]+(-1)^n[s_1,\ldots,s_{n-1}].$$
Define $\partial_0\!:R[S]\to R, \sum_ir_is_i\mapsto\sum_ir_i$. Then $\ldots\to B_n\overset{\partial_n}{\to}B_{n-1}\to\ldots\to B_0\overset{\partial_0}{\to}R\to0$ is an exact sequence of left $R[S]$-modules (a free resolution of the $R[S]$-module $R$), denoted by $B_\ast(S;R)$. For a right $R[S]$-module $M$, the homology of $S$ is the homology of the chain $\mathbb{Z}$-complex $M\otimes_RB_\ast(S;R)$, which is precisely $Tor^{R[S]}_\ast(R,M)$. For a left $R[S]$-module $M$, the cohomology of $S$ is the cohomology of the chain $\mathbb{Z}$-complex $Hom_{R[S]}(B_\ast(S;R),M)$, which is precisely $Ext_{R[S]}^\ast(R,M)$. Every semigroup homomorphism $f\!:S\to S'$ induces a chain map $B_\ast(S;R)\to B_\ast(S',R)$ that sends $[s_1,\ldots,s_n]\mapsto [f(s_1),\ldots,f(s_n)]$, and this construction is functorial. Q1: Where in this construction are inverses of elements of $S$ needed? Q2: Why did we take elements $s\in S\!\setminus\!\{1\}$? Q3: Is the standard way (to show that for a homology theory $H_\ast$ on objects $O,O'$ we have $O\cong O'\Rightarrow H_\ast(O)\cong H_\ast(O')$) done by proving that every morphism $f:O\to O'$ induces chain maps on resolutions in a functorial manner?","['noncommutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'homological-algebra', 'semigroups', 'group-theory']"

551052,"Is the ""first nonzero digit"" function surjective?","For sets $A= \{x \in \mathbb{R}: 0< x< 1 \}$ and $B=\mathbb{Z_+}$ let $f$ be a function $\space f:A \rightarrow B$ such that $f(x)$ is the position of the first nonzero digit of $x$, ex.g. $\space f(0.2)=1$, $\space f(0.02)=2$. Determine whether $f$ is injective and/or surjective. Attempt: It is easy to see that $f$ is not injective since it produces same values for distinct x's. I am having a difficulty with determining whether $f$ is surjective or not. To be surjective the cardinality of $B$ should be less or equal to the cardinality of $A$, $\left\vert{B}\right\vert \le \left\vert{A}\right\vert$. However, both sets have infinite number of elements. So, it might appear they are onto, but on second thought it looks like one set might be bigger than other, namely $\left\vert{B}\right\vert > \left\vert{A}\right\vert$ . I am a little confused here. Clarification would be very helpful. Thank you.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

551101,Investigating the density of special integers,"I was working on a problem earlier and came up with a solution using the following type of integers: Call an integer $n \geq 3$ convenient if the following hold: $n$ is a squarefree odd integer if $\frac{n-1}{2}$ is even, then $\frac{n-1}{2} + 3$ is squarefree if $\frac{n-1}{2}$ is odd, then $\frac{n-1}{2} + 2$ is squarefree So as an example, $1997$ is a convenient integer as $1997 = 2*998 + 1$ and $998 + 3 = 1001$ is squarefree, As is $6551$ since $6551 = 2*3275 + 1$ and $3275 + 2 = 3277 $ is squarefree. I am interested in the density of convenient integers. Using a bruteforce program I found that there are $32$ convenient integers below $100$, $322658$ below $10^6$, $32263455$ below $10^8$, and $322634174$ below $10^9$. Now from looking at this data, it appears that the ratio of convenient integers to integers approaches some constant. I am not sure if there is any method to determine what this is (if it is actually non-zero). I was wondering if anyone has any ideas, or maybe if someone is able to generate more data using a better approach.","['recreational-mathematics', 'number-theory']"

551131,Tail bound sum of unbounded RVs of given mean and variance?,"Let $X_1,\dots,X_n$ be independent variables, $X_i$ having mean $\mu_i$ and variance $\sigma_i^2$.
Let their sum $S = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$. Of course, $S$ has mean $\lambda = \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i$ and variance $\epsilon^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2$. I was wondering if there are nice/simple tail bounds for $S$ in this case? (Edit: Another way to view this is asking for a rate of convergence to the Central Limit Theorem.)
To make things easier feel free to assume all $\mu_i = \mu (= 0)$ and all $\sigma_i = \sigma$, or even that $X_i$ are identically distributed. We can tail bound $S$ using Chebyshev's inequality: $\Pr[|S-\lambda| \geq k\epsilon] \leq \frac{1}{k^2}$. Can we get a better bound at all for $S$? In particular might it be possible to get a Chernoff-type exponential tail bound? If so, does $n$ need to be large (e.g. exponential in $\sigma_i$)? One approach I thought of is to use Chebyshev on each $X_i$ separately, union bound the chance that any of them fail to satisfy this bound, then (with the remaining probability) they are bounded RVs and Chernoff applies. But it looks to me like this shouldn't work out (we need the bound to be on the order of $\sqrt{n}$ in order for the union bound to work, but then it's too big for the Chernoff bound to work). Another is to find a distribution that has the heaviest possible tails for a given mean and variance, assume each $X_i$ is drawn from it, and just figure out a bound for this distribution. Is there any such distribution? Other thoughts/approaches/references? Thanks!","['distribution-tails', 'statistics', 'concentration-of-measure', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

551292,Maximum likelihood estimator of minimum function with exponential RV and a random number,"I'm having some problems with the following assignment: Let $X_1, X_2, ...,, X_n$ be samples from a exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$, and let $c_1, c_2, ..., c_n$ be a sequence of positive numbers. Define
\begin{align*}
Y_i = \min(X_i, c_i) \quad \text{and} \quad \Delta_i = \textbf{1} \{ Y_i = X_i \}.
\end{align*} Determine the likelihood of the observed data $(Y_1, \Delta_1), (Y_2, \Delta_2), ....,(Y_n, \Delta_n)$. My main problems are that I do not know how to calculate the pdf of the $Y_i$, and even if knowing those pdf's, I'm not sure how to use the $\Delta_i$ in the correct way. What I've done so far: I've first followed this post for calculating the pdf of $Y_i$: How to find the pdf of [min(RV.1,RV.2)]/RV.2 So, first notice that $Y_i$ is a random variable supported on $[ 0, c_i]$. For $0 \leq y < c_i$ we see:
\begin{align*}
P(Y_i \leq y) = P(\min(X_i, c_i) \leq y) = P(X_i \leq y) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \; y} 
\end{align*} For $y = c_i$ we see:
\begin{align*}
P(Y_i = y) = P(\min(X_i, c_i) = y) = P(X_i > y) = e^{- \lambda \; c_i}
\end{align*} Let $F_{Y_i}$ denote the distribution function of $Y_i$, then we see:
\begin{align*}
F_{Y_i}(y) &= 1 - e^{-\lambda \; y}  &0 \leq y < c_i \\
F_{Y_i}(y) &= 1 &y = c_i
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
f_{Y_i}(y) = \lambda e^{- \lambda y}, \quad 0 \leq y < c_i
\end{align*}
which obviously does not integrate to 1. Disregarding that for the moment, it seems logical to me that the likelihoodfunction $\mathcal{L}(\lambda)$ then becomes
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(\lambda) = \prod_{i = 1}^n \left( \Delta_i \lambda e^{- \lambda \; Y_i}  + (1 - \Delta_i) e^{- \lambda \; c_i} \right).
\end{align*} Logging this statement we get
\begin{align*}
\log \mathcal{L}(\lambda) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \log\left( \Delta_i \lambda e^{- \lambda \; Y_i}  + (1 - \Delta_i) e^{- \lambda \; c_i}  \right)
\end{align*}
and calculating the derivative gives us
\begin{align*}
\frac{ \mathrm{d} \log \mathcal{L}(\lambda)}{ \mathrm{d} \lambda} = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{\Delta_i e^{\lambda \; c_i}( \lambda Y_i - 1) - c_i (\Delta_i - 1)e^{Y_i \; \lambda} }{(\Delta_i - 1)\lambda e^{\lambda \; Y_i}  - \Delta_i \lambda e^{\lambda \; c_i}}.

Let $M$ be a maximal ideal of $\mathbb{K}[X]$. Then there is a corresponding maximal ideal in $\mathbb{K}[x_1, \dots ,x_n]$, which must be of the form $\langle x_1 - p_1, \dots x_n - p_n \rangle$ for some $p=(p_1, \dots,p_n) \in \mathbb{A}^n$ by the Nullstellensatz.

551422,Deducing that a matrix is indefinite using only its leading principal minors,"$A$ is indefinite iff $A$ fits none of the above criteria. Equivalently, $A$ has both positive and negative eigenvalues. Also equivalently, $x^TAx$ is positive for at least one $x$ and negative for at least another $x$ . Note that the leading principal minors refer to the determinants of
the northwest-corner submatrices, and are merely a subset of all the
principal minors. Now, suppose that a symmetric $n\times n$ matrix $M$ is neither positive definite nor negative definite. Then, can we deduce the following statement (2) or at least statement (1)? If $M$ 's leading principal minors are all nonzero , then $M$ is indefinite; If $M$ has some nonzero leading principal minor, then $M$ is indefinite. I have seen both assertions separately in different texts (e.g. http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/iar1/teaching/Hessians-DefinitenessTutorial.pdf and http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Courses/GraduateTheoryUCSB/BlumeSimonCh16.PDF ), but am unable to prove either. EDIT If a symmetric $n\times n$ matrix $M$ is neither positive definite nor negative definite and det $M$ is nonzero, then $M$ is indefinite. Proof: If det M is nonzero then we can immediately deduce that $M$ has no zero eigenvalues, and since $M$ is neither positive definite nor negative definite, $M$ can only be indefinite.","['optimization', 'multivariable-calculus', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'analysis']"

That set my instincts, and I figured out that that all cubic of the form $x^3 = a + bx$ must have a solution of the form  $(p-q)^\frac{1}{3}+(p+q)^\frac{1}{3}$, so I came to the formula: $$(\frac{a}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{27a^2-4b^3}{108}})^\frac{1}{3} + (\frac{a}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{27a^2-4b^3}{108}})^\frac{1}{3}$$ I have still not managed to verify the formula, especially because of my faulty labelling of $a, b$, and have been a bit lousy to fix that. Anyway, to check my formula i invented the random cubic, $2x^3-5x - 6$, just because it had the root $2$. Now I plug in the values, $b=\frac{5}{2}$ and $a=3$ into my formula, which gives: $$(\frac{9\sqrt{6} - 19}{6\sqrt{6}})^\frac{1}{3} + (\frac{9\sqrt{6} + 19}{6\sqrt{6}})^\frac{1}{3}$$ After that I was not able to do a single manipulation, apart from noticing that the common denominator is $\sqrt{6}$, however Wolfram Alpha tells me that the value is just simply $2$.

551883,Concrete Mathematics - Stability of definitions in the repertoire method,"There are some existing questions on the repertoire method from the first chapter but I think I'm stuck on something different than the part people usually have trouble with. I think the jump in the first chapter from 1.11 to 1.13 is unjustified. Up to this point in the chapter, we have been constructively proving that closed forms exist for various recurrences, but here the authors never formally prove that 1.11 can be written as 1.13. Intuitively I can partly justify it to myself that given the equations of 1.11 any closed form will have to be a sum of alphas, betas, and gammas, and that since n is the only parameter to f that the coefficients of alpha, beta, and gamma must be functions of n. However it is not clear to me why (as the authors seem to assume) every possible f written in this form must have the same definitions for A, B, and C. I can believe that given specific values for alpha, beta, and gamma that we could find satisfying definitions for those functions, but it is not at all clear to me how it is guaranteed those definitions still be stable across all the possible constants we could choose. The rest of the repertoire method example seems to rely on this being the case, so I'm stuck. Put another way, I think of 1.11 as a function that takes three constants (alpha, beta, and gamma) and returns a particular function, $f_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)}(n) = A_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)}(n)\alpha + B_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)}(n)\beta + C_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)}(n)\gamma$. It's not clear why all the As, Bs, and Cs have to be the same across all possible f's. Is there a reason or is it not required that the definitions be stable? Getting independent equations for A, B, and C relies on us picking different f's so I don't see how this couldn't be the case.","['recurrence-relations', 'sequences-and-series']"

that $xRy\wedge yRz$ for some $y\in A$. The goal is to show that
$R$ is transitive, which is basically a conditional statement: if
$xRy$ and $yRz$ hold, then I can infer that $xRz$. Therefore I
can assume $xRy$ and $yRz$, and now should prove that $xRz$. But
because $R^{2}\subseteq R$, I know that $xRy$ and $yRz$ is true
for an arbitrary $(x,z)\in A$. It follows that $(x,z)\in R$. $\Leftarrow$ Assume that $R$ is transitive. Therefore if for any
$(x,z)\in A$ it is true that there is a $y\in A$ such that $xRy$
and $yRz$, I know that $xRz$. Now since $R^{2}\subseteq R$ is also
a conditional statement of the form $\forall(x,y)\in A\times A\;(x,y)\in R^{2}\Rightarrow(x,y)\in R$.
I can assume that there is an ordered pair, call it $(x,z)\in R^{2}$.
Since we assumed that $R$ is transitive, it follows by modus ponens
that $(x,z)\in R$. Now I'll try to prove: $R\text{ is transitive}\iff R^{i}\subseteq R\forall i\geq1$. $\Rightarrow$Assume $R$ is transitive. To prove that $R^{i}\subseteq R,\forall i\geq1$
I can use induction I guess?! Base case: $i=1\Rightarrow R\subseteq R$ obviously holds. Now I'm not really sure whether I actually have to use induction here.
I think what needs to be shown here is pretty straightforward. If
there is a $y\in A$ such that $x1Ry$ and $yRx2$ hold, then because
$R$ is transitive it follows that $x1Rx2$. And then you can continue
this way with $x2$ and $x3$ and in general any value $i$. But I
don't really know how to write this in a formally correct way. Can
anybody help me with that? And please give some feedback on the first
part of the proof.","['relations', 'elementary-set-theory', 'function-and-relation-composition']"

Is there any particular reason for stating the one-to-one property of logarithmic and exponential function beforehand?

552038,Are Base Ten Logarithms Relics?,"Just interested in your thoughts regarding the contention that the pre-eminence of base ten logarithms is a relic from
   pre-calculator days. Firstly I understand that finding the (base-10) logarithm of positive real numbers without a calculator can be reduced to finding the (base-10) logarithm of numbers (strictly) between 1 and 10 via scientific notation
$$\log_{10}(x)=\log_{10}(a\times 10^n)=\log_{10}(a)+\log_{10}(10^n)=\log_{10}(a)+n,\,\,\,(*)$$ and that we could compile (approximate) logarithm tables for $1<a<10$ and hence we can calculate logs base 10. However this can now be done with a calculator... and why would you want to calculate $\log_{10}(x)$ in the first place? The next reason that we might need $\log_{10}(x)$ is to solve equations like $$b^x=n.$$ Now we know that $x=\log_bn$ but we can use the change of base ""formula"" to express this in terms of log base 10. Of course the change of base ""formula"" comes from a calculation like $$\begin{align}
\log_{10}(b^x)&=\log_{10}n
\\\Rightarrow x\log_{10}(b)&=\log_{10}n
\\ \Rightarrow x&=\frac{\log_{10}n}{\log_{10}b}.
\end{align}$$
However the new modern calculators can calculate $\log_bn$ in the first place. Then you could say what about solving 
$$b^{f(x)}=c^{g(x)}.$$
Well you don't need to take a base-10 log: we have the perfectly good base $e$ natural log! In my presently narrow view, it seems to me that it is only stuff like the Richter Scale and sound intensity and similar derived quantities and scales that really use base-10 logs and that while base $e$ logs are clearly useful, that the pre-eminence of base 10 logs is due only to the the by-hand-calculation (*). To ask a specific question... base $e$ is clearly special: Are base 10 logs 'special' only because of the ""ease"" of calculating (or
  should I say approximating) logs base 10? Or am I missing something else? The reason I am looking at this is I have a section of (precalculus) maths notes that is headed ""Two Distinguished Bases"" and I am thinking of throwing out base 10.","['education', 'logarithms', 'algebra-precalculus', 'soft-question']"

(a) For every $x> L^+$ , there exists an $N\ge m $ such that $\,a_n<x$ for all $n\ge N$ (the elements of the sequence are eventually less than $x$ ). Similarly, for every $y<L^-$ there exists an $N\ge m $ such that $\,a_n>y$ for all $n\ge N$ .

(c) We have $\,\text{inf}_{n\ge m}(a_n)\le L^- \le L^+\le \text{sup}_{n\ge m}(a_n)$ (d) If $c$ is any limit point of $(a_n)$ then we have $L^- \le c \le  L^+$ (e) If $L^+$ is finite then it is a limit point of the sequence. Similarly if $L^-$ is finite. (f) Let $c$ be a real number. If $(a_n)\rightarrow c$ , then we must have $L^+=c=L^-$ . Conversely if $L^+=c=L^-$ , then $(a_n)\rightarrow c$ . I'd like to know if my proof is sound. I'd appreciate any suggestion. Proof: Let $a_N^{+}=\text{sup}_{n\ge N} (a_n)$ and $a_N^{-}=\text{inf}_{n\ge N} (a_n)$ . (a) Suppose $x> L^+$ . Let $\varepsilon = x-L^+$ . Thus by definition this means, $\text{inf}_{N\ge m} (a_N^{+}) <x$ ,  so $L+\varepsilon$ cannot be the infimum of the sequence; and thus there is at least one $N\ge K$ ( $K\ge m$ ) such that $a_N^{+}<L+\varepsilon = x$ . Since $\,a_n \le a_N^{+}$ . Thus $a_n \le x $ for each $n\ge N$ . The second part can be proved using a similar argument. (b) Now if $x < L^+=\text{inf}_{N\ge m} (a_N^{+})\le a_N^{+}$ . Let us fix some $N\ge m$ . Thus, $x <a_N^{+}$ , and by definition there must be some $n\ge N$ such that $x< a_n$ (otherwise $x$ would be an upper bound which is less than the least upper bound, which clearly is a contradiction  ), as desired. The other part is proven similarly. (c) Since $\text{sup}_{n\ge m} (a_n) = a_m^+$ and $\text{inf}_{n\ge m} (a_n) = a_m^-$ . Clearly, $a_m^-\le\text{sup}_{N\ge m}(a_N^{-})= L^-$ and $L^+=\text{inf}_{N\ge m} (a_N^{+})\le a_m^+$ . So, we need to show $L^-\le L^+$ . Since we have $a_N^{-}\le a_N^{+}$ for every $N$ . Thus $L^-\le L^+$ (because the limit conserve the non-strict inequality), as desired. (d) Suppose both $L^{+}, L^{-}$ are finite and we let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. By (a) there is some $N$ such that $a_n \le L^+ +\varepsilon$ for each $n\ge N$ . Now, using the definition of limit point, there is some $n_0\ge N$ such that $|a_{n_0}-c| \le \varepsilon$ . Thus $\,c-L^{+}= (c-a_{n_0})+(a_{n_0}-L^{+})\le 2 \varepsilon$ , since $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, this implies $c\le L^{+}$ . Similarly, there is some $M\ge m$ , so that $L^{-}-\varepsilon < a_n$ for each $n\ge M$ . By hypothesis $c$ is a limit point and then, for this $M$ there is an $n'\ge M$ for which $|a_{n'}-c|\le \varepsilon$ . Thus $L^{-}-c = L^{-} - a_{n'}+a_{n'}-c\le 2 \varepsilon$ , i.e., $L^{-}-c\le 2 \varepsilon$ for any $\varepsilon>0$ and hence $L^{-}\le c$ . If $L^{+} = +\infty$ , then $c\le L^{+}$ . Now either $L^{-}=+\infty$ or $L^{-}=-\infty$ . The second case is trivial. But in the first case this would imply that the limit point is infinite and we are not defined yet infinite limit points but follows in the exact same way. (e) Suppose $L^{+}$ is finite and let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. Thus, as a consecuence of (a) there is some $N>m$ so that $a_n<L^{+}+\varepsilon$ for any $n\ge N$ . Using (b) we know that there at least one $n'\ge N$ such that $L^{+}-\varepsilon<a_{n'}$ . So, $L^{+}-\varepsilon< a_{n'}<L^{+}+\varepsilon$ , i.e., $|a_{n'}-L^{+}|\le \varepsilon$ . Since $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary and we can choose any $N\ge m$ , thus $L^{+}$ is a limit point. The other case is symmetric. (f) Suppose $(a_n)\rightarrow c$ ; we wish to show $L^{+}= L^{-}$ , by (c) we already know that $L^{-}\le c\le L^{+}$ so, it will suffice to prove $L^{+}\le c \le  L^{-}$ . Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. Since $(a_n)$ converges to a real number, then is bounded. So, the limit superior and inferior are finite and limit points. There is a $N\ge m$ such that $|a_n-c|\le \varepsilon\,$ for each $n$ , and there is $n'\ge N$ so that $L^{+}-\varepsilon< a_n'$ . Thus $L^{+}-c = (L^{+}-a_n')+(a_n'-c)\le 2\varepsilon$ . And thus $L^{+}\le c$ . A symmetric argument prove that $L^{-}\ge c$ and we're done. To the other direction we assume that $c=L^{+}=L^{-}$ . So, there is some $N_1$ such that $a_n < L^{+} + \varepsilon$ and similarly there is some $N_2$ so that $L^{-} - \varepsilon< a_n$ . We pick the greater between $N_1$ and $N_2$ so, the two inequalities occurs simultaneously. Thus $L^{-} - \varepsilon<a_n < L^{+} + \varepsilon$ and since both are the same, this would imply $|a_n - c|\le \varepsilon$ for every $n\ge N$ , which shows that the sequence converges to $c$ . $\square$","['proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"
552381,When can Jordan's lemma be applied to contours less than a complete semicircle?,"This paper on the evaluation of the Fresnel integral $\int_0^\infty \cos (x^2)\, dx$ claims that the Jordan lemma (see the bottom of page 3) shows that if $C_R$ is the eighth-circle contour $\{R e^{i t}:0 \leq t \leq \pi/4\}$, then $$\lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{C_R} e^{iz^2}\, dz = 0.$$ The explanation glosses over why Jordan's lemma, which applies to semicircular contours in the upper half-plane, can be used even though $C_R$ is not a complete semicircle.  I'm adapting the paper's approach to evaluating the more general integral $\int_0^\infty \cos (x^a)\, dx$ for $a > 1$ (this is a homework problem, if it matters), and understanding why the Jordan lemma can be used is a stumbling block for me.",['complex-analysis']

552425,Proving that the relation $a \le b \iff b - a \ge 0$ is antisymmetric and total.,"Over $\mathbb{R}$ is defined a relation $\le$ in the following way: $$\forall a,b \in \mathbb{R} [a \le b \iff b - a \ge 0]$$ Demonstrate that $\le$ is a relation of total order. For a relation to be of total order, it has to be reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric and total. I already proved reflexive and transitive, but not so with the other two: Antisymmetric We have to prove that for arbitrary elements $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, $$(a \le b \land b \le a) \implies a = b$$ We start: $$a \le b \land b \le a$$ $$b - a \ge 0 \land a - b \ge 0$$ $$b - a + a - b \ge 0$$ $$0 \ge 0$$ Umm... True. That's true. But I doubt this proves that $a = b$. Total We have to prove that $\forall a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, $(a \le b \lor b \le a)$: $$a \le b \lor b \le a$$ $$b - a \ge 0 \lor a - b \ge 0$$ $$b - a + a - b \ge 0$$ $$0 \ge 0$$ Ok, clearly I don't see the bigger picture here. As you can observe, I have the basic mindset of writing what I want to prove, then evaluate it with my premise and then continuously simplify it. I fear that I'm missing the point of this kind of demonstration - I'm not particularly interested in this one exercise, but rather understand better the apparently abstract process that tends to be made for this kind of problem. Can you advice me here?","['relations', 'discrete-mathematics']"

552435,Regarding compactness of a space,"I am trying to solve the following problem: Let $X$ be a metrizable topological space. Prove that the following statements are equivalent. (a) $X$ is compact (b) $X$ is bounded with respect to every metric on $X$ that induces the topology of $X$. (c) Every continuous map $f:X\to \mathbb R$ (with the usual metric on $\mathbb R$) is bounded. My attempt to solve the problem is follows: (a) implies (b): Let $x\in X$ and let $d$ be a metric which induce the topology on $X$. Then $\{B_r(x):r>0\}$ is an open cover for $X$. Since $X$ is compact, there is a ball with radius $s>0$ such that $X=B_s(x)$. Thus $X$ is bounded. But I couldn't proceed further.

552444,Learning about maximal and minimal elements of a set...struggling a little bit with these questions.,"Ok so I'm learning about partial orders, and I think I know the difference between a minimum/minimal & maximum/maximal element of a partially ordered set... but I just was wondering if someone could see if my examples are correct or incorrect and why. 1) For the power set of {1, 2, ..., n}, where n is a positive integer, under the empty relation, would the minimal and minimum element be 1? Would the maximal and maximum be n?
(b.t.w what does ""under the empty relation"" even mean?) (In this case maximum = maximal and minimum = minimal, right?) 2) For the set of nonnegative integers under divisibility, would the minimum/minimal be 0 and there would be no maximal/maximum? (In this case maximum = maximal and minimum = minimal, right?) 3) Is it possible to have a set with no minimal element but a minimum element? Can you please give an example?
