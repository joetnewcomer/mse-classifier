1713880,"simple way to solve differential equation $y''=3\sqrt y, y|_{x=0}=1, y'|_{x=0}=2$","$$y''=3\sqrt y, y|_{x=0}=1, y'|_{x=0}=2$$
On finding the differential equation solution, let $y'=p$, so $ p'=3 \sqrt y $ $p'= \frac{dp}{dx}=\frac{dp}{dy} \frac{dy}{dx} =p \frac{dp}{dy}$, then $ p dp = 3 \sqrt y dy$. Solve
$$\int p dp = \int 3 \sqrt y dy$$
I have $$\frac12p^2=2y^{\frac32} +\frac12c,\ p= \sqrt{4y^{\frac32}+c}$$
$$\int (4y^{\frac32}+c)^{-\frac12} dy = \int dx$$
It's impossible for me to do this integration. I guess there is a simpler approach to use the initial values, but apparently, it can't be used till now.","['indefinite-integrals', 'integration', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
1713881,Why does adding a term $5f'(t)$ to $5f''(t)+10f(t)=0$ cause damping?,"So we have a differential equation to model an oscillator: $$5f''(t)+10f(t)=0$$ Where the initial conditions are $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=4$. It is given that $f(t) = \frac{2\sqrt 2}{5}\sin\sqrt2 t$. Now, if we make make a slight change to the original equation and add in a multiple of $f'(t)$, specifically: $$5f''(t)+5f'(t)+10f(t)=0$$ The initial conditions are still same as before, but it appears adding this $f'(t)$ introduces damping. I solved the equation above to yield: $$f(t)=\frac{8e^{-\frac t2}}{\sqrt 7}\sin \frac{\sqrt 7}{2}t$$ My question is this: why does the addition of a multiple of $f'(t)$ create this effect?","['physics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'mathematical-modeling']"
1713887,Is this a different proof of the fundamental group being abelian?,"I have proved the fundamental group of a topological group is abelian. But I've found nowhere the similar proof as mine. Everywhere I looked up, it was done either exploiting categorical properties or something like taking product of two paths. My proof goes as follows: Let $a$ and $b$ be two loops in a topological group $(G,\bullet )$ starting at the identity element $e$. We need to show $ a\ast b \simeq b\ast a$, where ""$\ast$"" is the fundamental group operation. Now for each $t,s\in [0,1]$, define $F_t(s)=a(st)\ast(a(t)\bullet b(s))\ast \bar a(st)$ Now {$F_t$} gives the homotopy between $b$ and $a\ast b \ast \bar a$. The main idea is at each time $t$, we first go to $a(t)$ along $a$ and then traverse the translated path $a(t)\bullet b$ and then return back along the inverse path of the first one. Continuity of $F$ follows from pasting lemma. This proof seems correct but why do other proofs avoid this straightforward argument?","['algebraic-topology', 'general-topology', 'topological-groups', 'fundamental-groups']"
1713906,How is finiteness of solutions (zero-dimensionality) related to Krull's dimension?,"I have encountered a lot the concept of zero-dimensional ideal : Let $k$ be a field. An ideal $I\subseteq k[x_1,...,x_m]$ is said to be zero-dimensional if its zero set $Z(I)$ has a finite number of elements. In these notes, it is shown that an ideal is zero-dimensional if and only the dimension of $k[x_1,...,x_m] / I$ as a $k-$vector space is finite, and this is usually given as a definition. However, I'm concerned with the relation of this concept with Krull's dimension. Krull's dimension is defined as the supremum of the lengths of all chains of prime ideals. According to this post in MSE, $I$ is zero-dimensional if and only if its quotient ring $k[x_1,...,x_m] / I$ has Krull's dimension zero. My first question is: Is this the reason why the word dimension is involved in the zero-dimensional definition? This is not a primarily opinion-based question. I'm just asking if the word dimension is involved in the definition is related to Krull's dimension in some way or not. My second question is related with the second link I shared (the MSE post). It says that $k[x_1,...,x_m] / I$ has Krull's dimension zero if and only if $I$ is contained in finitely many prime ideals. However, what if $I$ is contained in at least two different prime ideals that have a containment relation? wouldn't the Krull's dimension of $k[x_1,...,x_m] / I$ be non-zero in this case? Thanks a lot for your time, I really hope I can receive some help with these concepts.","['krull-dimension', 'ideals', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"
1713915,Applications of the Mean Value Theorem (but not Mean Value Inequality),"The mean value theorem , found in every calculus textbook since the time of Cauchy (or before), says the following: (MVT) Suppose $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$.  Then there exists $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}$. An immediate corollary is the mean value inequality : (MVI) Suppose $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$.  Suppose further than $|f'| \le M$ on $(a,b)$.  Then $|f(b) - f(a)| \le M |b-a|$. MVI is in some sense a weaker statement than MVT, since for instance, analogous versions of MVI hold in higher dimensions, while analogous versions of MVT fail there.  So I  would not really expect that we can use MVI to easily prove MVT. Now, every mathematically interesting consequence of the MVT I've ever seen can actually be proved using MVI.  (By ""mathematically interesting"" I mean to exclude exercises designed specifically to illustrate the theorem, as well as statements like ""there was some time at which your speedometer read exactly 100 km/hr"" that really just restate the result).  In particular, I think MVI can prove all the ""interesting"" statements in the question Applications of the Mean Value Theorem . Are there any mathematically interesting consequences of MVT which cannot be proved from MVI? (You can interpret ""cannot"" in as formal or informal a sense as you want.

1714026,"How do I know when to use a Venn diagram or a probability tree? Also, when can I assume that the events are independent?","I have 2 specific problems, one 'requiring' me to use a probability tree, and the other a Venn diagram. I know that apparently the Venn diagrams can be converted into probability trees and vice versa, so I have attempted to use the probability diagrams for both questions, which wasn't successful. However, I do not know what I am doing wrong and whether I am assuming something which is not actually true, e.g. that certain events are independent. In some questions I am obliged to assume the latter, whereas in others this gives me erroneous results. Problem 1: 38% of the students in a Year 12 IB Mathematics class are female. Of the female students in this class, 13% are left-handed, whereas 24% of the male students are left handed. a. Find the prob. that a randomly chosen student from this class is left handed.
b. Find the prob. that a randomly chosen student is female, given that the student is left-handed. For this problem, the mark scheme offers a probability diagram: Prob diagram However, I do not understand why in part a it is assumed that the events 'being female' and 'being left-handed' and 'being male' and 'left handed' are independent (as P(A and B)=P(A)P(B)). (It does seem intuitive though.) But then the part b answer implies that the events 'being female' and 'being left-handed are independent' as P(A given B) doesn't equal P(A). What is going on? Problem 2: In the town of Expiet, 71% of the population are right-handed. 44% are either right handed or have blonde hair but not both, and 21% do not have blonde hair. A member of the population is selected at random. Find the likelihood that the person: a. is right handed but not blonde
b. is both right handed and has blonde hair
c. is right handed or has the blonde hair Although the markscheme has used a venn diagram with 4 sets of 4-variable equations, I have attempted to use a prob tree, which was this: Prob tree 2 In this case, I know that this tree is clearly wrong, but I dont know why. The 2nd equation evidently gives me the same result as the probability mentioned in the question, so this is weird. Also, I think that I can't assume that each of the right-handed/ non-right handed branch will have the same prob. of being blonde/non-blonde, but I am unsure. So what is the flaw in my reasoning and what is the correct prob. tree diagram? If someone could clarify the above issues (and perhaps suggest how to convert a Venn diagram into a prob. tree diagram), I would be grateful.","['trees', 'probability', 'decision-trees', 'elementary-set-theory']"
1714031,Looking analytically if one formula is better than another one,"I'm studying errors in functions on numerical methods.

1714310,Structure Sheaves of Rigid Analytic Spaces: What is the right Value Category?,"Let $K$ be a complete non-archimedean field and let $X$ be an affinoid $K$-space. Then the structure sheaf $\mathcal O_X$ of $X$ is defined first on the ""weak Grothendieck topology"", ie on affinoid subdomains, and then by extending the sheaf to the finer ""strong Grothendieck topology"" $\mathcal T$, also called Tate topology. Now while on affinoid subdomains $U\subset X$, the structure sheaf takes values $\mathcal O_X(U)$ in affinoid $K$-algebras, this is not necessarily true any more for general admissible opens, because for instance the value category needs to have arbitrary Cartesian products. In most of the literature I have seen,  the structure sheaf is therefore considered as a functor $$\mathcal O_X: \text{Cat} \mathcal T \longrightarrow K{-}Alg$$ from the underlying category of the Grothendieck topology to just $K$-algebras. Consequently, rigid spaces are later defined to be certain spaces carrying sheaves of locally ringed $K$-algebras. Although I can believe that this works perfectly well, I somehow feel that in doing so we forget some of the structure of $\mathcal O_X(U)$ even for general admissible opens. My question is therefore: What category does $\mathcal O_X$ naturally take values in? In other words, does $\mathcal O_X$ factor through some forgetful functor to $K{-}Alg$? The reason I am asking is that for the examples I first thought of, I always seem to get at least Banach $K$-algebras, although not necessarily topologically of finite type over $K$. If you just read until here and you think you might know an answer to the question,  I would be very happy to get an answer from you, you don't need to read any further. If on the other hand you think that this is an unreasonable question, let me add a few more words about why I think we might get more structure: The way that $\mathcal O_X$ is extended to the finer Grothendieck topology is by a Lemma about sheaves on Grothendieck topologies, so my rigid geometry books don't give all the technicalities. But I think the way this works is by defining $\mathcal O_X(U)$ for an admissible open $U\subset X$ to be the limit
$$\varinjlim_{\mathfrak U} H^0(\mathfrak U,\mathcal O_X)$$
where $\mathfrak U = (U_i)_{i \in I}$ ranges over all admissible coverings by affinoid open subsets of $X$, partially ordered by refinement, and where
$$ H^0(\mathfrak U,\mathcal O_X) = \ker \left( \prod_{i \in I} \mathcal O_X(U_i) \rightrightarrows \prod_{i,j \in I} \mathcal O_X(U_i\cap U_j) \right).$$ So $K$-algebras is a sensible choice for the value category because it has both direct limits and Cartesian products. Banach $K$-algebras doesn't have direct limits (I think), but since $ H^0(\mathfrak U,\mathcal O_X)$ is the kernel of a continuous map from a product of Banach $K$-algebras, it is a Banach $K$-algebra at least in some cases. So maybe we are only taking ""lucky limits"" for which some of the topological structure is preserved? Let me give an example: Let $A = K\langle \zeta\rangle$, $X = Sp(A)$ the unit disc and consider the set $$D(\zeta) = \{x \in X \mid |\zeta(x)|>0\}$$ ie the unit disc pointed at the origin. Then if I am not mistaken, the functions on this subspace are
$$\mathcal O_X(D(\zeta)) = \left\{\sum_{n\in \mathbb Z}a_n\zeta^n \middle | |a_n|\to 0 \text{ for } n\to \infty\text{, and }x^n|a_{-n}|\to 0 \text{ for } n\to \infty\text{ and any }x\in \mathbb R_{>0}\right\}$$
which is indeed complete wrt the natural extension of the Gauss-norm. Here I think that we may be taking advantage of the fact that a neighborhood basis of the origin is given by Weierstraß-domains, and that we can therefore always find a refining covering of the form $\bigcup_{n\in \mathbb N}X(\zeta^{-1};\epsilon^n)$ for some $\epsilon>0$. In particular, $\mathcal O_X(D(\zeta))$ is an inverse limit of Banach-$K$-algebras and therefore again a Banach-$K$-algebra. This makes me wonder: Does the answer to the above question change if we restrict $\mathcal O_X$ to the Zariski topology?","['number-theory', 'arithmetic-geometry', 'grothendieck-topologies', 'rigid-analytic-spaces']"

The player draws 24 more cards, and the deck is full aside from the ace in hand.

However, moving on with the same equation for drawing exactly one ace and three kings: $\dfrac{{3\choose1}.{4\choose3}.{44\choose20}}{{51\choose24}} \approx 9.20\%$ And so, the probability of getting one or the other is $13.81\% + 9.20\% = 23.01\%$.

I can show that $R_i^\complement\in\mathcal A$ and that finite intersections of them are in $\mathcal A$ as well.

  following three properties: 1. All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros. 2. Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it. 3. All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros. If a matrix in echelon form satisfies the following additional conditions, then it is in reduced echelon form (or reduced row echelon form): 4. The leading entry in each nonzero row is 1. 5. Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column. Definition A pivot position in a matrix A is a location in A that corresponds to a leading 1 in the reduced echelon form of A. A pivot column is a column of A that contains a pivot position. Source: Linear Algebra and Its Applications, David C. Lay In the solution,

0 &0 &0 &-5 &0 \\
0 &0 &0 &0  &0 \\
\end{bmatrix} \space \text{are not in reduced echelon form}\\$ The author haven't yet checked if the positions in 2 and -5 satisfy the definition of pivot position when the echelon matrix is reduced to a reduced echelon form. I think if it becomes the reduced echelon form, the columns above the pivot positions, the author determined, can be nonzeros and the entries in pivot positions, author dermined, can be $0$ and or have nonzero entry to its left. So author's determining from the above matrix that leading 1, 2, -5 are pivot positions without reducing the echelon is wrong. Is there something I'm missing? Or doesn't it have a chance of getting a different pivot position when the echelon form is changed into a reduced echelon form? [EDIT  I thinked again after reading your explanation] In a $m×n$ matrix in echelon form of a linear system for some positive integers m, n, let the leading entries $(■)$ have any nonzero value, and the starred entries $(☆)$ have any value including zero. Leading entries $■$s in $R_1$ and $R_2$ in an echelon matrix can become leading 1 in a reduced echelon matrix through dividing them by $■$, and the entry ☆ in $R_1$ above $■$ in $R_2$ can be $0$ by subtracting a multiple of $■$. So $R_1$ and $R_2$ in a matrix in echelon form becomes as follows: $\begin{array}{rcl} 
R_1\space & [■ ☆\cdots ☆☆☆☆]\\
R_2\space & [0 ■\cdots ☆☆☆☆]\end{array} \qquad ~
\begin{array}{rcl} R_1\space & [1 0\cdots ☆☆☆☆]\\R_2 &[0 1\cdots ☆☆☆☆]
 \end{array}$ For all integers k with $2≤k<m$, $R_k$, $R_{k+1}$ in the echelon matrix can be expressed as $R_{k}\space$ $[0 \cdots 0 ■☆☆\cdots ☆]$ $R_{k+1}$     $[0 \cdots 0 0 ■☆\cdots ☆]$. Subtracting a multiple of leading entry of $R_{k+1}$ from  $R_k$ can make the entry above leading $■$ in $R_{k+1}$ be zero, and the leading $■$s in $R_k$, $R_{k+1}$ can be 1 through dividing the rows by leading entry $■$s. So the rows in echelon matrix become the following in reduced $m×n$ echelon matrix: $\begin{array}{rcl} 
R_{k}\space & [0 \cdots 0 ■☆☆\cdots ☆]\\  
R_{k+1} &    [0 \cdots 0 0 ■☆\cdots ☆]\\
 \end{array} \qquad 
\begin{array}{rcl} 
R_{k} & [0 \cdots 0 1 0 ☆\cdots ☆]\\
R_{k+1} & [0 \cdots 0 0 1 ☆\cdots ☆]\\
 \end{array}$ Hence, it's found that leading 1s in reduced echelon form of $m×n$ matrix of a linear system correspond to the locations of the leading non-zero values in a $m×n$ matrix in echelon form of the linear system.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

So then $wRzRy$, meaning $wRy$, which means $w ∈ [y]$. Therefore $[x]$ is a subset of $[y]$. Then I would do this again, but start with an element in $[y]$ and find that it is also in $[x]$, which would prove $[x] = [y]$ by containment.

1714894,Cayley table of a group of order n with 2n entries deleted,"Let $G$ be a group of order $n$, on elements $x_1, ..., x_n$. Let's draw the Cayley table of the group, that is, table $A$ with $a_{i,j}$ = [number of $x_i \circ x_j$ in the list $x_1, ..., x_n$]
After that, if we erase $K$ entries of the table, for some $K$ it's always possible to determine the deleted entries, and for some $K$ it's not possible since there exist some group $G'$ (maybe, isomorphic to $G$ and maybe not) whose Cayley table is different from $A$, but only in some of the erased cells. The question is, whether it's always possible to determine original table (for all sufficiently large $n$) if $K=2n$. Here's what I know so far: if $K=4n-4$, the table can't be reconstructed when we delete 2 rows and 2 columns, corresponding to identity and some other element $x$ (so, after that we won't be able to determine the difference between them, and different tables for the same group count as different) if $K=n$, it's possible for $n \neq 4$, because if some column contains only one empty cell, we know what was written in that cell, since all elements in any column must be different after that, you have at least $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ columns in which you know every single entry Subset of $G$, corresponding to such columns, form a subgroup of $G$, since if you know $x\circ y$ for any $x$, and $x\circ z$ for any $x$ in $G$, then you know $x \circ y \circ z$ for any $x$ in $G$, and $y^{-1}=y^{n-1}$. Let's denote that subgroup $H$. So if you know more than $\frac{n}{2}$ columns, you can reconstruct the table, and the only case when you can't is when $n$ is even and in exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ columns exactly two entries are unknown. The set of elements corresponding to not-yet-known columns is a coset of $H$ ($H$ is subgroup of index 2). That is, its elements are of the form $gh$, $h \in H$, where $g$ is fixed. To know what is $gh_i \circ gh_j$, it's sufficient to know which element equals $gh_i g$ (since we know how to multiply by elements of $H$). And to determine $gh_ig$ we look at cells corresponding to $gh_i \circ gh_j$ (they are in the same column) For all $j$ (except maybe two) we know the value of $g h_i g h_j$ and so, if $n>4$, we definitely know what is $gh_i g$. The same for $h_i \circ gh_j$ So, I'm asking about $K=2n$. Those tricks with subgroup of index two won't work, but I don't think that there are counterexamples for arbitrarily large $n$.

Let $E$ be the set of all $x \in [0,1]$ whose decimal expansion contains only the digits $4$ and $7$. Is $E$ countable? Is $E$ dense in $[0,1]$? Is $E$ compact? Is $E$ perfect? My effort: The set $E$ is not countable. The proof is essentially the same as that for showing that the set of all the binary sequences is uncountable. Am I right? The set $E$ is not dense in $[0, 1]$. The smallest element in $E$ is 
$$x_\min \colon= \frac{4}{10} + \frac{4}{10^2} + \frac{4}{10^3} + \ldots = \frac{4}{9},$$
and the largest element in $E$ is 
$$x_\max \colon= \frac{7}{10} + \frac{7}{10^2} + \frac{7}{10^3} + \ldots = \frac{7}{9}.$$
Thus, the set $E$ is (strictly) contained in the closed interval $[\frac{4}{9}, \frac{7}{9}]$. So, the element $\frac{1}{5}$ of $[0,1]$, for example, does not lie in the closure of $E$. Am I right? The set $E$ is clearly bounded. So, for compactness, it suffices to show that $E$ is closed. [It does not matter if $E$ is closed in $[0,1]$ or $\mathbb{R}$, as the former is a closed set in the latter.] So we show that the complement of $E$ in $[0,1]$ is open in $[0,1]$. Let $x \colon= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{d_n}{10^n}$ be an arbitrary element of $[0,1]-E$, where each $d_n \in \{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9 \}$. Then there is a positive integer $n$ such that $d_n \not\in \{4, 7\}$. Let $N$ be the least such positive integer, and let $\delta$ be a real number such that 
$$0< \delta < \frac{\min\left( \vert d_N - 4 \vert, \vert d_N - 7 \vert \right)}{10^{N+2}}.  $$
Let $y \colon= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{e_n}{10^n}$ be an element of $E$, where each $e_n$ is either $4$ or $7$. Let's also assume that $e_n = d_n$ for all $n \in \{1, \ldots, N-1\}$. What next? How to show that $y$ fails to be within $\delta$ of $x$? For showing that $E$ is perfect, we need to show that $E$ is closed and that each element of $E$ is a limit point of $E$. Let $x \colon= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{d_n}{10^n}$ be an arbitrary element of $E$, where each $d_n$ is either $4$ or $7$. Let $\delta > 0$. Then there exists a smallest positive integer $N$ such that $$\frac{3}{10^N} < \delta.$$ Let $y \colon= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{d_n^\prime}{10^n}$, where each $d_n^\prime$ is either $4$ or $7$, be the element of $E$ such that $$d_n^\prime = 
\begin{cases} 
d_n \ \mbox{ if } \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \mbox{ and } n \neq  N; \\
4 \ \mbox{ if } \ n = N \ \mbox{ and } d_N = 7; \\
7 \ \mbox{ if } \ n = N \ \mbox{ and } d_N = 4. 
\end{cases}
$$
Then 
$$0< \vert x -y \vert < \delta.$$
This shows that each element $x$ of $E$ is also a limit point of $E$. Am I right?","['general-topology', 'real-analysis', 'compactness', 'analysis']"

1715435,Is Arens Square a Urysohn space?,"Example 80 in Steen-Seebach 1 is called Arens Square. It is defined in the book as follows: Let $S$ be the set of rational lattice points in the interior of the unit square except those whose $x$ -coordinate is $\frac12$ .
Define $X$ to be $S\cup\{(0,0)\}\cup\{(1,0)\} \cup \{(\frac12,\sqrt2r); r\in\mathbb Q, 0<r\sqrt2<1\}$ .
We define a basis for a topology on $X$ by granting to each point of $S$ the local basis of relatively open sets which $S$ inherits from the Euclidean topology on the unit square, and to the other points of $X$ the following local bases: \begin{align*}
U_n(0,0) &= \{(0,0)\} \cup \{(x,y); 0<x<\frac14, 0<y<\frac1n\},\\
U_n(1,0) &= \{(0,0)\} \cup \{(x,y); \frac34<x<1, 0<y<\frac1n\},\\
U_n(\frac12,r\sqrt2) &= \{(x,y); \frac14<x<\frac34, |y-r\sqrt2|<\frac1n\}
\end{align*} The authors claim that: With this topology $X$ is $T_{2½}$ .
This may be seen by direct consideration of cases noting that neither any point of $S$ nor $(0,0)$ nor $(0,1)$ may have the same $y$ coordinate as a point of the form $(\frac12,r\sqrt2)$ . A Urysohn space or $T_{2½}$ -space is a space in which any two distinct points can be separated by closed neighborhoods. (I.e., they have disjoint closed neighborhoods. In Steen-Seebach such spaces are call such spaces completely Hausdorff. As far as I can say, the name Urysohn space is more frequent.) The problem I see with the above claim is the following: Let us take two points $a=(\frac38,y)$ and $b=(\frac58,y)$ , $y\in\mathbb Q$ , which have the same $y$ -coordinate and belong to the ""middle part"". If we take any neighborhoods $O_a\ni a$ and $O_b\ni b$ then they contain neighborhoods of the form $B(a,\frac1n)\cap S$ , $B(b,\frac1n)\cap S$ for some $n$ . Now let $c$ be any point of the form $(\frac12,r\sqrt2)$ with $y-1/n<\sqrt2r<y+1/n$ . Then every basic neighborhood of $c$ intersects these two balls and, consequently, it intersects $O_a$ and $O_b$ . Which means that $c\in \overline{O_a} \cap \overline{O_b}$ . So the points $a$ and $b$ do not have neighborhoods with disjoint closures. What am I missing here? Or is it a mistake in this book? (In fact, the above problem was found by a colleague of mine. But since I was not able to answer his doubts, I decided to ask here.) The authors also say that this is a modification of an example given in a paper by Hewitt. I had a look at that paper, but I did not find there exactly the same example as this one. Hewitt [51] credits Arens with constructing an example of this type; we present a modified version, and then a simplified version.

1. To sort out my approach. 
2. In understanding the enlightened approach of the book. Here is my approach. I noticed that this problem can be recast to be asking, how many ways can three numbers add up to give a sum of $3n$ with this constraint. $$a + b + c = 3n$$ 
$$ 0 \leq a, b, c \leq 2n$$ I also noticed that for each way we give these objects ne person, there is only one corresponding way to give it to the other person. So, to count the number of ways the distribution can be done, it is sufficient to count the number of ways one person is given the objects. Here, is what I've done. I fix the value of $a$, and then vary $b $and $c $. $$ 
\begin{align}
0 &&+ n &&+ 2n \\ 
0 &&+ n+1&& + 2n-1 \\ 
\vdots \\
0 && + n + n && + 2n -n

$$ The $0$ can be placed in any box. So the total number of possibilities is $3\times(n+1)$. $$ 
\begin{align}
1 &&+ n -1&&+ 2n \\ 
1 &&+ n&& + 2n-1 \\ 
\vdots \\
1 && + n + n && + 2n -(n+1)

$$ Similarly, the total number of ways this can be done is $3\times(n+2)$. $\vdots$ $$ 
\begin{align}
n-1 &&+ 1 &&+ 2n \\ 
n-1&&+ 2&& + 2n-1\\

$$ The total number of ways is $3\times(2n)$. After this we stop because if $a = n $, one of the other two become $0$ and this possibility is already counted.

I've written the part in bold. $X/G$ is the orbit space obtained from $X$ by means of the equivalence relation $x \sim g(x)$ for all $x\in X$ and all $g \in G$, and $e$ is the identity element of $G$. Theorem 81.5. Let $X$ be path connected and locally path connected; let $G$ be a subgroup of the group of homeomorphisms of $X$. The quotient map $\pi : X \to X/G$ is a covering map if and only if the action of $G$ is properly discontinuous. In this case, the covering map $\pi$ is regular and $G$ is its group of covering transformations. Proof: We suppose now that $\pi$ is a covering map and show that the action of $G$ is properly discontinuous. Given $x\in X$, let $V$ be a neighborhood of $\pi(x)$ that is evenly covered by $\pi$. Partition $\pi^{-1}(V)$ into slices; let $U_\alpha$ be the slice containing $x$. Given $g\in G$, with $g\neq e$, the set $g(U_\alpha)$ must be disjoint from $U_\alpha$, for otherwise, two points of $U_\alpha$ would belong to the same orbit and the restriction of $\pi$ to $U_\alpha$ would not be injective. It follows that the action of $G$ is properly discontinuous. I have trouble figuring out the bolded part. Letting $y\in U_\alpha \cap g(U_\alpha)$, I don't see how this leads to a problem in the case $g(y)=y$, since then we don't get two different points belonging to the same orbit. In the most extreme case, what problem do we have if $g$ is identity restricted to $U_\alpha$? I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could explain this line to me.","['algebraic-topology', 'general-topology', 'covering-spaces']"

1715667,Convert a joint entropy matrix to a contidional entropy matrix.,"I've only barely started to learn about Entropy and Information Theory as a part of a course I'm taking in Systems Theory / Cybernetics. The thing is, I'm terrible at math! Say I have a joint probability matrix as follows: y1    y2
  ----------
x1| 1/2  1/4
x2| 0    1/4 In other words: the probability of x1 and y1 occurring is 0.5 the probability of x1 and y2 occurring is .25 the probability of x2 and y1 occurring is 0 the probabiltiy of x2 and y2 occurring is .25 Apparently, this corresponds to the following conditional probability matrix (Y conditioned by X): y1   y2
  -----------
x1| 2/3  1/3
x2| 0    1 In other words: If we know x1 will occur, then there is a 2/3 chance y1 will occur and a 1/3 chance y2 will occur. If we know x2 will occur, then there is a 100% chance that y2 will occur. So, I have 2 questions. Are my interpretations correct? How was the second matrix derived from the first? I'm sure the formula is embarrassingly simple as all the material I'm reading seems to assume the conversion function is self-evident.

What is the probability of you getting rolls of each number at least once in $n$ tries? I realize this question wasn't very elegantly put, and that's because this was a question I asked myself when I was playing a game. The principle is the same but the question was changed so that game-specific vocabulary don't confuse people. I first tried $(0.1^8) (8!/8^8) \,{_n}C_8$ but then quickly realized my mistake as $n<8$ didn't give $P=0$ and it was also possible for $P$ to be $>1$. After a few more failed attempts and some research I realized that this question might be beyond my current knowledge and that this rabbit hole might be deeper than I initially thought. It is a rather weird question, but I was hoping if I can get some answers here. Edit: It would seem that my question ended up being confusing after all, so let me clarify. The octahedrons are shaped the exact same but only one of them is actually a die. Or really, the point was that every time there's only a 0.1 chance that you get to roll the die.",['probability']

The function $x\mapsto e^{-n^2x^2}\psi(x)$ has no singularities, hence contour integration wouldn't help. Integration by parts or substitution also doesn't seem to be of great help. The major problem is that there is a function $\psi$ inside the integral about which we don't know really anything apart from the fact that it is $C^\infty$ and with compact support.

1716063,Derivative of cot(x),"If we rewrite $\displaystyle \frac {d} {dx} \cot(x)$ as $\displaystyle \frac {d} {dx} \frac {1} {\tan(x)}$ and then apply the quotient rule, we get to $\displaystyle \frac {\tan(x)\frac{d}{dx}1-1\frac{d}{dx}\tan(x)} {\tan^2(x)}$ and then $\displaystyle \frac {-\sec^2(x)} {\tan^2(x)} = -\frac {1} {\cos^2(x)} \cdot \frac{\cos^2(x)} {\sin^2(x)} = -\csc^2(x)$ My question is that will this proof be valid for $\displaystyle \frac {\pi} {2}$? The derivative of $\tan(x)$ is $\sec^2(x)$ only for angles for which $\tan(x)$ is defined. $\tan(x)$ is undefined for $\frac {\pi} {2}$, so in the above quotient rule, when it is claimed that $\frac {d} {dx} \tan(x) = \
sec^2(x)$, that comes with the caveat that $x \neq \frac {\pi} {2}$ (as well as $\frac {3\pi} {2}$ and their co-terminals). Now $\frac {\pi} {2}$ is in the domain of $\cot(x)$, but I don't think that the proof in the opening paragraph holds for $\frac {\pi} {2}$ If I go by the first principle i.e.
$$\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0} \frac  {cot(x+h)-cot(h)} {h}$$, then I get a proof which works for all angles in the domain of $\cot(x)$ including $\frac {\pi} {2}$ Similarly, if I apply the quotient rule on $\displaystyle \frac {d} {dx} \cot(x) = \frac {d} {dx} \frac {\cos(x)} {\sin(x)}$, I don't run into any problems with $\frac {\pi} {2}$ So, I am just curious if the proof outlined in the first para is applicable for $\frac {\pi} {2}$.
