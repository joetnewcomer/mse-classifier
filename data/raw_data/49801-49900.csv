508212,Almost surely equal random variables and expectation,"Let $X, Y$ be random variables defined on the same probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$. I'm interested in seeing a proof for the following results: a) If $P(X = Y) = 1$, then $E(X) = E(Y)$. b) If $P(X \le Y) = 1$, then $E(X) \le E(Y)$. It is intuitive that what happens in a set with probability 0 should not change the expectation because it is defined in terms of simple functions, but I don't know how to prove the results rigorously. Also, I would like to know whether there is any extra condition for this to hold (e.g. $E(|X|)$ and $E(|Y|)$ be finite). I don't have a background in integration theory or graduate analysis, so I'm learning how to write proofs at the same time I'm learning probability theory.

508217,Showing that rationals have Lebesgue measure zero.,"I have been looking at examples showing that the set of all rationals have Lebesgue measure zero. In examples, they always cover the rationals using an infinite number of open intervals, then compute the infinite sum of all their lengths as a sum of a geometric series. For example, see this proof . However, I was wondering if I could simply define an interval $(q_n - \epsilon, q_n + \epsilon )$ around each rational number $q_n$ . Since there is a countable number of such intervals, the Lebesgue measure must be bound above by a countable sum of their Lebesgue measure (subadditivity). i.e. $$\mu(\mathbb{Q}) \leq \mu(\bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} (q_n - \epsilon, q_n + \epsilon)) = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \mu((q_n - \epsilon, q_n + \epsilon))$$ Then, argue that each individual term is $\mu((q_n - \epsilon, q_n + \epsilon)) < 2\epsilon$ and is thus zero since the epsilon is arbitrary?",['measure-theory']
508243,Show convergence of a sequence of continuous functions $f_n$ to a continuous function $f$ does not imply convergence of corresponding integrals.,"Let $f_n\in C([0,1])$ be a sequence of functions converging uniformly to a function $f$. Show that 
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_0^1f_n(x)dx = \int_0^1 f(x)dx.$$ Give a counterexample to show that the pointwise convergence of continuous functions $f_n$ to a continuous function $f$ does not imply the convergence of the corresponding integrals. I have the following counterexample: $$f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 2n^2 x & 0\leq x \leq\frac{1}{2n} \\
-2n^2(x-\frac{1}{n}) & \frac{1}{2n}\leq x \leq \frac{1}{n} \\
0 & \frac{1}{n}\leq x \leq 1 \end{cases}$$ I am having trouble seeing how this function converges to 0. I may be looking at this wrong but when you take $n\rightarrow\infty$ doesn't this function look like this? $$f_n(x) = \begin{cases} \infty & 0\leq x \leq 0 \\
\infty & 0\leq x \leq 0 \\
0 & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \end{cases}.$$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Where I am having trouble seeing $f_n\rightarrow 0$. Am I looking at the convergence of functions in a wrong way? If so how should I consider seeing how such functions converge? I know the integral of $\int_0^1 f_n = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\int_0^1\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n = 0$. Also I don't need help with the proof concerning integrals. Just on the counterexample.

508390,Definition of Cartier divisors,"My question regards the definition of Cartier divisors. Let $X$ be a scheme correspoding to a variety over an algebraically closed field, and $\mathcal{K}$ the constant sheaf of rational functions of $X$. Let $\mathcal{K}^{*}$ the sheaf of invertible elements of $\mathcal{K}$, and $\mathcal{O}_{X}^{*}$ be the sheaf of invertible elements of the structure sheaf. 
A Cartier divisor on $X$ is a global section of $\mathcal{K}^{*}/\mathcal{O}_{X}^{*}$. On Robin Hartshone's book ""Algebraic Geometry"", I read that any Cartier divisor is determined by an open covering $\{U_{i}\}$ of the underlying topological space of $\mathcal{K}^{*}/\mathcal{O}_{X}^{*}$, and for each $U_{i}$ an element $t_{i}\in \Gamma (U_{i},\mathcal{K}^{*})$ such that $t_{i}/t_{j}\in \Gamma (U_{i}\cap U_{j}, \mathcal{O}_{X}^{*})$ for any $i,j$.

508413,Blowup of $xy-z^2$,"I try to compute the blowup of $f=xy-z^2 \subset \mathbb{A}^3$ at the origin, but got something I could not explain: Let $A=\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(f)$, and  $m=(x,y,z)$ be the ideal corresponding to the origin. Then the blowup is 
$${\rm Proj}(A\oplus (m/f)t\oplus \cdots \oplus(m^k + (f)/(f))t^k\oplus\cdots).$$ Set graded ring $G:=A\oplus (m/f)t\oplus \cdots \oplus(m^k + (f)/(f))t^k\oplus\cdots$ (I insert variable $t$ in order to keep track of grading),  $$\Gamma:=A[u,v,w]$$ with $u,v, w$ variables, then one has a surjective graded ring morphism:
$$\Gamma \to G$$
sending $u,v,w$ to $xt,yt,zt$ respectively. The kernel should be ideal $I:=(uy-vx, uz-wx,vz-wy)$, and hence we have an isomorhism $\Gamma/I \cong G$, and the blowup is ${\rm Proj}(\Gamma/I)$. We can take an affine piece of this projective variety, say $w \neq 0$. Then it can be written as $${\rm Spec}((A)[u/w,v/w]/J)$$
where $J=(uy/w-vx/w, uz/w-x, vz/w-y)$. In order to simplify the notation, we can assume $w=1$, and set $u/w=u$ etc. Under this notation, we can rewrite above by 
$${\rm Spec}((\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(xy-z^2))[u,v]/J')$$ where $J'=(uy-vx,uz-x,vz-y)$. And hence can be simplified by $${\rm Spec}(\mathbb{C}[uz,vz,z]/(uvz^2-z^2))[u,v],$$ and furthermore $${\rm Spec} (\mathbb{C}[u,v,z]/(uvz^2-z^2)).$$ One can show this affine piece maps to ${\rm Spec}\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(xy-z^2)$ by maps $x,y,z$ to $uz,vz,z$ respectively. Question: (1)Does $${\rm Spec} (\mathbb{C}[u,v,z]/(uvz^2-z^2))$$ corresponds to the blowup of $f$ restricted to an affine piece? (2)The above variety is an union of $z^2=0$ and $uv-1=0$, what does each piece mean? $z^2=0$ does not seem like an exceptional divisor because it is dimension $2$, and  the exceptional divisor should have dimension $1$.","['algebraic-geometry', 'complex-geometry']"

If $f^{-1}(G)$ is open in $X$ for every open set $G$ in $Y$, then $f$ is continuous. The text I am using proves this proposition like so: Suppose that $f$ is discontinuous at some point $a\in X$. Then there is an $\epsilon >0$ such that for every $\delta>0$, there is an $x\in X$ with $d(x,a)<\delta$ and $d(f(x),f(a))\geq \epsilon.$ It follows that, although $a$ belongs to the inverse image of the open set $B_{\epsilon}(f(a))$ under $f$, the inverse image does not contain $B_{\delta}(a)$ for any $\delta>0$, so it is not open. I am having trouble understanding how $B_{\delta}(a)$ is not contained in $f^{-1}(B_{\epsilon}(f(a)))$. If $d(x,a)<\delta$ implies  $d(f(x),f(a))\geq \epsilon$. My questions are: 1) What does the preimage of $f^{-1}(B_{\epsilon}(f(a)))$ look like? Is it a set with radius greater than $\delta$ or less than $\delta$? How could I see this if I were to draw a picture? This answer may clarify questions 2) and 3). 2) If $B_{\delta}(a)$ is not contained in $f^{1}(B_{\epsilon}(f(a)))$ then $B_{\delta}(a)$ is a larger set than $f^{-1}(B_{\epsilon}(f(a)))$. Is this correct? 3) If so doesn't this mean that $f^{-1}(B_{\epsilon}(f(a)))$ maps points inside the $B_{\delta}(a)$?

$$(1^a+2^a+3^a+4^a)^b=1^c+2^c+3^c+4^c,$$
$$\vdots$$
then $(a,b,c)=(1,2,3).$ Motivation : This question comes from $$\left(\sum_{k=1}^nk\right)^2=\sum_{k=1}^nk^3.$$ This got me interested in $(\star)$. I've got the followings : 1. If $(\star)$ for any $n\in\mathbb N$, then $(a,b,c)=(1,2,3).$ We can easily prove this by considering the limitation $n\to\infty$ of the both sides of 
$$\frac{n^{(a+1)b}}{n^{c+1}}\left\{\sum_{k=1}^n\frac 1n\left(\frac kn\right)^a\right\}^b=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac 1n \left(\frac kn\right)^c.$$ 2. If $(\star)$ for $n=2$, then $(a,b,c)=(1,2,3).$ Expanding LHS of $(1+2^a)^b=1+2^c$ gives us that $b$ is even. Setting $b=2d$, we have $((1+2^a)^d-1)((1+2^a)^d+1)=2^c\Rightarrow (1+2^a)^d-1=2^e,(1+2^a)^d+1=2^f$. Then, since we have $2^f-2^e=2$, we have $(e,f)=(1,2)$. These lead $(a,b,c)=(1,2,3)$. 3. If $(\star)$ for $n=3$, then $(a,b,c)=(1,2,3).$ In the following, I'm going to prove 3 . Proof : Supposing $c\le ab$, since $b\ge 2$, we get
$$(1+2^a+3^a)^b=1+2^{ab}+3^{ab}+\cdots\gt 1+2^c+3^c.$$ This is a contradiction. Hence, $c\gt ab$. Supposing $b\ge 3$, we get $c\gt ab\ge 3$. Here, since $3^c+1\equiv 4,2$ (mod $8$) for any $c\in\mathbb N$, $3^c+1$ is not a multiple of $8$. By the way, since $1+2^a+3^a$ is even, $(1+2^a+3^a)^b$ is a multiple of $8$. Since $2^c$ is a multiple of $8$, this leads that $3^c+1$ is a multiple of $8$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $b=2, c\gt 2a$. If $a\ge 3$, since
$$\left(\frac 23\right)^a+\left(\frac 13\right)^a\le\left(\frac 23\right)^3+\left(\frac 13\right)^3=\frac13,$$
$2^a+1\le \frac{3^a}{3}.$ Hence, 
$$3^c\lt 1+2^c+3^c=(1+2^a+3^a)^2\le \left(\frac{3^a}{3}+3^a\right)^2=3^{2a}\left(\frac 43\right)^2=3^{2a}\cdot\frac {16}{9}\lt 3^{2a+1}.$$
$3^c\lt 3^{2a+1}$ leads $0\lt c-2a\lt 1$, which means that $c-2a$ is not an integer. This is a contradiction. Hence, we know $a=1$ or $a=2$. The $(a,b)=(1,2)$ case leads $c=3$. The $(a,b)=(2,2)$ case leads $c\ge5\Rightarrow 1+2^c+3^c\gt 196$, which is a contradiction. Now the proof is completed. After getting these results, I reached the above conjecture. Can anyone help?

508907,"PID with infinitely many maximal ideals, irreducible, generic points.","I am trying to do this question and will appreciate if anyone gives comment on my attempt. I am sure there are mistakes somewhere, so I will be glad if someone points them out to me: Let $A$ be a principal ideal domain with infinitely many maximal ideals. Show that any subset of $\mbox{Spec} A$ that consists of infinitely many closed points is irreducible, but does not contain a generic point. Attempt Suppose we have $S$ such a set. This set is irreducible in $\mbox{Spec} A$ if and only if its closure $\overline{S}$ is irreducible. So I will work with $\overline{S}$. Next I claim that $\overline{S}=\mbox{Spec}A$. Since it is closed, and $A$ is PID, so $\overline{S}=V(f)$ for some element $f\in A$. Suppose $f\neq 0$. Since $A$ is also UFD, so there can only be finitely many maximal ideals belonging to $V(f)$. [Here I use the result that a point $\{\frak{p}\}$ in $\mbox{Spec}A$ is closed if and only if $\frak{p}$ is maximal ideals, and since it is PID, every prime ideals are maximal ideals anyway.] Hence $\overline{S}=\mbox{Spec}A$. Now $\mbox{Spec}A$ is irreducible because if we have $\mbox{Spec}A\subseteq V(f)\cup V(g)$ for some $f\in A$, $g\in A$, then $\mbox{Spec}A$ can only have finitely many closed points because $A$ is PID (and therefore UFD), which contradicts that $A$ has infinitely many maximal ideals. Hence $\overline{S}$ is irreducible, and so is $S$. For the second part, I guess it is because if there is a generic point $\{\frak{p}\}$ in $S$, then $\{\frak{p}\}$ itself is closed in $S$ and so it can't be generic because $S$ has infinitely many closed points. In fact, what I tried for the second part was that $S$ is irreducible and closed, so it has a generic point, $\{\frak{p}\}$. So $S\subseteq \{\frak{p}\}$ which is absurd. But then this would only mean that $\overline{S}$ has no generic points, yet an irreducible closed set has a generic point. Confusion I a bit confused here because does that mean that from my argument, $\mbox{Spec}A$ does not have a generic point?? But a closed irreducible subspace has a generic point.

509009,Open subschemes of affine schemes are affine?,"I'm reading Hartshorne, and was wondering if this was true: Let $A$ be a ring and let $U$ be an open subset of $Spec(A)$. Let $S$ be the set of elements of $A$ not in any prime of $U$. Then $S$ is multiplicatively closed and $\mathcal{O}_A|_U \cong Spec(A[S^{-1}])$ as schemes. It seems like you would certainly want open subsets of affine schemes to be affine, but I can't seem to find a proof in Hartshorne. Perhaps it's too ""obvious"" to bother proving, but here is a supposed proof: $S$ is obviously multiplicatively closed. The map $A \rightarrow A[S^{-1}]$ induces an inclusion-preserving bijection between primes not meeting $S$ and primes of $A[S^{-1}]$. I claim that the primes in $U$ are precisely those that do not meet $S$: if $U^c = V(\mathfrak{a})$, then we show that some element of $S$ lies in $\mathfrak{a}$. If not, then each element of $\mathfrak{a}$ is not in $S$, and so $\mathfrak{a} \subset \bigcup \big\{\mathfrak{p} : \mathfrak{p} \in U\big\}.$ A result of commutative algebra (Atiyah-MacDonald Prop 1.11) then has $\mathfrak{a} \subseteq \mathfrak{p}$ for some $\mathfrak{p}$, a contradiction. Hence any prime not in $U$ contains $\mathfrak{a}$ and so meets $S$. The primes that are in $U$ do not meet $S$ by definition. This gives a homeomorphism $\phi:U \rightarrow Spec(A[S^{-1}])$ on the level of spaces. We now build an isomorphism of schemes. Let $W$ be an open set of $A[S^{-1}]$. The correspondence of ideals gives an open set in $U$, which we will denote $V$. Suppose $F:W \rightarrow \bigsqcup_{\mathfrak{p} \in W} A[S^{-1}]_\mathfrak{p}$ is locally a fraction. Pick $\mathfrak{p} \in W$. Then let $f = \frac{a}{s} \in A[S^{-1}]$ satisfy $\mathfrak{p} \in D(f) \subseteq W$, and choose $b \in A$ such that $F(\mathfrak{q}) = \frac{b}{f} \in A[S^{-1}]_\mathfrak{q}$ for each $\mathfrak{q} \in D(f)$. Now, if $\mathfrak{p} \in D(f)$, then $\mathfrak{p}\cap A$ does not contain $a$, and conversely. So $D(f)$ is sent to the open set $D(a)$ in $A$. So if we define $G$ on $V$ by $G(\mathfrak{p}\cap A) = F(\mathfrak{p}) \in A[S^{-1}]_\mathfrak{p} \cong A_{\mathfrak{p}\cap A}$, then on $D(a)$, we have $G(\mathfrak{p}\cap A) = F(\mathfrak{p}) = \frac{b}{f} = \frac{sb}{a} \in A_{\mathfrak{p} \cap A}$. So $G$ is locally a fraction, and so this defines $\Gamma(A[S^{-1}], W) \rightarrow \Gamma(A,V)$ and so produces a morphism of schemes. On stalks, this morphism is an isomorphism, and so the morphism itself is an isomorphism of schemes. Does this proof look correct? I'm always afraid I've missed something subtle with these things.

I have always thought that $dy/dx$ was just a different form of notation for a function, $f'(x)$ that described the rate of change of y vs. x.

Let X be a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g \geq 2$ endowed with a separable morphism $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1_k$ of degree 2. We can write $K(X) = k(t)[y]$ with a relation $y^2+Q(t)y=P(t)$ .Let $x_0 \in X(k)$ and assume that $x_0$ is a Weierstrass point, i.e that $l(2x_0) \geq 2$. We want to show that a Weierstrass point is a ramification point. We know that fixed points of the hyperelliptic involution $\rho$ are ramification points. The exercise is divided in steps, in a) assume that $x_0$ is not a ramifcation point, then $x'_0 = \rho(x_0)$ is distinct from $x_0$. Now you take $h \in L(2x_0) \setminus k$ , and show that $(h \pm \rho(h))_\infty = 2[x_0]+2[x'_0] = 2 f^\ast [f(x_0)]$. I have no problem with showing this. In b) you show that you can assume that h is of the form $h=a(t)+b(t)y$ . I can do this without problem. Here is my problem: c) By considering the degree of $h - \rho(h)$, show that $g \leq 1$.

509261,Take a regular coordinate ball and you get a manifold with boundary.,"Suppose $M$ is a (topological) manifold of dimension $ n \geq 1$ and $B$, is a regular coordinate ball in $M$. 
Show that $M\backslash B$ is an $n$-manifold with boundary and whose boundary is homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}$ Ok, so here is what I have. $M\backslash \overline{B}$ is an open space in $M$ and hence is locally euclidean. So what's left is to prove that $\partial B$, the boundary of $B$, is the boundary of $M\backslash B$. Here is where we use the the fact that $B$ is a regular coordinate ball. We know there exists a a function $\phi: B' \to B_{r'}(x)$ such that $\phi(B)=B_{r}(x)$ and $\phi(\overline{B})=\overline{B_{r}(x)}$. With this information, we know that there is a neighborhood of the boundary of $B$, namely $B' \cap M\backslash B$, which is homeomorphic to a the closure of a a ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$. So we conclude that $M\backslash B$ is a manifold with boundary. Moreover, the boundary of the manifold is the boundary of B, which is homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}$ because $\phi(\partial B)=\phi(\partial B_r(x))$. Is this proof airtight?

  truth values of the following: $(\forall x)(P(x))$ $(\forall x)(Q(x))$ $(\exists x)(\lnot R(x))$ $(\exists x)(S(x))$ Since we know that this implication is false, it must be of the form $V_0\implies F_0$ Since the rightmost proposition is false, we should negate it. That is to say, $\lnot \{(\forall x)(P(x)) \iff [\lnot(\forall x)(R(x)) \lor (\exists x)(S(x))]\}$ The negation of $P \iff Q$ is $(P \land \lnot Q) \lor (\lnot P \land Q)$, so the above becomes this: $\{(\forall x)(P(x)) \land \lnot[\lnot(\forall x)(R(x)) \lor (\exists x)(S(x))]\} \lor \{\lnot(\forall x)(P(x)) \land [\lnot(\forall x)(R(x)) \lor (\exists x)(S(x))]\}$ $\{(\forall x)(P(x)) \land [(\forall x)(R(x)) \land \lnot (\exists x)(S(x))]\} \lor \{\lnot(\forall x)(P(x)) \land [\lnot(\forall x)(R(x)) \lor (\exists x)(S(x))]\}$ $\{(\forall x)(P(x)) \land [(\forall x)(R(x)) \land (\forall x)(\lnot S(x))]\} \lor \{(\exists x)(\lnot P(x)) \land [(\exists x)(\lnot R(x)) \lor (\exists x)(S(x))]\}$ Now, if you look at the rightmost part of this disjunction, you will see that we got a conjunction. One of the propositions in this conjunction is $(\exists x)(\lnot P(x))$, but that happens to be false because we know that $(\forall x)(P(x))$. So the whole conjunction is false, and by disjunctive syllogism we end up with only the leftmost part of the disjunction: $\{(\forall x)(P(x)) \land [(\forall x)(R(x)) \land (\forall x)(\lnot S(x))]\}$ At the end, we got all of these facts: $(\forall x)(P(x)) \land (\exists x)(\lnot Q(x)) \land (\forall x)(R(x)) \land (\forall x)(\lnot S(x))$ So the answers to the question would be: $(\forall x)(P(x)) \equiv V_0$ $(\forall x)(Q(x)) \equiv  F_0$ $(\exists x)(\lnot R(x)) \equiv  F_0$ $(\exists x)(S(x)) \equiv  F_0$","['logic', 'quantifiers', 'discrete-mathematics']"

509482,Why is a vector space equal to its tangent space for any point?,"I'm self-studying Guillemin and Pollack, but I'm stuck on Problem 3 of section 2. It says that if $V$ is a vector subspace of $\mathbb{R}^N$, then $T_x(V)=V$ if $x\in V$. If $x\in V$, then since $V$ is a manifold, there is a local parametrization $\phi: U\to V$ where $U$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^k$. Without loss of generality, we can require $\phi(0)=x$. Then $T_x(V)$ is defined to be the image of $d\phi_0$ on $\mathbb{R}^k$. An arbitrary element of $T_x(V)$ looks like
$$
d\phi_0(v)=\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{\phi(0+tv)-\phi(0)}{t}=\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{\phi(tv)-x}{t}
$$ but this doesn't seem very useful to show $T_x(V)=V$. What is the right approach?","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

509489,Question about Royden's proof that Lebesgue measure is countably additive.,"In Royden's book, he gives the following book for the proof that Lebesgue measure is countable additive. I will just give a sketch of the proof. Let $\{E_k \}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ be a collection of disjoint measurable sets. We only need to show that $$ m(\cup_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k) \geq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m(E_k) $$ since it follows by countable subadditivtiy that $$ m(\cup_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m(E_k) $$ For any finite subcollection of $\{E_k \}_{k=1}^{\infty}$, it follows by monotonicty that $$ m(\cup_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k) \geq \sum_{k=1}^{n} m(E_k) $$ for each n. What confuses me is the next statement: ""Since the left hand side of the inequality is independent of n it follows that"" $$ m(\cup_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k) \geq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m(E_k) $$ 
as desired. Why is it true that the left hand side of this inequality is independent of n? Here is an example which may help elucidate the proof: consider the partial sums
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2^k} < 1
$$
If we let $n\to \infty$ then we only have
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2^k} \leq 1
$$
Showing that the limit may have equality. Another useful observation is to note that if there is a finite $n$ where the finite sum is equal to the measure of the union of these measurable sets, then the rest of measurable sets must have measure 0, so the equality holds in the limit.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
509510,"C.H. Edwards ""Advanced Calculus of Several Variables"", Problem 3.5 of page 194","In C.H. Edward's Advanced Calculus of Several Variables in the Chapter III in Section 3 on Inverse and Implicit Mapping Theorems question #5 is given as follows: 3.5 Show that the equations
  $$ \sin(x+z)+\log yz^2 = 0, \qquad e^{x+z}+yz=0 $$
  implicitly define $z$ near $-1$ as a function of $(x,y)$ near $(1,1)$. My trouble here is in understanding what is meant by the statement. If I am to consider the collection of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for which both $G_1(x,y,z)= \sin(x+z)+\log yz^2 = 0$  and $G_2(x,y,z)=e^{x+z}+yz=0$ then, if the Jacobian is rank two near $(1,1,-1)$ then we have two (independent) equations and three unknowns hence the implicit solution would have just one free parameter. That is, the implicit solution would seem to be a curve not a surface. Very well, for completeness, let us calculate the Jacobian:
$$ G'(x,y,z) = [\partial_xG|\partial_yG|\partial_zG] = 
\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} \cos(x+z) & 1/y & \cos(x+z)+2/z \\
e^{x+z} & z & e^{x+z}+y \end{array}\right] $$
and evaluate at $(1,1,-1)$ for which clearly $G(1,1,-1)=(0,0)$
$$ G'(1,1,-1) =  
\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 1 & -1 \\
1 & -1 & 2 \end{array}\right] $$
It is clear to me that the matrix above has rank two. Moreover, we can apply the implicit mapping theorem to solve for $x,z$ as a functions of $y$, that is we could find $h_1,h_2$ functions for which $G(h_1(y),y,h_2(y))=(0,0)$ for $y$ near $1$. Or, we could solve for $x,y$ are functions of $z$, that is we could find $h_3,h_4$ such that $G(h_3(z),h_4(z),z)=(0,0)$ for $z$ near $-1$. Finally (thanks to Ted Shifrin's correction) we can also find solution exists for $z,y$ in terms of $x$ exists near $(1,1,-1)$. In short, if I consider both equations at once, I don't see a surface parametrized by $x,y$ near $(1,1,-1)$. Question: does Edwards intend us to consider the equations $G_1=0$ and $G_2=0$ separately? In that case, I can solve for two (distinct) surfaces implicitly given by $G_1(x,y,z)=0$ and $G_2(x,y,z)=0$ respective. The intersection of those surfaces would correspond to the curve which the implicit mapping theorem applied to $G = (G_1,G_2)$ revealed. Am I missing something here?","['multivariable-calculus', 'implicit-function-theorem', 'solution-verification']"
509511,The Zig Zag Lemma in Cohomology,"I´m reading the Zig Zag lemma in Cohomology and i want to prove the exactness of cohomology sequence at $ H^k(A)$ and $H^k(B)$ : A short exact sequence of cochain complexes $ 0 \to A \ \xrightarrow{i} \ B \ \xrightarrow{j} \ C \to 0$ gives rise to a long exact sequence in cohomology: $ ... \ \xrightarrow{j^*} \ H^{k-1}(C) \ \xrightarrow{d^*} \ H^k(A) \ \xrightarrow{i^*} H^k(B) \ \xrightarrow{j^*} H^k(C) \ \xrightarrow{d^*} H^{k+1}(A) \ \xrightarrow{i^*} ...$ where $i^∗$ and $j^∗$ are the maps in cohomology induced from the cochain maps i and j,and $d^∗$ is the connecting homomorphism. I think first i need to prove that $im(d^∗) = ker(i^∗)$ for exactness in $H^k(A)$ . Help please….. I prove the exactness of $H^k(C)$: First I prove that $im( j^*)\subseteq ker (d^*)$.  Let $[b]\in H^k(B) $ then $d^* j^* [b] = d^*[j(b)]$. 
In the recipe above for $d^*$ , we can choose the element in $B^k$ that maps to $j(b)$ to be b. Then $db \in B^{k+1}$. Because b is a cocycle, $db=0$. Following the Zig-Zag diagram we see that since $i(0) = 0 = db$, we must have 
$d^*[j(b)] = [0]$, so $j^*[b]\in ker(d^*)$. The other way, i.e.,
$ker(d^*) \subseteq im(j^*)$:  suppose $d^*[c] = [a]=0$, where 
$[c] \in H^k(C) $, this means that $a=da´$ for some $ a´ \in A^k$.i calculate the $d^*$ again by the diagram and take an element $ b \in B^k$with $j(b) = c$ and $i(a) = db$. Then $b - i(a´)$ is a cocycle in $B^k$ that maps to c under j: $d(b - i(a´)) = db-di(a´) = db - id(a´) = db - ia = 0$,
$j(b - i(a´)) = db-ji(a´) = j(b) = c$
Therefore, $ j^*[b - i(a´)]= [c]$.","['exact-sequence', 'homological-algebra', 'group-cohomology', 'abstract-algebra']"
509526,More elliptic curves for $x^4+y^4+z^4 = 1$?,"( Note: This has been updated to be similar with this MO post .) There are exactly 31 known primitive solutions to, $$a^4+b^4+c^4 = d^4\tag{1}$$ with $d<10^{28}$. Noam Elkies showed that $(1)$ as, $$(p + r)^4 + (p - r)^4 + s^4 = q^4\tag{2}$$ can be completely solved as an intersection of two quadric surfaces, $$-(3 m^2 - 8m + 6) p^2 + 2 (m^2 - 2) p q - 2 m q^2 = (m^2 + 2) r^2\tag{3}$$ $$-4 (m^2 - 2) p^2 + 8 m p q + (m^2 - 2) q^2 = (m^2 + 2) s^2\tag{4}$$ for some constant $m$. Given a known solution to $(1)$, $m$ can be recovered as, $$m = \frac{4p^2-q^2-s^2}{3p^2-2pq+r^2} = \frac{(a+b)^2-c^2-d^2}{a^2+ab+b^2-(a+b)d}\tag5$$ One can reverse-engineer the known solutions and find that there are only eight known rational $m$ of small height such that $(3),(4)$ can be rationally solved,
namely, $$m_k = -\frac{5}{8},\;-\frac{9}{20},\;-\frac{29}{12},\;-\frac{41}{36},\;-\frac{93}{80},\;-\frac{136}{133}$$ and positive, $$m_k = \frac{201}{4},\;\frac{233}{60}$$ with the last one recently found by Andrew Bremner and yielding #21 mentioned in the comments below. The first three $m_k$ give rise to the conditional equations, $(-313+484v+85v^2)^4+(10-586v+68v^2)^4+(2t)^4=(363-204v+357v^2)^4$ $(-15968 + 2334 v+59v^2)^4+(7068 + 3082 v + 10v^2)^4+(2t)^4 = (22628 + 54 v + 159v^2)^4$ $(-11980 + 1673 v + 54v^2)^4+(36 - 2321 v + 3v^2)^4+(t)^4 = (24677 + 203 v + 71v^2 )^4$ with small solutions, $v = -31/467,\;\;-3015/9707,\;\;18247/19530,\;\;30671/229738$ $v = 77/9,\;\;-1022/243,\;\; -50191/8685 $ $v = -2020/127$ For example, factoring the first equation yields the elliptic curve condition, $$22030 + 28849 v - 56158 v^2 + 36941 v^3 - 31790 v^4 = t^2$$ An initial point is $v=-31/467$ from which one can find an infinite more. These small points $v_i$ explain some of the 20 solutions with $d<10^{10}$, while the rest have unwieldy $m$. (The 3rd family might still have rational points that yield $d$ within that range.) Question : What other $m$  is there of small height not in the list of eight above?
