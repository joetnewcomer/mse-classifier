1361463,"Why do we say ""radius"" of convergence?","In an intuitive sense, I have never understood why a power series centered on $c$ cannot converge for some interval like $(c-3,c+2]$. Also, I have had a few professors casually mention that a series converges for a disk in the complex plane, centered on $c$ and with the radius of convergence as its radius. Is this just a deep result that I havent seen yet because I havent taken enough real/complex analysis? Or is there an obvious reason for this. Edit: perhaps a better way to ask my question: why is it that, if the series converges when $x$ is between $c$ and $c+a$, then it also converges for $x$ between $c$ and $c-a$","['power-series', 'complex-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'soft-question']"

1361497,What exactly is the difference between Gateaux derivative and directional derivative?,"The definition of the limit looks very similar between the two derivatives. It seems that directional derivative is the ""amount"" of the function going in the direction of a vector (arrow), whereas the Gateaux derivative is the ""amount"" of a function going in the direction of another function - can someone verify if I have this correctly? Is there anything beyond this? In addition can someone explain why it is necessary to state that the Gateaux derivative is defined on Banach spaces? Let's say I have a set of function that does not form a Banach space, intuitively why would that cause difficulty to define a derivative? And when do I use Gateaux derivative when I am told to calculate the derivative of a function?","['gateaux-derivative', 'calculus', 'limits', 'derivatives']"
1361500,Non combinatorial proof of formula for $n^n$?,"I came across the below identity:
$$
n^n=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\cdot k\cdot n^{n-k-1}
$$
A combinatorial proof of this fact is as follows. Consider the collection of lists of length $n$, where each entry is an integer between 1 and $n$ inclusive. Clearly there are $n^n$ such lists. Let the freshness of a list be the largest $k$ for which the first $k$ entries of the list are distinct. You can then show that the number of lists whose freshness is $k$ is given by $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\cdot k\cdot n^{n-k-1}$, so summing over $k$ gives all $n^n$ possible lists. My question: can anyone think of a proof of this which isn't combinatorial? One that only uses algebraic manipulations, induction, or generating functions?",['combinatorics']

1361524,Matrix Differentiation,"Consider a differentiable function $f: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ and two $p\times 1$ vectors $x$ and $\theta$. Then define a new function as follows.

It's not difficult to see that there is an embedding of $\langle \mathbb{N}, \leq, +, 0 \rangle$ into $\langle \mathbb{N}, \leq, \times, 1 \rangle$; just take the function $h(x) = 2^x$ (or something similar). On the other hand, it's also not very difficult (I think!) to see that the converse does not hold, for, if there were such an embedding $h$, then both $h(1) = 0$ and $h(0) = 0$, meaning that $h$ is not injective (and thus is not actually an embedding). But what about an embedding of $\langle \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}, \leq, \times, 1 \rangle$ into $\langle \mathbb{N}, \leq, +, 0 \rangle$? It seems to me that there is no such embedding as well, but I can't work out an argument showing this impossibility. Clearly the above argument won't work, because it depended on $h(0)$. I thought of trying to show that there is an existential formula that's verified by the latter but not by the former, or conversely a universal formula verified by the former but not by the latter, but couldn't think of anything.

1362144,Smooth isometric embeddings of Riemannian manifolds,"The essence of this question is: Let $(M,g_M)$ and $(N,g_N)$ be Riemannian manifolds. How many different ways are there to embed $M$ isometrically in $N$? In this context, I say the embedding $i_1$ is different from $i_2$ if there is no isometry $\varphi:N\to N$ suct that $i_2=\varphi\circ i_1$. This question is rather easy for specific pairs of manifolds. For example, if $M$ is a line, any embedding has an arc length parametrization, which is just a different name for isometric embedding. Alternatively, let $M$ be Euclidean plane and $N$ Euclidean space. Then for every (smooth) function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, the submanifold $$\{(x,y,z)|y=f(x)\}\subset\mathbb{R}^3,$$equipped with the Riemannian metric inherited from $\mathbb{R}^3$, is isometric to the plane. It is not hard to convince oneself that many of these submanifolds cannot be carried to one another by isometries of Euclidean space. However, there are other simple examples for which I don't know the answer. For example, what happens when $M$ is $S^2$ with the unit sphere metric, and $N$ is Euclidean space? Somehow, the only way I can imagine $S^2$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is by the standard embedding, but I can't find an argument to prove that. Intuitively speaking, it may have something to do with curvature. If so, I guess the answer to the question changes when allowing $C^1$ embeddings. Anything regarding the last example, of the sphere and Euclidean space, would already make me happy. If, by any chance, someone has an answer to a more general case, that would be great.

1362234,"In what way does replacing maximal ideals with prime ideals yield, intuitively, the theory of schemes?","Background: I've only so far seen the most basic aspects of algebraic geometry from Milne's notes on algebraic varieties, and thus my view of the subject as a whole is quite limited. Thus, when answering this question please try and be somewhat concrete or else explain what you're talking about (I have no idea what words like ""cohomology"" or ""derived functor"" have to do with AG :-). The most abstract way of defining an affine variety is to define it as a $k$-ringed space isomorphic to the maximal spectrum $\operatorname{Spm}(A)$ of a (reduced, finitely generated as a $k$-algebra) ring $A$. The usual theory of algebraic sets with preferred embeddings in some affine space $\mathbb A^n$ is the motivating example - namely, take $A=k[V]$ to be the coordinate ring $k[X_1,\dots,X_n]/I(V)$ of some algebraic set $V\subset\mathbb A^n$. Then maximal proper ideals of $k[V]$ correspond to minimal nonempty algebraic subsets - points - and this gives a very intuitive and ""classically geometric"" reason to generalize to the case when $A$ is not a quotient of a polynomial ring. What I do know about affine schemes are their definition - they are $k$-ringed spaces isomorphic to the prime spectrum $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ of some ring $A$. So the difference between schemes and varieties highlights a simple generalization: maximal ideals become prime ideals. This doesn't gel with the geometric theory from before: for instance, the simple case of $\operatorname{Spec}k[X,Y]$ corresponds to the set of irreducible algebraic subsets which doesn't have nearly as immediate a geometric motivation. I understand how allowing nilpotents can be helpful, but can someone explain to me, in simple terms, why this generalization to prime spectra is so good and important?","['algebraic-geometry', 'affine-schemes', 'soft-question']"

My intuition was to use $(0,1) \setminus \mathbb{Q}$. Any neighborhood base of $(0,1) \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ must have elements that exclude each closed (in $\mathbb{R}$) subset of $(0,1) \cap \mathbb{Q}$. For instance, given a sequence of rational numbers $q_n$ which has only rational limit points $L \subset \mathbb{Q}$, our neighborhood base would have to have an element that does not meet $\{q_n : n \geq 0 \} \cup L$. But I was having trouble using this line of thinking to show that such a neighborhood base must be uncountable. *For completeness, my understanding of a neighborhood base of a set $S$ is a collection $N_\alpha$ of neighborhoods of $S$ (i.e. sets containing an open set containing $S$), such that for any neighborhood $N$ of $S$, there is some $\alpha$ such that $N \supset N_\alpha$.",['general-topology']

Therefore, if we let: $$I = \int\limits_{0}^{5} xf(x)dx$$ We can then say that: $$I^2 = \left[\int\limits_{0}^{5} xf(x)dx\right]^2$$ By the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have that: $$I^2 = \left[\int\limits_{0}^{5} xf(x)dx\right]^2 \le \int\limits_{0}^{5} x^2dx * \int\limits_{0}^{5} [f(x)]^2dx$$ We want the maximum value, so I let $\int\limits_{0}^{5} [f(x)]^2dx = 16$: $$I^2 = \left[\int\limits_{0}^{5} xf(x)dx\right]^2 \le \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_{0}^{5} * 16$$
$$I^2 = \left[\int\limits_{0}^{5} xf(x)dx\right]^2 \le \frac{125}{3} * 16 = \frac{125*16}{3}$$ Therefore, I got $I$ to be: $$I = \frac{20\sqrt{15}}{3}$$ However, the answer provided by the solution was $24$.

I've explored various texts and online notes, but they don't seem to cover questions of the pointwise nature of these distributions; typically a distribution's weak limit is found via CLT or saddle-point approximation and it's left at that. As a first effort, it's straightforward to look at the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ (where the increments are $+1$ or $-1$ with equal probability) and use Stirling's approximation to confirm that $$\max_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} |p_t(k+1) - p_t(k)| \approx C/t$$ for some constant $C$ (the $\approx$ indicating omission of lower order terms).  One also finds that this occurs around $\lfloor k\rfloor = \sqrt{t}$, just as one would expect considering the limiting gaussian distribution, $\Phi(x) = (2\pi)^{-1/2} e^{-x^2/2}$, which has $\sup_x \Phi'(x)$ occuring around $x = 1$.

But I don't know what integration techniques to use, so any hints are greatly appreciated. I don't know how to solve for the indefinite integral itself.","['limits', 'definite-integrals', 'integration']"
1363259,Solving differential equations with repeating forcing function,"I am looking for a way to solve differential equation using the Laplace transformation with discontinuous and periodic forcing functions. I found this example and I would like to understand the general solution for this kind of problem. The function has the form: $$u''(t) + \pi^2u(t) = g(t)\\ g(t) = 1, \quad t < c\\ g(t) = 0, \quad t \ge c+1$$ Further they explain: ""The first three terms of the Laplace transform of the homogeneous solution for $u(t):$"" $$ \frac{e^{-2s}}{{s(s^2+\pi^2)}} - \frac{e^{-s}}{{s(s^2+\pi^2)}} + \frac{1}{s(s^2+\pi^2)}$$ Hence I assume that there are more then these three terms. I understand that each term consists of the Laplace transformed unit step function $$\frac{e^{-is}}{s}$$ at $c = 0,1,...$ and 
$$\frac{1}{(s^2+\pi^2)}$$ which looks at first like a sine but it's not (I think). Long story short: how do I calculate the solution of a differential equation such as this with an theoretically infinite amount of forcing terms. Ultimately my goal is to understand how a differential equation evolves given a continuous input.","['simulation', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
1363277,General Solution of $\sin\theta=3\cos\theta$,"I'm a high school level maths student currently working through some exercises for the general solution of trigonometric equations and have come across this one that I am stuck on. Any hints would be much appreciated! Question: Determine the general solution of the trigonometric equation:
  $\sin\theta=3\cos\theta$ So the first thing I think of doing when seeing this is making sure either side has the same ratio. I can do this using co-ratios, so: $\sin\theta=3\sin(90^\circ-\theta)$ $\sin\theta=3\cos\theta$ From here I get stuck; there are no values to compute a reference angle with. The textbook gives the solution as: $\theta=71.6^\circ+k\cdot 180^\circ, k\in\mathbb{Z}$ Can anyone give me a hint? Thanks in advance! -Shaun",['trigonometry']
