278600,Lower bounds on the number of elements in Sylow subgroups,"Let $p$ be a prime and $n \geq 1$ some integer. Furthermore, let $G$ be a finite group where $p$-Sylow subgroups have order $p^n$. Denote by $n_p(G)$ the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$. Denote the number of elements in the union of all Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ by $f_p(G)$. I am interested in finding lower bounds for $f_p(G)$ that do not depend on the group $G$, but only on $n_p(G)$, the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups. By Sylow's theorem, we know that $n_p(G) = kp + 1$ for some integer $k \geq 0$. If $k = 0$, then it is clear that $f_p(G) = p^n$. If $k = 1$, we can show that $f_p(G) = p^{n+1}$. Furthermore, if $k > 1$, then by a theorem of Miller (see this question ) we have $f_p(G) > p^{n+1}$, so by Frobenius theorem [*] $f_p(G) \geq p^{n+1} + p^n$. We can also improve this with Frobenius theorem to $f_p(G) \geq 2p^{n+1} - p^n$ by noticing that the number $f_p(G) - 1$ is divisible by $p-1$. My question is this: Can we find a better lower bound for $f_p(G)$ when $k > 1$? I guess it would probably make sense that when $G$ has many Sylow subgroups, then there are many distinct elements among the subgroups. Thus I am also interested in the following question: Can we show that $f_p(G) \rightarrow \infty$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$? To make this precise, what I am asking here is for a function $g$ satisfying the following: For any group $G$ with Sylow $p$-subgroups of order $p^n$ and $n_p(G) = kp + 1$, we have $f_p(G) \geq g(k)$. $g(k) \rightarrow \infty$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$ Of course, for both questions the case $n = 1$ is easy, because then we know the value of $f_p(G)$ precisely. If $n = 1$, then $f_p(G) = (kp+1)(p-1)+1$ so for both questions we have a positive answer. I think the following example shows that $f_p(G)$ gets arbitrarily large values. By Dirichlet's theorem, there exist arbitrarily large primes $q$ such that $q \equiv 1 \mod{p}$. Then in a direct product $G = C_{p^{n-1}} \times H$, where $H$ is a non-abelian group of order $pq$, the Sylow subgroups of $G$ have $C_{p^{n-1}}$ as their common intersection. There are exactly $q$ Sylow $p$-subgroups, because otherwise $G$ would be nilpotent but its subgroup $H$ is not. Therefore the number of elements in the $p$-Sylow subgroups is $f_p(G) = q(p^{n} - p^{n-1}) + p^{n-1}$, and this goes to infinity as $q$ goes to infinity. [*] Frobenius' Theorem says that when $G$ is a finite group with order divisible by $k$, the number of solutions to $x^k = 1$ in $G$ is a multiple of $k$. It is easy to see that $f_p(G)$ is the number of solutions to $x^{p^n} = 1$ in $G$. LATER EDIT: Okay, the second question is not so difficult if I have this right. Any Sylow $p$-subgroup consists of $p^n$ elements from the $f_p(G)$ elements in the union, so we have the inequality $f_p(G)^{p^n} \geq n_p(G) = kp + 1$, and thus $$f_p(G) \geq (kp+1)^{p^{-n}}$$ which goes to infinity as $k \rightarrow \infty$. For huge $k$ this is better than the lower bound $f_p(G) \geq 2p^{n+1} - p^n$. However, this is an extremely weak bound and not so interesting, it seems to me useful only for showing that $f_p(G) \rightarrow \infty$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Give an example of such $\mu$. If the variables have a density then clearly we can take the lebesgue measure, but this is not always the case. So, is there a $\mu$ for which this is always true (like $P$ itself since $\sigma(X) \subset \mathcal{F}$)? 2)Later on it states that $P^{x,y}$, the joint law is not always absolutely continuous w.r.t. the product measure $\mu \times \mu$.

278798,Automorphism group of the elliptic curve $y^2 + y = x^3$,"Consider the elliptic curve $E : y^2+y = x^3$ over $\overline{\mathbb{F}_2}$. It has the biggest automorphism group $G$ among all elliptic curves, namely with order $24$. What is the structure of $G$? Which of the 15 groups of order 24 is it? There is a subgroup consisting of those automorphisms of the form $x \mapsto ux, y \mapsto y+t$ where $u \in \mathbb{F}_4^*, t \in \mathbb{F}_2$. It is abelian and has order $6$, hence isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/6$. The other automorphisms have the form $x \mapsto ux+r, y \mapsto y+r^{-1} ux + t$ for some $t \in \mathbb{F}_4 \setminus \mathbb{F}_2$ and $u,r \in \mathbb{F}_4^*$.

278803,One of balls and urns,"This is a question I came up with while reading the description of an algorithm for solving a classic puzzle . I'm asking this just to satisfy my own curiosity and maybe learn some useful things from combinatorics. There's many ways to model the problem, but let's use balls and urns: Let's say that you have 4 distinguishable urns (let's call them $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$) and 15 balls of 4 distinguishable types (let's call them $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$) such that you have 4 balls of each of $(a, b, c)$ and 3 $d$ balls. As you can see, one (natural) way of placing the balls in the urns is putting the four a's in A, the four b's in B, and so on. So far so good. Now here's the complication I don't know how to deal with: let's assume that the four urns have a fixed capacity to hold a maximum of four balls. So, you can notice that no matter how you divide the balls in the urns, there will always be 3 urns completely full, and one with a single ""empty"" space. The question is, how many different ways are there to divide the balls in the urns? There's a number in the URL I referenced in the first paragraph, and I guess I could verify it by writing a program to do it by brute force, but I'd like to know if there's a way to tackle this purely with mathematical reasoning. In addition, how about if we generalize the problem? Instead of 4 urns, we have $X$ urns, and we have $K$ balls of $X$ types (feel free to assume anything you want for the rest of the details of the general problem). Thanks. Edit 1: In case it helps, here's a few more details. As you can gather from the link, this problem is somewhat related to the 15-puzzle . Think of the urns as the rows in the puzzle. Think of the balls as the tiles with the numbers 1 to 15. A ""type"" of ball represents the row a certain tile belongs to; for example, tiles 1 to 4 belong to row 1 (so they're balls of type $a$), tiles 5 to 8 belong to row 2 (they're balls of type $b$), etc. The number is in the URL under the section ""WK (Walking Distance)"", in the paragraph that says ""The number of distinct tables is..."". Also, you could certainly represent this as having 5 types of balls, and then you have 16 balls (4 of type $a$, 4 $b$, 4 $c$, 3 $d$ and 1 $e$). The question remains, how many ways are there to put all the balls inside the four urns, considering their capacities?",['combinatorics']

I am trying to use this to figure out $\chi(D)$ (or some components in the sum defining it), and am naturally led to the question of what can be said about the arithmetic genus $p_a$. In the case of curves, there is the degree-genus formula which allows one to compute the genus of a curve on a plane. Is there an analogous formula for the genus of a surface given by an equation in a three dimensional space? If not, what methods are there to compute $p_a$?

Specifically, I'm curious if excellent practicioners will typically VISUALIZE such statements in any sort of way that doesn't involve mentally picturing the literal statement with its syntax as written above. For example, are Venn or Euler Diagrams typically a good way to go about things, or is that a bad idea in the long-run? Personally, I know that with Analysis/Group Theory/Topology I have been successful in finding rough visualizations of pretty much every concept involved (with the understanding that mental pictures are not LITERAL representations of the relevant concepts and in fact can often be quite misleading if one is not careful with them); however, with logic I am finding this more difficult since the mathematical objects in question seem in many ways to be largely, explicitly syntactical. What this means is that the more I rougly convert formal statements into ""intuitive"" pictures, the more those intuitive pictures start to exactly resemble a specific interpretation which gets in the way of those sentences being explictly syntactical in nature. As a consequence of this mess, I find myself getting confused in lacking basic intuitions over whether elementary statements are true or false before I attempt to prove them, unlike in other mathematical subjects.

This seems to be just the union of a countable number of disjoint intervals (which we can generate from the basis elements of the standard topology).  To be more explicit, suppose we have a set in the K topology $(0,1)\backslash K$.  We can generate this open set with  $\cup_{n\in\mathbb{Z+}} (\frac{1}{n+1},\frac{1}{n})$, where each of the open sets $(\frac{1}{n+1},\frac{1}{n})$ is in the basis for the standard topology.  Also, since the basis elements of the standard topology are a subset of the K-topology's basis elements, any open set the standard topology generates can also be generated by the K-topology.

Note that the interior of $V(I)$ is contained in $V(J)$ and hence the closure of the interior of $V(I)$ is contained in $V(J)$.

The most important special case for me is when $V(J) = \emptyset$.

Is it a proven fact that no pure algebraic proof is possible? And so if I assume we are relying on the topological properties of $R$ and $C$ to prove the theorem, then given any arbitrary field how can one test whether it is algebraically closed or not? Again in Wikipedia I found this result stated, ""The classic example is the theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic. Categoricity does not say that all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0 as large as the complex numbers C are the same as C; it only asserts that they are isomorphic as fields to C. It follows that although the completed p-adic closures Cp are all isomorphic as fields to C, they may (and in fact do) have completely different topological and analytic properties."" so i now want to rephrase my question as, given any field with different topological properties than C and which is in no simple way isomorphic to $C$ how can we generalize the proof of FTA to check whether FTA is valid on those fields? And what about characteristic p fields? i can see an example that algebraic closure of $F_p((t))$ is an example of infinite, characteristic p field that is by construction closed, but if we had in our arsenal other ways to describe the field and suppress the fact that it is algebraic closure of another field then how can one prove that it is algebraically closed?

Now look at the case in which $G=U(n)$ (the unitary group): the quotient $U(n)/T_{n}$ is the flag variety (why? I haven't understood the reason why $GL(n,\mathbb{C})/B_{n} \simeq U(n)/T_{n} $, where $B_{n}$ is the Borel subgroup of upper-triangular non singular matrix) and the Bruhat decomposition for flag variety implies that there are $|W|$ cells of even dimensions. 
I tried also, under a good suggest, to prove this claim by induction on $n$. 
Prop.
$U(n)/T_{n}$ si decompone in $|W|$ celle di dimensione pari.
( incorrect / incomplete) Proof
Base of induction: $U(1)/S^{1}\simeq pt$: a 0-cell.
Inductive hypothesis: we suppose that $U(n-1)/T_{n-1}= e^{0} \cup \cdots e^{2n-1}$. Now we have to prove that $U(n)/T_{n}= e^{0} \cup \cdots \cup e^{2n}$. So we can use the double quotient theorem: $(U(n)/T_{n})/(U(n-1)/T_{n-1}) \simeq S^{2n-1}/S^{1} = \mathbb{C}P^{n}$ (because $U(n)/U(n-1)= S^{2n-1}$ and $T_{n}/T_{n-1}=S^{1}$). But is a well-know fact that $\mathbb{C}P^{n}= e^{0} \cup \cdots \cup e^{2n}$.

$[1, -1]$ and $ [ {-1 \over 4}, {-1 \over 16} ]$. The Hessian matrix for function $f$ is: $$
\nabla^2 f =

$x > {9 \over 24}$ Looking at each of the critical points, using Sylvester's criterion we see that $det(\nabla^2 f(1,-1)) = 15$, which is positive, therefore $[1,-1]$ is a local minimum $f$ and $det(\nabla^2 f({-1 \over 4}, {-1 \over 16})) = {6 \over 4} * 4 - 9 = -3$, which is negative, therefore $[{-1 \over 4}, {-1 \over 16}]$ is a local maximum of $f$ Is this result correct?","['optimization', 'multivariable-calculus']"

279437,Is it necessary to have a normed space for the Heine-Borel-Property to hold?,"The Heine-Borel-Property says: A subset M is compact iff it is closed and bounded. It is well known that the euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ has this property. In a narrower sense I found the following. A normed space $X$ is finite-dimensional iff it obeys the Heine-Borel-Property. I was wondering if the property of the space $X$ to have a norm or a metric is necessary. In the proofs I found they are all based on balls, convergence and other notions where norms or metrics are involved. But in the statement of the H-B-Property, all concepts could be defined without a reference to a norm or a metric. For example, let $K$ be a complete, ordered field (like $\mathbb{R}$), then we could define the sets $(a,b) := \{ x : a < x < b \}$ and consider the topology $\tau$ generated by the collection of all such sets. So compactness could be defined as usual by requiring a compact set to have a finite open-cover, boundedness of a set $M$ could be defined as existence of a set $(a,b)$ with $M \subseteq (a,b)$ and closedness as $M$ is closed iff $K \setminus M$ is open, i.e. $K \setminus M \in \tau$. So now could the Heine-Borel-Property be proved for $K$? I don't find any proofs that doesn't use concepts like norm or metric (even the concept of limit could be defined without these concepts, like $x$ is limit point of set $M$ iff for every set $U$ with $x \in U$ if holds that $M \cap U \ne \emptyset$).

(Here, $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$ with respect to composition of functions.) The answer, as it turns out, is negative, because such a bijection is monotonic, which implies that the derivative cannot be bijective. There seem to be no such problems if we instead search for a bijection $f:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ such that $f'=f^{-1}$ , so the following variation of the question seems interesting: Does there exist a differentiable bijection $f:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ such that $f'=f^{-1}$ ? ( Edit: as mentioned at the end of this question, the question of existence has been resolved. Is the solution unique?) Here's the first idea: if there is a function $f:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ such that $f'(x)=f^{-1}(x)$ holds for all $x\in(0,\infty)$ , then $$f'(f(x))=f^{-1}(f(x))=x$$ also must hold for all $x$ , since $f$ is bijective. This immediately reminds us of the chain rule, so we multiply by $f'(x)$ to yield $$f'(f(x))f'(x)=xf'(x)$$ which is equivalent to $$f'(f(x))f'(x)=xf'(x)+f(x)-f(x).$$ This implies (integrate from $1$ to $x$ , for instance) that there is a primitive function $F$ of $f$ such that $$f(f(x)) = x f(x) - F(x)$$ holds for all $x\in(0,\infty)$ , so we may try solving this equation instead. I don't know if this is any easier than the original problem, though. Maybe some kind of fixed point principle might work to show existence? It would be very nice if it turns out that there is a nice characterization of such functions. Edit: At the link pointed out by Christian Blatter in the comments there is an explicit solution ( $f(x)=\frac{x^\phi}{\phi^{\phi-1}}$ , where $\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2}$ is the golden ratio), so maybe it would also be interesting to know: Is this solution unique?",['analysis']
