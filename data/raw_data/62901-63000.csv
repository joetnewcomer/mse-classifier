718157,"Normed linear space with two norms that are not equivalent, one is complete, what about the other?","I have been searching for an answer to the following question: Given a normed linear space $V$ and two norms that are not equivalent, but $\exists K\in\mathbf{R}$ such that $\|v\|_1\leq K\|v\|_2$ for all $v\in V$. We know that $(V,\|\cdot\|_2)$ is complete, i.e. a Banach space. Is $(V,\|\cdot\|_1)$ also complete? Some related questions posted so far are: (i) Example of two norms on same space, non-equivalent, with one dominating the other (ii) If two normed spaces are Lipschitz equivalent, then one if complete iff the other is In (i) there is a good example from julien, but I am unable to relate it to Cauchy sequences.

718175,How many ways to arrange the numbers $1...n$ such that..,"Let $\{1...n\}$ and $k$, a number between $1\le k \le n$.
  How many permutations are there for the set, where $k$ is smaller than all the number to it's right. My thought: We have to place $k$ at the cell number $k$. Then, we have $(k-1)!$ permutations for the smaller numbers and $(n-k)!$ for the greater numbers. All in all, we have: $(k-1)!(n-k)!$ Somehow, the right answer is:
$$\left( {\matrix{

718192,Geometric interpretation and computation of the Normal bundle,"My question concern the definition, geometric meaning, and usage of the normal bundle in algebraic geometry. Let $X$ be a nonsingular variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ , and $Y\subseteq X$ a nonsingular closed subvariety. Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the sheaf of ideals defined by the closed embedding $i: Y \hookrightarrow X$ , and consider the sheaf $\mathcal{C}_{Y/X}=: \mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^{2}$ . We define the normal sheaf of $Y$ in $X$ to be $\mathcal{N}_{Y/X}=:\mathsf{Hom}(\mathcal{C}_{Y/X},\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ . This definition can be found on Hartshorne's ""Algebraic Geometry"". Recently I came across some concrete examples of normal bundles that I cannot understand. $\mathbf{(1)}$ Let $C$ be a nonsingular curve of degree $2$ and genus $0$ in $\mathbb{P}^{3}_{k}$ . with $k$ an algebraically closed field. It can be proven that for any such curve, there exists a quadric $Q$ in $\mathbb{P}^{3}_{k}$ such that $C$ lies on $Q$ . Then $\mathcal{N}_{C/Q}=\mathcal{O}_{C}(1)$ , and $\mathcal{N}_{S}|_{C}=\mathcal{O}_{C}(2)$ . $\mathbf{(2)}$ Let $X$ a nonsingular irreducible cubic surface in $\mathbb{P}^{3}_{k}$ , with $k$ an algebraically closed field. Let $H$ the hyperplane section of $X$ . It can be proven that there exists a nonsingular irreducible curve $C\in |4H+2L|$ of degree $14$ and genus $24$ , for a line $L$ on $X$ . Then $\mathcal{N}_{C/X}=\mathcal{O}_{C}(C)$ , and $\mathcal{N}_{X}=\mathcal{O}_{X}(3)$ . The geometrical meaning of the twisting sheaf, and the Picard group construction are very clear to me. I don't understand how can normal sheaves be computed in the examples presented above. However, rather than focusing on those two cases, I would like to understand the nature of the normal sheaf - i.e. what does it say about the varieties? Is there a more agile definition? How do normal sheaves relate to twisting sheaves? How can they be computed? I am mostly interested in the case of regular projective schemes of low dimension, over an algebraically closed field. Simple examples are also welcome.","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'algebraic-curves']"
718197,Is the maximum-likelihood estimation notation formally correct?,"I just saw from the Wikipedia's entry on Maximum likelihood, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood , the formula $\mathcal{L}(\theta\,|\,x_1,\ldots,x_n) = f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\;|\;\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i|\theta).$ Could someone explain if this is formally correct?

718264,What about $\ell^1$ with pointwise multiplication,"This question occurred to me after reading this thread . I was working on finding an example of a Banach algebra.

I believe I even proved that $\ell^1 (\mathbb N)$ is closed with respect to pointwise multiplication and that the norm is submultiplicative. Is it really possible that $\ell^1 (\mathbb N)$ can be turned into a Banach algebra in two ways, by convolution and by pointwise multiplication, or is there necessarily a mistake in my proof?

It is easy to verify that $Z(G) \triangleleft G$. $\text{Inn}(G)$ is the inner automorphism group of $G$. As a consequence of the first isomorphism theorem, we have
$$G / Z(G) \cong \text{Inn}(G).$$ 
The homomorphism involved here is defined as $a \in G \mapsto \sigma_{a} \in \text{Inn}(G)$ where $\sigma_{a}$ is a bijection from $G$ to $G$ with $\sigma_{a}(x) = axa^{-1}$.

x(t)=\frac1\mu\left(C+\int_\tau^t \mu(s)h(s)\,ds\,\right).

718956,Incorrect logic in popular proof of the irrationality of $\sqrt2$?,"A popular proof of the irrationality of $\sqrt2$ is to first assume that the number is rational. This means that $\sqrt2=a/b$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Another assumption is that $a$ and $b$ are coprime. It turns out that this leads to a contradiction. And the conclusion is that $\sqrt2$ is not rational (because the assumption of rationality led to a contradiction). But what about the second assumption? Logically, the conclusion could also be that $a$ and $b$ are not coprime.. How can this be resolved? Edit: Thank you all for your comments. It cleared up my mind. Three aspects of this kind of proof are: mathematical, logical, and didactical. Mathematically, it is the case that any rational number can be written as a fraction with coprime numerator and denominator. But this point is often described in a way that is either literally a logical assumption, or in a way that is natural to interpret as a hidden logical assumption. In this case, the proof will have a flawed logic, because any of the two assumptions could be the cause of the contradiction. Didactically, this can cause confusion in the mind of the student, who might not be so accepting of the proofs conclusion. I used to be that student. So, how to resolve it? Many of you provided explanations on the mathematical aspect, which are all correct. But my main point is not of not understanding the proof, but of the use of flawed logic which leads to not understanding the proof. I am sure that a lot of teachers think or say something along the lines of WLOG, but for many students, this makes the proof weaker, because it is not so convincing. When we present this proof to our students, we need to have this in mind. Thank you.",['real-analysis']

I did read this similar question beforehand, but it didn't help me to complete this task Use Fourier series for computing $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(2n-1)^2}$ . My approach : I will merely write down the results, I did all the calculations by hand on paper and then double-checked by using Mathematica. Writing out the entire process would only make this post blow up in length further. To get the Fourier Coefficients I did integrate using only the definition as above, I first did look at the case for $n=0$. I got $$ c_0 = \frac{1}{2}$$
for the case $ n \neq 0$ I applied integration by parts two times and after a pretty tedious process I did end up with $$c_n = \frac{ in \cos (n \pi)}{4n^2-1}= \frac{in (-1)^n}{4n^2-1} $$
Which was a very satisfying result, because now I have $$|c_n|^2 = \frac{n^2}{(4n^2-1)^2}$$which somewhat looks very close to what I am supposed to get, except for that annoying $n^2$ in the numerator. Finally evaluating $$ \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{- \pi}^\pi |f(x)|^2dx = \frac{1}{32}(8+ \pi^2)$$ Doubts and Questions : I have a feeling that my method of integrating was wrong, because I did not make use of $f$ being even which would mean that $f(-x)=f(x)$ and therefore integration from $- \pi, \pi$ would result to be twice the original integral with bounds from 0 to $2 \pi$ I did not make use of the statement $f$ is even, because when I plot $f$ it does not look even at all to me, so I wonder about this statement in general. I suppose it has something to do with the definitions of Fourier Coefficients and their application to $A$-periodical Functions. If the above procedure would happen to be right, how could I get the final statement? More precisely formulated, how would I possible get from $$ \sum_{- \infty}^{+ \infty} \frac{n^2}{(4n^2-1)^2}$$ to the Sum that starts from $1$ and ends at $\infty$ ?","['fourier-series', 'summation', 'calculus', 'self-learning']"

719045,Zeros/poles at Laplace and at Fourier Transform,"I recently started ""relearning"" the Laplace transform, and I noticed something. It seems to me that the intuitive idea of poles and zeros is different between these two transforms! For example, in case of Fourier transform, we can write something like this for the input signal of the system: let the input be a complex sinusoid $e^{j \omega_0 t}$, then
$$y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}d\tau \, h(\tau)x(t-\tau)=e^{j \omega_0 t} \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}d\tau \, h(\tau)e^{-j \omega_0 \tau}=e^{j \omega_0 t} \cdot H(\omega_0),$$
where $H(\omega_0)$ is the Fourier transform of the impulse response of the system $h(t)$ on a frequency $\omega_0$.
The same thing can be seen in frequency domain, where Dirac distribution $2 \pi \delta(\omega-\omega_0)$ essentially ""probes"" the transfer function $H(\omega)$ at $\omega=\omega_0$. In other words, the transfer function is acting upon the complex sinusoid and changes it accordingly. Zeros and poles in this case come naturally as those values of frequency where transfer function zeroes out or explodes. Hence, when we multiply $H(\omega)$ with a complex sinusoid at one of these frequencies, the result is clearly visible; the sinusoid either disappears or becomes really big (infinite). Now, let's focus on the Laplace transform; I am not managing to gain the same insight here. As far as the transfer function $H(s)$ is concerned, zeros and poles are still the same thing: characteristic values of $s$ where the function zeroes out or explodes, but similarity ends here; if I choose a causal complex sinusoid as an input of a causal system, i.e. $e^{s_0t}u(t)$, I can write $$y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}d\tau \, h(\tau)x(t-\tau)=e^{s_0t} \cdot \int_{0}^{t}d\tau \, h(\tau)e^{-s_0\tau} \neq e^{s_0t} \cdot H(s_0),$$
so, in short, I can't apply the same logic with zeros/poles as I did with Fourier transform. It's similar if I look at the situation in the $s$-domain
$$Y(s)=H(s) \cdot \frac{1}{s+s_0,}$$
and it's obvious that it's not like $H(s)$ ""probes"" the complex sinusoid $e^{s_0t}u(t)$ and changes only its amplitude/phase, as was the case with Fourier transform. So, my conclusion is that, if I feed the system with signal $e^{s_zt}$, where $s_z$-value is the value where, for example, $H(s)=0$, I can't just say ""$H(s)$ is going to act upon it and change it accordingly - in this case, nullify it"". The same conclusion goes for poles. My question is, how should I interpret the poles and zeros of the Laplace transform?

719106,Infinite Sequences on Arbitrary Field - Countable Basis?,"Please note that this is a homework question, I've been thinking about this for a couple days and I haven't had much luck! Thought I'd get some other input. Let $V$ be the vector space of all infinite sequences with entries in an arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$ .  (The goal is to show it doesn't have a countable basis) First show that if $V$ admits a countable basis then there is a nested sequence of subspaces $W_{1} \subset W_{2} \subset ...$ such that $dim(W_{j}) = j$ and $V = \cup W_{j}$ . This proof was fairly obvious because you are given the fact that there is a countable basis so you can just take spans.  However, then ext part says We can represent an infinite sequence as a concatenation of sequences $(s_{2}, ... )$ where $s_{j}$ is a sequence of length $j$ .  For each $j \geq 2$ show that there exists a sequence $S_{j}$ with length $j$ and the property that $s_{j} = S_{j} \rightarrow (s_{2}, ... S_{j}, .. ) \not\in W_{j-1}$ For me what this is trying to get at that given any element in your vector space you can find a sequence of length $j$ such that if you shove it in the $j$ th spot of the sequence representation of the element in the vector space than it isn't in $W_{j-1}$ . My first idea was thinking about picking our ""countable basis""(which we know doesn't exist) to be the element whose ith entry is 1 and the rest is 0.  Then we could just pick up a diagonal argument to ensure that it wouldn't be in $W_{j-1}$ but I can't quite wrap my head about how to apply the same idea to an arbitrary countable basis where we don't know what the elements look like! Lastly it is to show that there's an element which doesn't belong to any of the $W_{j}$ which follows from the above just by picking all those finite length sequences and putting them together. So what gives, I feel as though I'm getting too focused around the idea that I know this not to be the case that I haven't been able to quite get it. Thanks!","['linear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

Let, $f(x) ≥ 0$, $f'(x) ≤ 0$ and $f''(x) ≤ f(x)$ for all $x ≥ 0$. Show that, $f'(0) ≥ -√2$. I am telling you what I did. First, I noted that $-√2$ is somehow a bit odd to suddenly appear in such a situation, but then realized that $-√2$ is the minimum value of a function of the form $(sinx + cosx)$ ! This realization caused me to think of a function $f(x)$ such that it is decreasing (as $f'(x) ≤ 0$), and trigonometric. And, the words ""twice differentiable"" excited me: we know that a trigonometric sine or cosine function gives back somewhat the negative of the original function on twice differentiation. So, by careful choice, I selected the function $f(x) = \cos p√2x - \sin p√2x$, where $p$ is a real number belonging to $[0, 1]$. Then, $f'(x) = -p√2(\sin p√2x + \cos p√2x)$, which is clearly $≤ 0$ (and hence satisfies the problem.) We also find that $f'(0) = -p√2$ and as $1 ≥ p ≥ 0$, $-√2 ≤ p√2 ≤ 0$ (hence shown!) You may note that for this function, $f''(x) = -2p²f(x) ≤ f(x)$, equality holding if $p = 0$ or $f(x) = 0$. Now, is my method correct? I, actually, do not know how to work with these inequalities in derivatives so I just used my intuition to get this function and hopefully it should work!","['inequality', 'calculus', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
719433,How to count matrices with rows and columns with an odd number of ones?,"I proved that $\displaystyle \left(\sum_{k\, \rm odd}\binom{m}{k}\right)^{n-1}=\left(\sum_{k\;{\rm odd}}\binom{n}{k}\right)^{m-1}$ by counting matrices of size $n\times m$ with entries in $\{0,1\}$ such that the sum of columns and rows is odd. One can show that this can only happen if $m,n$ share the same parity. What are other ways of counting such matrices? By Davids observation, this is just $2^{(m-1)\times (n-1)}$, which suggests a better counting argument might be produced. Maybe something in the lines of my argument, but completing the $n-1\times m-1$ matrix freely with $1$s and $0$s, and showing its final rows and column may be completed so that it is a solution. I'll think about it. Proof From $\sum_i a_{ij}=1\mod 2,\sum_j a_{ij}=1\mod 2$, we get $$\sum_i\sum_j a_{ij}=m\equiv n=\sum_j\sum_i a_{ij}\mod 2$$ so that $m,n$ have the same parity. It follows in particular that if a matrix with uneven columns and rows has all rows with an odd number of ones, there exists at least one column with an even number of $1$s. To prove the formula, we can produce an even number of ones in a bitstring of length $m$ in $\sum_{k\;\rm odd}\binom{m}{k}$ ways. Take the first $n-1$ rows and complete so that each has an odd number of ones. I claim the last row may be completed so that every column also has an odd number of ones. Since the matrix built so far is $n-1\times m$; the first observation says there is a column with an even number of ones, for $m,n-1$ have opposite parity. Put a $1$, to obtain an $n-1\times m-1$ matrix, call it $M$. If $M$ has all columns with an odd number of $1$s, we're done, else there is some column with an even number of $1$s. Insert a $1$ in the corresponding place in the $n$-th row. Then we obtain an $n-1\times m-2$ matrix $M'$ with an odd number of $1$ in the rows (because we deleted $2$ columns, and our original rows had an odd number of ones), so there must exist a column with an even number of $1$s, thus we insert another $1$. Continuing, we see the algorithm stops at an odd numbers of $1$ always, and the proof is complete. The argument is of course symmetric in $m$ and $n$, since the method provides with any matrix of your liking, so the equation follows.","['summation', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"
719441,What is a field of definition of a morphism?,"An algebraic variety $X$ over a field $K$ is a $K$-scheme integral separated and of finite

719442,Evaluating trigonometric integral using residues,"I am trying to evaluate for real positive $\alpha,\beta$ $$\int_{0}^{\infty}\arctan\left(\frac{\alpha}{x}\right)\sin(\beta x)dx$$ using a hint to consider $$\int \log\left(\frac{z+ia}{z}\right) e^{ibz}dz$$ with a branch cut from $0$ to $z=-ia$. However, I am having a lot of difficulty understanding why this hint is useful. I have tried to construct a semicircle contour on the upper halfplane with a smaller semicircle to avoid the point $z=0$ and I have having difficulty on a couple of fronts. First, I cannot seem to conclude that when my smaller semi circle tends to zero, that this section of the contour contributes nothing to the integral, but based on past experience I don't see why it is not true. However, even if I suppose the upper and lower semi circle arcs do not contribute to the integral in the limit, I am left with (since there are no poles in my contour) $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \log\left(\frac{x+i\alpha}{x}\right) e^{i\beta x}dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\log\left(\frac{x+i\alpha}{x}\right)(\cos(\beta x) + i\sin(\beta x))dx = 0.$$ From here, it seems like I need to evaluate either

\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \log\left(\frac{x+i\alpha}{x}\right)\cos(\beta x)dx \qquad (1)

If I were to accomplish that, since $\log((x+i\alpha)/x))$ is not an odd or even function, I don't know how I could further reduce my limits of integration to $0$ to $\infty$ to match the limits of integration of my original integral. Even further still, if I were to manage all of this, I don't see how it would introduce a $\arctan(\alpha/x)$ into the expression so I can arrive at an answer.

For example, $[g(x)\partial]^2=g(x)[g'(x)+g(x)\partial]\partial$ and it gets worse for higher orders. Also, where can I find the list of identities such as $e^{a\partial}f(x)=f(a+x)$?

 f(x,y) =
  \begin{cases}
   \frac{\sin(x^2 + y^2)}{x^2 + y^2} & \text{if } (x,y) \ne (0,0) \\
   1       & \text{if } (x,y) = (0,0)
  \end{cases}
$$ Is $f$ diff'ble at $(x,y) = (0,0)$? Here is what I have: By definition, $f(x,y)$ is diff'ble at $(0,0)$ if $$ \lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} f(x,y)= \frac{f(x,y) - [f(0,0) + f_{x}(0,0)(x-0) + f_{y}(0,0)(y-0)]}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = 0\tag{*}$$ Since $f(x,y)$ is piecewise, $f_{x}(0,0)$ and $f_{y}(0,0)$ is derived from 1st principles: So, $$\begin{align}f_{x}(0,0) &= \lim_{h \to 0}  \frac{\frac{\sin((0+h)^2 + (0)^2)}{(0+h)^2 + (0)^2} - f_{x}(0,0)}{h} \\
&=  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{\sin(h^2)}{h^2} - 1}{h}\\
&=  \lim_{h \to 0}  \frac{\sin(h^2) - h^2}{h^3} \\
&=  \lim_{h \to 0}  \frac{2h \cos(h^2) - 2h}{3h^2}\end{align} $$ by L'Hopital's rule, apply this twice more I can see that the limit is $0$. Similarly, $f_y(0,0)$ is derived the same way. Then from $(*)$, I have: $$f_{x}(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0}  \frac{\frac{\sin(x^2 + y^2)}{x^2 + y^2} - 1}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} $$ From here I haven't had luck trying to get this to $0$. So instead, I try to make it easier. Since $f_x(0,0)$ and $f_y(0,0)$ exist we must evaluate whether $f_x(x,y)$ is continuous at $(x,y)=(0,0)$ i.e. if $$\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)}  \frac{\sin(x^2 + y^2)}{x^2 + y^2} = 1 $$ then  $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(0,0)$. So letting $u = x^2 + y^2$, $$\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)}  \frac{\sin(x^2 + y^2)}{x^2 + y^2} = \lim_{ (x,y) \to (0,0)}  \frac{\sin(u)}{u} = 1 $$ by L'Hopital once more. Therefore, $f$ is differentiable at (0,0). I feel like I am perhaps not completely justifying this, because I take a short cut - but is it valid? Should I perhaps use a epsilon-delta proof?

Since $\varnothing \in \{\varnothing\}$ , it follows that the empty set can be considered a member of another set. Namely, $(\forall A)(\varnothing \in A) $. Or that's what I assume. If it's true, some weird things happen. Putting it shortly, since the empty set will be an element of every set, the axiom of pairing won't be true: For every sets $a$ and $b$, a set $A$ will also contain the empty set. So (following Halmos' definition) ""for any two sets there exists a set that contains both of them and nothing else"" won't be true because a third element $\varnothing $ will always be present. The same reasoning can be applied to the idea of a singleton: I think it's not possible for a set of a single element to exist if there's always an empty set right there, next to the so-called ""unique element"". Could be wrong about this one, too. Any further explanation of the problems that arise will be, in my opinion, wasted time if the premise that caused them is false, so I'll leave it there until someone proves me that the statement is right.

$rp(i) = rj$ Can someone please help me, I am stuck?  Thank you.","['permutations', 'symmetric-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
719925,Continuity of integral of continuous functions,"Let $f\in L^1(\mathbb{R})$. Show that the function $g$ defined on $\mathbb{R}$ by 
$$ g(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \sin(xy)f(y)dy$$
is well defined and continuous on the real line. So I want to prove that if $x_n \rightarrow x$ then $g(x_n) \rightarrow g(x)$.
Expanding this $$ \left|\lim_n \int_{\mathbb{R}} \sin(x_ny)f(y)dy - \int_{\mathbb{R}} \sin(xy)f(y)dy\right| = \lim_n\left|\int_{\mathbb{R}} (\sin(x_ny)- \sin(xy))f(y)dy\right|.$$ Can I move the limes inside the integral because of the continuity of continuous of integrals.
Or could I use the dominated convergence somehow?
Thanks","['integration', 'measure-theory', 'continuity', 'real-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral']"
