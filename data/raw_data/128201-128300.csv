1966609,How to check if you are counting right?,"Combinatorics is ""hard"" even at the elementary level in that verifying answers becomes extremely tricky. While in algebra while a solution to an equation such as
$$x^2+4x+3=0$$ is desired, the solution can be obtained and can be checked by plugging the solution by plugging the answer back into the equation. Consider for instance, this problem. Find the number of ways to create $5$ groups of exactly two among $10$ people such that no person belongs to two groups. An incorrect solution: First select a group of two people from the $10$ people. There are ${10 \choose 2}$ of doing this. The next group can be selected in ${8 \choose 2}$
   ways and so on. So by the multiplication principle, the total number of ways equal to the value of the following product. $${10 \choose 2} \times {8 \choose 2} \times {6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 
2}$$ The idea in the next (incorrect) solution is to create a bijection between the number of permutations of the people standing in a line and the number of groups that can be formed. Though this is the same idea that one possible correct solution uses the groups are overcounted. Incorrect solution-2 : There are $10!$ ways in which the $10$ people can stand in a line. The first and the second person, the third and the fourth and so on are placed in a single group. Since switching the first and second position will give another permutation but the same groups we need to divide by $2$. Similarly switching the third and the fourth position will give a different permutation but the same groups. Therefore ultimately, the total number of ways to form the $5$ groups will be $$\frac{10!}{2^{5}}$$ The solution which yields the correct answer is the following Correct Solution-2 :  There are $10!$ ways in which the $10$ people can stand in a line. The first and the second person, the third and the fourth and so on are placed in a single group. Since switching the first and second position will give another permutation but the same groups, we need to divide by $2$. Similarly switching the third and the fourth position will give a different permutation but the same groups. Also consider the following fact. If the people (indicated by letters) are arranged in one permutation as follows, 
  ABCDEFGHIJ then the permutation CDABIJGHEF also correspond to the same set of groups which is why there is a need to divide by $5!$ as there are $5!$ ways to Therefore ultimately, the total number of ways to form the $5$ groups will be $$\frac{10!}{2^{5}\times5!}$$ Questions concerning the correctness of a counting procedure adopted are quite common on this forum. ( I will add some links if you think it is necessary.) This is one reason this question,albeit subjective, has been asked.Also i have not come across any text which addresses how not to undercount or overcount. Any discussion of techniques on how to avoid undercounting/overcounting or how to check the enumeration will be highly appreciated. Note: The problems that I mean when i say combinatorics problems are enumerative combinatorics problems. This will perhaps narrow the scope of discussion by a considerable extent. Though counting in two ways is sometimes a nice way to check whether the solution obtained is right, it takes a lot of ingenuity to enumerate the answer to every problem in two ways. Which is why any answer to this question can avoid that technique and also not include listing out all the possibilities .","['algebra-precalculus', 'combinatorics', 'algorithms', 'soft-question']"
1966620,"Show that $(x_1,x_2)=(0,0)$ is an unstable fixed point for $\dot{x_1} = -x_1 + x_2^6$, $\dot{x_2} =x_2^3 + x_1^6$","Show that $(x_1,x_2)=(0,0)$ is an unstable fixed point for the system $$\dot{x_1} = -x_1 + x_2^6\qquad\dot{x_2} =x_2^3 + x_1^6$$
  Hint: Consider the Lyapunov function $V(x_1,x_2) = ax_1^i + bx_2^j$. What I have done: Let $$f(x):={-x_1 + x_2^6 \choose x_2^3 + x_1^6}$$ then
$$\dot V = \nabla V\cdot f(x) = (aix_1^{i-1},bjx_2^{j-1})\cdot{-x_1 + x_2^6 \choose x_2^3 + x_1^6} = aix_1^{i-1}(x_2^6 - x_1) + bjx_2^{j-1}(x_1^6+x_2^3).$$ I have a theorem that basically says that if $\dot V(x) > 0$ for all $x\in E \setminus \{(0,0)\}$, where $E$ is an open subset of $\mathbb R^2$ containing $(0,0)$, then $(0,0)$ is unstable. Here's my main question : We were given the hint to consider the given Lyapunov function, but I'm having some difficulty understanding how to use this Lyapunov function to show that basically any nonzero $x\in\mathbb R^2$ gives us that $\dot V(x) > 0$. Must I remain general with the $i$ and $j$, or should I arbitrarily pick $i$ and $j$ in this case? If we don't, then we'd have to break this up into cases, but from what I understand, we just need to find a function that satisfies the criteria for the Lyapunov function, not show it works for every possibility.","['stability-in-odes', 'proof-writing', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"

1966926,Evaluating the closed contour integral $\int_\gamma\frac{e^{-\sqrt{z}}}{(z-b)^{k+1}}dz$,"I'm hoping to evaluate the contour integral $$\int_\gamma\frac{e^{-\sqrt{z}}}{(z-b)^{k+1}}dz$$ for $b > 0$, $k\in{\bf Z}_+$ and $\gamma$ a closed contour of the reader's choice which contains $b$. My complex analysis is really rusty, but my understanding is that since $b$ is strictly positive, then we can choose the branch of the square root to be the negative real-axis and then make the contour small enough to avoid crossing this branch, and thus we don't have to worry about the branch cut when evaluating the integral, is that correct? Also, does this integral have a closed form?  Essentially my goal is to use it as a method to quickly evaluate the $k^{th}$ derivative of $e^{-\sqrt{z}}$. I was thinking of writing the exponential function as a power series and then breaking the integral up and evaluating each of the resulting integrals individually, $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\int_\gamma\frac{z^\frac{n}{2}}{(z-b)^{k+1}}dz$$ hoping that by the residue theorem most of these integrals will be zero, but like I said my complex analysis is really rusty, so I was hoping someone could help me do this.","['complex-analysis', 'contour-integration', 'complex-integration', 'branch-cuts']"

1966979,Energy-term Derivation in the Level Set Formulation of Mumford-Shah,"In the level set formulation of the piece-wise constant Mumford-Shah energy for two regions (see e.g. • this presentation on slide 41 • or this video • or page 4 of Chan & Vese, 2001 ), the energy function is
$$
E = \underbrace{\int_\Omega \left(\left(I-\mu_1\right)^2 - \left(I-\mu_2\right)^2\right) H\phi + \left(I-\mu_2\right)^2 \operatorname dx}_\text{data term} + \underbrace{\int_\Omega \left\|\nabla H\phi \right\|_1 \operatorname dx}_\text{perimeter penalty}
\text,
\tag{1}
\label{eq:energy}
$$
where $I$ is the image intensity at location $x$, the constants $\mu_1, \mu_2$ are the expected mean intensitites in the two regions that are to be separated, $\phi\left(x\right)$ is the surface and $H\phi$ is the Heaviside function of $\phi$, i.e. it is $H\phi = 1$ if $H\phi>0$ and $0$ else. In all sources that I've looked into (e.g. Eq. (9) of Chan & Vese, 2001 ), the derivative of the data term of $E$ from Eq. \eqref{eq:energy} w.r.t. $\phi$ is given as
\begin{align}
\delta\left(\phi\right)\cdot\left(\left(I - \mu_1\right)^2 - \left(I - \mu_2\right)^2\right)
\text,
\tag{2}
\label{eq:data_term_deriv}
\end{align}
where $\delta$ is the Dirac delta function, i.e. $\frac{\operatorname d}{\operatorname d\phi} H\phi = \delta$. Why is the above the derivative of the data term w.r.t. $\phi$? Shouldn't it rather be
\begin{align}
\frac{\operatorname d}{\operatorname d\phi} \int_\Omega \left(\left(I-\mu_1\right)^2 - \left(I-\mu_2\right)^2\right) \cdot H\phi + \left(I-\mu_2\right)^2 \operatorname dx &\\
= \int_\Omega \left(\left(I-\mu_1\right)^2 - \left(I-\mu_2\right)^2\right) \cdot \frac{\operatorname d}{\operatorname d\phi} H\phi\operatorname dx &\\
= \int_\Omega \left(\left(I-\mu_1\right)^2 - \left(I-\mu_2\right)^2\right) \cdot \delta\left(\phi\right) \operatorname dx
&\text?
\end{align}
So where's the integral gone in Eq. \eqref{eq:data_term_deriv}? I'm aware of the shifting property of the $\delta$ function, which would explain the vanishing of the integral, but then the $\delta$ itself would vanish as well; yet, it's present in Eq. \eqref{eq:data_term_deriv}.","['derivatives', 'integration', 'calculus']"

1967040,Orientation of $S^n$ under antipodal map,"In Riemannian Geometry, doCarmo p.19-20 the author states that the orientation of $S^n$ (using stereographic coordinates) under the antipodal map $A(p)=-p$ is Reversed for $n$-even, Preserved for $n$-odd. This didn't seem obvious to me at first so I checked it and seem to have come to the opposite conclusion. It would be helpful if someone could check my reasoning and tell me where I'm going wrong: An orientation for $M$ is a differentiable structure $\{(U_\alpha,x_{\alpha})\}$ satisfying the property that $d({x_{\beta}}^{-1} \circ x_{\alpha})$ has positive determinant for all $\alpha, \beta$ with $x_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha}) \cap x_{\beta}(U_{\beta}) \neq \emptyset.$ If a differentiable structure satisfies this is it said to be orientable. A map $\phi \colon M_1 \to M_2$ is said to preserve orientation if the union of the old differentiable structure with the new one induced by $\phi$ is orientable. With these definitions in mind, we look at the stereographic structure on $S^n$ given by $\{(\mathbb{R}^n,{\pi_1}^{-1}),(\mathbb{R}^n,{\pi_2}^{-1})\}$, where $\pi_1(x_1, \ldots , x_{n+1}) = (\frac{x_1}{1-x_{n+1}}, \ldots, \frac{x_n}{1-x_{n+1}})$ and $\pi_2(x_1, \ldots , x_{n+1}) = (\frac{x_1}{1+x_{n+1}}, \ldots, \frac{x_n}{1+x_{n+1}})$. Now introduce ${\hat{\pi}}_1 = \pi_{1} \circ A$ and ${\hat{\pi}}_2 = \pi_{2} \circ A$ and compute the Jacobian determinant of $\pi_1 \circ {{\hat{\pi}}_1}^{-1}$ ...

1967401,Easy way to see that the Chern class is the Poincaré dual of the vanishing locus of a section?,"Let $\mathscr{L}$ be a holomorphic line bundle (perhaps smooth suffices, but I'm concerned with the holomorphic case anyway) on a smooth complex manifold $X$. We can define its Chern class via the exponential exact sequence:
$$
0 \rightarrow \mathbb Z \rightarrow \mathscr O_X \rightarrow \mathscr O_X^\times \rightarrow 0
$$
And the associated cohomology sequence which includes:
$$
H^1(X, \mathscr O_X^\times) = \text{Pic}(X) \rightarrow H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})
$$
We can use this map as a definition for the Chern class $c_1(\mathscr L)$. It is true that if $\sigma$ is a holomorphic section of $\mathscr L$, then if we let $[\sigma]$ denote the homology class represented by the vanishing locus of $\sigma$ (the points $p$ where $\sigma(p) \in \mathscr L$ is $0$), then $c_1(\mathscr L)$ is Poincaré dual to $[\sigma]$ (at least in the case that the vanishing locus of $\sigma$ is a irreducible analytic subvariety). Does anyone know (or know a reference for) a straightforward proof of this fact? Griffiths-Harris shows it via the curvature form definition of Chern class, but this is more hard differential geometry than I am comfortable with. I'd love a proof directly from this exact sequence, but I'd also be happy with assuming that $c_1(\mathscr L)$ as defined here agrees with the topologically-defined Chern class (i.e. defined by axioms or the Euler class or by pullback from a Grassmanian).","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'characteristic-classes', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"
1967413,The series of functions in the complex plane.,"This is closely related to another question that I asked here regarding series of functions in the complex plane . The $\sin(z)$ series in the complex plane is represented as $z-\frac{z^3}{3!}+\frac{z^5}{5!}-\cdots$. In the real line with $\sin(x)$ we have Taylor's series and and the remainder and the convergence and such things. The question I have is---- how do we get this extension with the complex plane? In the question I have referred, people suggested that it was just a definiton, and that $\sin(z)=z-\frac{z^3}{3!}+\frac{z^5}{5!}-\cdots$ was defined as such. But somehow that answer seems very unconvincing. It is like being told that the $\sin(x)$ series extension in the real plane is defined as such. It seems like it may have got something to  do with $\sin(z)$ extension in the complex plane having to satisfy the $\sin(x)$ component in the real line too (because real is a subset of complex) and since the coefficients in the real line is known to be $(1,0,\frac{1}{3},0,\frac{1}{5}......)$ the coefficients in the complex series expansion also have to be the same, although I dont know whether that line of approach is correct or whether it can be proven rigorously.",['complex-analysis']

Most books I read interpret this as a long term relative frequency, that is, if you observe many ""independent"" such situations then the limiting frequency will go to 0.3. But this is not the definition of probability, and probability theory only says that this will happen with probability 1, not that it will happen surely.(measure 0 events etc.) I guess what I am wondering is when we use probability in statistics and the real world, what does it mean when we say that an event have probability p. If we just are concerned with mathematics this is easy, then we are just saying that the measure of that event is p. So when we model a real world situation with probability in our abstract world, we give a real world event a measure p, but what are we actually saying about the real world then?","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'mathematical-modeling']"

Does the claim still hold if we modify the definition of $Y$ so that instead of $ Y: = V(b) \cup (X-U)$ ?

f\in A_b = \Gamma(D(b), \mathcal{O}_X) = \bigcap_{z \in D(b)}\mathcal{O}_{X,z}

We will speak about this curve. Example: The circle can be described by $x^2 + y^2 -1 = 0$ We say two polynomials $P,Q$ are touching in point $(a,b)$ if $P(a,b) = Q(a,b) = 0$ and the tangent at $(a,b)$ is the same. Or more geometrically, the curves of $P$ and $Q$ are not crossing. (The Figure was created with IPE - drawing editor.) We also need a further technical condition. For this let $D$ be a ''small enough'' disk around $(a,b)$. Then $Q$ and $P$ define two regions indicated green and yellow. Those regions must be interior disjoint.  Without this condition for $P = y-x^3$ and $Q=y$ the point $(0,0)$ would be a touching point as well. See also the right side of the figure.

Example: given $A,B,C,D$ independent, with the result above I can directly claim that things like $A\cup B, C\cap D^c$ are independent without having to take pains to verify them. There is one proof that requires knowledge of independent r.v.: it is based on the theorem which states that if $X_{1,2,\cdots n}$ are independent r.v., and $\{i_1,i_2,\cdots,i_k\},\{j_1,j_2,\cdots, j_s\}$ are disjoint subsets of $\{1,2,\cdots ,n\}$, then for continuous functions $f,g$ we have $f(X_{i_1},\cdots,X

So we can state the following: $$\int\frac{d\left[\arctan\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)\right]}{dx}\cdot dx = \int\frac{d\arctan(x)}{dx}\cdot dx  $$ Now this is where I'm starting to have hesitations: We want to prove the equality $\forall x \gt 1 $, so what I think I should do is take those integrals from 1 to x. Indeed that works: $$\int_1^x\frac{d\left[\arctan\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)\right]}{dx}\cdot dx = \int_1^x\frac{d\arctan(x)}{dx}\cdot dx   $$ If we simplify, we'll arrive to the desired equation. There are two problems with the above integral: at $x = 1, \arctan\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)$ is not defined. However, $$\lim_{x\to1^+}\arctan\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right) = -\frac{\pi}{2}$$ Since we're not interested in x = 1, am I right in thinking that if the following equation is the correct formulation of the problem? $$\lim_{h\to1^+}\left[\int_h^x\frac{d\left[\arctan\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)\right]}{dx}\cdot dx\right] = \lim_{h\to1^+}\left[\int_h^x\frac{d\arctan(x)}{dx}\cdot dx \right]$$ The other problem is that I don't think that the fact that two functions have equal area under their curve means they're necessarily equal to each other for all x. However if I prove that they are equal at a point $x_0$, and then prove that they are also equal at $x_0+\epsilon$, where $\epsilon\to0^+$, then I prove that they are equal for all x greater than $x_0$ Is my reasoning corret? EDIT : I noticed that I made a rather big copying mistake. Everywhere where I wrote $$\int\arctan\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)\cdot dx $$ I actually meant: $$\int\frac{d\left[\arctan\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)\right]}{dx}\cdot dx $$ Which does indeed change the meaning of my equations by A LOT","['trigonometry', 'calculus']"

EDIT: I was initially satisfied with the responses given, but on further thought I don't think I follow the logic of tired's answer, which invokes the stationary phase approximation. In particular, my understanding of the stationary phase approximation is that one looks for stationary points of the argument of the exponential since these correspond to the points where the oscillation is slowest – away from this point, the oscillations 'cancel out' because of how rapid they are. However, in this case the argument of the exponential has no stationary points. Further, whilst I can appreciate that (in the case where there are no stationary points) a 'boundary maximum point' would dominate the integral in the real case (that is, for which the argument of the exponential is real), I can't see that this would be relevant in the imaginary case. I am looking for an answer that includes the following three points: A proof that the limit of this integral is independent of regulator (for a suitable class of regulator). Some intuition as to why we might expect this particular integral to be independent of regulator. Information on whether there is some general theory about assigning, perhaps uniquely, a value to non-convergent integrals. In particular, I would like to know whether the fact that the integral at the top of this question is 'almost convergent' (in the sense that it is bounded for all $a$) makes it easier to unambiguously regulate.","['real-analysis', 'integration']"

Then the following are equivalent: 1)$F$ is proper 2)$F$ is closed and $F^{-1}(q)$ is compact for any $q\in N$ I'm able to prove the implication 1)$\Rightarrow$2), but not the converse. Let $K$ a compact subset of $N$, then it's closed (beacuse N is Hausdorff), so an idea could be to prove that $F^{-1}(K)$ is contained in some compact subset.
A way can be these (it's not suggested by the exercise, it's only a my perhaps wrong idea): Prove that for each $P\in N$ there is some $V_P$ compact neighborhood s.t its preimage is compact (one i think should use here the local-compactness property and the fact that F^{-1}(P) is compact). $K$ is contained a finite union of neighborhoods of such kind (by compactness of K), then $F^{-1}(K)$ is contained in a closed union of compacts, which are the preimage of the neighbouroods",['general-topology']

I know (for instance) that if $M_p=0$ for all $p\in Ass(M)$, then $M=0$; so in some sense $Ass(M)$ is a finite version of $Supp(M)$ ($Ass(M)$ is a finite set). Also that if $p\in Ass(M)$, then $\kappa(p)\subset M_p$, where $\kappa(p)$ is the residue field of $A_p$. Furthermore $p\in Ass(M)$ if and only if $M_p$ has depth $0$.

The Markov property for a stochastic process is defined as follows: A stochastic process $X$ with index set $\mathbb R_{\geq 0}$ and values in $(S,\mathcal{S})$ is called a Markov process, if one can find a transition group $(P_{s,t})_{s\leq t}$, such that $$E(f(X_t)\in A\mid \mathcal{F}_s)=P_{s,t}f(X_s):=\int f(x)P_{s,t}(X_s,dx)$$
  holds for all Borel functions $f\geq 0$ and all $A\in\mathcal{S}$. If $S$ is a Borel space, then there is a probability kernel $\mu$ such $=P(X_t\in . \mid X_s)=\mu(X_s,.)$ and we can take $P_{s,t}=\mu(X_s,.)$ For the case $f=id$ we have the following:
\begin{align}
E[X_t\mid \mathcal{F}_s]&=E\left[\exp\left(\left(\mu-\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)t+\sigma W_t\right)\mid\mathcal{F}_s\right]\\

For $G$ a group, we call a set $X$ a rigid set for $G$ if there exists a group action $. :G \times X \rightarrow X$ that is both free and transitive. Does any group $G$ admits a rigid set $X$? What can we say about the category of rigid sets for $G$ where morphisms are $G$-equivariant maps?

For example, the natural action of $SO(3)$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ is faithful and transitive, but certainly not free.
