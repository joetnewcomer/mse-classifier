4019837,"This (rather long) implicit equation has a short explicit solution, but how can it be found?","I am curious if a method exists for solving for $k$ or $h$ in this implicit equation: $$\frac{k^2}{h} \mathrm{sech}^2(k) \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{k}{h} \tanh(k)\right)^2} = \ln\left( \frac{k}{h} \tanh(k) + \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{k}{h} \tanh(k)\right)^2}\right)$$ Both $k=0$ and $h=\pm k\, \mathrm{sech}(k)$ are solutions. I can easily check that these work, but I have been unable to find a way to manipulate the implicit equation to get these solutions. I have tried writing the hyperbolic functions in terms of their equivalent exponential functions (like $\tanh(x)=\frac{e^{2x}-1}{e^{2x}+1}$ , etc.), raising $e$ to the power of both sides (to remove the log), and (unsuccessfully) factoring the part under the root. Even Wolfram Alpha says, ""Standard computation time exceeded...""! Again, my question is about what techniques could be used to find these explicit solutions (especially $h=k\, \mathrm{sech}(k)$ ) if I did not already know them. Background I am currently taking Calculus 2. A couple weeks ago, for fun, I decided to try to calculate the shape of a soap film between two parallel rings and the maximum distance between the rings before the bubble would pop. Since the soap tries to minimize surface area, it forms the shape of a catenoid (the surface of revolution of hyperbolic cosine). I let the radius of the rings equal $1$ , $h$ equal half the distance between the rings, and $r$ equal the radius halfway between the rings (the minimum of $cosh$ ). I found that letting $k = \mathrm{sech}^{-1}(r)$ simplified things. Using integration, I found the surface area of $y=\mathrm{sech}(k)\cosh\left(\frac{k}{h}x\right)$ revolved around the X-axis between $-h$ and $h$ . The bubble should then converge to the nearest local minimum of this area. Taking the derivative of this with respect to $k$ and setting it equal to zero gave me the above equation. After trying to solve the equation for a while, I found this site that says the maximum separation between the rings was the maximum height of $\frac{x}{\cosh(x)}$ . I tried this expression in my equation, and, to my amazement, it worked.","['calculus', 'minimal-surfaces', 'problem-solving', 'hyperbolic-functions']"

$ Definition: I define the notion of an ""increasing partition"" $P$ of $[a,b]$ to be a finite partition $\set{z_k}_{k=0}^n \subseteq [a,b]$ where $a = z_0 < z_1 < \cdots < z_n = b$ . It's a minor thing that helps reduce the repetition in the wording herein. Problem Statement: Let $\vp : [a,b] \to \Bbb R$ be a step function with $\set{\a_i}_{i=1}^m$ its discontinuities forming an increasing partition of $[a,b]$ . Thus $\vp$ is constant on each interval $(\alpha_{i-1},\alpha_i)$ . Let $f : [a,b] \to \Bbb R$ be continuous, and let \begin{alignat*}{99}
\vp(\alpha_i^+) &:=\;&& \lim_{x \to  \a_i^+} \vp(x) &&\quad \forall i \in \set{0,1,\cdots,m-1} \\

d_m &:=\;&& \vp(\a_m) - \vp(\a_m^-)
\end{alignat*} Show $$
\int_a^b f \, \dd \vp = \sum_{i=1}^m f(\a_i) d_i
$$ Context: This ultimately comes up as a homework assignment for me, and I just wanted to check my solution, because I have some doubts on it. I'll express those at the end, though, since they tie more intimately into my proof. Attempted Proof: Let the following be: Let $\g_\a := \set{\a_i}_{i=0}^m$ be an increasing partition of $[a,b]$ . (This is the set of discontinuities of $\vp$ , i.e. $\vp$ is constant on $(\a_{i-1},\a_i)$ $\forall i$ .) Let the definitions in the problem statement hold. Let $\ve > 0$ . Let $\ds \delta := \min_{1 \le i \le m} \left| \a_i - \a_{i-1} \right|$ . Let $\g := \set{x_i}_{i=0}^n$ be an increasing partition of $[a,b]$ with $\norm \g < \delta$ . Let $\ol \g := \g \cup \g_\a$ , and let it be written $\ol \g := \set{\ol{x_i}}_{i=0}^p$ . Let $\ol{\xi_i} \in [\ol{x_i}, \ol{x_{i-1}}]$ for each $i$ . (These are our representative valuation points in the definition of the integral.) By the merit of $\ol \g$ being a refinement of $\g$ , and by merit of definition, we have $$
\norm{ \ol \g } \le \norm \g < \delta \le \norm{\g_\a}
$$ By the Cauchy criterion for Riemann-Stieljes integration, then, where $R_\g$ denotes the usual Riemann-Stieltjes sum, $$
\abs{ R_\g - R_{\ol \g} } < \ve
$$ and so $R_{\ol \g}$ equals the desired integral. It remains to see if this equals the desired sum. Write $$
R_{\og} = \sum_{j=1}^p f \para{ \ol{ \xi_j } } \Big( \vp \para{ \ol{x_j} } - \vp \para{ \ol{x_{j-1}} } \Big)
$$ From definition, we may have either $\ol{x_i} = \alpha_j \in \g_\a$ for some $i$ (i.e. is a discontinuity of $\vp$ ), or $\ol{x_i} = x_i \in \g$ for some $i$ . Note that for any consecutive pairing $\ol{x_{i-1}},\ol{x_{i}}$ that not both are in $\g_\a$ . (This is because each are in $\og$ for which $\norm \og < \delta$ , and thus the smallest distance between any two discontinuities of $\vp$ is bigger than the distance between any two members of $\og$ .) Thus, we only have three cases to consider, based on how many of a given pair are, indeed, discontinuities: Case 1 (neither): In the case neither $\ol{x_{i-1}},\ol{x_{i}}$ are discontinuities of $\vp$ , then trivially we will have $$
\vp \para{ \ol{x_j} } - \vp \para{ \ol{x_{j-1}} } = 0
$$ Case 2 (right discontinuity): Suppose $\ol{x_{i}} = \a_j$ for some $j$ (but, again, that means $\ol{x_{i-1}}$ is not a discontinuity). Then in such a case, using the piecewise continuity and constantness of $\vp$ , $$
\vp \para{ \ol{x_j} } - \vp \para{ \ol{x_{j-1}} } = \vp\para{ \a_j } - \vp \para{ \a_{j}^- }
$$ Case 3 (left discontinuity): Similar to the previous, we have $\ol{x_{i-1}} = \a_j$ for some $j$ , and take $$
\vp \para{ \ol{x_j} } - \vp \para{ \ol{x_{j-1}} } = \vp\para{ \a_j^+ } - \vp \para{ \a_{j} }
$$ Let $\ol{\xi_{i,j}}$ be the $\ol{\xi_i}$ whose terms are not eliminated by merit of Case 1 but lie in Case 2; similarly, $\ol{\xi'_{i,j}}$ for those whose terms lie in Case 3. Then we have, once the terms have negated, $$
R_{\og} = \underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \ol{\xi_{i,j}} } \Big( \vp\para{ \a_j } - \vp \para{ \a_{j}^- } \Big) }_{\text{case 2 terms}} + \underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \ol{\xi'_{i,j}} } \Big( \vp\para{ \a_j^+ } - \vp \para{ \a_{j} } \Big)}_{\text{case 3 terms}}
$$ Note that, for the Case 2 terms, each $\ol{\xi_{i,j}}$ is within $\delta$ of $\a_j$ ; specifically, $\ol{\xi_{i,j}} \in (\a_j - \delta,\a_j)$ . Likewise, $\ol{\xi'_{i,j}} \in (\a_j,\a_j+\delta)$ . Since $f$ is continuous, we may take each to be its corresponding $\a_j$ , and write $$
R_{\og} = \sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \a_j } \Big( \vp\para{ \a_j } - \vp \para{ \a_{j}^- } \Big)  +\sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \a_j } \Big( \vp\para{ \a_j^+ } - \vp \para{ \a_{j} } \Big)
$$ Some clear cancellation results, giving $$
R_{\og} = \sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \a_j } \Big( \vp\para{ \a_j^+ } - \vp \para{ \a_{j}^- } \Big) 
$$ Taking the usual convention for what occurs for the $\a_j$ which are $a,b$ , we see the $\vp$ difference here is indeed $d_i$ . So we see $$
\int_a^b f \, \dd \vp  = R_{\og} = \sum_{j=1}^m f \para{ \a_j } d_i
$$ as desired. My Questions / Issues: While I feel like this proof is on the right path, I have some anxieties about some steps. Some in particular I feel aren't quite ""there"" yet. I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me flesh these ideas uot. The use of the Cauchy criterion for Riemann-Stieltjes integrals (stated here) feels far too un-fleshed out, and I doubt it actually lets me conclude that $R_\og$ equals the integral in question. I imagine it only lets me conclude the integral exists at best. I do see that this proof seems to use something similar towards the end of their proof, but their motivation, choice of bound, and the weird $\delta$ 's all escape me. The second chunk of the proof (verifying the alternate form for $R_\og$ ) feels right, but is there any issue there? Something feels sketchy about how I waited until then to define the $\ol{\xi_{i,j}}$ terms to be $\a_j$ in particular, but I don't see how it would be problematic either... I feel like I barely used the continuity of $f$ at all, which means its purpose is lurking elsewhere. Where would that be?

4020035,determine whether a point of a set is in the interior point,"Let $A \subseteq \Bbb R^2$ with $A = \{(x,y): 1<x<4, 1<y<3 \}$ .
Is the point $(2,2)$ be an interior point of $A$ ?
Is the point $(4,2)$ be an interior point of $A$ ?
Justify! Attempt: Edit: I know that the answer is yes and no, respectively.
But, I'm not sure how to show it. To show: $(2,2)$ is an interior point of $A$ .
Let $w \in B(u,r)$ with $u=(2,2)$ . Let $r=\frac{1}{2}>0$ and $k=\frac{1}{2} - ||w-u||$ . Then, $k > 0$ since $||w-u|| < \frac{1}{2}$ . Let $x \in B(w,k)$ . Then, by the triangle inequality, \begin{equation*}
||x-u|| \le ||x-w|| + ||w-u|| \le k + ||w-u|| = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation*} Thus, $x \in B(u,\frac{1}{2})$ so that $B(w,k) \subseteq B(u,\frac{1}{2}) \subseteq A$ .
Hence, $w$ is an interior point of $A$ such that $B(u,\frac{1}{2}) \subseteq int(A)$ and so, $u$ is an interior point of $A$ . How to show it? On the other hand, a point $x \in A$ is an interior point of $A$ if there exists $r>0$ such that $B(x,r) \subseteq A$ i.e.
there exists $r>0$ such that for all $y \in \Bbb R^2, ||y-x||<r \implies y \in A$ .","['multivariable-calculus', 'general-topology']"
4020044,"Counting the number of ways to get a sum of $2012$, given that any number of cards can be chosen","A person has $32$ cards out of which $10$ cards, each of blue, green and red colours, have
denominations as $\{2^1, 2^2,\cdots , 2^{10}\}$ and one black and one white each of whose value is unity. What is the number of ways in which the person can get a sum of $2012$ if he can choose any number of cards? I couldn't think much in it, except that number of ways of choosing $\text{(blue,black,white)}$ is equal to if he chooses $\text{(green,black,white) or (red,black,white)}$ . So if suppose he chooses $\text{(blue,black,white)}$ , the total sum of the cards would be $$1+1+2+2^2+\cdots+2^{10}=2^{11}=2048$$ So, if we remove the cards whose sum equals $36$ , we will get $2012$ . Thus, we need to find the number of ways in which the sum on cards equals $36$ . I tried it, but there were so many cases, that I gave up. I also haven't taken the case if he chooses for instance $\text{(blue,green,white)}$ etc. The answer to this is $1007^2$ , which suggests some easy method must be there.

4020205,Continuous version of Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem.,"Let $T$ be a measure-preserving transformation on the probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{A},\mathbb{P})$ . K ingsman's subadditive ergodic theorem states the following : Let $(g_n)_n$ a sequence of random variables in $L^1(\Omega)$ such that $$g_{n+m}(\omega) \leq g_n(\omega) + g_m(T^n \omega), \quad \forall n,m>0$$ for almost every $w \in \Omega$ . Then there exists $g : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ a $T$ -invariant function such that $$\underset{n \rightarrow + \infty}{\lim} \frac{g_n(\omega) }{n} = g(\omega)$$ for almost every $w \in \Omega$ . Moreover, if $T$ verify the ergodic property (every $T$ -invariant function is constant almost everywhere on $\Omega$ ), then $g$ is a constant function. I am looking for a continuous version of this theorem. I would like a theorem that works on the following framework : Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P})$ a probability space equipped with a group of transformation $(\tau_x)_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d}$ such that $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P},(\tau_x)_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} )$ forms a $d$ -dimension dynamic system. Let $(w \mapsto g(x,\omega))_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d}$ a family of random variables in $L^1(\Omega)$ indexed by $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and assume that $$g(x+z,\omega) \leq g(x,\omega) + g(x,\tau_z \omega), \quad \forall x,z \in \mathbb{R}^d$$ and for a.e $w \in \Omega$ .

Moreover, if I assume the following : the field $g : \mathbb{R}^d \times \Omega$ is stationary (i.e there exists a random variable $\tilde{g} \in L^1(\Omega)$ such that $g(x,\omega)=\tilde{g}(\tau_x \omega)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and almost all $w \in \Omega$ ) the system $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P},(\tau_x)_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} )$ is ergodic can I say that $h$ is a constant function (yes thanks to ergodicity) and do we have $h=\mathbb{E}[\tilde{g}]$ ?","['measure-theory', 'ergodic-theory', 'probability-theory', 'dynamical-systems']"
4020230,Asymptotic solution to the differential equation $y''+(\pi^2+\varepsilon)y+y^2=0$ with $y'(0)=y'(1)=0$,"In studying perturbation methods, I am stuck with the following problem. Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a small parameter. Find the asymptotic approximation to the non-constant solution of the differential equation $$
y''+(\pi^2+\varepsilon)y+y^2=0,\\

$$ I tried to solving it by perturbation method. Assume that we have the expansion $$
y(x)=\varepsilon^\alpha y_1(x)+\varepsilon^\beta y_2(x)+\cdots, \quad (*)$$ where $0<\alpha<\beta$ . Substituting it into the original differential equation, at leading order $O(\varepsilon^\alpha)$ , we obtain $$
y''_1+\pi^2 y_1=0,\\
y'_1(0)=y'_1(1)=0,
$$ which yields $y_1(x)=A\cos(\pi x)$ , where $A$ is a constant. To find the value of $A$ , we need to look at the next order, which is $$
\varepsilon^\beta y''_2+\varepsilon^\beta y_2+\varepsilon^{1+\alpha }y_1+\varepsilon^{2\alpha} y_1^2=0,\\
y'_2(0)=y'_2(0)=0$$ I tried to balance the terms by choosing $\beta=1+\alpha$ or $\beta=2\alpha$ or $1+\alpha=2\alpha$ or $\beta=1+\alpha=2\alpha$ . However, in each of the cases,  I ended up with $A=0$ when substituting the solution of $y_2$ into the boundary conditions. On the other hand, integrating the original differential equation once, we have $$
y'^2+(\pi^2+\varepsilon)y^2+\frac{2}{3}y^3=C,$$ where $C$ is a constant. Using the boundary conditions $y'(0)=y'(1)=0$ , we can find the values of $y(0)$ and $y(1)$ once $C$ is specified. By separating variables, we see that $$
\int_{y(0}^{y(1)}\frac{dy}{\sqrt{C-(\pi+\varepsilon^2)y^2-\frac{2}{3}y^3}}=\int_{0}^1 dx=1,$$ which can be used to find the constant $C$ . Numerical calculations show that for small $\varepsilon>0$ , $C$ exists, so the differential equation has non-constant solutions for small $\varepsilon>0$ . For instance, when $\varepsilon=0.01$ , $C\approx 1.1699$ and the graph of a non-constant solution plotted by Mathematica is I think that problem is that the asymptotic expansion of the non-constant solution may not be of form (*), but I don't know how what the correct form is.","['asymptotics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'perturbation-theory']"

The first question is, what other methods are known and which of them can be generalised to the case of parametric families of vector fields? MY APPROACH I've also conducted an experiment, and came up with the following method. We can introduce a parameter $\varepsilon$ : $$
\dot{x}(t,\varepsilon) = Ax(t,\varepsilon) + \varepsilon\varphi(x(t,\varepsilon)).
$$ When $\varepsilon = 0$ we get the linearised system, and when $\varepsilon = 1$ we have the original system. Now denote $$

\dot{y}(t,\varepsilon) = A y(t,\varepsilon) + \varphi(x(t,\varepsilon)) + \varepsilon\varphi'(x(t,\varepsilon))y(t,\varepsilon).
$$ We know that the solution $x(t,\varepsilon)$ exists, is unique and smooth in some neighbourhood of zero $U$ for all $\varepsilon \in [0,1]$ , so everything is alright and we can define smooth functions $F(t,\varepsilon) = \varphi(x(t,\varepsilon))$ , $f(t,\varepsilon) = \varepsilon\varphi'(x(t,\varepsilon)) + A$ in $U \times [0,1]$ . Then our equation $$
\dot{y}(t,\varepsilon) = f(t,\varepsilon)y(t,\varepsilon) + F(t,\varepsilon)
$$ has a unique smooth solution which satisfies a condition $y(0,\varepsilon) = 0$ maybe in some smaller neighbourhood of zero $W$ for all $\varepsilon \in [0,1]$ . Finally, if we have two systems $$
\dot{x_0}(t) = A x_0(t)

4020469,On the notation of the likelihood function,"Let $X$ be a random variable realized as the event $(X=x)$ .
The corresponding likelihood function is given by $$\mathcal{L}_x:\Theta\rightarrow[0,1]$$ $$\theta\mapsto P(X=x|\theta)$$ for a space $\Theta$ of parameter configurations $\theta$ . In the literature, $\mathcal{L}_x(\theta)$ is sometimes written as $\mathcal{L}(\theta|X=x)$ . I assume this is done to emphasize that the event $(X=x)$ is 'given'.
However, this notation leads to confusion, since
it suggests that $\mathcal{L}_x$ is a probability density ('conditioning' on the event $X=x$ ), which appears to not be true in general (cf. second answer in this thread on math.overflow ). So my questions are: Is $\mathcal{L}(\theta|X=x)$ just 'overloading' the notation $f(\cdot|\cdot)$ , or is there some hidden meaning/analogy to conditional probability $P(\cdot|\cdot)$ which I am missing? Are there other areas in mathematics where $f(\cdot|\cdot)$ is used? Could you provide an example? Currently, I think $\mathcal{L}(\theta|X=x)$ is a bad notational choice because it caused confusion for me when trying to understand the likelihood function.
Especially since at any point $\theta$ , one has $\mathcal{L}(\theta|X=x)=P(X=x|\theta)$","['notation', 'statistics', 'conditional-probability', 'log-likelihood']"

So for $|x|>1$ , $(1)$ certainly does not hold. After a little digging I found that we can differentiate functional series so long as we can justify a few criteria.

4020724,Non-standard five-point formula for second derivative used in Tracker,"Tracker is an open-source program used to analyze object trajectories from video. The typical data sets Tracker produces are time series of object positions at various times, i.e., data pairs (t_i,x_i) for $i=1$ to $N$ . The time samples are assumed to have uniform time step $t_{i}-t_{i-1}=\Delta t$ . Tracker then uses this data to generates estimates for the first and second derivatives, corresponding to the velocity $v=dx/dt$ and acceleration $a=d^2x/dt^2$ respectively. By default, it does this using the following finite difference schemes: $$v_i = \frac{x_{i+1}-x_{i-1}}{\Delta t},\qquad  a_i = \frac{1}{7(\Delta t)^2}(2x_{i+2} - x_{i+1} - 2x_i - x_{i-1} + 2x_{i-2}) $$ The first is a standard two-point formula which requires no comment. However, the standard 5-point formula for the second derivative is $$f''(x)\approx \frac{-f(x+2h)+16 f(x+h)-30 f(x)+16f(x-h)-f(x-2h)}{12h^2} \tag{1}$$ which has error of order $O(h^4)$ . (Note that this formula is exact for quartic polynomials but not quintic.) The formula used by Tracker, by contrast, would correspond to $$f''(x)\approx \frac{2f(x+2h)- f(x+h)-2 f(x)-f(x-h)+2f(x-2h)}{12h^2}. \tag{2}$$ Both sides do match in the limit $h\to 0$ , but the error is instead $O(h^2)$ . So Tracker uses a scheme which, on the face of it, is not as precise. Tracker's documentation doesn't address this point in detail, but does state the following: ""Note: there are many other finite difference algorithms. Tracker's algorithms define the velocity for a step to
be the average velocity over a 2-step interval, and the acceleration to be the second derivative of a parabolic fit over a 4-step interval, with the step at the center. Tracker's acceleration algorithm is less sensitive to position uncertainties than others."" The last sentence is especially notable. So my question as a whole is: What's the precise motivation behind Tracker's use of approximation (2), and in what sense (if any) is it ""less sensitive to position uncertainties?""","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'approximation', 'numerical-methods']"

4020884,One-point gradient estimator and Stokes' theorem.,"In bandit convex optimization, we are only given access to zeroth-order oracle of a function but not first-order (gradient) oracle.

More specifically, let $f:\mathbb{R}^d\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ be a function in $\mathbb{R}^d$ , $\mathbb{S}$ be the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$ , $\mathbb{B}$ be the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$ . For a point $\mathbb{x}\in\mathbb{R}^d$ , if we want to estimate $\nabla f(\mathbf{x})$ , we randomly sample a $\mathbf{u}$ from $\mathbb{S}$ . Let $\delta>0$ be a small positive scalar. We query the zeroth-order oracle and obtain $f(\mathbf{x}+\delta \mathbf{u})$ . We then use $\frac{f(\mathbf{x}+\delta \mathbf{u})d\mathbf{u}}{\delta}$ as an approximation of $\nabla f(\mathbf{x})$ . Lemma 1 in this paper proved that the expectation of the approximation is the gradient of a smoothed version of $f$ , that is let $\hat{f}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{B}}[f(\mathbf{x}+\delta \mathbf{v})]$ , then $\nabla \hat{f}(x)=\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{u}\in \mathbb{S}}\big[\frac{f(\mathbf{x}+\delta \mathbf{u})d\mathbf{u}}{\delta}\big]$ .

z^2 - \cos z=0
$$ The reasoning below is based on using Rouche's theorem. So basically I picked two functions $f(z)$ and $\phi(z)$ such that: $$
f(z) = z^2\\
\phi(z) = \cos z
$$ Now I need to show that $|f(z)| > |\phi(z)|$ for $|z| = 2$ . My main issue here is proving that statement. Consider $|z^2|$ , clearly the absolute value is $4$ . For $|\cos z|$ and $y\in[-2,2]$ : $$
\begin{align}
|\cos z| &= \left|\frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2}\right| \\
&= {1\over 2}\left|e^{ix - y} + e^{-ix+y}\right| \\
&\le {1\over 2}\left(\left|e^{ix}\right|\left|e^{-y}\right| + \left|e^{-ix}\right|\left|e^{y}\right|\right)\\
&={1\over 2}\left(e^{-y}+e^y\right)
\end{align}
$$ Now $|\cos z|$ is symmetric with respect to $x = 0$ so we might consider only one case: $y \in [0;2]$ . Take a look at the following equation: $$
\begin{align}
{1\over 2}\left(e^{-y} + e^y\right) &= 4 \\
e^{-y} + e^y &= 8 \ \ | \times e^y \\
e^{2y} - 8e^y + 1 &= 0

$$ Solve for $e^y$ : $$
e^y = 4\pm \sqrt{15}

\begin{align}
y = \ln(4+\sqrt{15}) &\approx 2,06343... > 2\\
y = \ln(4-\sqrt{15}) &\approx -2,06343... < -2

|\cos z| = {1\over 2}\left(e^{-y}+e^y\right) < 4, \forall y\in[0,2]

4021115,How to find the probability of drawing colored marbles without replacement?,"There are $2$ red marbles, $3$ white marbles and $5$ black marbles in a bag.
What is the probability of drawing $1$ red marble, $2$ white marbles and $3$ black marbles, if $6$ marbles are drawn without replacement? Answer: $$\frac{\binom{2}{1}\binom{3}{2}\binom{5}{3}}{\binom{10}{6}}=\frac{2}{7}$$ My question is why is the numerator of the answer $\binom{2}{1}\binom{3}{2}\binom{5}{3}$ instead of $1$ ? Below is my answer: Total number of ways to choose $6$ marbles from $10$ marbles is $\binom{10}{6}$ , so combinations such as $BBBBBW$ , $RWWBBB$ , $WWWRBB$ , ... So the probabilty I calculated is $\frac{1}{\binom{10}{6}}$ because $RWWBBB$ is one of the possible combinations out of the $\binom{10}{6}$ total combinations. However this is incorrect, and is supposed to be $\frac{\binom{2}{1}\binom{3}{2}\binom{5}{3}}{\binom{10}{6}}$ . I do not understand why the numerator is the product combinations because it does not make sense to multiply combinations of nondistinct objects. For example, there are $5$ black marbles $BBBBB$ and so the number of ways to select $3$ black marbles is $1$ , therefore it does not make sense to me that it is written as $\binom{5}{3}$ as above. To me this would make sense if it were asking to arrange $3$ letters at a time from $ABCDE$ where the order does not matter. Can anyone explain why the numerator is the product of combinations instead of $1*1*1=1$ ? My observation: I noticed that using subscripts are necessary when there are fewer distinct objects than the total number of objects. See below: The combination formula is $\binom{n}{r}$ where $n$ is total number of objects and $r$ is number of selected objects. Let $k$ be the number of distinct objects where if $k<n$ , then subscripts are needed if $k=n$ , then subscripts are not needed Case $1$ . $k<n$ Suppose I want to select $r=2$ marbles from a bag with $1$ white marble and $2$ black marbles, so $k=2$ and $n=3$ , so $k<n$ So $\binom{n}{r}=3$ with combinations: { $W_1,B_1$ }, { $W_1,B_2$ }, { $B_1,B_2$ } Case $2$ . $k=n$ Suppose I want to select $r=2$ marbles from a bag with $1$ white marble, $1$ black marble and $1$ red marble, so $k=3$ and $n=3$ , so $k=n$ So $\binom{n}{r}=3$ with combinations: { $W,B$ }, { $W,R$ }, { $B,R$ }","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
4021177,"Calculate the integral $ \iint_R\sqrt{y/x}\,e^{\sqrt{xy}}\,dA$","The $R$ is the region of integration, described in the following image. To solve this integral we make a change of coordinates with $u=\sqrt{xy}$ and $v=\sqrt{\frac{y}{x}}$ . Furthermore, in the region of integration we have $x>0$ and $y>0$ . Then $u^2=xy$ y $v^2=\frac{y}{x}$ , so we have: \begin{align*}
    v^2 &=\frac{y}{x}\\
    x^2v^2 &= xy\\
    x^2v^2 &= u^2.
\end{align*} \begin{align*}
    x^2 &= \frac{u^2}{v^2}\\
    x &= \frac{u}{v}.
\end{align*} Observation: $x=-\frac{u}{v}$ is not taken, because $x>0$ in the $R$ region. With the above we can solve for $y$ . \begin{align*}
    v^2& = \frac{y}{x}\\
    v^2& = \frac{y}{\frac{u}{v}}\\
    uv & = y.
\end{align*} On the other hand, in the $R$ region we have the following equations $xy = 1$ , $y = x$ and $y = 2$ . Now with all of the above, let's pass these equations to the coordinates $u$ and $v$ . \begin{align*}
    xy = 1 &\Rightarrow u  = \sqrt{1} \Rightarrow u = 1\\
    y = x  &\Rightarrow uv = \frac{u}{v} \Rightarrow v^2 = 1 \Rightarrow v = 1\\
    y = 2  &\Rightarrow 2 = uv.
\end{align*} Observation: By definition of $u$ and $v$ , we have to be positive about the values ​​taken by the $R$ region, therefore $v = -1$ is not taken. Using the above equations, we have that the region $R$ is transformed into the region $S$ , shown below. Now using $x = \frac{u}{v}$ and $y = uv$ we calculate the Jacobian to use the change of variable in the original integral. \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial x}{\partial u}&=\frac{1}{v} &\frac{\partial y}{\partial u} =v\\
    \frac{\partial x}{\partial v}&=-\frac{u}{v^2} &\frac{\partial y}{\partial v} =u
\end{align*} Thus, the Jacobian is: \begin{align*}
    \begin{vmatrix}
    \frac{1}{v}    &v\\
    -\frac{u}{v^2} &u
    \end{vmatrix}
    =\frac{u}{v}+\frac{u}{v}=\frac{2u}{v}.
\end{align*} So using all the information developed we have: \begin{align*}
    \iint\limits_R\sqrt{\frac{y}{x}}e^{\sqrt{xy}}dA &= \iint\limits_Sve^u\left(\frac{2u}{v}\right)dA\\
    &= 2\int_{1}^{2}\int_{1}^{2/u}ue^u\,dv\,du\\
    &= 2\int_{1}^{2}ue^uv\biggr\rvert_{1}^{2/u}\,du\\
    &= 2\int_{1}^{2}ue^u\left(\frac{2}{u}-1\right)du\\
    &= 2\int_{1}^{2}e^u(2-u)du=2(e^u(3-u))\biggr\rvert_{1}^{2}=2e(e-2).
\end{align*} I think this is the correct solution, I await your comments. If anyone has a different solution or correction of my work I will be grateful.","['integration', 'multivariable-calculus', 'multiple-integral']"
4021202,Is there hope for Einstein tensor notation in Quantum Mechanics?,"The Core Question How would one define and justify the tensor notation for vectors and operators on a separable Hilbert space? Motivation Whenever I work with finite-dimensional linear algebra, I find it very illuminating to think about vectors, linear maps, bilinear forms etc. collectively as just various types of tensors. I like how the tensor formalism puts emphasis on representation-free formulations and how even a very complicated multi-linear map can be understood in terms of its individual „indices“. When I started to learn Quantum Mechanics, I immediately tried to use the tensor notation. At a surface level it seemed to work just fine. One can formally rewrite the bra-ket expressions on left with a „tensor-like“ notation on the right: $$
\begin{aligned}
  \left< \psi \mid \varphi \right>
  \qquad &\leftrightsquigarrow \qquad
  \overline{\psi^{\,\mu}} \; g_{\overline{\mu} \nu} \; \varphi^\nu
  \\
  \left| \psi \right> = \hat A \hat B \left| \varphi \right>
  \qquad &\leftrightsquigarrow \qquad
  \psi^{\,\mu} = A^\mu_\nu \; B^\nu_\kappa \; \varphi^\kappa
  \\
  W = \left| \psi \right>\left< \psi\right|, \;
  \operatorname{Tr} W = 1
  \qquad &\leftrightsquigarrow \qquad
  W^\mu_\nu = \psi^{\,\mu} \; g_{\overline{\kappa}\nu} \; \overline{\psi^\kappa}, \;\;
  W^\mu_\mu = 1
\end{aligned}
$$ Furthermore, the tensor notation feels more natural when dealing with composite systems, where the state is a tensor product of states of the underlying systems. However, when I tried to put the notation on a more rigorous ground, I learned that the topic is much more difficult and nuanced than I thought. The Problem In finite-dimensional spaces, the tensor notation is made possible by several circumstances: \begin{gather}
V^* \otimes V \simeq \operatorname{Hom}(V, V)
\label{homomorphism} \tag{1} \\[5pt]
T(\mathbf{v}) = T( \; \sum_k v^k \mathbf{e}_k \;) = \sum_k v^k \; T(\mathbf{e}_k)
\label{continuity} \tag{2} \\
\big| \operatorname{Tr}(T) \, \big| < \infty
\label{trace} \tag{3}
\end{gather} While \eqref{homomorphism} essentially makes sure that all $k$ -covariant $l$ -contravariant tensors are from the same space, \eqref{continuity} lets us describe all tensors using their coefficients wrt. some basis and \eqref{trace} lets us express all operations on tensors using just tensor product and contraction. In a sense, neither of these is true for the separable Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ where QM is done. By a basis on a Hilbert space one usually means the Schauder basis , which describes vectors with an infinite series of coefficients. This, combined with the fact that most interesting operators in QM aren't continuous, gives us: $$
  T(\mathbf{v})
  = T( \; \sum_{k=1}^\infty v^k \mathbf{e}_k \;)
  = T( \; \lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^N v^k \mathbf{e}_k \;)
  \neq \lim_{N\to\infty} T( \; \sum_{k=1}^N v^k \mathbf{e}_k \;)
  = \sum_{k=1}^\infty v^k \; T(\mathbf{e}_k)
$$ The sequence on the RHS might either diverge, or even converge to a different value than LHS (although this is pathological and usually not considered in practise). Condition \eqref{trace} only holds for the so-called trace-class operators (not even the identity is trace-class) and the space $\mathcal H^* \widehat{\otimes} \mathcal H$ ( tensor product of Hilbert spaces ) is isomorphic to finite-rank operators, a proper subset of $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal H, \mathcal H)$ . A Possible Solution? (and more questions) These unfortunate circumstances mean, that if it's even possible to justify the tensor notation in infinite-dimensional spaces, it can't be by a simple generalization of the finite-dimensional case. So, is it possible to make it work? The condition \eqref{continuity} seems relatively easy to fix – one just needs to replace the Schauder basis with a Hamel basis . A serious downside to this would be that a typical operator would have an uncountable number of coefficients. For \eqref{homomorphism} it would be great if one could find a space $\mathcal G$ , such that the Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ is embedded in it $\mathcal H \subset \mathcal G$ , with the property $\mathcal G \otimes \mathcal G \simeq \operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal H^*, \mathcal H)$ . Vectors of the bigger space could then be used to construct operators and bilinear forms. Here, one immediately thinks about the Gelfand triple $\Phi \subset \mathcal H \subset \Phi^*$ – could it be that $\mathcal G = \Phi^*$ for an appropriate choice of rigging? Sadly it appears that no, as the Schwartz kernel theorem says that $\Phi^* \otimes \Phi^* \simeq \operatorname{Hom}(\Phi, \Phi^*)$ . Is such a space $\mathcal G$ even possible? If yes, would this approach generalize to tensors of higher degree? Finally, the problem with \eqref{trace} seems to be there to stay. There is no reasonable way to define the trace of identity, for example. What I'm interested in is whether, given a complicated expression, one can tell a priori which indices are contractible and which will inevitably diverge. Are these proposed “solutions” any good? Is there any literature that would investigate this topic? Or am I on the wrong path and should I stop wasting my time with tensors in the infinite dimension?","['hilbert-spaces', 'tensors', 'functional-analysis']"
4021298,Expressing a indefinite integral using a definite integral with the same function,"I was wondering how we can express a indefinite integral $\int f(x) \, dx$ with the function $F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\,dt$ . I was experimenting with some functions, for example, if $f(x) = 3x^2$ , then \begin{equation}
\int f(x) \, dx = \int 3x^2 \, dx = x^3 + C.
\end{equation} On the other hand, \begin{equation}
F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt = \int_a^x 3t^2 \, dt = [t^3]^x_a = x^3 - a^3.
\end{equation} That means what $F(x)$ and $\int f(x) \,dx$ differs is only by a constant. I was wondering if there is a proof for $F(x) + C = \int f(t)\,dt$ and the proof works for integrals that do not cannot be expressed as an elementary function (e.g. the error function (maybe)) P.S. I was thinking if this has to do with the derivatives of $F$ and integral of $f$ , but if there is no upper and lower limit in the indefinite integral, we cannot use FTC. That's why I do not know how to proceed. Thanks you! Edit: Yes. I have forgotten to mention that $f$ should be a continuous function, in order to make things more neat and to apply FTC.

4021304,"Dimension of the Invariant Subspace $((\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes 2n})^{\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})}$","This was posed as a challenging exercise by my professor. The exercise is to compute the dimension of the invariant subspace of $(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes 2n}$ viewed as an $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ representation. For some background, $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ can be viewed as traceless $2 \times 2$ matrices with complex entries. So one common basis we see is $e = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, f = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, h = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ . The standard representation of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$ is just by matrix multiplication. Let $v_1 = (1,0)$ and $v_0=(0,1)$ . Observe that $ev_1 = fv_0 = 0$ , $ev_0 = v_1,fv_1 = v_0$ , and $hv_1 = v_1,hv_0 = -v_0$ . In general, if we have a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ acting on two representations $V,W$ , then we can define a representation on their tensor product by a Leibniz rule: $a(v \otimes w) = (av) \otimes w + v \otimes (aw)$ . An invariant subspace of a representation $V$ is really all vectors that are annihilated by every element of $\mathfrak{g}$ : $V^\mathfrak{g} := \{v \in V: av = 0, \forall a \in \mathfrak{g}\}$ . Okay, with that set up, some knowledge of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ tells us that the Lie algebra is completely reducible and all the irreducible complex representations are of the form $V(n) = \langle v_n, v_{n-2}, v_{n-4},...,v_{2-n},v_{-n} \rangle$ , a $n+1$ dimensional vector space. The subscripts here represent the weight which really means that they are eigenvectors of $h$ with their eigenvalue being the subscript. So $h v_{n-6} = (n-6) v_{n-6}$ . I didn't write it this way above but it's mostly due to bookkeeping. Moreover, $e$ adds $2$ to the weight of vectors while $f$ subtracts $2$ from their weight. $h$ doesn't shift the weight. Anyways, the relevance of this is that the invariant subspace must lie within the weight $0$ subspace because otherwise, $h$ cannot annihilate. Also, under tensor products, weights add. For example, $\mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2$ has basis: $v_1 \otimes v_1, v_1 \otimes v_0, v_0 \otimes v_1, v_0 \otimes v_0$ . The first one has weight $2$ , the middle two have weight $0$ , the last one has weight $-2$ . We can show that $e(v_1 \otimes v_0 - v_0 \otimes v_1) = 0$ and $f$ and $h$ also annihilate this vector. Well, $h$ acts by multiplication by $0$ on the weight $0$ subspace so we don't really need to check $h$ . Note also that if we take $(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}$ where $n$ is odd, then there are no weight $0$ vectors other than the zero vector. In this case, there cannot be any nontrivial invariant subspace. That's why we take even number of copies. Now the bookkeeping: I chose $v_1,v_0$ to denote the basis vectors of $\mathbb{C}^2$ because then we can denote the basis elements of $W_{2n} := (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes 2n}$ by strings of zeros and ones. So $\dim W_{2n} = 2^{2n}$ . Among these, the weight $0$ strings are precisely those with half being zeros, the other half being ones. So the weight zero subspace has dimension ${2n \choose n}$ . The invariant subspace has to have dimension smaller than this. I could have chosen $+,-$ instead but it might get confusing to read things like $(+-)-(-+)$ . Also, as an example, in $W_6$ , $e(101001) = (111001) + (101101) + (101011)$ . Basically, $e$ flips $0$ to $1$ like in computers and but kills $1$ ; that's why we see only three terms instead of six which we expect from Leibniz's rule. $f$ does the opposite. I suspect that we really only need to study $e$ but I'm not sure. Anyways, with that lengthy prologue (if you read till here, thank you), I admit that I don't see any combinatorial patterns. I thought I had found something when $n=2$ but it fell apart in $n=3$ . For $n=2$ , I think the invariant subspace has dimension $2$ and is spanned by $(1100)-(1010)-(0101)+(0011)$ and $(1001)-(1010)-(0101)+(0110)$ .","['representation-theory', 'combinatorics', 'lie-algebras', 'invariant-theory']"
4021326,Is it wrong to use limits to calculate an integral of a Piecewise Function?,"In my test I used limits when I calculated the integral of a piecewise function. In my head the reasoning was that it was an improper integral in one piece of the function because it never reached that point although the limit is easily solved with simple substitution. $f(x)=\begin{cases}x+3 & x\in\mathbb{[-2;1]}\\ (x-2)^2 & x\in\mathbb{(1;3]} \\ \end{cases}$ This was the function, so what I did is to calculate the integral of the function I divided the function in two different named function lets say $ g(x)=x+3 $ and $ h(x)=(x-2)^2 $ . As we can see both functions have limited domains for g(x) the domain is $[-2;1]$ and for h(x) the domain is $(1;3]$ . So what I did to calculate the integral of f(x) was: $ \int_{-2}^3 f(x) = \int_{-2}^1g(x) + \lim_{a \to 1^+}\int_a^3h(x)$ I did this because $h(x)$ is never really $1$ , so when calculating the integral of a function that does not contain the bound because it never really reaches the bound I use improper integrals, and that is why I decided to use limit. To solve it I just used simple substitution. I cant understand why that would be wrong, my math teacher took points of my test score because of this but he wasn't able to explain why this was wrong, and frankly I can't understand what is wrong either. So my question is: is this really wrong? And if it is, why? Thanks :)","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'improper-integrals', 'limits', 'piecewise-continuity']"

Is there a property of linear dynamical systems which, if satisfied, ensure that under some rotation the trajectory will lie solely in the positive orthant? To give an idea of the kind of thing I'm looking for (if it exists!): in 2D if the dot products between the set of points are all positive you can guarantee that there's some rotation that could rotate the set of points into the positive quadrant, and if a dot product is negative you know there is no such rotation.

Later edit - a few things I've been considering: People study positive linear systems: linear dynamical systems, $\dot{\boldsymbol{x}}(t) = \boldsymbol{Ax}(t)$ , in which the trajectory, $\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ , never leaves the positive orthant. It turns out if the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ is Metzler, meaning all off-diagonal elements are non-negative, then a trajectory starting in the positive orthant will stay there. This is related to the Perron-Frobenius Theorem which I don't know so much about. So it seems another way of framing my question would be: you have your linear dynamical system in an arbitrary basis. Can you tell whether the dynamics matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ is Metzler under some rotation? The Perron-Frobenius theorem talks about rotation invariant things like eigenvalue spectra which gives me hope that this could be a constructive route, but I haven't been able to fit things together yet... Maybe the clever people on this site will be able to!

4021473,How to prove this lower bound on $\log(1+x)$ for $x \geq 0$? How about $x > -1$?,"I want to show that for all real numbers $x \geq 0$ : $$
\log(1+x) \geq \frac{x(5x+6)}{2(x+3)(x+1)}.
$$ I'd like to understand each step necessary to prove this so that I can apply it to future problems. Amazingly, a popular online calculator immediately spits out that this inequality is true for all $x > -1$ . Is there an easy way to prove this for $x \geq 0$ ? How about $x >-1$ ? Attempt (and more info on how I'm stuck) :
My guess is to use the Taylor series expansion of both sides at $x=0$ (but why is that sufficient for all $x \geq 0$ ?). Expanding both sides: $$
\log(1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4} + \ldots \geq x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{5x^4}{18} + \frac{7x^5}{27} - \ldots = \frac{x(5x+6)}{2(x+3)(x+1)}.
$$ I see that the early order terms match and then they don't. Not sure how to proceed from there. The signs are alternating on both sides, which I'm not sure how to deal with. Though, it seems the coefficients are converging to $0$ on both sides. It also seems the magnitude of the coefficients on the right-hand side is larger than the left-hand side (if you go term-wise), but how do I prove that? And do I need that fact to prove the inequality?","['logarithms', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'taylor-expansion', 'inequality']"

Let $i:D_1\hookrightarrow M$ and $j:D_2\hookrightarrow N$ two embedded disks so that $i$ preserves the orientation and $j$ reverses the orientation. Consider their connected sum given by \begin{equation*}M\#N=(M\setminus\overset{\circ}D_1)\sqcup_\phi(N\setminus\overset{\circ}D_2)

At this point I would like to know if there is a canonical approach to understand how the tangent space at a point of the connected sum looks like and if this can help us to have global information on the tangent bundle. Why Am I asking that? I want to understand some characteristic classes associated to the connected sum. For example we can consider the total Stiefel-Whitney class $w(M\#N)\in H^*(M\#N, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ or the Euler class $e(M\#N)\in H^n(M\#N,\mathbb{Z})$ . I was thinking about the case when the tangent bundle splits as a direct sum (product of manifold $M\times N$ ) and so by using Whitney product formula for the Stiefel-Whitney class we can recover $w(M\times N)$ from $w(M)$ and $w(N)$ . In particular this seems to me no longer true for the connected sum even in the simplest case of connected compact and orientable surface. Question Is there a canonical approach to understand how $T(M\#N)$ looks like and to get information on its characteristic classes?

4021595,Question about smooth functions and their signs with given initial conditions,"Problem Statement Suppose $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function (infinitely differentiable) where $f(x)\geq 0$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$ , $f(0)=0$ , and $f(1)=1$ . Show that there is some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and an $x_0\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $f^{(n)}(x_0)<0$ . Proof Attempt We can consider two cases: Case (1): There exists a $z<0$ such that $f(z)>0$ . By the MVT, there exists a point $z_0\in(z,0)$ such that $$f'(z_0)=\frac{f(z)-f(0)}{z-0}=\frac{f(z)}{z}<0 $$ so we are done. Case (2): For all $x<0$ , $f(x)=0$ . In this case, $f'(x)=0$ for all $x<0$ , which implies that, by left sided derivatives and the fact that $f'$ is smooth, $f'(0)=0$ . It then follows that,  since $f'(x)=0$ on $(-\infty,0]$ , we have $f^{(n)}(x)=0$ for all $x\in(-\infty,0]$ . For $n=1$ , define $z_1$ as the real number in $(0,1)$ such that $$f'(z_1)=\frac{f(1)-f(0)}{1-0}=1$$ For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , define $z_{n+1}$ by the real number in $(0,z_n)$ such that $$f^{(n+1)}(z_{n+1})=\frac{f^{(n)}(z_n)-f^{(n)}(0)}{z_n-0}=\frac{f^{(n)}(z_{n})}{z_n}>0$$ whose existence is given by the mean value theorem. This defines the sequence $(z_n)$ , which converges to $0$ and is strictly decreasing. Edit 2: Continuing, we see that by definition, we have $$f^{(n+1)}(z_{n+1})=\frac{f^{(n)}(z_n)}{z_n}>f^{(n)}(z_n)$$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ with $n\geq 2$ , since $0<z_n<1$ , thus the sequence $f^{(n)}(z_n)$ is strictly increasing and always greater than or equal to $1$ . Now, $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ , but since $(z_n)$ can get arbitrarily close to $0$ and $f^{(n)}(z_n)\geq 1$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , we have $f^{(n)}(0)=0<1\leq f^{(n)}(z_n)$ for large enough $n$ . This is has almost shown that $f$ is not differentiable for some value of $n$ , but I am not quite sure that it has exactly shown that. If it has, then we are done, as Case (2) cannot happen. I would like help either formalizing this or fixing this if it is not true. This is where my argument, to me, seems to break down. Intuitively, the slope of the secant lines between $f^{(n)}(z_n)$ and $f^{(n)}(0)$ is increasing without bound as $n$ increases. My idea was to create a sequence of points which converged to $0$ , but broke the differentiability at $0$ . I would greatly appreciate any tips in proceeding, critiques of my proof outline, or alternative proof methods. Thank you in advance. Edit 1: In Case (2) , I am not explicitly making any assumptions that would lead to a contradiction, but why is this proof going in that direction? Either Case (2) cannot happen, which I find intuitively true, but my intuition often fails me, or one of my assumptions in the beginning of Case (2) is false. Edit: Just to close this off, one of my faulty assumptions was that I assumed the sequence I constructed converged to $0$ , which it doesn't have to.","['smooth-functions', 'real-analysis', 'alternative-proof', 'solution-verification', 'derivatives']"

One quick result is that: $$\frac{\delta n(r)}{\delta \Psi_i^*(r)} = \frac{\delta \Psi_i^*(r)}{\delta \Psi_i^*(r)} \Psi_i(r) = \Psi_i(r)$$ One of the students used the chain rules for functional derivatives: $$\frac{\delta F[n(r)]}{\delta \Psi_i^*(r')} = \int \frac{\delta F[n(r)]}{\delta n(r)}\frac{\delta n(r)}{\delta \Psi_i^*(r')}dr = \int \frac{\delta F[n(r)]}{\delta n(r)}\delta(r - r')\Psi_i(r) dr = \frac{\delta F[n(r)]}{\delta n(r')}\Psi_i(r')$$ Which is a really helpful result because it allows to compute derivatives directly with respect to $n(r)$ and still get what we want by just multiplying by $\Psi_i(r')$ . Now the problem I have, is that, in this line he introduced a new variable $r'$ while it shouldn't, the derivative should be with one variable $r$ everywhere, and I believe that this is not valid when the variables are the same (the integral doesn't vanish.).

4022181,Does eigenvalues of matrix change after multiplication by unitary matrix?,"For a matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ , does multiplication by a unitary matrix $U$ change the eigenvalues of $A$ ? So for: $$Ax = \lambda x \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad AUy = \mu y $$ does $\lambda = \mu$ for some $x,y \in \mathbb{C}^n$ ? I know the above is true for doing left and right multiplication by $U$ : $$ UAU^*y = \mu y \\ 
AU^*y = \mu U^* y \\
Az = \mu z \\
\therefore \mu = \lambda$$ (defining $z = U^* y$ ) Under the guise that unitary matrices are simply rotations, it logically makes sense to me that $\mu$ and $\lambda$ should be identical, and only the the eigenvectors should be different. The statement is true for singular values (see here ), but I'm having trouble proving it for eigenvalues (if it even is true). Edit After a quick example in python, I understand that the above is not true. So instead: where is my thought process going wrong with regard to how unitary matrices/rotations effect eigenvalues?

4022272,Studying set theory using polynomials?,"I came up with a way to do set theory using polynomial arthimetic. To explain, consider two polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ , then we can observe the following analogies: 1. In Polynomial addition $$ |P(x)|+|Q(x)|$$ Is analogous to set intersection of sets because the above equation is only true for $x$ values which make both $P$ and $Q$ zero at the same time. 2. In Polynomial multiplication $$|P(x)| \cdot |Q(x)|$$ Can be thought of as set union because the above equation is true for the numbers which satisfy either $P$ or $Q$ 3. In polynomial division $$ \frac{|P|}{|Q|} $$ The above expression can be thought of a set difference, we remove the zeros of Q which exist also in P. Analogies to set complements: Polynomial reciprocal is similar to set inverses, for example $$ |P(x)^{-1}| = \frac{1}{|P(x)|}$$ Is defined for all values of $x$ except where $P(x)=0$ where it is undefined. To get the whole universal set back, we multiply inverse with regular one: $$|P(x)| \cdot \frac{1}{|P(x)| }=1$$ Proving set identities using polynomials $ A \cup (B \cup C)= (A \cup B) \cup C$ This is directly analogous to associativity of polynomial multiplication , considering three polynomials $P,Q,R$ : $$ ( |P| \cdot |Q|) |R|  = |P|( |Q| \cdot |R|)$$ $A \cup B  = B \cup A, A \cap B , B \cap A$ This is directly analogous to communality of polynomial multiplication.

In a comment of this question a set of five numbers $\lbrace 7442, 28658,148583,177458,763442\rbrace$ is provided by the user Bob Kadylo. This shows that four sets are impossible. Edit 2: In a previous version of my post I made a proof showing that the number of sets needed for Natural numbers $1$ to $N$ so that no pair of numbers in the same set sums to a square is no more than $\lfloor\sqrt{2N-1}\rfloor$ . I realized that I can do significantly better than this. In order to explain the method that has a smaller upper bound I have to transform the problem into graph theory. An equivalent formulation is to have $N$ vertices labeled from $1$ to $N$ . A pair of points are connected iff the two points add up to a square. Then our goal is to color the vertices using the least number of colors so that no two vertices with the same color are connected. The first step in the greedy algorithm for coloring vertices is to make a list of colors with numbers. (ex. RED-1, BLUE-2, GREEN-3, YELLOW-4, etc.) If during the process more colors are required than are on the coloring list, add more colors to the list. The next step is to pick an uncolored vertex and use the lowest color number that isn't connected that the chosen vertex. Repeat the last step until all vertices are colored. The worst case scenario is to use one more color than the degree value of the vertex with the greatest degree (or tied with the greatest degree). If each vertex that is connected to the greatest degree vertex is a different color then the greatest degree vertex has to be a different color from all of those. The vertex with the greatest degree (or tied with the greatest) is $3$ . It has degree $\lfloor\sqrt{N+3}\rfloor-1$ . Therefore the Number of sets (or colors) required is no more than $\lfloor\sqrt{N+3}\rfloor$ . We can do slightly better by using brooke's theorem which states that if a graph is simple, connected, not complete, and not an odd cycle, then the upper bound of the number of colors is equal to the degree of the greatest degree vertex. This means that the new upper bound is $\lfloor\sqrt{N+3}\rfloor-1$ sets. This is the significant improvment from $\lfloor\sqrt{2N-1}\rfloor$ I mentioned at the beginning. End edits For each natural number $X$ there are $\lfloor\sqrt{2X-1}\rfloor-\lfloor\sqrt{X}\rfloor$ numbers that are less than $X$ that when summed to $X$ results in a square. The expression: $\lfloor\sqrt{2X-1}\rfloor-\lfloor\sqrt{X}\rfloor$ increases as $X$ gets larger, because of this fact my guess is that separating the natural numbers into a finite number of sets so that no pair of numbers in a set doesn't sum to a square is impossible.","['elementary-set-theory', 'square-numbers']"

4022531,How to prove that a hexagon is the regular polygon with the most sides that can tile a plane [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Why a tesselation of the plane by a convex polygon of 7 or more sides is not possible? (5 answers) Closed 3 years ago . I need to know the answer to this question to find out why bees use hexagonal cells in hives. I know that a circle takes up the most area using the least perimeter, so bees would try to make shapes as close to a circle as possible to use the most space without wasting too much material on walls. However, bees don't use circles because using circles creates a lot of waste space between cells, so bees use a shape that can tile a plane without overlap. The shape that meets the conditions of having a lot of sides and being regular to look like a circle, and being able to tile a plane  is the hexagon, so bees use this in their hives. However, I want to know whether or not this is the polygon with the most sides that fits this requirement. I try to prove there is no bigger polygon like this. First, I note that an integer number of interior angles must meet at a site and add up to $360$ degrees to tile a plane. For example, squares can tiles a plane because they all have $90$ degree angles, and $4$ of these make $360$ . All polygons have exterior angles adding up to $360$ , so a polygon with $n$ sides has $\frac{360}n$ degrees per side. However, interior and exterior angles are supplementary, thus the interior angle of an $n$ side polygon measures $180- \frac{360}n$ degrees. Now, let's test whether this quantity divides $360$ degrees. We get $360 \over 180- \frac{360}n$ , which simplifies down to $\frac {2n}{n-2}$ . Now, I need to prove that $n=6$ is the biggest number such that this quanitity is an integer, but I am not sure how I would go about  doing that.","['divisibility', 'elementary-number-theory', 'angle', 'geometry', 'tiling']"

I was thinking about how the area of a Pythagorean triple can be found using the Pythagorean triple right before it and I came across something that worked for a large number of Pythagorean triples, $12r^2 + a_{k- 1}b_{k - 1} = a_kb_k$ , a recursive formula where $k$ represents the $k$ th term in a sequence. This seemingly generates a sequence of Pythagorean triples that I could not find used in any other formula. Its important to note that $12r^2$ is  twice the area of Pythagorean triples that stem from side lengths $(3,4,5)$ . Using this formula we can find the $1st$ term of sets where the inradius of each Pythagorean triple is $r + r^2k$ and the relationship between the side lengths are still defined by our recursive formula. These $1st$ terms are triplets with an even value of $a$ where $r$ increases by $2$ : $(8,15,17),(12,35,37),(16,63,65)...$ Note: We find this using $(8,15,17)$ as we have a recursive formula as well as the knowledge that $r = \frac{a + b - \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}2$ ,  which lets us find the side lengths of each Pythagorean triple.

4022657,Expectation of a betting game involving generalized Catalan numbers,"I've recently become interested in a type of biased random walk. In the original context, the simplest problem I cannot answer is as follows: Suppose you enter a simple but lousy betting game. The price to enter
is \$3, and a fair coin is flipped. If it lands heads you win \$4,
otherwise you win nothing. So, each game either increases your wealth by
\$1 or decreases it by \$3. If you begin with just \$3 and repeatedly
enter the game until you can no longer pay the fee, what is the
expected number of games you will play? Actually, I'd like to be able to answer this question for any game where the cost is $m$ , the prize is $m+1$ , and we have any given amount of starting wealth $w$ . This similar question+answer shows that the expectation diverges when $m=1$ for any starting wealth. Another way to phrase the question would be as a random walk. If you consider our position on the number line to be our total wealth after paying the fee, the case $m=w=1$ is a random walk from the origin that ends whenever the position becomes negative. The general case $m$ is a sort of random walk, but really it's more of a ""stumble"", since we either advance one step or reverse $m$ steps. I am interested in the expected length of these $m$ -stumbles. Here is what I know so far: The expected number of games, $g_{m,w}$ , satisfies an easy recurrence relating your starting wealth: $$ g_{m,w}  = 1 + \frac{1}{2}g_{m,w+1} + \frac{1}{2}g_{m,w-m}$$ Which I find has generating function: $$\sum_{w \ge 0} g_{m,w}z^n = \left(\alpha_m - \frac{2z}{1-z}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1 - 2z + z^{m+1}}\right)z^{m}$$ where $\alpha_m = g_{m,m}$ represents the average length of an $m$ -stumble from the origin. The $g$ terms are related to the Fibonacci n-step numbers by $A_{w}\alpha_m - 2B_{w}$ where A is a partial sum of the first $w$ n-step numbers $\sum_{k \le w}F_{k}^{(n)}$ , and B is a double convolution, i.e. the sum of the first $w-1$ partial sums $\sum\sum_{k < w}F^{(n)}_{k}$ . The easiest way to find $g_{m,w}$ given some $g_{m,s}$ that I know of is to use the recurrence directly. I have found the following double sum formula for general $\alpha_m$ : $$\alpha_m = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=1}^{m} k\binom{mn + n + k}{n} / 2^{mn + n + k}$$ which more-or-less follows from the definition of the Fuss-Catalan numbers. Each term represents the contribution to the expectation of games ending at flip number $(m+1)n+k$ . The inner sum does not include the term $k=0$ because it is not possible to lose after flip numbers divisible by $m+1$ . (After flip $n$ your total wealth must be congruent to $n+m \mod{(m+1)}$ , since it increases by exactly $1$ or $-m \equiv +1 \mod{(m+1)}$ each flip, and it begins at $w = m \equiv -1 \mod{(m+1)}$ , so if you haven't already lost your wealth must be at least $m$ meaning you are guaranteed to have enough to pay the fee for these games.) I don't know how to evaluate this sum, but I do know at least one value and have good guesses for others. We know from the linked question $\alpha_1 = \infty$ , but for $m > 1$ , $\alpha_m$ converges. The one value I know is: $$\alpha_2 = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \binom{3n+1}{n}/2^{3n+1} + 2\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{3n+2}{n}/2^{3n+2} = 1 + \sqrt{5}$$ Which is the value Mathematica gives me. I don't how how it arrives at this value, but it appears correct and matches my simulations. Unfortunately, Mathematica chokes on $\alpha_3$ and higher. I guessed that $\alpha_m$ is the root of an $m$ 'th order polynomial, so $\alpha_2 = 1 + \sqrt{5} = (x^2 - 2x - 4)_{+}$ , meaning $\alpha_2$ is the unique positive real root of $x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0$ . A value for $\alpha_3$ would answer the initial problem statement in this question. I find the following guesses match the value of my sum with very high accuracy, to at least 100 digits: $$
\begin{align}
\alpha_3 &= (x^3 - 4x - 4)_{+} \\
\alpha_4 &= (3x^4 + 4x^3 - 8x^2 - 24x - 16)_{+} \\
\alpha_5 &= (2x^5 + 5x^4 - 20x^2 - 32x - 16)_{+}
\end{align}
$$ but even knowing these values I have no idea how to prove them, even for the apparently simple cases of $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ . Does anyone know how to find $\alpha_3$ or general $\alpha_m$ ?","['summation', 'catalan-numbers', 'binomial-coefficients', 'discrete-mathematics', 'probability']"
4022666,Is the image of this function open?,"Suppose $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is continuous and for some $\lambda>0$ , we have $\|f(x)-f(y)\|\geq \lambda \|x-y\|$ for all $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ . Is $f$ surjective? I can show the image is closed by showing it contains its limit points. So, if I can show it is also open, then I am done (I want to avoid using the Invariance of Domain theorem). Obviously, $f$ is one-to-one. By considering the the inverse map defined from $E=f(\mathbb{R}^n)$ back to $\mathbb{R}^n$ we get the following equivalent formulation of the problem: Suppose $E \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is closed and $f\colon E \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is Lipschitz, one-to-one, and onto. Is $E$ necessarily equal to all of $\mathbb{R}^n$ ?","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'lipschitz-functions', 'real-analysis']"

4022824,Find the general solution to the ODE:,"I was asked to find the general solution to these ODEs. $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{(-8x+3y-31)}{(-3x+y-11)}$$ I tried by rearranging to the form $M(x,y)+N(x,y)\frac{dy}{dx}=0$ and let $y=vx$ , but what I got was $$(v^2x-6vx-11v+8x+31)dx+x(-3x+vx-11)dv=0$$ and I could not separate $x$ and $v$ for integration. $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y}{x}+\frac{9}{2}xexp(-\frac{2y}{x})+\frac{9}{2}xexp(\frac{2y}{x})$$ I have totally no idea which method to be used in Question 2.

4023081,Show that a matrix has full column rank,"Consider a matrix $A$ of size $T\times 2K$ . Consider the collection of numbers $k_1,k_2,...,k_T$ , where each $k_t\in \{1,...,K\}$ . Each $t$ -th row of the matrix $A$ is structured as follows: its $k_t$ -th element is equal to $1$ its $(k_t+K)$ -th element is equal to some scalar $\delta_t>0$ all other elements are zero. Further, $A$ does not contain zero columns . I believe that the following holds: $A$ has full column rank $2K$ if and only if there exists $t\in \{1,...,T\}$ and $\tau\in \{1,...,T\}$ with $t\neq \tau$ such that $$
k_t=k_{\tau} \quad \delta_t\neq \delta_{\tau}
$$ Question: I wrote a proof for this claim (below), which looks to me a bit ""naive"". Is there anything more formal and, perhaps, simpler that you can suggest? My proof: $A$ has full column rank $2K$ if and only if the following system admits as unique solution $x=0_{2K\times 1}$ : $$
(*)\hspace{1cm} x_{k_t} + \delta_{t} x_{k_t+K}=0 \quad \text{ for each $t\in \{1,...,T\}$}.
$$ First, I prove sufficiency.
If there exist $t,\tau$ such that $k_t=k_{\tau}\equiv k$ with $\delta_{t}\neq\delta_{\tau}$ , then system $(*)$ contains the equations $$
\begin{aligned}
& x_{k}+\delta_t x_{k+K}=0,\\
& x_{k}+\delta_{\tau} x_{k+K}=0,\\
\end{aligned}
$$ from which it follows that $x_{k}=x_{k+K}=0$ . If the above is true for every $k\in \{1,...,K\}$ , then $x_{k}=x_{k+K}=0$ for each $k\in \{1,...,K\}$ . Hence, the unique solution of system $(*)$ is $x=0_{2K\times 1}$ . Now, I prove necessity.
Suppose there exist only a $t$ such that $k_t\equiv k$ . Then, system $(*)$ contains only one equation involving  any of $x_k,x_{k+K}$ , which is $$
x_{k}+\delta_t x_{k+K}=0,
$$ which is satisfied for any values of $x_k, x_{k+K}$ such that $x_k=-\delta_t x_{k+K}$ . Therefore, system $(*)$ has not a unique solution.","['matrices', 'matrix-rank', 'linear-algebra']"
4023082,On positive dimensional Polish spaces in which every compact set has empty interior,"A standard characterization of the Baire space is that is the only nonempty, zero dimensional, Polish space in which every compact set has empty interior (up to homeomorphism of course). I'm interested in what happens when the zero-dimensional hypothesis is dropped: does there exist, for every $n\in\{1,2,3,\ldots,\infty\}$ , an $n$ -dimensional Polish space in which all compact sets have empty interior? How many such spaces up to homeomorphism are there if I insist that I only want spaces where the local dimension at every point is $n$ (this is to avoid producing many boring examples by taking disjoint unions with smaller dimensional spaces)? I know that every infinite dimensional, separable Banach space is an example for $n=\infty$ , and that we have the complete Erdős space for $n=1$ , but I'm already having troubles finding more examples for finite $n\geq 2$ . Edit: Following discussion in the comments, for every $n$ the space $X_n=\Bbb R^n\setminus \Bbb Q^n$ satisfies $\dim X_n=n-1$ and all of its compact subspaces have empty interior (and it is clearly $G_\delta$ in $\Bbb R^n$ hence Polish). Note that for $n=1$ we recover the Baire space, while for $n=2$ we get an example distinct from the complete Erdős space ( $X_2$ is connected, unlike the complete Erdős space). I now suspect that there is an easy construction of infinite families in all dimensions starting from $X_n$ .","['general-topology', 'descriptive-set-theory', 'dimension-theory-analysis', 'polish-spaces']"
