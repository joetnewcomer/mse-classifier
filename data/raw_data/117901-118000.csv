1746743,Prove that trees have at least two vertices of degree one,"Prove that every tree with $n\geq 2$ vertices has at least two vertices of degree one. What I tried: Suppose that there are fewer than two vertices of degree one. So we can split into two cases. Case one: there is no vertex of degree one. Since we know that every tree has $n-1$ edges then the total degree of any tree have to be $2(n-1)$ . But for this case since no vertex have degree $1$ then every vertex have at least a degree of $2$ and since there are $n$ vertices, the total degree is $\geq 2n$ which is a contradiction. Case two: there is only one vertex of degree one. Similarly  the total degree of any tree have to be $2(n-1)$ . Then there are $(n-1)$ vertices with which have degree of $\geq 2$ while only one vertex with degree of one. Thus summing up to find the total of the vertices, we have that the total degree of vertices is $\geq 2(n-1)+1=2n-1$ which is also a contradiction. This thus proves the statement for both cases. Is my proof correct? Could anyone explain better?","['graph-theory', 'proof-verification', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1746748,Which is easier to integrate?,"My calculus teacher gave us this problem in class: Which is easier to integrate? $$\int \sin^{100}x\cos x dx$$ or $$\int \sin^{50}xdx$$ By easier, I assume the teacher means which integral would take less work.

1746763,Is the notion of a proper map useful between non-locally-compact spaces?,"Recall that a map $f: X \to Y$ between topological spaces is called proper if, for every compact $K \subseteq Y$, $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact. It strikes me that this definition is unlikely to be useful if $Y$ doesn't have ""enough"" compact subsets. And it's likely to be ""too restrictive"" if $X$ doesn't have ""enough"" compact subsets. This is born out in the intuitive picture (cf. wikipedia ) which says that if $f: X \to Y$ is proper, and $\{x_i\}$ is a sequence which ""escapes to infinity"" in the sense that any compact $K \subseteq X$ contains at most finitely many of the $x_i$'s, then the sequence $\{f(x_i)\}$ escapes to infinity in the same sense. This notion could be modified to use nets instead of sequences, but it would still be the wrong notion of ""escape to infinity"" in a non-locally-compact space -- for example, in this sense an orthonormal basis of $\ell_2(\mathbb{N})$ ""escapes to infinity"". So this intuitive picture really only works for locally compact spaces, where it essentially says that $f$ extends to a map between 1-point compactifications sending $\infty$ to $\infty$. Hence the question: is the notion of a proper map useful when one is working with non-locally-compact spaces? For example, are there any interesting theorems whose hypotheses ask that a map be proper without asking that the spaces involved be locally compact? If not, is there some sort of ""substitute"" notion which does work well for spaces that are not locally compact? (It would be nice, but not necessary, for such a substitute notion to agree with properness on locally compact spaces.)",['general-topology']

1747010,"Computing (the ring structure of) $\mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_R(k,k)$ for $R=k[x]/(x^2)$","Let $k$ be some field (say of characteristic zero, if it matters) and define $$R=k[x]/(x^2).$$
I want to compute $$\mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_R(k,k)$$ and, in particular, the ring structure on it (though I think I can do this part if I can compute the Ext modules) . I know that we can think of elements of $\mathrm{Ext}^m_R(k,k)$ as length $m+2$ exact sequences of the form $$0\to k\to X_m\to\ldots\to X_1\to k\to0$$
modulo some sensible equivalence relation, and that we can also think of it as $$\mathrm{Ext}^m_R(k,k) = H^m(\mathrm{Hom}_{R\hbox{-}\mathsf{mod}}(P_\bullet,k)) = H^m(\mathrm{Hom}_{R\hbox{-}\mathsf{mod}}(k,I^\bullet))$$
for some projective (or injective) resolution $P_\bullet$ (or $I^\bullet$, respectively) of $k$. However, when it comes to the hands-on part of actually computing this, I hit a mental block. Since $R$ is a local ring (with maximal ideal $(x)$) we know that projective modules are exactly the free modules, and so computing a projective resolution will probably be easiest...? I would appreciate hints and partial answers over explicit answers (though it's likely I might have to ask for more hints if I still struggle...). At this stage I'll take whatever I can get. Edit: Here is a partial answer, all that remains is the question of the ring structure. Note that $k\cong R/(x)$ and so we have an epimorphism $\pi\colon R\twoheadrightarrow k$ given by $x\mapsto0$ (the quotient map).
If we write $R=k[\varepsilon]$ where $\varepsilon$ is such that $\varepsilon^2=0$ then we obtain the following free resolution of $k$:
$$\ldots\xrightarrow{\cdot\varepsilon}k[\varepsilon]\xrightarrow{\cdot\varepsilon}k[\varepsilon]\twoheadrightarrow k\to0.$$ Now any morphism $k[\varepsilon]\to k$ must send $\varepsilon$ to some element $\eta\in k$ such that $\eta^2=0$.
But $k$ is a field, and so we are forced to choose $\eta=0$.
This means that any such morphism is determined entirely by where it send $1\in k$, and it can send it to any $x\in k$.
Thus $$\mathrm{Hom}_{R\hbox{-}\mathsf{mod}}(k[\varepsilon],k)\cong k.$$
So taking $\mathrm{Hom}_{R\hbox{-}\mathsf{mod}}(-,k)$ of the free resolution gives us the sequence
$$0\to k\xrightarrow{\cdot0}k\xrightarrow{\cdot0}\ldots$$
which has homology $H_n=\ker d_n/\mathrm{im}\,d_{n+1}=k/0\cong k$ for all $n\geqslant0$.
Thus $$\mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_R(k,k)\cong\bigoplus_{n\geqslant0}k$$ So my question now is about the ring structure of $\mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_R(k,k)$, and also about thinking of $\mathrm{Ext}$ as being extensions of $k$ by $k$.
Unless I'm wrong, this means that we should be able to construct, taking $n=1$, short exact sequences $$0\to k\hookrightarrow X\twoheadrightarrow k\to0$$
and the collection of all such sequences should be isomorphic to $k$.
The first thing that sprang to mind was to take $X=R$ and the epimorphism multiplication by $x\varepsilon$ for $x\in k$, but then I struggle to find a monomorphism into $R$ with the right kernel, and also taking $x=0$ means that the map fails to be an epimorphism. What is the correct choice of $\,\,\to X\to\,\,$? How can we compute explicitly the ring structure on $\mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_R(k,k)$ ? Edit 2: Following the ideas in the comments, I'm trying to explicitly spell out the following isomorphism, but I'm struggling to understand how the quotients are realised on both sides (i.e. the equivalence relations): I feel like the right-hand side should just be chain maps modulo homotopy equivalence, even though the $\mathrm{Hom}$ complex is just of maps of chains. I'm pretty certain that the lifts $\hat{f}_\bullet$ that we construct are in fact chain maps.","['derived-functors', 'modules', 'abstract-algebra', 'projective-module', 'homological-algebra']"

Part (a) Solution: There are 30 ball bearings and only 10 need to be chosen, so the sample space is $\dbinom{30}{10}$. Since only the non-defective ball bearings are chosen, 10 of the 25 non-defective ball bearings are chosen to make up the set, $\dbinom{25}{10}$. Part (a) Answer: $P = \frac{\dbinom{25}{10}}{\dbinom{30}{10}}$ Part (b) Solution: There are 30 ball bearings and only 10 need to be chosen, so the sample space is $\dbinom{30}{10}$. There are exactly two defective ball bearings in the set of 10 chosen ones; thus, two of the defective ball bearings must be chosen from the set of five, $\dbinom{5}{2}$. Afterwards, additional eight ball bearings must be chosen and they must be non-defective, so they must be chosen from the 25 available non-defective ball bearings, $\dbinom{25}{8}$.

8 Explanation: Using your GDC to graph the two functions $y=(\tan x)\sin^2(2x)$ and $y=\cos x$ and counting the intersection points over the interval $[-2\pi , 2\pi]$ This is however contrary to what my original answer was, which is $4$ . After some research, asking a teacher, and briefly consulting a tutor from the textbook's company, I am still in doubt concerning where my approach is flawed. It is thence that I approach this community in hopes that someone can lead me to a realization or comment on my procedure. My best guess is that maybe I have conceptualized something wrong, maybe to do with limits, or the nature of equality(?). At any rate, I am humbly lost and it would be very gracious from any of you to help, I would really appreciate it.
So here we go: Relevant ideas and concepts considered under my approach Equality of functions To my knowledge, in order for two functions to be defined as equal (and thus be mathematically the same, even if represented differently) their domains must be formally equal to each other. Equality of sets To my knowledge, the following is accurate and varitable: Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. [...] for any sets A and B, $A=B\iff[x\in A\iff x\in B]\forall x$ My argument Let $f(x)=\tan[x]\sin^2[2x]$ and $g(x)=\cos[x]$ both restricted by definition to $-2\pi \leq x \leq 2\pi$ To find: solutions to the equation $f(x)=g(x)$ The solutions to the equation can be found graphically, by discerning the amount of intersections between their graphs, naturally noting the boundaries of the restricted general domain of the equation.
Alternatively, but in a similar fashion, one can build the set $f \cap g$ and determine its cardinality. Relevant, however, is that $f(x)$ has its domain restricted further by the nature of the function $\tan(x)$ , which is undefined for any value where $x=\frac{(2n-1)\pi}{2}$ for any integer $n$ . Graphically, $\tan(x)$ presents asymptotic behaviour at $x=\frac{(2n-1)\pi}{2}$ .
Let $\mathbb S=\lbrace\frac{-3\pi}{2},\frac{-\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{3\pi}{2}\rbrace$ , the set of x-coordinates where $tan(x)$ presents asymptotes under the restricted domain $[-2\pi,2\pi]$ . Since $\tan(x)$ is a component of the function $f$ , then the domain of $f$ $\mathbb D_f= [-2\pi,2\pi]\setminus \mathbb S$ , for if $tan(x)$ is undefined for a specific $x$ so is $\tan[x]\sin^2[2x]$ (for that same $x$ ). The function $f$ is thusly discontinuous. It then follows that the set of ordered pairs in the form $(x,y)$ representing the relation function of $f$ does not contain any element for which the x value is contained in the set $\mathbb S$ . Plotting $f$ and $g$ on a graph results in the following image: //apparently I can't post images 'yet' jpg image https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CeBRIMMUEAEWBc5.jpg online graph https://www.desmos.com/calculator/8ypryliymf Both functions appear to intersect at 8 distinct points. However, if we also plot $x \in \mathbb S$ we can cognise that 4 of these intersections are ' invalid ', for $f$ is undefined for those $x$ values. $f \cap g \neq 8$ , rather $f \cap g = 4$ So, being explicit on my conclusion, I would state that I believe that:
The domain of $\tan(x)$ does not include any element of $\mathbb S=\lbrace\frac{-3\pi}{2},\frac{-\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{3\pi}{2}\rbrace$ Then (for the set of ordered pairs $f$ ) $f \not \ni (x,0) \forall x \in \mathbb S$ i.e. $f \not \supset \lbrace(\frac{-3\pi}{2},0), (\frac{-\pi}{2},0), (\frac{\pi}{2},0), (\frac{3\pi}{2},0)\rbrace$ Then $\mathbb D_f = [-2\pi,2\pi] \setminus \mathbb S \neq [-2\pi,2\pi] = \mathbb D_g = \mathbb D_{\cos x}$ To which ultimately follows that $f(x) \neq g(x) \forall x \in \mathbb S$ Then $ \lvert f \cap g \rvert = 4 \neq 8$ . -end of my argument- I presented this idea to a [presumed] mathematician, to which they replied as follows: I understand why you have said what you have done. Allow me to suggest another way of thinking. If we replace $\tan$ with $\frac{\sin}{\cos}$ , then multiply both sides by $cos$ , we end up with $\sin(x)\sin^2(2x)=\cos^2(x)$ , which is fully defined at all values of $x$ , and has $8$ possible solutions. The $tan$ function is undefined at certain values of $x$ , in that the value of $\tan$ tends to infinity. However, when we multiply anything (including infinity) by zero, we do always obtain zero. While I am not entirely comfortable with algebra including 'infinities' ( cfr. ""multiply infinity by zero""), I think I understand where they wanted to go.
I however would insist that even though mathematically and by definition (if I recall correctly) I agree that $\tan(x)\sin^2(2x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\sin^2(2x)$ I cannot find myself able to agree to the underlying implied proposition that $f(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\sin^2(2x) \forall x \in [-2\pi,2\pi]$ . Which is, to my mind, strictly important to the nature of the problem at hand. In my mind, that manipulation of the function is a form of removing the discontinuity of $f$ , but it (in my mind) is a process whereby the nature of the function is altered and does not remain strictly 'equal' under the proper definition of 'equality' in terms of functions. It is then that my question about the nature of discontinuities and equalities is: If $$\tan(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$$ does it logically follow that $$f(\frac{(2n-1)\pi}{2})=0$$ (which, I want to emphasize, is not the same statement as $\sin^2(2[\frac{(2n-1)\pi}{2}])=0$ ) ??? // I am a high-school student, so I proffer my sincere apologies if any of the \above notation is inappropriate or if the terminology is not on point.","['limits', 'trigonometry', 'functions', 'continuity', 'elementary-set-theory']"

We have a forgetful functor $\mathbf{NCoalg} \to \mathbf{Vect}$. Its seems that the right adjoint has to be the functor of non-unital tensor coalgebra: 
$$T(V)=V\oplus V^{\otimes 2}\oplus V^{\otimes3}\oplus \cdots ,$$
$$ \Delta(v_1\otimes v_2\otimes \cdots \otimes v_n) = (v_1)\otimes(v_2\otimes\cdots\otimes v_n)+\cdots+(v_1 \otimes\cdots\otimes v_{n-1})\otimes(v_n).$$ Indeed, let $C$ be a coalgebra and $V$ a vector space.

Another counter-example is $H=Q_8$, the quaternion group of order $8$ (I leave their verification to interested reader). Note that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ occurs as automorphism group of $\mathbb{Z}_5$. This raises following two questions to me: Among finite abelian groups, which groups can occur as automorphism groups? Is there any other non-abelian finite group which can not occur as automorphism group?

What can I say about the distribution of the polynomial $H(X)=\alpha(X)\cdot \beta (X)$?

1747858,On a proof that the metric volume form is parallel wrt to the Levi-Civita connection,"In the context of (semi-)Riemannian geometry, the following fact is well-known: if a (semi-)Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is oriented, then the unique volume form $\epsilon = \mathrm{vol}_g$, induced by the metric together with the orientation, is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$. That is,
$$ \nabla \epsilon = 0$$
or, using indices, $\nabla_b \epsilon _{a_1 \cdots a_n}=0$ where $n = \mathrm{dim}(M)$. I am aware of a few different ways of proving this result and most make good sense to me. My problem is that I can't seem to completely follow the logic in one particular proof which I found in Robert M. Wald's ""General Relativity"" (Appendix B, page 432). The argument there goes as follows: $\epsilon$ is uniquely specified by the choice of orientation together with the condition
$$ \epsilon^{a_1 \cdots a_n}  \epsilon_{a_1 \cdots a_n} = (-1)^s n! $$
where $s$ is the number of negative eigenvalues of $g$ (so $s=0$ for a Riemannian metric) and indices are raised and lowered using $g$. Taking covariant derivatives, since the RHS is constant, one has
$$ 0 = \nabla_b (\epsilon^{a_1 \cdots a_n}  \epsilon_{a_1 \cdots a_n}) = (\nabla_b \epsilon^{a_1 \cdots a_n})  \epsilon_{a_1 \cdots a_n} + \epsilon^{a_1 \cdots a_n} \nabla_b \epsilon_{a_1 \cdots a_n} = 2\epsilon^{a_1 \cdots a_n} \nabla_b \epsilon_{a_1 \cdots a_n}$$
using the fact that the metric is parallel with respect to $g$ in the last step. So far so good, we have obtained that $\epsilon^{a_1 \cdots a_n} \nabla_b \epsilon_{a_1 \cdots a_n} = 0$. Question. But then it is argued that this, ""in turn, implies that $\nabla_b \epsilon_{a_1 \cdots a_n}=0$ since $\epsilon_{a_1 \cdots a_n}$ is totally antisymmetric in its last $n$ indices and $\epsilon^{a_1 \cdots a_n}$ is non-vanishing"". Can anyone expand on the logic of how this implication works? I have tried to interpret this by thinking of $\epsilon^{a_1 \cdots a_n}$ and of $\nabla_j \epsilon_{a_1 \cdots a_n}$, for each fixed $j$, as analogous to two antisymmetric matrices $A$ and $B$ respectively, and the desired statement is then something like
$$ \mathrm{Tr}(A^TB) = 0 \ \Longrightarrow \ B = 0,$$

1748096,Integration by guessing the form of the numerator,"I sometimes see integrands in textbooks with a square in the denominator, like this one:
$$\int\frac{x^2}{\left(x\sin\left(x\right)+\cos\left(x\right)\right)^2} dx$$
Often, these integrands are actually the derivative of a quotient $P(x)/Q(x)$. Since we have the square in the denominator, we already know $Q(x)$. In the example, $Q(x)=x\sin\left(x\right)+\cos\left(x\right)$. Now we have to find a suitable $P(x)$ such that the integrand's numerator ($x^2$) equals $P'(x)\cdot Q(x)-P(x)\cdot Q'(x)$, since that's the numerator of the derivative of $P(x)/Q(x)$. This is basically like Ostrogradsky's method for integrating rational functions, but using polynomials not just in one variable $x$, but in many, e.g. $\{x,\sin(x),\cos(x)\}$. The fact that one might have to apply trigonometric identities to cancel terms (e.g. $\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1$) makes it more complicated. So we try different forms that $P(x)$ might have and use the method of undetermined coefficients. We might for example try $P(x)=A\sin(x)+Bx$ and find that there are no $A$ and $B$ that will work. In the example, the correct form is $P(x)=A\sin(x)+Bx\cos(x)$. The coefficients are $A=1$ and $B=-1$, i.e. we find that $P(x)=\sin(x)-x\cos(x)$ and the antiderivative is: $$\frac{\sin\left(x\right)-x\cos\left(x\right)}{x\sin\left(x\right)+\cos\left(x\right)}+C$$ Now to the actual question: While a computer can easily try hundreds of different forms for $P(x)$ within a short amount of time, doing this manually is painful. Is there any method to narrow down the possible forms of $P(x)$ that one has to try? E.g. can one make reasonable assumptions on: the number of terms that $P(x)$ must have, what kind of terms must appear, or their powers? Or is there maybe a more ""traditional"" approach to solving such integrals?","['indefinite-integrals', 'integration']"
1748103,Counting Squares In a Range,"I've been working on a series of programming challenges to work on my math skills, and I came across a solution that I don't know how to explain. The problem: ""For 1 <= A <= B <= 10^9 , find the number of perfect squares between

Since his book is available on his homepage , I will copy his proof below: Choose a presentation $G=\langle g_\alpha\;|\;r_\beta\rangle$. This exists since every group is a quotient of a free group, so the $g_\alpha$s can be taken to be the generators of this free group with the $r_\beta$s generators of the kernel of the map from the free group to $G$. Now construct $X_G$ from $\bigvee_\alpha S_\alpha^1$ by attaching $2$-cells $e_\beta^2$ by the loops specified by the words $r_\beta$. Which loops are specified here, and where do we attach the $2$-cells? Edit: An example I thought of was a simple case where $G=\langle a, b\;|\;ab\rangle$, then we'd have $S_a^1\vee S_b^1$, and one $2$-cell which should ""wrap around"" both $S^1$? But then $\pi_1(X_G)$ would be trivial (contractible), unlike $G$? Additionally, would there be an algorithm to work backwards, i.e. given a $2$-dimensional cell complex $X_G$ with some conditions (cells are disjoint except for the middle of the wedge), we can obtain $G=\langle g_\alpha\;|\;r_\beta\rangle$?","['algebraic-topology', 'general-topology', 'group-presentation']"

\Delta \equiv & \; d_{\{1,2\}}+d_{\{1,3\}}+d_{\{2,3\}}
\end{align} and, with some algebra, it is easy to verify that the principal minors of $\mathbf{M}$ can be written as \begin{align}
\det(\mathbf{M}_{\{1,2\}}) =& \; \frac{1}{\Delta}\sum_{j\in \{1,2\}}d_j =\; \frac{1}{\Delta}d_{\{1,2\}} \\[2ex]

\det(\mathbf{M}_{\{1\}}) =& \; \frac{1}{\Delta}\sum_{j\in \{\{1,2\},\{1,3\}\}}d_j =\; \frac{1}{\Delta}(d_{\{1,2\}}+d_{\{1,3\}})
\end{align} Moreover, $\det(\mathbf{M}_{\{1,2,3\}}) =0$ follows from the fact that $\det(\mathbf{M}_{\{1,2,3\}})$ is a principal minor of order $3>2=n$. All principal minors of $\mathbf{M}$ of order greater than $n$, are equal to zero, since $\operatorname{rank}(\mathbf{M})=n$. Attempts at the proof using the suggestions by @darijgrinberg Fix $k \in P(K)$ and let $v\equiv |k|$, i.e. the number of elements in $k$. First suppose that $v \gt n$, so that $\det(\mathbf{M}_k)=0$, since $\operatorname{rank}(\mathbf{M}_k)=0$, and $\{ i \in K_n : k \subset i \} = \emptyset$, so that the conjecture holds trivially. Next, suppose that $v \le n$. What follows is tentative. Working with the definition of $\mathbf{M}_{k}$: By definition, $$ \mathbf{M}_{k}=\mathbf{B}_{rk}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})^{-1}\mathbf{A}_{ck} $$ where $\mathbf{B}_{rk}$ and $(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})^{-1}\mathbf{A}_{ck}$ are $(v \times n)$ and $(n \times v)$ matrices respectively. Let $L\equiv \{1,\dots,n\}$ and $L_v$ be the set of subsets of $L$ with $v$ elements, and from the Cauchy-Binet formula we have that $$ \det(\mathbf{M}_{k})=\sum_{j \in L_v}\det\left(\mathbf{B}_{rk,cj}\right)\det\left((\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})_{rj}^{-1}\mathbf{A}_{ck}\right), \tag1$$ and $$	\det\left((\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})_{rj}^{-1}\mathbf{A}_{ck}\right)=\sum_{i \in L_v}\det\left((\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})_{rj,ci}^{-1}\right)\det\left(\mathbf{A}_{ri,ck}\right).$$ So that $$ \det(\mathbf{M}_{k})=\sum_{i,j \in L_v}\det\left((\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})_{rj,ci}^{-1}\right)\det\left(\mathbf{A}_{ri,ck}\right)\det\left(\mathbf{B}_{rk,cj}\right),$$ and since $$ (\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})^{-1}=\frac{1}{\Delta}\operatorname{adj}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}) \implies (\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})_{rj,ci}^{-1}=\frac{1}{\Delta}\operatorname{adj}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})_{rj,ci} $$ it follows that $$ \det(\mathbf{M}_{k})=\frac{1}{\Delta^v} \sum_{i,j \in L_v}\det\left(\operatorname{adj}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})_{rj,ci}\right)\det\left(\mathbf{A}_{ri,ck}\right)\det\left(\mathbf{B}_{rk,cj}\right).$$ Next, for each $i,j \in L_{v}$ define $i'\equiv \{1,\dots,n\}\setminus i$ and $j'\equiv \{1,\dots,n\}\setminus j$, then it follows from Jacobi's theorem that $$ \det(\operatorname{adj}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})_{rj,ci})=(-1)^{\sigma_{ij}}\det(((\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})^{\top})_{rj',ci'})\Delta^{v-1}=(-1)^{\sigma_{ij}}\det(\mathbf{A}_{rj'}\mathbf{B}_{ci'}) $$ where $$ \sigma_{ij} \equiv i_{v+1}'+\cdots+i_{n}'+j_{v+1}'+\cdots+j_{n}' $$ and, therefore, $$ \det(\mathbf{M}_{k})=\frac{1}{\Delta}\sum_{i,j \in L_{v}}(-1)^{\sigma_{ij}}\det(\mathbf{A}_{rj'}\mathbf{B}_{ci'})\det(\mathbf{A}_{ri,ck})\det(\mathbf{B}_{rk,cj}) $$ So far I haven't been able to proceed from here. Working with the conjecture equation: Notice that for any $j \in K_{n}$, $$ \det((\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})^{-1}\mathbf{A}_{cj})=\frac{1}{\Delta}\det(\mathbf{A}_{cj}), $$ so that the conjecture can be rewritten as $$ \det(\mathbf{M}_{k}) = \sum_{j\in \{ i \in K_n : k \subset i \}}\det(\mathbf{B}_{rj})\det((\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})^{-1}\mathbf{A}_{cj}), \tag2$$ which looks similar equation $(1)$, rewritten here for convenience $$ \det(\mathbf{M}_{k})=\sum_{j \in L_v}\det\left(\mathbf{B}_{rk,cj}\right)\det\left((\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})_{rj}^{-1}\mathbf{A}_{ck}\right). $$ I am not sure how to deal with the difference in the indexes between the two equations. My guess is that I will need to use a Laplace expansion to equation $(2)$.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"
1748524,When exactly is a compact complex manifold algebraic?,"It is well known that a necessary and sufficient condition for a compact Kähler manifold $\mathcal{X}$ to be a projective algebraic variety is that it admit a positive holomorphic line bundle $L \rightarrow \mathcal{X}$ . The positivity of $L$ yields a proper holomorphic embedding in projective space and Chow's theorem tells us that the image is cut out by homogeneous polynomials. Here I regard the existence of a positive holomorphic line bundle (meaning a line bundle whose Chern connection has positive curvature) as a differential-geometric condition. Now suppose that $X$ is a smooth, complete variety over $\mathbb{C}$ in the algebraic category, where $X$ is not necessarily projective. We have an analytification functor (à la Serre's GAGA) which when applied to $X$ yields a compact complex manifold $X^{an}$ . In this way, we can think of $X^{an}$ as algebraic in the complex category. Note of course that $X^{an}$ need not be projective, nor even Kähler. Hironaka's example yields non-Kähler examples. My question is: Is there some differential-geometric condition that tests when a
compact complex manifold $\mathcal{X}$ is algebraic (i.e. $\mathcal{X} = X^{an}$ is the analytification of a smooth complete variety $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$ )? We know in particular that such an $\mathcal{X}$ will be a Moishezon manifold (its algebraic dimension $a(\mathcal{X})$ equals $\mbox{dim}_{\mathbb{C}}$ ( $\mathcal{X}$ )) but it is known that there are Moishezon manifolds that are not algebraic (i.e. not the analytification of a variety), so the condition of being Moishezon is not sufficient. That said, it is known (due to Artin) that every Moishezon manifold is the analytification of a proper algebraic space , which is defined here by Wikipedia and is a generalization of a scheme. So my question asks for a differential-geometric condition which is almost 'parallel' to asking when an algebraic space is in fact a scheme.","['complex-manifolds', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

1748549,Rolling a die until two rolls sum to seven,"Here's the question: You have a standard six-sided die and you roll it repeatedly, writing
  down the numbers that come up, and you win when two of your rolled
  numbers add up to $7$. (You will almost surely win.) Necessarily, one of the
  winning summands is the number rolled on the winning turn. A typical
  game could go like this: $1, 1, 4, 5, 3$; you win on the 5 th turn
  because $3 + 4 = 7$. How many turns do you expect to play? Here's what I've tried: 
We seek $E(N)$ where $N$ is a random variable counting the number of turns it takes to win. Then $N \ge 2$, and $$E(N) = \sum_{n=2}^\infty n P(N=n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty P(N > n).$$
I want to find either $P(N=n)$, the probability that I win on the $n$ th turn, or $P(N > n)$, the probability that after $n$ turns I still haven't won. Note that $P(N = 1) = 0$. Let $X_k$ be the number rolled on the $k$ th turn. Then $$P(N = 2) = P(X_1 + X_2 = 7) = \sum_{x=1}^6 P(X_1 = x)P(X_2 = 7-x) = 6\cdot \frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{6}.$$
So far so good. To compute $P(N > 3)$ I let $A_{i, j} = \{\omega \in \{1, \dotsc, 6\}^3 : w_i + w_j = 7\}$ and used the inclusion-exclusion principle and symmetry to find $$|A_{1,2} \cup A_{2,3} \cup A_{1,3}| = 3|A_{1,2}| - 3|A_{1,2}\cap A_{1,3}| = 90$$
so $P(N > 3) = \frac{126}{216} = \frac{7}{12}$. This is the probability that no two of three dice sum to seven. Similarly, I found $P(N > 4)$ to be $\frac{77}{216}$. I don't see how to generalize the above. I also thought that $$P(N > n) = P(X_i + X_j \ne 7 \text{ for all }1 \le i\ne j \le n) = (1 - P(X_i + X_j = 7))^{\binom{n}{2}} = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{n(n-1)/2}$$ 
but that's false because the events are not independent. I also tried $$P(N = n) = P(X_n = 7 - X_k \text{ for some } 1 \le k < n \text{ and }N \ne n - 1)$$
where that last clause is shorthand for ""and the previous rolls did not secure your victory"". 
This yields the recursion $p_n = (1-(5/6)^{n-1})(1-p_{n-1})$, $p_1 = 0$, which didn't agree with my previously computed probabilities. (Perhaps I made an error.)","['expectation', 'probability', 'dice']"

Now here is my thought process so far: $X_i$ = the time at which the $i$th large pill is chosen and then broken. Then
$X = \sum_{i = 1}^{48}X_i$, so $\operatorname{E}(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^{48}\operatorname{E}(X_i)$.

1748768,What is the advantage of Borel sigma algebras in defining probability spaces?,"I'm trying to get the central concepts correct, so I'm going to express them without embellishment. A Borel $\sigma$ algebra is defined as a sigma algebra generated by a topological space
    $(M,\mathcal{T})$. If $M$ is $\mathbb{R}$, it will typically
    be the ""standard topology"" defined as the set of all open intervals. Because a $\sigma$ algebra is closed under intersection of infinitely-countably many sub-sets, we can prove that $\displaystyle\bigcap_{n\geq1}(a -\frac{1}{n},\,b)= [a,b)$. This step would not be possible within the topological space where only finite intersections are allowed. So we ""recover"" closed and half-closed intervals, thanks to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra. Now, the half-open intervals are in the sigma algebra (and so are closed intervals), and can be assigned a measure. So we went through quite a bit of maneuvering (assuming all this is correct) for what purpose? In particular, if we focus on probability spaces, the probability of a close interval is the same as an open interval, since the probability of any point in the real line is zero. Here is a tentative, unsophisticated, and crass way of looking at it (I'm posting it here to get further feedback): We can't assign a probability measure to $[0,1]$ because of Cantor's different types of infinites, and $2^Ω$ of $[0,1]$ being far too big, etc. But we want a smooth domain, so that we can get a nice $pdf$ to integrate over... Solution: start with the standard topology over the real line, and then ""fill"" the gaps by turning it into a sigma algebra.

1748789,"Primes of the form $(2p)^{2}+1$, $p$ prime, have $h^{2}+1$ as a prime divisor?","I'm an undergraduate student and I usually ask questions here about things I'm struggling with in my academical mathematical studies, but this particular question is actually more like a curiosity. More specifically, I'm playing around with that ""famous"" problem of creating a sequence that only generates prime numbers. I know that many people have tried this and it is a very hard problem, but this is part of mathematics, right? I mean, attacking hard problems as a (yet) naive student at the very least to make you realize how difficult they actually are and hopefully motivates for further study on the issue. Feel free to say that I'm wasting my time, though. So, to the question: I realized that the numbers $N$ of the form $N=(2p)^{2}+1$, where $p$ is prime, are often prime numbers (at least for small $p)$. This is sort of justified by the fact that it will never by divisible by a prime $q\equiv 3\pmod 4$, since it would imply that $-1$ is a quadratic residue mod $q$. Hence, all its prime divisors are $\equiv 1\pmod 4$, and in particular, all of its divisors are of this form, since $1\cdot 1\equiv 1\pmod 4$. Now, I thought of that famous result that says that any prime $\equiv 1\pmod 4$ can be written as a sum of two squares of integers, and hence such a number $N$ would be of the form (in prime factorization)
\begin{equation}
N=(a^{2}+b^{2})(c^{2}+d^{2})\dots(x^{2}+y^{2}).
\end{equation} My question (for now, since I've just started these investigations), is: Is it true that, when $N$ is not prime, one of these prime factors will always be the form $h^{2}+1$? This is happening in my particular examples. I guess this is a hard question, and I'd appreciate any efforts, or references. Thanks.","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1748834,An automorphism that has no fixed points except for the identity and is its own inverse implies commutativity,"Let $G$ be a finite group and suppose there exists $f\in\text{Aut}(G)$ such that $f^2=\text{id}_G$, i.e., $f$ is its own inverse, and such that $f$ has no fixed points other than the identity $e$ of $G$, i.e., $f(x)=x\Rightarrow x=e$. Show that $G$ is necessarily abelian. While trying to do this exercise I noticed two facts. First, $g$ and $f(g)$ have the same order because $o(f(g))|o(g)$ and, applying $f$ again and using $f^2=\text{id}_G$, $o(f(f(g)))=o(g)|o(f(g))$ and, once the order of any element is $\geq 1$, it follows that $o(g)=o(f(g))$. Also, it's easy to see that $g$ and $f(g)$ commute. Second, there cannot exist such an automorphism if the order of $G$ is even, because $f(e)=e$ and we can form pairs like $\{g,f(g)\}$ with $f(g)\neq g$ that are invariant under $f$, i.e., $f(\{g,f(g)\})=\{g,f(g)\}$. But once the order of $G$ is even, proceeding with the construction of the pairs, we'll end up with just one element $\neq e$, so we must have some $\gamma\in G\setminus{e}$ with $f(\gamma)=\gamma$, contradicting the hypothesis. Let $n$ be the order of $G$ and let's fix an enumeration of the elements of $G$, say $G=\{g_1,\ldots,g_n\}$. My approach was the following. For each $\sigma\in S_n$, let $x_{\sigma}=\prod_{i=1}^ng_{\sigma(i)}$. Then we have that $f(x_{\sigma})=x_{\sigma^{\prime}}$. If it's shown that $f(x_{\sigma})=e\;\forall\;\sigma\in S_n$, then we'd have $x_{\sigma}=e\;\forall\;\sigma\in S_n$, which implies that $G$ is abelian. The problem is that $S_n$ has $n!$ elements while $G$ has $n$ elements, so there repetitions among the $x_{\sigma}$, and we cannot apply directly the reasoning of the last paragraph.

1748861,Does every non-Archimedean absolute value satisfy the ultrametric inequality?,"The Archimedean property occurs in various areas of mathematics; for instance it is defined for ordered groups, ordered fields, partially ordered vector spaces and normed fields. In each of these contexts it is roughly the following property: Archimedean property. For any two (strictly) positive elements $x$ and $y$ there is some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $n \cdot x$ exceeds $y$. This definition might not be adequate in each of the mentioned contexts, but at least it conveys the general idea. Indeed, in the context of normed fields we have the following definition (paraphrasing the definition given on Wikipedia): Definition. Let $F$ be a field with an absolute value $\left|\:\cdot\:\right|$, that is, a function $\left|\:\cdot\:\right| : F \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ satisfying the following properties: $|x| = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$; For all $x,y\in F$ we have $|xy| = |x|\cdot |y|$; For all $x,y\in F$ we have $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$. Then $F$ is said to be Archimedean if for any non-zero $x\in F$ there exists some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
  $$ \big|\:\underbrace{x + \cdots + x}_{n\ \text{times}}\:\big| > 1. $$
  An absolute value that does not satisfy this property is called non-Archimedean . However, in the literature the term non-Archimedean absolute value is usually used as a synonym for an absolute value which satisfies the ultrametric inequality: For any $x,y\in F$ we have $|x + y| \leq \max(|x|,|y|)$. It is not so hard to see that an ultrametric absolute value can never be Archimedean: one easily proves that $|1| = 1$ holds, and then we find $|1 + 1| \leq 1$, followed by $|1 + 1 + 1| \leq 1$ and so on (repeatedly using the ultrametric inequality). It is however not so clear to me that any non-Archimedean absolute value must necessarily satisfy the ultrametric inequaltiy. Is this always true?

1748991,Convergence of $\int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{(1+x^2)^m}dx$,"Suppose we have an integral of the form $$I(n,m):= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{(1+x^2)^m}dx$$ Most of my test cases computed seem to indicate if $n\geq 2m-1$, then this integral diverges. I have a non-rigorous justification for this: just expand the bottom and look at leading terms. If we ignore lower order terms as we move towards $\infty$, the integrand will be of order $x^{n-2m}$. If $n= 2m-1$, then this will be $x^{-1}$, whose integral diverges here, and similarly for $n>2m-1$, whereas for $n<2m-1$, the integrand behave like $x^{-2}$ or greater negative powers, which will converge. This is all very nice intuitively, but I'm wondering if anyone has a more rigorous, formal approach to this? Here's a related question, of which this is a generalization.","['improper-integrals', 'integration', 'calculus']"
1749007,How to compute $\int \frac{1}{(x^2+1)^2}dx$?,Suppose we know $\int \frac{1-x^2}{(x^2+1)^2}=\frac{x}{x^2+1}+C$ How to compute $\int \frac{1}{(x^2+1)^2}dx$? I tried writing it as $\frac{1+x^2-x^2}{(x^2+1)^2}=\frac{1-x^2}{(x^2+1)^2}+\frac{x^2}{(x^2+1)^2}$. But then how do you deal with $\frac{x^2}{(x^2+1)^2}$? Some ideas?,"['partial-fractions', 'integration', 'calculus']"
