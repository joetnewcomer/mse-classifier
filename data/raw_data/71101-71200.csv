870219,Sum of $k$-combination with repetitions [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : How to simplify $\sum_{i=1}^{k}\binom{n + i - 1}{i}$? [duplicate] (1 answer) Closed 4 months ago . The community reviewed whether to reopen this question 4 months ago and left it closed: Original close reason(s) were not resolved I can see that there are $\binom{n+k-1}{k}$ cases of choosing k items of n types with repetition from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset_coefficient#Counting_multisets . I wonder whether there is any formula about its sum for varying $k$ .
In particular, I am interested in $\sum_{k=1}^{N} \binom{n+k-1}{k}$ . Does anyone have an idea, or a link about this or anything similar to this one? Update: I changed $nk$ to $N$ . Actually $N = np$ for some positive integer $p$ , but I think this is not necessary. Remark This question was closed for being a duplicate of How to simplify $\sum_{i=1}^{k}\binom{n + i - 1}{i}$? .

870234,Ext functor commutes with connecting homomorphisms?,"Suppose we have an exact sequence $0 \to L \to M \to N \to 0$ and a morphism $f \colon A \to B$ of $R$-modules.

(Northcott, An introduction to homological algebra , pp. 115, theorem 10). So this would solve my question if I knew that $\psi^{i}(C) = \text{Ext}^{i}(f,C)$ for all $R$-modules $C$. Now this is probably true.. but I don't see why. The maps $\text{Ext}^{i}(f,C)$ (as I know) are defined by taking injective resolutions of $B$ and $A$ , then taking the chain map induced by $f$ and applying $\text{Hom}(-,C)$ and then cohomology.. now if we define them this way... why would they commute with the connecting homomorphism as in $(*)$?","['derived-functors', 'homological-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

870251,Theoretical computer science text for high-school student,"I am a high school student, I know some basic programming in java,python and visual basic. I love combinatorics and I have encountered various cases in which I have found some problems are really hard, and that's that. Sometimes I am told the problem is NP-complete or #P hard or something like that, and apparently that means there's nothing we can do about it. I have also heard about things like Turing machines, Oracle machines and busy beavers and Halting problem, This sounds like it is very interesting but I don't get it. I would like some textbooks which explain all of these concepts to a mathematician, the less it has to do with actual computers (like the one I'm typing in right now) the better, I want to learn from a mathematicians point of view. An ideal book would be one which assumes I don't know much about computers but have a decent understanding of math.

870253,Do the centers of mass of the whole $n$-sphere and its half coincide when $n \to \infty$?,"It is known that the distance between the centroid (center of mass) and the center of a unit semicircle is $\displaystyle\frac{4}{3\pi}$, whereas that of a unit hemisphere is $\displaystyle\frac{3}{8}$. I am interested in determining a closed general formula for the centroid of a unit n-hemisphere. I did some calculations and obtained $$\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{\Gamma{(\frac{n+2}{2}})}{\Gamma{(\frac{n+3}{2}})}$$ which for $n=1, 2, 3, 4....$ gives the values $\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}, \frac{4}{3\pi},\frac{3}{8},\frac{16}{15\pi}....$. I obtained this formula using the Pappus' centroid theorem for the volume of solids of revolution, but would be happy to have confirmation of this by a proof based on integral calculations. I found a previous question on this topic, but no closed form expression was provided in the answer. If confirmed, an interesting and somewhat unexpected consequence of this formula would be that because $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{\Gamma{(\frac{n+2}{2}})}{\Gamma{(\frac{n+3}{2}})}=0$$
then the centroid of a n-hemisphere and that of the whole n-sphere tend to coincide as $n$ increases. Is this interpretation correct? Any hint would be very appreciated.","['geometry', 'centroid', 'gamma-function', 'circles', 'limits']"

870265,"Find intermediate fields of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt{3},i) \, | \, \mathbb{Q}(i)$","This is the problem I am facing: Compute the intermediate fields of the extension $K | \mathbb{Q}(i)$

$$ \sqrt[3]{2} \to \{\sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[3]{2} \, \xi, \sqrt[3]{2} \, \xi ^2 \}$$ The extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt{3},i) \, | \, \mathbb{Q}(i)$ is a Galois extension (it is normal(splitting field of $(x^3-2)(x^2-3)$, separable (char($\mathbb{Q}(i)$) = 0) and finite) so $| \textrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt{3},i) \, | \, \mathbb{Q}(i)) | = 6$ which means that all the options are valid.

870300,A riddle with a witch and some gnomes (guessing numbers on hats),"My question concerns a variation and a generalization of the following riddle. The Original Riddle: A wicked witch kidnaps 2 gnomes. She paralyzes them, and places a hat on each of their heads. Each hat either has the number $1$ or the number $2$ written on it (both hats may have the same number). She then places the gnomes so they face each other (each gnome sees the number on the other gnome's hat). Afterwards, she puts the gnomes in separate rooms, where she undoes the paralysis, and asks each of the gnomes to guess which number is written on their own hat. If at least one of the gnomes guesses right, she'll let them go, otherwise she'll use them to make a gnome-stew. Luckily for the gnomes, they knew about the witch's plan, and they planned ahead. They prepared a strategy that will always guarantee that at least one of them guesses right. What was their strategy? Solution: The first gnome (call him gnome $A$), will always select the opposite of what he saw on the second gnome's (call him gnome $B$) hat, while gnome $B$ will always select the same value that he saw on gnome $A$'s hat. Putting this strategy in a truth table shows that it always works:
$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
\text{Gnome A's Hat} & \text{Gnome B's Hat} & \text{Gnome A's Guess} & \text{Gnome B's Guess} \\
\hline
1 & \color{lime}1 & 2 & \color{lime}{1} \\
\color{lime}1 & 2 & \color{lime}1 & 1 \\
\color{lime}2 & 1 & \color{lime}2 & 2 \\
2 & \color{lime}2 & 1 & \color{lime}2 \\
\end{array}
$$ One can also give a more intuitive explanation for the solution: Gnome $A$ gambles that both gnomes have different valued numbers on their hats, while gnome $B$ gambles that both gnomes have equal values numbers in their hats. Since these are the only possibilities, at least one of them must be correct. A  Variation: How can the riddle be solved with 3 gnomes, and hats with 3 values ($1$, $2$ and $3$), where each of the gnomes sees the values on the other two gnomes' hats? And is there an intuitive explanation for the solution? Partial Answer: Trying out some values I found the following strategy solves the problem for 3 gnomes:

I can figure this out for $n = 2$, since the solution is quite intuitive: simply combine the first element with every other element, combine the second element with every other element that comes after it, etc. For a set of length $L$, this yields: $$\sum_{x=1}^{L-1}(L - x)$$ (from Wolfram Alpha ) which is much smaller and more manageable.

870502,Why is tensor product of linear maps defined as $(S\otimes T)(v\otimes w)=S(v)\otimes T(w)$?,"In my understanding, the definition of tensor product of linear maps cannot be directly derived from the definition of tensor product of vector spaces (or modules), since it's not clear what is the domain, range, and the map of the result product. Originally I thought this is just a definition. But then I learned that if we represent $S$ and $T$ by matrices, then the matrix describing the tensor product $S \otimes T$ is the Kronecker product of the two matrices. However, Kronecker product of matrices can be developed totally without the concept of tensor product of linear maps. For example, we can find basis of the matrix spaces (say $V$ and $W$). Then we can get natural basis for $V \otimes W$. And we can easily get the definition of Kronecker product from these basis. So my question is: is this coincidence just a coincidence or there is some deep reason behind the definition so that it has to be defined like this. I can't even see why the domain of $S \otimes T$ should be $V\otimes W$, given $S$ and $T$ are linear maps over $V$ and $W$. (I know that the definition of tensor product of linear maps is very natural, and I can't imagine other definitions of it. I just thought there must be a formal reason that the definition has to be that. )","['tensor-products', 'linear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

I have literally never encountered anything that is useful in engineering that do not satisfy this condition. Therefore you can see why I am so curious as to why so many people are incline to say ""suppose $f$ is $L^2$"" before they prove something.

870574,"Dirichlet problem in the disk: behavior of conjugate function, and the effect of discontinuities","Dirichlet's problem in the unit disk is to construct the harmonic function from the given continuous function on the boundary circle. It is solved by the convolution with the Poisson kernel, and we know that the constructed function has uniform limit which is the given continuous function as $r\to 1$, and we can complexify the solution by taking the Schwarz integral formula. Now (in this very particular case) does the imaginary part has a uniform limit ?
If it does, why don't we prove the uniqueness of the solution by a simple application of the Cauchy integral formula ? Here is the proof that I reckon to be reasonable(which is what I expose here to be criticised) We construct the Schwarz integral, or
$\frac{1}{2\pi}\int _{0}^{2\pi}\frac{\exp(it)+z}{\exp{(it)}-z}u(\exp{(it)})\mathrm{d}t$.
This function is an analytic function in the interior unit disk, and is continuous in the closed unit disk(its closure). Let this analytic function denoted by $f$, and another analytic function that has the same uniform limit function on the circle be $v$. Then $u-v$ is an complex analytic function in the interior of the unit disk, continuous on the closure, with boundary value identically zero. An application of Cauchy's integral formula gives rise to the conclusion that $u-v$ in identically zero on the entire disk. Another question being if the boundary function has finite jump discontinuities, what is the behaviour of the convolution with the Poisson kernel near the discontinuous points ?","['harmonic-functions', 'fourier-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations', 'complex-analysis']"

\int_Y^*\mathscr{H}^k(A\cap f^{-1}\{y\})d\mathscr{H}^m(y)\leq (\mathrm{Lip} f)^m \frac{\alpha(k)\alpha(m)}{\alpha(k+m)}\mathscr{H}^{k+m}(A).
$$ (where $\mathscr{H}^n$ is the Hausdorff measure associated to the metrics on $X$ and $Y$, and $\int^*$ is the upper integral) provided either $\{y\in Y, \mathscr{H}^k(A\cap f^{-1})>0\}$
 is the union of countable family of sets with finite $\mathscr{H}^m$ measure, or $Y$ is boundedly compact (each close bounded subset is compact). The question Federer asks is to determine if everything after ""provided either..."" is necessary. The other question is about currents : let $S$, $T$ be two currents on open subsets $A$,$B$ of euclidean spaces, of degree $i$ and $j$ : if $S$, $T$ are representable by integration, do we always have $\Vert S\times T\Vert=\Vert S\Vert\times\Vert T\Vert$, and $\overrightarrow{S\times T}(a,b)=(\wedge_i p)\overrightarrow{S}(a)\wedge(\wedge_j q)\overrightarrow{T}(b)$ for $\Vert S\times T\Vert$ almost all $(a,b)\in A\times B$, where $p:A\rightarrow A\times B$ and $q:B\rightarrow A\times B$ are the canonical injections (it is indeed the case if either $\overrightarrow{S}$ or $\overrightarrow{T}$ is simple $\Vert S\Vert\times\Vert T\Vert$ almost everywhere).","['geometric-measure-theory', 'measure-theory', 'integration']"
870926,Definition of strong mixing and definition of measure-preserving,"I have a few questions regarding measure-preserving dynamical systems $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu,T)$. 1) The definition of measure preserving is always stated as $$\mu(T^{-1}B)=\mu(B),$$ for all $B$. I believe this neither implies nor is implied by the similar statement $$\mu(TB)=\mu(B).$$ Is this correct? The problem lies in the fact that  $TT^{-1}B \subseteq B \subseteq T^{-1}TB$ may be strict inclusions, so the following implications may not hold: $$\mu(T^{-1} TB) = \mu(TB) \implies \mu(B)=\mu(TB)$$ and $$\mu(TT^{-1}B)= \mu(T^{-1}B) \implies \mu(B)=\mu(T^{-1}B).$$ 2) Is there some ""reason"" why the above definition involves $T^{-1}$ rather than $T$? 3) The definition of strong mixing is
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \mu(A \cap T^{-n}B) = \mu(A) \mu(B)$$

But $d(n)=(\alpha_1+1)(\alpha_2+1)...(\alpha_m+1)$ when we define $n=p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}...p_m^{\alpha_m}$.  So $m<k$. Now the divisors of $n$ are just the product of prime powers with some combination of the primes/prime powers removed.  For example, a divisor, $d_i=\frac{n}{p_j^{\alpha_l}}$.  The product of these divisors will yield $n^k$ in the numerator, and $n^i$ in the denominator with $i<k$ since the denominator will contain all $p_j^{\alpha_j}$.

Then the problem is to show that there exist open sets $P \in U \subset X, Q \in V \subset Y$ and an isomorphism $U \cong V$ that takes $P$ to $Q$ . The solution given in http://math.berkeley.edu/~reb/courses/256A/1.4.pdf proceeds as follows: Let $f:\mathcal{O}_{Q,Y} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{P,X}$ be the isomorphism of local rings. We can consider $X,Y$ to be affine varieties of the same affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$ . Moreover, we can take $P=Q=0$ . Let $y_1,\dots,y_n$ be the coordinate functions on $\mathbb{A}^n$ . Since $y_i$ is a regular function on $Y$ , then it can be viewed as an element of the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{Q,Y}$ , say $\langle V_i, y_i \rangle$ . Under $f$ it is taken to a germ $\langle U_i, f(y_i) \rangle$ . Define the open set $U$ of $X$ by $U = \cap_i U_i$ . Then we can define a morphism $f^*: U \rightarrow Y$ by sending $(a_1,\dots,a_n) \in X$ to $(f(y_1)(a_1,\dots,a_n),\dots,f(y_n)(a_1,\dots,a_n))$ . The solution then says that likewise we can define a morphism $g^*:V \rightarrow X$ on an open set $V$ of $Y$ and the composition of the two morphisms is the identity wherever it is defined. Question 1: How exactly is $g^*$ defined? If i define it in the same manner as $f^*$ then i don't see why i get the identity. Question 2: Why can we even compose $g^*$ and $f^*$ ?

Since $m(C^{c}) = 1$, $$1 = m\left(\bigcup_{I \in C^{c}}I\right) = \sum_{I \in C^{c}}m(I) = \sum_{I \in C^{c}}m^{\ast}(\psi(I))$$ but the expression on the right hand side is $\geq m^{\ast}(\psi(C^{c}))$ by countable subadditivity of $m^{\ast}$.","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

My guess is $F=F_1\cdots F_n +1$ which clearly is monic, but I'm having problems to proof the irreducibility part.

871420,Non-Linear Ordinary Differential Equation in Fluid Dynamics,"So while trying to model the physics of a rocket shot from the ground through the atmosphere, I came up with a second-order Non-Linear ODE of the form: $$
\ddot y + \dot y^2 e^y = f(t)
$$ This is simplified, of course, but I have been searching and cannot determine a solution or if there even IS an analytic solution. Of course, maybe from my short description of the problem you already see that I am taking the wrong approach entirely; if so, please direct me to the right line of thinking. So in summary: Is there an analytic solution to this equation? If so, what is it? If not, how should I approach this problem given certain initial values to get a numeric solution? Thanks very much in advance.","['fluid-dynamics', 'nonlinear-system', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
871453,What distinguishes elliptical coordinates from polar coordinates?,"I am trying to identify what characteristic distinguishes elliptical
coordinates from polar coordinates. For concreteness, let's write down
the expressions. Polar: $$
x=r \cos(t) \\
y=r \sin(t)
$$ Elliptical: $$
x=a \cosh(r) \cos(t) \\
y=a \sinh(r) \sin(t)
$$ (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_coordinate_system ) The most obvious distinction is that the ""normal"" lines to the ellipses
are not straight lines but curved (in fact confocal parabolas). Another way to say it is that for polar coordinates the normal vector
$(dx/dr,dy/dr)$ depends on $t$ only, not on $r$, and is thus normal to all
circles (any $r$), whereas for elliptical coordinates the normal vector
depends on both $r$ and $t$, so is normal to the ellipse for a specific $r$ and $t$. So my questions are: Is this a good characterization of the difference, and is it possible
to state it in a more insightful manner in a larger context? Is there a different or better way to characterize the difference? Is there a name for it?","['coordinate-systems', 'polar-coordinates', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
871463,"How do we check conformal equivalence of parametrized surfaces, e.g. parallel surfaces?","Suppose we have two parametrized surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$:
$$
X,Y:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3
$$ The induced metric on either surface is the pullback of the Euclidean metric $\bar g$ due to the inclusion map:
$$
g_X = X^\ast \bar g, \quad g_Y = Y^\ast \bar g
$$ To check if $X$ and $Y$ are conformally equivalent, can we directly compare $g_X$ and $g_Y$, since they both are defined on $T\mathbb{R}^2$, or do we need to find out the a diffeomorphism $\varphi$ (if it exists) from $X$ to $Y$ and then compare $\varphi^\ast g_Y$ and $g_X$? Addendum: Thanks to This is much healthier for the clarifying comment. I have slightly edited my question above due to this. The specific case I am interested in is of parallel surfaces :
$$
Y(u,v) = X(u,v) + aN(u,v)
$$ Let us assume that $X$ is convex, e.g. an ellipsoid, and $N$ is the ""outward"" normal, i.e. the surface curves away from $N$. Is it possible to determine for this case if the surfaces are conformal or not? One can show that 
$$
g_Y = Q^T g_X Q
$$
where $Q$ is the change-of-basis matrix from $\{X_u,X_v\}\ (\equiv X_\ast)$ to $\{Y_u,Y_v\}\ (\equiv Y_\ast)$. Does this help in any way in deciding conformality?","['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'conformal-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds', 'surfaces']"
871470,Convergence of Euler-transformed zeta series,"I am trying to prove that the expression $$(1-2^{1-s})\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{m=0}^n\frac{(-1)^m}{2^{n+1}}{n\choose m}(m+1)^{-s}$$ converges to an analytic continuation of the alternating zeta function for all $s\in\Bbb C\setminus\{1\}$, following the paper by Sondow . My strategy is to show that this ""Euler transformation"" of the original series, $$(1-2^{1-s})\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^{n-1}n^{-s},$$ which is convergent for $\Re s>0$, can be achieved by repeatedly applying the transformation $$a_1-a_2+a_3-\dots=\frac12a_1+\frac12[(a_1-a_2)-(a_2-a_3)+(a_3-a_4)-\cdots],$$ which after $k$ transformations extends the region of convergence to $\Re s>-k$, so that the limit sequence is convergent everywhere. The general term after $k$ transformations of the alternating zeta function is: $$(1-2^{1-s})\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^n\frac{(-1)^m}{2^{n+1}}{n\choose m}(m+1)^{-s}+\frac1{2^k}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sum_{m=0}^k(-1)^{n+m-1}{k\choose m}(m+n)^{-s}$$ Now it follows from the alternating series test that for $k=0$, the original series is convergent for $\Re s>0$, but in order to apply the alternating series test on the transformed series, I need to know that $$\sum_{m=0}^k(-1)^{m-1}{k\choose m}(m+n)^{-s}\ge0\tag{1}$$
$$\sum_{m=0}^k(-1)^{m-1}{k\choose m}(m+n+1)^{-s}\le\sum_{m=0}^k(-1)^{m-1}{k\choose m}(m+n)^{-s}.\tag{2}$$ Now $(1)$ for $k$ follows from $(2)$ for $k-1$, but verifying $(2)$ is not at all obvious to me.

I'm really lost in this question. After hours of just thinking and having no progress, I looked at the answer key, and still lost. So I will give you the books answer key and point out where I'm lost. Book's Solution: By symmetry we need to prove only the first statement. Let $A$ be one of the people. Either $A$ has at least four friends, or $A$ has at least six enemies among the other nine people (since $3 + 5 < 9$). Suppose, in the first case, $B, C,D, E$ are all $A$'s friends. If any two of these are friends with each other, then we have found three mutual friends. Otherwise $\{B, C, D, E\}$ is a set of four mutual enemies of $A$. By Example 11, among $B, C, D, E, F, G$ there are either three mutual friends or three mutual enemies, who form with $A$, a set of four mutual enemies. One can ignore the last sentence, it's basically saying that in 6 people, there are either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual enemies, which I completely understand already. My Problem: The proof actually make sense, except for the part where they said ""Either A has at least 4 friends, or A has at least six enemies among the other nine people (since 3 + 5 < 9)"" , that 's the part thats bothering me. Where did they get the number $4$? I mean, by pigeon hole principle, $A$ has at lest $\lceil \dfrac{9}{2}\rceil = 5$ enemies or friends (not both of course).
