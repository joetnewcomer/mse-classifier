714564,if $f'''(x)$ is continuous everywhere and $\lim_{x \to 0}(1+x+ \frac{f(x)}{x})^{1/x}=e^3$ Compute $f''(0)$,"if $f'''(x)$ is continuous everywhere and $$\lim_{x \to 0}(1+x+ \frac{f(x)}{x})^{1/x}=e^3$$ Compute $f''(0)$ The limit equals to $$\begin{align} \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\log(1+x+ \frac{f(x)}{x})}{x}-3=0.  \end{align}$$ 
From $$\frac{\log(1+x+ \frac{f(x)}{x})}{x}-3=o(1)$$ as $x \to 0$, I get $$1+x+\frac{f(x)}{x} = e^{3x+o(x)},$$ and  $$f(x)=x(e^{3x+o(x)}-x-1),\frac{f(x)}{x}=e^{3x+o(x)}-x-1$$ as $x \to 0$. So both $f(0)$ and $f'(0)$ are $0$. Approximating $e^{3x+o(x)}=1+3x+o(x)$ I get $$\begin{align} f(x) &= x(1+3x+o(x)-x-1) =2x^2+o(x^2). \end{align}$$
Now I try to use the definition of derivative to calculate the $f''(x)$ 
$$f''(x)=\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{f'(x)-f'(0)}{x}=\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{f'(x)}{x}$$
I'm not sure whether I can get $f'(x)$ by differentiating the approximation $2x^2+o(x^2)$ and how to differentiate $o(x^2)$.","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'limits']"
714579,Bijective immersion is a diffeomorphism,"Let $\psi:M\longrightarrow N$ be $C^\infty$, bijective immersion, the $\psi$ is a diffeomorphism. I am having trouble in proving this statement. What I have done so far is this : By inverse function theorem, it is enough to prove $d\psi:M_m\longrightarrow N_{\psi(m)}$ is an isomorphism $\forall\ m\in M$. We already have that $d\psi$ is injective for all $m$. So it is enough to prove that $d\psi$ is surjective $\forall\ m\in M$. Suppose there is a point in $M$ where $d\psi$ is not surjective, then this means that $dim\ M=p<d=dim\ N$. Let $(U,\phi)$ be a coordinate system on $N$ such that $\phi(U)= \mathbb{R}^d$. Since $\psi$ maps $M$ onto $N$, $\phi\circ\psi(M)=\mathbb{R}^d$. Now I am supposed to get a contradiction from this by proving range $\phi\circ\psi$ has measure zero in $\mathbb{R}^d$, or by any other means (for which the second countability of $M$ is crucial). But I am not able to get this. Any help will be appreciated!","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

714663,Why limits work,"I'm currently a first year student in electrical engineering and computer science. I know how to compute limits, derivatives, integrals with respect to one variable that is things from one variable calculus (mathematics 1). In mathematics 2 we're currently working on series (convergent, divergent, integral criteria, D'Alemberts criteria, Cauchy criteria, absolute convergence ...). English is not my mother tongue, so forgive me I spell something wrong or have grammar mistakes. I'll try to explain my questions as best as I can. I have multiple questions, but they are all intertwined. Since all these things ""need"" limits, they are my main confusion. I understand the intuition behind the limit and the epsilon-delta definition, but why it works in practice. That is why can I say when computing the derivative of for example $x^2$ is $2x$? In $\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}  \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}$ I can't just put $0$ since I would get $\frac{0}{0}$, which would be the ""true"" derivative, because I don't know what that is. After some manipulation I would get $\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} 2x + \Delta x$ and since $\Delta x$ goes to $0$ that would be equal to $2x$. But this $\Delta x$ will never be $0$, at least as I look at this and from the definition of the limit it would say that I can make $\Delta x$ as close to $0$, but not equal to, if I'm willing to make $x_1$ and $x_2$ as close to each other. Why can I now take this $2x$ and say for instance that the derivative of someone's position it time is $2x$ that is its velocity is $2x$ and not $2x +$ some small $\Delta x$? When trying to see if an infinite series (which never ends) converges or diverges why can I look at a sequence of partial sums (infinite) of that series and based on their convergence or divergence say if the whole series diverges or converges? When I come to professors and ask these and such questions they tell me why am I bothering my self with such question and that I should take it for granted. Then I just want to kill my self. I mean haven't I came here to study how and why things work? I would like it more if they would just tell me that if it is some ""higher"" or more complex part of mathematics and that I will learn about it later or that it just isn't know why it works the way it works. So should I even continue to study these things, since I will always come across something that I wouldn't be able to understand (since these ""basic"" limits are confusing me) and all these professors and academia will tell me that I shouldn't worry why it works the way it works and that I should just take it for granted. All the theorems used to proof derivative, integral, convergence, divergence etc. use in one way or another limits. But in the definition of the limit it says that I can make some $f(x)$ as close to some value L, but not equal to it, as long as I'm willing to make $x$ as close to some value $c$. This definition is supposed to be mathematical rigorous, but using these as close don't ""look"" rigorous to me. Please help me since I don't know should I even continue with my studies since there is always some mathematical proof which I cannot understand and is preventing me to go forward and that way I'm always lacking behind and everybody expects to understand everything the first time I hear it. I will be grateful for all comments and suggestions.","['calculus', 'education', 'soft-question', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

At first glance, it seems obvious that there would be less ideals than elements of a ring. But the ideals are not necessarily mutually disjoint, and they form a subset of the power set of the ring, which is strictly larger than the ring itself. I know fields only have trivial ideals, so maybe there is an ""opposite"" structure that has a maximal proliferation of ideals relative to elements?

714725,Help understanding interaction and effect.,I am reading a research paper in which the authors designed three bots and wanted to determine what bot was most human-like (link is at the bottom). To do this they had subjects play against each bot and answer questions about each bots performance. The questions where answered on a scale of -2 to 2 where -2 was strongly disagree and 2 was strongly agree. Once all the subjects answered the questions the authors averaged all of the responses and plotted them on a graph. The graph shows the mean agreement and has error bars that show 95% confidence intervals around the mean. The authors then perform a 2-way analysis of variance on the bot type and question. The results are as follows: There is a difference between bots The effect of the question is not significant. There is a significant interaction between bot type and question.

714744,$L^1$ convergence gives a pointwise convergent subsequence,"I have been reading Terry Tao's notes on Real Analysis and there's a part he just says, but does not really explain, so I am wondering if someone here would. The notes are http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/245a-notes-4-modes-of-convergence/ and my particular question is from Section 4, Corollary 3. It goes as follows, Let $f_n \rightarrow f$ in $L^1$ then there exists a sub sequence $(f_{n_j}) \subset (f_n)$ such that $f_{n_j} \rightarrow f$ pointwise a.e. Moreover $(f_{n_j})$ converges almost uniformly to $f$. The proof he gives is simply that since $\|f_n-f\|_1 \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ we can pick a sub sequence such that $\|f_{n_j}-f\|_1<2^{-j}$ which is enough to show pointwise a.e and almost uniform convergence. But what allows you to pick such a sub sequence is it maybe some Cauchy property or is it some weird construction? Then how do you go from that to pointwise a.e and even almost uniform convergence. I am assuming that for almost uniform, you do something similar to Egorov's theorem without the assumption the domain of $f$ has finite measure. Also I am aware that if you get almost uniform, you immediately have pointwise a.e, but I'd like to see how to get to both. Thank you.","['convergence-divergence', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

I would like to see the sheafification of this presheaf. I have a solution from my tutorial but I don't understand all the steps: $\mathfrak{B}^g(U):= \{(f_x)\in\prod\limits_{x\in U}\mathfrak{B}_x| \forall x\in U, \exists W\subset U, x\in W, g\in \mathfrak{B}(W) \textrm{ s.t. }\forall w\in W: g_W = f_W\}$. $\mathfrak{B}_x = \{f_x:U_x\to\mathbb{R}|U_x\textrm{ ''small enough'' s.t. } f_x\textrm{ continuous and bounded}\}$. But if $U_x$ is for example the preimage of $B_\epsilon(f(x))$ of $f:U\to \mathbb{R}$ then $f_x$ is bounded and hence $\mathfrak{B}_x=\{f_x:U_x\to\mathbb{R}| f_x \textrm{ continuous}\}$. (I don't understand what he wanted to tell with this part, and also I am not sure if I wrote $B$ correctly or if it should be $\mathfrak{B}$. We defined $B_\epsilon(0)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}: |x|<\epsilon\}$ in the proof for showing that $\mathfrak{B}$ is not a sheaf.) Now choose $W=U_x$ for a $x\in U$. So $g=f_x$ and hence $g_w=f_w$ $\forall w\in W\Rightarrow \mathfrak{B}^g(U)=\{f:U\to\mathbb{R}| f \textrm{ continuous}\}$. I would be really happy if someone could help me understand this example.

714830,Computing the Todd class of projective space.,"As an exercise I'm trying to verify that for $X=\Bbb{P}_k^n$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field, we have
$$\operatorname{td}(X)=\left(\frac{\epsilon}{1-e^{-\epsilon}}\right)^{n+1},$$
where $\epsilon\in A(X)$ is the class of a hyperplane in the Chow ring of $X$. By definition we have $\operatorname{td}(X):=\operatorname{td}(\mathcal{T}_X)$, where $\mathcal{T}_X$ is the tangent sheaf on $X$, and in turn for any vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ we have by definition
$$\operatorname{td}(\mathcal{E}):=\prod_{i=1}^r\frac{\alpha_i}{1-e^{-\alpha_i}},$$
where $r=\operatorname{rk}(\mathcal{E})$ and the $\alpha_i$ are such that $c_t(\mathcal{E})=\prod_{i=1}^r(1+\alpha_it)$. I've managed to show that $\operatorname{rk}(\mathcal{T}_X)=n$ and $c_t(\mathcal{T}_X)=\prod_{i=1}^{n+1}(1+\epsilon t)$.
Tempting as it may be to say that $\alpha_i=\epsilon$ for all $i$ and be done, unfortunately the indices don't match up as $n\neq n+1$. I haven't been able to fix this problem: I have shown that $\epsilon^{n+1}=0$ and so we may write
$$c_t(\mathcal{T}_X)=\prod_{i=1}^{n+1}(1+\epsilon t)=\sum_{i=0}^{n+1}\binom{n+1}{i}\epsilon^it^i=\sum_{i=0}^n\binom{n+1}{i}\epsilon^it^i,$$
from which it follows that $\prod_{i=1}^n\alpha_i=\binom{n+1}{n}\epsilon^n=(n+1)\epsilon^n$, and hence
$$\operatorname{td}(\mathcal{T}_X)=\prod_{i=1}^r\frac{\alpha_i}{1-e^{-\alpha_i}}=\prod_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\cdot\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{1-e^{-\alpha_i}}=(n+1)\epsilon^n\cdot\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{1-e^{-\alpha_i}}.$$
At this point I'm stuck; clearly $\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{1-e^{-\alpha_i}}$ is a symmetric polynomial in the $\alpha_i$ and hence a polynomial in the coefficients of $c_t(\mathcal{T}_X)$, i.e. in the terms $\binom{n+1}{i}\epsilon^i$ for $i\in\{0,\ldots,n\}$.

714888,Where is this formula for generating pythagorean triples coming from?,"I'm reading Stillwell's Mathematics and Its History .

I've made the following trial: By looking $(2)$, I've written the formula for the pythagorean theorem and I've switched only the $c$: $$a^2+b^2=\color{red}{(m^2 + n^2)^2}$$ And expanded it: $$a^2+b^2=\color{red}{m^4+2n^2m^2+n^4}\tag{3}$$ Then my guess is that I should find arbitrary $a$, $b$ (and perhaps some integers?) written in terms of $n$ and $m$ such that $(3)$ is true. So I guess I need to split the polynomial in (perhaps) some arbitrary way such as: $$a^2+b^2=\color{red}{m^4+2n^2m^2}\color{green}{+n^4}$$
$$a^2+b^2=\color{red}{m^4+n^2m^2}\color{green}{+n^2m^2+n^4}$$ And then find $a,b$ such that: $$\begin{eqnarray*}

Measure zero? -If it have derivative everywhere (but not necessary continuous derivative) what can we say about its set of stationary point?

715085,Solution for line intersection without special cases,"Say that we have two lines in two dimensions along the points $\vec{m} + s\vec{k}$ and $\vec{n} + t\vec{j}$ and we want to find the $s$ and $t$ for where these lines intersect. The obvious solution would be to solve the equations for the vector components: $$\begin{cases}
m_x + sk_x = n_x + tj_x \\
m_y + sk_y = n_y + tj_y \\
\end{cases}$$ However, in order to solve these, we have to divide by either $k_x$, $j_x$, $k_y$ or $j_y$ at some point, which introduces a special case for where this is zero. Clearly, however, the basic geometry of the problem only introduces the intrinsic special case where the lines are parallel; I don't think I should have to care about the lines being parallel to some arbitrary coordinate axes. In particular, in order to solve these in computer code, I'd like to avoid introducing any unnecessary special cases which make the code ugly. How to solve this problem without introducing any such arbitrary special cases? I have one solution, in which I multiply the vectors defining the lines by a matrix which transforms $\vec{m}$ to $(0, 0)$ and $\vec{m} + \vec{k}$ to $(1, 0)$ (or, well, actually the homogenous variants of them with a $1$-element added to each, used as I am to OpenGL), as such: $$ A = \begin{bmatrix}
lk_x & lk_y & -l(m_xk_x + m_yk_y) \\
-lk_y & lk_x & l(m_xk_y - m_yk_x) \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} $$
where
$$ l = \frac{1}{|k|^2} $$ When I transform $\vec{n}$ and $\vec{j}$ with the same matrix and then solve the component-wise equations, I only get the special case where $(Aj)_y = 0$, which, of course, corresponds to the intrinsic special case of the lines being parallel. This is nice and works and all, but I feel it is both a bit inelegant, and also suboptimal performance-wise when it comes to being implemented on a computer. What I really want to ask, then, is whether there's a simpler solution to this problem than mine.","['geometry', 'systems-of-equations']"

that each is either black or white. Ascertain their colours without taking
them out of the bag. Carroll's solution: One is black, and the other is white. Lewis Carroll's explanation: We know that, if a bag contained $3$ counters, two being black and one white, the chance of drawing a black one would be $\frac{2}{3}$ ; and that any other state of things would not give this chance. Now the chances, that the given bag contains $(\alpha)\;BB$ , $(\beta)\;BW$ , $(\gamma)\;WW$ , are respectively $\frac{1}{4}$ , $\frac{1}{2}$ , $\frac{1}{4}$ . Add a black counter. Then, the chances that it contains $(\alpha)\;BBB$ , $(\beta)\;BBW$ , $(\gamma)\;BWW$ , are, as before, $\frac{1}{4}$ , $\frac{1}{2}$ , $\frac{1}{4}$ . Hence the chances of now drawing a black one, $$= \frac{1}{4} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}.$$ Hence the bag now contains $BBW$ (since any other state of things would not give this chance). Hence, before the black counter was added, it contained BW, i.e. one black counter and one white. Q.E.F. Can you explain this explanation? I don't completely understand the explanation to begin with. It seems like there are elements of inverse reasoning, everything he says is correct but he is basically assuming what he intends to prove. He is assuming one white, one black, then adding one black yields the $\frac{2}{3}$ . From there he goes back to state the premise as proof.

715237,"Notation and hierarchy of cartesian spaces, euclidean spaces, riemannian spaces and manifolds","I am confused by some definitions. Forgive the looseness of my language. A Cartesian space is basically a space of points that can be represented by n-tuples ( and other things, but I won't go into specifics). Open sets are denoted by $|x^i_{0}-x^i|<{\epsilon}$. It is denoted by $R^n$ (according to Dubrovin's book). Euclidean spaces are Cartesian spaces where there exists co-ordinate systems in which the metric can be represented by the Kronecker delta. Its open sets can be represented as open balls with the usual definition of 'balls'. Riemannian spaces are Cartesian spaces which have a positive definite quadratic form on its tangent vectors. Euclidean spaces are special cases of Riemannian spaces. So I imagine that open sets are determined by the riemannian metric? or are they determined by euclidean balls? Now manifolds are spaces, whose subsets can be identified with Euclidean spaces. But such charts can be equipped with additional Riemannian metric. So I am confused. Does that mean that the charts on manifolds have 2 'metrics', a fundamental one determined via the identification with a region of euclidean space and second additional riemannian metric? Also open sets on a manifold may be defined by identifying them with the open sets in Euclidean space. So then how does the additional riemannian metric help determine open sets on the manifold? I am totally confused about the hierarchy of these spaces, if Cartesian is on the top and Riemannian is below and Euclidean even lower than that, than why are manifolds defined first by identification with Euclidean spaces and then given additional structure of a Riemannian metric? Isn't this the inversion of the given hierarchy?

715337,Why is the polynomial $S(\vec{x})$ with coefficients obeying a constraint homogeneous?,"I have recently been working on a problem to prove that a particular polynomial is in fact homogeneous. Although I have found out that this is true, I am curious to see whether there might be a deeper meaning to this, perhaps in algebra theory. Therefore, I will pose the problem here: Let $\{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_N\}$ be a set of complex variables. We can write for a polynomial $S$ the following expansion
$$
S(\vec{x})=\sum_{\vec{m}_\in D^N}d_{m_1,m_2,\cdots,m_N}(\vec{p})\prod_{j=1}^Nx_j^{m_j},
$$
where $\vec{p}=(p_1,p_2,\cdots,p_N)^T$ is complex and the hypercube $D^N$ is defined as
$$
D^N=\{0,1,\cdots,N-1\}^N.
$$
The allowed powers of each variable are thus $0,1,\cdots,N-1$. Now we impose the condition that $(x_i \partial_i -x_j \partial_j +i/2\kappa(p_i-p_j))S(\vec{x})$ should be divisible by $(x_i-x_j)$ for every $i,j$ satisfying $i\neq j$. By trying to divide out this term we get the following condition on the coefficients: for each $\beta,\rho\in \{1,2,\cdots,N\}$ where $\beta \neq \rho$, 
$$
\sum_{l\in \mathbb{Z}}^*d_{m_1,\cdots,m_{\beta+l},\cdots,m_{\rho-l},\cdots,m_N}(\vec{p})\left(m_\beta-m_\rho +\frac{i}{2\kappa}(p_\beta-p_\rho) \right)=0,
$$
where the star $*$ in the summation indicates that the summation runs over all $l\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $0\leq m_\beta+l \leq N-1$ and $0\leq m_\rho-l \leq N-1$. Using this relation, prove that the polynomial $S$ is homogeneous of degree $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$. This is equivalent to proving that if $\sum_{i=1}^Nm_i\neq \frac{N(N-1)}{2}$, then $d_{m_1,m_2,\cdots,m_N}(\vec{p})=0$. My own approach consisted in formulating an algorithm which rewrites the coefficient under consideration as a linear combination of coefficients which we are $0$. Consequently, I only showed that this algorithm terminated in a finite number of steps. However, for me this algorithm has no deep interpretation, while it would be very nice to understand the reason for this homogeneity. I would therefore very much like to know other approaches.","['complex-analysis', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

$\int_{-\infty}^0 + \int_0^{i m} + \int^0_{i m}+\int^{\infty}_0+\int_{C_R} = 2 \pi i \text{Res}_\infty$, where the two integrals on the imaginary axis don't cancel cause they are on the right and left part of the branch cut. 
The integral on $C_R$ goes to 0 when R goes to infinity. Assuming this setup is correct, I have the problem that computing the integral on the imaginary axis is still something I cannot do. The square root has a sign of difference on the two sides, but this doesn't give me anything simple I can solve.

My problem now is when you aren't integrating over a flat region of space but a curved surface $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$. Now I can't visualize this as a volume below the graph $f$ as there is another restraint. However someone explained surface integrals in this way to me. Imagine I am calculating the mass of a sheet of metal represented as a surface $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$, with a function $f(x,y,z)$ defining its density at any point. In this case the mass will be obtained by integrating the density-function over the surface. i.e I am still finding the surface area of the surface but multiplying that area by its value of $f(x,y,z)$ at every point. So if I want to find the surface area itself, I use $f(x,y,z)=1$. This would be consistent with my description of volume in the standard flat space integral as I'm simply multiplying the area $(U)$ by the height at that individual point $(f(x,y))$. Now I'm wondering whether for the curved space model whether the volume is actually the space between the two graphs if plotted on the same axis. So my question is this. Do my ideas make any sense?

So, after reducing the system, the solution space can be described by a linear function $f \, : \, \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^4$, which I can find explicitly. Because of the nature of the problem, I am interested only in nonnegative values for each of the 8 unknowns. So, I can restrict the function $f$ to the domain $\mathbb{R}^4_{\geq 0}$ (i.e. examine only nonnegative values for each of the 4 free variables). What I'm interested in knowing (and classifying for different parameter values, which will change $b$) is whether solutions exist for which all 8 unknowns are nonnegative--or equivalently, whether the function $f$ takes nonnegative values in the nonnegative domain $\mathbb{R}^4_{\geq 0}$.

Then I check the limit of the numerator,say $- \frac{a}{2}<x<0$. For t in the interval(x,0), there's  $\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+t}}<M$, where $M>0$,so $$| \int^x_0 \frac{t^2dt}{ \sqrt{a+t}} | <M |\int^x_0t^2dt| =M \frac{-x^3}{3},$$ by using the sandwich theorem I get $\lim_{x \to 0^-} \int^x_0 \frac{t^2dt}{ \sqrt{a+t}} =0$,thing should be the same when $x>0$ .

And seemingly it's possible to transform the content in a way that always maps the originally touched locations to the current finger positions and scales, translates, rotates the rest accordingly.","['geometry', 'affine-geometry', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'transformation']"

However I am interested in how to find this answer. Is there any way other that guessing? If not, what would probably be the least extra information you would need? P.S. This looks like a potentially VERY useful identity. Is it well known and used?","['trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus', 'functional-equations']"

716163,What is the most general formalism for machine learning?,"Most of the literature I can find in the field of machine learning is extremely practical, listing many techniques you can use like neural networks, SVMs, random forests, and so on. There are lots of suggestions on implementations and what approaches are good for different problems. My question is, is there a single unifying formalism or theoretical framework in which one can think about problems of inferring patterns and conclusions from data? In such a framework I'd be interested in exploring these kinds of questions: What is the correct number of free parameters to use for a given data set? How do we know when we've over-fit? How do we express the trade-off between the accuracy of low-resolution fitting and the precision of high-resolution fitting? Can we define a machine learning techniques in general terms (instead of specific ones like neurons or forests or deep learning or graphical models or...)? How can we objectively compare these techniques? Are any of them actually identical? What kinds of signals are possible to extract from data? What kinds of noise could prevent successful learning?","['probability-theory', 'bayesian', 'statistical-inference', 'machine-learning']"
716182,Consecutive quadratic residues,"I was studying quadratic reciprocity laws and came across the following question: Is it true that for every $k \in \mathbb{N} $ there exists a prime $p$ such that $1,2,...,k$ are all quadratic residues mod p? I think this might be true by recurrent use of Dirichlet Theorem, but I'm not quite sure that this idea works every time. For example: For $k=3$, we need $2$ and $3$ to be quadratic residues, which is accomplished by choosing a prime $p$ that is $ \equiv 1 \mod{8}$ and $ \equiv 1 \mod{3}$ (for example), i.e., a prime of the form $24k+1$, which there are infinitely many by the Dirichlet Theorem. I think we can continue this idea and guarantee that the first primes we want are quadratic residues and, thus, as the product of quadratic residues is also a quadratic residue, the first $k$ naturals. The problem is that we have to connect the law of quadratic reciprocity with some congruence conditions and make sure that we can iterate the process without reaching any contradiction (for example, a prime simultaneously $\equiv 1 \mod{8}$ and $\equiv 3 \mod{4}$). Does anybody see why or why not does this idea work? Thank you!","['quadratic-reciprocity', 'elementary-number-theory', 'number-theory']"
716233,Generalization of Hahn-Banach Theorem,"Let $Y$ be a subspace of a locally convex topological vector space $X$. Suppose $T:Y\longrightarrow l^\infty$ is a continuous linear operator. Prove that $T$ can be extended to a continuous linear operator $\tilde T:X\longrightarrow l^\infty$ such that $\tilde T|_Y=T$. We can extend each coordinate linear functional to a continuous linear functional on $X$. But I do not know how to prove the series is still in $l^\infty$. Note that the question gives locally convex topological vector spaces but not normed space. Hence I am not able to extend the coordinate functionals preserving their norms, which are not well-defined. How to prove?

716297,Why are roots of unity so important?,Can someone give a somewhat elementary explanation as to why roots of unity is so important? (I only know up to elementary number theory/group theory.) Also: Do similar roots of unity type structures exist for other closed curves such as an ellipse? I was thinking what'd happen to algebraic description of the roots of unity if you deform the circle into some other shape. It seems like linear relations of roots of unity are well studied. What's the motivation for studying that? What about non-linear relations? Are there any open problems regarding roots of unity?,['number-theory']

716318,Integrating $ \int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{d\theta}{3 + \sin\theta + \cos\theta}$,"I want to do the following integral in my complex analysis class: $$ \int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{d\theta}{3 + \sin\theta + \cos\theta}$$ I don't have the solution (in the textbook) but I checked via WolframAlpha, and they have a solution of $\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt 7}$ but I seem to be getting $\frac{2 \pi (1+i)}{\sqrt 7}$. I won't lay out everything I am doing since that would take me a long time, but basically I set $z = e^{i\theta}$, do all the substitutions, and at some point get:
$$ \int_{|z| = 1} \frac{2 \, dz}{6zi + z^2 - 1 + iz^2 + i}$$
I solve for the roots of the denominator, get:
$$z_1 = \frac{(1+i)(-3 + \sqrt 7)}{2}, z_2 = \frac{(1+i)(-3 - \sqrt 7)}{2}$$ I realize that $z_1$ falls in the circle I am integrating over, while $z_2$ extends pass the same circle. Then I have the following:
$$\int_{|z| = 1}\frac{2 \, dz}{(z-z_1)(z-z_2)}$$
I use Cauchy's formula to integrate and get the solution:
$$\frac{4 \pi i}{z_1 - z_2}$$
Then doing the algebra I get the answer I said in the beginning, I am thinking I am doing something wrong with my algebra or maybe there is something more systematically wrong with my method, anyway I want to know how to do this question.

716324,Series Expansion Of An Integral.,"I want to find the first 6 terms for the series expansion of this integral: $$\int x^x~dx$$ My idea was to let: $$x^x=e^{x\ln x}$$ From that we have: $$\int e^{x\ln x}~dx$$ The series expansion of $e^x$ is: $$\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n!}$$ Then we have: $$\int e^{x\ln x}~dx=\int\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(x\ln x)^n}{n!}dx$$ I integrated the first 3 terms (since it was the easiest the work with):
$$x+\frac{1}{4}x^2(2\ln x-1)+\frac{1}{54}x^3(9(\ln x)^2-6\ln x+2)+\cdots$$ Is there any other efficient way of getting the first 6 terms of the series expansion of the integral?","['sequences-and-series', 'integration', 'indefinite-integrals']"
