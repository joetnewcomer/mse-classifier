1498877,Piecewise function within a proof. Verification.,"Prove or give a counterexample. 
If $f$ is decreasing on $(-\infty,0)$ and if $f$ is decreasing on $[0, \infty)$, then $f$ is decreasing on all real numbers. I have chosen to give a counterexample. 
I was wondering if I could use a piecewise function to do this.
What if I set $y=-x$ for the interval $(-\infty,0)$ and $y=1-x$ for the interval $[0,\infty)$? Since, there is a jump at $0$, can I say that the $f$ ""increased"" at $0$, and thus is not decreasing over all real numbers, or am I unable to do this? If so, why?

The bound on $f^\prime(x)$ may mean that $f(x)$ may not change too much but does it mean that $f$ is constant? I thought for a while and found that $f^\prime(0)=0$ and by using mean value theorem, if $x\neq0$ then there's a real number $y$ between $0$ and $x$ such that $\left|f(x)\right|=\left|xf^\prime(y)\right|\leq\left|xf(y)\right|$.

1498907,Does the tensor product with a finite dimensional vector space gives you some kind of semi-basis?,"Let $V$ be a (possibly infinite dimensional) vector space, and $W$ a finite dimensional one. Then, one can define the tensor product $V\otimes W$ as the free vector space on $V\times W$ modulo some relations. Now, if $V$ is finite dimensional, and if $\{e_1,\ldots,e_m\}$ is a basis for $V$ and $\{e'_1,\ldots,e'_n\}$ for $W$, we get a basis
$$\{e_i\otimes e'_j:1\le i\le m,q\le j\le n\}$$

  $$u=v_1\otimes e'_1+\cdots+v_n\otimes e'_n$$

I can easily show that the elements $v_i\in V$ exist, but I am not sure why they would be unique. Existence: An element $u\in V\times W$ is the projection of a formal sum of finitely many $(v_i,w_i)\in V\times W$, i.e. $u=v_1\otimes w_1+\cdots v_n\otimes w_n$.

1498974,How to write mathematical induction?,"Reading the literature about mathematical induction, I have learnt that there are between 4 and 3 steps in reasoning and writing the proof. I say between 3 and 4 because actually I see that texts and authors of proofs diverge slightly in their explanation and in the style in which the proof is written. This is my impression, at least. (1) In general, we all agree that the first component is the statement we want to prove and we write it. (2) Then, it follows the base case, when we check the formula for n=1, and we see if the statement holds. So far, there is no difference between proof writers. (3) Afterwards, it follows the assumption, when we write k = n and we state that k is a generic number which appartains to N. Can be whatever natural number. (4) Finally, there is the inductive step, when we write n = k+1, and we proceed with the algebraic manipulation. I see that some authors concentrate the steps (3) and (4) in an unique step and actually I like it more, as I don't see the need to write one passage exactly the same as the previous one, but with k in place of n! I am asking for your advice as I would like to set once for all my style in writing this kind of proof, grouping steps (3) and (4) in a unique one. However, since that I like to introduce verbally the steps, I am thinking about the right way to introduce the assumption/inductive step . Is it correct the following form, in your opinion? Assume that there exists a general number k+1, with k=n, such that... etc... I am indeed not sure about how to write this sentence, this is why I ask here. Please, let me know if, where and why I am wrong and also you can point me out if the words I choose are the proper ones - for instance, about ""general number"".

1499020,Details about Brownian motion,"Unfortunately I could not make it to the last probability theory lecture and now I am reading through the notes and have some troubles understanding what is going on. So we defined Brownian motion as a stochastic process on $[0,\infty)$
such that 1.) $t \mapsto X_t(\omega)$ is a.s. continuous
2.) $X_t$ has stationary $X_{t_i}-X_{t_{i-1}} \sim N(0,t_i-t_{i-1})$ and independent increments where $X_t \sim N(0,t).$ Now, we are following the book ""Continuous Time Markov Processes"" and I refer to the beginning of Chapter 1.7. It says: It is most convenient in the case of Brownian motion to take the probability space $\Omega$ to be the space $C[0,\infty)$ of all continuous functions $\omega(.)$ on $[0,\infty).$ This choice is natural because Brownian paths are continuous. The process is defined by $X(t,\omega) = \omega(t).$ The $\sigma$- algebra $F$ is taken to be the smallest one for which the projection $\omega \mapsto \omega(t)$ is measurable for each $t$. Rather than having one probability measue on $(\Omega,F)$ we now have  a family $(P^x)$ of probability measures indexed by $x \in \mathbb{R}$. The probability measure is the distribution of $x+B(.),$ where $B$ is standard Brownian motion. This is all a little bit confusing to me. So far I regarded Brownian motion as a map $X: \Omega \rightarrow \big(C[0,\infty), B(C[0,\infty))\big)$ where $B$ is the Borel sigma algebra on $C[0,\infty)$ and $\Omega$ was a space that I did not really care about. But now they seem to be changing $\Omega$ which is fairly bizarre to me. Does anybody understand what they want to do and from where to where (in particular equipped with which sigma algebra and measures) they want the brownian motion to go? As it could still be that they want to denote something different with omega, I wanted to ask the experts here.","['probability-theory', 'brownian-motion', 'probability', 'stochastic-processes']"

I want to show that $d_1$ is a metric equivalent with $d$ , a given metric. Here is my attempt so far: Given a set $U\subseteq X$ which is open in the $d$ metric and $x\in U$ , there exists an $\varepsilon>0$ such that $B_{d}(x,\varepsilon)\subseteq U$ . We want to show that there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $B_{d_1}(x,\delta)\subseteq U$ , and one way to do that is to show that there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $B_{d_1}(x,\delta)\subseteq B_{d}(x,\varepsilon).$ Given any $y\in B_{d}(x,\varepsilon)$ , we have $d(x,y)<\varepsilon$ . Since $d_1(x,y)\leq d(x,y)$ , we know $d_1(x,y)< \varepsilon$ , so that $y\in B_{d_1}(x,\varepsilon)$ . Therefore $B_{d}(x,\varepsilon)\subseteq B_{d_1}(x,\varepsilon)$ .

For the first case, I see a Student's t -test for one sample which looks related: could I verify that the sample is different from 1 pound with that test, then actually compute the sample mean and compare to 1 pound to check if I'm below or above. For the second case, could I do a one-way anova ? I would double the weight of each sampled apple and use these new values as a sample to compare vs the sampled oranges. Again, I would use the test to verify that they were different, then actually compute the respective sample means and compare to see if I'm below or above.

1499235,"Geometric justification for the prime spectrum and ""generic points""","I realize there have been plently of discussions about this, but most of them are over my head and I never understand the geometric intuition behind them. I'm trying to make a big list of ""justifications"" for using the prime spectrum of a ring. So far, I have two fairly pleasing formal ones: Preimages of prime ideals are prime ideal, so we have functoriality. The prime spectrum is the ""free local ring"" on a ring in the following sense: in passing from $\mathsf{Set}$ to the sheaf topos, we find that in terms of the internal language of sheaves over the prime spectrum, all rings are local. These are formally satisfying but I don't have any feel for them. For instance, it makes sense that maximal ideals don't pull back to maximal ideals because points needn't pull back to points, however why should I expect irreducible varieties to pull back to irreducible varieties? I don't know topos theory so I don't know how or why $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ falls out of the sky. Now I'm looking for geometric justifications to look at the space whose points are prime ideals. The people I asked have all mentioned generic points ; something along the lines of: ""Instead of looking at particular points of a variety, we should really be studying a 'generic point' of each irreducible component, which only has the properties shared by all of its points."" I don't understand how prime ideals magically produce this vague notion... The ideal-variety correspondence simply says they corrspond to irreducible subvarieties, nothing more. So, in painstaking detail, what are generic points and why is the prime spectrum the space we should be looking at?","['algebraic-geometry', 'big-picture', 'intuition', 'commutative-algebra']"

1499262,How to deal with misapplying mathematical rules? [closed],"Closed . This question is opinion-based . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post . Closed 8 years ago . Improve this question I have noticed that though I understand the mathematical material in my classes nigh perfectly, I still make frequent careless mistakes. Roughly 55% (95% CI: (37, 72) of these errors are due to me misapplying mathematical rules. For example, I may in a derivation go from $a = 4(c + b)$ to $a = 4c + b$, even though I am aware that $q(r + v) \neq qr + v$ in general. How can I make this misapplication of rules less devastating on tests? I am slow at math, and my tests are fast-paced, so I usually barely have enough time to finish tests when dong several steps at once and not checking my work. This prevents me from using many techniques. It has been suggested to solve problems multiple times in the same way, which I rarely have time to do. It has also been suggested to not do multiple steps in a single line, but again, I seldom have time to do this, and even when I do do it, it only slightly decreases the number of errors I make. The scientific papers I've seen don't help much. I currently keep a journal of errors, but I have found few patterns in them, so I have a hard time determining what errors to check for. It has been suggested to continue practicing, as this will make me eventually improve. However, despite practicing roughly forty hours per week, I have not noticed an improvement other than ones that resulting from me improving my techniques. One way I have succeeded in improving my techniques is by first checking to see if the solution seems correct, for example by seeing if it seems reasonable or plugging the answer to an algebra problem into the original equation. Then, if the answer is incorrect, I go back to the first line in the derivation, cover up the next, determine what the next line should be, look to see if that is what was written, and then repeat this for all lines. The problem with this is that it if time-consuming, which prevents me from finishing the test, and it only prevents roughly half of errors. So, how can I deal with misapplying mathematical rules?","['calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'linear-algebra', 'soft-question']"

1499338,"Is pullback of a quasi-coherent sheaf, quasi-coherent?","I'm very new to this whole sheaf business and very confused, so forgive me if the question is dumb (or not, I have no idea really). Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a quasi-coherent sheaf on $Y$. For simplicity say $Y$ is an affine variety. Suppose we have a map $f:X\to Y$ (suppose $X$ is also an affine variety), I'm wondering if the inverse image (pullback) sheaf $f^{-1}\mathscr{F}$ is quasi-coherent? And if so what is the relation between their corresponding modules? Let me tell you about my own attempt: I know that any quasi-coherent sheaf is isomorphic to $\tilde{M}=M\otimes_{k[Y]}\mathscr{O}_Y$ where $M$ is a $k[Y]$-module. The map $f$ also induces a map $f^*: k[Y]\to k[X]$, meaning $k[X]$ is a $k[Y]$-algebra. By extension of scalars we find a $k[X]$-$k[Y]$ bimodule $M\otimes_{k[Y]}k[X]$. Then
$$\tilde{M} = M\otimes_{k[Y]}\mathscr{O}_Y =(M\otimes_{k[Y]}k[X])\otimes_{k[X]}\mathscr{O}_Y$$
The only thing stopping the above sheaf to be sheaf on $X$ is $\mathscr{O}_Y$ not being $\mathscr{O}_X$. So I thought maybe we have (very naively)
$$
f^{-1}\tilde{M} = (M\otimes_{k[Y]}k[X])\otimes_{k[X]}\mathscr{O}_X
$$
I searched a little bit and seems like this is actually true. So I thought of proving it. It is enough we show it for a basis of topology of $X$, say $D(g)=\{x\in X|g(x)\neq 0\}$ for $g\in k[X]$. Then by definition
$$
\Gamma(D(g), f^{-1}\tilde{M})=\varinjlim_{V\supset f(D(g))} \Gamma(V, \tilde{M})=M\otimes_{k[Y]}
\varinjlim_{V\supset f(D(g))} \Gamma(V, \mathscr{O}_Y)
$$
which is $(M\otimes_{k[Y]}k[X])\otimes_{k[X]} \Gamma(D(g), f^{-1}\mathscr{O}_Y)$. This means $$f^{-1}\tilde{M} = (M\otimes_{k[Y]}k[X])\otimes_{k[X]} f^{-1}\mathscr{O}_Y$$
But do we have $f^{-1}\mathscr{O}_Y=\mathscr{O}_X$? I don't so (I mean for any $f$ this is true? really?)! But if it is, how do we prove it? Also in the above argument is there any flaws?","['algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory']"

1499597,Norm on reduced crossed product - $C^*$ version v.s. $L^p$ version,"Let $(G,A,\alpha)$ be a $C^*$-dynamical system where $G$ is a countable discrete group. When defining the reduced crossed product, one can proceed as follows: Let $\pi$ be a faithful representation of $A$ on a Hilbert space $H$. Then we get a representation $\tilde{\pi}$ of $A$ on $\ell^2(G,H)$ such that $(\tilde{\pi}(a)\xi)(t)=\pi(\alpha_{t^{-1}}(a))\xi(t)$ for all $a\in A$, $t\in G$, and $\xi\in\ell^2(G,H)$. Let $\lambda$ be the representation of $G$ on $\ell^2(G,H)$ such that $\lambda_s\xi(t)=\xi(s^{-1}t)$ for $s,t\in G$ and $\xi\in\ell^2(G,H)$. Then $(\tilde{\pi},\lambda)$ is a covariant representation,  called a regular covariant representation, and its integrated form $\tilde{\pi}\rtimes\lambda$ is a faithful representation of $AG$ on $\ell^2(G,H)$. Define the reduced norm on $AG$ by $||f||_r=||(\tilde{\pi}\rtimes\lambda)(f)||$. The completion is the reduced crossed product. It can be shown that $||f||_r=\sup ||\sigma(f)||$ for $f\in AG$, where the supremum is taken over all regular covariant representations $\sigma$ obtained from (not necessarily faithful) representations of $A$. Therefore, one could have used either one of these as the definition of $||f||_r$. My question has to do with the $L^p$ analog of the reduced $C^*$-crossed product, which has been studied by Chris Phillips. In this case, $A$ is isometrically isomorphic to a norm-closed subalgebra of $B(L^p(X,\mu))$ for some measure space $(X,\mu)$ and $p\in[1,\infty)$. In Phillips's setup, he uses the supremum definition (following earlier work by Dirksen-de Jeu-Wortel) but the supremum is now taken over all regular covariant representations obtained from nondegenerate $\sigma$-finite contractive representations of $A$, and this gives a seminorm, so one mods out by the kernel of this seminorm and takes completion in the induced norm to get the reduced $L^p$ crossed product. I have also seen a talk by Kasparov where he uses the first definition of the reduced norm. I suppose he is thinking of $A$ as already coming with a faithful representation given by the isometric embedding. So my question is: Are the two norms the same? Or what can we say about the resulting algebras?","['c-star-algebras', 'operator-algebras', 'banach-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"
1499621,Reference request: are levelsets/levelspaces (as defined here) used anywhere in mathematics?,"Thinking about unimodal distributions in multiple dimensions, I came up with the following. Given a function $f : Y \leftarrow X$ where $X$ is a topological space, define that a levelset of $f$ is a subset $A$ of $X$ such that there exists $y \in Y$ such that $A$ is a connected component of $f^{-1}(y)$. Note that this differs somewhat from what appears to be the usual definition. By the levelspace , let us mean the collection of all level sets. Write $\mathrm{lev}_f$ for the levelspace of $f$. So $\mathrm{lev}_f$ is a partitioning of $X$. We get a (set-theoretic) factorization of $f$ as the composite of two functions, $$f_1 : Y \leftarrow \mathrm{lev}_f, \mbox{ and } f_0 : \mathrm{lev}_f \leftarrow X.$$ Anyway, returning to the opening sentence, I had this idea that maybe we should define: Definition. Given a function $f : Y \leftarrow X$ where $X$ is a topological space, $f$ is unimodal iff $\mathrm{lev}_f$ is
  homeomorphic to a connected subset of $\mathbb{R}.$ This assumes that we've chosen a topology on $\mathrm{lev}_f,$ of course; the most sensible choice seems to be that it is the final topology induced by $f_0$. Anyway, I have a bunch of questions about all this. Questions. Q0. Are levelsets/levelspaces (as defined above) used anywhere in e.g. optimization theory, probability theory, or ""hard"" analysis? If so, what is the accepted terminology regarding these things, and where can I learn more? Q1. Under reasonable hypotheses, does the above definition of ""unimodal"" agree with what appears to be the standard definition ? I quote from the wikipedia page: ""A more general definition, applicable to a function $f(X)$ of a vector variable $X$ is that $f$ is unimodal if there is a one to one differentiable mapping $X = G(Z)$ such that $f(G(Z))$ is convex. Usually one would want $G(Z)$ to be continuously differentiable with nonsingular Jacobian matrix."" Q2. Assuming $Y$ carries topological structure and $f : Y \leftarrow X$ is continuous, does it follow that $f_1$ is continuous? I included ""algebraic geometry"" in the tags in the hope that someone in that community might know more about this, despite that these questions obviously doesn't fit that tag directly. Also, the main thing I wanted to ask is Q0. The other two questions should be treated as bonus questions, therefore posts that attempt to answer (with at least moderate levels of success) either/both of Q1/Q2 will be awarded a small bounty.","['real-analysis', 'algebraic-geometry', 'general-topology', 'optimization', 'reference-request']"

1499911,How to estimate solutions to an ODE with an asymptotically nilpotent coefficient?,"Suppose $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R^n$ satisfies
$$
f'(t)
=
A(t)f(t),
$$
where $A$ is a smooth matrix-valued function.
If I know that the matrix $A(t)$ is asymptotically nilpotent, how could I prove a sub-exponential estimate for the solution $f$? To be more explicit, suppose $A(t)^2\to0$ but $A(t)\not\to0$ as $t\to\infty$.
Then one would expect slower than exponential (perhaps even linear) growth for $f$; if $A$ and $A^{-1}$ had roughly constant norm, then one would expect exponential growth.
My main interest is in the case when $A(t)^2\to0$, but also $A(t)^k\to0$ for $k>2$ is interesting. If I apply Grönwall's inequality to the function $t\mapsto|f(t)|^2$ and observe that
$$
\frac{d}{dt}|f(t)|^2
=
2\langle f(t),A(t)f(t)\rangle
\leq
2\|A(t)\|\cdot|f(t)|^2,
$$
I get the exponential estimate
$$
|f(t)|
\leq
|f(0)|\exp\left(\int_0^t\|A(s)\|ds\right)
$$
for $t>0$.
This estimate is much worse than I would expect in an asymptotically nilpotent case, but I don't know how to get a polynomial (or other sub-exponential) estimate. Example: $n=2$ and $A(t)=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\(1+t^2)^{-2}&0\end{pmatrix}$.
Now $A(t)^2=(1+t^2)^{-2}I$ which goes to zero as $t\to\infty$.
The solution to our ODE with $f(0)=(a,b)$ is
$$
f(t)
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\sqrt{1+t^2}(a+b\arctan(t))
\\
\frac1{\sqrt{1+t^2}}(at+b+bt\arctan(t))
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
The solution grows essentially linearly: $|f(t)|\leq C|f(0)|(1+t)$ for any $t>0$ and some constant $C$.
On the other hand, if I use Grönwall's inequality, I have the estimate
$$
2\langle f(t),A(t)f(t)\rangle
=
2f_1(t)f_2(t)[1+(1+t^2)^{-2}]
\leq
|f(t)|^2[1+(1+t^2)^{-2}],
$$
which cannot be significantly improved.
Plugging this into Grönwall's inequality gives an exponential growth estimate for $f$, which much weaker than the linear estimate from the explicit solution.
[The example ends here.] I could promote the ODE to a second order one: $f''(t)=[A(t)^2+A'(t)]f(t)$.
Now the coefficient $A(t)^2$ is asymptotically small, but $A'(t)$ need not be.
And even if it were, I don't know how to use Grönwall for a second order ODE.
If $A$ was constant, I could use nilpotency to get $f(t)=e^{At}f(0)=(I+At)f(0)$.
There is a series expansion also for time-dependent $A$ (the Dyson series ), but I couldn't see how to turn that into a rigorous estimate.
I do not assume that $A(t)$ is nilpotent for any $t$, just that some power tends to zero as $t\to\infty$. Question: Given some assumptions on the decay rate of $A(t)^2$ (or $A(t)^k$ for some $k>2$), what tools could I use to prove a growth estimate for norm of the solution $f(t)$?
I am looking for an estimate that I could play with to see how different decay rates for $A^2$ give different growth rates for $f$. Edit: If we denote $B(t)=A(t)+\phi(t)I$ for some scalar function $\phi$ and $g(t)=\exp\left(\int_0^t\phi(s)ds\right)f(t)$, then $g'(t)=B(t)g(t)$.
One could try to get estimates for $g$ and convert them to estimates for $f$, but it seems to me that this method cannot add much.
(The exponentials of integrals coming from this change of functions and Grönwall's estimate cancel each other.)

1500223,Conformal immersions from surfaces into 3-manifolds,"Let $f:(S,g) \to (M,h) $ be a smooth immersion of a compact surface into a 3 - manifold. Is it true that there exists a diffeomorphism $\phi: S \to S$, such that the metric $(f \circ \phi)^*(h)$ is conformal to $g$ ? To explain the motivation behind ths question, consider first the following set-up. Let $D_2 \subset \mathbb R^2$ be the standard 2-disk and $f: (S,g_{eukl}) \to (M,g)$ an immersion into a Riemannian manifold. It is well-known that the area of $f$ is defined as $A(f) = \int_{D_2} \sqrt{||f_1||_g \cdot ||f_2||_g - g(f_1,f_2)^2 } dx_1dx_2$, where $f_i := \partial f/\partial x_i$. On the other hand, the Dirichlet energy is defined as $E(f) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{D_2} ||f_1||_g + ||f_2||_g dx_1dx_2$, and by simply comparing the integrants, one sees that $A(f) \leq E(f)$ with equality holding if and only if $||f_1||_g = ||f_2||_g$ and $g(f_1,f_2) = 0$ everywhere. Immersions with that property are called conformal and it is well known that for any given immersion, there exists a parameter transformation $\psi:D_2 \to D_2$ such that $f \circ \psi$ is a conformal immersion. In other words, an immersion $f$ is conformal if and only if $f^*(g) = e^{\phi} \cdot g_{eukl}$ for some smooth function $\phi$ on $D_2$, which means precisely that $f^*(g)$ and $g_{eukl}$ are conformal as metrics on $D_2$. I have some trouble understanding why this is still possible when $f:(S,h) \to (M,g)$ is an immersion of any compact Riemannian 2-manifold. I know that the area of $f$ is in general defined by $A(g) := \int_S \omega_{f^*(g)}$, whereas the Dirichlet energy depends on $h$ and is defined by $E_h(f) := \frac{1}{2} \int_S |df|^2 \omega_h$. I have shown that we always have $A(f) \leq E_h(f)$ (regardless of $h$), where $f$ is said to be conformal if equality holds. One can show that this is equivalent to the metrics $f^*(g)$ and $h$ being conformal, i.e $f^*(g) = e^\phi \cdot h$. Is it still true that there exists a diffeomorphism $\psi: S \to S$ such that $f \circ \psi$ is conformal ? I ask because I only find papers that assert the existence of isothermal coordinates on any Riemannian 2-manifold, which essentially seems to only imply the case from the first paragraph.","['differential-geometry', 'minimal-surfaces', 'riemannian-geometry', 'surfaces']"

Proof :Let ${E_1,...,E_n}$ be an orthonormal basis at $p\in M$. Let $(x^i)$ be a coordinate system where $E_i\mid_p=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$. By shrinking the coordinates neighborhood. We may assume that the image of the coordinates chart is a cube $C_\epsilon=\{x:|x^i|<\epsilon,i=1,...,n\}$. Begin by parallel translating on the $x^1$-axis. Then proceed to parallel translate along the $x^2$-axis. Continuing this process we get n vector fields on $C_\epsilon$. Now we want to show that the frame is parallel. We want to show that $$\nabla_{\partial_1}E_j=...=\nabla_{\partial_k}E_j\equiv 0$$
on $M_k=\{x^{k+1}=...=x^n=0\}$.By induction assume that it holds for some $k$. On $M_{k+1}$, $\nabla_{\partial_{k+1}}E_j=0$ by construction, and for $i\leq k$, $\nabla_{\partial_i}E_j=0$ on the hyperplane where $x^{k+1}=0$ by the inductive hypothesis. So it suffices to show that $\nabla_{\partial_{k+1}}(\nabla_{\partial_i}E_j)\equiv 0$.

There exists a bijective correspondence $f$ of the set $A$ with the set $\{1, \ldots, n+1\}$ if and only if there exists a bijective correspondence $g$ of the set $A - \{a_0\}$ with the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$.

$$0\to L\to V\to L'\to0$$
I would like to understand why these $V$'s are parametrized by $H^1(X, (L')^\ast\otimes L)$. Up to tensoring with $(L')^\ast$  the short exact sequence above, we can equivalently ask why, for fixed $L$, holomorphic vector bundles $V$ of rank 2 sitting in exact sequences of the form
$$0\to L\to V\to \mathcal{O}_X\to0$$
are parametrized by $H^1(X,L)$. I was thinking about reasoning with Cech cohomology. With respect to some covering $U_i$ of $X$, the transition functions of $V$ can be written in a upper-triangular matrix with the transition functions $\ell_{ij}$ of $L$ and $1$ on the diagonal and some $g_{ij}\in\mathcal{O}(U_i\cap U_j)$ at the top right entry. Thus, all the information should be encoded in the $g_{ij}$. The transition relations for the bundle then yield the following relations $g_{ii}=0$ (on each $U_i$) $g_{ij}=-\ell_{ij}g_{ji}$ (on each $U_i\cap U_j$) $g_{ij}=\ell_{ik}g_{kj}+g_{ik}$ (on each $U_i\cap U_j\cap U_k$) However, when interpreting $g=(g_{ij})$ as an element of the group $C^1(\mathcal{L})$ in the Cech complex, by using the above relations I get
$$(dg)_{ijk}:=g_{jk}-g_{ik}+g_{ij}=g_{jk}(1-\ell_{ij})$$

I can of course solve this for simple cases and make some general observations, e.g.: Trivially $E(1)=1$, for any $n$. For $k=2$, fix one shooter, and the probability that the other
randomly-chosen one is his 'partner' is $\frac{1}{2n-1}$, in which
case one target is hit; otherwise, two targets are hit. From these
probabilities the expectation easily follows. If $k>n$ then at least one target has both its shooters firing at it.
Remove it and consider the problem with $n-1$ targets. Do this
recursively until $k\leq n$. So the only uniquely interesting cases

1500766,The degree of a principal divisor,"I've become extremely confused (due to having no experience with varieties) over a remark (Remark 3.7) Silverman makes in his book The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves . Here's the relevant background: If $\phi: C_1 \rightarrow C_2$ is a nonconstant morphism of smooth curves over $K$ then the pullback map $\phi^* : K(C_2)\rightarrow K(C_1)$ extends to a homomorphism on divisors $\phi^*:\text{Div}(C_2)\rightarrow\text{Div}(C_1)$ given by $\phi^* (Q) = \sum_{P\in \phi^{-1}(Q)} e_\phi (P) (P)$ and extended $\mathbb Z$-linearly to all divisors. There is also the notion of a pushforward homomorphism of divisors $\phi_*: \text{Div}(C_1)\rightarrow\text{Div}(C_2)$ given by $\phi_* (P) = (\phi(P))$, similarly extended by linearity. These morphisms satisfy some nice properties; I think the relevant ones are $\deg (\phi^* D) = \deg \phi \deg D$ for all divisors $D\in \text{Div}(C_2)$ $\phi^* \text{div}(f) = \text{div}(\phi^* f)$ for all $f\in K(C_2)$ $\deg \phi_* D = \deg D$ for all $D\in \text{Div}(C_1)$ Silverman then claims that because these properties imply that $\phi_*, \phi^*$ send divisors of degree zero to divisors of degree zero they extend to homomorphisms on the Picard groups - $\phi_* :\text{Pic}(C_1)\rightarrow \text{Pic}(C_2)$ and $\phi^* : \text{Pic}(C_2)\rightarrow \text{Pic}(C_1)$. Now he considers the case where we have a morphism $f: C\rightarrow \mathbb P^1$, which we can also think of as an element of $K(C)$. He claims that $\deg \text{div}(f) = \deg f^* ((0)-(\infty)) = \deg f - \deg f = 0$ I understand why $\deg f^* ((0)-(\infty)) = 0$, as I believe it follows from these Picard homomorphisms, but I'm struggling to ""see"" the first equality; why should $\deg \text{div}(f) = \deg f^* ((0)-(\infty))$? Working everything through, if I haven't made a mistake we get $\deg \text{div} (f) = \sum_{f(P)=0} \text{ord}_P (f) - \sum_{f(P) = \infty}\text{ord}_P (f)$; $\deg f^* ((0)-(\infty)) = \sum_{f(P)=0} e_f (P) - \sum_{f(P) = \infty}e_f(P)$ It then seems reasonable that to prove these two things are equal we should prove that for a zero (respectively a pole) $P\in C$ of $f$ we should have $\text{ord}_P (f) = e_f (P)$. Let $t_0\in K(\mathbb P^1)$ be a uniformiser for $f(P) = 0$; then $e_f (P) = \text{ord}_P (f^* t) = \text{ord}_P (t\circ f)$. So I want to be able to prove that $\text{ord}_P (f) = \text{ord}_P(t\circ f)$ for any uniformiser $t$ of $f(P)$ (the little intuition I have in this area tells me this ought to be true). But I'm really struggling to prove this formally using the maximal ideals of the local rings $K[C]_P$ and $K[\mathbb P^1]_{f(P)}$. Is this true, and can you provide a proof? I suppose the question can be phrased more generally as follows: given morphisms of smooth curves $C\xrightarrow{f}\mathbb P^1 \xrightarrow{g} \mathbb P^1$, it makes sense to consider $f\in K(C), g\in K(\mathbb P^1)$. Then it would be nice if the valuation behaved multiplicatively on composition i.e. $\text{ord}_P (g\circ f) = \text{ord}_P (f) \text{ord}_{f(P)} (g)$. Again I believe this intuitively but have no real idea how to phrase the proof. Edit: I am also aware that $\text{ord}_P (\phi^* g) = e_g (P)\text{ord}_{\phi(P)} (g)$ in the general case above (where $g\in K(C_2)$ and $P\in C_1$). However, in the case $C_2 = \mathbb P^1$, $\phi = f$ and $g = t$ is a uniformiser, this gives no new information.","['elliptic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"

1500829,A disease spreading through a triangular population,"I have run into this problem in my research, which I'm presenting under a different guise to avoid going into unnecessary background. Consider a population that is connected in a triangular manner, as shown in the figure below. The root node has a disease, which spreads downwards through the population as follows: With probability $p$ a diseased parent node infects only one of its two child nodes (chosen randomly); and with probability $1-p$ it infects both of them A child node becomes diseased if it is infected by one or two parent nodes I am interested in the asymptotic behavior of the expected number of diseased nodes at level $k$. Simulations show that the expected number of diseased nodes grows asymptotically linearly with the number of levels. Moreover, the slope of this relationship decreases approximately linearly with $p$ (obviously, when $p = 0$ the slope is $1$, as everyone gets diseased; when $p = 1$ the slope is $0$ as the number of diseased nodes remains at $1$ at every level). So the behavior seems to follow: $E(\text{diseased nodes at level n})=(1 - p)n$, at least to a very good approximation.","['expectation', 'graph-theory', 'combinatorics', 'asymptotics', 'probability']"

Here is my proof. Let U be an union of open sets and suppose x belongs to U. Suppose there is largest open interval I that contains x. Then Consider U-I, if this is empty, then we are done. If U-I is not empty, pick any point y in U-I and let J be the largest open interval that contains y. In general, intersection of J and I must be empty, otherwise this would contradict our assumption.

Using the chain rule $$ \frac{d}{dt}f(p+t(x-p))=\sum_{i=1}^n(x^i-p^i)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} f(p+t(x-p)) .$$ However, it seems to me that if we define $z^i=p^i+t(x^i-p^i)$, what we should actually have $$ \frac{d}{dt}f(p+t(x-p))=\sum_{i=1}^n(x^i-p^i)\frac{\partial}{\partial z^i} f(p+t(x-p)) .$$ And since $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} z^i=t $, I don't understand how these two formulas can be the same. Once in a while I encounter things like this and it always baffles me. I have seem a similar question here but it is claimed that they are just using the variable $x$ for two different things. But why would you do this? It is so ambiguous,especially in this situation where it would mean using $x^i$ for two different things in the $same$ expression! And furthermore they were careful enough to write the argument of the function explicitly. So is it really the case that they are just using $x$ for different things?

1500964,Complex 'mean-value-theorem'-like property implies quadratic,"One of my friend asked me the following problem: Problem. Suppose that $f$ is a holomorphic function on a convex open set $U$ which satisfies the following property: For all distinct $z, w \in U$, there exists $\zeta$ on the line segment joining $z$ and $w$ such that
  $$ \frac{f(w) - f(z)}{w - z} = f'(\zeta). $$
  Then show that $f$ is a polynomial of degree at most 2. This problem was given in the lecture note right after some basic properties of complex differentiability are introduced. I was able to prove this problem, though my argument relies on heavy machinery (such as inverse function theorem) which is beyond the chapter containing it. Q. My question is, is there any elementary solution? For a reference, here is my heavy solution: Step 1. If $f'' \equiv 0$ on $U$, there is nothing to prove. So we may assume that $f''(z_0) \neq 0$ for some $z_0 \in U$. Our goal is to show that Claim. There exists a neighborhood $V \subseteq U$ of $z_0$ such that for any $z \in V$,
  $$ \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0} = f'(z_0 + \tfrac{1}{2}(z - z_0)).$$ Indeed, assuming that this claim is true, we obtain \begin{align*}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n+1)}(z_0)}{(n+1)!} (z - z_0)^n
&= \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0} \\
&= f'(z_0 + \tfrac{1}{2}(z - z_0))
= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n+1)}(z_0)}{n! 2^n} (z - z_0)^n.
\end{align*} Comparing coefficients of both sides, we have $$f^{(3)}(z_0) = f^{(4)}(z_0) = \cdots = 0$$ and hence $f$ is a polynomial of degree at most 2 on $V$. Then by the principle of analytic continuation, this continues to hold on all of $U$ as desired. Step 2. So it remains to prove the claim. To this end, notice that $g(z) := (f(z) - f(z_0))/(z - z_0)$ has removable singularity at $z = z_0$, hence extends to a holomorphic function on $U$. By the inverse function theorem, there exists a neighborhood $V \subseteq U$ of $z_0$ on which $f'$ is invertible. By shrinking $V$ further, we may assume that $V$ is convex. From the assumption, we know that $g(V) \subseteq f'(V)$. Thus $$ \zeta(z) := (f')^{-1}(g(z)) $$ is a well-defined holomorphic function on $V$ such that $$ \frac{\zeta(z) - z_0}{z - z_0} \in [0, 1] \quad \text{for all } z \in V \setminus\{z_0\}. $$ This implies that $(\zeta(z) - z_0)/(z - z_0)$ is constant, and this value can be determined by $$ \frac{\zeta(z) - z_0}{z - z_0}
= \lim_{w \to z_0} \frac{\zeta(w) - z_0}{w - z_0}
= \zeta'(z_0)
= \frac{g'(z_0)}{f''(z_0)}
= \frac{1}{2}. $$ This completes the proof. ////","['alternative-proof', 'complex-analysis']"
1500968,About a theorem in Beauville's book.,"Look at the following theorem (due to Castelnuovo) taken from Beauville's book on complex surfaces: I have a question about the behavior of $f$ on the exceptional curves generated by $\eta$. Suppose that $E$ is an exceptional curve coming from a blow up of $\eta$ at a point $p\in S$, then what is $f(E)$?
I think that $f(E)$ can't be a point, otherwise I could define $\phi(p):=f(E)$. This is a contradiction with the definition of rational map.
Hence I conclude that $f(E)$ is a curve on $X$. Is my reasoning correct? Edit: Maybe the above reasoning is wrong, but at least I'd like to know which are the exceptional curves (coming from blow-ups) that are not contracted by $f$ (if there is any). I'm sure that I've read somewhere the following thing: The exceptional curve of the last blow-up can't be contracted by
  $f$. Can you explain this sentence?","['algebraic-geometry', 'surfaces', 'birational-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"
1501005,$A_4$ is not simple,"I would appreciate if you could please express your opinion about my proof and maybe give me a hint where you deem suitable. To prove that $A_4$, an alternating group of even permutations of $S_4$, is not simple, we need to show that there exists a normal subgroup (call it $H$) of $A_4$, such that $H$ is not trivial and $H \neq A_4$. Now define a homomorphism $\pi: A_4 \to A_4/H$ by $\pi(\sigma)=\sigma H$ for any $\sigma \in A_4$. We need to show that there exists an element $\epsilon \neq \sigma \in A_4$ such that $\pi(\sigma)=H$. That is, we need to show that $\ker\pi$ is not trivial. Define $H=\ker(\pi):=(\epsilon, (12)(34), (23)(14), (13)(24))$ (where $\epsilon$ is the identity permutation). We then prove that $H$ is closed under subgroup criteria (omitted). Now we need to show that $\sigma H\sigma^{-1} \subset H$. To do this, we need to consider three cases. Case 1: trivial. Case 2: products of disjoint transpositions are in $H$ since $H$ is a subgroup of the said transpositions. Case 3: 3-cycles. This is where I'm a little lost. In order to prove that $\sigma_3 H\sigma^{-1}_3 \subset H$, we need to show that all 3-cycles in $A_4$ conjugating any element of $H$ (a product of disjoint transpositions) will be again a product of disjoint transpositions. Other then that, I think, we're done. I'm wondering if a simpler proof is possible.","['simple-groups', 'group-theory', 'proof-verification', 'normal-subgroups']"
