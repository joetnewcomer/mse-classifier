87373,Dividing a set into two subsets the optimal way (May be similar to the knapsack problem),"We have n stones having weight m[1]..m[n] , and two sacks. We put each stone into first or second sack; the resulting sacks weights with stones become S[1] and S[2] (the sacks themselves have no weight). The task is to divide stones so that the weight difference |S[1] - S[2]| is minimal Let me ask you if my approach is right: 1) let's sort the stones descending. 2) i=1 3) A is the index of the lightest sack (or first if they have equal weight) 4) put m[i] stone to S[A] , S[A] += m[i] 5) i++ 6) if there are stones left (i <= n) then goto 3","['optimization', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics']"

87380,Does anyone know l'Hôpital's rule for limits?,I was doing an assignment and the middle 2 questions are l'Hôpital's rule questions and we haven't even done this in class yet. These are 1 or 2 chapters away yet we are expected to do them and I have no idea how to do these because we haven't learned yet so I was hoping someone here can help me. First question: An incorrect use of l'Hôpital's rule is illustrated in the following limit computation. Explain what is wrong and find the correct value of the limit. $$\lim_{x\to\pi/2}   \frac{\sin(x)}{x}    = \lim_{x\to\pi/2}  \frac{\cos(x)}{1}=0$$ Second question is: Find $\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty} xe^x$ using l'Hôpital's rule. Using this information does the function $xe^x$ have a horizontal or vertical asymptote? state the equation of the asymptote.

87436,The Tuesday Birthday Problem - why does the probability change when the father specifies the birthday of a son? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Boy Born on a Tuesday - is it just a language trick? (12 answers) Closed 9 years ago . I've most recently read about the Tuesday Boy Problem via twitter and I, as probably most other people, was sure that the probability has to be 1/2. After having read through a lot of solutions which were not identical at all, I've come to the conclusion that $P = \frac{13}{27}$ sounds the most reasonable. The corresponding argument was as follows: Say the older child is the boy born on Tuesday. Then, if the younger child is female, there are seven possibilities and analogous if the younger child is male. In case the younger child is the boy born on Tuesday, for an older daughter, again there are seven possibilities, but for an older son, there are only six, because the case that the older son was born on Tuesday has already been counted. Thus, $$P = \frac{6+7}{6+7+7+7} = \frac{13}{27}. $$ My first question is: Is this the correct solution? I've found other websites giving different solutions, however I could never agree with any of those. In case this is the correct solution: Why does the probability change when the father specifies the birthday of a son? (does it actually change? A lot of answers/posts stated that the statement does matter) What I mean is: It is clear that (in case he has a son) his son is born on some day of the week. I could replace Tuesday with any day of the week and the probability would be the same. Say the father would have stated: I have two children. (At least) One of them is a son. Then, without loss of generality, we could say that this son is born on a Tuesday and again we would have $P = \frac{13}{27}$ . But looking at an equivalent (?) problem, we get a completely different probability: Let's toss two coins consecutively and say heads is equivalent to ""son"" and tails to ""daughter"". Then, if we know that we tossed at least one heads, if it was the first tossed coin, the probability for another heads is 1/2. If the second coin was heads, then we can only take the case in account where the first coin was tails. So the probability for two heads is $P = \frac{1}{3}$ . So my second (actually third) question is: Where did I go wrong? Lastly I want to ask (as my knowledge in probability/statistics is limited to what I have been taught in high school) whether the argument which gives $P=\frac{13}{27}$ for the original Tuesday Birthday Problem already takes the possibility of twins in consideration. Can it be regarded as a special case of two boys both born on Tuesday (I ask because in every argument leading to this probability there was a distinction between older child = boy vs. younger child = boy)? Thank you very much in advance for any answer.",['probability']
87443,Uniform distribution on $\mathbb Z$ or $\mathbb R$,"I was assisting once the course in Probability Theory where students learnt quite quickly that there are ways to assign the uniform distribution to any finite set - or even subsets of $\mathbb R$ of a finite measure. They also clearly understtod the proof that there are no ways to put a uniform distribution (as a probability measure) on $\mathbb Z$ or a uniform distribution in  a sense of a constant density on $\mathbb R$. But then I was asked the question: Why is it impossible? What is intuitive meaning of this? The only answer I could find that time refers to $\mathbb R$: well, the density is just a density w.r.t. Lebesgue measure - so why do we want the uniform distribution to have a constant density w.r.t. precisely Lebesgue measure? (as for me, if we omit the algebraic structure on $\mathbb R$, it would be just a measure). However, I couldn't answer the question why there is no a uniform distribution on $\mathbb Z$ where the sentence ""each value comes with equal probability"" does have sense, I hope. Now this question bothers me myself and any help is appreciated.","['probability-theory', 'soft-question']"
87452,Which chapters of Euclid's elements would be helpful for drawing a grid?,"I am drawing a $19 \times 19$ grid on my desk. For aesthetic purposes, I don't want to use a ruler. Rather, I want to use Euclidean theorems to 'prove' to myself that such and such line meets at a right angle. I have already marked out the four points that determine the edges of the roughly square rectangle that will contain the grid. I imagine there is some chapter of the elements that would contain a proof that two lines are perpendicular and at right angles to one another. I imagine myself being able to apply that theorem to each intersection on the grid, piecemeal, in order to 'grow' it, starting at an arbitrary edge, or perhaps starting at all four and working toward the center. Of course, this is all for fun, and because I love the thinking style of the Elements . But how would I use the book to do that.

87483,"Exercise 9.5.21 in Grillet (Jacobson radical, Nakayama's Lemma)","I've managed to prove the following exercise: (21.) Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of a commutative ring $R$ . Prove the following: if $A$ is a finitely generated $R$ -module, and $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ is a minimal generating subset of $A$ , then $x_1 + \mathfrak{m} A, \ldots, x_n + \mathfrak{m} A$ is a basis of $A/\mathfrak{m}A$ over $R / \mathfrak{m}$ . in Grillet's Abstract Algebra , page 377, only under the hypothesis that $\mathfrak{m}$ is the only maximal ideal, i.e., that $R$ is a local ring. Weak proof: Firstly, the scalar multiplication is defined as $(r\!+\!\mathfrak{m})(a\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A) \!:=\! ra\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A$ . To see this is well defined, notice that if $r\!+\!\mathfrak{m} \!=\! 0$ , i.e. $r\!\in\!\mathfrak{m}$ , then $ra\!\in\!\mathfrak{m}A$ , i.e. $ra\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A\!=\!0$ ; and also that if $a\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A\!=\!0$ , i.e. $a\!=\!ma'\!\in\!\mathfrak{m}A$ , then $ra\!=\!rma'\!\in\!\mathfrak{m}A$ , i.e. $ra\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A\!=\!0$ . Actually, the $R/\mathfrak{m}$ -module $A/\mathfrak{m}A$ is constructed by first creating the $R$ -module $A/\mathfrak{m}A$ (this is possible because $\mathfrak{m}A$ is a submodule of $A$ , since $\mathfrak{m}$ is an ideal of $R$ ) and then turning it into an $R/\mathfrak{m}$ -module (this is possible because $\mathrm{Ann}_R(A/\mathfrak{m}A)\supseteq\mathfrak{m}$ ). To prove $x_1\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A,\ldots,x_n\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A$ generate $A/\mathfrak{m}A$ , we must show that $(R/\mathfrak{m})(x_1\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A)\!+\!\ldots\!+\!(R/\mathfrak{m})(x_n\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A)\!=\!A/\mathfrak{m}A$ , which means $Rx_1\!+\!\ldots\!+\!Rx_n\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A\!=\!A/\mathfrak{m}A$ , or equivalently, $Rx_1\!+\!\ldots\!+\!Rx_n\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A\!=\!A$ , but this is true since $Rx_1\!+\!\ldots\!+\!Rx_n\!=\!A$ by hypothesis. Alternatively, we could argue that since $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ generate the $R$ -module $A$ , they generate the $R$ -module $A/\mathfrak{m}A$ , and therefore generate the $R/\mathfrak{m}$ -module $A/\mathfrak{m}A$ . If $x_1\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A,\ldots,x_n\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A$ were $R/\mathfrak{m}$ -linearly dependent, then WLOG $x_n\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A$ could be expressed as a $R/\mathfrak{m}$ -linear combination of the others, so already $x_1\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A,\ldots,x_{n-1}\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A$ would generate $A/\mathfrak{m}A$ , which would mean $Rx_1\!+\!\ldots\!+\!Rx_{n-1}\!+\!\mathfrak{m}A\!=\!A$ . But since $J(R)\!=\!\mathfrak{m}$ , by Nakayama's Lemma this would mean $Rx_1\!+\!\ldots\!+\!Rx_{n-1}\!=\!A$ , a contradiction with the hypothesis on minimality of $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ . $\blacksquare$ Question: how can I prove the general version of the exercise?

I'm trying to prove that $$\int \vert fg\vert =\Vert f \Vert_p\Vert g \Vert_q$$ if and only if $\vert f \vert^p$ is multiple of $\vert g \vert^q$ almost everywhere. To do this, I want to consider the following cases: if $\Vert f \Vert_p=0$ or $\Vert g \Vert_q=0$ , we are done. Then suppose that $\Vert f \Vert_p\ne 0$ and $\Vert g \Vert_q\ne 0$ . If $\Vert f \Vert_p=\infty$ or $\Vert g \Vert_q=\infty$ , we are done (I hope). If $0\lt\Vert f \Vert_p\lt\infty$ and $0\lt\Vert g \Vert_q\lt\infty$ , proceed as follows. When we are proving the Hölder's inequality, we use that for $a,b\geq 0$ $$ab\leq \frac{a^p}{p}+\frac{b^q}{q},$$ where the equality holds if and only if $b=a^{p/q}$ . Explicitly $$\int\vert fg \vert\leq \Vert f \Vert_p \Vert g \Vert_q \int\left( \frac{\vert f \vert^p}{p\Vert f \Vert_p^p} + \frac{\vert g \vert^q}{q\Vert g \Vert_q^q}\right)=\Vert f \Vert_p \Vert g \Vert_q.$$ From here, we see that the equality in Hölder's inequalty holds iff $$\frac{\vert fg \vert}{\Vert f \Vert_p \Vert g \Vert_q}=\frac{\vert f \vert^p}{p\Vert f \Vert_p^p} + \frac{\vert g \vert^q}{q\Vert g \Vert_q^q}, \text{ a.e.}$$ iff $$\frac{\vert g \vert}{\Vert g \Vert_q}=\left( \frac{\vert f \vert}{\Vert f \Vert_p} \right)^{p/q},\text{ a.e.}$$ iff $$\vert g \vert^q\cdot \Vert f \Vert_p^p=\vert f \vert^p \cdot \Vert g \Vert_q^q,\text{ a.e.}$$ Q.E.D. But, assuming that $\Vert f \Vert_p\ne 0$ and $\Vert g \Vert_q\ne 0$ , what about when $\Vert f \Vert_p=\infty$ or $\Vert g \Vert_q=\infty$ ? How can I deal with it? In the case of Minkowski inequality, suppose that the equality holds and that $g\not \equiv 0$ (and then $\left( \int \vert f+g \vert^p\right)\ne 0$ ). I need to prove that $\Vert f \Vert_p$ is multiple of $\Vert g \Vert_q$ almost everywhere. I can reduce to the ""Hölder's equality case"". I can get $$\vert f \vert^p=\left( \int \vert f+g \vert^p\right)^{-1}\Vert f \Vert_p^p\vert f+g \vert^p$$ $$\vert g \vert^p=\left( \int \vert f+g \vert^p\right)^{-1}\Vert g \Vert_p^p\vert f+g \vert^p$$ almost everywhere, but again, using the finiteness and nonzeroness of $\Vert f \Vert_p$ and $\Vert g \Vert_p$ .","['holder-inequality', 'inequality', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'lp-spaces']"
87655,Regarding Ladder Operators and Quantum Harmonic Oscillators,"When dealing with the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Operator $H=-\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}+x^{2}$, there is the approach of using the Ladder Operator: Suppose that are two operators $L^{+}$ and $L^{-}$ and define $f_{n}$ such that $$L^{+}(f_{n})=\sqrt{n+1}f_{n+1}$$ $$L^{-}(f_{n})=\sqrt{n}f_{n-1}$$ then $$L^{+}L^{-}(f_{n})=L^{+}(\sqrt{n}f_{n-1})=nf_{n}$$ $$L^{-}L^{+}(f_{n})=L^{-}(\sqrt{n+1}f_{n+1})=(n+1)f_{n}$$ Thus $$L^{+}L^{-}+L^{-}L^{+}=(2n+1)f_{n}$$ Now since $$H=-\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}+x^{2}=\left(x+\frac{d}{dx}\right)\left(x-\frac{d}{dx}\right)$$ $$=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(x+\frac{d}{dx}\right)\left(x-\frac{d}{dx}\right)+\left(x+\frac{d}{dx}\right)\left(x-\frac{d}{dx}\right)\right]$$ $$=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x+\frac{d}{dx}\right)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x-\frac{d}{dx}\right)+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x-\frac{d}{dx}\right)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x+\frac{d}{dx}\right)$$ If we let $$L^{+}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x+\frac{d}{dx}\right)\quad\text{and}\quad L^{-}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(x-\frac{d}{dx}\right)$$ then $$H=L^{+}L^{-}+L^{-}L^{+}$$ Since $$L^{+}(f_{n})=\sqrt{n+1}f_{n+1}\implies$$ $$f_{n}=\sqrt{n!}L^{n}(f_{0})$$ Thus if we can a $f_{0}$ such that $$f_{n}=\sqrt{n!}L^{n}(f_{0})\implies L^{-}(f_{n})=\sqrt{n}f_{n-1}\tag{1}$$ would be satisfied, then we have found a set of eigenfunctions for H, which is $f_{n}$ and the corresponding eigenvalue is 2n+1. Now my instructor says that if we let $f_{0}$ be in the kernel of $L^-$, meaning that: $$L^{-1}f_{0}=0\tag{2},$$ then (1) would be true. Specifically, this means that $$f_{0}(x)=e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^{2}}.$$ As it is already verified (and commonly used in quantum mechanics) that this $f_{0}(x)$ does satisfy (1). But I can't really see how does (2) leads to (1). Is this choice $f_0$ really a lucky guess or actually a choice the generally works for all operators that can be expressed as $H=L^{+}L^{-}+L^{-}L^{+}$? A different way of asking this question is: are the ladder operator really just operators that tells us how to get from one state to another, or it is actually something that would be used as a general method of solving some differential equations?","['operator-algebras', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'quantum-mechanics']"

87824,Modification of Mazur's lemma,"Working through Brézis and solving an exercise I have a question about my solution. It's well known that, if $x_n$ converges weakly to $ x $ in a Banach space $X$, then there exists a sequence $\{y_l\}$ of convex combinations of the $x_n$ converging strong to $ x $. (Banach space is not needed) Now in Brézis, as an exercise, I should show: 1). if $ x_n \rightharpoondown x $  weakly then it exists a sequence $ y_l $ such that 
  $ y_l \in \operatorname{conv}\left(\bigcup_{i=l}^\infty \{x_i\}\right) \forall l $ s.t. $ y_l \to x $ 2.) if $ x_n \rightharpoondown x $  weakly then it exists a sequence $ y_l $ s.t
  $ y_l \in \operatorname{conv}(\bigcup_{i=1}^l \{x_i\}) \forall l $ s.t. $ y_l \to x $
  where $\operatorname{conv}$ is the convex hull. My proof of 1) is like this: I will use that every convex set is closed if and only if it's weakly closed.
so proof of 1): $ x \in cl(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\ge 1})) $ therefore I can pick a $ y_1 $ s.t. 
$ y_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{m_1} \lambda_i x_i $ which is in $\operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n \ge 1})$ and $\| y_1 - x\| < \frac{1}{2}$. Then we know, that $ x \in cl(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\ge m_1}))$, clearly  choose $ y_2 $ s.t. 
$$ y_2= \sum_{i=m_1+1}^{m_2} \lambda_i x_i  \mbox{ such that }  \|y_2-x\| < \frac{1}{4}.$$ Just as a note, $ y_2 \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\ge m_1}) $ 
Suppose we have chosen our sequence up to an index $ k $. We know: $ x \in \operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\ge m_k})) $ again choose $ y_{k+1} $ s.t : $$y_{k+1}= \sum_{i=m_k+1}^{m_{k+1}} \lambda_i x_i\mbox{ such that }  \|y_{k+1}-x\| < \frac{1}{2^{k+1}}.$$ and this should prove 1), if I'm not wrong.
As a question at the point where I have chosen the $y_{k+1}$: the $x_i$ in the sum are not the same as for the sequence. To be precise, the $ x_i $ in the sum is not the $ i$-th element of the sequence, right? If not, why can I choose it in such a way? Looking at 2) it's clear, that $ y_1 = x_1 $. If it exists an index $ N_0 $ s.t. $ x \in \operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\le N_0})) $, then I have no troubles since I can choose a $ y_k $ as ""near"" to $ x $ as I want. Therefore I get strong convergence. 
So should I just choose the $ y_1, \dots y_{{N_0}-1} $ as an arbitrary convex combination, and start choosing $y_{N_0}$ in a way, such that the sequence converges (Since the finitely many elements at the beginning are not important for convergence). However I'm not sure any more about the existence of such an index $ N_0 $. Edit: I have a new idea about 2). define $ \alpha_k:= inf \|x-y_k\| $ over all $ y_k \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\le k}) $. 
Obviously $ \alpha_k \ge \alpha_{k+1}$. Claim: $ \alpha_k \to 0 $. proof: let $ \epsilon > 0 $, it exists a $ z_\epsilon \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\ge_1})$,hence $ z_\epsilon = \sum_{i=1}^{m(\epsilon)} \lambda_ix_i $, s.t $ \|x-z_\epsilon \| \le \epsilon $ Therefore we could find a $ N \in \mathbb{N} $ s.t. $ x_1, \dots, x_{m(\epsilon)} \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\le N}) $ so we conclude, $ \alpha_{N+1} \le \epsilon $. Is there another way to solve this?

My idea is to to assume that $d>n$ and arrive at a contradiction (since if $d=n$, then we are done).

87851,Combining two probability distributions,"I have a variable $X$. In a measurement $A$, $X$ follows the normal distribution $N_1$ with mean $m_1$ and standard deviation $\sigma_1$. In a similar measurement $B$, $X$ follows another normal distribution $N_2$ with mean $m_2$ and standard deviation $\sigma_2$. 
In this case, what will be the combined or joint probability distribution of $X$? Will it be $N_1+N_2$  or $N_1 N_2$ ? (Addition) Let's assume $A$ and $B$ are independent measurements. We can think about a situation when a measurer $A$ comes and measure the distribution of $X$ and then next a person $B$ comes and measures the distribution again. Both measurers measure independently. 
The question is what will be the true probability distribution of $X$ in this case? We assume that the measurement of $A$ and $B$ are equally reliable. (Paraphrasing a comment from r.e.s.)

87903,How do I prove a scheme is connected?,"Here is the question:
Suppose $X$ is a $k$-scheme, $k=\bar{k}$, if $X$ is connected, then for any algebraically closed field $K$  containing $k$, $X_K=X\times_k\operatorname{Spec}K$ is connected. I know there is a proof in  the book of the stacks project( here ), it firstly proves that if $Y$ is geometrically connected over $k$, then the projection from $X\times_k Y$ to $X$ induces a bijection between the connected components of $X\times_kY$ and the connected components of $X$. Secondly, it is easy to show that if $k$ is algebraically closed and $K$ contains $k$, then $\operatorname{Spec}K$ is geometrically connected. Thus applying the above results we can prove the question. Since the proof of first statement uses the Chevalley's theorem in the non-Noetherian version to show the projection $X\times_kY$ to $X$ is open, I donot like it . I want to know a direct proof. I want to know if there exists an affine criterion or something like that to show a scheme is connected ? Or are we able to reduce for the Noetherian case ? Edit : As Matt E pointed out, we only need to prove that $\Gamma(X_K,\mathcal{O}_{X_K})$ has no nontrivial idempotents. Lemma Suppose $k$ is algebraically closed, and $K$ contains $k$, $A$ is a $k$ algebra, then the idempotents of $A\otimes_kK$ come from $A$. Proof we can assume that $A$ is reduced. Then we have an embedding $A\hookrightarrow \prod A/\mathfrak{p}_i$, tensoring $K$, $A\otimes K\hookrightarrow (\prod A/\mathfrak{p}_i)\otimes K\hookrightarrow \prod A/\mathfrak{p}_i\otimes K$. And since $k$ is algebraically closed, $A/\mathfrak{p}_i\otimes_k K$ is domain, we know the forms of idempotents in the 3th ring. QED. Now, we will show $\Gamma(X_K,\mathcal{O}_{X_K})$ has no nontrivial idempotents. We pick an affine open cover and intersection of any two affine opens can be covered by an affine cover. Suppose $e$ is an idempotent in the global section, say those affine open we considered are $\operatorname{Spec} A_i\otimes_kK$, then $e$ restricts at every affine open is idempotent and comes from $\operatorname{Spec} A_i$, say $e_i $, thus equals $e_i\otimes_k 1$. All $e_i$ are compatible in $\operatorname{Spec}A_i$, thus we have an unique section $f\in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ which also is idempotent such that $f$ restricts in $\operatorname{Spec}A_i$ is $e_i$. Hence $f=0$ or $f=1$ ($X$ is connected), all $e_i=1$ or all $e_i=0$, so $e=1$ or $e=0$. We are done. Remark. In general, $\Gamma(X_K,\mathcal{O}_{X_K})\neq\Gamma(X，\mathcal{O}_X)\otimes_kK$.

87914,Linear MMSE estimate of MMSE estimator,"This question is prompted by a recent discussion ( Conditional Expectation a Decreasing Function Implies Covariance is nonpositive ) about the relationship between conditional expectation and covariance. Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are zero-mean unit-variance random variables with covariance (and correlation coefficient) $\rho$ .  The
minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) estimator of $Y$ given $X$ is 
the random variable $g(X)$ that minimizes $E[(Y-g(X))^2]$ , and as is
well known, $$g(X) = E[Y \mid X] ~\text{minimizes}~E[(Y-g(X))^2]$$ It is also well known that $E[g(X)] = E[E[Y\mid X]] = E[Y] = 0$ .  In general, $g(X)$ is a nonlinear function.
On the other hand, if the estimator is restricted to being 
of the form $\hat{Y} = aX + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, 
then the linear MMSE estimator of $Y$ given $X$ is $\hat{Y} = \rho X$ , that is, $$a = \rho, ~ b = 0, ~\text{minimizes}~E[(Y-aX-b)^2].$$ The linear MMSE estimator $\rho X$ has a mean-square-error $E[(Y-\rho X)^2] = 1 - \rho^2$ and so the mean-square-error 
of the MMSE estimator $g(X)$ can be no larger: $$E[(Y-g(X))^2] \leq 1 - \rho^2.$$ A simplified version of the question in the previous discussion is: 
if $g(\cdot)$ is a decreasing
function of its argument, show that $\rho$ is nonpositive. My question is: what is the linear MMSE estimate of $g(X) = E[Y \mid X]$ given $X$ ?  That is, what choice of real numbers $c$ and $d$ minimizes $E[(g(X) - cX - d)^2]$ ?  Since $g(X)$ and $X$ both have zero mean and $X$ has unit variance, standard linear MMSE estimator theory gives that $d = 0$ and $$c = \frac{\text{cov}(g(X),X)}{\text{var}(X)} = \text{cov}(g(X),X) = E[Xg(X)]$$ which I think might work out to be $\rho$ , but I am not sure about this.
Any suggestions on how to proceed further would be appreciated.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'mean-square-error']"

Prove that $AB=0$. I've done the following: denote $(\lambda_i),(\mu_i),(\eta_i)$ the eigenvalues of $A,B,A+B$, respectively. They are real since $A,B$ are symmetric. Moreover, since $A,B$ are diagonalizable, if all $\lambda_i$ or all $\mu_j$ are zero, then $A$ or $B$ is zero and $AB=0$. suppose there exist some non-zero eigenvalues; then the identity given translates in  $$ \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i^k +\sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i^k=\sum_{i=1}^n \eta_i^k \qquad \forall k >0 $$

Since the question was not asked in calculus or any kind of analytical course, I'm pretty sure that they don't expect a constructive proof.

The main problem is that the set of all such functions which are not Lipschitz on a specific $[s,t]$ is not a closed set.

88089,Conditions for $A$ that ensure the boundedness of the solutions of $x'=Ax$,"I have to find conditions under which the solutions of $x'=Ax$ are bounded for $t\rightarrow \infty$ and $t\rightarrow \pm \infty$. We proved in our course that $\lim_{t \rightarrow \ \infty}  x(t)=0$ and $\lim_{t \rightarrow - \infty}  |x(t)|=\infty$, if all the eigenvalues of $A$ have negative real part (and for the last limit $x$ is not the zero solution); if $A$ has an eigenvalue greater that zero, then $\lim_{t \rightarrow  \infty}  |x(t)|=\infty$. So I think that the conditions are: $x$ is bounded for $t\rightarrow \infty$ , if the real part of all  the eigenvalues are negative (trivial, since it follows from my course) and bounded for $t\rightarrow \pm \infty$ if the real parts of all the eigenvalues vanishes. Do you think this is sufficient - or that my professor could want some other additional (finer) conditions ? Side question: Since we didn't specify what $|x(t)|$ means, I took it means the norm of $x(t)$ and not the vector of the absolute values of the components of $x(t)$, because in the latter case $\lim_{t \rightarrow  \infty}  |x(t)|=\infty$ doesn't makes sense to me, because only a sequence of numbers can have the limit $\infty$. Am I right that it means the norm ?",['ordinary-differential-equations']
88106,Minimal generation for finite abelian groups,"Let $G$ be a finite abelian group. I know of two ways of writing it as a direct sum of cyclic groups: 1) With orders $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$ in such a way that $d_i|d_{i+1}$, 2) With orders that are powers of not necessarily distinct primes $p_1^{\alpha_1}, \ldots, p_n^{\alpha_n}$. Let $S$ be the collection of all possible minimal generating sets. Minimal here means that removing an element of $s \in S$ makes it into a non generating set for $G$. The isomorphisms of 1) and 2) provide two elements $s_1, s_2 \in S$. a) Is it true that the cardinality of $s_1$ is the minimum among the cardinalities of all $s \in S$? b) The second description provides us with lots of elements of $S$. Indeed, by using the chinese reminder theorem, summing two generators for $\mathbb{Z}_{p_i^{\alpha_i}}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p_j^{\alpha_j}}$ if $p_i \neq p_j$, we get a generator for $\mathbb{Z}_{p_i^{\alpha_i} p_j^{\alpha_j}}$. Is it true that all elements in $S$ can be obtained in this way? (I hope it is clear what I mean with b)","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abelian-groups', 'extremal-combinatorics']"
88107,"What are some ""natural"" interpolations of the sequence $\small 0,1,1+2a,1+2a+3a^2,1+2a+3a^2+4a^3,\ldots $?","(This is a spin-off of a recent question here ) In fiddling with the answer to that question I came to the set of sequences $\qquad \small \begin{array} {llll}

\ldots \\
 \end{array} $ with some indeterminate a . We had the discussion often here in MSE, that interpolation to fractional indexes, say A(1.5)=?? is arbitrary, considering, that an initial solution composed with any 1 -periodic function satisfies the condition. But here the embedding in a set of sequences, which are constructed from binomial-coefficients might suggest some ""natural"" interpolation, such as for $\qquad \small K(1)=1, K(2)=1+a, K(3)=1+a+a^2, \ldots $ the interpolation $\small K(r) = {a^r-1 \over a-1}$ seems the most ""natural"" which even can smoothly be defined for a=1 . This observation made me to refer to ""q-analogues"" $\small [r]_a $ in my answer in the initiating MSE-question, but it's not obvious how to interpolate the shown sequences of higher orders A , B , C (I think they're not related to the ""q-binomial-analogues"" , for instance ). Q: So what would be some ""natural"" interpolation to fractional indexes for the sequences A , B , C , and possibly in general for sequences generated in the obvious generalized manner? Agreeing mostly with Henning's ansatz I got now the general form as $$ A_m(n) = {1 \over (1-a)^m} - \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \binom{n+m}{k}{a^{n+m-k} \over (1-a)^{m-k} } $$
I do not yet see, whether some examples of fractional indexes agree with the solutions of all three given answers so far, for instance: given a=2.0 what is A(1.5) , B(4/3) , C(7/5) ? With my programmed version I get now 
$\qquad \small  A(1.5)\sim 9.48528137424  $ $\qquad \small  B(4/3) \sim 11.8791929545  $ $\qquad \small  C(7/5) \sim 18.4386165488  $ (No interpolation for fractional m yet) [update 2] the derivative-versions of Sivaram and Michael arrive at the same values so I think, all versions can be translated into each other and mutually support each other to express a ""natural"" interpolation.

$$ (f|g) = \int_0^1 f(t)g(t) dt. $$
If $t$ is a real number, find the polynomial $g_t$ in $V$ such that $(f|g_t) = f(t)$ for all $f$ in $V$. My Attempt: The way I thought to do it was, 
let $f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3$ and $g_t(x) = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + b_3x^3$.
$$(f|g_t) = \sum_{j, k} \frac{1}{1 + j + k} a_j b_k $$ Since $(f|g_t) = f(t)$, I get $$t^j = \sum_k \frac{1}{1 + j + k}b_k.$$ Let $A$ be the matrix $A_{kj} = \frac{1}{1 + j + k}$, so
$$ (b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3)A = (1, t, t^2, t^3) $$ Thus
$$(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3) = (1, t, t^2, t^3)A^{-1}.$$ I can compute $A^{-1}$ and that would give me the answer, I think, but it seems like a lot of work, and I would not be using any of the information from the chapter to solve it. I am assuming there is a lot easier way to do this. The chapter is called ""Linear Functionals and Adjoints"" from Linear Algebra by Hoffman and Kunze. EDIT : I think the way the chapter wanted me to do this was the following. Find an orthonormal basis using Gram Schmidt, say $f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4$. Then let $L_t(f) = f(t)$. We can then let $$g_t = L_t(f_1)f_1 + L_t(f_2)f_2 + L_t(f_3)f_3 + L_t(f_4)f_4.$$ Then say $f = a_1f_1 + a_2f_2 + a_3f_3 + a_4f_4$. $$
\begin{align*}
(f| g_t) &= a_1L_t(f_1)(f_1| f_1) + a_2L_t(f_2)(f_2| f_2) + a_3L_t(f_3)(f_3| f_3) + a_4L_t(f_4)(f_4| f_4) \\
&= L_t(a_1f_1 + a_2f_2 + a_3f_3 + a_4f_4) = L_t(f) = f(t).
\end{align*}$$ The computation is still more than I want to do, but the ideas are all there. I guess this was more focused on the linear functional part of the chapter, instead of the adjoint part.",['linear-algebra']

88143,Generating Functions: how do I get my answers in terms of differential operators?,"I'm reading and enjoying ""generatingfunctionology"". What a great fun book! But, I'm having some difficulty with the exercises. For example, take the series $a_n = n^2$ I'd like to find the Generating function, $S(x)=\sum\limits_{n=0}^N a_n x^n = 0+1x^1+ 4x^2 + 8x^3 + \cdots$ using the method in the book. So, I find a recursive formula for $a_{n+1}=a_n + 2n +1$ then multiply on both sides by $x^n$ and sum over n. Next I replace every instance of $S(x)$ I can find with ""$S(x)$"" and then solve for $S(x)$. $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n+1}x^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n x^n + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2n x^n + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n$$ But, this is just: $$\frac{S(x)- a_0}{x} = S(x) + 2 \frac{x}{(1-x)^2} + \frac{1}{1-x}$$ But, when I solve for S(x) I get $S(x) = \dfrac{x(1+x)}{(1-x)^3}$, but the solution in the book is $(xD)^2\left(\dfrac{1}{1-x}\right)$. 
And $(xD)^2\left(\dfrac{1}{1-x}\right) = -\dfrac{x(1+x)}{(1-x)^3}$. Two questions: Why do I have the wrong sign? How would I know that my answer could be written in terms of differential operators like that? Maybe there is a better way of solving that would give me differential operators right away?
