I have checked that inverse exists, and $\Delta=7$. The answer is $\frac37$. What I did, is by ( not so )simple computation, I worked out that every matrix of the form 
$\begin{pmatrix}

Motivated by this, I was wondering if in certain cases, knowledge of cohomologies with line bundle coefficients implies knowledge of the cohomologies with arbitrary coherent coefficients. For example, suppose that $X$ is a smooth quasi-projective variety (over $\mathbb C$) such that $H^i (X, \mathcal L) = 0$ for $i > 0$ and all line bundles $\mathcal L$; and suppose that all vector bundles are decomposable (i.e. as direct sums of line bundles).

1828551,Polynomials with degree $5$ solvable in elementary functions?,"Quadratic, cubic and quartic polynomials are solvable in radicals, so there is no question here. What about the polynomials of degree $5$ (quintic)? Do we know all such polynomials (classes of polynomials) with all (or some) of the roots expressible as elementary functions of the coefficients? If we do, I would be glad for a reference. If we don't (or it hasn't been proven that we do) then it might be possible to find a new class of solvable quintics? Elementary functions are understood in the usual sense: algebraic functions, exponents, logarithms, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions and some finite combination of the above. Which means that I'm not interested in the solution using Bring radicals, Hypergeometric functions etc. A related question Information on polynomials of higher degree would be appreciated as well. The other (more practical) question - is there a complete list of known quintics solvable in elementary functions? (Not necessarily in radicals). Edit The importaint point: If at least one root of the quintic can be expressed as elementary function, then all its roots can be expressed as elementary functions, since the general quartic is solved in radicals. I think this greatly simplifies the problem. For example, the following quintic has a root expressed as elementary function: $$x^5-5ax^4-10x^3+10ax^2+5x-a=0 \tag{1}$$ $$x_1=\tan \left( \frac{1}{5} \arctan a \right)$$ Then we can divide $(1)$ by $(x-x_1)$ and obtain a quartic equation with all the roots expressible in radicals.

1828794,Points with power distances,"It's possible for seven points to be at integral distances .  I'm dallying with powered triangles , though, so I'm looking for point sets where all distances are powers of a fixed $x$ value. For example, consider the root $x=1.15096...$ from $x^6 -x^2-1=0$. It's possible to set up five points in the configuration below, with the edge lengths representing $x^n$. Can 5 points be picked so that the 10 power distances are all distinct, with no three points on a line?  Without the line restrictions, it's easy.  Drop the double 3 point and extend the 0 and 5 segments to get a point with distances -2, 3, 4, and 9. Or drop the double 3, extend the 2 segment 10 away from the 027 point for a point distance 11, 12, 13 from points 018, 125, and 578. The unit pentagon gives a less interesting solution, with $x$ being the golden ratio and all power distances 0 or 1. Can the golden ratio support a five point set with more than five distinct power lengths if no 3 points are on a line and no four points are on a circle? Various 5 point sets can be picked from the below by avoiding red lines. The square root of the golden ratio, $x=\sqrt{\phi}$, as seen in the Ammann chair , fares better with 7 distinct distances out of 10.

In a previous problem I showed that there is a countable collection of open intervals, $\{(c_k,d_k)\}_k$, contained in $(a,b)$ for which each point in $E$ is contained in infinitely many intervals of the collection and $\sum_k |(c_k,d_k)|=\sum_kd_k-c_k<\infty.$ Define $f(x)=\sum_k|(c_k,d_k)\cap(-\infty,x)|$ for $x \in (a,b)$. Show $f$ is increasing and fails to be differentiable for every point in $E$. The absolute value bars mean measure of the interval.

This is where I am having trouble. First from using what I did above to show that $f$ is increasing I found that for $t>0$ $$ A_t(f(x))= \dfrac{f(x+t)-f(x)}{t}=\dfrac{1}{t}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|(c_k,d_k)\cap[x,x+t)| $$ So at this point what we know is that if $x\in E$ then $x$ belongs to $(c_k,d_k)$ for infinitely many $k$ and $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|(c_k,d_k)\cap[x,x+t)|$ converges since $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|(c_k,d_k)|<\infty$. But Im not sure how to find the $\sup_{0<|t|\le h}$ and $\inf_{0<|t|\le h}$ of $A_t(f(x))$ I think that $\inf_{0<|t|\le h}A_t(f(x))=0$ and $\sup_{0<|t|\le h}A_t(f(x))>0$ but I dont know how to show it.

It got me wondering however, whether these expressions are really equal, specifically in the case $x=2$, where the former expression is undefined but the latter takes the value $\frac{1}{3}$. Since the expressions only differ at a single point are they for all intents and purposes equal, or are they theoretically different? If I wanted to be entirely correct would I have to write $\frac{x-2}{3x-6}=\frac{1}{3}$ where $x \neq 2$?

1828894,Show that a cadlag adapted martingale is a local martingale (help using DCT to show uniform integrability),"EDIT 2: With the correct definition, I think I have a proof. Want to show $\lim_{M\to\infty} \sup_t E[|X_{t\wedge n}|; |X_{t\wedge n}|\ge M]=0$. Fix $n$. Note that $\sup_t E[|X_{t\wedge n}; |X_{t\wedge n}|\ge M]=\sup_{t\in [0,n]} E[|X_{t}|; |X_{t}|\ge M]<\infty$ (left-limits existing implies bounded on compact intervals [need to verify; know it's true if left and right limits exist]). Then DCT gives the rest, since for $\epsilon>0$ given and each $t$, there exists $M(t)>0$ so that $E[|X_{t\wedge n}|;|X_{t\wedge n}|\ge M(t)]<\epsilon$. Let $K=\sup_{t\in[0,n]} M(t)$. Then for $M\ge K$, $\sup_t E[|X_{t\wedge n}|; |X_{t\wedge n}|\ge M]<\epsilon$. EDIT 1: I've just noticed that I misread the definition of local martingale - $n$ should be fixed, and $X_{t\wedge n}$ should be uniformly integrable in $t$, not in $n$. Will update ASAP with new attempt. My attempts below use the wrong definition, so nothing to see there. Preface: I've seen the duplicate question ( Demonstrate that every martingale is a local martingale. ), but I'm also hoping for a proof-specific hint about how to use the dominated convergence theorem to show uniform integrability. Claim: A cadlag (right continuous with left-limits existing) adapted martingale $X=\{X_t\}_{t\ge0}$  is a local martingale (i.e. there exists a sequence of increasing stopping times $T_n$ with $\lim_{n\to\infty} T_n=\infty$ so that $X_{t \wedge T_n}1_{T_n>0}$ is a uniformly integrable martingale for each $n$). We are given the hint that $T_n=n$ suffices. [Notation: $a\wedge b=\min(a,b)$.] My progress: I've shown that $X$ is an adapted martingale, so it remains to show uniform integrability. I've observed that $X_{t\wedge n}\to X_t$ as $n\to\infty$ a.s., $E|X_t|<\infty$ for every $t$ fixed, and for $Y=\max(|X_t|,|X_n|)$, $|X_{t\wedge n}|\le Y$, and $E|Y|<\infty$. So the conditions for DCT are met, and we have $E[X_{t\wedge n}]\to E[X_t]$, and hence $E|X_t|-E|X_{t\wedge n}|\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$. We want to show $\lim_{M\to\infty} \sup_n E[|X_{t\wedge n}|; |X_{t\wedge n}|\ge M]=0$. Since $E|X_t|<\infty$ for all $t$, we know $E[|X_t|;|X_t|\ge M]\to 0$ as $M\to\infty$. It seems like $\{|X_{t\wedge n}|\ge M\}\to \{|X_t|\ge M\}$ for $n$ large enough, so we should have something like $E[|X_{t\wedge n}|; |X_{t\wedge n}|\ge M]\to E[|X_t|;|X_t|\ge M]$, in which case we'd be done. Is this idea justified formally, or should I be taking a different approach? Thanks in advance!","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'martingales', 'local-martingales']"

At a first look, the series is definitely convergent if $|q|<1$, with some vague hopes of not-horrible behaviour at the edge of the unit disk. However, as it turns out, not only does the series in the definition above diverge for $|q|>1$, but the theta function simply cannot be analytically continued past the edge of the unit disk, where it has a natural boundary. I would like to understand exactly how the existence of this natural boundary, and the impossibility of analytical continuation beyond it, arises and how it can be rigorously proved. What is the cleanest, most flexible way of showing it's there?

The number of ways in which we can pick 2 seats out of $6$ is $P(6, 2)$ (I think a case can be made for both permutation and combination).

Here was my basic approach: Solutions = Permutations of N - Permutations of N that contain a pair in K Permutations of N = nPn = n! Every item in K will occur in each permutation of N so we loop through: You place down one item of K
 Possibilities where the next is in K = K - 1
 You place down an item of K 
 possibilities where next is in k = k-2
 ...
 You place the last item in K The total permutations with a pair would therefore be: $  (k-1) + (k-2) + ... + 0 $ However, many of those entries are duplicates, so we have to rule out instances where two of those pairs occurred in one set, and then again rule out instances that occurred three times, up pairs occurred k times I think the amount with two pairs would best be found by getting the amount with one pair minus the amount with no more. To do this I would loop as: You place two items in K
There are k-2 chances the next item is in k
You place an item in K
There are k-3 chances the next item is in k
...
You place your last item in K Total permutations with two pairs $= (k - 2) + (k - 3) + ... + 0$ Total permutations with three pairs $= (k - 3) + (k - 4) + ... + 0$ And so on.. And at this point I know I am incorrect, because I would get a total of: $( (k-1) + (k-2) + ... + 0 ) - ( (k-2) + (k-3) + ... + 0 ) - ( (k-3) + (k-4) + ... + 0 ) + ... + 0$ permutations that contain pairs. This number is waaay negative... As I pointed out at the end of that, my solution finds a negative amount of permutations that have pairs in them, and so it is clearly wrong. If someone could explain my error, or else show a better way to approach the problem, I would greatly appreciate it.

Since $\sigma_1(q), \ldots, \sigma_l(q)$ are  linearly independent the homomorphism $\phi'$ is injective and thus an isomorphism on each fiber. We conclude that $\phi$ is a bundle isomorphism and $$\phi'^{-1}(E' \cap \pi^{-1}(U)) = U \times V'$$ and therefore $E'$ is a total space of a rank $l$ subbundle.

1829400,"Proof verification needed on exercise: a product of finitely many continuous functions $f_i:X\to\mathbb{R}$, $X$ compact and Hausdorff","I'm preparing for a qualifying exam in the fall, and I'm attempting the following exercise: Let $n\geq 1$ and
  $$
\big\{f_i\,:\,X\to\mathbb{R}\,|\,i=1,\ldots ,n\big\}
$$
  be a finite family of continuous functions such that, for each pair of distinct points $x,y\in X$, there exists $i,\,1\leq i\leq n$, with $f_i(x)\neq f_i(y)$. Show that $X$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ I believe I have a proof (feel free to scroll past): My Attempt Let $F:X\to\mathbb{R}^n$ be the function given by
$$
F(x)=\big(f_1(x),\ldots , f_n(x)\big).
$$
Suppose that $F(x)=F(y)$. Then
$$
\big(f_1(x),\ldots , f_n(x)\big)=\big(f_1(y),\ldots , f_n(y)\big)
$$
and $f_i(x)=f_i(y)$ for each $i$. If $x\neq y$, this would directly contradict our assumption on the $f_i$, so $x=y$ and $F$ is injective, and hence bijective onto its image, which is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. If $(p_1,\ldots, p_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is an open set containing $p$, then via the product topology there exists an $\varepsilon>0$ such that
$$
\Delta:=\underbrace{(p_1-\varepsilon, p_1+\varepsilon)\times\cdots\times(p_n-\varepsilon, p_n+\varepsilon)}_{n\text{-times}}\subset U,
$$
and since the $f_i$ are continuous, each $f_i^{-1}(p_i-\varepsilon,p_i+\varepsilon)$ is open in $X$. We claim that
$$
F^{-1}(\Delta)=\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}f_i^{-1}(p_i-\varepsilon,p_i+\varepsilon).
$$
If $u\in F^{-1}(\Delta)$, then $|f_i(u)-p_i|<\varepsilon$ for all $i$ and the forward direction is proved (the former is a subset of the latter). If $v\in\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}f_i^{-1}(p_i-\varepsilon,p_i+\varepsilon)$, then $|f_i(v)-p_i|<\varepsilon$ for all $i$. Thus $v\in F^{-1}(\Delta)$ and the backward direction is proved (the latter is a subset of the former). Since $F^{-1}(\Delta)$ is an intersection of finitely many open sets, it is open, and hence $F$ is continuous Lastly, any bijective and continuous map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism, so we are done. Questions My concern is this: I don't believe I've used the hypothesis that $X$ was Hausdorff, which leads to me to believe I have made a mistake somewhere. This is a question from a previous qualifier (a timed exam) so maybe there were hypotheses added to make a proof easier and so less time consuming? Is this is a correct method of proof?

1829413,Is there any probability model for multi-stage motion of an object such as this.,"I have this following case (please refer to attached pic below)
where a particle is resting on the ground and it needs a minimum amount of force ( Fmin ) to reach from one level to the next level. But if at any level it receives F which is more than Fmin , then the excess force can be carried forward to the next levels, and hence even a force less than Fmin will be enough for it to go to the next level. The force F follows a two-sided truncated gaussian distribution, and has only positive values. So the probability that the object moves from 0 to 1 is P0=P(F>Fmin) where F = two-sided truncated gaussian distribution with specified mean, and std. dev. Now suppose, when the particle was at level 0, it received force F0>Fmin , reached level 1, and now the probability to go from 1 to 2 P1 = P(F>(Fmin-excess F it received earlier) = P(F>Fmin-(F0-Fmin)) = P(F>2Fmin-F0) At level 1, it had received force F1 , so now probability from level 2 to 3 is P2 = P(F>3Fmin-(F0+F1)) and again from level 3 to target is P3 = P(F>4Fmin-(F0+F1+F2)) So, here the probability at any level is dependent on the F values it received in the previous stages. I guess the final probability can be written as P = P0*P1*P2*P3 Is there any probability model for this type of multi-stage motion? How can I model this problem. Any help or suggestions. If my question is not clear,  please let me know. Thanks. Edit 1 : If it receives more than Fmin at level 0, it will definitely reach level 1, and can even reach level 2, or even the target level depending on the F magnitude. Suppose at level 0 it receives only Fmin , so it reaches level 1, but at level 1 it receives less than Fmin , In this case it falls to the below level that is level 0. Suppose this thing happens at level 2, then the particle falls back to level 1 initially, and if it doesn't get Fmin even at level 1, it finally goes to level 0. So the particle cannot stay in any level for an extended time, except level 0 where it is waiting for Fmin . At other levels, it if doesn't have Fmin it falls back to the below level. Edit 2: The force distribution is updated to a two-sided truncated Gaussian distribution to have only positive forces. and to reflect the possibility that the particle may not even reach the target eventually. The particle receives a force at all levels, irrespective of the force magnitude it received at previous levels. For clarity I must add that if the particle falls down even by 1 level, all the accumulated excesses are now gone, and it will again need at least Fmin to again start over from its present level. Simulated this motion in Matlab. So I am just adding an output image which demonstrates one of the many possible up-and-down movements of the particle until the target level is reached. Hope it will make the question easier to understand. Edit 3: Added the updated image of the particle motion. Hope this helps.","['probability', 'mathematical-modeling', 'probability-distributions']"

So, does there exist a function for which this condition holds? Deriving (2): $\ (f')^{-1}(x) = (f^{-1})'(x) = \frac{1}{(f' \circ f^{-1})(x)} \iff (f' \circ f^{-1})(x) = \frac{1}{(f')^{-1}(x)}$ . Then mapping by $\ f$ from the right gives $\ f'(x)=\frac{1}{(f')^{-1}(f(x))}$ and mapping by $\ \frac{1}{f'}$ from the left $\ \frac{1}{f(x)} = (\frac{1}{f'} \circ f')(x) \iff f(x)= \frac{1}{(\frac{1}{f'} \circ f')(x)}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{(f' \circ f')(x)}}=(f' \circ f')(x)$","['derivatives', 'inverse-function', 'power-series']"
1829540,"Prove that if fewer than $n$ students in class are initially infected, the whole class will never be completely infected.","During 6.042, the students are sitting in an $n$ × $n$ grid. A sudden outbreak of beaver flu
(a rare variant of bird flu that lasts forever; symptoms include yearning for problem sets
and craving for ice cream study sessions) causes some students to get infected. Here is an
example where $n = 6$ and infected students are marked ×. Example. Now the infection begins to spread every minute (in discrete time-steps). Two students are
considered adjacent if they share an edge (i.e., front, back, left or right, but NOT diagonal);
thus, each student is adjacent to $2, 3,$ or $4$ others. A student is infected in the next time step
if either: the student was previously infected (since beaver flu lasts forever), or the student is adjacent to at least two already-infected students. In the example, the infection spreads as shown below. Example. In this example, over the next few time-steps, all the students in class become infected. Theorem. If fewer than $n$ students in class are initially infected, the whole class will never
be completely infected. Prove this theorem. Hint: When one wants to understand how a system such as the above “evolves” over time,
it is usually a good strategy to (1) identify an appropriate property of the system at the
initial stage, and (2) prove, by induction on the number of time-steps, that the property is
preserved at every time-step. So look for a property (of the set of infected students) that
remains invariant as time proceeds. Source: MIT OCW Mathematics for Computer Science, Problem Set 2, Problem 3. I am not really sure of how I can prove this. I went out on a limb and assumed that I would be using induction since this seems like a problem that requires an invariant to be used to prove the theorem. Another thing that I have realized is that if $k$ students are initially infected, then the perimeter of the figure formed by the infected students as the infection spread is at most $4k$. So, this might be my invariant. So, this is what I have thus far: Theorem: If fewer than $n$ students in class are initially infected, the whole class will never
be completely infected. Proof: by induction I would appreciate any and all hints that would help me get the ball rolling with this proof.","['invariance', 'discrete-mathematics']"

1829577,"Why can we interchange ""primes"" and ""irreducibles"" in the definition of UFD?","On Wikipedia, UFD is defined as an integral domain in which every element can be uniquely factored as product of primes (irreducibles), up to multiplication by units and arrangement. My question is about why primes or irreducibles can be interchangeably placed in definition. I mean, in other words, are following two definitions equivalent? (1) $R$ is an integral domain in which every element can be uniquely factored as product of primes (up to unit multiplication and permutation). (2) $R$ is an integral domain in which every element can be uniquely factored as product of irreducibles (up to unit multiplication and permutation). (from comments below, my question actually boils down to following:) If in a domain, every element can be uniquely factored into product of primes, then certainly it can be decomposed into irreducibles; how can we ensure uniqueness into irreducible factorization?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'unique-factorization-domains', 'definition']"

Needless to say I am pretty poor in Mathematics and I need help understanding some of the proofs. If anyone has any suggestions on how to understand these problems please let me know. I am on Page 3 Section 7.2.1.1-: Another way to define the sequence $\Gamma_n = g(0),g(1),..g(2^n-1)$
  is to give explicit formula for its individual elements. [...] When $k=2^n+r$, where $0\leq r < 2^n$, relation (5) tells us that
  $g(k)$ is equal to $2^n+g(2^n-1-r)$. Therefore we can prove by
  induction on $n$ that the integer $k$ whose binary representation is
  $(\ldots b_2b_1b_0)_2$ has a Gray binary equivalent $g(k)$ with the
  representation $(\ldots a_2a_1a_0)_2$ where
  $$a_j = b_j \oplus b_{j+1}\quad\text{for $j\geq0$}$$ [...] by inverting the system of equations [we get]:$$b_j=a_j \oplus a_{j+1}
 \oplus a_{j+2} \oplus\cdots \quad\text{for $j\geq0$} $$ Okay now my questions are as follows-: Why is $k=2^n+r$ ? What is $r$ ? If $k$ representts the nth term for which the Gray code is calculated then why is it $2^n+r$ ? Isn't that more than the number of possible combinations ? Can someone tell me the induction proof that is done to get the formula for the Gray code from binary ? That is, what is the intuition behind the XOR ing two binary digits to get one gray digit ? It says that if we invert the system of equations we get back the binary from the Gray Code, but what I don't understand is that only two binary digits are required to get one Gray Code digit, but how come when obtaining binary from Gray we have to XOR all digits of Gray Code ? How is that inverting the equations ? Also if anyone has any advice on how make reading this book easy, please let me know.","['combinatorics', 'induction']"
