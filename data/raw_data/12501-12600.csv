97737,Bloom of Thymaridas,"I'm interested in learning more about the Bloom of Thymaridas, a description of which can be found here . Obviously the mathematics behind the identity is not particularly deep from a modern standpoint.

97764,What is the difference between tensors and tensor products?,"The tensor product $S\otimes_R T$ of $S$ and $N$ over $R$ is a module. A multilinear form $L:V^r \to R$ is called an $r$-tensor on $V$. On the one hand a tensor is a function sending elements of $V^r$ to $R$. But a tensor product has no notion of a function sending elements from something to something. So why are tensor products called tensor products and why are tensors called tensors? How does one make the connection between tensor products and tensors? Is there a reason why they both have the word ""tensor"" in them even though one of them is a function but the other is not?","['tensor-products', 'tensors', 'abstract-algebra']"
97776,If $\frac{\sin{a_n}}{a_n}\rightarrow 1$ then $a_n\rightarrow0 $,"I'm trying to prove that if $\;\frac{\sin{a_n}}{a_n}\rightarrow 1$ then $a_n\rightarrow0$, assuming $a_n\neq 0$ for all $n$. I think this is easy enough to show as follows: first, prove $f(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{x},f(0)=1$ has a global maximum at 0, then assume by negation that not $a_n\rightarrow0$, and reach a contradiction with epsilon-delta gymnastics. But this will turn out to be a long and somewhat messy proof. Is there a more elegant way to prove this?

97805,irreducibility of a polynomial in several variables over ANY field,"The irreeducibility of a polynomial $f\!\in\!K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ in general depends on what the field $K$ is (for example, if $K=\mathbb{R}$, then $f=x_1^2+1$ is irreducible, but if $K=\mathbb{C}$, it is not). However, when $n\geq2$, there exist polynomials that are irreducible no matter what $K$ is (for example $x_i-x_j^d$ where $d\in\mathbb{N}$ is arbitrary and $i\neq j$, is always irreducible). Question: Is there a command in any computer algebra system (preferably SINGULAR), that could (in some cases) confirm if a polynomial is irreducible over any field? For example, in A Singular Introduction to Commutative Algebra , page 222, there is written: Since there is mention of the quotient field $Q(A)$, this means $A$ is a domain, i.e. $x^4+6x^2y-y^3$ is irreducible.

If we look at the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ of $G$, we get the canonical epimorphism $\varphi: G\to G/[G,G]$ Since $[G,G]$ is characteristic in $G$, we know that $Aut(G)$ acts in a natural way on the factor group $G/[G,G]$ and we get a map: $\Phi:\mathrm{Aut}(G)\to \mathrm{Aut} (G/[G,G]);\alpha(g) \mapsto \bar{\alpha}(g*[G,G]):=\alpha(g)*[G,G]$ But how can I show that $\Phi$ is an epimorphism ? Added. When I was asking the question we were in the general case, where $G$ is an arbitrary group. Because of some answers, I edited the question into the case, where $G=F_n$, the free group of rank $n$. Thanks to the last comment, I now know that there is a solution in the book ""Combinatorial Group Theory"" from Magnus. I don't have the book beside me. So does someone knows a proof for the existence of the epimorphism $\Phi$. 
I think, if we assume that $Aut(F_n)$ is generated by the right nielsen transformations, we only have to show that $Aut(F_n/[F_n,F_n])$ is generated by these trasnformations, since we know that every $\alpha\in Aut(F_n)$ induces an $\bar{\alpha}\in Aut(F_n/[F_n,F_n])$.

97851,Question on $\frac{d}{d \ln{x}}$,"Suppose you have the following operator:
$$
\left( \frac{d}{dx}\circ x -1 \right),

where $\frac{d}{dx}\circ x$ means ""multiply by $x$ and then take the derivative of the product"". Applying this on $(\ln {x})^m$ gives
$$

97891,Approximation of Products of Truncated Prime $\zeta$ Functions,"The problem arose, while I was looking at products of power prime zeta functions $$
P_x(ks)=\sum_{p\,\in\mathrm{\,primes}\leq x} p^{-ks},
$$
with $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and $s=it$ with real $t$. 
By using ( see here )
$$
\sum_{p\leq x}p^{-s}= \mathrm{li}(x^{1-s}) + O \left( {2|s|x^{1/2}}\log x \right)
$$
I get (omitting the error terms for the moment)
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
P_x(ks)P_x(ms) &\sim& 
\text{li}(x^{1-ks})\text{li}(x^{1-ms})
&=&\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\ln( x^{1-ks} u_k) \ln(x^{1-ms}u_m)} du_k du_m\\
&=&{\rm Ei}(1-ks){\rm Ei}(1-ms)&&\\
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
How can I simplify this expression? Non-trivial approximations are also welcome, when bounds are given. Convolution: Since $\text{li}(x^{1-s})=\int_0^{x^{1-s}}(\ln u)^{-1}du$, I thought Integration of Convolutions , with something like
$$\int(f*g)(x) \, dx=\left(\int f(x) \, dx\right)\left(\int g(x) \, dx\right)
$$
might help, since my problem also deals with products of integrals? Special Case: When I allow negative values for $k$ and $m$ and set $m=-k$ and get the following
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
P_x(ks)P_x(-ks)&=&\pi(x) + \sum_{j<m}2\cos (\ln \frac{p_j}{p_k})\\
&\sim& \frac{x^{2}}{(1-ks)(1+ks)(\log x)^2}=\frac{1}{(1-(k|s|)^2)}\frac{x^{2}}{(\log x)^2}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
The approximation has only real value, as the original expression had. The following function has the same approximation
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{\left(1-(k|s|\right)^2)} \text{li}^2(x),\\
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
which would very wealky support something like
$$
P_x(ks)P_x(-ks) \sim \int_0^{x^{1-ks}} \frac{1}{\ln u} du\int_0^{x^{1+ks}} \frac{1}{\ln u} du \sim K(k,s)\times \left(\int_0^{x} \frac{1}{\ln u} du\right)^2 .

A typical paper would be : Multidimensional Scaling Using Majorization: SMACOF in R or FastMap, MetricMap, and Landmark MDS are all Nystrom Algorithms A simple short lecture: UToronto's lecture The techniques are very different (Fréchet embedding vs optimization techniques or spectral methods).. and hence I wonder whether these problems are actually different ?

97929,Changing the argument for a higher order derivative,"I start with the following: $$\frac{d^n}{dx^n} \left[(1-x^2)^{n+\alpha-1/2}\right]$$ Which is part of the Rodrigues definition of a Gegenbauer polynomial.  Gegenbauer polynomials are also useful in terms of trigonometric functions so I want to use the substitution $x = \cos\theta$, which is the usual way of doing it.  However, I'm stuck as to how this works for the Rodrigues definition, because it gives me a derivative with respect to $\cos\theta$ instead of a derivative with respect to $\theta$: $$\frac{d^n}{d(\cos\theta)^n} \left[(\sin^2\theta)^{n+\alpha-1/2}\right]$$ QUESTION: Is there a way to write this as $\dfrac{d^n}{d\theta^n}[\text{something}]$? I have read some about Faa di Bruno's formula for the $n$-th order derivative of a composition of functions but it doesn't seem to do what I want to do. Also, for n=1 there is the identity, from the chain rule, $\dfrac{d}{d(\cos\theta)} \left[(\sin^2\theta)^{n+\alpha-1/2}\right]=\frac{\frac{d}{d\theta} \left[(\sin^2\theta)^{n+\alpha-1/2}\right]}{\frac{d}{d\theta} \left[\cos\theta\right]}$, but this doesn't hold for higher order derivatives.

98092,"I want to study mathematics ahead of high school, but I found that I'm rusty on the elementary stuff","Next week, I'm beginning the 2nd semester of 9th grade in the country's leading Comp Sci High School. (the profile is actually Math-Comp Sci, but this HS focuses more on Comp Sci, whereas other ones focus more on math). What I did in grades 5th-8th (and that I should know almost perfectly) is from natural numbers (5th, arithmetic) all the way to linear equalities and inequalities, 2nd degree equations (8th grade) with a dash of plane and some 3D geometry. Judging by the results of my HS admission test, I should know these things pretty well, but it seems to me as if I don't have a good grasp (I'm getting rusty, or in fact never been that good). Now, in the 9th grade, it happened that I have the worst math teacher in the entire high school (other teachers complain about him, from the ones that teach Comp Sci to the geography ones, all the students complain about him). He just comes in class, writes the basic definitions of something, shows us no practical examples (well, not practical, but how to solve the exercises involving them) and he gives obscene amounts of homework (I checked with other HS math teachers). So, basically, what I need is this: something that I can study on my own (so, a book with examples, lots of exercises in the entire difficulty spectrum and solutions would be great) to get a really firm grip on basic geometry (similar triangles, Pythagorean theorem, the really basic stuff), the algebra from 5th-8th (including the arithmetic parts, like properties of $a \vdots b$ then $a \vdots nb$) and then a good resource for the highlights of high school (so I can get a good grip of what I currently should be studying, but can't because of the poor teacher), plus the stuff from higher years (logarithms, complex numbers etc.). Why I'm asking this question? Because I decided I want to learn Real Analysis, and found that while I understood all the concepts, I couldn't handle the exercises and I had difficulties with the rather basic stuff (linear eqs. and so on). Sorry if the location isn't quite right, but this seemed like the best place to ask this question.

Example of invalid proof: Define the truncated Fourier series $F_n(x)$ as the partial sum $$F_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} A_k\sin\biggl(\frac{kx}{T}\biggr) + B_k\cos\biggl(\frac{kx}{T}\biggr)$$ where $A_k$ and $B_k$ are the Fourier coefficients for some arbitrary function $f$. Using the facts that $\sin(t)$ and $\cos(t)$ are analytic, and that any linear combination of analytic functions is analytic: $P(n)$ is the statement ""$F_n(x)$ is analytic"" $F_0(x)$ is clearly analytic because it is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions $F_n(x)$ can be written as the linear combination $$F_{n}(x) = F_{n-1}(x) + A_n\sin\biggl(\frac{nx}{T}\biggr) + B_n\cos\biggl(\frac{nx}{T}\biggr)$$ So if $F_{n-1}(x)$ is analytic, $F_n(x)$ is analytic. $F(x) \equiv \lim_{n\to\infty} F_n(x)$ is analytic. But $F(x)$ is the Fourier series for $f$; therefore, the Fourier series for $f$ is analytic. * I'm assuming that $P(n)$ is a statement about some sequence which is parametrized by $n$ and for which taking the limit as $n\to\infty$ is meaningful","['induction', 'real-analysis']"

Let $\mathtt{J}_\mathbf{d}$ be the Jacobian of $\mathbf{d}$ and $\mathtt{H}_\mathbf{d}$  its second derivative, the $n\times m \times m$ Hessian tensor. Due to the product rule, the  first derivative of $F$ becomes:

""Consider the regular n-gon inside the circle touching the circle at its vertices, and the regular n-gon outside the circle touching the circle at its edges. Then the circumference of the inner n-gon is smaller than the circumference of the circle, which is smaller than the circumference of the outer n-gon."" While this apparently is true for n-gons, it is not true for arbitrary geometric shapes inside and outside the circle. So we conjectured it was the convexity of the n-gon that is of importance. Which leads to the question: Let $C$ be a circle with radius $r$, and $A_n$ be a family of convex sets with $A_n \subset C$ for each $n$.

98263,Derivations and separability of field extensions,"This is written on page 4 of James E.

If $F$ is a subfield of $E$, $\delta$ is called an $F$-derivation if in addition $\delta(x)=0$ for all $x \in F$ (so $\delta$ is $F$-linear). Then the author said: The space $\operatorname{Der}_F(E,L)$ of all $F$-derivations $E \rightarrow L$ is a vector space over $L$, whose dimension equals the transcendence degree of $E$ over $F$ if $E/F$ is separably generated. $E/F$ is separable if and only if all derivations $F \rightarrow L$ extend to derivations $E \rightarrow L$ ($L$ an extension field of $E$). I am confused by the last statement. Let $F = F_5 = \{0,1,2,3,4 \} $, the field of $5$ elements, and $E$ the splitting field of $x^5 -2$ over $F$. For any extension field $L$ of $E$, any derivation $\delta: F \rightarrow L$ must be the zero map (because of the two conditions). So the zero map from $E$ to $L$ is the extension of $\delta$ to $E$. But, $E/F$ is obviously inseparable. Where am I wrong? Are there any references or hints as to the proof of the statement? Sincere thanks. I was wrong because $F$ is perfect and the extension is trivial. Now, please allow me to ask for some references or hints as to the proof of: $E/F$ is separable if and only if all derivations $F\rightarrow L$ extend to derivations $E\rightarrow L$, where $L$ is an extension field of $E$.","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

If we get this 'feeling', then theorem is just natural and obvious : there must exist at least one x for, $f'(x)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}=m$ I realize if I think like this way to get the mathematical feeling behind definitions or theorems, then most of them are just natural , for example, fundamental theorem of calculus, if a function $f(x)$, we consider function value as changing-rate, $$\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_i)(x_{i}-x_{i-1})\right]$$ is just how much the original function-value changes, i.e. $\Delta F(x)=F(b)-F(a)$ But for some other things which always called rules, it seems cannot be understood directly , like the Chain rule, I could prove it by basic definition of derivative, but just cannot 'feel' it as the same way with Mean-Value theorem.",['calculus']

98378,$f(x)= {}^tx^{-1}$ is an automorphism of GL$_n(\mathbb{R})$,"This is a question from the free Harvard online abstract algebra lectures .  I'm posting my solutions here to get some feedback on them.  For a fuller explanation, see this post. This problem is assigned in the 4th lecture. Define $f:GL_n(\mathbb{R}) → GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ by $f(A)=^tA^{-1}$ (where $^tA$ is the transpose of $A$ ).  Show that $f$ is an automorphism, but not an inner automorphism for n ≥ 1. Let $A,B\in GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ .  Then $f(AB)={}^t(AB)^{-1}=({}^tB^tA)^{-1}={}^tA^{-1}\cdot{}^tB^{-1}=f(A)\cdot f(B)$ .  So $f$ is a homomorphism.  For any $A \in GL_n(\mathbb{R}), f(f(A))=f({}^tA^{-1})={}^t({}^tA^{-1})^{-1}=A$ .  So $f^{-1}=f$ .  Since $f$ has an inverse for all $A\in GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ , $f$ is bijective.  Therefore, $f$ is an automorphism of $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ . Assume $f$ is an inner automorphism.  Let $A=\lambda I_n$ .  Since $A$ is in the center of $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ , there is some $B \in GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ such that $f(A)=BAB^{-1} = BB^{-1}A=A$ .  But ${}^tA^{-1}=\frac{1}{\lambda}I_n\neq A$ for $\lambda\neq1$ .  Therefore, $f$ is not an inner automorphism. Again, I welcome any critique of my reasoning and/or my style as well as alternative solutions to the problem.

98380,Justifying exchange of limits in a double sum - a dubious proof,"It is a standard theorem (given in Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis , page 175, and many other places), that if $\{a_{ij}\}$ is a doubly indexed sequence, and $$\sum_{j=1}^\infty |a_{ij}| = b_i$$and $\sum b_i$ converges, then 
$$\sum_{j=1}^\infty\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_{ij} = \sum_{i=1}^\infty\sum_{j=1}^\infty a_{ij}$$ Rudin gives a proof relying on standard facts about uniform convergence. However, he also notes that the theorem can be proved directly. Below, I give a ""proof"" that I have some reservations about. Proof: First, we want to prove that for any integer $M$, $$\sum_{j=1}^\infty\sum_{i=1}^Ma_{ij} = \sum_{i=1}^M \sum_{j=1}^\infty a_{ij}.$$ To prove this, we use the addition rule for series: if $\sum a_i = A$ and $\sum b_i = B$, then $\sum (a_i+b_i) = A + B$. On the right hand side of the equation, we have $M$ sums of the form $$\sum_{j=1}^\infty a_{ij} = c_i$$ Using the addition rule $M$ times yields $$\sum_{i=1}^M \sum_{j=1}^\infty a_{ij}= \sum_1^M c_i =\sum_{j=1}^\infty (a_{1j}+ a_{2j}+\cdots+a_{Mj})=\sum_{j=1}^\infty\sum_{i=1}^Ma_{ij} $$ Now, by taking the limit as $M$ goes to infinity above, we have reduced the problem to proving $$\lim_{M \to \infty} \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{i=1}^M a_{ij} = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_{ij}.$$ Consider the $M$th partial on the left hand side of the equation. It is $(a_{1,1}+a_{2,1}+\cdots+a_{M,1})+(a_{1,2}+a_{2,2}+\cdots+a_{M,2})+(a_{1,3}+a_{2,3}+\cdots+a_{M,3})+\cdots$. It is not hard to see that by the absolute convergence condition, that this is equal to $a_{1,1}+a_{2,1}+\cdots+a_{M,1}+a_{1,2}+a_{2,2}+\cdots+a_{M,2}+a_{1,3}+a_{2,3}+\cdots+a_{M,3}+\cdots$ (because it is a subsequence), and that this new series is absolutely convergent, so we may rearrange the terms at will. Call this series $S_M$. The right hand side of the equation is:
$
(a_{1,1}+a_{1,2}+a_{1,3}+a_{1,4}+\cdots)+
(a_{2,1}+a_{2,2}+a_{2,3}+a_{2,4}+\cdots)+
(a_{3,1}+a_{3,2}+$ $a_{3,3}+a_{3,4}+\cdots)+\cdots$ ($=\sum b_i$). Fix $\epsilon>0$. We can find $N$ such that $\epsilon > \sum\limits_{N+1}^{\infty} b_i$. We can also find $J$ such that $\epsilon/N > \sum\limits_{j=J+1}^{\infty} a_{ij}$, for $i\le N$. For any $K$, we can rearrange $S$ to be of the form 
$(a_{1,1}+a_{1,2}+a_{1,3}+a_{1,4}+\cdots+a_{1,K})+
(a_{2,1}+a_{2,2}+a_{2,3}+a_{2,4}++\cdots+a_{1,K})+
\cdots$ $+(a_{N,1}+a_{N,2}+a_{N,3}+a_{N,4}+\cdots+a_{N,K})+$ [a convergent tail]. Rearrange $S_K$ to be of this form, with $K>J$ and $K$ large enough that the convergent tail has sum less than $\epsilon$. Subtracting this rearrangement from the right hand side gives the result, because the difference can be estimated in terms of $\epsilon$, which we can make as small as we desire. The first $N$ rows each have the first $K$ terms taken off of them, and the remaining sum in each row is less than $N/\epsilon$, so together the $N$ tails left have sum less than $\epsilon$. By the way $N$ was chosen, the remaining rows constitute a tail of the $b_i$ with sum less than $\epsilon$. Finally, the convergent tail that is being subtracted has sum less than $\epsilon$. Using the triangle inequality shows the difference is less than $3\epsilon$, so the partial sums of the left hand side converge to the right hand side, and we are done. Any comments or suggestions are welcome - I'd like to eventually produce the direct proof Rudin alludes to.","['alternative-proof', 'sequences-and-series', 'proof-writing']"

Very much of the system is in this single expression. Now I see the technical details, the function contains the relevant weights and a sum/integral, which end up producing expectation values if you derive the thing with respect to conjugate parameters. But how can I really understand what's going on? Intuitively. Morally. What makes these kind of systems so that there is one special function, which does this? 
( Here and here two relevant examples I'm interested the most in.) What is the requirement for a system, to contain this conjugate variables business in the first place? They are usually related via an equation of motion or an equation of state...however, these model relations are then eventually also just derived. They are identities involving $Z$. Are there maybe statements about the functional dependencies a $Z$ of it's a priori free model parameters? A more direct formulation: For an initially microscopic system (fields, counting of states and so on) what are the requirements for it and its set of quantities/functions/observables like $X$, such that there is a single valued function/potential, which determines all the $\langle X\rangle$? The point being that you don't have to compute $\langle X\rangle$ like expectation values where $\langle\ \ \rangle$ denotes a complicated functional involving microscopic features. Also, is there a relationship with generating functions and are there reductionists views/mathematical generalizations of the partition function? I have to add that I really understand how phase transitions and renormalization work, maybe that gives an insight.

The proof goes as follows: Using the mean value theorem, the author obtains the statement $$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\ \lim_{k\rightarrow 0}\ f_{xy}(x_0 + \overline{h}, y_0 +\overline{k}) = f_{yx}(x_0, y_0)$$ for some point $\overline{h} \in (0, h)$ and $\overline{k} \in (0, k)$ . Since $\overline{h}$ depends on $k$ , the limit cannot be taken trivially.
From the continuity of $f_{xy}$ we get $$\mid f_{xy}(x,y) - f_{xy}(x_0, y_0)\mid < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$$ for $(x,y)$ within $\delta$ of $(x_0, y_0)$ . If we take $\mid h \mid$ and $\mid k\mid$ small enough, say less than $\frac{\delta}{2}$ , it follows that the point $(x_0 + \overline{h}, y_0 +\overline{k})$ satisfies the limit. So we fix $h$ small enough to obtain $$\mid f_{xy}(x_0 + \overline{h},y_0 + \overline{k}) - f_{xy}(x_0, y_0)\mid < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$$ for $\mid k\mid < \frac{\delta}{2}$ . What he does next is totally lost to me. He says we can take the limit from $k\rightarrow 0$ , and when we do so, the inequality may become an equality (why?). But since we chose $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ initially, we obtain $$\mid \lim_{k\rightarrow 0}\left[f_{xy}(x_0 + \overline{h},y_0 + \overline{k})\right] - f_{xy}(x_0, y_0)\mid \le \frac{\epsilon}{2} < \epsilon$$ from which the limit is established. My main questions concern what exactly he did in the last few steps. How could the inequality possibly become an equality? And it seems to me that what he did is no different than just trivially taking $k$ to zero and then $h$ to zero.","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"

The question occurred to me when I was working on a problem (in Miles Reid's introductory algebraic geometry text) about putting an arbitrary cubic curve in $\mathbb{P}^2$ possessed of an inflection point into normal form $y^2z=x^3+ax^2z+bxz^2+cz^3$. It was necessary to make use of the fact that the group of projective transformations of $\mathbb{P}^2$, which I believe is an 8-dimensional quasi-projective variety, acts transitively on the set of pairs (line, point on that line), which set forms a 3-dimensional variety. I grew curious about what the stabilizer of a particular pair (line, point on that line) looked like. Based on intuition from basic group theory and basic linear algebra, I expected it to be a 5-dimensional subvariety of the group of projective transformations (because $3+5=8$), and this was true: for example if the point is $(1:0:0)$ and the line is spanned by this and $(0:1:0)$ then the stabilizer in question is the quotient group of the (6-dimensional) subgroup of upper triangular $3\times 3$ matrices by its (1-dimensional) center. I got curious if this relationship was true in some general settings. It seemed to me it should be at least in the lie group context, because of something like this: perhaps the derivative of the map $g\mapsto gx$ mentioned in the first paragraph has as kernel the tangent space of $T$? And then the desired result becomes the rank-nullity theorem? But I do not know enough to convince myself that this works.","['lie-groups', 'linear-algebra', 'group-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

98691,Why is it biholomorphic?,"The proof of Theorem 13.5 in ""Lectures on Riemann Surfaces"" by Otto Forster begins by saying Set $U_1:={\mathbb P}^1 \backslash \infty$ and $U_2:={\mathbb P}^1 \backslash 0$.
  Since $U_1 = {\mathbb C}$ and $U_2$ is biholomorphic to ${\mathbb C}$, it follows from (13.4) that $H^1(U_i, {\cal O})=0$. In ""1.5 Examples of Riemann Surfaces"" in the book the maps $\phi_i:U_i \rightarrow {\mathbb C}, i=1,2$ are defined as follows: $\phi_1$ is the identity map and
  $$
\phi_2(z) := 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1/z & \mbox{for} \; z \in {\mathbb C}^*\\
0   & \mbox{for} \; z = \infty
\end{array}
\right.
$$ But, It seems to me that $\phi_2$ cannot be biholomorphic at $\infty$, because since
$\phi_2'(z)=-1/z^2$, $$
\lim_{z\rightarrow \infty} \phi_2'(z) = 0.

98702,Conformal map from the intersection of two disks to the unit disc,"I'm working through past papers for a Complex Analysis class I'm taking and have come across the following problem on conformal maps: Let $\lambda=\frac{1}{2}(1+i \sqrt3)$ and $R$ be the region $$r=\{z \in \mathbb{C} : |z-\lambda|<1 \text{ and } |z-\bar{\lambda}|<1 \}$$ Determine the image of $R$ under the Möbius Transformation $$f(z)=\frac{z}{1-z}$$ and hence find a holomorphic bijection $h$ from $R$ to the unit disc $\mathbb{D}= \{z \in \mathbb{C} : |z|<1 \}$ Thoughts I'm not very comfortable with mapping lens-shaped regions. I think it's significant that as $1$ lies inside $R$, and this is clearly mapping to $\infty$ by $f$ in the extended complex plane, and $0$ is mapped to itself, perhaps this will be the UHP or something similar, though I'm really not sure. Any help would be very appreciated. Best, MM.","['conformal-geometry', 'complex-analysis']"

98741,The Binary Representation in Number Theory?,"I was reading ""Concrete Mathematics"" and confronted the Joseph Problem. I'm astonished that the recurrence equation in binary representation is so simple. i.e. for J(n) say J(345), 
$\text{J(345) = J(}101011001_2\text{)=}10110011_2$ the recurrence function is to shift the binary representation left by one bit. While the representation in base 10 is more complicated: $\text{f(2n) = 2 f(n)-1}$ $\text{f(2n+1) = 2 f(n)+1}$ So I'm wondering if representation in other bases(binary, etc.) may aid to the analyzation of number patterns, hence has some application in number theory.","['discrete-mathematics', 'number-theory']"
98758,On the extension of solutions to ODEs,"I've been trying to grasp some theorems on the extension of solutions and I still have some questions. The theorems say thing about the solution escaping compact sets, being unbounded, etc. but I'm having trouble applying them to concrete equations. Is there any way to estimate the size of the interval of a solution? E.g., given the equation: $x' = 1 + x^2$ how can we know, without explicitly or numerically solving it, that the interval where its solutions are defined has finite longitude?
This is rather easy to see if you solve the equation as you get $x(t) = tan(c + t)$ which is only defined in intervals of finite longitude. But how would one reach the same conclusion just studying $f(x) = 1 + x^2$ ?
Is this even possible? On a related note, how does one go about proving that a solution can be extended to infinity? Thank you in advance.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
98769,"(Graphics Gems IV, Shoemake) From matrix to euler angles explanation","I am trying to understand matrix to Euler angles conversion. So I read Graphics Gems IV, page 222 from Ken Shoemake. It states: ""Suppose we have code to convert a rotation matrix to XEDS angles, $R = R_z(c)R_y(b)R_x(a)$. If we are asked to extract XEDR, $R = R_z(a)R_y(b)R_x(c)$, we use our code as is, and swap $a$ and $c$ afterwards."" Restated (am I wrong??), it means that a $XYZ$ rotation of $(a, b, c)$ around static axes, is equivalent to a $XYZ$ rotation of $(c, b, a)$ around moving axes. This is exactly what they are doing in the source code. In wikipedia , they state instead: ""For either Euler or Tait-Bryan angles, it is very simple to convert from an intrinsic (rotating axes) to an extrinsic (static axes) convention, and vice-versa: just swap the order of the operations. An $(a, b, c)$ rotation using $X-Y-Z$ intrinsic convention is equivalent to a $(c, b, a)$ rotation using $Z-Y-X$ extrinsic convention; this is true for all Euler or Tait-Bryan axis combinations."" Restated (am I wrong 2 ? ), it means that a $XYZ$ rotation of $(a, b, c)$ around static axes, is equivalent to a $ZYX$ rotation of $(c, b, a)$ around moving axes which I can understand if I derive the sequence of rotation in static frames starting from the sequence of rotation in moving frames. If I take a simple example,with no rotation around $Y $nor $Z, R = Rx(a)$ in static frames, Shoemake states that $R = R_z(a)$ in moving frames while wikipedia states that $R = Rx(a)$ in moving frames. Moreover, taking it source code, and converting the same Euler angles with one rotation only and different rotation orders results in different quaternions. Intuitively, I believe that if we are rotating around one axis only, then order does not matter and it should always return the same quaternion. PROBLEM: Everybody is using Shoemake algo for a long time so it HAS to be right and I HAVE to be wrong. Someone could please help to see what I am doing wrong please?
