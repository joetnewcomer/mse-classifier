2302555,Is $X$ irreducible in $R[X]$?,"Suppose we are working with a commutative ring $R$. I am reading a proof where the author writes ""If we are in $R[X]$ and we know that $f\mid X$. Thus either $f$ is a unit multiple of $X$ or it is a unit, so $(f)=(X)$ or $(f)=(1)$."" This seems to assume that $X$ is irreducible in $R[X]$. However I don't know how we would prove this unless we assume $R$ is an integral domain. Solving by hand$$(a_0+a_1X+\cdots+a_nX^n)(b_0+b_1X+\cdots+b_mX^m)=X$$ does not seem to require that one of these polynomials is a unit.

2302599,"Is this integral operator on $L_2(0, \infty)$ compact?","Let's define $T:L_2(0,\infty) \to L_2(0,\infty)$ as $$(Tf)(x) = \int_0^\infty \frac{f(y)\sqrt{xy}}{x^2y^2+1}dy.$$ I'm interested, if this operator is compact.
$T$ is integral operator with kernel $K = \frac{\sqrt{xy}}{x^2y^2+1}$. The Holder inequality, which gives the usual bound $\|Tf\|_{L_2}\leq \|K\|_{L_2}\cdot \|f\|_{L_2}$, is not working here, because $K \notin L^2((0,\infty)\times(0,\infty))$. But I tried to use Schur test, and succeed to find this bound: $||T|| \le {\pi}/{\sqrt2}$. Then I tried to prove that $T$ is not compact. Because $L_2(0,\infty)$ is reflexive space, $T$ is compact iff it's completely continuous. So I tried to prove that $T$ is not completely continuous, that is to find weakly convergent sequence $f_n$ for which $Tf_n$ is not norm-convergent. But I cannot find such a sequence. 
Any suggestions? Maybe $T$ compact, but how to prove it then?","['functional-analysis', 'compact-operators', 'integral-operators', 'operator-theory']"
2302612,"If a derivative is a linear transformation, and for a linear transformation $f$ at $a$, $f'(a) = f(a)$, why doesn't $f''(a) = f'(a)$?","Before this gets downvoted into oblivion, let me explain what I'm asking. There's a well known theorem that states the following If $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is a linear transformation, then $f' = f$, where $f'$ is the $m \times n $ matrix of partial derivatives of $f$ (i.e. $f'$ is the derivative of $f$ ) But we know that the derivative itself is a linear transformation $f' : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, so if we let $g = f'$, then $g' = f'$, and since $g'$ is the second derivative of $f$ (that being $f''$), does that not imply that all second derivatives (or any $n^{th}$ derivative) of any function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ equals the first derivative $f'$? This obviously cannot be the case, so there must be some error in my interpretation of this theorem. But I'm not sure what my error is. Also I apologize for asking such a silly question such as this.","['multivariable-calculus', 'definition', 'differential-geometry', 'derivatives']"
2302620,Derivative where the variable is a matrix,"In the context of Neural Nets, I'm trying to derivate the objective function with respect to the weight-matrices. I'm stuck at the following point: Let $N$ and $D$ two distinct integers, and $A\in\mathcal M_{N, D}(\mathbb R)$, $B\in\mathcal M_{D, N}(\mathbb R)$ two matrices. We'll also consider $\omega_A$ and $\omega_B$ two column-vectors of size $N$. At some point of the process, I must derivate the following quantity $q$ with respect to $B$ : $$
q = \omega_A^T\cdot A\cdot B\cdot\omega_B
$$ I know that $q$ has the dimension of a scalar and that $\frac{\partial q}{\partial B}$ should be some sort of matrix. But I just can't apply the classic formulas of scalar derivation and get $\frac{\partial q}{\partial B}=\omega_A^T\cdot A\cdot\omega_B$ because the dimensions don't match. How should I proceed? I've thought of rearranging the terms to match dimensions, such as: $$
\frac{\partial q}{\partial B}=\left(\omega_B\cdot\omega_A^T\cdot A\right)^T
$$ but I don't ""see"" why this should be correct. Besides, I don't know if this is of relevance here, but the two $\omega$ are ""One-Hot"" vectors, meaning they constist of one $1$ and $0$s everywhere else. This means $q$ can also be understood as the scalar product between a line of $A$ (given by $\omega_A$) and a column of $B$ (given by $\omega_B$). In this case, only one column of the matrix $\frac{\partial q}{\partial B}$ would be non-zero because $\omega_B\cdot\omega_A^T$ is a ""One-Hot"" matrix.""","['derivatives', 'matrices', 'partial-derivative', 'machine-learning', 'neural-networks']"

2302761,Proving Riemann's Theorem through Casorati- Weierstrass,"The title is pretty much self-explanatory; I'd like to know if there is a proof of Riemann's rearrangement theorem that uses the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem. Even if you're not familiar with such a proof but can come up with one, I'd like to have a look. To be specific: Riemann's Rearrangement Theorem Let $(a_n)\subset\mathbb{R}$ be a real valued sequence such that the series $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n}$ converges, but not absolutely, meaning that $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_n|=+\infty}$. Then, for every $c \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ there exists a rearrangement $k:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ such that $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{k(n)} = c}$. Comment: A rearrangement is just a bijection of the positive integers. Casorati-Weierstrass Theorem Let $z_0 \in \Omega$, with $\Omega$ being an open set and $f:\Omega\setminus\{z_0\}\to\mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function, such that $z_0$ is an essential singularity of $f$. Then, for each $\delta>0$ that satisfies $D(z_0,\delta)\subset\Omega$, the set$f(D(z_0,\delta)\setminus\{z_0\})$ is dense in $\mathbb{C}$. I'm familiar with the proofs of both theorems, but I can't seem to make a connection. I'm not even sure there is one; but both of the theorems flirt with the density of the limit points and I strongly believe that they're connected.","['complex-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'holomorphic-functions', 'sequences-and-series']"

Then we randomly uniformly pick point $y$ on a unit circle $\{x^2 + y^2 \leq 1\}$. Let $R$ be a rectangle with diagonal $xy$, which sides are parallel to coordinate axes.

2302790,Number of prefixes that match suffixes,"Consider all pairs of strings $A$ and $B$ each of length $n$ where $A_i, B_i \in \{0,1\}$.   We compare all the prefixes of $A$ with all the suffixes of $B$ of the same length and report where they match exactly. For example,  consider $A=01011$ and $B=11010$.  We have $0 = 0$, $01 \ne 10$, $010 = 010$, $0101 \ne 1010$ and $01011 \ne 11010$. For strings $A$ and $B$ we will report this sequence of matches and non-matches as a tuple of $1$s and $0$s where $1$ indicates a match and $0$ indicates a non-match.

2302823,Abel's Test for convergence proof,"I am working from ""Understanding Analysis"" by Abbot and the following is an exercise that works through the proof of Abel's Test. I reproduce the question and the solution. I am confused at a section of the proof towards the end. Any clarifications would be great. Abel's Test for convergence states that if the series
  $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_n$ converges, and if $(y_n)$ is a sequence
  satisfying $y_1 \ge y_2 \ge \cdots \ge 0$, then the series
  $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_ny_n$ converges. (a) Assume that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$ has partial sums that are
  bounded by a constant $A>0$ and assume $b_1 \ge b_2 \ge \cdots \ge 0$.
  Use summation by parts to show that $|\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_jb_j | \le
 2Ab_1$. Let $A>0$ be an upper bound for the partial sums $s_n$ of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$, hence
\begin{align}
|\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_jb_j | &= |s_n b_{n+1} - s_m b_{m+1} + \sum_{j=m+1}^{n} s_j(b_j-b_{j+1})|\le \\
& \le Ab_{n+1} + Ab_{m+1} + A(b_{m+1}-b_{n+1})= \\
& =2Ab_{m+1} \le 2Ab_1
\end{align} (b) Prove Abel's Test by setting $a_n = x_{m+n}$ and $b_n = y_{m+n}$. To show that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_ny_n$ converges, we use the Cauchy Criterion. Let $\epsilon > 0$, we need to show that there exists an $N$ such that if $n > m \ge N$, it follows that $|\sum_{j=m+1}^{n}x_jy_j|<\epsilon$. Let $a_n = x_{m+n}$ and $b_n = y_{m+n}$, then from part (a), we have
\begin{align}
|\sum_{j=m+1}^{n}x_jy_j| = |\sum_{j=1}^{n-m}a_jb_j| \le 2Ab_1,
\end{align}
where $A$ is an upper bound on the partial sums of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n=\sum_{j=m+1}^{\infty}x_j$. Since $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_n$ converges, then by the Cauchy Criterion, we can pick $N$ such that $n > m \ge N$ implies $|\sum_{j=m+1}^{n}x_j| < \frac{\epsilon}{2y_1}$. Up until this point, I clearly understand every step of the proof, but the following is when I get confused: Looking again at what the constant $A$ represents, it follows that if $n > m \ge N$, then 
\begin{align}
A \le |\sum_{j=m+1}^{n}x_j| < \frac{\epsilon}{2y_1}.
\end{align} How can the above be true? $A$ is the upper bound of the partial sum of the series $\sum_{j=m+1}^{\infty}x_j$, so by definition, we should have $|\sum_{j=m+1}^{n}x_j| \le A$ for all $n > m$. So, why is the above inequality $A \le |\sum_{j=m+1}^{n}x_j|$?",['real-analysis']

2303184,Proof the continuity of a function.,"Let $X$ be a compact and perfect subset of $\mathbb C$. Consider a sequence of sets $F_n \subset X$ such that $F_n \neq \emptyset$ is a clopen set of $X$ and $F_n \cap F_m = \emptyset, \, \forall n \neq m.$ Hence, there is $z_n \in F_n$ and, since $X$ is compact, exists a subsequence $z_{n_k} \to z_0 \in X$.
Since $F_{n_k}$ is open and $F_n \cap F_m = \emptyset, \, \forall n \neq m.$, we have that $z_0 \notin F_{n_k}, \, \forall k$. Define the following function: $$ f(z) = \left\{\begin{matrix}
z_{n_k}, z \in F_{n_k}
\\ 
z_0, z \in X\setminus \left ( \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb N} F_{n_k} \right )
\end{matrix}\right. $$ I'm trying to proof that $f$ is continuous in $X$. Take $z \in F_{n_k}$ for some $k$, as $F_{n_k}$ is an open set, exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $z$ such that $f_V = z_{n_k}$, hence $f$ is constant in $z$. Let's proof that $f$ is a continuous function in $z_0$. In fact, given $\epsilon > 0$, exists $k_0 \in \mathbb N$ s.t. $|z_{n_k} - z_0| < \epsilon, \, \forall k \geq k_0$. Since $V = B(z_0, \epsilon) \cup \left ( \bigcup_{k < k_0} X \setminus F_{n_k} \right )$ is an open set in $X$, exists $\delta > 0$ such that $B(z_0, \delta) \subset V$. Hence $$\forall z \in B(z_0, \delta), \, |f(z) - f(z_0)| \leq sup_{k \geq k_0} |z_{n_k} - z_0| < \epsilon$$ Then, we conclude that $f$ is continuous in $z_0$. However, I'm not getting to proof that $f$ is continuous in the other points of $\left ( \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb N} F_{n_k} \right )$.
If I take $z$ in such set, we'd have $$ |f(w) - f(z)| \leq |f(w) - f(z_0)| + |f(z_0) - f(z)| = |f(w) - f(z_0)|, $$ since $f(z_0) = f(z) = z_0$. My problem is in define an neighborhood $V$ of $z$ that makes $|f(w) - z_0| < \epsilon$. Help?","['continuity', 'complex-analysis']"

2303194,How can one translate between scheme-theoretic and complex-analytic Algebraic Geometry?,"The title is too broad. I will narrow it down shortly. My motivation is this. I am interested in complex geometry, and it seems there are (at least) 2 schools having their own notations, methods and so on, to study the same objects: scheme-theoretic (as in R. Hartshorne's ""Algebraic Geometry"") and complex-analytic (as in Griffiths and Harris's book). I understand that each has its own merits, and this is not really the point of my post. I am interested in some possible dictionary to translate results from one language to the other. Already there are differences on the level of topological spaces: schemes make use of the Zariski topology, while complex manifold theory uses the manifold topology. There are also differences between the structure sheaves: schemes, in the context of complex varieties, make use of sheaves that are sheaves of germs of regular rational functions, while in the complex analytic school, one uses the sheaf of germs of holomorphic functions as structure sheaf. Now, I will narrow it down. Consider say Grothendieck's vanishing theorem on one hand, and various vanishing theorems such as the Kodaira-Nakano vanishing theorems and its various generalizations. The conclusions are similar, namely some higher sheaf cohomologies vanish in both cases, but the hypotheses are different: Grothendieck uses Noetherian topological spaces (complex varieties are Noetherian with respect to the Zariski topology, and not the manifold topology), while Kodaira-Nakano use the manifold topology. Maybe my question is naive but: Question 1: can one deduce one of these vanishing theorems from the other? Question 2: are there other examples of theorems which have similar conclusions, but have 2 different versions corresponding to the 2 schools? Question 3: is there a dictionary that allows to translate statements of theorems from one school into the other, so to speak? Question 1 may be too naive, and perhaps false. Question 2 is perhaps not too specific, but interesting, in my opinion. Question 3 would be ultimately what I would like to ""have"", assuming such a dictionary exists. If it exists, it may not be so ""clean cut"" so to speak, because many of the definitions in the scheme-theoretic school were done essentially by algebraists, while those in the complex analytic school were mostly done by geometers and analysts. Edit: concerning question 1), as Bertram pointed out, the 2 vanishing theorems that I chose were quite different in character, so that was a poor choice. Concerning question 3), Bertram kindly referred me to Serre's GAGA paper, which establishes the dictionary I am seeking, and does it with precise results. I kept hearing about this paper as being a masterpiece. Now I have (finally) decided that it was time to read it!","['schemes', 'complex-manifolds', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

The gambling odds are how much reward I get after winning a bet. For example, if team A is projected by the house to have a much better chance of winning, they may set x=1.05, and y=7.5. If I bet \$1 on B and win, I get a net profit of \$7.5-\$1=\$6.5. If I bet \$1 on A or B and lose, then I get a net profit of -\$1. I can also choose to not bet for a net profit of \$0.

My attempt and more explanation (might contain error): By my understanding, $\bf x$ here should be treated as fixed. The first optimization is varying ${\bf a}_i$, and the second optimization is varying ${\bf p}_i$. I think the two optimizations are equivalent in the sense that $\max_{{\bf a}_i} {\bf a}_i^T{\bf x} =\min_{{\bf p}_i} {\bf p}^T_i{\bf d}_i$. It is easy to see ${\bf D}_i{\bf a}_i \le {\bf d}_i$ is equivalent to ${\bf p}_i^T{\bf D}_i{\bf a}_i \le {\bf p}_i^T{\bf d}_i, \forall {\bf p}_i \ge {\bf 0}$.

It is known that there's a good asymptotic formula for $p(N)$ large $N$ (in my application, $N$ is greater than a billion, so it's very good indeed): $$p(N)\approx \frac{1}{4N\sqrt3}e^{\pi \sqrt{\frac{2N}{3}}}$$ However, I'm not interested in finding the unrestricted partitions: I specifically want the number of partitions that do not repeat any number in the sum.  In the above example, the partitions I'd be interested in are $P_5^*=\{5,4+1,3+2\}$, and $|P^*_5| = p^*(5) =3$.

The notation correspondence between my function and the general one is $a=A^\rho B$ and $b=1-\rho$. Say you want to find $$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{d f(x)}{d x}  = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} a \left(\frac{f(x)}{x}\right)^b$$ Because of the assumption $f(0)=0$, this derivative has an undefined expression inside the parenthesis, $\frac{0}{0}$.

In other words, we are in an infinite L'Hopital loop. How can we get around it? Apparently the answer to this limit is $0$, but I fail to see who this is achieved.

2304261,Understanding curvature as rate of change of angle between neighbouring tangents,"When introducing the concept of curvature in ""Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces"", do Carmo makes the statement the norm $|\alpha''(s)|$ of the second derivative measure the rate of change of the angle which neighbouring tangents make with the tangent at $s$. Here $\alpha(s)$ is a curve parametrized by arc length. I have read similar things elsewhere, e.g. Wikipedia states the curvature of a plane curve at any point is the limiting ratio of $d\theta$, an infinitesimal angle (in radians) between tangents to that curve at the ends of an infinitesimal segment of the curve, to the length of that segment $ds$, i.e., $d\theta/ds$. If the tangents at the ends of the segment are represented by unit vectors, it is easy to show that in this limit, the magnitude of the difference vector is equal to $d\theta$, which leads to the given expression in the second definition of curvature. Accompanying this is the following potentially useful diagram: I cannot understand how to make this interpretation rigorous. In particular, interpreting do Carmo at face value, if we define $\theta_{s_0}(s)$ to be the angle between $\alpha'(s)$ and $\alpha'(s_0)$ for some fixed $s_0$, then $$\theta_{s_0}(s) = \arccos\left[\alpha'(s) \cdot \alpha'(s_0)\right]$$ (since $||\alpha'(s)|| = 1$). However, this has derivative $$\theta_{s_0}'(s) = -\frac{\alpha'(s_0) \cdot \alpha''(s)}{\sqrt{1 - (\alpha'(s) \cdot \alpha'(s_0))^2}},$$ which I do not believe is equal to $||\alpha''(s_0)||$.

We also know that 10% of students are younger than 18.3 years. What are the mean and standard deviation of the ages? In my attempts to solve a similar problem I can't see how to calculate the mean or standard deviation without first knowing one of the two. I can find the z-score for 95% and 10%, and if I could somehow derive the values for 5% or 90% I could then average the 5% and 95% or 10% and 90% values to then find the mean, but I don't see a way to do so. Is it even possible to solve this problem or is there not enough information?","['means', 'statistics', 'standard-deviation', 'normal-distribution']"
2304289,proving that every set of zero Lebesgue outer measure is measurable,"According to Terence Tao's Introduction to Measure Theory , a set $E \subset \mathbb R^d$ is said to be Lebesgue measurable if, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an open set $U \subset \mathbb R^d$ containing $E$ such that $m^*(U\setminus E)\le \epsilon$.  Using this definition, I was able to show that every set $E$ with $m^*(E)=0$ was measurable.  Although the proof isn't very long, I wonder if there's a simpler way to see this than the arguments I used, as shown below: Suppose $m^*(E)=0$. Then for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a countable union of boxes, $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n$, containing $E$, with $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |B_n|<\epsilon$.  For each $B_n$, we then find an open box $C_n \supset B_n$ with volumn $|C_n| \le |B_n|+\frac{\epsilon}{2^n}$.  As a result, $U \triangleq \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} C_n$ is an open set containing $E$ with $m^*(U)\le\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |C_n|\le \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(|B_n|+\frac{\epsilon}{2^n}\right)<2\epsilon$.  Clearly, $m^*(U\setminus E) \le m^*(U)$, so $E$ is measurable. Is this proof correct?  Is there a more straightforward way to see it?  Thanks a lot! EDIT: This question is related to Are all measure zero sets measurable? , with the differences being (1) the definition of measurability is different, (2) this question is more general; it's about $\mathbb R^d$ instead of $\mathbb R$, (3) I want to verify a proof with these differences.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

To solve this problem, I'm trying to apply technique described in Chapter 14.5 of Artin's book (2nd edition). In general, given any ring $R$, a presentation matrix for an $R$-module $V$ is a matrix $A$ such that $R^m/AR^n\rightarrow V$ is an isomorphism; here $AR^n$ stands for the image of the map $R^n\rightarrow R^m$ given by left multiplication by $A$. If $R=\mathbb{Z}$ and we know such a matrix $A$, then we can determine the structure of the abelian group $V$ by diagonalizing $A$ via row and column operations. Now the situation in question is converse. As far as I understand, I am given a presentation matrix for the $\mathbb{Z}$-module $\mathbb{Z}^2/H$, which is, in the above terminology, $$A=\begin{bmatrix}15&0 & 0\\0&12 & 0 \\ 0&0&10\end{bmatrix}.$$
Also, in the above terminology, $R=\mathbb{Z}$, $V=\mathbb{Z}^2/H$, and $m=2$. I need to find $n$ and $A\mathbb{Z}^n$ (the latter will be the answer). But the matrix $A$ is $3\times 3$ and it does not contain $e_j$ as one of its colums or the zero column, so its size cannot be changed (I mean if it contained the zero column, we could have deleted this column). And such a matrix only determines a homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}^3\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^3$. But we need a homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^2$ for some $n$.

1&1&0&0&0&0&0&0\\
1&0&0&0&0&0&0&1\\
\end{pmatrix}$$ I denote the characteristic polynomial of $A(n)$ by $\chi_{A(n)}(X)$. So for example $$\chi_{A(8)}(X)=X^8-3X^7-5X^6+19X^5+2X^4-31X^3+X^2+10X-3$$ I use the standard notation $\varphi$ to denote the golden ratio and it is equal to ${1+\sqrt{5}\above 1.5pt 2}$. The ""Golden Conjugate"" is written as $-{1\above 1.5 pt \varphi}$ and is equal to ${1-\sqrt{5}\above 1.5pt 2}$. I use $\lambda$ to denote an eigenvalue of $\chi_{A(n)}(X)$. In the example above the characteristic polynomial $\chi_{A(8)}(X)$ has two eigenvalues $\lambda_1=-{1\above 1.5 pt \varphi}$ and $\lambda_2=\varphi$. In particular $\chi_{A(8)}(X)$ has exactly two roots: one equal to the golden ratio and the other equal to the golden conjugate. Below is a tabulation of data for small values of $n$.

2304625,On the arithmetic differential equation $n''=n'$,"If $n'$ denotes the arithmetic derivative of non-negative integer $n$, and $n''=(n')'$, then solve the following equation $$n''=n'.$$ What I have found, you can read in one minute! I have tried to explain it very detailed so anyone, even with a little knowledge of elementary number theory (like me), can follow the steps. $n=0$ and $n=1$ are solutions. It is known that for a natural number $n>1$ with prime factorization of $\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{a_i}$ arithmetic derivative is $$n'=n \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{a_i}{p_i}. \tag{1}$$ Let $m=n'$, then equation becomes $m'=m$. Let prime factorization of $m$ be $\prod_{j=1}^{l} q_j^{b_j}$. Then from equation $(1)$ we get $$\frac{b_1}{q_1}+ \frac{b_2}{q_2}+... + \frac{b_l}{q_l}=1. \tag{2}$$ This equation implies that $q_j \ge b_j$. Multiply both sides of the equation $(2)$ by $q_1 q_2 ... q_{l-1}$. It follows that $q_1 q_2 ... q_{l-1}\frac{b_l}{q_l}$ is an integer. Thus $q_l | b_l$. Hence $b_l \ge q_l$ and $b_l=q_l$. Subsequently $b_1=b_2=...=b_{l-1}=0$ and $m=q^q$ for some prime number $q$. Thus we have $n'=m=q^q$ and $n\sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{a_i}{p_i}=q^q$ or $$\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{a_i-1}\sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( p_1 p_2 ... p_k \frac{a_i}{p_i} \right)=q^q. \tag{3}$$ Notice that if $p_i \neq q$ is a prime divisor of $n$, then $a_i=1$. We claim that if $q$ is a prime divisor of $n$, then its the only one. If $q \mid n$ then $n$ is in the form $$n=p_1p_2...p_kq^a,$$ Where $\gcd(q, p_i)=1$. Now its easy to see from equation $(3)$ that $a \le q$ and dividing both sides of it by $q^{a-1}$ gives $$q\sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{p_1 p_2 ... p_k}{p_i} \right)+p_1 p_2 ... p_k a=q^{q-a+1}.$$Therefore, $q|a$, which leads to $a \ge q$ and $q=a$. Thus $$\sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{p_1 p_2 ... p_k}{p_i} \right)+p_1 p_2 ... p_k=1,$$Which is a contradiction and $n=q^q$. Thus $n=q^q$ is a solution to the original equation, where $q$ is a prime number. If $q \nmid n$, then equation $(3)$ gives $$\sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{p_1 p_2 ... p_k}{p_i} \right)=q^q,$$Where I am stuck with.

2304714,"In a ring, are cosets always additive?","In our introductory course on groups, we defined cosets and quotient groups in the following way. Let $N\trianglelefteq G$ be a normal subgroup of a group $(G,\,\cdot\,)$. Then the quotient group $G/N$ contains all the cosets of $N$ with respect to the elements of $G$, i.e. $G/N=\{Ng:g\in G\}$. Later on, we generalised this idea to rings: Let $I$ be an ideal of a ring $(R, +, \,\cdot\,)$. Then the quotient ring $R/I$ is defined $R/I = \{I+r:r\in R\}$. My question is: why do we take the `additive' cosets of $R$ in this case? i.e. does $R/I$ always contain cosets of the form $I+r$, and not $I\cdot r$? I reasoned that perhaps we take the $+$ cosets since $(R,+)$ forms a group, but $(R,\,\cdot\,)$ does not. But what if we have a field?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"
2304727,"""Rectangularity"" of integers","We can sort of think of a number $n$ as ""almost square"" if $n = kl$ where $$\frac{k}{l} \approx 1.$$ More generally, we can talk about the ""rectangularity"" of an integer $n$ as
$$
\max_{k \leq l | kl = n} \frac{k}{l}.
$$
(We might also look at the inverse of that number and call it the​ ""eccentricity."" We also might somehow look at the eccentricity for more than 2 factors.) Then the ""most rectangular"" numbers, the squares, have rectangularity 1, and the ""least rectangular"" numbers, the primes, have rectangularity 1/p. Some questions are naturally suggested. Does the expected rectangularity of a number go to 1 as $n \rightarrow \infty$? How fast does it grow? What does the probability density function of different rectangularities for $n$ look like, as a function of the size of $n$? What about over the p-adics? What is known about this property? Has it been investigated? Does it have a real name?","['number-theory', 'integers']"
2304744,About numbers which have very few little divisors,"I will provide some context first, you can skip directly to the question down there if you are in a hurry. Context. I am interested in numbers which have very few little divisors.
Let's denote by $\mathbb P$ the set of all prime numbers.
I was searching for numbers $n$ which satisfies: $$\forall p\in \mathbb P,\quad p\leqslant \sqrt n\implies n\equiv 1\pmod p.$$ We can prove that this condition will be impossible to satisfy for $n\geqslant 32$ . So I started to search for numbers satisfying: $$\forall p\in \mathbb P,\quad p\leqslant \log n\implies n\equiv 1\pmod p.$$ If found a bunch of them: $$2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,31,37\ldots,8191,8821,9241,9661,9871\ldots$$ But again, since $$\prod_{\substack p\in\mathbb P\\p\leqslant n} p \sim n^ne^n$$ I saw that this list will eventually end, which can be illustrated by these two lines crossing: This is to avoid all these issues that I have chosen the following definition (to give chance to this list not to stop in particular). At first, I tried to find an optimal condition, but it would end with finding a function $\phi$ such that $$\Gamma\left(\frac{\phi(n)}{\log\phi(n)}\right)e^{\frac{\phi(n)}{\log\phi(n)}\log\log\frac{\phi(n)}{\log\phi(n)}-\mathrm{Li}\left(\frac{\phi(n)}{\log\phi(n)}\right)}\leqslant n$$ for all $n$ , which seemed impossible to solve. The question. Let's define a harsh number as a number $n$ such that $$\forall p\in \mathbb P,\quad F (p)\leqslant n\implies n\equiv 1\pmod p$$ where $$F(x)=\prod_{\substack p\in\mathbb P\\p\leqslant x} p.$$ We can find the first harsh numbers up to $10^8$ : $$1,3,5,7,13,19,\ldots,6931,9241,11551,\ldots,60061,90091,120121,\ldots,510511,1021021,1531531,\ldots,9189181,9699691,\ldots$$ Does there exist infinitely many harsh numbers? (I think it does) Can we find a formula wich would give the $n$ -th harsh number?","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'arithmetic']"
2304761,well-defined sections of twisted sheaf,"Let us consider the twisting sheaf of Serre, $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ where $X=\operatorname{Proj} k[x_0, \dots,x_n]$. We define $$ \mathcal{O}_X (1) = k[x_0, \dots, x_n](1)^{\sim} $$ Then for some homogeneous $f$ of degree $m$ $$\mathcal{O}_X(1)_{D(f)}= k[x_0,\dots, x_n](1)_f = \{\frac{x}{f^k} \vert x \in k[x_0, \dots, x_n]_{km+1} \}$$ Thus the difference in degree in the fractions is $1$. My problem with this is the following: For the original description of the structure sheaf of $\operatorname{Proj}$ it was it was important that our fractions were of degree zero. I thought we do this because when we consider projective space, for example, we want these sections to be well defined. 
However, with the description as above, our local sections would cease being well-defined. Is this now ok or what am I not understanding?",['algebraic-geometry']
2304762,How to see this result of restricting and pushing forward a sheaf?,"Let $X$ be a complex variety with trivial canonical bundle $K_B=\mathcal{O}_X$, with a projection morphism $f$ onto a complex codimension one subspace $s$. Consider the sheaf
$$
\mathcal{F} := f_*\left(\mathcal{O}_X(ns) \otimes \mathcal{O}_s\right) \, ,
$$
where $n$ is a positive integer, $\mathcal{O}_X(ns)$ is the sheaf of meromorphic functions with divisor greater than $-ns$, and $f_*$ is the pushforward map. I have seen it stated without justification that $\mathcal{F}=K_s^{\otimes n}$, where $K_s$ is the canonical bundle of $s$. What I would like to see is a derivation of this result that explicitly uses the definitions of pushforwards and the sheaves $\mathcal{O}_X(ns)$ and $\mathcal{O}_s$. Note: I have edited the post to say $\mathcal{O}_X(ns) \otimes \mathcal{O}_s$ instead of $\mathcal{O}_X(ns)|_s$. The latter notation is used in the reference where the result is stated, but seems to be an abuse of notation. Thanks to user347489 for pointing this out.","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
2304769,Is an infinite field always isomorphic to a non-trivial fraction field?,"Out of the blue, I asked myself the following question: Is an infinite field always isomorphic to the fraction field of an integral domain which is itself not a field? Please note that the above setup avoid answering by a field is its own fraction field . I think this question is natural as it is kind of a converse to the following: Proposition. The rings which can be embedded into some field are exactly the integral domains. As fraction fields have no characteristic properties that I am aware of, I am lost on how to tackle this problem. Any enlightenment will be greatly appreciated! Edit 1. My question only involves infinite field as a finite integral domain is itself a field and the result failed to be true in this case. - pointed out by carmichael561 in the comments below. Edit 2. The result holds for field of characteristic zero . - link provided by Arthur . As for now, the interesting question is the following: Is an infinite field of prime characteristic isomorphic to a non-trivial fraction field?","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory', 'integral-domain']"

2304783,Can a function return itself or take itself as an argument?,"I'm curious whether a function can take itself as an argument or return itself. That is to say: Is there a function $f$ such that $f() = f$? Or perhaps less confusingly if you aren't used to functions which don't take arguments: Is there a function $f$ and an object $x$ such that $f(x) = f$? To make it even more clear: This would imply that $(f(x))(x) = f(x) = f$. Please don't confuse this with something like $\text{id}(\text{id}(5))$. What's happening here is that the outer (call to the)* identity function takes the result of the inner (call to the)* identity function as an argument, not the identity function itself. * I have no idea how mathematicians would say this. Too much computer science, too little math. ;-) Would be nice if you dropped this in, though, so that I can learn about mathematical terminology.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"
