61424,Largest value of $p$ such that $f \in L^p$,"Let $X$ be a measure space of finite total measure and suppose that $f \in L^1(X)$. I know that since $\mu(X) < \infty$, $f\in L^p$ implies that $f \in L^q$ for all $q \leq p$. I am interested in $p = \sup\{r\in [1,\infty) : f\in L^r\}$.

61433,"How do these two contorted functions, $F(x)(f)=f(x)$ and $\mathscr{F}(f)=(x\mapsto (t\mapsto f(t)(x)))$, work?","First off: I haven't taken a functional analysis course yet, so please keep that in mind when explaining. I just rather randomly read about this stuff and it started to interest me. I'm having trouble understanding how the following contorted mappings work. I don't want any more details than necessary; just the plane explanation which functions they take to which space and why it makes sense to define the mapping in the way they are defined (maybe like a diagram in words) and so on. 1) In this Wikipedia article it was mentioned, that there is a natural map $F$ from a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ to $V''$ (the dual of the dual, meaning the space of all linear functionals that take themselves linear functionals as  arguments and return values from $F$, if I understood it correctly ), by $F(x)(f)=f(x)$. (The notation $F(x)(f)$ would imply that $F(x)$ is itself a function taking as an argument another function $f$. But what would be the domain and range of this $f$ ? And why does it make sense to assign the value of $F(x)(f)$ the value of $f$ at $x$) 2) Similar question (maybe more difficult), to be found in these lecture notes ,page 61 bottom: Let $I$ be compact and $E,F$  Banach spaces and consider the mapping $\mathscr{F}:C(I,L(E,F)) \rightarrow L(E,C(I,F))$ defined by $\mathscr{F}(f)=(x\mapsto (t\mapsto f(t)(x)))$. Now I understand that to $f$ there is a map associated, lets call it $\mathscr{G}:E \rightarrow C(I,F)$, such that  $\mathscr{G} (x)$ is a continuous map from $I$ to $F$, $t\mapsto f(t)(x)$. But what I don't understand is, why the author says this mapping simulates the change of variables.If it did, why did the constraints to work in the space of continuous respectively linear maps had to be imposed?  And  does why this (latest) mapping from  $I$ to $F$ takes the value $f(t)(x)$ ?",['functions']

61460,Calculate expectation from empirical cdf,"I have a empirical cumulative probability distribution function for a random variable. The random variable is ""time to failure"" and I have the full curve i.e till the probability reaches $1$. I want to know Mean Time To Failure i.e expectation of that random variable. Is there any standard method to find mean from an empirical distribution. I am getting the empirical CDF (as discrete values) as output from a ""model checking tool"" which uses iterative numerical computation techniques to get those probabilities. For example, let $F(t)=P(X \leq t)$ is the CDF of the random variable $X$ where $X$ stands for time between failure. To plot the curve of ""$F(t)$ vs $t$"" I am varying t with some step size, calculating $F(t)$ for that t using the ""model checking tool"" and adding the points to get the curve. I can use small step size to get the more accurate curve. So, I have access to only this CDF values at different$ t$. From this values I want to do a good estimate of mean value of $X$. Now the parameters will be: 1) $T$, the maximum value of t. We need to find this 
with some precision i.e if $F(T_1)-F(T_2)$ is less than some epsilon we set $T=T_1$. 2) Once we have found T we need to find suitable step size $h$ at which we will be
calculating the CDF values. How should I choose those parametrs?","['probability-distributions', 'probability']"

61509,Bounded linear operators that commute with translation,"I'm trying to read Elias Stein's ""Singular Integrals"" book, and in the beginning of the second chapter, he states two results classifying bounded linear operators that commute (on $L^1$ and $L^2$ respectively). The first one reads: Let $T: L^1(\mathbb{R}^n) \to L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be a bounded linear transformation. Then $T$ commutes with translations if and only if there exists a measure $\mu$ in the dual of $C_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$ (continuous functions vanishing at infinity), s.t. $T(f) = f \ast \mu$ for every $f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$. It is also true that $\|T\|=\|\mu\|$. The second one says: Let $T:L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) \to L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be bounded and linear. Then $T$ commutes with translation if and only if there exists a bounded measurable function $m(y)$ so that $(T\hat{f})(y) = m(y) \hat{f}(y)$ for all $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$. It is also true that $\|T\|=\|m\|_\infty$. I was wondering if anyone had a reference to a proof of these two results or could explain why they are true.","['harmonic-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

61547,Rotation of a vector distribution to align with a normal vector,I generate a distribution of random points on a unit hemisphere whose pole is on the positive z-axis (the base lies in the x-y plane). Each point represents a directional vector $v$ in which a ray will be fired. I wish to rotate this distribution of points to align the 'hemisphere' with a vector which is the surface normal vector ($V_n$) of a given surface. Currently I complete this by converting the cartesian coordinates of $N$ to spherical coordinates as follows: $\theta = \arctan(N_y/N_x)$ $\phi = \arccos(N_z)$ I then form a rotation matrix for rotating around the z and x axis and use it to transform the original vector $v$ to get my desired vector $v'$. $v'$ will now lie on a hemisphere which is aligned with the surface normal $N$. Is there a better way to complete this operation without having to calculate the spherical coordinates of the normal vector then compose a rotation matrix and preform a matrix multiplication. This function is used in a tight loop of some computationally expensive code so it would be ideal to preform some fundamental optimisation. Perhaps some properties of vectors could be used it would be most beneficial if I could avoid having to calculate $\arccos$ and $\arctan$.,"['geometry', 'linear-algebra']"

61743,Is it possible to deduce a model for hyperbolic geometry from a synthetic set of axioms a la Euclid/Hilbert/Tarski?,"Motivation I learned from Emil Artin's book Geometric Algebra that the standard incidence axioms of affine geometry (two points determine a unique line, parallel postulate, no three collinear points exist) together with (specializations of) Desargues' theorem are sufficient to translate theories of affine geometries into theories of modules over division rings. Artin carries out explicitly the attractive construction of defining an appropriate notion of translation (a map $\tau$ with no fixed points such that the line $PQ$ determined b $P$ and $Q$ is parallel to the line$\tau(P)\tau(Q)$ determined by $\tau(P)$ and $\tau(Q)$), showing that the translations form an abelian group, and then showing that the endomorphisms of this group that fix the directions of the translations (i.e. that fix the pencil of parallel lines determined by any/each of the lines $P\tau(P)$) actually form a division ring. Intuitively, the elements of this division ring are the scalars by which translations are scaled. Then the abelian group of translations turns out to be a 2-dimensional module, and since part of Desargues' theorem states that there exist translations between any two points, this successfully coordinatizes the affine geometry. If I have understood correctly, adding an ordering to the geometry translates into an ordering on the underlying division ring (hence making it a subfield of $\mathbb R$); distance translates into a norm on the module; angles translate into an inner product, so the above successfully models Euclidean geometry (keeping in mind the choice of the three non-collinear points: $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$) as $\mathbb R^2$. The question My understanding of why what Artin does actually works is that the properties of translations crucially depend on the ""flatness"" of affine space, which is encoded by the parallel postulate (the parallel postulate seems to allow a kind of transport of incidence data around one point to another, it seems, and Desargues's theorem as used by Artin guarantees that all such transports are coherent with one another). Clearly, this is not true with hyperbolic geometry as it negates the parallel postulate. Nevertheless, I've read on numerous wikipedia pages that this negation is the only difference between the standard axioms of (plane) Euclidean geometry and (plane) Hyperbolic geometry. What I am curious about is whether it is possible to determine from primitive synthetic notions (points, lines, betweenness, congruence) the fact that hyperbolic geometry is a 2-dimensional Riemann surface manifold with constant negative curvature using a construction similar to the one I've read in Artin's book. Obviously, such a construction will be more sophisticated, as it would have to essentially select a coordinate chart around every point, together with transition maps (Artin's construction seems to construct one global chart for the whole of affine space). Any references, explanations, or corrections would be much appreciated. I should perhaps mention that my nebulous endgoal is to understand hyperbolic distance, but I believe this approach, if feasible, ought to shed much intuition about (plane) hyperbolic geometry.","['hyperbolic-geometry', 'geometry', 'reference-request']"

The array will typically be much longer and I'll want to compute much higher orders.",['algebra-precalculus']
61972,Counting fractions with $n$ digits in the numerator and denominator,"Playing around with fractions, I eventually had to consider the following question: Is there a formula for counting how many proper fractions in lowest terms with
  $n$ base-$b$ digits in both the numerator and the denominator are there? So, for instance, things like $0$, $\frac24$, $\frac22$, and $\frac43$ don't count. My first thought was that they'd be related to triangular numbers, but this seems to count the fractions not in lowest terms as well. I presume the final formula can be expressed as a triangular number minus some correction, but I can't figure out what that correction term ought to be.

-1 cancels the 1 from cos 0 so I get 0/0 then I can use l'Hôpital's rule. Having a = 0 I can use it again. Is this approach right?","['calculus', 'limits']"

62037,Computing complex principal value integral - sgn-function?,"I currently face a less appealing integral which emerged computing the expectation of some random variable. It reads as (omitting all unnecessary constants except $\alpha\in(0,1)$) $$ PV \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\exp[1-\exp[iu-|u|^\alpha(1-i\text{sgn}(u)]]}{u}du.$$ It converges as a principal value integral. However, I really have to compute it. Numerically this is not a trivial task, because it does not satisfy the Hoelder condition around zero. First thought: Contour integration. Could I replace $\text{sgn}(u)$ with $\frac{u}{|u|}\mathbb{1}_{u\neq 0}$? Due to the $\text{sgn}$-function we don't have a simple pole: $z\frac{\exp[1-\exp[iz-|z|^\alpha(1-i\frac{z}{|z|}\mathbb{1}_{z\neq 0}]]}{z}$ is not holomorphic in zero. Computing the residue will be a pain, I guess. What is the best way to attack this problem? Idea:
Compute $a_{-1} = \int_{\gamma}f(z)dz$, where $\gamma$ is a suitable contour and use series expansion of the exponential function. Or is it possible to obtain the Laurent series?

62053,Equivalent definitions of unconditional convergence,"I am across two definitions for unconditional convergence for which it is not immediately obvious to me that they are equivalent. Here are the definitions. Throughout, $\frak{X}$ will denote a Banach space. Definition 1.

Definition 2. A series $\sum x_n$ in $\frak{X}$ is said to converge unconditionally to $x$ if for any permutation $\sigma:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$, the series $\sum x_{\sigma(n)}$ converges to $x$.

62086,When should the antiderivative of a rational function be defined as a piecewise function?,"I'm doing basic problems on antiderivatives and there seems to be an inconsistency in my book. The instructions for these problems are: Find the most general antiderivative of the function. Number 11 is: 11. $f(x) = \dfrac{10}{x^9}$ So, I naturally wrote down $F(x) = -\dfrac{5}{4x^8} + C$. The solution manual says this is wrong.  The function has domain $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)$, so $F(x) = \begin{cases} -\dfrac{5}{4x^8}+C_1 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
-\dfrac{5}{4x^8}+C_2 & \text{if } x > 0 \end{cases}$ Okay, I thought.  That makes sense. I then come to number 13, which is: 13. $f(x) = \dfrac{u^4 + 3\sqrt{u}}{u^2}$. I figured the domain is $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)$, so I wrote down $F(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{3}u^3-6u^{-1/2}+C_1 & \text{if } u > 0 \\
\frac{1}{3}u^3-6u^{-1/2}+C_2 & \text{if } u < 0 \end{cases}$. Well, the solution book doesn't mention the domain and just says $F(x) = \frac{1}{3}u^3-6u^{-1/2}+C$. I later realized that the $\sqrt{u}$ in the numerator and the $u^2$ in the denominator must limit the domain to the positive numbers, so the antiderivative doesn't need to be defined for anything but positive numbers.  So, okay, I think I get it. Next number 19 is: 19. $f(x) = \dfrac{x^5-x^3+2x}{x^4} = x - \dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{2}{x^3}$ So, again, since the domain appears to be $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)$, I wrote down $F(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \ln|x| - \dfrac{1}{x^2} + C_1 & \text{if } x > 0 \\
\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \ln|x| - \dfrac{1}{x^2} + C_2 & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}$. But the book again doesn't mention the domain and just says that $F(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \ln|x| - \dfrac{1}{x^2} + C$. I am confused.  This doesn't seem consistent, especially between #11 and #19.  Why is my answer not right for #19?",['calculus']
62087,Least upper bound property iff convergence of Cauchy sequences,"From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Archimedean_ordered_field : The field of rational functions over $\mathbb{R}$ can be used to
  construct an ordered field which is complete (in the sense of
  convergence of Cauchy sequences) but is not the real numbers.
  Sometimes the term complete is used to mean that the least upper bound
  property holds. With this meaning of complete there are no complete
  non-Archemedian ordered fields. The subtle distinction between these
  two uses of the word complete is occasionally a source of confusion. I had the idea that, in an ordered field, completeness in the sense of convergence of Cauchy sequences is equivalent to convergence in the sense that the least upper bound property holds. Now that I think about it, I know how to prove that the least upper bound property implies the convergence of Cauchy sequences, but I'm not so sure about the converse. According to this Wikipedia page, the converse is not true. Can anyone confirm this? (I need to be sure this is not an error on Wikipedia) If possible, provide a counter-example (perhaps the field of rational functions suggested in the quote, but how is the structure, i.e., ordering, operations, etc., defined?).

62127,Strong topology vs Natural topology,"Let $X$ be a locally convex space and $\left< X, X^{\prime} \right>$ stands for the dual pair. The bidual of $X$ is denoted by $X^{\prime \prime}$ and this is a dual of $X^{\prime}$
with a strong topology $\beta(X^{\prime}, X)$, i.e. a topology on $X^{\prime}$ of uniform convergence on all bounded subsets of $X$ (determined by a family of seminorms $p_B(f)= \sup_{x \in B} |f(x)|$, where $B$ is a closed bounded absolutely convex subset of $X$).
We can consider the natural topology on the bidual $X^{\prime \prime}$, i.e. the topology of uniform convergence on the equicontinuous subsets of $X^{\prime}$, denoted by $\tau_N(X^{\prime \prime}, X^{\prime})$. The natural topology on $X$ concides with the original topology on $X$.

$A : (X^{\prime \prime}, \tau_N(X^{\prime \prime}, X^{\prime})) \rightarrow (Y^{\prime \prime}, \tau_N(Y^{\prime \prime}, Y^{\prime}))$ is also continuous?
