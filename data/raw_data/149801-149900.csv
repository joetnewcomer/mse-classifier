2486535,Calculate shortest distance between random point and line,"Considering the following situation: The red dot is located at $(0,0)$ and the blue dot is at $(0,-2)$. A black line is crossing the red dot and is rotated at $\alpha = 45°$ relative to the red dot. With this information, how can I find the length of the yellow dashed line? My first intuition is to calculate the distance $d$ between the two dots using: $$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$ The next step should be to calculate the distance between red dot and the point where the black line and yellow dashed line cross. But I can't seem to find how to do that, and even then, I am not sure of what to do next. The problem gets worse since the methodology to find the distance of the yellow dashed line should work for different cases in which the blue dot can be located somewhere else. For example, the following image has the situation in which the black line is still rotated at $\alpha = 45°$, the red dot is still at $(0,0)$ but the blue dot is located at $(-1,-2)$ The ultimate goal is to find a methodology that enables calculating the length of the yellow dashed line for any location of the blue dot but also any degree of rotation of the black line knowing that the red dot will always be at $(0,0)$. An example of such situation is shown on the picture under: Here the red dot is still at $(0,0)$, the blue dot is at $(-2,-2)$ but the black line is rotated by $\alpha = 60°$ relative to the red dot. Is it even possible to achieve this?",['geometry']
2486559,How is tanθ in this equation not equal 1/2,"I have been practicing a lot of pre-calculus equations, and currently, I am studying ""Trigonometry"" I have stumbled across this following question: If $\tan(2\theta) = \frac{4}{3}$, $\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \pi$, Find $\tan\theta$. I have first got the formula of $\tan(2\theta)$ and equaled it to $\frac{4}{3}$, then I got solving until I was left with: $$(2\tan\theta - 1)(\tan\theta + 2) = 0$$ So that means that $\tan\theta = \frac{1}{2}$, $\tan\theta = -2$.

2486561,Prove that $\cos (n \arccos (x))$ is a polynomial of $n$-th degree,"So, we got an assignment from the mathematical analysis class to prove that $\cos (n \arccos (x))$ is a polynomial of $n$th degree. I tried to prove it with mathematical induction and so far what I got is: basis :- $T(1) - \cos (1\cdot\arccos (x)) = \cos(\arccos(x)) = x$ Inductive step : $T(n+1)$ - assume it holds for $T(n)$, then it must hold for $T(n+1)$ $$\begin{align}\cos[(n+1) \arccos(x)] = &\cos[n \arccos(x) + \arccos(x)] &\\= 
&\cos[n \arccos(x)] \cos[\arccos(x)] - \sin[n \arccos(x)] \sin[\arccos(x)] 
&\\=& \cos[n\arccos(x)] x - \sin[n \arccos(x)] \sin[\arccos(x)]\end{align}$$ and this is where I got stuck because I don't know what to do with the sine part. like, I get that the $x\cos(n \arccos(x))$ holds because, by inductive step, it holds that $\cos(n\arccos(x))$ is the polynomial of nth degree, so $x\cos(n \arccos(x))$ is polynomial of $(n+1)$th degree. But I don't know if this is enough to prove this or if I need to do something with the sine too.","['induction', 'analysis']"

2486706,How do I show that formal logarithm is the inverse of the formal exponential?,"Let $A$ be a unital commutative and associative $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra. Define $exp(f):=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^n}{n!}$ for each $f\in XA[[X]]$. Define $log(f):=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} (f-1)^n$ for each $f\in 1+XA[[X]]$. Hence, we have two maps $exp:XA[[X]]\rightarrow 1+XA[[X]]$ and $log:1+XA[[X]]\rightarrow XA[[X]]$. I am trying to prove that $log$ map is the inverse of the $exp$ map. The first thing I tried is to directly show $log\circ exp=id$ and $exp\circ log = id$ by checking if the identities hold for every element $f$, but this does not work well since this way involves too many calculations. For example, $$[X^n]exp(log(f))=[X^n]\sum_{k=0}^n log(f)^k/k! = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k!} [X^n]log(f)^k= \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k!} [X^n](\sum_{l=1}^k \frac{(-1)^{l+1}}{l} (f-1)^l)^k$$. Thus, we have to show that $$\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k!} [X^n](\sum_{l=1}^k \frac{(-1)^{l+1}}{l} (f-1)^l)^k=[X^n]f$$. But this calculation is really a nightmare.. Is there a clever way to show this?

2486922,Integration on manifold using the flow of a vector field,"In a Physics paper the author states without proof something that seemed quite strange to me. The paper is on General Relativity, so he assumes a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$ is given. His hypothesis are: Suppose $f$ is a continuous scalar function on $M$ whose support $W$ extends to past and future infinity but which is bounded in spacelike directions, and take $L$, parametrized as $\gamma(s)$ by the proper time $s$ along it, to be a timelike worldline representing an observer. We shall now take $\Sigma(s)$ to be an arbitrary spacelike hypersurface through $\gamma(s)$ which depends continuously on $s$. Then if $w^\alpha$ is a vector field such that displacement of every point by $w^\alpha ds$ maps $\Sigma(s)$ into $\Sigma(s+ds)$ for each $s$, we have
  $$\langle f,\phi\rangle=\int ds \int_{\Sigma(s)} f\phi \sqrt{-g}w^\alpha n_\alpha d\Sigma,$$
  for all compactly supported $\phi\in C^\infty_0(M)$ being $n^\alpha$ the normal to $\Sigma(s)$. I believe that it all boils down to this: given a one-parameter family of spacelike hypersurfaces $\Sigma(s)$, and a vector field $W$ such that its flow satisfies $\Phi^X_\delta(\Sigma(s))=\Sigma(s+\delta)$, we have $$\int_M f(x) d^nx=\int ds \int_{\Sigma(s)} f \sqrt{-g} W^\alpha n_\alpha d\Sigma.$$ I might be wrong though, and it might only work with $\phi$ and with the hypothesis on the support of $f$. The thing is: how this is proven? Actually, if $\phi : (-\epsilon,\epsilon)\times M\to M$ is the flow of $W$ so that $\phi_t : M\to M$ is the diffeomorphism moving points a parameter value $t$ on the integral curves, we can consider the set $$A = \{\phi(s,p) \in M :s\in (-\epsilon,\epsilon),p\in \Sigma(s)\}$$ Then if $\varphi : U\subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1}\to \Sigma(s)$ is a parametrization of the hypersurface, we shall have a parametrization $\psi : (-\epsilon,\epsilon)\times U\to A$ given by $$\psi(s,q)=\phi(s,\varphi(q)).$$ Let $(y^\alpha)$ a coordinate system on $(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\times U\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $(x^\mu)$ a coordinate system on $M$ Now pick $f\in C^\infty_0(M)$, the $n$-form $f\epsilon$ has compact support, where $\epsilon$ is the Lorentzian volume form. But if $h : M\to \mathbb{R}$ is $h = \sqrt{|g|}$ what we want is to integrate $\omega = fh dx^0\wedge\cdots \wedge dx^{n-1}$. But by a theorem on Spivak DG Vol. 1 (7.7) we have $$\psi^\ast \omega=(fh\circ\psi) \det\left(\dfrac{\partial(x^\mu \circ \psi)}{\partial y^\alpha}\right) dy^0\wedge \cdots dy^{n-1}$$ The issue now is to compute that determinant. I concluded (not much rigorously really) that $$\dfrac{\partial(x^\mu \circ \psi)}{\partial y^0}=W^\mu\circ \psi$$ While for the other I computed not rigorously also that $$\dfrac{\partial(x^\mu \circ \psi)}{\partial y^i}=\dfrac{\partial(x^\mu\circ \phi)}{\partial x^\nu}\dfrac{\partial (x^\nu\circ \varphi)}{\partial y^i}$$ The first seems to be the Jacobian of the flow of $W$, the second seems to be the components of $\varphi_\ast e_i$ so the basis of the tangent spaces of $\Sigma$ induced by the basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. If I'm not mistaken this is the same as $$\dfrac{\partial(x^\mu \circ \psi)}{\partial y^i}=\phi_{\ast}(\varphi_\ast e_i)=(\phi\circ\varphi)_\ast e_i$$ So the first column of the matrix are the components of $W$ and the $i$-th column are the components of the $i$-th basis vector of $\mathbb{R}^n$ pushed to $M$ throguh $(\phi\circ\varphi)$ - the parametrization followed by the flow. Now I think that the normal covector $n$ is $$n = \star (\phi\circ\varphi)_\ast e_1\wedge \cdots \wedge (\phi\circ\varphi)_\ast e_{n-1}$$ The matrix above has $W$ in one column and these vectors on the others. Computing the determinant with the Levi-Civita symbol $\varepsilon_{\mu_1\dots\mu_n}$ gives $$\det(J)=\varepsilon_{\mu_1\dots \mu_n} W^{\mu_1} (\phi\circ\varphi)_\ast e_1^{\mu_2}\cdots e_{n-1}^{\mu_n}$$ But then combining with the factor $h\circ \psi$ we factored will turn the Levi Civita symbol to $\epsilon_{\mu_1\cdots\mu_n}$ which in turn gives the Hodge dual $$\psi^\ast \epsilon = (f \epsilon_{\mu_1\cdots \mu_n}\circ \psi W^{\mu_1})\circ \psi(\phi\circ\varphi)_\ast e_1^{\mu_2}\cdots(\phi\circ\varphi)_\ast e_{n-1}^{\mu_n} dy^0\wedge \cdots \wedge dy^{n-1}= (fW^\mu n_\mu)\circ \psi dy^0\wedge\cdots \wedge dy^{n-1} $$ I just don't know if this is right.

$$g(x)=\coth(a)(x-\cosh(a)) + \sinh(a)$$ If my equations are correct, I’m wondering why they’re the only difference between the two is the negative term before cotangent in the circle linearization but no negative term in the hyperbola linearization.

2487373,Non measurable vector subspace of a Banach space,"My question is the following: Let $(E,\Vert\cdot\Vert_E)$ be a real Banach space, $\mathcal{B}(E)$ its Borel sigma algebra (i.e. the sigma algebra containing all open balls). Is it possible for a vector subspace $V$ of $E$ to be non-measurable? In particular, is it possible in the case $E$ is separable? The question arises from this particular case: let $A:D(A)\to F$ be a closed operator, where $(F,\Vert\cdot\Vert_F)$ is another Banach space and $D(A)$ is a vector subspace of $E$. Let $X$ be an $E$-valued random variable (from a standard probability space) such that $X$ belongs to $D(A)$ $\mathbb{P}$-almost surely. Is it true that $AX$ is an $F$-valued random variable? In the case I impose $D(A)$ to be measurable, I can prove it without difficulties. So the (more specific than the one above) question is: does a closed operator $A$ defined on a non measurable domain $D(A)$ exist? In the case the space $F$ is reflexive, I'm able to show that $D(A)$ must be measurable by expressing it as a countable union of closed sets, but I have no idea how to approach the problem without any assumption on $F$. UPDATE I'm trying to construct a counterxample using the following space: $$E=\bigg\{ f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R} \text{ such that } \sum_{x\in [0,1]} f(x)^2<\infty\bigg\}$$ where the sum (of nonnegative elements) over a non countable set in defined in the following way: $$\sum_{x\in [0,1]} a_x = \sup\bigg\{ \sum_{i\in I} a_i : I\subset [0,1] \text{ finite} \bigg\}$$ In the case the elements can have both positive and negative sign but $\sum_{x\in [01]}\vert a_x\vert <\infty$, then the sum $\sum_{x\in [0,1]} a_x$ is defined by taking positive and negative parts respectively. This definition of sum has the nice property that if $\sum_{x\in [0,1]} \vert a_x\vert<\infty$, then there can be at most a countable amount of points $x$ such that $a_x\neq0$. Now $E$ is a vector space that can be normed with
$$ \Vert f\Vert_E = \sqrt{\sum_{x\in [0,1]} f(x)^2}$$
which is induced by the scalar product
$$\langle f,g\rangle = \sum_{x\in [0,1]} f(x)g(x)$$
It can be shown that $E$ is a Banach (and therefore Hilbert) space; it is not separable, since the family $\{e_x : x\in [0,1]\}$ ($e_x$ denotes the function that sents $x$ to $1$ and everything else to $0$) is an uncountable, $1$-separated family. Moreover $\{e_x : x\in [0,1]\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $E$ (in the sense that is a family of orthonormal elements such that any $f\in E$ can be arbitrarily approximated by finite linear combinations of it). I think $E$ is a good place where to search for a counterexample since it's nice enough to work with it but at the same time a bit strange (it contains infinite copies of the $l^2$ space). In order to show that a subspace is not measurable, I should show that it is the image through a measurable map of a non measurable set from another measurable space. My candidate for the non measurable subspace was something like
$$ V = span\{ e_x : x\in A\}$$
where $A$ is a Vitali set (or any other non measurable subset of [0,1]). So what I'd like is a measurable map $T:(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))\to (E,\mathcal{B}(E))$ (actually $T$ does not need to start from $\mathbb{R}$ but I guess that's the space one would work with) such that the image of a non measurable subset through $T$ is $V$. However I haven't find anything so far. Any ideas? Any help would be much appreciated!","['operator-theory', 'banach-spaces', 'measure-theory', 'vector-spaces']"

2487452,Motivation behind proof,"The following problem is taken from IMC $2017$ Day $1$, August $2, 2017$. Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to(0,\infty)$ be a differentiable function, and suppose that there exists a constant $L>0$ such that 
  $$|f'(x)-f'(y)|\leq L|x-y|$$
  for all $x,y.$
  Prove that 
  $$(f'(x))^2<2Lf(x)$$
  holds for all $x.$ The official solution goes as follows: Solution: Notice that $f'$ satisfies the Lipschitz-property, so $f'$ is continuous and therefore locally integrable. Consider an arbitrary $x\in\mathbb{R}$ and let $d=f'(x).$
  We need to prove $f(x)>\frac{d^2}{2L}.$ If $d=0,$ then the statement is trivial. If $d>0,$ then the condition provides $f'(x-t) \geq d-Lt;$ this estimate is positive for $1\leq t <\frac{d}{L}.$
  By integrating over that interval, 
  $$f(x)>f(x)-f(x-\frac{d}{L})=\int_0^{\frac{d}{L}}f'(x-t) \,dt \geq \int_0^{\frac{d}{L}}(d-Lt)\,dt=\frac{d^2}{2L}.$$
  If $d<0,$ then apply $f'(x+t)\leq d+Lt=-|d|+Lt$ and repeat the same argument as 
  $$f(x)>f(x)-f(x+\frac{|d|}{L}) = \int_0^{\frac{|d|}{L}}(-f'(x+t))\,dt \geq \int_0^{\frac{|d|}{L}}(|d|-Lt)\, dt = \frac{d^2}{2L}.$$ Question: What is a motivation behind the proof above? Yes, I can fully understand the solution if I read line by line. However, I attempted the problem myself for 1 hour and could not get anywhere. It would be good if someone can tell me a motivation of considering the proof above. It is okay if you want to provide an alternative solution to the problem.

Since the resultant equation is of order $mn$ then the number of common points is exactly $mn$ counting the multiplicities (by the homogeneity of $\mathrm{Res}$ and fundamental thm. of algebra) . And the aforementioned exercise shows that the multiplicity of the root in the resultant is actually the product of multiplicities of the root $A$ for $C_1,C_2$. The problem is that the multiplicity of a point for an algebraic curve is defined through reduction of the equation of the curve on the lines and looking for the order of the root for this one-dimensional polynom.So reducting the resultant on some lines gives big formulas in which I cannot see what is the order of the corresponding root.","['algebraic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2487841,Product of vector bundles.,"If $\pi_1:E_1\to M$ and $\pi_2:E_2\to M$ are two vector bundles over $M$, then we can construct a new vector bundle $E_1\oplus E_2$ by declaring the fibre at each $x\in M$ to be $(E_1\oplus E_2)_x:=(E_1)_x\oplus(E_2)_x$. One usually calls this (to my knowledge) the Whitney sum of $E_1$ and $E_2$. One could denote this by $E_1\times E_2$, but this seems rather unnecessary. My question: if I encounter the notation $E_1\times E_2$, could any other vector bundle than the Whitney sum bundle be meant?

2487845,$x(p − x)y(p − y)$ is square implies $x = y$,"Given a prime $p > 2$ and positive integers $x,y \le \frac{p − 1}{2}$, prove that if $x(p − x)y(p − y)$ is a perfect square, then $x = y$. This question was previously asked without context , and so was closed, but I did start towards a solution. The primary insight is that the result depends on the unique representation of a prime as a sum of squares . Obviously if that were not true we could have $m_0^2+n_0^2=m_1^2+n_1^2=p$. Then we could choose $x=m_0^2$ and $y=m_1^2$ as the lesser parts of those two different representations and with all contributing values being square, get a square that disproves the claim. The other strand of proof that I did not succeed in completing was to eliminate the possibility that the various components might multiply together to give a square. Here are my thoughts on this so far: Since $p$ prime, $x$ is coprime to $v:=(p-x)$ and $y$ is coprime to $w:=(p-y)$. Find $g :=\gcd(x,y)$ and $h:=\gcd(v,w)$, and set $(a,b,c,d):=(x/g,y/g,v/h,w/h)$. If one of these terms is $1$ then all are, and $x=y$. Assume that we have $a,b,c,d>1$. Then the expression of interest is $abcdg^2h^2$, which is square iff $abcd$ is square. The only possible common factors are in the pairs $(a,d)$ and $(b,c)$ so we would need $ad$ square and $bc$ square. Can anyone either complete my proof or find a better way to demonstrate the truth of the opening claim?","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"
2487877,Can we determine an oblique asymptote of a function by the limit of $f'(x)$?,"Some references show that to find an oblique asymptote of a function $f(x)$ , we must see the limit of $$ m = \lim_{x \rightarrow \pm \infty} \frac{f(x)}{x} $$ If $m \ne 0$ and finite, then there is an oblique asymptote of the form $y = mx + c$ .
However, I think it would be more intuitive by searching the limit of $$ \lim_{x \rightarrow \pm \infty} f'(x) $$ If this limit exists, then we can determine the asymptote. Question : Am I correct if I generalize the 2nd one for finding an oblique asymptote? I have not seen any reference to use the second one (limit of $f'$ ) for finding an oblique asymptote. But it is more intuituive .., and we can also see from the first one that $\lim \limits_{x \rightarrow \pm \infty} \frac fx  $ has an indefinite form $\frac{\infty}{\infty} $ , then by L'Hopital it can be equal to $\lim f'(x)$ .

The preferred value for a is the smaller one, so that c can be larger, which causes a greater change on the grades. I stopped here because I couldn't find a way to solve the two equations and get the values of c and a.

where the harmonic mean $HM$, geometric mean $GM$ and arithmetic mean $AM$ are defined as:
$$

\text{and} \quad
AM = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i}.
$$ What I know so far We have equality if $n=2$ or if $x_1 = \dots = x_n$. I haven't been able to prove the inequality in general, but for $n=3$ (let's use $x_1,x_2,x_3 = a,b,c$ for clarity) we obtain:
$$
\frac{\frac{a+b+c}{3}}{\frac{3}{\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}}}

We can look at this like fitting three $a \times b$, three $b \times c$ and three $c \times a$ rectangles inside a square with side-length $a+b+c$.

2488309,$f$ is Continuous if and only if its Graph is Closed in $X \times Y$,"Let $f: X \to Y$ ; let $Y$ be compact Hausdorff. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if $G_f = \{(x,f(x)) \mid x \in X \}$ is closed. Here is my shot at a proof: Suppose that $f : X \to Y$ is continuous, and let $(x,y) \in \overline{G_f}$ but assume $y \neq f(x)$ . As $Y$ is Hausdorff, there exists $U,V$ open in $Y$ and disjoint such that $y \in U$ and $f(x) \in V$ . Since $V$ is a nbhd of $f(x)$ and $f$ is continuous, there exists an $O \subseteq X$ that is open and contains $x$ such that $f(O) \subseteq V$ . Since $O \times U$ is an open nbhd of $(x,y)$ , there must be some $(p,q) \in G_f \cap O \times U$ . This means $p \in O$ and that $f(p)=q \in U$ . But $f(O) \subseteq V$ , so $U$ and $V$ must intersect--a contradiction. Hence $y= f(x)$ and $G_f$ must be closed. Now we show the other direction. Suppose that $G_f$ is closed, let $x \in X$ be arbitrary, and let $V$ be a open nhbd of $f(x)$ . Then $Y-V$ is closed, and therefore the intersection $C:=G_f \cap [X \times (Y-V)]$ is closed in $X \times Y$ . By an earlier problem, we know that $\pi_1$ is a closed map and so $\pi_1(C)$ is closed in $X$ , and therefore $X-\pi_1(C)$ is open. I will argue that $x \in X-\pi_1(C)$ by contradiction. If $x$ were in $\pi_1(C)$ , then there would exist a $p \in X$ and a $q \in Y-V$ such that $f(p)=q$ and $x= \pi_1(p,f(p))$ or $x=p$ . But this would mean $f(x)=q \in Y-V$ or $f(x) \notin V$ , which contradicts the assumption that $V$ is a nbhd of $f(x)$ . Hence $x \in X - \pi_1(C)$ . Now we argue that $a \in f^{-1}(V)$ if and only if $a \notin a \notin \pi_1(C)$ . Suppose that $a \in \pi_1(C)$ . Then $a = \pi(p,f(p))$ or $a=p$ where $f(p) \in Y-V$ . This means that $f(a) \in Y - V$ and therefore $a \notin f^{-1}(V)$ . Now suppose that $a \notin f^{-1}(V)$ . Then $f(a) \notin V$ and therefore $f(a) \in Y-V$ . From this we get $(a,f(a)) \in G_f \cap [X \times (Y-V)] = C$ which implies $a \in \pi_1(C)$ . From this we can conclude that if $a \in X-\pi_1(C)$ , then $f(a) \in V$ , proving that $f(X-\pi_1(C)) \subseteq V$ which in turn proves that $f$ is continuous.

Assume that a surface $S$ admits two differentiable orthogonal families of geodesics. Prove that the Gaussian curvature of $S$ is zero. where a differentiable field of directions is: Definition: A field of direction $r$ in a open $U \cap S$ is a correspondence which assigns to each $p$ $\in$ $U\cap S$ a line $r(p)$ in $T_pS$ passing through $p$ . $r$ is said to be diferentiable at $p$ $\in$ $U \cap S$ if there exists a nonzero differentiable vector field $w$ , defined in a neighborhood $V\cap S$ $\subset$ $U \cap S$ of $p$ , such that for each $q$ $\in$ $V\cap S$ , $w(q) \neq 0$ is a basis of $r(q)$ ; $r$ is diferentiable in $U\cap S$ if it is differentiable for every $p$ $\in$ $U$ . At the end of the book, Manfredo give us the following hint Manfredo's Hint : Parametrize a neighborhood of $p\in S$ in such a way that the two families of geodesics are coordinate curves (Corollary 1, Sec. 3-4). Show that this implies that $F=0$ , $E_v=0, $ $G_u = 0$ . Make a change of parameters to obtain that $\bar{F} = 0$ , $\bar{E} = \bar{G} =1$ . where Corollary 1, Sec.3-4 is: Corollary 1.

Let $\tau_1$ be the field of directions associated to the first family, and $\tau_2$ be the field of directions associated to the second family (note that $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are orthogonal). I really don't understand why when we apply the Corollary 1 (Sec. 3-4), on the fields of directions $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ , we end up getting a chart $x: U \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow W \cap S$ , in such a way that the coordinate curves, $x(u, c^{te})$ and $x(c^{te},v)$ , are the two families of geodesics. From what I know, when the coordinate curves are the integral curves of 
 fields of directions $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ , we can only conclude that $x_u(u, c^{te})$ is l.d with the direction $\tau_1(x(u, c^{te}))$ and $x_v(c^{te},v)$ is l.d. with the direction $\tau_2(x(c^{te}, v))$ . GI can't see any reason for these coordinate curves to solve the geodesic's differential equation.

I need to find the probability that the sum of the values rolled in those $100$ times is less than $300$ . So for the sum, we want to look at the random variable $Y=X_1+X_2+...+X_{100}$ . Every $X_i$ should have the same mean and variance, let's say the mean is $\mu$ and the variance is $\sigma^2$ . Then the mean of $Y$ would be $100\mu$ and the variance is $100\sigma^2$ . We want to find $P(Y<300)$ . Using a continuity correction, we want to look at $P(Y<300.5)$ .
Then $P(Y<300.5)=P\left({Z<\dfrac{300.5-100\mu}{\sqrt{100 \sigma^2}}}\right)$ . I could find the answer from here. However, I am having a hard time figuring out what $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ should equal. I know that $\mu=np$ and $\sigma^2=np(1-p)$ for a normal approximation. But I don't know what $n$ and $p$ would be for the $X_1, X_2, ..., X_{100}$ or if that is the correct way to go about this problem.

Changing $a$ and $c$ has the effect I'd expect; $a$ determines the direction/scaling of the parabola, and $c$ shifts it vertically, but changing $b$ shifts the graph in a way I found rather unexpected. Keeping $a$ and $c$ the same and sliding $b$ around seems to move the parabola along another downwards parabolic arc; I assumed that the arc might be just a flipped version of the original parabola, and sure enough, graphing $-ax^{2}+c$ showed me that the first parabola's vertex was moving perfectly along the path traced by the second. Some further experimentation in Desmos also opened up a connection for me of the tangent line of the parabola $ax^{2}+bx+c$ and the line $bx$. ( Link to the Desmos graph here ) What I'm curious about is: Why is this the case?

Why is this true? Indeed, I just proved that it cannot be true in an uncountable space with the cofinite topology. Is this proof flawed? This steps seems crucial in obtaining a contradiction. What I am trying to do is prove that if $X$ is an uncountable set with the cofinite topology, then it cannot be first countable. I read this , but I couldn't see how to use Brian Scott's hints. Here is what he wrote: To prove that $X$ is not first countable, you must show that some point of $X$ does not have a countable local base. All points of $X$ ‘look alike’ in the cofinite topology, so it doesn’t matter what point we pick, so let $x\in X$ be any point. Suppose that $\mathscr{B}=\{B_n:n\in\Bbb N\}$ is a countable local base of open sets at the point $x$, meaning that if $U$ is any open nbhd of $x$, then $x\in B_n\subseteq U$ for some $n\in\Bbb N$. For each $n\in\Bbb N$ let $F_n=X\setminus B_n$: $B_n$ is open, so by definition $F_n$ is finite. Let $F=\{x\}\cup\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}F_n$; $F$ is the union of countably many finite sets, so $F$ is countable. $X$ is uncountable, so there is some $y\in X\setminus F$. Let $U=X\setminus\{y\}$. Is $U$ an open nbhd of $x$? Is there any $n\in\Bbb N$ such that $x\in B_n\subseteq U$? I would answer the first question affirmatively; and to answer the question, which is presumably ""no"", I would suppose that there is such an $n \in \Bbb{N}$. But I am having trouble identifying the contradiction. Before I even sought help from google, I tried the following (and several variations on it). Let $x \in X$, and let $y \in X - \{x\}$. Then $X-\{y\}$ is open and therefore there is an open set $U_y$ such that $x \in U_y \subseteq X - \{y\}$. Thus we have a mapping $y \mapsto U_y$. I tried to show this mapping is injective, but I couldn't. If I had succeeded, then I believe this would have shown that if there were any basis at $x$, it would have to be uncountable, which means that $X$ is not first countable. But, as you may have noticed, I abjectly failed in this task. Is there a way to get any of these to proves to work, especially the one I proposed?","['general-topology', 'proof-explanation']"
