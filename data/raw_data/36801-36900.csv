354926,Why are complex finite-dimensional irreducible representations of abelian groups one-dimensional?,I'm supposed to show that each Complex finite-dimensional irreducible representation of an abelian group is one dimensional. For any map $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ it holds that $\phi(\rho(g)v) = \rho(g) \phi(v)$ . Also since the group $\rho(h) \rho(g) v = \rho(g) \rho(h) v$ . From a previous exercise I know that $\phi = \lambda \cdot id_V$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ . This transforms the previous equation into $\lambda \cdot id_V \cdot (\rho(g)v) = \rho(g) \lambda \cdot id_V \cdot v$ which implies that $\lambda \cdot id_V \cdot (\rho(g)v) =\lambda \cdot \rho(g) \cdot v$ .

354942,Proof that $E(X)<\infty$ entails $\lim_{n\to\infty}n\Pr(X\ge n) = 0$?,"As the title says. I think this should follow straightforwardly but I can't find a proof. My random variable of interest $X$ takes values in the non-negative integers. The only other assumption on its distribution is that $E(X)<\infty$. I want to prove:
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}n\Pr(X\ge n) = 0.$$
The fact that this should follow is referenced e.g. by DeGroot (2004) ""Optimal Statistical Decisions"" p. 295, but no proof is given. All I have right now is that without the constant $n$ it is easy to prove using Markov's inequality:
$$\Pr(X\ge n) \le \frac{1}{n}E(X) \to 0.$$

Let $A$ be any uncountable set, and let $B$ be a countable subset of $A$. Prove that $|A| = |A - B|$ The answer key that I am reading right now follows this idea: It says that $A-B$ is infinite and proceeds to define a new denumerable subset $A-B$ as $C$. Of course since $C$ is countably infinite then we can write $C$ as ${c1,c2,c3...}$ Once we have a set $C$, we know that the union of $C$ and $B$ must be denumerable (from another proof) since $B$ is countable and $C$ is denumerable. This is where I start to have trouble. The rest of the solution goes like this... Since the union of $C$ and $B$ is denumerable, there is a bijective function $f$ that maps the union of $C$ and $B$ to $C$ again. The solution then proceeds to define another function $h$ that maps $A$ to $A-B$. I am just so lost. The thing is I don't even understand the point of constructing a new subset $C$ or defining functions like $f$ or $h$. So I suppose my question is in general, how would one approach this problem? I am not mathematically inclined unfortunately, and a lot of the steps in almost all of these problems seems arbitrary and random.

For $\alpha = 6$, say I get one level set, and for $\alpha = 6+\epsilon$ for some small $\epsilon$, I get another level set. I want to show that in the right half plane, the area between the two level sets will be bounded by $\epsilon$ times a constant. Of course, I would like to show that this property holds for any $\alpha$ and sufficiently small $\epsilon$ (In this case the constant multiplier may depend on $\alpha$). This curve with the equation above is just one example. The main question is how can I do this for any curve (assuming that curve has some certain properties)? (Although it would also be nice to see an answer for the particular case above). Answers in the form ""Read this noob"" would also be greatly appreciated. $\textbf{Edit:}$ To clarify, formally, we consider the solutions of the equation $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) - \alpha g(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0$, where $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are real coordinates, $f$ and $g$ are (say) polynomials. Let $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha} = \{(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n:f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) - \alpha g(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0\}$. Roughly, I would like to show something like ($\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure)

355251,"""Optical Illusion"" in 4D","(Apologies in advance for the wordiness - not very mathematical, I know!) I open my book of Escher optical illusions and look at the 2D page.  ""Aha!"" my brain says - ""That image doesn't make sense when I try to interpret it as a representation of a 3D scene.  Isn't Escher clever?"" Conceptually, I could throw a Flatlander into the Escher picture and he could explore the 2D page.  The shapes on the page wouldn't make much sense to him but he could move around them (and possibly peek inside them to explore their interiors, by cutting them open) all the same.  Patiently I could explain that there's this third dimension unknown to him and if only he look at the shapes from this third dimension, he might understand the cleverness of Escher and how the perfectly-valid 2D shapes combine to make an optical illusion for 3D beings.  If he's bright enough, he might actually be able to conceptualise the mathematics of viewing things in three dimensions. So, by analogy, a hypothetical 4D being could open her ""book"" of optical illusions and look at the 3D page.  Her brain would be suitably fooled and amused as she examined the 3D objects and tried to interpret them as a 4D scene. If this statement is correct (and perhaps it isn't - perhaps an ""optical illusion"" in 4D is provably impossible?), then it should be possible for us to construct some 3D solids (possibly with non-trivial interiors) and arrange them in a way which we could convince ourselves would imply an optical illusion if only we were to look at them from a 4D point-of-view.

355301,Non-degenerate solutions to constant Hamiltonian flow,"As I'm trying to work my way through Dietmar Salamon's ""Notes on Floer Homology"", I'm having trouble with the very first exercise. Let $(M, \omega)$ be a compact symplectic manifold. Let $H$ be a real function on $M$, let $X$ be the vector field associated to $dH$ under the isomorphism $TM \simeq T^{*}M$ induced by $\omega$. Let $x \in M$ be a critical point for $H$, ie. $dH(x) = 0$. If $\phi _{t}: M \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow M$ is the flow associated to $X$ (that is, $\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \phi _{t} = X \circ \phi_{t}$), then $x$ is a fixed point of this flow. In particular $\phi_{1}(x) = x$. We will say that $x$ is non-degenerate if $det(id - d\phi_{1}(x)) \neq 0$. This happens exactly when $d\phi_{1}(x)$ has no fixed vectors. The problem is as follows. Show that under these assumptions $x$ is also a non-degenerate critical point for $H$. One possible way to state that is that in any local coordinate system $x_{i}$ around $x$, the matrix $(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x_{i} \partial x_{j}} H) _{i, j}$ is non-singular. I tried to reason as follows. Since $X(x) = 0$, infinitesimally at time $0$ and around $x$ points are (up to first order) not moved by $\phi$ at all. However, as I let the flow run for one unit of time I perform some form of ""integration"" that makes the second order changes by $\phi$ ""go up an order"" and become visible in $d\phi_{1}$. Thus, I should interpret the condition that $d\phi_{1}$ has no fixed vectors as a sing that $X = dH$ moves all vectors around $x$ in a second-order change, ie. $dH$ is non-degenerate. I was trying to formalize the ""implication"" $(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \phi_{t} = X \circ \phi_{t}) \  \Rightarrow  \ \phi_{1} = \int\limits_{0}^{1} X \circ \phi_{t} \ dt$ so that later I could differentiate both sides with respect to $x$, but I quickly run into trouble because I am not working in the euclidean space, where - up till now - I have always ""gotten by"" using coordinate-free descriptions, since the problem I worked on were rather simple-minded. I would be very interested in a coordinate-free and proof with coordinates, but it would be most useful if it was formal, because I think my problems stem from a large lack of experiance with these kinds of problems.

355383,Algebraic way to change limits of integration of a double integral,"I know how to graphically change the limits of integration of a double integral. That is, by graphing the region and eyeballing (a.ka.a ""looking at"") it to determine the new limits. But an answer to a question hints that there is an algebraic method - I hope I'm using that term correctly - to finding the limits , and I want to know what that is . The problem is to change the order of integration of
$$\int_0^1 \int_0^{3x} f(x,y)\ dy\ dx.$$
The answer is
$$\int_0^3 \int_{\frac y3}^1 f(x,y)\ dx\ dy.$$ The book's solution reads: The region of integration is $0 \le x \le 1,\ 0 \le y \le 3x$. Writing
   $y=3x$ as $x=\frac y3$, we see that the inequalities translate into $0
 \le y \le 3,\ \frac y3 \le x \le 1$. That suggests that there is an algebraic way to find the new limits. So, I can get one of the intervals by just following the solution's directions (i.e. substitute $x=\frac y3$ into the first inequality)
$$ 0 \le x \le 1 \\
0 \le \frac y3 \le 1 \\
0 \le y \le 3.$$
So far so good. But the same process does not work for the second inequality. I just get $0 \le x \le x$. What's the procedure to change the limits of integration for this (or any) problem algebraically?","['multivariable-calculus', 'integration']"

The community reviewed whether to reopen this question 2 years ago and left it closed: Original close reason(s) were not resolved Improve this question I attend a mostly liberal arts focused university, in which I was able to test out of an ""Introduction to Proofs"" class and directly into ""Advanced Calculus 1"" (Introductory Analysis I) and I loved it. I did great in the class. I was not very mathematically mature at the time, but I studied hard and started to outpace many of the senior level students who had a least a good year or more of experience than me. Furthermore, the professor teaching the course was apparently known to be particularly difficult, but I loved his course. I enjoyed the challenge and wound up with a B+, the 2nd highest grade given in the class. I took Advanced Calculus 2 and loved it even more. The professor even suggested that I take a graduate complex analysis course in the Fall. (Just a side note here, the undergraduate complex analysis course at my school does not use any theorem's or proofs. The grad version is similar to say, an honors undergraduate course at more traditional math program.) I took this as a high complement, and a verification that I was in fact doing well. I know I am not very deep into analysis, but I feel comfortable with the subject, even with the more abstract parts. However, I am really struggling with abstract algebra. I can't understand why. I study the material really hard. I am doing better than most in the class, and I am maintaining a solid B average, but I really have trouble thinking about algebra like I do analysis. I feel like I am mostly just regurgitating theorems and techniques just to pass the exams. I know I can pass the course, but I also know that this mindless memorization will eventually come back to haunt me later on in my mathematical career. Algebra is truly one of the pillars of math which is why I really feel terrible that I don't understand it. Is this a sign that I simply don't have what it takes to succeed in math? I would love to go on to graduate school and hopefully get a PhD. In fact, a professor actually said to me, ""I think it would be a shame if you didn't go to grad school for math."" He told me that before I took algebra, but now I feel like my world is ""crashing down"" in a sense. Before I was a ""good"" student; now, I feel like a zombie in the back of the room.

Define a stopping time $$T := \inf\{n: S_n \notin (-a,b)\},$$
where $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$. (1) Show $S_n^2-n$ is a martingale and compute $P(S_T = b)$. (2) Find $ET$. (3) Show that $S_n^4-6nS_n^2+3n^2+2n$ is a martingale and find $\text{var}(T)$. (1) Showing that $S_n^2 -n$ is a martingale is simple. 
Also, $S_n$ is a martingale. Then
since $T < \infty$ a.s., we get
$$(-a)P(S_T = -a) + b(1-P(S_T=-a)) $$$$= ES_T = E\lim S_{\min(T,n)} \overset{D.C.T.}{=} \lim ES_{\min(T,n)} = \lim ES_0 = 0.$$
Thus $P(S_T = -a) = b/(a+b)$ and $P(S_T = b) = a/(a+b)$. (2) I want to say this: $$E(S_T^2-T) = E\lim(S_{\min(T,n)}^2-\min(T,n)) \overset{?}{=} \lim E(S_{\min(T,n)}^2 - \min(T,n)) = \lim E(S_0^2 - 0) = 0,$$
but I don't know how to justify interchanging the limit and expectation there. If this equality holds, then $ET = ES_T^2$, which I can compute. (3) I can show that the given expression is a martingale. Again, if exchanging limits and expectations is justified, I get
$$ E(S_T^4-6TS_T^2+3T^2 +2T) = E(S_0^4-6\cdot 0 \cdot S_0 +3\cdot 0 +2 \cdot 0) = 0.$$

Derivatives cannot be applied to $f(x)$ because it is not continuous.  The floor function is what causes the problem.  A better approach is either to analyze the size of the error term based on $x$ or define $f(x)$ in terms of the gamma function which is continuous.

Furthermore let's suppose that $K:L$ is separable. I'm trying to understand why it is that $|f^{-1}(p)| = d$ for all but finitely many $p \in D$. Basically, I want to show that if $f$ is unramified at $p$ then it's unramified on an open neighborhood of $p$, then show that if $K:L$ is separable then $f$ is unramified at at least one such point. I have an argument in progress but there's something I don't quite understand. If $p \in D$ then we can let $q_1,\ldots,q_k$ be the preimages under $f$, find some $g$ that has distinct values at all $q_i$, then let $m$ be the minimal polynomial of $g$ over $L$ (which has coefficients in $B$, for algebraic reasons). Because $m$ has coefficients in $B$ we can form $m_0$ where we just evaluate all of its coefficients at $p$. Then $m_0$ has at least $k$ distinct roots (namely, $g(q_i)$). Obviously $\partial m = \partial m_0 \leq d$ as well. So if $p$ is ramified, then the roots of $m$ - and $m_0$ - are distinct hence $\Delta m_0 = \Delta m(p) \neq 0$. This is an algebraic condition so there is a neighborhood on which $\Delta m$ is nonzero, etc. However, there's something I'm missing. I don't know that it makes sense to say that $\Delta m(p') \neq 0$ means that $f$ is unramified at $p'$. After all, $m$ doesn't appear to have a lot to do with $p'$. But $m$ can't change from point to point because then it's not an algebraic condition anymore - it's a logical condition. There should be something that says that if some fixed $m_0$ has $d$ distinct roots then $p$ has $d$ distinct pullbacks, but I can't find it.

I am wondering how evaluate the integral: $$ \int_{0}^{2 \pi } \frac{1}{a + \sin( \theta) } d \theta $$ by means of methods of complex analysis. In the homework assignment, the following hint is given: write $\sin( \theta ) = (e^{i \theta } - e^{- i \theta} ) / 2i $ and interpret the integral (after some algebraic manipulations) as a complex line integral of a rational function over the positively oriented unit circle. I write $\theta := t$, so I'll have to type less. This is how I approached the question: We know, from the definition of the complex line integral, that $$ \int_{ \alpha } f(t) dt = \int_{a}^{b} f( \alpha (t) ) \alpha ' (t) .$$
In our case, we have $\alpha(t) = e^{i t}$. So, if we want to rewrite our ""ordinary"" integral as a complex line integral, we have the equation $$ f( \alpha (t) ) \cdot e^{i t} = \frac{1}{a + \frac{ e^{i t} - 1/e^{i t} }{2i} } $$. If we divide both sides by $e^{i t}$, and rewrite the denominator of the resulting fraction a bit, we obtain: $$f( \alpha (t)) = \frac{2i}{e^{2 i t} + 2 i a e^{i t} -1 } . $$ Since we already noted, that $ \alpha(t) = e^{i t} $, I thought that, based on this, we can deduce that $$f(t) = \frac{2i}{t^2 + 2 i a t - 1} $$. From here, I'm not entirely sure how to proceed. One possibility is to find the roots of the polynomial in the denominator of the fraction in the integral, by means of the (abc)-rule. We obtain the roots $t_1 =i a - \sqrt{1 -a} $ and $t_2 = i a + \sqrt{ 1 - a }$. We know, that $a >1 $, so we can rewrite these roots: $t_1 = i a - i \sqrt{a-1} = i(a - \sqrt{a-1} $ , and $t_2 = i a + i \sqrt{a-1} = i (a + \sqrt{a-1} ) $, so we can rewrite our integral as follows: $$ \int_{ \alpha } \frac{1}{ (t - t_1) (t-t_2) } $$ . But how do we proceed from here? We don't know the value of $a$, so we don't know how ""big"" the roots are. Could we use the Cauchy Integral Formula? Or something else?

355994,Two principal ideals coincide if and only if their generators are associated,"Suppose we have a ring $R$ and $(a),(b)$ are both ideals of $R$. Is it always true that $(a)=(b)$ if and only if there exists a unit $c$ such that $a=bc$ (i.e., $a$ and $b$ are associate)? I have already verified that the forwards direction is true. But I have no idea on the backward direction. If it is true, can someone provide a proof to me? Backward direction: Suppose that there exists a unit $c \in R$ such that $a=bc$. This implies that $(a)\subset (b)$. By using the same thing, (i.e., $b$ and $a$ are associate), there exists a unit $d \in R$ such that $b=ad$. This implies that $(b) \subset (a)$. is this correct?","['commutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
356029,Mathematical Induction: how do we know what applies to one thing also applies to another?,"Background: I'm new to math. I'm learning about set theory. The book I'm reading (Schaum's Outline of Set Theory) covers mathematical induction. The book uses a common illustration and a common example (I could only find the same illustration and example when I searched on-line) to illustrate how mathematical induction works. Illustration: ""...it is like a row of standing dominoes. First, demonstrate that one standing domino falls after it is pushed. Second, demonstrate that pushing over one standing domino will knock down the second. Essentially, that proves that a row of standing dominoes will fall if the first is pushed."" (taken from decodedscience.com) Example: ""(1) 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n^2 (2) If x_1, x_2, ..., x_n > 0 then (x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n)/n ≥ (x1·x2·...·xn)^1/n 
etc. n here is an ""arbitrary"" integer. It's convenient to talk about a statement P(n). For (1), P(1) says that 1 = 12 which is incidently true. P(2) says that 1 + 3 = 22, P(3) means that 1 + 3 + 5 = 32. And so on. These particular cases are obtained by substituting specific values 1, 2, 3 for n into P(n).""
(Taken from cut-the-knot.org) What I Understand: I know that Mathematical Induction and The Other Induction are different.  I know that they are both about drawing conclusions about the general by examining the specific. Intuitively, I can see that in the universe of math, where we have the advantage of a 'bottom-up' understanding of the laws of the universe, we can employ induction reliably I understand that the above equations tell us that the value of a set of odd integers is equal to the square of the set's cardinal. E.g., 1+3+5 = 9.  Cardinal of 3. 3^2=9. I can see that you could apply this along the whole continuum of odd integers. What I Don't Understand: I don't see why those equations were used to illustrate mathematical induction. I know little about proofs, but I believe those equations are examples and not proofs. In that case, would it not have been sufficient, but trivial, to use an example like,  'an integer is always one integer greater than the integer that preceded it' n ≺ n+1 Those equations are used everywhere to illustrate mathematical induction. Nobody uses the example I just provided. So I'm assuming there is something more valuable in those equations than in my example. What is it? I thought of some scenarios where (my understanding of) mathematical induction would be misleading. For instance, if I said that 'a prime number will be one integer greater than the prime that preceded it.' That works for the first two prime numbers (2,3), So haven't we illustrated that if you push one domino you will cause it to fall which will cause the next domino to fall...? (But in this case, the second domino will not cause the third domino to fall) As far as I (wrongly) understand: Mathematical induction is saying that, 'you can know the infinitely applicable relationship between an input and an output, so long as you have two sets of input and output from the same continuum.' What am I misunderstanding? Thank you for your help. Added P (1) is true If P (*n*) is true for any n, then P( n +1) I think that I see what I missed. "" P (1) is true,"" is A "" P(n) is true, for any n "" is B "" P(n +1) is true,"" is C I thought that what you wrote meant:
(A&B)->C In words (I may have mucked up the notation):
If P (1) is true; and any P(n) is true, for any n ; then P(n +1). In other words: That so long as you have P (1), then for any n for which P(n) is true, you also know that the next n is true (i.e., P(n + 1) ).  Since the 'next n ' (i.e., P(n + 1) ) is true, you have another 'any n for which P(n) is true';and you can know that the n following it (i.e., P(n + 2) )is also true... and you could continue this forever; thus replicating the 'domino' effect. However, it seemed to me that it would also be possible where one could find some properties of the natural numbers for which P (1) is true, and then check that property on any other number, and by coincidence, that property may appear to be true. One would then have satisfied "" P (1) is true,"", and "" P(n) is true, for any n ""; in which case, mathematical induction would mislead one to believe that P(n) was true for all natural numbers. I think that I should have understood that it meant:
(A&(B->C))<-> ' P(n) is true for all natural numbers'. In words: 'If P (1)' is true. And if it is also true that P(n + 1) is always true whenever ' P(n) is true, for any n ' Only then and always then, can we say for certain that P(n) is true for all natural numbers. I'm still curious, how "" P(n + 1) is always true whenever ' P(n) is true, for any n '"", without having to rely on 'evidence' (since now amount of evidence forms a proof). Is there something about mathematical induction that allows one to prove that, - or is another technique used to prove that it is true that "" P(n + 1) is always true whenever ' P(n) is true, for any n '""?","['induction', 'elementary-set-theory']"
