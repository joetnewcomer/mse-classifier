2002012,Deriving the equation of a circle,"I have two points, $A=(-1,3)$ and $B=(2,7)$. There is a third point $P=(x,y)$. I have found $|AP|$ and $|BP|$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. These are: $|AP| = \sqrt{(-1-x)^2 +(3-y)^2}$ $|BP| = \sqrt{(2-x)^2 +(7-y)^2}$ I have shown that the set $S = \{P:|AP| = |BP|\}$ is a straight line and determined the slope and y-intercept by expanding out $|AP| = |BP|$ and simplifying to get: $y= \frac{-3}{4}x+\frac{43}{8}$. What I can't derive is an equation for the circle $C= \{P: |AP| = \alpha|BP|\}$. I know it should be of the form $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = \alpha^2$ but when I try to tackle this algebraically I get stuck.","['circles', 'geometry']"
2002043,Orthogonality of random vectors and the inner product,"An acclaimed answer to the question What does orthogonal mean in statistics? is beautifully stripped down to $$\mathbb E[\mathbf {XY^*}]=0$$ I am not familiar with the operations involved, not just because of the inclusion of complex numbers, but most important, because I don't see the use of the inner product in this context. In this post : The vector space $\mathscr L_2$ of real-valued random variables on $(\Omega,\mathscr F,\mathbb P)$ (modulo equivalence of course) with finite
  second moment is special, because it's the only one in which the norm
  corresponds to an inner product. If $X$ and $Y$ are random variables
  in $\mathscr L_2$, we define the inner product of $X$ and $Y$ by $⟨X,Y⟩=\mathbb E[XY]$ In relations to the comments below I find this quote on Wikipedia : For real random variables $X$ and $Y$, the expected value of their
  product $\displaystyle \langle X,Y\rangle :=\operatorname {E} (XY)$ is
  an inner product. This definition of expectation as inner product can
  be extended to random vectors as well. The actual hurdle: Now, this inner product is not the dot product of two vectors, is it? If the idea is to multiply the elements of two random vectors $X$ and $Y$ and then perform the inner product of this multiplication vector with itself, we'd be getting $[XY]^2$ - more like a norm... I think there is more to inner product, included in the quotes I pasted above, and requiring knowledge of abstract algebra. This probably includes the concept of the vector space $\mathscr L_2$. What I got so far: Since, \begin{align}
Cov[X,Y]=&E[(X−E[X])\cdot(Y−E[Y])]\\
&=E[X\cdot Y]−E[X\cdot E[Y]]−E[E[X]\cdot Y]+E[E[X]\cdot E[Y]]\\
&=E[X\cdot Y]−E[X]\cdot E[Y]
\end{align}
​
and consequently, $$E[XY]=Cov[X,Y]+E[X]\cdot E[Y],$$ real-valued random variables $X$ and $Y$ are uncorrelated (different from independent) if and only if the centered variables $X-E(X)$ and $Y-E(Y)$ are orthogonal : $E[XY]=0.$","['statistics', 'complex-numbers', 'vectors']"
2002058,Modules over ring of formal power series,"I am facing the following question: Let $K$ be a commutative unital ring (can be taken to be $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$), and let $K[[\lambda]]$ be the associated ring of formal power series. I know that if $M$ is a $K$-module, then $M[[\lambda]]$ inherits a natural $K[[\lambda]]$-module structure. The question is, what condition ensures that a given $K[[\lambda]]$-module, say ${\cal M}$, to be of the form $M_0[[\lambda]],$ for some $K$-module $M_0$? I found the answer in the paper ""Algebraic cohomology and deformation theory"" of M. Gerstenhaber and D. Schack, published in the book ""Deformation theory of algebras and structures and application"". There it is just stated, without proof, the following: A $K[[\lambda]]$-module ${\cal M}$ is of the form $M_0[[\lambda]]$ if an only if ${\cal M}$ is $\lambda$-adically complete and $\lambda$-torsion free, in wich case $M_0 = {\cal M}/\lambda{\cal M}.$ Trying to prove the ""if"" part, I consider the following map
$$M_0[[\lambda]]\rightarrow {\cal M};\ \ \sum_{j=0}^\infty\lambda^j[x]_j\mapsto\sum_{j=0}^\infty\lambda^jx_j.$$ Then, the series in ${\cal M}$ converges, due to the $\lambda$-adic completeness of ${\cal M},$ for any choice of the representant $x_j$ of $[x]_j,$ yet, I can't prove that the limit is independent of the representant. I suppose that can be shown using the $\lambda$-torsion free property, but then I realised that I don't even have a clear idea of what exactly does that property mean. So, now my question is: What is the definition of a $\lambda$-torsion free $K[[\lambda]]$-module? Also, the map proposed above is the ""natural one"" for me. But I am not sure that is the right one to solve the problem. Perhaps, one I get the right definition of a $\lambda$-torsion free module, I can decide if the map is the needed one.

2002102,Finite abelian group contains an element with order equal to the lcm of the orders of its elements,"I will quote a question from my textbook, to prevent misinterpretation: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and let $m$ be the least common multiple of the orders of its elements. Prove that $G$ contains an element of order $m$. I figured that, if $|G|=n$, then I should interpret the part with the least common multiple as $lcm(|x_1|,\dots,|x_n|)=m$, where $x_i\in G$ for $0\leq i\leq n$, thus, for all such $x_i$, $\exists a_i\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $m=|x_i|a_i$. I guess I should use the fact that $|x_i|$ divides $|G|$, so $\exists k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|G|=k|x_i|$ for all $x_i\in G$. I'm not really sure how to go from here, in particular how I should use the fact that $G$ is abelian.","['finite-groups', 'least-common-multiple', 'abelian-groups', 'group-theory']"

2002112,quotients of amenable groups are amenable,"I want to proof that 
for a discrete group $G$ and $H$ a normal subgroup of $G$ the following holds: $G$ and $H$ are amenable $\Rightarrow$ the quotient $G/H$ is amenable (using one of the definitions below). Def: 1) A discrete group $G$ satisfies the Følner condition if for every finite subset $E\subseteq G$ and for every $\epsilon >0$ there exists a non-empty finite set $F\subseteq G$ such that $$\max\limits_{s\in E}\frac{|F\triangle sF|}{|F|}<\epsilon,$$ where $F\triangle sF$ denotes the symmetric difference of the sets $F$ and $sF$. 2) A discrete group $G$ is called amenable if it satisfies the Følner condition. Def: A discrete group $G$ is called amenable if there is a left invariant mean, i.e. there exists a state $\mu\in S(l^{\infty}(G))$ such that $\mu(g\cdot f)=\mu(f)$ for all $g\in G,\; f\in l^{\infty}(G)$ (where $g\cdot f(h)=f(g^{-1}h)$ for all $h\in H$). I have seen a proof of this fact using other definitions of amenability, but I should know a proof of this fact with one of the above stated definitions. And I only consider discrete groups from now (since I know a proof that these definitions are equivalent if $G$ is discrete). Let $G$ be a amenable group and $H$ an normal amenable subgroup ($H$ is automatically amenable if $G$ is amenable since if you have a left invariant mean $\mu\in S(l^{\infty}(G))$ then you can construct a left invariant mean $\mu\circ \iota \in S(l^{\infty}(H))$, where $\iota :l^{\infty}(H)\to l^{\infty}(\bigsqcup_{i\in I} Hg_i)\; f\mapsto f_i$ with $f_i(hg_i)=f(h)$ for $h\in H$, $\bigsqcup_{i\in I} Hg_i=G$). I want to contruct a left inavriant mean $\tau :l^{\infty}(G/H)\to\mathbb{C}$. However, I'm not sure how to define $\tau$. One of my attempts: Consider the canonical projection $\pi:G\to G/H$ and the induced map $\pi^*:l^{\infty}(G/H)\to l^{\infty}(G),\; \pi^*(f)=f\circ \pi$. Let $\mu \in S(l^{\infty}(G))$ be a left invariant mean and define $\tau (f)=\mu ((\pi^*)^{-1}(f))$. I'm not sure if this definition does make sense.. And I guess to define $\tau$ it is necessary that $H$ is amenable as well.. My question is: How to define $\tau$ correctly?

2002161,Did Euclid really prove the existence of irrational numbers?,"In Proposition 10.10 of Euclid's Elements, Euclid tries to construct a line segment which is incommensurable with a given line segment.  (Two line segments are incommensurable if there exists no common line segment that both are integer multiples of, or equivalently, if the ratio of their lengths does not equal a ratio of natural numbers.) Here's what he says: Let A be the assigned straight line.  It is required to find two straight lines incommensurable, the one in length only, and the other in square also, with A. Set out two numbers B and C which do not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, that is, which are not similar plane numbers , and let it be contrived that B is to C as the square on A is to the square on D, for we have learned how to do this.  Therefore the square on A is commensurable with the square on D.  And, since B does not have to C the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on A to the square on D the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore A is incommensurable in length with D. This proof relies on Euclid's Proposition 10.9 , which states in part that ""squares which do not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number also do not have their sides commensurable in length either"".  So what Euclid does is he chooses two natural numbers B and C such that the ratio of B to C is not equal to a ratio of square numbers.  And then he constructs two squares whose areas are in the ratio of B to C.  And finally he uses Proposition 10.9 to show that the sides of the two squares are incommensurable. But my question is, where does Euclid get the fact that there exists two natural numbers B and C such that the ratio of B to C is not equal to a ratio of square numbers?  Euclid just says ""Set out two numbers B and C which do not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, that is, which are not similar plane numbers"". For those who don't know, two natural numbers $m$ and $n$ are called similar plane numbers if there exist natural numbers $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ such that $m=pq$, $n=rs$, and the ratio of $p$ to $q$ is equal to the ratio of $r$ to $s$, or equivalently the ratio of $p$ to $r$ is equal to the ratio of $q$ to $s$.  Now using Euclid's Proposition 8.18 and Proposition 8.11 , it's easy to prove that the ratio of similar plane numbers is equal to the ratio of square numbers.  But did Euclid ever prove the converse of that statement, i.e. that if two numbers are not similar plane numbers then their ratio is not equal to the ratio of square numbers? Because if Euclid didn't prove that, then he didn't really do the hard number theory work needed to prove that irrational numbers exist. EDIT: I just found out that Euclid stated the result I want him to prove in a Lemma after Proposition 10.9: It has been proved in the arithmetical books that similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, and that, if two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, then they are similar plane numbers. The translator says that the justification of this is ""VIII.26 and converse"".  Here is what Proposition 8.26 : Similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number. But where does Euclid prove the converse, namely that ""if two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, then they are similar plane numbers""?  That's the hard thing to prove.  Euclid claims ""it has been proved in the arithmetical books"", i.e. in Books 7-9, but I can't seem to find such a proof.","['math-history', 'irrational-numbers', 'number-theory', 'euclidean-geometry', 'geometry']"

2002280,"$1729$, Fermat's Last Theorem, and Ramanujan's sums of cubes formula","In the following page in one of Ramanujan's Lost Notebooks, Ramanujan found a formula for sums of cubes such as the famed $1729$. Which can be found in the bottom right hand corner. But also in that page, is a formula: If$$\sum_{n\geq0}a_nx^n=\frac {1+53x+9x^2}{1-82x-82x^2+x^3}\\\sum_{n\geq0}b_nx^n=\frac {2-26x-12x^2}{1-82x-82x^2+x^3}\\\sum_{n\geq0}c_nx^n=\frac {2+8x-10x^2}{1-82x-82x^2+x^3}$$
  Then$$a_n^3+b_n^3=c_n^3+(-1)^n$$ My Question: How would you go about proving this? I did notice one thing: It seemed like Ramanujan was using generating functions. Where given a sequence, you pretend that the numbers are coefficients of a polynomial, and you can then collapse that down into a single expression. For example: The counting numbers $1,2,3,4,5,\ldots$ can be represented as$$1+2x+3x^2+4x^3+\ldots=\frac {1}{(1-x)^2}\tag{1}$$
But if you use generating functions, then you can't substitute that $x$ with anything, which makes them both powerful,  but dangerous. So what would be the point of using generating functions?","['summation', 'algebraic-geometry']"
2002295,"Show that the set $\left\{(x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2: x_1 x_2 = 1, x_1>0 \right\}$ is closed","I would like to show that the set $$S = \left\{(x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2: x_1 x_2 = 1, x_1>0 \right\}$$ is closed and the way I have been thinking about doing that is by showing that it contains its limit points. Hence, we consider a sequence $y_n =  \left(x_{n1}, x_{n2} \right) $ such that $ \lim y_n = y_0$ and try to show that $y_0 \in S$. Now, $ \lim y_n = y_0$ means that $\forall\ \epsilon>0$,  $\exists$ an $N$ such that for $n \geq N$ we have $$\sqrt{\left(x_{n1} - x_{01}\right)^2 + \left(x_{n2} - x_{02}\right)^2 } < \epsilon$$ but since this implies that $|x_{n1}-x_{01}|<\epsilon$, it must be that $x_{01} \neq 0$ as otherwise we would have $x_{n1} < \epsilon$ and so the sequence would not be on the set. Then, as $x_{n2} = \frac{1}{x_{n1}}$, $x_{n1} >0$ and $x_{01} > 0$, in the limit we have $$ x_{02} = \frac{1}{x_{01}}$$ by the rules of the limits. Hence $\left(x_{01}, x_{02} \right) \in S$ and the set is closed. Could you please tell me if my proof is correct? Thank you.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

2002416,Defining the sigma-algebra of events of a probability space,"Suppose we have a sample space of outcomes. How do we define a suitable $\sigma$-algebra of events on this sample space, such that we can then create a good probability measure on the events? Is there a general procedure for doing so?

But I wonder if such an algebra can always to be found while still being sufficiently broad to cover most events we'd care about.

I know nothing (except basics) about complex numbers (like i^2 = -1). 2) self taught Gilbert Strang and Philip N. Klein linear algebra up to SVD both of which i liked very much. 3) Reading on intro to probability by Blitzstein that I like very much myself 4) Also watched MIT lectures on multivariable calculus myself and liked them too. I have browsed questions in here and 3 books that appear everywhere are - Apostol, Spivak, Courant. But Everyone says they are too difficult. Im not sure im ready for those, though I took a glimpse at Apostol - i like him starting from integration because that's my weak spot. Though these books are huge and they require a lot of time - and id like to be able to do 1 book per 6 months possibly in not a very fast tempo. Also, id like to know which exercises to do in those to enforce knowledge. The particular reason im asking this quest is that if I start with the wrong book i might have to start over with another one so id like to hear more recommendations. So, in the light of above facts - can someone suggest maybe some book? Or just give some recommendation. I guess this question might pop up for many stats students or cs students that would like to improve their knowledge of calculus, but are not aimed at becoming mathematicians.","['calculus', 'statistics', 'book-recommendation', 'probability', 'soft-question']"

2002921,When does the tangent line to the sine curve pass through the origin?,"I am trying to find values $a$ and $w$ for which the line $y=ax$ is tangent to the curve $y=\sin(x)$ at $x=w$. One immediate solution is $a=1$ and $w=0$, but I would like $a<0$ and $w\in (\pi,3\pi/2)$, and I am having a hard time finding such a solution. Asking Mathematica doesn't help ( Solve , Reduce , Minimize all say This system cannot be solved ) and asking Google gives me elementary calculus problems. Here is a picture showing such values of $a$ and $w$ exist (and giving an impression of how the problem changes with $a$ changing): It is clear that there is some $a\in(-.3,-.2)$ such that $y=ax$ is tangent to $\sin(x)$, and I could find a numerical approximation, but I want an exact solution. Thought 1: Describe the tangent line to $\sin(x)$ at $(w,\sin(w))$ as $y=\sin(w)+\cos(w)(x-w)$, and find when that intersects the origin. This leads to solving the equation $\tan(w)=w$, seemingly impossible. Thought 2: Given $a$, I can find a spot on the sine curve with slope $a$. Indeed, such a point is $\cos(w)=a$, or $w=\arccos(a)$. Due to the limited range of $\arccos$ and wanting $w\in (\pi,3\pi/2)$, I need $w=2\pi-\arccos(a)$. Now I have to solve $a(2\pi-\arccos(a))=\sin(2\pi-\arccos(a))$, which can be simplified by the periodicity of $\sin$ and knowing $\sin(\arccos(a))=\sqrt{1-a^2}$, but that doesn't help too much. My problem is actually slightly more general, I have the curve $y=\sin(cx)$ for some changing $c$. I know there exists exactly one triple $(a,c,w)$, for $a<0$ and $w\in (\pi/c, 3\pi/2c)$ such that $y=ax$ is tangent to $y=\sin(cx)$ at $x=w$, but I am worried this is a problem that cannot be solved.

2003454,Condition for immersed but not embedded submanifold?,"Claim : an immersed submanifold is not an embedded submanifold if and only if its manifold topology does not agree with the subspace topology. Why I suspect the claim is true : the inclusion map is always injective by definition. Also, since it is a restriction of the identity, its derivative everywhere is just the identity transformation, and thus clearly injective. Thus the inclusion is always a smooth immersion. Therefore the only way the inclusion map could fail to be a smooth embedding is if its image was not homeomorphic to the manifold itself. Since its image always has the subspace topology, the only way it could fail to be a homeomorphism is if the manifold topology were different from the subspace topology. For the other direction we proceed by contraposition. If its subspace topology agrees with its manifold topology, then the inclusion map has to be a homeomorphism. Is this correct? This claim is never made (I think) in Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds , so I am doubtful it is correct, because it seems a lot simpler than his discussion of the topic. Also I was struggling to understand why the inclusion map wouldn't always be an embedding, and the only reason I could think of was that it might not be a homeomorphism onto its image if the topology of the manifold as an ""independent space"" was different from its topology as a subspace. But I don't know if that's actually correct. Namely I don't even know if the claim that the inclusion map is always a smooth immersion is correct (it definitely has to be injective). Definitions: An immersed submanifold is a subset of another manifold that is a topological manifold, and the inclusion map is an injective smooth immersion, where a smooth immersion is a smooth map whose derivative is injective at every point. An embedded submanifold is a subset of another manifold which is a topological manifold and for which the inclusion map is a smooth embedding, which is an injective smooth immersion that is also a homeomorphism onto its image.","['differential-topology', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'proof-verification']"

2004100,Is there always a stable position for a rectangular lawn table?,"It is a common calculus / analysis exercice to give a square lawn table, with legs at the corners, and ask to prove that it is always possible to rotate it so that it stands stably (not necessarily in perfect horizontal), as long as the wobblyness comes from the uneven lawn, not from the legs of the table itself. The proof, which assumes the lawn is suitably nice, uses the intermediate value theorem by rotating the table $90^\circ$ while keeping three legs firmly on the ground and noting that since all that's happened is that the diagonals of the table swapped places, the fourth leg must have passed through the ground at some point. What about a rectangular table? This has the complication that the table only has $180^\circ$ rotational symmetry, so there is no way to rotate it so as to have the diagonals swap position nicely. So, how can we prove that if we keep three legs along the ground as we turn the table around, the last leg must touch the ground at some point? Or is there some different approach that works? We are, of course, making the same assumptions as in the square case about the niceness of the lawn and that the table stands stably on an even floor.","['continuity', 'real-analysis', 'puzzle', 'recreational-mathematics']"

2004194,"Area of ""polygon"" inscribed in circle, whose side lengths form a geometric series","$\{v_0, v_n : n\in \Bbb{N}\}$ are points on the circumference of a unit circle, having the following three properties: The (straight line) distances between neighboring points in the sequence form a convergent geometric series. That is, for all $n>0$, $d(v_n,v_{n+1}) = r\cdot d(v_{n-1},v_n) $ with $r$ a constant ratio for the entire set of verticies, and  $0<r<1$. $\lim_{n_to\infty} d(v_n,v_0) = 0$.  That is, the ""polygon"" formed by these vertices forms a closed shape (in the limit) without having to add a ""last"" side going back to $v_0$. For all $n>0$, the shorter of the two arcs from $v_n$ to $v_{n+1}$ does not contain $v_0$.  That is, the sides go around the circle only once. I want to find the area of this ""polygon"" in terms of the side ratio $r$.  (Although the number of sides needed to close the shape is infinite, one can easily define the area as the limit, as $k$ goes to infinity, of the area formed by the first $k$ sides and an added last side connecting $v_{k-1}$ to $v_0$.) Several things are immediately clear: This area is not defined for $r<\frac12$ because the set of lines cannot from a closed (in the limit) ""polygon"" unless the sum of the lengths of all the sides other than the first is longer than the first side.  So the function $A(r)$ need only be found on the open interval $(\frac12,1)$. For any $r \in( \frac12,1)$, there exists a value of $L_0 \equiv d(v_0,v_1)$ such that the figure exactly closes without overshooting.  $L(r)$ has the property that 
$$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{L}{2}r^n\right) = \pi$$ EDIT For $r$ below about $0.6$, the first arc covers more than half the circle, and the area of the polygon does not include that first ""super-wedge."" In that circumstance, $L(r)$ would have the property that $$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{L}{2}r^n\right) = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{L}{2}\right) $$ However, my numerical fiddling around indicates that you can't satisfy this, and that makes sense since arcsin is concave upwards. $\lim_{r\to\frac12} A(r) =0$ and  $\lim_{r\to 1} A(r) =\pi$.  The former represents almost perfectly retracing the first side along a very short arc that is almost a straight line; the latter represents going around the circle in what is almost a regular inscribed polygon. EDIT The nearly straight line case does not happen; see the edit 
above. I'm also almost sure that for small positive $\epsilon$,  $A(r)$ has a positive second derivative at $r=\frac12 + \epsilon$, and a  negative second derivative at $r = 1-\epsilon$, and that $A(r)$ has just one point of inflection. My question, then, is to find $A(r)$, or failing that, to describe some non-trivial properties of $A(r)$.","['limits', 'trigonometry', 'geometry']"

2004295,Is this module free?,"Recently I was trying to amuse myself by inventing unusual examples of modules which are projective but not free. One of the candidates I came up with led to a question which I don't know how to answer. Consider the following: Let $R$ be the ring of continuous real-valued functions defined on $[-1,1]$. Let $E\subseteq R$ be the set of even functions and let $O\subseteq R$ be the set of odd functions. Since $E$ is a subring of $R$, we can view $R$ as an $E$-module. Unless I am mistaken, $O$ is an $E$-submodule of $R$ and $R$ is isomorphic to $E \oplus_E O$. I can show that $O$ is not a free $E$-module (details below), but I cannot show the same for $R$. So that's my question: is $R$ a free $E$-module? Here's my argument for why $O$ is not a free $E$-module: First of all, notice that no two $f,g\in O$ can be linearly independent over $E$. For if $f,g$ are odd, then $fg$ and $-f^2$ are even, and $(fg)f + (-f^2)g=0$. So if $O$ were free, there would exist a single $f\in O$ such that any $g\in O$ can be written uniquely as $g=hf$, where $h\in E$. In particular, if $g(x)=x$ for all $x$, we see that $f(x)\neq 0$ for $x\neq 0$. Since $f$ is odd, so is $f^{1/3}$. Therefore there exists a continuous even function $h$ such that $f^{1/3}=hf$. But then we have $h(x)=\frac{1}{f(x)^{2/3}}$ for $x\neq 0$. Since $f$ is odd, $f(0)=0$. This contradicts the fact that $h$ is continuous at $0$.","['abstract-algebra', 'modules']"

Problem:  Let $A \in M_{n}(\mathbb{C})$ and $P \in GL_{n}(\mathbb{C})$ such that $AP = -PA$.  Show that $\mathbb{C}^{n} = V_{1} \oplus V_{2}$ where $V_1$ and $V_2$ are subspaces such that $AV_{1} \subset V_2$ and $AV_{2} \subset V_{1}$. For doing this problem, I have made only a few observatios, but don't know how to proceed.  First, every linear transformation over a $\mathbb{C}$-vector space has a Jordan canonical form, so $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ has a Jordan basis.  If $\{\lambda_1,...,\lambda_k\}$ are the distinct eigenvalues, then $\mathbb{C}^{n} = E_{\lambda_1} \oplus ... \oplus E_{\lambda_k}$ where $E_{\lambda_i}$ is the generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_{i}$. If $AP = -PA$, then $A$ is similar to $-A$, so they have the same Jordan canonical form (except possibly for conjugating by a permutation matrix).  In particular, the eigenvalues of $A$ is the same set as the eigenvalues of $-A$.  So if $w \ne 0$ is a generalized eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda$, we have $(A - \lambda I)^{k}w = 0$ for some $k \geq 1$.  Then $(-A + \lambda I)^{k}w = 0$, so $w$ is a generalized eigenvector of $-A$ with eigenvalue of $-\lambda$.  By similarity, $-\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, so there exists $v \ne 0$ linearly independent of the vectors in $E_{\lambda}$ such that $(A + \lambda I)^{l}v \ne 0$.  This says that each $E_{\lambda}$ has an independent $E_{-\lambda}$ in the eigendecomposition of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, whenever $\lambda \ne 0$. I am inclined to say that the decomposition into $V_1$ and $V_2$ must be based on this separation into positive and negative eigenvalues, but $A$-invariance of the eigenspaces (i.e. $AE_{\lambda} \subset E_{\lambda}$ for any $\lambda$) makes me think this won't work.

$$\frac{D^2 v^a}{Dt^2} = - R^a_{bcd} u^b u^c v^d,$$

  linear and bounded. How is this not a counterexample? Define $A_n:c_0\to c_0$ by $$\left(A_nx\right)_m=\begin{cases}

2004662,How to show that a Cauchy sequence of sequences converges,"Let $c_0$ be the space of real-valued sequences $\{x_n\}$ which converge to
zero, equipped with the metric $d(\{x_n\}, \{y_n\}) = sup_n
|x_n − y_n|$. I want to show that the metric space $(c_0, d)$ is complete, in other words every Cauchy sequence converges. I need to show that every Cauchy sequence has a limit, and that that limit actually belongs to $c_0$. Right now I am having trouble with the first part. If we assume that $\{a_n\}$ in $c_0$ is Cauchy, I know by the definition of the metric $d$ that the real valued sequence along the $k^\text{th}$ term of each term (which itself is a sequence of reals) of $\{a_n\}$ is also Cauchy. In other words, the sequence $\{a_n\}$ converges term-wise (since Cauchy sequences in the reals converge), but how do I use that to show the entire sequence converges?","['real-analysis', 'cauchy-sequences', 'convergence-divergence']"

2004758,Double Exponential Function and Growth of the Human Population,"I read a paper: The Hyperexponential Growth of the Human Population
on a Macrohistorical Scale ,Varfolomeyev SD, Gurevich KG, J Theor Biol. 2001 Oct 7;212(3):367-72 doi:10.1006/jtbi.2001.238 In the first part they show that the growth of the human population follows the differential equation: $$\frac{\mathrm dN}{\mathrm dt}=kN^2$$ The solution by simply integrating is $$N(t)=\frac{N_0}{1-kN_0t}$$ which is obviously divergent at $t = 1/kN_0$. Because they are not happy with a divergent function, they look for a better solution and introduce an accelerating function $J(t)$: \begin{equation}\frac{\mathrm dN}{\mathrm dt}=kJ(t)N(t)\tag 1\end{equation} Now they say that if we assume that $J(t)=J_0 e^{k_0t}$, the solution to 1 is $$N(t)=N_0 \exp\left(\frac{k_\textrm{app}}{k_0}\exp(k_0t)\right)\tag 2$$ where $k_0$ is a kinetic parameter of the accelerating function and $k_\textrm{app}$ is a complex parameter including $J_0$. Now they say that by Taylor approximation of $\exp(k_0t)$ to first order, they would get back the divergent function $$N(T) = \frac{N_0}{1-(k_\textrm{app}/k_0)-k_\textrm{app}t}\tag 3$$ My questions: 1) I can solve the differential equation as well, but I do not get $k_\textrm{app}$ to be complex. 2) I do not understand how they get from $(2)$ to $(3)$.

x\mapsto\begin{cases}

2004795,Bijection between Natural numbers and the range of a sequence,"I came across this proof in the 3rd edition of Royden's Real Analysis which I find quite confusing. The problem statement and its proof are as follows. If an infinite set $E$ is the range of a sequence , then $E$ can be put in one-to-one correspondence with $\mathbf{N}$. To do this we define a function $\phi:\mathbf{N} \rightarrow \mathbf{N}$ by recursion. Let $\phi(1)=1$ and define $\phi(n+1)$ to be the smallest value of $m$ s.t. $x_m\neq x_i$ for $i\leq \phi(n)$. Since $E$ is infinite such an $m$ always exists and by the well-ordering principle for $\mathbf{N}$ there is always a least such $m$. The correspondence $n\rightarrow x_{\phi(n)}$ is one-to-one between $\mathbf{N}$ and $E$. I have the following questions and please forgive me if they're dumb (I'm mathematically illiterate). 1) Why doesn't the author just map each natural number to its corresponding element in the sequence, i.e., $1\rightarrow x_1$, $2\rightarrow x_2$, etc., to define a bijection between $\mathbf{N}$ and $E$? 2) The definition of $\phi(n+1)$ is quite confusing. For example, in the sequence $<1,1,2,...>$, would $\phi(3)$ take the value 2 or 4? If it takes the value 4, then the function is not a bijection then, right?

2004798,Moment of inertia for a n sided regular polygon,"It is as simple as the title. We have an area $A_n$ of an homogeneous n-sided polygon with the density of $\rho$.

Obviously $I_n=\frac{\iint_{A_n} r^2dm}{\iint_{A_n}dm}$ So I can use the symmetry of the problem to get to $A_n=4n\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{n}}d\phi\int \rho rdr$ But here is also where i get stuck.

2004849,Eigenvalues for symmetric and skew-symmetric part of a matrix,"Every real matrix $A$ can be decomposed into symmetric and skew-symmetric part. Symmetric matrix has only real numbers as its eigenvalues (including $0$) and skew-symmetric matrix has only imaginary values (also including $0$). Could we infer from separate calculations of eigenvalues for
symmetric and skew-symmetric about eigenvalues for matrix $A$ ? If so then can the same be said about eigenvectors calculated separately for these two parts of matrix and their relevance for eigenvectors of the whole matrix $A$? Edit (after 1 day) If the answer for the questions above is too difficult to obtain in a general case maybe it would be possible to answer for a particular case: why in the case of orthogonal matrices $R$ we can write down:
$EGV(sym(R))+EGV(sk(R))= EGV(R)$ where $EGV$ is here a vector obtained from
respectively ordered values of eigenvalues for symmetric part of $R$,
skew-sym. part of $R$ and full matrix $R$. Example: for 3-D rotation matrix we have ( it's hard to believe that it is just a coincidence) $EGV(sym(R)) =\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta)\\
\cos(\theta)\\
 1
\end{bmatrix}  ,
 EGV(sk(R)) \begin{bmatrix}
i\sin(\theta)\\
-i\sin(\theta)\\
0
\end{bmatrix},
 EGV(R)=\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta)\\
\cos(\theta)-i\sin(\theta)\\
 1
\end{bmatrix}$ Of course it would be better if it were proved starting from general properties of orthogonal matrix without calculating exact values of eigenvalues as I showed in the example above.","['matrices', 'rotations', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'linear-algebra']"

Summation by parts, swapping the order of summation, and approximating $H_k$ by $\log k$ were my best ideas, but I could not get any of them to work.  (Perhaps someone else can?)

Bonus points for proving $A(1,2) = \frac{5}{8} \zeta(3)$ and $A(2,1) =  \zeta(3) - \frac{1}{2}\zeta(2) \log 2$, as those are the other two alternating Euler sums needed to complete my answer. Added : I'm going to change the accepted answer to robjohn's $A(1,1)$ calculation as a proxy for the three answers he gave here.  Notwithstanding the other great answers (especially the currently most-upvoted one, the one I first accepted), robjohn's approach is the one I was originally trying.
