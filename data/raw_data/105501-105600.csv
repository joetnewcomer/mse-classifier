1492097,Unbounded Operator of Finite Rank,"Can one find an example of an unbounded operator on a Banach space whose rank is finite? In particular, let $X, Y$ be two Banach spaces and and $T:X\to Y$ be a linear map between them such that $T(X)\subseteq Y$ is of finite dimension. Is it possible that $T$ is unbounded? Attempt at answer: No: $||T||\equiv \sup(\{||Tv||\,|\,||v||\leq1\})$. Let $T(X)=span(v_1,\dots,v_n)$ for some $(v_i)_{i=1}^n$ fixed vectors in $Y$. Then $||Tv||=||\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i v_i||\leq\sum_{i=1}^n|\alpha_i|||v_i||\leq(\sum_{i=1}^n|\alpha_i|)\max(\{||v_i||\,|\,i\in\{1,\dots,n\}\})$ for some $(\alpha_i)_{i=1}^n$. However, I am not sure how to show this is finite. Somehow one would have to get an estimate on $(\sum_{i=1}^n|\alpha_i|)$ using the fact that $||v||\leq1$. But how to relate $(\alpha_i)_i$ to $v$?","['banach-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
1492187,Differential Equation Math Puzzle,"Dog race: Edit 2: I posted a possible answer below. However, I am unsure how the authors arrived at the solution. Maybe someone can offer an explanation. Four dogs are positioned at the corners of a square ($d= 1m$), chase each other in clockwise direction with the same constant speed . As their target is moving, they will follow a curved path, eventually colliding in the center of the square. (a) Why is the total length of the path just $1 m$? (b) Find and solve a differential equation for the radius $r(\theta)$ in polar coordinates. This is a homework question! I just want hints, no solutions please. The tough part is setting up an equation for the radius i.e for the motion of one of the dogs. I was thinking about an equation similar to that of an archimedean spiral. $$r(\theta)=a+b\theta \space \space \space \text{or} \space \space \space r(\theta)=a\theta^{\frac{1}{n}}$$ However, I have no idea what values $a$ or $b$ should be. Any hints are appreciated. Edit 1: This is my second attempt at a solution: If Dog 1 is positioned at $(r, \theta)$ $\implies$ Dog 2 is positioned at $(r, \theta+\frac{\pi}{2})$ Picture: $$x_1=r \cos (\theta) \\ y_1= r \sin (\theta) \\ \\ \\ x_2=r \cos (\theta+\frac{\pi}{2})=-r \sin(\theta) \\y_2=r \sin (\theta+\frac{\pi}{2})=r \cos (\theta)$$ If these are the two position vectors then the vector joining the two points is my velocity vector. $$\implies \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{r \sin (\theta+\frac{\pi}{2})-r \sin (\theta)}{r \cos (\theta+\frac{\pi}{2})-r \cos (\theta)}=\frac{ \sin (\theta+\frac{\pi}{2})- \sin (\theta)}{ \cos (\theta+\frac{\pi}{2})- \cos (\theta)}=\frac{\cos(\theta)-\sin(\theta)}{-  \sin(\theta)-\cos(\theta)}$$ Am I on the right path?

Doubts: Am I correct in choosing $x_0=1$ ( since the theorem says for every $x_0\in I$ )? If not, how is $x_0$ chosen? If my choice of $x_0$ is wrong, am right in guessing that the observations I made stand with the correct $x_0$?

1492269,Computing explicitly the Riemannian Distance on $GL_n^+$,"$\newcommand{\ep}{\epsilon}$ Let  $GL_n^+$ be the Lie group of invertible $n \times n$ matrices with positive determinant. In particular it's a connected open submanifold of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. Now consider it with the induced metric from $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. (So it's a Riemannian submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$). For clarity, this means endowing $GL_n^+ $ with the pullback metric of the Euclidean metric $e$ along the inclusion $ i:GL_n^+ \to (\mathbb{R}^{n^2},e) $. Explicitly: $g_z(X,Y) =tr(X^TY)$ , where $X,Y \in T_z(GL_n^+)$. Questions: (1) Is there an explicit formula for the Riemannian distance between two matrices $A,B \in  GL_n^+$? Conjecture: The Riemannian distance equals the Euclidean one. Attempted proof: Since $GL_n^+$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$, it follows that it's a totally geodesic submanifold. (That is, all it's geodesics are geodesics in $(\mathbb{R}^{n^2},e)$, i.e they are the usual straight lines in Euclidean space). $GL^+(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is open $\Rightarrow$ for any $A \in GL^+(\mathbb{R}^n)$, there is an Euclidean ball centered around it which is contained in $GL_n^+$. Hence, for all matrices close enough to $A$ their distance from $A$ is just the Euclidean one. (since the straight line beteen them is in our submanifold). Now consider $A,B \in GL_n^+$. Let $\alpha:[0,1] \to GL_n^+$ be the straight line path between them. Then: $$ \det(\alpha(t))=\det(A+t(B-A)) $$ is a polynomial in $t$ of degree $\le n$ . Hence, it has only finitely many zeroes. This implies there are no more than $n$ points $t_i$ where $\alpha(t_i)$ is not invertible. Hence, we only need to show we can make arbitrary small perturbations around each such 'bad' non-invertible matrix. This would imply the Riemannian distance equals the Euclidean one. It would be nice if someone could find a neat argument to show this maneuver is indeed possible. Update: This conjecture is false. The key point (as noted by Jason DeVito and loup blanc) is that the determinant is negative for non-negligible parts of the straight-line path $\alpha$. Now, by continuity argument, any path which approximates too closely the straight path must enter a region of negative determinant. It turns out that the behaviour depends on the number of sign changes of the determinant. Example for a case where the distance is Euclidean (a ""jump"" is possible): take $n=2$,$A,B=\pm Id$. Start with a path from $Id$ to $\begin{bmatrix}\ep & 0 \\ 0 & \ep\end{bmatrix}$. Then go via (1) $t \to \begin{bmatrix}\ep & -t \\ t & \ep\end{bmatrix}$ to $\begin{bmatrix}\ep & -\ep \\ \ep & \ep\end{bmatrix}$ ($t$ goes $0 \to \ep)$ . (2) $t \to \begin{bmatrix}t & -\ep \\ \ep & t\end{bmatrix}$ to $\begin{bmatrix}-\ep & -\ep \\ \ep & -\ep\end{bmatrix}$ ($t$ goes $\ep \to -\ep)$. (3) $t \to \begin{bmatrix}-\ep & -t \\ t & -\ep\end{bmatrix}$ to $\begin{bmatrix}-\ep & 0 \\ 0 & -\ep\end{bmatrix}$ ($t$ goes $\ep \to 0)$ . Now continue with straight line until reaching $-Id$. How much this maneuver cost us? The derivatives of the 3 broken straight paths we took were: $\begin{bmatrix}0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}, Id , \begin{bmatrix}0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$. their norms are $\sqrt 2$. Hence, the total lenght is $\sqrt2 \cdot 4\ep$ which is arbitrarily small, as required. (Also, note that the determinant was always $t^2 + \ep^2 > 0$ so we stayed in $GL_n^+$). (2) Can we compute explicitly for a given $A \in GL_n^+$, it's distance from $SO(n)$? $dist(A,SO(n)) =\underset{X \in SO(n)}{\text{min}} d(A,X)$ ($SO(n)$ is the special orthogonal group and the minimum exists since $SO(n)$ is compact and $d$ is continuous) And who is the minimizer (the closest matrix to $A$ in $SO(n)$)? Is it unique? Note: Right or Left multiplication by elements of $SO(n)$ are isometries of $GL_n^+$ with the induced metric. Thus, $d$ is left (right)-$SO(n)$ invariant. In particular, if $ A = U\Sigma V^T $ is the SVD-dscomposition of $A$, then:
$dist(A,SO(n)) = dist(\Sigma,SO(n)) $ , where $\Sigma$ is a square, diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the (strictly positive) singular values of $A$. So for the question of computing the distance from $SO(n)$ (and the minimizer) is reduced to matrices of this type. (i.e diagonal + positive entries).","['metric-spaces', 'riemannian-geometry', 'matrices']"
1492272,Evaluating an integral - is it a two dimensional beta function? This arises from a variant of Goldbach's conjecture.,"Let $\gamma>0$. I would like a nice way to prove that $$\int_{\begin{array}{c}
0\leq s,t\leq1\\
s+t\leq1
\end{array}}t^{\gamma-1}s^{\gamma-1}(1-t-s)^{\gamma-1}dtds=\frac{\Gamma(\gamma)^3}{\Gamma(3\gamma)}.$$ Edit/Remark: zhoraster's answer along with induction allows one to prove the generalized identity when integrating over the simplex $$\int_{\begin{array}{c}
0\leq t_{i}\leq1\\
t_{1}+\cdots+t_{k}\leq1
\end{array}}t_{1}^{x_{1}-1}\cdots t_{k}^{x_{k}-1}\left(1-\sum_{i=1}^{k}t_{i}\right)^{x_{k+1}-1}dt_{1}\cdots dt_{k}=\frac{\Gamma(x_{1})\Gamma(x_{2})\cdots\Gamma(x_{k+1})}{\Gamma(x_{1}+\cdots+x_{k+1})}
 $$
for any $0<x_i<1$ This integral came about while I was reading through Balog and Friedlander's paper A Hybrid Theorem of Vinogradov and Piatetski-Shapiro. Let $0<\gamma<1$, and let$$P_{\gamma}=\left\{ p\ :\ p=\lfloor n^{1/\gamma}\rfloor\ \text{for some }n\right\} 
 $$ be the set of Piatetski-Shapiro primes. While this set of primes is very sparse, it has many nice properties and it is known that a version of the Prime number theorem holds when $\gamma$ is not too small ( see this paper of Heath-Brown ) $$\sum_{\begin{array}{c}
p\leq x\\
p\in P_{\gamma}
\end{array}}1\sim\frac{x^{\gamma}}{\log x}.
 $$ In the paper of Balog and Friedlander, they prove that for $\gamma$ in some range close to $1$, we have $$\frac{1}{\gamma^{3}}\sum_{\begin{array}{c}
p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}=N\\
p_{i}\in P_{\gamma}
\end{array}}p_{1}^{1-\gamma}p_{2}^{1-\gamma}p_{3}^{1-\gamma}\log p_{1}\log p_{2}\log p_{3}\sim\frac{1}{2}\mathfrak{S}(N)N^{2},
 $$
where $\mathfrak{S}(N)$
  is a particular singular series. Note that this implies that every sufficiently large integer can be written as the sum of three Piatetski-Shapiro primes, which proves a variant of Goldbach's Ternary conjecture for all sufficient large integers. From this they deduce without proof that $$\sum_{\begin{array}{c}
p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}=N\\
p_{i}\in P_{\gamma}
\end{array}}1\sim\frac{1}{2}\frac{\mathfrak{S}(N)N^{3\gamma-1}}{\left(\log N\right)^{3}}\frac{\gamma^{3}\Gamma(\gamma)^{3}}{\Gamma(3\gamma)}.$$
When I applied partial summation, this deduction reduced to evaluating the integral written above.","['special-functions', 'number-theory', 'definite-integrals', 'analytic-number-theory', 'integration']"
1492282,Point circle from pair of straight line equation,"In general, $$x^2+y^2+2gx+2fy+c=0$$ represents a circle with centre at $C(-g,-f)$.
Equations of the form $$ax^2+2hxy+by^2=0$$ represents a pair of straight lines passing through origin. 
But the equation $2x^2+2y^2+xy=0$ represents just a point $(0,0)$. When I came to know that it was not a pair of straight line equation I tried this:
  $$2x^2+2y^2+xy=2(x+y)^2-3xy=0$$
  Using AM GM inequality, $(x+y)^2\ge 4xy$
  $$2(x+y)^2\ge 8xy$$
  $$3xy\ge 8xy$$ 
  Which is only possible if $x=y=0$. But is there an easy way to quickly check if the equation $ax^2+2hxy+by^2=0$ represents a point circle?
After all, I used the above method only after knowing it's not a pair of straight lines.","['geometry', 'circles']"

Can someone explain to me the following: What do we even mean by the information carried by a $\sigma$-algebra? In other words, I can't even understand what we would like this to represent.

1492331,Find slopes of tangent lines where $\frac{dy}{dx}$ has removable discontinuity.,"A colleague of mine wrote a worksheet where she asked students to find the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$, where the points $(x,y)$ are defined by the ""Heart Curve,""
$$(x^2+y^2-1)^3-x^2y^3=0.$$
She asks students about points where the derivative is well-defined, but I wondered about the points where the derivative isn't well-defined. A plot of the graph shows sharp points at $(0,\pm1)$, and seems to be a smooth curve at the points $(\pm1,0)$, yet the derivative is undefined at points where $x=0$ or $y=0$.  At points where $x=0$, there should be VERTICAL tangent lines (I have since ran the zoom in on a point test to find this), and at points where $y=0$ there should be one distinct tangent line. It seems slopes here should be $\pm2$ . I have calculated $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{2xy^3-6x(x^2+y^2-1)^2}{6y(x^2+y^2-1)^2-3x^2y^2},$$
and I feel like there should be a way to remove singularities for $x=0$ or $y=0$ in the expression but I do not know exactly how. I thought about maybe using partial derivatives and L'Hopital's Rule, but not sure.  My goal is to discuss this with students in a single-variable calculus course, so I'd like a solution that doesn't use partial differentiation.","['calculus', 'derivatives']"

1492799,There is a free group $F_2$ in $SO(3)$,"I'd like an exposition of the proof that there is a subgroup of $SO(3)$ isomorphic to $F_2$, the free group on two elements. This is a key step in the proof of the Banach-Tarski paradox . The usual generators chosen for this are rotations about the $x$ and $z$ axes by $\theta=\arccos\left(\frac13\right)$. Wikipedia attempts to describe a proof, but it is too terse for my liking; perhaps someone here can fill in the gaps. Let $a$ be a rotation of $\theta=\arccos\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)$ about the first, $x$ axis, and $b$ be a rotation of $\theta$ about the $z$ axis (there are many other suitable pairs of irrational multiples of $\pi$, that could be used here as well). The group of rotations generated by $a$ and $b$ will be called $H$. 
  Let $\omega$ be an element of $H$ which starts with a rotation on the $z$ axis, of the form $\omega=\ldots a^{k_1}b^{k_2} \ldots b^{n}$ [I think this is trying to say that the shortest word expressing $\omega$ is of the form $xb$ for some word $x$]. It can be shown by induction that $\omega$ maps the point $(1,0,0)$ to $\displaystyle\left(\frac i {3^N}, \frac{j\sqrt 2}{3^N}, \frac k {3^N}\right)$, for some $i,j,k \in \mathbb Z,N \in \mathbb N$. Analysing $i,j$ and $k$ modulo 3, one can show that $j\neq 0$. The same argument repeated (by symmetry of the problem) is valid for the opposite rotation about the $z$ axis, as well as rotations about the $x$ axis. This shows that for any non trivial word $\rho \in H$, then $\rho \neq e$. Therefore, the group $H$ is a free group, isomorphic to $F_2$.

Similarly, $n$ -dimensional Prime Cube of the $2$ nd kind $(b;l_1,l_2,\ldots, l_n)^{+}$ is the set $$(b;l_1,l_2,\ldots, l_n)^{+} = \Bigl\{ b\cdot l_1^{d_1} \cdot l_2^{d_2}\cdots l_n^{d_n} + 1\Bigr\}_{(d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_n)\in\{0,1\}}\tag{2}$$ of $2^n$ distinct prime numbers.

1493009,"Definition of topology...""open in $X$"" does it not involve a metric by definition?","I've been very confused with topology lately, and here's another one that I can't answer myself after spending hours staring at the definition. So, here's the definition I am using $X$ is a set. A topology on X is a set of subsets $\tau$ of $X$ with the following properties Whenever $(U_{i})_{i \in I}$ is a family(finite or not) of subsets of $X$ such that $U_i \in \tau$ , $\forall i \in I$ then $\cup_{i \in I}U_i \in \tau$ Whenever $U_1$ , $U_2 \in \tau$ then $U_1 \cap U_2 \in \tau$ . $\emptyset \in \tau$ and $X \in \tau$ So far so good. But Here's a remark in my notes that confuses me; We call the elements of $\tau$ the open subsets of $X$ . Thus "" $U \in \tau$ "" and "" $U$ is open in $X$ "" mean the same thing. Firstly, ""open subsets"", in my understanding, is that "" $U$ is an open subset of $X$ , iff $\exists$ open ball $B_\epsilon(X)$ of radius $\epsilon >0,  \forall x \in U \subseteq X$ such that $B_\epsilon(X) \subseteq X$ ""
Casually speaking, for every point in this subset, I can find an open ball around it which is always in that subset. But to define an open ball, we need a metric, by definition of a ball, yes?
If the elements of $\tau$ are called the ""open subsets"" of $X$ , then we clearly are talking about the existence of a ball, thus the existence of a metric. But just as in the definition, $X$ is a set, but no where does it say it is a ""metric space""
Is it always assumed that $X$ has some metric with it and we're building a ""topology"" over it? If so, then why do we have something called a ""topology induced by a metric""? If we're always assuming metrics defined on $X$ to create a topology(because, without it, we cannot define ""open"" thus there would be no such thing as ""open subsets""), doesn't that mean every possible topology must be induced by some metric?? I am so confused And, for the remark, it's saying that being a member of $\tau$ is the same as being called an ""open subset"" and ""being open in $X$ "".
But, why? The definition does not mention anything about $U_i$ being open or closed or whatever,can I not take closed subsets of $X$ and still satisfy the $3$ conditions i.e. qualify them as a topology? Please someone help me out here, every time I feel like I understood something, a new question comes up and I feel depressed...Every time I get something, it contradicts with my understanding...",['general-topology']

Then as I see it, there's basically two possible definitions of $\mathrm{cl}(A)$. But, I've never understood why this is true, or why they're the same. Definition 0. For all $a \in \mathbb{X}$, we define that $a \in \mathrm{cl}(A)$ iff for all closed sets $C$ of $\mathbb{X}$, if $C$ includes $A$, then $C$ contains $a$. This is trivially equivalent to either/both of: $\mathrm{cl}(A)$ is the intersection of all closed sets that include $A$. $\mathrm{cl}(A)$ is the least closed set that includes $A$. I really like this approach because it generalizes nicely to other contexts, such as algebra. For example, if $\mathbb{G}$ is a group and $A$ is a subset of $\mathbb{G}$, then the subgroup generated by $A$ can be defined as follows. Denoting this this subgroup $\mathrm{cl}(A),$ we assert that for all $a \in \mathbb{G}$, it holds that $a \in \mathrm{cl}(A)$ iff for every subgroup $H$ of $\mathbb{G},$ we have that if $H$ includes $A$, then $H$ contains $a$. Quite generally, this all makes sense in any closure system , by which I mean a set $X$ equipped with a collection of ""closed sets"" subject to the condition that the intersection of an arbitrary family of closed sets is itself closed. Such things are occasionally called ""generalized topologies."" I'd link to the relevant wikipedia article, but for some reason that article appears to have been deleted. (Sigh.) Anyway, there's another possible definition of $\mathrm{cl}(A)$, at least in the context of ordinary (i.e. non-generalized) topologies. Namely: Definition 1. For all $a \in \mathbb{X}$, we define that $a \in \mathrm{cl}(A)$ iff for each neighborhood $N$ of $a$, the set $N \cap A$ is inhabited. We can find, on this very website and others, proofs of the equivalence between these two notions. However, they tend to either meander around a lot, and/or use notions like ""boundary"" and ""derived set"" that I consider pretty non-fundamental and which therefore, in my opinion, do not belong in a proof of such a fundamental fact. Therefore, I'm looking for a really clean proof that these definitions of ""closure"" are the same. A good answer should provide a proof that: is brief, is clear, avoids the terms boundary/derived set/limit point/isolated point, and establishes the result under minimal hypotheses.

Since $a$ and $x$ are in $[0,1]$, the maximum value of $a+x$ is 2. Take $\delta=\min\{1,\frac{\epsilon}{2}\}$. Then $$0<\vert x-a\vert<\delta\Rightarrow\vert x^2-a^2\vert=\vert x-a\vert\vert x+a\vert<2\vert x-a\vert=2\delta\leq\epsilon$$ I think my logic makes sense but I am unsure about my step involving $\delta$.

The generator of $\mathbb{Z}$ reflects $S^2$ about the equator and translates $\mathbb{R}$ along one unit. I have two questions - What does this action do to $X$? More precisely, what is $X/G$?

AX & \stackrel{\pi}{\longrightarrow} & X/_\sim \\
\uparrow{i} & & \uparrow{j} \\

Quotient top: $V$ is open iff $\pi^{-1}(V)\subseteq X$ is open. Since $\mathcal U$ is open, the inclusion $i$ is an open map. Thus, $\pi^{-1}(V)$ is open iff $i^{-1}(\pi^{-1}(V))$ is open.

Edit: The step marked ($\star$) is the wrong one. $i$ is open and continuous, but that $i^{-1}(\pi^{-1}(V))$ is open does not imply that $\pi^{-1}(V)$ is open.

In Wikipedia, it is said that the quotient space $X/\sim$ together with the quotient map $\pi : X → X/\sim$ is characterized by the the theorem above, which is also called a universal property . I know almost nothing about category theory. The Wikipedia article about universal property says that The concrete details of a given construction may be messy, but if the construction satisfies a universal property, one can forget all those details: all there is to know about the construct is already contained in the universal property. Proofs often become short and elegant if the universal property is used rather than the concrete details. Universal properties define objects uniquely up to a unique isomorphism. Therefore, one strategy to prove that two objects are isomorphic is to show that they satisfy the same universal property. Here are my questions : What does "" $X/\sim$ together with $\pi$ is characterized by the

1493994,Can we describe multiplication on $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ as action on subsets of $n$-element set?,"The symmetric difference between two set $A$ and $B$ denoted $A \triangle B$ is defined as the set $(A - B) \cup (B - A)$ or equivalently $(A \cup B) - (A \cap B)$. Some years ago I was quite excited to find that the set $\mathcal{P}(N)$ of all $2^n$ subsets of an $n$-element set $N$ forms a abelian group under the $\triangle$-operation. Being older and wiser it is easy to see where this group comes from: replacing every subset $A$ of $N$ with its indicator function, that is: by a vector of $n$ zeroes and ones indicating whether or not the first element of $N$ is in $A$, whether or not the second element is etc, we see that taking the symmetric difference of sets corresponds to adding the indicator vectors mod 2. In other words: the group we find is the underlying abelian group of the vector space $\mathbb{F}_2^n$. Now for the question. $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is more commonly written $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ and the reason is that on top of being a vector space it is also a field. In other words: there is a, really beautiful, way of mutliplying these vectors. The question then is: what does this multiplication look like when described in terms of sets? Starting from the 'abstract' field $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ there seem to be many ways and a lot of arbitrary choices involved when picking a way to write the elements as vectors, but perhaps, starting from sets with symmetric differences as addition there is a 'most beautiful way' to add multiplication to the picture? What we want is a second operations on subsets of $N$ that distributes over $\triangle$ and of course an example is not hard to find: intersection will do. But looking at the vector picture again we that this gives the stupid pointwise multiplication of vectors. This is definitely not the field multiplication as it produces zero (the empty set) whenever we try to 'multiply' two disjoint subsets. So my question is: what 'even more' beautiful set operation corresponds to the multiplication in $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ when letting it act on all subsets of a set of $n$ elements? EDIT: as requested in the comments I will say something about the small cases. First for $n = 1$ we note that in this very small case pointwise and field multiplication coincide, so we can use the intersection. Thinking about intersections we note that (if nothing else) the idea of taking the field element 1 to be the full set $N$ might be something to take with us from this example to the larger cases with fancier set operations. After all, 1 is the only element besides 0 we know that is present and easily recognizable in every field, and similarly the full set is the only subset besides the empty set which is equally easy to identify in all cases. Running with $1 = N$ leaves us with pretty much only one possibility in the the $n = 2$ case: any singleton set squared gives the other singleton set while their product equals 1 (i.e. all of $N$). Writing $c: \mathcal{P}(N) \to \mathcal{P}(N)$ for the complement-operator this 'multiplication' can be written as $$A * B = c^{|A||B|}(A \cap B).$$
this formula looks pretty nice, but already breaks down in the $n = 1$ case. If we take the more agnostic stand point that $A * B = c^{f(A, B)}(A \cap B)$ for 'some' function $f$ we still get nowhere as this formula is bound to give elements satisfying $x^3 = 1$ while we want all elements to satisfy $x^{2^n - 1} = 1$, with at least one $x$ not satisfying $x^k = 1$ for any $k < 2^n -1$. However, if there is any good idea in this $n = 2$ case to take with us to higher cases (similar to the idea of taking 1 to be the full set from the n = 1 case) then my bet would be it is the idea of taking $A^{-1}$ to be the complement of $A$. UPDATE: nope. Taking $A^{-1}$ to be the complement of $A$, (that is: $1 + A$ in the field view) for all elements $A$ leads to a contradiction in the $n = 3$ case. We have to think of something else.","['boolean-algebra', 'elementary-set-theory', 'finite-fields']"

Rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb?,"Conjecture: The optimal way to divide 3-space into pieces of equal volume with the least total surface area is the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb. Reasoning: ""(The rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb) is the Voronoi diagram of the face-centered cubic sphere-packing, which is the densest possible packing of equal spheres in ordinary space."" (Wikipedia) This resembles very closely how the regular hexagonal grid emerges from densest circle packing. (Also in real honeycombs, where the rhombic dodecahedron appears on one side of cells.)(see wiki:Honeycomb) Furthermore the kissing number in 2-space is 6 and in 3-space it's 12. The ""flat side"" (edge->surface) should be where the objects meet. Therefore we expect a kind of dodecahedron. Question: Is my conjecture right? If yes, how can I proof it?

1494178,Understand the corrispondence between rational maps and linear systems.,"A key fact in ""birational geometry"" (on $\mathbb C$ ) is the following theorem: Let S be a surface. Then there is a bijection between the following
sets: (i) {rational maps $\phi:S-\rightarrow\mathbb P^n $ such that $\phi(S)$ is contained in no hyperplane}. (ii) {linear systems on $S$ without fixed part and of
dimension $n$ }. The statement of the theorem is taken from the Beauville's book on algebraic surfaces, but the result is true even if we replace $S$ with a generic non-singular projective variety. On Beauville's book there is a quick proof (only for surfaces), and unfortunately most of the details are not covered. I have understood how the bijective correspondence is constructed, but I have missed some things. For example: $1)$ Why do we require that $\phi(S)$ is not contained in any hyperplane? $2)$ Let $P$ be a linear system on $S$ and let $x\in S$ be a closed point. why the set $$\{D\in\text{Div}(S)\,: x\; \text{is in the support of}\;D\}$$ is a hyperplane of $P$ ? So my request is the following: I'd like to see a complete proof of the theorem for the general case (not only for surfaces). So, I need a direct proof here on ME or alternatively a reference. If there will be two distinct answers, one with a reference and one with a proof, I clearly will accept the proof.","['surfaces', 'birational-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'reference-request']"
