670930,Product of symmetric positive definite matrices,"I was asked the following question: Let $A,B \in \mbox{Mat}_n(\mathbb R)$ be symmetric positive definite matrices. Show that $AB$ does not have negative eigenvalues. My answer I'm getting something very weird. According to my answer, $AB$ has to be positive definite. which is weird because we don't know that $AB$ is symmetric. $B$ is symmetric so there is a basis $v_1,...,v_n$ of eigenvectors such that $Bv_i=\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_i>0$ for all $i$, and $<v_i,v_j>=0$ when $i\neq j$ let's look at $<ABx,x>$ where $x$ is some vector in $\mathbb R^n$ $<ABx,x>=<AB\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i,\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i> = <AB\alpha_1 v_1,\alpha_1 v_1>+<AB\alpha_2 v_2,\alpha_2 v_2>+...+<AB\alpha_n v_n,\alpha_n v_n> = \alpha_1 ^2 \lambda_1<Av_1,v_1>+\alpha_2 ^2\lambda_2<Av_2,v_2>+...+\alpha_n ^2 \lambda_n<Av_n,v_n>$ obviously for all $i$ $\alpha_i ^2$ is positive. Because $B$ is positive definite, for all $i : \lambda_i >0$. Because $A$ is positive definite, for all $i: <Av_i,v_i>$ is positive. so overall, for all $i: \alpha_i ^2 \lambda_i <Av_i,v_i>$ is positive. So we got that $<ABx,x>$ is larger than zero for any vector $x$, and so I infer that $AB$ is positive definite. And so it doesn't have negative eigenvalues. But how can we say that it's positive definite if it's not symmetric? I did something wrong I'm sure.","['positive-definite', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'positive-semidefinite']"
670933,Cardinality of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$,"What is the cardinality of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients?
It seems like it is countably infinite: Define the height of a polynomial to be the sum of the absolute value of its coefficients and its degree $-1$. There are only finitely many polynomials of each height. We can list each polynomial, starting with height $-1$, $0$, and then $1$, etcetera, ordering the polynomials of each height by their constant term, and moving to the linear term if they are equal. It seems as though this is an ordering of the polynomials with integer coefficients, so the set is countably infinite. However, each polynomial can be expressed as an infini-tuple. Then a diagonal argument shows that there is a polynomial that is not in the list. How can this be?",['elementary-set-theory']

670998,"$H^{-1}(\Omega)$ given an inner product involving inverse Laplacian, explanation required","Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain and define $V=L^2(\Omega)$ and $H=H^{-1}(\Omega)$. Endow $H$ with the inner product
$$(f,g)_{H} = \langle f, (-\Delta)^{-1}g \rangle_{H^{-1}, H^1}$$
where $(-\Delta)^{-1}g = \tilde g$ is the solution of $-\Delta \tilde g = g$  on $\Omega$, $\tilde g= 0$ on $\Gamma$. In Lions' Quelques methodes... on page 192, he uses this set up to deal with a PDE of the form
$$u_t - \nabla \cdot (|u|\nabla u) = f.$$ Now, we have a Hilbert triple $V \subset H \subset V^*$. I remember that we identify $H$ with its dual, but not $V$ with its dual. But $V^*= (L^2)^* = L^2$. So how should I think of the dual of $V$? I ask because Lions then says the following: ...standard theory from before tells us there is a unique $u \in L^2(0,T;V)$ with $u_t \in L^2(0,T;V^*)$ such that
  $$(u'(t), v)_H + a(u(t),v) = L(t)(v)$$
  where $a(u,v) = \frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega |u|uv$ (and $L(t)$ is given but it's not relevant here). My question is, why does Lions write $(u_t,v)_H$ and not $\langle u_t, v \rangle_{V^*,V}$? We only know that $u_t \in L^2(0,T;V^*)$, don't know that it's in $L^2(0,T;H)$. But if we did identify $V^* = L^2$, then we get $L^2 \subset H^{-1} \subset L^2$ (but this would mean $L^2=H^{-1}$!!!), and the duality pairing becomes the $H^{-1}$ inner product as defined above so it kinda makes sense. Finally, any references to other work where PDEs are tackled with the pivot space equal to $H^{-1}$ with the inverse Laplacian are hugely appreciated.

671017,Questions about Bayesian inference,"From Wikipedia The prior distribution is the distribution of the parameter(s) before any data is observed, i.e. $p(\theta \mid \alpha )$. ... The sampling distribution is the distribution of the observed data conditional on its parameters, i.e. $p(\mathbf {X}\mid \theta )$ .
  This is also termed the likelihood,... The marginal likelihood (sometimes also termed the evidence) is the distribution of the observed data marginalized over the
  parameter(s), i.e. $$p(\mathbf {X}\mid \alpha )=\int_{\theta
    }p(\mathbf {X}\mid \theta )p(\theta \mid \alpha )\operatorname
    {d}\!\theta .$$ The posterior distribution is the distribution of the parameter(s) after taking into account the observed data. This is
  determined by Bayes' rule, which forms the heart of Bayesian
  inference: $$
        p(\theta \mid \mathbf {X},\alpha )={\frac {p(\mathbf {X}\mid\theta )p(\theta \mid \alpha )}{p(\mathbf {X} \mid \alpha )}}\propto p(\mathbf

671029,Finding the metric of a surface embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$,"I have a problem about finding the metric of a surface defined by $x=\rho\cos\varphi,\ y=\rho\sin\varphi,\ z=\rho^2$, embedded into $\mathbb{R}^3$, where $ds^2=dx^2+dy^2+dz^2$. I have literally no idea how to do this. Worse perhaps, is I find the expression $ds^2=dx^2+dy^2+dz^2$ hopelessly meaningless, because I can't understand any precise meaning of $ds, dx$ etc. I understand it's supposed to capture the nature of the pythagorean theorem as used to calculate distances in 3D and generalise it, but what exactly $dx$ is precisely escapes me. ""A small distance"" or ""A small change"" don't do it for me; it's apparently being used to define distances so calling it a small distance is clearly circular, and what exactly makes a small change? How do you calculate with such quantities? How do you know how the expression for $ds^2$ is going to change when you change coordinates? (These are questions I feel I really shouldn't have to ask, but my lecturer is very sporadic, unclear, and provides very few resources, and feel quite stuck.) I am looking for an explanation or some resources to enlighten me as to what I should understand by these quantities/expressions, and some hopefully some help with how I would go about finding the metric of the paraboloid above.

671032,Show that $f :X \to Y$ is injective iff $f^{-1}f(A))=A$ for all subsets $A$ of $X$ (proof checking),"Show that $f :X \to Y$ is injective iff $f^{-1}f(A))=A$ for all subsets $A$ of $X$. Now I wrote a proof for this theorem and my question is firstly, is it correct? Secondly, since this is my first experience in writing such proofs, is it clear and concise enough? It feels quite unclear to me. So any tips and help would be appreciated. Here is my proof: First we assume that  $f$ is injective, i.e. $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ implies that $x_1=x_2$. Now This means that $\forall y\in f(A) \exists\text{ a unique } x\in X | f(x)=y$. For each element in $x\in X$ we thus have $f^{-1} f(x) = x$. Thus we have for all subsets $A$ of $X$ that $f^{-1}f(A))=A$. We can see this results is not true when $f$ is not injective, or when each element $y$ in $f(A)$ may not have unique inverse. In this case $f^{-1}(y)$ is not defined. To show the opposite direction we assume that $f^{-1}f(A))=A$ for all subsets of $X$. Then in particular for all singleton sets $A=\{x \}$ we have $f^{-1}f(x))=x$. Now when $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ we may apply the inverse mapping to each side to obtain $f^{-1}f(x_1))=f^{-1}f(x_2))$. By the hypothesis this reduces to $x_1=x_2$ and we have shown that $f$ is injective.

671066,Zeros diagonal element of a semidefinite matrix leads to zeros row/column. Why?,"I have a similar problem as in this question. In short words: Assume a square, positive semidefinite matrix $A\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}$.
Show that if a diagonal element of $A$ is zeros then the corresponding row and column are all zero. The answer in the other question suggests to look at the definiteness of the matrix
$$ B = \begin{pmatrix} a_{i,i} & a_{i,k} \\ a_{k,i} & a_{k,k} \end{pmatrix}$$
where $a_{k,k}=0$ and both $a_{i,k}$ and $a_{k,i}$ are non-zero. I tried to proof this fact but I am unsure if I did it correctly.
Also there might be a better/quicker/clearer way to do it.
Would you mind going through it and give me your oppinion? If one calculates the eigenvalues we get 
$$\lambda_{1,2} = \frac{a_{i,i}\pm\sqrt{a_{i,i}^2+4a_{i,k}^2}}{2}.$$
Thus we know that $B$ is indefinite as $\sqrt{a_{i,i}^2 + 4a_{i,k}^2} > \lvert a_{i,i} \rvert$. If $A$ is positive semidefinite then $x^T A x \geq 0$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$ must hold.
Assume a matrix $C\in\mathbb R^{n \times 2}$ that is zeros except for the elemets $c_{i,1}=c_{k,2}=1$.
This must also hold true for the special case that $x=Cy$ with $y\in\mathbb R^2$.
We obtain $y^T C^T A C y = y^T B y$ means that $C^T A C$ is indefinite.
This is a contradiction to the assumption that $A$ is positive semidefinite. Is there an (easy) way to extend this to block matrices?","['matrices', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'block-matrices', 'analysis']"

The general pattern I've seen which determines into which camp any given mathematician falls is how 'good' they want their category of rings to be. Those who want zero morphisms and want to be able to define the kernel of a morphism categorically often opt to go without unity. There is a printed semi-famous comment about this problem in the Radical Theory of Rings by Gardner and Wiegandt: This is where my question begins. I have searched for why the category of Rings (with unity) does not have infinite coproducts. And basically everywhere that comments on it does not prove that there is no object in Ring which satisfies the universal property of a coproduct for an infinite family . What they do explain is that the thing we would expect to be the coproduct (namely the set-theoretic direct sum with pointwise addition and multiplication) is not a coproduct in Ring . I have attempted to prove the non-existence of such an object for myself but have not gotten far. One would have to show that either every infinite family of rings cannot all be embedded in another ring; or in the case that there is such an object, there is always a 'smaller' (non-isomorphic) object in Ring which has the same property. Thus my question is can someone prove to me that Ring (the category of rings with unity and unity preserving homomorphisms) does not have infinite coproducts?

Any open set in $[0,1]$ that doesn't contain one of $\{\frac 1n : n \in \mathbb N \cup \infty\}$ is unchanged by the quotient operation - but any open set that contains one of these points then contains all of them, and in fact contains every point in the interval close enough to $0$. My naive guess is that this space is homeomorphic to the Hawaiian earring - each $[\frac 1{n+1}, \frac 1n]$ becomes identified with a circle, and these become ""increasingly smaller"" as $n$ decreases (this is topologically nonsense, but I'm not sure how to word it in a way that's not, if this is even possible). Am I right in my guess? If so, how would I go about proving the existence of a homeomorphism?","['general-topology', 'quotient-spaces']"

672092,Can we use a sum of residues to develop an asymptotic expansion for this unknown function?,"In the course of solving a particular physical problem, I have derived a relationship between two unknown functions:
$$ f(s) = \frac{s \sinh{\frac{\pi s}{2}}}{2 \pi i \beta} \int_{-c- i \infty}^{-c+i\infty} X(\nu) \ \Big(\frac{2}{\beta a}\Big)^\nu \ \Gamma\Big(\frac{1}{2}(\nu + i s)\Big) \Gamma\Big(\frac{1}{2}(\nu - i s)\Big) \ d\nu$$
The two functions $f(s)$ and $X(\nu)$ are unknown and $1>c>0$ specifies the vertical line along which we integrate . The two parameters $\beta$ and $a$ can be tuned such that their non-dimensional combination is either very large or very small. I am hoping to use this large/small parameter to develop some asymptotic expansion using a sum of residues. Simply getting an algebraic relationship in certain limits between the two functions could be helpful. Although $X(\nu)$ is unknown, I do know a number of results about its structure in the complex plane: 1) It decreases exponentially along vertical lines as you move away form the real axis 2) $X(\nu)$ is meromorphic in the whole complex plane with simple poles at (and only at) $\nu = u_p +n$ where $n,p \in \mathbb{N}$ and the $u_p$ satisfy $u_p \sin{\frac{\pi u_p}{2}} + 1=0, Re(u_p)\ge0$ 3) $X(\nu)$ decreases factorially in the positive real direction along horizontal lines and increases factorially in the negative real direction. My intuition says that we can close the given integration contour and then argue either from point 1) or from the small/largeness of $\beta a$ that the closure of the contour has a vanishingly small contribution (depending on exactly how we close; I have been using box contours). The results I am getting though are not consistent with previous numerical and approximate results I have obtained, which I am very confident in. The fact that the gamma functions and $X(\nu)$ can have poles that coincide has me stumped. This occurs because almost all of the $u_p$ are purely real, but $u_0$ is purely imaginary and so if $ s = -i u_0$ the gamma functions and $X(\nu)$ have overlapping poles. How can I systematically approximate this integral as a sum over the residues, given the information provided above?","['residue-calculus', 'approximation', 'complex-analysis']"

I'm pretty sure there are many other examples. Question: How does understanding the maximal subgroups of a group help us in understanding the structure of the group? Why should we care about maximal subgroups? This question is of course a bit vague. What I'm looking for is motivation and examples of applications. For example, I can see how the classification of finite simple groups (CFSG) is useful and interesting in group theory: every group is made up of simple groups (Jordan-H√∂lder), and CFSG is a very powerful tool for proving things. Many theorems have been proven with the following strategy: Step 1: Prove that a minimal counterexample is a finite simple group. Step 2: Check the theorem for each family of finite simple groups. So the importance of CFSG is clear. What I don't understand currently is why a group theorist would care about maximal subgroups or classifying them.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Wikipedia has some bounds on the $n$th prime number, and assuming that they're correct, we eventually have (where the $^2$ indicates iteration): $$p_n<n\log n + n\log^2n=n\log (n\log n)$$ Now, we have eventually $n < n\log n < n^2$, the left inequality as $\log n > 1$ and the right because $\log n < n$, and both logs and $n$th roots are increasing, so we conclude: $$\sqrt[n]{\log n} < \sqrt[n]{\log(n\log n)} < \sqrt[n]{\log(n^2)}=\sqrt[n]2\sqrt[n]{\log n}$$ And as $1<\log n<n^2$, we have $\sqrt[n]{\log n}\to 1$ and so $\sqrt[n]{\log(n\log n)}\to 1$. So the series with $n$th coefficient $n\log (n\log n)$ has radius of convergence $1$. Since it's coefficient-wise greater than the series with prime coefficients, the latter has radius of convergence at least $1$. Is this reasoning correct? Did I interpret the upper bound on $p_n$ correctly? (ie. is it exact, like I think it is, or is it just asymptotically true in some sense?)

Show that $$f^\prime(0) = f^{\prime\prime}(0) = 0.$$ My attempt. First, let us show that $f(0) = 0$ . Since $f$ is twice differentiable, it is also continuous. Suppose $f(0) = k$ where $k \ne 0$ . Then there is a $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $x \in (-\delta,\delta)$ , $f(x) \in (k/2,3k/2)$ . But $f(2^{-n}) = 0 $ for all positive integer values of $n$ . Thus we have a contradiction as no $\delta$ works for $f$ to be continuous at $x=0$ . Thus $f(x) = 0$. $f(x)$ is differentiable , thus $f^\prime(x)$ is continuous. Suppose $f^\prime (0) = m$ such that $m\neq0$ , then by continuity of $f^\prime(x)$ there is a $\delta$ such that whenever $x \in (-\delta,\delta)$ , $f^\prime(x) \in (m/2,3m/2)$ . Choose an $N$ such that 
$2^{-N} < \delta$  . Now, $\int_{x=0}^{1/2^N} f^\prime(x) = f(2^{-N}) - f(0) = f(2^{-N})$ (I am confused whether this integral exists or not ,as in if $f^\prime(x)$ is integrable or not in the interval I am using) . Now $\int_{x=0}^{1/2^N} f^\prime(x) > m/2(1/2^N)$ as the integral would be greater than the rectangle formed using a lower bound for the value of $f$ in the interval. Thus  $\int_{x=0}^{2^{-N}} f^\prime(x) > 0$ and thus $f(2^{-N}) > 0$ but this is a contradiction as $f(2^{-N}) = 0$ by the function definition. Thus we have a contradiction and thus, $f^\prime(0)$ can't be non-zero. We can proceed similarly to prove that $f^{\prime\prime}(0) = 0$ . Is my approach correct, is there a better way to prove it ?

What is the expected amount of time that passes before ABRACADABRA is spelled? Standard Solution: Suppose that, before every keystroke is made, a gambler enters and wagers $\$1$ on the next keystroke being an A fairly (so that if the keystroke is indeed an A, then the payoff is $\$26$). If the keystroke is an A, the gambler stays and wagers everything (in this case $\$26$) on the next letter being B, and so on. If the gambler ever loses a wager, then it leaves. Now let‚Äôs analyze what happens when ABRACADABRA is finally spelled out. The gambler who kept making correct wagers all the way through won $\$ 26^{11}$. But another gambler who got in on the second ABRA won $\$ 26^4$, and a third gambler who got in on the final A got $\$26$. Hence the total payoff is $\$ 26^{11}+\$26^4+\$26$. But all the wagers are fair, and the house gets $\$1$ on every turn from the new gambler, so the expected time before ABRACADABRA is spelled is $26^{11}+26^4+26$. My question:
What if the strategy of the gamblers changes?
In the ""standard solution"" of the problem each gambler first bet on A, then on B, and so on...
If the new gambler looks at the sequence of past letters and wagers $\$1$ on the NEXT USEFUL LETTER, why the game is not fair anymore?
In this case, if the last letters are ""..ABRACA"" the new gambler bets on D instead of A.

I note, that (a(x) mod const)' ~ a'(x) , (c(x) mod c(x))' = 0 , but still I can't conclude form of desired right hand side (a(x) mod b(x))' -> ? function from these borderline cases (maybe dimensional method or method of indefinite coefficients in some form is applicable, but I have not an intuitions of how). What is the generalized (in sense of continuity) form of remainder derivative? I mean a remainder function as presented on x86/x86-64 architectures ( FPREM and FPREM1 ).",['derivatives']
672612,$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}$ Notation Explanation please?,"I know how to derive, I know how to integrate. I know what to do when I see $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}$ and such but what does it really mean? I know it means something like derive in terms of $x$ , but whats the difference between $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}$ ? If someone could give me an explanation in layman's terms that would be very helpful as this has always perplexed me. Basically, what's that $\mathrm{d}$ mean?",['calculus']
672619,Vector Delta Function Identity,"I'm trying to prove the the vector extension of the identity 
\begin{equation} 
1 = \int \left|\sum_i\frac{ \partial  g  }{ \partial a }\big| _{a =a _i} \right| \delta ( g ( a ) ) da
\end{equation} 
where the sum is over all the zeros of $g$. The vector extension is:
\begin{equation} 
1 = \left( \prod _{i =  1 } ^n  \int d a _i \right) \delta ^{ ( n ) } \left( {\mathbf{g}} ( {\mathbf{a}} )  \right) \det \left( \frac{ \partial g _i }{ \partial a _j } \right) 
\end{equation}
where ${\mathbf{g}}$ and $ {\mathbf{a}} $ are $n$ dimensional vectors. This identity is used in Quantum Field Theory by Peskin and Schroeder (pg. 295). I'm a physics graduate student and I don't know much formal mathematics.  Any help on how to prove this would be greatly appreciated.","['multivariable-calculus', 'dirac-delta', 'special-functions', 'integration']"
672635,Trying to solve an odd equation minimum.,"Here is a math puzzle I've been working on - The set-up - I am a dog, 50 feet from the water. A rubber duck is in the water 50 feet from shore and 140 feet to my right. This makes a triangle base of 140 ft, height 100 ft. I can run 30fps on land, 4fps in water. What is the fastest I can get to the duck? Given the only real choice is to vary the point he hits the water, I have the image showing that point, and how it produces two right triangles. So we have this equation to minimize. $y=\frac{\sqrt{\left(2500+x^2\right)}}{30}+\frac{\sqrt{\left(2500+\left(140-x\right)^2\right)}}{4}$ Graphing this produces the conclusion that at X= 133.71, Y= 17.357. I got this far, but manipulating to get rid of radicals sent me down a rabbit hole. Disclosure, a high school junior came to me with this problem. If the solution requires calculus, I'd love to see the method, but the students that had this problem were not that advanced. (I'd welcome a better title for this problem)",['algebra-precalculus']
672646,"A die is thrown five times, what is the probability that you get 20 as the sum of the values","This is supposed to be a Inclusion-Exclusion problem. We have $6^5=7776$ different results. Now, with the Inclusion-Exclusion principle i resolve the number of solutions for the equation: $d_1+d_2+d_3+d_4+d_5=20  , 1 \leq d_i \leq 6 ,\forall 1 \leq i \leq 5$ That, i think, is equivalent to resolve: $d_1+d_2+d_3+d_4+d_5=15  , 0 \leq d_i \leq 5 ,\forall 1 \leq i \leq 5$ This is: $\binom{19}{15}-\binom{5}{1} \binom{13}{9}+\binom{5}{2} \binom{7}{3}=651$ So mi answer is: $\frac{651}{7776}$. However, the ""correct answer"" is: $\frac{116}{7776}$. Whats the problem with mi reasoning? EDIT I found the solutions for my problem in the book, the result is: $\frac{651}{7776}$. I was right, but the solution from mi teacher was wrong. Thats why the confusion.","['inclusion-exclusion', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
672665,Are there real algebras that don't have rational structure constants?,"Take a finite dimensional associative algebra $A$ over the reals. Fix a basis $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n\}$. The multiplication is completely specified by specifying structure constants $c^{ij}_k$ defined by the following equation:
$$x_i \cdot x_j = \sum_k c^{ij}_k x_k \quad\forall i, j$$
Of course, the structure constants depend on the choice of basis. My question is:
Are there algebras such that no choice of basis leads to structure constants that are all rational? My conjectured example would be the algebra spanned by two variables $a$ and $b$, and relations $a^2 = a, ab = ba = b, b^2 = \sqrt{2}a$, but I couldn't prove it yet. Note: One could also ask ""integer"" instead of ""rational"", this is equivalent.",['abstract-algebra']
672693,Integral asymptotic expansion of $\int_0^{\pi/2} \exp(-xt^3\cos t)dt$ as $x \to \infty$,"I have the integral
$$I(x)=\int_0^{\pi/2}\exp(-xt^3\cos t)dt$$
and I want to derive the first two terms in the asymptotic expansion for $x\rightarrow \infty$, which should give me
$$\frac{1}{3x^{1/3}}\Gamma(1/3)+\left(\frac{1}{6}+\frac{8}{\pi^3} \right)\frac{1}{x}+\dots$$ Using the Laplace Method as stated here ,
I get only one term so my idea was to use partial integration, which gives me $$\pi/2-\int_0^{\pi/2} \left[ \exp(-xt^3\cos t)\,\, t\,\,(xt^3\sin(t)-3xt^2\cos(t)) \right] dt$$","['asymptotics', 'integration', 'laplace-method']"
