686384,Interpretation of the Argument Principle,"Recall that the argument principle states that given a meromorphic function $f$ and a compact region $K \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ whose boundary determines a simple contour and on which $f$ has no singularities, then: $$ \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial K} \frac{f'(w)}{f(w)}dw = (N(Z) - N(P))$$ where $N(Z)$ and $N(P)$ refer to the number of zeroes and poles $f$ has in the interior of the compact region. I understand the statement and proof of the theorem, but I am a bit unclear as to why the contour integral of the logarithmic derivative is interpreted as the change in argument of $f$ along the simple contour $\partial K$. I realize that $\frac{d}{dz} \log{f(z)} = \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}$, so I can certainly understand why we would consider the quantity $$\frac{1}{i} \int_{\partial K} \frac{f'(w)}{f(w)}dw$$ to measure the change in argument of $f$ along the contour if the contour is closed (since then the real part of the logarithm would vanish, so this quantity would indicate the change of argument). However, too many times I have encountered teachers/websites/authors refer to $$\int_{\gamma} \frac{f'(w)}{f(w)}dw$$ as the change of argument of $f$ even when $\gamma$ is not stated to be a closed contour. And this is precisely why I doubt my understanding of what's going on here. Is there something obvious that I'm overlooking?",['complex-analysis']
686400,What is the motivation for semidirect products?,"I haven't the slightest idea why (inner or outer) semi-direct group products are an interesting construction.

They're a very simple construction, and showing that a group decomposes into that structure is a very strong statement. But the outer semi-direct product construction seems totally arbitrary and bizarre. What's the intuition, here?","['group-theory', 'semidirect-product']"

686430,Increasing/Decreasing Sequence of Events Intuition,"having trouble moving from the concept of increasing/decreasing sequence of real numbers to increasing/decreasing sequence of events.  I have no problem with this concept regarding real numbers but events is a bit abstract. My question is could someone provide any real-life examples of increasing/decreasing sequences of events and not in terms of a mathematical definition which I already know. For example, suppose we have a sequence of coin tosses and we denote event An as the event of getting heads of the nth coin toss.  Is the reason why this sequence is an increasing sequence of events is because the indicator function of the event is increasing?  What causes a sequence to be classified as increasing/decreasing? Again, not looking for a mathematical definition of why or why not an event sequence is increasing/decreasing but examples and intuition that I can't seem to find in any probability book.

686463,Show that $\alpha$ is a bijection.,"Let $X$ be a set and consider the function, $\alpha : \mathcal P \left({X}\right) \rightarrow \mathcal P \left({X}\right)$ such that for all $S \in \mathcal P \left({X}\right), \alpha (S) = X \backslash S$. Show that $\alpha$ is a bijection. What is $( \alpha \circ \alpha) (S)$ for any $S \in \mathcal P \left({X}\right)?$ My attempt: We need to prove that $\alpha$ is not a bijection. Suppose that $\alpha$ is a surjection. Definition 5.4.1 states that a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ with the property $(\forall Y \in Y)( \exists \in X ) [f(x) = y ]$ is a surjection of $X$ onto $Y$. $$\forall T\in \mathcal P(X)\ \exists S\in \mathcal P(x)\quad  X\setminus T = S$$ There is a subset in $X$ that is complement for $T$. We know that $S$ is in $P(X)$ because $S$ must be a subset of $X$. By complementing both sides, we have: $$\forall T \in\mathcal P(X)\ \exists S\in\mathcal P(S) \quad (X\setminus T)^C=S^C$$ Then, we intersect both of them with $X$. $$\forall T\in\mathcal P(X)\ \exists S\in\mathcal P(S) \quad  X\cap (X\setminus T)^C=X\cap  S^C$$ For, $$X\cap(X\setminus T)^C = X\cap(X\cap T^C)^C = X\cap(X^C\cup T)= (X\cap X^C)\cup (X\cap T)= T$$ By Proposition 3.3.5(i), $$X\cap  S^C = X \setminus S$$ We have proven that $\alpha$ is a surjection. Suppose $\alpha$ is not an injection. Definition 5.4.5 states that a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ with the property $ \forall x_1, x_2 \in X)[ x_1 \neq x_2] \rightarrow f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$ is an injection of $X$ into $Y$. We are going to prove the contrapositive of the injection definition by using $ \forall x_1, x_2 \in X)[ x_1 = x_2] \rightarrow f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. $$X \setminus S_1 = X\setminus S_2 \rightarrow s_1=s_2$$ By complementing both sides, we have: $$(X \setminus S_1)^C = (X\setminus S_2)^C $$ Then, we intersect both of them with $X$. $$X \cap (X \setminus S_1)^C = X \cap (X\setminus S_2)^C \qquad \text{by Proposition 3.3.5i}$$ $$X \cap (X \cap S_1^{c})^c=X \cap (X \cap S_2^{c})^c \qquad \text{by negation law}$$ $$X \cap (X^c \cup S_1) = X \cap (X^c \cup S_2) \qquad \text{by distributive law}$$ $$(X \cap X^c) \cup (X \cap  S_1) = (X \cap X^c) \cup (X \cap S_2) \qquad \text{by identity law}$$ $$\emptyset \cup X \cap S_1 = \emptyset \cup X \cap S_2 \qquad \text{by identity law}$$ $$X \cap S_1 = X \cap S_2$$ $$S_1 \subseteq X = S_2 \subseteq X$$ $$S_1=S_2$$ Since $S_1 \subseteq X$ and $S_2 \subseteq X$ there are elements in $S_1$ and $S_2$ that are the same in $X$, so the intersection won't take away any elements from $S_1$ and $S_2$. We need to show that for any $X \backslash S$, there is only one corresponding $S$. Since $\alpha(S) = X \backslash S$, the term $ (\alpha \circ \alpha)$ is its own inverse. $$( \alpha \circ \alpha) = X \backslash (X \backslash S)$$ $$=X \backslash X \qquad \text{by complement definition}$$ $$=S$$ Apparently, I screwed up big time because $\alpha$ is indeed a bijection which means that it's onto (surjection) and a one-to-one (injection). I need to start with an alternative proof by proving that $\alpha \circ \alpha =I_d$. Proposition 5.4.4 states that the composition of two surjections is a surjections. Also, proposition 5.4.9 states that the composition of two injections is a injection. My question is should I use Theorem 5.5.2 which is if the functions $f: X \rightarrow Y$ and $g : Y \rightarrow X$ satisfy $g \circ f =I_x$, then $f$ is an injection and $g$ is a surjection? Only in this case that would be that the left $\alpha$ is $f$ and the right $\alpha$ is $g$.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

686478,Is this analytic continuation possible?,"I'n new to complex analysis and am a little flustered by the following function. I would like help understanding whether or not it is possible to analytically continue it outside of the unit circle.
$$f(z)=\prod\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}(1+z^k)$$
Using Maple, it seems to converge to $0$, at $z=(\exp(\frac{2\pi i}{2}),\exp(\frac{2\pi i}{4}),\exp(\frac{2\pi i}{6}),\dots)$ and diverge to infinity at $z=(\exp(\frac{2\pi i}{1}),\exp(\frac{2\pi i}{3}),\exp(\frac{2\pi i}{5}),\dots)$. This makes sense as when any of the first set of roots of unity are plugged into the function, you end up multiplying by 0 whereas with the other roots you just end up multiplying infinitely many numbers all greater than 1. Furthermore $f$ should converge to $0$ for any $even$ root of unity, $z=\exp(\frac{2\pi ik}{2n})$, and diverge for any odd root, $z=\exp\left(\frac{2\pi ik}{2n+1}\right)$. This means that at any singularity, there are points infinitely close to it with $f(z)=0$, and for every point such that $f(z)=0$, there are infinitely many singularities near it. Is it possible (In theory or practice) to analytically continue $f$ outside the unit circle? Edit: I am reading as we speak, a Wikipedia article that states that if a function has a set of singularities on its circle of convergence, and this set is $dense$, then every point on the circle must be a singularity. Except this function seems to contradict that as all of our $even$ roots are not singularities (unless secretly they are!).","['functions', 'complex-analysis']"

I think I can explain the basic optimization of $f(x)$ pictorially and introducing (and for some re-introducing) the concept of a derivative. Then I plan to go on to Lagrange multipliers and discrete time optimal control. I don't want to lose them though, so I want to know if anyone has any good explanations, analogies, videos, graphics (or anything else) that will keep a lay audience engaged. Note I will use Lagrange multipliers in the talk to explain a particular application, but I want to convey the message that the math is interesting in and of itself and that it can be used for a variety of things.

Calculate $\nabla F(1,1)$ The attempt at a solution I know that $\nabla F(1,1)=(\dfrac{\partial F(1,1)}{\partial x},\dfrac{\partial F(1,1)}{\partial y})$. I am going to calculate the first partial derivative since the other one can be calculated in a similar way. $\dfrac{\partial F (x,y)}{\partial x}=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} \int_0^y\int_0^x e^{(u-1)}e^{(v^2-v)}dudv$. Now, I don't know if the following step is legitimate: $\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} \int_0^y\int_0^x e^{(u-1)}e^{(v^2-v)}dudv=\int_0^y [\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} \int_0^x e^{(u-1)}e^{(v^2-v)}du]dv$ If that last step was correct, I would like to know how to justify it.

686562,Understanding McMullen's Upper Bound Theorem,"I'm a computer science student working on a paper regarding constrained delaunay triangulations. I have been searching for a proof regarding the upper bound for the number of triangles in a constrained delaunay triangulation with $n$ vertices and I managed to find this paper: http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~amenta/pubs/HiDeeDel.pdf It provides an upper bound on the number of triangles in a delaunay triangulation (I was looking for constrained) using McMullen's Upper Bound Theorem ( http://www.ifor.math.ethz.ch/teaching/lectures/poly_comp_ss11/lecture7 ). The paper doesn't describe their technique for finding the upper bound from McMullen's theorem in depth, so I'm forced to figure it out for myself. Here's the problem. I have almost no math and geometry background past vector calculus and probability (my strengths lie in discrete math and graph theory), so I can't understand what McMullen's theorem means. I have a hunch that it can be applied to arbitrary triangulations (not just DTs), but I'm not sure how I would go about showing this. Additionally, I really only care about the 2-dimensional case.","['geometry', 'polytopes', 'graph-theory', 'triangulation']"
686579,Intuitively when to use the wedge product?,"When I first learned the dot product and the cross product in $\mathbb{R}^3$ I spent some time understanding when I would like to use them. After some time I understood that the dot product usefulness was its ability to detect orthogonality and its relationship with projections. In the same manner that the cross product gives means to deal with areas. Now in multilinear algebra I've learned about the wedge product of vectors defined in the tensor algebra. The definition I have is that if $T(V)$ is the tensor algebra of the space $V$, we let $J$ be the ideal generated by all elements of the form $T-\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)f_{\sigma}(T)$ for each $T\in T^k_0(V)$, $\sigma\in S_k$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and we set $\Lambda(V) = T(V)/J$. The wedge product is then the product of this algebra, given by means of $(T+J)\wedge(S+J)=T\otimes S + J$ from where it follows bilinearity, skew-commutativity and so on. This is hardly used on differential geometry and Physics, so that there should be some intuition on when to use the wedge product. I've also been able to see that if we are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $v\wedge w = \det(A)e_1\wedge e_2$ with $A$ being the matrix whose columns are $v$ and $w$. In that case, $v\wedge w$ is the area spanned by $v$ and $w$ times this $e_1\wedge e_2$ so we could think of it as a piece of plane. However, in other cases this doesn't work apparently. So, when we use the wedge product? What it is supposed to represent?","['multilinear-algebra', 'intuition', 'differential-geometry']"

686602,Uniqueness solutions of $dx/dt = f^2(x) + e^{-t}$.,"Someone can help me in the following problem? Is a question of Zhang . Let $f(x)$ be continuous for $x \in \mathbb{R}$, show that $dx/dt = f^2(x) + e^{-t}$ has the property of uniqueness of solution. First, I'm not sure that $f^2(x)$ referred composition or power. I tried both ways and I failed. My idea was repeated the proof of Cauchy-Picard Theorem showing that $$ F(x(t)) = x(0) + \int_{0}^{t}\left[ f^2(x(t)) - e^{-t} \right] dt$$ is a contraction. But I end up getting to the point where it seems I have to use that $f^2(x)$ satisfy a Lipschitz condition. But that does not seem true both in the case of the case of a composition as in case of the square power. For example, consider $f(x) = \sqrt{|x|}$, we have $f^2(x)$, seen as composition is $\sqrt[4]{|x|}$, which don't satisfy a Lipschitz condition. And consider $f(x) = \sqrt[4]{|x|}$, we have $f^2(x)$, seen as square power, is $\sqrt{|x|}$, which don't satisfy a Lipschitz condition. Some progress: We have 
$$x'(t) = f^2(x) + e^{-t} \Leftrightarrow x'(t) - e^{-t} = f^2(x)  \Leftrightarrow  (x(t) + e^{-t})'= f^2(x) $$ By the variable change $y(t) = x(t) + e^{-t}$, we have
$$y'(t) = f^2(y(t) - e^{-t}) = g^2(y(t))$$ See that the last step is valid both to composition case as in the power case. So, we have reduced the problem for the uniqueness of the problem $$ y' = g^2(y), $$ where $g$ is merely a continuous function. I do not know about you, but I think that this is not true. I think that $g(y) = \sqrt[4]{y}$, for $y\geq 0$ e $g(y)$, for $y<0$, is a counterexample in the power case.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
686603,Closure of Schwartz space in homogeneous Besov space,"Let $\dot{B}^s_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ denote the homogeneous Besov space of order $s$ with second and third index $\infty$, i. e. the homogeneous Zygmund space. Let $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ denote the Schwartz space of rapidly decaying functions. It is known that $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is not dense in $\dot{B}^0_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. It is also known that $\dot{B}^0_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is stricly larger than the Lebesgue space $L_\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$. My question is the following: Can we bound the $L_\infty$-norm of a Schwartz function $f$ by its $\dot{B}^0_{\infty,\infty}$-norm?
In other words, is there a constant $C>0$ such that
$$\|f\|_{L_\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)}\leq C\|f\|_{\dot{B}^0_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)}$$
for every $f\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$? A somewhat weaker statement would be whether there is a constant $C>0$ and some arbitrarily large $s>0$ such that
$$\|f\|_{L_\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)}\leq C\|f\|_{\dot{B}^0_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)}+C\|f\|_{\dot{B}^s_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)}$$
for every $f\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Interpolation theory tells us that if one replaces $\dot{B}^0_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in the above statement by $\dot{B}^{-\varepsilon}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for some $\varepsilon>0$ then the latter inequality is true for every $f\in\dot{B}^{-\varepsilon}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)\cap \dot{B}^{s}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. However, $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is not dense in $\dot{B}^{-\varepsilon}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)\cap \dot{B}^{s}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ either, so there might still be some room for improvement.
Also, if one replaces the homogeneous Besov spaces above by their inhomogeneous counterparts then at least the latter statement holds by the Sobolev embedding Theorem.","['fourier-analysis', 'sobolev-spaces', 'besov-space', 'harmonic-analysis', 'analysis']"

687220,Why is there antagonism towards extended real numbers?,"In my backstory, I was introduced to the geometric concept of infinity rather young, through reading about the inversive plane. In the course of learning calculus, I'm pretty sure I formed a concept of $\pm \infty$ lying at the endpoints of the real line (although they weren't real numbers themselves), and understood limits in terms of that. By the time I was introduced to the extended real numbers, it was simply putting a name to the prior concept, and providing a framework to work with them in a clear and precise fashion. (and similarly for the projective real numbers) Fast forward 20 years later, and through interactions with people here at MSE, I find there is a lot of antagonism towards the concept of the extended real numbers. I don't mean things like ""it would be confusing to teach them in introductory calculus"" -- I mean things like ""the extended reals $\pm \infty$ are best thought of in terms of limits rather than as actual points"" or even ""thou shalt not develop a concept of $x$ approaching something as $x \to +\infty$"" as well as some patently false claims (e.g. ""$+\infty$ cannot be a mathematical object; it can merely be a a 'concept'"").

687221,Proving $\sum_{k=0}^n{2k\choose k}{2n-2k\choose n-k}=4^n$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Identity for convolution of central binomial coefficients: $\sum\limits_{k=0}^n \binom{2k}{k}\binom{2(n-k)}{n-k}=2^{2n}$ (4 answers) Closed 9 years ago . Some background. I was asked to find an arithmetic function $f$ such that $f*f=\mathbf 1$ where $\mathbf 1$ is the constant function 1 and $*$ denotes Dirichlet convolution. I was able to prove that there are two solutions $\pm f$ and that $f$ is multiplicative. Next, I would have to evaluate $f$ at prime powers. I constructed a few values and my conjecture is that $$f(p^n)=\frac{2n-1\choose n}{2^{2n-1}}$$
for $p$ prime and $n>0$. To prove this, I only need to show that $$\sum_{k=1}^n{2k-1\choose k}{2n-2k+1\choose n-k+1}=4^n-{2n+1\choose n+1}\qquad\text{for }\;n\geq0.$$
(This is simply expressing $(f*f)(p^{n+1})=1$ explicitly, plugging in the conjecture.) For readers who don't really understand what I'm talking about and who are merely interested in the proof of the identity, you can just start reading from here. Hoping for a combinatorial proof, I interpreted the summation as follows. Given a set of $n+1$ indistinguishable marbles and $n+1$ distinguishable bags (say $b_1,\ldots,b_{n+1}$), the term ${2k-1\choose k}{2n-2k+1\choose n-k+1}$ counts the number of ways to put the marbles in the bags such that there are exactly $k$ marbles in the first $k$ bags $b_1,\ldots,b_k$. Equivalently, if we identify a configuration of the marbles with a monotonic path in a $n+1\times n+1$ grid such that the path starts in the bottom left corner and ends in the upper right corner, the sum
$${2n+1\choose n+1}+\sum_{k=1}^n{2k-1\choose k}{2n-2k+1\choose n-k+1}$$
counts the number of times a path 'crosses' or 'touches' the main diagonal in a point that is not the 'origin', if we summate over all possible paths. (There are ${2n+2\choose n+1}$ such paths in total.) For example, the following path touches the main diagonal $4$ times: At $(2,2)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,4)$ and $(7,7)$. (We do not count $(0,0)$ because the summation doesn't.) However, interpreting the summation like this I can't get any further. Any other ideas or suggestions on how to approach this problem? Edit:
There are some errors in my reasoning above, let's try again. Using the identity ${2n-1\choose n}=\frac12{2n\choose n}$ it can be rewritten as $$\sum_{k=0}^n{2k\choose k}{2n-2k\choose n-k}=4^n$$
which looks much better and holds for all $n\geq0$, making it more naturally. This form may give some ideas for combinatorial proofs but I don't really see any. The term ${2k\choose k}{2n-2k\choose n-k}$ counts the number of $n\times n$ monotonic paths intersecting the diagonal at $(k,k)$. So the summation counts the number of intersection points with the diagonal (all of them this time, including the origin) summing over all paths. As in Arthur's comment, it would suffice to find a bijection between all $2n$-monotonic paths (no matter their width or height) and the pairs $(p,s)$ where $p$ is a $n\times n$ path and $s$ an intersection point with the diagonal. Perhaps there is a weird bijection which would then solve the question. For the sake of a proof with induction, I considered all paths that intersect the diagonal for the first time at $(k,k)$ and all possible continuations and their intersection points, summed for $k$ from $1$ to $n$ using the induction hypothesis and a trick with Catalan numbers . (Writing out the details would be tedious, I think the reasoning becomes clear when you see the sum.) It turns out to be sufficient to prove $$\sum_{k=1}^n2C_{k-1}\left(4^{n-k}+{2n-2k\choose n-k}\right)=4^n$$
where $C_n=\frac1{n+1}{2n\choose n}$ denotes the $n$th Catalan number. However this doesn't seem to be a simplification.","['summation', 'elementary-number-theory', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

Conversely, for any infinite decimal, the set $E$ is bounded above, and the infinite decimal expansion is the decimal expansion of $\sup E$. How does one prove both directions? I was thinking that for the first part, we must use precisely the definition of the supremum. That is, if $\epsilon > 0$, we must find a number $h \in E$ s.t. $h> x - \epsilon$. However, it isn't clear to me that such a decimal number can be constructed. And how is the second direction the converse? I think it is a reiteration of the first direction. Set $x$ to be an infinite decimal expansion, and the result follows immediately from the proof of the first direction.","['decimal-expansion', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

687460,Maximum Entropy / Principle of Insufficient Reason,"I have a question about the maximum entropy principle and its implications.  Here's the problem that motivates my question: Suppose, for instance, I have a random variable $X$ which takes on the value +1 with probability p and -1 with probability 1-p.  Knowing nothing else about the distribution, we might decide to maximize $H(p)=-\sum p_i \log p_i = -(p \log(p) + (1-p) \log (1-p))$ to determine p, which is pretty easy to do with basic calculus- we wind up with $p^*=\frac12$, which is the same result dictated by the Principle of Insufficient Reason.  It seems intuitive to me (this is where I think things start to get somewhat un-rigorous), that another way to think about this is to imagine that $p$ is itself a random variable drawn from $P  \approx \text{Uniform(0,1)}$, and so $p^*$ is simply the ""most likely"" value of $P$, $\mathbb{E}[P]=\frac12$, which agrees with our prior result. Now, here's my actual question.  Suppose I have some solid theoretical reason to assume that $X$ is more likely to assume +1 than -1, i.e. $p>1-p$.  When I try to maximize $H(P)$ under the constraint that $p>1/2$, the problem becomes ill-posed- the function approaches its maximum at the boundary condition, which it can never reach- the ""answer"" is $p^* = \frac12 + \epsilon$.  But, under the other interpretation holding p as a random variable, this problem can be posed as $p^* = \mathbb{E}[\max(P,1-P)]=\frac34$, which is a well-defined answer and seems like a ""reasonable"" solution: if we know that $p^*$ is between 1/2 and 1, then the midpoint of the two can't be an unreasonable guess. Why does this seeming paradox occur?  Is there any theoretical answer that allows us to assign a ""nice"" probability like $\frac23$ or $\frac34$ to the question, or are we stuck with stating that the BC $p>1-p$ adds no new information, since the optimal entropy is still essentially the same?","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

We can find the number of spanning trees $t(G)$ of $G$ using Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem or the deletion-contraction method. I'm interested in the converse of this problem. That is, given $n$, find $G$ such that $t(G)=n$. Without some restrictions on $G$ this problem becomes almost trivial. For example, the cycle $C_n$ has $n$ spanning trees. Additionally, if we identify a vertex of graphs $G$ and $H$, the resulting graph has $t(G) \cdot t(H)$ spanning trees. Likewise if we join $G$ and $H$ with any path. So if we could factor $n$ we would just be dealing with the same question for smaller numbers. Thus I would like to restrict $G$ from being a cycle or a graph with a cut-vertex or cut-edge. My question is then, given $n$, can we always find a graph $G$ which is not a cycle and which has no cut-vertices or cut-edges such that $t(G)=n$? If it is possible to find one, is it possible to find many, or all graphs that satisfy those properties? If it is not possible in general, are we able to determine which $n$ it is true for?

687736,Does $\lfloor(4+\sqrt{11})^{n}\rfloor \pmod {100}$ repeat every $20$ cycles of $n$?,"I recently came across a post on SO, asking to calculate the least two decimal digits of the integer part of $(4+\sqrt{11})^{n}$, for any integer $n \geq 2$ (see here ). The author presented a Java implementation using a BigInteger class and so forth, but the answer (given by someone else) was much simpler: $$\forall n \geq 2 : \lfloor(4+\sqrt{11})^{n}\rfloor \pmod{ 100}=\lfloor(4+\sqrt{11})^{n+20}\rfloor \pmod {100}.$$ So in essence, we only need to calculate $(4+\sqrt{11})^{n}$ for every $n$ between $2$ and $21$. I have unsuccessfully attempted to find a counterexample, using a BigRational class and a fast-converging $n$th-root algorithm for calculating $\sqrt[n]{A}$ .

687757,Discriminants and Weierstrass form of elliptic curves,"I'm confused by what appears to be contradictory information. In this post, the claim is made that ""Every elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ can be written in the form $y^{2}= x^{3}+ax+b$ where $a,b∈ \mathbb{Z}$ with discriminant $Δ=−16(4a^{3}+27b^{2})≠0$. So the number of elliptic curves of discriminant $D$ is bounded above by number of nontrivial pairs $(a,b)∈ \mathbb{Z}^{2}$ such that $D=−16(4a^{3}+27b^{2})$."" Is this true? this post gives an example of an elliptic curve with integer coefficients that is not isomorphic to any curve $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ for $A, B$ integers and discriminant equal to the original.   Isn't this in contradiction to the original claim?  That is, the curve in the second link would not be counted as a curve with its discriminant, right? In fact, it seems to me (after plugging through the relevant changes of variables) that most curves of the form 
$$E: y^2 + a_{1} xy + a_{3} y = x^{3} + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{4}x + a_{6},$$ with discriminant $\Delta$ cannot be written in the form
$$ E' : y^{2} = x^{3} + Ax + B $$ with discriminant also $\Delta$ for some $A, B \in \mathbb{Z}$. Any help?","['elliptic-curves', 'number-theory']"
687764,How many elements are in the invertible set $\mathbb{Z}_n$?,"My question is directly, how many elements are in the invertible set $Z_{35}$? It's my understanding that for any $Z_n$, if $n$ is prime, then the number of invertible elements is equal to $n-1$. In addition, all elements that are invertible satisfy the formula $\gcd(x,n) = 1$. Thus, for $n = 35$, which is composed of two primes, the number of invertible elements should be $n-3$, or $32$. The non-invertible elements namely $0, 5, 7$.

687836,What exactly are n-forms and how are they related to dual vectors?,"I'm trying to get a hold of tensor analysis on manifolds and the idea of vectors and tangent spaces are just starting to click, but I don't really get how the differential of a function can be viewed as a dual or covarient(is there any explicit difference or is it just a matter of context and convention between covarient vectors and dual vectors) vectors. I'm coming from physics, so I have a lot of holes in my formal mathematical knowledge, please feel free to be somewhat pedantic to help me refine my language when talking about this stuff. So I am intentionally stretching my understanding so that it can be corrected. It boils down to this: In GR, we want to be able to talk about vector fields on manifolds to describe, for instance, the electric and magnetic fields in space. But the standard definition of vectors in flat space comes in terms of a coordinate system. First, is this a reasonable statement, and why is this a big problem? Why can't we just define vectors in terms of their components in coordinate system provided by some chart from the manifold to $R^n$ and then use our transition maps to see how that vector would be represented in other coordinate systems. What am I missing, why go through all this trouble and say we must talk about vectors in terms of directional derivatives? For whatever reason, we need to find some way to parameterize the tangent space of some point on a manifold. We do this by considering the fact that any curve on the manifold, $M$, is a map from $R \to M$. Then we can say that the set of all derivative of an arbitrary field at a point $P$ on the manifold are a basis for the tangent space at $P$, and we can label these derivatives by their direction in terms of which curve, out of the set of all (smooth?) curves through $P$ they follow. This is where I start to feel like I have no idea what I'm talking about. First off, don't curves have two directions we could follow. What is the space of all curves on the manifold? The space of all $C^{\infty}$ maps from $R \to M\to R^n$? Doesn't this bring in the coordinate charts once again if I am looking for smoothness of the curve in $M$, do we not care for smooth curves, or should I not be thinking of curves as maps from $R \to M$ and instead think of them as an intangible continuum of points with no other properties? If we choose to use the directional derivatives in terms of coordinates as our basis for $T_p(M)$, then dual vectors are differentials of functions. How on earth do differentials act on partial derivative operators? Maybe I'm just letting the notation dictate my thinking too much, but $df \frac{\partial}{\partial x^u} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^u}$ bothers me so much. In all the other math I've learned and hopefully understand the idea of taking the derivative of a differential is ill defined at best, but now we have this whole new can of worms, I don't know I just think I need some more convincing that this is a natural or at least useful definition. Are n-forms meant to generalize some other notion that I'm familiar with from more elementary mathematics? I'm particularly troubled because it seems in some sense we are saying that you can take the partial derivative of the gradient of a function, and that's the same as just the dot product of the gradient some vector (in terms of more classical vector constructions) Okay, I think that's long enough, thanks for the help in advance.","['differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"

687923,Iteratively Replacing Substrings,"This problem came up while I was helping someone. Informally, we have a string of characters and a ""rule"" which replaces a specific string with another one, and we repeat this rule until we can no longer do so (obviously if you replace a string with another which contains the first as a substring, this won't terminate). The question is, under what conditions will this terminate, and is there a general bound on the length of the resulting string? Specifically, let's try this with two characters, $a$ and $b,$ and let's assume there's only one rule. As an example, consider the rule $ab \mapsto bba.$ It isn't hard to see for a string of length $n,$ the maximum length of the resulting string is $2^{n-1} + n -1.$ The point here is that this rule essentially moves all $a$'s to the right (and it doesn't change the number of $a$'s), so the most it can do is double the number of $b$'s for each $a.$ A string which achieves this upper bound is $aaa\ldots ab.$ Another question is, why is it true that the order of replacement doesn't matter (this shouldn't be too hard, assuming it terminates... I think)?","['computer-science', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics-on-words']"

687942,Turn a torus inside out,"Let $T=D^2 \times S^1$ be a solid torus, where $D^2$ is a 2-dimensional disk and $S^1$ is a circle. Suppose we have another solid torus $T'$ and we have a homeomorphism $f$ sending a meridian $\partial D^2\times \{*\} \subset   T$ to a longitude $\{*\}\times S^1\subset T'$. Then gluing $T, T'$ along the boundary torus via the homeomorphism $f$ results in a 3-sphere. Instead of thinking another torus $T'$, we can think about the complement of $T'$ in $S^3$, which is also a solid torus. (Now I am getting confused.) Then, the above homeomorphism corresponds to a homeomorphism sending a meridian to a meridian, or orientation reversed meridian? So my questions are: Once we choose a meridian and longitude of a torus, is there a
canonical choice for a meridian and longitude of the compliment
torus? Let $(a, b)\in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ represent a curve in a
torus winding $a$ times in the meridian direction and $b$ times in
the longitude direction. I read somewhere that if we turn a torus inside out, the
homeomorphism sending a meridian to $(m,l)$ corresponds to the
homeomorphism sending a meridian to $(-l, -m)$.Is this right? Or, for
this to be true, what choice should I make? (orientation, meridian,
longitude.) I appreciate any help.","['general-topology', 'surgery-theory', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-topology']"

    f(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt(2\pi)}e^{-x}e^{\frac{-(y-x)^2}{2}},   x \ge  0,  -\infty \le y \le \infty
$$ Find the joint mgf M(s,t), and for what values of s and t does the mgf exist? The following is how I approached this problem. $
M(s,t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_{0}^\infty e^{sx+ty}\frac{1}{\sqrt(2\pi)}e^{-x}e^{\frac{{-(y-x)}^2}{2}}dxdy
$ $
=\int_{0}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{sx+ty}\frac{1}{\sqrt(2\pi)}e^{-x}e^{\frac{{-(y-x)}^2}{2}}dydx
$ $
          =\int_{0}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt(2\pi)} e^{\frac{2(s-1)x-x^2}{2}}e^{\frac{ty-y^2}{2}}e^{xy} dydx

$ I see $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$ in the intergral and y is to be integrated from $\infty $ to $-\infty$, so I believe that I need to make the expression in the form $\frac{1}{\sqrt(2\pi)}*e^-{\frac{(y-something)^2}{2}}*f(x)$  (pdf of a Normal distribution, and integral will be evaluated to 1 whatever the value something is)
and then integrating the expression w.r.t x from 0 to $\infty$ from there. But I cannot find any useful integration technique to evaluate this double integral.
I tried polar coordinate; making substitution $ x = r cos{\theta} $ and $ y = r sin{\theta} $
which will turn the integral to
$
=\int_{\frac{-\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt(2\pi)} r*exp(r*((s-1)cos{\theta}+tsin{\theta})-\frac{{r^2}(1-\frac{sin{2\theta}}{2})}{4})  drd{\theta}
$ Evaluating this I got $\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{3}}$ which I feel is incorrect as it's neither of a function of x nor y.
