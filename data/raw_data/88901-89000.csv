1187713,Proof that a sequence that converges to zero has a subsequence whose series is convergent,"How would I go about proving that if $a_n$ is a real sequence such that $\lim_{n\to\infty}|a_n|=0$, then there exists a subsequence of $a_n$, which we call $a_{n_k}$, such that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_{n_k}$ is convergent.

1187747,"How do I define a block of a $(0,1)$-matrix as one that has no proper sub-blocks?","I'm struggling to come up with a definition of a ""block"" in a $(0,1)$-matrix $M$ such that we can decompose $M$ into blocks, but the blocks themselves don't further decompose.  This is what I've got so far: Given any $r \times s$ $(0,1)$-matrix $M$, we define a block of $M$ to be a submatrix $H$ in which: (a) every row and every column of $H$ contains a $1$, (b) in $M$, there are no $1$'s in the rows of $H$ outside of $H$, (c) in $M$, there are no $1$'s in the columns of $H$ outside of $H$, and (d) no proper submatrix of $H$ satisfies (a)-(c). I want to define blocks in such a way that there are no proper sub-blocks in blocks.  But I feel item (d) is difficult to parse.  I can't just say ""there's no proper sub-blocks"" because this is a circular definition. Q : Could the community suggest a better way of phrasing this definition?

1187750,For what values does $x^{x^{x^{x^{.^{.^{.}}}}}}$ make sense [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Infinite tetration, convergence radius (3 answers) Closed 9 years ago . For which values of $x\ge 1$ does the expression $x^{x^{x^{x^{.^{.^{.}}}}}}$ make sense?
To tackle this, define  $f_1(x)=x$ and $f_{n+1}(x)=x^{f_n(x)}$ for $x \ge 1$ and $n\ge1$. a) Show that $f_{n+1}(x) \ge f_n(x)$ for all $n\ge1$. b) When $L(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x)$ exists, find an equation for $L(x)$.
Use it to find an upper bound for $x$. c) For these values of $x$, show by induction that $f_n(x)$ is bounded above by $e$ for all $n\ge1$. What can you conclude? d) What happens for larger $x$? I'm having trouble showing it is increasing for a). I solved b) with the fact that $\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)=L(x)=x^{L(x)}\implies x=L(x)^{\frac{1}{L(x)}}$ Maximizing on $L>0$: $$\frac{d}{dL}L^{1/L}=\frac{d}{dL}e^\frac{\ln(L)}{L}=\frac{d}{dL}\left(\frac{\ln(L)}{L}\right)e^\frac{\ln(L)}{L}$$
$$=\frac{1-\ln(L)}{L^2}L^{\frac{1}{L}}=L^{\frac{1}{L}-2}(1-\ln(L))$$
$$=-L^{\frac{1}{L}-2}(\ln(L)-1)=0\iff\ln(L)-1=0 \text{ so } L=e$$ Therefore $\max\{L^{1/L}\}$ happens when $L=e$ so $x\le e^{1/e}$ and I now have bounds for $x$ It then follows for c): Since $f_n$ is increasing on $[1,e^{1/e}], \max\{f_n(x)\}=f_n(e^{1/e})$ Base case: $f_1(x)=x\le e^{1/e}<e$. Assume $f_n(x)<e$, consider $x^{f_n(x)}\le x^e$
$\implies f_{n+1}(x)\le f_{n+1}(e^{1/e})<x^e<(e^{1/e})^e=e$
therefore by principle of mathematical induction, $f_n(x)<e$ for $x\in[1,e^{1/e}]$","['tetration', 'analysis', 'sequences-and-series']"

1188196,How can the centers of these 5 related circles be specified as a formula?,"This is my first time posting in this forum, so please forgive me if my question is too involved or if I've posted it in the wrong area. I hope someone finds it interesting enough to try their hand at it. Considering the image below, I am trying to work out a set of formulas that will specify either the radii or the center points for the five unknown single-colored circles. If I can determine either the radii or the center points for the particular five circles that I'll describe below, then I believe I can easily determine all of the remaining points of intersection in the drawing. In case the picture doesn't show up inline, or if you want to open it in another window so you can see it while you read the rest of the problem, here are a few different links to it: https://i.sstatic.net/VbFdk.png https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Z0g0E9vLRARDFRcUdRVU1UN2c/view https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EUiU3InO9qy-se2WGa1-DCAGs50K5ICtbE_GGWm578OaQjmOL3I9tHWjhCV1dge4eZsYrA_PZzU=w1142-h814 Regarding the drawing, the following facts are given: 1) All 4 corners of the bounding rectangle are 90 degrees. 2) The lower left corner is considered to be the origin (0,0). 3) The lower edge is 1 unit in length. 4) The Red quarter-circle has its center at (0,0) and a radius of 1. 5) The center of the Purple and Blue circles are on the Y axis. 6) The centers of the Orange and Yellow circles are on the vertical line defined by X=1. 7) All of the circles are tangent to one another wherever they appear to be so in the drawing. (This isn't a visual trick. They aren't 'just close'.) 8) Similarly, all of the straight lines shown are between centers of various circles and are either tangent or normal to the circles wherever they appear to be so. (Again, this isn't a trick question.) 9) The Green circle and the Blue and Yellow Half circles are all tangent to the top of the bounding rectangle, just as they appear to be. Since the center and radius of the Red circle are both given, the problem consists of determining the center and/or radius of the remaining Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Purple circles (or partial circles). The remaining straight lines and multi-colored circles are given as additional geometric hints, showing for example that the points of tangency for any three of the mutually tangent circles in question will always fall on a multi-colored circle whose center is at the intersection of the lines that bisect the angles formed by the centers of the respective circles. Now that's a lot of words for one sentence, so let me try to break it down and explain one case as an example. Consider the mutually tangent Purple, Green and Orange circles. The triangle drawn between their centers, intersects each of them at their respective points of tangency. The three lines that bisect the three corners of that triangle will necessarily intersect at a common point. That point of intersection is the center of the  multi-colored Purple/Green/Orange circle that overlaps the original three. Furthermore, lines drawn from the center of this new circle to the three original points of tangency are also tangent to the original circles at the same points of tangency shared by each pair of original circles. Finally, the resulting triangles are necessarily all right triangles! When all of the circles and arcs are removed from the drawing, what remains is a set of 35 right triangles that completely fill the outer rectangle. These triangles can be grouped by the color of the circle that originally generated them: 4 are Red (16 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 7 are Orange (14 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 6 are Purple (12 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 10 are Green (10, and it is the only single colored full circle.) 4 are Yellow (8 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 4 are Blue (8 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) Another interesting point. The top of the Orange and Purple circles may initially appear to be at the same height. In fact, they are not. It turns out that they can't be the same if all of the other rules are met. They just happen to be close. Actually, if the Blue, Green and Yellow circles were taken out of the picture and the rectangle shortened and the Purple and Orange circles resized slightly so that their tops were both at the same level, then the problem is very simple to solve for just those two circles. It's only when the three remaining circles are added to the top as I have shown that the problem gets just past the edge of my ability. Although I don't want to expound on it here, I have actually build a spreadsheet that reflects nearly all of the mutual dependencies, but since the spreadsheet can't have circular references, it ultimately ends up with two different independent forks or branches of calculations and the only way I have been able to solve it is to set one cell equal to the difference between the final equations on each branch. This difference represents the cumulative error between the branches using the baseline estimated angles. I then have Excel apply successive approximation - using ""What-if"" - to adjust the approximated values until the error becomes as nearly zero as possible. This approach gets me close enough for the practical purpose of drawing it here, but it still leaves my original question unanswered. To reiterate: How can I derive a formula that exactly defines either the radii or the center points for each the five circles I've specified? One final note, I suspect that this may end up requiring a calculus solution. If so, it's over my head (for now). I'll still appreciate any responses, but I'm hoping for a solution that I can follow using just geometry, trig and algebra. A compass and straight-edge solution, in the unlikely case that it's even possible, would be really cool, but probably wouldn't answer my real question.

I wish to compute $\int_{S^n} \omega$ to conclude that it is not exact (by finding that integral to be not $0$ and applying Stokes' theorem).

1188313,Right-continuity of the augmented filtration,"In most books about stochastic processes, the authors write about ""the usual augmentation of a filtration"". I am having trouble with proving that their construction is correct, i.e. that the augmented filtration is right-continuous. I will try to make this clear :
$\left(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P}\right)$ is a probability space with a filtration $\left(\mathcal{F}_t\right)_{t\in [0;\infty]}$, i.e. an increasing family of sub-$\sigma$-algebras of $\mathcal{F}$. One defines the set $\mathcal{N}$ of negligibles (w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}_\infty$ and $\mathbb{P}$) by :
$$\mathcal{N}=\left\{N \subset \Omega : \exists C \in \mathcal{F}_\infty, \mathbb{P}(C)=0 \text{ and } N\subset C   \right\}$$
We say that the filtration $\left(\mathcal{F}_t\right)_{t\in [0;\infty]}$ is complete if $\mathcal{N} \subset \mathcal{F}_0$ (hence $\mathcal{N} \subset \mathcal{F}_t$ for any $t \in [0;+\infty]$). One can always complete a filtration by considering $\overline{\mathcal{F}}_t=\mathcal{F}_t \vee \mathcal{N}$ (where $\vee$ stands for ""$\sigma$-algebra generated by). On the other hand, $\left(\mathcal{F}_t\right)_{t\in [0;\infty]}$ is said to be right-continuous if, for any $t\in [0;\infty)$,
$$\bigcap_{s>t}\mathcal{F}_s=\mathcal{F}_t$$
In the same way as before, you can ""make a filtration continuous"" by considering $\mathcal{F}^+_t=\bigcap_{s>t}\mathcal{F}_s$ and $\mathcal{F}^+_{\infty}=\mathcal{F}_\infty$. The ""usual augmentation"" of $\left(\mathcal{F}_t\right)_{t\in [0;\infty]}$ is obtained by first, making it right-continuous and then completing it, i.e. if we denote it by $\left(\mathcal{G}_t\right)$
$$\mathcal{G}_t=\overline{\left(\mathcal{F}^+_t\right)}$$ Now, it is claimed that this usual augmentation is complete (which I am fine with) and right-continuous, which, somehow, I cannot prove despite many efforts. I know that this question was already asked ( Right-continuity of completed filtration ) , but I think there is a mistake in its answer, which was accepted, so I thought that asking it again would be a good idea. edit : the last link now points to a correct answer.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory']"

Then there is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $E$ by definition of countability and this implies this direction of the proof. Now suppose that there exists an onto map $f: \mathbb{N} \to E$. If this function is onto, then let us consider the family $\{f^{-1}(x): x \in E\}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$, where 
$f^{-1}(x):= f^{-1}(\{x\})$. Because $f$ is onto, $f^{-1}(x) \neq \emptyset \quad \forall x \in E.$ So for each $x\in E$, let us choose an integer $n_x \in \mathbb{N}$ with $f(n_x)=x$. We now define a map $g: E \to \mathbb{N}$ with assignment $g(x)=n_x$. Up to this point, I believe that I need to show that $g$ is one-to-one since we are already given a surjection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $E$; this would give us an injection and a surjection, and thus a bijection which will prove this direction. However, if $g$ is one-to-one, then $g(x) = g(y) \Rightarrow n_x = n_y$. Does this mean that the same integer $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is selected regardless of the input that depends on $x \in E$?

This also explains why the null space consisting of only the zero vector makes the function one-to-one. For if in the RREF there were free variable(s) then the generating set for the null space would not only be the zero vector.

As for a Lipschitz function $g$ it holds that $H^s(g(A))\leq Lip(g)^s H^s(A)$, also for $f$ should hold a similar inequality. I want to know if what I've done is correct. So, let $f$ be such that $|f(x)-f(y)|\leq L|x-y|^\beta$ for each $x,y$. For each $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a covering $\{E_j\}_j$ of $A$ with $diam(E_j)\leq \delta$, such that $$\sum_j \alpha(\beta s)\Big(\frac{diam (E_j)}{2}\Big)^{\beta s}\leq H^{\beta s}_\delta(A)+\epsilon \quad (*). $$ Now $\{f(E_j)\}$ is a covering of $f(A)$ and $diam f(E_j)\leq L (diam(E_j))^\beta:=\delta'$, so $$H^s_{\delta'}(f(A))\leq \sum_j \alpha(s)\Big(\frac{diam f(E_j)}{2}\Big)^{s}\leq \sum_j \alpha(s) L^s \frac{(diam (E_j))^{\beta s}}{2^s}.$$ But $$\sum_j \alpha(s) L^s \frac{(diam (E_j))^{\beta s}}{2^s}=\frac{\alpha(s) L^s}{\alpha(\beta s) 2^{s-\beta s}}\sum_j \alpha(\beta s) \Big(\frac{(diam (E_j))}{2}\Big)^{\beta s}$$. Now from $(*)$, we get that $$H^s_{\delta'}(f(A))\leq \frac{\alpha(s) L^s}{\alpha(\beta s) 2^{s-\beta s}} (H^{\beta s}_\delta(A)+\epsilon),$$ so $$H^s(f(A))\leq \frac{\alpha(s) L^s}{\alpha(\beta s) 2^{s-\beta s}} H^{\beta s}(A).$$ Is it correct?

1189274,Ways of thinking about vector-valued differential forms,"I am trying to get a better intuition of vector-valued differential forms. Let $V$ be a vector space and $M$ a smooth manifold. Consider the space $\Omega^k(M;V)=\Gamma((M\times V)\otimes \Lambda^k(T^*M))$. That is, the space of $V$ valued $k$-forms on $M$. Intuitively I think of this definition as: For each $x\in M$, $\omega(x)$ is an alternating multi-linear map that maps $k$ tangent vectors at $x$ to a vector $v\in V$. In terms of the precise definition: For $x\in M$, if $\omega\in \Omega^k(M;V)$, we have $\omega(x)\in (\pi^{-1}(x))\otimes \{x\}\times\Lambda^k(T^*_xM)$ Firstly - is the above line correct? Since $\Lambda^k(T^*M)$ is a disjoint union, I would think that a section of $\Lambda^k(T^*M)$ would map an element $x$ of $M$ to $\{x\}\times T^*_xM$. So, because of the $\{x\}$ in the above equation, I feel like it is much more natural to think of $\omega(x)$ as the map described above but that it also outputs the point $x$ as well. That is, $\omega(x)(X_1,\dots,X_k)=(x,v)$. Is this wrong? What makes me a little uneasy is that since the bundle we are considering is trivial, does it not follow that $\pi^{-1}(x)$ is precisely $\{x\}\times V$? So then should it be $\omega(x)\in (\{x\}\times V)\otimes (\{x\}\times \Lambda^k(T^*_x M))$... Which just looks weird... My understanding is not quite there yet.
