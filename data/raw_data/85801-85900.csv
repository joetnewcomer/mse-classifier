1133559,Permutation isomorphic subgroups of $S_n$ are conjugate,"Consider $G,H \leq S_n$ and their natural action on $[n] = \{1,\ldots,n\}.$ We say that $G$ and $H$ are permutation isomorphic if there is a bijection $\varphi:[n] \mapsto [n]$ and group isomorphism $f:G \mapsto H$ so that $$\varphi(g(o)) = f(g) (\varphi(o))$$ or in the standard notation involving group actions $\varphi(o^g) = \varphi(o)^{f(g)}.$ I would like to show that in this case $G$ and $H$ are in fact conjugate subgroups of $S_n.$ And that the converse is true as well. I do not know how to really think about these problems. As I understand isomorphism of $G$ and $H$ does not imply conjugacy in $S_n$ but I have no idea how to use the relabelling property to force conjugacy?

1133571,Reason for LCM of all numbers from 1 .. n equals roughly $e^n$,"I computed the LCM for all natural numbers from 1 up to a limit $n$ and plotted the result over $n$.  Due to the fast-raising numbers, I plotted the logarithm of the result and was surprised to find a (more or less) identity curve ($x=y$).

1133572,Is there a formula for $\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} q^{n^3}$?,"When I studyied the representation of integers as sum of squares, I found that the most powerful tool is the Jacobi Triple Product , in fact this amazing identity allows us to find more useful equalities such as: $$ \prod_{n\geq 1}(1+zq^{2n-1})(1+z^{-1}q^{2n-1})(1-q^{2n})=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}z^nq^{n^2}$$
If we take $z\to 1$ we find an expression of $ S=\sum_{-\infty}^{+\infty} q^{n^2} $ and if we simplify $S^2$ and $S^4$ we can find the number of representation of integers as sum of $2$ squares and $4$ squares respectively which are denoted commonly by $r_2(n)$ and $r_4(n)$. My question: is there any formula which can help us find the number of representation of integers as sums of cubes?, for example a simplified expression for 
$$\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}x^{n}y^{n^2}q^{n^3}$$ I mean by a ""simplified expression"" an expression which can help us finding an expansion of $S'^2$ or $S'^3$ where $S'=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} q^{n^3}$. Thanks for your answers.","['power-series', 'q-series', 'number-theory']"
1133573,The pedantic function $\frac{y \cdot \sin(x^5y^3+x^3)}{(x^4y^8+x^6+3y^2)\cos(x^2y)^2}$,"I was shown the following ""pedantic"" function. 
$$
    f(x,y) := \frac{y \cdot \sin(x^5y^3+x^3)}{(x^4y^8+x^6+3y^2)\cos(x^2y)^2}
$$
The question is what happens as the function approaches origo. So in order for the limit to exists we need to check that the function is approaching the same limit for all directions. So along the coordinate axes we have
$$
  \lim_{x\to 0} f(x,0) = \lim_{y\to 0} f(y,0) =0
$$
Hmmm. Okay, lets test all straight lines through origo $y = k x$, some calculations again give
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} f(x,k x) = 0
$$ 
So it seems the limit exists, further studies show that
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} f(x,k x^n) = 0
$$ 
For all integers $n$, except $3$. Is this true? Conjecture Let $f(x,y)$ be defined as above then
  $$
    \lim_{x\to 0} f(x,k x^n) = 0
$$
  for all $n \in\mathbb{N}$ except $n=3$. Here we have
  $$
   \lim_{x\to 0} f(x, k x^3) = \frac{k}{3k^2+1}
$$
  where $k \in \mathbb{R}$. Is the conjecture true? I tested $n$ up to 2000. Also are
there other lines approaching origo that leads to a different answer than zero, except $y = x^3$? Can this be proven rigorously?","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

1133583,Paradox on the derivative of the rank of a matrix,"It is clear that the function $$f : \mathbb R^{m \times n} \to \mathbb N, \qquad X \mapsto \mbox{rank}(X)$$ has no derivative at all $X$ because the image of $f(X)$ assume values in the natural set. On the other hand, we know that the rank of any matrix can be computed by $$\mbox{rank}(X) = \mbox{tr} \left( X^+ X \right) \tag{1}$$ where $\text{tr}$ is the trace operator and $X^+$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of $X$ . Notice, however, that the RHS of $(1)$ is differentiable everywhere (the trace operator and the pseudo inverse have derivatives) and it can be computed as $$f'(X)  = (X^T\otimes I_n)\left(-(X^+)^T \otimes X^+ \right) + (I_n \otimes X^+).$$ I am confusing if the rank has or not derivative at all points $X$ .

My proof is as follows: Let $Y\subset\mathbb{R}$ be negligible and define $Y_{n}\subset Y$ by $Y_{n}:=\{y\in Y:|f'(y)|<n\}$, then by applying theorem (*)$\ \exists B_{n}\subset \mathbb{R}$ Borel s.t. $f(Y_{n})\subset B_{n}$ and $\lambda(B_{n}) \leq n\lambda(Y_{n}) = n*0 = 0 \ \forall n\in\mathbb{N}$, thus $\lambda(f(Y_{n}))\leq\lambda(B_{n})\leq 0$, so that $\lambda(f(Y)) \leq \sum \lambda(f(Y_{n})) = \sum 0 = 0$ thus $f(Y)$ is negligible.

1133697,How do I prove using the definition that the logarithmic function is continuous,"Do not define the logarithmic function as an integral. Do not use that $e^x>x$ because this assumes the continuity of the exponential. I have no clue on how to solve this one. I guess I got it, but i'll leave this question here in case someone else has the same problem.
$|\ln x - \ln a|<\epsilon \rightarrow -\epsilon < \ln \frac x a < \epsilon$ $ae^{-\epsilon} - a < x-a < ae^{\epsilon} - a$ (of course $a>0$) taking $\delta = \min \{ a(1 - e^{-\epsilon}), a(e^{\epsilon} -1) \} = a(1 - e^{-\epsilon})$ we're done. I guess. If anybody has another way of proofing please show me. The definitions of the logarithm function can be these: $\log : (0, +\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ $ \log(x) + \log(y) = \log(xy) , \forall (x,y)$ both real greater then zero.
Of course some basic properties come from this definition and you can use them.
But you can also define it as the inverse of the exponential as long as you don't use the continuity of the inverse to prove it. A better definition may be: $\ln(x) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} n(x^{\frac 1 n} -1)$ I need to prove the continuity of $f(x)=\log x$ using a $\epsilon-\delta$ proof","['calculus', 'continuity', 'real-analysis']"

At the center, the puck is traveling at a speed of $24$ inches per second at an angle of $45^\circ$ to the positive $x$-axis. (a) At time $t=0$, the center of the puck is at the origin. Find the location of the center of the puck at time $t$? (Note that time $t$ is measured in seconds.) (b) A point on the outer edge of the puck begins at the point $\left(0,\frac32\right)$. Find its location at time $t$? I am not sure how to find part (a), but this is what I have for part b). The puck has diameter of $3$ inches, a radius of $\frac{3}{2}$.

$y(t) = r \sin (t) + b$ the circle's center is at $(0,0)$ because of part a) statement. Therefore $x(t) = r \cos (t)$ and $y(t) = r \sin (t)$. I plugged in $x(t) = 0$ and $y(t) = \frac{3}{2}$ because of what was given in part b). 
From there I found that $t = \frac{\pi}{2}$ and that $r = \frac{3}{2}$, so now the formula is $x(t) = \frac{3}{2} \cos (t)$ and $y(t) = \frac{3}{2} \sin (t)$. But now I am stuck.

It is a 'simple' question where you only have to write the answer without justifying it, i.e. no proof is required, but I'd like to understand the problem better. Please note : $\omega$ is the set of 'natural numbers' as constructed by the axioms of ZFC. My Professor told us to prefer this notation because it is not possible to show that $\omega = \mathbb{N}$. So for this course it happens to be that: $$\omega = \lbrace 0,1,2,3, \dots \rbrace = \lbrace \emptyset, \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace, \lbrace \emptyset, \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \rbrace , \dots \rbrace $$ Problem : Consider the function:  $$f: \mathcal{P}(\omega) \to \omega \cup \lbrace \omega \rbrace, \ x \mapsto \bigcup \lbrace n \in \omega: n \subset x \rbrace $$
  Is $f$ injective, surjective, both? My solution : It does not surprise me that $f$ cannot be injective, because we have $\emptyset, \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \in \mathcal{P}(\omega)$ and for both we have $$f(\emptyset) = f( \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace)= \emptyset = 0 \text{ but } \emptyset \neq \lbrace \emptyset\rbrace $$
So $f$ is not injective and therefore not bijective. The solution however suggest that $f$ has to be surjective and I am having trouble understanding that. For every element $x$ in $$ \omega \cup \lbrace \omega \rbrace = \lbrace 0,1,2,3, \dots , \omega \rbrace $$
I want to find an element $y$ in $\mathcal{P}(\omega)$ such that $f(x)=y$. I can see how that works for all $n \in \omega$ but I also have $\omega \in (\omega \cup \lbrace \omega \rbrace)$ to map and I can't wrap my head around the idea of $$f(?)= \omega $$ It would have made sense to me to say $f( \omega) = \omega$ but that would mean that $\omega \in \omega$ by the definition of $f$ and that is forbidden by the Axiom of regularity .","['ordinals', 'elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

1133964,Problem 3.10 in Fulton's Algebraic Curves,"The problem asks to prove that every irreducible affine plane curve $f(x,y)=0$
has finitely many multiple (or singular) points. One possible solution is to say that at least one of $f_x,f_y$ is different than zero (these are partial derivatives) and so the set of singular points is the affine variety of $\mathbb{A}^2$ given by $V(f,f_x,f_y)$. Since $f$ is irreducible and assuming that $f_x \neq 0$, the sequence $f,f_x$ is
$k[x,y]$-regular and so $\dim k[x,y]/(f,f_x,f_y) = 0$. This then implies that $V(f,f_x,f_y)$ is a zero dimensional affine variety and so it must be a finite collection of points.

1134309,Newton's method to solve implicit Runge-Kutta-method,"I'm having a bit of a problem to solve an initial value problem by employing an implicit s-step Runge-Kutta method (and Newton's method). More precisely, I don't know how to employ Newton's method in this case. The initial value problem is pretty standard: \begin{equation*}
y'(t) = f(t,y(t)), \quad y(t_0) = 0 =:y_0 \in \mathbb R^n, \quad f: \mathbb R \times \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R.
\end{equation*}
I'm also given $f'$ (the Jacobian of $f$)  and a discrete time grid $(t_0, \ldots, t_N)$ as well as the Butcher tableau regarding the Runge-Kutta method:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c|c}  
c&A \\ \hline
&b  
\end{array}, \quad c \in \mathbb R^s, A \in \mathbb R^{s,s}, b \in \mathbb R^{1,s}.
\end{equation*}
Now I have to calculate the $k_i$ such that I can calculate $y_1 = y_0 + \sum_{i=1}^s b_ik_i.$ Since $A$ isn't necessarily a strictly lower triangular matrix, or even triangular at all, I have to solve a set of linear (or nonlinear) equations to calculate the $k_i$. So my first system of equations reads as follows:
\begin{align*}
k_1 &= f\left(t_0+c_1h,y_0+h\sum_{i=1}^sa_{1i}k_1\right)\\
k_2 &= f\left(t_0+c_2h,y_0+h\sum_{i=1}^sa_{2i}k_1\right)\\
&\,\,\vdots\\
k_s &= f\left(t_0+c_sh,y_0+h\sum_{i=1}^sa_{si}k_1\right),
\end{align*}
with $h := t_1 - t_0$. To solve this system, I have to use Newton's method. That's the part where I'm stuck. My current idea is this: Let $K := (k_1, \ldots, k_s)^T$ and define
\begin{equation*}
F : \mathbb R^{s\cdot n} \to \mathbb R^{s \cdot n}, \quad K \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}
f_1(K)-k_1\\
f_2(K)-k_2\\
\vdots\\
f_s(K)-k_s
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
with
\begin{equation*}
f_j(K) = f\left(t_0+c_jh,y_0+h\sum_{i=1}^s a_{ji}k_i \right).
\end{equation*}
Then I would start, as suggested in the assignment, with $k_1 = k_2 = \ldots = k_s = 0$ to find a $\tilde{K}$ such that $F(\tilde{K}) = 0$ via Newton's method, which would solve the system of equations and thusly allow me to calculate $y_1$. Then I could do the same for $y_2, y_3, \ldots$. I do however need the Jacobian of my function $F$ and I'm inadept to calculate it simply given the Jacobian of $ f $ I'm presented with. I suppose it'd look like this:
\begin{align*}
J_F(K) &= \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1-k_1}{\partial k_1} (K)& 
\frac{\partial f_1-k_1}{\partial k_2} (K)& \cdots & 
\frac{\partial f_1-k_1}{\partial k_s}(K)\\
\frac{\partial f_2-k_2}{\partial k_1}(K)& 
\frac{\partial f_2-k_2}{\partial k_2} (K) & \cdots & 
\frac{\partial f_2-k_2}{\partial k_s}(K)\\
\vdots & & \ddots & \vdots\\
\frac{\partial f_s-k_s}{\partial k_1} (K)& \cdots & &
\frac{\partial f_s-k_s}{\partial k_s}(K)
\end{pmatrix}
\\&= \begin{pmatrix}
\left(\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial k_1}-1\right) (K)& 
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial k_2} (K)& \cdots & 
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial k_s}(K)\\
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial k_1}(K)& 
\left(\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial k_2}-1\right) (K) & \cdots & 
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial k_s}(K)\\
\vdots & & \ddots & \vdots\\
\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial k_1} (K)& \cdots & &

1134730,In terms of units: is integration equal to multiplication and differentiation equal to division as a general rule?,"The question From practical experience, I know that the unit of an integral - resulting from integration of an expression with respect to a variable with a unit (i.e. non-dimensionless variable) - is the same as if the expression and the variable were multiplied. Similarly, the unit of a derivative - resulting from differentiation of an expression with respect to a variable with a unit (i.e. non-dimensionless variable) - is the same as if the expression was divided by the variable. This makes sense to me, and I have never really thought about it before. The question is: can this fact be regarded as a general (mathematical) rule? If yes; is it possible to give a compelling, rigorous and yet simple argument for this fact? If not; are there any good examples to illustrate why this may not be a general fact? An example When calculating the distance travelled as an integral of velocity with respect to time, the units are the same as when multiplying the two quantities. $$ \int v \, \mathrm{d}t = s $$
$$ [\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}][\mathrm{s}] = [\mathrm{m}]$$ In thermodynamics, when calculating the entropy as a partial derivative of the internal energy with respect to temperature, the units are the same as when dividing the former quantity by the latter. $$ \left(\frac{\partial{U}}{\partial{T}}\right)_{V,\mathbf{n}} = S $$
$$ \frac{[\mathrm{J}]}{[\mathrm{K}]} = \frac{[\mathrm{J}]}{[\mathrm{K}]}$$ Disclaimer This is probably a rather trivial question, and a strongly suspect that the answer is yes based on the relationship between the operations. However, I would love to get a proper answer based on sound mathematical arguments. Any helpful suggestions or hints are greatly appreciated!","['unit-of-measure', 'integration', 'derivatives']"

1134808,Shortest possible unreachable shape,"This is a follow up to Is every shape possible with a snake? . Imagine a 2d snake formed by drawing a horizontal line of length $n$.  At integer points along its body, this snake can rotate its body by $90$ degrees either clockwise or counter clockwise. If we define the front of the snake to be on the far left to start with, the rotation will move the back part of the snake and the front part will stay put. By doing repeated rotations it can make a lot of different snake body shapes. Now let us define a valid shape. A shape is valid if it can be formed from a straight line snake by applying at most one $90$ degree bend at each one of the integer points along its body and no two parts of the resulting shape intersect or touch each other. We now apply some further rules to say a shape is reachable .  A shape is reachable if it is valid and it is possible to reach the orientation without any parts of the snake's body intersecting or touching in between.  This includes during the rotations needed to bend a part at right angles. Here are some examples thanks to Martin Büttner. We start with the horizontal snake. Now we rotate from position 4. We end up after the rotation in this orientation. Now let us consider this orientation of a different snake. We can now see an illegal move where there would be an overlap caused during the rotation. When a rotation happens it will move one half of the snake with it. We do have to worry about whether any of this part which is rotated might overlap a part of the snake during the rotation.  For simplicity we can assume the snake has width zero.  You can only rotate at a particular point in snake up to 90 degrees clockwise of counter clockwise. For, you can never full fold the snake in two as that would have involved two rotations at the same point in the same direction. Shapes that can't be reached A shape that can't be reached is (Thank you to Harald Hanche-Olsen for this example) In this example all the adjacent horizontal lines are 1 apart as are the vertical ones. There is therefore no legal move from this position and as the problem is reversible there is therefore no way to get there from the starting position. We say that the length of a valid shape is simply the length of a snake that could form it. For example, the example shape above which can't be reached has length $59$. What is the shortest possible unreachable valid shape? Current upper bound David K gave a shape of length 31 which is unreachable. Is this the shortest possible?","['geometry', 'puzzle']"

1134857,Hawking's and Ellis' derivation of the form of Einstein's field equations,"On pages 72-73 of the book ""The large scale structure of space-time"" Hawking and Ellis show while determining the form of the field equations of general relativity that there is a relation of the form $R_{ab} = K_{ab}$, where $K_{ab}$ is a tensorial function of the energy-momentum tensor $T_{ab}$ and the metric $g_{ab}$. They then state that $K_{ab}$ is of the form
$$K_{ab} = \kappa \left(T_{ab}-\frac{1}{2} Tg_{ab} \right) + \Lambda g_{ab}$$
for some constants $\kappa$ und $\Lambda$. Here they use apart from the stated tensorial property the following facts. The contracted Bianchi identities ${K_{a}^{\,b}}_{;b} = \frac{1}{2} K_{;b}$ hold. The only first order identities satisfied by the energy-momentum tensor are the conservation equations ${T_{a}^{\,b}}_{;b} = 0$. Perhaps from Postulate (b) in the book the symmetry of the energy-momentum tensor $T_{ab}$. Maybe also some regularity assumptions on the function $K_{ab}$ are implicitly assumed. We have tried unsuccessfully to give a mathematically rigorous proof of this fact. In the vacuum case, i.e. the energy-momentum tensor vanishes and $K_{ab}$ therefore only depends on the metric, one can argue as follows: Writing $g = (g_{ab})$ and $K = (K_{ab})$ the tensorial property translates into the identity $K(SgS^T) = SK(g)S^T$ for all regular matrices $S$. It follows from Sylvester's law and the tensorial property that it suffices to determine the value of 
$$A = K\left(\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 &1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\right) \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 &1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$
Now, from the tensorial property one obtains that $A$ commutes with every element of the Lorentz group and therefore must be a multiple of the identity, for example by Schur's lemma. Therefore one has 
$$K(g) = K\left(S \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 &1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} S^T \right) = S A \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 &1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} S^T = \Lambda S \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 &1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} S^T = \Lambda g.$$
So in this special case the assertion follows only from the tensorial property. However, we do not know how to deal with the general case. Can anyone give us a reference or a hint? Moreover, does one need property 3)?","['mathematical-physics', 'differential-geometry', 'general-relativity']"

I have a question about the solution to this problem. It says that Clearly $f^2$ is differentiable everywhere, its derivative at $x$ is $f(x)$ (I'm assuming that this is because the left hand side is differentiable, the right hand side must be differentiable as well). So $f$ is differentiable at $x$ whenever $f(x) \neq 0$, and 
$$f(x)=2f(x)f'(x),$$
so $f'(x) = \frac{1}{2}$ at such points. Thus, $f= \frac{1}{2}x+b$ for some $b$ on any interval where it is non-zero; if $f$ has a zero, this gives two possible solutions, with two possible values of $b$, but since $f$ is assumed continuous, they must be the same. So we need $$\int_0^x(\frac{1}{2}t+b)dt=(\frac{1}{2}x+b)^2+C$$ so we must have $b=\sqrt{-C}$ or $-\sqrt{-C}$, leading to two solutions for $C \lt 0$. I don't understand the bolded statements. First, how does the differentiability of $f^2$ guarantee that $f$ is differentiable, and why only at $x$ where $f(x) \neq 0$? Next, why are there two possible solutions if $f$ has a zero, but since $f$ is continuous they must be the same? Finally, does the last statement mean that if $C \gt 0$, then there is no solution, since we're restricted to real numbers here?

g(r,r_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\exp\left(-\frac{z-z_1}{l} \right)K_0\left(\frac{|r-r_0|}{l} \right)
\end{eqnarray} Where, $K_0$ is a modified Bessel function of second kind and $l = \frac{2D}{v}$. How can one arrive at this solution? I tried to varify the solution but I could not go anywhere close. \begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial g(r,r_0)}{\partial z} &=& \exp\left(-\frac{z-z_1}{l} \right)\left[- \frac{1}{l}K_0 + \frac{\partial K_0}{\partial z} \right]\\
\frac{\partial^2 g(r,r_0)}{\partial z^2} &=& \exp\left(-\frac{z-z_1}{l} \right)\left[ \frac{1}{l^2}K_0 -\frac{2}{l} \frac{\partial K_0}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial^2 K_0}{\partial z^2}\right] \\
\frac{\partial^2 g(r,r_0)}{\partial x^2} &=& \exp\left(-\frac{z-z_1}{l} \right)\left[  \frac{\partial^2 K_0}{\partial x^2}\right]
\end{eqnarray} then putting the terms together,
\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla^2g + \frac{2}{l}\frac{\partial g}{\partial z} &=& \exp\left(-\frac{z-z_1}{l} \right)\left[\frac{\partial^2 K_0}{\partial x^2}+ \frac{\partial^2 K_0}{\partial z^2} -\frac{1}{l^2}K_0 \right]
\end{eqnarray} rhs of the equation should be zero unless $r=r_0$. possible definition of $K_0$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
K_0([r-r_0]/l) &=& \int^{\infty}_{0}\frac{\cos([r-r_0] \frac{u}{l})}{\sqrt{1+u^2}} du \\
&=& \int^{\infty}_{0}\frac{\cos(\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(z-z_0)^2} \frac{u}{l})}{\sqrt{1+u^2}} du
\end{eqnarray} rhs is then,
\begin{eqnarray}
rhs &=& -\exp\left(-\frac{z-z_1}{l} \right)\left[ \int^{\infty}_{0}\frac{\frac{1+u^2}{l^2}\cos([r-r_0] \frac{u}{l}) + \frac{u}{l(r-r_0)}\sin([r-r_0] \frac{u}{l})}{\sqrt{1+u^2}} du \right]
\end{eqnarray} Which I do not see how is equal to $\delta(r-r_0)$. What am I missing here?","['mathematical-physics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'bessel-functions']"
