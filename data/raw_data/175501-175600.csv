3141400,A pre-calculus problem about a quadratic function,"This is from a test (I'm not a high school student) given to rising high school juniors. The problem was designed to take less than 20 minutes, preferably 5-15. Judging from its source, this is not a trick question, and I am pretty sure all information given must be used. I already know its answer, but the difficulty is that we cannot use continuity, sequence, differentiation or integration. Let $f(x)$ be a quadratic polynomial with a positive leading coefficient. Let $g(x)$ be $ 1 - \frac{2}{x-5}$ with the domain $x < 5$ . For any real number $t < 3$ , let $h(t)$ be the minimum of $f(g(x))$ for $t \leq x \leq t+2$ . Suppose also that $h(t)= f(g(t+2))$ when $t < 1$ and $h(t) = 6$ for $1 \leq t < 3$ and that $h(-1) =7$ . Find $f(5)$ . It suffices to find an explicit formula for $f$ , which is the direction I am heading at. The slight difficulty here is that we cannot use continuity of $h$ (easily derived from the continuity of $f(g(x))$ and the fact that $[t,t+2]$ is compact; please correct me if I'm wrong). If we are allowed to use continuity, then $6= h(1) = f(g(3))=f(2)$ is the vertex of $f$ . We know from $h(-1) =7$ that $f(\frac32) = 7$ . So we know the positions of the vertex and another point on the graph of the quadratic $f$ as well as the fact that $f$ has a positive leading coefficient, so we can get an explicit formula of $f$ (I won't state it here since the solution is purely computational). Again, I'm looking for a solution that does not use continuity. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions', 'problem-solving']"
3141433,Volume of hyperbola revolved about the y -axis,"I'm trying to calculate the volume of the solid formed by revolving the hyperbola ${x^2} - {y^2} = 1$ bounded by $x=1$ and $x=3$ about the y axis, however I do not know if I'm going about this the right way using cylindrical shells. Using volume of a solid of revolution with cylindrical-shell method where the radius is ${x}$ and the height is ${2\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}$ , I got the integral: $$
\begin{eqnarray}
V &=& 2 \pi \int_1^{3} [x (2\sqrt{x^2 - 1})] \, \textrm{d}x \\

The equation would be $r^2-q^2-p^2=k^2$ equivalently $q^2+p^2+k^2=r^2$ which is somehow a classical diophantine equation (of the pythagorean quadruples) which have a parametrization but how do i use it? The problem is from a magazine at 8 th grade and i don't think the solution is supposed to use the general solution. Actually the general solution of $q^2+p^2+k^2=r^2$ is given by: $ q=a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2$ $p=2(mq+np)$ $k=2(nq-mp)$ $r=a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$ IT would follow that one of the numbers q or p is even and prime, so it is 2.",['number-theory']

3141551,"If the sides of a quadrilateral are $a,b,c,d$, prove that the area cannot exceed $(ac+bd)/2$.","MOP 1997: Let $Q$ be a quadrilateral whose side lengths are $a,b,c,d$ in that order. Show that the area of $Q$ does not exceed $(ac+bd)/2$ . My solution: Without loss of generality, let $a$ be the longest side. I first prove that the area cannot exceed (a b +c d )/2. Drawing a diagonal, we can divide the quadrilateral into two triangles with sides are $a$ and $b$ , and $c$ and $d$ . The triangle with sides $a$ and $b$ can have maximum area if the angle between them is $\pi/2$ . In this case, the area between them will be $\frac{1}{2}ab$ . Similarly, the area of the other triangle can have a maximum of $\frac{1}{2}cd$ . Adding them up, we get that the maximum area of the quadrilateral can be $\frac{1}{2}(ab+cd)$ . Now if this maximum is achieved, which means that the angle between $a$ and $b$ , and $c$ and $d$ are both $\pi/2$ , by drawing a diagram, we can convince ourselves that $a=c$ . This means that $a$ and $b$ are both the longest sides in the quadirlateral. Hence, by the rearrangement inequality, we have $(ab+cd)/2\leq (ac+bd)/2$ . Hence, the area of the quadrilateral is less than or equal to $(ac+bd)/2$ . Is the reasoning given above correct? Does there exist a better proof?","['contest-math', 'euclidean-geometry', 'area', 'quadrilateral', 'geometry']"

For example, according to the law, the following statement is true: (I do not like shrimp and ice cream is to say that I do not like shrimp or 
I do not like ice cream.) The intuition is that if I don't like shrimp and ice cream, then I must dislike at least one of those things. However, I actually love shrimp and I love ice cream, but the combination/intersection of those foods is something I find quite gross. So where am I going wrong here? I just can't escape/get around the notion that negating the intersection of two sets does not necessarily imply negating one set or the other. I even tried some computations in set theory to see if both statements calculated the same result and they didn't. For example: Let the universal set, U, be all the letters of the English alphabet.

3141702,Exact Differential Equation Geometry,"In a variety of contexts, I have noticed hints of a strong connection between exact differential equations and machinery from multivariable calculus. From another question, I have gathered that the geometry of finding the general solution to an exact differential equation $M(x,\ y)\ dx + N(x,\ y)\ dy = 0$ includes finding the potential function of $\begin{bmatrix}M(x,\ y) \\ N(x,\ y)\end{bmatrix}$ , that is, the surface in $\mathbb{R^3}$ whose gradient is the vector field $\begin{bmatrix}M(x,\ y) \\ N(x,\ y)\end{bmatrix}$ .  What is missing from this description?  For example, we can write the LHS of a not-necessarily-exact $M(x,\ y)\ dx + N(x,\ y)\ dy = 0$ as $\begin{bmatrix}M(x,\ y) \\ N(x,\ y) \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}dx \\ dy\end{bmatrix}$ , which expresses the differential of work done by $\begin{bmatrix}M(x,\ y) \\ N(x,\ y)\end{bmatrix}$ , and thus shows promise for extending the above geometric picture.  In fact, since work is a path function, I suspect the Wikipedia quote In mathematics, an integrating factor is a function that is chosen to
  facilitate the solving of a given equation involving differentials. It
  is commonly used to solve ordinary differential equations, but is also
  used within multivariable calculus when multiplying through by an
  integrating factor allows an inexact differential to be made into an
  exact differential (which can then be integrated to give a scalar
  field). This is especially useful in thermodynamics where temperature
  becomes the integrating factor that makes entropy an exact
  differential. is misleading, in that the ordinary differential equations and multivariable calculus uses are actually identical, which if correct, might allow geometry from other path functions (such as the referenced thermodynamics example) to be leveraged. A big part of what I'm trying to remedy is that it's not clear to me why finding the potential function of $\begin{bmatrix}M(x,\ y) \\ N(x,\ y)\end{bmatrix}$ should solve the ODE.  I understand the algebraic rationale that the solution technique undoes the multivariable chain rule (divide through by $dx$ then integrate both sides), but is the geometric picture just an afterthought, or does it offer its own independent rationale for the solution technique?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'differential', 'vector-fields', 'geometry', 'multivariable-calculus']"

Since $\phi$ is a diffeomorphism by Proposition 6.10 , $\phi_{ \ast}$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces by Corollary 8.6 and so carries basis element to basis element. Perhaps this is wrong because I am supposed to deduce that locally $X_{1,q} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\mid_{q}$ , perhaps with Proposition 8.9, something like what was done in the proofs of Theorem 21.5 or Theorem 21.10 to somehow use Proposition 8.8 . to somehow use to the $dx^1 \wedge ... \wedge dx^n (X_1, ..., X_n) > 0$ on $U$ from Lemma 21.4 $\leftarrow$ Again, without continuity assumed (all the more relevant because continuity is what we're trying to prove this time), a pointwise orientation is a frame and so $X_{1,q},..., X_{n,q}$ is an ordered basis for $T_qU \cong T_qM$ , by Remark 8.2 . Again, $\phi$ is a diffeomorphism by Proposition 6.10 , $\phi_{ \ast}$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces by Corollary 8.6 and so carries basis element to basis element. The $\frac{\partial}{\partial r^1}\color{red}{\mid_{\phi(q)}},..., \frac{\partial}{\partial r^n}\color{red}{\mid_{\phi(q)}}$ are smooth and so by assumption of equivalence, the $\phi_{ \ast}X_{1,q},..., \phi_{ \ast}X_{n,q}$ are smooth. Since $\phi_{ \ast}$ is an isomorphism, I guess the $(X_{1,q},...,X_{n,q})$ are smooth and thus continuous.

3141907,A question about Hartshorne Algebraic Geometry Chapter III Exercise 9.6,"(I am not a native English speaker hence there may be some mistakes.) Recently I was working on the problem III.9.6 in Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry . It states: Let $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ be a nonsingular variety of dimension $\ge2$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ . Suppose $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ is a hyperplane in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ which does not contain Y, and such that the scheme $Y'=Y \cap \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ is also nonsingular. Prove that Y is a complete intersection in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ if and only if $Y'$ is a complete intersection in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ . However, I was stuck on the sufficiency. I have tried to search for this problem but found no results. Hartshorne's book has a hint: use (9.12) applied to the affine cone of $Y$ and $Y'$ . I have tried this hint, however (9.12) is an algebraic result concerning about Noetherian local ring. For affine cone of $Y'$ , although its coordinate ring is normal since $Y'$ is complete intersection hence projectively normal, but it seems to have no connection with the local ring. Also, I really do not understand how this problem is related to section 9, Flat Families . For the completeness, I post (9.12) here: Let $A$ be a local noetherian domain, which is a localization of an algebra of finite type over a field $k$ . Let $t \in A$ , and assume: (1). $tA$ has only one minimal associated prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ , (2). $t$ generates the maximal ideal of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ , (3). $A/\mathfrak{p}$ is normal. Then $\mathfrak{p}=tA$ and $A$ is normal. Finally, I really appreciate any people who can offer help to me. Thank you very much!",['algebraic-geometry']

Hence, I wonder, shouldn't this be an easy problem that yields to methods from real or complex analysis? After all, it involves only simple terms like determinant, inverse, constant, polynomial etc. Specifically, the determinant condition gives a relation between the derivatives, which one may then be able to integrate in order to possibly obtain polynomials. To make this more specific, say that we have a polynomial function $f: \mathbb K^n \to \mathbb K^n$ , where $\mathbb K = \mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C$ . Then $\det J_f$ is a polynomial in the derivatives of the components and hence itself a polynomial. By the inverse rule and Cramer's rule, the derivative of the (local) inverse has the form $$
\frac{1}{\det(J_f)} \operatorname{Cof}(J_f),
$$ where by assumption $\det(J_f)$ is constant. Also, the cofactor matrix is a polynomial matrix. Thus, we integrate any of its entries for each component to obtain a local polynomial inverse, which is also global due to the identity theorem (at least in the complex case).

3142177,The relationship between the Euler characteristic and the fundamental group of finite connected graphs,"I have been asked to conjecture a relationship between the Euler characteristic and the fundamental group of finite connected graphs and, if possible, to prove the conjecture. We know that if the finite connected graph $G$ is a tree, then its Euler characteristic is $\chi(G)=1$ and its fundamental group is trivial $\pi_1(G)=\{e\}$ . If $G$ is the triangulation of an $n$ -bouquet, $\textit{i.e.}$ a union of $n$ circles all intersecting at one point, then we may observe that its Euler characteristic is given by $\chi(G)=1-n$ , and its fundamental group is known to be $\pi_1(G) \cong \mathbb{Z}^n$ . This gives the relationship $\pi_1(G) \cong \mathbb{Z}^{1-\chi(G)}$ in the case of an $n$ -bouquet. But, of course, not every finite connected graph falls neatly into one of the above two categories, and, in general, the fundamental group is not free. I suppose one might consider every finite connected graph as a union of graphs in one of the above two categories, and hence arrive at a general statement, but I cannot seem to see how one would go about this. I also feel that this must be a well-known result, but none of the resources I have consulted have offered any insight. All help or input would be highly appreciated.

Then $\mathscr B$ is a uniformly closed algebra. An algebra $\mathscr A$ is a family of complex functions defined on a set $E$ which is closed under addition of two functions, multiplication of two functions, and multiplication of a function by a constant. Definition of uniform closure: Let $\mathscr B $ be the set of all functions which are limits of uniformly convergent sequences of members of an algebra $\mathscr A$ .

Definition of uniform closed: If $\mathscr A$ has the property that $f \in \mathscr A$ whenever $f_n  \in \mathscr A (n = 1,2,3,...)$ and $f_n \to f$ uniformly on $E$ , then $\mathscr A$ is said to be uniformly closed . My question is: why do we require the functions to be bounded in theorem 7.29? For example, in proving $$f_n +g_n \to f + n$$ whenever $f_n \to f, g_n \to g $ uniformly, we can just appeal to theorem 3.3a (which states $\lim_{n \to \infty} (s_n + t_n) = s + t$ whenever $\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = s$ , $\lim_{n \to \infty} t_n = t$ ) to see that $f_n +g_n \to f + n$ uniformly.

3142293,Convergence of a Stochastic Process - Am I missing something obvious?,"In the paper On the Convergence of Stochastic Iterative Dynamic Programming Algorithms (Jaakkola et al. 1994) the authors claim that a statement is ""easy to show"". Now I am starting to suspect that it isn't easy and they might have just wanted to avoid having to show it. But I thought I would post this to see if I missed something obvious. What I have so far: Since $X_n$ is bounded in a compact interval it certainly has convergent subsequences $|X_{n+1}-X_n|\le (\alpha_n+\gamma \beta_n)C_1$ which implies that it converges to zero, but that isn't enough for it to be a Cauchy sequence even with the first statement $\lim\inf X_n\ge 0$ $$
\begin{align}
X_{n+1}(x)&=(1-\alpha_n(x))X_n(x) + \gamma\beta_n(x)\|X_n\| \\
&\ge (1-\alpha_n(x))X_n(x)\\
&=\prod^n_{k=0}(1-\alpha_k(x))X_0 \to 0
\end{align}$$ since $\sum \alpha_n=\infty$ (c.f. Infinite Product ). Because of $\alpha_n(x) \to 0$ we know that $(1-\alpha_n(x))\ge 0$ for almost all $n$ , and if $X_n(x)\ge 0$ then $$
X_{n+1}(x) = \underbrace{(1-\alpha_n(x))}_{\ge 0}
\underbrace{X_n(x)}_{\ge 0} +\underbrace{\gamma\beta_n(x)\|X_n\|}_{\ge 0}
$$ thus if one element of the sequence is positive all following elements will be positive too. The sequences which stay negative converge to zero ( $\lim\inf X_n\ge 0$ ). The other sequences will be positive for almost all n. For $\|X_n\|$ not to converge $\|X_n\|=\max_x X_n(x)$ for an infinite amount of n. If it was equal to the maximum of the negative sequences for almost all n it would converge. $$\|X_n\|=\max_x -X_n(x) \le \max_x - \prod_{k=0}^n (1-\alpha_k) X_0 \to 0 $$ If we set $\beta_n=0$ we have $$X_m=\prod_{k=n}^{m-1} (1-\alpha_k)X_n \to 0$$ So my intuition is: since $\beta_n$ is smaller than $\alpha_n$ (on average) replacing $\beta_n$ with $\alpha_n$ should probably be fine, since you introduce a larger difference to zero. So I think going in the direction $$X_{n+1}\sim (1-\alpha_n)X_n +\gamma \alpha_n X_n = (1-(1-\gamma)\alpha_n)X_n$$ Which is fine since $\sum(1-\gamma)\alpha_n =\infty$ for $\gamma\in(0,1)$ But I still need to formalize replacing $\beta_n$ with $\alpha_n$ which only works if I take the expected value. And I don't know if the expected value leaves the infinite sums intact. I also have to justify replacing the norm with just one element. I think I can assume that the norm is the max norm without disrupting later proofs. And since $\lim\inf X_n\ge 0$ , $|X_n|$ is basically equal to $X_n$ . I am also a bit confused since the approach I am currently following would show that it converges to 0 instantly while the proof wants me to show that it converges to some $X^*$ and then continuous with arguments on how to show that it converges to $0$ from there. Which makes me think, that I am not on the ""intended proof path"". So maybe I am missing something obvious which could save me a lot of trouble.

PART II: Using the vector identity $\nabla.(\psi \mathbf{A})=\mathbf{A}.(\nabla \psi)+\psi (\nabla.\mathbf{A})$ : $\displaystyle \iiint_{V'}    \left[     \nabla' . \left(

\iiint_{V'} \dfrac{\nabla' . \mathbf{M'}}{\left|   \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}
\right|}  dV'\tag{2}$ Now for simplicity, let's take the origin of our coordinate system at $P$ (see the diagram). Thus equation $(2)$ becomes: $\displaystyle \iiint_{V'}    \left[     \nabla' . \left(
\dfrac{\mathbf{M'}}{r'} \right)      \right]   dV' = \iiint_{V'}
\mathbf{M'}.\nabla'  \left(     \dfrac{1}{r'}       \right) dV' +
\iiint_{V'} \dfrac{\nabla' . \mathbf{M'}}{r'}  dV' \tag{3}$ Now by writing $dV'$ as spherical volume element, equation $(3)$ becomes: \begin{align}
\iiint_{V'}    \left[     \nabla' . \left(
\dfrac{\mathbf{M'}}{r'} \right)      \right]   {r'}^2\ \sin\theta\ d\theta\

&+ \iiint_{V'} (\nabla' . \mathbf{M'})\ r'\ \sin\theta\

\tag{4}
\end{align} In both terms: The integrands are defined everywhere except at point $P$ where $r'=0$ and the integrand $\frac{0}{0}$ . Since $\mathbf{M(r')}$ is finite everywhere, there is no blowing up of the integrands at any point. Therefore we can directly integrate both terms in the $RHS$ of
equation $(4)$ just like ordinary integrals. Therefore we can directly integrate $LHS$ of equation $(4)$ just like ordinary integrals. Now my question is: Is Gauss divergence theorem applicable to $LHS$ of equation $(4)$ ?

3142891,Please check my work finding related rates,"I have completed  a word problem involving related rates, and gone over it myself. However, this is the first relative rates problem I've ever done, and I would appreciate it if people would check my work. Problem Description: A boat is pulled into a dock by a rope attached to the bow of the boat and passing through a pulley on the dock that is 1 meter higher than the bow of the boat. If the rope is pulled at a rate of 1 meter per second, how fast is the boat approaching the dock when it is 8 meters from the dock? Since the bow of the boat, the pulley, and the dock can all form the corners of a triangle, I can solve the problem by thinking of it in terms of triangles. pulley height (adjacent) $= h = 1$ dock distance (opposite) $= b = 8$ rope length (hypotenuse) $= r = ???$ The rope's rate is $-1$ meters per second. According to the Pythagorean Theoream, $b^2 + h^2 = r^2$ . So, $2b \frac{db}{dt} + 0 = 2r\frac{dr}{dt}$ $$\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{2(r)(-1)}{2(8)} = \frac{r(-1)}{8}$$ Using the Pythagorean Theorem again, I know that $1 + 8^2=r^2 \to \sqrt{1 + 64} = r \to \sqrt{65} = r$ . Therefore, since $r = \sqrt{65}$ , I know that $$\frac{dr}{dt}= \frac{\sqrt{65}(-1)}{8}=\frac{-\sqrt{65}}{8}$$ $\frac{-\sqrt{65}}{8}$ refers to meters per second of course.","['related-rates', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

&= \frac{A}{r} \int_a^b \cos^4\theta d\theta \\
&= \frac{A}{r} \int_a^b (\cos^2\theta)^2 d\theta \\
&= \frac{A}{r} \int_a^b \left[\ \frac12 1+\cos(2\theta))\ \right]^2d\theta \\

Draw the incircle, and let $x, y, z$ be the length of the tangent from the vertices $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ respectively to the incircle. (So $a = y + z$ , $b = x + z$ , and $c = x + y$ .) Then the area of the triangle is $\boldsymbol{xy}$ . I can prove this algebraically, $^1$ but is there a picture proof of this fact? What I have in mind is that we cut up the triangle $ABC$ into finitely many pieces, and rearrange them into a rectangle with sides $x$ and $y$ . $^1$ Using $x = \frac{b+c-a}{2}$ and $y = \frac{a+c-b}{2}$ , we get $xy = \frac14\left(c - (a-b)\right)\left(c + (a-b)\right) = \frac14\left(c^2 - a^2 - b^2 + 2ab\right)$ .

Using Galois correspondence, each intermediate field extension corresponds to a subgroup of $Gal(L/K)$ and $|Gal(L/K)|=45$ . Using Sylow theorems, we show that there are one of each Sylow subgroups for $3,5$ and conclude that they are normal subgroups and thus their product generates the whole group.

3143084,Finding the derivative of $x \mapsto x^n$ for large $n$ using the definition,"If $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ , we can think of the derivative of $f$ at a point $x$ , denoted $f'(x)$ , as giving the slope of a line tangent to the graph of $f$ at the point $(x, f(x))$ .  One way to obtain the derivative is to consider a secant line through a second point $(x+h, f(x+h))$ on the graph of $f$ .  The slope of the secant line is given by $$ \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{(x+h)-x} = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}. $$ The tangent line results by taking $h$ to be arbitrarily small, so the derivative is given by $$ \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}, $$ presuming that this limit exists. Question: Suppose that $f$ is given by $$ f(x) = x^n. $$ What is $f'(x)$ ? For small values of $n$ , this can be computed by hand fairly easily.  For example, if $n=3$ , then $$ f'(x)

3143171,Are superelliptic curves singular?,"It is an easy corollary of the Riemann-Hurwitz formula that smooth double covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$ can only be branched over an even number of points. Let $F(x,z) \in \mathbb{C}[x,z]$ be a homogeneous polynomial of degree $2n+1 \geq 3$ , and consider the curve $C$ cut out by $y^2 = F(x,z)$ in the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}_{2,2n+1,2}$ with coordinates $[x : y : z]$ . Then there is a $2$ -to- $1$ map $\phi \colon C \to \mathbb{P}^1$ given by sending $[x : y : z] \mapsto [x : z]$ . It appears that $\phi$ realizes $C$ as a double cover of $\mathbb{P}^1$ branched over $2n+1$ points, namely the roots of $F(x,z) = 0$ , so I'd guess that the curve $C$ has to be singular. The weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}_{2,2n+1,2}$ can be covered by three affine patches: $D_x = \{x \neq 0\}$ , $D_y = \{y \neq 0\}$ , and $D_z = \{z \neq 0\}$ . Recall that $D_x = \operatorname{Spec} R_x$ , where $R_x$ is the $0^{\mathrm{th}}$ -graded component of the ring $\mathbb{C}[x,1/x,y,z]$ , and it is not hard to check that $R_x = \mathbb{C}[y^2/x^{2n+1},z/x]$ . Thus, in the patch $D_x$ , the curve $C$ has coordinate ring $k[u,v]/(u - F(1,v)) \simeq k[v]$ , where $u = y^2/x^{2n+1}$ and $v = z/x$ . (Note in particular that $C$ is rational and hence has geometric genus $0$ .) So $C \cap D_x$ is smooth, and a similar argument shows that $C \cap D_z$ is smooth. Thus, any singular point on $C$ would have $x = z = 0$ , but there is no such point on $C$ , implying that $C$ is smooth.

The problem/challenge has the following requirements: Input: $n$ and $m$ as dimensions of a grid Expected output: the amount of unique paths complying to the rules below: All paths start at the origin $[0,0]$ You can only travel upwards or towards the right (in increments of 1 step) Paths will wrap-around to the other side (which is the main difference with other similar questions linked below) Only count the paths which end up back at the origin $[0,0]$ , without visiting any other coordinates more than once. So for $n=m=5$ as input, this would be one of the valid paths: It starts at the $[0,0]$ origin in the bottom-left and follows the red → orange → pink → blue → grey arrows, ending up back at $[0,0]$ without having visited any other coordinate more than once. Two other valid paths would be to simply move up five times or move right five times. Let me start by saying what I do know based on some earlier questions : To calculate all unique paths for an $n$ by $m$ grid using only the directions up and right, the following formula can be used: $$a(n,m) = \binom{n+m}{n} = \binom{n+m}{m}$$ i.e. for $n=3, m=4$ the output would be: $$a(n,m) = \binom{3+4}{3} = \binom{3+4}{4} = 35$$ However, with the requirements and rules above, the expected output for $n=3, m=4$ is supposed to be $66$ . The reason I'm posting this here is because I'm curious if any kind of formula can be found for this problem at all, or if this problem can only be solved reasonably with a brute-force approach?

3144099,Let $G$ have exactly $24$ elements of order $6$. Why are there $12$ cyclic subgroups of $G$ of order $6$?,"This Exercise 8.47 of Gallian's ""Contemporary Abstract Algebra"" . Answers that use material from the textbook prior to the question are preferred. Let $G$ be a group with exactly $24$ elements of order $6$ . Why are there $12$ cyclic subgroups of $G$ of order $6$ ? The question is phrased differently in the textbook. It asks for the number of such cyclic subgroups and provides $12$ as an answer in the back. Context: I've been thinking about this on & off for about a week but have got nowhere. This is particularly frustrating because I think I should be able to do it myself. Here is a similar question of mine: Elements and cyclic subgroups of order $15$ in $\Bbb Z_{30}\times \Bbb Z_{20}.$ The kind of answer I'm looking for is a general approach (with the preference above). The reason why is that it's evident that my understanding is lacking here. Perhaps some easier exercises to this end might help too. Please help :)","['group-theory', 'cyclic-groups', 'finite-groups']"
