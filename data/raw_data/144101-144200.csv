I could't find the integral's domain. I took $0\leq r\cos\theta\leq1$ and $0\leq r\sin\theta\leq1$ from $(x_1,x_2)\in Q$. Then I got $0\leq r\leq\sqrt2$, but I didn't mange to find $\theta$'s interval, is it $\displaystyle \Big[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\Big]$?

2345327,Is being a right triangle both necessary and sufficient for the Pythagorean Theorem to hold?,"I recently encountered a Stack Overflow question (since closed) in which the OP was testing for whether a triangle was right by whether or not it ""met"" the criteria of the Pythagorean Theorem (i.e. whether or not the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the square of the two sides). The code was to this effect: public void Test(int a, int b, int c) {
   if ((c * c) == ((a * a) + (b * b)) {
     System.out.println(""This is a right triangle"");
   }
   else {
     System.out.println(""This is not a right triangle"");
   }
} (There are obviously some other problems with this code, like the fact that it doesn't validate the input to make sure that the inputs are positive and the fact that it only accepts integers). The question was asking about something completely different in the code and never directly addressed the test, but I got to thinking: is this a valid test for whether a triangle is a right triangle? Obviously, the Pythagorean Theorem states that, for all right triangles, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ (where $a$ and $b$ are sides and $c$ is the hypotenuse). This will hold for all right triangles, so being a right triangle is a sufficient condition for the Pythagorean Theorem to hold. Is it also a necessary condition? I.e. if $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ for some arbitrary triangle, is the triangle necessarily a right triangle? Or are there counterexamples?","['euclidean-geometry', 'trigonometry', 'triangles', 'geometry']"

2345393,"For two continuous RVs $X$ and $Y$ such that $Y=X$, does $P(X=Y)=1$ hold?","Given that there are two continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$ such that $Y=X$. Does this mean that $P(X=Y)=1$? My guess is that though $X$ and $Y$ are separately continuous, it is not mentioned that they are jointly continuous. So the joint density may not exist, in which case I cannot conclude that $P(X=Y)=1$. In other words, there does not exist any integrable function $f$ such that $P(X\le x,Y\le y)=\int_{-\infty}^x\int_{-\infty}^y f(u,v)\,du\,dv$ unless both the RVs are jointly continuous. But whenever it is said that $X=Y$, isn't it understood as being true almost everywhere, i.e., with probability $1$? So should I conclude that $P(X=Y)=0$ in any case? This also leads me to ask if it is necessarily true that $P(X=Y)=\int\int_{\substack\{(u,v):u=v\}} f(u,v)\,du\,dv=0$ for any two continuous RVs $X$ and $Y$.","['statistics', 'probability', 'random-variables']"
2345415,Finding eigenvector of $ \left[ \begin{smallmatrix} 0 & B \\ B & 0 \end{smallmatrix} \right] $,"$A \in M^{2n\times 2n}(\mathbb{R})$ $$A = \left[  \begin{matrix}   0 &

  eigenvalue and $x$ is an eigenvector and $|\lambda|$ is highest among
  all eigenvalues. If you can use only power iteration? If it is possible then how you should do it? I think that it is not possible. 
Here is the intuition I have: Let's suppose that we can solve the task. Then we can take arbitrary $x_0$ and  build a sequence of $x_i = A^ix_0$. However the structure of A implicates that if $x_0=[x_0^1, x_0^2]$ then every iteration swap $x_0^1$ and $x_0^2$, so the sequences  $B^nx_0^1$  and $B^nx_0^2$ should have the same limit, however since $x_0$ is totally arbitrary vector then only possible limit is $0$ which is not an eigenvector. Am I right and how to prove it properly?","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'numerical-methods', 'numerical-linear-algebra', 'linear-algebra']"

2345578,expected error when flipping bits of binary string,"Assume we have a binary string with $n$ bits. Now we flip $k$ (different) bits and get a new binary string. For any Gray code the two binary strings represent integers $x$ and $x'$. What is the expected error $|x-x'|$? Any idea how to calculate this? I'am interested in an analytical answer depending on $n$ and $k$. I'am not interested in approximation or a correct answer for small values by write force. Update: So I thought a bit more about this problem and I think the following is true. Let $M = \{0,\dots , 2^n-1\}$ and $\pi\colon M \rightarrow M$ a bijection. Then $$\sum_{x,x'\in M, d(x,x') = k} |\pi(x) - \pi(x')| = \sum_{x,x'\in M, d(x,x') = k} |x - x'|.$$
where $d(x,x')$ denotes the hamming distance. I haven't proved this, but letting $\pi$ be the above mentioned Gray code, this seems to be numerically correct. Computing the expected error when flipping $k$ bits is not so difficult anymore. I think it should be

2345744,Two approaches to a probability/combinatorics problem,"The statement: A city with $6$ districts has $6$ robberies in a particular week. Assume the robberies are located randomly, with all possibilities for which robbery occurred where equally likely. What is the probability that some district had more than $1$ robbery? The answer: There are $6^6$ possible configurations for which robbery occurred where. There are $6!$ configurations where each district had exactly $1$ of the $6$, so the probability of the complement of the desired event is $6!/6^6$. So the probability of some district having more than $1$ robbery is $1 - 6!/6^6$. The problem: I was thinking about this problem and found another approach. Of course, I know this approach is incorrect, but I can't find why . The number of ways to distribute k balls into n boxes is: $\binom{n + k - 1}{k}$. So I thought that the boxes could be the districts, and the balls could be the robberies. So there is $\binom{6 + 6 - 1}{6} = \binom{11}{6}$ different configuration of robberies, out of which, just one is the configuration in which every bank has exactly one robbery.

$$ One can find a solution for a family of products between exponentials and error functions. None of which apparently have the offset term in the error function. I have tried tackling the problem with two approaches. Approach #1: Expanding the error function hoping to find nice cancelations leading to the maclerin series of some known elementary function. Following a similar approach by Alex : $$
\begin{aligned}
\int\text{e}^{-ax^2 } \text{erf}\left(bx + c\right) dx &= \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n }{n!(2n+1)} \int(bx+c)^{2n +1} \text{e}^{-ax^2} dx \\

&\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n }{n!(2n+1)}

\\  
&= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}\sqrt{\pi}}  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n }{n!(2n+1)}   
 \sum_{k=0}^{2n+1} {{2n+1}\choose{k}} c^{2n+1-k} \left(\frac{b}{\sqrt{a}}\right)^k  \Gamma\left(\frac{k+1}{2},ax^2\right)

$$ I have used the binomial expansion for $(bx + c)^{2n+1}$ and that $\int x^k \text{e}^{-ax^2}dx = -\frac{1}{2}a^{-\frac{k+1}{2}} \Gamma\left(\frac{k+1}{2} ,ax^2\right)$ where $\Gamma(,)$ is the incomplete gamma function. Too bad, the last term can not be combined again in the form of a binomial expansion. Approach #2: Instead of expanding the error function, I tried writing it in terms of the cumulative CDF function (Q-Function) as $\text{erf}(x) = 2\Phi(\sqrt{2} x) - 1$. However, the following can be shown to be true using integration under the integral sign with respect to $\mu$. [Section 2.4 , and ref] $$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Phi(\lambda x) \text{e}^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}dx =\Phi\left(\frac{\lambda \mu}{\sqrt{1+\lambda^2\sigma^2}}\right)
$$ Now with some change of variables and rescaling we are instead interested in the following integral:
$$
\int\text{e}^{a_1 x^2 + a_2 x} \text{erf}\left(x\right) dx = \underbrace{2\int \text{e}^{a_1 x^2 + a_2 x} \Phi(\sqrt{2} x) dx}_{I} - \underbrace{\int \text{e}^{a_1 x^2 + a_2 x} dx}_{easy}
$$ However, what I'm not certain of if I can use the trick of integration under integral sign for the indefinite integral labeled I. Can I, with some change of variables, use the result deduced for the definite integral case as $\Phi\left(\frac{\lambda \mu}{\sqrt{1+\lambda^2\sigma^2}}\right) + C(x)$? EDIT: It seems that the problem in had has no closed form solution as pointed out by user90369 . Also, user90369 has pointed out that the following more general case have no closed form solution.
  $$
\int x^{2n} \text{e}^{-ax^2} \text{erf}(bx+c) dx
$$
  I was wondering, if there are any good approximations that I can use here. By good, I mean refer to an error that is $|e(x)| \leq 10^{-5} \forall x$.
  For starter, I was looking at the high accuracy approximations in here for the erf function. Unfortunately, none of these approximations result into an integral that inherits a closed form solution. I, however, have the following suggested approach with the use of the following identity.
  $$
\text{erf}(bx+c) = 2 \Phi\left(\sqrt{2} (bx+c)\right) - 1
$$
  This results into the following:
  $$
\begin{aligned}
\int\text{e}^{-ax^2 } \text{erf}\left(bx + c\right) dx = 2\int \text{e}^{-ax^2 } \Phi\left(\sqrt{2} (bx+c)\right) dx - \int \text{e}^{-ax^2 } dx
\end{aligned}
$$
  Now, one can use the approximation of the $\Phi$-function that results from applying Chernof's bound. Link $$
\Phi(x) \approx \frac{1}{12} \text{e}^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} + \frac{1}{4} \text{e}^{-\frac{2}{3} x^2}

But I am unable to show the existence of these polynomials in general. The first two cases are straightforward to compute (assuming $p = 3$): $$S_0 = X_0 + Y_0$$
$$S_1 = X_1 + Y_1 - X_0^2Y_0 - X_0Y_0^2$$ In general, I have the following relation:

Rabbits become fertile one month after their birth, after which they immediately, and successfully, biblically sleep with a mate: their gestation lasts one month as well and they give birth to a male and a female. The number of rabbits over time is then found to be represented by Fibonacci numbers $$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$ where the index stands for generation number. I thought about a probabilistic variation on the theme, whereby not all couples mate successfully. Instead, they are rather picky and a constant proportion $p$ of couples does not generate progeny during each given generation. 
What will be the number, rather the distribution of couple of rabbits over time?

Let $x^*\in \textrm{ball } X^*$ and let $(x_i^*)$ be a net in ball $X^*$ with $x_i^*\rightarrow x^*$. Then for each $x\in$ ball $X$, $$\tau(x_i^*)(x)=\langle x,x_i^*\rangle\rightarrow\langle x,x^*\rangle=\tau(x^*)(x).$$ That is, each coordinate of $\{\tau(x_i^*)\}$ converges to $\tau(x^*)$. Hence, $\tau(x_i^*)\rightarrow\tau(x^*)$ in $D$. Therefore, $\tau:\textrm{ball } X^*\rightarrow D$ is continuous. Let $\tau(x_1^*)=\tau(x_2^*)$ for $x_1^*,x_2^*\in \textrm{ball } X^*$. Then $\langle x,x_1^*\rangle=\langle x,x_2^*\rangle$ for each $x\in$ ball $X$, and thus $x_1^*=x_2^*$. Hence, $\tau$ is injective. It implies that $\tau^{-1}$ exists. Let $\tau(x^*)\in D$ and let $\tau(x_i^*)$ be a net in $D$ with $\tau(x_i^*)\rightarrow\tau(x^*)$. Then for all $x\in \textrm{ball } X$, $\tau(x_i^*)(x)\rightarrow\tau(x^*)(x)$. Thus $\langle x,x_i^*\rangle\rightarrow\langle x,x^*\rangle$ for all $x\in \textrm{ball } X$. Hence, $x_i^*\rightarrow x^*$ in ball $X^*$ for all $x\in \textrm{ball } X$. Therefore, $\tau^{-1}:D\rightarrow\textrm{ball } X^*$ is continuous. Since the map from $\textrm{ball } X^*$ to $\tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$ is bijective, $\tau$ is a homeomorphism from $\textrm{ball } X^*$ onto $\tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$. Let $f\in D$ and let $(x_i^*)$ be a net in ball $X^*$ such that $\tau(x_i^*)\rightarrow f$ in $D$. Then $f(x)=\lim\langle x,x_i^*\rangle$ exists for every $x\in$ ball $X$. Now we extend $f$ to $F:X\rightarrow\mathbb{F}$. Let $\alpha>0$ be such that $\|\alpha x\|\leqslant1$ for all $x\in X$. Then define $F(x)=\alpha^{-1}f(\alpha x)$. If also $\beta>0$ such that $\|\beta x\| \leqslant1$ for all $x\in X$, then $$\alpha^{-1}f(\alpha x) = \alpha^{-1} \lim \langle\alpha x, x_i^*\rangle=\beta^{-1}\lim\langle\beta x, x_i^*\rangle = \beta^{-1}f(\beta x).$$ Hence, $F(x)$ is well defined. For any $x_1,x_2\in X$ and $a\in\mathbb{F}$, we have
\begin{align*}
F(ax_1+x_2)&=\alpha^{-1}f(\alpha (ax_1+x_2))\\&=\alpha^{-1}\lim\langle\alpha ax_1+\alpha x_2,x_i^*\rangle\\&=a\alpha^{-1}\lim\langle\alpha x_1,x_i^*\rangle+\alpha^{-1}\lim\langle\alpha x_2,x_i^*\rangle\\&=a\alpha^{-1}f(\alpha x_1)+\alpha^{-1}f(\alpha x_2)\\&=aF(x_1)+F(x_2).
\end{align*}
Hence, $F$ is linear. Since $f\in D$, $f(x)\in D_x$ for all $x\in$ ball $X$. Thus $|f(x)|\leqslant1$ for all $x\in \textrm{ball } X$. 
Now let $\alpha=\frac{1}{\|x\|}$ for $x\in X-\{0\}$. Then $F(x)=\|x\|f(\frac{x}{\|x\|})$. Since $\frac{x}{\|x\|}\in \textrm{ball } X$, $|f(\frac{x}{\|x\|})|\leqslant1$. Thus $\|F(x)\|\leqslant\|x\|$ for $x\in X-\{0\}$. If $x=0$, $F(x)=0$. Hence, $\|F(x)\|\leqslant\|x\|$ for all $x\in X$. It implies that $F:X\rightarrow\mathbb{F}$ is a linear bounded functional and $\|F\|\leqslant1$; that is, $F\in\textrm{ball } X^*$. For any $x\in \textrm{ball } X$, we have $\tau(F)(x)=\langle x,F\rangle=f(x)$. It follows that $f\in \tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$. Since $\tau(x_i^*)\rightarrow f$, $\tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$ is closed in $D$. Thus $\tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$ is compact. Therefore, ball $X^*$ is weak-star compact.","['banach-spaces', 'normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'general-topology', 'analysis']"
2346519,Probability that a random pair of points are opposite corners of a square in an $n\times n$ integer lattice,"Question: Find the probability that a random pair of lattice points are opposite corners of a square in an $n\times n$ integer lattice. Note: By a square in a lattice, I mean a square whose vertices are all lattice points. Motivation: I have a messy proof that the solution is $\frac13$. The proof relies on calculating the total number of squares in each $n\times n$ lattice, but I want to know if there is some neat argument which avoids that method. There's reason to think there might be since the result is independent of $n$. Background: First notice that in an $n\times n$ integer lattice, there are more squares than the obvious axis-aligned squares, for example the following: With some calculation, one can find that the total number of squares in this grid is 
$$\sum\limits_{k=1}^nk^2(n-k)=\frac{(n-1)n^2(n+1)}{12}$$
I noticed that this can also be written as $\dfrac{n^2 \choose 2}{6}$, which led me to the combinatorial interpretation of picking corners of a square. Once we know that the number of squares is $\frac{1}{6}$-th of the number of pairs of points, the claimed solution of $\frac13$ is an immediate consequence (as each square has two pairs of opposite corners). However,  I've searched for the past week and failed to discover a proof without relying on counting all the squares.

Recursion tree. We see that $$\sum_{i = 0}^{\log_{3}(n)}n2^i=\Theta(n^{1+\log_3(2)})<<T(n) << \sum_{i = 0}^{\log_{3/2}(n)} n2^i = \Theta(n^{1+\log_{3/2}(2)})$$ but cannot, as I can see, get $\Theta(T(n))$ exactly. 2). Akra-Bazzi Theorem. We get through straightforward calculus that $T(n) = \Theta(n^p)$ where $2+2^{p+1} = 3^p$. As far as I can see this equation yields no closed form for $p\,$ (But it gives a numerical approximation consistent with 1, so that is good). The goal is to get a closed form better than $2^{p+1}+2 = 3^p.$ I believe such a closed form does exist, for reasons associated with the expected difficulty of the problem, and that it can be found through an alternate derivation, transformations or some other trick.

Twin goals of the question, any answer resolving either will be accepted: (1). Can this problem be solved without the use of the Akra-Bazzi Theorem? (2). Find a better closed form for $p$.

2346586,How to solve for a variable in an equation that involves XOR?,"I was recently introduced to XOR and other bitwise operators while reading up some articles on C++.

2346612,Logical Foundation of Banach Manifold,"Let $X$ be a set. Recall that an atlas of Banach Manifold on $X$ is a set of charts $\mathcal{A} = \{(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha, E_\alpha)\}_\alpha$ where $\varphi_\alpha: U_\alpha\to \varphi_\alpha(U_\alpha)\subset E_\alpha$ is a bijection, $E_\alpha$ is a Banach space, and a compatibility condition between the charts is satisified. This standard definition can be found in the Wikipedia article on Banach Manifolds . One could so define a Banach Manifold to be a couple $(X, \mathcal{A})$. But a larger atlas is needed to do differential geometry. Namely, all charts that are compatible with $\mathcal{A}$ are also charts. Said differently, if $\mathcal{B}$ is an atlas on $X$ such that $\mathcal{A}\bigcup\mathcal{B}$ is also an atlas on $X$, the two atlas are said to be compatible. So charts of $\mathcal{B}$ are also wanted charts, more precisely $(X, \mathcal{A})$ and $(X, \mathcal{B})$ describe the same manifold. The collection of all atlases on $X$ is not a set because one can choose a Banach space from the class of all Banach spaces... On Wikipedia, I quote: Compatibility defines an equivalence relation on the class of all possible atlases on $X$. Is it possible to define an equivalence relation like that on a proper class? If so, it's not with ZFC, so is it with NBG? Could you give me more details? Then, still on Wikipedia, A $C^r$-manifold structure on $X$ is then defined to be a choice of equivalence class of atlases on $X$ of class $C^r$ So let's call $\bar{\mathcal{A}}$ this equivalence class. Now could a Banach manifold be the couple $(X, \bar{\mathcal{A}})$?. I doubt that it's logically consistent to talk about the couple $(X, \bar{\mathcal{A}})$ since $\bar{\mathcal{A}}$ is a proper class. Is it? I should say that it's not really a question about differential geometry but about logic. Many (most?) of the authors I read about this don't talk about this logical issue. For example, S. Lang's Foundation of Differential Geometry or Bourbaki's ""Fascicule des résultats"". But Bourbaki seem's to use their own logic. Finally, I should add that in the case you restrict the possibilities to a set of Banach spaces (for instance $\{\mathbb{R}^n,\, n\geq0\}$), you don't have any issues. But it's more satisfactory to allow every Banach space or classes like Hilbert spaces or finite dimensional normed spaces.

2346656,"If $\xi$ is unramified at the valuation $v$, does the associated homogeneous space $C/K$ have a $K_v$-rational point?","I'm looking at the following Corollary/Remark $(4.4-4.5)$ in Chapter X of Silverman's Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves: Let $\phi:E/K\to E'/K$ be an isogeny defined over $K$, and $S$ a finite set of places (plus some conditions on $S$ which don't matter for my question). If $H^1(G_{\overline K/K},E[\phi];S)$ denotes the subset of $H^1(G_{\overline K/K},E[\phi])$ consisting of elements unramified outside of $S$, then $$S^{(\phi)}(E/K)\subseteq H^1(G_{\overline K/K},E[\phi],S).$$ Here, $S^{(\phi)}(E/K)$ is the Selmer group of $\phi$, which is equal to $$S^{(\phi)}(E/K)=\ker\left(H^1(G_{\overline K/K},E[\phi])\to\prod_{v\in M_K}WC(E/K_v)\right),$$ where $M_K$ denotes the set of places on $K$, and $WC(E/K_v)$ is the Weil-Chatelet group of $E/K_v$. We know at this point that for $\xi\in H^1(G_{\overline K/K},E[\phi])$, the image of $\xi$ in $WC(E/K_v)$ is nontrivial if and only if there exists an $K_v$-rational point on $C$, where $C$ is the homogeneous space associated to $\xi$. The author makes the following remark: To determine whether a given element $\xi\in H^1(G_{\overline K/K},E[\phi],S)$ is in $S^{(\phi)}(E/K)$, one takes the corresponding homogeneous space $C/K$ for $\xi$ and checks whether $C(K_v)\neq\varnothing$ for the finitely many $v\in S$. By definition and what we noted a paragraph above, it's true that $\xi$ is in $S^{(\phi)}(E/K)$ if and only if $C(K_v)\neq\varnothing$ for all valuations $v\in M_K$. However, by the remark above it seems that we only need to check the valuations $v$ where $\xi$ might be ramified? Does this mean then that the author is implicitly using the fact that if $\xi$ is unramified at $v$, then $C(K_v)\neq\varnothing$? If this is the case, then how would I show this explicitly? I've thought about it some but haven't gotten far.. if $\xi$ is unramified at $v$ then by definition, the image of $\xi$ under the ""restriction"" map $H^1(G_{\overline K/K},E[\phi])\to H^1(I_v,E[\phi])$ is zero, where $I_v$ is the inertia group of $v$. Or in other words, there is some $P\in E[\phi]$ such that $\xi_{\sigma}=P^{\sigma}-P$ for all $\sigma\in I_v$. By basic properties of homogeneous spaces, we know that there exists an isomorphism $\theta:E\to C$ defined over $\overline K$. If we could show that $\theta$ is in fact defined over $K_v$, then we'd have $\theta(O)\in C(K_v)$. To do this, it suffices to show (I think?) that $\theta(Q^{\sigma})=\theta(Q)^{\sigma}$ for all $Q\in E$ and $\sigma\in G_{\overline K/K}$ which fix all elements of $K_v\cap\overline K$. I'm not sure how to put these things together. How can I use the unramified assumption on $\xi$ to show that $\theta$ is defined over $K_v$? It seems that because we've chosen $\theta$ arbitrarily, we can't even guarantee it'll be defined over $K_v$. So maybe I need to explicitly construct $\theta$, but how would I do this?

For a maximum or minimum of $y$, we have $\frac{\text dy}{\text dx}=0$ \begin{align}p\sin^{p-1}\theta\cos^{q+1}\theta-q\sin^{p+1}\theta\cos^{q-1}\theta&=0\\
\sin^{p-1}\theta\cos^{q-1}\theta(p\cos^2\theta-q\sin^2\theta)&=0\end{align} Therefore \begin{align}\sin\theta&=0\\
&\Downarrow\\
\theta&=0\\
\text{or } \cos\theta&=0\\
&\Downarrow\\
\theta&=\frac \pi 2\\
\text{or }\tan^2\theta&=\frac pq\\
&\Downarrow\\
\theta&=\tan^{-1}\sqrt{p/q}\end{align} Now $y=0$ at $\theta=0$ and also at $\theta=\frac\pi2$ When $0<\theta<\frac\pi2$, $y$ is positive Also, $\tan^{-1}\sqrt{p/q}$ is the only value of $\theta$ lying between $0$ and $\frac \pi2$ at which $\frac{\text d}{\text dx}=0$. Hence $y$ is maximum when $$\theta=\tan^{-1}\sqrt{p/q}$$ This can be seen from the graph of $y$","['maxima-minima', 'calculus']"
2346892,Does having exactly one of each element in every row and column of a Cayley table ensure that it’s a group?,"A group must have a Cayley table in which each row and column has one and only one of each element. This can be proved by considering the opposite: suppose one row of a set’s Cayley table did not contain a particular element. That is, let A X not equal B, whatever X is. Let C be A’s inverse, such that C A = I. We easily reach a contradiction of associativity with A C B. (A*C) B = I B = B. On the other hand, A*(C B) = A X, does not equal B. Hence, each row and column of a group's Cayley table must contain exactly one of each element. Two questions then arise: Does a Cayley table in which each row and column has exactly one of each element guarantee that it is a group? For a given number of elements, how many possible non-isomorphic groups are there? For instance, there is only one group with three elements. I think there are 4 groups with four elements.","['group-theory', 'cayley-table']"

The claim is that if a sequence $(f_k)$ in a Hilbert space $H$ has a biorthogonal sequence $(g_k)$, i.e. if there exists a sequence $(g_k)$ in $H$ such that $\left< f_j, g_k \right> = \delta(j, k)$, then $(f_k)$ is minimal , i.e. $f_j \not \in \overline {\operatorname{span}} \{ f_k : k \neq j \}$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$. My problem is that the author doesn't justify this at all, and I can't figure out why this would be so. My problem is that by biorthogonality, I can ascertain information about the relationships between terms in $(f_k)$ and terms in $(g_k)$, but minimality is a statement about the relations between terms of $(f_k)$. Can someone explain how this step is supposed to work? Is there supposed to be an added condition about biorthogonal complete sequences, or rather $(g_k)$ being complete in $\overline{\operatorname{span}} \{ f_k : k \in \mathbb{N} \}$? I ask because though I'm unfamiliar with the matter, it seems intuitively that it'd be easier to construct a biorthogonal sequence if you had more ""ambient space"" to work in, so perhaps I couldn't find a biorthogonal sequence composed of elements of $H$, but could if I widened my selection to some larger superspace $K$ in which $H$ (and thereby $(f_k)$) was imbedded.

Why is $1/\text{undefined}=0$ and not undefined too? ii) The same here; $f(x)$ is undefined at $x=3$, but depending on which graphic calculator you use it defines  $$(f(3))^{-1}=0 $$ or as a discontinuity. *What happens at those ""magical"" points when $f(x)=\text{undefined}$ and $(f(x))^{-1}= 1/\text{undefined?}$ What I got so far: ""If y = f (x) = 0 for some value of x, then 1/f (x) is undefined.

Let phi be the plane with 360 points (0° to 359°) associated to the azimuth angle, and theta the one with 181 (0° to 180°) points associated to the elevation angle. R would instead be the value of the matrix by the coordinates phi and theta.

Now, suppose I have to rotate the 3D pattern by an elevation of delta degrees. Strictly reasoning on the matrix, which is the transformation I would have to perform?

Matrix2 shifts 20 positions down, therefore Matrix1 inherits the ""downward-displaced"" data from Matrix2 and Matrix2 the ""upward-displaced"" one from Matrix1. What is the correct transformation?

2347066,Calculate mean value from given data,"This question is about requesting some applicable algorithm rather than mathematical idea and is not part of any homework or study project. The solution may be obvious, but I can't see it by myself. Suppose you have a data of time and some possible events (stock prices, number of trading assets, volume of liquid through a pipe, number of people somehow -- whatever you wish) represented by a table such that this possible events somehow depend on each other. For example, suppose you a purchaser with some limited amount of money and data on a table represents possible value of offers from supplies. Then it is clear then the more you buy in the beginning the less you will be able to buy in a future because of possibility to run out of money. Or suppose you a trader in a stock market, who buy stock if he has no one and sell otherwise -- the situation is the same. My question is how can I algorithmically determine an expected mean value from such kind of data when I have no strategy and going to do things randomly? The problem at my point of view is that even for a $50$ rows table there would be $2^{50} = 1125899906842624$ possibilities of my behavior. On the other hand, I believe that this problem may naturally appear in many areas of applied mathematics in industry, so people somehow already solved it for a much bigger amount of data. I am expecting that anyone will provide and explain for me an algorithm which will avoid considerating $2^n$ possible pathes for $n$ rows table. Any ideas will be very appreciative. UPDATE : Let me clarify my problem in a simple example. Suppose that you have a list of ten elements, for example, let it be $\{14,15,8,6,7,3,19,25,9,15\}$. You pick the first element and then toss a fair coin: tail corresponds to the case when you pick second, and in case of head you do nothing. The expected value after such two steps is $Ex_2=0.5\cdot(14+0)+0.5\cdot(14+15)=\frac{43}{2}$. You repeat such procedure on each step, namely, after third we obtain
$$Ex_3=0.25\cdot(14+0+0)+0.25\cdot(14+0+8)+0.25\cdot(14+15+0)+0.25\cdot(14+15+8)=\frac{51}{2},$$ and so on. $Ex_n$ (expected mean value after $n$ steps) is given by a sum of $2^{n-1}$ summands that increases very quickly with increasing $n$. I'm interested is there a simple way to solve that kind of problem for any reasonable $n$ (say $50$ or $100$) without brute force calculation of all possible cases?
