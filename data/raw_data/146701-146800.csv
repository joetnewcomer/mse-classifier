2404372,Functions with other functions as their $x$-axis,"I had this interesting thought today as I was playing with making images with mathematical expressions (vector images with graphing if you like) I wanted to to put a spiky thing (the sine curve) around a circle (to make a sun with its rays). However, I have no idea on how to wrap the sine function around the circle (that is it would look like if the x-axis was arranged into a circle and the sine function was graphed on this bent axis). As I thought about this more, I even began to wonder how one would ""Wrap"" any arbitrary function/relation around another one, as it definitely seems possible, but it seems very hard to write down (I can easily draw a sine curve in a circle fashion, but I cannot write it's equation). It seems like, if this is possible, it would produce some very interesting curves.

2404422,Correct me if I am wrong : Bound the absolute value of sum of products using central limit theorem.,"I need to bind the value of a variable $\alpha$. $\alpha$ is defined as, $\alpha=a_0\cdot b_0 + a_1\cdot b_1 + a_2\cdot b_2 + \cdots +a_{n-1}\cdot b_{n-1}$. -  ( eq. 1 ) $a_i$'s are selected from a certain distribution with standard deviation $\sigma$ (for simplicity we can assume it a Gaussian distribution). And $b_i$'s are uniform random variable in $(-1/2,1/2]$. $a_i$'s and $b_i$'s are all independently sampled. Now,
$E[a^2]=\sigma^2$, as $\mu=0$ and similarly, $E[a^2]=\sigma_b^2=1/12$, also $\mu=0$.
Hence, $a_ib_i$ has mean $=0$ and $E[a^2b^2]=\sigma^2/12$.
Hence, from central limit theorem we can claim that $\alpha$ follows a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $=n\cdot\sigma^2/12$ standard deviation $=\sqrt{n/12}\cdot\sigma$. - (Eq. 2 ) The above part was explained nicely by Henry in this question . Now as $\alpha$ follows a Gaussian distribution we can claim using the Lemma 4.4 in this paper , that for $k>0$ $Pr[|\alpha|>k\sigma_\alpha : \alpha\leftarrow D_{\sigma_\alpha}]\leq 2e^{-k^2/2}$, Here, $\sigma_\alpha=\sqrt{n/12}\cdot\sigma$. - (eq. 3 ). Now, My question is suppose that there are two collections of $t\geq n$ numbers $A$ and $B$. Each element of $A$ is sampled independently from Gaussian with standard deviation $\sigma$ and each element of $B$ is chosen independently from the uniform distribution $(-1/2,1/2]$. Now, can I still claim that the relation in $eq. 3$ $\textit{i.e}$ $\alpha>k\sigma$ with probability $2\cdot e^{-k^2/2}$, holds if $\alpha$ is generated by choosing $n$ $a_i$'s and $b_i$'s from collection $A$ and $B$ respectively. As, each $a_i$ and $b_i$ is still independent of each other.

2404614,Prime numbers the rank of which is also a prime.,"$127$ has an interesting property:
It is the $31$st prime number and its rank ($31$) is also a prime.
$31$ is the $11$th prime so its rank is also a prime.
$11$ is also a prime number with a rank ($5$) that is also a prime.
$5$ is the 3rd prime number and and so its rank ($3$) is also a prime.

I am interested in this $O(1)$ term, which seems to be different from zero. Accordingly, studying the behaviour of the difference $S_K -1/2 \, \sqrt{K}\,\,\,$ over all integer values of $K$, its distribution is slightly shifted with respect to zero, and the average value seems to be $\approx -0.32... \,\,$. I tried several approaches to determine this constant term, mostly based on the Euler-Maclaurin formula, but without success. I wonder what this term is, and how it comes into this distribution.

The black line is the best fitting one and is set at a value of $\approx -0.32$. The second graph is a plot of the average value of $S_K - 1/2 \, \sqrt{K}\,$, calculated over the first $N$ positive integers, vs $N$. As expected according to the first graph, the average value of the difference converges towards $\approx -0.32$.","['number-theory', 'fractional-part', 'summation']"

Let $A_k\triangleq \{x:|f(x)|>M+\frac{1}{k}\}, k\in\mathbb N.$  Then $A=\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A_k$, and $A_{k}\subset A_{k+1}$.

But $\mu(E_n)\to 0$, since $f_n\to f$ in measure.  So $\mu(A_k)=0$ for any $k$, and hence $\mu(A)=0.$ Is this proof correct?  Are there flaws or simpler proof?

Each player can see only the colors of 99 hats worn by the rest of the team; no player can see the color of his or her own hat. The players are to guess the colors of their own hats, and if at least one player guesses correctly then the team as a whole wins. The players may not communicate in any way during the game, and they must all announce their guesses simultaneously. Find a strategy which will guarantee them success for every possible arrangement of hats. Answer from ""A dozen hat problems"" : Label the hat colors 0 to 99 and number the players 0 to 99. Have each player sum the colors she sees, working mod 100, and guess the color number that brings this sum up to the number she has been assigned as a player, again working on mod 100. I try n=3 using this strategy and found that one player will make a correct guess. But I still cannot figure out how this strategy comes. Please suggest. Thank you, Wildcard. Let $a_i$ be the hat color number of player numbered $i$, where $i\in\{0, 1, \ldots, 99\}$ (If player numbered $1$ wear the same color hat as player numbered $8$ , then $a_1 =a_8$) $a_0+a_1+\ldots+a_{99} \equiv k (\bmod{100})$, where $k\in\{0, 1, \ldots, 99\}$ so $a_k \equiv k-a_0-a_1-\ldots-a_{99}+a_k(\bmod{100})$ Therefore, the player whose hat color number is $a_k$ and is the player numbered $k$,  is the only one who makes the correct guess.

Therefore, I decided to go on the Wolfram Functions site, and look up some interesting properties of that function. One of them I especially found interesting was this one ( Formula 10.04.21.0001.01 ): $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{(3-\sqrt{8}\cos(\log(2)t))Z(t)^2}{t^2+\frac{1}{4}}~dt=\pi \log(2) \tag{1}$$ However, the site does not provide a proof of this result. Therefore, this leads me to my current question: Question: How can we prove $(1)$ ? In case one does not know the definition of $Z(t)$ , it can be defined as: $$Z(t)=e^{i\theta(t)}\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right),$$ where $\theta(\cdot )$ and $\zeta(\cdot )$ are the Riemann-Siegel Theta and Riemann Zeta functions respectively. One definition of $\theta(t)$ is: $$\theta(t) = \arg \left(\Gamma\left(\frac{2it+1}{4}\right)\right)- \frac{\log \pi}{2} t,$$ where $\Gamma(\cdot )$ is the Gamma function . My first thought was to use the fact that the integrand is even, then consider a contour $C$ going along the real line from $-a$ to $a$ then going counter-clockwise along a semicircle centered at $0$ going from $a$ to $-a$ . $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{(3-\sqrt{8}\cos(\log(2)t))Z(t)^2}{t^2+\frac{1}{4}}~dt=\frac{1}{2}\cdot PV\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{(3-\sqrt{8}\cos(\log(2)t))Z(t)^2}{t^2+\frac{1}{4}}~dt \tag{2}$$ Hence, we must consider: $$\lim_{a \to \infty}\int_{C} f(z)~dz=\lim_{a\to \infty}\left(\int_{-a}^a f(z)~dz+\int_{\text{arc}} f(z)~dz\right),$$ where $f(z)=\dfrac{(3-\sqrt{8}\cos(\log(2)z))Z(z)^2}{z^2+\frac{1}{4}}$ . I found two poles at $z=\pm \frac{i}{2}$ , but only $z=\frac{i}{2}$ is bounded by $C$ . The residue at that point can be evaluated easily since we know it is a simple pole: $$\operatorname*{Res}_{z=\frac{i}{2}} \dfrac{(3-\sqrt{8}\cos(\log(2)z))Z(z)^2}{z^2+\frac{1}{4}}=\lim_{z\to \frac{i}{2}} \frac{(3-\sqrt{8}\cos(\log(2)z))Z(z)^2}{z+\frac{i}{2}}=-\frac{1}{2}i\log(2)$$ I evaluated the above limit, then confirmed it using Wolfram|Alpha .
Multiplying by $2\pi i$ gives $\pi \log(2)$ . However, notice that my answer seems to be off by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ due to equation $(2)$ . Hence, I suspect that either $\lim\limits_{a \to \infty} \int_{\text{arc}}f(z)~dz\neq 0$ is the issue here, or that I missed one of the conditions necessary to apply the residue theorem.

Let $Z = X + Y$, so that $Z\sim N(\mu _{X}+\mu _{Y},\sigma _{X}^{2}+\sigma _{Y}^{2})$. I'm wondering what is $f_X(x \mid Z = z)$, i. e. the probability distribution of X given Z. I'm guessing that I can use the fact that $f_{X}(x\mid Z=z)f_{Z}(z)=f_{X,Z}(x,z)=f_{Z}(z\mid X=x)f_{X}(x)$, since I know $f_X$ and $f_Z$, and my intuition is that $f_{Z}(z\mid X=x)$ is just the probability distribution of a normal random variable with mean $x+\mu_Y$ and variance $\sigma _{Y}^{2}$, but I don't actually know the latter fact since I haven't proved it and so I'm not sure it's correct. Another possibility I have considered is to calculate $f_{X,Z}$ (and use that to derive $f_X(x \mid Z = z)$ by using $f_{X}(y\mid Z=z)={\frac {f_{X,Z}(x,z)}{f_{Z}(z)}}$), but I need $Cov(X,Z)$ for that, and I don't know what it is.

  only if the two sets, $S_1$ and $S_2$, are identical. This means that $ \left( A \cup B \right)\cap C = A \cup \left(B \cap C \right)$ if and only if $I_{\left( A \cup B \right)\cap C} = I_{A \cup \left(B \cap C \right)}$. $I_{\left( A \cup B \right)\cap C} = \left(I_A+I_B-I_A I_B\right)I_C = I_A I_C + I_B I_C - I_A I_B I_C$ $I_{A \cup \left(B \cap C \right)}= I_A + I_B I_C - I_A I_B I_C $ These 2 expressions are not always equal, therefore I conclude that these sets are not always identical.

2405984,"Prove that combinatorial (n,t) secret sharing has one efficient solution.","One method for threshold secret sharing involves splitting a secret into multiple parts and distributing it amongst $n$ people such that any subset of threshold $t$ members can reconstruct the secret, but no combination of $(t - 1)$ or fewer can do so. In order to ensure that any combination of $t$ members is guaranteed to have all parts of the secret, each part must be distributed to at least $(n - t + 1)$ people. It is inefficient to distribute 2 different parts to the same subset of people. There are $n\choose{n - t + 1}$ ways of distributing a part to this number of people and I have noticed that, for any $n$ and $t$, this is the same as the number of parts required to ensure no subset with $(t-1)$ can reconstruct the secret.

Show that $\mathbf{e_1} \cdot (\mathbf{e_2} \land \mathbf{e_3}) = 0$ This early in the text, $\cdot$ has only been defined for vectors, not for multivectors. The only relevant identities seem to be: $\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \land \mathbf{b}$ for pure vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ (presented as the fundamental identity ) The geometric product distributes over addition and is associative. Identities for the geometric product of vectors:
$$ \mathbf{a} \parallel \mathbf{b} \Rightarrow \mathbf{a} \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{b} \mathbf{a}$$
$$\mathbf{a} \bot \mathbf{b} \Rightarrow \mathbf{a} \mathbf{b} = - \mathbf{b} \mathbf{a}$$ Scalar multiplication identities for $\land$ and the geometric product I tried assuming that fundamental identity was not limited to 1-vectors, and applied to vector-bivector multiplication as well: $$
\begin{align}
aB       & = a \cdot B + a \land B  && \text{unmotivated generalization} \\
Ba       & = B \cdot a + B \land a  && \text{unmotivated generalization} \\
aB + Ba  & = a \cdot B + B \cdot a + a \land B + B \land a && \text{add and rearrange} \\

a \cdot B& = \frac 12 (aB + Ba) && \text{}\\

Both these problems seem to require a rule governing how $\cdot$ applies to vectors and bivectors (incorrect strawman: $\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b}\mathbf{c}) = (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}$). However, this more-general $\cdot$ is not presented until the next chapter. These two problems seem designed to teach or motivate something , but I don't see how they're soluble given the minimal set of definitions presented, at least not without the student trying to define their own generalization of the geometric product, $\cdot$, and/or $\land$ operators.

2406052,Automorphism of the Dynkin diagram,"I have a question about a passage from Springer's Linear Algebraic Groups (Birkhauser). The setup is: $F$ is an arbitrary field, $G$ is an $F$-split group, and $B$ is a Borel subgroup of $G$ containing a maximal $F$-torus $T$. This corresponds to a choice $R^+$ of positive roots. Let $D$ be the root basis. Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the Dynkin diagram defined by $D$. On page 276, Springer writes, ""An automorphism of $G$ stabilizing $B$ and $T$ and fixing the elements of the connected center $C$ induces an automorphism of $\mathcal{D}$."" My question is, if an automorphism of $G$ stabilizes $B$ and $T$, why doesn't it already induce an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram? My reasoning was that if $\sigma$ is the automorphism, then $\sigma$ preserves the minimal $T$-stable subspaces of the unipotent radical $R_u(B)$, namely the root subgroups $U_\alpha$ for $\alpha \in R^+$. This induces a permutation of the positive roots, which stabilizes the set of simple roots. Therefore one gets an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram.","['algebraic-groups', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2406432,"Compactness of the closed interval [0,1]","In general topology, a topological space is said to be compact, if every one of its open cover has a finite subcover.
However, I cannot see the compactness of the close interval [0,1] from the above definition.
To be a little specific,let us consider the following open cover for [0,1]: $C= \{[0,1/2),(1/3,3/4), (2/3,1]\}$. Now, the open interval (1/3,3/4) itself has at least one open cover (let's call it P) which does not have a finite subcover. We use P to cover the open interval (1/3,3/4). This gives a new open cover C' for the interval [0,1]. It looks like C' does not have an finite subcover, since C' includes P which does not have a finite subcover. Of course I misunderstood something here. If somebody can catch my error it will be very helpful.","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

2406448,"Principal Bundles, Chern Classes, and Abelian Instantons","I am attempting to make sense of Chern classes of principal bundles and associated bundles.  Let $\pi: P \to M$ be a principal $G$-bundle with $M$ a four-dimensional Riemannian manifold.  One canonical vector bundle associated to $P$ and the adjoint representation is the adjoint bundle $\text{ad}P = P \times_{\text{ad}} \mathfrak{g}$ where the fibers are identified with $\mathfrak{g}$ and the transition functions are given by the adjoint action. I understand characteristic classes in the context of vector bundles, so I'm satisfied to say that the adjoint bundle has topological invariants $\text{rank}(\mathfrak{g})$, $c_{1}(\text{ad}P)$, and $c_{2}(\text{ad}P)$.  Roughly speaking, one can think of these as measuring ""obstructions"" to $\text{ad}P$ being trivial.  More specifically, we have $$c_{1}(\text{ad}P) = \frac{i}{2 \pi} \big[\text{Tr}F_{A}\big] \,\,\,\,\,\, \text{and} \,\,\,\,\,\, c_{2}(\text{ad}P) = -\frac{1}{4 \pi^{2}}\big[ \text{Tr}(F_{A} \wedge F_{A})\big].$$ My first question is: does it make sense to talk about Chern classes of principal bundles themselves, or when someone speaks of such a thing, are they implicitly referring to the classes of the adjoint bundles? For example, the above Chern classes measure the obstruction of $\text{ad}P$ from being trivial.  Are there such classes which measure the failure of $P$ itself from being trivial? My second question is somewhat tangential but still related.  In algebraic geometry, on a complex surface $S$, one is interested in the instanton moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{N, c_{1}, c_{2}}(S)$ where $N, c_{1}, c_{2}$ are the rank, and first and second Chern classes of the bundles. These are the discrete moduli one fixes.  In order to get a nice moduli space, one often allows certain sheaves with those fixed invariants. For example, to formalize instantons with invariants $(N, c_{1}, c_{2})$ on $\mathbb{C}^{2} = \mathbb{R}^{4}$, one gets a compact moduli space by considering torsion-free sheaves of rank $N$ and those Chern classes on $\mathbb{P}^{2}$ with a framing at infinity.  In the case $N=1$, $c_{1}=0$, and $c_{2}=n$ (the instanton number) the moduli space of $U(1)$ instantons on $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ is given by the Hilbert scheme: $$\text{Hilb}^{n}(\mathbb{C}^{2}).$$ My second question is: how can $U(1)$ instantons have a non-zero second Chern class?  I understand that rank one sheaves can have a second Chern class, of course, but if $P$ is a $U(1)$ principal bundle, then $\text{ad}P$ cannot have a second Chern class. I would say that $U(1)$ instantons are trivial.  So if this giant Hilbert scheme is the moduli space of instantons it seems like you're not just throwing in a few degenerate objects, you're throwing in everything!

If we have a converging geometric series $a_n=aq^n, 0<q<1$ , $a>0$ , then for all $n\ge1$ $$a_n^{(n-1)/n}=a^{(n-1)/n}q^{n-1}\le Aq^{n-1}$$ with $A=\max\{1,a\}$ .
