768882,Power method for finding all eigenvectors,"This is my homework. I was asked to find all eigenvectors of a symmetric and positive definite matrix by inverse power method with shifted. I encountered three problems: The eigenvalues to the matrix may not be distinct. In this case, how to find all eigenvectors corresponding to one eigenvalue? By the inverse power method, I can find the smallest eigenvalue and eigenvector. However, it seems the inverse power method with deflation does not work for finding other eigenvalues. I think the reason is the deflation shift the largest eigenvalue to zero, and after I inverse the matrix, this eigenvalue goes to infinity and therefore it is impossible to find an infinite large eigenvalue. How to modified power method with deflation in the inverse case? How to use power method with deflation to find all eigenvector? I can find the largest (power method) and second largest (power method with deflation). My question is how to construct the ""modifed matrix"", i.e. $B = A$ minus some modifying term? $${}$$","['positive-definite', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'symmetric-matrices', 'matrices', 'numerical-linear-algebra']"

768984,"Showing that $f(x)=e^{-x}$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,\infty)$","I am trying to show that $f(x)=e^{-x}$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,\infty)$ and not having much success.  I'm attempting to use a modified version of the following result (which I found on Math Stack Exchange here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/172988/please-prove-uniform-continuity ), that if $f$ is continuous on $[a,\infty)$ and the limit of $f(x)=L$ as $x$ approaches infinity, then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,\infty)$. This is the work I've done so far.  I really don't know if it's valid reasoning...
The first problem I'm encountering is that the book has not yet defined functional limits, so I can't really use the proof directly.  We have, however defined sequential limits and the notion of a decreasing function.  If I define a sequence $x_n=n-1$ for $n$$\in$$\mathbb{N}$, then as $n$ goes to infinity, $f(x_n)\rightarrow0$.  For $\epsilon/2$, $\exists$N$\in$$\mathbb{N}$ s.th for all n $\geq$ N,  |$f(x_n)|$ <$\epsilon/2$. Then, since $f(x)$ is a decreasing function, this inequality holds for all $x$$\geq$$x_N$. 
Since $\mathcal{S}$=$[0,N+1]$ is closed and bounded, and hence a compact set in $\mathbb{R}$, and $f(x)=e^{-x}$ is continuous on $\mathcal{S}$, then by the Uniform Continuity Theorem, $f$ is uniformly continuous on $\mathcal{S}$. So, if $x,y$ $\in$$\mathcal{S}$,$\forall$$\epsilon>0,$ $\exists$ $\delta>0$ s.th |$x-y$|<$\delta$ then |$f(x)-f(y)$|<$\epsilon$.  Then (really not sure about this part), if $x, y$ $\in$$(N+1,\infty)$, for any $x$ and $y$ in this set, we have $|f(x)-f(y)|=|f(x)+(-f(y))|$$\leq|f(x)|+|f(y)|<\epsilon/2+\epsilon/2=\epsilon$.  So $f$ is uniformly continuous on $(N+1,\infty)$.  Provided this part is correct, I am having trouble with the case where $x$$\in[0,N+1]$ and $y$ $\in(N+1,\infty)$.  Provided it's not correct, I'm having trouble on that part as well.  Provided none of this is correct, well... I don't know. Any help would be appreciated.  Is this an appropriate way to approach the problem?  Are there other ways?",['real-analysis']

769159,Are $C^{k}$ manifolds the same as $C^{\infty}$ manifolds?,"This is a theorem of Hassler Whitney: For $0<k<\infty$ and any $n$-dimensional $C^k$ manifold the maximal
  atlas contains a $C^\infty$ atlas on the same underlying set. It seems to me that this theorem says every $C^{k}$ manifold can be thought of as if it were a $C^{\infty}$ manifold proceeding like this: Start with a given a $C^{k}$ atlas $\mathcal{A}$ on a topological
manifold $M$ Consider the maximal $C^{k}$ atlas $\overline{\mathcal{A}}$
containing $\mathcal{A}$ (i.e. the atlas containing every
$C^{k}$ chart on $M$ compatible with $\mathcal{A}$) Extract a $C^{\infty}$ subatlas $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ of
$\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ (it can be done because of Whitney's
theorem) Now make $M$ a $C^{\infty}$ manifold  considering the atlas
$\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ After this maneuver we ended up with two differentiable structures over the same underlying topological manifold $M$: one of $C^{k}$ type given by $\mathcal{A}$ and the other of $C^{\infty}$ type given by $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$. My questions are: Up to what extent are this two differentiable manifolds,
$(M,\mathcal{A})$ and $(M,\mathcal{A}_{\infty})$, the same? Is it true that the maximal atlas $\overline{\mathcal{A}_{\infty}}$
generated by $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ is the same as
$\overline{\mathcal{A}}$ with all the non $C^{\infty}$ charts
removed? Are there examples of $C^{k}$ manifolds for which exists a
$C^{k}$ atlas such that none of its charts is $C^{r}$ for some
$r>k$? When studying functions defined on a $C^{k}$ manifold $M$ we
can consider differentials up to order $k$, with this limit $k$
imposed by the $C^{k}$ differentiable structure. Is the theorem of Whitney

769178,Ramification index of infinite primes,"I am reading Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory. On page 184, Chapter 3, Neukirch defines the ramification index of infinite primes as follows:
For a finite extension $L/K$ of number fields, and an infinite prime $\mathfrak{B}$ lying over $\mathfrak{p}$, define the inertia degree resp. ramification index by $e_{\mathfrak{B}/\mathfrak{p}}=1$. But I am confused: in the case where $\mathfrak{p}$ comes from a real embedding $\sigma$, and $\mathfrak{B}$ comes from a complex (non-real) embedding $\tau$ extending $\sigma$, don't we say $\mathfrak{p}$ ramifies in $L$, because both $\tau$ and $\bar{\tau}$ extend $\sigma$? Thanks. Add: Neukirch also defines $f_{\mathfrak{B}/\mathfrak{p}}=[L_\mathfrak{B}:K_\mathfrak{p}]$ (loc. cit.) but I think the natural definitions analogues to finite cases should be $f_{\mathfrak{B}/\mathfrak{p}}=\log|\tau(x)|/\log|\sigma(x)|$ for some $x\in K_\mathfrak{p}^\times$, which always equals 1 for $\tau$ extending $\sigma$.

769362,Special Products of Transpositions,"[ Edit. Significantly expanded to add examples and (I hope) clarification. Feel free to skim by reading the gray boxes.] A colleague asked me for insights on a collection of special permutations, but I'm afraid the topic falls a little outside of my realm of expertise. The permutations in question can be described thusly: Permutations (on $n$ symbols) that are a product of $n$ transpositions with the cycle notation form $$(1,s_1)(2,s_2)(3,s_3)\cdots(n,s_n) \qquad\qquad (\star)$$ That is, the $i$th ""factor"" of the permutation exchanges the item at position $i$ with the item at position $s_i$, where we assume $i\neq s_i$. Note that $(\star)$ is a ""recipe"" for a permutation, not the permutation's decomposition into orbits. Note also that there are $(n-1)^n$ recipes, but only $n!$ permutations of $n$ symbols. Multiple recipes give rise to the same permutation. For instance, for $n=3$, we have $2^3=8$ recipes $(1a)(2b)(3c)$, resulting in just $3$ permutations:
$$\begin{align}
(12)(23)(31)&: 123 \to 213 \to 231 \to 132 \\
(12)(21)(32)&: 123 \to 213 \to 123 \to 132 \\
(13)(21)(31)&: 123 \to 321 \to 231 \to 132 \\ \\
(13)(23)(31)&: 123 \to 321 \to 312 \to 213 \\
(12)(23)(32)&: 123 \to 213 \to 231 \to 213 \\

(12)(21)(31)&: 123 \to 213 \to 123 \to 321 \\
(13)(23)(32)&: 123 \to 321 \to 312 \to 321
\end{align}$$ More briefly:
$$132\;(\times 3) \qquad 213\;(\times 3) \qquad 321\;(\times 2)$$
where the ""$(\times m)$"" gives the ""multiplicity"" of the permutation (ie, the number of recipes $(\star)$ that result in it). For $n=4$, we have $3^4=81$ recipes, yielding $12$ permutations: $$\begin{align}

\end{align}$$ And so forth. In the above, we get $n!/2$ permutations (which would necessarily mean: all the members of $S_n$ that match $n$'s parity), but it's not immediately obvious to me that this is always the case. (Certainly, we always get $n$'s-parity permutations, but do we always get all of them?) I'll point out that my colleague and I are primarily interested in even $n$ ---so that we're working within (if not with the entirety of) the alternating group, $A_n$--- but considering all $n$ may help reveal patterns. Now, my colleague and I are interested in counting the number of these special permutations ""with multiplicity"" that move items $i$, $j$, $k$ into positions $1$, $2$, $3$ (where $n \gg 3$). For instance, Among the permutations of the form $(\star)$ on the (English) alphabet, how many result in $26$-letter strings beginning with a $3$-letter word of my choosing, say, ""cat$\cdots$"" or ""dog$\cdots$""? (More generally, how many permutations yield strings starting with a $4$-, $5$-, or $m$-letter word of my choosing?) In terms of the permutations given above, I could ask questions like How many special permutations (with multiplicity) ... ... of $\phantom{45}123$ begin with $\phantom{495}2$? Answer: $\phantom{00}3$ ... of $\phantom{45}123$ begin with $\phantom{49}31$? Answer: $\phantom{00}0$* ... of $\phantom{5}1234$ begin with $\phantom{459}3$?

Answer: $\phantom{00}3$ ... of $12345$ begin with $\phantom{999}3$? Answer: $217$ ... of $12345$ begin with $\phantom{99}15$? Answer: $\phantom{4}42$ ... of $12345$ begin with $\phantom{9}321$? Answer: $\phantom{42}8$ ... of $12345$ begin with $2431$? Answer: $\phantom{42}0$* *The first $(n-2)$ entries in the permutation determine the last $2$ (this is clear from parity), so it's possible to specify length-$(n-1)$ beginning strings that never occur. (Not that that really matters to us. In our investigation, we want to specify beginning strings of length far less than $n$.) If all we wanted was to know the number of ways item $i$ can move into position $j$, then a fairly straightforward analysis of products of permutation matrices would do. Here are resulting tabulations for $n=3,4,5,6$, where the $(i,j)$th element counts the number of permutations (with multiplicity) that move item $i$ into position $j$.

\right)$$ One observes that the matrices are symmetric across the secondary diagonal. Less obviously, they indicate that there are $(n-1)^{n-1}-(n-2)^{n-1}$ ways for item $1$ to stay put, and $2(n-2)^{n-1}$ ways for item $1$ to move to position $n$. General formulas for other entries are somewhat trickier to express. These independent tallies are one thing, but I'm at a loss for how to count ""compound"" circumstances, such as (in the simplest case) $$\text{""# of ways ( item $i$ moves to position $1$ ) AND ( item $j$ moves to position $2$ )""}$$ Of course, ""brute force"" enumeration ---generating all the permutations, and counting the ones we want--- already becomes computationally intractable once $n$ nears $10$. Our suspicion is that there's effectively no good solution here. That said, it seems possible that the specific nature of the recipe $(\star)$ provides enough structure to facilitate such enumeration, perhaps through clever recursion or exploitation of some aspect of the symmetric group, $S_n$ (or, maybe, the alternating group, $A_n$). So, before my colleague shelves this particular puzzle, I thought I'd ask for pointers here. It would even be helpful to know Have these ""special permutations"" been studied in the literature? If it's true that the recipes $(\star)$ always give us half of the permutations in $S_n$, then this problem can be broken into two parts Find the $n$'s-parity members of $S_n$ that begin with a specified sequence. Count the number of ways a member of $S_n$ can be decomposed into form $(\star)$.","['permutations', 'group-theory', 'combinatorics']"

Assume working over an algebraically closed field $k$. Let $E$ be a locally free sheaf of rank $N+1$ over Y, which is nonsingular, and hence $\mathbb{P}(E)$ be a projective space bundle over $Y$. Let $X$ be a nonsingular variety with a flat morphism $\pi: X\rightarrow Y$. Now if there is a morphism $f: X\rightarrow \mathbb{P}(E)$ over Y, which induces an isomorphism on each fiber $f_y: X_y \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^N, \forall y \in Y$, then is the morphism $f$ itself also an isomorphism? I think the statement should be true. In fact, if I can get a compatible local trivialization of $X$ over $Y$ like that of $\mathbb{P}(E)$, then this statement is actually the definition of an isomorhpism between fiber bundles. I am also considering a more general question. Let $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ be nonsingular varieties, and there is a morphism $f: X\rightarrow Y$ over $Z$ which induces isomorphism on each fiber $f_z: X_z \rightarrow Y_z$. Then when is $f$ an isomorphism itself. Is it enough for me to assume $X\rightarrow Z$ and $Y\rightarrow Z$ are flat (or smooth to be stronger)? or maybe the question is easier when $Z$ is a curve?

  number $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a corresponding number $\delta>0$

However, my Introduction to Real Analysis: Bartle and Sherbert , gives: Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, and let $a$ be a cluster point of $A$.
  For a function $f: A \mapsto \mathbb{R}$, a real number $L$ is said to be a limit of $f$ at $a$, if given any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that if $x \in A$ and $0<|x-a|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon$. Now my problem is when considering, for example, if $f: A \mapsto \mathbb{R}$, where $A=\{ x: x \text{ is irrational} \}$, and $f(x)=0$. By Stewart's definition, $f$ can't be defined on any open interval around $0$, as there will always be a rational number in it. So it fails the first condition, and $\lim_{x\to 0} f(x)$ is not defined. However, according to the definition of cluster point, there will always be one irrational $x$ that satisfies $0<|x-0|<\delta$ for every $\delta<0$. Hence $0$ would be a cluster point. Now, if $x\in A$, i.e. if $x$ is irrational and $0<|x|<\delta$ then obviously $0<\varepsilon$. So $\lim_{x\to 0} f(x)=0$. What is going on?","['definition', 'calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

My branch cut for log(z) is from $0<\theta<2\pi$ for $z=re^{i\theta}$. So far I have:
$$\int_{\delta D}\frac{\log(z)}{z^a(z+1)}dz=\int^R_{\epsilon}\frac{\log(x)}{x^a(x+1)} dz+\int_{\Gamma_R} \frac{\log(z)}{x^a(z+1)}dz+\int_R^{\epsilon} \frac{\log(x)}{e^{i2\pi a}x^a(x+1)}dx+\int_{\gamma_\epsilon} \frac{\log(z)}{z^a(z+1)}dz$$
Using ML-estimates, I can show the two gamma integrals go to zero as epsilon and R go to zero and infinity. Also, by the residue theorem,
$$\int_{\delta D}\frac{\log(z)}{z^a(z+1)}dz=2\pi i\sum Res[\frac{\log(z)}{z^a(z+1)},-1]=2\pi i\frac{i\pi}{e^{i\pi a}}=-\frac {2\pi^2}{e^{i\pi a}}$$
Putting this together with the previous equation we get:
$$\int^R_{\epsilon}\frac{\log(x)}{x^a(x+1)} dz=-\frac {2\pi^2}{e^{i\pi a}}(1-\frac{1}{e^{i2\pi a}})$$ Now I am lost on how to show the above equation. Any hints?","['residue-calculus', 'complex-analysis']"

770418,Proposition II.$3.2$ in Hartshorne,"In Proposition II. (3.2) of Hartshorne book ""algebraic geometry"". I can't understand proof of part. Proposition: A scheme $X$ is locally Noetherian iff for every open
affine $U = \rm Spec A$, $A$ is a Noetherian ring. It suffices to prove that if $X$ is locally Noetherian, and $U =
\rm Spec A$ is an open affine subset then $A$ is a Noetherian ring.
We first show that $U$ is locally Noetherian. Suppose that $V =\rm Spec B$
is an open affine on $X$ where $B$ is a Noetherian ring. Then $U\cap V$ can
be covered by open sets of the form $D(f)\cong\rm Spec(B)$, where $f\in B.$ As $B$
is a Noetherian ring then so is $B_f.$ As open sets of the form $V$ cover
$X,$ $U$ is covered by open affines, which are the spectra of Noetherian
rings. So $U$ is locally Noetherian. Replacing $X$ by $U,$ $^{(1)}$ we are reduced to proving that if $X =\rm Spec A$
locally Noetherian then $A$ is Noetherian.  Let $V =\rm Spec B,$ be an open
subset of $X$ , where $B$ is a Noetherian ring. Then there is an element
$f\in A$ such that $D(f)\subset V .$ Let $\bar f$ be the image of $f$ in $B.$ $^{(2)}$ Then $A_f\cong B_{\bar f}$   whence $A_f$ is Noetherian.
So we can cover $X$ by open subsets  $D(f)\cong \rm {Spec}$$(A_f).$ Since $X$ 
is quasi-compact, a finite number will do. I don't see why we may replace $X$ by $U$ ? and how we reduce to prove that if $X =\rm Spec A$
locally Noetherian then $A$ is Noetherian. I don't understand what he mean by ""image of $f$ in $B$"" and why $A_f\cong B_{\bar f}.$ Thank you.",['algebraic-geometry']

They approach the problem heuristically, and the algorithm they use is: start with two adjacent disks, and then keep adding the $(n+1)$th disk such that (a) it is tangential to at least one of the other $n$ disks, and (b) it minimizes $U_{n+1}|U_n$. Algorithms like these are called "" greedy algorithms ,"" and while they do not guarantee optimal solutions, they tend to give good approximations when the fitness landscape is sufficiently nice. Now, I would like to prove that this algorithm is ""justified"" (not correct - it's not! - justified ), i.e. that for a minimal $U$, each disk must be tangential to at least one other disk . While this is intuitively ""obvious,"" I am finding it tricky to approach formally. I am thinking along the lines of ""show that if there is an optimal solution where one disk is not tangential to another disk, then the solution can be improved by making it so."" But  how about situations like these: Moving the disk in the middle will clearly increase $U$. Of course, you'll say, this is only because the arrangement is not optimal in the first place; but then again, we only know this intuitively, so we're back to square one. My other thought is to use induction, but this brings us back to the problem of the greedy algorithm: a solution for $n$ says nothing about the solution for $n+1$. I am well aware that circle packing problems are in general very hard; in fact, exact solutions only exist for very small $n$.

Speaking of which, why is it not true for those values (unless the spaces are singletons of course)? EDIT: I know this is a duplicate, but the other post contains 2 incorrect answers only.","['convex-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
770724,"Discontinuous function in $W^{1, 1}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$","What's an example of a bounded function in $W^{1, 1}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ which is discontinuous? Can this function be discontinuous on a set of positive measure?","['sobolev-spaces', 'analysis']"
770729,Show that $A=0 \iff \operatorname{tr}(A)=0$ where $A= M_1+ \cdots +M_{\ell}$. [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : A Representation Theory Problem in Putnam Competition (1 answer) Closed 5 years ago . Let $G=\{M_1, M_2, \ldots ,M_{\ell}\} \subset \mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{R})$, such that $G$ forms a group for the usual matrix multiplication. Denote $A= M_1+ \cdots +M_{\ell}$. Show that  $$A=0 \iff \operatorname{tr}(A)=0$$ I am totally stuck here, if someone has any ideas, please share it. Thank you in advance.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
770763,Limit of a sequence defined by a two-step nonlinear recursion,"Let $x_0, x_1$ be positive numbers and define $$x_{n+2}=x_{n+1}+\frac{1}{x_n + \sqrt{n}}$$ Prove that the sequence $y_n = x_n / \sqrt{n} \to 1 \\ \\ \\$. My attempt: I think it would suffice to consider the inequalities $x_n < \sqrt{n}$ and $x_n > \sqrt{n}$. From the given recursion, we would then extract $$x_{n+2} - x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{x_n + \sqrt{n}} > \frac{1}{2\sqrt{n}}$$ (flip the inequality in the other case) and compute $y_n$ from this. But the issue here is that I can't find the necessary limit in both cases.",['sequences-and-series']
770805,Compact operator on invariant subspace is compact,"Statement: Let $T \in \mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$, where $T$ is a compact operator. Let $M$ be a closed invariant subspace of $T$. Show that the restriction of $T$ to $M$ is compact. Attempted Proof: Let $\{m_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a bounded sequence in $M$. Since $T$ is compact it contains a convergent subsequence $T(m_{n_k}) \rightarrow \mu$. Now since $M$ is closed and invariant under $T$ it contains all of its limit points, so $\mu \in M$. Hence we are compact. Q.E.D.","['operator-theory', 'proof-verification', 'analysis', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
770816,How do you work with infinitesimal exponents in synthetic differential geometry?,"I just read this paper by Andrej Bauer , which discusses the basic tenets of synthetic differential geometry. Namely, that for any function $f$, any real number $x$, and any infinitesimal $\epsilon$ (a number which squares to $0$), there is a unique number $f'(x)$ such that $$f(x + \epsilon) = f(x) + f'(x)\epsilon$$ This allows us to simply prove some of the most useful high-school deriviatives. But, I am wondering about differentiating the function $f(x) = e^x$. Plugging it in, I get $f(x + \epsilon) = e^{x + \epsilon}$, but I'm not sure how to reduce this into the form $e^x + e^x\epsilon$. In general, how do we handle infinitesimal exponents $a^\epsilon$?","['calculus', 'topos-theory', 'derivatives']"
