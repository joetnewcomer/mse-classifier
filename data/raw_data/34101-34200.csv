325179,Confidence Intervals for an Exponential Distribution,"$y_{1}$ is distributed $f_{Y}(y\mid\theta) = \theta e^{-\theta y} I_{(0, \infty)}(y)$, where $\theta > 0$. Analyze the confidence interval for $\frac{1}{\theta}$ given by $[L(Y), U(Y)] = [Y, 2Y]$. 1: Determine the confidence coefficient of this interval. $\bf{Thoughts:}$ I realized that my single data point is distributed $\textit{exponential}(\beta=\frac{1}{\theta}) = \textit{gamma}(\alpha = 1, \beta = \frac{1}{\theta})$. So I did the following steps to get my confidence coefficient: $$\
P_{\theta}(\frac{1}{\theta}\in [Y, 2Y])\\
= P_{\theta}(Y \leq \frac{1}{\theta} \leq 2Y)\\
= P_{\theta}(\frac{1}{2\theta} \leq Y \leq\frac{1}{\theta})\\
= \int\limits_{\frac{1}{2\theta}}^{\frac{1}{\theta}} \! \theta e^{-\theta y} \mathrm{d}y\\
= e^{-.5} - e^{-1}\\
= .23865$$ So I got .23685 as my confidence coefficient, and I'm fairly confident that that is the correct answer. 2: Determine the expected length of this interval. $\bf{Thoughts:}$ So I'm not too sure what to do here, but this is what I have written down. $$\
P_{\theta}(\frac{1}{\theta}\in [Y, 2Y])\\
= P_{\theta}(Y \leq \frac{1}{\theta} \leq 2Y)\\
= P_{\theta}(\frac{1}{2\theta} \leq Y \leq \frac{1}{\theta})\\
= P(e^{-1} \leq Y \leq e^{-.5}) = .23865$$ Since my 'a' and 'b' values were $e^{-1}$ and $e^{-.5}$, respectively. Now I don't know where to go from there to find the expected length. Do I use the gamma probability table? Any help would be greatly appreciated. 3: Find a different confidence interval for $\frac{1}{\theta}$ with the exact same confidence coefficient, but the expected length is smaller than part 2's expected length. Find an interval where the characteristics, same confidence coefficient and expected length is smaller than part 2's, are satisfied. $\bf{Thoughts:}$ I let $W = Y^{\frac{1}{\theta}}$, and I performed the transformation to get the distribution of W, and I ended with:
$$\
f_{W}(w\mid \theta) = \theta^{2} e^{-\theta w^{\theta}}w^{\theta -1}$$, which I think looks sorta like the gamma distribution, but then I don't know what to do from there. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

325208,The boundary of a region for complex-valued functions,"From Chapter $3$ of Stein and Shakarchi's complex analysis book, we have the following problem ($15$): Show that if $f$ is holomorphic in the unit disc (open), bounded, and converges uniformly to zero in the sector $\theta<\arg z<\varphi$ as $|z|\to1$, then $f=0$. We're supposed to use either the Cauchy inequalities or maximum modulus principle (per the instructions at the beginning, since this is a $4$-part problem), but I don't quite see how to do it using either of those, though the structure of the problem seems to lend itself to the maximum modulus principle. The problem with this is that we know that in the interior of the sector, the function cannot attain a maximum modulus, however, we don't know anything about the boundary of the sector that is in the interior of the circle. This is one obstacle I couldn't quite overcome. My approach was to extend the function past the boundary of the circle, which we can do since $f$ is bounded (I think, though even this part is a little bit 'hand-wavy'), and then, since it has a cluster of zeros, the function will be identically zero. How should I approach the problem with the intention of using the maximum modulus principle or Cauchy inequalities? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks! EDIT: I've been thinking about this problem, and I've come up with the following solution: Let $f$ be an analytic function on $\mathbb{D}$ (take note that I'm not assuming $f$ is bounded), with the property that for $\theta<\arg z<\varphi$, $|f(z)|$ converges to zero uniformly as $|z|\to1$ in this sector. Then we can make a 'bump' on the disc in this sector so that it extends in this outside of $\mathbb{D}$, call this set $\Omega'$. Define $$g(z)=\begin{cases}f(z)&:\,z\in\Bbb D\\0 &:z\notin\Bbb D\end{cases}.$$ Now, clearly in $\Bbb D$ $g(z)$ is holomorphic and outside of $\Bbb D$, it's holomorphic as it's constant, so the only questionable part would be on the boundary of the disc in this sector. At this point, we can take a small disc around each point entirely contained in $\Omega'$, since it's open, and apply Morera's theorem to show that $g(z)$ is holomorphic here. Therefore, on all of $\Omega'$, $g$ is holomorphic and has a cluster of zeros, hence is identically equal to zero, therefore $f(z)=0$. Is this proof correct? Or did I miss something and there is a counterexample when $f$ is not bounded? If it is correct, it's nice in that the proof didn't rely on the shape of the region at all, only on the fact that there was a nondegenerate connected subset of the boundary with the property. Therefore, we see the exercise as a very special case of the generalized problem.",['complex-analysis']
325218,types of functions between metric spaces,"Let $X,Y$ be metric spaces (by metric space I mean $(X,d)$ with $d:X\times X\to [0,\infty ]$ satisfying the triangle inequality, symmetry and $d(x,x)=0$). The following definitions for a function $f:X\to Y$ are well-known: 1) $f$ is nonexpanding if $d(f(x),f(x'))\le d(x,x')$. 2) $f$ is Lipschitz if there exist a constant $C>0$ such that $d(f(x),f(x')) < C\cdot d(x,x')$. 3) $f$ is uniformly continuous if for all $\epsilon >0 $ there is $\delta >0$ such that if $d(x,x')< \delta $ then $d(f(x),f(x'))< \epsilon $. 4) $f$ is continuous if for all $x\in X$ and $\epsilon > 0$ there is $\delta >0$ such that if $d(x,x')< \delta $ then $d(f(x),f(x'))< \epsilon$. 5) $f$ is large scale Lipschitz if there exist constants $C,A$ such that $d(f(x),f(x')) < C\cdot d(x,x') + A$. 6) $f$ is bornologous if for all $R>0$ there is $S>0$ such that if $d(x,x')<R$ then $d(f(x),f(x')) < S$. 7) $f$ is weak bornologous if there exist $R,S>0$ such that if $d(x,x')<R$ then $d(f(x),f(x')) < S$. Clearly $1\implies 2 \implies 3 \implies 4$ and $5\implies 6 \implies 7$. A definition I did not find written anywhere is the following. First an auxiliary concept: a function $\alpha : [0,\infty ]\to [0,\infty ]$ satisfying $\alpha (0)=0$, $\alpha$ is nondecreasing, $\alpha (s+t)\le \alpha (s)+\alpha (t)$, and for all $\epsilon >0$ there is $\delta >0 $ such that $\alpha (\delta )<\epsilon $ shall be called a distance distortion function. Any distance distortion function associates with any metric space $X$ a new metric space, $\alpha _*(X)$, with the same underlying set, and with distance function $\alpha_*(d):X\times X\to [0,\infty ]$, given by $\alpha _*(X)(x,x')=\alpha (d(x,x'))$. 2.5) say that $f$ is relatively nonexpanding if there exists a distance distortion function $\alpha$ such that $f:\alpha _*(X)\to Y$ is nonexpanding. It is clear that $2\implies 2.5 \implies 3$. So my questions are: Does the concept given by definition 2.5 have a name, if so, any references will be greatly appreciated. Is the list of concepts above a complete list of notions for structure preserving functions between metric spaces, for sensible notions of structure (e.g., above, rigid metric preservation, weaker metric preservations, uniform preservation, continuity, and the large scale notions). Thanks! Later addition: Condition 2.5 is known as a function admitting a special modulus of continuity, in particular subadditive/concave (thanks @5pm for that information, thus answering my first question).","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

325228,Solving laplace's equation for an inviscid and incompresible fluid,"Background I'm working on a 2D inviscid, incompressible fluid sim using vortex methods (that is, treating vortex as discrete particles), and I'm trying to (numerically) solve the no-through boundary conditions, which simply say that the fluid isn't allowed to pass through boundaries of the fluid (which means either the walls of its container or bodies floating in the fluid).  A couple of different sources I have suggest one way of doing it: construct a scalar field such that its gradient stops the fluid flow at the boundaries.  ie: $$\nabla \Phi \cdot \mathbf{n} = (\mathbf{u_b} - \mathbf{u_\omega}) \cdot \mathbf{n}$$ where $\Phi$ is the scalar field I need to find, $\mathbf{u_\omega}$ is the velocity field of the fluid without the boundary conditions, $\mathbf{u_b}$ is the velocity of the boundary itself, and $\mathbf{n}$ is the normalized surface normal of the boundary. Because the flow is incompressible, $\Delta \Phi = 0$ (ie: Laplace's equation).  A source I have (""Vortex Methods, Theory and Practice"") says you can solve this using a superposition of Green's functions.  This looks like: $$\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \mathbf{n}}(\mathbf{x_b}) = \pm \frac{1}{2} \sigma(\mathbf{x_b}) + \int_S{[\sigma(\mathbf{x_b'}) G(\mathbf{x_b} - \mathbf{x_b'}) -\mu(\mathbf{x_b'}) \mathbf{n} \cdot \nabla G(\mathbf{x_b} - \mathbf{x_b'})] dS(\mathbf{x_b'})}$$ where $\mathbf{x_b}$ is a point on the boundary, $G(\mathbf{x_b} - \mathbf{x_b'})$ is Green's function, and in 2D is $-\frac{\log(|\mathbf{x_b} - \mathbf{x_b'}|)}{2 \pi}$, and $S$ is the boundary I'm trying to prevent the fluid from going through (ie: in 2D it's a polygon's border).  Also: $$\mu = \Phi_e - \Phi_i$$ That is, it's the difference in the potential ($\Phi$) on opposite sides of the boundary.  The book refers to this as the ""double-layer potential"".  And: $$\sigma = \frac{\partial \Phi_e}{\partial \mathbf{n}} - \frac{\partial \Phi_i}{\partial \mathbf{n}} $$ The book refers to this as the single-layer potential or ""source"". Then the book assumes that the potential is continuous, so we can say that $\mu = 0$.  A large term in the integral above cancels, and we're finally left with: Final equation $$(\mathbf{u_b} - \mathbf{u_\omega}) \cdot \mathbf{n}(\mathbf{x_b}) = -\frac{1}{2} \sigma(\mathbf{x_b}) + \int_S{\sigma(\mathbf{x_b'}) G(\mathbf{x_b} - \mathbf{x_b'}) dS(\mathbf{x_b'})}$$ Questions First, if anyone has any background in fluids or potential, is the above description correct?  This isn't math I was ever formally taught and I'm just kind of piecing it together as I go. Also if I understand correctly, in order to actually solve this I need to ""discretize"" this integral to turn it in to a system of algebraic equations, form a big matrix, and solve it for the $\sigma$ terms.  One simple way of doing this would be to simply select $n$ evenly spaced points along the border of the polygon (is that right?). However, I don't understand what the $\sigma$ term actually is.  In the definition it looks like it's the Jacobian of $\Phi$ with respect to the normal, which would make it a row vector.  But in the above final equation, it seems to be treating it as a scalar term. Also, once I have the $\sigma$ terms, what do I actually do with them?  Ultimately I want to calculate $\nabla \Phi (\mathbf{x})$ for some arbitrary point in space $\mathbf{x}$, but I don't see how to do that once you have the $\sigma$ terms. I found an article on the double-layer potential with math that looks very familiar, so I'm guessing this is a well understood problem, but I'm certainly not understanding it :).  If someone can walk me through the final pieces of math so I can get to a point where I can actually program this, I'd appreciate it.","['multivariable-calculus', 'physics', 'fluid-dynamics', 'harmonic-functions', 'numerical-methods']"
325234,Sets with measure zero are closed under countable unions,"If $(X,\chi,\mu)$ is a measure space and $Z = \{ E \in \chi \mid \mu(E)=0 \}$ then $Z$ is closed under countable union. In the other parts to this question, I showed that given any $E \in \chi$ and $F \in Z$ that $E \cap F \in Z$ which followed from $E \cap F \subseteq E$. We also showed that this $Z$ is not a $\sigma$-algebra. By previously shown theorems if we have an increasing sequence $(E_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ then the measure of the union of the $E_n$'s is the limit of $\mu(E_n)$ and if the sequence is decreasing with $\mu(E_1) \neq +\infty$ then the measure of the intersection of the $E_n$'s is the limit of $\mu(E_n)$. I have been trying to attack this by cases but I am kind of having trouble distinguishing exactly what cases I have left. I know if it eventually becomes increasing or decreasing I will be done as the limit will be $0$ or if the sequences are pairwise disjoint, then it is just the sum of the measures which is $0$. I suspect that there is something I can maybe do like rewrite the sequence as the difference of sets and then maybe use $\mu(X \setminus A) = \mu(X)-\mu(A)$.",['measure-theory']

325255,Vector Bundle Over Contractible Manifold,"The problem comes from Liviu Nicolaescu's book Lectures on the Geometry of Manifolds . He asks the reader to prove that any vector bundle $E$ over $\mathbb{R}^n$ is trivializable. The idea he gives is to fix a connection $\nabla$ on $E$ and use the parallel transport to identify fibers over nonzero points with the fiber over $0$. Searching around, I've found proofs online that proceed in this way, using specifically the parallel transport over lines through the origin. I've also found a proof sketch on page 15 of John D. Moore's Lectures on Seiberg-Witten Invariants , showing that any vector bundle over a contractible manifold is trivializable: This sketch also uses the parallel transport along lines. The trouble I'm having has to do with the smoothness of this procedure. Perhaps it follows from the theory of differential equations that fibers over points which are close together will be identified with $E_0$ in a similar (smooth) way. I can accept that, even if I don't fully understand (my background in differential equations is basically nil). But then I still struggle with the question of why this doesn't work for any path connected manifold. For example, given a bundle over the torus, say, why can't I fix a connection, fix a point $0$, fix a collection of curves starting at $0$ and indexed by their ending point $m$, and then use the parallel transport to identify all fibers with the fibers over $0$?

325294,Hatcher - simplicial and quotient representations of spheres,"I am reading chapter 2 of Hatcher's algebraic topology text.

These both seem intuitively clear to me in low dimensions. For example, for the second part, taking two line segments and gluing them together at their ends produces a circle.

325364,Intuition for the Importance of Modular Forms,"I am learning about modular forms for the first time this term and am just starting to wrap my head around what might be the big picture of things. I was wondering if the following interpretation of why modular forms are important is correct a) technically and b) in terms of getting the right picture. Possible Intuition for Importance of Modular Forms: We want arithmetic data about elliptic curves. Given a congruence subgroup $$\Gamma\in\{\Gamma_1(N),\Gamma_0(N),\Gamma(N)\}$$
  we let $X(\Gamma)$ denote $\Gamma/\mathfrak{h}^\ast$ (where $\mathfrak{h}^\ast$ is the upper half-plane $\mathfrak{h}$ union the cusps $\mathbb{Q}\cup\{\infty\}$). We know then that $X(\Gamma)$ is the compactification of a moduli space whose points classify elliptic curves with some torsion data. Because of this, we want to understand the geometry of $X(\Gamma)$ because hopefully this will translate, via the moduli space concept, back to arithmetic data about elliptic curves. But, given a compact Riemann surface, one ideologically gets a lot of the information concerning the surface by studying meromorphic sections of certain holomorphic line bundles over $X$. A very natural line bundle attached to $X(\Gamma)$ is $(T_{X(\Gamma)}^{\ast1,0})^{\otimes n}$ (which is the $n^{\text{th}}$-tensor power of its holomorphic cotangent bundle). Thus, a natural place to look for geometric information about $X(\Gamma)$ is in the meromorphic sections of this bundle, denoted $\Omega^{\otimes n}(X(\Gamma))$. More specifically one may focus on the holomorphic sections $H^0(X(\Gamma),(T_{X(\Gamma)}^{\ast1,0})^{\otimes n})$ of this line bundle. That said, the natural equivalence map $\pi:\mathfrak{h}\to X(\Gamma)$ gives rise to the pullback map $\pi^\ast:\Omega^{\otimes n}(X(\Gamma))\to\Omega^{\otimes n}(\mathfrak{h})$. But, since $\mathfrak{h}$ has only one chart, we can naturally identify $\Omega^{\otimes n}(\mathfrak{h})$ with $\text{Mer}(\mathfrak{h})$. Thus, we have a linear embedding $\pi^\ast:\Omega^{\otimes n}(X(\Gamma))\to \text{Mer}(\mathfrak{h})$. Since $\text{Mer}(\mathfrak{h})$ is easier to deal with (at least its easier to ""see"") we would like to identify the objects of interest, $\Omega^{\otimes n}(X(\Gamma))$ and its subspace $H^0(X(\Gamma),(T_{X(\Gamma)}^{\ast 1,0})^{\otimes n})$, with their image under $\pi^\ast$. That said, one can prove that the image under $\pi^\ast$ of $\Omega^{\otimes n}(X(\Gamma))$ is $\mathcal{A}_{2n}(\Gamma)$ (the automorphic forms of weight $2n$ with respect to $\Gamma$) and the image of $H^0(X(\Gamma),(T_{X(\Gamma)}^{\ast 1,0})^{\otimes n})$ is contained in $\mathcal{M}_{2n}(\Gamma)$ (the modular forms of weight $2n$ with respect to $\Gamma$). Ok, assuming the above is correct, there are three questions that begged to be asked: Why do we care about all of $\mathcal{M}_{2n}(\Gamma)$? Why don't we care more specifically about the image of $H^0(X(\Gamma),(T_{X(\Gamma)}^{\ast 1,0})^{\otimes n})$ under $\pi^\ast$? Can we describe this image (e.g. it's the cups forms for $n=1$)? What do odd weight modular or automorphic forms tell us? If $-I\in\Gamma$ then there are no non-zero such objects, but in the cases when $-I\notin\Gamma$, do we gain anything by looking at odd weights? What does the geometry of $X(\Gamma)$ tell us about elliptic curves? For example, the genus of $X(\Gamma)$ tells us things about the objects we parameterize. That said, we don't need to study sections of line bundles to get this geometric data. Indeed, the genus for $X_0(1)$ can be deduced from the fact that the $j$-invariant has one simple pole, and thus must be induced a biholomorphism $j:X_0(1)\to\mathbb{P}^1$. From there, we can find the genus of $X(\Gamma)$ by using the natural projection $X(\Gamma)\to X_0(1)$ and the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. So, what geometric information about $X(\Gamma)$ is important that one needs automorphic/modular forms to get? Thank you so, so much friends! I have been grappling with the ""big picture"" of modular forms of late, and this is the best I cam up with. I am very excited to hear your responses!","['modular-forms', 'intuition', 'number-theory']"

325386,Further clarification needed on proof invovling generating functions and partitions (or alternative proof),"Show with generating functions that every positive integer can be written as a unique sum of distinct powers of $2$.

$$
g^*(x) = (1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^4)\cdots (1+x^{2^k}) \cdots.
$$ Then I don't understand where the following comes from: To show that every integer can be written as a unique sum of disticnt powers of $2$, we must show that the coefficient of every power of $x$ in $g^*(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots = (1-x)^{-1} $ or equivalently, $(1-x)g^*(x)=1$. Then they use the identity $(1-x^k)(1+x^k) = 1 - x^{2k}$ to manipulate $g^*(x)$:
$$\begin{align*}
(1-x)g^*(x) &= (1-x)(1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^4)(1+x^8)\cdots\\

The context for this question is my trying to grapple with a proof given in Schervish's Theory of Statistics (1995) (Lemma B. 40, p. 621)) to the claim that a Polish space is a Borel Space. The proof proceeds by showing that a Polish space is bi-measurable with $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, which was proved previously to be a Borel space. The bi-measurable function is called $f$ and is defined thus $$f:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^\infty,\space\space f(x):=\left(d\left(x,y_1\right),d\left(x,y_2\right),\dots\right)$$
where $\left\{y_1, y_2,\dots\right\}\subset\mathcal{X}$ is dense in $\mathcal{X}$ and $d$ is the metric on $\mathcal{X}$. To show that $f$ is measurable, Schervish points to the fact that $f$ is continuous, since each of its coordinates is continuous. However the implication ""$f$ is continuous $\implies$ $f$ is measurable"" is only valid if the product topology is contained in the $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, hence my question.","['general-topology', 'measure-theory']"

What is the probability that maximum speed differs from
the mean value by at most 1.5 standard deviations? I am working on part c), at the moment. How I calculated it was in terms of the adjusted mean and deviation: $P( \mu - \sigma \le Z \le \mu + \sigma) = P(-\sigma \le Z \le \sigma) = P(-1.5 \le Z \le 1.5) = \phi(1.5) - \phi(-1.5)$ This doesn't lead to the correct answer.

325793,Prove that a sequence converges to a finite limit iff lim inf equals lim sup,"This problem is purely for my own benefit, so I'd appreciate it if you offer help but don't spoil the proof for me. I've worked out the following solution, but I want to make sure that my reasoning doesn't have any holes in it: Suppose we have the sequence $\{a_n\}$, and $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\{a_n\}=L$. Then given $\epsilon>0$, we can choose $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$$\left| a_n-L \right|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$$
for every term $a_n \in \{a_n\}$ such that $n>N$. Now for $\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}$, (that is, to my understanding, the infimum of the sequence with the first N terms truncated) we must have some $a_{low} \in \{a_n|n>N\}$ such that
$$a_{low}-\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$$
because otherwise $\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}-\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ would be a greater lower bound for $\{a_n|n>N\}$. Similar reasoning demonstrates that we must have some $a_{high}$ such that
$$\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}-a_{high}<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$$
Now since $a_{high} \in \{a_n|n>N\}$, we must have
$$-\epsilon<a_{high}-L<\epsilon$$
and, adding this inequality to the above one gives
$$-\epsilon<\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}-L<\epsilon$$
for $n>N$, and therefore $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}=L$. Likewise, since $a_{low} \in \{a_n|n>N\}$ we must have
$$\left|a_{low}-L\right|=\left|L-a_{low}\right|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$$
So
$$-\frac{\epsilon}{2}<L-a_{low}<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$$
and adding this gives to the second inequality gives
$$-\epsilon<L-\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}<\epsilon$$
for $n>N$. So we have $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}=\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}=L$. Now conversely assume that $\lim \inf=\lim \sup$. We have
$$\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\} \leq a_n \leq \sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}$$
for $a_n \in \{a_n|n>N\}$. Since the limits of the left and right sides of the inequality are equal, the limit of the middle exists and equals that of the other two by the squeeze theorem (I've only seen the squeeze theorem proven for functions, but I believe it applies here since sequences are just functions with domains on the naturals). Therefore the sequence $\{a_n\}$ converges iff its $\lim \inf$ equals its $\lim \sup$ (and, as a corollary, the limit of the sequence always equals that of the infima and suprema). Please tell me if you see any holes or things I could've done better, as I've made many stupid mistakes in proofs before.

325836,Proof that all Cauchy sequences converge,"I am supposed to prove that all Cauchy sequences converge, using the fact that a sequence converges iff its lim sup equals its lim inf. I think the proof I have works, but the one given in the solutions is different, so I'd like to make sure. Also, this is for a calculus class, not real analysis, so I don't know about metric spaces or any of that. I believe the problem pertains solely to sequences in $\mathbb{R}$. We have the Cauchy sequence $\{a_n\}$. By the definition of the Cauchy sequence, we have
$$\left|a_m-a_n\right|<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
for a given $\epsilon>0$ and $m,n>N$. There exist the numbers $\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}$ and $\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}$, that is to say, the infimum and supremum of the sequence with the first $N$ terms truncated. By the definition of the infimum, we must have
$$\left| a_{low}-\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}\right|<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
for some $a_{low} \in \{a_n|n>N\}$, because otherwise $\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}+\frac{\epsilon}{3}$ would be a greater lower bound for $\{a_n|n>N\}$ than the infimum, a contradiction. By the same reasoning, we also have
$$\left|\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}-a_{high}\right|<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
for some $a_{high} \in \{a_n|n>N\}$. Now, by the definition of the Cauchy sequence, we must have
$$\left|a_{high}-a_{low}\right|<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
Expanding the absolute value terms gives
$$-\frac{\epsilon}{3}<a_{low}-\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
$$-\frac{\epsilon}{3}<\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}-a_{high}<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
$$-\frac{\epsilon}{3}<a_{high}-a_{low}<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
Adding these together gives
$$-\epsilon<\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}-\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}<\epsilon$$
So
$$\left|\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}-\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}\right|<\epsilon$$
which, we remember, holds for $n>N$. By the definition of the infinite limit, then, because we can make the difference of the infimum and the supremum arbitrarily close to zero by increasing $N$, we have
$$\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\left( \sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}-\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\} \right)=\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\sup_{n>N}\{a_n\}-\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\inf_{n>N}\{a_n\}=0$$

Then $f'(t) - g'(t)= (f-g)'(t) = 0$ and, by the definition of derivative (at $c\in I$): given $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that, if $0 < |x-c| < \delta$ then

It is not that mathematical, to be honest, it has lot of text and formulas sprinkled here and there. The part I am using (the book is about 550 pages) is simple enough, but I would like help understanding what mister Batty means when he writes thus: To demonstrate this, we define population in area $i$ at time $t$ as $P_i(t)$ /.../. (Means removed part of text) Then the change in population between any two time periods $t$ and $t+1$ is defined as $\Delta P_i(t) = P_i(t+1)-P_i(t)$ , with the rate as $\Delta P_i(t)/P_i(t)$ . We are now in a position to formalize the process of growth. First we state that the rate of growth is random: $$\frac{\Delta P_i(t)}{P_i(t)}=\varepsilon_i(t),$$ where $\varepsilon_i(t)$ is the random increment of growth associated with the area $i$ from time $t$ to $t+1$ . Using an appropriate form of the equation 8.8 [mentioned above] and integrating from the initial distribution $P_i(0)$ to the current $P_i(t)$ yields $$\log[P_i(t)]-\log[P_i(0)] = \sum_{\tau = 0}^t \varepsilon_i(\tau).$$ The model thus becomes $$P_i(t)=P_i(0) \prod_{\tau = 0}^t \varepsilon_i(\tau),$$ where the change from one time period to the next is $$P_i(t+1)=\varepsilon_i(t) P_i(t).$$ What baffles me are these lines: Using an appropriate form of the equation 8.8 [ $\frac{\Delta P_i(t)}{P_i(t)}=\varepsilon_i(t)$ ] and integrating from the initial distribution $P_i(0)$ to the current $P_i(t)$ yields $$\log[P_i(t)]-\log[P_i(0)] = \sum_{\tau = 0}^t \varepsilon_i(\tau).$$ The model thus becomes $$P_i(t)=P_i(0) \prod_{\tau = 0}^t \varepsilon_i(\tau),$$ where the change from one time period to the next is $$P_i(t+1)=\varepsilon_i(t) P_i(t).$$ What is the ""appropriate form""? What he means by ""integrating"" in this context? How do you get to the forms he mentions? And finally I, using simple algebra, came to the form of the model $P_i(t+1)=(1+\varepsilon_i(t)) P_i(t)$ , which is in conflict what the writer gets. Can anyone explain these to me?

326023,Accumulation Points of a Complex Sequence,"Let $z$ be a complex number of absolute value 1: $ z=e^{i\theta},  0 \le \theta \lt 2\pi$.  What are the accumulation points of the sequence $\lbrace z^n \rbrace$?  Distinguish between the case where $\theta$ is a rational multiple of $2\pi$ and the case when it is not.  Be sure to justify all of your assertions. So far I have the following: By DeMoivre's theorem, $z_n=\cos n\theta + i\sin n\theta$.
Also, $|z|=1$, so $z_n$ is on the unit circle for all $n$, and any value of $\theta$.  I suppose the thing that is tripping me up is the part about$\theta$ being a rational multiple of $2\pi$.  Is this the case when $\theta = 2\pi p/q$? If so, what difference does it make?","['complex-numbers', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

326049,How to solve $\int\cot^5x\sin^2x\ dx$?,"I'm not quite sure how to approach this without it getting extremely messy... and even then, I don't know if it will come out right. The best I can think of is to use IBP, but neither of those functions are easy to integrate. I did integrate $\sin^2x$ to get $$\int\sin^2x\ dx=\frac{2x+\sin{2x}}{4}+C$$ but I dare not try to go further as it looks like hell to apply IBP after this point. I did consider converting $\cot^5x$ to $\displaystyle\frac{\cos^5x}{\sin^5x}$, but then I wasn't any better off... $$\cot^5x\sin^2x=\frac{\cos^5x}{\sin^5x}\sin^2x=\cos^5x\csc^3x=\cos^2x\cot^3x$$","['trigonometry', 'calculus', 'integration']"

Assume that the fundamental group of $Y$ is finite and has order $d$. Then we want to show that $\chi (X)=d \chi(Y)$ where $\chi(\cdot)$ means Euler characteristic with respect to the sheaf of regular functions. Any ideas here? I guess it might be an easy application, but I don't see the connection between the chern class and the Todd class of $X$ and $Y$ in order to apply the Riemann Roch.",['algebraic-geometry']
326071,What does the notation $2\mathbb{Z}$ mean?,"I have an assignment that is asking to define a one-to-one correspondence between the sets $2\mathbb{Z}$ and $17\mathbb{Z}$... or in other words, define some bijective function on
$$f:2\mathbb{Z}\to 17\mathbb{Z}$$ Note: I know that $\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of integers.. I'm just wondering what the number in front means. Addendum: Given that I now know what these sets represent... is this a satisfactory answer for the question? A one-to-one correspondence between $2\mathbb{Z}$ and $17\mathbb{Z}$ could be as follows: \begin{align*}
  0&\mapsto 0\\
  2&\mapsto 17\\
  -2&\mapsto -17\\
  4&\mapsto 34\\
  -4&\mapsto -34\\
  6&\mapsto 51\\
  -6&\mapsto -51\\

And so on... In general, the function
\begin{equation*}
  f:2\mathbb{Z}\to 17\mathbb{Z}:2x\mapsto 17x,\forall x\in\mathbb{Z}

326082,Detecting the genus of a surface by walking straight ahead,"I have a - maybe misled - intuition that one could ""somehow"" detect that one lives on a torus (of genus 1) just by walking around straight ahead and making appropriate observations. Living on a ""true"" sphere, such a observation might be: all geodesics are closed and simple . There are deformations of the sphere where this still holds - but supposedly no other surfaces. So, if I observe that in whatever direction - and from whereever - I start walking straight ahead, I return to the starting point , I can conclude that I live on a (topological) sphere (of genus 0). Are there comparable observations I can make while walking around straight ahead

326090,Integration by Parts and Leibniz Rule for Differentiation under the Integral Sign,"Basically a friend of mine and I have had this hot debate for a little too long, I contend that these two tools are not only logically unconnected but they require different assumptions (I believe one requires a continuously differentiable function and another requires it to simply be continuous). We've even gone through the proofs and disagree on how the assumptions are used. I don't see the connection...  Maybe I'm wrong, maybe they are equivalent (you have one as a tool if and only if you have the other). Anyway, any fresh perspective would be welcomed and any deeper discussion on either appreciated, thanks.","['calculus', 'integration', 'derivatives', 'analysis']"
326105,$\sum_{i=1}^n i\cdot i! = (n+1)!-1$ By Induction,"I am trying to prove the following by Mathematical Induction: $$\sum_{i=1}^n i\cdot i! = (n+1)!-1\quad\text{for all integers $n\ge 1$}$$ My proof by Induction follows:
First prove $P(1)$ is true, $$\sum_{i=1}^1 i\cdot i! = (1+1)! - 1$$ Then, for all integers $k >= 1$, if $P(k)$ is true then $P(k+1)$ is also true, $$ \sum_{i=1}^k i\cdot i! = (k+1)! - 1$$
Then, we must show that $P(k+1)$ is true $$ \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i\cdot i! = ((k+1)+1)! - 1\\
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i\cdot i! = (k+2)! - 1$$ I am currently struggling with the next step to show that $P(k)$ is equal to $P(k+1)$. How would I finish this prove by induction?","['factorial', 'induction', 'summation', 'discrete-mathematics']"
