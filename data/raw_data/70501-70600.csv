859824,Closed form equation for win percentage of two battling armies,"I was pondering a battle mechanic for a board game that is similar to, but simpler than battling armies in Risk.  Consider one army of size X and a second army of size Y.  The battle occurs by creating pairs of one-on-one fights where the two combatants each have 50% probability of winning.  The pairs of fights continue until one army is defeated. For Example, a 2 vs 3 battle could have the following outcomes for the first army, when the first army wins: 1. W W W
2. L W W W
3. W L W W
4. W W L W Note that the final fight must be a win, all outcomes must have 3 wins total (the size of the second army, Y), and there cannot be more than 1 loss (the size of the first army, X, minus 1). I'm having trouble finding a closed form equation that gives the probability of the first army winning the battle where the sizes of the armies are X and Y. If that's easy, how about if the probability of winning the battle if an individual fight is not 50% but rather probability P? Edit: just wanted to add a 3 vs 2 example as well: 1. W W
2. L W W
3. W L W
4. L L W W
5. L W L W
6. W L L W Here's the 2 vs 2 case, which produces a 50% probability: 1. W W
2. L W W
3. W L W","['statistics', 'probability']"

859832,Jaynes' taxicab problem,"I am currently reading Jaynes' Probability Theory, The Logic of Science and am still trying to absorb everything. On page 190, he poses the following intriguing question, paraphrased here. Suppose you fell asleep on the train and upon waking up, you arrive at an unknown station. All you can see is a taxicab with the number 27. What is then your guess at the number N of taxis in the town (assuming they are numbered from 1 consecutively). The ""straightforward"" answer would be 27. I came up with my own solution, see below, and I wonder whether it is a correct way of thinking about the problem. 
Also, since I am lacking formal training, I am interested in a more systematic analysis. In particular I'd like to have someone sketch the ""true Bayesian"" solution to this, with  all the quantities explicitly stated and not glossed over. Thank you. My thinking is as follows.
Suppose the probability of encountering any taxi is 1/N. Then the probability of seeing a taxicab  with number at most x is x/N. So, seeing taxicab 27, the number N is at least 27 with probability 1. Continuing, 27 is with 90% probability from the 0-0.9 quantile, from which I think I can conclude that N>=30 with 90% probability. Likewise, I'd say that N>=54 with 50% probability, etc.","['bayesian', 'probability']"

859883,Closed form for sequence A145271,"I would like to know if there is a simple formula or method
of expanding the expression given by $\left[g(x) \frac{d}{dx}\right]^n g(x)$ where $n$ is a positive integer, without having to resort to
actually carrying out the differentiation. The aim is like
that of expanding $(x + y)^n$. For this one, there is a simple 
formula (goes like combination $n$ take $r$) to obtain each 
numerical coefficient and each term in the expansion can simply 
be written without the need to actually carry out the 
multiplication. One can likewise simply use Pascal's triangle. Attempt at solution Ignoring the numerical coefficients, one can simply expand the
expression above using Ferrer's diagram. Take for instance, 
$n = 4$. The corresponding set of Ferrer's diagrams is $
\begin{align*}
\begin{array}[t]{l}
\bigcirc\\
\bigcirc\\
\bigcirc\\
\bigcirc
\end{array}
\qquad
\begin{array}[t]{ll}

\end{array}
\qquad
\begin{array}[t]{llll}
\bigcirc & \bigcirc &\bigcirc&\bigcirc
\end{array}
\end{align*}
$ The number of columns of each Ferrer's diagram corresponds 
to the number of $g$ (or its derivatives) factors plus one
for each term in the expansion. Thus, the expansion for $n = 4$
takes the form $\left[g(x) \frac{d}{dx} \right]^{n=4}g(x)
:
( )( ) + ( )( )( ) + ( )( )( ) + ( )( )( )( ) + ( )( )( )( )( )
$ The length of each column for a given Ferrer's diagram 
corresponds to the order of derivatives. We can then improve the
schematic relation above as $
\begin{align*}
\left[g(x) \frac{d}{dx}\right]^{n=4}g(x)
&:
(g'''')( ) + (g''')(g' )( ) + (g'')(g'')( ) + (g'')(g')(g')( ) + (g')(g')(g')(g')( )
\\
&=
g''''() + g'''g'() + g''^2() + g''g'^2() + g'^4()
\end{align*}
$ The remaining factor to fill in () is $g$ to a certain power. For each term, the exponent is simply the sum of orders of derivative of each factor minus the number of factors with derivatives plus 1. For instance, for $g'''g'( )$, the sum of the orders of derivatives is 4 (just count the number of primes) and the number of factors with derivatives is 2. As such, $g'''g'() = g'''g'g^{4 - 2 + 1} = g'''g'g^3$. Similarly, $g''g'^2( ) = g''g'^2g^{4 - 3 + 1} = g''g'^2g^2$ One can then simply write down (ignoring the numerical coefficients) the expansion as $
\begin{align*}
\left[g(x) \frac{d}{dx} \right]^{n=4}g(x)
&:
g''''g^4 + g'''g'g^3 + g''^2g^3 + g''g'^2g^2 + g'^4g
\end{align*}
$ The problem now is the coefficient of each term in the
expansion. The sequence of coefficients is actually 
sequence number A145271 (OEIS) . For $n = 4$, this sequence
is simply $\{1, 7, 4, 11, 1\}$ so that $
\begin{align*}
\left[g(x) \frac{d}{dx} \right]^{n=4}g(x)
&=
g''''g^4 + 7g'''g'g^3 + 4g''^2g^3 + 11g''g'^2g^2 + g'^4g
\end{align*}
$ but I cannot find a simple procedure to reproduce this sequence 
without actually expanding the original expression above through
differentiation; hence, this post. Any diagrammatic method,
closed form expression, or a null statement (eg., such a
closed form expression does not exist) would be greatly
appreciated. [Note: I am not a mathematician and is not very familiar

859884,Shape operator and orthogonality of eigenvectors,"When studying differential geometry (at a hobby level) I always run into problems when it comes to the varying notations and statements about the shape operator $S_p(\mathbf{x})=I^{-1}_pII_p(\mathbf{x})$. 
More specifically, my problems have to do with the orthogonality of the eigenvectors of $S_p$. The cause of some problems might relate to uncertainty ""where"" (in which coordinate space) stuff is happening, so first of all, considering a surface $X:\Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$, am I right in thinking that the parameters $\mathbf{x}$ in $S_p(\mathbf{x})$ are ""from"" the parameter domain, that is $\mathbf{x}\in\Omega$? Now, let $\mathbf{u}_1$ and $\mathbf{u}_2$ be the two eigenvectors with $S_p\mathbf{u}_i=k_i\mathbf{u}_i$.
Many authors state: ""The eigenvectors of $S_p$ are called principal directions. ...  Recall that it also follows from the Spectral Theorem that the principal directions are orthogonal..."" How can this be? As noted above, in my opinion $S_p$ is ""evaluated"" on $\Omega$. The $S_p$-Matrix is not symmetric. And hence (according to maple) $<\mathbf{u}_1,\mathbf{u}_2>\neq0$. However, it seems that when speaking about orthogonality of the eigenvectors it is always implied that they are first transferred via the Jacobian $J_X$ to the tangent plane: $<J_X\mathbf{u}_1,J_X\mathbf{u}_2>=<\mathbf{u}_1,\mathbf{u}_2>_I=0$.
So, my intuition seems to be wrong, can someone point me in the right direction? Finally, I believe prove orthogonality $<\mathbf{u}_1,\mathbf{u}_2>_I=0$ should be easy using simple substitutions, but I seem to be missing some linear algebraic argument... any idea?
\begin{equation}
<\mathbf{u}_1,\mathbf{u}_2>_I = \mathbf{u}_1^T I_p \mathbf{u}_2 = \\
\textit{using } S_p\mathbf{u}_2=I^{-1}_pII_p\mathbf{u}_2=k_2\mathbf{u}_2 \textit{ we get }\\
\frac{1}{k_2}\mathbf{u}_1^T I_p I^{-1}_pII_p\mathbf{u}_2=\frac{1}{k_2}\mathbf{u}_1^T II_p\mathbf{u}_2\\

It says there on page 28: Let $\alpha,\beta$ be two oriented, transverse, simple closed curves on an oriented surface $S$. The algebraic intersection number $\hat{i}(\alpha,\beta)$ is defined as the sum of the indeces of the intersection points of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, where an index of an intersection point is $+1$ if the orientation of the intersection agrees with the orientation of $S$ and $-1$ otherwise. First of all, I can't really make sense of the notion of agreement of the orientation of an intersection with the orientation of the surface. What I could imagine is choosing one of the curves ($\alpha$) as a reference and counting an intersetion with $+1$ if the other curve ($\beta$) crosses $\alpha$ from left to right and with $-1$ if $\beta$ crosses $\alpha$ from right to left. In Farb and Margalit's book it is mentioned that this intersection number is invariant for homologically equivalent loops.

I need the solution for periodic boundary conditions from -1 to 1, but I'll be fine if you direct me for any sort of boundary conditions.. I've realised that I can solve this for some types of boundary conditions. What i'd be really interested in is how to do this for periodic boundary conditions... Technically, if I approach the problem by splitting the regions $x<0$ and $x>0$ and solve in each part separately, I can solve it and get linear equations in both regions. This will give me $4$ variables. Periodicity, and periodicity of the derivative will give me 2 equations. Continuity at $x=0$ will give me one more. How do i relate the derivative around the $x=0$ interface? A little background: If there was no delta function, but rather say some gaussian approximation, I would be expect to be able to solve it, but I don't see why I can't get the information of the derivative around $x=0$ when i put in a dirac delta function. My actual problem is reasonably more complicated but this is the quickest simple example I could reduce my problem to. If I try to integrate in an epsilon region around $0$, then I end up with an expression in $y^\prime(0)$, which isn't defined. If it helps, i'm actually interested in a physical problem, so this delta function is just an approximation, but i'm unable to take any function in it's place whose limit I can make tend to a delta function.. Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated! EDIT: I guess I should make my actual problem a bit clearer as well. In this simplistic case i can simplify the differential equation by means of the substitution of $z=y^\prime$, however I can't really do that in my original equation.

860071,Why isn't the volume formula for a cone $\pi r^2h$?,"So I understand that the volume formula of a cone is: $\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h$, and when I read about how to derive this formula, it makes sense to me.  Funny thing is, I'm stuck on why it ISN'T $\pi r^2h$ when I think about deriving the volume formula in a different way. Here's what I mean.  Now we're told that to figure out the volume formula for something like a cylinder or cube, we simply multiply the area of the base by the height, and this makes intuitive sense.  In the case of a cone, what if we took a triangle with base r and height h, and rotated it around some axis, producing a cone.  When I think of it this way, it seems reasonable (in my mind) to calculate the volume of the produced cone by taking the area of the triangle, and multiplying it by the circumference of the circle that is the cone's base.  So if the area of our triangle is: $\frac12rh$ and the circumference of the generated cone's circle-base is: $2\pi r$, then the volume should be: $\pi r^2h$.  This derivation seems intuitively correct to me. Now I know it isn't correct, and I almost feel silly asking, but I just can't see WHY it's not correct.

$$ Here $y$ is a real-valued, monotonically increasing, positive definite function of $t$ in the interval $(0,\infty)$ and is bounded on every closed interval in $(0,\infty)$; $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are constants. After a few manipulations, one arrives at this expression: $$
\int_{x_0}^{x(t)}{\frac{1}{{x^n}\sqrt{x+1}} dx} = \beta t
$$ for some $\beta$. For integer $n>1$ the integral can also be performed: $$
2^{1-2n} {2(n-1) \choose n-1}

b_{n,k}=\frac{{2(n-1) \choose 2k}{2(n-1-k) \choose n-1-k}}{2^{2(n-1-k)}{n-1 \choose k}^2}
=
\frac{\Gamma (n - \frac12) \Gamma (k+1)}{\Gamma (n) \Gamma (k + \frac12)}
$$ I am not certain how to extend this result to non-integer values of $n$ without the use of special functions, e.g. the Beta function, which is suggested by the integral. In any case, the next step in the calculation would be to take the inverse of the LHS - but I have no idea how to do that. However, the form of the sum seems very suggestive; perhaps at the limit of large $n$, $\sqrt{x+1}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}{(-1)^{-k}b_{n,k}k^{-1}x^{-k}}$ may be approximated by a constant and for low $n$ by some other function, which will enable further calculations. The following also seems to hold: $$
\sqrt{x+1} \sum^{n-1}_{k=1}{(-1)^{-k}\frac{\Gamma(n-\frac12)(k-1)!}{\Gamma(k+\frac12)}x^{-k}} = 
(-1)^n \frac{2\sqrt{x+1}}{(2n-1)x^{n}}

-\frac{2 \Gamma(n-\frac12)}{\sqrt{\pi} \Gamma(n)}
\mathrm{sinh}^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \right)
$$ although I am uncertain to what degree that may lead to an invertible expression for the integral without the use of more ""exotic"" special functions; after all the hypergeometric function in this expression appears to be the dominant term. I found that the late-time behaviour may be approximated by the $\int{dx \frac{1}{x^n}}$; however such an approximation misses the early-time behaviour and does not approach the correct asymptote by simply applying the original initial condition. It would still be very helpful if there exist special exact or approximate formulae for the inverse of the incomplete Beta function, e.g. for special parameter values (the case $n=1$ is already derived here).","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'special-functions', 'calculus', 'inverse', 'summation']"

I tried to follow the hint to consider the element $(1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},...,\frac{1}{n},...)$ but failed. To user26857: I want a proof of the existence or nonexistence of isomorphism between these two vector spaces. If I get it right, your solution reduced the problem to the existence of basis of these two vector spaces. And in your sense, a basis  is a subset $B$ (of the vector space $V$) such that every finite subset of $B$ is a linearly independent set and any vector in $V$ can be expressed as a finite sum of the elements in $B$. If this is what you mean, can you show the existence of such basis? Thank you! To Ragib Zaman: Your example is a better one. Thanks!","['vector-spaces', 'commutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"
860089,Set with relative complement forms partition,"Prove that if $S$ is a set and  $ \emptyset \subsetneq A  \subsetneq S $ then $\Pi = \{A ,  S-A \}$ is a partition of $S$.

Since $S-A  \subset S $ and $A \subset S$ we have that $A \cup  (S -A) \subset S $ Let  $ x  \in S$ Then, by the law of excluded middle, either $x \in A$ or $x \notin A$ If $x \notin A $ then $ x \in (S-A) $ So therefore we have: $x \in A \lor x  \in (S-A)   $ $ \iff  x \in A \cup  (S-A)$ Hence $ S \subset  A \cup (S-A) $ and so $ A \cup (S-A) = S $ Finally: $A \cap (S - A) $ $ =(A  \cap S ) - (A  \cap A)$ $= (A \cap S) - A$ $= ( A -A)  \cap (S - A)$ $= \emptyset $ Therefore $\Pi = \{ A , S- A\} $ satisfies all the conditions needed to be a partition $$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$ I can't help but feel this is a really disjointed proof, and is not as concise as it can be.

Now, I want to show that if $G$ has no subgroup of index $2$, then this product is in fact in $M$, which would allow me to conclude that one of the factors is in $M$, since $x$ fixes an odd number of cosets and thus the product has an odd number of terms. But I'm not sure how to show this. I know that if $G$ doesn't have an index $2$ subgroup, then all the permutations of its left regular representation are even. Since in the LRR, an element of order $m$ will consist of $\dfrac{n}{m}$ $m$-cycles, all the permutations being even implies that there is no element of order $2^k$, which means that $T$ is not cyclic.

618669248999119/196928538206400 - Pi. This question relates to my answer given in Is there an integral that proves $\pi > 333/106$? Update#1: Recently Thomas Baruchel (see his answer below) has conducted extensive calculations and found that four parameters formula yields infinite number of solutions for each $n$ . Thomas shared with me his calculations results and supplied me with quite a few of valid combinations of $i, j, k, l$ values - so now I have a lot of experimentally found five-tuples $\{ n,i, j, k, l\}$ , which satisfy above parametrization, where $n$ varies in the range from 2 to 26. Looking at all available {i,j,k,l} solutions (initial ones found by me and those which were found by Thomas Baruchel program) one could observe that in all of them abs(l-j)=2*m where ""m"" is some positive integer. Based on this data, of course, it would be nice to find how (if at all) $i, j, k, l$ are inter-related between each other and with "" $n$ "" - but such inter-relation (if exists) is not obvious and difficult to derive just by observation ... (though it is clearly seen that an absolute value of "" $i$ "" is strongly increasing as "" $n$ "" is growing from 2 to 26). Update #2: Thanks to Jaume Oliver Lafont, at least one case, answering affirmatively to the last question, is identified: i=-1, j=-2, k=1, l=0 $$\pi = \int_{0}^{1}\frac{4}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x$$ Should there be an infinite number of such cases? David Trimas looked into the option involving partial solution for my conjecture by setting j=l=0 and deriving formulas for ""i"" and ""k"" for j=l=0 condition. The result is following: (-1) ^ n * (Pi − A002485(n)/A002486(n)) = ((Abs(i)) * 2 ^ j) ^ (-1) * Int((x ^ l * (1 - x) ^ (2 * (j + 2)) * (k + (i + k) * x ^ 2 ))/(1 + x ^ 2 ), x=0 ...1) holds true for any n>2 and j=l=0 when i =(-1)^(n) * 3 * A002486(n) k = (-1)^(n) * (47 * A002486(n) - 15 * A002485(n) For example for n=3 where A002485(3)=22 and A002486(3)=7 i=(-1)^3 3 7=-21 k=(-1)^3*(47 7 - 15 22)=1 and the quick check via Inverse Symbolic Calculator using Maple (also could be done using Mathematica) provides the confirmation. i:=-21;j:=0;k:=1;l:=0;(abs(i) 2^j)^(-1) int((x^l (1-x)^(2 (j+2))*(k+(i+k)*x^2))/(1+x^2),x=0...1) = 22/7 - Pi Substitution of i =(-1)^(n) * 3 * A002486(n) and k = (-1)^(n) * (47 * A002486(n) - 15 * A002485(n) into general conjectured formula with the condition that j=l=0 (under which above formulas for ""i"" and ""k"" were derived) confirmed those formulas for ""i"" and ""k"" validity by bringing lhs and rhs to be equal. Though above finding is obviously circular in nature (it doesn't reveal direct dependency of ""i"" and and ""k"" on ""n"" but rather does it via A002485(n) and A002486(n) ) - it is in my view a step forward. As I mentioned above, observation of all obtained solutions for my conjectured identity (which represents generalization of Stephen Lucas' experimentally obtained identities between Pi and its convergents) shows that abs(l-j)=2*m
where ""m"" is some positive integer.
Going further I make another conjecture re identity which relates Log(2) and its convergents and is analogous to the one which relates Pi and its convergents. Below is conjectured by me formula (expressed in Maple notations) for relating Log(2) (that is Ln(2)) with ALL of its convergents - those, which are described via A079942(n)/A079943(n) ratio where A079942(n) and A079943(n) are OEIS integer sequences.

The problem is the following: (I'm using the definitions by Guillemin & Pollack) Let $Y\subset R^N$ be an $l-$dimensional manifold and suppose $X$ is a $k-$dimensional submanifold of $Y$. Let $\imath:X\rightarrow Y$ be the inclusion map. Then for every $x\in X$, the differential $d\imath_x:T_xX\rightarrow T_xY$ is also the inclusion map. This is my solution: Let's take $x\in X$. Consider a parametrization $\phi:U\subset R^l\rightarrow V$ of $Y$ around $x$ such that $0\in U$ and $\phi(0)=x$. Since the definitions don't depend on the parametrizations we can consider the following parametrization of $X$ around $x$: We know that there exists an open set $\mathcal V$ in $R^N$ such that $V=\mathcal V\cap Y$, so we can consider the open set $\tilde V=\mathcal V\cap X$ in $X$. Define $\tilde\phi:\tilde U\subset R^k\rightarrow\tilde V$ as $$\tilde\phi(a_1,\dots,a_k)=\phi(a_1,\dots,a_k,0,\dots,0),$$ where $\tilde U$ is the inverse image of $U$ under the canonical inclusion $\jmath:R^k\hookrightarrow R^l$. Clearly, $\tilde\phi$ is smooth, because $\tilde\phi=\phi\circ\jmath$. Moreover, $\tilde\phi$ is a diffeomorphism with inverse $\tilde\phi^{-1}=\pi\circ\phi\vert_{\tilde V}^{-1}$, where $\pi:R^k\times R^{l-k}\rightarrow R^k$ is the projection on $R^k$. Now, let $v\in T_xX$, then $v=d\tilde\phi_0(a)$ with $a\in R^k$. Observe that $v=d\phi_0(\jmath(a))$. Then $$d\imath_x(v)=d\phi_0\circ d\tilde\imath_0\circ(d\tilde\phi_0)^{-1}(v),$$ where $\tilde\imath=\phi^{-1}\circ\imath\circ\tilde\phi=\jmath\vert_{\tilde U}$. Since $d\tilde\imath_0=\jmath$, then we have $$d\imath_x(v)=d\phi_0\circ d\tilde\imath_0\circ(d\tilde\phi_0)^{-1}(v)=d\phi_0(\jmath(a))=v.$$ So, $d\imath_x$ is the inclusion map.","['differential-topology', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

My approach for these kind of problems used to be creating a function that just maps from the first set to the second, making permutations as necessary. But infinity is confusing me. So this is my approach so far: Index each set with different index numbers, both natural numbers. $x$ for naturals, and $y$ for elements in $A$.

How to prove formally that $C(\mathbb{R}) \notin \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}})$ (the product sigma algebra)?

861038,Let $\mathbb Q\le K$ finite extension of fields $\alpha\in K$. Then $N(\alpha)=\pm1\Leftrightarrow\alpha$ is a unit,"Let $\mathbb Q\le K$ (where $K\le\mathbb C$) be a finite extension (say $|K:\mathbb Q|=n$) of fields and let  $\alpha\in K$ be an algebraic integer, i.e. $\alpha$ is a root of a monic polynomial over $\mathbb Z$; let's call $\mathbb A$ the set (which in fact is a ring) of the algebraic integers of $\mathbb C$. Hence we picked $\alpha\in\mathbb A\cap K$. We know that there exists $\beta\in K$ s.t. $K=\mathbb Q(\beta)$. Call $f\in\mathbb Q[X]$ the minimal polynomial of $\beta$ over $\mathbb Q$, clearly $\partial f=n$ and it has $n$ different roots (in some extension of $K$ or in $K$ itself if we suppose it normal over $\mathbb Q$). Then there are exactly $n$ embeddings of $K$ in $\mathbb C$ (an embedding is an immersion $K=\mathbb Q(\beta)\hookrightarrow\mathbb C$ s.t. $q\mapsto q\;\;\forall q\in\mathbb Q$ and $\beta$ goes to one of the $n$ roots of $f$; clearly if $K$ is normal then the embeddings are automorphisms of $K$); call them $\sigma_i,\;i=1,\dots,n$. So we can now define a norm on $K$: $N(\alpha):=\sigma_1(\alpha)\cdots\sigma_n(\alpha)\;\;\forall \alpha\in K$. So we can now face the ""problem"" (I know it must be almost silly but I can't get find a way out!): given $\alpha\in\mathbb A\cap K$, prove that
$$
N(\alpha)=\pm1\Longleftrightarrow\alpha\;\; \mbox{is a unit in}\;\; \mathbb A\cap K\;.
$$
I solved $\Leftarrow\;$: by hypotesis there exists $\alpha^{-1}\in\mathbb A\cap K$; then
$$
\alpha\alpha^{-1}=1\Longrightarrow\;1=N(1)=N(\alpha\alpha^{-1})=N(\alpha)\left(N(\alpha)\right)^{-1}.
$$
Observe now that $\alpha\in\mathbb A$ hence in particular it's a root of a polynomial over $\mathbb Z$. Among such polynomials, taking the one of lower degree, we can see it must be irreducible. This is the minimal polinomial of $\alpha$. Hence $N(\alpha)$ will be the constant term of this polynomial, so $N(\alpha)\in\mathbb Z$. Hence $N(\alpha)=\pm1$. But how can I prove the other implication?

861044,Holomorphic line bundle with degree zero,"I'm studying algebraic geometry and I need some help to understand the Riemann-Roch theorem.
Let us consider a holomorphic line bundle $\xi$ over a Riemann surface $X$. The unique invariant of a holomorphic bundle is the equivalence class $[D]$ of the divisor $D$ of an arbitrary section, but it looks like this class is ""complicated to calculate"". The most simplest invariant of line bundles is the degree $\text{deg}\,D$ of divisor $D$. In fact, it is just the Euler characteristic. This number is enough to classify all line bundles over $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$. The second clear invariant is the count of linearly independent holomorphic sections. 
This number is precisely $l(-D)$. According to the Riemann-Roch theorem we have the formula
$$
l(D) - l'(D) = 1 - g - \text{deg}\,D,
$$
that we can use to calculate the $l(D)$. Am I understanding this theorem correctly? Ok. Could you show me some example of a non-trivial holomorphic line bundle over torus that has degree zero. Thanks.","['riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry']"

861058,How to Prove this Multinomial Distribution Inequality,"I have the following lemma, but there seems to be one (or two) mistakes in the proof found in this paper (lemma 3).
The lemma states that for $Multinomial(n,p_1,\ldots,p_k)$ distributed $(X_1,\ldots,X_k)$ the following inequality holds: $P(\sum|X_i-np_i|\geq \epsilon) \leq 3\exp(-n\epsilon^2/25)$ However, in the proof he defines some new Variables, especially a $Poisson(n)$ variable N, independent from iid $U_1,U_2,\ldots$ with $P(U_1=i)=p_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,k$. He then defines $X_1',\ldots,X_k'$ with $X_i'$ being the number of occurences of $i$ in $U_1,\ldots,U_N$, that is $X_i'=\sum_{j=1}^N 1_{U_j=i}$. Of course they are each $Poisson(np_i)$ distributed, but then he states, that they are independent as well, but that cannot be, can it? For example, take $k=2$, then $X_1'=N-X_2'$. Sadly he uses this independence like 10 lines later. My question is - am I missing something obvious?

Frattini subgroup characterization,"This question is the last leg of an exercise I've been working on in which we characterize the intersection of all maximal subgroups as the subgroup of all non-generators. I've already shown that if a group has a maximal subgroup then the intersection of all the maximal subgroups are precisely the non-generators. Also, I've shown that if every element of a group is a non-generator, then the group has no maximal subgroups. But I'm having difficulty with this claim: If a group has no maximal subgroups, then all elements are non-generators. All the proofs I've seen of this characterization assume that there are maximal subgroups, so I'm not even sure if the claim is true. Any help is appreciated. ADDENDUM Per request, here's my proof for the other three cases (none of which use Zorn's lemma): Let $G$ be a group. Let's denote the intersection of all maximal subgroups of $G$ by $\Phi(G)$ . If $G$ has no maximal subgroups, we set $\Phi(G)=G$ . Let's denote the subgroup of all non-generators of $G$ by $N(G)$ . We note that if $G$ is trivial, then $\Phi(G)=N(G)$ . So we can forget about that case. Case 1: $G$ has a maximal subgroup. Let $g\in\Phi(G)$ . Now let $X\subseteq G$ satisfy $\langle X, g\rangle=G$ . Let $M$ be a maximal subgroup of $G$ . Then we have that $M\subseteq\langle X, g\rangle=G$ . Also, since $g\in\Phi(G)\subseteq M$ , we have that $M\subseteq\langle X\rangle\subseteq G$ . Thus $\langle X\rangle=M$ or $\langle X\rangle=G$ by maximality of $M$ . Suppose $\langle X\rangle=M$ . This would imply that $\langle X, g\rangle=M$ contradicting the assumption. Thus $\langle X\rangle=G$ , and $g$ is a nongenerator. Thus $\Phi(G)\subseteq N(G)$ . Now let $g\in N(G)$ . Let $M$ be an arbitrary maximal subgroup of $G$ . Suppose $g$ were not in $M$ . Then by maximality of $M$ , $\langle M,g\rangle=G$ . However, since $g$ is a nongenerator, this implies that $\langle M\rangle = M=G$ . Contradiction. Thus $g\in M$ . Since $M$ was arbitrary, $g\in\Phi(G)$ . Case 2: $G$ has no maximal subgroup. We have that $\Phi(G)=G$ . Thus we trivially have that $N(G)\subseteq\Phi(G)$ . We are left to prove that $\Phi(G)=G\subseteq N(G)$ which was the reason behind the question.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
