57490,How to deduce that there are $(n^3+2n-3)/3$ multiplications for the determinant evaluation?,"In Friedberg's Linear Algebra, the author points out that the evaluation of the determinant of an $n\times n$ matrix by cofactor expansion along any row requires over $n!$ multiplications, whereas evaluating the determinant of an $n\times n$ matrix by elementary row operations can be shown to require only $(n^3+2n-3)/3$ multiplications. I cannot even figure out the case when $n=2$. The key point, I think, is the exact algorithm of evaluating by elementary row operations. But I temporarily have no idea how to go on. Here is my question: How can I deduce the number $(n^3+2n-3)/3$?","['linear-algebra', 'determinant']"

57528,Automorphism on a finite dimensional vector space,"If $V$ is a vector space over $\mathbb Q$ with $\operatorname{dim}(V)=3$. How we can prove that there is NO automorphism $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ such that $\phi^{-1}=2\phi$. I tried: Let $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ is an automorphism such that $\phi^{-1}=2\phi$, then let $v,u\in V$, then since $\phi^{-1}$ is also a homomorphism we have: $$\phi^{-1}(uv)=\phi^{-1}(u)\phi^{-1}(v)=2\phi(u).2\phi(v)=4\phi(u)\phi(v)$$
 On the other hand, $\phi^{-1}(uv)=2\phi(uv)=2\phi(u)\phi(v)$, so $$4\phi(u)\phi(v)=2\phi(u)\phi(v)$$ implies $\phi(u)\phi(v)=0$, for all $u,v \in V$, which means $\phi=0$. I think there is something missing in my argument! I didn't need the dimension of $V$ !! Any suggestion!?",['linear-algebra']

  differential forms cannot be integrated over subsets of the manifold;
  this distinction is key to the distinction between differential forms,
  which are integrated over chains, and measures, which are integrated
  over subsets. Isn't a chain a manifold, and therefore a subset of a manifold? Why
is that ""differential forms cannot be integrated over subsets of the

integral via parameterization of the chain, as like here $$\int_S \omega =\int_D \sum a_{i_1,\dots,i_k}(S({\mathbf u})) \frac{\partial(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_k})}{\partial(u^{1},\dots,u^{k})}\,du^1\ldots du^k $$ So can one say that

57617,Smash product on the stable homotopy category of spectra,"One can not define a symmetric monoidal smash product for ordinary spectra because of the twist isomorphism wanting to be involved. But still, the stable homotopy category (viewed as the homotopy category of the stable model structure on spectra) can be equipped with a symmetric monoidal smash product, I've read. My first question is: Can I define this smash product on the homotopy category of the stable model structure on spectra by setting
$$
(X\wedge Y)_n=\bigvee_{p+q=n} X_p\wedge Y_q
$$
with structure maps induced by (only) the structure maps of $Y$ defined by a coequalizer
$$
\bigvee_{p+q=n-1} X_p\wedge Y_q \wedge S^1\stackrel{\to}{\to} \bigvee_{p+q=n} X_p\wedge Y_q
$$
where one map uses the structure map of $X$ and the other one switches the factors and uses the structure map of $X$.
If yes, what is the reason that this defines a monoidal operation on the homotopy category? Probably this is a consequence of the fact (?) that applying the twist $\tau$ is homotopic to the the identity but I neither see why this should be true nor how it implies the existence of the smash product. There are two ways to extend the functor $-\wedge S^1$ on spaces to spectra, e.g. one by setting $(X\wedge S^1)_n=X_n\wedge S^1$ and structure maps
$$
X_n\wedge S^1\wedge S^1\xrightarrow{id\wedge\tau}X_n\wedge S^1\wedge S^1\to X_{n+1}\wedge S^1.
$$
The other one does not involve the twist.These functors should correspond on the stable homotopy category to smashing with the sphere spectrum $S$. But evaluating $X\wedge S$ with the smash product (if it actually is the right definition) defined above gives $(X_0\wedge S^0)$, $(X_1\wedge S^0\vee X_0\wedge S^1)$, $\ldots$ which doesn't look right. My second question is: What am I missing here?","['general-topology', 'homotopy-theory', 'algebraic-topology']"
57624,How many rolls do I need to determine if my dice are fair?,"Roughly how many times do I need to roll a 6-sided die to feel confident that it's giving ""fair"" results?

I'd like to minimize how long it takes me to perform this experiment with each die :) I know this depends on my expected ""confidence level"" (95%? 99%?)

I'm trying to find changes of variable that leave this distribution invariant.

Moreover the transformation should be a bijection and $h$ should be continuous. Then I say that the binomial distribution is invariant with this change of variables if $$\binom{n}{r}\theta^r(1-\theta)^{n-r}=\binom{m}{s}\psi^s(1-\psi)^{m-s}$$ An example would be the following change of variables $$\begin{align*}m&=n\\

57749,Whence this generalization of linear (in)dependence?,"I recently came across a definition of (in)dependence that is supposed to be a generalization of linear (in)dependence among a set of vectors: An element $x$ is dependent on a set of elements $\{a_1, \cdots, a_n\}$ iff any two real-valued additive functions that take equal values on each of the elements $a_1, \cdots, a_n$ also agree on $x$.  A set of elements $\{a_1,\cdots,a_n\}$ is independent iff no member of the set is dependent on the rest. The term ""additive function"" used in this definition describes a (real-valued) function $f$ such that $f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)\;\; \forall a, b \in \mathrm{dom}(f)$.  Of course, this presupposes that some form of addition is defined in the domain of such $f$.  It is safe to assume that this domain is an Abelian group, but you may assume additional structure if this is necessary to answer my question. I find this definition of dependence much harder to think about and work with than the standard definition of linear dependence for vectors, so I wonder what's the justification for such a counterintuitive definition. Is anyone familiar with this way of defining dependence/independence?  If so, what algebraic structure is it used for?","['modules', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups']"

57754,No group of order 36 is simple,"Fraleigh(7ed) Example37.14 No group of order 36 is simple. Such a group $G$ has either $1$ or $4$ subgroups of order $9$. If there is only one such subgroup, it is normal in $G$. If there are four such subgroups, let $H$ and $K$ be two of them. $H \cap K$ must have at least $3$ elements, or $HK$ would have to have $81$ elements, from $|HK|=|H||K|/|H\cap K|$. Thus the normalizer of $H \cap K$ has as order a multiple of $>1$ of $9$ and a divisor of $36$; hence the order must be either $18$ or $36$. If the order is $18$, the normalizer is then of index $2$ and therefore is normal in $G$. If the order is $36$, then $ H \cap K$ is normal in $G$. I don't understand the highlighted sentence. It must be from that $N(H \cap K) \supset H$ (or $K$), but why $H\cap K$ is normal in $H$ or $K$? I guess it must be from the first Sylow thoerem(below). But the first Sylow theorem seems to state that $H\cap K$ is a normal subgroup of a subgroup of order $9$ , not necessariliy $H$ or $K$, maybe other than $H$ and $K$. How can I conclude that $H \cap K$ is a normal subgroup of $H$ or $K$? First Sylow Theorem Let $G$ be a finite group and let $|G|=p^n m$ where $n\ge1$ and where $p$ does not divide $m$. Then 1. $G$ contains a subgroup of order $p^i$ for each $i$ where $1 \le i \le n$ 2. every subgroup $H$ of $G$ of order $p^i$ is a normal subgroup of a subgroup of order $p^{i+1}$ for $1\le i<n$ Edit: It was very easy. By the first Sylow theorem, $H \cap K$ is a normal subgroup of a subgroup of order $9$, not necessarily $H$ or $K$. But it is still true that $N(H \cap K)$ contains a subgroup of order $9$, so $N(H\cap K)$ has as order a multiple of $9$.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

57859,Generalizing Lagrange multipliers to use the subdifferential,"Background: This is a followup to the question Lagrange multipliers with non-smooth constraints . Lagrange multipliers can be used for constrained optimization problems of the form $$\min_{\vec x} f(\vec x) \text{ such that } g(\vec x) = 0$$ Briefly, the method works by constructing the Lagrangian, $L(\vec x, \lambda) = f(\vec x) + \lambda g(\vec x)$ , then finding points where $\forall i, \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i} L = 0$ and $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} L = 0$ . As was kindly pointed out in this answer , the method fails when $g$ is non-differentiable (but continuous), because the partial derivatives may not exist at points of optimality.  For example, in the problem, minimize $x_1$ subject to $g(x_1,x_2) = x_1 - |x_2| = 0$ . The minimum is at $(0,0)$ , where $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_2}$ does not exist. Question: It seems that there should be a natural generalization of the method that uses subgradients and the subdifferential.  Does the following work?  Is there a reference that describes this in more detail? Proposal: construct the Lagrangian as usual, but instead of seeking a point where all partial derivatives are 0, seek a point where 0 is in each partial subdifferential.  So in the example above, the subdifferential with respect to $x_2$ when $x_2=0$ is the interval $[-\lambda, \lambda]$ .  Thus, if we were given the solution $x_1=0,x_2=0,\lambda=-1$ , we could verify it is a critical point by noting that $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = x_1 - |x_2| = 0$ , $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_1} = 1 + \lambda = 0$ , and 0 is in the subdifferential of $L$ w.r.t. $x_2$ . Is this argument correct?  My intuitive justification is that for any value $f'(x)$ in some variable's subdifferential at $x$ , we should be able to construct a smooth function that has $f'(x)$ as its partial derivative at $x$ , then solve the smoothed problem with a standard application of Lagrange multipliers. (Aside: my goal is actually not to find a method to optimize the function.  I have a method for optimizing such functions, and I'm trying to develop some theoretical understanding of the solutions that it produces.  In particular, I'm trying to understand if proving that a solution satisfies the condition described in the Proposal section is meaningful.)","['optimization', 'multivariable-calculus', 'non-smooth-optimization', 'lagrange-multiplier', 'non-smooth-analysis']"

In other words, the characteristic of $ F$ does not divide $ |G|$. When $ T$ is already an $ FG$-module homomorphism: $ \bar T(v) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum\limits_{g \in G} g^{-1} T(g(v)) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum\limits_{g \in G} g^{-1} gT(v) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum\limits_{g \in G} T(v) = T(v)$ In essence, we would like $ g^{-1}T(g(v))$ to just be $T(v)$ for any linear transformation $ T$, but it's not. So we form a function by taking averages and trying to water down the deviation. And it works! We end up with an honest $ FG$-module morphism.

Can we turn set maps into equivariant maps in the G-set setting? Or something different like averaging continuous maps to get smooth ones.

Now I am attempting to rule out the case $n_q=p^2$:  Assume $n_q=p^2$.  Then $p^2\equiv1\mod q\implies (p+1)(p-1)\equiv0\mod q\implies q$ must divide $(p+1)$ since $p<q$ and $q$ prime.

So the problem I'm looking for some help with: I am working on designing a layout for a graphic design project where I would like to arrange a series of photographs within a frame.

Each photograph is a rectangle A border must be provided.  Each photograph must be at least that distance away from the other photographs and the frame $n$ number of photographs will be provided (where $n > 0$ and say, $n< 20$).  The photographs will be in both landscape and portrait orientation. The dimensions of the frame will be provided where the area of the frame must be at least enough to contain the provided photographs at exactly the border width away from each other and the frame.

I interpret it as follows: a measurable set behaves locally as an interval, measure-wise. I ask for the following: Other, perhaps more correct interpretations Intuition for why this is true? The only intuition I know is that the theorem is easy consequence in the case of an open set, and a measurable set is almost a $G_{\delta}$ set (intersection of countably many open sets). Interesting proofs (I know a proof that uses the regulairy of Lebesgue measure, i.e., the ability to approximate the measure of set $E$ arbitrarily close by closed\open sets contained\containing $E$. Are there any different proofs?) A direct consequence of the lemma is that for almost all $x\in E$ we have: $\forall h>0 m(E\cap (x-h,x+h)) > 0$. Is there a simple proof for this, not using Lebesgue's Density Theorem? With my intuition, a nowhere dense closed set (closed set that doesn't contain an interval) of positive measure (say, 'thick' Cantor set) might contradict the theorem (but it doesn't).

Want to improve this question? Update the question so it's on-topic for Mathematics Stack Exchange. Closed 12 years ago . Improve this question You might have read about the fortuitous meeting between Montgomery and Dyson . The background is that the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, when normalized to have unit spacing on average, (seem to) have the pair correlation function $1-\mathrm{sinc}^2(x)$, where $\mathrm{sinc}$ is the normalized function $\sin(\pi x)/ (\pi x)$. It's still a conjecture but it has good numerical support . So what about prime numbers? Let $\Sigma(x,u)$ be the number of pairs of primes $p,q\le x$ which satisfy the inequality $0\le p-q\le u\,x/\pi(x)$, where $\pi(x)$ is the prime counting function. This inequality is chosen because multiplying primes by $\pi(x)/x$ will ensure the gaps between consecutives is exactly unity (hence they are normalized). Then what might $$g(u)=\frac{d}{du}\left(\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\Sigma(x,u)}{\pi(x)}\right)$$ end up looking like? This basically asks, ""what is the density of normalized primes around so-and-so apart from each other?"" (You can see the original Montgomery conjecture as equation 12 here .

Since $nH\leq nG$, this induces a homomorphism $f_n:H/nH\to G/nG$ given by $f_n(h\mod nH)=h\mod nG$. (1) Show that if $\gcd(n,m)=1$, then $f_n$ is an isomorphism.

Then we would have $f_n$ is an injective homomorphism between two groups of size $n$, hence an isomorphism. $|\ker f_n|$ certainly divides $n$ by Lagrange since it is a subgroup of $H/nH$ which has order $n$.
