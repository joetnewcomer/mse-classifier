147661,Why is $1+a(t-1)$ a unit?,"Let $R$ be a (noncommutative) ring and $a \in R$ such that $a(1-a)$ is nilpotent. Why is $1+a(t-1)$ a unit in $R[t,t^{-1}]$? Probably one just has to write down an inverse element, but I could not find it. Perhaps there is a trick related to the geometric series which motivates the choice of the inverse element, which can be actually made into a formal proof because the series is finite since $a(1-a)$ is nilpotent? Here is a proof that the two-sided ideal generated by $1+a(t-1)$ is $R[t,t^{-1}]$ (which already finishes the proof when $R$ is commutative): Let $A$ be the quotient, we have to show $A=0$. Now, $A$ contains elements $a,t$ such that $a(1-a)$ is nilpotent, $t$ is invertible and $(1-a) + ta = 0$. If we multiply this equation by $a^u (1-a)^v$, we see that $a^{u+1}(1-a)^v=0 \Rightarrow a^u (1-a)^v = 0$ as well as $a^u (1-a)^{v+1} = 0 \Rightarrow a^u (1-a)^v = 0$ for all $u,v \geq 0$. Since $a(1-a)$ is nilpotent, we get by induction that $a$ and $1-a$ are nilpotent. But $a$ nilpotent implies that $1-a$ is a unit, so it can only be nilpotent when $A=0$. As mt_ mentions below, the general case may be reduced to the commutative case by working with the commutative subring $\mathbb{Z}[a] \subseteq R$. Anyway, I would like to know if there is a short proof which just writes down the inverse. EDIT: I would also like to know why the converse is true: When $1+a(t-1)$ is a unit, why is $a(1-a)$ nilpotent? Rosenberg claims this in his book without proof (he only says ""by the same reasoning as in ..."", but this doesn't work the same!). Here, we cannot assume that $R$ is commutative, since the inverse may contain coefficients which do not lie in $\mathbb{Z}[a]$.

147668,Wedge product of Hochschild cohomology classes in characteristic $2$,"Let $A$ be a smooth commutative $k$ -algebra, for $k$ a commutative ring.

147783,How to find the tangent space to a matrix space,"I have a hard time approaching these types of problems.

Without giving a solution could you give me a hint on how do you start solving such problems?

147784,How to calculate separable closures of an algebraic extension?,"In my study of fields, the notion of the separability of an algebraic field extension is one of the more slippery concepts I have encountered thusfar. What is particularly vexing to me is the notion of a separable closure. Let $E/F$ be an algebraic field extension. The separable closure of $F$ in $E$ is defined to be the subfield $E_{sep}=\{\alpha \in E \; | \; \alpha $ is separable over $ F \}$ . While the concept of a separable closure is easy enough to understand based on the definition, the actual calculation of a separable closure $E_{sep}$ for a given algebraic field extension $E/F$ is not obvious to me. For example, I was recently assigned the following problem: Let $k=\mathbb{F}_2(t)$ , $\alpha$ be a root of $X^4+tX^2+t\in k[X]$ in an algebraic closure of $k$ and $K=k(\alpha)$ , where $\mathbb{F_2}=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ . Determine $K_{sep}$ and $[K_{sep}:K]$ . My first thought is that since the separability of an element $a$ of the algebraic field extension $E/F$ is defined based on the structure of its minimal polynomial $m_{a,F}(X) \in F[X]$ , we can use this to determine the elements of $E_{sep}$ . An element $e \in E$ is inseparable if and only if $m_{e,F}(X)=g(X^p)$ for some separable $g(X) \in F[X]$ . So the separable elements of $E$ are those whose minimal polynomial is not an element of $F[X^p]$ . This, however, does not seems to be a tractable idea. My questions are How does one approach the problem of calculation the separable closure of an algebraic extension, like, for example, the one above? If there is no general, one-size-fits-all method, what are some examples of techniques used to deduce the separable closure? Note: any questions asked herein are not current homework questions.","['extension-field', 'separable-extension', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

147862,Clarification: Viewing $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a probabilistic state space,"In this MathOverflow post on visualizing high-dimensional spaces, Terry Tao states that ""the fact that most of the mass of a unit ball in high dimensions lurks near the boundary of the ball can be interpreted as a manifestation of the law of large numbers, using the interpretation of a high-dimensional vector space as the state space for a large number of trials of a random variable."" What exactly does he mean? -- The only interpretation I've come up with is the following: Observing n trials of a random variable (for instance $X \sim U(0,1)$) is equivalent to picking a random point inside an n -dimensional unit cube. For large n , most of the volume of the n -dimensional unit cube is near the edges. Thus our point is likely to be near an edge of the cube, which means one of our trials has a large value. This shows some law of rare events: ""given enough trials, a rare event will occur"". However, this interpretation must use an n -cube rather than an n -sphere because the trials are independent. Additionally, our conclusion is not the law of large numbers, which states that the average of our trials will converge to the expected value for large n . Can someone provide a correct interpretation of Tao's comment? Thanks!","['vector-spaces', 'probability']"

\begin{align}
y&=\sqrt{1-(x-2)^2}\\
y&=mx

mx&=\sqrt{1-(x-2)^2}\\
m&=\frac{\sqrt{1-(x-2)^2}}{x}

Is it possible that $M_\mathfrak{p} \ne 0$ for some prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ not contained in $\mathfrak{m}$? Intuitively/geometrically, this doesn't seem possible. What we have here is a coherent sheaf on $\operatorname{Spec} R_\mathfrak{m}$ and its direct image on $\operatorname{Spec} R$. What I want to argue is that for any point $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\operatorname{Spec} R$, $\mathfrak{p} \ne \mathfrak{m}$, there is an open neighbourhood $U$ of $\mathfrak{p}$ not containing $\mathfrak{m}$, and so therefore sections of $M$ over $U$ must be $0$... but this isn't quite true, since the image of $\operatorname{Spec} R_\mathfrak{m}$ is not just $\{ \mathfrak{m} \}$. We know that $\mathfrak{p}$ is in the support of $M$ if and only if $\mathfrak{p}$ contains the annihilator of $M$. To show that $\mathfrak{p}$ is not in the support of $M$, we must exhibit an element of $R \setminus \mathfrak{p}$ that annihilates $M$. But why does such an element exist? In case the answer to my very first question is ""yes"", let's add more hypotheses: suppose $R$ is a Dedekind domain. Then $\operatorname{Spec} R_\mathfrak{m}$ consists of an open point and a closed point, and the sections/stalk over the open point must be $0$ because $M$ is a torsion $R_\mathfrak{m}$-module.

I believe this, but I don't understand why it is the case. What it breaks down to (in my mind) is this: If you vary an angle (theta) of a right triangle linearly from zero,
then the height of the triangle is harmonic (plots out sine). In more concrete terms You have a pole lying on the ground. You slowly lift the pole, so that
the angle between pole and ground increases linearly. At what rate
does the height of the tip of the pole increase? I understand quite well that the answer to the above is $\sin(\theta)$, but I don't understand why that is the case. Can you prove either of the above statements without using $sine$ or the unit circle? I can imagine proofs where, for example, you prove that because you are increasing the angle linearly the tip of the pole rises vertically with acceleration inversely proportional to it's height (i.e. utilizing the $y''=-y$ definition of harmonics), but I can't construct such a proof without presupposing the behavior of sine. That's the sort of proof I'm looking for.

147998,$C_0$ Convergence of Metrics under Ricci Flow when $\chi(M) = 0$.,"I am a beginning graduate student, and I am trying to learn basic aspects of Ricci Flow via the uniformization theorem for compact surfaces.  I am reading Chow and Knopf's introductory book as well as Hamilton's original paper on the subject.  I have a question regarding the following theorem: Theorem : If $(M^2, g_0)$ is a compact surface with metric $g_0$, then a 1-parameter family of metrics $g(t)$ with $g(0) = g_0$ under the Normalized Ricci-Flow equation:
$$
\frac{\partial g}{\partial t} = - (R_g - r) g
$$
exists for all time and converges in every $C^k$-norm to a metric of constant scalar curvature.  Here $R$ is the scalar curvature and $r = \int_M R_g d\mu_{g}/\int_{M}d \mu_{g} $ is the average scalar curvature.  $r$ is constant by the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem. The proof is divided into three cases, each of increasing difficulty: $r < 0$, $r = 0$, and $r>0$.  I have a question only about the $r = 0$ case.  The idea for both $r = 0$ and $r<0$ is to apply the maximum principle to quantities related to gradient-ricci solitons. In Knopf and Chow's book, they prove that the metrics are equivalent for all time when $r \leq 0$ (Proposition 5.15).  Then they say that it is enough to that $R$ and all of it's derivatives go to zero as $t \to \infty$.  However, they show that $|R| \leq C/(1+t)$, where $C>0$.  This function is not in $L^1([0, \infty))$ and the hypothesis:
$$
\int_0^\infty \left|\frac{\partial g}{\partial t}\right|_{g(t)} dt < \infty
$$
does not apply (See Lemma 6.49 in Chow and Knopf).  This hypothesis is used to show the metrics converge uniformly. On the other hand Hamilton's paper, he shows that integral bounds of $R$ and its first two derivatives decay exponentially with time.  Then he uses a Sobolev Inequality to get that $|R_{\max}|$ decays expontially, too.  Then the hypothesis above is satisfied by the Normalized-Ricci Flow equation. Question: Is there a basic fact that Chow and Knopf are exploiting that implies that $g$ converges in $C_0$?  They are excellent at including relevant details and have a good view of this subject, so I am eager to know how they are thinking about this.","['ricci-flow', 'differential-geometry']"

I am quite interested in mathematical questions, but I am not good enough at mathematics to see immediately that the bold statement above is true, so I tried to look it up in the literature.

148093,Algebras over a field are flat - category theoretic proof?,"Let $k$ be a field. Assume that you already know that the category $\mathrm{Alg}(k)$ of $k$-algebras (everything here is commutative and unital) has a coproduct $\sqcup$. But you don't know that this actually comes from the tensor product of vector spaces over $k$. You just know the universal property of $A \sqcup B$ (aka $A \otimes_k B$). From this you can deduce: $\sqcup$ is commutative and associative up to natural isomorphisms $(A/I) \sqcup B \cong (A \sqcup B) / \langle i_A(I) \rangle$ $A \sqcup k[x_1,\dotsc,x_n] \cong A[x_1,\dotsc,x_n]$ $A \sqcup -$ commutes with colimits In particular, we can compute the tensor product of arbitrary algebras using presentations:
$$k[\{x_i\}]/I \sqcup k[\{y_j\}]/J \cong k[\{x_i\},\{y_j\}]/\langle I,J \rangle$$ Question. How can we prove that for every injective homomorphism $\phi : A \to B$ of $k$-algebras the induced homomorphism $\phi \sqcup \mathrm{id} : A \sqcup C \to B \sqcup C$ is also injective for every $k$-algebra $C$? For example, this is clear when $C$ is a polynomial algebra over $k$. In general, $C$ is free as a module over $k$, but we cannot use the isomorphism $C \cong k^{(I)}$ since this leaves the category of $k$-algebras. Background: I assist a lecture where the students have just learned what the tensor product of algebras is, without knowing the tensor product of modules. Now they have to believe somehow some of the well-known properties, because they are usually proven with the help of the tensor product of modules. But perhaps we can do it with algebras alone. Since the lecture is about elementary algebraic geometry, you may assume that $k$ is algebraically closed and some basic results about affine varieties (but not about their fiber products ;)). Appendix: Further properties which follow from the universal property: 1) Let us denote the coproduct inclusions by $i_A : A \to A \sqcup B$ and $i_B : B \to A \sqcup B$. It is easy to see that $\otimes : A \times B \to A \sqcup B, (a,b) \mapsto i_A(a) \cdot i_B(b)$ is $k$-bilinear and that the span of the image generates $A \sqcup B$ (since the image satisfies the same universal property). 2) When $A,B \neq 0$, then we also have $A \otimes_k B \neq 0$. Geometrically: The fiber product of two non-empty schemes is non-empty. Proof: Since the zero algebra only maps to the zero algebra, we may replace $A,B$ by quotients. In particular, we may assume that $A,B$ are field extensions of $k$. Let $P$ be a transzendence basis of $A/k$ and $Q$ one of $B/k$. Let $M$ be a set containing disjoint copies of $P$ and $Q$ and let $C$ be the algebraic closure of $k(M)$. Then there are maps $A \to C$ and $B \to C$, which induce by the universal property a map $A \sqcup B \to C$. Since $C \neq 0$, we also have $A \sqcup B \neq 0$.","['tensor-products', 'category-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
148094,Erdős Probabilistic method,"My question is based on the Erdos probabilistic method. I am trying to read from the paper here . The proof of Theorem 1 contains the statement Since a block sequence is monochromatic with probability $2^{1−k}$, it follows from the linearity of expectation that the expected number of monochromatic k-term quasi-progressions under a random coloring is at most $2N^2(c/2)^k/(k − 1)$. Essentially as I understand the probablistic argument should run as follows: The probability of a particular event $A$ is $2^{1−k}$. We then conclude that the probability of the occuurence of any such event is bounded above by $2^{1−k}\times$ the number of such possible events. The number of possible events is bounded above as per the previous arguments (according to my understanding) in the paper by $N(N-k+1)c^k/(k − 1)$, and forcing $2N(N-k+1)(c/2)^k/(k − 1)$ to be less then $1$ will give us a bound for $N$ within which if $N$ is chosen the desired event is not guaranteed and hence we have a lower bound. What I am unclear is about the following: The reference to the expected number ? Why is $2N(N-k+1)(c/2)^k/(k − 1)$ not used instead of $2N^2(c/2)^k/(k − 1)$ ?

148134,Concrete examples of 2-categories,"I've been reading some of John Baez's work on 2-categories (eg here ) and have been trying to visualize some of the constructions he gives. I'm interested in coming up with 'concrete' examples of 2-categories. As an example of what I don't mean, I know that the category Cat forms a 2-category, where the objects are small categories, the morphisms are functors and the 2-morphisms are natural transformations. But this is too abstract for me - given that categorical constructs are what I'm having trouble understanding, it doesn't help me much to give an example from category theory! One thought I had is that you might be able to view a group as a 2-category. Taking the perspective that a group is a category with one object where the morphisms are the symmetries of the object, you should then be able to construct a 2-category by saying that the 2-morphisms are the inner automorphisms of the group. An interesting question is then what the compositional structure of the 2-morphisms is. To be really concrete, consider the group $D_3$. Here the object is an equilateral triangle, and there are six morphisms $e$, $r$, $r^2$, $m$, $mr$ and $mr^2$ where $e$ is the identity, $r$ is rotation by $2\pi/3$ and $m$ is reflection in one of the axes of symmetry, and the others are the obvious compositions of these. Then the 2-morphisms are the functions $\phi_g$ given by $\phi_g(h)=ghg^{-1}$. For this example, the 2-morphisms have the structure of the underlying group $D_3$, but clearly this isn't always the case (e.g. for any abelian group the 2-morphisms have the structure of the trivial group). I haven't worked through many of the details, but it seems like there might be the grain of an interesting line of thought here. So my questions are: Is viewing groups as 2-categories an interesting thing to do, i.e. does it give you any new perspectives that make previously esoteric facts about groups 'obvious', or at least special cases of results in 2-categories?

148327,Variety generated by finite fields,"Let $K_1,\dotsc,K_n$ be finite fields and let $V$ be the variety of rings, generated by the $K_i$ (rings aren't necessarily unital). I want to figure out what $V$ looks like. By a theorem of Tarski, elements of $V$ are the quotients of subrings of direct products of (possibly infinite) families of the $K_i$. But what are these rings exactly? One thing we can figure out are the possible characteristics of the elements of $V$. Since taking subrings and quotients decreases the characteristic and the characteristic of the product is the least common multiple of the characteristics of the factors, any ring in $V$ has a characteristic which is a squarefree integer, whose prime factors are among the characteristics of the $K_i$. On the other hand, not every such ring lives in $V$. For example, the multiplicative semigroup of any ring in $V$ must have finite exponent (since this is true for the products of the $K_i$), which means that things like polynomial rings over $K_i$ can't appear in $V$. I tried looking at the simplest case where $V$ is generated by $\mathbb{Z}_2$, but I can't really picture what's going on. I have a feeling that in this case $V$ will be the class of Boolean rings, but I'm not even sure how to show this.","['abstract-algebra', 'universal-algebra']"

Then $\sin: Y\rightarrow X$ is a covering map. This is clear. Now consider the following curves: $$ u: [0,1] \rightarrow X, u(t) = 1-e^{2\pi i t}$$ and $$ v: [0,1] \rightarrow X, v(t) = -1+e^{2\pi i t} = -u(t)$$ Let $w_1: [0,1]\rightarrow Y$ be the lifting of $u\cdot v$ and $w_2$ be the lifting of $v\cdot u$ with $w_1(0)=w_2(0)=0$. Show that $w_1(1) = 2\pi$ while $w_2(1) = -2\pi$. As of now, I don't have many ideas how to solve this. Of course, the inverse sine is a multi-valued function so the two liftings should use different branches. But I don't see how exactly they come into play. I'm also not sure whether the solution can be done by calculations alone or if there is some more general principle underlying. Any suggestions would be welcome.","['covering-spaces', 'riemann-surfaces', 'complex-analysis']"

A lot of books give a rather complicated proof using quite a lot of estimation. I am just wondering whether the following proof, which looks completely natural for me, makes sense. Proof. Let $f(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$ . $\displaystyle\int_{\partial R}f(z)dz=\int_{L_1}f(z)dz+\int_{L_2}f(z)dz+\int_{L_3}f(z)dz+\int_{L_4}f(z)dz$ , where $L_1,L_2,L_3,L_4$ are the four sides of the rectangle.

=I_1+iI_2$ ,

By Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Fubini's Theorem, we have $I_1=\displaystyle\int_{a}^b\int_{c}^{d} -\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y}-\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial x}dydx$ and $I_2=\displaystyle\int_{a}^b\int_{c}^{d} -\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial y}+\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x}dydx$ Since $f$ is analytic, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann Equations: $-\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y}-\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial x}=-\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial y}+\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x}=0$ So $I_1=I_2=0$ .

$e^{-x}\leq \frac{1}{(1+x/n)^{n}}$ I've tried to use that the integrand is measurable and subtract out different measurable sets from the integral to make it more convenient.. I've been playing with this on and off for a month or so and no luck. I appreciate any help here. Update:
From mixedmath's suggestion splitting it into $[0,10]$ and $[10,\infty]$
it is clear that the integrand is dominated on $[0,10]$ (say by 1) and so
lebesgue sends that portion to 0. On the larger interval I am still running into a problem making it bounded nicely. If I try a $u$ sub the bounds get messy. I would like to choose an $n$ so that $2e^{-x} \leq (1+x/n)^n$ for all $x\in [10,\infty]$ .. maybe: there exists an $N$ such that for all $n\geq N$ $e^{10}/2 < (1+10/n)^{n}$ but for $x>10$.. $e^{10}/2<(1+10/n)^{n}<(1+x/n)^{n}$ but that's not quite right..","['integration', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

148676,Matrix transformation mapped onto itself,"Question: $$A= \begin{pmatrix} k & -2 \\ 1-k & k \end{pmatrix}\text{, where k is a constant}$$ $$\text {A transformation } T : \mathbb{R}^2  \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}^2 \text{ is  represented by the matrix A.}$$ $$\text {Find the value of k for which the line } y = 2x \text{ is mapped onto itself under T.}$$ Working: $$\begin{pmatrix} k & -2 \\ 1-k & k \end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix} x \\ 2x \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} x \\ 2x \end{pmatrix}$$
$$\begin{pmatrix} x(k-4) \\ x(1+k)  \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} x \\ 2x \end{pmatrix}$$
$$x(k-4)=x$$
$$x(1+k)=2x$$ Leaving me with $k=5$ and $k=1$, However the answer is $k = 9$ why?",['matrices']

148683,Expression for set of ones,"I am trying to a formal expression for a set $S$ of $T$ number of ones. $ S = \{1,1,1,1,....T$ times $\}$. Currently I have written it in this way: $ S = \{n_i | n_i = 1, \forall i \in [1,T] \}$. Is this expression correct? Are there better ways of writing the same thing?","['notation', 'elementary-set-theory']"
148711,Mappings from $\omega_1$,"We've been studying various properties of $\omega_1$ (equipped with the order topology), and I recently came across these questions. Can anyone help? If $f$ maps $\omega_1$ onto a metric space $X$ and $f$ is continuous, why is $X$ compact? Also, why does there exist $\alpha \in \omega_1$ such that $f$ maps the interval $[0, \alpha]$ onto $X$?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'ordinals']"
