1712645,Three angles are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$?,"If$$\tan \alpha = 1, \text{ }\tan \beta = {3\over 2}, \text{ }\tan \gamma = 2,$$then does it follow that $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$? It is possible to test combinations $m\alpha+n\beta+\ell\gamma$ with some small integer coefficients $m,n,\ell$. The tool for doing that is the sum formula for tangents of two angles with known tangents:
$$
\tan(x\pm y)=\frac{\tan x\pm\tan y}{1\mp\tan x\tan y}.
$$
For example, judging from a picture $\beta+2\gamma$ is relatively close to $\pi=4\alpha$, but the calculations:
$$
\tan 2\gamma=\frac{2+2}{1-2\cdot2}=-\frac43,
$$
$$
\tan(\beta+2\gamma)=\frac{3/2-4/3}{1+(3/2)(4/3)}=\frac1{18}
$$

1712830,Is a projective curve minus finite number of points affine?,"The answer to the question in the title is ""yes"". This is proved for example here , or here (page 5). However, I seem to be able to construct a counterexample. Can you help me find the flaw in my argument? Let $E$ be an elliptic curve, say over $\mathbb C$. Then $E-\{0\}$ is the spectrum of a Dedekind domain $R$, and has class group isomorphic to $E(\mathbb C)$. (Because $\mathrm{Cl}(E)=E(\mathbb C)\times \mathbb Z$, and $\mathrm{Cl}(E-\{0\})$ is the quotient of $\mathrm{Cl}(E)$ by the cyclic subgroup generated by $[0]$.) Now the class group of $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ is just the ideal class group of $R$. Take a non-torsion point of $E$, considered as a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $R$. I claim that $S:=\mathrm{Spec} (R)-\{\mathfrak{p}\}$ is not affine. Let $T=\Gamma (S,\mathcal O_S)=\{ {{a}\over{b}}\in Q(R) |b\notin \mathfrak{q}\in \mathrm{Spec}(R),\mathfrak{q}\neq \mathfrak{p}\}$. I will show that $T=R$. It suffices to show that every element $x\in \mathfrak {p}$ is also contained in some other prime ideal than $\mathfrak p$. Were it not so, then the principal ideal $(x)$ would be equal to $\mathfrak{p}^n$ for some $n$, by the unique prime decomposition of ideals in Dedekind domains. But the image of $\mathfrak{p}$ in the ideal class group is a non-torsion element, so no power of $\mathfrak{p}$ can be a principal ideal. Therefore $T=R$, and $S\neq\mathrm{Spec}(R)=\mathrm{Spec}(T)$, and hence $S$ is not affine. ($S$ and $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ really are nonisomorphic, because for instance they have different etale fundamental groups)","['algebraic-geometry', 'curves', 'proof-verification', 'elliptic-curves', 'dedekind-domain']"

1712933,Why does changing variables work?,"I am slightly ashamed to be asking this, but I have been recently reflecting on changing variables in very simple problems. If I missed a question that already discusses this please point it out to me and I will delete this one.
Anyhow writing this will probably be a learning experience. Directly from the Wikipedia page on the argument I take as an example the equation: $$x^6 - 9 x^3 + 8 = 0. \, $$ I quickly recognize this as a high school problem and use the methods that were taught to me, namely I set $x^3 = u$ so $x = u^{1/3}$. Then I proceed to solve quadratic equation that results from this substitution, and only at the end I apply the reverse transformation $x^3 = u$ to get an answer for my starting variable. With not much imagination I always thought that the function used when changing variables (in the above case $f(x) = x^3)$ should be bijective in the domain of interest of the starting equation. This is because I need the inverse to return to my ""starting variable"". But I notice on Wikipedia that a bit more is required; the change of variable function should be a diffeomorphism, we need differentiability (and even smooth manifolds for the domain and the image). This is where I realized that I was never taught a proof of why the change of variables method work or how it works but I was just applying these substitutions blindly. So could someone kindly point me to a source where I can improve my understanding on this very powerful method by adding rigour to what I am doing and possibly even a geometric interpretation.",['real-analysis']

While trying to prove this, I reached the result that convergence is uniform, which sounds absurd. I'd like to see the error in my reasoning and see a proof of this fact (that doesn't depend on measure theory): Fix $\varepsilon$ Let $E_n=\{x\in[0;1] / f_n(x)>\varepsilon\}$ Let $A_k=\cup_k^\infty E_n$. Finally, let $A=\cap_1^\infty \overline{A_k}$. There are two cases: 1) $A=\emptyset$. Then, since each $\overline{A_k}$ is compact and $\overline{A_{k+1}}\subset\overline{A_k}$ then $A_K$ is empty for some $A_K$. Thus, $E_n=\emptyset\ \forall n>K$. Thus, convergence is uniform. 2) $A\neq\emptyset$. Then, some $x$ belongs to $\overline{A_k}\forall k$. Then, $f_n(x)\geq\varepsilon\ \forall n_i$ and $n_i$ an infinite subsequence of the integers which means that $f_n(x)$ doesn't converge to $0$.

Somehow this always seemed like magic to me, so I'm always looking for approaches I find more straightforwardly comprehensible. On the other hand, because of the relationship between conformal and complex geometry in (real) dimension 2, this is equivalent to solving the Yamabe problem (which was originally stated as a generalization of uniformization): does every conformal class of metrics contain one of constant scalar curvature? Let's quickly recall the formula for the change of scalar curvature in dimension 2 under conformal change of metric: $$S(e^f g) = e^{-f}(S(g)+\Delta_g f).$$ (Note that here we are using the $g$-Laplacian of $f$.) Fix a metric on either $\Bbb R^2$ or $S^2$. Can we directly solve this equation for the appropriate choice of constant on the LHS, leading to a more Riemannian-flavored solution to the uniformization theorem?

The setup: Let $X$ be a set and $\{U_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\subset 2^X$ a family of subsets of $X$ that is closed under finite intersection, so it serves as a base for a topology $\mathscr{T}$. Let $\mathscr{F}$ be the smallest family of subsets of $X$ that contains $\mathscr{T}$ and is closed under complementation and finite intersection. By exercise 20 of ch. 7 in AM, $\mathscr{F}$ is equivalently the family of finite unions of locally closed sets. AM defines this as the constructible sets in exercise 21 of the same chapter. Meanwhile, let $\mathscr{G}$ be the coarsest topology in which every $U_\lambda$ is clopen. In exercises 27-28 of chapter 3 of AM, it is shown that if $X$ is the Spec of a ring $B$ and the $U_\lambda$'s are the standard basic opens of the Zariski topology, then this is precisely the topology in which the images in $X$ of the Specs of all $B$-algebras are taken as the closed sets. AM defines this as the constructible topology in exercise 27. AM notes that the closed sets are exactly the images of Specs, so I infer that it is the closed sets of this topology (i.e. the image in $2^X$ of the family $\mathscr{G}$ under complementation of each member; call it $\mathscr{G}^c$) that AM means to refer to as constructible. $\mathscr{F}$ is not equal to $\mathscr{G}$ or $\mathscr{G}^c$ in the generality in which I've defined them. In fact $\mathscr{G}$ depends on the base $\{U_\lambda\}$ chosen for $\mathscr{T}$ whereas $\mathscr{F}$ only depends on $\mathscr{T}$. See hot_queen's answer to my question linked above for beautiful simple examples of the differences. (I framed that question in terms of $\mathscr{F}$ vs. $\mathscr{G}$, since I forgot the context in AM ch. 3 of the def. of $\mathscr{G}$, but the examples show the same for $\mathscr{G}^c$ because $\mathscr{F}$ is invariant under complementation.) I assume, however, since AM is using the same word for them, that if $X$ is the Spec of a noetherian ring, $\mathscr{T}$ is the Zariski topology, and $\{U_\lambda\}$ are the standard basic sets $X_f$ of this topology (i.e. the Specs of the localizations of the underlying ring at single elements), then $\mathscr{F}$ coincides with $\mathscr{G}^c$. So: My questions: 1) Is this true? (I.e. that $\mathscr{F}=\mathscr{G}^c$ if $X$ is the Spec of a Noetherian ring, $\mathscr{T}$ is the Zariski topology, and the $\{U_\lambda\}$'s are the standard Zariski basis opens?) 2) If yes, which if any of these assumptions can be loosened? Does it remain true if we use a different base for the Zariski topology (e.g. the whole topology)? If yes, does it matter what base? If it doesn't, can the statement be loosened to if we just assume $(X,\mathscr{T})$ is a noetherian space (rather than the Spec of a noetherian ring)? And what are the proofs and/or counterexamples?

1713428,A certain generalization of flag varieties,"The most standard notion of a (partial) flag is the sequence of vector subspaces ordered by inclusion,
$$
V_1\subset V_2\subset \ldots \subset V_k=V.
$$
Given the dimensions of the subspaces $\dim V_i=d_i$, $d_k=n$, one can describe the variety of such flags by a quotient $G/P$ for $G=Gl_n$ and $P$ a parabolic subgroup. The standard generalization of this notion is obtained by taking a more general $G$, and for algebraic groups there is a nice theory, which shows that the corresponding partial flag variety $G/P$ is projective and has much more say about it. For the case of classical groups such as $SO_n$, the partial flag variety has a geometrical meaning as a space of approrpriately constrained flags in an inner product space $V$. No matter what is the explicit construction, the group $SO_n$ acts transitively on such flags. What I want is a more general notion of a flag in inner product space. Consider, for example, a flag of the form
$$
V_1\subset V_2\subset V,
$$
where $\dim V_1=1, \dim V_2=2, \dim V=n$, and $V$ is an inner product space over $\mathbb{C}$ (i.e. equipped with non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form). I require of this flag that $(x,x)=0$ for any $x\in V_1$. Note that $SO_n$ does not act transitively on the space $F$ of such flags -- $V_2$ can be orthogonal to $V_1$, or it can be in generic position. So $F$ cannot be possibly described as a quotient of $SO_n\mathbb{C}$. However, as far as I understand, almost all of $F$ is a single orbit of $SO_n \mathbb{C}$ -- I mean those flags when $V_2$ is in a generic position. So almost all of $F$ is of the form $SO_n\mathbb{C}/H$, for some subgroup $H$. Is there a standard algebraic-geometric approach to such spaces $F$, which will take into account the presence of $SO_n\mathbb{C}?$ Suppose I want to study a ring $R\subset \mathbb{C}[x,y]/\langle(x,x)\rangle$ of polynomials, related to this flag, defined by
$$
f(x,y+\alpha x)=f(x,y)\quad \mathrm{mod}\, (x,x),
$$
for $x, y\in V$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{C}$. Such polynomials can intuitively be considered as homogeneous functions on $V$. Can I describe the ring $R$ as some sort of coordinate ring for $F$ and possibly link it to representation theory on $SO_n\mathbb{C}$? I am asking about representation theory here because I can describe $R$ by an ad-hoc calculation, and the representations of $SO_n\mathbb{C}$ play an important role in this description. I am also thinking about similar question for $SO_n\mathbb{C}/P$, when there is Borel-Weil theorem, etc.","['polynomials', 'representation-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

The Sylow theorems say that there are Sylow $2$ subgroups of order $4$ and Sylow $3$ subgroups of order $9$ . The possible numbers of Sylow $2$ subgroups are $1,3,9$ The possible numbers of Sylow $3$ subgroups are $1,4$ Suppose $G$ has $4$ Sylow $3$ subgroups, each subgroup has $8$ non identity elements, total $32$ non identity elements from $4$ Sylow subgroups. Remaining $4$ elements would become one Sylow $2$ subgroups. This says that if $G$ has $4$ Sylow $3$ subgroups then $G$ has $1$ Sylow $2$ subgroup and thus, this Sylow $2$ subgroup is normal and so $G$ is not simple. Suppose $G$ has $1$ Sylow $3$ subgroup then it is a normal subgroup and so $G$ is simple. In this case we can not decide on the number of Sylow $2$ subgroups.. It can be any one of $1,3,9$ .. I can classify abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}_4\times \mathbb{Z}_9$ $\mathbb{Z}_4\times \mathbb{Z}_3\times \mathbb{Z}_3$ $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_9$ $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_3\times \mathbb{Z}_3\cong \mathbb{Z}_6\times\mathbb{Z}_6$ One more piece of information is that if there are $4$ Sylow $3$ -subgroups then there is exactly one Sylow $2$ subgroup so normal.. If there is only one Sylow $3$ subgroups it is normal... So, any such group has either a normal Sylow $2$ subgroup or a Sylow $3$ subgroup..

proportions) it looks like there is more than one curve on it; I want to know how many curves there are on it; The points at $n = 22$ and at $n = 44$ are close to 0 (because they're close to multiples of $\pi$, whose sine is 0); The point 44 starts the middle sine curve; There are 44 sin curves.

1713443,Mental $n-$th root of $N$,"It has been a while since I started thinking about this problem: a fast method to evaluate (in an approximate way) mentally the $n-$th root of a number $N$. I'm talking about great numbers, because otherwise one could handle with the first terms of a Taylor series. I found time ago a really cute approximation for the square root, which runs like this: you have $N$, and you always can write $N$ as $$N = q^2 + s$$ Where $q^2$ is the nearest $N$ perfect square, and $s$ is the remainder. Trivial example: $50 = 49 + 1$. Thanks to that, one can approximate $$\sqrt{N} = \sqrt{q^2 \pm s} \approx q \pm \frac{s}{2q}$$ Fast example $$\sqrt{43} = \sqrt{36 + 7} \approx 6 + \frac{7}{12} = 6 + 0.58333 = 6.58333(..)$$ Where actually $$\sqrt{43} = 6.55743(...)$$ So somehow one may compute it mentally in a quite easy and fast way. The $n-$th problem I started then to think about if such a method could be generalized for some $n-$th square root. With intuition (and a lot of naiveness) I thought about a sort of ""mathematical symmetry"", something like $$\sqrt[n]{N} = \sqrt[n]{q^n \pm s} \approx q \pm \frac{s}{nq^{n-1}}$$ But I don't know if that may work in general. For example: $$\sqrt[4]{600} = \sqrt[4]{625 - 25} = \sqrt[4]{5^4 - 25} \approx 5 - \frac{25}{4\cdot 5^{4-1}} = 5 - 0.05 = 4.95$$ And surprisingly $$4.95^4 = 600.3725(...)$$ BUT if we mind with the plus sign... $$\sqrt[4]{600} = \sqrt[4]{256 + 344} = \sqrt[4]{4^4 + 344} \approx 4 + \frac{344}{4\cdot 4^3} = 1.34375 = 5.34375$$ Where $$5.34375^4 = 815.4259(...)$$ So it seems like it works if we pick the correct sign namely when the remainder $s$ is quite small. What I'm asking for is for the existence of a pretty simple form to approximate roots, namely something like $$\sqrt[n]{N} = \sqrt[n]{q^n + s} \approx q + f(s, q, n)$$ In which $f(s, q, n)$ is some good simple function (simple = not a sum of terms, just one). Or my ""intuition"" is good enough to work?

1713455,Examples of classes $\mathcal{C}$ of structures such that every finite group is isomorphic to the automorphism group of a structure in $\mathcal{C}$,"Since it is not the case that every group is the automorphism group of a group (see Is every group the automorphism group of a group? ), it is natural to ask: what are some examples of classes $\mathcal{C}$ of structures such that for each finite group $G$, there exists a structure $C$ of class $\mathcal{C}$ such that $\text{Aut}(C) \cong G$? As discussed in Peter Cameron's Automorphisms of graphs , a class $\mathcal{C}$ of structures is said to be universal if every finite group is the automorphism group of a structure in $\mathcal{C}$. As indicated in this article, the following classes of structures are universal: $\bullet$ The class of graphs ( Frucht's theorem ); $\bullet$ The class of trivalent graphs; $\bullet$ The class of graphs of valency $k$ for fixed $k > 2$; $\bullet$ The class of bipartite graphs; $\bullet$ The class of strongly regular graphs ; $\bullet$ The class of Hamiltonian graphs ; $\bullet$ The class of $k$-connected graphs for $k \in \mathbb{N}$; $\bullet$ The class of $k$-chromatic graphs for $k > 1$; $\bullet$ The class of finite distributive lattices ; $\bullet$ Switching classes of graphs ; $\bullet$ The class of projective planes ; $\bullet$ The class of Steiner triple systems ; and $\bullet$ The class of balanced incomplete block designs . It is also known that: $\bullet$ The class of matroids is universal, as shown in the article On the automorphism group of a matroid ; $\bullet$ The class of finite posets is universal, as shown in the article Automorphism groups of finite posets ; and $\bullet$ The class of complete, connected, locally connected metric spaces of any fixed positive dimension is universal, as discussed in the following link: Automorphism group of a topological space ; $\bullet$ The class of directed acyclic graphs is universal, as discussed in the following link: Can any finite group be realized as the automorphism group of a directed acyclic graph? ; and $\bullet$ The class of finite orthomodular lattices is universal, as proven in the article Every finite group is the automorphism group of some finite orthomodular lattice . Observe that most of the universal classes given above are classes of combinatorial / discrete structures as opposed to algebraic structures defined in terms of binary operations such as monoids and rings, or geometric structures such as manifolds. It is natural to ask: (1) What are some other interesting examples of universal classes of structures? (2) Are there any known examples of universal classes of 'algebraic' structures, i.e. structures endowed with at least one binary operation satisfying certain axioms? Is the class of rings universal? Is the class of monoids universal? Is the class of semigroups universal? (3) Are there any known examples of universal classes of 'geometric' structures, e.g., structures such as smooth manifolds? (4) What are some interesting examples of classes of structures which are known to be non-universal? As shown by Polya, one such example is the class of trees. It is also known that the class of planar graphs is not universal. Also, it is known that any minor-closed class of graphs is not universal.","['abstract-algebra', 'graph-theory', 'group-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1713463,Completions of number fields,"I would like to prove a statement about completions of number fields, but I'm running into a problem. The statement I want to prove is Let $L/K$ be a Galois extension of number fields, $p$ a prime of $K$. Suppose $P_1$, $P_2$ are primes of $L$ lying over $p$. Then $L_{P_1}$ and $L_{P_2}$ are isomorphic as extensions of $K_p$ (the subscript denotes completion at a prime). I am trying to construct an isomorphism $L_{P_1}\to L_{P_2}$ preserving $K_p$. Because $L$ is dense in $L_{P_1}$ and every $K_p$-linear map is continuous, a map of $K_p$ extensions from $L_{P_1}$ to $L_{P_2}$ is determined by its restriction to $L$, and this restriction must take $P_1$ to $P_2$. The Galois group of $L/K$ acts transitively on the primes over $p$, so we can find such a $\sigma\in\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$ taking $P_1$ to $P_2$. Problem: some elements of $L$ are already in $K_p$ (by which I mean there are elements of $K_p\backslash K$ whose image in $L_{P_1}$ is actually in $L$), and these elements are not necessarily fixed by $\sigma$. So it seems that $\sigma$ need not induce an isomorphism of  $K_p$-extensions. Where did I go wrong?

I am NOT looking for a rotation matrix because, as I understand, this does not actually give you the angles of rotation around the three axis'. If there is a way to extrapolate the angles of rotation from a rotation matrix that would work perfectly. One approach I have tried is to take the two 3D vectors and project them onto a 2D plane, in essence ignoring one of the axis. Once in 2D an attempt was made to find an angle of rotation that would align the now 2D vectors. Using this found angle, a 3D rotation was performed on the original 3D vector around the axis that was extrapolated out during the 2D projection. Repeating this three times, once for each axis. This seemed to work for simple single dimensional vectors but for multidimensional vectors incorrect angles were calculated. By single dimensional vectors working, I am referring to finding the angles of rotation needed to rotate for example {1,0,0} to align with {0,1,0}, and multidimensional vectors that are not working for example would be {1,2,3} to {3,1,2}","['matrices', '3d']"

1713629,"Find a harmonic conjugate for the function $u(x,y)=x^{3}+Axy^{2}$ if one exists - $u(x,y)$ might not be harmonic?","For $u(x,y) = x^{3} + Axy^{2}$, where $A$ is a real number, I need to find a harmonic conjugate, or if one does not exist, show that it does not exist. I began my approach to this problem by first checking whether $u(x,y)$ is even harmonic. However, I got that $\displaystyle \frac{\partial ^{2} u}{\partial x^{2}} = 6x$ and $\displaystyle \frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}} = 2Ax$. So, $u(x,y)$ appears to satisfy Laplace's Equation only when $A = -3$ or at $x = 0$ for any $A \in \mathbb{R}$. I believe that in order for $u(x,y)$ to be harmonic, however, it would need to be like analyticity, where Laplace's Equation would need to hold in at least a neighborhood of $x = 0$, the imaginary axis, and not just on the axis itself. But, that is only my intuition. I'm not sure if this is actually true. If so, then we would need $A = -3$. So, I suppose then I could go ahead and try to find a harmonic conjugate in the case where $A$ must be $-3$? I'm a little confused as to how to proceed on this problem.

1713635,Every open subset of $\mathbb R$ is an $F_\sigma$-set and a $G_\delta$-set.,"Prove that every open subset of $\mathbb R$ is an $F_\sigma$-set and a $G_\delta$-set. In order to prove this, the exercise tells me I need to make use of the following previously proven facts: Every open interval in $\mathbb R$ is both $F_\sigma$-set and $G_\delta$-set. $\mathcal B = \{ (a,b) \in \mathbb R: a<b~ \text{and}~ a,b, \in \mathbb Q \}$ is a basis for the Euclidean topology on $\mathbb R$. I have done the following so far: We have proven that every open interval $(a,b) \subset \mathbb R$ is both a $F_\sigma$-set and $G_\delta$-set. We now attempt to prove that every open subset $S \subset \mathbb R$ is also both a $F_\sigma$-set and $G_\delta$-set. Since $S$ is open in $\mathbb R$, we know that it is a union of open intervals, that is 
    \begin{align*}
	S &= \bigcup_{j \in J} (a_j, b_j) \\
	&= \bigcup_{j \in J} \left[ \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \left[ a_j + \frac{1}{n} , b_j - \frac{1}{n}\right]\right],
	 \end{align*} which is a countable union of closed sets. That is, $S$ is an $F_\sigma$-set. I now need help proving that $S$ is also a $G_\delta$-set.

Am I correct in assuming, that there is a need for a set $N$, from which the elements of $S$ are picked, in order to be able do draw conclusions about the expected value? Can we make the set $\mathbb{N}$? How does the problem change if we expand our set to $\mathbb{Q}$? How may I go about constructing a distribution, that allows such computations? My attempt, falls short. Let $E_l$ be the event of picking an ordered sequence of length $l$. Let $c_l$ be the last integer chosen. $\mathrm{p(E_{l+1} | E_l)} = \mathrm{p(E_l)}\mathrm{p(\mathbb{1}_{n>c})}$ $\mathrm{p(\mathbb{1}_{n>c})} = 1- \frac{c_l}{|N|}$ $\mathrm{p(E_{l+1} | E_l)} = \mathrm{p(E_l)} - \frac{c_l\mathrm{p(E_l)}}{|N|}$ As the $c_l$ is unknown, I am unable to solve the recurrence. Should I treat it like a random variable as well (similar to how the variance is taken as a random variable in $T$ distribution)? Example: Let $N\subset\mathbb{N}$, and the sequence chosen at random (with repetition) is $S=\{3,2,4,2,4,3,4,5\}$ S contains two ordered sub-sequences, namely $sS_1=\{2,4\}$ , $sS_2=\{2,4\}$, $sS_3=\{3,4,5\}$ The number of ordered sub-sequences is three.

1713711,Derivatives problem - what am I doing wrong?,"The problem: A shuttle lifts off vertically from a point $4$ miles from the command post.  For the first $20$ seconds of flight, its angle of elevation changes at a constant rate of $3$ degrees per second.  What is the velocity of the shuttle when the angle of elevation is $30$ degrees? I made a right triangle picture and realized that $\tan \theta = \frac x4$.  This means that $ x=4\tan \theta$ which is the same as $ x=4\tan(3t)$ because $\theta=3t$ if the angle is changing at $3$ degrees per second. The velocity will be $\frac {dx}{dt}$ so differentiating the equation gives $\frac {dx}{dt}=12\sec^2 (3t)$. Substituting back gives me $\frac {dx}{dt}=12\sec^2\theta$. Finally, the problem asks for the velocity when the angle of elevation is $30$ degrees, which is $\frac \pi 6$, so evaluating my derivative gives $12\sec^2 \frac \pi 6$ which is $16$.

Here is the problem 1-8 in Lee's introduction to smooth manifolds: An angle function on a subset $U \subset S^1$ is a continuous
    function $ \theta: U\to \mathbb R$ such that $e^{i\theta(z)}=z$ for all $z \in U$. Show that there exists an angle function on an open subset $U\subset S^1$ if and only if $U \neq S^1.$ For any such  angle function, show that $(U,\theta)$ is a smooth coordinate chart for $S^1$ with its standard smooth structure. I wonder if $U\ne S^1$ is sufficient for the existence of such a continuous angle function(I feel that the statement should be "" there exists an angle function on an open subset $U\subset S^1$ if and only if $U$ is not dense in $S^1.$ ""). Let's take a special case when $U=S^1-\{-1\}$. Suppose there is such a continuous angle function $ \theta: U\to \mathbb R$ such that $e^{i\theta(z)}=z$ for all $z \in U$. Then we must have $\theta(z)=arg(z)+2k\pi$. However, It seems that there will always be a ""jump"" somewhere on the circle making $\theta$ discontinuous. For example, if we define $\theta(z)=\arg(z)$, then when $z$ approaches $-1$ from the first quadrant and the four quadrant separately, $\theta(z)$ approaches to $\pi$ or $-\pi$.(This argument turns out to be wrong , see the answers and comments given below by repliers) Since professor Lee doesn't make any corrections to this problem, it should be correct as given.
