432128,Yet Another Monty Hall Question - Please advise if alternative scenario proves the same principle,"Okay, I'm very embarrassed that there are already 71 questions (based on search of ""monty hall"") and I'm going to post another one. I read the first 5 before succumbing to choice-overload. I'll try to keep this short and sweet. A host and contestant stand before 3 doors. The host advises the contestant that behind 1 of the 3 is a car while the other doors each have a goat. The host advises the contestant to choose 2 of the 3 doors to reveal if either has the car. The contestant chooses door 1 and door 3 . The host advises that behind one of the doors chosen is a goat and asks if the contestant wants to keep doors 1 and 3 or switch to only revealing door 2 . Big Question : Is the probability of revealing the car higher if the contestant switches or stays with the original choice? As I understand the original problem, the above has the same result, so the contestant should switch, but I can't wrap my head around the math and don't want to hurt my brain trying if I'm incorrect about the above fundamentally being the same scenario. Also, if the above is the same, how is it any different from the contestant saying ""3, no wait 2"", since no matter which 2 doors are chosen (either by the contestant alone or with the help of the host, as in the original problem), we know that at least 1 door has a goat? Last bit: If this is the same mathematical scenario, is it even less intuitive than the original or does it help clarify (to someone other than me) why the original works? Addendum Original MH problem, simplified: There are 3 marbles in a bag; 2 are boring and grey, 1 is green.  The host asks you to reach in and pull 1 out but not look at it.  After doing this, the host, who can look into the bag, pulls out 1 grey marble. He then asks if you want to keep the 1 in your clutched hand or take the 1 still in the bag. My version, simplified: There are 3 marbles in a bag; 2 are boring and grey, 1 is green.  The host asks you to reach in and pull 2 out but not look at them.  After doing this, the host asks if you want to keep the 2 in your clutched hand or take the 1 still in the bag. In both scenarios, 2 marbles are removed from the bag and 1 of those 2 is definitely grey. If we accept (and we all should at this point!) that in the first scenario the probability of the remaining door or marble being the winning choice is 2/3, shouldn't that hold true in the second scenario? If not, please explain at what point it diverges? If we know 1 of the 2   ""out of the bag"" is grey or a goat in either scenario, it shouldn't matter if we see which of the 2 it is, right? Addendum 2 Thanks to Eric T for helping me get my head around this. With either of my modified scenarios, where my logic diverged was I allow the contestant to choose 2 doors and then keep both choices or switch, whereas in the original MH problem, the contestant is given a second ""choice"" with the host-reveal but still only keeps the original (or switches). One of my goals in creating this alternative was to eliminate the host variable which is a clear source of confusion (and trickery) in the original, leading to such misassumptions as The host's knowledge of what is behind all three doors creates a mathematical bias since he won't ever choose the car at random. If MH only presents the option when the car wasn't selected (to throw the contestant off), this would not change the math when testing for when the contestant chooses the car first. If the host always chooses a goat, it's because he always has at least one goat to choose from and is supposed to reveal a goat, not choose a door at random. Showing the contestant that one of the other 2 doors has a goat gives the contestant new information that affects the outcome. it is not eliminating the goat (seeing the goat) that makes switching more likely to reveal the car, it is eliminating the door. If my variation has the  pick-2 parameter but has the ""only one door allowed"" rule reinstated , switching is still the better option. Here is the final version: A host and contestant stand before 3 doors. The host advises the contestant that 1 of the 3 doors hides a car while the other doors each hide a goat. The host advises the contestant to choose 2 of the 3 doors to check for the car. The contestant chooses door 1 and door 3 . The host asks the contestant to choose between opening 1 and 3 or switch to opening door 2 . In this scenario, the host has done nothing to interfere and the contestant knows that at least one of the two selected doors has a goat, but must still risk choosing the wrong door of his selected 2 or switching.  While the odds may still seem 1/2 at first, the possibility that the contestant chose both goats and thus may have no chance with his current subset makes the better odds in switching clearer. Last question: What would be the actual probability of choosing the car if we don't know if the car exists in the subset 1 or 0 times? Just a comment mentioning a concept or wiki page is fine. Just curious on the math and have no idea what search for.","['monty-hall', 'intuition', 'probability']"

  and then show that the nonreduced points of $X$ are precisely the closed points corresponding to positive integers and that the complement of this set is not Zariski open. Attempt: First let's consider $$X':=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb C[x,y_1, y_2,\ldots]/(y_1^2, y_2^2, \ldots))$$ Because we are modding out $\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb C[x,y_1, y_2, \ldots])$ by the ideals $(y_i^2)$, we get $\mathbb A^1$ with a fuzz that is the intersection of the fuzz of each one of the $(y_i^2)$. This intersection is parallelepiped around the $x$-axis. So we see that we get a map $X' \to \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb C[x])$, which implies that we also have $X \to \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb C[x])$. Now we look at what happens when we further mod out by $((x-i)y_i)$. These ideals are a cross of hyperplanes $x = i$ with $y_i = 0$. They surely add some fuzz at the integer points, but I can't really visualize it. Algebraically, they are adding 1-order differential information, since now we can consider a Taylor expansion around $(i, 0_1, 0_2,\ldots y_i, 0_{i+1}, \ldots)$ up to terms $a_0 + a_xx + a_yy$.",['algebraic-geometry']

432217,Homotopy invariance of the Picard group,"Is the Picard group of a scheme homotopy invariant in the sense that the projection $\pi : X \times \mathbb{A}^1 \to X$ induces an isomorphism $\mathrm{Pic}(X) \cong \mathrm{Pic}(X \times \mathbb{A}^1)$? Clearly it induces a split monomorphism, and it is an isomorphism iff the two sections $i_0,i_1 : X \to X \times \mathbb{A}^1$ induce the same homomorphism on Picard groups, i.e. $i_0^* \mathcal{L} \cong i_1^* \mathcal{L}$ for every line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on $X \times \mathbb{A}^1$. There are various special cases where this is true: 1) When $X$ is noetherian, separated, integral and locally factorial, it follows from Prop. 6.6 (homotopy invariance of the class group à la Weil) and Corollary 6.16 (isomorphism between the class group and the Picard group) in Hartshorne's book. I wonder if there is a more direct proof which doesn't take the detour with Weil divisors, but this is not my main question here. 2) It is also true when $X$ is affine and factorial (not necessarily noetherian), since one can check directly that the Picard group of a factorial domain vanishes. It then also follows when $X$ is covered by affine factorial schemes. 3) If $X$ is integral projective over an algebraically closed field  with $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X)=0$, it is a special case of Ex. III.12.6 in Hartshorne's book. Perhaps someone can indicate a proof? What about more general assumptions? What about integral schemes in general (then we can work with Cartier divisors)? Or does it even hold in general? Remark that I don't want to make any detour with class groups! If not, I would like to know specific examples for $X$ such that $\mathrm{Pic}(X \times \mathbb{A}^1) \not\cong \mathrm{Pic}(X)$.",['algebraic-geometry']

432227,Group of order $p^2$ is abelian. [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Showing group with $p^2$ elements is Abelian (12 answers) Closed 11 years ago . The community reviewed whether to reopen this question 10 months ago and left it closed: Original close reason(s) were not resolved Yes, I know that there are tons of solutions of this up here, but I, essentially, wanted to try it a different way and ah, well. Let $|G| = p^2$ for some prime $p$. Consider $x \in G$.
So, $|x| = p, $ or $ p^2$.
If it is the latter, then, we are done. So, if $|x|= p$, then, let, $H = [h|  h=x^i, i \in Z] \Rightarrow |H|= p$. As $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $|G|$, $H$ is a normal subgroup. Now, consider some $y \in G$, but not in $H \Rightarrow y^p= e$.
Then, its easy to show that $G = \langle x,y \rangle$. Now, consider a homomorphism $f:G \rightarrow \operatorname{Aut}(H), g \to c_g $, wherein $c_g$ represents conjugacy by $g$. So, for example, $c_g(x) = gx g^{-1}$. Then, it is clear that, $H \subset \operatorname{Ker}(f) $, as it is cyclic and therefore abelian.
So, we need only look at $G/H$. Basically, I am asking for a hint as to why $c_y(x) = yxy^{-1} = x = c_e(x)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the generators of $H$ and $G/H$, respectively? Because, if I establish it for the generators, then it follows that it applies for for all elements, i.e, that $\operatorname{Im}(f)$ is trivial and therefore that $G$ is abelian.

Hence $P(A\cap B \cap C) \leq P(A\cap B) = 0.4$, by axioms 3 and 2, since $P(A\cap B \cap C^c)\geq 0$. By making a Venn-diagram I figured out that the lower boundary should probably be $0.25$, as this is $0.4+0.5+0.6-1=0.5$ (which is everything that should be in some intersection because the total probability cannot be greater than one) devided by $2$ (because the $0.5$ can be split over two intersections). However, I am not sure how to show this using the axioms provided. Could anyone please help? (b) I think I will need the result from a. I am however not at all sure yet what I should do to solve this question. Any help would be appreciated.","['statistics', 'probability']"

Define $A = \left\{n\in \Bbb N : (\forall s\in S)(n \leq s)\right\}$ . It is obvious that $1\in A$ . Suppose $n\in A$ , then for each $s \in S$ , there exists $q \in N$ such that $n + q = s$ . Since $q \ge 1$ , $n+1 \leq s$ , for all $s\in S$ .
By Principle of mathematical induction, $A = \Bbb N$ .

432392,Triple Integral over a shifted sphere,"I am interested in the following: Let $f(x,y,z)$ be a given (known) function in Cartesian coordinates, and let $B_d(p_0) = \{ y: ||y-p_0|| < d \}$ (i.e., a sphere centered at p_0). I want to numerically compute in MATLAB $$\int \int \int_{B_d(p_0)} f(x,y,z) dx dy dz$$ Now, I remember that if $p_0 = 0$, this isn't too bad: I just change to spherical coordinates and compute $$\int_0^{2 \pi} \int_0^{\pi} \int_0^d f(r,\theta,\phi) r^2 \sin(\theta) dr d\theta d \phi$$ where $\theta$ is my polar angle (from the positive z-axis down) and $\phi$ is my azimuthal angle (from the positive x-axis in the x-y  plane). In this form, this is just an integral over a cube , and I can just call integral3 on this, with my integrand being $f(r,\theta,\phi) r^2 \sin(\theta)$. But, if I have a circle centered elsewhere, it seems a bit trickier. I thought I could shift variables as such: Let $p_0 = (x_0,y_0,z_0)$. Then, set $x' = x-x_0, y' = y-y_0, z' = z-z_0$. I believe that this linear shift won't affect the integration, so now I have $$\int \int \int_{B_d(0)} f(x',y',z') dx' dy' dz'$$
This I can now switch to polar coordinates as $$\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \int_0^d f(r',\theta',\phi') r'^2 \sin(\theta') dr d\theta' d\phi'$$. with $r' = x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2$, $\theta' = arccos(\frac{z'}{r'})$, $\phi' = arctan\frac{y'}{x'})$. 
I guess I'm worried about how to actually input this; there has to be some additional shifting or changing going on, because if I just tell MATLAB to integrate $f(r',\theta',\phi')$, over a sphere of radius 0, it looks to me like it would be no different than integrating over $(r,\theta,\phi)$ without the shift. Is there some change to the Jacobian or something I need to do to reflect this shift of variables to this shifted polar coordinate system? Would I first define a function $f(x,y,z)$, then define a new shifted function $g(x',y',z') = f(x,y,z)$, then spherical coordinate $g$? For example, let's say we want to integrate $f(x,y,z) = \sin(x) \sin(y) \sin(z)$ over a ball of radius 1 centered at (2,3,4). First, I can define $x' = x-2, y' = y-3, z' = z-4$, and I have $f(x',y',z') = \sin(x'+2) \sin(y'+3) \sin(z'+4)$. Then, I can define my spherical coordinate system, and I replace $x' = r' \sin(\theta') \cos(\phi'), y' = r' \sin(\theta') \sin(\phi')$ and $z' = r' \cos(\theta')$. This leads to the final integrand being (including the Jacboian from the spherical coordinate change) $$F(r',\theta',\phi') = \sin(r'\sin(\theta')\cos(\phi')+2) \sin(r' \sin(\theta') \sin(\phi')+3) \sin(r' \cos(\theta')+4) r'^2 \sin(\theta')$$ This function i can then apply a Matlab routine like integral3 over $0\leq r' \leq 1$, $0 \leq \theta' \leq \pi$ and $0 \leq \phi' \leq 2\pi$. Does this sound correct? Thanks!","['multivariable-calculus', 'integration', 'spherical-coordinates']"
432413,Purely inseparable extension of algebraic function field,"Let $K$ be a field with $\operatorname{char}(K) = p > 0$ and with the property that $[K:K^p] < \infty$.
Let $F/K$ be an algebraic function field, i.e there is an element $x \in F$ which is transcendental over $K$ and $F/K(x)$ is a finite field extension. Assume that $F/K(x)$ is separable. It can be shown that $F/F^{p^n}$ is a finite, purely inseparable field extension with $[F:F^{p^n}] \geq p^n$. If $K$ is perfect, then $[F:F^{p^n}] = p^n$. When $K$ is not perfect, one can consider $F' := F^{p^n} K$. Using the fact that $F/K$ is separably generated, one can prove that $[F:F'] \leq p^n$. But do we have $[F:F'] = p^n$? Update: I may have a way to prove it, but I need to know if there is a mistake. Since $F/K(x)$ is separable by the assumption, we can write $F = K(x, y)$. Consider the subfield $K(x, y^{p^n})$ of $F$. It contains $K(x)$, hence $F/K(x, y^{p^n})$ is separable. On the other hand, it is easy to see that $F/K(x, y^{p^n})$ is purely inseparable (of degree $\leq p^n$). Hence $F = K(x, y^{p^n})$. Now $F^{p^n} = K^{p^n}(x^{p^n}, y^{p^n})$ and $F' = F^{p^n}K = K(x^{p^n}, y^{p^n})$.
We have $$[F:F'] = \frac{[F:K(x^{p^n})]}  {[F': K(x^{p^n})]} = \frac{[F:K(x)] \cdot [K(x) : K(x^{p^n})]} {[F': K(x^{p^n})]} = \frac{[F:K(x)] \cdot p^n} {[F': K(x^{p^n})]} = \frac{[K(x, y^{p^n}):K(x)] \cdot p^n} {[K(x^{p^n}, y^{p^n}): K(x^{p^n})]} \cdot$$ 
In order to see $[F:F'] = p^n$, we only need to show $[K(x, y^{p^n}):K(x)] \geq [K(x^{p^n}, y^{p^n}): K(x^{p^n})]$, because it is easy to see $[F:F'] = [K(x, y^{p^n}) :K(x^{p^n}, y^{p^n})] \leq p^n$. Now let $f(T) = \sum_{i=0}^n f_i(x)T^i \in K(x)[T] $ be the minimal polynomial of $y$ over $K(x)$. Then $f(y) = \sum_{i=0}^n f_i(x)y^i = 0$. Hence $\sum_{i=0}^n \tilde{f_i}(x^{p^n})(y^{p^n})^i = 0$, here $\tilde{f_i}$'s are obtained from $f_i$'s by raising their coefficients to the $p^n$ power. This shows that $[K(x^{p^n}, y^{p^n}): K(x^{p^n})] \leq n = [K(x, y):K(x)] = [K(x, y^{p^n}):K(x)]$ and the proof is done.","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
432415,Structure theorem for finitely generated commutative $semi$groups.,"$\newcommand{\ZZ}{\mathbb{Z}}$ 
It is a classical theorem that a finitely generated commutative group is isomorphic to one of the form:
$$ \ZZ^n \oplus \ZZ/{m_1}\ZZ \oplus \ZZ/{m_2}\ZZ \oplus \dots \oplus \ZZ/{m_r}\ZZ.$$
In other words, one can construct any finitely generated commutative group out of the ""building blocks'' $\ZZ$ and $\ZZ/{m}\ZZ$ for $m = 2,3,4,\dots$. I have been wondering: is there a similar structure theorem for semigroups? I am hoping for a result which says something in the spirit of: ""There are the following semigroups $(S_i)_{i \in I}$, such that if $S$ is a finitely generated commutative semigroup, then $S \simeq S_{i_1} \oplus S_{i_2} \oplus \dots \oplus S_{i_r}$''. Surely, for semigroups one needs to allow for more general ""building blocks'' than for groups. Also, a simple example of the semigroup $\mathbb{N}_2 := \{2,3,4,\dots\}$ shows that the basic semigroups won't be generated by just a single element. However, I am hoping that there might exist a managable list of semigroups which will suffice.","['semigroups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

432476,Laplacian on Sphere of Function Only Depending on Angle Between Points,"Consider a function $f:S^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ , with $S^2$ the unit $2$-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Let's say that $f$ depends only on the polar angle $\theta$ from the north pole (e.g., $f(r,\theta,\phi) = e^{\cos(\theta)} $ which is also just $e^z$ in Cartesian cordinates). Now, we define the Laplacian on the sphere by $$\Delta f = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \sin(\theta) \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} + \frac{1}{\sin^2(\theta)} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2}$$ where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle in the $xy$ plane. Now, another way of looking at $f$ is saying that its value at $p \in S^2$ depends on the norm distance between the point $p_0 = (0,0,1)$ and $p$, since $||p-p_0|| = \sqrt{||p||^2 -2(p,p_0) + ||p_0||^2} = \sqrt{2-2 \cos(\theta)}$, where we just used the statement $a \cdot b = |a| |b| \cos(\theta)$. Hence, we can view $f$ as a function depending on the distance from $p$ to $p_0$. From here on, consider a chosen function $f$  whose form we know, and whose value at a point $p$  depends only on the cosine of the angle between a fixed chosen point $p_0$ (the north pole) and $p$. With this, we can then compute $\Delta f$, and we note that all of the $\phi$ terms are automatically zero, so $\Delta f$ can be computed completely in terms of the $\theta$ derivatives. Recall that we saw that $f$ depends on ly on $\theta$, or equivalently, $f$ depends only on $||p-p_0||$, that is $f(p) = f(||p-p_0||)$. This gives rise to many different ""rotated"" versions of $f$ if I move $p_0$ from the north pole to somewhere else. I want to investigate the following question: How can we take the Laplacian of $f$ if we vary $p_0$? Does it have a simple form and how does it related to the Laplacian of $f(||p-p_0||)$ when $p_0$ is the north pole? So, let's consider this ""rotated"" version of $f$. That is, consider a point $p_0$ besides $(0,0,1)$ such as maybe $(1,0,0)$. Now, instead of depending on the angle between $p$ and the north pole, it depends on the angle $\theta'$ between $p$ and this shifted point $p_0$. In some sense, we are essentially rotating the sphere and assigning this new $p_0$ to be the north pole. Here is what I want to do: I want to compuate $\Delta f$ for this new shifted $f$ where $f$ depends on this new $\theta'$. I have been told that I can just do the following: since $f(\theta')$ depends only on the polar distance, the Laplacian of $f$ is the same as taking the orignal $f$ with $p_0$ being the north pole, taking the Laplacian of that function (which only depends on $\theta$), which yields some function $g(\theta) = \Delta f$. Now, if I use a different point $p_0$ than the north pole, the claim is that $\Delta f(||p-p_0||) = g(\theta')$. That is, its the same function, just with a swap of the variable from $\theta$ to $\theta'$. Therefore, to compute $\Delta f(||p-p_0||)$ for any different $p_0$, it suffices to compute the simple case of $\Delta f(\theta)$ by $$ g(\theta) = \Delta f(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)} \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta} \sin(\theta) \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}$$
and then swapping that $\theta$ with the different $\theta'$ depending on the new $p_0$.
That seems reasonable to me, but I'm just worried that it looks like on a rotated version of the function, the azimuthal derivatives will impact it. Certainly if I view things in terms of $\theta$ and $\phi$, there will be $\phi$ components. The assertion I suppose is that in this rotated setting, $\Delta f(\theta')$ still depends only on $\theta'$ and has the same form as $\Delta f(\theta)$ as if it were centered at the north pole. Is this true? I apologize if this is confusing or trivial!","['multivariable-calculus', 'spherical-geometry', 'spherical-coordinates']"

432771,Continued fraction for $\tan(nx)$,"I found this beautiful continued fraction expansion of $\tan(nx)$ , $n$ being a positive integer, online but I don't remember the source now: $\displaystyle \tan(nx) = \cfrac{n\tan x}{1 -\cfrac{(n^{2} - 1^{2})\tan^{2}x}{3 -\cfrac{(n^{2} - 2^{2})\tan^{2}x}{5 -\cfrac{(n^{2} - 3^{2})\tan^{2}x}{7 -\cdots}}}}$ the last term in the continued fraction being $\dfrac{(n^{2} - (n - 1)^{2})\tan^{2}x}{(2n - 1)} = \tan^{2}x$ . For example for $n = 3$ we have $\displaystyle \tan 3x = \cfrac{3\tan x}{1 -\cfrac{8\tan^{2}x}{3-\cfrac{5\tan^{2}x}{5}}}$ which is correct and can be verified easily. I would like to know a simple proof via elementary trigonometry and algebra. I had asked this question long back on NRICH( https://nrich.maths.org/discus/messages/153904/145455.html ) but did not get any helpful answer. The reason I wish to know the proof is that it will lead me to an elementary proof of continued fraction expansion of $\tan z$ . Putting $nx = z$ where $z$ is kept constant and $n$ is made to tend to $\infty$ (so that $x \to 0$ ) we get $\displaystyle \tan z = \cfrac{z}{1-\cfrac{z^{2}}{3 -\cfrac{z^{2}}{5-\cfrac{z^{2}}{7-\cdots}}}}$ instead of the complicated proof by Lambert given in my blog http://paramanands.blogspot.com/2011/04/continued-fraction-expansion-of-tanx.html I have got another formula from an exercise in ""A Course of Pure Mathematics"" by G. H. Hardy : $$\cos nx = 1 - \frac{n^{2}}{2!}\sin^{2}x - \frac{n^{2}(2^{2} - n^{2})}{4!}\sin^{4}x - \frac{n^{2}(2^{2} - n^{2})(4^{2} - n^{2})}{6!}\sin^{6}x - \cdots$$ I will try to find out if this formula can be used to prove the continued fraction expansion of $\tan(nx)$ . Update : This question was originally posed by Euler in 1813. See Chrystal's Algebra Vol 2 (page 526, problem 31). Further Update : The following approach looks promising but I don't know how to complete it. We have $\tan nx=A/B$ where $$A=\binom{n} {1}\tan x-\binom{n}{3}\tan ^3x+\dots$$ and $$B=\binom{n} {0}-\binom{n}{2}\tan ^2x+\dots$$ and thus $$\frac{\tan nx} {n\tan x} =\frac{C} {B} =\dfrac{1}{1+\dfrac{B-C}{C}}$$ where $$C=1-\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}\tan^2x+\dots$$ Next $$B-C=-\frac{n^2-1^2}{1!3}\tan^2x+\frac{(n^2-1^2)(n-2)(n-3)}{3!5}\tan^4x-\dots$$ and this can be rewritten as $$-\frac{n^2-1^2}{3}\tan^2x\left(1-\frac{(n-2)(n-3)}{2!5}\tan^2x+\dots\right)$$ If the expression in large parentheses above is $D$ then we have $$\frac{\tan nx} {n\tan x} =\dfrac{1}{1-\dfrac{(n^2-1^2) \tan^2x}{3+\dfrac{3C-3D}{D}}}$$ The problem now is to put $B, C, D$ into a common pattern so that we can easily get the next expressions like $E, F, \dots$ .

That is, an associative bilinear operation $* : A^2 \to A$  with an identity $1_A \in A$. A possible follow-up question would be conditions for a nontrivial rng structure on $A$ (indeed, the multiplication $ab = 0$ always gives a rng structure). For example, if $A$ is finitely generated, then by the structure theorem on finite type abelian groups, $A \simeq \mathbb Z^r \times \prod \mathbb Z/p_i^{a_i} \mathbb Z$ and it has a product ring structure. On the other hand, $\mathbb Q / \mathbb Z$ doesn't: if it did, the unit $u=[p/q]$ would have finite order $q$, and $\forall x \in \mathbb Q / \mathbb Z, qx = q(u*x) = (qu)*x = 0$, but $q(1/2q) = 1/2 \neq 0$. More generally, by this question , if every element has finite order but the orders are not bounded, then there is no ring structure on $A$. Is this condition also necessary? I doubt it: I have trouble envisioning a ring structure on $(\mathbb R / \mathbb Z, +) = (S^1, \cdot)$, but not every element has finite order in $S^1$. The argument also completely fails for rngs.

432867,Learning Complex Analysis: Integrals vs. Power Series - ordering the development of results.,"Over the last few months, I have been visiting elementary complex analysis. My exposure to complex analysis is pretty much limited to the material in three books: Ahlfors, Bak/Newman, and Churchill/Brown. I don't care much for Churchill/Brown, but really enjoy the other two. Both Ahlfors and Bak/Newman open up the rabbit hole by proving the Cauchy Integral Theorem for functions analytic on a rectangle, and then for functions analytic on a rectangle except for (ostensibly) a finite set of points. They both then show the Cauchy formula representing the function as a contour integral on a circle. After that, things begin to diverge. Bak/Newman develops the power series representation for analytic functions, and uses this to show analytic functions are infinitely differentiable. From this he gets Morera's theorem, the Uniqueness theorem, etc. Ahlfors instead proceeds to differentiate the Cauchy formula under the integral to show an analytic function is infinitely differentiable, to get Morera's theorem, the Uniqueness theorem, etc., without really mentioning power series. He leaves power series to (slightly) later development. (One thing I like about Ahlfors' approach is that, as far as I can tell, you can derive the differentiability of power series inside their radius of convergence without using the same kind of $\delta - \epsilon$ arguments that Bak/Newman uses.) My question is this: Is there a general feeling about whether or not one approach is better than the other in terms of any/all of the following criteria: Beauty; Ease of instruction; Deeper understanding of the subject; Usefulness in applications; (Other criteria)?

And for continuity I have to approach $(0,0)^t$ however I want to which I don't do using polar coordinates. So why can I still use polar coordinates? Thanks for helping. Add: I don't want a solution for the continuity of the example above.

However, in the book I was reading, it said (and I paraphrase) ""It's not difficult to show it is a norm on the space of integrable random variables and for which $\|X\|_{\psi}$ is finite"". So I decided to prove this. To recap, if $\psi$ is a monotone nondecreasing, convex function with $\psi(0) = 0$, the Orlicz norm of an integrable random variable X wrt $\psi$ is given by $$\|X\|_{\psi} = \inf \left\{u>0: \mathbb{E}\left[\psi\left(\frac{|X|}{u}\right) \right] \leq 1\right\}$$ Here is what I got so far: 1) $\|aX\|_{\psi} = |a|\|X\|_{\psi} \quad \forall a \in \mathbb{R}$ $$ \|aX\|_{\psi} = \inf \left\{u>0: \mathbb{E}\left[\psi\left(\frac{|aX|}{u}\right) \right] \leq 1\right\}$$ Replace $u$ with $|a|v$
$$ = \inf \left\{|a|v>0: \mathbb{E}\left[\psi\left(\frac{|X|}{v}\right) \right] \leq 1\right\}$$
$$ = |a|\inf \left\{v>0: \mathbb{E}\left[\psi\left(\frac{|X|}{v}\right) \right] \leq 1\right\}$$
$$ = |a|\|X\|_{\psi}$$ 2) $\|X\|_{\psi} = 0 \iff X = 0 \quad a.e$ ($\Leftarrow$) This directly follows from substitution. You will however have to split the expectation into two parts, one where $X=0$ and the other where it isn't. But I got it nonetheless. Now for ($\Rightarrow$). If $\|X\|_{\psi} = 0$, then $\forall u > 0$,
$$ \mathbb{E}\left[\psi\left(\frac{|X|}{u}\right) \right] \leq 1$$ Now suppose, the implication were false, then let $A = \left\{\omega \subset \Omega  : X(\omega) \neq 0\right\}$. Now by Jensen's Inequality, 
$$\psi \left[\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{|X|1_A}{u}\right) \right] \leq \mathbb{E}\left[\psi\left(\frac{|X1_A|}{u}\right) \right]$$ Now unless I assume that $\psi$ is unbounded, I don't know how to proceed. Incidentally, in the book, the $\psi$ they use are all unbounded. If it is unbounded, then for a sufficiently small $u$, I can ""cross"" 1, which will be a desired contradiction. So I need help for the bounded case. 3) Triangle inequality I tried several convexity tricks, but I didn't get this. Essentially, we have to show
$$\|X+Y\|_{\psi} \leq \|X\|_{\psi} +\|Y\|_{\psi}$$
Perhaps there is a trick I haven't tried... Anyway I would appreciate any hints, tips and answers for the parts I didn't get. Thanks for your time.","['probability-theory', 'convex-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

433140,"A ring with no non-zero nilpotents and $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ for all $a,b$ must be commutative","Given that $R$ is a ring with no non-zero nilpotent elements and has $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ for all $a,b\in R$, show that $R$ is commutative. I have previously shown that, if $R$ is unital and has $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ for all $a,b\in R$, then $R$ is commutative. This allows me to restrict attention to non-unital $R$, but I haven't been able to get anywhere with that ""simplification"". The proof in the unital case makes explicit use of the unit element, and it does not seem to suggest anything for this new case. Some of the things I've tried: various element manipulations; looking for some sort of recurrence between powers of a commutator $ab-ba$; studying the set $S=\{(ab-ba)^k\mid k\in\mathbb{N}\}$. This is from Herstein's Topics in Algebra, second edition, problem #25 in the supplementary problems of chapter 3. Any hints would be appreciated. Edit: proof in the unital case If $R$ is unital, evaluate $[a(1+b)]^2$ in two different ways, using the stipulation of the problem, to find $a^2b=aba$. Similarly, $[(1+a)b]^2$ gives $ab^2=bab$. Finally, evaluating $[(1+a)(1+b)]^2$ in two different ways, and canceling terms using those two relations, we end up with $ab=ba$.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
433181,Puzzle in Percentages,"Okay, this is a real-time problem. The following is a picture of Customer satisfaction rating, which was displayed next to an item in an online shopping website. Satisfied customers click the vote-up button, and unsatisfied customers click the vote-down button. Every time a button is clicked, the rating changes accordingly. From the above image, we can infer that 94% of the people are satisfied with the product and the rest 6% aren't satisfied. Now, is there any way to find out the number of people who participated in voting? Edit: It's clear that there could be infinite solutions evident from Lord Soth's answer. So, I'll change the question a bit. What could be the minimum no of people who participated in voting??","['average', 'puzzle', 'linear-algebra', 'probability']"
433193,Is there a 0-1 law for the theory of groups?,"For each first order sentence $\phi$ in the language of groups, define : $$p_N(\phi)=\frac{\text{number of nonisomorphic groups $G$ of order} \le N\text{ such that } \phi \text{ is valid in } G}{\text{number of nonisomorphic groups of order} \le N}$$ Thus, $p_N(\phi)$ can be regarded as the probability that $\phi$ is valid in a randomly chosen group of order $\le N$. Now define $$p(\phi)=\lim_{N \to \infty}p_N(\phi)$$
if this limit exists. We say that the theory of groups fulfills a first order zero-one law if for every sentence $\phi$, $p(\phi)$ exists and equals either $0$ or $1$. I'm asking myself whether this 0-1 law holds indeed in group theory. Since it is conjectured that ""almost every group is a 2-group"", statements like $\exists x: x\ne 1 \wedge x^2=1 \wedge \forall y:xy=yx$ (meaning $2|Z(G)$) or $\forall x: x^3=1 \to x=1$ (no element has order 3) should have probability $1$ and I don't see any possibility to construct any sentence with $p\not \in \{0,1\}$. Am I missing an obvious counterexample, or can you show (under the condition that almost every group is indeed a 2-group) that the theory of finite groups fulfills this 0-1 law?","['model-theory', 'logic', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'first-order-logic']"
433197,"Trying to find more information about ""Darboux's method/theorem"" on coefficients of an analytic function","My supervisor briefly showed me a statement of something she called ""Darboux's theorem,"" but I am having trouble finding more information about it on the internet. Here is what I have written down (some details may be incorrect): Let function $R$ be analytic in a neighborhood about $z=0$ of radius $\rho$. Suppose it has exactly one singularity at distance $\rho$ from $z=0$ (not sure about this sentence). If $R$
 can be written in the form
$$R(z) = \left(1-\frac zp\right)^{-s} G(z) + H(z)$$
where $s \notin \{0, -1, -2,\ldots\}$, where $G$ and $H$ are analytic in neighborhoods about $z=0$ of radius larger than $\rho$, and $G(\rho)\ne 0$, then the coefficient of $z^n$ in the power expansion of $R(z)$ follows this asymptotic description
$$[z^n] R(z) = \rho^{-n} n^{s-1} \frac{G(s)}{\Gamma(s)} \left(1 + O\left(\frac 1n\right)\right)$$ My guess is that it's called ""Darboux's method"" in English, but still I only have these two links ( here and here ), that don't have a statement that is exactly the above, although they seem close. Can anyone comment or help me find what I'm looking for?

433214,differential equation with parameter,"I've got problem with such an example: Given equation $\frac{dx}{dt} = -x + x^7$ with initial condition $x(0) = \lambda$, where $x=x(t, \lambda)$. Find $\frac{ \partial x(t, \lambda)}{\partial \lambda} \mid _{\lambda = 0}$. What I've got now is: We can write: $x(t, \lambda) = \int_{0}^{t} -x + x^7 ds + C(t,\lambda)$ but since $x(0) = \lambda$, we've got $\lambda = x(0, \lambda) = \int_{0}^{0} -x + x^7 ds + C(0,\lambda) = C(0, \lambda)$ and so 
$x(t, \lambda) = \lambda + \int_{0}^{t} -x + x^7 ds$ Now we can apply $\frac{ \partial }{\partial \lambda}$ to both sides getting:
$\frac{ \partial x(t, \lambda)}{\partial \lambda} = 1 + \int_{0}^{t}{ \frac{ \partial}{\partial \lambda}(-x(t, \lambda)) + \frac{ \partial}{\partial \lambda}(x(t, \lambda)^7) }ds$.

$$-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2}E}{\partial u_{1}\partial u_{2}}(0,0) = \sum_{t\in[0,1]} \langle W_{2},\Delta_t\frac{DW_{1}}{dt} \rangle +\int^{1}_{0} \langle W_{2},\frac{D^{2}W_{1}}{dt^{2}} + R(V,W_{1})V \rangle dt $$

We can define a Jacobi field along a geodesic $\gamma$ as the field that satisfies the differential equation
$$   \frac{D^{2}J}{dt^{2}} + R(V,J)V = 0 $$
that is the equation in the integral in the second variation formula. Is there a method to introduce Jacobi fields using the second variation formula? Does it happen that when a geodesic is not minimal, the form isn't defined?","['geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
433280,"Proving $g(\omega)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma}\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)-\omega}\, dz$ where $g$ is the inverse of $f$","I have the following exercise: Let $G$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{C}$ and let $f$ be a one to one
  function in $H(G)$ such that $f'(z)\neq0$ for all $z\in G$. For each $\omega\in f(G)$ let $g(\omega)$ denote the unique complex
  number $z\in G$ for which $f(z)=\omega$. Suppose that the closed disk $\overline{D(z_{o},r)}\subseteq G$ and
  that $\gamma:[0,2\pi]\to G$ is the curve given by
  $\gamma(t)=z_{0}+re^{it}$. Prove, with the help of the residue theorem, that, for every
  $\omega\in f(D(z_{0},r))$ $$g(\omega)=\frac{1}{2\pi
 i}\int_{\gamma}\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)-\omega}\, dz$$ Your solution should also explain why this integral is well defined. I will divide my question into two parts: I have a solution for the case that $g(\omega)\neq0$, but there
is an argument made in it that I can't totally justify: Consider the function  $$ \frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)-\omega} $$ it have the singular point when  $$ f(z)=\omega $$ since $f$ is $1-1$ and $\omega$ is in the image of $f$, there exist a
  unique point $z_{1}$ s.t  $$ f(z_{1})=\omega $$ Since $f'(z)\neq0$ we have it that  $$ h(z):=f(z)-\omega $$ have a zero of order $1$. assume $z_{1}$ maps to $\omega$ $z_{1}f'(z_{1})\neq0$ and $f(z_{1})-\omega=0$, $(f-\omega)'=f'\neq0$
  hence  $$ Res\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)-\omega} $$ at $z=z_{1}$ is  $$ \frac{z_{1}f'(z_{1})}{(f(z)-\omega)'_{z_{1}}}=z_{1}
 $$ and by the residue theorem  $$ \frac{1}{2\pi
 i}\int_{\gamma}\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)-\omega}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}2\pi
 iz_{1}=z_{1}=g(\omega) $$ The part that I can't justify is why $h$ have a zero of order $1$
? I think its because $f$ is $1-1$, but I'm not sure how to use
it 2) I don't think it holds for when $g(\omega)=0$, since then $$z_{1}f'(z_{1})=0\cdot f'(0)=0$$
and so I can't use the theorem I used. Can someone please help me with this case ? Added later: I am referring to the following theorem, that can be found at page
$253$ of the book Complex Variables and Applications by Brown and
Churchill: Let two functions $p,q$ be holomorphic at a point $z_{0}$. If
  $p(z_{0})\neq0,q(z_{0})=0$ and $q'(z_{0})\neq0$ then
  $$Res_{z=z_{0}}\frac{p(z)}{q(z)}=\frac{p(z_{0})}{q'(z_{0})}$$","['residue-calculus', 'complex-analysis']"
