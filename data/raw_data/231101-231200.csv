4802035,What is the asymptotic expansion of the integral $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\tanh{(x^2-a^2)}}{x^2-a^2} dx$ in the limit of large $a$?,"I am trying find the asymptotic form of the following integral for large $a$ $$ I(a) =  \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\tanh{(x^2-a^2)}}{x^2-a^2} dx.$$ Mathematica is unable to numerically integrate it due to the (removable) singularity at $x=\pm a$ . I removed the singularity by changing the limits from $0$ to $\infty$ (even function) and substituting $(x-a) = \pm e^t$ (on either sides of $x=a$ ). Afterwards, mathematica could numerically integrate it. I evaluated the integral for several values of $a$ , and found that the integral has the asymptotic form $I(a) \sim \frac{c_1}{a} + 4 \frac{\log a}{a}$ , where $c_1 \approx 4.41015$ .

4802475,Writing $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ as an inverse limit of finite $T_0$-spaces,"I want to show that $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ can be written as an inverse limit of finite $T_0$ -spaces. First off, $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z} = \{(0), (2),(3),(5),...\}$ , so the closed sets in the Zariski topology are precisely the points $(p)$ with $p \neq 0$ as well as finite unions of these points. Since prime numbers are countable, we could think of $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ as the set $\mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ , where $\{\infty\}$ corresponds to the generic point $(0)$ , and the open sets $A \subseteq \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ are precisely of the form $A= \tilde{A} \cup \{\infty\}$ , where $\tilde{A} \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is open in the cofinite topology, i.e. $\mathbb{N}\setminus \tilde{A}$ is a finite set. My idea now was consider finite spaces $X_i = \{1, ... , i\}$ , with some topology that looks similar to the cofinite topology. We want $\{i\}$ to be the generic point of $X_i$ , so maybe we can define maps $$f_{i,i+1} : X_{i+1} \rightarrow X_i, 1 \mapsto 1, a \mapsto a-1, a \neq 1$$ This way, the generic point $i+1$ of $X_{i+1}$ gets mapped to the generic point $i$ of $X_i$ , and every point gets mapped to a non-generic point. Now, for $i \leq j$ we can easily define maps $f_{i,j}$ by $f_{i,i} = id$ , and $f_{i,j}$ as the compositions of above maps. This defines an inverse system of topological spaces (assumed that these maps are continuous), hence we can consider $$X := \lim_{\leftarrow} X_i = \left\{(x_1, x_2, ...) \in \Pi_{i \in \mathbb{N}} X_i : x_i = f_{i,i+1}(x_{i+1})\right\}$$ We can see that the elements of $X$ are of the form $$X = \{(1,2,3,4,5,...), (1,1,2,3,4, ...), (1,1,1,2,3,4,...), ... , (1,1,1,...)\} \\ 
=\{(x_1, x_2,...) : \exists L \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\} \text{ s.t. } x_k = 1 \text{ }\forall k\leq L, x_k = k+1-L \text{ } \forall k>L\} \\
=: \{A_1, A_2, ... , A_{\infty}\}
$$ This looks somewhat similar to $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ , I would love to just map $A_\infty \mapsto (0)$ , $A_1 \mapsto (2)$ , $A_2 \mapsto (3)$ etc., but we require that this map is continuous as well. The topology on $X$ is given by the product topology, i.e. $U \subseteq X$ is open if it can be written as union of $\Pi_i U_i$ , where the $U_i \subseteq X_i$ are open, and $U_i = f_{i,i+1} (U_{i+1})$ . Now however, I don't know what topology to pick on the $X_i$ . We need the maps $f_{i,j}$ to be continuous, so I thought about picking the following topology on $X_i$ : $A \subseteq X_i$ open iff $A=\tilde{A} \cup \{i\}$ , where $\tilde{A} \subseteq \{1, ... , i-1\}$ . This looks somewhat similar to the cofinite topology but we have a finite space here, so it doesn't really work. First off, the $f_{i,j}$ are easily seen to be continuous, but $U_i :=\{1\} \cup \{i\}$ is always open in $X_i$ , which means that $U = \Pi_i U_i$ is open in $X$ , but this corresponds to $\{A_1, A_\infty\}$ open, which we do not want since $\{(0), (2)\}$ is not open in $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}$ . What else could I try here? It seems like that the topology on $X_i$ needs to have bigger and bigger open sets so that in the limit we get infinitely big non-empty open sets, and also otherwise some finite union of the $A_i$ would be open. But these open sets also have to be stable under intersection, so in some way, they need to be somehow included in each other, so intersections cannot become arbitrarily small.  Also, we need to guarantee continuity of the maps $f_{i,j}$ .","['general-topology', 'algebraic-geometry', 'limits-colimits']"
4802488,Compact-open Topology for Partial Maps?,"Compact open topology is one of the most common ways of turning the set of continuous maps between two topological spaces into a topological space. Suppose $X, Y$ are topological spaces, and let $K\subseteq X$ be a compact subset and $U\subseteq Y$ be an open subset. $$V_{K, U}=\{f: X\to Y \mid f(K)\subseteq U\}$$ Then the collection of all such $V_{K, U}$ is a subbase for the compact-open topology on $C(X, Y).$ A partial map $f: X\rightharpoonup Y$ is a function from some subset $X_f\subseteq X$ to $Y.$ To define continuity  in this context, consider the totalization $$\widetilde{f}(x) =
\begin{cases}
f(x),  & \text{if $x\in X_f$} \\
\star, & \text{if $x\notin X_f$}
\end{cases}$$ where $\star\notin Y,$ and equip $\widetilde{Y}=Y\cup\{\star\}$ with the smallest topology extending that of $Y.$ i.e., $U\subseteq \widetilde{Y}$ is open iff $U=\widetilde{Y}$ or $U$ is open in $Y.$ Then claim $f: X\rightharpoonup Y$ is continuous iff $\widetilde{f}: X\to\widetilde{Y}$ is continuous. Observe that this definition doesn't alter the continuity of total maps. Now, I want to understand how we can have a nice topology on the set of all continuous partial maps between $X$ and $Y.$ Since there is a bijection between $\{X\rightharpoonup Y\}$ and $\{X\to \widetilde{Y}\},$ I'm thinking that we can simply look at the compact-open topology on $C(X, \widetilde{Y}).$ But I'm not sure that this is the correct/best way to topologize the space of partial maps. I need the opinion of somebody who has some experience in this area. Are there other ways of defining continuity for partial maps? If so, how is this topology different from those? Has anyone studied this problem before?","['continuity', 'partial-functions', 'functional-analysis', 'uniform-convergence', 'general-topology']"

I want to show that for any two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$ , I can find a path of length $\geq k$ joining them. I thought I could prove this by induction on $n=|V(G)|$ .

If $G'$ is no longer $2$ -connected however, I'm not sure how to proceed.

4802526,Upper bound on second fundamental form,"Consider a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and let $V$ and $W$ be two vector fields on $\mathcal{M}$ . As usual, we define the second fundamental form to be $ \mathrm{I\!I}(V, W) = (\tilde{\nabla}_V (W))^\perp $ , where $\tilde{\nabla}$ is the ambient covariant derivative and $X^\perp$ represents the normal projection of $X$ . I am interested in bounding $\| \mathrm{I\!I}(V, W) \|$ in terms of the bounds on the norms of $V$ and $W$ . For example, when the manifold is the sphere with the usual inherited metric, assuming that for all $x$ it holds that $\| V(x) \| \leq \alpha $ and $\| W(X) \| \leq \beta $ , I believe we have $\| \mathrm{I\!I}(V, W) \| \leq \alpha \beta $ . In general, I would expect such a bound to also depend on the curvature of the manifold. Later edit : when $\mathcal{M}$ is a hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^d$ , letting $N$ be a smooth normal vector field, I know that $ \| \mathrm{I\!I}(V, W) \| =  \lvert \langle N, \mathrm{I\!I}(V, W) \rangle \rvert = \lvert h(V, W) \rvert $ , where $h$ is the scalar second fundamental form. In this case, the principal curvatures $\mathcal{k}_i$ are defined as the eigenalues of the shape operator $s : T_x \mathcal{M} \rightarrow T_x \mathcal{M}$ , $s = W_N$ , where $W_N$ is the Weingarten map in direction $N$ . We can write $h(V, W)$ in the basis of $T_x \mathcal{M}$ given by the eigenvectors $b_i$ of $s$ (with corresponding eigenvalue $\mathcal{k}_i$ ) to obtain $$ h(V, W) = \langle W, sV \rangle = \langle W, s \sum_i \langle V, b_i \rangle b_i \rangle = \sum_i \mathcal{k}_i \langle V, b_i \rangle \langle W, b_i \rangle $$ From here, it's easy to obtain a bound on $\lvert h(V, W) \rvert$ in terms of the maximum principal curvature. The question would be how to extend this for the case when $\mathcal{M}$ is an arbitrary smooth manifold. I know, for example, that the second fundamental form is related to the Riemann curvature tensor through the Gauss Equation (in Lee's Riemannian manifolds, Theorem 8.5), but it's not clear how to proceed from there. I am willing to assume I have bounds on (any sort of) curvature that comes up.

4802615,Prove that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{1}{\log_2(a_n)}$ converges.,"Let $a_0 = 2.$ For $n\ge 1,$ let $a_n$ be the smallest positive integer so that $\sum_{j=0}^n 1/a_j < 1$ . Prove that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{1}{\log_2(a_n)}$ converges. I think one can come up with a recurrence relation for the $a_n$ 's.  Computing a few values of $a_n,$ we get that the sequence starts with $2,3,7,43.$ Now if we guess that the sequence is quadratic so that $a_{n+1} = A a_n^2 + B a_n + C$ for some constants A,B,C, then we can arrive at the formula $a_{n+1} = a_n^2 - a_n+1.$ This formula can be proved by induction if we additionally prove that $\sum_{j=0}^n 1/a_j = 1 - 1/(a_n^2 - a_n)$ , with the base case of $n=1$ being obvious. Now assume the formula holds for some $n\ge 1.$ Then $a_{n+1} = a_n^2 - a_n + 1$ by the inductive hypothesis, and $\sum_{j=0}^{n+1} 1/a_j = 1 - 1/((a_n^2 - a_n)(a_n^2 - a_n+1)) = 1 - 1/(a_{n+1}(a_{n+1}-1)).$ So $a_{n+2} = a_{n+1}^2 - a_{n+1}+1$ .

Where are the zero's of this function? That is, what are the solutions of $$ f(z) = 0$$ Notice this function is entire and completely determined by its zero's.
This follows from the fact that it grows much slower than exponential on the complex plane and theorems like Weierstrass factorization theorem and Hadamard factorization theorem. Does this function have infinitely many real zero's ? Does the real limit $$\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = A$$ exist ? Sorry for asking 3 things at once but it is so related.
It would probably be silly turning this into 3 seperate question posts. Background For those wondering why I picked this function I was looking for real zero's of entire functions that resemble $\exp(x)$ or somewhat slower functions. See : $0 \leq C + \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} \frac{x^n}{(n+1)^n} $ ,where $C = 1.036055393...$ is the best possible constant. and the related questions. I want to understand special functions better, in particular those that are completely determined by their (complex) zero's. $\exp(\ln^2(n+1))$ grows faster than any polynomial, so this function is way different than $\exp(x)$ or $\operatorname{Ei}(x) - \ln(x)$ or their generalizations. I need imo a better understanding of limits in real analysis.

4802718,"When number theorists use the notation $\sum_{d|n}$, why don't they count the ""multiplicity"" of a divisor? Why is it not-so-interesting to count it?","This is a question a student asked me when I was teaching a class. When I use the notation $\sum_{d|n}f(d)$ , each divisor is only counted once without multiplicity. If $n=4$ , then $\sum_{d|4}f(d)=f(1)+f(2)+f(4)$ instead of $\sum_{d|4}f(d)=f(1)+2f(2)+f(4)$ .  But instead of just telling the student, this is just what this notation is defined. It is the convention . I can also say, oh you can think of $f(4)$ as ""counting the multiplicity"" but I am also not satisfied with this answer as well. Are there any more insightful explanations from experts in number theory? For example, in the definition of the divisor sum functions $\sigma_k(n)$ , we don't count the multiplicity of a divisor. But is there a reason that ""counting the multiplicity of a divisor"" not so interesting? Or there are people who seriously studied it and I just missed an important part of literature. As per comments below, maybe let me try to define ""multiplicity"" here, which is by no means standard definitions in number theory, there are two possible ways I can think of (when that student asked this question, they didn't think very hard about it. They just believe $2$ shouldn't be counted just once as a divisor of $4$ ): Definition 1: If $d\ne 1$ is a divisor of $n$ , then the multiplicity of $d$ in $n$ is the largest $k$ such that $d^k|n$ . The multiplicity of $1$ in $n$ is considered as $1$ . For example, the multiplicity of $2$ in $8$ is $3$ . The multiplicity of $6$ in $12$ under this definition is $1$ . Definition 2: If If $d\ne 1$ is a divisor of $n$ , suppose $d=p_1^{r_1}\cdots p_l^{r_l}$ and $n=d=p_1^{s_1}\cdots p_k^{s_k}$ with $l\le k, r_i\le s_i$ , then the multiplicity of $d$ in $n$ is $\binom{s_1}{r_1}\cdots \binom{s_l}{r_l}$ .

4802953,Dubious tensor-hom adjunction for chain complexes in Weibel. The differentials are wrong; can we make them right?,"$\newcommand{\hom}{\mathsf{Hom}}\newcommand{\tot}{\mathsf{Tot}}$ The exercise $2.7.3$ from Weibel's ""an introduction to homological algebra"" is known to be incorrectly stated . However, even for the revised version given in that link, I think there may be an error. In a comment under that post it is said this isomorphism is useful for proving some results such as a Kunneth formula so I would quite like everything to actually work! For any chain complexes $A,B$ of right and left $R$ -modules and any cochain complex $G$ of Abelian groups, it is claimed that: $$\tag{$\ast$}\tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(\tot^{\oplus}(A\otimes_R B),G))\cong\tot(\hom_R(A,\tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(B,G)))$$ As a natural isomorphism of cochain complexes. On objects I can see this: We want a map, for each $n\in\Bbb Z$ , from: $$\prod_{k,\ell\in\Bbb Z}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_\ell\otimes_RB_{k-\ell},G^{n-k})\overset{?}{\cong}\prod_{i,j\in\Bbb Z}\hom_R(A_i,\hom_\Bbb Z(B_j,G^{n-i-j}))$$ Such a map is determined by its $(i,j)$ th projections, which will be: $$\prod_{k\in\Bbb Z}\prod_{\ell\in\Bbb Z}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_\ell\otimes_RB_{k-\ell},G^{n-k})\overset{\pi_{i+j}}{\twoheadrightarrow}\prod_{\ell\in\Bbb Z}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_\ell\otimes_RB_{i+j-\ell},G^{n-i-j})\\\overset{\pi_i}{\twoheadrightarrow}\hom_\Bbb Z(A_i\otimes_RB_j,G^{n-i-j})\cong\hom_R(A_i,\hom_\Bbb Z(B_j,G^{n-i-j}))$$ Where the last isomorphism is the canonical tensor-hom adjunction isomorphism. This map is clearly an isomorphism. However, I remain entirely unconvinced that this is an isomorphism of chain complexes . Namely, the map I described above is not a chain map (as per the sign conventions Weibel uses, detailed below). Specifically, I have computed that for $n\in\Bbb Z$ and a family $(g_{k,\ell})_{k,\ell\in\Bbb Z}$ of homomorphisms $A_\ell\otimes_RB_{k-\ell}\to G^{n-k}$ , the element $\left(\sum_{\ell\in\Bbb Z}g_{k,\ell}\right)_{k\in\Bbb Z}$ of $\tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(\tot^{\oplus}(A\otimes_RB),G))^n$ is mapped to two distinct destinations: $$\tag{1}\left(\prod_{j\in\Bbb Z}(\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i-1}\circ d_i+(-1)^id_j^\ast\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i}+(-1)^{n+1}d_\ast^{n-i-j}\overline{g}_{i+j,i}\right)_{i\in\Bbb Z}$$ And: $$\tag{2}\left(\prod_{j\in\Bbb Z}(\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i-1}\circ d_i+(-1)^id_\ast^{n-i-j}\overline{g}_{i+j,i}+(-1)^{n+1}d^\ast_j\overline{g}_{i+j-1,i}\right)_{i\in\Bbb Z}$$ Both describing elements of $\tot(\hom_R(A,\tot(\hom_\Bbb Z(B,G))))^{n+1}$ . Where $(1)$ is what you get when you apply first the differential of the left hand cocomplex and then apply the isomorphism $(\ast)$ , and $(2)$ is what you get if you first apply the isomorphism of $(\ast)$ and then apply the differential of the right hand cocomplex. That is, the commutative square for $(\ast)$ to be a cochain map is not actually commutative! I've run through that calculation twice being very attentive to which sign conventions apply when, so I'm confident - but if I still somehow screwed it up and everything is fine as-is, please let me know. My questions: Can we alter the choice of levelwise isomorphism in $(\ast)$ so that this really is a bona fide isomorphism of cochain complexes? I suspect yes because it's only slightly wrong (the final two summands differ by $(-1)^{n+i+1})$ but I can't see it myself (the indexing scares me) Alternatively, is my choice of isomorphism in $(\ast)$ correct as written if you use different sign conventions to Weibel ? Note these different sign conventions should still have the nice properties such as satisfying the double complex condition. I would be unhappy if a different sign convention is truly necessary since that somewhat invalidates the material of the book. Definitions, conventions: Given a chain complex $C$ and a cochain complex $K$ in an Abelian category, Weibel defines the hom double cochain complex $\hom(C_\bullet,K^\bullet)$ to have horizontal differentials: $$d_h^{k,\ell}:=(d^C_{k+1})^\ast:\hom(C_k,D^\ell)\to\hom(C_{k+1},D^\ell)$$ and vertical differentials: $$d_v^{k,\ell}:=(-1)^{k+\ell+1}\cdot(d_D^\ell)_\ast:\hom(C_k,D^\ell)\to\hom(C_k,D^{\ell+1})$$ Given chain complexes of right and left $R$ -modules $A$ and $B$ , he defines $A\otimes_RB$ to be the double chain complex of Abelian groups $A_\bullet\otimes_R B_\bullet$ where again the differentials are twisted by a sign: the horizontals: $$d^h_{k,\ell}:=d^A_k\otimes1:A_k\otimes_RB_\ell\to A_{k-1}\otimes_RB_\ell$$ And verticals: $$d^v_{k,\ell}:=(-1)^k\otimes d^B_\ell:A_k\otimes_RB_\ell\to A_k\otimes_RB_{\ell-1}$$","['homological-algebra', 'convention', 'abstract-algebra']"

The classical Gronwall lemma is of course not applicable here, since the functions involved are not nonnegative. For instance, if we try to repeat the proof of the usual Gronwall inequality, then formally we have $$\frac{d}{dt}\left(A+\left|\int_0^t B\cos(s^2)u(s)ds\right|\right) = B\cos(t^2)u(t)\text{sgn}\left(\int_0^t B\cos(s^2)u(s)ds\right)\leq B|u(t)|$$ After using the bound on $|u(t)|$ we get $$\frac{d}{dt}

Technically, this counterexample is for a modified problem, but the ideas are similar. Indeed, for any fixed $A,B$ we can find $u$ satisfying $$|u(t)|\leq A+\left|\int_0^t Be^{is^2}u(s)ds\right|$$ but whose modulus grows exponentially in time (as suggested by the calculation from earlier). Indeed, set $u(t) = Ae^{-it^2}e^{Bt}$ . Then we have $$A+\left|\int_0^t Be^{is^2}u(s)ds\right| = A+(Ae^{Bt} - A) = Ae^{Bt} = |u(t)|$$ It seems harder to come up with an explicit counterexample to the original problem, which suggests the problem may depend on the zeros of the oscillatory kernel.","['oscillatory-integral', 'gronwall-type-inequality', 'harmonic-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

\dot V(x,y,z)=-2x^4-2y^2(x^2+z^2+1)-2z\sin z

It says that In particular, any solution that begins in the region $|z|<\pi$ must remain trapped in this region for all time. Moreover, we can conclude that the basin of attraction of the origin is the entire region $|z|<\pi$ . Any solutions that starts insider a sphere of radius $r<\pi$ must tend to the origin. Outsider of the sphere of radius $\pi$ and between the planes $|z|=\pi$ , the function $V$ is still strictly decreasing. Since solutions are trapped between these two planes, it follows that they too must tend to the origin. For the first part, since $$

4803330,Understanding's Wikipedia's definition of a spinor,"I am trying to understand spinors from a mathematical view. I've seen similar questions on this website but I'm still unclear on what they are exactly. On Wikipedia they state: Although spinors can be defined purely as elements of a representation space of the spin group (or its Lie algebra of infinitesimal rotations), they are typically defined as elements of a vector space that carries a linear representation of the Clifford algebra. What confuses me is say we are working on space time so that $\mathbb{R}^4$ is our vector space. Going by the above passage, a spinor would be an element of $\mathbb{R}^4$ that carries a representation of the spin group, let us denote this pair as $(x, \rho)$ where $\rho$ is the representation. However $x$ is itself also a vector since $x \in \mathbb{R}^4$ . So why are vectors and spinors referred to as two different objects? In other words, how does the representation play any role in describing the spinor itself (which as I understand is simply a vector in the underlying vector space)? My current guess is that spinors are always to be taken as a pair consisting of a vector and a representation, for example $(x, \rho)$ above. Thus, spinors are actually also vectors, but the difference is that when you talk about rotations then spinors ""rotate"" differently than an ordinary vector in $\mathbb{R}^4$ . However I am not sure if this is right since most textbooks do not describe anything along these lines. For example, no physics textbook describes a spinor as a pair $(x, \rho)$ . Is this implicitly assumed?","['differential-geometry', 'spin-geometry', 'representation-theory', 'mathematical-physics', 'clifford-algebras']"

I've shown the normality of the subgroup of order $5$ by its uniqueness but such a trick does not work with $3$ because $3$ is too small. I know by the 3rd Sylow theorem that $N\equiv 1 \mod 3$ where $N$ is the number of subgroups of order $3$ and since $N\mid 15$ it must be $1$ .

4803481,Why is the probability that two random chords intersect $2/3$?,"In a circle, a random chord is drawn by connecting a uniformly random point on the circle, with a uniformly random point on the opposite semicircle .

I used Excel to run $10^6$ trials, and the proportion of intersecting chords was $0.6665$ , suggesting that the probability is $2/3$ . I am seeking an intuitive explanation for this result. Examples of intuitive explanations Here is an example of an intuitive explanation. Suppose, instead, a random chord is drawn by connecting two uniformly random points on the circle, and we want to find the probability that two such chords intersect. First pick four random points on the circle, labelled $A,B,C,D$ going clockwise. Then pair them randomly, and connect each pair to form two chords. The chords intersect if and only if $A$ is connected to $C$ , which has a probability of $1/3$ .) Here and here are other examples of intuitive explanations. Context I have been thinking about probability questions that have simple answers, but seem to resist intuitive explanation, for example this one . I am also interested in questions about random chords, for example this one . EDIT If a random chord is drawn by connecting a uniformly random point on the circle, with a uniformly random point chosen from the arc with central angle $n\pi$ directly opposite the first point, then what is the probability that two such chords intersect? Well, if $n=0$ , then the probability is obviously $1$ . And if $n=2$ , then the probability is $1/3$ , as explained above. So, assuming that the relationship between $n$ and the probability is linear, then it follows that if $n=1$ (which is the OP) then the probability is indeed $2/3$ . But is it intuitively obvious that the relationship is linear? (In fact, numerical investigation shows that the relationship is linear, i.e. the probability $1-\frac{n}{3}$ .)","['intuition', 'circles', 'geometry', 'probability']"

Besides, since $a,b \in \{ 1 \dots nm \}$ , each of this equivalence classes contains $n$ elements, (this is, every component of the graph has $n$ vertex), and since this equivalence relation is obviously transitive, each of those vertices are connected with each other, this is, there are $m$ independent $K_n$ 's, where $K_n$ is the complete graph of $n$ vertices.

Solutions In a previous post, On sums of three cubes of form $a^3+b^3+c^3=(c+1)^3$ , an example of which is the well-known, $$3^3+4^3+5^3=6^3$$ we asked if there were polynomial parameterizations higher than 3rd degree . The answer was in the affirmative . In this new question, we ask if more ""triplet parameterizations"" can be found. These ""triplets"" will be described below. First, the equation $a^3+b^3+c^3=(c+1)^3$ can be solved as a quadratic in $c$ , namely, $$c =  \frac{-3+\sqrt{12(a^3+b^3)-3}}6$$ Hence the condition is akin to an elliptic curve, $$P(a,b):=12(a^3+b^3)-3 = y^2$$ but is to be solved by integer polynomials. Ten solutions have been found so far, the first three being, $$a_1 = n,\quad b_1 = 3n^2+2n+1$$ $$a_{2,3} = 3n^2, \quad b_{2,3} = 6n^2\pm3n+1\quad$$ The next three found by Old Peter and based on, $$(\color{blue}{9n^3})^3 + (\color{blue}{-9n^3 + 9n^2 - 3n + 1})^3 + (27n^4 - 18n^3 + 9n^2 - 3n)^3 = (27n^4 - 18n^3 + 9n^2 - 3n + 1)^3$$ thus the first triplet , \begin{align}
a_4 = 9n^3,\quad  &b_4 = -9n^3 + 9n^2 - 3n + 1\\[6pt]
a_5 = \color{blue}{9n^3},\quad  &b_5 = 27n^4 + 18n^3 + 9n^2 + 3n + 1\quad\\[6pt]
a_6 = \color{blue}{9n^3 + 9n^2 + 3n + 1},  \quad &b_6 = 27n^4 + 18n^3 + 9n^2 + 3n
\end{align} The latter two will yield different $a^3+b^3+c^3=(c+1)^3$ where all terms are positive for $n>0$ .  For example, let the triplet $a_k,b_k$ as defined and $c_k =  \frac16\left(-3+\sqrt{12(a^3+b^3)-3}\right)$ , then for $n=1$ , $$9^3 - 2^3 + 15^3 = 16^3\\ 9^3 + 58^3 + 255^3 = 256^3\\  22^3 + 57^3 + 255^3 = 256^3$$ I don't know why a parameterization for $u_1^3+u_2^3 = u_3^3+u_4^3$ will yield a pair for $v_1^3+v_2^3+v_3^3=v_4^3,$ with all the terms $(u_i, v_i)$ positive for $n>0.$ The next three were found by yours truly and based on, $$(\color{red}{9n^3 + 6n^2 + 1})^3 + (\color{red}{-9n^3 + 3n^2 - 3n})^3 + (27n^4 + 6n^2)^3 = (27n^4 +  6n^2 + 1)^3$$ thus the second triplet , \begin{align}
a_7 = 9n^3 + 6n^2 + 1,\quad  &b_7 = -9n^3 + 3n^2 - 3n\\[6pt]
\quad a_8 = \color{red}{9n^3 + 6n^2 + 1},\quad  &b_8 = 27n^4 + 18n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n\\[6pt]
a_9 = \color{red}{9n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n},  \quad &b_9 = 27n^4 + 18n^3 + 15n^2 + 3n + 1
\end{align} Again, the latter two will yield all terms positive for $n>0$ . For example, let $n=1$ , $$16^3 - 9^3 + 33^3 = 34^3\\ 16^3 + 51^3 + 213^3 = 214^3\\ 15^3 + 64^3 + 297^3 = 298^3$$ And the 10th by Adam Bailey, $$a_{10} = (3n + 1)(9n^3 + 15n^2 + 10n + 3),\quad b_{10} = (3n + 1)^2(6n^2 + 5n + 3) + 1\qquad $$ II. Addendum There is a curious connection to Ramanujan's work. The two triplets are related by, $$a_4+b_4 = a_7+b_7 = \color{magenta}{9n^2 - 3n + 1}$$ a polynomial which is quite important to "" real cubic fields "". The discriminant $d$ of, $$x^3 + x^2 - (3 n^2 + n)x + n^3=0$$ is $d=-n^2(\color{magenta}{9n^2+3n+1})^2$ . Since it is a negative square, the cubic always has three real roots $x_i$ . Then we have Ramanujan's nice identity , $$x_1^{1/3}+x_2^{1/3}+x_3^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{-(6n+1)+3\sqrt[3]{n(9n^2+3n+1)}}$$ For $n=-1$ , we recover his well-known, $$\sqrt[3]{\cos\tfrac{2\pi}7}+\sqrt[3]{\cos\tfrac{4\pi}7}+\sqrt[3]{\cos\tfrac{8\pi}7}=\sqrt[3]{\tfrac{5-3\,\sqrt[3]7}2}$$ III. Questions: Can you find more polynomial solutions to $P(a,b):=12(a^3+b^3)-3 = y^2$ , especially if it is a triplet? One may notice they seem to be based on $a^3\color{red}-b^3+c^3 = (c+1)^3$ . And why do some solutions manifest as a triplet? (For example, I can't tease out a triplet from Bailey's solution.)","['cubics', 'number-theory', 'parametrization', 'diophantine-equations']"
4803762,An unzipping problem,"Imagine a continuous one-dimensional line, which is duplicated exactly once. Duplication starts at random spacetime points. Once a point is duplicated, it starts a double duplication wave moving in either direction at constant speed $v$ (similar to a bi-directional zipper), as the following animation suggests $I(x,t)$ is defined as the probability the position $x$ , if not already duplicated at time $t$ , initiates a double wave at time $t$ . Consider now a large number of lines and define $s(x,t)$ as the fraction of lines where position $x$ has not yet been duplicated ( $I(x,t)$ is the same across all lines). From this definition, we may extract the probability distribution of duplication timing. First, note that a position $x$ is not duplicated at time $t$ iff its duplication timing $t_D(x)$ is greater than $t$ . Therefore the probability distribution $P(x,t)$ of the duplication timing at position $x$ is given by $$
P(x,t)=-\partial_t s(x,t)
$$ as $s(x,t)=\text{Prob}(t_D(x)\geq t)$ . Question: In my modelling approach, I define the term $f(x)$ , which is the rate of initiation at position $x$ , constant in time, which should be related to $I(x,t)$ in some form. I am interested in determining the expected time of duplication at a given position $x$ , defined as $\langle t_D(x)\rangle$ and inverting the problem: is it possible to write the initiation rate $f(x)$ in terms of $\langle t_D(x)\rangle$ ? $\langle t_D(x)\rangle$ has also been discussed here , from a different perspective. My attempt: For infinite and continuous lines, this problem has been studied in the context of nucleation and replication . In particular, it was shown that, using light-cone coordinates, $$
s(x,t)=e^{-\int_{V_X[v]}dYI(Y)}
$$ where $V_X[v]$ is the past light cone of the spacetime point $X=(x,t)$ . This equation has the following elegant inverse, using the D'Alembert operator $\square=\frac{1}{v^2}\partial_t^2-\partial_x^2$ , $$
I(x,t)=-\frac{v}{2}\square \log s(x,t)
$$ On the other hand, given the probabilistic description provided before, we also have $$
\langle t_D(x)\rangle=\int_0^\infty tP(x,t)\,dt=-\int_0^\infty t\partial_ts(x,t)\,dt
$$ However, from here, it is not clear how to rewrite this so that I have the rate $f(x)$ as a function of $\langle t_D(x)\rangle$ . In particular, how are $I(x,t)$ and $f(x)$ related? The general steps could potentially be: Write $s(x,t)$ in terms of $\langle t_D(x)\rangle$ . Use D'Alembert formula to write $I(x,t)$ in terms of $\langle t_D(x)\rangle$ . Write $f(x)$ in terms of $I(x,t)$ . What happens in the discrete space case, where duplication only starts at specific points $\{x_i\}$ (say integers in the real line, for simplicity)? For instance, what happens when $I(x,t)\equiv\sum_{y\in\mathbb{Z}}\delta(x-y)I(x,t)$ ? Any ideas? Other general ideas: The inverse Laplace transform could prove useful to invert the previous equation, but not too sure how . Similarly, the Lambert W function could hold some useful information. Initiation is a Poisson process where only the first event matters (there is no re-duplication), therefore can conditionality be relaxed and is there a direct relation between initiation rate $f(x)$ and probability $I(x,t)$ over time? In particular, due to the constant speed, waves do not overlap and the expected time should be the same nonetheless.

4803952,Dominated convergence of series of powers,"Let $(a_i) \in \mathbb{C}$ be a sequence of complex numbers s.t. $|a_i| < 1$ for every $i$ and $$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i^k \text{ is convergent for all } k \in \mathbb{N} $$ Then, must it be the case that $\lim_k \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i^k = 0 $ ? This is a question that arose for me while tackling a competition-style problem, for which a proof of this would give me a full solution. However, I think it is of interest within its own right as well. Note that if the series corresponding to $(a_i)$ were absolutely convergent, then this would follow essentially from the dominated convergence theorem. It may also be observed that, in general, there is no need for there to exist $k$ s.t. $\sum a_i^k$ is absolutely convergent, since $\bigcup_p \ell^p \neq c_0$ , where $c_0$ is the space of all sequences converging to zero.","['convergence-divergence', 'complex-numbers', 'analysis', 'sequences-and-series']"

4804022,How do properties of a function change as you move away from its derivatives?,"I have the following question on how the properties of a function change as you move away from points where its derivative are 0. To give some context to my question, I will break it into 3 parts. Part 1: Suppose we take the Poisson Probability Distribution: \begin{equation}
P(X=k;\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
\end{equation} We can define the likelihood function as: \begin{equation}
L(\lambda; x) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i=k_i;\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\lambda^{k_i} e^{-\lambda}}{k_i!}
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
l(\lambda; x) = \ln L(\lambda; x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} [k_i \ln \lambda - \lambda - \ln (k_i!)]
\end{equation} To find the MLE, we take the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to $\lambda$ , set it to zero, and solve for $\lambda$ : \begin{equation}
\frac{dl}{d\lambda} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} [ \frac{k_i}{\lambda} - 1] = 0
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
\hat{\lambda}_{\text{MLE}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i
\end{equation} Part 2: After having derived the MLE of the Poisson Distribution, we can apply the ""useful"" properties of MLE theory to this MLE (e.g. https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/vdukic/Bayes/likprinc_lect2.pdf ). This includes properties such as: Consistency : The sample value of the MLE estimator approaches the true value as the sample size approaches infinity Asymptotic Normality: The distribution of the MLE estimator approaches a Normal Distribution as the sample size approaches infinity Efficiency (via Cramer-Rao Lower Bound) : The variance of the MLE estimator is lowest possible variance out of all similar estimators Invariance: If $\hat{\lambda}_{\text{MLE}}$ is the MLE estimator of $\lambda$ , then $g(\hat{\lambda}_{\text{MLE}})$ is the MLE estimator of $g(\lambda)$ Part 3: In the above example ( Part 1 ), the MLE had a closed-form analytical solution. But in real world problems, the likelihood function can be multi-dimensional and the derivatives need to be numerically approximated. This means that there is always a risk that the numerically approximated solution to the MLE will not be the exact MLE. And the ""useful theoretical properties"" ( Part 2 ) might not fully apply to the numerically approximated solution. My Question: But to what extent do these theoretical properties apply to the numerically approximated MLE solution .... as the numerically approximated solution moves further away from the true MLE solution? Using the R programming language, I simulated 100 points from a Poisson Distribution with $\lambda$ = 5. I then calculated the log-likelihood function and the MLE estimated for $\lambda$ based on these 100 simulated points. I then plotted the log-likelihood function alongside the true MLE solution (i.e. $\lambda = 5$ ) , the MLE estimate and two random candidate solutions: # Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Simulate 100 points from a Poisson distribution with lambda = 5
data <- rpois(100, 5)

# Estimate lambda using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
lambda_mle <- mean(data)

# Define the log-likelihood function
log_likelihood <- function(lambda) {
    sum(dpois(data, lambda, log = TRUE))
}

# Create a sequence of lambda values
lambda_values <- seq(5, 5.5, by = 0.01)

# Calculate the log-likelihood for each lambda value (plotting code has been omitted for brevity, I can post this as well if necessary)
log_likelihood_values <- sapply(lambda_values, log_likelihood) In the above graph, since Candidate Solution #1 is closer to the true MLE solution compared to Candidate Solution #2 -  would the theoretical properties of MLE be more applicable to Candidate Solution #1 compared to Candidate Solution #2 ? And how much more applicable? In the above graph it might be obvious, but I am not sure how this concept generalizes to higher dimensional problems. Is there some mathematical proof which can show that certain theoretical properties known at the true solution .... are more applicable to candidate (numerical) solutions that are closer to the true solution compared to candidate solutions that are further away from the true solution? Thanks! Note: I am wondering if there some mathematical framework here, e.g. draw a ball of radius ""r"" around the likelihood function at its true MLE solution. Perhaps, there might be some mathematical proof that shows ALL solutions located exactly ""r"" units away from the true solution are just as good (so long as they are valid solutions, e.g. certain MLE parameters have constraints, e.g. variance estimates are non-negative)? Using the same logic, if $r_1$ > $r_2$ , then .... the set of all solutions located exactly $r_2$ units away from the true MLE are ""better"" than the set of all solutions located exactly $r_1$ units away from the true MLE?","['functions', 'derivatives', 'probability']"

4804025,If a holomorphic function $f$ from the open ball to the complex numbers have bounded derivative then $|\frac{f^{n}(0)}{n!}|\leq e$,"The problem is the following. Let $B_1(0)=\lbrace z\in \mathbb{C}: |z|<1\rbrace$ and consider a holomorphic function $f:B_1(0)\to \mathbb{C}$ such that $|f^{\prime}(z)|\leq \frac{1}{1-|z|}$ for all $z\in B_1(0)$ . Show that $$|\frac{f^{n}(0)}{n!}|\leq e$$ where $f^n(0)$ denote the $n$ -th derivative of $f$ evaluated in $0$ . I already take arround four hours and don not get a good idea. Attempt .
First of all I try join the information about each coefficient of the taylor series of $f$ . Since $B_1(0)$ is convex then it is simply connected and since $f$ is holomorphic we have by Cauchy integral Formula that for each $0<r<1$ and closed curve $\gamma:[0,2\pi]\to B_1(0)$ given by $\gamma(t)=re^{2\pi it}$ $$f^n(0)I(\gamma,0)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma}\frac{f(z)}{z^{n}}dz$$ and thus $$\left|\frac{f^{n}(0)}{n!}\right|\leq \frac{\operatorname{sup}_{z\in \gamma}|f(z)|}{r^{n}}$$ And this is all the information that I get from this. For other side, the bound in the derivative of $f$ tell me that for $z=0$ we have that $|f^{\prime}(0)|\leq 1$ . This lead me the possible intuition that I can also bound the other coefficients by $1$ . This is all the things that I have in mind, but I look myself too far of the solution. Any idea or hint is welcome. Update From the hints given in the comments. Let $g:B_1(0)\to \mathbb{C}$ given by $g(z)=f^{\prime}(z)$ and notice that since $f$ is holomorphic in a simply connected set, then all their derivatives exists and also are holomorphic in $B_1(0)$ . Thus we can also apply the Cauchy Integral formula to $g$ in the point $z_0=0$ to conclude that for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and closed curve $\gamma_n:[0,2\pi]\to \mathbb{C}$ given by $\gamma(t)=r_ne^{2\pi it}$ .
we have $$\left| \frac{g^{n}(0)}{n!}\right|\leq \frac{1}{2\pi}\cdot |g(z)|\cdot 2\pi=\frac{\frac{1}{1-r_n}}{r_{n}^{n}}$$ And since $g=f^{\prime}$ we get $g^{n}(0)=f^{n+1}(0)$ . Moreover, since $|g(z)|\leq \frac{1}{1-|z|}$ for all $z\in B_1(0)$ we conclude $$ \left| \frac{f^{n+1}(0)}{n!}\right|\leq \frac{\frac{1}{1-r_n}}{r_{n}^{n}} $$ and if we multiply by $(n+1)^{-1}$ both sides, then $$ \left| \frac{f^{n+1}(0)}{(n+1)!}\right|\leq \frac{\frac{1}{1-r_n}}{r_{n}^{n}(n+1)}$$ for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$ Finally, is sufficient choose a correct sequence of radius. For this we  can choose for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$ the closed curve $\gamma_n:[0,2\pi]\to \mathbb{C}$ given by $\gamma(t)=(1-\frac{1}{n+1})e^{2\pi i t}$ for which we have $$\left| \frac{f^{n+1}(0)}{(n+1)!}\right|\leq \frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{n+1})^{n}}$$ and taking $n\to \infty$ we have $$\left| \frac{f^{n+1}(0)}{(n+1)!}\right|\leq e$$ as desired.

As far as I know, the space of random variables is complete with the $p$ -convergence, i.e. all Cauchy series of it is convergent. Basically this is the reason why the $p$ -limit of $I_{n}$ also exists. But does it also mean that the $p$ -limit of $I_{n}$ is also $\mathcal{F}_{t}$ -measurable? I mean, otherwise it wouldn't make sense to “calculate” $\mathbf{P}\left(\omega:\left|I_{n}-I\right|>\varepsilon\right)$ in the definition of the $p$ -limit: “calculating” the measure of the set $\left\{ \omega:\left|I_{n}-I\right|>\varepsilon\right\}$ implicitly assumes that the set is measurable, i.e. the terms in it, such as $I$ is also measurable. But this reasoning just doesn't feel good, I feel like I mixing the definition of ""measurable"" and $\mathcal{F}_{t}$ -measurable. So in short: what guarantees that the process $I$ is adapted, i.e. $\mathcal{F}_{t}$ -measurable for all $t$ ?

The screw is given by dual vector (Pluecker coordinates) ${\bf v} = {\bf u} (\theta + \epsilon d)$ . Here, $|{\bf u}| = 1$ , $\theta$ is the half-angle about the screw axis, $d$ is the half-distance along the screw axis, and $\epsilon$ is the dual unit ( $\epsilon^2 = 0$ ). I'm looking for an analytical solution for finding the real parameter $t$ such that the magnitude of the relative pose ${\bf q}_1^*{\bf q}_2$ is minimized. Since our definition of magnitude is a real number and includes both rotation and translation, we define the magnitude of a dual quaternion ${\bf a} + \epsilon {\bf b}$ as: ${\rm mag}({\bf a} + \epsilon {\bf b}) = c_1| \log {\bf a}|^2 + c_2 | {\bf b} {\bf a}^*|^2$ .

We need to minimize $f(t) = {\rm mag}({\bf r})$ . This would boil down to finding $t$ for which $\frac{d f(t)}{d t} = 0$ . I'm well aware that there may be multiple, if not an infinite number of, solutions. I made an attempt at solving this, but stranded in the trig equations.

4804268,What's the point of a Story Proof?,"I've been working through the Stat 110 Lecture Series and have come across the idea of Story Proofs. I've read the following from the author's book on the subject: A story proof is a proof by interpretation. For counting problems, this often means counting the same thing in two different ways, rather than doing tedious algebra. A story proof often avoids messy calculations and goes further than an algebraic proof toward explaining why the result is true. The word “story” has several meanings, some more mathematical than others, but a story proof (in the sense in which we’re using the term) is a fully valid mathematical proof. - Introduction To Probability, page 20. But what does the proof consist of? It appears a story proof creates two real-world scenarios that supposedly count the same thing, defines both counting situations in mathematics, and equates them. Fine, but without checking the mathematics, how can you be certain you are counting the same thing? Surely you end up checking the numerical proof in any case? Doesn't that make the story proof redundant?","['proof-explanation', 'proof-writing', 'probability']"
4804345,When to use Poisson distribution?,"I'm still very confused regarding when to use probability distributions. For instance, this is the assumptions to use Poisson distribution, according to Wikipedia: k is the number of times an event occurs in an interval and k can take values 0, 1, 2, ... The occurrence of one event does not affect the probability that a second event will occur. That is, events occur independently. The average rate at which events occur is independent of any occurrences. For simplicity, this is usually assumed to be constant, but may in practice vary with time. Two events cannot occur at exactly the same instant; instead, at each very small sub-interval, either exactly one event occurs, or no event occurs. Does that mean that I can assume that any event that follow this assumptions follow a Poisson distribution? If that is the case, why do so many books have exercises mentioning ""assume that ... follow a Poisson distribution""? Isn't that unnecessary? For instance: Let's say I work in a call-centre and I observe that I have 2 calls in the first hour, 3 in the second, 10 in the fourth, 5 in the fifith...

4804362,An inductive proof for the Heine-Borel theorem in $\mathbb{R}^n$,"The Heine-Borel theorem for $\mathbb{R}^n$ states that a subset $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is closed and bounded if and only if it is compact . (A set is said to be compact if every open cover of the set has a finite sub-cover). The standard method to show that closed- and boundedness implies compactness starts by enclosing $K$ in a box, and continually bisecting it until some or other contradiction is obtained. I have an alternative approach, but I am not entirely sure it works, and I would like to know if it seems possible to extend this to an arbitrary metric space (by replacing closed and bounded by sequentially compact) beyond that, I think its interesting that an inductive proof for it exists, so here it is: Firstly, it is sufficient to prove that every closed ball centered at $0$ is compact, since one can always enclose a bounded set $K$ inside such a closed ball of radius $r$ , $U(r)$ , and append to any cover of $K$ the set $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus K$ , and finding a finite subcover of the new cover is then equivalent to finding a finite subcover of the original cover. The base case is trivial since $\mathbb{R}^{0}=\{0\}$ has only compact subsets. If we then assume that this theorem holds in $\mathbb{R}^k$ , we will show that it holds in $\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ . Now let $U(r)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ be the closed ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin, and let $G$ be a cover for $U(r)$ . Then we say that $l\in \mathbb{R}^+$ is reached if there is some finite subset $G'$ of $G$ such that $$U(l) \subseteq \bigcup G'  $$ Now define $w$ as supremum of those $l\leq r$ which are reached. Now we assume that $w<r$ and obtain a contradiction. Note that since $$\partial U(w) \subseteq U(r) \subseteq \bigcup G $$ We have that $\partial U(w)$ is covered by $G$ . But $\partial U(w)$ is a $k$ -dimensional sphere, so it's upper (inclusive) hemisphere is homeomorphic to the closed ball in $\mathbb{R}^k$ , which is compact by assumption, so there is a finite subset of $G$ which covers the upper hemisphere of $\partial U(w) $ , the same is of course true for the lower hemisphere, so there is a finite subset of $G$ , call it $G_0$ , which covers $\partial U(w) $ . It is then easy to show that $G_0\cup G'$ , where $G'$ is a finite subset of $G$ , covers an open ball with a radius larger than $w$ (the proof for this is included at the end) and thus it covers a closed ball with a radius larger than $w$ , which is a contradiction, since $w$ was assumed to be the supremum of reached radii. Some of my questions are, is this a known proof? Is it correct? Proof that an open ball of radius larger than $w$ is covered by a finite subset of $G$ : To see why, it is sufficient to show that there is some $\delta>0$ such that for any $x\in\partial U(w)$ , the open ball of radius $\delta$ is contained in some member of $G_0$ . Suppose this is not true, then for any $\delta>0$ there is some $x\in\partial U(w)$ such that the open ball of radius $\delta$ is not contained in any member of $G_0$ , we can in particular take the convergent sequence of $\delta_n=\frac{1}{n}$ , which induces a sequence $(x_n)$ with elements in $\partial U(w)$ , but because of sequential compactness, this sequence converges to some point $x_0\in\partial U(w)$ but this is a contradiction since $x_0$ is contained in some open ball of radius $\delta_0$ (because $G_0$ is an open cover for $\partial U(w)$ ) and so eventually the $x_n$ 's will be within $\frac{\delta_0}{2}$ of $x_0$ , but then each $x_n$ beyond this point is contained in an open ball of radius $\frac{\delta_0}{2}$ , a contradiction, so there is some $\delta>0$ such that every point in $\partial U(w)$ is contained in the open ball of radius $\delta$ around that point. A routine application of the triangle inequality then shows that for any $|\varepsilon|\leq \frac{\delta}{2}$ we have $$\partial U(w+\varepsilon) \in \bigcup G_0$$ Since there is some finite subset $G'\subseteq G$ such that $$U\left(w-\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\subseteq \bigcup G' $$ So $G'\cup G_0$ covers $U(w+\frac{\delta}{2})$ which is the contradiction we required in the original proof","['induction', 'solution-verification', 'metric-spaces', 'real-analysis']"

To be a subspace, we must have the zero vector. As far as I know, the zero vector is always a fixed point because $f(0) = 0$ . We also need to have that it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
After reading on Wikipedia, it seems an endomorphism is linear. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomorphism That means we can use $f(v + u) = f(v) + f(u)$ because as said it is a linear map. If it is linear, we can also use $f(\alpha v) = \alpha f(v)$ . Because they are fixed points, we have $f(v) = v, f(u) = u$ . So we have $f(v + u) = f(v) + f(u) = v + u$ and $f(\alpha v) = \alpha f(v) = \alpha v$ . So $v + u$ and $\alpha v$ are also fixed points, so it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. Is this correct ? I need your feedback because we have no solutions so I have no idea if what I did is even correct EDIT: I was actually especially unsure about the endomorphism part. Because if we use the linear property of endomorphism, then this seems too easy. We are basically just referring to a property of the function, it seems to me we aren't directly proving something.

With the notations of the figure, (2) can be given the form : $$\cos \theta = \frac{\left(\tfrac12(b+d)-\tfrac12(a+c)\right)^2-\left(\tfrac12(a-c)\right)^2-\left(\tfrac12(b-d)\right)^2}{2\tfrac12(a-c)\tfrac12(b-d)}$$ Different simplifications yield : $$\cos \theta = \frac{(a-b)(c-d)+(b-c)(c-a)}{(a-c)(b-d)}$$ $$\cos \theta = \underbrace{[A,D;B,C]}_{\frac{r}{r-1}}-\underbrace{[B,A;C,D]}_{\frac{1}{1-r}}$$ (where $r$ denotes cross-ratio $[A,C;B,D]$ ). Therefore, we have : $$\cos \theta = \frac{r}{r-1}-\frac{1}{1-r}= \frac{r+1}{r-1}= \frac{1+\tfrac{1}{r}}{1-\tfrac{1}{r}}.$$ From there, one can deduce formula (1) as a consequence of the following classical formula (see here ) : $$\cos \theta = \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} \ \text{where} \ t=\tan(\tfrac{\theta}{2}).$$","['projective-geometry', 'geometry', 'reference-request', 'cross-ratio', 'trigonometry']"
