2990193,Can you determine a set of values from a set of distinct sums,"Consider an array of positive integers $A$ of length $n$ . Now consider the set of sums of all the contiguously indexed subarrays of $A$ . For example if $A = (1,3,5,6)$ then the set would be $S_A = \{1,3,5,6,4,8,11,9,14,15\}$ . If the sums of all contiguously indexed subarrays are distinct (as they are in the example above), does
  the set of these sums uniquely specify the set of integers in the array the sums were
  calculated from? We can certainly compute the smallest element in the original array as it is the smallest element in $S_A$ .  Similarly there must be a value in the original array which is the largest value in $S_A$ minus the second largest. To show one of the subtleties of this problem, consider $A = (1, 6, 2, 3)$ and $S_A = \{1, 6, 2, 3, 7, 8, 5, 9, 11, 12\}$ .  We can immediately tell from $S_A$ that $1$ occurs somewhere in $A$ . Similarly we can tell that $2$ occurs somewhere in $A$ .  But what can we tell about $3$ ?  If $1$ and $2$ were next to each then as $1+2=3$ we would know that $3$ can't be in $A$ . But if $1$ and $2$ are not next to each in $A$ then we know $3$ must be in $A$ .  How do we tell which case we are in? The answer turns out to be NO . Take $A = (4, 6, 5, 2, 1)$ and $B = (3, 8, 2, 4, 1)$ . We have that $S_A = S_B$ but the set of elements in $A$ and $B$ are distinct.","['elementary-number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'information-theory']"
2990263,Question about a function that is a ratio of gamma functions and appears to be strictly increasing for $x\ge 2$,I was surprised to discover that the following function appears to be strictly increasing for $x \ge 2$ : $$f(x) = \frac{\Gamma(x+1)}{\Gamma(\frac{x}{2}+1)\Gamma(\frac{x}{3}+1)\Gamma(\frac{x}{5}+1)}$$ when I tested out different values of $x$ using Excel. I had assumed that it would be decreasing since $x < \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{5}$ . I wanted to verify this is true by checking the derivative. It seemed to me that the right way to do this is to use this series of the digamma function so that: $$\frac{d}{dx}\left(\ln \Gamma(x+1) - \ln \Gamma(\frac{x}{2}+1) - \ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{3}+1) - \ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{5}+1)\right) =$$ $$ \psi(x+1) - \frac{\psi(\frac{x}{2}+1)}{2} - \frac{\psi(\frac{x}{3}+1)}{3}-\frac{\psi(\frac{x}{5}+1}{5}=$$ $$\frac{\gamma}{6}+ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{-1}{30k+30}-\frac{1}{k+x+1} + \frac{1}{2k+x+2} + \frac{1}{3k+x+3} + \frac{1}{5k+x+5}\right)$$ It is not obvious to me that this derivative is greater than $0$ for $x \ge 2$ How would I complete the derivative to reach my conclusion about whether this function is strictly increasing or not for $x \ge 2$ ?,"['gamma-function', 'derivatives']"

2990351,"Show that the space of increasing, bounded function is not totally bounded w.r.t. $\sup$-norm","Here is the exercise that I got. Verify that the class $\mathcal{G} = \left\{ g: \mathbb{R} \to [0,1], g \text{ is increasing}\right\}$ is not totally bounded for the supremum norm on $\mathbb{R}$ . I am trying to prove this by constructing a counterexample (for a given $\epsilon > 0$ and some functions $g_1,\cdots,g_n$ ), but I don't know how. The rough idea I have is that, to construct $f$ such that $\|f - g_i\|_\infty > \epsilon$ for all $g_i$ 's. So maybe only at one point $x_i$ , $f$ and $g_i$ are far away. For example, maybe at point $x_1$ , $f$ is only close to $\max_i g_i$ and far away from $\min_i g_i$ , but at another point $x_2$ , $f$ is only close to $\min_i g_i$ but far away from $\max_i g_i$ , but I don't know how to formalize this, partly because I don't know how far is $\max_i g_i$ from $\min_i g_i$ . The picture in my head is that, if $g_i$ is like a increasing straight line, then I can consider $f = \frac{1}{2}$ , so $f$ and $g$ will be far away when $x$ is big or small. If $g$ is quite flat, I can take $f$ to be an increasing line. I am not sure if I am thinking correctly and how to proceed.

But $$\sin\left(x^n\right) = \Im\left[-e^{-ix^n}\right]$$ And so, n $$ I = \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin\left(x^n\right)\:dx = \Im\left[\int_{0}^{\infty} -e^{-ix^n}\:dx \right]= -\Im\left[\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\left(i^{\frac{1}{n}}x\right)^{n}}\:dx \right]$$ Applying a change of variable $u = i^{\frac{1}{n}}x$ we arrive at: \begin{align}
I &= -\Im\left[i^{-\frac{1}{n}}\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-u^{n}}\:du \right] \\
  &= -\Im\left[i^{-\frac{1}{n}}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)}{n} \right]\\
  &= \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)}{n}
\end{align} My area of concern is in the substitution. As $i^{-\frac{1}{n}} \in \mathbb{C}$ , I believe the limits of the integral should have been from $0$ to $i^{-\frac{1}{n}}\infty$ . Is that correct or not? I'm also struggling with bounds on $n$ for convergence. Is this expression valid for all $n\in\mathbb{R}$ Any guidance would be greatly appreciated","['integration', 'complex-analysis', 'proof-verification', 'complex-numbers']"

From which follows by symmetry: If $A_{i, j}^{-1}$ such that $j$ is even and $i =-1+j - 2 m$ with $m\in \cal N_0$ , then $A_{i, j}^{-1} = (-1)^m$ . All other $A_{i, j}^{-1} = 0$ .

2991289,Finding the norm of the operator $M_g : L_p \to L_p$ where $g \in L_{\infty}$,"Suppose $(X,\,\cal{A},\,\mu)$ is a measure space where $\mu$ is a finite measure, and $p \in (1,\,\infty)$ . Say that we take some $g \in L_{\infty}$ , and we define $M_g : L_p \to L_p$ by $$M_g (f) = fg.$$ Then I'd like to show that $||M_g|| = ||g||_{\infty}$ . I'm not absolutely sure this is true, but I think it is. I've shown that $||M_g|| \leq ||g||_{\infty}$ , which is pretty simple, but now I'd like to find a function $f\in L_p$ such that $$\frac{||M_g (f)||_p}{||f||_p} = ||g||_{\infty}.$$ Here's what I've got so far: Let $M=||g||_{\infty}$ , the essential supremum of $|g|$ . Then let $N$ be the subset of $X$ on which $|g(x)| < \frac{M}{2}$ . Now $0<\mu (N)<\mu(X)<\infty$ and $0<\mu(X\setminus N)<\infty$ too. These things follow from the definition of $M$ and the fact that $\mu$ is a finite measure. So define $f:X \to \mathbb{R}$ as $$
f(x) = \begin{cases} 
0 & x\in N \\
\frac{M}{|g(x)|(\mu(X \setminus N))^{\frac{1}{p}}} & x \in X \setminus N
\end{cases} .
$$ Then $$\begin{align} ||M_g (f)||_p ^p &= \int_{X\setminus N}  \frac{M^p}{\mu(X \setminus N)} d\mu\\
&= M^p ,\,\text{ so} \\
||M_g (f)||_p &= M. \end{align}$$ And we can easily show that $f \in L_p$ because $\frac{M}{|g(x)|}$ is not going to blow up when $|g(x)| \geq \frac{M}{2}$ . However, we don't have $||f||_p = 1$ , so we only have $||M_g (f)||_p = M$ , not $\frac{||M_g (f)||_p}{||f||_p} = M$ as we require. So the question is, can this example be tweaked easily to get a unit-normed $f$ satisfying $||M_g (f)||_p = M$ , or is the whole thing off track?","['measure-theory', 'operator-theory', 'lp-spaces']"

One of the closed sets is then $\overline{\{\eta_p\}} =\{ \eta_p , s_p\}$ , let me call the complement of this $U$ , which is an open set. The notes proceed to define two maps (where I have replaced $R = \mathbb{Z}$ in the notes) $\textrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \textrm{Spa}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z})$ , sending $\mathfrak{p}$ to the valuation $R \rightarrow \textrm{Frac}(R/\mathfrak{p}) \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ , and $\textrm{Spa}(\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \textrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ , sending a valuation to its kernel.

I have worked out that (which is possibly incorrect) the first map $\textrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \textrm{Spa}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z})$ sends $0$ to $\eta$ and $(p)$ to $s_p$ , and the second map $\textrm{Spa}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \textrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ sends $\eta \mapsto 0$ , and $s_p \mapsto (p)$ , and $\eta_p \mapsto 0$ . Remark: the notes finally proceed to claim that In particular, any open cover of $\textrm{Spa}(R,R)$ is refined by the pullback of an open cover of $\textrm{Spec}(R)$ which to me suggests that it's not simply a misprint on the notes, that's why I would like to clear up the confusion I am having.","['rigid-analytic-spaces', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'valuation-theory']"

It is easy to see that roots of $P$ are $1$ , $-1$ for some special cases, and complex not real roots $z_i$ such that $\overline{z_i}$ is also a root, as $P$ is kind of reciprocal, $z$ root implies $\frac1z$ is also a root$.

As it is so, I don't understand where is the flaw in the following proof. If $\mathcal{F}$ is a finitely presented $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ , i.e. locally it there exists an exact sequence $$
\mathcal{O}_{X}^{n} \rvert_{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X}^{m} \rvert_{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{F} \rvert_{U} \rightarrow 0

$$ where $x \in X$ and the subscript means the stalk of the sheaf.
Therefore, if we have an exact sequence $$
0 \rightarrow \mathcal{G}' \rightarrow \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{G}'' \rightarrow 0

$$ Now, if $\mathcal{F}$ is locally free on rank $n$ , looking at the stalk at a point $x \in X$ and using what said before this exact sequence corresponds to the sequence $$
0 \rightarrow \mathcal{G}'^{\oplus n}_{x} \rightarrow  \mathcal{G}^{\oplus n}_{x} \rightarrow  \mathcal{G}''^{\oplus n}_{x}

Using the stars and bars method where there are $n-j$ stars and $k-2$ bars, we get that there are ${n-j+k-2} \choose {k-2}$ ways to find the number of ways $n-j$ balls can be randomly distributed into $k-1$ buckets.

The claim would follow from the definition of conditional expectation, if we can show that $$ \mathbb{E}[h(X_1, \ldots, X_{n+1}) \mathbf{1}_G] = \mathbb{E}[g(X_1, \ldots, X_{n}) \mathbf{1}_G], $$ for all $G \in \sigma(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ . What I tried so far is trying to expand the expectations and rewrite them with Fubini's theorem. Assuming the underlying probability space is $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ .
I thought I could rewrite with a restricted push forward $P_{|G}^{X_i}(A) = P(X_i^{-1}(A) \cap G)$ to get $$ \mathbb{E}[h(X_1, \ldots, X_{n+1}) \mathbf{1}_G] = \int_{(x_1, \ldots x_{n+1})\in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}} h(x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}) dP_{|G}^{X_1, \ldots, X_{n+1}} $$ All variables are $X_i$ independet so we can factor $dP_{|G}^{X_1, \ldots, X_{n+1}} = d \Pi_{i=1}^{n+1}  P_{|G}^{X_i}$ . $$ = \int_{(x_1, \ldots x_{n+1})\in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}} h(x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}) d \Pi_{i=1}^{n+1} P_{|G}^{X_i} = \int_{(x_1, \ldots x_{n})\in \mathbb{R}^{n}} \left(\int_{x_{n+1}\in \mathbb{R}} h(x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}) dP_{|G}^{X_{n+1}} \right) d \Pi_{i=1}^{n}  P_{|G}^{X_i}  $$ Now $P_{|G}^{X_{n+1}}(A) = P(X_{n+1}^{-1}(A)\cap G) = P(X_{n+1}^{-1}(A))P(G)$ , since $\sigma(X_{n+1})$ and $\sigma(X_1,\ldots, X_n)$ are independet. Since $\mathbb{E}[|h(X_1, \ldots, X_{n+1})|] < \infty $ Fubini applies and we get $$ \int_{(x_1, \ldots x_{n})\in \mathbb{R}^{n}} \left(\int_{x_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}} h(x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}) dP_{|G}^{X_{n+1}} \right) d \Pi_{i=0}^{n}  P_{|G}^{X_i} = P(G)\int_{(x_1, \ldots x_{n})\in \mathbb{R}} \left(\int_{x_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}} h(x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}) dP^{X_{n+1}} \right) d \Pi_{i=0}^{n}  P_{|G}^{X_i} $$ $$ = P(G) \int_{(x_1, \ldots x_{n}) \in \mathbb{R}^n} E[h(x_1, \ldots, X_{n+1})] d \Pi_{i=0}^{n}  P_{|G}^{X_i} = P(G) \int_{(x_1, \ldots x_{n})\in \mathbb{R}^n} g(x_1, \ldots, x_n)  d \Pi_{i=0}^{n}  P_{|G}^{X_i} = P(G)\mathbb{E}[g(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \mathbf{1}_G].   $$ So I the end I get $$ \mathbb{E}[h(X_1, \ldots, X_{n+1}) \mathbf{1}_G] = P(G)\mathbb{E}[g(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \mathbf{1}_G],$$ which is wrong according to the claim!

Some of the tiles intercepted by this line are perfectly cut in a half by it . Among these peculiar tiles, we highlight in blue the "" $\color{blue}{\text{fat rhombus}}$ "", and in green the "" $\color{green}{\text{thin rhombus}}$ "". Let us focus only the peculiar tiles which are cut in a half by the line. We can consider the blue tiles as $\color{blue}0$ s and the green tiles as $\color{green}1$ s. Therefore, if we collect these tiles from left to right, we obtain the binary sequence $$\color{blue} 0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0.$$ These $16$ terms are naturally too few for investigating the structure of the sequence. However, we can enlarge the Penrose tiling. Therefore, we now inflate the tiling up to $8$ generations. We need an even number of generations in order to keep the same central structure and, therefore, to obtain a binary sequence that contains the previous one, the one composed of only $16$ terms. Performing the same operation as before on the $8$ -generations $P3$ tiling, we find: which corresponds to the binary sequence $$\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\underline{\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0},$$ $$\underline{\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0},\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{blue}0,\color{green}1,\color{blue}0.$$ If we submit this sequence (42 terms, the underlined ones belong to the previous sequence of $16$ ) to the OEIS , we find that they match with the entry A221150 , i.e. with the terms of a generalized Fibonacci word , meaning that there could be a strong relation between this Penrose tiling and the Fibonacci word fractal , illustrated below. (The intuition would suggest me that the empty, squared substructures of the fractal should correspond to the structures with central pentagonal symmetry in the tiling). My conjecture is that the match between the binary sequence obtained from the Penrose tiling and the one related to the Fibonacci word fractal must keep independently on the (even) number of generations. I believe that, if the conjecture is true, the reason should be related to the Golden ratio (which is at the base of both these mathematical objects). However, I cannot provide a proof of such conjecture. Therefore I thank you very much for any comment, suggestion or reference which might help me to explain such (beautiful) connection.

We do this by extending the range of interest to $â2 \lt x \le 2$ in such a way that $f(x)=f(-x)$ and then letting $f(x+4k) = f(x)$ , where $k$ is any integer. This is shown in ï¬gure 12.5. Now we have an even function of period 4. The Fourier series will faithfully represent $f(x)$ in the range, $â2 \lt x \le 2$ , although not outside it. Firstly we note that since we have made the specified function even in $x$ by extending the range, all the coeï¬cients $b_n$ will be zero. Where $$b_n=\frac{2}{L}\int_{x_0}^{x_0+L}f(x)\sin\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right)dx\tag{12.5}$$ similarly $$a_n=\frac{2}{L}\int_{x_0}^{x_0+L}f(x)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right)dx\tag{12.6}$$ where $x_0$ is arbitrary but is often taken as $0$ or $-\frac{L}{2}$ and $L$ is the period of $f(x)$ . Now we apply $(12.5)$ and $(12.6)$ with $L = 4$ to determine the remaining coefficients: $$a_n=\frac{2}{4}\int_{-2}^{2}x^2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{4}\right)dx=\frac{4}{4}\int_{0}^{2}x^2\cos\left(\frac{\pi nx}{2}\right)dx$$ The textbook then goes on the evaluate the Fourier series for $x^2$ on $]0,2]$ (which I won't go through here as that is not what this question is about). The following related question I asked on ""Chegg Study"" website is here : Show that the Fourier series of $f(x)=\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$ for $-\pi\lt x \lt \pi$ is given by $$f(x)=\frac{2}{\pi}+\frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}\cos(nx)}{4n^2 - 1}$$ So my attempt at the finding the Fourier series for $\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$ on the interval $-\pi \lt x \lt \pi$ is by using the same method for the previous case $f(x) = x^2$ above. Since $\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$ is not periodic on $-\pi \lt x \lt \pi$ , $\,$ I will extend the interval to $-2\pi \lt x \lt 2\pi$ A plot of the extended function is shown below: Then by $(12.6)$ , $$\begin{align}a_n &=\frac{2}{L}\int_{x_0}^{x_0+L}f(x)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right)dx \\&=\frac{2}{4\pi}\int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi}\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{4\pi}\right)dx\\&=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi}\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{nx}{2}\right)dx\\&=0\end{align}$$ and this has been verified here by Wolfram Alpha. But according to this answer given by ""Chegg Study"" website which gives the correct answer but the author does not extend the range of integration or change the argument of the cosine. So basically the author does not make the function periodic. Now it was my understanding that the Dirichlet conditions for convergence demand that a function must be periodic. Are the Dirichlet conditions wrong then? Finally, my question is; why did the limits of integration need to be changed in the first example I gave, $f(x)=x^2$ , but not for the second example of $f(x)=\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$ ? I have researched this topic extensively in order to find an answer, here is a short extract from ""Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences"", third edition by Mary L. Boas, Section 8, page 360 , The method used in the $x^2$ and $\cos(x/2)$ case was general and did not specify any restrictions on the function being extended. So, put in another way, is there some kind of rule that says extending a trigonometric function to a full period is always forbidden since integrating over the period will be zero?","['integration', 'fourier-analysis', 'trigonometric-integrals', 'fourier-series', 'trigonometry']"
2993298,General solution ODE,"Consider the following ODE, defined on the interval I = $\mathbb{R}$ , $$\frac{d^3 y}{dx^3}+\frac{dy}{dx}=x$$ and its homogeneous differential equation, $$\frac{d^3 y}{dx^3}+\frac{dy}{dx}=0$$ whose characteristic polynomial yields the roots $\lambda_{1} = 0$ , $\lambda_{2} = i$ and $\lambda_{3} = -i$ , each with multiplicity 1. At it this point, there is a fundamental system of complex solutions, $(\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}, \phi_{3}) = (1, e^{ix}, e^{-ix})$ and a fundamental system of real solutions, $(\psi_{1}, \psi_{2}, \psi_{3}) = (1, cos(x), sin(x))$ . Upon applying the undetermined coefficients method, I've come up with a particular solution for the original ODE, $\eta_{p}(x) = \frac{x^2}{2}$ . Since the coefficients of the given ODE are all real numbers, what is the form of the general solution? Should it be $\psi (x) = \eta_{p} + c_{1} +  c_{2}cos(x) +c_{3}sin(x)$ or rather $\phi (x) = \eta_{p} + c_{1} +  c_{2}e^{ix} +c_{3}e^{-ix}$ ? And, in each case, are $c_{1},c_{2},c_{3} \in \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ ? Thank you kindly.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
2993325,Rates of change,"Iâm having some trouble with part c) of the following questions, a) What is the rate of change of the area A of a square with respect to its side x? b) What is the rate of change of the area A of a circle with respect to its radius r? c) Explain why one answer is the perimeter of the figure but the other answer is not. So, knowing that if we have a square with side length $x$ , then the area of the square as a function of its side is $A(x)=x^2$ . The perimeter as a function of the side is $P(x)=4x$ . And the rate of change of the area wrt its side is $\frac{dA}{dx}=2x$ . With a circle, the area as a function of the radius is $A(r)=\pi(r^2)$ . And the rate of change of the area wrt its radius is $\frac{dA}{dr}=2\pi(r)$ . The circumference as a function of the radius is also $C(r)=2\pi(r)$ . Therefore itâs the circle thatâs the figure with the rate of change of the area wrt its radius equal to its perimeter, and what I saw was that the square had a rate of change of area wrt its side equal to half the perimeter of the square, $\frac{dA}{dx}=2x=\frac{4x}{2}$ . I inscribed a circle in a square with radius equal to half the squareâs side length and went through the same work and then arrived at this, $A(r)=\pi(\frac{x}{2})^2=\frac{\pi}{4}x^2$ and $C(\frac{x}{2})=2\pi(\frac{x}{2}$ , and that $\frac{dA}{dr}=\frac{\pi}{2}x$ . Somehow in this example, I donât think itâs correct because the same fact about the rate of change of area wrt radius being equal to perimeter doesnât hold. I appreciate any help in explaining this, thank you.","['calculus', 'derivatives']"
