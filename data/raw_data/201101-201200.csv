3949524,Compare $\ln(\pi)$ and $\pi-2$ without calculator,"Unlike the famous question of comparing $e^\pi$ and $\pi^e$ , which I solved almost instantly, I am stuck with this problem.  My thought was the following. Since exponential function is order-preserving, we exponentiate both terms and get $\pi$ and $e^{\pi-2}$ .  Then we study the function $f(x) = e^{x-2} - x$ or the function $g(x) = \frac{e^{x-2}}{x}$ , and compare them with zero and one respectively.  I tried both.  But both involve solving the equation $$e^{x-2} = x.$$ I tried Lagrange error terms and have $$f(x) = -1 + \frac{(x-2)^2}{2!} + R_2(x-2),$$ where $$\frac{(x-2)^3}{3!} \le R_2(x-2) \le \frac{e^{x-2}}{3!} (x-2)^3.$$ It is easy to see that the equation have a root between $3$ and $2 + \sqrt2$ .  But I don't know how close it is to $\pi$ .  It is to provide some lower bounds since we can plug in some values and calculate to show that $f(x) > 0$ for such values.  But for the upper bound, it is hard to calculate by hands since it has the $e^{x-2}$ factor.  At my best attempt by hand, I showed that $f(3.15) > 0$ .  All it entails is that for all $x \ge 3.15$ , $e^{x-2}$ is greater than $x$ .  But it tells nothing about the other side. Then I looked at the calculator and find that $e^{\pi-2} < \pi$ . I also tried Newton-Raphson iteration, but it involves a lot of exponentiation which is hard to calculate by hand and also involves approximation by themselves.  And I don't know how fast and close the iteration converges to the true root of the equation. Any other hint for comparing these two number purely by hand?","['calculus', 'approximation', 'numerical-methods']"
3949538,Number of arbitrary constants in an ODE,"Consider the general solution of a differential equation- $$y=(C_1+C_2)\cos(x+C_3)+C_4\exp(x)+C_5$$ Without differentiating this equation and finding the differential equation for it, how can we say what the order of that DE is. Ofcourse, we can always count the number of arbitrary constants, which in this case I think are $4$ (since $C_1+ C_2$ is just one ). But my textbook says that the DE has order $3$ . Am I missing something? I think my mistake is in not absorbing one more constant, which I tried doing in the following way- $$y=K (\cos C_3 \cos x-\sin C_3 \sin x)+C_4\exp(x)+C_5$$ and then we can also absorb the cosine and sine of $C_3$ . But even here, it appears to me that we still have $4$ constants.

3949632,Moving exterior differential/derivative inside a wedge product,"Assumptions : Let $M$ be smooth $m$ -manifold. (If needed: Let $M$ be orientable and then oriented. Let $M$ be compact. Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold.) Let $\Omega^jM$ be the set of smooth $k$ -forms on $M$ , for $j=0, 1, ..., m$ . Let $d_j: \Omega^jM \to \Omega^{j+1}M$ be exterior differential / derivative on $\Omega^jM$ (based on $d: \Omega(M) \to \Omega(M)$ , with $\Omega(M)$ $:= \bigoplus_{j=0}^{m} \Omega^jM$ ).

Question 2 : In general, can we just move exterior differential/derivative through wedge products and just multiply $(-1)^{\text{something}}$ ? Question 3 : In anything above, are we assuming any additional things on $M$ like orientable/oriented/compact/Riemannian? Question 4 : If no to question 1, then do each of the 2 forms at least have equal integrals, i.e. the values we get when we plug each into $\int_M$ are equal? Here, we now suppose $M$ is orientable and then oriented and I guess compact (otherwise I guess we have to assume the forms have compact support or something). Context : This comes from some definitions and propositions leading to Hodge decomposition theorem, including the definition of Hodge star operator, but I'm trying to see if I understand the non-Hodge parts correctly. ( $\gamma$ is actually the image of some $\beta \in \Omega^{k+1}M$ under the Hodge-star operator.)","['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'derivatives', 'differential-forms', 'exterior-algebra']"

3949776,"Equivalency between a ""mixed modular equation"" of Gauss and a later theorem of Ramanujan.","In p. 476 of volume 3 of Gauss's collected works, appear several interesting identities on Jacobi theta functions which were used by the czech mathematician Karel Petr in an 1904 article "" Bemerkung zur einer Gausschen Formel über die Thetafunktionen ""  to derive relations giving the number of representations of a number $N$ by three quaternary quadratic forms: $x^2 + y^2 + 9z^2 + 9u^2$ , $x^2+y^2+z^2+9u^2$ , $x^2+9y^2+9z^2+9u^2$ . The identities by Gauss are: $$(\frac{3P^2-P^0\cdot P^0}{2})^2= p^4-4(\frac{pqr}{2})^{\frac{4}{3}}$$ $$(\frac{3Q^2-Q^0\cdot Q^0}{2})^2=q^4+4(\frac {pqr}{2})^{\frac{4}{3}}$$ where the relevant quantities are defined to be: $$P(x^3,1)=P , P(x,1)=p, P^0=P(x^{\frac{1}{3}},1)$$ $$Q(x^3,1)=Q , Q(x,1)=q, Q^0 = Q(x^{\frac{1}{3}},1)$$ $$R(x^3,1)=R , R(x,1)= r$$ and the three functions $P(x,y),Q(x,y),R(x,y)$ are equivalent to Jacobi's theta functions $\vartheta_3,\vartheta_4,\vartheta_2$ and defined to be: $$P(x,y)=1+x(y+\frac{1}{y})+x^4(y^2+\frac{1}{y^2})+x^9(y^3+\frac{1}{y^3})+...$$ $$Q(x,y)= 1-x(y+\frac{1}{y})+x^4(y^2+\frac{1}{y^2})-x^9(y^3+\frac{1}{y^3})+...$$ $$R(x,y)=x^{\frac{1}{4}}(y^{\frac{1}{2}}+y^{-\frac{1}{2}})+x^{\frac{9}{4}}(y^{\frac{3}{2}}+y^{-\frac{3}{2}})+x^{\frac{25}{4}}(y^{\frac{5}{2}}+y^{-\frac{5}{2}})+...$$ To see the equivalency between Gauss's notation and Jacobi's theta functions, look at the post Interpretation of a certain general theorem used by Gauss in his work on theta functions. . User Paramanand Singh helped me understand the meaning of Gauss's identities and remarked that they are essentialy a ""mixed modular equation"" which connects theta functions of $x^{\frac{1}{3}},x,x^3$ (or, equivalently, $\tau,\tau^3,\tau^9$ ), and said that Ramanujan also gave this modular equation. According to Paramanand Singh's comments, the following identity (from p. 142 of the book "" pi and the AGM "") of Ramanujan is equivalent to Gauss's: $$\frac{\theta_3(q)}{\theta_3(q^9)} - 1 = (\frac{\theta_3^4(q^3)}{\theta_3^4(q^9)}-1)^{\frac{1}{3}}$$ However, he didn't provide proof of equivalency. Therefore, it's not certain this is the desired identity of Ramanujan, and it's not even certain that Ramanujan stated an equivalent identity at all. Therefore, my questions are: Can anyone familiar with Ramanujan's results on mixed modular equations say which of Ramanujan's theorems is equivalent to Gauss's identities? and where can i find the relevant fragment of Ramanujan's writings on the internet? Can someone also give a proof of equivalency between Ramanujan's theorem and Gauss's identities? this doesn't have to be a proof of correctness of Gauss's identities (which can be quite complicated), just a proof of equivalency to Ramanujan's theorem.","['complex-analysis', 'theta-functions', 'math-history']"
3949835,"If $\mathcal{L}$ is an invertible sheaf on $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$, then is the restriction to the fibers constant?","Let $X$ be a Noetherian regular scheme, and $\mathcal{E}$ a locally free sheaf of rank $n+1\geq 2$ on $X$ . Let $\pi:\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})\to X$ be the natural morphism. Then for every $x\in X$ , the fiber of $\pi$ over $x$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}_{k(x)}^n$ .

Then is it true that $x\mapsto n_x$ is constant? How could one prove this elementarily? Some thoughts: if $U=\operatorname{Spec}A$ is an affine open subset which trivializes $\mathcal{E}$ , then $\pi^{-1}(U)\cong \mathbb{P}_A^n$ .

3949949,Question regarding second derivatives and maximums. Justifying a specific part,"Note: My question is regarding the bolded parts. Read those and my explanation below to see what I am asking. Let $f$ be a real-valued function on an open subset $U$ of $R$ that is twice differentiable at $x_0 \in U$ . Show that if $f'(x_0) = 0$ and $f''(x_0) < 0$ , then the restriction of $f$ to some open ball of center $x_0$ attains a maximum at $x_0$ . Here is my proof To show there is a maximum, we want to show that $f(x) < f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0) \ \forall x \neq x_0, x_0 \in U$ Case 1.) Assume $x < x_0$ . Applying the Mean Value Theorem on the interval $[x,x_0], \exists c \ where \ x < c < x_0 \ s.t.$ $f(x_0) - f(x) = f'(c)(x_0 - x)$ $f(x) = f(x_0) - f'(c)(x_0 - x)$ $f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(c)(x - x_0)$ Since $f''(x) < 0 \forall x \in U, f'(x)$ must be decreasing. Since we know from the MVT that $c < x_0$ , we can put these results together to have. $f'(x_0) < f'(c)$ Multiplying this by $x - x_0$ (which is negative, so flip the inequality), $f'(c)(x - x_0) < f'(x_0)(x - x_0)$ Adding $f(x_0)$ to both sides, $f(x_0) + f'(c)(x - x_0) < f(x_0) + f'(x)(x - x_0)$ The left side is $f(x)$ $f(x) < f(x_0) + f'(x)(x - x_0)$ as desired. Case 2.) Assume $x_0 < x$ . Using the MVT on the interval $[x_0,x], \exists d \ where \ x_0 < d < x_0 \ s.t.$ $f(x) - f(x_0) = f'(c)(x - x_0)$ $f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(c)(x - x_0)$ Similar to before, $f''(x) < 0$ means $f'(x)$ is decreasing. We know from this application of MVT that $x_0 < c$ Therefore, $f'(c) < f'(x_0)$ Multiplying by $x - x_0$ (positive this time) $f'(c)(x - x_0)) < f'(x_0)(x - x_0)$ Adding $f(x_0)$ , $f(x_0) + f'(c)(x - x_0) < f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)$ The left side is $f(x)$ $f(x) < f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)$ still holds. So we have shown that $\forall x \in U \ s.t. \ x \neq x_0$ , the function will be concave down. Therefore, it has a maximum at $x_0$ I bolded the parts that were unclear. My professor told me that this is not necessarily true. The function will admit a negative second derivative at $x_0$ , but not in the entire neighborhood. He said in this case, what I did is correct, but he said it is not obvious as to why. He said I have to say something about why I can make that claim. Can someone help me figure out what I can say to make that part clear? I'm not seeing it right now.
Edit: I am thinking it maybe due to the fact that I'm claiming this happens on all of R. So like, the neighborhood wouldn't really matter? But then again, I feel like that would be trivial, so I don't think he would ask the question. I think I just defined it that way. I'm really not sure. Please, any help is appreciated!

3950347,"Question about the proof of Theorem D.5, Introduction to Smooth Manifolds by Lee","I am trying to understand the proof of the following theorem from Lee's ""Introduction to Smooth Manifolds"": The following statement is in the proof: Question: What I don't see is how $\frac{2\epsilon e^{CT}}{E}\cdot(e^{ET}-1)$ can be made as small as desired by choosing $h$ and $\tilde{h}$ sufficiently small. How does the expression depend on $h$ and $\tilde{h}$ ? To me it looks like an upper bound. The only idea I have is the following: There is the following statement Let $k\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $k>\frac{2e^{CT}}{E}\cdot(e^{ET}-1)$ and $\tilde{\epsilon}:=\frac{\epsilon}{k}$ ,  and $\epsilon$ as above.
By the above statement I can find a $\tilde{\delta}$ such that $|y_{1}-y_{2}|<\tilde{\delta}$ implies \begin{align}
|\frac{\partial V^{i}}{\partial y^{k}}(y_{1})-\frac{\partial V^{i}}{\partial y^{k}}(y_{2})|<\tilde{\epsilon}=\frac{\epsilon}{k}
\end{align} Now the book says I would instead say ""Suppose that $h$ and $\tilde{h}$ are both less than $\frac{\tilde{\delta} e^{-CT}}{n}$ "". From here on I would proceed exactly as in the book to end up with the inequality \begin{align}
|\Delta_{h}(t,x)-\Delta_{\tilde{h}}(t,x)|\leq...\leq\frac{2\tilde{\epsilon} e^{CT}}{E}\cdot(e^{ET}-1)=\frac{2\epsilon e^{CT}}{k\cdot E}\cdot(e^{ET}-1)<\epsilon
\end{align} Does the statement ""choosing $h$ and $\tilde{h}$ sufficiently small  "" refer to the line "" $h$ and $\tilde{h}$ are both less than $\frac{\delta e^{-CT}}{n}$ "" ?

Here is the problem Let $K$ be a perfect field, $V/K$ be an affine variety, and let $G_K = \operatorname{Gal}(\overline{K}/K)$ . Prove that $K[V] = \{f\in\overline{K}[V]:f^\sigma=f\;\;\forall\sigma\in G_K\}$ . Here is the hint: the $\subset$ direction is clear. Conversely, if $F\in\overline{K}[X]$ is a representative of $f$ , the map $G_K\to\mathcal{I}(V)$ via $\sigma\mapsto F^\sigma-F$ is a 1-cocycle (indeed, if $f^\sigma=f$ in $\overline{K}[V]$ , then $F^\sigma-F\in\mathcal{I}(V)$ and $F^{\sigma\tau}-F = (F^{\sigma}-F)^\tau+ (F^\tau-F)$ ). It's the next point that I do not understand. Using $H^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+) = 0$ , I'm supposed to deduce that there is some $G\in\mathcal{I}(V)$ such that $F+G\in K[X]$ . I see that this would solve the problem, since in that case $f = (F+G)+\mathcal{I}(V)\in K[V]$ . Here's what I don't understand. Since $H^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+) = \frac{Z^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+)}{B^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+)}$ , so if $H^1 = 0$ , this means $Z^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+) = B^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+)$ , so the function $\sigma\mapsto F^\sigma-F$ out to come from a boundary. Question 1: It seems that $\sigma\mapsto F^\sigma-F$ is already in $B^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+)$ by definition, so how am I supposed to use the condition that $H^1 = 0$ ? Question 2: In addition, it seems to me that $H^1(G_K,\overline{K}^+)$ is also the wrong group to be looking at. We're treating $\overline{K}[X]$ as an additive $G_K$ -module, not $\overline{K}^+$ , so shouldn't I be looking at $H^1(G_K,\overline{K}[X])$ or $H^1(G_K,\overline{K}[V])$ ?

Here is a figure where $A\circ B$ equals a point $M$ and $A\circ C$ equals the point $N$ . For the first part I can easily show closure, abelianity, identity (which is $N$ ) and inverses.

The second part of the exercise is not clear to me at all. Has anyone seen this type of group construction before? I've been looking at literature and cannot find anything else. Update: The group part is done, and now we have to consider the cases when $\ell$ is a tangent and when $\ell$ is a secant.

\lim_{m \to \infty} m E \left[ \log\left( \frac{N+\frac{1}{2}}{m+1} \right) \right].

\lim_{m \to \infty} m E \left[ \log\left( \frac{N+\frac{1}{2}}{m+1} \right) \right]\le  \lim_{m \to \infty} m  \log\left( \frac{ E \left[ N  \right]+\frac{1}{2}}{m+1} \right)= \lim_{m \to \infty} m  \log\left( \frac{ m+\frac{1}{2}}{m+1} \right)=-\frac{1}{2}. 
\end{align} For the lower bound I tried to use the CLT argument from a related question in here : \begin{align}
m E \left[ \log\left( \frac{N+\frac{1}{2}}{m+1} \right) \right]= m E \left[ \log\left( \frac{N+\frac{1}{2}}{m+1} \right) | N \ge \frac{m}{k} \right] P[ N \ge \frac{m}{k} ]+ m E \left[ \log\left( \frac{N+\frac{1}{2}}{m+1} \right) | N < \frac{m}{k} \right] P[ N < \frac{m}{k} ]

\lim_{m\to \infty}m E \left[ \log\left( \frac{N+\frac{1}{2}}{m+1} \right) \right]= \lim_{m\to \infty}m E \left[ \log\left( \frac{N+\frac{1}{2}}{m+1} \right) | N \ge \frac{m}{k} \right] .

I have two choices. I can either run or take the moving sidewalk. The moving sidewalk moves at a constant speed of $2 \frac{m}{s}$ . If I’m running, I start out quick, but because I’m old I quickly tire and slow down. Equations for these situations are: $$M(t)=2t$$ $$R(t)=\sqrt{2000x}$$ I cannot run on the moving sidewalk because it’s too crowded, but I can to go onto or off of the moving sidewalk whenever I want to. Assume that I never recover my energy, so I can only have one burst of running. How can I get to my gate in less than $500$ s? Explain the process and determine the minimum time it takes me to reach the gate. If the moving sidewalk moved at $2.5$ m/s, what is the best strategy and how quickly can I reach the gate? If the moving sidewalk is moving at $2$ m/s, but running speed is modeled by $R(t) = 153(x2)^{\frac{1}{3}}$ , what is the best strategy and how long will it take me to reach the gate? For 1. I know that $M(t)$ is the distance traveled after $t$ seconds on the moving sidewalk. $R(t)$ is the distance traveled after t seconds running.
I'm going to spend some time running and some time on the sidewalk, so I need to find possible values of $t_{0}$ and $t_{1}$ such that $M(t_{0})+R(t_{1})=1000$ and $t_{0}+t_{1}<500$ . Then I am trying to minimize $t_{0}+t_{1}$ (the time it takes to get to your gate).
if you just run the whole way, or just take the sidewalk the whole way, you get there in $500$ seconds, so the problem is asking you to do better than that.
I'm just not sure how to translate this information into an equation. Once I can do #1 the #2, and#3 will be easy.

Conjecture : Let $n\geq 100$ and then define the sum : $$S(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{\operatorname{argtanh}\left(\frac{k}{k+1}\right)}$$ Then we have : $$\lceil{S(n)}\rceil\leq 2\pi(n)$$ Where we see the ceiling function and the prime counting function .Nicely the equality case is $n=100$ .
I have checked my conjecture with wolfram alpha up to $n=1000$ and extra values of $n$ up to $n=1000000$ Obviously I'm inspired by the prime number theorem and it's not a chance if I choose $\operatorname{argtanh}$ in my conjecture . I have several questions: Well first I would like to know if it's true for larger $n$ . Is my conjecture equivalent to other conjecture (stronger or weaker conjecture) .

An alternative way to view this problem is that there's an unknown Vandermonde matrix $V$ for which we have to solve $Vx=a$ given known $x,a$ . (Indeed, $x=(1,-1,1,-1,1,\ldots,1)^T$ .) Original context: I have a real symmetric tridiagonal matrix H with 0 on the diagonal, and it is also centrosymmetric. So, it looks something like $$

$$ For the $N\times N$ matrix, I want to fix $2k+1$ of the eigenvalues. If $2k+1=N$ , this is a standard symmetric inverse eigenvalue problem, but I want to consider smaller values of $k$ . You might formulate this generally, although I'm actually interested in the case where the eigenvalues are $0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\ldots \pm k$ . The remaining eigenvalues are unspecified. They have to occur in $\pm\lambda$ pairs, and I want the smallest (positive) value to be larger than $k$ . These will be determined by the additional constraint - that I want to fix the $N-1-2k$ central coupling strengths to be a specific set of values (again, in the specific case I'm looking at, I'm assuming they're all the same value $J$ , and that $J$ happens to be in a range that allows a solution. I'm deferring the problem of determining what that range might be). The way that I'm trying to approach this is to use some symmetry properties. If $S$ is the swap operator, we can evaluate $\text{Tr}(SH^k)$ both in terms of the eigenvalues of $H$ and in terms of the known coupling strengths. I then get a bunch of equations for my unknown eigenvalues which are those of the original problem statement. With those eigenvalues, I can run the standard inverse eigenvalue routine to determine the matrix $H$ . I've got some good numerical techniques for finding solutions based on this paper . I was just wondering if I could find solutions more directly.","['systems-of-equations', 'linear-algebra', 'polynomials', 'roots']"
3951500,Classical number theoretic applications of the $p$-adic numbers,"I am sure we can all agree that the $p$ -adic numbers are highly fascinating objects in their own right - just as the closely related theory of valuations. Having independently read up on the $p$ -adic numbers for a few weeks now, I have so far only seen one application of them to what I would call classical number theory - namely the proof given in Serre's Cours d'arithmétique that a natural number is expressible as the sum of $\leq 3$ squares if and only if it is not of the form $4^a(8b-1)$ for some $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ . Since I have a tendency to appreciate the value of the higher theories of mathematics in proportion to their applications to elementary number theory, I immediately found myself wondering if there are any other applications. So my question to the community is: What are the most delightful applications of the $p$ -adic numbers and the theory of valuations to elementary number theory? Many thanks. P.s.: I am aware that there are already several posts on the forum about the applications of the $p$ -adic numbers, but none that refers to elementary number theory specifically. Edit: I agree that I have been too vague in what I mean by ""elementary number theory"", so I will try to be a little more specific: By a classical ""elementary"" number theoretic proposition, I mean a number theoretic proposition that Fermat might have come up with. Thus, the above proposition about the sum of three squares is an elementary number theoretic proposition, as is e.g. Fermat's Last Theorem and the Twin Prime Conjecture, while e.g. the BSD Conjecture or the Class Number Problem are not. Edit 2: Thank you for all the answers below - they are all excellent! In case anyone should come up with another one, I should like to say that bonus-points are given for results that have so far only been proven using the theory of $p$ -adic numbers, or whose proof using $p$ -adic numbers is far more conceptual and insightful than the original / more elementary one.","['number-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'valuation-theory']"
3951544,Invertible matrix whos square is not invertible?,"Of course, this scenario is impossible for finite dimensional matrices. I am trying to understand what it means for an unbounded linear operator to have a well defined inverse, but the square of its inverse does not exist. It's pretty easy to find examples of this happening. Take the matrix $$M_{nm}=2\delta_{nm}-\delta_{n+1m}-\delta_{n-1m}$$ Defined for $n,m\geq 1$ . This has the inverse $M^{-1}_{nm}=\text{min}(n,m)$ . The square of the inverse obviously diverges and so does not exist. The square goes like $M^{-2}_{nm}\sim nm/3*N$ where $N$ is the size of the matrix. What does this mean for the matrix $M^2$ ? Does $M^2$ somehow pick up a zero eigenvalue that $M$ didn't have? Edit 1: I'd like to say also that $M$ itself can be said to have zero eigenvalues, with eigensequence $a_n=n$ , but if we define everything to be in the Hilbert space $l^2$ of finite norm sequences $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_n|^2<\infty$ , then those sequences don't belong to the space, hence why we are able to define an inverse. Perhaps theres something about the incompatibility of the linear operator $M$ with the Hilbert space? Edit 2: After playing around with this a little more, I've come to the conclusion that the operator $M^{-1}_{nm}=\text{min}(n,m)$ maps $l^2$ vectors to a different space (that I don't know), in the same sense that the derivative operator takes $x^{1/2}$ out of $L^2([0,1])$ . It just so happens that one of the problem $l^2$ vectors is $a^{(m)}_{n}=\delta_{mn}$ , hence why the norm $|M^{-1}a^{(m)}|^2=M^{-2}_{mm}=\infty$ . If this is the case, in what sense can we define $M^{-1}$ ? do we need to use a different basis other than $a^{(m)}_n$ ?","['hilbert-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

where $-2\le u\le 2$ and $-2\le v\le 2$ . Then I can parametrize the surface with a vector function as follows: $$\mathbf r(u,v)=\langle u, v ,4-u^2-v^2\rangle $$ Then $\mathbf r_u(u,v)=\langle 1,0,-2u\rangle,\>

Thus, using $$ u=r\cos\theta\qquad\text{and}\qquad v=r\sin\theta$$ the surface area is \begin{align*}
A&=8\int_0^{\pi/4}\int_0^{2\sec\theta}\sqrt{4r^2\cos^2\theta+4r^2\sin^2\theta+1}\ r\,dr\,d\theta\\

3951846,On the proof of The Bounded Convergence Theorem,"From the text Real Analysis by Royden, he gives the following proposition Proposition 8: Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of bounded measurable functions on a set of finite
measure $E$ . $$\text{If } \{f_n\}\to f \text{ uniformly on $E$, then } \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{E}f_n = \int_{E}f.$$ The proof is given as: Proof: Since the convergence is uniform and each $f_n$ is bounded, the limit function $f$ is
bounded. The function $f$ is measurable since it is the pointwise limit of a sequence of
measurable functions. Let $\epsilon>0$ . Choose an index $N$ for which $$\left|f-f_n\right|<\epsilon/\operatorname{m}\left(E\right)\text{ on $E$ for all $n\geq N$}.$$ By the linearity and monotonicity of integration and the preceding corollary, for each $n\geq N$ , $$\left|\int_{E}f - \int_{E}f_n\right| = \left|\int_{E}[f - f_n]\right|\leq\int_{E}\left|f-f_n\right|\leq [\epsilon/\operatorname{m}\left(E\right)]\cdot\operatorname{m}\left(E\right) = \epsilon.$$ Therefore $\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{E}f_n = \int_{E}f$ . My question is: How come if we switch bounded to uniformly bounded, and uniform convergent to pointwise convergent the proof no longer holds? Moreover, how come we can not longer say: Let $\epsilon>0$ . Choose an index $N$ for which $$\left|f-f_n\right|<\epsilon/\operatorname{m}\left(E\right)\text{ on $E$ for all $n\geq N$}.$$ Is this statement no longer true if $\{f_n\}\to f \text{ pointwise on $E$}$ ?","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

The indication that appears to me is: to calculate $f\in Y$ of minimum norm, find a function of the type $g(x)=sx+t\sin x$ such that $f\in Y$ is fulfilled if and only if $f-g\in Z^\perp$ where $Z=\textrm{Span}[x,\sin x]$ , that is, that $Y=g+Z^\perp$ is fulfilled.

However, I have been stuck proving the opposite inclusion $ B_* \subset \textrm{conv}(A)$ . Does anyone have any tips on how to show this inclusion? One idea that I have is to take the SVD of an arbitrary matrix $X \in B_*$ such that $X=U\Sigma V^T$ where the sum of the elements of the diagonal matrix $\Sigma \le 1$ . We also know that $U,V^T$ are orthonormal square matrices. However, I'm not sure where to go from there.","['nuclear-norm', 'convex-hulls', 'rank-1-matrices', 'matrices', 'convex-analysis']"
3951946,Why is a miracle happening on this double integral?,"I am trying to solve a double integral of the form $$\int_0^\infty du\int_0^\infty dx \frac{1}{x}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^{2n+1}f\left(\sqrt{x^2+u}\right),$$ where $f$ is a well-behaved even function that decays rapidly at infinity. The content of this question (and miracle) does not depend on the specific $f$ , as long as it is even and well behaved, but $f(t)=e^{-t^2}$ is a fine example. Note that since $1/x$ multiplies an odd function, the integrand is nonsingular as $x\to0$ . I would like to have a solution for a generic integer $n$ , in terms of the known quantities $f^{(m)}(0)$ (i.e., arbitrary $m$ th derivatives of $f$ evaluated at zero). Amazingly, such a solution seems to always exist (I have tested up to $n = 5$ ), but the method I am using is extremely tedious, relies on Mathematica, and results in infinite terms that miraculously cancel. So the question is, what's a more efficient and clear method to get the same result? Step 1: Evaluate all $2n+1$ derivatives. Step 2: Transform the first integral with the change of variables $u=y^2,du=2ydy$ . Step 3: Convert to polar coordinates. Step 4: Evaluate the $\theta$ -integral. Step 5: What remains is an integral of the form $\int_0^\infty dr\left(c_1\frac{1}{r^{p_1}}f^{(q_1)}(r) + \cdots + c_r r^{p_N}f^{(q_N)}(r)\right)$ . Some of the terms with powers of $x$ in the denominator are infinite, but integrating by parts on some terms always makes these cancel. The terms with positive powers of $x$ can be integrated by parts repeatedly until they become $\int_0^\infty dr f^{(m)}(r) = - f^{(m-1)}(0)$ . Steps 1–4 can be performed by Mathematica using the single line (here $n=2$ ): Integrate[

  2r Tan[\[Theta]] D[f[Sqrt[x^2 + u]], {x, 2*2 + 1}] /. {x ->

   Simplify], {\[Theta], 0, \[Pi]/2}] I invite you to copy/paste this line in, examine the output and verify what I have claimed in step 5. It may seem pointless for me to ask this question, given that I already have a method for getting to a solution; however, Mathematica starts taking a very long time to compute this even for $n=5$ , and even still the above line does not consider the final integrations by parts that make several more terms vanish and combine, so I think a better method is needed for both efficiency and understanding's sake.","['integration', 'multivariable-calculus', 'polar-coordinates']"

3952067,Why isn't every finite locally free morphism etale?,"I have been reading the notes here . There, a finite locally free morphism of schemes is defined as as a morphism of schemes $f: X \rightarrow Y$ which is finite and for which the sheaf $f_{*} \mathcal{O}_{X}$ is locally free as an $\mathcal{O}_{Y}$ -module. A finite etale morphism is then defined as a morphism of schemes $f: X \rightarrow Y$ which is finite locally free, and for which the fiber over any point $q \in Y$ is an etale $\kappa(q)$ -algebra. I am struggling to understand what the part about the fibers being etale algebras adds at all. It seems like every finite locally free morphism would trivially satisfy this. Take $f: X \rightarrow Y$ to be a finite locally free morphism of schemes. For any $q \in Y$ , choose an affine $\operatorname{spec}A$ around $q$ small enough so that $f_{*} \mathcal{O}_{X}$ is free, say of degree $d$ . Then since $f$ is finite, it is in particular affine, so the morphism looks locally like $\operatorname{spec}(A^{\oplus d}) \rightarrow \operatorname{spec}A$ . Then the fiber over $q$ is just $\operatorname{spec}(\kappa(q)^{\oplus d})$ . This seems to trivially be an etale $\kappa(q)$ -algebra, since tensoring with some algebraic closure $\Omega$ would give $d$ copies of $\Omega$ . Where is the flaw in my reasoning? Or is it just the case that every finite locally free morphism is etale? Further to this, the same notes say that for a finite etale morphism, the degree of the morphism at a point $q \in Y$ is the same as the cardinality of the fiber over $q$ . But again the above reasoning seems to show this for any finite locally free morphism. Where does etale come into it at all?","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

The total number of signs ( $+$ and $-$ ) is $a$ where $2^a < p < 2^{(a+1)}$ and total number of $2$ s inside the nested radical is $(a+1)$ The missing power of 2 is $+$ s and others are $-$ s What if the odd number is 57 or 149 or big numbers? The wonder is we can make the odd numbers as sums of 2^n in decreasing order For example if odd number is 57 then the cosine angle is $57 \over 2^7$ radians which can be derived as finite nested square roots of 2 as follows $57 = 2^6-7$ and $7 = 2^3-1$ and $\therefore 57 =  2^6-(2^3-1)$ Now $2\cos(\frac{57\pi}{2^7}) = \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}}}}$ or simply as $n\sqrt2(1-2+1-1+)$ $149 = 2^8-107$ and $107 = 2^7-21$ and $21 = 2^5-11$ and $11 = 2^4-5$ and $5 = 2^3-3$ and $3 = 2^2-1$ $\therefore 149 =  2^8-(2^7-(2^5-(2^4-(2^3-(2^2-1)))))$ Now $2\cos(\frac{149\pi}{2^9}) = \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2-\sqrt2}}}}}}}$ or simply as $n\sqrt2(2-1+4-)$ One more easier method that I tried as follows E.g $2\cos(\frac{3\pi}{2^3})$ = $\sqrt{2+2\cos(\frac{3\pi}{2^2}})$ = $\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{\pi}{2^2}})$ = $\sqrt{2-\sqrt2}$ $2\cos(\frac{5\pi}{2^4}) = \sqrt{2+2\cos(\frac{5\pi}{2^3}}) = \sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{3\pi}{2^3}}) = \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+2\cos(\frac{3\pi}{2^2}}}) = \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{\pi}{2^2}}}) = \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2-\sqrt2}}$ $\therefore$ for any odd number we can derive the finite nested square roots of 2 easily As it is too lengthy I'll restrict with 1 big number example For $2\cos(\frac{57\pi}{2^7}) = \sqrt{2+2\cos(\frac{57\pi}{2^6}}) = \sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{7\pi}{2^6}}) = \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+2\cos(\frac{7\pi}{2^5}}}) = \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+2\cos(\frac{7\pi}{2^4}}}}) = \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+2\cos(\frac{7\pi}{2^3}}}}}) = \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{\pi}{2^3}}}}}) = \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+2\cos(\frac{\pi}{2^2}}}}}}) = \sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}}}}$ Conclusion : For a given odd number $'p'$ in numerator of angle with corresponding denominator $'q'$ as $2^n$ in the angle as radians, satisfying $1 \over 4$ < $p \over q$ < $1 \over 2$ , the cosine angle can be represented as finite nested square roots of 2 These steps I have derived myself and verified the results.

My attempt $:$ Let $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} x^{(n)}$ be an absolutely summable series in $\ell^p.$ Let $x^{(n)} = \left (x_j^{(n)} \right )_{j \geq 0}.$ Need to show that $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} x^{(n)}$ converges in $\ell^p.$ Let $M = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \left \|x^{(n)} \right \|_p.$ Let $(y^{(n)})_{n \geq 1}$ be the sequence of partial sums of the series $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} x^{(n)}.$ So for each $n \geq 0$ we have $$y^{(n)} = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} x^{(k)} = \left (\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} x_j^{(k)} \right )_{j \geq 0} = \left (y_j^{(n)} \right )_{j \geq 0}.$$ where $y_j^{(n)} = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} x_j^{(k)}, j \geq 0.$ Now for each $j \geq 0$ consider the sequence $\left (z_j^{(n)} \right )_{n \geq 0}$ defined by $$z_j^{(n)} = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} \left |x_j^{(k)} \right |,\ n \geq 0.$$ Then it is easy to see that $\left (z_j^{(n)} \right )_{n \geq 0}$ is increasing and bounded above by $M$ for all $j \geq 0$ and hence it is convergent for all $j \geq 0.$ Let $z_j : = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} z_j^{(n)},\ j \geq 0.$ For each $n \geq 0$ define the sequence $\left |x^{(n)} \right | : = \left (\left |x_j^{(n)} \right | \right )_{j \geq 0}.$ Let $z^{(n)} : = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} \left |x^{(k)} \right | = \left (\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} \left |x_j^{(k)} \right | \right )_{j \geq 0} = \left (z_j^{(n)} \right )_{j \geq 0},\ n \geq 0.$ Then by Minkowski's inequality it follows that $$\left \|z^{(n)} \right \|_p \leq \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} \left \|x^{(k)} \right \|_p \leq M.$$ Now for each $j \geq 0$ we have $\left (z_j^{(n)} \right )_{n \geq 0}$ increases to $z_j.$ So by MCT it follows that $$\sum\limits_{j=0}^{\infty} z_j^p = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \sum\limits_{j=0}^{\infty} {z_j^{(n)}}^p = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left \|z^{(n)} \right \|_p^{p} \leq M^p.$$ This shows that $\|z\|_p \leq M,$ where $z = (z_j)_{j \geq 0}.$ Hence $z \in \ell^p.$ Now since $\left (z_j^{(n)} \right )_{n \geq 0}$ is convergent for each $j \geq 0,$ it follows that $\left (y_j^{(n)} \right )_{n \geq 0}$ is convergent for each $j \geq 0.$ Let $y_j = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} y_j^{(n)},\ j \geq 0.$ Let $y = (y_j)_{j \geq 0}.$ If we can prove that $y \in \ell^p$ and $\left \|y^{(n)} - y \right \|_p \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ then we are through. Now $$\left |y_j^{(n)} \right | \leq \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n} \left |x_j^{(k)} \right | = z_j^{(n)}.$$ Hence we have $$\left |y_j^{(n)} \right |^p \leq {z_j^{(n)}}^p.$$ Since $\left \|z^{(n)} \right \|_p \lt \infty$ it follows from DCT that $y \in \ell^p$ and $$\left \|y^{(n)} - y \right \|_p \to 0\ \text {as}\ n \to \infty.$$ Is my attempt correct at all?

3952798,Genericity of an induced projection map,"Let $X,Y$ be smooth manifolds, $S'$ a submanifold of $Y$ , and $f:\mathbb{R}\times X\to Y$ a smooth function. Generically, we have that $f$ is transverse to $S'$ , which implies that $S:=f^{-1}(S')$ is a smooth submanifold of $\mathbb{R}\times X$ . It comes with a projection map, namely the restriction of the projection on $\mathbb{R}$ to $S$ . My question is: Is there a generic property I can also ask $f$ to check in order for this projection to be a Morse function? So far analyzing this first transversality condition, I can describe the tangent space of $S$ , $$T_{(t,x)}S=\left\{(\dot{t},\dot{x})\in \mathbb{R}\times T_xX\,;\,(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}(\dot{x})+\dot{t}\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(t,x)\in T_{f(t,x)}S'\right\},$$ and thus if $(t,x)$ is a critical point of $\pi|_S$ , then every tangent vector of $S$ at $(t,x)$ is sent to $0$ by $d\pi_{(t,x)}$ , which amounts to say that $$T_{(t,x)}S=\left\{(0,\dot{x})\in \mathbb{R}\times T_xX\,;\,(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}(\dot{x})\in T_{f(t,x)}S'\right\}\simeq(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}^{-1}(T_{f(t,x)}S').$$ From this we can say that $f_t$ is not transverse to $S'$ , otherwise we would have a problem of dimension ( $T_{(t,x)}S$ would be 1 dimension less than expected). So by the transversality parametric theorem, I can conclude that the regular values of the projection are generic. But there is nothing about the critical values being non-degenerate, and I can even construct a counter-example where the transversality condition alone does not result in the projection being Morse: take $f:\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2$ given by $f(t,x)=(t,x)$ and $S'=g(\mathbb{R})$ with $g(x)=(x^3,x)$ . So I have to add something else, probably a transversality condition involving the 1-jet of $f$ , but I can't find it and every help will be much appreciated. Thanks for reading my question! Edit regarding Ted Shifrin's comment: Taking a metric on $S$ , the fact that $\pi$ is Morse translates as $\mathrm{grad}\,\pi$ is transverse to $0_{TS}$ , or again that for all $(t,x)\in S$ s.t. $d\pi_{(t,x)}=0$ , then $$\nabla\mathrm{grad}\,\pi:T_{(t,x)}S\to T_{(t,x)}S,(0,\dot{x})=\dot{x}\mapsto\nabla_{\dot{x}}\mathrm{grad}\,\pi$$ is onto. Since in coordinates, $\nabla_{\dot{x}}\mathrm{grad}\,\pi$ is given by $$\left(\dot{x}^i\partial_l\pi(\partial_ig^{lk}+g^{lj}\Gamma_{lj}^k)\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k},$$ this amounts to show that for all $\dot{y}=\dot{y}^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}$ s.t. $(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}(\dot{y})\in T_{f(t,x)}S'$ , there exists a $\dot{x}=\dot{x}^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$ s.t. $(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}(\dot{x})\in T_{f(t,x)}S'$ and $$\dot{x}^i\partial_l\pi(\partial_ig^{lk}+g^{lj}\Gamma_{lj}^k)=\dot{y}^k.$$ What bothers me from this writing is that I still can't see what property I could add to $f$ in order to this be verified (it will be as soon as $\det\left(\partial_l\pi(\partial_ig^{lk}+g^{lj}\Gamma_{lj}^k)\right)_{ik}\neq 0$ , but I think that this is equivalent to ask that $\mathrm{Hess}(\pi)_{(t,x)}$ is non-degenerate, which is simply the definition of $\pi$ being a Morse function ; and I don't manage to involve the condition $(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}(\dot{y})\in T_{f(t,x)}S'$ ).

To find the value of the integral, I chose to find the integral: $$\int_0^1f(x)d(g(x))-\int_0^1f(x)d(3x)$$ By definition of $g$ , this is: $$\int_0^1f(x)d(h(x))$$ Where $h(x)=g(x)-3x$ , so $h(x)=0$ for $x\in[0,1)$ and $h(1)=1$ Finding it by definition, if $\epsilon>0$ , and I chose the partition $P=\{0,1-\epsilon,1\}$ , then: $S(P,f,h)=f(0)(h(1-\epsilon)-h(0))+f(1-\epsilon)(h(1)-h(1-\epsilon))=f(1-\epsilon)=(1-\epsilon)^2$ From here, I could conclude that: $$\int_0^1f(x)d(h(x))=1$$ Is this correct? Because intuitively I thought it was going to be $0$ , or did I do something wrong?.","['integration', 'calculus', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"
3952843,Proving a floor function is injective/surjective [closed],"Closed . This question needs details or clarity . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 3 years ago . Improve this question Is the function $\lfloor x/2\rfloor$ injective or surjective? If so why? The domain is $\mathbb R$ and the co-domain is $\mathbb Z$ . I think it is not injective as if we take x to be $20$ and $y$ to be $21$ , we end up with $f(x)=10=f(y)$ , but $x$ is not equal to $y$ . I know that to check for surjection, we have to solve in terms of $x$ , but since this is a floor function, I'm not sure what to do with the floor symbol while solving for $x$ .

3952975,How can I solve this absolute value inequality: $|-2x|> \frac{-x}{2} -3$?,"$|-2x|> \frac{-x}{2} -3$ This inequality isn't from a textbook, I made it out because I felt like there must be some cases when the methods I learnt in class won't work. These are the methods I used and that I only know: First method $-2x>\frac{-x}{2}-3$ → $x<2$ $-(-2x)>\frac{-x}{2}-3$ → $x>-1.2$ Answer: $-1.2<x<2$ And after checking by substituting any number smaller than $2$ or bigger than $-1.2$ , I get correct answers. Second method $(|-2x|)^2 > (\frac{-x}{2}-3)^2$ Answer: $-1.2<x<2$ But this answer is wrong because looking at the graph I can see that the absolute value function is always above the straight line. The answers I get are true if the straight line had an absolute value sign too or because of the parts under the x-axis of functions $-2x$ and $-(-2x)$ that no longer exist because of the absolute value sign. So how can I solve this inequality without drawing? And how does I know that the answers I get are wrong or incomplete when solving anything similar?","['functions', 'absolute-value']"

3953105,"Soft question, limit of $n\mathbb{Z}$","I was trying to think of countable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ that were, in a sense, small. By that I mean how 'spread out' the terms were. I know this isn't at all concise, but for example, $3\mathbb{Z}$ is 'smaller' (in the manner described above) than say $2\mathbb{Z}$ . So this got me thinking, looking at specifically $n\mathbb{Z}$ , is there anything meaningful to talk about $\lim_{n\to\infty}{n\mathbb{Z}}$ ? Firstly I thought, does this even make sense? Is it just a meaningless thing to consider? What made intuitive sense is, if we consider the extended reals, that the limit is $\{-\infty,+\infty\}$ , but that just seemed somehow not quite right. Is there any resources available, or anything to talk about limits, or limits alike?","['limits', 'soft-question']"
3953136,"Which equilateral triangles does the P-hexiamond (the ""sphinx"") tile?","There's been lots of work investigating the polyominoes which can tile a square (equivalently, a rectangle). However, as far as I can tell there's been less investigation into the polyiamonds which can tile an equilateral triangle. Two obvious restrictions come to mind. First, the polyiamond has to actually fit into a corner - i.e., there is some 60-degree angle the tile covers the tip of without exceeding its bounds. Second, we have a simple coloring argument: the number of right-side-up and upside-down triangles in the tile can't be the same, because in an equilateral triangle there are more of one than the other. Applying these two conditions to all the polyiamonds on at most 4 triangles as listed e.g. here , every case is either immediately ruled out or can be easily seen to work for every triangle of a plausible side length (i.e., $s$ such that $s^2$ is a multiple of the number of triangles in the tile). For the pentiamonds, we have: C $5$ : Can't fit in the corner, ruled out. L $5$ : If placed in the corner, it leaves a $60$ degree angle void which must be filled by a piece in the same orientation, which repeats infinitely and never fits into the other corner of an equilateral triangle: P $5$ : Can be ruled out by a small amount of casework: there's only one way to place the first piece in the corner, and then a second triangle in the ""concave part"" of the piece can only be filled in one way, but placing those two pieces leaves a void that can't be filled. I $5$ : Very difficult; it turns out the answer is yes for all triangles with side length $5k\ge 30$ , as discussed in this MathOverflow thread . I'm interested in extending this to the hexiamond case. The two considerations outlined above rule out every piece but F $6$ and P $6$ . For F $6$ , I've managed to show that the tiles must join into parallelograms in a way that prevents them from ever lining up with a third side of an equilateral triangle. For P $6$ , however, things are more complicated. (Since it is a rep-tile , it can certainly tile an infinite triangular ""quadrant"" (hexant?).) Via an exhaustive search with a computer program, I have verified that P $6$ does not tile an equilateral triangle of side length $6$ . However, it does tile an equilateral triangle of side length $12$ : A search for side length $18$ did not reveal any solutions after running for a while, but it was nowhere near completion when I halted the search - the tools I'm using don't seem very tractable for this or higher cases. Which equilateral triangles can be tiled by the sphinx polyiamond? Edit: I think that computing the tile homotopy group of the sphinx, as described in this paper , may be promising; as Theorem $7.16$ in the paper shows, it can be used to answer questions of this type for very similar kinds of tiles. Tile homology techniques may work as well, although not if it turns out that there is a signed tiling of the size- $6$ equilateral triangle with the sphinx.","['geometry', 'tiling']"
3953152,How to write any member of a sigma algebra as a subset of a countable union of members of the generating algebra,"I’m currently working my way through Real Analysis by Folland and, in his proof of theorem 1.14 he does something I don’t quite understand: Take some algebra $\mathcal{A}$ on some set $X$ which generates some $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal{M}$ . If we have $E \in \mathcal{M}$ then we write $E \subset A$ , where $A := \cup_{1}^{\infty} A_j$ for some $A_j \in \mathcal{A}$ . Now, I believe this is possible because $X \in \mathcal{A}$ and $E \subset X$ . However, what I don’t understand is that he then goes on to say that, given some $\epsilon > 0$ we can choose the $A_j$ ’s in such a way that $\mu(A) \leq \mu(E) + \epsilon$ for a measure $\mu$ on $(X, \mathcal{M})$ . How can we make such a choice?","['measure-theory', 'outer-measure', 'real-analysis']"
