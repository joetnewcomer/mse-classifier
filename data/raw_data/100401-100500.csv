1392351,First variation of an action?,"I'm working on a problem and I must compute the first variation of an action. Let $\Omega$ is a 2-form on a semi-Riemannian manifold $M$ and $f$ is a smooth function and $\Gamma$ is an 1-form on $M$. I obtained the following equality
\begin{equation}
\int_M (\langle\Gamma-\Omega(\nabla h,.),\delta\rangle+f(x)h )dV_g=0

1392381,"If $d(f(x), f(y)) \leq kd(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in X$. Then $f$ is continuous and has exactly one fixed point","Let $d$ be a complete metric for $X$. Let $f: X \to X$ be a function. Suppose there is a number $k$, with $0 < k < 1$, such that $d(f(x), f(y)) \leq kd(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in X$. Then $f$ is continuous and has exactly one fixed point. To show that $f$ is continuous, it felt like a good idea to use sequential continuity. So we take a convergent sequence $x_n$ with limit $x$. Since $X$ iss complete, we know that $x_n$ is a Cauchy sequence. So for every $\varepsilon/k > 0$ we have some $N \in \mathbb N$ such that for every $n, m \geq N$ we have $d(x_n, x_m) < \varepsilon/k$. But, if $d(x_n, x_m) < \varepsilon/k$, then $d(f(x_n), f(x_m)) < \varepsilon$. So $f(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence which converges to $f(x)$. Hence $f$ is continuous. My problem is how to show that $f$ has exactly one fixed point. What I want to do is assume that $f$ has no fixed points, and then assume that $f$ has at least two, and obtain contradictions. However, I'm not sure how to proceed after assuming $f$ has no fixed points.","['metric-spaces', 'fixed-point-theorems', 'general-topology']"
1392387,Solve trigonometric inequality $ \sin x \sin 2x - \cos x \cos 2x > \sin 6x $,"Solve this trigonometric inequality:
$$ \sin x \sin 2x - \cos x \cos 2x > \sin 6x $$

I tried to say $(\gamma^*d)(f(t))=d(\gamma(f(t))$, but I don't think this is right.

1392461,Homogeneous Isotropic Riemannian Manifolds,"In John Lee's book Riemannian Manifolds on page 33, Lee writes
""Clearly a homogeneous Riemannian manifold that is isotropic at one point is isotropic at every point"". It seems that he means that he concluded this from the following argument: 
Suppose a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is isotropic at $p \in M$ and homogeneous, and take $q \in M$, $v, w \in T_q M$ with $g_q(v, v) = g_q(w, w) = 1$.  Because $M$ is homogeneous, there is a Lie group $G$ that acts smoothly and transitively on $M$ by isometries, so we can find $x \in G$ such that $x \cdot q = p$, hence $x_* v, x_*w \in T_qM$.  Because $M$ is isotropic at $p$, there exists another Lie Group $H$ acting on $M$ smoothly by isometries such that the isotropy subgroup $H_p \subseteq H$ acts transitively on $T_pM$, so there exists $y \in H$ such that $y_*(x_* v) = x_* w$.  We would then have $(x^{-1}yx)_*v = w$ as desired.  However, Lee does not specify in the definitions of homogeneity and isotropy that $G, H$ have to be the same Lie group, so I am not sure why there is a Lie group acting smoothly by isometries on $M$ that contains all elements of the form $x^{-1}yx$, where $x \in G$, $y \in H$. I do not want to use the fact that the isometry group of any Riemannian manifold can be made into a Lie group, since this fact is beyond the scope of this chapter, and is supposedly pretty difficult to prove.  One solution I was thinking of was maybe using a coproduct (free product) of the Lie groups $G, H$, but I was not sure how to give this a topology or smooth structure.  Is there a better way of finishing the above argument?","['lie-groups', 'riemannian-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-actions', 'differential-geometry']"

1392471,Rigorous treatment of expressions with differentials in physics books,"The question is rather general, but let me give a specific example. In thermal physics we have the following identity involving differentials:
$$T\,dS = dE + p\,dV$$
where $T$ = temperature, $S$ = entropy, $E$ = internal energy, $p$ = pressure, $V$ = volume of a system. In many physics books on thermal physics one can find transformations like this:
$$T\,dS = dE + p\,dV \iff dE = T\,dS - p\,dV$$ It's not clear for me why we can do such transformations. For me
$$T\,dS = dE + p\,dV \iff dS = \frac{1}{T}\,dE + \frac{p}{T}\,dV$$
means that for each point $(E, V)$ $dS(E, V)$ is a linear functional with the matrix representation
$$\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{T(E, V)} & \frac{p(E, V)}{T(E, V)}\end{bmatrix}$$
which maps a two-dimensional vector $\begin{bmatrix}\Delta E \\ \Delta V\end{bmatrix}$ to a scalar value $\Delta S$. $dE, dV$ in this interpretation are just syntactic elements, so it's unclear how physicists do their tricks. The question is: how can I rigorously interpret physics books tricks like

It is known that the category of normal projective curves and dominant morphisms between them is equivalent to the opposite category of fields of transcendence degree $1$ over $\mathbb{C}$ and algebraic extensions, so that birational invariants of curves are actually invariants of the function fields, etc. In algebraic geometry, we have nice interpretations of what it means for an extension of function fields to be separable or purely inseparable (even if these ideas are difficult to visualize since they only occur in prime characteristic). Is there a similar geometric way to view Galois extensions? (Or, I suppose, normal extensions?).

(1 answer) Closed 8 years ago . I am having a bit of difficulty showing that the set $A=\{a+b\sqrt{-7},a,b\in\mathbb{Z}/2\}$ (i.e. using integers+half integers) is a euclidean domain.  I see how a lot of the proofs work, like for $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-2}]$.  However, I am a bit confused, as it seems that the trick that happens doesn't work for me.  In those proofs, you show that some remainder $r$ and elements $z,w$ such that $z=qw+r$.  With this, you can show that $N(r)\leq\frac{3}{4}N(z)$.  I am not getting this $\frac{3}{4}$, I am getting $\frac{8}{4}$, or just some constant that isn't less than 1.  Furthermore, I've looked at some of the other posts when your $d=1$mod$4$, but it looks like they're using the same norm, so I don't know. Here's my work:
Let the norm of an element in $A$ be $N(a+b\sqrt{-7})=4(a^2+7b^2).$ Now I am not entirely sure about multiplying this by 4, but it seems that the norm function has to map into $\mathbb{N}\cup{0}$, so in order to guarantee that this happens I need the 4 to account for the half integers being squared (does it matter that $\mathbb{N}$ has a bijection with $\frac{\mathbb{N}}{4}$? Let $z,w\in A$.  Then there are real numbers $c,d$ such that $\frac{w}{z}=c+d\sqrt{-7}$.  Let $q_1,q_2\in\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{2}$ be the closest elements to $c,d$ respectively.  Then we have $|q_1-c|\leq\frac{1}{4}$ and $|q_2-d|\leq\frac{1}{4}$.  Setting $q=q_1+q_2\sqrt{-7}$ and $r=\frac{w}{z}-q$, so $w=qz+rz$.  Now it remains to show that $N(rz)=N(r)N(z)\leq N(z)$, and this is where my problem is.  For $N(r)$, my first question is why in the world can I even apply the norm to $r$ since it must not even belong to my set $A$.  Ignoring that technicality, we have that $r=(q_1-c)+(q_2-d)\sqrt{-7}$, so $N(r)=4[|q_1-c|^2+7|q_2-d|]\leq 4[(1/4)^2+7(1/4)^2=2.$  If my 4 from the norm wasn't part of my norm function, then I would be good to go, but I've explained why I'm not sure that works.

$$\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\sin^2(x^p)}{x^q+x^r}=\begin{cases} 0 & \text{if either $q < 2p$ or $r < 2p$} \\ \frac 12 & \text{if $q=r=2p$} \\ 1 & \text{if either $q=2p$, $r > 2p$ or $q > 2p$, $r=2p$} \\ \infty & \text{if $q > 2p$, $r > 2p$} \end{cases}$$ Also, in the case of $p=3$, $q=6$, $r=7$, the expression becomes $$\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\sin^2(x^3)}{x^6+x^7}.$$

Regardless, here is my idea: We must have 
$$f(X_1)=Y-Y_2$$
$$g(Y_2)=X-X_1$$
Now by solving this like a linear system we find
$$f(X_1)=Y-g^{-1}(X-X_1)=g^{-1}(X_1)$$
Which suggests to me the following construction: construct a set $X_1$ as follows:
$$X_1^0=X-g(Y)$$
$$X_1^{n+1}=X_1^n\bigcup g(f(X_1^n))$$ Now I'm don't know anything about transfinite recursion, which I believe is what we need to utilise here in order to conclude that this proces does in fact specify a set $X_1$. Now we set $X_2=X-X_1$, $Y_1=f(X_1)$, $Y_2=Y-Y_1$. Now we only need to show that $f(X_1)=Y_1$ and $g(Y_2)=X_2$. The first one is true by definition and for the second one: $x\in g(Y_2)$. Suppose $x\not\in X_2$, so $x\in X_1$. Then either $x\in X_1^0$, which is not possible since $x\in g(Y)$. Or $x\in X_1^n$ for $n>N$. However, then we can write $x=g(f(x'))$ for some $x'\in X_1^N\subset X_1$, so $x\in g(f(X_1))=g(Y_1)$, which is a contradiction, since $g$ is injective and $Y_2=Y-Y_1$. $x\in X_2$. Suppose $g^{-1}(x)\not\in Y_2$, so $g^{-1}(x)\in Y_1=f(X_1)$. So then $x=g(f(x'))$ for some $x'\in X_1$. But then also $x\in X_1$ by construction of $X_1$, which is a contradiction. I think this is kind of correct, but not completely. My main problem with it is that I'm not sure if $X_1$ is well defined. I'm also a bit confused by the fact that this seems to just be a set-theory question, not at all a topology question. Is this true? I know that if $f:X\to f(X)\subset Y$ is a homeomorphism, then $f|A:A\to f(A)\subset Y$ is also a homeomorphism, so the fact that $f,g$ are homeomorphisms doesn't seem that relevant...

When can we find some metric $d$ which induces the original topology on $X$ making $f$ an isometry? Partial Results: $\text{(1)}$ If $f$ is of finite order the answer is yes. (Take any metric and sum on translates of it by $f$). $\text{(2)}$ We found some obstructions (based on suggestion by PVAL, communicated by Mike:) Roughly, a necessary condition for $f$ to be a potential isometry, is that it won't be contractive or expansive (for any realizing metric) on subspaces of $X$. The main idea is that if $f$ is behaving very badly w.r.t one realizing metric, then it will behave badly for any other realizing metric. An accurate formulation is found below. (see also my detailed answer). This rules our for example $f(x)=x^3,f(x)=2x,f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x $ on $X=\mathbb{R}$ . While the above obstructions seems quite useful in eliminating candidates,
I would still like to find more necessary\sufficient conditions for this property to hold. (In particular, I feel that the although the obstructions found are ingenious, there is something cumbersome in their formulation, since verifying them would require us to go over all possible metrics for $X$). Proposition (precise statement of the obstructions found): The following two conditions imply $f$ cannot be an isometry of any realizing metric for the topology of $X$. $\text{(1)}$ There exists a realizing metric $d$ on $X$ such that  $f$ restricts to a contracting (or expanding) map on a (non-trivial) compact subspace of $X$. $\text{(2)}$ There exists a realizing metric $d$ on $X$ such that  $f$ restricts to a contracting (or expanding) map on a subspace of finite diameter of $X$ which contains a fixed point of $f$ .

Mathematica v10 returns the integral unevaluated, both with Integrate[] and InverseFourierTransform[]. The question comes from a research problem in quantum physics. Edit-3: (makes Edit-1 obsolete).
The function is real-valued and positive, see continuous line on the numerically produced graph. Dashed lines are  $\sqrt{2} \, e^{-\pi x}/\sqrt{x}$ for $x \to +\infty$ and $20 \,  e^{+\pi x} \sqrt{-x}$ for $x \to -\infty$, confirming the asymptotics derived by @tired. Edit-2: Here is what is relevant for the publication on the physics side. We are are proposing a method to generate quantum particles described by the wave-function $\psi(x)$. The unprecedented feature of the method (in the particular physics context) is that the Heisenberg product of coordinate-momentum uncertainty $\Delta x \, \Delta p \approx 0.537541$ is close to the so-called Kennard bound of $1/2$ (known to be satisfied by Gaussian wave-packet only). For the momentum the result is neat:
$$(\Delta p)^2 = \int \frac{p^2}{4 \cosh^2(p/2)} dp= \frac{\pi^2}{3}$$ For the coordinate I need to compute $\Delta x \equiv \langle x^2 \rangle-\langle x \rangle^2$ where $$ \langle x^n \rangle =\frac{1}{2\pi} \int x^n \,  |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx$$ Numerically I have $ \langle x \rangle \approx  -0.251022$ and $\langle x^2 \rangle \approx  0.150842$ which gives the above quoted uncertainty product. So it would be very nice to find an analytic form for the first two moments of the probability distribution corresponding to $| \psi(x)|^2$ and also to prove analytically the exponential asymptotics (which distinguishes these wave-packets from other types known in the literature in my field of physics).","['gamma-function', 'fourier-analysis', 'integration', 'asymptotics', 'complex-analysis']"

1393425,"Equivalent, finite measures if and only if strictly positive Radon-Nikodym derivative exists","Problem statement: Let $(X,\mathcal{A})$ be a measurable space, and let $\mu$ and $\nu$ be two finite measures. We say $\mu$ and $\nu$ are equivalent measures if $\mu \ll \nu$ and $\nu \ll \mu$ (if $\nu$ and $\mu$ are each absolutely continuous w.r.t. the other). Show that $\mu$ and $\nu$ are equivalent if and only if there exists a $\mu$-integrable function $f$ is that is strictly positive a.e.  w.r.t. $\mu$ such that $d \nu = f d\mu$. My attempt at a solution: For the reverse direction, I tried to use the Radon-Nikodym theorem. Since $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, and $\nu$ is finite, and $\nu \ll \mu$, there exists a $\mu$-integrable, non-negative function, measurable function, call it $f$, such that $\nu(A) = \int_A f d\mu$ for all $A \in \mathcal{A}$. Now, we just need to show that this function is strictly positive a.e. to get our conclusion. What I tried was to set $B = \{x : f(x) = 0\}$, and noting that 
$$\nu(B) = \int_B f d\mu,$$
we find that $\nu(B) = 0$. But $\mu \ll \nu$, so we have that $\mu(B) = 0$, as well, and we are done. For the forward direction, we assume that there exists a $\mu$-integrable, strictly positive a.e. function w.r.t. $\mu$ such that $d\nu = f d\mu$. Now, this implies that for any measurable set $A$, 
$$ \nu(A) = \int_Af d\mu.$$
It is clear that $\nu(A) \ll \mu(A)$. Now if $\nu(A) = 0$, we have that $0 = \int_A fd\mu$. What I would like to say there is that this implies that $f = 0$ a.e. on $A$, which I believe I can prove, but that since $f$ is strictly positive a.e., that therefore $\mu(A) = 0$. Here is my problem: I don't think that I have used that $\mu$ is a finite measure anywhere, which makes me very uncomfortable. I also am a little unsure regarding the argument for the forward direction.

This is the progress so far. regular elements are closed under multiplication, their multiplications are cancellative. Therefore we can conceive the set $M$ of regular elements, if it had order $5$ then it would be a finite cancellative semigroup, hence a group. Since $5$ is prime it would have to be a cyclic group. Therefore $M$, with multiplication, would be isomorphic to $\mathbb Z_5$.

What I got was $$\frac25n^{2.5}+\frac12n^{1.5}+\frac{15}8n^{0.5}+\dots,$$ nothing particularly resemblant to the left-hand side. After that I went to googling for something about sums of powers of natural numbers, found Faulhaber's formula $$\sum_{k=1}^n k^p = \frac{1}{p+1}\sum_{j=0}^p (-1)^j \genfrac{(}{)}{0}{}{p+1}{j}B_j n^{p+1-j},$$ and after (mis)using it with $p=1.5$ I obtained $$\frac25n^{2.5}+\frac12n^{1.5}.$$ While this last result is a more accurate approximation for $\sum_{k=1}^n k^{1.5}$, and is a partial sum for the expansion of the original right-hand side, I still can't understand how the original approximation was obtained. Can someone suggest its source, how one could have conceived of it?","['power-series', 'combinatorics']"

1393836,What is the necessary and sufficient condition when an $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z} $ is invertible over $ \mathbb{Z}$,"I read a proposition on the textbook. It says that an $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{Z}$  is invertible over $\mathbb{Z}$ if and only if it can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices all of which are over $\mathbb{Z}$. The book left the proof to readers. But I do not think that the proposition holds. For example when matrix $A = \left( \begin{array}{cc}2 & 0\\
0 & 1 \end{array}\right)$. It is elementary over $\mathbb{Z}$. But $inv(A) = \left( \begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{2} & 0\\
0 & 1 \end{array} \right)$ which is not over $\mathbb{Z}$. Guys where did I make the mistake?","['linear-algebra', 'matrices']"

1393879,Detail regarding tangent spaces and dual varieties from Harris's Algebraic Geometry: A First Course,"In Harris's Algebraic Geometry: A First Course, Example 16.20, the author shows that the dual of the dual variety $X^{*}$ is the original variety $X$. I think in chapter 15, Harris mentions that he'll be working in characteristic 0 in the subsequent chapters. I might have missed more, but, if we assume $X_{sm}\subset X$ and $X_{sm}^{*}\subset X$ are dense, the only place I can see where he used characteristic zero is where he let $\Phi$ be the closure of $\tilde{\Phi}:=\{(p,H):p\in X_{sm}, H\supset T_pX\}$ in $X\times X^{*}$, and claimed using Proposition 14.4 that the projections $\pi_1: \Phi\rightarrow X$ and $\pi_2: \Phi\rightarrow X^{*}$ are surjective on tangent spaces generically. 1) Is it true that the maps $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are surjective on tangent spaces generically in general characteristic? Since the maps are projecting away variables, maybe the pathologies related to characteristic $p$ wouldn't happen. 2) In general characteristic, if $X_{sm}$ is a dense open set in $X$, is $(X^{*})^{*}=X$? Can something weird like $X_{sm}\subset X$ is dense, but $X_{sm}^{*}\subset X^{*}$ is empty happen? 3) Finally, is there a good reference for the proof that $(X^{*})^{*}=X$ if I'm just interested in plane curves (but a completely algebraic proof, not one where you parametrize the curve over $\mathbb{C}$)?","['algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request', 'algebraic-curves']"

$f$ is Lebesgue integrable if and only if $|f|$ is Lebesgue integrable. 
First, suppose $f$ is Lebesgue integrable, by definition, $f$ is measurable and nonnegative, so $f=|f|$ and $\displaystyle \int_E f \, d \mu=\int_E|f| \, d\mu$ implies that $|f|$ is Lebesgue integrable. Second, suppose $|f|$ is Lebesgue integrable, if $f$ is nonnegative, then $f=|f|$, so $f$ is Lebesgue integrable; if $f$ is negative, then how can I prove?","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

  (There is only one up to diffeomorphism; that is not the question

$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)=\int_0^1 f(x)dx$$
I was wondering under which conditions on $f$ this could be extended to the case of the positive real line, i.e which conditions on $f$ would enable us to be able to rigorously write:
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\geq0} f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)=\int_0^{\infty} f(x)dx$$

Then I wish to prove the result. If  $W=\{h^i_j\}$ is the Weingarten map and $P(W)$ is an invariant polynomial of degree $\alpha$, i.e. $P(\rho W)=\rho^{\alpha}P(W)$, then 1) $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}h^i_j=\Delta h_j^i+|A|^2h_j^i$ 2)$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}P=\Delta P- \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial h_{ij}\partial h_{pq}}\nabla_lh_{ij}\nabla_lh_{pq}+\alpha|A|^2P$ I'm able to prove the first part as follows, $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}h^i_j=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(g^{ik}h_{jk})
=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(g^{ik})h_{jk}+\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(h_{jk})g^{ik}$ $=2Hg^{is}h_{sl}g^{lk}h_{jk}+(\nabla h_{jk}-2Hh_{jl}h^l_k+|A|^2h_{jk})g^{ik}$ $=\Delta h_j^i+|A|^2H_j^i$. To work out $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}g^{ij}$ you just need to use the fact that $g^{ij}g_{ij}=1$ I think I'm missing a simple useful result to get part 2) out?","['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'mean-curvature-flows']"
