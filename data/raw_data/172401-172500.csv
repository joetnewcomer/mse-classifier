3062109,"Is $ f(A) = A + 2A^{T} $ an isomorphism of $ \mathbb R^{5,5} $ onto itself?","I have problem with prove or disprove this hypothesis: Is the linear transformation $ f \in L(\mathbb R^{5,5},\mathbb R^{5,5}) $ $$ f(A) = A + 2A^{T} $$ an isomorphism of the space $ \mathbb R^{5,5} $ onto itself? In order to be an isomorphism, $f$ must be injective and surjective. Checking if it is surjective: Assume that as a result we want to get: $$\mathbf{Q} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
 q_{11} & q_{12} & \cdots & q_{1n} \\
 q_{21} & q_{22} & \cdots & q_{2n} \\
 \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
 q_{m1} & q_{m2} & \cdots & q_{mn}
 \end{bmatrix} $$ and we put as argument $$  \mathbf{A} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
 a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
 a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
 \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
 a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
 \end{bmatrix} $$ then choose $i,j$ . Factors $a_{ij}$ $a_{ji}$ $q_{ij}$ $q_{ji}$ are only in this linear system: $$q_{ij} = a_{ij} + 2a_{ji}  \wedge  q_{ji} = a_{ji} + 2a_{ij}$$ so $$ a_{ij} = \frac{2q_{ij}-q_{ji}}{3} $$ and $$ a_{ji} = \frac{2q_{ji}-q_{ij}}{3} $$ so the factors $ a_{ij}$ $ a_{ji}$ are determined unambiguously. So it is surjective. But how to deal with checking injectivity? Suppose that $$ A+2A^T=B+2B^T $$ $$ A-B = 2(A^T-B^T) $$ and I don't know how to finish that.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'vector-space-isomorphism']"

I also understand that we can take its total derivative which is with respect to all of its arguments, which can be expressed as $\frac{dt}{dw}f(x,y,z)$ . My question: how do we represent the derivative with respect to some but not all of a multivariable function's variables? How is this derivative classified?

3062274,Is there a natural group of subgroups of a group?,"Take a group $G$ , and consider the set of all its subgroups. Is there a natural way to define multiplication of subgroups, in such a manner that the set forms a group? If so, how is the operation constricted, and what is this group called? The reason I came up with the question and why it might seem natural is this. A consequence of the isomorphism theorems is that $HH'/H\cong H'$ whenever $H,H'$ are disjoint subgroups and $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ , and furthermore, if $H,H'$ both happen to be normal subgroups in $G$ with $H\leq H'\leq G$ , then $(G/H)/(H'/H)\cong G/H'$ . So in some twisted sense, it seems like for at least a certain situations and for certain types of subgroups of $G$ , there may be a natural method of defining multiplication that allows us to actually ""do arithmetic"" over the subgroups of $G$ ? This is in the sense that, over this proposed group, we can actually just ""cancel $H$ "" in $(G/H)/(H'/H)\cong G/H'$ as a consequence of how multiplication is defined. It seems very interesting (to me, at least) what the consequences of defining such a group might be. Sorry if the question is vague, but here's an idea of what I'm not looking for: Take any group, consider all its $n$ subgroups, and define multiplication in some arbitrary way, such as the multiplication over $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ . If we do this, we completely lose the fact that these elements started out as subgroups of a group, and the interesting algebraic structure is lost! Instead, I'm interested in whether there is such a way of defining this group of subgroups that preserves the algebraic properties of the original group $G$ . A naÃ¯ve construction I tried that doesn't work: for two subgroups $H,H'$ of an abelian group $G$ , define $HH'=\{hh':h\in H,h'\in H'\}$ . It's quite easy to verify this always gives a subgroup of $G$ , so we have closure, and associativity and such are easily checked too. The problem is that most subgroups of $G$ have no inverse in this ""group"" of subgroups for a general group $G$ , because for $HH'=1$ , we require $hh'=1$ for every $h\in H$ , $h'\in H'$ which is not possible in all but the most trivial cases. As noted in the comments, if we removed the hypothesis that $G$ is abelian, then its subgroups need not be normal, and this construction fails even more badly since we don't even have closure anymore. So in general, this construction would not go anywhere close to working. Any thoughts, or links to something that has already been done, are greatly appreciated!","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
3062293,Can a function be smooth at a single point?,"I saw a thread ( Find a function smooth at one isolated point ) in which it is asked whether or not it is possible for a function to be smooth at a point, but not smooth on a deleted neighbourhood  of said point.

I want to generalize this game by using the minimum number of $n$ images, having $m$ cards, each with $r$ images and $t$ common images. However, I am having trouble with finding $m$ given $n,r$ and $t$ . In the case of $t=1$ I start to build the cards like this: $$A_1 = \{1,2,\ldots,r\}.$$ A new card must have one common element with the first card: $$A_2 = \{c_{1,2}, r+1,\ldots, 2r-1 \},$$ where $c_{1,2}\in A_1$ . A new card must have one common element with the second and first cards: $$A_3 = \{c_{1,3},c_{2,3}, 2r,2r+1,\ldots, 3r-3\},$$ where $c_{1,3}\in A_1$ and $c_{2,3}\in A_2\setminus A_1$ .

Since the space of entire functions is a Frechet space, and hence a nuclear space, I am hoping that the analgoue of Lemma 3.1 holds.

3062433,Selecting a menu,"While perusing old unanswered puzzle questions, I came across this one . I found it quite interesting, but a bit vague, so I've decided to recast it. A party is to be held at a restaurant. The restaurant has the ability to make $D$ different dishes, but the menu for the party will be a fixed menu featuring just $d$ dishes, where $d < D$ . To select which dishes should be on the menu, the $n$ guests are asked to rank all D dishes. For which values of $D$ , $d$ and $n$ is it always possible to select $d$ dishes such that for any dish $k$ not on the menu, more than half the guests would prefer one of the dishes in the menu over dish $k$ ? Let's look at a concrete example. Suppose the number of possible dishes was $D=10$ , the number of selected dishes was $d=3$ and the number of guests was $n=10$ . The worst possible ranking I can think of (though I'm not sure it is the worst) is shown below: The ranks are spread out so no guest ranks any dish the same. I now selected the $3$ dishes marked in green so that the ranks of $1,2, 3$ were distributed among the guests as much as possible. Thus, only guest $10$ does not have one of the selected dishes in his top $3$ . If you now go through each of the unselected dishes, you will see that in every case a majority of the guests will have a higher ranked dish among the $3$ selected dishes. So (assuming my worst case actually is the worst case!) with these values of $D$ , $d$ and $n$ , it is always possible to select such a menu. Any input as to whether a worse case ranking is possible, would also be appreciated. EDIT - Partial results After fiddling with this question, I realize I should probably have asked ""Given $n$ and $D$ , what is the minimum required $d$ to fulfill the constraint?"". Afterall, if a certain value of $d$ works, then so will any larger value of $d$ . My biggest problem, oddly, is how to know the worst possible ranking. To test conjectures, I need to test them against the worst case. But I'm not completely sure what that is, for a given $n$ and $D$ . Anyway, an initial result is that a menu is always possible if $d > \frac{n}{2}$ . A second tentative result is that if $n = D$ then $d = 2$ . E.g., if I select dish $1$ and $6$ in my example above, the constraint is fulfilled. But this implies that if a $1000$ people ranked a $1000$ dishes, it would still be possible to select $2$ dishes that fulfilled the constraint. This doesn't seem right. But if I use the ""worst case"" scenario which I used in my example above, this is the result I get. I'd appreciate if someone could post a counter-example. I suspect the problem is that my ""worst case"" is not the actual worst case. EDIT2 - Outragous! Further fiddling and computer simulation suggests the outragous claim that if $n \ge D$ then still $d = 2$ . This implies that if a $1,000$ dishes were ranked by a $1,000,000$ guests, we could always find just $2$ dishes which fulfilled the constraint! I must be doing something wrong. As usual, counter-examples would be greatly appreciated. EDIT3 So I've now done $10,000$ simulations with $30$ dishes and $60$ guests, where the guests ranked the dishes randomly, and in every case a menu of just $2$ dishes was sufficient. My confidence that $2$ dishes will always be sufficient for $n \ge D$ grows. :-) But a proof or counter-example would be nice.

3062462,Catalan numbers: bijection between applications of a binary operator and Dyck words.,"The Wikipedia article on Catalan numbers lists various combinatorial objects that are described by them. I posit that there might be bijections between these various combinatorial objects. For some of them (like Dyck paths, correctly matched parentheses and paths from the bottom left to top right of a $2n \times 2n$ grid) they are quite obvious. I was then trying to find a bijection between the number of Dyck words and the number of ways of associating $n$ applications of a binary operator to $n+1$ items (third one on the list). I attempted to do this for a simple case ( $n=3$ which is the example provided in the Wikipedia article). However, couldn't find one after multiple hours. Is it reasonable to expect such a bijection will exist? If so, how do we go about finding it? EDIT: In addition to the very nice answer by @Marc, the following page also helped me see the bijection: http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/Clase/EC/Homework/3.3.Jorge.pdf ""Let $P$ be the Dyck path and $f(P)$ be the binary tree. If you go up in the Dyck path, create a left child. Otherwise, go up one vertex until creating a new right child is possible and create one."" Here is one of my attempts: Number of Dyck words with length $2 \times 3$ is $\frac{6 \choose 3}{4} = 5$ . They are: hhhttt; hhthtt; hhttht; hthhtt; hththt And the number of applications of a binary operator among $3+1=4$ factors is: ((ab)c)d;     (a(bc))d;     (ab)(cd);     a((bc)d);     a(b(cd)) Both combinatorial objects have been arranged in a way that there is some kind of ordering between them. For the Dyck words for example, if h equals +1 and t equals -1, then the order is lexicographical from the left to the right of the cumulative score along the sequence. Now, the first and last characters of the Dyck words are always h and t respectively. So, we can ignore them. We are left with: hhtt; htht; htth; thht; thth I tried to start from the left of the sequence abcd and if I see 'h', merge the character with the one to its right. This approach didn't produce a valid mapping from the third Dyck word to the third binary operator precedence order.","['permutations', 'catalan-numbers', 'combinatorial-proofs', 'combinatorics', 'sequences-and-series']"

3062524,What is the reason for commutative property during multiplication of real numbers,"This may seem like a really stupid question, but I am unable to rationalize with myself as to why the commutative property exists when multiplying 2 real number.

What is the reason for this property, I know I may be over-thinking this, but I can't understand intuitively why this happens.

3062649,gradient flows on Hilbert manifolds,"I would like to know if gradient flows of Morse-Bott functions on a Riemannian manifold always converge towards a unique critical point, provided that the flow line is bounded. To be more precise, a Morse-Bott function on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is a smooth map $f:M \longrightarrow \mathbb R$ such that the set of critical points $Crit f \subset M$ is a submanifold and $T_x Crit f = ker Hess f_x$ for all $x \in Crit f$ . It might be more convenient to express this by using the linear map $A_x:T_xM \longrightarrow T_xM$ given by $g_x(A_xv,w) = 
Hess f_x(v,w)$ for $v,w \in T_xM$ . I am interested in the behaviour of maps $x:\mathbb R_+ \longrightarrow M$ satisfying $\dot x(t) = -\nabla f(x(t))$ . Does $lim_{t \to \infty} x(t)$ exist? An easy computation shows that $df_{x(s)} \longrightarrow 0$ for $s \to \infty$ . So if $x$ is bounded (e.g. if $M$ is compact) $x$ has to ""converge"" towards $Crit f$ . UNfortunately, this does not rule out that $x$ has several limits in $Crit f$ . (This can not happen for Morse functions, since in this case the critical points are isolated). The simplest case is the case where $M$ is finite dimensional. As far as I can see, the answer is already given by Austin and Braam in their paper ""Morse-Bott theory and equivariant cohomology"", 1995. In particular Theorem A.9 is important, stating that the stable manifold of a connected component $C \subset Crit f$ , given by $W^s(C) = \{x \in M | \phi_t(x) \to C\}$ where $\phi$ is the flow of the negative gradient, is indeed a submanifold. The second case is the case where $M$ is a Hilbert manifold (infinite dimensional) endowed with a complete metric on the tangent bundle. Although I could only find a paper dealing with this question in the Morse case (see Abbondandolo, Majer: ""A Morse complex for infinite dimensional manifolds"", Appendix C), I assume that it should be not to hard to extend the result to the Morse-Bott case. The important point here is that the operator $A_x$ mentioned above is symmetric and defined on the whole tangent space, so it has to be bounded. The last case is the one I am particularly interested in. We start again with a Hilbert manifold $M$ , but now endowed with an incomplete Riemannian metric (in my case, I have a Sobolev space $W^{1,2}$ which is only endowed with the $L^2$ metric). Let $H$ denote the complete Hilbert space where $T_xM \subset H$ is dense. Then the operator $A$ is unfortunately of the form $A_x:T_xM \subset H \longrightarrow H$ . Now $A_x$ is unbounded, but at least still symmetric and even essentially self-adjoint. However, here I am failing to apply the results from case 2, which strongly used the boundedness of $A$ . I would be very content if a similar result could be shown at least for the case, where $Crit f$ is finite dimensional. A remark: In the infinite dimensional case, one might have problems with the flow, since it might not be defined for all times. However, I start with a flow line which is already defined for all $t$ . Furthermore, I have found (with completely different techniques) a sequence $t_k \to \infty$ such that $x(t_k) \to p \in Crit f$ , which is enough to ensure that $x(t) \to Crit f$ . I would also be thankful for counterexamples where the gradient flow does not have a unique limit. But I expect those examples not to contain Morse-Bott functions.","['gradient-flows', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'morse-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'differential-geometry']"

Some observations follow. Let $F_k$ be the nested radical up to $x^k$ . For large nests, say after $k=10$ , the function monotonically increases from zero onwards. It is hopeless to simply rearrange $F_\infty$ since the powers increase each time - we can no longer write $F_\infty$ as a function of itself to be solved. Here is a plot of $F_{15}$ . What is striking is that the largest value of $x$ in the domain of $F_k$ decreases as $k$ increases. Based on the plot, I think that the domain of $F_\infty$ is $[0,1]$ .

For a) (correction : see edit 1 below), I use as parametrization $(\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta),\cos(\theta))$ . The gradient is $(-\sin(\theta),\cos(\theta),-\sin(\theta))$ . The dot product of that with our vector field in polar coordinates $(-\sin(\theta),2\cos(\theta),-\sin(\theta)+\sin^3(\theta)+\cos(\theta))$ is simply $2-\sin^4(\theta)-\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)$ . If we integrate that from $0$ to $2\pi$ , we get $\frac{13\pi}{4}$ noting that $\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)$ vanishes. For b), the curl of our vector field is $(3y^2-2,0,2)$ . Our parametrization is $(r\cos(\theta),r\sin(\theta),r\cos(\theta))$ . The cross product of the partial derivatives is simply $(-r,0,r)$ . The dot product of that with our curl in polar coordinates is $4r-3r^3\sin^2(\theta)$ . So now, we have $$\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{1}(4r-3r^3\sin^2(\theta))rdrd\theta=\pi\int_{0}^{1}(8r^2-3r^4)rdr=\frac{31\pi}{15}$$ So I don't see where I did something wrong, or where I forgot something. Thanks for your help ! Edit 1: Okay, as was pointed out in the comments and in one answer, I used a wrong parametrization in a). I should use $\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}$ instead of $\cos(\theta)$ for the parametrization of $x$ and $z$ . In this case, we get the dot product of $(-\sin(\theta), \sqrt{2}\cos(\theta), -\sin(\theta)+\sin^3(\theta)+\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}})$ and $(\frac{-\sin(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}, \cos(\theta),\frac{-\sin(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}) $ which yields $$\frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}+\sqrt{2}\cos^2(\theta)+\frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\sin^4(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{2}$$ . If we integrate that from $0$ to $2\pi$ , the last term vanishes and using the common trig identity, we simply integrate $\sqrt{2}-\frac{\sin^4(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}$ . So we get $\frac{13\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}$ . But it's still different fom b) though. Edit 2 : As was pointed out in the comments, I also need to use the new parametrization for part b). But even so, I get $\frac{31\pi}{15\sqrt{2}}$ The cross product of the derivatives is $(\frac{-r}{\sqrt{2}},0,\frac{r}{\sqrt{2}})$ . We need to integrate from $0$ to $2\pi$ $d\theta$ and from $0$ to $1$ $dr$ the following (the curl remains the same): $(\frac{4r}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{3r^3sin^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}})r=\frac{4r^2}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{3r^4sin^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}}$ which yields $\frac{8\pi r^3}{3\sqrt{2}}-\frac{3\pi r^5}{5\sqrt{2}}$ evaluated from $0$ to $1$ and so we get $\frac{31\pi}{15\sqrt{2}}$ Edit 3 : problem solved. I multiplied by an extra $r$ in b). I should not have $(\frac{4r}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{3r^3sin^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}})r$ but simply $(\frac{4r}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{3r^3sin^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{2}})$ See my answer below.","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'vector-analysis']"

On her turn Alice connects a single pair of unconnected points with a single segment of red color. After that Bob connects $k$ pairs of unconnected points with $k$ segments of blue color. Alice wins if she is able to create a triangle with red sides. If all points are connected and Alice was not able to create a red sided triangle before that, Bob wins. Who has a winning strategy? My thoughts: obviously, the outcome of the game heavily depends on releation between $n$ and $k$ . Suppose that $k=1$ with big enough value for $n$ . Alice will simply draw segment $AB$ , Bob draws his segment at will, Alice then draws $AC$ , Bob blocks triangle $ABC$ by drawing segment BC, Alice draws segment $AD$ and Bob is lost. He cannot block triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$ by drawgin a single segment. On the other side, with $k$ big enough, Bob can easily block creation of all red triangles by drawing a lot of lines. So for $k\le k_1$ , Alice wins. For $k\ge k_2\ge k_1$ , Bob wins. I need some estimate for $k_1$ and $k_2$ (better than mine). Also note that the game always has a winner.

(b) Prove that $G$ contains two copies of $K_{r+1}$ with exactly $r$ common vertices. For part a), I have so far tried to use induction on $n$ .

This is where I am stuck, I cannot seem to find anything close to this required vertex. As $e(G) \geq t_r(n) + 1$ we know $K_{r+1} \leq G$ , so there is a vertex $v$ with $d(v) \geq r$ , which is not enough as $(q-1)r \leq \delta(T_r(v)) \leq qr-1$ .

Having read the comments on my post with the circle, I thought that this was fairly straight forward. I chose "" 1 "". This was wrong. The answer was infinite. This caught me as surprising as I didn't think of the equations for a circle and an ellipse as differing by much beyond a scaling factor for each quadratic term. I know that the general equation for an ellipse is as follows: $$\left(\frac{x-h}a\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y-k}b\right)^2 = 1$$ The only thing I can think of is that because of the added scaling factors, there are now technically two additional unknowns (for a total of 4 different unknowns... h, a, k, and b), and therefore I need 4 points to specify an unique ellipse. However, I thought to myself again, even if the ellipse is not centered at the origin, if all 4 given points happened to coincide with the intersection between the major axis and the ellipse and the minor axis and the ellipse, then certainly that would specify an unique ellipse.

(For now, I'm not worrying about the complication of insisting that $X_1$ be nonzero, though feel free to consider it if it actually helps.) What I have tried, part 1: As the $X_i$ s are IID random variables (with mean $\mu = 4.5$ and variance $\sigma^2 = 8.25$ ), the central limit theorem applies, so we expect $\Pr(S = n)$ to be highest for $n$ around $4.5k$ , and the probability distribution of $S$ to be bell-curve-shaped around that value (and most of the probability will be distributed for $n$ about $O(\sqrt{k})$ from that value). Trying to make this more precise, the central limit theorem gives us $$\sqrt{k}(S/k - 4.5) \xrightarrow{d} N(0,8.25) \quad \text{i.e.} \quad \lim _{k\to \infty}\Pr \left[\sqrt{k}(S_{k}/k- 4.5)\le z\right]= \Phi\left(\frac {z}{\sqrt{8.25}}\right)$$ where $\Phi(x) = \frac12 \left[1+\operatorname{erf} \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt {2}}\right)\right]$ is the CDF of the standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$ (and erf is a special function ) and therefore $$\Pr(S \le x) = \Pr(S/\sqrt{k} - 4.5\sqrt{k} \le x/\sqrt{k} - 4.5\sqrt{k}) \to \Phi\left(\frac{x - 4.5k}{\sqrt{8.25k}}\right)$$ and so, applying a continuity correction , $$\begin{align}\Pr(S = n) &\approx \Pr(n - 0.5 < S \le n + 0.5) \\
&\to \Phi\left(\frac{n + 0.5 - 4.5k}{\sqrt{8.25k}}\right) - \Phi\left(\frac{n - 0.5 - 4.5k}{\sqrt{8.25k}}\right) \\
&= \frac12\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{2n+1-9k}{\sqrt{66k}}\right) - \frac12\operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{2n-1-9k}{\sqrt{66k}}\right) \\
&\overset{?}{\approx} \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{66k}}\exp\left(-\left(\frac{2n-9k}{\sqrt{66k}}\right)^2\right)

Let $S_k = X_{k,1} + X_{k,2} + \dots + X_{k,k}$ be the sum of $k$ random digits.

Given an integer $n$ , what is the probability that some element of this sequence is exactly equal to $n$ ? In other words, for each $k$ there is a probability distribution over $n$ , and we want to know the total probability that falls on a single integer $n$ . (Basically for each $n$ there will be some significant probability for $k$ around $n/4.5$ and the probability will fall off significantly for $k$ further away from this.)

I solved it in the below manner and wonder if it is right. Let $X_i$ be a random variable denoting number of trials required to hit 0.  The discrete values it can take are $(1,2,.. i,0)$ where I club all non positive integers on trials to 0. For $X_1$ , the sample space is ${0,1}$ . Actually, it should be represented by hypergeometric distrbution with the teacher striking down each integer by 1.  As an approximation as the number of trials can be infinite, geometric distribution is used.  Thus the probability of success for $X_1$ is $\frac{1}{10}.\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{20}$ .  The probability of failure is $1-p_{success} = \frac{19}{20}$ . Similary for $X_2$ , the sample space is $(0,1,2)$ and the probability of success for $X_2$ is $\frac{1}{10}.\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{30}$ . and that of the failure is $= \frac{28}{30}$ . And thus for $X_{10}$ , the sample space is $(0,1,2,3,..,10)$ and the probability of success for $X_{10}$ is $\frac{1}{10}.\frac{10}{11} = \frac{10}{110}$ and that of the failure is $= \frac{100}{110}$ . Let us define the $X$ as the total number of trials required for the teacher to strike down all integers to 0.

Question : If $H_1$ , $H_2$ have fixed topologies, can we endow $G$ with a topology such that the sequence above becomes a short exact sequence of topological groups? If yes, is this topology then uniquely determined? Motivation : I want to understand the topology of the Weil group $W_K$ which is a dense subgroup of the absolute Galois group $G_K$ (which has this weird profinite topology I find hard to get). However, we have a short exact sequence of abstract groups $$1 \to I_K \to W_K \to \langle \operatorname{Frob}_k \rangle \to 1$$ where $I_K$ denotes the inertia subgroup of $G_K$ and $\operatorname{Frob}_k : x \mapsto x^{|k|}$ is the Frobenius element of the absolute Galois group $G_k$ of the residue field $k$ of $K$ . If I understand it correctly, this sequence is not a short exact sequence of topological groups if we give $W_K$ the subspace topology of $G_K$ . However, if we give $I_K$ and $\langle \operatorname{Frob}_k \rangle$ the subspace topologies of $G_K$ and $G_k$ respectively, we can give $W_K$ a unique topology such that this sequence becomes a short exact sequence of topological groups.

[...] Most uniform higher-dimensional polytopes are obtained by modifying the regular polytopes, or by taking the Cartesian product of polytopes of lower dimensions. In six, seven and eight dimensions, the exceptional simple Lie groups, $E_6$ , $E_7$ and $E_8$ come into play.[...] I am interested in a quantification of the emphasized sentence above. In what sense are these most uniform polytopes? Does the world of uniform polytopes become ""boring"" in, say, more than $30$ dimensions, because there only remain simple variations on regular polytopes and cartesian products?  Or are there exceptional  polytopes expected in higher dimensions too? I would also be satisfied with something like ""this seems to be unknown"", preferably with some reference.","['polytopes', 'discrete-geometry', 'geometry', 'reference-request']"
3063834,Construct bijections of given sets to show that they have the same cardinality and prove they are correct,"I need to construct bijections of few sets to show that they have the same cardinality and prove their correctness. I have already done $f: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ , which was not very hard, but I am struggling with a bit more complex examples. In the following examples $a \bot b$ means, that $a$ and $b$ are coprime numbers. Ex. 1: $\mathbb{N}$ and $\{\langle n,m\rangle \in \mathbb{N}^+\times\mathbb{N}^+ \:|\: m\bot n\}$ It should be a function of the form $g: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}^+\times \mathbb{N}^+$ , but I do not know how should a function of one number create a pair of coprime numbers. Ex. 2: $\{\langle n,m\rangle \in \mathbb{N}^+\times\mathbb{N}^+ \:|\: m\bot n\}$ and $\mathbb{Q}^+$ There the function should have the form $h:\mathbb{N}^+\times\mathbb{N}^+\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}^+$ and I was thinking about a function which would divide $n$ by $m$ , which in my opinion would be pretty understandable, but I am not sure whether it is a correct idea. I would like to get some tips how should I get a grasp in solving such problems, as well as some hints how to solve and prove these two examples.",['elementary-set-theory']

3063869,How does the vector triple product BAC-CAB Identity come about?,"As in the title, I was studying the proof (from Vector Analysis - Louis Brand) of this identity, however I do not completely understand all of the steps. $$a \times (b \times c) = b(a \cdot c) - c(a \cdot b)$$ I also visited an excellent related post - do the BAC-CAB identity for vector triple product have some interpretation? , but I am still stuck. I reproduce the proof in the book here. I don't really understand, how did the author deduce $\alpha=-\lambda(\textbf{v}\cdot\textbf{w}),\beta=\lambda(\textbf{u}\cdot\textbf{w})$ and the basis steps. Any inputs, suggestions or tips to understand the proof would be incredibly helpful! Proof. The vector $(\textbf{u} \times \textbf{v}) \times \textbf{w}$ is perpendicular to both $\textbf{u}\times\textbf{v}$ and therefore coplanar with $\textbf{u}$ and $\textbf{v}$ . $$(\textbf{u}\times\textbf{v})\times\textbf{w}=\alpha\textbf{u}+\beta\textbf{v}$$ But, since $(\textbf{u}\times\textbf{v})\times\textbf{w}$ is also perpendicular to $\textbf{w}$ , $$(\alpha\textbf{u}+\beta\textbf{v})\cdot\textbf{w}=0$$ All numbers $\alpha,\beta$ that satisfy this equation must be of the form $\alpha=\lambda(\textbf{v}\cdot\textbf{w}),\beta=\lambda(\textbf{u}\cdot\textbf{w})$ , where $\lambda$ is arbitrary. Thus, we have $$\textbf{u}\times(\textbf{v}\times\textbf{w})=\lambda\{(\textbf{u}\cdot\textbf{w})v-(\textbf{v}\cdot\textbf{w})\textbf{u}\}$$ In order to determine $\lambda$ , we use a special basis in which $\hat{i}$ is collinear with $\textbf{u}$ , $\hat{j}$ is co-planar with $\textbf{u, v}$ ; then $$\textbf{u}=u_{1}i,\textbf{v}=v_{1}i+v_{2}j,\textbf{w}=w_{1}i+w_{2}j+w_{3}k$$ On substituting these values, we obtain, after a simple calculation, $\lambda=1$ . We therefore have important expansion formulas, $$(\textbf{u}\times\textbf{v})\times\textbf{w}=(\textbf{u}\cdot\textbf{w})\textbf{v}-(\textbf{v}\cdot\textbf{w})\textbf{u}$$ $$\textbf{w}\times(\textbf{u}\times\textbf{v})=(\textbf{w}\cdot\textbf{v})\textbf{u}-(\textbf{w}\cdot\textbf{u})\textbf{v}$$","['cross-product', 'proof-explanation', 'multivariable-calculus', 'vector-analysis']"

This reduces to the question at the identity,i.e. for which $Q \in  \text{SO}_n$ , $T_Q\text{SO}_n=T_{Id}\text{SO}_n=\text{skew}$ . I will now prove that $Q^2=Id$ is a necessary condition. Is it sufficient? Since $T_Q\text{SO}_n=QT_{Id}\text{SO}_n=Q\text{skew}$ , this happens if and only if $Q\text{skew}=\text{skew}$ , i.e. $-AQ^T=(QA)^T=-QA$ for every $A \in \text{skew}$ , or $AQ^T=QA$ . Taking traces we get $$ \langle Q,A\rangle=\text{tr}(Q^TA)=\text{tr}(AQ^T)=\text{tr}(QA)=\text{tr}(AQ)=-\text{tr}(A^TQ)= \langle A,Q\rangle,$$ so $\langle Q,A\rangle=0$ for every $A \in \text{skew}$ , i.e. $Q \in \text{skew}^{\perp}=\text{sym}$ , so $Q^T=Q$ , or $Q^2=Id$ . Note that at even dimensions $Q=-Id$ is always a solution. For dimension $n=2$ , this is indeed the only non-trivial solution (since $\text{SO}_2$ is the circle). In that case $Q^2=Id$ , and $Q=\pm Id$ are equivalent.","['riemannian-geometry', 'tangent-spaces', 'orthogonal-matrices', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

Here we equip $X$ with the weak topology, and $X^{**}$ with the weak-* topology, i.e. $\sigma(X^{**},X^*)$ . I think that this is true. To start with I have shown that it is at least continuous by using nets. I also wanted to show that the inverse is continuous (but I could not figure this out using nets), but here's how far I got: So assume that the net $f_a \rightarrow f$ weakly (here the $f_a$ lie in $X^{**}$ ). We want to show $\Lambda^{-1}(f_a) \rightarrow \Lambda^{-1}(f)$ weakly. Note that $f_a \rightarrow f$ weakly is equivalent to $f_a(x) \rightarrow f(x)$ for all $x \in X^{*}$ . And that the conclusion is equivalent to $x(\Lambda^{-1}(f_a)) \rightarrow x(\Lambda^{-1}(f))$ weakly for all $x \in X^*$ .

You'll see the example here 1) Why is this a counter-example since $e^{-k|x|}\notin \mathcal S(\mathbb R)$ ? and is even not derivable at $0$ , so $f'(x)$ is not well defined on $\mathbb R$ , is it ? Because on $L^2(\mathbb R)\setminus \mathcal S(\mathbb R)$ , the operator $T$ can be different than $Tf(x)=f'(x)$ ? (for example the fourier transform is not the same on $\mathcal S(\mathbb R)$ than on $L^2(\mathbb R)$ . 2) Just under the example in the previous link, they say that the existence of unbounded operators defined everywhere is non constructive relying on Hahn-Banach theorem .
