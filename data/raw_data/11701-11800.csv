90974,Calculating Distance of a Point from an Ellipse Border,"I'm thinking about using oriented ellipses to represent curves (dents/bumps etc.) in my physics engine, and have a few questions about working with them: What methods are there to finding the minimum distance between a point and an ellipse? I need methods of varying cost (in terms of # of calculations) for different parts of my engine. I'm currently aware of two methods to testing if a point is inside/outside an ellipse. In the first you plug in the point coordinates into the equation (x/a)^2 + (y/b)^2 and seeing if it's >, <, or = to 1 ( does the output -1 give the min. distance to the ellipse border? ) In the second you translate the point to the ellipse's coordinates and horizontally/vertically stretch both the ellipse and point in order to turn the ellipse into a circle. ( I rarely see this method used... any reason I should be aware of?) How do you test the distance between two ellipses? I figure you could combine the two methods above by transforming both ellipses in a way that makes one a circle, then test the distance from the center of the circle ellipse to the regular ellipse's edge, and finally compare that distance to the radius of the circle ellipse.","['geometry', 'conic-sections', 'computer-science']"

I've read looked at the examples in most category theory books and it normally has little Analysis. Which, is strange as I've even seen lattice theory be used to motivate a whole book on category theory. I was wondering is there a nice application of category theory to functional analysis? It's weird as read that higher category theory is used in Quantum mechanics as it foundation, yet QM has heavy use of Hilbert spaces.","['category-theory', 'soft-question', 'analysis']"

I did in the following way, but got stuck here. Since $\mathbb{P}(X_i=x_i)=e^{\lambda^i}\frac{\lambda^{i x_i}}{x_i!}$. Then the likelihood is $\mathcal L(\lambda;X)=\prod_i^n e^{\lambda^i}\frac{\lambda^{i x_i}}{x_i!}$. And the loglikelihood is
$\ell(\lambda;X)=C-\sum_i^n \lambda^i+(\log\lambda)\sum_{i=1}^n ix_i$. By taking derivative w.r.t. $

91002,"Convergence  of $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{p_{k^2}}$, where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime","Two brief questions. This seems true but I don't find it using Google.  (1) Isn't $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{p(k^2)}$$, in which $p(k^2)$ is the $k^2$th prime, known to converge? I expected to find something in Plouffe around 0.747187, but did not. It seems that $p(k^2) > k^2$ proves convergence, but then did I miscalculate the constant? It occurred to me that we might we use comparison (via the PNT) for a series, but all we know is that termwise $$\frac{1}{p(k^2)}\sim \frac{1}{k^2\ln k^2},$$ and
I don't think that  $a\sim b$ and $c \sim d$ gives $a+c \sim b+d$ ? So, (2) is it correct that the logarithmic sum also converges but gives no clue as to convergence of the sum in question?","['analytic-number-theory', 'convergence-divergence', 'number-theory']"
91026,Deriving an asymptotic formula,"I'm doing some exercises in a book on asymptotic analysis.  While I think I found a solution to this problem, I'm not entirely sure if it's correct, and I want to make sure that I know what's going on. The exercise is to show that
$\int_1^x (1+t^{-1})^t dt = ex - \frac{1}{2}e \log{x} + O(1)$, for $x > 1$, with the hint to first show that $e^{-1}(1+t^{-1})^t = 1 -\frac{1}{2}t^{-1} + O(t^{-2})$, $(t > 1)$.  Getting the first statement from the second is simple.  Using the fact that $\log(1+t^{-1}) = t^{-1} - \frac{1/2}t^{-2} + O(t^{-3})$ for $t>1$, we have that $$e^{-1}(1+t^{-1})^t = \exp(t\log(1+t^{-1})-1)=\exp(-\frac{1}{2}t^{-1}+O(t^{-2})))$$ At this point, I have to use what feels like a really handwavey argument and argue that, since $-\frac{1}{2}t^{-1}+O(t^{-2})) = 1 -\frac{1}{2}t^{-1} + O(t^{-2})$, evaluating a decreasing function (which $\exp$ is on the LHS, for the given values of $t$) on the left-hand side will preserve the relation. Thus, my question is whether my derivation is correct, especially the last part.  In addition, I'm curious why the last part is necessary- it feels like throwing away a lot of information (although I might just not yet be used to how much information to throw away in asymptotic proofs), and my only guess as to why is to get something that's easy to integrate.  Is there some other reason?","['asymptotics', 'analysis']"

There are a few theorems we can use here, but I don't seem to be able to put them together quite right. I want to show that the center of $G$ is divisible by the prime number $5$. If this is the case, then we can apply Cauchy's theorem and we are done. By Sylow's theorems we get that there are unique $3$-Sylow, $5$-Sylow, and $13$-Sylow subgroups in $G$. Since they are of prime order, they are abelian. Furthermore, their intersection is trivial (by a theorem I beleive).

91159,Nonnegative linear functionals over $l^\infty$,"My purpose is a clarification of the role of the axiom of choice in constructing limits for bounded sequences. Namely, we want a linear functional of norm 1 defined on the space of all bounded complex sequences that takes nonnegative sequences to nonnegative numbers. We also want that it annihilate all sequences with finite number of nonzero elements, and that it take constant sequences to the same constant. It is well known that such functionals can be realized as limits along free ultrafilters, thus the axiom of choice is needed. I would like to understand if the construction can be simplified if, instead of the ultrafilters, we allow functionals with properties as described above. Here are my questions: Does there exist an explicit construction of such a functional? If not, does this mean that there are formal reasons why the explicit construction cannot exist? Is it possible to establish the fact that the functional exists without using the axiom of choice? Update after discussion: It is important that there are different ""levels"" of the axiom of choice. If I felt this better when I wrote this posting, I would also add the following question answered below in the affirmative: Is it possible to construct the functional as desired without ultrafilters, but with using only the Hahn-Banach theorem for the space $l^\infty$? This question looks more natural and elementary than the list of my questions, but the path sometimes gives you more than the goal.

I've seen the nice unit circle animations that do explain it fairly well. But would it be fair to say that: The period of the curve of the sine or cosine function is how fast one full rotation of the circle happens. So as the period decreases I imagine the circle or ""wheel"" speeding up. The amplitude of the curve of the sine or cosine function is the radius of this imaginary circle.

Is there some standard result in number theory that applies to situations like this? After several years, it appears this is an open problem. As a non-number theorist, I had assumed there would be known results that would answer the question. I was aware of the difficulty in proving various constants to be transcendental -- such as $e + \pi$, which is not known to be transcendental at present. However, I was looking at a question that seems simpler, naively: whether a number is an integer, rather than whether it is transcendental.  It seems that what appeared to be possibly simpler is actually not, with current techniques. The main motivation for asking about this particular number is that it is very large. It is certainly possible to find a pair of very large numbers, at least one of which is transcendental. But the current lack of knowledge about this particular number is even an integer shows just how much progress remains to be made, in my opinion.

Let $E_n, n=1,2,3,\ldots$ be a sequence of countable sets, and put $S=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n$. Then $S$ is countable. Proof. Let every set $E_n$ be arranged in a sequence $x_{nk}, k=1,2,3,\ldots$, and consider the infinite array $$\begin{array}{cccc}
x_{11}&x_{12}&x_{13}&\cdots\\
x_{21}&x_{22}&x_{23}&\cdots\\
x_{31}&x_{32}&x_{33}&\cdots\\
\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots
\end{array}$$
  in which elements of $E_n$ form the $n$th row. The array contains all elements of $S$. As indicated by the arrows in this picture — — these elements can be arranged in a sequence $$x_{11};x_{21},x_{12};x_{31},x_{22},x_{13};x_{41},x_{32},x_{23},x_{14};\ldots.\qquad(17)$$
  If any two of the sets $E_n$ have elements in common, these will appear more than once in $(17)$. Hence there is a subset $T$ of the set of all positive integers such that $S\sim T$, which shows that $S$ is at most countable (Theorem 2.8). Since $E_1\subset S$ and $E_1$ is infinite, $S$ is infinite, and thus countable.

However, there are still problems that are easy on ring of polynomials and yet seem to be hard on integers. For example, factoring a polynomial is easy while factoring over the integer is one of the hardness assumption. Similarly, the polynomial variant of finding shortest vector for lattices is easy while it is hard over a lattice over integers. Again the polynomial variant of prime number theorem if proven in the case of integer will actually give a proof of Riemann Hypothesis . This list goes on and on.

91561,Can the fundamental theorem of calculus be proved without an appeal to mean value or Rolle's theorem or its immediate consequences?,"I think the answer is in the negative. Here are two of the ways I know. Both of them use
the Mean Value Theorem. The first one use in an indirect way, and the second uses
it more forthrightly. The first proof goes something like this. Prove that $F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt, a \le x \le b$ is a particular anti derivative and if $G$ is an anti derivative that is $G^\prime =(x) = f(x)$. Then apply the Mean Value Theorem to $F-G$ on any interval $(c,d) \subset (a,b)$ to conclude that $F(c) - G(d) = 0$. Now keep $c$ fixed and move $d$ in the interval
$[a, b]$. Use $F(b) - G(b) = F(a)-G(a)$ to conclude $G(b) - G(a) = F(b) - F(a) = F(b) = \int_a^b f(x)dx$. The second proof, which I prefer, goes something like this: $G(b) - G(a) = \int dG = (G(b) - G(x_{n-1})) + (G(x_{n-1}-G(x_{n-2}) )+ \ldots (G(x_1) - G(a))$ for any partition $\{a, x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_{n-1}, b \}$ of $[a, b] $. Now
you use the Mean Value Theorem to write replace each term $G(x_k) - G(x_{k-1})$
by $G^\prime(c_k)(x_k - x_{k-1})$ to get a Riemann sum which converges to $\int_a^b f(x)dx $. I think one has to use some sort of theorem like mvt which gives you global information $f(b) - f(a)$ of $f$ using the derivative which can only provide local information on $f$.",['calculus']

91700,In what senses are archimedean places infinite?,"According to Bjorn Poonen's notes here (§2.6), we should add the archimedean places of a number field $K$ to $\operatorname{Spec} \mathscr{O}_K$ in order to get a good analogy with smooth projective algebraic curves. This suggests that the archimedean places are infinite in the sense of being ‘points at infinity’ and not just because rational integers become arbitrarily ‘large’. Is there any reason to expect this, i.e. was there some intuition that the archimedean places were the points needed to make $\operatorname{Spec} \mathscr{O}_K$ complete in some sense?

$$\{ x \in K : \left| x \right|_v \le 1 \}$$

Show that $f$ takes all complex values. My idea is: Assuming there is some $b$ s.th. there is no $a$ with $f(a)=b$, then define the function $g:=f-b$, so then $g$ will be entire (since it's an entire function just shifted), and $g$ will never be zero. But that is a contradiction since an entire function can be written by definition as a polynomial, and any polynomial has a root somewhere, so $g=0$ somewhere, so $f=b$ somewhere, contradiction. But there is little Picard's theorem that tells us an entire function omits at most one value. Now suddenly I seem to show that it omits no value. And the fact that the set of zeros is finite but nonempty is only used, basically, to say that $f$ is not constant in the first place. So where is the mistake? Best regards,",['complex-analysis']

I just know Cantor's diagonalization method for proving some cardinality stuff. Unfortunately I don't see how this apply in this situation. I'm aware of asking a very general thing, but hopefully it's clear what I try to ask. Just to be sure that there's no misunderstanding, here is an example: Suppose $X$ is a separable space and $(\phi_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a bounded subset of the dual of $X$ (topological dual). Then there is a subsequence $\Omega \subset \mathbb{N}$ and an element $\phi \in X^* $ such that $ \phi_k $ converges weak$^*$ to $\phi$ for this subsequence. Now in the proof, we argue: let $(x_n)$ be dense in $X$. Then looking at $ \phi_k(x_1) $. This is bounded sequence in $ \mathbb{R} $ therefore it exists a subset $\Omega_1 \subset \mathbb{N} $ such that $\phi_k(x_1)$ converges for $ k\in \Omega_1$. Repeating this for ever $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we get an decreasing family of subsets (subsequence) of $\mathbb{N}$, $$\mathbb{N}\supset \Omega_1 \supset \dots \supset \Omega_l \dots \supset \Omega$$ Why can I do this? Should I choose a subsequence of $\Omega_l$ using Bolzano-Weierstrass to get $\Omega_{l+1}$? Why do I know there's a $\Omega$ ?
