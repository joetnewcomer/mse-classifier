1934598,How many natural solutions to $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 24$ if $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > x_4 + x_5 + x_6$?,Here's a problem in my combinatorics textbook: Find how many solutions exist to the following equation over the natural numbers $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 24$$ if $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > x_4 + x_5 + x_6$$ I think that the problem can be solved with a generating function. First because $x_1+x_2+x_3>x_4+x_5+x_6$ then we can deduce that $x_1+x_2+x_3=x_4+x_5+x_6+y$ where $y\ge1$ because by problem definition we're dealing with natural numbers. Thus we get the following: $2x_4+2x_5+2x_6+y=24$ which translates into the following function: $$(1+x^2+x^4+...)^3(x+x^2+x^3+...)=(1+x^2+x^4+...)^3x(1+x+x^2+x^3+...)=$$ $$=\frac{1}{(1-x^2)^3}*\frac{1}{1-x}$$ now we need to find the coefficient of $x^{23}$ . Is the correct solution so far and if yes is there any closed form of the generating function or any other tip to find the coefficient or I should just open the brackets by brute force?,"['diophantine-equations', 'combinatorics', 'generating-functions']"

1934650,Is there a unique finitely additive extension of a countably additive product probability measure to the product $\sigma$-algebra for finite products?,"Consider a finite collection of measure spaces $\{(A_i, \mathcal{A}_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ where each $\mathcal{A}_i$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the algebra on $\prod_{i=1}^N A_i$ generated by the sets of the form $B_1\times\cdots\times B_N$ with $B_i \in \mathcal{A}_i$. Suppose that for each $i$ we have a countably additive probability measure $\tau_i$ on $\mathcal{A}_i$. Let $\tau$ be the measure on $\mathcal{A}$ defined by 
$$\tau(B_1\times\cdots\times B_N) = \tau_1(B_1)\times\cdots\times\tau_N(B_N)$$
when $B_i \in \mathcal{A}_i$ for each $i$. The measure $\tau$ is countably additive on $\mathcal{A}$, so the Carathéodory extension theorem lets us extend $\tau$ to a countably additive measure (which we will call $\hat{\tau}$) on $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$. The extension $\hat{\tau}$ is the only countably additive extension of $\tau$ and it is a probability measure. My question: Is $\hat{\tau}$ the only finitely additive extension of $\tau$ to a probability measure on $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$? What if each $A_i$ is a separable metric space with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra? Note : By probability measure I mean a non-negative, finitely additive set function that assigns $1$ to the whole space. I.e, probability measure does not assume countable additivity. Second note : The answer to the question is yes when each $A_i$ is countable and $\mathcal{A}_i$ is the discrete $\sigma$-algebra. The reason is that we are able to write each set in $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$ as a countable union of sets in $\mathcal{A}$: Let $\mu$ be some finitely additive extension of $\tau$ to a probability measure. Since $\mu$ is a probability measure, it is monotone. Then, for any $B \in \sigma(\mathcal{A})$,
$$\mu(B) \geq \sum_{b \in B} \tau(\{b\}) = \hat{\tau}(B)$$
and the same argument shows that $\mu(B^c) \geq \hat{\tau}(B^c)$. Since $\hat\tau$ and $\mu$ are finitely additive and assign probability $1$ to $A$, this implies that $\mu(B) = \hat{\tau}(B)$. Third note : The second note implies that the answer is yes when each $\tau_i$ is a (finite or countable) sum of point masses since we can just ignore all of the other points. An almost proof that the answer is yes : In Finitely Additive Measures by Yosida and Hewitt, Theorem 1.23 says that any non-negative finitely additive measure $\phi$ has a unique decomposition $\phi = \phi_c + \phi_p$ where $\phi_c$ is countably additive and non-negative and $\phi_p$ is purely finitely additive and non-negative. The measure $\phi_p$ being purely finitely additive means (for non-negative measures) that if $\psi$ is any countably additive measure with $0\leq\psi\leq \phi_p$, then $\psi = 0$. In our situation, we might conjecture that if $\tau'$ is any probability measure extending $\tau$, then $\tau'_c = \hat{\tau}$. This would mean that $\tau'_p(A) = 0$, so $\tau'_p = 0$. The important thing here was that we knew that $\tau'_p \geq 0$.","['functional-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1934790,Do the Taylor series of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ depend on the identity $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x =1$?,"I had this crazy idea trying to prove the Pythagorean trigonometric identity;$$\sin^2x+\cos^2x=1$$by squaring the infinite Taylor series of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$. But it came out quite beautiful, involving also a combinatorics identitie. The proof: $$\sin x=\frac{x}{1}-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!}+...=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}\\\\\sin^2x=x^2-x^4\left (\frac{1}{1!3!}+\frac{1}{3!1!}\right )+x^6\left (\frac{1}{1!5!}+\frac{1}{3!3!}+\frac{1}{5!1!}\right )-...\\\\\cos x=1-\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}-\frac{x^6}{6!}+...=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!}\\\\\cos^2x\!=\!1\!-\!x^2\left(\!\frac{1}{0!2!}\!+\!\frac{1}{2!0!}\!\right)\!+\!x^4\left(\!\frac{1}{0!4!}\!+\!\frac{1}{2!2!}\!+\!\frac{1}{4!0!}\!\right)\!-\!x^6\left(\!\frac{1}{0!6!}\!+\!\frac{1}{2!4!}\!+\!\frac{1}{4!2!}\!+\!\frac{1}{6!0!}\!\right)\!+...$$We should have shown that the series for both $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ converge absolutely (since we changed the arrangement), but it's obvious since the absolute value of all terms of $\sin x+\cos x$ add up to $e^x$.$$\sin^2x+\cos^2x=\\=1-x^2\left(\frac{1}{0!2!}-\frac{1}{1!1!}+\frac{1}{2!0!}\right)+x^4\left(\frac{1}{0!4!}-\frac{1}{1!3!}+\frac{1}{2!2!}-\frac{1}{3!1!}+\frac{1}{4!0!}\right)-x^6\left(\frac{1}{0!6!}-\frac{1}{1!5!}+\frac{1}{2!4!}-\frac{1}{3!3!}+\frac{1}{4!2!}-\frac{1}{5!1!}+\frac{1}{6!0!}\right)+...=\\\\=1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^nx^{2n}\sum_{k=0}^{2n}\frac{(-1)^k\binom{2n}{k}}{(2n)!}$$
Since we can show easily that $\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i\binom{n}{i}=0$ by expanding $(1-1)^n$ using Binom's formula. So:$$\sin^2x+\cos^2x=1-0+0-0+...=1$$ I think it's beautiful. I just wanted to ask, do Taylor's series of those functions depend on this identity? Because if they do, the proof will be circular.","['combinatorics', 'taylor-expansion', 'trigonometry', 'power-series']"

1934888,"How to intuitively understand why for a sequence of a sets $A_n$, $\liminf_{n}A_n \subseteq\limsup_{n}A_n$?","I am trying to understand exactly why for a sequence of sets $A_n$, $\liminf_{n}A_n \subseteq\limsup_{n}A_n$. My understanding is that a member of
$$
\liminf_{n}A_n =\bigcup_{N=1}^\infty \bigcap_{n\ge N} A_n
$$
is a member of at least one of the sets
$$
\bigcap_{n\ge N} A_n,
$$
so that it is a member of all but finitely many $A_n$. A member of
$$
\bigcap_{N=1}^\infty \bigcup_{n\ge N} A_n
$$
is a member of every one of the sets
$$
\bigcup_{n\ge N} A_n,
$$
So, my understanding is that it is a member of infinitely many of them, but that there may be infinitely many sets it is not a member of, since if I were to ""put"" some element inside $A_{100000}$, then all the union sets that came before have membership. However, what confuses me is why the first case is a proper subset of the second case. It seems that in BOTH the limit infimum and limit supremum case, an element of each would be an element of infinitely many $A_n$. However, in the limit supremum case, it is possible that an element only comes up every, say 1 trillion times. Then, my element is in $A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ldots$, and $A_2 \cup A_3 \cup \ldots$, BUT, it is not in the sequence of sets until the trillionth case. In contrast, because the limit infimum deals with the intersection, the restrictions seem tighter in that an element needs to be in each and every one of them expect for finitely many. In total, it seems that the limit infimum case appears more populated and less sparse than the limit supremum case. Can anyone tell me where my logic went wrong here? thanks!!","['limsup-and-liminf', 'probability', 'elementary-set-theory']"

1934931,Bijection between $SO(3)$ and $S^2\times S^1$,"$SO(3)$ and $S^2\times S^1$ are in a set bijection because of having the same cardinality. Tapp in his Matrix groups book informally ""defines"" $SO(3)$ as ""all positions of a globe on a fixed stand"" and then asks: Question Is there a natural bijection between $SO(3)$ and $S^2\times S^1$? When I was reading this I thought the answer should be Yes, because each position of a (unit) globe is determined by first placing the north pole at its correct place, say $p$, and then applying a rotation to the globe around $OP$. However, later in the book Tapp writes: $SO(3)$ is not homeomorphic to $S^2\times S^1$ which implies a negative answer to the Question . I understand that the author has intentionally been vague at the beginning of the book, but I still wonder whether the map that I have described above can count as at least a discontinuous (natural) bijection between $S^2\times S^1$ and $SO(3)$. As a separate, but related question, what are the most elementary (resp. quickest) ways of seeing that $S^2\times S^1$ and $SO(3)$ are not homeomorphic or diffeomorphic.

So let's begin calculating the partial derivatives: $$\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$$ $$\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 2u\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$$ therefore $$\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial y}$$ Now, the other condition: $$\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 2u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$ $$\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}= 2u\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$$ which implies in: $$\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial y}$$ Did I do it right?

How do I determine adjacency between vertices? Is it the edges that determine this attribute for a vertex? For g8 - there are 5 new numbers added aside from 1,2 and 3. (4,5,6,7,8) and we want the number of possibilities where order doesn't matter and repetition is not allowed from a pool of 5 numbers for 3 positions. (5c3) 456 457 458 468 467 478 578 568 567 678 iv) makes it clear that a triangle is 3 vertexes with an edge between each vertex. g8 doesn't have 9 unique values and since an edge requires the 3 points to be unique between sets, there will be at most 2 edges between any set of 3 vertices - we want 3. g9, with its 9 disintct values, can however have triangles. This one I'm still trying to figure out I tried going about it as such - given (1,2,3) we have 6 values with 6 spots to choose from remaining. The first 3 can be chosen 6C3 ways and the last 3 3C3 ways. So by the rule of product we have (6C3)(3C3) ways of getting a triangle for the point (1,2,3). - Which isn't right because we consider (123)(456)(789) and (123)(789)(456) to be the same triangle. So 6C3 /2. But then (789)(123)(456), (789)(456)(123) and also  (456)(123)(789),  (456)(789)(123) are all the same triangle as the one above, just with a different starting vertex. So for every triangle theres 6 different ways of obtaining it. if we have 9C3 ways of choosing the first 3 numbers and theres 6 identical triangles for each set of 3 beginning values - then there is a total of 9C3 of choosing unique first values. Each value has 10 different triangles - and the overlap is shared with 6 other combinations of values. So how many triangles are there?

When comparing two subsets $A,B \subseteq [n]$ at a particular $k$th entry, there are $4$ possibilities: 1) both $A$ and $B$ have a $1$ at the $k$th entry, 2) $A$ has a $0$ and $B$ has a $1$ at the $k$th entry, 3) $A$ has a $1$ and $B$ has a $0$ at the $k$th entry, 4) both $A$ and $B$ have a $0$ at the $k$th entry. Since $0\leq k \leq n$ then there are $4^n$ possibilities in total. However, for each $k$ only one possibility contributes to the sum, namely possibility (1), so we must divide by 4 to count each of the four possibilities as $1$, which is how I believe we have $4^{n-1}$. Maybe this is a bogus explanation but I fail to see where the $n$ comes from.","['combinatorics', 'summation', 'discrete-mathematics']"

1935724,Why is Axiom of Choice required for the proof of countable union of countable sets is countable?,"I know that this question has been asked a lot here, some of them are duplicate of each other. I’ve read every single of them, but my problem has not been resolved. I can just memorize that Axiom of Choice (AC) is needed, but I want to be clear of this, logically. Note : “Countable” here means infinitely countable. Recall the proof, it goes like this: First, I have countably many of countable sets. Let me enumerate them to $\langle A_i\rangle_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$. For each $i$, $A_i$ is countable. Since $A_i$ is countable for each $i$, there exists a bijection $h_i:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow A_i$ for each $i$. Then this is where Axiom of Choice (AC) comes into play. There are countably many $A_i$, so I have to choose ‘countably many’ times. Then I’ve got $h_i:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow A_i$ for each $i$ I want. But why is AC needed? What I understand about AC is, if I have a collection of non-empty sets, and I want to construct a new set by picking an element from each set in the collection, then AC allows me to pick them to ‘construct’ my new set. This is explicitly stated in its logical formula. For example, if I have a collection $\mathcal{A}=\lbrace A_i\rbrace_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ where $A_i$ is non-empty for each $i$ and I want to construct a new set $\lbrace a_i\rbrace_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that $a_i\in A_i$ for each $i$, then I need AC to guarantee that such set can be made. However, if my collection $\mathcal{A}=\lbrace A_i\rbrace_{i=0}^n$ is finite, then I can construct the new set without AC, i.e., it can be proved that such $\lbrace a_i\rbrace$ can be constructed without the need of AC. But what I don’t understand is, why am I not even permitted to just pick an element and manipulate them? Return to the same example, if I have a collection $\mathcal{A}=\lbrace A_i\rbrace_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ where $A_i$ is non-empty for each $i$, then I know that there exists $a_i\in A_i$ for each $i$. Am I permitted to manipulate $a_i$ for each $i$?, like constructing $\lbrace a_i\rbrace$ by the Axiom of Pair? Can I construct a set $A_i’:=A_i-\lbrace a_i\rbrace$ for each $i$? Each $a_i$ exists logically, and I want to put bracket around them like this $\lbrace a_i\rbrace$. This is allowed by the Axiom of Pair. Of course, I cannot make $\lbrace a_i\rbrace_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ since this is not implied by any axiom (even by the Axiom of Union or Axiom of Infinity) except AC. Most answer I found here is, I cannot even 'pick' an element from each set infinitely many times without AC (not to mention constructing a new set from them). Some people even said that each $A_i$ in the proof being countable does not mean that its enumeration is given. Well, in that case, can't I just say that since it does not have enumeration, then it's not countable and hence a contradiction to the assumption? An enumeration must exists. Some might say that it exists but is not given. Then what does 'given' mean in logic? Even in the proof that utilizes AC, we claim that a choice function exists, but not clearly stated 'which' choice function. We only know that it exists and use it to finish the proof. Why is this situation is different from knowing that each bijection $h_i$ exists for each $i$. Why are we permitted to manipulate existing choice function, but not allowed to manipulate existing bijection? Is this related to the fact that it is formulated in First-order logic?

1935730,Linear separation theorem for closed convex sets of measures,"Let $\mathcal P([0, 1])$ be the space of all probability measures on $[0, 1]$ endowed with the total variation metric. Let $P\subseteq \mathcal P([0, 1])$ be its closed convex subset, and $p'$ a measure that lies outside of it. Does there exist a bounded Borel-measurable function $f:[0,1]\to \Bbb R$ such that 
$$
  p'f > \sup\limits_{p\in P} pf.
$$ 
It seems that Hahn–Banach separation theorem can be applied here, but I am not sure in which way exactly. Update: The answer to the original question is negative, unless we use a refined version of convexity that I had in mind initially, but did not put in the beginning, hoping that the usual definition of convexity would suffice. Unfortunately, it also means that Hahn-Banach separation theorem cannot be readily applied to my case. First, why the original question has negative answer. Let $P$ be the closure (in total variation) of all discrete measures on $[0, 1]$ with finite support. No absolutely continuous measure belongs to $P$ since they are mutually singular with discrete measures. Yet, for any measure $p'$ and any given function $f$ we cna always construct a sequence of discrete measures $p_n$ such that $\sup_n p_nf \geq p'f$. Second, instead of usual convexity I am working with barycentric convexity. A measurable set of measures $P\subseteq \mathcal P([0, 1])$ is said to be barycentrcially convex if for any measure $\nu \in \mathcal P(\mathcal P([0, 1]))$ such that $\nu(P) = 1$ it holds that $\int_P \mu \;\nu(\mathrm d\mu)\in P$. So, instead of only taking convex combinations with finite weights (like in usual convexity) we are allowed to take any possible linear combinations. So my question should read as: if $P$ is a barycentrically convex, closed (in TV) subset of $\mathcal P([0,1])$... In this formulation the previous counterexample does not apply: the set of all discrete measures is not barycentrically closed, in fact its barycentric closure consists of all measures.","['functional-analysis', 'probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'convex-analysis']"
1935772,Are there linear transformations from vector spaces over different fields?,"I'm in a matrix theory class, and today we started talking about linear transformations.

But then I thought that maybe some fields might be compatible, like for example, $\mathbb{Z}_5$ and $\mathbb{Z}_7$ Are there any linear transformations for two spaces over different fields? or Are there functions that have all the same properties as linear transformations except that the spaces involved use different fields?

What we have done is exhibit three orthogonal bases for the same space ($L^2[0,L]$). One orthogonal basis is the set of functions $\sin(n \pi x/L)$ . A second orthogonal basis is the set of functions $\sin(2n\pi x/L)$ together with the functions $\cos(2n\pi x/L)$. Closely related to the second basis is the third basis $\{\exp(2n\pi xi /L)\}$ with $n$ now ranging from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.

1936005,"Subnets and compactness in $\{ 0, \dots, 9 \}^{[0,1]}$","I'm going over my knowledge of nets in preparation for some more work in functional analysis, and I came across an area of knowledge which I thought I had understood, but now seems a little flaky. The set $\{ 0, \dots, 9 \}^{[0,1]}$ is compact with the product topology, since it is the product of finite discrete (and therefore compact) sets. Therefore every net contains a convergent subnet. This is the classical example where sequential compactness fails, because if we take the sequence $$ f_k(x) = \text{The $k$'th element of the binary expansion of x} $$ Then there is no convergent subsequence $f_{i_k}$, because we can always take the number $$ y = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k + 1}{10^{i_k}} $$ and $f_{i_k}(y)$ alternates between 0 and 2, and hence cannot converge. Now the theory of nets tells us that there must exist a subnet $\mathfrak{a} = f_{i_\alpha}$ which converges in this set, where $i$ is an order preserving map from the directed set which forms the domain of $\mathfrak{a}$ to $\mathbf{N}$. If we then take the elements $i_1 < i_2 < \dots$ which form the image of $i$ in $\mathbf{N}$ how does the construction of $y$ fail here? Can one construct a convergent subnet for this sequence explicitly?","['functional-analysis', 'general-topology', 'nets', 'compactness']"

1936200,Can a multi-perfect number be a perfect square?,"It is fairly easy to show that a perfect number $\Gamma$ cannot be written in the form $\Gamma=n^2$ for integer values of $n$. However, does this property hold true for multi-perfect numbers---that is, integers $R$ such that $\sigma(R)=kR,$ for $k>2$? This question is out of pure curiosity, as I can not find an answer online. UPDATE: I now know that for even $k$ and/or an even $k$-perfect number $R$ the answer is no, as it follows from contradiction by assuming $R=n^2$ and then computing $$\sigma(R)=\prod_{i=1}^{l}\sigma(p_i^{2a_i}), $$ where $n=\prod_{i=1}^lp_i^{a_i}$ (here all $p_i$ are distinct primes and all $a_i\geq1$). Given this result, my question is now whether the same is true for odd $k$ and, assuming they exist, an odd $k$-perfect number $Q$. That is, if both $k$ and $Q$ are odd in $\sigma(Q)=kQ,$ is there a way to show that $Q$ cannot be a perfect square? I believe this could be done by considering the number of divisors of $Q=\prod_{i=1}^rp_i^{a_i}$---given by $$d(Q)=\prod_{i=1}^r(a_i+1)$$ and showing that at least one $a_i\equiv1\pmod2,$ but I have not found any results similar to this online.","['number-theory', 'reference-request', 'perfect-numbers', 'square-numbers']"

1936266,Where are the other solutions to this ODE disappearing in this analysis?,"I am asked to solve the following ODE involving constants $\alpha, L, V_0 > 0$ and $E < 0$: $$-\psi'' - \alpha V_0\psi\cdot [\delta(x)+\delta(x-L)] = \alpha E\psi.$$ In particular, we want solutions $\psi:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{C}$ that are: Continuous $L^2$ We are given that the solutions look something like this (shifted): Now pretend we didn't know this. Here is my attempt at arriving at these functions: Away from $0$ and $L$, the ODE is just the wave equation, whose solutions are always of the form $a_1e^{-i\sqrt{\alpha E}x}+a_2e^{i\sqrt{\alpha E}x}.$ So we know $\psi$ is also of this form piece-wise:
  $$\psi(x)=\left\lbrace \begin{array}{ll}
    A_1e^{\sqrt{|\alpha E|}x}+A_2e^{-\sqrt{|\alpha E|}x} & x<0 \\
    B_1e^{\sqrt{|\alpha E|}x}+B_2e^{-\sqrt{|\alpha E|}x} & 0\leq x< L \\
    C_1e^{\sqrt{|\alpha E|}x}+C_2e^{-\sqrt{|\alpha E|}x} & x\geq  L \\
\end{array} \right.$$
  (I expanded a little here, since $E<0\Rightarrow \sqrt{\alpha E}=i\sqrt{|\alpha E|}$) For $\psi$ to be integrable, we also need the exponentials with infinite > support be integrable. Then $A_2=C_1=0.$ Then we can simplify it:
  $$\psi(x)=\left\lbrace \begin{array}{ll}
    A_1e^{\sqrt{|\alpha E|}x} & x<0 \\
    B_1e^{\sqrt{|\alpha E|}x}+B_2e^{-\sqrt{|\alpha E|}x} & 0\leq x< L \\
    C_2e^{-\sqrt{|\alpha E|}x}& x\geq L \\
\end{array} \right.$$
  All that's left to do is to find the space of coefficients $A_i,B_i,C_i$ so that it is continuous and satisfies the DE. For $\psi$ to be continuous, $\lim_{x\to 0^+}\psi(x)=\lim_{x\to 0^-}\psi(x)$ and likewise at $L$. So $A_1=B_1+B_2,$ and a similar equation at $L.$ To satisfty the ODE at $0$ and $L$, because of the deltas, we know that the derivative must have a discintinuity of size $-\alpha V_0 \psi$ there. In particular: $(\lim_{x\to 0^+}\psi'(x))-(\lim_{x\to 0^-}\psi'(x))=-\alpha V_0 \psi(0),$ so computing these terms, $(\sqrt{|\alpha E|}B_1 - \sqrt{|\alpha E|}B_2)- (\sqrt{|\alpha E|}A_1) = -\alpha V_0A_1$. We have a similar equation at $L$. Now we have 4 equations relating all the coefficients to each other. I solved this system and plotted the solutions. The problem is, varying values of $\alpha, L, V_0, E$, I can only get solutions that look like the 'even' graph.

1936273,"Definition of complex differential forms of bidegree $(p,q)$","Let $M$ be a complex manifold of dimension $n$. It means that $M$ is a real smooth smooth manifold of dimension $2n$. Suppose that the real tangent bundle of $M$ has a local basis:
$$\left\{\frac{\partial }{\partial x_1},\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n},\frac{\partial }{\partial y_1},\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial y_n}\right\}$$
and the real cotangent bundle has local basis
$$\left\{dx_1,\ldots,dx_n,dy_1,\ldots dy_n\right\}$$ Then we put $$\frac{\partial}{\partial z_j}:=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x_j}-i \frac{\partial }{\partial y_j}\right)$$ 
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar z_j}:=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x_j}+i \frac{\partial }{\partial y_j}\right)$$
$$dz_j:=dx_j+idy_j$$
$$d\bar z_j:=dx_j-idy_j$$ Now consider the complexified cotangent bundle $(T^\ast M)_{\mathbb C}$, it has a decomposition:
$$(T^\ast M)_\mathbb C:=T^\ast M^{1,0}\oplus T^\ast M^{0.1}$$ where $$T^\ast M^{(1,0)}=\left<dz_j:j=1,\ldots n\right>$$ $$T^\ast M^{(1,0)}=\left<d\bar z_j:j=1,\ldots n\right>\,.$$ At this point one defines the algebra of differential $(p,q)$-forms on $M$ as:
$$\bigwedge^{p,q}M:=\bigwedge^{p}T^\ast M^{1,0}\otimes \bigwedge^{q}T^\ast M^{0,1}$$ So locally any $(p,q)$-differential form can be written as $$\omega=\sum_{i_1<\ldots<i_p} \alpha_{i_1,\ldots,i_p}dz_{i_1}\wedge\ldots\wedge dz_{i_p}\otimes \sum_{j_1<\ldots<j_q}\beta_{i_1,\ldots,i_q}d\bar z_{j_1}\wedge\ldots\wedge d\bar z_{j_q}\,.$$ So why in every textbook a $(p,q)$-dffierential form is written simply as:
  $$\omega=\sum \alpha_{i_1,\ldots,i_p}dz_{i_1}\wedge\ldots\wedge dz_{i_p}\wedge d\bar z_{j_1}\wedge\ldots\wedge d\bar z_{j_q}\;\;?$$

1936331,Why the chevalley $G/B$ and plucker $G/B$ are isomorphic $G$- projective varieties,"Let $G$ be an algebraic group acting transitively on closed projective varieties $X$ and $Y$.  Let $X \xrightarrow{f} Y$ be a bijective continuous map, that is $G-$equivariant.  Does it follow that $X \to Y$ is an isomorphism of algebraic varieties? It seems roughly intuitive because if the derivative of this map is zero somewhere then it should be zero everywhere by the equivariance. If there is a transversality proof that is easier for $G$-manifolds and diffeomorphisms, or if it easier to prove it for complex algebraic varieties and biholomorphisms, i'd be all for it. My motivation: 
There are two structures as a projective variety, that one can put on $GL(n)/B$ where $B$ is the Borel subgroup(which I define as a maximal connnected solvable subgroup of $GL(n)$). Structure one:  One can use Chevalley's theorem to define what $G/B$ means as a quasiprojective variety:  its an orbit in $P(W)$ for some $G$ module $W$, which is therefore open in its closure.  Then one can show that its closed $P(W)$ because $B$ is solvable, and orbits of minimal dimension are closed.  Therefore $GL/B$ is a closed orbit in $P(W)$. Structure two:  There is a bijection of $G-$sets between $GL(n)/B$ and $Flag(\mathbb{C}^n)$.  There is a closed embedding of this into a product of grassmanians, and grassmanians are closed subvarieties of projective space by plucker.  So $GL(n)/B$ can be regarded as a closed subspace of $P(\wedge^1 \mathbb{C^n} \otimes ...\wedge^{n-1} \mathbb{C^n})$. I want to know 'Why are these $G$-varieties isomorphic as projective varieties?' and the question above would allow me to answer this. What I have got from professors:  A professor at tea told me that I need to use the correspondence between maps from projective space and line bundles over the domain.
Brainstorming:  Maybe I need to use something about $G$ equivariant line bundles over $G/B$ since these will correspond to $G$-equivariant maps from $G/B$..  Borel-weil-bott theorem anyone?","['algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request', 'algebraic-groups', 'differential-geometry', 'lie-groups']"

One of the questions on a practice quiz (for the online course, not a problem from an official AP practice test) is as follows: Suppose a friend of yours gives you a graph of $y=f(x)$, and asks you to graph the function $y=-f(2(x-3))+4$. How would you go about doing this? The choices are: A. Start with the graph of $y=f(x)$, flip it over, squash it horizontally by a factor of 2, shift it 3 units to the right and 4 units up. B. Start with the graph of $y=f(x)$, shift it 3 units to the right and 4 units up, then squash it horizontally by a factor of 2, and finally flip it over vertically. C. Start with the graph of $y=f(x)$, squash it horizontally by a factor of 2, flip it over, shift it 3 units to the right and 4 units up. D. Start with the graph of $y=f(x)$, shift it 3 units to the left and 4 units up, then squash it horizontally by a factor of 2, and finally flip it over vertically. E. Start with the graph of $y=f(x)$, shift 4 units up, squash it horizontally by a factor of 2, flip it vertically, and finally shift it 3 units to the right. The quiz says the correct answer is B. It gives the following ""Feedback"": ""Remember to shift first, then stretch or squash, and then flip."" I think answer B is wrong. I think the correct answer should be C. A few drawings support my claim. I know that the order in which we carry out the transformations matters. I think B is wrong because if we shift horizontally before we squash horizontally, we actually need to shift SIX units right, not three. If we squash first, however, as in C, we only need to shift three units. On the other hand, maybe the issue is exactly what ""squash horizontally"" is supposed to mean. My understanding is that when we transform $y=f(x)$ into $y=f(2x)$, the graph gets squashed only because the entire plane gets squashed: all points $(x,y)$ get moved to $(x/2,y)$, and this causes the shape of the graph to look squashed relative to the original. So we're squashing about the line $x=0$. I think the teacher is mistakenly using this phrase to mean ""squash about the line $x=3$."" Who is right? Am I right that C could be the correct answer on some reasonable interpretation of ""squash horizontally by a factor of 2""?","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions', 'graphing-functions']"

Which of the following is true about the standard deviation? The standard deviation will increase, because we have increased the value of a data point. The standard deviation will stay the same, because the standard deviation is not affected by a change in a single measurement. The standard deviation will decrease, because this change moved a data point closer to the mean.",['statistics']

1936898,What is backward reasoning in logic proofs? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Is it okay to reverse engineer proofs in homework questions? (5 answers) Closed 9 months ago . I was reading about Backward Reasoning, but I was not able to figure out how it works and what it really is. While reading I came across the following example mentioned in Kenneth Rosen book. Question: Given two positive real numbers x and y, their arithmetic mean is (x + y)/2 and their geometric mean is √xy . When we compare the arithmetic and geometric means of pairs of distinct positive real numbers, we find that the arithmetic mean is always greater than the geometric mean. [For example, when x = 4 and y = 6, we have 5 = (4 + 6)/2 > √4 · 6 =√24.] Can we prove that this inequality is always true? Solution: To prove that (x + y)/2 > √xy when x and y are distinct positive real numbers , we can work backward. We construct a sequence
of equivalent inequalities. The equivalent inequalities are (x + y)/2 > √xy, (x + y) 2 /4 > xy, (x + y) 2 > 4xy, x 2 + 2xy + y 2 > 4xy, x 2 − 2xy + y 2 > 0, (x − y) 2 > 0. Because (x − y) 2 > 0 when x != y , it follows that the
final inequality is true. Because all these inequalities are
equivalent, it follows that (x + y)/2 > √xy when x != y . Once we have
carried out this backward reasoning, we can easily reverse the steps
to construct a proof using forward reasoning. We now give this proof. Suppose that x and y are distinct positive real numbers. Then (x − y) 2 > 0 because the square of a nonzero real number is positive. Because (x − y) 2 =  x 2 - 2xy + y 2 > 0 . Adding 4xy to both sides, we obtain x 2 + 2xy + y 2 > 4xy . Because x 2 + 2xy + y 2 = (x + y) 2 , this means that (x + y) 2 ≥ 4xy . Dividing both sides of this equation by 4, we see that (x + y) 2 /4 > xy . Finally, taking square roots of both sides (which preserves the inequality because both sides are positive) yields (x + y)/2 > √xy . We conclude that if x and y are distinct positive real numbers, then their arithmetic mean (x + y)/2 is greater than their geometric mean √xy . I didn't understand this proof. This proof is like if you have to prove a = b, then you add 5 both sides and get a+5 = b+5. Now using forward reasoning you prove a = b. Correct me if I am wrong.
Also, please illustrate how backward reasoning works.You can use appropriate examples.

My thought is that if I can show that the derivative $f'(a)(b)$ is invertible for all $s \in S_n^+(\mathbb{R})$, then I will have shown that there is a positive definite square root that varies smoothly with $s$. Since $s$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix, we know that it has $n$ eigenvectors with positive eigenvalues. Further, we know that 
$$f'(a)(b) = ab + ba$$ $$ ab + ba = 0 $$
$$ abb^T + bab^T = 0 $$ Suppose that $b$ has non-zero entries. We know that $a, bb^T$ are both positive definite matrices, and we know that diagonal entries of $bab^T$ are positive, since they are equal to $b_iab_i^T$, which is positive because $a$ is positive definite.

1936947,Is the sum of two tight sequences tight?,"Suppose that $X_n$ and $Y_n$ are sequences of random elements defined on the same probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal F,P)$ and taking values in some separable Hilbert space $H$ (I am particularly interested in the case when $H=L^2([0,1],\mathbb R)$). We say that the sequence $X_n$ is tight if for each $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a compact subset $K_\varepsilon$ of $H$ such that
$$
P(X_n\in K_\varepsilon)\ge1-\varepsilon
$$
for each $n\ge1$. Suppose that the sequences $X_n$ and $Y_n$ are tight. Is the sequence $X_n+Y_n$ tight? If $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are independent for each $i\ge1$, the following proof seems to work. Let $H\times H$ denote the Cartesian product of the Hilbert space $H$ with itself. The inner-product of $H\times H$ is given by
$$
\langle (f,g),(h,k)\rangle_{H\times H}=\langle f,h\rangle_H+\langle g,k\rangle_H.
$$
Then the sequence $(X_n,Y_n)$ with values in $H\times H$ is also tight since the Cartesian product of two compact sets is a compact set and we have that
\begin{align*}
	P((X_n,Y_n)\in K_\varepsilon\times T_\varepsilon)
	&=P(X_n\in K_\varepsilon,Y_n\in T_\varepsilon)\\
	&=P(X_n\in K_\varepsilon)P(Y_n\in T_\varepsilon)\\
	&\ge (1-\varepsilon)^2.
\end{align*}
 Let us define the function $\mathcal S:H\times H\to H$ by setting $\mathcal S(f,g)=f+g$ for each $(f,g)\in H\times H$. This function is continuous since
$$
	\|f+g-(h+k)\|_H\le\|f-h\|_H+\|g-k\|_H
$$
and
$$
	\|(f,g)-(h,k)\|_{H\times H}^2=\|f-h\|_H^2+\|g-k\|_H^2.
$$
Hence, the sequence $X_n+Y_n$ is tight using the fact that if the sequence $X_n$ is tight, then so is $f(X_n)$, where $f$ is a continuous function. Is this proof correct? Does this proof depend on the particular form of the inner product of the space $H\times H$? Is it possible to relax the assumption of independence?

1936985,On the definition of the holomorphic tangent space,"First of all I'll motivate my question: when we define the tangent space to a smooth manifold $M$ we can go through two different approaches that at the end give the same result. First approach We pick $U \subset X$ an open subset and $p \in U$. We define a derivation at $p$ as a $\mathbb{R}$ linear map $D: C^{\infty}_X(U) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that verifies Liebntiz's condition at $p$, i.e. $D(f \, g) = D(f) \, g(p) + f(p) \, D(g)$. We then define the tangent space in $p$ at $U$ as $T_{p, U} =  \{ D: C^{\infty}_X(U) \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \; \text{derivation at $p$}\}$. Using bump functions one can prove that the inclusion $i : U \hookrightarrow X$ induces an isomorphism between the tangent spaces at $p \in U$ and so the concept of tangent space turns out to be local. Second approach We do the same except that we define a derivation as a $\mathbb{R}$ linear map $D: C^{\infty}_{p,X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where with $C^{\infty}_{p,X}$ it's the stalk at $p$ of the sheaf $C^{\infty}_X$. In this way the tangent space is defined as a local concept. My question deal with the holomorphic tangent space. It is defined via derivation at a point $p$: $\mathbb{C}$ linear map $D: \mathcal{O}_{p,X} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$.
Is the reason for which it is defined this way that we don't have a holomorphic analogous of $C^{\infty}$ partitions of unity? I guess it is, but I would like a confirmation. If we had defined the holomorphic tangent space as we did in the first approach for the smooth tangent space, what would have been the problem? Would have we had some pathological situation?
