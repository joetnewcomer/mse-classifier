3133756,When does a sequence's snake-product converge?,"Following this earlier unanswered question, Does this infinite primes snake-product converge? ( MO version ),
I would like to pose a more general question.
Given any increasing sequence $s_i$ of natural numbers,
form the infinite snake-product by multiplying fractions $\frac{s_i}{s_{i+1}} \cdot \frac{s_{i+3}}{s_{i+2}}$ .
For example, if the sequence $s$ is just the natural numbers, $1,2,3, \ldots$ , the snake-product $\sigma( s )$ is: $$
\sigma = \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{4}{3}\cdot\frac{5}{6}\cdot\frac{8}{7}\cdot\frac{9}{10}\cdot\frac{12}{11} \cdot \cdots 
 \approx 0.59907 \;.
$$ The approximate product shown is what I computed up to $i=10^6$ .
A specific question: Q1 . Does the above product (for the sequence $s_i = i$ ) converge, and if so, to what number? Answered by @Peter: Yes, converges to $$
\frac{ \sqrt{2} \, \pi^{3/2} } { \Gamma( \frac{1}{4} )^2 } 
\approx 0.59907 \;.
$$ I would be interested to see other example sequences that appear to, or can be proved to, converge. One might distinguish between strictly increasing sequences and non-decreasing sequences. And the more general title question: Q2 . Under what conditions on the sequence $s_i$ will

3133952,Spivak Calculus on Manifolds - Tangent space on a boundary point of a manifold,"I am an undergraduate student who is studying Spivak's calculus on manifolds. I have several questions in the pages 119 and 120 of the book, which are about the tangent space at a boundary point of a manifold. Our definitions of vector fields, forms, and orientations can
be made for manifolds-with-boundary also. If $M$ is a $k$ -dimensional
manifold-with-boundary and $x\in\partial M$ , then $(\partial M)_x$ is
a $(k-1)$ -dimensional subspace of the $k$ -dimensional vector space $M_x$ . Thus there are exactly two unit vectors in $M_x$ which are
perpendicular to $(\partial M)_x$ ; they can be distinguished as follows
(Figure $5-8$ ). If $f:W\to\mathbf{R}^{n}$ is a coordinate system with $W\subset H^{k}$ and $f(0)=x$ , then only one of these unit vectors is $f_*(v_0)$ for some $v_0$ with $v^{k}<0$ . This unit vector is called
the outward unit normal $n(x)$ ; it is not hard to check that this
definition does not depend on the coordinate system $f$ .
Suppose that $\mu$ is an orientation of a $k$ -dimensional manifold-with-boundary $M$ . If $x\in\partial M$ , choose $v_1,\ldots,v_{k-1}\in(\partial M)_x$ so that $[n(x),v_1,\ldots,v_{k-1}]=\mu _x$ . If it is also true that $[n(x),w_1,\ldots,w_{k-1}]=\mu _x$ , then both $[v_1,\ldots,v_{k-1}]$ and $[w_1,\ldots,w_{k-1}]$ are the same orientation for $(\partial M)_x$ . This
orientation is denoted by $(\partial\mu)_x$ . It is easy to see that the orientations $(\partial\mu)_x$ ,for $x\in\partial M$ , are consistent on $\partial M$ . Thus if $M$ is orientable, $\partial M$ is also orientable, and an orientation $\mu$ for $M$ determines an orientation $\partial\mu$ for $\partial M$ , called the induced
orientation . If we apply these definitions to $\mathbf{H}^{k}$ with the usual
orientation, we find that the induced orientation on $\mathbf{R}^{k-1}=\left\{x\in\mathbf{H}^{k}:x^{k}=0\right\} $ is $(-1)^{k}$ times the usual orientation. The reason for such a choice will become
clear in the next section. I think I understand why there are exactly two unit vectors in $M_x$ which are perpendicular to $(\partial M)_x$ . This is because the dimension of the subspace of $M_x$ that is orthogonal to $(\partial M)_x$ is 1, and in a one dimensional space, there are two unit vectors which have the same size but the different directions (Is this correct?). And Spivak says in the picture that ""..., then only one of these unit vectors is $f_*(v_0)$ for some $v_0$ with $v^k < 0$ . Is it right that ""these unit vectors"" mean the two unit vectors perpendicular to $(\partial M)_x$ and that it is 'only one' because it cannot have two different directions at the same time? Spivak says it is easy to see that given an orientation of a k dimensional manifold with boundary $M$ , the orientations $(\partial \mu)_x$ for $x \in \partial M$ are consistent on $(\partial M)_x$ . My reasoning is that following the Spivak's definition of consistent choices of orientations, consider a chart $f: W \subset H^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and $a, b \in W$ ( $a$ is an interior point and $b$ is an interior point). Because by assumption $M$ is orientable, if $\mu_{f(a)} = [f_*((e_1)a), . . . , f_*((e_k)a)]$ , then $\mu_{f(b)} = [f_*((e_1)b), . . . , f_*((e_{k - 1})b), n(b)]$ where $n(b)$ is an outward unit normal. Then, we can choose $[f_*((e_1)b), . . . , f_*((e_{k - 1})b)]$ as $(\partial \mu)_b$ . In this way, by restricting $f$ to the intersection of its image and $\partial M$ , we can get the same orientation for all $x \in \partial M$ ; thus, if $M$ is orientable, so is $\partial M$ . Please check if my reasoning is okay. At the bottom of the picture, Spivak says the induced orientation on ... is $(-1)^k$ times the usual orientation. I really cannot understand how this happens. In the next page, he says that the vectors $n(x)$ vary continuously on $M$ . Also, conversely, if a continuous family of unit normal vectors $n(x)$ is defined on all of $M$ , we can determine an orientation of $M$ . Could you explain why this is the case?

3133963,Is the theory of the category of topological spaces computable?,"This question is inspired by this Mathoverflow question . Ignoring size issues, there is a natural way to view a category as a first-order structure in a finite language. In light of this we can ask about the computational complexity of the first-order theory of a given category. Note that a lot of important structure is lost when passing to the first-order level; nevertheless, it still seems interesting to me. Plenty of categories are easily checked to have very complicated first-order theories - for example, assuming the axiom of choice in the background we can identify the finite sets as those for which every self-injection is a surjection, and since Cartesian products and disjoint unions give the usual arithmetic we have that the first-order theory of the category Sets is not computable. Incidentally, choice isn't needed here, but the non-choice argument is a bit more tedious. My question is: Is the first-order theory of the category Top of topological spaces (with morphisms being continuous maps) computable? My suspicion is that the answer is no. An obvious way to prove this would be to show that the finite discrete spaces are first-order characterizable here, since then we could run the same argument as for Sets ; however, I don't see how to do this. (In particular, the notion of ""compact objcet"" of a category is not obviously first-order expressible, so that characterization of finite discrete spaces doesn't seem to help.) There are weaker versions of this question which could be asked: We could focus on the theory of the categorial equivalence class of Top - that is, the set of sentences true in every category which is categorially equivalent to Top . In general categorial equivalence does not imply elementary equivalence (since a two-element category can be categorially equivalent to a one-element category ), so this is a nontrivial weakening. We could also restrict attention to a subcollection of categories - that is, pin down some non-first-order categorial property $P$ of Top , and then ask for a first-order theory which distinguishes the theory of Top (or the theory of the categorial equivalence class of Top ) within this class . For example, Lawvere's ETCS characterizes Sets up to categorial equivalence amongst the locally small complete categories . I am also interested in comments along these lines; however, my main question is specifically about the first-order theory of Top . EDIT: David Roberts brought to my attention Schlomiuk's paper An elementary theory of the category of topological spaces ; among other things, this gives a computable (indeed, finite) theory characterizing Top up to categorial equivalence amongst complete categories, as well as in a more subtle sense (any such category is equivalent to Top $^\mathfrak{S}$ for some model $\mathfrak{S}$ of ETCS).","['general-topology', 'logic', 'category-theory', 'computability']"
3133981,Is it possible for $x$ to appear in the definition of $\delta$ in an $\epsilon-\delta$ proof of limit?,"Logic tells me it is not (it would be circular, since the allowed interval for $x$ is itself defined by $\delta$ ), but I don't know where is the error in my workings. I'll explain... My doubt arised when studying the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition for non-linear polynomial functions, say a quadratic function, when you want to prove that the limit equals the value of the function at any given value of $x$ . This could be the case when checking continuity, for example. As I've seen so far, the normal way of solving the proof for quadratic polynomials consists in converting the epsilon inequality like so: $$|f(x) - L| < \epsilon = -\epsilon < f(x) - L < \epsilon$$ Then equaling the middle part with de lower side of the $\delta$ inequality and finally choosing the minimum of the two possibilities you get, taken into account you have to assure all values of $x$ will have an image inside the $\epsilon$ interval. But! As I've recently realised, the polynomial you get after subtracting the limit to the function when both equal each other, as this nullifies to 0, is always factorable. Plus, one of the two factors you get already corresponds to the lower side of the delta inequality. Here is the formal proof of this. Given: $$\lim_{x \to n} ax^2 + bx + c = an^2 + bn + c$$ The epsilon inequality of the proof would be: $$|ax^2 + bx + c - (an^2 + bn + c)| < \epsilon$$ And working from that: $$|ax^2 + bx + c - an^2 - bn - c| < \epsilon$$ $$|ax^2 + bx - an^2 - bn| < \epsilon$$ $$|a(x^2 - n^2) + b(x - n)| < \epsilon$$ $$|a(x + n)(x - n) + b(x - n)| < \epsilon$$ $$|(x - n)(a(x + n) + b)| < \epsilon$$ $$|x - n||a(x + n) + b| < \epsilon$$ $$|x - n| < \frac{\epsilon}{|a(x + n) + b|}$$ And there it is! You'll always have the lower side of the delta inequality on the left. Thus, you could define $\delta$ as: $$\delta \le \frac{\epsilon}{|a(x + n) + b|}$$ Et voilà! Here you have $x$ defining delta. Now, obviously something weird is going on here... isn't it? I highly suspect my math is flawed at some point, possibly when handling absolute values. Add to that I have no idea how to connect this method with the one that has to choose between two possible values of $\delta$ . Any help with this mess would be much appreciated!","['limits', 'calculus', 'epsilon-delta']"

Discussion So my issue here is that I don't know how to use infinity in Lebesgue integration. It is intuitive (I think) that evaluation of the improper Riemann integrals \begin{align}
\int_1^\infty \left|f(x)\right| &= \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x} = \lim_{c \to \infty} \ln c = + \infty \\ \\
\int_1^\infty \left|f(x)\right|^2 &= \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} = 1 - \lim_{c \to \infty} \frac{1}{c} = 1
\end{align} would imply our proposition, but I've only seen $L^p$ -spaces defined in the sense of Lebesgue integrals. So when I get to these steps: \begin{align}
\int_{[1, \infty)} \left|f(x)\right| &= \int_{[1, \infty)} \frac{1}{x} = \cdots \\ \\
\int_{[1, \infty)} \left|f(x)\right|^2 &= \int_{[1, \infty)} \frac{1}{x^2} = \cdots
\end{align} I'm not sure how to proceed. I'm guessing we need an argument for switching between the two types of integration, which I've read up on a little bit, but am not sure how to apply here in the improper case.","['integration', 'improper-integrals', 'normed-spaces', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

\left(-a\right) + a = 0

b = 0 + b = \left(c + a\right) + b = c + \left(a + b\right) = c + 0 = c;

Diffeotopy group : The diffeotopy group D(M) of a smooth manifold M is the quotient of the diffeomorphism group Diff(M) by its normal subgroup Diff $_0$ (M) of diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity. Alternatively, one may think of the diffeotopy group as the group $π_0$ (Diff(M)) of path components of Diff(M), since any continuous path in Diff(M) can be approximated by a smooth one, i.e. an isotopy. Isometry group : the isometry group of a metric space is the set of all bijective isometries (i.e. bijective, distance-preserving maps) from the metric space onto itself, with the function composition as group operation. Its identity element is the identity function. These concepts are important and relevant for exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ , for example, we can ask: ""Does every isometry group of an exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ inject into its diffeotopy group ?"" So my question here is aimed for a relation and interpretations between the definitions of Diffeotopy group, Mapping Class group, Isometry group ? For example, it seems that $$
\text{MCG($S^2 \times S^1)= \mathbb Z_2 \oplus \mathbb Z_2$}
$$ $$
\text{extended-MCG($S^2 \times S^1)=\mathbb Z_2 \oplus \mathbb Z_2 \oplus \mathbb Z_2$}
$$ similarly, $$
\text{ diffeotopy group of $(S^2 \times S^1)=\mathbb Z_2 \oplus \mathbb Z_2 \oplus \mathbb Z_2$}
$$ Are there general relations between the above Diffeotopy group, Mapping Class group, Isometry group ?","['mapping-class-group', 'diffeomorphism', 'geometric-topology', 'general-topology', 'differential-topology']"

For $n = 1$ , a finite etale morphism of degree 1 must be an isomorphism $S \rightarrow S$ , so we are done.

Of course, if we don't require that the entire space has finite measure, then we can come up with examples like $f_n = \chi_{n,n+1}$ , but this sort of example doesn't work in a probability space, since of course the tails have to vanish, so in fact this sort of r.v. does in fact converge in probability to zero.

3134468,"Why is $e^{it}$ a submersion, and what is the relationship between the derivative $\dot h(t)$ and the differential $h_{*,t}$?","My book is An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring W. Tu. In the paragraph below, why exactly is $h: \mathbb R \to S^1, h(t)=(\cos t, \sin t) \cong e^{it}$ a submersion, and what is the relationship between the derivative $\dot h(t) = (-\sin t, \cos t) \cong ie^{it}$ and the differential $h_{*,t}$ ? My argument is that the image of the differential at any $t$ , $h_{*,t}: T_t(\mathbb R) \to T_{e^{it}}(S^1)$ , is a vector subspace of $S^1$ , which has dimension 1, so the image has dimension either $0$ or $1$ , so the differential is either trivial or surjective. I think I can show each $h_{*,t}$ is not trivial directly by computing the image: $$im(h_{*,t}) = h_{*,t}(T_t(\mathbb R)) = \{h_{*,t}(a \frac{d}{dt})\}_{a \in \mathbb R} = \{ah_{*,t}(\frac{d}{dt})\}_{a \in \mathbb R}$$ $$\ne \{\text{the zero element of} \ T_{e^{it}}(S^1) \ \text{which I think corresponds to the point} \ 1+0i \in S^1 \}$$ I cannot seem to identify the precise relationship between the derivative $\dot h(t)$ and the differential $h_{*,t}$ , which I think I would assume in proving the preceding inequality. For a function $f: M \to \mathbb R$ , there is a relationship between $f$ 's a submersion at $p$ and $f$ 's partial derivatives, but now we have $f: \mathbb R \to M$ . Update : My answer considers the inclusion $g = \iota \circ h$ of $h$ into $\mathbb R^2$ . After all, we have in the first place that $h$ is smooth by Theorem 11.15 because $g$ is smooth. For such inclusion $g = \iota \circ h: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R^2$ , $g(t_0) = (\iota \circ h)(t_0) = \iota(h(t_0))=h(t_0), \iota: S^1 \to \mathbb R^2$ , we have by chain rule that for each $t_0 \in \mathbb R$ , $g_{*,t_0}: T_{t_0}\mathbb R \to T_{h(t_0)}\mathbb R^2$ is given by $g_{*,t_0} = \iota_{*,h(t_0)} \circ h_{*,t_0}$ . For each $t_0 \in \mathbb R$ , $\iota_{*,h(t_0)}: T_{h(t_0)}S^1 \to T_{h(t_0)}\mathbb R^2$ is still inclusion so $\iota_{*,h(t_0)} \circ h_{*,t_0} = h_{*,t_0}$ Let $t_0 \in \mathbb R$ . If $h_{*,t_0}$ is not the zero map, then $h_{*,t_0}$ is surjective because the image of $h_{*,t_0}: T_{t_0}\mathbb R \to T_{h(t_0)}S^1$ is a subspace of $T_{h(t_0)}S^1 \cong \mathbb R$ and thus is (isomorphic to) either $\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb R^0 = \{0\}$ . Now, I'll argue that $h_{*,t_0}$ is not the zero map if I can show that $g_{*,t_0}$ is not the zero map since $T_{h(t_0)}S^1$ and $T_{h(t_0)}\mathbb R^2$ share the same zero element since $T_{h(t_0)}S^1$ is a vector subspace of $T_{h(t_0)}\mathbb R^2$ . $g_{*,t_0}$ is not the zero map if the geometric derivative (or velocity vector) $g'(t_0) := g_{*,t_0}[\frac{d}{dt}|_{t_0}]$ is not the zero vector i.e. if $g_{*,t_0}$ maps the basis element of $T_{t_0}\mathbb R$ to a nonzero element of $T_{h(t_0)}\mathbb R^2$ . Finally, $g'(t_0)$ , by Proposition 8.15 , is represented by calculus derivative $\dot g(t) = (-\sin(t),\cos(t))$ through $g'(t_0) = -\sin(t)\frac{\partial}{\partial r^1} + \cos(t) \frac{\partial}{\partial r^2}$ , where $r^1$ and $r^2$ are the standard coordinates on $\mathbb R^2$ such that $\{\frac{\partial}{\partial r^1}, \frac{\partial}{\partial r^2} \}$ forms a basis for $T_{h(t_0)}\mathbb R^2$ . By (6), $g'(t_0)$ is not the zero vector of $T_{h(t_0)}\mathbb R^2$ . Therefore, by (7),(5),(4) $g_{*,t_0}$ is the not the zero map. Therefore, by (3) and (8), neither is $h_{*,t_0}$ i.e. $h'(t_0)$ is the not the zero vector of $T_{h(t_0)}S^1$ .","['proof-verification', 'general-topology', 'derivatives', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"

At a point $(a,b)$ , we have $f(a,b) = 0 \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ . Then in a neighborhood $U \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ around $a$ , we have a $C^1$ function $g: \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ such that $f(x,g(x))=0$ and $g(a) = b$ in this neighborhood. The above equation of derivatives holds in this neighborhood as well. I tried to replicate the equation above by applying the chain rule straightforwardly to $f(x,g(x))$ . Considering the total derivative of a single component $f_i$ of $f$ with respect to $x_j$ in $U$ , we should have: $$\nabla_{x_j} f_i = \sum_{t=1}^{m}\dfrac{\partial f_t}{\partial g_t}(x,g(x))\dfrac{\partial g_t}{\partial x_j}(x) + \dfrac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}(x,g(x))$$ This is simply the sum of all $f_i$ 's components' derivatives with respect to $x_j$ .

3134831,Unexpected proof that $\alpha!$ divides $k!$ if $\alpha_1 + \dots + \alpha_n = k$.,"Let $\alpha = (\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_n) \in \mathbb{N}_0^n$ be a multiindex with $\alpha_1  + \dots + \alpha_n = k$ . Let $\alpha! = \alpha_1! \dots \alpha_n!$ with the convention that $0! = 1$ . I think I proved the following claim in a somewhat unexpected way, and would like some feedback if it is correct. Claim $\alpha!$ divides $k!$ Proof: We define an action of the symmetric group $S_k$ on the set $M := \{1,\dots,k\}^k$ by $\sigma (n_1,\dots,n_k) := (n_{\sigma(1)},\dots,n_{\sigma(k)})$ . Now consider the element $x = (1, \dots, 1, 2, \dots 2, \dots, n)\in M$ , where each number $i$ appears $\alpha_i$ times. This is in $M$ exactly because of the hypothesis $\alpha_1 + \dots + \alpha_n = k$ . Now the stabilizer subgroup $H$ of $x$ in $S_k$ is the group which acts independently on the blocks of size $\alpha_i$ . But this is isomorphic to $\prod_i S_{\alpha_i}$ , which has order $\alpha!$ . Because the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group we have $\alpha! = \#H \mid \#(S_k) = k!$ . What I like about this is that it is free of any calculations, which would be my first approach to prove this claim.","['symmetric-groups', 'proof-verification', 'combinatorics', 'multinomial-coefficients']"
3134844,Constructing a probability measure on the Hypercube with given moments,"Let $H = [-1, 1]^d$ be the $d$ -dimensional hypercube, and let $\mu \in \text{int} H$ . Under these conditions, I can explicitly construct a tractable probability measure $P$ , supported on on $H$ , which has $\mu$ as its mean. For my purposes, tractability means: (a) $P$ has a density, which can be written down and cheaply evaluated. (b) $P$ can be exactly sampled from, efficiently. This is a relatively simple task, since the problem basically decouples across dimensions; if you can find a probability measure $P_i$ on $[-1,1]$ with mean $\mu_i$ , then setting $P = P_1 (x_1) \cdots P_d (x_d)$ suffices. I've been using the family of random variables given by $P(x) \propto \exp( \langle \theta, x \rangle)$ to do this; the mean of each coordinate is then given by $m_i(\theta) = \coth \theta_i - \theta_i^{-1}$ which is surjective onto $(-1,1)$ and so one can always find a $\theta$ which gives you the mean you want. Now, suppose I want to extend this, and construct a probability measure on $H$ which also has the covariance matrix I want, i.e. let $\Sigma$ be a general $d \times d$ positive semi-definite matrix. Then, I want all the above, plus: \begin{align}
\textbf{Var}_{X \sim P} [X] &= \Sigma
\end{align} This is more or less possible when $\Sigma$ is diagonal, but otherwise I haven't figured out how to do it. Of course, in the general case, I will need $\Sigma$ to be sufficiently small, as I can't have arbitrarily high variance when constrained to a cube, I've considered sampling from a truncated Gaussian, i.e. sampling from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ until you land in $H$ . However, this won't generally have a tractable density, due to the normalising constant. It also won't quite have the right moments, though I can basically forgive this; I ultimately don't mind too much if I only have \begin{align}
\mathbf{E}_{X \sim P} [X] &\approx \mu \\
\textbf{Var}_{X \sim P} [X] &\approx \Sigma
\end{align} with some control of the bias. I should perhaps highlight that it's not sufficient for my purposes to approximate $\Sigma$ by a diagonal matrix. So, the concise version of my question is: is there a way of explicitly constructing probability measures on the hypercube which have the mean and covariance matrix which I want it to have? There needn't be a 'canonical' / optimal' answer (whatever that might mean here); something functional will entirely suffice. It's also preferable to have a construction where it's easy to adapt things to sample from a range of different $(\mu, \Sigma)$ .","['covariance', 'probability-distributions', 'moment-problem', 'sampling', 'probability']"

3134938,Why is the algebraic torus an affine variety?,"I am reading Toric Varieties by Cox, Little, and Schenck. I am stuck on the definition an algebraic torus, given in Part 1.1, page 10, which states: The affine variety $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ is a group under componentwise multiplication. A torus $T$ is an affine variety isomorphic to $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ , where $T$ inherits a group structure from the isomorphism. Now, my understanding of the definition of an affine variety, as per Hartshorne is a subset $A$ of affine $n$ -space over an algebraically closed field $k$ , such that $A = Z(B)$ , i.e. $A$ is the zero-locus of some set $B\subset k[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ . My question is, why is it stated that $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ is an affine variety? What set of polynomials is it the zero-locus of? In particular, if $n=1$ , then the only algebraic sets are finite sets, so how can $\mathbb{C}^* = \mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\}$ be an algebraic set if it is infinite? Now, I suspect that affine variety should maybe be just variety as per Hartshorne's definition in Hartshorne page 15 where he defined a variety to be any affine, quasi-affine, projective, or quasi-projective variety. And thus together with morphisms between varieties we have the category of varieties. Also I talked to some other people who know more about algebraic geometry who seems to not understand why there is confusion, since apparently they have a more general and abstract definition of a variety than merely as zero-loci. Whereas I understand that maybe after I've read enough of Hartshorne I may resolve this issue, the prerequisites listed for this particular chapter of Toric Varieties , which is also another book by Cox, called Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms also only uses this ""elementary"" definition. Therefore I expect this question to be resolvable within the bounds of my current progress of Hartshorne.

The question is to show $$\sum_{k=1}^{n}\binom{2n+1}{2k}B_{2k}= \frac{2n-1}{2}\tag{1}$$ I am stuck on showing this, but have some initial leads (from earlier in the problem). We have $B_0=f(0)=1$ , and from Palka's hint, $z \mapsto z/2+f(z)$ is even: $$\begin{split}
\frac{z}{2}+f(z)=& \frac{z(e^z-1)+2z}{2(e^z-1)}= \frac{ze^z+z}{2(e^z-1)}\\

3135684,"Why is using the arc length of a circle, $s$, equivalent to using the angle measure in radians, $\theta$, as the input of the trigonometric functions?","Upon introducing the idea of circular functions my textbook states: We start at the point $(1,0)$ and measure an arc length $s$ along the circle. [...] Let the endpoint of this arc be at the point $(x, y)$ . The circle is the unit circle - it has center at the origin and radius 1 unit (hence the name unit circle ). Recall from algebra that the equation of this circle is: $x^2 + y^2 =1$ The radian measure of $\theta$ is related to the arc length $s$ . For $\theta$ measured in radians, we know that $s=r\theta$ . Here $r=1$ , so $s$ , which is measured in linear units such as inches or centimeters, is equal to $\theta$ , measured in radians. Thus, the trigonometric functions of angle $\theta$ in radians found by choosing a point $(x, y)$ on the unit circle can be rewritten as functions of the arc length $s$ , a real number. When interpreted this way, they are called circular functions. I have several questions regarding this: 1) The text points out that the arc length, $s$ is measured in linear units while the angle measure, $\theta$ , is in radians. Clearly two different units of measurement, so how could the two unit types be used interchangeably as the inputs of the trigonometric functions, where, for example, $\sin(s)= \sin(\theta)$ ? 2) $s=\theta$ is derived from $s=r\theta$ (formula for calculating arc length) and the fact that a unit circle has a radius of $1$ , $r=1$ . However, if the unit circle is not used and the radius is no longer 1, then is the arc length, $s$ , still equal to the angle measure $\theta$ ? How? 3) Why not continue using angle measure in radians as the input for the trig. functions? Why use arc length instead?","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"
3135697,Is the set of paths between any two points moving only in units on the plane countable or uncountable?,"Consider 2 arbitrary, fixed points A and B on the plane. Suppose you can move from point A in unit distance at any angle to another point and from this point you can again travel a unit distance at any angle to another point and so on.  Ultimately your goal is to travel from point A to point B along a path of unit-distance line segments without repeating a point during your journey. Is the set of such paths countable or uncountable? I believe it is uncountable and here is my thought process, but I'm not sure of my logic.  Consider the line between the two points equidistant from them; call this line L.  A path of only unit distances can be made between A and any point, P, which lies on L without crossing L(I don't know how to prove this statement but it seems true).  This path can be mirrored on the other side of L to connect B to P.  Thus for any point, P, which lies on L a path can be made from A to B crossing through P halfway through the path.  Since the points on L are uncountable the set of paths between A and B are also uncountable.","['elementary-set-theory', 'geometry']"

Say $X = \text{spec}B$ , $Y = \text{spec}A$ , and $Z = \text{spec}C$ , with $C \simeq B / I$ for some ideal $I$ of $B$ . Then the conormal exact sequence of modules reads, $$

3135884,Proving (without AC) that there is a surjective function from $\mathcal{P}(\omega)$ to $\omega_1$.,"Problem I am working on the following exercise from page 60 of Kunen's Foundations of Mathematics : Prove, without using AC, that one can map $\mathcal{P}(\omega)$ onto $\omega_1$ . In my copy of the text, he provides the following hint: Define $f:\mathcal{P}(\omega\times\omega)\xrightarrow{\text{onto}}\omega_1$ so that $f(R)=\text{type}(R)$ whenever $R$ is a well-order of $\omega$ and $f(R)=|R|$ whenever $R$ is finite. My instructor added to this hint, by saying that $f(R)=0$ (or any other number of your choice) otherwise. Attempt at Solution Ok, so I need to establish that there is a surjective function from $\mathcal{P}(\omega)$ to $\omega_1$ , and the function Kunen provided as a hint is going to help me do this.  With the help of my instructor, I made a rough roadmap for this proof: Ensure $f$ is a well-defined function that does not require the Axiom of Choice. $\checkmark$ Show that $f$ (as given above) is surjective. Establish the fact that $\mathcal{P}(\omega\times\omega)\approx \mathcal{P}(\omega)$ , i.e. there is a bijection $g:\mathcal{P}(\omega)\rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\omega\times\omega)$ . $\checkmark$ Conclude desired result by taking the composition $g\circ f$ , i.e. $g\circ f=h:\mathcal{P}(\omega)\rightarrow \omega_1$ . $\checkmark$ As indicated by the $\checkmark$ 's, I understand all of the steps required of this proof other than showing that $f$ is surjective. I know that $\omega_1$ is the (first) uncountable ordinal containing all countable ordinals.  So to show surjectivity, I need to show that for any ordinal $\alpha\in\omega_1$ we have some $R\in\mathcal{P}(\omega\times\omega)$ such that $f(R)=\alpha$ . My first thought was to think of $\omega_1$ as containing two different types of countable ordinals: countable and finite, and countable and infinite. So if $R$ is a well-order of $\omega$ , then $f(R)=\text{type}(R)=\text{type}(\omega;R)=\alpha$ ,  where $\alpha$ is the unique ordinal such that $(\omega;R)\simeq(\alpha;\in)$ .  I don't think I understand order type very well, but in my head this means that all ordinals $\alpha\geq \omega$ will get ""hit"".  Then the rest of the ordinals $<\omega$ will get hit via $f(R)=|R|$ (or $0$ ?). But this feels wrong... Question Clearly I am struggling with showing this function is surjetive, if the absolute mess of thoughts above wasn't indication enough.  I am wondering if you kind souls would be willing to help me fill in the gaps in my understanding (as it pertains to showing $f$ is surjective), so that I may finally be able to complete this proof.

To do this, I used the singular value decomposition. However, I was wondering if there's a different proof that relies on more general properties of Hilbert spaces (under the assumption that $u$ exists in the more general setting where $\langle \cdot, \cdot\rangle$ and $\|\cdot\|$ are the Hilbert space inner product and norm). My own short proof is below: We first handle the case where $A = \operatorname{diag}(d_1, \ldots, d_n)$ for some $d_1\geq \cdots\geq d_n\geq 0$ . Then, $u = e_1$ , so $$\lvert \langle u, v\rangle\rvert^2\|A\|^2 = d_1^2v_1^2\leq \sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2v_i^2 = \|Av\|^2$$ Now, we consider general $A$ , which has a singular value decomposition $A = U\Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}$ for $U$ and $V$ orthogonal and $\Sigma$ diagonal in the above form. First, we recall that multiplication by orthogonal matrices preserves the dot product, i.e. $\langle Qx, Qy\rangle = \langle x, y\rangle$ for orthogonal $Q$ . This allows us to write $$\|Av\|^2 = \langle U\Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}v, U\Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}v\rangle = \langle \Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}v, \Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}v\rangle = \|\Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}v\|^2$$ for arbitrary $v\in \mathbb{R}$ . Furthermore, as $\|Au\|^2 = \|\Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}u\|^2$ and $\|V^{\mathrm{T}}u\|^2 = \|u\|^2 = 1$ , we have that $\|A\| = \|\Sigma\|$ and that $y = V^{\mathrm{T}}u$ satisfies $\|\Sigma y\| = \|\Sigma\|$ . Combining our earlier results, $$\|Av\|^2 = \|\Sigma V^{\mathrm{T}}v\|^2\geq \lvert\langle y, V^{\mathrm{T}}v\rangle\rvert^2\|\Sigma\|^2 = \lvert\langle V^{\mathrm{T}}u, V^{\mathrm{T}}v\rangle\rvert^2\|A\|^2 = \lvert\langle u, v\rangle\rvert^2\|A\|^2$$","['hilbert-spaces', 'linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis']"

Then $C$ is closed if and only if $C$ is weakly closed."" Proof: Suppose that $C$ is weakly closed. Then $C^c$ , the complement of $C$ is weakly open and hence open . Hence $C$ is closed. my problem is in the 2nd line of the proof written in bold line. How weakly open imply open? Thanks.","['functional-analysis', 'analysis']"
3136033,Pulling back $\mathfrak g $-valued 1-forms,"Let $\omega$ be a vector-valued 1-form where the vector space is the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and let $\mathcal P$ be a trivial principal bundle over a manifold $M$ . Thus $$
\omega\in\Omega^1(\mathcal P,\mathfrak g)=\Gamma((\mathcal P \times \mathfrak g)\otimes T^*\mathcal P).\tag1 
$$ I am reading that pulling back $\omega$ via the trivializing section $\sigma:M\to\mathcal P$ gives me a pull-back section $\sigma^*\omega\in\Omega^1(M,\mathfrak g)=\Gamma((M\times\mathfrak g)\otimes T^*M)$ . Namely, $\sigma^*\omega$ is a smooth section of the bundle $(M\times\mathfrak g)\otimes T^*M$ . Since a pull-back section is a section in the pull-back bundle, namely $$
\sigma^*\omega\in\Gamma(\sigma^*((\mathcal P\times\mathfrak g)\otimes T^*\mathcal P)),\tag2
$$ if what I am reading is correct, it follows that $$
\sigma^*((\mathcal P\times\mathfrak g)\otimes T^*\mathcal P)\cong(M\times\mathfrak g)\otimes T^*M.
$$ Moreover, given a fiber bundle $\pi:E\to M$ and a function $f:M'\to M$ , then the pull-back bundle $f^*E$ and the bundle $E$ share same fibers over points $x'\in M'$ and $x=f(x')\in M$ , since it is a special case of a product bundle. Then it follows that $(\mathcal P\times\mathfrak g)\otimes T^*\mathcal P$ must share same fibers with $(M\times\mathfrak g)\otimes T^*M$ $\textbf {Problem}$ : same fibers means $\mathfrak g\otimes T^*P\cong\mathfrak g\otimes T^*M$ , which is of course not true. So what's wrong?","['fiber-bundles', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"
3136052,Circle problem in which i wanted to find value of $PQ$,"Find a value of $PQ$ : Let the radius of bigger circle be $R$ , and that of the smaller circles be $r_1$ and $r_2$ . Hence we can find value of $R = 10$ .
I don't know how to proceed further to find the Value of $r_1$ and $r_2$ .","['euclidean-geometry', 'geometric-transformation', 'circles', 'geometry']"
3136105,A linear space of degenerate matrices.,"Denote by $M_n(\mathbb{R})$ the set of all $n$ by $n$ real matrices. It's a linear space over $\mathbb{R}$ . Can we find a nontrivial vector subspace in which all the matrices are degenerate? If possible, what is the maximum possible dimension of this subspace? I thought about the set of upper triangular matrices, where all the the numbers at a certain position on the diagonal line of all matrices are always zero. This meets the requirements, but I don't how to deal with the 'maximum' problem. Any hints? Thank you in advance.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'vector-spaces']"
