497708,Is a continuous function with continuous weak derivatives of class $C^1$?,Let $f$ be a real valued continuous function of many variables whose weak derivatives of first order are continuous. Is this function equals a.e. function of class $C^1$ ?,"['weak-derivatives', 'analysis']"
497720,Why do you need to introduce complex numbers in order to solve cubics by radicals?,"Historically, complex numbers were first introduced (by Bombelli) in order to provide a method for solving the cubic by radicals.  As far as I can tell, previous solutions of the cubic by radicals didn't use complex numbers, but instead used some incredibly complicated reasoning that is basically equivalent to introducing complex numbers. Later on, it turned out that cubics over the complex numbers had particularly nice properties; in particular, they always had three roots in the complex plane (up to multiplicity). But the original guys weren't interested in cubics over the complex plane.  They wanted to find real roots of cubics with real coefficients, and intermediate complex numbers turned out to be a way to do that.  Indeed, the cubic formula uses complex numbers like $-\frac12+\frac{\sqrt3}2i$, but it still gives you three real numbers if you substitute in the coefficients of a real cubic with three real roots. So my question is: why is this necessary?  To be more specific: Let $K\subset\mathbb R$ be a field, and let $P$ be a polynomial in $K[X]$.  Do there exist fields $K=K_1\subset\dots\subset K_n\subset\mathbb R$, real numbers $\beta_i$ and natural numbers $m_i$ such that $\beta_i^{m_i}\in K_i$, $K_{i+1}=K_i(\beta_i)$ for each $i$, and all real roots of $P$ are contained in $K_n$? [Note that the extensions $K_{i+1}/K_i$ are not necessarily Galois extensions (indeed, they are not Galois extensions if they have degree greater than $2$).] If $P$ is a quadratic rather than a cubic, then the answer is 'yes'.  I imagine that the answer for a cubic or quartic is probably 'no' (and it is definitely 'no' for polynomials of higher degree).  But why? Before anyone says it: yes, I know you can solve cubics over the real numbers by using trigonometric or hyperbolic substitutions.  I'm only interested in solution by radicals.","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

497782,In how few points can a continuous curve meet all lines?,"Inspired by this (currently closed) question, I'm wondering about a related topic: given that we have a continuous parametric curve (that is, a curve of the form $(x=x(t), y=y(t))$ for $t\in\mathbb{R}$ and $x(t), y(t)$ continuous functions) which meets every line in the plane, what is the minimum number of times it must meet some line?  If the curve is (twice?) differentiable then the answer is 'three' by perturbation arguments (consider lines on either side of a tangent point), but those arguments (or at least the ones that I've been able to put together) make more-or-less explicit use of the curve's smoothness.  I suspect that some variant of the Jordan Curve Theorem might be used to show that the answer isn't even, but without the differentiability hypothesis I'm not even sure that the answer can't just be 'one' ( EDIT: of course it can't be a maximum of one intersection per line, as Karolis Juodelė points out below: just choose a line that goes between some two points on the curve! This also obviates the question I had about point sets, so I've removed that outright).  Can the perturbation argument be adapted to show that the minimum is three even for non-smooth curves, or is there some 'exotic' curve that meets each line no more than twice?","['geometry', 'plane-curves']"

497949,Confused about the explicit formula for $\psi_0(x)$,"In the explicit formula for $\psi_0(x)$ used in the PNT proof :
$$\psi_0(x) = x - \sum_{\rho} \frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho} - \frac{\zeta'(0)}{\zeta(0)} - \frac{1}{2} \log (1-x^{-2})  $$ In particular the part $$f(x)=\sum_{\rho} \frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho}$$ , I am confused about some things. I thought about truncated sums and conditional sums but I was still confused. My problems are these : 1) it seems $f(x)$ converges using the formula here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann%E2%80%93von_Mangoldt_formula although it is not trivial (to show) imho. However on the wiki page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_formulae_(L-function) the error term is given as Here the sum over zeroes should again be taken in increasing order of imaginary part $\sum_\rho\dfrac{x^\rho}{\rho} = \lim_{T \rightarrow \infty} S(x,T) \ $ where $S(x,T) = \sum_{\rho:|\Im \rho| \le T} \dfrac{x^\rho}{\rho} \ .$ The error involved in truncating the sum to $S(x,T)$ is of order $ x^2 \dfrac{\log^2 T}{T} + \log x.$ But this formula seems to large ? For small $T$ we get about $x^2$ ?
That does not make sense does it ? 2) It seems the function is differentiable ???
In the error formula above we see that if $T$ gets large we still have an error of about $C log(x)$. SO (?) the formula is considered as an asymtotic with error of log type and the differentiable function is then just the approximation to the true nondifferentiable function ? 3) Although the function is differentiable apparantly , I again wonder if the first derivative actually converges ?? 4) If the RH is true then $$\psi_0(x) = x + O(ln(x)^2 \sqrt x)$$ But I do not see how that follows from the above. In particular the formula for the error involving $T$ does not seem to fit ?? 5) Analogue (generalized) question to 1) 2) 3) ; how about twice differentiable ? And does the second derivative converge ? How about the $n$-th derivative ? 6) $\psi_0(x)$ should be discontinu at $x$ if $x$ is a prime. I do not see that from the formula , I assume it relates to the previous questions about differentiability and the error term. In fact I think this question is answered if the previous ones are. 7) Does this formula not give the possibility to prove the second hardy-littlewood conjecture when assuming RH and Cramer's prime gap conjecture ?","['improper-integrals', 'number-theory', 'error-propagation', 'prime-numbers', 'complex-analysis']"

497967,Confirming an error in a textbook: O'Neill's Semi-Riemannian Geometry,"I'm working on the following exercise in O'Neill's ""Semi-Riemannian Geometry"": (Page 53, 12) Let $b$ be a symmetric bilinear form on $V$. The nullspace of $b$ is $N = \{v : b(v,w) = 0, \, \forall w \in V\}$. The nullcone of $b$ is the set $\Lambda$ of all null vectors in $V$. Let $A = \Lambda \cup 0$, so $A \supset N$. Prove: (a) $N$ is a subspace, but $A$ is not unless $A=0$ or $V$. (b) $b$ is non-degenerate iff $N=0$; $b$ is definite iff $A=0$. (c) $b$ is semidefinite iff $N=A$. I think two of the claims here are false. $A$ is not a subspace unless it is $0$ or $V$. Counterexample:  Take $V = \mathbb{R}^2$, and let $b(e_1,e_1) = b(e_2,e_2) = 1$ but $b(e_1,e_2) = -1$. Then if we write $v = (x,y)$, the condition $b(v,v) = 0$ corresponds to the equation $$0 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = (x-y)^2$$ whose solution space is the diagonal subspace spanned by $(1,1)$, which is a subspace equal to neither $0$ nor $V$. $N=A$ implies $b$ semidefinite. Counterexample: Take $V = \mathbb{R}^2$, $b(e_1,e_1) = -1$, $b(e_2,e_2) = b(e_1,e_2) = 0$. Then if $v = (x,y)$, we have $b(v,v) = -x^2$, so $A$ is the set of vectors with zero in the first coordinate. However, if $v$ has zero in its first coordinate, then it is in $N$, so $A=N$.

498108,"dropping a particle into a vector field, part 2","Okay, so earlier I posted this question "" dropping a particle into a vector field "" as sort of a feeler question as i study line integrals in order to go into surface integrals and eventually differential forms and differential geometry and I got to thinking about my question's example and how to solve it.  I've taken an advanced linear algebra course and the required ODE course, but the ODE course never made it to solving systems of differential equations.  So my posited vector field in which I'm dropping a particle into is
$$\mathbf{F}(x,y)=y\mathbf{i}-x\mathbf{j}$$
An answer came in the form that in order to solve the question I posited, I needed to find an $\mathbf{r}$ such that $\mathbf{r}'(t)=\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t))$.  So my arbitrary $\mathbf{r}(t)=(\mathbf{x}(t),\mathbf{y}(t))$, if i take the derivative of this since it's just a vector valued function i get
$$\mathbf{r}'(t)=(\mathbf{x}'(t),\mathbf{y}'(t))$$
Now, 
$$\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t))=\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}(t),\mathbf{y}(t))=\mathbf{y}(t)\mathbf{i}-\mathbf{x}(t)\mathbf{j}=(\mathbf{y}(t),-\mathbf{x}(t))$$
So my equation has become
$$\mathbf{r}'(t)=(\mathbf{x}'(t),\mathbf{y}'(t))=(\mathbf{y}(t),-\mathbf{x}(t))$$
This gives me a system of differential equations to solve:
$$\mathbf{x}'(t)=\mathbf{y}(t)$$
$$\mathbf{y}'(t)=-\mathbf{x}(t)$$

This appears as a remark in Raymond Ryan's ""Introduction to Tensor Products of Banach Spaces"". (1) For all $\epsilon > 0$, $X$ is an $\mathcal{L}_{1,1+\epsilon}$ space. (2) For all $\epsilon > 0$, and for all finite-dimensional subspaces $M\subset X$, there exists a finite-dimensional subspace $N\subset X$ containing $M$ and an isomorphism $T\in B(N,\ell_{1}^{k})$ (where $k=\text{dim}(N)$) such that for all $x\in N$, $\left|\|Tx\| - \|x\|\right| \leq \epsilon\|x\|$. After unwinding all the quantifiers, the $(2)\Rightarrow (1)$ direction was straightforward. $\bf{\text{Sketch:}}$ Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given, and $M$ be a finite-dimensional subspace of $X$.  Then choose $\delta > 0$ so that $\frac{2\delta}{1 + \delta} < \epsilon$.

Using the triangle inequality and the given condition on $T$, it follows that $\|T\|\leq 1 + \delta$ and $\|T^{-1}\|\leq \frac{1}{1-\delta}$.  Therefore $\|T\|\cdot \|T^{-1}\|\leq 1 + \epsilon$, by the way $\delta$ was chosen. $\bf{\text{My Problem:}}$ But the $(1)\Rightarrow (2)$ direction has me totally stumped.

(This is useful for distributing points on $S^3$, the hypersphere in 4D, because the Jacobian of the transformation from uniform rectilinear coordinates to spherical coordinates creates a term containing $\sin^{2}x$.)

Two comments: for $f = 2$ and $g = x+1$ , we have $f\nmid g$ , but $f(x) \mid g(x)$ for infinitely many $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ . For that reason, I've added the requirement ""primitive"".

If we replace divisibility by equality, $f(x) = g(x)$ for sufficiently many $x\in\mathbb Z$ implies $f = g$ . Namely, it suffices to have $f(x) = g(x)$ for at least $\max(\operatorname{deg}(f),\operatorname{deg}(g))$ values $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ .
However, for $f = x$ and $g$ a polynomial with constant coefficient $a\neq 0$ , we have that $f(d) \mid g(d)$ for all divisors of $a$ , but $f\nmid g$ (see the comment of André Nicolas).

I want to change the mean of the weights to some new mean, also in the $[0,1]$ range, by modifying all the weights slightly (that is, I can't add or remove weights; only modify their values). Also, ideally, after changing the mean to a new value, if I do the algorithm again, and try to return to the original mean, I'll get the same original weights.  That is, the mapping function can work as its own inverse.  Which I think implies certain things about the distribution of the values of the weights before and after the mapping, but I'm not sure how to describe it in mathematical terms. Last, the amount of movement of individual weights should be minimized, probably in a least squares sort of way.  That is, I'd prefer to move all the values a slight amount over moving a single value from 0 to 1, for instance. Does anyone know how I might go about this sort of remapping?  Basically I have four requirements: After modifying the original weights, the new values stay within $[0,1]$.

The background is that I am teaching engineers the method of solving these equations but like everything else I like to give them a reason why the method works. I can explain why we might look for solutions of the form $e^{rx}$, why something like $Ae^{rx}$ will be a solution and why if $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions then so is $y_1+y_2$. I can explain the non-homogeneous case and why occasionally we have to look at test solutions of the form $xy_H$ --- where $y_H$ is a solution of the homogeneous equation. The problem occurs when I try and explain to them why the solutions have to be two dimensional and that we don't need three linearly independent solutions (in the homogeneous case). My best hand-waving argument thus far is that in a solution we will have to integrate twice somewhere and so we will end up with two constants of integration say $C_1$ and $C_2$ so our solution will be
$$y_H=y(x,C_1,C_2)$$

$dX_t = (b(t,X_t)+c(t,X_t)) dt + d\bar{W}_t$ Again I assume that 
$Z_t= \exp(-\int_{0}^{t} c(s,X_s) dW_s - 1/2 \int_{0}^{t} c(s,X_s)^2 ds)$ is a $P$-Martingale. Now my questions: Am I allowed to do this? If yes: Under which conditions is the last $Z_t$ a Martingale?
(Someone told me, that he thinks if $c(t,x)=c(x) \leq C (1+|x|)$ then $Z_t$ is a Martingale, is this correct? (why?)  Can I also use this Novikov condition here?) Do you have a reference where to find more information about this non-typical drift change by Girsanov?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'stochastic-analysis', 'stochastic-calculus']"
499019,Schwartz kernel theorem in the case the distributions are induced by smooth functions..,"how can I show that if $A:C^\infty(\mathbb T^n)\rightarrow C^\infty(\mathbb T^n)$ is a continuous linear operators then there is a unique linear and continuous operator $K_A: C^\infty(\mathbb T^n\times \mathbb T^n)\rightarrow \mathbb C$ such that, $$\langle A\varphi, \psi\rangle=\langle K_A, \psi\otimes \varphi\rangle.$$ Remember that if $u\in C^\infty(\mathbb T^n)$ then $u$ induces a distribution by the pairing: $$\langle u, \phi\rangle=\int_{\mathbb T^n} u(x)\phi(x)\ dx.$$ Indeed, I don't know if this result holds, that would be a version of the Schwartz kernel theorem in the case the distributions are induced by smooth functions... Can anyone help me...","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'distribution-theory', 'analysis']"
499023,Question on normal subgroup,"Let $x=(1 \, 2 \, 3 \, 4)$ and $y= (2 \, 4)$ be elements of $S_4$. Let $G= \langle x,y\rangle_{S_4}$, Let $H =\langle y\rangle_{S_4}$ and let $K=\langle x\rangle_{S_4}$. 
I have never seen this notation before, so I am confused on how to understand the elements in $G$, $H$, and $K$. I also need to figure out whether $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Which I know means that $Hg=gH$. Then if that is true, what elements would be in $G/H$? If not, then the equivalence class of $H$ is not congruent relation for the group operation of $G$..just now just how to show this.","['discrete-mathematics', 'abstract-algebra']"
499032,Calculations for a random variable given density function,"Studying for a statistics course an stumped on how to go bout solving a problem. The following is a problem I have solved - the problem I'm having trouble with is related to this one: Impurities in the batch of final product of a chemical process often reflect a serious problem. From considerable plant data gathered, it is known that the proportion $y$ of impurities in a batch has a density function given by $$f(y) = 10(1−y)^9,\quad 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.$$ A batch is considered not acceptable if the percentage of impurities exceeds $60\%$ . With the current quality of the process, what is the percentage of batches that are not acceptable? I found this quantity as such: We can take integral $\int_{0.60}^1 10(1-y)^9dy$ and use transformation to see that it is equivalent to the negative integral $\int_{0.4}^0 10x^9dx$ , which, then, is equivalent to $\int_0^{0.4}10x^9\, dx$ . I perform the integration and get the value $$0.00010408576 \quad \text{or} \quad 0.01048576\%~\text{of batches!}$$ That's all fine and good. But what of the follow-up questions? For the random variable Y in the previous problem a. Find the expected percentage of impurities. b. Find the expected value of the proportion of quality material (i.e., $E[1-y]$ ). What is meant by this? Did we not just find the $\%$ of batches impure? What exactly is being asked by a? I imagine once we have a, finding b my be simple. Thoughts? Direction?","['statistics', 'probability', 'functions']"
