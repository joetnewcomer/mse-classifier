334914,Combinatorial proof of binomial coefficient summation identity,"I am trying to get a combinatorial proof for this summation identity, for $0\leq k\leq \frac{n}{2}$
$$\sum_{m=k}^{n-k}\binom{m}{k}\binom{n-m}{k}=\binom{n+1}{2k+1}$$ The way I interpreted is that, for the right hand side $\binom{n+1}{2k+1}$ is the number of ways to choose $2k+1$ from total of $n+1$, then for left hand side, condition on dividing $n+1$ into two groups of size $m+1$ and $(n+1)-(m+1)=n-m$, then if choose $k$ the group of $n-m$ then it gives $\binom{n-m}{k}$, so there are $2k+1-k=k+1$ to choose from the group of size $m+1$, this is $\binom{m+1}{k+1}$, therefore I got the left hand side as $\sum_{m=k}^{n-k}\binom{m+1}{k+1}\binom{n-m}{k}\neq\sum_{m=k}^{n-k}\binom{m}{k}\binom{n-m}{k}$. what did I do wrong here? please help.",['combinatorics']

334930,Doubts about Hausdorff measure.,"I am studying real analysis and I have some problems in understanding properties of Hausdorff measure. Let $\mathcal{E}_\delta$ be collection of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^N$ whose diameter is less then $\delta$. Now $\mathcal{E}_\delta$ has the property that for every $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$ there exists a countable collection $\{ Q_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subseteq \mathcal{E}_\delta$ such that $E \subseteq \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}Q_n$ (to see this we may observe that $\mathbb{R}^N$ could be partitioned in a numerable union of dyadic cubes, each with diameter arbitrarily small). Now define 
$$ \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\delta}(E)=\inf \left\{ \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \text{diam}(E_n)^\alpha \,\middle|\, E \subseteq \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \ \text{and} \  \left\{E_n \right\} \subseteq \mathcal{E}_\delta  \right\}
$$
By the properties of infimum we deduce that if $\delta_1 \le \delta_2$ then $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\delta_2}(E) \le \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\delta_1}(E)$. So it make sense define the Hausdorff outer $\alpha$-measure of $E$ by
$$\mathcal{H}_\alpha(E)=\sup_{\delta>0} \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\delta}=\lim_{\delta \to 0^+}\mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\delta}
$$
Now $\mathcal{H}_\alpha$ is an outer measure, and if consider the collection $\mathcal{A}$ of sets $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$ such that
$$\mathcal{H}_\alpha(A)=\mathcal{H}_\alpha(E \cap A) + \mathcal{H}_\alpha(A\setminus E), \ \ \forall A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N \ \ \ \ \ (*)
$$
we can prove (using the Carathéodory Extension Theorem ) that $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, and we say that $\mathcal{A}$ is the collection of Hausdorff $\alpha$-measurable sets. Now I have two questions: There are some difference between $\mathcal{A}$ and the collection of Lebesgue measurable sets? There is some subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ that is not Hausdorff $\alpha$-measurable? For answering the second question I taken $(*)$, that for sub-additivity of outer measure holds ever with the sign $\le$ at place of $=$ and I looked for a subset $E$ of $\mathbb{R}^N$ for that exists a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^N$ such that $(*)$ holds with strict inequality. For the candidate of $E$ I have taken the Vitali set $V$, and for the set $A$ I take the set
$$A= \bigcup_{q \in (-1,1) \cup \mathbb{Q}} V+q$$
where $V+q$ is the translated of Vitali set (like the proof that $V$ is not Lebesgue measurable). I easy to see that $V+q_1 \cap V+q_2=\emptyset$ if $q_1 \neq q_2$. Now what remain to check is that holds the strict inequality
$$ \mathcal{H}_{1}(A)<\mathcal{H}_1(V)+\mathcal{H}_1 \left(A \setminus V\right)$$ Where
$$A \setminus V =\bigcup_{q \in(-1,1) \cap \mathbb{Q}\setminus \{0\} } V+q $$
Now $V \subseteq (0,1)$, then $A \subseteq (-1,2)$ so for the sub-additivity $\mathcal{H}_1(V) \le 1$ and $\mathcal{H}_1(A) \le 3$, and if we can show that $\mathcal{H}_1(A \setminus V)=\mathcal{H}_1(A)$ and $\mathcal{H}_1(V)>0$ we are done. 
But if the above reasoning were false and the Vitali set were Hausdorff $1$-measurable, then the first question would have answer.","['dimension-theory-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
334934,$|f(x)-f(y)|\le(x-y)^2$ without gaplessness,"If $|f(x)-f(y)|\le(x-y)^2$ for all $x,y\in\mathbb R$, then it's easy to show that $f'=0$ everywhere, and the mean value theorem implies that that means $f$ is constant.  If there were a gap in the real line and $f=3$ on one side of the gap and $f=4$ on the other side of the gap, then $f'=0$ everywhere but $f$ is not constant.  Gaplessness enters via the mean value theorem. But I wonder if the proposition holds even in a line with gaps.  For example if $f:\mathbb Q\to\mathbb Q$ and for all $x,y\in\mathbb Q$ this inequality holds, does that imply $f$ is constant?  And what about other gap-filled lines than $\mathbb Q$?  Such as $\mathbb R\setminus A$ where $A$ is a finite set, or a countable set, or a set whose complement is dense, or whatever set it might be of interest to ask this question about?","['general-topology', 'inequality', 'real-analysis', 'metric-spaces']"

335062,Vandermonde identity in a ring,"Let $R$ be a commutative $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra. For $r \in R$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we can define the binomial coefficient $\binom{r}{n}$ as usual by $\binom{r}{0}=1$ and $\binom{r}{n+1}=\frac{r-n}{n+1} \cdot \binom{r}{n}$. I would like to prove the following identity for $r,s \in R$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$: $$\binom{r+s}{n}=\sum_{p+q=n} \binom{r}{p} \cdot \binom{s}{q}$$ For $r,s \in \mathbb{N}$ this is known as the Vandermonde identity . For $R=\mathbb{C}$ it is known as the Chu–Vandermonde identity. In general, let's just call it the Vandermonde identity in $R$. One can prove the identity for general $R$ by observing that both sides are polynomials in $r,s$, so that it suffices to consider $R=\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$ with $r=x$, $s=y$. Then the polynomials agree on $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ by the usual Vandermonde identity. Hence they are equal (using that $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{A}^2$ is Zariski dense). See also Darij Grinberg's notes on $\lambda$-rings , Theorem 3.2. Question. Is there a more direct and algebraic proof of the Vandermonde identity in a given commutative $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra $R$? I am looking for a proof which works directly for $R$, without any reduction arguments. There should be some proof which just consists of simple algebraic manipulations. I have tried induction on $n$, but didn't succeed.

335108,How can I model multiplication of two sets of integers,"First a disclaimer, I am a physician and nowhere near a mathematician. I am struggling with a problem in which I want to model a set of equations using a discrete system. For example I want to calculate a list of totals when a prescription frequency can be $\left \{2,4,6 \right \}$ and the amount can be $\left \{5,10,15 \right \}$. This gives a set of possible totals of $\left \{10,20,30,40,60,90 \right \}$. My first, naive, solution was to model the set like: 
$$\text{Factor } n = a + bx \wedge x = \left \{ x \in \mathbb{N}: x \le (c - a) \div b \wedge (a + bx) \mid d \right \} $$
Where $a$ is the minimum value in the set, $b$ is the increment of the set, $c$ is the maximum of the set and $d$ is a dividend, of which the set is a divisor. Thus, I can describe the frequency as: $\text{Factor } n = 2 + 2x \wedge x = \left \{ x \in \mathbb{N}: x \le (6 - 2) \div 2 \wedge (2 + 2x) \mid \infty \right \} = \left \{ 2,4,6 \right \}$. But what happens when I multiply such a set definition with another set? If there is no maximum, i.e. $c = \infty$, no problem, the resulting set is just a multiple of the multiplication, i.e. $b_{result} = b_1 \times b_2$. And $a_{result} = a_1 \times a_2$ as is $b_{result}$. But, obviously, this is not correct when $c \neq \infty $, or $d \neq \infty$. There are two possible solutions, either generate the set and use that in subsequent calculations (can get messy) or come up with some sort of equation that can generate the set (the prefered strategy). What I want to accomplish is that a set of equations like: $total = frequency \times quantity$ and $quantity = runtime \times infusionrate$ can be solved, while disallowing entries that have no solution. For example if $total = 9$ and frequency is a multiple of 1 than quantity cannot be set at 5, thus the equation with the above values would set the dividend of quantity to 9, limiting quantity to divisors of 9.

335151,Why is this group action a morphism of varieties?,"I am examining a proof that any affine connected algebraic group is a closed subgroup of some $GL_n$, and I am stuck on a fine point. Let $G$ be an affine algebraic group in the sense that it is a group and also an affine variety over an algebraically closed field $k$, and such that the multiplication map $G\times G\rightarrow G$ and inverse map $G\rightarrow G$ are morphisms of varieties. Suppose that it is also connected. $G$'s action on itself by (right or left) multiplication induces an action of $G$ on its coordinate ring $k[G]$. I have been convinced by the proof I am studying that there exists a finite-dimensional $k$-linear subspace $W\subset k[G]$ that is $G$-invariant and on which $G$ acts faithfully: essentially, if $f_1,\dots,f_m$ are $k$-algebra generators for $k[G]$, then all the $g(f_i)$'s live in a finite-dimensional subspace of $k[G]$ and this is $W$. This gives us an inclusion $$\varphi:G\hookrightarrow GL(W)$$ so that $G$ is realized as a subgroup of $GL(W)\cong GL_n$ for $n=\dim W$. The argument I am studying now asserts that $\varphi$ is a morphism (with the variety structure on $GL(W)$ given by its identification with $GL_n\subset k^{n\times n}\cong \mathbb{A}_k^{n^2}$) and deduces that the image of $\varphi$ is a closed subvariety of $GL(W)$. I believe the argument except that I am having trouble explaining to myself why $\varphi$ has to be a morphism. Why is $\varphi$ a morphism? Here are my (very few) thoughts so far: selecting a basis $w_1,\dots,w_n$ for $W$, we can describe the $g$-action on $W$ in terms of its action on the basis: $$ g(w_i)=\sum_j c_{ij}(g)w_j$$ Then $g\mapsto (c_{ij}(g))$ is an explicit description of $\varphi$. $c_{ij}:G\rightarrow k$ is the pullback of the $ij$th coordinate function on $GL(W)$ under $\varphi$. I need to know that this is a regular function on $G$. It must be implied by the fact that the multiplication map $G\times G\rightarrow G$ is a morphism. This would be sufficient. Technically I also need to know that the pullback of $1/\delta$ is regular, where $\delta$ is the determinant function on $GL(W)$ (this is because the coordinate ring of $GL(W)$ is generated by the coordinate functions and $1/\delta$). However, it follows from $c_{ij}$ being regular for each $i,j$, because the pullback of $1/\delta$ is $1/\det (c_{ij}(g))$. If the $c_{ij}$ are all regular, then $\det (c_{ij})$ is regular, and nonvanishing, so $1/\det (c_{ij})$ is regular. That's as far as I've gotten.

I find this quite counter-intuitive, because I always thought that only a $C^0$-continuous surface (i.e. containing a kink) can have infinite curvature. What am I missing? Long version: Since the curvature of a curve is defined as $1/r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle that best describes the curve at the point of interest, infinite curvature is only possible when the circle has zero radius (it reduces to a single point ). In case of a $C^0$-connection between two parametric curves, it is obvious that the curvature goes to infinity. But apparently, this can also happen when two parametric curves meet with $C^1$-continuity. Any examples (e.g. using parametric polynomial curves)? With regard to surfaces — the two principal curvatures $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ at the point $(u,v)$ of a parametric surface $X(u,v)$ are respectively the minimum and maximum normal curvature at this point $(u,v)$. The normal curvature in the direction $\phi$ is obtained when a plane containing the normal at $(u,v)$ is oriented in the direction $\phi$. The intersection of this plane and the surface results in a curve — the curvature of this curve in our point $(u,v)$ is called the normal curvature in the direction of $\phi$. The Gaussian curvature $\kappa_G$ is simply the product of the two principal curvatures, the mean curvature $\kappa_M$ is the sum of the two principal curvatures. If the Gaussian curvature is infinite, then at least one of the principal curvatures has to be infinite as well. I always thought that the curve (i.e. the intersection of the plane — oriented in the corresponding principal direction — and the surface) should therefore contain a kink, but apparently this does not have to be true. What am I missing?","['curvature', 'continuity', 'differential-geometry']"

My current thought process is this: In order for $ f = u + iv $ to be analytic, it must differentiable. Therefore, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equation, $ f_{y} = if_{x} $ , and $ f_{x} \text{ and } f_{y} $ must be continuous. The Cauchy-Riemann equation is equivalent to: $$ u_{x} = v_{y},\\ u_{y} = -v_{x} $$ Because the function must be analytic, they must be differentiable on open neighborhoods of $ z = x + iy $ as well as at z. Because of this fact, I tried doing this: $$ u_{x} = v_{y} \implies v_{y} = 2x \implies v = 2xy + h(x)\\
   u_{y} = -v_{x} \implies v_{x} = 2y  \implies v = 2xy + g(y) $$ These two lines imply that $ h(x) = g(y) = constant $, so $ v = 2xy + c $. Thus, functions of the form $ f = x^{2} - y^{2} + i(2xy + c) $ should be analytic. I have two problems. The first problem is that I'm not confident my derivation of v is sound mathematics.

336077,Prove $|Im(z)|\le |\cos (z)|$ for $z\in \mathbb{C}$.,"Let $z\in \mathbb{C}$ i.e. $z=x+iy$. Show that $|Im(z)|\le |\cos (z)|$. My hand wavy hint was to consider $\cos (z)=\cos (x+iy)=\cos (x)\cosh (y)+i\sin (x)\sinh(y)$ then do ""stuff"". Then I have $|\cos (z)|=|Re(z)+iIm(z)|$ and the result will be obvious. Thanks in advance. I am missing something trivial I know.","['inequality', 'complex-analysis']"
336093,"The weak $\sigma$-$(V,V')$ topology on a normed space V is Hausdorff?","The weak $\sigma$-$(V,V')$ topology on a normed space V is Hausdorff? So it is claimed that The weak $\sigma$-$(V,V')$ topology on a BANACH space V is Hausdorff? In my proof I used the Hahn-Banach theorem to find the existence of linear function that separates any two arbitrarily chosen points. Then it easily follows that V is Hausdorff w.r.t the weak topology. Nowhere can I see the necessity of V being a Banach space. So it holds true when V is just a normed space?",['functional-analysis']
