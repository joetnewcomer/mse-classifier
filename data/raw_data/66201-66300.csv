782749,How to make sense of the inverse image of a Weil divisor?,"I was reading Hartshorne's proof that $Cl(X \times \mathbb A^n)=Cl(X)$. He defines the map $Cl(X) \to Cl(X \times A^n)$ by mapping the class of a prime divisor $D$ of $X$ to $p^{-1}(D)$ where $p:X \times A^n \to X$ the projection. I am not sure I understand what $p^{-1}(D)$ means. Is it just the scheme theoretic inverse of $D$ ie $D \times_X (X \times_k A^n)$? would that be the same as $D \times_k A^n$ as intuition would suggest? Finally, does this generalizes to an arbitrary morphism $f:Z \to Y$?",['algebraic-geometry']

782956,Motivation for the study of Jacobi Theta Functions,"The wikipedia definition says: ""There are several closely related functions called Jacobi theta functions, and many different and incompatible systems of notation for them.

It is given by the formula"" $$\vartheta(z; \tau) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \exp (\pi i n^2 \tau + 2 \pi i n z)= 1 + 2 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(e^{\pi i\tau}\right)^{n^2} \cos(2\pi n z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty q^{n^2}\eta^n""$$ This definition is perfectly fine for me, no problem.

782957,Sigma algebra generated by the set of all singletons,"Let $S=\{\{x\}\mid x \in \mathbb{R}\}$. Is $\sigma(S)$ included in the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$? Is $\sigma(S)$ equivalent to the Borel $\sigma$-algbrea on $\mathbb{R}$? I think the answer to the first question is yes. Because the Borel sets include singletons, the Borel $\sigma$-algebra must contain the smallest sigma-algebra of the set of all singletons. Here's my attempt at the second question: my answer would be no. Countable unions (or intersections) of countable sets are countable, so that any $X \in \sigma(S)$ is either countable or a compliment of a countable set. Therefore, the interval $(0,1) \not \in \sigma (S)$ but it is included in the Borel $\sigma$-algebra.

Prove that $|f(1/3)|\geq 1/5$ . Hint: use the invariant form of Schwarz's Lemma. As I understand it, the hint refers to the result that for any holomorphic $f:\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{D}$ , we have $$\left|\frac{f(z_1)-f(z_2)}{1-\overline{f(z_1)}f(z_2)}\right|\leq\left|\frac{z_1-z_2}{1-\overline{z_1}z_2}\right|$$ for any $z_1,z_2\in\mathbb{D}$ .

I'm worried I'm not understanding something correctly, and the exam is tomorrow, so any quick help would be much appreciated. P.S. I found this exercise here , where it is problem 5.

For then and only then is it possible to bring to bear tools from analysis such as stability theory, bifurcation theory and analysis theory.

783205,When does $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n^{1/n} = \alpha$ imply $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{x_n}{\alpha^n}$ exists?,"Let $x_n$ be a sequence of numbers satisfying

=   0, \quad \text{and } \quad
    \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{x_n}{x_{n-1}}

\in (0,1).
$$
From this it follows that 
$$
  \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n^{1/n}

my question is, under what conditions (the milder the better) can one conclude that the limit
$$
  L
= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x_n}{\alpha^n}
$$
exists? I don't think it is true in general, but there are extra properties that the $x_n$ satisfy which may be germaine and sufficient to secure the result; for the moment though, I'll keep the question unfettered by potential red herrings. Some thoughts which may or may not be useful:
the sequence $\phi_n := \frac{x_n}{\alpha^n}$ can be shown to be submultiplicative, i.e. 
$$
     \phi_{n+m}
\leq \phi_n \phi_m, \quad n,m \in \mathbb{N},

and since $x_n$ decreases from $1$ to $0$, there is a point at which it ""crosses"" the line $y = \alpha$, after which point $\frac{x_n}{\alpha} < 1$. EDIT Etienne gave a nice answer. It did not apply directly to my specific situation, but I believe it handles the original question nicely. The additional details of my specific problem are unlikely to be searched for - at least much less likely than the original question. So I'll accept the answer and leave it at that!

783312,Automorphisms of abelian groups and Choice,"The latest question to be asked at the Group Pub Forum is a classic: can every group be realised as the automorphism group of a group? The answer is no, and the canonical answer is the infinite cyclic group. See this answer of mine for the details. In the back-and-forth mailings Arturo Magidin made the following point, which I would never have realised: A infinite group of exponent two may not have an automorphism of order two. It depends on the Axiom of Choice. That is, if we assume choice then your group is the direct sum of infinitely many copies of $C_2$ and we can simply choose a pair of $C_2$s in the direct sum decomposition and switch them. Indeed, the direct sum will have automorphism group containing $S_{\infty}$. My question is therefore the following. Question: Do not assume choice. What might the automorphism group of an infinite group of exponent two look like? If it cannot be infinite cyclic then the canonical counter-example to the motivating question holds. But I don't really care about the motivating question, I am just interested on what is going on here... (As an aside, I am not that comfortable with axioms - is ""not assuming choice"" the same as ""assuming choice does not hold""? Is there some middle ground which sits before I decide to use choice or not?

  show that $AB = 0$ does not imply that either $A$ or $B$ is the zero matrix, but that it does imply that at least one of them is singular. So, my reasoning was the following: It's not difficult to compute $AB = \left( \begin{matrix}

783633,Tangent bundle of P^n and Euler exact sequence,"I'm thinking about the Euler exact sequence for complex projective space, and I'm a bit confused. In the topological category, one has $$ T\mathbb{P}^n \oplus \mathbb{C} \cong L^{n+1} $$ where $L$ is the tautological line bundle and $\mathbb{C}$ is the trivial line bundle. This comes from a splitting of the vector bundle homomorphism $\mathbb{C}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n/L$ which you can get by picking a Hermitian metric. In algebraic geometry, you get a (non-split) exact sequence, which is the dual of the Euler sequence ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_sequence ). Is the Euler sequence for the holomorphic tangent bundle of $\mathbb{P}^n$ split as above? It would seem so, since even though we are in the holomorphic setting we can run the first argument with the Fubini-Study metric, but I've read some things that seem to suggest otherwise.","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
783654,Simple differential equations problems,"I have an ODE. $$
yy^{\prime\prime}-2(y^{\prime})^2+2y^{\prime}=0.
$$
My lecturer got the answer
$$
y=C,
$$
where $C$ is an arbitrary constant, or
$$
y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{C_1}}\tan(\sqrt{C_1}x+C_2),
$$
where $C_1,C_2$ are arbitrary constants, $C_1>0$. But I think the solution may differ due to the sign of $C_1$. Let $y^{\prime}=v$, then
$$
y^{\prime\prime}=\frac{dv}{dx}=\frac{dv}{dy}\frac{dy}{dx}=v\frac{dv}{dy}. 
$$
So this ODE becomes 
$$
vy\frac{dv}{dy}-2v^2+2v=0.
$$
Case 1: $v=0$, then $y=C$, $C$ is an arbitrary constant; Case 2: if $v\ne0$, then separate variables, giving
$$
\frac{1}{v-1}dv=\frac{2}{y}dy. 
$$
Integrate both sides, we have 
$$
\int\frac{1}{v-1}\mathrm{d}v=\int\frac{2}{y}\mathrm{d}y, 
$$
i.e.,
$$
\ln|v-1|=\ln y^2+\ln|K|,
$$
where $K$ is a non-zero constant. So we have
$$
e^{\ln|v-1|}=e^{\ln|K|}e^{\ln{y^2}}, 
$$
and finally 
$$
|v-1|=|K|y^2.
$$
Therefore,
$$
v-1=\pm|K|y^2.
$$
Let $C_1=\pm|K|$, then 
$$
v=C_1y^2+1,
$$
where $C_1$ is a non-zero constant. Separate variables again, we get
$$
\int\frac{1}{C_1y^2+1}\mathrm{d}y=\int \mathrm{d}x. 
$$ 
Here is the problem: if $C_1<0$, we cannot use the integral
$$
\int\frac{1}{x^2+a^2}\mathrm{d}x=\frac{1}{a}\arctan\frac{x}{a}+C, 
$$
where $C$ is an arbitrary constant, instead, we need to use 
$$

783681,The meaning of Differentials in Integration,"This is further to the questions discussed in a previous post Here is an example of what I mean: Suppose that $C$ is a closed path in the plane and consider the line integral of $xy\,dx+x^2\,dy$ over $C$. Note that this can be written as $$\oint_C x\,d(xy)$$ Question: If we let $A$ denote the starting and ending point of the path, is it valid to use ""Integration by Parts"" to write $$\oint_C x\,d(xy)=x\cdot xy\bigg|_A^A -\oint_C xy\cdot dx=-\oint_C xy\cdot dx$$ Note that the claim is valid , as the sum of the two integrands is $2xy\,dx+x^2\,dy$ which is conservative, being the gradient of $f(x,y)=x^2y$. Therefore the sum of the two integrals in the last equation is zero, hence they are negatives of each other. (And obviously, the second integral will usually be more desirable to compute than the first.) But what does this mean, and why is it true? More generally, I think it would insightful to have a discussion about differentials in the context of integration and how/why the Leibniz notation can or cannot be used to intuitively understand calculations such as the above. And how can we interpret differentials of general quantities which may involve several variables, as opposed to just single ones? Does the expression $d(xy)$ only make sense in the context of a path $C$, where we can view it as the change in $g(x,y)=xy$ over small segments of that curve, or does it admit a broader interpretation?","['notation', 'multivariable-calculus', 'math-history']"

783871,Can we prove the Cauchy-Riemann equations using the matrix form of a complex number?,"The definition of being complex-differentiable at $z$ can be stated as the existence of $a\in\mathbb C$ such that: $$f(z+h)-f(z)=ah+r(h)|h|$$ For all $h$, where $r(z)\to0$ as $z\to0$. Thinking of complex numbers as elements of $\mathbb R^2$ in the obvious way, this is asserting the existence of a differential for $f:\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R^2$ at $z$, where that differential is the mapping $z\to az$, which is of course a linear function (its obvious $\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R^2$ analogue is linear, I mean). But if the mapping if of the form $z\to az$, this implies that its matrix must have a very specific form. The linear mapping $(\Re (z), \Im (z))\to (\Re (az), \Im (az))$ can be shown to always have a matrix in the canonical basis of the form $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}
x&-y\\ y&x
\end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$. But when we compare that to the Jacobian matrix of $f$ at $z$, we get the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Can this be made rigorous?

I would like to understand why the second method is preferred (or perhaps the only valid one). Method 1 (my attempt): We are given the nine field axioms for $\Bbb R$. Using these, it has been shown (in the text) that $(-1)x = -x$ for all $x \in \Bbb R$. Therefore, $(-1)(-1) = -(-1) = 1$ because we have the identity element of multiplication $1 \in \Bbb R$ and there exists $ -1 \in \Bbb R$ such that $-1$ is the additive inverse of $1$. Method 2 (found by Google search): We know that $(0)(0) = 0$ because it was shown (in the text) that $0x = 0$ for all $x \in \Bbb R$. Then $$(0)(0) = ((-1) + 1)*((-1) + 1) = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(1) \\= (-1)(-1) - 1 - 1 + 1 = (-1)(-1) - 1 = 0$$ Therefore $(-1)(-1) = 1$ because we see that $(-1)(-1)$ is the additive inverse of $-1$.

On the other hand, one has the exact sequence of the closed subscheme $$ 0 \rightarrow \mathcal{I}_Y \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow \iota_* \mathcal{O}_Y \rightarrow 0.$$ If $\mathcal{F}$ is locally free, then we can tensor this up to get the sequence $$ 0 \rightarrow \mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{I}_Y \rightarrow \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{F} \otimes \iota_* \mathcal{O}_Y \rightarrow 0.$$ I had always thought, and even denoted, both the sheaves $\mathcal{F}_Y$ and $\mathcal{F} \otimes \iota_* \mathcal{O}_Y$ as $\mathcal{F}|_Y$ (note that $\mathcal{F} \otimes \iota_* \mathcal{O}_Y = \iota_* (\iota^* \mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{O}_X)$, but I guess they can't be equal since e.g. $\mathcal{F}_U \neq \mathcal{F}(-Y)$ - one is a vector bundle and the other isn't. Somewhere in all the sheafification stuff, I've lost my head and I'm 
seeking some intuition about the difference between $\mathcal{F}_Y$ and $\mathcal{F} \otimes \iota_* \mathcal{O}_Y$. For instance, continuing to assume that $\mathcal{F}$ is a vector bundle, the second sheaf (I think) should correspond to the restriction of the vector bundle to $Y$; what is the first sheaf?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'vector-bundles']"

784328,"Precise meaning of ""Solution in radicals""","I'm wondering precisely what is meant by the phrase ""solution in radicals"".  We know that general quintic (5th degree) polynomials don't have a solution in radicals.  I'm wanting a ""formal"" description of what that phrase means in the symbol-manipulation/computer-algorithms sense.  I've seen lots of imprecise and ambiguous wording in English that glosses over what that means, and all of those definitions seem to be lacking.  Take for example the entry at Britannica : At stake was the existence of a formula that expresses the roots of a quintic equation in terms of the coefficients. This formula, moreover, must involve only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, together with the extraction of roots, since that was all that had been required for the solution of quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations. If such a formula were to exist, the quintic would accordingly be said to be solvable by radicals. Notice the omission of exponentation, which I assume is a typo, but it of course can be recovered by taking reciprocal roots (e.g. $ x^3 = \sqrt[^1/_3]{x} $ ).  Ignoring that issue for the moment, this would seem to allow terms like: $ \pi^a $ $ e^{a \pi i} $ $ \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} $ $ \sqrt[\pi]{a^{b^c}} $ $ i^a $ ...where $ a,b,... $ (etc.) are coefficients of the original polynomial (i.e. $ ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f $ ).  This seems pretty typical of the information out there, where there are a lot of potential ambiguities. Wikipedia's entry for Algebraic Solution , is different (more accurate?), stating: An algebraic solution or solution in radicals is a closed form expression, and more specifically a closed-form algebraic expression, that is the solution of an algebraic equation in terms of the coefficients, relying only on addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to integer powers, and the extraction of roots (square roots, cube roots, etc.). ...differences include ""raising to integer powers"", and extraction of roots, but not being exactly clear if the n of nth root can be irrational, imaginary, or a coefficient of the equation.  The mention of ""raising to integer powers"" seems a little odd, since I can effectively raise to rational powers by combining exponentation and root extraction $ a^{^7/_{16}} = \sqrt[16]{a^7} $ Also missing is the mention of a finite number of terms, which is present in a lot of presentations.  I also assume that we're talking about a fixed number of terms, so there would be no number of terms depending on an intermediate calculation, or towers of exponents based on a coefficient.  And there is no mention if the use of transcendental constants are allowed. To that end, I'd like an executable computer algorithm that describes the form of a ""solution in radicals"".  Here's one attempt at a ""solution in radicals"" checker using Mathematica notation: radicalsQ[_Symbol] := True

If $\phi$ has a kernel, can we necessarily say that the quotient group $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} / \ker(\phi)$ has the form $\mathbb{Z}_m \oplus \mathbb{Z}_n$, where $m$ and $n$ are some integers? If not, can we still nicely represent all the quotient groups of $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} / \ker(\phi)$, where $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$? Moreover, how does the matrix representation of $\phi$ relate to the quotient groups? For example, does the determinant of the matrix give you all or most of the information you need to find the quotient groups? My motivation in considering this is, as I mentioned, $k$-fold covers of $\mathbb{T}^2$. The fundamental group of $\mathbb{T}^2$ is of course $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$. I want to relate the determinant of $\phi$ to how many times a covering map covers $\mathbb{T}^2$. For example, a $k$-fold cover $p: \mathbb{T}^2 \to \mathbb{T}^2$ would have $\det(p_\star) = k$. Where $p_\star: \pi_1(\mathbb{T}^2) \to \pi_1(\mathbb{T}^2)$ is the induced homomorphism . I'm not sure that this is true, but it motivated my question.
