1020712,Evaluating $\sum_{n=i}^{\infty} {2n \choose n-i}^{-1}$,"$\displaystyle \sum_{n=i}^{\infty} {2n \choose n-i}^{-1}=\sum_{n=i}^{\infty} \frac {1}{{2n \choose n-i}}$ is a very interesting one. Here is what I have from WolframAlpha. $$\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} {2n \choose n}^{-1}=\frac{2}{27}(18+\sqrt{3}\pi)$$ $$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {2n \choose n}^{-1}=\frac{1}{27}(9+2\sqrt{3}\pi)$$ $$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {2n \choose n-1}^{-1}=\frac{1}{27}(9+5\sqrt{3}\pi)$$ For $i \geq 2$ , WA just comes up with closed forms involving generalised hypergeometric functions. Here is one example . I would conjecture that this is still in fact expressible in terms of the sort of form we see above but I have no clue about hypergeometric functions so I was hoping somebody could enlighten me. Also, it looks like some sort of computational artefact of not being able to start the sum at $n=1$ . It seems to give a natural, consistent form for the first two cases ( $i=0,1$ ), and when asking WA to sum it in the case $i=1$ , but starting from $n=2$ , it uses a hypergeometric function in the answer , whereas we know the answer should in fact be $\frac{1}{27}(-18+5\sqrt{3}\pi)$ . Also, could anybody come up with a (more elementary i.e. anything not involving special functions) proof of the formula $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {2n \choose n}^{-1}=\frac{1}{27}(9+2\sqrt{3}\pi)$ ?

1020744,"Sums of consecutive odd integers, positive or negative","While supervising a student competition, my colleague and I ran across an interesting problem. Deobfuscated, it boils down to this Given a limit value $M$, which integers in the range $1,\dotsc,M-1$ can be represented as a sum of consecutive odd numbers or their negatives, starting at $1$? The requirement is: represent a number in the above range as
$$
\sum_{i=0}^L(\pm)(2i + 1)
$$
for some upper limit value $L$. We also have the restriction that each prefix sum must be in $1,\dotsc,M-1$, namely
$$
1\le\sum_{i=0}^k(\pm)(2i + 1)< M
$$
for all $0\le k \le L$. For example, if $M = 17$ we can have sums $1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 16$, since, for example $11=1+3+5-7+9$. We conjecture that for $M\ge 50$ [ Edit : was 46, but I missed some cases], any target sum $1\le s< M$ is possible, which brings me to the questions Is this conjecture true? If so, what does the proof look like? Is this a tired old chestnut that we should have known?","['summation', 'elementary-number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Is it true that $\sqrt{2\sqrt{3\sqrt{4\sqrt{\ldots\sqrt{n}}}}}<3$ for any positive integer $n$? We cannot prove the statement using induction as it is, because the left-hand side is increasing while the right-hand side stays constant. So we need to modify the right-hand side to something like $3-\dfrac{1}{n}$. But it is hard to quantify how much the left-hand side increases when we go from $n$ to $n+1$.","['inequality', 'algebra-precalculus']"

I can show that if the translation length $|\gamma_1| = |\gamma_2|$ then the group contains a parabolic element, so either it's not cocompact, or it's not proper. How horrible can this group be?

1020919,Solve for constants: Derivatives using first principles,"Question Find the values of the constants $a$ and $b$ such that $$\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{\sqrt[3]{ax + b}-2}{x} = \frac{5}{12}$$ My approach Using the definition of the derivative, $$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$ I view limit as a derivative of a function $f$ at some value, let's call that value $c$, as follows :$$f'(c) = \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{f(c + x) - f(c)}{x} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{ax + b} - 2}{x} = \frac{5}{12}$$ Now I deduce the following: $$f(c + x)  = \sqrt[3]{ax + b}$$ and $$f(c) = 2$$ Use limits as follows: $$\lim_{x\to 0} f(c + x) = f(c) = 2$$ that is, $$\lim_{x\to 0} f(c + x) = \lim_{x\to 0} \sqrt[3]{ax + b} = \sqrt[3]{b} = 2$$ now solve for $b$, $$\sqrt[3]{b} = 2 \Leftrightarrow b = 8$$ Since I know that $$f(c + x) = \sqrt[3]{ax + 8}$$, I can solve for $a$, which is $$a = \frac{[f(c+x)]^3 - 8}{x} = \frac{[f(c+x)]^3 - [f(c)]^3}{x}$$ Let $g(x) = [f(x)]^3$, such that $$g'(x) = 3\cdot [f(x)]^2 \cdot f'(x)$$
so $$g'(c) = 3\cdot [f(c)]^2 \cdot f'(c) = 3 \cdot 4 \cdot \frac{5}{12} = 5$$ Rephrase $g'(c)$ using first principles such that $$g'(c) = \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{g(c + x)- g(c)}{x}= \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{[f(c + x)]^3 - [f(c)]^3}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0} a = 5$$ Since $a$ is a constant, $\lim_{x \to 0} a = a$, that is, $$a = 5$$ My solution: $b = 8, a = 5$.

1020949,Global Coordinates in Differential Geometry?,"In trying to learn a bit about differential geometry I have hit a puzzler. Most texts emphasize that one coordinate system will not suffice in general, but the reasoning is never given. After all, if a collection of open sets (the domains of the various coordinate mappings) cover the manifold and each is diffeomorphic with an open set of $R^n$, then why can't the local diffeomorphisms be ""continued"" so as to constitute a mapping of the whole manifold diffeomorphically to $R^n$? (In much the same way that a function analytic on an open set in the complex plane can be analytically extended to the entire plane.) This would allow one to establish a common origin for the coordinates, thereby placing all the onus of ""nonlinearity"" on the (global) coordinate mapping. I'm sure I am missing something, but could someone please tell me precisely what? Thanks.","['differential', 'geometry']"

I showed that you can create a third derivative test to my teacher (by showing that if the critical numbers of the second derivative = 0, and if the third derivative is non-zero, then it must be a point of inflection as the function is either increasing or decreasing on the second derivative graph), and he said it was right and to think about derivatives at higher orders like x^5 only has a derivative at x = 0 with the fifth derivative).

1021073,"Motivation for and differences between properties of measure, outer measure","This is related to my measure theory class, but it's not homework. The motivation behind this post is to understand the big picture relationship between properties of measure and outer measure. I understand the details of the how and what , but not the why . We have stated and proved many results in class, and the instructor explains nicely, but I need clarification. So a measure $\mu$ is a set function on a field $\mathcal{F}$ over an underlying set $\Omega$ such that it satisfies: $1.$ Nonnegativity, and can take on infinity as a value $\\$ $2.$ Zero measure of empty set $\\$ $3.$ Monotonicity $\\$ $4.$ Countable additivity for a disjoint subclass of $\mathcal{F}$, which implies finite additivity $5.$ Countable subadditivity for not necessarily disjoint subclass of $\mathcal{F}.$ Questions: For $\#5,$ why is the equation having $\leq$ and not $<$? Under what condition(s) can equality hold? Also, my notes say that countable subadditivty implies finite subadditivity, but how? An outer measure $\mu^{*}$ satisfies $\#1, \#2, \#3, \#5.$ According to my notes, monotonicity and C.S.A. are together weaker than countable additivity. Questions: Why? Also, why is $\mu^{*}$ defined over $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ while $\mu$ is not? Also, why is $\mu^{*}\bigg|\mathcal{M}(\mu^{*})$ finitely additive? Given the finite additivity of $\mu^{*}$, why isn't it C.S.A? Finally, what are the takeaways?","['motivation', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

1021227,"Prove that if $f$ is differentiable at $x=0$, then $f$ is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$.","$Conj:$ Suppose that a function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at $x=0$, satisfies $f(a + b) = f(a)f(b)$ for all $a,b,\in\mathbb{R}$, and is not identically zero ($\exists ~x$ such that $f(x) \neq 0$). Then $f$ is differentiable and  $f'(x) = f'(0)f(x)$. I think I need to show that $f(0) = 1$, $f(x)\neq 0$ for all $x$ and that $f$ is continuous if continuous at $f(0)$. Here's what I got so far: $Proof:$ $f$ not identically zero implies that there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) \neq 0$. Then: \begin{align}
f(x) &= f(x +a - a) & \text{(where $a \in \mathbb{R}$).}\\
& = f(x)f(a)f(-a) \\
& \neq 0
\end{align} Thus, $f(x)\neq 0$ implies that $f(a)\neq 0$ for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$. Furthermore, \begin{align}
f(0) & = f(0 + 0)\\
& = f(0)^2
\end{align} Thus, $f(0)$ must be either 0 or 1. We just showed that $f(x)\neq 0$ for all $x$, so $f(0)=1$. Now I need the continuity piece (I think) but I'm stuck. Thanks in advance!","['derivatives', 'real-analysis']"

Comment One can find $\epsilon$ non-constructively as follows: for otherwise we can choose $\{g_n\}\subseteq L^1[0,1]$ such that $\lVert g_n-f\rVert\to0$ and $\int_0^1\lvert g_n\rvert^2\le1$, then $\lvert g_n\rvert^2\to\lvert f\rvert^2$ in measure, and by Fatou's lemma , $\int_0^1\lvert f\rvert^2\ge1$, contradiction! However, I want to explicate an $\epsilon>0$, i.e. the perturbation radius, for each $f$. To start with, let's consider $f=c>1$ and fix $\epsilon>0$. We try to minimize $\int_0^1\lvert g\rvert^2$ under the assumption that $\lVert g-f\rVert=\eta\le\epsilon$. Let $h=f-g$, and it's natural to assume that $h>0$, since $\lvert g\rvert\ge\big\lvert\lvert f\rvert-\lvert h\rvert\big\rvert$. Then
$$I=\int_0^1\lvert g\rvert^2=c^2-2c\eta+\int_0^1\lvert h\rvert^2\ge c^2-2c\eta+\left(\int_0^1\lvert h\rvert\right)^2=(c-\eta)^2$$
If $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small, then $I_\mathrm{min}=(c-\epsilon)^2$ when taking $h=\epsilon$. If $f$ is arbitrary, maybe we can approximate $f$ by simple functions then obtain some good estimations. I have no clear idea on how to proceed next, and I hope we can obtain a good, if not best, $\epsilon$ for each $f$. Any idea? Thanks! Caveat One should note that the result is not that trivial, by seeing that on contrary, $\left\{\,f\in L^1[0,1]\,\big\vert\,\int_0^1\lvert f\rvert^2<1\,\right\}$ is however nowhere dense, and therefore $L^2[0,1]$ is meager in $L^1[0,1]$. It seems astonishing, but it should be clear after you recall the following facts: $h_\epsilon(x)=\epsilon/\sqrt x$ is small in $L^1$-norm but not square-integrable; The collection of continuous functions $C^0[0,1]$ with $L^1$-norm can be embedded densely in $L^1[0,1]$; For each $f\in C^0[0,1]$, we have $\int_0^1\lvert f+h_\epsilon\rvert^2=+\infty$.","['inequality', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

and
${p_i}$+(${p_j}$+d)$=n+d$ I have found very quickly counterexamples when the distance $d$ is set to $2$,$4$ or $8$: $d=2 n=38 n+2=40$ do not have any common primes in $G(38),G(40)$ $d=4 n=172 n+4=176$ do not have any common primes in $G(172),G(176)$ $d=8 n=38 n+8=46$ do not have any common primes in $G(38),G(46)$ But in the case $d=6$, I have run a test for the first $9000$ even numbers (after that point my computer slows down very much) and I did not find a counterexample (assuming the code is correct), so in the case of n and n+6, I have found always at least one common prime in $G(n)$ and $G(n+6)$, and the counterparts are a couple of sexy primes at least for any even number $n$ between $[8,9000]$. So another way of saying this is that there is always a couple of sexy prime shared between $G(n)$ and $G(n+6)$ when the even number $n$ is greater or equal to $8$. I am very curious because for $d=2,4,8$ was very easy to find a quick counterexample, but not in the case of d=6 probably because is greater than the $9000^{th}$ even number or a test error (I am assuming I did correctly my test, but it could happen). UPDATE 2015/04/09 Note: all the explanation above was assuming that: $\ \ n=p+q\ /\ p\le q$ and $\ \ n+6 = p+(q+6)$, But there is also the possibility that the common prime $p\gt q$ (*) .
  In that case, the sexy primes are $q$ in the list of primes of $G(n)$
  and $q-6$ in the list of primes of $G(n+6)$. Below there is an extension of the explanation (for the cases in which $p\le q$, but same idea would apply for (*) $p\gt q$): For any $n≥8$ even seems to exists at least a prime pair $(p,q)\ /\ n=p+q$, in which $p$ or $q$ has a sexy prime counterpart, e.g $q+6$, also prime, and $n+6=p+(q+6)$. E.g. $n=8=3+5$ and $n+6=14=3+11$, where the 'shared' or 'fixed' prime
  in $n=8$ and $n=14$ is $3$ and the sexy primes are $5$ in $n=8$ and
  $11(=5+6)$ in $n=14$. E.g.: $n=10=3+7$ and $n+6=16=3+13$, so the 'shared' prime is $3$ in
  $n=10$ and $n=16$ and the sexy primes are $7$ in $n=10$ and $13$ in
  $n=16$. E.g.: $n=17890=17837+53$ and $n+6=17896=17837+59$, in the same way
  than above. I still did not find counterexamples, every Goldbach partition of a given even number $n$ and $n+6$ seems to cover this property. E.g. this is a picture of a visualization of the list of Goldbach primes for each $n \in [466..480]$: Each column is the list of Goldbach primes for the even number $n$ written at the top, and the primes below (top-down) are in ascending order the primes $p$ able to sum up $n=p+q$, where $q$ is also prime. In the picture there are samples of the common prime behavior, in different colors, for the following even numbers $(n,n+6)$: $(n=466$,$n=472)$ $(n=468$,$n=474)$ $(n=470$,$n=476)$ $(n=472$,$n=478)$ $(n=474$,$n=480)$ E.g.
$n=466=5+461$ and $n=466+6=472=5+(461+6)=5+467$, so (a) in this example $p=5$ is in the list of Goldbach primes of $n=466$ and $n+6=472$, and (b) the sexy prime $q=461$ belongs to the list of $n=466$, and its counterpart sexy prime $q+6=467$ belongs to the list of Goldbach primes of $n=472$. But it seems it does not matter which random even $n\ge8$ is taken, always the list of Goldbach primes for the even number $n$ shares a prime $p$ with the list of $n+6$ and there is a couple of sexy primes $(q,q+6)$ (if $p \le q$) or $(q,q-6)$ (if $p \gt q$) shared between $n$ and $n+6$, $q$ belongs to the list of $n$ and $q+6$ (if $p \le q$) or $q-6$ (if $p \gt q$) belongs to the list of $n+6$.","['prime-numbers', 'goldbachs-conjecture', 'number-theory']"
1021688,$0=\frac{13+13^2+13^3+\cdots}{1+2+3+\cdots}$ using infinite sums?,"This is not homework, just curiosity. My question arose from the apparent absurdity that $\zeta(-1)=-\frac{1}{12}$, even though $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^z}$ only makes sense when $Re(z)>1$. Let $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n, \lvert{x}\rvert < 1$. It is known that $f(x)=\frac{1}{1-x}$. Let us now take the value of $f$ when $x=13$ (which also makes sense in the same way that taking $z=-1$ makes sense ). We then have: $$f(13) = \frac{1}{1-13}=-\frac{1}{12},$$ and consequently 
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty 13^n=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n,$$
$$1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty 13^n=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n,$$
$$1+\frac{13+13^2+13^3+\cdots}{1+2+3+\cdots}=1,$$ and finally
$$\frac{13+13^2+13^3+\cdots}{1+2+3+\cdots}=0.$$ Basically the idea is that in the case of $\zeta$, the LHS sum was divergent for the chosen parameter while the RHS was convergent, in the same way that in the case of $f$, the LHS diverged while the RHS was allowed to converge.

1021867,Change of Variables: which order of integration limits?,"An exercise in Larson/Edwards Calculus (10th ed.) asks the reader to evaluate the double integral $$\int_R\int 4(x^2+y^2)\,\mathrm{d}A$$
using a given change of variables
$$x=\frac{1}{2}(u+v)\mathrm{,}\quad y=\frac{1}{2}(u-v)$$
over the region pictured below. Since, with the given change of variables, $\,v=x-y\,$ and $\,u=x+y$, it looks like my $v$ limits of integration are going to be $-1$ and $1$, and my $u$ limits of integration are going to be $-1$ and $1$ as well.  My question is: how do I know which number should be the upper limit of integration and which number should be the lower limit of integration? Going off the picture, it looks like I should be integrating from $v=1$ to $v=-1$, and from $u=-1$ to $u=1$, so my integral would look like this: $$\int_{1}^{-1}\int_{-1}^{1}f(u,v)\,\mathrm{d}u\,\mathrm{d}v$$ This gives me the opposite of the correct answer (the correct answer multiplied by $-1$). I know I get the correct answer by integrating
$$\int_{-1}^{1}\int_{-1}^{1}f(u,v)\,\mathrm{d}u\,\mathrm{d}v$$
instead, but I don't see any reason why I ought to put the limits in that order. I suppose it might always be correct to choose the least of the two values to be the lower limit and the greatest of the two values to be the upper limit (thought I'm not sure), but even if that were so I still wouldn't really understand why that's the case. Edit: I tried writing the original integral without changing the variables, like this:
$$\int_{-1}^{0}\int_{-x-1}^{x+1}g(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}x+\int_0^1\int_{x-1}^{-x+1}g(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}x$$
and then manipulating the inequalities
$$-x-1\leq y\leq x+1\quad\mathrm{and}\quad x-1\leq y \leq -x+1$$
to find $-1\leq x+y\mathrm{,}$ $-1\leq x-y\mathrm{,}$ $x-y\leq 1\mathrm{,}$ and $x+y\leq 1$. Substituting $v$ for $x-y$ and $u$ for $x+y$, I get $-1\leq v\leq 1$ and $-1\leq u\leq 1$. Basing my limits of integration off these inequalities seems to work, but I'm not sure this procedure for finding limits of integration works in general.",['multivariable-calculus']

We know that if $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, then $L^p(\mu)$, $L^q(\mu)$ are reflexive and dual to each other. The proof could be found in Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis or Stein's Real Analysis , based on Radon-Nikodym's theorem. However, I see another proof from Brezis's book, although with assumption that $X=\Omega\subseteq\mathbb R^n$ is open and $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure, it seems that the proof could be generalized to the case that $(X,\mu)$ is any measure space, no matter whether $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite. For simplicity, we assume that $p\ge2$ and we only show that $L^p(\mu)$ is reflexive. We know from Rudin's text that $L^p(\mu)$ is a Banach space, no matter whether $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite.

1022268,Gathering books on Lorentzian Geometry,"I find it very hard to find books on Lorentzian Geometry, more focused on the geometry behind it, instead of books that go for the physics and General Relativity approach. More specifically, I'm talking about the Lorentzian manifolds and Lorentz-Minkowski spaces (some notations of it are $\Bbb L^n$, $\Bbb E^n_1$, etc). I know that the subject is recent (about $15$ years or so?), so we might not have a lot of texts about it anyway, but it costs nothing to try. I am not talking about isolated papers and articles, but of texts which make a systematic approach of the subject. I thought of making a list here, so we can gather some material, the most we can. I'll make a CW answer, and I invite everyone who knows something about it to give their two cents. Thanks.","['book-recommendation', 'differential-geometry', 'mathematical-physics', 'semi-riemannian-geometry', 'reference-request']"
1022279,A question related to cardinality and probability,"I have a question attached related to both probability and cardinality. Let me know if my formulation of the problem is non-rigorous or confusing. Any proof or suggestions are appreciated.Thank you all.
The question follows. Consider a set $I$ consists of $N$ incidents. $I=\{i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{k},...i_{N}\}$ Each incident has a probability to happen, i.e. incident $i_{k}$ happens with the probability $r_{k}$. Without loss of generality, we assume $r_{1}\geq r_{2}\geq ... \geq r_{k}\geq ... \geq r_{N}$
Given a constant $n<N$, we can have set $I_{1}=\{i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{n}\}$. Apparently, $|I_{1}|=n$ and $I_{1}\subset I$.
Define a mapping $I\to S$ with $S=\{s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{k},...s_{N}\}$
subject to $
s_{k} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
1 &\mbox{ (Pr=$r_{k}$)} \\
0 &\mbox{ (Pr=$1-r_{k}$)} \\
\end{array} \right.
$ Pick out the incidents with correspond $s$ being 1 to form the set $I_{2}$ , i.e. $I_{2}=\{i_{m_{1}},i_{m_{2}},...,i_{m_{M}}\} \quad \mbox{and} \quad s_{m_{k}}=1 \quad k=1,2,...,M $ Apparently, $|I_{2}|=M$ and $I_{2}\subset I$. Note that there could be $I_{2}\ne I_{1}$ and $|I_{2}| \ne |I_{1}|$. The question is,
If we have two set $A$ and $B$ with following assumptions: (1)$ A\subset I$ and $B\subset I$ (2)$|A|=|B|=n$ (3)$ |A \cap I_{1}| \geq |B \cap I_{1}| $ Is the following statement true? $ E(|A \cap I_{2}|) \geq E(|B \cap I_{2}|) $ where $E$ means expected value.
If this is true, how to prove it? If not, how to prove it’s not true?",['probability']

1022342,Need formal mathematical definition of this concept,"Assume we have a function $y=f(x)$ that is $\textit{C}^\infty$ and the function has a number of local maximums. Assume there are $k$ such maximums $\{m_1, m_2, m_3, \ldots , m_k\}$ where $f'(m_i)=0$. If I performed a gradient ascent algorithm for any point $x$ where $f(x)$ is defined, it would get to one of these local maximums $m_i$. In this way, every point $x$ where $f(x)$ is defined, it belongs to a certain local maximum (via gradient ascent). Is there a formal mathematical treatment of this concept that I just described? I have reduced it to two-dimensions, but I am looking to apply it to three dimensional surfaces.","['calculus', 'differential-geometry', 'general-topology', 'algorithms', 'analysis']"

So in discrete metric space, every Cauchy sequence is constant sequence and that way every Cauchy sequence is convergent sequence. Thus we conclude the discrete metric space is complete.

1022358,Finding Triangle with constant perimeter and largest area (Lagrange Multiplier),"Question is to find Finding Triangle with constant perimeter and largest area by method of lagrange multiplier . What i have done is that i have firstly taken $x+y+z=2k$ , where x,y,z are sides of triangle..k is any constant Then  i use Heron's formula as $\sqrt{s(s-x)(s-y)(s-z)}$ ,  where $s = (x +y+z)/2$ .... Since Area  = $\sqrt{s(s-x)(s-y)(s-z)}$ So substituting values of $s$  and replacing $z$ by $2k-x-y$ (to make it to two variable problem ) i finally get $f(x,y) = k(k-x)(k-y)(x+y-k)$   ...($A$ is squared so as to be easy easy derivatives) And my constraint equation is $g=x+y+z-2k=0 $
 .....But problem here is that constraint consists z also . So i feel stuck to use LAGRANGE MULTIPLIER Method.....Can any1 help me furthure what to do from here .THANKS","['multivariable-calculus', 'lagrange-multiplier']"
1022378,Notation Question with Line Integrals over Vector Field,"Previous Question: What is the Convention in Arc Length Parametrization? This is a follow-up question to my previous post on line integrals going in opposite directions.  At first I thought I understood it but later had another question.  My text denotes the smooth parametrization of $C$ by $\mathbf r:  [a, b] \rightarrow C$, and uses $u \in [0, L]$ as the arc-length parameter.  The line integral of a vector field is: $$\int_{C}\ F \cdot \mathbf T(u)\ du = \int_a^b\ F \cdot \mathbf r'(t)\ dt = \int_{C}\ F \cdot d \mathbf r$$ My best understanding of the last notation is to take the integral along $C$ as $\mathbf r$ varies.  Then, the text says that if you take the line integral of the vector field in the opposite direction, you will get the negative: $$-\int_{C}\ F \cdot d \mathbf r = \int_{-C}\ F \cdot d \mathbf r$$ I am not able to reconcile the various notations.  To my previous question, Mr. John D. wrote: $$\int_C \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{s}=\int_a^b \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{c}(t))\cdot\mathbf{c}'(t)\,dt=-\int_a^b \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{d}(t))\cdot\mathbf{d}'(t)\,dt=-\int_{-C}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{s}$$ where $\mathbf c, \mathbf d$ are parametrizations of $C$ running in opposite directions.  Thus, the equality in the middle makes sense; it follows the change of variable.  What about the first and third equality?  If $\mathbf s\ \text{(or}\ \mathbf r \text{)}$ parametrizes $C$ in one direction, how can you use the same thing to parametrize $C$ in the opposite direction, therefore yielding $-\int_{C}\ F \cdot d \mathbf s = \int_{-C}\ F \cdot d \mathbf s$?  In my opinion, it makes better sense to write $-\int_{C}\ F \cdot d \mathbf s = \int_{-C}\ F \cdot d (\mathbf -s)$.  What is your verdict on this?","['multivariable-calculus', 'line-integrals']"
1022421,Calculate the sine of an angle in coordenate geometry,"Given two lines $a_1x+b_1y+c_1 = 0$, $a_2x+b_2y+c_2 = 0$ that make an angle $\alpha$ at their intersection, show that
$$\sin\alpha = \frac{a_2b_1-a_1b_2}{\sqrt{a_1^2+b_1^2}\sqrt{a_2^2+b_2^2}}$$ So I'm stuck here, I'm thinking making a circle with the intersection point as it center and radius 1 and consider the intersections of the lines with the circle and from there calculating the sine, or making a rough right triangle and do the same as that.
