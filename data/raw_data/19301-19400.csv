160848,Boundedness of multiplication operator on $L^p$ spaces.,"I am asking myself when a $L^p\to L^q$ multiplication operator is continuous. The following should be true: Let $a:[0,1]\to\mathbb{C}$ be a measurable function.  Let $T_a: L^p([0,1])\to L^q([0,1])$, with $p,q\in[1,\infty]$, $p<q$,  be the operator of pointwise multiplication  by $a$, i.e., $(T_af)(x):=a(x)f(x)$. Then $T_a$ is continuous if and only if $a=0$ (almost everywhere). Any suggestion for a rigorous proof?","['functional-analysis', 'lp-spaces']"
160851,$PGL_2(q)$ acts on $\Omega$ $3-$transitively?,"Anyone who studies Permutation Groups will be encountering the following definition: A group $G$ acting on a set $\Omega$ is said to be “Sharply m-Transitive” iff $$\forall (a_1,a_2…,a_m) , (b_1,b_2…,b_m) \in \Omega^{m};\   ∃! g \in G  , a_i^g=b_i, 1\leq i\leq m$$ While reviewing my written notes in the class about group $PGL_2(q)$ , I have faced to this matter that $PGL_2(q)$ acting on set $\Omega=GF(q)\cup\{\infty\}$ is sharply $3-$ transitive. The idea for judging that is as follows: Since $PGL_2(q)=\{f|f:\Omega\longrightarrow\Omega, f(z)=\frac{az+b}{cz+d},ad-bc\neq 0; a,b,c,d\in GF(q)\}$ so we have $PGL_2(q)_{\infty}=\{f|f:\Omega\longrightarrow\Omega, f(z)= az+b ,a\neq 0; a,b\in GF(q)\}$ , $PGL_2(q)_{\infty,0}=\{f|f:\Omega\longrightarrow\Omega, f(z)= az ,a\neq 0; a\in GF(q)\}$ and $PGL_2(q)_{\infty,0,1}=\{f|f:\Omega\longrightarrow\Omega, f(z)= z\}=\{id\}$ . Knowing that $|PGL_2(q)|=q(q^2-1)$ , we get $| PGL_2(q)_{\infty}|=q(q-1)$ and then $| PGL_2(q)_{\infty,0}|=q-1$ .Now, since $|PGL_2(q):PGL_2(q)_{\infty}|=q+1=|\Omega|$ then $PGL_2(q)$ is acting transitively on $\Omega$ ; and because of having $|PGL_2(q))_{\infty,0}:PGL_2(q)_{\infty}|=q=|\Omega-\{\infty\}|$ therefore $PGL_2(q)$ is acting $2-$ transitively on $\Omega$ . Finally, it was concluded in the class that since $|PGL_2(q)_{\infty,0,1}|=1$ ; $|PGL_2(q)|$ is acting 3-transitively on $\Omega$ . I should confess, I can't reach to the last result and above definition is hopeless for me. My question is ""Why the group is sharply 3-transitive on $\Omega$ .

160876,Countably Compact vs Compact vs Finite Intersection Property,"There is this exercise: Show that countable compactness is equivalent to the following condition.  If ${C_n}$ is a countable collection of closed sets in S satisfying the finite intersection hypothesis, then $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty C_i$ is nonempty. Definitions: A Space S is countably compact if every infinite subset of S has a limit point in S. A space S has the finite intersection property provided that if ${C_\alpha}$ is any collection of closed sets such that any finite number of them has a nonempty intersection, then the total intersection $\bigcap_\alpha C_\alpha$ is non-empty A family of closed sets, in any space, such that any finite number of them has a nonempty intersection, will be said to satisfy the finite intersection hypothesis. Now there is also a related theorem in the book: Compactness is equivalent to the finite intersection property. Sounds to me countable compactness and compactness are pretty much the same. I am not asking for a solution to the exercise.  My question is this: What is the difference between Compactness and Countable Compactness in terms of closed Collections?  Both things sound to me like this: Given a collection of closed sets, when a finite number of them has a nonempty intersection, all of them have a nonempty intersection.

The definition for a non-degenerate form is that $q(x,y)=0\ \forall y\in E$ implies $x=0$. Now if we represent $q(x,y)$ with a matrix, so $q(x,y) =x^HAy$, why does the condition that the form be non-degenerate impose that $A$ is non-singular?

160906,A theorem in Fulton's Algebraic Curves,"In 5.23., Fulton proves the theorem that if $P$ is an ordinary flex of a plane curve $C=V(F)$, then $C$ and it's Hessian $H$ intersect with multiplicity one, that is $I(P, C \cap H) = 1$. After a bit of work, we have that it suffices to check the intersection multiplicity of the curves $f = F(X,Y,1) = y + ax^2 + bxy + cy^2+...$ and $g = 2a + 6dx + ...$ in the point $P = [0:0:1]$. Here, $a = 0$ and $d \neq 0$. What I don't see is how this implies the statement. Why do we get $\dim_k \mathcal{O}_0(\mathbb{A}^2) /(f, g) = 1$ from this?

160924,Ideal of the twisted cubic,"The twisted cubic is the image of the morphism $\phi : \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^3 , (x:y) \mapsto (x^3:x^2 y:x y^2:y^3)$, it is given by $X = V(ad-bc,b^2-ac,c^2-bd)$. Now I would like to compute $I(X)$, which equals by the Nullstellensatz the radical of the ideal $I := (ad-bc,b^2-ac,c^2-bd) \subseteq k[a,b,c,d]$. I think that that $I$ is already a radical ideal, even a prime ideal. Namely, I suspect that 
$$\phi^* : Q:=k[a,b,c,d]/I \to k[s,t] , a \mapsto s^3, b \mapsto s^2 t , c \mapsto s t^2 , d \mapsto t^3$$
is an injection. If this is true: How can we prove that? I've already tried to find a $k$-basis of the quotient, but this turned out to be a big mess. Even the representation of the quotient as a monoid algebra doesn't seem to help. Another idea is the following: A formal manipulation of generators and relations implies $Q_a \cong k[a,b]_a$. Thus it suffices to prove that $Q \to Q_a$ is injective, i.e. that $a$ is not a zero divisor.","['commutative-algebra', 'ideals', 'algebraic-geometry']"
160933,Generate Bernoulli polynomials in one integration.,"This is a follow up to one of my previous questions: Formula for integration bounds of recursively defined polynomial sequence . One aspect unfortunately wasn't answered at the time. That isn't a whine (in fact i was really pleased with the answer i got), i hold my hands up that the question wasn't specific enough - that's what this question is for. Bernoulli polynomials have a neat characterization: For $k \geq 1$ $$\displaystyle \frac{\partial }{\partial x}B_k(x)=k\cdot B_{k-1}(x)$$ $$\displaystyle \int_0^1 B_k(t) \, dt=\frac{1}{k+1}(B_{k+1}(1)-B_{k+1}(0))=0$$ Starting with $B_0(x)=1$ this generates all the polynomials. However, this is a two step process: first determine the indefinite integral $\tilde{B}_k = k\cdot \int B_k(t)\textrm{d}t$ and then determine the definite integral $\int_0^1\tilde{B}_k(t)\textrm{d}t$ to find out the integration constant that was unspecified in the indefinite integral so that the integral over $[0,1]$ is $0$. It is possible to compress this into one integration with $$B_{k+1}(x) = (k+1) \int_{c_k}^x B_k(t)\textrm{d}t$$ where the $c_k$ determine the constant of integration, but they change with each $k$. As in my other question it turns out that there are multiple possible $c_k$ for each $k$. In fact the number of possibilities is proportional to $k$ (since it involves solving a polynomial equation who's degree goes up with $k$). Is there some formula that generates one $c_k$ for each $k$? Because then $B_{k+1}(x) = (k+1) \int_{F(k)}^x B_k(t)\textrm{d}t$ solves the problem. Here is a list of the all the possible values for $c_k$ from $k=1..14$ and here are the corresponding polynomials (the possible $c_k$ are the roots of these polynomials), generated with octave, so please excuse the lack of formatting. For $k=5$ there is probably some numerical glitch (and others - also sometimes the root-finding fails to find all the roots). EDIT: It turns out that these polynomials are just the Bernoulli polynomials again. So for odd $k$ the values $c_k=0,~0.5$ and $1$ work because those are always roots of odd Bernoulli polynomials. For even $k$ it is more tricky since the roots are more complicated, but those polynomials have roots that converge to $0.25$ and $0.75$. These are the roots of $\sin(2\pi x)$ and $\cos(2\pi x)$ in the interval $[0,1]$ that a scaled version of the Bernoulli polynomials converges to. EDIT2: It is really obvious that this works, because if $r$ is a root of $B_{k+1}(x)$ then with property 1. we have: $$(k+1) \int_{r}^x B_k(t)\textrm{d}t = B_{k+1}(x)-B_{k+1}(r)=B_{k+1}(x).$$ If we integrate over $[0,x]$ this doesn't work because $B_k(0)$ isn't zero for even $k$ - in fact $B_k(0)$ are the Bernoulli numbers .","['functional-analysis', 'calculus', 'integration', 'analysis', 'bernoulli-numbers']"

What do you think are the fundamentals and the next steps? I was thinking it would be good to know how to show existence or even to know where to start to show existence of any non-linear PDE I come across. For example, I only recently found about about how people can use the inverse theorem to prove existence of a non-linear PDE. This involved Frechet derivatives which I have never seen before. And I don't fully appreciate the link between normal derivative, Gateaux derivative and Frechet derivative. So I thought how many other things I have no idea about in PDEs. And PDEs on surface are interesting (but I'm just learning differential geometry so a long wait till I look at that in detail) but it seems studied to death. So anyway what do you think is interesting in this field? I am less interested in constructing solutions to PDEs and more into existence.

160979,Sum of squares of multiplicities of differences,"It's hard to come up with a good title. Let $A$ be a set of $n$ integers, say $A=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ with $a_1<\cdots<a_n$. We consider all the positive differences $a_j-a_i$ (necessarily $i<j$). There are $n \choose 2$ pairs $(a_i,a_j)$ with $i<j$, but of course, some differences can be repeated, or in other words, have ""multiplicity"" greater than 1. For a given $A$, one way to illustrate the differences and their multiplicities is with a ""table of differences"". Here is one such table for $A=\{0,1,3,5,6\}$, and another for $A=\{1,4,7,10,13\}$. -| 0 1 3 5 6     - | 1 4 7 10 13

3|     - 2 3     7 |     - 3  6
5|       - 1     10|       -  3
6|         -     13|          - We see that if $A=\{0,1,3,5,6\}$, then the differences $1,2,3,5$ each have multiplicity 2, and the differences $4,6$ each have multiplicity 1. We also see that if $A=\{1,4,7,10,13\}$, then the differences $3,6,9,12$ have multiplicities $4,3,2,1$ respectively. My question is: What is a tight upper bound on the sum of the squares of the multiplicities? I conjecture that the answer is $1^2+2^2+3^2+\cdots+(n-1)^2$, which occurs if $A$ consists of $n$ integers in arithmetic progression (as in the second example above). At first, I thought this would be an easy consequence of the following ""lemma"": The largest multiplicity must be at most $n-1$, the second largest multiplicity must be at most $n-2$, the third largest multiplicity must be at most $n-3$, and so on. However, that ""lemma"" is false! In the first example above (in which $n=5$), the four largest multiplicities are $2,2,2,2$, which are not bounded above by $4,3,2,1$ respectively. Note that my conjectured bound grows like $n^3/3$. I'm pretty sure I can find an upper bound that grows like $2n^3/3$, but the gap between those bounds is perplexing me.","['additive-combinatorics', 'elementary-number-theory', 'combinatorics']"

The ""generating-part"" is already clear by a different theorem, but I don't see how the ""free-part"" follows from the proposition above. 2) They also state that the ""Schubert Classes form the dual bases of the intersection forms $A^m(G)\times A^{dimG-m} \rightarrow \mathrm Z$"". I guess they mean that for a fixed cyle $\sigma_a $ we get an element of the dual of the (codimension m - part of the) Chow Group (viewed as a Z-module) by defining $ \phi_a (\sigma_b) := deg(\sigma_a \sigma_b)$, and IF the $\sigma_a$'s would form a basis, than we had a dual basis that way by the proposition.

161073,"Endomorphisms, their matrix representations, and relation to similarity","This question is really several short general questions to clear up some confusions. We'll start with where I'm at: An endomorphism $\phi$ is a map from a vector space $V$ to itself. After choosing a basis $\mathcal{B}$ of $V$, one may determine a matrix to represent such an endomorphism with respect to that basis, say $[\phi]_{\mathcal{B}}$. Question 1) If given a matrix without a basis specified, could you deduce a unique endomorphism it corresponds to? (my lean is no) Question 2) In a similarity transform, say $A=SDS^{-1}$ where $D$ is diagonal, $S$ is the change of basis matrix from one basis to another. My question is, since $D$ is diagonal does that mean the matrix $D$ is the same endomorphism as $A$ with respect to the standard basis in $\mathbb{R^{n}}$. Or are we unable to determine which bases are involved if only given the matrices. Question 3) Given a matrix related to an endomorphism, is it possible to determine the basis used to represent the endomorphism. (Lean yes) Overarching Question) I am trying to understand what happens under similarity transforms. I understand we input a vector, a change of basis is applied to it, the endomorphism is applied with respect to the new basis, and then it is changed back to the old basis, but my confusion relates to the construction of the similarity matrix. If a matrix is diagonalizable, then $S$ turns out to be the eigenvectors arranged in a prescribed order. Why is this! Why do the eigenvectors for the endomorphism $\phi$ with respect to one basis act as a change of basis matrix, and what basis to they go to? This is really part of question 2. Does this send the vectors to the standard basis? Or some other basis that just happens to diagonalize the endomorphism. Thanks!","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

Almost all of the literature seems to assume a familiarity with properties of such involutions and quotients, but they don't show up at all in the books I read on elliptic curves, abelian varieties and functions fields (there is, as far as I know, very few explicit introductory literature on hyperelliptic curves).

161226,Applying equation to Markov process,"This seems as an easy question, but however I can't handle it. In the following I need this fact: If $X=(X_t)$ is a Markov process with transition semigroup $(K_t)$ and initial distribution $\mu$ then $$E\left[\prod_{k=0}^m f_k(X_{t_k})\right]=\int_E \mu (dx_0)f_0(x_0)\int_E K_{t_1}(x_0,dx_1)f_1(x_1)\int_E K_{t_2-t_1}(x_1,dx_2)\dots\int_EK_{t_n-t_{n-1}}(x_{n-1},dx_n)f_n(x_n)$$ for all measurable functions $f_i\colon E \to [0,\infty)$ and $0=t_0<t_1<\dots<t_n$ . With $P_\mu$ I denote the distribution of $X$ under $P$ on $E':=E^{[0,\infty)}$ (space of all functions from $[0,\infty)\to E$ ). With $P_x$ we denote $P_{\delta_x}$ , dirac measure at $x$ . Furthermore let $\theta_t$ be a shift operator $E'$ , i.e. $\theta_t(g)(s):=g(s+t)$ .
Now using the above fact, I want to verify this equation: $$E_\mu [(Z\circ \theta_t) V]=E_\mu[E_{Y_t}[Z]V]$$ where $Y_t$ is the coordinate process on $E'$ , i.e. $Y_t(f):=f(t)$ . $E_\mu$ should denote the expectation with respect to the measure $P_\mu$ . I want to show this fact for a special class of functions, i.e. $Z=\prod_{k=0}^m g_k(Y_{s_k})$ and $V=\prod_{i=0}^n f_i(Y_{t_i})$ with $t_n\le t$ . What I did so far: $(Z\circ \theta_t)=\prod_{k=0}^m g_k(Y_{s_k+t})$ . Writing the right hand side down, leads to: $$E_\mu\left[V \int_E \delta_{Y_t}(dx_0)g_0(x_0)\int_E K_{s_1}(x_0,dx_1)g_1(x_1)\dots \int_E K_{s_m-s_{m-1}}(x_{m-1},dx_m) g_m(x_m)\right].$$ Clearly $$\int_E \delta_{Y_t}(dx_0)g_0(x_0)\int_E K_{s_1}(x_0,dx_1)g_1(x_1)=g_0(Y_t)\int_E K_{s_1}(Y_t,dx_1)g_1(x_1).$$ So far, everything should be correct. But on the LHS, I stuck. First of all, why can I apply the fact above just to $(Z\circ\theta_t)$ ? Can I treat $V$ just like a constant? How is the correct form of the LHS?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'markov-process']"

Why do we need solvability?","I found the following problem in an old exam: If $N$ is normal in a solvable group $G$, then $N'\lhd G$. I don't understand what the assumption of solvability is for. We have $$N'\operatorname{char} N\lhd G.$$ If $\sigma$ is an inner automorphism of $G$, then $\sigma (N)=N$ by $N\lhd G.$ So $\sigma|_N$ is an automorphism of $N$. Therefore $\sigma|_N(N')=N'$ by $N'\operatorname{char} N.$ But obviously $\sigma|_N(N')=\sigma(N'),$ which ends the proof. Is this proof incorrect or does the assumption of solvability allow one not to use the notion of a characteristic subgroup? EDIT I'm sorry. Apparently, I missed part of the problem. The whole problem reads: Let $G$ be solvable and $N\lhd G.$ Show that (a) $N'\lhd G;$ (b) If, for $H\subset N,\,H\lhd G$ implies $H=\{e\}$, then $N$ is abelian. But I still don't think solvability is needed. If $H\subset N,\, H\lhd G$ implies $H=\{e\},$ then $N'=\{e\}$ by (a), and $N$ is abelian... EDIT 2 I've edited the inclusions above to be $\subset$ instead of $\subseteq$, per Arturo's answer, as this is indeed what was written in the problem. I thought the symbol meant $\subseteq$ as it often does and I changed it to make it what I thought to be more precise.",['group-theory']

161289,"Tables and histories of methods of finding $\int\sec x\,dx$?","The famously most difficult among completely elementary antiderivatives is that of the secant function . Has someone tabulated all the ways it can be done, or written a somewhat comprehensive history of them, or an account of logical connections among them? Does the feeling that this particular antiderivative can be found only by methods that are unexpected except by hindsight correspond in some way to some precisely stateable mathematical fact? Parenthesis: Look at the tangent half-angle formula in the form
$$
f(x)= \tan\left(\frac x 2 + \frac\pi4\right) = \tan x + \sec x.
$$
Differentiating both sides yields
$$
f'(x) = 2\sec^2\left(\frac x 2 + \frac\pi4\right) = \sec^2 x + \tan^2 x = (\sec x)(\sec x + \tan x) = (\sec x)f(x).
$$
So $f$ satisfies a differential equation
$$
f'(x) = (\sec x)f(x).
$$
$$
\frac{df}{f} = \sec x.
$$
Antidifferentiating both sides gives $\log|f(x)|= \text{the thing sought}$.  Is this one ""out there"" somewhere (in published source or on the web)? Later edit: Perhaps some ways of finding this antiderivative are neither ""unexpected"" (in the sense of being things that can be seen to work only by hindsight) nor applicable only to this one integral.  But a fact persists: Lots of ways of doing this that are out there in the literature do match that description.  Probably far more so than with all other elementary antiderivatives.

However, after seeing this definition of a discrete ordered ring, I'm less sure. I made that guess under the impression that the fundamental characteristic of $\mathbb{Z}$ is that every nonzero element has exactly one representation of the form $\pm (1+1+\dots+1)$, but that seems to be shared by every DOR. Presumably, this definition wouldn't exist if every instance of it was isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, so can someone give me an example of another discrete ordered ring?

161337,Is a probability measure on a compact space regular?,"Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Let $\mu$ be a Borel, probability measure on $X$. Does it automatically follow that $\mu$ is regular? That is, for all Borel $E \subset X$, must we have $$\mu(E) = \inf \mu(U) = \sup \mu(K)$$ where the infimum is taken over open $U \supset E$ and the supremum is taken over compact $K \subset E$? I know this is true when $X$ is a metric space or, more generally, when every open subset of $X$ is $\sigma$-compact. I imagine this fails in general though. I have a proposed counterexample which is a long way from being complete, but I'll put it here anyway. Let $I$ be an uncountable index set. Denote the product of $I$ many copies of the discrete space $\{0,1\}$ by $2^I$ and give it the (compact) product topology. I would like to give $2^I$ it's ""product measure"" as well, but I don't understand products of infinite families of measure spaces. Luckily, $2^I$ is, in a natural way, a compact group, so we can use the Haar measure which does what I wanted the product measure to do. Let $E$ be the set of elements of $2^I$ with countable support. Issue 1: Is $E$ Borel? I don't see why it should be... Assuming $E$ is Borel, it must have measure zero. Consider the translates $$xE = \{ y \in 2^I : y_i = x_i \text{ for all but countably many } i \in I\}$$ 
of $E$. By choosing a sequence of points $x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots \in X$ such that any two differ in uncountably many coordinates (this is possible), we see that the translates $x_1E,x_2E,x_3E,\ldots$ are disjoint. So, if $E$ had positive measure, we get that $\mu(x_1E \cup x_2E \cup \ldots) = \mu(E) + \mu(E) + \ldots = \infty$ by translation invariance of the measure. This contradicts $\mu(2^I) =1$. Now, I would like to use $E$ to contradict outer regularity. So how is it that one can find open $U \supset E$? For $F \subset I$ finite, let $U_F = \{x \in 2^I : x_i = 0 \text{ for all } i \in F\}$ (basic open set). I think essentially the only way to cover $E$ by an open set is to choose an uncountable family $F_j$ of disjoint finite subsets of $I$ and to consider $U = \bigcup_j U_{F_j}$. This covers $E$ since, if $x \in E$, then the support of $x$ is countable, so $x$ is nonzero on countably many of the $F_j$, so $x$ is zero on some particular $F_j$ and $x \in U$. Issue 2: Is it true that $U$ should have $\mu(U)=1$? For some reason I feel maybe it should. If both of the above issues are resolved, then $2^I$ is not regular since $\mu(E) = 0$ and $\inf \mu(U) = 1$.",['measure-theory']
161341,Singular points of a set of matrices,"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. We identify the space $M_{2}(k)$ of $2 \times 2$ with $\mathbb{A}^{4}(k)$  with coordinates a,b,c,d. Let $X$ be the set of all matrices $A$  in $M_{2}(k)$ such that $A^{2}=0$. Show that $X$ is isomorphic to the affine cone of the projective variety $W=V(x^{2}-yz) \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2}$ and find the singular points of $X$. Finally compute the Zariski tangent space at such point. My work: Doing the computations shows that $X=V(ad-bc,a+d)$. Now note that the affine cone of $W$ is $V(x^{2}-yz) \subseteq \mathbb{A}^{3}$. So let $f: X \rightarrow V(x^{2}-yz) \subseteq \mathbb{A}^{3}$ be given by $(x,y,z,w) \mapsto (x,-y,z)$ and let $g: V(x^{2}-yz) \subseteq \mathbb{A}^{3} \rightarrow X$ be given by $g(x,y,z)=(x,-y,z,-x)$. (Unless I did something wrong) $g$ is the inverse of $f$ so $f$ is an isomorphism. Now observe that $V(x^{2}-yz) \subseteq \mathbb{A}^{3}$ has only one singular point, namely the origin $(0,0,0)$ thus via the above isomorphism we see that $(0,0,0,0)$ is the only singular point of $X$. The part I'm not sure is how to compute the Zariski tangent space we first need to find a set of generators for $I(X)$ no? or is there an easier way? EDIT: Using software one can check that $I(X)=(xyz-x^{2}w+yzw-xw^{2})$ so the tangent space is $\mathbb{A}^{4}$ because all partials of $xyz-x^{2}w+yzw-xw^{2}$ vanish at $(0,0,0,0)$.

have that $p = P( A|E) P( E) + P( A|F) P(F ) + P( A|(E \cup F )^c) P( (E \cup F )^c)$ $P( A|E) = 1$ $P( A|F) = 0$ $P( A|(E \cup F)^c) = p$ since if neither $E$ or $F$ happen the next experiment will have $E$ before $F$ (and thus event $A$ with probability $p$ ). Thus we have
that $p = P( E) + p P( (E \cup F)^c)$ $= P( E) + p (1 − P( E \cup F))$ $= P( E) + p (1 − P( E) − P( F))$ Solving for $p$ gives $p = \frac{ P( E)}{ P( E) + P( F)}$ as we were to show. Specifically his statement since if neither $E$ or $F$ happen the next experiment will have $E$ before $F$ (and thus event $A$ with probability $p$ )","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

161523,Does an injective endomorphism of a finitely-generated free R-module have nonzero determinant?,"Alternately, let $M$ be an $n \times n$ matrix with entries in a commutative ring $R$ . If $M$ has trivial kernel, is it true that $\det(M) \neq 0$ ? This math.SE question deals with the case that $R$ is a polynomial ring over a field. There it was observed that there is a straightforward proof when $R$ is an integral domain by passing to the fraction field. In the general case I have neither a proof nor a counterexample. Here are three general observations about properties that a counterexample $M$ (trivial kernel but zero determinant) must satisfy. First, recall that the adjugate $\text{adj}(M)$ of a matrix $M$ is a matrix whose entries are integer polynomials in those of $M$ and which satisfies $$M \text{adj}(M) = \det(M).$$ If $\det(M) = 0$ and $\text{adj}(M) \neq 0$ , then some column of $\text{adj}(M)$ lies in the kernel of $M$ . Thus: If $M$ is a counterexample, then $\text{adj}(M) = 0$ . When $n = 2$ , we have $\text{adj}(M) = 0 \Rightarrow M = 0$ , so this settles the $2 \times 2$ case. Second observation: recall that by Cayley-Hamilton $p(M) = 0$ where $p$ is the characteristic polynomial of $M$ . Write this as $$M^k q(M) = 0$$ where $q$ has nonzero constant term. If $q(M) \neq 0$ , then there exists some $v \in R^n$ such that $w = q(M) v \neq 0$ , hence $M^k w = 0$ and one of the vectors $w, Mw, M^2 w,\dots, M^{k-1} w$ necessarily lies in the kernel of $M$ . Thus if $M$ is a counterexample we must have $q(M) = 0$ where $q$ has nonzero constant term. Now for every prime ideal $P$ of $R$ , consider the induced action of $M$ on $F^n$ , where $F = \overline{ \text{Frac}(R/P) }$ . Then $q(\lambda) = 0$ for every eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $M$ . Since $\det(M) = 0$ , one of these eigenvalues over $F$ is $0$ , hence it follows that $q(0) \in P$ . Since this is true for all prime ideals, $q(0)$ lies in the intersection of all the prime ideals of $R$ , hence If $M$ is a counterexample and $q$ is defined as above, then $q(0)$ is nilpotent. This settles the question for reduced rings. Now, $\text{det}(M) = 0$ implies that the constant term of $p$ is equal to zero, and $\text{adj}(M) = 0$ implies that the linear term of $p$ is equal to zero. It follows that if $M$ is a counterexample, then $M^2 \mid p(M)$ . When $n = 3$ , this implies that $$q(M) = M - \lambda$$ where $\lambda$ is nilpotent, so $M$ is nilpotent and thus must have nontrivial kernel. So this settles the $3 \times 3$ case. Third observation: if $M$ is a counterexample, then it is a counterexample over the subring of $R$ generated by the entries of $M$ , so We may assume WLOG that $R$ is finitely-generated over $\mathbb{Z}$ .","['modules', 'commutative-algebra', 'linear-algebra']"

They are contractible, and their intersection is the discrete space $\{\eta\} \sqcup \{\eta'\}$. It also follows that $\pi_1(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. Without knowing any algebraic topology, one can explicitly classify all coverings of $X$, namely this category is equialent to $\mathbb{Z}\mathsf{-Sets}$. In contrast to $S^1$, actually $X$ is homeomorphic to the spectrum of a ring: Let $R$ be the localization of $\mathbb{Z}$ at all primes $p \neq 2,3$.

In particular, let $u: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow S^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^4$ be a smooth immersion of a compact orientable two dimensional surface into the standard 3-sphere, and let $\mathcal{M}$ take the metric induced by the ambient space. Writing the principal curvatures as $k_1$ and $k_2$, we have the Gaussian curvature given by $1+k_1k_2$. I don't understand where the 1 in $K = 1+k_1k_2$ is coming from. The metric on $\mathbb{R}^4$ is the standard $g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$, and restricting it to $S^3$ yields the round metric. $S^3$ is our ambient space, and restricting to $u$ gives us our induced metric. I can think of two ways of showing this. The first would simply be to do everything out in local coordinates: for any $p \in \mathcal{M}$, we have a chart $\varphi: U \rightarrow V \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Writing $u(p) = u(\varphi^{-1}(x^1,x^2)) = (y^1,y^2,y^3,y^4)$ and then projecting stereographically $\sigma: S^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$, $\sigma(\vec{y}) = (\frac{y^1}{1-y^4},\dots,\frac{y^3}{1-y^4})$, we could recover $K$ via typical computations. Alternatively, since $2K = \mathcal{R}$, the Ricci scalar, we could compute the curvature tensor and find it that way (unless there is some shortcut? I don't have much experience with these diffgeo objects). I'm wondering if either these approaches would get me what I want, or if there is a naive reason for where the $1$ is coming from.

161812,Are Tonelli's and Fubini's theorem equivalent?,"I can derive Fubini's theorem for interated integrals of complex functions from Tonelli's theorem for iterated integrals for unsigned functions.  I was wondering whether there is a way to go backwards.  I do not think so, because Fubini's theorem assumes the integrals are finite, whereas Tonelli's theorem allows the value of the integral to be $+\infty$. But maybe we can use a limiting argument? This is where I am not clear. So: is it possible to derive Tonelli's theorem from Fubini's theorem?  If so, I would appreciate a proof (or a outline of a proof).","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
161850,Doubt on displacement of a parabola(Again),"In another exercise is given:
Find the parabola which is a displacement of $y = 2x^2 - 3x + 4$ which passes though the point $(2, -1)$ and has $x = 1$ as its symmetry axis. I've reduced the based equation to the form: $y = 2(x - \frac{3}{4})^2 + \frac{23}{8}$, so the vertex is $(\frac{3}{4}, \frac{23}{8})$. As the displaced equation has its symmetry axes on $x = 1$ it's known that its vertex is $(1, x)$ what can I do more to find the $y$ of the displaced equation ? Thanks in advance. EDIT: Corrected  the typo",['algebra-precalculus']
161857,Notation for powers of trigonometric functions [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : $\arcsin$ written as $\sin^{-1}(x)$ (1 answer) Closed last year . Possible Duplicate: $\arcsin$ written as $\sin^{-1}(x)$ When I learnt the trig identity $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta \equiv 1$, I learnt that $\sin^2\theta = (\sin\theta)^2$. So why isn't $\sin^{-1}\theta = (\sin\theta)^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{\sin\theta}$? Because $\csc\theta = \dfrac{1}{\sin\theta} $, but $\csc\theta \ne \sin^{-1}\theta$ How can these two same notations, just with different numbers, mean different things?","['notation', 'trigonometry']"

161878,Unimodal marginals imply the following on the joint distribution?,"Suppose $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ are each unimodal random variables with mode around zero. In particular, for each $i$, $X_i=X_i'-X'$ where $X'_i$ and $X'$ are i.i.d. unimodal random ($X_i'$ and $X_j'$ are ind. as well) variables so that $X_i$ is indeed unimodal. Is it the case that joint distribution of $X_i$ has the form, say $F(\cdot)$ satisfies the following: Given $x_2,\ldots,x_n$ $F(u,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ is convex for $u\in (-\infty,a)$  and concave for $u \in (a,\infty)$. In particular, the conditional (on truncating the other variables) distribution is unimodal. If so, how would one go about proving such a claim? Thanks in advance","['statistics', 'probability']"
