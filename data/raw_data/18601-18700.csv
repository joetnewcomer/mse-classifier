154391,"Locally lipschitz on $[a,b]$ implies lipschitz","Suppose a function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is locally Lipschitz.  Prove that $f$ is Lipschitz on $[a,b]$ . Here is what I have so far: Let $[a, b]$ be some closed, bounded interval. Since f is locally Lipschitz, for each $x\in[a; b]$ , we may find some $U_x$ and some $M_x$ such that $|f(y)-f(z)| < M|x-y|$ .  Let $\mathcal{U}$ denote the collection of all such open neighborhoods $U_x$ . Then $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $[a, b]$ . By the Heine-Borel Theorem, $[a, b]$ is compact, so $\mathcal{U}$ has a finite subcover, $\mathcal{V}$ . Label the members of $\mathcal{V}$ as $U_{x_1}, U_{x_2},\ldots,U_{x_n}$ . Then $[a, b]$ and for each $U_{x_k}$ , we associate a corresponding $M_{x_k}$ such
that if $y, z\in U_{x_k}$ , then $|f(y)-f(z)|< M_{x_k}|y-z|$ .  Let $M = \max\{M_{x_1},\ldots,M_{x_n}\}$ .  Let $y$ and $z$ be some points in $[a, b]$ with $z < y$ .

154395,Connections of Geometric Group Theory with other areas of mathematics.,"I'm a master's student in the Turin University. At the end of my studies, I have to write a master thesis. My main interest is geometric group theory, but it is not a research area of the Turin's mathematical department. My professors in algebra and geometry are principally interested in algebraic geometry, commutative algebra or in Lie groups. My analysis professors are interested mainly in PDE and differential forms. So neither the theory of non-positive curved spaces, nor measure group theory seems to be a feasible alternative. Since I want to do a PhD – not in Turin – I don't want to do a thesis too distant from my main interest. What I want to know is then if you know some topics of geometric group theory (or other similar theories) that are sufficiently connected with algebraic geometry (for example, with riemannian surfaces) or with Lie Groups and can be explored by a master student. I haven't had yet time to explore deeply the main book on the subject – de la Harpe, Geoghegan, Bridson-Haefliger, Bowditch, Serre, Farb(on mapping class groups). Anyway, I suppose the theory presented in the Farb's book is the one that has more connections with the topics I listed before, or I'm wrong?","['lie-groups', 'algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request', 'geometric-group-theory']"

154420,Euler's summation by parts formula,"I'm beginning analytic number theory and I see this formula in Apostol's book : If $f$ has a continuous derivative $f'$ on the interval $[y,x]$, where $0 < y < x$, then 
$$
\sum_{y < n \le x} f(n) = \int_y^x f(t) \, dt + \int_y^x (t-[t]) f'(t) \, dt + f(x) ([x] - x) - f(y) ([y]-y).
$$
The proof in Apostol's can be followed easily if one uses Riemann Integration. But since I meet with number theorists often I see more this kind of notation :
$$
\sum_{y < n \le x} f(n) = \int_y^x f(t) d[t] = \text{something here I don't recall} - \int_y^x [t]f'(t) dt
$$
because for some reason they can ""integrate $d[t]$ and it gives $[t]$"", which I don't understand, and I also don't really understand precisely what $d[t]$ stands for. I have done a measure theory course ; what I'm saying is that I don't understand all the details ; I understand that they ""integrate by parts with the measure $d[t]$"" which makes the proof quite simpler, but I don't understand the assumptions they make and how the details work out. I think that $d[t]$ could be a measure such that for $E \subseteq \mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C$, $d[t](E) = | \mathbb N \cap E |$, but I'm not sure. Here's what I'm looking for : I don't want an intuitive point of view with plots or summations ; I want a formal proof from the viewpoint of a measure theorist, with details. Is there anyway this can be made clear? The reason why I want this is because I don't have much faith in the ""integration by parts with $d[t]$"" version of the proof, but number theorists seem to love it so much and they all sketch it ; I never managed to do it myself formally, even though I did a measure theory course.

154426,A question about modular curves and base change,"Let $X$ be a smooth projective geometrically connected curve over a number field $K$. Suppose that the curve $X\times_{K,\sigma} \mathbf{C}$ is a modular curve for some $\sigma:K\to \mathbf{C}$. Can we conclude that $X\times_{K,\tau} \mathbf{C}$ is a modular curve for ALL $\tau:K\to \mathbf{C}$? I'm asking this question out of pure curiosity. I see no reason why all base changes of $X$ to $\mathbf{C}$ should be modular provided one of them is. Then again, I wouldn't know how to construct a counter example.

154448,Cauchy-Goursat with triangle contour,"The Cauchy-Goursat theorem for a triangle contour states the following: Let $\triangle=\triangle(a,b,c)$ be a triangle in an open set $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C},p\in \Omega,f:\Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ continuous and f analytical on $\Omega \setminus \{p\}$. Then: $\int\limits_{\partial\triangle}f(z)dz=0$ , where $\partial\triangle$ means on and inside the triangle $\triangle$. The proof then distinguishes a few cases around $p$... but why?: 1) $p \notin \triangle$ 2) $p=a$ 3) $p \in \triangle$ randomly. I do understand the proof, but I don't understand what's the purposes of $p$. Why do we even mention it? What's the thought behind this? Some books don't mention it. Edit: Proof Case 1: $ p\not\subset\triangle$. Let $a',\ b',\ c'$ be the midpoints of the segments $[b,\ c],\ [c,\ a],\ [a,\ b]$. We denote with $\triangle^{j}(j=1,2,3,4)$ the triangles $(a,\ c',\ b'),\ (b,\ a',\ c'),\ (c,\ b',\ a'),\ (a',\ b',\ c')$. Let $I =\displaystyle \int_{\partial\triangle}f(z)dz$. We now have:
$$
I\ =\sum_{j=1}^{4}\int_{\partial\triangle^{j}}f(z)\mathrm{d}z
$$
There is a $j_{0}\in\{1,2,3,4\}$ so that
$$
\left|\int_{\partial\triangle^{j_{0}}}f(z)\mathrm{d}z\right|\geq\frac{|I|}{4}
$$
Let $\triangle_{1}:=\triangle^{j_{0}}$. The same construction with $\triangle_{1}$ instead of $\triangle$ yields a triangle $\triangle_{2}$, etc. By induction we get a sequence $(\triangle_{n})$ of triangles with $\triangle\supseteq\triangle_{1}\supseteq\triangle_{2}\supseteq\ldots$, so that $|I| \displaystyle \leq 4^{n}\left|\int_{\partial\triangle_{n}}f(z)\mathrm{d}z\right|,\ (n\in \mathbb{N})$ Further we have the length $L(\partial\triangle_{n})=2^{-n}L(\partial\triangle)$ and $\displaystyle \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}$ diam $(\triangle_{n})=0$ because diam $(\triangle_{n})\leq L(\partial\triangle_{n})$. It follows that (Cantor)
$$
\triangle \bigcap_{n=1}\triangle_{n}=\{z_{0}\}.
$$
Because $f$  is in $z_{0}$  complex differentiable, there exists for $\varepsilon>0$ a $r>0$ with
$$
|f(z)-f(z_{0})-f'(z_{0})(z-z_{0})|\leq \varepsilon|z-z_{0}|\ (z\in C(z_{0},\ r)\subseteq\Omega)
$$
and there is a $n\in \mathbb{N}$ mit $\triangle_{n}\subseteq C(z_{0},\ r)$. For this $n$ we have:
$$
|z-z_{0}|\leq 2^{-n}L(\partial\triangle)\ (z\in\triangle_{n})
$$
Furthermore:
$$
\int_{\partial\triangle_{n}}f(z)\mathrm{d}z=\int_{\partial\triangle_{n}}f(z)-f(z_{0})-f'(z_{0})(z-z_{0})\mathrm{d}z
$$ We have:
$$
\left|\int_{\partial\triangle_{n}}f(z)\mathrm{d}z\right|\leq \varepsilon\cdot(2^{-n}L(\partial\triangle))^{2}
$$
and thus
$$
|I|\leq 4^{n}\left|\int_{\partial\triangle_{n}}f(z)\mathrm{d}z\right|\leq \varepsilon(L(\partial\triangle))^{2}
$$
Because $\varepsilon>0$ was chosen arbitrarly,  $I =0$ follows. $\color{red}{\text{In my point of view, we are now completely done with the proof. But the proof continues, see below}}$ Case 2: Now, let $p$ be a vertex of $\triangle$, for instance let $p=a$. If  $a,\ b,\ c$ lie on the same line, then we have trivially $I=0$. If not, we choose $x\in[a,\ b],y\in[a,\ c]$ near $a$. Then we have:
$$
\displaystyle \int_{\partial\triangle}f(z)\mathrm{d}z=\int_{\partial\triangle(a,x,y)}f(z)\mathrm{d}z+\int_{\partial\triangle(x,b,y)}f(z)\mathrm{d}z+\int_{\partial\triangle(b,c,y)}f(z)\mathrm{d}z
$$
$$
=\int_{\partial\triangle(a,x,y)}f(z)dz.
$$
Because we can make $L(\partial\triangle(a,x,\ y))$ arbitrarily small, $I =0$ follows. Case 3:
If $ p\in\triangle$ arbitrarily, $I =0$ follows from case 2: $$
\displaystyle I\ =\int_{\partial\triangle(a,b,p)}f(z)\mathrm{d}z+\int_{\partial\triangle(b,c,p)}f(z)\mathrm{d}z+\int_{\partial\triangle(c,a,p)}f(z)\mathrm{d}z=0

My guess is that it's like this: $$7(-(e^{-x-1})/e^{-x})$$ or just simply $-7$. I'm specifically unsure with how to find the derivative of $5xe^{-x}$. I know that $e^x$'s derivative is simply $e^x(1)$ because the derivative of $x = 1$ so when I find the derivative of $e^{-x}$ I'd expect it to be $-1e^x$ and in my case $-5xe^{-x}$,"['calculus', 'derivatives']"
154486,Power series expansion for analytic functions,"Theorem Let $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be open and $f\in H(\Omega)$ ($f$ analytic on $\Omega$). If $ C(z_{0},R)\subseteq\Omega$ (where $C(z_0,R)$ is the circle with origin $z_0$ and radius $R$), then we can represent $f$ on $C(z_{0},R)$ as a power series with convergence radius $\geq R$. Proof Let $0<r<R$ and $\gamma:[0,2\pi]\rightarrow\Omega$ be the path $\gamma(t)=z_{0}+re^{it}$. Because $C(z_{0},R)$ is convex and $\gamma$ is in this circle, we have the following from the Cauchy integral formula:

Does everyone like the following (well enough)? Assertion : $$\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{x^{x^x}}{x} = 1$$ Proof : We pass to the log of the limit. $$\log\left(\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{x^{x^x}}{x}\right) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \log\left(\frac{x^{x^x}}{x}\right) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\log(x)}{\frac{1}{x^x - 1}}$$ We use L'Hospital's rule, and rearrange: $$\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\log(x)}{\frac{1}{x^x - 1}} = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{-x^x(\log(x) + 1)}{(x^x - 1)^2}} = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{- (x^x - 1)^2}{x^{x}(x\log(x) + x)} = \left( \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{-(x^x - 1)}{x^x} \right) \left( \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{(x^x - 1)}{x\log(x) + x} \right) $$ provided that both of these last limits exist; but (again using L'Hospital in the 2nd limit) we see that $$\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{-(x^x - 1)}{x^x} = \frac{0}{1} = 0,$$ $$\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{(x^x - 1)}{x\log(x) + x} = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{x^x(\log(x)+1)}{(1+ \log(x)) + (1)} = \left( \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{x^x(\log(x)+2)}{( \log(x)) + 2)} - \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{x^x}{(\log(x)) + 2)} \right) = 1,$$ and therefore $\displaystyle\log\left(\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{x^{x^x}}{x}\right) = 0$. Evaluating both sides by $\exp(x)$ therefore shows that $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{x^{x^x}}{x} = 1$.",['calculus']

154514,Arzelà - Ascoli Theorem for an arbitrary family of functions,"I have just completed an exercise in Abott's Understanding analysis concerning the Arzelà - Ascoli theorem for functions on $\Bbb{R}$. The statement of the exercise is as follows: Let $\{f_n\}$ be an equicontinuous family of functions on $[0,1]$ that is uniformly bounded on the same interval, viz. there exists a constant $M$ such that $|f_n(x)| \leq M$ for all $n \in \Bbb{N}$ and for all $x \in [0,1]$. Then $\{f_n\}$ has a uniformly convergent subsequence. Now this exercise generalises nicely to the following statement for functions on an arbitrary compact metric space nicely, namely: Let $(X,d)$ be a compact metric space and $C(X;\Bbb{R}^n)$ the space of all continuous functions from $X$ to $\Bbb{R}^n$ with the sup metric derived from $d$. If $\{f_n\}$ is an equicontinuous and uniformly bounded family on $C(X;\Bbb{R}^n)$  then $\{f_n\}$ has a uniformly convergent subsequence. This generalises directly from the exercise in Abbott because a compact metric space $X$ is separable (has a countable dense subset $E$) and everything else follows through from the proof for functions on $[0,1]$. Now I am trying to apply the statement of the Arzelà - Ascoli theorem above for metric spaces to prove the following problem below: Let $(X,d)$ bee a compact metric space and let $C(X;\Bbb{R}^n)$ be the space of all continuous functions from $X$ to $\Bbb{R}^n$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be any subfamily of $C(X;\Bbb{R}^n)$ which is closed, uniformly bounded and uniformly equicontinuous. Then $\mathcal{F}$ is compact in the sup metric on $C(X;\Bbb{R}^n)$ derived from $d$. It seems to me that as long as I can choose a countable subset $\{g_n\}$ of $\mathcal{F}$, the problem should be done by the Arzelà - Ascoli theorem. This is because we already know that $\{g_n\}$ is uniformly bounded and uniformly equicontinuous. Why do we need the hypothesis that $\mathcal{F}$ is closed? Thanks.","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

154527,Really simple combinatorics question - Composition of n number strings,"I'm doing a bit of revision and want to make sure I'm doing these two questions correctly.

I think this just an unordered selection of 5 numbers from 10 options with repetition allowed. So $ {{10+5-1} \choose {5}} = { 14 \choose 5} = 2002$ b) What is the largest number of 5-digit number that can be produced so that no two are equivalent and none on the digits 1, 3, 7 appear more than once.

Second, my question is if there exists a measurable indicator function that cannot be approximated in this way, and if so, how to show/find it. Attempt at solution: Resnick offer's a helpful hint that I believe makes the first part simple enough. Let $f(x) = 1_{(a,b]}$ as stated. If I define a sequence of measurable functions, $f_n$ such that:
$f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & x \leq a, x \geq b + \frac1n \\

Please comment on any deficiencies. Secondary question How is this result changed in order to find measurable functions that cannot be approximated as such.

154547,A (non-artificial) example of a ring without maximal ideals,"As a brief overview of the below, I am asking for: An example of a ring with no maximal ideals that is not a zero ring. A proof (or counterexample) that $R:=C_0(\mathbb{R})/C_c(\mathbb{R})$ is a ring with no maximal ideals. A homework question in my algebra class earlier this year asked to exhibit a ring (necessarily without identity) without any maximal (proper) ideals. For solutions to this, it suffices to exhibit an abelian group $(G,+)$ without maximal (proper) subgroups. For, given such a group, define multiplication to be constantly zero. In this case, $G$ becomes a zero ring without maximal ideals (because ideals correspond to subgroups). It is not particularly difficult to construct examples of the above. For example, consider $(\mathbb{Q},+)$. Another interesting example is $P=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\mid \exists n\in\mathbb{N}, z^{p^n}=1\}$ with standard complex number multiplication as ""addition"" (that is, as the abelian group operation). However, any example constructed in this manner is a zero ring, and as such seems ""artificial,"" which I admit, is not a rigorous term. I would like to find a somewhat less artificial example of a ring without maximal ideals. For a definition of ""less artificial,"" let us start with ""not a zero ring."" I have a candidate in mind, but I am having trouble explicitly proving that it has no maximal ideals. Let $C_0(\mathbb{R})$ denote the ring of continuous real-valued function on $\mathbb{R}$ vanishing at infinity. Let $C_c(\mathbb{R})$ denote the (two-sided) ideal of compactly supported functions. I believe that the ring $R:=C_0(\mathbb{R})/C_c(\mathbb{R})$ contains no maximal ideals, but I am having trouble showing it. My intuition for this problem is as follows. Given a function $f\in C_0(\mathbb{R})$, $f(x)$ approaches zero at some ""rate"" as $x\to\pm\infty$ (possibly different based on $\pm$). Furthermore, for any given rate, we can find a function with a larger rate, in the sense that we can find a $g\in C_0(\mathbb{R})$ such that $f(x)=o(g(x))$ ($f$ is little-$o$ of $g$). Now, even if $f$ is non-vanishing, there is no $h\in C_0(\mathbb{R})$ such that $fh=g$, for any $h$ could not vanish at infinity. Thus the principal ideal generated by $f$ does not contain $g$. By iterating this process we could construct a strictly ascending chain of principal ideals. Now, the idea is that the ring $R$ consists of these ""rates"" as described above. I know that this is not precise, or necessarily even correct. But it's my intuition. The previous paragraph shows that we can find an ascending chain of ""rates,"" but a lot of work still needs to be done. If anyone can clean this up, it would be much appreciated.","['examples-counterexamples', 'ring-theory', 'maximal-and-prime-ideals', 'abstract-algebra', 'asymptotics']"

Suppose $C_1=C(u_1)\simeq \langle u_1\rangle\times S_3$ and $C_2=C(u_2)$ be a dihedral group of order $8$. The eventual result is that $G\simeq S_5$. Also, $C(u)$ denotes the centralizer of $u$ in $G$. I'm trying to deduce that $|S_2|=0$ or $4$, where $S_i$ is the set of pairs $(x,y)$ with $x$ conjugate to $u_1$, $y$ conjugate to $u_2$, and $(xy)^n=u_i$ for some $n$, and that $C_2$ then has a noncyclic subgroup $V$ such that all involutions in $V$ are conjugate to $u_2$ in $G$. This is part of exercise 10 of page 83, Jacobson's Basic Algebra I. Thanks for any help. My sparse thoughts: I know a few facts I think are useful (proofs are linked in the numbers to the left hand side): 1. If $c_i=|C(u_i)|$ and $s_i=|S_i|$, then $|G|=c_1s_2+c_2s_1$. 2. $C_2$ is a Sylow $2$-subgroup, and I observe from this that one can assume $u_1\in C_2$ by taking a conjugate. 3. There are $3$ classes of involutions in $C_2$, and if $x$ is an involution distinct from $u_2$, then $x$ is conjugate to $xu_2$ in $C_2$. I'm lost on how to use this info on the involutions in $C_2$ to count the size of $S_2$. Identifying $C_2$ with $D_8=\langle r,s\mid r^4=s^2=1,\; sr=r^3s\rangle$ and $r^2$ with $u_2$, I know that the two noncyclic subgroups of order $4$ are $\{1,s,r^2,r^2s\}$ and $\{1,rs,r^2,r^3s\}$. I consider the intersection $C:=C_1\cap C_2$. This is a subgroup with order dividing $8$ and $12$, but since I already know $1,u_1,u_2\in C$, then $|C|=4$. I think this might be the desired subgroup $V$.

The functions in (a)-(e) are not defined on some values. So I suspect, that these are the first candidates for singularities. For instance in (a), it would be 0. In (b), it would be 0 and 2. Question: Could there be any other points where these functions are not analytic? Let's call our isolated singularity $a$. Furthermore I know that we have 3 types of singularities: 1) removable This would be the case when $f$ is bounded on the disk $D(a,r)$ for some $r>0$. 2) pole There is $c_1, ... , c_m \in \mathbb{C},\ m\in\mathbb{N}$ with $c_m \neq 0$, so that: $$f(z)-\sum\limits_{k=1}^m c_k\cdot\frac{1}{(z-a)^k},\ z \in \Omega \backslash \{a\})$$ has a removable singularity in $a$, then we call $a$ a pole. We also know that in this case: $|f(z)|\rightarrow \infty$ when $z\rightarrow a$. 3) essential If the disk $D(a,r) \subseteq \Omega$, then $f(D(a,r)\backslash\{a\})$ is dense in $\mathbb{C}$ and we call $a$ essential singularity.

Let $ D(a,\ r)\subseteq\Omega$ be a disk with $|f(z)|\leq|f(a)|$ for all $z\in D(a,\ r)$ ($a$ is therefore a local maximum for $f$). Then we have for every $\rho\in(0,\ r)$ with $\gamma(t)=a+\rho e^{it} \ (t\ \in[0,2\pi])$:
$$
|f(a)|=\frac{1}{2\pi}\left|\int_{\gamma}\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi-a}\mathrm{d}\xi\right|\ \leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}|f(a+\rho e^{it})|\mathrm{d}t\ \leq|f(a)| \ \ \ (1)
$$ $\color{green}{\text{I understand the inequality in (1), but what is the point of showing: } |f(a)|\leq|f(a)|?}$
$\color{green}{\text{Why is this mentioned?}}$ From $|f(a+\rho e^{it})|\leq|f(a)$ for $t \in[0,2\pi]$ and $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}|f(a+\rho e^{it})|\mathrm{d}t =|f(a)|$ (2) we have:

|f(a+\rho e^{it})|=|f(a)|\ (t\ \in[0,2\pi]).\ \ \ (3)
$$ $\color{green}{\text{What is the role of the integral in (2), in showing the equality (3)?}}$ Therefore we have:
$$
|f(z)|=|f(a)|\ (z\in D(a,r))\ (*)

If $f$ would not be constant, then (because $\Omega$ is a region) also $f:D(a, r)\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ would not be constant and $f(D(a,\ r))$ would be open, which is a contradiction to $(*)$.

154776,"Proof of 2 Matrix identities (Traces, Logs, Determinants)","I am working through a derivation in someone's thesis at the moment to understand an important result, but I am more than a bit rusty on matrices. Could anyone give me some tips on these identities? They are stated without proof and I'm having a hard time finding a derivation online. Below, X is a matrix and E is a scalar, and X is a function of E. 1) $Tr(X' X^{-1}) = \frac{d}{dE} Tr(ln(X))$ When I first saw this I thought it would be the same as treating X as a scalar, then by the definition of the ln function the above would be true. Is the fact that there is a trace and that X is a matrix important in the derivation? He does mention that """" $Tr(log X)' = Tr[X' X] = Tr[X X']$ """" but I think this was probably a typo, since an expression of the form $Tr[X' X]$ does not appear in his calculation. 2) $Tr(ln(X)) = ln(det(X))$ This one I am a bit stuck on, I would guess that it has something to do with the definitions of the trace and determinant but not sure where to go from there. I haven't done anything with matrices in about 3 years, and I'm a physicist, so keep it basic :) EDIT OK here is my working for proof 1 using Robert's guide below: $$ X' = \frac{d}{dE} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{L^n}{n!} $$
Using the chain rule, $$ X' = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n L' L^{n-1}}{n!} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{L' L^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{L' L^{n-1}}{n!}$$
Here is the bit I don't quite follow, regarding the introduction of the dummy j which seems to cancel later on in the calculation without being used.
$$ \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{L' L^j L^{n-1 - j}}{n!} $$
Now using this expression for X':
$$ X' X^{-1} = X' e^{-L} = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{L' L^j L^{n-1 - j}}{n!} e^{-L} $$
Here is where I find a problem now, since 
$$ \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{L^{n-1}}{n!}) L' e^{-L} $$
Now my part in the brackets in that last expression isn't $e^L$ so doesn't cancel nicely. I am pretty sure I am missing something with commutativity and when you introduced the sum over j!?

If $f$ is continuously differentiable, then, for each $x\in U$, defining $g_x:=f-f'(x)$ (then $g_x'(y)=f'(y)-f'(x)$) and applying the Mean Value Theorem, using the continuity for $f'$, and for adequate closed ball $B=\bar B(x;\delta)\subset U$ such that $\|f'(a)-f'(b)\|<\epsilon/2$ if $a,b\in B(x;2\delta)\subset U$, and for any $h,k\in B,h\ne k$, we have

Spectral triples are a generalization of spin$^c$ manifolds and real spectral triples of spin manifolds.

155138,Generalizations for Tietze's extension theorem.,"Tietze's extension theorem says: ''If $A$ is a closed subset of $X$ a normal space, and $f:A\to \mathbb{R}$ continuous, then we can extend $f$ to a continuous function $g:X\to \mathbb{R}$."" I know that it can be generalized by changing $\mathbb{R}$ to closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. But, can we find further generalizations by changing $\mathbb{R}$ to a more general space $Y$. To be precise, I'm looking for generalizations for an arbitrary polish space $Y$, and if it's worth it, $X$ is a zero dimensional polish space. The thing is, I want continuous functions, but I really only care how they behave in a closed set. For any particular case, I can use a nice Cantor scheme and get the function, but I don't want to keep repeating me.","['general-topology', 'descriptive-set-theory']"

155156,Is it generally accepted that if you throw a dart at a number line you will NEVER hit a rational number?,"In the book ""Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea"", author Charles Seife claims that a dart thrown at the real number line would never hit a rational number. He doesn't say that it's only ""unlikely"" or that the probability approaches zero or anything like that. He says that it will never happen because the irrationals take up all the space on the number line and the rationals take up no space. This idea almost makes sense to me, but I can't wrap my head around why it should be impossible to get really lucky and hit, say, 0, dead on. Presumably we're talking about a magic super sharp dart that makes contact with the number line in exactly one point. Why couldn't that point be a rational? A point takes up no space, but it almost sounds like he's saying the points don't even exist somehow. Does anybody else buy this? I found one academic paper online which ridiculed the comment, but offered no explanation. Here's the original quote: ""How big are the rational numbers? They take up no space at all. It's a tough concept to swallow, but it's true. Even though there are rational numbers everywhere on the number line, they take up no space at all. If we were to throw a dart at the number line, it would never hit a rational number. Never. And though the rationals are tiny, the irrationals aren't, since we can't make a seating chart and cover them one by one; there will always be uncovered irrationals left over. Kronecker hated the irrationals, but they take up all the space in the number line. The infinity of the rationals is nothing more than a zero.""","['infinity', 'probability']"

155173,How to induce a connection on a submanifold?,"Suppose an affine connection is given on a smooth manifold $M$ and let $N\subset M$ be an embedded submanifold. Is there a canonical way of defining an induced connection on $N$? In classical differential geometry of smooth surfaces in Euclidean 3-space, the corresponding construction is that of covariant derivative (cfr. Do Carmo, Differential geometry of curves and surfaces §4-4). The covariant derivative of a vector field along a curve on the surface is defined as the orthogonal projection of the ordinary Euclidean derivative onto the plane tangent to the surfaces. I wonder how (and if) this can be ported to the language of connections. Wikipedia's entry does something like that by means of the Riemannian structure: I wonder if this extra structure is really necessary.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

What I find strange is that the direct proof doesn't seem to require that $\mathscr{F}$ is a sheaf, while Mayer-Vitories argument uses the fact that both $\mathscr{F},\mathscr{G}$ are sheaves. Am I missing something, or is it true in general that only $\mathscr{G}$ needs to be a sheaf?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

 \frac{1}{2n}\right)$$ by considering the lower Riemann sum of $f$ where $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ over $[1, 2]$ I was confused looking at the equality to begin with, since taking  $n \rightarrow \infty$ for all of those terms would become $0$ right? Anyway, I attempted it regardless. $$\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{n}(f(1 + \frac{k}{n}))$$ $$= \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{n}(\frac{1}{1+ \frac{k}{n}})$$ $$=\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{n + k} = $$ the sum from the question? I wasn't sure what to do from here.

Question: I have difficulties swallowing the implication that $\nabla_1 - \nabla_2 \in \Omega^1 (\text{End } V)$. Of course, $\Omega^1 (\text{End } V) = \Gamma (T^\ast M \otimes \text{End } V)$, so this is saying that $\nabla_1 - \nabla_2$ is an endomorphism-valued 1-form. Also, given any section $s \in \Omega^0 (V)$, the difference $(\nabla_1 - \nabla_2) s$ at any point $m \in M$ is completely determined by the value $s(m)$, i.e. the operator $(\nabla_1 - \nabla_2) |_m$ is an endomorphism of the fiber $V|_m$, but I don't see how this is relevant, yet...","['vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

155254,Four turtles/bugs puzzle,"I was reading about the the four turtles/bugs math puzzle Four bugs are at the four corners of a square of side length D. They start walking at constant speed in an anticlockwise direction at all times directly towards the bug ahead of them. How far does each bug walk before they meet with each other? and the a-ha answer given is that the turtles are always in the shape of a square, and since each one is always walking perpendicular to the direction of his pursuer's approach, he neither hinders nor helps the pursuer in reaching him. Therefore the time to the center is the same as the time it takes one turtle to walk across a side of the square. Since each creature is running directly to its target, the paths of a chaser and its chasee are always at right angles. That is, the distance between the chaser and its chasee depends only on the movement of the chaser, not its chasee. Therefore, the distance that the chaser runs is the same as if the chasee did not run at all. Could you please explain how this happens?","['geometry', 'puzzle']"
