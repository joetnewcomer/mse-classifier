352860,Calculating $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \sin{\frac{1}{n}}$ by the squeeze theorem,"I've been having a bit of trouble with a tutorial question from my 3rd year Foundations of Calculus course. It asks to find $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \sin{\frac{1}{n}}$ using the pinching theorem. I know the limit must be 0, but I'm not quite sure how to get there using the theorem. I've got to $\frac{-1}{n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sin{\frac{1}{n}} \leq \frac{1}{n}$ but can't see a clear way to go from there to just $\sin{\frac{1}{n}}$ .

352872,Question about pointwise canonically weakly pseudocompact space.,"A point $x$ of a space $X$ is said to be a point of canonical weak pseudocompactness if the following condition is satisfied: For every canonical open subset $U$ of $X$ such that $x\in\overline{U}$, there exists a sequence 
  $\{A_n:n\in\omega\}$ of subsets of $U$ such that $x\in\overline{A_n}$, for each $n\in \omega$, and for every 
  indexed family $\xi=\{O_n:n\in\omega\}$ of open subsets of $X$ satisfying $O_n\cap A_n\neq\varnothing$
  for all $n\in\omega$, the family $\xi$ has an accumulation point in $X$. A space $X$ is pointwise canonically weakly pseudocompact if each point of $X$ is a 
point of canonical weak pseudocompactness. How can we show that Every compact topological group is a pointwise canonically weakly pseudocompact space? Is it true that every dyadic compactum is a pointwise canonically weakly pseudocompact space? If 2 is true then 1 has also proven since Every compact topological 
group $G$ is a dyadic compactum. An open subset $U$ of a space $X$ is said to be canonical open in $X$ if $U$ is the 
interior of its closure. I added a few references that I hope will clarify the issue; 1 . A.V. Arkhangel'skii and M. Tkachenko, Topological Groups and Related Structures , p359. 2 . A.V.

352882,Proving Bishop's Theorem using Krein-Milman Theorem,"I am studying the proof of Bishop's theorem (generalization of Stone-Weierstrass) in Rudin's Functional Analysis 2nd edition.

353019,How long does it take for a given number of Minecraft sugar cane plants to grow to full size?,"In Minecraft , the growth of sugar cane plants is governed by random events.  On each game tick (1/20th of a second), each sugar cane plant has a certain probability of advancing to the next stage of growth. The random event must occur 30 times for the plant to grow from 1-block tall to 3-blocks tall. My goal is to calculate the average amount of time required for a given number of sugar cane plants to all grow completely, if all of the plants are in the same field and planted simultaneously. Since many users at Math.SE might not know much about Minecraft sugar cane, I'm going to reformulate the problem in a more general way: We have a given number $N$ of weighted coins, each with the same probability $P$ of landing on heads.  Each coin is flipped until it lands on heads a given minimum $M$ number of times, and we count the number of flips required by each coin.  The time T is given by the number of flips required by the coin that took the most flips (it is the maximum out of the data set). What is the average value of $T$? When $N = 1$, it is clear that $T \approx M/P$.  When $P = 0.5$ (a fair coin) and $M = 3$, it will take an average of six flips for the coin to land on heads three times. In the case of sugar cane, my internet research tells me that $P = 3/4096$ and $M = 30$. This means that it takes an average of $40960$ game ticks for a single plant to grow completely. When $N > 1$, I don't know exactly how to approach the problem.  I've done some computer simulations, and by trying to fit curves to the data I found that it seems to follow this pattern: 
$$T \approx f(M,P) \times \log(N) + M/P$$ The formula for $f(M,P)$ is unknown. Edit: For clarification, $N$ represents the number of sugar cane plants in the field.",['probability']

353155,Residue Formula application,"Using the Residue formula, I've been trying to prove $$\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1}{a^2\cos^2\theta+b^2\sin^2\theta}\,d\theta=\frac{2\pi}{ab},\quad\quad a,b\in\Bbb R.$$First, it seems like the formula should be wrong (unless perhaps we assume $a,b\in\Bbb R^+$) since the right-hand side can be negative, but the integrand on the left is always non-negative. Currently I'm assuming the additional requirement $a,b>0$. With that said, to approach it, I use Euler's formulas on the trig. functions in the denominator and make a change of variables, $$z=e^{i\theta},\quad \frac{1}{iz}\,dz=d\theta.$$Now, if I have calculated correctly, the integral reduces to $$\int_{|z|=1}\frac{1}{iz}\cdot\frac{1}{\frac{a^2}{4}\left(z+z^{-1}\right)^2-\frac{b^2}{4}\left(z-z^{-1}\right)^2}\,dz.$$We can factor $z^{-2}$ from the right-side denominator to get $$\int_{|z|=1}\frac{z}{i}\cdot\frac{1}{\frac{a^2}{4}\left(z^2+1\right)^2-\frac{b^2}{4}\left(z^2-1\right)^2}\,dz.$$Since the denominator is a difference of squares, we can factor the denominator as $$\int_{|z|=1}\frac{4z}{i}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{a(z^2+1)-b(z^2-1)}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{1}{a(z^2+1)-b(z^2-1)}\right)\,\,dz. $$This is where I really started running into trouble. I tried solving when the denominator of the right term vanished and I found $$z=\pm\sqrt{\frac{b+a}{b-a}}.$$ This didn't seem right because it doesn't always have to be inside the unit circle (I don't think), so I think I might have made an error in calculation. Is my method so far correct, or is there a far better way to calculate this integral using the residue formula? This isn't homework, just prepping for an exam.

353261,The limit of a recurrence relation (with resistors),"Background to problem (not too important): My proposed solution: The infinitely long element, , however complex, can be represented as a single resistor of resistance $R$. 
Remembering the initial resistor near $A$, we know $R_{AB}= r+R$. However, as this is an infinitely long element, it is equivalent to a resistor of resistance $R$ attached  to the right of two resistors of resistance $r$ (the resistance $R$ is an intrinsic property of the element, so is unaffected by the fact that the further to the right it is, the lower the current passing through it). Thus, taking $R$ in series with $r$, then the result in parallel with $r$, then in series with $r$: $$R_{AB}=  r + \left (\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R+r}+\frac{1}{r}}  \right )$$ On the second iteration (moving $R$ further to the right): $$R_{AB}= r+ \frac{1}{\frac{1}{r}+\frac{1}{r + \left (\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R+r}+\frac{1}{r}}  \right )}}$$ Ad infinitum.

He is showing how to derive $f(x)=\sin^{-1}(x)$. At some point he goes from the expression $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{\cos(y)}$ to $\frac{dy}{dx}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$. Ok, I know that's the result, that's how I always did it, but I never actually derived it myself. So yeah, I'd like to know what he did in those last two steps, to get from the first expression to the second. I know it may (will) be something completely stupid and I'll say 'oh... facepalm ',

Show that the diagonal set $ \Delta \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \{ (x,y) \in X \times Y \mid x = y \} $ is measurable with respect to the product measure $ \mu \otimes \nu $. (In fact, it is an $ F_{\sigma \delta} $-set.) Show also that if $ f $ is the characteristic function of $ \Delta $, then

$$ Is this a contradiction of either Fubini’s Theorem or Tonelli’s Theorem? Solution : For each $ n \in \mathbb{N} $ and each $ j \in \{ 1,\ldots,n \} $, let $ I_{j,n} $ denote the interval $ \left[ \dfrac{j - 1}{n},\dfrac{j}{n} \right] $. Also, for each $ n \in \mathbb{N} $, let $ I_{n} $ denote the union $ \displaystyle \bigcup_{j = 1}^{n} I_{j,n} $. Then we have $ \displaystyle \Delta = \bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty} I_{n} $, so $ \Delta $ is measurable. Next, observe that
$$

$$ Now, suppose that $ (A_{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}} $ and $ (B_{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}} $ are sequences of Borel subsets of $ [0,1] $ such that

\Delta \subseteq \bigcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} (A_{n} \times B_{n}).
$$
We can find an $ N \in \mathbb{N} $ such that $ B_{N} $ is infinite, which gives us $ (\mu \otimes \nu)(A_{N} \times B_{N}) = \infty $. Hence,
$$
\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} (\mu \otimes \nu)(A_{n} \times B_{n}) = \infty.
$$
The definition of an outer measure therefore yields
$$
  \int_{X \times Y} \chi_{\Delta} ~ \mathrm{d}{(\mu \otimes \nu)}

I am kind of stuck, but here are my first attempts: I chose the series of subroups $G>H_8>H_4>H_2>H_1=\{e\}$ where $H_k$ has order $k$. All of these subgroups exist due to Sylow's Theorems. We have the quotients $H_8/H_4\cong H_4/H_2 \cong H_2/H_1 \cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, so $G>H_8\rhd H_4\rhd H_2\rhd H_1=\{e\}$. Only the factor $G/H_8 \cong \mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ is causing me a headache, because although its of prime order (and hence abelian) I don't know whether $H_8$ is normal in $G$ (unless $p=2$). If $p\ne 2$, then the number $k$ of Sylow $2$-subgroups is $1$ mod $2$. Since $k$ divides $|G|$ we might have $k=1$ or $k=p$. If we had $k=1$ then $H_8$ would be the only Sylow $2$-subgroup (and hence normal in $G$). But how could we show this? Or is there even an easier way to approach this problem? $\ $ edit: I am going to try a different approach: The case $p=2$ is clear. When $p=3$ or $p=7$ the group has order 24 or 56 and since the smallest simple non-abelian group has order 60, the group must also be solvable in these exceptional cases (as Mariano pointed out). In any other case we get a Sylow $p$-subgroup $H_p$ of order $p$, which is is normal in $G$. The quotient $G/H_p$ has order $8=2^3$; and prime power order implies solvable. So $G/H_p$ is solvable and $H_p$ is also solvable. And since the composition factors of $G$ are those of $H_p$ together with those of $G/H_p$, we conclude that $G$ is solvable iff $H_p$ and $G/H_p$ are solvable, which is the case. Hence $G$ is solvable if $|G|=8p$.","['solvable-groups', 'group-theory']"

I decided to model it in C# and not only did I fail to answer my question, but it seemed to make less and less sense to me. So basically, this is what I did. I chose a certain number of chips, along with a certain number of colors, to see how many shuffles it takes to return to the initial form. The shuffles are the same simple shuffle everyone sees at a poker table. The chips are all grouped by color in the beginning and the condition to satisfy is a return to this initial position. I did this for Chips ranging from 1-20, and colors ranging from 1 to 11.

353748,Asymptotic behavior of sum of squares of combinatorial numbers with a weight.,"Consider the following sequence of natural numbers, $$M_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 4^k$$ We can interpret $M_n$ as the cardinality of the set $X$ of $(2\times n)$-matrices with entries in $\{-1,0,1\}$ which have the same number of zeroes in both rows. My question is about the asymptotic behaviour of this sequence. It must be of the form $$M_n \sim C \frac{9^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}}$$ but I am unable to compute the constant $C$. What I am able to get is that $\sqrt{2}/2 \leq C \leq 3/2$. I briefly comment how I get these bounds. Lower bound: From all the $2\times n$ matrices which have exactly $2p$ rows of the form $\binom{\pm 1}{0}$ or $\binom{0}{\pm 1}$, only those which have exactly $p$ rows from each of the two types are in the set $X$. The proportion is thus $\binom{2p}{p}/{2^{2p}}$ . There are essentially $9^n/2$ matrices with entries $\{-1,0,1\}$ and even number of $\binom{\pm 1}{0}$ or $\binom{0}{\pm 1}$ entires, so we can write
$$M_n > \min_{2p\leq n}\left\{\binom{2p}{p}2^{-2p}\right\} \cdot 9^n/2$$
The sequence to minimize is decreasing, so (assume $n$ is even for simplicity)
$$M_n > \binom{2n}{n}2^{-2n} \cdot 9^n/2$$
and applying Stirling's formula we get the lower bound. Upper bound: If we fix a lower row $F$ with $p$ many zeros, there $k_p = 2^{n-p} \binom{n}{p}$ matrices in whose lower row is F. Since there are $3^n$ possible rows, we can bound,
$$M_n < 3^n  \max_{p\leq n}k_p$$
This maximum can be computed by looking at the quotient $k_{p+1}/k_p$ and one checks that it is attained essentially at $p = n/3$, so
$$M_n < 3^n \cdot 2^{2n/3}\binom{n}{n/3}$$
and applying again Stirling's formula we get the upper bound.","['asymptotics', 'combinatorics']"

$$\sin(2x) + \dfrac{3\sin(2x)}{\tan(2x)} = 0$$
$$\sin(2x)\left(1 + \dfrac{3}{\tan(2x)}\right) = 0$$ Resulting in $$\sin(2x) = 0\ or\ \tan(2x)=-3$$ I cannot find anything wrong with this method, except that the solutions that $\sin(2x)$ give are not correct when I tested the results back in the original equation.
