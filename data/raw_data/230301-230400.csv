4776855,Probability of selected ball color,"You are on a game show. There are 3 bins in front of you labelled 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶, with bin 𝐴 having 1 white balls and 1 black ball, bin 𝐵 have 3 White and 2 Black balls, and bin 𝐶 having 5 White and 2 black balls. Without you seeing, the game show host chooses one of the bins at random (so that bin 𝐴 gets selected with probability 1/3, the same for bins 𝐵, 𝐶) and then selects a ball at random from the bin selected. a) What is the probability the ball selected by the game show host is White?
b) Conditional on the event that the ball selected is White, what is the chance the game show host selected bin 𝐶 was selected? I am honestly very lost on both of these questions- I think we'd have to do the probability of the white over the probability of all outcomes for a, which I think could be (1/3)(1/2) + (1/3)(3/5) + (1/3)(5/7) = 127/210. For b. (5/7)(1/3)/(127/210). Can anyone let me know if I'm doing something wrong, and how I should go about the problem?","['statistics', 'probability']"
4776876,Why can we pass limit under integral sign in proof of solving Poisson's equation? (Evans PDE),"On page 23 of Lawrence Evans' Partial Differential Equations text (2nd edition) he claims that $$\frac{ f( x + he_i - y) - f( x-y)}{h} \to \frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x_i} ( x-y)$$ uniformly on $\mathbb{R}^n$ as $h \to 0$ . So $$\frac{ \partial u}{ \partial x_i } (x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n }\Phi(y) \frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x_i} ( x- y) dy$$ Why does this hold true? I have proved uniform convergence as follows: Proof: It suffices to show that $$\underbrace{ \frac{ f( x + h e_i - y ) - f( x-y) }{ h} - \frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x_i } ( x-y)}_{g_h(y)}  \to 0 $$ uniformly as $h \to 0$ . But by the Mean Value Theorem, for each $h$ there exists a $\theta_h$ such that $0 < \theta_h < 1$ and $\frac{ f( x + h e_i - y ) - f( x-y) }{ h}  = f_{x_i} ( x+ \theta_h h e_i - y) $ . So \begin{align*} g_h(y) &=  \frac{ f( x + h e_i - y ) - f( x-y) }{ h} - \frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x_i } ( x-y) \\
&=  f_{x_i} ( x+ \theta_h h e_i - y)  -  f_{x_i} ( x-y) 
\end{align*} but $f_{x_i}$ is uniformly continuous ( $f \in C_c^2$ so $f_{ x_i} \in C_c^1$ and therefore continuous on a compact set, so uniformly continuous). Therefore, regardless of $y$ , for small enough $h$ this difference can be made arbitrarily small. So $g_h(y) \to 0$ uniformly, as we intended to show. QED. But how does uniform convergence allow us to move the derivative through the integral sign?","['poissons-equation', 'linear-pde', 'analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

4776966,Cup product structure on $\mathbb{R}P^2$,"I don't understand a passage in my lecture notes. Here is the passage with my questions added in italics: $H^\ast(\mathbb{R}P^2;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$ is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ in degrees $1$ and $2$ . Let $\gamma$ be the a generator of $H^1(\mathbb{R}P^2;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$ . Let us compute $\gamma \cup \gamma$ . Recall the presentation $\mathbb{R}P^2$ as a circle ( It should be ""disk"" and not ""circle“, right? ) with the two halves of the boundary identified. We fix a base point $\ast$ . Let $\ast_1$ be the constant $1$ -simplex and $\ast_2$ the constant $2$ -simplex at the base point $\ast$ . Let $c$ be the $1$ -simplex that is half the boundary of the disk, it is easy to see this is a generator for $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}P^2, \ast)$ and thus for $H_1(\mathbb{R}P^2;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$ . ( How do I see that $c$ is a generator for $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}P^2, \ast)$ ? ). Lastly, let $s$ be the $2$ -simplex that maps onto the disk homeomorphically, with boundary $2\gamma -\ast_1$ . ( This should read "" $2c-\ast_1$ "" and not "" $2\gamma -\ast_1$ ""? ). It follows that $s-\ast_2$ is a generator of $H_2(\mathbb{R}P^2)$ . ( Why does that follow? ). We then must have $\gamma(c)=1$ and $\gamma(\ast_1)=0$ . ( $\gamma(\ast_1)=0$ follows from $\ast_1=\partial \ast_2$ and $\gamma(c)=1$ from $\gamma\neq 0$ and $c$ being a generator of $H_1(\mathbb{R}P^2;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$ , correct? ). We therefore find $\gamma \cup \gamma (s)=1$ and $\gamma \cup \gamma (\ast_2)=0$ . We still need to show that $\gamma\cup \gamma$ is not a coboundary ( Why is this not obvious? ).","['general-topology', 'homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-topology', 'projective-space']"
4777074,Tangent spaces of $\Bbb P^1$,"Consider the following descriptions of the complex projective

The set of non-zero pairs of complex numbers $(z_0,z_1) \in \Bbb C^2 \setminus \{0\}$ with the equivalence relation $(z_0,z_1) \sim (w_1,w_2)$ if $(z_0,z_1)$ and $(w_0,w_1)$ lie on the same line through the origin. Describe the space of holomorphic vector fields on $\Bbb P^1$ in terms of each presentation; determine, in particular, which vector fields correspond to rotations of the sphere. Similarly describe the space of holomorphic $1$ -forms. So I'm trying to figure out these and I'm stuck with not knowing what is the tangent bundle $T\Bbb P^1$ . If I knew this, then the vector fields would be the sections $\Gamma(T\Bbb P^1)$ and similarly I could look at the cotangent bundle $T^*\Bbb P^1$ and the $1$ -forms would be the sections $\Gamma(T^*\Bbb P^1)$ . So the question is how do I figure out this tangent bundle? By definition it is $$T\Bbb P^1 = \bigsqcup_{p\in\Bbb P^1} T_p\Bbb P^1$$ but in order to understand this I need to understand $T_p\Bbb P^1$ . So here I'm stuck I know that $\dim_\mathbb{C}\Bbb P^1 = 1$ so $T_p\Bbb P^1$ is also $1$ -dimensional as a complex vector space. The way the question is set up seems like there are different descriptions for $T_p\Bbb P^1$ in either case which I'm not able to figure out.","['complex-manifolds', 'projective-space', 'differential-geometry']"

4777165,Abelianization of Non-Abelian Groups,"Let $\mathbf{Grp}$ be the category of groups and $\mathbf{Ab}$ be the category of abelian groups, whose $\text{Hom}$ sets are group homomorphisms. We can define a forgetful functor $\mathcal{F}: \mathbf{Ab}\to\mathbf{Grp}$ by ""forgetting"" that the group is abelian; i.e. $\mathcal{F}(G) = G$ , $\mathcal{F}(f) = f$ for all abelian groups $G$ and abelian group homomorphisms $f$ . Likewise, we can define an abelianization functor $\mathcal{G}:\mathbf{Grp}\to\mathbf{Ab}$ by $\mathcal{G}(G) = G/[G, G]$ , where $[G, G]=\{ghg^{-1}h^{-1}\mid g, h\in G\}$ is the commutator of $G$ , and for any $f\in \text{Hom}_{\mathbf{Grp}}(G, H)$ , we have $\mathcal{G}(f):G/[G, G]\to H/[H, H]$ given by $x[G, G]\mapsto f(x)[H, H]$ . Now one can trivially check that $\mathcal{G}$ is a surjective functor; that is, every abelian group is the abelianization of some group (for instance, itself). But this conclusion didn't seem satisfying to me. Consider the category $\mathbf{Nab}$ of non-abelian groups. We define a functor $\mathcal{H}:\mathbf{Nab}\to\mathbf{Ab}$ similarly to $\mathcal{G}$ ; by abelianizing the group. My question: Is $\mathcal{H}$ surjective?

4777198,Graded-commutativity of cup product: Non-commuative coefficient ring,"For $R$ a commutative ring and $X$ a topological space the cup product on the singular cohomology $H^{\ast}(X)$ is graded commutative. I have a question about the proof of this claim. Some definitions first: Given topological spaces $X,Y$ and open subsets $A\subseteq X$ , $B\subseteq Y$ , pick a chain homotopy equivalence $$EZ\colon S_{\ast}(X\times Y,X\times B \cup A \times Y;R)\rightarrow S_{\ast}(X,A;R)\otimes S_{\ast}(Y,B;R).$$ For $\alpha \in S^p(X,A;R)$ and $\beta \in S^q(Y,B;R)$ , define the cohomology cross product as $$\alpha \times \beta:=\mu\circ(\alpha\otimes \beta)\circ EZ_{p+q}.$$ The proof I know goes as follows: We first show that the cohomology cross product is graded commutative. The claim then follows from $\alpha\cup \beta=\Delta^{\ast}(\alpha \times \beta)$ , where $\Delta\colon X\rightarrow X\times X$ is the diagonal map and $\alpha \in H^p(X)$ , $\beta \in H^q(X)$ . Denote by $T\colon X\times Y \rightarrow Y\times X$ the map that swaps the arguments and by $\tau \colon S_{\ast}(Y)\otimes S_{\ast}(X) \rightarrow S_{\ast}(X)\otimes S_{\ast}(Y)$ the usual braiding in the monoidal category of chain complexes (i.e. $x\otimes y \mapsto (-1)^{\vert x \vert \vert y \vert}y\otimes x$ ). The chain map $\tau \circ EZ \circ T$ agrees with $EZ$ on $S_0$ . Therefore it is chain homotopic to $EZ$ and we could have used $\tau \circ EZ \circ T$ to define the cross product. If we use $\tau \circ EZ \circ T$ to define the cohomological cross product (denote this operation by $\times^{\tau}$ ), we find $\alpha \times^{\tau} \beta= (-1)^{\vert \alpha \vert \vert \beta \vert}\beta\times \alpha.$ The claim follows. Where did we use that $R$ is commutative? Why does the fact that the chain map $\tau \circ EZ \circ T$ agrees with $EZ$ on $S_0$ imply that it is chain homotopic to $EZ$ ? I know that if the domain of $EZ$ is a projective resolution, this is just the fundamental lemma of homological algebra. But in this case the domain of $EZ$ is generally not an exact sequence.","['homological-algebra', 'solution-verification', 'general-topology', 'homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-topology']"

There's an obvious geometric map that behaves the same, at least over a field: $$\mathbf Z(f)\amalg \mathbf Z(g)\longleftarrow \mathbf Z(f)\cup \mathbf Z(g)\subset \mathbb A^1.$$ It's morally clear this map is invertible iff the union is disjoint i.e the intersection is empty i.e $f,g$ have no common root. By the duality of (a subcategory of?) rings and a (subcategory of?) affine scheme, I'd expect the latter, that is very canonical in geometry, to come from some $A$ -algebra morphism. But it does not seem to be the one represented by the Sylvester matrix, since $(1,v)\mapsto f+vg,(u,1)\mapsto uf+g$ and the product $(u,v)\mapsto uf+vg$ which is not (I think) the product of the values $(f+vg)(uf+g)=uf^2+vg^2\in \tfrac{A[x]}{\langle fg\rangle}$ .

4777416,How does the common definition of a function satisfy the precise definition of a function?,"Before my reading on Linear Algebra by Hoffman/Kunze, I was under the impression that a function was "" a rule (or mathematical object) that maps/assigns each $x \in X$ (domain) to an element $y \in Y$ (codomain) "". However, stumbling across Hoffman/Kunze's LA book, in the appendix, it defines a functions as a mathematical object which consists of: Domain $\longrightarrow$ set of possible inputs Co-domain $\longrightarrow$ set of possible values outputted Rule $\longrightarrow$ associates each element in the domain to a single element in the codomain This got me confused as I previously interpreted the rule being the whole function, not being only a part of the function. This changed my understanding because functions were no longer just ""a rule that maps..."" but instead an object that consisted of a rule and other parts. I did some researching and stumbled across a few ""more precise"" (but less common) definitions where it also stated that function as three parts. For example, Joe's answer here states that a function is... Definition. A function is an (ordered) triple ( $X$ , $Y$ , $f$ ), where $X$ and $Y$ are sets, and $f$ is a subset of $X \times Y$ satisfying the following properties: For every $x \in X$ , there is a $y \in Y$ such that ( $x$ , $y$ ) $\in f$ . For every $x \in X$ , and for all $z$ , $z' \in Y$ , if ( $x$ , $z$ ) $\in f$ and ( $x$ , $z'$ ) $\in f$ then $z=z'$ . Additionally, a few other sources (that I could find online) define it nearly the same way (with a few saying $f$ is a graph instead of a rule), such as Asaf Karangila's answer , Reed College's  Math 111 Lecture Note , Topoi by Robert Goldblatt , etc. Eventually, I concluded my search and problems by accepting the ordered triple definition of the function. I told myself that the reason why the less precise definition of the function defined it as a rule was because of something that Joe and my LA book mentioned in common. Taken from the same answer by Joe, it says: Commentary. If our definition is to be taken seriously, then $f$ is not the function: rather it is the graph of the function. Nevertheless, it is conventional to abuse notation and refer to the triple ( $X$ , $Y$ , $f$ ) as $f$ for short. Similarly, in Hoffman/Kunze's LA book, it comments: If ( $X$ , $Y$ , $f$ ) is a function, we shall also say $f$ is a function from $X$ into $Y$ . This is a bit sloppy, since it is not $f$ which is the function; $f$ is the rule of the function. However, this use of the same symbol for the function and its rule provides one with a much more tractable way of speaking about functions. To clarify, I told/convinced myself that functions are commonly defined as rules because people would ""sloppily"" abuse the notation $f$ and refer it to both the function and its rule, which therefore caused an adaptation to the definition of a function being a rule. However, I still feel that my reasoning isn't perfect and in some way, still don't understand whether the definition of a function as a rule is correct or not and why people define it like that. Is it saying something different from the precise definition of a function, or am I not understanding something correctly? Are there any flaws to the rule definition of the function?","['definition', 'functions']"

For a topological space $X$ and compact Hausdorff space $Y$ , a function $X \to Y$ is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed subset of $X \times Y$ .

Yes you can see it, it is obvious but seeing in itself is no proof. Yes you cannot construct a countermodel, but again that is no proof. I am really stumped with this one, it is so obvious, and easy to see, but a proof? As definition of an ellipse I want to use: (reused from Wikipedia) An ellipse is a plane curve surrounding two focal points, such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two distances to the points is a constant. As definition of the axis i want to use: (all made up by myself, so maybe incorrect, the second one, defining the minor axis,  was a real struggle ;) The first axis of the ellipse is the line containing the longest segment possible between two points on the ellipse. The second axis of the ellipse is the line containing the midpoint of the two focal points and the shortest segment possible between two points on the ellipse,","['proof-writing', 'geometry']"

4777810,Are all nilpotent matrices strictly upper triangularizable (over the complex and real fields)?,"According to this question, strictly upper triangular matrices are nilpotent (over any field). Does it also hold tha nilpotent matrices $N$ are strictly upper triangularizable? (i.e. they are conjugate that an strictly upper triangular matrix $N = JUJ^{-1}$ with $J$ and $U$ both complex). In the complex case, it seems trivial to me that the Jordan canonical form has zeros on its diagonal and is thus strictly upper triangular. However, I have not seen this characterization of complex nilpotent matrices so I might be missing something.
This would be related to the Jordan decomposition of matrices/endomorphisms into a semisimple and nilpotent part. For the complex case, semisimple is the same as diagonalizable, and, if my intuition is correct, the nilpotent part is the same as strictly upper triangularizable. This perfectly relates to the Jordan canonical form of complex matrices, which implies that all complex matrices are triangularizable. Also, what about the real case? Does my statement about nilpotent matrices being strictly upper triangularizable still hold? The Jordan canonical form should be the same (with given signature), although they might not be conjugate via a real matrix, so I'm not sure whether it is still true. For the real case, the semisimple part is conjugate to a block decomposition where you might also have some two-dimensional blocks which are non-scalar/not proportional to the identity (as per this question), so ""kind of"" diagonalizable. Does something similar hold for real nilpotent matrices - ""kind of"" strictly upper triangularizable?

4778014,Existence a uniqueness theorems for ODEs: two proofs compared,"Lately I've been studying the existence [and uniqueness] theorem for ODEs. As is often the case with beautiful theorems, there are several proofs of this fact. Today I want to focus on two elementary proofs, and compare them somewhat. First of all, let's write down exactly what the theorem says in the case of a non-autonomous vector field. Theorem . Let $ E $ be a normed space ( $ \mathbb R^n $ will suffice). Let $ U\subset E $ be open. Let $ I\subset \mathbb R $ be an open interval. Let $ X\colon U\times I\to E $ be continuous and locally uniformly Lipschitz in the second variable. Let $ x_0\in U $ and $ t_0\in E $ . Then there exists an open ball $ B\subset U $ around $ x_0 $ , an open interval $ J = \left]t_0-\alpha,t_0+\alpha\right[\subset I $ around $ t_0 $ , and a unique integral curve $ x\colon J\to U $ of $ X $ such that $ x(t_0) = x_0 $ and such that $ x(t)\in B $ for every $ t\in J $ . A common ground Both the proofs I have in mind start by noticing that there exists an open ball $ B(x_0,\epsilon)\subset U $ and an open interval $ \left]t_0 - \delta,t_0 + \delta\right[\subset I $ where $ \lVert X(x,t) \rVert\leqq M $ for some $ M > 0 $ . This is kinda easy to prove. Moreover, let's call $ K_0 $ some local Lipschitz constant of $ X $ around $ (x_0,t_0) $ . The first proof Let $ \alpha $ be such that $ \alpha < \epsilon/M $ and $ \alpha < \delta $ . One way to prove the Theorem is to define inductively $ x_n\colon J = \left]t_0 - \alpha,t_0 + \alpha\right[\to U $ for every $ n\in \mathbb N $ by $$
x_0(t) = x_0\text{,}\qquad x_{n + 1}(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t X(x_n(\zeta),\zeta)\,\mathrm d\zeta\text{.}
$$ By induction then $ x_n(t)\in B(x_0,\epsilon) $ and $$
\lVert x_n(t) - x_{n + 1}(t)\rVert\leqq \frac{MK^n}{(n + 1)!}\lvert t - t_0\rvert\text{,}
$$ thus the $ x_n $ s form a uniformly Cauchy sequence that converges to an integral curve of $ X $ . The second proof The second proof I had in mind uses the celebrated Banach fixed point theorem, or rather one of its corollaries. We basically define the operator $$
T\colon H\to K\text{,}\qquad (Tx)(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t X(x(\zeta),\zeta)\,\mathrm d\zeta
$$ where $ K $ is the space of bounded continuous functions $ x\colon J\to U $ equipped with the sup-norm $ \lVert\phantom{x}\rVert_\infty $ , and $ H $ is the open ball of radius $ \epsilon $ in $ K $ around the constant function $ \bar x_0 $ at $ x_0 $ . It is a general easy fact that if $ \lVert Tx - \bar x_0\rVert_\infty < (1 - C)\epsilon $ , where $ C $ is the contraction constant of $ T $ , then $ T $ has a fixed point that lies in $ H $ . A couple of questions The first one . The estimate to be made on $ \alpha $ in the second proof seems stronger. For the fixed point argument to work we need, in order: $ \alpha < \delta $ , $ \alpha < \epsilon/M $ (this ensures that $ Tx $ is again a bounded continuous mapping and thus lies in $ K $ ), and some other condition related to the fact that $ \lVert Tx - \bar x_0\rVert_\infty < (1 - C)\epsilon $ must hold. For example, Loomis&Sternberg's Advanced Calculus claims that $ \alpha $ should be smaller than $ \epsilon/(M + C\epsilon) $ . On the other hand, the first proof seems to work for all $ \alpha < \delta $ and $ \alpha < \epsilon/M $ . This surprises me. Did I do something wrong? The second one . This is more philosophic. I don't know anything about computational mathematics, but I was wondering: If one of these two iterative proofs were to be implemented on a computer, which one would it be? What's the differences between the two approaches. Or, on the contrary: How are they similar? I will follow a Dynamical Systems course next term and I hope it will clarify me some doubts, but for now I'm just leaving it there.","['dynamical-systems', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"

4778056,Contour Integral of Gamma Functions from Knuth Paper,"I was attempting to go through the addendum of Chapter 21 of Donald Knuth's Selected Papers on Analysis of Algorithms . In a lengthy derivation, Knuth asymptotically expands the following integral: $$ \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{c-i \infty}^{c + i \infty } \frac{\Gamma(s-5/2)\Gamma(4-s) m^s \zeta(s)}{\Gamma(3/2)} ds \sim \frac{\Gamma(-3/2)\Gamma(3)}{\Gamma(3/2)} m + \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \frac{\Gamma(3/2+n)}{\Gamma(3/2)} m^{5/2-n} \zeta(5/2-n) $$ where $\frac{5}{2} < c < 4$ . Knuth only states that the asymptotic series is obtained ""by decreasing c as far as we like and adding up the residues of the poles of the integrand"" - however I am having difficulty tracing the logic in how he did so. Considering the more general integral $$ \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{c-i \infty }^{c + i \infty } \frac{\Gamma(s-\alpha) \Gamma(\alpha+\beta-s)m^s\zeta(s)}{\Gamma(\beta)} $$ where $\alpha = A+\frac{1}{2}, \beta = B-\frac{1}{2}$ and both $A,B \in \mathbb{N}$ . The domain of integration is taken as the limit of the line integral from $c-iR$ to $c+iR$ as $R \to \infty$ . Note first that the integrand has poles whenever $s = k, k + \frac{1}{2}, k \in \mathbb{Z}$ . This function stems from an inverse Mellin transform with a fundamental strip of $\{ z \in \mathbb{C} : \alpha < \Re(z) < \alpha + \beta \}$ , so the integrand is only defined on this strip but can be analytically continued to the whole complex plane. Consider the contour $C = L \cup S$ where $L$ is the line segment going from $s=c-iR$ to $s=c+iR$ and $S$ be the semicircular contour going from $s=c+iR$ to $s=c-iR$ extending to the negative real axis (i.e. parametrized by $S(t) = c + Re^{i \theta}$ for $\theta \in (\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2})$ ). By the Residue Theorem, we have that $$\int_C f(z) dz = 2 \pi i \sum_{z \in [c, c-R] \cap \left( \mathbb{Z} \cup \mathbb{Z} + \frac{1}{2} \right)} \text{Res}\left(f; z\right)$$ where the sum is taken over the residues inside the contour (i.e. all integers and half integers in the interval $[c, c-R]$ ). We also have: $$ 2 \pi i \sum \text{Res} f(z) = \int_C f(z) dz = \int_{c-iR}^{c+iR} f(z) dz + \int_S f(z) dz $$ If we have that $\int_S f(z) dz \to 0$ as $R \to \infty$ , then Knuth's claim follows - however this is where I am stuck. I have tried to manipulate the inner gamma function terms with Stirling's approximation and have gotten nowhere, so some assistance here would be appreciated. Note: I am aware that there are some theorems involving Mellin transforms that I think are mentioned in the original paper that Knuth cites - however, I am trying to avoid them as it is made to seem as though this is a straightforward computation. Any assistance would be appreciated!","['integration', 'complex-integration', 'mellin-transform', 'gamma-function']"
4778063,Is there anyone among us who can identify a certain SUS space?,"The property US (""Unique Sequential limits"") is a classic example of property implied by $T_2$ and implying $T_1$ . In fact, it's the weakest assumption out of a chain of several distinct properties studied in the literature: $T_2$ $k_1$ -Hausdorff KC Weakly Hausdorff $k_2$ -Hausdorff (or $k_2H$ ) US $T_1$ During a recent meeting of the Carolinas topology seminar, some comments of Alan Dow got me to thinking about another intermediate property. We say that a long sequence is a continuous function $f:\kappa\to X$ for an infinite cardinal $\kappa$ , and it has a limit $x\in X$ provided for every neighborhood of $x$ , the neighborhood contains $f[\kappa\setminus\alpha]$ for some $\alpha<\kappa$ . Then let's call a space SUS (""strongly US"") if whenever a long sequence has a limit, this limit is unique. It's immediate that all SUS spaces are US. Furthermore, every $k_2H$ space $X$ is SUS: let $x,y$ be limits of a sequence $f:\kappa\to X$ . Then consider the compact Hausdorff space $K=(\kappa+1)\times\{0,1\}$ and the continuous function $g:K\to X$ defined by $g(\alpha,i)=f(\alpha)$ , $g(\kappa,0)=x$ , and $g(\kappa,1)=y$ . Note that there do not exist open neighborhoods $U,V$ of $(\kappa,0),(\kappa,1)$ with $f[U],f[V]$ disjoint, so it follows that $f(\kappa,0)=f(\kappa,1)$ and $x=y$ . The standard example of a US-not- $k_2H$ space is $\omega_1+1$ with the endpoint doubled : it's US as only trivial $\omega$ -length sequences converge to $\omega_1$ , but it fails to be SUS as the identity on $\omega_1$ is a long sequence with two distinct limits at the doubled endpoint. So, is it possible to construct a SUS space that's not $k_2H$ ? Let's call such a space an imposter . EMERGENCY MEETING: This space seems pretty SUS: $X=[0,1]\cup\{\infty\}$ where points of $[0,1]$ have their usual neighborhoods, and neighborhoods of $\infty$ must contain an open dense subset of $[0,1]$ . Of course its open subspace $[0,1]$ is definitely SUS: it's metrizable and thus Hausdorff. So it's sufficient to show that if $x\in[0,1]$ is a limit of a long sequence, $\infty$ is not a limit of that sequence. Let $x\in[0,1]$ be the limit of a long sequence given by $f:\kappa\to X$ . Then for each $n<\omega$ , there exists $\alpha_n<\kappa$ such that $B(x,1/2^n)$ contains $f[\kappa\setminus\alpha_n]$ . Suppose $\sup_{n<\omega}\alpha_n=\alpha<\kappa$ . Then $f[\kappa\setminus\alpha]=\{x\}$ , and $X\setminus\{x\}$ is a neighborhood of $\infty$ missing $f[\kappa\setminus\alpha]$ . Suppose $\sup_{n<\omega}\alpha_n=\kappa$ . Then $f\upharpoonright\{\alpha_n:n<\omega\}$ is a countable sequence converging to $x$ in $[0,1]$ . Then $\{\alpha_n:n<\omega\}$ is a nowhere dense subset of $[0,1]$ , so $X\setminus\{\alpha_n:n<\omega\}$ is a neighborhood of $\infty$ that fails to contain a final subsequence of $f$ . However, while I can tell that this space is not weakly Hausdorff (it contains a non-closed copy of the compact Hausdorff space $[0,1]$ ), it's not clear to me whether or not it is $k_2H$ (and therefore whether or not it is an imposter). Update: This space is not an imposter. Whoops. Here's why it's $k_2H$ . Let $K$ be compact Hausdorff, let $f:K\to X$ be continuous, and let $f(l)\not=f(k)$ . To check the $k_2H$ criterion, we need only consider the case where $f(l)=\infty$ as pairs of points in $[0,1]$ are separated by open sets in $X$ . Let $V$ be an open neighborhood of $l$ whose closure is contained in $f^\leftarrow[X\setminus\{f(k)\}]$ ; in particular, so $f(k)\not\in f[cl(V)]$ . It follows that $cl(V)$ is compact and thus $f[cl(V)]$ is compact. We claim it is closed in $X$ , so let $x$ be a limit point. If $x=\infty$ , $x=f(l)$ and we're done. Otherwise, pick $x_n\in B(x,1/2^n)\cap f[cl(V)]$ for each $n<\omega$ . Then the open collection $\{X\setminus\{x_n:N\leq n<\omega\}:n<\omega\}$ covers $X\setminus\{x\}$ but has no finite subcover for $\{x_n:n<\omega\}$ . It follows it cannot be a cover of $f[cl(V)]$ , showing $x\in f[cl(V)]$ . Since $f(k)\not\in f[cl(V)]$ , let $U=f^\leftarrow[X\setminus f[cl(V)]]$ . We have now obtained open neighborhoods $U,V$ for $k,l$ such that $f[U]\cap f[V]\subseteq (X\setminus f[cl(V)])\cap f[cl(V)]=\emptyset$ . Sidenote: after presenting related work to the Pitt topology seminar earlier today, Paul Gartside pointed out that perhaps a more natural definition for a ""strong US"" property would involve something like continuous functions from arbitrary Hausdorff spaces, rather than ordinals, and then consider unique limits (where a limit must have neighborhoods with co-compact intersection with the image). If we called this SUS', then we'd have $k_2H$ implies SUS' implies SUS. I think it's more likely for SUS' to be equivalent to $k_2H$ than the ordinal-focused SUS discussed here, but there's something else for folks to consider thinking about.","['separation-axioms', 'general-topology', 'compactness']"
4778096,Ramanujan's identity concerning a quotient of Dedekind's eta functions,"In his paper On certain Arithmetical Functions (published in Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society , XXII, No. 9, 1916, pp. 159-184) Ramanujan  presents the following identities (as if they are quite well known and rather obvious) \begin{align} 
f(q) &= q^{1^2/24}-q^{5^2/24}-q^{7^2/24}+q^{11^2/24}+\dots\tag{1}\\
f^3(q)&=q^{1^2/8}-3q^{3^2/8}+5q^{5^2/8}-7q^{7^2/8}+\dots\tag{2}\\

\frac{f^5(q^2)}{f^2(-q)}&=q^{1^2/3}-2q^{2^2/3}+4q^{4^2/3}-5q^{5^2/3}+\dots\tag{4}
\end{align} where $$f(q) =q^{1/24}(1-q)(1-q^2)(1-q^3)\dots\tag{5}$$ and $1,2,4,5, \dots$ are the natural numbers without the multiples of $3$ and $1,5,7,11,\dots$ are the natural odd numbers without the multiples of $3$ . The function $f(q) $ is Dedekind's eta function and due to the presence of 24th root the symbol $f(-q) $ is confusing. What is really meant by $f(-q) $ is the expression $$q^{1/24}(1-(-q))(1-(-q)^2)(1-(-q)^3)\dots$$ so that we change the sign of $q$ in factors other than $q^{1/24}$ . The formulas $(1),(2)$ are really well known as Euler's pentagonal theorem and Jacobi identity respectively and both of these can be derived using the Jacobi triple product identity $$\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{2n})(1+q^{2n-1}z)(1+q^{2n-1}z^{-1})=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}z^nq^{n^2}\tag{6}$$ Formula $(3)$ was recently discussed in this question and a proof based on Quintuple product identity is given in one of the answers. The formula $(4)$ is the one which is left to prove and the similarity of its left hand side with that of $(3)$ indicates that it may be amenable to Quintuple product identity as well. However I have been unable to establish it so far using Quintuple product identity. The identity is given in the form $$\frac{(\eta(3z)\eta(12z))^2}{\eta(6z)}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{n}{3}\right) nq^{n^2}\tag{7}$$ (where $q=\exp(2\pi i z) $ and $\eta(z) =f(q)$ ) as a part of a larger set of identities in the paper Eta-quotients and theta functions by Robert J. Lemke Oliver and it is established using the theory of modular forms. I am searching for a proof which avoids modular forms and is of a more elementary character.","['q-series', 'theta-functions', 'sequences-and-series']"
4778112,"$X$ is sub-Gaussian, then $X^2$ is sub-exponential","My goal is to show the following statement without using sub-exponential or sub-Gaussian norm; Let $X$ be a zero-mean sub-Gaussian random variable with the variance proxy $\sigma^2$ . Then $X^2$ is sub-exponential with parameters $(\nu, \alpha) = (16\sigma^2, 16\sigma^2)$ . For reference, the original material is on this site (complete lecture note) in lemma 1.12. Also, $X \in SG(\sigma^2)$ with $E[X] = \mu$ means sub-Gaussian and variance proxy $\sigma^2$ ; $$E[e^{t(X-\mu)}] \le e^{\frac{\sigma^2 t^2}{2}}, \forall t \in \mathbb R,$$ and $Z \in SE(\nu, \alpha)$ with $E[z] = \theta$ means sub-exponential with nonnegative parameter $(\nu, \alpha)$ ; $$E[e^{t(Z-\theta)}] \le e^{\frac{\nu^2 t^2}{2}}, \forall |t| < 1/\alpha.$$ Here is the partial proof; Let $Z = X^2 - E[X^2]$ for simplicity. Then, for $s \in \mathbb R$ , $$e^{sZ} = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \frac{(sZ)^k}{k!} = 1 + \frac{sZ}{1!} + \frac{(sZ)^2}{2!} + ...$$ Using this property, the proof goes as follows; $$\begin{align}
E[e^{sZ}] &= 1 + 0 +  \sum_{k = 2}^{\infty} \frac{s^kE[Z^k]}{k!} \sim (1) \\

Despite different initial conditions $F_0$ , quite a few of sequences become the same sequence when they share the same values: e.g.: $F_0 = 4, F_1 = 6, F_2 = 9,\color{red}{F_3 = 12, F_4 = 18,\dots}$ $F_0 = 8 ,\color{red}{F_1 = 12, F_2 = 18,\dots}$ For clarity, I'll refer to the sequence $F_0, F_1, F_2, \dots$ as $\mathscr{F}(F_0)$ (e.g.: So $\mathscr{F}(4)$ is the sequence $4, 6, 9, \dots$ ) Some observations that can be made are: Given sequence $(F_i)$ the following sequences share values: $\mathscr{F}(F_i)$ $\mathscr{F}\left(\frac{2}{3}F_i\right)$ if $\frac{2}{3}F_i \in \mathbb{N}$ $\mathscr{F}(F_i + 1)$ if $F_i$ is even It also seems every $\mathscr{F}(4 + 6n)$ is always a ""new"" sequence? It seems that if $\mathscr{F}(n)$ where $n < 4 + 6n$ Then $\mathscr{F}(n)$ and $\mathscr{F}(4 + 6n)$ do not share any values. Keeping track of every time an odd number appears in $\mathscr{F}(4)$ results in A087791 . Special case for (2) A special case for (2) can be solved using Theorem 3.10 from Concrete Mathematics: Let $f(x)$ be any continuous, monotonically increasing function with the property that: $$f(x) \in \mathbb{Z} \implies x \in \mathbb{Z}$$ Then: $$\left\lfloor f(x) \right \rfloor = \left\lfloor f(\lfloor x \rfloor) \right\rfloor$$ Using $f(x) = abx + bc$ , we can prove by induction that: $$F_n = a\lfloor f^n(bF_0) \rfloor +c \text{ where } f^n(x) = f(\underbrace{f(f(\dots))}_\textrm{n times}$$ We can then prove $f^n(x_0) = (ab)^n x_0 + \frac{1-(ab)^n}{1-ab}cb$ , and obtain the special case solution: If $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R^+}$ satisfies $\left(abx + bc \in \mathbb{Z} \implies x \in \mathbb{Z}\right)$ Then $$F_n = a \left\lfloor (ab)^{n-1} bF_0 + \frac{1-(ab)^{n-1}}{1-ab}cb \right\rfloor + c $$ Admittedly, I'm not quite happy with this result as the conditions are incredibly restrictive. It also does not solve my original problem (even for cases $d|c$ or $c|d$ ?)

Theorem. If $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B\rightarrow A$ are injections, then there's a bijection $h:A\rightarrow B$ . Proof. So we have injections $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B\rightarrow A$ . Assume that $B\setminus \text{ran}(f)$ is not empty, i.e. $f$ is not surjective. For any $\displaystyle b\notin ran( f)$ , let its sequence of distinct $\displaystyle a$ 's be defined by: $$a_{1} =g(b)$$ $$a_{n+1} =g( f( a_{n}))$$ To see why they are distinct, consider $\displaystyle a_{i}$ and $\displaystyle a_{j}$ for $\displaystyle i< j$ . Then since $\displaystyle f$ and $\displaystyle g$ are injective, the equality $\displaystyle a_{i} =a_{j}$ can be reduced to $\displaystyle b=g( f( a_{j-i}))$ , which is not possible since $\displaystyle b\notin ran( f)$ . As an example, consider $\displaystyle a_{3} =g( f( g( f( g( f( b))))))$ and $\displaystyle a_{5} =g( f( g( f( g( f( g( f( g( f( b))))))))))$ .
Then $\displaystyle a_{3} =a_{5}$ is same as saying $\displaystyle b=g( f( g( f( b))))$ . Each $a \in A$ is either in exactly one sequence or in none of them. Define $h:A\rightarrow B$ by $$
h(a) = 
\begin{cases} 
g^{-1}(a) & \text{if $a$ in some sequence} \\
f(a) & \text{else}

$$ To prove that $h$ is injective, we prove that we can't have $h(a_1) = h(a_2)$ with $h(a_1) = g^{-1}(a_1)$ and $h(a_2) = f(a_2)$ . Let $g^{-1}(a_1) = b_1$ . Now $a_1$ is an element of a sequence, so either $b_1 \notin \text{ran}(f)$ or $b_1 \in \text{ran}(f)$ . Case 1. $b_1 \notin \text{ran}(f)$ Then $b_1$ i.e. $g^{-1}(a_1) \neq f(a_2)$ . Case 2. $b_1 \in \text{ran}(f)$ Then $f^{-1}(b_1) = a'_{1}$ . Now $a'_{1} \neq a_{2}$ , since $a'_{1}$ is in a sequence but $a_{2}$ is not. That implies $f(a'_{1}) \neq f(a_{2})$ , which means $b_1$ i.e. $g^{-1}(a_1) \neq f(a_2)$ . To see that $h$ is surjective, take $b \in B$ and let $a = g(b)$ . If $a$ is in a sequence, then $h(a) = g^{-1}(a) = b$ . Otherwise $a$ is not in a sequence, so it must be that $b \in \text{ran}(f)$ .

Let's say both spheres travels in some direction in a straight line. At t=0, sphere 1 is at (0, 0, 0) and sphere 2 is at (50, 0, 0), their radius is both 30. At t=1, sphere 1 is at (100, 0, 0) but sphere 2 is at (-50, 0, 0). How do I check if sphere 2 have passed through sphere 1? (Just touching also count as ""passed through""). By just touching, I mean the path the two spheres took touched but didn't overlap. I can imagine the volume of the two spheres gouging out a capsule, and if this capsule encompasses any portion of the other capsule, then sphere 2 have gone through sphere 1 (true), other wise false. But I don't know how to verify if a portion of a volume is in another volume. Scrappy visual of what I'm saying: One sphere travels from yellow to grey, another travel from maroon to purple, how do I tell if the two paths overlap at some point. Update: Emac have provided an amazing break down of the problem, but I have failed to extend it to more complex scenarios. Take this scenario: All spheres have a radius of 0.5. The centre coordinates of Red and Blue spheres at time t=0 are at (5, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 6) respectively. At t=1, the red sphere remained stationary, and the blue sphere have travelled to (6, 2, 3.5). Examine this images, where I have lined up the camera with the end and start position of the blue sphere (final position of blue sphere is now green): We can see clearly that the path of the blue sphere will intersect the red sphere at some point in time. I attempted Emac's answer on this scenario. In my mind, the formula should still work. The derivative of the squared distance between two points in 3D space, then solving for the minimum of that formula seems like a universal solution to all these scenarios, but when I applied the formula, I got t = (4, 0, -2), and I can't make sense of a time vector. I thought perhaps I needed to find the magnitude of this time vector, and that will be my answer, but it returned a time larger than 1, which also doesn't make sense.

4778450,Discrete convolution and supports: can we have $\operatorname{supp}(f * g) \subsetneq \operatorname{supp}(f) + \operatorname{supp}(g)$?,"Let $G$ be a finite abelian group. For $f,g:G\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ functions. Define their convolution in a point $x\in G$ as $$(f*g)(x)=\sum_{y\in G}f(x-y)g(y)$$ From the definition of convolution is easy show that $$\operatorname{supp}(f*g)\subseteq \operatorname{supp}(f)+\operatorname{supp}(g)$$ When $\operatorname{supp}(f)$ denotes the set of points in $x\in G$ for which $f(x)\neq 0$ , and with similar definitions with $\operatorname{supp}(g)$ and $\operatorname{supp}(f*g)$ .

4778461,Is there a good reason why continuity assumed in the definition of differentiability in do Carmo?,"I am reading Do Carmo's Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces. He defines differentiability as follows: A continuous map [emphasis mine] $\varphi: V_1 \subset S_1 \to S_2$ of an open set $V_1$ of a regular surface to a regular surface $S_2$ is said to be differentiable at $p \in V_1$ if, given parametrizations $$x_1 : U_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \to S_1 \quad x_2 : U_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \to S_2 $$ with $p \in x_1(U_1)$ and $\varphi(x_1(U_1)) \subset x_2(U_2),$ the map $$x_2^{-1} \circ \varphi \circ x_1:U_1 \to U_2$$ is differentiable at $q = x_1^{-1}(p)$ . I believe that when he says continuous, and when he says that $V_1$ is open, he is referring to the topologies inherited from $\mathbb{R}^3$ . I was wondering why he assumes $\varphi$ to be continuous in the definition. I thought that it must be an easy consequence that $\varphi$ is continuous, if you know that all maps of the form $x_2^{-1} \circ \varphi \circ x_1$ are differentiable (hence continuous). However, I am starting to think that the continuity requirement is not superfluous. I think that for the definition to be correct, we must do one of two things. Either Assume $\varphi$ is continuous. In the definition, change ""given parametrizations"" to ""there exist parametrizations"". If we do neither, then I think there can be very badly behaved, discontinuous functions $\varphi$ where it is impossible to find parametrizations $x_1, x_2$ with $\varphi(x_1(U_1)) \subset x_2(U_2)$ . Hence, $\varphi$ would vaccuously be a diffeomorphism, even though it is discontinuous. However, if we do drop continuity but make change in $2$ , I think we can prove that $\varphi$ is continuous, and we get an equivalent definition to do Carmo's. Is my analysis above correct? EDIT: Proposition: Let $\varphi$ be any function from $S_1$ to $S_2$ . If for each point $p \in S_1$ there exist parametrizations $$x_1 : U_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \to S_1 \quad x_2 : U_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \to S_2 $$ with $p \in x_1(U_1)$ and $\varphi(x_1(U_1)) \subset x_2(U_2)$ such that the map $$x_2^{-1} \circ \varphi \circ x_1:U_1 \to U_2$$ is differentiable at $q = x_1^{-1}(p),$ then $\varphi$ is a continuous map from $S_1 \to S_2$ (with the topologies inherited from $\mathbb{R}^3$ ). $\textit{Proof: }$ Fix $p \in S_1$ and take parametrizations $x_1, x_2,$ and the point $q$ , as given in the claim. We will show that $\varphi$ is continuous at $p$ . Let $O_{S_2}$ be any open subset of $S_2$ containing $\varphi(p)$ , and let $O_{U_2} = x_2^{-1}(O_{S_2})$ , which is open because (by definition of parametrization) $x_2$ is a homeomorphism. Now $x_2 ^{-1} \circ \varphi \circ x_1$ is differentiable at $q$ , so it is continuous at $q$ . Since $O_{U_2}$ contains $x_2 ^{-1} \circ \varphi \circ x_1(q)$ , there exists an open subset $O_{U_1}$ of $U_1$ , containing $q$ , such that $x_2 ^{-1} \circ \varphi \circ x_1 (O_{U_1}) \subseteq O_{U_2}.$ Applying $x_2$ to both sides, we get $\varphi \circ x_1 (O_{U_1}) \subseteq x_2(O_{U_2}) = O_{S_2}.$ Finally, let $O_{S_1} = x_1(U_1)$ , which is open because $x_1$ is a homeomorphism. Substituting above, we have $\varphi(O_{S_1}) \subseteq O_{S_2}$ , which shows that $\varphi$ is continuous at $p$ . Since $p$ was arbitrary, $\varphi$ is continuous on $S_1.$","['manifolds', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

4778466,The Probability of Two Contestants Meeting (Ross),"This problem from Ross has been giving me grief, and none of the resources I’ve found have been helpful in elucidating where I’ve gone astray. $2^n$ players are paired off at random in a contest where each contestant is $50\%$ likely to win. The $2^{n-1}$ winners are paired off again randomly, and so on, until a single winner remains. Consider two contestants A and B, and events $A_i, i = 1, 2, …, n$ , and $E$ , defined by $A_i$ : A plays in exactly i contests. $E$ : A and B ever play each other during the course of the contest. (Not never!) What is $P(A_i)$ ? And what is $P(E)$ ? $P(A_i)$ is straightforward; $P(A_i) = (1/2)^i$ for $i=1,2,…,n-1$ and $P(A_n) = (1/2)^{n-1}$ . As for $P(E)$ , we can condition on the $A_i$ as they partition the space, but the trouble comes with calculating $P(E|A_i)$ . $P(E|A_1) = \frac{1}{2^n -1}$ . $P(E | A_2)$ to me seems to be $\frac{1}{2^n -1} + \frac{1}{2^n -2} \frac{1}{2}$ , as A can either meet B in round 1, or in round 2, if B wins in round 1. The formula for $P(E)$ gets messy in this case, and I’m further dissuaded from this answer by the hint that Ross provides, which is the formula $\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}ix^{i-1} = \frac{1-nx^{n-1} + (n-1)x^n}{(1-x)^2}$ Which suggests to me the possibility that $P(E|A_i) = \frac{i}{2^n -1}$ , which I could reason as A plays $i$ opponents, all of which are equally likely.

4778733,A property related to cofinal similarity,"A partial order $\le$ is reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric. It is directed , if for all $x, y$ in the set there is $z$ such that $x \le z$ and $y \le z$ . Let $X, Y$ be partially ordered, directed sets. A subset $T$ of $X$ is called cofinal (in $X$ ), if $\forall x \in X \space \exists t \in T \space (x \le t)$ . $\text{cof}(X) := \text{min} \{|T|: T \text{ is cofinal in } X\}$ . $X, Y$ are called cofinally similar , if there is a partially ordered set $Z$ in which both X and Y can be embedded as cofinal subsets.
In this case, $\text{cof}(X) = \text{cof}(Y)$ .
Of course, if $T$ is a cofinal subset of $X$ , then $X, T$ are cofinally similar. This is a well-treated concept, see for instance here and the references given in this paper.
It is relevant for many other branches, for instance topology or the theory of ultrafilters.
This paper mentions an equivalent statement to cofinal similarity in terms of certain maps. This immediately implies that cofinal similarity is transitive. Now let's define: $X, Y$ are strongly cofinally similar , if there is a partially ordered set $T$ , such that $T$ can be embedded into both, $X$ and $Y$ , as a cofinal subset. Obviously, if $X, Y$ are strongly cofinally similar, they are cofinally similar.
This gives rise to the following questions: Does the converse hold, i.e., if $X,Y$ are cofinally similar, are they strongly cofinally similar? (formerly question 3) Does the converse hold in certain classes, at least? Notes Of course, 2. is only relevant, if 1. is false. A partial answer to 2. is: yes, if $X$ is cofinally similar to a linearly ordered set.
(Since in this case, the regular cardinal $\text{cof}(X)$ embedds into $X$ and $Y$ as a cofinal subset.) It should be noted that the answer to 1 is affirmative, if and only if strong cofinal similarity is transitive. Thanks to M W for pointing this out. See his comment below for the simple argument. Consistently , each directed, non-empty set of size $\le \aleph_1$ is cofinally similar to one of these five sets, each equipped with its standard (partial) order: $1, \omega, \omega_1, \omega_1 \times \omega, [\omega_1]^{< \omega}$ . See the above-mentioned paper for the (very complicated) proof (where it is easy to see that these five ones are pairwise not cofinally similar).
Thus, a reasonable source for a counter-example might be a directed set cofinally similar to $\omega_1 \times \omega$ or to $[\omega_1]^{< \omega}$ . Update Why am I asking this question? I'm mainly interested in topology. In this area, it's reasonable to compare neighborhood bases just by their cofinality type (= equivalence classes of cofinal similarity). Here, of course, we consider the ordering defined by reverse set inclusion. For instance, any open neighborhood base is strongly cofinally similar to the neighborhood base. Or, more interestingly, if $x$ is a point in a dense subset $D$ of a regular topological space $X$ , the open neighborhood bases of $x$ in $D$ and in $X$ are strongly cofinally similar. P-points or points of first countability are completely characterized by the cofinality type of their neighborhood base. These statements may already motivate question 1: Is it really necessary to distinguish between cofinal similarity and the strong one?
And: can we use the benefits of transitivity to conclude that the neighborhood bases are strongly cofinally similar in the dense subset mentioned above? Update 2023-10-04 Finally, I found a counter-example, see below.","['filters', 'order-theory', 'general-topology']"

The reason I'm asking this is because the textbook and the solution of someone with a PhD in Mathematics have different answers (or at least, someone claiming to have it). I'll show both and then my approach. Problem: find the orthogonal trajectory of $r = c(1 + \cos(θ))$ Textbook solution without work: $r = c(1 - \cos(θ))$ PhD Mathematics solution: $$(1)\ \frac{dr}{dθ} = -c\sin(θ)$$ $$(2)\ \frac{1}{r}\frac{dr}{dθ} = -\frac{c}{r}\sin(θ)$$ $$(3)\ \frac{1}{r}\frac{dr}{dθ} = \frac{r}{c\sin(θ)}$$ $$(4)\ \frac{dr}{r^2} = \frac{1}{c}\csc(θ)dθ$$ Solve r by seperating variables $$(5)\ \frac{dr}{r^2} = \frac{1}{c}\csc(θ)dθ$$ After integrating both sides $$(6)\ -\frac{1}{r} = -\frac{1}{c}ln|\csc(θ) + \cot(θ)|- C$$ $$(7)\ r = -\frac{1}{\frac{1}{c}ln|\csc(θ) + \cot(θ)| + C}$$ Which is a different answer. Now I'm writing down how I did it. My Solution: $$(1)\ c = \frac{r}{1+\cos(θ)}$$ $$(2)\ c^{-1}r = 1 + \cos(θ)$$ $$(3)\ \frac{d}{dr}(c^{-1}r) = (1 + \cos(θ))\frac{d}{dr}$$ $$(4)\ c^{-1} = -\sin(θ)\frac{dθ}{dr}$$ $$(5)\ -\frac{1}{c\sin(θ)} = \frac{dθ}{dr}$$ After substituting into c, multiplying both sides by r to get into the right form and simplifying we get $$(6)\ -\frac{1+\cos(θ)}{\sin(θ)} = -\frac{dr}{rdθ}$$ $$(7)\ \frac{\sin(θ)}{1+\cos(θ)} = \frac{rdθ}{dr}$$ $$(8)\ \frac{1+\cos(θ)}{\sin(θ)}dθ = \frac{1}{r}dr$$ $$(9)\ \int \frac{1}{\sin(θ)} + \frac{\cos(θ)}{\sin(θ)}dθ = \int \frac{1}{r}dr$$ After integration $$(10)\ θ\arcsin(θ) + \sqrt{1-θ^2} + ln|\sin(θ)| + C_1 = \ln|r| + C_2$$ After isolating $$(11)\ r = e^{θ\arcsin(θ) + \sqrt{1-θ^2} + ln|\sin(θ)| + C}$$ My approach looks really bad, but its more about whether different solutions are possible and if it is how I will know whether my solution is a correct one.

4778794,On sub and super solutions; Teschl and others,"I'm reading Ordinary Differential Equations by Andersson and Böiers. There is a comparison theorem I have some questions about. I have also checked Teschl's Ordinary Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems, but there I have problems with his definition of a sub solution. I'll elaborate below. What follows is the comparison theorem in the book I first stated: Theorem . Assume that $f(t,x)$ is a continuous function in the strip $\{(t,x); t_0\leq t\leq t_1\}$ and satisfies a Lipschitz condition in a neighborhood of every point there. Furthermore, assume that $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ satisfy $$x'(t)=f(t,x)\quad\text{and}\quad y'(t)\geq f(t,y)$$ respectively, when $t_0\leq t\leq t_1$ . Then $$x(t_0)=y(t_0)\implies x(t)\leq y(t)\quad\text{when }t_0\leq t\leq t_1.$$ This definition is not made in the book, but I guess $y(t)$ is called a super solution. What confuses me in this theorem are the inequalities and how the theorem is modified when we change some of the inequalities to strict inequalities. First, I assume a corresponding result holds for a function $w(t)$ that satisfies $w'(t)\leq f(t,w)$ , so that $x(t_0)=w(t_0)\implies x(t)\geq w(t)$ when $t_0\leq t\leq t_1$ , right? Second, I'm working a problem where a function $y(t)$ satisfies $y'(t)> f(t,y)$ on a half-open strip, i.e. $t_0\leq t<t_1$ (because it is undefined at $t_1$ ). So how is the conclusion of the theorem modified if we change the assumptions to $y'(t)> f(t,y)$ and a half-open strip? Finally, in Teschl's book, he defines a sub solution $w(t)$ to be a function that satisfies $w'(t)< f(t,w)$ for $t_0\leq t<t_1$ . However, in my problem, I have a function $w(t)$ that satisfies $w'(t)\leq  f(t,w)$ for $t_0\leq t<t_1$ (in particular, $w'(t_0)=f(t_0,w(t_0))$ . Is this not a sub solution then? For completion, I post the proof of the theorem here. You can skip this of course. It uses the following lemma, stated without proof for the sake of brevity; Lemma . Let $x(t)$ be a differentiable function such that $$x'(t)\leq
> Mx(t)+a,$$ where $M\neq 0$ and $a$ are fixed constants. Then $$x(t)\leq e^{M(t-t_0)}x(t_0)+\frac{a}{M}(e^{M(t-t_0)}-1),\quad t\geq
> t_0.$$ Proof (of theorem). Assume that there is some point $\tau$ in the interval $[t_0,t_1]$ where $x(\tau)>y(\tau)$ . Then let $\bar t$ be the largest $t$ in $[t_0,\tau]$ with $x(t)\leq y(t)$ . Put $z(t)=x(t)-y(t)$ . Then $z(t)>0$ in $(\bar t,\tau]$ and $z(\bar t)=0$ . Furthermore, for $t$ near $\bar t$ , $$z'(t)=x'(t)-y'(t)\leq f(t,x(t))-f(t,y(t))\leq L(x(t)-y(t))=Lz(t).$$ The first inequality comes from the assumptions on $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ , the second one makes use of the Lipschitz condition. [The] lemma (with $a=0$ ) now implies, for $t$ in a right neighborhood of $\bar t$ , $$z(t)\leq e^{L(t-\bar t)}z(\bar t)=0.$$ We have arrived at a contradiction.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

Specifically, I am looking to prove that for two $n$ -dimensional Gaussian variables $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ and $Y_1,\cdots,Y_n$ , assume that $\mathbb{E}[X_i]=\mathbb{E}[Y_i]=0$ , $\mathbb{E}[X_i^2]=\mathbb{E}[Y_i^2]$ , $\mathbb{E}[X_iX_j]\leq \mathbb{E}[Y_iY_j]$ , we have for all $u_1,\cdots, u_{n-1} < 0$ : $$\mathbb{P}\left[\bigcap_{i=1}^{n-1} \{X_i \geq u_i \} \mid  X_n=0 \right]\leq \mathbb{P}\left[\bigcap_{i=1}^{n-1} \{Y_i \geq u_i \}\mid  Y_n=0 \right]$$ Intuitively this makes sense because $Y_i$ are more correlated with each other and thus should have a lower tail probability of being all far away from zero, but I have having a hard time proving it rigorously. I know Kahane's inequality and thought it can get me there, but the fact that I am conditioning on $X_n/Y_n=0$ makes a direct application difficult, so I was wondering if I am overlooking an easier approach.","['normal-distribution', 'probability-theory', 'random-variables']"
4778909,"The space of all square matrices with the same distinct real eigenvalues is a smooth submanifold of $\mathrm{Mat}(n,\mathbb{R})$","Problem: Let $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$ be distinct real numbers; set $\Lambda$ to be the matrix with $\Lambda_{ii}=\lambda_i$ and $$H = \{Q\in\mathrm{Mat}(n,\mathbb{R}):Q\text{ has eigenvalues }\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n\}\\=\{Q\in\mathrm{Mat}(n,\mathbb{R}):Q\text{ is similar to }\Lambda\}$$ I want to show that $H$ is a smooth submanifold of $\mathrm{Mat}(n,\mathbb{R})$ . Previous Work: Since the $\lambda_i$ are distinct, then any two matrices are similar to $\Lambda$ if and only if they have the same distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$ . Let $G=\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ and $M=\mathrm{Mat}(n,\mathbb{R})$ . Consider the smooth left action $\alpha:G\times M\to M$ given by conjugation, i.e., $\alpha(g,m)=gmg^{-1}$ . Considering the orbit of $\Lambda$ , we note that $H=G\cdot\Lambda$ . I am trying to show that $H$ is an embedded submanifold via a more direct approach: First, I want to show that $\alpha_{\Lambda}:G\to H\subset M$ is an immersion. Here is my attempt: Fix $g\in G$ and $X\in \mathrm{T}_gG=M$ . Let $\gamma_g:\mathbb{R}\to G$ be the curve given by $\gamma_g(t)=ge^{g^{-1}X}$ so that $\gamma_g(0)=g$ and $\gamma_g'(0)=X$ . We may use this curve to compute the differential of $\alpha_{\Lambda}$ at $X$ . Working with $\alpha_{\Lambda}\circ\gamma_g$ first, we have \begin{align*}
(\alpha_{\Lambda}\circ\gamma_g)(t)
&=\gamma_g(t)\Lambda\gamma_g(t)^{-1}\\
&=\gamma_g(t)\Lambda\gamma_g(-t)\\
&=ge^{g^{-1}Xt}\Lambda ge^{-g^{-1}Xt}\\
&=e^{Xg^{-1}t}\alpha_{\Lambda}(g)e^{-Xg^{-1}t}
\end{align*} so that \begin{align*}
\mathrm{D}_g\alpha_{\Lambda}(X)=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}e^{Xg^{-1}t}\alpha_{\Lambda}(g)e^{-Xg^{-1}t}\bigg|_{t=0}=Xg^{-1}\alpha_{\Lambda}(g)-\alpha_{\Lambda}(g)Xg^{-1}
\end{align*} Now, for this differential to be injective everywhere, i.e., $\mathrm{D}_g\alpha_{\Lambda}(X)=0\implies X=0$ , we have the condition $$Xg^{-1}\alpha_{\Lambda}(g)=\alpha_{\Lambda}(g)Xg^{-1}$$ $$\text{ or equivalently}$$ $$g^{-1}X\Lambda = \Lambda g^{-1}X$$ that is, $g^{-1}X$ commutes with $\Lambda$ . Since $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix with distinct entries, then $g^{-1}X$ has to be a diagonal matrix. This is where my progress stops. Alternative: I have found this math stack exchange post outlining a proof of a more general statement, that if Lie group acts smoothly on a manifold, then the orbits are immersed submanifolds. Moreover, if the action is proper, then the orbits are embedded submanifolds. The question I would have in this case is: how do I show that conjugation is a proper action? Question: I would be willing to give up on my previous work above, but not without asking someone else first. I am asking for a second look by someone with some more insight. Am I making an error anywhere in my previous work? Is there some connection I am not making to show that $X$ is zero? Any help is appreciated.

4779012,Show that a family is uniformly integrable,"I consider a family of sub sigma algebra $(\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\in S}$ on ( $\Omega,\mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P}$ ) and $X\in L^1(\Omega,\mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P})$ . I want to show that $Y_s =\mathbb{E}(X | \mathcal{F}_s)$ is uniformly integrable. My attempt is the following : I use the caracterization in terms of boundedness of a uniformly integrable family. First we notice that there exists $M\geq 0$ such that $\mathbb{E}(\lvert X\rvert)\leq M$ . Now we notice that for all $s\in S$ we have $$
\lVert Y_s \rVert_{L^1} = \mathbb{E}\left\lvert[\mathbb{E}(X | \mathcal{F}_s)\right\rvert] \leq \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}(\lvert X 
\rvert | \mathcal{F}_s)] = \mathbb{E}(\lvert X\rvert)\leq M
$$ Which shows that the family is bounded in $L^1$ and thus uniformly integrable. Is this seems correct ? Edit : This is false, my memory was totally wrong as my intuition. To solve the problem unfortunately I have not found other solutions than strenghten  hypothesis by considering that $X\in L^p$ in order to use a characterization in terms of epsilon delta of the uniform integrability. First we notice that there exists $M$ such that for all $s\in S$ $\lVert Y_s\rVert_{L^p}\leq M$ Let $\epsilon>0$ . Take $\delta = \frac{\epsilon^q}{M^q}$ . We have $$
\mathbb{E}(\lvert Y_s\rvert 1_{A})\leq \lVert Y_s\rVert_{L^p}(\mathbb{P}(A))^{1/q}\leq M(\mathbb{P}(A))^{1/q}\leq M\frac{\epsilon}{M}

4779021,Explicitly showing the finite dimensional distribution of Brownian motion is consistent,"I wish to explicitly prove the family of finite dimensional distributions used to define Brownian motion is consistent. The definition of consistent I am using is taken from Stochastic analysis and diffusion processes by Gopinath Kallianpur and Padmanabhan Sundar. A family of finite dimensional distributions is consistent if the following condition holds: Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $ 0 \leq t_1 < \ldots < t_k$ be arbitrary. Let $\{B_i\}_{i=1}^k$ be an arbitrary collection of 1-dimensional Borel sets. Then for any $i$ we have, $$
\mu_{t_1,\ldots,t_k}(B_1 \times \ldots \times B_{i-1} \times \mathbb{R} \times B_{i+1} \times \ldots B_k) = \mu_{t_1,\ldots,t_{i-1},t_{i+1},\ldots,t_k}(B_1 \times \ldots \times B_{i-1} \times B_{i+1} \times \ldots B_k).
$$ For simplicity let $k=2$ , $0 \leq t_1 \leq t_2$ and fix an $x \in \mathbb{R}$ . Then for any two Borel sets $B_1$ and $B_2$ define, $$
\mu_{t_1,t_2}(B_1 \times B_2) = \int_{B_1 \times B_2} \frac{\exp(-\frac{|x-y|^2}{2t_1})}{\sqrt{2 \pi t_1}} \cdot \frac{\exp(-\frac{|y-z|^2}{2(t_2-t_1)})}{\sqrt{2 \pi(t_2- t_1)}} d\lambda^2(z, y),
$$ where $d\lambda^2(z ,y)$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Now to prove this is consistent we need to show $\mu_{t_1,t_2}(\mathbb{R} \times B_2)=\mu_{t_2}(B_2)$ (the case where $B_2=\mathbb{R}$ is easy). By Fubini's theroem we can write, \begin{align*}
    \mu_{t_1,t_2}(\mathbb{R} \times B_2) & = \int_{\mathbb{R} \times B_2} \frac{\exp(-\frac{|x-y|^2}{2t_1})}{\sqrt{2 \pi t_1}} \cdot \frac{\exp(-\frac{|y-z|^2}{2(t_2-t_1)})}{\sqrt{2 \pi(t_2- t_1)}} d\lambda^2(z, y)\\
    &= \int_{\mathbb{R}} \int_{B_2} \frac{\exp(-\frac{|x-y|^2}{2t_1})}{\sqrt{2 \pi t_1}} \cdot \frac{\exp(-\frac{|y-z|^2}{2(t_2-t_1)})}{\sqrt{2 \pi(t_2- t_1)}} dz dy.
\end{align*} My issue is how to evaluate this integral as $y$ appears in both exponents. Am I missing a simple trick? Pretty much every author says this is trivial and leaves it as an exercise. Any help is greatly appreciated. Edit: To add extra clarity to my question as advised in a comment, I am interested in showing consistency using the explicit densities. The reason for this is that in order to claim existence of Brownian motion you need to explicitly construct the finite dimensional distribution denoted $\mu_{t_1,\ldots,t_k}$ on $\mathbb{R}^k$ and show said construction is consistent. Thus apriori you cannot make any claims about any stochastic process such as $\mathbb{P}(X_{t_1} \in B_1, X_{t_2} \in B_2 )=\mathbb{P}(X_{t_2} \in B_2, X_{t_1} \in B_1 )$ , as neither the probability measure or process exist.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-distributions', 'probability-theory']"

I'd like to understand the relationship between the following three limits. $\displaystyle \lim_{v\to 0} \frac{g(v)}{\|v\|}=0$ $\displaystyle \lim_{v\to 0} \frac{g(tv_0)}{t}=0$ , for all $v_0\in\mathbb R^2$ . $\displaystyle\lim_{t\to 0} \frac{g(\gamma(t))}{t}=0$ , for all differentiable path $\gamma:(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\to U$ such that $\gamma(0)=(0,0)$ . Remarks: Limits having the form 1 appear in the definition of differentiability. It is clear that 1 implies 2 (what is used, for example, to prove existence of the directional derivatives of differentiable functions). In general, 2 does not imply 1 (what can be seen, for example, by defining $g(0,0)=0$ and $g(x,y)=\frac{x^3y}{x^6+y^2}$ otherwise). Of course, 2 is a much weaker version of 3 (with $\gamma$ restrict to linear paths of the form $\gamma(t)=tv_0$ ). Question: Does 3 imply 1? I couldn't prove it (for example, I'm not able to connect $|v|$ with $t$ in a $\delta$ - $\epsilon$ proof; I also cannot see how could we find a $\delta$ that works for all $v$ inside a disk since each $\delta=\delta_\gamma$ works only for $v$ in the image of $\gamma$ ). Also, I couldn't construct a counterexample. In fact, in every case that I have seen in which 1 fails, there are differentiable paths that do not satisfy the limit in 3.","['limits', 'multivariable-calculus', 'vector-analysis']"

After one minute if area is increasing by $35cm^2$ it should be $75 cm^2$ . But when I substitute new base and height I got different number: $A = \frac{1}{2}*11*15 = 82.5$ Here I am confused as I would expect area to match original area + rate of change. What exactly that $35 cm^2$ means and why those numbers does not match?","['related-rates', 'calculus']"
4779525,Tensor of globally generated is globally generated,"Consider $X$ a scheme, $\mathcal F, \mathcal G$ globally generated sheaves. I want to show that $\mathcal F\otimes \mathcal G$ is globally generated. By definition we have surjective morphisms $f:\oplus_{I\in I}\mathcal O_X\to \mathcal F$ , $g:\oplus_{j\in J}\mathcal O_X\to \mathcal G$ . From them I considered for $U\subseteq X$ open $(\oplus_{I\in I}\mathcal O_X)\otimes(\oplus_{j\in J})(U)\to \mathcal F(U)\otimes \mathcal G(U)$ given by $u\otimes v\mapsto f(u)\otimes g(u)$ By considering stalks I think this is surjective (we can't deduce surjectivity from maps on open sets). So we have a surjective morphism $\varphi$ from $(\oplus_{I\in I}\mathcal O_X)\otimes(\oplus_{j\in J}\mathcal O_X)$ to the tensor presheaf. However we want a map which goes in the tensor sheaf, which have the same stalks. At first I considered the sheafification map $\theta: ( F\otimes \mathcal G)^{\operatorname{pre}}\to \mathcal F \otimes \mathcal G$ and said $\theta_p\circ \varphi_p=\varphi_p$ but reading it again made me realize it could be false, so $\theta \circ \varphi$ might not being a good choice despite being the most natural way to have a map to the sheaf.

4779547,Is it possible to redefine measurable spaces such that measurable functions are not defined in terms of pre-image?,"We know that a measurable space is defined as a tuple $(X,\mathcal A)$ , where $X$ is a set and $\mathcal A$ is a $\sigma$ -algebra defined on $X$ . A $\sigma$ -algebra is traditionally defined as a collection of subsets such that the whole set is in collection and it is closed under complements and countable union. A function $f:(X,\mathcal A)\to (Y,\mathcal B)$ is called measurable if for every $U\in \mathcal B,\ f^{-1}(U)\in\mathcal A$ . We note that this definition uses the pre-image as a central notion. An analogous construction is a topology $\tau$ on a set $X$ , where $\tau$ is defined as a collection of subsets of $X$ such that it contains the whole set and the empty set and is closed under arbitrary union and finite intersection. A function $f:(X,\tau)\to (Y,\tau')$ is called continuous if for every $U\in \tau',\ f^{-1}(U)\in\tau$ . We again note that this definition uses the pre-image as a central notion. But in the case of topology, there exists an equivalent characterization using the so called Kuratowski closure operator $\bf c$ in terms of which continuous functions are defined as a function $f:(X,\mathbf{c})\to(Y,\mathbf{c}')$ such that $f(\mathbf c(U)) \subseteq \mathbf c'(f(U))$ for all $U\subseteq X$ . We note that this definition does not use pre-images and is equivalent to the traditional definition of continuous functions. Is there a similar reformulation of $\sigma$ -algebras such that measurable functions also does not use pre-images in it's definition? In fact, is there a reformulation such that measurable functions can be defined as exactly those functions such that $f(g(U))\subseteq g'(f(U))$ for all $U\subseteq X$ , where $g,g'$ are functions from power set of $X,Y$ to power set of $X,Y$ respectively?","['measurable-sets', 'general-topology', 'measurable-functions', 'measure-theory']"

4779665,Basic Understanding of derivatives as a rate of change,"I am teaching myself calculus and trying to understand derivatives from a physics point of view. I am faced with this question: the edge of a square is being enlarged at $ 
2 \frac{cm}{sec}$ . What is the rate of change of the area when the edge is 6 cm long. The solution in the book (Serge Lang, A first course in Calculus, 5th ed) is as follows: $A = x^2 \\
\frac{dA}{dx} = 2x$ Using chain rule: $ \frac{dA} {dt} =\frac{dA} {dx} * \frac{dx} {dt} \\
= 2x * 2 = 4x $ When the edge is 6: $\frac{dA}{dt} = 4*6 = 24$ . My main issue is that intuitively I had assume I can do the following: At time $t_1, A_1 = x^2$ $\\ $ At time $t_1+1, A_2 = (x+2)(x+2) =
x^2 + 4x + 4$ Then $\frac {dA}{dt}= \frac{A_2 - A_1} {t_1 +1 - t_1} = 4x+4$ Which does not match the answer, also, calculating difference of area when edge goes from 4 to 6 is 36 - 16 = 20 and not 24. I would like to understand what was wrong in my logic. Also I considered this might be due to the fact that I am taking a long interval ( 1 sec. and derivatives evaluate the rate of change at exactly the point of change). But again the rate which we are using is defined as 2 $\frac {cm}{sec}$ ,we don't have any information about how it grows in shorter intervals, so I don't know if it make sense to think of shorter intervals than 1 second. When I googled about derivates from definition are different from formulas I came against something called backward and forward differences and centered differences, it seems to be related to discrete mathematics which I have no experience with yet. But using the idea to evaluate the derivate at the center yields: $(x+1)(x+1) - (x-1)(x-1) = 4x$ This also is correct as difference between 49 and 25.
Maybe someone can shade light on this?
(I guess same result can be reached if we take two differences, one forward and one backward and average them on the time interval of 2 second). Also one final remark that confused me, the fact I can evaluate the area when $x = 5$ and $x = 6$ is based on the initial condition of the length of the edge. That is, is not there a hidden assumption that the increase is uniform everywhere during this one second? What I mean to point out is that if the edge was being increased in pulses and not uniformly then I can not assume that $x-1$ and $x+1$ (despite having a distance of 2 separating them) are actually legal to evaluate, because the only information I was given that $x_{next } = x_{old} + 2$ for every second that passes Thanks.","['calculus', 'area', 'derivatives']"

In a 3D sphere, let's start from an initial point located at coordinates $(1, 0, 0)$ , where each element corresponds to the $(x, y, z)$ coordinates in the plane. Our only allowed actions are rotating the point around either the $X + Z$ or $-X + Z$ axis (the axis of rotations would be $(X+Z)/\sqrt{2}$ and $(-X + Z)/\sqrt{2}$ respectively. They are vector addition of $X$ and $Z$ and $-X$ and $Z$ ). The total rotation amount (i.e. the total angle of rotation) must be equal to $\theta ~ (< \pi)$ . What is the optimal strategy in order to minimize the Euclidean distance between the final point and the initial point? Upon numerical investigation, it appears that rotating by an angle of $\theta/2$ around the $X + Z$ axis, followed by an additional rotation of $\theta/2$ around the $-X + Z$ axis, gives the optimal solution for this problem.

Since b is the largest sum of all possible subsequences, it includes all elements and equal $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i = S$ . To get the smallest element, you need to take the smallest terms from sequense, since by condition the series converges,that $\lim_{n\to \infty}x_n=0$ .This means that to get a we can take terms tending to zero,a= $0$ .P=( $0$ ,S).

Evaluating $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin z}{z - i} = \Im \left( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^{i z}}{z - i} \right) \, ,$$ I express this as a closed semi-circular contour of radius $R$ in the upper-half plane and take $\lim R \to \infty$ . By Jordan's lemma, the integral over the arc contour vanishes and we can evaluate the integral by the residue theorem $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin z}{z - i} = \Im \left( 2 \pi i \, \left. \mathrm{Res}\left( 
\frac{e^{i z}}{z - i} \right) \right|_{z = i} \right) = \frac{2 \pi}{e} \, ,$$ while the correct answer is $\pi / e$ . I've stared at this for a bit and still cannot see what I've done wrong. Can anyone quickly point out how the factor of 2 cancels?","['complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"
4780014,Diophantine equation with 1 and 3,"In a certain exercise I am asked to say how many possible solutions are there for the diophantine equation $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_{20} = 50$ , with the condition that $x_i$ can only be or 1 or 3. Here is my attempt: To begin with, one has to choose how many 3 can be. Taking into account that there are at most 20 $x_i$ that can add up to the number on the right side and that those $x_i$ can only be 1, I ended up with the fact that the only possible solution would be having 15 threes and therefore the sum of the remaining 5 members would be 5, so the remaining members would all be 1. The only thing missing is ordering those threes: the answer is therefore $20 \choose 15$ . Is this correct, or am I missing something?","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
4780026,Is $A \leq B$ with probability $p>1/2$ a partial order on random variables?,"It seems reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. My mathematics training is limited though and I would love proof or contradiction. A quick search turns up many references cataloging on stochastic orderings - e.g. stochastic dominance, hazard rate order, etc. None so far seems to mention this most basic one though. Is the relation defined as $(A,B) \in \leq_q$ if $p(A  \leq B) \geq q$ a partial order too? I feel like it should be - at least for $q>1/2$ , and maybe assuming something about the dependence between any pair $A,B$ ? - but need help to prove it.","['order-theory', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
4780029,"$\mathbf{P}(S_{n(i)}=i \mid S_1=i),\mathbf{P}(S_{n(i)+1}=i\mid S_1=i),......$ are zeros?","$\left\{\xi_{n}\right\}_{n\in\ \mathbb{N}_{+}}$ is a sequence of independently and identically distributed random variables, each taking a finite number of integer values. $\mathbf{E}(\xi_1)\ne 0,$ For any $n\in \mathbb{N}_{+},$ define $S_{n}:=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\xi_{i}.$ Show that $\left\{S_{n}\right\}_{n\in\ \mathbb{N}_{+}}$ is a Markov chain, with each state being transient. My question is how to prove whose each state is transient.I attempt to demonstrate $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathbf{P}(S_{n}=i\mid S_1=i)<\infty $ for each $i$ in the state space $S$ , by Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers and  Borel–Cantelli lemma. Maybe we can use this equivalence $$\frac{S_n}{n} \xrightarrow[]{a.s.}\mathbf{E}(\xi_1)\Longleftrightarrow \displaystyle \lim_{ n\to \infty}\mathbf{P}\left(\bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty}\left\{\left|\frac{S_k}{k} -\mathbf{E}(\xi_1)\right|\ge\varepsilon\right\}\right)=0, \forall \varepsilon>0.$$ to create a paradox to support that starting from some positive integer $n(i)$ , all subsequent terms in $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathbf{P}(S_{n}=i\mid S_1=i)$ i.e. $\mathbf{P}(S_{n(i)}=i\mid S_1=i),\mathbf{P}(S_{{n(i)+1}}=i\mid S_1=i),......$ are zeros. $\left\{S_{n}\right\}_{n\in\ \mathbb{N}_{+}}$ is a time-homogeneous Markov chain.
Someone have objections, and the reasons are as follows: From Chapman-Kolmogorov equation , $k+m$ -step transition probability \begin{align}
   \mathbf{P}(S_{n+k+m}=j\mid S_{n}=j)&=:\mathbf{P}^{(k+m)}(j,j)\\ &=\sum_{r\in S}\mathbf{P}^{(k)}(j,r)\cdot\mathbf{P}^{(m)}(r,j) \\
&\ge\mathbf{P}^{(k)}(j,j)\cdot\mathbf{P}^{(m)}(j,j).\end{align} If both $\mathbf{P}^{(k)}(j,j)>0$ and $\mathbf{P}^{(m)}(j,j)>0$ , then $\mathbf{P}^{(k+m)}(j,j)>0.$ That will lead to $\mathbf{P}(S_{n+k+m}=j)>0,$ further steps will result in infinitely many $\mathbf{P}(S_{n}=j)>0.$ What is your opinion on this? I thought from the definition of time-homogeneous, $\mathbf{P}(S_{n+1}=j|S_{n}=i)=\mathbf{P}(S_{m+1}=j|S_{m}=i),\forall i,j\in S \& \forall n,m\in \mathbb{N},$ both $\mathbf{P}(S_{n})>0$ and $\mathbf{P}(S_{m})>0$ seem to be needed.","['self-learning', 'markov-chains', 'stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
4780047,Principal components of Vandermonde matrix,"Recall that the Vandermonde matrix of a collection $\{x_0,\ldots,x_m\}$ of points is $$ V = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & x_0 & x_0^2 & \cdots & x_0^n \\
1 & x_1 & x_1^2 & \cdots & x_1^n \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_m & x_m^2 & \cdots & x_m^n \end{pmatrix} $$ Take your points to be uniformly spread out over the interval $[-1, 1]$ , with step sizes $2/m$ . Now use SVD to extract the first $r$ principal components of $V$ . Numerical analysis suggests that the principal components stabilize as $m$ and $n$ tend to $\infty$ . Below I plot the case $r = 5$ , $m = 20\,000$ , $n = 1000$ to illustrate. Is there a name for these functions?","['calculus', 'linear-algebra', 'statistics', 'numerical-methods']"
