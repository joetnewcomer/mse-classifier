410230,Algorithm for finding orientation of each face on a polyhedron?,"I am working on making a dice rolling application and I need to find out how far in each of the three dimensions I must rotate each of the dice to make the correct side face the camera so the user can see what the result of each roll was. I can easily do this with two dimensional figures, but three dimensional polyhedrons seem to be much more difficult. I guess I am just going about it the wrong way, but here is what I thought I could do. I know the center of each of the dice will always be (0, 0, 0), so I thought I could just find the centroid of each face and project a line through it. The line would be about 2.0 units in length. I was thinking of forming a triangle with that line and a line from the camera to the center of the die as well, then I could use simple trigonometry to find the angles that I need. My problem with this method is that, while it works with 90º angles, I need the angles before the calculations in order to find the length of the hypotenuse. Obviously, if I had those angles I could skip this all together. So, that leaves me with no ideas. I do not have any idea what to do here, so I would like to request your help. So, is there any way to find the number of degrees a line must be rotated to become parallel to another line?","['geometry', '3d', 'rotations', 'trigonometry', 'quaternions']"

410263,Geometric way to view the truncated braid groups?,"This is perhaps a vague question, but hopefully there exists literature on the subject. The question is motivated by an answer I gave to this question . I also asked a related question on MO , although hopefully this question should be easier. There exists a rather remarkable relationship between the 5 platonic solids, and the factor groups of the $n$-string braid groups $B_n$ by adjoining the relation $\sigma_i^k=1$ (here the $\sigma_i$, $1\leq i\leq n-1$ are the usual generators of $B_n$). We'll call these groups $B_n(k)$ the truncated braid groups of type $(n,k)$ where $B_n(k)=B_n/\langle \sigma_i^k\rangle$. Theorem *: For $n\geq 3$, the group $B_n(k)$ is finite if and only if $k=2$ or $(n,k)$ is the Schläfli type of one of the 5 platonic solids. For these cases, $$|B_n(k)|=\left(\frac{f(n,k)}{2}\right)^{n-1}n!$$ where $f(n,k)$ is the number of faces of the platonic solid of type $(n,k).$ The 5 platonic solids correspond to the pairs $(n,k)\in\{(3,3),(3,4),(4,3),(3,5),(5,3)\}$. This is equivalent to the pair $(n,k)$ being a solution to the inequality $$\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{k}>\frac{1}{2}.$$ *It appears that this theorem was proved by Coxeter in H. S. M. Coxeter, Factor groups of the braid group , Proceedings of the Fourth Can. Math. Cong., Banff 1957, University of Toronto Press (1959), 95–122. although it is proving difficult for me to find a copy of this online or in my institution's library. From what I can gather, the proof is rather algebraic/combinatorial, although without access to a copy I can't say for sure. My question is: Question Can one view the finite truncated braid groups in a geometric way as some action (in the vague, not necessarily strict group-action, sense) on the corresponding platonic solid or related objects? Some of the approaches I have taken have included: considering the isometry group on the corresponding solid (group orders don't match up), considering paths on the surface which 'remember' the side that a face was entered from (relations don't match up), considering labellings of the edges of the faces of the solid so that no face has a pair of edges with the same label, with group elements being permutations of edges which preserve this property (not sure if order matches up - seems difficult to calculate but may be the best approach so far), considering 'rolling' the solid along a surface until it reaches its starting point again (no obvious way of making this a group via some kind of homotopy ) It seems that there should be some nice geometric interpretation of these groups, especially as every face has $n$ edges and every vertex is shared by $k$ faces. It would be especially nice if the usual generators can be realised in a nice geometric way. Ultimately it would be nice to extend such a geometric interpretation of these finite truncated braid groups to the infinite cases as well (which correspond to regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane in most cases, and the complex plane in the case $(n,k)\in\{(3,6),(4,4),(6,3)\}$).","['knot-theory', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'group-actions', 'braid-groups', 'group-theory']"
410266,Preimage of a maximal ideal.,"My textbook says that if $f: R \rightarrow S$ is a ring homomorphism, where $R$ and S are commutative; then if $P$ is a maximal ideal of $S$ , it might not necessarily be a maximal ideal of $R$ . A counterexample is if we choose $R = \Bbb{Z}$ , $S = \Bbb{Q}$ , and let $f$ be the inclusion map. However, when I try to ""prove"" that the preimage must also be maximal, my proof makes sense to me. I know that I must be doing something wrong in the proof, but I couldn't really see it. ""Proof"" Define $g: S \rightarrow S/P$ with kernel $P$ . Let $h = g \circ f: R \rightarrow S/P$ . Since $h$ is a ring homomorphism, the kernel is an ideal of $R$ . Also, from the first isomorphism theorem, we know that $R/\ker(h) \cong S/P$ . Since $P$ is a maximal ideal of $S$ , we know that $S/P$ is a field. Since $R/\ker(h)$ is isomorphic to $S/P$ , it must also be a field, which implies that the kernel of $R$ (which is the preimage of $P$ ) is a maximal ideal of $R$ .

410280,Lebesgue measure as a fixpoint: change of variables formulas,"This question is inspired by several others on a similar topic: see e.g. this one and a sequence of linked questions. Let us so far focus on $\Bbb R^n$ endowed with standard Borel structure. For any map $\phi\in \mathcal C^1(\Bbb R^n,\Bbb R^n)$ we have the following formula for the change of variables in the integral
$$
  \int_{\phi(\Omega)}f\;\mathrm d\lambda = \int_\Omega (f\circ\phi)\;|\phi'|\mathrm d\lambda \tag{1}
$$
where $\Omega$ is any Borel set, $f$ is any Borel and bounded, $\phi'$ is the Jacobian of $\phi$ and $\lambda$ is the $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure on $\Bbb R^n$. On the other hand, for any Borel measure $\mu$ the following formula applies
$$
  \int_\Omega (f\circ\phi)\;\mathrm d\mu = \int_{\phi(\Omega)}f\;\mathrm d(\phi_*\mu) \tag{2}.
$$
where $(\phi_*\mu)(A) = \mu(\phi^{-1}(A))$ is the pushforward measure. As a result, provided the fact that
$
  \frac{\mathrm d\mu}{\mathrm d\lambda} = |\phi'|
$
we obtain for any admissible $\Omega$ and $f$ that
$$
  \int_{\phi(\Omega)}f\;\mathrm d\lambda = \int_{\phi(\Omega)}f\;\mathrm d(\phi_*\mu)
$$
which implies that $\lambda|_{\phi(\Omega)} = (\phi_*\mu)|_{\phi(\Omega)}$. Moreover, if $\phi(\Omega) = \Bbb R^n$ then $\lambda = \phi_*\mu$. Let $\mathcal P(\Bbb R^n)$ be the set of all Borel measures on $\Bbb R^n$, and for any $\phi\in \mathcal C^1(\Bbb R^n,\Bbb R^n)$ with the range $\Bbb R^n$ let us define an operator $\phi'$ on $\mathcal P(\Bbb R^n)$ given by $\mathrm d\phi'(\mu) := |\phi'|\mathrm d\mu.$ As a result, from the discussion above we obtain that $\lambda$ solves the equation
$$
  \phi_*(\phi'(\mu)) = \mu \tag{3}.
$$
for any such $\phi$. Clearly, for some $\phi$ there may be multiple solution: e.g. if $\phi =\mathrm{id}_{\Bbb R^n}$ then $\phi_*\circ \phi' = \mathrm{id}_{\mathcal P(\Bbb R^n)}$ so that any $\mu$ satisfies $(3)$ in this case. Q1: Is that true, that $\lambda$ is the only positive measure (up to scaling) that satisfies $(3)$ for all $\phi$ that range over $\Bbb R^n$? Q2: If such a measure is not unique, what similar properties do they have? Perhaps, it has to be equivalent to the Lebesgue measure. Q3: Is there a ""characteristic"" map $\hat\phi$ such that if $\mu$ satisfies $(3)$ for $\hat\phi$, then it satisfies it for all $\phi$? Q4: Is there any intuitive reason, why the Lebesgue measure satisfies this equation? P.S. Feel free to fix my notation (especially $\phi'$ as an operator), or comment for which $\Omega$, $f$ and $\phi$ formulas above are well-defined - I didn't have a chance to study geometric measure theory. I hope that the current formulation may shed some light on the similarities between two different formulas for the change of coordinates, which are not clear to me at the moment.
Also, I know that similar formulas for the change of coordinates are available for smooth manifolds endowed e.g. with Hausdorff measures, so perhaps this feature applies not only to the Lebesgue measure, but to $n$-dimensional Hausdorff measures as well. Another consequence of $(1)$ and $(2)$ is that for any $\mathcal C^1$-bijection $\phi$ it holds that
$$
  \frac{\mathrm d(\phi_*\lambda)}{\mathrm d\lambda} = |(\phi^{-1})'|\circ\phi^{-1}.

Is anyone familiar with a method of fitting data that provides a monotonic function that passes through the middle of a set of points, rather than each point individually?

410320,probability of sum of two integers less than an integer,"Two integers [not necessarily distinct] are chosen from the set {1,2,3,...,n}. What is the probability that their sum is <=k? My approach is as follows. Let a and b be two integers. First we calculate the probability of the sum of a+b being equal to x [1<=x<=n]. WLOG let a be chosen first. For b= x-a to be positive, we must have 1<=a < x. This gives (x-1) possible values for a out of total n possible values. Probability of valid selection of a= (x-1)/n. For each valid selection of a, we have one and only one possible value of b. Only 1 value of b is then valid out of total n possible values. Thus probability of valid selection of b= 1/n. Thus probability of (a+b= x) = (x-1)/n(n-1). Now probability of (a+b<=k)
= Probability of (a+b= 2) + probability of (a+b= 3) + ... + probability of (a+b= k)

410337,"Measurability of number of upcrossing $U_I(\alpha,\beta; X)$ in continuous time","These definitions come from Karatzas and Shreve, Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus . We may take for granted that $U_F(\alpha,\beta; X(\omega))$, the number of upcrossings over $[\alpha,\beta]$ of the stochastic process $\{X_t \in \mathbb{R}, t \geq 0\}$ on the finite set $F$, is measurable as a function of $\omega$. Then if $I\subseteq [0,\infty)$ is not necessarily finite, we define
$$
U_I(\alpha,\beta; X(\omega)) := \sup\{U_F(\alpha,\beta; X(\omega)); F \subseteq I, F \text{ is finite} \}.

The authors make the comment that ""Being the limit of random variables of the form $U_F(\alpha,\beta; X(\omega))$ with finite $F$, $U_{[\sigma,\tau]}(\alpha,\beta; X(\omega))$ is measurable."" This statement is apparently false as the sequence of finite $F_n$'s one chooses for the limit must depend on $\omega$. However, (deary me I hope!) the conclusion is still true.
How can we show that $U_I(\alpha,\beta; X(\omega))$ is measurable? If $X_t$ is RCLL or if one makes a similar continuity assumption then I think the result follows by restricting to $\mathbb{Q}$, but I do not want to make any extra assumptions on $X$ other than that it is a real valued stochastic process, i.e. $X_t$ is $\mathscr{F}/\mathscr{B}(\mathbb{R})$-measurable for all $t\geq 0$.

410522,"Fold, Gather, Cut","Here's a mathematical puzzle I've been thinking about.  Let's say you have a strip of fabric, of length $N$ units ($N$ being an integer), which has regular markings on it every 1 unit along its length.  Your task is to cut the fabric into $N$ lengths of 1 unit each, but to do so using the fewest operations possible.  The operations available to you are: Cut - you may cut through any number of overlapping layers in a single operation.  All cuts must be through the 1-unit markings on the fabric, and the cut must be in a straight line.  (No using a wavy cut to do the whole thing in 1 operation.) Gather - you may gather any number of already-cut lengths together in a bundle.  They must all line up on one end.  (If they are the same lengths, they will of course line up on both ends.) Fold - You may fold any number of layers of fabric in either direction.  Multiple folds can only be counted as 1 operation if the places to be folded are already lined up, either via a previous Gather or another Fold step.  Unlike Cuts, a Fold may occur between the 1-unit markings.  Unfolding does not require an additional operation. Now it can be trivially shown that for any $N$ which is $2^k$, an ideal solution would be to have $k$ Cuts alternating with $k-1$ Gathers, for a total of $2k - 1$ operations.  This is by no means the only ideal solution.  For example, consider $N=8$.  The steps could be: Cut into 2 lengths of 4. Gather lengths. Cut into 4 lengths of 2. Gather lengths. Cut into 8 lengths of 1. Or you could do the following: Fold at the 3rd marking. Fold at the 5th marking the other direction. Cut down the middle to get 4 lengths of 2 (2 of which are folded). Gather lengths. Cut into 8 lengths of 1. Still 5 steps either way.  It gets trickier when you consider other numbers however.  Say, for $N=9$, you could take any $N=8$ solution, and then add 1 more cut for that last piece that will be 1 unit too long.  But you can do 9 in 5 steps as well: Fold in half. Cut at the 3rd and 6th markings (which should be lined up) to get 3 lengths of 3. Gather lengths. Fold all 3 in half again. Cut into 9 lengths of 1. So my question is, with the given operations, can you compute the minimum number of operations for any given $N$?",['combinatorics']

410729,Singleton subset of a metric space,"I am currently working through chapter two of Principles of Mathematical Analysis (ed. 3) by Walter Rudin. My question comes from pages 30-31. I know that a metric space must satisfy the definition: Definition: A metric space is an ordered pair, $(X,d)$, where $X$ is a set (whose elements are called points), and $d$ is a metric. The metric must satisfy the following, given $x,y,z \in X$: (a): $d(x,y) \ge 0$ (b): $d(x,y) = 0$ iff $x=y$ (c): $d(x,y) =d(y,x)$ (d): $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$ Rudin then provides the example that euclidean spaces, $\mathbb{R}^k$ are also metric spaces. Following, he then specifies that any subset of a metric space is also a metric space. After proving this statement, I then decided to come up with examples, and as an exercise, try to challenge myself to come up with counter-examples. One attempt that I made was: $\{ \boldsymbol{x} \} \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ where $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a $k$-tuple. This provides the conjecture: Conjecture: Given any $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^k$, the set $\{ \boldsymbol{x} \} \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ is a metric space. Proof: $d(x,x) = |x - x| = |0| = 0$. Therefore, the only possible metric is $0$ and hence all the definition's conditions are satisfied. I am uneasy about the proof I have constructed because in the definition, two (and once three) elements are drawn from the metric space. So in order for the above to hold, I essentially need to give this element several times. So the primary substance of my question is: in a metric space, can we let an element ""do two jobs at once?""","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

411018,Can I use l'Hôpital to find a limit after changing to polar coordinates?,"I was wondering if there is another approach instead of using the $log (x + 1) \sim_{0} x$ or Taylor series to solve: $$\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} f(x,y)={\ln(xy + 1) \over x}.$$ Particularly, I'm wondering whether I can use polar coordinates and l'Hopital. Something like this. First, we switch to polar coordinates: $$\lim_{(r) \to (0)} f(r)={\ln(r^2\cos\phi \sin\phi + 1) \over r\cos \phi}.$$ Now we use l'Hopital: \begin{align}
&\lim_{(r) \to (0)} f(r)=\lim_{(r) \to (0)}{\ln(r^2\cos\phi \sin\phi + 1) \over r\cos \phi}
\\
=&\lim_{(r) \to (0)}{{d\over dr}(\ln(r^2\cos\phi \sin\phi + 1) \over{d\over dr} (r\cos \phi)}
\\
=&\lim_{(r) \to (0)}{2r\sin\phi \cos\phi \over {r^2\sin\phi \cos^2\phi + \cos\phi}}
\\
=&\lim_{(r) \to (0)}{2r\sin\phi \over r^2\sin\phi \cos\phi +1}=0.
\end{align} As $$\lim_{(r) \to (0)} f(\phi)= {2r\sin\phi }= 0.$$ Does this make any sense at all or I can't use l'hopital in this case?","['multivariable-calculus', 'limits']"
411045,Topology of pointwise convergence and point-open topology are equivalent,"Definition VII.1. In Nagata's Modern General Topology construct Topology of pointwise convergence as follows: Given $x_1,\cdots,x_n\in X$ and $O_1,\cdots, O_n\in \mathcal{T}_Y$, let $$[x_1,\cdots,x_n;O_1,\cdots, O_n]=\{f\in C(X,Y): f(x_i)\in O_i\}\;.$$
  Then the family $$PC(X, Y)=\{U\subset C(X, Y) : \text{for any } f \in U
\text{ we have }f \in [x_1,\cdots,x_n;O_1,\cdots, O_n]\subset  U \text{ for some } n\in \Bbb N, x_1,\cdots,x_n\in X \text{ and } O_1,\cdots, O_n\in \mathcal{T}_Y\}$$
  is called the topology of pointwise convergence on the set $C(X, Y)$. 1) $PC(X,Y)$ is a topology or a base for a topology on $C(X,Y)$? The other references are defined point-open topology on $C(X)$ as follows: Let $\Bbb F(X)$ denote the set of all finite subset of $X$. for $A\in \Bbb F(X)$ and an open set $V$ of $\Bbb R$, define $[A,V]=\{f\in C(X): f(A)\subseteq V\}$. The collection $\{[A,V]:A\in\Bbb F(X), V\text{ open in }\Bbb R\}$ forms a subbase for the point-open topology on $C(X)$. 2) Do these two definitions are equivalent?",['general-topology']
411058,Evaluate the integral $\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(1+x^2)\cosh{(ax)}}dx$,"The problem is : Evaluate the integral $$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(1+x^2)\cosh{(ax)}}dx$$ I have tried expand $\frac{1}{\cosh{ax}}$ and give the result in the following way: First, note that $$\frac{1}{\cosh{(ax)}}=\frac{2e^{-ax}}{e^{-2ax}+1}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}2(-1)^n e^{-(2n+1)ax}$$
    Secondly, we consider $f(a)=\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{ax}}{1+x^2}dx$ Some calculation results in $f''(a)+f(a)=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{ax}dx=-\frac{1}{a}$ We substitute $f(a)=u(a)e^{ia}$ into former result and thus $ (u'(a) e^{2ia})'=-\frac{e^{ia}}{a}.$ Let $E(a)=\int_{0}^{a} \frac{e^{it}}{t}dt=\mbox{Ei}(ia)$ where $\mbox{Ei}(x)$ is the Exponential integral then $$u'(a)= -e^{-2ia} E(a)+c_1 e^{-2ia}.$$ Hence  \begin{align*}u(a) &=\frac{1}{2i} e^{-2ia}E(a) - \frac{1}{2i}\int_{0}^{a} \frac{e^{-it}}{t}dt-\frac{1}{2i}c_1 e^{-2ia} +c_2
\\ &=\frac{1}{2i} e^{-2ia}E(a) -\frac{1}{2i}E(-a)-\frac{1}{2i}c_1 e^{-2ia} +c_2\end{align*}
    We conclude that $$ f(a)=\frac{e^{-ia} \mbox{Ei}(ia)-e^{ia}\mbox{Ei}(-ia)}{2i}+c_1 e^{-ia}+c_2 e^{ia}$$ But I got stuck here, I cannot figure out $c_1$ as well as $c_2$. Also, even $c_1$ and $c_2$ are known, I cannot use the summation to get result for the original question. Is there other way to tackle this problem? Or can I modify my method to make it feasible to get the desired result? Thanks for your attention!","['definite-integrals', 'improper-integrals', 'integration']"
