1195297,"Integrate $\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x^a)}{1+x}\, dx$","I have recently met with this integral:
$$\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x^a)}{1+x}\, dx$$ I want to evaluate it in a closed form, if possible. 1st functional equation: $\displaystyle f(a)=\ln^2 2-f\left ( \frac{1}{a} \right )$ since:
$$\begin{aligned}
f(a)=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln (1+x^a)}{1+x}\,dx &= \int_{0}^{1}\ln \left ( 1+x^a \right )\left ( \ln (1+x) \right )'\,dx\\
&= \ln^2 2 - \int_{0}^{1}\frac{ax^{a-1}\ln (1+x)}{1+x^a}\,dx\\
&\overset{y=x^a}{=\! =\! =\!}\ln^2 2 - \int_{0}^{1}\frac{a y^{(a-1)/a}\ln \left ( 1+y^{1/a} \right )}{1+y}\frac{1}{a}y^{(1-a)/a}\,dy \\
&= \ln^2 2 -f\left ( \frac{1}{a} \right )
\end{aligned}$$ 2nd functional equation: $\displaystyle f(a)=-\frac{a\pi^2}{12}+f(-a)$ since: $$\begin{aligned}
f(a)=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln (1+x^a)}{1+x}\,dx &=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln \left ( x^a\left ( 1+x^{-a} \right ) \right )}{1+x}\,dx \\
&= a\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln x}{1+x}\,dx+\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln (1+x^{-a})}{1+x}\,dx\\
&= a\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln x}{1+x}\,dx+f(-a)\\
&= a\int_{0}^{1}\ln x \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n x^n \,dx +f(-a)\\
&= a\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n \int_{0}^{1}\ln x \cdot x^n \,dx +f(-a)\\ 
&=\cdots\\
&=-\frac{a\pi^2}{12}+f(-a)
\end{aligned}$$ What I did try was: 1st way $$\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log(1+x^a)}{1+x}\,dx &=\int_{0}^{1}\log(1+x^a)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n x^n\,dx \\
&= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n \int_{0}^{1}\log(1+x^a)x^n\,dx\\
&= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n  \{ \left[ \frac{x^{n+1}\log(1+x^a)}{n+1} \right]_0^1- \\
& \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \frac{a}{n+1}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{n+1}x^{a-1}}{1+x^a}\,dx  \}
\end{aligned}$$ 2nd way I tried IBP but I get to an unpleasant integral of the form $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{1}\frac{\ln(1+x)x^{a-1}}{1+x^a}\,dx$. 3nd way It was just an idea ... expand the nominator into Taylor Series , swip integration and summation and get into a digamma form . This way suggests that a closed form is far away ... since we are dealing with digammas here. The result I got was:
$$\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{1+x}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}x^{ak} &=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{ak}}{1+x}dx  \\ 
 &= 1/2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\left[\psi\left(\frac{ak}{2}+1\right)-\psi\left(\frac{ak}{2}+1/2\right)\right] \\ 
\end{aligned}$$
and I can't go on.","['analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'special-functions']"

Show that F is a σ-algebra of Ω Consider P: F → [0,1]. If A is uncountable P(A) = 1 and if A is countable P(A) = 0. Is P a probability measure? I think that for this problem I just have to prove that the conditions for a σ-algebra is valid for 1) and Kolmogorov axioms are valid for 2). However, I'm having a lot of trouble with countable (and uncountable) sets properties. For example, if A is countable, $A^c$ may be countable or uncountable, right? At the moment I have the following: 1) i) F is non-empty. This is true, since A is in F ii) F is Closed under complementation. I'm not sure on how to work A and $A^c$ in this iii) F is Closed under countable unions. 2) i) P>= 0. This is true, it can only be 0 or 1. ii) P(Ω) = 1. Also true, do I need to prove this? iii) P(Union of all the sets) = ∑ P(each set) if they are disjoint. I'm not sure on how to prove this one. Sorry for all the questions.

1195328,The Set of Functions satisfying $\int_{D}\vert f(z)\vert (1-\vert z\vert)^2dA(z)\le 1$ is a Normal Family,"Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of holomorphic functions on the unit disc so that for any $f\in \mathcal{F}$ one has $$\int_{D}\vert f(z)\vert (1-\vert z\vert)^2dA(z)\le 1$$
  Prove $\mathcal{F}$ is a normal family. I have also seen a similar problem where the integral was $\int_{D}\vert f \vert^2dA(z)$. I am looking for a solution that can can used in both of these examples. The only technique that comes to mind is the following: Montel's Theorem: If $U\subset \mathbb{C}$ is an open set and $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of holomorphic functions on $U$ that is bounded on compact sets, then there is a sequence ${f_n}\subset \mathcal{F}$ that converges normally in $U$. Attempt: For each $n$ let $g_n(z)=\int_{D}\vert f_n(z)\vert (1-\vert z \vert )^2dA(z)$. Then $g_n$ is bounded by $1$ on any compact subset of $D$. So by Montel's Theorem and continuity of the integral, $g_n$ converges normally to some $\int_{D}\vert g(z)\vert (1-\vert z \vert)^2dA(z)$. Hence $f_n$ converges normally to $g$. Am I on the right track? For the example $\int_{D}\vert f \vert^2 dA(z)$, I am not sure if this method suffices since the hint is to use Cauchy inequalities to show that $\vert f \vert ^2$ does not exceed the mean value of $\vert f\vert ^2$ on a small disc centered at $z$.","['normal-families', 'complex-analysis', 'uniform-convergence']"

1195370,Pole and removable sigularity,"I try to solve the following problem. I do not sure how to begin : Let $f$ be a holomorphic function on $\mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\}$. Assume that there exists a constant $C > 0$ and a real constant $M$ such that $$|f(z)| \leq C|z|^M$$ for $0 < |z| < \frac{1}{2}.$ Show that $z=0$ is either a pole or a removable singularities for $f$, and find sharp bound for $O_0(f)$, the order of $f$ at $0$ (I think that the order means the of $z$ in $f(z)$. I think that $f$ might should take the form $f(z) = \frac{g(z)}{z^{O_0(f)}}$ where $g$ is entire.) I am not sure I should if I should write $f := \frac{g}{z^n}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ where $g$ is entire.(I have no particular reasons for writing $f$ in this form except that the most of the questions ask about poles or singularity of $f$, $f$ is often written in this form) I guess that the condition, $|f(z)| \leq C|z|^M$ for $0 < |z| < \frac{1}{2}$, might connect to that $f$ is a polynmial of degree at most $M$ on $0 < |z| < \frac{1}{2}$, but it seems that this contradict the form $f = g/ z^n$.

1195409,Permutations to satisfy a challenging restriction,"In a stack of n distinct cards in order {1,2,3,4,...,n} from top, define distance between 2
  cards as the number of cards between them.
  2 cards are neighbours if they're adjacent in original stack, if their index differs by 1. How many card rearrangements (permutations) satisfy the following? I) The sum of distances between any card and its 
  neighbour/s (call that sum $S_n$ for card $n$), is distinct for all $n$
  cards. II) $S_n$ is distinct for all $n$ and only take on values smaller than $n$. Edit 1 : an example makes the conditions clearer. Say we have 3 cards in original stack in order 1,2,3 from top. Rearrange cards into order 2,3,1 from top. Then: Card 1 is distance 1 from its former neighbour card 2. $S_1$=1 Card 2 is distance 1 to card 1 but distance 0 to card 3. $S_2$=1+0=1 Card 3 is distance 0 from card 2. $S_3$=0 Hence this reordering/shuffle does not satisfy the conditions in the question, as both $S_1$ and $S_2$ are 1. Edit 2 : JLee and LaBird kindly wrote programs to generate data(thanks so much!). Using the data I did a quick plot to guess possible relationships between n and the ratio of permutations satisfying condition 1 in respect to the total number of permutations of length n. This is a less than scientific approach, but in the spirit of contribution, i hope this can 'trigger' ways to solve the problem. Brief comment: It appears that the slope of the log plot is stabilising to around -1/2, though this is a pure guess without more data. My attempt: I made a list of basic observations, trying to link this problem to known methods, but to little success. i)  Let original order of cards be 1,2,3,4…..,n for simplicity from top of stack . After the order of the cards are randomized, the distance between cards 2 and 3 will contribute to both S2 and S3, as they were neighbours before. ii) The question is analogous to a frog making n-1 leaps on a 1*n board, labelled 1,2,3,4…..n from left to right. Starting on the square representing the new position of card 1, the frog makes leaps so that on the mth turn, the it is on the square representing the new position of the mth card. The restrictions are that every square must be covered exactly once and the magnitude of the first and last leaps, and the sum of the magnitudes of any 2 consecutive leaps must be distinct. iii)    Cards 1 and n have only 1 neighbour, so after rearranging, S1 and Sn are the distances between card 1 and its former neighbour and card n and its former neighbour, respectively. iv) In part i) Sn can take on any value from 0 to 2n-5. If a card k stays adjacent to its neighbours, then Sk=0. If Sn>n-3 for some n, then we can deduce that the former neighbouring cards are now both above or both below card n Sn reaches a maximum value of 2n-5 when a card is on the bottom of the deck and its two former neighbours at the top of the deck. Only n of those values need to be used so n-4 will remain unused. v)  For part ii), Sn can take on only values from 0 to n-1. Hence every value must be taken once. This means exactly one card k must remain next to all of its former neighbors in the new arrangement. This is done so Sk can take on the value 0. I’m not sure if such an arrangement is even possible. vi) At n=4, there are exactly 4 possible values for Sn : (0,1,2,3). For every greater value of n, the possible values of Sn exceeds n. Are there existing strategies to analyze/tackle problems like this? Can this problem be solved for small n like n=5? thanks as always","['pattern-recognition', 'combinatorics', 'permutations']"

1195835,Does all formula defines a set?,"A formula is a prediction. ZF system says that any formula defines a subset in a set.

So, the truth value of some formula could be unknown, at least at the moment the formula is talked about. Does such a formula defines always a set ? For example, the Goldbach's conjecture G that says any even number bigger than 2 can be the sum of 2 primes. G is neither proved TRUE nor proved FALSE. So, its truth value is unknown till now. G can be written as a formula in ZF system (easier if +, * are defined in ZF before). The Fermat's grand theorem F was proved recently (less than 20 years). F can also be written as a formula in ZF.

The final result being this is good for any integer $n$, and the first part (already proved) was that 
$$T \text { normal } \iff \forall x\in H,\| T(x)\|=\|T^*(x)\|$$ So,  here's my attempt at a proof of part b: Since the operator norm is submultiplicative, we have $\|T^2\|\le \| T\| ^2$.
Then from a theorem in Kreyszig's Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications (Thm 3.94(e), page 198) we have 
$$\|TT^*\|=\|T\|^2$$,
and using submultiplicativity again, combined with them 3.92 (p 196) that states $\|T^*\|=\|T\|$, we have
$$\|T\|^2\le \|T\|\cdot \|T^*\|=\|T\|^2$$
hence $\|T^2\|=\|T\|^2$  as desired. Now, the problem is...none of theorems I have used require $T$ to be normal (Or the space to be complex).  Nor did I use part a.   So....either my proof is wrong,  or this statement actually holds for all bounded linear operators on any Hilbert space...which I doubt, so I think I made a mistake somewhere.

1196307,Converse of uniform boundedness principle,"The uniform boundedness principle says if we have a collection of bounded linear operators $\Gamma$ from a banach space $X$ into a normed vector space $Y$, which is pointwise bounded on $X$, i.e. $$\sup \{\|Tx\| : T \in \Gamma \} < \infty \, \forall x \in X,$$ then $\Gamma$ must be uniformly bounded, $$\sup \{\|T\| : T \in \Gamma \} < \infty.$$ Now, I wonder is there some kind of converse statement? So, if $X$ is a normed space and the following holds for every normed space $Y$: $$\Gamma \subset \mathcal{L}(X,Y) \text{ pointwise bounded on }X \Rightarrow \Gamma \text{ uniformly bounded},$$
where $\mathcal{L}(X,Y)$ is the space of bounded linear operators from $X$ to $Y$. Then does it follow that $X$ is a banach space? Edit: Or are there any partial converses? Edit 2: I think I need to clarify further. The converses I am looking are not of the form ""uniformly bounded $\Rightarrow$ pointwise bounded"". Instead we should have a space $X$, more general than a Banach Space, in which the uniform boundedness principle holds. So every pointwise bounded collection $\Gamma$ of linear bounded operators (into an arbitrary space $Y$) must be uniformly bounded. And this should then imply that $X$ is a Banach space. It's okay if the theorem requires more conditions, than just the uniform boundedness principle, on $X$ for the conclusion to hold.","['banach-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'normed-spaces']"

There is one thing confusing me, however:
For example on Wikipedia people are talking about the canonical bundle of a smooth divisor (in the linked article called $\omega_D$) and I am not sure what that is. I do understand how to define the canonical bundle of a complex manifold.
Therefore, I also understand how to define the canonical bundle of, say, a smooth hypersurface.
I also know that every hypersurface Y defines a divisor $D = \sum_i [Y_i]$, where $Y_i$ are the irreducible components. Given a smooth divisor $D = \sum_i a_i [Y_i]$ one could assign the hypersurface $Y = \bigcup_i Y_i$ to it and define $\omega_D = \omega_Y$.
But (like Huybrechts also writes in his book) this construction is clearly not very natural. It just doesn't seem to be right to me.

To handle complex eigenvalues, I've assumed that if this element does not converge to zero before a specified iteration_max, then the trailing $2 \times 2$ sub matrix contains two eigenvalues (which still may be real eigenvalues, I think, so I check for that). I apply a straight quadratic equation to that sub-matrix's characteristic polynomial to get its eigenvalues, and deflate the A matrix by two rows and columns, and iterate. Everything before this point seems to work when I implement it in code. Now, the problem is that the convergence is much too slow. I have to set the maximum iterations severely high in order to handle some of my test cases. So I went and read up on advanced QR tricks. One is to reduce the input matrix to upper Hessenberg form, which I believe I've done correctly through the transformation H = Hessenberg(A). However, for one of my test cases, this causes the required iterations to actually increase . That makes me scratch my head. More importantly, I tried to implement shifting, and this broke my algorithm. So I need to make sure I understand that. Let the shift S be defined as the last element on the main diagonal. Let I be defined as an appropriately sized identity matrix. Then, I do $QR(H_k - I * S_k)$ . And $H_{k+1} = R * Q + I * S_k$ . This causes my matrix to rapidly converge. Unfortunately, it also effectively zeroes the last element in the main diagonal of H in my test case, causing it to incorrectly report an eigenvalue near zero. What am I doing wrong? Edit: (please don't laugh at my little $4 \times 4$ matrix)

I can see that there are ways to construct a new function that is necessarily diverging slower than the original one. But then it struck me that it really feels like properties of an open set where there are no smallest element in $(0,\infty)$. So the question is this, is it possible to define recursively a function $f(x)$ such that $\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)\to\infty$ and 
$$
(\forall g(x) \neq f(x), \lim_{x\to\infty} g(x)\to\infty) \lim_{x\to\infty} {g(x)\over f(x)}\to\infty

For an example of a function defined recursively, consider
$$
f(x)={x^{1\over f(x)}\over ln(x)}

Let's say we have a 25 dimensional multivariate with a 25x25 covariance matrix formed by using an RBF kernel. We want one sample which would have 25 points. One way to do this is multiply the lower triangular matrix (from a cholesky decomposition) with a 25x1 vector of sampled points from a univariate guassian. Furthermore, the following shows the relationship when predicting f2 given f1. This intuitively makes sense to me and I verified that the calculations using the lower triangular matrix comes out to this.

I believe both the mean and variance of that point would be affected by f1, f2 as well as the covariances for those two points, but how exactly?

In particular, it is known that in $S_r$ , $r$ prime, is generated by a $2$ -cycle and an $r$ -cycle, so if one can find appropriate primes, one can use Dedekind's result to show quickly that a given polynomial of prime degree has full Galois group $S_5$ . This condition is rather limited, however, and this motivates the following question: Suppose we know the cycle types of some elements of a group $G \leq S_n$ . Under what conditions on those cycle types can we conclude that $G$ is actually the full group $S_n$ ? This line of thinking was motivated, by the way, by this question , which asks about the solvability of the polynomials $$p_n(x) := x^n - \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} x^k$$ that arise when studying the so-called $n$ -nacci sequences . Two of the answers there report CAS computations giving that the Galois group of $p_n$ is $S_n$ for $n \leq 12$ , and one speculates that that holds for all $n$ . For $n = 5$ , one can use the primes $q = 3, 5$ to show that the Galois group contains $2$ - and $5$ -cycles, and hence by the above fact $\text{Gal}(p_5) \cong S_5$ .

Observe that $D(\chi(S))= \sum_{i \in S} 2^{n-i}$ and the number of 1's in $\chi(S)= |S|$. Then if $A \cap B = \varnothing$, $$D(\chi(A))+ D(\chi(B)) = \sum_{i \in A} 2^{n-i} + \sum_{i \in B} 2^{n-i} = \sum_{i \in A \cup B} 2^{n-i} = D(\chi(A \cup B))$$ Then \begin{equation}

What i tried (a)The Wronskain is $te^t(t-2)$ and for it to be lineraly indepedent, the Wronskain not equals to $0$ hence $t$ lies in the interval $0<t<2$. (b) The answer to this part is $$x'=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\frac{2-2t}{t^2-2t}&\frac{t^2-2}{t^2-2t}\\\end{bmatrix}x$$. I know how to get the eigenvectors from the system of ODE. But now the question require me to work backwards.Im unsure how to do so  from the eigenvectors though. Could anyone explain. Thanks",['ordinary-differential-equations']
1197141,Do side-rational triangles of the same area admit side-rational dissections?,"Call a polygon side-rational if the lengths of all its sides are rational.  Call a dissection of a polygon side-rational if all of the polygons within the dissection are side-rational.  Then my question is as in the title: Do any two rational triangles of the same area have a common side-rational dissection? Of course it's a classical result that any two polygons of the same area have a common dissection; a standard proof goes through triangulating the polygons, using a triangle-to-rectangle dissection, partitioning the rectangles for both polygons into a set of common-area rectangles, and then using a rectangle-to-rectangle dissection.  But many of the steps in this process will involve non-rational sides (for instance, the rectangle corresponding to a triangle of rational sides but irrational area certainly can't have rational sides), and it's not clear that such a dissection could be patched up. This question was prompted by rediscovering my common dissection of two very special rational triangles, the $4-5-6$ triangle and the $3-8-10$ triangle (both of area $\frac{15}{4}\sqrt{7}$): All the lengths here can be shown straightforwardly with the law of sines and law of cosines; these triangles are a somewhat special case because so many of the angles involved are multiples of each other, but it seems likely that any rational triangle will inherently be special in somewhat similar ways. EDIT : the original version of this question asked about arbitrary polygons, but having thought about it more I would be amazed if that result is true.  The area of a (side-)rational triangle is always the square root of a rational number (by Heron's formula , for instance), but already rational-sided quadrilaterals can have arbitrary area: just imagine 'flexing' a rhombus with all sides of unit length, from a square down to a trivial, collapsed shape: it will continuously take on all areas from $1$ to $0$.  This implies, for instance, that there's a rhombus with all sides of unit length and area $\frac\pi4$; such a rhombus can't be dissected into rational triangles, and it's hard to imagine any shared dissection it would have with, e.g., the rhombus with all sides of length $2$ and area $\frac\pi4$.  (Which admittedly isn't a proof that one doesn't exist!) A fair bit of rummaging around the web has turned up nothing on the topic; if anyone has pointers to similar matters, they'd be very much appreciated.","['geometry', 'polygons', 'dissection']"

1197197,Relationship between very ample divisors and hyperplane sections,"This question is based on a line in the proof of corollary IV.3.3 in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry. The first line of the proof goes: ""if $D$ is an ample divisor (on a curve $X$), then some multiple is very ample, so $nD\sim H$, where $H$ is a hyperplane section for a projective embedding."" This line suggests that there is some obvious relationship between hyperplane sections and very ample divisors, namely that any very ample divisor is linearly equivalent to a hyperplane section. Why is this true? Is this done somewhere else in Hartshorne? (I've been looking for a long time, but I can't seem to find it anywhere else!)",['algebraic-geometry']

Find the values of $\lambda$ for which a nontrivial solution exists and find the corresponding eigenvector. While I think that the above routine problem is a good practice, the students have done this a lot in HW.

1197246,Subspace of metrizable and separable space is separable [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Subspace of a separable space is separable (2 answers) Closed 7 years ago . I need to show (using the fact that for metrizable space: space is separable $\iff$ it has got a countable base) that if $X$ is metrizable and separable, then every subspace $Y \subset X $ is separable. My idea: If $X$ is separable (and is metrizable), then $X$ has got a countable base. Let's call it $\mathcal{B}$. Let $U=\bigcup_{i \in I} Bi$ such that $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$. So $U$ is open in $X$. Then $U\cap Y$ is open in $Y$. So $U \cap Y=\bigcup_{i \in I} Bi \cap Y$ such that $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$. So I want to say that $\mathcal{C}=\{B \cap Y: B\in\mathcal{B}\}$ is the base of $Y$. And becasue $\mathcal{B}$ is countable, then $\mathcal{C}$ is also countable. Then $Y$ is also separable. Is it a correct proof (if not how can I improve it)? How should I show that $\mathcal{C}$ is really a base?","['metric-spaces', 'general-topology']"

against the alternatively hypothesis
$$H_1: \ the \ fuel\ consumption \ of \ his \ car \ does \ depends \ on \ the \ gasoline$$
The alternatively is 2-sided hypothesis. I did start with arrange all the observations in order of magnitude and did get

$$R_2= sum \ of \ ranks \ of \ sample 2 = 172.5$$ there we have 7 groups of doublets and 1 group of triplets.

Sandwich rule Saying that $\log \left(|x| + e^{|y|}\right) < |x| + e^{|y|}$:
$$\begin{align}
\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} \frac{\log \left(|x| + e^{|y|}\right)}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} &< \\
 & \lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} \frac{|x| + e^{|y|}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \\
 &= \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{|r\cos \theta| + e^{|r\sin\theta|}}{r} \\
 &= \lim_{r \to 0} |\cos\theta| + \frac{e^{|r\sin\theta|}}{r}
\end{align}$$
From here it seems that the limit doesn't exist, so it doesn't indicate anything on the given function. 2. Polar coordinates Tried expressing $x=r\cos\theta, y=r\sin\theta$, though got stuck right at the $\log$ function. Also tried using it in the Sandwich rule above, to no avail. 3. Single variable assignment Another technique is to replace an expression of $x$ and $y$ with a single variable $t$, but for this case it is not helpful. The $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ strongly indicates on Polar, though I can't work through that $\log$ and $e$.

Then: $$y'(x)= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n a_n x^{n-1}= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+1) a_{n+1} x^n$$ $$y''(x)= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (n+1) n a_{n+1} x^{n-1}= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+2) (n+1) a_{n+2} x^n$$ Thus: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+2) (n+1) a_{n+2} x^n+ x \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n=0 \\ \Rightarrow \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+2)(n+1) a_{n+2} x^n+ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^{n+1}=0 \\ \Rightarrow \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+2)(n+1) a_{n+2} x^n+ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n-1} x^n=0 \\ \Rightarrow 2a_2+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left[ (n+2) (n+1) a_{n+2}+ a_{n-1}\right] x^n=0$$ So it has to hold: $$a_2=0 \\ (n+2) (n+1) a_{n+2}+a_{n-1}=0, \forall n=1,2,3, \dots$$ For $n=1$: $3 \cdot 2 \cdot a_3+ a_0=0 \Rightarrow a_3=-\frac{a_0}{6}$ For $n=2$: $4 \cdot 3 \cdot a_4+a_1=0 \Rightarrow a_4=-\frac{a_1}{12}$ For $n=3$: $5 \cdot 4 \cdot a_5+a_2=0 \Rightarrow a_5=0$ For $n=4$: $6 \cdot 5 \cdot a_6+a_3=0 \Rightarrow 30 a_6-\frac{a_0}{6}=0 \Rightarrow a_6=\frac{a_0}{6 \cdot 30}=\frac{a_0}{180}$ For $n=5$: $7 \cdot 6 \cdot a_7+ a_4=0 \Rightarrow 7 \cdot 6 \cdot a_7-\frac{a_1}{12}=0 \Rightarrow a_7=\frac{a_1}{12 \cdot 42}$ Is it right so far?
