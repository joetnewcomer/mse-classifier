3161113,Tricky Integral -- $\int_0^1 \sqrt{x^2-4x+3} \arcsin(x)~dx$,"TL;DR: I can't get a closed form for the integral below. $$ \int_0^1 \sqrt{x^2-4x+3} \arcsin(x)~dx $$ I got an interesting question from a coworker a while ago: Question: The quantities $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are chosen uniformly and independently from $[0, 1]$ . a) What is the probability a triangle can be constructed with $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ as side lengths? b) Given we can form such a triangle, what is its expected area? I can do a) pretty easily -- each constraint like $a < b + c$ cuts off a corner of the cube with area $1/6$ , and the cut-off bits are disjoint, so the remaining area is $1/2$ . Part b) is where things get hairy. I can reduce the problem down to a single integral. I feel like it should be expressible in terms of known constants, though I admit I have no good reason to believe this. $$
\frac{3}{40} \int_0^1 x \sqrt{3-4x+x^2} \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} + \frac{\arcsin{x}}{x} \right)~dx
$$ That can be split into two parts: $$
\frac{3}{40} \int_0^1 x \sqrt{(3-4x+x^2)(1 - x^2)}~dx + \frac{3}{40} \int_0^1 \sqrt{3-4x+x^2} \arcsin(x)~dx
$$ The first part can be solved exactly. $$
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 x \sqrt{(3-4x+x^2)(1 - x^2)}~dx &= \int_0^1 x \sqrt{(3-x)(1-x)(1-x)(1+x)}~dx \\

3161185,Interesting applications of density to prove difficult theorems,"If we wanted to prove certain statements for every element of a set $S$ , a possible approach is to prove the statement for a certain dense subset $S'\subset S$ (with respect to a certain metric), then show that if the statement is true for $S'$ then it is for $S$ . Sometimes, this approach can reduce the proof of a difficult theorem to something nearly trivial, such as the following proof of Cayley-Hamilton: Theorem. Let $A\in M_n(\mathbb C)$ , and let $p(\lambda)$ be the characteristic polynomial of $A$ . Then $p(A)=0$ . Proof. The statement is trivial for diagonal matrices. If $A$ is diagonalisable, write $A=P\Lambda P^{-1}$ for the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues $\Lambda$ . Since the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is the same as that of $\Lambda$ , we have $p(A)=Pp(\Lambda)P^{-1}$ , and since $p(\Lambda)=0$ , we have $p(A)=0$ . By the density of diagonalisable matrices in $M_n(\mathbb C)$ , we recover the general statement for all matrices in $M_n(\mathbb C)$ .

3161200,Understanding the elementary factors in Weierstrass factorization theorem,"An infinite product such as $\,\prod _{n}(z-c_{n})$ cannot converge. In order for it to converge, each factor $(z-c_{n})$ must approach 1 as $n\to \infty$ . So it stands to reason that one should seek a function that could be 0 at a prescribed point, yet remain near 1 when not at that point and furthermore introduce no more zeroes than those prescribed. This is where Weierstrass' elementary factors come in as they have these properties and serve the same purpose as the factors $(z-c_{n})$ above. So far I can follow, but then the elementary factors are presented as... $E_{n}(z)={\begin{cases}(1-z)&{\text{if }}n=0,\\(1-z)\exp \left({\frac  {z^{1}}{1}}+{\frac  {z^{2}}{2}}+\cdots +{\frac  {z^{n}}{n}}\right)&{\text{otherwise}}.\end{cases}}$ and it is stated that the utility of the elementary factors $E_{n}(z)$ lies in the following lemma... Lemma (15.8, Rudin) for $| z | ≤ 1$ , $n\in \mathbb {N}$ $\vert 1-E_{n}(z)\vert \leq \vert z\vert ^{{n+1}}$ I simply do not understand why the Lemma is important, or even what it is trying to prove, nor do I understand the value of using the $exp$ . There's no explanation surrounding it, so seeing it for the first time makes little sense to me. Can someone please re-explain the Lemma in terms that might help me understand it, and perhaps prove to me why it is necessary to prove that $E_{n}(z)$ converges?","['complex-analysis', 'convergence-divergence', 'infinite-product', 'weierstrass-factorization']"

Suppose that $g(x)\neq 0$ , for all $x\in B_r$ . $g(B_r)$ is relatively compact. Define $f:B_r\to B_r$ by $f(x)=-r\frac{g(x)}{\|g(x)\|}$ . I want to show that $f(B_r)$ is relatively compact. I'm trying to apply the ""sequential criterion"". For this, we need to show that every sequence in $f(B_r)$ has a subsequence which converges in $X$ . Let $y_n=-r\frac{g(x_n)}{\|g(x_n)\|}$ be a sequence in $f(B_r)$ . Since $g(B_r)$ is relatively compact, $z_n=g(x_n)$ has a convergent subsequence $z_{n'}=g(x_{n'})$ . Let us write $$\lim_{n'\to\infty} z_{n'}=\lim_{n'\to\infty} g(x_{n'})=z.$$ If $z\neq 0$ , then $y_n$ has the convergent subsequence $y_{n'}=-r\frac{g(x_{n'})}{\|g(x_{n'})\|}$ , which converges to $-r\frac{z}{\|z\|}$ . Question: How to deal with the case $z=0$ ? Different arguments (without sequences) would also be appreciated.

3161381,"Why does the integral domain ""being trapped between a finite field extension"" implies that it is a field?","The following is an exercise from Qing Liu's Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves . Exercise 1.2. Let $\varphi : A \to B$ be a homomorphism of finitely generated algebras over a field. Show that the image of a closed point under $\operatorname{Spec} \varphi$ is a closed point. The following is the solution from Cihan Bahran. http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~bahra004/alg-geo/liu-soln.pdf . Write $k$ for the underlying field. Let’s parse the statement. A closed point in $\operatorname{Spec} B$ means a maximal ideal $n$ of $B$ . And $\operatorname{Spec}(\varphi)(n) = \varphi^{−1}(n)$ . So we want to show that $p := \varphi{−1}(n)$ is a maximal ideal in $A$ . First of all, $p$ is definitely a prime ideal of $A$ and $\varphi$ descends to an injective $k$ -algebra homomorphism $ψ : A/p \to B/n$ . But the map $k \to B/n$ defines a finite field extension of $k$ by Corollary 1.12. So the integral domain $A/p$ is trapped between a finite field extension. Such domains are necessarily fields, thus $p$ is maximal in $A$ . In the second last sentence, the writer says that the integral domain $A/p$ is trapped between a finite field extension. I don't exactly know what it means, but I think it means that there are two injective ring homomorphisms $f:k\to A/p$ and $g:A/p\to B/n$ such that $g\circ f$ makes $B/n$ a finite field extension of $k$ .

3161390,Frattini subgroup is normal-monotone,"In the exercise 6.1.22 of Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra (Here $\Phi(G)$ is the Frattini subgroup of $G$ ): If $N\unlhd G$ , then $\Phi(N)\subseteq\Phi(G)$ . When every proper subgroup of $N$ is contained in a maximal subgroup of $N$ , the statement can be proved. (By taking $M$ as a maximal subgroup of $G$ that fails to contain $\Phi(N)$ and deriving $N=\Phi(N)(N\cap M)$ , a contradiction.) But, as there may not exist a maximal subgroup of $N$ containing $N\cap M$ , the case is different when some proper subgroup of $N$ is not contained in a maximal subgroup of $N$ . Hence I'd like to ask that if $N\unlhd G$ and $M$ a maximal subgroup of $G$ , could the case that there does not exist a maximal subgroup of $N$ containing $N\cap M$ happen? Or is there another way to prove the statement? (Otherwise, is there a counterexample that the statement does not hold when some proper subgroup of $N$ is not contained in a maximal subgroup of $N$ ?) In fact , I wonder that if a group satisfies the condition that every proper subgroup is contained in a maximal subgroup, could it be possible that the condition does not apply to its normal subgroup?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
3161398,If X has a countable basis then uncountably many points of A are limit points of A,"Please note that the title is not the complete question I am asking, it just serves as a topic summary. The question is below. I am hoping someone can review my proof. I have put a (*) next to the claim I am personally most uncertain about. Thanks in advance! Question: Let X have a countable basis; let A be an uncountable subset of X. Show that uncountably many points of A are limit points of A. Proof: Let X be a topological space with a countable basis. 
Let A be an uncountable subset of X. Let A' be the set of limit points of A that are contained within A. Suppose A' is not uncountable. Then A' is countable. Since A is uncountable, we have B = A - A' is non-empty. (*) Also we have that B must be uncountable since if B was countable we would have: $$ A = B \bigcup A' $$ But then A would be the union of two countable sets, which is countable. Yet A was chosen to be uncountable. So B must be uncountable. So we have B $\subset$ A and B consists of an uncountable number of points each of which is a member of A yet not a limit point of A. Then we for each x $_i$ $\in$ B we can find an open set U $_i$ such that x $\in$ U $_i$ and U $_i$ $\bigcap$ A = {x $_i$ }. Then since U $_i$ is open it must contain some basis element B $_i$ such that x $_i$ $\in$ B $_i$ $\subseteq$ U $_i$ . Now the set of B $_i$ basis elements is an uncountable set of basis elements of X since for each unique $x_i$ we produce a unique B $_i$ .  Consider that for some x $_n$ and x $_z$ that their corresponding open basis elements B $_n$ and B $_z$ cannot be the same basis elements since if either were, the basis element would contain both x $_n$ and x $_z$ which is not allowed since the points of B are limit points and the open set B $_i$ must only intersect A in one single point, that is x $_i$ . Hence we have an uncountable collection of basis elements in a space that has a countable basis. A contradiction. So A must contain uncountably many points that are limit points of A.","['general-topology', 'proof-verification']"

0 & I_n \\
-I_n & 0\\

Is it true that $$\lim_{t\to \infty}\frac{1}{t} \log \Vert{e^{At}}\Vert=\max_i(\text{Re}(\lambda_i))$$ where $\lambda_i$ are are all the eigenvalues of $A$ and $\Vert \cdot \Vert$ is the spectral norm? I'm interested in computing the Lyapunov exponent of critical points of Hamiltonian systems. This type of limit appears in such cases. From numerical calculations this seems to be true. I've been able to prove this result for the $2\times2$ case, where $A=\begin{pmatrix}
a & b\\
c & -a\\
\end{pmatrix}.$ In this case, setting $\lambda=\sqrt{a^2 + b c}$ , $M=\frac{1}{\lambda}A$ is an involutory matrix. Then the exponential $\Vert{e^{\lambda M t}}\Vert$ may be written in terms of hyperbolic trigonometric functions, which are bounded in the $\lambda$ imaginary case, and may be approximated in terms of exponentials in the $\lambda$ real case. The above result follows easily then, and it is actually independent of the norm. I'm having problems in the general case. I wanted to find a way to write $A$ as a block diagonal matrix consisting of smaller Hamiltonian matrices via a unitary transformation, and then prove it inductively over $n$ , but I've had no luck finding such result.

3161645,How many ways are there to choose 5 groups of 30 workers?,"I have 90 workers and I have to do 6 groups so that the total number of workers in the groups is 30. In each group there must be at least one worker. Each group will be assigned a different task. The first thing I have done is to count the ways of choosing 30 workers from a group of 90: $C_{90,30}=\frac{90!}{30!60!}=\frac{90!}{30!60!}$ Now I'm going to calculate the possible ways to make 5 groups with the 30 workers. To each worker I assigned the number 0 and I used the number 1 to delimit each group. So the groups that I have are: $PR_{35}^{30,5}=\frac{35!}{5!30!}$ So the total number of elections are: $\frac{90!}{30!60!}·\frac{35!}{5!30!}$ The problem with this way of calculating it includes the possibility that there are two consecutive ones. This implies that you would have a group with 0 people and by hypothesis it can not be.
How do I not include the permutations that have two consecutive ones? EDIT:
 I have thought about calculating the number of permutations that has 2 consecutive ones, 3 followed ones, 4 followed ones and the 5 followed ones and applying the Inclusion-exclusion principle. To calculate the permutations with two ones followed I treat them as if they were a single element and I get: $PR_{34}^{30,3,1}$ . 
In the same way I calculate the other cases and in the end I obtain that the possible ways of doing 5 groups with 30 people and no empty group are: $PR_{35}^{30,5}-PR_{34}^{30,3,1}+PR_{33}^{30,2,1}-PR_{32}^{30,1,1}+PR_{31}^{30,1}$ Therefore, the solution to the problem is: $C_{90,30}·(PR_{35}^{30,5}-PR_{34}^{30,3,1}+PR_{33}^{30,2,1}-PR_{32}^{30,1,1}+PR_{31}^{30,1})$ Its rigth?","['combinations', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

3161670,Motivation and references for an integral formula in measure theory,"In Measure Theory class, my professor presented an integral formula to us that seems overly useful. Weirdly, though, I could not find any sources with the formula. So I have several requests/questions: What is the motivation of the formula? Where does it come up naturally and how would you discover it? More examples or better: references for this formula would be much appreciated. Theorem. Let $(X, \mathfrak{A}, \mu)$ and $([0,\infty], \mathfrak{B}([0,\infty]), \nu)$ be $\sigma$ -finite measure spaces with $$ \varphi(t) = \nu([0,t)) \quad \text{for } t \geq 0. $$ Then, for measurable $f:X \to [0,\infty]$ we have $$ \int_X \varphi \circ f \ d \mu = \int_{[0,\infty)} \mu(f>t) \ d\nu(t). $$ Proof. Follows quickly with Tonelli's theorem. I mentioned that it seems overly useful. Here are examples that our professor presented (in short): Letting $d\nu(t) = pt^{p-1} d\lambda(t)$ we get $$ \int_X f^p \ d \mu = p \int_0^\infty t^{p-1} \mu(f>t) \ dt$$ which in particular gives an alternate definition for $\int_X f \ d \mu$ for $p = 1$ . Letting $X = [0,\infty), f = \operatorname{id}, d\mu(x) = e^{-x} \ d\lambda(x)$ we get with the above examples $$ \Gamma(p+1) = p \Gamma(p).$$ While it does seem like an overkill here, the formula above could somehow be connected to integration by parts (as the most elementary proof of the functional equation of $\Gamma$ would be by integration by parts)? Letting $\psi : \mathbb{R}^n \to [0,\infty), \ x \mapsto \|x\|_2^2$ and $\nu = \psi \circ \lambda^n$ as well as $d\mu(t) = e^{-t} \ d\lambda(t), f = \operatorname{id}$ we get with some work the volume $\omega_n$ of a $n$ -dimensional sphere $$ \omega_n = \frac{\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma \left(\frac{n}{2} + 1 \right)}.$$ The main work of the formula was to prove $$ \omega_n \Gamma \left(\frac{n}{2} + 1 \right) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-\|x\|_2^2} d\lambda(x).$$ An example of mine: I believe that the right substitutions yield the interpretation that the Lebesgue integral describes the area/measure under a graph. So the formula would at least be a generalization of that. These example should convince anyone of the usefulness of the formula.","['integration', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-integral']"

If such group exists, it has to be infinite, as every finite group is characteristically simple iff it is verbally simple (the proof of this fact can be found here: Does there exist some sort of classification of finite verbally simple groups? ). However that proof, relies strongly on mathematical induction by the group order and is thus valid only for finite groups (and not all Artinian groups are finite).

Analogously, we can define isogonal conjugation for quadrilateral (and even for $n$ -gon). It's well-known that point $P$ has an isogonal conjugate with respect to quadrilateral $ABCD$ if and only if projections $P$ onto sides $ABCD$ lie on the circle (and similar criteria for $n$ -gon).

(""Largest"" here is in the sense of big-O asymptotics.) In particular, I'd like to know whether the smallest functions for which this integral diverges are the constant functions. Obviously, any function for which the integral converges must satisfy $f(x) = o(1)$ ; that is to say, $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = 0$ . Any $f$ that satisfies $f = O(x^{-\epsilon})$ for some $\epsilon > 0$ , conversely, obviously works. One can further construct large families of functions $f$ asymptotically between $1$ and any $x^{-\epsilon}$ ; that is, such that $f = o(1)$ but $x^{-\epsilon} = o(f)$ for every $\epsilon > 0$ .

Gromov's compactness theorem states that the space of $J$ -holomorphic curves $u:S^2\to M$ with energy bounded above by $C$ is compact, modulo bubbling. The usual way of employing Gromov's theorem is by using a compatible symplectic form on $(M,J)$ and restricting to the space of $J$ -holomorphic maps to a fixed homology class $A\in H_2(M;\mathbb{Z})$ : all curves in this class have equal energy.

After some quick attempts to simplify, I decided to try some integral calculators with set values. Needless to say, the result after the first integral seemed so hopeless that I couldn't imagine simplifying and integrating again--not to mention then generalising constant inputs to their original variable form. However, there is a strong likelihood that $I$ simplifies to one of the following two solutions: $$\text{1.This solution comes from inverse square laws}$$ $$I=\frac{1}{d^2}$$ $$\text{2.

I've given two possible solutions and it's probable that the answer will be one of those.

So the permutations of $\{1,2,3\}$ are $123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321$ . A decreasing binary plane tree on $X$ is a rooted tree labeled with the elements of $X$ in which each vertex has at most two children, each child is either a right or a left child, the labels are distinct, and every nonroot vertex has a label that is strictly smaller than its parent's label. There is a well-known bijection $T$ between permutations of $X$ and decreasing binary plane trees on $X$ . If $\pi$ is a permutation, we can write $\pi=LnR$ , where $n$ is the largest entry in the permutation. Then let $T(\pi)$ be the decreasing binary plane tree whose root is labeled with $n$ and whose left and right subtrees are $T(L)$ and $T(R)$ , respectively. We can consider the shape of a decreasing binary plane tree $T$ , which is simply the unlabeled binary plane tree obtained by deleting the labels of $T$ . Let us say a permutation statistic $f$ is good if $f(\pi)$ only depends on the shape of $T(\pi)$ . For example, the number of descents of $\pi$ is the number of right edges in $T(\pi)$ , so the number of descents is a good statistic. The number of peaks of $\pi$ is the number of vertices in $T(\pi)$ that have two children, so the number of peaks is also good.

I can use kernel density estimation, and then estimate the KL divergence with a Monte Carlo estimator (e.g., here or here ), or fit a probability distribution to $X$ and $Y$ (e.g. Gaussian or GMM), and then come up with a distance (e.g. based on parameters or analytic KL divergences say), but simple distributions don't fit well, this has too many parameters I need to tweak, and it seems unnecessarily complex. (The Monte Carlo KL estimates didn't perform well either; I'd like to avoid density estimation). There's also the Hausdorff distance which has some probabilistic connections but depends wildly on $n$ . I haven't yet explored kernelized maximum mean discrepancy much, which seems promising though. However, I have seen quite a few papers lately use the Chamfer Distance (it is not a metric , but it is some form of divergence nonetheless) as an efficient (yet still quite effective in practice) substitute for the EMD. (e.g. see [1] , [2] ).
It is written $$ \mathcal{D}_C[X,Y] = \frac{1}{|X|} \sum_{x\in X} \min_{y\in Y} d(x,y) + \frac{1}{|Y|} \sum_{y\in Y} \min_{x\in X} d(x,y) $$ where $d:D\times D\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^+$ is some distance metric, e.g. $d(x,y)=||x-y||_2^2$ . Basically, for each point in one set, we get the closest point in the other set, and compute the distance between them - summing the result over the set, and then doing the same for the other set. Sometimes the normalizing fractions are left out. My questions : Is there a probabilistic connection to using this on samples? E.g., for a particular $d$ , is there a well-known continuous divergence that this approximates/bounds? Can $\mathcal{D}_C$ be used as a reasonable (pseudo)-distance between $P$ and $Q$ ? For example, can we guarantee that, as $n\rightarrow\infty$ , if $D_C[X,Y]\rightarrow 0$ , then, say, the KL or JS-divergence must also shrink to zero or be bounded by it? What sort of assumptions would be needed for this?","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'sampling', 'convergence-divergence', 'probability']"
3162667,Prove that if there are integers $m$ and $n$ such that $am +bn =1$ then $a$ and $b$ are coprime.,"Suppose $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ . Prove  that if there are integers $m$ and $n$ such that $am +bn =1$ then $a$ and $b$ are coprime. I came up with the following proof, but I am sure a shorter argument is possible. To prove : $\forall a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ , $\exists  m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ | $am + bn = 1\rightarrow $ $gcd(a,b) = 1$ In order to prove this by contradiciton, suppose then that $\exists m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ | $am + bn = 1$ and that $gcd(a,b) \neq 1$ . Take $ k = gcd(a,b) \neq 1$ . Now, $k = ra+sb$ and $s,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ , assuming that k can be written as a linear combination of a and b. This is an established theorem. So we have: (1) $am + bn = 1$ (2) $ra + sb = k$ Adding $(1) + (2)$ , we get : $(r+m)a + (s+n)b = k+1$ Since $ k= gcd(a,b)$ , then $k|(r+m)a$ and $k|(s+n)b$ . Then $k|(r+m)a + (s+n)b = k+1$ . So $k|k+1$ . But this is impossible, since dividing $k \neq1$ into $k$ gives a remainder of 1. Having derived this contradiction, it cannot be the case that if $am + bn = 1$ , then $gcd(a,b) \neq 1$ . So it must be the case that: ( $\exists  m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ | $am + bn = 1$ ) $\rightarrow $ ( $gcd(a,b) = 1$ )","['gcd-and-lcm', 'divisibility', 'discrete-mathematics', 'prime-numbers']"
3162678,Are my calculations of the pregnancy ratio of the population correct?,"So this question is a math question having to do with me calculating the rate of population growth starting from a population of 100,000. I have already gotten the first 3 steps done(sex ratio, ratio of cycle time, and pregnancy ratio after a week among those in the fertile timeframe(calculating the ratio amongst the entire female population which is what I'm after should be relatively easy afterwards). Monthly Cycle numbers Here is the cycle ratio: $2_{early}:2_{fertile}:1_{late}$ And the numbers: $20,000_{early}:20,000_{fertile}:10,000_{late}$ Now, let's divide the early into 2 groups, pre-fertile, and safe and assume there is a 50/50 split between those 2 groups. Let's also assume that all the people in the fertile group are in the late group after a week, all those that are in the late group, are in the safe group after a week and so on. This suggests a cycle length of $4$ but let me verify it. After a week: $10,000_{safe}:10,000_{pre-fertile}:10,000_{fertile}:20,000_{late}$ After 2 weeks: $20,000_{safe}:10,000_{pre-fertile}:10,000_{fertile}: 10,000_{late}$ After 3 weeks: $10,000_{safe}:20,000_{pre-fertile}:10,000_{fertile}:10,000_{late}$ Yep, cycle length of $4$ is confirmed. To get the pregnancy ratio after a month of trying for pregnancy, I need the exact division which is a tad more complicated. Figuring out pregnancy ratio The ratio amongst the people in the fertile window of people who become pregnant is $2:3$ or $40\%$ Anti-miscarriage meds only work at or after 4 weeks has passed. Their effectiveness is $60\%$ at 4 weeks and $70\%$ at 5 weeks. It is 100% effective at 6 weeks. Here are the miscarriage rates: 3 weeks: 30.9% 4 weeks: 35.4% 5 weeks: 26.9% So for the first week, $8,000$ become pregnant and the other $12,000$ in the fertile window go on to be in the late group. Ratio is $8,000_{pregnant}:42,000_{non-pregnant}$ which simplifies to $4:21$ or in terms of percents, $16\%$ of the female population. After a week, another $4,000$ become pregnant. However, 30.9% of those from the starting week have a miscarriage. That is $2472$ people who miscarried, fewer than the number that became pregnant. Now the number is at $9,528$ pregnancies. After another week, another $4,000$ become pregnant. 30.9% of those from the previous week miscarry. On top of that, 40% of the predicted 35.4% miscarry. So that is $1,236 + 783 = 2019$ miscarriages. This is fewer than those that become pregnant so there is an overall increase again. Now $11,509$ people are pregnant After a third week, another $4,000$ become pregnant. 30.9% of those from the previous week, 40% of 35.4% of those that became pregnant the week before last, and 30% of 26.9% of those that became pregnant on the starting week miscarry. This adds up to $1,236 + 566 + 346 = 2,148$ miscarriages. Now $13,361$ people are pregnant. After a fourth week, another $8,800$ become pregnant. At this point, there is no more push to become pregnant so the miscarriage calculations will get simpler from here. Here are the numbers for the miscarriages: $177 + 391 + 1236 = 1804$ miscarriages. Now, this is way less than the number that became pregnant so the total number of pregnancies now is $20,357$ Fifth week: $2,719 + 391 + 192 = 3,302$ miscarriages $17,055$ pregnancies Sixth week: $192 + 861 = 1,053$ miscarriages $16,002$ pregnancies Seventh week: $421$ miscarriages The final number of pregnancies is $15,581$ pregnancies Percentage pregnant is $31.2\%$ which is approximately a $3:10$ ratio Did I do my calculations correctly or did I make a mistake somewhere in the sea of multiplication, addition, and subtraction to calculate the miscarriage and pregnancy numbers week by week? NOTE: My calculations assume no fertility after the miscarriage for several months, no other causes of fetal death besides spontaneous abortion(otherwise known as a miscarriage), and no maternal death while pregnant so despite matching the percent of the population that become pregnant after 1 try very closely, it might not be a realistic percentage for after 2-4 tries. Also, it is only this step, calculating the number of pregnancies that I need you to verify. Caculating how many are twins, etc. I should be able to do fine on my own.","['statistics', 'ratio']"

3163038,"The use of limit in Titchmarsh's book ""The theory of the Riemann zeta-function"" in Theorem $3.13$","In Titchmarsh's book ""The theory of the Riemann Zeta-function"" his Lemma $3.12$ is one of the main tools. Lemma $3.12$ is a version of Perron formula. Lemma $3.12$ starts by observing that, with $c>0$ and with $n<x$ , $$
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int\limits_{c-iT}^{c+iT}\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)^w \frac{\mathrm dw}{w}=1+
O\left( \frac{(x/n)^c}{T\log (x/n)} \right)
$$ This stems from the fact that $c>0$ , and so if one completes the integration contour to the left by encircling the point $w=0$ completely in the complex $w$ plane by a rectangle whose right-most side is the original integration line $(c-iT,c+iT)$ , the residue is simply $1$ . This is the reason for the requirement $c>0$ . The requirement $n<x$ comes from letting the left-most side of the integration rectangle be at $\Re(w)=-\infty$ and so $(x/n)^w\to 0$ if and only if $n<x$ as $\Re(w)\to -\infty$ . And so, in Theorem $3.13$ the starting point is the application of Lemma $3.12$ , $$
\sum\limits_{n<x} \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int\limits_{c-iT}^{c+iT}
\frac{x^w \mathrm dw}{w\zeta(s+w)}+
O\left( \frac{x^c}{cT} \right)+
O\left( \frac{\log x}{T} \right)
$$ On the LHS the condition $n<x$ is the condition from Lemma $3.12$ , and $c$ is still required to obey $c>0$ . Now Titchmarsh enlarges the contour of integration and encloses the $w=0$ completely, as earlier. Do notice that $c>0$ should still hold, since $c$ is nothing else but $\Re(w)$ on the right-most side the integration contour. No matter how the original line $(c-iT,c+iT)$ is deformed, the deformed closed integration contour must enclose the point $w=0$ , and hence $c>0$ on the RHS part of the contour that intersects the real axis in $w$ plane. With $c>0$ the pole at $w=0$ produces the residue $1/\zeta(s)$ and the result is now $$\sum\limits_{n<x} \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}=\frac{1}{\zeta(s)}+O$$ The $O$ term tends to $0$ in the end, after Titchmarsh adjusts $T$ and $x$ appropriately. And so then Titchmarsh requires $$c=\frac{1}{\log x}$$ Additionally, he then lets $x\to\infty$ . But in this limit, $c\to 0$ . And this makes the original starting equation useless, since the pole of the integrand at $w=0$ is no longer enclosed in the integration countour, but lies on the integration contour instead, if one interprets the limit as $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}x=\infty$ . On the other hand, if one interprets the limit $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}x$ in the way that $x$ grows large but never hits the point at infinity, then $c$ never reaches $0$ , and this would do. But aren't there problems with this interpretation of a limit in standard mathematics? Maybe Titchmarsh uses the Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem , but then the result misses the summand $\frac{1}{2\zeta(s)}$ ... Or maybe I'm missing some detail completely here... So my question is: What exactly enables Titchmarsh to take the limit $x\to\infty$ ?","['complex-analysis', 'riemann-zeta']"

Show by example that the previous statement may be false for a general metric space $T$ . Def:(Packing numbers). A subset $\cal{N}$ of a metric space $(T,d)$ is $\epsilon$ -separated if $d(x,y)>\epsilon$ for all distinct points $x,y\in \cal{N}$ . The largest possible cardinality of an $\epsilon$ -separated subset of a given set $K\subset T$ is called the packing number of $K$ and is denoted by $P(K,d,\epsilon)$ Proof: Suppose $P(K,d,\epsilon)= n$ , so there are $n$ points in $K$ which are $\epsilon$ -separated. Each of these $n$ points can be thought as a center of a $\epsilon/2$ radius ball. Then there are $n$ closed disjoint balls of radius $\epsilon/2$ , that have their center in K.

3163412,AM-GM inequality for functions,"As all you masters in math know, the famous AM-GM inequality in positive numbers is as follows: $${1\over n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_k\ge \left(\prod_{k=1}^{n}x_k\right)^{1\over n}$$ which can be rewritten in the following  alternative form: $$\large{1\over n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_k\ge e^{{1\over n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\ln x_k}$$ An interpretation says that the (ordinary or arithmetic) average of a bunch of data, $x_k$ , is not smaller than the exponential of the average of $\ln x_k$ s . Now, if we interpret $x_k$ s as infinitesimal parts of some function ,say $f(x)$ , and correspondingly consider $\ln x_k$ as infinitesimal parts of $\ln f(x)$ , intuition says: $$\large{1\over T}\int_0^T f(x)dx\ge e^{{1\over T}\int_0^T \ln f(x)dx}$$ in an arbitrary interval $(0,T)$ . so naturally, my question is: is this relation even true for any positive $f(x)$ ?

3163446,Coordinate-Free Computation of Covariant Derivative,"Suppose $S$ is an oriented 2-dimensional manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle$ . Let $\theta$ be a 1-form on $S$ . By non-degeneracy, there is an identification of the tangent and cotangent bundle via the metric. In particular, there is a bundle map $Y \colon TS \rightarrow TS$ such that $$\langle Y_x(v),w \rangle = d\theta_x(v,w). $$ Likewise, there exists a vector field $Z$ on $S$ with $$\langle Z(x),v \rangle = \theta_x(v).$$ I am interested in computing the covariant derivative of $Z$ .
Of course, this is possible in local coordinates, but the computation becomes super messy since the Riemannian metric comes into play several times. Hence, I would like to know if anybody can come up with a coordinate-free computation.
(edited:) Even if no explicit solution can be written down, I hope to verify the following formula: $$\langle v+Z,\nabla_wZ \rangle = \langle \nabla_{(v+Z)}Z,w \rangle - \langle Y(v+Z),w \rangle.$$ (For the interested: this is an intermediate step to verify that the symplectic gradient flow of the energy Hamiltonian for a magnetic form is conjuagted to the symplectic gradient flow of the Hamiltonian $E \circ \mathcal{L}^{-1}$ ( $E$ energy, $\mathcal{L}$ Legendre transform) for the standard symplectic form via the Legendre transform.) In my context, $Y$ maps a vector $v \in T_xS$ to $s(x)Jv$ , where $s$ is a smooth function on $S$ and $J$ is the canonical almost complex structure induced by the metric.

So I'm doing exercises regarding relations and compositions, and one of the exercises is: Suppose $R\subseteq A\times B$ , $S\subseteq B\times C$ and $T\subseteq C\times D$ . Which of the following statements are true? $(S\circ R)^{-1}=R^{-1}\circ S^{-1}$ $S\circ R=R^{-1}\circ S^{-1}$ $S\circ R=(R\circ S)^{-1}$ $(T\circ S)\circ R=T\circ (S\circ R)$ The answer to 1.: To prove 1., suppose $(c,a)\in(S\circ R)^{-1}$ . Then, by definition of the inverse relation, $(a,c)\in (S\circ R)$ . By the definition of the composite relation, there exists $b\in B$ such that $(a,b)\in R$ and $(b,c)\in S$ . This of course means $(c,b)\in S^{-1}$ and $(b,a)\in R^{-1}$ . Applying the definition of the composite relation again, we find $(c,a)\in R^{-1}\circ S^{-1}$ . Thus, $(S\circ R)\subseteq R^{-1}\circ S^{-1}$ . Similar arguments show $R^{-1}\circ S^{-1}\subseteq (S\circ R)$ and the result follows. Note that this is not my answer.

3163565,"Why does this trick to derive the formula for $[A^n,B]$ in terms of repeated commutators work so well?","It is a known result that, given generically noncommuting operators $A,B$ , we have $$ A^n B=\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \operatorname{ad}^k(A)(B) A^{n-k},\tag A $$ where $\operatorname{ad}^k(A)(B)\equiv[\underbrace{A,[A,[\dots,[A}_k,B]\dots]] $ . This can be proved for example via induction with not too much work. However, while trying to get a better understanding of this formula, I realised that there is a much easier way to derive it, at least on a formal, intuitive level. The trick Let $\hat{\mathcal S}$ and $\hat{\mathcal C}$ (standing for ""shift"" and ""commute"", respectively) denote operators that act on expressions of the form $A^k D^j A^\ell$ (denoting for simplicity $D^j\equiv\operatorname{ad}^j(A)(B)$ ) as follows: \begin{align}
\hat{\mathcal S} (A^k D^j A^\ell) 
&= A^{k-1} D^j A^{\ell+1}, \\
\hat{\mathcal C} (A^{k} D^{j} A^\ell)
&= A^{k-1} D^{j+1} A^{\ell}.
\end{align} In other words, $\hat{\mathcal S}$ ""moves"" the central $D$ block on the left, while $\hat{\mathcal C}$ makes it ""eat"" the neighboring $A$ factor. It is not hard to see that $\hat{\mathcal S}+\hat{\mathcal C}=\mathbb 1$ , which is but another way to state the identity $$A[A,B]=[A,B]A+[A,[A,B]].$$ Moreover, crucially, $\hat{\mathcal S}$ and $\hat{\mathcal C}$ commute.
Because of this, I can write $$A^n B=(\hat{\mathcal S}+\hat{\mathcal C})^n (A^n B)=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k} \hat{\mathcal S}^{n-k} \hat{\mathcal C}^{k}(A^n B),$$ which immediately gives me (A) without any need for recursion or other tricks. The question Now, this is all fine and dandy, but it leaves me wondering as to why does this kind of thing work ?
It looks like I am somehow bypassing the nuisance of having to deal with non-commuting operations by switching to a space of ""superoperators"", in which the same operation can be expressed in terms of commuting ""superoperators"". I am not even sure how one could go in formalising this ""superoperators"" $\hat{\mathcal S},\hat{\mathcal C}$ , as they seem to be objects acting on ""strings of operators"" more than on the elements of the operator algebra themselves. Is there a way to formalise this way of handling the expressions? Is this a well-known method in this context (I had never seen it but I am not well-versed in this kinds of manipulations)?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'noncommutative-algebra', 'operator-algebras']"

I first came across this topic when reading the book $\textit{Fermat's Last Theorem. A Genetic Introduction to Algebraic Number Theory}$ . After a brief search for details of Lamé's proof, I found in What was Lame's proof? the steps he followed, but, even in its fault, it does not work if $n=3$ , as the author himself claimed, in $x^n+y^n=z^n$ , the equation in Fermat's Last Theorem statement. I found that the result for $n=3$ was already proven to be true at the time, thanks only to the factorization of the left member of the equation, so Lamé did not actually needed to prove it. However, in many other sources, it is stated that there is a different proof which exploits the infinite descent method, like the one Lamé employed, but no one gives details about that. The closest I came was in some notes related to a course of algebraic number theory. They stated that, working in $\mathbb{Z}[j]$ , where $ j=\frac{-1+i\sqrt{3}}{3} $ is a 3rd-root of the unity in the complex field, $x^3 + y^3 = z^3$ can be rewritten as follows: $$ \left( \frac{x}{z} \right)^3 -1 = - \left( \frac{y}{z} \right)^3. \tag{1} \label{1} $$ So, by using $$X^3-1 = (X - 1)(X^2 + X + 1) = (X - 1)(X - j)(X - j^2),$$ and multiplyng by $z^3$ in $(\ref{1})$ , it ensues that: $$ (x - z)(x - jz)(x -j^2z) = -y^3. $$ Unfortunately, the notes ended by claiming that, from this identity, Lamé concluded by infinite descent using the additional fact that, if the product of three coprime integers is a cube, then each of the factor can be written as a cube. Here, the three coprime elements should be $ (x - z)$ , $(x - jz)$ and $(x -j^2z)$ . Probably, Lamé made a mistake in extending to $\mathbb{Z}[j]$ such a property known to be true only in the integer ring, still I can't understand how the infinite descent should develop, starting from this point.

Thank you very much.","['graph-theory', 'trees', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"
3164044,"Told by Professor that this is PIE, but don't see how it's PIE. Help understanding what constitutes the sets, or alternative ways to solve?","So, basically, my professor has taught us the principle of inclusion and exclusion. We were given the basic formulation of the problem using set theory (A $\cup$ B $\cup$ C), and then launched into examples. I failed to see in any of the examples how it related to set theory, and he seemed to want us to learn through pattern matching (which has left me very confused). An example of this: How many ways are there to assign five different jobs to four different employees if every employee is assigned at least one job? $4^5$ - $\binom{4}{1}$$3^5$ + $\binom{4}{2}$$2^5$ - $\binom{4}{3}$$1^5$ He talked us through this somewhat, but I couldn't understand how or why it worked. It seemed very much intuition based, as though it changed with every circumstance, rather than following a rule that was unchanging through the various circumstances. Calculating this, the answer is 240. I'm not good at pattern matching, and I don't really understand how the Professor chose the values that he did for the binomial coefficients, and I don't really understand what the sets constitute in this case (what does set A represent versus set B versus set C). My main question in this case is what do the sets represent, and what do the intersections being added and subtracted represent? I need more than a pattern in order to understand what's going on in this problem. My Dad was helping me with this problem and he didn't understand what the professor was doing either. He attempted to solve the problem this way: $\binom{5}{4}$$\cdot$ 4! $\cdot$$\binom{4}{1}$ The idea was to distribute one job to each of the four employees, determine the possible number of combinations, and then choose one employee for the remaining job. The answer was twice that of the Professor's answer. Either my Dad over-counted somehow, or it just plain isn't the correct way to solve the problem. Which is unfortunate because at least with that method I could see what was going on. My second question is whether or not there is any amendment that could be made to my Dad's method in order to get the correct answer with these problems, or if there is some second method of solving PIE problems that do not involve pure pattern matching? Thank you for taking the time to read this. I was trying to be as specific as possible, which was noted in the guidelines (vague questions get vague answers). I'm a first time poster, and so I would appreciate any additional feedback if there is something I can do to improve any future posts.","['inclusion-exclusion', 'combinatorics']"
3164063,Is a function $X \times Y \to Z$ continuous iff precomposition with continuous functions $X\to X\times Y$ and $Y\to X\times Y$ are continuous,"Is a function from a product space $X \times Y \to Z$ continuous if and only if  precomposition with all continuous functions $X\to X\times Y$ and $Y\to X\times Y$ are continuous? Clearly one direction holds for all spaces and I think I've shown that the other direction is true for functions $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ but I don't know if this is true generally or just true for nice enough spaces. Any counterexamples or special cases where this is true would be greatly appreciated. Update: I have shown this is true if your base spaces are path connected or locally path connected metric spaces using the Tietze extension theorem but I still don't know if this is true generally. Update: In retrospect, this argument only really works for spaces where there are short enough paths between close points, such as a length space. Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are path connected metric spaces. In metric spaces continuity is the same as sequential continuity. Take a convergent sequence $\{x_n\}$ and its limit $x_\infty$ in $X$ (or $Y$ ) and define a continuous map from $A=\{x_n\}\cup x_\infty$ to $\mathbb{R}$ which sends $x_n$ to $1/n$ and $x_\infty$ to 0. $A$ is a closed subset of $X$ so by the Tietze extension theorem it extends to a map $X\to \mathbb{R}$ . Then given a convergent sequence $\{z_n\}$ which converges to $z_\infty$ in $X\times Y$ we can construct a map from $\{ \frac{1}{n}\} \cup 0$ to our sequence which sends $\frac{1}{n}$ to $z_n$ and extend it to a map from $[0, 1]$ to $X\times Y$ by connecting the paths between $z_n$ and $z_{n+1}$ . We then extend that function to the entirety of $\mathbb{R}$ , which when composed with our function $X \to \mathbb{R}$ gives us a continuous function which takes a convergent sequence in $X$ to a convergent sequence in $X\times Y$ . If the image of the convergent sequence in $X$ under this map is convergent in $Z$ , then the image of the convergent sequence in $X\times Y$ will also be convergent in $Z$ .","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

3164182,How can a function with a hole (removable discontinuity) equal a function with no hole?,"I've done some research, and I'm hoping someone can check me. My question was this: Assume I have the function $f(x) = \frac{(x-3)(x+2)}{(x-3)}$ , so it has removable discontinuity at $x = 3$ . We remove that discontinuity with algebra: $f(x) = \frac{(x-3)(x+2)}{(x-3)} = (x+2)$ . BUT, the graph of the first function has a hole at $x = 3$ , and the graph of the second function is continuous everywhere. How can they be ""equal"" if one has a hole and the other does not? I think that this is the answer: Because the original function is undefined at the point $x = 3$ , we have to restrict the domain to $\mathbb{R} \setminus 3$ . And when we manipulate that function with algebra, the final result, $f(x) = (x + 2)$ is still using this restricted domain. So even though the function $f(x) = (x+2)$ would not have a hole if the domain were all of $\mathbb{R}$ , we are sort of ""imposing"" a hole at $x = 3$ by continuing to throw that point out of the domain. And then just to close the loop: Removing the removable discontinuity is useful because it allows us to ""pretend"" that we're working with a function that is everywhere continuous, which helps us easily find the limit. But the reality is that the function $f(x) = (x +2)$ is actually NOT continuous everywhere when we restrict the domain by throwing out the point 3. Or am I now taking things too far? Thanks in advance! EDIT: For anyone coming across this in the future, in addition to the excellent answers below, I also found this other question about the continuity of functions with removable discontinuities helpful.","['limits', 'calculus', 'continuity', 'faq']"

3164216,A series related to prime numbers,"Let $H(t) = \sum_{n=1} ^{\infty} \pi(n)t^n$ where $\pi(n)$ is the prime counting function. This is the Hilbert series of some $\mathbb{Q}$ -vector space. By the prime number theorem, the radius of convergence is $1$ . Observing $\pi(n) = \pi(n-1)+1$ if $n$ is prime and $\pi(n) = \pi(n-1)$ if $n$ is composite, we might rewrite this as $H(t) = f(t)/(1-t)$ where $f(t) =\sum_{p \text{ prime }} t^p$ . Define the sequence $b_n$ for $n=-1,0,1,2,\cdots$ as $ f'(t)/f(t) = \sum_{n=-1} b_n t^n$ . Then we can recover the primes from this sequence: $$ p = 2 + \sum_{q <p, q \text{ prime }} b_{p-1-q}$$ For example: For example the first coefficients are given by the series: $$2*t^{(-1)} + 1 + (-1)*t + 4*t^2 + (-5)*t^3 + 11*t^4 + (-16)*t^5 + 22*t^6 + (-37)*t^7 + 67*t^8 + (-101)*t^9 + 166*t^{10} + (-260)*t^{11} + 404*t^{12} + (-652)*t^{13} + \cdots $$ so $b_{-1} = 2, b_0 = 1, b_1 = -1 , b_2 = 4$ etc. We have for example: $$3 = 2+b_0 = 2+1$$ $$5 = 2+b_2+b_1 = 2+4-1$$ $$7 = 2+b_4+b_3+b_1 = 2+11-5-1$$ Let $a_{n,k}$ denote the number of ordered ways of writing $n$ as a sum of $k$ primes. 
Then after some calculation, one finds that: $$a_{n,k} = \frac{k}{n-2k} \sum_{v=0}^{n-1} {a_{v,k} b_{n-1-v}}$$ which is a recurence relation.
Furthermore if $\alpha_n$ $n=0,1,2,3,\cdots$ are all roots of $f(t)$ not equal to zero, then for $n\ge 0$ $$ b_n = - \sum_{k=0} ^ \infty \frac{1}{\alpha_k^{n+1}}$$ The numbers $b_n$ might be computed inductively using: $$ n a_{n,1} = \sum_{v=0}^n b_{v-1} a_{n-v,1}$$ from which one sees, that $b_n \in \mathbb{Z}$ . One real root of $f(t)$ seems to be the number, $$ \gamma = -0.62923 \cdots $$ (OEIS: http://oeis.org/A078756 ) Since everything related to primes has something to do with the Riemann Zeta function, I wonder, what is the relation to the stuff above to the Riemann Zeta function? If someone knows of any reference or has any idea, that would be great. Is there for example a way to compute the real root $\gamma$ ?
What is the relation of $\gamma$ to the other complex roots?
What other properties do the numbers $b_n$ have?
etc. Thanks for your help. Edit :
I found a conjectural way to compute $\gamma$ and using the Euler Product a link to Riemann Zeta function: $$\zeta(s) = \prod_{p} {\frac{1}{1-(2+\sum_{q<p} b_{p-1-q})^{-s}}}$$ and for $\gamma$ numerical coincidences suggest that: $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{b_n}{b_{n+1}} = \gamma = -0.629233\cdots$$ which could be one way to define $\gamma$ . Then one has to show, that this limit exists and that $f(\gamma) = 0$ . If someone has an idea in this direction,that would be nice. Second edit :
Here is the computation for the recurence relation of $a_{n,k}$ :
For $k\ge 1$ we have on the one hand: $$\log(f(t)^k)' = \frac{k f(t)^{k-1} f'(t)}{f(t)^k} = k \frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} = \sum_{n=-1}^\infty k b_n t^n$$ On the other hand it is $$f(t)^k  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n,k}t^n$$ which means that $$\log(f(t)^k)' = \frac{\sum_{n=0}^\infty n a_{n,k} t^{n-1}}{\sum_{n=0}^\infty  a_{n,k} t^{n}}$$ Hence it follows, that (by multiplying with the denominator): $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty n a_{n,k} t^{n-1} = k (\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n,k} t^{n}) (\sum_{n=0} b_{n-1}t^n) \frac{1}{t}$$ After multiplying with $t$ and using the Cauchy product formula we get: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n a_{n,k} t^{n} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty k( \sum_{v=0}^n a_{v,k}b_{n-1-v})t^n$$ and comparing coefficients we find that: $$n a_{n,k} = k ( \sum_{v=0}^n a_{v,k} b_{n-1-v})$$ and with $b_{-1} = 2$ it follows after solving this equation for $a_{n,k}$ that: $$ a_{n,k} = \frac{k}{n-2k} \sum_{v=0}^{n-1} a_{v,k} b_{n-1-v}$$ Especially for $k=1$ and $n=p$ prime we find that: $$ p = 2+ \sum_{q<p} b_{p-1-q}$$","['riemann-zeta', 'number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"
3164234,An infinite set has always a countably infinite subset?,"Upon studying cardinality, the statement ""an infinite set has always a countably infinite subset"" seems intuitive to me. Is it really true though? If so, could someone provide a complete, formal proof or even an alternative one? Here is my reasoning: Let $I$ be an infinite set. Now there are two types of infinite sets so we will divide our proof in two cases: $I$ is countably infinite : That is, to say, it has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{N}$ . $$ \vert I \vert = \vert \mathbb{N} \vert $$ Then it must be that $\vert I \vert \leq \vert \mathbb{N} \vert$ and $\vert \mathbb{N} \vert \leq \vert I \vert$ i.e. there is a bijection, say $f$ , such that $f: \mathbb{N} \mapsto I$ . This implies $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N} \subseteq I$ . Therefore, $\mathbb{N}$ is a subset of $I$ . $I$ is not countably infinite : Now, since $I \neq \emptyset$ ; we choose and take out some element $i_1$ from $I$ . As $I \setminus \{i_1\}$ is also not empty( $\vert I \vert = 1$ otherwise), we choose and take out some $i_2$ from $I \setminus \{i_1\}$ . Similarly, continuing we end up with a countably infinite set: $$ I_c = \{i_1, i_2, i_3, \dots\}$$ from $I$ such that $\vert I_c \vert = \vert \mathbb{N} \vert$ . Then it must be that $\vert I_c \vert \leq \vert \mathbb{N} \vert $ and $\vert \mathbb{N} \vert \leq \vert I_c \vert $ . Therefore, a countably infinite set is a subset of $I_c$ . All in all, a countably infinite set is a subset of $I$ where $I$ is an infinite set.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-writing', 'proof-verification', 'alternative-proof']"
