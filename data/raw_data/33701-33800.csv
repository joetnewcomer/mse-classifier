w = \displaystyle\int_{xy}^{2x-3y}du/ln(u)\,du

I know that the general rule for differentiation of integrals of this type goes: $$\frac{d}{dx}\displaystyle\int_{u(x)}^{v(x)}f(t)dt = f(v)\frac{dv}{dx} - f(u)\frac{du}{dx}$$ Using the general rule and substituting partial derivatives for singular derivatives, I found: $$\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} = 1/ln(3)$$ and  $$\frac{\partial w}{\partial y} = -6/ln(3)$$ However, I am at a loss as to how to find the solution to this question as the partial derivative is of the terms that define the integral's interval. Would I be able to consider the equation: $$ \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} =  \frac{\partial y}{\partial w}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} $$ and then say  $$ \frac{\partial y}{\partial w} = 1/\frac{\partial w}{\partial y} $$ Any help would be greatly appreciated.","['partial-derivative', 'calculus', 'integration', 'derivatives']"

320890,countable-uncountable intuition behind a set,"let $Q$ := $\{q_1, ...,q_n,...\}$ be an enumeration of the rationals. let $\epsilon_n$ = $\frac{1}{2^n}$ and let $S_i$ = $(q_i-\epsilon_i, q_i + \epsilon_i)$ Let $S$ be the union of all $S_i$. Take the complement of $S$ in $\mathbb{R}$. I have a few queries about this set. I'm sure they are all somewhat trivial but i've thought a bit about them and the penny still hasn't dropped. Firstly, by considering a geometric series $S$ has maximum length 2. So the complement is infinte. But the complement has no intervals, it's just irrational points. And i can't think of an example of one of these points. If we have an irrational in the complement it is ""between"" two sets, with rational endpoints. these rational endpoints should then have another open set about them, which even if infinitesimal, should cover ""one"" point, our irrational element of the complement. So now our one example of the complement is no longer in the complement. Secondly, once armed with the intuition about what this set really looks and feels like, i wonder about the fact it has infinite lenght. If the set of irrational elements of the set are wedged in between a countable number of open sets, it feels like there should be a countable number of points in the complement if $S$. But then the length would be zero. To phrase the second part of the question more appropriately maybe i could then redefine  $\epsilon_n$ as $\frac{\pi}{2^n}$, and try and argue since the $S_i$ now have irrational endpoints, the only irrationals in the complement can be the endpoints, and this shows they are countable... where am i going wrong?",['elementary-set-theory']

320918,$f_L:X\to\mathbb P^r$ if finite $\Longleftrightarrow L$ is...?,"Suppose we have a line bundle $L$ on an algebraic variety $X$. Let us assume $L$ is globally generated, and let $f_L:X\to \mathbb P^r$ denote the corresponding morphism. Question . Under which condition(s) on $L$ is the morphism $f_L$
  finite? For example, if $X$ is a curve then to give a finite degree $d$ morphism $X\to \mathbb P^1$ (so we fixed $r=1$) is the same as to give a degree $d$ line bundle (plus two independent sections). But I think this readily fails if, for instance, we drop the assumption $r=1$, or the assumption that $X$ is a curve. However, $L$ determines $f_L$ (yes, up to the choice of a basis for the generating sections), so there should be some condition to put directly on $L$ to translate the finiteness of $f_L$. I know this is a very basic question but I am unable to find these conditions.
I only noticed that they should be weaker than ""being very ample"" (because a closed immersion is finite). Moreover, a finite morphism is quasi-finite, so the linear system $|L|$ should be one whose divisors are zero-dimensional subschemes of $X$. Thank you!",['algebraic-geometry']

Now I can't see how to justify this from the previous proof: we just showed that if $\Omega$ is open and bounded, $f\in C^2(\bar \Omega) $, $p \not \in f(\partial \Omega)$
and $|p'-p|<\operatorname{dist}(p,f(\partial \Omega)$ where $p',p $ are regular values of $f$ then $$\operatorname{deg}(f,\Omega,p)=\operatorname{deg}(f,\Omega, p')$$ While what we actually need is that if $g_1,g_2 \in C^2(\bar \Omega)$ and $\max( {|g_1-f|,|g_2-f|)}< d(p, f(\partial \Omega))$ then $$\operatorname{deg}(g_1,\Omega,p)=\operatorname{deg}(g_2,\Omega, p')$$ Essentially we need an homotopy invariance for smooth functions, or am I wrong?

321181,"Pool of acid, optimal path","Evil Dr.Friendless have kidnapped Gregors family and attached them with a bomb.
this bomb will is impossible to unwire unless you use a special key. Which of course Dr.Friendless have placed on inside a monkey at the bottom of a swimming pool he dumped acid into. The pool is given by the equation $$ f(x,y) = - \frac{2}{5}x - 1, \quad x,y \in (0,10) $$ And after a certain time the amount of acid at the point $x,y,z$ is given by the vectorfunction $$ A(x,y,z) = 10- \frac{x}{10} - y - \frac{z}{5} $$ As pointed out Gregor needs to swim from the end of the pool at $(0,0,0)$ to the bottom $(10,10,-5)$ to retrieve the key. If the tries anything fancy as walking around the pool, or using a diving mask Dr.Friendless instantly fries his family. The question now is: What is the optimal path Gregor can swim from $(0,0,0)$ to $(10,10,-5)$ to obtain the least amount of poison? That is to say to minimize the line integral $$ \int_{(0,0,0)}^{(10,10,-5)} A(\overrightarrow{r}(t)) \overrightarrow{\mathbf{r'}}(t)\,\mathrm{d}t $$

321238,"Why not just study the consequences of Hausdorff axiom? What do statements like, ""The arbitrary union of open sets is open,"" gain us?","Define that a pair $(X,\tau)$ where $\tau \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$, is a Hausdorff space if for all distinct $a,b \in X$ there exist $A,B \in \tau$ such that $$a \in A, \;b \in B, \;A \cap B = \emptyset.$$ Note that a Hausdorff space, according to this definition, needn't be a topological space, and vice versa. Call the elements of $\tau$ ""open sets"", whether or not $\tau$ is a topology. Then many of the definitions of topological spaces apply equally well to Hausdorff spaces. In particular, the notion of a convergent sequence can be defined as per usual. In particular, define that a sequence $x : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X$ converges iff there exists $a \in X$ such that for all open $A$ such that $a \in A$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$ it holds that $x_n \in A$. Then we can write this proof to show that every convergent sequence in $X$ has a unique limit. (i.e. $a$ is unique). Presumably, the more general result that every net has a unique limit can also be proven. So why not study limits in arbitrary Hausdorff spaces? What goes wrong when we neglect to assume statements like, ""The arbitrary union of open sets is open""? Edit : So to clarify, my interest lies in the interaction between the topological space axioms and the Hausdorff axiom. What is it about a Hausdorff topological space that is so magical? There must be some sort of synergy going on, or they would have been studied independently of one another. Note that we can define continuity of functions between topological spaces in terms of preimages of open sets. Lets call this ""pre-images continuous."" And we can define continuity of functions between Hausdorff spaces in terms of limits of nets. Lets call this ""limit-continuous."" Perhaps these notions coincide precisely in the case of Hausdorff topological spaces? Note also that the topology generated by a Hausdorff space is necessarily Hausdorff. So for any Hausdorff space $X$, lets $X'$ denote the (necessarily Hausdorff) topological space generated by $X$. Perhaps a function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ between Hausdorff spaces is limit-continuous if and only if $f : X' \rightarrow Y'$ is (open-preimages)-continuous.",['general-topology']

I just spotted another type of symmetry in the second fano plane diagram: $(6\;0)(1\;4)$ and so I can see the entirety of $PSL_2(7) = \langle(1\;2\;5)(3\;6\;4),(1\;5)(3\;4),(6\;0)(1\;4)\rangle$ from that one diagram. how can we see that together the $C_7$ and $D_{2 \cdot 3}$ make $GL_3(2)$ or even better $PSL_2(7)$? or how can we construct the first diagram from $PSL_2(7)$? I was looking at the wikipedia page for Klein quartic and there are dual pictures: tiling of hyperbolic plane by heptagons and triangles.. Can we use this geometry of the diagrams and the 3/7-duality to explain the isomorphism of the matrix groups?","['geometry', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"
321595,How to recover a shuffled matrix,"Suppose that I have a matrix $A$. $A$ can be a rating matrix. That is, $A(i,j)$ is the rating user $i$ has given to item $j$. Suppose that I shuffle the rows and columns of matrix $A$ and get $A_{\text{shuffle}}$. Now, actually, both $A$ and $A_{\text{shuffle}}$ contains the same information. Because shuffling the columns or rows do not change the ratings the users give to items. Is there an efficient way to show that $A$ and $A_{\text{shuffle}}$ contain the same users and items. I.e., as suggested by polkjh,  given matrices $A$ and $B$, how can I check efficiently if $B$ can be obtained by shuffling rows and columns of $A$? Thanks","['matrices', 'computational-complexity']"

So, interior points: a set is open if all the points in the set are interior points. However, if a set has a point inside it, surely it will always have a neighborhood (or a small ball) that will be contained in the set. So, what keeps all the points from being interior points? (points inside the set I mean) Also, second question: is a limit point an interior point? Thank you!","['limits', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

321712,biased coin tossing where each pair of heads is separated by at least l tails.,"Suppose that I have a biased coin where $\Pr[head] = p$ is very small. Let's say I tossed this coin $n$ times and I saw $h$ heads. Then what is the probability that each pair of heads is separated by at least $\ell$ tails? For example, let's say $(n, h, \ell) = (10, 2, 5)$. 'Yes': T H T T T T T T H T There are two heads at location 1 and 9, but they are separated by 6 tails. 'No': T T T T T H T H T T There are two heads at location 6 and 8, but they are separated by only one tail. One possible approach is summing up all the probabilities of 'yes' events.

321714,How can a continuous function map closed sets to open sets (and vice versa)?,"Definition of continuity: A function $f: X \to Y$ (where $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces) is continuous if and only if for any open subset $V$ of $Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$. Now, if $U$ is a closed subset of $X$ (meaning that the complement of $U$, $U^c$ is open and it contains all of its cluster points) and $f(U)$ (the image of $U$ under $f$) $= V$ is open in $Y$, then if $f$ is continuous, $f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}(f(U)) = U$ is open. So if $U$ is closed then this leads to a contradiction. Conversely, if $U$ is open in $X$ and $f(U)=V$ is closed in $Y$, then $V^c$ is open. However, the complement of the preimage $f^{-1}(V)$ is closed since $(f^{-1}(V))^c = U$ which is open; which again leads to a contradiction. If there is anyone who has some valid counterexamples I'd be eager to see them.",['general-topology']
321721,Invertible rational functions,"I am looking for references for the following facts.
$\newcommand{A}{\mathbb{A}}\newcommand{P}{\mathbb{P}}\newcommand{Z}{\mathbb{Z}}\newcommand{Spec}{\mathrm{Spec}}\newcommand{sub}{\subset}\newcommand{O}{\mathscr{O}}$ Let $X$ be an integral scheme and $f \in R(X)$ a rational function with a representative $f : U \to \A^1_\Z$ for some open $U \sub X$.  In the ring $R(X)$, $f$ is invertible if and only if the closure $\overline{f(U)}$ of its image does not contain the point of $\A^1_\Z = \Spec(\Z[T])$ corresponding to the prime ideal $(T) \sub \Z[T]$.  In particular, if $f \in R(X)^*$, then the image $f(\eta)$ of the generic point of $X$ is not equal to $(T)$. Suppose that $X$ is an $S$-scheme, where $S = \Spec(A)$.  To $f$ corresponds a morphism $U \to \A^1_X$; let $g : U \to \P^1_S$ denote the composite with the projection $\A^1_X \to \A^1_S$ and the open immersion $\A^1_S \stackrel{\sim}{\to} D_+(T_0) \hookrightarrow \P^1_S = \mathrm{Proj}(A[T_0,T_1])$.  Then the image $g(\eta)$ of the generic point is not contained in the union $V_+(T_0) \cup V_+(T_1)$ of the closed subschemes cut out by $T_0$ and $T_1$. I have seen these results used implicitly in the Stacks project and other places, but I haven't found a proof (or even a proper statement) in either EGA or the Stacks project itself.  I've written up proofs in detail here ; they seem straightforward, but in my opinion not completely trivial (unless I'm overlooking something), and I'm surprised that the standard sources don't have them.","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
