33852,Bounds for die roll,"Given a $n$-sided fair die, show that the probability $P$ that all faces from $1$ to $11$ show when doing $3n$-rolls is bounded by $1 - 11 \cdot \frac{(n-1)^{3n}}{n^{3n}} \leq P \leq 1 -  11 \cdot \frac{11(n-1)^{3n}}{n^{3n}} + 5 \cdot 11 \cdot \frac{(n-2)^{3n}}{n^{3n}}$ I am really stuck on this one. I figured that the exact probability is very hard to find and stirling numbers are involved. So the only chance I have is to figure out what events where used for that bounds. My guess is that the left one comes from the assumtion that (Edit: Warning this is not quite correct, check the comments ) $\mathbb{P}($Faces 1-11 don't occur at all$)=\frac{|E|}{|Q|}=\frac{11 \cdot (n-1)^{3n}}{n^{3n}}$ And if you look at the complement it is that all faces 1-11 at least occur once.

I need to prove that $\limsup (x_{n}+y_{n})=\lim x_{n}+\limsup y_{n}$, when $n$ tends to $\infty$. I chose $z_{n}=x_{n}+y_{n}$, we know that $z_{n}$ is bounded as being sum of two bounded sequences, so from the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, we know that there is a  subsequence of $z_{n}$,

33889,Calculate relative contribution to percent change,"Let me use a simple example to illustrate my problem. First, assume we are calculating rate $r$ at time $t$ such that $r_t=\frac{x_t}{y_t}$ . Furthermore, each measure has two component parts: $x = x_A +x_B$ and $y = y_A + y_B$ . We can thus calculate percent change $c$ for the rate between $t_2>t_1$ as $c=\frac{r_2-r_1}{r_1}$ . Next, I want to allocate $c$ to measure the relative contribution of each component $A$ and $B$ . When the changes are in the same direction between $t_1$ and $t_2$ this is easy (e.g. $x_{A_1} > x_{A_2}$ and $x_{B_1} > x_{B_2}$ and $y_{A_1} > y_{A_2}$ and $y_{B_1} > y_{B_2}$ ). You calculate the change for each component, divide that by the absolute change and apply that ""share"" to the total percent change. That allows me to make a statement, e.g. when the rate changed from $10\%$ to $15\%$ , $75\%$ of the $50\%$ change was due to component $A$ and $25\%$ to component $B$ . Here's my question: how can I calculate the relative contribution of these components when the differences are in opposite directions? For example, component $A$ decreased for $x$ and $y$ (and more for $y$ , relatively) and component $B$ increased for $x$ and $y$ (and more for $y$ , relatively). I'm sure this is simple but no amount of searching has made me the wiser. If you could point me in the right direction -- or ask questions to better illuminate my subject matter -- I would greatly appreciate your help. Thanks!

I define a measure $D(x) := \max_{i,j} |x_i - x_j|$, which essentially is the maximum discrepancy of any two values in the vector. A paper I'm  currently going through attempts to bound this measure for a certain process. I believe the details are unimportant, except that the sum of all the $x_i$ is $0$ for each $t$. However, the paper goes on to bound another quantity: The variational distance between vector $x$ and the $0$-vector:
$$||x|| = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i |x_i|$$ According to the Wikipedia article on variational distance, the measure $D(x)$ should be the same as the variational distance, but I don't see how this can be the same.","['statistics', 'measure-theory']"

33930,Showing that a set X with a trivial topology is not metrizable,"This exercise is from a ""challenge"" list that my analysis teacher gave us to do: Let $X$ be a set. There are two trivial topologies: Indiscrete (not sure if this is the actual name, as I am translating from another language) Topology: the open sets are exactly $X$ and the empty set. Discrete Topology: every subset of $X$ is open. Deduce that the indiscrete topology is not metrizable and the discrete topology is metrizable. My problem is that this is a ""first/second"" course in real analysis and no one in the class has seen topology and metric spaces beyond the basics, so I pretty much have no idea of how to do this. Suggestions on how to prove this (proofs itself are not needed) will be very much appreciated.

Is there a name for this type of relation? I am thinking of using the name ""partly reflexive"".
I prefer this to ""partially reflexive""  because the set $X$ will usually be a partially ordered set.
In case it matters this property will be used to define a generalization of the notion of extreme subset. In the context of extreme subsets the property says: if $x$ is an extreme subset of $y$ then $x$ is an extreme subset of $x$ and $y$ is an extreme subset of $y$. If there is no common name for this property and you can think of a better name I would appreciate that.

34054,Symmetric matrix decomposition with orthonormal basis of non-eigenvectors,"I like to understand the following transformation found in documentation for deriving Kalman filter . Abstract Formulation : Given 2 symmetric matrices $A$ ,$B$ $\in$  $\mathbb R^{3,3}$ with $A \ne B$ and a set of orthonormal Eigenvectors ($u_1$, $u_2$, $u_3$) from some other matrix $B$ (not $A$!). Because the matrices are symmetric it is clear that $B$ can be decomposed to $B = U\Lambda U^t$. 
Now there is stated that A can be written as: $A$ = ($u_1^t$A$u_1$)$u_1$$u_1^t$ + ($u_2^t$A$u_2$)$u_2$$u_2^t$ + ($u_3^t$A$u_3$)$u_3$$u_3^t$ i.e. with the ""foreign"" Eigenvectors. Concrete Situation : In the original equation the above mentioned $A$ is defined as $H_kP_k^-H_k^t$ + $R_a$, where $P^-$ is the a priori estimation error covariance and $R_a$ is the sensor noise error covariance matrix. $H_k$ has 3x9 dimension and contains some ""more abstract"" content with rotation matrix of a quaternion multiplied with cross product operator of gravity vector (0,0,g). As far as I can see, the term ($H_kP_k^-H_k^t$ + $R_a$) does not lead to a diagonal matrix and this seems to be irrelevant. What I called $B$ is actually the signal's overall error error covariance named $U_k$ From original paper: Because $U_k$ covariance matrix cannot be obtained at this point in time (a priori estimation), it is approximated by the average of the last M steps i.e. from k-M to k-1. The signal itself might be fluctuating considerably because sometimes there is external acceleration at other times there isn't thus sensor noise is the only thing be measured. Assumption (thanks to Calle's and joriki's comments): The eigendecomposition of $U_k$ is related to PCA Principal component analysis (an easier one here ). The most interesting cases are all those measurements with strong accelerations i.e. $U_k$ is much greater than the remaining term. So this decomposition of the 2nd term transforms it (approximatively?) towards the direction of the strongest signal. Thus $\lambda - \mu$ helps to detect these situations respectively distinguish them from phases with no signal aside from noise. Does this explanation makes sense? Can this procedure of approximating with ""wrong"" eigenvectors and -values be applied and compares like with like? What is the name of this matrix

The general element of a möbius transform that preserves the extended real line is any one of the four möbius transforms of the following kind (I'll only state one) $m(z)= \frac{az+b}{cz+d}, a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R}$ and $ad-bc = 1$ . Now let $p$ be a möbius transform that maps the extended real line to the unit circle. It can be shown that the choice of $p$ does not matter, so i'll just take $p(z) = \frac{z-i}{z+i}$ . Any möbius transform that preserves the unit circle is of the form $p \circ m \circ p$ , where $m$ is any one of the möbius transforms that preserves the extended real line, $\mathbb{\bar{R}}$ . Of course to check if a point in the unit circle still remains in the unit circle, I'll have to check and if it does not I can apply combine the above with $K(z) = \frac{-1}{z}$ . The problem With many choices of $m$ in fact for all 4 I would have to check and write down $p^{-1} (z)$ and do compositions of functions and other things.

the coefficient of $z$ is a complex number that is within the disk (as what is asked to be proved). Is there a simpler way?","['hyperbolic-geometry', 'mobius-transformation', 'complex-analysis']"
34073,Expected travel time for regularly departing trains,"I'm going to ask a very simple practical question, but I believe it has some interesting mathematical properties. The simple variant is: trains depart every $x$ minutes and take $y$ minutes to arrive at the destination. How long should a rider expect his journey to take (waiting plus travel)? The more complex variant is: $n$ train lines service the stop. Each of the $i \in \{1, 2, ... n\}$ lines has trains departing every $x_{i}$ minutes and takes $y_{i}$ minutes to arrive at the destination. Assume arrival times are uncorrelated and random across lines. If the rider takes the first train on any line, what is the expected journey time? The final, most complex variant: it may be the case that taking the first train on any line is not optimal. (For example, if one of the train lines takes $y_{j} = 30$ minutes to arrive at the next stop while others take 20 minutes, and the waiting times are such that it doesn't make sense to take the slower train anyway.) Unfortunately I'm at a total loss for how to compute this, practically speaking. Mathematically it's minimizing the expectation over all subsets of $\{1, 2, ... n\}$, but I need to actually compute it so any tips would be helpful.

Since $(0,0)$ belongs to the closure in $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ of both $S_1$ and $S_2$, the sets $S_1 \cup \{(0,0)\}$ and $S_2 \cup \{(0,0)\}$ are connected. Since these sets have a point in common, their union $$(S_1 \cup \{(0,0)\}) \cup (S_2 \cup \{(0,0)\})$$ is connected. This union is the graph of the function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)=\sin(\frac{1}{x})$, $x \neq 0$, $f(0)=0$, which is not continuous at $x=0$. In this example, what I don't understand is why $(0,0)$ belongs to the closure of $S_1$ and $S_2$. As I know, the function $f(x)$ vibrates strongly near $0$, so how can the graph get near $(0,0)$? How can $(0,0)$ be in the closure of the two sets? Many thanks!",['functions']

The mirror is attached on the surface of a cylinder, and the spin is relative to the cylinder's center. In this new situation, $b$ is function of $c$.

34195,Is there a nice way to characterize this subset of $Z_n$?,"This is a problem I played around with several years ago.

It is possible to have $x = y$. Example 1. $n=15$, $S_1=\{1,2,6,7,10,11,12,13\}$.  Then $n$ and $S_1$ have the focal point $8$ because $1+7 = 2+6 = 10+13 = 11+12 = 8$.  By exhaustion one can show that there are no others. Example 2: $n=15$, $S_2=\{1,2,6,7,11,12,13\}$.  These have no focal points, even though $S_2$ is simply $S_1$ with $10$ removed.  In fact, removing any element from $S_1$ results in a set that has no focal points with $n$. Example 3: $n = 15$, $S_3=\{1,2,6,7,11,12\}$.  $S_3$ is obtained by removing both $10$ and $13$ from $S_1$.  $S_3$ and $n$ have 3 focal points: $3, 8$, and $13$. Let $F(n,S)$ be the set of focal points of $n$ and $S$.  My questions are these: What can we say about the size of $F(n,S)$?  I was able to prove that it must be $0$ or a divisor of $n$, but surely one can say more. Even better, is there a nice way to characterize $F(n,S)$? My hunch is that the right algebraic structure will make what's going on here crystal clear.  Unfortunately, my algebra is quite rusty. Added : One thing to observe is that in the case of Example 3, $S_3$ splits nicely into residue classes $\bmod 5$: $\{1, 6, 11\}$ and $\{2, 7, 12\}$.  If $n_4 = 5$ and $S_4 = \{1,2\}$, then clearly $n_4$ and $S_4$ have one focal point: $3$.  Surely it's not a coincidence, then, that $n_3 = 15$ and $S_3=\{1,2,6,7,11,12\}$ have 3 focal points.

So $n$ has to map to $n$ (for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$), and $\frac{1}{n}$ maps to $\frac{1}{n}$, so $\frac{n}{m}$ maps to itself, so the only possible automorphism is the identity.  Is this true or am I deceiving myself?  Because I feel like there should definitely be more automorphisms of $\mathbb{Q}$. Also, if you have some extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ (call it $E$), does every automorphism of $E$ automatically fix $\mathbb{Q}$?",['abstract-algebra']

How to get the closed form of f(x)? I tried the Laplace transform to work on it, say $F(s) = L(f(x)) $, but because of $e^{A+Bx}$, there will be a term $F(s-B)$ in the transformed equation. How to deal with this term? I also tried the power series method, but got some very complicate coefficients, which stops me going further. I think the term $e^{A+Bx}$ is the difficult part.

34237,The 9 Billion Names of God,"TLDR; I go on a math adventure and get overwhelmed :) Some background: My maths isn't great (I can't read notation) but I'm a competent programmer and reasonable problem solver. I've done the first dozen or so Euler problems and intend to continue with that when I have time. The problem: In Arthur C Clarke's story ""The 9 Billion Names of God"" the names of God are all possible sequences in an unspecified alphabet, having no more than nine characters, where no letter occurs more than three times in succession. Out of curiosity, I started playing around with determining how many valid sequences there are in a range. I started with digits repeating in base 10 numbers, at heart it's the same problem as letters repeating in an alphabet. Not being very knowledgable about math, I thought I'd write a program iterate over ranges and count all the elements that match the above condition, then put the results in a spreadsheet to see if a clear pattern of some kind emerged that would let me write an algorithm to determine the number of valid sequences in a given range. I started with the constraint that a digit could only appear once, so in the range 0-99 there are 9 invalid sequences, 11, 22, 33 etc., leaving 91 valid 'names of God'. Here's the table for 0-99 through 0-99999999. I stopped there because beyond that's where it started taking to long to calculate and I didn't want to get sidetracked optimizing. 0-99              91
0-999            820

Going from there, looking at all sorts of different things, amongst them the sequences of numbers in different placeholder columns in the tables, differences between numbers in different columns and/or tables etc. I looked at all sorts of things, I wish I'd documented it more, I was just idly mucking around with a spreadsheet and Googling sequences.

But here they give examples of non-trivial line bundles on affine varieties. Where is my reasoning fallacious? Is it because the trivialising opens for the vector bundle can be non-affine?

When I move further away from the camera by increasing x, I want the weight to decrease ($c$ < 1). $c$ is a constant value (like 0.9). Solving it via a Riemann sum is not efficient enough on the Xbox. Therefore, I want to solve it analytically. However, as there is a norm of vectors involved together with some other ugly parts, I don't really know where to start solving this. Is it possible to solve this integral analytically? (If yes, how?) Is there a way to approximate this integral by using non-uniform step-sizes using some Riemann-style integration to increase efficiency of my current implementation? Maybe some other solutions?

(Is it the only complex analytic function that is an extension? No, but with a few more restrictions, we can make $\Gamma(z)$ the ""only"" answer to the perfect interpolation question about $n!$.) Naïvely, I look at the first few values of the partition number $p(n)$, and want to do the same thing. But, the partitions have no simple explicit formula; that's part of their mystery! Emory math professor Ken Ono explains the state of things in this video . ( Here is the relevant paper, as well.) There are some details that I still do not understand about the paper, but in the final steps before Bruinier and Ono give their explicit formula, they introduce a method that only makes sense when applied to a natural number, so we get a very cool formula... but not something that gives us a way of thinking about $p(z)$; it's still $p(n)$. So, my question is this: is this a fool's errand? Can we say that there will never be a meaning for something like $p(2.6)$ or $p(3-\pi i)$? I think that this could be the case, because, if such an interpretation existed, then the problem of counting partitions would be much easier than it has proven to be thus far.","['integer-partitions', 'special-functions', 'number-theory']"

To help make this question more manageable, let me give you some examples from the text: 1) $T(9x+5) = (.1,.2)$ and $T(7x+4) = (.3,.8)$. This is a unique linear b/c $(4a-7b)(9x+5) + (9b-5a)(7x+4)$ will equal ... [do some foiling] ... $= ax +b$ for all $a$, $b$ real. Q: mmm, so what about $(4a-7b)(9x+5) + (9b-5a)(7x+4)$ will equal ... [do some foiling] ... = $ax +b$ for all $a,b$ real' tells me this is a unique linear transformation? Even more fundamentally, just looking at the example problem it seems we have 2 transformations. So if we were going to look for a unique transformation shouldn't we only look at $T(9x+5)$ and/or $T(7x+4)$ individually. Or if we wanted to look at them both should we be asking if a new (unlisted) transformation $T^*$ (which is $T(9x+5+7x +4)$) is a unique linear transformation? Perhaps, I'm just not really clear on what exactly we are finding the linear transformation of. 2) $T(2,1) = 4x +5$; $T(6,3) = 12x +15$. Not unique because $T(a, b) = 2ax + 5b$ works, but so does $T(a,b) = 4bx + (3a - b)$. Q: Again, what specifically are we finding the linear transformation of? Where does $2ax + 5b$ and $4bx + (3a - b)$ comes from? How did the author arrive at it? I'm just not sure on how to interpret these equations? That's it. Yes, I know my questions were probably confused (for I am). But I'm looking for anything to help give me clarity.

I have classmates for that.)","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
34424,Finitely generated field extensions,"If $F=K(u_1,\ldots,u_n)$ is a finitely generated extension of $K$ and $M$ is an intermediate field, then $M$ is a finitely generated extension of $K$. I'm not exactly sure how to start this problem. Any help at all would be a tremendous help.","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
