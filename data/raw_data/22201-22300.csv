189876,Help Understanding Spectral Method for solving Differential Equations,"I've posted a more detailed version of this question here : SE-ComputationalSci but I'm really struggling with a simpler and related question. Lets say one wants to solve (I made this equation up, right now) $F''(x) - F'(x) + x^2 F(x) = \lambda F(x)$, and you are given the boundary conditions $F(0)=F(X) =0$. The domain of $x$ is $(0,X)$. Now, if I want to use a spectral method, where I expand my functions in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. I would want to do something like this: 1) Change the domain, introduce $y = 2(x/X) -1$ then I would do 2) Express $F (x) = \Sigma_0^{\infty} f_i T_i(y)- \frac{1}{2}f_0$ , where $T_i$ are my Chebyshev polynomials. 3) Use the orthogonality of the polynomials to get set of algebraic equations to solve for $F(x)$. My question is what do I do with the $x^2$ term in my original equation. Do I rewrite that in terms of $y$, or do I define a new function $x^2*F(x) = G(x)$ and then try to work out how the expansion coefficients for $G(x)$ would be related to $f_i$? I may just be missing the whole idea of the spectral method, in the first place. The goal of understanding this better would be to reproduce the spectral method used in Appendix A of this paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0210102.pdf Thanks for any answers, and help.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'special-functions']"
189881,Proof to motivate the need for measure theoretic probability,"Im using Billingsley's Probability and Measure.  In lecture the instructor motivated the need for measure theory in probability by providing a solution to the following problem : Show that a discrete probability space cannot contain an infinite sequence $A_1, A_2,...$ of independent events, each of probability $\frac{1}{2}$.  This is exercise 1.1a in the text. My thought is that such a sequence may be interpreted as a dyadic expansion of some real number in the unit interval, thus the probability space must be unaccountably infinite.  Of course this is not rigorous and it differs from the approach suggested by the author.  The problem notes give the following hint: ""Each point lies in one of the four sets $A_1 \cap A_2$, $A_1^c \cap A_2$, $A_1 \cap A_2^c$, $A_1^c \cap A_2^c$ and hence would have probability at most $2^{-2}$; continue."" I'm not sure I see where he is going with this.  Of course as the sequence goes infinite, the probability of any set goes to zero, but how does this prove the space cannot be discrete?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'probability']"

189897,Do absolute values of differentiable functions with roots always exhibit cusps?,"I am interested in the following question because I am hoping to be surprised by an exotic counterexample. Conjecture: Let $x=a$ be a root of a differentiable function $f$ such that $f(x)>0$ for $k<x<a$ and $f(x)<0$ for $a<x<q$, where $k, q \in \mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm \infty\}$. Then $x=a$ is a cusp of $|f(x)|$. I am essentially conjecturing that if you have a differentiable function $f$ which is non-constant around one of it's roots, then the absolute value function of $f$ will be non-differentiable at the root of $f$ specified. Would anyone be able to think of a proof sketch for this claim, or suggest a counterexample?","['calculus', 'analysis']"

Then there is some irreducible character $\chi$ such that $\chi(x) \not = \chi(y)$. Clearly the ""irreducible"" part isn't important, since any character can be written as the sum of irreducible characters, but I'm having trouble going beyond that.

190013,Portmanteau theorem for vague convergence,"I would like to investigate if an analog of the classical Portmanteau theorem holds for vague convergence of Radon measures. Here are the definitions I'm using. Let $X$ be a Hausdorff locally compact topological space, and let $\mathcal{B}(X)$ be its Borel $\sigma$-algebra.
A positive measure $\mu$ on $(X, \mathcal{B}(X))$ is said to be a Radon measure if : 
(i) $\mu(K) < \infty$ for all compact subsets $K \subset X$, (ii) $\mu(O) = \sup \, \{\mu(K) \, / \, K \subset O, K \rm{\: is \: compact \:} \}$ for all open subsets $O \subset X$, and 
(iii) $\mu(A) = \inf \, \{ \mu(O) \, / \, A \subset O, O \rm{\: is \: open \:} \}$ for every Borel subset $A \subset X$. I will say that a sequence $(\mu_n)_n$ of Radon measures on $X$ converges vaguely to a Radon measure $\mu$ if $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f \, d \mu_n = \int_X f \, d \mu$ for all $f \in C_c(X)$, where $C_c(X)$ denotes the set of all continuous real-valued functions defined on $X$, with a compact support. Now, consider the following propositions : $(P_1)$ $(\mu_n)_n$ converges vaguely to $\mu$; $(P_2)$ $\mu(O) \le \underline{ \lim } \, \mu_n(O)$ for all open subsets $O \subset X$; $(P_3)$ $\mu(K) \ge \overline{ \lim } \, \mu_n(K)$ for all compact subsets $K \subset X$; $(P_4)$ $\mu(A) = \lim \, \mu_n(A)$ for all Borel subsets $A \subset X$ with a compact closure, and satisfying $\mu(\partial A) = 0$. I'm able to prove that $(P_1) \Leftrightarrow ((P_2) + (P_3)) \Rightarrow (P_4)$. My questions are : 1) Are $(P_2)$ and $(P_3)$ equivalent in full generality ? If $X$ is compact, this is obvious by taking complementary sets. 2) Can one prove that $(P_4) \Rightarrow (P_1)$ ? I succeeded to prove that $(P_3) + (P_4) \Rightarrow (P_1)$.

190312,Why the weak * topology on the dual of a Banach space has the stronger meaning of locally compact,"Let us say that for a Hausdorff topological space to be locally compact means that every point has a compact neighborhood.  Why do locally compact have the property that if $x \in U$ and $U$ is open in $X$, then $x$ has a compact neighborhood that is contained in $U$?  If this is not true, which I suspect, then at least it should be true for the spectrum of an abelian C* algebra, as hinted by a proof in Takesaki where he uses this fact without proof.  Recall the spectrum is the set of (nonzero) multiplicative linear functionals on a C* algebra.  Perhaps the level of generality at which locally compact implies the stronger version of locally compact is in between.  Perhaps it holds for some subsets of the dual of a Banach space?","['general-topology', 'operator-algebras', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"

190321,Parametric curve of intersection - line integral with respect to arc length,"This comes from Apostol's Calculus, Vol. II, Section 10.9 #14: A uniform wire has the shape of that portion of the curve of intersecion of the two surfaces $x^2+y^2=z^2$ and $y^2=x$ connecting the points $(0,0,0)$ and $(1,1,\sqrt 2)$. Find the $z$-coordinate of its centroid. The $z$-coordinate of the centroid is defined as $\dfrac {\int_C z\, \mathrm ds}{\int_C \mathrm ds}$, where $s(t)$ is the arc length. (That is, if $\vec\alpha(t)$ is a parametrization of $C$, $s(t)=\int \lVert \vec \alpha \,' (t) \rVert \mathrm d t$.) One valid parametrization of the curve is $$\vec \alpha(t)=\left(t^2,\, t,\, t\sqrt {t^2+1}\right)\,,$$
however this becomes quite difficult to work with. In fact, Mathematica can only numerically integrate $\int_C \mathrm ds= \int_0^1 \lVert \vec \alpha\, '(t) \rVert\, \mathrm dt$. I thought perhaps using a substitution like $t=\tan(\theta)$ would be helpful, but obviously if this was viable Mathematica would have performed this simple substitution in the first place. My question is, specifically for this problem, is there a nicer parametrization that I am missing? Hints appreciated . I have tried solving $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$ and using the resulting parametrization, but it is no better. In case it is helpful, the book's answer is

Suppose $[a,b]\subset\mathbb{R}$ and $f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a strictly increasing non-vanishing continuous function. Suppose $g:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function which is orthogonal to all powers of $f$, i.e. is such that $\int_a^bg(x)(f(x))^n\,dx=0$ (Riemann integrals) for $n=1,2,3,\ldots$. Show that $g(x)=0$ for all $x\in[a,b]$. Since I could not think of how to solve this problem, I considered something simpler. I know that if $f(x)=x$, then we have $\int_a^bg(x)x^n\,dx=0$ for all $n$. Applying the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem to $g$, we obtain a sequence of polynomials $(p_n)$ such that $p_n\rightarrow g$ uniformly. Therefore, by linearity of the integral, we have
$$\int_a^bg(x)p_n(x)\,dx=0$$
for all $n$. Thus
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_a^bg(x)p_n(x)\,dx=\int_a^b(g(x))^2\,dx=0.$$
Since $g$ is continuous, the result follows. But, obviously, this is not an answer to the stated question... Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",['real-analysis']

Thus, the integral $I_n$ of a closed counterclockwise contour around any one of the $z=\pi n$ points should yield $2\pi i (-1)^{n}$ respectively. Now, for instance we can integrate a closed contour in the following way: $$I_n=\lim_{\epsilon \to 0}(A(\epsilon)+B(\epsilon)+C(\epsilon)+D(\epsilon))$$ where $$A(\epsilon)=\int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon}\frac{1}{\sin(\pi n +x-i\epsilon)}dx \text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ , }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }B(\epsilon)=\int_{-i\epsilon}^{i\epsilon}\frac{1}{\sin(\pi n +y+\epsilon)}dy$$ $$C(\epsilon)=\int_{\epsilon}^{-\epsilon}\frac{1}{\sin(\pi n +x+i\epsilon)}dx\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ , }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }D(\epsilon)=\int_{i\epsilon}^{-i\epsilon}\frac{1}{\sin(\pi n +y-\epsilon)}dy$$ These partial integrals can be done, since we know the primitive: $$F(z)=\ln\left(\sin\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)\right)-\ln\left(\cos\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)\right)\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ where }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }F'(z)=f(z)$$ However, after A, B, C and D are integrated out, their sum adds to zero, in contradiction to the expected result of $2\pi i (-1)^{n}$. Apparently, the approach above contains some mistake? What would be a correct approach to obtain the right result but integrating an explicit contour?",['complex-analysis']
190604,Exercise 1.1.18 in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology,"Background I am currently trying to solve exercise 1.1.18 in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology. The part of the exercise I am interested in is the following: Using the technique in the proof of Proposition 1.14, show that if a space $X$ is obtained from a path-connected subspace $A$ by attaching an n-cell $e^n$ with $n ≥ 2$, then the inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ induces a surjection on $\pi_1$ . I know that $i:A \hookrightarrow X$ induces a homomorphism $i_*:\pi_1(A)\rightarrow \pi_1(X)$, so I only need to show this is a surjection. I think I understand the idea of the proof, which is to show that every loop $f\in \pi_1(X)$ is homotopic to a loop which is contained entirely in $A$. Hatcher's suggestion is to follow the proof $\pi_1(S^n)=0$ for $n\geq 2$, meaning that we should be able to push the sections of $f$ which are in the attached $n$-cell $e^n$ out. This is causing me a bit of trouble. Attempt Since $X$ is defined to be the result of attaching an $n$-cell to $A$ via some attaching map $\varphi:\partial D^n\rightarrow X$, it has the form $X=A \amalg e^n/\sim$, where $x\sim \varphi(x)$ for all $x \in \partial D^n$. Note first that since $A$ and $e^n$ are path connected, the adjunction space $X=A\cup_\varphi e^n$ is path connected. As such, our choice of base point does not affect the structure of $\pi_1(X)$, so let $x_0 \in A$ be the base point of $\pi_1(X)$ we are working over. Let $f \in \pi_1(X,x_0)$. Let $E=\text{Int}(e^n)$ and consider $f^{-1}(E)$. This is an open subset of $(0,1)$, so it is the union of a possibly infinite collection of subsets of $(0,1)$ of the form $(a_i,b_i)$. Let $f_i$ denote the restriction of $f$ to $(a_i,b_i)$. Note that $f_i$ lies in $e^n$ and, in particular, $f(a_i)$ and $f(b_i)$ lie on the boundary of $e^n$, so they are elements of $A$. For $n\geq 2$ we can homotopy $f_i$ to the path $g_i$ from $f(a_i)$ to $f(b_i)$ that goes along the boundary of $e^n$, which is homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}$, so it is path connected for $n\geq 2$. Since $e^n$ is homeomorphic to $D^n$, where $n\geq 2$, it is simply connected so $f_i$ and $g_i$ are homotopic. Repeating this process for all $f_i$, we obtain a loop $g$ homotopic to $f$ such that $g(I)\subseteq A$. What really bothers me about this is how I could homotopy form a homotopy from $f$ to $g$ consisting of possibly infinitely many individual homotopies from $f_i$ to $g_i$. I believe I need there to only be finitely many $f_i's$, but I don't see how to show it. Note: This is not homework.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

190698,Proving the odd integer power function is injective over the reals,"I am taking Abstract Algebra and in the first assignment we were asked to determine which values of $n$ make the following function injective. $f: \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ $x \mapsto x^n$ $| n \in \mathbb{N^+}$ Obviously the case where $n$ is even is quite easy to disprove. For the odd case I had a more difficult time. I understand that I could use the fact that the odd functions are continuous and because their derivative is positive everywhere (besides 0 which is dealt with separately), the function is increasing so $a > b \implies f(a) > f(b)$ which would prove it was injective. However, I do not think this is the proper way to go about it, as we have not and will not cover continuity and those sort of things. Not to mention this method seems out of place with the other problems in the homework which all deal with equivalence relations and general set theory questions.

$$A=B^{-1}I_n=B^{-1}\\A=I_nC^{-1}=C^{-1}\\C^{-1}=B^{-1}\\C=B$$ So, I am not sure about this one because I am using the inverse of a matrix, but I am told to only use the properties of multiplication.
