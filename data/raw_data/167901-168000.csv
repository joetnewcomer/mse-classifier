2935922,"For $\alpha \in ]-1, 1[$, how to show that sequence $(u_{n + 1} - \alpha u_n)$ converges implies $(u_n)$ converges?","Let be $\alpha \in ]-1, 1[$ and $(u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ a real-valued sequence. Let us suppose that $(u_{n + 1} - \alpha u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges. How to show that $(u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges? What I tried: Work on $u_{n + 1} - u_n = (\alpha - 1) u_n + L + o(1)$ for some $L \in \mathbb{R}$ which would be the limit of $(u_{n + 1} - \alpha u_n)_n$ and use some kind of Cesaro sommation technique. Consider the set of limits of all subsequences of $(u_n)_n$ and show that its lower bound is its upper bound (unsuccessful).","['limits', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
2935928,Complex numbers bijection when solving a series,"When looking for a closed form of the series: $$S=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\sin{(n)}}{n!}$$ Using complex numbers the solution is very elegant and easy: $$S=\Im\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{e^{in}}{n!}\right)=\Im{\left(\Large{e^{e^i}}\right)}=e^{\cos{1}}\sin(\sin{1})$$ So I wondered how is that complex numbers simplify so much such a problem, so I started trying alternative methods to find the bijection between complex numbers and some operation or transformation. First thing I thought about was that if we call the derivative operator $D$ , we have that: $$D^2\cos{t}=-\cos{t} $$ $$D^2\sin{t}=-\sin{t} $$ Therefore in this context we have that $D^2=-I$ , so I started looking for differential equations. I called the functions: $$y(t)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{sin{(tn)}}{n!}$$ $$x(t)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{cos{(tn)}}{n!}$$ Now the problem is to solve the following system with initial conditions $x(0)=e \text{, } \space y(0)=0$ and evaluate $y(t)$ in $t=1$ : $$y'=x\cos{t}-y\sin{t}$$ $$x'=-y\cos{t}-x\sin{t}$$ Using the subs $x=R(t)\cos(\theta (t))$ and $y=R(t)\sin(\theta (t))$ I get the answer: $$y(t)=e^{\cos{t}}\sin(\sin{t})$$ $$x(t)=e^{\cos{t}}\cos(\sin{t})$$ So my question is regarding another possible bijection that I am thinking of, is the one that pops out of the modulus and argument. So one could find the functions by showing that the following expressions are true: $$x^2(t)+y^2(t)=e^{2\cos{t}}$$ $$\frac{y(t)}{x(t)}=\tan{(\sin{t})}$$ I tried but failed, and with complex numbers this is so easy to show...so the question is how can we show these expressions without using complex numbers. Any discussion on the topic or alternative methods will be useful and appreciated.","['complex-analysis', 'sequences-and-series']"
2935943,"If $X \subseteq R^n$ generates the null space of $A \in M_{m,n}(R)$, does it still generate the null space when we pass to an extension ring?","Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $A$ an $m \times n$ matrix with entries in $R$ . In other, words, an $R$ -linear map $R^n \to R^m$ . Let $K =\ker(A) \subseteq R^n$ and suppose that $X$ is a finite $R$ -generating set for $K$ . Now suppose that $S$ is a commutative ring containing $R$ as a subring (I'm assuming $R$ and $S$ are unital with the same unit). We may also regard $A$ as a matrix with entries in $S$ i.e. a map $S^n \to S^m$ . So now, we have another (larger) kernel to consider. The kernel $K'$ of $A$ considered as a map $S^n \to S^m$ . Question: Is $X$ still an $S$ -generating set for $K'$ ? Or, equivalently, is $K'$ generated by $K = K' \cap R^n$ ? I only really care about the case where $X$ is finite, i.e. $K$ is finitely-generated over $R$ . In fact, $R$ can be Noetherian. I'm not sure how relevant that would be here though. In the linear algebra setting, i.e. when $R$ and $S$ are fields, this is pretty obvious. You can think of it as a consequence of the Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm. Indeed, if you bring $A$ to echelon form over $R$ , then that must also be the echelon form over $S$ (by uniqueness) so the basis for the null space which you read off from the echelon form works for either $R$ or $S$ . I don't know much about commutative algebra, but I think this also has to hold in the case where $A$ is surjective. Then, applying $\otimes_R S$ to $$ 0 \to K \to R^n \overset{A}{\to} R^m \to 0 $$ gives $$ \cdots \to \mathrm{Tor}_1^R(R^m,S) \to \ker_R(A) \otimes_R S \to S^n \overset{A}{\to} S^m \to 0$$ and the Tor group above is zero, because $R^m$ is projective, so we see that $\ker_R(A) \otimes_R S$ coincides with $K'$ , as needed. So what do you think, does this hold in general? And, do we really need any commutative algebra tools to prove it if so? I feel like, because the statement is so transparent in the field case, if it is true in general it should hold for some fairly transparent reason.","['modules', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"

2935977,How to know that $2n^3+9n^2+13n+6$ factors into $(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)$?,"Apologies in advance, my math is very rusty. I'm slowly working my way through Schaum's Outline of Discrete Math for some self-study, occasionally filling in large knowledge gaps in my grasp on algebra. In one of the supplementary questions I'm asked to prove (by induction) that: $$
\sum^n_{i=1}i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
$$ In the inductive step I add $(n+1)^2$ to either side and then try to work my way through, multiplying out the factors: $$
\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + (n+1)^2 \\
= \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)+6(n+1)^2}{6} \\
= \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)+6(n+1)^2}{6} \\
= \frac{2n^3+n^2+2n^2+n+6(n^2+2n+1)}{6} \\
= \frac{2n^3+n^2+2n^2+n+6n^2+12n+6}{6} \\
= \frac{2n^3+9n^2+13n+6}{6}
$$ I think everything up to this point is pretty trivial, but it's around this point that I get a bit lost. I know I need to factor the terms in the 3-degree polynomial in the numerator somehow, but I'm having a hard time with the actual mechanics given the lack of obvious common factors & the fact that 13 is prime. I'm pretty sure the final result should look something like: $$
\frac{(n+1)((n+1)+1)(2(n+1)+1)}{6} \\
= \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6}

\frac{2n^3+9n^2+13n+6}{6} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6}

2935979,Is the normal bundle invariant under homotopy?,"Let $(M^{2n},J)$ be a complex $n$ -manifold and $u:\mathbb{CP}^1\to M$ an immersed $J$ -holomorphic curve. Then there exists a short exact sequence of vector bundles $$0\to T\mathbb{CP}^1\to u^{\ast}TM\to N_u\to 0$$ which defines the normal bundle $N_u$ of $u$ . By Grothendieck's theorem, $$N_u=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n-1}\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{CP}^1}(a_i)$$ where $$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}a_i=c_1(u^{\ast}TM)-2. \qquad \qquad\qquad (\star)$$ Question: Suppose $v:\mathbb{CP}^1\to M$ is another $J$ -holomorphic curve which is homotopic to $u$ and let $b_1,\dots,b_{n-1}$ be the defined by $$N_v=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n-1}\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{CP}^1}(b_i).$$ Is it true that $b_i=a_i$ for all $i=1,\dots,n-1$ ? Comments: Note that the answer is ""yes"" in the case $n=2$ , since then there is only one unknown $a_1$ and $(\star)$ gives $a_1=c_1(u^{\ast}TM)-2$ . I'n not sure if this is true in higher dimensions. Perhaps a counterexample can be constructed when $\pi_2(M)=0$ and all such curves are homotopic, e.g. $M=\mathbb{C}^3$ . The question is essentially how the normal bundle can change within a given homotopy class.","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'symplectic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

I checked the answer and the favorable cases are supposed to be: $$\sum_{k=26}^{52}(n-1)!(52-n)!\binom{26}{n-26}\cdot 13.$$ So I guess this ugly sum divided by $(52)!$ is equal to $1/2,$ right? PS: Question : Answer:","['combinatorics', 'probability']"

What is the probability that P (all men go to their own tents) P (3 go their own tent, and 1 to a foreign one) P (2 go their own tent, and 2 to a foreign one) P (1 go their own tent, and 3 to a foreign one) P (all men are mistaken) My attempt: P (all men go to their own tents) = 1/4 * 1/3 * 1/2 * 1 = 1/24 = 0.04167 because the P (1 man finds his tent) = 1/4, then the P the next one gets it right is 1/3 because he can go to one less place, etc. P (3 go their own tent, and 1 to a foreign one) = 0 because impossible P (2 go their own tent, and 2 to a foreign one) = (4! / (2!*2!)) / 4! = 6/24 =  0.25 because we need to select two men who go to their right place, two that do not, and (in the denominator:) they can altogether be placed 4! different ways. P (1 go their own tent, and 3 to a foreign one) = (4! / 1!*3!) / 4! = 4/24 = 0.16667 because the same logic as no.3. P (all men are mistaken) = 3/4 * 2/3 * 1/2 * 1 = 6/24 = O.25 because the P that the first man goes to a wrong place is 3/4, the probability that the second one goes to a wrong place is one less: 2/3, etc. Question: But there is something wrong with my attempt as the probabilities do not add up to 100%.

(I was not able to locate an independent source for the Frobenius groups of order $100$ , and my results agree with the OEIS up to order $99$ .) The three groups that I am finding are Frobenius are those with small group IDs [[100, 3], [100, 11], [100, 12]]. In each of these cases, I get the following: the Frobenius kernel $K$ is the (necessarily abelian) Sylow $5$ -subgroup, which is also the Fitting subgroup. This is (uniquely, up to conjugacy) complemented, by Schur-Zassenhaus. (For SmallGroup(100,3), $K\simeq C_{25}$ , for the other two $K\simeq C_5^2$ .) the Frobenius complement $H$ is the Sylow $2$ -subgroup of order $4$ in all three cases, $H$ is core-free in all three cases, the action of the group on $H$ is Frobenius The first three items are easy to verify.

y_H(x)=A\cos(x)+ B\sin(x)\\ A,B\in \Re \\
y_p(x)=A(x)\cos(x)+B(x)\sin(x)

W(F)= \begin{bmatrix}

-\sin(x) & \cos(x)

W(F)^{-1}= \begin{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}

2936597,How can we prove the scaling property of the Dirac delta function rigorously?,"Let $(\Omega,\mathcal A)$ be a measurable space $\omega\in\Omega$ $\delta_\omega$ denote the Dirac measureat $\omega$ on $(\Omega,\mathcal A)$ $E$ be a $\mathbb R$ -Banach space $\mathcal M$ denote the set of strongly $\mathcal A$ -measurable $f:\Omega\to E$ If $f\in\mathcal M$ , $$\langle\delta_\omega,f\rangle :=\int f\:{\rm d}\delta_\omega=f(\omega)$$ is well-defined. In that sense, $\delta_\omega$ can be thought of as an element of the algebraic dual space $\mathcal M^\ast$ of $\mathcal M$ . Now, assume $(\Omega,\mathcal A)=(\mathbb R,\mathcal B(\mathbb R))$ $E=\mathbb R$ In the context of distribution theory, we can find the so-called scaling property of the Dirac delta function $$\langle\delta(a\;\cdot\;),f\rangle=\frac1{\left|a\right|}\left\langle\delta,f\left(\frac{\;\cdot\;}a\right)\right\rangle=\frac1{\left|a\right|}f(0),\tag1$$ where $a\in\mathbb R\setminus\left\{0\right\}$ and $f\in C^\infty(\mathbb R,\mathbb C)$ . My problem is that I don't understand how $\delta(a\;\cdot\;)$ is defined. Moreover, I'm aware of the usual proof of $(1)$ relying on the substitution rule . However, since the Dirac delta function is not a function, I don't understand why that rule is applicable. It seems like one is assuming that there is a function $\delta$ such that the measure $\delta_x$ is Radon-Nikodým differentiable with respect to the Lebesuge measure $\lambda$ on $(\mathbb R,\mathcal B(\mathbb R))$ with $$\delta(\;\cdot\;-x)=\frac{{\rm d}\delta_x}{{\rm d}\lambda}\tag2$$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$ . With that assumption, it's easy to see that $$\int f(y)\delta(a(y-x))\:\lambda({\rm d}y)=\frac1{|a|}\int f\left(\frac{\;\cdot\;}a\right)\delta(\;\cdot\;-ax)\:{\rm d}\lambda=\frac1{|a|}f(x)\tag3$$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$ . However, since $\delta_x$ is singular with respect to $\lambda$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$ , $(2)$ is not well-defined. So, how can we state and prove $(1)$ in a rigorous way?

2937175,"Explain how if $X_i$ are independent, then $(S_n/\sqrt{n})$ will (often) diverge almost surely","Suppose $X_i:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ are independent. Consider a function $f(n)$ which goes to $+\infty$ as $n\to \infty$ , and so $(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)/f(n)$ is a generalized average. My understanding is that if $f(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ , then the event $E_r = \{ \omega \in \Omega \mid (\sum X_n(\omega))/f(n) \to r \in \mathbb{R} \}$ is a tail event, and so its probability is either zero or one. Consequently, if $X_n/f_n \xrightarrow{a.s.} X$ , then $X$ must be almost surely constant. So something like $(\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu_i))/\sigma_i\sqrt{n}$ , which we often find to converge in distribution to some nice distribution $D$ , will usually diverge almost surely. (Unless $D$ itself is like a delta.) Can someone help me understand why it should diverge almost surely, across a wide variety of choices for $X_i$ ? My attempt : Since we are normalizing $Z_i = (X_i - \mu_i)/\sigma_i$ so that it is zero-centered with a prescribed variance, we should think of $\sum_{i=1}^nZ_i/f(n)$ as something like the partial sums of an alternating series. So it is not surprising that the partial sums don't run off to infinity. On the other hand, suppose that $\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i /f(n)$ did converge to some random variable almost surely. What would that random variable $X$ possibly look like? It would be quite difficult to describe as a function of $\omega \in \Omega$ ...our variable $\omega$ would basically have to encode all the information $X_1(\omega), X_2(\omega), \dotsc$ , and so it would be hard to describe the limiting r.v. $X$ in a simpler way. Nevertheless, I don't see why there would usually not exist such a variable $X$ ...that is, why would $\sum_{i=1}^nZ_i/f(n)$ not settle down, in general? I guess it's saying that because $\sum_{i=1}^n|Z_i(\omega)|/f(n)$ does not converge usually, and because it's not a strictly alternating series, there will be subsequences $\left| \sum_{i=k}^{k+N}|Z_i(\omega)|/f(k+N)\right|>\epsilon$ for arbitrarily high $k$ .","['measure-theory', 'central-limit-theorem', 'probability-theory']"

This proves that $\dfrac{S_n}{n}\to 0$ in probability. However, I'm stuck with proving that $\dfrac{S_n}{n}$ does not converge to 0 a.s. I'd like to apply Borel-Cantelli lemma here, but each $S_n$ is not independent, so the fact that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k\log k}=\infty$ cannot tell anything about convergence.

2938322,Spiral path quasi-CDF sampling approach question,"Fairly certain this sampling method is not new, so I wanted to put it out there and see if folks could point me to a paper referencing it.  It's self-constructed, but likely not new. My post here is (a) to get feedback on this idea and (b) find out pre-existing work like this exists and (c) the possibility of space-filling solid spirals in higher dimensions? (d) does this problem statement have useful overlap with the Cantor pairing function? The idea is to take (in 2-D, but extensible to 3+-D?) in a discretized sample space a spiral that goes outward from the origin (a square outward spiral with steps of +x, +y, -x, -x, -y, -y, +x, +x, +x, +y, +y, +y, ...) and with each step you compute the local pdf (arbitrarily complex) and then add each incremental pdf adder to the quasi-CDF (which starts as zero at the origin).  The gist is to take sampling from a 2-D space CDF $F(x,y)$ and map it into a 1-D equivalent $\tilde{F}(s)$ where $F(x,y) \rightarrow \tilde{F}(s)$ sampling yields the same end result. Here's the Excel spreadsheet realization of it: spiral quasi-CDF from pdf in 2D for sampling The for the pdf I used the sum of two 2-D x-y uncorrelated Gaussians ... relatively simple distribution but coding in more complex ones not necessarily difficult.  My apologies for using Excel ... anathema to most folks, likely. Once you spiral sufficiently outward, adding up pdf increments as you go, last step is to normalize by dividing by the final quasi-CDF sum.  Now you have $\tilde{F}\left(s\right)$ which ranges from 0 to 1.  Sampling is then done by drawing from $U\left[0,1\right]$ and looking up the corresponding location on the spiral. Here's an example of a few hundred samples drawn from this quasi-CDF. My post here is to get feedback on this idea and find out pre-existing work like this and the possibility of space-filling solid spirals in higher dimensions? One last image here is a 3-d scatterplot of $\tilde{F}\left(x,t\right)$ ... you have to zoom in to see the kinks which represent the details of the underlying distributions Thanks in advance ...

To make the point, see the two graphics below with a two-dimensional Gaussian centered in positive-enough x- and y-space that we can treat (1,1) as negative infinite.

To show: $$(D \cdot C) = h^0(D \cap C, \mathcal{O}_{C \cap D})$$ My efforts: Since by definition and exercise 20.2.A (a) we already know that $(D \cdot C) = deg(\mathcal{O}_X(D) \vert _C) = \chi(\mathcal{O}_X(D) \vert _C) - \chi(\mathcal{O}_C)$ here $\chi$ is the Euler characteristic and $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ the corresponing invertible sheaf to divisor $D$ . The ideal is to show that following sequence is exact: (*) $$0 \to \mathcal{O}_C(-D) \to \mathcal{O}_C \to \mathcal{O}_{D \cap C} \to 0$$ and then using the additivity of Euler charecteristic and the fact that $\chi(\mathcal{O}_{C \cap D})= h^0(D \cap C, \mathcal{O}_{C \cap D})$ since this intersection is zero dimensional. Since this sequence arrises from the sequence $0 \to \mathcal{O}_X(-D) \to \mathcal{O}_X \to \mathcal{O}_D \to 0$ by tensoring with $\mathcal{O}_C$ the only cruical point is to prove that $\mathcal{O}_C(-D) \to \mathcal{O}_C$ is injective. By definition this can be done on level of stalks. By definition the stalks are given by $\mathcal{O}_{C,c} = \mathcal{O}_{X,c}/(g)$ and $\mathcal{O}(-D)_{X,c} = f\mathcal{O}_{X,c}$ for regular $f, g \in \mathcal{O}_{X,c}$ since $C,D$ effective divisors. Therefore we get $\mathcal{O}_C(-D)_c = \mathcal{O}(-D)_{X,c} \otimes \mathcal{O}_{C,c}= f\mathcal{O}_{X,c} \otimes \mathcal{O}_{X,c}/(g) = f\mathcal{O}_{X,c}/(fg)$ So I have to show that $$f\mathcal{O}_{X,c}/(fg) \to \mathcal{O}_{X,c}/(g)$$ is injective for every $c \in C$ . Since $C$ is a curve two cases could happen: $c$ is generic point (of $C$ ) $c$ is a closed Could anybody help to show the desired injectivity for these two cases?

$$ Taking derivatives, we get $\partial_x \vec{e}_x = \partial_x \vec{e}_y = \partial_y \vec{e}_x = \partial_y \vec{e}_y = \vec{0}$ and we can differentiate polars as follows: \begin{align}
