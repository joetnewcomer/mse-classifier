Using only PNT, it's conceivable that each integer upto $10^{10^{10}}$ is non-prime. However using other methods this is found not to be the case. Is there a theorem analogous to PNT such that each integer is assigned a definite positive probability to satisfy a property $P(n)$, but no integer that satisfy $P(n)$ is known? However if we sum the probabilities, and it sums to $1$, does it prove the existence of such an integer? And also such that there are no other (then probabilistic) methods to prove the existence of an integer that satisfy $P(n)$.

77220,The intuition behind slant asymptotes,"I'm asking this question to get a better understanding of oblique asymptotes. As regards vertical asymptotes, I know that they represent the numbers that make a function undefined.  An example of this is a $0$ in the denominator, or a negative argument to a square root since that would return a complex number. For horizontal asymptotes, I know that if the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator of a rational function, there are no horizontal asymptotes because as x tends to infinity, the result of the function keeps getting larger and larger.  Also, if the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator, there is a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$ because as $x$ gets larger and larger, the value of the denominator greatly exceeds the value of the denominator and thus the value gets closer and closer to $0$ .  And finally, if the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote will be $y = \frac{n}{d}$ where $n$ are the leading coefficients on the numerator and denominator respectively. But for slant asymptotes, my book just says that they will exist only when the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than that of the denominator (and that you need to divide the polynomials to find the equation of the line of the slant asymptote). My question is, why is it that slant asymptotes only occur when the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than that of the denominator?",['algebra-precalculus']
77239,"The norm of $x\in X$, where $X$ is a normed linear space","Question: Let $x\in X$, $X$ is a normed linear space and let $X^{*}$ denote the dual space of $X$. 
  Prove that$$\|x\|=\sup_{\|f\|=1}|f(x)|$$ where $f\in X^{*}$. My proof: Let $0\ne x\in X$, using HBT take $f\in X^{*}$ such that $\|f\|=1$ and $f(x)=\|x\|$. Now, $\|x\|=f(x)\le|f(x)|\le\sup_{\|x\|=1}|f(x)|=\sup_{\|f\|=1}|f(x)|$, this implies $$\|x\|\le\sup_{\|f\|=1}|f(x)|\quad (1)$$ Since $f$ is a bounded linear functional $|f(x)|\le\|f\|\|x\|$ for all $x\in X$. 
Since$\|f\|=1$,  $|f(x)|\le\|x\|$ for all $x\in X$. This implies $$\|x\|\ge\sup_{\|f\|=1}|f(x)|\quad(2)$$ Therefore $(1)$ and $(2)$ gives $\|x\|=\sup_{\|f\|=1}|f(x)|$. If $x=0$, the result seems to be trivial, but I am still trying to convince myself. Still I have doubts about my proof, is it correct? Please help. Edit: Please note that, I use the result of the one of the consequences of Hahn-Banach theorem. That is, given a normed linear space $X$ and $x_{0}\in X$ $x_{0}\ne 0$, there exist $f\in X^{*}$ such that $f(x_{0})=\|f\|\|x_{0}\|$","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

77266,How to get a group from a semigroup,"I am sorry if my question is too simple. Is every semigroup associated to a group? If no, what conditions should be satisfied for a semigroup to have an associated group? If yes, how can I find the group? I thought of the universal property. Let $X$ be a semigroup, define $G$ to be the group with a morphism of semigroups $\tau: X \rightarrow G$, such that if $H$ is any group having similar morphism $\phi: X \rightarrow H$, there is a group homomorphism $\psi: G \rightarrow H$, such that $\phi = \psi \circ \tau$. Uniqueness is obtained from the universal property. But existence needs construction. When there is no element $x$ in $X$ such that for any $a \in X$, $xa = ax = a$, i.e., $X$ doesn't contain an identity element, I define $G = \{ 1 \} \cup \{ x_1^{k_1} \cdots x_n^{k_n} | x_i \in X, k_i \in \{ \pm 1 \}, i = 1, \cdots, n; k_jk_{j+1} = -1, 1 \leq j <n \}$ with equivalence relations: $x^{k}x^{-k} \equiv 1$, $x_1^{k_1} \cdots x_{i-1}^{k_{i-1}}x_i^kx_i^{-k}x_{i+2}^{k_{i+2}} \cdots x_n^{k_n} \equiv x_1^{k_1} \cdots x_{i-1}^{k_{i-1}}x_{i+2}^{k_{i+2}} \cdots x_n^{k_n}$ and group operations Multiplication: 
$\begin{cases}
 1 \cdot x_1^{k_1} \cdots x_n^{k_n} = x_1^{k_1} \cdots x_n^{k_n} \cdot 1 =x_1^{k_1} \cdots x_n^{k_n},   \\ 
 x_1^{k_1} \cdots x_n^{k_n} \cdot y_1^{l_1} \cdots y_m^{l_m}= \begin{cases}
 x_1^{k_1} \cdots x_n^{k_n}y_1^{l_1} \cdots y_m^{l_m} & \text{ if } k_nl_1=-1, \\ 
 x_1^{k_1} \cdots (x_ny_1)^{l_1} \cdots y_m^{l_m}& \text{ if } k_nl_1=1;

\end{cases}$ Inverse: $1^{-1} =1$, $(x_1^{k_1} \cdots x_n^{k_n})^{-1} = x_n^{-k_n} \cdots x_1^{-k_1}$. Then clearly, the morphism $\tau: X \rightarrow G$ can be defined to send every $x \in X$ to $x \in G$. Beside possible leaks, this construction is not precise, and doesn't work in case when $G$ already has an identity, or even is a group. So, when are semigroups associated with a group, and how can I construct a group from a semigroup? Thanks in advance.","['semigroups', 'group-theory']"
77280,Preservation of ideals in localized rings,"Refer to localization of rings in Lang's Algebra p. 108. In particular,
let $A$ be a commutative ring, $S$ a subset of $A$ that is a submonoid of

$S^{-1}A$ is the set of elements $\frac{a}{s}$ with $a \in A$ and $s \in S$. 
We have $\frac{a_1}{s_1}=\frac{a_2}{s_2}$ if there exists $\bar{s} \in S$ such that $\bar{s}(s_2a_1 - s_1 a_2)=0$. Now consider the injection of $A$ into $S^{-1}A$ given by $x \mapsto \frac{x}{1}$. This is a ring homomorphism. Let $J$ be an ideal of $A$. Ring homomorphisms preserve ideals and so the injection of $J$ into $S^{-1}A$, call it $J^{*}$, will be an ideal. My problem is that i don't see why for any $\frac{a}{s} \in S^{-1}A$ and any $\frac{j}{1} \in J^{*}$ we will have that $\frac{aj}{s}$ will be in $J^{*}$, i.e. why there must exist an element $\kappa \in J$ such that $\frac{aj}{s}=\frac{\kappa}{1}$.",['abstract-algebra']

77306,Why does substitution work in antiderivatives?,"I'm not entirely sure what I want to ask here, so please bear with me! I think the explanation they give us in school for how finding the antiderivative by substitution works is: $$\int f(g(t))g'(t)dt=(Fg)(t)=F(g(t))=F(u)=\int f(u)du$$ But I never really understood the equality $F(u)=\int f(u)du$. Why can we behave as if the identity $u=g(t)$ doesn't exist, compute the integral $\int f(u)du$, and then 'substitute' $u$ in the result yielding the correct answer? In a sense, it feels like the variable $u$ switches from being 'meaningful' in $F(u)$ (where it stands for $g(t)$) and being insignificant in $\int f(u)du$, since as I perceive it the ""variable name"" here is meaningless and we could say $ \int f(u)du = \int f(k)dk = \int f(x)dx = ... $ all the same. Another way to ask the same thing: why $(Fg)(t)=\int f(u)du$ and not, say, $(Fg)(t)=\int f(x)dx$? Where am I getting confused? Maybe someone can explain this better than my high school teacher?

77364,Norm of the linear bounded operator $T$ defined by $(Tf)(x) = \int_0^x g(t)f(t)dt$,"Some time ago my teacher showed the solution of this exercise. Today I reviewed it, and I think he might be wrong at the last part, c.) Exercise: Let $a > 0$ and let $g \in C[0,a]$ be a non-negative function. Consider the operator $T: C[0,a] \rightarrow C[0,a]$, defined by $$(Tf)(x) = \int_0^x g(t)f(t)dt\;.$$ a.) Prove that the operator $T$ is linear. Solution : 
$$\begin{align*}
T(f+h) &= \displaystyle \int_0^x g(t)(f+h)(t)dt = \int_0^x g(t)f(t) + g(t)h(t)dt\\
&= \int_0^x g(t)f(t)dt + \int_0^x g(t)h(t)dt = T(f) + T(h)\;;\\
T(\alpha f) &= \displaystyle \int_0^x \alpha \; g(t)f(t)dt = \alpha \int_0^x g(t)f(t)dt = \alpha \; T(f)\;.
\end{align*}$$ b.) Prove that the operator $T$ is continuous. Solution : Show that it is bounded (which implies it is continuous), i.e. some constant $c$ should exist such that $\|Tf\|_\infty \le c\; \|f\|_\infty$: $$\|Tf\|_\infty \le (\text{interval length})\|g\|_\infty\|f\|_\infty = a \; \|g\|_\infty\|f\|_\infty\;;$$ in this case $c = a \; \|g\|_\infty$. c.) Define the norm of the operator $T$. The idea is to show that the inequality from b.) could change to an equality if you pick the right function for $f(t)$. He said, choose $f(t) = \dfrac{\|g\|_\infty}{g(t)}$. That way, $Tf = x\; \|g\|_\infty$; the sup-norm of this is of course $a \; \|g\|_\infty$. Definition of the norm of an operator $T$: $$\|T\| = \sup_{x\in \mathcal{D}(T)} \frac{\|Tf\|_\infty}{\|f\|_\infty}\;.$$ We saw that $\sup \|Tf\|_\infty = a \; \|g\|_\infty$, so $\|f\|_\infty$ should be $1$, right? But this isn't the case: $$\|f\|_\infty = \left\| \dfrac{\|g\|_\infty}{g(t)} \right\|_\infty \neq 1\;.$$ However, $g(t) / \|g\|$ would be. So, what's going wrong here? The sup-norm of a function in $C[a,b]$ is just the maximum value of that function on the given interval, right. I'm not entirely sure about the definition of $\|T\|$; the sup-part seems redundant? [Edit] I just added a comment, since $\|f(t)g(t)\|_\infty = \|g(t)\|_\infty$ this would result in the expected value for the norm. However, in order to calculate the norm of $T$ you should to be able to divide $\|Tf\|$ by $\|f\|$. However, since $\|f\|$ can go to infinity, I don't see how I should this. 
And once more, I don't understand why there should be a $\sup$ condition for the $\|T\|$ since it is already a quotient of norms, so the $\sup$ condition could be left out in my opinion?","['normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
77366,About the isomorphism $\operatorname{Br}(\mathbb{Q}_p)\cong \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$,"I've been reading the section about Brauer groups in Introduction to Modern Number Theory, and I couldn't quite understand how this isomorphism is defined. We start with a central simple algebra $A$, over $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Then, the book says, we take ``a maximal unramified extension'' $L$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ in  $A$. The book informs me that there are several of those, and that they are all conjugate in $A$. Then the book says the the valuation on $\mathbb{Q}_p$ extends to a valuation $v_A$ on $A$, and that the Frobenius automorphism of $L$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ extends to an inner automorphism of $A$ by some element $\gamma \in A$. Thus $v_A:A^{\times}\rightarrow \frac{1}{n}\mathbb{Z}$, and we define the map that is designed to be an isomorphism from $Br(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ to $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ by $A\mapsto v_A(\gamma)$. The book informs me that this is well defined and in fact an isomophism. But I'm not sure I understand what $L$ being a ``maximal unramified extension'' means. Is it: let $L$ be a field extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, contained in $A$, and unramified over $K$? I can't think of any examples where $L$ wouldn't be $K$ itself, since the center of $A$ is $\mathbb{Q}_p$?

77413,Limits of Monotone Functions,"I've been studying about limits of functions using Introduction to Analysis by Gaughan.  A few days ago I asked this question Limits of Functions about the limits of functions. The motivation was curiosity about whether the idea of proving that a function has a limit at a given point could be generalized to proving that a given function had limits at all points in it's domain.  After reading the next section of the book, Limits of Monotone Functions , I have another question along the same lines. In that section the author gives the following theorem and support lemma: Lemma: Let $f : [\alpha, \beta] \to \mathbb R$ be increasing. Let $U(x) = \inf\{f(y) : x < y\}$ and $L(x) = \sup\{f(y) : y  < x\}$ for $x \in (\alpha, \beta)$ . Then $f$ has a limit at $x_0\in (\alpha,\beta)$ iff $U(x_0) = L(x_0)$ , and in this case $\lim f(x) = f(x_0) = U(x_0) = L(x_0)$ . Theorem: Let $f : [\alpha, \beta]\to \mathbb R$ be monotone. Then $$D = \{x : x \in (\alpha, \beta)\text{ and }f\text{ does not have a limit at }x\}$$ is countable. If $f$ has a limit at $x_0 \in (\alpha,\beta)$ then $\lim f(x) = f(x_0)$ . The author goes on to say the idea is that a monotone function will have a limit everywhere except possibly at a countable set of points.  My question is: if you restrict the domain of a function, as he did in the text, can this be applied to functions that aren't strictly monotone?  As an example, $x^2$ is monotone on $[0, \infty)$ . Based on my understanding, you could use this to show that a limit exists for all points in say $[1,3]$ .  While not exactly what I was looking for in my first post, this would go a long way towards that end.",['real-analysis']

Let $(t_0=0, t_1,…,t_k=1)$ be a partition of $[0,1]$ so that $\gamma$ sends $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$ into an open set U with the property that any two points in U can be connected by a distance minimizing geodesic which depends smoothly on the two endpoints.  If $\tau$ is between $t_j$ and $t_{j+1}$ then the space of ""broken"" Jacobi fields along $\gamma|_{[0,\tau]}$ (i.e. those piecewise smooth $V$ which are Jacobi fields along each piece of the partition of $[0, \tau]$) which vanish at $t=0$ and $t=\tau$ is isomorphic as a real vector space to the direct sum $T_{\gamma (t_1)}M\oplus...\oplus T_{\gamma (t_j)}M$ .  Call this latter sum $\Sigma$.  Then the Hessian of the energy function associated with $\gamma|_{[0,\tau]}$ (call it $E_\tau$) can be viewed as a bilinear form on $\Sigma$. My question: I want to know why this bilinear form should vary continuously with $(\tau, V, W) \in (t_j,t_{j+1})\times \Sigma \times \Sigma$.  I.e. if $V_\tau$ and $W_\tau$ are the broken Jacobi fields along $\gamma|_{[0,\tau]}$ associated with $V, W\in \Sigma$, why is $(t_j,t_{j+1})\times \Sigma \times \Sigma \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, (\tau, V, W)  \mapsto E_\tau (V_\tau , W_\tau )$ continuous?

77463,Calculating RGB plus Amber,"I'm currently working on a wide gamut light source using red, green and blue LED emitters. From an internal xyY (or CIE XYZ) representation, I can reach any color or color temperature via a 3x3 transformation matrix. The matrix is calculated from the chromaticity coordinates and the relative luminance of the actual RGB emitters. This works well both in theory and in practice. However, the RGB LEDs emitts a discontinuous spectrum with very little energy between red and green. I want to add an orange or amber LED to improve the spectrum and the color rendering index.
Starting from CIE xyY, how do I calculate RGB plus Amber? The entire CIE model is based on tristimulus and I can't see how I can use it to calculate a fourth color. The ideal would probably be a model that could accept any number of colors. ADDED based on discussion: Above is an illustration of how I imagine the RGB math works. I measure the chromaticity coordinates (x,y) of each of the Red, Green and Blue emitters, and their relative brightness (Y). From xyY I calculate CIE XYZ. This is needed because xy plus Y is a projection, XYZ is the actual 3-dimensional color space. I put the XYZ values for the three emitters into a matrix and calculate the inverse of that matrix. This inverse matrix represents the difference between the ""actual"" (human vision) and the properties of these particular emitters.
If I want to display a particular color, say the white shown above to the right, I can take the desired coordinates, send them through the matrix, and get the required strength for each emitter (shown as arrows). Now RGBA: Originally I thought that the math for one more emitter (RGBA) was similar to the math for RGB. That I could use a 3*4 matrix to calculate RGBA, the same way I use a 3*3 matrix to calculate RGB. However, it seems like there are problems calculating the inverse of a non-square matrix. Some sources say it can not be done, some say if can be done, but the resulting matrix be lacking in some respect. This is WAY beyond my understanding! :-) @percusse suggests that a 3*4 matrix can be used. If so, how can I calculate the inverse matrix (I'm on a shoestring budget, software like MATLAB is out of reach). Second EDIT: Based on the input from @joriki and @percusse I've tried to solve this on paper. I've spent a lot of paper, but I can't seem to find a way to do this that can be implemented as computer code, - or even produces the right answer! I'm probably making mistakes in the practical solving, but that is not actually critical. Computing will have to be done by a C implementation of a solving algorithm (gaussian elimination?) that is known to be good. This would be typ XYZ values for the four emitters calculated form measured xyY coordinates (actual values will have better precision): $$

$$ I've been thinking about optimization and there are a number of parameters that affects the optimal mix, mainly spectrum, efficacy, and heat. For a small system, it is probably enough to worry about the extremes of the amber emitter (avoid max amber when emitting orange-ish light, avoid min amber when emitting any other color). A solution is already suggested by @joriki [""This selects the solution that covers the spectrum most evenly""] but I don't understand the math :-) So I need to get this system of equations into a form that generates a single answer within 500us of computing time on a small embedded processor :-) Any guidance on how to get a step closer a practical implementation would be greatly appreciated! Third EDIT:
I've set up a test that can drive 4 emitters, and a spectrometer to measure the output. The relative intensities of the emitters are tweaked to give a correlated color temperature of roughly 6000 Kelvin (midday daylight). RGB at ca. 6000K: RGB + Amber at ca. 6000K: RGB + White at ca. 6000K: The first image shows the spectrum from 3 emitters, Red, Green and Blue. There is very little light between 560 and 610 nm. 
The next image shows the spectrum when Amber is added to RGB. Amber improves the situation significantly. (Yellow might be better, but suitable high brightness yellow LEDs can't be found).
The last image shows the spectrum when White is added to RGB. White LEDs are actually phosphor converted blue. The phosphor can be made to retransmitt over a fairly broad spectrum. This seems to give the best result in terms of even spectrum. I think I have working code for Gaussian Elimination. The question now is how do I add mean square minimization to the equations in such a way that I end up with a single answer? I probably need some hints on how to solve this in practice. Sorry! :-) Fourth and fifth EDIT: So I have measured the spectra from 380 to 780nm with 1nm resolution. The output is measured at equal input value. I calculated the area under the curve by trigonometry. I calculated the average size for the 400 trapeziods between 380 and 780nm for R, G, B and A (values are scaled to me more manageable): $\langle R\rangle = 19.8719507$ $\langle G\rangle = 13.39000051$ $\langle B\rangle = 29.30636046$ $\langle A\rangle = 8.165754589$ And also the average for the product of all six (plus four) combinations of emitter pairs.
I then took a stab at assembling this into a covariance matrix: $$

With a set of measured RGBA emitter color coordinates and an ZYX value (the color we want the emitters to generate) as input we calculate two values for each emitter. The values are $R = u_{RED} + Av_{RED}$ $G = u_{GREEN} + Av_{GREEN}$ $B = u_{BLUE} + Av_{BLUE}$ $A = A$ The calculation involves gaussian elimination and substitution, and I have written code that performs those calculations. The value of A should preferably be the one that, together with RGB, produces the most even spectrum. This appears to be the calculation of A: $$
\begin{eqnarray}
A
&=&
-\frac{\sum_{\alpha,\beta}M_{\alpha\beta}x_\alpha y_\beta}{\sum_{\alpha,\beta}M_{\alpha\beta}y_\alpha y_\beta}
\;.
\end{eqnarray}
$$ One element of this equation is $M_{\alpha\beta}$ which is a 4 * 4 covariance matrix that we have precalculated from the emitter spectra. This is as far as I am right now. I don't understand from the above notation how the math works. Do I run every possible combination of emitter colors through the matrix add them all up? I have to admit I am completely lost! :-)",['matrices']

Question I have been taught that Fubini's Theorem holds if the region of integration is bounded, but all the books in Statistical Inference I own and my teachers always evaluate such multiple improper integrals (expectations, densities, and so forth) as iterated single improper integrals, and most of the times those are Gamma, Beta or density functions. I recall from multivariable calculus that if a function $f(x,y)$ is positive and $D = [a,\infty)\times[b,\infty)$ then, if the limit exists: $$\int_D f = \lim_{(c,d) \to (\infty,\infty)}\int_b^d\int_a^c f(x,y) \, dx \, dy = \lim_{(c,d) \to (\infty,\infty)}\int_a^c\int_b^d f(x,y) \, dy \, dx $$ Which I think it is not quite ""the product"" of two single improper integrals, so there must be something I am missing. Whenever I have applied this theorem in the context of multivariable calculus (homework, exams) $f$ was always a carefully chosen function with anti-derivatives.

p(\lambda, \theta \, | \, \mathbf{x}) \propto p(\theta,\lambda) f(\mathbf{x} \, | \, \lambda, \theta)

Consider the model of the projective plane given by the last diagram on page 37 of these notes (it's just a lens-shape in the plane, with opposite sides identified in a ""chasing"" way): Now if you remove an open disk from it, what's left, call it $M$, is homeomorphic to a Möbius strip. Unlike the projective plane, the Möbius strip can be embedded in ${\bf R}^3$ with no self-intersections. So it's natural to ask whether you can use the model $M$ to construct a physical Möbius strip. That is, does the presence of the hole make it possible to carry out in 3-space the indicated identification of edges, without tearing or self-intersection, provided the material being used is sufficiently elastic. Experiments with paper have not been encouraging. Is there some obstruction to making a Möbius strip from $M$? Another plane model for a Möbius strip is a triangle with 2 edges identified ""chasing"" and one edge unidentified. The 2nd figure on page 40 of those notes will do as an illustration. Again, I haven't been able to carry out the identification with paper in 3-space; is it possible? or is there some obstruction? I should add that of course I know that one can make a Möbius strip from the usual model, a rectangle with one pair of opposite edges identified chasing.

If the conditional probability is regular, i.e. $\forall \omega \in \Omega, P(\cdot \mid \mathcal{N})(\omega)$ is a probability measure on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$, define $Y: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ for any random variable $X$ as
$$
Y(\omega):=\int_\Omega X \, dP(\cdot \mid \mathcal{N})(\omega).
$$
Is $Y$ a version of the conditional expectation $E(X \mid \mathcal{N})$, i.e. 
$$
Y = E(X \mid \mathcal{N}) \text{ a.e. }?
$$ Thanks and regards!",['probability-theory']
