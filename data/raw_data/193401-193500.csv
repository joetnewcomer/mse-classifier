3703595,"However, how long will it take to randomly generate an $n$-universal word?","Suppose $A$ is a finite alphabet, $|A| = m$ . Let's call a word $w \in A^*$ $n$ -universal iff it contains every word from $A^n$ as a subword. Now, suppose we generate a random $n$ -universal word in a following way: we start with the empty word and each step add to the right of it a symbol that we generate independently under uniform distribution. That lasts until we our word becomes $n$ -universal (in the long run we will almost surely get it due to the infinite monkey theorem). However, how long will it take? Let's denote the expected length of the word generated that way/expected number of turns to generate it as $Eu(n, m)$ . I would like to know the value of $Eu(n, m)$ (or at least its asymptotic for large $n$ and $m$ ). For $m = 1$ : as there is only one word of length $n$ , thus we are guaranteed to get it at $n$ -th turn. Thus $Eu(n, 1) = n$ . For $n = 1$ ,  we will generate an arbitrary symbol, then wait till a symbol that was not generated before is generated. Repeat this until the set of symbols is exhausted. Thus $Eu(1, m) = m(\sum_{i = 1}^{m} \frac{1}{i}) = m(ln(m) + \gamma) + O(1)$ For $n = m = 2$ , we first generate two symbols. If they are the same, we will wait till the other symbol is generated and then wait what comes after it. If it is the same then we only have to  wait till the initial symbol appears again.  Otherwise, we need to wait till that other symbol appears again twice in a row. If two initial symbols are different, we will generate an additional one. If it the same as the previous one, we will wait till two first symbols come it a row. Otherwise we will wait till two second symbols come in a row. Thus $Eu(2, 2) = 2 + \frac{1}{2}(2 + \frac{1}{2}6 + \frac{1}{2}2) + \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2} + 6) = \frac{33}{4}$ However, I do not know how to calculate it for different $(n, m)$ .","['combinatorics-on-words', 'stochastic-processes', 'coupon-collector', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"

Then, one and only one holds true: $x \ge y$ or $x \le y$ If $x \ge y$ , $x=x+(y-y)=(x-y)+y=|x-y|+y$ Also, $$x=\frac {x+x}{2}=\frac{|x-y|+y+x}{2}=\frac{|x-y|+x+y}{2}$$ If $y \ge x$ , $y=y+(x-x)=(y-x)+y=|y-x|+y$ Also, $$y=\frac {y+y}{2}=\frac{|y-x|+x+y}{2}=\frac{|x-y|+x+y}{2}$$ Thus, $$\max(x,y)=\frac{x+y+|y-x|}{2}$$ How can I improve this proof?

Prove that there is a unique real number $c$ such that there is a unique real number $x$ such that $x^2 + 3x + c = 0$ . Proof: Let $c = \frac{9}{4}$ .  Let $x = -\frac{3}{2}$ . It follows that $x^2 + 3x + c = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{9}{2} + \frac{9}{4} = 0$ . To show that $x$ is unique, let $y \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary such that $y^2 + 3y + c = 0$ .

3704106,Distance between points maximally distributed on n-dimensional unit sphere?,"This problem arose in some of my own personal data science research and I am wondering if anyone has encountered this before. Consider $k$ points that lie on an $n$ -dimensional unit sphere such that all pairs of points are as far apart as possible. Is there a closed-form solution to finding this distance? First I tried solving it in a simpler case of a 2-dimensional sphere, i.e a circle. In this case, the problem reduces to finding the length of one side of a regular polygon inscribed in a unit circle. Using some simple trigonometry we can derive a formula for the length of one side of this polygon: $$d = 2 \sin \frac{\pi}{k}$$ where $d$ is the distance between any pair of points and $k$ is the number of points. So in 2-dimensions, this is the furthest distance between any two points on a unit circle such that all pairs of points are the same distance apart. It seems that one could similarly solve this in 3-dimensions by inscribing solids inside the sphere and finding their side lengths, though I am unsure of how to approach this, let alone $n$ -dimensions. Is it possible to find a general solution to this problem when we have $k$ points lying on an $n$ -dimensional unit sphere? Thank you to anyone who can offer insights or help! Please let me know if anything needs further clarification.","['euclidean-geometry', 'spheres', 'geometry']"

3704308,Is this derivation I did for the expansion of $\cos (\alpha+\beta)$ correct and how can I get rid of the $\pm$ symbol in it?,"I derived the expansion of $\cos (\alpha + \beta)$ as follows, please take a look : Here, $\angle AOB = \alpha$ , $\angle BOC = \beta$ , $\angle AOC = (\alpha + \beta)$ , $a = \cos \alpha$ , $b = \sin \alpha$ , $m = \cos \beta$ , $n = \sin \beta$ , $x = \cos (\alpha + \beta)$ and $y = \sin (\alpha + \beta)$ . Something to be noticed : $a^2 + b^2 = m^2 + n^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 1$ as they all are sines and cosines of $\alpha$ , $\beta$ and $(\alpha + \beta)$ respectively. These equations will be used  further in the derivation. Now, from the above diagram,  we can find the length of chord $BC$ using the distance formula which states that the distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on the Cartesian Plane is : $\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}$ . So, we get : $$BC = \sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2} = \sqrt{x^2+a^2-2ax+y^2+b^2-2by} $$ $$ = \sqrt{(a^2+b^2)+(x^2+y^2)-2ax-2by} = \sqrt{2-2ax-2by}$$ Now, what I do is rotate the axes by an angle of $\alpha$ anticlockwise to obtain this : [The dotted lines represent the old axes whereas the red lines denote the new axes. The new X-Axis coincides with the line segment $OB$ ]. Now, the length of chord $BC$ will remain the same irrespective of the position of the coordinate axes. And, the point that was previously $B(a,b)$ is now $(0,1)$ and the point that was previously $C(x,y)$ is now $(m,n)$ because $\beta$ becomes an angle in standard position, so the point where the terminal side of $\beta$ will intersect with the unit circle will be $(\cos \beta, \sin \beta)$ , which as I mentioned earlier, can be written as $(m,n)$ because $m = cos \beta$ and $n = \sin \beta$ . So, in this ""new axes plane"", the length of what previously used to be $BC$ will now be : $$\sqrt{(m-1)^2+(n-0)^2} = \sqrt{m^2+1-2m+n^2} = \sqrt{(m^2+n^2)+1-2m} = \sqrt{2-2m}$$ Now, from the two values of the length of $BC$ that we have obtained by aligning the coordinate axes at two different positions are : $\sqrt{2-2ax-2by}$ and $\sqrt{2-2m}$ . We can equate these two values to arrive at the value of $x$ , which will give us the value of $\cos (\alpha + \beta)$ . $$\sqrt{2-2ax-2by} = \sqrt{2-2m}$$ .
By squaring both sides, we obtain : $$2-2ax-2by = 2-2m$$ Now, we can cancel the term $2$ on both the sides to obtain this : $$-2ax-2by = -2m$$ Dividing both sides by $(-2)$ , we will obtain : $$ax+by=m$$ $$ax+b\sqrt{1-x^2}=m$$ $$b\sqrt{1-x^2} = m-ax$$ By squaring both the sides, we will obtain : $$b^2(1-x^2) = (m-ax)^2 = m^2+a^2x^2-2max$$ $$\therefore b^2-b^2x^2 = m^2+a^2x^2-2max$$ Now, we can convert this equation to the standard quadratic equation form $(Ax^2+Bx+C)$ and obtain this : $$(a^2+b^2)x^2+(-2ma)x+(m^2-b^2)=0$$ Here, $A = a^2+b^2$ which is equal to $1$ , $B = -2ma$ and $C = m^2-b^2$ Let $D$ denote the discriminant. $$\therefore D = B^2-4AC = B^2-4C = 4m^2a^2 - 4(m^2-b^2) = 4m^2a^2 - 4m^2 + 4b^2$$ $$\therefore D = 4(m^2a^2-m^2+b^2) = 4(m^2a^2-m^2+1-a^2) $$ $$ = 4(a^2(m^2-1)-1(m^2-a^2)) = 4(m^2-1)(a^2-1)$$ $$\therefore D = 4(-n^2)(-b^2) = 4n^2b^2 $$ $$ \implies \sqrt{D} = 2nb$$ .
Now, by applying the quadratic formula, $$x = \dfrac{-B \pm \sqrt{D}}{2A} = \dfrac{2ma \pm 2nb}{2} = ma \pm nb$$ From this, we get our final result, $$\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta \pm \sin \alpha \sin \beta$$ Now, the only problem seems to be the $\pm$ symbol. How do I get rid of that and determine which symbol to actually put in its place? Also, please let me know about your thoughts on the derivation. Thanks!",['trigonometry']
3704334,Haar integral invariance against inversion,"Suppose $G$ is a compact Lie group, and $\omega$ is a left-invariant volume form over $G$ such that. $$\int_{G}\omega = 1$$ with respect to the orientation determined by $\omega$ . If I define $$\int_{G}f(g)dg:=\int_{G}f\omega$$ for every continuous real-valued function $f\colon G\to \mathbb{R}$ , the map $f\mapsto\int_{G}f(g)dg$ is called the Haar integral. I need to prove that $$\int_{G}f(g^{-1})dg=\int_{G}f(g)dg$$ for any continuous function $f$ . I have made some attempts without success. First, I tried to use the modular function $c\colon G\to \mathbb{R}$ given by $R_{g}^{*}\omega = c(g)\omega$ for every $g\in G$ . I've seen that, calling the inversion map $\beta$ , we have $$L_{g}^{*}\beta^{*}(\omega)=(\beta \circ L_{g})^{*}\omega=(R_{g^{-1}} \circ \beta)^{*}\omega=\beta^{*}(c(g^{-1})\omega)=c(g^{-1})\beta^{*}\omega$$ so $\beta^{*}\omega$ might not be necessarily left invariant (for example. if $G$ is not connected). With a similar argument, I managed to prove that $\beta^{*}\omega$ is right invariant (but didn't see how to use that to my advantage). Another idea I had was to use the fact that the Haar integral is left and right invariant (which I was able to prove beforehand). Again, I don't see a clear way to get from that to the desired equality. Are any of my ideas on the right track? The book I'm reading on the subject (''Compact Lie groups"", by M. R. Sepanski) says that the argument used to prove the equation is similar to that of proving $$\int_{G}f(gh)dg=\int_{G}f(g)dg$$ for any $h\in G$ . EDIT: I've seen written that this result can be used by proving uniqueness of the integral, i.e., that if the Haar integral can be determined by the properties I already proved, and the functional $$J(f)=\int_{G}f(g^{-1})dg$$ verifies those properties, then $J$ is the Haar integral.

From now on, suppose for concreteness that $X_0$ is a curve. Let $F=\text{id} \times \phi:X \times X \rightarrow X \times X$ . Then $F$ is finite of degree $p$ . For $k \geq 1$ , let $\Gamma \subset X \times X$ be the graph of the morphism $F$ . Let $\Delta$ be the diagonal subvariety inside $X \times X$ . We have isomorphisms $$F^*, F_*:H^2(X \times X) \rightarrow H^2(X \times X)$$ which satisfy $F_* \circ F^* =p\text{Id}$ . Some equalities inside $H^2(X \times X)$ : $F_*([\Delta])=[\Gamma]$ , because $F$ restricts to an isomorphism $\Delta \xrightarrow{\sim} \Gamma$ . $F^*([\Gamma])=p[\Delta]$ .

We have that $[\Gamma] \cdot [\Gamma]=\sum_i (-1)^i\text{Tr}((\phi \circ \phi)^*|H^i(X,\mathbb{Q}_l))$ (see reference in comments), and by a similar formula, $[\Delta] \cdot [\Delta]=\chi(X)$ (euler characteristic). Using the formulas above and the projection formula, we calculate that $\chi(X)=F_*([\Delta] \cdot [\Delta]) = F_*(\frac{1}{p}[\Delta] \cdot F^*([\Gamma]) = \frac{1}{p}F_*([\Delta]) \cdot [\Gamma] = \frac{1}{p} [\Gamma] \cdot [\Gamma]$ , So $\sum_i (-1)^i\text{Tr}((\phi \circ \phi)^*|H^i(X,\mathbb{Q}_l))=[\Gamma] \cdot [\Gamma]=p\chi(X)$ which is not true: the left side is the cardinality of $X_0(\mathbb{F}_{p^2})$ and certainly does not only depend on $\chi(X)$ .","['algebraic-geometry', 'intersection-theory', 'arithmetic-geometry']"

3704543,Upper bound on condition number of row-normalized matrices,"I would like to study the condition number of a non-square normalized matrices as function of the original non row-normalized matrix. Let $X \in \mathbb{R}^{a \times b}$ (for $a > b$ ). We obtain $\hat X$ by taking all the rows of $X$ and normalizing them such that the $\ell_2$ norms of each row is $1$ . We can further assume that all the rows of $X$ are $1 \leq \|x_i| \leq \alpha$ Question I believe (and I would like to prove) that: $$\kappa(\hat X) \leq \kappa(X).$$ For me, the condition number of a matrix $X$ is defined as the ratio between the biggest and the smallest singular value of $X$ , i.e.: $$ \kappa(X) = \frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_k} $$ where $k$ is the rank of the matrix (which can be smaller than $b$ ) I think a property of matrix norm might come handy: its submultiplicativity: $$ \|AB\| \leq \|A\|\|B\|$$ from which it possible to derive the property that $$ \kappa(AB) \leq \kappa(A)\kappa(B)$$ (this is true only in some casis, see referenced questions at the bottom) We recall that the norm of a matrix can be defined from a ( $\ell_p$ which in our case is $\ell_2$ ) $$ \| A \| = \max_{x \neq 0, } \frac{\|Ax\|}{\|x\|}  = \max_{\|x\|=1} \|Ax\| = \sigma_1$$ My attempt: In general, it is easy to see that $\sigma_1(\hat X) < \sigma_1(X)$ , while I cannot prove that $\sigma_{min}(\hat X) > \sigma_{min}(S)$ for the smallest singular values. This is how I approached the proof:
Let me recall you that the condition number, which usually for square matrices is defined as $\kappa(X) = \|X\| \|X^{-1}\|$ for the case of non-square matrices can be better defined as the ratio between the biggest and the smallest singular value. In other words: $\kappa(X)= \|X\|\|X^+\|$ (where $X^+$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of $X$ , i.e. the matrix obtained by taking the inverse $1/\sigma_i$ of the singular values of $\sigma_i$ of $X$ ). We can think of $X$ as the product of $\hat X$ where I left multiply by $N_X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ , a diagonal matrix where the entry in position $ii$ is just $\|x_i\|$ , i.e. the norm of row $i$ . $$ X = N_X \hat X.$$ I thought that I can express the condition number as product of the norm. Unfortunately, this direction seems to lead me astray, as the inequality is in the wrong direction. So: $\kappa(X) = \|N_X\hat  X\| \|(N_X \hat X)^{+}\|=\|N_X\hat  X\| \|\hat  X^{+}N_X^{+} \| \leq \|N_X\| \|\hat  X\| \|\hat  X^{+}\|\|N_X^{+} \| $ and also $\kappa(\hat X) = \|\hat X\| \|\hat X^{-1}\|$ . Also note that $\kappa(N_X) = \kappa(N_X^{-1}) \leq \alpha$ , because of our assumption on the value of the norms of the rows of $X$ . This is equivalent of asking if these two conditions are satisfied: $\|\hat X\| \|\hat X^{+}\| \leq \|N_X\hat  X\| \|(N_X \hat X)^{+}\| $ $\| \hat X^+ \| \leq \|(N\hat X)^+ \| $ It is simple to observe that: $\|\hat X\| \leq \|N\hat X\|$ . This is because, by using the definition of norm of a matrix, $$\forall y \text{ s.t. } \|y\|=1 \text{ we have that } \|\hat Xy\| \leq  \|N \hat Xy\|$$ because each element on the diagonal is bigger than 1. We need to see if $\|\hat X^{+}\| \leq \|(N\hat X)^+\| = \|(\hat X^{+}N^{+})\|$ I am looking here for some monotonicty properties of matrix norms, or property that can be derived from the inverse of a matrix. Am I going in the right direction? Thanks. Reply to comment What if we start from $N^{-1}_XX = \hat X$ ? Then, I would obtain $\kappa(\hat X) = \kappa(N^{-1}_X X) \leq \kappa(N^{-1}_X)\kappa(X) \leq \alpha \kappa(X) $ This does not seems helpful, because we get to the point where $$\kappa(\hat X) \leq \alpha \kappa(X)$$ and, from the previous observation, $$ \kappa(X) \leq \alpha \kappa(\hat X) $$ Experiments I checked that this property is satisfied in two cases: if we have a diagonal matrix $X$ with some random scalar in it, then the normalized version is just the identity matrix, whose condition number is 1. for random matrices (random in sense of numpy.random.rand() ) it holds true that $\kappa(\hat X) \leq \kappa(X)$ Related questions There are numerous questions around the condition number of product of matrices: Condition number of a product of two matrices Counter example or proof that $\kappa(AB) \leq \kappa(A)\kappa(B) $ In the last question they show a counterexample for $\kappa(AB)\leq\kappa(A)\kappa(B) $ which apparently does not hold for non-square matrices.","['matrices', 'condition-number', 'linear-algebra']"

Question: Is there a simple test that can be applied to the pairs (5, 6), (3, 5) and (6, 5), (3, 5) (and knowing m, n) that will indicate immediately that one is based on a superlattice of much smaller period but the other represents the shortest distance in a much more sparse coincident lattice? This answer and this comment below it provide some related tests and might adapted here, but ideally I'm looking for a yes/no test that does not involving testing all points closer. plotting script: https://pastebin.com/6mwvudt6","['linear-algebra', 'geometry']"
3705549,Show that complex measures form a Banach space - An application of Fubini-Tonelli,"The following if Exercise 5.8 in Folland's Real Analysis , 2nd edition: Let $(X, \mathcal M)$ be a measurable space and let $M(X)$ be the space of complex measures on $(X, \mathcal M)$ . Then $||\mu|| = |\mu|(X)$ is a norm on $M(X)$ that makes it into a Banach space. This question already has an answer here , but I would like help to understand a particular proof by Jonathan Conder I found on the internet, which seems more elegant then those presented in the link above. The proof of completenes goes as follows: If $\sum_1^\infty \nu_n$ is an absolutely convergent series in $M(X)$ and $A \in \mathcal M$ , then $\sum_1^\infty \nu_n(A)$ also converges absolutely because $|\nu_n(A)| \leq |\nu_n|(A) \leq |\nu_n|(X)$ for all $n \in \Bbb{N}$ . Hence we may define $\nu: \mathcal M \longrightarrow \Bbb{C}$ by $\nu(A) = \sum_1^\infty \nu_n(A)$ . Clearly $\nu(\emptyset) = 0$ . If $(A_k)$ is a sequence of disjoint sets in $\mathcal M$ whose union in $A$ , then $$
\sum_{k = 1}^\infty |\nu(A_k)| \leq \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{n = 1}^\infty |\nu_n(A_k)| = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty |\nu_n(A_k)| \leq \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty |\nu_n|(A_k) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty |\nu_n|(A) \leq \sum_{n = 1}^\infty ||\nu_n|| < \infty, \quad \quad (1)
$$ by Tonelli's theorem, and Fubini's theorem implies that $$
\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \nu(A_k) = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \nu_n(A_k) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \nu_n(A_k) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \nu_n(A) = \nu(A). \quad \quad (2)
$$ In other words, $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \nu(A_k)$ converges absolutely to $\nu(A)$ , so $\nu \in M(X)$ . Then the author proceeds to show that $\sum_{n = 1} \nu_n$ converges to $\nu$ in $M(X)$ , but my question regards the above (I can provide the full file if requested). Which version of the Fubini and Tonelli theorems is the author using? Is it considering the sums as integrals with the counting measure? I would appreciate if somebody could explain the second passage (the first equality) in (1). Any help will be the most appreciated.

This time, a double limit of an integral. Problem Compute $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} \int_0^R \sin{(x/n)} \sin{(e^x)}dx$ . Hint: Integrate by parts. My issue is the order of the limits.  I can't get a nice closed form solution that does not blow up to infinity in the first limit.  I've performed integration by parts in order to try to find something that is more easily approximated or to see if the integral ""repeats itself"", so to say.  What I've tried doesn't seem to go anywhere. My Attempt Define $f_n(x) = \sin(x/n) \sin (e^x)$ .  For any fixed $x \in \mathbb{R}$ we have that $f_n(x) \rightarrow 0$ .  Additionally, $|f_n(x)| \leq 1$ for all $n$ and $x$ .  So we have that $f_n$ is bounded, measurable, and converges pointwise to $0$ on $\mathbb{R}$ .  At this point, I'd love to conclude that the integral is zero from  the Bounded Convergence Theorem and that $\mathbb{R} = \cup_{m \in \mathbb{N}}[m-1,m]$ .  On every interval as such we have $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_{[m-1,m]}f_n = 0$ by the BCT.  However, the conclusion seems like taking the limits in reverse order.  Is it the case that $\sum_{m \in \mathbb{N}} \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_{[m-1,m]}f_n = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{m \in \mathbb{N}}  \int_{[m-1,m]}f_n $ ? Otherwise I think a solution might be found from the integral over the ascending union $\cup_{n \rightarrow \infty} [0,n]$ .

Let $\ell,m$ be positive integers, and consider the set $[\ell]=\{1,2,\dots,\ell\}$ . We say that $[\ell]$ is of type $P(m,1)$ if for any partition of $[\ell]$ into $m$ non-empty disjoint subsets $S_1,\dots,S_m$ , there exists an $i\leq m$ such that one can choose, possibly with repetition, some elements in $S_i$ to form a good sequence. Otherwise $[\ell]$ is of type $P(m,0)$ . Let $f(m)$ denote the smallest positive integer of type $P(m,1)$ . My question is, what is $f(3)$ ? I managed to prove that $\bullet$ if $\ell$ is of type $P(m,0)$ , then so are $1,2,\dots,\ell-1$ $\bullet$ if $\ell$ is of type $P(m,1)$ , then so are $\ell+1,\ell+2,\dots$ $\bullet$ $f(1)=2$ $\bullet$ $f(2)=5$ Indeed, note that $[4]=\{1,4\}\cup \{2,3\}$ . So $4$ is of type $P(2,0)$ , and therefore so are $1,2,3$ . Now assume that some $n\geq 5$ is of type $P(2,0)$ and that $[n]=S_1\cup S_2$ , where $S_1,S_2$ are non-empty disjoint subsets of $[n]$ . WLOG, $1\in S_1,2\in S_2$ . (Note that if $1,2$ are in the same $S_i$ , then there would be a good sequence $1,1,2$ .) Let $r$ be the largest element in $S_1$ . If $r=1$ , then $2,4\in S_2$ but $2,2,4$ is a good sequence. So $r>1$ . If $r<n$ , then $r+1\leq n$ and $r+1\in S_2$ . Thus, $r-1=(r+1)-2\not\in S_2$ , meaning that $r-1\in S_1$ . Now $1,r-1,r$ is a good sequence in $S_1$ , a contradiction. Therefore, $r=n$ . But then $n-1=r-1\not\in S_1$ . So $n-1\in S_2$ , and $n-3=(n-1)-2\in S_1$ . Finally, $3=n-(n-3)\in S_2$ , and $5=2+3\in S_1$ . Then $4=5-1\in S_2$ , creating a good sequence $2,2,4$ .

3706040,Prove that the set of rapidly increasing functions is uncountable using diagonalization,"Problem A function $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ is defined to be rapidly increasing if $$f(n+1)\geq 2^{f(n)}$$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . Let Rapid be the set of rapidly increasing functions. Use a diagonalization argument to prove that Rapid is uncountable. Can someone please verify the following solution attempt? Solution Assume, by contradiction, that Rapid is countable. Then, there is an enumeration $f_0,f_1,f_2,\cdots$ of the elements in Rapid. Let $f_k$ denote the $k$ -th function in the enumeration. Define a new function $F$ as follows, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ : $$F(n) = 2^{\max(f_0(n), \cdots, f_n(n))}$$ Claim 1 : $F$ is not in the enumeration of the elements of Rapid. Proof . For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , $F(n) \neq f_n(n)$ . Therefore, $F$ differs from each $f_0,f_1,f_2,\cdots$ in the enumeration. Claim 2 : $F$ is in Rapid. That is: $$F(n+1) \geq 2^{F(n)}$$ $$2^{\max(f_0(n+1), f_1(n+1), \cdots, f_{n+1}(n+1))} \geq 2^{2^{\max(f_0(n), f_1(n), ..., f_n(n))}}$$ Proof . For the Claim 2 to be true, it's sufficient that: $$\max(f_0(n+1), f_1(n+1), \cdots, f_{n+1}(n+1)) \geq 2^{max(f_0(n), f_1(n), \cdots, f_n(n))}\text{ (*)}$$ Let $f_i(n+1)$ be the value of left-hand side $\max$ expression of (*), and $f_j(n)$ be the value of the right-hand side $\max$ expression of (*), where $0 \leq i \leq n + 1$ and $0 \leq j \leq n$ . That is: $$f_i(n+1) = \max(f_0(n+1), f_1(n+1), \cdots, f_{n+1}(n+1))$$ $$f_j(n) = \max(f_0(n), f_1(n), \cdots, f_n(n))$$ If $f_i = f_j$ , then (*) follows directly, by definition, from the fact that $f_i$ is in Rapid: $f_i(n+1) \geq 2^{f_i(n)}$ . Therefore, in this case, the Claim 2 is true. Now, assume that $f_i \neq f_j$ . Assume, by contradiction, that (*) is false, that is, $f_i(n+1) < 2^{f_j(n)}$ . Since $f_j$ is in Rapid, we have, by definition: $f_j(n+1) \geq 2^{f_j(n)}$ . But $f_i(n+1) < 2^{f_j(n)}$ and $f_j(n+1) \geq 2^{f_j(n)}$ imply that: $$f_i(n+1) < 2^{f_j(n)} \leq f_j(n+1)$$ $$f_i(n+1) < f_j(n+1),$$ which contradicts the assumption that $f_i(n+1) = \max(f_0(n+1), f_1(n+1), \cdots, f_{n+1}(n+1))$ . Therefore, it can't be the case that $f_i(n+1) < 2^{f_j(n)}$ with $i \neq j$ . So, $f_i(n+1) \geq 2^{f_j(n)}$ , which means that (*) is true, and therefore $F$ is in Rapid. From Claim 1 and Claim 2, we defined a function $F$ that is not in the enumeration of all rapidly increasing functions, but which is in Rapid. This contradicts the assumption that we have an enumeration of all rapidly increasing functions. So, such an enumeration cannot exist. Therefore, Rapid is uncountable.","['elementary-set-theory', 'solution-verification', 'discrete-mathematics']"

To get started I computed the case in $\textbf{R}^2$ , letting $a=(p,q)$ and writing $x=(x,y)$ (pardon the abuse of notation.) We can write $\|(x,y)\|^2=x^2+y^2.$ So that \begin{align*}
\int_{\textbf{R}^2} \langle x,a \rangle ^2 e^{-\frac{1}{2} \|x\| ^2}&=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(p^2x^2+2pqxy+q^2y^2)e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}\,dxdy\\
&=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}p^2x^2e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}\,dxdy + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}2pqxy e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}\,dxdy\\&+ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}q^2y^2e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}\,dxdy.
\end{align*} Applying Fubini's theorem and using the well known Gaussian integral, the first integral summand is $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}p^2x^2e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}\,dxdy=p^2\int_{\infty}^{\infty}x^2e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}\,dx \int_{\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}\,dy=2\pi p^2.$$ By symmetry, $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}q^2y^2e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}\,dxdy=2\pi q^2$$ If we factor out $2pq$ from the middle summand integral, and apply Fubini's theorem, we get $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}2pqxy e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}\,dxdy=2pq\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xe^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}\,dx\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}ye^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}\,dy.$$ Both integrals are of odd functions taken over a domain symmetric about 0, so they both vanish. Then we get $$\int_{\textbf{R}^2} \langle x,a \rangle ^2 e^{-\frac{1}{2} \|x\| ^2}=2\pi(p^2+q^2).$$ This leads me to the following guess in the $\textbf{R}^n$ case: if $a=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)$ , then $$\int_{\textbf{R}^n} \langle x,a \rangle ^2 e^{-\frac{1}{2} \|x\| ^2}=(2\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}}(a_1^2+\ldots+a_n^2).$$ The justification for this guess would similar to the result I got from the above computation: if we write $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n),$ then we can split the integral by linearity according to the multinomial expansion of $\langle x,a \rangle ^2.$ In this expansion, all integrals of functions containing products of mixed $x_i$ 's will vanish, since the maximal power of any term of mixed $x_i$ 's will be 1 by the definition of squares of multinomials. This will leave only integrals of squares of one such $x_i$ . Splitting each such integral by Fubini's theorem and evaluating will result in an $n$ -fold product of $\sqrt{2\pi},$ multiplied by the corresponding square $a_i^2.$ Is this guess justified correctly? If not, any hints in the right direction would be appreciated. I have a suspicion this is not the slickest way to justify this.","['improper-integrals', 'multivariable-calculus', 'definite-integrals']"

3706376,A problem posed by Ramanujan involving $\sum e^{-5\pi n^2}$,"While going through the list of problems posed by Ramanujan in Journal of Indian Mathematical Society I came across this problem involving theta functions: Prove that $$\frac{1}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-\pi n^2x}\cos(\pi n^2\sqrt{1-x^2})=\frac{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{1+x}}{\sqrt{1-x}}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}e^{-\pi n^2x}\sin(\pi n^2\sqrt{1-x^2})$$ and deduce the following: ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-\pi n^2}=\sqrt{5\sqrt{5}-10}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-5\pi n^2}\right)} $ ${\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-\pi n^2}\left(\pi n^2-\frac{1}{4}\right)=\frac{1}{8}} $ The sums in above problem are clearly based on theta functions and we use a simplified notation here to define them. If $\tau$ is any complex number with positive imaginary part then we define $$\vartheta(\tau) =\sum_{n\in\mathbb {Z}} e^{\pi i\tau n^2}$$ and one of the key properties of theta function defined above is $$\vartheta(\tau) =(-i\tau) ^{-1/2}\vartheta(-1/\tau)$$ Ramanujan's first formula probably assumes that $x\in(0,1)$ and hence one can write $x=\cos t$ with $t\in(0,\pi/2)$ and we can consider the complex number $\tau=\sin t +i\cos t$ which clearly has positive imaginary part. The choice of $\tau$ in this manner is done because it gives us $$(-i\tau) ^{-1/2}=\cos(t/2) +i\sin(t/2)=\sqrt{\frac{1+x}{2}}+i\sqrt{\frac{1-x}{2}}$$ and $$-1/\tau=-\sin t+i\cos t=-\sqrt{1-x^2}+ix$$ Using this value of $\tau$ in the transformation formula for theta functions we get $$1+2A+2iB=\frac{\sqrt{1+x}+i\sqrt{1-x}}{\sqrt{2}}(1+2A-2iB)$$ where $$A=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}e^{-\pi n^2x}\cos(\pi n^2\sqrt{1-x^2}),B=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-\pi n^2x}\sin(\pi n^2\sqrt{1-x^2})$$ and equating real parts we get $$1+2A=(1+2A)\sqrt {\frac{1+x}{2}}+2B\sqrt{\frac{1-x}{2}}$$ or $$\frac{1}{2}+A=\frac{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{1+x}}{\sqrt{1-x}}B$$ In this manner the key formula of Ramanujan is established. Out of the next two corollaries I was able to prove the second one easily by dividing the main formula by $\sqrt{1-x^2}$ and then taking limits as $x\to 1^{-}$ . The first one dealing with $\sum e^{-5\pi n^2}$ was really looking difficult to obtain. My question is How to obtain the first corollary dealing with $\sum e^{-5\pi n^2}$ from the main formula of Ramanujan? Since the formula appears to be using $x\in(0,1)$ I don't see a way to put $x=5$ . Even if one does that both sides will contain the sums involving $\sum e^{-5\pi n^2}$ and it appears rather mysterious to obtain a link between $\sum e^{-\pi n^2}$ and $\sum e^{-5\pi n^2}$ . The link between these two sums can be obtained using a modular equation of degree 5, but the calculations involved are tedious (for this technique in action see this answer which evaluates $\sum_{n\in\mathbb {Z}} e^{-3\pi n^2}$ ). I was therefore hoping for some easier approach as indicated by Ramanujan. Maybe I am mising something obvious here.","['theta-functions', 'sequences-and-series']"

3706602,The Algebra-Geometric Motivation Behind Considering The Prime Spectrum of Arbitrary Rings,"When being introduced to algebraic geometry I was told that it is all about finding solutions to polynomial equations. In the case that we have a polynomial equation over some algebraically closed field $K =\overline{K}$ , by Hilbert‘s Nullstellensatz we find that studying the irreducible algebraic sets amounts to studying prime ideals of $K[T_1,...,T_n]$ . Now, if I want to solve polynomials over, say $\Bbb R$ or even $\Bbb Z$ , then this correspondence does not hold any longer. Yet by considering $\Bbb Z \subseteq \Bbb Q \subseteq \Bbb C$ we can try to solve the equations in $\Bbb C$ and cut away noninteger solutions. So in this light it seems like the classical setting of algebraic geometry is completely sufficient and we should put most of our effort into studying $\operatorname{Spec}K[T_1,...,T_n]$ . However (maybe I misunderstood?) I thought that the motivation behind doing algebraic geometry over arbitrary rings was solving polynomials over arbitrary rings as well. But since the correspondence theorem relies on Hilbert‘s Nullstellensatz I don’t see how to connect this directly to the prime spectra of such rings. Is there a way to make sense of this correspondence or am I on the wrong track? Of cause the mere presence of the functor $\operatorname{Spec}:\mathsf{CRing}^\text{op}\rightarrow \mathsf{Top}$ makes the prime spectrum worth studying from the point of view of finding topological invariants for rings. And I would be fine with the geometry of the prime spectrum being a relict of / a crude analogy to the „real“ geometry in the classical setting, from which we can draw intuition and inspiration.","['ring-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'polynomials']"

  the evader ( $E$ ) at the centre. For what all $n$ can be the evader be caught?
  Pursuers and evader have same speed For $n≥3$ , pursuers win. Consider the case with $3$ pursuers. Consider the equilateral triangle whose midpoints are given by the initial positions of the pursuers. Each pursuer simply moves along their side of this triangle as per the projection of the evader along that side. ( $P_i E$ is perpendicular to side and $P_i$ lies on side). Since there will be leftover scope for movement, shift one of the sides closer while maintaining it parallel. The triangle will no longer be equilateral but its angles will still be $60$ degrees. Repeat until triangle becomes point sized. In worst case this requires pursuers to move $2\Delta x + \epsilon$ for every $\Delta x$ of evader movement ( $2\Delta x$ to maintain the perpendicular condition for all three sides, and $\epsilon$ additionally to shift a side). What if we were restricted to $\Delta x$ movement? Assume $n$ pursuers on the vertices of an $n$ sided polygon and a single
  evader at the centre. Pursuers must move such that the sum of their
  speeds (absolute) does not exceed the evader's speed. For what all $n$ can the
  evader be caught? A practical case where this situation might occur is where play is turn by turn. Consider the version discrete in time and space, where on each turn - exactly one pursuer can move one unit and the evader can move unit. How can this be solved?

By definition, put $$
S_p(g) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{p-4}3}\cos \left(\frac{2\pi}{p}g^{3k}\right) ,\;
S'_p(g) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\sum_{k=0}^{\frac{p-4}3}\cos \left(\frac{2\pi}{p}g^{3k+1}\right), \;
S''_p(g)  \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{p-4}3}\cos \left(\frac{2\pi}{p}g^{3k+2}\right)
$$ Suppose $p=9m^2+3m+1,\, m\in \mathbb Z$ . Then for any primitive root $g$ $$
\sqrt[3]{S_p(g)} +  \sqrt[3]{S'_p(g)} +  \sqrt[3]{S''_p(g)} =\sqrt[3]{ 3\sqrt[3]{mp}-(6m+1) }
$$ I found the following extension. Suppose $p=9m^2+3am+a^2,\, m\in \mathbb Z, a\in \mathbb N, a$ is not a multiple of 3. The result can be extended to: For $a \equiv 1 \mod 3$ $$
\sqrt[3]{S_p(g)+n} +  \sqrt[3]{S'_p(g)+n} +  \sqrt[3]{S''_p(g)+n} =\sqrt[3]{ 3\sqrt[3]{mp}-(6m+a) },\,\,n=-\frac{a-1}{3}

As discussed in this question, $f$ need not be in $L^2(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ . Moreover, $f$ can be continuous and differentiable and still not be square-integrable. My question is if there are ""simple"" assumptions one can make about $f$ such that it lies in $L^2(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ .","['measure-theory', 'lp-spaces', 'probability']"

3707227,Strategy to calculate $ \frac{d}{dx} \left(\frac{x^2-6x-9}{2x^2(x+3)^2}\right) $.,"I am asked to calculate the following: $$ \frac{d}{dx} \left(\frac{x^2-6x-9}{2x^2(x+3)^2}\right). $$ I simplify this a little bit, by moving the constant multiplicator out of the derivative: $$ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \frac{d}{dx} \left(\frac{x^2-6x-9}{x^2(x+3)^2}\right) $$ But, using the quotient-rule , the resulting expressions really get unwieldy: $$ \frac{1}{2} \frac{(2x-6)(x^2(x+3)^2) -(x^2-6x-9)(2x(2x^2+9x+9))}{(x^2(x+3)^2)^2} $$ I came up with two approaches (3 maybe): Split the terms up like this: $$ \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{(2x-6)(x^2(x+3)^2)}{(x^2(x+3)^2)^2} - \frac{(x^2-6x-9)(2x(2x^2+9x+9))}{(x^2(x+3)^2)^2} \right) $$ so that I can simplify the left term to $$ \frac{2x-6}{x^2(x+3)^2}. $$ Taking this approach the right term still doesn't simplify nicely, and I struggle to combine the two terms into one fraction at the end. The brute-force-method. Just expand all the expressions in numerator and denominator, and add/subtract monomials of the same order. This definitely works, but i feel like a stupid robot doing this. The unofficial third-method. Grab a calculator, or computer-algebra-program and let it do the hard work. Is there any strategy apart from my mentioned ones? Am I missing something in my first approach which would make the process go more smoothly?

3707342,Deriving the expansion of $\sin (\alpha - \beta)$ using $\sin x = \sqrt{1-\cos^2 x}$,"I was deriving the expansion of  the expansion of $\sin (\alpha - \beta)$ given that $\cos (\alpha - \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta$ Now, my textbook has done it in a different manner but I thought of doing it using the simple trigonometric identity $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1 \implies \sin x = \sqrt{1-\cos^2 x}$ . I thought that it would be pretty easy (it probably is), until I got stuck in the final part which included the modulus function. Here's how I did it : $$\sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sqrt {1 - \cos^2 (\alpha - \beta)} = \sqrt{1-(\cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta)^2}$$ By substituting $1$ as $\sin^2\alpha + \cos^2\alpha$ and expanding $(\cos \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \alpha \sin \beta)^2$ , we get : $$\therefore \sin (\alpha - \beta) = \sqrt{\sin^2\alpha + \cos^2\alpha - \cos^2\alpha\cos^2\beta-
\sin^2\alpha\sin^2\beta-2\sin\alpha\sin\beta\cos\alpha\cos\beta}$$ $$\therefore \sin(\alpha-\beta) = \sqrt{\sin^2\alpha (1-\sin^2\beta)+\cos^2\alpha(1-\cos^2\beta)-2\sin\alpha\sin\beta\cos\alpha\cos\beta}$$ $$\therefore \sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sqrt{\sin^2\alpha\cos^2\beta+\cos^2\alpha\sin^2\beta-2\sin\alpha\sin\beta\cos\alpha\cos\beta}$$ $$\therefore \sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sqrt{(\sin\alpha\cos\beta - \cos\alpha\sin\beta)^2} = |\sin\alpha\cos\beta-\cos\alpha\sin\beta|$$ Now, how do I get rid of the modulus sign? I do know that I must decide whether the expression inside the modulus functions in positive or negative, but I can't seem to decide how. Thanks!",['trigonometry']
