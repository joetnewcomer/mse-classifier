Then is every LCV is barreled.  I think,  i am confusing with something... Every absorbing set contains zero.   Because if $A$ is absorbing set then there is some $t>0$ such that $0\in tA$, that is we have $0= t.a$ for some $a\in A$.
This gives $a=0\in A$. So My question is: If every absorbing set contains zero, then it means that every LCV is barreled.. so what is need to defined barreled in LCV.. can i get some topological vector space which is not barreled","['topological-vector-spaces', 'locally-convex-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

272083,Kind of counter intuitive sum of log gamma,"I came across an infinite series that appears to be rather counter intuitive. Show that $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{k+1}\ln(\Gamma(k+1))=\frac{-1}{4}\ln\left (\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ At first glance, it obviously diverges.  I ran this through Mathematica for a check and that is what it said, ""sum does not converge"". But, I ran it through Maple as $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{k+1}\ln(k!)$ and it actually returned the above result.  Mathematica still would not. If I entered it in using the Gamma function instead of its equivalent factorial, it would not return the result. What is going on here?.  I presume this has something to do with analytic continuation of some sort?. Since $k!=\Gamma(k+1)$,  why would Maple return the result for the factorial but would not for the Gamma even though they are essentially the same thing?. It reminds me of $\zeta(0)=\frac{-1}{2}$. If we just let $s=0$ in $\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{s}}$ we get an infinite string of 1's.  But, using the functional equation, it can be shown to converge to -1/2. How can the above sum be shown to equal $\frac{-1}{4}\ln\left (\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$?. I searched all around for something on this, but could find nothing. Thanks all.

272102,When does locally irreducible imply irreducible?,"The situation is this: I have a homogeneous ideal with many generators and variables, too many to simply ask isPrime I in Macaulay2. However, the ideal simplifies significantly when localizing in each variable (that is, setting one of the variables equal to one and substitute everywhere for lone variables). It turns out, when localized in each variable, the ideal $I_{(x_i)}$ is prime. The question is, when can I conclude that the ideal itself is prime? I cannot in general do this, because there are examples of rings with all localizations integral domains, but not the ring itself (take for example $\mathbb{Z}/(6)$ and localize in only two primes to get $\mathbb{Z}/(3)$ and $\mathbb{Z}/(2)$). In my case, the ideal is $I \subseteq k[x_1,\cdots, x_{20}]$, with $k$ an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero (or just $\mathbb{C}$). Thinking about this, it seems that if there are ""sufficiently many prime ideals"", then it is true that locally prime implies prime, but I have not been able to prove this.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
272103,Gradient of a Lipschitz function on a Riemannian manifold.,"I'm referring to the article of D. Fischer-Colbrie and R. Schoen The structure of complete stable minimal surfaces in 3-Manifolds of non-negative scalar curvature ( journal link , pdf ). In the proof of theorem 2 the smooth function in the definition (8) is composed with the distance function $r$ (from $0$). This composition is a Lipschitz function (since $r$ is a Lipschitz function) with compact support. Then this composition belongs in the Sobolev space $H^1$ and then it admits a weak gradient. Now I don't understand because the norm of this gradient is equal to the norm of the derivative of the function in (8).(this fact is implicitly used in the estimates below (8)). The distance function $r$ does not lie in $H^1$, then I don't think that I can use the formula of the derivation of a composition (moreover we have to be careful to treat about the gradient of the distance function $r$).","['sobolev-spaces', 'differential-geometry']"

272109,Differentiation with respect to integral boundary,"Using the chain rule show the following proposition: Let $f$ be continuously on $[a,b]$ and $g:J\to[a,b]$ continuously differentiable for an interval $J$. We write $$H(x)=\int\limits_{a}^{g(x)}f(t)\,\mathrm dt,\qquad x\in J.$$ $H$ is differentiable and one has $$H'(x)=f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)g'(x).$$ After proving the correctness of the proposition use it to compute the derivative of $$H(x)=\int\limits_{1}^{\exp(x)}\ln(2t)\,\mathrm dt.$$ Proof. Let $h\in\mathbb{R}$ with $h>0$ and $x+h\in[a,b]$. Then we know that $$\begin{align}
	\frac{H(x+h)-H(x)}{h} &= \frac{1}{h}\left(\int\limits_{a}^{g(x+h)}f(t)\,\mathrm dt - \int\limits_{a}^{g(x)}f(t)\,\mathrm dt\right)\\
	&= \frac{1}{h}\int\limits_{g(x)}^{g(x+h)}f(t)\,\mathrm dt\\
	&\overset{(1)}{=} \frac{1}{h}\int\limits_{x}^{x+h}f(g(t))g'(t)\,\mathrm dt = \frac{1}{h}\int\limits_{x}^{x+h}H'(t)\,\mathrm dt\\
	&\overset{(2)}{=} \frac{1}{h}\cdot h\cdot H'(\xi)=H'(\xi),\qquad \xi\in[x,x+h].
\end{align}$$ In $(1)$ we just use backwards substitution for integration to move $g$ out of the integral boundary into the integrand. $(2)$ is more tricky because we know that for every continuously function $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ there exists one $\xi\in[a,b]$ with $$\int\limits^b_af(x)\,\mathrm dx=(b-a)f(\xi).$$ In our case it is obvious that $(x+h)-x=h$. Now we see that $h\to 0$ yields $\xi\to x$ and therefore $$\frac{H(x+h)-H(x)}{h}\longrightarrow H'(x).$$ The same principle applies for $h<0$ and $h\to 0$.$\quad\square$ Example. Let now $$H(x)=\int\limits_{1}^{\exp(x)}\ln(2t)\,\mathrm dt$$ then $f(t)=\ln(2t),\,g(t)=\exp(t)$. This yields $$\begin{align}
	H'(x)&=\ln(2\exp(x))\cdot\exp(x)=\exp(x)(x+\ln(2)).
\end{align}$$ I would like to know whether my approach is correct and whether I could simplify some steps in there, as I usually do everything more complicated than neccessary.","['derivatives', 'integration', 'real-analysis']"

Some background: In Centralizer of a finite normal subgroup has finite index I showed that if the derived subgroup is finite and the quotient has a set of generators whose representatives in $G$ commute pairwise, then the center of $G$ has finite index (since in this case, we get $G = G'H$ where $H$ is the subgroup generated by those representatives).

272155,Solve differential equation with variation of parameters,"I'm having a little trouble understanding how to solve the following differential equation.
The equation that has to be solved is:
$$y'' - y' - 2y = 2e^{-t}$$ The problem I am having is that I don't understand why they equate that part with the derivatives of the $u$ parameters to $0$. See the problem below Example 13. Problem 2: $y''-y'-2y=2e^{-t}$. The characteristic equation is:
  $$r^2-r-2=0\iff (r-2)(r-1)=0\implies y_h(t)=c_1e^{2t}+c2e^{-t}.$$
  Suppose that $y(t)=u_1(t)e^{2t}+u_2(t)e^{-t}$, then it follows:
  $$ y'(t)=\underbrace{u_1'(t)e^{2t}+u_2'(t)e^{-t}}_{=0}+2u_1(t)e^{2t}-u_2(t)e^{-t} $$ Here they first find the characteristic equation and write down the general solution. They then replace the constants with the parameter ""$u$"" and take the derivative. As you can see, they just say that the derivative part of the $u$ parameter is equal to $0$. But why? How?

272195,Quasi-Coherent modules over sheaves of rings (proof question),"Let $X$ be a scheme with structure sheaf $\mathcal O_X$ and let $\mathcal B$ be a quasi-coherent $\mathcal O_X$-algebra. Let $\mathcal F$ be any sheaf of $\mathcal B$-modules. In EGA I, § 9, Prop. 9.6.1 it is asserted that then the following holds: Then $\mathcal F$ is quasi-coherent over $\mathcal B$ if and only if $\mathcal F$ is quasi-coherent over $\mathcal O_
X$. The proof of the implication $\Rightarrow$ is easy, but the other direction is hard to digest for me: EGA argues as follows: we may work locally on $X$, hence assume $X=Spec(A)$, whence $\mathcal B$ corresponds to a $A$-algebra $B$ and $\mathcal F$ corresponds to a $B$-module $M$ (namely, because $\mathcal B$ and $\mathcal F$ are quasi-coherent over $\mathcal O_X$). Then it reads without explanation that $M$ is isomorphic to the cokernel of a map $(*) \quad B^{(I)} \rightarrow B^{(J)}$, and hence by taking the tilde-construction we see that $\mathcal F$ is quasi-coherent over $\mathcal B$. Apriori, one should only be able to write $M$ as a cokernel of a map $(*)$ with $B$ replaced by $A$, but tensoring with $B$ doesn't seem to give $M$ as cokernel, but $M\otimes_A B$. My question is why one may write $M$ as a cokernel of a map $(*)$, as claimed in EGA. Or any other proof of the desired implication ""$\mathcal F$ quasi-coherent over $\mathcal O_X \Rightarrow \mathcal F$ quasi-coherent over $\mathcal B$"" would be very appreciated.","['alternative-proof', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

I have some ideas but i don't know if there are good. Here my ideas: Choose $[a,b]$ and $(a,b)$ in $\Bbb{R}$ such that the intersection with $X$ is the same. Notice that $X$ does not contain an open interval because the interior is empty. Then $X\cap[a,b]=X\cap(a,b)$ is the clopen set we search for. Is this good or miss i something? For the second one i want to prove that the one-point-compactification $X_{\infty}$ is totally separated. I know that this is true for $X$, because $X$ is discrete and thus all subsets are clopen. But what about the one-point-compactification (because then we can use the lemma to conclude that $X_{\infty}$ is a Stone-space). We know that the functions in the space are bounded. Thus if we choose $\epsilon>0$ arbitrary we can find a minimal $n\in\Bbb{N}$ such that $|f|<n\epsilon$.

272654,"Confused by proof in Rudin Functional Analysis, metrization of topological vector space with countable local base","I'm working through Rudin's Functional Analysis, and I am confused by a step in his proof for Theorem 1.24, which states that if X is a topological vector space with a countable local base, then there is a metric d on X such that a) d is compatible with the topology of X b) the open balls are balanced c) d is invariant and, if X is locally convex, then all open balls are convex. Here is a slimmed down version of his proof: By his theorem 1.14, X has a balanced local base $\{V_n\}$ such that $V_{n+1} + V_{n+1} + V_{n+1} + V_{n+1} \subset V_n$. D is the set of all rational numbers r of the form $\Sigma_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n(r) 2^{-n}$, where each of the digits $c_i(r)$ is 0 or 1 and only finitely many are 1. Define A(r) = X if $r \geq 1$. For any r in D, define A(r) = $\Sigma c_n(r)V_n$. (Note each is a finite sum). Define $f(x) = \inf \{r : x \in A(r)\}$ for $x \in X$ and d(x,y) = f(x - y). Rudin proves an inclusion $A(r) + A(s) \subset A(r + s)$ and uses it to show that $\{A(r)\}$ is totally ordered by set inclusion and that $f(x + y) \leq f(x) + f(y)$. As each A(r) is balanced, $f(x) = f(-x)$. $f(0) = 0$. If x$\not = 0$, then $x \not \in V_n = A(2^{-n})$ for some n, so $f(x) \geq 2^{-n} > 0$. I don't understand how he then concludes that $d(x,y) = f(x -y)$ - ""these properties of f show that d(x,y) defines a translation invariant metric d on X$."" Specifically, it is obvious that if z = 0, then $d(x + z, y + z) = d(x,y)$. But to show $d(x + z, y + z) \leq d(x,y)$, I have tried this: $d(x + z, y + z)  = f( (x + z) - (y+ z)) \leq f(x) + f(y) + 2f(z)$, which overestimates $f(x) + f(y)$ since $f(z)> 0$ and thus shows diddly-squat.

272813,Geometric interpretation of the fundamental theorem for coalgebras?,"Given an element $m$ in a coalgebra $C$, there always exists a finite-dimensional subcoalgebra $D \subset C$ containing $m$; this is the fundamental theorem for coalgebras. This obviously isn't the case for algebras. However, to make a proper analogue of this theorem for algebras, one should formulate this theorem using arrows and then dualize. An element of $C$ determines a linear map $F:\mathbb{k} \to C$ and vice versa. The fundamental theorem then becomes: For any linear map $F: \mathbb{k} \to C$ there exists a map $G:\mathbb{k} \to D$, such that $i \circ G=F$, for $D$ some finite dimensional coalgebra, and $i$ an injective map of coalgebras. Dualizing to algebras, one easily sees that the statement becomes equivalent to the question: is any linear map $f:A \to \mathbb{k}$ zero on an ideal of finite codimension, where $A$ is any algebra. Spelling this out for $k[x]$, one is led to the question: do there exist sequences $(f_{n})_{n}$ that do not satisfy any recursion equation. Does anyone know about a sequence like this, or an existence proof? A perhaps less sensical question: does the reformulation of the fundamental theorem in terms of algebras have some nice geometrical interpretation?

It is known (and easy to verify) that this is a nonnegative-definite kernel over $[0,T]$ for any $T>0$. Fix $T>0$. Let's calculate the eigenfunctions of the transformation $\mathcal T_kf=\intop_{0}^T k(x,y)f(y)dy$: $$ \lambda\psi(x)=\intop_{0}^T \min(x,y)\psi(y)dy=$$
$$ \intop_{0}^x \min(x,y)\psi(y)dy - \intop_{T}^x \min(x,y)\psi(y)dy=$$
$$ \intop_{0}^x y\psi(y)dy - x\intop_{T}^x \psi(y)dy\implies$$
$$ \lambda\psi'(x)= x\psi(x)-x\psi(x)-\intop_{T}^x \psi(y)dy\implies$$
$$ -\lambda\psi''(x)= \psi(x)\implies$$
$$\psi(x)=C_1\sin\frac x {\sqrt\lambda} + C_2\cos\frac x {\sqrt\lambda}$$ it seems like we're allowed to pick $C_1=1$ and $C_2=0$. So we pick $\psi_n(x)=\sin nx $ and $\lambda_n = n^{-2}$. Then Mercer's theorem actually says that we should get:
$$ \min(x,y)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-2}\sin nx\sin ny$$ this all seem very nice, but when evaluating this numerically, it doesn't work.
I tried also to normalize $\psi$ by dividing by its norm which is $\sqrt {\frac 1 {4n}  (2nT-\sin2nT)}$, and it didn't help. So what's wrong here?

272872,Some intuitive vision on abstract algebra,"I'm currently on my second year of Mathematics and first one I'm learning abstract algebra. So far it's being the most interesting subject I've seen, but I have a problem with some intuitive visions about it that some teachers (out of experience I guess) have with this. Particularly, I heard one of them saying it was trivial that, under isomorphisms: $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \subset A_4$ That meaning a subgroup of $A_4$ is isomorphic to the left side of the expression. I don't see that trivial at all until you do some study on $A_4$ (btw, it's the alternating group of order 12), and you find that there are elements of order 2 x,y, for which is true that $xy=yx$, you can deduce the next is a subgroup of $A_4$: $H=\{1,x,y,xy\}$. Once yo get here, the isomorphism between $H$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ may look trivial, but I don't understand how, from just an alternating group, you can deduce that just by looking. Is there any intuitive vision on groups, either general or in this particular case, that I'm missing and could help me ""see"" these things? Also, would you recommend some book that makes a special effort explaining, not the formalism, which you can find in any book, but this more intuitive view? Thanks, in advance. EDIT: Ok, so my first question has been answered, thank you all guys. Now, my second, about the book, if anyone knows a book that's ""famous"" for begin great in group theory (elementary group theory), or that deals with the subject at an intuitive level (I won't give up the formal treatment), I would appreciate a name or author. EDIT2: @jspecter
This was very usefull, thank you. A couple of questions, I don't understand the group $Stab_\Sigma(P)$: I'm not english an I don't know the meaning of ""tabalizes"", may be a typo... The second, I think I'm having some trouble thinking about the $\mathbb{Z}/m\times ... \times \mathbb{Z}/r$, I'm seeing them as ordered sets of as much integers as factors you have $(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$, (I don't know the word for that in english either, we called them n-tuplas (spanish)). Maybe my difficulties are with seeing the isomorphism between these groups and the symmetry groups $A_n$. 
With this particular example, if we take your subset $P$, which we can see as a triangle in a plane, and we create the group of symmetries of this figure we have the identity and 3 reflexions on the mediatrice of each vertex, this is what we identify with $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2=\{(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)\}$.  Obviously we identify two reflexions with (1,0) and (0,1), and the other is a combination of the other two, plus it's abelian (just like any four element group), is that the way you're seeing it? I think I have difficulties identifying these members (i,j) with functions, in this case isometries for that triangle, any advice for this? Overall, you helped a lot and I'm starting to see the whole thing more clear. Thank you again. Still, if someone recommends a book, I would be gratefull.","['soft-question', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

272905,Understanding Set Notation,"I'm having some trouble understanding a definition and explanation in my textbook Introduction to Analysis by Edward Gaughan 5th edition . The book begins with some preliminary information about sets and some of the information is sort of confusing and I have a feeling that in this sort of class if you don't understand the basics you are doomed. So hopefully somebody out there can help me understand the confusing bits a little better. So the definition in question is as follows: Let $\Lambda$ be a set, and suppose for each $\lambda \in \Lambda$ , a subset $A_{\lambda}$ of a given set S is specified. The collection of sets $A_{\lambda}$ is called an indexed family of subsets of S with $\Lambda$ as the index set. We denote this by ${\{ A \}}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ If ${\{ A \}}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ is an indexed family of sets, define $\cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ $A_{\lambda}$ = {x : x $\in A_{\lambda}$ for all $\lambda \in \Lambda$ } $\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ $A_{\lambda}$ = {x : x $\in A_{\lambda}$ for some $\lambda \in \Lambda$ } Alright so the definition above I thought was straightforward, but then the text goes on to say this: There is one logical difficulty here that needs to be pointed out. If $\Lambda$ is the empty set, then it is easy to see that $\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} A_{\lambda}$ is empty; however, it is not clear what to expect of $\cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} A_{\lambda}$ . The bolded explanation is what I do not understand. If $\Lambda$ is the empty set there will be no subsets to union because there are no elements $\lambda \in \Lambda$ but why is it not clear that $\cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} A_{\lambda}$ is also empty, won't there also be no subsets $A_{\lambda}$ to seek the intersection of?? The text ends with the following conclusion: In a context where all sets considered are understood to be subsets of a given set S, the common usage is to let: S = $\cap_{\lambda \in \oslash} A_{\lambda}$ Any information would be appreciated.","['notation', 'elementary-set-theory', 'analysis']"

Now, the caller spins the cage until 5-6 balls are out , THEN replaces all of the balls that had been called, and immediately starts the next round with the 5-6 queued balls that were not replaced. Paul wins the next game, and I start thinking: How many balls would you have to queue between rounds/games (from those not chosen) to ensure, with a certain confidence C (or a certain probability P?) that there is not a back-to-back winner? The problem gets complicated quickly, at least the way I look at it. This would surely depend on the number of players, and on the number of spaces on each board that match the winner's board.
