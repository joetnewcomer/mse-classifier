759208,Multicollinearity and SVD,"I compute the Singular Value Decomposition of a $n \times n$ matrix. If the matrix is not full rank, and I have 2 collinear columns, I end up with one singular value equal to 0. Is it possible to find out which columns of the original matrix are collinear from the result of the SVD ? This is a simple example. I would then like, for a more complicated matrix where a group of columns are multicollinear, to identify this group. Therefore I want to know if the SVD can go beyond just knowing the number of multicollinear columns and identifying the multicollinear group of columns.","['regression', 'linear-algebra', 'svd']"

759227,Question about Poisson formula,"We have the Laplace equation in polar coordinates:
$$u_{rr}+\frac{1}{r}u_r+\frac{1}{r^2}u_{\theta \theta}=0, 0 \leq r <a, 0 \leq \theta \leq 2 \pi$$ With the separation of variables, the solution is in the form $u(r \theta)=R(r) \Theta(\theta)$ Then after calculations, we get:
$$u(r, \theta)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{[A_n \cos{(n \theta)}+B_n \sin{(n \theta)}]r^n}, 0 \leq \theta \leq 2 \pi, 0 \leq r <a$$ The boundary condition is $h(\theta)=u(r=a, \theta)$ $h(\theta)$ is a periodic function with period $ 2 \pi$, so we can write it as a Fourier series. After calculations we get the following formula (Poisson formula): $$u(r, \theta)=\frac{a^2-r^2}{2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi}{ \frac{h( \phi) d \phi}{a^2+r^2-2 a r \cos{(\theta-\phi)}}}$$

$|r'|=a, |\overrightarrow{r}-\overrightarrow{r'}|^2=|\overrightarrow{r}|^2+|\overrightarrow{r'}|^2-2|\overrightarrow{r}||\overrightarrow{r'}| \cos{(\theta-\phi)}=r^2+a^2-2ar \cos{(\theta - \phi)}$ So we can write the equation also:
$$u(r, \theta)=\frac{a^2-r^2}{2 \pi a} \int_{|\overrightarrow{r'}|=a}{\frac{u(\overrightarrow{r'})ds}{|\overrightarrow{r}-\overrightarrow{r'}|^2}}(*)$$

759264,Klein Bottle Embedding on $\mathbb{R}^4$.,"First of all, I am aware of the question in How to embed Klein Bottle into $R^4$ , which was inconclusive. Anyway, I've made some progress, but I still have a question. I am using Do Carmo's Riemannian Geometry, and struggling to solve a problem. The problem is: Show that the mapping $G:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^4$ given by $$G(x,y)=((r\cos (4\pi y)+a)\cos (4\pi x),(r\cos (4\pi y)+a)\sin (4\pi x),r\sin (4\pi y)\cos (2\pi x),r\sin (4\pi y)\sin (2\pi x)))$$ induces an embedding of the Klein bottle into $\mathbb{R}^4$ (It is a slightly different function from the one in the book, but works in the same way). First of all, it's not hard to see that 
$$G(x+n,y+m)=G(x,y)\text{ whenever }m,n\in\mathbb{Z}.$$
Therefore, this mapping is well-defined over the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$. What I need now is to show that $G(-x,-y)=G(A(x,y))=G(x,y)$, where $A$ is the antipode mapping. If this were true, then the mapping G would be well-defined over the Klein Bottle, but it's obvious that this is false. Am I working wrong here somewhere?","['riemannian-geometry', 'klein-bottle', 'differential-geometry']"

759402,Definition of upper hemicontinuity of a correspondence.,"When using and examining Kakutani's fixed-point theorem, I've got a question about upper hemicontinuity. A correspondence $f:X\rightarrow2^Y$ is a point-to-set mapping. One way to define upper hemicontinuity of $f$ is as below. Given such a $f$, $f$ is said to be upper hemicontinuous at $\bar{x}$ if for every open set $V$ such that $f(\bar{x})\subset V$, there exists an open set $U$ such that $\bar{x}\in U$ and $x\in U$ implies $f(x)\subset V$. However, I once read a different definition of upper hemicontinuity on a textbook: Given such a correspondence $f$, $f$ is said to be upper hemicontinuous at $\bar{x}$ if for every sequence $\{x_n\}\rightarrow\bar{x}$ and for every open set $V$ such that $f(\bar{x})\subset V$, there exists an $N\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(x_n)\subset V,~\forall n\geq N$. Can someone help me prove that these two definitions are equivalent?

759403,Cauchy-Euler Equation of order $n$,"What I wish to prove is that for a Cauchy-Euler equation of order $n$, the substitution $x=e^{t}$ transforms it into a linear differential equation with constant coefficients. To put it as a theorem: Consider the Euler equation of order $n$
  \begin{equation}
x^{n}y^{(n)}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}y^{(n-1)}+\cdots+a_{1}xy'+a_{0}y=0
\end{equation}
  The substitution $x=e^{t}$ transforms this into a linear differential equations with constant coefficients. What I have tried I have been drawn to use a inductive proof. Having examined the first three derivatives I am lead to believe that the $n$:th derivative (with substitution $x=e^{t}$) can be written as $y^{(n)}=e^{-nt}\prod_{k=1}^{n}(D-k+1)y$, where $D$ denotes the differential operator. For the base case $n=1$ we have 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{dy}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{dy}{dx}e^{t}=\frac{dy}{dx}x \iff\frac{1}{x}\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{dy}{dx}
\end{equation}
which means that 
\begin{equation}
a_{1}x\frac{dy}{dx}+a_{0}y=0 \iff a_{1}\frac{dy}{dt}+a_{0}y=0
\end{equation}
As such, the base case clearly transforms into a linear differential equation. Now, suppose that the substitution $x=e^{t}$ transforms the $n-1$ first derivatives into a linear combination. We wish to show that this implies that $n$:th derivative can also be transformed into a linear combination
\begin{align}
\frac{d^{n}y}{dx^{n}}&=\frac{dy}{dx}\left[ \frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}} \right] \\
&=\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{-(n-1)t}\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}(D-k+1)y  \right] \\
&=\frac{d/dt}{e^{t}}\left[e^{-(n-1)} \right] \\
&=e^{-t}\left[-(n-1)e^{-(n-1)t}\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}(D-k+1)y+e^{-(n-1)t}\frac{d}{dt}\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}(D-k+1)y \right] \\

759423,The magnetic monopole and the Hopf bundle,"Consider the vector field $\textbf{B} = \frac{1}{\rho^2}\textbf{e}_\rho$ on $\mathbb{R}^3 - \{0\}$ where $(\rho, \theta, \phi)$ are the usual spherical coordinates and $\textbf{e}_\rho = \frac{\partial \rho}{|\partial \rho|}$ is the unit tangent vector in the $\rho$ direction.  $\textbf{B}$ does not have a global vector potential on $\mathbb{R}^3 - \{0\}$ by Stokes' theorem, but does have local vector potentials on $\mathbb{R}^3 - \{z_+\}$ and $\mathbb{R}^3 - \{z_-\}$ (the complement of the positive $z$-axis and negative $z$-axis, respectively).  If you pull these local vector potentials back to the $2$-sphere $S^2$ and invoke the usual identification between vector fields and $1$-forms then you get $\mu_+ = (1 - \cos \phi)d\theta$ and $\mu_- = (1 + \cos \phi)d\theta$ defined on $S_+^2$ and $S_-^2$. Now, the Hopf bundle $S^3 \to S^2$ trivializes over $S_+^2$ and $S_-^2$, yielding sections $S_+^2 \to S^3$ and $S_-^2 \to S^3$.  One can check by direct calculation that if you pull back the $1$-form
$$\omega = -x_2 dx_1 + x_1 dx_2 - x_4 dx_3 + x_3 dx_4$$
on $\mathbb{R}^4$ to $S_+^2$ and $S_-^2$ along the composition of the sections above with the inclusion $S^3 \to \mathbb{R}^4$ then you get $\mu_+$ and $\mu_-$.  Thus the Hopf bundle is home to a sort of global vector potential for the magnetic monopole. My question is: what is the geometric meaning of $\omega$? Its pullback to $S^3$ has a nice interpretation: it is a natural connection $1$-form on the Hopf bundle (maybe up to a factor of $i$).  But what about $\omega$ itself?","['gauge-theory', 'differential-geometry']"
759437,Closed conjugacy classes in $M_n(k)$,"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, $n$ a positive integer, and consider the action of $\mathrm{GL}_n(k)$ on $M_n(k)$ by conjugation. My professor tells me that semisimple conjugacy classes are closed, and his argument is as follows.  Fix $f$ a monic polynomial of degree $n$, and consider the set of matrices $A_f$ whose characteristic polynomial is $f$.  Then $A_f$ is closed, a finite union of orbits (by considering Jordan forms), and the orbit of minimal dimension is the unique semisimple conjugacy class with characteristic polynomial $f$.  Since orbits of minimal dimension are closed, this semisimple orbit is closed. A few questions I have to understand this proof: Why do we need to note that $A_f$ is closed?  It is true, but doesn't the argument work without this fact? How can I see that the semisimple orbit in $A_f$ has minimal dimension? Consider the semisimple class $S_f$ of $2\times 2$ matrices defined by the characteristic polynomial $f(x)=(x-1)(x-2)$.  Since $I_2$ satisfies this polynomial, wouldn't it be in the closure of $S_f$?  That is, doesn't $I_2$ satisfy any polynomial equation that the elements of $S_f$ satisfy, and hence $I_2$ is in the Zariski closure?  However, this can't be right because then $S_f$ is not closed (because $I_2\notin S_f$).  What is wrong with my reasoning here?","['algebraic-geometry', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'algebraic-groups', 'group-theory']"

759630,Invertible iff Bounded below and dense range,"Statement: Given a Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$ and $\mathscr{K}$ and a bounded operator $A \in \mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H}, \mathscr{K})$. Show that $A$ is invertible if and only if $A$ is bounded below and has dense range: Attempted proof: $\Rightarrow$ Since we are invertible then the range of $A$ will be equal to the $\mathscr{K}$. Furthermore, if $A$ is invertitble then $A^{-1}A = \mathbb{I}$ hence $\forall h \in \mathscr{H}\, , \|h\|=\|A^{-1}Ah\| \leq \|A^{-1}\|\|A(h)\| \rightarrow \frac{\|h\|}{\|A^{-1}\|}\leq  \|A(h)\|$ so we are bounded below. $\Leftarrow$ (this is the dirrection I get stuck in) We now assume that $A$ is bounded below and has dense range then the opeartor is invertible. Since we are bounded below then we are injective. To see this we assume by contradiction, then $\exists h\in \mathscr{H}, \, s.t. \, h \neq 0 \rightarrow A(h) = 0$, and since we are bounded below then $ \exists \delta >0 \, s.t \, \delta\|h\| \leq \|A(h)\| = 0$ so we arrive at a contradiction since the L.H.S > 0 but the R.H.S = 0. now all that remains to be shown is surjectivity. Let $\{h_n\}_{1}^{\infty}$ be a Cauchy sequence, since we are bounded from below then $\delta\|h_n-h_m\| \leq \|A(h_n-h_m)\| = \|A(h_n)-A(h_m)\|$ which implies that $\|h_n-h_m\| \leq \frac{1}{\delta}\|A(h_n)-A(h_m)\|=\frac{1}{\delta}\|A(h_n-h_m)\|\leq\frac{\|A\|}{\delta}\|h_n-h_m\|< \varepsilon$ since the last term is Cauchy we can let $\|h_n-h_m\| <\frac{\delta^2}{\|A\|} = \varepsilon$ So we know that if we are Cauchy is $\mathscr{H}$ then we are Cauchy is $\mathscr{K}$.

759722,Trouble finishing a (direct) proof that $\ell^2(A)$ is a complete metric space,"Let $A$ be any non-empty set. We can define summations of non-negative numbers over this index set by using a supremum of summations over finite subsets of $A$. That is, $$\sum\limits_{\alpha \in A} x_\alpha = \sup \{\sum\limits_{\alpha \in F} x_\alpha \vert \ F \subseteq A \ \text{is finite}\}.$$ Define $$\ell^2(A) = \{f: A \to \mathbb{C} \ \vert \sum\limits_{\alpha \in A} \lvert f(\alpha) \rvert^2< \infty \}.$$ Clearly $\ell^2(A)$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-vector space with pointwise addition and scaling. We give this vector space a norm according to $\|f\|^2= \sum\limits_{\alpha \in A} \lvert f(\alpha) \rvert^2$. This is the same as the standard definition of $L^2(\mu)$ where $\mu$ is counting measure on $A$. It is a well-known result that this norm gives $\ell^2(A)$ the structure of a Banach space. The main issue here is to show that the metric induced by this norm is complete. Following a comment in Gerald Folland's excellent text on real analysis, it should be ""rather easy"" to prove completeness directly. To that end, we take a Cauchy sequence $(f_n) \in \ell^2(A)^\mathbb{N}$ and hope to show convergence with respect to the metric. It isn't hard to show that for each $\alpha \in A$, $f_n(\alpha)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{C}$ with the usual distance metric. By completeness of this metric space, we know that $f_n(\alpha)$ converges to some number $z_\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$. We define a function $f: A \to \mathbb{C}$ by $f(\alpha)=z_{\alpha}$. Of course, $f$ is our candidate for the limit of the original sequence. To show that $f \in \ell^2(A)$, let $F \subseteq A$ be a finite subset of A and let $\epsilon >0$. Take $N \in \mathbb{N}$ so that $\|f-f_n\|<\epsilon \ \ \ \forall n \geq N$. Thus, if $n \geq N$, then $\|f_n\| < \|f_N\| + \epsilon$. Let $B = \max\{\|f_1\|, \|f_2\|, ..., \|f_{N-1}\|, \|f_N\|+\epsilon\}$. Then evidently $\|f_n\| \leq B \ \ \ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. Using this upper bound on the sequence, we conclude that $$\sum\limits_{\alpha \in F} \lvert f(\alpha) \rvert^2 = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum\limits_{\alpha \in F} \lvert f_n(\alpha) \rvert^2 \leq \limsup_{n \to \infty} \sum\limits_{\alpha \in A} \lvert f_n(\alpha) \rvert^2 = \limsup_{n \to \infty} \|f_n\|^2 \leq  B^2$$
Since this is true for every finite subset $F \subseteq A$, it follows that $$\|f\|^2= \sum\limits_{\alpha \in A} \lvert f(\alpha) \rvert^2=\sup \{\sum\limits_{\alpha \in F} \lvert f(\alpha) \rvert^2 \vert \ F \subseteq A \ \text{is finite}\} \leq B^2 < \infty $$ Now comes the part that is troubling me. We would like to say that $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum\limits_{\alpha \in A} \|f(\alpha)-f_n(\alpha) \|^2 = 0 $$ Indeed, each term in the summation converges to $0$, but the trouble is in trying to exchange the two limiting operations $\lim$ and $\sup$. Here is what I thought I should do, but I haven't been successful. For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we can choose a sequence $(F_{n,m})$ of finite subsets of A such that $$\lim_{m \to \infty} \sum\limits_{\alpha \in F_{n,m}} \|f(\alpha)-f_n(\alpha) \|^2 = \sum\limits_{\alpha \in A} \|f(\alpha)-f_n(\alpha) \|^2 $$ Then the statement above that we wanted to prove becomes $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{m \to \infty} \sum\limits_{\alpha \in F_{n,m}} \|f(\alpha)-f_n(\alpha) \|^2 =0$$ I wasn't successful in justifying that we can exchange these limits. I would very much appreciate some help in completing this proof with a minimum of hand-waving. I understand that we can characterize completeness in a normed vector space according to convergence of absolutely convergent series, and that this can be used to prove completeness of $L^p(\mu)$ in a more general sense. However, it seems like a good lesson in basic analysis to carry this direct proof through to the end. As a side note, I kicked around another idea which might be relevant: If $\sum\limits_{\alpha \in A} x_\alpha < \infty$, then I believe we can control the ""tail"" of this series in the sense that $\forall \epsilon >0, \exists$ finite $F \subseteq A$ such that $\sum\limits_{\alpha \in E^C} x_\alpha < \epsilon \ \ \forall E \subseteq A$ with $E \supseteq F$.

$$u=\sqrt[3]{2+\sqrt{5}}+\sqrt[3]{2-\sqrt{5}}$$

$$x^3+3x-4=\left(x-1\right)\left(x^2+x+4\right)$$
and the second, quadratic, factor has complex roots $\frac{-1\pm i\sqrt{15}}{2}$. Can I claim that the minimal polynomial of $u$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $x-1$? In other words: does this prove that $\sqrt[3]{2+\sqrt{5}}+\sqrt[3]{2-\sqrt{5}}=1$? In case it does, how can we demonstrate $u=1$ working on the roots in a way different from how I did in the link?

760010,How does a cropping of a 2D matrix/image affect its DCT transform?,"I apologize in advance: since I am not a mathematician, maybe my question is not well defined, but I hope that some of you will still understand my meaning. Given a 2D matrix, or an image of dimensions w1,h1. I preform a DCT 2D transform on the image (DCT = DCT type 2). I get a 2D result matrix. (This matrix has two frequency axes - x,y. I guess that you can define a ""combined"" frequency by multiplying x and y). Now I do a slight cropping of the image. The new dimensions are w2,h2. Slight cropping means that I delete rows and/or columns, but not more than 10% of the original number of rows/columns. w1,w2 are are slightly different, and also h1,h2. Now I preform a DCT 2D transform on the cropped image. I got a new result matrix. I notices that even when I do a very small cropping (even when deleting only one row from the original matrix), the DCT results are MUCH different, compared with the DCT results without the cropping. My question is: is there any simple mathematical way to describe how slight cropping influence the DCT transform? My guess (I am not sure) is that since the dimensions of the cropped matrix are different, there are less frequencies, so maybe there is a frequency shift, but I don't know how to describe this shift Mathematically. I also don't understand why a small shift in frequency makes such a big difference in amplitude.

760423,Is this method to find mean already discovered?,"I am a 10th class student and in our syllabus, we have three methods for finding mean of grouped data: Direct method. Assumed mean method. Step deviation method. Out of these, the Step deviation method is the simplest but still requires a lot of calculations. In the step-deviation method, you have to first find class mark ($x_i$), subtract some number ($a$) from all of them to get $d_i$ and then divide them all by some number ($h$) to get $u_i$, and then use a formula to get mean. After doing some of the excercises, I noticed that in most of the questions, the values of ui were ...,-2,-1,0,1,2,... etc., so I made this method. Suppose this is the data: $$\begin{array}{c|cc}
i & \text{CI} & f_i \\\hline
1 & 1-3 & 1\\
2 & 3-5 & 2\\
3 & 5-7 & 2\\
4 & 7-9 & 1\\
\end{array}$$ Let $m=$ the class number with the largest $f_i$. (It doesn't matter which number you choose but it will be easy in this way). $\qquad\therefore \qquad m=3$. Set $k_i = m-i$.
$$\begin{array}{c|cc|c}
i & \text{CI} & f_i & k_i \\\hline
1 & 1-3 & 1 & 2\\
2 & 3-5 & 2 & 1\\
3 & 5-7 & 2 & 0\\
4 & 7-9 & 1 & -1\\
\end{array}$$ Let Mean of $kf = \bar k$, that is, $\bar k = \frac{\displaystyle \Sigma f_ik_i}{\displaystyle  \Sigma f_i }$
$$\begin{array}{c|cc|c|c}
i & \text{CI} & f_i & k_i&f_ik_i \\\hline
1 & 1-3 & 1 & 2 & 2\\
2 & 3-5 & 2 & 1 & 2\\
3 & 5-7 & 2 & 0 & 0\\
4 & 7-9 & 1 & -1&-1\\\hline
&&\Sigma f_i = 6&&\Sigma f_ik_i=3
\end{array}$$$$\therefore\qquad\bar k=\frac12$$ Use this formula which I discovered:
$$\bar x = -h\bar k+l+hm-\frac h2$$
(where $h$ is class size and $l$ is lower limit of the first class)
$$\therefore\qquad\bar x = -2\times\frac12+1+2\times 3-\frac22=5$$ Which is the correct answer. Now the question is Has this method been dicovered earlier? What do we call it? If it has been dicovered earlier, then why do they still teach us so complicated methods in school? (As we all know, math is ungooglable.)",['statistics']

Users drag three sliders to emphasize or deemphasize the importance of the variables: I've standardized the variables through the usual means so that each value is the number of standard deviations from the mean.

One user might give $50\%$ weight to graduation rate and $25\%$ to the other two; another might give $33\%$ to all three, and so forth. My first instinct was to just multiply the weight by the standardized value and add them together for each school's score. But this seems to overly reward outliers in one area, when the goal is to surface schools that perform well over all. Graduation rate is negatively correlated with accessibility and positively correlated to cost, FWIW. Is there an accepted way to weight multivariate systems like this in a better way?","['statistics', 'standard-deviation']"

760988,Distribution of ratio of uniform and exponential random variables,"This is a homework question, I feel like I'm doing it right, but I can't seem to get the answer to match up.  I have a uniform RV from 2 to 4, and an exponential with mean 4, so $X \sim \text{UNI}(2,4)$, $Y \sim \text{EXP}(4)$. I'm looking for the density of $U=\dfrac{Y}{X}$.  So $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{2}$, $f(y)=\dfrac{e^{-y/4}}{4}$, and $f(x,y)=\dfrac{e^{-y/4}}{8}$. Now if I substitute $Y=Ux$, and multiply in a Jacobian ($\dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}u}ux=x$, this might be a mistake, I'm not completely clear on this), I can get $f(x,u)=\dfrac{xe^{-xu/4}}{8}$.  The marginal density $f(u)$ is found then by integrating out the $x$, which I can do by turning that joint density into a gamma function, where I need to get a $\dfrac{16}{u^2}$ on the bottom, so I end up with $\dfrac{2}{u^2}$ outside of the gamma integral, and after the gamma integrates to 1, f(u)=$\dfrac{2}{u^2}$.  Anyone see a mistake here?","['statistics', 'ratio', 'uniform-distribution']"
760991,Image of the Brauer group under a field extension,"For $k$ a field, let $Br(k)$ - the Brauer group of $k$ - denote the group of finite-dimensional central simple algebras over $k$, modulo Morita equivalence $(A\equiv B\iff \exists m, n(A\otimes_k M_n(k)\cong B\otimes_k M_m(k))$, with the group operation given by the tensor product $\otimes_k$. Given a Galois field extension $k\subset K$, we get a natural map $Br(k)\rightarrow Br(K)$. The kernel of this map, $Br(K\vert k)$, is just the subgroup of $Br(k)$ of algebras which split over $K$; this is a pretty snappy description. My question is: Is there an equally snappy description of the image of $Br(k)$ in $Br(K)$? (I'm asking this here, as opposed to MO, since I suspect the answer is pretty simple and I just haven't run across it.)

761001,Notation for Partial Functions,"Suppose we have sets $f$, $A$ and $B$ such that $f\subset A\times B$ and $\forall x\in A\space \forall y,z\in B: [(x,y)\in f \land (x,z)\in f \implies y=z]$ i.e. $f$ is a partial function mapping $A$ to $B$. Question: Can we then justify defining $\forall x\in A:\forall y \in B:[ f(x)=y\iff (x,y)\in f]$ allowing us to make all the substitutions entailed by equality? Edit 1: Or, alternatively, without equality... $\forall x\in A: [f(x)\in B \iff \exists y:[y\in B \land (x,y)\in f]]$? Edit 2: The latter definition can be derived from the former. Not sure the other way, so they may not be equivalent . Follow-up (One year later) I have found that the following construct works well for a partial function $f$ of one variable mapping part of set $A$ to set $B$ where the subset $D\subset X$ is the domain of definition: $\forall x:[x\in D \implies f(x)\in B]$ For a partial function $f$ of two variables mapping part of set $A\times B$ to set $C$ where the subset $D\subset A\times B$ is the domain of definition: $\forall x,y: [(x,y)\in D\implies f(x,y)\in C]$ Example Suppose, for some reason, you want to define exponentiation on $\mathbb{N}$, leaving $0^0$ undefined. Let $D=\mathbb{N}^2 - (0,0)$. Then we can define exponentiation as follows $\forall x,y:[(x,y)\in D \implies x^y \in \mathbb{N}]$ $\forall x,y:[(x,y) \in D\implies x^0=1]$ $0^1=0$ $\forall x,y:[(x,y)\in D\implies x^{y+1}=x^y\cdot x]$ Or equivalently... $\forall x,y:[x\in \mathbb{N} \land y\in \mathbb{N} \land \neg [x=0 \land y=0] \implies x^y\in \mathbb{N}]$ $\forall x:[x\in \mathbb{N} \land x\ne 0] \implies x^0=1]$ $0^1=0$ $\forall x,y:[x\in \mathbb{N} \land y\in \mathbb{N} \land \neg [x=0 \land y=0] \implies x^{y+1}=x^y\cdot x]$","['functions', 'definition']"

Trying to get this to a form that resembles the definition I get to: $$f_1(f_2(n)) = k_1 * g_1(g_2(n))$$ and I'm kind of stuck... I don't see how the big-O definition inequality holds.

761040,"Prove that if $W_1\subseteq V$ finite-dimensional, then there is $W_2\subseteq V$ such that $V=W_1\oplus W_2$","Prove that if $W_1$ is any subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, then there exists a subspace $W_2$ of $V$ such that $V = W_1 \oplus W_2$ What I have done so far is to note that since $V$ is finite and $W_1$ is a subspace of $V$, we have $\dim(W_1) \leq \dim(V)$. If we have equality, then let $W_2 = \{0\}$, so that we have $V= W_1 \oplus W_2$.
So now I need to look at the case when $\dim(W_1) \lt \dim(V)$. What I have tried for this case is to let $$\beta = \{v_1,v_2,..,v_n\}$$ be a basis for $V$ and $$\gamma=\{u_1,u_2,..,u_m\}$$ a basis for $W_1$. My idea was to extend $\gamma$ to a basis for $V$, so let $$\alpha=\{u_1,u_2,..,u_m,w_1,w_2,..,w_{n-m}\}$$ be the extension of $\gamma$ to $V$, where $w_1,w_2,..,w_{n-m}$ are basis vectors for $W_2$. If I'm doing this right then I would just have to show that $W_1 \cap W_2 = \{0\}$ and $W_1 + W_2= V$ Am I heading in the right direction? Any hints would be greatly appreciated.","['direct-sum', 'linear-algebra']"
