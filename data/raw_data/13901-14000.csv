Also, it seems $d_k$ and $r_k$ are assumed to be the same thing, I explain that as first direction $p_0$ is the same as the residual $r_0$ and from there we always calculate the next orthogonal direction, so $d_k$ and $r_k$ remain equal.

$$X'(t) = -a X(t) + a X(t - d)$$
where $d$ and $a$ are positive constants. I'm interested in the possible steady-state (stationary) solutions of this and other similar equations as $t\to\infty$. The steady-state seems to vary depending on the initial conditions, for example, I am interested in the case with initial data given by $X(t) = 0$ for $t \in [-d, 0)$ and $X(0) = 1$. Numerical integration with Matlab's dde23 routine gives the steady-state in the case at around $0.33$. My question is whether there is another way (other than numerical integration for a long time period) to find such steady-states analogous to finding fixed points of ODEs. If you try and do that here, by assuming that the terms $X(t)$ and $X(t - d)$ become equal as $t\to\infty$, and that $X'(t) = 0$, you get the useless relation:
$$0 = -a X^* + a X^*$$

The standard proof of this uses the following: $p$ is a prime implies $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$ iff $x^2-py^2=-1$ has integer solutions. $p$ is a prime implies $x^2-py^2=-1$ has integer solutions iff $l(\sqrt{p})$ is odd.

110088,Random graph probability lemma,"I'm trying to prove a fiddly lemma for homework, but getting absolutely nowhere with it. Here, $G_{n,p}$ and $G_{n,m}$ represent, respectively, random graphs on $n$ vertices where the number of edges is binomially distributed with probability $p$ (i.e. any edge in the graph is present with probability $p$ and $N = {n \choose 2}$ possible edges, mean $Np$), and random graphs on $n$ vertices uniformly distributed across all possible such graphs with $m$ edges. We say $G_{n,p}$ has a property $Q = (Q_n)$ 'WHP' (with high probability) if $\mathbb{P}_{n,p}(Q_n) \to 1$ as $n \to \infty$ (similarly for $G_{n,m}$) - for example, this might be that the graph is connected, or is a forest. Now, the lemma I want to prove is as follows: Let $(Q_n)$ be a property of graphs. Then $G_{n,p}$ has $Q$ WHP iff for every $x > 0$ and $\epsilon > 0$ we have (as $n \to \infty$): $$\#\{m: |m-pN| \leq xn\sqrt{pq} \text{ and } \mathbb{P}_{n, m}(Q_n) < 1 - \epsilon\} < \epsilon n \sqrt{pq}$$ Now I've spent a very long time trying to chisel away at thie ""lemma"" but sadly I'm having no luck. In the $\Rightarrow$ direction, we have to translate from some condition in $G_{n,p}$ to one in $G_{n,m}$; the latter condition is, conceptually, on showing that the number of $m$ ""close to the mean"" which have a low $\mathbb{P}(Q_n)$ is small. One thought I had was to try and convert from our binomial distribution to its normal approximation and then use that (since of course $n\sqrt{pq}$ is a close approximation to the standard deviation), but again no progress. It was suggested that it might help to observe that if $\omega (n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ then WHP, $$|e(G_{n,p}) - pN| \leq \omega(n)n\sqrt{pq}\;,$$ but I couldn't complete the proof - nothing has worked so far.

110201,How do I eliminate useless subsets?,"BACKGROUND / MOTIVATION: The other day, I was given a finite covering $\mathcal{B} = \{I_1, \ldots, I_n\}$ of $[0, 1]$ by open intervals, and I wanted to refine it by eliminating useless intervals, that is, those $I_k$ which are contained in the union of the others:
$$I_k \subseteq I_1 \cup \dots \cup \widehat{I_k} \cup \dots \cup I_n~~(\text{$I_k$ is ommited.)}$$
Since my covering was finite, it was easy to establish an algorithm for doing this: check if $I_1$ is useless; if it is, remove it from the list and proceed to $I_2$, considering the new list now, and so on. However, I couldn't help but notice that this process depends on the given order. For example, if $I_1 = [0, 1]$, $I_2 = [0, 3/4)$ and $I_3 = (1/4, 1]$, I would eliminate just $I_1$ and I'd be done. If, on the other hand, $I_3$ and $I_1$ switched places, my algorithm would end up eliminating $I_2$ and $I_3$ instead. I then started wondering whether there is a more direct, non-algorithmic argument to show that such a refinement always exists. A naive guess would be to define
$$\mathcal{B}^{\prime} = \bigg\{ I_k \in \mathcal{B} : I_k \not\subseteq \bigcup_{j \neq k} I_j \bigg\},$$
but this may be empty. In the finite case, one could settle for the given algorithm, but the situation becomes troublesome when dealing with arbitrary coverings. This has lead me to the following question. QUESTION: Suppose you have a set $X$ and an arbitrary family of subsets $\mathcal{A} = \{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ of $X$ such that their union is $X$. How can you prove that there exists a refinement $\mathcal{A}^{\prime} = \{A_j\}_{j \in J}$, $J \subseteq I$, such that no member of $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$ is useless (contained in some union of other members of $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$) but $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$ still covers $X$?

110206,How to show that the push forward of a sigma algebra is a sigma algebra.,"Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a sigma algebra on $X$. Let $f:X\to Y$.

 Then $f^{-1}(\cup B_k)=\cup f^{-1}(B_k)\in \mathcal{M}$. So $\cup B_k \subset Y$ and hence $\cup B_k\in\mathcal{A}$. Also, $f^{-1}(B^c)=(f^{-1}(B))^c\in \mathcal{M}$ and so $B^c\in \mathcal{A}$.

The first uses the formulation of $\operatorname{rad}A$ as the set of $a\in A$ such that $1-ab$ is invertible for all $b\in A$, and the second treats an algebra as a module over itself, and uses the fact that the radical of $A$ as a module agrees with the radical of $A$ as an algebra, and is the intersection of kernels of maps onto simple modules; here the surjectivity is needed to make $B$ into an $A$-module in such a way that the radical of $B$ as an $A$-module is contained in the radical of $B$ as a $B$-module. If a counter example exists, $A$ will have to be infinite-dimensional, as in the finite dimensional case all elements of $\operatorname{rad}A$ are nilpotent, and (I think, although I don't remember a proof right now, so maybe I'm wrong) that the radical always contains every nilpotent element.

In our topology course we learned that in a compact space, every net has a convergent subnet. Now a sequence is of course also a net, so it has to have a convergent subnet. But generally a subnet of a sequence need not be a sequence; but could it still be possible in compact space to choose as subnet of a sequence another sequence? It is of course important that this space should not be first countable, because if it were we wouldn't have to deal with the cumbersome nets.

In some sense, this is a follow-up to my answer to this question where the non-isomorphism between the spaces $L^r$ and $\ell^s$ for $1 \leq r,s \lt \infty$, unless $r$ and $s$ are both two was discussed (among other things). There is the somewhat surprising fact that the Banach spaces $X = L^\infty[0,1]$ and $Y = \ell^\infty$ are
isomorphic. More precisely, there are mutually inverse bounded linear
maps $T:  X \to Y$ and $S: Y \to X$ (see below for a proof of
existence). Is there a direct and explicit way to prove this? In other words: I'm wondering
    whether there is an explicit and natural expression for either $S$ or $T$. Here's the argument I know: Using Pełczyński's decomposition technique one can prove that
$X = L^\infty$ and $Y = \ell^\infty$ are isomorphic as Banach spaces: Choose a countable partition $[0,1] = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty E_n$
into disjoint sets of positive measure and send $(x_n)_{n \in
\mathbb{N}} \in \ell^\infty$ to $\sum_{n=0}^\infty x_n [E_n]$ to get
an isometric embedding $i: Y \hookrightarrow X$. Since $\ell^\infty$
is injective, its image is complemented, in particular, this yields a
decomposition $X \cong Y \oplus \widetilde{Y}$. Choose a dense sequence $(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of the unit sphere of $L^1[0,1]$. For
$h \in L^\infty[0,1]$ let $j(h) = \left( \int f_n \, h \right)_{n \in
\mathbb{N}} \in \ell^\infty$ to get an isometric map $j: L^\infty[0,1] \to
\ell^\infty$. Since $L^\infty[0,1]$ is injective, its image is
complemented in $\ell^\infty$, so this yields a
decomposition $Y \cong X \oplus \widetilde{X}$. Observe that $X \cong X \oplus X$ since $L^\infty[0,1] =
L^\infty[0,1/2] \oplus L^\infty[1/2,1] \cong L^\infty [0,1] \oplus
L^\infty [0,1]$ and $Y \cong Y \oplus Y$ by decomposing $\mathbb{N}$
into the sets of even and odd numbers. Thus, Pełczyński's argument yields:
$$X \cong Y \oplus \widetilde{Y} \cong (Y \oplus Y) \oplus
\widetilde{Y} \cong Y \oplus (Y \oplus \widetilde{Y}) \cong Y \oplus
X$$
and 
$$Y \cong X \oplus \widetilde{X} \cong (X \oplus X) \oplus
\widetilde{X} \cong X \oplus (X \oplus \widetilde{X}) \cong X \oplus
Y$$
so that $X \cong Y \oplus X \cong X \oplus Y \cong Y$. Of course, one can trace through this argument and “construct” an  isomorphism, but the resulting maps are rather messier than what I'm looking for. A further deficit of this argument is that the appeal to injectivity properties makes this inherently non-constructive.

Show $f$ is continuous if and only if $f$ is both upper and lower semi-continuous, using the definition of continuity and semi-continuity based on open set. It's difficult for me to be rigourous here. For example for necessity.
Let $O=\{f(x) : f(x) > a, x \in \mathbb{R}\}$ with $a$ real. By continuity, if $O$ is open then the pre-image of $O$ is open whence $f$ is lower semi-continuous. Is $O$ open? If so why? This point blocks me. I think I can do sufficiency correctly though.
Suppose $f$ is both upper and lower semi-continuous. Let $O$ be an open set. 
Since any open set in $\mathbb{R}$ can be expressed as a union of open sets of the form $(a,b)$, then
$O=\cup (a_n,b_n)$ for some open sets $(a_n,b_n)$. Since each $(a_n,b_n)$ can be written has $(a_n,\infty) \cap (-\infty,b_n)$, by semi-continuity, the pre-image of each $(a_n,b_n)$ is open.
Since $f^{-1}(O)=f^{-1}(\cup(a_n,b_n))=\cup f^{-1}(a_n,b_n)$, then the pre-image of $O$ is open anf $f$ is continuous. Definition:

Although I don't mind direct solutions from tables and other sources, I prefer an elaborated answer. Here's the solution in terms of $\psi(x)$. By separating even and odd indices we can get $$\eqalign{

  & \frac{1}{2}\psi \left( {1 - \frac{a}{2}} \right) - \frac{1}{2}\psi \left( {\frac{a}{2}} \right) = \frac{\pi }{2}\cot \frac{{\pi a}}{2}  \cr 
  & \frac{1}{2}\psi \left( {1 - \frac{{a + 1}}{2}} \right) - \frac{1}{2}\psi \left( {\frac{{a + 1}}{2}} \right) = \frac{\pi }{2}\cot \frac{{\pi \left( {a + 1} \right)}}{2} =  - \frac{\pi }{2}\tan \frac{{\pi a}}{2} \cr} $$ So the series become $$\eqalign{
  & \sum\limits_{k =  - \infty }^\infty  {\frac{{{{\left( { - 1} \right)}^k}}}{{a + k}}}  = \frac{\pi }{2}\left\{ {\cot \frac{{\pi a}}{2} + \tan \frac{{\pi a}}{2}} \right\}  \cr 
  & \sum\limits_{k =  - \infty }^\infty  {\frac{{{{\left( { - 1} \right)}^k}}}{{a + k}}}  = \pi \csc \pi a \cr} $$ The last being an application of a trigonometric identity.","['special-functions', 'sequences-and-series', 'trigonometry', 'calculus']"

110499,$C$ is irreducible iff $C=\mathscr{Z}(\mathfrak{p})$ for some prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$?,"Let $A$ be a commutative Noetherian ring, and $C$ a closed subset of $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$. In some reading, it is an unproven proposition that $C$ is irreducible iff $C=\mathscr{Z}(\mathfrak{p})$ for some prime $\mathfrak{p}$. Here $\mathscr{Z}(\frak{p})$ is the set of zeros of $\frak{p}$, that is the set of primes of $A$ containing $\frak{p}$. Does anyone have a proof of this proposition I can read? Thank you. Added: With hints, If $\mathfrak{p}\in V(\mathfrak{a})$, then $\frak{p}\supset\frak{a}$, so $xy\in\mathfrak{p}$, so say $x\in\mathfrak{p}$. Then $\mathfrak{p}\supset(\mathfrak{a},x)$, and $V(\mathfrak{a})\subseteq V(\mathfrak a, x) \cup V(\mathfrak a, y)$. The converse is clear, so I understand the equality. Since $V(\mathfrak{a})$ is irreducible, $V(\mathfrak{a})=V(\mathfrak{a},x)$ or $V(\mathfrak{a},y)$. Suppose $V(\mathfrak{a})=V(\mathfrak{a},x)$. Then $\text{rad}\mathfrak{a}\supset\text{rad}(\mathfrak{a},x)$, so $x\in\text{rad}\mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{a}$, and $\mathfrak{a}$ is prime. But why are we allowed to assume $\mathfrak{a}$ is radical? For the converse, $\mathfrak{p}$ must be in either $V(\mathfrak{a})$ or $V(\mathfrak{b})$ so $\mathfrak{p}$ must contain either $\mathfrak{a}$ or $\mathfrak{b}$. IF $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ are radical, then this relation implies $\text{rad}\mathfrak{p}\subset\mathfrak{a}$ and $\text{rad}\mathfrak{p}\subset\mathfrak{b}$, so $\mathfrak{a}\supset\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{b}\supset\mathfrak{p}$ since $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime. Thus $\mathfrak{p}$ is equal to one of $\mathfrak{a}$ or $\mathfrak{b}$.

110501,Can we extend the definition of a continuous function to binary relations?,"Let $X,Y$ be topological spaces. A function $\phi:X\to Y$ is continuous iff for any open subset $A\subseteq Y,$ the preimage $\phi^{-1}(A)$ is open in $X.$ We could similarly define a relation $\rho\subseteq X\times Y$ to be continuous iff $\rho^{-1}(A)$ is open in $X$ for any open subset $A\subseteq Y$. It can be easily seen that the composition of such relations again satisfies the condition and that the identity relation does. I had my first lecture in category theory  this week so I know this gives us a category with topological spaces as objects and relations as morphisms. This is a good thing, I imagine. For example, let's take $\rho=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb R\times \mathbb R\,|\,x^2+y^2=1\}.$ Clearly, for any open interval $(a,b)\subseteq \mathbb R,$ we have $\rho^{-1}((a,b))$ open in $\mathbb R$, and since open intervals form a basis in $\mathbb R$, this is true for any open subset $A\subseteq \mathbb R.$ So a relation that ""looks continuous"" is continuous in the sense defined in the previous paragraph. However, this is hardly evidence for the notion being useful. Therefore, I would like to ask whether it makes any sense to consider such relations and whether they have been considered. I have googled ""continuous binary relations"" but the hits seem to be irrelevant (but perhaps the terminology has been too cryptic for me to understand they're not).

110503,Calculating the percentage difference of two numbers,"The basic problem is this: ""I have this number x and I ask you to give me another number y. If the number you give me is some percentage c different than my number then I do not want it."" Given that you will know x and c, how do you calculate whether or not I should take y? The naive approach I came up with is to just divide y / x < c but this fails for obvious reason (try y bigger than x). The next approach I is that the percentage difference is really just a ratio of the smaller number divided by the larger number. So thereforce we could try min(x, y) / max(x, y) < c. However this does not work, here is an example: x = 1.2129 y = 1.81935 c = 50% If we do the above we get 1.2129 / 1.81935 = 0.67 which is greater than 0.50. The problem here is that I obtained y by multiplying 1.2129 by 1.5, therefore y is only 50% greater than x. Why? I still don't understand why the above formula doesn't work. Eventually through some googling I stumbled accross the percentage difference formula but even this doesn't suit my needs. It is abs(x - y) / ((x + y) / 2). However, this does not yield the result I am looking for. abs(x - y) = abs(1.2129 - 1.81935 ) = 0.60645. (x + y) / 2 = 3.03225 / 2 = 1.516125 0.60645 / 1.516125 = 0.4 Eventually I ended up writing some code to evaluate x * c < y < x * (1 + c). As the basic idea is that we don't want any y that is 50% less than my number, nor do we want any number that is 50% greater than my number. Could someone please help me identify what I'm missing here? It seems like there ought to be another way that you can calculate the percentage difference of two arbitrary numbers and then compare it to c.",['algebra-precalculus']

The correspondence $\eta \leftrightarrow \chi(\eta\xi)$ is an isomorphism, both topological and algebraic, between $k^{+}$ and its character group. The proof of this lemma is divided up into 6 steps, one step is to show that the characters $\chi(\eta\xi)$ are everywhere dense in the character group. Tate writes $\chi(\eta\xi) = 1$, all $\eta \implies k^{+}\xi \neq k^{+} \implies \xi = 0$. Therefore the characters of the form $\chi(\eta\xi)$ are everywhere dense in the character group.

110576,Is $C^{\infty}$-related an equivalence relation?,"I am working on the ""A comprehensive introduction to differential geometry"" by Michael Spivak. I have a question about an exercise in chap 2, on differential structures. Let $M$ be a manifold, and $U$ and $V$ be open subsets of $M$. The functions $x:U\rightarrow x(U)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ and $y:V\rightarrow y(V)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ are co-ordinate mappings on $M$. Spivak then says two such maps are $C^{\infty}$-related if: $y\circ x^{-1}:x(U\cap V)\rightarrow y(U\cap V)$ $x\circ y^{-1}:y(U\cap V)\rightarrow x(U\cap V)$ are both $C^{\infty}$ An exercise asks to show that this is not an equivalence relation. I can't see what is wrong with my reasoning, which seems to show that it is an equivalence relation. Here is my proof: To check it is an equivalence relation we need to prove the 3 properties: Reflexivity, Symmetry, Transitivity. The relation is: $x\sim y$ if $x$ and $y$ are $C^{\infty}$-related Reflexivity: $x\circ x^{-1} = Id$ which is a $C^{\infty}$ map. Symmetry: If $x\sim y$ then $y\sim x$ since the $C^{\infty}$-related condition is symmetric. Transitivity: If $x\sim y$ and $y\sim z$ then $x\circ y^{-1}$ and $y\circ z^{-1}$ are both $C^{\infty}$, so $(x\circ y^{-1})\circ (y\circ z^{-1})=x\circ z^{-1}$ is $C^{\infty}$. Similarly, $y\circ x^{-1}$ and $z\circ y^{-1}$ are both $C^{\infty}$, so $(z\circ y^{-1})\circ (y\circ x^{-1})=z\circ x^{-1}$ is $C^{\infty}$. So the transitive condition also holds.

Any help would be much appreciated. Here is where i got stuck i was hoping for a direct proof starting with the LHS of $\sum \cos p\theta = 0$. Solution attempt Well as we know the number of primitive roots(roots the power of which give all the roots) is the number of integers(including unity) less than n and prime to it. Hence we get this number from Euler's totient or phi function. In the first part of the problem we are asked to assume $0 < p < \dfrac {n} {abc\ldots k}$.

Also, because I want to have $4$ of such occurrence, it would be $\frac{1}{6}^4$. So, I could just calculate $P(X=4)=\binom{10}{4}\frac { 1 }{ 6 }^4 =0.027006173\approx 2.7\%$. But, suppose if I use the Binomial Distribution formula, it would be a little different because it needs to multiply the ""not-happening"" probability to it. The Binomial Distribution looks like this: $$P(X=x)=\binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$ So if I plug in my values, it would be:
$$
P(X=4)=\binom{10}{4}(\frac{1}{6})^4(\frac{5}{6})^{6}=0.054=5.4\%
$$ Here, $2.1\%$ is lesser than $5.4\%$. What's the difference between the two values? Which is the correct value? Intuitively, I find the Binomial Distribution may be more accurate since it dictates the situation to consider both the happening and not-happening outcomes. But usually, I thought we just multiply the probabilities of what we want it to happen as long as the events are independent. So the first method sounds quite okay too. Eg: What's the probability to get 2 heads out of 5 flips of a fair coin, I just use $\frac { 1}{ 2} \times \frac { 1}{ 2} $. The not-happening probabilities are not cared of.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"
110669,Simple algebra. How can you factor out a common factor if it is $\frac{1}{\text{factor}}$ in one of the cases?,"I'm sure this is simple.  I want to pull out a factor as follows... I have the expression $$\frac{a(\sqrt{x}) - (b + c)(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}})c}{x}.$$ It would be useful for me to pull out the $\sqrt{x}$ from the numerator and try to simplify to remove the denominator, but how can I pull out the $\sqrt{x}$ from the right-most statement $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$.

110673,System of three linear ODEs by elimination method,"Help me solve a system of three linear ODEs. I seem to have grasped the $2\times 2$ systems but $3\times 3$ ones give me problems. I solved one $3\times 3$ using the method of elimination. I'm postponing the matrix method for a while. Here's the system:
$$
x' = 3x + y - z
$$
$$
y' = x + 2y - z
$$
$$
z' = 3x + 3y -z
$$ What I do is I turn it into operator notation:
$$
(D-3)x - y + z = 0
$$
$$
-x + (D-2)y + z = 0
$$
$$
-3x - 3y + (D+1)z = 0
$$
Then into $2\times 2$ system by eliminating $z$ - first two equations to get $$ (D-2)x + (-D+1)y = 0 $$ and then last two to get: $$ -(D-2)x + (D^2-D+1)y = 0 $$
Now, if I eliminate $x$ from the $2\times 2$ system easily by adding them together I get $$ (D^2-2D+2)y = 0 $$ which gives a complex solution $$ r_1 = 1 + i $$ and $$ r_2 = 1 - i $$ which gives as the solution for $y$: $$ y = C_1 \mathrm{e}^t \cos(t) + C_2 \mathrm{e}^t \sin(t) $$
So, only two constants - $C_1$ and $C_2$. But, it should have three constants since this is $3 \times 3$ system. At least, that's how it was in another solution of $3\times 3$ system that I solved. How do I solve this using elimination method?",['ordinary-differential-equations']
110691,Tail bound on the sum of independent (non-identical) geometric random variables,"Suppose $X_1, \ldots , X_k$ are $k$ independent geometric random variables with success probability $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ and let $X = X_1 + \cdots + X_k$. The expected number of trials needed is 
$$
\mathbb E[X] = \frac{1}{p_1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{p_k} \> .
$$ Claim :  It should be true that there is a constant $c>0$ (independent of $k$ and the success probabilities $p_i$) such that for any $t>0$ we have
 $$
\mathbb P[X > c (\mathbb E[X] + t)] < (1 - p_\min)^t \>,
$$ where $p_\min = \min_i p_i$. I would be very thankful for any help in proving this. Note that if $p_1 = \cdots = p_k = p$ then $X$ is a negative binomial random variable. In this case, one can prove the claim with $c=16$ via a standard Chernoff bound: The expected number of successes after $16(\frac{k}{p}+t)$ trials is $16(k+tp)$ and, by the Chernoff bound, the probability that there are less than $k<\frac{1}{2}E[X]$ successes is at most $e^{-16(k+tp)/8}$ which is less than $e^{-2tp} < (1 - p)^t$.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

110731,You throw a fair coin one million times. what is the expected number of strings of 6 heads followed by 6 tails.,"I tried to solve this problem, and I used something similar to the probability of the  Bernoulli distribution to find how many tosses you need to obtain a probability of almost one for one occurrence. Then I just divide the number of tosses in the problem statement by the number of tosses I get. Is there a better way to do this? Edit: What I tried is m = $12$ N = $10^6$ Probability of having X = ""m heads followed by m tails"" is $\frac{1}{2^m}$ Probability of X at exactly at position i is $1/2^m*(1-1/2^m)^i$ Probability of X after p tries is $\sum_{i=0}^{p}1/2^m*(1-1/2^m)^i =1-(1-1/2^m)^{p+1}$ Now when p is big enough the probability is 1.
