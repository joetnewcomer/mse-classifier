18134,Guessing a hidden number on a cube,"You are and your friend are given a list of N distinct integers and are told this: Six distinct integers from the list are selected at random and placed one at each side of a cube. The cube is placed in the middle of a rectangular room in front of its only door, with one face touching the floor, its 6 sides parallel to the walls of the room. Your friend must enter the room and is allowed to alter the orientation of the cube, with the restriction that afterwards its in the same place with one face touching the floor and its 6 sides kept parallel to the walls of the room. Your friend will then be sendt away, after which you can enter the room and are allowed to observe the 5 visible sides of the cube.

18138,"An Intuition to An Inclusion: ""Union of Intersections"" vs ""Intersection of Unions""","Let $E = \{E_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ be an infinite sequence of sets. Then, the following inclusion holds: $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{k=n}^{\infty} E_k \quad\subseteq\quad \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty} E_k$ I know the left-hand side (LHS) represents elements which belong to all but finitely many sets in the sequence $E$, and the right-hand side (RHS) represents elements which belong to infinitely many sets in the sequence $E$. This concludes the proof that the LHS is contained in the RHS. Yet it is not intuitive for me, since the above interpretation is not intuitive per se. Is there an intuitive reason why the above inclusion holds? That is, (very informally) why union of intersections is contained in intersection of unions ?","['intuition', 'sequences-and-series', 'elementary-set-theory']"

I have to take the last statement and transform it so that it is similar to: $|A' ∪ B'|$ But I don't know how transform it; that complementary is problematic. I have tried playing with the complementary, but I get this: $|E ∩ F ∩ M^c| = |(E∪F∪M^c)^c|$ But that is not useful, right?

18179,Finding Value of the Infinite Product $\prod \Bigl(1-\frac{1}{n^{2}}\Bigr)$,"While trying some problems along with my friends we had difficulty in this question. True or False: The value of the infinite product $$\prod\limits_{n=2}^{\infty} \biggl(1-\frac{1}{n^{2}}\biggr)$$ is $1$. I couldn't do it and my friend justified it by saying that since the terms in the product have values less than $1$, so the value of the product can never be $1$. I don't know whether this justification is correct or not. But i referred to Tom Apostol's Mathematical Analysis book and found a theorem which states, that The infinite product $\prod(1-a_{n})$ converges if the series $\sum a_{n}$ converges. This assures that the above product converges. Could anyone help me in finding out where it converges to?

18192,Disjoint compact sets in a Hausdorff space can be separated,"I want to show that any two disjoint compact sets in a Hausdorff space $X$ can be separated by disjoint open sets. Can you please let me know if the following is correct? Not for homework, just studying for a midterm. I'm trying to improve my writing too. My work: Let $C$,$D$ be disjoint compact sets in a Hausdorff space $X$. Now fix $y \in D$ and for each $x \in C$ we can find (using Hausdorffness) disjoint open sets $U_{x}(y)$ and $V_{x}(y)$ such that $x \in U_{x}(y)$ and $y \in V_{x}(y)$. Now the collection $\{U_{x}: x \in C\}$ covers $C$ so by compactness we can find some natural k such that $C \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^{k} U_{x_{i}}(y)$ Now for simplicity let $U = \bigcup_{i=1}^{k} U_{x_{i}}(y)$, then $C \subseteq U$ and let $W(y) = \bigcap_{i=1}^{k} V_{x_{i}}(y)$. Then $W(y)$ is a neighborhood of $y$ and disjoint from $U$. Now consider the collection $\{W(y): y \in D\}$, this covers D so by compactness we can find some natural q such that $D \subseteq \bigcup_{j=1}^{q} W_{y_{j}}$. Finally set $V = \bigcup_{j=1}^{q} W_{y_{j}}$, then $U$ and $V$ are disjoint open sets containing $C$ and $D$ respectively.

18197,Jacobian of a function mapping vectors to vectors,"I believe the problem of trying to find the Jacobian of the following function highlights a lack of understanding of some concept on my part. I was hoping someone could either provide specific advice about solving this problem, or computing Jacobians in general. Consider the mapping $h : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ where the domain is length-$n$ column vectors and the range length-$n$ row vectors (or a transposed vector, if you like). The function is
$$h(x) = \frac{\eta v' + (M x)'}{(\eta + u'x)^2},$$
where the constants $v$ and $u$ are (column) vectors, $\eta$ is a scalar, and $M$ is a square matrix. So far as I know, the quotient rule for vectors is
$$\nabla\left(\frac{f}{g}\right) = \frac{g\nabla f - f \nabla g}{g^2}$$
and
\begin{align*}
\nabla f &= M'\\
\nabla g &= 2(\eta + u'x) u'
\end{align*}
Putting it all together, I get
$$\nabla h = \frac{(\eta + u'x)^2 M' - [\eta v' + (M x)'] 2(\eta + u'x) u'}{(\eta + u'x)^4}.$$
This expression is clearly not right, and to see why evaluate the Jacobian at $x = \mathbf{0}$:
$$\nabla h(0) = \frac{\eta^2 M' - 2\eta^2 v' u'}{\eta^4}$$
The resulting expression should be a $n \times n$ matrix, but in the second term we have two (row) vectors multiplied by one another. It seems likely there should be some sort of outer product here, but I'm not sure where my math is going wrong. Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated.",['multivariable-calculus']

18226,Setting Up an Integral to Find A Cone's Surface Area,"I tried proving the formula presented here by integrating the circumferences of cross-sections of a right circular cone: $$\int_{0}^{h}2\pi sdt, \qquad\qquad s = \frac{r}{h}t$$ so $$\int_{0}^{h}2\pi \frac{r}{h}tdt.$$ Integrating it got me $\pi h r$ , which can't be right because $h$ isn't the slant height. So adding up the areas of differential-width circular strips doesn't add up to the lateral surface area of a cone? EDIT: I now realize that the integral works if I set the upper limit to the slant height - this works if I think of ""unwrapping"" the cone and forming a portion of a circle. The question still remains though: why won't the original integral work? Won't the value of the sum of the cylinders' areas reach the area of the cone as the number of partitions approaches infinity?",['integration']

18254,Ways in which a manifold can be geodesically incomplete,"Naively I would have thought that a manifold becomes geodesically incomplete if there are missing points in it or if the geodesics are hitting a boundary. But I am not sure how to think of geodesic completeness or not for manifolds with a boundary. Like how to think for the closed disk on $\mathbb{R}^2$ I would like to know of other generic ways in which geodesic incompleteness can happen. (Like for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds the Hawking-Penrose theorems pin down many generic scenarios) Like from $\mathbb{R}^2$ (with the standard metric) if one removes the point $(0,0)$ then there is no geodesic from say the point $(-1,0)$ to $(1,0)$. But I can't visualize how I can actually put a complete metric on this punctured plane and make it geodesically complete? I can try to make the metric hyperbolic near the deleted point so that the geodesics approaching it never actually reach it but go off to infinity but even then I can't see how it will produce a geodesic which connects $(-1,0)$ to $(1,0)$ Also there are two other ways of producing geodesic incompleteness which I know but don't have a good understanding of, Any open subset of a complete connected Riemannian manifold is geodesically incomplete. (I guess this follows from Hopf-Rinow but I can't see it clearly) A noncompact surface which is not diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$, and if for some metric every point on this surface has positive curvature, then the metric on it must be incomplete. I would be happy to see explanations about the above things and also examples for the second case. Also is it possible to write down as formulas simple examples of incomplete geodesics?","['general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

It seems like the hint he was given was to start from the contour integral. Starting with the contour integral, I tried using different semi-circles (assuming that $z$ was real), but this quickly turned into something weird. I also tried to use a circle as the contour, then map it to the real line. That was a failure. I tried working backwards, from the integral on the real axis. Didn't have luck.

At each time step $t$, each pebble moves to the slot closest to the halfway point between its neighboring pebbles; if there is a tie, it chooses the slot to the left.  The leftmost and rightmost pebbles apply the same procedure, but imagining that there are slots numbered $0$ and $n+1$ with pebbles in them. Formally, numbering the pebbles 
$1, \ldots, k$ from left to right, and letting $x_i(t)$ be the slot of the $i$'th pebble at time t, we have $$ x_i(t+1) = \lfloor \frac{x_{i-1}(t)+x_{i+1}(t)}{2} \rfloor, i = 2, \ldots, k-1$$ $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ rounds down to the closest integer. Similarly, $$ x_1(t+1) = \lfloor (1/2) x_2(t) \rfloor, x_k(t+1) = \lfloor \frac{x_{k-1}(t) + (n+1)}{2} \rfloor.$$ Now the fixed point of this procedure is the arrangement in which $x_{i+1} - x_i$ and $x_i - x_{i-1}$ differ by $1$.

Let $v_1,\dots,v_n$ be an orthonormal basis, and let $A=(a_{ij})$ be the matrix of $f$ with respect to this basis. The goal here is to prove that the $A$ is symmetric.  I can prove this easily enough by saying: Since $T$ is an inner product, $T(v_i,v_j)=\delta_{ij}$. \begin{align*}
T(A v_j,v_i)&=T(\sum_{k=1}^n a_{kj} v_k,v_i)\\
&=T(a_{1j} v_1,v_i) + \dots + T(a_{nj} v_n,v_i)\\

&=a_{ij}\tag{$T(v_i,v_j)=\delta_{ij}$}\\
\end{align*} By the same logic, \begin{align*}
T(A v_j,v_i)&=T(v_j,A v_i)\\
&=T(v_j,\sum_{k=1}^n a_{ki} v_k)\\
&=T(v_j,a_{1i} v_1)+\dots+T(v_j,a_{ni} v_n)\\

x^T T A y &= (A x)^T T y\\
&=x^T A^T T y\\
TA &= A^T T\\
(TA)^T &= (A^T T)^T\\
A^T T^T &= T^T A\\
TA &= A^T T^T\tag{T is symmetric}\\
&= (TA)^T\tag{transpose of matrix product}\\

Suppose a polygon is described by its feature point and vertices $P=(p,v_1,\ldots,v_n)$, then the characterization function is $C(P)$ such that $C(P)=C(Q)$ if and only if $P$ is congruent* to $Q$. The most important thing I need is that for two polygons which are ""almost"" congruent, their characterization vectors should be ""close"" (like, say, small 2-norm difference). The question then is what is a simple definition of the characterization function $C(\cdot)$ which satisfies my requirements? *Here I define congruent as identical up to rotation and translation (reflections are not allowed), cyclic permutation of vertex indices, as well as identical feature point locations. If $P$ is congruent to $Q$, then any cyclic permutation of the vertices of either polygon should still leave $C(P)=C(Q)$ (thus $C$ should be invariant to cyclic permutations of the vertices). If two polygons are congruent, then when they are overlaid, the feature points of both polygons must also match up (this is why I originally stated that the polygon is defined relative to the feature point). An illustration of what I mean is shown below. The dots inside are the feature points of the surrounding polygon. Things that don't work Most characterizations of polygons usually calculate the 2x2 moment of inertial tensor relative to the center of mass of the polygon.

18530,"A subset of permutations on the set S such that the elements that are within T, a subset of S, are not exchanged with elements outside of T","Sorry about the title, I have no idea how to describe these types of problems. Problem statement: $A(S)$ is the set of 1-1 mappings of $S$ onto itself.  Let $S \supset T$ and consider the subset $U(T) = $ { $f \in A(S)$ | $f(t) \in T$ for every $t \in T$ }.  $S$ has $n$ elements and $T$ has $m$ elements.  Show that there is a mapping $F:U(T) \rightarrow S_m$ such that $F(fg) = F(f)F(g)$ for $f, g \in U(T)$ and $F$ is onto $S_m$. How do I write up this reasoning:  When I look at the sets $S$ = { 1, 2, ..., $n$} and $T$ = { 1, 2, ..., $m$}, I can see that there are a bunch of permutations of the elements of $T$ within $S$.  I can see there are $(n - m)!$ members of $S$ for each permutation of $T$'s elements.  But there needs to be some way to get a handle on the positions of the elements in $S$ and $T$ in order to compare them to each other.  But $S$ isn't any particular set, like a set of integers, so how can I relate the positions of the elements to one another?  Or, is this the wrong way to go about it?

18582,Notation for a polynomial ring and formal polynomials,"Given that we shouldn't say that ""$f(z)$ is a function"", shouldn't we also not write ""$p \in k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ is a polynomial""? Along those lines, I usually write $p(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \in k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ in order to balance the ""free variables"" on both sides of the relation, but that gets unwieldy when you start dealing with iterated polynomial rings. My question is: Is there a notation for polynomial rings which allow us to talk about polynomials without explicitly naming the indeterminates? Consider, for an analogy, vector spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$. These have a canonical basis, but the notation $\mathbb{R}^n$ does not commit me to naming the canonical basis, unlike, say, the notation $\operatorname{span} \{ e_1, \ldots, e_n \}$. I suppose I should fix a definition for polynomial rings. For simplicity let's work in the category $\mathbf{CRing}$ of commutative rings with 1. Let $U: \mathbf{CRing} \to \mathbf{Set}$ be the forgetful functor taking rings to their underlying sets. A polynomial ring in a set of indeterminates $\mathcal{S}$ over a ring $A$ is a ring $R$ together with an inclusion map $\iota: A \hookrightarrow R$ and a set-map $x: \mathcal{S} \hookrightarrow UR$, and has the universal property that for every ring $B$, homomorphism $\phi: A \to B$, and set-map $b: \mathcal{S} \to B$, there is a homomorphism $\epsilon: R \to B$ such that $\epsilon \circ \iota = \phi$ and $U\epsilon \circ x = b$. If we write $A[\mathcal{S}]$ for such a ring $R$, then we could write, for instance, $A[5]$ for the ring of polynomials in 5 variables over $A$, but that would, I imagine, be extremely confusing. Yet, on the other hand, if we have a bijection $\mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}'$, then this lifts to an isomorphism of $A[\mathcal{S}] \to A[\mathcal{S}']$, so it is all the more tempting to write $A[\kappa]$, $\kappa = |\mathcal{S}|$, for the canonical representative of this isomorphism class. If $\mathcal{S} = \{ 1, \ldots, n \} \subset \mathbb{N}$ and $\phi: A \to B$ is given, I write $\phi p(b_1, \ldots, b_n)$ for the image of $p \in A[\mathcal{S}]$ under $\epsilon$ for $b(m) = b_m, m \in \mathcal{S}$. When the choice of homomorphism $\phi$ is clear I'll omit it in writing. This justifies my notation $p(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \in A[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$, since I would like to regard $A[X]$ as being analogous to $\mathbb{Z}[\pi]$, i.e. it's a ring with a transcendental element adjoined so is isomorphic to a polynomial ring, but doesn't come with evaluation maps attached. But following this line of thought, how should I denote the object that $p$ itself belongs to? I recently started attending an algebraic geometry course and at one point the lecturer wrote $k[\mathbb{A}^n]$ for the ring of polynomials in $n$ indeterminates over $k$. This seems like a reasonable solution, but there are some problems: It feels suspiciously like a function ring, but in general the map taking formal polynomials to polynomial functions is neither injective nor surjective. The notation makes it look like a ring with $\mathbb{A}^n$ adjoined, but that doesn't seem to make sense. (Is there a way to make sense of it, e.g. by defining ring operations on $\mathbb{A}^n$?) Is it standard notation? I have seen $k[V]$ in some algebraic geometry textbooks for the coordinate ring of the (affine) variety $V$, but never for $V = \mathbb{A}^n$. (I have similar reservations about the notation $k[V]$, but not as strongly.) Would it make sense to write, say, $\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{A}^n]$? A related problem arises from the following: let $p(X)$ and $q(X)$ be formal polynomials in $k[X]$, with $p(X) = q(X^2)$. It's clear that $\operatorname{deg} p = 2 \operatorname{deg} q$... but this shows that, in a certain sense, the degree depends on the ambient polynomial ring: if $p(X)$ were considered as a formal polynomial in $k[X^2]$, its degree would be the same as $q$, since, after all, $p(X) = q(X^2)$. It is clear that we should have $k[X^2] \subset k[X]$, but if we obviate the indeterminates and reduce polynomials to their bare skeletons, then the ""inclusion"" map $k[X^2] \hookrightarrow k[X]$ is no longer a set-theoretic inclusion map. Is there a coherent way of thinking about polynomials and polynomial rings which resolves this ambiguity, and what is the notation that goes with it?","['notation', 'commutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

18614,"Nonpositive curvature, Theorem of Cartan-Hadamard","In my differential geometry course we had the following Theorem (Cartan-Hadamard) : Let $M$ be a connected, simply connected, complete Riemannian manifold. Then the following are equivalent: $M$ has nonpositive curvature $|d\exp_p(v)\hat v| \ge |\hat v|$ for all $p \in M$, $v, \hat v \in T_pM$ $d(\exp_p(v), \exp_p(w)) \ge |v - w|$ for all $p \in M$, $v, w \in T_pM$ In addition $\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism if either of these statements holds. Now, I understand the proof that was given, but I do not see where we have to use simple connectivity of $M$ (in the proof given by my professor the Cartan-Ambrose-Hicks Theorem was used). What's wrong with the following: $1. \Leftrightarrow 2.$ didn't make use of simple connectivity. (at least I don't see where) But now I think 2., completeness and connectedness imply that $\exp_p$ is a diffeo, and in particular $M$ is simply connected. _ 2. implies 3.: Let $v, w \in T_pM$ be given, let $\gamma(t) = \exp_p(v(t))$ be a lenght minimizing geodesic connecting $\exp_p(v)$ and $\exp_p(w)$. Then $
\begin{eqnarray}
 d(\exp_p(v), \exp_p(w)) &=& L(\gamma) \\ &=& \int_0^1 |\dot \gamma(t)| \, dt \\ &\ge&  \int_0^1 |\dot v(t)| \, dt \\ &\ge&  \left| \int_0^1 \dot v(t) \, dt \right| \\ &=& |v-w|
\end{eqnarray}
$ Therefore $\exp_p$ is injective. 
Completeness and connectedness imply that $\exp_p$ is surjective (Hopf-Rinow).
2 implies that $\exp_p$ is a local diffeo. So in conclusion $\exp_p$ is seen to be a bijective local diffeo, hence a diffeo. My question: Is there anything wrong with this argument?

Show that if a manifold $M$ is contractible, then every vector bundle over $M$ is equivalent to the trivial bundle. Got this as homework but I'm kind of lost in the hole vector bundle subject, so if anyone could give some hints to this one as well as to understanding the subject, it would be highly appreciated .","['general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
18776,Mean distance between a fixed point and a gaussian distributed random variable,"In 2D or 3D I have a fix point y and Gaussian distribution of a random point x. I am now interested in the mean euclidean distance between x and y: $E_x [ d(x,y) ] = \int _{-\infty }^{\infty } d(x,y) N(x; \mu, \Lambda )dx$ Many thanks in advance",['probability']
18778,Convergence of Sets? (Topology on a Powerset of a Set?),"Given a sequence of sets, is there some well-defined notion of a limit of a set? In other words, given some universe set $U$, I am wondering if there is a topology on $2^U$ (the powerset of $U$) such that the usual intersection and the union limits converge in that topology. As an explicit example, let $U=\mathbb{N}$, 
$S_n = \{x\in \mathbb{N} | n< x \le 2n \}$, 
 $T_n = \{n\}$. The limit of both sequences above should be the empty set by the following argument: \begin{align}
S_n &\subset (n,\infty) \\\\
\lim_{n\to\infty} S_n &\subset \lim_{n\to\infty} (n,\infty) = \cap_{n\in\mathbb{N}} (n,\infty) = \emptyset 
\end{align} (I'm not sure how to justify passing a set inclusion to the limit.)","['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory']"
18779,Maurer-Cartan 1- form as a connection 1-form,"I'm trying to decipher a differential geometric comment on page 23-24 of Berline, Getzler, and Vergne's ""Heat Kernels and Dirac Operators"". Take a trivial vector bundle $E \times M$ in a manifold $M$ with connection $\nabla = d + \omega$ where $\omega$ is an $End(E)$-valued 1 form.  Let $g: GL(E) \to End(E)$ be the tautological map sending a linear map in $GL(E)$ to itself as an element of $End(E)$.  The claim is that the connection 1-form on the (trivial) frame bundle for $E \times M$ is given by $g^{-1} \pi^* \omega g + g^{-1} d g$.  In particular, if $\omega = 0$ then we get that the trivial connection on the trivial bundle is the Maurer-Cartan 1-form.  Unfortunately, I don't see how to give a convincing proof of this - can someone help?",['differential-geometry']
18793,Groups that are not amalgams,"It is clear that cyclic groups have the property that they cannot be written in a non-trivial way as an amalgamated free product or as an HNN-extension. Can someone please provide us examples of torsion-free 2-generated groups having this property? Any comments related to this question are welcome! [I'm aware of Serre's Theorem 15 in Trees.] Edit: The term ""in a non-trivial way"" means the following.
For an amalgamated free product $G=H*_C K$ it is required $H\ne C\ne K$. For an HNN-extension $G=HNN(H,A,B,t)$ it is required $A\ne H\ne B$.",['group-theory']
