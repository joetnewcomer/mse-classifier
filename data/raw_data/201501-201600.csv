3961342,"Calculate $\int_0^1 \left\lfloor \frac{2020}{x} \right\rfloor - 2020\left\lfloor\frac1x\right\rfloor\,dx$","Calculate the definite integral $$\int_0^1 \left\lfloor \frac{2020}{x} \right\rfloor - 2020\left\lfloor\frac1x\right\rfloor\,dx$$ My Attempt: Let's make a start. Write $[2020/x]=n\ge 2020$ then ${{2020}\over {n+1}}\le 1/x < {{2020}\over n}$ and ${n\over {2020}}\le 1/x <{{n+1}\over {2020}}$ . Hence $[1/x]=[n/2020]$ . For the integral we find $$\sum_{n=2020}^\infty \int_{2020/(n+1)}^{2020/n} (n-2020[n/2020]) dx=2020\sum_{2020}^\infty {1\over {n(n+1)}} (n-2020[n/2020]) $$ In order to get $[n/2020] = m$ we need $m \leq n/2020 < m+1$ or $2020m \leq n \leq 2020m + 2019$ . Now write: $$2020\sum_{n=2020}^\infty \frac{1}{n(n+1)} (n-2020\lfloor n/2020\rfloor) = 2020\sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=2020m}^{2020m+2019} \frac{1}{n(n+1)} (n-2020m)$$ $$ = 2020\sum_{m=1}^\infty \left[\left(\sum_{n=2020m}^{2020m+2019} \frac{1}{n+1}\right) - 2020m\left(\frac{1}{2020m} - \frac{1}{2020(m+1)}\right)\right]$$ $$ = 2020\sum_{m=1}^\infty \left[\left(\sum_{n=2020m}^{2020m+2019} \frac{1}{n+1}\right) - \frac{1}{m+1}\right]$$ Now an analysis of partial sums... $$\sum_{m=1}^N \left[\left(\sum_{n=2020m}^{2020m+2019} \frac{1}{n+1}\right) - \frac{1}{m+1}\right] = \sum_{k=2021}^{2020N+2020} \frac{1}{k} - \sum_{k=2}^{N+1} \frac1k$$ $$ = H_{2020N+2020} - H_{N+1} - H_{2020} + 1 \to \log(2020) - H_{2020} + 1$$ So the answer is $\boxed{2020\left(\log(2020) - H_{2020} + 1\right)}$ .
However, I still wonder whether my answer is correct.

3961370,Show that $\int_0^a \frac{\sin x}{x} dx \leq 1+\log a$ for all $a \geq 1$,"Show that $\int_0^a \frac{\sin x}{x} dx \leq 1+\log a$ for all $a \geq 1$ . My attempt: define $f(a)=1+\log a-\int_0^a \frac{\sin x}{x}dx$ . Then the inequality is equivalent to show that $f(a) \geq 0$ for all $a \geq 1$ . $f$ is differentiable for all $a \geq 1$ , since it a sum of differentiable functions (a constant, a logarithm and an integral of a continuous function that is differentiable in the interval $0 < a \leq 1$ for the fundamental theorem of calculus) in the interval $a\in[1,\infty)$ . SO it has sense to evaluate $f'$ , and it is $$f'(a)=\frac{1}{a}-\frac{\sin a}{a}=\frac{1}{a}\left(1-\sin a\right) \geq 0 \ \ \ \ \ \forall a \geq1$$ So $f$ is increasing for all $a \geq 1$ , this means that if $f(1) \geq 0$ then $f(a) \geq 0$ for all $a \geq 1$ for monotonicity. It is $$f(1)=1-\int_0^1 \frac{\sin x}{x} dx$$ So it is $$f(1) \geq 0 \iff \int_0^1 \frac{\sin x}{x} dx \leq 1$$ Since $\sin t \leq t$ for all $t \geq 0$ and since $x\in[0,1]$ it is $\sin x \leq x \iff \frac{\sin x}{x} \leq 1$ , so for the monotonicity of the integral it is $\int_0^1 \frac{\sin x}{x} dx \leq \int_0^1 1 dx=1$ as well; this shows that the inequality is true for all $a \geq 1$ . Is my approach correct? If there is mistakes or imprecisions let me know please. If it is correct I would be glad to see other way to prove this. Thanks.","['inequality', 'definite-integrals', 'analysis']"

3961512,Evaluate $\lim_{r \to \infty} \iint_{D_r} \frac{1}{1+x^2+y^2} dx dy$,"Evaluate $$\lim_{r \to \infty} \iint_{D_r} \frac{1}{1+x^2+y^2} dx dy$$ where $D_r=\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \ \text{s.t.} \ 0 \leq y \leq 1, \ x \geq 0, \ x^2+y^2 \leq r^2 \}$ . My try is the following: I use a change of variable in polar coordinates with pole in the origin, hence $$D_r \mapsto E_r=\{(\rho, \theta) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \ \text{s.t.} \ 0 \leq \rho \sin \theta \leq 1, \rho \cos \theta \geq 0, \rho^2 \leq r^2, \rho \geq 0, 0 \leq \theta <2\pi\}$$ $$\iff \left\{(\rho, \theta) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \ \text{s.t.} \ 0 \leq \rho \leq \frac{1}{\sin \theta}, 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}, 0 \leq \rho \leq r\right\}$$ And $$\lim_{r \to \infty} \iint_{D_r} \frac{1}{1+x^2+y^2} dx dy=\lim_{r \to \infty}\iint_{E_r} \frac{\rho}{1+\rho^2} d \rho d \theta$$ Since $\rho$ has two upper bounds I discuss $0 \leq \rho \leq \min\left(r, \frac{1}{\sin \theta}\right)$ . Now, being interested in what happens when $r \to \infty$ , I assume that $r>\frac{1}{\sin \theta}$ and so I get that $\min\left(r, \frac{1}{\sin \theta}\right)=\frac{1}{\sin \theta}$ ; hence $$\lim_{r \to \infty}\iint_{E_r} \frac{\rho}{1+\rho^2} d \rho d \theta=\lim_{r \to \infty} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left(\int_0^{\min\left(r,\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\right)} \frac{\rho}{1+\rho^2}d\rho\right)d\theta$$ $$=\lim_{r \to \infty} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left(\int_0^{\frac{1}{\sin\theta}} \frac{\rho}{1+\rho^2}d\rho\right)d\theta$$ At this point both the set is independent of $r$ and so $$\lim_{r \to \infty} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left(\int_0^{\frac{1}{\sin\theta}} \frac{\rho}{1+\rho^2}d\rho\right)d\theta=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left(\int_0^{\frac{1}{\sin\theta}} \frac{\rho}{1+\rho^2}d\rho\right)d\theta=\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{2}\log\left(1+\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}\right)d\theta$$ $$=\frac{\pi}{2} \log(1+\sqrt{2})$$ The result is correct, however I'm not sure when I declare that since $r \to \infty$ I can assume $r>\frac{1}{\sin \theta}$ ; the doubt comes from the fact that $\theta \in \left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right]$ and so when $\theta$ gets really close to $0$ the function $\frac{1}{\sin \theta}$ is unbounded. So I feel like there is some kind of ""battle"" between $r$ and $\frac{1}{\sin \theta}$ going to infinity that makes impossible to understand which one is actually bigger for discussing the minimum. Am I missing something and there is no problem for $\frac{1}{\sin \theta}$ when $\theta \to 0^+$ (and if there isn't, why it isn't? Why can I ignore the fact that it tends to infinity for small values of $\theta$ in the domain of integration?) or I was just lucky and my approach was wrong because I can't make that assumption?

3961700,Interesting question regarding generating function on words,"Let $W_n$ be the set of all words of length n, on alephbet {a,b,c}.
Let $L$ be the maximal length of consecutive $a$ letters in a word. A. Find the generating function of the number of words in $W_n$ such as $L<3$ . B. Find the generating function of the number of words in $W_n$ such as $L<k$ . C. Find the expectation of $L$ , i.e $W(q,x)=\sum_n \sum_\pi x^n q^{L(\pi)}$ . Then find its asymptotic. My solution: A. Every word in $W_n$ = ""empty word"" or ""a ( )"" or ""b(every word)"" or ""c(every word)"".
Let $x$ count a lenght of a single number. So, $W(x)=1+A_1(x) + 2xW(x)$ ""a()"" =""a"" or ""aa( )"" or ""ab(every word)"" or ""ac(every word)"". So, $A_1(x)=x+A_2(x)+2x^2W(x)$ ""aa( )= ""aa"" or ""aab(every word)"" or ""aac(every word)"". So, $A_2(x)=x^2+2x^3W(x)$ . Affer substituting we get that the gf is: $W(x)=\frac{1+x+x^2}{1-2x-2x^2-2x^3}=\frac{1-x^3}{1-3x+2x^4}$ . B. As we did in part A:
Now it is the generalized problem given in A. $W(x)=1+A_1(x)+2xW(x)$ $A_1(x)=x+A_2(x)+2x^2W(x)$ $A_2(x)=x^2+A_3(x)+2x^3W(x)$ $A_3(x)=x^3+A_4(x)+2x^4W(x)$ .
. $A_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}+2x^kW(x)$ After solving this, we get: $W_k(x)=\frac{1-x^k}{1-3x+2x^{k+1}}$ C.Let $x$ count the length of a single letter, $q$ counts a letter $a$ .
We can do the same approach as part B, and see that: $W_k(q,x)=\frac{1-(qx)^k}{1-(q+2)x+2q^kx^{k+1}}$ . Then, we need to find the coefficients of $W(1,x)=W(x)$ And, $[d/dq W_k(q,x)]_{q=1}$ Then, their proportion will be the expectation.
Another way, is to look at $W^{L+1}-W_L$ then $E=\sum_L L*(W_{L+1}-W_L$ ).
But both ways are complicated for me, with these not simple generatinh functions. How can the coefficients in the two generating functions be calculated (and analyzed asymptotically)?
Or in other words how can the expectation be computed and analyzed asymptoticaly?","['combinatorics-on-words', 'combinatorics', 'asymptotics', 'generating-functions']"

3961744,"What is the relationship between $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ and $\operatorname{Spec} k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ for an algebraically closed field $k$?","I have seen that due to Hilbert's Nullstellensatz that every maximal ideal of $k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ is of the form $(x_1-a_1, \dots, x_n - a_n)$ and hence we obtain a bijection between the maximal ideals of $k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ and $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ . Specifically the map $\operatorname{MaxSpec} k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \to \mathbb{A}^n_k$ given by $(x_1-a_1, \dots, x_n-a_n) \mapsto (a_1, \dots, a_n)$ is a bijection. Now, I have seen in this question: What *is* affine space? , that apparently $\operatorname{Spec}k [x_1, \dots, x_n]$ is bijective to $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ . But then doesn't this imply (taking the above into account) that $\operatorname{MaxSpec} k[x_1, \dots, x_n] = \operatorname{Spec} k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ ? Then this would then imply that all prime ideals in $k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ are maximal which is not the case, so this must be a contradiction, which leads me to believe that there is no bijection between $\operatorname{Spec}k [x_1, \dots, x_n]$ and $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ in general. But I have seen, stated in examples in some Algebraic Geometry books, that for a field $k$ , we have that $$\operatorname{Spec} k[x_1, x_2] = \mathbb{A}^2_k.$$ However, there is a question about this here: What do prime ideals in $k[x,y]$ look like? which seems to indicate otherwise (and which also makes the case that we don't have a bijection between $\operatorname{Spec} k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ and $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ in general). So my two questions are What is the precise relationship between $\operatorname{Spec} k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ and $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ for general $n$ ? In the case $n=2$ , do we know that $\operatorname{Spec} k[x_1, x_2] = \mathbb{A}^2_k$ ? I think for question one, at the moment, all I can say is that there is an injection $\mathbb{A}^n_k \hookrightarrow \operatorname{Spec} k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ since we have the bijection between $\operatorname{MaxSpec} k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ and $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ .","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

The elementary numbers form an algebraically closed field, and are closed under application of the elementary functions. ... A Liouvillian number is one obtained by a series of algebraic, exponential or logarithmic extensions of the rationals. ... We have ... Liouvillian numbers ... $\subseteq$ Elementary numbers."" But Chow writes: ""The field $\mathbb{E}$ of EL numbers is the intersection of all subfields of $\mathbb{C}$ that are closed under $\exp$ and $\log$ . ... By analogy with elementary functions, Ritt thought of elementary numbers as the smallest
algebraically closed subfield $\mathbb{L}$ of $\mathbb{C}$ that is closed under exp and log. It so happens that terminology has evolved since Ritt, so that ""elementary numbers"" are now
numbers that can be specified implicitly as well as explicitly by exponential, logarithmic, and algebraic operations, and $\mathbb{L}$ is now sometimes called the field of Liouvillian numbers [16]."" $\ $ Until now, I couldn't find further texts with the term ""Liouvillian number"" with the meaning of one of the both articles.

So I think this question is a good exercise in that direction.] I will put a computational analogy here just to avoid jumping straight to $a \rlap {~\small+} \in A \iff a \in A, a \notin A$ , and hopefully clarify my question. Informally, if we allow $R = \{ x \mid x \not \in x \}$ to be understood as a process of building $R$ (or an algorithm in some sense), every set could be matched against the criterion sequentially, one at a time.
When it comes to $R$ itself, up to that moment it qualifies to be included.
After inclusion, it violates the criterion. So it should be removed.
At that point, the process stay indefinitely cycling between inclusion and removal. If such process is allowed to be run in parallel, i.e., all sets are matched against the criterion at once, we promptly get the finished $R$ , except for $R$ as an element of itself, whose presence is undecidable. If we accept this as part of the life, $R$ would ""exist"" in $R$ with ambivalence - it would be ""semi-contained"" by $R$ . Therefore, $\rlap {~\small+} \in$ would be given by: $a \rlap {~\small+} \in A \iff a \in A, a \notin A$ I suppose problems emerge when redefining cardinality... or the implications for the generality of this.","['elementary-set-theory', 'advice', 'paradoxes']"

Where does the mystery kick in? Is it because there hasn't been some kind of big classification theorem yet? Of course, the concept of a spinor is far less intuitive than that of a vector.

3962279,Which automorphism groups are well-understood?,"Obviously the automorphism groups of finite dimensional vector spaces are studied in great detail. By changing presentations of the vector space (by which I mean isomorphisms to some $K^{\oplus n}$ ) we can characterize automorphisms as matrices in $GL(n,K)$ and bring them in suitable shapes (thinking of Smith normal form, Jordan normal form etc). Categorically this might be due to the very special fact that every vector space is free (in particular there are no relations between generators) and that finite products and finite coproducts coincide, making computing automorphisms rather easy. But other than linear algebra I could not find other fields in mathematics, where automorphism groups are studied in that detail, which might be due to the presence of said relations. In fact it is common to reduce the study of some structure to linear algebra (e.g. via representation theory) to exploit matrices. So I was wondering, whether there are other categories, in which automorphism groups are of similar use, while being somewhat accessible/computable. Let me give some examples, to clarify what I mean. In Galois theory automorphisms of a field extension $L\mid K$ play a central role. I don’t know how easily they can be computed in specific instances though... Do the classification results of linear algebra carry over to automorphisms of finitely generated abelian groups ? It seems like there we can exploit the structure theorem to get at least a block diagonal matrix form. I was unable to find references... Automorphism groups of simple graphs seem to be rather difficult to compute, so it doesn’t seem like there is a general theory of automorphism groups of simple graphs. I would guess there are certain subcategories of good graphs, where automorphisms are  better behaved though...","['automorphism-group', 'category-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'group-theory']"
3962344,Primes represented by $x^3-21xy^2+35y^3$.,"What do we know about the primes represented by this special binary cubic form $x^3-21xy^2+35y^3$ ? I know that my question is very short, but I don't have any idea about it, and I don't know where can I find the answer in the literature. I searched through the net to find a program to check whether a binary cubic equation $f(x, y)=n$ has a solution or not, but I didn't find anything. In the case of the absence of an answer, or a reference to my question, introducing any program/ engine would be welcome. Let $\alpha$ be a root of the polynomial $x^3-21x-35=0$ , and let $K:=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ . Then it is easy to show that $$Norm(x+y\alpha+z\alpha^2)=x^3+35y^3+1225z^3-105xyz-21xy^2+441xz^2+42x^2z-735yz^2.$$ That Binary cubic form is just $Norm(x+y\alpha)$ . Note that the discriminant of $P(x)=x^3-21x-35$ is $-(4\times(-21)^3+27\times(-35)^2)=3969=3^4\times7^2$ , so discriminant of $K$ is a square, so it is a cyclic cubic Galois extension, so we can conclude that $r_1=3$ and $r_2=0$ . By Dirichlet's unit theorem, we can conclude that $\mathcal{O}_K^{\times}=\{\pm1\}\times\mathbb{Z}^2$ . Also, note that $P(x)=x^3-21x-35$ is $7$ -Eisenstein, and $P(x-1)=x^3-3x^2+3x-1-21x+21-35=x^3-3x^2-18x-15$ is $3$ -Eisenstein; so we can conclude that $\mathcal{O}_K=\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]=\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}\alpha\oplus\mathbb{Z}\alpha^2$ . Is the answer to the following question positive? Assume that $Norm(a+b\alpha+c\alpha^2)=p$ .

We can show that if $(\mu_t)_{t\in I}$ and $(\nu_t)_{t\in I}$ are tight $^1$ and bounded in total variation norm, then the family of convolutions $(\mu_t\ast\nu_t)_{t\in I}$ is tight and bounded in total variation norm as well. Now I would like to show the converse: If $(\mu_t)_{t\in I}$ and $(\mu_t\ast\nu_t)_{t\in I}$ are tight, then $(\nu_t)_{t\in I}$ is tight. (Most probably we need to impose a boundedness assumption on $(\mu_t)_{t\in I}$ and on $(\mu_t\ast\nu_t)_{t\in I}$ or even a priori on $(\nu_t)_{t\in I}$ .) For the moment, I'm only able to prove the claim assuming that the $\mu_t,\nu_t$ are probability measures. Under this assumption, the proof goes as follows: Let $\varepsilon>0$ . Since $(\mu_t)_{t\in I}$ and $(\mu_t\ast\nu_t)_{t\in I}$ are tight, there is a compact $K\subseteq E$ with $$\sup\left(\sup_{t\in I}\mu_t(K^c),\sup_{t\in I}(\mu_t\ast\nu_t)(K^c)\right)<\varepsilon\tag1.$$ Now $K-K$ is compact and \begin{equation}\begin{split}1-\varepsilon<(\mu_t\ast\nu_t)(K)&=\underbrace{\int_K\mu_t({\rm d}x)\nu_t(\underbrace{K-x}_{\subseteq\:K-K})}_{\le\:\nu_t(K-K)}+\underbrace{\int_{K^c}\mu_t({\rm d}x)\underbrace{\nu_t(K-x)}_{\le\:1}}_{<\:\varepsilon}\\&<\nu_t(K-K)+\varepsilon\end{split}\tag2\end{equation} for all $t\in I$ , which immediately yields $$\nu_t(K-K)>1-2\varepsilon\;\;\;\text{for all }t\in I\tag3.$$ Can we drop the probability measure assumption? EDIT I'm not able to obtain the claim, even with the help of the answer below. If $\varepsilon>0$ , the goal is to show that $$\nu_t(E)-\nu_t(K-K)=\nu_t((K-K)^c)<\varepsilon\tag4.$$ If I'm choosing all the constants as generic as possible, we obtain $$\mu_t(E)\le c_1\tag5$$ $$\mu_t(K^c)\le k_1(\varepsilon)\tag6$$ $$(\mu_t\ast\nu_t)(K)<c_1\nu_t(K-K)+c_2k_1(\varepsilon)\tag6$$ $$\mu_t(E)\ge\alpha_1\tag7$$ $$(\mu_t\ast\nu_t)(E)\le c_3\tag8$$ $$\nu_t(E)\le\frac{c_3}{\alpha_1}=:c_2\tag9$$ $$(\mu_t\ast\nu_t)(E)\ge\alpha_3\tag{10}$$ $$\nu_t(E)\ge\frac{\alpha_3}{c_1}\tag{11}$$ $$(\mu_t\ast\nu_t)(K^c)<k_3(\varepsilon)$$ The assumptions that I'm imposing is that $(\mu_t)$ and $(\mu_t\ast\nu_t)$ are bounded above (by $c_1$ and $c_3$ ) and below (by $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_3$ ) in total variation norm and are tight (so that we can find $K$ for arbitrary $k_1(\varepsilon)$ and $k_3(\varepsilon)$ ). In order to obtain the claim we need to choose $k_1(\varepsilon)$ and $k_3(\varepsilon)$ such that $(4)$ holds. From everything above, we obtain $$\nu_t(E)-\nu_t(K-K)<\frac{c_3}{\alpha_1}-\frac{\alpha_3}{c_1}+\frac{c_3}{\alpha_1c_1}k_1(\varepsilon)+\frac1{c_1}k_3.(\varepsilon)\tag{12}$$ Even if we simplify this by assuming $\alpha_1=\alpha_3$ , $c_1=c_3$ and $k_1(\varepsilon)=k_3(\varepsilon)$ , the equation $$\frac{c_3}{\alpha_1}-\frac{\alpha_3}{c_1}+\frac{c_3}{\alpha_1c_1}k_1(\varepsilon)+\frac1{c_1}k_3.(\varepsilon)=\varepsilon\tag{13}$$ doesn't seem to admit a solution $(k_1(\varepsilon),k_3(\varepsilon))$ with positive $k_1(\varepsilon)$ and $k_3(\varepsilon)$ ; unless $\frac{c_3}{\alpha_1}-\frac{\alpha_3}{c_1}\ge0$ ; which clearly doesn't need to be the case (it is clearly the case for probability measures though ...) $^1$ Remember that a family $\mathcal F$ of finite signed measures on $\mathcal B(E)$ is called tight if for all $\varepsilon>0$ , there is a compact $K\subseteq E$ such that $$\sup_{\mu\in\mathcal F}|\mu|(K^c)<\varepsilon.$$","['measure-theory', 'probability-theory']"

Now it is a known fact that, if $A$ is a unital $C^*$ -algebra, then $A$ is finite if and only if $s^*s=1_A\implies ss^*=1_A$ for all $s\in A$ , i.e. every isometry is a unitary. Let $n\geq1$ . We have that $M_n(C(X))\cong C(X,M_n(\mathbb{C}))$ . Now let $s\in C(X,M_n(\mathbb{C}))$ be an isometry, i.e. $s^*s=1_{C(X,M_n)}$ , i.e. $s(x)^*s(x)=1_{M_n}$ for all $x\in X$ . Since $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ is finite (obviously) we conclude that $s(x)s(x)^*=1_{M_n}$ for all $x\in X$ , thus $ss^*=1_{C(X,M_n)}$ and this shows that $C(X)$ is stably finite. Is this correct or am I missing something? Anyone knows of any resource that refers to this? Edit: I can think of a second proof for the separable case (i.e. if-f $X$ is metrizable): if so, then $C(X)$ admits a faithful tracial state and then so do $M_n(C(X))$ , so all of those are finite $C^*$ -algebras. And even more generally, it seems like $C(X,A)$ is stably finite whenever $A$ is (since $M_n(C(X,A))\cong M_n\otimes C(X)\otimes A\cong C(X)\otimes M_n(A)\cong C(X,M_n(A))$ ).","['c-star-algebras', 'solution-verification', 'functional-analysis', 'operator-algebras']"

Just as I feel comfy about the difference, the confusion is again brought up by the book and I indirectly quote in the following, in hopes of making it as short as possible: The nested interval property assumes that each $I_n$ contains $I_{n+1}$ . They are a nested sequence of closed intervals defined as such. $I_n = [a_n, b_n] = \{x\in\mathbb R : a_n\leq x \leq b_n\}$ .

Hence, $x\in \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ and the intersection is not empty. Let me know if the missed out details are needed.

The sum of two numbers are $a$ , the sum of the 3rd powers is $10a^3$ . Calculate the sum of the 4th powers, expressed in $a$ . Is there a shorter/simpler solution than the one presented below? It feels there is some ‘trick’ to it. The solution presented below is more a ‘straight forward’ one. Solution We have \begin{gather*}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
x+y&=a\\
x^3+y^3&=10a^3

\right.
\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
x^3+(a-x)^3=10a^3
\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
x^2-ax-3a^2=0

x_{1,2}=\tfrac{1}{2}(1\pm\sqrt{13}\,)a
\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad
y_{1,2}=\tfrac{1}{2}(1\mp\sqrt{13}\,)a.
$$ Since $$
(1+z)^4+(1-z)^4=2(1+6z^2+z^4)
$$ we have \begin{align*}
x_1^4+y_1^4
&
=\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}(1+\sqrt{13}\,)a\bigr)^{\!4}+\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}(1-\sqrt{13}\,)a\bigr)^{\!4}

\\&=\tfrac{a^4}{8}(1+6\cdot13+13^2)
=\tfrac{a^4}{8}\cdot248
=31a^4

3963375,What is the value of $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{\unicode{x22F0}}}}$?,"Motivation I have been thinking about this thing for quite a while now. I have tried many ways but couldn't really figure it out. I am pretty sure that this kind of expressions don't really have a closed form, so I am asking for other representation for example maybe in terms of an infinite sum or product or something. Creating A New Notation Just like there is a notation for a sum $\textstyle\displaystyle{\sum_{n=a}^{b}s_n=s_a+\cdots+s_b}$ and also for a product $\textstyle\displaystyle{\prod_{n=a}^{b}s_n=s_a\cdots s_b}$ , I was quite surprised that there wasn't  any notation for exponentiation. I would agree that there wouldn't be any use for this notation but still, why would no mathematician ever would create such a notation just for the sake of curiosity. That is why I would request readers to give me any references if there are any. I haven't found any, so I am creating my own. Let $$\boxed{\textstyle\displaystyle{{\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=a}^{b}s_k=s_a^{\unicode{x22F0}^{s_b}}}}$$ where $b>a$ . If $a>b$ then $\textstyle\displaystyle{{\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=a}^{b}s_k=1}$ and $\textstyle\displaystyle{{\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=a}^{b}x=^{b-a+1}x}$ . Obviously $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ . Unlike product and sum, exponentiation isn't commutative so we have to be careful when using the notation. Maybe we can modify it a little bit to include the ordering. By the way we are defining $\textstyle\displaystyle{{\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=a}^{\infty}s_k:= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left({\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=a}^{n}s_k\right)}.$ Some Natural Questions When written out in the form of this notation, some natural curious questions arrive or at least some arrived in my mind, for example $\textstyle\displaystyle{{\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^s}}$ and $\textstyle\displaystyle{{\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}}$ . My Curiosity My initial curiosity was $H=\textstyle\displaystyle{{\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{\unicode{x22F0}}}}}$ . As pointed out by Tavish in the comments, this can be written as a recurrence relation given by $$\textstyle\displaystyle{a_{n+1}=-\frac{\ln(a_n)}{\ln(n)}}$$ where $\textstyle\displaystyle{a_n=\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{n+1}\right)^{\unicode{x22F0}}}}$ . Solving this will help us derive $H$ . But as pointed out in the comments and in this question ( Note that this question focuses on the convergence of $H$ , while my question focuses on something different ), $H$ doesn't really make much sense by the definition of infinite power tower above because it seems that $$\textstyle\displaystyle{\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left({\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=2}^{2n}\frac{1}{k}\right)\neq\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left({\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=2}^{2n+1}\frac{1}{k}\right)}.$$ In particular, we have \begin{align}H_O&=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left({\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=2}^{2n+1}\frac{1}{k}\right)=0.6903471261\cdots\\H_E&=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left({\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=2}^{2n}\frac{1}{k}\right)=0.6583655992\cdots\end{align} Let $E_n=\textstyle\displaystyle{{\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=2}^{2n}\frac{1}{k}}$ and $O_n=\textstyle\displaystyle{{\huge\varepsilon\normalsize}_{k=2}^{2n+1}\frac{1}{k}}$ . I tried constructing a recurrence relation for $E_n$ and $O_n$ , but couldn't, except \begin{align}E_{n+1}&=\left(\log_{\frac{1}{2n-1}}(\cdots\log_{\frac{1}{2}}(E_n))\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{2n+1}\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{2n+2}\right)}}\\O_{n+1}&=\left(\log_{\frac{1}{2n}}(\cdots\log_{\frac{1}{2}}(O_n))\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{2n+2}\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{2n+3}\right)}}\end{align} which is not really workable. If there is a way to simplify it then please do tell me or write a partial answer about it, because it would help us a lot in finding the values of $H_E$ and $H_O$ . My Question I am pretty sure that there really isn't closed form of $H_E$ and $H_O$ .

3963398,Coherent sheaves vs sheaves locally of finite presentation,"I think it is clear for most people that finitely generated and finitely presented modules are important and, in a certain sense, the ""right"" notions.

A sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ of $\mathscr{O}_X$ -modules is said to be coherent if every point of $X$ has a neighborhood $U$ over which there is an exact sequence $ \mathscr{O}_X^{\oplus m}|_U\to \mathscr{F}|_U\to 0$ (that is, $\mathscr{F}$ is finitely generated) and for any open set $V\subset X$ , any natural number $n$ , and any morphism $\varphi:\mathscr{O}_X^{\oplus n}|_V\to \mathscr{F}|_V$ , the kernel of $\varphi$ is finitely generated. It is very clear to me that quasi-coherentness is a relevant notion. But I don't understand why coherent is a more usual notion than locally of finite presentation, which seems more natural to be. In https://mathoverflow.net/questions/68125/qcoh-algebraic-stack and in Stalks of the sheaf $\mathscr{H}om$? A. Vistoli and M. Brandenburg seem to imply that the ""correct"" notion is indeed that of local finite presentation. I would like to understand what are the differences between those notions.

3963607,"Is $x=2,y=13$ the unique solution?","Problem: Find all positive integers $x$ and $y$ satisfying: $$12x^4-6x^2+1=y^2.$$ If $x=1, 12x^4-6x^2+1=12-6+1=7,$ which is not a perfect square. If $x=2, 12x^4-6x^2+1=192-24+1=169=13^2$ , which is a perfect square. Thus, $x=2,y=13$ is a solution to the given Diophantine equation. However, after testing a few more small cases, it seems as if $12x^4-6x^2+1$ can never be a perfect square if $x>2$ . I have tried to prove this, but to no avail. Here is the gist of what I considered: $12x^4-6x^2+1=y^2 \iff 12x^4-6x^2 = (y+1)(y-1)$ . Since the L.H.S. is a multiple of $2$ , it follows that $2 \mid (y+1)(y-1) \Rightarrow y$ is odd $\Rightarrow y+1$ and $y-1$ are both even. Hence, $4 \mid (y+1)(y-1) \Rightarrow 4 \mid  12x^4-6x^2 \Rightarrow 4 \mid 6x^2 \Rightarrow x $ is even. Let $x=2m$ and $y+1=2k$ , so $12x^4-6x^2=192m^4-24m^2=4k(k-1) \Rightarrow 48m^4-6m^2=k(k-1)$ . At this point, I am at a loss of how to continue. We could continue with divisibility arguments, but it seems to be a never-ending process? Another method I tried was to let $y=x+k$ , thus $12x^4-6x^2+1 = x^2 + 2xk+k^2 \iff k^2+2xk-(12x^4-7x^2+1)=0$ , which is a quadratic in terms of $k$ . However, stuff like the discriminant or sum and product of roots did not seem to yield any important information. Any hints provided to point me in the right direction will be much appreciated.","['contest-math', 'elementary-number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'algebra-precalculus', 'quartics']"

3963662,"Functions vanishing to infinite order ""in $1$-mean""","When proving certain unique continuation theorems for classes of functions which satisfy some type of PDE inequality, people often talk about functions which vanish to infinite order at a point $x_0$ in the $q$ -mean in the sense that, if $u: \Omega \to \mathbb{C^n}$ is an $L^q$ -function, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an open set: $$\int_{|x - x_0| \leq r} |u(x)|^q dx = O(r^k), \hspace{5pt} \forall k \in \mathbb{N}.$$ By Hölder's inequality, we know that if $u$ vanishes to infinite order in the $q$ -mean, and $p<q$ , then $u$ also vanishes to infinite order in the $p$ -mean. Vanishing to infinite order in the sense that we're used to for smooth functions (i.e, $|u(x)| = O(|x-x_0|^k)$ when $ x \to x_0$ for all $k$ ; this makes sense even for non-smooth functions) is equivalent to vanishing to infinite order in the $p$ -mean for $p = \infty.$ My question can be phrased in two ways: Does the converse hold? I.e, if $p<q$ , and $u$ vanishes to infinite order in the $p$ -mean, does it also vanish to infinite order in the $q$ -mean? A more specific version of the question which I'm interested in, for the purpose of $J$ -holomorphic curves: if $u$ is a smooth function and $n=2$ (for example, $\Omega$ can be a small open disk around $0$ ), does vanishing to infinite order in the $1$ -mean imply vanishing to infinite order in the usual sense, i.e. $D^{\alpha}u(0) = 0$ for all multi-indices $\alpha$ ? This is stated in Section 2.3. of the McDuff-Salamon book ""J-holomorphic curves and symplectic topology."" I was able to show this for $|\alpha| = 0,1$ , but I wasn't able to solve the general case, where I get stuck at an expression of the form $$\int_{|z| \leq r} |(D^k u)_0(z,\dots,z)|dz \leq M_Nr^N, \hspace{7pt} \forall N, \forall r<r_0.$$ I was also able to show that it's true when $u$ is holomorphic, due to the specific nature of the $k$ th derivative in this case.","['integration', 'multivariable-calculus', 'symplectic-geometry']"

3963735,Example where natural density exists but binomial density does not,"I was reading Persi Diaconis's PhD Dissertation, Weak and Strong Averages in Probability and the Theory of Numbers (warning: pdf), and found the following theorem on page 25: Theorem 3. If a set of integers has binomial density $\ell$ , then it has natural density $\ell$ but not conversely. If needed, I define what is meant by natural and binomial density in the section below (separated out by horizontal bars). We may define the italicized terms as follows: Let $A$ be a set of positive integers. We define the natural density of $A$ to be $$d\left(A\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}a\left(k\right),$$ where $a\left(k\right)$ is $1$ when $k\in A$ and $0$ otherwise. In other words, this is the limit of uniform probabilities of selecting an element of $A$ in the intervals $\left\{1,\ldots,n\right\}$ as $n\to\infty$ . In order to define binomial density, let's first rewrite the natural density (if it exists) as $$d\left(A\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}a\left(k\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n}a\left(k\right)\cdot\frac{1}{n}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n}a\left(k\right)u\left(k,n\right),$$ where $u\left(k,n\right)=\frac{1}{n}$ is the (uniform) probability of selecting $k$ in $\left\{1,\ldots,n\right\}$ . Let's replace the uniform distribution with the binomial distribution. Let $b\left(k,n,p\right)={n\choose k}p^{k}\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}$ for $k=0,1,\ldots, n$ and $0$ otherwise (making sure to select $p\neq0,1$ ). We define the binomial density of $A$ [with parameter $p$ ] (if it exists) as $$B\left(A,p\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}a\left(k\right)b\left(k,n,p\right).$$ (Note: Our sum also now starts at $0$ instead of $1$ .) Diaconis gives the following combinatorial interpretation of binomial density: Flip a coin $n$ times and count how many heads show up. For large $n$ , the probability that the resulting number of heads flipped is in the set $A$ is approximately $\ell$ . Question: Since Theorem 3 says that binomial density $\implies$ natural density (where implication here means that the existence of the former guarantees the existence of the latter and their values coincide), but not the converse, what does a set with natural density but no binomial density look like? In the proof of Theorem 3, Diaconis alludes to a counterexample to the converse of the following Theorem 4. Theorem 4. If $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has Borel density $\ell$ , then $A$ has Abelian density $\ell$ . He cites a previous paper of his, Limits of measures of the integers with application to random number generators and the distribution of leading digits (pp. 19-20), which I am unable to find. This counterexample to the converse of Theorem 4 would also answer my question, since binomial density $\implies$ Borel density $\implies$ Abelian density $\iff$ natural density. I will accept an answer which either: 1) constructs a counterexample to the converse of Theorem 3 directly, or 2) provides a link to where I can find Diaconis's previous paper along with an explanation of the counterexample to the converse of Theorem 4.","['number-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'reference-request']"

3963805,Group $G$ such that $(ab)^p = a^pb^p$ for some prime $p$,"This is a question taken from Herstein's ""Topics in Algebra"", second edition, section 2.6. It goes: Let $G$ be a group such that $(ab)^p = a^p b^p$ for all $a, b \in G$ , where $p$ is a prime number. Let $S = \{ x \in G \mid x^{p^m} = e\text{ for some } m \text{ depending on }x\}$ . Prove: (a) $S$ is normal in $G$ ; (b) If $\overline{G} = G/S$ and if $\overline{x} \in \overline{G}$ is such that $\overline{x}^p = \overline{e}$ then $\overline{x} = \overline{e}$ My solution (a) $S$ is closed: if $x, y \in S$ , there are some $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x^{p^m} = y^{p^n} = e$ . Therefore, if we take $m+n \in \mathbb{N}$ , $(xy)^{p^{m+n}} = x^{p^{m+n}} y^{p^{m+n}}$ (this can be proved by induction) $= (x^{p^{m}})^{p^n}(y^{p^n})^{p^m} = e$ $e \in S$ , trivially If $x \in S$ , you can take the same $m \in \mathbb{N}$ for $x^{-1}$ If $x \in S$ and $g \in G$ , $(gxg^{-1})^{p^m} = gx^{p^m}g^{-1} = e$ , so $S$ is normal in $G$ (b) If $\overline{x}^p = \overline{e}$ , then $x^p \in S$ , which means there is some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $(x^p)^{p^m} = e$ , meaning $x^{p^{m+1}} = e$ , and so $x \in S \iff \overline{x} = \overline{e}$ The induction proof For $m = 1$ , the claim is clear by hypothesis. If $(xy)^{p^k} = x^{p^k}y^{p^k}$ for all $k$ up to $m \in \mathbb{N}$ , then $(xy)^{p^m} = (xy)^{p^{m-1}*p} = ((xy)^{p^{m-1}})^p = (x^{p^{m-1}}y^{p^{m-1}})^p = x^{p^m}y^{p^m}$ , which concludes the proof. The question My problem is that never have I used the primality of p, and I sort of assumed $m \in \mathbb{N}$ , as Herstein gives no indication of where $m$ is taken from in the set definition. Is the above proof correct? As I said, I suspect not, because of the extra condition on $p$ , but I can't see a mistake here, and I have been looking for a while now...

3963831,Some questions regarding the $L^2$ space,"Let $(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu)$ be a measure space, and let $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}_\mathbb{R})$ be the Borel space associated to $\mathbb{R}$ .
Also, let $$\mathcal{L}^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})=\bigg\{f:(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi})\to(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}_\mathbb{R})\,\,\Big|\,\int f^2\,\mathrm{d}\mu<\infty\bigg\}$$ be the set of all (real-valued) square-integrable (measurable) functions with respect to (the measure) $\mu$ . Then can we say the following? When the Lebesgue space $L^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})$ is viewed as a set, it is defined as the quotient set: $$L^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})_\text{set}:=\mathcal{L}^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})\,\,/\sim,$$ where $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $\mathcal{L}^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})$ such that: $$f\sim g\quad:\Leftrightarrow\quad f-g=0\,\text{ $\mu$-almost everywhere.}$$ Is this the definition of $L^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})$ as a set? If so, what does ' $\mu$ -almost everywhere' actually mean in the above definition?
Some authors seem to imply that (but of course I may be wrong with this interpretation): $$f(\xi)\neq g(\xi)\quad\Rightarrow\quad \mu(\xi)=0$$ when they say that if $f=g$ then $f$ and $g$ differ only on a set of measure zero. Here $\xi\in\Xi$ .
However, for this to work, we require that $\{\xi\}$ is an element of the $\sigma$ -algebra $\boldsymbol{\Xi}$ to make sure that $\{\xi\}\mapsto\mu(\xi)$ is well-defined.
This therefore imposes a hidden requirement on the definition of $\boldsymbol{\Xi}$ (which I don't like).
Or is this the correct interpretation? $$f-g=0\,\text{ $\mu$-almost everywhere}\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad\int (f-g)^2\,\mathrm{d}\mu=0.$$ The reason why we want to define such an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\mathcal{L}^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})$ is that if we equip $L^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})$ with the bilinear map: $$\langle\,\cdot\,,\cdot\,\rangle:L^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})\times L^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})\to\mathbb{R}\quad:\Leftrightarrow\quad\langle f,g\rangle=\int fg\,\mathrm{d}\mu,$$ then $\langle\,\cdot\,,\cdot\,\rangle$ qualifies as an inner product on $L^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})$ because it satisfies the positive-definite condition of an inner product.
Is this the correct motivation? $L^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})$ is by definition a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ , and no further structure is assumed on $L^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})_\text{set}$ . If nothing is said, all (equivalence classes of) measurable functions in $L^2(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi},\mu;\mathbb{R})$ are always assumed to be maps from $(\Xi,\boldsymbol{\Xi})$ into the Borel measurable space $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}_\mathbb{R})$ , aren't they?

I would appreciate it very much.) Thank you,
