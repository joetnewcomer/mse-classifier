2378208,Isometric embedding of Riemannian manifolds into Minkowski space,"I was wondering if there are any existence results similar to the Nash embedding theorem where a manifold with a Riemannian metric is isometrically embedded into flat Minkowski space, with metric of signature $(-,+,\ldots,+)$.  Allowing for the target space to be of Lorentzian signature certainly seems to help with negatively curved Riemannian metrics, i.e. the two dimensional hyperbolic plane has no isometric embedding in $\mathbb{R}^3$, however, it is easily embedded into Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$ as a surface of constant proper time away from the origin.  The question would be given a Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$, what is the minimal dimension of Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}$ in which the surface is isometrically embeddable?","['manifolds', 'hyperbolic-geometry', 'isometry', 'differential-geometry']"

2378270,Is this hypothesis necessary for Fubini's theorem (simple version for Riemann integrals),"I've seen the following statement of Fubini's theorem for double integrals in a multivariable course notes: Let $I=[a,b]×[c,d]$ and $f:I\to \mathbb{R}$ an integrable function. If foreach $x \in [a,b]$ the function $g_x(y)=(x,y)$ is integrable, then $$\int \int_I f=\int_a^b\int_c^df(x,y)dydx$$ But I've also found this more general version: Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $B \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ be closed boxes (i.e product of closed intervals) and $f:A×B \to \mathbb{R}$ an integrable function. If for each $x \in A$ the function $g_x(y)=f(x,y)$ is integrable, then $$\int_{A×B}f=\int_A\int_B f$$ provided $\int_A\int_B f$ exists. So my question is why is that extra hypothesis needed in the second version. Vould someone provide an example illustrating this necessity?

2378293,How to pick an apartment -- a probability problem,"Knowing a solution to the following well-defined problem could help many students and other low-wage workers feel more confident when selecting a home in a new town.  Its conditions are inspired by my current experience hunting for a room in Santa Cruz, CA.  I'd certainly apply the solution to my current search. The Problem: Andy is trying to find a room to rent in cool house.  Let's suppose there are (countably) infinitely many houses to pick from and Andy... visits one house each day. must, each day, decide to move in to that day's house, or abandon the option and keep looking. immediately knows how a house ranks relative to the other houses he's seen.  I.e. after any number of days, $k$, he can write down an ordered list $(h_1, h_2, ..., h_k)$ of the houses he's seen (ordered by his personal preference). has a constant probability, $p$, of being accepted a house once he asks to move in.  If accepted he keeps his word, if not, he keeps looking. has $N$ days to pick a house -- after $N$ days Andy must ask to move into every house he visits. Find a strategy that maximizes the expected percentile (among the infinitely many houses available) of the house Andy ends up in. Note, I've come across related problems phrased in terms of: * receiving an envelope containing an amount of money and deciding to keep the money, or go on to the next envelope. * walking down a street picking a (maybe Chinese) restaurant.

2378308,The correspondence between complex spin structures and associated clifford module structure,"The usual definition of a $spin^c$ structure on a riemannian manifold $M$ is often given by (the equivalence class of) the lifting of the frame bundle $P\to M$ of the tangent bundle $TM$ via the standard homomorphism $Spin^c(n)\to SO(n)$. And there is yet another definition given in Monopoles and Three-manifolds, Kronheimer and Mrowka : A $spin^c$ structure is a choice of ""spinor bundle"" $S$ (a complex vector bundle of proper dimension) and a Clifford multiplication $\rho : TM\to End(S)$ which satisfies $\rho(X)^2=-\left<X,X\right>id_{S}$ (hence extendable to the action of the Clifford algebra on $S$, $Cl(TM)\to End(S)$ which we furthermore assume that this restricts to the spin representation $Cl(T_xM)\to End(S_x)$ on each fiber). (It might be the case that this definition is only valid in low-dimensional manifolds, especially 3 and 4Ds.) Sadly this is where I stuck. After some searching, the equivalence between these two definitions is a forklore to experts, but it is hard to find the reference to the proof. My current understanding is, From the first definition to the second, the correspondence is (should be?) via the associated bundle construction w.r.t. the standard $spin^c$ representation $Spin^c(n)\to End(\Delta)$. For this direction, I have no confusion, this is totally fine with me. For the reverse direction, I have little clue. I only feel there would be a similar construction as ""the frame bundle construction of a vector bundle that makes a correspondence between $SO(n)$-bundles and (oriented) vector bundles"". But what can be a version of frames in the case of spinors? Or it might be possible that we can directly show the bijectiveness of the correspondence from the first to the second. But, from the second definition, I feel there's more freedom than the first, say we can choose a trivial bundle of proper dimension as $S$ and then there's no obstruction in defining a Clifford multiplication map $TM\to End(S)$ (at least considering the fact that End(S) has much larger dimension than $TM$). So, in this approach, the bijective correspondence seems rather a miracle to me.","['algebraic-topology', 'spin-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

2378414,Why do we care about normal matrices/operators?,"We know that normal operators are ""nice"".  In the finite dimensional case, the spectral theorem tells us everything we need to know.  In the infinite dimensional case, we can define a continuous functional calculus over the (bounded) normal operators (admittedly I don't know much about the unbounded case).  However, is there a context in which we should ""expect"" an operator to be normal?  That is: Is there a common application of linear algebra (or operator theory) in which we would expect the operator we're working with to be an arbitrary normal operator? There are many contexts in which we might expect the operator in question to be self-adjoint (the Hessian matrix for instance), and there are certainly some in which we might expect the operator to be unitary/orthogonal (the orthogonal Procrustes problem comes to mind).  However, I'm looking for a ""natural"" application in which we might expect a normal operator of any sort , but not expect a non-normal operator.

2378428,How to create a positive definite covariance matrix from an adjacency matrix?,"I am currently trying to create a covariance matrix from an adjacency matrix. I would like to create the covariance matrix by the following two steps: 1) Wherever there is a connection, I would place a correlation parameter $\rho$. 2) Replace the diagonals of all $0$'s with a common variance, like $1$. As a reproducible example, consider the following adjacency matrix for $5$ nodes: $$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
\end{pmatrix}
$$ We can see from the first row that node $1$ is connected with node $4$ and node $5$. From this, we replace all the $1$'s with a common correlation parameter $\rho$ and put a $1$ in the diagonal to get: $$
\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & \rho & \rho \\ 
0 & 1 & \rho & 0 & \rho \\

Find the heat flow across the curved surface of the cylinder. The solution says that $T = \dfrac{\alpha}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$ where $\alpha$ is a constant and hence $\mathbf{F} = \dfrac{\alpha k(x, y, z)}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}$ $= \dfrac{\alpha k(r\cos(\theta), r\sin(\theta), z)}{(r^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}$ How and why did we go from $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ to $(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{3/2}$? This isn't explained in the solution. In $T = \dfrac{\alpha}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$, presuming $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ is meant to be the distance from the centre of the cylinder, shouldn't we have $z = 0$ such that we get $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ as the distance from any point to the centre of the cylinder? This is because the formula for the distance between any two points in a cylinder (and indeed any object in $\mathbb{R}^3$) is $d(P_1, P_2) = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$. Since we want the distance to the centre of the cylinder, we would have $z_2 = z_1$ such that $z_2 - z_1 = 0$. So shouldn't it actually be $T = \dfrac{\alpha}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}$ where $\alpha$ is a constant? I would greatly appreciate it if people could please take the time to clarify this.","['vector-fields', 'real-analysis', 'surface-integrals', 'multivariable-calculus', 'mathematical-modeling']"

Here is my solution: Let $0<a<b$, then $(0,b)=(0,a) \cup [a,b)$ thus $$\int_a^bf= \int_0^bf - \int_0^af \Rightarrow \int_a^bf=0$$ Now we have that $ \mathbb{R}= \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}[n,n+1)$ which is a disjoint union, thus $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}}f=\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \int_n^{n+1}f=0$$. Also we know that$$\{x:f(x)\neq 0\}= \{x:f(x)>0\} \cup \{x:f(x)<0\}=\{x:f(x)>0\} \cup \{x:-f(x)>0\}$$. Now $\{x:f(x)>0\}=\{x:f(x)> \frac{1}{n}\})$ thus $m(\{x:f(x)> \frac{1}{n}\})\leqslant n \int_{\mathbb{R}}f=0$ therefore $m(\{x:f(x)> \frac{1}{n}\})=0 \Rightarrow m(\{x:f(x)>0\})=0$, from the subadditivity of the Lebesgue measure and from the Markov inequality. With the same argument we can prove that $m(\{x:-f(x)>0\})=0$ Combining these we have that $$m(\{x:f(x) \neq 0\}) \leqslant m(\{x:f(x)>0\})+m(\{x:-f(x)>0\})=0$$ $\therefore$ $m(\{x:f(x) \neq 0\})=0$ $$Second-solution$$ Now $ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$ we have in the same way as above that $\frac{1}{2 \delta}\int_{x-\delta}^{x+\delta}f(y)dy=0 ,\forall \delta>0$. From Lebesgue's differentation theorem we have that $\lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{2\delta}\int_{x-\delta}^{x+\delta}f(y)dy =f(x)$ almost everywhere. Thus $f(x)=0$ almost everywhere.

I have some Solutions from the Book I have found, which is great by the way: ""Graphical Enumeration by Harary and Palmer"", but I am lacking some understand of algebra (and a lot of other stuff I don't even know about). Problems: a)""necklaces problem"" 4 Beads, 2 Colors(black and white) b)""necklaces problem"" 4 Beads, 3 Colors(red, white and blue) c) Any modification of these two but with limits on pearls<4, this will be clear later why. (Maybe I am mistaken on this point) Lets start with a) What I have understood so far, that A is Group determined by the object I want to enumerate. For the necklace problem its the $D_4$ Group. This here I don't get quite. I mean I can understand why its $D_4$. But I can modify it. Qestion1: Maybe someone could provide an example what could be counted. Let it now be the $D_4$ Group. Now I am facing the next Problem, I need to evaluate $Z(D_4)$ I have no clue what this is, BUT the book tells me exactly how to calculate it.(Great Book by the way) Why the hell no one told me this before?! I need to calculate $Z(C_4)$ then plug in. On the page before one could find the Formula for $Z(C_4)$. Awesome! n=4, The Limitation k|n means k is in range of {1,2,4}, and $\varphi(k)$ take values $\varphi(1)=1,\varphi(2)=1,\varphi(4)=2$. The $s_i$ are variables, at least that's the book says, but the have a meaning. For example in $S_3$ Permutation Group on 3 letters: Question2: I have at this point no clue what $s_4$ in $S_4$ is. Okey lets evaluate $$Z(C_4)=4^{-1}(s_1^4+1s_2^2+2s_4)$$ I have simply plugged in the values from above! Now I am applying the Corollary from above to get $D_4$ (used the even option since n=4) $$D_4=\frac{1}{2}Z(C_4)+\frac{1}{4}(s_2^{2}+s_1^2s_2)$$
$$D_4=\frac{1}{2}4^{-1}(s_1^4+1s_2^2+2s_4)+\frac{1}{4}(s_2^{2}+s_1^2s_2)$$
$$D_4=\frac{1}{8}(s_1^4+2s_1^2s_2+3s_3^2+2s_4)$$ nice this is also what the book says at this point. Question 3: How now the 1+x comes into play? Will this part by modified if I have more beads? It definitely gets modified if I get more colors. Now the great finale! Question4: Why is the Number of Necklaces C(1), What do i get for C(0),C(2),C(4) The book says its C(1) Now short version of b) Question 5: Why is $c(x)=1+x_1+x_2$ and $Z(D_4,3)$ ?

(In other words: given a triangular piece of cardboard, what is the largest equilateral triangle that you can cut out of it?) She also came up with the following heuristic/conjecture: take the largest angle of the given triangle. (It is guaranteed to be at least $60^\circ = \pi/3$, as not all three angles of a triangle can be less than that.) Now the answer (the largest inscribed equilateral triangle) can be found among those made by marking off a $60^\circ$ angle at that vertex, with the two ends chosen somehow. (In other words: the inscribed equilateral triangle can be chosen to have that vertex as one of its vertices.) My intuition for geometry is not so good. :-) I played with a few examples in Geogebra and couldn't find any counterexamples, nor could I think of a proof, so I'm asking here. This is similar to Find the maximum area possible of equilateral triangle that inside the given square and a special case of Largest Equilateral Triangle in a Polygon (whose paper I don't have access to—all I could find via citations to that paper is that it gives an $O(n^3)$ algorithm—and in any case the problem may be simpler for a triangle).

Can such a triangle always be found with one vertex at one of the vertices of the given triangle, specifically the one with the largest angle?

contains an element $f_0$ such that $f_0^{(n)}$ has at most $n+1$ roots for all $n\in\mathbb{N}_0$. Intuitively I'm somewhat inclined to think it's false. Do anyone know if this holds, or how I should go on about finding out? If $f_0^{(n)}$ has $n+1$ roots, then by the mean value theorem $f_0^{(n+1)}$ has $n$ distinct roots in the interior of the support in addition to the boundary points being roots. Hence by induction $f_0^{(n)}$ must have $n+1$ roots for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. As to whether the lower bound is non-strict, I think maybe the way to go is to assume that $(a_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence with $a_i \in S$ and $a_i^{(i)}$ having at most $i+1$ roots. Because if those properties imply that not all derivatives of $a_i$ remain bounded as $i\to\infty$, then no such sequence can have an element of $S$ as limit, and so the lower bound must be strict. I made some numerically experiments with linear programs which indicated the existence of such a sequence where also $\sup_x a_i^{(1)}(x)<2$. So several derivatives must be considered simultaneously.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'functions']"

$$I(x,y)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{(x+y)^2}{2}\right),$$
but can't prove this. The closest I got to a solution (though it's not much) is this: If $(W_t)_{t\geq0}$ is a standard Brownian motion and
$$H_x:=\inf\{t\geq0:W_t=x\}$$
is the first hitting time of some point $x>0$, then,
$$\mathbb P\{H_x=\mathrm dt\}=\frac{x}{\sqrt{2\pi t^3}}\exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{2t}\right).$$ By the strong Markov property, if $H_x$ and $H_y$ are independent Brownian hitting times, then
$$H_x+H_y=_dH_{x+y},$$
where the above is an equality in distribution. Thus, it follows from a convolution argument that if
$$I'(x,y):=\int_0^1\frac{x}{\sqrt{2\pi t^3}}\exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{2t}\right)\cdot\frac{y}{\sqrt{2\pi (1-t)^3}}\exp\left(-\frac{y^2}{2(1-t)}\right)~\mathrm dt,$$
then
$$I'(x,y)=\mathbb P\{H_{x+y}=\mathrm d1\}=\frac{x+y}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{(x+y)^2}{2}\right).$$ So the integral $I(x,y)$ is somewhat similar, but instead of being a convolution of two hitting time densities, it is the convolution of one hitting time density together with a Gaussian density where the variance is integrated.","['probability-theory', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'brownian-motion']"

For example, if $j=2^2, n=3^2$, I would sum over all $i$ which have no factors of 2,3; that is, $i$ of the form $i=5^{a_5}\cdots p^{a_p}$ to obtain $$\sum_{i=5^{a_5}\cdots{p^{a_p}}}1/i=\sum_{a_k\ge 0}\frac{1}{5^{a_5}\cdots p^{a_p}}=5/4*7/6$$ where the last equation follows by geometric series: $\sum 1/p^{a_p}=p/(p-1)$.

where the diffusion tensor is $D(x)=\sigma(x)\,\sigma(x)^T$, which also appears in the equation for the infinitesimal generator . Furthermore, it is common to consider $D$ as the contravariant (inverse) metric tensor of a Riemannian manifold, i.e. $D=g^{-1}$. Ignoring $\mu$, notice there are three reasonable ways to define the variance of the process: $\sigma$, $D$, or $g$. My question is this: I have two diffusion processes, one with $\sigma$, $D$, and $g$, and another with $\hat{\sigma}$, $\hat{D}$, and $\hat{g}$. I want to create a new process with behaviour similar to the average between these two processes. So then my question is which variance measure should I combine ? I.e. which should I take: 
(1) $\tilde{\sigma}=\sigma+\hat{\sigma}$, 
(2) $ \tilde{g}=g+\hat{g}$, or 
(3) $\tilde{D}=D+\hat{D}$? The application is not a physical one (in the experimental sense), but I would be happy with a physical reason. Indeed, I think any of the three would produce some kind of combined/average process, but it's not clear which one is the most sensible or natural. My initial thoughts: my most immediate thought is (1), because it is the most ""direct"" to the process. However, if we consider two metrics, it is sensible to add them (i.e. the sum of two metric tensors is still a metric), so perhaps (2) is reasonable as well.","['stochastic-processes', 'partial-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'stochastic-calculus']"

2379613,Counting the amount of desirable colourings,"Inspired by This topic : Let there be $N$ balls in a straight line. We colour them with $m$ $(c_1, c_2,\ldots , c_m)$ different colours. Determine the probability there exists at least one streak of monochromatic balls of at least length $1\leq k\leq N$. The real question here is, how do we count how many of the colourings are desirable to us and how many there are in total. For instance, pick $N=5, m=2$ (equal probability), $k=3$.
With two colours, there should be $2^5 = 32$ different colourings. EDIT: Thanks Arthur $5$ ways for three consecutive to occur, $2$ ways for four consecutives and $1$ way of five consecutives. By symmetry, there should be $16$ desirable choices. With some modifications we can also work out the solution if the colourings had different probabilities. Question: How do we count desirable choices when $N=100, m=2$ (equal probability) and $k = 5$?

2379637,Expected length of runs in a binary string,"Question This is a math of the Introduction to Probability Models (11th edition) written by Sheldon M Ross. Runs of 0s or 1s follow a geometric distribution. The solution I found in the solution manual: Answer Here conditioning has been applied on the first bit. So E[L1|X = 0] should be (1/p) - 1 , as the expected value of a geometric random variable is 1/p (where p is the probability of success). Here the expected length of first run given that first bit is zero is 1/p ""including the first 1 after the run of zeroes"". So I have written (1/p) - 1 , excluding the first 1 after the run of zeroes. But in the solution manual, it is (1/p). Am I missing something? If I think somewhat different (not conditioning on the first bit), the first run can contain either all os or all 1s. If it contains all 0s, the expected length should be (1/p) - 1 or (1-p)/p , and if it contains all 1s, the expected length should be 1/(1-p) - 1 or p/(1-p) . In the first case, the success of a geometric random variable is characterized by the presence of a 1 after the first run ends. Same type of logic applies for the run of 1s. Then my solution matches with the solution of the picture. Can anyone please point out what I am missing?",['probability']
2379644,Number of all subspaces of a vector space over a finite field,"Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. We know that the number of $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$ is given by the $q$-binomial coefficient $$\binom{n}{k}_q = \frac{(q^n-1) \cdots (q^n-q^{k-1})}{(q^k-1) \cdots (q^k-q^{k-1})}.$$
What can we say about the number of all subspaces of $V$, which is thus given by
$$s(n,q) := \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}_q~?$$
This is a polynomial in  $q$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{N}$. Is there are more concrete description? I already know that the coefficients count certain partitions, but I am not so much interested in the coefficients than in a closed or computable form. Can we write $s(n,q)$ as a sort of $q$-analog of a power of $2$? (In the limit case $q \to 1$, we will get $2^n$.) Is there a recurrence relation? Do these numbers have a name? It is tempting to use the $q$-binomial theorem, which states
$$(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}_q x^k y^{n-k}$$
in the ring $\mathbb{Z}\langle x,y : yx=q xy \rangle$. But we cannot simply plug in $x=y=1$ here, since this does not define a ring homomorphism. Here are some examples: $s(0,q)=1\\

2379677,Number of samples needed before sample maximum greater than some value,"Let's say you have a standard normal distribution, and you are sampling from this $N$ times. How many samples will it take before the maximum observed value will be at least 3 (or in general some value $K$)? To solve this problem I considered the CDF of the normal distribution for when $x >= 3 $. This gives that the probability of finding a value of $x >= 3$ in one sample is $0.0013499$. Since we know all our samples are independent of each other, the answer would appear to be the mean of the geometric distribution that results with $p=0.0013499$, which is $740.97$. However, by simulating a large number of trials I found that the true answer is around 444 trials. (Here's the mathematica code to show this Table[Table[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[]], {x, 1, 444}] // 
   Max, {k, 1, 1000}] // Mean This can also be verified mathematically by solving the reverse problem: the expected sample maximum from $N$ trials. Note that $[Pr(x <= K)]^{444}$ — the probability that the results from all 444 trials are less than k — constitutes a CDF for all 444 trials. From this the corresponding PDF (albeit in terms of Erf function) can be found by differentiating, and finding the expected value of this PDF (or letting mathematica approximate the integral numerically) indeed gives that 444 trials is sufficient to have an expected sample maximum of 3. So why did my attempt to solve the problem overshoot the answer?","['statistics', 'probability', 'density-function']"

Clearly, $c = x+t$ for some $0<t<1$ , so $f'(c) = f'(x+t)$ , so $\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f'(c) = \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f'(x+t)$ .
