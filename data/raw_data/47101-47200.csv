473684,Harmonic maps from the sphere,"In Hamilton's 1997 paper on four-manifolds with positive isotropic curvature, he 
considers a local diffeomorphism of Riemannian $n$-manifolds $$ P: (N,\bar g) \to (M, g). $$ Such a map is harmonic if $$ 
\operatorname{tr}_{\bar g} \nabla d P^\alpha = \bar g^{jk} \left( 
\frac{\partial P^\alpha}{\partial x^j \partial x^k} + 
\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^\alpha \frac{\partial P^\mu}{\partial x^j} \frac{\partial P^\nu}{\partial x^k} - 
\bar \Gamma^l_{jk} \frac{\partial P^\alpha}{\partial x^l} \right) = 0
$$ where $\Gamma$ is the Levi-Civita connection of the pullback metric $ P^* g $. He then claims that when $(N, \bar g)$ is the round sphere $S^n$, this is equivalent to 
$$ \bar g^{jk} ( \bar\Gamma_{jk}^i - \Gamma_{jk}^i ) =0.$$ There must be some property of the connection on the round sphere that makes this work, but I'm not seeing it - any pointers? Also, in the first formula for the Laplacian I gave above, $\Gamma$ is usually interpreted as the pullback connection on $P^* TM$ (which I have given Greek indices) - this works in more general cases than when $P$ is a local diffeomorphism. Am I correct that in this case both interpretations give the same result?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
473698,"Showing that a set is complete in $L^2[0, \, \pi/2]$","I'm trying to show that the set $S = \{ \sin((2n - 1)x)\}$ for $n = 1, 2, \dots $ forms a complete system for the Hilbert space $L^2[0, \, \pi/2]$. In other words I have to show that if $f \in L^2[0, \, \pi/2]$ satisfies $$\langle f , \, \sin((2n - 1)x) \rangle = \int_0^{\pi/2} f(x) \sin((2n - 1)x) = 0$$ for all $ n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $f = 0 $. One idea I have heard is to use the fact that $\{e^{i n x}\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} $ is a complete system for $L^2[-\pi, \, \pi]$. I think the idea is to extend the function $f$ to the interval $[-\pi, \, \pi]$ somehow, and use the completeness of the set $\{e^{i n x}\}$. I'm not entirely sure of the details however. So I guess my question is, how can we use the completeness of $\{e^{i n x}\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} $ on $[-\pi, \, \pi]$ to show completeness of $\{\sin((2n - 1)x)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ on $[0, \, \pi/2]$? Specifically why is it only the odd positive values of $n$ that are left over when going from $[-\pi, \, \pi]$ to $[0, \, \pi/2]$? Also, out of curiosity, is there an ""easy"" way to do this question from scratch (i.e., without relying on the fact that $\{e^{i n  x}\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} $ is a complete system)?",['functional-analysis']

473800,Proof that the integers have no zero divisors.,"There is a proposition in the Tao's Analysis book in the chapter four. I cannot prove it and I almost sure that should be too easy to do. Definition 1: For any $a,b,c,d\in \mathbb{N}$ we shall write $\langle a,b \rangle \sim \langle c,d \rangle \iff a+_{\mathbb{N}}d=b+_{\mathbb{N}}c$ Definition 2: The sum of two integers $\langle a,b \rangle +_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle c,d \rangle$ is defined by the formula:
$\langle a,b \rangle +_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle c,d \rangle:= \langle a+_{\mathbb{N}}c\,,\,b+_{\mathbb{N}}d\rangle $. The product of two integers  $\langle a,b \rangle \cdot_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle c,d \rangle:= \langle\, a\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}b\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d\,,\, b\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}a\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d\, \rangle. $ Lemma 1: Addition and multiplication are well-defined. Proof: Suppose that $\langle a,b\rangle,\langle a',b'\rangle,\langle
 c,d\rangle, \langle c',d'\rangle \in \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ and
  that $\langle a,b\rangle \sim \langle a',b'\rangle$, $\langle
 c,d\rangle \sim \langle c',d'\rangle$. Addition : We need to prove that $\langle a,b\rangle +_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle
 c,d\rangle \sim \langle a',b'\rangle +_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle
 c,d\rangle $. $\langle a,b\rangle +_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle
 c,d\rangle \sim \langle a+_{\mathbb{N}}c\,,\,b+_{\mathbb{N}}d \rangle$ and $\langle a',b'\rangle +_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle
 c,d\rangle \sim \langle a'+_{\mathbb{N}}c\,,\,b'+_{\mathbb{N}}d \rangle$. Thus we need to show that $a+_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}b'+_{\mathbb{N}}d = b+_{\mathbb{N}}d+_{\mathbb{N}}a'+_{\mathbb{N}}c$. But since $\langle a,b\rangle \sim \langle a',b'\rangle$, i.e, $a+_{\mathbb{N}}b'=a'+_{\mathbb{N}}b$ and so by adding $c+_{\mathbb{N}}d$ we obtain the claim. Product : Similarly we need to prove that $\langle a,b\rangle \cdot_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle
 c,d\rangle \sim \langle a',b'\rangle \cdot_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle
 c,d\rangle $. $\langle a,b\rangle \cdot_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle
 c,d\rangle \sim \langle\, a\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}b\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d\,,\, b\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}a\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d\, \rangle$ and $\langle a',b'\rangle \cdot_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle
 c,d\rangle \sim \langle\, a'\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}b'\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d\,,\, b'\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}a'\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d\, \rangle$ Then we need to show that: $a\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}b\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d+_{\mathbb{N}}b'\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}a'\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d=a'\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}b'\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d+_{\mathbb{N}}b\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}c+_{\mathbb{N}}a\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}d$
  $\:\:\:\:\;\;\,c\cdot_{\mathbb{N}} \left( a+_{\mathbb{N}} b'\right)+_{\mathbb{N}} d\cdot_{\mathbb{N}} \left(a'+_{\mathbb{N}} b \right)=c\cdot_{\mathbb{N}} \left( a'+_{\mathbb{N}} b\right)+_{\mathbb{N}} d\cdot_{\mathbb{N}} \left(a+_{\mathbb{N}} b' \right)$ But since $a+_{\mathbb{N}}b'=a'+_{\mathbb{N}}b$ clearly LHS = RHS . The other two identities can be proved with symmetric arguments. $\,\,\;\square$ Definition 3 : Given a natural number $n$ the corresponding integer is $n_{\mathbb{Z}}$ defined by the formula $n_{\mathbb{Z}}:=\langle\, n,0\,\rangle$ (For simplicity let's use ""$+$"" for""$+_{\mathbb{N}}$"" and ""$\cdot$"" for ""$\cdot_{\mathbb{N}}$"" and $=_{\mathbb{Z}}$ for $\sim$. Proposition : Let $x$ and $y$ be integers such that $x \cdot_{\mathbb{Z}} y =_{\mathbb{Z}}0_{\mathbb{Z}}.$ Then either $x=_{\mathbb{Z}}0_{\mathbb{Z}}$ or $y=_{\mathbb{Z}}0_{\mathbb{Z}}$ or both. Proof: For the sake of the contradiction suppose that $x\not=_{\mathbb{Z}}0_{\mathbb{Z}}$ and  $y\not=_{\mathbb{Z}}0_{\mathbb{Z}}$. Let $x$ be the ordered pair $\langle a,b \rangle$ and $y$ be $\langle c,d \rangle$, where $a,b,c,d\in \mathbb{N}$. Claim 1 : $\langle e,f \rangle \not=_{\mathbb{Z}}0_{\mathbb{Z}}\iff e\not=f$ Proof of the Claim 1: ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $e=f$. Clearly $\,e+0=f+0$ and so $\langle e,f \rangle =_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle\, 0,0\,\rangle =_{\mathbb{Z}}0_{\mathbb{Z}}$. ($\Leftarrow$) Now suppose $\langle e,f \rangle  =_{\mathbb{Z}}0_{\mathbb{Z}}$. So $\,e+0=f+0$ and then $\,e=f$ as desired. $\,\,\square$ Then by claim 1, $a\not=b$ and $c\not=d$. $\langle a,b \rangle \cdot_{\mathbb{Z}} \langle\, c,d \rangle = \langle a\cdot c+b\cdot d\,,\,b\cdot c+a\cdot d \,\rangle = 0_{\mathbb{Z}}$ So, $ a\cdot c+b\cdot d = b\cdot c+a\cdot d$ And here is where I'm stuck. I thought that maybe I could use the the trichotomy of ordered for natural numbers and analyze that each case entails a contradiction but it is really a mess. So, my question is: what do you think is the clever way to do that? Really would appreciate a help. Thanks.","['self-learning', 'abstract-algebra']"
473826,Structures on spaces of topologies,"Does there exist a fruitful notion of ""moduli space of topologies""?

473853,Prove that $n+1$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ cannot be linearly independent,"I was looking for a short snazzy proof on the following statement: n+1 vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ cannot be linearly independent A student of mine asked this today morning and I couldn't come up with a proof solely from the definition of linear independence . From a higher level perspective, I explained that if I put the vectors in a matrix then if the only null space entry is the zero vector, then the vectors are independent but since we have one extra column than row and that the row and column rank are equal, there is no way we can have $n+1$ as the rank of the matrix and hence from Rank-Nullity theorem, the dimension of the Nullspace is at least one which implies that there is a combination of the vectors where not all the scalar multiples in the definition are 0 but yet we get a zero as the linear combination.

473854,Is it possible to do calculus on any field with a topology?,"I'll try to make my point clear: when we consider the field of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ we can do calculus there because we have properties of a field and in the same time we have a topology to define limits. So, we have a metric given by the norm and so we can construct a basis for a topology using this metric and everything works fine. Since $\mathbb{C}$ is a field, then we can define algebraic functions like $f : \mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}$ given by $f(z)=z^k$ and the properties of the field together with the definition of limit implies that we can define a derivative $f'(z)=kz^{k-1}$. Integration seems more complicated and requiring more structure because we integrate differential forms, so we must be able to talk about them. My question is: if $F$ is any field and if $\tau$ is a topology on $F$, can we define a differential calculus exactly as we do with $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$? My thought was that the only true requirement was that the we need a metric and that $(F,d)$ should be complete, but I can be totally wrong. Is just possible to do differential calculus like we do with $\mathbb{C}$ in $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ in any field endowed with a metric or this just works in those two specific fields?

473855,Proof of inverse function theorem by approximation property,"In proving the inverse function theorem using the approximation characterization of the derivative, we are given $F:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $$F(p_0 + h) - F(p_0) = DF_{p_0}(h) + o(\|h\|).$$ Applying $(DF_{p_0})^{-1}$ to both sides, we get $$(DF_{p_0})^{-1}(\eta) = h + (DF_{p_0})^{-1}(o(\|h\|))$$ $$\Rightarrow F^{-1}(q_0 + \eta)-F^{-1}(q_0) = (DF_{p_0})^{-1}(\eta) - (DF_{p_0})^{-1}(o(\|h\|)), \tag{1}$$ where $F(p_0) = q_0$ and $F(p_0 + h) - F(p_0) = \eta$. The proof is over if we can show that $(DF_{p_0})^{-1}(o(\|h\|)) = o(\|\eta\|)$. My Question: Is the following proof that $(DF_{p_0})^{-1}(o(\|h\|)) = o(\|\eta\|)$ correct? Because $(DF_{p_0})^{-1}$ is invertible, we have for all $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ $\exists m, M>0$ s.t. $$m \|x\| \leq \| (DF_{p_0})^{-1} (x) \| \leq M \|x\|.$$ Now $(1)$ implies that $$(DF_{p_0})^{-1}(\eta) = h + (DF_{p_0})^{-1}(o(\|h\|)) \\ \Rightarrow M\|\eta\| \geq \|h\| - M \epsilon \|h\| \\ \Rightarrow \frac {M \|\eta\|} {1 - M\epsilon} \geq \|h\|$$ So $\|h\| = O(\|\eta\|)$. (Here we've chosen $h$ small enough so that $|o(h)| \leq \epsilon \|h\|.$) Now $$(DF_{p_0})^{-1}(o(\|h\|)) \leq M(o(\|h\|))= M(o(O(\|\eta\|)))=o(\|\eta\|).$$ Does that work?","['multivariable-calculus', 'proof-verification']"

According to the ""encyclopedia of maths"" , every finitely-generated Fuchsian group of the second kind is ""topologically isomorphic (as a group of the disc) to a finitely-generated Fuchsian group of the first kind"". Now, this makes absolutely no sense to me. The disc is referring to viewing Fuchsian groups as transformations of the unit disc onto the complex plane.

The existence of such an $A$ was proven in $1947$. I know little about number theory, but I am curious as to why the power of $3$ is chosen in the exponent. It seems likely that this is purely because $3$ is the smallest and thus in a sense, simplest, odd prime - though this is total speculation on my part. I have two, somewhat related questions: If $p_k$ is the $k^{\text{th}}$ odd prime, does there exist $Q_k\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $\lfloor Q_k^{p_k^n}\rfloor$ is prime for all $n?$ Why would a power of $2$ not work?$^*$ Or in other words, why is there no $Q$ such that $\lfloor Q^{2^n}\rfloor$ is prime for all $n?$ $^*$ I have made an assumption here which may be false, do no hesitate to correct if so.","['prime-numbers', 'exponentiation', 'number-theory']"
474008,Law of large numbers with weights,"Let $X_1 , X_2 , ...$ be an iid sequence with mean 0 and finite variance. Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence of non-random real numbers. Under what conditions on $(a_n)$ do the weighted means $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j X_j$ converge almost surely to 0? The law of large numbers tells us that this will be the case if $a_j = 1$ for each $j$. By scaling the same is true if each $a_j$ is equal to the same constant $c$. Furthermore, if $c \leq a_j \leq C$ for each $j$, then we have $$   \frac{c}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j X_j   \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j X_j \leq \frac{C}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j X_j $$ and the left and right sides tend to 0 a.s. So, the statement is true if the $a_j$'s all belong to some finite interval. However, it strikes me as unlikely to be true if the $a_j$'s grow too rapidly.

and
$d/R = R/d_p$ which can be easily solved for $d_p$ and $q_p$. My question is the following: Why can't I solve the equation starting from the first equation? The first equation is zero if we chose $q_p = -q$ and $d_p = d$. That solution doesn't make a lot of sense physically (it basically means putting to charges with opposing charges on top of each other), but why is it wrong mathematically? Or why do I lose solutions when I do it that way? I hope someone can help. Cheers edit: Physical context is the following: You have a charge on the $z$-Axis at distance $d$ to the origin. It has charge $q$. Around the origin is a conducting half-sphere of radius $R$. Since it is conducting, its potential on the surface has to be zero. To get the field in the space outside of the sphere we can use the method of image charges and place an image charge inside the sphere, such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. This condition is the one written above. The superposition of two point charges has to be zero at $|\vec{x}| = R.$ $q_p$ is the charge of the image charge, and $d_p$ is its position on the z-Axis. edit#2: The potential of a pointcharge at position $\vec{r}'$ is given by: $\phi(\vec{r}) = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}'|}$","['algebra-precalculus', 'physics']"

474223,Eigenvalues of Multiplication in algebraic number field,"Finally I have a new question which is puzzling me. I am currently reading a manuscript so there is no reference or link I can provide. I will try to put all the information needed in here. This implies that I hear several definitions for the first time while reading, which on the other hand is assumed and unless I provide references the idea is that everything needed should be obtainable from what is mentioned within the post. Question 1: (too general) Let $\mathbb{K}$ be an algebraic number field, i.e. $\mathbb{Q}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{K}$ with $[\mathbb{K}:\mathbb{Q}]=:d<\infty$. Let $b\in\mathbb{K}$ and define $\phi(b)(x):=bx$ for all $x\in\mathbb{K}$. Then $\phi(b)\in\operatorname{End}(\mathbb{Q}^{[\mathbb{K}:\mathbb{Q}]})$. What are the Eigenvalues of $\phi(b)$ (i.e. the roots of the characteristic polynomial)? What have I got: As $\mathbb{K}$ is an algebraic number field, we know that $\mathbb{K}\cong\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ for some number algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ and that for $m\in\mathbb{Q}[z]$ the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$. Letting $\zeta_{1},\ldots,\zeta_{r}$ the real roots of $m$ and $\zeta_{r+1},\overline{\zeta_{r+1}},\ldots,\zeta_{r+s},\overline{\zeta_{r+s}}$ the complex roots of $m$, we know that $\alpha$ is an annihilator of the characteristic polynomial of $\phi(\alpha)$ and hence the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial and hence $m$ being separable over $\mathbb{Q}$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-multiple of the charcteristic polynomial for reasons of dimension. This argument holds for all roots of $m$. What is the issue: In the manuscript at hand we start off with an element $\zeta\in\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ (or $\mathbb{K}$ - as you prefer) satisfying some more restraints: There is a subring $\mathcal{O}\subseteq \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ such that as an additive group $\mathcal{O}\cong\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ (as $d=[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}]$ and the base field is $\mathbb{Q}$, this implies that $\mathcal{O}$ is a lattice in the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$). $\mathcal{O}$ is called an order - I am not sure whether this agrees with the standard definition of an order (one sometimes sees the requirement that $1\in\mathcal{O}$ which doesn't follow automatically from this definition). Now the manuscript claims that for $b\in\mathcal{O}$ the eigenvalues of $\phi(b)$ are also given by the roots of $m$. I am not sure but this seems odd to me. If we let $b=0$ then the eigenvalues are all zero. If $1\in\mathcal{O}$, then for $b=1$ the eigenvalues are all 1. Can we say something about the group of units, i.e. if $b\in\mathcal{O}^{\times}=\{o\in\mathcal{O};\exists p\in\mathcal{O}:op=1\}$? Question 2: Is there a way to identify the elements $b\in\mathcal{O}$ such that $\phi(b)$ has the roots of $m$ as eigenvalues?","['linear-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

I can understand the proof of this theorem, except the fact that I don't see how Krull's theorem gives rise to a Zariski open neighborhood (of the formal neighborhood) of the cusp. To my understanding I'm given a modular form $f$ that has zero expansion, i.e. there is a section $f$ of (some $k$-th power of) the canonical line bundle $\omega$ which identically vanishes when restricting $f$ to the formal neighborhood (of the cusp). Since (after restricting) I'm local the bundle is trivial and I can interpret the section $f$ of $\omega$ as section of the structure sheaf of the completion and I know that it is zero here. So since I already know that it the restriction of $f$ is zero, I do not have to argue using Krull's theorem. Am I missing something here?

474346,"Convergence of $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sin p(x)\,dx$ where $p$ is a polynomial with $\deg p>1$","I thought about this problem today, and tried to solve it. Let $ax^n$ be the leading term of $p$. I can prove that $\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sin ax^n\,dx$ converges (below), and I argued that since $p(x)\sim ax^n$ for sufficiently large $x$, we have $\sin p(x)\sim \sin ax^n$, and so the convergence of $\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sin p(x)\,dx$ is determined by that of $\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sin ax^n\,dx$. I am not sure whether this is correct though, and would appreciate some help if it is not. Many thanks! $n>1$ throughout. Call $ax^n$ the leading term of $p$. For sufficiently large $x,\;p(x)\sim ax^n$, and thus $\sin p(x)\sim \sin ax^n$ Without loss of generality, assume $a>0$ and restrict ourselves to $\mathbb{R}^+$. It is sufficient to consider: $$\int_{0}^{\infty} \sin ax^n\,dx$$ For this, let $t=ax^n:$ $$ \int_0^{\infty} \sin x^n\,dx=\frac{1}{\sqrt[n]{a}n}\int_0^{ \infty} t^{\frac{1}{n}-1}\sin t\,dt$$ Now, break up the real line into segments of length $\pi,$ and let $t=w+k\pi:$ $$\sum_{k\geq 0} \frac{1}{\sqrt[n]{a}n} \int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t^{\frac{1}{n}-1}\sin t\,dt=\sum_{k\geq 0} \frac{(-1)^k}{\sqrt[n]{a}n}\underbrace{\int_0^{\pi}\frac{\sin w}{(w+k\pi)^{ 1-\frac{1}{n}}}\,dw}_{s_k}$$
We now work our way towards the Leibniz test: $$0<s_k<\int_0^{\pi}\frac{dw}{(w+k\pi)^{1-\frac{1}{n}}}=n\sqrt[n]{\pi}\Big((k+1)^{\frac{1}{n}}-k^{\frac{1}{n}}\Big)\to 0\;\;\text{as}\;k\to \infty$$ And of course, since $\sin w>0$ for $w\in (0,\pi):$ $$\Big(w+(k+1)\pi\Big)^{\frac{1}{n}-1}<\Big(w+k\pi\Big)^{\frac{1}{n}-1}\Rightarrow s_{k+1}<s_k$$ Thus $s_k$ is a null sequence and is monotonically decreasing hence $ \displaystyle\sum_{k\geq 0} (-1)^k s_k$ converges, and it follows that the integral in question converges also.","['definite-integrals', 'convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'integration']"
474353,Continuity of the adjoint map in various operator topologies,"I am currently reading about operator topologies in the book ""Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics: Functional Analysis"" by Reed and Simon. In their treatment of the Hilbert space adjoint, a theorem (Theorem VI.3) states that the adjoint map $T \mapsto T^*$ is always continuous in the weak and uniform topology, but is continuous in the strong operator topology only if the Hilbert space is finite-dimensional. However, a previous comment (p.184) states that the weak operator topology is weaker than the strong operator topology which in turn is weaker than the uniform topology. Doesn't this mean that the continuity of the adjoint map in the uniform operator topology implies its continuity in the strong operator topology? Unfortunately the proof for the theorem above is not really helpful for the beginner because it states that continuity in the uniform and weak topology are trivial. An accessible counterexample, however, is provided to demonstrate the case where continuity in the strong operator topology fails.

In such a case, $L_X = \iota_X^{-1}(\iota_H(H) \cap \iota_K(K))$ is a normal subgroup of $X$ and $\phi:L_H \to L_K : h \mapsto \iota_K^{-1}( \iota_H(h))$ is an isomorphism. So given groups $H,K$; normal subgroups $L_H \lhd H$, $L_K \lhd K$; and an isomorphism $\phi:L_H \to L_K$ what more is needed in order to describe a normal product $(\iota_H,\iota_K,G)$ up to some obvious sense of isomorphism? If $L_H=L_K=1$, then there is only one possible $\phi$ and all $(\iota_H,\iota_K,G)$ are isomorphic to $(\iota_1,\iota_2,H\times K)$. Hence the issue really is what do we need to say about that intersection, $L$. A homomorphism $H \to \operatorname{Aut}(K)$ would be sufficient, but such a homomorphism would have to satisfy a fair number of compatibility conditions to ensure such a normal product existed. Thinking inside $G=HK$, we need to rewrite $kh = h k^h$ and this homomorphism serves to define $k^h$, but if $k \in H \cap K$, then the action of $h$ on $K$ has to agree with the action of $H$ on $H$. Another idea is that we can write $kh = hk[k,h]$ so we just need to describe the somewhat bilinear map $[] : H \times K \to L$, where $L=H \cap K$, and such a map is probably related to derivations in some reasonable way.

474450,The counted is to the countable as the ??? is to the (order)-isomorphic.,"We sometimes need to distinguish the counted from the countable. A counted set is a set equipped with a particular bijection into (some of) the natural numbers; a set is countable if there exists such a bijection. One way the difference shows up: to show that union of countable sets $X_i$ is countable you need some choice; not so to show that union of counted sets $X_i$ is countable. [I learnt this way of talking from Thomas Forster, who got it from John Conway. And I'm reminded of this by a very recent comment here to a question about Proving existence of a surjection $2^{\aleph_0} \to \aleph_1$ without AC , where Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine says ""This is fairly standard terminology for working with countability without choice"".] OK, here's a further terminological question. There's a parallel distinction to be drawn between the case where we have (say) two ordered sets equipped with a particular order-preserving bijection between them, and the case where we are just given that the two ordered sets are order-isomorphic. Being order-isomorphic (like being countable) is defined in terms of a quantification over bijections. Is there a standard bit of terminology for the corresponding notion (like being counted) where the relevant sets are taken together with a particular bijection? [Of course, there will a distinction like this to be drawn whatever kind of isomorphisms we happen care about.] Added A little context. The notion of being countable, defined as it is in terms of a quantification over functions, might seem to be bit problematic if used in a context where we are being non-committal about what functions are being countenanced (and so non-committal about what the domain of quantification is). Similarly for the notion of being isomorphic, defined as that is in terms of another quantification over functions. But in fact, often we don't have to fuss very much about such matters in the first case, because we are typically interested in the countable-because-actually-counted, i.e. we actually equip the relevant set with a bijection into the numbers. Likewise, we typically establish that two ordered sets are order-isomorphic by actually giving a bijection that is order-preserving: we are interested in the isomorphic-because-actually-....

$$u(z)\cdot\left(-\dfrac{\partial v(z)}{\partial x}\right) + v(z)\cdot\dfrac{\partial u(z)}{\partial x} = 0$$ We can write as a matrix form: $$\begin{pmatrix} u(z) & v(z) \\ v(z) & -u(z)\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial{u(z)}}{\partial{x}}\\\frac{\partial{v(z)}}{\partial{x}}\end{pmatrix} = 0$$ For values of $z$ such that the matrix $A=\begin{pmatrix} u(z) & v(z) \\ v(z) & -u(z)\end{pmatrix}$ is invertible, we get $\dfrac{\partial{u(z)}}{\partial{x}}=\dfrac{\partial{v(z)}}{\partial{x}}=0$. But what can we do for values of $z$ such that the matrix $A$ is not invertible?",['complex-analysis']
474729,Bounded operators with prescribed range,"If $X$ is a seaparable Banach space and $Y$ is a subspace of $X$, not necessarily closed, can one always find an bounded operator with range $Y$?

It seems that the general case is open. https://mathoverflow.net/questions/101253/surjectivity-of-operators-on-linfty Edit 2: If $Y$ is not closed, Jonas Meyer answer below shows that the answer is 'No'.

474733,Derivation of the density function of student t-distribution from this big integral.,"My lecturer posed a question where we derive the density function of the student t-distribution from the Chi-square and Standard normal distribution. I worked on this question for days, and I am pretty sure the below integral is correct (Verified by others) $$f_T(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty|x|2nx\times \frac{\frac{1}{2}^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}(x^2n)^{\frac{n}{2}-1}e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2n}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(xt)^2}{2}}dx$$ where n is the degree of freedom of the t-distribution and $\Gamma$ is the gamma function from the Gamma distribution. My goal is $$f_T(t)=\frac{\Gamma[(n+1)/2]}{\sqrt{n\pi}\Gamma(n/2)}\left(1+\frac{t^2}{n}\right)^{-(n+1)/2}$$ I was given 2 hints. To proceed, I need to do integration by parts first, then I should use the fact that the Gamma d.f integrates to 1. From this point on, I am unsure, but I shall show you my steps. We know that the d.f of the Gamma density with parameters $\alpha=\frac{n+1}{2} \lambda=\frac{1}{2}$ integrates to $1$ , that is $\int_{0}^{\infty}g(t)dt= \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\frac{1}{2}^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}t^{\frac{n+1}{2}-1}e^{-\frac{1}{2}t}dt=1$ Let $t=x^2n$ .  Therefore, $dt=2xn\,dx$ We have $\int_{0}^{\infty}g(t)dt=\int_{0}^{\infty}g(x^2n)2xn\,dx=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\frac{1}{2}^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}(x^2n)^{\frac{n+1}{2}-1}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x^2n)}2xn\,dx=1$ This should be useful because I noticed the $\Gamma[(n+1)/2]$ in the end result. Working on the big integral now... $f_T(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty|x|2nx\times \frac{\frac{1}{2}^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}(x^2n)^{\frac{n}{2}-1}e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2n}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(xt)^2}{2}}$ $=\frac{\Gamma[(n+1]/2)]}{\sqrt{n\pi}\Gamma(n/2)}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\sqrt{n\pi}\Gamma(n/2)}{\Gamma[(n+1]/2)]}|x|2nx\times \frac{\frac{1}{2}^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}(x^2n)^{\frac{n}{2}-1}e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2n}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(xt)^2}{2}}dx$ After a load of manipulation, $=\frac{\Gamma[(n+1]/2)]}{\sqrt{n\pi}\Gamma(n/2)}\int_{-\infty}^\infty 2nx \frac{(\frac{1}{2})^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\Gamma [(n+1)/2)] }(x^2n)^{\frac{n-1}{2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x^2n)}\times2n|x|e^{-\frac{(xt)^2}{2}}dx$ Note that the first half is integrate to 1. Hence I do by parts. But I still cannot get to my goal. I had tried this question for at least 6 times already now. Can I get some help? I tried to type these out as neatly as I knew how.","['definite-integrals', 'normal-distribution', 'probability', 'integration']"
474741,Formula for Combinations With Replacement,"I understand how combinations and permutations work (without replacement). I also see why a permutation of $n$ elements ordered $k$ at a time (with replacement) is equal to $n^{k}$. Through some browsing I've found that the number of combinations with replacement of $n$ items taken $k$ at a time can be expressed as $(\binom{n}{k})$ [this ""double"" set of parentheses is the notation developed by Richard Stanley to convey the idea of combinations with replacement]. Alternatively, $(\binom{n}{k})$ = $\binom{n+k-1}{k}$. This is more familiar notation. Unfortunately, I have not found a clear explanation as to why the above formula applies to the combinations with replacement. Could anyone be so kind to explain how this formula was developed?","['combinations', 'combinatorics']"
474754,$f(z)$ and $\overline{f(\overline{z})}$ simultaneously holomorphic,"Prove that the functions $f(z)$ and $\overline{f(\overline{z})}$ are simultaneously holomorphic. I take this to mean that $f(z)$ is holomorphic if and only if $\overline{f(\overline{z})}$ is holomorphic. Let $g(z)=\overline{f(\overline{z})}$. Note that $\overline{g(\overline{z})}=f(z)$. So it suffices to prove that if $f(z)$ is holomorphic, then $g(z)$ is holomorphic. Write $f(z)=u(z)+iv(z)$. Since $f(z)$ is holomorphic, the real and imaginary parts satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations: $$\frac{\partial{u(z)}}{\partial{x}} = \frac{\partial{v(z)}}{\partial{y}}, \frac{\partial{u(z)}}{\partial{y}} = -\frac{\partial{v(z)}}{\partial{x}}.$$ We have $g(z) = u(\overline{z})+i(-v(\overline{z}))$. To prove that $g(z)$ is holomorphic, we must prove that its real and imaginary parts satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations: $$\frac{\partial{u(\overline{z})}}{\partial{x}} = \frac{\partial{(-v(\overline{z}))}}{\partial{y}}, \frac{\partial{u(\overline{z})}}{\partial{y}} = -\frac{\partial{(-v(\overline{z}))}}{\partial{x}}.$$ How can we obtain this from the above relations?",['complex-analysis']
