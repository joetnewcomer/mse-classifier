513910,Atiyah Macdonald Chapter 3 Problem 23 Part ii),"I am really confused about Atiyah Macdonald chapter 3 problem 23 part ii) The set up: Let $A$ be a ring and $X=\text{Spec}(A)$ be the set of prime ideals of $A$ with the Zariski topology.  Let $U$ be a basic open set, meaning $U=X_f$ for some $f\in A$ where $X_f$ is the set of prime ideals of $A$ that do not contain $f$.  By part i) of the problem the ring $A(U)$ defined by $A(U) = A_f = S^{-1}A$ where $S = \{f^n : n \geq 0 \}$ depends only on $U$ up to the isomorphism $A_f\to A_g$ given by $\frac{a}{f^m}\mapsto\frac{a}{g^m}$ (EDIT: as pointed out below this is not the correct isomorphism, see Ben's answer). Let $U'$ be another basic open set $U'=X_g$ such that $U' \subset U$.  There is an equation of the form $g^n=uf$ where $u\in A$ and $n>0$ since $U'\subset U$ implies $g$ is in the radical of $f$.  Define a ring homomorphism $\rho : A(U)\to A(U')$ given by $\frac{a}{f^m}\mapsto \frac{au^m}{g^{mn}}$.  I am supposed to show that $\rho$ depends only on $U$ and $U'$. First of all, the equation defining $\rho$ is not well defined, so I assume we should choose $n$ to be minimum, although it doesn't say that in the problem.  Second, it is straightforward to check that $\rho$ is a ring homomorphism if it is well defined but I don't see why it is well defined on equivalence classes.  Can this be done using the universal property of $A(U)$?  Lastly, I don't see why $\rho$ depends only on $U$ and $U'$.  I wrote down the obvious commutative diagram and element wise I am not seeing it.  Is there something conceptual here that I am missing?  Any help is appreciated.","['commutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"
513941,Dealing with Residues on the Real Axis - (Evaluation of Improper Integrals) Problem,"Problem Compute $ \int_0^{\infty} \frac{dx}{x^a(x+2)} $, with $a \in \mathbb{R}$, using the Residue Theorem. Find the values of $a$ for which this procedure is valid. Attempt at a solution Looking at this integrand and letting $f(z) = \frac{1}{z^a(z+2)}$, it was/is easy to show that the integral does not converge for $a \le 0$ by just using direct integration via Calculus. For $a>0$, I noticed that there were singularities at $z=0, -2$, both of which lie on the real axis, which means we cannot take the typical approach of the Residue Theorem by considering the upper semicircle $C_R$ and taking $R \to \infty$, etc. The next thing I attempted to consider the region bounded by the quarter half circle $C_{R'}$ with radius $R$ and the positive $Re(z)$ and  $Im(z)$ axis, but also considering a quarter-circle with radius $\epsilon > 0$ about the origin in the same region since I have a singularity there. Contour integral for this region should be zero by Cauchy-Goursat, since the only possible singularity in this region would be at the origin (which I have avoided). However, the computation becomes very messy, and this problem assumed to have no computational tools available when solving. Am I on the right path? Or is there an easier approach to solving this question? I also should note that, based on numerical computations on Mathematica, it seems to be valid for $0 < a < 1$.

514111,"What does $|mK_V|=|M|+F$ mean for linear system $|mK_V|,|M|$?","I apologize for the ambiguity of the title, the question comes from M.Reid's Young persons guide to canonical singularities (p.355), and I saw similar constructions in many other places. In fact this question is more than explanations of notations. Let $V$ be a smooth projective variety of general type. $K_V$ is a canonical divisor of $V$. Reid wrote: Let $V' \to V$ be a resolution of the base locus of $|mK_V|$; in view of the birational invariance of $H^0(mK_V)$, I can replace $V$ by $V'$, so assume that $$|mK_V|=|M|+F,$$ where $|M|$ is a free linear system and $F$ the fixed part. I have three questions: (1) What does $|mK_V|=|M|+F$ mean? I understand it in the following way: Let $F'$ be the base locus of $|mK_V|$, then  $|mK_V|$ defines a morphism $$\phi: V - F' \to \mathbb{P}^N,$$ with the closure of image $\overline{\phi(V-F')}=X$ and let $V'$ be the desingulization of the graph of $\phi$. Thus we have $$V \xleftarrow{q} V' \xrightarrow{p} X.$$ Let $M:=p^*(\mathcal{O}_X(1))$, and $F:=p^{-1}(F')$, then one should have $$M|_{(V'-F)} \cong mK_{V'}|_{(V'-F)}.$$ However, I don't know how to make sense of $|mK_V|=|M|+F$. (2) Why $F$ is a (Weil) divisor? (Moreover, I remember in somewhere it is claimed to be a Cartier divisor). It seems very strange to me that the fixed locus of linear system is a divisor, could it have higher codimension? (3) It seems Reid got $$mK_V \cong \phi^*\mathcal{O}_X(1) + F$$ from above relation, why this is the case?",['algebraic-geometry']
514135,why distribution function is right continuous?,"I'm reading Bernt Oksendal's ""Stochastic Differential Equations"" and this is one of the exercise: 2.2 a) (iii). Let $X:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a randome variable. The distribution function $F$ of $X$ is defined by
$$F(x) = P[X\leq x]$$
a) prove that $F$ has the following properties:
(iii) $F$ is right-continuous, i.e. $F(x) = \lim_{\substack{h\rightarrow 0\\h>0}}F(x+h)$. I'm wondering, if $X$ is defined as:
$$X = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}X_n,$$

514524,Recurrence of a certain class of $2$-$d$ random walks,"As is well known, a symmetric random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (the lattice of $d$ dimensional vectors with integer components) is recurrent if and only if $d=1,2$.

What about a random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, where the probability to move right is equal to the probability to move left, and the probability to move forward is equal to the probability to move backward, but they are not necessary all $0.25$? (They do sum to $1$ of course). Well it turns out that this is recurrent as well. My question is this: Is there a non-computational proof of this? i.e. can one show in some rigorous sense that this is ""the same"" as a truly symmetric $2$-$d$ random walk and thus recurrent? edit: perhaps I should replace ""non computational"" with ""slick"" or ""short"". I was given a problem on an exam that required as a lemma the fact that these walks are recurrent. When I went over the official solution, I was surprised that the lecturer stated without proof that in this type of walk the probability of returning to the origin at time n is of order 1/n, as though this was some immediate corollary of the symmetric case (where this holds).

514569,What is the relation between weak convergence of measures and weak convergence from functional analysis,"To keep things simple, we assume $X$ to be a polish space (think of $X$ as $\mathbb{R}^n$ for example). Let's denote with $P(X)$ the space of all Borel probability measure on $X$. We say $\{\mu_n\}\subset P(X)$ converges weakly to $\mu\in P(X)$, denoted by $\mu_n\Rightarrow \mu$ if $$\int fd\mu_n\to\int fd\mu,\forall f\in C_b(X)$$ where $C_b(X)$ is the space of all bounded continuous real valued functions. Let this definition be seen as the purely probabilistic one. From functional analysis we also have a concept of weak convergence and weak topology. Let $E$ be a Banach space and denote by $E'$ the dual. Then by considering the family $\{\phi_f:f\in E'\}$, where $\phi_f:E\to\mathbb{R}$ is the linear functional $\phi_f(x):=\langle f,x\rangle$, the weak topology on $E$ is the coarsest topology which makes all $\phi_f$ continuous. One can prove $x_n\to x$ weakly (in weak topology) if and only if $\phi_f(x_n)\to\phi(x)$ for all $f\in E'$. Since $X$ is Polish, we have that $P(X)$ is Polish too. Now I can define a continuous linear functional $\phi_f: P(X)\to\mathbb{R}$ for $f\in C_b(X)$ by $$\phi_f(\mu):=\int fd\mu$$ Infact $\phi_f\in P(X)'$. Therefore we have $C_b(X)\subset P(X)'$. My questions are $\textbf{1. Question}$ Is the dual $P(X)'$ known? Is it isomorphic to a well known space? Is $C_b(X)$ a proper subspace? $\textbf{2. Question}$ The notation of weak convergence in the probabilistic sense ($\mu_n\Rightarrow \mu$) is weaker than the weak convergence in the functional analytical sense. What I mean is: If $\mu_n\to\mu$ in the weak toplogy, i.e. $\langle f,\mu_n\rangle \to \langle f,\mu\rangle $ for all $f\in P(X)'$ this implies $\mu_n\Rightarrow \mu$ since $C_b(X)\subset P(X)'$.

514578,What is the homotopy type of the affine space in the Zariski topology..?,"I'm asking this question out of curiosity, as I was unable to come to a conclusion. Consider the affine space over an algebraically closed field, for concreteness we can work with $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Let's restrict ourselves to the closed points, ie. we're working with the spectrum of maximal ideals. What is the homotopy type of this space..? I'd be happy with only knowing the weak homotopy type and I have some suspicion that $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ might be weakly contractible, but I was unable to prove it. Since the Zariski topology $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is strictly weaker than the usual one, it is of course easy to construct homotopies between maps $S^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n}$, as all the homotopies in the usual topology will work. However, the problem lies in the fact that, in principle, there might be simply much more continous maps from the sphere. One might also try to consider the ""radial contraction"" map $r: \mathbb{C}^{n} \times \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n}$ given by $r(v, t) = tv$ which is also continous in the Zariski topology and then restrict that to $\mathbb{C}^{n} \times [0, 1]$ to prove contractibility directly. However, Zariski topology on the product is stronger than the product topology, so it doesn't work. Edit: I have considered the case of $\mathbb{C}$ and it seems it is indeed contractible, but maybe I'm missing something obvious. We're looking for a map $H: \mathbb{C}^{1} \times I \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{1}$ that restricts to the identity on $\mathbb{C}^{1} \times \{ 1 \}$ and to the constant map on $\mathbb{C}^{1} \times \{ 0 \}$. Note that it's enough that the preimages of points are closed, since the closed sets in $\mathbb{C}^{1}$ are finite or the whole space. Choose a bijection $\phi: \mathbb{C}^{1} \times (0, 1) \simeq \mathbb{C}^{1}$ and put $H(z, t) = \phi(z, t)$ for $t \in (0, 1)$. Then the preimage of every in $\mathbb{C}^{1}$ under $H$ is some closed subset of $\mathbb{C}^{1} \times \{ 0, 1 \}$ plus a single point, so it is closed.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"

Suppose not. Let A be an ordinal which does not contain the empty set as an element.
Take $b_1 \in A$. $b_1 \neq \emptyset$ Then by definition of an ordinal we should have $b_2 \in b_1$ and by the same argument we will have $b_3 \in b_2$,...,$b_{n-1} \in b_n$,... so we get an infinite decreasing sequence of elements in $A$, contradicting the fact that $A$ is a well ordered set. am I right? seems suspicious to me since I haven't encountered such a claim...

This “proves” that $n+1$ is not a natural number. I have here, just like Cantor, a formula for a number, rather than a given number. What is the difference between our proofs? It seems to me that the answer is that Cantor’s number (as opposed to mine) is being successively better bounded; the process of moving forward in his enumeration describes a converging series, such as we use to define the real numbers, using Cauchy limits.

Since the difference between the terms applies to all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then we know that it is a Cauchy sequence (specifically, a contractile sequence) where we can assume that $\left| x_2 - x_1 \right|=1 $ then $K = \frac{4}{5} <1$ Also since for large values of $n$, $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} (\frac{4}{5})^n = 0$ so the constant $(\frac{4}{5})^n$ can replace $\varepsilon$ in the criteria for contractive sequence: $\left | x_{n+1} - x_{n}\right| \leq \varepsilon $ Then we can have, $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \left|x_{n+1} - x_{n} \right| = 0$
which is a convergent sequence using the contraction principle. However, it seems like I should have used another method that uses similar idea but explicitly shows that the difference between $\left|x_{n+1}-x_{n} \right| \leq \frac{4}{5}\left|x_{n}-x_{n-1} \right|$ and so on until I get to $\left | x_{n+1} - x_{n}\right| \leq (\frac{4}{5})^n \left| x_2 - x_1 \right|$.
