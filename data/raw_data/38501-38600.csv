375994,Intuition behind conditional expectation when sigma algebra isn't generated by a partition,"I'm struggling with the concept of conditional expectation, when the sigma algebra on which it is conditioned isn't generated by a partition. If $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ is a probability field such that $\mathcal{F}$ is generated by a partition $\Lambda_n$. Then we know that: $E[X|\mathcal{F}]$ = $E_1$$[X|\mathcal{F}]$ $I(\omega \in \Lambda_1)$ +$E_2$$[X|\mathcal{F}]$ $I(\omega \in \Lambda_2)$ + $E_3$$[X|\mathcal{F}]$ $I(\omega \in \Lambda_3)$ + ..... Where $E_i[.]$ is the expectation calculated as per the conditional probability $P(.|\Lambda_i)$ Hence when $\omega$ is in $\Lambda_i$ the conditional expectation gives the expectation of random variable X given that the observed event is $\Lambda_i$ and hence use the modified conditional probability rather than the original one. However this interpretation is only valid as long as the conditioning sigma algebra is generated by a partition. Is there a similar interpretation for a general case? i.e what will it physically represent? Any help will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

376009,Inherited topology of logical Stone's spaces.,"I'm asking here if the following construction is of any interest. I can not find any reference for that kind of thing, so either the subject is completely trivial, either I just don't have the correct terminology to search more about it. Take a first-order $\mathcal L$-theory $T$ (say consistent). Recall that the $n$-th Stone's space is the topological space $S_n(T)$ of all complete $n$-types of any model of $T$ with $(\{p \mid \varphi(\underline x) \in p\})_{\varphi \in \mathcal L-\text{formula}}$ as a basis of open sets. Then I start the construction I talked about : taking a model $\mathcal M \models T$, we have a natural application 
$$f : M^n \to S_n(T),\, \underline m \mapsto \mathrm{typ}^{\mathcal M}(\underline m)$$ 
where $\mathrm{typ}^{\mathcal M}(\underline m) = \{ \varphi(\underline x) \mid \mathcal M \models \varphi(\underline m)\}$ is the type of the element $\underline m \in M^n$. This application $f$ provides a topology for $M^n$, the initial topology with respect to $f$ (that is the smallest topology on $M^n$ making $f$ continuous). Can this topology on the models be used for anything ? For example, it seems that for $n=1$, the topology on $M$ is such that the group of model-theoric automorphisms of $\mathcal M$ is exactly the automorphisms's group of the object $M \stackrel f \to S_n(T)$ in the category $\mathbf{Top} / S_n(T)$.","['general-topology', 'logic', 'terminology', 'model-theory']"
376015,Does $\sum \ln\left(\cos\frac{1}{n}\right)$ converge?,"I want to know whether the series $\sum \log\left(\cos\frac{1}{n}\right)$ converges or diverges. I have made some attempts to solve this problem, and I work out them here: $\cos(2\theta) = 1-2\sin^{2}(\theta)$ So $\cos\frac{1}{n} = 1-2\sin^{2}\left(\frac{1}{2n}\right)$ Now I know that $\log(1-x) = -\left(x + \frac{x^{2}}{2} + \cdots \right)$ Hence what I have with me is $\log\left(1-2\sin^{2}\frac{1}{2n}\right)$ which is I think is less than $2\sin^{2}\frac{1}{2n}$. Hence the series $$\sum\log\left(\cos\frac{1}{n}\right) < 2 \cdot \sum \sin^{2}\frac{1}{2n} < \sum \frac{1}{2n^{2}}$$ and so the series converges.

376027,Confidence intervals and different methods of sampling,"I have two samples collected from the same population, where each sample is collected using a different method of selection, and both samples are large enough for the distribution of the sample distribution of the mean to be normal. Now, when calculating two 95% confidence intervals for the mean, using each of the two samples, I get two non-overlapping intervals, so I can be fairly confident that one of the two samples suggest a larger population mean than the other sample suggest, or in other words, they are suggesting two different population means even-though they are sampled from the same population. So, my question is now, is it valid to conclude that one, or both, of the sampling methods are flawed due to the discrepancy in the population means predicted by the two methods?",['statistics']
376053,Solving an initial value ODE problem using Fourier transform,"I am a physics undergrad and studying some transform methods. The question is as follows: $$y^{\prime \prime} - 2 y^{\prime}+y=\cos{x}\,\,\,\,y(0)=y^{\prime}(0)=0\,\,\, x>0$$ I am having some confusing doing this using Fourier transforms. I took the transform of the entire equations after which i got $\hat{u}=\frac{\mathcal{F}(\cos{x})}{-\xi^2 -2i \xi +1}$ , where $\xi$ is the variable of the Fourier transform of the solution. The solution of the ODE is $$\mathcal{F}^{-1}=\cos{x} \star \mathcal{F}^{-1}(\frac{1}{-\xi^2 -2i \xi +1})$$ where I have used the fact, that the inverse Fourier transform of the product is the convolution. How do I find the inverse transform of the second factor? I know the method of using complex contour integral, and using the residue theorem. Is this the only way? Is there any shorter way in which I can reduce it to the inverse transform of some other function? After calculating the convolution, what do I do? As far as I can see, the problem ends here, but where do I apply the initial condition? EDIT: The source of this problem specifically asks to do it using the Fourier transform method. I have been unable to to solve similiar problems e.g. $$(D^2-2D+5)y=xe^{2x}\,\,\,y(0)=y^{\prime}(0)=0\,,x>0~.$$ I am utterly confused as to what to do with the initial conditions.","['fourier-transform', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'fourier-analysis', 'integral-transforms']"

376055,Prove that the set of integers bounded below is well-ordered.,"Given that we have some $r \in \mathbb{R}$, demonstrate that the set $ S=\{n\in \mathbb{Z} : r\leq n\}$ is well-ordered. I first tried to demonstrate that there exists exactly one integer on the half-open interval $(r,r+1]$ (because I had used that as a Lemma for a previous assignment) and then proceed inductively to show that any subset would admit a least element.  However, that proof required that I assume that $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered.  The point of this assignment is to use this result as a Lemma to prove that $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered, so I cannot use that assumption. It seems obvious to me that the only thing keeping $\mathbb{Z}$ from being well-ordered is that it is unbounded on the negative side. However, seeing that this lower bound eliminates that problem and demonstrating that an arbitrary subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ must admit a least element has proven more difficult for me than I expected.  The level for the question is an undergraduate intro to Set Theory. It turns out the intention of the professor was to have us prove that every non-empty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is well ordered if and only if every descending sequence of that subset stabilizes.  Off to work on that one now.",['elementary-set-theory']

376081,Independence and conditional expectation,"So, it's pretty clear that for independent $X,Y\in L_1(P)$ (with $E(X|Y)=E(X|\sigma(Y))$), we have $E(X|Y)=E(X)$. It is also quite easy to construct an example (for instance, $X=Y=1$) which shows that $E(X|Y)=E(X)$, does not imply independence of $X$ and $Y$. However, since $X,Y$ are independent iff $E(f(X)g(Y))=E(f(X))E(g(Y))$ for all bounded Borel functions $f,g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, does it not make sense that $X$ and $Y$ are independent iff $E(f(X)|Y)=E(f(X))$, again for all bounded Borel functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$? Clearly, one of the implications hold (since $f(X)$ will be independent of $Y$), but what about the other way around? Am I completely wrong in my assessment?","['probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation', 'random-variables', 'independence']"

Attempt: Without that condition on not been able to use the theorem, the question becomes trivial.  Instead: For all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for $n,m \geq N, -\frac{\epsilon}{2} \leq x_n - x_m \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and similar statment for $y_n$. Multiply the above by $y_n$ and the equivalent statement for $y_n$ by $x_m$.  Then add these together.  The result is: $$|x_ny_n - x_my_m| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}(x_m + y_n)$$  I have proved in a previous question that $x_n + y_n$ is Cauchy so could I apply that here and say for $n,m \geq N$, $x_n + y_n$ is Cauchy and hence convergent so tends to a finite limit for $n,m \geq N$.  This would mean my upper bound is a multiple of $\epsilon$ and since $\epsilon$ is arbritarily small, so is this upper bound. Hence Cauchy.

More precisely: I want to know if $I:=\bigcap_{V\in\mathcal{C}} \ker(A\to \mathrm{End}_{S-\textbf{Mod}}(V))$ is the zero ideal. I already know the following facts from the construction of $\mathcal{C}$ and $A$: $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under extension of scalars: If $V\in SA-\textbf{Mod}$ is in $\mathcal{C}$, then $TV$ is in $\mathcal{C}$ for any $S\to T$. $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under direct sums: If $V_i\in SA-\textbf{Mod}$ are in $\mathcal{C}$, then so is $\bigoplus_i V_i$. If $S$ is a field, then $SA-\textbf{Mod}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$. More generally: If $V\in SA-\textbf{Mod}$ is free as an $S$-module and $S$ has the property that projective $S$-modules are always free (like principal ideal domains or local rings) then $V\in\mathcal{C}$. All $V\in\mathcal{C}\cap SA-\textbf{Mod}$ are free as $S$-modules. This suggests to me that $I$ might be contained in $nil(R)A$. Is this true? If it helps, $R$ is an integral domain. More specifically $R=k[v^{\pm 1}]$ oder $R=k[v^{\pm 1}, u^{\pm 1}]$ with $k$ either $\mathbb{Z}[2\cos(\frac{2\pi}{m})]$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$ or some localization of these rings at a small set of prime numbers. $A$ is given by generators and relations (specifically it is a quotient of a path algebra) but I do not know much more about $A$ itself. In particular, I do not know, if $A$ is free as an $R$-module (in which case the answer to my question would be ""yes""). EDIT:
Since I was asked: $SA$ denotes the scalar extension $S \otimes_R A$, $TV$ analogously means $T \otimes_S V$. Johannes Hahn.","['modules', 'ring-theory', 'representation-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

In my physical problem it is valid to make the approximation $t\to 0$ in a certain regime (or more precisely, the approximation that $t$ is very small). So I tried the following: Let us set aside the fact (for now) that this is a sum over odd terms only. So we rewrite the sum as $S=\dfrac{1}{t}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}t\cdot\left(\dfrac{1}{nt}\right)^2\left[1-i\left(nt\right)^2\right]^{-1}$ $\ \ =\dfrac{1}{t}\lim\limits_{t\to 0}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}t\cdot\left(\dfrac{1}{nt}\right)^2\left[1-i\left(nt\right)^2\right]^{-1}$ $\ \ =\dfrac{1}{t}\int\limits_0^\infty\dfrac{1}{x^2}\cdot\dfrac{1}{1-ix^2}\ dx$ (i.e.) setting $t\to dx$ and $nt\to x$ as this resembles a Riemann sum.

If $a,b\in I$ and $E\subseteq [a,b]$ is of Lebesgue measure zero, show that $f(E)$ is a set of Lebesgue measure zero. I think that since $E$ is a set of measure zero for every $\varepsilon>0$, there is a countable covering of $E$ with disjoint open intervals $E\subset \cup_{i\geq 1} U_i$ where $|U_i|=d_i$, so that $\sum_{i=1}m^\ast(U_i)=\sum_{i=1} d_i<\varepsilon$, then:

376827,Quadratic subfield of cyclotomic field [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Unique quadratic subfield of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$ if $p \equiv 1$ $(4)$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ if $p \equiv 3$ $(4)$ (4 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Let $p$ be prime and let $\zeta_p$ be a primitive $p$th root of unity. Consider the quadratic subfield of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$. For instance, for $p=5$ we get the quadratic subfield to be $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt5)$ obtained by the relation between the golden ratio and $\cos(2\pi/5)$ (the minimal polynomial of the golden ratio $\phi$ is $x^2-x-1$ and so the extension is quadratic). Also $\cos(\pi/5)=\phi/2\implies \cos(2\pi/5)=\phi^2/2-1$ by double angle identity. Is it true that in general the quadratic extension is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\pm p})$ where $\pm$ depends on whether $p$ is $1$ or $-1$ $\pmod 4$?

376928,The definition of $p$ capacity of a set $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n$,"I am having a bit of difficult understanding the definition of the $p$-capacity of a set $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ and I was wondering if anyone would be able to clarify whether I have the right idea or not. This is what I understand so far. Formerly the definition of the $p$-capacity of a set is presented as follows. Fix $1\leq p<n$. Define,
\begin{equation}
K^p\equiv\{f:\mathbb{R^n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\ \vert\ f\geq 0, f\in L^{p^{\ast}}(\mathbb{R}^n), Df\in L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^n;\mathbb{R}^n)\}.

\begin{equation}
\text{Cap}_p(A)    \equiv   \inf\left\{\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\vert Df\vert^p\text{ d}x\ \middle|\   f\in K^p, A\subset\text{int}\{f\geq 1\}\right\}
\end{equation}
as the $p$-capacity of $A$ (denoted by Cap$_p(A)$). My thought process on this is as follows: Pick an $f\in K^p$, and look at int$\{f\geq 1\}$. At this point, we ask ourselves : is $A\subset\text{int}\{f\geq 1\}$? If not then repeat step 1. Compute the quantity $\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\vert Df\vert^p\text{ d}x$ Save it in a list $L$. Repeat the process until all possible $f$ from $K^p$ have been considered. Taking the 'smallest' number from the list $L$ defines the $p$-capacity of $A$. Is this a correct way to think about the definition of Cap$_p(A)$? I am aware of the distinction between minimum and infimum which is why I 've put 'smallest' in inverted commas.","['definition', 'geometric-measure-theory', 'partial-differential-equations', 'analysis']"

377015,Weak solution of a non-linear problem with Lipschitz functions,"I'm trying to solve the problem 9.5 in Evans PDE book. The statement goes as follows: Let $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a $\Lambda$-lipschitz bounded function with $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)>\lambda_1$, where $\lambda_1$ is the first eigenvalue of $-\Delta$ on $H_0^1(\Omega)$. We consider the problem $-\Delta u=f(u)$ in $\Omega$, $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$ and $u>0$ in $\Omega$. 
I have to use the method of sub-supersolutions to solve the problem (find a weak solution). My idea is taking as a supersolution the function vanishing on the boundary such that $-\Delta u=M$, where $M$ is a sufficiently big constant. Using the maximum principle this function is positive. The subsolution should be something like the first eigenfunction, which is positive. The problem is that I can't show that it's a subsolution.
It's evident that $\lambda_1<\Lambda$, but the inequalities go in the wrong way in order to show that the first eigenfunction is a subsolution. I can't use Taylor expansion with this Lipschitz function, I only know that $|f(z)|\leq\Lambda|z|$. Any ideas will be appreciated. Thanks","['partial-differential-equations', 'analysis']"
377031,Hartshorne Ex. 1.3.8 - Where do I take intersections here?,"Let $H_i$ and $H_j$ be the hyperplanes in $\Bbb{P}^n$ defined by $x_i = 0$ and $x_j = 0$ with $i \neq j$. I want to show that any regular function on $\Bbb{P}^n - (H_i \cap H_j)$ is constant. Now I think I have the proof in my hands which is the following. My proof: We have
$$\Bbb{P}^n - (H_i \cap H_j) = (\Bbb{P}^n - H_i) \cup (\Bbb{P}^n - H_j).$$
The ring on regular functions on the left hand side should be equal to $\mathcal{O}(\Bbb{P}^n - H_i)  \cap \mathcal{O}(\Bbb{P}^n - H_j)$. We know that $\mathcal{O}(\Bbb{P}^n - H_i) \cong (k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]_{x_i})_0$ and similarly for $x_j$. Thus for any regular function $h $ on $\Bbb{P}^n - (H_i \cap H_j)$, 
$$h = \frac{f}{x_i^k} = \frac{g}{x_j^m}$$
for some $f,g$ homogeneous polynomials respectively of degrees $k$ and $m$. Then by unique factorization and assuming that the fractions are in the lowest terms I conclude $k = m = 0$ so that $h \in k$. My problem: The thing is, taking the intersection of two rings of regular functions requires knowing that they are both embedded into something big. What is this thing? I guess it would be the fraction field of $k[x_q,\ldots,x_n]$. Also, I am worried that my answer in some sense is ""not canonical"" because it requires me to make a choice in embedding the ring of regular functions inside of something.",['algebraic-geometry']

I believe it has to be the following PDE: $$\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}F^{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial F^{2}}\right)dt-rV=0.$$ I know that the PDE of Black-Scholes model is given by: 
$$\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}S^{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial S^{2}}+rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}\right)dt-rV=0.$$ Here you start with geometric Brownian motion process, $dS_{t}=\mu S_{t}dt+\sigma S_{t}dW_{t}$. Further you consider a trading strategy under which one holds one
option and continuously trades in the stock in order to hold some $\Delta$ shares. What I have done so far: Now I start with the process: $dF=\sigma F_{t} dW_{t}$.
By Ito's lemma I have \begin{align}
dV &= \frac{\partial V}{\partial F}dF+\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}dt+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial F^{2}}dF^{2} \\
 &= \frac{\partial V}{\partial F}\sigma F dW+\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}dt+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial F^{2}}(\sigma F dW)^{2} \\
&= \frac{\partial V}{\partial F}\sigma F dW+\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}dt+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial F^{2}}\sigma^{2} F^{2} dt \\
&= \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial F^{2}}\sigma^{2} F^{2}\right)dt+\frac{\partial V}{\partial F}\sigma F dW.
\end{align} Now I make use of the same hedging strategy as in the Black Scholes case so I have:
$$\Pi=V-\Delta F \Rightarrow d\Pi=dV-\Delta dF.$$ So I have:
\begin{align}
d\Pi &= dV-\Delta dF \\
 &= \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial F^{2}}\sigma^{2} F^{2}\right)dt+\frac{\partial V}{\partial F}\sigma F dW-\Delta dF \\
 &= \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial F^{2}}\sigma^{2} F^{2}\right)dt+\frac{\partial V}{\partial F}\sigma F dW-\Delta (\sigma F dW)
\end{align}
Thus:
$$\Delta=\frac{\partial V}{\partial F}$$
Also $d\Pi=r\Pi dt$, so: $$r\Pi dt = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial F^{2}}\sigma^{2} F^{2}\right)dt.$$ Integrating gives: $$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial F^{2}}\sigma^{2} F^{2}-r\Pi = 0$$ Now 
$$\Pi=V-\Delta F=V-\frac{\partial V}{\partial F}F,$$
so we have $$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial F^{2}}\sigma^{2} F^{2}-rV+\frac{\partial V}{\partial F}rF = 0$$ This is the Black-Scholes PDE not Black PDE.
