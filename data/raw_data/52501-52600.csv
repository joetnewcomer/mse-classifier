$\int_0^\infty\left[\frac{1}{2} - \cos\left(x\right)\right]\,{\rm dx \over x}$ I came upon this limit: $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} -Ci(x) + Ci(1/x) +\ln(x)$, is it $\gamma$ ?

549593,Possible Class equation for a group,"Determine the possible class equation for a group of order 21?

549614,Can gluing of morphisms of locally ringed spaces be expressed by an exact sequence?,"Suppose $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)$ are locally ringed spaces. Then morphisms glue , that is, if $\{U_i\}_i$ is an open cover of $X$, then ""to give a morphism $X\to Y$ is the same as giving morphisms $U_i\to Y$ that agree on overlaps"". This sentence is formally similar to the sentence that expresses the condition a presheaf needs to satisfy in order to be a sheaf. So one can try to say that the above sentence can be expressed as: there is an exact sequence $0\to Mor(X,Y)\to \prod_i Mor(U_i, Y)\to \prod_{i,j} Mor(U_i\cap U_j,Y)$ and I have just seen this in a couple of solutions I found online to an exercise in Hungerford. However I can't make sense of this. The first map would be $f\mapsto (f|_{U_i})$, but what would be the second map? The expression $(f_i)\mapsto ((f_i-f_j)|_{U_i\cap U_j})$ doesn't make sense, does it? What does it mean to substract morphisms of ringed spaces? And more importantly, what does exactness of the final arrow mean? Am I missing something obvious? Is there any way around this?",['algebraic-geometry']
549624,"For the sequence $u_n$, $u_n \to +\infty \iff \frac{1}{u_n} \to 0$","Let $u=(u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence such that $u_n \neq 0$ , $u_n \to +\infty$ , for $ n \to +\infty$ . Proof that $u_n \to + \infty , ( n \to +\infty)  \iff \left(( \exists n_0 , \forall n \geq n_0: u_n > 0) \wedge \left(\frac{1}{u_n} \to 0, (n \to +\infty)\right) \right)$ First I want to highlight that Theorem: For any sequence , $b_n >0$ then $b_n \to 0$ iff limit of $\frac{1}{b_n} = \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ is closely (if not completely) analogous to this question. However, the answers given there are 'useless' for me since I'd much rather have someone to verify/falsify my steps. Since the idea of this theorem is very simple and intuitive, I thought that the proof might as well be, however when it comes to applying the rigorous definitions I begin to struggle. My attempt : ""For $ \implies$ "" $u_n \to +\infty$ for big $n$ means that $u_n$ does not converge. In special, the sequence does not converge to $a \in \mathbb{R}$ . Definition (Convergence): Let $u=(u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence and $a \in \mathbb{R}$ . The sequence is convergent and $a \in \mathbb{R}$ is its limit if and only if $\forall \epsilon >, \exists n_0 \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N},(n \geq n_0 \rightarrow |u_n-a|< \epsilon)$ I wanted to use this definition because it's easy to negate, the negation would be: \begin{align}\exists \epsilon >0, \forall n_0 \in \mathbb{N}, \exists n \in \mathbb{N},(n \geq n_0 \wedge |u_n-a| \geq \epsilon) \tag{NOT converge} \end{align} My next step was to play a bit with this expression, especially with the distance, I obtained that: \begin{align}|u_n-a| \geq \epsilon \implies |u_n| \leq \frac{1}{a+\epsilon} \iff |u_n-0|\leq \frac{1}{a+\epsilon} \end{align} with the same quantors as in the negation. Here I could tell that if I choose $\epsilon$ to be very large, then the sequence converges to zero, as desired. However it looks edgy and incomplete to me, would I have to choose for an $\epsilon_1$ and define it such that $|u_n-0| < \epsilon$ turns out? For "" $\Longleftarrow$ "" The sequence $1/u_n$ converges to zero for big $n$ \begin{align} \left| \frac{1}{u_n}-0\right|< \epsilon \implies |u_n| < \frac{1}{\epsilon} \end{align} If $\epsilon$ is small, then the sequence gets very big. I do not see how I could formulate this well in an analytic statement to conclude that $u_n$ must diverge now. Idea (but not worked on yet): Maybe use the contrapositive?","['proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
549632,Properties of $||f||_{\infty}$ - the infinity norm,"Prove that $||f||_{\infty}$ is the smallest of all numbers of the form $\sup\{|g(x)|: x\in X\}$, where $f=g$ ($\mu$ almost everywhere). In addition, if $f$ is a continuous function on the measure space $\mathbb{R}^n,\mathcal{L},\lambda$ (i.e., Lebesgue measure), prove that $||f||_{\infty}=\sup\{|f(x)|:x\in\mathbb{R}^n\}$ Here's the book's definition: $L^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ is the collection of all essentially bounded $\mathcal{M}$-measurable functions on $X$. Moreover, the norm of a function $f\in L^{\infty}$ is the number $$||f||_{\infty}=\inf\{M:|f(x)|\le M\quad \text{for } \mu \text{-almost everywhere  } x\in X\}$$ I think the statement in the second paragraph (i.e., assuming continuity of $f$ on the measure space) is a consequence of the first paragraph.

549635,A $p$-group of order $p^n$ has a normal subgroup of order $p^k$ for each $0\le k \le n$,"This is problem 3 from Hungerford's section about the Sylow theorems. I have already read hints saying to use induction and that $p$-groups always have non-trivial centres, but I'm still confused. This is what I have so far: Suppose $|G| = p^n$. For $k = 0$, $\{e\}$ is a normal subgroup of order $p^0$. Suppose $N_1, ..., N_k$ are normal subgroups of $G$ with orders as described (ie. $|N_i| = p^i$) and $k < n$. $G/N_k$ is a $p$-group, so it has a non-trivial centre $C(G/N_k)$. $\pi^{-1}(C(G/N_k))$ is a subgroup of $G$, where $\pi : G \to G/N_k$ is the quotient map. It is normal in $G$ because $\pi$ is a homomorphism and $C(G/N_k)$ is a normal subgroup of $G/N_k$. I know it contains $N_k$ and some stuff not in $N_k$, so it has to have order at least $p^{k+1}$, but I do not know how to argue it must be equal, or indeed if it even is equal.","['p-groups', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Then $$\mathrm{Pr}(a_1 X_1 + a_2 X_2+\cdots+a_n X_n=c) \neq 1.$$ From here I'm not sure how to proceed.

549674,Classifying complex $2\times 2$ matrices up to similarity,"I would like to prove the following proposition, which is given as an exercise in Hoffman and Kunze: If $A$ is a $2\times 2$ matrix with coefficients in $\mathbb{C}$, then $A$ is similar either to a matrix of the form $\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & b \end{pmatrix}$ or to a matrix of the form $\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 1 & a \end{pmatrix}$. A hint directs the reader to prove that if $N$ is an nilpotent matrix (also in $M_{2}(\mathbb{C})$), then either $N=0$ or $N$ is similar to $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. I have proven this claim (by supposing that $N \neq 0$ and showing that the transformation induced by multiplication by $N$ has matrix representation $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ under a particular basis).

Show that if $A$ and $B$ form a separation of $X-Y$, then $Y \cup A$ and $Y \cup B$ are connected. Attempt at an answer:  since $A,B$ form a separation of $X-Y$ then $X-Y = A \cup B$ and $A \cap B = \emptyset$. Then $X = A \cup B \cup Y = (A\cup Y) \cup (B \cup Y)$, but $X$ is connected hence it must be that $(A \cup Y) \cap ( B \cup Y) \neq \emptyset$, but this must imply that $A \cup Y$ and $B \cup Y$ are connected otherwise $X$ could possibly be disconnected if they are not connected.

549720,Dirichlet Domain of a Fuchsian Group,"Recall that a Fuchsian group is a discrete group $\Gamma \leq PSL(2, \mathbb{R})$ and that a Dirichlet domain for $\Gamma$ is a set $D \subset \mathbb{H}^2$ of the form $$\{z \in \mathbb{H}^2: d(z, p) \leq d(z, \gamma p) \forall \gamma \in \Gamma \}$$ where $p \in \mathbb{H}^2$ is a point not fixed by any element of $\Gamma - e$. Every book I read very casually declares that because $D$ is an intersection of hyperbolic half-planes $\{z : d(z,p) \leq d(z, \gamma p)\}$, D is ""bounded by segments of the geodesics $\{z :d(z,p) = d(z, \gamma p)\}$.""  While this is somewhat clear if this intersection is finite, its not at all clear to me that this is true (or what this even means!) when D cannot be written as a finite intersection of halfplanes. Presumably you want to say something like: ""D is the region bounded by a simple closed curve in $\mathbb{H}^2$ which is comprised of geodesic arcs and arcs along the x-axis"" but I'm not at all sure if thats true or how to prove it.

I've tried a couple of tricks involving taking complex conjugates of both sides of the identity, and trying to relate those back to the original gamma function in some enlightening way.

549806,Any group of order $12$ must contain a normal Sylow subgroup,"This is part of a question from Hungerford's section on Sylow theorems, which is to show that any group with order 12, 28, 56, or 200 has a normal Sylow subgroup. I am just trying the case for $|G| = 12$ first. I have read already that one can't conclude in general that $G$ will have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup or a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, so I am a bit confused on how to prove this. Here is my start, but it's not that far. Let $n_2, n_3$ denote the number of Sylow $2$- and $3$-subgroups, respectively. Then: $n_2 \mid 3$ and $n_2 \equiv 1 (\operatorname{mod } 2)$, so $n_2 = 1$ or $3$. Similarly, $n_3 \mid 4$ and $n_3 \equiv 1 (\operatorname{mod } 3)$, so $n_3 = 1$ or $4$. I was thinking to assume that $n_2 \ne 1$, and prove that in this case, $n_3$ must equal $1$. But I don't see how to do this. One could also do it the other way: if $n_3 \ne 1$, then show $n_2 = 1$.","['sylow-theory', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

550021,Characterization of Convex Polygons,"John Lee's Axiomatic Geometry has an interesting characterization of convex and non-convex vertices for polygons. Let $P$ be a polygon. Consider a ray emanating from a vertex of $P$ which does not intercept any other vertices of $P$. Call the ray inward-pointing when it intersects $P$ an odd number of times. Call it outward-pointing if it intersects $P$ an even number of times. Call a vertex $v$ convex when the set of all inward-pointing rays lies interior to the angle at $v$ and call the vertex concave when the set of all inward-pointing pointing rays lies exterior to the angle at $v$. It can be shown that this definition for vertex convexity is well-defined, i.e. each vertex is either convex or concave. The book asserts the familiar fact that if all vertices of a polygon are convex, then the polygon is convex but does not provide a proof. Does anyone have a proof of this fact using this particular definition of vertex convexity? To provide a definition, a polygon is convex if and only if any of the following holds: it is entirely contained in a closed half-plane defined by each of its edges. for each edge, the vertices not contained in the edge are on the same side of the line the edge defines. the angle at each vertex contains all other vertices in its interior (except the three vertices defining the angle).","['geometry', 'convex-analysis', 'euclidean-geometry']"

  proof:
  use Stolz therom:let
  $$a_{n}=(k+1)(1^k+2^k+\cdots+n^k)-n^{k+1},b_{n}=(k+1)n^k$$
  then
  $$I=\lim_{n\to\infty}\dfrac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\dfrac{a_{n+1}-a_{n}}{b_{n+1}-b_{n}}=\dfrac{1}{k+1}\dfrac{(k+1)(n+1)^k-(n+1)^{k+1}+n^{k+1}}{(n+1)^k-n^k}$$
  so
  $$I=\lim_{n\to\infty}\dfrac{1}{k+1}\dfrac{[k(k+1)/2]n^{k-1}+\cdots+k}{kn^{k-1}+\cdots+1}=\dfrac{1}{2}$$ But for (1),I can't,Thanks.",['limits']

550093,Show that $\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ is generated by 2 and 5.,"In the book ' Of Abstract Algebra ' by Pinter the following question is asked: Show that $\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ is generated by $2$ and $5.\,$ Here, $,\mathbb{Z}_{10}\,$ is defined as the group of residues, mod $10$, with the group operation being addition (mod $10$) as usual. Now I think I understand why this is true and there are probably many ways to show it. First of all I note that:
$$2+2+2+5 \mod 10 \equiv 1$$
Now $1$ is a generator for $\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ because all the elements in $\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ can attained by several repetitions of the group operator on $1.$ Now my question is, is this enough to prove the statement? Also, is it sufficiently rigorous or is there a better way to show the desired results? Thanks a lot in advance :)","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
550107,Show that $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$ is not a cyclic group,"Show that $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$ is not a cyclic group. This question is from the book 'Of Abstract Algebra' by Pinter. Now $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$ containt 8 elements. I found them to be as follows:
$$(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)$$
Now if $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{4}$ were cyclic, one of these elements should be a generator of the entire group. However, for every element listed we find that repeated repetitions of the group operation yields the identity element already before having to apply the group operation eight times. Therefore, using any of these elements as a single element would result in a subgroup of order less than 8, in this case it will have either order 4, order 2 or order 1. Therefore the group is not cyclic. Now I am quite sure this constitutes a correct proof but I am wondering if a more elegant way exist to show this result. This might be especially useful when investigating similar questions for much larger groups. Thanks in advance P.S. I have been posting more questions from this book because I find them very interesting, but I am reading it on my own so I am sometimes unsure if the methods I use are the most elegant and quick.

Let $G$ be the subset of $S_A$ (the symmetric group on $A$) consisting of all the permutations $f$ on $A$ such that $f(x)\in B$ for all $x\in B$. Show that $G$ is a group. The next question asked is now, find an example of an infinite set $A$ where the above conclusion does not hold. I will first present the solution to the first part which i think I solved well, but want to add for completeness SOLUTION FIRST PART Solution: Because $G \subset S_A$ we need only show that $G$ is closed under multiplication (in this case this operation is composition) and closed under inverses. Let $f,g\in G$. Then $g(x) \in B$ for all $x\in B$, say $g(x) = x'\in B$. Now this implies that $f(x') \in B$ because $f\in G$ and $x' \in B$. Thus
$$[f \circ g] (x) \in B$$
And we find that $G$ is closed under the group operation of composition. Now let $f\in G$ again. Certainly $f \in S_A$ and thus $f^{-1} \in S_A$. Now if $x\in B$ we have $f(x)\in B$. Now $f^{-1}(f(x))=x \in B$. Because for every $x \in B$ we have a corresponding unique $x' \in B$ such that $f(x)=x'$, and $f^{-1}(x') = x$ we find that for all $x\in B$ it follows that $f^{-1}(x)\in B$. Thus $G$ is a group. SECOND PART Now what is asked is to find an example of an infinite set $A$ with subset $B$, where $G \subset S_A$ such that $G$ consiststs of permutations $f$ such that $f(x)\in B\quad \forall x\in B$, but where $G$ does not constitute a subset. That is, $G$ is either not closed under composition, or not closed under inverses. I was thinking of using $A=\Bbb R$ and $B=\Bbb R _{\geq0}$ and then considering $f(x)=x^2$ but then I realized that this function is not a permutation because it is not injective or surjective on $\Bbb R$.

  exists.

Im thinking the direct method of proof would work so heres my start:
let a, b be PBAC even integers 
let a = 2m
let b = 2n
the product of 2m and 2n is 4mn
4mn= 2(2mn)
because their both integers, their product must be an integer. Sense we multipling 2mn by 2 it is also even. now lets have one of them be odd:
let a be PBAC even integer
let b be PBAC odd integer
let a = 2m
let b = 2n + 1
the product: 2m(2n +1) = 4mn + 2n = 2(2mn +1)
m and n are integers so the product is an integer. 
adding 1 is also an integer but it is in the form of a multiple of 2, so it is even.
so for a product to be even, and integer must be even
QED?
Is my proof correct? and how would i do this by contradiction/contraposition My attempt at contradiction: Assume the product of two integers a and b are both even. Suppose not that integers a and b are odd
a = (2m + 1)
b = (2n + 1)
let m and n be PBAC integers
ab = (2m + 1)(2n + 1)
ab = 4mn + 2m + 2n +1
ab = 2(2mn + m + n) + 1 Since (2mn + m + n) will be an integer by closure we can conclude that the product ab is an odd integer, which contradicts the assumption.
This means at least one of the integers a or b must be even.

550469,Singularities in (Elementary) Real Algebraic Geometry,"I've taken an introductory course in algebraic geometry, and am currently studying Sumio Watanabe's book, ""Algebraic Geometry and Statistical Learning Theory"".  In this book Watanabe gives a, possibly antiquated, definition of real algebraic singularities: A point $P$ on a curve $A$ is said to be nonsingular if there exist
  open sets $U,V\in\mathbb{R}^d$ containing $P$ and an analytic isomorphism (bijective
  function analytic both ways) $f:U\rightarrow V$ such that $$f(A\cap
 U)=\{(x_1,x_2,...,x_r,0,0,...,0);x_i\in\mathbb{R}\}\cap V,$$ where $r$
  is a nonnegative integer. So to gain some intuition for this definition, I took a look at the two curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$:
\begin{align}
&y^3-x^2=0\\
&x^2-(y+1)^3+(y+1)^2=0.
\end{align} The first of these curves has a singularity at $(0,0)$, while the second one doesn't.  The strategy the book uses in its examples is basically to apply the identity function to $x$, and then project $y$ down onto the $x-$axis, in the following way:
\begin{align}
&f(x,y)=0\\
&u=x\\
&v=f(x,y)
\end{align} Of course this depends on being able to invert the $v=f(x,y)$ function and solve for $y$.  And in fact this is what fails for $y^3-x^2=0$, since solving $v=y^3-x^2$ for $y$ gives us $y=\sqrt[3]{u^2+v}$, which is not analytic at $(0,0)$. So turning to the second equation, which is nonsingular at $(0,0)$, our second analytic function is $v=x^2-(y+1)^3+(y+1)^2$.  Solving this equation for $y$ involves finding the roots of a cubic polynomial, which is not feasible for me.  Thus if this second equation is to be nonsingular, then should I expect that one of these three roots will be a real-valued analytic function inside some open ball containing the origin, while the other two solutions will be complex-valued always with non-zero imaginary part? If not, then how would I go about finding this analytic isomorphism?","['algebraic-geometry', 'singularity-theory']"

550570,The relation between Dirac and Hodge-de Rham operator,"On a spin manifold $M$, we can define Dirac operator
\begin{equation}
D: \Gamma(M,S) \to \Gamma(M,S)
\end{equation}
and in particular $D^-: \Gamma(M,S_-)\to \Gamma(M,S_+)$. Let us consider twist the spin bundle by vector bundle $E$ wit connection, and therefore we obtain twisted Dirac operator $D_E$. Now consider special case where $E = S$ or $E = S_+$. My question is: Is the twisted Dirac operator $D_{E = S}: \Gamma(S\otimes S) \to \Gamma(S\otimes S)$ equal to the usual Hodge-de Rham operator $d + d^*$? (upon identifying $S \otimes S = {\Lambda ^ \bullet }{T^*}M$. Note that if we view $\Lambda^{\bullet}T^*M$ as a Clifford-module, there is a canonical Dirac operator $D|_{\Lambda^\bullet T^*M}$ which is $D|_{\Lambda^\bullet T^*M} = d+d^*$. However, in my limited understanding, I don't know if $D|_{\Lambda^\bullet T^*M} = D_{E = S}$) Is the twisted ${D^ - }:\Gamma ({S_ - } \otimes {S_ + }) = \Gamma \left( {{T^*}M} \right) \to \Gamma (M,{S_ + } \otimes {S_ + }) = \Gamma \left( {\Lambda _ + ^2{T^*}M} \right) \oplus {C^\infty }\left( M \right)$ the same as ${d^*} + {d^ + }$? I tried to prove they are equal. And to do so I ""guessed"" the explicit correspondence between bi-spinors and forms, but the result I obtained turns out to be a mess. Thank you! Edit: Actually the problem boils down to identifying two Clifford multiplications acting on $\wedge^\bullet T^*M\otimes \mathbb{C}$: the 1st one induced from that on $S$ through tensor product, the 2nd one is the canonical multiplication, namely $X \cdot \equiv \sqrt(2)(X\wedge\;\; - \iota_X)$.

But I'm not sure how. How can I proceed here? Proof by contradiction attempt (almost worked) We have to prove that $aRb \land bRa \implies a = b$. Our premise is the fact that $aRb \land bRa$. Suppose that $a \not = b$. Based on our premise, we know that the following occurs:
$$(a = b \lor a = b^2) \land (b = a \lor b = a^2)$$ Since we're supposing that $a \not = b$, it is simplified to $$a = b^2 \land b = a^2$$ Alright, so this is where I'm not sure: since $a \not = b$, can I affirm that the square of either number will always be different from the other number, in $\mathbb{R}?$ Because if that's the case, clearly $a = b^2 \land b = a^2$ won't hold, contradicting the premise, proving that it is indeed antisymmetric.","['relations', 'logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Using Ex. 2, show that $p + q$ maps $\Omega$ in a one-to-one manner onto a region bounded by convex contours. Comments: (i) A closed curve is said to be convex if it intersects every straight line at most twice. (ii) To prove that the image of $C_k$ under $p+q$ is convex we need only show that for every $\alpha$ the function $\Re (p + q)e^{i \alpha}$ takes no value more than twice on $C_k$. But $\Re (p +q)e^{i\alpha}$ differs from $\Re (q \cos \alpha +ip \sin \alpha)$ only by a constant, and the desired conclusion follows by the properties of the mapping function in Ex. 2. (iii) Finally, the argument principle can be used to show that the images of the contours $C_k$ have winding number $0$ with respect to all values of $p+q$. This implies, in particular, that the convex curves lie outside of each other. As a reference, exercise 2 was ${}$2. Show that the function $e^{-i \alpha}(q \cos \alpha +ip \sin \alpha)$ maps $\Omega$ onto a region bounded by inclined slits. Here, $\Omega$ is a a region of finite connectivity, bounded by analytic curves $C_1,C_2, \dots,C_n$. $p: \Omega \to \hat{\mathbb C}$ is a complex meromorphic function, determined by Its only pole is a simple one at $z_0$, with residue 1. Its real part is constant on each of the contours $C_k$. $q: \Omega \to \hat{\mathbb C}$ is similarly determined except its imaginary part is constant on the contours. I've managed to solve Ex. 2 completely, and regarding Ex. 3 I'm stuck at step (iii). Given that the contours $C_k \subset \partial \Omega$ are mapped onto convex contours, how can I prove that all of their images have winding number zero with respect to all values of $p+q$? I guess that the next step is observing that for any $w_0$ taken by $p+q$ we have $$\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \sum_{k=1}^N \oint_{C_k} \frac{p'(z)+q'(z)}{p(z)+q(z)-w_0} \mathrm{d} z=N-P=\text{Ind} \left[(p+q)(\sum_{k=1}^N C_k),w_0 \right] $$ Where $N,P$ are the number of zeros,poles (respectively) of the denominator of the integrand in $\Omega$. However, I can't see how to make progress from here. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks! EDIT: Since my goal is determining the winding number using the argument principle, I believe I should try to evaluate $N-P$: Well, $P=1$ since $p+q-w_0$ has a single simple pole at $z_0 \in \Omega$. And if $w_0$ is taken by $p+q$ then $N \geq 1$. I still cannot see why $N$ can't be strictly greater than $1$ - and even if it isn't, this is only the winding number of the image of the entire boundary, and not of its individual components as asked.","['conformal-geometry', 'complex-analysis', 'analysis']"

I am having problems with two parts of the exercise: 1) proving transitivity and determining the partition. So here's what I've done so far: If a relation $R$ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive then $R$ is an equivalence relation. So I have to prove that $R$ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Reflexivity: Let $n \in \mathbb A$, $nRn \iff nn$ is a square natural number. But $nn=n^2$ which is a square number and is natural by closure of multiplication in $\mathbb N$. Symmetry: Let $n,m$ $\in A$. Suppose $nRm \implies nm$ is a square natural number. But $nm=mn$, which means $mn$ is a square natural number $\implies$ $mRn$. Transitivity: Let $n,m,p \in A$ and suppose $nRm$ and $mRp$, this means $nm=s^2$ and $mp=t^2$. Then $m \vert s^2$ and $m\vert t^2$ so $np=\frac{s^2t^2} {m^2} \in \mathbb N$.

We have to prove that $aRb \lor bRa$, which can be written as: $$(a \le b \lor a = 3b) \lor (b \le a \lor b = 3a)$$ Further simplified: $$(a \le b) \lor (b \le a)$$ Clearly, this should be a tautology. But I'm failing to further simplify this. What else can I do with it?","['relations', 'logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

550949,Probability density function of a summation of continuous random variables,"Let $Z_{i} = \tau + X_{i}$, where $X_{i}$ is a exponential random variable ($X_i \sim \varepsilon(\lambda)$),  $0<\tau, \lambda < \infty$ Assume $X_i$ are independent random variables. Suppose $T_{n} = Z_{1} + Z_{2} + \cdots + Z_{n}$, find the PDF of $T_{n}$, $h(t_n)$. My approach: $T_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left ( \tau + X_{i}   \right )$ $T_{n} = n\tau+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left (X_{i}  \right )$ Let $Y$ be $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left (X_{i}  \right )$, I find the PDF of $Y$, $g(y)$ $T_{n} = n\tau+ Y$ $Y = T_{n} - n\tau$ Using the Jacobian of transformation, I find PDF of $T_{n}$: $h(t_n) = \left | \frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} t_{n}}(t_{n} - n\tau) \right |\times g(t_{n} - n\tau)$ I am stuck on step 3, as I have no idea how to find the PDF of $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left (X_{i}  \right )$. Any ideas? By the way, if there's any wrong with my approach, please say so. Thanks a lot.","['statistics', 'probability']"
