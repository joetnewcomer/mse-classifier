2070505,Expectation of $W(t)e^{\lambda aW(t)}$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : What is $\mathbb{E}[W(s)\mathrm{e}^{W(S)}]$ where W(S) is a standard Brownian Motion? (3 answers) Closed 7 years ago . Let $\{W_t\}_{t \in \mathbb{R}_+}$ be a Wiener process. I wish to calculate $E \left[ W(t)e^{\lambda W(t)} \right], \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. Solution attempt First define a function given by $f(t,x) = xe^{\lambda x}$. Then, \begin{align} 
\frac{\partial f(t,x)}{\partial x} &= e^{\lambda x} +  \lambda x e^{\lambda x}, \\ \frac{ \partial^2 f(t,x)}{\partial x^2} &= 2\lambda e^{\lambda x} + \lambda^2 xe^{\lambda x}.\end{align} So by Ito's formula, the differential of $f(t,W(t))$ is given by \begin{align} df =  \left[  \lambda e^{\lambda W} + \frac{\lambda^2}{2}We^{\lambda W} \right]dt + \left[ e^{\lambda W} + \lambda We^{\lambda W} \right] dW\end{align} Or, rather, $$f_s = f_0 + \int_0^s \left[  \lambda e^{\lambda W} + \frac{\lambda^2}{2}We^{\lambda W} \right]dt + \int_0^s \left[ e^{\lambda W} + \lambda We^{\lambda W} \right] dW.$$
Then we take expectations, so that the stochastic integral disappears, then we define $m(t) = E f_s = E f(s,W(s))$, and then we take the derivatives. We then get $$m'(t) = E \lambda e^{\lambda W} + \frac{\lambda^2}{2}m(t).$$
The first term on the left hand side equals $\lambda e^{t\frac{\lambda^2}{2}}$. At this point, as I am not good with differential equations, I am kind of stuck. And, either way, I would like to have my solution so far checked out as well, as I am unsure whether the stochastic integral really does disappear when I take expectations. What condition needs to be satisfied for this to hold, and how do I check whether it does?","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'stochastic-integrals', 'stochastic-calculus']"

2070559,Solutions for diophantine equation $3^a+n=2^b$,"A few days ago I asked for a solution for $3^a+1=2^b$ where $a\in \Bbb N$ and $b\in \Bbb N$ ( Solutions for diophantine equation $3^a+1=2^b$ ), and I got two good answers for this question. But there I also asked for the more general case $p_1^a+n=p_2^b$ where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are prime and $a,b,n\in \Bbb N$. But this part of my question was ignored, so here I explicitly asks for ways to find solutions for this general case. I still am interested in any $p_1$ and $p_2$, but im very focused on $p_1=3$ and $p_2=2$ because this is part of another problem that I try to solve. I explicitly am interested in solutions for this equations: $3^a+5=2^b$ $3^a+7=2^b$ $3^a+13=2^b$ $3^a+23=2^b$ ... where $a\in \Bbb N$ and $b\in \Bbb N$ and where $b>2$ ($2^b>4$) Supposed that $b>2$, you can show, that in $2^b-3^a \equiv n \pmod{24}$ $n$ only can be $5,7,13$ or $23$ Proof: $2^b \pmod{8}$ is always $0$ when $b>2$; $3^a \pmod{8}$ is always $1$ or $3$; so $2^b-3^a \pmod{8}$ only can be $5$ or $7$. $3^a \pmod{3}$ is always $0$ when $a>0$, but $2^b \pmod{3}$ is never $0$, it's either $1$ or $2$, so also $2^b-3^a \pmod{3}$ only can be $1$ or $2$. Together this leads to the fact, that $2^b-3^a \pmod{24}$ only can be $5,7,13$ or $23$ when $b>2$. qed Knowing this, I was searching for differences $n$ of powers of $2$ minus powers of $3$ having $n<100$ and I found this: $n=5$: $3^1+5=2^3 \rightarrow 3+5=8$ $3^3+5=2^5 \rightarrow 27+5=32$ $n=7$: $3^2+7=2^4 \rightarrow 9+7=16$ $n=13$: $3^1+13=2^4 \rightarrow 3+13=16$ $3^5+13=2^8 \rightarrow 243+13=265$ $n=23$: $3^2+23=2^5 \rightarrow 9+23=32$ $n=29 = 5+24$: $3^1+29=2^5 \rightarrow 3+29=32$ $n=31 = 7+24$: no solution found $n=37 = 13+24$: $3^3+37=2^6 \rightarrow 27+37=64$ $n=47 = 23+24$: $3^4+47=2^7 \rightarrow 81+47=128$ $n=53 = 5+2*24$: no solution found $n=55 = 7+2*24$: $3^2+55=2^6 \rightarrow 9+55=64$ $n=61 = 13+2*24$: $3^1+61=2^6 \rightarrow 3+61=64$ $n=71,77,79,85,95$: no solutions found By comparing any power of 2 up to a certain limit (which was $b \le 2^{10}$) with the biggest powers of 3 being smaller than that power of 2, I found out, that all other differences of powers of 2 minus powers of 3 are bigger than 100 for all $b \le 2^{10}$ which means $2^b \le 1.8 \times 10^{307}$. So the solutions for $n<100$ listed above are the only existing solutions with $3^a$ and $2^b$ having less than 307 decimal digits. And this makes me believe, that there also are no solutions for $n=5,7,13,23,31,...,95$ when $3^a$ and $2^b$ are bigger than $10^{307}$. And I also think, that there is no difference, that appears infinitely often. I even think, that the maximum number that a given difference can appear is 2. But I have no idea how to prove this. Can you help? Are there any other solutions for low values of $n$? If yes: How can you find them? If no: How can you prove that?

I need some verification. My solution/attempt First, we need to prove a theorem. Theorem 1 : If a polynomial function $f(x)$ has a repeated root (say $a$, i.e. $f(a)=0$), then $f'(a)=0$. Proof: We assume that $f(x)$ has a degree of $n \geq 2$.
Since $a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, we can write: $$f(x)=(x-a)^m\cdot h(x) \tag{1}$$
where $2  \leq m \leq n$ and $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n - m$ On differentiating $(1)$, we can write
$$f'(x) = m(x-a)^{m-1}\cdot h(x) + (x-a)^m\cdot h'(x)\tag{2}$$ Plugging in $x=a$, we obtain
$$f'(a)=0+0=0$$ Thus, theorem 1 is true. Now, from the question, we have
$$f(x)=\frac{x^n}{n!}+\frac{x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}+\cdots+x+ 1\tag{3}$$
If we plug in $x=0$, we get $f(0)=1 \neq 0$, for any value of $n$. Hence $0$ is not a root of $f(x)$. On differentiating, we get
$$f'(x)=\frac{x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}+\frac{x^{n-2}}{(n-2)!}+\cdots+x+ 1\tag{4}$$ From $(3)$ and $(4)$, we obtain
$$f(x)-f'(x)=\frac{x^n}{n!} \tag{5}$$ Suppose $c \neq 0$ is a root of $f(x)$. Then from $(4)$, we have $$f'(c)=-\frac{c^n}{n!} \neq 0\tag{6}$$ Hence, from theorem 1 , we can conclude that $f(x)=0$ has no repeated roots. Q.E.D. My question I am a beginner in this field. Did I do all the steps correctly? Are there any points I need to take care of?","['derivatives', 'calculus', 'proof-verification']"
2070918,"""Proving"" the definition of the Laplace Transform from two properties","Suppose $\mathbf{G}$ is the class of piecewise continuous functions of exponential order from $[0,\infty)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ and that $\mathcal{L}$ is a transformation defined on elements of $\mathbf{G}$ satisfying the two properties For $f,\,g\in\mathbf{G}$ and $c_1,\,c_2\in\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{L}\{c_1f+c_2g\}=c_1\mathcal{L}\{f\}+c_2\mathcal{L}\{g\}$ $\mathcal{L}\{f^\prime(t)\}=s\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}-f(0)$ Certain elementary properties of Laplace transforms follow easily from these two. For example: $\mathcal{L}\{0\}$ follows from property ($1$). Let $f(t)=1$ for $t\ge0$. Then $\mathcal{L}\{1^\prime\}=s\mathcal{L}\{1\}-1$ therefore
$$\mathcal{L}\{1\}=\dfrac{1}{s}\tag{1}$$ Using this as a basis step and using property ($2$) to prove that for $n\ge0$
$$ \mathcal{L}\{t^{n+1}\}=\dfrac{s}{n+1}\mathcal{L}\{t^n\}$$
one may establish the inductive step showing that
$$\mathcal{L}\{t^n\}=\dfrac{n!}{s^{n+1}}\tag{2}$$ Also, since property ($2$) gives $\mathcal{L}\{\left(e^{at}\right)^\prime\}=s\mathcal{L}\{e^{at}\}-e^0$ we immediately get $$ \mathcal{L}\{e^{at}\}=\dfrac{1}{s-a}\tag{3}$$ From $\mathcal{L}\{(\cos t)^\prime\}=s\mathcal{L}\{\cos t\}-1$ we obtain $$ \mathcal{L}\{\sin t\}+s\mathcal{L}\{\cos t\}=1$$ and from $\mathcal{L}\{(\sin t)^\prime\}=s\mathcal{L}\{\sin t\}-0$ we obtain $$ s\mathcal{L}\{\sin t\}-\mathcal{L}\{\cos t\}=0$$ And the solution of these two gives $$ \mathcal{L}\{\sin at\}=\dfrac{a}{s^2+a^2}\tag{4}$$ $$ \mathcal{L}\{\cos at\}=\dfrac{s}{s^2+a^2}\tag{5}$$ When I first adopted this approach decades ago in a differential equations class I believed I also had a proof that $$ \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}=\int_0^\infty e^{-st}f(t)\,dt$$ but I cannot recall it so I may have been mistaken.

However, when I apply this to $f(x)=\tan x$, it seems to show that $\tan x$ is continuous, because: For all $a$ in the domain of $\tan x$ (i.e. all real numbers except $\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{2}, n\in \mathbb{Z}$), we have that $\lim_{x\rightarrow a} \tan x$ exists and is equal to $\tan a$ (this can be easily seen from the graph of $\tan x$). So it appears that $\tan x$ is continuous. However, I already know that it isn't continuous at $x=\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{2}$. Does this still mean it is continuous because it agrees with the definition? I'm not sure what to do now. Edit: Really what I meant to ask is the following: Here is the wording in the book: ""A function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=a$, if $f(a)$ is defined and $\lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x)$ is defined and is equal to $f(a)$.

2070983,How to differentiate $G(y)=\ln\left[\frac{(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1/2}}\right]$?,"I'm trying to differentiate the following expression. My work is below. I'm not sure where my algebra has gone awry. Really appreciate any help. The problem is from James Stewart's Calculus Early Transcendentals 7th Ed. Page 223, Exercise 13. Please differentiate:
$G(y)=\ln\left[\frac{(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1/2}}\right]$ My answer: First, differentiate the natural log.
$$G'(y)=\left(\frac{1}{\frac{(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1/2}}}\right)\left(\frac{(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1/2}}\right)'$$ The second term is a quotient rule.
$$G'(y)=\left(\frac{1}{\frac{(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1/2}}}\right)\left(\frac{(2y+1)^5{'}(y^2+1)^{1/2}-(y^2+1)^{1/2}{'}(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1/2*2}}\right)$$ Now differentiate the various terms, and recognize chain rule.
$$(2y+1)^5{'}=(5)(2y+1)^4(2)$$
$$(y^2+1)^{1/2}{'}=(\frac{1}{2})(y^2+1)^{-1/2}(2y)$$
$$G'(y)=\left(\frac{1}{\frac{(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1/2}}}\right)\left(\frac{(10)(2y+1)^4(y^2+1)^{1/2}-(y)(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1}}\right)$$ Simplify the expression. First, I move $(y^2+1)^{1/2}$ below the denominator.
$$G'(y)=\left(\frac{1}{\frac{(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1/2}}}\right)\left(\frac{(10)(2y+1)^4-(y)(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{-1/2}(y^2+1)^{1}}\right)$$ Combine the denominator terms.
$$G'(y)=\left(\frac{1}{\frac{(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1/2}}}\right)\left(\frac{(10)(2y+1)^4-(y)(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1/2}}\right)$$ Multiply the first term in the expression (the complex fraction term) by the reciprocal of the denominator to eliminate the complex fraction.
$$G'(y)=\left((1)*\frac{(y^2+1)^{1/2}}{(2y+1)^5}\right)\left(\frac{(10)(2y+1)^4-(y)(2y+1)^5}{(y^2+1)^{1/2}}\right)$$ Multiply both of these terms. Note that $(y^2+1)^{1/2}$ is in both the numerator and denominator and therefore cancel.
$$G'(y)=\left(\frac{(y^2+1)^{1/2}[(10)(2y+1)^4-(y)(2y+1)^5]}{(2y+1)^5(y^2+1)^{1/2}}\right)$$
$$G'(y)=\left(\frac{(10)(2y+1)^4-(y)(2y+1)^5}{(2y+1)^5}\right)$$ Now to cancel the $(2y+1)^x$ terms like so:
$$G'(y)=\left(\frac{(10)(2y+1)^4}{(2y+1)^5}\right)-\left(\frac{(y)(2y+1)^5}{(2y+1)^5}\right)$$
$$G'(y)=[(10)(2y+1)^{4-5}]-[(y)(2y+1)^{5-5}]$$
$$G'(y)=[(10)(2y+1)^{-1}]-[(y)(2y+1)^{0}]$$
$$G'(y)=[(10)(2y+1)^{-1}]-(y)$$ Exponent property on $(2y-1)^{-1}$
$$G'(y)=\frac{(10-y)}{(2y+1)^{1}}$$
$$G'(y)=\frac{(10-y)}{(2y+1)}$$ The textbook answer is:
$$G'(y)=\frac{10}{2y+1}-\frac{y}{y^2+1}$$ It looks like I'm missing a term. But I'm not sure how. Thanks for your help.","['derivatives', 'calculus']"

2071159,Struggling to understand epsilon-delta,"The definition of a limit is: $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is a $\delta > 0$ so that whenever $0 < \lvert x - a \rvert < \delta$ we have $\lvert f(x) - L \rvert < \epsilon$ Now it seems pretty intuitive. But I am hung up on a few problems: Many pictures show something like this: epsilon-delta This seems intuitive at first and it demonstrates that $\lvert x - a \rvert$ and $\lvert f(x) - L \rvert < \epsilon$ are not necessarily the same (as the graph can be deceptive, especially if $f(x)$ is a straight line) as when you are projecting from $L$ to the graph down to $a$, $\lvert x - a \rvert$ and $\lvert f(x) - L \rvert$ will be different. The problem in my understanding became apparent when I saw a similar graph in a textbook where the projected lines were not $\lvert f(x) - L \rvert$, but projection for aesthetic purposes and that it was bounded by $\lvert f(x) - L \rvert$. I then realized I don't get it geometrically at all (Google ""mooculus"", page 20). I don't understand what the ""verification"" in the proof is. It seems to be a tautology. For example take $\lvert f(x) - L \rvert < \epsilon \Longrightarrow \lvert (3x - 1) - 2 \rvert < \epsilon$. You will eventually get to $\lvert x - 1 \rvert < \epsilon/3$. Then the proof is ""completed"" by showing that $\lvert x - a \rvert < \delta \Longrightarrow \lvert x - 1 \rvert < \epsilon/3 \Longrightarrow \lvert f(x) - L \rvert < \epsilon$. But $\delta$ is taken to be $\epsilon/3$. It seems to be the equivalent of demonstrating that $x + 1 = 2$ by plugging in $-3$ into it. The proof starts by either assuming the limit exists or doesn't exist. In fact, I've found many textbooks or teachers to take this approach: Think of it as a game. You give me an $\epsilon > 0$ and I can give you a $\delta > 0 $... But they typically omit a glaring part: that if this doesn't hold, the limit doesn't exist. Also glaringly missing, I haven't seen an example of a proof that isn't simply ""proving"" or ""showing"" the premise that is already assumed! How would you for example use the epsilon-delta definition to show a limit doesn't exist if you don't already know in advance it is the case? To extend on number 3, I'm aware that you must choose an $\epsilon$ and that if you prove it for one, you prove it for all. However, the catch is in cases where $\lvert x - a \rvert$ needs to be restricted (i.e, $\lvert x - a \rvert < 1$) $1$ is typically chosen but this does not work in all cases! I have no intuition on how to choose an $\epsilon$ let alone know if I'm simply doing something wrong or if the limit does not exist. That is, proving the negative seems more difficult. Can someone explain it in a different way? I've resorted to many different .edu sources, free online textbooks and even questions on this site and the pedagogy doesn't seem to be reaching me.","['calculus', 'limits']"

2071246,"How many rounds are required in a ""Swiss tournament sorting algorithm""?","You're organizing a Swiss-style tournament with N players of a game. The game is a two-player game, and it results in one winner and one loser. The players are totally ordered by skill, and whenever two players play against each other, the more skilled player always wins. In each tournament round, each player can play only one game. Going into the tournament, nothing is known about the relative skill levels of the players. The pairings for each round are not decided until the previous round has finished, so you can use the results from previous rounds when you're deciding how to pair the players up. You are not required to follow any traditional pairing rules. Your goal is to completely determine the ranking of all $N$ players. What is $Swiss(N)$, the number of rounds required in the worst case? Results for small $N$: If $N$ is $0$ or $1$, the number of rounds required is $0$. For $N = 2$, the number of rounds required is $1$. For $N = 3$, it can be seen that $2$ rounds are not sufficient. If you use only $2$ rounds, then there must be at least two players who only play one game each. If these players both win their games, then their relative skill level is unknown. However, $3$ rounds are sufficient, because this is enough to play out all possible pairings (a round-robin tournament). So the number of rounds required is $3$. For $N = 4$, $3$ rounds are necessary (because they are necessary for $N = 3$) and sufficient (because this is enough for a round-robin tournament). Some sub-questions: We can come up with a logarithmic lower bound for $Swiss(N)$ using information theory. The complete ranking of all $N$ players contains $\log_2(N!)$ bits of information, but each tournament round only gives you $\lfloor N/2 \rfloor$ bits of information, so at least $\log_2(N!) / \lfloor N/2 \rfloor$ rounds are required. Is there a better lower bound? We can come up with a linear upper bound for $Swiss(N)$ by simply pairing every player against every other player (a round-robin tournament). This gives us an upper bound of $N$ for odd $N$, and $N - 1$ for even $N$. Is there a better upper bound? In particular, is there an algorithm which uses $o(N)$ rounds? What is the asymptotic behavior of $Swiss(N)$? Is it logarithmic, linear, or something in between?","['sorting', 'algorithms', 'discrete-mathematics']"

These knights take turns moving (ie., one knight moves, after that another one, once all of them have moved, the first one moves again and the cycle repeats itself). What is the largest $m$ such that for some initial starting position, each knight can tour the board (as described in the first paragraph) without threatening any other knight?

In other words, after choosing wisely $k(n):=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ vectors, it is enough to verify $T$ preserves the norms of these special vectors, in order to conclude it's an isometry. Question: Is there no way to choose less than $k(n)$ vectors, in such a way that every linear map which preserves their norms is an isometry? I believe we cannot choose less vectors. I have some ""convincing evidence"" for the cases $n=1,2,3$ (see below), but I am not sure how to give a rigorous argument. Note that a ""wise choice"" of vectors does not have to be of the form of some vectors, and linear combinations of them (I do feel this it the most efficient method, but I don't see how to prove this). Even if we prove that this is the case, than we need to show we cannot do better than to work with only orthonormal bases. The partial ""evidence"": $n=1: k=1$. Obvious $n=2: k=3$. Take $V=W=\mathbb{R}^n$ with its standard inner product. Then, $T(e_1)=e_1, T(e_2)=\frac{e_1+e_2}{\sqrt 2}$ is a counter example. $n=3: k=6$. Then any matrix of the form $$ \begin{pmatrix} c & s & x \\  -s & c & y  \\  0 & 0 & z \\\end{pmatrix} $$ where $c^2+s^2=1,x^2+y^2+z^2=1, sx+cy=0$ preserves the norms $e_1,e_2,e_1+e_2,e_3,e_2+e_3$ but it's an isometry only if $|z|=1,x=y=0$. Proof that $k(n)=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ vectors are enough: Noting that $$ \langle u,v \rangle = \frac{1}{2}(|u+v|^2 - |u|^2 - |v|^2) ,$$ we obtain $$ \langle Tv_i,Tv_j \rangle = \frac{1}{2}(|Tv_i+Tv_j|^2 - |Tv_i|^2 - |Tv_j|^2) = \frac{1}{2}(|T(v_i+v_j)|^2 - |v_i|^2 - |v_j|^2)  $$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}(|v_i+v_j|^2 - |v_i|^2 - |v_j|^2) = \langle v_i,v_j \rangle,$$ thus $T$ is an isometry.","['isometry', 'combinatorics', 'symmetry', 'linear-algebra']"

2071473,Deriving a Series Representation of the Bessel Function of the First Kind,"I've tried to use an integral representation of the Bessel Function of the First Kind $J_n(x)$ to derive a series representation of the function. My end result is pretty close to the answer that it should be, but it still doesn't quite match up and I'd be grateful for anybody that could point out where my work is faulty. \begin{align}
J_n(x) &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\cos(n\phi-x\sin\phi)d\phi\\
&= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}e^{in\phi}e^{-ix\sin\phi}d\phi \tag1\\ 
&=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\left(e^{i\phi}\right)^ne^{-\frac{x}{2}\left(e^{i\phi}-e^{-i\phi}\right)}d\phi \tag2
\end{align} In $(1)$, I used the fact that the integral of the imaginary part of the integrand over a complete period is equal to $0$. A parametrisation of the unit circle in the complex plane is given by $z=e^{i\phi}, \phi\in(0,2\pi)$, thus $e^{-i\phi}=\left(e^{i\phi}\right)^{-1}=\frac{1}{z}$. Letting $\Gamma$ be the unit circle in the complex plane traversed in the counterclockwise direction, $(2)$ becomes \begin{align}
J_n(x) &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint_\Gamma z^n e^{-\frac{x}{2}z}e^{\frac{x}{2z}}dz\\
&= \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint_\Gamma z^n e^{-\frac{x}{2}z}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^k}{2^kk!z^k}dz \tag3\\
&=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^k}{2^kk!}\oint_\Gamma z^{n-k}e^{-\frac{x}{2}z}dz\\
&=i\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^k}{2^kk!}\text{Res}\left(z^{n-k}e^{-\frac{x}{2}z},0\right) \tag4
\end{align} $(3)$ uses the Laurent series expansion of $e^{\frac{1}{z}}$ and $(4)$ uses the Residue Theorem. Let $m:=k-n\rightarrow k=m+n$. Then the Residue of $z^{-m}e^{-\frac{x}{2}z}$ is only non-zero for strictly positive values of $m$ and $(4)$ becomes \begin{align}
J_n(x) &= i\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{x^{m+n}}{2^{m+n}(m+n)!}\text{Res}\left(z^{-m}e^{-\frac{x}{2}z},0\right)\\
&= i\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{x^{m+n}}{2^{m+n}(m+n)!}\frac{1}{(m-1)!}\lim\limits_{z\rightarrow 0}\frac{d^{m-1}}{dz^{m-1}}e^{-\frac{x}{2}z}\\
&=i\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{x^{m+n}}{2^{m+n}(m+n)!}\frac{(-1)^{m-1}}{(m-1)!}\frac{x^{m-1}}{2^{m-1}} \tag5
\end{align} Letting $r=m-1\rightarrow m=r+1$, $(5)$ becomes \begin{align}
J_n(x)=i\sum_{r=0}^{\infty}(-1)^r\frac{x^{2r+n+1}}{2^{2r+n+1}r!(r+n+1)!}\tag6
\end{align} However, comparing this with the known series representation, the $i$ shouldn't be there (obviously, since $J_n(x)$ is a real function) and the sum (disregarding the $i$ for a moment) is actually a series representation of $J_{n+1}(x)$, not $J_n(x)$. I've been over this calculation a few times, and I simply cannot find where I made a mistake that either allowed the $i$ to creep in there or that raised the order of the Bessel Function that I am trying to find a series representation for.

My effort: Let $b = \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n$ . Let's first suppose that $\left\{ b_n \right\}$ is monotonically decreasing. Then $b_n \geq b$ for all $n$ . So we have $$ b_0 - b \geq b_1 - b \geq \cdots \geq 0.$$ Moreover the sequence of the partial sums of $\sum a_n$ is bounded and $\lim_{n \to \infty} \left( b_n - b \right) = 0$ . So by Theorem 3.42 in Rudin, we can conclude that $\sum a_n (b_n - b)$ converges. And since $a_n b_n = a_n (b_n - b) + a_n b$ and since $\sum a_n$ converges, therefore $\sum a_n b_n$ converges by Theorems 3.47 in Rudin. Now let's suppose that $\left\{ b_n \right\}$ is monotonically increasing. Then $\left\{ -b_n \right\}$ is monotonically decreasing and so $\sum a_n \left(-b_n\right)$ converges. Therefore by Theorem 3.47 in Rudin $\sum a_n b_n$ converges as well. Is my proof correct?

To elaborate on the meaning on the RHS of $\mapsto$ an $S$-scheme $X$ is mapped to the set of maps from $\phi ^*E$ to $L$, where $L$ is invertible, modulo isomorphisms i.e. two maps $a$ and $b$ are same iff $\exists s:L_1\rightarrow L_2$ such that $b=sa$.

I'm trying to solve this problem $(5.8)$ from Bass' Real Analysis for Graduate Students: Show that if $f:\Bbb{R}\to\Bbb{R}$ is Lebesgue measurable and $$f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$$ for all $x,y\in\Bbb{R}$, then $f$ is continuous. The first thing I note is that it suffices to show that $f$ is continuous at $0$, since if this is the case then for any $\epsilon>0$ and $x_0\in\Bbb R$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that $|x|<\delta$ implies $|f(x)|<\epsilon$; in particular, replacing $x$ with $x-x_0$, we see $|x-x_0|<\delta$ implies $|f(x)-f(x_0)|=|f(x-x_0)|<\epsilon$. Now, what I need to show then is that $f^{-1}(-\epsilon,\epsilon)$ contains some interval at the origin. I know that this set is Lebesgue measurable because $(-\epsilon,\epsilon)$ is Borel measurable, and I know it contains $0$ since $f(0)=0$, but I'm not sure how to show it contains $(-\delta,\delta)$ for some $\delta$. I haven't used the fact that the set is Lebesgue measurable, so obviously theres some way I can use that but I'm not seeing it. Any suggestions? edit: because this has been tagged as a possible duplicate, I should point out that I'd prefer to figure out if the solution I am working on will work, rather than just copy a completely different solution outlined by some other user.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"
2071775,Intersection with object on ellipsoid path,"In my game I need to calculate the time when a ship arrives at the planet. What is known is ship's starting position and velocity (which is constant), and planet’s position at a given time (it follows an elliptic path). To be more specific: Regarding the ship: $x_0, y_0$ - ship's initial position $v$ - ship's constant speed Regarding the planet: The planet’s position is given by $$\begin{align}x(t)&=a\cos{\omega_0t}\\y(t)&=b\sin{\omega_0t}\end{align}$$ with $a\ge b\gt0$ and $\omega_0\gt0$. I.e., the planet’s path follows an ellipse in standard position with a phase of $0$. Now, what I need to know, is at what point does the two positions intersect (ship's position and planet's position). So I am either looking for the intersection time $t_i$, or an intersection point $p_i$, or angle $\alpha$ at which the ships should be fired, or distance $d_i$ of intersection point from starting point $x_0, y_0$. Any of these 4 things should do (figuring one from the other is trivial, of course). I am looking for the closest such intersection point of course (the smallest such $d_i$ or $t_i$ of all possible ones). In other words, I need to know at what angle should I send the ship from $x_0, y_0$ so that it will arrive at the planet in smallest possible time.

It is well-known that two ordered sets of $n+2$ points in $\mathbb{P}^n$ in general position are projectively equivalent, and that any two ordered sets of three pairwise disjoint lines in $\mathbb{P}^3$ are projectively equivalent. Likewise, any two pairs of a hyperplane in $\mathbb{P}^n$ and a point outside of it are projectively equivalent. Three pairwise disjoint lines satisfies the condition that no two of them lies in a 2-plane, which is a condition on their relative position similar to points in general position. I have two questions: 1) In what sense does collections of linear subspaces lie in general position? Is it simply that any subset of them span a linear subspace of maximal dimension? 2) What kind of ""classifying theorems"" are there regarding which pairs of collections of ordered linear subspaces in $\mathbb{P}^n$ (in general position, or other types of conditions) are projectively equivalent? I'm looking for a sharp relation between the number $k$, the individual dimensions of each $\Lambda_i$, and the strictness of the condition of their relative position under which two such collections are projectively equivalent.

This problem appeared in the American Mathematical Monthly magazine in 1965, the inequality was proposed in that form by Sir Alexander Oppenheim: Let $x,y,z$ positive real  numbers and $\Delta ABC$ a triangle . $\displaystyle [ABC]$ denotes the triangle area  and $\displaystyle a,b,c$ the sides of the triangle. The inequality below is true: $$a^2x+b^2y+c^2z\geq 4[ABC]\sqrt{xy+xz+yz}$$ Various inequalities can be deduced through this inequality, for example, Weitzenböck's inequality, Neuberg-Pedoe inequality, Hadwiger-Finsler inequality, and so on. I'll post my solution right below.
$$Proof$$ Let $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$  denote the opposite angles to the sides $a, b, c$, respectively. $R$ is the circumradius of $\Delta ABC$. Observe that:
    $$a^2x+b^2y+c^2z\geq 4[ABC]\sqrt{xy+xz+yz}$$
  $$a^2x+b^2y+c^2z\geq \frac{abc}{R}\sqrt{xy+xz+yz}$$

    $$\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{4aR^2x}{2Rbc}+\frac{4bR^2y}{2Rac}+\frac{4cR^2z}{2Rab}\right)\geq \sqrt{xy+xz+yz}$$

 (\cot\beta+\cot\gamma)x+(\cot\alpha+\cot\gamma)y+(\cot\alpha+\cot\beta)z\geq 2\sqrt{xy+xz+yz} \tag{1}
\end{equation} Since inequality is homogeneous in the variables $x,y,z$, do it $\displaystyle xy+xz+yz=1$ and take the substitution $\displaystyle x=\cot\alpha',y=\cot\beta',z=\cot\gamma'$, we have que $\displaystyle \alpha',\beta',\gamma'$ are angles of a triangle, and our inequality will be equivalent to the inequality below: \begin{equation}
  (\cot\beta+\cot\gamma)\cot\alpha'+(\cot\alpha+\cot\gamma)\cot\beta'+(\cot\alpha+\cot\beta)\cot\gamma'\geq 2 \tag{2}
\end{equation}
Suppose without loss of generality that (the reverse case is analogous) : \begin{equation}
 \cot\alpha \geq  \cot \alpha' \tag{3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \cot\beta \geq \cot \beta' \tag{4}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \cot\gamma'\geq \cot \gamma \tag{5}
\end{equation}
Because these variables are angles of a triangle, we can not have $\cot \alpha \geq \cot \alpha' , \cot\beta \geq \cot \beta', \cot \gamma\geq \cot\gamma'$.In fact, this can not occur, since it supposes without loss of generality that $\displaystyle \alpha'\geq\alpha$ and  $\displaystyle \beta'\geq\beta$(as the cotangent is decreasing, this implies that $\displaystyle  \cot\alpha \geq \cot \alpha' $  and $\displaystyle \cot\beta \geq \cot \beta'$), summing up these first two inequalities we have: $\\ \\ \displaystyle \alpha'+\beta'\geq \alpha+\beta \Rightarrow \cot(\alpha+\beta)\geq \cot(\alpha'+\beta')\Rightarrow -\cot(\pi-\alpha+\beta)\geq- \cot(\pi-\alpha'+\beta') \Rightarrow -\cot(\alpha+\beta+\gamma-(\alpha+\beta))\geq- \cot(\alpha'+\beta'+\gamma'-(\alpha'+\beta')) \Rightarrow -\cot(\gamma)\geq- \cot(\gamma')  \Rightarrow \cot(\gamma')\geq \cot(\gamma)\\ \\$ Now set the $\displaystyle f_1(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\alpha',\beta',\gamma'):\mathbb{R}^6\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $\displaystyle f_2(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\alpha',\beta',\gamma'):\mathbb{R}^6\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that: \begin{equation*}

 (\cot\beta'+\cot\gamma')(\cot\alpha-\cot\alpha')+(\cot\alpha'+\cot\gamma')(\cot\beta-\cot\beta')+(\cot\alpha'+\cot\beta')(\cot\gamma-\cot\gamma') \tag{7}
\end{equation} Note now that by inequalities (3), (4) and (5) it follows that: \begin{equation}
0 \geq  \cot\alpha'-\cot\alpha \tag{8}
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
 0 \geq \cot \beta' -\cot\beta \tag{9}
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
 \cot\gamma'-\cot\gamma \geq 0 \tag{10}
\end{equation}
We know that  $\displaystyle \alpha',\beta',\gamma'$ are angles of a triangle, so there exists $\displaystyle a',b',c'$ such that $\displaystyle a'^2=b'^2+c'^2-2b'c'\cos\alpha',b'^2=a'^2+c'^2-2a'c'\cos\beta',c'^2=a'^2+b'^2-2a'b'\cos\gamma'$.Let $\displaystyle R'$ the circumradius of the triangle of sides $\displaystyle a',b',c'$. Let $\displaystyle k_{\alpha',\beta',\gamma'}:=\frac{a'}{b'c'}+\frac{b'}{a'c'}+\frac{c'}{a'b'}$, therefore: \begin{equation}
 \frac{a'}{b'c'}+\frac{b'}{a'c'}+\frac{c'}{a'b'}=k_{\alpha',\beta',\gamma'} \tag{11}
\end{equation} Where $\displaystyle k_{\alpha',\beta',\gamma'}$ is a real variable of any kind.And since our original inequality is homogeneous in the variables a, b, c, suppose without loss of generality that the equality below occurs: \begin{equation}
 \frac{a}{bc}+\frac{b}{ac}+\frac{c}{ab}=k_{\alpha',\beta',\gamma'} \tag{12}
\end{equation} For each real value of fixed $\displaystyle k_{\alpha',\beta',\gamma'}$.Since x, y, z do not depend of the circumradius R ', suppose that $\displaystyle R'\geq R$.Take the inequality (3) and consider the development (applying the law of cosines and law of sines):
$\\ \displaystyle \cot\alpha \geq  \cot\alpha' \Rightarrow  \frac{(b^2+c^2-a^2)R}{abc} \geq \frac{(b'^2+c'^2-a'^2)R'}{a'b'c'} \Rightarrow  \left(\frac{a}{bc}+\frac{b}{ac}+\frac{c}{ab}-2\frac{a}{bc}\right)R\geq \left(\frac{a'}{b'c'}+\frac{b'}{a'c'}+\frac{c'}{a'b'}-2\frac{a'}{b'c'}\right)R' \Rightarrow  Rk_{\alpha',\beta',\gamma'}-2\frac{aR}{bc}\geq Rk_{\alpha',\beta',\gamma'}-2\frac{a'R'}{b'c'} \Rightarrow \frac{a'R'}{b'c'}\geq \frac{aR}{bc} \Rightarrow $ \begin{equation}
 \frac{a'R'}{b'c'}\geq \frac{aR}{bc} \tag{13}
\end{equation} Applying the same rationale for inequality (4), we conclude:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{b'R'}{a'c'}\geq \frac{bR}{ac} \tag{14}
\end{equation} Suppose by contradiction that it occurs: \begin{equation}
   \cot\alpha+\cot\gamma>  \cot\alpha'+\cot\gamma' \tag{15}
  \end{equation} See that: $\\ \displaystyle \cot\alpha+\cot\gamma>  \cot\alpha'+\cot\gamma' \Rightarrow \frac{(b^2+c^2-a^2)R}{abc}+\frac{(a^2+b^2-c^2)R}{abc}> \frac{(b'^2+c'^2-a'^2)R'}{a'b'c'}+\frac{(a'^2+b'^2-c'^2)R'}{a'b'c'} \Rightarrow \frac{bR}{ac}>\frac{b'R'}{a'c'} \\$ This contradicts the inequality (14). On the other hand, suppose by contradiction that it occurs: \begin{equation}
   \cot\beta+\cot\gamma>  \cot\beta'+\cot\gamma' \tag{16}
  \end{equation} See that: $\\ \displaystyle \cot\beta+\cot\gamma>  \cot\beta'+\cot\gamma' \Rightarrow \frac{(a^2+c^2-b^2)R}{abc}+\frac{(a^2+b^2-c^2)R}{abc}> \frac{(a'^2+c'^2-b'^2)R'}{a'b'c'}+\frac{(a'^2+b'^2-c'^2)R'}{a'b'c'} \Rightarrow \frac{aR}{bc}>\frac{a'R'}{b'c'} \\$ This contradicts the inequality (13).Therefore: \begin{equation}
   \cot\alpha+\cot\gamma \leq \cot\alpha'+\cot\gamma' \tag{17}
  \end{equation} \begin{equation}
   \cot\beta+\cot\gamma \leq  \cot\beta'+\cot\gamma' \tag{18}
  \end{equation} Multiplying (17) by $\displaystyle \cot\beta'-\cot\beta$ and  multiplying (18) by $\displaystyle \cot\alpha'-\cot\alpha$, note that these inequalities will reverse, since we are multiplying by non-positive quantities, we will have, respectively: \begin{equation}
   (\cot\alpha+\cot\gamma) (\cot\beta'-\cot\beta)\geq (\cot\alpha'+\cot\gamma')(\cot\beta'-\cot\beta) \tag{19}
  \end{equation} \begin{equation}
   (\cot\beta+\cot\gamma) (\cot\alpha'-\cot\alpha)\geq  (\cot\beta'+\cot\gamma')(\cot\alpha'-\cot\alpha) \tag{20}
  \end{equation} On the other hand of inequalities (3) and (4) we know that:
  \begin{equation}
   \cot\alpha+\cot\beta \geq \cot\alpha'+\cot\beta' \tag{21}
  \end{equation}
  Multiplying the above inequality by $\displaystyle \cot\gamma'-\cot\gamma$, that by the inequality (10) we know to be greater than or equal to zero, we will have: \begin{equation}
   (\cot\alpha+\cot\beta) (\cot\gamma'-\cot\gamma)\geq (\cot\alpha'+\cot\beta')(\cot\gamma'-\cot\gamma) \tag{22}
  \end{equation}
Adding (19), (20) and (22), we will have: \begin{equation*}
   f_1(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\alpha',\beta',\gamma')\geq
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{equation}
   (\cot\alpha'+\cot\gamma')(\cot\beta'-\cot\beta)+(\cot\beta'+\cot\gamma')(\cot\alpha'-\cot\alpha)+(\cot\alpha'+\cot\beta')(\cot\gamma'-\cot\gamma) \tag{23}
  \end{equation} Adding the LHS of (23) with the LHS of (7) and the RHS of (23) with the RHS of (7), the terms will cancel and we will have: \begin{equation}
   f_1(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\alpha',\beta',\gamma')+f_2(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\alpha',\beta',\gamma')\geq 0
  \end{equation}
And this implies, finally, that: \begin{equation}
 (\cot\beta+\cot\gamma)\cot\alpha'+(\cot\alpha+\cot\gamma)\cot\beta'+(\cot\alpha+\cot\beta)\cot\gamma'\geq 2
\end{equation}
That is precisely the inequality (2), which is equivalent to the desired inequality.Thus, the inequality yields.","['inequality', 'trigonometry', 'geometric-inequalities', 'geometry', 'contest-math']"
2072097,Vector space of differential forms on a curve,"Why is the space of differential forms on a curve (defined on the fraction field of the coordinate ring) a one-dimensional vector space over the function field of the curve?

2072103,Integration of Power Series. When is the Function in $L_1$?,"Suppose we are given a function $f$ in terms of its power series
\begin{align}
f(x)= \sum_{n+0}^\infty a_n x^n.
\end{align}
We assume that we know all $a_n$'s and $f$ has infinite radius of convergense. Can we say based on $a_n$ if the function is integrable or not? That is if 
\begin{align}
\int_{\mathbb{R}} |f(x)| dx<\infty.
\end{align} For example, if $a_n \ge 0$ then we have that
\begin{align}
f(x) \ge a_0+a_1 x,\  x >0 ,
\end{align}
and the function is not integrable. The case that I am interested is when $a_n$'s have alternating sign. 
  Specifically, can we determine if the following $f(x)$ is integrable
  \begin{align} f(x)= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\cos( \frac{\pi}{2}k)\
 (k+1)^{\frac{k+1}{6}}}{k!} x^k. \end{align} Here is the plot of $f(x)$ where the series was computed up to $N=600$. where blue curve is $f(x)$ and red curve is $sinc(\pi/2 x)= \frac{\sin(\pi/2 x)}{\pi/2 x}$. It seems that $f(x)$ has a tail that decays faster than $sinc(\pi/2 x)$. Moreover, next we give a plot of $f(x) \cdot x$  and  $f(x) \cdot x^2$ where blue curve is $f(x) \cdot x$ and red curve is  $f(x) \cdot x^2$. This seems to indicate that $f(x)$ decreases faster than $\frac{1}{x^2}$ which would imply that $f(x)$ is integrable. Therefore, it would also be interesting to show that 
\begin{align}
\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)=0,
\end{align}

2072107,integration - bartle theorem 5.3 - absolute integrability,"Theorem 5.3: A measurable function $f$ belongs to  $L$ if and only if $|f| $ belongs to $L$. Definitions: $L = L(X,\mathbf{X}, \mu)$ of integrable functions consists of all real-valued $\mathbf{X}$-measurable functions $f$ defined on $X$, such that both the positive and negative parts $f^{+}, f^{-}$ of $f$ have finite integrals with respect to $\mu$. A function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbf{X}$-measurable if $f^{-1}((\alpha, \infty)) $ are measurable sets for all real $\alpha$. If $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$ is $\mathbf{X}$-measurable we define the integral with respect to $\mu$ to be the extended real number 
$$ \int f \, d \mu = \sup \int \phi \, d \mu ,$$ 
where supremum is taken over all simple functions $\phi: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $ 0 \le \phi \le f $. (The integral of simple function is then the usual one with $\mu$.) What I don't see: $|f| \in L \Rightarrow f \in L$ We have $|f|^{+} = f^{+} + f^{-} , |f|^{-} = 0$ have finite integrals. But this does even not imply that $f^{+}$ and $f^{-}$ are $\mathbf{X}$- measurable. What am I missing?

The left nullspace is $N(A^t)$, a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$. This is our new space. If the column space is the space that is spanned by the column vectors, why is it that it is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ and not $\mathbb{R}^n$, since the dimension of the columns should be $n$ instead?

2072123,Looking for an elementary explanation for the existence of spinors,"(Dear mods, I have edited the question. The previous version was probably too confused.) I can convince myself that spinors exist in 2D using complex numbers. The elementary example is a (complex number) $f (\theta) = \exp(i \theta /2)$. When the argument is increased by $2\pi$, it flips sign ($\exp(i (\theta + 2\pi) /2) $ = $-\exp(i \theta /2)$), and requires another rotation of $2\pi$ to bring it back to the original value, and it is therefore a spinor. I want to understand why we can deduce, hopefully in a similarly easy way,  that spinors can exist even in a three (odd-dimensional) space.

2072137,Well Ordering and Isomorphism: Possible Error in Textbook Proof?,"My textbook claims to prove the statement that for $2$ well-ordered sets, $X$ and $Y$, either $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic or one of the sets is isomorphic to an initial segment of the other set (i.e. an upper bounded subset of the other set). The proof starts off: ""Let $X$ be well-ordered, and let $f:X \Rightarrow X$ be a monotonic map, i.e., $$Z_1<Z_2 \Rightarrow f(Z_1)<f(Z_2).$$  Then for all $Z \in X$ we have $f(Z)\geq Z$..."" 1) Isn't this the definition of strictly increasing, not monotonic? 2) Take $X = [0,5]$ and $f(x) = 0.5x$. This is a strictly increasing map of $X$ to itself--note that the least element is preserved--for which $f(Z) \leq Z$. Who's confused: me or the author?",['functions']

$(iii)$ Translation invariance : For any measurable set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and for any $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$, $E+x := \{y+x|y \in E\}$ is measurable and $m(E+x)=m(E)$. $(iv)$ Normalization : $m([0,1]^d)=1$, i.e. measure of the unit hypercube is $1$. My approach: To go via Lebesgue outer measure . We already know that the only mapping from the class of all subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ (which obviously contains the class of all measurable sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$) to $[0,+\infty]$, satisfying $(i)$, a weaker version of $(ii)$ (only subadditivity ) and $(iv)$, is the Lebesgue outer measure $m^*(\cdot)$. Then the job left is to show that with strict additivity and translation invariance , the Lebesgue outer measure $m^*(\cdot)$ is upgraded to the Lebesgue measure $m(\cdot)$, which I cannot complete. Any help is greatly appreciated!","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory']"
