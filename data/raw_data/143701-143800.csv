2336800,Is the nuclear norm equal to the Hilbert-Schmidt norm for a particular operator?,"Suppose that $\varphi,\gamma\in L^2([0,1],\mathbb C)$ and define the operator $\varphi\otimes\gamma:L^2([0,1],\mathbb C)\to L^2([0,1],\mathbb C)$ by setting $\varphi\otimes\gamma=\langle\cdot,\gamma\rangle\varphi$. This is an integral operator with the kernel given by $\varphi(x)\overline\gamma(y)$ for each $x,y\in [0,1]$. Hence, the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of this operator is given by
$$
\|\varphi\otimes\gamma\|_{HS}=\biggl(\int_0^1\int_0^1|\varphi(x)\overline\gamma(y)|^2dxdy\biggr)^{1/2}=\|\varphi\|\|\gamma\|.
$$
I want to find the singular values of this operator so that I can obtain the nuclear norm. Since the adjoint of $\varphi\otimes\gamma$ is given by $\gamma\otimes\varphi$, we have that
$$
(\varphi\otimes\gamma)^*(\varphi\otimes\gamma)(f)=\langle f,\gamma\rangle\|\varphi\|^2\gamma
$$
and if we set $f=\gamma/\|\gamma\|$, we obtain
$$
(\varphi\otimes\gamma)^*(\varphi\otimes\gamma)(\gamma\|\gamma\|)=\|\varphi\|^2\|\gamma\|^2\gamma/\|\gamma\|.
$$
The composition of operators $(\varphi\otimes\gamma)^*(\varphi\otimes\gamma)$ has one non-zero eigenfunction $\gamma/\|\gamma\|$ with the corresponding eigenvalue $\|\varphi\|^2\|\gamma\|^2$. Hence, the operator $\varphi\otimes\gamma$ has one non-zero singular value given by $\|\varphi\|\|\gamma\|$ and the nuclear norm of $\varphi\otimes\gamma$ is equal to $\|\varphi\|\|\gamma\|$, which is also the Hilbert-Schmidt of this operator. Are my calculations correct? Does the composition of operators $(\varphi\otimes\gamma)^*(\varphi\otimes\gamma)$ have only one non-zero eigenfunction and the corresponding non-zero eigenvalue? Are the Hilbert-Schmidt and the nuclear norms really equal for this operator?

2336977,Differentiable bijection $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with nonzero derivative whose inverse is not differentiable,"I had an exam today, and I was asked about the inverse function theorem, and the exact conditions and statement (as stated in Mathematical Analysis by VA Zorich):
Let $X, Y \subset \mathbb{R}$ be open sets and let the functions $f: X \to Y$ and $f^{-1}: Y \to X$ be mutually inverse and continuous at points $x_{0} \in X$ and $y_{0}=f(x_{0})$, respectively. If $f$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$ and $f'(x_{0}) \neq 0$, then $f^{-1}$ is also differentiable at $y_{0}$  and its derivative is $$(f^{-1})'(y_{0})=(f'(x_{0}))^{-1}=\frac{1}{f'(x_{0})}.$$ Then I was asked to come up with an example which would show that the condition that $f^{-1}$ be continuous at $y_{0}$ is not redundant, i.e. that there exists a differentiable bijection $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f'(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, but whose inverse $f^{-1}$ is non-differentiable at some point $y_{0} \in \mathbb{R}$ (my professor stated that both the domain and range are $\mathbb{R}$, but I'd be open to any example whose domain/range are open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$). I couldn't come up with an answer on the spot, so I was left with a homework assignment, which I'm shamelessly asking for help with here. Here are some examples that almost, but don't quite fit the bill: $f(x)=x^3, f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, whose inverse $f^{-1}(y)=\sqrt[3]y$ is not differentiable at $0$, but the problem is that $f'(0)=0$. If $f'(x) \neq 0$ were removed as a conditions, many counterexamples could be easily found, because any bijection $f$ whose derivative is zero at $x$ implies that $f^{-1}$ is not differentiable at $f(x)$. An example which is possibly closer to what I'm looking for is the one found in the answer of Functions which are Continuous, but not Bicontinuous , which fits the bill completely except for the domain/range, because $f^{-1}$ is not continuous at 1, let alone differentiable, but its domain is not an open or connected set, so it wouldn't be easy to extend its domain to $\mathbb{R}$ and still keep all of its properties. I'm aware that the inverse $f^{-1}$ of a continuous bijection $f$ defined on an interval ($\mathbb{R}$ in this case) is also continuous, so the ""pathological inverse"" that I'm looking for is continuous (unlike example 2), but not differentiable (i.e. ""spiky"") at a point, even though $f$ isn't ""spiky"" anywhere.","['real-analysis', 'examples-counterexamples', 'inverse-function', 'inverse-function-theorem']"
2337130,"How to find rotated top, left of a rectangle given I have top, left and rotation angle","I think this is a simple problem but my Math/Geometry skills are not very good. I am given the top,left coordinates and the height & width of a rectangle as input. Using this I plot the rectangle inside a larger one, using the top, left coordinates of the inside (smaller) rectangle as an offset from the top, left of the larger rectangle. Let the unit of measurement be pixels. So if the top,left coordinates are (0,0) for the lower rectangle it means it is also starting at the same exact coordinate as the larger one. I then draw them till height,width pixels. If the coordinates are (100,50) then it means that smaller rectangle starts 100px to the right and 50px lower to the top of the top, left of the larger rectangle, etc. I hope you get the point. Now I am having an additional fifth input point which is the rotation angle for the smaller rectangle. So suppose I have as top, left values (10,5) and a rotation angle value of 45 for the smaller rectangle. This now means that my smaller rectangle should now be rotated at clockwise 45 degress, whereby the rectangle now will now no longer be parallel to the ground. How to I calculate the necessary top, left coordinate in order to draw this rotated rectangle?","['angle', 'rectangles', 'geometry']"

2337150,Vector fields and complex integrals of meromorphic functions,"I'm wondering if there's a way to guess the value of complex contour integral of some meromorphic function or at least its sign, anything useful really. I've been thinking about exploiting vector field intepretation. Consider a complex function $f(z)=f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$ holomorphic on some open subset $D\in\mathbb{C}.$ Notice that vector field $\overrightarrow{F}=(u,-v)^T$ is conservative. It's due to the fact that holomorphic functions satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, i.e. $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}u(x,y)=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}v(x,y),$$ $$\frac{\partial}{\partial y}u(x,y)=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}v(x,y).$$ In 2 dimensions we have $$\mathrm{curl}\overrightarrow{F}=-\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}u(x,y)+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}v(x,y)\right)\overrightarrow{k}=0,$$ $$\mathrm{div}\overrightarrow{F}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}u(x,y)-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}v(x,y)=0,$$ where $\overrightarrow{k}=(0,0,1)^T.$ Means that $\overrightarrow{F}$ is both irrotational and solenoidal. The above is particulary useful when trying to prove Cauchy integral theorem and path-independence of the line integral for holomorphic functions. Taking it further, let us consider some meromorphic function $g(z)$ with one isolated singularity at some $z_0$ then for aribtrary $r>0$ the integral over $\partial S=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z-z_0|=r\}$ counter-clockwise is \begin{align}
\int_{\partial S}g(z)\mathrm{d}z&=\int_{\partial S}\left(\varphi(x,y)+i\psi(x,y)\right)\mathrm{d}(x+iy)\\&=i\int_{\partial S}\psi(x,y)\mathrm{d}x+\varphi(x,y)\mathrm{d}y+\int_{\partial S}\varphi(x,y)\mathrm{d}x-\psi(x,y)\mathrm{d}y\\&=i\iint_{S}\left(\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}\right)\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y-\iint_{S}\left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}\right)\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y\\&=i\iint_S\mathrm{div}\overrightarrow{G}\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y+\iint_S\mathrm{curl}\overrightarrow{G}\circ \overrightarrow{k}\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y,
\end{align} where $\overrightarrow{G}=(\varphi,-\psi)^T$ . As an example we can look at $g(z)=1/z$ , where we know the value $\int_{\partial S}g(z)\mathrm{d}z=2\pi i.$ Is there any actual correspondence to the formula I've written? The only I see is that rotation part must be equal to zero. Then all the contribution comes from divergence at $z_0$ . Of course curl and divergence can be undefined or infinite at $z_0$ , but don't bother for a while and think in sense of limits maybe. In other words, I'm interested in comprehending and somehow describing perturbation of such vector field caused by the presence of singularity I suppose there's some mind-blowing interpretation with vortices, sources, sinks and molecules travelling through the field analogous to those appearing in multivariable calculus. I really hope someone happens to see it and is so kind to share his or hers views.","['intuition', 'complex-analysis', 'vector-fields', 'complex-integration']"

If you take a random ball from the first box and a random ball from the second box, what is the probability that the ball are the same?

$$P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A)=20\%*\frac{1}{2}+25\%*\frac{1}{2}=22.5\%$$ 2) $B=$probability of a blu ball, $A=$first box $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}=\frac{20\%*\frac{1}{2}}{22.5\%}=0.88$$ I think that what I did until now is right.

2337184,"how many ""pure ternary"" operators are there?","Pure ternary operator is a function $T:A\times A\times A \to A$ such that for every pair of binary operators $f,g:A\times A \to A$ and for each of the following inequalities $f(g(x,y),z) \ne T(x,y,z)$ $f(x,g(y,z)) \ne T(x,y,z)$ there is a triplet $x,y,z\in A$ for which the inequality holds Basically I cannot replace T with two binary operators in a simple composition. Such ternary functions exist (for the set of size two):
$$T(1,0,0)=1  \quad T(0,0,0)=0 \quad T(0,1,0)=1 \quad T(1,0,1)=1  \quad T(0,1,1)=0 \\ T(1,1,1)=0\;or\; 1 \quad T(1,1,0) = 0 \quad T(0,0,1)=1 \quad $$ Lets rule out the possibility the inner binary function is applied on the left two elements. Then the outer function has for the zero as its right argument two possible outcomes, so the inner function has to map the left(1,0) and (0,1) to the same element. But if that is true, than (1,0,1) and (0,1,1) needs to be mapped on the same element, but they are not. The possibility of the inner function being applied on the right two elements can't happen neither. (0,1,0) and (0,1,1) have different images, but (0,1,0) and (0,0,1) have the same image, so the right (1,0) and (0,1) has to be mapped identically. That would imply (1,1,0) and (1,0,1) have the same image, but they do not. So no matter what operators I choose, I cannot use them in ""simple"" composition to obtain this ternary operator. Hope my proof is correct. And such a way of constructing the ""pure ternary"" function could be (I think) applied for larger sets as well. I tried to google more information about it, but I was unsuccessful. Mostly I ended it up on topic related to Are all n-ary operators simply compositions of binary operators? . But I am interested only in this kind of composition. So my question: Is there a way to calculate (without going through all possibilities) the number of ""pure ternary"" operators on a set of size $n$? I really do not know how to approach this.

2337240,Check Solution: $x^2y''+xy'-y=x^2e^x$ via Variation of Parameters,"I was revisiting differential equations and I came across the following question: By method of variation of parameters, the particular solution of the equation $$x^2y''+xy'-y=x^2e^x$$is: $(a) \ e^x+\frac1x$ $(b)\ e^x- \frac{e^x}x$ $(c)\ e^x+\frac{e^x}x$ $(d)\ e^x-\frac1x$ My attempt: Let $x=e^z$. Then the differential equation becomes: $$\frac{d^2y}{dz^2}-y=e^{2z}e^{e^z}$$
  Solution of the homogenous equation is :$y_c=c_1 e^z + c_2 e^{-z}$ where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants. Thus, solution of original homogenous equation is $y_c=c_1x+c_2\frac1x$. I calculated the Wronskian which came out to be $\frac{-2}{x}$. Therefore, particular solution is 
  $$y_p=-x\int \frac{x^2e^x}{-2}+\frac1x \int \frac{x^4e^x}{-2}=\frac x2 \int x^2e^x-\frac{1}{2x} \int x^4 e^x $$ On simplifying : $$-\frac32 x^2 e^x-\frac{11}2 xe^x +12e^x\left(1-\frac1x\right)$$ Where have I gone wrong?

$$\lim\limits_{h\to 0^+}h \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f(nh)=\int_0^{\infty}f(x)dx$$
First, we notice that for the integral to converge $f$ has to be decreasing. Now we have
$$\int_{(n-1)h}^{nh}f(x)dx\geq f(nh)h\geq\int_{nh}^{(n+1)h}f(x)dx$$
Summing from $n=1$, we get
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\int_{(n-1)h}^{nh}f(x)dx\geq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f(nh)h\geq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\int_{nh}^{(n+1)h}f(x)dx$$
$$\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)dx\geq h\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f(nh)\geq \int_{h}^{\infty}f(x)dx$$
We apply the limit
$$\lim\limits_{h\to 0^+}\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)dx\geq \lim\limits_{h\to 0^+}h\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f(nh)\geq \lim\limits_{h\to 0^+}\int_{h}^{\infty}f(x)dx$$
$$\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)dx\geq \lim\limits_{h\to 0^+} h\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f(nh)\geq \int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)dx$$

$$\lim\limits_{h\to 0^+} h\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f(nh)= \int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)dx$$

2337291,Proving that alternate definitions of the derivative in Differential Topology are equivalent,"Preface This post may be quite long, however I wanted my question to be as complete as possible so please bear with me. Suppose $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$ and $N \subseteq \mathbb{R}^l$ are two smooth manifolds of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, and let $f : M \to N$ be a smooth mapping between these two manifolds, and let $x \in M$. Definition $(1)$ - As a map between tangent spaces The derivative of $f$ at $x$ is the a linear transformation of the tangent spaces $$df_x : TM_x \to TN_{f(x)}$$ Now we know the following is true: Suppose $\phi : U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m \to M$ is a parameterization of a neighbourhood $\phi[U]$ of $x$, with $\phi(u) =x$ for some $u \in U$, and similarly suppose $\psi : V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \to N$ is a parameterization of a neighbourhood $\psi[V]$ of $f(x)$, with $\psi(v) =f(x)$ for some $v \in V$. Then taking derivatives we obtain $d\phi_u : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^k$ and $d\psi_v : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^l$, and we have $$TM_x = d\phi_u[\mathbb{R}^m] \ \ \text{ and } \ \ d\psi_v[\mathbb{R}^n] = TN_{f(x)}$$
and it follows that $TM_x \cong \mathbb{R}^m$ and $TN_{f(x)} \cong \mathbb{R}^n$. Definition $(2)$ - Assigning directional derivatives However the other definition of the derivative can be defined as follows. Now we don't know if $M$ is open or not in $\mathbb{R}^k$. So we have two cases to look at Case 1: $M$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^k$ The derivative of $f$ in the direction $h \in \mathbb{R}^k$, taken at the point $x \in M$ is defined by the conventional limit $$df_x(h) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(x + th) - f(x)}{t}$$ Now with $x$ fixed, we define $$df_x : \mathbb{R^k} \to \mathbb{R^l}$$ by assigning to each vector $h \in \mathbb{R}^k$ the directional derivative $df_x(h) \in \mathbb{R}^l$, this map is called the derivative of $f$ at $x$. Case 2: $M$ is not open in $\mathbb{R}^k$ We do know that $f$ is smooth, hence for each $x \in M$, there is an open set $W \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k$ and a smooth map $F : W \to \mathbb{R}^l$, such that $F = f$ on $W \cap M$ In this case I'm not even sure how one defines the derivative of $f$ at $x$ Now in Case 1 above, clearly $\mathbb{R}^m \not\cong \mathbb{R}^k$ and $\mathbb{R}^n \not\cong \mathbb{R}^l$, unless $m = k$ and $n = l$, so how can the two definitons of the derivative of $f$ at $x$ agree for this case. Furthermore I'm not even sure how Case 2 one can define the derivative of $f$ at $x$. So how can one prove that the two definitions of the derivative are equivalent?","['derivatives', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"

2337314,Understanding information entropy,"I have tried very very hard to get a good intuitive grasp on entropy. I read all the information theoretic intuitions on the web, but I have not exactly been able to understand what information is, what does it mean to gain information. I would love a combination of intuitive and formal(!) explanation of this information aspect (so your explanation must explain why $log(1/p)$ is the correct value, since it is not always an integer so it's not exactly about representing with bits, although I'm also willing to accept an asymptotic result, similiar to Shannons theorem). In my effort I have also read the proof of Shannons theorem on decoding in order to try and get intuition from there ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%27s_source_coding_theorem ). I think I might have got some, so I'd like to verify it (this gives me intuition as to why Entropy is an important function, and how it is relevant to compressing, but I don't know how to perfectly transfer this to information intuitively, espcially since Shannons theorem talks about high probability).
So to verify I understand correctly, it seems to me that entropy (given the setting in the article, we have a sequence of IID variables) is a sort of an approximation to what we would really love to understand, which is the distribution of $P(X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,..X_n=x_n)$ , however this is very complicated (just calculating the expected value is difficult). So intead, we consider the log of this, where we can now use the strong\weak law of large numbers and understand the distribution very well, and then we can go back to what interested us with a good approximation. So my question is consisted of 3 parts: $1$ What is this information thing more formally? $2$ Is my understanding of the intuition in compressing as I wrote above correct? $3$ Is there a way to transfer this intuition (in the case that it is correct) to an information theoretic one, because assuming I'm correct about the above, I feel comfortable with this, so I would understand the information theoretic point of view well? My objective is that as many of the formulas involving entorpy will be trivial from our intuition. I will update here whenever I understand another one. Since everytihng happens with higih probability about encoding, with union bound everything will be good, I'm just going to assume it is always satisfied to make the writing smoother. For example, we easily get (using my intuition of compressing) that $H((X,Y))<=H(X)+H(Y),$ since in both cases with high probability we can encode well, therefore by union bound with high probabiliy we can encode well for both of them, and we can just concatenate the encodings. Let's see why there must be equality if they are independent. If we look at the proof of Shannons theorem, we saw there that $P(x_1,x_2..x_n)$ is about $2^{(-nH(x))}$ , and the same for $Y$ . So clearly we have $P(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,..)$ is about $2^{(-nH(x))}2^{(-nH(y))}=2^{(-n(H(x)+H(y))}$ which is what we wanted. Now let's do conditional entropy.
So given $Y$ , we want $H(X|Y)=H((X,Y))-H(Y)$ . I haven't yet figured this one out Thanks in advance.","['information-theory', 'combinatorics', 'probability-theory', 'probability-limit-theorems']"

F_{z_x}-\frac {\partial}{\partial y} F_{z_y} = 0$$ Where $F = \sqrt {1+z_x^2+z_y^2} $ The calculation does not confuse me so much as what we are actually finding.

This can also be easily seen by graphing the LHS and RHS as functions. Furthermore, we note that the solutions only occur when $x > 1$. However, after examining many of the solutions, I didn't find any rational ones. Letting $x = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p,q \in \mathbb{R}$ and $p > q$ (because $x>1$) we then have: $\frac{q}{p} = \frac{p}{q} - \left \lfloor{\frac{p}{q}}\right \rfloor$ $\frac{q}{p} = \frac{(p \mod q)}{q}$, which comes from the fact that $\frac{p}{q} - \left \lfloor{\frac{p}{q}}\right \rfloor$ basically eliminates the whole number part of $\frac{p}{q}$, and leaves the fractional part. $\frac{q^2}{p} = (p \mod q)$ However, at this point, I get stuck.

I need to find two tangent-vectorfields $\xi, \eta$ such that (i) $[\xi,\eta]=0$, but $\nabla_{\xi}\eta \neq 0$ at at least one point P (ii)$[\xi,\eta]\neq0$, but $\nabla_{\xi}\eta = 0$ at at least one point P First I calculated (for an arbitrary function $\phi$ and $\xi := \xi_1 \frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\xi_2 \frac{\partial}{\partial y}$, $\eta := \eta_1 \frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\eta_2 \frac{\partial}{\partial y}$): $[\xi,\eta] = ... = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \left[ \xi_1 \frac{\partial \eta_1}{\partial x} + \xi_2 \frac{\partial \eta_1}{\partial y}- \eta_1 \frac{\partial \xi_1}{\partial x} - \eta_2 \frac{\partial \xi_1}{\partial y}\right] + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \left[ \xi_1 \frac{\partial \eta_2}{\partial x} + \xi_2 \frac{\partial \eta_2}{\partial y}- \eta_1 \frac{\partial \xi_2}{\partial x} - \eta_2 \frac{\partial \xi_2}{\partial y}\right]$ For (ii) I get by using $\nabla_{\xi} = \nabla_{ \xi_1 \frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\xi_2 \frac{\partial}{\partial y}} = \xi_1 \nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}}+\xi_2 \nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial y}}$ for continous $\xi_i$ and $\eta_i$: $\nabla_{\xi}\eta = 0 \Leftrightarrow \xi_1(\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} <\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x},n> + \xi_2(\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} <\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y},n> = 0 $
Due to the normal vector $n$ has only a z direction because $M=\mathbb{R}^2$, the scalar product is zero and we get: $\xi_1 \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \xi_2 \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} = 0$ So the equation above simplifies to: $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \left[- \eta_1 \frac{\partial \xi_1}{\partial x} - \eta_2 \frac{\partial \xi_1}{\partial y}\right] + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \left[ - \eta_1 \frac{\partial \xi_2}{\partial x} - \eta_2 \frac{\partial \xi_2}{\partial y}\right] \neq 0$ Both of the brackets have to be nonzero, so the solution of these two equations gives the solution. Is this right so far? How, beside try and error, can I find out the solution of this equations? How does it work for (i)? In this case I can't eliminate anything from the first equation, because the second condition then is not equal Zero.

This also allows us to answer such questions as Is the set $\{(1,2),(2,5),(3,5)\}$ a function? (answer: yes) With such a definition, we could certainly go on to define a function's domain and range. The problem with this definition, however, is that it includes no notion of a codomain.  This presents a problem when we want to answer a question such as Are the functions $f:\Bbb R \to \Bbb R$ given by $f(x) = x^2$ and $g:\Bbb R \to [0,\infty)$ given by $g(x) = x^2$ the same function?

On the other hand, we would like to say that ""the function $g$ is surjective, but the function $f$ is not"".  If surjectivity is a property of functions, then the fact that $f$ and $g$ do not share this property should mean that $f \neq g$. So what gives?

[...] The tautological bundle over the projective variety $X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ is obtained by simply restricting the correspondence to the points of $X$... Later on in the text they define the hyperplane bundle as The hyperplane bundle $H$ on a quasi-projective variety is defined to be the dual of the tautological line bundle:  The fiber $\pi^{-1}(p)$ over a point $p \in X \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ is the (one-dimensional) vector space of linear functionals on the line $\ell \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ that determines $p$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$.  The formal construction of $H$ as a subvariety of $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1})^\ast \times \mathbb{P}^n$ parallels that of the tautological line bundle.

LORENZ’S EQUATIONS Birman and Williams researched the periodic orbits of the Lorenz equations and more specifically what kind of structure they have. The first part of the paper is devoted to the proof that there exist an infinite amount of in-equivalent orbits. I think that is the content of the following theorem: The collapsing map $q$ is bijective on the union of all the periodic orbits. I get the first part of the proof, that the strongly stable manifold $W^{ss}(x)$ ($x$ is a periodic point) does not intersect any other periodic orbits or itself. But then the proof talks about this process of collapsing and deformation. The collapsing has been touched upon in the section leading up to this theorem (bottom of page 52 of the paper), but I don't understand how we get a mapping from this process. I have no clue how I should interpret this deformation ($H_s$) they talk talk about. It hasn't been mentioned before and I couldn't find it in the references for the section. Did I completely miss it? Finally, I am having difficulties with how exactly the proof proves that it is a bijection. I feel that the proof is really hand-wavy and since I am not really familiar with the material this makes it quite difficult to correctly parse the proof, as there are so many details missing.

The reason for my conjecture is that $$ \int_0^1\frac{\ln^2(1+x)\ln x}x \; dx =\frac{\pi^4}{24}-\frac16\ln^42+\frac{\pi^2}6\ln^22-\frac72\zeta(3)\ln2-4\operatorname{Li}_4\!\left(\frac12\right) $$ and as shown here on Math StackExchange $$ \int_0^1\frac{\ln^3(1+x)\ln x}x \; dx = \frac{\pi^2}3\ln^32-\frac25\ln^52+\frac{\pi^2}2\zeta(3)+\frac{99}{16}\zeta(5)-\frac{21}4\zeta(3)\ln^22\\-12\operatorname{Li}_4\left(\frac12\right)\ln2-12\operatorname{Li}_5\left(\frac12\right).$$ The Riemann zeta function obeys $$ \zeta_n = \operatorname{Li}_n(1) $$ and $\pi^{2n}$ is a rational number times $\zeta_{2n}$.  Also, $$ \operatorname{Li}_1(x) = -\ln(1 - x) .$$ So, the two integrals above are polynomials with rational coefficients in constants of the form $\operatorname{Li}_n(x)$ where $n$ is a natural number, $x$ is rational, and $\mathrm{Li}_n$ is the $n$th polylogarithm .

and since countable sum of measures is itself a measure (see, e.g., here ) we are done. I'm not sure though that this is right. Another option is to state straightforward that
$$\mu(A) =\int_{S}\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbb 1_{s_i \in A}dx(s), $$

Moreover, all increments are independent of $F\in \mathscr{F}_{\sigma +}$.

2338172,Rate of convergence for filtration and conditional expectations,"I've cross-posted this question at Mathoverflow with the hope of generating more ideas. Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F},P)$ be a probability space and $(\mathcal{F}_n)_n$ a filtration that increases to $\mathcal{F}$. Is there a way to quantify the ""rate of convergence"" of $\mathcal{F}_n \uparrow \mathcal{F}?$ I'll now try to clarify the question by explaining its motivation. I was wondering what can be said about the rate of convergence in Levy's martingale convergence theorem. By that result, for an integrable random variable $X$ we have
$$E(X \mid \mathcal{F}_n) \to X$$
almost surely. I was wondering if we can make a statement like
$$P(|E(X \mid \mathcal{F}_n) - X| > \epsilon) = O(n^{-a})$$
under fairly general assumptions. As pointed out to me by Bananach in this question , it's hopeless to expect the rate to be independent of the particular filtration because we can replace $\mathcal{F}_n$ with 
$$\bar{\mathcal{F}_n} = \mathcal{F}_{\sqrt{n}}$$
(rounding to the nearest integer), and obtain a new filtration for which conditional expectations converge more slowly. But perhaps if we knew ""how quickly"" $\mathcal{F}_n$ increases to $\mathcal{F}$, we could find a rate of convergence of conditional expectations that depends on the ""rate of convergence"" of the filtration. An example is given in Michael's answer to the same question that I linked to above. Let $X$ be uniformly distributed on $[-1,1]$, assume $\mathcal{F} = \sigma(X)$, and define
$$Z_n = X \mathbf{1}_{|X|>2^{-n}} \ \ \text{and} \ \ \mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(Z_n,...,Z_1).$$
Then, 
$$E(X \mid \mathcal{F}_n) = X \mathbf{1}_{|X|>2^{-n}} \to X,$$
and
$$P(|E(X \mid \mathcal{F}_n) - X)| > \epsilon) = 2^{-n}.$$ Another, trivial, example is $\mathcal{F} = \sigma(X)$ and $\mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(X)$ for all $n$, and then
$$E(X \mid \mathcal{F}_n) = X.$$ 
The filtration converges ""instantly"" and so do the conditional expectations. The examples suggest that the rate of convergence of the conditional expectations is the same as the ""rate of convergence"" of the filtration. Can this idea be made precise in general?","['reference-request', 'probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation', 'measure-theory']"
2338274,Which properties do elementary transformations on a matrices not preserve?,"In the book of Linear Algebra by Werner Greub at page 96, it is given that; The elementary transformations on a matrix are: (1.1.)

xj(j\not =i). (11.2.) Adding to a vector $Y_k$ an arbitrary multiple of a vector $Y_l (l \not = k)$ . It is easy to see that the four above
transformations have the following effect on the matrix $M (\phi)$ : (1.1.) Interchange of the rows i and j. (1.2.) Interchange of the
columns k and I. (11.1.) Replacement of the row-vector $a_i$ by $a_i+$ $\lambda a_j(j\not =i).$ (11.2.) Replacement of the column-vector $b_k$ by $b_k+\lambda b_l(l\not=k).$ I have no problem in understanding the operations, but what I'm asking is that what do those operations preserve, especially, in the view that they are matrix representations of linear mappings of vector spaces ? For example, though I haven't studied in details, in Gaussian elimination, basically we are applying these elementary transformations to the coefficient matrix of a system of equations, and in the book, it says that after those operations, the given system is equivalent to the old one. I don't know how because I don't know what the transformations do and do not preserve when we applied them to a matrix. Another example, in 11.2 when we add $\lambda b_l$ to the kth row, $\phi$ maps the kth bases to $\phi_{old} (x_k) + \lambda \phi (x_l)$ , so the image has change, hence the map has changed, at least according to me.

In this problem we have two points in 2D space, where the second is below and to the right of the first, and we have to draw a curve between the two points such that the time it takes a ball to roll down the curve is minimized. From a calculus of variations viewpoint, we want to find a function $f:[x_1, x_2] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with given boundary conditions $f(x_1) = y_1, f(x_2) = y_2$ that minimizes a functional $T[f]$ that represents the time it takes for the ball to roll down the curve. I'm stuck trying to figure out what exactly this functional should be. It's pretty easy to calculate the speed of the ball rolling down the curve at any given position, using potential and kinetic energy. We can also calculate the acceleration using the slope of curve. My question is, given this information, how exactly do we get the time it takes the ball to get from one point to another? I've found a few sources that calculate this functional explicitly, and they end up with the following expression:
$$ T[f] = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \sqrt{\frac{1+(f'(x))^2}{2gf(x)}} dx $$
where $g$ is the gravitational constant. This is usually derived by first expressing the time as:
$$ T[f] = \int \frac{ds}{v} $$
However, I don't really understand how this expression is obtained, and using the arc length formula $ ds = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2} $ doesn't feel very rigorous at all.

$$1,\ a,\ a^2,\dots,a^n.$$
This can be reduced further by assuming that $a^m=1$ for some $m\leq n$, and $a=1$ reduces the number to $1$. Making all $a_i$ equal is not the only way to get $n+1$, taking $a_2=a_1^{-1}$ also does it for $n=2$, say. Question: it seems that if none of $a_i$ is a root of unity then $n+1$ is the lowest number. How does one prove that?

constant $c > 0$ such that 
$| f ( x  ) - f( y ) | \leq 
c  \, \|  x - y  \|,   \forall  x , y \in K$. My approach: Let $x,y\in K$ be two arbitrary points. Then, since $K$ is convex, the line segment between $x$ and $y$, i.e. $Co(x,y)$, is in $K$. Thus, by MVT, there exists a vector $b\in Co(x,y)$ such that $$\text{(*) } |f(x)-f(y)|=|\langle x-y, (\nabla f)(b)\rangle|\le \|x-y\|\|(\nabla f)(b)\|$$ Now, since $K$ is compact, $f$ takes a maximum and a minimum values on $K$, so that $\exists b'\in K$ such that $\|(\nabla f)(b') \|\ge \|(\nabla f)(b) \|$, for all $b\in K$. Let $c\in \mathbb{R}$, $c:=(\nabla f)(b')$, then $$|f(x)-f(y)|\le\|x-y\|\|(\nabla f)(b)\|\le\|x-y\|\|(\nabla f)(b')\|=c\|x-y\|$$ This implies that $f$ is Lipschitz on $K$ for all $x,y\in K$.

Previously, I thought I had my question answered when I asked a question of this nature here. The answer was comprehensive and informative, but I thought that this logic should apply to all integration by trig substitution integrals. Since $\sqrt{1-x^2}$ and $\sin\ y$ both have the same domain, assuming $x$ and $y$ are real numbers this is totally valid to substitute. However, the domains of my substitution and the function are different here, as the domain of $x= \frac{\sin\ \theta}{5}$ is valid for all real numbers. Granted, the range of $(2)$ is almost the domain of $(1)$ except $(2)$ is inclusive $[1/5,1/5]$. So what gives?

On rearranging we get, $$p= \frac x {1-Kx} - x$$ Here, $p$ is a function of $x$ and is therefore not constant. Now, $$\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} p(x) = 0$$ The period falls to zero as $x$ tends to zero.
