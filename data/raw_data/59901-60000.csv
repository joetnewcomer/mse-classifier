My thoughts: I immediately assumed we had the following $x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(x\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)-x\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)+x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(y\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)-y\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)+…$ where I've used the standard commutation relations. However I'm now unsure as to whether it should actually be $x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(x\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-x\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(x\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(y\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}-y\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(x\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+…$ This has confused me slightly because in Quantum Mechanics I would usually have done the former calculation and perhaps applied this to some function $f$. This is a differential geometry question where we're considering vector fields and (I'm assuming) these objects commute. I'm now tending towards the latter though because it makes the calculation a lot easier! So help with this particular problem would be great. But also an explanation of whether this would differ if we had operators (in QM for instance) and whether the correct method of the two above is $\textit{always}$ the one to use (if we're considering the commutations of differentials $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$) would be perfect.","['vector-fields', 'differential-geometry']"
666468,Forcing the discriminant of an integral basis to be a Carmichael number.,"I was thinking about the following lemma recently. Lemma : Let $K=\mathbb{Q}(\theta)$ for some algebraic number $\theta$ and let $n=[K:\mathbb{Q}]$. If $\{\tau_1, \,\dots\,, \tau_n\}$ consists of algebraic integers and the discriminant $\Delta_{K} [\tau_1 ,\, \dots \,, \tau_n]$ is squarefree, then $\{\tau_1,\, \dots\, ,\,\tau_n\}$ is an integral basis for the ring of algebraic integers $\mathcal{O}_{K}$. [NB: The converse is not true : consider, for example, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-5})$ with integral basis $\{1, \sqrt{-5}\}$ s.t. $\Delta_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})} (1, \sqrt{-5})=-20$.] It got me thinking about Carmichael numbers (simply because they're squarefree) and so I came up with this question: How do we restrict $K$ and an integral basis $\mathcal{B}=\{\tau_1,\, \dots\, ,\, \tau_n\}$ for $K$ so that the discriminant $\Delta_{K} (\tau_1,\, \dots \,,\, \tau_n)=C$ is a Carmichael number? I don't have any coherent ideas, I'm afraid; I hope you don't mind. I've looked around online but I couldn't find anything. Thoughts : Looking at the definition of $\Delta_{K}$, we might have to restrict the conjugation maps somewhat to make the prime divisors of $C$ pop out. A Frustrated Sub-question: Do such discriminants even exist? I'm looking at $\sqrt{\pm 561}$ and similar numbers to see if I can find one. See my comments below for a description of a similar attempt that might require a computer programme. Why is this interesting?

666485,How would you explain confidence intervals to a beginner with very weak algebra skills,"Let us say that you are taking AP Statistics. The prerequisite is a passing grade of D or above in Algebra II. The kids that you are working with struggle with algebra and do not retain information very well. Even though you spent a month talking about z-scores and how to find them using the invNorm() function a lot of them are still confused as to what to do and need someone to spoonfeed them with simplified information that does not contain too many technical terms. Your challenge now is to teach them confidence intervals which involve dealing with a) the concept b) the math c) the interpretation and finally the d) misconceptions. As you can see, this is an uphill battle and what worsens it is the student apathy. You review how to find the corresponding z-scores of the middle 95th percentile using the invNorm() function. You explain that the first entry must be the area to the left however when they see $z_{\alpha}$ they think the area to the right. This has been an ongoing confusion for one month despite you repeating the same thing over weeks. Now you try giving them a motivating example: ""Lets say you wanted to figure out the population mean length of all the world's bald eagles' wingspan. This is our parameter. Remember a parameter is a numerical value assigned to a whole population. You take a sample of 100 bald eagles and measure their wingspan. We call this sample mean a point estimate. Do you guys think that this point estimate accurately reflects the population mean?"" (Introducing vocabulary) You transition into talking about 95% confidence intervals conceptually. They are lost. Then you present them this formula. They are now completely and hopelessly lost: $ \bar{x} - z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sigma < \mu < \bar{x} + z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\sigma $ You draw a picture showing that the level of confidence is $1-\alpha$ and the remaining areas we don't want are $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ and $\frac{\alpha}{2}$.

This is what I have, how does it look? Proof: Let $P(x)$ be any polynomial. Then we can write $P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0$. Hence, we have, by linearity of the integral, that $\int\limits_{0}^{1} f(x)P(x) dx$ $= \int\limits_{0}^{1} f(x) (a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0) dx$ $= a_n \int\limits_{0}^{1} f(x)x^n dx + ... + a_1 \int\limits_{0}^{1} f(x) x dx + a_o \int\limits_{0}^{1} f(x) x^0 dx$ $=0$. By the Weierstrass Theorem (Theorem 7.26, Pg. 159, Rudin.), we see that there exists a sequence of polynomials $P_n$ such that $P_n(x) \rightarrow f(x)$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. By the above, we have that $\int\limits_{0}^{1} f(x)P_n(x) dx = 0$ for all $n \ge 1$. By Theorem 7.16 (Pg. 151, Rudin.), because this convergence is uniform, we can interchange limits and integration and obtain $0 = \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int\limits_{0}^{1} f(x) P_n(x) dx = \int\limits_{0}^{1} \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} f(x) P_n(x) dx = \int\limits_{0}^{1} f^2(x) dx$. But, $f^2(x) \ge 0$ for all $x \in [0,1]$ and since $f^2$ is continuous (because $f$ is and so is the function $x^2$) we must have that $f^2(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [0,1]$, because otherwise it would be nonzero in some neighborhood within $[0,1]$ by continuity, hence the integral would be positive because it would be positive over that neighborhood and greater than or equal to zero over the rest of $[0,1]$. But, $f^2 = 0$ on $[0,1] \implies f = 0$ on $[0,1]$. Q.E.D.","['sequences-and-series', 'continuity', 'proof-verification', 'analysis', 'uniform-continuity']"

666964,The Probability of Catching Criminals,"I have been struggling with the following question and would greatly appreciate any help  :) Suppose we have information about the supermarket purchases of 100 million people. Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. This is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals? We must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly... Here is how I've been going about solving it: Number of possible pairs of people: $\binom{10^6}{2} = \frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large. Number of possible 10-item selections: $\binom{10^3}{10} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{23}$ Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:
$\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$ Probability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}}$ Probability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\frac{100}{2.6 \times 10^{23}})^2 = (\frac{1}{2.6 \times 10^{21}})^2 = \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}}$ The expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus: $ 5 \times 10^{11} \times \frac{1}{6.76 \times 10^{42}} = \frac{5}{6.75 \times 10^{31}}$ Because the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case.

Prove that, for any number of rings, the transfer can be made in exactly $2^n-1$ moves. We need to use induction... Basis Step IF we let $n=1$, then the left hand side must be 1 and the right hand side must be one as well. $1 = 2^1-1$ $1 = 1$ Induction Step.

Then, $2(2^k-1)+1$ Using our induction hypothesis, we have $2(2^{k+1}-1)$. For any $ k \geq 1$, $P(k)$ and $P(k+1)$ is true. Edit: This isn't right at all... it's just fluff...I need to start over. Can the Tower of Hanoi be played in less than $2^n-1$ steps? This is where I'm stuck... My guess is that unless you break the rules of the game, then you can't play  in fewer steps.

667091,Is line element mathematically rigorous?,"I know differentials (in a way of standard analysis) are not very rigorous in mathematics, there are a lot of amazing answers here on the topic. But what about line element? $$ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 +dz^2 $$ The way I think about this line element is being geometrically constructed from Pythagoras theorem as:
$$\Delta s^2 =\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2 +\Delta z^2$$
and then we assume that we can 'get' these quantities ($\Delta x$) to be infinitesimally small (as small as we like) and represent as $dx$ instead, right? Now then lets take line element on a sphere:
$$ds_2 ^2=r^2sin^2(\theta)d\phi^2 + r^2d\theta ^2$$ It is geometrically constructed again using Pythagoras theorem and assuming that sides of a 'triangle' are small: $$\Delta s_2 ^2 \approx (rsin(\theta)\Delta \phi)^2 + (r\Delta\theta)^2$$ But this approximation never really becomes equality, the smaller the angles the better it works, but still never equality! People just replace $\Delta->d$ and say $ds$ and say it's differential. I guess my question is this: when we write something like
$$ds_2 ^2=r^2sin^2(\theta)d\phi^2 + r^2d\theta ^2$$
we actually have in mind that this quantity contains higher order terms, but they will vanish after we parametrise?
I think about parametrisation in a way:
$$\frac{ds_2^2}{dt^2}=r^2sin^2(\theta)\frac{d\phi^2}{dt^2} + r^2\frac{d\theta^2}{dt^2}$$","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'differential-forms', 'infinitesimals', 'differential']"
667107,On which structures does the free group 'naturally' act?,"One of the best ways to get a handle on a group is to recognize it as isomorphic to a set of symmetries of some structure. The dihedral group of order $2n$ is easily recognized as the set of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon, the symmetric group as the permutations of a set, the Klein-four group as the symmetries of the 'cross'---one pair of opposing prongs are longer than the other pair. The previous descriptions are also in a sense 'exhaustive': every 'sensible' symmetry you could conceive of those structures is represented by some element of the group. An example where the group is not exhaustive over its structure is $C_n$ over the regular $n$-gon (reflection is missing), or $A_n$ over the set of $n$ elements. I wish to know of a structure that a free group---specifically $F_2$---naturally acts on which it is also in a sense 'exhaustive'. I'm aware of $F_2$'s Cayley graph, but I want other examples. EDIT The question may have been a bit unfair and imprecise, but I can't help that it is really.
One of the reasons it may be unfair is that 'exhaustive' is a bit subjective. For example, I myself cannot point out a structure that $C_n$ naturally acts on that $D_{2n}$ could not be conceived of as acting on also; however, both of these groups also sit in $S_n$ in a more-or-less canonical fashion. But there are structures, such as polygons, that we think of as $D_{2n}$ acting on naturally rather than $S_n$. I'm trying to find structures such that when we think of their 'natural' set of symmetries, the group of these symmetries would be isomorphic to a free group. I want a
couple of examples, as I'm slightly disappointed in having only the Cayley graph or finite tuples of words as a reference. Other groups have many examples of acting on a structure. For example the Klein four group could also be realized as the symmetries of a proper rectangle, $A_4$ can be realized as the rigid motions of the tetrahedron rather than the even permutations of a 4-element set. I also don't want these examples to be 'cheap'. What I mean by this is that the action is not arrived at by quotienting by a normal subgroup to get an action that is more properly realized by another group.","['infinite-groups', 'geometric-group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'soft-question', 'group-theory']"
667117,"Why is the ""topologist's sine curve"" not locally connected?","In Munkres's Topology, it is claimed that ""The topologist's sine curve"" is not locally connected without further explanation (See Example 3 of Section 25 ""Components and Local Connectedness"", 2nd edition). The topologist's sine curve: Let $S$ denote the following subset of the plane. $$S = \{ (x, \sin(1/x)) \mid 0 < x \le 1\}.$$ The set $\bar{S}$ is called the topologist's sine curve, which equals the union of $S$ and the vertical interval $0 \times [-1,1]$. An explanation that it is not locally connected can be found here . The topologist's sine curve is not locally connected: take a point $(0, y) \in \bar{S}, y \neq 0$. Then any small open ball at this point will contain infinitely many line segments from $S$. This cannot be connected, as each one of these is a component, within the neighborhood.

667154,Additional ways of defining real powers.,"I am familiar with the following 3 way of defining real powers: Given $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$, such that $x\gt0$, we can define
$$
 x^y =
   \begin{cases}
     \sup_{\,q\in\mathbb{Q}}\{x^q :q\le y\} &;\ 1\le x\\
\\
     \inf_{\,q\in\mathbb{Q}}\{x^q :q\le y\} &;\ 0\lt x\lt 1\\
   \end{cases}
$$ Using the theory of integration, we define for $x\gt0$:
$$
\ln x:=\int_1^x{\frac{dt}{t}}
$$
We can then show, using this definition, that $\ln x$ has all the familiar identities of logarithms. In addition we can show that $\ln x$ is a bijection, and has an inverse which we define as $e^x$. We then define for any $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$, such that $x\gt0$:
$$
x^y :=e^{y\ln x}
$$
And show that this definition coincides with the definition of rational powers (using the identities of logarithms). Using the theory of series' we can show that the series:
$$
e^x:=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{\frac{x^k}{k!}}
$$
converges for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$. Then, similarily to definition 2, we show that $e^x$ is a bijection and define it's inverse as $\ln x$. Finally we define for any $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$, such that $x\gt0$:
$$
x^y :=e^{y\ln x}
$$
We can then proceed to show as before that the familiar identities of the exponent hold, and thus the definition coincides with the rational powers. My question has two parts: First off, while these definitions coincide (meaning that for a given $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ all definitions give the same value for $x^y$), can the definitions themselves be derived from a simpler basis. Or, in other words, are all three definitions different descriptions of the same underlying definition, deriving from the same axioms?

I was pondering in the bath what might be the most convenient set of options if there were five or seven possibilities.

Or show that $\nabla^2 u(x,y)=\partial u = \partial^2u/\partial x^2 + \partial^2 u/\partial x^2  =0$. Part b) can be found by either taking $v=\text{Im}(z e^z) =e^x(x\sin y+y\cos y)$, or integrate the Cauchy-Riemann equations. I have two ""proofs"" for c) and I am quite unsure about the finer works in both of them. Note that if $h(\theta)$ denotes the integrand then $u(\cos \theta,\sin \theta)=h(\theta)$. We know that there exists a function $f$ such that $f = u + iv$, and $f$ is analytic.
The path integral over some closed curve is zero, over an analytic function. So the following should hold
$$
\oint_C f\,\mathrm{d}s = \oint_C u\,\mathrm{d}s + i \oint_C v\,\mathrm{d}s = 0\,,
$$
where $C$ is some closed curve. This means that
$$
\oint_C u\,\mathrm{d}s = \frac{1}{i} \oint_C v
$$
What I want to say is that both line integrals are reall, so the left handside 
is imaginary and the right handside is real. My argument for this is that both $u$ and $v$ lives in $C^\infty$ and hence has no singularities in $\mathbb{C}$. Is this correct? Is there any better argument that both integrals are real? Assume that the integrals are real, then the only possibility for the equation to hold is if both integrals are zero. if we take $C$ to be the unit circle, then we can parametrize the integral over u 
$$
\oint_{|z|=1} u\,\mathrm{d}s = \int_0^{2\pi} u(e^{i \theta})|i e^{i \theta}| \mathrm{d}\theta = \int_0^{2\pi} h(\theta)\,\mathrm{d}\theta = 0
$$ 
Not quite sure how I should parametrize the integral such that it becomes real. I do not quite see why $u(e^{i\theta})$ equals $h(\theta)$, the first integral lives in $\mathbb{C}$ and the second in $\mathbb{R}$. Could I instead have integrated $z = u + i v$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ instead of $\mathbb{C}$
since they are isomorphic? It seems somewhat strange, but atleast then the parametrization of $\oint u$ will be real. My proffesor said I could use the maximul value principle to evalute this integral. 
But again this integral lives in $\mathbb{C}$ and $h(\theta)$ lives in \mathbb{R}^2. 
Otheriwise I see why that principle works, since $u(0,0)=0$. Any inputs or suggestions for making my argument work, or a similar argument would be much appreaciated.

The prime number theorem tells us that if $\pi(x)=|\{p\in\mathscr P\colon p\leq x\}|$ then $\pi(x)\sim \frac{x}{\log x}$. Now one could think about the fact that $\mathbb Z$ is a Dedekind domain and $\mathscr P$ can be seen as the set of prime ideals in $\mathbb Z$. So the function $\pi(x)$ can be thought as a way of counting prime ideals whose norm is not greater than $x$. If $K$ is a number field, $\mathcal O_K$ its number ring and $\mathscr P_K$ the set of its prime ideals, we are in a very similar situation: we have a Dedekind domain and for each prime ideal $\mathfrak p\in \mathscr P_K$ the norm $N(\mathfrak p)$ of $\mathfrak p$ is well defined, being $|\mathcal O_K/\mathfrak p|$. Moreover, for each $n\in \mathbb N$ there is a finite number of (prime) ideals of norm $n$. So the question is: what can I say asymptotically about the function $\pi_K$ defined as $\pi_K(x)=|\{\mathfrak p\in \mathscr P_K\colon N(\mathfrak p)\leq x \}|$? For example if $K$ is a quadratic field, then there are $\pi(x)$ rational primes which are $\leq x$. Half of them remain prime in $K$ so they have norm $p^2$, so I expect them to contribute for $\pi(\sqrt{x})/2$ to $\pi_K(x)$, while the other half splits in $K$ in $2$ prime ideals each of which of norm $p$, so I am expecting this other half to contribute for $2\cdot \pi(x)/2=\pi(x)$ to $\pi_K(x)$. Would that be correct? And finally, if $A$ is any Dedekind domain such that there are only finitely many prime ideals of a fixed norm (is this always the case?), is there any kind of general result about $\pi_A(x)=|\{\mathfrak p\in \mathscr P_A\colon N(\mathfrak p)\leq x\}|$?","['analytic-number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

667474,Submartingality of generalized stochastic exponential of a BMO martingale,"I attended a talk today on BMO martingales. It was my first encounter with the subject, and this may explain my inability to solve this myself. We take a continuous local martingale $L$, and say that $L\in BMO$ if $E[\langle L\rangle_{\infty}-\langle L\rangle_T|\mathcal{F}_T]\leq C$ for any stopping time $T$ and an absolute constant $C$. We define then $G_t^L(\alpha)=\exp\left(\alpha L_t+\left(\frac12-\alpha\right)\langle L\rangle_t\right)$        $\qquad (0\leq t<\infty)$. Now comes the problem. He wrote down that $E[G_t^L(\alpha)|\mathcal{F}_T]\geq G_T^L(\alpha)$, for some $\alpha\neq 1$ called it trivial and moved on in his agenda. In other words, we need that $E\left[ \exp\left( \alpha L_t+\left.\left( \frac12-\alpha\right)\langle L\rangle_t\right)\right| \mathcal{F}_T\right]\geq \exp\left(\alpha L_T+\left(\frac12-\alpha\right)\langle L\rangle_T\right)$. What immediately comes to my mind with submartingality is to use the Jensen inequality. This gets me next to nowhere.  Obviously, I need to apply some property of the BMO martingale to get there, but every result I find on the subject (John-Nirenberg inequality, reverse Hölder inequality, etc.) pulls me in the wrong direction, so to speak. I have also tried seeking help in texts on analysis (Muckenhoupt, Fefferman...) but to no avail. With the lecturer noting that the result is trivial, I suspect it's just me making this problem more complicated than it really is. Now, corollary 6 in this article combined with theorem 6 of this article leads me to believe that his claim may well be true, but I can neither prove it myself nor find a reference on it.

I am not asking if there is a construction of the p-adic numbers that uses the ordering of the rationals (which is how Dedekind's approach to $\mathbb{R}$ works).

y+a  \end{array} \right) =
  \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
x  \\
y  \end{array} \right) +

a  \\
b  \end{array} \right) $ form a two parameter lie group (I presume) with addition of column as the composition rule. If that is so, how do I go about finding the generators of this transformation.
I know the generators of translation are linear momenta in the corresponding directions. But I am not able to see this here. PS :  In my course I have been taught that the generators are found by calculating the Taylor expansion of the group element about the Identity of the group. For instance, $\operatorname{SO}(2)$ group 
$$ M =   \left( \begin{array}{cc}
\cos \:\phi & -\sin \:\phi \\
\sin \:\phi &  \cos \:\phi \end{array} \right) $$

$$ \frac{\partial M}{\partial \phi}\Bigg|_{\phi=0} = 
 \left( \begin{array}{cc}
0  & -1 \\
1 &  0 \end{array} \right) $$ Now if I exponentiate this, I can obtain back the group element. My question how do I do this for Translation group. EDIT :This edit is to summarise and get a view of the answers obtained. Firstly, the vector representation of the translation group (for 2D) would in general have the form : 
$$ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & a_x\\ 0 & 1 & a_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\ $$
with generators (elements of Lie algebra)

T_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & i \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\  $$ Secondly, the scalar-field representation of the same is given by the differential operators
$$ exp^{ i(a_x\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+ a_y\frac{\partial}{\partial y} )} $$
with generators 
$$ T_x^s = i\frac{\partial}{\partial x},\;\;T_y^s = i\frac{\partial}{\partial y} $$ The Lie algebra is two-dimensional and abelian : $ [T_x,T_y] = 0$","['symmetry', 'lie-algebras', 'group-theory']"

Or, what is on earth the  reason make these two concepts so close such that one can usually replaced one by the other.

(3)From algebraic geometry perspective, I could understand the projective condition: it benefits people to start proof from a projective space.

667830,"Modern research into Grassman's ""theory of forms""?","I quote from Petsche's Hermann Graßmann: Biography (emphasis mine): The mathematical part of the book begins with the conception of the “General Theory of Forms”. Starting with a perspective on mathematics as a theory of forms, Graßmann analyses in the most abstract way possible the general structures of concrete “conjunctions of forms”. Here, he places special emphasis on “elementary conjunctions”, demanding they have module properties, that is, associativity, commutativity and an inverse and neutral element. The so-defined conjunction of the first order, or “formal addition”, is then followed up by an investigation of a conjunction of the second order (“formal multiplication”), for which 
  he only requires distributivity with respect to formal addition. Graßmann directly posits 
  the validity of the module properties for formal addition and distributivity for formal 
  multiplication as the principles for constructing these conjunctions: “This generally is the 
  way”, he wrote, “that initially, that is when no species of conjunction is yet given, such a 
  conjunction of next higher order is defined.” Since Graßmann does not require the forms generated by conjunctions of the second order to be embedded in the fundamental domain, he can use this form of conjunction for the formal generation of new mathematical objects in the further course of the 
  text. ... After Graßmann has laid down the foundation for all mathematical disciplines by 
  presenting these uniquely generalized group-theoretical and structural abstractions he starts with the actual presentation of his new mathematical discipline. What is the modern terminology for Grassmann's ""General Theory of Forms""? What research work has been done in order to continue this line of thinking? Which resources could I acquaint myself with in order to answer these questions? I think the answer is simply (and very generally, thus unhelpfully) ""universal algebra"": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure Am I on the right track? I am not sure. See also this question of mine, which is looking for something similar in spirit. See also (again, unsure of the relevancy): http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.3349v1.pdf Can someone with familiarity weave together a proper answer from these three resources and others as appropriate?","['self-learning', 'reference-request', 'abstract-algebra']"

These two side lengths are equal in length to one another and the other diagonal: So far I've been able to express the values of the sides opposite to a and b in terms of the known side lengths and the angles, but I don't know how I can relate this to the (dashed) diagonal length, because this quadrilateral will not always be a parallelogram or a kite. Furthermore, the two diagonals wouldn't always intersect at their midpoints.

667848,Is this a correct Monte-Carlo expression for $\pi$?,"I have a bicycle with one of those O-locks on it and too often when I park the bike and I want to lock it, the lock hits one of the spokes of the rim. This can be frustrating and surprises me that it occurs so often. I mean, the spokes are so thin and not that many really so one would think that this should not happen that often (like every day or so). And so every time this happened I reminded myself to calculate the probability of this happening . I just did it (after a year) and now I want to know what you guys think about my calculation, is it OK? This is not a textbook example so there is no answer to look up or anything, that's why I need your feedback. I have modeled the situation as shown in the figure below, where I have included one spoke only. Let the O-lock have diameter $d_{L}$ and the spoke have a diameter $d_S$. Let $R$ denote the ""radius"" from center of wheel to the point where the O-lock comes and goes (this is approximately equal to the radius of the rim). Then, we have that the corresponding angles are given by $w_S=d_S/R$ and $w_L = d_L/R$ so that the spoke will hit the lock (the shaded disk in figure below) when $\theta$ is in the interval $[0, w_L+w_S]$ modulo $2\pi$ (See figure: $R$ is fixed so the point $(R,\theta)$ is on a circle). Then the probability for hit (wheel with one spoke) is given by 
$$ P(1) = \frac{w_L+w_S}{2\pi}\times 1 = \frac{1}{2\pi R}(d_L+d_S).$$ Generalizing to $N$ equally spaced spokes we get 
$$ P(N) =\begin{cases} \frac{N}{2\pi R}(d_L+d_S)& \text{for } N=0,1\dots\\1 & \text{for } N\geq M= \Big\lceil\frac{2\pi R}{d_L+d_S}\Big\rceil\end{cases}. $$ Example: plugging in some typical numbers; $N=36, R\approx 0.3$m, $d_S\approx 2\times 10^{-3}$m , $d_L\approx \times 10^{-2}$m we find $$P(36) \approx 0.23$$ which kind of agrees with my everyday experience of this problem. I guess one could obtain a (Monte-Carlo)-value for $\pi$ this way? Could someone tell me what I have done wrong above? Or perhaps derive the correct expression for the probability?",['probability']

Then we obtain $$f(x,y) = \arctan \frac xy + g(y)$$ We can now differentiate with respect to $y$ and obtain $$\frac {\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac {-x}{x^2 + y^2} + g'(y)$$ If we equate this to the second initial equation, we can conclude $g(y) = C$. A similar approach beginning with the second initial equation we get $f(x,y) = - \arctan \frac yx + K$.

667938,Every subgroup of a finite group is contained in a maximal subgroup.,"So I want to prove that every subgroup of a finite group is contained in a maximal subgroup. Let $G$ be a finite group, then we can say that $|G|  = n \in \mathbb{N}$. Now let $H_1 < G$ If there exists no $H_2 < G: H_1 < H_2 < G$ then we are done since $H_1$ is maximal and is contained in itself. This should be ok, right? In the case where such a $H_2$ exists, we have $H_1 < H_2 < G$. If $H_2$ is maximal we are done and so on... By Lagrange theorem we have that $|H_1|$ divides $|H_2|$ and $|H_2|$ divides $|G|$. (in the general setting of a chain of proper subgroups we have that $|H_i|$ divides $|H_{i+1}|$) But $|G| =n$ has a unique and distinct prime factorization which implies that we can not have a infinite chain of proper subgroups: $H_1 < H_2 < H_3 < ... < G$ between some $H_i$ and $G$. Since $|H_{i+1}| > |H_{i}|$ for every subgroup in the chain. That is, we can not have a infinite number of divisors of $n$ so there must exists a maximal $H_r < G$ in which our $H_1$ is contained (and all other $H_i$ in the chain). This is messy and not very rigorous but is it plain out wrong or am I on the right track?

667939,Singular continuous functions,"A function $f:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is called singular continuous, if it is nonconstant, nondecreasing, continuous and $f^\prime(t)=0$ whereever the derivative exists. Let $f$ be a singular continuous function and $T$ the set where $f$ is not differentiable. Question: Is $T$ nowhere dense? Examples: A classical example of such a function is the so-called devil's staircase, obtained as a limit of increasing step functions constructed in a similar way as the classical Cantor set. In that case, the set in question is the Cantor set, which is closed and of measure zero, therefore nowhere dense. Another example, as suggested by David Mitra below, is the Minkowski question mark function. In that case I'm not aware of any characterization of $T$ which allows to decide whether its nowhere dense or not. If you have another (interesting) example for a singular continuous function, please give a comment. Edits/Notes/Progress: It is clear that $T$ has Lebesgue measure $0$ . In view of the correspondence of nondecreasing functions with positive measures, singular continuous functions correspond to singular continuous measures, i.e. an atomless positive Borel measures concentrated on a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
The set $T$ corresponds very roughly to that ""set of concentration"". Despite of that I would like an answer avoiding measure theory or probability language . My entire knowledge on singular continuous functions is spanned by the information contained in this question. If you possess any further insights into the concept or references containing such, please don't hesitate too leave a comment.
