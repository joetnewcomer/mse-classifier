398176,Why doesn't integrating the area of the square give the volume of the cube?,"I had a calculus course this semester in which I was taught that the integration of the area gives the size (volume): $$V = \int\limits_a^b {A(x)dx}$$ But this doesn't seem to work with the square. Since the size of the area of the square is $x^2$ then $A(x) = {x^2}$, then: $$V = \int\limits_{ - r}^r {{x^2}dx}  = \left[ {\frac{{{x^3}}}{3}} \right]_{ - r}^r = \frac{{{r^3}}}{3} - \frac{{ - {r^3}}}{3} = \frac{2}{3}{r^3}$$ It's clear that this is not the volume of the cube.

The circle has radius 1 and for the ellipse I'm able to find $x= 2 $.
$$
(x-1)^2 =9  \\
\sqrt{(x-1)^2}=\sqrt 9\\
x-1=3\\
x=4$$ For $y=2\sqrt 2$
$$
y^2=8\\
\sqrt y=\sqrt 8\\
y=\sqrt 4 \sqrt 2\\
y= 2\sqrt 2 \text{ or } 2.8 $$ So the region should be the circle? since the ellipse covers the whole circle?

398395,Prove that the dimension of the tangent space $T_x(X)$ of a k-dimensional manifold is k,"In section 2, page 9 of Guillemin and Pollack's book $\textit{Differential Topology}$, he gave a proof that the dimension of the tangent space $T_x(X)$ is equal to the dimension of the manifold $X$. However I read the proof at least 5 times and had no idea what they were talking about. ""The dimension of the vector space $T_x(X)$ is, as you expect, the dimension $k$ of $X$. To prove this, we use the smoothness of he inverse $\phi^{-1}$. Choose an open set $W$ in $\mathbf{R}^N$ and a smooth map $\Phi': \mathbf{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^k$ that extends $\phi^{-1}$. Then $\Phi'\circ\phi$ is the identity map of U, so the chain rule implies that the sequence of linear transformations $\mathbf{R}^k\xrightarrow{d\phi_0}T_x(X)\xrightarrow{d\Phi_x'}\mathbf{R}^k$ is the identity map of $\mathbf{R}^k$. It follows that $d\phi_0 :\mathbf{R}^k \rightarrow T_x(X)$ is an isomorphism, so $dim T_x(X)=k$."" Just for everyone's information, in GP's book, the convention is that $\phi$ is a diffeomorphism from $\mathbf{R}^k$ to a k-dimensional manifold $X\subset \mathbf{R}^N$ ($\phi :\mathbf{R}^k\rightarrow X$). I have two questions here: why do we need to choose an open set $W$ in $\mathbf{R}^N$ and define $\Phi'$ which extends $\phi^{-1}$? Naively I would just take $\phi^{-1}$. Then $d\phi^{-1}$ can also map $T_x(X)$ to $\mathbf{R}^k$ without problems. The map $\Phi'$ seems a bit artificial and redundant here. In fact it seems really redundant to me as when you extend $\phi^{-1}$, you actually don't care the rest of the function except for the $\phi^{-1}$ part. The proof seems only to serve as a proof that dim $T_x(X)=k$. However we know the tangent space itself is a manifold(actually a hyperplane). Why don't we find a diffeomorphism between $T_x(X)$ and $\mathbf{R}^k$? I haven't proved but I think we can use $d\phi_0$ as the diffeomorphism. Thanks a lot for everyone's help! Regards,

398534,Proof of Egoroff's Theorem,"Let $\{f_n \}$ be a sequence of measurable functions, $f_n \to f$ $\mu$-a.e. on a measurable set $E$, $\mu(E) < \infty$. Let $\epsilon>0$ be given.

That is: if we define $A = \cup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ with $\mu(A) < \epsilon $ then ${f_n}$ converges uniformly on $E \setminus A$. $\mathbf{Proof}$: (taken from Royden's Real Analysis) Let $A = \cup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \Rightarrow A \subset E$ and $\mu(A) < \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\epsilon}{2^n} = \epsilon. \mathbf{Q1}$. choose $n_0$ such that $\frac{1}{n_0} < \epsilon$.

398574,"How many points can you find on $y=x^2$, for $x \geq 0$, such that each pair of points has rational distance?","Open problem in Geometry/Number Theory.  The real question here is: Is there an infinite family of points on $y=x^2$, for $x \geq 0$, such that the distance between each pair is rational? The question of ""if not infinite, then how many?"" follows if there exists no infinite family of points that satisfies the hypothesis. We have that there exists a (in fact, infinitely many) three point families that satisfy the hypothesis by the following lemma and proof. Lemma 1: There are infinitely many rational distance sets of three points on $y=x^2$. The following proof is by Nate Dean. Proof. Let $S$ be the set of points on the parabola $y = x^2$ and let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be two fixed rational values.  For any point, $P_0(r)=(r, r^2) \in S$, let $C_1(r)$ be the circle of radius $d_1$ centered at $P_0(r)$ and let $C_2(r)$ be the circle of radius $d_2$ centered at $P_0(r)$.  Each of these circles must intersect $S$ in at least one point. Let $P_1(r)$ be any point in $C_1(r) \cap S$ and likewise, let $P_2(r)$ be any point in $C_2(r) \cap S$.  Now let $dist(r)$ equal the distance between $P_1(r)$ and $P_2(r)$. The function $dist(r)$ is a continuous function of $r$ and hence there are infinitely many values of $r$ such that $P_0(r)$, $P_1(r)$,
and $P_2(r)$ are at rational distance. $ \blacksquare $ This basically shows that the collection of families of three points that have pairwise rational distance on the parabola is dense in $S$. Garikai Campbell has shown that there are infinitely many nonconcyclic rational distance sets of four points on $y = x^2$ in the following paper: http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2004-73-248/S0025-5718-03-01606-5/S0025-5718-03-01606-5.pdf However, to my knowledge, no one has come forward with 5 point solutions, nor has it been proven that 5 point solutions even exist. But I know that many people have not seen this problem!  Does anyone have any ideas on how to approach a proof of either the infinite case or even just a 5 point solution case? Edit: The above Lemma as well as the paper by Garikai Campbell do not include the half-parabola ($x \geq 0$) restriction.  However, I thought that the techniques that he employed could be analogous to techniques that we could use to make progress on the half-parabola version of the problem.","['geometry', 'open-problem', 'rational-numbers', 'number-theory']"

398599,Constructing a conformal map from $\mathbb{D}$ to a cut plane,"Source: Oxford Exam $A2 \ 1999$ We want to construct a conformal map $F$ from the unit disc $\mathbb{D}=\{z:|z|<1\}$ to $\mathbb{C} \setminus S$ where $S$ is the half-line $\{x+i:x \in (-\infty,0] \}$ with the additional property that $F(0)=0$. Here are my thoughts, can someone see if they are correct please: Use the Möbius transformation $f_1:z \mapsto \frac{1-z}{z+1}$ to send $\mathbb{D}$ to the right half plane. Use the map $f_2:z \mapsto z+ \alpha$ where $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ we will determine later. This simply takes the right half plane to the right half plane. Use the map $f_3:z \mapsto z^2$ to map the right half plane to $\mathbb{C}$ with a cut along the negative reals. Use the map $f_4:z \mapsto z+i$ to move the cut up and map to $\mathbb{C} \setminus S$. Now the composition of these four maps is conformal so we certainly have a conformal map between the sets. We now need $F(0)=f_4 \circ f_3 \circ f_2 \circ f_1(0)=0$. $f_1(0)=1$, $f_2(1)=1+\alpha$, $f_3(1+\alpha)=\alpha^2+2\alpha+1$, $f_4(\alpha^2+2\alpha+1)=\alpha^2+2\alpha+1+i$ So we need to solve $\alpha^2+2\alpha+1+i=0$ and this is the $\alpha$ required to ensure $F(0)=0$. We can find that $\alpha=\sqrt{-i}-1$. Thus we are done. Is this correct?","['geometry', 'conformal-geometry', 'complex-analysis']"
398609,Cocartesian squares in the category of abelian groups.,"Recently, I've been doing a recap of (basic) category theory and found an old exercise I seem to be unable to solve. The question is as follows. Let $A, B$ be abelian groups, $A'<A$ and $B'<B$ subroups and $\phi:A\to B$ such that $\phi(A')\subseteq B'$. Let $\phi':A'\to B'$ and $\phi'':A/A'\to B/B'$ be the maps induced by $\phi$. Prove that the diagram \begin{array}
AA' & \to & A \\
\downarrow{\phi'} & & \downarrow{\phi} \\
B' & \to & B  
\end{array} is a cocartisian square if and only if $\phi''$ is an isomorphism. The exercise preceding this one looks like a dual statement which I did manage to prove (a similar square being cartesian iff $\phi'$ is an iso), yet just dualising the proof doesn't seem to work. That proof, however, suggests using the universal property of cocartesian squares for one of the implications ($\Rightarrow$), while using the explicit construction of pushouts in the category of abelian for the other one. The pushout of $A_1\overset{f_1}{\leftarrow} A_3 \overset{f_2}{\rightarrow} A_2$ in this category is given by $A_1\oplus A_2/\{(f_1(x),-f_2(x))\mid x\in A_3\}$.

398637,Why do injective holomorphic functions have nonzero derivative,"For some open sets $U$, $V$ in the complex plane, let $f:U\rightarrow V$ be an injective holomorphic function. Then $f'(z) \ne 0$ for $z \in U$. Now I don't understand the proof, but here it is from my text. My comments are in italics. 
Suppose $f(z_0) = 0$ for some $z_0 \in U$. $f(z) - f(z_0) = a(z - z_0)^k + G(z)$ for all $z$ near $z_0$, with $a \ne 0, k \ge 2.$
Also, $G$ vanishes to order $k+1$ at $z_0$. I'm not clear on what this ""vanishing"" thing means. Maybe it means that $G$ can be expressed as a power series of order $k+1$ around $z_0$. For sufficiently small $w$ we can write $f(z) - f(z_0) - w = F(z) + G(z)$, where $F(z) = a(z - z_0)^k - w$. I'm not sure why we need to have $w$ small. This equation will work for any $w$. Since $|G(z)| \lt |F(z)|$ on a small circle centered at $z_0$, and $F$ has at least two zeros inside that circle, Rouche's theorem implies that $f(z) - f(z_0) - w$ has a least two zeros there. Now I think that $|G(z)| \lt |F(z)|$ can follow simply from the fact that $F$ is a polynomial of degree $k$ while $G$ has degree $k+1$. And the remark about the two zeros can follow from the fact that $F$ must have $k$ zeros in the complex plane. But the first part requires that we consider $z$ only on a small circle. The second part requires that our circle be big enough to capture two zeros. How do we know that we can satisfy both? Since $f'(z) \ne 0$ for for all $z \ne z_0$ sufficiently close to $z_0$, the roots of $f(z) - f(z_0) - w$ are distinct, so $f$ is not injective - a contradiction. I think that the derivative is never zero for values of $z$ other than $z_0$ because otherwise we would have a sequence of zeros limiting towards $z_0$ which would cause our function to be constant which is a contradiction. But again we have the same problem - we can only consider a small circle. The roots of $f$ may lie outside this circle.",['complex-analysis']

Fine the airplane's distance from its point of departure and its bearing, after a  total flight time of $3.5$ hours. What I know so far , sorry I wasn't as detailed as I should be. I have drawn it out, i know distance between from the starting point and when it changes direction being $480$. And the distance of the direction change to the end point which is $640$. I know the angle where the plane changes direction totals out to $121°$. I could be wrong with this information, but the point is I've taken many different approaches at this problem but have gotten no correct answers. I've taken it ""outside of the box"" and expanded the 480 line until i can drop it down to the end point and make the spot where those two lines meet a right angle, if that makes sense. I've used ""sohcahtoa"" and found out the lengths of that small right triangle, added it with the lengths of the large obtuse triangle to put it all together. The missing side is the hypotenuse and I used the Pythagorean theorem to find it, but the answer comes out wrong. I tried so many different values and processes, and nothing.

398820,Is a curve homologous to zero according to Ahlfors actually homologous to zero?,"The presentation of the homology version of Cauchy's theorem in Ahlfors is slick, but sweeps a lot of the topology under the rug using clever arguments. This question is an attempt to reconcile Ahlfors' analytic notion of a curve being homologous to zero (presented in his book Complex Analysis and originally due to E. Artin, I believe) with the standard definition in homology as found in Hatcher. We work in the complex plane and fix $a\in \mathbb C$. Let $\gamma$ be a continuous map $[0,1]\rightarrow C\backslash \{ a\}$. Following Munkres in his book Topology , we define the winding number of $\gamma$ with respect to the point $a$ by considering $$g(t)=\frac{\gamma(t)-a}{|\gamma(t)-a|}.$$ This is clearly a loop in $S^1$ and corresponds to some multiple of of the generator of the fundamental group of $S^1$. If the generator is $\tau$ and $g(t)$ corresponds to $m\tau$, $m\in\mathbb Z$, we define the winding number $n(\gamma, a)$ to be $m$. This is the definition of winding number I will use in this question, but in case $\gamma$ is piecewise differentiable, it corresponds to the analytic definition by integration given in Ahlfors. Ahlfors calls a curve contained in an open region $\Omega$ homologous to zero if $n(\gamma,a)=0$ for all $a\in \Omega^c$. In homology theory, as I understand it, we would call a curve homologous to zero if it represents the zero element in $H_1(\Omega, \mathbb Z)$. That is, $\gamma$ is the boundary of some singular $2$-chain. My question: Why do all of these notions agree? Why is Ahlfors' definition of being homologous to zero (using Munkres' definition of winding number) agree with the usual homological one? I would like to use Munkres' definition because it works for continuous curves, not just piecewise differentiable ones, and it seems to me the equivalence should hold in this generality.

399026,Velleman's Proof Designer problem 44,"This is an exercise I didn't solve from the group of exercises present on Velleman's site that should be solved using Proof Designer (the little program that comes with the book). Theorem: If $\forall \mathcal{F} (\cup \mathcal{F} = A \rightarrow A \in \mathcal{F})$, then $\exists x (A=\{x\})$. Before addressing my line of reasoning and the tentative proof, just few words on this specific problem. I find it interesting because it shows me that I still have problems figuring (and writing) properly existence results. About this, I would say that no matter what book on proof writing you take, this point is usually quickly considered and the examples are trivial, so not particularly useful for real mathematics. Probably this is related to the fact that existence theorems are in general the ""hard ones"" to be proven and to be thaught (I guess that they are the most difficult to be grasp by students), but I really don't know and I would like to know the opinions of experts. Line of Reasoning: I think the idea is that $x=\emptyset$ and $A=\{\emptyset\})$. In this way, what we have to assume should stand. Indeed, the antecedent should ""bind"" the nature of the family of sets and the consequence would follow. Tentative Proof: Let x be the empty set $\emptyset$. Thus, $\forall \mathcal{F} (\cup \mathcal{F} = \{\emptyset\} \rightarrow \{\emptyset\} \in \mathcal{F})$. Take $\mathcal{F}=\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}$. Then, we have $\cup \{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\} = \{\emptyset\} \rightarrow \{\emptyset\} \in \{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}$, and the result is established. PS: As I pointed out in another post, in general I try to be more consistent grammatically speaking when I write down proofs, and I avoid the use of logical symbols. I tend to do it when I have doubts about the content of the problem and here... I have no clue at all, so forgive it. Any feedback is more than welcome.",['elementary-set-theory']

In the literature, I've encountered (more than) four different definitions.  Since I'm still a beginner, it's unclear to me whether these definitions are equivalent or not.  I would appreciate any clarification. All maps and group actions are assumed continuous. Definition 1: A principal $G$ -bundle is a fiber bundle $F \to P \xrightarrow{\pi} X$ together with a right action of $G$ on $P$ such that: (1) $G$ acts freely and transitively on fibers. (2A) $G$ preserves fibers. Definition 2: A principal $G$ -bundle is a fiber bundle $F \to P \xrightarrow{\pi} X$ together with a left action of $G$ on $F$ (note $F$ here) such that: (1) $G$ acts freely and transitively on $F$ . (2B) There exists a trivializing cover with $G$ -valued transition maps. Definition 3: A principal $G$ -bundle is a fiber bundle $F \to P \xrightarrow{\pi} X$ together with a right action of $G$ on $P$ such that: (1') $G$ acts freely on $P$ and $X = P/G$ and $\pi\colon P \to X$ is $p \mapsto [p]$ . (2C) There exists a trivializing cover that is $G$ -equivariant. Definition 4: A principal $G$ -bundle is a fiber bundle $F \to P \xrightarrow{\pi} X$ together with a right action of $G$ on $P$ such that: (2A) $G$ preserves fibers. (2C) There exists a trivializing cover that is $G$ -equivariant. Thoughts: It seems to me that Definition 4 is not equivalent to the other three.  More than anything else, I am unclear as to why the existence of a trivializing cover that is $G$ -equivariant is equivalent (is it?) to the existence of one that has $G$ -valued transition functions.

399138,Does it make sense to talk about the concatenation of infinite series?,"Does a series of numbers defined as the concatenation of two or more infinite series, for example all the positive integers followed by all the negative integers, make mathematical sense? I came up with this problem while writing an implementation of infinite series in Erlang. I'm not sure how to represent this in code in a way that isn't horrific, and wondered if it even made any sense. I'm a programmer, not a mathematician, so won't understand any answers too steeped in technical terms! EDIT: Ok, After reading and being confused by a few answers I have discovered that the mathematical definition of concatenation appears to be a bit different to my understanding of it from programming. When I say ""the concatenation of two infinite series"", what I actually mean is a new series that consists of all the elements of the first series followed by all the elements of the second series. So for the example I gave above, the positive integers followed by the negative integers, you could start at the beginning of the series and get only positive numbers, never in fact reaching the second infinite series. However, if you then applied some sort of 'filter' to this concatenated (in my definition) infinite series, that would somehow make the first part of it finite, then it would be possible to count up to elements of the second series. I hope this makes more sense now, and if there is a more appropriate mathematical term I can use instead of concatenation, please let me know. Ta!",['sequences-and-series']

399394,If $\left| f'(x) \right| \leq A |f(x)|^\beta $ then f is a constant function,"Problem Let $f(x)$ be a differentiable function on $[a,b]$ satisfying $f(a)=0$. If there exist $A \ge 0$ and $\beta \ge 1$ such that the inequality $$\left| f'(x) \right| \leq A \left| f(x) \right|^\beta $$ holds for all $x$ in $[a,b]$, then $f(x) = 0$ for any x in that interval. My attempted solution We shall prove by contradiction. Suppose that for some $x$ in $[a,b]$ we have $f(x) \neq 0$. Put $S:= \left\lbrace x \right. $ such that $a \le x \le b $ and $f(x) \neq 0 \left. \right\rbrace$ and $c:=\inf S$ (the infimum value of set $S$). If $c=b$ then $ f(x) = 0$   $\forall  x < b$ and the continuity of $f$ implies that $f(b) = 0$, too (contradiction). Therefore $c \neq b$. If $c=a$, then $f(c) = 0$ by the hypothesis. Otherwise, when $a < c < b$ we have $f(x) = 0$ $\forall x < c$ and again, by continuity, $f(c) = 0$. Thus in all cases considered, we have $f(c) = 0$ and $a \leq c < b$ As $f$ is continuous at $c$ and $f(c) = 0$, one can choose $d>c$ and close enough to $c$ such that $|f(x)| \le 1$ and $$\tag{$\star$} A(x-c) \le \frac12\quad\text{for all }x\text{ with }c \le x \le d.$$ Since $f$ is continuous on $[c,d]$, it has maximum and minimum values on this closed interval, leading to the existence of $c \le t \le d$ such that $|f(t)| = \max_{c \le x \le d} |f(x)|$. As already noted, $f(c) = 0$ and $c$ is the infimum of the set of numbers whose image under $f$ is nonzero. Therefore, for any $\epsilon>0$, there is some $c<m<c+\epsilon$ satisfying $f(m) \neq 0$. This observation, together with the definition of $t$, gives us $$\tag{$\star\!\star$}f(t) \neq 0,$$ $t \neq c$ and so $c<t$. Applying the Lagrange theorem gives: $$ |f(t)| = |f(t) - f(c)| = |t-c||f'(u)| \leq|t-c|A|f(u)|^\beta $$ where $c<u<t\le d$. By $(\star)$:
$$ |t-c|A|f(u)|^\beta \le \frac12 |f(u)|^\beta \leq \frac12 |f(u)| $$ Combining the two inequalities and noting that $|f(t)| \ge |f(u)|$ (because of the definition of $t$), we have $f(u) = f(t) = 0$ and arrived at a contradiction with $(\star\star)$.

A common application of inclusion/exclusion in undergraduate combinatorics and probability classes is to compute the number of derangements, and in the process show that the probability a random permutation is a derangement approaches $\frac{1}{e}$ for large $n$ . There's also a ""standard"" intuition for this probability, which goes roughly as follows:  Let $E_i$ be the event that $\sigma(i)=i$ . 1) For a given $i$ , the probability of $E_i$ is exactly $\frac{1}{n}$ . 2) If $n$ is large, than these events should be ""nearly"" independent ( $E_i$ occurring means that $\sigma(i) \neq j$ , making it a tiny bit more likely that $\sigma(j)=j$ , but this shouldn't have much of an effect for large $n$ ), so we'd expect the probability none of the $E_i$ occur to be roughly $\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n$ . 3) For large $n$ , $\left(1-\frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx \frac{1}{e}$ . Now the last approximation alone already has an error proportional to $\frac{1}{n}$ .  What's suprising then is that, after working through the inclusion/exclusion , you find that the probability is not just approximately $\frac{1}{e}$ , but incredibly close -- the error is less than $\frac{1}{(n+1)!}$ . Is there some alternative intuitive explanation for the $\frac{1}{e}$ asymptotic probability that gives a sense of why the convergence is so fast?","['derangements', 'inclusion-exclusion', 'intuition', 'combinatorics']"

The normal procedure is creating a matrix and filling it with elements of S and introducing a new surjective function $p$.The problem that I'm having is that I don't know in which way to change the diagonal elements so that $p$ should, but cannot be in the matrix. Can someone help me, or at least give me some tips?","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"
399507,How do I know when a form represents an integral cohomology class?,"Suppose $M$ is an $n$-dimensional manifold, and $\omega \in \Omega^p(M)$ is a closed $p$-form. Moreover, assume that $d\omega = 0$, so that it represents a de Rham cohomology class. I would like to understand the meaning of the following sentence that I read in a book about geometric quantisation: $\omega$ represents an integral cohomology class . Here's what I thought: we have the Poincaré isomorphism $\Phi : H_{dR}^p(M) \rightarrow {H_p}(M, \mathbb{R})^*$, where: $$H_{dR}^p(M) = \text{$p$th de Rham cohomology group;}$$
$${H_p}(M, \mathbb{R}) = \text{$p$th differentiable singular homology group;}$$ and the star denotes the dual. This isomorphism is given by integration of the given form over the corresponding $p$-cycle. Now, since we have a natural inclusion ${H_p}(M, \mathbb{Z}) \subseteq {H_p}(M, \mathbb{R})$, I could say that $\omega \in \Omega^p(M)$ represents an integral cohomology class when $\Phi(\omega) \in {H_p}(M, \mathbb{Z})$. But this is basically saying that the integral of $\omega$ over any differentiable $p$-cycle is an integer. Surely this cannot hold, except for trivial cases. So what does it mean to represent an integral cohomology class? I would also like to know: when does the volume form of a closed manifold represents an integral cohomology class, and why? Thank you.","['homology-cohomology', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

399543,Problems sampling from a $pdf$ over $SO\left(3\right)$,"I have a probability density function over $SO\left(3\right)$, which I am trying to sample from. The $pdf$ is given as a generalized fourier series: $$ f\left(\omega,\theta,\phi\right)=\sum s_{\lambda}^{n}Z_{\lambda}^{n}\left(\omega,\theta,\phi\right)$$ where $s_{\lambda}^{n}$ are the coefficients and $Z_{\lambda}^{n}\left(\omega,\theta,\phi\right)$ are basis functions (symmetrized hyperspherical harmonics), and $SO\left(3\right)$ is parameterized by the variables $\left(\omega,\theta,\phi\right)$, which are the rotation angle, and spherical coordinates of the rotation axis, respectively. I want to sample values of $\left(\omega,\theta,\phi\right)$ (i.e. rotations) from this distribution, but I'm having trouble doing so. So far I have essentially tried two methods: rejection sampling, a discrete method. Both methods have given me something that is qualitatively similar to what I would expect, but they seem to have an erroneous uniform distribution superimposed. So I have two questions: (1) Any ideas why I might be getting this uniform noise? (2) Any suggestions of how to fix it or a better way to sample from this kind of distribution? Further Details: To check my sampling method I used some software to generate a known distribution and sample rotations. I then computed $s_{\lambda}^{n}$ from these ""correct samples"". Then I tried to generate samples myself from the spectral form of $f\left(\omega,\theta,\phi\right)$ given above. Next I calculated $s_{\lambda}^{n}$ from my samples and compared the two. My samples led to the low order terms being generally too small in magnitude and the higher order terms being too large in magnitude. The discrete method that I used consisted of generating a ""grid"" of points over $SO\left(3\right)$, and using these as the centers of bins. The bins were sized proportional to the probability density at the bin center. Then uniform samples were generated and the number that fell in each bin was then proportional to the associated probability of the respective bins. Again, both methods produced a sort of background noise which looks like a uniform distribution on top of the correct distribution. As, a side note, it seems like I ought to be able to exploit the form of this expression for efficient sampling, but I haven't made use of the spectral decomposition at all in my attempts.","['sampling', 'probability-distributions', 'probability', 'rotations']"
