620164,Simplify $\sum_{n=0}^{N}\binom{N}{n} \frac{a^{N-n}}{n!} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} f(x)$,"Simplify the following expression
$$S_N = \sum_{n=0}^{N}\binom{N}{n} \frac{a^{N-n}}{n!} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} f(x), $$
where $a$ is a real number and $f(x)$ is an analytic real function.
What is $\lim_n S_n$? Is there a simple intuitive meaning to it? I only found formulas which come close but not quite what I need: Without the $n!$ in the denominator, the expression can be simpified using the Leibniz rule $$ \sum_{n=0}^{N}\binom{N}{n} a^{N-n} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} f(x) =e^{-ax}\frac{d^N}{dx^N}\left[ e^{ax} f(x)\right].$$
Without the binomial coefficient the Taylor series expansion of $f(x)$ around $x$ gives
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{a^{N-n}}{n!} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} f(x) =a^N f\left(x+a^{-1}\right).$$ EDIT :
With an extra set of parentheses
$$\left[\sum_{n=0}^N \binom{N}{n}a^{N-n}\right]\left[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!} \frac{d^n}{dx^n}f(x)  \right] = (1+a)^N f(x+1) $$
On the other hand
$$
\lim_{z\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{N!}\frac{d^N}{dz^N}\sum_n A_n z^n \sum_m B_m z^m = 
\lim_{z\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{N!}\frac{d^N}{dz^N} \sum_{N} \sum_{n} A_{N-n}B_n z^N  = \sum_n A_{N-n}B_n$$
so combining the above two 
$$\sum_n \binom{N}{n} \frac{a^{N-n}}{n!} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} f(x) = \lim_{z\rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{N!}\frac{d^N}{dz^N}\left[ (1+az)^N f(x+z)\right] $$

620271,finding $E[X]$ of a exponential distribution with a deductable,"Losses follow an exponential distribution with parameter $\theta$. For a deductible of 100, the expected payment per loss is 2000. What is the expected payment per loss for a deductible of 500? They get 
$2,000e^{\frac{-400}{\theta}}$ but I'm not sure how they got this. I know I need to solve for $\lambda$ so what I did was I transformed the parameter $\theta$ to fit the deductible by subtracting 100. Therefore $Y=\theta-100$.

620290,"Is it possible for a function to be smooth everywhere, analytic nowhere, yet Taylor series at any point converges in a nonzero radius?","It is well-known that the function $$f(x) = \begin{cases} e^{-1/x^2}, \mbox{if } x \ne 0 \\ 0, \mbox{if } x = 0\end{cases}$$ is smooth everywhere, yet not analytic at $x = 0$. In particular, its Taylor series exists there, but it equals $0 + 0x + 0x^2 + 0x^3 + ... = 0$, so while it has radius of convergence $\infty$, it is not equal to $f$ even in a tiny neighborhood of $0$. There is also a function $$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} e^{-\sqrt{2^n}} \cos(2^n x)$$ which is smooth everywhere (that is, $C^{\infty}$) yet analytic nowhere . In particular, the Taylor series at every point has radius of convergence $0$. In fact, ""most"" smooth functions are not analytic. But this gets me wondering. Could there exist some function which is smooth everywhere, analytic nowhere, yet its Taylor series at any point has nonzero radius of convergence, and so converges to something , but that something is not the function, not even in a tiny neighborhood about the point of expansion? If yes, what is an example of such a function? If no, what is the proof that such a thing is impossible? And also, if no, what sort of restrictions exist on the convergence of the T.s.? At how many/what distribution of points can it converge to something which is not the function? I note that if we multiply together the two functions just given above, we have another smooth-everywhere, analytic-nowhere function, but this time at $0$ we have a convergent Taylor series (the same zero series as before -- just use the generalized Leibniz rule) which doesn't converge to the function in even a tiny neighborhood of $0$. EDIT (Dec 31, 2013): With some Googling I came across a post to mathoverflow: https://mathoverflow.net/a/81465 The Taylor series of the Fabius function at any dyadic rational actually has infinite radius of convergence (only finitely many terms are nonzero) but does not represent the function on any interval. So it seems it is possible to have a function whose Taylor series converges to ""the wrong thing"" at a dense set of expansion points. But it still doesn't answer the question of whether that is possible for all expansion points on the entire real line.","['power-series', 'calculus', 'analyticity', 'real-analysis']"

620396,Coefficients in expansion of $(\sqrt[3]{2} - 1)^m$,"In trying to solve $a^3 - 2b^3 = 1$ over the integers I came across the need to answer the question: when does $(1+ \sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{2}^2)^n$ have no $\sqrt[3]{2}^2$ term in it's expansion (in terms of the basis $\{1,\sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[3]{2}^2\}$ of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt[3]{2}]$). Clearly this cannot happen for positive $n$ (create a set of recursions that generate the next coeffs from the previous ones and you can observe all three coeffs are always positive). Of course for $n=0$ it does happen and you get the trivial solution $(a,b)=(1,0)$. I am struggling to sort out the negative $n$ case. This is the same as studying positive integer powers of $(\sqrt[3]{2} - 1)$. I guess that for positive $m$ you only ever get a zero coefficient of $\sqrt[3]{2}^2$ in $(\sqrt[3]{2} - 1)^m$ whenever $m=1$ (giving another solution $(a,b)=(-1,-1)$).

Specifically, I would like you to check that surjectivity is needed for proving the first part and injectivity is needed for proving the second part. Problem If $\phi: G \to H$ is an isomorphism, prove that $G$ is abelian if and only if $H$ is abelian. Solution Let $\phi: G \to H$ be an isomorphism. If $G$ is abelian, we have $xy = yx$, for any $x,y \in G$. Consider any two element in $H$, say $c$ and $d$. Since $\phi$ is an isomorphism (more specifically a surjection), we have $c = \phi(a)$ and $d=\phi(b)$ for some $a,b \in G$. Hence, $$cd = \phi(a)\phi(b) = \phi(ab) = \phi(ba) = \phi(b)\phi(a) = dc$$
This means $H$ is also abelian. If $H$ is abelian, we have $xy = yx$, for any $x,y \in H$. Now consider two elements in $G$, say $a$ and $b$. Since $\phi$ is a mapping, we have $c=\phi(a)$ and $d=\phi(b)$ for some $c,d \in H$. Hence,
$$\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b) = cd = dc = \phi(b) \phi(a) = \phi(ba)$$

My answer is: I first calculated the gradient of f and then let partial derivative of x and y to be equal to 0.Thereby the critical points I found are (0,0)(0,3)(0,-3)(6,0)(6,3)(6,-3). Then I computed the Hessian matrix : H(x,y)=

 To find the nature of critical points I computed the Hassian matrix at each critical point. These are my answers for part 2: H(0,0) This can be either positive semi definite or negative semi definite.Hence the critical point can either be a minimizer , maximizer or a saddle point.Therefore it can't be concluded the type of the critical point. H(0,3) This is positive semi definite. Therefore as earlier nothing can be said about the critical point. Same with H(0,-3). H(6,0)is also positive semi definite. H(6,3) is a positive definite matrix.Hence there's a local minimum at (6,3) H(6,-3) is a positive definite matrix.Hence there's a local minimum at (6,-3). Answers for part 3: I used the theory H(z) is negative semidefinite for all z ∈ S ⇒ [x is a global maximizer of  f  in S if and only if x is a stationary point of  f ]
H(z) is positive semidefinite for all z ∈ S ⇒ [x is a global minimizer of  f  in S if and only if x is a stationary point of  f ], When H(x,y) is positive semidefinite for all x in a particular region, in that region the function is convex and any local minimizer is a global minimizer in that region.
Is this a correct statement? To be positive semi definite det H(1)>0 and det H(2)=0: Thus 12x$^2$ - 48x > 0. x$\in $ (-infinity,0)$\cup$(4,infinity) det H(2)=0 when (12x$^2$-48x)(12y$^2$-36)=0 Since (12x$^2$-48x) >0, (12y$^2$-36)=0 Thus y=$\pm$$\sqrt3$ Thus hessian matrix is positive definite when x$\in $ (-infinity,0)$\cup$(4,infinity) and y=$\pm$$\sqrt3$  . But can I say that the matrix is positive definite even if det H(2)>0. Therefore I selected the critical points where x$\in $ (-infinity,0)$\cup$(4,infinity) and y>$\sqrt3$  and y<-$\sqrt3$. Thus the global minimizers of f are (6,3)are (6,-3). This is a very long process and I do not understand how to find the answer for part 4.

Has it got to do with the fact that $\mathbb{Q}$ is a field? Problem Prove that the additive groups $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are not isomorphic. Solution Let there exist an isomorphism between $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$. Now consider the element $1_{\mathbb{Q}}$. We then have $\phi(1_{\mathbb{Q}}) = z \in \mathbb{Z}$. Since $\phi$ has to be a bijection, $z$ cannot be zero, since $\phi(0) = 0$. Now consider the element $\left(\dfrac1{z+1}\right)_{\mathbb{Q}}$. We now have $$z = \phi(1_{\mathbb{Q}}) = \phi\left(\underbrace{\left(\dfrac1{z+1}\right)_{\mathbb{Q}} + \left(\dfrac1{z+1}\right)_{\mathbb{Q}} + \cdots + \left(\dfrac1{z+1}\right)_{\mathbb{Q}}}_{z+1 \text{ times }} \right) = (z+1) \phi\left(\left(\dfrac1{z+1}\right)_{\mathbb{Q}}\right)$$
However, there is no element in $y \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(z+1)y = z$. First update Actually I realize that I complicated it unnecessarily. Instead, we can do like this. Since $\phi$ is an isomorphism, we have $\phi(q_{\mathbb{Q}}) = 1_{\mathbb{Z}}$ for some $q \in Q$. However, $$\phi(q) = \phi(q/2+q/2) = 2\phi(q/2)$$ And there is no $y \in Z$, such that $2y=1$.

620598,Qualitative dependence of solution to second-order matrix differential equation on eigenvalues,"Suppose we have a matrix differential equation in $\vec{x}(t)=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}x_{1}(t) \\ \vdots \\ x_{n}(t)\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ , such that: $$\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\vec{x}}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}=-\mathbf{M}\vec{x}$$ And $\mathbf{M}$ is a real, symmetric matrix, which therefore diagonalizes to $\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{P}\mathbf{\Lambda}\mathbf{P}^{-1}$ , with $\mathbf{\Lambda}=\operatorname{diag}(\lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{n})$ . We can perform a change of basis such that $\vec{x}(t)=\mathbf{P}\vec{\eta}(t)$ , and therefore we have the following: $$\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\vec{\eta}}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}=-\mathbf{\Lambda}\vec{\eta} \implies \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\eta_{i}}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}=-\lambda_{i}\eta_{i}$$ This is easy to solve and gives us: $$\eta_{i}=\begin{cases}A_{i}\cos(\sqrt{\lambda_{i}}t)+B_{i}\sin(\sqrt{\lambda_{i}}t) & \lambda_{i} > 0 \\
A_{i}+B_{i}t & \lambda_{i} = 0 \\
A_{i}e^{\sqrt{-\lambda_{i}}t}+B_{i}e^{-\sqrt{-\lambda_{i}}t} & \lambda_{i} < 0\end{cases}$$ We can therefore solve for $\vec{x}$ by computing $\mathbf{P}\vec{\eta}$ . However, I am then asked how the qualitative behaviour of $\vec{x}$ depends upon the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{M}$ . I am having trouble understanding what is required of me; we have the qualitative behaviour of $\eta_{i}$ and it's dependence upon $\lambda_{i}$ , but without more explicit knowledge of the change of basis matrix $\mathbf{P}$ I'm not sure what we can say about $\vec{x}$ ? The question then requires us to focus on the $2$ -dimensional coupled system of differential equations: \begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}x_{1}}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}&=-kx_{1}-lx_{2} \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}x_{2}}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}&= -lx_{1} - kx_{2}
\end{align} We can therefore construct $\mathbf{M}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}k & l \\ l & k\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ , which diagonalizes to give $\mathbf{\Lambda}=\operatorname{diag}(k-l,k+l)$ and $\mathbf{P}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{smallmatrix}-1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ . Now clearly the solution can be worked out explicitly using the method above and then the qualitative behaviour can be explored, but is there anything we can say without explicit calculation?","['systems-of-equations', 'linear-algebra', 'calculus', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

Consider a Hilbert space with a basis $\{v_{i}\}$ where $i\in I$ an index set, which could be uncountably infinite. We define a ""Gram-Schmidt for infinite dimension"" to consist of a total ordering $\leq$ on the index set $I$ and a set of orthonormal basis $\{b_{i}\}$ where $i\in I$, and the following condition is satisfied: for any $i\in I$, then $b_{i}$ can be written as a finite linear combination of $v_{i}$ and $b_{j}$ where $j<i$. We define a ""Gram-Schmidt for infinite dimension with series allowed"" to be just like above, except that $b_{i}$ is allowed to be written as series instead of just finite linear combination. So the question is, can ""Gram-Schmidt for infinite dimension"" be done in a general Hilbert space starting with an arbitrary basis $\{v_{i}\}$? What about ""Gram-Schmidt for infinite dimension with series allowed""? Clearly, if $I$ is countable, the answer is trivial. The interesting case is when $I$ is uncountable.

620697,Dividing a deck of cards using only imagination,"The idea came up from a discussion I had with my friends. Suppose we want to play a game using a deck of cards, and we can't use any physical materials. If we are intelligent enough, we can remember the types of cards each one has. The problem is that it is even hard to divide the cards uniformly by using only our brains. To divide them properly, each one should not know the types of cards others have. By introducing a 'dealer', it becomes easy. We can ask the dealer to tell each person what cards they will have. But the dealer then can't participate in the game. The question is that how can players divide the deck uniformly by themselves. I think it is important to specify the exact condition for the problem. This is what I have in mind. Each person can uniformly choose a number from a finite set of numbers All players trust each other. That is, if they agreed on a particular procedure on dividing cards, they will actually follow the procedure. The procedure would consist of a sequence of data transfer from one person to other. The receiver will remember the data exactly, and it is impossible to forget it. By the end of the procedure, the conditional probability distribution of cards given all the information each person knows should be uniform. This is far from clear mathematical formulation. So the first question is: How can we formulate this problem exactly into mathematical language? For example, how can we define the concept of data transfer? The question is easy when there are only two people and two cards. One can just simply grab one and pass the other. But the question seems much harder for even three people and three cards. How can three individuals divide three cards uniformly? Or if it is impossible, are there any proof? I think this can be a more fundamental question. Can two people having their own number from 1, 2 or 3, interact with each other to conclude that whether they have same or different numbers, but gain no more information about their opponent's number?

The matching algorithms already works but i'm having trouble with the logical and mathematical aspects of functions and it's properties, wich will define in great ways the design of the language. I have several questions about function properties: Associative and commutative properties apply only on binary functions? For example, if I declare a function max(a,b), this will be commutative because max(a,b) = max(b,a) and associative because max(a,max(b,c)) = max(max(a,b), c), but I can't think of any function with more than two arguments that satisfy this axioms. For example I can define max(a,b,c) = max(a,max(b,c)) which will be a ternary function but the language will be able to unify it with the binary operations that conforms it. The unification works by reducing associative functions such as max(a,max(b,c)) onto a varydic and canonical form max(a,b,c) and then performing the pattern matching onto this canonical forms, so all (I think) possible functions that have this properties with more than 2 arguments are in fact composites of the same binary function Do identity elements apply only on binary functions?

(more than 2 arguments) such that exist an element e that satisfies f(a,b,c,e) = f(a,b,c) for functions that doesn't have an immediate binary parent (such as addition is binary but the compiler manages addition as a varydic function for internal representantion) Unitiy elements such as zero in addition are managed in the language only by removing its aparences on functions for example add(1,2,x,0) wich represents the expression 1+2+x+0 reduces to 1+2+x This questions are decisive for the design of algorithms that automatically identify this properties on functions when rules are defined such as a+b = b+a and for the language design and the constraints that will impose to the declaration of functions, which can be, if false for any of this questions, illogical","['functions', 'lambda-calculus', 'abstract-algebra', 'unification']"

620872,Plausibility argument for Zorn's Lemma,"In ""Mathematical Physics"" by Robert Geroch, the following 'plausibility argument' is given for Zorn's Lemma [If every totally ordered subset of a partially ordered set $S$ is bounded above, $S$ has a maximal element]: It is not difficult to convince onselef that this statement [Zorn's Lemma] seems ""true"". Pick $s_1$ in $S$. If this $s_1$ is not a maximal element, there is an $s_2$, different from $s_1$, with $s_1 \leq s_2$. If $s_2$ is not maximal, there is an $s_3$, different from $s_2$, with $s_2 \leq  s_3$, etc. Either we eventually obtain a maximal element (in which case we are done), or we obtain $s_1 \leq s_3 \leq s_3 \leq ... $ . In this latter case, $\{s_1,s_2,...\}$ is a totally ordered subset of $S$, whence it is bounded above, say by $s_1'$. If $s_1'$ is not a maximal element, there is $s_2'$ with $s_1' \leq s_2'$, etc. (We ""go right through infinity."") If we find no maximal element in $s_1', s_2', ...$, we obtain, again, a totally ordered set, which must be bounded above, say by $s_1''$, etc. Suppose we are unlucky and go through an infinite sequence of such sequences without finding a maximal element. Then we obtain totally ordered $s_{m}^{n} \{m,n = 1,2,...\}$, which must be bounded above, say by $t1$, etc. We ""continue in this way. At every stage we have a totally ordered subset, which must be bounded above, so we add in this upper bound to obtain a new totally ordered subset. We can go through infinity, an infinity of infinities, etc. We never get stuck; we can always go on. We should obtain eventually a maximal element."" I don't see how this argument makes Zorn's Lemma plausible, however. If anything, it seems to say that it is possible that we can go through infinities of elements forever, always finding upper bounds and forming totally ordered sets with them, and doing this on and on, without ever finding a maximal element. In particularly, how does the last sentence above ""We should obtain eventually a maximal element"" at all follow from the argument?","['logic', 'elementary-set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"

620881,Behavior of holomorphic functions on the boundary of the unit disk,"$\textbf{Problem.}$ Suppose $f$ is holomorphic on the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. Show there are points $a_n\in \mathbb{D}$, $a\in \partial \mathbb{D}$, and $b\in \mathbb{C}$ such that $a_n\to a$ and $f(a_n)\to b$, as $n\to \infty.$ $\textbf{Attempt at a Solution:}$
First, if $f$ has an essential singularity at some point $a\in \partial\mathbb{D}$, I think the statement follows easily. To contradiction suppose that the statement is false. That is, suppose that $f(a_n)\to \infty$ for all sequences $\{a_n\}$ in $\mathbb{D}$ where $a_n\to a$, $a\in \partial\mathbb{D}.$ Then $$\frac{1}{f(z)}\to 0, \hspace{1cm} \mbox{as} \hspace{1cm}|z|\to 1.$$ $\textbf{ Case 1}$: If $f$ is nowhere vanishing on $\mathbb{D}$, then $1/f(z)$ would be holomorphic in $\mathbb{D}$ and can be extended continuously on $\bar{\mathbb{D}}$. Then, by the maximum principle this would imply that $1/f(z)\equiv 0$ on all of $\mathbb{D}$. But this contradicts the fact that $f$ is holomorphic (non-constant) in $\mathbb{D}.$ $\textbf{Case 2}$: Suppose $f$ has a finite number of zeros in $\mathbb{D}$. That is, let $\{b_1,...,b_n\}$ be points of $\mathbb{D}$ such that $f(b_i)=0.$ Let $r=\min \{|z-b_i| \forall z\in \partial\mathbb{D}\}$, and consider the annulus $$A=\{z\in\mathbb{C}: r<r_1<|z|<1\}$$ Then, $1/f(z)$ is holomorphic on $A$, and can be continuously extended to $\bar A$. (Note that, $1/f(z)$ is already holomorphic for $|z|=r_1$. Let $$g(z)=\frac{1}{f(z)}\frac{1}{f(r_1/z)}.$$ Then $g(z)=0$ for all $z\in \partial \bar{A}$. By the maximum principle it follows that $g(z)\equiv 0$ on $A$, and by the identity theorem it follows that $1/f(z)\equiv 0$ on $A$. But this, again, contradicts the fact that $f$ is holomorphic on $\mathbb{D}$ and thus on $A$ as well. $\textbf{Case 3:}$ This is the case where i'm not so sure what i'm doing is correct. Suppose, now, that $f$ has an infinite number of zeros in $\mathbb{D}$. That is, let $E=\{b_i\in \mathbb{D}: g(b_i)=0\}$. Then, $E$ cannot have an accumulation point in $\mathbb{D}.$ My idea was to take neighborhoods, $\mathbb{B}_{r_i}(b_i)$, and consider $$g(z)=\frac{1}{f(z)}\prod_{w\in A_w}\frac{1}{f(z/w)},$$ where $A_w=\{w\in \mathbb{D}: |w-b_i|=r_i\},$ for all $z\in \overline{\mathbb{D}\setminus\bigcup \mathbb{B}_{r_i}(b_i)}.$ Then, I would argue similarly as in Case 2.

On the other hand, we can choose an arbitrary sequence $S=(a_n)_n$ of rational numbers converging to $\alpha$, pick up $a_n=p_n/q_n\in S$ and calculate possible values of $e^{2i\pi p_n/q_n}$. The $q_n$ part will open many branches, but eventually $p_n$ will make some of them become equal. It is not clear whether the number of solutions is growing. Because multivaluedness can cause serious headaches sometimes, let's define some things. Cosine and sine are defined by the usual taylor series and exponentiation by a natural number remains untouched. Roots are calculated by this procedure: $\mathbf{1^{1/q_n}}$ is defined to be the set $$\mathbf{1^{1/q_n}}=\{z:z\in\mathbb{C}\wedge z^{q_n}=1\}.$$ We, then, define $\mathbf{1^{p_n/q_n}}$ to be the set $K_n=\{z^{p_n}:z\in\mathbb{C}\wedge z^{q_n}=1\}$.

The cases $||f||_p=0$ or $||g||_p=0$ are trivial. So we assume $||f||_p=\alpha\neq0$ and $||g||_p=\beta\neq0$ , then there are functions $f_0,g_0\in L^p$ such that $|f|=\alpha f_0,|g|=\beta g_0$ , and $||f_0||_p=||g_0||_p=1$ . Defining $\lambda=\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}$ , \begin{eqnarray}

I was able to do it in terms of $\sin x$ alone. $\tan2x = \sin2x/\cos2x$ Since, $\cos2x = 1-2\sin^2x$ Therefore, $\tan2x = (\sin2x / 1-2\sin^2x)$ Is it possible to do it in terms of $\cos x$ alone ?",['trigonometry']

(9 answers) Constructing a bijection (2 answers) Closed 10 years ago . I need help with finding a bijection between these two intervals: [a,b) and [a,b]. It is told that a,b are in R (real numbers). I know how to construct a bijection if a,b are integers, but i have no idea how to do it if they are real. Any ideas? Edit: If anyone is still watching, can you tell me if I'm doing this right? So the bijection will be f(x) = 1) a if x = a and 2) b/p-1 if x != a and x = b/p , where p is in R - {0}. By taking the p from R - {0} and not from N, I think this could work for real numbers. Because a < b, every number from a to b can be written as b/p. So the function moves every number upwards if I express myself that way, thus reaching the b.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

Prove that the set of rational numbers satisfies the Archimedian property but not the least-upper-bound property . This shows that the Archimedian property does not imply the least-upper-bound axiom. I don't get what I have to do, and what it means -- to satisfy the least-upper-bound-property. I know it is an axiom, I didn't know it is a property . My closest guess is that if I have two rational numbers $x < y$, I can find an integer $n$ such that $nx > y$. And I don't need to refer to that axiom, because I can find this $n$ by playing with the integers inside the rational numbers. Previously from the book: The Archimedian property (page 26): If $x > 0$ and if $y$ is an arbitrary real number there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $nx > y$.

621422,"Two definitions of $H^1(\partial\Omega)$, one using charts and one use tangential gradients","Let $\Omega$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain with boundary $\partial\Omega$. There are two ways to define a space $H^1(\partial\Omega)$: By using charts, we can define $H^1(\partial\Omega)$ to contain functions $u\colon \partial\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $u\circ g_i \in H^1(D_i)$ for all $i$ where $g_i\colon D_i \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a chart map. The norm is the obvious norm. We can define a tangential gradient on $\partial\Omega$ as:
$$\nabla_S \varphi = \nabla \varphi - (\nabla \varphi \cdot \nu)\nu$$
where $\nu$ is the unit normal vector on $\partial\Omega$ and $\nabla$ is the usual gradient. Here $\varphi$ is smooth. We can get a weak version of the tangential gradient by using the integration by parts formula on surface, let's call the weak tangential gradient $\nabla_T.$ Then we can define $H^1(\partial\Omega)$ as functions $u:\partial\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $u \in L^2(\partial\Omega)$ and $\nabla_T u \in L^2(\partial\Omega)$, and give it the obvious norm. My question: are these definitions equivalent in some way? Do we have equivalence of norms? The second definition is not very common or popular, why is that?","['sobolev-spaces', 'partial-differential-equations', 'functional-analysis', 'differential-geometry']"

621453,The set of all binary sequences $(a_n)$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{a_n}}{n}$ converges/diverges.,"I am interested in knowing whether both the sets described above are uncountable. I think I managed to show that the set of binary sequences such that the series converges is uncountable. The main idea was to pick an arbitrary real $x$. Then given that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$ diverges, we can always construct $a_n$ such that the partial sums get arbitrarily close to $x$ and hence converge to $x$. Thus there is a surjection from all such sequences to the reals, so the set is uncountable. I have had no luck with the set of sequences such that the series doesn't converge though. I tried the diagonal argument, but I cannot see a reason why the 'new sequence' would necessarily yield a divergent series. Any ideas?","['sequences-and-series', 'elementary-set-theory']"
621464,$x$ and $y$ be distinct elements of order $2$ in $G$ that generate $G$. Prove that $G \cong D_{2n}$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Prove that a group generated by two elements of order $2$, $x$ and $y$, is isomorphic to $D_{2n}$, where $n = |xy|.$ (4 answers) Closed 10 years ago . Problem Let $G$ be a finite group and let $x$ and $y$ be distinct elements of order $2$ in $G$ that generate $G$. Prove that $G \cong D_{2n}$, where $\vert xy \vert = n$. Solution We have $x^2 = 1$ and $y^2=1$. If we let $t=xy$, we then have $tx = xt^{-1}$. This is because, $tx = xyx$ and $xt^{-1} = x(xy)^{-1} = xyx$, since $x^{-1} = x$ and $y^{-1} = y$. And note that $y = xt$. Hence, instead of $x$ and $y$ generating the group, we can have $x$ and $t$ to generate the group. I proved that setting $t=xy$, we have $tx=xt^{−1}$. And since $x$ and $y$ generate G, since $y=xt$, $t$ and $x$ also generates $G$. Is this (along with the fact that $G$ is finite) sufficient to conclude that $G \cong D_{2n}$? Also, I have another related question, can there be an infinite Dihedral group, i.e., $$D_{\infty} = \langle x,y \vert x^2=1, yx=xy^{-1}, y \text{ has infinite order}\rangle$$ Or is this isomorphic to some other group?","['proof-verification', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
621482,Rudin 13.3 zero operator as adjoint,"For an assignment I have to show that exists a densely defined operator on
a infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space, such that its adjoint is the zero operator
on the zero subspace. To show this there is a reference to exercise 13.3 in the book Functional Analysis of Rudin.
The exercise is as follows By theorem 13.8, $\mathscr{D}(T^*) =\{0\}$ for a densely defined operator $T$ in $H$ if and only if $\mathscr{G}(T)$ is dense in $H\times H$. Show that this can actually happen. Suggestion: Let $\{e_n:n=1,2,3, \dots\}$ be an orthonormal basis of $H$; let $\{x_n\}$ be a dense subset of $H$; define $Te_n=x_n$; and extend $T$ linearly to $\mathscr{D}(T)$, the set of all finite linear combinations of the basis vector $e_n$. Show that the graph of
  this $T$ is dense in $H \times H$. The exercise has been proved here . So now we know that $\mathscr{G}(T)$ 
is dense in $H \times H$. Then $V\,\mathscr{G}(T)$ is also dense, where $V$ is given by
$V\{a,b\}=\{-b,a\}$. According to theorem 13.8 we have $
\mathscr{G}(T^*) = [V\,\mathscr{G}(T)]^{\perp}.
$ Since $V\,\mathscr{G}(T)$ is dense we have that $\mathscr{G}(T^*)$ must be the zero
vector. Since $
\mathscr{G}(T^*) = \{\,\{x,T^*x\} : x \in \mathscr{D}(T^*)\},
$ we can conclude that $\mathscr{D}(T^*) = 0$ and $T^*x=0$, so that $T^*$ is the zero operator. I thought that I'm done here, however the original assignment has the remark: Once you have the correct idea and also realize that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(x,e_n)=0$ for all $x\in H$, the solution is almost immediate. If $y \in \mathscr{D}(T^*)$ then there exists a $T^*y \in H$ s.t. $
(Tx,y) = (x,T^*y) \qquad [x \in \mathscr{D}(T)]
$ and $x \rightarrow (Tx,y)$ must be continuous in $x$.
Letting $x=e_n$ we get $
(x_n,y) = (e_n,T^*y)
$ then using the remark above we see that $(x_n,y) \rightarrow 0$. Using
the continuity condition it follows that $\mathscr{D}(T^*)=\{0\}$. If this is correct it is just another way of proving the assignment.

621494,Trying to solve $tuu'= -1-u^2.$,"I am looking for the solution the the ODE $$tuu'= -1-u^2.$$ This problem came up in a book on differential equations that I am working through out of personal interest, so it's not  homework or anything. I tried the following approach. First I want to look for a solution to $tuu'= -u^2$ giving $$\frac{u'}{u}dt =- \frac{dt}{t}$$ This gives $\ln u = -\ln t = \ln \frac{1}{t}$ so that $u = \frac{C}{t}$ . The second part $tuu'= -1$ gives $$uu'dt =- \frac{dt}{t}$$ which has as its solution $u = \sqrt{\ln\left(1 \over t^{2}\right) +D}$ . Now the total solution to the original DE is $$u = \frac{C}{t} + \sqrt{\ln\left(1 \over t^{2}\right) + D}$$ The initial value given for this problem is $u(0) = 2$ . Now I dont see how I can even fill in $u(0)$ because we would be dividing by $0$ . I am sure I messed up the integration somewhere. I also noted that another solution to the DE is given by $u=0$ or $u=i$ ,  though both these dont satisfy the initial value either. However, this leads me to believe that my method of solving is not right and that I missed possible solutions. As is stands now I would be forced to conclude ta $C=0$ but then I still haven't solved it. Here is the original question: Problems 1–10 are the same initial-value problems as in the previous exercise set. This time use Heun's method with $h=0.1$ . Compare the approximate solutions obtained by Heun's method with the approximate solutions obtained with Euler's method. In Problems 1–6 compare the Heun approximation with the exact solutions. $tuu'=-1-u^2,\quad u(0)=2$","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus']"
