3913514,Showing that the free group of a disjoint union is isomorphic to the free product of the corresponding free groups,"P. Aluffi's ""Algebra: Chapter $\it 0$ "" , exercise II. $5.8$ . Still more generally, prove that $F(A\amalg B)=F(A)*F(B)$ and that $F^{ab}(A\amalg B)=F^{ab}(A)\oplus F^{ab}(B)$ for all sets $A,B$ . $($ That is, the constructions $F,F^{ab}$ 'preserve coproducts'. $)$ Here $F(A)$ is the free groups on the set $A$ , $A\amalg B$ is the disjoint union of $A$ and $B$ , and $G*H$ is the free product of $G$ and $H$ (i.e. the coproduct in $\sf Grp$ ). All of those are characterized by their usual universal properties which will be used extensively for the proof. $^*$ Proof. We will show that $F(A\amalg B)$ satisfies the universal property of $F(A)*F(B)$ . For startes, we will construct the (canonical) inclusion homomorphisms. Thus, consider the following diagrams Here $\iota_A,\iota_B,\iota$ are the inclusion of $A,B,A\amalg B$ into their respective free groups. The (unique) group homomorphisms $I_A,I_B$ are induced by considering the compositions $\iota\circ i_B$ and $\iota\circ i_B$ and the universal properties of $F(A)$ and $F(B)$ . Hence they are such that $$I_A\circ\iota_A=\iota\circ i_A,~~~I_B\circ\iota_B=\iota\circ i_B$$ Now, suppose we are given group homomorphisms $g_A\colon F(A)\to G,\,g_B\colon F(B)\to G$ to some arbitrary group $G$ . We can consider them in particular as set-functions and precomposing with $\iota_A$ and $\iota_B$ , respectively, gives us the following The unique map $g$ is given by the universal property of $A\amalg B$ and such that $$g\circ i_A=g_A\circ\iota_A,~~~g\circ i_B=g_B\circ\iota_B$$ Finally, $\overline{g}$ induces a unique map $\overline{f}$ such that by the universal property of $F(A\amalg B)$ and so $\overline{g}\circ\iota=g$ . Composing gives us uniquely determined group homomorphisms $\overline{g}\circ I_A\colon F(A)\to G$ and $\overline{g}\circ I_B\colon F(B)\to G$ factoring through $F(A\amalg B)$ . It remains to show the following $$\overline{g}\circ I_A=g_A,~~~\overline{g}\circ I_B=g_B$$ But using the given commutativity relations we see that $$(\overline{g}\circ I_A)\circ\iota_A=\overline{g}\circ(I_A\circ\iota_A)=\overline{g}\circ(\iota\circ i_A)=(\overline{g}\circ\iota)\circ i_A=g\circ i_A=g_A\circ\iota_A$$ and hence both triangles in the following diagram commute The right triangle corresponds to the fact the by $g_A\circ\iota_A$ universally induced map is $g_A$ itself. But from the left triangles we see that $\overline{f}\circ I_A$ makes the corresponding diagram commute as well and hence $\overline{f}\circ I_A=g_A$ by the uniquesness of the induced map. The same argument, with all $A$ s replaced by $B$ s, yields $\overline{f}\circ I_B=g_B$ . Thus, we conclude that $F(A\amalg B)$ satisfies the universal property of $F(A)*F(B)$ as every pair of group homomorphisms $g_A\colon F(A)\to G,\,g_B\colon F(B)\to G$ factors uniquely through $F(A\amalg B)$ using $I_A,I_B$ and $\overline{g}$ . Hence, $F(A\amalg B)\cong F(A)*F(B)$ . The argument is precisely the same for $F^{ab}$ where we note that $G*H=G\oplus H=G\times H$ for abelian groups. $\square$ Is the given proof correct; if so, can it be (substantially) improved? If not, where did I went wrong? I am not sure how to show actual equality instead 'mere' isomorphy (which is enough for me, to be honest) and the last part, i.e. showing that $\overline{g}\circ I_A=g_A$ , is a little bit sketchy to me, even though I am quite sure the argument works. Thanks in advance! $^*$ I know that this preservation essentially boils down to 'left adjoints presever colimits' as the (binary) coproduct is a simple colimit and the free functor $F\colon\sf{Set}\to\sf{Grp}$ is left adjoint to the forgetful functor $\sf{Grp}\to\sf{Set}$ . However, I would like to not dabble to deep into category theoretic terrain if it does not make the proof easier/more understandable. So the given proof is more or less from scratch.","['abstract-algebra', 'free-groups', 'solution-verification', 'free-product', 'group-theory']"
3913538,Is there anything interesting about the limit $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\Big|\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{|h|}\Big|$?,"I was wondering if there is anything interesting to say about the following limit: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ , and $a\in \mathbb{R}^n$ . Consider $$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\Big|\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{|h|}\Big|$$ If $f$ is differentiable I don't think the limit needs to converge. Suppose $f$ is differentiable at $a$ , then $$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\Big|\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{|h|}\Big|=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\Big|\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)-T(h)}{|h|}-\frac{|h|T(u)}{|h|}\Big|=\Big|T(u)\Big|$$ where $u$ is the unit vector in the direction of $h$ .

3913569,$f\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous if and only if for every open set $A$ in $\mathbb{R}$ we have $f^{-1}(A)$ open in $\mathbb{R}$,"I would like some feedback and corrections to my proof below that $f\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous if and only if for every open set $A$ in $\mathbb{R}$ we have $f^{-1}(A)$ open in $\mathbb{R}$ , using $\varepsilon\text{-}\delta$ definition of continuity. ( $\Rightarrow$ ). If $f$ is continuous, then for all $a\in\mathbb{R}$ we have that for all $\varepsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x\in X$ with $\left|x-a\right|<\delta$ this is going to imply that $\left|f(x)-f(a)\right|<\varepsilon$ . Take an open set $A\subset f[\mathbb{R}]\subset \mathbb{R}$ ( I'm not sure if it's necessary to take it as subset of $f[\mathbb{R}]$ ). For any $f(a)\in A$ , because $f$ is continuous, we can choose any $\varepsilon>0$ , so we do it by choosing $\varepsilon_{f(a)}>0$ such that $(f(a)-\varepsilon,f(a)+\varepsilon)\subset A$ , and this is possible because $A$ is open by hypothesis. As $f$ is continuous, this $\varepsilon_{f(a)}>0$ will gives us a $\delta_{a}>0$ such that all $x\in \mathbb{R}$ that are within a distance $\delta_a$ from $a$ will have their image $f(x)$ within a distance $\varepsilon_{f(a)}$ from $f(a)$ . That is, we are going to have an open interval $(a-\delta_a,a+\delta_a)$ , and because all of the $x\in\mathbb{R}$ inside of this interval have their image $f(x)\in A$ , this interval $(a-\delta_a,a+\delta_a)$ is a subset of $f^{-1}(A)$ . If we follow this for all $f(a)\in A$ , we are going to end up with an open interval with center $a$ and radius $\delta_a$ for each $a\in f^{-1}(A)$ , so $f^{-1}(A)$ is open. ( $\Leftarrow$ ). We have that for every open set $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ we have $f^{-1}(A)$ open in $\mathbb{R}$ . As $A$ is open in $\mathbb{R}$ , for all elements $f(a)\in A$ there is an $\varepsilon_{f(a)}>0$ such that $(f(a)-\varepsilon_{f(a)},f(a)+\varepsilon_{f(a)})$ is a subset of $A$ . So we can obtain an $a\in f^{-1}[(f(a)-\varepsilon_{f(a)},f(a)+\varepsilon_{f(a)})]$ . And because $f^{-1}[(f(a)-\varepsilon_{f(a)},f(a)+\varepsilon_{f(a)})]\subset f^{-1}(A)$ and $f^{-1}(A)$ is open, we choose a $\delta_a>0$ such that $(a-\delta_a,a+\delta_a)\subset f^{-1}[(f(a)-\varepsilon_{f(a)},f(a)+\varepsilon_{f(a)})]$ . Therefore, we have that $f[(a-\delta_a,a+\delta_a)]\subset (f(a)-\varepsilon_{f(a)},f(a)+\varepsilon_{f(a)})$ and we conclude that $f$ is continuous.","['continuity', 'general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

3913816,Usage/Application of Raychaudhuri equation in Riemann geometry or pure maths,While going through this paper by Witten and seeing a discussion about different aspects of Raychaudhari Equation and Einstein Field Equation. I want to ask if Raychaudhari Equation find any application in pure Maths specifically Riemann geometry since the only assumption in arriving it is to have a metric with signature $(-+ + +)$ and geodesic equation. Hence it can be applied in the modified theory of gravity as well. I searched the Raychaudhri equation in the A Panoramic View of Riemannian Geometry with no results while a google search gives no result as well. Finally searching on arXiv in Maths section only produces 7 results which are more or less about singularity theorem or the usual application of Raychaudari equation in GR. This really bugs me since Raychaudhari equation is essentially about the evolution of geodesic equations therefore they should find at least some application in pure maths.

3914169,How to properly work with Leibniz notation,"This question regards the manipulation of derivatives as if they were fractions. But more generally it also regards doing calculus in a ""Leibnizian"" way. Before asking I checked out the current poll of question regarding this topic: link , link and another one for good measure; my objective with this question is to fill in the holes that I think are left open in the discussion of this topic on this site. In the cited questions is clarified why is incorrect to define the derivate not as a limit but as a fraction, and the consequent importance of knowing the proper definition of the derivative as a limit. This is clear. But when working whit derivatives and integrals I think the usefulness of working with Leibniz notation, and interpreting derivatives as fractions, is beyond any doubt, as this answer points out. Problem is: when working with imprecise assumptions things can go wrong really fast, and for this reason interpreting the derivative as a fraction has the nomea of a pretty dangerous gamble. Here are some examples on how this can go terribly wrong: Example 1: $$\int \nabla \phi \cdot d\vec{x}=\int \frac{d\phi}{dx}dx+\frac{d\phi}{dy}dy+\frac{d\phi}{dz}dz=\int \frac{d\phi}{dx}dx+\int\frac{d\phi}{dy}dy+\int\frac{d\phi}{dz}dz=\phi+\phi+\phi=3\phi$$ but on the other hand if we state that: $d\phi+d\phi+d\phi=d\phi$ we get the correct result: $$\int \nabla \phi \cdot d\vec{x}=\int \frac{d\phi}{dx}dx+\frac{d\phi}{dy}dy+\frac{d\phi}{dz}dz=\int d\phi+d\phi+d\phi=\int d\phi=\phi$$ But if we write it with the proper notation of partial derivative then we should elide $\partial x$ with $dx$ , even more chaos. Example 2: $$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}/\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$$ by ""eliding the $\partial \phi$ "". And I am sure I could go on with more example, but I think there is no need. Question is: is there a ruleset to follow to ensure to not fall for mistakes like this when working with Leibniz notation? I feel like this question hasn't been properly answered in the previous discussion on this topic. And if there is such ruleset, why it works? Also it's often said that this way of handling derivatives and integrals no longer works when dealing with multivariable calculus, but from my experience it seems to give the correct answer even in this case, what is up with this exactly? Why should it no longer work? For example let's take the integral: $$\int \frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t} \cdot d\vec{x}$$ It would seem a bit difficult to solve this integral ""rigorously"", but by interpreting it in a somewhat Leibnizian way we get: $$\int \frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t} \cdot d\vec{x}=\int \frac{\partial A_x}{\partial t}dx+\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial t}dy+\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial t}dz=\int dA_x \frac{dx}{dt}+dA_y\frac{dy}{dt}+dA_z\frac{dz}{dt}=\int \vec{v} \cdot d\vec{A}=\vec{v}\cdot \vec{A}$$ This seems like a miracle, should we not use this way of working with things like this?","['integration', 'notation', 'calculus', 'partial-derivative', 'derivatives']"

In this case, the given distance corresponds to 3 diameters, so each is 3.33 units and the requested area is 100 sq. units. The two side circles overlap by 100%. Again the area is 100 sq. units. It is therefore obvious that the area is independent from the amount of overlapping, i.e. from the angle of the specific line segment to the horizontal line. Can you provide a geometrical solution?

3914469,Why do we not measure angles like this?,"An angle is a simple geometric figure that is obtained by taking a ray and rotating it about a point to form another ray, both of which have their starting point in common. The initial rays is called the initial side, the final one is called the terminal side and the common point is called the vertex. The point of measuring angles is to describe, in a way to what degree (pun intended) the initial line is rotated about the vertex to obtain the terminal line. The three usual measures of angles i.e. degree, radian and grads are dimensionless since they are all based on measuring an angle as a ratio of the arc length to the radius (I might be wrong, please let me know if I am). Now, let's say that we have an angle $AOB$ , as shown here : Here, $OP = OQ = 1~\mathrm{unit}$ . $L$ is the length of the arc $PQ$ . So, why can't we call say that $L$ is the angle measure of $\angle AOB$ (in a new angle measurement system). For such a system, the measure of any given angle will be the same as it's measure in radians, only the dimensionality will be different. The dimensionality of angle measure in this system becomes the same as of lengths. I don't see how that's a problem, though. Also, I find thinking about measuring angles like this much simpler than as a ratio of arc lengths. So, can this be called a valid way of measuring angles. If not, why?

3914560,Clock angle problem from simulation of planetary orbits,"Description I'm trying to reproduce a Solar System mathematically using ellipses. The initial conditions are: All ellipses will have a common foci $(0,0)$ , but different centers A planet orbiting an ellipse will have a period $T$ The position of a planet in the ellipse will be the reflected point (from the center of the ellipse) given the angle $\theta$ at time $t$ (*) Every ellipse can have a different initial phase angle $\theta_0$ Every ellipse can be rotated about the common foci $(0,0)$ To simplify the problem. We will assume conditions $4.$ and $5.$ are nonexistent. Here's a simple representation of a single ellipse: where $(j,k)$ is the center of the ellipse $(x,y)$ is the result of the
ellipse formula at angle $\theta$ $(x',y')$ is the reflected
point using the center as a mirror $\omega$ is the angle at point $(x',y')$ *: This is needed to simulate Kepler's second law Problem Given two ellipses (whose variables are denoted by subindex $_1$ and $_2$ in the following formulas), I'd like to find a formula that describes at which times $t$ , $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are equal. In other words, find the equation of $\omega$ in relation to time $t$ . Here's a gif that shows the specified system of two orbits: where The green dot is the center of the large ellipse The red dot is the center of the smaller ellipse The period of the large ellipse is $T_1 = 6$ s The period of the smaller ellipse is $T_2 = 14$ s The eccentricity of the large ellipse is 0.77 The eccentricity of the smaller ellipse is 0.75 The directrix of both ellipses is 2 So far, I've been able to figure out at which times $t$ both $\theta$ are equal: We know how $\theta$ varies in relation to $t$ , $$\theta = \frac{2\pi t}{T} + \theta_0$$ Since we have stablished that $\theta_0$ doesn't exist, $$\theta = \frac{2\pi t}{T}$$ We know that at time $t$ , both $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ must be equal: $$\theta_2 = \theta_1 + 2\pi k\ \ ,\  k \in \mathbb{Z}$$ where $2\pi k$ represents the periodicity of the orbit. If we substitute: $$\frac{2\pi t}{T_2} = \frac{2\pi t}{T_1} + 2\pi k\ \ ,\  k \in \mathbb{Z}$$ Solve for t: $$t = \frac{k}{\frac{1}{T_2}-\frac{1}{T_1}}$$ This formula gives me at which time $t$ both ellipses will have the same $\theta$ . If we substitute $T_1$ and $T_2$ with the periods of the ellipses in the example gif, we got for $k=1$ , $t=10.5$ s. If you look at the gif, after 10.5s, both red lines will be aligned, meaning $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ will be equal. Another way of finding this formula is using the polar expression of an ellipse: We know that the angle $\theta$ will be $$\theta = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}}$$ And we know that the point $(x,y)$ in polar coordinates is represented as: $$(x,y) = (r\cos{\theta}, r\sin{\theta})$$ Where $r$ is the distance from the center to the point $(x,y)$ , and this distance is given by the polar formula of an ellipse: $$r=\frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}$$ $$(x,y) = \left(\frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\cos{\theta}, \frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\sin{\theta}\right)$$ Going back to the formula described at step $1.$ , we have $$\theta = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}} = \arctan{\frac{\frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\sin{\theta}}{\frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\cos{\theta}}}$$ Simplifying, we have $$\theta = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}} = \arctan{\frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}} = \arctan{(tan{\theta})}$$ Again, we want both $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ to be equal: $$\arctan{\left(tan{\frac{2\pi t}{T_2}}\right)} = \arctan{\left(tan{\frac{2\pi t}{T_1}}\right)}$$ Which is equivalent to $$\frac{2\pi t}{T_2} = \frac{2\pi t}{T_1} + 2\pi k\ \ ,\  k \in \mathbb{Z}$$ So far so good. Now we want to find at which time $t$ , both $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are equal. We can use the second approach: We know that the point (x',y') is $$(x',y')=2(j,k)-(x,y) = (2j-x,2k-y)$$ And we already know how to represent $x$ and $y$ in relation to time: $$(x,y) = \left(\frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\cos{\theta}, \frac{ed}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\sin{\theta}\right)$$ This means that $(x',y')$ will be $$(x',y') = \left(2j-\frac{ed\cos{\theta}}{1+e\cos{\theta}}, 2k-\frac{ed\sin{\theta}}{1+e\cos{\theta}}\right)$$ Which means that the angle $\omega$ will be $$\omega = \arctan{\left(\frac{2k-\frac{ed\sin{\theta}}{1+e\cos{\theta}}}{2j-\frac{ed\cos{\theta}}{1+e\cos{\theta}}}\right)}$$ Since we want $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ to be equal $$\omega_2 = \omega_1 + 2\pi k$$ $$\arctan{\left(\frac{2k_2-\frac{e_2d_2\sin{\theta_2}}{1+e_2\cos{\theta_2}}}{2j_2-\frac{e_2d_2\cos{\theta_2}}{1+e_2\cos{\theta_2}}}\right)} = \arctan{\left(\frac{2k_1-\frac{e_1d_1\sin{\theta_1}}{1+e_1\cos{\theta_1}}}{2j_1-\frac{e_1d_1\cos{\theta_1}}{1+e_1\cos{\theta_1}}}\right)} + 2\pi k$$ and we know that $k_2=k_1=0$ since condition $5.$ doesn't apply: $$\arctan{\left(\frac{-\frac{e_2d_2\sin{\theta_2}}{1+e_2\cos{\theta_2}}}{2j_2-\frac{e_2d_2\cos{\theta_2}}{1+e_2\cos{\theta_2}}}\right)} = \arctan{\left(\frac{-\frac{e_1d_1\sin{\theta_1}}{1+e_1\cos{\theta_1}}}{2j_1-\frac{e_1d_1\cos{\theta_1}}{1+e_1\cos{\theta_1}}}\right)} + 2\pi k$$ Simplifying... $$\tan{\left(\frac{2\pi t}{T_1}\right)}e_2d_2(4j_1-e_1d_1) = tan{\left(\frac{2\pi t}{T_2}\right)}e_1d_1(4j_2-e_2d_2)$$ At which point, I got stuck. WolframAlpha does not give me a clear answer for $t$ , and if I substitute the example gif variables in this formula, WolframAlpha gives 5 possible $t$ , of which 3 contain an imaginary number $i$ . Which doesn't make sense since time doesn't have 2 dimensions. Questions Am I doing something wrong? Is there a more elegant solution to this problem that I'm not aware of?

-4xy + x^2 - y^2 + 4x^2 \frac{dy}{dx} = 0

We need to match this form: $$M(x,y) + N(x,y) \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$ Then we find $M(x,y)$ and $N(x,y)$ : $$M(x,y) = -4xy + x^2 -y^2$$ $$N(x,y) = 4x^2$$ From this we get two differential equations: $$\frac{d\Psi(x,y)}{dx} = M(x,y)$$ $$\frac{d\Psi(x,y)}{dy} = N(x,y)$$ It is not important which one we solve by integrating.
Here we integrate the first one. $$\Psi(x,y) = \int M(x,y) dx  $$ $$= \int -4xy + x^2 - y^2  dx $$ $$= -2x^2y + \frac{x^3}{3} -xy^2  + C(y) = \Psi(x,y)$$ So far so good. From this onward I try to methods and both fail. First ATTEMPT: Integrating the other differential equation we get $$ 4x^2y  + D(x) = \Psi(x,y)$$ comparing the two $$ 4x^2y  + D(x) = \Psi(x,y) =-2x^2y + \frac{x^3}{3} -xy^2  + C(y)  $$ not sure what to do next since it is not easy to deduce the $C(y)$ and $D(x)$ from here. Second ATTEMPT: Now we use the OTHER differential equation: $$\frac{d\Psi(x,y)}{dy} = N(x,y)= 4x^2$$ and we use the $\Psi(x,y)$ that we found. We now need to find $C(y)$ . $$\frac{d\Psi(x,y)}{dy} = 4x^2$$ $$ -2x^2 -2xy + \frac{dC(y)}{dy}= 4x^2$$ $$ -6x^2 -2xy + \frac{dC(y)}{dy}= 0$$ integrating everything with respect to y
with constant of integration K(x), we get $$ -6x^2y -xy^2 + C(y) + K(x) = 0 $$ solve the above for $C(y)$ $$ C(y) = 6x^2y +  xy^2 - K(x) $$ and substitute into $\Psi(x,y)$ to get $$\Psi(x,y) = -2x^2y + \frac{x^3}{3} -xy^2 + 6x^2y +  xy^2 - K(x)  = 0   $$ $$\Psi(x,y) =  \frac{x^3}{3}  + 4x^2y  -K(x)  = 0   $$ we differentiate with respect to x $$\frac{d\Psi(x,y)}{dx} = M(x,y)$$ $$ x^2 + 8xy - \frac{dK(x)}{dx}= -4xy + x^2 -y^2 $$ $$ y^2 + 12xy  =  \frac{dK(x)}{dx} $$ $$ xy^2 + 6x^2y + Q  =  K(x) $$ $$\Psi(x,y) =  \frac{x^3}{3}  + 4x^2y - xy^2 - 6x^2y    + Q    = 0   $$ $$\Psi(x,y) =  \frac{x^3}{3}  -2x^2y - xy^2  + Q  = 0   $$ However I think here we get into an infinite loop because $Q$ is actually $Q(y)$ which
needs to be determined using a similiar integration ... so again I don't know what to do.

3914921,Biharmonic functions on closed manifolds?,"Let $(M,g)$ be a closed (compact, $\partial M=\varnothing$ ) smooth connected Riemannian manifold with Laplace–Beltrami operator $\Delta_g$ . As it is well-known, every harmonic function ( $u\in \ker \Delta_g$ ) on $M$ is constant (e.g. Hodge Isomorphism Theorem). Question: What about biharmonic functions ( $u\in \ker \Delta_g^2$ )?
In particular, can we say that every (everywhere defined, at least continuous) (distributionally) biharmonic function on $M$ is constant? A few remarks: of course, the answer is negative on non-compact manifolds (think polynomials on $\mathbb R^n$ ), as well as on bounded domains with appropriate boundary conditions. (See e.g. this question ). Equivalently, we may look for smooth solutions to the Poisson equation $\Delta_g u\equiv 1$ . By multiplying on both sides by $u$ and integrating w.r.t. the Riemannian volume $\mu_g$ we get: $$\int u \Delta_g u d\!\mu_g=\int |du|^2 d\!\mu_g=\int u d\!\mu_g$$ If $u$ has mean $0$ , we immediately get that it is constant. If otherwise, we may assume that $\int u d\!\mu_g=1$ , in which case the same holds for $|du|^2$ . In particular if $u$ is a solution to the eikonal equation $|du|^2\equiv\mu_g(M)^{-1}$ , then it is biharmonic. If we allow $du$ to have a singularity at some point $x_0$ in $M$ , then this solution should be (?) the Green kernel for the bi-Laplacian pinned at $x_0$ . If however $du\equiv 1$ everywhere, I do not see why a solution should exist.","['laplacian', 'partial-differential-equations', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

For simplicity let's assume $M$ is a smooth $k$ -manifold, $\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow M$ is a smooth curve on $M$ and that $\omega \in \Omega^1(M)$ . Then by definition, $$\int_{\gamma} \omega = \int_{[a,b]} \gamma^* \omega$$ In coordinates $(x^i)$ we can write $\omega = \omega_i dx^i$ so that we then have $$\int_{[a,b]} \gamma^* \omega = \int_a^b (\omega_i \circ \gamma)d\gamma^i = \int_a^b (\omega_i \circ \gamma) \frac{d\gamma^i}{dt}dt$$ From an elementary calculus point of view, when integrating, we take the value of $(\omega_i \circ \gamma) \frac{d\gamma^i}{dt}$ at a point on some subrectangle of some partition, which gives us a real number. We then multiply it by the length of the subrectangle (which is approximated by $dt$ ), which is also a real number and we add these products up, then let the mesh of the partition tend to $0$ . From a differential forms point of view, $(\omega_i \circ \gamma) \frac{d\gamma^i}{dt}$ is a function that is being multiplied by the $1$ -form $dt$ . The value of $(\omega_i \circ \gamma) \frac{d\gamma^i}{dt}$ at a point of a subrectangle is a real number, but the value of $dt$ , since it is a covector field , is a covector. Thus the value of $(\omega_i \circ \gamma) \frac{d\gamma^i}{dt} dt$ at a point of a subrectangle is a covector as well. How does it make sense to sum up a bunch of covectors to obtain a real number (the value of the integral)?","['line-integrals', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"

First, consider that $$f'(a) =f'(b)=0$$ Then, consider the function $g:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , where $g(x) = \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$ and $g(a) = 0$ . Show that $g$ reaches it's maximum or minimum in a point $c \in (a,b)$ . For the general case, consider $$g(x) = f(x) - xf'(a)$$ I can see why the first case: if a take the derivative of g, I end up with something like: $$g'(x) = \frac{1}{x - a} \left( f'(x) - \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \right)$$ So, by being continuous (from the differentiable hypothesis) on a compact set, by Weierstrass's Theorem, we have that $g$ must have it's maximum/minimum on $c \in [a,b]$ . By being a critical point, we must have $g'(c) = 0$ , and assuming $c \neq a$ , we have our first conclusion. But (1) I can't see why it must be a interior point (seriously, I've been on this question for 4 days), and (2) the second suggestion isn't that clear for me.

However, I want to prove the same bound of this operator norm on the whole $L^{2}([0,1])$ .  Is there anyway for me to extend this proof to all of $f\in L^{2}([0,1])$ ? and to conclude $\|T^{n}\|\leq\frac{1}{n!}$ My attempt was to use density of continuous function of compact support in $L^{2}$ to find $g$ such that $f=g+\epsilon$ where $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrarily fixed. Then we bound the integral in the same way, and you will have a summation, the second term in the summation will go to $0$ when $\epsilon\searrow 0$ . Therefore, we again have $$|(T^{n}f)(x)|\dfrac{\|g\|_{\infty}}{n!}.$$ But this cannot say anything to the operator norm $\|T\|$ . What should I do? Thank you! Edit: The overall purpose is to derive that $\|T\|\leq\frac{1}{n!}$ . So if there is any other way to find this, it will also be really good. Edit2: Proof Okay, I confused myself in the first place. The operator norm has nothing to do with the sup-norm since $T:L^{2}\longrightarrow L^{2}$ , so what we should do is to use Cauchy-Schwarz and $\|f\|_{L^{2}}$ . See below my own answer to my post for details. Also, Ruy gave a general theorem about how to compute the operator norm for Hilbert-Schmidt operator, and my computation will show you the idea about the proof. Basically, the absolute value of operator will be bounded by $\|f\|_{L^{2}}$ multiplication of the $L^{2}-$ integral of the kernel, so we should expect such a theorem.

3915192,Classification of degree 3 rational maps on a hyperelliptic curve,"It's amazing how far in life you can get with theorems, without stopping to do any calculations. Let $\Sigma_2$ be a genus $2$ curve embedded in the projective plane given by the equation $z^4 y^2 = \prod_{i=1}^6 (x - z \zeta_i)$ in homogenous coordinates, with the $\zeta_i$ of course being the fixed points of the hyperelliptic involution. I want to understand what the possible degree $3$ rational maps are from $\Sigma_2$ to $\mathbb{CP}^1$ . Since the maps I'm interested in are rational maps, we just work in affine coordinates. This is convenient because as written, such a curve is singular at $[0:1:0]$ in the projective plane, and I don't want to have to compute the normalization. Now this reduces the problem to fidning when $[\mathbb{C}(x,y):f^\ast(\mathbb{C}(t))] = 3$ where $t$ is the local coordinate on $\mathbb{C}$ , and $x,y$ satisfy $y^2 = \prod(x-\zeta_i)$ . Prima facie this happens in two ways. By finding a degree $1$ map from $\Sigma_2 \to \mathbb{CP}^1$ and composing with a degree $3$ map from the sphere to itself, and by finding a genuine degree $3$ map. The former isn't possible though, since a degree $1$ map would be an isomorphism. Such a map is of course defined by what it does to $t$ . So I send $t \mapsto F(x,y)$ . Is there a strategy for computing the degree? Somehow I have made it this far in my life and only seen trivial examples, where the fields in question are things like $\mathbb{Q}(\text{radicals and stuff})$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ . In an attempt to figure this out, I noticed that I can write this as $F(x,y) = \frac{P(x,y)}{Q(x,y)}$ , and then $P,Q$ can be written as polynomials in $y$ , i.e. $P(x) = P_1(x) + yP_2(x)$ using the equation of the curve. Now the degree of $F$ is the difference of the degrees of $P$ and $Q$ , so I just need to compute these degrees. I believe that the degree of $y$ is $6$ (after being enlightened in the comments) since a generic choice of $y$ , we will obtain a polynomial of degree $6$ , having $6$ solutions. and the degree of $P_1, Q_1$ should be simply their degrees as polynomials in $x$ . Is all this correct? If so, then I think this tells us roughly how to classify the maps on hyperelliptic curves of a given degree.","['algebraic-geometry', 'solution-verification']"

I have seen the following result get used in a few contexts before, and although I can see intuitively why it must be true, I have been unable to find a rigorous argument justifying the same: Fact(?) Let $H$ be a hyperplane and $P$ any point in $\mathbb P^n \setminus H$ . Then there exists a linear transformation $A \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ such that $A(H)$ is the hyperplane $\{(x_0, \cdots , x_n) : x_0=0\}$ and $A(P) = (1, 0, \cdots , 0)$ . I am looking for a complete and concise proof of this result, which is clean if possible. I believe that one possible argument could rest on the following observations: $H$ is uniquely determined by any $n$ points on it. So we now pick $n+1$ points $P_1, \cdots , P_n$ on $H$ . There exists a linear transformation sending $P$ to $(1, 0, \cdots,  0)$ and $P_j$ to $(0, \cdots , 0 , 1, 0, \cdots, 0) \in \mathbb P^n$ ( $0$ in the $j$ -th slot, here the $n+1$ slots are being called the $0$ -th, $1$ -st, ..., $n$ -th slot slots) for each $1 \leq j \leq n$ . I have however been unable to make these clean and rigorous (I keep getting involved with too many linear equations) and am starting to doubt the accuracy of my intuition. I would really appreciate a complete argument for the above ""Fact(?)"" or a reference containing the same and if possible, suggestions on how to make my idea work. Edit (Some Progress): Thanks to Roland's comment, I think I have made some progress: Let $H$ be given by the equation $\sum_{j=0}^n a_j x_j = 0$ . Then in $\mathbb A^{n+1}$ , $H$ remains the same (nevertheless I will call it $H_0$ when viewed as a subset of $\mathbb A^{n+1}$ ) while $P := (p_0, \cdots , p_n)$ becomes the line $L_0 := \{(p_0 t, \cdots , p_n t) : t \in k\}$ . I should first show that there is a matrix $A \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ such that $A(H_0) = H_1$ and $A(L_0)=L_1$ , where $H_1 := \{(0, x_1, \cdots , x_n) : x_j \in k\} \subset \mathbb A^{n+1}$ and $L_1$ is the line $\{(t, 0, \cdots , 0) : t \in k\} \subset A^{n+1}$ . So now I can pick $n$ linearly independent points $A_j \in H_0$ ( $1 \leq j \leq n$ ), which is possible since $H_0$ is an $n$ -dimensional subspace of $\mathbb A^{n+1}$ and I get a linear transformation $A \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ which sends $A_j$ to $(0, \cdots , 0 , 1, 0, \cdots 0)$ (with $1$ in the $j$ -th slot) for each $1 \leq j \leq n$ . Thus $A$ sends $H_0$ to $H_1$ . I still have to send $A(L_0)$ to $L_1$ so I need a linear transformation $T \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ which sends $A(L_0)$ (which is also a line through the origin) to $L_1$ and leaves $H_1$ invariant (as a set). Finally, we let $T \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ be the linear transformation that sends $(p_0, \cdots , p_n) \in \mathbb A^{n+1}$ to $(1, 0, \cdots , 0)$ and fixes some basis of $H_1$ pointwise. Upon getting this last linear transformation $T$ , we note that $TA \in \text{GL}_{n+1}(k)$ sends $H_0$ to $H_1$ and $L_0$ to $L_1$ in $\mathbb A^{n+1}$ . Therefore $TA$ should also do the required job, namely, send $H$ to $\{(0, x_1, \cdots , x_n)\} \subset \mathbb P^n$ and $P$ to $(1, 0, \cdots 0)$ , thus completing the proof and making ""Fact(?)""$ a fact.

3915595,Smooth function with specific features,"Im looking for a function that's continuous everywhere and whose second derivative is continuous everywhere with the following properties: Near the origin, the function is approximately constant: $$f\approx c$$ with $c \in \mathbb{R}$ Far from the origin (outside some scale), the function is approximately linear: $$f(x) \approx m*x+b$$ with $m \neq 0$ So the function would look like . I just defined this function piecewise in mathematica as an example, but the second derivative is not continuous, because the curvy bits are quadratic and the flat bits are linear, so the second derivative is a series of steps. I will eventually define a vector field from this scalar field which describes a flow in a flat manifold. Moreover, there is an energy functional that is defined in terms of the second derivatives of this scalar field, hence the reason for continuity. I tried using bump functions and integrating backwards to get the scalar field I want, but the integrals became messy quite fast, as you might expect. Similarly, I tried using hyperbolic tangents, but I wasn't able to smoothly attach the pieces together. I am also trying to minimize the magnitude of the second derivative (because it relates to the energy functional). So I am hoping to find a function that approaches the origin in a linear way, then curves in such a way that the second derivative has constant sign, then approaches zero again, then has constant opposite sign. Here is an example of such a second derivative using bump functions. I tried integrating this and using the integration constants to satisfy my required properties, but the integrals are quite messy!

(2 answers) Closed 3 years ago . Determine all sets of non-negative integers x,y and z which satisfy the equation $2^x + 3^y = z^2$ This came in the 1992 INMO and curiously enough also seems to have been included on the 1996 BMO Round 2? I have never heard of a question being directly copied from another Olympiad so this was a first for me. Anyways, first, I looked at the case $y=0$ . This quickly gave me one solution, viz $(x,y,z)=(3,0,3)$ Next, I considered $x,y,z>0$ We know $2^x + 3^y \equiv (-1)^x+0 \bmod 3$ and that perfect squares are $\equiv 0,1 \bmod 3$ . It is easy to see that the only combination that works is $x$ be even and $z=3m+1$ type $\Rightarrow z$ is odd Also, we know that odd perfect squares are $\equiv 1 \bmod 4$ . Further, $3^y\equiv (-1)^y \bmod 4$ and since $x$ is even it implies that $x≥2$ thus $2^x$ is divisible by $4$ . This further implies that $(-1)^y \equiv 1 \bmod 4 \Rightarrow y$ is also even. Let $x=2k$ . Then our original expression becomes $$3^y=(z+2^k)(z-2^k)$$ We have two possibilities: first is that $(z-2^k)=1$ and $(z+2^k)=3^y$ and second is $(z-2^k)=3^{y-a}$ and $(z+2^k)=3^a$ . But since we previously established that $z=3k±1$ and as $2^k \equiv (-1)^y \bmod 3$ , we can quickly discard the second possibility. So we finally have, $$(z-2^k)=1$$ $$(z+2^k)=3^y$$ Here I got woefully stuck. Another thing I got was that $k$ is also even (which means $x$ is itself a multiple of $4$ ). One more thing is that since $y$ is even $3^y$ is divisible by $9$ . I don't know how we can use this fact right now but I thought it could be worth mentioning.

I have been able to show that the said projection is the zero set of the homogenous polynomial $f(x,y,z):= y^3-x^2z \in k[x,y,z]$ so it is a cubic curve. From some searching, I learnt that a cuspidal curve is one where all singularities are cusps and by using the characterization of singular points in projective curves defined by a single equation as points where all partial derivatives vanish, I have been able to show that the only singularity of $f$ occurs at the point $(0, 0, 1) \in \mathbb P^2$ . Now I am not sure how to show that this point is a cusp, because I require a rigorous definition of ""cusp"" in this context which is easy to verify. Most references I came across give a definition to the effect that a ""cusp"" is a point where two ""branches"" have a common semi-tangent, and the notion of ""branch"" is either handwaved or explained only for Euclidean spaces.

For example, the first question proves that $(A/I)\otimes (B/J)\cong (A\otimes B)/(I\otimes 1+1\otimes J)$ . Question: By using category theory, can we see this isomorphism is natural? What I mean by natural isomorphism is that the isomorphism between $(A/I)\otimes (B/J)$ and $(A\otimes B)/(I\otimes 1+1\otimes J)$ is exactly given by the obvious map $\bar{a}\otimes\bar{b}\rightarrow\overline{a\otimes b}$ .

Find the MLE of the population variance $\beta^{2}$ . My approach: I know that Method of Maximum Likelihood: Suppose that the likelihood depends on $k$ parameters $\theta_{1},\theta_{2},\ldots,\theta_{k}$ . Choose those values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood $\mathbb{L}[y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n}|\theta_{1},\theta_{2}\ldots,\theta_{k}]$ . So, in my problem a need to find the value of the parameter $\beta^{2}$ sucht that maximize the $$\mathbb{L}[x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}|\beta^{2}]:=\mathbb{L}[\beta^{2}]$$ But I know that if $t(\theta)$ is a one-to-one function of $\theta$ and if $\hat{\theta}$ is the MLE for $\theta$ , so the MLE of $t(\theta)$ is given by $$\hat{t(\theta)}=t(\hat{\theta})$$ This result, sometimes refered to as the invariance property of MLEs . Now, using that result, I think I can calculate first $$\mathbb{L}(y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n}|\beta)=f(y_{1}|\beta)\times f(y_{2}|\beta)\times \cdots f(y_{n}|\beta)$$ where $f(y_{i}|\beta)$ is the density functio of the $Y_{i}\sim \mathbf{Exp}(\beta)$ . So, we have \begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbb{L}(\beta)&=&\left(\frac{1}{\beta}\right)^{n}\mathbf{exp}\left[\frac{-y_{1}-y_{2}-\cdots -y_{n}}{\beta}\right]
\end{eqnarray*} Question: How can I write the support of $\mathbb{L}[\beta]$ ? Also, I know  to do $\frac{d\mathbb{L}[\beta]}{d \beta}=0$ , and so we have $$\frac{d}{d\beta}\left(\left(\frac{1}{\beta}\right)^{n}\mathbf{exp}\left[\frac{-y_{1}-y_{2}-\cdots -y_{n}}{\beta}\right] \right)=0$$ since that $\ln(\mathbb{L}[\beta]$ and $\mathbb{L}[\beta]$ reach the maximum in the same $\beta$ , by monotony, then we can calculate $\beta$ in $$\frac{\ln(\mathbb{L}[\beta])}{d\beta}=0 \implies \frac{1}{\beta^{2}}\sum_{1\leq i \leq n}y_{i}=\frac{n}{\beta} \implies \beta=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{1\leq i \leq n}y_{i}=\overline{Y}_n$$ So, we have that $$\hat{\beta}_{MLE}=\overline{Y}_n$$ Now, by invariance property we can see that $$\hat{\beta}^{2}_{MLE}=\overline{Y}_n^{2}$$ Is correct my solution?

Bad assumption.  See below. So a related question would be, are these really the foci of this ellipse? If not, then how to construct them properly?

3916742,Expected time until random walk on hexagonal grid exceeds distance N from start,"A particle starts in a cell in an infinite hexagonal grid, and every second, jumps to an adjacent cell uniformly randomly. What is the expected amount of time until the particle is $N$ cell-jumps away from its starting point? With some linear algebra, for example, one finds values of $1$ , then $10/3$ , then $213/29$ , for cases $N=1,2,3$ respectively. Computer simulation shows growth is approximately $4N^2/5$ . I expected to be able to solve this problem with similar methods (using polynomials in barycentric coordinates, constrained by dihedral symmetries) as to my recent Puzzling question , but to no avail so far. Curiously, by a coupling argument, this problem is equivalent to computing the expected value of the variable $\text{min}\{X_1,X_2\}$ where $X_i$ are iid variables representing the escape time of the honeybee from the center of its triangle in the linked problem, but that observation doesn't seem to help much. Some rambling about my current attempts: In barycentric coordinates $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ whereby we always have $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 3N$ , it would seem reasonable to demand that—in order to find the average escape time at $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ from the $N-1$ -hexagon centered at $(N,N,N)$ —we find a function $H(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ algebraically satisfying the ""average-of-6-neighbors-plus-1"" property everywhere, which also satisfies $H = 0$ whenever $\alpha = 0, 2N$ or $\beta = 0, 2N$ or $\gamma = 0, 2N$ . After all, this approach is exactly how the triangular escape time problem is solved, just leaving out the $2N$ constraints. In that case, we think of the elementary symmetric polynomials in $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ , and realize $\alpha\beta\gamma$ is a good candidate. It doesn't quite satisfy the averaging-plus-one law—its difference from its nearby-average function is $3N$ and not $1$ —so we tweak it to $\frac{3\alpha\beta\gamma}{\alpha+\beta+\gamma}$ to solve the problem. So that is how I proceeded here, examining the obvious candidate $H=\alpha \beta \gamma (\alpha-2\beta-2\gamma)(\beta-2\alpha-2\gamma)(\gamma-2\alpha-2\beta)$ . But its difference from its nearby-average function is gnarly, and not susceptible to obvious tweaks. With some thought, one realizes the field of rational functions invariant up to angular and mirror symmetry are generated by $H$ as well as $e_1 = \alpha+\beta+\gamma$ and $e_2 = \alpha \beta + \alpha \gamma + \beta\gamma$ . Especially considering the empirical evidence that our formula will be of degree $2$ , one might try candidate tweaks like $\frac{H}{e_1^4}$ or $\frac{H}{e_1^2 e_2}$ or $\frac{H}{e_2^2}$ or $\frac{H^2}{e_1^4 e_2^3}$ ... but some time spent in Mathematica proved fruitless. It's become clear to me now that no rational function of the form $\frac{F}{e_1^n e_2^m}$ will satisfy the criteria of the first paragraph , because such a function will still be defined on and inside the full triangular region, thus restricting to a solution of the honeybee escape time problem. By standard Markov chain reasoning, this solution is unique, and obviously not the solution to the problem at hand. So, either an even more complicated denominator is needed (one giving poles outside the hexagon but inside the triangle), or we need to allow possibilities like $H \neq 0$ even if $\alpha = 0$ as long as we're outside the hexagonal boundary, or we need some even more radical change to our techniques.","['random-walk', 'statistics', 'markov-chains', 'probability']"
