2850025,"Building neighborhoods around arbitrary real numbers that will contain ""minimal"" number of elements from the sequence $a_n=n\sin \frac{\pi n}{4}$","Suppose we are given the sequence $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ defined by the rule $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, a_n=n\sin \frac{\pi n}{4}$. We can show that this is equivalent to: $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},a_n= \begin{cases} 
      \frac{n}{\sqrt{2}} & n \equiv 1\pmod{8} \lor n \equiv 3\pmod{8} \\
      n & n \equiv 2\pmod{8} \\
      0 & n \equiv 0\pmod{8}\lor n \equiv 4\pmod{8} \\
      -\frac{n}{\sqrt{2}} & n \equiv 5\pmod{8} \lor n \equiv 7\pmod{8} \\
      -n & n\equiv 6 \pmod{8}
   \end{cases}
$ Now the problem is to prove\show that around each number we take $L\in\mathbb{R}$ we can create\build a neighborhood such that: If $L$ does not equal to any element in the sequence $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, Then we can build a neighborhood of $L$ such that no other element from the sequence will reside in it. If $L$ equals some element in the sequence $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, Then , If $L$ equals zero (as zero is an element in the sequence), Then we can build a neighborhood of $L$ that will contain an infinite number of elements from the sequence, And If $L$ does not equals zero, Then we can build a neighborhood of $L$ that will contain exactly one element from the sequence. Translating the problem into logic/set-theory notation we get that we have to show: If $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, L\neq a_n$, Then $\exists \epsilon\in (0,\infty), |\{n\in\mathbb{N}|a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)\}|=0$ If $\exists m\in\mathbb{N}, L= a_m$, Then , If $L=0$, Then $\exists \epsilon\in (0,\infty), |\{n\in\mathbb{N}|a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)\}|=\aleph_0$, And If $L\neq 0$, Then $\exists \epsilon\in (0,\infty), |\{n\in\mathbb{N}|a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)\}|=1$ Note: The notation $N_\epsilon (L)$ denotes the neighborhood of $L$ with radius $\epsilon$, I.e. $N_\epsilon(L)=(L-\epsilon,L+\epsilon)$ My try for proving 1: Since in this case it is given that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, L\neq a_n$ we can conclude that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, a_n-L\neq 0$ and thus $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, | a_n-L|>0$, Now If we define the set $A=\{|a_n-L| | n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ we get that this set is a non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded below by $0$ and thus its infimum $\inf(A)=\inf\limits_{n\in\mathbb{N}} |a_n-L|$ exists and satisfies $\inf\limits_{n\in\mathbb{N}}|a_n-L|\geq 0$ (as $0$ is a lower bound of $A$ and thus must be less than or equal to its infimum), Now if we just show that $\inf\limits_{n\in\mathbb{N}}|a_n-L|>0$ we could choose $\epsilon=\inf\limits_{n\in\mathbb{N}}|a_n-L|\in (0,\infty)$ and we would get that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, a_n\notin N_\epsilon(L)$ because if we suppose by contradiction that $\exists n\in\mathbb{N}, a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)$, Then we would get by the fact that $|a_n-L|\in A$ and by definition of infimum that $|a_n-L|\geq \inf(A)=\inf\limits_{n\in\mathbb{N}}|a_n-L|=\epsilon$ which contradicts the fact that $a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)$ (which is equivalent to $|a_n-L|<\epsilon$), Thus it must be the case that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},a_n\notin N_\epsilon(L)$ and we can conclude that $\{n\in\mathbb{N}|a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)\}=\emptyset$ and thus $|\{n\in\mathbb{N}|a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)\}|=0$ as was to be shown. My try for proving 2: Since in this case it is given that $\exists m\in\mathbb{N}, L = a_m$,
And since $0$ is in the image of $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ (i.e. $0$ is an element in the set $\{a_n|n\in\mathbb{N}\}$) we get that there are two possibilities: $L=0$ or $L\neq 0$ If $L=0$, Any $\epsilon$ we choose from the set $(0,\infty)$ will work, As we can define the set $T=\{n\in\mathbb{N}|n\equiv 0 \pmod{8}\}$ and it is clear that for this set we have $\forall n\in T, a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)$ [because $\forall n\in T, a_n=0$ and because $0\in N_\epsilon(0)=N_\epsilon(L)$], And therefore we get that $T\subseteq \{n\in\mathbb{N}|a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)\}\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, But since $|T| = |\mathbb{N}| =\aleph_0$ we get that it must be the case that $|\{n\in\mathbb{N}|a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)\}|=\aleph_0$ as was to be shown. Now if $L\neq 0$, We can define the set $A=\{|a_n-L| | m\neq n\in\mathbb{N}\}$, And we get that this set is a non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded below by $0$ and thus its infimum $\inf(A)=\inf\limits_{m\neq n\in\mathbb{N}} |a_n-L|$ exists and satisfies $\inf\limits_{m\neq n\in\mathbb{N}}|a_n-L|\geq 0$ (as $0$ is a lower bound of $A$ and thus must be less than or equal to its infimum), Now if we just show that $\inf\limits_{m\neq n\in\mathbb{N}}|a_n-L|>0$ we could choose $\epsilon=\inf\limits_{m\neq n\in\mathbb{N}}|a_n-L|\in (0,\infty)$ and we would get that $\forall m\neq n\in\mathbb{N}, a_n\notin N_\epsilon(L)$ because if we suppose by contradiction that $\exists m\neq n\in\mathbb{N}, a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)$, Then we would get by the fact that $|a_n-L|\in A$ and by definition of infimum that $|a_n-L|\geq \inf(A)=\inf\limits_{m\neq n\in\mathbb{N}}|a_n-L|=\epsilon$ which contradicts the fact that $a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)$ (which is equivalent to $|a_n-L|<\epsilon$), Thus it must be the case that $\forall m\neq n\in\mathbb{N},a_n\notin N_\epsilon(L)$ and we can conclude that $\{n\in\mathbb{N}|a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)\}=\{m\}$ (because $L=a_m$) and thus $|\{n\in\mathbb{N}|a_n\in N_\epsilon(L)\}|=1$ as was to be shown.

2850095,Entropy of a Measure Preserving Transformation,"I am reading the concept of entropy from Peter Walters' An Introduction to Ergodic Theory and I am having trouble understanding the notion of the entropy of a measure preserving transformation. Definitions: Let $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ be a probability space.
For a partition $\xi=\{A_1 , \ldots, A_m\}$ of $X$ (where each $A_i$ is measurable) the entropy of $\xi$ is defined as: $$
H(\xi) = -\sum_{i=1}^m \mu(A_i)\log(\mu(A_i))
$$ If $T:X\to X$ is a measure preserving transformation, we write $T^{-1}\xi$ to denote the set $\set{T^{-1}(A_i):\ 1\leq i\leq m}$ .
Thus $H(T^{-1}\xi)=H(\xi)$ . Now the entropy of a measure preserving transformation $T:X\to X$ with respect to $\xi$ is defined as (see Def. 4.9 in the aforementioned text) $$
h(T, \xi) = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{n} H\left(\bigvee_{i=0}^{n-1} T^{-i}\xi\right),
$$ where $\bigvee_{i=0}^{n-1} T^{-1}\xi$ is the coarsest common refinement of the partitions $T^{-i}\xi$ . The Problem: Just after giving the definition, the author writes This means that if we think of an application of $T$ as a passage of one day of time, then $\bigvee_{i=1}^{n-1}T^{-i}\xi$ represents the combined experiment of performing the original experiment, represented by $\xi$ , on $n$ consecutive days.
Then $h(T, \xi)$ is the average information per day that one gets from performing the original experiment. I do not entirely follows this. If the application of $T$ is the passage of one day, that is, it takes us one day into the future, why is the expression $\bigvee_{i=1}^{n-1} T^{-i}\xi$ is the combined experiment (wait, what is intuitive meaning of 'combined experiment'?) for the next $n$ -days. We are taking backward images of $T$ in this expression, not the forward images. At any rate, I do not have any intuition for the last definition presented above.
Can someone please try to give some insight. Thanks.","['intuition', 'information-theory', 'entropy', 'ergodic-theory', 'measure-theory']"

2850117,The Dihedral Constant Center of a Tetrahedron,"For opposing edges in a tetrahedron, define $p\otimes q = p^2 + q^2 + 2 p q \cot(\angle p)\cot(\angle q)$, where $\angle p$ is the inner dihedral angle of edge $p$.

2850128,"Prove that the set of all monotone functions on $[0,1]$ has same cardinality as $\mathbb R$","I am having difficulty answering the following question on ""Notes on Set Theory"" by Moschovakis, 1st edition: Prove that the set $K$ of all monotone real functions on the closed interval $[0,1]$ have the same cardinality with $\mathbb R$. We can inject $\mathbb R$ into $K$ by sending any real number to its constant function, e.g. $5/2$ gets mapped to the constant function $5/2$ on $[0,1]$. By Schroder-Berstein theorem, it suffices to provide an injection from $K$ to $\mathbb R$. As the set of constant functions in $K$ have cardinality of $\mathbb R$, strictly decreasing function in $K$ (by which I mean that such a function $f$ has some $a > b$ st. $f(a) <f(b)$, i.e. $f$ need not be strictly decreasing in the whole interval) is in bijective correspondence with strictly increasing function in $K$, and $|\mathbb R^3| = |\mathbb R|$, it suffices to show that the set of strictly increasing function in $K$ injects to $\mathbb R$. However, I am not sure how I can provide such an injection.","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"

2850191,"Intermediate inequalities; is there a way to know if you're getting a ""bad deal""?","Let's say I want to prove a contest-style inequality $f(a, b, c) + g(a, b, c) \ge h(a, b, c)$ in some $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ .

For example, is it possible that applying AM-GM to $a^2+2b+c$ and $b^2+2a+c$ gives a very bad inequality, but applying something like $\dfrac {ab}{c}$ and $\dfrac {bc}{a}$ gives a very good inequality?

2850278,Testing whether a set of permutations is a subgroup of $S_5$,"I'm trying to go through the process of determining whether a set of permutations is a subgroup. I was hoping someone could look over the logic of this answer for completeness and soundness of logic. I think I understand, ultimately, how to check this, but I worry that I'm 'reinventing the wheel' when there's a much easier, more intuitive approach. (In other words, I would never want to replicate something like this on a timed exam.) We have the set: $\{\text{id}, (12345), (13524), (14253), (15432)\}$. We need to check four properties: (a) Associativity: This is trivially the case, as it holds for all permutations and for the group, $S_5$, so it will surely hold for a subset of that group, regardless of whether those permutations form a subgroup. (b) Identity: The identity permutation is indeed included in this set. (c) Closure: I think the only way to check this is to take all possible compositions of the permutations in the group and ensure that they produce elements in the group. The identity, clearly, will produce any of the permutations we compose it with, and it commutes, so we can for the moment omit that from our verification process. Let's denote these permutations as: 
\begin{align*}
& (12345) = \sigma \\
& (13524) = \beta \\
& (14253) = \tau \\
& (15432) = \gamma
\end{align*}
I then can check each of these. Upon working these out on scrap paper (the easiest way would perhaps be with a group table), I get: 
\begin{align*}
& \tau \sigma = (15432) = \gamma \\
& \sigma \tau = (15432) = \gamma \\
& \gamma \sigma = \text{id} \\
& \sigma \gamma = \text{id} \\
& \beta \sigma = (14253) = \tau \\
& \sigma \beta = (14253) = \tau \\
& \tau \sigma = (15432) = \gamma \\
& \sigma \sigma = (13524) = \beta \\
& \beta \tau = \text{id} \\
& \tau \beta = \text{id} \\
& \gamma \tau = (15432) = \beta \\
& \tau \gamma = (13524) = \beta \\
& \tau \tau = (12345) = \sigma \\
& \beta \gamma = (12345) = \sigma \\
& \gamma \beta = (12345) = \sigma \\
& \beta \beta = (15432) = \gamma \\
& \gamma \gamma = (14253) = \tau
\end{align*}
So, we can see from this that the group is closed under composition of permutations. Inverses: The inverse of the identity is clearly the identity. The inverse of $\beta$ is $\tau$, and thus the identity of $\tau$ is $\beta$. The inverse of $\gamma$ is $\sigma$, and thus the inverse of $\sigma$ is $\gamma$. Thus, every element of this group has an inverse. So, it seems--unless I made a mistake--that these four conditions check out. My questions, then, are: (a) How does this look? (b) Is there an easier, more intuitive way to approach such a problem other than writing out the group table?","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'symmetric-groups']"

2850345,Limit of sum of independent simple functions,"Here is a question from a past homework which I was never able to solve.

Prove that either there is a countable set $A$ for which $P(S \in A) = 1$, or there is no $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ for which $P(S = \alpha) > 0$. My attempt was to suppose that there existed an $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ with $P(S = \alpha) > 0$, and then construct a countable set $A$ containing the support of $S$ using this $\alpha$. We have
\begin{align*}
P(S \text{ exists and is finite}) = 1,

so that
\begin{align*}
0 < P(S = \alpha) &\leq P\left(\sum_{i=2}^{\infty}X_i \in \bigcup_{x_1 \in F_1}\{\alpha- x_1\} \right) \\

  in Australia between 1970 and 1972 was 10%. There is reason to believe
  that working in a chemical plant for an extended period can increase your
  risk of lung cancer. Several Australian chemical plants were investigated,
  and it was found that of 90 deaths in working males aged 15-64, 19 were
  due to lung cancer. Is there evidence of increased risk of developing lung cancer if you work in
  a chemical plant? For this hypothesis test, we are required to provide a statement of the null and alternative hypothesis, a test statistic, the observed value and the estimated $p$-value. My Attempt: let $p$ be the probability of developing lung cancer in a chemical plant. Therefore, $$H_0:p=0.1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{vs} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ H_1:p>0.1$$
Our test statistic is
$$Z=\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{where} \ Z\sim N(0,1)$$
Our observed value is therefore
$$\frac{\frac{\hat{p}}{n}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} =\frac{\frac{19}{90}-0.1}{\sqrt{\frac{0.1(1-0.1)}{90}}}=3.51$$
Hence our p-value is 
$$\mathbb{P}(Z>\text{observed value})=\mathbb{P}(Z>3.51)<0.0001$$ Hence we reject $H_0$. Is my hypothesis test correct?","['statistics', 'probability', 'proof-verification', 'hypothesis-testing']"

2850477,Why is the interval topology defined not in terms of open rays but in terms of complements of closed rays?,"In the literature, 
see e.g. Frink (1942) or Erné (1980) ,
the interval topology on a partially ordered set $(X,\leq)$ is commonly defined as the topology generated by complements of closed rays.
A closed ray is a set $\{w\in X:w\leq x\}$ or $\{y\in X:y\geq x\}$, where $x\in X$. If $X$ is the set of real numbers then an equivalent but simpler definition of the interval topology is the topology generated by open rays, i.e., sets $\{w\in X:w < x\}$ or $\{y\in X:y > x\}$, where $x\in X$. But, while defining an open interval in terms of open rays is a simpler than defining it in terms of complements of closed rays, this apparently is not the preferred way to go. Apparently the topology generated by complements of closed rays is nicer to work with than the topology generated by open rays. Why is that?","['general-topology', 'order-theory']"

2850530,Only one group having $\mathbf{M}_3$ as its lattice of subgroups,"The problem. Consider the lattice $\mathbf{M}_3$ below Clearly, this is the lattice of subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$ (isomorphic to the Klein four-group $\mathbf{V}_4$), taking $A = \langle (0,1) \rangle$, $B = \langle (1,0) \rangle$ and $C = \langle (1,1) \rangle$. I want to show that, up to isomorphism, this is the only group $G$ having $\mathbf{M}_3$ as its lattice of subgroups. My solution. To start with, clearly $G$ is finite. In this case, since 
$$A \cap B = B \cap C = C \cap A = \{1\},$$
we have that
$$|AB| = |A|\cdot |B|, \quad |BC| = |B|\cdot|C|, \quad |CA|=|C|\cdot|A|,$$
and
$$|G| = (|A|-1) + (|B|-1) + (|C|-1) + 1 = |A|+|B|+|C|-2.$$
Since $A,B,C$ are minimal, they are cyclic of prime orders, $p_A, p_B, p_C$. First case. Suppose that $p_A, p_B, p_C$ are all different. As conjugate subgroups are isomorphic, it follows that $A,B,C \triangleleft G$, whence $AB, BC, CA \leq G$ and thus, in our specific case, $AB=BC=CA = G$, yielding
$$|G| = p_Ap_B = p_Bp_C = p_Cp_A,$$
whence $p_A=p_B=p_C$, a contradiction with the hypothesis. Second case. Suppose $p_A \neq p_B=p_C$. In this case $A \triangleleft G$, whence $AB, AC \leq G$ and $|G| = |A|\cdot|B| = p_Ap_B$. By the First Theorem of Sylow, $G$ has a Sylow $p_B$-subgroup $P$ of order $p_B$. Necessarily $P=B$ or $P=C$ and since $|B|=|C|$, they both are Sylow  $p_B$-subgroups of $G$ and $n_{p_B}=2$. By the Third Theorem of Sylow, $n_{p_B} | p_A$, whence $p_A=2$ and $|G|=2p_B$. 
So 
$$p_B^2 = |BC| \leq 2p_B,$$
whence $p_B \leq 2$ and thus, $p_A=p_B=p_C=2$, again, a contradiction. Third case. Suppose that $p_A=p_B=p_C=p$. If $q \neq p$ is another prime number dividing $|G|$, then $G$ has a Sylow $q$-subgroup, which is a contradiction because all proper non-trivial subgroups of $G$ have order $p$.
Hence
$$|G|=p^r,$$
for some $r>1$ (it can't be $r=1$ because $G$ has non-trivial proper subgroups).
$$r \geq 2 \quad\text{because}\quad p^2 = |AB| \leq |G|,$$
$$r \leq 3 \quad\text{because}\quad |G| \leq |A|\cdot |B|\cdot|C|.$$
Recall that, in this case, $|G|=3p-2$. If $|G|=p^3$, then
$$0 = p^3 -3p + 2 = (p+2)(p-1)^2,$$
whence $p=-2$, which is, of course, impossible; or $p=1$ which is not a prime (and $G$ would be trivial). Therefore $|G|=p^2$ and 
$$0 = p^2 - 3p + 2 = (p - 1)(p - 2),$$
yielding $p=2$, since, again, $G$ is not trivial. So $|A|=|B|=|C|=2$ and thus $G$ is an exponent $2$ group, whence abelian and having order $4$.
This is enough to fully determine $G$. My questions. I suspect that there is a much simpler proof, without going through all those cases and using elementary group theory (but I'm not claiming this one's advanced...). I would welcome a concise (and elementary) proof even if you don't want to take the time to read through all the above. Anyway, is this all right?

Since then weak and weak* convergence are the same on $X'$ and $Y'$, respectively: $Tx_n' \overset{*}{\rightharpoonup} Tx'$ in $Y$ $\Leftrightarrow Tx_n' \rightharpoonup Tx'$ in $Y'$ weakly. $x_n' \overset{*}{\rightharpoonup} x'$ in $X$ $\Leftrightarrow x_n' \rightharpoonup x'$ in $X'$ weakly Thus to prove the claim we prove that $Tx_n' \rightharpoonup Tx'$ in $Y'$ weakly:

If $f:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ continuous, $f\geq 0$, $\int_{a}^{b}f=0$ then $f=0$. My proof: Let's assume there exists some $c\in [a,b]$ such that $f(c)>0$. Then $f>0$ on an open set $c\in I\subset [a,b]$, this must be true because otherwise we would have a non-continuous piecewise function, $f(x)=0$ for all $x\in [a,b]-\{c\}$ and $f(c)=0$. Now let's build a lower Darboux sum greater than $0$. $L(f,\sigma)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} m_i(f)\,\Delta x_i=m_k(f)\,\Delta x_i>0,$ where my partition is $\sigma=\{ a=x_0<x_1<\dots<x_n=b \}$ picked in a way such that $[x_k,x_{k+1}]\subset I$.

However, here's my question: There's not much information about given about $f$, so I assume $f$ is a real valued function on $\mathbb{R}$. So clearly the composition $f(X)$ is also a random variable. The hypothesis that $f$ is continuous is never used. So, does it mean that $f$ does not have be continuous? Or am I wrong somewhere?",['statistics']
2852214,Is the topology of weak convergence of probability measures first-countable?,"Let $S$ be a separable metric space, and $\mu,\mu_1,\mu_2,\ldots$ be Borel probability measures on $S$.
We know that $\mu_n \to \mu$ weakly if and only if $\pi(\mu_n,\mu) \to 0$ where $\pi$ is the Prokhorov metric.
However, this (a priori) doesn't imply that the metric topology induced by $\pi$ is the same as the topology of weak convergence of probability measures (which is the smallest topology such that $\mu \mapsto \int f \,d\mu$ is continuous for all continuous bounded $f:S \to \mathbb{R}$), since the topology of weak convergence of probability measures might not be first-countable.
So my question is: is the topology of weak convergence of probability measures on $S$ first-countable?

My attempt: For $a\in A$ , let $U(a)=\{b\in A\mid a<b\}$ be the set of strictly upper bounds of $\{a\}$ in $A$ . Let $x=\min A$ and $s(a)=\min U(a)$ if $U(a)\neq\varnothing$ , and $s(a)=a$ otherwise. We define $f$ recursively as follows: $f(0)=x$ and $f(n+1)=s(f(n))$ . It's easy to prove that $f$ is increasing. Please check if the below part, in which I show $f$ is surjective, contains any error! Assume that $f$ is not surjective, then $P=\{b\in A\mid b\notin\text{ran}f\}\neq\varnothing$ . Let $p=\min P$ , then $p\neq x=f(0)$ . Let $p_0=\max\{b\in A\mid b<p\}$ , then $p_0\in\text{ran}f$ and $p_0=f(k)$ for some $k\in\mathbb N$ . So by definition of $f,f(k+1)=s(f(k))=s(p_0)=p$ . Thus $p\in\text{ran}f$ , which is a contradiction. So $f$ is surjective. EDIT: on the basis of Cameron Buie's answer, I added this part for clarity. $p_0$ is well-defined $p\neq x\implies x<p$ [Since $x=\min A$ ] $\implies x\in\{b\in A\mid b<p\}\implies\{b\in A\mid b<p\}\neq\varnothing$ . Also, each non-empty subset of $A$ has a least element and a greatest element, then $p_0=\max\{b\in A\mid b<p\}$ does exists. $s(p_0)=p$ We have $p_0=\max\{b\in A\mid b<p\}$ , then $p_0<p$ and $t<p\implies t\leq p_0$ . For all $k> p_0$ , then either $k<p$ (this case is impossible. If not, $k<p\implies k\leq p_0\implies k\not >p_0$ ) or $k\geq p$ . Thus $p_0<p$ and $p_0<k\implies p\leq k$ .

I am a bit confused with understanding the Bayesian analysis. Let consider the standard linear regression model with ""Gaussian noise"", i.e,

$$
\epsilon = y - f(\textbf{x}) = y - \textbf{x}^T\textbf{w} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_n^2)

and the p.d.f. of $\epsilon$ is 
$$
p_\epsilon(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_n}\exp\left(-\frac{z^2}{2\sigma_n^2}\right).

Therefore, given $\textbf{x}$ and $\textbf{w}$, the p.d.f. of $y$ would be
$$
p_{y\mid \textbf{x}, \textbf{w}}(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_n}\exp\left(-\frac{(z-\textbf{x}^T\textbf{w})^2}{2\sigma_n^2}\right).

It then follows from the Bayes' rule that
$$
p_{\textbf{w}\mid y, \textbf{x}}(w) = \frac{p_{y\mid \textbf{x},\textbf{w}}(z)\cdot p_{\textbf{w}}(w)}{p_{y\mid \textbf{x}}(z)}.
$$ Question: In the noise-free setup, how one can derive the posterior distribution $p_{\textbf{w}\mid y, \textbf{x}}(w)$?
It seems that in the noise-free setup, $y$ is completely determined by $\textbf{x}$ and $\textbf{w}$. Thus 
$$p_{y\mid \textbf{x},\textbf{w}}(z) = \delta_{\{z=\textbf{x}^T\textbf{w}\}}(z),
$$ a point distribution.
Then this gives
$$
p_{\textbf{w}\mid y, \textbf{x}}(w) = \frac{\delta_{\{z=\textbf{x}^T\textbf{w}\}}(z)}{P_{\textbf{w}}(\textbf{x}^T\textbf{w}=z \mid \textbf{x})}p_{\textbf{w}}(w) ?

(actually, not 100% sure about this). At this point, I don't see how the Bayeian approach is somehow useful in the noise-free senario. Or Is Bayeian approach based on the assumption of the presence of the noise? Any comments/answers/suggestions would be very appreciated.

2852846,Is probability determined by perspective?,"My question: is probability determined by perspective? The scenario that raised the question for me: Initial condition: The Monty Hall problem.  We know the contestant’s original choice of door #1 (of 3 total) is only correct 33% of the time.  After Monty Hall reveals door #3 is incorrect the contestant is asked if he would like to switch his answer to door #2.  We know he should choose to change his answer to the other unopened door (#2) which has a 66% chance of being correct.  He does so. However, let’s say once he decided to switch to door #2, and before either door is revealed, another contestant enters the room.  She does not have any knowledge of what has just transpired on stage.  She is offered a choice to pick which door the car behind of the 2 remains closed doors and also randomly chooses door #2. Are the probabilities of being correct different for each contestant?  Seemingly they are.  Contestant 1 had 3 doors to choose from, giving him a probability of 33% that door #1 is the answer.  Contestant 2 only had 2 doors to choose from, giving her a probability of 50% after choosing the same door contestant #1 choose.

matrix of rank $k<n$, with $\mathrm{col}(B)$ (the column space of $B$) not an
invariant subspace of $A$. We assume $A\neq0,I_n$. Consider $$f(a,b)=(I_{n}-aA)^{-1}Bb,$$ for real
scalar $a\in S$ and $b\in\mathbb{R}^k$. $S$ is the set of values of $a$ such that
$(I_{n}-aA)$ is invertible. We say that $f(a,b)$ identifies $a$ and $b$ over $\Omega$ if $f(a,b)=f(a^{\ast
},b^{\ast})$ implies $(a,b)=(a^{\ast},b^{\ast})$ for any two pairs
$(a,b),(a^{\ast},b^{\ast})\in\Omega$. The problem is to describe the set over which $f(a,b)$ does not identify $a$ and $b$. What I have done so far: Rewrite $f(a,b)=f(a^{\ast},b^{\ast})$ as
$$
B(b-b^{\ast})+AB(ab^{\ast}-a^{\ast}b)=0.\tag{1}\label{1}
$$
Thus, $f(a,b)$ identifies $a$ and $b$ over $\Omega$ if $\eqref{1}$ implies
$(a,b)=(a^{\ast},b^{\ast})$ for all $(a,b),(a^{\ast},b^{\ast})\in\Omega$. So far I understand only two particular cases: If $\mathrm{rank}(B,AB)=2k$, then $\eqref{1}$ is satisfied iff $b-b^{\ast}=0$ and
$ab^{\ast}-a^{\ast}b=0$, from which $(a,b)=(a^{\ast},b^{\ast})$ provided that
$b\neq0$. Hence, in this case $f(a,b)$ identifies $a$ and $b$ over
$S\times\mathbb{R}^{k}/\{0\}$. Partition $B$ as $(B_{1},B_{2})$ where $B_{1}$ is $n\times k_{1}$ and
$B_{2}$ is $n\times k_{2}$, with $0<k_{1}<k$, and suppose that $AB_{1}=B_{1}L$
for some $k_{1}\times k_{1}$ matrix $L$ ($\mathrm{col}(B_{1})$ is an invariant
subspace of $A$), and that $\mathrm{rank}(B,AB)=k+k_{2}.$ Then, letting
$\left(  b_{1}^{\prime},b_{2}^{\prime}\right)  $ be the partition of
$b^{\prime}$ conformable with that of $B,$ $\eqref{1}$ becomes
$$
B_{1}(b_{1}-b_{1}^{\ast}+L(ab_{1}^{\ast}-a^{\ast}b_{1}))+B_{2}(b_{2}%
-b_{2}^{\ast})+AB_{2}(ab_{2}^{\ast}-a^{\ast}b_{2})=0.
$$
Since the columns of $(B_{1},B_{2},AB_{2})$ are linearly independent,
$\eqref{1}$ is satisfied if and only if $b_{1}-b_{1}^{\ast}+L(ab_{1}^{\ast
}-a^{\ast}b_{1})=0$, $b_{2}-b_{2}^{\ast}=0$, and $ab_{2}^{\ast}-a^{\ast}%
b_{2}=0$. Combining the second and third equalities, gives $b_{2}=b_{2}^{\ast
}$ and $a=a^{\ast}$, provided that $b_{2}\neq0.$ Hence the first equality
becomes $\left(  I_{k_{1}}-aL\right)  \left(  b_{1}-b_{1}^{\ast}\right)  =0$,
which is equivalent to $b_{1}-b_{1}^{\ast}$ because $I_{k_{1}}-aL$ is
invertible for any $a\in S$. This means that $f(a,b)$ identifies $(a,b)$
provided that not all entries of $b$ associated to columns of $B$ not in
$\mathrm{col}(A)$ are zero (if they were we would essentially be in the
case when $\mathrm{col}(B)$ is an invariant subspace of $A$--in that case it is clear that
$\left(  a,b\right)  $ cannot be identified from $f(a,b)$) Update: Let's look at the case $k=2.$ Write $B=(B_{1},B_{2})$, so $B_1$ and $B_2$ are vectors. Assume
$\mathrm{rank}(B,AB)=\mathrm{rank}(B,AB_{2})=k+1$ (the case $\mathrm{rank}(B,AB)=2k$ is trivial, see case 1 above, and so is the case $\mathrm{rank}(B,AB)=k$), and write $$AB_{1}%
=l_{1}B_{1}+l_{2}B_{2}+l_{3}AB_{2},$$ for $l_{1},l_{2},l_{3}\in\mathbb{R}$.
From $\eqref{1}$,
\begin{equation}
\left[  \beta_{1}-\beta_{1}^{\ast}+l_{1}(a\beta_{1}^{\ast}-a^{\ast}\beta
_{1})\right]  B_{1}+\left[  \beta_{2}-\beta_{2}^{\ast}+l_{2}(a\beta_{1}^{\ast
}-a^{\ast}\beta_{1})\right]  B_{2}+\left[  a\beta_{2}^{\ast}-a^{\ast}\beta
_{2}+l_{3}(a\beta_{1}^{\ast}-a^{\ast}\beta_{1})\right]  AB_{2}=0.
\end{equation}
Since $\mathrm{rank}(B,AB_{2})=k+1,$ this equality is satisfied iff
$$\left\{
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%
b_{1}-b_{1}^{\ast}+l_{1}(ab_{1}^{\ast}-a^{\ast}b_{1})=0\\
b_{2}-b_{2}^{\ast}+l_{2}(ab_{1}^{\ast}-a^{\ast}b_{1})=0\\
ab_{2}^{\ast}-a^{\ast}b_{2}+l_{3}(ab_{1}^{\ast}-a^{\ast}b_{1})=0
\end{array}
\right.$$
As a linear system in the unknowns $b_{1}^{\ast},b_{2}^{\ast},a^{\ast}$, this
is
$$C\left[
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%

-l_{2}a & 1 & l_{2}b_{1}\\
-l_{3}a & a & l_{3}b_{1}+b_{2}%
\end{array}
\right]  .$$ If $\mathrm{rank}(C)=3$, the only solution to the system is $\left(  b^{\ast
},a^{\ast}\right)  =\left(  b,a\right)  $. If $\mathrm{rank}(C)<3$, there may
be other solutions. Note that
$$
\det(C)=\left(  l_{1}a-1\right)  b_{2}-\left(  l_{2}a+l_{3}\right)  b_{1}.
$$ Note that for fixed $a$, the set of $(b_1,b_2)$ such that $\det(C)=0$ is a line in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Incidentally note that case 2. above (with $k=2$) obtains when $l_{2}=l_{3}=0.$ In that case,
$\det(C)=\left(  l_{1}a-1\right)  b_{2}$, so $\det(C)=0$ only if $b_{2}=0$
($l_{1}a-1=0$ is impossible as $l_{1}$ must be an eigenvalue of $A$, so $l_{1}a-1=0$ would contradict invertibility of $(I_n-aA)$). That is,
in that case, we find again the result that $b,a$ is identifiable provided
that $b_{2}\neq0$.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'invariant-subspace']"
2852984,Does the expected value of the derivative of the log likelihood evaluated at a certain parameter always have negative mean?,"It is well known that the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the parameter of interest (the score) has zero expected value. Assuming $f(z;\theta)$ is a probability density function the quick version of the proof (skipping the technicalities in swapping the derivative and the integral) is $$\int \frac{\partial f(z;\theta)}{\partial \theta}dz=0 \Leftrightarrow \int \frac{f(z;\theta)}{f(z;\theta)} \frac{\partial f(z;\theta)}{\partial \theta}dz=0\Leftrightarrow \int f(z;\theta) \frac{\partial \log f(z;\theta)}{\partial \theta}dz=0$$ I was wondering if taking $\theta_1 > \theta$ the expected value of the score evaluated at $\theta_1$ $$\int f(z;\theta) \frac{\partial \log f(z;\theta_1)}{\partial \theta_1}dz$$ was always negative. I have tried this for the mean and variance of the normal distribution and for the parameter of the exponential distribution and it holds. Here is the derivation for the exponential: Assume $X \sim exp( \lambda)$.
Take $\lambda_1 > \lambda$
the derivative of the log likelihood of the exponential density with one observation is $$S(\lambda, x):=\frac{\partial }{ \partial \lambda} (\log(\lambda) - \lambda x) = \frac{1}{\lambda} - x$$ So
$$E[S(\lambda_1, X)] = E \left[  \frac{1}{\lambda_1} - X \right] = \frac{1}{\lambda_1} - \frac{1}{\lambda} < 0.$$ does this hold in general? EDIT: I was working on a proof only for the exponential family of distributions but couldn't quite make it, even a subcase like the exponential family would be interesting to me. EDIT2: after thinking about this for a while I think an equivalent way to state the problem is: ""when is the maximum likelihood estimator unbiased"".

2853178,"Question about this reduction to the ""universal elliptic curve""","My question arises from the reading of Katz & Mazur's book ""Arithmetic Moduli of Elliptic Curves"", which can be found here . Given an arbitrary scheme $S$, an elliptic curve over $S$ is a proper smooth curve $E/S$ with geometrically connected fibers all of genus $1$, together with a section $""0""$. By Abel's theorem, we know that such a curve comes with a commutative $S$-group-scheme structure. In theorem 2.3.1 (page 73 in the book, page 42 in the pdf), we would like to show the following statement about the behaviour of the ""multiplication by $N$"" homomorphism. Let $N\geq 1$ be an integer. Then the $S$-homomorphism ""multiplication by $N$"" $$[N]: E\rightarrow E$$ is finite locally free of rank $N^2$. If $N$ is invertible on $S$, its kernel $E[N]$ is finite étale over $S$, locally for the étale topology on $S$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. As for the proof of this theorem, we begin by a reduction argument ""to the universal case"", which is precisely what I don't understand. It is stated the following way. Zariski locally on $S$, $E$ is given by a smooth Weierstrass cubic in $\mathbb{P}^2_S$, with origin $(0,1,0)$, and any smooth Weierstrass cubic in $P^2_S$ is an elliptic curve over $S$ with origin $(0,1,0)$. So by reduction to the universal case, we may syppose that $S$ is the open set $U$ in $$\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6])$$ over which the cubic $$y^2+a_1xy+a_3y=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6$$ is smooth. I do not understand what the so-called ""universal case"" means and what role it plays... Are we trying to build a morphism $S\rightarrow \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6])$ identifying $S$ with $U$ and then considering the base change? Is it what is meant here? But as far as I can tell, if $E$ is described by a smooth cubic $$y^2+a_1xy+a_3y=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6$$ in $\mathbb{P}^2_S$ with coefficients $a_i\in \Gamma(S, \mathcal{O})$, the resulting map $S\rightarrow \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6])$ indeed has image in $U$, but does not identify $S$ with $U$... Could someone please provide some insights/explanations about this reduction argument here? I thank you very much for the clarifications.","['elliptic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"
2853190,How and when do principal homogeneous spaces form a group?,"Here's what I understand: Given a group $G$, a principal homogeneous space for $G$ consists of a set $X$ together with a free and transitive action of $G$ on $X$. Free in this context means that for all $x \in X$, the function $g \mapsto gx$ is injective. Transitive means that the aforementioned function is surjective. Principal homogeneous spaces for $G$ form a group, at least under certain assumptions. In algebraic geometry this is called Weil–Châtelet group . Perhaps it's obvious, but I can't see how such a group could be defined, and finding an elementary account of such things has proved difficult. Question. How is this group defined? What's the minimum assumptions on (and/or structure on $G$) necessary for this group to be defined?","['homogeneous-spaces', 'group-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
2853195,A natural isomorphism between the dual of k-th exterior power and the k-th exterior power of the dual?,"On the wikipedia page of Exterior Algebra under the section on alternating multilinear forms, it says: “... By the universal property of the exterior power, the space of alternating forms of degree $k$ on $V$ is naturally isomorphic with the dual vector space $\left( \Lambda^k V \right)^* $. If $V$ is finite-dimensional, then the latter is naturally isomorphic to $ \Lambda ^k \left(V^*\right) $. ...” I understand the first part, but I don’t see how the dual space of the $k$-th exterior power of $V$ is naturally isomorphic to the $k$-th exterior power of the dual of $V$? I get that they have the same dimension, but what’s the specific natural isomorphism?

2853214,Can all arbuzoids assume the same color?,"This puzzle is from a Russian web-site http://www.arbuz.uz/ and
there are many solutions to it, but mine uses linear algebra and is very naive.
There’s a planet inhabited by arbuzoids (watermeloners, to translate from Russian).
Those creatures are found in three colors: red, green and blue. There are 13 red
arbuzoids, 15 blue ones, and 17 green. When two differently colored arbuzoids
meet, they both change to the third color.
The question is, can it ever happen that all of them assume the same color? Edited: Apr 10, 2021, I just wanted to add that this is quoted from Jim Hefferon, Linear Algebra . I still have no idea how this problem carved its way into my Linear Algebra book, but I gave it a go. Strangely, I didn't realize the relationship this had with Linear Algebra,  so I decided to formalize it. let $S$ be a set such that: $\langle 13, 17, 15\rangle \in S $ $\forall r,g,b,a \in \mathbb N ( \langle r,g,b\rangle\in S \to ($ $[(a \leq r \land a\leq g) \to \langle r-a,g-a,b+2a\rangle \in S] \land$ $\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\space[(a \leq r \land a\leq b) \to \langle r-a,g+2a,b-a\rangle \in S] \land$ $\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\space[(a \leq g \land a\leq b) \to \langle r+2a,g-a,b-a\rangle \in S] \space ))$ We have to show that: $\exists a \in \mathbb N(\langle a,0,0 \rangle\in S \lor \langle 0,a,0 \rangle\in S \lor \langle 0,0,a \rangle\in S) \tag{I}$ or.. $\not\exists a \in \mathbb N(\langle a,0,0 \rangle\in S \lor \langle 0,a,0 \rangle\in S \lor \langle 0,0,a \rangle\in S) \tag{II}$ I don't know how this is at all related to Linear Algebra, and I barely know anything about set theory, so bye. What I did I started from the first element in $S$ , as shown. First start with the element. remember, the order is red, green, blue: $\langle 13,17,15 \rangle \in S \tag{0}$ Eliminate the red arbuzoids: $\langle 0,43,2 \rangle \in S \tag{1}$ combine $1$ green with $1$ blue: $\langle 2,42,1 \rangle \in S \tag{2}$ Note that if the blue arbuzoids in $(1)$ were $3$ , the problem would have been solved.Also, If they had been any multiple of 3 less than or equal to green,  the problem would have been solved, since you'll combine 1 third of blue with green, and then red and blue would be equal, then you combine them, and get all green. Anyway,the  blue arbuzoids were not 3. I did many failed steps, noting a few things, and I couldn't get anything. I decided to write some code to test(i.e brute force the combinations and find) whether it's possible, starting from (2), but it failed to reach anything. Can you prove $(I)$ , or $(II)$ ?","['puzzle', 'linear-algebra', 'elementary-set-theory']"

2853324,Smooth quartic surface in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$ that contains a smooth curve of genus 2 and degree 6.,"I am reading through an article by Matsumura and Monsky on Automorphisms of Hypersurfaces in which they state that there exist quartic surfaces is $\mathbb{P}^{3}$ which have infinite automorphism groups, this is Theorem 4 in the linked article. They construct an example of such a surface but it is not explicit, they say; ""Let $F$ be a non-singular (smooth) quartic surface in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$ containing a non-singular curve $C$ of genus 2 and of degree 6."" I was wondering if there was an explicit formula for such a surface? I have read around and found that a possible construction of a non-singular qaurtic surface in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$ is to take the intersection of 2 quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^{4}$ , and also a construction of a non-singular curve of genus 2 and degree 6 is to take a polynomial $f(x)$ in one variable with 6 distinct roots and then consider the hyper-elliptic curve $y^{2}=f(x)$ . However I do not know how to combine these two constructions together to give the surface I am looking for. Finally they say that the result is classical and cite 3 articles claiming they contain other examples/constructions, one due to G. Fano ( Sopra alcune superficie del 4 ordine rappresentabili sal piano doppio (1906) ), and two due to F. Severi ( Complementi alla teoria della base per la totalita delle curve di una superficie algebric (1910) , and Geometria dei sistemi algebrici (1958) ) all of which are very old and also in Italian. I cannot get a hold of any of the three articles (nor can I read Italian), so these do not provide much help. Any help about a possible construction or a pointer to an article that isn't in Italian would be greatly appreciated.
