11214,Is there a continuous Taylor/MacLaurin transform (like the Fourier transform)?,"My consideration might be total nonsense (as a high school student, I lack the mathematical knowledge to really check my idea), but I was just wondering whether one could find a continuous generalization of the Taylor series comparable to the continuous Fourier transform. Just like the Fourier transform decomposes a function $f(t)$ into a sum of trigonometric functions with a result $\hat{f}(\omega)=\mathcal{F}(f)(\omega)$ with the domain of frequencies , could one define a Taylor transform $\mathcal{T}(f)$ that would operate on $n$th derivatives? Instead of the trigonometric functions in Fourier transform, $f$ would be decomposed into a sum of polynomials of form $\frac{1}{n!}x^n$. So is it a valid operation to generalize the Taylor series for continuous values of $n$ (i.e. using integrals instead of sums)? My naive approach would be $$f(t) = \intop_0^{\infty} \mathcal{T}(f)(n)\cdot \frac{t^n}{\Gamma(n+1)} \mathrm{d}n$$ So in fact, the transform would define (or at least require) non-integer derivatives of a function. Do these exist (like a non-integer iterates of functions can be defined too)? Example:
Assuming that $\frac{\mathrm{d}^ne^x}{\mathrm{d}x^n}(0) = 1$ for any $x\in \mathbb{R}$, I'd come up with $$e^t = \intop_0^{\infty} \frac{t^n}{\Gamma(n+1)} \mathrm{d}n$$ as a continuous version of $$e^t = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{t^n}{n!}$$ Thus $$\mathcal{T}(e^t)(n) = 1,\,n\in\mathbb{R}$$ Is a transform like I explained possible or - in case it is - even somehow useful?","['calculus', 'analysis']"

11231,"Probability in single-lane traffic flow: What are the odds of ""choke points"" being encountered?","Let's say you have a single-lane road (single in this case meaning single lane in each direction, or what you could also call two-lane). Let's say you have a random number of vehicles on a given 10-mile stretch of road. The speed limit is 45 mph, but some people go faster and some go slower. Is there any math that describes the likelihood that faster vehicles will overtake slower vehicles at ""choke points"" (points where oncoming traffic makes passing impossible)? (Assume a straight, flat road where safe passing is always allowed.) EDIT: Choke points are points where oncoming cars make it impossible to pass without the overtaking vehicle having to slow down and wait for the oncoming car (or cars) to pass. Obviously, the answer has to be some kind of curve, because if there is only one vehicle on the road the probability is 0 that a choke point will be encountered, and if the road is completely filled with vehicles in both directions (or even one) the probability is 1 that a choke point will be encountered at any given time. Sorry if this is a stupid question. But it seems like there should be a way to express this mathematically. EDIT 2: Limiting the scope of the problem Thanks to Mike Spivey, and I hope this helps narrow the problem so that may be in some way answerable. If not, I'll just declare defeat and retire from the field. Let's say that we have two cars going in one direction: a slow vehicle (Vehicle A) traveling at 30mph and a faster vehicle (Vehicle B) traveling at 60mph. At the start of the problem the A is somewhere between mile 2 and mile 4 on the 10-mile road, and B is at mile 0. Additionally, there will be four oncoming vehicles randomly distributed, and these vehicles are randomly traveling at 30 or 60mph. The overtaking vehicle requires .5 miles of ""clear"" space to pass safely if the oncoming vehicle is traveling at 60mph, and .25 if it is traveling at 30mph. Assume further that the car lengths do not matter, but that a ""choke point"" (or bottleneck, if you prefer) is not reached until B gets within .05 miles of the rear bumper of A, at which point B has to pass A or decelerate. We will call the latter condition a ""deceleration event,"" (DE) and I would like to be able to calculate the probability that at least one DE will occur for Vehicle A along the 10-mile route. Perhaps this clarification is still insufficient to render the problem solvable, but I appreciate anyone taking the time to consider it.","['probability', 'mathematical-modeling']"

11244,Continuity of Rational Functions on the Riemann Sphere $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$,"Let $\hat{\mathbb{C}} = \mathbb{C} \cup \{ \infty \}$ denote the Riemann Sphere . While reading the wikipedia article about it I found a passage that said that every rational function on the complex plane can be extended to a continuous function on the Riemann Sphere . The particular construction is as follows, let $R(z) = \frac{f(z)}{g(z)} \in \mathbb{C}(z)$ be a rational function. Lets assume for simplicity that $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ share no common factor. Then for any point $a \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $g(a) = 0$ but $f(a) \neq 0$ we define $R(a) = \infty$. Also we define $R(\infty) := \lim_{z \to \infty} R(z)$. So to quote wikipedia, with this definitions $R(z)$ becomes a continuous function from the Riemann Sphere to itself. The problem for me is that the article doesn't add any details as to how one may go about showing that in fact $R(z)$ is continuous. So my question is exactly that, to make it simple, if I have for instance $R(z) = \frac{z-1}{z+1}$ or even $R(z) = \frac{1}{z}$, how do I show that it is a continuous function on $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$? I think I can build up from an easy example such as this (assumming this is easy). Also, I'm a little bit confused about how to interpret this continuity, how should I see the continuity on the Riemann Sphere?, does it involve an argument with stereographic projection? I added in the Riemann Surface tag just in case they are involved, which I'm not sure. Thank you very much in advance.","['riemann-surfaces', 'complex-analysis']"

squares. Proof. If $p=4k+1$ there are $x<p$ such that $p\mid (x^{2}+1)$ , then $p\mid(x+\imath)(x-\imath)$ . Note that, if $p\mid (x+\imath)$ , there are $(a+b\imath)$ such that: $$(x+\imath)=p(a+b\imath)=pa+pb\imath.$$ This implies that $x=pa$ , this is imposible as $x\lt p$ . Therefore $p\nmid(x+\imath)$ , also $p\nmid(x-\imath)$ . Then $p$ is not an Gaussian prime, so $p = \alpha \beta$ with $\mathrm{N}(\alpha)\gt 1$ and $\mathrm{N}(\beta)\gt 1$ . If $ \alpha=a+b\imath $ and $\beta=c+d\imath$ , we get: $$\mathrm{N}(p)=\mathrm{N}(\alpha \beta)=\mathrm{N}\alpha\cdot\mathrm{N}\beta,$$ which implies: $$p^{2}=(a^{2}+b^{2})(c^{2}+d^{2}).$$ Note that the last equation is an integer, so $(a^{2}+b^{2})|p^{2}$ . By this last equation $(a^{2}+b^{2}),(c^{2}+d^{2})\neq 1,$ so therefore: $$p=a^{2}+b^{2}$$ ** It's beautiful!  Does anyone have other

11304,why does a certain formula in Lang's book on modular forms hold?,"Background: Let $k$ be an even integer. The Eisenstein series are defined by $$E_{k} =  1 - \frac{2k}{B_{k}}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sigma_{k-1}(n)q^{n}$$ where 
$$\sigma_{k-1}(n)= \sum\limits_{d \mid n,\;d \geq 1} d^{k-1}$$ and $B_{k}$ is the $k$-th Bernoulli number. If $k \gt 2$ then $E_{k}$ is a modular form of weight $k$. In the case when $k = 2$, $E_{k}$ is not a modular form. Let $P = E_{2}$. Thus $P = 1 - 24\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \sigma_{1}(n)q^{n}$. Let $\theta$ be the differential operator defined by $\theta = q \frac{d}{dq}$. If $f$ is a modular form of weight $k$, define $\Delta f = 12 \theta f - kPf$.

11315,Is there formal name and proof for this formula/theorem (for now I'm calling it Orbital Collinearity Theorem)?,"Suppose you are given a question that goes like this: Consider three planets that revolve
  around a star on separate circular
  orbits sharing the same orbital plane.
  The first planet, A, takes 385 days to
  complete its orbit. The second planet,
  B, takes 814 days, while the third
  planet, C, takes 1672 days. Suppose,
  at one moment in time, the three
  planets and their star are in one
  straight line among each other (i.e.
  they are collinear). Calculate how
  many days the star and planets will be
  collinear again. It looks like a simple question. Obvious enough, there are at least two trivial solutions for this kind of question. The first is the linear product of all the figures: 385 x 814 x 1672 = 523988080 days, while the second is their Least Common Multiple (LCM): LCM(385, 814, 1672) = 2165240 days. But surprisingly, it just takes $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days for the planets to be collinear again, albeit not at the same location. The question does not restrict the answer to be an integer, after all. My ""Orbital Collinearity Theorem"" :P By trial and error, I found out that the number of days for the planets to become collinear again can be calculated by the formula: $\dfrac{LCM(d_1, d_2, ... , d_n)}{M}$ where LCM(…) denotes Least Common Multiple and M is the largest integer for which the following modular congruence holds: $\frac{d_1}{G} \equiv \frac{d_2}{G} \equiv ... \equiv \frac{d_n}{G} \pmod{M}$ where G is the Greatest Common Divisor of the numbers of days the planets take to complete their respective orbits ($d_1$, $d_2$, ... , $d_n$). In other words, M is the largest integer that can give the same remainder when it divides each of $\frac{d_1}{G}$, $\frac{d_2}{G}$, ... , $\frac{d_n}{G}$. If there is no such M that is larger than 1 (since all integers will give remainder of 0 when divided by 1), the answer will be the LCM, which is very much expected. For 385, 814 and 1672, the value of M is 39: $GCD(385, 814, 1672) = 11$ $\frac{385}{11}=35$ and $35 \bmod 39 = 35$ $\frac{814}{11}=74$ and $74 \bmod 39 = 35$ $\frac{1672}{11}=152$ and $152 \bmod 39 = 35$ I don’t really have the proof/working since it is trial and error, but so far after testing with many samples the formula seems to hold for each case. So let’s check if after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, the three planets are collinear or not: Planet A: if it takes 385 days to complete its orbit, after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, it has traveled $\frac{2165240}{39} \cdot \frac{1}{385}=144 \frac{3080}{15015} = 144 \frac{8}{39}$ cycles Planet B: if it takes 814 days to complete its orbit, after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, it has traveled $\frac{2165240}{39} \cdot \frac{1}{814}=68 \frac{6512}{31746} = 68 \frac{8}{39}$ cycles Planet C: if it takes 1672 days to complete its orbit, after $\frac{2165240}{39}$ days, it has traveled $\frac{2165240}{39} \cdot \frac{1}{1672}=33 \frac{13376}{65208} = 33 \frac{8}{39}$ cycles It should be obvious that the numbers of cycles that the three planets have gone have the same fractional part, which is $\frac{8}{39}$. Meaning that they are all $\frac{8}{39}$ cycle into their current cycle (34th, 69th and 145th). Hence they all form the same angle from their last collinear position, thus they are collinear. Second sample: minute and hour hands The minute and hour hands overlap at
  12 o’clock. At what time will the
  hands overlap again? By considering the hands as planets revolving around the clock center, we can use the formula to solve it. First consider that minute hand takes 60 minutes to complete a cycle, while hour hand takes 720 minutes. LCM(60,720) = 720 and GCD(60, 720) = 60. That will give us M = 11. Thus it will take $\frac{720}{11} = 65.454545454545454545454545454545$ minutes for them to overlap again. And translating that into time gives us 1:05 and 27.27272727272 seconds. Correct. Moreover, this sample is an example of why we must divide the numbers by their GCD to get the M, a step that was not significant with the three planets question; because if we didn’t, M would be 60, giving us 12 minute as the answer. So, my real question is: Is there official name and proof for this formula/theorem? p/s: forgive the inappropriate tags since I don't have enough points to add new tags and there are no suitable tags among the existing ones. EDIT: OK, I've worked out the proof half-way but I still can't connect it to the last piece. I'm appending the half-proof here with hope that any of you guys can help me complete it: Let $L = LCM(d_1, d_2, ... , d_n)$. Then it's a given that L is the least number of days for the planets to be collinear again at the same position (i.e. all of them have revolves $c_1, c_2, ... , c_n$ integral number of cycles around the star). Proof by contradiction: suppose there exists another number $K < L$ for which the planets are collinear at the same position, then L must be a common multiple of $d_1, d_2, ... , d_n$, but $L$ is the least of their common multiples, hence contradiction. Yet, we still have a possibility that L could be the M-th time the planets are collinear regardless of position. If such $M > 1$ exists, then the number of cycles that the planets have undergone after L days, $c_1, c_2, ... , c_n$, should have the same remainder if divided by M. Therefore, the following modular congruence must hold: $\frac{L}{d_1} \equiv \frac{L}{d_2} \equiv ... \equiv \frac{L}{d_n} \pmod{M}$ That's where I am now. I'm trying to connect the above congruence to: $\frac{d_1}{G} \equiv \frac{d_2}{G} \equiv ... \equiv \frac{d_n}{G} \pmod{M}$ It's trivial to do so with $d_1$ and $d_2$ only because $LCM(d_1,d_2)GCD(d_1,d_2) = d_1d_2$ but the relationship between LCM and GCD becomes less simplistic for more than two numbers. The simplest I could find is $\displaystyle a_1 ... a_n = GCD(a_1, a_2, ... a_n) LCM \left( \frac{a_1 ... a_n}{a_1}, \frac{a_1 ... a_n}{a_2}, ... \frac{a_1 ... a_n}{a_n} \right)$ ( from another question in Math SE ) but it cannot be used directly in the formula because the GCD and LCM terms are different.

11321,How does the Chinese Remainder Theorem behave with polynomials with multiple variables?,"I'm interested because I want to show that $x^2-34y^2\equiv -1\pmod{m}$ has solutions for all integers $m$. I started by using the following reasoning: If $3\nmid m$, then $gcd(m,3)=1$. Then there exists a multiplicative inverse $\bar{3}$ modulo $m$. I note that $5^2-34=-(3^2)$, and thus $\bar{3}^2(5^2-34)\equiv (\bar{3}\cdot 5)^2-34(\bar{3}^2)\equiv -(\bar{3})^2(3^2) \equiv -1\pmod{4}$. And thus $(\bar{3}\cdot 5, \bar{3})$ is a solution modulo $m$. Similarly, if $5\nmid m$, then $(m,5)=1$. Then since $3^2-34=-(5^2)$, then I also have $\bar{5}^2(3^2-34)\equiv (\bar{5}\cdot 3)^2-34(\bar{5}^2)\equiv -(\bar{5})^2(5^2)\equiv -1\pmod{m}$. So for any $m$ not divisible by $3$ or $5$, there exists a solution. Then for $m$ such that $3|m$ and $5|m$, then $m$ has prime factorization $m=3^a5^b{p_1}^{q_1}\cdots {p_r}^{q_r}$. This would give the system of congruences $x^2-34y^2 \equiv -1 \pmod{3^a},
x^2-34y^2 \equiv -1 \pmod{5^b},
x^2-34y^2 \equiv -1 \pmod{{p_i}^{q_i}}$ Then $5\nmid 3^a$, $3\nmid 5^b$, and $3\nmid {p_i}^{q_i}$ and $5\nmid {p_i}^{q_i}$, so each of the congruences has a solution. Does the Chinese Remainder Theorem then imply that there is a solution modulo $m$? I know that it holds for polynomials in one variable $x$, and that the number of solutions is the product of the number of solutions for each prime power modulus. Would the same result hold now that there are two variables in the polynomial? I haven't found any proofs to support or contradict the result. Thanks!","['modular-arithmetic', 'number-theory']"

Without loss of generality, we can assume that the vectors $u$ and $v$ have unit norm. I am not sure that the following notation is standard, but I assume that the vector $u$ is defined with $\rho = 1$ and the angular components $\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_{d-1}$. We can obtain the Euclidean components as follows: $$u_{x_1} = \cos \theta_1$$ $$u_{x_2} = \sin \theta_1 \cos \theta_2$$ $$\ldots$$ $$u_{x_{d-1}} = \sin \theta_1 \ldots \sin \theta_{d-2} \cos \theta_{d-1}$$ $$u_{x_d} = \sin \theta_1 \ldots \sin \theta_{d-2} \sin \theta_{d-1}.$$ One way to find the angle is to represent the two vectors in the Euclidean coordinates and compute arccos of the dot product.

11359,Compactification of Manifolds,"It is known that for any locally compact Hausdorff space X, we can define a Hausdorff one-point compactification containing X.
In the case of the (differentiable) manifold $\mathbb R^n$ this one-point compactification turns out to be (homeomorphic to) $\mathbb S^n$, which is again a (differentiable) manifold. This leads to the following question: What does the picture look like in the general case for compactifications of an arbitrary manifold $M$? Although the one-point compactification of $M$ is not a manifold in general (e.g. $\mathbb R^n - 0$); is it possible to view every manifold as an open (dense?) subset of a compact manifold by taking some other kind of compactification?
In the differentiable case? In the $C^0$-case? I had thought along the following lines at first:
By the Whitney embedding theorem, every manifold $M$ can be thought of as a closed submanifold of $\mathbb R^n$ for some $n$. And by embedding $\mathbb R^n$ into $\mathbb S^n$, we can think of $M$ as an embedded submanifold of a compact manifold. 
But I guess taking the closure of $M$ in $\mathbb S^n$ will not in general leave us with a manifold anymore (?), so this does not answer my question... Has this been looked into? Thanks for any thoughts. S.L.","['general-topology', 'differential-topology']"

I understand that a polynomial is basically a set of numbers (or, if you'd rather, a mapping of one set of numbers to another), or, in another way of thinking about it, two polynomials are functions, and the product of the two functions is a new function that lets you apply the function once, provided you were planning on applying the original functions to the number and then multiplying the result together.

11465,Computing the Chern-Simons invariant of $SO(3)$,"I am an undergraduate learning about gauge theory and I have been tasked with working through the two examples given on pages 65 and 66 of "" Characteristic forms and geometric invariants "" by Chern and Simon. I will recount the examples and my progress at a solution. For ease here is the relevant text: Example 1. Let $M = \mathbb{R}P^3 = SO(3)$ together with the standard metric of constant curvature 1. Let $E_1, E_2, E_3$ be an orthonormal basis of left invariant fields on $M$, oriented positively. Then it is easily seen that $\nabla_{E_1}E_2 = E_3, \nabla_{E_1}E_3 = - E_2, \text{ and } \nabla_{E_2}E_3 = E_1$. Let $\chi : M \rightarrow F(M)$ be the cross-section determined by this frame.
  $$\Phi(SO(3)) = \frac{1}{2}.$$ Example 2. Again let $M = SO(3)$, but this time with left invariant metric $g_{\lambda}$, with respect to which $\lambda E_1, E_2, E_3$ is an orthonormal frame. Direct calculation shows
  $$\Phi(SO(3),g_{\lambda}) = \frac{2\lambda^2 - 1}{2\lambda^4}.$$ For each of these examples I am expected to calculate $$\Phi(M) = \int_{\chi(M)} \frac{1}{2} TP_1(\theta)$$
which lies in $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. Previously in the paper they give an explicit formulation of $TP_1(\theta)$ in terms of the ""component"" forms of the connection $\theta$ and its curvature $\Omega$,
$$TP_1(\theta) = \frac{1}{4\pi^2}\left( \theta_{12}\wedge\theta_{13}\wedge\theta_{23} + \theta_{12}\wedge\Omega_{12} + \theta_{13}\wedge\Omega_{13} + \theta_{23}\wedge\Omega_{23}\right).$$ I have verified this formula for myself given the information in the paper. Using the structural equation $\Omega = d\theta + \theta\wedge\theta$ I am able to reduce the expression for $TP_1(\theta)$ to
$$TP_1(\theta) = \frac{-1}{2\pi^2}\left( \theta_{12}\wedge\theta_{13}\wedge\theta_{23} \right).$$ I don't believe I have assumed anything about the structure of $M$ during that reduction so I believe it should hold for both examples. I continue by claiming that since $E_1, E_2, E_3 \in so(3)$, the Lie algebra of $SO(3)$ I should be able to compute $\theta$ by considering
$$\nabla_{E_i}E_j := (\nabla E_j)(E_i) = \sum_k E_k \otimes \theta^{k}{}_{ij}(E_i)$$
and comparing it with the given derivatives. For example one this yielded for me $\theta_{12} = E^3, \theta_{13} = -E^2, \theta_{23} = E^1$ where $E^i$ are the 1-forms dual to the basis $E_i$. Then I think that $\chi^*$ should act trivially on $TP_1(\theta)$ as it is a horizontal form in $\Lambda^*(T^*F(M))$. Therefore I find that $\chi^*(TP_1(\theta)) = \frac{1}{2\pi^2}\omega$, where $\omega$ is the volume form of $M$, and when integrated this yields the correct answer of $\frac{1}{2}$ for the first example. However, my approach fails completely for the second example. I assume that the set $\lambda E_1, E_2, E_3$ obeys the same derivate relationships as given in the first example, but this does not seem to give me enough factors of $\lambda$. I suspect that I am not handling the computation of the $\theta_{ij}$ forms or the application of $\chi^*$ correctly, however I am uncertain what my exact issue is. Is there a fundamental flaw in my understanding? I am hoping someone with more experience can point me in the right direction.",['differential-geometry']

Those being symmetry, scaling and distributivity as the dot product properties and the norm of a vector being the squared root of the dot product between the same vector. I was thinking about using the fact that if a vector is perpendicular to another vector the dot product between those vectors should be 0. But that is not provided as a hint so I'm not sure.

To me they have a beauty of their own. They can be deep or not. As an example, imagine you have a series of numbers such that if you add 1 to any number you will get the product of its left and right neighbors. Then this series will repeat itself at every fifth step! For instance, if you start with 3, 4 then the sequence continues: 3, 4, 5/3, 2/3, 1, 3, 4, 5/3, etc. The difference between a mathematician and a nonmathematician is not just being able to discover something like this, but to care about it and to be curious about why it's true, what it means, and what other things in mathematics it might be connected with. In this particular case, the statement itself turns out to be connected with a myriad of deep topics in advanced mathematics: hyperbolic geometry, algebraic K-theory, the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics, and certain models of quantum field theory. I find this kind of connection between very elementary and very deep mathematics overwhelmingly beautiful."" The recursion described here is a(n+1)=(1+a(n))/a(n-1) with a(0)=1, a(1)=3.
It's fairly straightforward to show that for every positive a(0),a(1) the sequence repeats after 5 steps (and a(0)=a(1)=golden ratio is a fixed point). One can also think of this recursion as the planar map f(x,y)=((1+x)/y,x), and every point in the plane is a period-5 point of this map.

11908,Derivative of an expectation (using integrals),"I am working through an economics paper and I need to take the derivative of the following function: $h\left(\overline{\omega}\right) = \int^{\infty}_{\overline{\omega}} \omega \Phi \left(d\omega\right)$ Even though I don't understand it well, I can do the derivative for the case $g\left(\overline{\omega}\right) = \int^{\overline{\omega}}_{0} \omega \Phi \left(d\omega\right)$ where the derivative is simply $g'\left(\overline{\omega}\right) = \overline{\omega} \phi \left(\overline{\omega}\right)$ But for $h\left(\overline{\omega}\right)$ where the upper bound is $\infty$ I really have no idea of what to do.

11941,"Evaluation of the limit, $\lim \limits_{x\rightarrow\infty} \left(\frac{20x}{20x+4}\right)^{8x}$, using only elementary methods","I was assisting a TA for an introductory calculus class with the following limit, $$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{20x}{20x+4}\right)^{8x}$$ and I came to simple solution which involved evaluating the ""reciprocal"" limit $$\lim_{z \rightarrow 0} \left(\frac{1}{1+\frac{z}{5}}\right)^{8/z}$$ by using the Taylor expansion of $\log(1+z)$ around $z=0$. However, the TA claims that the students have not learned about series expansions so that would not be a valid solution for the course. I tried applying L'Hopital's rule, which I was told the class did cover, but I was unsuccessful. As a note I will mention that $$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{20x}{20x+4}\right)^{8x} = e^{-8/5}.$$ Any ideas for a solution to this problem using only knowledge from a first quarter (or semester) calculus course which hasn't covered series expansions?",['calculus']

11958,What is the standard method to estimate probabilities of events based on observations?,"I start from a simple example. I through a (possibly unfair) coin 20 times. I got ""eagle"" and ""tail"" 15 and 5 times, respectively. Now I need to estimate probabilities for eagle and tail. For eagle I get 15/20 = 0.75 and for the tail I get 0.25. However, I know that the probability that I got are not accurate. It is still possible that I have a fair coin (with probability for eagle equal to 0.5) and I get more eagles in my experiment just by chance. Now I want to estimate probabilities of probabilities. In other words I want to know how likely it is that probability for eagle is 0.5 (or 0.3, or 0.9). I can solve this problem, but I would like to know if there is a name for this problem. I an also interested in the generalization of the problem for the case of more than two events (not just ""eagle"" and ""tail"").","['statistics', 'probability']"
11968,Cyclic sylow subgroup of order 9 with 3-core of order 3,"Can a finite group G have a cyclic Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9, such that the intersection of the Sylow 3-subgroups of G has order exactly 3, without having non-identity normal subgroups of order coprime to 3? In classifying the finite groups with cyclic Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9, it seems reasonable to split into cases based on the size of the 3-core (the intersection of the Sylow 3-subgroups) mod the 3'-core (the largest normal subgroup of order coprime to 3).  3-Cores of sizes 1 and 9 are easy to handle, but size 3 is devolving into a number of cases none of which seem to work, but for no systematic reason. Is there some systematic reason it cannot occur, or is there an example I've overlooked? Edit: The original left out the important condition on normal subgroups of order coprime to 3, without which the classification is intractable.  Alex's answer shows how to use such normal subgroups to get fairly arbitrary behavior (for any type of Sylow). Edit 2: If the perfect residuum X of the group is nontrivial, it contains Ω(P) of the cyclic Sylow p-subgroup P, and so O p (G) ≤ O p (X).  In this case, O p (X) = 1.  Hence the group is solvable, and Fit(G) = O p (G), so G/Fit(G) ≤ Aut(p) = p−1 has the wrong order.",['group-theory']
