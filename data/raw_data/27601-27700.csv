255274,Are normal subgroups transitive?,"Suppose $G$ is a group and $K\lhd H\lhd G$ are normal subgroups of $G$. Is $K$ a normal subgroup of $G$, i.e. $K\lhd G$? If not, what extra conditions on $G$ or $H$ make this possible? Applying the definitions, we know $\{ghg^{-1}\mid h\in H\}=H$ and $\{hkh^{-1}\mid k\in K\}=K$, and want $\{gkg^{-1}\mid k\in K\}=K$. Clearly, the best avenue for a counterexample is if $gkg^{-1}\not\in K$ for some $k\in K$ and $g\in G-H$.

255464,What Mathematics questions can be better solved with concepts from Physics?,"Over the years, I've seen several questions in mathematics that can be solved using concepts borrowed from Physics. Having seen these question, I'm interested to find out what other mathematics questions you've found that can be better solved with a concept from physics - or at least where the application of physics is interesting and perhaps illuminating. Examples One of these questions is on minimizing the time taken for a lifeguard to go out to a stationary distressed swimmer. In the scenario, the lifeguard runs faster than he swims in the water, and as such the straight line is not the fastest way for the lifeguard to reach the swimmer. Students will normally use calculus to solve this problem, and the answer can be obtained after some work - however, a much more convenient (and intuitive) way is to borrow from the idea of refractive indices in geometric optics. We recast the situation by replacing the beach and the sea with two materials with different refractive indices, choosing the appropriate refractive indices proportionate to the ratio between the lifeguard's velocities while running and swimming. The problem is then reduced to finding a beam of light that passes through both the swimmer and the lifeguard's position. (For a more complete explanation, you can visit this site: http://findingmoonshine.blogspot.sg/2012_05_01_archive.html ) Another of these questions requires one to prove that, in an acute-angled triangle, the angle subtended by any side of the triangle at the Toricelli point is 120°. Again, instead of using trigonometry, one can use the concept of hanging equal weights from a (frictionless) string at each of the vertices of the triangle, and then tying each of the three strings together at one knot placed on the surface of the triangle. The equilibrium position of the knot is the Toricelli point, and one can then complete the proof by considering forces acting on the knot.

255468,Differentiability and extrema - counterexamples for a few statements,"All the following statement are wrong. Give a counterexample $f:(-1,1)\to\mathbb{R}$ for each statement and explain why your function $f$ contradicts with the statement. If $f'(x)$ exists for all $x\neq 0$ and $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}f'(x)$ exists too, then $f$ is differentiable at $x=0$. If $f$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ and therefore $f'(0)= 0$ is false then $f$ has no local extremum at $x=0$. If $f$ is continuously differentiable in $(-1,1)$ and $f'(0)=0$ then $x=0$ is a local extremum of $f$. If $f$ is continuously differentiable in $(-1,1)$ and $x=0$ is a local maximum then $f''(0)$ exists and $f''(0)<0$. If $f$ is differentiable and strictly monotonically increasing then $f'(x)>0$. $f(x)=|x|$ was my first thought, but $f'(x)=1$ for $x>0$ and $f'(x)=-1$ for $x<0$ and i am unsure whether the limit for $x\to 0$ actually exists. Let $f(x)=|x|$ then $f$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ however $x=0$ is a local minimum. Let $f(x)=x^3$ then $f''(0)=0$ and $f$ has therefore no local extremum at $x=0$. Let $f(x)=-x^4$ then $f''(x)=-12x^2$ and $f''(0)=0$. Let $f(x)=x^3$ yields $f'(x)=3x^2$ and with $x=0$ we get $f'(0)=0$.

255476,A variant of assignment problem (different sizes of sets),"I'm given objects divided into two disjoint sets, $A$ and $B$. There's a cost function defined, so that I know a positive cost (or distance) of any assignment $(a,b)\;|\;a \in A,\; b \in B$. It always holds that $|B| \leq |A|$, ie the number of b's will always be less or equal to number of a's. The task is: For every $b \in B$ find some $a \in A$, minimizing the sum of individual costs, and satisfying the condition that every $b$ is assigned to exactly one $a$, and each $a$ is assigned to one or zero $b$s. To state it clearly, the assignment satisfying the constraints is a bijective mapping $A^* \rightarrow B$, where $A^* \subseteq A$ and $|A^*|=|B|$. I think this is a variant of the Assignment problem , but I'm not sure how to modify it to handle the case when the size of sets is not equal (some agents will be idle). Maybe the modification is not trivial, right? Another idea would be to solve it by a brute-force algorithm assigning the closest unassigned $a$ for each $b$ (one after another) and backtracking when a better assignment for that $a$ is found later, but that's quite ugly.

255498,Has this algebraic structure been named or studied?,"Apologies if this is is not very well-defined or exposes my ignorance; I know comparatively little about abstract algebra. The structure of certain programming languages can be described with the algebraic structure $(S,\cdot,\verb|^|)$ where $\cdot:S\times S\rightarrow S$ is associative and unital, and $\verb|^| : S \rightarrow S$ i.e., a monoid with an extra unary operation.  Unfortunately, nothing much can be said about $\verb|^|$ except that: $\verb|^|$ distributes over $\cdot$ , i.e., $\verb|^|(a\cdot b) = \verb|^|a\cdot \verb|^|b$ . $\verb|^|$ is cancellative: $\verb|^|a = \verb|^|$ b implies $a = b$ . In particular, $\verb|^|$ is not an inverse operation, nor idempotent; in general, $\verb|^|(\verb|^|a) \neq a$ , and in particular, $\verb|^|1\neq1$ . My question is: Has this structure been studied, or at least been given a name, in abstract algebra? I'm not optimistic, because adding $\verb|^|$ doesn't appear to make the structure much more interesting than a monoid.  But if anyone can even point me towards similar structures, I'd be grateful.  (Although clearly groups are not a good fit because of the lack of invertibility.) ( Edited to include the cancellative property of $\verb|^|$ and to explicitly mention its non-idempotency.) A concrete example of the structure is: strings of symbols with brackets, with a semantics which gives the substrings inside brackets a different meaning. Joy is one such programming language based on this framework. The underlying monoid for Joy is well-described in that paper , but the bracketing operator (Joy's [...], my ^) is much less well-described algebraically, and I'm trying to find out more about where it might fit in (or be made to fit in.)","['formal-languages', 'terminology', 'abstract-algebra']"

I found the following statement in this paper (section 2.1, page 3): Let $F=f(W(h_1),\ldots,W(h_n))$ where $f$ is bounded and smooth (with
  bounded derivatives) and $W(h_j) := \int_0^T h_j(s) \, dB_s$ for some
  $h_j \in L^2$. Then the Malliavin derivative is given by $$D_t F =\sum_{i=1}^n \partial_i f(W(h_1),\ldots,W(h_n)) \cdot h_i(t)$$ and
  $X_s = \mathbb{E}(D_s F|\mathcal{F}_s)$ in (1). So let $f$ be bounded and smooth and consider $F := f(B_T)$. Then (using the notation from above) $$W(h_1) := \int_0^T \underbrace{1}_{=:h_1} \, dB_s = B_T \qquad F=f(W(h_1))$$ By the given formula I obtain $$D_t F = f'(B_T) \cdot 1 \\
\Rightarrow F = \mathbb{E}F + \int_0^T f'(B_T) \, dB_s \tag{2}$$ On the other hand I could also apply Itô's formula, $$\underbrace{f(B_T)}_{F}-f(0) = \int_0^T f'(B_s) \, dB_s + \frac{1}{2} \int_0^T f''(B_s) \, ds \tag{3}$$ Is it correct like that?

I want to invite as many people as possible to my birthday party.
I do not want people who have the same birthday as me to attend.
Everyone I invite who does not share my birthday will attend.
People who do share my birthday will be jealous and only have
a 1 in 3 chance of attending the party if they are invited.

How many invitations should I send if I want there to be no more than
a 50% chance of someone with the same birthday as me showing up? Now, I tried to approach this as follows: The chance that a random other person would have the same birthday as you is 1/365. The chance that someone who has the same birthday as you would accept the invitation is 1/3. Therefore the combined probability of someone having the same birthday and choosing to attend is 1/1095. Every time another person attends we are adding one more chance of the above happening, so we can think of this as: 0.5 = n/1095 therefore n = 0.5 / (1/1095) = 547.5 Well, I was told that the above is not correct, but the reason why I was wrong and the correct approach to understanding this problem was not explained to me.

I want to show that if a finite abelian group has elements of order $m$ and $n$ then it will have an element of order $\text{lcm}(m,n)$. First I proved the lemma if $a$ has order $m$ and $b$ has order $n$ with $m,n$ coprime, then $ab$ has order $mn$. This is because the subgroups $\langle a \rangle$ and $\langle b \rangle$ have trivial intersection (because the order of their intersection must divide their orders $m$ and $n$, which is a consequence of it being a subgroup of both), which implies $a^{i} \in \langle b \rangle$ iff $i \equiv 0 \pmod n$, and similarly $b^{i} \in \langle a \rangle$ iff $i \equiv 0 \pmod m$. Using that we deduce that $(ab)^i = a^i b^i = 1$ iff $i \equiv 0 \pmod {mn}$. So if $a$ was an element of order $m$ and $b$ and element of $n$ with $g = \gcd(m,n) \not = 1$ I thought that $\text{lcm}(m,n) = \frac{m}{g}n$ so and $\frac{m}{g},n$ are coprime so I should construct an element (from $a$) with order $\frac{m}{g}$ then conclude the theorem by the lemma. For the construction I think it's just $a^g$. I just have a nagging doubt about the correctness of the second proof, did I miss some important detail?

Given that $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$, this proof needs to be tweaked in some way... But I'm not exactly sure how to do it. Intuitively speaking, I believe that the correct approach would be to decompose $N[0,t]$ into $N[0,\lfloor t\rfloor]$ and $N[\lfloor t\rfloor, t]$, and argue that the latter term $\rightarrow 0$ almost surely.

False. An infinite series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n$ of real-valued functions on a metric space $E$ converges uniformly if and only if, given any $\epsilon \gt 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for any $n \gt m \ge N$, $$|f_{m+1}(x)+f_{m+2}(x)+\dots+f_n(x)|\lt\epsilon$$ for all $x\in E$. Now let $$f_n(x) = \frac{\sin x}{1+n^2x^2}$$ For small enough $\epsilon \gt 0,\ \sin \epsilon$ ~ $ \epsilon$. So in particular, $\sin \frac{\epsilon}{m} \gt \frac{\epsilon}{2m}$ for any positive integer $m$. Choose $\epsilon$ small enough such that the above holds and also 
$$\frac{1}{1+16\epsilon^2}\gt \frac{2}{3}$$ Now let $N$ be any positive integer and let $x = \frac{\epsilon}{N} \lt \pi$. For this fixed $x$, $f_n(x)$ is strictly decreasing as $n \to \infty$. So we get $$|f_{N+1}(x)+f_{N+2}(x)+\dots+f_{4N}(x)|$$
$$\gt 3N (f_{4N}(x))$$
$$= 3N \frac {\sin \frac{\epsilon}{N}}{1+16N^2(\frac{\epsilon}{N})^2}$$
$$\gt 3N \frac {\frac {\epsilon}{2N}}{1+16\epsilon^2}$$
$$= (\frac{3}{2})(\frac{1}{1+16\epsilon^2})(\epsilon)$$

If so, that would seem quite odd, seeing as the textbook doesn't introduce that topic until a few sections later.","['logic', 'propositional-calculus', 'discrete-mathematics']"
256311,Determine injective or surjective of these functions,"I have the following functions: $$
\begin{align}
f&: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \\
g&: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}
\end{align}
$$
defined by $f(x, y) = (x + y, x)$ and $g(x, y) = (x - y, y)$. a) Calculate $g\circ f$ for the originals $(2, 2), (3, 5)$ and $(4, 1)$.
$$
\begin{align}
f(2, 2) &= (2 + 2, 2) = (4, 2) \text{ and then }  g(4, 2) = (4 - 2, 2) = (2, 2)\\
f(3, 5) &= (3 + 5, 3) = (8, 3) \text{ and then } g(8, 3) = (8 - 3, 3) = (5, 3)\\
f(4, 1) &= (4 + 1, 4) = (5, 4) \text{ and then } g(5, 4) = (5 - 4, 4) = (1, 4)
\end{align}
$$ b) Give a function description for the function $h: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ with $h = g \circ f$ and show that it counts for all $x$, $y$ element of $\mathbb{N}$. I have no idea how to tackle these two questions, don't even know where to begin. c) Show that $f$ is injective, but not surjective. To show that something is injective, I would need to find an element of the codomain that does not have an element in the domain. To find something that is surjective, I would need to find an element in the codomain that has more than one original. Some sample input/output data: input  ->  output $$
\begin{align}
(0, 0) &\to (0, 0)\\
(0, 1) &\to (1, 0)\\
(0, 2) &\to (2, 0)\\
...&\text{etc...}\\
(1, 0) &\to (1, 1)\\
(1, 1) &\to (2, 1)\\
...&\text{etc...}\\
(2, 0) &\to (2, 2)\\
(2, 1) &\to (3, 2)\\
\end{align}
$$
...etc... Now, if I have e.g. the element $(0, 1)$ in the codomain, then there is no corresponding element in the domain. In element $(0, 1), x = 1$, but then $y$ has to be $-1$ to make the $0$, and since the domain is $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$, this cannot be. Another example, this time with element $(1, 0)$ in the codomain. This means that $x = 0$, and that $y = 1$. So the corresponding element in the domain should then be $(0, 1)$, but when this element is put into $f$, it goes to $(1, 1)$. In other words, $(1, 0)$ also does not have an original. Is this evidence enough to say that this function is not surjective, or do I still need to prove it further? d) We confine the function $f$ now to
$$
f: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \{(n, m)\lvert n \geq m\}
$$
still with
$$
f(x, y) = (x + y, x).
$$
Show that the inverse of $f$ now does exist, and calculate this inverse. My problem here is that there are elements that satisfy $n \geq m$, but these are not inverse. For example, if I put $(2, 1)$ into $f$, the answer is $(3, 2)$. This is not the inverse of $(2, 1)$ What is the thinking mistake I'm making here?",['functions']
