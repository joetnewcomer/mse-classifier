1056678,Prove that the sequence $\cos(n\pi/3)$ does not converge,"EDIT: Using a rigorous formal proof, I need to prove that this sequence does not diverge. I of course understand why it doesn't converge... $n=1$ to infinity of course. So, I have a bit of trouble understanding the definition. Here's what I have so far: I know it doesn't converge if there exists an $\varepsilon > 0$ , where for ALL natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ , $|a_n - L| < \varepsilon$ , for some $n\in\mathbb N$ . So I can make $\varepsilon > 1/2$ , but then I'm not sure what to do. I know I need to prove this by way of contradiction using 2 cases, one where I evaluate $L$ as both greater than and equal the other where it's less than zero.","['solution-verification', 'sequences-and-series', 'proof-writing', 'number-theory']"

1056744,What is a Euclidean Graph? Can edges be negative in a Euclidean Graph?,"To my understanding a graph is Euclidean if each edges connecting two vertices represents the distance between those two vertices, where the vertices are points in a plane. This is all I found in the Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_graph_theory Is this really the only thing that makes a graph Euclidean? I mean, I feel like this is a skimpy description. It doesn't seem like a rigorous definition. I am wondering things like: Are they referring to the ""planes"" we know from geometry? Or some other type of coordinate system? If that's the case, then all edges must be nonnegative, right? Thanks in advance.","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1056752,Is it possible to create division via Set Theory?,"I've been reading a book on Set Theory (Charles C. Pinter), and it says, ...set theory is recognized to be the cornerstone of the ""new"" mathematics... [emph. added] and that ...we can still form all the sets essential for mathematics ... [emph. added] Background The book also states that Set Theory can be used to form the framework for mathematics (I am regrettably unable to quote Pinter on that). For example, if $A$ and $B$ are two disjoint sets, and that $a=\# A$ and $b=\# B$ denote that $a$ and $b$ are the cardinal numbers representing $A$ and $B$ respectively, then: $$a+b=\#(A\cup B),$$ and that $$a\cdot b=\#(A\times B).$$ Exponentiation can be produced by: Let $a$ and $b$ be cardinal numbers, and let $I$ be a set such that $b=\#I$ . If $a=a_i$ , $\forall i\in I$ , then: $$a^b=\bigotimes_{i\in I}a_i.$$ where $$\bigotimes_{i\in I}a_i=\#\left(\prod_{i\in I}A_i\right),$$ when $A_i$ is a family of sets, $a_i=\# A_i, \forall i\in I$ . Question This, oddly enough, is where Pinter decided to stop. He did not say how to produce division, or even the subtraction of cardinal numbers. I guess the subtraction of a cardinal would be (assuming that $0=\varnothing$ , $1=\{\varnothing\}$ , $2=\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\}$ ... or that $0=\varnothing$ , $1=\{0\}$ , $2=\{0,1\}$ ...), and if $a=\#A$ and $b=\#B$ : $$a-b=A\setminus B,$$ but this, to my knowledge, only works when $a\geq b$ , for one cannot have a cardinal (let's say $x$ ) where $x<0$ (because that means the set is a proper subset of $\varnothing$ , which is impossible). How can I use Set Theory to represent functions like subtraction and division?","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"
1056812,Solvability of Artin-Schreier Polynomial,"I'm having a hard time trying to prove that the polynomial f(x) = x^p - x - 1 in Z_p[x] is not solvable by radicals even though its Galois Group is solvable. So far, I have shown that the polynomial is irreducible in the base field and that its Galois group is isomorphic to Z_p. Since the Galois group is cyclic, it is solvable. I have also shown that if n is a root of f then the pth root of n is not a root of f by the definition of solvable by radicals given to us, which is definition 2 in the link below: http://www.math.brown.edu/~abrmovic/MA/f1314/251/Zijian-notes.pdf","['galois-theory', 'finite-fields', 'irreducible-polynomials', 'group-theory']"
1056814,Find the Area Using Polar Coordinates and a Double Integral,"Of the area inside the smaller loop of the equation $r = 1-2sin\theta$ Here's my attempt at a solution: The shape has an inner and an outer loop, both of which will terminate at the origin. Therefore, I want to find the range of the equation which only draws the inner loop. I would assume I would select a range for $\theta$ which would set $r=0$, however, I'm honestly not sure how I would go about doing that. I can't just take all the points where $r = 0$, because then the outer loop will be included as well. How do I set this integral up? Note: I've tried to find answers online and stumbled onto this, but cannot make heads or tails of what is being described. The document claims that $ θ = ±π/4$ and $θ = ±3π/4$ are the candidates, but when I use the equation $sin\theta = 1/2$, I end up with π/6. http://jacobi.math.wvu.edu/~hjlai/Teaching/Tip-Pdf/Tip3-34.pdf (Example 3)","['multivariable-calculus', 'polar-coordinates', 'calculus', 'area']"
1056863,Possible values of $\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right)^x$,"I was asked by some freshmen the follwing two questions regarding the limit: Using the fact that 
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^x = e$$ evaluate
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(1 + \frac{3}{x^2}\right)^x$$
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{x^2-2x-3}{x^2-3x-28}\right)^x$$ I got the answers $1$ and $e$ respectively. Hope nothing wrong. In the second question, my attempt is like this: $$\frac{x^2-2x-3}{x^2-3x-28} = \frac{(x-3)(x+1)}{(x-7)(x+4)}$$
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{x-3}{x-7}\right)^x = e^{4}$$
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{x+1}{x+4}\right)^x = e^{-3}$$
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{x^2-2x-3}{x^2-3x-28}\right)^x = e^4e^{-3} = e$$ We can also do the other way round: 
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{x-3}{x+4}\right)^x = e^{-7}$$
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{x+1}{x-7}\right)^x = e^{8}$$ Indeed, the power of $e$ in the final answer is the difference of the sums of roots of $x^2-2x-3$ in the numerator and $x^2-3x-28$ in the denominator. From this question, I suspect that $$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{x^n + \alpha_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + \alpha_0}{x^n + \beta_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + \beta_0}\right)^x = e^{\alpha_{n-1} - \beta_{n-1}}$$ is true, but I have no idea how to prove it, if the polynomials are not able to be factorized. The freshmen had not learnt the rule yet. It would be good if there is a proof without using the rule to let them know an easy way to check their answers and why this way holds.","['calculus', 'limits']"

Proof: Ignoring the orthognality condition, there are many possible quadrangles with the given angles that can be continuously transformed into each other. For such let $P$ denote the intersection of $AC$ and $BD$. In the degenerate case $A=B$, we get $\angle CPD=\alpha+\beta-180^\circ<90^\circ$, in the degenerate case $B=C$, we get $\angle DPA=\beta+\gamma-180^\circ<90^\circ$. Then the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a case where $\angle CPD=90^\circ$. $_\square$ My question is: Can someone provide a proof not relying on continuity arguments?

So if I prove that $\frac{1}{n+\frac{10100}{n}}$ is monotone for large $n$ and converges to $0$ then I'm done. Convergence to $0$ is trivial so all I need to do is to prove that the sequence is monotone, for sufficiently large $n$. Here is what I've done: $\frac{1}{n+1+\frac{10100}{n+1}}-\frac{1}{n+\frac{10100}{n}}=\frac{n+\frac{10100}{n}-n-1-\frac{10100}{n+1}}{(n+1+\frac{10100}{n+1})(n+\frac{10100}{n})}$ The denominator is always positive so I'm only examining the numerator now. $n+\frac{10100}{n}-n-1-\frac{10100}{n+1}=\frac{10100(n+1)-10100n-n(n+1)}{n(n+1)}$ Again, the denominator is always positive, so let's examine the numerator. $10100(n+1)-10100n-n(n+1)=10100-n^2-n=10100-(n^2+n)$ which is less than zero for sufficiently large $n$.

If $p(z)=q(z)$ at $n+1$ distinct points of the plane, the $p(z)=q(z)$ for all $z\in \mathbb{C}$. I attempted showing this is by taking the polynomial $r(z)=p(z)-q(z)$. Since both $p(z)$ and $q(z)$ are both polynomials of degree $n$, $r(z)$ can either be identically zero ($r(z)\equiv 0$), or it can be a polynomial of a degree less than $n$. However, if $p(z)=q(z)$ at $n+1$ distinct points, then $r(z)=0$ at $n+1$ points, which can only happen if $r(z)\equiv 0$ by the fundamental theorem of algebra. Hence, $p(z)=q(z)$. $\blacksquare$.

1057827,"A space is completely regular if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of $[0,1]^ J$ for some $J$","This is a theorem from Topology by James Munkres. Theorem 34.3 A space is completely regular if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of $[0,1]^ J$    for some $J$ The book merely states that this theorem is an immediate corollary of the fact that the existence of a family of continuous functions that separate points from closed sets in a space $X$ is equivalent, for a space $X$ in which one-point sets are closed, to the requirement that $X$ be completely regular. I have proved the right direction, that is, if a space is completely regular then it is homeomorphic to a subspace of $[0,1]^ J$    for some $J$. However, I don't see how I can show that a space $X$ that is homeomorphic to a subspace of a cube is completely regular. One more question after looking at the book again regarding the third paragraph. The existence of a family of continuous functions that separate points from closed sets in a space X, implies, for a T1 space X, that X is completely regular. I see that in this case, for any point $x \in X$ and each closed set $A$ not containing $x$, $A^{c}$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ so there is a continuous map $f_{\alpha}$ in the family that is positive at $x$ and vanishes outside $A$. But the definition of completely regular in this text says that a space $X$ is T1 and for each point $x_0$ and each closed set $A$ not containing $x_0$, there is a continiuous function $f: X \to [0,1]$ such that $f(x_0)=1$ and $f(A)={0}$. However, the fact above only guarantees that $f_{\alpha}(x) \gt 0$ and not $f_{\alpha}: X \to [0,f_{\alpha}(x)]$. So how does the existence of such a family guarantee that $X$ be completely regular? Any solutions, hints or suggestions would be appreciated.",['general-topology']

The student is allowed to pass mock exams who have the same questions as the real exam. After each mock exam the teacher tells the student how many right answers he got, and when the student feels ready, he can pass the real exam. Show that if the student is good at combinatorics he can guess all the answers after only $2^{k}$ mock exams. For those who prefer a more formal presentation of the problem: if $E=\{1,-1\}^{N}$ we seek $n$ so that for some vectors $v_{1},v_{2}, \ldots, v_{n}\in E$
\begin{align*}
\phi\colon E &\rightarrow \mathbb{N}^{n},\\
v &\mapsto (\langle v,v_{1}\rangle, \langle v,v_{2}\rangle, \ldots, \langle v,v_{n}\rangle)

is injective. Show that it is possible to find such vectors when $N=k2^{k-1}$ and $n=2^{k}$. It is possible to use duality to transform again the problem. We seek a $n\times N$ matrix $M$ such that $v\mapsto Mv$ is injective over $E$. If $X$ is the formal polynomial vector $X=(X_{1},X_{2}, \ldots,X_{n})$ then $v\mapsto Mv$ is injective iff $v\mapsto \langle X,Mv \rangle$ also is. But $\langle X,Mv \rangle = \langle M^{T}X, v \rangle$ and it is easily seen that $v\mapsto \langle M^{T}X,v \rangle$ is injective iff the $N$ column vectors $x_{i}$ of $M$ are such that $\sum_{i\in I} x_{i}\neq \sum_{j\in J} x_{j}$ for any two different subsets $I$, $J$ of $\{1,\dots,N\}$. This problem comes from an olympiad-like contest. The original problem was formulated with 30 questions and the aim was to prove that the student could guess with 24 trials. One of my teachers came up with the result above (which would give 16 trials for 30 questions), but I can't remember his proof or find another one by myself. I tagged this information theory because some probabilistic arguments show that it is impossible to do better than this asymptotically. More precisely, if we choose the coordinates of the $v$ defined above randomly, then
\begin{equation*}
N =  H(\phi(v))
\leqslant  \sum_{i} H(\langle v,v_{i} \rangle) = nH(B(N,1/2)) \sim (n/2)\log_{2}(N)

We have: $$1+i = a^2+b^2 + 2abi,$$ so $a^2+b^2 = 1$ and $ab = 1/2$. This already seems wrong to me, because we know that $|1+i| = \sqrt{2} \implies |\sqrt{1+i}| = \sqrt[4]{2},$ regardless of what root we choose. Let's pretend everything is ok. Substituition gives $$a^2 + \frac{1}{4a^2} = 1 \implies a^4 - a^2 + \frac{1}{4} = 0 \implies a^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies a = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},$$ and $$b = \pm\frac{1}{2\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \pm\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = a.$$ And writing $1+i = re^{i((\pi/4)+2k\pi)}$, we get the roots are given by $\sqrt[4]{2}e^{i((\pi/8)+k\pi)}$. Now, $z = x+iy \implies \tan \arg(x+iy) = y/x$ would give us $\tan \pi/8 = 1$! Can someone give me a light here? It must be simple, but I'm failing to make sense of this. Thanks.

1058357,Proof that any set linearly independent has at most $n$ elements (when the vector space has basis with n elements),"My teacher gave us this proof today, but I don't know if I understood it entirely: Theorem: Suppose $V$ a vector space (finitely generated) over the reals. $$B = \{v_1,\cdots, v_n\}$$
where $B$ is a basis for $V$. Suppose, also, a set $S\subset V$ L.I., then $S$ is finite and has at most $n$ elements. Proof: Let $S = \{y_1,\cdots,y_m\}$, with $m>n$. Suppose $S$ is L.I. Then:
  $$\alpha_1y_1+\cdots+\alpha_my_m = 0\tag{1}$$ But since $S$ is greater
  than $B$, and $B$ is a basis, $S$ can be spanned by $B$. So any
  $y_i\in S$ can be written as a linear combination of $B$, in this way:
  $$\\y_1 = \beta_{11}v_1+\cdots+\beta_{n1}v_n\\y_2 =
 \beta_{12}v_1+\cdots+\beta_{n2}v_n\\\cdots\\y_m =
 \beta_{1m}v_1+\cdots+\beta_{nm}v_n$$ Substituting the system above in
  $(1)$, we have:
  $$\alpha_1(\beta_{11}v_1+\cdots+\beta_{n1}v_n)+\cdots+\alpha_m(\beta_{1m}v_1+\cdots+\beta_{nm}v_n)
 = 0\implies\\ (\beta_{11}\alpha_1+\beta_{12}\alpha_2+\cdots+\beta_{1m}\alpha_m)v_1+\cdots+(\beta_{n1}\alpha_1+\beta_{n2}\alpha_2+\cdots+\beta_{nm}\alpha_m)v_m
 = 0$$ But since $B$ is L.I., then the linear combination above implies the coefficients are all $0$. Therefore we end up with the system: $$\begin{cases}\beta_{11}\alpha_1+\beta_{12}\alpha_2+\cdots+\beta_{1m}\alpha_m = 0\\
 \cdots \\
 \beta_{n1}\alpha_1+\beta_{n2}\alpha_2+\cdots+\beta_{nm}\alpha_m = 0\end{cases}$$
  that has $n$ equations, and $m$ variables, therefore is compatible and
  indeterminated, that implies it has infinitely many solutions. One of
  them is not trivial, so $S$ is L.D. I think wikipedia has a similar proof, but there, it proves directly that any basis has the same number of elements ( could you tell me why a vector $v_i$ suddenly appears in the middle of the proof ?. In this proof, the conclusion is that $S$ has at most $n$ elements.
