346009,Prove that $Y$ is Hausdorff iff $X$ is Hausdorff and $A$ is a closed subset of $X$,"Let $X$ be a topological space and $A$ a subset of $X$. On $X\times\{0,1\}$ define the partition composed of the pairs $\{(a,0),(a,1)\}$ for $a\in A$, and of the singletons $\{(x,i)\}$ if $x\in X\setminus A$ and $i \in \{0,1\}$. Let $R$ be the equivalence relation defined by this partition, let $Y$ be the quotient space $[X \times \{0,1\}]/R$ and let $p:X \times \{0,1\} \to Y$ be the quotient map. (a) Prove that there exists a continuous map $f:Y \to X$ such that $f \circ p(x,i)=x$ for every $x\in X$ and $i \in \{0,1\}$. (b) Prove that Y is Hausdorff if and only if X is Hausdorff and A a closed subset of X . So far I have done part (a), but am struggling with part (b). I am thinking I will have to use the fact that if a quotient space $Z/R$ is Hausdorff then the graph of the equivalence relation in $Z \times Z$ is closed. However, I am not positive.

346018,Grasping the definition of open and closed sets,"In a metric subspace $S = [0,1]$ of $\mathbb{R}^1$, why is it that every interval of the form $[0,x)$ or $(x,1], x\in (0,1)$, is an open set in $S$? I understand that if you were to remove either, then the remaining is a closed set; hence both $[0,x)$ or $(x,1]$ are open sets. The definition I'm having difficulty with is the one that involves interior points. WLOG, taking $[0,x)$, if I were to take an open ball centered at some point near $0$ with radius $\epsilon$, then if I wanted to include $0$, the open ball would have to go beyond $0$. This doesn't quite make sense to me. Could someone please clarify this?","['general-topology', 'solution-verification', 'metric-spaces', 'analysis']"
346034,Proof by induction; $a^n$ divides $b^n$ implies $a$ divides $b$,"I want to prove by induction that $a^n \mid b^n$ implies that $a \mid b$ holds for all integers $n\geq 1$. Clearly for $n=1$ this is true, since if $a \mid b$, then $a \mid b$. Suppose this is true for some $n = k$. Then $a^k \mid b^k$, so $a|b$. $a^k \mid b^k$ means there exists some integer $m$ such that $b^k = ma^k$, and $a \mid b$ means there exists an integer $r$ such that $b=ra$. Then we can multiply both sides of the above equality by any constant, namely $b$. Then $b \cdot b^k = bma^k$ so $b^{k+1} = (ra)ma^k = rma^{k+1}$ which means that $a^{k+1} \mid b^{k+1}$ completing the induction step, and thus proving that for all integers $n \geq1$ the original statement holds. Are there any logical holes in the proof?","['induction', 'elementary-number-theory', 'proof-writing', 'number-theory']"
346046,History of Conic Sections,"Recently, I came to know that ancient Greeks had already studied conic sections. I find myself wondering if they knew about things like directrix or eccentricity. (I mean familiar with these concepts in the spirit not in terminology). This is just the appetizer. What I really want to understand is what will make someone even think of these (let me use the word) contrived constructions for conic sections. I mean let us pretend for a while that we are living in the $200$ BC period. What will motivate  the mathematicians of our time (which is $200$ BC) study the properties of figures that are obtained on cutting a cone at different angles to its vertical? Also, what will lead them to deduce that if the angle of cut is acute then the figure obtained has the curious property that for any point on that figure the sum of its distances from some $2$ fixed points a constant. And in the grand scheme of things how do our friend mathematicians deduce the concepts of directrix and eccentricity (I am not sure if this was an ancient discovery, but in all, yes I will find it really gratifying to understand the origin of conic sections). Please shed some light on this whenever convenient. I will really find it helpful. Thanks","['geometry', 'math-history']"

346092,A question regarding representation of a function as a power series,"I'm trying to help my brother with a calculus problem related to the representation of a function as a power series. The task is to find what power series is represented by the following function, and what is its interval of convergence: $$f(x)= \frac{4}{4 + x^2} \text{, where the center of the series is }c=0 \text{.} $$ $\textbf{My attempt at a solution:} $ I write $\frac{4}{4+ x^2}= \frac{1}{1+ x^2/4}$. Now I know that $\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n= \frac{a}{1-r}$, so in our case I believe we have $a=1, r=-\frac{x^2}{4}$. From this I conclude that $$\frac{4}{4+ x^2}= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(-\frac{x^2}{4}\right)^n \text{.}$$ This series converges for $|-\frac{x^2}{4}| < 1$, implying that $|x^2|<4$, and thus $|x|<2$, right? If this is correct, then that means the radius of convergence for this series is $R= 2$. I checked that this series diverges for $x= -2,2$. Therefore, we get that the interval of convergence for this series is the open interval $(-2,2)$. Was this the correct approach to be using? Please let me know if there are any mistakes, thanks.","['power-series', 'calculus']"

346134,Packing radios into cartons - why is my solution wrong?,"A manufacturer of car radios ships them to retailers in cartons of $n$ radios. The profit per radio is $\$59.50$, minus shipping cost of $\$25$ per carton, so the profit is $59.5n-25$ dollars per carton. To promote sales by assuring high quality, the manufacturer promises to pay the retailer $\$200X^2$ if $X$ radios in the carton are defective. Suppose radios are produced independently and that $5\%$ of radios are defective. How many radios should be packed per carton to maximize expected net profit per carton? My solution: Suppose that $n$ radios are packed into a carton. Then, the expected profit is clearly $$\mu = 59.5n-25-200(0.05n)^2$$ Simplifying we get $$\mu = 59.5n-25-0.5n^2$$ We want to find a maximum, so we find a derivative: $$\mu'=59.5-n^2$$ Clearly there is just one maximum, so set $\mu'=0$ we find that $$n^2=59.5$$ and thus $$n\approx 7.7136\dots$$This however seems to be wrong.

346136,Riemann Stieltjes integral definition and implications,"I am studying the Riemann Stieltjes on Tom Apostol's book mathematical analysis second edition and I have a the following question. Given $[a,b]$ we define a partition of this interval to be a set $P = \{a = x_0, ..., x_n = b\}$ Suppose $ f,g:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $f$ is Riemman integrable with respect to $g$ on $[a,b]$ ie for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $P_{\varepsilon}$ partition of $[a,b]$ such that for every $P\subseteq P_{\varepsilon}$ and any choice of points $\{t_k\}$, (the points within each subinterval of the partition), we have that: $\left | S(P,f,g) - A \right | < \varepsilon$ for some real $A$ which is what we denote by $\int_{a}^{b} fdg(x)$. Now, my question is, 1) if given the fact that $f$ is integrable with respect to $g$ on $[a,b]$ can we say that $f$ is integrable with respect to $g$ on $(a,b)$ or $(a,b]$ or $[a,b)$? 2) If yes is it direct from the definition??(please be rigorous and not intuitive) 3) Are the integrals always equal? Is it direct from the definition that the integrals on those intervals are equal? What i see is that the Riemann sums are not equal since $S(P,f,g) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} f(t_k)(g(x_k)-g(x_{k-1})) $ so when the endpoints are not included we don't have the $g(a)/g(b)$ terms. In terms of Lebesgue integration one could say that if $g$ is nonnegative and $f$ is measurable then $f1_{[a,b]} = f1_{[a,b)}$ a.s with respect to the measure induced by g, so the corresponding integrals are equal. Here in Riemann Stieltjes integration does the definition imply directly a same argument or we need some Lebesgue-related proposition??

The set $\{x : f(x) \ge a\}$ is measurable. The set $\{x : f(x) \gt a\}$ is measurable.

346205,Discontinuities of $\sum \frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho}$,"H. Edwards in his book on the zeta function says that $\sum\frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho}$ converges conditionally ""even when $\rho ,1-\rho$ are paired."" I tried calculating some terms (n = 500 or so) and noticed the result below. Could be bad programming on my part or an aspect of the calculation for low numbers. The expressions below assume RH but I am asking about the calculation for small finite n. It may be that an answer has to assume RH. $$\sum \frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho} = \sum_n \frac{x^{\rho_n}}{\rho_n}+\frac{x^{1-\rho_n}}{1-\rho_n}$$ seems to be zero or (to be piecewise continuous and) have discontinuities at x = prime. And like (for example) square wave Fourier approximations there is a noticeable Gibbs-like effect near these discontinuities. $\rho_n$ are non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. I should add the possibility that what appears to be prime may be nearly prime. I checked through $x = 100.$ 83 seemed doubtful until I used a better approximation and 97 seems to require more summands than I have time to calculate. Primes are not the only such points. The expression appears to show the same behavior for a lot of composites (4 is one) less than 20 but fewer as x grows. Can anyone explain why this would be so? Thank you. FWIW as a check on my work I think that the expression below in which $\alpha_{n}$ are imaginary part of $\rho_n$ is equivalent and (like the 2d one above) assumes RH. It seems to give the same approximation as the second expression above. $$\sum_{\zeta(\rho)=0}\frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho} = \sqrt{x}\cdot\sum_{n =1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(\alpha_{n}\ln x)+2\alpha_{n}\sin(\alpha_{n}\ln x)}{1/4+\alpha_{n}^2}\hspace{5mm}$$","['sequences-and-series', 'riemann-zeta', 'complex-analysis']"

346275,Radical/Prime/Maximal ideals under quotient maps,"Let $I$ be an ideal of a ring (commutative with unity) $R$ and let $q:R\to R/I$ be the quotient map.

I had to show that $J$ is radical/prime/maximal iff $J'$ is radical/prime/maximal. Showing $J$ is radical/prime/maximal if $J'$ is was simple enough by direct element manipulation arguments. For the other direction, I did it by using $J'=J/I,$ the fact that ideals are radical/prime/maximal iff their quotient rings are reduced/domains/fields and the second isomorphism theorem. However, I tried unsuccessfully to find a ""direct"" proof that perhaps manipulates elements of the ring in a similar way to the other direction. Is there a more direct proof?

346287,How to find the splitting field and Galois group of $x^6 -4x^3 +1$?,"I am trying to find the splitting field $L$ of the $x^6 -4x^3 +1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and its Galois group. Here are some things I have figured out. I did the usual trick of solving for $x^3 = 2\pm \sqrt{3}$, which shows that $i, \sqrt{3}$ are both in the Galois group. 
I know that $\mathrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{Q})$ is non-abelian and I tried reducing mod primes to see what cycles might appear. For example, $$x^6 -4x^3 +1 \equiv (x-6)(x^2+6x+3)(x-2)(x^2+2x+4)\bmod 11,$$ which shows that the Galois group has a $4$-cycle. But generally I am stuck beyond these things and it would be great if someone could at least tell me of a simple way of calculating the degree of the splitting field. Edit:  Thank you for your help Steve and Hurkyl! After reading your solutions, I think I figured out a concrete way to verifying that the Galois group is $D_{12}$ once we know that the group has order 12. Let $\alpha = \sqrt[3]{2+\sqrt{3}}, \beta =  \omega \sqrt[3]{2+\sqrt{3}}, 
\gamma = \omega^2 \sqrt[3]{2+\sqrt{3}}$.
We know that the roots come in pairs $\alpha, \alpha^{-1}, \beta, \beta^{-1}, \gamma, \gamma^{-1}$ and the Galois group takes pairs to pairs. Also, 
$\alpha \beta \gamma =1$ and so the triple $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$  either goes to the same triple $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ or to the triple $\alpha^{-1}, \beta^{-1}, \gamma^{-1}$.  Now if we label the vertices of a hexagon with the roots so that the pairs of roots are opposite vertices, then we see that the Galois group must be a symmetry of the hexagon (here must use both the relations that the pairs of roots go to pairs and that triples go to triples). Thus we see that the Galois group is contained in $D_{12}$ under this identification. Since the order of the group is $12$, the group must be $D_{12}$.","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

346375,Commutative property of ring addition,"I have a simple question answer to which would help me more deeply understand the concept of (non)commutative structures. Let's take for example (our teacher's definition of) a ring: Let $R\neq \emptyset$ be a set, let $\oplus:R\times R \to R$ and $\bullet :R\times R \to R$ be binary operations. Moreover, let $(R, \oplus)$ be a commutative group, $(R, \bullet)$ be a monoid and following property holds for all $a, b, c\in R$ : $$a\bullet(b\oplus c) = (a\bullet b)\oplus(a \bullet c)$$ $$(b\oplus c)\bullet a = (b\bullet a)\oplus(c \bullet a)$$ Then ordered triple $\mathbf R = (R, \oplus, \bullet \mathbf)$ is called a (unitary) ring. Moreover, we call ring $\mathbf R$ commutative iff $(R, \bullet)$ is a commutative monoid. Commutativity of a ring is always a matter of its multiplicative operation because the additive operation is always assumed to be commutative . Could anyone explain me the bold part? Why do we even in non-commutative rings (and fields etc.) assume the addition to be always commutative? Is there some serious reason? Would it make any trouble?

If I'm only allowed to assume that $f(s)$ is continuous how can I show that $f(s)$ is also analytic?

I think there is something canonical here, hence i tried to show the existence of an iso only doing general considerations, not dealing with elements and their (possibly complicated) expressions.

Clearly, $i$ sends elements of $S$ in invertible elements of $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$. Now, let $\phi$ be the canonical morphism from $R_S$ to its localization $(R_S)_{\mathfrak{p}R_S}$.

be a sequence given by
$$
u_{n+1}=u_n-\lambda F(u_n) \quad \forall n\in \mathbb{N}.
$$
I would like to construct the above mapping $F$ such that 
the equation $F(u)=0$ has a solution and
the iterative sequence $\{u_n\}$ converges weakly to some solution of the latter equation, but not strongly . Note. We can prove that the iterative sequence $\{u_n\}$ converges weakly to some solution of the equation $F(u)=0$ provided that the latter equation has a solution. Let $u_*$ be a solution of $F(u)=0$. We observe that
\begin{eqnarray*}
\|u_{n+1}-u_*\|^2&=&\|u_n-\lambda F(u_n)-u_*+\lambda F(u_*)\|^2\\
                 &=& \|u_n-u_*\|^2-2\lambda\langle u_n-u_*, F(u_n)-F(u_*)\rangle+\lambda^2\|F(u_n)-F(u_*)\|^2\\

                 &=&\|u_n-u_*\|^2-\frac{2\gamma-\lambda}{\lambda}\|u_n-u_{n+1}\|^2.

From these inequalities we deduce that $\{\|u_n-u_*\|\}$ is monotonically decreasing and so it is convergent. $\{\|u_n-u_{n+1}\|\}$ and $\{\|F(u_n)\|\}$ tend to $0$. $\{u_n\}$ is bounded and so it has a subsequence $\{u_{n_k}\}$
converges weakly to $\bar{u}$. $\bar{u}$ is a solution of $F(u)=0$, and so $\{u_n\}$ converges weakly to $\bar{u}$.","['sequences-and-series', 'weak-convergence', 'analysis', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
346945,Behaviour of Two Coupled Sequences Towards a Stable Distribution,"The following question arises from research that I am doing in swarm intelligence. The relationships given come from geometric considerations which, I believe, should not be relevant for this problem. However, if anyone deems it necessary, I would be happy to provide more information. I have studied this problem using numerical simulations, and what I am after now are leads on how I can attack this problem formally, or re-formulate it such that it becomes more manageable, etc. I am not a mathematician, so apologies in advance for any shortcomings in formulation and/or notation; any sort of suggestion to improve the problem would be very welcome and appreciated. Firstly, we define the following two piecewise functions, where $R$ and $r$ are constants, and $R>r$: $\delta(*) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if $(*)<R-r$}\\ \sqrt{\frac{R}{r}((*)^2 - (R-r)^2)} & \text{if $R-r\leq(*)\leq R+r$} \\ \frac{2Rr}{\sqrt{(*)^2 - (R^2+2Rr)}} & \text{if $(*) > R+r$}\end{cases}$ $f(*)=\begin{cases} (*) & \text{if $(*)<R-r$} \\ R-r & \text{if $R-r\leq(*)\leq R+r$} \\ \sqrt{(*)^2-4Rr} & \text{if $(*) > R+r$}\end{cases}$ Now, consider an large number of points $(x,y)$, initially all occupying the same point in the $xy$-plane, $(x_0, y_0)$. The points transform themselves in epochs, as follows. At the beginning of an epoch, a random 'coin toss' decides whether the points will be $x$-updated or $y$-updated. For an $x$-update, each point undergoes the following transformation: $y \leftarrow  y + \zeta \delta(x)\\ x \leftarrow f(x)$ where $\zeta$ is a random number between $-1$ and $1$ generated differently for each point (with a uniform distribution). A $y$-update is the inverse of what is described above: $x \leftarrow  x + \zeta \delta(y)\\ y \leftarrow f(y)$ What is happening is that, after each epoch, the points are forming a new distribution in the $xy$-plane. This distribution becomes continuous if the number of points is allowed to tend towards infinity. From numerical results, it turns out that this process has a single distribution that is a stable attractor for any initial condition $(x_0, y_0)$. After many epochs, the distribution tends towards two lines: one line is horizontal, located at $y=R-r$, and ranges from $x = 0$ to $x = R-r$. The other line is vertical, located at $x=R-r$, and ranges from $y=0$ to $y=R-r$.","['sequences-and-series', 'statistics', 'probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

Next, some derivatives: $f'(z)=1/z$ $f''(z)=-1/z^2$ $f'''(z)=2/z^3$ $f^{(4)}(z)=-6/z^4$ ... $f^{(n)}(z)=(-1)^{n+1}(n-1)!/z^n$ Hence, $$f(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_n(z-1)^n,$$ where $$c_n=\frac{f^{(n)}(1)}{n!}=\frac{(-1)^{n+1}(n-1)!}{n!(1)^n}=\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}.$$ Thus: $$f(z)=(z-1)-\frac{(z-1)^2}{2}+\frac{(z-1)^3}{3}-\frac{(z-1)^4}{4}+\frac{(z-1)^5}{5}-\cdots$$ And checking, $f(1)=0$, which is my assumption above. Question: Now, suppose I start the problem again, only this time I assume I am a different branch of the logarithm. Let's assume that this time we are working on the branch $\pi<\theta<3\pi$, so that $f(1)=\log(1)=2\pi i$. If I repeat the calculations above, what would they now look like, and what would be the answer for my series?",['complex-analysis']
