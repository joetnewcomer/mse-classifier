263876,Bound on the number of p-groups for fixed exponent,"It's well-known that for each prime number $p$ there are exactly two groups of order $p^2$, five of order $p^3$, and fifteen of order $p^4$ (at least when $p>3$). I know that the classification of $p$-groups gets much harder for higher exponents. But I wonder if $p$-groups with higher dimensions are still structured enough that they would at least theoretically allow a classification. In particular: Is there, for every natural $n$, a prime $p_0(n)$ and a number $m(n)$ such that for every $p \ge p_0(n)$ the number of groups of order $p^n$ equals $m(n)$? (For example, $m(2)=2,m(3)=5,m(4)=15$ for $p_0(2)=p_0(3)=2$ $p_0(4)=5$.)","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'p-groups']"
263879,Why does the set $\{ x \in \mathbb{Q} \mid x^2 \le 5\}$ not have a greatest element?,"I have just learned what the definition is of a supremum, and I am confused to something my textbooks says: Subsets with a supremum don't have to have a greatest element, for example: $$(0,3):  = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 0 < x < 3\}$$ and $$\{ x \in \mathbb{Q} \mid x^2 \le 5\}$$ I understand the first example since we know that the supremum is $3$ but the subset doesn't have a greatest element since it must be less than $3$ . I however do not understand the second one. If we solve $x^2 \le 5$ I believe we get $-\sqrt{5} \le x \le \sqrt{5}$ . Wouldn't this mean that $\sqrt{5}$ is the greatest element in this subset?","['algebra-precalculus', 'elementary-set-theory', 'supremum-and-infimum', 'maxima-minima']"
263885,Constructions of the smallest nonabelian group of odd order,"I write $|X|$ for the number of elements in a finite set $X$ .  Recall some basic facts: If $p$ is a prime number, then any group $G$ of order $p^2$ is abelian. Sketch of proof: Fix a prime $p$ and such a group $G$ .  The center $Z(G)$ of $G$ must be nontrivial by the class equation, and hence have order $p$ or $p^2$ .  So $G/Z(G)$ has order $p$ or $1$ .  So $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic.  So $G$ is abelian. If $p < q$ are prime numbers, then there is a nonabelian group of order $pq$ if and only if $q \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ , and in this case there is only one such nonabelian group (up to isomorphism). Sketch of proof: Fix primes $p < q$ and a group $G$ of order $pq$ .  Use Sylow theory to conclude that $G$ has a unique (and hence normal) subgroup $H_q$ of order $q$ , and a subgroup $H_p$ of order $p$ , and use elementary observations to verify that $H_q \cap H_p = \{1\}$ and $G = H_q H_p$ so that $G$ is some semidirect product $H_q \rtimes H_p$ .  Since $H_q$ is cyclic, $|\operatorname{Aut}(H_q)| = q-1$ , and so when $q \not\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ , Lagrange's theorem shows that there are no nontrivial homomorphisms $H_p \to \operatorname{Aut}(H_q)$ , implying that $G$ is abelian in this case.  When $q = 1 \pmod{p}$ , the existence of a nontrivial homomorphisms $H_p \to \operatorname{Aut}(H_q)$ and the independence of the structure of the resulting semidirect product on the choice of nontrivial homomorphism are discussed in this math.SE post . Together, these facts imply: There are no nonabelian groups of odd order less than $21$ . (The only odd numbers less than $21$ besides $1$ and primes to worry about are $9$ and $15$ , which are covered by the above general results.) There is a unique nonabelian group of order $21$ , and it can be realized by choosing any nontrivial homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \to \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z})$ and forming the corresponding semidirect product.  For example (taken from the above math.SE post), one could use the unique homomorphism sending $1$ to ""multiplication by $2$ "".) Now for my slightly subjective question: Are there ""less technical"" or ""more insightful"" constructions of the nonabelian group of order $21$ ? To be clearer about my kind of fuzzy requirements: I don't care if a construction doesn't shed any light on the nonexistence of nonabelian groups of smaller order. I do want it to be possible to define the group, and see that it is nonabelian, and of order 21, without drawing on too much group theoretical machinery. Ideally, the construction should minimize computation.  One could, for example, exhibit two permutations of a small finite set that generate the group--- but verifying that the group they generate has 21 elements and is nonabelian is entirely computational.  And even if the computations are well organized, this approach gives little idea of where such a group might ""come from"".  (If a specific presentation came with a geometrical insight making clear why the resulting group would have order $21$ without computation, that would be awesome.) To explain the motivation behind my question: I was teaching algebra, and was asked in office hours if nonabelian groups of odd order even existed .  ""Of course they do,"" I said.  Then I realized that it was rather difficult to exhibit one, given where we were in the class.  We had the basic homomorphism theorems, but: We hadn't done the Sylow theorems or semidirect products. We didn't know about finite fields yet. All of the members of the ""families of groups"" we had discussed up to that point--- symmetric groups, alternating groups, dihedral groups--- when nonabelian, have even order. All nonabelian groups of order less than $21$ , whether or not they into the families just mentioned, have even order. FWIW: the ""most elementary"" example of a small nonabelian group of odd order that I can think of is the set of all $3 \times 3$ matrices with entries in the field with $3$ elements that are both (a) upper triangular and (b) have all $1$ s down the diagonal.  (This is pretty clearly a nonabelian group, and just as clearly has $27$ elements.)  This happens to be the next smallest nonabelian group of odd order.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

263908,"When to create transcendental function to solve ""unsolvable problem""?","$\int \frac{1}{x} dx$ is an unsolvable problem using standard laws of Calculus (power rule) without the use of the function $f(x) = \ln x$ which was handcrafted by mathematicians to solve such problems. If we go back even further, the function $f(x) = \sin x$ was also a transcendental function used to describe the changing relationship between the arc and chord of a circle - it was not until 1682 that Leibniz proved that $\sin x$ was indeed not expressible as an algebraic function. Today, we still have expressions that can't be evaluated precisely such as $\int x^x dx$ because it cannot really be expressed as a function using the standard toolkit of algebraic and transcendental functions that we currently have.

I'm working on a small software project where I have a table with say 20 cells, and I want the cells' opacity to go down as the index goes up. Currently, I'm doing it linearly with $\textrm{opacity} = 1 - (\textrm{index}/20)$, or $y = 1-x$. The curve I'm going for is something where at the beginning I have a high value for the opacity, 1, but then it starts dropping like a roller-coaster, non-linearly. The best I can describe it is it looks like half of a 'C' draw on the positive xy axis. The closest I got was $y =  e^x$ , but that plot goes up. Can anyone tell me the name of what I'm looking for? Edit: Ok it turns out what I'm looking for is a hyperbola, $y = 1/x$. However, since this is a opacity value, the range needs to be from $0$ to $1$, while the domain is also $0$ to $1$.

263954,why do successive eigenfunctions have more oscillation?,"I was told the following argument as to why successive eigenfunctions tend to
have more oscillations: Suppose (without worrying about why) that the first eigenfunction has the least oscillation. The second eigenfunction is orthogonal to the first, thus it must have both positive and negative parts on the region where the 1st eigenfunction is positive, and similarly for the     region corresponding to the negative part of the 1st eigenfunction (if any). Thus each eigenfunction has more oscillations than the previous. Although I certainly believe the conclusion is true, I do not quite see that
this is a solid argument. Suppose the first eigenfunction is $\sin(x)$.
Then the second eigenfunction can be $-\sin(x)$, which is orthogonal to the first.
So, one can find an orthogonal function without using step 2 in the argument,
so (to me) the argument fails.  [Edit: a big error here-- I don't know how I was thinking that sin, -sin are orthogonal, they certainly are not] Is there a better intuitive argument for ``successive eigenfunctions have 
more oscillation''? (Or, point out the flaw in my thinking or description)","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'functional-analysis']"
263957,Why is the identity the only symmetric $0$-$1$ matrix with all eigenvalues positive?,"While thinking about this question I managed to convince myself that the identity is the only symmetric $0$-$1$ matrix with all eigenvalues positive.  However, the argument is rather low-level.  It does not give much insight into why, out of all symmetric matrices, $0$-$1$ matrices, and matrices with all eigenvalues positive, the identity is the only matrix that simultaneously has all three properties. So my question is Can someone give an intuitive explanation for why the identity is the only symmetric $0$-$1$ matrix with all eigenvalues positive? Such an explanation might entail a bigger-picture argument than the one I came up with. For reference, here's my argument.  Let $A$ be a symmetric $0$-$1$ matrix with all eigenvalues positive. Symmetric and all eigenvalues positive implies $A$ is positive definite. $A$ must have all $1$'s on its diagonal.  This is because $a_{jj} = 0 \implies {\bf e}_j^T A {\bf e}_j = 0$, which contradicts positive definite. $A$ must have all $0$'s for its off-diagonal elements.  This is because $A$ is symmetric implies $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$, and $a_{ij} = a_{ji} = 1 \implies ({\bf e}_i - {\bf e}_j)^T A ({\bf e}_i - {\bf e}_j) = 0$, which contradicts positive definite. Thus $A$ is the identity. For clarification : I am looking for an answer along these lines: ""A symmetric matrix implies or is equivalent to $X$ about the underlying linear transformation.  A $0$-$1$ matrix implies or is equivalent to $Y$ about the underlying linear transformation.  All eigenvalues positive implies or is equivalent to $Z$ about the underlying linear transformation.  ($X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are all big-picture properties.)  [Insert argument here.]  Thus the only matrix that simultaneously satisfies $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ is the identity."" Robert Israel's answer, while nice, is not the kind of thing I'm hoping for.  I view it as a more elegant version of my own low-level argument about what form the entries of the matrix have to take, not what kind of linear transformation has these three properties.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
263961,Applications of model theory to analysis,"Some of the more organic theories considered in model theory (other than set theory, which, from what I've seen, seems to be quite distinct from ""mainstream"" model theory) are those which arise from algebraic structures (theories of abstract groups, rings, fields) and real and complex analysis (theories of expansions of real and complex fields, and sometimes both). While relationships with algebra seem quite apparent, I wonder what are some interesting results in real and complex analysis that have nice model-theoretical proofs (or better yet, only model-theoretical proofs are known!)? Of course, there's nonstandard analysis, but I hope to see some different examples. That said, I wouldn't mind seeing a particularly interesting application of nonstandard analysis. :) I hope the question is at least a little interesting. I have only the very basic knowledge of model theory of that type (and the same applies to nonstandard analysis), so it may seem a little naive, but I got curious, hence the question.","['applications', 'model-theory', 'soft-question', 'real-analysis', 'complex-analysis']"

Then a Kernel Density Estimate, with a Gaussian kernel is done on the transformed data. However, the data must lie in the interval (0,1), so we only take the that part of the estimated density and then divide by the integral of that part of the density. The final step, which I don't understand is the formula below. What does the denominator mean? I understand that the numerator is the estimate of the transformed data set.

264013,A function over the integers and its fixed points,"Define $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ as follows, $f(n)$ is the number of times the digit ""1"" is needed if we were to write all integers between 1 and $n$ (inclusive) in base 10. So for example $f(1)=1$ $f(2)=1$ $f(3)=1$ ... $f(9)=1$ $f(10)=2$ $f(11)=4$ $f(12)=5$ ... $f(99)=20$ and so on. Clearly $f(1)=1$ is a fixed point. The original question was to find the next fixed point. I immediately established the recursive relation $$f(10^k-1)=10\cdot f(10^{k-1}-1)+10^{k-1}$$ with $f(9)=1$. Then I got the explicit relation $$f(10^k-1)=k\cdot 10^{k-1}.$$ So we see that after $n=1$, $f(n)<n$ until we get to $f(9,999,999,999)=10,000,000,000$ so the fixed point must be between one billion and ten billion. Then after carefully counting and keeping track of what I was doing I got the fixed point to be $$f(1,111,111,110)=1,111,111,110.$$ Now my questions are Does anyone know the origin of this problem? Like is it a Putnam/IMO/etc... challenge problem? I originally heard this problem way long ago when starting my undergrad and I just randomly remembered it again a few days ago. Is there an elegant or an easier way of doing this analytically? Since I don't know how I heard of this problem...and it is a data retrieval nightmare (like when I try to google it), I have no idea if my solution is right or not. Can someone perhaps verify it? I can't tell if I made a mistake counting or not. Is it possible to code this efficiently so that I can get an answer by a simulation? From what I remember I tried MATLAB and Mathematica but it just took so frigging long I had to kill them without knowing the answer and go back to paper and a pencil. I didn't try C++ or FORTRAN. In Mathematica I did try to ""optimize"" it as much as I could using its built-in functions but too slow. For MATLAB, I couldn't see how to vectorize it so just had to write a loop which is of course a bad idea. Any efficient algorithms? Any ideas? More of a theoretical question, is there any way to prove that another fixed after $n=1$ even exists over $\mathbb{N}$? Using the recursive relation above we see that $f(999,999,999)=900,000,000$ and $f(9,999,99,999)=10,000,000,000$ so $f(n)>n$ and then I just narrow the interval until I get $f(n)=n$. If we considered the smooth continuation of $f(x)$ over $\mathbb{R^+}$ then yes the intermediate value theorem guarantees us the fixed point ($f(x)-x$ has an $x$-intercept because it switches sign). But how do we know, how can we prove that the fixed point is EXACTLY on an integer? I mean I know the answer must exist because the question was posed but frankly I am a little surprised that there is another integer after one where the integer exactly equals the number of times ""1"" is needed to get there. 6.Can we say anything about the long term behavior of $f$? Like will $f(n)$ be always greater than $n$ after the second fixed point or will it oscillate going above and below $n$ arbitrarily many times as $n$ tends to infinity? Are there any other fixed points? Are there any other fixed points over the natural numbers? Any way to find them all? Does the smooth continuation of $f$ to the reals have a closed form expression?

Since it is a martingale, the co-variance can be calculated as: \begin{array} {lcl} E[Y_t Y_s] & = & b^2 ts + E(I(t)I(s)] \\ & = & b^2 ts + E\{(I(t)-I(s))* I(s) \} + E [I(s)^2] \\& =&b^2 ts + Var[I(s)] + b^2s^2 \\ & = & b^2 ts + b^2 s^2 + s(1-s)   \end{array} Hence the variance is just $ b^2 s^2 + s(1-s)$. However I read online, the co-variance of the Brownian Bridge should be $s(1-t)$. I am relaly confused. Please advise.

264137,Proof for an identity involving a sum of binomial coefficients,"I am moving through a On The Average Height of Planted Plane Trees by Knuth, de Bruijn and Rice, 1972), and I would like to trade a weaker result for simpler mathematical tools, because my skills are not up for the task. I would simply like to prove  that the average height $h_n$ of a tree with $n$ nodes (i.e. the maximum number of nodes from the root to a leaf) satisfies $h_n \sim \sqrt{\pi n}$. The outline from the article is as follows and may be skipped. Let $A_{nh}$ be the number of trees with height less than or equal to $h$ (with the convention $A_{nh} = A_{nn}$ for all $h \geqslant n$) and $B_{nh}$ the number of trees of $n$ nodes with height greater than or equal to $h+1$ (that is, $B_{nh} = A_{nn} - A_{nh}$). Then $h_n = S_n/A_{nn}$, where $S_n$ is the finite sum
$$
S_n = \sum_{h \geqslant 1} h(A_{nh} - A_{n,h-1}) = \sum_{h \geqslant 1} h(B_{n,h-1} - B_{nh}) = \sum_{h \geqslant 0} B_{nh}.
$$
It is well known that $A_{nn} = \frac{1}{n}\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$, for the set of general trees with $n$ nodes is in bijection with the set of binary trees with $n-1$ nodes, counted by the Catalan numbers. Thus, the first step is to find $B_{nh}$ and then the main term in the asymptotic expansion of $S_n$. At this point the authors use analytical combinatorics (three pages) to derive
$$
B_{n+1,h-1} = \sum_{k \geqslant 1} \left[\binom{2n}{n+1-kh} - 2\binom{2n}{n-kh} + \binom{2n}{n-1-kh}\right].
$$ Then they say that
$$
S_{n+1} = \sum_{k \geqslant 1}d(k) \cdot \left[\binom{2n}{n+1-k} - 2\binom{2n}{n-k} + \binom{2n}{n-1-k}\right],
$$
where $d(k)$ is the number of positive divisors of $k$. If I am not mistaken, this boils down to prove
\begin{gather*}
\sum_{h \geqslant 0}\left[\binom{2n}{(n-k)+1-kh} - 2\binom{2n}{(n-k)-kh} + \binom{2n}{(n-k)-1-kh}\right] =\\
 d(k) \cdot \left[\binom{2n}{n+1-k} - 2\binom{2n}{n - k} + \binom{2n}{n-1-k}\right].

where $\dfrac{d}{dt}\dfrac{tx}{e^{tx}-1}=\dfrac{xe^{tx}(1-tx-e^{-tx})}{(e^{tx}-1)} \leq 0$, we get
$$
\left|\int_T^\infty f(t)\dfrac{tx}{e^{tx}-1}\,dt\right| \leq 2\sup_{t\geq T}|F(t)-\ell|\dfrac{Tx}{e^{Tx}-1}\leq 2 \sup_{t\geq T}|F(t)-\ell|.
$$ Hence, for every $T > 1$ and $x >0$,
$$
\left|\int_1^\infty f(t)\dfrac{xt}{e^{xt}-1}\,dt - \ell\right| \leq \left|\int_1^T f(t)\left(1-\dfrac{xt}{e^{xt}-1}\right)\,dt\right| + 3\sup_{t\geq T}|F(t)-\ell|.

It makes intuitive sense to me, because any monotonic function $f(x)$ with a derivative that isn't monotonic results in that function increasing as $x$ increases, but the rate at which it increases is decreasing, therefore in a sense its sort of approaching a constant value, ie 'increaseing at a very slow rate', making all terms slightly less then $f(x)$ , ie $f(x-1), f(x-2),\ldots$ etc, all very close in value to $f(x)$. Meaning the summands towards the end of the summation should all be very close in value, while the smaller ones like $f(1),f(2),\ldots$ etc are neglible.

To see the normality we need to prove that given $A,B,H$ subgroups of $G$ such that $A\triangleleft B$ we have $A\cap H \triangleleft B\cap H$. So take $g\in A\cap H$ and $h\in B\cap H$ and consider $hgh^{-1}$.

The paper Asymptotic Formulae in Combinatory Analysis proves there are constants $A$,$B$ such that $e^{A\sqrt{n}} < p(n) < e^{B\sqrt{n}}$ by elementary means. Here is the argument for one side of the inequality, it is just the inductive step which I have not understood: I assume that $p_r(n)$ is defined to be $0$ for negative $n$, then the inequalty (2.22) does not hold for these $n$. In which case the sum $\{n^{s-1} + (n-s-1)^{s-1} + (n-2s-2)^{s-1} + \ldots\}$ must be finite, ending before $n-ks-k$ becomes negative. On the other hand the use of telescoping down to $n^s$ suggests that the sum is infinite, otherwise we would end up with $n^s - (n-ks-k)^{s-1}$ and are unable to throw away the $k$ term.

264324,"Why do my algebra proofs seem like ""magic""? Is this related to category theory?","$\newcommand{Ab}{\operatorname{Ab}} \newcommand{Id}{\operatorname{Id}}$I'm self-studying Introduction to Topological Manifolds by John M. Lee, which includes quite a few exercises like this: 9-4(b) Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be disjoint sets, and let $R_i$ be a subset of the free group $F(S_i)$ for $i=1,2$. Prove that $\langle S_1 \cup S_2 \mid R_1 \cup R_2 \rangle$ is a presentation of the free product group $\langle S_1 \mid R_1 \rangle * \langle S_2 \mid R_2 \rangle$. 10-17. For any groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, show that $\Ab(G_1*G_2) \cong \Ab(G_1) \oplus \Ab(G_2)$. 10-19. For any set $S$, show that the abelianization of the free group $F(S)$ is isomorphic to the free abelian group $\mathbb{Z}S$. ($*$ is free product, $\Ab$ is abelianization.) Here is my tedious proof of 10-17: For $i=1,2$, let 
  \begin{align*}
\alpha_{i}:G_{i} & \to\Ab(G_{i}),\\
\alpha:G_{1}*G_{2} & \to\Ab(G_{1}*G_{2}),\\
j_{i}:\Ab(G_{i}) & \to\Ab(G_{1})\oplus\Ab(G_{2}),\\
k_{i}:G_{i} & \to G_{1}*G_{2}
\end{align*}
   be the canonical maps. There exists a homomorphism $\ell:G_{1}*G_{2}\to\Ab(G_{1})\oplus\Ab(G_{2})$
  satisfying $\ell\circ k_{i}=j_{i}\circ\alpha_{i}$, and there exists
  a homomorphism $\varphi:\Ab(G_{1}*G_{2})\to\Ab(G_{1})\oplus\Ab(G_{2})$
  satisfying $\varphi\circ\alpha=\ell$. Also, there exist homomorphisms
  $m_{i}:\Ab(G_{i})\to\Ab(G_{1}*G_{2})$ satisfying $m_{i}\circ\alpha_{i}=\alpha\circ k_{i}$,
  so there exists a homomorphism $\psi:\Ab(G_{1})\oplus\Ab(G_{2})\to\Ab(G_{1}*G_{2})$
  satisfying $\psi\circ j_{i}=m_{i}$. Now 
  $$
\varphi\circ\psi\circ j_{i}\circ\alpha_{i}=\varphi\circ m_{i}\circ\alpha_{i}=\varphi\circ\alpha\circ k_{i}=\ell\circ k_{i}=j_{i}\circ\alpha_{i},
$$
   so $\varphi\circ\psi=\Id_{\Ab(G_{1})\oplus\Ab(G_{2})}$ by uniqueness.
  Similarly, 
  $$
\psi\circ\varphi\circ\alpha\circ k_{i}=\psi\circ\ell\circ k_{i}=\psi\circ j_{i}\circ\alpha_{i}=m_{i}\circ\alpha_{i}=\alpha\circ k_{i},

264362,Checking if a System of Polynomial Equations is Consistent,"I'm trying to determine whether any solutions exist to a system of $(n+1)$ polynomial equations in $n$ unknowns.
For example:
$$
\begin{align*}
xy&=-2\\
x^2-1&=0\\
y^3-3y^2+2y&=0
\end{align*}
$$
This is an accurate simplification of my actual system in that the first equation contains mixed terms with all variables represented and the remaining $n$ equations are univariate, and that the maximum degree of any term (say, $D$) is in the low single digits.
The actual system is very large ($n$ is $10^3$ to $10^4$), but with similar $D$.
It also typically has many terms in the first equation. In this example, the system is in fact consistent ($x=-1; y=2$).
Were the first equation altered, however, to $xy=-3$, the system would be inconsistent.
My naive approach is to find the solutions to the last $n$ equations (here $x\in\{-1,1\},y\in\{0,1,2\}$) and try all combinations thereof until one satisfies the first equation or I exhaust the combinations, but this requires roughly $D^n$ checks, which isn't feasible for large systems.
It's also not necessary to find a solution, just prove whether one exists. I've spent some time looking for appropriate algorithms, and I'll summarise my current understanding.  I don't have a very strong background in this kind of math, so please correct any misconceptions I have here. As per Wikipedia, consistency can be checked via computation of the Grobner basis.
It seems like I would need to know a priori the order $y>x$ to compute the basis, which I do not.
Also, one of the papers I read on the topic seems to indicate that this method gets exponentially slower with increasing $n$. There is a numerical method called `homotopy continuation' for finding solutions given a similar set of equations with known solutions, but since the number of solutions is unknown (which is the point after all) I couldn't see how/if I could apply it.  It involves varying a parameter $t$ from 0 to 1 and formulating the equations such that at $t=0$ you recover the known case and at $t=1$ you recover the desired case, using Newton's method.  My attempt failed because it is possible that no solutions exist for some intermediate $t$ even though the system is consistent at both $t=0$ and $t=1$. It is possible to state the equations as rational functions in a single variable using a technique called `rational univariate representation'.  I don't properly understand how to get this representation of the system other than by trial and error, although I do understand how it would allow me to determine the consistency of the system if I did find it. I believe that due to the form of the system, I won't ever have infinite solutions, but I may have more than one. I can accept having to use methods that are exponential in $D$ due to it never getting large, but not in $n$.
If a suitable algorithm to check consistency relies upon the assumption of integer solutions, I would consider that an acceptable drawback.
Can any of the above methods serve, or how else might I go about this?

In particular, I am wondering the following : if I take the square root of the covariance matrices of my gaussians, does the space become Euclidean ? I feel this should be the case as the metric $tr(XY)$ for $X$ and $Y$ two symmetric matrices allow to recover than $\frac{d}{dt}\langle\dot\gamma,\dot\gamma\rangle=0$ if $\gamma^2$ is a geodesic in the space of covariance matrices (if $\gamma^2(t)$ is a geodesic, it can be written $\gamma(t)=A+tT$, so differentiating by $T$ gives the tangent vector which is independant of the time). However, if this space was Euclidean, wouldn't it mean that an interpolation between a covariance matrix $V$ and another covariance matrix $U$ necessarily be given by $C(t) = (V^{\frac{1}{2}} + t (U^{\frac{1}{2}}-V^{\frac{1}{2}}))^2$ ? This is not the case as geodesics are given by $C(t) = (V^{\frac{1}{2}}+t(U^{\frac{1}{2}}(U^{\frac{1}{2}}VU^{\frac{1}{2}})^{-\frac{1}{2}}U^{\frac{1}{2}}V^{\frac{1}{2}} - V^{\frac{1}{2}}))^2$ (except in 1D where these are equivalent) In which space is the metric $g_V(X,Y)=tr(XVY)$ used ? I thought it was directly in the space of covariance matrices but this doesn't seem to be the case. For instance $\frac{d}{dt}g(\dot\gamma,\dot\gamma)\neq0$ : if $\gamma$ is a geodesic in the space of covariance matrices, then $\gamma(t) = (A+tT)^2$ and then $\dot\gamma = TA+AT+2tTT$ and $\frac{d}{dt}g(\dot\gamma,\dot\gamma)\neq 0$ Thanks!","['statistics', 'information-theory', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

How do I find the 3D coordinate on the surface of that celestial sphere with the information above? I already know how to find coordinates on a normal sphere by converting to spherical coordinates, I've asked that before, but now I need to be able to do it with the celestial coordinate system (so with azimuth and altitude). My attempt which still doesn't produce good results
(the x,y,z variables are the new coordinates on the sphere's surface. rotation.x = altitude angle, rotation.y = azimuth angle) x=origin.x+radius*cos(rotation.y)*cos(rotation.x)
y=origin.y+radius*sin(rotation.x)
z=origin.z+radius*sin(rotation.y)*cos(rotation.x) These formula's are supposed to work with my 3D camera, which contains an azimuth angle, an altitude angle and a 3D position (the origin). I want a 3D coordinate to be projected a distance (radius) away from the origin. So even when all camera angles are changing constantly, the coordinate changes too but it should look like it's not moving and stay still when looking at your screen. So the point is like rotating with your camera, that's why I thought of an imaginary sphere around my camera to represent the orbit the point falls on. Maybe my whole sphere concept is wrong, I have no idea, but it's just my way to visualize the problem. Please tell me how I could visualize it differently if I'm wrong.
Maybe I could rephrase the question as: ""how to find the point at the end of a 3D vector"",
so I got a vector with a 3D position, direction (azimuth and altitude, if that's even possible) and a length (the ""radius""). Am I thinking too complicated? My formulas ONLY work if you fill in the camera's angles (so then the point is in the centre of your screen), but it doesn't work when I add an offset to the angles (like: cos(camera_angle.x+OFFSET), then the point's position isn't right anymore at all. If for example the camera is looking in front towards the horizon, the altitude angle is 0°. when looking down towards the ground, it's -90° (or 270°). When looking up it's +90°. The azimuth angle has a range from 0-360°. 
I need to get the right combination of multiplying sin and cos together in order to get the new coordinate on the sphere. But my formulas give me the wrong location of the point.
Please help and ask me more details if you need them.","['trigonometry', 'spherical-coordinates']"
264688,Interpreting a limit as a derivative,"I am being stumped by the following question: Evaluate the limit by interpreting each as a derivative: $$\lim_{x\,\to\tfrac{\pi}{6}} \frac{\cos(2x) - \frac{1}{2}}{x - \frac{\pi}{6}}$$ The only way I can think to solve this is using L'Hopital's rule. I have done that and got the correct answer $-\sqrt{3}$. But, I can not figure out how to do it the was it is described. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","['calculus', 'limits']"
264698,asymptotics of the expected number of edges of a random acyclic digraph with indegree and outdegree at most one,"A recent discussion, which may be found here , examined the problem of counting the number of acyclic digraphs on $n$ labelled nodes and having $k$ edges and indegree and outdegree at most one. It was established that the bivariate mixed generating function of this class $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs on $n$ nodes and with $k$ edges is
$$ G(z, u) = \exp \left(\frac{z}{1-uz} \right).$$
This immediately implies that the expected number of edges of a random graph from $\mathcal{G}$ is
$$\epsilon_n = [z^n]\left. \frac{d}{du} G(z,u) \right|_{u=1}.$$
Evaluating this quantity we obtain
$$ \left. \exp \left(\frac{z}{1-uz} \right) z (-1)\frac{1}{(1-uz)^2} (-z)\right|_{u=1}
= \left. \exp \left(\frac{z}{1-uz} \right) \frac{z^2}{(1-uz)^2} \right|_{u=1}
= \exp \left(\frac{z}{1-z}\right) \left(\frac{z}{1-z}\right)^2$$
Continuing with this calculation we find
$$ \epsilon_n = [z^n] \sum_{m\ge 0} \frac{1}{m!}  \left(\frac{z}{1-z}\right)^{m+2} =
\sum_{m=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{m!} [z^n]  \left(\frac{z}{1-z}\right)^{m+2} =
\sum_{m=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{m!} [z^{n-m-2}] \left(\frac{1}{1-z}\right)^{m+2} =
\sum_{m=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{m!} \binom{n-m-2+m+1}{m+1} =
\sum_{m=0}^{n-2} \frac{1}{m!} \binom{n-1}{m+1}.$$
This closed form is actually quite nice, but it does not answer the question that is the most obvious one for this problem, namely Is there an asymptotic expansion of $\epsilon_n$ and if yes, what is the first term?","['graph-theory', 'random-graphs', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

Fisher's argument of getting the subsequence of $f_n$ which converges a.e, and finiteness of space give you a. uniform by Egoroff). But that way I can only show result will be good for the case of subsequence.

To solve this equation I tried the Froebenius method (it didn't work), and the Maple software (it didn't work either). The group has found a numerical solution using the Runge-Kunta method, but it's necessary to have an analytical or semi-analytical solution to comprehend the real influence of spin-orbit interaction in graphene. I would like to add that this is not homework. In fact, this is an ongoing work with my adviser and after more than one month trying to obtain this solution I decided that I should ask for some help.
