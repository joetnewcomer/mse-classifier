1597563,Continuous map and irrational numbers,"My question is the following : Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous map such as each irrational number is mapped to a rational number (i.e. $f(\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q})\subset\mathbb{Q}$). Show that $f$ is a constant map. What I have done : Let's suppose that $f$ is not a constant map, i.e. it exists $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)\neq f(y).$ As $f$ is continuous, the intermediate value theorem gives us that $[f(x),f(y)]\subset f([x,y]).$ But, as $$f([x,y])\subset f(\mathbb{R})=f(\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}\,\cup\,\mathbb{Q})=f(\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q})\,\cup\,\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\{f(p_n)\}\subset\mathbb{Q}\,\cup\,\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\{f(p_n)\},$$ where $p_n$ is a sequence which describes $\mathbb{Q},$ we would get that $[f(x),f(y)]$ is a subset of a countable set and so is countable, which is a contradiction and so $f$ is constant.

I have to show that $S_n/\sqrt n$ does not converge in probability. Here's what I did. Since $S_n/\sqrt n$ converges in distribution to a normal random variable $Z$ with mean zero, if $S_n/\sqrt n$ converges in probability at all it must be to $Z$. But $$P(|\frac {S_n} {\sqrt n} - Z| > \epsilon) \geq P(|\frac {S_n} {\sqrt n}|<\epsilon, |Z|>2\epsilon)$$ Now I get to the main point I'm not sure of. Can I say that the random variables $S_n\sqrt n$ (for any $n$) and $Z$ are independant? It seems like they might be, since in some sense we can't tell what the limit of a sequence will be from any initial segment of it. If so, then I can continue (this all seems correct to me) $$\begin{align}

Prove or disprove the following: If $S$ has ""Property 1"", then $\exists$ $S' \subseteq S$ such that $S'$ has ""Property 1"" and $\forall$ $C \subseteq S'$, $C \neq \emptyset$, $S'-C$ does not have ""Property 1.""

1597802,Help to understand a Lemma about 'supremum of a family of measures',"I read the following Lemma from a paper but I can't understand the proof. Please help! Lemma: Let $\mu$ be a positive measure defined on the family of open
  subsets of $\Omega$, which is super-additive on open sets with
  disjoint compact closure. (Here $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^N$ is open
  bounded with Lip boundary). Let $\lambda$ be a positive measure on
  $\Omega$, let $\phi_i$ be positive Borel functions such that
  $\mu(A)\geq \int_A \phi_i d\lambda$ for all open sets $A$ and let
  $\phi(x)=\sup_i \phi_i(x)$.  Then $\mu(A)\geq \int_A\phi d\lambda$ for
  all open sets $A$. and here is the proof. It is short. Proof: By the regularity of the measures $\phi_i\lambda$,
  \begin{align*}
\int_A \phi d\lambda &= \sup\left\{\sum_{i=1}^k\int_{B_i}\phi_i d\lambda:\,(B_i)\text{ Borel partition of }A,\,k\in \mathbb N\right\}\\

For example, using coordinates $[x_0:x_1:x_2:x_3]$ for $\mathbb{P}^3$, let $\ell$ be the line given by $x_0 = x_1 = 0$. The book says that the lines disjoint from $\ell$ are given by $\langle (1,0,a,b), (0,1,c,d) \rangle$. I can see that $\ell$ corresponds to $\langle (0,0,1,0),(0,0,0,1) \rangle$ and I've tried showing that, given a subspace $\langle (a,b,c,d),(e,f,g,h) \rangle$, there is no non-trivial linear combination of $(a,b,c,d)$ and $(e,f,g,h)$ that is of the form $(0,0,\alpha,\beta)$, but I end up having to check a few cases and it's definitely not straightforward. The book goes on to compute the general form of elements of the Schubert cycle $\sigma_1(L) = \{\ell \in G(2,4) \mid \ell \cap L \neq \emptyset\}$, which apparently is given by $\langle (1,a,0,b),(0,0,1,c) \rangle$. How so? Again this is me encountering difficulties working with the projectivization of subspaces, so a few tips would be much appreciated.

1597880,Can the theorem on semi-continuity of fiber dimension be explained as a semi-continuity of rank of a quasi-coherent sheaf?,"Here are two theorems: If $F$ is a finite type quasi-coherent sheaf on a scheme $X$ , then $ \operatorname{rank}(F)(p) = \dim_{k(p)} F_p \otimes_{O_p} k(p)$ is a upper semicontinuous function on $X$ . If $\pi : X \to Y$ is a closed morphism of finite type $k$ schemes, then the dimension of the fiber over $q \in Y$ is an upper semicontinuous function on $Y$ . (Also, the dimension of the largest component of the fiber containing $P \in X$ is an upper semicontinuous function on X.) Are these related? For a finite type sheaf $F$ on a reduced scheme X, it looks like a vector bundle on each of the locally closed subsets given by $\operatorname{rank} F = k$ for $k$ varying. So in this case my guess would be that there is a total space over $X$ for which $F$ is the sheaf of sections and the two theorems — in the case of a finite type reduced $k$ -scheme — are saying the same thing here. When is there a reasonable total space for a quasicoherent sheaf? (The étale space is not reasonable — it is way to big.) Are they both special cases of something more general?

The reasoning behind that is that I want to have the blue side as high as possible (to make the $x$ as low as possible) and the yellow side as wide as possible (for the same reason). I didn't divide the square into rectangles with infinitely small height or width, because no matter how small they are, they eventually add up and form the two big rectangles that are on my picture.

(ii) For each $p\in M$, there exist a neighbourhood $U$ of $p$ in $M$ and a homeomorphism $\Phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times\Bbb{R}^k$ (called a local trivialization of $E$ over $U$* ), satisfying the following conditions: $\pi_U\circ\Phi=\pi$ (where $\pi_U:U\times\Bbb{R}^k\to U$ is the projection); for each $q\in U$, the restriction of $\Phi$ to $E_q$ is a vector space isomorphism from $E_q$ to $\{q\}\times\Bbb{R}^k\cong\Bbb{R}^k$.

Pour out $c^3(1-c)$ liters of water from the jugs labeled $\{1,2,3\}$ and $\{4\}$. (Note that $c^3(1-c)\le c(1-c)^3$, so we can do this.) Similarly with $\{1,2,4\}$ and $\{3\}$, $\{1,3,4\}$ and $\{2\}$, and $\{2,3,4\}$ and $\{1\}$. Pour out $c(1-c)^3-c^3(1-c)=c(1-c)(1-2c)$ liters of water from the jugs labeled $\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{4\}$. Pour out $c^2(1-c)^2$ liters of water from the jugs labeled $\{1,2\}$ and $\{3,4\}$. Similarly with $\{1,3\}$ and $\{2,4\}$, and $\{1,4\}$ and $\{2,3\}$. In general, we can empty a jug whose label has size at least $n/2$ by pairing it with its complement, but how can we make sure we empty the jugs with label of size less than $n/2$? For small enough $c$ (in terms of $n$) this can be done by using the singletons to empty everything else. If we were to allow $c$ to be as high as close to $1/2$, this question/answer shows that the task is not possible.",['combinatorics']

1598721,Global Lyapunov function. Definition,"Our definition of a global Lyapunov function for a system $\dot{x}=f(x)$ is the following: Let a smooth scalar function $V\colon R^n\to R^1$ have the two following properties: $V(x)\to +\infty$ as $\lVert x\rVert\to+ +\infty$ and for all $x$ which are not equilibria of the system (i.e. $f(x)\neq 0$) there exists an $m$ such that
$$
\frac{d^m}{dt^m}V(x) <0\text{ and }\frac{d^j}{dt^j}V(x)=0\text{ if }1\leq j <m.
$$
Then we call $V$ a global Lyapunov function of the system. For example, we had that an Hamiltonian can be a global Lyapunov function if $H(x,y)\to +\infty$ as $\lVert y\rVert +\lVert x\rVert \to\infty$ and, except for the equilibria of the associated system, for each x there is some $m$  with the property above. My questions are: (1) Why $V(x,y)\to\infty$ as $\lVert x\rVert +\lVert y\rVert\to +\infty$ and not as $\lVert (x,y)\rVert\to +\infty$? Or is this just the same? (2) What if we have $V(x)\to -\infty$ as $\lVert x\rVert\to +\infty$? Is this still okay? For example consider the Hamiltonian $H(x,y)=\frac{y^2}{2}-\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{x^3}{3}$. Then we have $H(x,y)\to -\infty$ as $\lVert x\rVert +\lVert y\rVert\to +\infty$. So the first condition is not fulfilled. But the second condition is fulfilled. Nonetheless we said $H$ is a global Lyapunov function. So does it play no role whether $H(x,y)\to +\infty$ or $H(x,y)\to -\infty$ as $\lVert x\rVert +\lVert y\rVert\to +\infty$?",['ordinary-differential-equations']

Let $f: \beta \to \alpha$ be an isomorphism. We consider $f(\alpha)$. Because the range of $f$ is $\alpha$, we have $f(\alpha) < \alpha$. Because $f$ is an isomorphism, it is order preserving, so $f^2(\alpha) < f(\alpha)$. Hence $f^{n+1}(\alpha) < f^n(\alpha)$ for all $n$. So $\{f^n(\alpha): n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a strictly decreasing sequence in a well-ordered set. This is impossible, so we get the desired contradiction.

If that one gets answered, I'll probably accept the answer given below (although I'm uncertain of whether or not this is the community standard; if you know, please let me know). I've found a sequence $x_{i+1}=\|x_i(2+k)\|$, where $k=1+2\sqrt{2}$ and where $||a||$ rounds $a$ to the nearest integer, that seems to minimize the distance $P_n$ to an integer solution (for $x$ and $y$) of the equation in the title. $P_n$ is more rigorously defined as the absolute value of $\|y_n\|-y_n$, where $y_n=nk$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Starting with $x_0=1$ the sequence becomes $x_1=\|2+k\|=\|5.83\ldots\|=6,x_2=\|6(2+k)\|=\|34.97\ldots\|=35,204,1189,6930,\ldots$ where $P_i$ very quickly becomes small. In Fig. 1 below, I've plotted $P_n$ for $n$. In Fig. 2 only low values of $P$ is shown and it seems that the $P_i$'s from the sequence (in red) are the lowest value up until that $n$ (I've checked this up to $n=10^6$). My main question is this: Why does this sequence give the solutions nearest integer-solutions? (Edit for further clarification:) And why are these the nearest up until that point (see Fig. 2)? Can it be proven, starting from the original equation, that the elements in this sequence will give the best approximations to integers up until that point, e.g. that it's error dies off faster than all other possible sequences?

This bothers me. As I should be able to do it as I see fit. I will post my work and someone point out the problem in my work. The matrix is as follows: $$A = \left(
        \begin{matrix}
        5&-7&2&2\\
        0&3&0&-4\\
        -5&-8&0&3\\
        0&5&0&-6\\
        \end{matrix} \right)
$$ I decided to expand across row one and cross out columns as I found the minors. For the first minor obtaining:
$$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        3 & 0 & -4 \\
        -8 & 0 & 3 \\
        5 & 0 & -6 \\
        \end{pmatrix} 
$$ M1 being row one column one we attain $-1^2 = 1$. This is to be multiplied by the determinate of the minor. Now finding the determinant I did: 3 times $$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 3 \\
        0 & -6  \\
        \end{pmatrix}
$$ 
giving $3(0-0)= 0$ 
then: 0 times $$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        -8 & 3\\
         5 & -6\\
        \end{pmatrix}
$$ giving 0(48-15)=0 Then:
4 times
$$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        -8 & 0 \\
         5 & 0 \\
        \end{pmatrix}
$$
giving $4(0-0)=0$
adding the determinants we get $0+0+0=0$ 
So det M1 $= 0(1) = 0$ M2--> M(1,2)---> $-1^1+2= -1^3 = -1$ $$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 0 & -4 \\
        -5 & 0 & 3 \\
        0 & 0 & -6 \\
        \end{pmatrix}
$$ o* 
$$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 3 \\
        0 & -6 \\
        \end{pmatrix}
$$
giving $0(0-0)=0$ obviously the next matrix will look the same as the top term in column two is a zero so the determinant for that will be $0$. Now finally 4 times
$$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        -8 & 0 \\
        5 & 0 \\
       \end{pmatrix}
$$
giving 4(0-0)= 0 So the Determinant of Minor 2 is (0+0+0)(-1)= 0 Now on to Minor number 3 M3 --> $-1^4 = 1$ $$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 3 & -4 \\
        -5 & -8 & 3 \\
        0 & 5 & -6 \\
        \end{pmatrix}
$$ for the determinant: 0 times
$$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        -8 & 3 \\
         5 & -6 \\
        \end{pmatrix}
$$
which gives $0(48-15)=0$ -3 times
$$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        -5& 3 \\
        0 & -6 \\  
        \end{pmatrix}
$$ which gives $-3(30-0)= -90$ it is redundant to go on from here because after the final computation for this minor I get -100 and as a result get det M3 = -190 and get determinant of zeros for the following determinant of M4. 
which gives: $0(5)+ 0(-7) + (-90)(2) + (0)(2)$ giving 
Det Ax $= -380.$ The book says its $20$ and when I did it in a calculator it got 20 but the problem is that both the book and calculator expand across the row with the most zeros but theoretically speaking NO MATTER WHICH row or column you choose to expand across you should get the same answer. So what is it? Is my computation wrong or is my assumption that you can expand across any row or column wrong? Isn't it only important if the determinant doesn't equal zero? or does the exact value matter in more advanced cases?",['linear-algebra']
1599089,The smallest symmetric group $S_m$ into which a given dihedral group $D_{2n}$ embeds,"Several questions, both here and on MathOverflow , address the issue of determining for a given group $G$ the smallest integer $\mu(G)$ for which there is an embedding (injective homomorphism) $G \hookrightarrow S_{\mu(G)}$. In general this is a difficult problem, but it's not hard to resolve the question for $G$ of small order , and $\mu(G)$ has been determined for some important classes of groups $G$. For example, for $G$ abelian, so that we can write $G$ uniquely (up to reordering) as $\Bbb Z_{a_1} \times \cdots \times \Bbb Z_{a_r}$ for (nontrivial) prime powers $a_1, \ldots, a_r$,
$$\mu(G) = a_1 + \cdots + a_r .$$ And of course, $\mu(S_m) = m$. I have not been able to find, however, where this has been resolved for the dihedral groups; my question is: For each dihedral group $D_{2n}$ (of order $2 n$), what is the smallest symmetric group into which $D_{2n}$ embeds, that is, what is $\mu_n := \mu(D_{2n})$? Of course, $D_2 \cong S_2$ and $D_6 \cong S_3$, and so $\mu_1 = 2$ and $\mu_3 = 3$; also, $D_4 \cong \Bbb Z_2 \times \Bbb Z_2$, so by the above result $\mu_2 = \mu(D_4) = 4$. For any group $G$ and subgroup $H \leq G$, an embedding $G \hookrightarrow S_m$ determines an embedding $H \hookrightarrow S_m$, and so $\mu(H) \leq \mu(G)$. Thus, since $D_{2n} \cong \Bbb Z_n \rtimes \Bbb Z_2$, we have $\mu_n = \mu(D_{2n}) \geq \mu(\Bbb Z_n)$, which by the above is the sum $\Sigma_n$ of the prime powers in the prime factorization of $n$. On the other hand, for $n > 2$, the usual action by rotations and reflections of $D_{2n}$ on an $n$-gon is faithful and so determines an embedding $D_{2n} \hookrightarrow S_n$; in particular, this gives the upper bound $\mu_n \leq n$. Already, these bounds together give $\mu_4 = 4$ (realized by the embedding of the symmetry group of the square into the symmetric group on its vertices) and more generally that $\mu_a = a$ for prime powers $a > 2$. This is not sufficient, however, to determine $\mu_n$ for other integers $> 5$; for example, $\mu(\Bbb Z_6) = 5$, so these bounds only give $5 \leq \mu_6 \leq 6$. It turns out that $D_{12}$ can be embedded in $S_5$ (as David points out in a comment under his question, this embedding can be realized explicitly as $\langle(12)(345), (12)(34)\rangle$), and this settles $\mu_6 = 5$. The above results together determine the subsequence $$(\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_9) = (2, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9) ,$$ which in particular does not appear in the OEIS . Edit Per David's answer, the sequence $(\mu_n)$ appears to be given by
$$
\mu_n := \left\{\begin{array}{cl}2, & n = 1\\ 4, & n = 2\\ \Sigma_n, & n > 2 \end{array}\right. ,
$$
and $(\Sigma_n)$ itself appears in the OEIS as sequence A008475 .","['finite-groups', 'group-homomorphism', 'dihedral-groups', 'group-theory']"
1599104,The significance of the composition of an operator and its adjoint,"As I read the literature, I have noticed that the composition $T^*T$ of a linear operator $T:H\to H$ and its adjoint frequently turns up in all kind of places. I am aware that it is Hermitian (at least when $T$ is bounded), that $||Tx||^2=\langle Tx,Tx\rangle=\langle x,T^*Tx\rangle$ and other basic stuff like that. However, I don't quite ""feel"" what the notion $T^*T$ really is and why is it so ubiquitous. I know that this might seem vague but can anyone give me a general idea of how I should view $T^*T$? What dose it do to a vector and what are its important properties? I am particularly struck by the fact that $||A||_2^2=\rho(A^*A)$ when $A$ is a matrix representing a finite dimensional operator and that $I+T^*T$ is a bijection.","['functional-analysis', 'linear-algebra', 'soft-question', 'motivation']"

1599119,"$S_5$ does not act transitively on $\{1,2,3\}$?","I have seen a statement: let $S_n$ act transitively on a set with $m$ elements. Then, $m\leq 2$ or $n \leq m$. I was able to prove it, so I believe it. However, I find this strikingly unintuitive. For instance, $S_5$ contains $S_3$, which acts transitively on $\{1,2,3\}$, so shouldn't $S_5$ also act transitively? Where is the gap in my logic here? $\textbf{Edit:}$ Can someone give me an example of a non-trivial action of $S_5$ on $\{1,2,3\}$ that is not transitive?","['finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

1599159,Limit with the Appell F1 function,"While attempting to solve this problem I ran into a nasty limit. Mathematica claims that the indefinite integral $$\int\left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b}(z^2)^{n/4}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b\cos^2\theta}(R^2+z^2)^{n/4}}\right]\,dz
$$ where $$\cos\theta = \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2+R^2}}$$ is equal to $$-\frac{z \left(R^2+z^2\right)^{-\frac{n}{4}} \left(\frac{z^2}{R^2}+1\right)^{\frac{n+2}{4}} \sqrt{\frac{a \left(R^2+z^2\right)+b z^2}{R^2+z^2}}}{a (a+b) \sqrt{\frac{z^2 (a+b)}{a R^2}+1}}-\frac{2 z \left(z^2\right)^{-\frac{n}{4}}}{(n-2) \sqrt{a+b}}\cdot\left[b F_1\left(\frac{1}{2};\frac{n+2}{4},\frac{1}{2};\frac{3}{2};-\frac{z^2}{R^2},-\frac{(a+b) z^2}{a R^2}\right)+a F_1\left(\frac{1}{2};\frac{n+2}{4},-\frac{1}{2};\frac{3}{2};-\frac{z^2}{R^2},-\frac{(a+b) z^2}{a R^2}\right)\right]$$ With the restrictions $a>0$, $b>0$, $0<n<2$ and $R\ll 1$. We want the definite integral from $-\infty $ to $\infty$ and because the function is even we can take the difference of the limits at infinity and $0$. Mathematica evaluates to limit at $0$ to be equal to zero but isn't able to evaluate the upper limit. In an effort to make the arguments of the Appell functions converge to something I applied the following transformation ( citation ) $$F_1\left(a;b_1,b_2;c;z_1,z_2\right)\to\left(1-z_1\right){}^{-b_1} \left(1-z_2\right){}^{-b_2} F_1\left(c-a;b_1,b_2;c;\frac{z_1}{z_1-1},\frac{z_2}{z_2-1}\right)$$ Which simplifies to $$\lim_{z\to\infty}z\left(\frac{\left(R^2+z^2\right)^{-\frac{n}{4}} \sqrt{a+\frac{b z^2}{R^2+z^2}}}{(a+b) \left(z^2 (a+b)+a R^2\right)}+\frac{2 \left(z^2\right)^{-\frac{n}{4}}}{(n-2) \sqrt{a+b}}\left[b R^2 F_1\left(1;\frac{n+2}{4},\frac{1}{2};\frac{3}{2};\frac{z^2}{R^2+z^2},\frac{(a+b) z^2}{a R^2+(a+b) z^2}\right)+\left(z^2 (a+b)+a R^2\right) F_1\left(1;\frac{n+2}{4},-\frac{1}{2};\frac{3}{2};\frac{z^2}{R^2+z^2},\frac{(a+b) z^2}{a R^2+(a+b) z^2}\right)\right]\right)$$ The arguments now converge to 1, but mathematica claims that the limit is complex infinity which I know not to be true because the integral converges for the special cases that I have tried numerically. Where is my mistake? The transformation seems valid because the only restriction is that $$z_1, z_2\not\in(1, \infty)$$ which is clearly the case. Do I need more restrictions to ensure convergence? Edit: Using the comment from Pierpaolo Vivo the limit in question becomes $$\lim_{\zeta\to\infty}\left[\frac{\zeta  \sqrt{\frac{\zeta ^2}{\alpha ^2}+1}}{\sqrt{\alpha ^2+\zeta ^2}}+\frac{2 \zeta ^{1-\frac{n}{2}}}{n-2}F_1\left(\frac{1}{2};\frac{n-2}{4},\frac{1}{2};\frac{3}{2};-\zeta ^2,-\frac{\zeta ^2}{\alpha ^2}\right)\right]$$ When I apply the same transformation as above we obtain $$F_1\left(\frac{1}{2};\frac{n-2}{4},\frac{1}{2};\frac{3}{2};-\zeta ^2,-\frac{\zeta ^2}{\alpha ^2}\right)=\frac{\left(\zeta ^2+1\right)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{n}{4}}}{\sqrt{\frac{\zeta ^2}{\alpha ^2}+1}}F_1\left(1;\frac{n-2}{4},\frac{1}{2};\frac{3}{2};\frac{\zeta ^2}{\zeta ^2+1},\frac{\zeta ^2}{\alpha ^2+\zeta ^2}\right)$$ The limit now becomes $$\lim_{\zeta\to\infty}\left[\zeta  \left(\frac{\left(\zeta ^2+1\right)^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{n}{4}} F_1\left(1;\frac{n-2}{4},\frac{1}{2};\frac{3}{2};\frac{\zeta ^2}{\zeta ^2+1},\frac{\zeta ^2}{\alpha ^2+\zeta ^2}\right)}{\sqrt{\alpha ^2+\zeta ^2}}+\frac{2 \zeta ^{-\frac{n}{2}}}{n-2}\right)\right]$$ Now mathematica evaluates the limit to be $0$ at both end points..... I feel like there has to be something flawed with these transformations but all the given criteria are met.

1599163,Sequence related to solutions of the equation $x^x=c$,"A couple years ago I remember repeatedly pressing $\sqrt{1+ans}$ into my calculator to be astonished that my calculator gives me an answer approaching the golden ratio. I was astonished, and dug deeper into this problem. I realized that the limit of the sequence given by the recurrence: $$f(x_n)=x_{n+1}$$ Is, if the limit exists, a solution to: $$f(x)=x$$ And applying this I realized I could solve almost every algebra problem. So here was one that I came across: $$x^x=c$$ Easily such equation can be rearranged as: $$x=\sqrt[x]{c}$$ Where now the problem becomes finding the limit of the sequence: $$x_{n+1}=\sqrt[x_n]{c}$$ This method worked for some $c$ and $x_1$ like $c=2$ and $x_1=1.5$. But the problem is for some $c$ the sequence seems to alternate according to my observations, like $c=100$ (I tried $x_1=3.5$ and others but it doesn't seem to matter as long as it is positive). I ask anyone if they can help me figure out for what $c$ will this sequence converge for every given $x_1>0$.","['lambert-w', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"
