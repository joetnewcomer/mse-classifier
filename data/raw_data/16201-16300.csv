131041,Generate the outcome of the flip of a fair coin (A question from A First Course In Probability by Ross),"The book asks the question: Suppose that we want to generate the outcome
  of the flip of a fair coin, but that all we have at
  our disposal is a biased coin which lands on heads
  with some unknown probability p that need not be
  equal to 0.5. Could we use the procedure that continues
  to flip the coin until the last two flips are
  different and then lets the result be the outcome
  of the final flip to generate the outcome of the flip of a fair coin ? An analysis made showed that the probability of answering H is $p(1-p)$ [this is since the only case that answers H is the case that the curent flip is H and the previews flip is T]. the same argument shows that the probability of answering T is also $p(1-p)$. I have 2 questions: Why, even if $p=0.5$ we get the conclusion that the probability of answering H is not 0.5 ? [I know $p(1-p) \not=0.5 $ for any real p, but what is the reason intuitivly ? My intuition  sais that by symmetry the answer is 0.5] How is it possible that we got $P(H)+P(T)\not=1$ ?","['probability-theory', 'probability']"
131050,Number of positive integral solutions of equation $\dfrac 1 x+ \dfrac 1 y= \dfrac 1 {n!}$,"$$\dfrac 1 x+ \dfrac 1 y= \dfrac 1 {n!}$$ This is one of the popular equation to find out the number of solutions. From Google, here I found that for equation $\dfrac 1 x+ \dfrac 1 y= \dfrac 1 {n!}$, number of solutions are $\psi(n)=\text{number of divisors of } n$. $$\frac{\psi(n^2)+1}{2}$$ but when i turned here , it says that for equation $\dfrac 1 x+ \dfrac 1 y= \dfrac 1 {n!}$, number of solutions are 
$$\frac{\psi(n!^2)-1}{2}$$ However in the first link they explained the equation for $n=4$ and their formula correctly suits on that. But I want to confirm the correct answer. If there exist any better way to get the number of positive integral solutions for the equation $\dfrac 1 x+ \dfrac 1 y= \dfrac 1 {n!}$, then please suggest me. Would prime factorization help here? I have an algorithm to find out prime factors of any number. But not have any exact idea about implementing it over here. My objective is to find out total number of positive integral solutions of the equation $\dfrac 1 x+ \dfrac 1 y= \dfrac 1 {n!}$. Thank you.","['diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"

131080,"What is a ""normal value"", and why do I need it to slice a pie?","I am working on a Pie Chart, and am using a tutorial that states… An easy way to get the relative value is to normalize the array and use the normal value [0, 1] to arrive at the angle of the slice, ie. normal * 2 * M_PI . For example, if the normal value is 0.5 , the angle of the slice will be M_PI or 180° . What do they mean, by normal ? Ok, so I looked it up (hey, I got a 5 on the Calculus AP, but that was a long time ago ).. and realize now that to normalize means to multiply (a series, function, or item of data) by a factor that makes the norm or some associated quantity such as an integral equal to a desired value (usually 1).

I would like to make a change of variable, say, $t = \sqrt{x \sin x}$, to get a $t^3$ in the denominator.  Unfortunately, that leaves me with problems in the numerator.

131151,"Cohesive picture of groups, rings, fields, modules and vector spaces.","If I understand my algebra correctly every field is a ring and every ring is a group, so when we define modules over rings and vector spaces over fields, we then have that every vector space is a module? A linear algebra is defined in Hoffman's book as follows. Let $F$ be a field. A linear algebra over the field $F$ is a vector space $\mathcal{A}$ over $F$ with an additional operation called multiplication of vectors which assosciates with each pair of vectors $\alpha, \beta \in \mathcal{A}$ a vector $\alpha \beta \in \mathcal{A}$ called the product in such a way that, Multiplication is associative: $\alpha (\beta \gamma) = (\alpha \beta) \gamma$ Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition: $\alpha(\beta + \gamma) = \alpha \beta + \alpha \gamma$ and $(\alpha + \beta)\gamma = \alpha \gamma + \beta \gamma$ For each scalar c in $F$: $c(\alpha \beta) = (c \alpha)\beta = \alpha(c \beta)$ Is there a more recent term for what Hoffman means by a linear algebra and how does it fit into the whole group-ring-field hierarchy?

131238,A procedure for sampling from a bag (A question from A First Course In Probability by Ross),"The book asks the question: A bag contains $a$ white and $b$ black balls. Balls
are chosen from the bag according to the following
method: A ball is chosen at random and is discarded. A second ball is then chosen. If its color is
different from that of the preceding ball, it is
replaced in the bag and the process is repeated
from the beginning. If its color is the same, it is
discarded and we start from step 2. In other words, balls are sampled and discarded until a change in
color occurs, at which point the last ball is returned to the urn and
the process starts anew. Let $P_{a,b}$ denote the probability that the last
ball in the bag is white. Prove that $P_{a,b}=0.5$ Hint: Use induction on $k=a+b$ . I tried doing this and got : Denote the probability that in step 2 the 2 balls were in the same color by $p$ , then with probability $p$ we are returning to step 1 with $k-2$ balls and with probability $1-p$ we are returning to step 1 with $k-1$ .

Long Question : Question: Take a planet of mass $M$ and place a satellite at rest at a distance $R$ from the planet, where $R$ is much greater than the planet's radius.  How long does the satellite take to hit the surface of the planet? Part 1 of the question asks the reader to perform dimensional analysis.  This yields $$\textrm{Time taken }T=C\sqrt{\frac{R^3}{GM}}$$ Part 2 - integrate the equation of motion of the satellite to show that $C=\pi /2\sqrt{2}$. As far as I'm aware, the equation of motion for the satellite is $$\ddot{r}=-\frac{GM}{r^2}.$$ I've tried solving this differential equation, but to no avail ($r=\frac{9}{2}GMt^{\frac{2}{3}}$ is a particular solution, but I have no idea how to find the more general case; substituting the dimensionless quantity $\kappa=\frac{1}{GM}r^3t^{-2}$ almost worked but not quite).  I also tried using the potential $V=\frac{-GMm}{r}$ to form the equation $$T=\int_R^0{\frac{dr}{2\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}-\frac{GM}{R}}}}.$$ However, this integral doesn't look as if it's going to give the right answer.

In the first chapter he writes: If $x$ belongs to $A$ ($x$ is an element of $A$, $x$ is contained in $A$), we shall write $x\in A$ I understand this. Then, he write: If $A$ and $B$ are sets and if every element of $A$ is an element of $B$, we say that $A$ is a subset of $B$, or $B$ includes $A$, and we write: $A \subset B$ I understand this too. Then he says: The working of the definition implies that each set must be considered to be included in itself ($A \subset A$); this fact is described by saying that set inclusion is reflexive . I understand this too. But then: Observe that belonging ($\in$) and inclusion ($\subset$) are conceptually very different things indeed. One important difference has already manifested itself above: inclusion is always reflexive, whereas it is not at all clear that belonging is ever reflexive. That is: $A \subset A$ is always true;  is $A\in A$ ever true? It is certainly not true of any reasonable set that anyone has ever seen. And this is where I don't think I understand anything.

131330,Detecting perfect squares faster than by extracting square root,"Given the radix-$r$ representation of a integer $n$, and a small integer constant $k$, there is an $O(\log n)$ algorithm for detecting whether $n$ is a multiple of $k$, namely, division, which produces as a byproduct the quotient $\lfloor n/k\rfloor$.  In general this is the best one can do. But for certain choices of $r$ and $k$, for example $r=10$ and $k=2$, there is an algorithm which answers the question much faster (constant time) without producing the quotient. Given the radix-$r$ representation of a integer $n$, we can extract the integer square root $\lfloor\sqrt n\rfloor$ in something like $O(\log^3 n)$ time by doing binary search, which Joriki notes below can be improved to $O(\log^2 n)$ with a sufficiently clever implementation. This gives an $O(\log^2 n)$ algorithm for determining whether $n$ is a perfect square. Is there a significantly faster algorithm which correctly decides whether $n$ is  perfect square, without also producing the square root?

131345,Isomorphism of Banach spaces implies isomorphism of duals?,"I can't make up my mind whether this question is trivial, or simply wrong, so i decided to ask, just in case someone sees a fallacy in my reasoning: Question: Suppose $V,W$ are two banach spaces, and $T:V\to W$ is an isomorphism. Is $T^*:W^*\to V^*$ an isomorphism? On the one hand this seems trivial- it requires a little work, but one can show that $T^*$ is injective, given that $T$ is surjective without working too hard, so if $T^*$ is also surjective, the open mapping theorem should finish the work for us: To show this, let $f\in V^*$ be arbitrary. Then $f\circ T^{-1}:W\to \mathbb{C}$ is bounded and linear (since $T^{-1}$ and $f$ both are), and $$T^*(f\circ T^{-1})(w)=f\circ T^{-1}(Tw)=f(w)$$ again, this apears (to me, at least) to be correct, but my little experience with Banach spaces has taught me to fear such immediate results, when discussing duals :-P... anyhow, I would be very happy if someone could tell me if I'm correct, or otherwise, give a counter-example, or point to a mistake. Additionally, assuming this isn't as immediate as I thought- does the assertion hold when $T$ is an isometric isomorphism? Thank you very much

131352,Solution set of $\cos(\cos(\cos(\cos(x)))) = \sin(\sin(\sin(\sin(x))))$,"(I'm new here, so I hope this question hasn't come up before) A bit of motivation for the problem: It is well-known that the equations $\cos(x) = \sin(x)$, $\cos(\cos(x)) = \sin(\sin(x))$, and $\cos(\cos(\cos(x))) = \sin(\sin(\sin(x)))$ all have infinitely many solutions in $\mathbb{C}$ (the first and third have infinitely many solutions in $\mathbb{R}$ as well).  The proofs in these cases are elementary, but break down when applying it to further (lacking a better word) iterations.  Using the fourth to illustrate: Consider the two functions $\cos(\cos(\cos(\cos(z))))$ and $\sin(\sin(\sin(\sin(z))))$, and for convenience, let $H(z) = \cos(\cos(\cos(\cos(z)))) - \sin(\sin(\sin(\sin(z))))$. Also, let $V = \{z \in \mathbb{C} \, | \, H(z) = 0\}$. The original question (while not phrased in this manner) was: Find $V$. It is not difficult to verify that $\not\exists z\in V$ such that $\Im(z) = 0$.  To prove this, locate local extrema of the function $H(x)$ (where in an abuse of notation, I use $H(x)$ to denote the restriction of $H$ to the real numbers), and one will find that all (relative) maximum and minimum values of the function $H(x)$ are strictly positive.  In fact, one can prove that $H(x) \geq \frac{1}{10} > 0$, $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$.  There is a sharper estimate, but this is sufficient for our purposes, and proves that there are no real solutions to the equation $H(x) = 0$. Having proved that there exist no real solutions, the question now becomes: Is it possible to analytically (i.e. without numerical methods) prove that $V$ is non-empty? My first instinct was to try to use the Argument Principle, as applied either to a ball of radius $n\in\mathbb{N}$ centered at $0$, or a rectangle of side-length $n$ centered at $0$, but I'm not sure if those integrals can be computed explicitly (even as contour integrals). Note:  It would be elementary to write an algorithm based on Newton's Method or some improvement thereof and attempt to find roots.

In part (1), we are to prove that $\cosh(t)\leq e^{t^2/2}$ for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$.  Part (2) (which I don't think I need yet for the step I am stuck on) is to show that for $p\geq1$, $t^p\leq p^pe^{-p}e^t$ for I assume $t>0$.  These steps I have done. The part I am stuck on is this: Let $(\varepsilon_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of Rademachers (i.e. independent random variables taking on values $\pm1$ with equal probability), and let $(a_k)_{k=1}^\infty\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that $$\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\sum}}a_k^2=1$$ and define $$f=\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\sum}}a_k\varepsilon_k$$ We want to show that $$\mathbb{E}(e^f)\leq e$$
(If you have any doubts, this is expectation over the epsilons). Here has been my attempt so far:
$$\mathbb{E}(e^f)=\mathbb{E}\left(\exp\left(\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\sum}}a_k\varepsilon_k\right)\right)=\mathbb{E}\left(\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\prod}}\exp(a_k\varepsilon_k)\right)=\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\prod}}\left(\mathbb{E}\exp(a_k\varepsilon_k)\right)\leq\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\prod}}\left(\mathbb{E}(2\cosh(a_k\varepsilon_k))\right)$$
the second to last equality is by independence, and the last inequality here follows from the definition of $\cosh$.  Then by part (1), we have
$$\leq\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\prod}}\left(\mathbb{E}\left(2\exp\left(\frac{a_k^2\varepsilon_k^2}{2}\right)\right)\right)$$
But since $\varepsilon_k^2=1$ for all $k$, and we can move the expectation back outside, and put the product back into the exponent as a sum, we will get something like $$2^n\exp\left(\underset{k=1}{\overset{n}{\sum}}\frac{a_k^2}{2}\right)=2^n\exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$$ by assumption on the sum of $a_n^2$.  So this does not give the inequality we want.

Let me recall some definitions and properties in the first place: Infinitessimal lifting property: given an algebraically closed field $k$, a finitely generated $k$-algebra $A$ with $X=Spec A$ non-singular, and an exact sequence $0\rightarrow \mathcal{I} \rightarrow B' \rightarrow B \rightarrow 0$, where $B,B'$ are k-agebras and $I\subset B'$ is an ideal such that $\mathcal{I}^2=0$, any k-algebra homomorphism $A\rightarrow B$ lifts to a h-algebra homomorphism $A\rightarrow B'$, and two such homomorphism differ by a k-derivation of A into $\mathcal{I}$, namely an element in $Hom_A(\Omega_{A/k},\mathcal{I})$. An infinitessimal extension of a k-scheme $X$ by a coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ is a pair $(X',\mathcal{I})$ where $X'$ is a k-scheme and $\mathcal{I}$ is a sheaf of ideals on $X'$ with $\mathcal{I}^2=0$ and such that we have isomorphisms $(X',\mathcal{O}_{X'}/\mathcal{I})\cong (X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ (as k-schemes) and $\mathcal{I}\cong \mathcal{F}$ (as $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules). For instance, the trivial extension of $X$ by $\mathcal{F}$ is given by the pair $(X,\mathcal{F})$, where the $X$ has structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X'=\mathcal{O}_X\oplus \mathcal{F}$ with product $(a\oplus f)\cdot (a'\oplus f')=aa'\oplus (af'+a'f)$, so that $\mathcal{F}$ becomes an ideal sheaf in $X$. If $X=Spec A$ is affine and $\mathcal{F}$ is a coherent sheaf, then any extension is isomorphic to the trivial one: we just use the previous lifting property to construct a splitting of an appropriate short exact sequence. Now regarding the correspondence I wrote down at the offset: let $X',\mathcal{I})$ be an infinitessimal extension of $X$ by $\mathcal{F}$ and let $\{U_i\}$ be an affine open cover of $X$ (so that sheaf cohomology is isomorphic to Cech cohomology). By the previous remark, we know that on every open affine set the extension is trivial, namely of the form $(U_i,\mathcal{I}_{|U_i}=\mathcal{O}_{U_i}\oplus \mathcal{F}_{|U_i})$. From the way we constructed the trivialisation (choosing a lift, and noting that the difference of two lifts gives an element of $Hom_A(\Omega_{A/k},\mathcal{I})$, we see that this gives a cocyle in $\check{H}^1(X,\mathcal{F}\otimes \mathcal{T}_X)$. I am confused about the converse: How do we obtain an infinitesimmal extension of $X$ by $\mathcal{F}$ from a cohomology class in $H^1(X,\mathcal{F}\otimes \mathcal{T}_X)$? For instace, if $X=P_k^2$ and $\omega_X$ is the sheaf of differential two forms, then $H^1(X,\omega_X^1)\cong H^1(X,\omega_X\otimes \mathcal{T}_X)$. A nontrivial cocycle is given by $\xi \in H^1(X,\omega_X^1)$ given over $U_{ij}=U_i\cap U_j$ (where the $\{U_i\}$ are the standard open subsets covering $P_k^2$) by $\xi_{ij}=\frac{x_j}{x_i}d\left(\frac{x_i}{x_j}\right)$.

At this point most of the proofs I've seen turn to the Mean Value Theorem, and then make use of the continuity assumption, but doesn't the existence of $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ mean that
$$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(t,y+h)-f(t,y)}{h} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$$

131722,What is the number of bijections between two multisets?,"Let $P$ and $Q$ be two finite multisets of the same cardinality $n$. Question : How many bijections are there from $P$ to $Q$? I will define a bijection between $P$ and $Q$ as a multiset $\Phi \subseteq P \times Q$ satisfying the properties: $\Phi=\{(p_1,q_1),(p_2,q_2),\ldots,(p_n,q_n)\}$, $P=\{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n\}$, and $Q=\{q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\}$. For example, suppose $P=\{1,1,1,3\}$ and $Q=\{1,1,2,2\}$.  Then there are two bijections between these multisets: $\{(1,1),(1,1),(1,2),(3,2)\}$ and $\{(1,1),(3,1),(1,2),(1,2)\}$. There seems to be two natural ways we could attempt to do this: Use $S_{|P|}$ to act on $P$. Use $S_{|P|} \times S_{|Q|}$ to act on $P \times Q$. In either case, the action induces an action on the set of bijections from $P$ to $Q$.  However, it seems difficult to find the size of the stabiliser subgroup (in either case). [ Motivation : A formula for the number of bijections would help me with a program I'm writing, in which I'm summing over all bijections from $P$ to $Q$ (which happen to be number partitions).

For the above question to be non-zero, we require $\sum_{v \in V_1} \mathrm{deg}(v)=\sum_{v \in V_2} \mathrm{deg}(v)$, where $\mathrm{deg}(v)$ is the degree of vertex $v$,counting multi-edges with their multiplicity. In the above example, $V_1=\{1,3\}$, with degrees $3$ and $1$, respectively, and $V_2=\{1',2'\}$, with degrees $2$ and $2$, respectively.  The two bipartite multigraphs have edge multisets $\{\{1,1'\},\{1,1'\},\{1,2'\},\{3,2'\}\}$ and $\{\{1,1'\},\{3,1'\},\{1,2'\},\{1,2'\}\}$.","['graph-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'multisets', 'combinatorics']"

If they are written in the top row of this triangle, starting with the $0$th Bell number, which is $1$, and each number is the sum of the two above, it, then the numbers on the left edge are the Bell numbers starting with the $1$th Bell number (not to be confused with the $1$st Bell number....):
$$

& & & & 52 & & 151 & & 523 \\

The number at the very bottom tells us what number to write next in the top row, and thus we have a recursion that gives us the whole sequence of Bell numbers.  Now of course this tells us that
$$
\sum_{i=1}^\ell \binom \ell i B_i = B_{\ell+1},\tag{TYPO HERE}

$$
\sum_{i=0}^\ell \binom \ell i B_i = B_{\ell+1}
$$ end of later edit Now ""everybody knows"" (?) that much.  (See Gian-Carlo Rota's paper ""The Number of Partitions of a Set"" in the 1964 volume of the American Mathematical Monthly .)  But the triangular array implies more than that.  Number the rows starting with $0$ and the entries in each row starting with $0$, so that $B_{j,i}$ is entry $i$ in row $j$.  Then the triangular array tells us that
$$
\sum_{i=k}^\ell \binom{\ell-k}{i} B_{j,i} = B_{j+\ell-k,\,j}.\tag{TYPO HERE}
$$ Later edit: The index $k$ above should have gone from $0$ to $\ell-k$.  And since $\ell$ and $k$ appear only in the expression $\ell-k$, we may as well just use $\ell$ to denote what was called $\ell-k$.  And we also fix another problem in the line below:
$$
\sum_{i=0}^\ell \binom \ell i B_{j,i+k} = B_{j+k-1,k}

132108,An underdetermined linear system for GPS,"I'm reading the paper ""An Underdetermined Linear System for GPS"" by Dan Kalman, and solving the equations. It's all going fine until near the bottom of page 388, where the equation $$0.02t^2-1.88t+43.56=0$$ is stated and subsequently solved: [...] leading to two solutions, 43.1 and 50.0 . If we select the first solution, then $(x, y, z) = (1.317, 1.317, 0.790)$, which has a length of about $2$. We are using units of earth radii,
  so this point is around 4000 miles above the surface of the earth. The second value of
  $t$ leads to $(x, y, z) = (.667, .667, .332)$, with length $0.9997$. That places the point on
  the surface of the earth (to four decimal places) and gives us the location of the ship. My question is how he got the values 43.1 and 50.0 ? Every time I solve it, using the quadratic formula, I get 41.4 and 52.5 , which is different.

132135,When do we have that Absolute hodge classes= Hodge classes for complex projective manifolds?,"If X is a complex projective manifold we have in general that: Algebraic classes $\subseteq$ Absolute Hodge classes $\subseteq$ Hodge classes In the case of abelian varieties it was proved that Hodge classes are absolute. I am just starting to read some facts about Hodge theory and the Hodge conjecture(I dont have a strong background on Complex geometry and Algebraic geometry) and I have some general questions. Questions: I heard that the Hodge conjecture may not be true in general for all complex projective manifolds, but possible for some cases (e.g.: Abelian Varieties). -I would like to ask what kind of categories of complex projective manifolds $Y$ satisfies: Abelian varieties $\subset Y \subset $ Complex projective manifolds and if it has been proved for a larger category than the Abelian varieties one that the Hodge classes are absolute? -What any other results do we have related to HC for Abelian varieties? I would also appreciate any references about the topic.","['algebraic-geometry', 'complex-geometry']"
132136,Complex structure v.s. conformal structure in more than 1 complex dimension,"I've recently been learning some complex geometry, mostly for my own edification. In the course of my studies I came across the following statement: If $X$ is a Riemann surface then a choice of complex structure is equivalent to choice of conformal structure. That is, complex structures and conformal structures on a Riemann surface are in bijection. I haven't seen an analog of this statement for higher dimensional manifolds. Given that the intuition that one develops in 1-complex variable falls apart alarmingly fast in several complex variables, I suspect that complex and conformal structures are not equivalent in higher dimensions. My question is as follows. Are complex structures and conformal structures inequivalent in dimension >1? If so how can I understand this (why aren't they)? Furthermore, does the correspondence fall apart in any controlled way. For instance does conformal structure imply a complex structure but that the converse no longer holds? Or are conformal and complex structures simply incomparable in higher dimensions?","['complex-geometry', 'conformal-geometry', 'complex-analysis']"
132148,A Number Field that's Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$ is either totally real or totally imaginary,"I came across the following assertion in the Wikipedia article about totally imaginary number fields . Let $K/\mathbb{Q}$ be an algebraic number field that is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$. Then $K$ is totally real or it is totally imaginary . Now, since I don't have any references for this result I was trying to prove it myself, and my supposed proof is the following. What I think is that I basically only need the fact that $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension, and then I use the following condition, that is equivalent to normality. Since $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is normal then every embedding $\sigma: K \hookrightarrow \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ is an automorphism of $K$, which means in particular that $\sigma(K) = K$. Then since we either have $K \subset \mathbb{R}$ or else $K \cap (\mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{R} ) \neq \emptyset$ then this shows that $K$ is either totally real or totally imaginary. Now my questions are if my proof is correct or if I'm missing something and if someone can provide me some references where totally real, totally imaginary and CM-fields are treated at least is some detail or where I can find some basic properties of these types of number fields. Thank you very much.","['algebraic-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

132170,Union of topologies,"I need to prove that if $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are topologies of a set $X$, then $\tau_1 \cup \tau_2$ is not necessarily a topology on $X$. I'm looking for counterexamples. I have one: consider $X=\{a,b,c\}$, and $\tau_1=\{\emptyset, X, \{a,c\}\}$ and $\tau_2=\{\emptyset, X, \{a,b\}\}$ then $\tau=\{\emptyset, X, \{a,c\}, \{a,b\}\}$, but note that: $\{a,b\} \cap \{a,c\} =\{a\}\notin \tau$, therefore $\tau$ is not a topology for $X$.

132172,Is $\cos \cos 1 - \sin \sin \sin 1$ positive?,"How can I show that $$\cos \cos 1 - \sin \sin \sin 1$$ is positive? This is motivated by this question .  If $$\begin{align}
f(x) &= \cos \cos \cos \cos(\pi/2 + ix) - \sin \sin \sin \sin(\pi/2+ix)\\
     &= \cos \cos \cos \sinh x - \sin \sin \sin \cosh x,
\end{align}$$ then it looks like $f(x)$ has a zero in the interval $(0,1)$.  This would imply that $$
\cos \cos \cos \cos(z) - \sin \sin \sin \sin(z)
$$ has infinitely-many zeros in the strip $0 < \Im(z) < 1$. One way to show that such a zero exists would be to show that $f(1) < 0 < f(0)$, the right-side of which is the current question.  I don't know how to show the left side either, but now I'm interested in this question for its own sake.","['trigonometry', 'inequality']"
132173,How can Radon-Nikodym and Borel-Cantelli be used to calculate Probability distribution?,"Let $\zeta=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^{-n}\,\omega_{n}$ , where $\omega_{n}$  are independent, $\mathbb{P}(\omega_{n}=1)=p\neq\frac{1}{2}$ . Also $\mathbb{P}(\omega_{n}=0)=1-p$  for all $n\geq1$ . I want to show that the distribution of $\zeta$ does not have a density, using Radon-Nikodym and Borel-Cantelli Lemma. Radon-Nikodym establishes a connection between probability distribution and probability density function. A probability distribution exists if and only if the probability measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. To show that the probability measure $Pr$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure $\mu$, we need to first realize that there is a one-to-one correspondence between probability distribution functions and probability measure on the real line. Therefore, for some subset $A$ on the real line it suffices for us to show that $Pr(A)$$\geq$ $\mu(A)$, so that absolute continuity does not hold and the density does not exist. So, writing the probability distribution of partial sum $\zeta=\sum_{n=1}^{N}2^{-n}\,\omega_{n}$ $=$ $\sum_{m=1}^{N}(1-p)^{m}p^{N-1-m}\left(\sum_{\beta\in\{_{N-1}C_{m}\}}\Pr\left(2\omega_{1}\leq(j-\beta)\right)\right)$, where $\beta$ is just a different combination in the indicies of the sum $\sum 2^{-n}$. I suspect Borel-Cantelli should come handy here to control the infinite sum perhaps? I am a bit lost, but I would appreciate any advice. Thanks!",['probability-theory']
