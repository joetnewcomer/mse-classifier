1097856,Factor the polynomial $z^5 + 32$ in real factors,"The question that I have trouble solving is the following: Factor the polynomial $z^5 + 32$ in real factors. The answer should not use trigonometric functions. (Hint: you are allowed to use the fact that: $cos(\pi/5) = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}$ and $cos(3\pi/5) = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{4}$. In the previous question you were supposed to find the complex roots to the equation $z^5 = -32$ in polar form, resulting in the roots: $$z_1 = 2e^{i\frac{\pi}{5}}$$$$z_2 =  2e^{i\frac{3\pi}{5}}$$ $$z_3 = 2e^{i\pi} = -2$$ $$z_4 = 2e^{i\frac{7\pi}{5}}$$$$ z_5 = 2e^{i\frac{9\pi}{5}} $$ My attempt at a solution: First we know that there were only one real root to the equation $z^5 = -32$, namely $-2$. So if we write the polynomial as the equation: $z^5 + 32 = 0$ we know that $(z+2)$ must be a factor and we have four potential factors left to find. Since we know that the polynomial $z^5 +32$ only has real coefficients, the non real roots must come in pairs. We should then find two roots that are composed of conjugates of the roots with imaginary components to produce the other two real roots... But I am stuck here.","['complex-numbers', 'algebra-precalculus']"
1097859,Explanation Borel set [closed],"Closed . This question needs to be more focused . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 9 years ago . Improve this question I'm getting totally crazy with the Borel set, I use this concept for maybe two years, but I still don't know what it really is. I would really appreciate if somebody could finally explain me what is a the Borel set. These are my question: Consider a measurable set $(X,\mathscr M,\mu)$ where $\mathcal T$ the topology of $X$. 1) The Borel set is such that $\mathscr B\subset \mathscr M$ and it's the smallest $\sigma -$algebra generated by all the element of $\mathcal T$. What does it mean? I agree that all element of $\mathcal T$ are in $\mathscr B$, and also all element of 
$$\{Y\mid \exists U\in\mathcal T: Y=X\backslash U\}$$
by definition of a $\sigma-$algebra, but I know that there is a lot of other set, for exemple, let take the measurable set $(\mathbb R,\mathscr M,m)$ where $m$ is the Lebesgue measure and $\mathbb R$ provide with it's usual topology. Why $[1,2[$ is in the Borel set ? 2) A consequence of the first question, how to prove in general that a set is in the Borel set (excepted if it's an open or a close set, it's clearly obvious) ? 3) What is the fantastic side of this set ? Evry body talks about the Borel set like something gorgeous, where is the genius there ? 4) Does the Borel set of $(X,\mathscr M,\mu)$ depend of $\mu$ ? Or only of the Lebesgue measure ? And is a Lebesgue measurable set is always $\mu-$ measurable ? 5) By the way why a $\sigma -$algebra is called a $\sigma -$algebra ? What the $\sigma $ mean ? I hope my questions are clear. I'll probably complete this post in the future, and when I'll have more answers.","['general-topology', 'measure-theory']"
1097865,How prove this limits $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{v_{5}(1^1\cdot 2^2\cdot 3^3\cdot 4^4\cdots\cdot n^n)}{n^2}=\frac{1}{8}$,"Interesting Question: Let denote by $v_{p}(a)$ the exponent of the prime number $p$ in the prime factorization of $a$, show that
  $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\dfrac{v_{5}(1^1\cdot 2^2\cdot 3^3\cdot 4^4\cdots\cdot n^n)}{n^2}=\dfrac{1}{8}$$ My some idea: since
$$1^1\cdot 2^2\cdot 3^3\cdot 4^4\cdots\cdot n^n=\dfrac{(n!)^n}{1!\cdot 2!\cdot 3!\cdots (n-1)!}$$
and it is well know
$$v_{5}(n!)=\lfloor \dfrac{n}{5}\rfloor+\lfloor\dfrac{n}{5^2}\rfloor+\lfloor\dfrac{n}{5^3}\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor\dfrac{n}{5^k}\rfloor+\cdots=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\lfloor\dfrac{n}{5^k}\rfloor$$
so
$$v_{5}(1^1\cdot 2^2\cdot 3^3\cdot 4^4\cdots\cdot n^n)=n\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\lfloor\dfrac{n}{5^k}\rfloor-\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(\lfloor\dfrac{i}{5^k}\rfloor\right)$$

1097958,Functions satisfying $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\ \mathbb{N}$ and $f(f(n))+f(n+1)=n+2$,"Find all functions $f$ such that $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\  \mathbb{N}$ and $f(f(n))+f(n+1)=n+2$ Let us plug in $n=1$ $f(f(1))+f(2)=3$ Since the function is from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, $f(2)$ can only take the values $1,2$. Now we divide the problem into cases. Case-1: $f(f(1))=2,f(2)=1$ We can assume that $f(1)=c$ for the time being. Then plugging in $n=3$ and using $f(2)=1$ gives $$f(3)=4-c$$ and again since the range of the function is positive integers,then $4-c$ has to be positive and hence $c$ belongs to  {$1,2,3$}. Now, $$f(1)=c$$$$\implies f(f(1))=f(c)$$$$\implies 2=f(c)$$ by the assumption that $f(f(1))=2$ . Now,since $c$ can only take the values $1,2,3$,we start treating cases. If $c=1$,$$f(c)=2$$$$\implies f(1)=2$$ but we know from the deinition of $c$ that $f(1)=c=1$,a contradiction.If $c=2$,then $2=f(c)=f(2)$ but $f(2)=1$ by assumption. Finally,if $c=3$ $$2=f(c)=f(3)$$ but $$f(3)=4-c=4-3=1$$ which is once again a contradiction. Therefore there are no such functions in this case. Case-2: $f(f(1))=1,f(2)=2$ Again assuming $f(1)=c$ and using $f(n)\le n$ along with plugging $n=c-1$ will give us that $f(1)=1$ and then it is easy to prove that such a function exists by recursion. I can only give a ""sort of recursive"" way to define the function. Here it goes $$f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$$$$f(1)=1$$$$f(n)=n+1-f(f(n-1))$$ But this case is harder to deal with.Some help will be appreciated.","['algebra-precalculus', 'contest-math', 'functional-equations']"

1097964,My proof of $\lim_{n\to\infty} (1 / n) = 0$,"Is my proof correct? We consider the sequence

    (x_n)_{n = 1}^{\infty},
    \qquad \text{where} \qquad

  \end{equation*} $\textbf{Theorem.}$
  \begin{equation*}
    \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = 0.
  \end{equation*} $\textit{Proof.}$
  By definition, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = 0
  \end{equation*}
  if and only if,
  for every positive real number $\varepsilon$,
  there is a natural number $N$ such that,
  for every natural number $n > N$,
  we have $|x_n - 0| < \varepsilon$, i.e. $|x_n| < \varepsilon$.
  Let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\varepsilon > 0$.
  It remains to prove that there is a suitable $N$.
  Necessarily, there is a $N \in \mathbb{N}$
  such that $N > 1 / \varepsilon$.
  It remains to prove that this $N$ is suitable.
  To that end, let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > N$.
  Obviously, $n$ is positive.
  It remains to prove that
  $|  x_n| < \varepsilon$, i.e.
  $|1 / n| < \varepsilon$.
  Since $1 / \varepsilon < N$ and $N < n$,
  we have the inequality $1 / \varepsilon < n$.
  Certainly, each side of the inequality is positive.
  Thus,
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      (1 / \varepsilon)^{-1} & > n^{-1} \\
                 \varepsilon & > 1 / n.
    \end{split}

  Also, since $n$ is positive, we have $1 / n = | 1 / n |$.
  Thus, $| 1 / n | < \varepsilon$.

Define $M := \bigl\{\emptyset, \{a, b\}, \{c\}, \Omega\bigr\}$. Then $(M, \oplus, \odot)$ is a subring of $(2^\Omega, \oplus, \odot)$, but not an ideal:
$$\{a\} \odot \{a, b\} = \{a\} \not\in M \, .$$ Is that correct? Are there easier examples?","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

1098273,Question about Angle-Preserving Operators,"This an exercise out of Spivak's "" Calculus on Manifolds "". Edit:  There was a typo in the exercise as is noted below in the answers.  The statement has been edited to reflect this. Given $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the angle between $x$ and $y$ is defined by $$\angle(x,y) = \arccos\left(\frac{\langle x,y \rangle}{|x|\cdot |y|}\right),$$ where $\langle x,y \rangle$ denotes the standard Euclidean inner product. A linear operator $T:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is said to be angle-preserving if
$\angle(T(x),T(y)) = \angle(x,y)$ for every $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The exercise as stated: Let $\{x_{1},\dots, x_{n}\}$ be a basis for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.  Then suppose that $\lambda_{1}, \dots, \lambda_{n}\in \mathbb{R}$ are such that $Tx_{j} = \lambda_{j}x_{j}$ for each $j = 1,\dots, n$. Then $T$ is angle-preserving only if (not if and only if!)$|\lambda_{i}| = |\lambda_{j}|$ for every $1\leq i\leq j\leq n$. I'm having problems with the $(\Rightarrow)$ direction. My best attempt (which seems to lead nowhere) is to suppose that $|\lambda_{j}|\neq |\lambda_{k}|$.  Then by assumption,
\begin{align*}
\angle(Tx_{j},Tx_{k}) & = \arccos\left(\frac{\langle Tx_{j},Tx_{k} \rangle}{|Tx_{j}|\cdot |Tx_{k}|}\right)\\
& = \arccos\left(\frac{\langle \lambda_{j}{x_{j}},\lambda_{k}{x_{k}} \rangle}{|\lambda_{j}{x_{j}}|\cdot |\lambda_{k}{x_{k}}|}\right)\\
& = \arccos\left(\frac{\lambda_{j}\lambda_{k}\langle {x_{j}},{x_{k}} \rangle}{|\lambda_{j}|\cdot|\lambda_{k}|\cdot|{x_{j}}|\cdot |{x_{k}}|}\right)\\
& = \arccos\left(\text{sign}(\lambda_{j})\text{sign}(\lambda_{k})\frac{\langle {x_{j}},{x_{k}} \rangle }{|{x_{j}}|\cdot |{x_{k}}|}\right)\\
\end{align*}
may also be calculated as
\begin{align*}
\angle(Tx_{j},Tx_{k}) & =  \angle(x_{j},x_{k})\\
& = \arccos\left(\frac{\langle x_{j},x_{k} \rangle}{|x_{j}|\cdot |x_{k}|}\right).
\end{align*} Then since $\arccos$ is injective, I believe I can make the jump that $\text{sign}(\lambda_{j})\text{sign}(\lambda_{k}) = 1$, which does not resemble the conclusion that I should arrive at. Note:  I wasn't sure what tag to put this under, so anyone who knows better please feel free to adjust. Thanks for any help you can give.","['operator-theory', 'differential-geometry']"
1098282,Proving generalized Cassini's identity using determinant?,"Motivation It is not hard to show, by using the general solution, that Proposition. If $(a_{n})_{n\in\Bbb{Z}}$ satisfies the recursive formula $ a_{n+2} = pa_{n+1} + qa_{n}$ , then for any $n, i, j$ we have $$ a_{n+i}a_{n+j} - a_{n+i+j}a_{n} = (-q)^{n}(a_{i}a_{j} - a_{i+j}a_{0}). \tag{*}$$ Indeed when $a_{n} = F_{n}$ and $i = j = 1$ , (*) reduces to the Cassini's identity . But by noting that the Cassini's identity is also proved by taking determinant of the identity $$ \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^{n} = \begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_{n} \\ F_{n} & F_{n-1} \end{pmatrix}, \tag{1} $$ I suspect that (*) may also be proved in a similar way which does not rely on the knowledge of the general solution. Meditating on the identity (*), it is quite tempting to consider the matrix $$ A_{n} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{n+i+j} & a_{n+i} \\ a_{n+j} & a_{n} \end{pmatrix} $$ as (*) is now read as $\det A_{n} = (-q)^{n}\det A_{0}$ . And in view of the proof of the Cassini's identity, we would like to claim that $$ A_{n} = \begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^{n} A_{0}. $$ But this is not true except for some special case (such as $i = j = 1$ ). And neither I was able to find an alternative matrix relation that produces (*).

Does the conclusion follow if $f(x)$ is of bounded variation, but not absolutely continuous? This question represents the last of my ""not entirely confident"" answers I gave on my recent qualifying exam. Generally, I'm concerned about whether I've applied all the concepts correctly in my proof. ATTEMPT: Given that $f(x)$ is absolutely continuous, we have that $f'(x)$ exists a.e. and that $\int_x^y f'(t)dt=f(y)-f(x)$ for all $y, x\in[0,1]$, $y>x$. Suppose that $L=\sup\left|f'(x)\right|<\infty$ where the supremum is taken over all $x\in[0,1]$ such that $f'(x)$ exists. Without loss of generality, let $y,x\in [0,1]$ with $y>x.$ Then we have that $\int_x^y f'(t)dt = f(y)-f(x) \leq \int_x^y L dt = L(y-x)$. Hence $f(x)$ is Lipschitz. Suppose $f(x)$ is Lipschitz; hence there is an $L<\infty$ such that $\left|f(y)-f(x)\right|\leq L\left|y-x\right|$ for $y,x \in [0,1]$. Then if $f$ is differentiable at $x\in[0,1]$, we have that, for $y\not = x$, $$\left|f'(x)\right|= \lim_{y \to x} \left|\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x}\right|\leq L\left|\frac{y-x}{y-x}\right|=L<\infty$$ hence $\sup{\left|f'(x)\right|} \leq L<\infty$. This concludes the proof. For the follow-up question, the conclusion does not follow, as a function that is not absolutely continuous cannot be Lipschitz (I provided a proof that all Lipschitz functions are absolutely continuous, but will not reproduce it here). To show that this set is nonempty, let $f$ be the Cantor function on $[0,1]$. Then $f$ is a bounded, monotone increasing function, hence of bounded variation (with total variation 1) with $f'(x)=0$ a.e. But $\int_0^1 f'(x)dx=0<f(1)-f(0)=1-0=1$ shows that $f$ is not absolutely continuous on $[0,1]$.","['proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

Prove that $a \leq f(a,b) < 1$ The $a \leq f()$ is pretty trivial, but the other inequality escapes me.

x^2 \leq x^2+y^4
$$ So... $$
\frac {x^2} {x^2+y^4} \leq 1 \forall (x,y) \neq (0,0)
$$ We can now say that: $$
\left|y^2\frac{x^2}{x^2+y^4}\right|\leq \left|y^2\right|

Since the composition of open maps is an open map, and $g$ is clearly open since it is bijective, then all that is there left to prove is that $h$ is an open map.

1099109,Pointwise approximation of a closed operator,"If $T:\mathcal D(T) \rightarrow \mathcal Y$ is a closed operator from a Banach space $\mathcal X$ to a Banach space $\mathcal Y$, is it possible to find bounded operators $T_n\in \mathscr B(\mathcal X,\mathcal Y)$ such that $T_n x\rightarrow Tx$ for all $x\in \mathcal D (T)$? If $\mathcal X$ and $\mathcal Y$ are Hilbert spaces , the polar decomposition of $T$ together with the Borel functional calculus allows one to answer the question in the affirmative, but I am not sure how to proceed in the Banach space setting, even if I assume separability . Update: If the graph of $T$ has a Schauder basis , say $(x_n,Tx_n)_{n\in \mathbb N}$, then $(x_n)_{n\in \mathbb N}$ is a Schauder basis for  $\mathcal X$ and we can consider the bounded projections $P_j( \sum_{n\geq 1}a_n x_n )= \sum_{j\geq n\geq 1}a_n x_n$. In this case $T_n=TP_n$ furnishes an approximation. Update: If $\mathcal Y$ has a Schauder basis and $T$ has a bounded inverse, then the graph of T has a Schauder basis, so that $T$ can be approximated pointwise. Assume more generally that $\mathcal Y$ has a Schauder basis and that there is a bounded operator $B\in \mathscr B (\mathcal X,\mathcal Y)$ such that $T+B$ has a bounded inverse. Then $T+B$, and therefore also $T$, can be approximated pointwise by bounded operators. In case $\mathcal X=\mathcal Y$, this covers the case of a closed operator with non-empty resolvent set. Update: In the paper 'Gaussian Measures on a Banach Space', Kuelbs constructs, for any separable Banach space $B$, separable Hilbert spaces $H_1\subset B\subset H_2$, where the inclusions are dense, bounded embeddings. It is claimed by Gill, Basu, Zachary and Steadman in the paper 'Adjoint for Operators in Banach Spaces' that any closed and densely defined operator $T$ on $B$ extends to a closed and densely defined operator on $H_2$ (Theorem 4). This would seem like a large step towards an affirmative answer in the case of a separable Banach space. Unfortunately, I do not understand the proof of Theorem 4, in particular it is not clear to me why (in the notation of the paper) $\left.A'\right|_{H_2'}$ is densely defined.

1099320,How can I visualize the nuclear norm ball?,"I want to see what the unit nuclear norm ball looks like. So I think of matrices whose singular values add up to $1$. For simplicity, let's talk about symmetric, $2\times 2$ matrices (so that I can limit myself to $3$ dimensions). These matrices can be thought of as points in a $3$-dimensional space, and the coordinate values tell us about the entries in the matrix. But what shape will the matrices that have nuclear norm $1$ form? I have seen figures showing it to be like a solid cylinder, but I can't see why.","['symmetric-matrices', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'nuclear-norm', 'functional-analysis']"

1099462,My proof of divergence of $(-1)^n$,"Should I shorten my proof?
  (Also, should I try to prove without contradiction?) We consider the sequence
  $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$,
  where
  $x_n = (-1)^n$. $\textbf{Lemma.}$
  For every element $x_n$ of the sequence $(x_n)$,
  we have $|x_n| = 1$.
  (We could prove this by induction on $n$.) $\textbf{Theorem.}$
  $(x_n)$ diverges. $\textit{Proof.}$
  We prove the theorem by contradiction.
  To that end,
  we assume that $(x_n)$ is not divergent, i.e. we assume that it is convergent.
  With that said, we are done as soon as a contradiction is deduced.
  By assumption, there is an $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    \forall \varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}, \varepsilon > 0 :
    \exists N           \in \mathbb{N}                  :
    \forall n           \in \mathbb{N}, n > N           :
    |x_n - x| < \varepsilon .
  \end{equation*}
  We choose $\varepsilon = 1$.
  By assumption, there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n > N :
    |x_n - x| < 1 .
  \end{equation*}
  We choose $n = N + 1$.
  Hence, both $|x_n - x| < 1$ and $|x_{n + 1} - x| < 1$.
  Thus,
  \begin{equation*}
    |x_{n + 1} - x| + |x_n - x| < 2 .
  \end{equation*}
  Moreover,
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      2 & =   |2| \\
        & =   |2| \cdot  1  \\
        & =   |2| \cdot |x_{n + 1}| && | \text{ by Lemma} \\
        & =   |2 x_{n + 1}| && | \text{ by multiplicativeness of abs. val.} \\
        & =   |x_{n + 1} + x_{n + 1}| \\
        & =   |x_{n + 1} + (-1)x_{n}| \\
        & =   |x_{n + 1} - x_{n}| \\
        & =   |x_{n + 1} + 0 - x_{n}| \\
        & =   |x_{n + 1} + (-x + x) - x_{n}| \\
        & =   |(x_{n + 1} - x) + (x - x_{n})| \\
        & \le |x_{n + 1} - x| + |x - x_{n}| && | \text{ by subadditivity of abs. val.} \\
        & =   |x_{n + 1} - x| + |x_{n} - x| \qquad && | \text{ by evenness of abs. val.} \\
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  Hence, by transitivity, we have $2 < 2$.
  Obviously, we deduced a contradiction. QED","['epsilon-delta', 'sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"
