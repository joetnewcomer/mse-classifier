562732,"$\frac{\frac{dx}{dt}}{\frac{dy}{dt}}$, for $x(t),y(t)$","I have a hopefully simple question. I am guessing that this has been asked before but I wasn't sure how to search for it. Suppose we have two functions: $x(t)$, $y(t)$. What is $\frac{dx}{dt}/\frac{dy}{dt}$? And why? Note that this is not the setup for the standard chain rule (or at least its not obvious to me that it is). I talked to some friends and some of them say ""just cancel out the $dt$s."" Obviously, $\frac{dx}{dt}$, for example, is just the notation for a limit and not a ratio of numbers and so there is no reason as such that we should be able to ""just cancel out."" Working with the limits directly, I can get up to: $$ \lim_{\triangle t \to 0} \frac{x(t+ \triangle t)-x(t)}{y(t+\triangle t)-y(t)} $$ Thinking in terms of infinitesimals, this ""feels"" a lot like $dx/dy$ but I don't see any formal reason for why it is.

562769,What would qualify as a valid reason to believe there is a closed form?,"I noticed that almost every non-homework-level integral posted on this site prompts somebody to ask ""Do you have any reason to believe there is a closed form?"" (some recent examples here and here ) I actually never fully understood either meaning or purpose of such questions. What would qualify as a valid reason to believe there is a closed form? Why should a lack of such reason inhibit an interest in an integral? Personally, I hold the following view at this subject: we should always believe there is a closed form. Even if eventually somebody manages to prove there is no closed form in a certain class of functions, we might introduce a new special function or constant to represent a value of the integral/product/sum in question, study its properties, find other integrals that can be represented using it, discover interesting connections with other functions, etc. This happened many times in the past (think of $\operatorname{erf}(x)$, $\Gamma(x)$, $\zeta(x)$, $\operatorname{Li}_s(x)$, $K$ , $A$ , etc) and always helped to move math forward.","['closed-form', 'special-functions', 'integration', 'philosophy', 'soft-question']"

562877,What is going on in this degree 8 number field that fails to be a quaternion extension of $\mathbb{Q}$?,"This is a soft but very mathematically hands-on question. Hopefully it will be interesting to more than just me. Thanks in advance for your help in thinking clearly about what follows. I have been trying to build a quaternion extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. I have been pursuing an overly optimistic method, which has not quite been working, and I just learned from this MO question that it's impossible for it to work. I would like your help in thinking about the way it is failing; more precisely, the extent to which it is/is not working. I have obtained a family of degree 8 number fields that are not quaternion extensions, and are not even normal, but due to the construction there is (perhaps??) something quaternion-ish about them. I guess my question is really: what is the relationship of $Q_8$ to the galois group of their normal closure? Let $L=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ be a $Q_8$-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. $L$ has a unique biquadratic subfield $K=\mathbb{Q}(\theta,\psi)$ where $\theta^2,\psi^2\in\mathbb{Q}$, and thus quadratic subfields $\mathbb{Q}(\theta),\mathbb{Q}(\psi),\mathbb{Q}(\theta\psi)$ fixed by $\mathbf{i},\mathbf{j},\mathbf{k}$ respectively. From the MO question linked above I learned that $\theta^2,\psi^2>0$, but before I knew that, I reasoned as follows: $\mathbf{i}$ must fix $\theta$ and reverse the sign of $\psi$, and have order $4$ cyclic action on $\alpha$. $\alpha$ can be taken to be the square root of an element of $K$; then we must have $\mathbf{i}^2(\alpha)=-\alpha$. So, optimistically, suppose $\mathbf{i}(\alpha)= \psi/\alpha$. Then $\mathbf{i}^2(\alpha)=-\psi/(\psi/\alpha)=-\alpha$; this is promising! Suppose likewise that $\mathbf{j}(\alpha)=\theta/\alpha$. Then $\mathbf{k}(\alpha)=\mathbf{ij}(\alpha)=\theta/(\psi/\alpha)=(\theta/\psi)\alpha$, and $$\mathbf{k}^2(\alpha) = \left(\frac{-\theta}{-\psi}\right)\left(\frac{\theta}{\psi}\right)\alpha=-\alpha$$ Thus $\theta^2,\psi^2$ are equal magnitude and opposite sign. This tells us, a propos of the linked MO question, that this optimistic construction cannot actually work. However, bear with me: If all of this were actually working, we would have $\theta/\psi = i$ (up to sign), and thus the conjugates of $\alpha$ would be $$\pm \alpha, \pm i\alpha, \pm \psi/\alpha, \pm i\psi/\alpha$$ A straightforward calculation shows that any polynomial of the form $$f_{\psi^2}(x) = x^8 - 2r x^4 + \psi^4$$ with $r,\psi^2\in\mathbb{Q}$ has these as roots. If we choose $r,\psi^2$ so that $f$ is irreducible, then $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f)$ is a field of degree 8 over $\mathbb{Q}$, so even if it is not the originally-desired quaternion extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, it is something with a kind of promising-looking bunch of roots. So, consider $L=\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f)$ and let $\alpha$ be the residue of $x$ in this field.  If it were really the desired extension, it would contain $i, \psi$. We can force it to contain either one of these because we have control over the discriminant of $\alpha^4$ since we can control $r,\psi^2$. For example, choosing them so that $r^2+1=\psi^4$, e.g. $r=4/3, \psi^2=5/3$, we get $$\left(\alpha^4-r\right)^2 = (2r\alpha^4-\psi^4) -2r\alpha^4 + r^2 = r^2-\psi^4= -1$$ so that $L\supset \mathbb{Q}(i)$; in fact, $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^4)=\mathbb{Q}(i)$ because it contains it and is degree $2$. Before I realized that $L$ couldn't possibly be my desired quaternion extension, I was hoping I could put a further fullfillable constraint on $r,\psi^2$ to force it to contain $\psi$; this was of course in vain. However, the search did lead me to realize that $$\left[\alpha^2((\psi^2-2r)+\alpha^4)\right]^2=\alpha^4\left(-4r(\psi^2-r)+2(\psi^2-r)\alpha^4\right)$$
$$=2(\psi^2-r)\left(-2r\alpha^4+\alpha^8\right)=2(r-\psi^2)\psi^4$$ Thus (because $\psi^4$ is a rational square) $L$, in fact $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^2)$, contains a square root of $2(r-\psi^2)$. I found this square root by searching for elements of $L$ that were invariant under the substitution $\alpha\mapsto i\psi/\alpha$, which I wanted to correspond to $\mathbf{j}$. I was hoping for $\psi$ but instead I got a different rational square root! At any rate, we conclude that $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^2)\subset L$ contains both $i$ and $\sqrt{2(r-\psi^2)}$. (For example with $r=4/3, \psi^2=5/3$, it contains $\sqrt{-2/3}$, thus $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$.) Thus (under the condition $r^2+1=\phi^4$), $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^2)$ is generically a biquadratic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, and thus normal. On the other hand, $L$ is not normal, because it can't contain $\psi$ unless it is generated over $\mathbb{Q}$ by $i$, $\psi$, and $\sqrt{2(r-\psi^2)}$, and this is not plausible. On the other hand, $f$ splits in $L(\psi)$, so $L$'s normal closure is a quadratic extension of it. $L$ ought to have one conjugate $L'=\mathbb{Q}(\psi/\alpha)$ corresponding to the fact that $\alpha$ and $\psi/\alpha$ are both roots of $f$ and all other roots of $f$ are obtained from these by multiplying by $i$, which $L$ and thus any conjugate contains. So, we've obained a normal degree 16 extension $L(\psi)$ of $\mathbb{Q}$. I guess my question amounts to, what's the relationship between its Galois group and $Q_8$? (It seems to me that, at least, $Q_8$ should be a subgroup, with $\mathbf{i}$ sending $\psi\mapsto -\psi$, $\alpha\mapsto \psi/\alpha$, and $\mathbf{j}$ fixing $\psi$ and sending $\alpha\mapsto i\psi/\alpha$. Is this right?)","['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'soft-question', 'galois-theory', 'field-theory']"

563098,It is not always possible to express two diagonal matrices as polynomials of some matrix,"I am looking for an illuminating proof of the following statement: There are not any polynomials $p,q$ and matrix $X$ over $GF(2)$ such that $p(X)=A:=\operatorname{diag}(1,0,0)$ and $q(X)=B:=\operatorname{diag}(0,1,0)$. (Note that the underlying field is $GF(2)$, not $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.) The statement originated from a remark I made to MSE/562509 and it is also related to MSE/326293 and MO/34314 . I have verified by computer that the statement is indeed true. Here is a proof that I find unsatisfactory: Suppose $p(X)=A$ and $q(X)=B$. As $A,B\neq 0,I$, by Cayley-Hamilton theorem, there are only six possible choices of $p$ or $q$, namely,
  $$
p(x),q(x)\in\{x,\ x+1\}\cup\{x^2,\ x^2+1\}\cup\{x^2+x,\ x^2+x+1\}=S_1\cup S_2\cup S_3 \textrm{ (say)}.
$$
  Since $A$ differs from $B$ and $B+I$, we must have $p\in S_m$ and $q\in S_n$ for some $m\ne n$. Therefore, either $X$ or $X+I$ lies inside $\operatorname{span}\{p(X),q(X)\}=\operatorname{span}\{A,B\}$. So, $X$ must be a diagonal matrix. As some two diagonal entries $x_{ii}$ and $x_{jj}$ of $X$ are equal to each other (because $X$ has three diagonal entries but $GF(2)$ has size two), it follows that $a_{ii}=a_{jj}$ and $b_{ii}=b_{jj}$, which is a contradiction.

  (M_1, v_1)\cdot(M_2, v_2) = (M_1 M_2, v_1 + M_1v_2)
\end{equation} By definition, I know the affine group is the set of all invertible affine maps and I know that the general linear group is the set of all invertible linear maps. I also know that an affine map is just a linear map without preserving the origin, and hence all linear maps are affine maps. It seems reasonable to me that affine maps can be constructed from linear maps, but I do not see everything from the above definition of semi-direct product. The only other idea I have is relating the difference between linear maps and affine maps, which is: translations. So I am thinking that the second coordinate vector gives us our translation, and the first coordinate gives us our linear transformation, however why not switch $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the second coordinate? Or why is $M_1$ in the second coordinate and not $M_2$? Specifically, How does the above semi-direct product give us all invertible affine maps? Why not just a direct product or some other product? Why is the equation exactly as specified? Why not switch $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the second coordinate or $M_1$ and $M_2$? I guess the second coordinate confuses me the most since it is what makes it different then a direct product, so please explain why the second coordinate takes that form. Please share anything else you think is useful in understanding semi-direct products, how they arise (constructing groups?) and how they work in this specific example. Please let me know where I am right and wrong :) Thanks for all the help","['affine-geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'group-theory', 'semidirect-product']"
563322,Proof that negative binomial distribution is a distribution function?,"In my textbook, a clear proof that the Geometric Distribution is a distribution function is given, namely $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \Pr(X=n)=p\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-p)^{n-1} = \frac{p}{1-(1-p))}=1.$$ Then the textbook introduces the Negative Binomial Distribution ; it gives a fairly clear explanation for why the PMF of a Negative Binomial random variable $N$ with parameter $r$ is $$p\binom{n-1}{r-1}p^{r-1}(1-p)^{n-r} = \binom{n-1}{r-1}p^{r}(1-p)^{n-r} $$ But to show $$\sum_{n=r}^{\infty} \Pr(N=n)=\sum_{n=r}^{\infty}\binom{n-1}{r-1}p^{r}(1-p)^{n-r}=1$$ the textbook gives (in my opinion) a wordy and informal argument that is nowhere near as clear.

563359,Is there a dissection proof of the Pythagorean Theorem for tetrahedra?,"Of the many nice proofs of the Pythagorean theorem, one large class  is the ""dissection"" proofs, where the sum of the areas of the squares on the two legs is shown to be the same as the area of the square on the hypotenuse.  For example: One generalization of the Pythagorean theorem is De Gua's Theorem , which concerns right-angled tetrhaedra: For such a tetrahedron, the areas $A,B,C$ of the three ""legs"" are related to the area $D$ of the ""hypotenuse"" by the formula
$$
A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = D^2.
$$
See here for a simple proof of this theorem.  Note that both sides of this equation have units of area-squared, i.e. four-dimensional volume. My question is: Is it possible to prove De Gua's Theorem using a ""dissection"" in four dimensions?

I have tried using the method to show that given $g \in C_0(B_1)$, there exists $(f_n) \subset C^{\infty} (B_1)$ such that $f_n \rightarrow g$ in $C(\overline{B_1})$, that is, I make use of the modllifier $\varphi_\varepsilon$ and consider $g \star \varphi_\varepsilon$, then $$|g \star \varphi_\varepsilon (x) - g(x)| \leq \int_{B_1} \varphi(z)|g(x - \varepsilon z) - g(x)|dz \rightarrow 0$$ uniformly since $g$ is uniformly continuous. Using the approach, the only fact I need to show is $[g \star \varphi_\varepsilon - g]_\alpha \rightarrow 0$ as well. However, this is where I got stuck. If I try to calculate the semi-norm directly, then we have $$[g \star \varphi_\varepsilon - g]_\alpha = \sup_{x \neq y} |\int_{B_1} \varphi(z) \frac{(g(x - \varepsilon z) - g(x)) - (g(y - \varepsilon z) - g(y))}{|x - y|^{\alpha}}dz|$$ and I have no idea how can I proceed.

Find $c \ne 1$ such that $\mathbf{E}(c^X) = 1$ For sake of time, I'll spare rewriting the work which leads to the following conclusion that the equation to solve for $c$ is (given $c \ne 1$), 
$$\mathrm{E}[c^X]=1=c^{-1}(1-p)+ cp$$ This is surely easy to solve, but I am nearing my final 1/2 hour for today and tomorrow is the exam. At the moment, I just don't see or recall how to solve this. We are expected to solve these kinds of equations by hand (i.e. no wolframalpha.com and arguably we shouldn't have to rely on it for solving equations like these) My next step to solve for $c$: $$1=c^{-1}(1-p)+ cp \implies \frac{1}{c}-\frac{p}{c}+cp - 1 = 0$$ What next?

563555,Doubt in a proof in algebraic geometry,"I'm trying to understand this proof: Theorem If $\nu_{n,d}:\mathbb P^n\to \mathbb P^N$ is a Veronese embedding and $X$ a hypersurface of degree $d$, then $\nu(X)$ is a hyperplane in $\nu (\mathbb P^n)$. Proof We write the homogeneous coordinates in $\mathbb P^N$ as $v_{i_0,\ldots,i_n}$, where $i_0,\ldots,i_n\ge 0$ and $i_0+\ldots,i_n=d$. The map $\nu:\mathbb P^n\to \mathbb P^N$ is given by $\nu(x_0:\ldots:x_n)=(\ldots:v_{i_0,\ldots,i_n}:\ldots)=(\ldots:x_0^{i_0}\cdots x_n^{i_n}:\ldots)$. We see that the image $\nu (\mathbb P^n)$ is the set of the zero of the polynomials $V_{i_0,\ldots,i_n}\cdot V_{j_0,\ldots,j_n}=V_{k_0,\ldots,k_n}\cdot V_{l_0,\ldots,l_n} \ \ \ \ \ \ (*)$ Where $i_r+j_r=k_r+l_r$ for every $r=0,\ldots,n$. Obviously, by definition that the points of $\nu(\mathbb P^n)$ satisfy $(*)$. Conversely, if $v=(\ldots:v_{i_0,\ldots,i_n}:\ldots)$ satisfy $(*)$, we have at least one of the coordinates of this kind $v_{0,\ldots,d,\ldots,0}$ nonzero, because in the contrary every coordinates of $v$ is zero by $(*)$. ( WHY? ) Suppose wlog $v_{d,0,\ldots,0}\neq 0$. Given $x_0=v_{d,0,\ldots,0},\ x_1=v_{d-1,1,0,\ldots,0},\ \ldots, \ x_n=v_{d-1,0,\ldots,1}$ and consider $x=(x_0:\ldots :x_n)\in \mathbb P^n$. we want to prove that $\nu(x)=v$. We have $v(x)= (\ldots:(v_{d,0,\ldots,0})^{i_0}(v_{d-1,1,\ldots,0})^{i_1}\cdots(v_{d-1,0,\ldots,1})^{i_n}:\ldots)=^{**}(\ldots:(v_{d,0,\ldots,0})^{d-1}(v_{i_0,\cdots,i_n}):\ldots)=(\ldots:v_{i_0,\ldots,i_n}:\ldots)=v$ Where the equality $(**)$ follows from $(*)$, since $d\cdot i_0+(d-1)(i_1+\ldots +i_n)=i_0+(d-1)(i_0+\cdots +i_n)=i_0+d(d-1)$.( WHY? ) I really need help in this proof, I would be very grateful if any specialist could help me in these two doubts.

Setting $f(n)=n\cdot2=n+n$ for all $n<\omega$, as well as \begin{aligned}
g(m) & = m & \text{if $m<\omega$}\\
g(m) & = \omega+\omega +m & \text{otherwise}
\end{aligned} it seems that $g\circ f(n)=g(n\cdot2)=n\cdot2$ (since $n\cdot2<\omega~~\forall n<\omega$). Thus it follows that $\sup\{g\circ f(\omega)\}=\omega\cdot2<\omega\cdot3$. So far so good. But it turns out that the next exercise requires us to show the following. Theorem. Let $\kappa<\lambda<\mu$ be three limit ordinals and $$f:\kappa\rightarrow\lambda$$ and $$g:\lambda\rightarrow\mu.$$ Suppose $\sup\{f(\kappa)\}=\lambda$ and $\sup\{g(\lambda)\}=\mu$, and that $g$ is nondecreasing, i.e., if $\alpha\le\beta<\lambda$ then $g(\alpha)\le g(\beta)$.

563937,Demonstrating that a cycloid solves the Tautochrone Problem,"I've become stuck on a problem from my calculus textbook, while attempting some revision. The problem: I'm told that the following parametric equations describe an arc of a cycloid that is the solution to the Tautochrone Problem, that is to say that the time taken for an object to reach the bottom of the curve is independent of the objects starting point. (So long as we don't bring friction into the picture) $$x(\theta) = a(\theta - Sin(\theta));\\ y(\theta) = a(Cos(\theta)-1).$$ The question asks that verify that the curve is a solution to the Tautochrone Problem and provides the following two hints. The speed of an object (v) at $\theta$, that started from $\theta_{0}$, is given by $v = \sqrt{2g(y(\theta_{0})-y(\theta))}$ The transit time to the bottom of the curve (T) is given by the following integral, $$T = \displaystyle\int_{\theta_{0}}^\pi \frac{1}{v} ds$$ Where 's' is the arc length parameter for the curve. My attempt: So given the information above, and that this question is in a chapter on parametric curves, it seems that the only thing to do is determine a relationship between the arc-length parameter and the parameter given in the equations provided. So start by writing the position vector for any point on the curve as, $\boldsymbol{r}(\theta) = \left(x(t), y(t)\right)$ The arc-length (s) of the curve, on the interval $\left[\theta_{0}, \theta\right]$, is given by the integral. $$\begin{align}
s & = \int_{\theta_{0}}^{\theta} \ \left|\frac{d \ \boldsymbol{r}}{d \ \tau}\right|d \ \tau \\ \\
\therefore \frac{d \ s}{d \ \theta} & = \left|\frac{d \ \boldsymbol{r}}{d \ \theta}\right|
\end{align}$$ Returning back to our integral for the Transit time, we use the above to change the variable of integration. $$T = \displaystyle\int_{\theta_{0}}^{\pi} \frac{1}{v}\frac{ds}{d\theta}d\theta$$ $$\therefore T = \displaystyle\int_{\theta_{0}}^{\pi} \frac{1}{v}\left|\frac{d\boldsymbol{r}}{d\theta}\right|d\theta$$ Trouble is I get this horrible integral and i'm not sure that it would even show what I've set out to show. Or in other words i'm pretty sure i've gone wrong somewhere, or maybe i've just plain gone down the wrong track altogether. $$T = \sqrt{\frac{1}{ga}}\displaystyle\int_{\theta_{0}}^{\pi} \frac{2\sin\left(\theta/2\right)}{\left(2\cos(\theta_{0}) - 2\cos(\theta)\right)^{1/2}}\ d\theta$$ Edit: So turns out the integral is totally solvable with a simple trig identity that i had no idea about...","['geometry', 'calculus']"

If $a_0=0$, we get $0, -1, 1, 1, \ldots$ Likewise if $a_0=-1$, we get $-1,1,1,\ldots$. But how can we find all $a_0$?","['sequences-and-series', 'algebra-precalculus']"

564396,Best fit line using geometric distance (not vertical distance),"There must be a theory of finding the best fit line to a bunch of points in the plane, where ""best fit"" is defined by the geometric distance, not vertical distance.  In other words, we are trying to minimize the sum of the squares of the distances from the points to the line, where the distance is measured along lines that are perpendicular to the best fit.  What is this theory called, and where can I learn about it?","['statistics', 'regression']"
564401,"Examples of rare, meager and nonmeager sets in $\mathbb{R}$","Kreyszig Functional Analysis book presents the following definition. I'm trying to get some examples. (a) The cantor set $K$ is rare in $\mathbb{R}$ because it's closed and has empty interior so that $$\operatorname{int}\left(\overline{K}\right)=\operatorname{int}(K)=\varnothing.$$ (b) The set $\mathbb{Q}$ of rationals numbers is meager in $\mathbb{R}$ because it's enumerable so that we can write $$\mathbb{Q}=\{r_1,r_2,...,r_n,...\}=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty{\{r_i}\},$$ where $\{r_i\}$ is rare for all $i\in\mathbb{N}$. (c) I think that $(0,1)$ (like any other non-degenerate interval) is a nonmeager set in $\mathbb{R}$. My question is: how to prove it?. Thanks.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'baire-category']"
564422,Equation $\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}=\sqrt{2013}$ in rationals,"Can we find all rational numbers $x,y$ such that $\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}=\sqrt{2013}$? Certainly possible answers are $(2013,0)$ and $(0,2013)$. If we square the equation, we get $x+y+2\sqrt{xy}=2013$, so $\sqrt{xy}$ must be rational.",['number-theory']
564427,"Prime ideals in $C[0,1]$ and ultrafilters","I'm looking for prime ideals in the ring $C[0,1]$ of continuous functions $[0,1]\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$. I raised that question recently and got good answers but now I'd like to improve a bit the construction with ultrafilters. So, could you help me? Consider an ultrafilter $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $[0,1]$ such that for each $x\in [0,1]$ there exists $U\in \mathcal{F}$ such that $x\notin U$ (there exists such ultrafilter indeed). Now we build an ideal $I\lhd C[0,1]$ which consists of all continuous $f:[0,1]\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that $f^{-1}(0)\in \mathcal{F}$. It is easy to see that $I$ is an ideal indeed: Suppose $f,g\in I$, i.e. $f^{-1}(0),g^{-1}(0)\in \mathcal{F}$. Then $(f+g)^{-1}(0)$ contains $f^{-1}(0)\cap g^{-1}(0)$ which is in $\mathcal{F}$, so $f+g\in I$ also. Other properties can be proved similarly. Also it can be shown that $I$ is a prime ideal. Is it true that $I$ is never maximal? Each maximal ideal in $C[0,1]$ is $\mathrm{Ker}(ev_x)$ ($ev_x$ is an evaluation map), so we are to show that $\forall x\in [0,1]$ there exists $f\in I$ such that $f(x)\ne 0$. So, if we take $x\in [0,1]$ we can find $U\in \mathcal{F}$ such that $x\notin U$. However we cannot finish this reasoning by 'but there exists $f:[0,1]\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $U=f^{-1}(0)$'. Well, could you improve this?","['ring-theory', 'ideals', 'abstract-algebra']"
564441,I want to prove that these definitions of expected value hold,"Let $(\Omega,\mathcal B,P)$ be a probability space. I have two (related) questions.  Assuming that $g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is Borel measurable, and understanding that $$E(g(X)) = \int_{\Omega}g(X(\omega))dP(\omega),$$ how do I prove that these equalities hold for the two following circumstances? First, $X$ is discrete, with range $\{x_{i}:i\in \mathbb N\}$. Then $$E(g(X))=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}g(x_{i})P(X=x_{i}),\ \  \text{ provided } \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}|g(x_{i})|P(X=x_{i})<\infty.$$ Second, $X $ is absolutely continuous with density $f.$  Then $$E(g(X))=\int g(x)f(x)dx\ \ \text{ provided }\int |g(x)|f(x)dx<\infty.$$ and my try:I think about number one I can write $$E(g(X))=\int_{\mathbb R}g(X)dP$$ As regards $X$ is  discrete I think $$E(g(X))=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}g(x_{i})\int dP=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}g(x_{i})P(X=x_{i}) $$
about number two i just now $X$ is absolutely continuous hence$$P_{X}(E)=\int_{E}f(x)dx \qquad \forall E \in \mathcal B_{\mathbb R}$$
thanks for any help.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'expectation']"
