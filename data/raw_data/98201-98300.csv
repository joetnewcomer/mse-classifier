1356622,Existence of a continuous mapping that maps the closed unit ball onto its exterior,"I saw the post about a continuous mapping $F: X \to X$ where $X$ is an infinite-dimensional Banach space that maps the closed unit ball of $X$ onto the unbounded set. A continuous mapping with the unbounded image of the unit ball in an infinite-dimensional Banach space It is very interesting to me, is there such a continuous mapping $F: X \to X$ that maps the closed unit ball of $X$ onto its exterior. That is, let, as in the previous link, $X$ be an infinite-dimensional Banach space, $B=\{x\in X: \|x\| \leq 1\}$, $E=\{x\in X: \|x\| \geq 1\}$. Does there exist a continuous mapping $F: X \to X$ such that $F(B)=E$? Or, at least, $F(B)\subset E$.",['functional-analysis']
1356647,Is it possible to integrate $\int \frac{1} {{\sin x+\sec^2x}}{d}x$,"I am a newbie in learning topic of integration.  My friend asked me to find indefinite integral shown below $$I=\int \frac{1} {{\sin x+\sec^2x}} \, \mathrm{d}x \tag 1$$ What I tried until now is the substitution $t=\sin x$ and $\frac{\textrm{d}t}{\textrm{d}x}=\cos x$ .
Now, converting equation $(1)$ in terms of $t$ to get $$I=\int \frac{(1-t^2)^{1/2}} {{1+t(1-t^2)}} \, \mathrm{d}t$$ But, as you can see, it became more complicated than the original equation $(1)$ .

It is quite some time ago that I covered this, but I think I can remember that one can actually show this by considering the convex energy functional. Unfortuantely, I think one needs that $\Omega$ is bounded or something like that.

Taking partial derivatives with respect to $x,y$ respectively $\frac{{\partial \frac{{\cos x - \cos y}}{{x - y}}}}{{\partial x}} = 0$, $\frac{{\partial \frac{{\cos x - \cos y}}{{x - y}}}}{{\partial y}} = 0$ gives $\sin x={ - \frac{{\cos x - \cos y}}{{x - y}}}$ and  $\sin y={ - \frac{{\cos x - \cos y}}{{x - y}}}$. Plugging them back and we have the desired result $\left| {\frac{{\cos x - \cos y}}{{x - y}}} \right| \le 1$. What I want to ask is, is there more decent way to show the inequity?

1356796,Bartlett's paradox in Bayesian evidence,"I've come across Bartlett's ""paradox"" (not to be confused with Lindley's paradox , also known as the Lindley-Bartlett paradox) in Bayesian statistics. The paradox originates from Bartlett's 1957 paper, A Comment on D. V. Lindley's Statistical Paradox . Bartlett's paradox is quite trivial. Suppose that with a Bayes-factor, one compares two models, $a$ and $b$, each with adjustable parameters. Model $b$ has an adjustable parameter $p$ that a priori could take on broad range of values $N$, for which a uniform distribution is an appropriate prior (suppose that it's a location parameter). The Bayes-factor is
$$
\frac{p(D\mid M_a)}{p(D\mid M_b)} \propto N
$$
If a priori we know very little about the parameter $p$, it might be that we want to consider an improper prior $N\to\infty$ or at least very large $N$. In this case, the we ought to favor model $a$, almost regardless of the data (though here we must take care with the limit - if each $p(D\mid M)$ is normalized, $p(D\mid M_b) \ge p(D\mid M_a)$ for some $D$). What are we to make of this? Is it paradox? How should we deal with this situation in which we have insufficient prior information to constrain a model parameter but want to make a model comparison? Maybe nothing has gone wrong, and we really should favour model $a$ in this situation?","['paradoxes', 'bayesian', 'statistics']"
1356801,"Why do siamese magic squares have real eigenvalues, symmetric around zero?","There is a standard method to construct magic squares of odd size, known as the Siamese construction . I'll write $S_m$ for the $m \times m$ Siamese square. For example, here is $S_5$. 17    24     1     8    15

Can anyone explain why? Remark In case anyone is curious how I found this, I am teaching myself MATLAB and came up with the task of listing characteristic polynomials of magic squares as a more or less random task which would involve learning some basic control structures and some mathematical tools.

1356802,The sum of two continuous periodic functions is periodic if and only if the ratio of their periods is rational?,"There are several questions here on MSE about the periodicity of the sum of two continuous, periodic functions. Here's what I know so far: It's obvious that if the ratio of the periods is rational, the sum of the functions will be periodic with a period equal to the LCM of the individual periods. It's relatively easy to give a counterexample to show that the sum of two continuous periodic functions is not always periodic, for instance by considering $\sin(x) + \sin(\pi x)$ . My hunch is that in fact, the sum of two continuous periodic functions is periodic if and only if the ratio of their periods is rational. First of all, is this true? Secondly, if it's true, the sufficient part  is obvious, but is there a simple proof to show the necessary part? By a ""simple"" proof I mean one that is accessible to someone with no extensive formal knowledge of analysis or algebra. This is the closest proof I could find , but I can't quite follow it.","['periodic-functions', 'real-analysis']"

\Phi(x_{1},x_{2}):=\left(x_{1}+h(x_{1}+x_{2}),x_{2}-h(x_{1}+x_{2})\right) \tag{1}
\end{align*} 
  What is the (Lebesgue) measure (denoted by $\left|\cdot\right|$) of the set $\Phi(\Omega)$? Implicit in the problem statement is that $\Phi(\Omega)$ is Lebesgue measurable, but this is obvious as $\Phi$ is the composition of continuous functions, so $\Phi(\Omega)$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. If we knew that $h$ was $C^{1}$, then the Jacobian of $\Phi$ is
\begin{align*}
J\Phi(x_{1},x_{2})=\begin{bmatrix} {1+h'(x_{1}+x_{2})} & {h'(x_{1}+x_{2})} \\ {-h'(x_{1}+x_{2})} & {1-h'(x_{1}+x_{2})} \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
which has determinant $1$ everywhere. Whence,
\begin{align*}
\left|\Phi(\Omega)\right|=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}\chi_{\Phi(\Omega)}(x_{1},x_{2})\mathrm{d}x_{1}\mathrm{d}x_{2}=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}\chi_{\Omega}(x_{1},x_{2})\left|J\Phi(x_{1},x_{2})\right|\mathrm{d}x_{1}\mathrm{d}x_{2}=1
\end{align*} My thought was to approximate $h$ uniformly in a neighborhood of $[-2,2]$ by a smooth function $g$, so that $\left|h(x_{1}+x_{2)}-g(x_{1}+x_{2})\right|<\epsilon$ for all $(x_{1},x_{2})\in\Omega$, given $\epsilon>0$. Denote the analogue of $\Phi$ with $g$ instead of $h$ by $\Phi_{\epsilon}$. One can verify that $$\forall x=(x_{1},x_{2})\in\Omega,\quad \left|\Phi(x)-\Phi_{\epsilon}(x)\right|=\sqrt{2}\left|h(x_{1}+x_{2})-g(x_{1}+x_{2})\right|<\sqrt{2}\epsilon$$ So $\Phi(\Omega)\subset U_{\epsilon}:=\left\{y\in\mathbb{R}^{2} : d(y,\Phi_{\epsilon}(\Omega))<\sqrt{2}\epsilon\right\}$ and $\Phi_{\epsilon}(\Omega)\subset V_{\epsilon}:=\left\{y\in\mathbb{R}^{2} : d(y,\Phi(\Omega))<\sqrt{2}\epsilon\right\}$. We obtain that
\begin{align*}
1=\left|\Phi_{\epsilon}(\Omega)\right|\leq\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}\chi_{V_{\epsilon}}(x)\mathrm{d}x
\end{align*}
Since $\Phi(\Omega)$ is compact, in particular closed, $\chi_{V_{\epsilon}}\rightarrow\chi_{\Phi(\Omega)}$ a.e. as $\epsilon\downarrow 0$. From monotone convergence, we obtain that

1\leq\left|\Phi(\Omega)\right| \tag{2}

\begin{align*}

&=E[Var^2(X\mid Y)]-MMSE^2(X|Y)\\

E[Var^2(X\mid Y)]&=E[(E[(X-E[X|Y])^2|Y])^2] \\
&\le E[(E[(X-E[X|Y])^4|Y)]\\

1357086,Infinite sum of elements in a finite field,"This is a bit of a curiosity that intrigues me. Let $p$ be a prime and consider the sum of reciprocals of squares divisible by $p$. This is just
$$
\dfrac{1}{p^2}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{1}{n^2} = \dfrac{\pi^2}{6p^2}.
$$
Then the sum of the reciprocals of squares not divisible by $p$ is 
$$
S = \sum_{\substack{n=1\\ p \nmid n}}^\infty \dfrac{1}{n^2}= \sum_{n=1}^\infty\dfrac{1}{n^2} - \dfrac{\pi^2}{6p^2} = \dfrac{\pi^2}{6} \left( 1 - \dfrac{1}{p^2} \right).
$$
Now here's a bit of trouble (for me at least). We can view the terms of $S$ as elements in the field $\mathbb{F}_p$. Indeed, there's no division by the characteristic of the field, $p$. Since the field is closed under addition, the addition of each term is an element of the field. Therefore the addition of every element in the sum gives an element in the field. However $\frac{\pi^2}{6} ( 1 - \frac{1}{p^2} )$ is clearly not an element of $\mathbb{F}_p$. I think the problem lies in that the limit of the partial sums does not exist modulo $p$, at least in this case. However, are there instances where it makes sense to add an infinite number of elements in a finite field, say perhaps when the sequence of terms has finite period?

calculation on the boundary. But is there an analogous version of part 1? This question comes from my previous question in which I did such a calculation. In the GTC part 1, we consider a perametrized set of intervals $[0,t]_{t \in R}$. So the generalization ought to consist of a set of (hyper-)surfaces $\{\Sigma_{t}\}_{t \in R}$ in $R^N$. And thus, we wish to calculate the derivative of the mapping $t \mapsto \int_{\Sigma_t} \omega$.

I believe that the derivative of the map $t \mapsto \int_{\Sigma_{t}} \omega$ is equal to $\oint_{\sigma_t} \omega_{t}$, where $\omega_{t}$ is some differential form that represents $\omega$ ""evaluated at"" $\sigma_{t}$.

I thought of something like this, take $x\in\mathfrak{h}$, and write $x=\sum x_i$ for $x_i\in\mathfrak{g}_i$. I want to show $x_i\in\mathfrak{h}$ for each $i$. I did this by induction on the number of nonzero summands. If there is only one summand so $x=x_i$, the claim is clear. If there's more than one summand, I'm not sure how to reduce it to imply the induction, if this is the right idea.","['semisimple-lie-algebras', 'representation-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'lie-algebras', 'direct-sum']"

1357412,Derivative that doesn't care about countable subsets?,"In Lebesgue integration, if you change a function on a countable subset of its domain, neither integrability nor the value of the integral changes. The same is obviously not true for differentiation, which is locally defined through a limit. Now I wonder: Is there a definition of differentiation that also is ""immune"" against changes on countable subsets? Well, I guess one could simply define ""a function $f$ is X-differentiable in $x$ if there exists a function $g$ that is differentiable in $x$ and agrees with $f$ almost everywhere"", but that's sounds like cheating.

1357458,"How would I complete my proof that $\int_a^bf(g(x))\,dx = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)}f(x)\frac{d}{dx}(g^{-1}(x))\,dx$?","Around two years ago during a second semester calculus class, my professor remarked that $\int\sin(x^2)\,dx$ could not be integrated. Being a bit defiant, I tried (in vain) to prove him wrong.  While my efforts (obviously) were not successful, I did notice that: $$\int_a^bf(g(x))\,dx = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)}f(x)\frac{d}{dx}(g^{-1}(x))\,dx$$ Will hold if $g(x)$ is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on the interval from $a$ to $b$. I worked this out via intuition initially, but I recently decided I would try to prove it formally.  What I have so far is below. Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$, $b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. Let $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be functions such that $g'(x) > 0$ for $a < x < b$. Let $P_n = \{[x_0,x_1],[x_1,x_2],...,[x_{n-1},x_n]\}$ be a partition of $[a,b]$, such that $\lim_{n\to\infty} x_{i} - x_{i-1} = 0$ for any $i \in \mathbb{N}$. Then: $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{i=1}^n (f(g(x_i)))(x_i-x_{i-1}) = \int_a^b f(g(x))\,dx$$ Let $S_n = \{[g(x_0),g(x_1)],[g(x_1),g(x_2)],...,[g(x_{n-1}),g(x_n)]\}$ be a partition of $[g(a),g(b)]$. At this point I planned to show: $$(f(g(x_i))\frac{d}{dx}g^{-1}(g(x_i)))(g(x_i)-g(x_{i-1})) = (f(g(x_i)))(x_i-x_{i-1})$$ I have intuition that this would work, but I can't see how to actually do it. I feel like I am missing something obvious, I just can't tell what that is. With that result I planned to finish the proof by showing that \begin{align}\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)}f(x)\frac{d}{dx}(g^{-1}(x))\,dx =& \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{i=1}^n (f(g(x_i))\frac{d}{dx}g^{-1}(g(x_i)))(g(x_i)-g(x_{i-1}))\\
=& \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{i=1}^n (f(g(x_i)))(x_i-x_{i-1})\\
=&\int_a^bf(g(x))\,dx\end{align} I have a pretty good idea of how I would do these last steps, it is just showing that one equality that is tripping me up. So my question is how would I complete this proof or modify it so that it can be completed easily? Or if the original assertion is flawed please provide a counterexample. I know you could probably get this result through substitution, but I wanted to try to get it with Riemann sums for practice.","['calculus', 'integration']"

Let n > 2 be а positive integer. How many bit strings of length n are there with exactly two zeroes? Work: Part A is relatively simple. Since a bit consists of either the number 1 or 0, there are only two ways that the first slot can be filled or ${2^n}$ ways.
Since there are eight bits, the answer would be ${2^8}$ or 256 . Part B is also relatively simple. There are a number of ways to solve this one. One way is to realize that is that you can fill up seven slots with two zeros, then 6 and so on (7 + 6 + 5....+ n-1). The end result is 28 . Part C to me is a little bit tricky. Part C is almost the same as part B but it's asking about ${n}$ strings. So what I could do is expand my work from part B. The symbol ${n}$ represents the length of the bit string. So for example, if we have a 3 bit string, we have 3 slots to fill and 3! ways to fill each slot. 2! of those slots have to be filled with a zero. Then we can generalize for any bit string having exactly 2 zeros by the equation: ${\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!}}$. Is all of my work correct?

1357728,All primes $p$ for which $x^{2} +1$ irreducible over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$,"Let $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ be the field with $p$ elements. Determine all primes $p$ for which $x^{2}+1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ . Here's what I've got. I think this might be finished but I'm not sure. If $p=2$ then 1 is a root of $x^{2}+1$ so is reducible over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ . So assume $p>2$ . We have $x^{2}+1$ is reducible $\iff$ it has a root $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{F}_{p} \iff \alpha^{2}=-1 \implies \alpha^{4}=1$ . Since $\alpha^{3}=-\alpha$ and $-\alpha \neq 1$ when $p>2$ we have $|\alpha| = 4$ in $\mathbb{F}^{\times}_{p}$ . Therefore $4$ divides $p-1$ by Lagrange, i.e. $p\equiv 1$ mod $4$ therefore $x^{2}+1$ is irreducible for all primes $p>2$ not congruent to $1$ mod $4$ . For the converse, evidently this works: Since $p$ congruent to $1$ mod $4$ we have by Fermat that $p$ is the sum of squares, i.e. $p=a^{2}+b^{2}$ . So if $c=(ab)^{-1}$ in $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ then $x^{2}+1=(x+ca^{2})(x+cb^{2})$ so is reducible.","['field-theory', 'irreducible-polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'finite-groups', 'finite-fields']"

1357860,"for each $\epsilon >0$ there is a $\delta >0$ such that whenever $m(A)<\delta$, $\int_A f(x)dx <\epsilon$","This is an old preliminary exam problem: Show that, for every nonnegative Lebesgue integrable function $f:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and every $\epsilon>0$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that for each measurable set $A\subset [0,1]$ with $m(A)<\delta$ it follows that $\int_A f(x)dx<\epsilon$. Here's my attempt at a proof: Since $[0,1]$ is compact, and $f$ is real-valued, there exists an $M>0$ such that $f(x)\le M$ for all $x\in [0,1]$. Therefore, for $\epsilon>0$, let  $\delta=\epsilon/M$. Then for all  $A\subset [0,1]$ such that  $m(A)<\delta$,  we have that $\int_A f(x)dx\le Mm(A)<\epsilon$. Where here $m$ denotes Lebesgue measure. The part I'm unsure about is the existence of $M$. If the function is continuous, then there is no problem, but $f$ does not have to be continuous to be Lebesgue measurable. On the other hand, the problem says that $f$ is real-valued, not extended real-valued, so this means that $f(x)$ is defined and finite for each $x$, right?","['lebesgue-integral', 'lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory', 'integration']"

Show $Y_n \to 0$ almost surely. So far my strategy is the following: Since $\{Y_n\}$ is a monotone (decreasing) sequence, convergence almost surely is equivalent to convergence in probability, so it suffices to show that the expected value $E(Y_n) \to 0$. A naive guess is that $E(Y_n) = \frac{2\pi}{n}$. We can write 
\begin{equation}
E(Y_n) = \int_0^{2\pi}P(Y_n > l)\,d l.

1357979,Frechet derivative of squared norm $\|x\|^2$,"I got this from Analysis II, H. Amann, J. Escher, p. 152. Their definition of the derivative of a map $f$ between Banach spaces $E,F$ over the field $\mathbb{K}$ is a bounded linear operator $A\in\mathcal{L}(E,F)$ such that
$$\lim_{x\to x_0} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0) - A(x - x_0)}{\|x - x_0\|} = 0.$$ Squared-Norm Example: Suppose $H$ is a Hilbert space and define $f\colon H\to\mathbb{K}$, $x\mapsto \|x\|^2$. They claim that $f$ is continuously differentiable and compute the derivative as 
$$Df(x) = 2\operatorname{Re}\langle x,\cdot\rangle,\ \text{for $x\in H$}.$$
For a real Hilbert space $H$, $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}$, this seems ok: $Df(x)h = 2\langle x,h\rangle$. Questions: For $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{C}$, I think this is wrong. The calculation
$$f(x+h) - f(x) - 2\operatorname{Re}\langle x,h\rangle = \|h\|^2 = o(\|h\|)$$
still works.  For example, if we define $f\colon\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ by $f(x) = |x|^2$, then their claim is that $Df(x)h = 2\operatorname{Re}(x\overline{h})$. This doesn't seem to be linear.   So, their map $Df(x) = 2\operatorname{Re}\langle x,\cdot\rangle$ is not linear in the complex case, right?
