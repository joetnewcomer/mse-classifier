2425789,Purely Geometric Proof that Circles Invert to Circles,"I recently watched Douglas Hofstadter recall at the beginning of a talk about Feuerbach's Theorem the fact that under circle inversion, circles (which do not pass through the center of inversion) map to circles. He claimed it used the fact that if two inscribed angles cut the same arc, they must have equal measure (chord-angle theorem). I tried to rediscover the proof, but concluded that his chord-angle theorem was useless. Assuming his definition of circle inversion indeed inverts distances from the center, he must also use some result about distance, but power of a point proves circle inversion easily without direct reference to the chord-angle theorem. Is there a well known proof involving the chord-angle theorem?","['circles', 'geometry']"
2425793,"If $\operatorname{Ker} f$ is a $G_\delta$ set in $X$, then $f$ is continuous","$X$ is a Banach space and $f$ be a linear functional from $X$ to $\mathbb{C}$. If $\operatorname{Ker} f$ is a $G_\delta$ set in $X$, then $f$ is continuous. I know that if $\operatorname{Ker} f$ is closed, then $f$ is continuous. The argument is based on getting a ball of radius $r$ in $(\operatorname{Ker} f)^c$ and then showing that $|f(x)|\le \frac1r||x||$.

2425823,Algorithm to get the number of sorted combinations?,"Lets have a set of number S = {A,B,C,...,n} where A < B < C .... < n
how many ways can you sort their combinations? Take this small example: If the set is {1,2,8} (so n = 3) i can sort their combination in ascending order like this: 1,2,1+2,8,1+8,2+8,1+2+8 which is equal to: A,B,C,A+B,A+C,B+C,A+B+C
BUT if my set of numbers is 1,3,4 then my array will be equal to: A,B,A+B,C,A+C,B+C,A+B+C  as you can see A+B will be greater or smaller sometimes. So for N = 3 theres the follow possible combinations:
{A,B,C,A+B,A+C,B+C,A+B+C} and {A,B,A+B,C,A+C,B+C,A+B+C} theres only 2 Is there an algorithm that can take out for me this combinations(dont brute force)?

2425843,Difference between coset and subgroup,"My apologies, this must seem like a trivial question, but this image below appeared on Socratica on youtube and I wanted to clarify my thoughts on cosets and subgroups. From the image below, I can see that the left coset $g_1$ h is the composition of all elements in the subgroup h in H with an element $g_1$ from outside the set. I think of this as the elements in H are being ""translated"" out of the subgroup H and into a different object (a coset altogether). My question is since the left coset does not contain the identity element, it is therefore not a subgroup? Am I right in this reasoning?

2426117,Probability ratio convergence in limit,"The following is the question : Given random variables $X_1 \leq X_2 \leq \cdots$ such that $E[X_n] \sim A n^{\alpha}$, where $A,\alpha > 0$ ($\sim$ means that the ratio of the two quantities goes to $1$ as $n$ tends to infinitely). Given that $Var(X_n) \leq Bn^\beta$, where $\beta < 2\alpha$, and $B$ is some constant, please show that convergence of $\frac{X_n}{n^\alpha} \to A$ almost surely. Note that $X_n$ are not given independent. What I can conclude is the following : Suppose we drop the asymptotic and just assume equality (we can always compensate for this by fixing some small $\delta > 0$ and choosing sufficiently large $n$ for which the ratio is in $(1-\delta,1+\delta)$) If $Y_n = \frac{X_n}{n^{\alpha}}$, then $\Pr(|Y-A| > \epsilon) \leq \frac{Bn^{\beta-2\alpha}}{\epsilon^2}$, which goes to zero for all $\epsilon$ as $\beta < 2 \alpha$. Hence, we have convergence in probability. This means, furthermore, that there is an a.s. convergent subsequence $Y_{n_k}$ to $A$. In fact, any subsequence of $Y_n$ will have a subsequence convergent to $A$. Now, note that $X_n$ are monotonic, but $Y_n$ need not be. So I cannot conclude from the above that $Y_n \to A$.

The inner term has a form we know to be $e^{-(1+\epsilon) \lambda_n}$, hence resulting in the quantity $\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-(1+\epsilon)\lambda_n}$.

How many elements of the input sequence need to be checked on average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? Ok, we know two things: the element we're looking for is in the array P[the i-th item is the one we're looking for] = $\frac{1}{n}$ for all $i\in\{1,..,n\}$ And I think I'm supposed to get $\frac{n+1}{2}$ or $\frac{n}{2}$ or something thereabout. Let $X$ be the number of items the linear search algorithm is looking at. $$\begin{align}
P[X=1] &= \frac{1}{n} \\
P[X=2] &= \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)\frac{1}{n} \\
P[X=3] &= \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^2\frac{1}{n} \\

\mathbb{E}(X) &= \sum_{i=1}^n i\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^{i-1}\frac{1}{n} \\

I've offered a proof for complex numbers, and I am not so sure about some of the steps (namely $a_n \in \bar S_c)$ I take so a second look/hints would be appreciated! The only other theorem I have is that a closed set implies every sequence in the set converges to a point in the set. Let $\bar S = S \cup \partial S$ denote the closure of S, with $\partial S$ being the boundary. Also let $\bar S_c$ be the complement of the closure (sorry if that is unconventional). Suppose $\bar S_c$ is closed. Consider $z \in \partial S$, then $D(z, r) \cap S_c \neq \emptyset$ for any $r > 0$. Take $a_n \in D\left(z, \frac{r}{n}\right) \cap S_c$ for $n = 1, 2, ...$ Then $a_n \in \bar S_c$ because $a_n \notin S, a_n \notin \partial S$. Clearly, $a_n \rightarrow z$ as $ n \rightarrow \infty$. However, $z \in \bar S$ and $a_n \in \bar S_c$ which means there is a convergent sequence in $\bar S_c$ converging to a point outside $\bar S_c \implies \bar S_c$ is open $\implies \bar S$ is closed.","['complex-analysis', 'proof-verification']"

Say that $(U_i)_{i\in I}$ is a family of open sets of $\mathbb{R}$. So each $U_i$ is of the form $\cup_{j\in J} I_j$ where the set $J$ may depend on $i$, and the family of open intervals $(I_j)_{j\in J}$ may also depend on $i$. So to be able to write down 
$\cup_i U_i$ as the union $\cup_{i,j} I_j$ don't we have to choose (a potentially uncountable number of times) a set $J$ and a family $(I_j)_j$ for each $i$ ? Does that mean we have to apply the axiom of choice ?","['general-topology', 'logic', 'axiom-of-choice']"
2426665,Can Statistics be made Rigorous,"I am taking a statistics class this term, and this is really my first taste of the subject. We were given the following definition: Let $f_n(A)$ be the relative frequency of some random event $A$ occurring over $n$ trials. Then if $A$ occurred $0\leq m \leq n$ times: $f_n(A) = \frac{m}{n}$. After repeated trials we will find that each time $f_n(A) \approx p$ for some number $p\in[0,1]$. We call this the frequentest definition of probability, and really it says that the odds of a random event $A$ occuring is that number $p$. So naturally I think well then we must have: $$
p = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n(A)
$$ However, after more careful thought this cannot be true. Since for a sequence $f_n$ to be convergent we would need for any $\epsilon > 0$ there to exist some $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that if $n\geq N$ we have: $\left|f_n-p\right| \leq \epsilon$. But since $A$ is a random event we cannot conclude that after so many trials we won't get just a sequence of other events from the sample space that make it look like $p$ is a different value. So how do we come up with a rigorous definition of the probability of a random event? Any suggested readings would be greately appreciated.",['statistics']

2426773,Question about Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (2 ed.) problem 18-1,"In this problem, it is assumed that $M$ is orientable. My question is: why is this needed? Is this a mistake in the book, or is my solution wrong somehow? 18-1 (paraphrased): Suppose that $M$ is an oriented smooth manifold and $\omega$ is a closed $p$-form on $M$. (a) Show that $\omega$ is exact if and only if the integral of $\omega$ over every smooth $p$-cycle is zero. (b) Suppose that the $p$-th singular homology $H_p(M)$ is finitely generated by the smooth $p$-cycles $\{c_1,\ldots,c_m\}$. Show that $\omega$ is exact if and only if for each $i$, $\int_{c_i}\omega = 0$. My solution: (a) If $\omega = d\eta$ is exact, then by Stokes's theorem for chains, $\int_c\omega = \int_c d\eta = \int_{\partial c}\eta = \int_0 \eta = 0$, since $\partial c = 0$ for any $p$-cycle $c$. Conversely if $\int_c \omega = 0$ for any cycle $c$, then $c \mapsto \int_c\omega$ represents $0$ in singular cohomology. By de Rham's theorem, $\omega$ therefore is zero in de Rham cohomology, so $\omega$ is exact. (b) If $\omega$ is exact, then the integral of $\omega$ over any $c_i$ is zero by the same proof in part (a). Conversely if for all $i$: $\int_{c_i}\omega = 0$, then by linearity $\int_c \omega = 0$ for any $p$-cycle $c$, since $c$ can be written as a linear combination of the generators $\{c_1,\ldots,c_m\}$. Hence by the proof in part (a), $\omega$ is exact. $\square$ Remark: Theorem 18.12 (""Stokes's Theorem for Chains"") on p.481 of Lee's book does not assume orientability of $M$.","['algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"

2427183,How to calculate recurring probability,"I have a very basic understanding of statistics and probability. I just passed an intro college course on it. The problem is, there's one type of problem that I'd like to know how to do, and I don't have another statistics class, and it wasn't covered in this one. I think that there are other threads that answer this question, but the math is a bit over my head. So what I'm wondering is how to calculate a percentile probability based on a recurring event. Let's say event A has a 2% probability of occurring. But what if we repeat event A x number of times? I understand the (and - multiplication) and (or - addition) rules. It seems that repeating this x number of times would be an or incident, since it gives a situation multiple opportunities to occur. But the problem with that is that with enough repetitions of x, we'd eventually, and rather quickly end up with P>1, which isn't how a percentage works. For example, in our situation with a 2% likelihood, let's assume we repeat the situation 51 times. That's 51 different opportunities for the event to happen, so it falls into the or rule. If we add .02 together for all of this, we will end up with P>1. For one, this isn't how a percentile based calculation even works, since P cannot ever be greater than 1. Secondly, it seems unlikely that given 50 repetitions, something with a 2% likelihood would be certain to occur. Basically, I know I'm doing this wrong, but I don't understand what about it is wrong, and I'd like to know the right way to do it. I've done a lot of digging, but the only things that I can find that closely relate to this do not explain it without breaking down whatever formula they're using. I'd really like to know how to do it, as well as why it works the way it does. I appreciate any answers.",['statistics']

In this case, I know how to give a proof using the fact that $M^{-1}(t)M(t) = I$, and applying the product rule. However, I would like to give an argument directly from the definition if possible. A few hours of tinkering have led me nowhere fast - the issue is that the known formula is in terms of the derivative of $M$, and all methods I know of relating $M$ to $M^{-1}$, such as through the adjugate formula seem to be too ugly to recover the formula in question. Either I'm missing something, or this problem is difficult without the slick product-rule approach.

The statement of the sub-problem is as follows: We are given a set of n of the same letter. For example, n=3 would mean set = {""a"", ""a"", ""a""} . Our objective is to reduce the set to one element. We can pick any two elements s and t from the set and concatenate them. For example, we can select s=""a"" and t=""a"" , and the resulting set is {""aa"", ""a""} . Finally, we pick aa and a to achieve {""aaa""} . The cost of merging elements s and t is the product of their lengths. For example, the cost of merging aa and a is 2 x 1 = 2; the cost of merging aa and aa is 2 x 2 = 4. Prove that no matter what order you merge the elements of the set, the cost of reducing the set to one element will always be the same. My work thus far: I considered a strategy where we always add each element of the set to a selected element. For example for n = 4 , we would select a and a , then aa and a , and then aaa and a .

Also, assume that the second milestone supersedes the first, in the sense that once we know whether he is on time in completing the second milestone, it no longer matters what happened with the first milestone.

$r\to 0$, we get the limit as $\frac{0}{\sin^2(\theta)}$. The limit wouldn't exist if $\sin(\theta)=0$ (say for $\theta=0$ or $\theta=\pi$). This is the reason why the simultaneous limit as $(x,y)\to(0,0)$ doesn't exist. Method 2: (Fix $\theta$ first and then take $r\to 0$) Let us consider $\theta=0$ or $\theta=\pi$.

2427790,Isometric and isomorphic spaces are isometrically isomorphic,"Let $(X, \|\cdot\|_1)$ and $(Y, \|\cdot\|_2)$ be two normed spaces over $\mathbb{F} \in \{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}\}$ such that: $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic as vector spaces. There exists a bijective norm-preserving map $\psi : X \to Y$ , not necessarily linear . Can we conclude that $X$ and $Y$ are isometrically isomorphic? I'm aware of the Mazur-Ulam theorem (not of its proof, though), which implies that $\psi$ must be affine if $X$ and $Y$ are real. Using it, we can, even without assuming $(1)$ , conclude that if there exists an isometry (distance-preserving, not norm-preserving!) between $X$ and $Y$ then there exists a linear isometry (also distance-preserving) between $X$ and $Y$ , as noted in this question . This, however, does not imply that $X$ and $Y$ are isometrically isomorphic (i.e. it does not imply the existence of a linear norm-preserving map). Can we strengthen this to a norm-preserving isomorphism with $(1)$ ?","['functional-analysis', 'normed-spaces']"
2427795,Relationship between chi-square distribution and Poisson distribution,"Random variable $X \sim {{\chi}_{2n}}^2$ and $Y \sim P(\lambda)$.
Prove that $P(X < 2\lambda) = P(Y \ge n)$. I have found that $P(X < 2\lambda) = \frac{\int_{0}^{\lambda} e^{-x}x^{n/2-1}dx}{\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x}x^{n/2-1}dx}$ and $P(Y \ge n) = \frac{\sum_{k=n}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda^k}{k!}}{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda^k}{k!}}$. But I'm still having difficulty equating the two probability.","['statistics', 'probability']"

2427845,Triangle inequality without parallel postulate,"Without the parallel postulate, how can one prove that in any triangle $ABC$, $AB+AC>BC$? Most often, we introduce the triangle inequality a priori as part of the definition of a metric, but here everything we have is the four basic postulates (save the parallel postulate) and the five principles in Euclid's Elements . The proof Euclid himself made is actually pretty close, only that he invoked the proposition that the exterior angle is greater than an interior angle, which should be false without the parallel postulate (e.g. in spherical geometry). Is it possible to completely avoid the parallel postulate and prove the triangle inequality?","['riemannian-geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'spherical-geometry', 'geometry', 'hyperbolic-geometry']"
