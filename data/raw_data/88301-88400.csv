1185522,"Topology, Basis of a given topology.","We defined basis for a topology, and there is something that I do not understand. Here is how we defined the basis.
Given a topological space $\left(X,\mathscr T\right)$
  we defined basis for the topology to be the set $\mathscr B$
 , consisting of subsets of $X$
  if it satisfies 2 conditions. First, for all $x\in X$
  there exists $B\in\mathscr B$
  such that $x\in B$
 . Secondly if $x\in B_{1}\cap B_{2}$
  , for $B_{1},B_{2}\in\mathscr B$
 , then there exists $B_{3}$
  such that $x\in B_{3}\subseteq B_{1}\cap B_{2}$
 . So,I am studying from the book Topology, by Munkres. And it stated that the basis is a subset of the topology. But, if I choose $X=\left\{ a,b\right\}$ 
  and $\tau=\left\{ \emptyset,X\right\}$ 
 , and I can define $\mathbb{B}=\left\{ \left\{ a\right\} ,\left\{ b\right\} \right\} $
 . The set $\mathbb{B}$
  satisfies the conditions of the definitions. However it's not a subset of the topology. What am I missing here?",['general-topology']
1185535,Representing every positive rational number in the form of $(a^n+b^n)/(c^n+d^n)$,"About a month ago, I got the following : For every positive rational number $r$, there exists a set of four positive integers $(a,b,c,d)$ such that 
  $$r=\frac{a^\color{red}{3}+b^\color{red}{3}}{c^\color{red}{3}+d^\color{red}{3}}.$$ For $r=p/q$ where $p,q$ are positive integers, we can take 
  $$(a,b,c,d)=(3ps^3t+9qt^4,\ 3ps^3t-9qt^4,\ 9qst^3+ps^4,\ 9qst^3-ps^4)$$

For $r=2014/89$, for example, since we have $(2014/89)\cdot(2/3)^3\approx 6.7$, taking $(p,q,s,t)=(2014,89,2,3)$ gives us $$\frac{2014}{89}=\frac{209889^3+80127^3}{75478^3+11030^3}.$$ Then, I began to try to find every positive integer $n$ such that the following proposition is true : Proposition : For every positive rational number $r$, there exists a set of four positive integers $(a,b,c,d)$ such that $$r=\frac{a^\color{red}{n}+b^\color{red}{n}}{c^\color{red}{n}+d^\color{red}{n}}.$$ The followings are what I've got. Let $r=p/q$ where $p,q$ are positive integers. For $n=1$, the proposition is true. We can take $(a,b,c,d)=(p,p,q,q)$. For $n=2$, the proposition is false . For example, no such sets exist for $r=7/3$. For even $n$, the proposition is false because the proposition is false for $n=2$. However, I've been facing difficulty in the case of odd $n\ge 5$. I've tried to get a similar set of four positive integers $(a,b,c,d)$ as the set for $n=3$, but I have not been able to get any such set. So, here is my question.

Clearly, the $A_{i}$'s are pairwise disjoint and their union equals $\Omega$.  Now, it's also clear to me that the $\sigma$-algebra generated by these four sets is just the set of all possible unions of these, as well as $\emptyset$. I'm wondering if the only sub-$\sigma$-algebras of this $\sigma$-algebra are only the $\sigma$-algebra $\{\Omega, \emptyset \}$ and $\sigma(A_{1})$, $\sigma(A_{2})$, $\sigma(A_{3})$, and $\sigma(A_{4})$.  For each $i$, $\sigma(A_{i}) = \{ \emptyset, \Omega, A_{i}, A_{i}^{c} \}$, which shows that the intersection of any of four the $\sigma$-algebras I listed above (which has to be a sub-$\sigma$-algebra itself) is just $\{\Omega, \emptyset \}$.

1185664,What does compactness in one topology tell us about compactness in another (coarser or finer) topology?,"This problem is from section 27 in Munkres' book on topology. Let $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}'$ be two topologies on the set $X$; suppose that $\mathcal{T}'\supset \mathcal{T}$. What does compactness of $X$ under one of these topologies imply about the compactness under the other? Here is my attempt at answering this question. Case (1). Suppose $X$ is compact under $\mathcal{T}$. Since $X$ is compact, for every open covering $\mathcal{A}$ of $X$, there exists a finite sub covering of $X$, that is $\cup _{i = 1} ^{n} A_i = X $. Since $\mathcal{T}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}'$, the open sets contained in $\mathcal{T}$ are contained in $\mathcal{T}'$. It follows that every open covering of $X$ in $\mathcal{T}$ is an open covering of $X$ in $\mathcal{T}'$ and every finite subcover of these open covers in $\mathcal{T}$ of $X$  are also in $\mathcal{T}'$. Therefore, the compactness of $X$ under the coarser topology tells us that $X$ is also compact under the finer topology. Case (2). Suppose $X$ is compact under $\mathcal{T}'$. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an arbitrary open covering of $X$ by sets in $\mathcal{T}$. Since $\mathcal{T}'$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}$, this open covering of $X$, $\mathcal{A}$ must be in $\mathcal{T}'$. Since $X$ is compact under $\mathcal{T}'$, $\mathcal{A}$ must have a finite subcovering. It follows that this finite subcovering for $X$ must be in $\mathcal{T}$ so $X$ is compact under $\mathcal{T}$ as well. Therefore, the compactness of $X$ under the finer topology tells us that $X$ is also compact under the coarser topology. Initially, I thought case (2) would not imply compactness in the coarser topology but I cannot think of a counter example. Is my work correct? If not, can someone help me see the flaw in my reasoning?",['general-topology']
1185679,Question about Geometric-Harmonic Mean.,"Define our Harmonic sequence for two numbers such that
\begin{equation}
a_{n+1} = \frac{2a_nb_n}{a_n + b_n}
\end{equation} and our geometric sequence 
\begin{equation}b_{n+1} = \sqrt{a_nb_n}
\end{equation} such that as $n \rightarrow \infty$ we tend towards the Geometric-Harmonic Mean. The arithmetic-geometric mean can be defined by the following two sequences. First compute the arithmetic mean of two numbers $a,b \in  \mathbb{R_+}$ such that
$a_1$ = $\frac{1}{2}(a + b)$ and then compute the geometric mean such that $b_1$ = $\sqrt{ab}$. If we continue to iterate this operation we can define our two sequences {$a_n$} and {$b_n$} as follows: 
\begin{gather*}
a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}(a_n + b_n)
\\b_{n+1} = \sqrt{{(a_nb_n)}}. %Try and get this all under 1 square root sign
\end{gather*} 
As ${n\to\infty}$ we approach our arithmetic-geometric mean (agM). I have proved that the Geometric-Harmonic Mean exists and that $a_n$ = $b_n$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. However, Mathworld states without proof that the limit for our Geometric-Harmonic mean can be written as
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n \to \infty}a_n = \frac{1}{M({a_n}^{-1},{b_n}^{-1})} (*)

1185709,Stratonovich SDE and generator in divergence form,"Let $a:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathcal{S}_{d\times d}$ be a smooth map that takes its values in the space of $d\times d$ symmetric matrices and suppose there exists a $d\times d$ matrix valued $\sigma$ such that $a=\sigma \sigma^T$. Let  $\mathcal{L}^a:=\frac{1}{2}\nabla(a\nabla \cdot)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^d\partial_i(a^{ij}\partial_j\cdot)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}[a^{ij}\partial_i\partial_j+(\partial_ia^{ij}\partial_j)]$. It is not difficult to see, that the associated diffusion is a solution of the following SDE $dX_t=\sigma(X_t)dB_t+b(X_t)dt$, where $b=(b^j)=(\sum_{i=1}^d \partial_i a^{ij})$. Now, I have read that the associated Stratonovich SDE is given by $
dX_t=\sigma(X_t)\circ dB_t. (*)
$ I cannot verify this, as the usual formula for switching between Ito and Strato SDEs only gives $
dX_t=\sigma(X_t)\circ dB_t+\tilde{b}(X_t)dt, 
$ where $\tilde{b}:=(\tilde{b}_j)=(\sum_{i=1}^d\partial_ia^{ij}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k,l=1}^d \sigma_{kl}\partial_k\sigma_{jl})$. Using that $
\sum_{i=1}^d \partial_i a^{ij}=\sum_{i,k=1}^d \partial_i (\sigma_{ik}\sigma_{kj}^T)=\sum_{i,k=1}^d \partial_i (\sigma_{ik}\sigma_{jk})=\sum_{i,k=1}^d (\sigma_{ik} \partial_i \sigma_{jk}+\sigma_{jk} \partial_i \sigma_{ik})
$ does not seem to make the expression for $\tilde{b}$ any easier, leave alone vanish. Am I missing something or is (*) simply a mistake? In the case, where $d=1$, we have the following situation: $\mathcal{L}^af=\frac{1}{2}[\sigma^2f''+2\sigma'\sigma f']$ and the associated diffusion solves $dX_t=\sigma(X_t)dB_t+2\sigma'\sigma dt$. In this case, the formula to switch between Strato and Ito SDEs is given by $
dX_t=b(X_t)dt+\sigma(X_t)dB_t \leftrightarrow dX_t=(b(X_t)-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma'\sigma)(X_t))dt+\sigma(X_t)\circ dB_t
$ which in our case means that $
dX_t=\frac{3}{2}\sigma'\sigma(X_t)dt+\sigma(X_t)\circ dB_t,
$ which still does not result in the disappearance of the drift term.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-calculus', 'stochastic-integrals', 'stochastic-analysis']"

1185846,"Torsion and curvature of the curve $X(t) = (at, bt^2, ct^3)$","Hey all I am looking for help on a problem. I will post it, and than I will add what I have tried and my ideas etc.  The question has been up now for a few days, I'm sure someone out there can help! I even put a bounty, I have spent a lot of time on this question! I am interested in calculating the torsion ($\tau$) and curvature ($\kappa$) of the curve $$X(t)=(at,bt^2,ct^3), \quad t   \ge   0 $$ and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all positive constants. So here is what I am having problems with. It seems like there are so many different formulas for curvature, and there are also the Frenet–Serret formulas so I am having issues deciding how to do it. I was thinking maybe I could reparametrize with respect to arc length, which would give me it in terms of unit length so I could use some of Frenet–Serret formulas, but I am not confident in that. What I did so far was I calculated $X'(t)=(a,2bt,3ct^2)$ and $|X'(t)|=\sqrt{a^2+4b^2 t^2 +9c^2 t^4}$. Then I  calculated $$X''(t)=(0, 2b, 6ct)$$ and $$|X''(t)|=2\sqrt{b^{2}+9c^{2}t^{2}}.$$ I also know that the unit tangent, $$T(t)={X'(t)\over|X'(t)|}$$ and the unit normal is $$N(t)={T'(t) \over |T'(t)|}$$ and that the binormal is $B= T \times N$. But I am really not sure how to take it further. I know that in arc length parametrzation we would have $dT/ds= \kappa N$ and $dN/ds=-\kappa T + \tau B$ and $dB/ds= -\tau N$. Should I keep it in the form it is and use the equation $$\kappa={|X'(t) \times X''(t)|\over |X'(t)|^3}?$$ A few of the other things I am thinking of is that maybe I could solve for torsion by the following: I know that $T$, $B$ and $N$ form an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb R^{3}$ so can and when we write $N'=\alpha T + \tau B$ , is the coefficient, $\tau$  the definition of torsion? Moreover, noting $B= T \times N$, we have $$B'= T'\times N + T \times N' = T \times N' =T \times (\alpha T+\tau B) = \tau T \times B= -\tau N $$  (because $N=B \times T$ so $T \times B=-N)$. I think this is how I understand the derivation for that equation. Is it only in arc length parametrization that I can use the Frenet equations for example? However, I think I should be able to do it just using the regular formulas, and not an arc length parametrization as the integral would be tough. I did conform this as well, so in terms of the basics of this question I'd like to do it without arc length parametrization. I am also interested in seeing a intuitive derivation of the torsion formula (the one with the triple product). I apologize if I didn't show enough work, this is all I could do but I am very happy to learn it. Thanks a lot to any help! UPDATE: I am wondering about the validity of what I now have. In addition to above I computed $X'''(t)=(0,0,6c)$ $X' \times X''= (6bct^2,-6act,2ab)$ $(X' \times X'') \cdot X''' = (12abc)$ $|X' \times X''| = 2 \sqrt {9b^2c^2t^4+9a^2c^2t^2+a^2b^2}$.

1185921,Negative modulus,"In the programming world, modulo operations involving negative numbers give different results in different programming languages and this seems to be the only thing that Wikipedia mentions in any of its articles relating to negative numbers and modular arithmetic. It is fairly clear that from a number theory perspective $-13 \equiv 2 \mod 5$. This is because a modulus of $5$ is defined as the set $\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ and having $-13 \equiv -3 \mod 5$ would contradict that because $-3 \not\in \{0,1,2,3,4\}$. My question is then regarding a negative modulus. What definition of a modulus of $-5$ would make the most sense in number theory?

In other words, a point on $Y(N)$ is (essentially) a pair $(E,\phi)$ where E is an elliptic curve and $\phi$ is an isomorphism $E[N]\rightarrow (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2$. There is an action of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$ on $X(N)$ and $Y(N)$, given by $M \cdot (E,\phi)=(E,M\phi)$. In this paper http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bubaran/classlast.pdf , the author lets $H$  be a subgroup of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})$, and defines a modular curve $X_H(N)$ to be $X(N)$ quotiented out by the action of $H$.

On the other hand the base scheme is usually assumed at least locally noetherian and in this case finite flat and locally free of finite rank are equivalent. I have thus two questions: Why does it not make sense to consider a finite group scheme that is not flat? Why do we assume the scheme to be flat and not only to be locally free of finite rank over the base? Why do we need the noetherian hypothesis on the base scheme?

1186271,"Isothermal parameterization, Inverse of the Gauss Map","This problem is from Do Carmo's Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces. It is question 13 from chapter 3.5, to be specific. Suppose that S is a minimal surface without any umbilical points (that is to say that $k_1 = -k_2$ everywhere). Let $\bar{x}$ be a parameterization of the unit sphere by stereograhic projection, and consider a neighborhood $V$ of a point $p$ on the surface so that the Gauss map $N: S \rightarrow S^2$ restricted to the neighborhood $V$ is a diffeomorphism. The question is to show that the parameterization $q= N^{-1}$ o $\bar x$ is isothermal, meaning that $<q_u, q_u > = <q_v, q_v>$ and $<q_u,q_v> = 0$ everywhere on $S$. Now when I saw this question, my first instinct was to try to verify that $q$ was isothermal directly by computing the parameterization in some kind of coordinates directly. I know that stereographic projection is given by the formulas: $$ x= \frac {4u}{u^2+v^2+4}$$ $$ y = \frac {4v}{u^2+v^2+4}$$ $$ z = \frac {2(u^2+v^2)}{u^2+v^2+4} $$ I figured with this information, maybe I could find a way to write down what $q$ is in terms of $u$ and $v$ and take partials. The problem is that I don't know how to write down anything about $N^{-1}$. Like when working with $N$, I can say that a point on a surface $S$ goes to it's normal, which is something that I can compute in terms of cross products of partial derivatives of a parameterization of the surface.

1186323,Prove that for each $p \in Y$ the quotient field of $O_p$ is isomorphic to the field $K(Y)$.,"I'm reading Algebraic Geometry of Hartshorne. I have a question about a proof. First of all I'll write the important definitions that Hartshorne uses. Let $Y\subset \mathbb{A}^n$ be a quasi-affine variety. A function $f:Y\to \mathbb{k}$ is said to be regular at $P\in Y$ if is an open neighborhood $U$ of $P$ such that $U\subset Y$ and polynomials $g,h\in A=\mathbb{k}[x_1,...,x_n]$ such that $h$ is nowhere zero on $U$ and $f=g/h$ on $U$. We say that $f$ is regular at $Y$ if is regular at each $P\in Y$. We denote by $O(Y)$ the ring of all regular functions on $Y$. If $P\in Y$, we define the local ring of $P$ on $Y$, $O_P$ to be the ring of germs of regular functions on $Y$ near $P$. In other words, an element of $O_P$ is a pair $\left<U,f\right>$ where $U$ is an open neighborhood of $P$ and $f$ is regular on $U$. And where we identify two pairs $\left<U,f \right>$ and $\left<V,g \right>$ if $f=g$ on $U\cap V$. Finally we define the function field $K(Y)$ as the set of equivalence relations, given by elements of the form $\left<U,f \right>$ for some $U$ open subset of $Y$ (not necessary containing $P$). The operations that turns $O_p$ and $K(Y)$ into a rings an actually $K(Y)$ into a field are the usual for germs. I'm reading the proof of Theorem $3.2$, I don't understand the proof of part $d)$. It uses the following observation: My question: Prove that for each $p \in Y$ the quotient field of $O_p$ is isomorphic to the field $K(Y)$. An element $z \in Frac(O_P)$ is writen in the form $z=f/g$ where $f,g\in O_P$ and $g$ is not the zero on $O_P$. Recall that $f,g$ are equivalence classes of the form $\left<U,f \right>$ and $\left<V,g \right>$,  without lost of generality we can assume that $U=V$ otherwise we intersect the open sets and restrict the functions. I think that the most natural map is given by $\phi: Frac(O_p) \to K(Y)$ defined by: $$ \left<U,f \right> / \left<U,g \right> \mapsto  \left<U,f/g \right>$$ I proved that $\phi$ is an injective ring homomorphism.

Hence any concrete lattice $-$ i.e. a lattice of sets taken under union and intersection $-$ satisfies the infinite distributive law if it is closed under arbitrary unions. In Peter T. Johnstone's Stone Spaces , Exercise 2.5 is to prove every distributive lattice $L$ is isomorphic to a concrete lattice $\Phi$. In this case we identify each $x \in L$ with the set of all morphisms $\phi \colon L \to \{0,1 \}$ for which $\phi (x) = 1$. Some form of Choice is needed to guarantee the existence of sufficiently many morphisms. If we assume $L$ is finitely distributive and join-complete $-$ has arbitrary suprema $-$ then $\Phi$ will be closed under arbitrary unions. But then $\Phi$ hence $L$ satisfies the infinite distributive law. The conclusion is that join-complete lattices satisfy the infinite distributive law. Is there a flaw to this reasoning?

And then there are group actions acting on smooth manifolds -- here I see the use of the word ""Geometry"" as well when results are obtained regarding the basic structure of the manifold, such as the way orbits are arranged, whether there are special orbits and how orbits smoothly collapse, whether these are certain bundles and so on. I guess my question is the following: Is the study of group actions on smooth manifolds ""more fundamental"" than Riemannian geometry, or can one reduce any group action on a manifold to the presence of a (unique?) Riemannian metric on $M$ and study that metric instead? If not, are there ""geometric"" aspects of a smooth manifold that one cannot frame in terms of a group action?

If all roots of $f(x)$ are equal, then $f(x) = (x-x_1)^n$, where $x_1$ is the root of $f(x)$ Now I have problems with the other side. I don't know how to start. I started looking at special cases and I proved it for $n=2$. Let $f(x) = x^2 + ax + b$. Then the roots are $x_1 = \frac{-a + \sqrt{D}}{2}$ and $x_2 = \frac{ -a - \sqrt{D}}{2}$ Then $f(x) = (x-x_1)(x-x_2)$. Now set $f(x)$ to $k^2$ and we have: $$(2x + a + \sqrt{D})(2x + a - \sqrt{D}) = (2k)^2$$
$$(2x + a)^2 - D = (2k)^2$$ Since $D$ is some fixed number for some large enough $x$ we will have: $$(2x+a - 1)^2 < (2x+a)^2 - D < (2x+a+1)^2$$ Hence $(2x+a)^2 - D = (2x +a)^2 \implies D=0 \implies x_1 = x_2$ But i'm stuck for $n=3$ and more generally you can't use this method when the degree of $f(x)$ is bigger than 4, since there's no explicit formula for the roots of $f(x)$","['radicals', 'arithmetic', 'algebra-precalculus', 'polynomials']"
1187151,Dimension of the system of hypersurfaces of degree $d$ that passes through a point with multiplicity $m$.,"A hypersurface of degree $d$ of $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ comes from a expression like
$$
F=\displaystyle\sum_{i_{0}+\cdots+i_{n}=d}U_{i_{0},\ldots,i_{n}}X_{0}^{i_{0}}\cdots X_{n}^{i_{n}}.
$$ The hypersurfaces of degree $d$ that passes through a point $p=(p_{0}:...:p_{n})\in\mathbb{P}^{n}$ are those whose coefficients satisfy the equation $$
\displaystyle\sum_{i_{0}+\cdots+i_{n}=d}U_{i_{0},\ldots,i_{n}}p_{0}^{i_{0}}\cdots p_{n}^{i_{n}}=0,
 $$
which is a hyperplane of $\mathcal{L}^{n}_{d}$, the projective space of hypersurfaces of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$. Now, the hypersurfaces that passes through $p$ with multiplicity at least $m$ are those who satisfy the $\binom{m+n-1}{n}$ linear conditions given by the vanishing of the coefficients of the Taylor series expansion of the non-homogeneous polynomial asociated to $F$. My question is the next: These linear conditions are supposed to be independent, but how do we know?","['linear-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1187167,"If $\|u\|^2 = c^2$, then $\|\dot x\|^2 \to a $ for $\ddot x = -\dot x + u(t)$?","I am dealing with the next simple equation $$
\ddot x = -\dot x + u(t),
$$
where $u, x\in\mathbb{R}^m$, with $m \geq 1$, and I am wondering if for $\|u\|^2 = c^2 > 0$ then $\|\dot x\|^2\to a$, where $a\in\mathbb R^+$. For the trivial case of having $m = 1$ it is clear, however I do not know whether is true for $m > 1$. Any hints or references? Edit The next computations show me a bound for $||\dot x(t)||$, but I do not know how to show that it converges to a constant (if this is indeed the case). Take $y = \dot x$, then $$
y(t) = e^{-t}y(0)+\int_0^\tau e^{-I(t-\tau)}u(\tau)d\tau \\
|y(t)| \leq e^{-t}|y(0)|+\int_0^\tau \left|e^{-I(t-\tau)}\right| \, \left|u(\tau)\right|d\tau \\
|y(t)| \leq e^{-t}|y(0)|+ \sup (|u(\sigma)|)_{0\leq\sigma\leq\tau} \int_0^\tau \left|e^{-I(t-\tau)}\right| d\tau,
$$
and knowing that $|u(t)| = c, \forall t$, then $$
|y(t)| \leq e^{-t}|y(0)| + c \\
$$
Then if I take the limit $t\to\infty$ in the before expression. I can conclude that $|y(t)| \leq c$, so $|\dot x(t)| \leq c$ when $t\to\infty$. How to continue from here? I suspect that it is related with energy. If we are pumping constant energy and the system can only disipate certain energy per unit of time, they will reach an equilibrium in the sense of energy, i.e. $\dot x(t)$ might not be constant but its norm yes.","['control-theory', 'normed-spaces', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1187222,A counter-example to Radon-Nikodym Theorem?,"I am confused about the Radon-Nikodym Theorem, because of the following example which came to my mind. What is wrong in my argument? Consider $X=[0,1]$ with the $\sigma$-algebra of Borel measurable sets. Let $m$ be the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$, and let $\mu$ be defined by
  $$\mu(E)=\text{counting measure}(E\cap\mathbb{Q}),$$
  i.e. $\mu$ counts the number of rational points in $E$. Then, $\mu$ is a positive $\sigma$-finite measure because by letting $\mathbb{Q}=\{r_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ we get
  $$[0,1]=([0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q}^c)\cup\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\{r_n\}.$$
  Now, $m\ll \mu$, so by the Radon-Nikodym theorem there exists $h\in L^1(\mu)$ such that
  $$m(E)=\int_E hd\mu,\tag{1}$$
  for all measurable sets $E\subseteq[0,1]$. But then we have problem: For all $x\in\mathbb{Q}$, we get
$$0=m(\{x\})=\int_{\{x\}}hd\mu=h(x)\mu(\{x\})=h(x),$$
so $h=0$ on $\mathbb{Q}$. But $\mu$ is concentrated on $\mathbb{Q}$, so (1) shows that $m=0$. What's wrong?",['measure-theory']

1187290,Can $f(\infty)$ be defined if the sequence $f(n)$ is divergent?,"Let there be given an real-valued function $f(n)$
, with $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , $a,b \in\mathbb{R}$:
$$
f(n+1) = a f(n) + b
$$
What then is the value of $f(\infty)$ ? As a physicist by education, being brought up with with limits and calculus,
I would first derive the following, for $m\in\mathbb{N}$:
$$
f(n+m) = a^m f(n) + \frac{1-a^m}{1-a} b
$$
Consequently, but only for $|a| < 1$ :
$$
f(\infty) = \lim_{m\to\infty} f(n+m) = b/(1-a)
$$
And if $|a|\ge 1$ then this limit and so $f(\infty)$ does not exist. However, once upon a time on the internet, sci.math to be precise, I've seen an argument like this - the original is in ASCII:
$$
f(n+1) = a f(n) + b 
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
f(\infty) = f(\infty+1) = a f(\infty) + b
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
f(\infty) = b/(1-a)
$$ Thus, $f(\infty)$ is defined even if the sequence $f(n)$ is divergent. I've reproduced it as it says. Now the question is: is the latter a valid argument in mathematics, and is $f(\infty)$ indeed
defined, even if the sequence $f(n)$ is divergent?","['infinity', 'functions']"

where $f,g: [-\pi,\pi] \to \mathbb{R}$ are integral functions and that the Fourier series of $f$ and $g$ are uniformly convergent to $f,g$ respectively. $a_0,a_n,b_n,\alpha_0,\alpha_n,\beta_n$ are the fourier coefficients of $f,g$ respectively.
