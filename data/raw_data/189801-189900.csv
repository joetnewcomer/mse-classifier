3565570,Why does every non-empty subset of this poset have a supremum?,"I have a non-strict partial order $\preceq$ on $\{ 0, 1, 2 \}^{\mathbb{N}}$ given by $$f \preceq g \iff f^{-1}[\{ 2 \}] \subsetneq g^{-1}[\{ 2\}] \vee (f^{-1} [\{ 2 \}] = g^{-1}[\{ 2 \}] \wedge f^{-1}[\{ 1\}] \subseteq g^{-1}[\{ 1 \}])$$ My question is concerning a poset $<\{ 0, 1, 2 \}^{\mathbb{N}}, \preceq>$ Let $Z \subseteq \{0,1,2\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ , $Z \neq \emptyset$ Why does $Z$ have a supremum? Intuitively I could just look at element of $Z$ with the biggest preimage of 2, if there are a few of these then look at the one with the biggest preimage of 1 and then create a sequence that has 2's on as many places as cardinality of preimage of 2 and 1's on as many places as cardinality of preimage of 1. That I think would work for finite number of 2's and 1's, but I think it doesn't work for sequences with infinite number of 2's or 1's,  for example a sequence with 2's on even indices, so I imagine this approach is flawed. How to approach this for these types of sequences?","['elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory', 'supremum-and-infimum']"

  have to prove that $$|f^{(n)}(x)|\le \frac{1}{n+1}$$ where $f^{(n)}$ is the nth derivative of $f$ . I started to do a few derivatives: $f^{(1)}(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^2}(x \cos x-\sin x)$ $f^{(2)}(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^3}((2-x^2) \sin x-2x\cos x)$ $f^{(3)}(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^4}(3(x^2-2) \sin x-x(x^2-6)\cos x)$ $f^{(4)}(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^5}(4x(x^2-6)\cos x + (x^4-12x^2+24)\cos x)$ I noticed that in denominator, there is always $x^{n+1}$ (because there is $x$ in denominator of $f$ ), but I couldn't spot a pattern for the numerator that would help me prove the inequality.

3565649,Computation of Betti numbers of a given space,"Trying to verify my computations below. I don't have much intuition for homology or the Betti numbers computation. It's a simple case, yet somehow intuitively I'm surprised to get $\beta_1(W) = 3$ . Is my computation wrong? Here is how I construct $W$ . $W$ is constructed by connecting two (hollow) cylinders by drilling a hole in the two cylinders and connecting them along the hole. So you get a space $W = X \cup Y$ of the form $\quad$$\quad$ $\quad$ Where the spaces $X$ and $Y$ are essentially identical $\quad$$\quad$ $\quad$ And $W$ is obtained by gluing $X$ and $Y$ so that their intersection is a circle: $\quad$ $\quad$ $\quad$ I do not want to use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. Instead, I want to use Euler characteristics $\chi(W)$ and recover $\beta_i$ from $$\chi(W) = \beta_0(W)- \beta_1(W)+\beta_2(W)$$ I notice that $\beta_0(W)=1$ ( $W$ has one connected component) and $\beta_2(W) = 0$ (no enclosed void in $W$ ). Next, I want to use additivity of the Euler characteristic: $$
\chi(X\cup Y) = \chi(X) + \chi(Y) - \chi(X \cap Y)
$$ Using the fact that $X\cap Y$ is a circle so its Euler characteristic is zero. Because $X$ and $Y$ are identical, it is enough to compute $\chi(X)$ . Now, the space $X$ is equivalent to a cylinder with an open disk removed. I know that the Euler characteristic of a cylinder is zero. Consequently, removing a disk from a cylinder will yield a space whose Euler characteristic is $-1$ , yielding $\chi(X) = \chi(Y) = -1$ . Overall, I obtain $$
\chi(X\cup Y) = - 1 + -1  - 0 = -2,
$$ yielding $$
-2 = \chi(X\cup Y) =   \chi(W)  = \beta_0(W) - \beta_1(W) + \beta_2(W) = 1 - \beta_1(W) + 0,
$$ it follows that $\beta_1(W) = 3$ . Intuitively I would expect to have a higher $\beta_1$ for $W$ . Did I miss something or this calculation is correct? Any comments would be appreciated.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"
3565708,Let $G$ be a discrete infinite subgroup of $GL_n(\mathbb C)$. Is $G$ not algebraic in general?,"Let $G$ be a discrete subgroup of $GL_n(\mathbb C)$ . Q: If $G$ has infinite order elements, is $G$ algebraic? I do not think this is the case and it seems that $G$ fails to be algebraic for most of the classical groups I have seen. Consider $SL_2(\mathbb Z)\leq GL_n(\mathbb C)$ . Clearly the same defining equations for $SL_2(\mathbb Z)$ will pin down all elements of $SL_2(\mathbb C)$ as the equations have real coefficients. In other words, having integer entries is not an algebraic condition. So any level $N$ , the level $N$ congruence subgroup $\Gamma_N\leq SL_2(\mathbb Z)$ is not algebraic as well. Q': Suppose $G$ is a non-discrete subgroup of $GL_n(\mathbb C)$ . Say $G = SL_2(S)$ where $S$ is the integral closure of $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{5})$ . Then I do not think this $G$ will be algebraic either.

3565822,Arbitrary unions in topology and countable unions in measure theory,"There are many questions on this site about the following two topics: In the definition of a topology, why do we require it to be closed under arbitrary unions but only under finite intersections? In measure theory, why do we require a $\sigma$ -algebra to be closed under countable unions, rather than finite unions or arbitrary unions? For the first of these I feel like I more or less understand the reasons. I particularly like Thomas Andrews' answer here , interpreting topology in terms of intuitionistic logic, but I also understand the more familiar justifications in terms of 'closeness' or by generalising from real analysis. However, the second question, about $\sigma$ -algebras, still seems a bit opaque to me. The answers I understand are along the lines of ""because finite unions are too weak to give the right results, and arbitrary unions are too strong."" This is fine as far as it goes, but it doesn't give me the feeling I understand why . Now we get to my question. The two definitions seem like they should be related, both because Borel measures are in some way canonical and are defined in terms of open sets, and because the concept of a valuation (see Wikipedia , nlab ) is closely related to the concept of measure, but is defined on a topology instead of a $\sigma$ -algebra. So my question is, how exactly are the two definitions above related , particularly in regards to the distinction between arbitrary, countable and finite unions and intersections? And where exactly do valuations come in to the story? I'm interested in understanding probability theory as an extension of logic, so I would be particularly keen on an answer along the lines of Thomas Andrews' answer about topologies, explaining why $\sigma$ -algebras are the appropriate object from a logic point of view. But any answer is welcome.","['general-topology', 'measure-theory']"
3565849,Expressions for the dual of a polyhedral cone,"Let $K$ be a polyhedral cone generated by the rows of a matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times n}$ , and constrained by the columns of a matrix $B\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times q}$ , such that $K = \text{cone}(A_1^T,\dots, A_p^T) = \{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\text{ }|\text{ }x^TB\geq\textbf{0}^T\}$ , where $A_i$ denotes the $i$ -th row vector of $A$ . Additionally, suppose the matrix $AB\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times q}$ is non-negative. We have that the dual cone $K^* := \{y\in\mathbb{R}^n\text{ }|\text{ }x^Ty\geq 0\text{ }\forall x\in K\} = \{y\in\mathbb{R}^n\text{ }|\text{ }Ay\geq\textbf{0}\}$ . I want to show that it is also true that $K^* = \text{cone}(B^1,\dots, B^q)$ , where $B^j$ denotes the $j$ -th column vector of $B$ . I can see that the ' $\supset$ ' inclusion is true, because each $B^j$ is in $K^*$ (since $K = \{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\text{ }|\text{ }x^TB\geq\textbf{0}^T\}$ , and each $A_i^TB^j = (AB)_{ij}\geq 0$ by hypothesis, so we can extend linearly to cone $(A_1^T,\dots A_p^T) = K$ ), so then again by linearity I can extend to all conic combinations of the $B^j$ 's, i.e. $K^*\supset\text{cone}(B^1,\dots, B^q)$ . However, I am struggling with the other inclusion. I know that I haven't used the fact that $K^* = \{y\in\mathbb{R}^n\text{ }|\text{ }Ay\geq\textbf{0}\}$ , but I don't see how to use this.

3566006,Relations between n-ary relations,"I preface my question by stating that I have no scholarly expertise in mathematics. I have a Ph.D. in philosophy and have recently developed an interest in logic, but even logic is outside of my professional expertise. I can only hope that my ignorance in the matter that interests me is not beyond remedy. As I understand, a relation is understood in discrete mathematics as a set of ordered n-tuples. So suppose that there are two ternary relations that consist of different triples on (is ""on"" the right preposition to use here?) the same set of objects. For example, suppose that, on the set of positive integers, R1 is the set of triples (x, y, z) such that x < y < z, while R2 is the set of triples (x, y, z) such that y < x < z. I would say that there is a one-to-one correspondence between members of R1 (is ""members"" the right word? I mean the triples that belong to R1) and members of R2 in accordance with a consistent rule of permutation. But I don't know if I am describing the relation between the two relations correctly. If I am not, I hope that my intended meaning is clear enough that someone can restate it for me in a correct fashion. All of that is just to set up my main question, which is: Is there a simple way to describe the relation between R1 and R2? I have chosen a pair of ternary relations for my example, but the relations could be of any -arity. I deliberately did not use a binary relation, because that sort of case does not present the same difficulties. As I understand, two binary relations that stand in the sort of correspondence that I have described are said to be inverses of each other. (One would say ""converses"" in logic, but apparently ""inverse"" is the term standardly used in mathematics; please correct me if I am mistaken on this point.)

3566196,Details of the criterion for representability of a functor of S-schemes,"I've come across a problem that's made me look back over representabiilty of scheme functors and I'm having a lot of trouble piecing together some  categorical details that I used to think I understood. To give ourselves a concrete example with which to work, let $S$ be a noetherian separated scheme and let $\mathcal{E}$ be a quasicoherent sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{S}$ -algebras. I would like to show that there is a scheme $\bf{Spec}(\mathcal{E}) \rightarrow S$ via a representability criterion. Let $F: \text{Sch}/S \rightarrow \text{Set}$ be a contravariant functor defined as follows: On objects it sends $(T \stackrel{\mu}{\rightarrow}S)$ to the set $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_{S}-alg}(\mathcal{E}, \mu_{*} \mathcal{O}_{T})$ . To show it is representable it is enough to show that it is a sheaf for the big Zariski site on $S$ , and that it is locally representable. Let's assume we have shown already that it is a Zariski sheaf. I want to clarify exactly what more must be shown. We begin with a morphism of functors, $$
\eta: F \longrightarrow \text{Hom}_{S}(-, S).
$$ Now firstly, am I correct that the functor $\text{Hom}_{S}(-, S)$ will an object $(T \stackrel{\mu}{\rightarrow} S)$ and simply return that same object?

  would like it to be the category $\text{Sch}/U_{i}$ so I can then
  apply the known construction to the affine case. But I don't see why

3566248,Number of possible rotational domains of one 2D lattice on top of another?,"There are four (or five) two dimensional Bravais lattices which I refer to as oblique, rectangular, hexagonal and square . I'll discuss the 17 symmetry wallpaper groups below. Ignoring translation, if I ask someone to lay one hexagonal lattice on top of another with one of their axes parallel, there's only one distinct rotational way to do it. One might think there are six (since the lattice is p6 or six-fold rotationally symmetric) but they are indistinguishable. If I ask for an offset of 10 degrees then there are two ways (+/- 10°). If I ask for an offset of 60/2 = 30 degrees, the number of ways drops back to one. The expression or algorithm I need would fill out the following table: Oblique   Rectangular   Hexagonal     Square
                      2           2            6            3

Rectangular  2

Hexagonal    6       3/6 (30)              1/2 (30)

Square       4                                          1/2 (45) This is read as follows: For hexagonal on hexagonal every 30 degrees there is 1 way, and for angles that are non-zero modulus 30 degrees there are 2 ways. For square on hexagonal the number is three and six, also every 30 degrees as shown here Square and hexagonal lattices shown separately: Square and hexagonal lattices shown at 0, 30 and 60 degrees: Square and hexagonal lattices shown at +/-10 degrees (only two of the possible six are shown): In surface science if we had islands of one lattice on top of another that different only in this way we'd call them domains. Question: For pairs of 2D lattices each with either a 2, 3, 4 or 6-fold rotational symmetry (ten possible pairs in total), how can I calculate the number of possible ways I can uniquely configure them with a given angle who's absolute value is $\theta$ . This is of course likely to be a solved problem, so if one wants to point me to a description of the solution that is not written at a high level rather than doing so here, that would also be great! Wallpaper The problem is more complex if the specific symmetry group of each lattice is defined and if that can be included in the answer at the same time it will be even more helpful.

3566541,Is Pythagoras' Theorem a theorem?,"From a foundations/logic perspective, for one to prove Pythagoras' theorem, one would require the definition $$d(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol y) = \sqrt{(x_1-y_1)^2 + \cdots + (x_n - y_n)^2}$$ of distance in the first place, which embeds Pythagoras' theorem within it, so to call it a theorem seems a bit circular (although you could nitpick and prove the case for a right-angled triangle which is rotated and whose right-angle is not aligned with the coordinate axes). But basically Pythagoras' theorem is already encoded in the definition. So my question is, when we see ""proofs"" of Pythagoras such as the famous one below, what are we proving exactly? Or, more precisely, what axioms are we building off so that this is considered a proof? Is there some logical framework in which this can be considered a real proof? My guess is that this is simply something to aid our intuition and is based off our perception of the real world, and is in fact circular.

3566631,Counterexample in Fubini's Theorem (non-integrable function),"Fubini's theorem tells us that (for measurable functions on a product of $σ$ -finite measure spaces) if the integral of the absolute value is finite, then the order of integration does not matter Here is a counterexample that shows why you can't drop the assumption that the original function is integrable in Fubini's theorem: A simple example to show that the repeated integrals can be different in general is to take the two measure spaces to be the positive integers, and to take the function $f(x,y)$ to be $1$ if $x=y$ , $−1$ if $x=y+1$ , and $0$ otherwise. Then the two repeated integrals have different values $0$ and $1$ . Can somebody explain why the original function is not integrable and then show me how the two iterated integrals are not equal? Here is my attempt at understanding this: Let $\mathbb{Z}_1$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ be the two measure spaces, with (I assume?) to be a counting measure. Then apparently it's true that: $$\int_{\mathbb{Z}_2} \int_{\mathbb{Z}_1}f^y(x)\,dx\,dy \neq \int_{\mathbb{Z}_1} \int_{\mathbb{Z}_2}f_x(y)\,dy\,dx $$ But it seems like $$\int_{\mathbb{Z}_1}f^y(x)\,dx=\int_{\mathbb{Z}_2}f_x(y)\,dy=0$$ So therefore both sides of the integral, no matter which order, will equal $0$ . It seems like $\int_{\mathbb{Z}_1}f^y(x)dx=0$ because there are only two values of $x$ where this integral is going to be nonzero, once when it's $-1$ and once when it's $1$ . The same argument seems to apply if we integrate with respect to $dy$ first. What am I doing wrong here? Furthermore, why is the original functions absolute value is not finite? Thank you so much.","['integration', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-integral', 'examples-counterexamples', 'real-analysis']"

Show that $T_p \mathcal{M}$ doesn't depend on the chosen parametrization $f$ . My attempt: Let $f : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n + d}$ and $\tilde{f} : \widetilde{U} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n + d}$ both parametrize $\mathcal{M}$ around $f (u) = p = \tilde{f} (\widetilde{u})$ .

Hence, there is $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $v = D f_u \alpha$ iff there is $\widetilde{\alpha} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $v = D \tilde{f}_{\tilde{u}} \widetilde{\alpha}$ for $v \in T_p \mathcal{M}$ , and the characterization of $T_p \mathcal{M}$ is thus independent of the parametrization.

3566870,Improvement on the concept of separating families for the union-closed sets conjecture?,"The union-closed sets conjecture states the following. Let $F$ be a finite family of finite sets that is union-closed and let $\cup (F)$ be the union of all sets in $F$ . Then we can find an element in $\cup (F)$ that appears in at least half of the sets in $F$ . One can show that w.l.o.g. we can assume $F$ to be separating, that is for any two elements in $\cup (F)$ we can find a set in $F$ that contains exactly one of the two elements. So in the literature many statements concerning the conjecture are proven for separating families. However we can do better. Say a family $F$ is given. We now chose an element in $\cup (F)$ and remove it from every set in $F$ if the number of sets doesn't decrease by doing so. We repeat this process as long as we can. After that we obtain a family $\tilde{F}$ with the following property. For every $x \in \cup(\tilde{F})$ we can find $S \in \tilde{F}$ such that $x \in S$ and $S\backslash \{x\} \in \tilde{F}$ . We call families with this property minimal. It is easy to see that if $\tilde{F}$ fulfills the conjecture then so does $F$ . Thus w.l.o.g. we can assume $F$ to be minimal. Now we make the observation that being separating is strictly weaker than being minimal. Say $F$ is a minimal family and let $x, y \in \cup (F)$ . Then we can find $S \in \cup (F)$ such that $x \in S$ and $S\backslash \{x\} \in F$ . If $y \notin S$ then $S$ contains exactly $x$ and if $y \in S$ then $S\backslash \{x\}$ contains exactly $y$ . Thus $F$ is separating. Now consider the family $\{\emptyset, \{1,2\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\} \}$ . One can easily check that it is separating but not minimal. This leaves me with the following questions: Is there any literature about the union-closed sets conjecture 
that introduces a concept like minimal families? If not, is an inductive proof for the union-closed sets conjecture plausible

I have tried to calculate \begin{align*}
    \| (T - b I) f \|_2^2
    & = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} | i f'(x) - b f(x) |^2 dx \\
    & = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} | f'(x) |^2 - i b \overline{f(x)} f'(x) + i b f(x) \overline{f'(x)} + | b f(x) |^2 dx \\
    & = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} | f'(x) |^2 dx
    - i b \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{d}{dx} | f(x) |^2 dx
    + | b |^2 \| f \|_2^2 \\
    & = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} | f'(x) |^2 dx
    + | b |^2 \| f \|_2^2
    - i b \bigg[| f(x) |^2\bigg]_{x = - \infty}^{\infty}
\end{align*} Is this correct? Can we conclude this is finite? How do we deal with the $\int_{\mathbb{R}} | f'(x) |^2 dx$ term? Under the suitable assumptions (in another proof of theorem 1, where $f \in  L^2(\mathbb{R})$ we used this) we can say \begin{equation*}
\int_{\mathbb R^n}  | f'(x) |^2 dx
= \int_{\mathbb R^n}  | \mathcal{F}(f')(x) |^2 dx
= \int_{\mathbb R^n} x^2 | \hat{f}(x) |^2 dx,
\end{equation*} but for this we would need that $f' \in L^2$ .
Our lecture assistant conjectured that we need to require $f' \in L^2$ .
How can we show this is necessary? I know that $\big[| f(x) |^2\big]_{x = - \infty}^{\infty}$ only makes sense for $n = 1$ . How can we generalise it? Can we conclude that it vanishes as $|f(x)| \xrightarrow{x \to \pm \infty} 0$ because $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ ?","['fourier-transform', 'proof-explanation', 'functional-analysis']"

3567274,Is every generator of $Z({\rm Spin}_n^{\epsilon}(q))$ a square element in finite spin group ${\rm Spin}_n^{\epsilon}(q)$?,"A. I wonder if every generator of $Z({\rm Spin}_n^{\epsilon}(q))$ is a square element in ${\rm Spin}_n^{\epsilon}(q)$ ? B. When $Z(\Omega_{2m}^{\epsilon}(q))\cong C_2$ , is the generator of $Z(\Omega_{2m}^{\epsilon}(q))$ a square element in $\Omega_{2m}^{\epsilon}(q)$ ？ Note. Here the ground field is a finite field $F_q$ with $q$ a power of some odd prime $p$ . The following follows from 'simple groups of Lie type' by Roger W. Carter. A Lie algebra is a vector space $L$ over a field $K$ on which a product operation $[xy]$ is defined satisfying the following axioms: (i) $[xy]$ is bilinear for $x, y\in L$ . (ii) $[xx]=0$ for $x\in L$ . (iii) $[[xy]z]+[[yz]x]+[[zx]y]=0$ for $x, y, z\in L$ . for each element $x$ of a Lie algebra $L$ we define a map ${\rm ad}~x$ of $L$ into itself by $${\rm ad}~x.y=[xy],~~~y\in L.$$ For each $x,y\in L$ we define the scalar product $(x,y)=tr(ad~x.ad~y)$ , which is called the Killing form. The dimension of the Cartan subalgebras $H$ of $L$ is called the rank of $L$ , and will usually be denoted by $l$ . Although the roots are defined as elements of the dual space of $H$ they can, by considering the Killing form, be regarded as elements of $H$ itself. Each element of the dual space of $H$ is expressible in the form $h\rightarrow (x, h)$ for a unique element $x\in H$ . The element $x$ is associated with the map $h\rightarrow r(h)$ may be identified with the root $r$ . Thus $r$ can be regarded either as an element of $H$ or an element of its dual space; the relation between these two being given by $$r(h)=(r, h),~~~h\in H.$$ We now define the Dynkin diagram of the Lie algebra $L$ . This is a graph with $l$ nodes, one associated with each fundamental root $p_i$ , such that the $i$ th node is joined to the $j$ th node by a bond of strength $n_{ij}$ . Let $L$ be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic $0$ and $\delta$ be a derivation of $L$ which is nilpotent, i.e. satisfies $\delta^n=0$ for some $n$ . Then $${\rm exp}~\delta=1+\delta+\frac{\delta^2}{2!}+...+\frac{\delta^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}$$ is an sutomorphism of $L$ . We write $x_r(\zeta)={\rm exp}(\zeta ad~e_r)$ for $\zeta\in \mathbb{C}$ . We shall write $h_r$ for $\bar{h}_r$ , $e_r$ for $\bar{e}_r$ , $x_r(t)$ for $\bar{x}_r(t)$ , and $A_r(t)$ for $\bar{A}_r(t)$ . This omission of the bars will not lead to confusion or inconsistency since the objects originaly called $h_r$ , $e_r$ , $x_r(t)$ , $A_r(t)$ are special cases of $\bar{h}_r$ , $\bar{e}_r$ , $\bar{x}_r(t)$ , $\bar{A}_r(t)$ when $K=\mathbb{C}$ . The Chevalley group of type $L$ over the field $K$ , denoted by $L(K)$ , is defined to be the group of automorphisms of the Lie algebra $L_K$ generated by the $x_r(t)$ for all $r\in \Phi$ , $t\in K$ . We now consider the special case in which the base field $K$ is the finite field $GF(q)$ with $q$ elements, where $q$ is an arbitrary prime power. $G$ is then a group of non-singular linear transformations of a space over a finite field, so is a finite group. The Chevalley group of  type $L$ over $GF(q)$ will be denoted by $L(q)$ . Theorem 12.1.1 Let $L$ be a simple Lie algebra with $L\neq A_1$ and let $K$ be a field. For each root $r$ of $L$ and each element $t$ of $K$ introduce a symbol $\bar{x}_r(t)$ . Let $\bar{G}$ be the abstract group generated by the elements $\bar{x}_r(t)$ subject to relations $$\bar{x}_r(t_1)\bar{x}_r(t_1)=\bar{x}_r(t_1+t_2),$$ $$[\bar{x}_s(u),\bar{x}_r(t)]=\prod_{i,j>0}\bar{x}_{ir+js}(C_{ijrs}(-t)^iu^j),$$ $$\bar{h}_r(t_1)\bar{h}_r(t_2)=\bar{h}_r(t_1t_2),~~~t_1t_2\neq 0,$$ and $$\bar{n}_r(t)=\bar{x}_r(t)\bar{x}_{-r}(-t^{-1})\bar{x}_{r}{(t)}.$$ Let $\bar{Z}$ be the centre of $\bar{G}$ . Then $\bar{G}/{\bar{Z}}$ is isomorphic to the Chevalley group $G=L(K)$ . The following notations and consequces are followed from 'Classical groups and geometric algebra' by Larry C. Grove. A bilinear form on $V$ is a function $B: V\times V\rightarrow F$ that becomes a linear fouctional in either variable if the other variable is fixed. Suppose that $B$ is a bilinear form on $V$ . Say that $B$ is symmetric if $B(v,w)=B(w,v)$ for all $v,w\in V$ . Suppose that $B_1,B_2$ are bilinear forms on spaces $V_1$ , $V_2$ , respectively. An isometry relative to $B_1$ and $B_2$ is an $F$ -isomorphism $\sigma: V_1\rightarrow V_2$ satisfying $B_2(\sigma v,\sigma w)=B_1(v,w)$ for all $v, w\in V_1$ . If $B$ is a symmetric form on $V$ define $Q: V\rightarrow F$ via $Q(v)=B(v,v)$ , and call $Q$ the associated quadratic form. Through this chapter we assume that $V$ is a quadratic space of dimension $n\geq 2$ over a filed $F$ , with ${\rm char}~F\neq 2$ . The isometries of $V$ are called orthogonal (linear) transformations; they comprise the orthogonal group $O(V)$ . Thus $$O(V)=\{\tau\in {\rm GL}(V): B(\tau u,\tau v)=B(u,v),~{\rm all} u,v\in V\}\leq {\rm GL}(V).$$ Equivalently $\tau\in O(V)$ if and only if $Q(\tau v)=Q(v)$ , all $v\in V.$ If ${\rm det}~\tau=1$ call $\tau$ a rotation, or a proper orthogonal transformation. If ${\rm det}~\tau=-1$ call $\tau$ a reversion, or (more commonly) an improper orthogonal transformation. The rotations in $O(V)$ form a subgroup which will be denoted $SO(V)$ , called the special orthogonal group-it is often denoted by $O^+(V)$ or $O_+(V)$ in the leterature. Let $u\in V$ be any nonzero anisotropic vector (i.e. $Q(u)\neq 0$ ) and define a linear transformation $\sigma_u$ via $$\sigma_u(v)=v-2\frac{B(v,u)}{Q(u)}\cdot u$$ for all $v\in V$ . Then $$B(\sigma_uv,\sigma_uw)=B(v,w),$$ so $\sigma_u\in O(V)$ .
We call $\sigma_u$ the (orthogonal) reflection along $u$ or through the hyperplane $u^{\perp}$ . Often in literature $\sigma_u$ is called a symmetry, e.g. by Arin in [3]. If $B$ is a symmetric form on $V$ , with quadratic form $Q$ , then $v\in V$ , $v\neq 0$ , is called isotropic if $Q(v)=0$ , anisotropic if $Q(v)\neq 0$ . For convenience, $v=0$ is taken to be anisotropic, even though $Q(0)=0$ . If there exists an isotropic vector then $B$ and $V$ (and $Q$ ) are called isotropic; otherwise they are anisotropic. The dimension $m$ of a maximal totally isotropic subspace of a quadratic space $V$ is called the Witt index of $V$ ; it is denoted varioulsy as $m(V)$ , or $m(B)$ , or $m(Q)$ , or sometimes in the literature by ${\rm ind}(V)$ , etc. Suppose that $A$ is an (associative) $F$ -algebra with $1$ . Say that $A$ is compatible with the quadratic $Q$ on $V$ if there is a linear transformation $\varphi: V\rightarrow A$ such that $\varphi(v)^2=Q(v).1_A$ for all $v\in V$ . Proposition 8.3. Suppose $A$ is compatible with $Q$ via $\varphi$ and $0\neq v\in V$ . Then $\varphi v$ is unit in $A$ if and only if $v$ is anisotropic in $V$ A Clifford algebra for a quadratic space $V$ is an associative algebra $C$ (with 1) that is compatible with the quadratic form $Q$ of $V$ , via a map $\epsilon: V\rightarrow C$ , and such that give any algebra $A$ compatible with $V$ (i.e. with $Q$ ) via $\varphi: V\rightarrow A$ , then there exists a unique algebra homomorphism $\hat{\varphi}:C\rightarrow A$ so that the diagram $$\epsilon: V\rightarrow C, \varphi: V\rightarrow A, \hat{\varphi}: C\rightarrow A$$ is commutative. The decomposition $C=C_0\oplus C_1$ of the Clifford algebra determines a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ -grading of $C$ . Note that $F\subseteq C_0$ and $V\subseteq C_1$ . If $r, s\in \{0, 1\}$ the $C_rC_s=C_{r+s}$ , the sum $r+s$ being taken ${\rm mod}~2$ . Thus $C_0$ is a subalgebra of $C$ (the even subalgebra); the elements of $C_0$ are called even homogeneous of degree 0, and the elements of $C_1$ are called odd homogeneous of degree 1. Proposition 8.15. If $V$ is a quadratic space there is a unique anti-automorphism $\alpha: C(V)\rightarrow C(V)$ with $\alpha_V=1_V$ . By definition there is then a unique isomorphism $\alpha: C\rightarrow C^{op}$ such that $\alpha|V=1_V$ , which means that $\alpha:C\rightarrow C$ is an anti-automorphism. Proposition 9.1. Suppose that $u_1, u_2, ..., u_k$ are nonzero anisotropic vectors in $V$ such that $\sigma_{u_1}\sigma_{u_2}...\sigma_{u_k}=1_V$ . Then $\prod_{i=1}^k Q(u_i)\in {F^{\times}}^2$ . Proposition 9.1 is the basis for an important definition. Take $\sigma\in O(V)$ . Then $\sigma$ is a product of reflections in many ways, say e.g. that $\sigma=\sigma_{u_1}...\sigma_{u_r}$ and $\sigma=\sigma_{v_1}...\sigma_{v_s}$ . Then $$\sigma_{u_1}...\sigma_{u_r}\sigma_{v_s}\sigma_{v_1}=1$$ and consequently $$Q(u_1)...Q(u_r)Q(v_s)...Q(v_1)\in {F^{\times}}^2$$ by Proposition 9.1. It follows that $Q(u_1)...Q(u_r)$ and $Q(v_1)...Q(v_s)$ lie in the same coset of ${F^{\times}}^2$ in $F^{\ast}$ , and hence determin a well-defined map $$\theta: O(V)\rightarrow F^{\ast}/{{F^\times}^2},$$ viz. $\theta(\sigma)=Q(u_1)...Q(u_r){F^{\times}}^2$ The map $\theta$ is evidently a homomorphism; it is called the spinor norm on $O(V)$ . The kernel of the restriction to $SO(V)$ of the spinor norm $\theta$ , denoted by $\mho=\mho(V)$ is called the reduced orthogonal group of $V$ (relative, of course, to the given quadratic form). Theorem 9.7. Suppose that $V$ is isotropic. Then $$\mho(V)=\Omega(V),~{\rm and}~SO(V)/\Omega\cong F^{\ast}/{{F^\times}^2}.$$ Let us sketch an alternative approach to $\theta|_{SO(V)}$ . Define the Clifford group $\Gamma=\Gamma(V)$ to be the normalizer in the group $U(C)$ of units in $C$ of the subspace $V$ of $C$ , i.e. $$\Gamma=\{x\in U(C): xvx^{-1}\in V, {\rm all}~\in V\}.$$ Define the even Clifford group to be $\Gamma_0=\Gamma\cap C_0$ . If $x\in V$ is nonzero and anisotropic, and $v\in V$ , then $xvx^{-1}=-\sigma_xv\in V$ by Proposition 8.3, so $O(V)\leq \Gamma$ . It follows easily that $SO(V)\leq \Gamma_0$ . If $x\in \Gamma$ and $v\in V$ define $\chi_x(v)=xvx^{-1}\in V$ . Then $$Q(\chi_xv)=Q(xvx^{-1})=(xvx^{-1})^2=xv^2x^{-1}=xQ(v)x^{-1}=Q(v),$$ so $\chi(x)\in O(V)$ . In fact $\chi$ is a homomorphism from $\Gamma$ into $O(V)$ , called the vector representation of $\Gamma$ . It can be shown that $\chi$ maps $\Gamma_0$ onto $SO(V)$ , with ${\rm Ker}(\chi|{\Gamma_0})=F^\ast$ . If $\alpha$ is the unique anti-automorphism of $C$ with $\alpha_V=1_V$ discussed in Proposition 8.15, then we may define a homomorphism $N: \Gamma_0\rightarrow F^{\ast}$ via $N(x)=\alpha(x)x$ . The kernel of $N$ is called the spin group ${\rm Spin}(V)$ . Then $\chi({\rm Spin}(V))=\mho(V)$ , the reduced orthogonal group. If $\sigma\in SO(V)$ , then there exists $x\in \Gamma_0$ with $\chi(x)=\sigma$ , and then $\theta(\sigma)=N(x)F^{\ast 2}$ gives the spinor norm of $\sigma$ . The following consequence follows from 'Basic algebra I' by Nathan Jacobson. Let $(e_1, e_2, ..., e_n)$ be a base for $V$ and let $\eta\in O(V,Q)$ . Then we have $B(\eta e_i, \eta e_j)=B(e_i,e_j)$ for all $i, j=1,2, ..., n.$ conversely if these conditions hold for a linear transformation $\eta$ , then for any $x=\sum a_ie_i$ we have $Q(\eta x)=Q(x)$ . Thus a linear transformation $\eta$ of $V$ into $V$ is orthogonal if and only if $$(26)~~~B(\eta e_i,\eta e_j)=B(e_i,e_j)~1\leq i, j\leq n.$$ Now let $b=(B(e_i, e_j))$ the matrix of $B$ relative to the base $(e_1,e_2,...,e_n)$ and let $\eta e_i=\sum h_{ij}e_j$ . Then the conditions (26) are that $B(\sum_k h_{ik}e_k, \sum_l h_{jl}e_l)=B(e_i,e_j)$ for all $i$ and $j$ . In matrix form these conditions are $$(27)~~~h\cdot b\cdot {}^th=b~~~{\rm for}~h=(h_{ij}).$$ An orthogonal transformation is called proper or a  rotation if ${\rm det}~h=1$ ; otherwise, the transformation is improper. If we choose an orthogonal base for $V$ , then the matrix $b$ of $B$ is diagonal. Then it is clear that any diagonal matrix with diagonal entries $1$ or $-1$ satisfies (27) and hence determines an orthogonal transformation. Moreover, this is  proper or improper according as the number of -1's is even or odd. It is clear that the set $O^+{V,Q}$ of rotations is a normal subgroup of index two in $O(V,Q)$ . If $B$ is a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, then $B$ is called isotropic or a null form if there exists a vector $u\neq 0$ such that $B(u,u)=0$ . Such a vector is called isotropic. In the case of a finite field the Witt index is always positive if $n\geq 3$ . The following consequence follows form 'Basic algebra II' by Nathan Jacobson. Definition 4.5. Let $V$ be a vector space voer a field $F$ , $Q$ a quadratic form on $V$ . Let $T(V)=F\oplus V\oplus(V\otimes V)\oplus (V\otimes V\otimes V)\oplus ...$ be the tensor algebra defined by $V$ (p. 140) and let $K_Q$ be the ideal in $T(V)$ generated by all of the elements of the form $$(45)~~~x\otimes x-Q(x)1,~~~x\in V$$ Then we definet the Clifford algebra of the quadratic form $Q$ to be the algebra $$C(V,Q)=T(V)/{K_Q}.$$ In the remaider of this section, we shall give a brief indiction of some applications of Clifford algebras to the strudy of orthogonal groups. For this purpose, we need to introduce the even (or second) Clifford algebra $C^+(V,Q)$ defined to be the subalgebra of $C(V,Q)$ geneated by all of the products $uv$ , $u,v\in V$ (that is, by $V^2$ ). Definition 4.6. The Clifford group $\Gamma(V,Q)$ is the subgroup of invertible elements $u\in C(V,Q)$ such that $uxu^{-1}\in V$ for all $x\in V$ . Clearly this is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of invertible elements of $C(V,Q)$ . The even Clifford group is $\Gamma^+(V,Q)=\Gamma(V,Q)\cap C^+(V,Q)$ . If $x\in V$ and $u\in \Gamma=\Gamma(V,Q)$ , then $uxu^{-1}\in V$ and $(uxu^{-1})^2=ux^2u^{-1}=Q(x)1$ . Hence the linear transformation $x\mapsto uxu^{-1}$ of $V$ is in the orthogonal group $O(V,Q)$ . The map $\chi$ , where $\chi(u)$ is $x\mapsto uxu^{-1},x\in V$ , is a homomorphism of $\Gamma(V,Q)$ into $O(V,Q)$ called the vector representation of the Clifford group. Definition 4.7. The kernel of the homomorphism $N$ of $\Gamma^+$ into $F^*$ is called the spin group ${\rm Spin}(V,Q)$ . Its image $O'(V,Q)$ under the vector representation $\chi$ is called the reduced orthogonal group. If $f$ is any rotation and $\chi(u)=f$ , then $N(u){F^{*}}^2$ is called the spinorial norm of $f$ . The spinorial norm map is also a homomorphism (of $O^+(V,Q)$ into $F^*/{{F^*}^2}$ ). The spinorial norm of a rotation can be defined directly, without the intervention of the Clifford algebra. If $f$ is a given rotation, then we can write $f=S_{v_1}...S_{v_2}$ . and we can simply define the spinoial norm of f to be the coset $\prod_1^{2r}Q(v_i){F^*}^2$ . Since $\chi(v_1...v_{2r})=f$ and $N(v_1...v_{24})=\prod_1^{2r}Q(v_i)$ , this is the same element of $F^*/{{F^*}^2}$ , which we have called the spinorial norm. Now the reduced orthogonal group can also be defined as the kernel of the spinorial norm map. The reduced orthogonal group contains the commutator subgroup $\Omega$ of $O$ . Theorem 4.16. Let $Q$ be of positive Witt index. Then the reduced orthogonal group $O'(V,Q)$ coincides with the commutator subgroup $\Omega$ of $O(V,Q)$ and $$O^+(V,Q)/{O'(V,Q)}\cong F^{\ast}/{F^{\ast 2}}.$$ By 'the finite simple groups' of Robert A. Wilson, we have the following the two results: It is easy to find elements of the spin group which square to $-1$ , and hence the spin group is a proper double cover of the orthogonal group. We write ${\rm Spin}_n^{\epsilon}(q)$ for this group of shape $2.{\Omega_n^\epsilon}(q)$ . If $n$ is odd, or if $n=2m$ and $q^m\equiv -\epsilon~({\rm mod}~4)$ , then $\Omega_n^\epsilon (q)$ is already simple, and the spin group has the structure $2.\Omega_n^\epsilon (q)$ . If $n=2m$ and $q^m\equiv \epsilon~({\rm mod}~4)$ , then $\Omega_n^\epsilon(q)$ has a centre of order 2, and the spin group has the structure $4.{\rm P\Omega}_n^\epsilon (q)$ if $m$ is odd, and the structure $2^2.{\rm P\Omega}_n^\epsilon (q)$ (necessarily with $\epsilon=+$ ) is $m$ is even. The following follows from 'twisted wreath products and Sylow 2-subgroups of Classical simple groups' by Warren J. Wong. If $O_n$ is an orthogonal group in dimension $n$ over $GF(q)$ , we shall take the quadratic form on the underlying space to be fixed, so that we can define the spinor norm on the whole group $O_n$ , not just on the proper orthogonal group $O_n^{+}$ . If $K_n$ is the kernel of the spinor norm, then $K_n$ has index 2 in $O_n$ , and the intersection $K_n\cap O_n^+$ , which has index $4$ in $O_n$ , is the commuttor subgroup $\Omega_n$ of $O_n$ . First we consider the Sylow 2-subgroup of $K_{2n}$ . For $n=1$ , the group $O_2$ is dihedral, so that its Sylow $2$ -subgroup $R$ is dihedral of order $2^{t+1}$ ; $R=\langle u, v\rangle$ , where $$(23)~u^{2^t}=w^2=1, u^w=u^{-1}.$$ If $q\equiv 1(\rm mod)~4$ , we may take $$u=\begin{pmatrix}\epsilon^{-1}&0\\0&\epsilon\end{pmatrix}, w=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix},$$ where $\epsilon$ is a primitive $2^t$ -th root of 1 in $GF(q)$ If $q\equiv -1(\rm mod)~4$ , we may take $$u=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\-b&a\end{pmatrix}, w=\begin{pmatrix}-1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix},$$ where $a+b\sqrt{-1}$ is a primitive $2^t$ -th root of $1$ in $GF(q^2)$ . In either case, $w$ has spinor norm $1$ , being a symmetry with respect to the hyperplane (line) orthogonal to a vector on which the value of the quadratic form is a square in $GF(q)$ . Thus the Sylow $2$ -subgroup $W$ of $K_2$ contained in $R$ is $\langle u,w\rangle$ , where $v=u^2$ . This is a dihedral group of order $2^t$ : $$(24)~v^{2^t-1}=w^2=1,~v^w=v^{-1}.$$ Put $e=uw$ . Then $e$ has order $2$ , and $R=W\langle e\rangle$ . where $$(25)~v^e=v^{-1},~w^e=vw.$$ For a general value of $n$ , let the direct sum matrix of the above matrix $e$ with the identity matrix of degree $2n-2$ be again denoted as $e$ : $$(26)~\begin{pmatrix}e&0\\0&I\end{pmatrix},$$ Then $e$ is an element of order $2$ in $O_{2n}$ which is not in $K_{2n}$ . If $W$ is a Sylow $2$ -subgroup of $K_{2n}$ normalized by $e$ , and $E=\langle e\rangle$ ,
then te semi-direct product $WE$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup of $O_{2n}$ , and we call the natural representation $$E\rightarrow {\rm Aut}~W$$ as $s_2$ -system of $K_{2n}$ in $O_{2n}$ . We now conside the Sylow 2-subgroups of $\Omega_n$ and of $P\Omega_{2n}=\Omega_{2n}/Z$ , where the centre $Z$ of $\Omega_{2n}$ is a group of order 2 generated by $z=-I$ . For $n=1$ , take the Sylow $2$ -subgorup $R=\langle u, w\rangle$ of $O_2$ as in (23). The corresponding Sylow 2-subgroup $T$ of $\Omega_2$ is the commutator subgroup $\langle v\rangle$ of $R$ , $v=u^2$ , and $z$ is the unique element of order $2$ in $T$ . In this case, $R$ is not a split extension of $T$ . However, for $n>1$ , take $e$ as in (26) and take $$(27)~f=\begin{pmatrix}I_2&0&0\\0&w&0\\0&0&I_{2n-4}\end{pmatrix}$$ where $I_2$ and $I_{2n-4}$ are identity matrices of degrees $2$ and $2n-4$ . Then $f$ lies in $K_{2n}$ but not in $\Omega_{2n}$ , and $e$ and $f$ generate a non-cyclic group $F$ of order $4$ which meets $\Omega_{2n}$ in the identity. If now $T$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup of $\Omega_{2n}$ normalized by $F$ , then the semi-direct product $TF$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup of $O_{2n}$ , and we cal the natural representation $$F\rightarrow {\rm Aut}~T$$ an $s_2$ -system of $\Omega_{2n}$ in $O_{2n}$ . When $n=2$ , we can take $T$ to be the group generated by $$d=\begin{pmatrix}u&0\\0&u^{-1}\end{pmatrix}, g=\begin{pmatrix}u&0\\0&u\end{pmatrix}, h=\begin{pmatrix}0&I\\I&0\end{pmatrix}, k=\begin{pmatrix}0&w\\w&0\end{pmatrix},$$ where $u$ and $w$ are as before and $I$ is the identity matrix of degree 2. We have the relations $$(28)~ d^{2^{t-1}}=g^{2t-1}=z, z^2=h^2=k^2=1,$$ $$d^h=d^{-1}, g^k=g^{-1}, [d,g]=[d,k]=[h,g]=[h,k]=1,$$ so that $T$ is a central product of two dihedral groups of order $2^{t+1}$ , and $z$ is the generator of the centre of $T$ . The action of $F$ and $T$ is given by $$(29)~d^e=g^{-1}, g^e=d^{-1}, h^e=gk, k^e=dh,$$ $$d^f=g, g^f=d, h^f=k, k^f=h.$$ Theorem 10. Let $2^{t+1}$ be the great power of $2$ dividing $q^2-1$ , $F=\langle e,f\rangle$ a non-cyclic group of order $4$ , $T=\langle d, g, h, k\rangle$ the group of order $2^{2t+1}$ given by (28), $z$ the generator of the centre of $T$ , and $$\rho : F\rightarrow {\rm Aut}~T$$ the representation given by (29). Let $C=\langle a, b, c\rangle$ be an elementary Abelian group of order $8$ , $J=\{1,2\}$ and $$\varphi=(F\rightarrow {\rm Aut}~C, CF\rightarrow F\sim S_J)$$ the $r$ -system given by $$a^e=a^f=a, b^e=b^f=b, c^e=ac, c^f=bc,$$ $$a\rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}e&0\\0&e\end{pmatrix}, b\rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}f&0\\0&f\end{pmatrix}, c\rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}, e\rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}e&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}, f\rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}f&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}.$$ If $n=2^m, m\geq 1$ and $M_{m-1}$ is the twisted wreath product of $m-1$ copies of $\varphi$ , then $\rho{\ast}M_{m-1}$ is equivalent with an $s_2$ -system of $\Omega_{2n}$ in $O_{2n}$ , where $O_{2n}=O_{2n}(1,q)$ , and $z\ast 1$ correpsponds to the generator of the centre of $\Omega_{2n}$ . In particular, the Sylow 2-subgroup of $\Omega_{2n}$ is isomorphic with a twisted wreath product $U$ of $T$ with $m-1$ copies of $C$ , and the Sylow 2-subgroup of $P\Omega_{2n}$ is isomorphic with $U/K$ where $K$ is genertated by $z\ast 1\ast...\ast 1$ . The following follows from 'the geometry of the classical groups' by Donald E. Taylor. If $u$ is singular and $v\in \langle u\rangle^\perp$ , we put $$\rho_{u,v}(x):=x+\beta(x,v)u-\beta(x,u)v-Q(v)\beta(x,u)u~~~(11.17)$$ and note that $\rho$ is a well-defined element of $SO(V)$ for fields of all characteristics. Moreover, if $v$ is singular, we obtain the transformation of case II whereas if $v$ is non-singular, we obtain those of case III of the previous section. Following Tamagawa (1958) and Higman (1978) we call $\rho_{u,v}$ a siegel transformation. 11.46 Theorem. If ${\rm dim}~V\geq 3$ , then Witt index of $V$ is at least $1$ , and $\Omega(V)\neq \Omega^+(4,2)$ , then $\Omega(V)$ is generated by the Siegel transformations of $V$ The following follows from 'the subgroup structure of finie classical groups' by Peter B. Kleidman and Martin W. Liebeck $P\Omega_{2m}^+(q)\cong D_m(q)$ for $m\geq 3$ . $P\Omega_{2m}^-(q)\cong {}^2D_m(q)$ for $m\geq 2$ . The following follows from 'atlas of finite groups' by John Horton Conway, R. T. CURTIS, S. P. NORTON, R. A. PARKER, R. A. WILSON and with computational assistance from J. G. THACKRAY. For a $\mathbb{C}G$ -module $V$ with irreducible character $\chi$ we have the Frobenius-Schur indicator $$\nu(\chi) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \chi(g^2),$$ and $\nu(\chi)$ takes one of the values {+1, -1, 0}, as $\chi$ is afforded by a real representation or is real-valued but not afforded by a real representation or is not real-valued, respectively. The following conseqences are followed by number theory and representation theory of finite groups. It is well known, and easy to derive from the orthogonality relations for group characters and properties of the Frobenius-Schur indicator $\nu$ that $z$ is a square in $G$ if and only if $$\sum_{ \chi \in {\rm Irr}(G)} \nu(\chi) \chi(z) > 0.$$ When $m$ is an even integer and $q$ a power of a odd prime, then $q^m\equiv 1~{\rm mod~4}$ .

3567445,Proof verification for exercise 3.5.2 in Tao's Analysis I: Prove that the generalized definition of a Cartesian product is a set,"The second portion of Exercise 3.5.2 in Tao's Analysis I reads as follows: Suppose we define an ordered $n$ -tuple to be a surjective function $x:\{i \in \mathbb N : 1 \leq i \leq n \} \to X$ whose range is some arbitrary set $X$ (so different ordered $n$ -tuples are allowed to have different ranges); we then write $x_i$ for $x(i)$ , and also write $x$ as $(x_i)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ . Show that if $(X_i)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ are an ordered $n$ -tuple of sets, then the Cartesian product, as defined in Definition 3.5.7, is indeed a set. (Hint: use exercise 3.4.7 and the axiom of specification. Definition 3.5.7 : $\prod\limits_{1\leq i \leq n } X_i :=\{(x_i)_{1\leq i \leq n}:x_i \in X_i \text{ for all } 1 \leq i \leq n \}$ . Conclusion of Exercise 3.4.7 (proven earlier): The collection of all partial functions from $X$ to $Y$ is itself a set. Here, a partial function from $X$ to $Y$ is defined as any function $f: X' \to Y'$ whose domain $X'$ is a subset of $X$ and whose range $Y'$ is a subset of $Y$ . Axiom of Specification : Let $A$ be a set, and for each $x \in A$ , let $P(x)$ be a property pertaining to $x$ . Then there exists a set, called $\{x \in A: P(x) \text{ is true}\}$ whose elements are precisely the elements $x$ in $A$ for which $P(x)$ is true. I am seeking clarification regarding the validity of my proof. I also invoked the Axiom of Union , which Tao states as follows: Let $A$ be a set, all of whose elements are themselves sets. Then there exists a set $\bigcup A$ whose elements are precisely those objects which are elements of the elements of $A$ . Here is the proof: Assume there exists a set $\mathbb W = \{A,B,C,D,...\}$ Let $X$ be a function defined as $X:\{1,2,...,n\} \to \mathbb W$ .
Therefore, as a hypothetical example, $X_1 = A$ , $X_2 =D$ , etc. (Here, $X_1=A$ can be interpreted to mean $X(1)=A$ ...i.e. $X$ is mapping the element $1$ to the set $A$ ) Consider the overarching domain and codomain: $ \mathbb N \to \bigcup \mathbb W$ . Let $\Psi ': \{1,2,...,n\} \to Y'$ where $Y' \subseteq \bigcup \mathbb W$ and, obviously, $\{1,2,...,n\} \subseteq \mathbb N$ . Clearly, $\Psi'$ is a partial function from $ \mathbb N \to \bigcup \mathbb W$ . Let $\Omega$ be the set of all partial functions, of which $\Psi'$ is certainly a member. (This set exists by exercise 3.4.7) Now, let's further equip $\Psi'$ with some arbitrary (but strategic) mapping rule of the following form: $\Psi': 1 \mapsto a' \in X_1$ , $\Psi': 2 \mapsto b' \in X_2$ , $\Psi': 3 \mapsto c' \in X_3$ , ... etc. In line with Tao's notation, we would say $\Psi'_1 = \Psi' (1) = a'$ . We can imagine that there are many other partial functions in $\Omega$ that share a similar mapping strategy to $\Psi'$ . For example, $\Psi'': \{1,2,...,n\} \to Y''$ where $\Psi'': 1 \mapsto a'' \in X_1$ , $\Psi'': 2 \mapsto b'' \in X_2$ , $\Psi'': 3 \mapsto c'' \in X_3$ , ... etc. It is apparent that $\Psi'$ (and its other variants) are behaving like the ordered $n$ -tuple function $(x_i)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ that Tao described earlier. Therefore, using the Axiom of Specification , we can hand pick these functions from $\Omega$ and form a set out of them: $\{\Psi:\Psi \in \Omega\ \text { and }\forall i \text { such that  } 1 \leq i \leq n \ \Psi_i \in X_i \}$ My claim is that this is identical to the Cartesian set definition and therefore I have demonstrated that this is, indeed, a set. Any critiques would be greatly appreciated! Cheers~","['functions', 'solution-verification', 'set-theory']"

Now, I want to prove $h$ is differentiable at $y$ , i.e. there exists matrix $M(y) \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times n}$ such that $$\frac{\Big |h(x) - h(y) - M(y)(x - y) \Big |}{|x - y|} < \epsilon \, \, \,\, \,\, \,\, \,\, \,\, \,\, \, (1)$$ Fix some $\epsilon> 0$ Let's consider $M(y) = g(y)^T df(y) + f(y)^T dg(y)$ . Further define: $F(x, y) = f(x) - f(y) - df(y)(x - y)$ $G(x, y) = g(x) - g(y) - dg(y)(x - y)$ Then, after a lot of simplification, I got that $|h(x) - h(y) - M(y)(x - y)|$ is equal to: $$\big |g(y)^T F(x, y) + f(y)^T G(x, y) + \left( g(x) - g(y) \right).\left( f(x)-f(y) \right) \big|$$ Then we have: \begin{align*}

\end{align*} Since $f$ is differentiable at $y$ , there exists $\delta_1 > 0$ such that $|x - y| < \delta_1$ $\implies $ $\frac{|F(x, y)|}{|x - y|} < \frac{\epsilon}{3 \, |g(y)|}$ . Since $g$ is differentiable at $y$ , there exists $\delta_2 > 0$ such that $|x - y| < \delta_2$ $\implies $ $\frac{|G(x, y)|}{|x - y|} < \frac{\epsilon}{3 \,|f(y)|}$ . As $x \to y$ , we have $\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x - y|} \to |f'(y)|$ Since $g$ is continuous at $y$ , there exists $\delta_3 > 0$ such that $|x - y| < \delta_3$ $\implies $ $|g(x) - g(y)| < \frac{\epsilon}{3 |f'(y)|}$ Note that $y$ is fixed so the above 4 points make sense.

3567716,Volumes and surface areas for the $d-$sphere $S^d$ rather than the $d-$ball.,"I've been struggling with the concept of volume and surface area for the $d-$ sphere $S^d$ . For concreteness, I can give the $d-$ sphere of radius $R$ an extrinsic definition by embedding it in $(d+1)-$ dimensional Euclidean space: $$S^d = \{x\in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}: |x|=R\}$$ (although I can't see how one defines this intrinsically, any suggestions?) $S^d$ is a d-dimensional manifold without boundary. My confusion begins from here: Does it make sense to talk about the volume of $S^d$ given that it's merely a spherical shell and isn't ""solid"" in the conventional sense? Presumably, it's volume should be zero when viewed as an embedding in $R^{d+1}$ ? Note: I stress, I'm not asking for the volume of the region in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ enclosed by this spherical surface, but rather the volume of the shell $S^d$ itself. What is the precise definition for the volume of a manifold without boundary? Does it make sense to speak of a surface area of $S^d$ given that it has no boundary itself? What is the precise definition for the surface area of a manifold without boundary? Note, I can see both concepts being totally clear for the $(d+1)-$ ball because: The $(d+1)-$ ball is ""solid"" in $(d+1)-$ dimensional space and has a boundary $S^d$ , so the concept of volume is intuitively clear to me here. The surface area of the $(d+1)-$ ball is equally easy to visualise given that it possesses a boundary, and one would get the usual ""surface area of a sphere"". But, surely, the surface area of $B^{d+1}$ and the surface area of $S^{d}$ cannot be defined in the same way, whilst also giving the same answer? I just can't make sense of this question when I consider $S^d$ as a manifold in it's own right, rather than through embedding. For instance, the volume of the closed unit disk $B^2$ in two dimensions is clearly $V(B^2)=\pi R^2$ , and the surface area is corresponding the circumference of the boundary $S^1$ : $A(B^2) = 2\pi R$ . My question is, what are $V(S^1)$ and $A(S^1)$ exactly? Is $V(S^1) = A(B^2)$ ? If there are issues with the small dimensionality here, one can ask the same question for $B^3$ and $S^2$ . I appreciate that this question is very muddled, so please fire away for any clarifications. It has very been painful to search the internet for answers to this.","['spheres', 'geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

One of the disks is transparent, and the other one is not. One of the disks is chosen for every pair. The disks are arbitrarily placed on a stake. In how many ways can you choose and stack the disks such that all the edges of the $n$ disks are visible from above? I thought there are $2^n$ ways to choose the disks (you can either choose the transparent or the opaque disk for all of the $n$ pairs). If you choose only opaque disks, then you there is only $1$ option to place the disks. If you choose only transparent disks, then it doesn't matter what order they are stacked, so you can stack them in $n!$ ways.

(This is equivalent to bounding the induced norm $\|M\|_{s'\to s}$ .)
I have that $M=\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&a\end{bmatrix}$ has all positive values and $a\ge\max\{b,c\}$ , so $M$ is positive semidefinite. I can thus think of this as comparing a unit ball to another unit ball, given a simple rotation, shearing and scaling of the axes. W.log. I can assume $\|x\|_s=1$ .
I have identified the four points in which the two unit-balls touch each other. (See the picture below for an example.) I now want to prove that the two balls can not touch each other in more than the four points I have identified. This seems to stem from the fact that $\ell_p$ unit-balls are somewhat ""square"", since e.g. hexagonal unit-balls could of course easily have more points of touch. I don't know how to formalize this ""squareness"" however. I don't know if it is necessary that one of the norms is the dual norm to the other (i.e. $\frac 1s+\frac1{s'}=1$ ), but it probably is required that $s,s'\ge 1$ .

3568021,Introduction to category theory with examples in probability/statistics,"I'm thinking of starting a reading group on category theory. The members (myself included) will likely be people trained in natural sciences rather than mathematics, and will probably all have backgrounds in information theory and statistics. Not necessarily measure theory but graphical models, Markov processes, machine learning, that sort of thing. Because of this, I'm wondering if there is an introductory book or paper that draws some of its examples from these fields. In all of the introductory texts I found so far, including those aimed at scientists, probability seems to be treated as something of an advanced topic, with the result that we can't easily use it to prime our intuitions early on in the way that I would like. On the other hand, I know that there are some interesting and useful applications of category theory to probability, both in the form of classic works (the Giry monad etc.), and the more recent stuff from John Baez' group, which is what I really want us to learn about. The issue is just that this stuff isn't very accessible to a beginner, so you have to go on quite a long journey to learn the relevant concepts in some other context, before you can have a chance of understanding it. Broadly speaking, we'd be aiming towards the topics that fall under ""applied category theory"" (i.e. monoidal categories and their applications), though we may find we want to spend some time on the basics first. To illustrate what I mean, here are some of the more applied introductions to categories that I know about: Fong & Spivak - Seven sketches in compositionality : doesn't cover probability at all. Spivak - Category theory for scientists : covers probability only in a short section in chapter 5, and doesn't develop it much further than the definition. Baez & Stay - Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone : doesn't cover probability at all. Coecke & Paquette - Categories for the practicing physicist : it's concerned largely with Hilbert spaces but spends little time on their relationship to probability, and doesn't mention classical probability at all. Ideally, I'm looking for something along the lines of these works, but with more of an emphasis on probability, especially from the perspective of Bayesian networks, machine learning, etc., if it exists. Otherwise, any introductory text that has at least some examples from these fields would be very useful! We may also consider tackling one of the classic mathematical textbooks (e.g. Mac Lane, Lawvere etc.), but these also tend not to mention probability. If there is something along those lines that does, that would be useful too.","['book-recommendation', 'probability-theory', 'category-theory', 'reference-request']"

Problem 5-12. Suppose $E$ and $M$ are connected smooth manifolds with boundary, and $\pi : E \to M$ is a smooth covering map, i.e. $\pi$ is smooth surjective and each point in $M$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that each component of $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is mapped diffeomorphically onto $U$ by $\pi$ . Show that the restriction of $\pi $ to each connected component of $\partial E$ is a smooth covering map onto a component of $\partial M$ . My attempt so far: Let $F$ be a connected component of $\partial E$ . Let $x \in \pi(F)$ , and let $U$ be an evenly covered neighborhood of $x$ . Take $e \in F$ such that $\pi(e)=x$ . Let $\tilde U$ be the component of $\pi^{-1}(U)$ containing $e$ . Then $\pi|_{\tilde U} : \tilde{U} \to U$ is a diffeomorphism by assumption. Since $\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism, $\pi$ maps boundary points to boundary points, so we have $\pi(\tilde{U} \cap F) = U \cap \partial M$ . But this is not really getting me further. I need to show that first, the image $\pi(F)$ is a connected component of $\partial M$ . And then for each $x \in \pi(F)$ , there is an evenly covered neighborhood $U$ such that each component of $\pi^{-1}(U) \cap F$ is mapped diffeomorphically onto $U \cap \pi(F)$ by $\pi$ .

The difficult is that for each triangle SVX and XES I know only one angle and one line - A and B are known and the SV line and SE line are known. Given that information only, I can't figure out how to calculate the circles with my barely remembered high school math. If someone could point me in the right direction to do this, that would be much appreciated.","['trigonometry', 'circles', 'geometry']"
3568819,Primality test involving quartic fields and polynomials,"Let $n$ be an odd number, $D=a^2+4$ and $(D | n)=-1$ where $(D | n)$ is the Jacobi symbol. Then $n$ is prime if and only if $(x^2 + ax)^n = x^3 - x^2 + (D-2)x - D \pmod {{x^4 + Dx^2 + D},n}$ or $(x^2 - ax)^n = x^3 - x^2 + (D-2)x - D \pmod {{x^4 + Dx^2 + D},n}$ I have constructed a proof ( here ) for the converse of this test but not the actual test itself. Are there counterexamples? A heuristic argument suggesting a counterexample? There are no counterexamples for any $(|a|,n) < 10000$ . The idea for this algorithm came from a version of Agrawal's Conjecture with $r=5$ involving a quartic polynomial, without resorting to higher-degree polynomials (larger values of $r$ ). It is much easier to use a constructed family of cyclic quartic polynomials with one free parameter. You can run the test here; Also related is this conjecture/test here (which also gave me an idea for this test).","['number-theory', 'primality-test', 'elementary-number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"
3568861,Space of positive measures Polish for a weak-star topology?,"Let $X$ be a second-countable locally compact Hausdorff space. Denote by $C_c(X) \subseteq C_0(X) \subseteq C_b(X)$ the spaces of continuous functions with compact support, vanishing at infinity and those that are bounded respectively. Denote by $M(X) = C_0(X)' = C_c(X)'$ the space of signed Radon measures on $X$ , where $C_0(X)$ or $C_c(X)$ carry the supremum norm ( $C_c$ is dense in $C_0$ ). On $M(X)$ we can consider the weak $^*$ topologies $w^*_c \subseteq w^*_0 \subseteq w^*_b$ relative to $C_c$ , $C_0$ and $C_b$ . On the set of positive Radon measures $M^+(X)$ , the topologies $w^*_c$ and $w^*_b$ are Polish (i.e. completely metrizable and separable). A compatible complete metric for $w^*_b$ on $M^+$ is given by the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm [Bogachev, ""Measure Theory II"", Theorem 8.3.2]. A compatible complete metric for $w^*_c$ on $M^+$ is typically constructed from a countable dense subset $\{ f_n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \} \subseteq C_c(X)$ ( $C_0$ and $C_c$ are separable), e.g. $d(\mu, \nu) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} min(1, |\int f_n d\mu - \int f_n d\nu|)$ . In the literature on measure and probablity theory I mostly find discussions around these two topologies ( $w^*_c$ is called the vague topology and $w^*_b$ the narrow topology). Of course, $w^*_0 = w^*_c$ on norm-bounded sets of $M(X)$ , but the topology $w^*_0$ seems to be more natural on $M(X)$ , simply because $(M(X), w^*_0)$ is the weak $^*$ -dual of a Banach space ( $C_0$ ); $C_c$ is only a normed space. On $M^+(X)$ these three topologies are generally different. For instance, if $X = \mathbb{N}$ , then (i) $n \delta_n \to 0$ for $w^*_c$ but not for $w^*_0$ ( $n \delta_n$ is not norm bounded) and (ii) $\delta_n \to 0$ for $w^*_0$ but not for $w^*_b$ ( $\delta_n$ is not tight). Questions: Is the $w^*_0$ topology also Polish on $M^+(X)$ ? Can anyone provide a reference for properties of this topology (on all of $M(X)$ or $M^+(X)$ )? [Note that the one-point compactification $X \to X_\infty$ induces an embedding of $M^+(X)$ as a closed subset of the Polish space $(M^+(X_\infty), w^*)$ with $w^* = \sigma(M(X_\infty), C(X_\infty))$ , but the subspace topology induced on $M^+(X)$ is finer than $w^*_0$ (it can be shown that $w^* = w^*_b$ on $M^+(X)$ ).]","['descriptive-set-theory', 'measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'reference-request']"

Let $Z \subset X$ be an irreducible component of $f^{-1}(Y')$ , whose generic point $\zeta$ maps to $\eta'$ .

I think this would imply that the closures $Y_i = \overline{\{f(\zeta_i)\}}$ form a chain of irreducible closed subsets containing $Y'$ . But I only know that $f(\zeta_1) \neq \eta'$ , because otherwise $Z_1$ would be contained in $f^{-1}(Y')$ , which contradicts the assumption that $Z$ is an irreducible component, and also $f(\zeta_r) = \eta$ , there generic point of $Y$ .
