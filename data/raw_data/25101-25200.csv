225673,intrinsic proof that the grassmannian is a manifold,"I was trying to prove that the grassmannian is a manifold without picking bases, is that possible? Here's what I've got, let's start from projective space.
Take $V$ a vector space of dimension n, and $P(V)$ its projective space. To imitate the standard open sets when you have a basis, consider a hyperplane $H$. We can form a (candidate open) subset $U_H$ consisting of those lines $L \in P(V)$ such that $L \oplus H = V$. For the Grassmannian you can proceed similarly, say you want to construct $Gr(d,V)$. Take a subspace H of dimension $c = n - d$, and consider the set $U_H$ of those subspaces $W \in Gr(d,V)$ such that $W \oplus H = V$. I'm not really sure how to proceed after this. Any hints? the main problem is that $U_H$ should be isomorphic to affine space but I can't seem to cook up the natural candidate for it.","['manifolds', 'algebraic-geometry', 'grassmannian', 'differential-geometry']"

225730,Left adjoint and right adjoint/ Nakayama isomorphism,"I am reading a paper ""2-vector spaces and groupoid"" by Jeffrey Morton and I need a help to understand the following. Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite groupoids.  Let $[X, \mathbb{Vect}]$ be a functor category from $X$ to $\mathbb{Vect}$. Suppose we have a functor $f: Y \rightarrow X$. The author defines a pushforward $f_{*} :[Y, \mathbb{Vect}] \rightarrow [X, \mathbb{Vect}]$ as follows. For each object $x \in X$, the comma category $(f \downarrow x)$ has object which are objects $y \in Y$ with maps $f(y) \rightarrow x$ in $X$, and morphisms which are morphisms $a: y \rightarrow y'$ whose images make the evident triangle in $X$ commute. Then the author defines for each $F\in [Y, \mathbb{Vect}]$, $f_{*}(F)(x):=colim F(f \downarrow x)$. He also shows that $f_{*}(F)(y)=\bigoplus_{f(x)\cong y} \mathbb{C}[Aut(y)]\otimes_{\mathbb{C}[Aut(x)]}F(x)$ and fimilarly calculate $f^*f_*$ and $f_*f^*$. Later he says that this description accords with the susal description of these functors in the left adjunction. Then he mentions that the right adjoint is given as $f_*F(x)= \bigoplus_{[y], f(y)\cong x}hom_{\mathbb{C}[Aut(x)]}(\mathbb{C}[Aut(y), F(y)).$ Then we says: The Nalayama isomorphism gives the duality between the two descriptions of $f_*$, in terms of $hom_{\mathbb{C}[Aut(x)]}$ and $\otimes_{\mathbb{C}[Aut(x)]}$ by means of the exterior trace map. I understood the calculation of $f_*F(x)$ using a colimit defined above. But I don't know what it means by saying left or right adjoint. Also I don't know how to get the formula for the right adjoint. I even don't know what is Nakayama isomorphism. I searched for it but I couldn't find a good resource. So I would like to know what is going on here. Especially, I'd like to know; Why is the first construction using a colimit called ""left adjoint""? What is the right adjoint and how is it defined and how to calculate it to get the formula above. What is Nakayama isomorphism? I have never studied these things so I don't know where to look up. I also want good references. I appreciate any help. Thank you in advance.","['algebraic-geometry', 'representation-theory', 'algebraic-topology', 'abstract-algebra', 'category-theory']"

225743,Why are there $\frac{(2n)!}{2^nn!}$ ways to break $2n$ people into partnerships?,"Apparently, there are $\frac{(2n)!}{2^nn!}$ ways to break $2n$ people into partnerships. Why? An explanation reads that there are $2n!$ ways to line people up. If we just pair adjacent people in the line up, we would have overcounted. So we must divide by $2^n n!$. My question is why do we divide by $2^n n!$ specifically to adjust for overcounting?

225810,Example of integration over path on Riemann surface,"Let $X$ be a Riemann surface
$$
   X = \left\{ (z,w) \in \mathbb{C}^2 \mid z^3 + w^3 = 1 \right\}.
$$
Then we have $z^2 dz + w^2 dw = 0$ and we can define a holomorphic form $\omega$ on $X$ by
$$
   \omega = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl} \frac{dz}{w}, & w \neq 0 \\ -\frac{wdw}{z^2}, & z \neq 0 \end{array} \right.
$$
Let $j = e^{\frac{2 i\pi}{3}}$ and $\gamma$ be a path on $\mathbb{C}_{z}$ given by the following image: $\hskip4cm $ Let $\Gamma$ denote a closed path on $X$ obtained by lifting $\gamma$ and such that $\Gamma$ passes through $(0,1)$, and let $\Gamma_j$ denote a lifting of its part $\gamma_j$. $\hskip3cm $ We will integrate $\omega$ over $\Gamma$. Let's start from $z = 0$ and move right. We have
$$
   \int\limits_{\Gamma_1} \omega = \int\limits_{0}^{1-\varepsilon} \frac{dt}{(1-t^3)^{1/3}} =: I_{\varepsilon}\;.
$$
Next we compute $\int_{\Gamma_2} \omega$. We can use the parametrisation 
$z = 1 + \varepsilon e^{i \varphi}$, $\phi \in [-\pi,\pi]$ and
$$w = (1-(1+\varepsilon e^{i \varphi})^3)^{1/3} = (-\varepsilon e^{i \varphi}(3 + 3 \varepsilon e^{i \varphi} + \varepsilon^2 e^{2i \varphi}))^{1/3}\;.$$ 
For sufficiently small $\varepsilon$ we have $|w| \geqslant |\varepsilon|^{1/3} C_{1}$ on $\Gamma_2 = \Gamma_2(\varepsilon)$. Then 
$$
   \left| \int\limits_{\Gamma_2} \omega \right| \leqslant \int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{| \varepsilon i e^{i \varphi} | dt}{|w|} \leqslant C_{2} \varepsilon^{2/3} \to 0\text{ when }\varepsilon \to 0.
$$
Using same techniques we obtain that $\int_{\Gamma_5} \omega$ and $\int_{\Gamma_8}\omega$ tend to $0$ when $\varepsilon \to 0$. Now we compute $\int_{\Gamma_3} \omega$. Let's remark that $w = \sqrt[3]{1-z^3} = \sqrt[3]{(1-z)(j-z)(j^2-z)} = \sqrt[3]{1-z}\sqrt[3]{(j-z)(j^2-z)}$. When $z$ goes around $1$ on the curve $\gamma_2$, the first factor's argument increases by $\frac{2 \pi}{3}$ because the argument of $(1-z)$ increases by $2 \pi$. The argument of the second factor in unchanged. Then the integral over $\Gamma_3$ is just
$$
  \int\limits_{\Gamma_3} \omega = \int\limits_{1-\varepsilon}^{0} \frac{dt}{j(1-t^3)^{1/3}} = -j^2 I_{\varepsilon}
$$
since $j^2 = \frac{1}{j}$. To take the integral over $\Gamma_4$ let's remark that $t^3 = (jt)^3$ and then $1-t^3 = 1-(jt)^3$. Then 
$$
   \int\limits_{\Gamma_4} \omega = \int\limits_{0}^{1-\varepsilon} \frac{ j dt}{ j (1-(jt)^3)^{1/3}} = I_{\varepsilon}\;.
$$
Analogously to $\Gamma_3$ we have that $\int_{\Gamma_6} \omega = \int_{\Gamma_9} \omega = -j^2 I_{\varepsilon}$ and $\int_{\Gamma_7} \omega = I_{\varepsilon}$. Since the form $\omega$ is holomorphic on $X$ we must have
$$
   \sum\limits_{k=1}^{9} \int\limits_{\Gamma_k} \omega = I
$$
where $I$ is a so-called period, that doesn't depend on $\varepsilon$. Passing to the limit when $\varepsilon \to 0$ we obtain
$$
   3(1-j^2) \int\limits_{0}^{1} \frac{dt}{(1-t^3)^{1/3}} = I\;.
$$
My question is how to find such period $I$? P.S. By the way, using other techniques (not related to Riemann surfaces) we can show that $$
   \int\limits_{0}^{1} \frac{dt}{(1-t^3)^{1/3}} = \frac{2 \pi}{3 \sqrt{3}}\;.

I have broken the region bounded by the trig functions into 5 subregions in order to avoid integrating across an interval that splits any particular definition for the inverse functions. I know some symmetry could help simplify the calculations but does not help with my misunderstanding: 1) $\arccos(y)\leq x\leq\arcsin(y)\qquad -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq y \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad$ $y$ is decreasing 2) $\arcsin(y)\leq x\leq \frac{\pi}{2} \qquad \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq y\leq 1\qquad$ $y$ is increasing 3) $\frac{\pi}{2}\leq x\leq\arcsin(y) \qquad \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq y \leq 1\qquad$ $y$ is decreasing 4) $\arccos(y)\leq x\leq \pi \qquad -1\leq y\leq-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad$ $y$ is decreasing 5) $\pi\leq x\leq\arccos(y)\qquad -1\leq y\leq-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad$ $y$ is increasing Working through this problem I have tried to reason by looking at increasing or decreasing $y$ in terms of increasing $x$. This seems to work in all regions but 4) and 5). There is a sign change that I cannot account for. So I have the following corresponding integrals for the $dxdy$ integration order: 1) $ \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}^{\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}}\int_{\arccos(y)}^{\arcsin(y)}dxdy = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}$ 2) $ \int_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}^{1}\int_{\arcsin(y)}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}dxdy = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}$ 3) $ \int_{1}^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}\int_{\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\arcsin(y)}dxdy = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}$ 4) $ \int_{\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}}^{-1}\int_{\arccos(y)}^{\pi}dxdy = -\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}\right)$ 5) $ \int_{-1}^{\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}}\int_{\pi}^{\arccos(y)}dxdy = -\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{\pi}{4\sqrt{2}}\right)$ Integrals 4 and 5 evaluate to minus their respective areas. I'm a bit confused as to the reasoning. I think i finally got this one. The bounded region under consideration crosses over the domain of definition for both the $\arcsin(y)$ and $\arccos(y)$. The standard domain of definition for these functions is: $-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq arcsin(y)\leq\frac{\pi}{2}\qquad0\leq\arccos(y)\leq\pi$ The way I finally realized what was happening here was by investigating the graph of the inverse functions on their standard domains and asking myself the following question: How can I continuously extend the graph of these inverses to include the bounded region? From this, one sees that multiplying the $\arcsin(y)$ by -1 and adding $\pi$ provides a continuous extension that covers the bounded region. Likewise for $\arccos(y)$ multiply by -1 and add $2\pi$. With this insight, the region can be broken into 3 subregions: 1) $\arcsin(y)\leq x\leq\pi-\arcsin(y)\qquad \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq y\leq1$ 2) $\arccos(y)\leq x\leq\pi-\arcsin(y)\qquad \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq y\leq\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ 3) $\arccos(y)\leq x\leq2\pi-\arccos(y)\qquad -1\leq y\leq\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}$ The area of the bounded region follows from integrating over these 3 subregions.","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'integration']"

225987,Show group of order $4n + 2$ has a subgroup of index 2.,"Let $n$ be a positive integer. Show that any group of order $4n + 2$ has a subgroup of index 2. (Hint: Use left regular representation and Cauchy's Theorem to get an odd permutation.) I can easily observe that $\vert G \vert = 2(2n + 1)$ so $2 \mid \vert G \vert$ and 2 is prime. We have satisfied the hypothesis of Cauchy's Theorem so we can say $G$ contains an element of order 2. This is where I am stuck I am confused about how the left regular representation relates to the group. So my understanding at this point is that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of some symmetric group. My question: is the left regular representation $\varphi : G \to S_G$ an isomorphism? where $G \cong S_G$ or is $S_G$ the same thing as $S_{\vert G \vert}$ and $\varphi$ is only an injection? I'm using Dummit and Foote for definitions. I saw an argument online that said that since we have an element of order 2, there is a $\sigma \in S_G$ of order 2, but it is a product of $2n + 1$ disjoint 2-cycles. I don't understand how they could claim this and tried working it out on my own but didn't get there. -- They then went on to use the parity mapping $\varepsilon : S_G \to \{\pm1\}$ and since we have an odd permutation $\sigma$, we have $[S_G:\text{ker }\varepsilon] = 2$. I understood their computation but not how that directly shows that $G$ has a subgroup of order 2? unless $G \cong S_G$ because of how left regular representation is defined. (but again, I'm not understanding that concept very well yet.) So, to be clear about my questions: What is meant by left regular representation, is it an isomorphism or just an injection? and how would it be used here. If it is an isomorphism, the argument online starts to make more sense, but how can they say that since $\sigma$ is even, it is made up of $2n + 1$ disjoint transpositions?

When you have a linear operator $T:\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)\rightarrow\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$ or $T:\mathcal{E}'(\Omega)\rightarrow\mathcal{E}'(\Omega)$, I often find it easy to prove that convergent sequences get mapped to convergent sequences (in the weak topology), but proving continuity with respect to the weak topology is much harder. Since these spaces are not first-countable (I think), one must work with a local basis around 0. For example, if you have a pseudodifferential operator $P:\mathcal{E}'(\Omega)\rightarrow\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$ which is properly supported, then it continuously extends to a (necessarily unique) operator $P:\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)\rightarrow\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$ and maps $\mathcal{E}'(\Omega)$ continuously into $\mathcal{E}'(\Omega)$. I was able to prove the first statement, but I was able to prove the second statement only in terms of sequential continuity (and even this was quite difficult). In many textbooks involving distributions, authors don't seem to be careful about this. They give an argument proving sequential continuity and claim that it is continuous in the more general sense.

Prime Nim is a variant of the Nim game where you have a single pile with an arbitrary number $n\in \Bbb N+\{0\}$ of elements and players can take away a prime count of elements every round. Now I want to find a way to decide whether we can ensure victory in a given position (and the winning strategy, of course). What I did so far: $0$ and $1$ are clearly lost positions. On the contrary, any prime $n$ and $n+1$ are winning positions. For all other $n$ we can say that if there is no prime $p<n$ such that $n-p \notin \{n'|n'<n \land n' \text{ is lost}\}$ , then $n$ is a losing position. The set of losing positions can be more formally expressed recursively based on previous such sets for smaller $n$ . (In other words, this is an application of the very basic idea that a position form which we can make no move to a losing position is a losing position). All other positions are winning positions. Very simple and general. Losing positions can be described as a sequence - http://oeis.org/A025043 (quite interestingly a subsequence of http://oeis.org/A093513 ). This uses the recursive nature of the problem. An algorithm starting from the recursion edge case ( $0$ ) and building up the sequence progressively can give us both the answer and the prospective winning strategy generated as a side-product in polynomial time. My lecturer said the strategy-finding algorithm is probably optimal, but he also suggested there might be a simple formula to decide whether a given position can be won using an optimal strategy. And I am stuck on it now. I guess the formula can't possibly be that simple, since it has to, in my opinion, include at least primality testing. I tried to determine a simple way to decide whether a number is in the sequence of losing positions, but I had no success so far.

Unknown is the operation(s) needed in order come to the right solution. That is, we know the values of all values except for the variable s .

Ex values $$1.27 = \frac{39500 \;(?operations?)\; s}{255}\tag{1}$$ $$1.07 = \frac{39500 \;(?operations?)\; s}{241}\tag{2}$$ The attempted solution I took the problem to mean 'Determine the operation(s) needed to prove that s is the same in both this formulas.'

$$1.27 = \frac{(39500 \times s)}{255}$$ $$1.07 = \frac{(39500 \times s )}{241}$$ This attempted solution gives $s = 0.00819873$ and $s = 0.00722325$, but $0.00819873 \neq 0.00722325$; therefore it is not correct.

Motivation and attempt at an answer: The question should be local, so we can base change to get $Y/\mathbb{Q}_p$. Good reduction should mean something like: There exists a regular, proper $\mathcal{Y}/\mathbb{Z}_p$ such that the generic fiber is isomorphic to $Y$ and the special fiber is smooth. This is potentially a bad definition: This behavior for curves of genus $g\geq 1$ is nice, because in the appropriate category of such models there is a partial order by dominating. One can prove that there is a unique, regular, proper, minimal model of the curve which can be used to determine reduction type. (Edited paragraph from comments) Note that given such a minimal model, one can blow up points on the special fiber. These blowups are still generically isomorphisms and hence models. They are no longer minimal, though. Related question 1: For higher dimensional varieties, if you have $2$ minimal, regular, proper models (these may not be unique), if one has a nonsingular special fiber, then must the other as well? This would give a well-defined way to determine reduction type.

Here is my work so far(With edits based on Phyra's suggestions below): $V=f(x,y,z)=xyz$ Subject to two constraints: Surface area: $g(x,y,z)=2xy+2xz+2yz=1500$ Edge length: $h(x,y,z)=4x+4y+4z=200$ Simplify constraints to: $g(x,y,z)=xy+xz+yz=750$ $h(x,y,z)=x+y+z=50$ Solve system of equations: $f_x=yz=\lambda (y+z)+\mu$ $f_y=xz=\lambda (x+z)+\mu$ $f_z=xy=\lambda (x+y)+\mu$ This leads to: $\lambda y+\lambda z+\mu=yz$ $\lambda x+\lambda z+\mu=xz$ $\lambda x+\lambda y+\mu=xy$ Thus, $\lambda x=xy-\lambda y-\mu=xz-\lambda z-\mu$, so that $xy-\lambda y=xz-\lambda z$, which simplifies to: $x(y-z)=\lambda (y-z)$, so that $\lambda=x$ when $(y-z)\ne 0$ Similarly, $\lambda y =yz-\lambda z -\mu=xy-\lambda x -\mu$, so that $y(z-x)=\lambda (z-x)$, and $\lambda = y$ when $(z-x)\ne 0$ Also, $\lambda z = yz-\lambda y -\mu=xz-\lambda x - \mu$, so that $z(y-x)=\lambda (y-x)$, and $\lambda = z$ when $(y-x)\ne 0$ The above can be summarized as: $\lambda=x=y=z  $ Substitute x=y into constraints: $x^2 +2xz =750$ and $2x+z=50$ Substitute $z=50-2x$ into first constraint: $3x^2-100x+750=0$ gives $x=y=\frac{5}{3}(\frac{+}{}\sqrt{10}+10)$ Also, $z=50-2x=\frac{50\frac{+}{}10\sqrt{10}}{3}$ Thus, $V=xyz\approx 2948$ or $\approx 3534$ My remaining questions are as follows: a) What do you mean in your comments below when you refer to checking the border?  This concept is not in my textbook. b) Why choose x=y?  Are you saying that choosing y=z would have given the same result? c) Why use $z=50-2x$ instead of $x=y=z$? d) When you mention 8 cases, to what are you referring?

I know there are only two subgroups and $\langle a\rangle\neq e$ because $a\neq e$. Therefore we must have $G=\langle a\rangle$. But my problem is why cant I say that consider $a,b\in G$ and then we look at $\langle a,b\rangle$.

But what if I have not the abilities or capacities of delving deeper into topos theory and sheaves? Does the deep connection between logic and geometry have to remain a mistery for me forever? At which level of abstraction and sophistication can this connection be recognized for the first time? And which seemingly superficial analogies have really to do with this ""deep connection""? What's rather easy to grasp is that there is (i) an algebra of logic and (ii) an algebra of geometry . But is this at the heart of the ""deep connection""? What comes to my mind is, that both logic (the realm of linguistic representations) and geometry (the realm of graphical representations) have to do with - representations . Is this of any relevance? Edit: I also wonder if and how graph theory can be related to – or serve as a connection between – logic and geometry, the vertices of graphs representing objects (in the sense of logic), resp. points (in the sense of geometry), the edges representing sentences , resp. line segments . If there was such a ""deep connection"" of logic, geometry, and graph theory, the existence and importance of planar graphs might appear in a new light.

Then $C(-)$ becomes a contravariant functor $C(-)\,:\,\bf{Top}\rightarrow \text{ComRing}$. A theorem due to Gelfand and Kolmogorov states the following: Let $X$ and $Y$ be compact Hausdorff spaces. If $C(X)$ and $C(Y)$ are isomorphic as rings, then $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic. I encountered this theorem as an example in a book on homological algebra, without proof.

226768,Example where $\int |f(x)| dx$ is infinite and $\int |f(x)|^2 dx$ is finite,"I read in a book that the condition $\int |f(x)|^2 dx <\infty$ is less restrictive than $\int |f(x)| dx <\infty$. That means whenever $\int |f(x)| dx$ is finite, $\int |f(x)|^2 dx$ is also finite, right? My understanding is that $|f(x)|$ may have a thick tail to make the integral blow up, but $|f(x)|^2$ may decay quickly enough to have a finite integral. Can someone give me an example that $\int |f(x)| dx=\infty$ but $\int |f(x)|^2 dx <\infty$. Suppose $f(x)$ is an absolutely continous function and bounded on $(-\infty, \infty)$.",['integration']

226786,"Let $f(z)$ be entire function. Show that if $f(z)$ is real when $|z| = 1$, then $f(z)$ must be a constant function using Maximum Modulus theorem","Let $f(z)$ be entire function. Consider the functions $e^{if(z)}$ and $e^{−if(z)}$ and applying the Maximum Modulus Theorem, show that if $f(z)$ is real when $|z| = 1$, then $f(z)$ must be a constant function. (We take $f(z)=u(z)+iv(z)$) I am confused as so far I have $|g(z)|=|e^{if(z)}|=|e^{-v(z)}|$ and then since $f(z)$ is real, $f(z)=u(z)$ and $v(z)=0$ so I assumed it would follow that $|g(z)|=|e^{v(z)}|=1$. Similarly, $|g(z)|=|e^{-if(z)}|=|e^{v(z)}|=1$. Using Liouville I assumed one could say that both $g(z)$ and $h(z)$ are bounded entire functions, they are constant and so it follows that $v(z)$ is constant, meaning that both its partial derivatives are equal to 0 and, due to Cauchy Riemann, both of the partial derivatives of $u(z)$ are equal to zero.  It would then follow that $f(z)$ is constant. I don't know how to go about the question using the Maximum Modulus Theorem, also I feel I am overlooking the importance of $|z|=1$ perhaps? Any help would be much appreciated!!",['complex-analysis']
226793,Show that $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in the real numbers. (Using Supremum),"I am stuck on a homework the teacher gave us to hand in. It is stated as following: The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ given by all $q = \frac{m}{n}$ for some $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $n \neq 0$ is dense in the real numbers in the following sense:
  For each real $\epsilon > 0$ and $x \in \mathbb{R} \exists q_{\epsilon}: |x- q_{\epsilon}| < \epsilon$ With the problem, I am given a hint: Prove the statement first for $x > 0$ Let $\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ be the set of rational numbers, such that $a \in \mathbb{Q}_{x} \Rightarrow a \leq x$. Why is $\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ nonempty? Apply the supremum property to $\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ and prove that the supremum of $\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ is $x$ Here my attempts:
Suppose $x > 0$. Let $\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ the set of $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ s.th. $q \leq x$. (i) Show that $\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ is nonempty: $ q \leq x \Rightarrow \frac{m}{n} \leq x \Rightarrow n \geq \frac{m}{x}$. Then by the Archimedian property and the fact that $\mathbb{N}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ there exists an $n$ for which this is the case, thus $\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ is nonempty. (ii) Supremum By defintion, $\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ is a bounded set. Thus, by the supremum property, $\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ has a supremum. (iii) Show that $x = sup(\mathbb{Q}_{x})$ (I am not too certain how to show this, but I think I will get it in time, however, hints are appreciated) But from then on I am stuck. For any x > 0, I can show that there is a set of rational numbers for which x is the supremum. Thus, I can find a rational number arbitratly close to x, making $x-q < \epsilon$?
And what about $x\neq0$? How does my result help me there? Thanks for the time and advice! First, thanks for your help. However, I am still in need of some more. I find myself unable to show that if $\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ is bounded by $x$, $x$ is indeed the supremum of that set. If I suppose that there is a $y < x$ and that that $y$ is an upper bound (in order to prove by contradiction), how can I find a $q \in \mathbb{Q}_{x}$ which is larger than $y$ without using that between any two real numbers, there lies a rational number, which is what I am supposed to show in the first place?",['real-analysis']
