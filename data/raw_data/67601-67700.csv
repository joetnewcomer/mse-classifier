808835,"Uniform convergence of $f_n(x)=nx^n(1-x)$ for $x \in [0,1]$?","I want to decide whether or not $f_n(x)=nx^n(1-x)$ is uniformly convergent or not. I have shown that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x)=0$ for $x \in [0,1]$. Now $f_n(0)=f_n(1)=0$. And in $(0,1)$, we have $f'_n(x)=n^2x^{n-1}-n(n+1)x^n$. Putting this to zero gives $x=\frac{n}{n+1}$. Also $f_n(\frac{n}{n+1})=(\frac{n}{n+1})^{n+1}$. But that tends to $\frac{1}{e}$ as $n$ tends to $\infty$ which is not $0$ so we don't have uniform convergence, right? Nonetheless we have $\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_0^1 f_n(x)dx=\lim_{n\to\infty} (\frac{n}{n+2}-\frac{n}{n+1})=0=\int_0^1 \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x)dx$. Is all this right? I have some doubts, I mostly doubt my intuition in analysis... Thank you!","['functional-analysis', 'uniform-convergence', 'analysis']"
808836,A singular $n-$cube and a circumference defined the border than 2-cube,"This is an exercise from "" Calculus on Manifolds "" by Michel Spivack (first edition, p.100): If $c$ is a singular $1$-cube in $\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, with $c(0)=c(1)$, show that there is an integer $n$ such that $c-c_{i,n}=\partial c^2$ for some $2-$chain $c^2$. Definitions: A singular $n-$cube in $A\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a continous fuction $\alpha:[0,1]^k\to A$. A singular $n-$chain is a sum $\sum^k_{j=1} r_j\alpha_j$, where $\alpha_j$ is a singular $n-$cube and $r_j\in \mathbb{R}$. So, in this case, $c$ is a curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $c_{1,n}$ is a circumference with radio $1$ and a total of $n$ laps around the origin. I can consider a line that intersects the origin, and if $\{U_{+}, U_{-}\}$ is an open cover of $\mathbb{R^2}-\{0\}$, then $\{c^{-1}(U_{+}), c^{-1}(U_{-})\}$ is an open cover of $[0,1]$. I have problems to properly write the proof. Is this a correct idea? How can I end the proof?

809145,Proving that a Function is Analytic Given that it is Equal to the Complex Conjugate of an analytic Function,"So I'm working a problem that states: A function $f$ is analytic in an open set $U$. Define $g$ by $g(z)=\overline{f(\overline{z})}$ (just because the notation can be hard to read, this is the the complex conjugate of the function $f$ defined at the complex conjugate of $z$). Show that $g$ is analytic in the oopen set $U^{\star}=\{z:\overline{z}\in{U}\}$ and that $g^{\prime}(z)=\overline{f^{\prime}(\overline{z})}$ (this is the complex conjugate of the derivative of $f$ evaluated at the complex conjugate of $z$) for $z\in{U^{\star}}$ Now, my book gives the definition of an analytic function as one that is a function defined over an open set on which it is differentiable at every point of that set and that every derivative of that function satisfying the preceeding properties has derivatives that are analytic on that domain as well. So, I know that being differentiable at a point means that a function is continuous at that point, so I see straight away that this means $\forall{\epsilon}>0$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that if $|z-z_0|<\delta$ then $|f(z)-f(z_0)|<\epsilon$. Since $U$ is an open set, it follows that $U\cap{z_0}$ is non-empty. Because $f$ is analytic in $U$, I can choose two elements $z$ and $z_0$ of $U$ that satisfy $|z-z_0|=|\overline{z}-\overline{z_0}|<\delta$ and  $|f(z)-f(z_0)|<\epsilon$. Since $|\overline{z}-\overline{z_0}|<\delta$, this means that $|f(\overline{z})-f(\overline{z_0})|<\epsilon$. Observing that $|f(\overline{z})-f(\overline{z_0})|=|\overline{f(\overline{z})-f(\overline{z_0})}|$, I conclude that $\overline{f(\overline{z})}$ is continuous. This being the case, then (and I think I've done this part correct) I can compute the derivative by using the limit definition as: $g'(z)=\lim\limits_{h\rightarrow{0}}\frac{\overline{f(\overline{z}+\overline{h})}-\overline{f(\overline{z})}}{h}=\lim\limits_{\overline{h}\rightarrow{0}}\overline{({f(\overline{z}+\overline{h})-f(\overline{z})})\ \  /\ \ {\overline{h}}}$, as I know that as $h\rightarrow{0}$, so does $\overline{h}\rightarrow{0}$. Since the function $f$ is analytic for all complex numbers in $U$, its derivative there, as given above, is the complex conjugate of the limit which is $\overline{f'(\overline{z})}$. That's what I'm concerned about, however, because I haven't actually shown yet that $\overline{f(\overline{z})}$ is, in fact, analytic on its domain, all I know is that it is continuous on its domain. My thought is that it might only be analytic for the set $U$ if $U$ is a subset of the real numbers, since that is the only place that $\overline{z}$ is analytic and thus the composition $(a\circ{b})(z)$ for $b(z)=f(\overline{z})$ (analytic for $\overline{z}\in{U}$) and $a(z)=\overline{z}$, so the composition would be analytic on the set given by the intersection of the real numbers with $U$ but I don't believe that is right? I've tried considering an equivalent case given by the conjugation $\overline{g(z)}=\overline{\overline{f(\overline{z})}}=f(\overline{z})$ to no avail. Essentially, I'm asking to see if anyone can point me in the right direction and tell me if what I've done so far is on the right track. I should add that these problems are from a section in the book preceeding the discussion about the Cauchy-Riemann Equations, so while I'm not sure if they will help, I don't want to use them. I'm tagging this as homework although it's not 'homework' in the sense that I'm taking a class, but the problem is from a book, so I feel it is appropriate to tag it as such.

809208,Smooth function composed with sobolev function vanishes at 0,"Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain with sufficiently smooth boundary. Let $u \in W^{1, 2}_{0}(\Omega)$ and $F \in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R})$ such that $F(u(x)) = 0$ for almost every $x \in \Omega$. Must $F(0) = 0$? My thoughts are: I think the answer is yes. Suppose $u$ instead was smooth. The $F(u(x)) = 0$ for every $x \in \Omega$. By continuity, $F(u(x)) = 0$ for every $x \in \overline{\Omega}$.

809236,Question about twisting sheaves: Twisting by two points on $\mathbb{P}^1$ and basepoints of $\mathscr{O}(-1)$,"I was trying to do some computations to get familiar with twisting sheaves and I ran into some questions. I would greatly appreciate any help! Thanks in advance! For line bundles, being globally generated is the same as being basepoint free. The bundle $\mathscr{O}(-1)$ on $\mathbb{P}^n$ has no global sections which means that it must have a basepoint. But I am not sure how to go about finding this basepoint. Aren't the sections of $\mathscr{O}(-1)$ just degree -1 homogeneous elements of $\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}$? If so, on each open $U_{x_i}$, the sections are elements of the form $\frac{f}{x_i^n}$ where $f$ is a degree $n-1$ homogeneous element of $k[x_0,\dots,x_n]$. In this case, I don't see why all sections of $\mathscr{O}(-1)$ must vanish at the same point. (And what does it mean to be a basepoint of a line bundle that has no global sections? In Vakil's notes, a base point is defined to be where all sections vanish. To find a basepoint, does it suffice to check where all the global sections vanish?) I would like to compute the global sections of $\mathscr{O}(p+q)$ where $p=[0,1],q=[1,0]\in \mathbb{P}^1$ where $\mathbb{P}^1=$Proj$k[x,y]$. We can describe $p+q$ as the Cartier divisor $(U_x,y),(U_y,x)$ (I'm using Hartshorne's definition of a Cartier divisor). Then, the sections of the line bundle $\mathscr{O}(p+q)$ are: on $U_x$, elements of the form $\frac{1}{y}\frac{f}{x^n}$ where $f\in k[x,y]$ is homogeneous of degree $n$; on $U_y$, elements of the form $\frac{1}{x}\frac{f}{y^n}$ where $f\in k[x,y]$ is homogeneous of degree $n$. Then, global sections are $g\in k[x,y]$ such that $g=\frac{1}{x}\frac{f_1}{y^n}=\frac{1}{y}\frac{f_2}{x^n}$ for some $f_1,f_2\in k[x,y]$ degree $n$. This implies that global sections must be of the form $\frac{ax+by}{xy}$ which tells us that $h^0(\mathbb{P}^1,\mathscr{O}(p+q))=2$. I am a bit confused because I thought that by degree count, $\mathscr{O}(p+q)\cong \mathscr{O}(2)$ and so must have 3-dimensional global sections. Similarly I tried to compute $\mathscr{O}(p)$ where $p=[1,0]$ by describing $p$ as the Cartier divisor $(U_x,y),(U_y,y)$. This just gave me the trivial line bundle. I think the way I am describing/corresponding divisors to Cartier divisors might be incorrect but I haven't been able to figure out how.",['algebraic-geometry']

I have seen tons of pullbacks in differential geometry but we didn't care much about functors then. Now I'm doing algebraic geometry and we need presheaves all the time, and if $\mathcal F$ is a presheaf over a topological space $X$ and $f : X \to Y$ a continuous map, we can pushforward $\mathcal F$ to the presheaf $f_* \mathcal{F} \overset{def}= \mathcal F \circ f^{-1}$ where $f^{-1}$ is seen as a functor $f^{-1} : \mathcal T(Y) \to \mathcal T(X)$. To try to see this one as a pullback, I started with the commutative square of the pullback of $Y$ by $f$ over $X$, so I have a square with $f^{-1}(X)$, $X$ on top and two $Y$'s on the bottom. Then I apply the ""topology functor"" (which maps $X$ to its topology, seen as a category because it is a preorder) and I get another diagram, which is now a pushout ; I add an arrow on top of $\mathcal T(X)$ (which is $\mathcal F$) and I take the pushout of this diagram, which gives me... not much.

But ever since solving it for myself in 1969, after several months of futile struggling with the analogous problem where vertex P is 40 degrees instead of 20, I have been wondering about the following extension: Find all sets of three distinct angles APB, ABM and BAN, all rational multiples of $\pi$, such that angle ANM (and hence all the other angles in the diagram) is also a rational multiple of $\pi$.  This may be too hard -- then find any other such set of angles. [Change after Josh B's comment -- any other such set of angles with the vertex not 20 degees.

How do i prove that the stabilizer of $z$ is equal to 3 without drawing a picture?

Let $x,y,z \in \mathbb{R}$ with $x \equiv y$ and $y \equiv z$. We now show that $x \equiv z$: Since $x^2=y^2$ and $y^2=z^2$ we get by transitivity of equality $x^2=z^2$ and therefore $x \equiv z.$ Is the answer to the question correct?

809470,Fractals - when the number of seed shapes that can fit into the scaled-up copy is non-integer.,"I've heard people say (for eg. here ) that the dimension of fractal patterns (particularly, in this question, Lindenmayer fractals ) can be formulated as follows: $$D=\frac{\ln N}{\ln S}$$ Where $N$ is the number of copies of the seed shape that fit into a copy scaled by the scaling factor $S$. The logic is simple and works for simple shapes of integer dimension.  Take a line of length $1$ and scale it by $S=2$, and you can fit 2 original lines in the scaled up copy, giving $N=2$ and thus $D=1$, as you would expect.  Take a unit square and scale it by $S=2$ and you get $N=4$ and thus $D=2$.  Do same process for cube and you get $D=3$. This logic is then extended, inductively, to patterns with non-integer dimension like the Cantor Dust, the Sierpinski gasket, the Sierpinski carpet. The seed shape of the Sierpinski gasket for example is: Scale it up by $S=2$ and you get: You can easily see that 3 seed shapes fit into the scaled up copy.  Thus, $$D=\frac{\ln(3)}{\ln(2)}$$ as is well known. Now my question: What about seed shapes which do not fit neatly into scaled up copies?  For example, what if I add a little triangle in the center of the Sierpinski gasket seed shape... And then scale up by $S=2$ again: How many seed shapes fit into this scaled up copy?  Clearly, three whole seed shapes fit, but there is also a residual triangle in the center of the copy.  So $N=3+r$ and
$$D=\frac{\ln(3+r)}{\ln(2)}$$ where $r$ is ""some residual"" of the seed shape.  How to calculate $r$?  This raises other questions like what exactly constitutes a ""copy.""  What does it mean to talk about a fraction of a copy, etc.? The logic of the first equation in this post is fun and intriguing but it is (I think) purely inductive.  There is no theorem proving it.

The statement does not hold if we have an infinite set of tile types.  For example, we could take arbitrarily large squares that are missing small notches on the side.  Any region can be covered with a large enough square, but we have no way to fill in the missing notch. For context, I'm trying to understand non-periodic tilings, and I'm not sure how one could generically show that a given collection of tiles non-periodically tiles the plane unless a criterion similar to this one is true.","['geometry', 'tiling']"
809581,$x^p-x+a$ irreducible for nonzero $a\in K$ a field of characteristic $p$ prime,"Is it true that $f(x)=x^p-x+a\in K[x]$ is irreducible for nonzero $a\in K$ a field of characteristic $p$ prime? I've seen variants of this question around, but they don't seem to answer the question as worded.  (It's possible I have not searched well enough or misunderstood the techniques already given) I almost understand the case for finite fields: If $p=2$,  then to show irreducibility we need only show that it has no roots. For $p>2$, I can show that it's separable since the formal derivative is $-1$. Separability also follows from $f(\alpha)=0\Rightarrow f(\alpha+1)=0$.  This also shows that if $\alpha$ were a root in $\mathbb{F}_p$ then $0$ would be a root, a contradiction since we assumed $a\neq 0$; hence the polynomial has no roots in the prime subfield of $K$.  [...] But then?  Arguments I have seen seem to use the additional fact that $f(x)\in \mathbb{F}_p$. I imagine it will come down to some kind of argument with coefficients (depending on roots, maybe using elementary symmetric polynomials) but other nifty ways I'm not seeing also appreciated.","['ring-theory', 'irreducible-polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'positive-characteristic']"

As time goes by the potential slice increases monotonely from nothing until it becomes the entire cake"" ( Dubins & Spanier, ""How to cut a cake fairly"", 1961 ). Define $C$ as the entire cake and define $K_C(t)$ as the subset of $C$ that has already been covered by the knife at time $t$. This function has the following properties: It is a monotonically increasing function of $t$. $K_C(0)=\phi$ and $K_C(T)=C$ (where $T$ is a finite positive number). The Lebesgue measure $L(K_C(t))$ is a continuous increasing function of $t$. For every non-atomic measure $M$ on $C$, the function $M(K_C(t))$ is a continuous non-decreasing function of $t$. My questions are: Is there a formal term for a function $K_C(t)$ having all these properties? Does such a function exist for every ""cake"" (set) $C$? If not, under what conditions it is possible to define a function $K_C(t)$ over a set given $C$? Is property 4 required in the definition of $K_C(t)$, or can it be inferred from the previous properties?

I've found that the poles of the function are at $i$ and $-i$ since $\cos{z}$ is holomorphic everywhere, and so I used partial fractions to split the integrand as follows: $$\frac{\cos{z}}{z^2 + 1} = \frac{\frac{i}{2} \cos{z}}{z + i} - \frac{\frac{i}{2} \cos{z}}{z - i}$$ And then I integrated each separately, using Cauchy's integral theorem, which I argued is applicable since each integrand is now of the form $f(z) / (z - z_0)$ with $z_0 = \pm i$, with each pole (and the contour) being inside the parallelogram and $f$ holomorphic everywhere. Using the theorem I found that both integrals were equal to $\pi \cosh{1}$. So the two cancel out and I concluded that: $$\int_{\gamma} \frac{\cos{z}}{z^2 + 1} dz = 0$$ Is this correct? Also, is there some kind of easy way to check if a contour integral result makes sense, perhaps some intuitive interpretation of them, or a systematic way to reduce them to a real-valued integral that could be fed to a computer?

The paper says: Take now two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $u(x_1)=0$ and $u(x_2)=1$ and connect them by the shortest geodesic $\gamma(t)$ with $|\dot\gamma(t)|=1$. Then, integrating over $\gamma$, we have

\int_0^1\frac{du}{\sqrt{2-u^2}} & \leq \int_{\gamma}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2-u^2}}|\frac{du}{dt}|dt\\
& \leq \int_{\gamma}\sqrt{\lambda}dt\\
& \leq \sqrt{\lambda}d.

Could someone please, explain me the reason why are those the limits of integration? I think my doubt is because I'm confuse about the definition of ""integration over a curve"". My attempt was the following: I think that we should take a parametrization of $\gamma:[0,l]\to M$ and then take the composition $\varphi(t):=\arcsin(\frac{u(\gamma(t))}{\sqrt 2})$. We would get \begin{align}
|\dot \varphi(t)| & =\Big|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2-u(\gamma(t))^2}}\Big\langle\nabla u_{\gamma(t)},\dot\gamma\rangle\Big|\\
& \leq \frac{|\nabla u_{\gamma(t)}|}{\sqrt{2-u(\gamma(t))^2}}

|\varphi(l)-\varphi(0)| & =|\int_0^l\dot \varphi(s)ds|\\
& \leq \int_0^l |\dot \varphi(s)|ds\\

810171,Direction of gradient from level surface?,"In the diagram below, we see a level surface with a gradient. As a consequence of the multivariable chain rule, the gradient is normal to the surface. That's clear to me. Why is the gradient pointing outward rather than into the sphere? I understand that if it were, it would be a negative gradient, but that's a consequence, not an explanation. Why does the gradient have to point away from a level set rather than into it?","['multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives']"
810173,local invertibility does not imply global invertibility,"What is an example of a smooth function with continuous derivatives, that is  locally invertible but not globally, and the reason for that is not injectivity. My first idea was $f:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to \mathbb{R}^{2}$ defined by $f(x,y)=(e^{x}\cos y, e^{x}\sin y)$ everything above is satisfied except that the function is injective... What example one can take? Thanks","['multivariable-calculus', 'inverse', 'calculus']"
810200,Deducing correct answers from multiple choice exams,"I am looking for an algorithmic way to solve the following problem. Problem Say we are given a multiple choice test with 100 questions, 4 answers per question (exactly one of those four being correct), each correctly given answer is worth one point, wrong answers are worth zero points.
If now we got a database D of lots of answer sheets and their corresponding points, e.g. D:= { ('ABAA...', 80), 
  ('ABAB...', 80),
  ('ABAC...', 80),
  ('ABAD...', 81), ... } How can we find out which answers are correct?
I am not looking for something probabilistic, but for answers which are definitely correct. Some ideas There are some obvious strategies like: look for someone who reached 100 points; you got all your answers look for tests, whose answers differ only by one (in the example database given, we can deduce the answer to question 4 is ""D"") look for someone who answered everything wrong, you can rule out those answers But what information can we get from other combinations of answers? Viewing the answer sheets as a metric space we get 100 - S(test) = d(test, correct) for the hamming distance d(.,.) , the score S(.) and the correct sheet correct . Maybe someone could give me a reformulation of the problem, which yields a more obvious implementation. Any contribution is appreciated. Edit: Not considering computational complexity, couldn't I achieve something by intersecting the balls 
$$
\bigcap_i B_{d(t_i,\textrm{correct})}(t_i),
$$
with tests $t_i$ and balls $B_d(x) := \{y: d(x,y)\leq d\}$?","['puzzle', 'coding-theory', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics']"
