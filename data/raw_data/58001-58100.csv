636488,Does $\lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{C_{R}} e^{iz} \ dz = 0$?,"Let $C_{R}$ be the upper half of the circle $|z|= R$. Does $$ \lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{C_{R}} e^{iz} \ dz = 0 ?$$ I don't know if you can conclude from Jordan's lemma that it doesn't vanish.  And the estimation lemma would appear to be inconclusive here. But along the circle $|z|=R$, $ \displaystyle |e^{iz}| = e^{-R \sin t}$. So as $R \to \infty$, the integrand decays exponentially. Is that enough to conclude the integral vanishes? And what about $ \displaystyle\lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{C_{R}} z  e^{iz} \ dz$? EDIT : What's preventing both integrals from vanishing is the size of $|e^{iz}|$ near the endpoints of the contour. If you were to integrate along only a portion of the contour that stays away from the endpoints, the estimation lemma would show that both integrals do vanish.","['complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

636517,Is it true that the whole space is the direct sum of a subspace and its orthogonal space?,"Problem The ground field is $K$, $\operatorname{char}K\neq2$. Suppose $W$ is a (maybe infinite dimensional) subspace of a vector space $V$ with a symmetric/symplectic form $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$. The orthogonal space of $W$, denoted as $W^\perp$, is defined as $W^\perp=\{\,v\in V\,\colon\,\langle v,w\rangle=0,\forall w\in W\,\}$. If the form is nondegenerate on $W$, say $W\cap W^\perp=\{0\}$, is it true that $V=W\oplus W^\perp$? What if the form is nondegenerate on $V$? Background The statement is true when $W$ is finite dimensional. One can choose an orthogonal basis for $W$, then apply the projection formula to determine a orthogonal projection. However, such a process couldn't be applied in the infinite dimensional case. I'm interested in how far we can generalize our results of psuedo-Euclidean or symplectic forms on a finite dimensional vector space to the infinite-dimensional case.","['geometry', 'quadratic-forms', 'bilinear-form', 'linear-algebra', 'symplectic-linear-algebra']"

636600,Equivalent Definition of Continuity,"I am trying to understand a proof in a book. (Willard, General Topology, p. 45) Theorem : Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and $f : X \to Y$. If for each $E \subseteq X$, $f(\operatorname{Cl}_X(E)) \subseteq \operatorname{Cl}_Y f(E)$, then $f$ is continuous on $X$. Proof : Let $x \in X$ and let $V$ be an open neighborhood of $f(x)$. Set $E = X - f^{-1}(V)$ and let $U = X - \operatorname{Cl}_X E$. It is easy to verify that, since $f(\operatorname{Cl}_X E) \subseteq \operatorname{Cl}_Y f(E)$, we have $x \in U$. It is even clearer that $f(U) \subseteq V$. Hence $f$ is continuous at $x$. I have not been able to show that $x \in U$ and $f(U) \subseteq V$. Scratch Work :
For the first part, if I suppose by way of contradiction that $x \notin U$, then $x \in \operatorname{Cl}_X E$ and by hypothesis $f(x) \in \operatorname{Cl}_Y f(E) = \bigcap\{K$ closed in $Y : f(E) \subseteq K\}$. But $f(E) \subseteq Y - V$ which is closed. So $f(x) \in Y - V$ which means $x \notin f^{-1}(V)$ which means $x \in E$. But then $x \notin f^{-1}(V)$, a contradiction since $f(x) \in V$. Is this correct? I am unable to get anywhere with the second part ($f(U) \subseteq V$.","['general-topology', 'continuity']"

636832,Proof of a special case of Fermat's Last Theorem.,"Here, I will try to prove a special case of Fermat's Last Theorem, namely when $a=b$ in this definition: Fermat's Last Theorem In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation $a^n + b^n = c^n$ for any integer value of $n$ greater than two. Here's the proof: Let's suppose the equation $x^n+x^n=y^n$ have one or more solutions where $n$ is an integer grater than $2$ and $x$ and $y$ are also integers. This means that $2x^n=y^n$, thus $\sqrt[n]{2}x=y$. But this is a contradiction since $\sqrt[n]{2}$ is irrational for every $n$ in $\Bbb N$, which implies that $y$ is irrational contradicting our second assumption. Therefore, the equation $x^n+x^n=y^n$ has no solution in $\Bbb N$. Do you think it is right? Thank you.",['number-theory']

636844,Verifying continuity of the deformation retraction of the mapping cylinder,"Given $f : X \rightarrow Y$ I have the mapping cylinder $M_f = (X \times I) \sqcup Y / \sim$ where $I = [0,1]$ and $(x,0)_1$ is glued to $f(x)_2$ (I'd like to be pedantic for this verification so I'm adding subscripts resulting from the disjoint union). It is usually said that the mapping cylinder deformation retracts to the subspace $Y$; again being pedantic what must be meant is that $M_f$ deformation retracts to the subspace consisting of the points $\{y_2\}$ for $y \in Y-f(X)$ and $\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\}$ for $x \in X$, I'll call this subspace $C = \{\{y_2\}, \{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\} \: | \: y \in Y - f(X), x \in X\}$. My first question is that do we not have to be pedantic here because I assume that we could only loosely say $Y$ instead of this subspace if these two spaces were homeomorphic and for the obvious map between them to be a homeomoprhism in general we would require that $f$ be an injection? Secondly, I'd like to verify that the expected deformation retraction is indeed one. $M_f$ consists of three types of points, $\{y_2\}$'s, $\{(x,s)_1\}$'s and $\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\}$'s; and the relevant map $M_f \times I \rightarrow M_f$ is $$\left(\{y_2\}, t\right) \mapsto \{y_2\} \:\:\: \forall y \in Y - f(X), t \in I,$$ $$\left(\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\},t\right) \mapsto \{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\} \:\:\: \forall x \in X, t \in I,$$ $$\left(\{(x,s)_1\},t\right) \mapsto \{(x,(1-t)s)_1\} \:\:\: \forall x \in X, s \in (0,1], t \in [0,1),$$ $$\left(\{(x,s)_1\},1\right) \mapsto \{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\} \:\:\: \forall x \in X, s \in (0,1].$$ That the map $M_f \rightarrow M_f$ retrieved by setting $t = 0$ is the identity map is clear, and so is that the map retrieved by setting $t = 1$ maps all of $M_f$ onto $C$ and finally that each map for a fixed $t$ restricted to $C$ is the identity map. The only concern is continuity. I was able to show that each map for a fixed $t$ is continuous (in a manner similar to how I attempted this problem), but not this map from $M_f \times I \rightarrow M_f$ that we have here. My attempt is as follows: Let $U$ be any open subset of $M_f$; $U$ consists of points $\{y_2\}$ for $y$ in some $B \subseteq Y$, of points $\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\}$ for $x$ in some $A \subseteq X$ and of points $\{(x,s)_1\}$ for $(x,s)$ in some $Q \subseteq X \times (0,1]$. Using the definitions of the quotient and disjoint union topologies this tells us that $B \cup f(A)$ is open in $Y$ and that $A \times \{0\} \cup Q$ is open in $X \times I$. The preimage of $U$ under our map above is the union of the following $$\{\{y_2\} \: | \: y \in B\} \times I,$$ (where the $\{y_2\}$'s come from) $$\{\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\} \: | \: x \in A\} \times I,$$ $$\{\{(x,s)_1\} \: | \: x \in A, s \in (0,1]\} \times \{1\},$$ (where the $\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\}$'s come from), and $$\{(\{(x,s)_1\},t) \: | \: (x,s,t) \in \varphi^{-1}[Q]\}$$ (where the $\{(x,s)_1\}$'s come from) where $\varphi : X \times (0,1] \times [0,1) \rightarrow X \times I : (x,s,t) \mapsto (x,(1-t)s)$. In the cases of the maps for each fixed $t$, the preimages worked out to be similar but simpler and openness wasn't too difficult to establish. Here all I have been able to say is that because $A \times \{0\} \cup Q$ is open in $X \times I$, its preimage under $\varphi$, which is in fact just $\varphi^{-1}[Q]$ because the second coordinate of any image point cannot be zero, is open in $X \times (0,1] \times [0,1)$ and as a result in $X \times [0,1] \times [0,1]$, this then implies that our final set $\{(\{(x,s)_1\},t) \: | \: (x,s,t) \in \varphi^{-1}[Q]\}$ is open in $M_f \times I$. From here however I haven't been able to get further. I've tried picking points in one of the four sets and then trying to combine subsets of the four sets in various ways to find an open set containing the point within our four sets and I've noted some small things like the first two of our four sets may be considered together in the form $E \cup I$ with $E \subseteq M_f$ and the pullback across the quotient projection map and then the disjoint union inclusion map of $E$ gives $B \cup f(A)$ in $Y$ which is known to be open but we get $A \times \{0\}$ in $X \times I$. I decided to do this verification, and in this pedantic a manner, for practice. I'd very much like to move on but it's bugging me and I'd really appreciate some help.","['general-topology', 'continuity', 'algebraic-topology']"

Y = R * Math.cos(lat) * Math.sin(lon); So I obtained: A: (4599,392641683213, 1279,6610297820203)
B: (4599,334350798723, 1279,574411410788) NOTE: It assumes that the altitude is negligible in A and B. Now that I have the cartesian coordinates I can calculate the distance using Pitagora's theorem, so: |Xb - Xa| = 4599,392641683213 - 4599,334350798723 = 0,05829 Km
|Yb - Ya| = 1279,6610297820203 - 1279,574411410788 = 0,08662 Km

distanceAB = sqrt(0,05829^2 + 0,08662^2) = 0,1044 Km = 104,4 m As you can see the distance calculated with the above methods generate different values: 137,7 m for with the former, 104,4 m with the latter.

This limit arises naturally if you want to take the derivative of $a^x$ : $$ \frac{a^{x+\epsilon} - a^x }{\epsilon} = a^x \frac{a^\epsilon - 1}{\epsilon} $$ I would like to know the next-order term or factor here.

636998,Can the sigmoid function approximate any function (or relation) where $0<y<1$,"I'm studying Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks. Some basic principles of Machine Learning are linear regression, multivariate linear regression, and nonlinear regression. The last of these, nonlinear regression, involves fitting a curve to a set of data. This curve can be any shape (it might fail the vertical and horizontal line test). In the tutorial I am following, Stanford Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, he says that the sigmoid function is used for non linear regression, and the more polynomial terms used the more complex the curve can be. I'll give an example: $$y=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\left(100x^2-100y\right)}}$$ approximates the polynomial: $$y=x^2$$ The sigmoid function can also approximate curves that are relations instead of functions. For example: $$y=\space \frac{1}{1+e^{-\left(5+1x\space -3y\space +4xy\space -1yx^2\space -2yx^3-1xy^2\space +30y^3\right)}}$$ But if I use enough polynomial terms can this function approximate any function or relation?

637009,Tricky weak-* convergence question,"Let $K$ be a compact (let's say, $K=[0,1]$ to be concrete) and let $\mu_n$ be a sequence of Radon measures converging weakly-* to another Radon measure $\mu$ on $K$. Let $h : K \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function vanishing only a finite set, and assume that 
$\mu_n/h$ and $\mu/h$ are all well-defined Radon measures (ie $1/h$ is integrable for all those measures). Is it true that $\mu_n/h$ converges weakly-* to $\mu/h$ ? It should be noted that in general for a non-continuous function $g$, weak-* convergence of $\mu_n$ to $\mu$ does not imply weak-* convergence of $g \mu_n$ to $g \mu$ when those measures are well-defined : it's easy to construct counter examples with diracs and functions vanishin everywhere but on a finite set. However I think in my setting it should be true, intuitively because the $\mu_n$ and $\mu$ could not charge the zeroes of $h$ too much, and because elsewhere $1/h$ is continuous. My idea for proving this was to take a continuous function $f$ and try to verify convergence of $\int f/h d\mu_n$ to $\int f/h d\mu$ by truncating $1/h$ near its singularities. 
However I lack uniformity in $n$ to gain the convergence. Any help appreciated.","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

Consider now an arbitrary compact sub-interval of $I$, i.e., $\displaystyle [a,b] \subset I$ .

If I let $f=$ the event that the diamond is fake while $r=$ the event that the diamond is real, $rffr$ The first is real, the next two is fake and the second real shows up. $frffr$ The first is fake, the next is real, two fake shows and the second real shows up. ... $f...frffr$ The first 23 fake shows, a real shows, the rest of the two fake shows and the last one is inevitably real.

637341,Correct substitution for simplifying derivative,"The stationary points of $$
f(x,y) = (x^2 + y^2)e^{-(x^2 + y^2)}
$$ can be seen to be at $(0,0)$ and on the unit circle, specifically the point at $(0,0)$ is a local minimum and points on the unit circle maximums. This is easy to verify by partial differentiation. I tried another approach via the substitution $r = x^2 + y^2$, which gives a simpler differential with respect to $r$, $$
\frac{d}{dr} (re^{-r}) = (1 - r)e^{-r}
$$ which clearly gives the stationary points on the unit circle. However, this differential implies the point $r = 0$ has derivative $1$, not $0$ as expected. If instead the substitution $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$ is made, we find the derivative with respect to $r$ is $$
\frac{d}{dr} (r^2e^{-r^2}) = e^{-r^2} (2r-2 r^3)
$$ which has roots $r = \pm 1$ and $r = 0$, giving all the stationary points expected. My question is why does the second substitution give all the correct stationary points where as the first does not? And why does the first substitution imply the point $(0,0)$ has a non-zero derivative?","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'partial-derivative']"

637363,The set of all the partial ordering of $X$ is a partially ordered set.,"I have trouble with the following exercise. I don't understand it. Also I think that $x,y\in P$ should be $x,y\in X$. Could someone give an insight of the exercise and also some hint of how to solve the third part, please? Thanks Let $X$ be a set and let $P$ be the set of all the partial ordering of $X$. We say that one partial ordering $\le \in P$ is a coarser than another partial ordering $\le' \in P$ if for any $x,y\in P$ we have the implication $x\le y \Rightarrow x\le' y$. Let us write $\le \preceq\le' $ if $\le$ is a coarser than $\le ' $. (1) Show that $\preceq$ turns $P$ into a partially ordered set. We will show that is partial ordered relation. Clearly if $x\le y \rightarrow x\le y$, i.e., $\le \preceq \le$ which shows that is a reflexive relation. For anti-symmetric relation, suppose that   $x\le y \rightarrow x\le' y$ and $x\le' y \rightarrow x\le y$, then we have $x\le y  \leftrightarrow x\le' y$ for all $x,y$. Thus $\le = \le'$ since otherwise the logical equivalence doesn't hold. To conclude we have to show that $\preceq$ is a transitive relation. Suppose that  $x\le y \rightarrow x\le' y$ and $x\le' y \rightarrow x\le'' y$, thus $x\le y\rightarrow  x\le'' y $ which means that  if $\le \preceq \le'$ and $\le' \preceq \le''$, so $\le \preceq \le''$, since $x,y$ are given. (2) There is exactly one minimal element of $P$, what is it? But I'm not sure of what the minimal element should be I thought it would be the empty relation but since $X$ is not assume to be empty, then the empty relation cannot be reflexive and in particular is not a partial ordering on $X$, i.e., $\le_\varnothing \notin P$ (3) Show that the maximal ordering of $P$ are precisely the total ordering. Using Zorn's lemma show that given any partial ordering $\le$ of $X$ there exists a total ordering $\le'$ such that $\le$ is coarser than $\le'$ We have to show that the set $P$ is non-empty. If $X= \varnothing$ then $\le_\varnothing \in P$ where $\le_\varnothing $ denote the empty relation. In case that $X\not= \varnothing$, then it contains some $x\in X$ and so we can define that $\forall y,z\in X$ we have $y\le_X z \iff (y\not= x \text{ and } y =z) \text{ or } z = x$. The relation defined above is a partial ordering of $X$. Since is reflexive $y\le_X y$. If $y\le_X z$ and $z\le_X y$ then we have either $z=x$ or $y\not= x$ and $y=z$, If $z=x$, then $z\le_X y$ implies that $y=x$ and so $y=x=z$, in the case that $y\not=x$ and $y=z$ we're done. Now if $y\le_X z$ and $z\le_X w$, we have if $z=x$ so $w=z=x$ and clearly $z\le_X w$, otherwise $y\not= x$ and $y=z$, so $z\not= x$ and $z=w$, i.e., $x\le_X w$. Hence $\le_X \in P$ In either case $P\not= \varnothing$. Now let $\mathcal{C}$ be a totally ordered subset of $P$ we have to show that there is an upper bound. Let $\le_\mathcal{C}$ be defined as follows, we say that for $x,y\in X, \;x\le_\mathcal{C} y \iff  \exists \le'\in \mathcal{C}$ such that $x\le' y $. We have to show $\le_\mathcal{C} $ is well-defined. Suppose $\le, \le' \in \mathcal{C}$ and there exists $x,y \in X$ such that $x\le y$ and $y\le' x$ but $y\not= x$. Since both are in $\mathcal{C}$ either $\le \preceq \le'$ or $\le' \preceq \le$. Without loss of generality suppose that $\le \preceq \le'$, then $x\le y$ implies $x\le' y$ and since $x\not= y$ so $x<' y$ which contradicts our assumption that $y<' x$. Hence $\le_\mathcal{C} $  is well-defined. Also is not difficult to show that is a partial ordering of $X$. Clearly $\le_\mathcal{C}$ is an upper bound for $\mathcal{C}$ because whenever $x\le' y$ for $\le' \in \mathcal{C}$ would imply $x\le_\mathcal{C} y$, which means $\le' \preceq \le_\mathcal{C}$. Thus by Zorn's lemma  $X$ contains at least one maximal element which we call $\le_P$. We claim that $\le_P$ is a total ordering of $X$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that  $\le_P$ is not a total ordering of $X$. Thus there must be a pair $x,y\in X$ for which neither $x\not\le_p y$ nor $y\not\le_p x$. Thus we can define $\le = \le_p$ for all $X\backslash \{x,y\}$ and we set $x\le y$. Thus is a partial ordering of  $X$, i.e., $\le \in P$ and also $\le_p \preceq \le$, note that the implication $x\le_p y \rightarrow x\le y$ is vacuously true, which is a contradiction. Hence $\le_p$ is a total ordering of $X$. Am I right? Other question: What would be the minimum element of $P$?","['self-learning', 'elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory']"

    is a semi ring. The first thing I have to show is that $\emptyset\in\mathfrak{Z}$. To show this just take any $S\in\mathcal{E}(T)$ and choose $A_t=\emptyset$ for a $t\in S$. The second thing I have to show is, that for $x,y\in\mathfrak{Z}$ it is $x\cap y\in\mathfrak{Z}$. I think, that's easy, too: Assume that $x,y\in\mathfrak{Z}$. Then there is a $S_1\in\mathcal{E}(T)$ so that $x\in \mathfrak{K}_{S_1}$ and a $S_2\in\mathfrak{E}(T)$ so that $y\in \mathfrak{K}_{S_2}$. Then $S_1\cup S_2\in\mathcal{E}(T)$ and $x\cap y\in\mathfrak{K}_{S_1\cup S_2}\in\mathfrak{Z}$. The last thing to show is the most difficult one for me.

$$
y\setminus x=\biguplus_{k=1}^{n} c_k.

Do not really know how to show that. My first idea is: If $x,y\in\mathfrak{Z},x\subset y$, then there is a $S\in\mathcal{E}(T): x,y\in\mathfrak{K}_S$. Let $y$ be $y=\times_{t\in T}A_t$ with $A_t\in\mathcal{A}_t$ for $t\in S$ and $A_t=\Omega_t$ for $t\in T\setminus S$ and $x$ be $x=\times_{t\in T}B_t$ with $B_t\in\mathcal{A}_t$ if $t\in S$ and $B_t=\Omega_t$ if $t\in T\setminus S$. Then to my understanding it is
$$
y\setminus x=\times_{t\in T}C_t, C_t=B_t\setminus A_t, t\in S; C_t=\Omega_t, t\in T\setminus S.
$$ But now I do not know how to write this as a disjoint union of sets $c_1,\ldots c_n$.

637449,How to construct three mutually orthogonal circles in stereographic projection?,"I'm new to spherical geometry and I enjoy doing ruler-and-compass constructions, so I'm trying to teach myself to do them in stereographic projection. I'm finding it challenging, to put it mildly. The following picture shows three mutually orthogonal great circles projected onto the plane (On the sphere it would look like this .): The grey circle with the shading is the intersection of the sphere with the plane. The two purple circles are orthogonal and divide the sphere into four equal biangles (segments -- like so ). The dotted circle is what I want but I made it by eye and can't figure out how to construct it properly. It's orthogonal to both purple circles, as the green tangent lines show (sort of -- I'm aware it's not terribly accurate). So I have two questions: How can I construct the dotted circle with ruler and compass? If the answer is, in fact, staring me in the face then a gentle hint would do! Is there a good source, online or in a book, of practical instructions / guidance for doing this kind of thing by hand? Any pointers would be very gratefully accepted. [EDIT: Late last night it occurred to me that I had everything I needed to solve the problem except the following technique: given an arbitrary point in the plane, construct the projection of the great circle of which that point is a ""centre"" (i.e., the equator for which the given point is the North or South pole). This would enable me to bisect (on the sphere!) one of the circle arcs that the required circle must cross; by symmetry it must clearly cross there (halfway), so this constructs a point on the circle. Then either do this three times and construct the circle on these three points or, more elegantly, construct the tangent to the purple circle at that point and the centre of the required circle will be where the tangent crosses the line pointed out by Will Jagy.] OK, thanks to both Will Jagy and Willemien for coming up with solutions to this. I'm illustrating both for clarity here. They are closely-related but different. Although my intuition isn't all the way there yet, I'm convinced that these are both correct constructions. Certainly GeoGebra measures the circles to be identical, orthogonal to the two given circles and to cross the primitive at diametrically-opposed points.

But, the prof made it very clear that this is not the case, and that we will learn how to deal with ""nasty"" integrals like this in future courses on real analysis. I have been trying to find a fairly simple explanation that a first year undergrad like myself would actually understand, but no luck this far.

(The last sentence is lifted verbatim from Gowers' post.)  We want to show that $|G| = |O_x||S_x|$.  Now, $S_x$ is (obviously) a subgroup of $G$, and the formula to be proved is just Lagrange's theorem applied to this subgroup.  This is because two elements of $G$ send $x$ to the same element of $O_x$ if and only if they belong to the same coset of $S_x$, and therefore $|O_x| = [G:S_x]$.  More formally, the map $gS_x \mapsto gx$ is injective, because $$gx = hx \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; h^{-1}gx = x \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; h^{-1}g \in S_x \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; gS_x = hS_x,$$ or, taking the contrapositive, $$gS_x \neq hS_x  \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; gx \neq hx.$$ It is also surjective, since every $gx \in O_x$ is the image of $gS_x$ under this map. It's a bit painful to see how much writing it takes to spell out a perception that in my mind is literally instantaneous.  Even so, the reasoning above, as belabored as it is, is, IMO, more succinct and straightforward than Gowers'. Am I missing something?",['group-theory']

637779,Uniform Convergence verification for Sequence of functions - NBHM,"Following is a list of problems from an exam for admission into Ph.D program. I have just compiled all previous questions on uniform convergence of sequence of functions and i tried to work out . I would be thankful if some one can check the solutions and please suggest if there are any better ways to do and if the solution is wrong please let me know what could be done for them. $f_n(x)=\sin^n x$ on $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$ $f_n(x) = \frac{x^n}{n}+1$ on $[0,1)$ $f_n(x) = \dfrac{1}{1+(x-n)^2}$ on $(-∞,0)$ $f_n(x) = \dfrac{1}{1+(x-n)^2}$ on $(0, ∞)$ $f_n(x) = nxe^{−nx}$ on $(0,∞)$ $f_n(x) = x^n$ on $[0, 1]$ $f_n(x) = \dfrac{\sin(nx)}{\sqrt{n}}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ $f_n(x)=\dfrac{nx}{1 + nx}$ on $(0,1)$ $f_n(x) = \dfrac{x^n}{1 + x^n}$ ; on  $[0, 2]$ $f_n(x)=n^2x^2e^{-nx}$ over $(0,\infty)$ $f_n(x)=(\cos (\pi n!x))^{2n}$ on $[0,1]$ $f_n(x)=n^2x(1-x^2)^n$ on $[0,1]$ I would like to explain what all i have tried and if there is any better way to do please let Me know. For $f_n(x)=\sin^n x$ on $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$ we do as follows : for $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$ we have $f_n(x)=1$ and for $x\in [0,\frac{\pi}{2})$ we have $f_n(x)=(a)^n$ where $0\leq a <1$ so, $f_n(x) \rightarrow 0$ for each  $x\in [0,\frac{\pi}{2})$ so limit function is : $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & x \in [0,\frac{\pi}{2}) \\ 1, & x=\frac{\pi}{2}. \end{cases}$$ so the limit function is not continuous so convergence is not uniform. For $f_n(x) = \frac{x^n}{n}+1$ on $[0,1)$ limit function is $f(x)=1$ . Now $|f_n(x)-f(x)|=\frac{x^n}{n}$ let $d_n =\sup \{ |f_n(x)-f(x)| : x\in [0,1) \}==\sup \{ \frac{x^n}{n} : x\in [0,1) \}$ I could see that $d_n\rightarrow 0$ intuitively but could not produce a complete proof.please help me with that.keeping that gap aside, as $d_n\rightarrow 0$ we see that convergence is uniform For $f_n(x) = \dfrac{1}{1+(x-n)^2}$ on $(-∞,0)$ we see that the limit function is $f\equiv 0$ I do not see any problem that stops this from being uniform convergence (please see below solution for what i mean when i say problem) at the same time i can not say that it is uniform convergent for sure. For $f_n(x) = \dfrac{1}{1+(x-n)^2}$ on $(0, ∞)$ we have limit function to be $f(x)\equiv 0$ 
but then, $|f_n(x)-f(x)|=|f_n(x)|$ equals  $1$ at $x=n$ so the condition $$|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon  \textbf { for all } x\in (0,\infty)$$ does not hold so the convergence is not uniform. For $f_n(x) = nxe^{−nx}$ on $(0,∞)$ we have $f_n(x)=\frac{nx}{e^{nx}}$. But $e^{nx}$ diverges faster that $nx$ so limit function is $f\equiv 0$. But then at $x=\frac{1}{n}$ we have $f_n(x)=\frac{1}{e}$ so I can not say that $|f_n(x)-f(x)|< \epsilon $ for all $x$ and for all $n\geq N$ for some $N$ if my epsilon is less than $\frac{1}{e}$ thus the convergence is Not uniform. For $f_n(x) = x^n$ on $[0, 1]$  we see that limit function is 
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & x \in [0,1) \\ 1, & x=1. \end{cases}$$
so the limit function is not continuous so convergence is not uniform. For $f_n(x) = \dfrac{\sin(nx)}{\sqrt{n}}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ we see that the limit function is $f\equiv 0$.
$|f_n(x)-f(x)|=|f_n(x)|=|\dfrac{\sin(nx)}{\sqrt{n}}|\leq\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$. Now, for given  $\epsilon>0$ if i choose $N$ such that $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}<\epsilon$ then we have $|f_n(x)-f(x)|\leq\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}<\epsilon$ for all $n\geq N$ irrespective of choice of $x$. thus the convergence is uniform. For $f_n(x)=\dfrac{nx}{1 + nx}$ on $(0,1)$ we have $f_n(x)=\dfrac{1}{\frac{1}{nx}+1}$ the limit function is $1$. Now $|f_n(x)-f(x)|=|\dfrac{nx}{1 + nx}-1|=|\frac{nx-1-nx}{1+nx}|=\frac{1}{1+nx}$ Now $0<x\Rightarrow 0<nx \Rightarrow 1<1+nx \Rightarrow \frac{1}{1+nx} < 1$ But then I do not know how to proceed further... For $f_n(x) = \dfrac{x^n}{1 + x^n}$ ; on  $[0, 2]$ we see that $f_n(x)=0$ for all $x\in [0,1)$ at $x=1$ we have $f_n(x)=\frac{1}{2}$ and $f_n(x)=1$  for all $x\in[1,2]$ so limit function is :
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & x \in [0,1) \\ \frac{1}{2}, & x=1,\\ 1&x\in[1,2] \end{cases}$$
so the limit function is not continuous so convergence is not uniform. For $f_n(x)=n^2x^2e^{-nx}$ over $(0,\infty)$ we have $f_n(x)=\frac{n^2x^2}{e^{nx}}$. But $e^{nx}$ diverges faster that $n^2x^2$ so limit function is $f\equiv 0$. But then at $x=\frac{1}{n}$ we have $f_n(x)=\frac{1}{e}$ so I can not say that $|f_n(x)-f(x)|< \epsilon $ for all $x$ and for all $n\geq N$ for some $N$ if my epsilon is less than $\frac{1}{e}$ thus the convergence is Not uniform. For $f_n(x)=(\cos (\pi n!x))^{2n}$ on $[0,1]$ at $x=0$ we have $f_n(x)=1$ and for $x\in(0,1]$ we have $f_n(x)\rightarrow 0$ 
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 1, & x=0 \\ 0, & x\in(0,1]. \end{cases}$$ so the limit function is not continuous so convergence is not uniform. $For f_n(x)=n^2x(1-x^2)^n$ on $[0,1]$ limit function is $f\equiv 0$ Now if i consider $|f_n(x)-f(x)|=n^2x(1-x^2)^n$ by considering derivative i have seen that maximum value is obtained at $x^2=\frac{1}{2n+1}$ so for uniform convergence we should make sure $f_n(x)$ for $x^2=\frac{1}{2n+1}$ goes to $0$ but then$f_n(x)=\dfrac{n^2}{}\sqrt{2n+1}(\frac{2n}{2n+1})^n$  but the limit does not even exist. So, the convergence is not uniform. Thank you for sparing your valuable time in checking my solutions. Once somebody confirm that every thing is fine and no modifications needed i would delete this question so please post only comments.

637918,My proof: Frobenius Map generates $\mbox{Gal}(\mathbb F_{p^n}/\mathbb F_p)$,"I would like to ask, whether anyone can confirm or correct the following version of the proof that the Frobenius map generates the Galois Group of a finite field. Proof First note that $\newcommand{\Fpn}{\mathbb F_{p^n}}\newcommand{\Fp}{\mathbb F_p}\newcommand{\GalFpn}{\mbox{Gal}(\Fpn/\Fp)}\#\GalFpn=[\Fpn:\Fp]=n$. I want to show that the Frobenius map $\newcommand{\Fr}{\mbox{Fr}}\Fr:\Fpn\rightarrow\Fpn$ given by $\alpha\mapsto\alpha^p$ generates the Galois Group of the extension $\Fpn\supset\Fp$. To see this I will show the following two statements. $\Fr$ is an element of $\GalFpn$ $\Fr$ has order $n$ Statement 1 Since the group $\Fp^*$ has $p-1$ elements is follows that $a\in\Fp$ satisfies $a^{p-1}=1$ so that $\Fr(a)=a^p=a$. This shows that $\Fr$ fixes $\Fp$. Now note that $\Fr$ is injective since $\alpha^p=0$ if and only if $\alpha=0$ (there are no zero divisors in a field). Since we have a finite field $\Fpn$ an injective map is also surjective. This shows that $\Fr$ is bijective so $\Fr$ is contained in $\GalFpn$. Statement 2 Next we must establish that $\Fr$ has order $n$. Consider the multiplicative group $\Fpn^*$. This is a cyclic group with $p^n-1$ elements, so we have an $\alpha\in\Fpn$ of order $p^n-1$. Thus
$$
\alpha^p,\alpha^{p^2},...,\alpha^{p^n}
$$
will be $n$ distinct elements which is really just to say that
$$
\Fr(\alpha),\Fr^2(\alpha),...,\Fr^n(\alpha)
$$
are $n$ distinct elements. This shows that $\Fr$ has order $n$ so that it generates $\GalFpn$.","['galois-theory', 'finite-fields', 'proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra']"

637930,When does analytic continuation respect functional equation,"This is a subtle point about analytic continuation. Let $\Gamma(s)$ be the analytic continuation of $\gamma(s) := \int_0^\infty e^{-t}t^{s-1}dt$ to $\Bbb C \setminus \Bbb Z_{<0}$, the latter function being only defined for $\operatorname {Re}(s)\ge 0$. Notice that one can prove from the definition of $\gamma(s)$ that it satifies the functional equation $\gamma(s+1) = s\gamma(s)$ where it is defined. Stein and Shakarchi claim on page 162 of their book complex analysis that because $\Gamma (s)$ and $\gamma(s)$ agree on $\operatorname {Re}(s)\ge 0$ and $\Gamma(s)$ is holomorphic away from its poles, the functional equation stated above is also true $\Gamma(s)$ wherever it is holomorphic, and takes the form $\operatorname{res}_{s=-n} \Gamma(s+1)=(-n)\operatorname{res}_{s=-n} \Gamma(s)$ at the poles of $\Gamma(s)$. My question is whether the above reasoning is really correct, and, if so, why. I see why it is true for the gamma function because $\Gamma(s)$ was extended from $\gamma(s)$ using precisely the functional equation of $\gamma(s)$, but could one know that this is true if one extended $\gamma(s)$ by a power series? In other words, (why) is it in general true that any functional equation $E(f(s),s)=0$  of a holomorphic function $f(s)$ defined on a connected domain $\omega$ will also hold for the analytic continuation $F(z)$ of $f(s)$ into a larger connected domain $\Omega \supset \omega$.","['analyticity', 'complex-analysis']"
