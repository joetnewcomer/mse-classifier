2167372,Pdf of limiting distribution of $T_n = X_n - n$,"Given $T_n$ is a discrete r.v. with pmf $\ f_{X_n}(t) =  \frac{1}{n}$ for $x = n^2$, $ 1-\frac{1}{n}$ for $x=0$,  and $\ 0$ otherwise. Define $T_n = X_n - E(X_n)$. Find the pmf (or pdf) of the limiting distribution. My attempt: First, since $X_n$ is a discrete r.v, $E(X_n) = n^2\frac{1}{n} + 0(1-\frac{1}{n}) + 0 = n$. Thus $T_n = X_n - n$. Now, $F_{T_n}(t) = P(T_n\leq t) = P(X_n\leq n+t) = 1$ if $t\geq n^2-n$, $= 1-\frac{1}{n}$ if $-n\leq t < n^2 - n$ and $= 0$ if $t< -n$. Thus, as $n\rightarrow \infty$, $F_{T_n}(t) = 1$ for $t\in (-\infty, \infty)$ (is this a correct interval?), we conclude that $T_1, T_2, \ldots$ converges in distribution to a degenerate r.v $T$ whose pmf is $f_{T}(t) = 1$.

2167388,"Find time, when angle between the minute and hour hands are given","The question which I was trying to solve is: Find the time between four and five o' clock when the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is $78^\circ$. My approach: At four o' clock, the hour hand and the minute hand of the clock will be at 4 and 12 respectively, hence the angle they make will be $120^\circ$. Let us assume some 'x' minutes have passed since then when the hands of the clock finally acquired the position described in the question. In 'x' minutes, the minute hand would have moved by $6x^\circ$, at the same time the hour hand would have moved by $0.5x^\circ$. At that position, the separation between them as given by the question is $78^\circ$. Hence the equation we can derive from here is: $120^\circ + 0.5x^\circ - 6x^\circ = 78^\circ$ Solving for 'x' I get $x = \left(\frac{84}{11}\right)$ minutes. Hence, as per my calculation since $\left(\frac{84}{11}\right)$ minutes have elapsed since four o' clock, the time in question should be around 7~8 minutes past 4. The answer to the exercise given in the book: At $\left(\frac{84}{11}\right)$ and 36 minutes past 4. Can someone explain me, where did I go wrong?","['angle', 'trigonometry']"

2167425,Integrating $e^x / (e^x - 2)$,"Well, I expected this to be a fairly simple task, but in the online portal of my uni it is stated I got zero points for it, although I recall pretty clearly this is exactly what I did. Where is my mistake then? Task: $\int \frac{e^x}{e^x - 2}dx$ First I applied a substitution, as I always find it nice to have just a lone variable below fraction to see possible connections to standard integrals. So I used u = $e^x - 2$. This also requires u' or $\frac{du}{dx}$ which = $e^x$. Rearranging this gives dx = $\frac{du}{e^x}$ which we then insert.
So now we have: $\int \frac{u + 2}{u} * \frac{du}{e^x}$ {I am expressing the $e^x$ in numerator with my substitution too, is this good practice? Or should I leave it as just $e^x$ next time? In next step it is seen that it wasn't so smart here, but what about a general rule?} I now see that I can shorten ${e^x}$ if I undo the substitution in the numerator again: $\int \frac{e^x -2 + 2}{u} * \frac{du}{e^x}$ {I now shorten ${e^x}$ by crossing it out in denominator of $\frac{du}{e^x}$ and cross out the whole numerator of $\frac{e^x -2 + 2}{u}$ and replace it with 1. Or would further explanations be needed here?}
This leaves: $\int \frac{1}{u}du$ which is a standard integral = ln(u).
At last I undo the substitution: u = $e^x -2$ which leaves as our result: ln($e^x -2$) I then add the absolute value due to the behaviour of ln:
Final solution: ln($|e^x -2|$) + C","['integration', 'exponential-function', 'calculus']"
2167426,Why are large Hermitian Toeplitz matrices approximately diagonalized by sinusoids?,"A Toeplitz matrix $T$ is characterized by $T_{jk}=t_{j-k}$ for some numbers $t_k$ (so its entries are constant along each diagonal). A Toeplitz operator is (for my purposes) a mapping from $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$ to $\ell^q(\mathbb{Z})$ which can be represented by a doubly infinite Toeplitz matrix. (Here $q$ could be anything, not necessarily the Holder conjugate of $p$.) I've seen in the literature, for example at http://jfi.uchicago.edu/~leop/SciencePapers/jstat9_05_p05012.pdf that the eigenvectors of Hermitian Toeplitz operators are given by sinusoids. Similarly, given suitable decay, large but finite Hermitian Toeplitz matrices have approximately sinusoidal eigenvectors. I can look into details about the convergence myself (especially since this is apparently relatively technical), but the issue about the operators seems to be treated as rather trivial in the literature. For example that paper pretty much says it follows immediately from translation invariance, and I can't seem to follow that. What is the basic idea here? I don't need all the details, I can iron some of them out myself. If it is relevant, the particular case I am handling has $t_k=a^{|k|}$ where $0<a<1$. It seems that the intuition is about a connection to circulant matrices. Given a symmetric $n \times n$ Toeplitz matrix $T$, we can define a ""circulant approximation"" $C$ by $c_{jk}=\begin{cases} t_0 & j=k \\
t_{j-k} + t_{(n-1)-(j-k)} & j \neq k \end{cases}$. If we now consider the sequence $T_n$ of such Toeplitz matrices generated by a $t \in \ell^1$, and a corresponding sequence of circulant matrices $C_n$, then $T_n$ and $C_n$ approach one another in Hilbert-Schmidt norm. This ensures that the eigenvalues are close. Additionally, the eigenvectors of the circulant matrix are complex exponentials (specifically, the columns of the discrete Fourier transform, or maybe its inverse). So we might hope that the eigenvectors are close too. How can we understand this similarity?","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'asymptotics', 'linear-algebra', 'operator-theory']"
2167439,Proof of Wald's second identity?,"I am very confused about the last step in the proof.

Then $S_n$ and $S_{\tau}-S_n$ are independent, so $\lim_{n\to\infty}E(2S_n(S_{\tau}-S_n)1_{\tau>n})=\lim_{n\to\infty}E(2S_n)E(S_{\tau}-S_n)=0$?(Not sure about this step since $\tau$ is unbounded.) Then we still need to show $\lim_{n\to\infty}E((S_{\tau}-S_n)^2)1_{\tau>n})=0$, why the lecture note says we need to show $\lim_{n\to\infty}E((S_{\tau}-S_n))1_{\tau>n}|\mathscr{F}_n)=0$?","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

2167505,A question about differentiating equations that are impossible to solve for a variable,"I thought I had a good idea on why/how implicit differentiation works until I read the following passage in my Calculus book: Furthermore, implicit differentiation works just as easily for equations such as
  $$x^5+5x^4y^2+3xy^3+y^5=1$$
  which are actually impossible to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ My problem with it is the following: The way we go about differentiating, for instance, $xy=1$ is by differentiating the whole equation through with respect to $x$ and treating $y$ as a function of $x$. But (and at least that's how I see it)  we can only treat $y$ as $f(x)$ because the equation determines $y$ as a function of $x$ in a relation that can ben written expliclity (in this case, $y=\frac{1}{x}$). If we have an equation such as the quoted one, in which we just can't solve for $y$, doesn't that mean that $y$ is not a function of $x$? In such a case, wouldn't treating it as such be an invalid move? I hope I have made myself understood. Any clarification will be appreciated. Thanks","['derivatives', 'calculus']"

2167621,"""Natural"" categories where monomorphisms differ from injective morphisms","I started reading Algebra Chapter 0 on my own, and ran into the definition of a monomorphism for a category. My initial thought was that this was simply the same as the definition of injective. However, it seems at this point in the book, he has not defined injectivity for morphisms in general, only for functions between sets. In the functions between sets case, monomorphisms are injective functions. However, in general it looks like monomorphisms are a weaker than injective morphism. Monomorphisms seems to be ""left cancelable"" whereas injectivity suggests there is another morphism that forces the morphism to be ""left cancelable"". As I said, injective morphism has not been defined, but I would say the definition in my head is a morphism $f \in \text{Hom}_C(A, B)$ is injective if there exists $g \in \text{Hom}_C(B, A)$ such that $gf = 1_A$. The definition of monomorphism given is $f \in \text{Hom}_C(A, B)$ is a monomorphism if for $\alpha', \alpha'' \in \text{Hom}_C(Z, A)$ we have $f\alpha' = f\alpha''$ implies $\alpha'= \alpha''$. Clearly an injective morphism is a monomorphism, but the converse seems likely false. My counter example is a category with two objects $A, B$ with a single morphism $f \in \text{Hom}_C(A, B)$ (and of course the identity morphisms for $A$ and $B$). The composition rule will be easy since I can only compose $f$ with identity morphisms. Now $f$ is clearly a monomorphism since the only thing $\alpha'$ and $\alpha''$ can be in the definition is $1_A$, thus necessarily the same. But $f$ is definitely not injective, as there is no morphism at all in $\text{Hom}_C(B, A).$ This counter example feels really contrived. Most the categories I know about seem to behave much like category of sets with functions as morphisms, i.e. monomorphisms are injective morphisms. Is there an example of a category that we deal with all the time (even though we might not call it a category in polite company) where the monomorphisms are not necessarily injective? Thanks! Any insights are appreciated.","['category-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

  where $B_{ij}$ are coefficients and $B_{ij} = B_{ji}, B_{ii} = 0, \forall i, j$.

Intuitively, this value is the expected average value of a submatrix of $\mathbf{B}$ where the rows (and columns) are picked randomly. It can be evaluated in exponential time by enumerating all the scenarios. But I am wondering if there are any methods that can evaluate this expectation in polynomial time. Note that if we can evaluate 
$$\mathbb{E}\left(\sum_i \sum_j X_i X_j B_{ij} \Big| \sum_i X_i = m\right)$$

Of course for $z=0, \alpha = \omega_1/2$ and I think this plays a role. In my attempts to show this I have been writing $$
\frac{\omega_1}{2} + \alpha = \wp^{-1}(E_1 + z)
$$
and trying to take advantage of the information I have since it clearly is important here. It is also interesting to note that my numerical evidence also points to the exact opposite of this when $z<0$, e.g. $\alpha \in i\mathbb{R}$. I am aware of the Whittaker and Watson exercise which shows that in this case $\wp$ takes on real values on the fundamental lattice, but this does not imply that it doesn't take on real values away from the lattice. Further I am aware that if $\omega_1/2+\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ is a solution then so is $\omega_1/2+\alpha + 2\omega_3 \notin \mathbb{R}$ so I want an answer mod the lattice.","['complex-analysis', 'elliptic-functions']"

2167985,Let n be a perfect square. Use direct proof to show that n-1 is composite.,"This is the following practice problem from the textbook, Mathematics, A Discrete Introduction by Scheinerman. $1.1$ Let $n$ be a perfect square. Use direct proof to show that if $n \ge 9 $ then $ n -1 $ is composite. This is the direct proof that I have so far: 
$$ My \; Solution $$
Suppose $n$ is a perfect square. Then there exists some integer $a$ such that $a*a = n$. Suppose then that $n-1$ is composite when $n \ge 9 $. Then there is an integer $b$ such that  $ 1 < b < n-1 $ and $ b|n-1 $. Then $1<b<a^2-1$ and so $b|a^2-1$. If b divides $a^2-1$, which can be factored down to $(a-1)(a+1)$. So $b|(a-1)(a+1)$ and such there are already at least two factors of $n-1$:$ 1, a-1,a+1, a^2-1$ (aka $n-1$). Thus $n-1$ is composite. $$qed$$

The first question is whether there's a relationship between two paired ordinal variables, more specifically, these variables are the Apgar-scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes, used in obstetrics. My first intention was to use Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, due to the description of the variables. But my statistics notes of back in the days mention a few times that when searching a relationship it is preferred to use correlation, rather than Wilcoxon, which would be more preferred when searching a difference. 
If it is correct to search correlation, I assume this would be the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, due to the ordinal character of the variables. As for the second question, is to find whether there's a difference in the need of extra care (nominal) when the duration of pregnancy is accounted for. The duration of pregnancy is divided into two categories, either less than 37 weeks or between 37 and 42 weeks. Due to the rather obvious greater than/lesser than character of the latter, I interpreted this as an ordinal variable. Because I'm working with two categorical variables here, I was rooting for a Chi-squared test, but, as I heard from my colleagues, a binary logistic regression would also be possible, I never learnt anything about the latter in the past, so I don't know if this would be a better fit.

They are generally very efficient. Suppose you have two arbitrary planar ellipses, sharing a focus $O$. Their second foci are $A$ and $B$. A bi-tangential ellipse would be a third one, also sharing the common focus point, and is is tangential to both the ellipses. It has its own second focus, $P$. For any given pair of orbits, there are an infinite amount of such bi-tangential ellipses. The tangential points are where a ray from $P$ through $A$ or $B$ crosses the perimeter of the ellipses. All possible locations of point $P$ are inside both ellipses, along a straight line. This line is a normal to the line $AB$, and is crossing it in $I$.

But the Mathematics professor (interviewing him) said that as both, the line and the plane stretch to infinity we cannot compare them.Therefore there are only two possibilities - $C$ will either lie on the line or on the plane.So, probability is equally distributed.Thus answer will be 0.5. The whole argument lies within the point Whether two infinities can be compared or not . Although he also wasn't satisfied but he couldn't argue further because he didn't knew two Infinities can be compared!(For example the set of all Real Numbers is strictly bigger than set of all Natural Numbers which can be proved by Cantor's Diagonal Argument) We can compare cardinality of two infinities and tell which one is relatively bigger and I couldn't find any One-One and On-to function for the points of line and the plane and I am pretty sure I wouldn't find any.(To explain that they are equal) But as the interviewer himself was a Mathematics professor, I couldn't simply neglect his answer.

(If there is a better way to phrase this, let me know in the comments.) So my idea was that the slope of the line perpendicular to $f(x)$ equal $\frac{b}{a}=-\frac{1}{\frac{d}{dx}f(x)}$.  Let the distance between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ along that line be $r$. And $a^2+b^2=r^2$.  So when we solve individually for $a$ and $b$ in the first equation, substitute in the second, then solve for $a$ and $b$ again, we get $$a=\frac{r}{\sqrt{1+\left(\cfrac{1}{\frac{d}{dx}f\left(x\right)}\right)^2}},\\b=\frac{r}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{d}{dx}f\left(x\right)\right)^2}}$$
So for a value $t$ we would have

2169554,Why do faithful group actions yield faithful isotropy representations?,"Let $M$ be a homogeneous space for a Lie group $G$. Then given any point $p \in M$, we have $M \cong G/H$ where $H$ is the isotropy group of $p$ ($H:= \{h \in G: hp = p\}$). It follows that there is a group homomorphism $\rho:H\to GL(T_pM)$ given by $\rho(h):= (h_*)_p$. I came across the following paraphrased statement without proof in ""Metric structures in differential geometry"" by Walschap: ""It is not difficult to show that if $M$ is connected and $G$ acts faithfully on $M$, then $\rho$ is injective and thus defines a faithful representation of $H$."" Question: Why is this true? I'm been stuck proving this. What I've tried: I know that if $M$ were a connected Riemannian homogeneous space ($G$ acts by isometries) with $G$ acting faithfully, then the isotropy representation is always faithful. This is because if $\exists p \in M$ and $h \in G$ with $hp = p$ and $(h_*)_p = id_{T_pM}$, then $(q \mapsto hq) = id_M$, and since the action is faithful then $h = e$. The proof is an open-closed argument using the fact that isometries map geodesics to geodesics. I'm not sure if it is possible to adapt this argument. I was hoping I could replace ""geodesics"" by ""integral curves of the infinitesimal generators of the group action"", but I haven't managed to get anywhere. Any hints/solutions would be greatly appreciated.","['principal-bundles', 'homogeneous-spaces', 'differential-geometry', 'lie-groups']"

2169643,"If $\alpha(X_{0}, X_{n}) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, is the process $\{X_n\}_n$ strongly mixing?","Let $\{X_n\}_{n\in\mathbb Z}$ be a strictly stationary sequence of random variables. 
  If $\alpha(X_{0}, X_{n}) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, is $\{X_n\}_n$ strongly mixing? Intuitively : To establish that a stationary sequence of random variables is strongly mixing, is it sufficient to check any pair of variables, one from the past versus one from the future? Notation Following usual conventions, let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space and $\sigma(\dots)$ denote the $\sigma$-field $\subset \mathcal{F}$ generated by $(\dots)$.
For any two $\sigma$-fields $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{F}$, define the following measure of dependence
$$
\alpha(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}) 
= 
\sup\lvert P(A \cap B) - P(A)P(B) \rvert, 
A\in\mathcal{A}, B\in\mathcal{B}
$$
We write $\alpha(X,Y) \equiv \alpha(\sigma(X),\sigma(Y))$ for random variables $X,Y$. Let $\{X_n\}_{n\in\mathbb Z}$ be a strictly stationary sequence of random variables.  The strong mixing coefficient (in this strictly stationary case) is
$$
\alpha(n) = \alpha(\sigma(\dots, X_{-1}, X_{0}), \sigma(X_{n}, X_{n+1}, X_{n+2}, \dots))
$$
The sequence is strongly mixing ($\alpha$-mixing) if $\alpha(n) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Why I am puzzled I would like to use a central limit theorem under weak dependence (strong mixing), and have established that $\alpha(n) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, but am worried about the jump from 'any pair of random variables tend to independent if they are far enough apart' to 'the future is independent from the past if the separation is large enough'.

2169826,Instanton Moduli Space on ALE Spaces?,"I've recently been learning about moduli spaces of instantons on $\mathbb{C}^{2}=\mathbb{R}^{4}$.  From what I can gather, one can consider the framed moduli space of torsion-free sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^{2}$ of rank $N$ and second Chern class $k$, which we denote $\mathcal{M}(k,N)$.  I believe in the rank one case, we can identify this moduli space with the symmetric product of $\mathbb{C}^{2}$, which of course can be crepantly resolved to the Hilbert scheme.  In other words, $$\text{Hilb}^{k}(\mathbb{C}^{2}) \to \text{Sym}^{k}(\mathbb{C}^{2}) = \mathcal{M}(k,1)$$ From what I can gather, this is what's known as the ""instanton moduli space on $\mathbb{C}^{2}$.""  There is then this whole ""geometric engineering"" story by Vafa, Hollowood, et. al. where they consider either the $\chi_{y}$ genus of these moduli spaces or the elliptic genus $\text{Ell}_{y,q}$ and construct the instanton partition function: $$ \sum_{k} p^{k} \chi_{y} (\text{Hilb}^{k}(\mathbb{C}^{2})) \,\,\,\,\,\, \text{or} \,\,\,\,\,\, \sum_{k} p^{k} \text{Ell}_{y,q} (\text{Hilb}^{k}(\mathbb{C}^{2}))$$ One can then show that these partition functions are very remarkably equal to partition functions in topological string theory on certain Calabi-Yau varieties. So really I'm curious about replacing $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ with the ALE spaces, specifically the $A_{N}$ resolutions the the singularities $\mathbb{C}^{2}/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a finite subgroup of $SU(2)$.  The above story with the Hilbert schemes was only for the rank one case, $N=1$ so it's very tempting to hope that maybe the higher rank moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}(k,N)$ might be related to the $A_{N}$ resolutions somehow?  I was hoping someone could help me understand what the moduli space of instantons on ALE spaces looks like, and whether there are nice partition functions like the ones above arising from such a space.  I know there is physics literature here (like the Vafa-Witten https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9408074.pdf ) but I'm having serious issues navigating the physics literature.  Does considering the Hilbert scheme of points on the $A_{N}$ resolutions provide anything of physical relevance, or do we need something more complicated perhaps?","['algebraic-geometry', 'string-theory', 'mathematical-physics', 'quantum-field-theory', 'differential-geometry']"
