3673899,"Sup norm of Fourier transform of $ \frac{\sin |x|}{|x|^\lambda} \mathbb 1_{\{2^k\le |x| <2^{k+1}\}}, \ 0<\lambda<n $","It seems to me that in a paper of Charles Fefferman ( open access ), it is claimed in the introduction that (3rd page of the PDF file, 'page 11', $\lambda\in(0,n)$ ) $$\sup_{\xi\in\mathbb R^n}\left| \int_{2^k\le  |x| <2^{k+1}} \frac{\sin |x|}{|x|^\lambda}  e^{2\pi i x \cdot\xi} \, dx \right| \le 2^{(\frac{n+1}2-\lambda)k}.$$ (He claims that Plancharel's formula should be used, I expect this to mean that we should compute the $L^\infty$ norm of the symbol.) By using asymptotics of Bessel functions, I can get the upper bound for $\xi\gg 1$ , but I am worried about $\xi\approx 0$ . At $\xi=0$ , the Fourier transform is just $\int\frac{\sin\dots}{\dots} dx$ leading to the estimate ( $C_n$ is the volume of the unit $n$ -sphere) $$ \left| \int_{2^k\le  |x| <2^{k+1}} \frac{\sin |x|}{|x|^\lambda}   \, dx \right|  \le C_n  2^{(n-\lambda)k} $$ which is bigger for $n>1$ ? Am I missing something simple? Calculation details can be provided on request.","['fourier-analysis', 'harmonic-analysis', 'fourier-transform', 'functional-analysis', 'bessel-functions']"
3673913,"Is there a way to give an injective function from the set of all finite natural sequences to $\mathbb{N}$, without relying on prime numbers?","I'm trying to prove that $|\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\mathbb{N}^k|=|\mathbb{N}|$ . I have an idea, but in order for it to work, I must define, rather conviniently, a function $$G\colon\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\mathbb{N}^k\to\mathbb{N}$$ that, according to what I have found is needed, must be injective among (probably) other things. The problem here is that for as long as I've been trying, nothing comes to my mind as to how to do it without relying on prime numbers. That said, I'd like to know if it is even possible to define an injective (let alone all the other properties that I surely need) function without the use of prime numbers. Please note that I'm not looking for a full answer, maybe just a hint if it is actually the case. Thanks in advance.",['elementary-set-theory']
3673915,If $f$ is a bijection of $A$ onto $B$ show $f^{-1}$ is a bijection of $B$ onto $A$,"If this is a duplicate you can close this post. Introduction to Real Analysis (Robert G. Bartle) 18. (b) If $f$ is a bijection of $A$ onto $B$ , show that $f^{-1}$ is a bijection of $B$ onto $A$ . Attempt: If $f$ is a bijection $A$ onto $B$ then if $x\in A$ then $f(x)\in B$ and if $x_1\neq x_2$ then $f(x_1)\neq f(x_2)$ . By definition of inverse, $f^{-1}:=\left\{(f(a),a): B\times A, (a,f(a))\in f \right\}$ , so $f^{-1}$ is a surjection from $B$ to $A$ . Moreover if $f(x_1)\neq f(x_2)$ then $x_1\neq x_2$ implying injection since $f$ is already injective hence $f^{-1}$ is injective. Since $f^{-1}$ is injective and surjective $f^{-1}$ is also bijective. I doubt I’m correct. For one, I want the final step to be if $x_1\neq x_2$ then $f^{-1}(x_1)\neq f^{-1}(x_2)$ .

3674092,Which vectors have unique representation when it isn't a direct sum?,"I know that $V = U \oplus W$ means that every $v \in V$ can be written uniquely as $v = u + w$ for some $u \in U, w \in W$ . However, what happens if $V = U + W$ is not direct? Then this means that some vector $v$ does not have a unique representation. But can we say exactly which vectors have a unique representation, and which don't? Is this even a useful question?

3674239,"Prove that there exists $c\in[0,1]$ such that $\int_0^cf(t)dt=f(c)^3.$","Question: Let $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function with $\int_0^1f(t)dt=0$ . Prove that there exists $c\in[0,1]$ such that $$\int_0^cf(t)dt=f(c)^3.$$ Solution: Let $g:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ be such that $$g(x)=\int_0^xf(t)dt-f(x)^3, \forall x\in[0,1].$$ Now since $f$ is continuous $\forall x\in[0,1]$ , thus, by the first fundamental theorem of calculus, we can conclude that $g$ is continuous $\forall x\in[0,1]$ . Thereafter, observe that $g(x)=0$ for some $x\in[0,1]\iff \int_0^xf(t)dt=f(x)^3$ for some $x\in[0,1]$ . Hence, to prove the statement of the problem it is sufficient to show that $g(c)=0$ for some $c\in[0,1]$ . Now $g(0)=-f(0)^3$ and $g(1)=-f(1)^3$ . Observe that if $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ are of different signs, then $g(0)$ and $g(1)$ are also of different signs, in which case, by IVT we can conclude that $\exists c\in(0,1)\subset[0,1],$ such that $g(c)=0$ . Hence, we are done in this case. Again, if $f(0)=0$ or $f(1)=0$ , then at least one of $g(0)$ and $g(1)=0$ , in which case we are done. Now, we are left with the case that both $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ are of the same sign. Thus, let us assume WLOG that $f(0)>0$ and $f(1)>0$ . Hence, $g(0)<0$ and $g(1)<0$ . Now since $\int_0^1f(t)dt=0$ and $f(0),f(1)>0$ , implies that $\exists$ at least two points $a,b\in(0,1)$ , such that $b>a$ satisfying $f(a)=f(b)=0$ . Thus, we can conclude that $\exists c_1\in(0,1),$ such that $f(x)>0, \forall x\in[0,c_1)$ and $f(c_1)=0$ . Hence, we have $$g(c_1)=\int_0^{c_1}f(t)dt-f(c_1)^3=\int_0^{c_1}f(t)dt>0.$$ Thus, we have $g(c_1)>0$ and $g(1)<0$ , which implies that, by IVT we can conclude that $\exists c\in(c_1,1)\subset[0,1]$ , such that $g(c)=0$ . Hence, we are done in this case too. Hence, we are done with all the cases and in each case we have shown that $\exists c\in[0,1]$ such that $g(c)=0$ . Thus, we are done.

3674276,How to prove this algebraic version of the sine law?,"How to solve the following problem from Hall and Knight's Higher Algebra ? Suppose that \begin{align}
a&=zb+yc,\tag{1}\\
b&=xc+za,\tag{2}\\
c&=ya+xb.\tag{3}
\end{align} Prove that $$\frac{a^2}{1-x^2}=\frac{b^2}{1-y^2}=\frac{c^2}{1-z^2}.\tag{4}$$ (I suppose that $x,y,z$ are real numbers whose moduli are not equal to $1$ .) I discovered this problem from chapter 3 of Prelude to Mathematics by W. W. Sawyer. Sawyer thought that this problem arose from the sine law: let $a,b,c$ be respectively the lengths of the edges opposite to three vertices $A,B,C$ of a triangle. Define $x=\cos A$ and define $y,z$ analogously. Now equalities $(1)-(3)$ simply relate $a,b$ and $c$ to each other by the cosines of the angles and $(4)$ is just a rewrite of the sine law $$
\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}.
$$ However, the algebraic version $(4)$ looks more general. For example, it does not state that $a,b,c$ must be positive or that they must satisfy the triangle inequality. Sawyer wrote that this isn't a hard problem, but he didn't provide any solution. I can prove $(4)$ using linear algebra. Suppose that $(a,b,c)\ne(0,0,0)$ (otherwise $(4)$ is obvious). Rewrite $(1)-(3)$ in the form of $M\mathbf a=0$ : $$\begin{bmatrix}-1&z&y\\ z&-1&x\\ y&x&-1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a\\ b\\ c\end{bmatrix}=0.$$ Since $x^2,y^2,z^2\ne1$ , $M$ has rank $2$ and $D=\operatorname{adj}(M)$ has rank $1$ . Hence all columns of $D$ are parallel to $(a,b,c)^T$ and $\frac{d_{11}}{d_{21}}=\frac{d_{12}}{d_{22}}=\frac{a}{b}$ . Since $M$ is symmetric, $D$ is symmetric too. Therefore $\frac{1-x^2}{1-y^2}=\frac{d_{11}}{d_{22}}=\frac{d_{11}d_{12}}{d_{21}d_{22}}=\frac{a^2}{b^2}$ , i.e. $\frac{a^2}{1-x^2}=\frac{b^2}{1-y^2}$ . As this problem comes from Hall and Knight's book, I think there should be a more elementary solution.

3674286,How are the different definitions of a tensor the same definition?,"I'm mostly self taught in undergraduate physics and maths, so I haven't had much of an education in this stuff. Basically, I know how the theory of general relativity is formulated in terms of tensors and tensor equations. You equate components of the curvature tensor with components of the energy-momentum tensor, as in $R_{\mu \nu} -\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu \nu}$ . But I wasn't really satisfied with this, because of how much it seemed to depend on the components of the tensor. Hence I started to research other definitions of tensors (after all, vectors can be defined completely independently of components). What I found was that tensors are defined as multilinear maps: \begin{align} T: V^*\times \cdots \times V^*\times V\times \cdots \times V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}.\end{align} Now I understand all of the terms in this definition (e.g. dual spaces, direct products), but I don't know how this relates to the definition I've seen before in physics, as objects that are invariant under coordinate transformations: \begin{align}(T')^{m_1 \cdots} _{n_1 \cdots} = \frac{\partial (x')^{m_1}}{\partial x^{p_1}}\cdots \frac{\partial x^{q_1}}{\partial (x')^{n_1}}\cdots T^{p_1 \cdots}_{q_1 \cdots}.\end{align} So my question is this: how do these definitions relate to each other? They seem completely different, and I'm not even sure how to think of a ""physics tensor"" as a multilinear map to $\mathbb{R}$ . Also, if you're knowledgeable in physics, is there a form of the Einstein Field Equations that is completely independent of coordinates?","['physics', 'tensors', 'differential-geometry']"
3674375,The maths of 3D printing: what makes a set of $\mathbb R^3$ 3D-printable?,"Context (although it's not really important): For a project, I may have to print some complicated 3D sets. The only thing I know about these sets is that they are defined as bounded parts of $\mathbb R^3$ , are formed as a union of tiny balls, and may not be connected (I know that it is vague, but I'm also asking this question to modify the properties of this set to fit the criterion that allows a part of $\mathbb R^3$ to be 3D-printable). The question: So I'm looking for references about maths modelisations of 3D printing (only classics FDM/FFF 3D printers). I want to see whether it is possible to approximate my complicated set with a 3D printable one. So here I am looking for some reference about the maths of 3D printing in general. More specifically, I would like to answer the following questions: What kind of vector space and topology may define a ""3D printable"" set? (or what kind of structure may define this properly?) Given any bounded set, how to find the ""best"" (for some criteria that may depend on the problem) 3D printable approximation? Further details: For example, given a compact set over $\mathbb R^3$ , what makes it 3D printable? To make more sense, what criteria it must meet to have a 3D printable set that is a good approximation? It seems self-evident that a non-connected set will not be 3D-printable. But are all connected bounded set printable for a high enough resolution? It also seems evident that it depends on the resolution and the precision of the printer. But how to characterise it mathematically? $\longrightarrow$ According to the answer from @Ihf, they are generally triangulated polyhedra. I need some more information about it: what structure may we have over the set of triangulated polyhedra? Is there any good reference about it that I may read? If $\mathcal T\mathcal P$ denotes this set, is there any good description of $\overline{\mathcal T\mathcal P}$ ? (the closure of it in $\mathbb R^3$ as the usual metric space). This may give a good description of ""3D printable objects"" which might be $\overline{\mathcal T\mathcal P}$ (objects that are approximable with triangulation) or a subset of it (if we want some physical propriety to be verified). EDIT: I do not have any example, because of the reasons that I just added in the first paragraph of this post. I also edited the title to be more clear: I do not want to print something to illustrate some mathematical ""classic"" forms as suggested in a comment, but to print a set that is generated by iterated function systems for my case (I'm studying them in a general view, so I don't know yet which form I will try to print. That why I'm looking for criteria that it'd have to meet). EDIT2: added further details for question 1. Final edit: Since this subject seems not to be very documented with mathematical approaches, I accept the first answer I got, that answers my question. So to sum up, the set $\mathcal{TP}$ defined in my post answer the problem. And thus, the well approximable sets are the ones in $\overline{\mathcal{TP}}$ since we can approach them with any precision with 3D printable sets. I'm still interested though about good references on the mathematical description of 3D printing, so if you had any, do not hesitate to add another answer to complement the accepted one.","['general-topology', 'vector-spaces', '3d', 'reference-request']"

Protter containing Theorem 43 of Chapter 4. I'd assume you'd need to be familiar with the book to answer the following questions I have. Please correct me where I am having wrong assumptions. 1) He does not develop his notion of predictable representability for finite time-horizons.
How can he claim (in the red box) the set $\mathcal{A}$ of Brownian motion's stopped at $t_0$ to have the representation property? He avoids an obvious later conflict by assuming $M=M^{t_0}$ in the green box.
In the same way I don't get how he establishes/means $P=Q$ by looking only at $\mathcal{F}_{t_0}$ . How does ""assuming $X$ to be stopped at $t_0$ "" make the claim $\mathcal{M}^2(\mathcal{A})=\{P\}$ rigorous? What does he leave to the reader at that point? 2) Still in the red box: I am not familiar with the argument using the bounded Borel functions to show that $P=Q$ , how does it work? Apart from my issues from question 1), is it standard and/or mentioned somewhere in the rest of the book? 3) In the proof of Corollary 1 in the orange box, how can he claim $P$ to be extremal for $\mathcal{A}=\{X_1,\dots,X_n\}$ where $X_i$ are Brownian motions? They are not $L_2$ -martingales, and the book didn't develop the notion of extremal points for sets stemming from martingales not contained in $M^2$ , the space of $L_2$ martingales. And either way, he should refer to $\mathcal{M}^2(\mathcal{A})$ (not $\mathcal{A}$ ) when speaking of $P$ as an extremal point. I don't doubt that the notion can be extended to local $L_2$ martingales, does he assume the reader to think of that? If yes, I figure the statement is valid because it was shown in the proof of theorem 43 that $P|_{\mathcal{F}_t} = Q|_{\mathcal{F}_t}$ for all $t$ (and $\text{domain}(P)=:\mathcal{F}\supset\mathcal{F}_\infty$ is no problem because?)

First question: I know that on $\mathbb C$ , properties $2$ , $3$ , and $f'(z)=f(z)$ still hold. Is this a surprise, or coincidental? That is, in general is it true that if we have some formulas $F_1, \ldots, F_n$ (like the identities above, or things like continued fractions, etc) involving $g: \mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ , will those formulas $F_1,\ldots, F_n$ hold on $\mathbb C$ as well if we analytically extend $g$ to the complex plane?

The main objective here is to prove that limit of $\frac{b(x)-b(a)}{x-a}$ doesn't exist as $x\to a$ . So since We got the inequality for both cases we got $\frac{b(k)-b(a)}{k-a}$ - $\frac{b(d)-b(a)}{d-a}\ge\frac{b(k)-L(k)}{k-a}\ge 1/2$ and $\frac{b(k)-b(a)}{k-a}$ - $\frac{b(c)-b(a)}{c-a}\ge\frac{b(k)-L(k)}{k-a}\ge 1/2$ from it. I think we can conclude that the limit doesn't exists since $c,k,d$ are in the interval of the neighbourhood of $a$ . Then I checked book's answer which says: Every neighbourhood of $a$ contains an interval of the form $(a,a+1/2^{N-1}]$ and therefore points corresponding to c,k and d. So there can be no limit $g$ such that $|\frac{b(x)-b(a)}{x-a}-g|<1/5$ , for all $x$ inside any neighbourhood of $a$ . And my question again arised from the answer of book. Why is $|\frac{b(x)-b(a)}{x-a}-g|$ less than 1/5? Where and how did 1/5 come out of thin air? I think I don't understand the answer of book properly. Why did they choose that the $\epsilon=1/5$ and why not $1/2$ ? I think $\epsilon$ can't be chosen randomly there must be a way they got it. But which way? So I want to see how to prove that the $b(x)$ is not differentiable more rigorously?

Attempt: So I know how to do the following computations: $$\int^{x^2}_0 \frac{1}{\cos(t)} dt = \int^{x^2}_0 \sec(t)dt$$ $$\int^{x^2}_0 \frac{1}{\cos(t)} dt = [\ln|\tan(t)+\sec(t)|]^{x^2}_0$$ $$\int^{x^2}_0 \frac{1}{\cos(t)} dt = \ln|\tan(x^2)+\sec(x^2)| - \ln|\tan(0)+\sec(0)|$$ $$\int^{x^2}_0 \frac{1}{\cos(t)} dt = \ln|\tan(x^2)+\sec(x^2)| - \ln1$$ $$\int^{x^2}_0 \frac{1}{\cos(t)} dt = \ln|\tan(x^2)+\sec(x^2)|$$ Note: To find $\int \sec(t) dt$ I used the method of substitution found here . And then using the chain rule to differentiate ( $u=|\tan(x^2)+\sec(x^2)|$ so $F(x)=\ln u$ ), we get $F'(x)=\frac{2x}{\cos (x^2)} = 2x\sec (x^2)$ for $x\in[0, \frac{\pi}{4}]$ . However, this question was given in a real analysis course and I believe I need to use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (which is fine considering $F$ is continuous for $x\in[0, \frac{\pi}{4}]$ as stated in the question so not required to prove). I am familiar with two different (but equivalent) definitions of the FTC; this one and this one , but am unsure of which one to use. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","['integration', 'real-analysis', 'continuity', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

Claim: $f$ does not change it's sign in the interval $[0,1]$ . Proof: Let us assume that $f(x)>0$ at some $x=a$ and $f(x)<0$ at some $x=b$ , where $a,b\in[0,1]$ and $b>a$ . Now since $f$ is continuous in $[0,1]$ , thus by IVT we can conclude that $\exists c\in(a,b),$ such that $f(c)=0$ . Hence, we have $f(c)g(c)=0\ge 4c^2\implies 4c^2\le 0,$ but $c>0\implies 4c^2>0.$ Hence we arrive at a clear contradiction. Thus, we can conclude that $f$ does not change it's sign in the interval $[0,1]$ . Using our claim, we can also conclude that, $g$ does not change it's sign in the interval $[0,1]$ . Thus, either $f(x),g(x)>0, \forall x\in[0,1]$ or $f(x),g(x)<0, \forall x\in[0,1]$ . Observe that in any case $$\left|\int_0^1 f(x)dx\right|=\int_0^1|f(x)|dx\text{ and }\left|\int_0^1 g(x)dx\right|=\int_0^1|g(x)|dx.$$ Thus, by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have $$\left|\int_0^1 f(x)dx\right|\left|\int_0^1 g(x)dx\right|=\int_0^1|f(x)|dx\int_0^1|g(x)|dx\\=\int_0^1\left(\sqrt{|f(x)|}\right)^2dx\int_0^1\left(\sqrt{|g(x)|}\right)^2dx\\\ge \left(\int_0^1\sqrt{|f(x)|}.\sqrt{|g(x)|}dx\right)^2=\left(\int_0^1\sqrt{|f(x)g(x)|}dx\right)^2=\left(\int_0^1\sqrt{f(x)g(x)}dx\right)^2.$$ Now since $\forall x\in[0,1]$ , we have $$f(x)g(x)\ge 4x^2\implies \sqrt{f(x)g(x)}\ge 2x\\\implies\int_0^1\sqrt{f(x)g(x)}dx\ge \int_0^1 2x dx=1\\\implies \left(\int_0^1\sqrt{f(x)g(x)}dx\right)^2\ge 1.$$ Hence, we can conclude that $$\left|\int_0^1 f(x)dx\right|\left|\int_0^1 g(x)dx\right|\ge 1.$$ Thus, we can conclude that $$\left|\int_0^1 f(x)dx\right|\ge 1\text{ or }\left|\int_0^1 g(x)dx\right|\ge 1.$$ Hence, we are done.

The proof is based on the fact that the $L^2$ condition implies that there is a sequence of adapted $L^2$ ""simple processes"", $$\sigma_n(\omega,t)=\sum_{i=0}^{k}f_i(\omega)\cdot \mathbb{1}_{(t_i,t_{i+1}]}(t), ~~~(f_i\in L^2(\Omega,~\mathcal{F}_{t_i}),~t_0=0,~t_{k_n+1}=T)$$ converging to $X$ in $L^2(\Omega \times [0,T]).$ For $t\in (t_j,t_{j+1}]$ one defines $$(\int_0^T\sigma_ndW)(\omega,t)=f_j\cdot(W_{t}-W_{t_j}) +\sum_{i=0}^{j-1}f_i\cdot(W_{t_{i+1}}-W_{t_i}),$$ and then one shows that $t\mapsto (\int_0^T\sigma_ndW)(\omega,t)$ is continuous for all $\omega,n$ , and that for almost every $\omega$ , the functions $t\mapsto (\int_0^T\sigma_ndW)(\omega,t)$ satisfy the Weierstrass M test, and thus converge to a continuous function $t\mapsto Y(\omega,t)$ .  We define $\int_0^TXdW:=Y$ . That is all clear. Now the book I'm reading ( Intro to Stochastic Calculus Applied to Finance by Lamberton and Lapeyre) says we need to extend this integral by relaxing the $X\in L^2(\Omega \times [0,T])$ condition.  Namely the claim is that if $$\mathcal{H}= \{ X: \Omega \times [0,T]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}~~~|~~X ~is~\mathcal{F}_t- adapted, ~ and~for~almost~all~\omega~we~have~\int_0^T|X(\omega,t)|^2dt<\infty \}$$ and if $\mathcal{C}$ is the space of adapted and almost surely continuous processes on $\Omega\times [0,T]$ , then there exists a unique linear mapping $$\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\mathcal{C},~X\mapsto \int_0^T XdW$$ satisfying the following two properties This integral agrees with the previous definition for simple processes (the third centered line in this post). If $H_n$ is a sequence of processes in $\mathcal{H}$ such that the sequence of function $\bigg(\omega\mapsto\int_0^TH_n^2(\omega,t)dt\bigg)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converges in probability to $0$ , then the sequence $$\bigg(\omega\mapsto sup_{t\leq T}|(\int_0^T H_ndW)(\omega,t)|\bigg)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$$ also converges to $0$ in probability Finally here's my question: The book says that it is clear that conditions 1 and 2 imply that the new integral agrees with the old (almost surely for all $t\in [0,T]$ ) whenever the integrand $X$ is in $L^2(\Omega \times [0,T])$ . Why?? The only thing I can think to do is to again take a sequence of simple processes, $\sigma_n$ , converging to $X$ in $L^2(\Omega \times [0,T])$ .  Then clearly the sequence $$\bigg(\omega\mapsto\int_0^T|\sigma_n(s,\omega) ds - X(s,\omega)|^2 ds\bigg)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$$ converges to $0$ in $L^1(\Omega)$ and therefore converges to $0$ in probability. Thus by 2, we have that $$\bigg(\omega \mapsto sup_{0\leq t \leq T}\bigg|(\int_0^T \sigma_ndW)(\omega, t)-(\int_0^TXdW)(\omega, t)\bigg|\bigg)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$$ converges to zero in probability.  Now what we want is that for almost all $\omega$ , for all $t$ we have $$(\int_0^T \sigma_ndW)(\omega, t)-(\int_0^TXdW)(\omega, t)\rightarrow 0.$$ This would suffice because we know $\int_0^T \sigma_ndW$ agrees with the previously defined integral by property 1, and the sequence $\int_0^T \sigma_ndW$ converges for almost all $\omega$ for all $t$ to the previously defined integral of $X$ .  But as far as I can tell, convergence in probability doesn't guarantee this.","['stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-calculus', 'analysis']"

3676285,Commutation relation between covariant and Lie derivatives,"I am currently working on extrinsic riemannian geometry and I am looking for a sort of commutation relation between the covariant and Lie derivatives. To be more precise : considering an hypersurface $H \subset M$ of a riemannian manifold, $\nu$ a vector field normal to $H$ and $S$ its shape operator (or Wiengarten operator ) defined by $SX = \nabla_X \nu$ , you can consider normal geodesics emanating from $H$ as geodesics veryfing $\gamma(0) \in H$ , $\dot\gamma(0) = \nu$ . Writing the parameters of these geodesics $r$ , you get a vector field $\partial_r = \dot\gamma$ . If $(x^1,\ldots,x^n)$ are local coordinates on $H$ , then you have Fermi coordinates $(r,x^1,\ldots,x^n)$ on $M$ . We have the Ricatti equation, where $R_{\partial_r} = R(\partial_r,\cdot)\partial_r$ : \begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}_{\partial_r}S=\partial_r S = -S^2 - R_{\partial_r}
\end{align*} (in fact, the equation is still true while replacing $\mathcal{L}_{\partial_r}$ by $\nabla_{\partial_r}$ , it's a property of the shape operator). I want to find a differential equation for $\nabla_{\partial_j}S$ where $\partial_j = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}$ . My idea is to differentiate the Ricatti equation with respect to $\nabla_{\partial_j}$ and use a sort of commutation relation to get a differential equation involving $S$ , $\nabla_{\partial_j}S$ , $R$ , etc . with variable $r$ . So, my question is : do we have a nice relation between $\nabla_{\partial_j} \mathcal{L}_{\partial_r} S$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\partial_r}\nabla_{\partial_j}S$ ?

Prove that a set with an uncountable number of isolated points does not exist in $\mathbb{R}$ . (Added: June 2, 2020) Proof : Let $B = \{x_{1}, x_2, \dots\}$ be the set of isolated points of some set with an uncountable number of isolated points. Since each $x_i$ is an isolated point, $\exists \epsilon_i > 0 \textrm{ s.t. } N(x_i , \epsilon_i) \cap B = \{x_i\}$ which implies $N^*(x_i,  \epsilon_i) \cap B = \emptyset$ We claim that for any two distinct $x_a, x_b \in A$ , $N^{*}(x_a , \frac{\epsilon_a}{2}) \cap N^{*}(x_b , \frac{\epsilon_b}{2}) = \emptyset$ . Assume, to obtain a contradiction, that $\exists z$ satisfying $z \in N^{*}(x_a ; \frac{\epsilon_a}{2}) \cap N^{*}(x_b ; \frac{\epsilon_b}{2})$ . Without loss of generality, suppose $\epsilon_a \geq \epsilon_b$ . Then, \begin{equation*}
	            \left|x_a - x_b\right| = \left|(x_a -z) + (z - x_b)\right|
	             \leq \left|x_a -z \right| + \left|z - x_b\right| < \epsilon_{a/2} + \epsilon_{a/2} = \epsilon_{a}
	        \end{equation*} Thus, $\left|x_a - x_b\right| < \epsilon_{a} \implies x_b \in N^{*}(x_a ; \epsilon_a)$ which contradicts $N^{*}(x_a ; \epsilon_a) \cap B = \emptyset$ . Then, by the density of rationals in reals, we can find a $q_i \in \mathbb{Q}$ s.t. $q_i \in N^*(x_i ; \frac{\epsilon_i}{2})$ . This means that we can draw a $1-1$ correspondence between each $q_{i}$ and $x_{i}$ which is a contradiction since there are only a countable number of $q_{i}$ and an uncountable number of $x_{i}$ .","['general-topology', 'solution-verification', 'real-analysis']"

3676422,Edge probability and expected number of edges in the configuration model,"This question is related to question: Probability that exists at least an edge in the configuration model There is something I do not understand about the computation of the expected number of edges between $i$ and $j$ nodes in the configurational model , $p_{ij}$ . The argument given everywhere I've seen is: There are $2m$ stubs in the network, with $k_i$ in node $i$ and $k_j$ in node $j$ . Taking one stub from node $i$ , there are $k_j$ possible stubs to connect it to node $j$ , so the probability to connect it to node $j$ is $\frac{k_j}{2m-1}$ , the $2m-1$ because you can not connect it to the same stub you are coming from. There are $k_i$ stubs in node i, so the expected number of edges is just adding up the different probabilities and $p_{ij} = k_i \times \frac{k_j}{2m-1}$ . I do not understand step 3. I would think once there has been an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ , the probability to connect the next stub should change accordingly because there is one less available stub at node $j$ : $\frac{k_j-1}{2m-3}$ . But also, each new stub considered in node $i$ has two less possible stubs to be connected (because every other edge already connected has two stub ends), so the total available edges in the denominator should decrease as well: $2m-3$ , $2m-5$ , ..., $2m-2k_i-1$ . Instead, I'd proceed in this way: $$p_{ij} = 1 - \bar{p}_{ij}, $$ where $\bar{p}_{ij}$ is the probability there isn't any edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ . Then, $$\bar{p}_{ij} = \bar{p}_{{i_1}j} \times \bar{p}_{{i_2}j}\times \dots  \times \bar{p}_{{i_{k_i}}j}, $$ where $\bar{p}_{{i_1}j}$ is the probability there isn't an edge between the first stub in node $i$ to node $j$ and $\bar{p}_{{i_1}j} = \frac{2m-1-k_j}{2m-1}$ . Analogously for the other stubs, we get $$\bar{p}_{ij} = \frac{2m-1-k_j}{2m-1}  \frac{2m-3-k_j}{2m-3} \dots \frac{2m-2k_i-1-k_j}{2m-2k_i-1} = \left( 1 - \frac{k_j}{2m-1} \right)   \left( 1 - \frac{k_j}{2m-3} \right)  \dots \left( 1 - \frac{k_j}{2m-2k_i-1} \right).  $$ So $$p_{ij} = 1- \left( 1 - \frac{k_j}{2m-1} \right)   \left( 1 - \frac{k_j}{2m-3} \right)  ... \left( 1 - \frac{k_j}{2m-2k_i-1} \right).$$ I can recover from this expression the other one in the large number of edges limit $m \to \infty$ , then $2m-2k_i-1 \simeq ... \simeq 2m - 3 \simeq 2m - 1$ and $$p_{ij} \simeq 1- \left( 1 - \frac{k_j}{2m-1} \right)^{k_i} \simeq 1 - \left( 1 - \frac{k_i k_j}{2m-1} \right) = \frac{k_i k_j}{2m-1},$$ where in the second step I have used the series expansion $(1 - x)^a = 1 - ax + \mathcal{O}(x^2)$ for $x \to 0$ . Question: Does this mean that only the expected number of edges between $i$ and $j$ nodes in the configurational model is $p_{ij} = \frac{k_i k_j}{2m-1}$ in the large number of edges $m$ limit? If that is the case, I find it strange because they don't specify it in any of the sources I've looked. Instead, they seem to say $p_{ij} = \frac{k_i k_j}{2m-1}$ is the general expression which in the large number of edges limit becomes $p_{ij} = \frac{k_i k_j}{2m}$ .","['random-graphs', 'network', 'graph-theory', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

Then we define the space $\mathcal M_1(M)$ as the topological space $$\mathcal M_1(M) :=\left\{\mu;\ \mu\ \text{is a } \text{Borel probability measure on }M\right\} $$ endowed with the weak $^*$ topology, $\textit{i.e}.$ the topology generated by the basis of neighborhoods $$V(\mu;f_1,\ldots,f_n;\varepsilon):=\left\{\lambda\in\mathcal M_1(M);\ \left|\int f_i\  \mathrm{d}\mu - \int f_i\  \mathrm{d}\lambda\right|<\varepsilon, \ \forall \ i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}\right\}, $$ where $f_1,\ldots,f_n \in C^0_b(M)=\{g: M\to\mathbb R; \ g \text{ is a continuous bounded function}\}$ . It is well known that if $M$ is a  separable metric space. Then $M$ is compact $\iff$ $\mathcal{M}_1(M)$ is compact. The proof of this fact relies on the result "" $M$ is separable metric space then $\mathcal{M}_1(M)$ in the weak $^*$ topology is metrizable with Lévy–Prokhorov metric "". Question: If $M$ is a non-compact metric space $\Rightarrow$ $\mathcal M_1(M)$ a non-compact topological space in the weak $^*$ topology? My conclusions so far I think I have found a solution. Suppose that $M$ is a non-compact metric space then there exists a sequence $\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ , such that, $\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ does not admit convergent subsequênce. Therefore, the set $S = \{x_1, \ldots, x_i,\ldots \}\subset M$ is closed, moreover all subsets of $S$ are  closed as well. Now, consider the sequence $\{\delta_{x_i}\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\subset\mathcal M_1(M)$ (where $\delta_p$ is the Dirac measure ), we will show that $\{\delta_{x_i}\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ does not admit convergence subnet, and this will imply that $\mathcal M_1(M)$ is not compact in the weak $^*$ topology (because we would be able to find a net that does not admit convergent subnet). Suppose by reductio ad absurdum that there exist a directed set $(\mathcal B, \preccurlyeq)$ , an increasing function $\varphi: \mathcal B\to\mathbb{N}$ , such that $\lim_{\beta}\varphi(\beta)=\infty$ (or cofinal porperty) and $\mu\in\mathcal M_1(M)$ satisfying $$\lim_{\beta} \delta_{x_{\varphi(\beta)}} =\mu \in\mathcal M_1(M). $$ Let us, first of all, prove that $\mu(S)=1$ . Let $f: M\to\mathbb{R}$ a continuous bounded function such that $f(S)=\{1\}.$ Then, by the definition of weak $^*$ topology $$1 = \lim_\beta \int f \ \mathrm d \delta_{x_{\varphi(\beta)}} =   \int f \ \mathrm d \mu.$$ Now consider the continuous (since $S$ is closed) bounded functions \begin{align*}
g_n: M&\to\mathbb{[0,1]}\\
x&\mapsto \max\left\{ 1 - n \cdot d(x,S) ,0\right\},
\end{align*} so $g_n \to \mathbf{1}_S$ pointwiselly ( where $\mathbf{1}_S( S ) =\{1\}$ and $\mathbf{1}_S\left(M\setminus S\right) =\{0\}$ ) and each $g_n$ is a continuous bounded function such that $g_n(S)=\{1\}$ .

3676753,"Unexpected formulas for ""exactly $k$ sets"" and ""at least $k$ sets"" variations of the principle of inclusion-exclusion","There are two formulas that I have derived, and the difference between them is puzzling me. Let $n$ be a positive integer and $A_1,A_2,\ldots, A_n$ be finite sets, and let $k$ be an integer such that $1\le k\le n.$ The number of elements of $\displaystyle \bigcup_{i=1}^{n}{A_i}$ that lie in exactly $k$ of the $A_i$ is $$\sum_{m=k}^{n}{(-1)^{m+k}\binom{m}{k}\sum_{\substack{J\subseteq[n]\\ |J|=m}}{\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}\right|}}.$$ The number of elements of $\displaystyle \bigcup_{i=1}^{n}{A_i}$ that lie in at least $k$ of the $A_i$ is $$\sum_{m=k}^{n}{(-1)^{m+k}\binom{m-1}{k-1}\sum_{\substack{J\subseteq[n]\\ |J|=m}}{\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}\right|}}.$$ Here, $[n]$ denotes the section $\{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}$ of the positive integers. I am fairly certain that these formulas are correct, as I have tested them in various specific and general cases. For example, $k=1$ in the second formula yields the ordinary PIE formula. In fact, I used the first formula in conjunction with combinatorial identities to prove the second one; and I know that the first formula is true using a combinatorial proof. Anyway, here is my dilemma: For fixed $n$ and $k,$ the second expression is greater than or equal to the first expression. This just seems weird to me because the second expression involves the binomial coefficients of the row above the row in which the binomial coefficients of the first expression lie in Pascal's triangle. I would have expected it to be the other way around. It seems that the alternating signs somehow produce this counterintuitive result, which I have proven but have been unable to fathom. Is there an explanation for this? Is the inequality resulting from saying the second expression is greater than or equal to the first expression evident in some larger theorem or context? As a side note, I was also wondering if this is in some way connected to the Bonferroni inequalities. This is just something I was musing about, inspired by the similarity in form and context, but I'm not too hopeful about it as the stated formulas have binomial coefficients, which Bonferroni does not.","['combinatorial-proofs', 'matrices', 'inclusion-exclusion', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"
3676766,Explain step in Galindo and Pascual (Quantum Mechanics I) proof of self-adjointness of the momentum operator in QM,"In the book Quantum Mechanics (Volume I) by Galindo & Pascual, they define the domain of the QM momentum operator on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}=L^2(\mathbb{R})$ as \begin{equation*}
  D(P)=\Biggl\{\psi\in\mathcal{H}: \psi\text{ absolutely continuous,}
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty\!dx\,\Biggl\lvert\frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\Biggr\rvert^2<\infty\Biggr\}
\end{equation*} and the momentum operator $P$ by $$(P\psi)(x)=-i\frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}.$$ They go on to prove that $P$ is densely defined and symmetric. To prove that $P$ is self-adjoint, they attempt to show that $D(P^\dagger)\subseteq D(P)$ . Here are the next couple of lines of the proof: ... consider a function $\psi\in D(P^\dagger)$ and define $\psi_1=P^\dagger\psi$ ; then $$\langle\psi|P|\varphi\rangle=\langle\psi_1|\varphi\rangle,\quad\forall\varphi\in D(P)$$ can be rewritten as \begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \langle\psi|P|\varphi\rangle
    &=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\!dx\,\psi_1^*(x)\varphi(x)\\
    &=i\int_{-\infty}^\infty\!dx\Biggl[\frac{d}{dx}
    \Biggl(i\int_0^x\!dt\,\psi_1(t)+c\Biggr)^*\Biggr]\varphi(x),
  \end{split}
\end{equation*} where $c$ is an arbitrary constant. Choosing $\varphi\in C^\infty_0$ , integrating by parts,
and taking into account that $\varphi$ is zero outside a finite interval, we obtain \begin{equation}\tag{2.16}
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty\!dx\Biggl(\psi(x)-i\int_0^x\!dt\,\psi_1(t)-c\Biggr)^*
  \Biggl(-i\frac{d\varphi(x)}{dx}\Biggr)=0,\quad\forall\varphi\in C^\infty_0.
\end{equation} [So far, this seems OK to me. It is the next statement that I don't follow:] Since $C^\infty_0$ is dense in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ , the first factor of the integrand
in (2.16) must be a constant and hence, with a convenient choice $c_0$ for $c$ , we can write
almost everywhere \begin{equation}\tag{2.17}
  \psi(x)=c_0+i\int_0^x\!dt\,\psi_1(t),
\end{equation} [and it goes on from there] I want to concentrate on the validity of going from (2.16) to (2.17). I understand that,
with total lack of rigor, if we have $$\int h\varphi'=0\quad\forall\varphi\in C^\infty_0$$ we'd like to do an integration by parts and write $$\int h'\varphi=\int h\varphi'=0\quad\forall\varphi\in C^\infty_0$$ from which we would get that $h'=0$ almost everywhere hence $h=c$ almost everywhere.
But I don't see how to apply that here since I don't know that $\psi$ is differentiable a.e.
or even a.e. on a compact interval. It even looks like a version of the DuBois-Raymond theorem from variational calculus, but I only know that for continuous functions on a compact interval, so it would seem to not apply here. So, my questions are: how do you get from (2.16) to (2.17)? what element of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ would they be talking about when they say that $C^\infty_0$ is dense in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ ?","['hilbert-spaces', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-integral', 'functional-analysis']"

3676810,How do inverse functions exist for exponential functions?,"I know that they exist for exponential functions (we currently have them in class), but to me it doesn't seem ""reasonable"" when I look at the definition of what an inverse function is.
The inverse is defined as a function where you can swap $x$ and $y$ , then solve for $y$ and the notation being $\operatorname{f^{-1}}(x)$ . Since functions are a 1 to 1 mapping this can only be true for some functions. In the textbook we use we have following definition for the domain of functions/inverse functions: $$\mathbb{D}_{f} = \mathbb{W}_{f^{-1}} \rightleftharpoons \mathbb{W}_{f} = \mathbb{D}_{f^{-1}}$$ I also get that some functions don't have inverses or where they only exist for a restricted domain (like $x^2$ where you have to restrict the domain, or some functions where you can't solve for $x$ ). The thing about as example $2^x$ that puts me off is that the input domain $\mathbb{D}$ consists out of all real numbers, whereas the output is made out of positive real numbers only. How can there be a 1 to 1 mapping if the output consists only out of positive real numbers, aren't there less positive real numbers than real numbers? With as example $x^3$ you use up all $x$ and $y$ values, so it having a valid inverse makes intuitive sense to me. We get taught about how important the uniqueness of the mapping between $x$ and $y$ is, but it just feels wrong for exponential functions. Can anyone provide me a pointer to as where I start thinking about this wrongly? I have solved all the problems in our book and on the additional sheet the teacher gave us and have only had a few mistakes (which probably came from lack of sleep). Understanding the composition of functions was pretty easy for me as well, thanks to knowing higher order functions. I'm really sure I'm misunderstanding something elementary the wrong way.","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions']"
3676815,Is a homogeneous Banach space on $\mathbb T$ always well defined?,"A homogeneous Banach space $B$ on group $\mathbb T=\mathbb R/2\pi\mathbb Z$ is a linear subspace $B$ of $L^1(\mathbb T)$ having a norm $\|\ \|_B\ge\|\ \|_{L^1}$ under which it is a Banach space, and having the following properties: If $f\in B$ and $\tau\in\mathbb T$ , then $f_\tau\in B$ and $\|f_\tau\|_B=\|f\|_B$ (where $f_\tau=f(t-\tau)$ ). For all $f\in B\quad $ , $\tau, \tau_0\in\mathbb T,\quad $$\lim_{\tau\to\tau_0}\|f_\tau-f_{\tau_0}\|=0.$ I am wondering whether this is well-defined. For instance, if we have $f_1,f_2\in B\subseteq L^1(\mathbb T)$ and $f_1=f_2$ in $L^1(\mathbb T)$ , then the values of $f_1$ and $f_2$ differ at most at a zero measure set. But it is also possible that $f_1\ne f_2$ in $B$ and in which case, it does not make sense to say the $B$ -norm of $f_1$ or $f_2$ since they are considered to be one element in $L^1(\mathbb T)$ and also in the subspace $B$ of $L^1(\mathbb T)$ .

3676830,Why do we use this complicated algorithm for finding values of trigonometric functions?,"My Mathematics Textbook covers the topic of Values of Trigonometric Functions at Allied Angles using some general formulae first and then goes on to the topic of finding the values of trigonometric functions at allied angles using an algorithm . The cases discussed in finding the values using some general formulae are : At $(-x)$ At $\Big (\dfrac{\pi}{2} \pm x \Big )$ At $(\pi \pm x)$ At $\Big ( \dfrac {3\pi}{2} \pm x \Big )$ At $(2\pi \pm x)$ which can also be written as $(\pm $ $x)$ The algorithm is as follows : Let the angle be $x$ If $x<0$ and $x = (-a)$ , continue with the further steps as $a$ in place of $x$ and when the final result arrives : if $f$ is an even function, then $f(x) = f(-x)$ , so $f(x) = f(a)$ and if $f$ is an odd function, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ , so $f(x) = -f(-x) = -f(a)$ Express $x$ (or $a$ ) in the form of $\dfrac {n\pi}{2} \pm \alpha$ , where $0<\alpha<\dfrac{\pi}{2}$ or $\alpha \in \Big (0, \dfrac {\pi}{2} \Big )$ If $n$ is odd, then $\sin x = \pm \cos \alpha$ , $\cos x = \pm \sin \alpha$ , $\tan x = \pm \cot \alpha$ , $\cot x = \pm \tan \alpha$ , $\sec x = \pm \csc \alpha$ and $\csc x = \pm \sec \alpha$ If $n$ is even, then $\sin x = \pm \sin \alpha$ , $\cos x = \pm \cos \alpha$ , $\tan x = \pm \tan \alpha$ , $\cot x = \pm \cot \alpha$ , $\sec x = \pm \sec \alpha$ and $\csc x = \pm \csc \alpha$ Determine the quadrant that $x$ lies in and then decide the sign of the value Let's take an example : Find the value of $\sin \dfrac{7\pi}{4}$ . One method to do this will be using the first method. $\sin \dfrac{7\pi}{4} = \sin \Big (2\pi - \dfrac{\pi}{4} \Big )$ We know that $\sin (2\pi-x)=(-\sin x)$ . So, $\sin \Big (2\pi - \dfrac{\pi}{4} \Big ) = \Big ( -\sin \dfrac {\pi}{4} \Big ) = -\dfrac {1}{\sqrt{2}}$ Another method would be to use the algorithm $\dfrac{7\pi}{4}=\dfrac{3\pi}{2}+\dfrac{\pi}{4}$ , so $\dfrac {3\pi}{2} < \dfrac{7\pi}{4} < 2\pi$ and $\dfrac{7\pi}{4}$ lies in the $IV$ quadrant, which means that $\sin \dfrac{7\pi}{4} < 0$ Now, $\dfrac{7\pi}{4} = \dfrac {3.\pi}{2} + \dfrac{\pi}{4}$ . $3$ is odd, so $\sin \dfrac{7\pi}{4} = -\sin \dfrac {\pi}{4} = -\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ Now, this algorithm seems like something extremely complex for solving simple questions like these. So, why do we use this algorithm when we can just use the simple formulae that help us find the values of trigonometric functions at allied angles? Are there some advantageous applications of this algorithm?

3677207,"Functions of the form $\int_{a} ^{x} f(t) \, dt$ with regard to Riemann and Lebesgue integral","Consider the class $\mathcal{R}[a, b] $ of functions $F:[a, b] \to\mathbb {R} $ which can be expressed as $$F(x) =\int_{a} ^{x} f(t) \, dt$$ for some Riemann integrable function $f$ and consider similar class $\mathcal{L}[a, b] $ of functions where the integral is Lebesgue instead of Riemann. Since Riemann integrable functions are also Lebesgue integrable $\mathcal{R} [a, b] \subseteq \mathcal{L} [a, b] $ . I suspect these sets are not equal. Further it is known that the functions in $\mathcal{L}[a, b] $ are characterized by the following properties: They are continuous on $[a, b] $ They are of bounded variation on $[a, b] $ They satisfy Luzin N property on $[a, b] $ ie if $A\subseteq[a, b] $ is a set of measure zero then $F(A) $ is also a set of measure zero. Clearly these properties are also possessed by the functions $F\in\mathcal {R} [a, b] $ but since this is supposed to be a smaller set compared to $\mathcal{L} [a, b] $ its members must have some other unique properties not possessed by members of $\mathcal{L} [a, b] $ . How can we characterize the members of $\mathcal{R} [a, b] $ ? Any specific examples will help to illustrate the properties involved. The motivation for this question comes from the fact the Lebesgue integrable functions can be much weirder (eg discontinuous everywhere) than Riemann integrable functions (necessarily continuous almost everywhere) and yet their integrals are far more well behaved (continuous and of bounded variation). A weird function like Dirichlet characteristic function of rationals upon integrating gives the constant function $0$ . I think that finding functions which lie in $\mathcal{L} $ and not in $\mathcal{R} $ is not trivial. I also tried to apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Riemann integrals and figured that the functions in $\mathcal{R} $ are differentiable almost everywhere, but due to bounded variation the same holds for functions in $\mathcal{L} $ also. The difference between these two classes is a bit deep and not easy to figure out at least for me.","['riemann-integration', 'lebesgue-integral', 'real-analysis']"
3677220,Convert Complex to Trigonometric.,"How do we convert $me^{ik}+ne^{-ik}$ to a purely trigonometric expression? I am guessing it has something to do with $e^{it}=\cos(t)+i\sin(t)$ but I can't figure out exactly how. Edit:- I should have been clearer. In particular, I was looking for how to convert the above to $A\cos(k+x)$ where $x$ and $A$ are constants. Edit 2:- Here is what I have achieved so far. $me^{ik}+ne^{-ik}\\$ $=m(\cos(k)+i\sin(k))+n(\cos(-k)+i\sin(-k))\\$ $=m(\cos(k)+i\sin(k))+n(\cos(k)-i\sin(k))\\$ $=\cos(k)(m+n)+i\sin(k)(m-n)\\$ Now what?","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry', 'complex-numbers']"

$$ I like it because it's nice and directly conveys the matrix representation. However, someone mentioned to me that these representations are good for notes and teaching materials but not for publications. In this specific example the matrix is a diagonal matrix, but I am asking more in general, if you have to convey an arbitrary matrix with any dimensions and any entries, how do you convey the pattern in the matrix without doing dot notation?","['matrices', 'notation', 'linear-algebra']"
3677279,Finding $\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\frac{\sqrt{n^2+n}-1}{n}\right)^{2\sqrt{n^2+n}-1}$,"Find the following limit without using the L'Hopital rule: $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\dfrac{\sqrt{n^2+n}-1}{n}\right)^{2\sqrt{n^2+n}-1}$$ Answer: $e^{-1}$ My attempt: Since the limit is of the form $1^{\infty}$ , I decided to use the standard formula: $$\lim_{x\to a} f^g = e^{\lim_\limits{x\to a}(f-1)g}$$ (See link ) Let $l=(f-1)g$ . We have, $$l=\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{n^2+n}-(1+n)}{n}\right)(2\sqrt{n^2+n}-1)$$ This on solving boils down to $$l=2n+3-\sqrt{1+\frac 1n}(2n+3)+\frac 1n$$ Now if I tend $n$ towards infinity, then $l\to 0$ and the limit i.e. $e^l$ , is equal to $1$ , which contradicts the given answer. Please help. Thanks! Edit: 
A proof for the ""standard formula"" I have used. Edit 2: just noticed a typo in the power which I have now fixed.","['limits', 'calculus', 'limits-without-lhopital']"
3677292,"Evaluate $\sum_{n,k} \binom{n}{k}^{-1} $","Evaluate $$\sum_{n,k}  \frac{1}{\binom{n}{k}}, $$ where the summation ranges over all positive integers $n,k$ with $1<k<n-1$ . Thouhgts: We are trying to evaluate $$\sum_{n=4}^{\infty} \sum_{k=2}^{n-2} \binom{n}{k}^{-1}$$ We may try to find a closed form of the inner summation which is of the form : $$ \frac{1}{ {n \choose 2} } +  \frac{1}{{n \choose 3} }+ \dotsb + \frac{1}{{n \choose n-2} }.   $$ Notice that we may write $\frac{1}{ {n \choose 2} } = \frac{2! }{n(n-1)}$ and if keep doing the same for the other terms we obtain the following: $$ \frac{ (n-2)! + (n-3)! (n-(n-2)) + (n-4)!(n-(n-2))(n-(n-3)) + \dotsb + 2! (n-3)! }{n!}, $$ which equals $$ \frac{ (n-2)! + 2!(n-3)! + 3! (n-4)! + \dotsb + (n-3)! 2! }{n!} $$ and so this equals: $$ \frac{1}{n(n-1)} + \frac{2}{n(n-1)(n-2)} + \dfrac{6}{n(n-1)(n-2)} + \dotsb + \dfrac{2}{n(n-1)(n-2) }. $$ But half of this terms are identical. Therefore, we are trying to sum up series of the form $$\sum_{n \geq k} \frac{1}{(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)\dotso(n-k)} ,$$ which can be done by a telescoping trick, but it seems very formidable. Am I approaching this problem the right way? Any hints/suggestions?","['calculus', 'sequences-and-series', 'summation', 'real-analysis']"
3677305,Are Christoffel symbols associated with a tensor object?,"First of all, my question lies on: Differentiable, real, n-dimensional Manifolds and in the context of differential geometry for General Relativity. Also, my level of academic mathematical language do not cover fibre bundles or more complex structures than the intuitive notion of tangent and cotangent bundles. So, the author in $[1]$ said explicitly the following stroked in red: Then, the whole well-know fact that Christoffel symbols aren't tensors has sinked into a whirlpool of confusion. This whirlpool of confusion is due to the classical tensor analysis realization; which we check that the christoffel symbols in fact do not transform like a tensor object. Furthermore other authors have pointed out this fact of a true tensor nature, of the Christoffel symbols, before: $[2]$ , $[3]$ . The thing is, if they form a components of a $(1,1)-tensor$ $[1]$ , then there must to be such abstract object which is the ""pure"" tensor: $$\Gamma = \Gamma^{a}_{b} dx^{b} \otimes \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{a}} \tag{1}$$ Well, the fact is, concerning the realization of $[1]$ when he said: one for each basis vector $\vec{e}_{\nu}$ this motivated me to write a notation for this phrase: $$ \Gamma^{a}_{(\cdot)b} \tag{2}$$ Where the dot means that, when we put a basis vector $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{j}}$ we get on return $[2]$ : $$ \Gamma^{a}_{(\cdot)b}\Big(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{j}}\Big)\equiv \Gamma^{a}_{jb} =: dx^{a}\Big( \nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{b}}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{j}} \Big) \tag{3}$$ On the other hand, a mathematical fact is that, a Christoffel Symbol can be calculated precisely as $(3)$ .
So, if we omit the basis vector $j$ , then we have, in fact, an operator: $$\Gamma^{a}_{(\cdot)b}: \mathfrak{X}(M) \to C^{\infty}(M)  $$ $$ \Gamma^{a}_{(\cdot)b}=: dx^{a}\Big( \nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{b}}} (\cdot)\Big) \tag{4}$$ Or, more gently: $$\Gamma^{a}_{(\cdot)b}: T_{p}M \to \mathbb{R}  $$ . Now, for the tensor transformation law I tried to prove and I get, nicely, a result which is the true tensor law: Consider then the symbols in a coordinate chart $C'$ . $$ \Gamma'^{a'}_{(\cdot)b'} = \Gamma'^{a'}_{b'} \tag{5}$$ Where in $(5)$ is just a change of notation. Then we perfom a change of coordinates to another chart $C \to C'$ Then the Symbols transforms as: $$\Gamma'^{a'}_{b'} = dx'^{a'}\Big( \nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x'^{b'}}} (\cdot)\Big)  = \frac{\partial x'^{a'}}{\partial x^{c}}dx^{c}\Bigg( \nabla_{\frac{\partial x^{d}}{\partial x^{b'}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{d}}} (\cdot)\Bigg) = $$ $$ = \frac{\partial x'^{a'}}{\partial x^{c}}\frac{\partial x^{d}}{\partial x^{b'}}dx^{c}\Bigg( \nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{d}}} (\cdot)\Bigg) =\frac{\partial x'^{a'}}{\partial x^{c}}\frac{\partial x^{d}}{\partial x^{b'}} \Gamma^{c}_{d}  \tag{6} $$ So indeed the symbols transforms like a tensor, then with an abuse of notation, we can say that ""Christoffel symbols"" transforms like a tensor. The subtle fact is: for every basis vector we have an Christoffel Symbols; therefore the whole symbol $(3)$ do not transform indeed. But since we have the $\Gamma^{a}_{b}$ , and it's tensor nature, we can therefore say that they form components of the Christoffel Tensor . Then, we can indeed conclude it's abstract form $(1)$ . My question is: Is the tensor law expressed in $(6)$ totally correct? Or, in other words, the operator realization given by $(4)$ makes sense? $$ * * * $$ $[1]$ BERTSCHINGER.B.
