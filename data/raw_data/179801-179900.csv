3268364,Expansion of the Mittag-Leffler function $E_{s}(x^{s})$,"I want to find an expansion of the Mittag-Leffler function $E_{s}(x^{s})$ of the form : $$E_{s}(x^{s})=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f_{n}(x)g_{n}(s)\;\;\;\;\;(\Im(x)=\Im(s)=0)$$ I first defind the function $\Omega(x,s)$ : $$\Omega(x,s)=sE_{s}(x^{s})-s-(e^{x}-1)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{x^{ns}}{n\Gamma(ns)}-\frac{x^{n}}{n!}$$ The reason for the introduction of the term $e^{x}-1$ is to extend the domain of convergence of the Laplace transform of $\Omega(x,s)$ , which is given by : $$\int_{0}^{\infty}\Omega(x,s)e^{-zx}dx=\frac{s}{z(z^{s}-1)}-\frac{1}{z(z-1)}$$ Applying the Bromwich inversion formula, we obtain : $$\Omega(x,s)=\frac{1}{2\pi i }\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\left[\frac{s}{z(z^{s}-1)}-\frac{1}{z(z-1)}

Using the fact that : $$e^{x(e^{y}-1)}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\phi_{n}(x)}{n!}y^{n}$$ $\phi_{n}(x)$ being the nth order Bell polynomial We obtain : $$\Omega(x,s)=\frac{1}{2\pi i }\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{e^{x}\phi_{n}(x)}{n!}\int_{\Gamma}\left(\frac{s}{e^{sy}-1}-\frac{1}{e^{y}-1} \right )y^{n}dy

3268535,Does the Riemannian metric induced by a diffeomorphism $F$ exist for a reason other than the existence of vector field pushforwards?,"My book is Connections, Curvature, and Characteristic Classes by Loring W. Tu (I'll call this Volume 3), a sequel to both Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology by Loring W. Tu and Raoul Bott (Volume 2) and An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring W. Tu (Volume 1). Definition 1.5 gives the definition for Riemannian metric and Riemannian manifold. Example 1.9 says If $F : N \to M$ is a diffeomorphism and $< , >$ is a Riemannian metric on $M$ , then (1.3) defines an induced Riemannian metric $< , >'$ on $N$ . Here $N$ and $M$ are smooth manifolds that hopefully have dimensions . Note that the $F_*$ here indeed refers to the differential $F_*,p: T_pN \to T_{F(p)}M$ defined in Volume 1 Section 8.2 and not the latter half $F_*: TN \to TM$ of the bundle map $(F, F_*)$ , where $F_*$ is what would be known as $\tilde{F}$ in Volume 1 Section 12.3 . The following is my proof of Example 1.9 . Question 1: Is this proof correct? Question 2: If this proof is correct , then is there a way to do this without relying on pushforwards from Volume 1 or without injectivity of $F$ ? I guess we can come up with a similar proof for an embedding, but embeddings are injective. So we'll have to go with investigating local diffeomorphisms, local diffeomorphisms onto image, immersions, etc. I'm asking because the Example 1.10 seems to do similarly to Example 1.9 though the $F$ in Example 1.10 is not injective. If this proof is incorrect , then why? Proof: Notation from Volume 1 Section 2.4 : For a smooth manifold $N$ , let $\mathfrak X (N)$ be the set of smooth vector fields on $N$ , and let $C^{\infty}N$ be the set of smooth functions on $N$ (not germs ). We must show that A. (Not interested in proving this part, but I'm stating what is to be proven for completeness) For all $p \in N$ , the mapping $\langle , \rangle'_p: (T_pN)^2 \to \mathbb R$ is an inner product on $T_pN$ , where $\langle , \rangle'_p$ is given as follows: Let $u,v \in T_pN$ . Then $F_{*,p}u, F_{*,p}v \in T_{F(p)}M$ . Let $\langle , \rangle_{F(p)}: (T_{F(p)}M)^2 \to \mathbb R$ be the inner product on $T_{F(p)}M$ given by the Riemannian metric $\langle , \rangle$ on $M$ , at the point $F(p) \in M$ . Then $(\langle , \rangle'_p)(u,v) = \langle u, v \rangle'_p = \langle F_{*,p}u, F_{*,p}v \rangle_{F(p)}$ . B. $\langle X,Y\rangle' \in C^{\infty}N$ for all $X,Y \in \mathfrak X (N)$ , where $\langle X,Y\rangle': N \to \mathbb R$ , $\langle X,Y \rangle'(p)=\langle X_p,Y_p\rangle'_p$ $=\langle F_{*,p}X_p,F_{*,p}Y_p\rangle_{F(p)}$ . To prove B: Let $X,Y \in \mathfrak X (N)$ . Then, by Volume 1 Example 14.15 , $F_{*}X$ and $F_{*}Y$ are defined vector fields on $M$ . Hopefully, $F_{*}X$ and $F_{*}Y$ are smooth, i.e. $F_{*}X,F_{*}Y \in \mathfrak X (M)$ .

3268542,Pushfoward of smooth vector field is smooth?,"My books are Connections, Curvature, and Characteristic Classes by Loring W. Tu (I'll call this Volume 3), Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology by Loring W. Tu and Raoul Bott (Volume 2) and An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring W. Tu (Volume 1). Let $F : N \to M$ be a diffeomorphism of manifolds that have dimensions . Let $X$ be a smooth vector field on $N$ . Then the pushforward $F_*X$ is a defined vector field on $M$ by Volume 1 Example 14.15 Is $F_*X: M \to TM$ smooth? This is a step of a proof in another question . I think $F_*X$ is smooth because: 1.1. Let $F_{*,p}: T_pN \to T_{F(p)}M$ be the differential of $F$ at $p$ , defined in Volume 1 Section 8.2 . 1.2. Let $F_*: TN \to TM$ be the map given by $F_*(X_p) = F_{*,p}(X_p)$ . I think $F_*$ is the same as what would be known as $\tilde{F}$ in Volume 1 Section 12.3 . 1.3. $F_*X: M \to TM$ is actually $F_*X: M \to N \to TN \to TM$ , $F_*X = F_* \circ X \circ F^{-1}$ 1.4. $F_*$ is smooth because $F_*$ is a smooth embedding by this because $F$ is a smooth embedding (Hopefully the definitions there are the same as in Volume 1 Definition 11.11 ). Note: We might say $F_*$ is smooth by some other route. I ask about the other routes here . Note: I'm not sure Volume 1 Section 12.3 explicitly says $F_*$ , also known as $\tilde{F}$ , is smooth. (I think this might be proved in Volume 2, but I actually stopped Volume 2 at Section 6, and I did not study Sections 1-6 in too much detail because I noticed Volume 2 is not really a prerequisite of Volume 3 and because I was hoping to learn more of vector bundles from Volume 3 before continuing Volume 2.) 1.5 Therefore, $F_*X$ is smooth by (1.3), (1.4), smoothness of $F^{-1}$ , smoothness of $X$ and Volume 1 Proposition 6.9 . What can $F$ alternatively be if not a diffeomorphism for $F_*X$ to be smooth? Some guide questions: 2.1. Must $F$ be injective (and smooth) for $F_*X$ to be defined in the first place? (Answer must be the opposite of the answer of 2.2, I think.) 2.2. Can $F$ be a local diffeomorphism (defined in Volume 1 Section 6.7 and further described in Volume 1 Remark 8.12 )? 2.2.1 Can $F$ be a local diffeomorphism onto its image ? (I guess that $F$ is a local diffeomorphism onto its image is defined as that $F$ with restricted range, $\tilde F: N \to F(N)$ is a local diffeomorphism. I actually don't know and haven't yet thought of the relationship between $F$ local diffeo and $F$ local diffeo onto image) 2.3. Can $F$ be a smooth embedding (defined in Volume 1 Definition 11.11 )? I think yes because we would still have that $F_*X$ defined by $F$ 's injectivity and that $F_*$ smooth by this . The problem might be the $F^{-1}$ , but I think that's not too difficult to fix. Update: Indeed not a difficult (maybe) fix. Just use $\tilde F ^{-1}$ for $\tilde F: N \to F(N)$ . The fix is complete when we show $\tilde F ^{-1}$ is smooth. This may be by your definition of smooth embedding (not difficult) or by a property of your definition of smooth embedding (difficulty depends on your understanding of the proof of the property).","['vector-fields', 'manifolds', 'general-topology', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
3268544,Taylor polynomials respect derivatives,"I want to prove that the derivative of the $n$ th order Taylor polynomial is the $n-1$ th order Taylor polynomial of the derivative. More specifically: Suppose $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is $n$ times differentiable about $x_0$ and $T_n(x)$ a polynomail of degree at most $n$ .
Then if $$
\lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{f(x) - T_n(x)}{(x-x_0)^n}

\lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{f'(x) - T'_n(x)}{(x-x_0)^{n-1}}

$$ $\textbf{I am looking for a proof of this fact that is as direct as possible}$ . The fact looks like a simple corollary of l'hopitals rule. However I don't think this is legitimate since l'hopitals rule assumes that the limit $\frac{f'}{g'}$ exists, and this is what we are trying to prove. I think this property should be true by the following argument:
The hypothesis implies $T_n(x)$ is the $n$ th order Taylor polynomial of $f$ about $x_0$ .
Hence $$
T_n(x)
= \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}(x-x_0)^k.
$$ This implies $$T'_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{f^{(k+1)}(x_0)}{k!}(x-x_0)^k = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{g^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}(x-x_0)^k$$ where $g(x) = f'(x)$ . Hence $T'_n(x)$ is the $n-1$ th order Taylor polynomial of $g(x) = f'(x)$ . Again it is well known that this implies $$\lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{f'(x) - T'_n(x)}{(x-x_0)^{n-1}} = 0$$","['taylor-expansion', 'limits', 'calculus', 'polynomials']"

After receiving a hint from @StubbornAtom and doing some more reading, here my attempt to solve this problem.
Since our hypothesis test is a simple hypothesis test we can use Neymann-Pearson Lemma, which states the LRT is the UMP of such hypothesis tests. We let $\lambda(x)=\frac{f_1(x)}{f_0(x)}$ and we reject $H_0$ if $\lambda(x)>k$ . In our case the LRT is as follows: $\frac{f_1(1)}{f_0(1)}=3/2$ , $\frac{f_1(2)}{f_0(2)}=1/3$ , $\frac{f_1(3)}{f_0(3)}=3$ , $\frac{f_1(5)}{f_0(5)}=2/3$ , $\frac{f_1(7)}{f_0(7)}=1$ . From here we see that the greatest value of the LRT is $3$ and it happens when $x=3$ . Therefore, our critical region is $\{x=3\}$ . Thus, we reject $H_0$ if $X = 3$ . The significance of this test $\alpha=P(\text{reject } H_0\mid H_0)=P(X=3\mid f_0)=0.1$ . But we need it to be 0.3 I would appreciate a thumbs up or down for my attempt to solve this problem.

3268870,Proving a certain type of topology is discrete without the axiom of choice,"I came across the following exercise: suppose we have a topology on an infinite set $X$ which contains all infinite subsets of $X$ . Prove that the topology is discrete. Here's a way to approach this: pick two disjoint infinite subsets $A$ and $B$ of $X$ . For any $x\in X$ , $A\cup\left\{x\right\}$ and $B\cup\left\{x\right\}$ are open and so is their intersection, which is just $\left\{x\right\}$ . Hence all singletons are open and the topology is discrete. This proof is essentially the same as the one here . However, I don't quite like this argument, mainly because of the step where we say ""pick two disjoint infinite subsets of $X$ "". This isn't really a problem in ZFC since it's possible to prove that every infinite set has an infinite countable subset and after this is established, picking $A$ and $B$ is simple. But what if I'm working without the axiom of choice?

3268895,"A distance over strings, and an embedding that perfectly captures it","Suppose we have an alphabet $\Sigma$ . We also define a set of operations on a string $s=s_1 s_2 \dots s_n\in\Sigma^\star$ (assuming $c\in\Sigma, i\in[n]$ : $$swap(s,i)=s_1 \dots s_{i-1} s_{i+1}s_{i} s_{i+2} \dots s_n$$ $$ins(s,i,c) = s_1 s_2 \dots s_{i-1}\; c \;s_i \dots s_n$$ $$del(s,i) = s_1 s_2 \dots s_{i-1} s_{i+1} \dots s_n$$ Moreover the costs associated with each operation is defined as: $$C_{swap(s,i)} = 2, C_{ins(s,i,c)} = |s|, C_{del(s,i)} = |s|-1$$ Now if we denote the space of all possible actions by $\mathcal{A}$ , we define the distance between two strings as the minimum cost set of operations that transform one string to antoher: $$d(s,s')=\min_{a_i\in\mathcal{A}, a_k(\dots a_2(a_1(s))\dots) = s'} \sum_{i} C_{a_i}$$ It is easy to see that the distance is symmetric, as any operation can be reversed with the same cost: $s'=swap(s,i)\rightarrow s=swap(s',i)$ , $s'=ins(s,i,c) \rightarrow s=del(s',i)$ and $s'=del(s,i) \rightarrow s=ins(s',i,s_i)$ , while the cost remains the same. Therefore any minimum cost list of operations could be reversed to prove $d(s,s') = d(s',s)$ . However, I have a guess that the distances have a very simple formula which is as follows:

Or formally: $$v_s(a,b) = \#\{(i,j) \colon i<j, s_i=a, s_j=b\}$$ My guess is that: $$d(s,s') = \sum_{a,b\in\Sigma} |v_s(a,b)-v_{s'}(a,b)| \qquad (1)$$ If this is true, another way to view it is that we can embed strings into a $|\Sigma|^2$ dimensional space $s\in\Sigma^\star\rightarrow v_s\in \mathbb{N}^{|\Sigma|^2}$ , such that the $L_1$ distance in the embedding space corresponds exactly to the distance defined over strings: $d(s,s') = ||v_s - v_{s'}||_1$ (if we view $v_s,v_{s'}$ as vectors). It is easy to see that if we get $s'$ from $s$ by a single operation, the associated cost is captured by the equation (1). But in order to prove that for any set of optimal operations the equation holds some kind of induction must be used. But I am not sure how to construct such an induction.

3268930,"Nakayama's Lemma, Stalks and Fibres (Hartshorne III.12.7.2)","I can't quite follow Chapter III, Example 12.7.2 in Hartshorne (I've written it in the case of affine varieties only here since I haven't worked with schemes in general yet and this is all I need). In it, he gives an alternative proof of a result I asked about in this question . Let $X$ be an affine variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ , $A=\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ , and $\mathcal{F}$ a coherent sheaf on $X$ . Let $x\in X$ , $\mathfrak{m}_x=\{f\in A\mid f(x)=0\}$ , and $k(x)=A/\mathfrak{m}_x$ . Then the function $$\varphi(x)=\dim_{k(x)}(\mathcal{F}\otimes_A k(x))$$ is upper semi-continuous. I'll go through his reasoning and my thoughts so far. Since $\mathcal{F}$ is coherent, I have taken an $A$ -module $M$ with $\mathcal{F}=\widetilde{M}$ . He starts by saying that by Nakayama's Lemma we have that $\varphi(x)$ is the minimum number of generators of the stalk $\mathcal{F}_x$ as an $\mathcal{O}_x$ -module. Here is my attempt to justify this: Suppose $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ generate $\mathcal{F}_x=M_{\mathfrak{m}_x}$ as an $\mathcal{O}_x=A_{\mathfrak{m}_x}$ module, with $n$ minimal. Then for any $m\in\mathcal{F}_x$ we can find $a_i\in A$ , $f\in A\setminus\mathfrak{m}_x$ such that $$m=\frac{a_1}{f}x_1+\cdots+\frac{a_n}{f}x_n$$ (we can assume a common denominator by taking terms into the $a_i$ ). Since $k(x)$ is a field we can find $g\in A$ with $fg-1\in\mathfrak{m}_x$ . Then for $b_i=a_ig$ we have $m=b_1x_1+\cdots+b_nx_n$ in $\mathcal{F}\otimes_A k(x)=M/\mathfrak{m}_xM$ and so $\varphi(x)\leq n$ . Conversely, suppose that $\varphi(x)=l$ and $x_1,\ldots,x_l$ generate $\mathcal{F}\otimes_A k(x)$ over $k(x)$ . Now, $\mathcal{F}\otimes_A k(x)=\mathcal{F}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x\mathcal{F}_x$ , so by Nakayama's Lemma there exists some $f\in A\setminus\mathfrak{m}_x$ such that the $x_i$ generate $(M_{\mathfrak{m}_x})_f$ as an $A_f$ -module. But $(M_{\mathfrak{m}_x})_f=M_{\mathfrak{m}_x}$ since $f\notin\mathfrak{m}_x$ , and $A_f\subseteq A_{\mathfrak{m}_x}$ , so they certainly generate $\mathcal{F}_x$ as an $\mathcal{O}_x$ -module. Then $n\leq\varphi(x)$ , so $\varphi(x)=n$ as desired. He goes on to say that if $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ form a minimal set of generators, then they generate $\mathcal{F}$ in some neighbourhood. From my justification of the first statement, it appears that this neighbourhood would be $D(f)$ . We know they generate $M_{\mathfrak{m}_x}$ as an $A_f$ -module, but I'm not sure how this would show they generate $M_f$ . I also can't see why we would need to use the minimum number of generators for this step in particular to be true. He concludes that if we take any $y$ in this neighbourhood, then $\varphi(y)\leq n$ . This is where I am particularly confused. As I understand it (and I may well have already misunderstood something), we would (hopefully) have that $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ generate $M_f$ as an $A_f$ -module, with $y\in D(f)$ . Then why does this imply that we can generate $\mathcal{F}_y=M_{\mathfrak{m}_y}$ as an $\mathcal{O}_y=A_{\mathfrak{m}_y}$ module using $n$ elements? Perhaps I'm not using Nakayama's Lemma in the way he intended, my justification seems very laboured in comparison to how it is presented, so I feel I'm really missing something here.

3269080,"How can you mathematically define a ""wobbly"" function?","There are a lot of functions that look wobbly. For example $x^4 + x^3$ looks a little wobbly when it gets near the x axis. The function $\sin(x)$ is extremely wobbly. The function $\sin(x) + x$ is also extremely wobbly. What is a mathematical expression that seems to calculate how ""wobbly"" a function $f(x)$ is? What I've done so far: At first I thought ""wobbly"" was just the slope changing quickly. To measure how fast the slope is changing, that would be the slope of the slope, and we don't care about direction, so we obtain: $$w_1(f; a, b) = \int_a^b | f''(x) | dx$$ where $w_1$ is the first definition I've come up with for the ""wobbliness"" of a function from $x = a$ to $x = b$ where $a < b$ . However, when I tested this on the function $f_1(x) = x^4 + x^3 - x^2 - x$ , it didn't seem right. $f_1$ seems to be wobbly from $-1$ to $1$ . However, $w_1(f_1) = \int_a^b |12x^2+6x-2|$ which seems to be largest for $a, b < -1$ or $1 < a, b$ , which is not what we want. My next thought was that maybe I'm counting how often a function is switching from a non-zero slope to a zero slope over a particular range. This would make $f_1$ be wobbly from $-1$ to $1$ , and would also make $\sin(x)$ be very wobbly as well. However, I didn't even attempt to come up with a mathematical formula for this definition (which I will call $w_2$ ), because I recognized that $f_2 = \sin(x) + 2x$ would be a counterexample. It's also very wobbly, but its slope is never 0. Interestingly enough, $w_1$ seems to do a good job of measuring where $f_2$ is wobbly. So, again, what mathematical function can be used to quantify how ""wobbly"" another function is? (It must work for at least $f_1$ and $f_2$ and hopefully generalize to other functions as well.) Here are graphs of $f_1$ , $f_2$ , $w_1(f_1)$ , and $w_1(f_2)$ in case they are helpful for understanding.","['definition', 'functions', 'visualization', 'terminology']"

Inner product on $\mathcal{S}$ is given by $\langle A , B \rangle =  trace(A B)$ . $\mathcal{P}$ is an open set in $\mathcal{S}$ . the map $$ log : \mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{S} $$ is a diffeomorphism between two manifolds. We can identify the tangent space at x $ T_{\text{x}}\mathcal{P} $ with $\text{x} \times \mathcal{S} $ .
Induced metric on the Tangent space is given by $$ \langle A , B \rangle_{x}  = \langle dlog(A) |_{x} , dlog(B) |_{x} \rangle  $$ ,where $$
dlog : T_x\mathcal{P} \rightarrow T_{log(x)}\mathcal{S} $$ $$
         A \mapsto A X^{-1}
  $$ Writing out explicitly the inner product on $\mathcal{P}$ is given by $$\langle A , B \rangle_{X} = \text{trace}( A X^{-1} B X ^{-1})$$ Length $L(\gamma)$ and Energy $ E(\gamma)$ of a curve $ \gamma : [0,1] \rightarrow \mathcal{P} $ is given by $$
   L(\gamma) = \int_a^b \| \dfrac{d\gamma}{dt} \|_{\gamma(t)} dt$$ $$E(\gamma) = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \| \dfrac{d\gamma}{dt}\|_{\gamma(t)}^2 dt $$ Geodesics are energy minimizing curves on a manifold. They allow us to introduce distance between two points on a manifold. To calculate them we can simply employ euler lagrange equations $$ \frac{d}{dt} \frac{d}{d\dot{\gamma}} f(t,\gamma(t), \dot{\gamma}(t)) = \frac{d}{d\gamma} f(t,\gamma(t), \dot{\gamma}(t))  $$ writing out explicitly we have $$ \frac{d}{dt} \frac{d}{d\dot{\gamma}}
   \text{trace}( \dot{\gamma} \gamma^{-1} \dot{\gamma} \gamma ^{-1}) = \frac{d}{d\gamma}
   \text{trace}( \dot{\gamma} \gamma^{-1} \dot{\gamma} \gamma ^{-1}) $$ Lefthand side of the equation reduces to $$ \frac{d}{dt} \gamma^{-1} \dot{\gamma} \gamma ^{-1}  $$ whereas the righthand side of the equation reduces to $$ - \gamma^{-1} \dot{\gamma} \gamma^{-1} \dot{\gamma} \gamma^{-1}  $$ Solving the differential equation we get two different expressions for the geodesics. $$ \gamma(t) = P exp(t P^{-1} S) $$ here P lies on the manifold and S lies on the tangent space. Intuitively $\gamma$ is the curve, which starts at P with direction S. $$ \gamma_{AB}(t) = A( A^{-1} B)^t $$ here gamma is the geodesic between the points on the manifold A and B. Now that the geodesics are defined, distance on the spd manifold may be defined via the length of the geodesic curve connecting two points. After some calculations we arrive at $$ d(X,Y) = \| log( X^{-1} Y ) \| $$ So those are my calculations so far. I am quite new to the differential geometry. My first question is do the arguments generally make sense? I am not really convinced that $ dlog = dX X^{-1} $ or that the inner product on $\mathcal{S}$ is $ trace(AB)$ . My ultimate goal is to read christoffel symbols from the geodesics eq. and calculate the riem. curvature. But i am not sure how to proceed or if the calculations so far makes sense. Edit: I tried to find another expression for dlog (and hoped it would be equivalent to $ AX^{-1}$ ) by taking the directional derivative of log-series . But generally the direction in which i take the derivative and the base point wont commute. That is why i dont think my expression for dlog is true.

3269359,Generalizing a theorem from real analysis regarding strictly increasing functions,"This is a question of my own asking, originating from a misinterpretation of OP's question in this thread where I  accidentally proved the following: Theorem : A continuous function $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ that is strictly increasing on $(a,b)$ is also strictly increasing on $[a,b]$ . Proof : Assuming $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function, we'll have $f\Big( (a,b) \Big) = (c,d)$ for some $c,d \in \mathbb{R}$ because the continuous image of a connected set is connected .  Note that this fact also implies $f(b) = w$ for some $w \in [c, d]$ .  Now let's suppose $f(b) \neq d$ ; i.e. suppose $w \in [c, d)$ .  Consider the preimage of the interval $U = (w- \varepsilon, \ w + \varepsilon)$ , where $0 < \varepsilon < |d-w|$ .  It would look like $f^{-1}(U) = V \cup \ \{b\}$ , where $V$ is such that $\{b\}$ is isolated.  Due to this isolated point, $f^{-1}(U)$ cannot be open.  Because $U$ is an open set and $f^{-1}(U)$ is not, $f$ cannot be continuous.  Thus, continuity forces $f(b) = d$ , just as it does $f(a) = c$ by an analogous argument. Having done this, I wondered how easy it would be to adapt the underlying strategy to prove a more general topological statement, and I arrived at this hypothesis ( wrong: see Eric Wofsey's post ): Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space, $U \subset X$ an open set, and $f: \overline{U} \to Y$ a continuous function into a locally compact Hausdorff space where $f:U \to f(U)$ is a homeomorphism.  Then $f: \overline{U} \to f(\overline{U})$ is also a homeomorphism. Some thoughts : Per this fact , I know that it suffices to prove that the restriction of $f$ to the boundary $\partial U$ of $U$ is bijective.  This is why I have chosen the ""locally compact Hausdorff"" condition: I think it might help me guarantee injectivity.  To wit, let's suppose $f(p) = f(q)$ for $p, q \in \partial U$ .  Per Hausdorffness, we can separate $p$ and $q$ with disjoint open neighboorhoods $S_p$ and $S_q$ .  Next, the image of $S_p$ will be a neighborhood of $f(p)$ , which necessarily contains an open neighborhood of $f(p)$ per local compactness.  Then the preimage of this set will have $\{q\}$ as an isolated point, so it cannot be open and thus $f$ would be discontinuous (this feels hand-wavy, as if I'm missing something and don't know what). Questions : Which bits of the above are wrong? What is the most general statement one can make here? How can I tackle surjectivity?  I have a few vague ideas that could make this easier, such as requiring the boundaries of each connected component of $U$ to be connected, but these are largely unsubstantiated hunches, and I feel trying to justify them here would detract from the post. To encourage as much discourse as possible, I'm willing to both accept an answer and award a bounty on a second for substantial replies, assuming I get more than one.

It was said that it can be used with respect to the counting measure because the function $f$ is bounded. Let me restate my question in more general terms: Let $M$ be a countable subset of $\Bbb R$ and $f$ be bounded and continuous. Let $(a(k))_{k\in M}$ and $(a_n (k) )_{k\in  M}$ be sequences of non-negative numbers for fixed $n$ , such that $\sum_{k\in M} a_n (k) = 1, \sum_{k\in M} a(k) = 1$ . Moreover, we assume that $a_n(k) \to a(k)$ for fixed $k\in M$ .

However, the counting measure is not a finite measure, thus $\vert g  \vert \leq \vert f \vert$ is not useful here because $f$ is not integrable, though it is bounded.

3269631,Counting dissimilar championship outcomes,"Let's say we have a football league with 16 teams.

We consider tournament outcomes to be similar if the outcomes described above are the same. What is the number of dissimilar outcomes? I should note, however, that outcomes are considered similar if the 15th and 16th places are reversed because the order doesn't matter when both teams leave the championship. I know the answer is: $\frac{16!}{8!2!}$ My approach to the problem is that we should count the number of permutations of 16 items 8 of which are considered indistinguishable, as well as 2 that can be reversed. I am not sure that this is correct, but anyway I want to calculate the number of dissimilar outcomes directly. Probably, it makes sense to calculate the number of similar items first. We first count the number in which we can choose 6 teams from 16 (respecting the order) then multiply it by the number of ways to choose 2 more items from the remaining 10. This is the total number of ways to fix the ""important"" positions, which we should also multiply by $8!$ (the number of permutations for the non-important positions).

3269652,$T_pS \subseteq T_pM$: Are tangent spaces of submanifolds subsets (and not embedded) of tangent spaces of the original manifold?,"My book is An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring W. Tu.

I believe both equalities are really equalities are not isomorphisms (see this question , my previous question and my other previous question ). This question says the differential of inclusion map of smooth manifolds is an inclusion map of tangent spaces. Question 1. If A and B are indeed equalities, then is it really that $T_pS \subseteq T_pM$ (this may or may not be vector subspace, but I think it is) for $S \subseteq M$ a regular/embedded submanifold and not merely that $T_pS$ is (vector space) isomorphic to a vector subspace of $T_pM$ (so $T_pS$ is embedded, in the vector space sense , but probably equivalent to the manifold sense , in $T_pM$ )? Question 2. If A and B are indeed equalities and the answer to (1) is yes, then, then how do we see this from Definition 8.1 and Remark 8.2 with $C_p^\infty S$ and $C_p^{\infty} M$ ? I think I can kind of see this geometrically with $S=S^1$ , $M=\mathbb R^2$ and $p=(1,0)$ with $T_pS^1$ , as the vertical line isomorphic to $\mathbb R$ with $p$ as origin, being a vector subspace of $T_p\mathbb R^2$ , as the plane isomorphic to $\mathbb R^2$ with $p$ as origin but I don't quite see how a map $D:C_p^{\infty}S \to \mathbb R$ is also a map $D:C_p^{\infty}M \to \mathbb R$ . I think we somehow do some kind of smooth extensions, but most of the smooth extensions I've encountered are from open submanifolds or open subsets are not arbitrary regular submanifolds. Maybe $C_p^{\infty} S \supseteq C_p^\infty M$ or something. Question 3. If (A) is merely an isomorphism and not equality, then why exactly? Is it actually that (B) is also merely an isomorphism and not equality, and if so, then why exactly? Note: Other definitions of tangent space of submanifold seem to be explicit in being subsets of tangent spaces (at the same point) of the original manifold.

We will now show that every derivation of $C^\infty (M)$ arises from one and only one vector field. To distinguish the vector filed from the derivation, we will temporarily denote the derivation arising from $X$ by $\phi(X)$ .

3269835,A riddle about guessing hat colours (which is not among the commonly known ones),"This is a riddle I heard recently, and my question is if someone happens to know the solution. I'm asking this out of curiosity more than anything else. So here it is. The riddle is one of the countless variations of the ""prisoners have to guess their hat colour"" puzzle. $n$ prisoners are put a hat on top of their head, which can be red or blue. The colours are chosen at random by $n$ independent fair coin tosses. Then each prisoner can guess their own hat colour (red or blue) or pass. The prisoners can see each other, but not hear each other's calls and of course they have no other means of communication. This means that each call can only depend on the other prisoners' hat colours. However, before the distributing of hats begins, the prisoners are told the rules and can agree on a strategy. The prisoners win iff no prisoner guesses wrong and at least one prisoner guesses right. Which strategy should the prisoners use so that the winning probability becomes maximal? Some remarks: A simple strategy is that one player just guesses and all other players pass, so that the maximal probabilty is at least 1/2. For $n=2$ this strategy is optimal. For $n=3$, there is a strategy that wins in 6 out of 8 cases: When a player sees (red,red) he guesses blue, for (blue,blue) he guesses red, and otherwise he passes. More generally this shows that the maximal probability is at least 3/4 for $n\ge 3$. It's possible to show that any strategy fails for at least 2 hat colour configurations (unless $n=1$), which shows that the above strategy is optimal for $n=3$. For $n=4$ there are more than $10^{15}$ strategies, and for $n=5$ it's about $10^{38}$ strategies, making it quite infeasible to just use a brute-force computer program (maybe for $n=4$ it's possible when exploiting the obvious symmetries). When changing the rules slightly by forbidding players to pass, then the maximal winning probability is always 1/2. This is a nice little exercise. Actually I heard the riddle only for $n=3$ and then thought about the general $n$. So it's entirely possible that there is no nice solution.","['puzzle', 'probability']"

This theorem says (more or less) : If $F:\mathbb R\times \mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^n$ is locally Lipschitz w.r.t. the second variable, then the Cauchy problem $$\begin{cases}\dot x(t)=F(t,x(t))\\ x(0)=x_0\end{cases}$$ has a unique (local) solution. So indeed, we take $F(t,x)=A(t)x$ which is obviously globally Lipschitz. But in one case we have a Cauchy problem, and in the other case we have an ODE without initial condition.","['linear-algebra', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"

In particular, why is it sufficient for an operator to be considered well-defined, when we can show that for any $f \in L^{p}$ that $\|\ell_{f}\|_{*}<\infty$ . In my previous, elementary versions of well-definedness, we defined it as for any $f \in L^{q}$ there exists exactly one $\ell\in (L^{p})^{*}$ so that $Jf=\ell$ . Now showing that $\| Jf\|_{*}<\infty$ definitely shows that $Jf \in (L^{p})^{*}$ but it does not show that there is a unique $\ell \in (L^{p})^{*}$ so that $Jf=\ell$ . In other words, there may exist another $m \in (L^{p})^{*}$ where $m\neq \ell$ so that $m = Jf$ and $\ell = Jf$ . I thought that this was the point of proving well-definition. Why is it always reduced to the idea that well-definition depends only on whether $\|\ell_{f}\|_{*}<\infty$ ?

3270210,Show that $\text{Spec }A^G$ is the quotient of the affine scheme $\text{Spec }A$ by a finite subgroup of automorphisms $G$,"Let $X=\text{Spec }A$ be an affine scheme, and $G$ a finite subgroup of automorphisms of $X$ . Show that $\text{Spec }A^G$ is $X/G$ , with $\pi: X\to X/G$ given by the natural inclusion. That is, we need to show $\text{Spec }A^G$ satisfies the universal property of the quotient, where $A^G$ is the fixed ring of automorphisms, and the universal property is that (A) $\pi\circ g=\pi$ for all $g\in G$ , and (B) If $Y$ is any scheme and $\phi :X\to Y$ a morphism of schemes such that $\phi\circ g=\phi$ for all $g\in G$ , then it factors through $\text{Spec }A^G$ . Now, if $Y$ is affine, I think the problem is easy. Since the (antiequivalent) fact is true at the level of rings, then it must be true at the level of affine schemes. That is, if $\psi:B\to A$ satisfies $g\psi(b)=\psi(b)$ for all $g$ , then there's a well-defined map $\theta:B \to A^G$ with $\theta(b)=\psi(b)$ that clearly commutes with the inclusion. However, I'm stuck for when $Y$ is non-affine. The question hints that you should use Prime avoidance, and I think this is used in showing that the fibres consist of the orbits, but I don't know exactly what I am supposed to show. I added this later, and I'd welcome any corrections, or plainly telling me if I am wrong: First let us investigate the fibres of the map $\pi$ . The inclusion $A^G\hookrightarrow A$ is integral, since every element of $z\in A$ satisfies an equation of the form $\prod_{g\in G}(x-gz)$ . Hence, each fiber is non-empty by the Lying Over Theorem. Now if we have two primes in the same fibre, that is $P\cap A^G=Q\cap A^G$ , then $P\subseteq \bigcup_{g\in G}gQ$ since if $p\in P$ , then $\prod_{g\in G} gu \in P\cap A^G=Q\cap A^G$ , so some factor $gu$ must be in $Q$ . By prime avoidance, $P\subseteq gQ$ for some $g$ , and again by integrality (or even by symmetry) we can conclude $P=gQ$ . Suppose $\phi:\text{Spec } A\to Y$ is a morphism of schemes satisfying $G$ -invariance as above. I think the most logical way is to define a map $\bar{\phi}:\text{Spec }A^G\to Y$ set theoretically as $\bar\phi(P)=\phi(P)$ . Then to show it is continuous, it would be enough to prove that $\pi$ is a closed map, since $\bar\phi^{-1}(C)$ for some closed set $C\subseteq Y$ is precisely ${\pi(\phi^{-1}(C))}$ . For this, it would be enough to show that, if $\phi^{-1}(C)=V(a)$ for some ideal $a\subseteq A$ , then $V(a\cap A^G)\subseteq\pi(V(a))$ , (since we have the equality $V(a\cap A^G)=\overline{\pi(V(a))}$ ). But this is true by the Lying Over theorem argument. Therefore $\bar\phi$ is continuous. Finally, notice that for $f\in A^G$ , we have that the localization $(A^G)_f=(A_f)^G$ , therefore $\mathcal O_{\text{Spec }A^G}=\pi_*(\mathcal O_{\text{Spec }A})^G$ . Hence the map $\mathcal O_Y\to \phi_*(\mathcal O_{\text{Spec }A})^G=\bar\phi_*\pi_*(\mathcal O_{\text{Spec }A})^G=\bar\phi_*\mathcal O_{\text{Spec }A^G}$ already exists and canonically gives a morphism of sheaves $\mathcal O_Y\to \bar\phi_*\mathcal O_{\text{Spec }A^G}$ that finishes our morphism of schemes.","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'quotient-spaces']"

Also, $G$ is induced in $H$ . I am stuck at a particular part of the proof. Since diameter of $G$ is two, $G$ can at the most contain one diametral vertex or at the most one vertex with eccentricity $r+1$ . I divided the proof in two cases. In first part, $G$ contains a vertex with eccentricity $r+1$ . This part has been proved by me. In second case, $G$ does not contain a vertex with eccentricity $r+1$ and I am stuck in this case. However, I tried to prove it, but I am feeling that it is not surely true. In the following attempt I consider a $z-w$ walk of length $r$ but I feel it is wrong as we already get a $z-w$ path of length $r$ lying on $x-y$ path since $z$ is adjacent to $x$ . MY ATTEMPT: Let $P$ be a diametral path in $H$ of length $r+1$ with end vertices $x$ and $y$ ( $x,y\notin G$ ). Since $diam(G) =2$ , at the most 3 vertices of $G$ can lie on $P$ and thus $P$ contains at least $r-1$ new vertices. Since $r\geq 4$ , $r+1\geq 5$ and $P$ contains at least six vertices. If $x$ and $y$ are  end vertices of $P$ which are not in $G$ then there exists $z\notin V(G)$ and $x\sim z$ or $y\sim z$ .
Without loss of generality, let $x\sim z$ . Since $e(z)=r$ , there exists a $z-w$ path $P_2$ such that $l(P_2)=r =d(z,w)$ . Now, the path $P$ can not be extended, otherwise $d(x,y)>r+1$ ,
and $P_2$ contains at most three vertices from $G$ . This follows that at least $r-2$ vertices in $P_2$ are not in $G$ .
This proves that we need to add at least $(r-1) +(r-2) = 2r-3$ new vertices. Is this proof correct? I feel this proof is still incomplete. Somewhere I feel that I am missing some part. Kindly help me. Thanks a lot for your time and help. P.S. It might be possible that $P$ and $P_2$ intersect at many vertices. In that case how to prove the result. ---------------------------------------------------- Added one more point in the proof (edited proof) $G$ does not contain any diametral vertex. Since $diam(G) =2$ , here also $P$ contains at least $r-1$ new vertices. Since $r\geq 4$ and $r+1\geq 5$ , $P$ contains at least six vertices. If $x$ and $y$ are  end vertices of $P$ which are not in $G$ then there exists $z\notin V(G)$ and $x\sim z$ or $y\sim z$ .
Without loss of generality, let $x\sim z$ . Since $e(z)=r$ , there exists a $z$ -- $w$ path $P_2: z,w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_r=w$ such that $l(P_2)=r =d(z,w)$ .
Now, the path $P$ can not be extended, otherwise $d(x,y)>r+1$ .
Now, the $P_2$ contains at most three vertices from $G$ since $diam(G) =2$ .
Further, if $P_2$ intersect vertices of the $P$ then $d(z,w)<r$ , which
is a contradiction because $e(z) = r$ . This follows that at least $r-2$ vertices in $P_2$ are not in $G$ .","['graph-theory', 'proof-writing', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

3270550,Unable to apply transformation of function $f(x)$ with $g(x)=-f(-x)$.,"The problem is taken from the chap. 1.1 of the book titled : Calculus Problems for the new century, by Robert Fraga. A function $f$ has values $f(0) =3, f(2)=1$ , is piecewise linear, & has the slope $-1$ if $x\lt 0$ and $1$ if $x\gt 2$ . Sketch the graph of the function $g$ defined by each of the following rules. a. $\,\,\,g(x)=f(x)$ b. $\,\,\,g(x)=-f(-x)$ c. $\,\,\,g(x)=f(x+2)$ d. $\,\,\,g(x)=f(2x)$ e. $\,\,\,g(x)=f(3x-6)$ I have prepared solutions, which are not matching in part (b) (& have confusion for part (e)) with the book's solutions, which are given in terms of graphs. The book's solutions are shown below: My solutions: I assume that the curve is connected between the points $x=0$ and $x=2$ . The equation of the curve will be given by : Part (a): (i) $y = -x+3,\,\,\, x\le 2$ (ii) $y = x-1,\,\,\, x\gt 2$ For Part (b), my graph is wrong, as per the solution given. Part (b): (i) $y=-(x+3),\,\,\, -(-x)\le -2$ $\implies y= -x-3,\,\,\, -x \ge 2$ $\implies y= -x-3,\,\,\, x \le -2$ (ii) $y = -(-x-1),\,\,\, -(-x)\gt -2$ $\implies y = x+1,\,\,\, -x\lt 2$ $\implies y = x+1,\,\,\, x\gt -2$ For Part (c), my graph is correct, as per the solution given; as the solution shows the ordinate axis starting from $y=1$ . Part (c): (i) $y = -(x+2)+3,\,\,\, x+2\le 2\implies y = -x+1,\,\,\, x\le 0$ (ii) $y = (x+2)-1,\,\,\, (x+2)\gt 2\implies y = x+1,\,\,\, x\gt 0$ For Part (d), my graph is correct, as per the solution given; as the solution shows the ordinate axis starting from $y=1$ . Part (d): (i) $y = -2x+3,\,\,\, 2x\le 2\implies y = -2x+3,\,\,\, x\le 1$ (ii) $y = 2x-1,\,\,\, 2x\gt 2\implies y = 2x-1,\,\,\, x\gt 1$ For Part (e), the solution given is not clear about minimum value of function being $1$ ; hence unsure. Part (e): (i) $y = -(3x-6)+3= -3x+9,\,\,\, 3x-6\le 2\implies y = -3x+9,\,\,\, x\le 2\frac 23$ (ii) $y = 3x-7,\,\,\,  3x-6\gt 2\implies y = 3x-7,\,\,\,  x\gt 2\frac 23$ Edit : Have found the correct solution in part (b) by only affecting the domain with change of $x$ by $-x$ to get equations: Part (b): (i) $y=-(x+3),\,\,\, (-x)\le 2$ $\implies y= -x-3,\,\,\, x \ge -2$ (ii) $y = -(-x-1),\,\,\, (-x)\gt 2$ $\implies y = x+1,\,\,\, x\lt -2$ But, seems like am missing theory as why for $g(x)=-f(-x)$ only the domain is affected by exchanging $x$ by $-x$ ; even though it means that the whole function is also negated.","['functions', 'graphing-functions']"
3270656,Do products preserve colimits in the category of locales?,"Does the functor $X\times-:\mathbf{Loc}\to\mathbf{Loc}$ preserve small colimits for all locales $X$ ? The reason that I'm interested in this question is that the same property fails in the category of topological spaces. If products preserve colimits in a total category then it must be cartesian closed. The category $\mathbf{Top}$ is total, but fails to be cartesian closed because products don't preserve colimits. So it would be curious if $\mathbf{Loc}$ failed to be cartesian closed for the complementary reason. It's not total, so maybe products do preserve colimits in $\mathbf{Loc}$ ? Another reason to ask this question is that the definition of ""locale"" requires precisely that products preserve colimits in its frame of opens. So it would be interesting if this property was mirrored at the category level.","['general-topology', 'limits-colimits', 'locales', 'category-theory']"

3270756,Cocycles and group extensions,"I'm trying to understand how elements in the second cohomology group with coefficients in some other group correspond to group extensions. This is what I understand: Suppose we have two (countable) abelian groups $G,H$ . The second cohomology group $H^2(G,H)$ is defined as the group of all functions (cocycles) $c:G\times G\rightarrow H$ with the property that for all $g_1,g_2,g_3\in G$ $$c(g_1+g_2,g_3)+c(g_1,g_2) = c(g_2,g_1+g_3)+c(g_1,g_3)$$ Modulo functions (coboundaries) of the form $c(g,h) = f(g+h)-f(g)-f(h)$ for any $f:G\rightarrow H$ . Now any element $c\in H^2(G,H)$ defines a group extension $G\times_c H$ which is defined as the cartesian product of $G$ and $H$ with the multiplication $$(g,h)+ (g',h') = (g+g',c(g,g')+h+h')$$ If $c$ is a coboundary then one can prove easily that $G\times_c H$ is isomorphic to $G\times H$ (the usual product) with the isomorphism $(g,h)\mapsto (g,f(g)+h)$ . Note moreover, that the extension is abelian if $c(g_1,g_2) = c(g_2,g_1)$ (in fact, if there exists a co-boundary $d$ such that $c+d$ satisfies the above). I have the following questions I showed that if $c$ is a coboundary then $G\times_c H\cong G\times H$ . More generally one can show that if $c-c'$ is a coboudnary then $G\times_c H \cong G\times_{c'} H$ . Is this an if and only if? I mean, if $G\times_c H \cong G\times_{c'} H$ does it mean that $c-c'$ a coboundary? [As far as I understand this should be true, but I don't manage to prove it] It is well known that the group $\mathbb{Q}$ is injective (because it is divisible). This means that any abelian extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ splits. In other words, if the answer for $1$ is yes, then this would imply that any abelian cocycle $c:G\times G\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ is a coboundary. Is there any explicit proof for that? I'm more interested in question number 2, which technically can be formulated without the notion of a cocycle. Is any function $c:G\times G\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ with $c(g_1,g_2)=c(g_2,g_1)$ and $$c(g_1+g_2,g_3)+c(g_1,g_2) = c(g_2,g_1+g_3)+c(g_1,g_3)$$ takes the form $c(g_1,g_2)=f(g_1+g_2)-f(g_1)-f(g_2)$ ?","['group-extensions', 'group-theory', 'group-cohomology']"

Then $\lim_\limits{x \rightarrow \frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\sin(\cos(x))}{\cos(x)} = 1$ , since the limit of $\sin(x)/x$ is 1 as $x \rightarrow 0$ . Multiple online solutions suggest the same without any explanation. How to show this rigorously?

3271054,( Proof Explanation ) Show that a certain system preserves the weighted area $ (dx \wedge dy)/xy$,"I already told few questions ago that I'm currently reading an abstract about the Lotka Volterra differential equations. But now I have a proof, where I need explanations. Consider: $$ \dot{x} = -xy\frac{\delta H}{ \delta y} , x(0) = \hat{x} $$ $$  \dot{y} = xy\frac{\delta H}{ \delta x} , y(0) = \hat{y} $$ where $H(x,y) = x + y - ln(x) -ln(y)$ . I have to show that this System preserve the weighted area $(dx \wedge dy)/xy$ .
I marked my Questions in the proof below. Proof : Let $\Omega_0$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ at time $t_0$ and $ \Omega_1$ the set into which $\Omega_0$ is mapped by the system above at time $t_1$ . Preservation of $(dx \wedge dy)xy$ is equivalent to $$ \int_{\Omega_0} \frac{1}{xy}dxdy = \int_{\Omega_1} \frac{1}{xy} dxdy $$ first Question: why is this equivalent? We now look at the Domain $D$ in x,y,t space with bondary $\delta D$ given by $\Omega_0$ at $t_0$ , $\Omega_1$ at $t_1$ and the set of trajectories emerging from the boundary of $\Omega_0$ and ending on the boudnary of $\Omega_1$ . Consider the vector field $$ v := \frac{1}{xy}(\dot{x},\dot{y},1)^T $$ in $x,y,t$ space. Integrating this vector field over the boundary $\delta D$ of $D$ , we obtain $$ \int_{\delta D} v \cdot n = \int_{\Omega_0} v \cdot n_0 + \int_{\Omega_1} v \cdot n_1 = \int_{\Omega_0} \frac{1}{xy} dxdy - \int_{\Omega_1} \frac{1}{xy}dxdy $$ where $n_0 =(0,0,-1)^T$ denote the unit outward normal of $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega_1$ . Second question & Third question: Can you explain why we integrate $v \cdot n$ ? I thought we integrate $v$ and can you explain the first equation above? There is no other contribution to the surface integral, because the vector field $v$ is by contruction parallel to the trajectories, which form the rest of the bondary $\delta D$ . Forth question: Can you explain why vector field is parallel to the trajectories? Applying the divergence theorem to the left hand side of the same equation, we get $$ \int_{\delta D} v \cdot n = \int_D \nabla v = \int_D - \frac{\delta H^2}{\delta x \delta y} + \frac{ \delta H^2}{\delta x \delta y} + 0 = 0 $$ which concludes the proof.
