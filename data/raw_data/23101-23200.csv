199935,Extension of the Sylvester-Gallai theorem?,"The Sylvester-Gallai theorem asserts that given a finite number of points in the euclidean plane, either: the points are collinear there exists an ordinary line (i.e. a line that contains exactly two of the given points). Question: Is it possible to extend this result to more general (complete) 2-manifolds (where ""lines"" are replaced by geodesics)?
  And if so, what conditions must these 2-manifolds satisfy? I'm quite surprised that I haven't found anything about this question on the internet.
It seems to be a quite natural question. References are also much appreciated.","['geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

199949,Definition of a meromorphic function by Forster's Lectures on Riemann Surfaces,"Here's the definition. Let $X$ be a Riemann surface and $Y$ be an open subset of $X$.
A meromorphic function on $Y$ is a holomorphic function $f\colon Y' \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ satisfying the following conditions, where $Y'\subset Y$ is a open subset. (1) Every point $p\in Y - Y'$ is an isolated point. (2) For every point $p\in Y - Y'$, $\lim_{x\rightarrow p} |f(x)| = \infty$. The points of $Y - Y'$ are called the poles of $f$. Then he stated in a remark: Let $(U, z)$ be a coordinate neighborhood of a pole $p$ of $f$ with $z(p) = 0$.
Then $f$ can be expanded in a Laurent series $f = \sum_{n = -k}^{\infty} c_n z^n$ in a neighborhood of $p$. Why is this so?  In other words, why $p$ cannot be an essential singularity ?","['riemann-surfaces', 'complex-analysis']"

199988,Existence of a specific refinement of an open cover on a manifold,"I've encountered a homework question I don't know how to solve, and most people I asked even tend to go so far as to say that the main statement in the question is false.

Any help would be greatly appreciated :-) First we define $\{ U_\alpha \}$ to be an open cover of a manifold $M$. The question is now to prove that there exists a refinement $\{ V_\alpha \}$ of $\{ U_\alpha \}$, such that $\overline{ V_\alpha } \subset U_\alpha $ for all $\alpha$ (the closure of every $V_\alpha$ must be a subset of every $U_\alpha$).

200326,Why are measures real-valued?,"Measures, as I understand it, exist to give us some sense of the ""size"" of a set. However, there's a lot of detail they gloss over, sometimes – the usual measure ignores all countable sets, for example. What I'm wondering is if this is not because the real number it gives us is in some sense not ""rich"" enough to reflect that information. I understand that the real numbers are the unique complete totally ordered Archimedean field. I can see that: Totally ordered seems pretty essential. Indeed, a definition of ""size"" that wasn't comparable would be fairly nonsensical. Complete seems sensible, given how many theorems in measure theory are based around convergence. Field... well, measures often actually take values in $[0,\infty]$, rather than $\mathbb R$, so it's not a field. Certainly I can see that having addition form a commutative and injective monoid (injective, that is, apart from $\infty$, which might cause problems) makes sense. Multiplication and division, as a commenter has pointed out, are key in probability theory, particularly in the definition of conditional probability, so I can see how they are desirable. But the Archimedean property is where I start to be skeptical. As I see it, the size of sets isn't intuitively an Archimedean structure. No matter how many small sets I have, I can't make a bigger set, for any of several reasonable definitions of ""small"" and ""big"". So, is it possible that there could be some other structure, possibly non-Archimedean, or not a field, that could serve as the codomain of a measure, and provide richer information about the ""size"" of the set? Or is there something inevitable about the real numbers in this context that I'm not seeing? To pre-empt some possible answers: I am willing to accept that measures evolved as real-valued functions out of convenience, but I would be surprised if no-one ever thought of doing it differently. So I think any answer that does not at least consider the possibility of alternatives isn't what I'm looking for. I realise that ""as much information as possible"" isn't necessarily the aim of a measure, and it gains some expedience by abstracting away from sets we think too small to care about. But just as sometimes you want a coarse tool (say, ""empty or non-empty""), that throws away boring detail, sometimes you'd like a finer tool (cardinality or volume or...) that abstracts less. A commenter has pointed out to me that there exist complex- and vector-valued measures, which I did not know. This is interesting, but doesn't seem to give richer size information, rather modelling another phenomenon entirely (e.g. signed measures can be used to model charge, I am told). So that's probably not what I'm looking for. (I notice that you can define a vector-valued measure by just taking a set to its indicator function, losing zero information. But then measures aren't comparable, so I don't consider this a reasonable notion of volume).",['measure-theory']
200333,Subgroups of $S_{4}$ that contain the kernel of a homomorphism $\varphi:S_{4}\to S_{3}$,"This is an exercise from Artin's Algebra 2nd Ed. The exercise refers to the following example from the text: The three partitions of the set of four indices 
  $\{\mathbf{1},\mathbf{2},\mathbf{3},\mathbf{4}\}$ into pairs of subsets of order two are :$$\Pi_{1}\colon\{\mathbf{1},\mathbf{2}\}\cup\{\mathbf{3},\mathbf{4}\},\quad\Pi_{2}\colon\{\mathbf{1},\mathbf{3}\}\cup\{\mathbf{2},\mathbf{4}\},\quad\Pi_{3}\colon\{\mathbf{1},\mathbf{4}\}\cup\{\mathbf{2},\mathbf{3}\}.$$ An element of the symmetric group $S_{4}$ permutes the four indices, and by doing so it also permutes these three partions. This defines a map $\varphi$ from $S_{4}$ to the group of permutations of the set $\{\Pi_{1},\Pi_{2},\Pi_{3}\}$, which is just the symmetric group $S_{3}$. The example goes on to show that $\varphi$ is a homomorphism and that Its kernel can be computed. It is the subgroup of $S_{4}$ consisting of the identity and the three products of disjoint transpositions:
  $$K=\left\{1,~(\mathbf{1}~\mathbf{2})(\mathbf{3}~\mathbf{4}),~(\mathbf{1}~\mathbf{3})(\mathbf{2}~\mathbf{4}),~(\mathbf{1}~\mathbf{4})(\mathbf{2}~\mathbf{3})\right\}.$$ The exercise then asks: Determine the six subgroups of $S_{4}$ that contain $K$. I have two difficulties with this exercise. How was $K$ computed? And how can I determine the subgroups of $S_{4}$ that contain $K$ without having to just use brute force to compute all the possible cycle permutations?

Our first observation is that for any 0 < p < 1 we will eventually see the pattern (H, H, H, H).
Suppose that the first such pattern starts at the nth flip. If n > 1, then the n − 1th flip
cannot be H since then the first (H, H, H, H) pattern would have started before the nth flip.
Hence in this case the n − 1th flip is necessarily T, and starting with the n − 1th flip we see
the pattern (T, H, H, H, H). In that sequence, (T, H, H, H) appears before (H, H, H, H).
Summarizing, (H, H, H, H) can only appear before (T, H, H, H) if it starts immediately at
the n = 1st flip, that is if all four first flips are heads. The probability of that is $p^4$.",['probability']

Let $f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be continuous. I know that the Riemann integral $I:=\int_{0}^{1} f(x)dx$ exists. I also know that  the Lebesgue integral of $f$ exists. 
The question is to construct an increasing sequence of simple functions $h_{n}$ with limit $f$ satisfying $h_{n}\leq f$ and $\int h_{n} \ d\lambda \ \uparrow I$. The hint was to use the definition of the Riemann integral so I tried..
We know because $h_{n}$ needs to be simple that it is of the form $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{i} \textbf{1}_{A_{i}}$.
My idea for $h_{n}$ now was $$h_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\min_{x\in[\frac{i}{n},\frac{i+1}{n}]}|f(x)| \textbf{1} _{\{[\frac{i}{n},\frac{i+1}{n}]\}}$$ If $s\in[\frac{i}{n},\frac{i+1}{n}]$ then $h_{n}(s)$ takes the minimum value of the function $|f|$ on this interval. It is obvious that we get 
$$\int h_{n} \ d\lambda=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \min_{x\in[\frac{i}{n},\frac{i+1}{n}]} |f(x)| \cdot \frac{1}{n}$$ This indeed converges to $I$, the area under the function $f$ but now $h_{n}\leq f$ does not hold and neither is the sequence $h_{n}$ increasing to $f$. I've also tried to not take the absolute value of $f$ in the function of $h_{n}$ but just the value $f(x)$ but the the lebesgue integral of $h_{n}$ does not go to the area under the function $f$.

200520,Existence of divisors of degree one on a curve over a finite field,"Let $C$ be a smooth, geometrically irreducible projective curve defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. 
Given a (scheme-theoretic) point $x \in C$, define the degree of $x$ to be the degree of the extension $[k(x): \mathbb{F}_q]$. The degree of a divisor on $C$ can thus be defined by linearity. We proved today in my algebraic number theory class that there is  always a divisor of degree one. The argument was to suppose that all the degrees $[k(x): \mathbb{F}_q]$ were divisible by some $m  >1$, and then to  apply (a very weak form of) the Cebotarev density theorem to the extension of function fields $k(C) \to k(C) \otimes_{\mathbb{F}_q} \mathbb{F}_{q^m}$. All places would have to split completely if $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ is contained in every residue field, which is a contradiction. I also learned  another proof from a comment of Felipe Voloch on MO: for large $n$, the Weil bound on the number of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-rational points implies that there is a point of degree $n$ and a point of degree $n+1$. Taking the difference gives a divisor of degree one. Is there an elementary geometric way of seeing this?

Those values are $(k_1,k_2)=\{(1,1),(0,3)\}.$ Given that $k_1+k_2+k_3=7$, $k_3$ are respectively $5$ and $4$. Hence, the coefficient of the $x^3$ is
$${7 \choose 1,1,5}(-5)^{5}+{7 \choose 0,3,4}(-5)^4.$$ Given that the definition of the multinomial coefficient is

My questions are For a finite measure space if a random variable  is almost everywhere finite then does not it mean that it expectation is finite? That too when I work in [$0,T$] not in [$0,\infty$] Can someone give me a counter example stating that a function belonging to the more general localization-technique defined space and not into the $L^2$ space.

200704,Being characteristic is transitive,"Here, I wanted to verify that: The property of being characteristic is a transitive relation among subgroups of a group $G$. For subgroups $N,H\leq G$, we have $N$ char $G$ and $H$ char $N$. So $N$ char $G$ implies: $$\forall\psi\in Aut(G); \psi(N)=N$$ $H$ char $N$, so for all elements in $Aut(N)$, $H$ is remained never changing. Especially, when I take $\psi'=\psi|_{N}$ then $\psi':N\to Aut(N)$ would be in $Aut(N)$ and $\psi'(H)=H$. Since the last equality is true for $H$ and the maps, caused by restriction on $N$, then I have $H$ char $G$.

200743,"Non surjectivity of the exponential map to GL(2,R)","I was asked to show that the exponential map $\exp: \mathfrak{g} \mapsto G$ is not surjective by proving that the matrix $\left(\matrix{-1 & 0 \\ 0 & -2}\right)\in \text{GL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ can't be the exponential of any matrix $A \in \mathfrak{gl}(2,\mathbb{R})$. My proof (edited) Lemma : A diagonal matrix $M \in \rm{GL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ is the exponential of a matrix $A\in\mathfrak{gl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ if it has positive eigenvalues or a unique (double) negative eigenvalue. For any diagonal matrix $A = \left(\matrix{a & 0 \\ 0 & d}\right)$, we have  $\displaystyle\text{e}^A=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\dfrac{A^k}{k!} = \left(\matrix{\text{e}^a & 0 \\ 0 & \text{e}^d}\right)$. Then, 
    $$\forall\; \lambda,\,\mu > 0, \qquad\left(\matrix{\lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \mu}\right) = \exp \left(\matrix{\ln\lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \ln\mu}\right)$$ By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, every square matrix is a root of its characteristic polynomial. Thus I can express any power of $A$ as a linear combination of $A$ itself and the identity matrix. For instance, $A^2= tA-d\mathbb{I}\;$ and $A^3=(t^2-d)A-td\mathbb{I}\;$, where $t=\text{tr} A, \; d=\det A$. It follows that $M=\text{e}^A=\alpha A+\beta\mathbb{I}\;$ (even if I don't know how to calculate those coefficients). If $M$ has distinct negative eigenvalues, $\alpha \neq 0$: otherwise we'd have $M = \beta \mathbb{I}$, a contradiction. This implies that  $A$ must be diagonal too, but then it can't exponentiate to something with negative eigenvalues (see below the conclusion of my exercise). If $M$ has a double negative eigenvalue, it is a negative multiple of $\mathbb{I}$ and $\alpha$ must be $0$. Observing that $\exp\left(\matrix{0 & \pi \\ -\pi & 0}\right)=\left(\matrix{-1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1}\right)=-\mathbb{I}$ and experimenting a bit, it is straightforward to prove that
    $$\forall\; \lambda>0, \qquad -\lambda\mathbb{I}=\left(\matrix{-\lambda & 0 \\ 0 & -\lambda}\right)=\exp\left(\matrix{\ln\lambda & \pm\, m\pi \\ \mp\, m\pi & \ln\lambda}\right), \qquad \forall m \; \text{odd integer}$$ The conclusion is immediate: the diagonal matrix I'm given must be the exponential of a diagonal matrix (if it exists) $A = \left(\matrix{a & 0 \\ 0 & d}\right)$ such that $\text{e}^a=-1\;\text{and}\;\text{e}^d=-2$, which is impossible. Alternative approach, problems and questions My efforts were aimed at using that $\exp(PXP^{-1})=P\exp XP^{-1},\; \forall X\in \mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R}),\forall P\in\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$. The problem is that if $\exp X$ is a diagonal non-scalar matrix, then it doesn't lie in the center of the algebra and thus doesn't commute with $P$. That's a pity, because I can (almost) always diagonalize $A=\left(\matrix{a & b \\ c & d}\right)$, writing $A=PXP^{-1}$, where $X$ is diagonal: If $\det A = 0$, since $\text{tr}A \neq 0$, $A$ has two distinct eigenvalues ($0$ and $\text{tr}A$) and is diagonalizable If $\det A \neq 0$, the characteristic equation is $\lambda^2-\text{tr}A\lambda +\det A = 0$ and if its discriminant is $\Delta \neq 0$, then again I get two (possibly complex) distinct eigenvalues and $A$ is diagonalizable. if $\Delta = 0$, the only eigenvalue is $\lambda=\dfrac12 \text{tr}A$, whose geometric multiplicity is only $1$, making $A$ not diagonalizable. This line of thought seems quite promising to me. I was wondering if it exists some way to conclude the proof of the ""diagonalizable $A$"" case from $P\left(\matrix{\text{e}^{\lambda_1} & 0 \\ 0 & \text{e}^{\lambda_2}}\right)P^{-1} = \left(\matrix{-1 & 0 \\ 0 & -2}\right)$ and then to handle the ""non-diagonalizable $A$"" case. Bonus question I was also trying to work with the other property $\exp(X+Y)=\exp X \exp Y \quad \text{iff}\quad [X,Y]=0$, exploiting some decomposition of $A$, such as
$$A = \left(\matrix{a & b \\ c & d}\right) = A_{\text{sym}}+A_{\text{antisym}}\;, \quad\text{where}\quad A_{\text{sym}}=\frac12(A+A^T) \;,\;A_{\text{antisym}}=\frac12(A-A^T)$$ 
$$\text{or} \quad A = \left(\matrix{a & b \\ c & d}\right) = A_{\text{diag}}+A_{\text{antidiag}}\;, \quad\text{where}\quad A_{\text{diag}}=\left(\matrix{a & 0 \\ 0 & d}\right) \;,\;A_{\text{antisym}}=\left(\matrix{0 & b \\ c & 0}\right)\;. $$ Unfortunately, both decomposition don't help, because $[A_{\text{sym}},A_{\text{antisym}}] \neq 0$, $[A_{\text{diag}},A_{\text{antidiag}}] \neq 0$. Is there a chance that something like this could lead to a solution? Update: Thanks to Pink Elephants, who pointed out a flaw in my proof, I modified the statement of the lemma and added some detail. I think now it works well for my exercise.","['linear-algebra', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

I have always assumed that ""between"" is an approximation, since, at quadrature, though the Earth's motion is contributing nothing to the planet's apparent motion (since it is moving directly along the line of sight to the planet), the planet's true motion is providing apparent ""direct motion"", so that retrograde motion, though bounded by the quadrature points, does not begin or end there. I've never been able to prove this to my satisfaction, and often come across descriptions that make me wonder whether I've had it wrong all along. Some of these sources would seem to be quite authoritative, such as a translator's footnote to Copernicus , in which it is stated that the angular extent of a superior planet's retrograde motion observed from Earth is defined by the tangents to the Earth's orbit that pass through the planet: While these tangents certainly bound the angular extent of retrograde motion — in fact, they define the retrograde (and direct) motion of an unmoving planet (since they correspond to the maximum parallax for the planet seen from Earth) — isn't the actual extent of retrograde motion smaller, for the reasons stated above?
