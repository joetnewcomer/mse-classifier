3064281,Manipulating this $\frac{x-y}{z-y}$ to $1+\frac{x-z}{z-y}$,"There is probably a very easy explanation for this that is lost on me. Came across a formula that was manipulated into another form and it was presented as a given, so I am trying to figure out how that was done. Original: $\frac{x-y}{z-y}=1+\frac{x-z}{z-y}$ So I began to break it down: $\frac{x-y}{z-y}=\frac{x}{z-y}-\frac{y}{z-y}$ $\frac{x-y}{z-y}=\frac{x}{z-y}-(\frac{z}{z-y}-\frac{y}{y})$ <-- maybe this is wrong, but it works and I don't know why. Opening up the bracket: $\frac{x-y}{z-y}=\frac{x}{z-y}-\frac{z}{z-y}+1$ $\frac{x-y}{z-y}=1+\frac{x-z}{z-y}$ As I typed through all this, I see that $\frac{y}{z-y}=\frac{z}{z-y}-1$ is just true, and I get it when I simplify.

 \nabla_X Y =\overline{\nabla}_X Y -\langle\langle X,Y\rangle\rangle P,

I know that the normal vector to a point $p=(p_0,p_1,\dots,p_n)\in\mathbb{H}^n$ is $(-p_0,p_1,\dots,p_n)$ and also that ( $\langle, \rangle$ is the usual product): $$
\nabla_X Y =\overline{\nabla}_X Y -\langle \overline{\nabla}_XY,N\rangle N.
$$ Since $\langle \overline{\nabla}_XY,N\rangle=X(\langle Y,N\rangle)-\langle Y,\overline{\nabla}_X N\rangle=-\langle Y,\overline{\nabla}_X N\rangle$ . Now $\overline{\nabla}_X N=\sum X(N_i)\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}=X'$ , where $X'$ is $X$ , but with a change of sign in the first coordinate. Now $\langle Y,\overline{\nabla}_X N\rangle=\langle Y,X'\rangle=\langle \langle Y,X \rangle\rangle$ .

I arrived at $\frac{3\sqrt[4]{2x^6}}{2x^4}$ . I cannot tell if this is right and that the provided solution is just a further simplification of where I've gotten to, or if I'm off track entirely. Here is my working: $\sqrt[4]{\frac{162x^6}{16x^4}}$ = $\frac{\sqrt[4]{162x^6}}{\sqrt[4]{16x^4}}$ Denominator: $\sqrt[4]{16x^4}$ I think can be simplified to $2x^4$ since $2^4$ = 16 Numerator: $\sqrt[4]{162x^6}$ I was able to simplify (or over complicate) to $3\sqrt[4]{2}\sqrt[4]{x^6}$ since: $\sqrt[4]{162x^6}$ = $\sqrt[4]{81}$ * $\sqrt[4]{2}$ * $\sqrt[4]{x^6}$ = $3 * \sqrt[4]{2} * \sqrt[4]{x^6}$ Thus I got: $\frac{3\sqrt[4]{2}\sqrt[4]{x^6}}{2x^4}$ which I think is equal to $\frac{3\sqrt[4]{2x^6}}{2x^4}$ (product of the radicals in the numerator).

3064470,Projective-invariant differential operator,"This question has been cross-posted to MathOverflow . Suppose we want a differential operator $T$ acting on functions $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ such that \begin{align*}
&T(g) = 0 \Longleftrightarrow g \in G \\
&g \in G \Longrightarrow T(g \circ f) = T(f)
\end{align*} where $G = \text{Aff}(n, \mathbb{R})$ is the affine group . Consider the operator $$T(f) = (\nabla f)^{-1} \cdot \nabla \nabla f$$ where $\nabla f$ is the gradient of $f$ and $\nabla \nabla f$ is its Hessian . This seems to satisfy the criteria since $$\nabla \nabla f = 0 \Longleftrightarrow f(x) = A \cdot x + b$$ and \begin{align*}
T(A \cdot f + b)
&= (\nabla (A \cdot f + b))^{-1} \cdot \nabla \nabla (A \cdot f + b) \\
&= (\nabla A \cdot f)^{-1} \cdot \nabla \nabla A \cdot f \\
&= (A \cdot \nabla f)^{-1} \cdot \nabla A \cdot \nabla f \\
&= (\nabla f)^{-1} \cdot A^{-1} \cdot A \cdot \nabla \nabla f \\
&= (\nabla f)^{-1} \cdot \nabla \nabla f \\
&= T(f)
\end{align*} My question is this: Is there a similar operator that is invariant under the projective group $G = \text{PGL}(n, \mathbb{R})$ ? For $G = \text{PGL}(1,\mathbb{R})$ , an example is the Schwarzian derivative $$S(f) = \frac{f'''}{f'} - \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{f''}{f'}\right)^2$$ Projective differential geometry old and new by Ovsienko and Tabachnikov states in chapter 1.3 page 10 that $S(g) = 0$ iff $g$ is a projective transformation and $S(g \circ f) = S(f)$ if $g$ is a projective transformation. They also give a multidimensional generalization of the Schwarzian derivative in equation 7.1.6 page 191: $$L(f)_{ij}^k = \sum_\ell \frac{\partial^2 f^\ell}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} \frac{\partial x^k}{\partial f^\ell} - \frac{1}{n+1} \left(\delta_j^k \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} + \delta_i^k \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right) \log J_f$$ where $J_f = \det \frac{\partial f^i}{\partial x^j}$ is the Jacobian. However, Schwarps by Pizarro et al. states in section 3.3 page 97 that this ""cannot be used to ensure infinitesimally homographic warps as it also vanishes for other functions than homographies"" (are there examples?). Instead, they give a system of 2D Schwarzian equations that ""vanish if and only if the warp is a homography"" (page 94). These are given in section 4.2 equation 29 page 98: \begin{align*}
S_1[\eta] &= \eta^x_{uu} \eta^y_u - \eta^y_{uu} \eta^x_u \\
S_2[\eta] &= \eta^x_{vv} \eta^y_v - \eta^y_{vv} \eta^x_v \\
S_3[\eta] &= (\eta^x_{uu} \eta^y_v - \eta^y_{uu} \eta^x_v) + 2(\eta^x_{uv} \eta^y_u - \eta^y_{uv} \eta^x_u) \\
S_4[\eta] &= (\eta^x_{vv} \eta^y_u - \eta^y_{vv} \eta^x_u) + 2(\eta^x_{uv} \eta^y_v - \eta^y_{uv} \eta^x_v)
\end{align*} What is the geometric intuition behind these equations? Can they be stated more compactly/concisely? Also, how can we normalize them so that $S_i[\eta]$ is actually invariant under projective transformations of $\eta$ ? Finally, is there a compact expression for the $n$ -dimensional generalization of this derivative?","['differential-operators', 'projective-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'invariance', 'affine-geometry']"

In terms of R, what is the length of the smaller base of all the possible trapezoids as described, whose area is maximal? After some attempts at the problem, I managed to solve it using unit circle trigonometry, but I am curious if there are purely geometric solutions for this (which is what I was trying to find when I first attempted the problem). Here is my solution: Let $x$ be $\measuredangle AOD$ Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid Assume $0 < x < 90^\circ$ $$h = AO\sin x = R\sin x$$ $$AB = 2AO\cos x = 2R\cos x$$ Trapezoid area formula: $$\frac{AB + DC}{2} \cdot h $$ $$\downarrow$$ $$S_{(x)} = \frac{2R\cos x  + 2R}{2} \cdot R\sin x$$ From here, we find our function's derivative, get the $x$ for which there is a maxima, and plug it into our definition of AB to get it in terms of R, which would be AB = R.

3064544,Do general discrete subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ have fundamental domains in the upper half plane?,"Let $\Gamma$ be a congruence subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ .  The quotient $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb H$ has the structure of a one dimensional complex manifold, such that the quotient map $\pi: \mathbb H \rightarrow \Gamma \backslash \mathbb H$ is holomorphic.  There is a nice fundamental domain $D \subset \mathbb H$ coming from the usual fundamental domain for $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ which, up to some boundary identification, gives us a copy of $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb H$ inside $\mathbb H$ . The Borel measure $\mu = \frac{dx dy}{y^2}$ on $\mathbb H$ descends to a Borel measure $\overline{\mu}$ on $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb H$ which we may define using the fundamental domain: if $U \subset \Gamma \backslash \mathbb H$ is Borel, then we set $$\overline{\mu}(U) := \mu \bigg(\pi^{-1}(U) \cap D \bigg) \tag{1}$$ Now, assume $\Gamma$ is an arbitrary discrete subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ . Is there a canonical measure $\bar{\mu}$ on $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb H$ coming from $\mu = \frac{dx dy}{y^2}$ ? Does there always exist a fundamental domain $D$ for $\Gamma$ ?

For intuition, I'm thinking of $\mathbb R$ modulo the action of $\mathbb Z$ .  Up to boundary identification, $[0,1]$ is a fundamental domain for the action of $\mathbb Z$ on $\mathbb R$ .  For the Haar measure $\bar{\mu}$ on $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ , we can get it in two ways.  First, if $\pi: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb Z$ is the quotient map, we can measure subsets of $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ by pulling them back to $\mathbb R$ , intersecting them with $[0,1]$ , then measuring.  Second, $\bar{\mu}$ comes from the unique invariant nonvanishing $1$ -form on $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ which pulls back to the top form $dx$ on $\mathbb R$ giving the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R$ .","['measure-theory', 'number-theory', 'complex-analysis', 'modular-forms', 'differential-geometry']"

3064580,Rings with 'non-harmless' zero-divisors,"The following excerpt is from pp. 246–247 of Paolo Aluffi's Algebra: Chapter 0: 1.2. Prime and irreducible elements. Let $R$ be a (commutative) ring [with $1$ ], and let $a,b\in R$ . We say that $a$ divides $b$ , or that $a$ is a divisor of $b$ , or that $b$ is a multiple of $a$ , if $b\in(a)$ , that is $$
(\exists c\in R), \quad b = ac.
$$ We use the notation $a \mid b$ . Two elements $a,b$ are associates if $(a) = (b)$ , that is, if $a\mid b$ and $b\mid a$ . Lemma 1.5. Let $a,b$ be nonzero elements of an integral domain $R$ . Then $a$ and $b$ are associates if and only if $a = ub$ , for $u$ a unit in $R$ . [Proof omitted.] Incidentally, here the reader sees why it is convenient to restrict our attention to integral domains. This argument really shows that if $(a) = (b) \ne (0)$ in an integral domain, and $b = ca$ , then $c$ is necessarily a unit. Away from the comfortable environment of integral domains, even such harmless-looking statements may fail: in $\Bbb Z/6\Bbb Z$ , the classes $[2]_6,[4]_6$ of $2$ and $4$ are associates according to our definition, and $[4]_6 = [2]_6\cdot[2]_6$ , yet $[2]_6$ is not a unit. However, $[4]_6 = [5]_6\cdot [2]_6$ and $[5]_6$ is a unit, so this is not a counterexample to Lemma 1.5. In fact, Lemma 1.5 may fail over rings with 'non-harmless' zero-divisors (yes, there is such a notion) [emphasis added]. Since at this point, Aluffi does not say what such rings are called, I was hoping someone might know what type of rings Aluffi is referring to.

3064606,"""Fragmentation"" of a distribution (from paper)","I've been reading a paper by Robert Morris (""Sets, Scales and Rhythmic Cycles; A Classification of Talas in Indian Music"") and came across a formula that I've found a bit tricky. He is referring to the ""fragmentation"" of a distribution and includes the formula below without derivation or reference. I'm pretty new to statistics, so this may be a standard formula that I'm just unaware of. However, I haven't been able to find it in the same format online. One feature for use in ordering talas is fragmentation. We have
  already grouped talas into partition classes. All talas in a
  particular partition class have the same fragmentation. We use the
  partition P as the input to a function that yields the fragmentation
  of the partition. Fragmentation varies between 0 and 1 and is a
  measure of the uniformity of a distribution—the higher the
  fragmentation, the more even the distribution. We calculate the
  fragmentation of a partition of the number N into z parts using the
  following formula...: $FRAG(P)=1 - \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{z}{PAIRS(p_{k})}}{PAIRS(N)}$ where $PAIRS(s)=\frac{{s^2}-s}{2} \:, \: P=\{{p_{1},p_{2}, p_{3}},...p_{z}\},\\ N = sum(P), and \: z = card(p) . $ I found the formula to be much more readable in this format: $Let \: P = \{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3},..., p_{z}\}, \: z = card(P),\: and \: N = sum(P).\\
FRAG(P)=1- \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{z} \frac{p_{k}^{2}-p_{k}}{2}}{\frac{N^{2}-N}{2}}=1-2\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{z}\frac{p_{k}^2-p_{k}}{2}}{N^2-N}$ The author uses the formula with the example $P=\{2, 2, 4\} \rightarrow N = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8$ and $z = 3.$ This returns $FRAG(P)=1-2(\frac{8}{56})=0.714285714...$ Does this formula (or a similar one) have a name?

3064768,"If $f(x)=\int_{x-1}^x f(s)ds$, is $f$ constant? Periodic?","I was thinking of periodic functions, and in particular the following type of condition: If a function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ always ""tends to its average"", then it should be periodic. To make things more formal, by ""tending to the average"" we could say something like $f(x)=\int_{x-1}^x f(s)ds$ . This is only the average depending on a previous time interval of length $1$ , but it seems an interesting enough property. However, the only type of functions which I could find that satisfies this property are the constant ones! Question: If $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous (or more generaly measurable) and $f(x)=\int_{x-1}^x f(s)ds$ for (almost) every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ , then is $f$ constant (a.e.)? Periodic (a.e.)? Here is a first try for $C^1$ functions (see edit below!): If $f$ is $C^1$ and $x$ is fixed, we can use Taylor expansion $f(s)=f(x)+O(s-x)$ (and similarly for $x-1$ ) to obtain \begin{align*}
f(x+t)-f(x)&=\int_x^{x+t}f(s)ds-\int_{x-1}^{x-1+t}f(s)ds\\
&=\int_x^{x+t}f(x)+O(s-x)ds-\int_{x-1}^{x-1+t}f(x-1)+O(s-x+1)ds\\
&=t(f(x)-f(x-1))+O(t^2),
\end{align*} so $f'(x)=f(x)-f(x-1)$ . This is obviously true if $f$ is constant, but the converse is not clear to me at the moment. Edit : From a comment and answer below, the equation $f'(x)=f(x)-f(x-1)$ has non-periodic solutions on $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Z}$ , so this should not be the way to go for $C^1$ functions. However, even in this case it is not clear that any solution of this equation will satisfy $f(x)=\int_{x-1}^x f(s)ds$ , which is the question: All I can obtain, in principle, is $f(x)-f(x-1)=\int_x^{x-1}f(s)ds-\int_{x-2}^{x-1}f(s)ds$ .","['integration', 'calculus', 'average', 'recreational-mathematics']"
3064771,"Need Help : Proving polynomials are continuous, without circular reasoning","I know there are a lot of answers regarding continuity of polynomials. But, this question is different. We need to have $ \lim_{x\to a} {x^n} = a^n$ , $n \in N$ , to be able to prove that polynomials are continuous. This fact is derived from the product rule (or may be it can't be, which is my question). The product rule is proved using square roots, so it assumes the existence of square roots.  The fact that For every non negative number $x$ , it's $n^{th}$ root exists, i.e. $x^n$ is invertible, assumes the continuity of $x^n$ because this is proven using Intermediate value Theorem. Bam - Circular reasoning ! Or am I Wrong ? 
Here's the only proof of product rule which I know :
Assume $ \lim_{x\to a} {f(x)} = L$ and $ \lim_{x\to a} {g(x)} = K$ Let $ϵ > 0$ be any positive number
Hence, $∃\delta_1> 0 ∶ 0<|x-a|<δ_1⟹|f(x)-L|<\sqrt{\epsilon}$ And $∃δ_2>0 ∶ 0<|x-a|<δ_2 ⟹ |g(x)-K|<\sqrt{\epsilon}$ Let $δ=\min\{δ_1,δ_2\}$ Hence, $0<|x-a|<δ$ ⟹ $|(f(x)-L)(g(x)-K)-0|<\sqrt{\epsilon} \sqrt{\epsilon} = ϵ$ Hence, $\lim_{x \to a} {(f(x)-L)(g(x)-K)} = 0$ ⟹ $\lim_{x \to a} {(f(x)g(x)-Kf(x)-Lg(x)+KL)} = 0$ And then the result follows. 
Even if we use $\epsilon$ in place of $√ϵ$ , we end up with $0<|x-a|<δ⟹|(f(x)-L)(g(x)-K)-0|<\epsilon\cdot \epsilon = ϵ^2$ , and then we have to prove that the range of $\epsilon^2$ is $[0,\infty]$ , which amounts to proving that for each number in $[0,\infty]$ , a corresponding square root exists.","['epsilon-delta', 'limits', 'continuity', 'real-analysis']"

I'm two days thinking about the exercise below. The book that proposes this exercise gives no hint of how to solve it. And it seems to me that there is nothing in the text of the book that can help. This exercise is in a chapter preceding the chapter on the Stokes' theorem ( $\int_{\partial M} \omega = \int_{M} d\omega $ ). So I am trying a solution that does not use Stokes' theorem. Exercise. For every differential form of class $C^k$ in  sphere $S^m$ there exists a differential $r$ -form $\Omega$ of class $C^k$ in $\mathbb{R}^{m + 1}-\{0\}$ such that $\Omega|_{S^m} = \omega $ . If $m>1$ , conclude that every closed differential form of degree $1$ in the sphere $S^m$ is the differential of a function $f:S^m \to \mathbb{R}$ . In particular, any closed form of degree $1$ in $S^m$ ( $m>1$ ) must be nullified by at least two points. My job. Let $\omega$ be a differential form of class $C^k$ and degree $r$ in sphere $$S^m = \{(x_1,\ldots, x_{m + 1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{m + 1}: x_1^2 +\ldots + x_{m + 1}^2 = 1\}.$$ Let us obtain a differential form $ \Omega $ of class $ C^k $ and degree $ r $ in $ \mathbb{R}^{m + 1}$ such that $\Omega|_{S^m}=\omega$ . Let $ x \in \mathbb{R}^{m+1}-\{0\}$ be fixed. Given any other vector $ v \in \mathbb{R}^m$ there exists a unique vector $P_x(v)$ perpendicular to $x$ such that $$
v=c_v\cdot x + P_x(v)
$$ where $ c_v $ is a constant that depends on $ v $ . Note that $P_x(v)\in T_xS^m$ . Since the projection $ P_x $ is a linear application we can define $$
\Omega(x)(v_1,\ldots,v_r)=\omega({x}/{|x|})(P_x(v_1),\ldots,P_x(v_r)).
$$ I believe that this first part of the exercise I did correctly.Now let's go to the second part of the exercise which is proof that $ \omega $ is exact. For every point $ x $ of the sphere $ S^m $ there exists a parametrization $\varphi: \overline{U} \to \tilde{U} $ with $x = \varphi (u)$ from which we can obtain the base $\left\{\frac{\partial\varphi(u)}{\partial u_1},\ldots,\frac{\partial\varphi(u)}{\partial u_m}  \right\}$ of $ T_xS ^ m $ and its dual base $\{du_1,\ldots, du_m\}$ of $ (T_xS^m)^\ast $ . In addition, there are coordinate functions $a_j^{\varphi}:\overline{U}\to \mathbb{R}$ such that $$
\omega(x)(v) = a_1^{\varphi}(u) du_1\cdot v+\ldots+ a_m^{\varphi} du_m\cdot v
$$ for all $x=\varphi(u)\in \tilde{U}$ and all $v\in T_xS^m$ . On the assumption that $ \omega $ is closed we have $$
d\omega(x)(v_1,v_2) =\sum_{i<j} \left(\frac{\partial a_j^{\varphi}}{\partial u_i}(u)-\frac{\partial a_i^{\varphi}}{\partial u_j}(u) \right)  du_i\wedge du_j ( v_1,v_2)=0
$$ for all $x=\varphi(u)\in \tilde{U}$ and all $v_1,v_2\in T_xS^m$ . This means that for every point $x\in S^m$ there is a parametrization $\varphi $ , as $\varphi(u)=x$ for some $u \in \overline{U} $ , which provides coordinate functions $a_j^{\varphi}:\overline{U}\to\mathbb{R}$ of $ \omega $ that satisfies for all $i<j$ in $\{1,\ldots,m\}$ $$
\frac{\partial a_j^{\varphi}}{\partial u_i}(u)-\frac{\partial a_i^{\varphi}}{\partial u_j}(u)=0
$$ for all $u\in \overline{U}$ . I think of using the coordinate functions $a_i^{\varphi}$ to define a vector field in $\overline{U}$ or $\tilde{U}$ and achieve some geometric result with line integrals.

I have made a table with the values of the bush height every night and every day, basis the rules.
The ant starts with 1000 cm height above and 0 cm below. Then it advances by 10 cm so it has 990 cm above and 10 cm below. Total height is (still) 1000 cm.
In the morning, the height of the bush is proportionally extended by 5% so the up value is now $990*(5/1000)+990 = 1039.5$ and the down is $10*(5/1000)+10 = 10.5$ Total height is of course increased by 50 cm.
Then at night, first value is decreased by 10 and second is increased by 10. Height remains the same.
We continue this way and have the following values: Bush up (cm)    Bush down (cm)  Total Initially   1000    0   1000 1st night   990 10  1000 1st day     1039,5  10,5    1050 2nd night   1029,5  20,5    1050 2nd day     1078,52381  21,47619048 1100 3rd night   1068,52381  31,47619048 1100 3rd day     1117,093074 32,90692641 1150 4th night   1107,093074 42,90692641 1150 4th day     1155,227555 44,77244495 1200 5th night   1145,227555 54,77244495 1200 We continue this way and now we make a graph of the 3 columns, bush up, bush down and Total.

3065516,"Zero conditional mean, and is regression estimating population regression function?","I am relearning econometrics to get a better understanding of it, and to clear the confusions when I had in college. Using the simple regression model, we have a population model equation as: $$ y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + u\tag{1}$$ In the SLR assumption 3, we have the zero conditional mean assumption . Are we assuming this statement because in reality, y can take many values given x taking a single value, so that we hope, given x, the expected value of y is center around E[y|x], is this understanding of SLR Assumption 3 correct ? This means, if we take the expected value of equation (1) conditioned on x: $$ E[y|x] = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + E[u|x]\tag{2}$$ Because any deviation can be absorbed by the intercept item, we lose nothing by assuming E[u] = 0. By assuming SLR 3 E[u|x] = E[u] = 0, we are implying that: $$ E[u|x] =\sum{}u P_{u|x}(u) = \sum{}u\dfrac{P_{u,x}(u,x)}{P_{x}(x)}=\sum{}u\dfrac{P_{u}(u)P_{x}(x)}{P_{x}(x)} = \sum{}uP_{u}(u) = E[u]\tag{3}$$ In order to get the above equation, we are implying that x and u are independent of each other, so we are also implying that from the covariance formula of x and u, we can get the following equation E[ux] = E[u] = 0: $$ Cov(u, x) = E[ux] - E[u]E[x] = E[ux] - 0 = E[u]E[x] = 0 \tag{4}$$ Thus: $$ E[ux] = 0 \tag{5}$$ And, because of this implied uncorrelated relationship between u and x, the equation (2) above can be viewed as when E[u|x] = 0, so we have the population regression function by taking expectation conditioned on x for equation (1), as: $$ E[y|x] = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x \tag{6}$$ This is a linear relationship between x and expected value of y, by the change of 1 unit in x leads to beta1 unit change in y. And the distribution of y is centered at E[y|x]. So my question is that, when we are estimating using OLS, is the sample regression function estimating the population model equation (1) or estimating the population regression function equation (6) and why? Also, in multiple regression function, we also assume zero conditional mean as: $$ E[u|x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3},...,x_{k}] = 0 $$ Here are we saying that u is uncorrelated with the group of (x1,...xk), or can we say that u is uncorrelated with each of xi respectively, for i = 1,...,k?

Here is what I did: I calculated $\frac{\partial}{\partial r}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}$ in terms of $r,$ $\theta,$ $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}.$ This gave me a system of linear equations which I wrote as $$\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \\\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\\ -r\sin\theta & r\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \\\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\end{pmatrix}.$$ I inverted to get $$\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \\\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{r}\begin{pmatrix}r\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\\ r\sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \\\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\end{pmatrix},$$ and then I simply wrote \begin{align}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)\\ &= \left(\cos\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial r}-\frac{1}{r}\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right)\left(\cos\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial r}-\frac{1}{r}\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right)\\ &= \cos\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\cos\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial r}-\frac{1}{r}\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right) -\frac{1}{r}\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\cos\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial r}-\frac{1}{r}\sin\theta\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right)\\ &= \cos^2\theta \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} - \frac{2}{r}\sin\theta\cos\theta\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r
\partial\theta} +\frac{1}{r^2}\sin^2\theta\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}.\end{align} I similarly got $$\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} = \sin^2\theta \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + \frac{2}{r}\sin\theta\cos\theta\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r
\partial\theta} +\frac{1}{r^2}\cos^2\theta\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}.$$ Adding the two yields $$\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}+\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2},$$ which Spivak says is correct. Explicitly, here are my questions: In my solution, when I found $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2},$ I simply ""multiplied"" the expressions in the second line of the large aligned equation (treating multiplication of the partial operators as composition). Why am I allowed to do this? Why does the expression on the left not act on the thing on the right, forcing me to do the product rule and other nonsense to get the answer? My original idea was just to compute the Laplacian using the chain rule. That is, write $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \frac{\partial r}{\partial x}$ and compute $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$ from there. My problem with this is that I keep getting confused about in which variables I should be writing everything, and how the partial derivative operators act on these other expressions. For example, I compute $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \frac{\partial r}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} - \frac{y}{x^2+y^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta},$ but then I don't know where to go. Help understanding this method would be greatly appreciated. If anything is unclear let me know and I'll make the necessary edits.","['partial-derivative', 'polar-coordinates', 'derivatives']"

Put another way, can you prove the following: For all primes $p$ , and all integers $0 \le m <p$ , there exists $n\in\Bbb{Z}$ with $1\le n < p$ such that $np+m$ is prime. I think I have a proof sketch but it's fiddly and I don't want to reinvent the wheel (likely badly). To illustrate, here's the result checked for $p = 5$ : Arithmetic progressions with gaps $5$ from $5$ to $24$ ( $p$ to $p^2-1$ ): $\boldsymbol{5},10,15,20$ $6,\boldsymbol{11},16,21$ $\boldsymbol{7},12,\boldsymbol{17},22$ $8,\boldsymbol{13},18,\boldsymbol{23}$ $9,14,\boldsymbol{19},24$ As you can see, in bold , all of these arithmetic progressions have at least one prime. If one of these sequences didn't have a prime the theorem would be disproven for $p = 5$ . Note that proving that every arithmetic progression of gap $p$ and length $(p-1)$ has at least one number coprime to $(p-1)!$ should also prove the above, and indeed is more general, as if $n$ is coprime to $(p-1)!$ and is less than $p^2$ then it has to be prime.","['number-theory', 'prime-gaps', 'elementary-number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"

This integral popped up when I was trying to find the average difference of two points on a circle, where these points are assumed to be drawn independently from a von Mises distribution. It was noted by Robert Israel that this integral can be reduced to $$ \int_0^\pi t I_0(2\kappa \cos(t/2)) \; dt = \frac{\pi^2}{2} I_0(\kappa)^2 - 4 \sum_{r=0}^\infty \frac{I_{2r+1}(\kappa)^2}{(2r+1)^2} \; .$$ So I was wondering, if we can further simplify  this expression, or to stated more clearly: Is there a closed formula for the following sum of modified Bessel functions of the first kind? $$\sum_{r=0}^\infty \frac{I_{2r+1}(\kappa)^2}{(2r+1)^2}$$ A lot of remarkable identities in terms of infinite sums of Bessel functions are known. E.g. Abramowitz and Stegun list in §9.6.33ff. a few of them, like: $$\begin{align}
1        &= I_0(z) + 2\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{r}I_{2r}(z) \\
e^z      &= I_0(z) + 2\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} I_{r}(z) \\
\cosh{z} &= I_0(z) + 2\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} I_{2r}(z) \\
\end{align}$$ WolframResearch lists another bunch of infinite series identities.
Also, Neumann's addition theorem seems to work wonders <1> <2> <3> . Regarding the integral itself, Gradshteyn and Ryzhik mention in 6.519.1 that $$\int_0^{\pi/2} J_{2r}(2\kappa\cos{t}) = \frac{\pi}{2} J_r^2(\kappa) \; ,$$ where $J_r(x) = i^rI_r(-ix)$ . So there might be a chance to expect something along this line. Going back to the original problem "" What is the expected value of a distribution $\Delta$ with the following density function "" $$f_{\Delta}(t) := \frac{I_0 \left( 2\kappa \cos{\frac{t}{2}} \right)}{\pi I^2_0(\kappa)} \; ,$$ a straightforward integration leads to the integral mentioned above. Using some probability theory voodoo we can make use of the fact that $$\mathbb{E}[\Delta] = -i \varphi'_{\Delta}(0) 
= -i \left[\frac{d}{d\omega} 
\mathcal{F}(f_{\Delta})(\omega)
\right] \Bigg|_{\omega=0} 
= -i \left[\frac{d}{d\omega} 
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{it\omega}f_{\Delta}(t) dt 
\right] \Bigg|_{\omega=0} $$ where $\varphi_{\Delta}$ is the characteristic function of $f_{\Delta}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ the (properly scaled) Fourier transform. Now with $\varphi(-\omega) = \overline{\varphi(\omega)}$ , we could further rewrite $$\mathbb{E}[\Delta] = -i\varphi'_{\Delta}(0)

The promising part about this approach is that the Fourier transform pops up, which might leave some room for the harmonic analysis people among you to do your magic.","['bessel-functions', 'definite-integrals', 'closed-form', 'sequences-and-series']"
3066000,"How to solve for $\theta$ in terms of $a,b,c$ in this expression?","I am trying to design a cam profile like in the above image. There are 2 equations I have come up with that define variable ""c"". The problem, however, is that variables a, b & c are known values and it is angle $\theta$ that I need to know. The 2 arcs on either end of the straight line are equal. The radius of the arcs and the angle $\theta$ change when any of the variables are changed. The 2 equations I have so far: $c = \frac{2a}{\sin \theta}(1-\cos \theta)+\frac{b.\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} $ $c = 2 \left[ \frac{a}{\sin \theta} - \sqrt{ \left( \frac{a}{\sin \theta} \right)^2 - a^2}\, \right] + \frac {b.\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} $ I can't for the life of me manage to rearrange the equation to make $\theta$ the subject! If anyone is an algebra whiz, any help would be much appreciated! Cheers. EDIT Ok, so after a bit of geometric shenanigans, I have come up with some different equations to help solve this but and still struggling to rearrange it. (However, I had to replace $\theta$ with $x$ as I couldn't get $\theta$ to work with the program I drew this with!) By drawing a chord for the arc, we can show that the angle of the chord is half that of the slope. What I really need to find is the length of either $e$ or $d$ , where $d + e = \frac{c}{2}$ Using the half angle formula I get: $\tan x = \frac{2 \tan \frac{x}{2} }{1 - \tan^2 \frac{x}{2}}$ Which can be written as: $\frac{c-2e}{b} = \frac{\frac{2e}{a}}{1-\frac{e^2}{a^2}} $ Simplifying to: $\frac{c-2e}{b} = \frac{2ae}{a^2-e^2}$ My problem now, is that I can't simplify it to get $e$ on its own! If anyone has any ideas, that would be awesome!","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"
3066012,Finding irrational entries such that the determinant will never be zero,"Context. The main goal is to find whether or not a subspace of $\mathbb R^5$ of dimension $3$ intersects a rational subspace of dimension $2$ . By rational subspace, we mean a subspace of $\mathbb R^5$ which admits a rational basis ( i.e. a basis formed with vectors with rational entries). This is what motivates this question. The question. Let $Y_1,Y_2,Y_3$ be three vectors of $\mathbb R^5$ such that all the coordinates of the $Y_i$ are in $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt 2,\sqrt 3,\sqrt 6),$$ i.e. the coordinates of the $Y_i$ are of the form $$a+b\sqrt 2+c\sqrt 3+d\sqrt 6,\qquad a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Q.$$ Let $X_1,X_2\in\mathbb Q^5$ be two vectors with rational entries such that $(X_1,X_2)$ is free over $\mathbb R$ . Does there exist such $(Y_1,Y_2,Y_3)$ such that for all such $(X_1,X_2)$ , the matrix $M\in\mathrm M_5(\mathbb R)$ with columns $Y_1,Y_2,Y_3,X_1,X_2$ , i.e. $$M:=(Y_1\vert Y_2\vert Y_3\vert X_1\vert X_2),$$ satisfies $$\det M\ne 0\quad ?$$ Remarks. I have tried many choices of vectors $Y_1,Y_2,Y_3$ , but it always result in a system of four rational equations that I can not solve. The goal would be to show that the system has no rational solution. Any ideas or references which would be related to this matter would be of great help.","['determinant', 'vector-spaces', 'diophantine-equations', 'linear-algebra', 'rational-numbers']"
3066037,Let A be a denumerable subset of an uncountable set X. Prove that X/A is uncountable,"I'd like to know if my proof is correct: Assume $A$ is denumerable and and $A\subseteq X$ Assume X is uncountable
(X uncountable means X is not finite and X is not denumerable) $X=(X\backslash A) \cup (X \cap A)=(X\backslash A)\cup A$ (as $A \subseteq X$ ) Therefore $X$ is uncountable $\implies (X\backslash A) \cup (X \cap A)$ uncountable. Now using the Theorem: If A and B are denumerable sets then $A\cup B$ is denumerable.
The contrapositive of this statement is: If $A\cup B$ is not denumerable then A is not denumerable or B is not denumerable. Now applying the contrapositive to what we have so far $(X\backslash A) \cup A)$ uncountable(not denumerable) $\implies(X\backslash A)$ uncountable or $A$ is uncountable. (by the contrapositive of the theorem) By assumption A is denumerable and therefore countable hence X\A is uncountable as required.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

Then is $K$ compact in the space $\mathscr{C}[0,1]$ ? Typically how do we characterize the compact spaces in the space of continuous functions? Will Heine-Borel property work here? I think Heine-Borel would work, as $[0,1]$ is a compact Hausdorff space. Then, by using a function similar to spikes, or, somewhat like Dirac-Delta function, I think the space $K$ is not compact. Is my argument true? Any hints? Thanks beforehand.","['general-topology', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

E[f(x,y)] = \int \int f(x,y) P_{XY}(x,y) \ dx \ dy

E[g(x)] = \int g(x) P_{X}(x) \ dx

3066203,A convergent sequence has precisely one accumulation point,"As a step in a proof I've been trying to show that convergence of a sequence implies it must have precisely one accumulation point. This is the definition we use for an accumulation point Let $S$ be a set of real numbers. A real number is an accumulation point $s_0$ of $S$ if and only if for any $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists at least one point $t$ of $S$ such that $0 < |t-s_0| < \epsilon$ . I wish to prove: Lemma: A convergent sequence has precisely one accumulation point. My thoughts: Since the limit of the sequence exists we know that the set cannot have 2 accumulation points or more, we will show by contradiction. If we would have multiple accumulation points the limit does not exist because we can never get arbitrarily close to a single point (within ϵ), because there exist certain subsequences that each get arbitrarily close to at least two accumulation points, which determine the minimum distance a sequence can be from an accumulation point (so we get a lower bound and therefore we do not get convergence). There must be precisely one accumulation point. I do not know how to make this more precise of a statement, there are a lot of words and it's not really structured. I'm looking for some help making a more rigourous argument.","['limits', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
