610500,Four equations with three variables!,"I have these four equations: $$\left\{\begin{matrix}
A_1 = A_c -D \theta cos(\phi)\\ 
A_2 = A_c -D \theta cos(\phi-\pi/2)\\ 
A_3 = A_c -D \theta cos(\phi-\pi)\\ 
A_4 = A_c -D \theta cos(\phi-3\pi/2)
\end{matrix}\right.$$ Variables $A_1$ to $A_4$ are given, D is a constant, and Variables $A_c$, $\theta$, and $\phi$ are unknown. I need to find $\frac{d \theta}{d A_1}$ to $\frac{d \theta}{d A_4}$, but I have some problems. What I tried was that I used three of these equations and derived $\theta$, $\phi$, and $A_c$, and then differentiated $\theta$ with respect to $A_i$ separately, but I am not sure if this is correct or not. The thing is that variables $A_i$ are related. This means that if variable $A_1$ changes, at least one of the variables $A_2$ to $A_4$ will also change as there is this relation between the $A_i$ and $A_c$ parameters: $A_1+A_2+A_3+A_4=4 A_c$ I also get different results when I use three other set of these four equations to derive the parameters. So how can I study the changes of variables $\theta$ and $\phi$ due to changes in variables $A_1$ to $A_4$. Edit:
If I derive variable $\theta$ from the first three equations listed above, I'll have:
$$\theta=\frac{\sqrt{2}\, \sqrt{{\mathrm{A1}}^2 - 2\, \mathrm{A1}\, \mathrm{A2} + 2\, {\mathrm{A2}}^2 - 2\, \mathrm{A2}\, \mathrm{A3} + {\mathrm{A3}}^2}}{2\, R}$$ and if I derive variable $\theta$ from the first, second and fourth equations, I'll have: $$\theta=\frac{\sqrt{2}\, \sqrt{2\, {\mathrm{A1}}^2 - 2\, \mathrm{A1}\, \mathrm{A2} - 2\, \mathrm{A1}\, \mathrm{A4} + {\mathrm{A2}}^2 + {\mathrm{A4}}^2}}{2\, R}$$ ,and finally I use $\theta$ derived by Ross Millikan in the answer below which is: $$\theta=\frac{\sqrt{{\left(\mathrm{A1} - \mathrm{A3}\right)}^2 + {\left(\mathrm{A2} - \mathrm{A4}\right)}^2}}{2\, R}$$ As you notice, the first two solutions do not involve all $A_1$ to $A_4$.
All of these solution calculates correct value for $\theta$, but when I differentiate them with respect to $A_1$, you will see different results. This is how I do this: For $\theta=45 \deg$ and $\phi=0$, I first calculated all $A_1$ to $A_4$ parameters using the four equation in the begining. Now if I use these $A_1$ to $A_4$ parameters in the above solutions for $\theta$, they all would calculate correct $\theta$, but when I differentiate above solutions for $\theta$, and then use $A_1$ to $A_4$ parameters, they determines values of -0.1667, -0.3333, and -0.1667, respectively. And if I repeat this procedure for $\theta=45 \deg$ and $\phi=45 \deg$, then the results would be 0.0, -0.2357, and -0.1179. My understanding is that the correct one is the third solution that involves all of the $A_1$ to $A_4$ parameters, but then I don't know what is logically wrong with others or how I can relate the two other solutions to the correct one?","['multivariable-calculus', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
610506,convergence of convolutions and approximation of unity,"Let $\phi : \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be an integrable function with  $\int \phi(x)dx = 1$.

$f ∗ \phi_\delta(x)\rightarrow f(x)$ as $\delta\rightarrow 0$ for every $x\in\mathbb{R}$. My idea was to apply the following THM:
if $\phi_n$ is an approximation of unity, then for $f:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ continuous: $\phi_n∗ f\rightarrow f$ uniformly on compact sets. but our definition of approximation of unity requires the fact that $\phi$ has a compact support. Any idea or help?

610551,Characterization of closure of set with open neighborhoods,"I am trying to prove the following proposition: Let $X$ be a topological space, and $S$ a subset of $X$. then, an element $x$ of $X$ belongs to $\bar{S}$ (the closure of $S$) iff every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $S$. This is at page two of a primer on topological space and the definitions I should use to establish the result are those (standard) of the closure of a set and of an interior, plus - obviously - the definition of an open neighborhood of an element $x$ of the topological space. In particular the last is given by the following: an open subset of $X$ that contains an element $x$ of $X$ is called an open neighborhood of $x$. Approaching the problem, I frame it in the following way: $ \forall x \in (X,\tau) ( x \in \bar{S} \Longleftrightarrow \forall A \in \tau (x \in A \Rightarrow A \cap S \neq \emptyset))$ My problems start with the ""only if"" condition [$\Longrightarrow$]. I assume that $x \in \bar{S}$ and that there is an open neighborhood $A^*$  of $x$ such that $A^* \cap S = \emptyset$ proceeding by contradiction. This implies that $x \not \in S$ and $x \in A^* \subseteq X\setminus S $. Now, here I stop, because I don't see how to relate this with the definition of $\bar S$, that is $\bar S := \bigcap \{C: S \subseteq C \wedge X \setminus C \in \tau \}$ Beyond all of this, in terms of intuition, it seems to me that the all problem moves around the fact if $S$ is or not open, but I am not sure.

However, to prove this, he used a total, finitely-additive, isometry-invariant extension of Lebesgue Measure, which he calls a Banach measure.

610814,Variants of the bump function.,"The title of this question isn't really clear because of the 150 char limit. What I actually want to ask is this: If I would have a bump function for $-1 < x < 1$ and I would have some variants of it (a little wider or smaller and higher or lower), how does the bump function have to be designed so I can determine when it is equal or higher than the other function(exponential decay)? This explains a little what a bump function is. The function I'm looking for is does not have to look like that exactly, but at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$, the slope has to be $0$. I've been trying to create some functions that make a bump between $-1$ and $1$, but when I have a sum of some of those, I can't solve for $x$. What I mean by a sum of variants is this. Let the bump represent the energy level of a light flash. So, if $y = e\times \operatorname{exp}\left(-\frac{1}{1-x^2}\right)$, $x$ represents time and $y$ represents the energy level. If you would have some device with a light sensor which has to do something if at some moment the light exceeds a value, it has constantly have to check if its input (sum of energy levels) is more than some value. So a bump function represents a flash of light, but the flashes are not the same, they don't start at the same time, they differ in duration and they might differ in intensity. So if I would have three flashes, the first starts at $4$, its duration is $2.5$, and it is $1.1$ times intense as the standard flash. For the second: start $2$, duration $6$, intensity $0.5$. And for the third: start $5$, duration $2$, intensity $3$. The formulas would then be $$y = 1.1\times e\times \operatorname{exp}\left( -\frac{1}{1-(\frac{x-5}{1.25})^2}\right)$$
$$y = 0.5\times e\times \operatorname{exp}\left( -\frac{1}{1-(\frac{x-3}{3})^2}\right)$$ $$y = 3\times e\times \operatorname{exp}\left( -\frac{1}{1-(x-6)^2}\right)$$ and the formulas for the sum of those flashes would be $$y = 0.5\times e\times \operatorname{exp}\left( -\frac{1}{1-(\frac{x-3}{3})^2}\right)$$ for $2 < x < 4$ and for $7 < x < 8$, $$y = 0.5\times e\times \operatorname{exp}\left( -\frac{1}{1-(\frac{x-3}{3})^2}\right) + 1.1\times e\times \operatorname{exp}\left( -\frac{1}{1-(\frac{x-5}{1.25})^2}\right)$$

610862,(solution verification) the series $\sum z^{n!}$ has the unit circle as a natural boundary,"I've tried to solve the following problem from Ahlfors' complex analysis text: If a function element $(f,\Omega)$ has no direct analytic continuations other than the ones obtained by restricting $f$ to a smaller region, then the boundary of $\Omega$ is called a natural boundary for $f$. Prove that the series
  $\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{n!}$ has the unit circle as a natural boundary. Hint: Show that the function tends to infinity on every radius whose argument is a rational multiple of $\pi$. My attempt: Let $q \in \mathbb Q$ be a rational number, with reduced form $a/b$ where $a \in \mathbb Z,b \in \mathbb N$. For $r<1$ we have $$f\left(r e^{i q \pi}\right)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty r^{n!} e^{i q n! \pi}= \sum_{n=0}^{b+1} r^{n!} e^{i q n! \pi}+\sum_{n=b+2}^\infty r^{n!} e^{i \frac{a}{b} n! \pi}  $$ In the last sum we have $e^{i \frac{a}{b} n! \pi}=1$ for $n \geq b+2$, since the exponent is an even multiple of $\pi i$. Thus using the reverse triangle inequality $$\left|f \left( r e^{i q \pi} \right) \right|=\left|\sum_{n=0}^{b+1} r^{n!} e^{i q n! \pi}+\sum_{n=b+2}^\infty r^{n!} \right| \geq \left| \sum_{n=b+2}^\infty r^{n!}- \left| \sum_{n=0}^{b+1} r^{n!} e^{i q n! \pi} \right| \right|.$$ Taking $r$ sufficiently close to $1$ the series $\sum_{n=b+2}^\infty r^{n!}$ can be made arbitrarily large. Indeed, if $r \geq \sqrt[N!]{1/2}$ with $N$ large the series contains at least $N-b-1$ terms which are $\geq 1/2$. It follows that for $r$ sufficiently close to $1$ the sum $\sum_{n=b+2}^\infty r^{n!}$ can be made larger than 
$$M:= \max_{r \in [0,1]} \left|  \sum_{n=0}^{b+1} r^{n!} e^{i q n! \pi} \right|<\infty ,$$ making the external absolute value redundant. For all such sufficiently close numbers $r$ we have $$\left| f \left( r e^{i q \pi} \right) \right| \geq \sum_{n=b+2}^\infty r^{n!}-M $$ which tends to $\infty$ as $r \to 1^-$. Since $\left\{ e^{i q \pi} : q \in \mathbb Q \right\}$ is a dense subset of the unit circle the above prevents the existence of direct analytic continuation by function elements $(g,\Omega')$, unless $\Omega' \subseteq \Omega$. This is true since if $\Omega'$ leaves $\Omega$ it must contain a boundary point whose corresponding radius has an argument which is a rational multiple of $\pi$. Since $f=g$ on $\Omega \cap \Omega'$ it follows that $g$ has infinity as the radial limit towards that boundary point - which contradicts the analyticity of $g$ there. Is the above correct? If not please help me fix it. Thanks!","['analyticity', 'complex-analysis']"

611055,"Calculate the following integral $\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\sin^m x\,\mathrm{d}x}{\sin x + \cos x}$, $m=2k-1$","At the moment I am studing the following integral $$K(m,n)= \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\sin^m x\,\mathrm{d}x}{\sin^nx + \cos^nx}.$$ For integers $m$,$n$. The question regarding both $K(1,1)$ and
$K(n,n)$ has been asked countless of times before on the site. With the usual solution of
$x \mapsto \pi/2 - x$. I have tried to study the case $K(2k-1,1)$ for integers $k$.
It seems this integral does not take any elementary form, but can it be expressed in a easier fashion? Beneath is my work that proved more or less useless.. Assume that $m$ can be written on the form $2k-1$ where $k$ is some positive integer. Then we have from the binomial expansion that 
$$
\frac{a^n + b^n}{a+b} = a^{n-1} - a^{n-2}b + a^{n-3}b^2 + \cdots - a b^{n-2} + b^{n-1}
$$
for odd $n$. By using the usual substitution one obtains that 
$$
    K(m,1) = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\sin^mx + \cos^mx}{\cos x + \sin x} \mathrm{d}x
           = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{\pi/2} \left( \sum_{k=1}^m \cos^{m-k}(x)\sin^{k-1}(x)\right)\mathrm{d}x
$$
Since the integral is convergent for any positive $k$, both $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ live in $L^2$ we can switch the limits. By using the standard definition of the beta integral, the integral turns into 
$$
    K(m,1) = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{k=1}^m \operatorname{B}(x,y)
$$
With $2x-1=m-k$ and $2y-1=k-1$. But this does not seem any easier.. 
By using the symmetri $\operatorname{B}(y,x)=\operatorname{B}(x,y)$, 
and inputing $m = 2p-1$, the integral can also be written as
$$
    K(2p-1,1) = \frac{1}{4}\operatorname{B}\left(p^*,p^*\right) 
              + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \operatorname{B}(p-k^*,k^*)

With $p^*=p/2$ and $k^*=k/2$ to make the notation slightly better. Are there any other perhaps more elementary way to find an expression for the integral? Is it possible to simplify this expression more?","['special-functions', 'integration']"

Since there are no solutions, I was hoping I could get the help needed to figure it out. A BS1300 big-screen TV may die due to screen failure or power supply failure. The time until power supply failure is exponential with parameter 0.00001. The time until screen failure is exponential with parameter 0.00002. The time is in hours. a) Which failure is more probable to occur first? For this problem, I simply got the expected values and whichever was lower, it should be more probable as the time expected for it to fail was lower.
$E(X) = 100000$ hours for power supply, $E(X) = 50000$ hours for screen failure. Therefore, screen is more likely to fail first. b) What is the probability that a BS1300 will die within 10000 hours? PS = power supply, SF = screen failure
$P(PS = 10000) = 0.000016374 P(SF = 10000) = 0.000025422$.

611135,Consecutive partitions of positive integers,"Background (feel free to skip this part) Suppose we want to $k$-partition all the positive integers up to (and including) some integer $N$.  This partition should divide the numbers into $k$ sets, such that each set has the same sum. For example, for $N=4$, there is one possible $2$-partition:  $\{1,4\},\{2,3\}$ (since the sum of the numbers in each is $5$).  For another example, with $N=7$ there are multiple possible 2-partitions, one of which is: $\{1,2,4,7\},\{3,5,6\}$ (since the sum of the numbers in each is $14$). We can see that in order for any $N$ to have a valid $2$-partition, we need $\sum_{i=1}^N i = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ to be divisible by $2$, meaning
$$N(N+1) \text{ divisible by 4} \Rightarrow N \text{ or } N+1 \text{ divisible by 4}$$ It isn’t too difficult to determine similar requirements on $N$ for the existence of other $k$-partitions:
$$k=3: \quad N(N+1) \text{ divisible by 6} \Rightarrow N \text{ or } N+1 \text{ divisible by 3}$$
$$k=4: \quad N(N+1) \text{ divisible by 8} \Rightarrow N \text{ or } N+1 \text{ divisible by 8}$$
$$\vdots$$ It might be interesting to investigate how many $k$-partitions there are for any given $N$, but I’m more interested in the problem of imposing restrictions on the partitions (which makes it more difficult to find the $N$ for which they exist). The problem Let’s say we want (what I have dubbed) a consecutive $k$-partition.  That is, divide the positive integers up to (and including) $N$ into $k$ sets, such that each set has the same sum and the sets are ordered, with the largest number in each set being 1 less than the smallest number in the next set.  (Clearly, if there exists a consecutive $k$-partition for $N$, there is only one such partition.) In the case $k=2$, a consecutive $2$-partition exists for $N$ if we can find an $a$ such that:
$$1+2+\ldots+a = (a+1)+(a+2)+\ldots+N$$ For example, for $N=3$ there is one possible consecutive $2$-partition: $\{1,2\},\{3\}$.  The next $N$ for which there exists a consecutive $2$-partition is $N=20$, where $a=14$ and we have:
$$1+2+\ldots+14=105=15+16+\ldots+20$$ In general, a consecutive $2$-partition exists for $N$ if we can find an $a$ such that
$$\frac{a(a+1)}{2} = \frac{N(N+1)}{2} - \frac{a(a+1)}{2},$$
which by the quadratic formula means we need
$$a = \frac{\sqrt{2N^2 + 2N + 1}-1}{2}$$
to be a positive integer.  Since the root term will always be odd, the top will always be divisible by $2$, so we just need
$$a = 2N^2 + 2N + 1$$
to be a square number. Interesting note: We want $a = Z^2$ for some positive integer $Z$, and we can write $a = 2N^2 + 2N + 1 = N^2 + (N+1)^2 = Z^2$, and the rightmost equation is precisely the set of Pythagorean triples $(X, X+1, Z)$. Using this formula, the next $N$ after $3$ then $20$ seems to be $119$, then $696$, then $4059$, then $23660$.  Clearly these grow farther apart, and a brute-force iteration over all the positive integers will be very slow in finding these.  Is there a formula to find $N$s for which this $a$ exists?  Or, as a more theoretical question: What can we know about the set of these $N$s (how are they distributed among the positive integers)? This gets more tricky with consecutive $3$-partitions.  For any $N$, we need to find a $b$ and $c$ such that
$$\frac{b(b+1)}{2} = \frac{c(c+1)}{2} - \frac{b(b+1)}{2} = \frac{N(N+1)}{2} - \frac{c(c+1)}{2},$$
which means we need both of the following to be positive integers:
$$b = \frac{\sqrt{12b^2 + 12b + 9} – 3}{6}$$
$$c = \frac{\sqrt{24b^2 + 24b + 9} - 3}{6}$$
Multiplying the top and bottom by $\frac{1}{3}$ and noting that the top will then always be divisible by $2$, we just need
$$b = \frac{4}{3}N^2 + \frac{4}{3}N + 1$$
$$c = \frac{8}{3}N^2 + \frac{8}{3}N + 1$$
to be square numbers. I tested the above formulas on the first $25000$ positive integers, and haven’t found any $N$s with a consecutive $3$-partition.  Are there any? Summary of the questions Is there a formula to find $N$s for which a consecutive $2$-partition exists (without needing to iterate and see if there exists an integer $a$)? Are there any $N$s for which a consecutive $3$-partition exists?  What about for consecutive $4$-partitions, or $5$, etc.? For any $k$, what do we know (about the distribution among the positive integers) of the set of $N$s for which a consecutive $k$-partition exists? I’m fascinated by this topic, and any insights you can provide (perhaps using knowledge gleaned from more advanced number theory) would be helpful! UPDATE on question 2 For consecutive $3$-partitions, it seems like $N$s that satisfy the conditions on $b$ and $c$ can be expressed by recursive formulas:
$$\text{condition on } b \Rightarrow N_{i+2} = 4N_{i+1} - N_i + 1 \text{, with } N_0=0 \text{ and } N_1 = 2$$
$$\text{condition on } c \Rightarrow N'_{i+2} = 10N'_{i+1} - N'_i + 4 \text{, with } N'_0=0 \text{ and } N'_1 = 5$$ Side question: Is there a way to prove this? By iterating $i$, we can generate $N$s which satisfy the first condition, and $N'$s which satisfy the second condition.  I have done this to generate $N$ and $N'$ all the way up to $10^{300}$, and there are none which satisfy both conditions! Does this make it very likely that no consecutive $3$-partitions exist? These recursive formulas can also be expressed in closed form:
$$N_i = \frac{1}{4} \left((1+\sqrt{3})(2+\sqrt{3})^i + (1-\sqrt{3})(2-\sqrt{3})^i - 2 \right)$$
$$N'_i = \frac{1}{4} \left((1+\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2})(5+2\sqrt{6})^i + (1-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2})(5-2\sqrt{6})^i - 2 \right)$$
So the question becomes:

The problem is, that for every hour of leave paid to an employee, they are entitled to accrue an additional 0.038462 hours of leave, so as they take leave, they also accrue leave, which in turn they are entitled to take. The problem is, this makes it very hard to work out how much leave to give them so that their leave balance comes to 0 To give an example, I have an employee that currently has 10 hours leave but wants to take 20 hours all up. Since he takes 10 hours leave, he will accrue 10 x 0.038462 in leave for that pay run. So he's actually is entitled to take 10.38462 hours leave. So I change his leave taken to be 10.38462, but that means he accrues an additinal 0.0147932 hours of leave which you add on to the 10.38462 which then accrues another amount of leave and so on. So what I'm wondering is, if there's a formula that I could use to work out how much leave an employee could be paid given that every time they take leave, an additional amount of leave is accrued?","['sequences-and-series', 'algebra-precalculus']"

Me being a layman, I am having some problems figuring out one of the aspects for myself. The basic mechanic works like this: you roll a number of 6 sided dice. Any die that rolls a 5 or a 6 nets you a success. You count your total number of successes, and the more of them there are the better. Now, I know how to calculate the chance that I will succeed when I am trying to roll a fixed number of successes. But, sometimes the game has you roll against someone else's roll. For example: Player A rolls X number of dice with 6 sides. Player B rolls Y number of dice with 6 sides. The person who rolls more results of 5 or 6 succeeds. How do I calculate the probability that player A will succeed? Thank you very much in advance!","['dice', 'probability']"

But in case 1) should I try to somehow show that $f^{(n)}(a)$ vanishes for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and for all integers $k > n$ ? Cauchy's estimate seems not to be helpful . On the other hand, we can say that the behavior of $g(z)=f(\frac{1}{z})$ around zero is the same as the behavior of $f(z)$ at $\infty$ and Because $\infty$ is a pole of finite order,  Can I say that $g(z)=\frac{h(z)}{z^k}$, where $\lim_{z \rightarrow 0} h(z) \neq 0 \ \ \ $ AND ? $ \ \ \  \lim_{z \rightarrow 0} h(z) \neq \infty $ Hence $f(z)=g(\frac{1}{z})=z^kh(\frac{1}{z})$ According to above , Can we conclude that $f(z)$ is a polynomial ?

611293,Image of the set of natural numbers under any function is denumerable.,"Hi everyone I'd like to know if the following reasoning is correct, any suggestion would be great. Thanks. Proposition : Let $Y$ be a set and let $f: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow Y$ be a function. Then $f[\mathbb{N}]$ is at most countable. Proof: If $Y$ is finite the result follows, this is because$f[\mathbb{N}]\subset Y$ and any subset of a finite set  is finite and has at most the size of the set in which is contained. We may assume  that the set $Y$ is infinite. We set $A:= \{\,n\in\mathbb{N}:f(i)\not=f(n) \,\,\text{ for  any }i< n\, \}$. And we define the function $g:A \rightarrow f[\mathbb{N}]$ as the restriction of $f$ in $A$. We claim that the function $g$ is a bijective map. From the definition of $A$ we already know that the map is $1:1$. We will show that also is onto. Let $y\in f[\mathbb{N}]$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is no $n\in A$ such that $g(n)=y$. Since $y$ lies in the image of $f$, then there is some $j\in \mathbb{N}$ for which $y=f(j)$. Then either $f(j)\not= f(i)$ for any $i<j$ or there exists some $i<j$ such that $f(j)= f(i)$. For the former, $j$ lies in $A$ (by its definition). For the latter, the set $\{\, n\in \mathbb{N}: f(j)=f(n)\, \text{and }\,n\not=j \}$ is non empty, and hence has a minimum element. Let $m$ be its minimum element. Then $f(m)\not=f(n)$ for any $n<m$ and thus $\,m\in A$ but $g(m)=f(m)= f(j)=y$. Thus any case leads to a contradiction. The result follows by reductio ad absurdum. Hence $f$ is surjective and injective, i.e., a bijective map. Since there is a bijection between $A$ and the images of the natural numbers under $f$, both have the same cardinality. Also we already know that $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ and any set of the natural numbers is denumerable, thus $f[\mathbb{N}]$ is countable. $\Box$","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

    P_2(2) = \frac{2 \int_{-a}^{a} \sqrt{2r(r+x)\,}\,}{2 \pi r^2} = \frac{16}{3\pi}
$$
I also tested the results through matlab, generating $10^9$ points, and measuring the avreage distance. My results for a unit circle was
$$
   D \approx 1.1864
$$
Which unfortunately did not yield any result wheter in Wolfram, OEIS, or a inverse symbolic generator. This contradicts my arithmetic, meaning I should be wrong. The code snippet can be found below, nothing terribly exciting. a = 1;
N = 10^8;

x1= a.*(2*rand(N,1)-1);
y1 = a.*(2*rand(N,1)-1);

x2= -a;
y2 = 0;

P = mean(sqrt((y2-y1).^2 + (x2-x1).^2)); What is the correct answer to $P_2(2)$ (average distance of two points on a circle)? Can one make any generalizations to $P_n(2)$ (average distance of two points on the the $n$-dimensional sphere? What about $P_n(m)$ or $P_2(m)$ ? Where $n$ is the dimension of the sphere, and $m$ is the number of points.","['geometry', 'calculus', 'probability', 'geometric-probability']"
611774,Equators in the $4$-dimensional sphere.,"Are there infinitely many disjoint equators (centrally symmetric circles) on the surface of the $4$-dimensional sphere? There are at least two of them, namely $[0,0,x,\sqrt{1-x^2}]$ and $[x,\sqrt{1-x^2},0,0] $ , $ x\in [-1,1]$. (Note that we may have to adjust the sign of the squareroot, but that just confuses the reader.)

611788,Limit of some sum of powers,"I'm here to ask you guys if my logic is correct. 
I have to calculate limit of this: 
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{\sum_{k=1}^n (k^{999} + \frac{1}{\sqrt k})}$$ 
At first point. I see it's some limit of $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{1^{999} + \frac{1}{\sqrt 1} + 2^{999} + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \dots + n^{999} + \frac {1}{\sqrt n} }$$ 
And now is generally my doubt. Can i assume that if this limit goes to one then if limit of larger sequence goes to one too, then my original sequence goes to one too? I came up with something like this. if $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sqrt[n]{\sum_{k=1}^n k^{1000}}$$ this limit goes to one ( cause obviously, expression under original sum is much lower than second sum ) then original limit goes to one too. But i made it even simplier. 
$$\sum_{k=1}^n k^{1000} < n^{1001}$$, so... 
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sqrt[n]{n^{1001}}$$ this limit obviously goes to 1. Ans my final answer is that original limit goes to one too.
I did some kind of bounding. But i'm not sure if i can do it. Any answers and tips are going to be greatly appreciated :-) Thanks.",['limits']

611816,Uniformly distributed points over the surface of the standard simplex,"I would like to generate points that are uniformly distributed over the SURFACE of a standard $k$-simplex ($k$ dimensions, $k+1$ vertices). One way to efficiently generate points that are uniformly distributed over the ENTIRETY of the $k$-simplex is to generate samples of $k$ iid exponential random variables, $E_i$, $i\in \left[1,k\right]$, then normalize, and $\vec{X}=\frac{\left\langle E_1,E_2,\dots,E_k\right\rangle}{\sum_{i=1}^k E_i}$, will be uniformly distributed over the entire $k$-simplex. My problem is that the probability that one of these points lands on the surface (i.e. at a vertex, or along a hyper-edge, or on hyper-face, etc.) is nearly $0$, so that in practice all of the points end up being in the INTERIOR of the $k$-simplex. In an attempt to sample the SURFACE of the $k$-simplex I have considered each hyper-edge, hyper-face, etc. separately and generated uniformly distributed samples on each (since they are themselves lower dimensional simplices). However, the problem becomes computationally unfeasible as $k$ increases because the number of hyper-edges, hyper-faces, etc. blows up. Does anyone know of a method to explicitly generate samples that are uniformly distributed over the SURFACE (or BOUNDARY) of a standard $k$-simplex?","['statistics', 'simplex', 'sampling', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

611860,"Compute Cov(X,Y) while X is the number of 1's and Y is the number of 2's in n dice rolls","Let $X$ be the number of 1's and $Y$ be the number of 2's that occur in
$n$ rolls of a fair die. Compute $Cov(X,Y)$. What's wrong with my solution? Here it is: $Cov(X,Y)=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]$ Compute $E[X]$ as follows: $E[X]=1*{n\choose 1}*\frac{1}{6}*(\frac{5}{6})^{n-1}+2*{n\choose 2}*\frac{1}{6^{2}}*(\frac{5}{6})^{n-2}+...+n*{n\choose n}*\frac{1}{6^{n}}$ This is binomial distribution so
$$E[X]=np=\frac{n}{6}$$
There's no difference between $E[X]$ and $E[Y]$ so $$E[X]=E[Y]$$ I believe all's correct so far. My problem is in computing $E[XY]$. This is what i've done: $E[XY]$ is the number of times we got 1 and 2 at the same time. Which is impossible. Hence $$E[XY]=0$$
Finally we can say $$Cov(X,Y)=0-\frac{n^2}{36}=-\frac{n^2}{36}$$ I found in some website that they got a final answer of $\frac{n}{36}$ because they divided the problem into 2 parts: (1) $X$ and $Y$ are dependent , (2) $X$ and $Y$ are independent. When they're independent $Cov(X,Y)=0$ , and when they're dependent $E[XY]=0$ and thus for roll $i$:
$$Cov(X,Y)=E[X_i Y_i]-E[X_i]E[Y_i]=0-\frac{1}{36}=-\frac{1}{36}$$
And consequently:
$$Cov(X,Y)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}{Cov(X_i Y_j)}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}{Cov(X_i Y_i)}=-\frac{n}{36}$$
I mainly don't understand why the 2 sums turned into 1 sum. I think it should be $n$ times the answer. edit(after considering @blf's answer): So i guess:
$$E[XY]=2\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=i}^{n-i}i*j*{n\choose i}{n-i\choose j}*\frac{1}{6^{i}}*\frac{1}{6^j}*(\frac{4}{6})^{n-i-j}$$ $$-\sum_{i=1}^{n}i*i*{n\choose i}{n-i\choose i}*\frac{1}{6^{i}}*\frac{1}{6^i}*(\frac{4}{6})^{n-2i}$$ (I substract that last value because i counted the cases $i=j$ twice.)
