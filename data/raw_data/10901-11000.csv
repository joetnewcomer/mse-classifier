83690,Group actions in towers of Galois extensions,"Assume we are given an extension of number fields or $\mathfrak{p}$-adic number fields $L/E/K$ where each extension is abelian and $L/K$ is only assumed Galois. Now take any element $\sigma\in \textrm{Gal}(E/K)$. We can extend $\sigma$ to an element of $\tilde{\sigma}\in \textrm{Gal}(L/K)$. If $\tilde{\eta}$ is another such extension, then $\tilde{\sigma}$ and $\tilde{\eta}$ are conjugate by an element of $\textrm{Gal}(L/E)$. It follows that $\textrm{Gal}(E/K)$ defines a well-defined action on $\textrm{Gal}(L/E)$ by conjugating with a lifting, since the result of the conjugation is independent of the particular lift. My question is essentially the following: Will this action give us any useful information about the extension $L/K$? Does it fit into the functoriality of class field theory in some way? For example, taking $E/K$ to be quadratic and $L/E$ to be an abelian extension of degree $4$, then we have that the action is trivial if only if $L/K$ is also abelian, so it should let us distinguish between abelian extensions and non-abelian extensions. How far can this be pushed in general and how much information can we generally get out of it? Are there any other interesting actions induced by different groups appearing in class field theory?","['soft-question', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

83756,"More examples of Simpson's Paradox, barring the ones on Wikipedia, Titanic, and delayed flights.","I hope someone may know fresh examples of Simpson's paradox for use in my statistics courses.

These are all good ones, but, like I said, I'm looking for more. Does anybody know any others?

83781,"Is a countable, totally disconnected Hausdorff space necessarily totally separated? How about zero-dimensional?","I'm starting to feel a little bad about using this website as my own personal counterexample generator, but here I go again... Terminology: Let's call a space zero-dimensional if it is $T_0$ and admits a basis of clopen sets. By a standard embedding argument, a space is zero-dimensional if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of some (possibly uncountable) power of the two-point discrete space $\{0,1\}$. In particular, zero-dimensional implies Hausdorff, or even completely regular. Let's call a space $X$ totally separated if, given distinct points $x,y \in X$, there exists a separation $U,V$ of $X$ (ie. $U,V$ partition $X$ and are open) such that $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. In particular, a totally separated space is Hausdorff. Clearly zero-dimensional implies totally separated. Finally, let's call a space totally disconnected if all its connected components are singletons. Clearly totally separated implies totally disconnected (conversely, totally disconnected need not even imply Hausdorff). My question: Let $X$ be a countable, totally disconnected Hausdorff space. Can $X$ fail to be totally separated? If yes, can $X$ fail to be zero-dimensional? Some discussion: If we replace ""countable"" with ""compact, the answer to both questions is ""no"". For a compact Hausdorff space, the components and quasicomponents coincide, so $X$ is totally separated. Then, by applying basic compactness arguments, we can prove even that for all $A,B \subset X$, disjoint closed sets, there is a separation $U,V$ of $X$ with $A \subset U, B \subset V$. In particular, $X$ is zero-dimensional. The hypothesis of compactness cannot be dropped though. For example Cantor's leaky tent is a (noncompact, noncountable) subspace of the Euclidean plane which can be shown, with some effort, to be totally disconnected - but not totally separated. Since the hypothesis of compactness cannot be dropped, I wondered whether it could be replaced with something else. In particular, I wondered whether countable would do. Added: Here's another counterexample. The main idea is the same as in Brian's example, but I thought this space seemed somehow more concrete. As a set, let $X := \mathbb{Q} \cup \{p_0,p_1\}$ where $p_0,p_1$ are two distinct points not in $\mathbb{Q}$. For $n=0,1,2,\ldots$, let $I_n := (n,n+1) \cap \mathbb{Q}$. We put $U \subset X$ open if and only if the following are satisfied: $U \cap \mathbb{Q}$ is open in the standard topology on $\mathbb{Q}$. If $p_0 \in U$, then $U$ contains all but finitely many of $I_0,I_2,I_4,\ldots$ If $p_1 \in U$, then $U$ contains all but finitely many of $I_1,I_3,I_5,\ldots$ It is easy to see this topology is Hausdorff. To see it is totally disconnected, suppose that $C \subset X$ is connected with more than one point. Intervals with irrational endpoints are still clopen, and these can be used to separate a fixed rational number from any other point in $X$. It follows that $C$ contains no rationals. Thus $C = \{p_0,q_0\}$, but this space is discrete ($X$ is Hausdorff), so no such $C$ exists. However, $X$ is not totally separated. Neighbourhoods of $p_0$ and $q_0$ cannot have disjoint closures.",['general-topology']

83813,Slight generalization of an exercise in (blue) Rudin,"Exercise 7.20 of blue Rudin ( Principles of Mathematical Analysis ), 3rd edition, says: If $f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ and if 
$$\int_0^1f(x)x^n\,dx = 0, (n=0,1,2,\ldots),$$
prove that $f(x)=0$ on $[0,1].$ One proof: Let $\{p_n\}$ be a sequence of polynomials uniformly approximating $f.$ Then $p_nf\rightarrow f^2$ uniformly too. Then
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_0^1p_n(x)f(x)\,dx = 0 = \int_0^1f^2(x)\,dx,$$
since we can interchange the integral and the limit. Since $f^2$ is continuous, we have $f^2=0$ and thus $f=0$ too. Now, my question is if we drop the assumption that $\int_0^1f(x)\,dx = 0,$ does the result still hold? Slightly rephrased, If $f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ and satisfies 
$$\int_0^1f(x)x^n\,dx = 0, (n=1,2,3,\ldots),$$
is $f=0$ on $[0,1]?$ If $f(0) = 0$ then this is true. In this case, extend $f$ to an odd function on $[-1,1].$ Take a sequence of polynomials $\{q_n\}$ uniformly approximating $f.$ Then the sequence 
$${\frac{q_n(x)-q_n(-x)}{2}}$$
is an approximation of $f$ without a constant term, and we can apply the same trick as above. So,we only need to look at the case when $f(0)\neq 0.$ Does anyone know a proof, or have a counterexample to this generalized statement?",['real-analysis']

83830,"How to show that $C=C[0,1]$ is a Banach space","Let $C=C[0,1]$ be the space of all continuous functions on $[0,1]$. Define $\|f \|=\max \ |f(x)|$. I want to show that $C$ is a Banach space. Below is my attempt and I was wondering if it's ok. I know I have to show that $C$ is a complete normed space. Clearly, $\|f\| \geqslant 0$ and $\|f\|=0 \Leftrightarrow f=0$. $\|cf \|=\max~|cf(x)|=|c|\max |f(x)|=|c| \cdot \|f\|$. $\|f+g\|=\max~|f(x)+g(x)|\leq \max~|f(x)|+\max~|g(x)|=\|f\|+ \|g\|$. So $C$ is a normed space. Next, I show that every Cauchy sequence in $C$ is convergent. Let $\{f_n\}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $C$. Let $\varepsilon \gt 0.$ Then $\exists$ an $N_1$ such that $$ \max~|f_n(x)-f_m(x)| \lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$$
for $n, m \gt N_1$ and $x\in[0,1]$. But there is a subsequence $f_{k_n} $, which converges to $f$. So $\exists$ an $N_2$ such that
$$ \max~\left|f_{k_n} - f\right|\lt \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$$
for each $n\gt N_2$. Now Let $N = \max\{N_1, N_2\}$, if $n \gt N$ then $k_n \geqslant n\gt N$. So we have
$$ \max~\left|f_n(x) - f(x)\right| \leqslant \max~\left|f_n - f_{k_n}\right| + \max~\left| f_{k_n} - f\right| \lt\frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} = \varepsilon.$$

But, in this proof he relies on the following nice fact: $\eta$ is an isomorphism if and only if for all open $U \subset X$, the component maps $\eta(U) : F(U) \rightarrow G(U)$ are bijective.

((I think (2) is true, but hopefully there is a solution to my problem without using this fact.)) Even if we assume (2) to be a true statement, then to prove the backward implication of (1) we still cannot extend Hartshorne's method, for when he shows that for all open $U \subset X$, $\eta(U): F(U) \rightarrow G(U)$ is surjective, he needs the assumption that $\eta(U)$ are injective, which he proves beforehand.

83882,"Given integers $(a_i)$, what's the smallest $k$ for which the $a_i$ are distinct mod $k$?","We are given positive integers $n$ and $M$, with $n \ll M$, and a sequence $(a_i)_{i=1}^n$ of distinct integers satisfying $0 \le a_i < M$. Let $k$ be the smallest positive integer such that all the $a_i$ are distinct $\mod k$. Questions: With $n$ and $M$ fixed, what is the expected value of $k$? And what is its maximum possible value? Motivation: The $a_i$ are breakpoint addresses in a computer program. The number of breakpoints $n$ will typically be less than 50, and the maximum address $M$ will typically be less than half a million. Given an address, I need to be able to find the breakpoint at that address very quickly. One solution is simply a table of pointers, with $M$ entries, but that is very wasteful of space $-$ most of the entries would be zero. So I would like to use a table of size $k$, if I can be sure of finding a suitable $k$ reasonably quickly. Once $M$ is large enough, its actual order of magnitude won't affect the expected value very much. In other words, as $M \rightarrow \infty$ with $n$ fixed, the expected value of $k$ tends to a limit. But it will certainly affect the worst case. For instance, given any $m$, we can set $a_i = i \times m!$ to ensure that $k$ is greater than $m$. I have run some simulations. With $n=50$, and $M=2^{30}$, a run of $100000$ trials gives a mean of about $307$, with a worst case of $k=557$. With $n=100$, the mean is about $972$ and the worst case is $1570$.",['number-theory']
83885,Polynomial $p(x)$ is a unit (invertible) $\iff p_0 = p(0)$ is a unit & all other coef's are nilpotent,"I am learning ring theory in the Dummit & Foote's Abstract Algebra, and I am doing all the exercises to get as much experience as possible... but some of them just get me stuck for hours! Like this one : Assume $R$ is a commutative ring with identity. Prove that $p(x)=a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \in R[x]$ is a unit if and only if $a_0$ is a unit and $a_1, \dots, a_n$ are nilpotent in $R$. Now I already have the $\Longleftarrow$ part, since I've proven in a previous exercise that the sum of nilpotent elements is nilpotent and the sum of a unit with a nilpotent element is a unit, hence $a_0 + (a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^n)$ has a sum of nilpotents between the parenthesis, and thus is written as the sum of a unit and a nilpotent element, thus is a unit. I can't deal with the converse though. I've tried noticing that if $p(x)$ is a unit and $q(x)$ is its inverse then $p(x) q(x) = 1$ implies that $p(x)^m q(x)^m = 1$ (because $R$ is commutative), but that only gave me that if $p$ has degree $n$ and $q$ has degree $r$ with last coefficient $b_r$ then $a_n b_r$ is $0$, and got stuck there. I also tried to take a look at what $p(x) q(x)$ looks like : If $p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k$ and $q(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n b_k x^k$ (just add zeros to get those two sums of same size), then

a_0 b_0 =1 ,\quad a_1 b_0 + a_0 b_1 = 0, \quad a_2 b_0 + a_1 b_1 + a_0 b_2 = 0, \quad \cdots

and I thought I could get something out of those equations but all I have now is that $a_1$ is nilpotent if and only if $b_1$ is, which doesn't help me much. Any hints? I don't need a full solution if there's a way to just point out a nice trick.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

  instituted betting limits specifically to stop Martingale players, but

  advantage over any other betting system or even randomly placed bets. I don't quite understand this.

83922,Properties of dual spaces of sequence spaces,"Can you tell me if I got the following homework right? Nitpicking is welcome. a) Recall that $$ c_0 (\mathbb{N}) = \{ f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \mid \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } f(n) = 0\} \subset l^\infty ( \mathbb{N}) $$
is a Banach space with respect to the supremum norm $\| . \|_\infty $. Show that 
$(c_0(\mathbb{N}))^\ast \cong l^1(\mathbb{N})$ where the dual pairing is given by
$$ \langle f, g \rangle = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty f(n) g(n)$$
for $f \in c_0(\mathbb{N})$ and $g \in l^1(\mathbb{N})$. b) Show that $(l^1(\mathbb{N}))^\ast \cong l^\infty(\mathbb{N})$ c) Compute the dual of $c(\mathbb{N}) = \{ f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} | \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f(n) $ exists $\}$ d) Show that $l^1$ is not reflexive by showing that a Banach limit does not come from a pairing as above with an element of $l^1$ My answers: a) We want to show that $\varphi : l^1(\mathbb{N}) \rightarrow (c_0 (\mathbb{N}))^\ast$ defined by $g \mapsto \langle ., g\rangle$ is an isomorphism. First, I think, we need to verify that it maps into $(c_0 (\mathbb{N}))^\ast$. So let $f \in c_0(\mathbb{N})$. Then
$$ | \langle f,g \rangle | = \Big | \sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n) g(n) \Big | \leq \sum_{n=0}^\infty |f(n)| |g(n)| \leq \| f \|_\infty \sum_{n=0}^\infty | g(n)| < \infty$$ Next we need to verify that it's a vector space homomorphism, that is, it's linear. For this, let $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}, g \in l^1(\mathbb{N})$ and $f_1 , f_2 \in c_0(\mathbb{N})$. Then
$$ \langle \alpha (f_1 + f_2), g \rangle = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \alpha (f_1 + f_2)(n) g(n) = \alpha \sum_{n=0}^\infty f_1(n)g(n) + \alpha \sum_{n=0}^\infty f_2(n)g(n) = \alpha \langle f_1 , g \rangle + \alpha \langle f_2 , g \rangle$$ Next we need to show that $\varphi$ is injective. For this let $g \in l^1(\mathbb{N})$ such that $\langle f,g \rangle = 0$ for all $f$ in $c_0(\mathbb{N})$. Then in particular, $\langle f_N,g \rangle = 0$ for 
$$ f_N (n) := \begin{cases} 1 & n = N \\ 0 & otherwise \end{cases}$$ So $g(n) = 0$ for all $n$ and so $\ker \varphi = \{ 0 \}$. The last thing to verify is that $\varphi$ is surjective. Consider any $\lambda \in c_0(\mathbb{N})^\ast$. For the next step $\mathbb{N}$ should be locally compact and Hausdorff. This would be the case if $\mathbb{N}$ had the discrete topology but the topology is not specified in the homework so I'm not so sure about the following: By Riesz-Markov there exists a unique regular countably additive complex Borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{N}$ such that $\varphi(f) = \int_X f(x) d \mu$. Set $g(n) := \mu(n)$ then $\varphi(f) = \int_X f(x) d \mu = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n) g(n)$. $g(n) \in l^1$ because $\mu$ is regular and therefore has finite measure on each compact set, in particular $\{ n \}$. b) Here we need to verify that $\varphi^\prime: g \mapsto \langle ., g \rangle$ is an isomorphism where $g \in l^\infty(\mathbb{N})$. By the same arguments as in a) I showed that it maps into $(l^1 (\mathbb{N}))^\ast$, that it's a homomorphism and that it's injective. To verify that it's surjective, consider any $\lambda : l^1(\mathbb{N}) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. Then $\lambda$ can be split into positive real functions as follows: $\lambda = \Re (\lambda) + i \Im(\lambda) = \Re (\lambda)^+ - \Re (\lambda)^- + i \Im(\lambda)^+ - i \Im(\lambda)^-$. Then for each part separately, there exists a unique regular measure by the same argument as in a), so $\varphi^\prime$ is surjective. c) To compute $(c(\mathbb{N}))^\ast$ consider an $s \in c(\mathbb{N})$. Then $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_n = k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(s_n - k) = 0$ so $(s_n - k)$ is an element of $c_0(\mathbb{N})$. Now I'm not sure about my next step. I suspected that if $V, V^\prime$ are isomorphic vector spaces then their duals $V^\ast$ and $(V^\prime)^\ast$ are isomorphic. So I constructed a bijective linear function from $c(\mathbb{N})$ into $c_0(\mathbb{N}) \times \mathbb{C}$ as follows: $s_n \mapsto (s_n - k, k)$ and verified that it's bijective and linear. d) To show that $l^1$ is not reflexive I used Kakutani's theorem which says that $l^1$ is reflexive if and only if the closed unit ball is weakly compact. To find an open cover of the unit ball that doesn't contain a finite subcover pick $B_1 (f) $, the ball of radius $1$ around $f$ for all $f$ with $\| f \| = 1$. Then any two such $f$ have distance $2$ and therefore no $f$ is in any $B_1 (f^\prime) $ for any $f^\prime$ with $\| f^\prime \| = 1$. There is an infinite number of $f$'s with $\| f \| = 1$ so any finite collection of balls $B_1 (f) $ leave an infinite number of $f$'s uncovered. So $l^1$ is not reflexive.

So far, I understood how all the orbits can be obtained via the $j$-function, but I'm struggling to see some algebraic properties of the more obvious orbits. Specifically, define $C = \{ [v^4] | v \in V\}$ $\Sigma = \{ [v^3\cdot w] | v, w \operatorname{independent} \in V\}$ $\Phi = \{ [v^2\cdot w^2] | v, w \operatorname{independent} \in V\}$ $\Psi = \{ [v^2\cdot w \cdot u] | v, w,u \operatorname{pairwise independent} \in V\}$ Now these are orbits because three pairwise independent vectors are projectively equivalent in $\mathbb{P}^1$, and C is a closed orbit because it can be described as a rational normal curve of degree 4. Supposedly, this is the only closed orbit of all the above. How, for instance, can I see that $\Sigma$ is not closed in the Zariski topology?

Because one has to give additional information at which of the rays forming the angle to start measuring, if I'm not mistaken. And then there's also the problem of measuring an angle - Why does one use dimension-sounding phraseology, like ""degree"" or ""radian"", if at the core of the definition, the measure of an angle, is nothing more than a function, associating every pair of rays sharing a common endpoint a number, by a (strictly mathematically speaking) rather complicated process, of computing the length of a curve ? Do you know of other definitions of an angle ? It seems to me, like the mathematical object ""angle"" is getting too little attention - in almost no textbook during the first years of university does it come up (although one needs it for example in complex analysis, for the multiplication of complex numbers), and when it is used, just an intuitive definition of it is assumed.",['geometry']

I said let V be a inner product space with orthonormal basis $\{u_1, \dots ,u_{2n}\}$ and let, $u,v \in V$ and $u= \sum_{i=1}^{2n}a_iu_i$ and $v= \sum_{i=1}^{2n}a_iu_i$.

If $f = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n \in A[x]$ is a polynomial, define $c(f) = A a_0 + A a_1 + \cdots + A a_n$ the ideal of $A$ generated by the coefficients of $f$. Consider $S$ the subset of $A[x]$ made up of primitive polynomials, i.e. polynomials $f \in A[x]$ such that $c(f) = A$. It is not difficult to prove that $S$ is a multiplicative subset of $A[x]$. Consider the ring
$$
A(x) = S^{-1} (A[x]).
$$
It is easy to show that $S$ does not contain zero-divisors of $A[x]$, hence $A \subseteq A[x] \subseteq A(x)$. If $I$ is an ideal of $A$ then $(I \cdot A(x)) \cap A = I$. If $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal of $A$ then $\mathfrak{p} \cdot A(x)$ is a prime ideal of $A(x)$. The map $\phi \colon \mathrm{Spec} A(x) \to \mathrm{Spec} A$ defined by $\phi(P) = P \cap A$ is surjective, because a right-inverse is $\mathfrak{p} \mapsto \mathfrak{p} \cdot A(x)$. It is clear that $\dim A \leq \dim A(x) \leq \dim A[x]$. If $M$ is a maximal ideal of $A(x)$, then does there exist a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$ such that $M = \mathfrak{m} \cdot A(x)$?

84317,"""Semidirect product"" of graphs?","The first subquestion is ""has a standard notion of semidirect product been defined in graph theory""?
If yes, i'd like to know if the definition i'm gonna give is equivalent to the standard one. I'd also like to know if there's some litterature about it.
If the answer was ""no"", would you accept my definition as a reasonable ""semidirect product""? Consider two graphs $G$ and $H$ (finite, undirected, simple, loopless, and of order $n,m$ respectively), and let $Aut(H)$ denote the set of automorphisms of $H$. Pick $\phi_1, ..., \phi_n \in Aut(H)$, and construct a semidirect product as follows: Label the elements of $G$ as $1,2,...,n$.
Pick $n$ copies $H_1, ..., H_n$ of $H$. If $x_i \in H_i$ and $x_j \in H_j$, add an edge between them iff $(i,j) \in E_G$ and  $\phi_i(x_i)= \phi_j(x_j)$.
The result of this operation is the semidirect product $G \ltimes_{(\phi_1, ..., \phi_n)} H$ I hope this is clear... In other words, you perform a simple cartesian product, but you tilt each ""$H$"" component using an automorphism before connecting the respectives fibers.
As an exemple, consider the Petersen graph as a semidirect product of $K_2$ and $C_5$ (where we can choose the identity and a nontrivial automorphism): Let $G = K_2$ and let $H=H_1=H_2$ be the cycle $a - b - c - d - a$ (dashes mean adiacency. Also let $\phi_1, \phi_n$ be automorphisms in $Aut(H)$ defined as: $\phi_1 = Id$ $\phi_2(a)=a;  \phi_2(b)=c; \phi_2(c)=e; \phi_2(d)=b; \phi_2(e)=d;$ Following the definition we will add an edge between: $a \in H_1$ and $a \in H_2$ as $a = \phi_1(a) = \phi_2(a) = a$ $b \in H_1$ and $d \in H_2$ as $b = \phi_1(b) = \phi_2(d) = b$ $c \in H_1$ and $b \in H_2$ as $c = \phi_1(c) = \phi_2(b) = c$ $d \in H_1$ and $e \in H_2$ as $c = \phi_1(d) = \phi_2(e) = d$ $e \in H_1$ and $c \in H_2$ as $c = \phi_1(e) = \phi_2(c) = e$ Thanks for reading.

If it were empty, then $$2\lambda(E\cap J)=\lambda(((E\cap J)+x)\cup(E\cap J))\leq\lambda(J\cup(J+x))\leq 3\lambda(J)/2,$$ thus $\lambda(E\cap J)\leq 3\lambda(J)/4$, a contradiction. Then $((E\cap J)+x)\cap (E\cap J)\neq\emptyset$, and so $x\in (E\cap J)-(E\cap J)\subseteq E-E$. Thus $E-E$ contains the box of $x$ such that $|x|\leq \epsilon$. Is this valid? If not, can it be fixed? Many thanks.","['measure-theory', 'analysis']"

84504,Are the local rings at smooth points of an irreducible variety isomorphic?,"If it is wrong, then how about restrict the varieties to smooth ones? In order to investigate it I also asked whether Aut(X) always acts transitively over a projective variety X. But I don't know how to prove/disprove this either... This latter question is also one thing I want to ask in this post.",['algebraic-geometry']
84509,Binomial theorem application,"I have a question about the bonomial theorem, and in specifically, a question that I want help on. I have worked out the answer, but by manually expanding each and every alternative. However, I thought to myself that there must be a faster way of coming to the answer. I've spent an hour or so thinking about it, but haven't thought of anything. Is there any faster method of coming to the answer of the following question? If so, please explain to me how Thanks!","['algebra-precalculus', 'binomial-coefficients']"
84526,liminf in terms of the point-to-set distance,"Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a normed space and $C\subseteq \mathcal{X}$. We define the point-to-set distance for the set $C$ to be: $$
d_C:\mathcal{X}\ni x \mapsto d_c(x):= \inf_{y\in C}\|x-y\| \in [0,\infty]
$$ Additionally, we define the inner limit of a sequence of sets $C_n$ in $\mathcal{X}$ to be: $$
\liminf_n C_n = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \bigcap_{m=n}^\infty C_m
$$ This definition is equivalent to: $$
\liminf_n C_n = \left\{x \in \mathcal{X} | x\in C_k \text{ ultimately for all } k \right\}
$$ My initial question was: I need to prove that:
$$
\liminf_n C_n = \left\{ x \in \mathcal{X} | \liminf_{n\to\infty} \left(d_{C_n}(x)\right)=0\right\}
$$ But this is not true! The following facts hold true: $\liminf_n C_n \subseteq \left\{ x \in \mathcal{X} | \liminf_{n\to\infty} \left(d_{C_n}(x)\right)=0\right\} = \limsup_n C_n$ $\liminf_n C_n \subseteq \left\{ x \in \mathcal{X} | \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(d_{C_n}(x)\right)=0\right\}$ Edit 1. The meaning of ""ultimately for all $k$"" should be interpreted as follows: $$
\liminf_{n\to\infty} C_n = \{x | \forall k\in\mathbb{N} \exists x_k\in C_{n_k}:\ x_k\to x\}
$$
where $n_k\in\mathbb{N}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of indices (i.e. $\{C_{n_k}\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ is some subsequence of $\{C_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$). Edit 2. I changed the formula with the closure which was wrong according to Tim (thanks to the answer to Tim's question by Matthias Klupsch). I'll post a new question for what I read in Rockafellar's book and gave me the confusion.","['general-topology', 'limsup-and-liminf', 'real-analysis', 'analysis', 'limits']"
84530,Is every suborder of $\mathbb{R}$ homeomorphic to some subspace of $\mathbb{R}$?,"Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}$ and give $X$ its order topology. (When) is it true that $X$ is homeomorphic to some subspace of $Y \subset \mathbb{R}$? Example: Let $X = [0,1) \cup \{2\} \cup (3,4]$, then $X$ is order isomorphic to $Y=[0,2]$ in a fairly obvious way, hence the order topologies on $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic. But, the order topology on $Y$ agrees with the subspace topology on $Y$, so this particular $X$ is indeed homeomorphic to a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$. Example: Let $X$ equal the set of endpoints of the Cantor set. The order on $X$ is a bit strange (it's order isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q} \times \{0,1\}$ in the dictionary order with a largest and smallest element adjoined), so one might expect the order topology on $X$ to be strange, but... $X$ is clearly 2nd countable under the order topology (there are countably many points, hence countably many intervals) and any order topology is regular, so $X$ is metrizeable by Urysohn. It is also easy to see the order topology on $X$ has no isolated points so, by a theorem of Sierpinski (any countable metric space without isolated points is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}$), the order topology on $X$ is homeomorphic to the subspace $Y = \mathbb{Q}$ of $\mathbb{R}$. For any countable $X$, the argument above shows the order topology on $X$ is metrizeable. In fact, I think the order topology on any $X \subset \mathbb{R}$ is metrizeable by this theorem of Lusin (an order topology $X$ is metrizeable if and only if the diagonal in $X \times X$ is a $G_\delta$ set). But this doesn't preclude the possiblity of $X$ weird enough to not be homeomorphic to any subspace of $\mathbb{R}$. I'm not sure how one would arrange this though. If it can be arranged with $X$ countable there would need to be many isolated points to avoid Sierpinski's result for instance... Advertisement: Brian's positive answer below actually proves something even better. Namely: Theorem: Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}$. Then there is an order isomorphism (hence homeomorphism of order topologies) $\varphi$ from $X$ to a new set $Y \subset \mathbb{R}$ whose order topology and subspace topology coincide. Roughly, approach is to take countable set $D \subset X$ such that each point in $X \setminus D$ is a 2-sided limit (topologically) of points in $D$. Using countability of $D$, one can find an order embedding $\varphi$ of $D$ into $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\varphi(D)$ has no ""topological gaps"" that are not also ""order gaps"" (this is the property which makes the subspace and order topologies coincide). The final step is to extend $\varphi$ to the rest of $X$ and check nothing goes awry in doing so.","['general-topology', 'order-theory']"
