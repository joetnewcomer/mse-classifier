364828,Relation between noncommutative geometry and functional analysis,"Recently I came across the subject of noncommutative geometry via my interest in functional analysis. My very little exposure to this subject gives me a sense that part of it is built on the theory of operator algebras and that together with many other tools/techniques are used to study geometric or topological problems. I couldn't help but ask (perhaps naively) whether things can go the other way, i.e. using tools in noncommutative geometry to study operator algebras (or even other objects that one would associate to functional analysis, such as operator spaces etc.). If anyone knows of such an approach, I would appreciate some descriptions or references.","['operator-theory', 'operator-algebras', 'functional-analysis', 'noncommutative-geometry']"

Given that $\alpha >\frac{1}{2}$, I need to show that $$S_n=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{X_k}{k^\alpha}$$ Converges almost surely. Can I have a hint for how to do this? To show that $$S_n=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{X_k}{k^\alpha}$$ converges, we use Kolmogorov's Three Series Theorem, which implies that we have to show three conditions are satisfied: a.) For some $A>0$,  $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mathbb P\left(\left|\frac{X_k}{k^{\alpha}}\right|\geq A\right)$ converges b.) Let $\displaystyle Y_{k}:=\frac{X_k}{k^{\alpha}}1_{\{\left|\frac{X_{k}}{k^{\alpha}}\right|\leq A\}}$, Then $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mathbb E[Y_{k}]$ converges; c.) $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mathrm{Var}(Y_{k})$ converges.","['probability-theory', 'convergence-divergence', 'random-variables']"

365005,How do I sell out with abstract algebra?,"My plan as an undergraduate was unequivocally to be a pure mathematician, working as an algebraist as a bigshot professor at a bigshot university.  I'm graduating this month, and I didn't get into where I expected to get into.  My letters were great and I'm published, but my GRE was bad and my grades were good but not perfect.  My current plan, I guess, is to start a PhD program at my backup school, and then reapply to the better schools next year. Reality is starting to hit, though, and I'm starting to think about ""selling out.""   I would still love to work in algebra, but I'm not as in love with the Ivory Tower as I was a few years ago, and I don't want to give up my entire life for it.  If the institution isn't going to let me do what I wanted to do, or if I'll never be as talented as I wanted to be, it isn't worth the sacrifice.  In other words, I'd rather be a well-paid applied mathematician in industry than a poor, mediocre pure mathematician at a low-end university. The problem is it seems that most of the applied jobs out there are all about analysis / continuous mathematics, and I am firmly in the algebra / discrete camp. I really do not want to spend my life-solving fluid flow PDEs. I always hear about cryptography as an ""applied algebra"" job, but I'm not particularly crazy about working for the NSA or a telecom (plus crypto can't be the only option). I read some of the answers from Can I use my powers for good? but it's not clear to me which of these suggestions value algebraic thinking.  Many seem very quantitative , rather than structural - is it possible to avoid this in the industry?  Also, I have a lot of debt from a long undergraduate career across several majors, so ""how much"" is unfortunately also a concern.  I don't want to sell out cheap. Are there applied math jobs in industry which focus on structural mathematics reminiscent of abstract algebra, earn an appreciably high salary, and aren't cryptography?

365069,"An exercise on cyclic extensions of Hungerford's book, Algebra.","I'm trying to show the following exercise of the book, it is in the section of cyclic extensions and says the following: Let $\overline{\mathbb Q}$ be a fixed algebraic closure of $\mathbb Q$, let $v\in\overline{\mathbb Q}-\mathbb Q$ and let $E\subseteq\overline{\mathbb Q}$ be a subfield maximal with respect to the property $v\notin E$. Prove that every finite dimensional extension of $E$ is cyclic. Well, this is my attempt of proof: First I prove that one can restrict himself to a finite Galois extensions. Then I prove that $E(v)$ is a Galois extension of $E$, by noting that for every $\sigma\in Aut_E E(v)$, $\sigma(v)\notin E$; and that $E(v)$ is a cyclic extension of $E$, because the absence of intermediate fields and applying the fundamental theorem of Galois theory . Next, I intend to proceed inductively in $n=[F:E]$ with the case $n=1$ being trivial: suppose that the proposition is true for every $m\leq r$, and that $r+1=[F:E]$; consider the intermediate field $E\subseteq E(v)\subseteq F$, if $E(v)=F$ the proposition has already been proven. If not then $[F:E(v)]\leq r$, and we have that $F$ is Galois over $E(v)$ (fundamental theorem), therefore the induction hypothesis shows that $Aut_{E(v)}F$ is cyclic. The fact that $E(v)$ is Galois over $E$ implies that $Aut_{E(v)}F$ is normal in $Aut_E F$ and again by the fundamental theorem $Aut_E E(v)=Aut_E F/Aut_{E(v)}F$. At this point I had been thinking about a proposition of the form ""If a finite group G contains a normal cyclic subgroup such that the quotient $G/N$ is also cyclic then G is cyclic""; which is false, even if one replace normal cyclic, for maximal normal cyclic, and things like this. I don't know what to do at this stage, I would be very grateful for a solution that follows this path. Thanks in advance.","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

365155,Showing that no Hamilton Circuit exists,"I was confused about a certain concept and I was wondering if I could get some help. There were three points that were made in my textbook to show that a graph does not contain a Hamilton circuit: A graph with a vertex of degree one cannot have a Hamilton circuit. Moreover, if a vertex in the graph has degree two, then both edges that are incident with this vertex must be part of any Hamilton circuit. A Hamilton circuit cannot contain a smaller circuit within it. I understand 1 and 3, but I'm a bit confused about 2. I wasn't really sure how this helps. I realize that the definition of a Hamilton circuit is a simple circuit in a graph that traverses over all vertices in the graph. But this is exactly what we are trying to disprove, so how is it helpful to say that both edges must be part of a Hamilton circuit when we don't even know if the graph contains a Hamilton circuit?

Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post . Closed 2 years ago . Improve this question I just watched this youtube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4eAyn-oK4M He lays out his objections against the $Ïµ,Î´$ definition around 14 min. Here is the discription of the video: In this video we aim to give a precise and simpler definition for what
  it means to say that: a rational polynumber on-sequence p(n) has a
  limit A, for some rational number A. Our definition is both much
  simpler and more logical than the usual epsilon -delta definition
  found in calculus texts. What is required is that we need to find two
  natural numbers: k called the scale, and m called the start that allow
  us to bound in a pretty simple way the difference between p(n) and A. The epsilon-delta definition of a limit is usually considered a high
  point of logical rigour. Not so. It is also considered too logically
  involving to be taken seriously as a pedagogical pillar for most
  undergrads. Hence students may be told about the definition, but are
  not required to seriously understand it, or be able to use it--unless
  they are prospective maths majors. There is a subtle ambiguity in the definition: given an epsilon we are
  supposed to demonstrate there is a delta (with certain properties) but
  how are we to do this, since an potential infinity of epsilons are
  involved? In practice what is required is a correspondence
  (function/relation etc) between epsilon and delta but the nature of
  this required correspondence is not clear. We return to our familiar
  conundrum of using the work``function'' without a proper definition of
  it. The key point that makes our simpler more intuitive notion of limit of
  a sequence work is that we are dealing with very particular and
  clearly defined on-sequences: those generated by a rationl polynumber.
  A good example of the benefits of being careful rather than casual
  when dealing with the foundations of analysis! My question is: Is this an opinion shared by more mathematicians ?

365476,Writing a group element as $ghg^{-1} h^{-1}$ and as $g^2 h^2$,"I recently read the elegant paper Generalized Frobenius Schur Numbers , by Bump and Ginzburg, which I learned about here . The results in this paper imply the following: Let $G$ be a finite group where every element is conjugate to its inverse. Then, for any $x \in G$, the number of ways to write $x$ as $ghg^{-1} h^{-1}$ is equal to the number of ways to write $x$ as $g^2 h^2$. I'll give the proof below, using character theory. I tried to find an elementary proof and failed. Can you do it? $\def\CC{\mathbb{C}}$We need to prove the equality $\sum_{g, h \in G} g^2 h^2 = \sum_{g, h \in G} g h g^{-1} h^{-1}$ in $\CC[G]$. Since we have $\CC[G] \cong \bigoplus_V \mathrm{End}(V)$, where the sum is over irreps of $V$, it is enough to show that both group elements act the same way on each $V$. As I computed in this answer , $\sum_{g, h \in G} ghg^{-1} h^{-1}$ acts on an irrep $V$ by $\left( \frac{|G|}{\dim V} \right)^2$. Now consider $\sum_{g \in G} g^2$ acting on an irrep $V$. Since $\sum_{g \in G} g^2$ is central in $\CC[G]$, it must act by a scalar, and computing traces we find that this scalar is $\frac{1}{\dim V} \sum_{g \in G} \chi_V(g^2)$. The quantity $\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \chi_V(g)^2$ is known as the Frobenius-Schur indicator and is $\pm 1$ for a group where every element is conjugate to its inverse. So $\sum_{g \in G} g^2$ acts on $V$ by $\pm \frac{|G|}{dim V}$
and
$\left( \sum_{g \in G} g^2 \right)^2$ acts on $V$ by $\left( \frac{|G|}{\dim V} \right)^2$. We have shown that $\sum_{g, h \in G} ghg^{-1} h^{-1}$ and $\left( \sum_{g \in G} g^2 \right)^2 = \sum_{g,h \in G} g^2 h^2$ act on every irrep by the same scalar, so they are equal in the group algebra. QED. The same argument shows that, in any finite group, the number of ways to write $x$ as $f^2 g^2 h^2$ is the same as the number of ways to write $x$ as $f^2 g h g^{-1} h^{-1}$, using that the Frob. Schur indicator is always $-1$, $0$ or $1$ and thus obeys $\epsilon^3 = \epsilon$.

Then, the step of the evaluation, we are following:
We fix the network size, e.g., 100 nodes, and evaluate how the convergence time, i.e., the number of rounds needed to have the ""local averages"" equal to the known global average changes as we change the nodes transmission range. Thus we do as follows:
-We take a given value of the transmission range, and generate 10 different networks, each with a given number of nodes , e.g., 100 nodes but in different random positions. For each network, measure the convergence time, and then take the average. And then we had the two cases:

The proof can be summarized in the following steps: For every $ v \in R^n $, $ |v|=1 $, the directional derivative $ D_vf $ exists a.e. in $ R^n $. The directional derivative $ D_vf $ is a weak derivative and therefore it holds that: $$D_vf(x)= v\cdot \nabla f(x) \text{ a.e. in } R^n.$$ There exists $ A \subset R^n $ such that $L^n(R^n-A)=0 $ ($L^n $ is the Lebesgue measure) and such that for every $ x \in A $ and for every $ v $ the directional derivative $ D_vf(x) $ exists. Note the difference between this step and the first step. As I've read, these three steps should be conclude the proof. But my doubt is obviously the following one: Since a continuous function with all of its directional derivatives at a point $ x $ is not necessarily differentiable at $ x $, how can I conclude the proof using only these three steps?","['measure-theory', 'geometric-measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

365603,Series of iterates of a power series,"Let $f = \sum_{n \ge 2} a_{n} x^{n}$ be a formal power series of order higher/equal two. By $$ f^{\circ n} := \underbrace{f \circ \dots \circ f}_{\text{ n times}}$$ we denote the $n^{th}$ iterate of $f$ and set $$f^{0} = x. $$ It is easily seen that the order of $f^{\circ n}$ is higher/equal $2^{n}$, so we may define the formal series  $$S(z):= \sum_{n\ge 0} f^{\circ n}.$$
If we assume that $f$ is a convergent power series, it is also not hard to show that $\sum_{n = 0}^{N} f^{\circ n}$ converges locally uniformly to $S$, especially $S$ is again a convergent power series.
Note however that $S \neq (x + f)^{ \circ -1}$ - it is in general not the composite inverse of (x+f). I don't have a particular reason for studying this series, but it seems to be interesting to ask - what is $S$?. In the sense that whether $S$ relates to $f$ in any ""familiar"" way, i.e. is the value of some better known operator evaluated at $f$ or does it have any interesting properties?
Maye someone already had a thought on it,thanks for all answers. EDIT: Here is the proof the $S(z)$ is analytic if $f$ is of order $\ge 2$ and convergent:
Since $f(0)=0$ you can find a neighborhood in which the modulus of $f$ is strictly smaller then one, so there exist $R>0$ and $M \in (0,1)$ so that $$\vert a_{n} \vert \le \frac{M}{R^{n}}.$$ And you obtain $$\vert f(x) \vert \le \vert \frac{x}{R} \vert ^{2} \frac{ M}{1 - \vert \frac{x}{R}\vert }$$ Since $0<M<1$ there is an $s>0$ so that $\frac{ M}{1 - \vert \frac{x}{R}\vert } \le 2$ for all $x \in D_{s}:= \{ \vert x \vert \le s\}$ and we choose $s$ so small that $\vert \frac{s}{R} \vert \le \frac{1}{2}$. Now I claim that on $D_{s}$ we have $$\vert f^{\circ n }(x) \vert \le \left\vert\frac{x}{R}\right\vert^{n} 2^{n},$$ which is proven by induction: Let $n=1$. Then $\vert f(x) \vert \le \vert\frac{x}{R} \vert^{2} \frac{ M}{1 - \vert \frac{x}{R}\vert } \le \vert\frac{x}{R} \vert \vert\frac{x}{R} \vert 2 \le \vert\frac{x}{R} \vert$. Now the step $n\to n+1$: $$ \vert f(f^{\circ n}) \vert \le \vert \frac xR \vert^{2 n} 2^{2n -2}
\frac{ M}{1 - \underbrace{\vert (\frac xR^{n}) 2^n\vert}_{\le \vert \frac{x}{R}\vert }} \le \vert \frac{x}{R} \vert^{2 n} 2^{2n -2} \cdot 2 \le 2^{n} \vert \frac{x}{R} \vert^{n+1}$$","['complex-analysis', 'combinatorics']"

365721,Circumference of a superellipse?,"Could someone help me formulate the circumference of a superellipse? 
$$\frac{x^n}{a^n} + \frac{y^n}{b^n} = 1$$
If it makes things easier, I'm considering only the cases $n>2$, and $n\in\mathbb{Q}$. Since the formula for an ellipse ($n=2$) involves special functions, I assume the general case won't be any simpler, but I can't seem to find any sources on this. I've also seen the circumference for an ellipse approximated by:
$$C \sim \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{a^2 + B^2}$$
Can this approximation be extended to the case of a superellipse, i.e:
$$C \sim A\sqrt{a^n + B^n}$$
Any help greatly appreciated. Edit: Someone by the name of Maher Izzedin Aldaher posted some approximate numerical formulae online, one of them being: $$4 \left[a+b \frac{ b\left(\frac{2.5}{n+0.5} \right)^{1/n} + \frac{0.566 a(n-1)}{n^2} }{b + \frac{4.5 a}{0.5+n^2}} \right]$$

365770,What is a simple example of a limit in the real world?,"This morning, I read Wikipedia's informal definition of a limit: Informally, a function f assigns an output $f(x)$ to every input $x$. The
  function has a limit $L$ at an input $p$ if $f(x)$ is ""close"" to $L$ whenever
  $x$ is ""close"" to $p$. In other words, $f(x)$ becomes closer and closer to $L$
  as $x$ moves closer and closer to $p$. To me that sounds like something that might be better described as a 'target'. If I take a simple function, say one that only multiplies the input by $2$; and if my limit is $10$ at an input $5$: then I've described something that seems to match the elements contained in Wikipedia's definition. I don't believe that that's right. To me it looks like an elementary-algebra problem ($2p = 10$). To make it more calculusy, I could graph the function's output when I use inputs other than $p$, but that really wouldn't give me anything but an illustration of the fact that one's answer moves farther from the right answer as it becomes more wrong (go figure). So limits are important; what I've just described is trivial. I do not understand them. I know calculus is often used for solving real-world challenges, and that limits are an important element of calculus, so I assume there must be some simple real-world examples of what it is that limits describe. What is a simple example of a limit in the real world? Thank you -Hal.","['applications', 'calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'analysis', 'limits']"

In particularly, I'm looking at functions defined on the non-negative orthant of $\mathbb{R}^n$. I've been thinking that one could use tangent cones to such an end. The question is organised as follows, first are the standard definitions of a tangent cone and a differentiable function, then comes my candidate extension of differentiability and finally are the questions. Thank you very much in advanced (even if for just having a read!). EDIT: Does anyone think that this would be an appropriate (or not) question for MathOverflow? Tangent Cones: Let $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ and $x\in X$. Then the tangent cone to $X$ at $x$ , $T_X(x)$ is defined as the closure of the cone formed by all half-lines emanating from $x$ and intersecting $X$ in at least one point $y\in X$ distinct from $x$. Formally $$T_X(x)=\{0\}\cup\left\{y:y\neq0,\exists (x_k)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq X,\quad x_k\neq x\quad \forall k,\quad \frac{x_k-x}{||x_k-x||}\rightarrow\frac{y}{||y||}\right\}.$$ Differentiable function: Suppose $E$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $f$ is a function that maps $E$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$, and $x\in E$. If there exists a linear transformation $A$ from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ such that $$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{|f(x+h)-f(x)-A(h)|}{|h|}=0,$$ where $|\cdot|$ denotes any p-norm, then we say that $f$ is differentiable at $x$, and we write $$f'(x)=A.$$ Tentative extension of ""differentiability"": Suppose $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, $x\in X$ and $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m$. We say that $f$ is differentiable at $x$ if there exists a ""pseudo-linear"" transformation $\tilde{A}$ from $T_X(x)$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ such that for any sequence $$(h_k)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\subset T_X(x)$$ that satisfies $h_k\rightarrow 0$ as $k\rightarrow\infty$ $$\frac{|f(x+h)-f(x)-\tilde{A}(h)|}{|h|}=0,$$ then we say that $f$ is differentiable at $x$, and we write $$f'(x)=\tilde{A}.$$ By $\tilde{A}$ being pseudo-linear I mean that for any $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ and $x,y\in X$ such that $ax+by\in X$ $$\tilde{A}(ax+by)=a\tilde{A}(x)+b\tilde{A}(y).$$ Note that, because $x\in int(X)$ implies that $T_X(x)=\mathbb{R}^n$, the above definition coincides with the usual one if $X$ is open. My questions then are: Does the above notion of a differentiable function and its derivative already exist? If so what is it called? Or is there a more general notion for which the above is a special case? If 1., does there exist an analogue of the chain rule that applies to it? Similarly, if $\tilde{A}$ is a continuous, is there an easy way to compute the $\tilde{A}$ in the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (much in the same way we use the partial derivatives to compute the derivative of a continuously differentiable functions)? Similarly, can one extend a differentiable (in the sense above) function on $X$ to a differentiable (in the usual sense) function on $\mathbb{R}^n$? Is there any reason why any or all the above could not be answered affirmatively (for example, something that does not make sense in the derivative)? Any answers or references that might contain them would be greatly appreciated.
