1767551,Justifying the differentiation property of the Fourier transform,"Let the Fourier transform of $f\in L^1(\Bbb R)$, denoted by $\mathcal{F}f$, be defined as $$ \mathcal{F}f(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-ixy} f(x)\,dx.$$ An oft-quoted result is that if $f,f'\in L^1(\Bbb R)$, then $$ \mathcal{F}(f')(y) = iy\mathcal{F}f(y).\tag{1}$$ This is justified with integration by parts: $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-ixy}f'(x)\,dx = \left.\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-ixy}f(x)\right|_{-\infty}^{\infty} +iy\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-ixy}f(x)\,dx.\tag{2}$$ The association between $(1)$ and $(2)$ is predicated on $f$ going to zero at $\pm\infty$, however there are plenty of differentiable $L^1$ functions which do not go to zero at infinity, e.g. take a compactly supported smooth function with support of width $\frac{1}{4}$, then center dilated copies of it at the integers with decreasing width away from zero. You could find a sequence of function values which never goes to zero in this case. If $f$ were absolutely continuous, then it seems to me that this should be true since we would have (for any fixed $a$): $$ f(x) = \int_a^x f'(y)\,dy + f(a).$$ Taking a limit as $x$ tends to infinity would give that $$ f(\infty) = \int_a^{\infty} f'(y)\,dy + f(a).$$ Each quantity on the right hand side is well-defined and so $f(\infty)$ is  a constant, but the only constant it could be (to retain integrability) would be zero. However without assuming absolute continuity this seems no-go since if $f$ was the Cantor function, $f' \equiv 0$ almost everywhere so the left hand size of $(2)$ is zero, the first term on the right hand side is zero since the Cantor function is compactly supported and the second term on the right hand side is nonzero since the Fourier transform is injective. (Unless of course I am mistaken about this.) What exactly are the right conditions for the association between $(1)$ and $(2)$ to hold (or where has my logic broken down)?","['lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'fourier-transform']"

1767833,"If $\sum a_n$ is convergent, is $\sum\frac{a_n}{n}$ absolutely convergent?","Assume that a series $\sum\limits_{n\geqslant1} a_n$ is convergent. Does this imply that $\sum\limits_{n\geqslant1}\frac{a_n}{n}$ is absolutely convergent? My first thought is no, but I'm having a hard time finding a counterexample. If there is a counterexample then it must be conditionally convergent, because if $\sum_n a_n$ is absolutely convergent then $\sum_n\frac{a_n}{n}$ clearly will be as well. The problem is I don't really know many examples of conditionally convergent series. Of course there's $\sum_n\frac{(-1)^n}{n}$, but that doesn't work. We can extend this to a class of conditionally convergent series $\sum_n\frac{(-1)^n}{n^p}$ for any $0<p\le1$, but none of these work either because we will simply get $\sum_n\frac{(-1)^n}{n^{p+1}}$, which will converge absolutely because $p+1>1$. So I'm feeling pretty stuck. Anybody have any good suggestions of conditionally convergent series for me to try? Or if my intuition is wrong and this happens to be true, can someone give me a hint on how I'd go about proving it?

$$f(x) = \int f'(x)dx = \int\frac{1}{x}dx = \ln(x) + C$$ Also, we are given that $f(1)=0$, so $f(1)=\ln(1)+C=0$, which gives us $C=0$. Therefore, $f(x)= \ln(x)$.

1767940,Density of a distribution given by a Gaussian copula and a set of marginals,"Suppose the distribution of an $n$-dimensional random vector $X$ is characterized by a Gaussian copula $C_R$ with correlation matrix $R$ and a set of marginal $\{(F_{X_i}, f_{X_i})\}_{i=1}^n$ (pairs of a distribution function and a density function). I would like to derive the probability density of $X$. Wikipedia says that the density of the copula is as follows: $$
f_{C_R}(u)
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\det{R}}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}\Phi^{-1}(u_1)\\ \vdots \\ \Phi^{-1}(u_n)\end{pmatrix}^T \cdot
\left(R^{-1}-I\right) \cdot
\begin{pmatrix}\Phi^{-1}(u_1)\\ \vdots \\ \Phi^{-1}(u_n)\end{pmatrix}

$$ Given this information, I decided to apply a change-of-variables transformation and, thereby, express the density of $X$ in terms of the density of $U \sim C_R$. I arrived at the following formula: $$
f_X(x) = \left| \prod_{i=1}^n f_{X_i}(x_i) \right| \, \, f_{C_R}\left(
\begin{pmatrix}F_{X_1}(x_1)\\ \vdots \\ F_{X_n}(x_n)\end{pmatrix}
\right) 
$$ The coefficient before $f_{C_R}$ is the absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian of the inverse of the transformation from $U$ to $X$, which is just an application of $\{F^{-1}_{X_i}\}$ to the corresponding elements of $U$. Since I do not have a proper background, I am not entirely sure should that all the steps that I have taken are legitimate. I, therefore, would be grateful if somebody could confirm that the above computations are correct. I also wonder why $f_{C_R}$ differs so much from the density of a centered multivariate Gaussian vector: $$
f_Y(y) =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^n \det{\Sigma}}}
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}y^\mathrm{T}\Sigma^{-1}y

By imposing one restriction, and then another, we can reduce the degrees of freedom by two, such that I end up with a 2D plane in 4D space, we can write this pair of restrictions in matrix form as: $$ \begin{bmatrix} p_1 & p_2 & p_3 & p_4 \\ q_1 & q_2 & q_3 & q_4  \end{bmatrix}

1768428,Does Nagata theorem hold in a field that is not algebraically closed?,"Let $R$ be a finitely generated $k$ - algebra and $G$ be a reductive group acting rationally on it. Then a theorem of Nagata says that the invariant ring $R^G$ is also finitely generated. Here $k$ is assumed to be algebraically closed. Would this be true if $k=\mathbb R$? EDIT 1 : As per the comment by Ariyan Javanpeykar I have tried to show that $R^G\otimes_\mathbb R\mathbb C\cong (R\otimes_\mathbb R\mathbb C)^G$ First of all if $G$ acts on $R$ then consider the action on $R\otimes\mathbb C$ given by $$g\cdot \sum_if_i\otimes\lambda_i=\sum_i(g\cdot f_i)\otimes \lambda_i$$
 Now since we have $R^G\hookrightarrow R$, we get the map $R^G\otimes\mathbb C\hookrightarrow R\otimes \mathbb C$ which is injective because $\mathbb C$ is flat over $\mathbb R$. Also, by the above action we see that this map takes $R^G\otimes\mathbb C\hookrightarrow(R\otimes\mathbb C)^G$. But I am unable to prove surjectivity. Also, assuming we have proved $R^G\otimes_\mathbb R\mathbb C\cong (R\otimes_\mathbb R\mathbb C)^G$ then why does $R^G\otimes_\mathbb R\mathbb C$ finitely generated $\mathbb C$ - algebra imply that $R^G$ is a finitely generated $\mathbb R$ - algebra? EDIT 2 : Thanks to this answer we have that $R^G\otimes_\mathbb R\mathbb C$ being a finitely generated $\mathbb C$ - algebra implies that $R^G$ is a finitely generated $\mathbb R$ - algebra. So all that is left now is to show that the map $R^G\otimes\mathbb C\hookrightarrow(R\otimes\mathbb C)^G$ is surjective. But I am still unable to do this.

1768442,Relationship between Möbius transformations and flows/vector fields,"I've noticed that the pictures illustrating the effect of Möbius transformations on the Riemann sphere (after stereographic projection to the plane) resemble the phase portrait of a vector field. For instance: This is the representation of a hyperbolic transformation (from Wikipedia ), and seems very similar to the phase portrait of a field generated by a positive and a negative charge located at the fixed points of the transformation (that is, of an irrotational and incompressible field). One could ever think of linking the fact that poles have integer order to the discretization of charges, using Gauss's divergence theorem. I guess the analogy arises from conformal mappings satisfying Laplace's equation, but I wonder how far can one push it. This is where I'm doubting: in the example cited above, hyperbolic transformations are the stereographic projection of discrete rotations of the sphere. In general, Möbius transformations are discrete mappings from the Riemann sphere to itself, whereas a vector field suggests a continuous flow. Could we rigorously obtain a one-parameter subgroup of continuous transformations from those infinitesimal, discrete transformations, and could we define a (unique) vector field corresponding to this continuous subgroup (for example, writing each transformation as a differential equation)?

I can define one atlas $\mathfrak U = \{(U_i,\phi_i)\}_{i=1}^4$ for $S^1$ by letting $U_1,U_2$ be the upper and lower semicircles, respectively, and defining $\phi_i(x,y) = x$ for $i = 1,2$,

1768615,Uniform unboundedness of linear operators,"Question: Suppose that $(T_k)_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of invertible linear operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Suppose that $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}\setminus \{0\}$, we have $$\lim_{k\to\infty} \|T_k x\| = \infty .$$ Let $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ denote the unit sphere. Then does it follow that $$\lim_{k\to \infty} \inf_{x \in \mathbb{S}^{n-1}}\|T_k x\| = \infty? $$ Stated another way, is the sequence uniformly unbounded on the unit sphere? Some of my thoughts so far: (1) My question seems almost (but not quite) the converse of the Banach-Steinhaus theorem in the special setting of finite-dimensional vector spaces. (2) Uniform unboundedness in the above question is equivalent to convergence of the sequence $$\lim_{k\to\infty} \sup_{x \in \mathbb{S}^{n-1}} \frac{1}{\|T_k x\|} = 0.$$
If I could prove that the sequence $(1/\|T_k x\|)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ (with $x$ in the unit sphere) was uniformly bounded and equicontinuous , then the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem together with pointwise convergence of $(1/\|T_k x\|)_{k=1}^{\infty}$ to zero would imply the result. (3) Since we are working in $\mathbb{R}^n$, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ we may write $T_k$ in terms of its singular value decomposition (SVD) : $T_k = U_k \Sigma_k V_k^T$. If $\|T_k x\|$ did not tend uniformly to $\infty$ on the unit sphere, then the smallest singular values of $\Sigma_k$ would have to be bounded, say, by $K > 0$. Denoting by $v_k^n$ the last column of $V_k$, we then have that $\forall k: \|T_k v_k^n\| < K$. Compactness of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ would then allow me to extract a convergent subsequence from $(v_k^n)_{k=1}^\infty$, but I'm not sure how to make this useful. (4) A geometric interpretation of my question is the following. For each $k$, the image of the unit sphere $T_k(\mathbb{S}^{n-1})$ is an ellipsoid $E_k$. The hypothesis that $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n\setminus \{0\}: \lim_{k\to \infty} \|T_k x\| = \infty$ implies that for any point $x \in \mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, the sequence of points $T_k x \in E_k$ grows unbounded in norm. It then seems geometrically intuitive to me that this can only happen if the length of the smallest ""semi-axis"" of the ellipsoids $E_k$ tend to $\infty$, which is equivalent to saying that $\lim_{k\to \infty} \inf_{x \in \mathbb{S}^{n-1}}\|T_k x\| = \infty. $ However, I haven't been able to turn this into a proof, and perhaps my intuition is misguided.

1768850,A necessary and sufficient condition for the admittance of integrating factor,"Let $\omega$ be a smooth 1-form on a smooth manifold $M$. A smooth positive function $\mu$ on some open subset $U\subset M$ is called an integrating factor for $\omega$ if $\mu\omega$ is exact on U. In Lee's ISM, there is a necessary and sufficient condition for a nonvanishing 1-form to admit integrating factor. If $\omega$ is nowhere-vanishing, then $\omega$ admits an integrating factor in a
  neighborhood of each point if and only if $d\omega \wedge \omega \equiv 0$. I have no idea how to prove the ""if"" part. Assume $d\omega \wedge \omega \equiv 0$ and that $\omega$ is nowhere-vanishing. What does these conditions tell us about $\omega$ and how can we construct a smooth positive function $\mu$ on some open neighborhood $U$ of any point $p$? Partial solution: Ted indicates that I need to use the Frobenius theorem for the proof. I assume the version of Frobenius theorem is the following one in Warner's book: Let $\mathcal I \subset E^*(M)$ be a differential ideal locally generated by $d-p$ independent 1-forms. Let $m\in M$. Then there exists a unique maximal, connected, integral manifold of $\mathcal I$ through $m$, and this integral manifold has dimension $p$. For any $m\in M$, we want to prove that there exists a smooth positive function $\mu$ on some open subset $m\in U\subset M$ such that $\mu\omega$ is exact on U. To use the Frobenius theorem, we need a involutive distribution $\mathcal D$ and let $\mathcal I:=\mathcal {I(D)}$(annihilator of $\mathcal D$). But what is our $\mathbb D$? What good can the existence of a unique maximal, connected, integral manifold of $\mathcal I$ through $m$ do to us in order to find $\mu$?

1768961,"Computing the ""Mean Value"" of a Point Sample From an Arbitrary Manifold","A friend of mine noticed that taking the ""mean"" of two points on the circle isn't as easy as just computing the arithmetic mean of their arguments: If one point has argument $-3.13$ radians and one point has argument $3.13$, the mean value of the arguments is zero, while it would be more intuitive to have the ""mean"" around (roughly) $3.14$. Of course, zero is also a suitable mean value for good reasons, but $3.14$ feels closer visually, because it minimizes the distances to the sample points. Also, note that means may not be unique, as two antipodal points have two visually appealing candidates for means. Needless to say, this problem can be solved algorithmically, which I have done with an ad-hoc $n\log(n)$ algorithm, but that is out of scope for this post (so I'll pull a Fermat and leave that as an exercise for the ambitious reader). What I wonder is instead how one can go about generalizing this notion of ""taking means"" to points sampled from arbitrary manifolds. By manifolds, I mean Riemannian manifolds specifically, to have a local metric available. If any other type of manifold would work just as well or better, feel free to comment. So what I want is some way to, given a sample of points $\{p_1,\ldots,p_n\}$ on a manifold $M$, compute another point $p \in M$ that minimizes the sum of the deviations between the actual sample and $p$, where the deviations are computed as (oriented?) geodesic distances along M . Or something of the sort, at least, sorry if this is a vague formulation. Intuitively, I can imagine a lot of nonlinear optimization, optimal control theory and possibly calculus of variations coming into play, but I can only speculate at this point. Are there any references out there where I can read up on how to compute these ""means""?","['riemannian-geometry', 'optimal-control', 'statistics', 'soft-question', 'calculus-of-variations']"

I tried one argument similar to that used with the Helmholtz equation. In that case the equation is: $$\nabla^2\psi+k^2\psi=f,$$ In that case the Green's function satisfies $$\nabla^2G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_0)+k^2G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_0)=\delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0)$$ If we then write this equation for $G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_i)$ with $i=1,2$ and then we multiply the first by $G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_2)$, multiply the second by $G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_1)$ and subtract, we get emplyoing Green's second identity that: $$G(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2)-G(\mathbf{r}_2,\mathbf{r}_1)=\int_{S}[G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_2)\nabla G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_1)-G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_1)\nabla G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_2)]\cdot \operatorname{d\mathbf{S}}$$ Thus, considering Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on $S$ we see that the integral vanishes so that $G(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2)=G(\mathbf{r}_2,\mathbf{r}_1)$. Now, I tried to mimic this to the more general case, but the $p$ function stops us from applying Green's second identity. I've been trying this for some time, but I haven't got any far.

I'm interested in the relationship between the magnitude of the derivative of a mapping $f \colon K \to D$ at the origin and the size of the largest disk it contains. Indeed such a $K$ must contain a disc about the origin, and if you assume that $|\,f(z)\,| > |\,z\,|$ for all $z \neq 0$ you get that $f$ increases the size of $K$, and also that $|\,f'(0)\,| > 1$. If you keep expanding $K$ by chaining these maps, the ""tail expansions"" from large domains to $\mathbb{D}$ should look somewhat like rotations, I think.

1769291,Number of solutions to $x^2\equiv b \bmod p^n$,"For an odd prime $p$ , and some integer $b,n$ . I'm interested in finding the number of solutions to $$x^2 \equiv b \bmod p^n$$ Researching this led me into Hensel's lemma but I want to verify I understood correctly. By Hensel's lemma, a solution $x_i$ to $f(x)\equiv 0 \bmod p^i$ lifts to a unique solution modulo $p^{i+1}$ if and only if $p\nmid f'(x_i)$ .
In the given case, $f'(x_i)=2x_i$ . Thus if $x_1$ is a solution for $x^2\equiv b \text{ mod } p$ , then $p\nmid f'(x_1)$ and a $x_1$ will lift to a single solution, which will keep lifting using the same idea as always $x_i\equiv x_1\text{ mod } p$ which means that always $p\nmid x_i$ and $p\nmid 2x_i$ . Does that mean that the original congruence will always have exactly two solutions if $b$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$ or am I doing something wrong?","['number-theory', 'modular-arithmetic', 'quadratic-residues']"

Also, we have that $x$ involves only $a,c,e,g \in (-\infty,\infty)$ and $y$ involves only $b,d,f,h \in (0, \infty)$. The numerator factors as $256bdfh(e-g)$ times $$a^5 + 2 a^3 b^2 + a b^4 - 3 a^4 c - 2 a^2 b^2 c + b^4 c + 3 a^3 c^2 -

 Then $Aut(G)=\{\varphi_{1},\cdots,\varphi_{n}\}$
