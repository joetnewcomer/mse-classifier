3654315,Establishing $\frac{ \sin mx}{\sin x}=(-4)^{(m-1)/2}\prod_{1\leq j\leq(m-1)/2}\left(\sin^2x-\sin^2\frac{2\pi j}{m}\right) $ for odd $m$,"Let $m$ be an odd positive integer. Prove that $$ \dfrac{ \sin (mx) }{\sin x } = (-4)^{\frac{m-1}{2}} \prod_{1 \leq j
 \leq \frac{(m-1)}{2} }  \left( \sin^2 x - \sin^2 \left( \dfrac{ 2 \pi
 j }{m } \right) \right) $$ Atempt to the proof My idea is to use induction on $m$ . The base case is $m=3$ and we obtain $$ \dfrac{ \sin (3x) }{\sin x } = (-4) ( \sin^2 x - \sin^2 (2 \pi /3 ) ) $$ and this holds if one uses the well known $\sin (3x) = 3 \sin x - 4 \sin^3 x $ identity. Now, if we assume the result is true for $m = 2k-1$ , then we prove it holds for $m=2k+1$ . We have $$ \dfrac{ \sin (2k + 1) x }{\sin x } = \dfrac{ \sin [(2k-1 + 2 )x] }{\sin x } = \dfrac{ \sin[(2k-1)x ] \cos (2x) }{\sin x } + \dfrac{ \cos [(2k-1) x ] \sin 2x }{\sin x }  $$ And this is equivalent to $$ cos(2x) \cdot (-4)^{k-1} \prod_{1 \leq j
 \leq k-1  }\left( \sin^2 x - \sin^2 \left( \dfrac{ 2 \pi
 j }{m } \right) \right) + 2 \cos [(2k-1) x ] \cos x $$ Here I dont see any way to simplify it further. Am I on the right track?",['trigonometry']
3654336,Is this a sublattice?,"I had a question in a previous year paper of discrete maths. It asked-
""Determine all the sub-lattices of D30 that contain at least four elements, D30={1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30}.

I came up with the following hasse diagram: The hasse diagram looks like a cube projected in 2D and from what I understand, every face of this cube should be a valid sublattice with atleast 4 elements, what other sublattices exist with 4 or more elements?
And another aside question, is {1,2,3,6} a valid sublattice in this case, because i think it is but the answer key says otherwise. A photo of answer key is also attached. But I think there is something wrong with this answer key altogether because it does not list the whole lattice itself (i.e. all the elements of lattice) as a valid sublattice having greater than 4 elements.

3654505,Confusion on the kernel and image of boundary map in terms of computing simplicial homology.,"I am learning simplicial homology, and I have a confusion on the computation. I understand that the boundary map  the boundary map $\partial_{n}:C_{n}(X)\longrightarrow C_{n-1}(X)$ takes the form $$\partial\langle V_{0},\cdots, V_{n}\rangle=\sum_{i=0}^{n}(-1)^{i}\langle V_{0},\cdots,\widehat{V}_{i},\cdots, V_{n}\rangle,$$ where $\widehat{V}_{i}$ means you kick out $V_{i}$ coordinate and keep other coordinates and $\langle V_{0},\cdots, V_{n}\rangle$ is the vertices of $n-$ dimensional simplex $\Delta^{n}$ . I also know how to prove that $\partial_{n}\circ \partial_{n+1}=0$ so that you have a chain complex. Then the simplicial homology is defined by $$H_{k}(X)=\ker(\partial_{k})/Im(\partial_{k+1}).$$ However, I don't know how to compute the $\ker$ and $Im$ . For instance, let us take the $2-$ dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^{2}$ as an example: Consider the well-known triangulation of $\mathbb{T}^{2}$ , see here: Computing the first simplical homology group of the torus $H_1(T)$ We have $9$ copies of $\Delta^{0}$ , $8$ copies of $\Delta^{1}$ and $18$ copies of $\Delta^{2}$ . Thus, $C_{2}(X)=\mathbb{Z}^{18}$ , $C_{1}(X)=\mathbb{Z}^{8}$ and $C_{0}(X)=\mathbb{Z}^{9}$ . Hence, we have chain complex $$C_{2}(X)=\mathbb{Z}^{18}\longrightarrow_{\partial_{2}} C_{1}(X)=\mathbb{Z}^{8}\longrightarrow_{\partial_{1}}C_{0}(X)=\mathbb{Z}^{9}.$$ Now, we compute the $\partial_{2}$ and $\partial_{1}$ , we have $$\partial_{2}\langle V_{0},V_{1},V_{2}\rangle=\langle V_{1},V_{2}\rangle -\langle V_{0}, V_{2}\rangle+\langle V_{1}, V_{2}\rangle$$ and $$\partial_{1}\langle V_{0}, V_{1}\rangle=\langle V_{1}\rangle-\langle V_{0}\rangle.$$ But then, what is the image and kernel of $\partial_{1}$ and $\partial_{2}$ ? Thank you! Edit 1: (Update) As comments pointed out, the group is so large since the simplex is complicated, and thus we need to use sage to compute it. However, the point is that I don't understand how to write down the matrix representation of $\partial_{1}$ and $\partial_{2}$ . Let me reduce this simplex to this: The simplex is from Hatcher's book. Then he argued that: There is one vertex, three edges $a,b,c$ and two $2-$ simplices U and L. Then $\partial_{1}=0$ and $\partial_{2}U=a+b-c=\partial_{2}L$ , and $\{a,b, a+b-c\}$ is a basis for $\Delta_{1}(T)$ , it follows that $H_{1}(T)=\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}$ . Since there are no $3-$ simplices, $H_{2}(T)=\ker\partial_{2}$ , which is infinite cyclic generated by $U-L$ . I don't understand how he got $\partial_{1}=0$ . Given my computation above, $\partial_{1}\langle V_{0},V_{1}\rangle=\langle V_{1}\rangle-\langle V_{0}\rangle$ why $0$ ? I also don't understand how he saw that $\{a,b,a+b-c\}$ is the basis for $\Delta_{1}(T)$ . Finally, how to compute $\ker\partial_{2}$ ?","['geometric-topology', 'abstract-algebra', 'homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-topology']"

I asked this to someone he said the above said limit can be written as the integral $$\int_{0}^{x} \ln(1 +t^2) dt$$ And I really don’t know how and it’s my question to know how.

3654648,"On an $n\times n$ grid, with white and black tiles: is there always a connected path across the grid?","Assume you have an $n\times n$ grid, and a set W of white and a set B of black tiles that are placed randomly on this grid. I think that at least one of the sets W, B must include a connected path of tiles from one side of the grid to the opposite side of the grid. What I mean by connected path: the tiles have the same color, and they are pairwise neighbors to each other (each pair of them shares an edge or a vertex). I think such a connected path, connecting one side of the grid with the opposite side, must be included in B or W, regardless of the distribution of tiles. I suspect it is sufficient to prove this for the case when W and B have equal size $n^2/2$ . I also suspect that one could start from a chess board style pattern, and go from there to cover all other distributions of black and white tiles. Finally, I suspect the Pigeon Hole Principle might prove it in one go; but I have not found the right entry point to this route.

I am interested in the point of 'cross-over' between a generalised harmonic number where the denominator of the summand is raised to a power, and a non-exponential harmonic sum operating on some subset of the natural numbers.

Clearly, there exist values of $x,k$ such that $G_x<H_x^{(k)}$ and values such that $H_x^{(k)}<G_x$ . Thus there exists a value $c=G_{x_0}$ such that $$G_{x_0}=c<H_{x_0}^{(k)}=\sum_{n=1}^x \frac{1}{n^k}$$ and $$H_{{x_0}+2}^{(k)}<G_{{x_0}+2}=c+\frac{1}{2x_0+1}+\frac{1}{2x_0+3}$$ or $$H_{{x_0}+2}^{(k)}-c<\frac{1}{2x_0+1}+\frac{1}{2x_0+3}$$ The values of $c,x_0,k$ are obviously co-dependent.

1.Maybe we can consider finite-rank operators. If we can prove $\phi$ keeps rank-one operators, then it will keep finite-rank operators, and thus keep compact operators by the density and continuity. 
2.The ideal $\mathcal{K}$ formed by all compact operators is a minimal nonzero closed ideal of $B(\mathcal{H})$ , and $\phi(\mathcal{K})$ is a closed ideal of $B(\mathcal{H})$ .

\left\{\,
\begin{aligned}
&y'' +\frac{y'}{y^2} \epsilon - y' = 0,\qquad -\infty<x<\infty\\[1mm]
&y(-\infty) = 1, \ y(\infty)=\epsilon

\right.
$$ Then, study the asymptotic behaviour of its solution for $\,x<0\,$ and $\,x\approx 0\,$ using the equation. Check the results comparing with the exact solution. My solution To solve the problem, we reduce the order introducing a constant $\,C$ $$
y' - \frac{\epsilon}{y} - y = C.
$$ It is easy to see that the general solution does not satisfy the conditions at infinity if we set $\,C=0$ . Setting $\,C\neq 0\,$ and knowing $\,y\not\equiv 0$ , we can integrate the previous equation as follows $$
\int\frac{y\,dy}{y^2 + Cy + \epsilon} = x + D.
$$ We notice that if $\,C^2 - 4\epsilon < 0\,$ then $\,y^2 + Cy + \epsilon > 0\,$ because $$
y^2 + Cy + \epsilon = \left(y + \frac{C}{2}\right)^2 +\epsilon - \frac{C^2}{4}
$$ and we can compute the integral as (step by step integration omitted) $$
\int\frac{y\,dy}{y^2 + Cy + \epsilon} = \log\sqrt{y^2+Cy+\epsilon\,} - \frac{C}{\sqrt{4\epsilon - C^2}}\,\text{atan}\!\left(\frac{2y + C}{\sqrt{4\epsilon - C^2}}\right).
$$ The expression above does not verify the boundary conditions. Therefore, let's assume the opposite, i.e, $\,C^2-4\epsilon\geq0$ . If $C^2=4\epsilon$ , $$
\int\frac{y\,dy}{y^2 + Cy + \epsilon} = \int\frac{y\,dy}{(y+C/2)^2} = -\frac{y}{y+C/2} + \log\,\left|y+\frac{C}{2}\right|
$$ but $$
\lim_{x\to-\infty}\exp\left(-\frac{y(x)}{y(x) + C/2}\right)\cdot\left|y(x)+\frac{C}{2}\right| = 0 = \lim_{x\to-\infty}Ke^x 
$$ if and only if $\,C = -2$ . This means $\,\epsilon = 1$ , which is a contradiction. The only possibility left is $\,C^2-4\epsilon>0$ , thus $$
y^2 + Cy + \epsilon = (y - y_1)(y - y_2),
$$ where $\,y_1 > y_2\,$ and $\,C = - y_1 - y_2$ , $\,\epsilon = y_1y_2$ . We have to remark that $\,y(x)>0\,$ for all $\,x\in\mathbb{R}$ . Otherwise, it'd exist $x_0$ such that $y(x_0)=0$ and the equation would make no sense. Assuming $\,y_1>y_2>0$ , $$
\int\frac{y\,dy}{y^2 + Cy + \epsilon} = \int\frac{A}{y - y_1}\,dy\, + \int\frac{B}{y - y_2}\,dy = \frac{1}{y_1 - y_2}\log\frac{|y - y_1|^{y_1}}{|y - y_2|^{y_2}}
$$ and back again, we apply the condition when $\,x\to-\infty\,$ to $$
\lim_{x\to-\infty} \frac{|y(x) - y_1|^{y_1}}{|y(x) - y_2|^{y_2}} = 0  = \lim_{x\to-\infty} Ke^{(y_1 - y_2)x}.
$$ We deduce $\,y_1 = 1$ , hence $\,y_2 = \epsilon\,$ and $\,C = -1 - \epsilon$ . It is easy to prove that the solution verifies the condition at $\,\infty$ . Furthermore, considering the roots $y_1, y_2$ , the equation has the form $$
yy' = (y-1)(y-\epsilon),
$$ and it can be proved $\,y(x)$ stays between $\,y_1$ and $\,y_2$ . So, we can assure $$
\frac{1 - y(x)}{(y(x) - \epsilon)^\epsilon} = Ke^{(1-\epsilon)x}.
$$ I do not obtain a closed formula for $y(x)$ and the last equality still depends on $K$ , so how am I supposed to compare the asymptotic behaviour with the exact solution? Thanks in advance for the help.","['asymptotics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'perturbation-theory']"

3655624,(Soft Question) What kinds of properties are transferred by isomorphisms?,"In many, many different areas of math, we define abstract objects and structure-preserving maps between them, and then come across a suitable notion of ""isomorphism."" The idea is always that isomorphic objects share every property that a mathematician in that field would care about: Homeomorphic topological spaces have all their topological properties in common, group isomorphisms have all their group-theoretic properties in common, and so on. But at the end of the day, we still have to verify by hand that any given property is preserved by an isomorphism in the category we're working in. For example, say we're working in group theory. It is intuitively obvious that under an isomorphism $\phi : G \to H$ , corresponding elements have the same order, compose in the same way, $\phi$ takes subgroups to subgroups, normal subgroups to normal subgroups, centers to centers, and any group constructed out of $G$ (direct/semidirect products, quotients, etc) should yield an isomorphic result when $G$ is replaced by $H$ . (These are just a few of many examples.) It feels like it should be the case that all of these properties correspond between $G$ and $H$ , but nonetheless we have to verify each of them one at a time. The proofs are never hard, and they suggest that there must be a more general way to think about them--some sort of big theorem that says that all ""group-theoretic properties"" can be transferred from one group to another by an isomorphism. How could we make this idea rigorous? How would we even define a ""group-theoretic property"", or analogously a ""topological property"" or a ""linear-algebraic property"" or a ""manifold property""? I would think the definition would stem from the idea that such properties are those that are phrased using only the structure of a group, (or a topological space, or a vector space, or a manifold); but this still seems imprecise. Assuming we could make this notion precise, could we then proceed to prove a general theorem that all such properties/objects are preserved by isomorphisms in the category we're working in, and then we don't have to tediously prove, for example, that group isomorphisms carry centers to centers, or homeomorphic spaces have the same number of conencted components, etc., because these would all fall out as special cases? Or is this a futile task? Maybe it so happens that there are weird examples of properties that seem like they should be preserved by isomorphisms but aren't, even though they are phrased using only the structure of the category. Math is full of pathologies, and at this point I can't seem to trust 100% that isomorphisms are these magic structure-preserving identifications that they are always made out to be.","['group-isomorphism', 'logic', 'category-theory', 'general-topology', 'soft-question']"

There is a nice geometrical proof of this fact that only uses the fact that the area of the whole sphere is $4\pi$ , and the intuitively obvious fact that two great circles that cut at an angle $\alpha$ (necessarily in two antipodal points), bound two slices whose common area is $4\alpha$ . To prove it, you can construct three such (pairs of) regions, that together disjointly cover the sphere except for the triangle and its antipodal image, which are both triply covered, from which it follows. The following image, from Jeffrey Weeks' The Shape of Space , make it very clear: The corresponding fact for hyperbolic triangles (on the hyperbolic plane with curvature -1) is $$A = \pi - (\alpha + \beta + \gamma).$$ Would it be possible to prove this is a similar way? Obviously it cannot directly be related to the area of the whole space, but maybe it can be related to the area of some standard triangle, like the one all of whose angles are 0 and which can be realized in the upper half-plane model as the triangle bounded by a half circle centered on the real line and two vertical lines. You would just compute the area of this triangle once and for all. The kind of answer I would like to see is a proof in which you obtain the area of a general triangle in terms of this reference area in some clever way by applying isometries and the fact that the area of a disjoint union is the sum of the areas, and little more (no integration).","['area', 'surfaces', 'riemannian-geometry', 'geometry', 'hyperbolic-geometry']"

3655941,Existence of a Parallel Orthonormal Frame Implies Manifold is Flat?,"Suppose that $M$ is a Riemannian manifold with Levi-Cevita connection, $\nabla$ and a parallel global orthonormal frame $\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\}$ . This seems to imply that the Riemannian curvature endomorphism, $R(X_i,X_j)X_k$ vanishes by simple reasoning that $\nabla_{X_i}\nabla_{X_j}X_k = 0$ as the frame is parallel and similarly $\nabla_{[X_i,X_j]}X_k = 0$ . By linearity of the curvature endomorphism and the fact that the $X_i$ 's form a frame this implies the curvature endomorphism vanishes on all of $M$ . On the other hand, a Lie group with a bi-invariant metric exhibits such an orthonormal frame by pushing forward an orthonormal basis by left-multiplication. This resulting orthonormal frame, $\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\}$ , appears to be parallel since the connection defined by $\nabla_{Y}(a^iX_i) = Y(a^i)X_i$ ( $a^i$ are smooth component functions) by a quick calculation looks to be g-compatible and torsion free so that $\nabla X_i = 0$ ? As Lie groups under bi-invariant metrics can have positive sectional curvature this contradicts the reasoning in the previous paragraph. A second reformulation of the question is that symmetry of the connection and parallelism implies that $0 = \nabla_{X_i}X_j - \nabla_{X_j}X_i = [X_i,X_j]$ . The vanishing of these Lie brackets then implies that there exist global coordinates of $M$ , $x^i$ , whose coordinate vector fields are the orthonormal $X_i$ 's which again further implies the metric is flat. My guess is that having a parallel frame doesn't imply a manifold is flat but a parallel ON frame does. One cannot use Gram-Schmidt on a parallel non-ON frame to get an orthonormal one as this ruins the parallelism. The question remains as to why the Lie group example is not flat in general; are the left invariant vector fields provided not actually parallel?

All the variables are integers, so it shouldn't matter that as a function, it is discontinuous. (edit: I was corrected by @fleablood, that you can't differentiate of integers. What I meant was that after the differentiation, I'm only interested in the integers, because I'm using them as the lower and upper limit. But I realised that it is irrelevant regarding the problem. ) I was trying to find a formula for the sum of squares with an arbitrary lower limit: $\sum_{k=x}^n k^2$ , but could only find $\sum_{k=1}^n k^2= \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ , which works only if the lower limit is equal to 1 (or 0). I've discovered, that you can express the first more general sum as: $$\sum_{k=x}^n k^2 = \biggr(\frac{d}{dx}min(x,n+1)\biggr)\biggr(\sum_{k=1}^{-x} k^2+\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 - \sum_{k=1}^{x-1}k^2\biggr)$$ That means that I can express the more general sum of squares using the sums of squares with lower limit equal to 1. Therefore I can rewrite the expression as: $$\sum_{k=x}^n k^2 = \biggr(\frac{d}{dx}min(x,n+1)\biggr)\biggr(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}-\frac{x(x-1)(2x-1)}{6}\biggr)$$ I am happy with the expression in the right parentheses, but it only works with the alien-looking expression in the left parentheses, so I am trying to find an equal expression that uses only the basic operations. Since English is not my first language, I might have used some terms incorrectly or awkwardly. But I hope, that the question makes sense. Also I'm really not that good at math, so it is highly probable that I've made an error, or I'm doing it unnecessarily complicated. (edit 2: So I've found out that you can rewrite the expression in question as: $$\frac{d}{dx}min(x,n+1)=\frac{1}{2}\biggr(1-\frac{x-n-1}{|x-n-1|}\biggr)$$ - therefore the more general sum of squares can be rewriten as: $$\sum_{k=x}^n k^2 =\frac{1}{2}\biggr(1-\frac{x-n-1}{|x-n-1|}\biggr)\biggr(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}-\frac{x(x-1)(2x-1)}{6}\biggr)=\frac{(|x-n-1|-x+n+1)(n(n+1)(2n+1)-x(x-1)(2x-1))}{12|x-n-1|}$$ - So my new question: Is this the optimal formula? Meaning, is it the most practical one? When you need to sum squares starting with arbitrary lower limit, is this the formula, you would probably use? - end of edit 2)","['sums-of-squares', 'summation', 'functions', 'arithmetic']"

Let $C$ be a projective curve over a field $k$ (possibly singular), with irreducible components $C_1, ...

Then, show that $\chi(L \otimes F) - \chi(F)$ is the sum $\sum_{i=1}^n \deg(L\text{ on } C_i^{\operatorname{red}}) \cdot \operatorname{length}(F_{\eta_i})$ over $O_{C, \eta_i}$ . One hint is to reduce to when $F$ is scheme-theoretically supported on $C^{\operatorname{red}}$ , so we reduce to when $C$ is reduced. Another hint given is to write $L = O(\sum n_j p_j)$ , where the $p_j$ are regular points different from the associated points on $F$ . There are a few things I don't understand about this exercise. What exactly does "" $L$ on $C_i^{\operatorname{red}}$ "" mean? $L$ is a sheaf on $C$ , not $C_i^{\operatorname{red}}$ . Is it that we take $\deg(i^* L)$ where $i : C_i^{\operatorname{red}} \rightarrow C$ is the usual closed immersion? What does it mean that "" $F$ is scheme-theoreteically supported on $C^{\operatorname{red}}$ ? Does this mean that $F$ is the pushforward of a sheaf $G$ on $C^{\operatorname{red}}$ along $i : C^{\operatorname{red}} \rightarrow C$ ? I don't know what $L = O(\sum n_j p_j)$ means nor why we can write it like this. Is $\sum n_j p_j$ a Weil divisor? The problem is that $C$ can be singular. The chapter on Weil divisors had a standing assumption that the scheme is regular in codimension 1. I don't know how to generalize Weil divisors to schemes that can be singular. Another question about $L = O(\sum n_j p_j)$ . The part about $p_j$ different from the associated points of $F$ . This suggests a relationship between $L$ and $F$ . What is that relationship?

3656235,"Computing $\textrm{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}_m , \mathbb{Z}_n)$","If we have a pair of Abelian groups $G$ and $H$ , I have been taught to compute the corresponding $\textrm{Ext}(G,H)$ groups in the following manner: We find a free resolution of $G$ ; i.e. a couple of free Abelian groups $F_0$ and $F_1$ and corresponding homomorphisms $f_0$ and $f_1$ so that: $$
0 \to F_1 \stackrel{f_1}\to F_0 \stackrel{f_0}\to G \to 0
$$ is a short exact sequence. We then dualise with respect to $H$ , to get the dual sequence: $$
0 \to \textrm{Hom}(G,H) \stackrel{f_0^*}\to \textrm{Hom}(F_0,H) \stackrel{f_1^*}\to \textrm{Hom}(F_1,H) \to 0,
$$ where $f_0^*$ and $f_1^*$ represent the naturally induced dual maps. The corresponding Ext groups are then defined as: $$
\textrm{Ext}^0(G,H) := \textrm{Ker}(f_1^*)
$$ and $$
\textrm{Ext}^1(G,H) := \textrm{Coker}(f_1^*).
$$ An example: We compute $\textrm{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z})$ : We note that: $$
0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot p}\to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{1 \mapsto 1}\to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
$$ is a free resolution of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ . We then dualise with respect to $\mathbb{Z}$ to obtain: $$
0 \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}) \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}) \stackrel{\cdot p^*}\to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}) \to 0,
$$ which, noting that $\cdot p^* = \cdot p$ , reduces to: $$
0 \to 0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot p}\to \mathbb{Z} \to 0.
$$ Hence: $$
\textrm{Ext}^0(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}) := \textrm{Ker}(\cdot p) = 0
$$ and $$
\textrm{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}) := \textrm{Coker}(\cdot p) = \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}.
$$ But now to the point: I want to compute $\textrm{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}_m,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ . For the sake of simplicity, let us first compute $\textrm{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q)$ for $p$ and $q$ distinct primes. A free resolution for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is given, as above, by: $$
0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot p}\to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{1 \mapsto 1}\to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
$$ Dualising with respect to $\mathbb{Z}_q$ gives us: $$
0 \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q) \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_q) \stackrel{\cdot p^*}\to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_q) \to 0,
$$ which necessarily must reduce to: $$
0 \to 0 \to 0 \stackrel{0}\to 0 \to 0,
$$ so that: $$
\textrm{Ext}^0(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q) := \textrm{Ker}(0) = 0
$$ and $$
\textrm{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q) := \textrm{Coker}(0) = 0.
$$ Now for the more general $\textrm{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}_m,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ . We have a free resolution of $\mathbb{Z}_m$ given by: $$
0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot m}\to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{1 \mapsto 1}\to \mathbb{Z}_m \to 0.
$$ Dualising with respect to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ yields: $$
0 \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_m,\mathbb{Z}_n) \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_n) \stackrel{\cdot m^*}\to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_n) \to 0,
$$ which reduces to: $$
0 \to \mathbb{Z}_d \to 0 \stackrel{0}\to 0 \to 0,
$$ where $d := \textrm{gcd}(m,n)$ . Hence, we again get trivial Ext groups. Now I know that the answer should be $\textrm{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_m,\mathbb{Z}_n) = \mathbb{Z}_d$ . This agrees with what we saw earlier, as $\gcd(p,q) = 1$ . I would much appreciate it if someone could tell me what I am doing wrong. Many thanks. Addendum: Grazie to Maxime Ramzi and Captain Lama for pointing out my mistake. I will here complete the computation, for the benefit of posterity: First the $p,q$ prime case: A free resolution for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is given, as above, by: $$
0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot p}\to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{1 \mapsto 1}\to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
$$ Dualising with respect to $\mathbb{Z}_q$ gives us: $$
0 \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q) \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_q) \stackrel{\cdot p^*}\to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_q) \to 0,
$$ which becomes: $$
0 \to 0 \to \mathbb{Z}_q \stackrel{\cdot p^*}\to \mathbb{Z}_q \to 0.
$$ Noting that $\cdot p^*: \mathbb{Z}_q \to \mathbb{Z}_q$ is a bijection, we get: $$
\textrm{Ext}^0(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q) := \textrm{Ker}(\cdot p^*) = 0
$$ and $$
\textrm{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p,\mathbb{Z}_q) := \textrm{Coker}(\cdot p^*) = 0.
$$ Now again for the more general $\textrm{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}_m,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ . We have a free resolution of $\mathbb{Z}_m$ given by: $$
0 \to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\cdot m}\to \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{1 \mapsto 1}\to \mathbb{Z}_m \to 0.
$$ Dualising with respect to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ yields: $$
0 \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}_m,\mathbb{Z}_n) \to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_n) \stackrel{\cdot m^*}\to \textrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_n) \to 0,
$$ which becomes: $$
0 \to \mathbb{Z}_d \to \mathbb{Z}_n \stackrel{\cdot m^*}\to \mathbb{Z}_n \to 0,
$$ where $d := \textrm{gcd}(m,n)$ . Hence: $$
\textrm{Ext}^0(\mathbb{Z}_m,\mathbb{Z}_n) := \textrm{Ker}(\cdot m^*) = \mathbb{Z}_d
$$ and $$
\textrm{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_m,\mathbb{Z}_n) := \textrm{Coker}(\cdot m^*) = \mathbb{Z}_d.

The motivation for this comes from mathematical programming-- specifically, an algorithm I'm writing that requires integrating the product of a large number of piecewise linear functions. What I would like is to find a closed form for $\mathfrak{P}(n)$ . Let's work through a few examples and see if a formula jumps out at us.

3656714,Predict Tens Digit in Multiplication Table. $7*8 =$ predict $5$ for tens. Rule for finding the pattern + Easy-Guess Trick for kindergarten kids.,"There is a perfect child-easy way to predict least significant digit (predict 6 for 7*8) for multiplication table. $7*8 = 56$ . We imagine digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 clockwise (as magic numbers on Harry Potter's magic clock) and then $7$ times
successively count $8$ numbers (clockwise, starting from $1$ ). After $7$ th count we land exactly on $6$ . Credits and thanks to J.-E. Pin and Will Orrick from this site. Besides, something very interesting was suggested by Bill Dubuque (see comments below), but I'm in the process of trying to approach and grasp it yet - it is very complicated (group theory/ cyclic groups and star polygons / spirograph curves (roulette curves)). But is there any reasonable child-friendly logic to quickly predict the tens digit (number of tens)? (without actual calculation) As above, we can just count number of times we cross $0$ (zero) in the clock. This would give the tens digit. Can we further simplify the way of finding number of crossing zero while doing those $7$ loops (counting $8$ successive numbers) on that Harry-Potter Clock? Number of crossing zero forms what sequence and how can it be easily constructed? Besides, there is a method in Wikipedia (it helps with the last digit, but does not help with the tens digit and is much more complicated than Harry Potter Magic Clock above). Maybe there is a simpler method - based on that we know the last digit (least significant digit) and both numbers being multiplied? (for a child it is difficult to count two things at once - number of transitions across zero and counting $8$ numbers in a row again and again in succession). There are some patterns, but formulating an easy rule beats me. Still, this is a very interesting academic question to me. Besides being a challenge to give full power of math (multiplication table) to kindergarten Einsteins at once to stimulate them (before just rot memorizing).

3656902,"A monotone convergence theorem for nets in Reed and Simon, Vol. I","Reed and Simon state the following monotone convergence theorem for nets (Theorem IV.15, Vol. I). Let $\mu$ be a regular Borel measure on a compact Hausdorff space $X$ . Let $\{f_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in I}$ be an increasing net of continuous functions. Then, $f=\lim_\alpha f_\alpha \in L^1(X,d\mu)$ if and only if $\sup_\alpha \| f_\alpha \|_1 < \infty$ and in that case $\lim_\alpha \|f-f_\alpha\|_1 = 0 $ . Unfortunately, they do not give a proof. Can anyone provide one, or give a reference to one? In the notes to the chapter containing the theorem, Reed and Simon cite Bourbaki's Integration, but I've found that text difficult to navigate. I do not have access to the other text they cite (Nachbin). This is not quite your classical monotone convergence theorem , as it requires each $f_\alpha$ to be continuous. This is necessary in order to rule out common counter-examples (see, for instance, this question or these answers ) to the statement of the dominated convergence theorem for nets instead of sequences. I could try adapting a usual proof for the MCT. However, I don't quite see the role that continuity of the $f_\alpha$ 's play in the result, so I'm not sure how to make use of it. Also, I'm not actually certain that the hypotheses of the theorem rule out the example here . I suspect the monotonicity requirement would get in the way of choosing the net of functions required in the example, but I don't have a proof of that either.

Consider the equivalence relation on the set M \begin{equation}

Informally speaking, $ N $ is obtained from $ M $ (by contracting the fibers of the bundle $ \pi $ to points). The set $ N $ is a disjoint union $ N = X \sqcup M^{\circ} $ of the manifold $ X $ and the interior $ M^{\circ} $ of $ M $ . The natural projection of $$ p: M \longrightarrow N $$ coincides with the identity map on $ M ^ {\circ} $ and the projection $ \pi $ on $ \partial M $ .

Then this is supposed to prove that it isn't uniformly continuous on $(0,1)$ ? What I was thinking is that wouldn't this be practically identical to choosing some fixed $x=\frac{1}{3}$ and $y=\frac{1}{2}$ , then we can again find a $\delta$ such that $|\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{2}|<\delta$ which implies that $1<\frac{1}{2}$ again.

Intuitively speaking, we would want to find some $\delta$ that works for all $x,y$ , however I don't see how the choice of $\delta$ satisfying $|\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}|<\delta$ works for all $x,y$ as any choice of $n$ will not give you every combination of $x,y$ , one because there exists rationals that cannot be written in such a form and the irrationals are also dense in the reals.

Where in the finite-dimensional setting we can say, ""every matrix has a characteristic polynomial, so it must have at least one eigenvalue over $\mathbb{C}$ because the characteristic polynomial will split"", once we move to even a separable space like $\ell^p(\mathbb{N})$ , we can lose that luxury.

$ Given any sets $S,T$ , if $\pow(S) ≈ \pow(T)$ then $S ≈ T$ .

The motivation is to find some algebraic statement that has no set-theoretic flavour but is sensitive to set-theoretic assumptions. I know that if GCH holds, then (★) also holds. Proof : For every $\qq$ -vector space $V$ with basis $B$ we have that $\end(V)$ has the same cardinality as $(B×\qq)^B ≈ \qq^B$ (because $(B×\qq)^B$ $\inj (2×\qq)^{B×B}$ $≈ \qq^{B×B}$ , and $B×B ≈ B$ if $B$ is infinite). Now take any infinite-dimensional $\qq$ -vector spaces $V,W$ such that $\end(V)$ embeds into $\end(W)$ . Let $B,C$ be bases for $V,W$ respectively. Then $\qq^B \inj \qq^C$ and so $2^B \inj \qq^B \inj \qq^C \inj 2^C$ , and hence $B \inj C$ by GCH, yielding an embedding of $V$ into $W$ . But does ZFC already prove (★)? If not, is there some well-known set-theoretic axiom weaker than GCH that implies (★) over ZFC?","['vector-spaces', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'provability', 'set-theory']"
3657819,About an inequality between the real part and absolute value of an operator,"When dealing with operators on a Hilbert Space, one can define for $A\in\mathcal{B} (\mathcal{H})$ two natural notions imitating the real part and absolute value of a complex number $$ Re(A) = \frac{A+A^*}{2}, \; \vert A \vert = \sqrt{A^* A}$$ We also have an order relation on self adjoint operators. Some natural inequalities of these objects (say $\vert A \vert \leq \Vert A \Vert I$ ) hold, but one that I find particularly tempting is: $$ Re(A) \leq \vert A \vert $$ or even better $$ \vert Re(A) \vert \leq \vert A \vert $$ My question is whether the last two inequlities are true in general For example, this would easily give the fact that any trace class operator decomposes into 4 positive trace class operators. The proof of this fact I saw is somewhat tricky and relies on different methods.","['c-star-algebras', 'inequality', 'operator-theory', 'functional-analysis']"
