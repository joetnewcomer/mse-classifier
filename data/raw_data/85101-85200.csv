1119926,Question regarding a proof of the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz,"N. Vishnoi has provided a slick proof of the combinatorial nullsetellensatz at http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/nvishno/site/publications_files/valon.pdf . The part that I am not understanding is towards the end where he says: ""It is easy to see, as in the expansion of h, each term must be of the type $qg_i$."" I am not sure why each term in $h$'s expansion is of that form. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.",['combinatorics']
1119930,Should a reflection matrix of a vector have the same form as a rotation matrix?,"According to the book: I know that it is not possible to write a reflection as a rotation, but from the text it seems that the matrix of the form $$ A=\left[
  \begin{array}{ c c }

  \end{array} \right]
$$ is the most general form of $O(2)$ since the way it results in $A$ doesn't show any specification of rotation; on the other hand, I can't find any pair of $a,b$ such that $$ A=\left[

1120155,Measure Theory Book for My Background / Need,"My current Math background is as follows: 1) Read first 7 chapters of Rudin ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis"" and solved a lot of the given problems. 2) Completed Munkres ""Analysis on Manifolds"" cover to cover and solved a lot of given problems. 3) Also read Rosenlicht ""Introduction to Analysis"" and solved a lot of its problems.

I am not sure that which Measure Theory book will best suit my needs: 1) Since I am self-studying, I want a book that picks up from the very basics of Measure theory (i.e. it should not assume a math background more advanced than mine). 2) It should not skimp on rigor but should also be easy to read (i.e. the proofs do not skip huge amounts of steps, which would be very bad for me since I will be studying by myself). 3) It would be helpful if the book has informative problems, to which I may be able to find solutions if I absolutely need to. 4) Also it would be great if the book has a chapter on Probability Theory.

Also why $f'(2)$ and not $f'(x)$? Right since we have a ""if and only if"" so that $f'(2)=0$ is not a necessary condition for that $f'(x)=0$ for $x\in(0,3)$?

1120264,Is there a way to define the concept of manifolds so it looks more like “generalised affine spaces”?,"What I have in mind is along the lines of this: Let $M$ a topological space, $V$ a normed vector space, and $$
  \boxminus \colon M\times M \to V,
$$
$$
  \boxplus \colon M\times V \to M.
$$ Then $M$ is called a manifold 1 with tangent space $V$ , if
$$
  p \boxplus (q \boxminus p) = q,
$$
$$
  p \boxplus \vec{0} = p
$$
and, for sufficiently small 2 vectors $v,w$,
$$
  (p \boxplus v) \boxplus w \approx p \boxplus (v+w).
$$ Can this set of axioms be made equivalent to the standard definition of manifolds (with an atlas of ball-homeomorphic neighbourhoods)? Note that rather than requiring the manifold to be locally homeomorphic to a ball in a vector space, I require it to be globally isomorphic to some subset of a vector space, in a way that's locally a homeomorphism. It sure seems to work for simple examples. Christian Blatter suggests $S^1$. Well, if we interpret that as $[0,1]$ with the ends glued together, then we can just define $\theta \boxminus \phi$ as $\theta - \phi$ folded back into the interval $[-\tfrac12, \tfrac12[ \subset V \equiv \mathbb{R}$, and $\theta \boxplus \delta$ as $\theta + \delta$ confined to $[0,1[$. The axioms hold; in fact $\boxplus$ is associative. The same works for tori of arbitrary dimension. For $S^2$ it immediately gets a bit messier, but I'd figure something Euler-angle-ish should do the trick in much the same way as in $S^1$. Where I'm uncertain is with multi-hole handlebodies, or Klein bottles etc. – and even if all those work, with the general case. 1 Evidently, this definition implies at least that the manifold will be path-connected. Likely also other things, but which exactly? 2 A precise formulation of this: let $\varepsilon>0$, $p\in M$, $v,w \in V$. Then there exists $\eta>0$, such that
$$\left\|\bigl((p \boxplus \eta v) \boxplus \eta w\bigr) \boxminus \bigl(p \boxplus (\eta v + \eta w)\bigr) \right\| < \eta\cdot \varepsilon.$$","['general-topology', 'manifolds']"
1120274,Reversed Cayley transformation for any unitary matrix,"It is well known that if $Q$ is a complex unitary matrix such that $I+Q$ is invertible (where $I$ is the identity matrix), that is, $-1$ is not an eigenvalue of $Q$, then
$$
A:=(I-Q)(I+Q)^{-1}
$$
is skew-Hermitian ($A=-A^*=-\bar{A}^T$). It is easy to prove this by factoring out the inverse from
$$
\begin{split}
A+A^*&=(I-Q)(I+Q)^{-1}+(I+Q)^{-*}(I-Q)^*\\
&=(I+Q)^{-*}[\color{blue}{(I+Q)^*(I-Q)+(I-Q)^*(I+Q)}](I+Q)^{-1}.
\end{split}\tag{1}
$$
and showing that the blue term is equal to zero. One can also use the spectral decomposition of $Q$. There is a unitary $U$ and a diagonal $D$ such that $Q=UDU^*$ with $D\bar{D}=I$. Then
$$
A=U(I-D)(I+D)^{-1}U^*.
$$
For each diagonal entry $\delta:=\alpha+i\beta$ of $D$, where $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\delta\bar\delta=\alpha^2+\beta^2=1$, the corresponding entry of $(I-D)(I+D)^{-1}$ is imaginary $(1-\delta)(1+\delta)^{-1}=-2i\alpha\beta$ and we can use the fact that a matrix is skew-Hermitian if and only if it is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix with imaginary diagonal entries. However, the approach in (1) is more elementary (and, consequently, elegant) since it does not require to know anything about spectral decompositions of unitary and skew-Hermitian matrices. Now the problem comes when one would like to drop the assumption that $I+Q$ is invertible while replacing the inverse with the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. Then
$$\tag{2}A:=(I-Q)(I+Q)^{\dagger}$$
(where $\dagger$ denotes the pseudoinverse) is still skew-Hermitian as can be shown using the spectral decomposition. Indeed,
$$
A=U(I-D)(I+D)^{\dagger}U^*,
$$
and we can again show that the diagonal entries $\delta\neq -1$ of $D$ give imaginary entries while the diagonal entries $\delta=-1$ give $0$ in $(I-D)(I+D)^{\dagger}$. However, to show this, it is not possible to use directly the same approach as in (1) since $(I+Q)^{\dagger}(I+Q)\neq I$ if $-1$ is the eigenvalue of $Q$. I was wondering whether there exists a more elementary way to show that (2) is skew-Hermitian for any unitary $Q$ (without spectral decompositions and, ideally, using only the four Penrose conditions of the pseudoinverse or some of their simple consequences). EDIT: It might be maybe useful to consider the identities $X^\dagger=(X^*X)^\dagger X^*=X^*(XX^*)^\dagger$, which give $(I+Q)^\dagger=B(I+Q)^*=(I+Q)^*B$, where $B:=(2I+Q+Q^*)^\dagger$ is Hermitian (the operations $\dagger$ and $*$ ""commute""). I don't know yet how to get the final result (e.g., the first identity gives that $A=-A^*$ iff $B=QBQ^*$).","['matrices', 'pseudoinverse', 'linear-algebra']"

1120533,Extending a continuous map between the boundary of two cells.,"I'm working in Lee's book on topological manifolds and have gotten stumped on the first question in chapter 5, the chapter on cell complexes.  The problem is: Let $D$ and $D'$ be two closed cells not necessarily of the same dimension. Show that any continuous map $f:\partial D \to \partial D'$ can be extended to a continuous map $F:D \to D'$ such that $F(Int \; D) \subseteq Int \; D'$. Given points $p \in Int \; D$ and $p' \in Int \; D'$, show that $F$ can be chosen so $F(p) = p'$. Show that if $f$ is a homeomorphism then $F$ can be chosen to be a homeomorphism. I proved the first part roughly as follows: First suppose $D$ and $D'$ are convex and each contain $0$ in their interior (in their respective ambient spaces).  Then every element other than $0$ in $D$ can be expressed uniquely in the form $\lambda q$ where $q \in \partial D$ and $\lambda\in (0,1]$ (an equivalence relation on the chords connecting $0$ to boundary points partitions $D- \{0\}$).  I then define the map $F(\lambda q) = \lambda f(q)$ which is continuous since if $\lambda_n q_n \to \lambda q$ in $D$ then $F(\lambda_n q_n) \to F(\lambda q)$.  Lastly $\lambda q \in Int \; D$ implies $\lambda <1$ and so $\lambda f(q)$ is an interior point of $D'$ since $f(q)$ is a boundary point and $D'$ is convex. Now if we suppose $D$ and $D'$ are arbitrary closed cells there are homeomorphisms $g_1: \overline{\mathbb{B}^n} \to D$ and $g_2: \overline{\mathbb{B}^m} \to D'$ (where possibly $m=n$) then we have that $g_2^{-1}\circ f \circ g_1$ is a continuous map between the boundaries of two closed balls and so by the first part can be extended to a continuous map $F:\overline{\mathbb{B}^n} \to \overline{\mathbb{B}^m}$.  The mapping $g_2 \circ F \circ g_1^{-1}$ is a continuous map that satisfies the desired claim. My issue is that parts 2 and 3 don't seem (to me at least) to follow that easily from the proof I constructed.  Maybe my proof is wrong and I'm not seeing it, but more likely I think that I'm missing the spirit in which Lee is intending for us to approach this problem.",['general-topology']

1120584,A math proof within a question about homogeneous Poisson process,"We know that a homogeneous Poisson process is a process with a constant intensity $\lambda$ . That is, for any time interval $[t, t+\Delta t]$ , $P\left \{ k \text{ events in } [t, t+\Delta t] \right \}=\frac{\exp(-\lambda \, \Delta t)(\lambda \, \Delta t)^k}{k!}$ . And therefore, event count in $[0, T]$ follows a Poisson distribution with rate $\lambda T$ . That is, $P\left \{ N(T)=k\right \}=\frac{\exp(-\lambda T)(\lambda T)^k}{k!}$ . ( $N$ is the count.) The problem is: Prove that the following simulation generates a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ on $[0, T]$ : Step 1: Sample $m$ from Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda T$ . Step 2: Sample $s_1, \cdots,s_m$ i.i.d. from uniform $[0, T]$ . That is , demonstrate that for any time interval $[t, t+\Delta t]$ in $[0,T]$ , $P\left \{ k \text{ events in } [t, t+\Delta t] \right \}=\frac{\exp(-\lambda \, \Delta t)(\lambda \, \Delta t)^k}{k!}$ . Now we look at the problem, we have Given $m$ events in $[0,T]$ , \begin{align}
& P\left \{ k \text{ events in } [t, t+\Delta t] \right \}\\
= {} & \sum^\infty_{m=k} P\left \{ k \text{ events in } [t, t+\Delta t],m \;\text{events in}\; [0,T]\right \}\\

Lemma: If $X$ is an infinite set of cardinality $h$ , $a\ne x$ for every $x\in X$ then $\{a\}\cup X$ is of cardinality $h$ too i.e. adding new element to an infinite set doesn't change cardinality. Let $h$ be an infinite cardinal number. Let $T_h=\{x:\text{x is a set of cardinality h}\}$. Suppose $T_h$ is a set. Let $a$ be any set and consider any $t\in T_h$. Let $R=t\cup \{a\}$. Using the above lemma, $R\in T_h$. So, $a\in R\subset \bigcup T_h$. As $T_h$ is a set then $\bigcup T_h$ is also a set. 
As $a$ was arbitrary set then we have, $a\in\bigcup T_h$ for every set $a$. Hence, the set $\bigcup T_h$ contains all sets which meas that the collection of all sets is a set, contradiction. If $h$ is non-zero finite cardinal number. Define $T_h$ the same way as above. Let $a$ be any set, Let $A_1=a, A_{n+1}=A_n\times a$. Consider $A=\{A_1,A_2,...,A_h\}$. So, $A\in T_k$. Hence, $a=A_1\in \bigcup T_h=K$. So K is a set containing all sets $a$ since $a$ was arbitary,contradiction. My main question is, Is there any flaws in my argument? If yes, point it out please.

1121094,Infinite sum of analytic function still analytic,"Consider $$ f_n(x)  = n e^{-n^6(x-n)^2} : \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$$
and the series $$ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_n(x). $$
Is $f$ analytic on $\mathbb R$? A function is analytic if for every compact set $K$ we can find $C$ s.t. the $k$-th derivative can be bounded as $$|f^{(k)}(x) | \leq C^{k+1} k! \quad \forall x \in K.$$
From the form of $f_n$, we know that $f^{(k)}$ will be a series of a polynomial of degree $k$ times $f_n$. However I find it hard to actually estimate $|f^{(k)}(x) |$ as required... Another try: since $f_n$ is analytic we can write $f_n(x) = \sum_k a_{k,n} x^k $ so 
$$ f(x) = \sum_n \sum_k a_{k,n} x^k.$$
Now if we switch the sums we get
$$ f(x) = \sum_k \left( \sum_n a_{k,n} \right) x^k. $$
But can we switch the sum, and it is true that $\forall k, \sum_n a_{k,n} < \infty$? Any suggestion or faster way to prove that $f$ is analytic?","['power-series', 'complex-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

1121104,"Multi-variable function is undefined at every point, then limit still may exist","The following question was posed; If a multi-variable function $f(x,y)$ was undefined at every point on a curve, then could a limit exist of a point $(x_0, y_0)$ on this curve for this function? i.e Does $\lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (x,_0, y_0)}f(x,y)$ exist? To me, the whole point of limits is to find how functions behave when the function gets arbitrarily close to points where it is not defined. So, yes, I would think that regardless if a function $f(x,y)$ is undefined at a point, then a limit still could exist. However, I can't think of an example of a function on a curve that is undefined for every point. So I'm beginning to think that if this question was stated that if $f(x,y)$ was undefined only at a certain point, then a limit could exist, which could be trivially proven by the definition. But because it says that every point on the curve is not defined, then no, the limit cannot exist for an arbitrary point $(x_0, y_0)$.

I'm trying to take the idea of an attractor from dynamical systems and impose some algebraic structure on the limiting set. Here's a tentative definition. Consider a set $S$ with a proper subset $G$ and a binary operation $\circ: S \times S\rightarrow S$, such that: $–$ $(G,\circ)$ forms a group $–$ $S$ is closed under $\circ$ $–$ if $a \in G$ or $b \in G$, then  $a\circ b \in G$ In addition, define a function $\|\cdot\|:S\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which satisfies: $–$ $\|g\|=0, \forall g \in G$ $–$ $\|a\|>0, \forall a \in S\backslash G$ $–$ $\|a\circ b\|< \|a\|$, and $\|a\circ b\|< \|b\|, \forall a,b \in S\backslash G$ The function $\|\cdot\|$ is meant to be a measure of distance from $G$. Here's an example. Consider $\mathbb{R}^2\backslash\{0\}$, with coordinates expressed in polar form. Define $\|(r,\theta)\|=|r-1|$, and $(r_1,\theta_1)\circ(r_2,\theta_2)=(1+\frac{r_\min}{2},\theta_1+\theta_2)$, where $r_\min=\min(\|(r_1,\theta_1)\|,\|(r_2,\theta_2)\|)$.

1121248,Classifying groups of order 60,"I want to solve the following problem from Dummit & Foote's Abstract Algebra text (p. 185, Exercise 14): This exercise classifies the groups of order $60$ (there are thirteen isomorphism types). Let $G$ be a group of order 60, let $P$ be a Sylow 5-subgroup of $G$ and let $Q$ be a Sylow 3-subgroup of $G$. (a) Prove that if $P$ is not normal in $G$ then $G \cong A_5$. [See Section 4.5.] (b) Prove that if $P \trianglelefteq G$ but $Q$ is not normal in $G$ then $G \cong A_4 \times Z_5$. [Show in this case that $P \leq Z(G)$,$G/P \cong A_4$, a Sylow 2-subgroup $T$ of $G$ is normal and $TQ \cong A_4$.] (c) Prove that if both $P$ and $Q$ are normal in $G$ then $G \cong Z_{15} \rtimes T$ where $T \cong Z_4$ or $Z_2 \times Z_2$. Show in this case that there are six isomorphism types when $T$ is cyclic (one abelian) and there are five isomorphism types when $T$ is the Klein 4-group (one abelian). [Use the same ideas as in the classifications of groups of orders 30 and 20.] My attempt: (a) If $n_5(G)>1$ then $G$ is simple by Proposition 21 of Section 4. Proposition 23 of the same section gives $G \cong A_5$. (b) If $P \trianglelefteq G$ but $Q \not \trianglelefteq G$, Sylow's Theorem part (iii) gives $n_3(G) \geq 4$. Let $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3,Q_4$ be four distinct Sylow 3-subgroups. The groups $PQ_i$ are all cyclic and intersect (pairwise) at $P$ (since they have $2$ elements of order $3$). Thus $C_G(P)$ contains at least $15+10+10+10=45$ elements. Lagrange's Theorem gives $|C_G(P)|=60$ and consequently $Z(G) \geq P$. The quotient $G/P$ is of order $12=2^2 \cdot 3$. We know that for groups of order 12 either $n_2=1$ or $n_3=1$. Suppose by way of contradiction that $n_3=1$. As the group $Q_1P/P$ is a Sylow 3-subgroup it is normal. The Fourth Isomorphism Theorem gives that $Q_1P \trianglelefteq G$. However, let $g$ be an element of $G$ conjugating $Q_1$ to $Q_2$ (which exists by Sylow's Theorem part (ii)). We have $gQ_1Pg^{-1}=gQ_1g^{-1}gPg^{-1}=Q_2P \neq Q_1P$. Thus $n_3 \neq 1$ and consequently $n_2=1$. The discussion on pages 182-183 gives $G/P \cong A_4$. The Fourth Isomorphism Theorem applied again gives that a Sylow 2-subgroup of $G$, $T$ is normal. Thus $TQ \leq G$ is a subgroup of order $12$. If $Q \trianglelefteq TQ$ then since $Q$ is normalised by $TQ$ as well as the elements of the central subgroup $P$, we find that $Q \trianglelefteq G$ which is a contradiction. Thus $n_3(TQ) \neq 1$ and consequently $TQ \cong A_4$. Now, since $P \trianglelefteq G$ and $P \cap TQ=1$, we have that $G \cong P \rtimes_\varphi TQ \cong Z_5 \rtimes_\varphi A_4$ for some homomorphism $\varphi$. Since $A_4$ is generated by the 3-cycles, and since $\text{Aut}(Z_5) \cong Z_4$ has no elements of order 3, we find that $\varphi$ is trivial. Hence $G \cong Z_5 \times A_4$ in that case. (c) If $P,Q \trianglelefteq G$, then $PQ \trianglelefteq G$ is a normal subgroup, with complement $T$, a Sylow 2-subgroup of $G$. $PQ$ is a group of order $15$, so it must be isomorphic to $Z_{5} \times Z_3=\langle a \rangle \times \langle b \rangle$, while $T$ has two possible isomorphism types: $Z_4$ and $Z_2 \times Z_2$. The semidirect product criterion gives $G \cong (Z_{5} \times Z_3) \rtimes_\varphi T$ for some homomorphism $\varphi:T \to \text{Aut}(Z_{5} \times Z_3) \cong Z_4 \times Z_2$. We begin with the case where $T =\langle x \rangle \cong Z_4$ is cyclic. $\varphi$ is then determined by $\varphi(x)$ which can have orders $1,2$ or $4$. If $|\varphi(x)|=1$ we get the direct product $Z_{15} \times Z_4$.  If $|\varphi(x)|=2$, since we have 3 elements of order 2 in $\text{Aut}(PQ)$ as listed on page 182. If $\varphi(x)$ sends $a \mapsto a$ and $b \mapsto b^{-1}$ we get the following presentation \begin{equation}
G_1=\langle a,b,x| a^5=b^3=x^4=1|bab^{-1}=a,xax^{-1}=a,xbx^{-1}=b^{-1} \rangle
\end{equation} which can be factored as $G_1 \cong \langle a \rangle \times \langle b,x \rangle$. Since $\langle b,x \rangle$ is a group of order $12$ which has $n_3=1$, it is isomorphic to the one of example 2 on page 178. This is pretty much where I get stuck... I can get presentations for the other semidirect products, but I can't see which ones are isomorphic to each other. I am aware of the solution here , yet I think it uses too many unnatural lemmas.

Describing a single Schubert variety is no problem as its maximal cell is isomorphic to an affine space $\mathbb{A^r}$ -- explicitly written down as matrices with many entries set to 0 or 1, and the rest free. And there's the corresponding description for opposite Schuberts. For describing the intersection $X^\circ_\lambda \cap \Omega^\circ_\mu$, is there a simple way to 'combine' the forward- and opposite-Schubert descriptions? For example, in $G(2,5)$, $$\begin{pmatrix}
* &* & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ * & * & 0 & * & 1

Ideally I'd like to have exactly $\dim(X^\circ_\lambda \cap \Omega^\circ_\mu)$ coordinates, as in this example.

The idea is like this: consider $T = \{ (x,y,z) \mid x + y + z = 1, x, y, z \geq 0 \}$. This is a triangle in $\mathbb R^3$. Take a point $\overline x \in T$, and consider $\lambda_x M \overline x \in T$, for some $\lambda_x \in \mathbb R$. This is a vector which is equal to some $y \in T$. In particular, $\lambda_x M$ is a homeomorphism $T \to T$. Hence it has a fixed point $\overline x$. So $\lambda_x M \overline x =\overline x \implies M \overline x = \frac{1}{\lambda_x} \overline x$. So $\overline x$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\frac{1}{\lambda _x}$, which is certainly positive.

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f( \bar{x} )\delta(x-\bar{x}) \mathrm{d}\bar{x}=f(x)

because I can say that the delta function fires whenever $x=\bar{x}$ and picks up the value of $f(x)$ at that point and when I integrate over all values of x, I get my function f(x) back. In other words it is like building the function $f(x)$ from thin sticks, which has the same hight as the value of the function.

1121738,How do I find the error of nth iteration in Newton's Raphson's method without knowing the exact root,"In our calculus class, we were introduced to the numerical approximation of root by Newton Raphson method. The question was to calculate the root of a function up to nth decimal places. Assuming that the function is nice and our initial value does lead to convergence. Our teacher terminated the algorithm when the two successive iterations had the same first n digits and told us that the the approximation was correct up to the nth digit! I feel that the termination step is valid if $f(x_n)$ and $f(x_{n+1})$ has different signs but my teacher disagrees. How do I sort this out??

1121777,Logic behind a proof in Topological Vector Spaces,"I found the following result at the beginning of some notes on topological vector spaces (TVS). This is a quite fundamental result, that apparently is considered the corresponding version of the triangle inequality in TVS. Here there is the result with two proofs. Theorem: Let $X$ be a TVS. Then, for every $W \in \mathcal{N}_0$ there exists a $U \in \mathcal{N}_{0}^\text{sym}$ such that $U+U \subset W$. Proof 1: For any neighborhood $W \in \mathcal{N}_o$, there are neighborhoods $U_1, U_2$ of $0$ such that $U_1 + U_2 \subseteq W$. The result follows by setting $U = U_1 \cap U_2 \cap (-U_1) \cap (-U_2)$. Proof 2: Since $0+0 = 0$ and addition is continuous, there exist neighborhoods $U_1, U_2 \in \mathcal{N}_0$ such that $U_1 + U_2 \subseteq W$. The result follows by setting $U = U_1 \cap U_2 \cap (-U_1) \cap (-U_2)$, by noting that $U$ is symmetric. Here $\mathcal{N}_{0}$ denotes the neighborhood of $0$, and $\mathcal{N}_{0}^\text{sym}$ the symmetric neighborhood of $0$. Now, in both cases I am not sure about the logic behind them. In particular, here there are my doubts: 1) In proof 1 how do we come up with the fact that there are neighborhoods $U_1, U_2$ of $0$ – and not of something else! – such that $U_1 + U_2 \subseteq W$? 2) In proof 2 why do we focus on $0 + 0=0$? Is it because if we would have focused on – let's say– $2 + (-2) = 0$, we would have got still a neighborhood of $0$ by translation invariance, i.e. $\mathcal{N}_0 +2$? As you could notice, both questions are fairly similar and are concerned, in my opinion, with the inner logic of TVS, that completely baffles me right now.

1121854,"Check my answer - complex analysis, using residue and rouche's theorem","I was asked the following questions and I am unsure of my solutions, any advice would be appreciated, maybe there is a better way of doing this. Question : We are given $f(z)=2z-\sinh (z)$ defined on the circle $|z|=1$. Our goal is to calculate $\int_{|z|=1}\frac{1}{f(z)}dz$ What I did : The first thing we need to take care of is finding how many roots does $f(z)$ have in the given domain. If we can prove that $|2z-f(z)| \leq |2z|$ in the circle then from Rouche's theorem they have the same number of roots, and we know that $2z$ has a root only at $z=0$. Here I also used a known inequality: $|\sinh(z)| \leq |z| \cosh (|z|)$: $|2z-f(z)|=|\sinh(z)|\leq |z|\cosh(|z|=\cosh(1)=\frac{e+e^{-1}}{2}<2=|2z|$ in the circle. We proved the inequality, so from rouche's theorem, $f(z)$ has only $1$ root in the circle, and we can see that $f(0)=0$ is the only root, and $f'(0) \neq 0$ so the ""rank"" of the root is $1$. We can use taylor series to separate $f$ to a function with roots multiplied by a function without roots (in the circle ofcourse): $$f(z)=2z-\sinh(z)=2z-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}=z(2-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{2n}}{(2n+1)!})=z(1-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{2n}}{(2n+1)!})$$ Let $\psi(z)=1-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{2n}}{(2n+1)!}$, so overall we have $f(z)=z\psi(z)$ Notice that $\psi(0)=1$ (that's the residue) and that $\psi$ has no roots in $|z|=1$ (otherwise, $f(z)$ would have had more roots, and we already showed that $0$ is its only root). So to calculate the integral: $$\int_{|z|=1} \frac{1}{f(z)}dz=\int_{|z|=1} \frac{1}{z}\frac{1}{\psi(z)}dz=\frac{2i\pi}{\psi(0)}=2i\pi$$ from residue theorem.
