1816631,Examples of the primitive decomposition of a form,"Let $(X,\omega)$ be a Kahler manifold of dimension $n$, let $L = \omega \wedge -$ and let $\Lambda$ denote its adjoint. There is a unique ''primitive decomposition'' of a $k$-form $u$ which looks like
$$
u = \sum_{r \geq \max(k-n,0)} L^r u_r
$$
for some $(k-2r)$-forms $u_r$ such that $\Lambda u = 0$. This is proved in many places, but there are not many examples or calculations that I've seen! For example, if I write down some form $\eta$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$ (which is a Kahler manifold when equipped with the Kahler form $\omega = \frac{i}{2} \sum_{j=1}^n dz_j \wedge d\overline{z}_j$), then how would I find the primitive decomposition of $\eta$? Is there some algorithmic way, in general, to calculate the primitive decomposition of a form?","['kahler-manifolds', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

1816761,Interesting Series with Zeta Function,"I was trying to find another representation for the value of an integral when I found the following series:

1816774,Moments of positive Carleson measure,"A result of Widom from the 60's shows that a measure $\mu$ on the unit disc $\mathbb D$ concentrated on $(-1,1)$ is a Carleson measure if and only if
$$
\int_{(-1,1)} t^k\,d\mu(t) = O(1/k)\quad\text{ as }k\to +\infty.

My question is, if we apply a functional in the dual space of $\ell^p$ to $x$: $$f(x)= f \left(\sum^\infty_{i=1}{\alpha_i}{e_i}\right)$$ My text then motivates the next step by saying ""since $f$ is linear and bounded"", we get: $$f(x)= \sum^\infty_{i=1}{\alpha_i}{f(e_i)}$$ I am unsure whether boundedness really plays a role here with this step. A non-rigorous way of thinking about the above step would be: $$f(x)= f \left({\alpha_1}{e_1}+{\alpha_2}{e_2}+{\alpha_3}{e_3}+...\right)\implies$$ $$f(x)= f ({\alpha_1}{e_1})+f({\alpha_2}{e_2})+f({\alpha_3}{e_3})+...\implies$$ $$f(x)= {\alpha_1}f ({e_1})+{\alpha_2}f({\alpha_2}{e_2})+{\alpha_3}f({e_3})+... = \sum^\infty_{i=1}{\alpha_i}{f(e_i)}$$ All following from the linearity of $f\in \ell^{p'} $.

1817063,Topology and Borel sets of extended real line,"Let $\mathcal{B}_{X}$ denote the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $X$.
I'm reading a book on real analysis by Folland and he defines
$$\mathcal{B}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}} = \{ E \mid E \cap \mathbb{R} \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}} \},$$
where $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is the extended real line. He says this agrees with the usual definition of Borel sets if we make $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ into a metric space with metric
$$d(x, y) = |\arctan x - \arctan y|.$$
I don't like this approach because it's tricky, unintuitive and uses a metric when we only need a topology (if I'm not mistaken). I want to define a topology $\mathcal{T}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}}$ on $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ in such a way that $\mathcal{B}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}} = \sigma(\mathcal{T}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}})$, that is, $\mathcal{B}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}}$ is generated by $\mathcal{T}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}}$; if $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous w.r.t. standard topology of $\mathbb{R}$ and we extend range of $f$ to $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ then extended function $\overline{f}$ is continuous w.r.t. $\mathcal{T}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}}$. I have two questions: Is what I'm doing correct? Is this the standard way to handle $\pm\infty$? Let $X$ be a chain. Then the order topology on $X$ is generated by basis consisting of sets of the following types: $(a; b)$, $[x_{\min}; b)$ (provided that $x_{\min}$ exists), $(a; x_{\max}]$ (provided that $x_{\max}$ exists). Let $\mathcal{T}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}}$ be the order topology of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. Choose any $U \in \mathcal{T}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}}$ and write $U \cap \mathbb{R}$ as
$$U \cap \mathbb{R} = \bigcup_{x \in U}(B_x \cap \mathbb{R}),$$
where $B_x \subset U$ is a basis element containing $x$. This set is open in standard topology since each $B_x \cap \mathbb{R}$ is open. Thus $U \cap \mathbb{R} \in  \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$ and $U \in \mathcal{B}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}}$. Since $U$ was arbitrary $\mathcal{B}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}} \supset \sigma(\mathcal{T}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}})$ It's easy to show that $\mathcal{B}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}} = \sigma(\mathcal{E})$, where
$$\mathcal{E} = \{ (a; \infty] \mid a \in \mathbb{R} \}.$$
Now (1) follows from
$$\sigma(\mathcal{T}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}}) \supset \sigma(\mathcal{E}) = \mathcal{B}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}}.$$ To prove (2), suppose $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous w.r.t. standard topology and let $U \in \mathcal{T}_{\overline{\mathbb{R}}}$. Then $\overline{f}\,^{-1}(U) = f^{-1}(U \cap \mathbb{R})$ is open since $U \cap \mathbb{R}$ is open in standard topology.","['general-topology', 'infinity', 'measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"

1817203,What makes a geometric construction more or less stable?,"As anyone who's actually done geometric construction of n-gons knows, not all construction methods are made equal. Some are very stable (the shape you get is always close to ideal even if you're not absolutely precise, like the construction of a square or octagon), some are very unstable (the notorious construction of the regular 17-gon) and will fail to even produce the correct number of sides if you're not incredibly precise. What's more, different constructions for the same polygon often have differing stability. What exactly makes a construction more or less stable? The number of steps is obviously important, but it seems more complicated than that. For example, it's fairly easy to construct even large power-of-two-gons (16-gon, 32-gon, etc), accurately because all you need to do is bisect. The pentagon though has as few as nine steps to mark all vertices (maybe less, that's the shortest construction I know), but is fairly difficult to construct accurately (they often come out visibly irregular).

When I learned about category theory, I was told that what this means in a precise sense is that the identity functor is naturally isomorphic to the double dual functor. Now I know exactly what this means, I can intuitively see that a natural isomorphism between two functors means that they 'do the same' in a very strict sense. However, I do not understand intuitively why this natural isomorphism makes precise the notion of the isomorphism $V \cong V^*$ not being dependent of a choice of basis of $V$.

Then (a) $(u \ast \varphi)(x)$ is continuous with respect to $u \in \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$, with respect to $\varphi \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and with respect to $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (b) $u \ast \varphi$ is a tempered distribution. (c) If $\psi \in \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, we have
\begin{align*} 
\langle \psi, u \ast \varphi \rangle = u \left ( \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \psi(x) (\tau_x \widetilde{\varphi})(\cdot) dx \right )
\end{align*}
and extend this identity to case $\psi \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. HINT: To prove (b), check that $|(u \ast \varphi)(x)| \leq C(1+|x|^2)^N$
by proving an estimate $q_N(\tau_x \varphi) \leq 2^N(1+|x|^2)^N q_N(\varphi)$. Note that for me there are these definitions. Let $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ the topological dual space of $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. 
We have that the mapping $u \in \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n) \longmapsto v=u_{|\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)} \in \mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is linear and one-to-one  because convergence in $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ implies convergence in $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and $u_{|\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)} \in \mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ determines uniquely $u \in \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Then a distribution $v \in \mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the restriction of an element $u \in \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ if and only if there exist $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and a constant $C_N>0$ such that \begin{align*} 
|u(\varphi)| \leq C_N q_N(\varphi)=C_N \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n; |\alpha| \leq N} (1+|x|^2)^N |D^\alpha \varphi(x)| , \forall  \varphi \in \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)

The elements of $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ or their restriction to  $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ are called tempered distributions. To prove (a).

With emphasis on freshman : relatively simple explanations would be appreciated over highly abstract ones as I'm still only halfway through my ""introduction to analysis"" course. And in contrast - while we're at it - why is deriving the sine function from the integral definition of the arcsine $(*)$ $$\arcsin(x) =\int_0^x \! \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t^2}} \, \mathrm{d}t \; \; (*)$$ considered to be more rigorous? In order for somebody to know this definition, it would seem to me that you'd have to prove that this is the integral of the arcsine function. And in order to prove this property, you'd have to have a clear definition of an arcsine function that doesn't rely on integrals, which brings you back to the sine function (defining the arcsine as the inverse of a sine function). So you'd end up using property $(*)$ to create a rigorous definition for trigonometric functions even though this property was derived non-rigorously, thus inviting the question ""why wasn't the definition using arc length sufficient if the rigorous approach appears to invoke non-rigorous ideas itself?"" ?

$$\cos(20^\circ)\cos(30^\circ)\cos(40^\circ)=\cos^2(10^\circ)\cos(50^\circ)$$
stinks of sweat and brute force: If $\cos(10^\circ)=x$ then using $\cos(a+b) = \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b$ and $\cos^2 + \sin^2 = 1$ you get
$$
\cos(20^\circ) = 2x^2-1\\
\cos(30^\circ) = 4x^3-3x \\
\cos(40^\circ) = 8x^4-8x^2+1\\
\cos(80^\circ) = 128x^8-256x^6+160x^4-32x^2+1
$$
Then 
$$
\sin(10^\circ) = 128x^8-256x^6+160x^4-32x^2+1
$$
and using $\sin (a+b) = \sin(a) \cos(b) + \cos a \sin b$ and $\sin(30^\circ)=\frac12$ you get
$$
\sin(20^\circ)= 256x^9 -512x^7+320x^5-64x^3+2x \\
\cos(50^\circ)=(2x^2-1)(4x^x-3x) - \frac12(256x^9 -512x^7+320x^5-64x^3+2x)\\
\cos(50^\circ) = -128x^9+256x^7-152x^5+22x^3+2x
$$
Now that we have all the needed values of cosines, we have to prove that
$$
(2x^2-1)(4x^x-3x)(8x^4-8x^2+1)=x^2(-128x^9+256x^7-152x^5+22x^3+2x)\\

$$
The tool we have is that $\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ so
$$x^3=\frac{\sqrt{3}/2+3x}{4}
$$
We now have to use that replace the highest power of $x$ by 2 powers lower; for example, using 
$$x^{11} = \frac{3x^9}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}x^8$$
I had to do this replacement trick thirteen times (seven on the right side and six on the left) before I came to

Proposition B If $\sF$ is finitely presented, then $\sHom_\sO(\sF,\sG)_x \to \operatorname{Hom}_{\sO_x}(\sF_x,\sG_x)$ is an isomorphism for all $x\in X$. I have a minor confusion about the proof of Proposition A. The proof is standard and goes basically as follows: The question is local, so we may assume that we have an exact sequence $\mathscr O^p \to \mathscr O^q \to \mathscr F \to 0$.  Applying $\sHom_\sO(-,\sG)$ yields an exact sequence \begin{equation}\label{confused}\tag{$\star$} 0 \to \sHom_\sO(\sF,\sG) \to \sHom_\sO(\sO^q, \sG) \to \sHom_\sO(\sO^p, \sG)\end{equation} which may be identified with $0 \to \sHom_\sO(\sF,\sG) \to \sG^q \to \sG^p$. Since the category of coherent sheaves is closed under direct sums and kernels, $\sHom_\sO(\sF,\sG)$ must be coherent. My confusion is that both FAC (Paragraph 14, Proposition 6) and EGA I (Chapter 0, Corollary 5.3.7) cite Proposition B in justifying the exactness of $\eqref{confused}$, and I don't see why this is necessary or relevant.","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1817833,"Are there general methods that can be applied when using the Borel-Cantelli Lemma, to get a statement about a sequence of random variables?

Closed 7 years ago . I hope the title in itself is clear, if not allow me to give an example. In Class my Professor did the following: Given a sequence $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of non-negative i.i.d. RV $X_n \sim X$ with $E(X)< \infty$ then $\frac{X_n}{n} \to 0 $ almost surely To prove this, it is easy to show that $\sum P (X_n/n > \epsilon) < \infty$ and thus conclude by Borel-Cantelli Lemma that $$P ( \limsup \lbrace X_n/n > \epsilon \rbrace ) =0 \iff P ( \lim \inf \lbrace X_n /n \leq \epsilon \rbrace )=1 $$
But one indeed looks for the answer that $\exists \Lambda \subset \Omega$ with $P( \Lambda)=1$ and for all realizations $\omega \in \Lambda$ we have that $X_n(\omega)/n \to 0$. In the question Is it correct to say that ($\color{red}{(} \limsup |W_k|/k\color{red}{)} \le 1) \supseteq \limsup \color{red}{(}|W_k|/k \le 1\color{red}{)}$? Daniel Fischer gives an answer on how to get an inclusion of the form $\liminf \lbrace ... \rbrace \subset \lbrace \limsup ... \rbrace$. I do believe that he makes use of the (complementary) statement which says that for $\epsilon >0$ $$ \lbrace \lim \sup | X_n - X| > \epsilon \rbrace \subset \lim \sup \lbrace | X_n -X | \geq \epsilon \rbrace \subset \lbrace \lim \sup |X_n - X | \geq \epsilon \rbrace \tag{*} $$

The Definition gives $$\limsup \lbrace X_n/n > \epsilon \rbrace = \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty \bigcup_{k=n} A_k \text{ where } A_k:= \lbrace X_k/k > \epsilon \rbrace $$ so intuitively I would say that $\epsilon=\epsilon(k)$ varies as $k$ increases. 3) Are there any general techniques you'd recommend to make a statement about the limit of a sequence of random variables using Borel-Cantelli Lemmas?","['borel-cantelli-lemmas', 'probability-theory', 'convergence-divergence', 'random-variables']"

Thus I have written $ 5 = 3a + 2b$ and the number $7 = 4a+3b$ I have selected both numerator and denominator to be consecutive numbers, and surprisingly this gives better approximations to $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ The question now is: how to prove that, in fact, this  algebraic fraction, whit the described iteration above, converges to the desired value?","['approximation-theory', 'real-analysis', 'trigonometry', 'limits']"

1818104,"Given distances (shortest paths) between four cities, how to show that they cannot be in the same plane?","In the example below we are given distances between four cities. The author of the book says that these distances ""suffice to prove that the world is not flat"". Do I understand this correctly that this just means: Checking that we cannot place four points on plane with these distances? Or am I supposed to interpret this claim differently? How can this be shown? I.e., how can I use the distances below to show that it is not possible to find the points on the plane with these distances? If I understand the problem correctly, I am supposed to find some property which is fulfilled for distance between the vertices of any quadrilateral in a plane. And then show that the given distances do not fulfill this property. The following excerpt is taken from Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell by Zee, page 66 The logic of differential geometry Differential geometry, as developed by Gauss and Riemann, tells us that given the metric, we can calculate the curvature. The logic goes as follows. The metric tells you the distance between two nearby points. Integrating, you can obtain the distance along any curve joining two points, not necessarily nearby. Find the curve with the shortest distance. By definition, this curve is the ""straight line"" between these two points. Once you know how to find the ""straight line"" between any two points, you can test all of Euclid’s theorems to see whether our space is flat. For example, as described in the prologue, the mite geometers could now draw a small circle around any point, measure its circumference, and see if it is equal to $2\pi$ times the radius. (See appendix 1.) Thus, the metric can tell us about curvature. Take an everyday example: given an airline table of distances, you can deduce that the world is curved without ever going outside. If I tell you the three distances between Paris, Berlin, and Barcelona, you can draw a triangle on a flat piece of paper with the three cities at the vertices. But now if I also give you the distances between Rome and each of these three cities, you would find that you can’t extend the triangle to a planar quadrangle (figure 1). So the distances between four points suffice to prove that the world is not flat. But the metric tells you the distances between an infinite number of points. I have looked up distances between these four cities on WolframAlpha: Barcelona - Berlin: 1498 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+barcelona+berlin Bacelona - Paris: 829.2 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+barcelona+paris Barcelona - Rome: 861.8 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+rome+barcelona Berlin - Paris: 878.7 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+berlin+paris Berlin - Rome: 1184 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+berlin+rome Paris - Rome: 1109 km http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+paris+rome $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}

Statement: Let $(X_n)_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of non-negative random variables that are identically distributed $X_n \sim X \geq 0 $ with $E(X)< \infty$, show that $ X_n/n \to 0$ almost surely Proof: Since $X_n \sim X$ for some non negative random variables we can easily compute that for $\epsilon >0$ we have $$ \infty>E(X/\epsilon) = \int_0^\infty P(X/ \epsilon > t) dt = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \int_{n-1}^n P(X/ \epsilon > t ) dt \geq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(X/ \epsilon >n) $$
Thanks to the Borel-Cantelli Lemma we obtain that $$ P ( \limsup_{n \to \infty} \lbrace X_n/n > \epsilon \rbrace ) = 0 \iff P ( \liminf_{n \to \infty} \lbrace X_n/n \leq \epsilon \rbrace) = 1 $$ Question: Does the $\epsilon$ in the above depend on $k$? I think it does and I would argue as follows $$P( \liminf_{n \to \infty} \lbrace X_n/n \leq \epsilon \rbrace )= P  \left( \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \bigcap_{k=n}  \lbrace X_k/k \leq \epsilon (k) \rbrace \right) $$
Now using the chain of inclusions that state that we have for $\epsilon >0$  $$ \lbrace \limsup |X_n-X| < \epsilon \rbrace \subset \liminf \lbrace |X_n-X| < \epsilon \rbrace \subset \lbrace \limsup |X_n-X| \leq \epsilon \rbrace $$
We conclude that $$ P ( \lbrace \limsup_{n \to \infty } X_n/ n \leq \epsilon(k) \rbrace)=1 $$
Where I choose the same $k \in \mathbb{N}$ as above, and then choose $k^*$ large enough such that $\epsilon(k) \leq \frac{1}{k^*}$, define the set $$ \Lambda_{k^*}:= \lbrace \limsup_{n \to \infty} X_n/n \leq 1/k^* \rbrace \implies P(\Lambda_{k^*})=1$$
and also we obtain that $\Lambda:=\bigcap_{j \geq k^*} \Lambda_{k^*}$ is still an almost sure event, i.e. $P(\Lambda)=1$ but for all realizations $\omega \in \Lambda$ we have $\limsup_{n \to \infty} X_n( \omega)/n \leq 0  \implies X_n( \omega)/n \to 0$ for all $\omega \in \Lambda$ that is$X_n/n \to 0$ almost surely $\Box$ Are my arguments given above correct and more importantly complete?

1818365,Jacobian of a matrix-valued function,"I am fairly sure the very reason my problem arises in the first place is that I am going about it wrong, or have gotten some basic concept wrong, so any answer to point out my misunderstanding would be most welcome. I think what I need amounts to the following: I want to get the 'Jacobian matrix' of a function $P:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{p\times q}$. As a simple example, if $U_1,\dots,U_n$ are known $\mathbb{R}^{p\times q}$ matrices, $P$ could be something such as: $$P(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i=1}^nw_iU_i$$ Where $\mathbf{w} = (w_1,\dots,w_n)$. The partial derivative of $P$ with regard to any coordinate of input $\mathbf{w}$ is straightforward enough, but my problem is that I would like to have a whole Jacobian matrix to perform further computation. Except a 'three-dimensional' $\mathbb{R}^{(p\times q) \times n}$ Jacobian seems wrong, and I would have no idea how to do anything with it anyway (e.g. a simple dot product with any regular, two-dimensional matrix). I had the intuition that the solution somehow relied on considering the Jacobian of $P$ as having $pq$ lines, but this would mean considering vectorized $(U_i)$'s. In my case, I don't see how this would work, as my $L$ function (see below) very much makes use of the $p\times q$ structure of its inputs. At the very least, I feel like it would then require to properly introduce the $vec$ transform and take it into account when computing the derivatives? Context: I have a function, $\mathcal{E}: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, whose gradient I want to compute. $\mathcal{E}$ itself can be written as: $$\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{w}) = L(P(\mathbf{w}), X)$$ Where $X\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times q}$ is a known constant matrix, $L:\left(\mathbb{R}^{p\times q},\mathbb{R}^{p\times q}\right)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, and $P:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{p\times q}$ as above. Now, if $P$ was a $\mathbb{R}^p$-valued function and $X\in\mathbb{R}^p$ instead, I would simply use the chain rule to get my gradient, i.e.: $$\nabla\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{w}) = \left[\partial P(\mathbf{w})\right]^T\nabla L(P(\mathbf{w}),X)$$ In which case the (transposed) Jacobian matrix in the first term would be in $\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$, the second term in $\mathbb{R}^p$, and my gradient in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as expected. But since $P$ is matrix-valued here, I don't know how to proceed. Lastly, just in case this can help figuring out how I got there: in my case, I can think of $\mathbf{w}$ as a vector of weights, of the $(U_i)$ and $X$ as images and of $L$ as a loss function between my weighted transformation of $(U_i)$'s and a reference image $X$. $p$ would then be the number of pixels, and $q$ would be, say, $3$ if I am using RGB encoding - $L$ thus makes use of the $p\times q$ structure of its inputs, hence my reluctance to simply consider vectorized $(U_i)$.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'derivatives']"
1818376,Calculate the integral $\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dy}{(1+y^2)(1+[x-y]^2)}$,"Calculate the integral for $x\in\mathbb{R}$
  $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dy}{(1+y^2)(1+[x-y]^2)}$$where $[\ ]$ is the floor function. By using the fitting tool of MATLAB I'm almost certain that the answer is
$$\frac{2\pi}{(x-0.5)^2+4}$$compared with the result of an easier integral
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{dy}{(1+y^2)(1+(x-y)^2)}=\frac{2\pi}{x^2+4}$$
Noting that the wanting integral is $f(x)*f([x])$ if $f(x)=1/(1+x^2)$, I tried to calculate $\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\mathcal{F}(f(x))\cdot\mathcal{F}(f([x])))$ by convolution theorem. But things didn't get any simpler.","['real-analysis', 'calculus', 'analysis']"

$$\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sqrt{\frac{\sin(\tan(x))}{\tan(x)}\tan(x)}}{\sqrt{\frac{\tan(\sin(x))}{\sin(x)}\sin(x)}}=\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sqrt{\tan(x)}}{\sqrt{\sin(x)}}=\lim_{x\to 0} \sqrt{\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)\sin(x)}}=\lim_{x\to 0} \sqrt{\frac{1}{\cos(x)}}=1$$ Can I do that?

1818398,Analytic continuation definition,"I've seen that analytic continuation is defined as: Let $f_1,f_2$ be analytic functions on $D_1,D_2$, respectively. If $D_1\cap D_2\neq \emptyset$ and $f_1(z)=f_2(z)$ for all $z\in D_1\cap D_2$, then $f_2$ is analytic continuation for $f_1$ to $D_2$ and vice versa. How come there are no restrictions for $D_1\cap D_2$? If we take $f_1(x)=0$ and $f_2(x)=x$ and $D_1=(-1,0]$ and $D_2=[0,1)$, then the previous definition would suggest that $f_2$ is analytic continuation for $f_1$ to $D_2$, which is not true. Shouldn't there be restriction for $D_1\cap D_2$ be an open set? Is the previous definition incorrect or am I simply missing something?

1818429,Exercise 2.1.1 from Einsiedler and Ward,"I am studying Ergodic Theory for the first time, and am using the book ""Ergodic Theory with a view towards Number Theory"" by Einsiedler and Ward. I got stuck at the very first exercise problem, numbered 2.1.1. which says: Show that the spaces $(\mathbb T,B_{\mathbb T},m_{\mathbb T})$ and $(\mathbb T^2, B_{\mathbb T^2},m_{\mathbb T^2})$ are isomorphic as measure spaces, where $\mathbb T=\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ and $m_{\mathbb T}$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb T$. The book does not define isomorphic measure spaces, but I think it means I hae to give a bijective map $f:(\mathbb T^2, B_{\mathbb T^2},m_{\mathbb T^2})\to (\mathbb T,B_{\mathbb T},m_{\mathbb T})$ so that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are measurable. Notice, $B_{\mathbb T}$ is the Borel $\sigma-$algebra on $\mathbb T$. I also am not sure I understand what $\mathbb T^2$ means. Does it mean $\mathbb T\times \mathbb T$? That is $\{(x+\mathbb Z,y+\mathbb Z):x,y\in[0,1)\}$? So I have two real numbers, $x$ and $y$, and I want to map them bijectively to a new number in $[0,1)$. Can I do that? Should this at all be my approach? Update I read from Bogachev that two measure spaces $(X,A,\mu)$ and $Y,B,\nu)$ are isomorphic iff there exists a bijective map $\phi:X\to Y$ so that $\phi$ and $\phi^{-1}$ are measurable and there exist $X'\subset X$, $Y'\subset Y$ and $\nu=\mu\circ \phi^{-1}$. Here I take $X=[0,1), Y=[0,1)^2$ and $X'=[0,1)\cap \mathbb Q^c$, $Y'=([0,1)\cap\mathbb Q^c)^2$ then each has Lebesgue measure $1$. I chose irrationals because they have unique representation. I define $\phi:X'\to Y'$ as $\phi(0.a_1a_2a_3a_4...)=(0.a_1a_3a_5...,0.a_2a_4a_6...)$ basically taking the odd and even parts in the decimal expansion. Then I saw that $\phi$ is bijective (injectivity follows due to unique representation in base 10, for irrationals). I am not sure but I think this map is measurable and its inverse also is measurable. But I don't think the last property is true i.e. the value of the measures being same are not true in general. Can you please help me to find a map, then, probably using mine or otherwise?","['ergodic-theory', 'measure-theory', 'analysis']"
