3576945,Definition of a Frenet curve,"Recently I followed a course in Differential Geometry. The book we use is Differential Geometry: Curves - Surfaces - Manifolds by Wolfgang Kühnel. My question is about the definition of a Frenet curve. 2.4. Definition (Frenet curve). Let $c(s)$ be a regular curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is parametrized by arc length and $n$ -times continuously differentiable. Then $c$ is called a Frenet curve , if at every point the vectors $c',c'',\dots,c^{(n-1)}$ are linearly independent. The Frenet $n$ -frame $e_1,e_2,\dots,e_n$ is then uniquely determined by the following conditions: (i) $e_1,\dots,e_n$ are orthonormal and positively oriented. (ii) For every $k=1,\dots,n-1$ one has $\text{Span}(e_1,\dots,e_k)=\text{Span}(c',\dots,c^{(k)})$ . (iii) $\langle c^{(k)},e_k\rangle>0$ for $k=1,\dots,n-1$ . My thought: In this definition, I think (i) and (ii) are enough to uniquely determined $e_1,\dots,e_n$ . Indeed, one obtains $e_1,\dots,e_{n-1}$ from $c',\dots,c^{(n-1)}$ by means of the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure, and the missing $e_n$ is then uniquely determined by condition (i). Why condition (iii) is necessary? Any help would be appreciated.","['linear-algebra', 'differential-geometry']"

3577075,"Bayes estimate for loss function $\ell(t,\alpha)=\frac{1}{\alpha^2}(t-\alpha^2)^2$?","I am given the following info for $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ : $$X\sim f(X|\alpha)=\alpha X^{-(\alpha+1)}I(X>1).$$ Propose a convenient family of priors and find the Bayes estimate for the loss function $\ell(t,\alpha)=\frac{1}{\alpha^2}(t-\alpha^2)^2$ . The joint distribution is of the form $$f(\underline{X}|\alpha)=\alpha^n\prod_{i=1}^{n}X_i^{-(\alpha+1)}I(X_i>1)=\alpha^n e^{-(\alpha+1)\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log(X_i)}I(X_{(1)}>1).$$ Then, $\text{Gamma}(a,b)$ seem like good priors with a posterior $\text{Gamma}(a+n,\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\log(X_i)+b)$ . To find the posterior: $$P(\alpha|X)\propto P(X|\alpha)P(\alpha)\propto\alpha^n e^{-\alpha\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log(X_i)}e^{-b\alpha}\alpha^{a-1}$$ . Adding the like terms gives us the posterior.
To find the Bayes estimate we minimize with respect to $t$ , we consider the following Bayes risk function $$\int \ell(t,\alpha)f(\alpha|\underline{X})d\alpha=\int \frac{1}{\alpha^2}(t-\alpha^2)^2f(\alpha|\underline{X})d\alpha.$$ Since $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{1}{\alpha^2}(t-\alpha^2)^2=\frac{2t}{\alpha^2}-2$ and $\int (\frac{2t}{\alpha^2}-2)f(\alpha|\underline{X})d\alpha<\infty$ , we have $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int \ell(t,\alpha)f(\alpha|\underline{X})d\alpha=2\int \left(\frac{t}{\alpha^2}-1\right)f(\alpha|\underline{X})d\alpha
= 2tE\bigg[\frac{1}{\alpha^2}\bigg|\underline{X}\bigg]-2.$$ Setting this equal to $0$ implies the Bayes estimate is $$\hat{t}=\frac{1}{E\bigg[\frac{1}{\alpha^2}\bigg|\underline{X}\bigg]}.$$ Define $R=\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\log(X_i)$ .
Then \begin{align}
E\bigg[\frac{1}{\alpha^2}\bigg|\underline{X}\bigg]
& =\int \alpha^{-2}\frac{(R+b)^{n+a}}{\Gamma(n+a)}\alpha^{n+a-1}e^{-\alpha(R+b)}d\alpha \\
& = \frac{(R+b)^{n+a}}{\Gamma(n+a)}\frac{\Gamma(n+a-2)}{(R+b)^{n+a-2}}\int \frac{(R+b)^{n+a-2}}{\Gamma(n+a-2)}\alpha^{n+a-2-1}e^{-\alpha(R+b)}d\alpha \\
& =\frac{(R+b)^{n+a}}{\Gamma(n+a)}\frac{\Gamma(n+a-2)}{(R+b)^{n+a-2}} \\
& =\frac{(R+b)^2}{(n+a)(n+a-1)}
\end{align} Then $\hat{t}=\frac{(n+a)(n+a-1)}{(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\log(X_i)+b)^2}$ . I am asked to find the asymptotic distribution as well. We have $\frac{(n+a)(n+a-1)}{(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\log(X_i)+b)^2}\stackrel{p}\to\alpha^2$ so it is a consistent estimator. I am trying to use the Central Limit Theorem, but need to find the variance, is my work up to now correct?

I know there is the exercise treating the general case in Marcus's $\textit{Number Fields}$ , but I am interested in keeping the computations straightforward and limited to this concrete example.

3577406,Affine conics over an algebraically closed field of char 2,"The following argument classifies affine conics over an algebraically closed field $k$ with char $(k)\neq 2.$ But I don't see where it uses the hypothesis that char $(k)\neq 2.$ Is it an unnecessary hypothesis? Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field with char $(k)\neq2$ and let $Q(x,y)$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree 2 in $k[x,y].$ We write $Q(x,y)=ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+ey+f$ for some $a,\ldots,f \in k.$ Since $k$ is algebraically closed, we have $$Q(x,y)=L_1L_2+L_3+f$$ where $L_3=dx+ef$ and $L_1,L_2$ are linear forms in $k[x,y]$ such that $L_1L_2=ax^2+bxy+cy^2.$ We split into two cases: (1) $L_1\sim L_2$ and  (2) $L_1\not\sim L_2.$ (1) If $L_1\sim L_2,$ then $L_2=\lambda L_1$ for some $\lambda \in k^\times$ and we have $Q(x,y)=\lambda L_1^2 + L_3 + f.$ Since $k$ is algebraically closed and $Q(x,y)$ is irreducible in $k[x,y],$ it follows that $L_1\not\sim L_3.$ Therefore $(u,v)=(\sqrt{-\lambda}L_1,\,L_3+f)$ is an affine change of coordinates such that $$Q(x,y)=v-u^2.$$ (2) If $L_1\not\sim L_2,$ then there exist $\lambda,\mu \in k$ such that $L_3=\lambda L_1+\mu L_2.$ As such, we have $Q(x,y)=(L_1+\mu)(L_2+\lambda)-(\lambda\mu-f).$ Since $Q(x,y)$ is irreducible in $k[x,y],$ it follows that $\lambda\mu-f\neq 0.$ Therefore $(u,v)=\left(\dfrac{L_1+\mu}{\sqrt{\lambda\mu-f}}\,,\dfrac{L_2+\lambda}{\sqrt{\lambda\mu-f}}\right)$ is an affine change of coordinates such that $$Q(x,y)\sim uv-1.$$ If $L_1=\alpha x+ \beta y$ and $L_2=\gamma x + \delta y,$ then $L_1\sim L_2$ if and only if $\alpha\delta-\beta\gamma=0.$ Moreover, since $L_1L_2=ax^2+bxy+cy^2,$ we have $$(\alpha\delta-\beta\gamma)^2=(\alpha\delta+\beta\gamma)^2-4(\alpha\gamma)(\beta\delta)=b^2-4ac.$$ It thus follows that $$k[x,y]/(Q(x,y))\cong \left\{\begin{array}{ll}

3577636,Invertibility in the Complex Group Ring,"Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete group, and let $\Bbb{C}[\Gamma]$ be the associated complex group ring. If $\sum_{g \in \Gamma} a_g g$ represents some element in the group ring, where all but finitely many of the $a_g \in \Bbb{C}$ are nonzero, then we can equip $\Bbb{C}[\Gamma]$ with the follow natural involution: $$\left(\sum_{g \in \Gamma} a_g g \right)^* := \sum_{g \in \Gamma} \overline{a_g} g^{-1}$$ This gives us a notion of self-adjoint elemnts ( $f^* = f$ for $f \in \Bbb{C}[\Gamma]$ ) and positive elements (those of the form $\sum h_i^* h_i$ for $h_i \in \Bbb{C}[\Gamma]$ ). From here we can get an ordering on the self-adjoint elements: $f \le g$ if and only if $g - f$ is positive. I am wondering whether the following is true: Let $f \in \Bbb{C}[\Gamma]$ be a positive element. Then $f$ is invertible in $\Bbb{C}[\Gamma]$ if and only if there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $f \ge \epsilon 1$ . I know this is true for $C^*$ -algebras, and I suspect that the proof just amounts to $C^*$ -algebraic tricks. For example, the forward direction is trivial, because if $f$ is invertible in $\Bbb{C}[\Gamma]$ , then it is invertible in the full group $C^*$ -algebra $C^*(\Gamma)$ , which is just the completion of $\Bbb{C}[\Gamma]$ with respect to a particular norm (see this ). However, the other direction is not obvious. If $f \ge \epsilon 1$ for some $\epsilon > 0$ , then $f$ is invertible in $C^*(\Gamma)$ . But why must its inverse live in $\Bbb{C}[\Gamma]$ ?

Then, out of the 8 remaining books, you pick 2 random books, which has 8*7 permutations.  In terms of order, there are 6 total combinations for ordering of biography B and other books X (BBXX, BXBX, BXXB, XBBX, XBXB, XXBB).  Thus the solution should be 4*3*8*7*6 The other method I used is as follow: (# of total permutations) - (# of permutations with no biography) - (# of permutations with exactly 1 biography) $$

\dfrac{10!}{6!}-\dfrac{6!}{2!}-\dfrac{6!}{3!}*4*4=

Should I therefore divide by $2$ to get the accurate favorable number of ways?
so required probability will be $\frac{\binom{5}{2} \binom{95}{1}}{\binom{100}{3}*2}$ Solution 3: Total number of ways = $\binom{100}{3} * 3!$ (counting in way to account for order) Favorable number of ways = $\left(\binom{5}{2} * 2!\right) * \left(\binom{95}{1} * 1!\right)$ (to also account for order like in denominator) So required probability = $\frac{\binom{5}{2} * \binom{95}{1}}{\binom{100}{3} *3}$ ) I understand that as long as we are consistent in taking in to account the order when counting favorable and total ways, we should get the same probability.

For example, if a reduced residue system for $12$ is $a = \{1,5,7,11\}$ , and we have also $\{13,17,19,23\}$ , would the reduced residue class be the general description of this? e.g all the terms that are equal to the terms in $a \mod 12$ ? Is the reduced residue class the same as the set of all congruence classes?","['number-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
3578439,Proof of Klingenberg's lemma in do Carmo's Riemannian Geometry,"The following is Exercise 10.1 in Riemannian Geometry by M. do Carmo. (Klingenberg's Lemma). Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature $K<K_0$ , where $K_0$ is a positive constant. Let $p,q\in M$ and let $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ be two distinct geodesics joining $p$ to $q$ with $\ell(\gamma_0)<\ell(\gamma_1)$ . Assume that $\gamma_0$ is homotopic to $\gamma_1$ , that is, there exists a continuous family of curves $\alpha_t$ , $t\in[0,1]$ such that $\alpha_0=\gamma_0$ and $\alpha_1=\gamma_1$ . Prove that there exists $t_0\in(0,1]$ such that $$\ell(\gamma_0)+\ell(\alpha_{t_0})\geq\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{K_0}}.$$ The hint goes: Hint: Assume $\ell(\gamma_0)<\pi/\sqrt{K_0}$ (otherwise, we have nothing to prove). From Ranch's Theorem, $\exp_p:TpM\to M$ has no critical point in the open ball $B$ of radius $\pi/\sqrt{K_0}$ , centered at $p$ . For $t$ small, it is possible to lift the curve at to the tangent space $T_pM$ , i.e., there exists a curve $\widetilde{\alpha}_t$ in $T_pM$ , joining $\exp_p^{-1}(0)=0$ to $\exp_p^{-1}(q)=\widetilde{q}$ , such that $\exp_p\circ\widetilde{\alpha}_t=\alpha_t$ . It is clear that it is not possible to do the same for every $t\in[0,1]$ , since $\gamma_1$ cannot be lifted keeping the endpoints fixed. We conclude that for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $t(\varepsilon)$ such that $\alpha_{t(\varepsilon)}$ can be lifted to $\tilde{\alpha}_{t(\varepsilon)}$ and $\tilde{\alpha}_{t(\varepsilon)}$ contains points with distance $<\varepsilon$ from the boundary $\partial B$ of $B$ . In the contrary case, for some $\varepsilon>0$ , all lifts $\tilde{\alpha}_t$ are at the distance $\geq\varepsilon$ from $\partial B$ ; the set of $t$ 's for which it is possible to lift $\alpha_t$ will then be open and closed and $\alpha_1$ could be lifted, which is a contradiction. Therefore, for all $\varepsilon>0$ , we have $$\ell(\gamma_0)+\ell(\alpha_{t(\varepsilon)})\geq\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{K_0}}-\varepsilon.$$ Now choose a sequence $\{\varepsilon_n\}\to0$ , and consider a convergent subsequence of $\{t(\varepsilon_n)\}\to t_0$ . Then there exists a curve $\alpha_{t_0}$ with $$\ell(\gamma_0)+\ell(\alpha_{t_0})\geq\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{K_0}}.$$ Why do such liftings exist? We only know that $\exp_p$ is nonsingular on $B(0,R):=\{v\in T_pM:|v|<R\}$ , not that $\exp_p|_{B(0,R)}$ is a covering map or anything. Local diffeomorphisms can behave badly when it comes to lifting curves! So here is my question: Let $(M,g)$ be a complete Riemannian manifold and $p\in M$ . Suppose $\exp_p$ is nonsingular everywhere on $B(0,R)\subset T_pM$ . Does any curve on $M$ starting from $p$ with length $<R$ lift to a curve on $T_pM$ starting at $0$ ? What about homotopies of such curves? In particular, why does the hint works?

When and in which paper did Klingenberg prove this?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

I get that they both have dimension $|G|$ as $\bar{k}$ -algebra, that the $G$ -invariants are $\bar{k}$ in both case, and that this boils down to finding a basis of the form $(x, g_1.x,\ldots,g_{n-1}.x)$ of $A \otimes_k \bar{k}$ . I know that in the case that $A$ is a finite separable extension of $k$ , then being Galois and being a normal extension is the same, and $G$ is then the Galois group of $A$ .

Short Version Why is it enough for the tangent plane to only agree with the slope of a differentiable 2-input function in the $x$ and $y$ directions at a certain point for it to agree in every direction at that point? Isn’t it still possible for the function to cross the tangent plane, even if their slopes agree in the $x$ an $y$ directions, when we move in some other direction? Long Version Say we have some two-input differentiable function $f(x,y)$ defining some surface in 3D space. The input into the function is $(x,y)$ coordinates, and the output of the function is the height of the surface (or hill) at each input point. Consider some point $(x_0,y_0)$ on this surface. At this point, the surface will have an infinite number of slopes, since there are an infinite number of directions we can move in. However, for two of those directions, the slopes are easy to find: The slope is $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ in the $x$ direction. The slope is $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ in the $y$ direction. For a plane to be tangent to a function at $(x_0,y_0)$ , it means it only touches the surface at that point, and doesn't cross the surface anywhere. When we find a tangent plane to the surface at $(x_0,y_0)$ , its enough to make the slope of the plane agree with the slope of the surface in 2 directions. Usually the $x$ and $y$ directions. I'm aware that two slopes, one in the $x$ and one in the $y$ , uniquely define a single plane at that point. However, there are an infinite number of functions that may have those slopes at that point. Tangency implies that the slope of the tangent plane agrees with the slope of the function at that point in every direction, not just the $x$ and $y$ directions. If it didn't agree with the slope of the function at that point in some arbitrary direction, then were we to draw lines in that direction on both the ""tangent"" (not actually tangent) plane and the function, those lines would intersect, and thus the plane wouldn't be brushing the surface at only a single point, and it wouldn't be a tangent plane. Why is it enough for the tangent plane to only agree with the slope of a differentiable 2-input function in the $x$ and $y$ directions at a certain point for it to agree in every direction at that point? Isn’t it still possible for the function to cross the tangent plane, even if their slopes agree in the $x$ an $y$ directions, when we move in some other direction? I'd like to be able to see the answer intuitively...but I can't, and I need help. Thank you! Edit: I added this as a comment to David's answer below, but I'll add it as part of the question too, as I think it may help communicate what I'm trying to ""see"". Take the function $f(x)=x^2$ . That's a parabola in 2D space. If a tangent line agrees with the slope $2x$ at a certain point...well, there's only one slope to agree with, so I KNOW that the line will be tangent. But, now take the surface $f(x,y)=x^2$ . That's a surface in 3D space. A tangent plane at a certain point must have a slope of $2x$ in the $x$ direction and $0$ in the $y$ direction Lines drawn on a certain ""tangent"" plane in those two directions will be tangent to the surface at that point, since the slopes agree in those two directions. We used those directions (the $x$ and $y$ directions) to define the plane. But, how can I intuitively ""see"" that lines drawn on the plane in ANY direction will be tangent to the function at that point? Edit 2 As someone pointed out in the comments, a tangent line doesn't not crossing the function only applies if the function is convex (or concave) like $x^2$ . Here, let me draw out the function, and draw a tangent line to $f(x)=x^2$ . The tangent line (blue) agrees with the slope of the function (red) in the one direction it has to agree with the slope in (the $x$ direction). Therefor, I know that the tangent line won't cross the parabola. If it didn't agree with the slope, then it would cross it either when we moved a little bit towards the right from the point of tangency, or a little bit towards the left. However, lets say we draw a tangent plane the graph of $f(x,y)=x^2$ , with a tangent plane drawn to it. Although I know lines on the plane won't cross the surface when moving in the $x$ direction or in the $y$ direction (the two white tangent lines won't cross the $x^2$ surface) since the plane agrees with the slope of the surface in those two directions, how can I know that if I draw lines on the plane in some other arbitrary direction, those lines also won't cross the surface? Why was the slope agreeing in the $x$ and $y$ directions enough to define the tangent plane? Thanks! Final Thoughts: After watching some of Ted's (in the comments) lectures on YouTube, I've realized that when I asked this question, although I had an intuitive ""feel"" for differentiability in one dimension, I hadn't really thought enough about what it meant in higher dimensions. Differentiability (for a two dimensional surface) means that the function is locally flat. Say that $T(x ⃗ )$ is the tangent plane to a function $f(x ⃗ )$ at a point $a ⃗$ . Therefor, it must agree with the slopes of $f(x ⃗ )$ in every direction at $a ⃗$ , not just the $m$ Cartesian directions, for which we have the partial derivatives of $f(x ⃗ )$ . However, when we define $T(x ⃗ )$ , we only make it agree with the slopes of $f(x ⃗ )$ in the $m$ Cartesian directions. $$T(x ⃗ )=\frac{∂f}{∂x_0} (x_0-a_0 )+\frac{∂f}{∂x_1}(x_1-a_1 )+⋯+\frac{∂f}{∂x_m}(x_m-a_m )$$ (Each of the $x_i$ 's are orthogonal Cartesian coordinates, they're the components of the input vector $\vec{x}$ , and each of the partial derivatives above are evaluated at $\vec{a}$ ). This is because given the $m$ partial derivatives of $f$ at $\vec{a}$ , there’s only one unique hyper-plane approximation for $f(x ⃗ )$ which can be defined!! That is, the $m$ partial derivatives of $f(x ⃗ )$ at $a ⃗$ define a unique hyper-plane. There is no other hyper-plane that has $m$ slopes and passes through $(\vec{a}, f(\vec{a}))$ in $(m+1)$ dimensional space ( $m+1$ because we're adding one more dimension for the function's output itself) . My original question was why this implied that the tangent plane agreed with the slopes in every direction. The answer? It doesn't! It's entirely possible for this ""tangent"" (in quotations because in this case, it's not actually tangent) to agree with the slopes in the $m$ Cartesian directions, but not in every direction (Ted has some good examples in the lectures referenced in the comments, and here's a picture from ""Math-Insight"") . However, if that unique “tangent” plane doesn’t agree with the function’s slopes in every direction (not only the Cartesian directions) that just means that the function isn’t differentiable at $a ⃗$ !!! In other words, at $\vec{a}$ the function isn't locally flat. To prove that a function is differentiable at $\vec{a}$ , we attempt to build a ""tangent"" plane at that point by making it agree with the slope of our function in the $m$ Cartesian directions, and then show that the ""tangent plane"" indeed is a tangent-plane by showing that... $$\mathrm{lim_{(|dx ⃗ |→0)}}(\frac{⁡[(f(a ⃗+dx ⃗ )-f(a ⃗ )]-[T(a ⃗+dx ⃗ )-T(a ⃗ )])}{|dx ⃗ |})=0$$ ...regardless of the direction in which we move from $\vec{a}$ (regardless of the direction of $\vec{dx}$ ) . In his videos, Ted shows an example of this (with the difference that in his example, $T(\vec{x})$ is not a tangent plane but a linear approximation passing through the origin, although the idea is the same.) In a nutshell, to answer my original question, if the function is differentiable, then it’s enough for the tangent plane to agree with the slope of the function in the $m$ Cartesian directions for it to agree in every direction, because $m$ slopes define a unique tangent-plane in $m+1$ dimensional space, and that the tangent plane agrees with the slopes of the function in every direction is just the definition of differentiability - that the function is locally flat. And to show that a function indeed is differentiable, we have to show that a potential unique ""tangent"" (in quotes because it may not be a tangent plane if the function isn't differentiable) plane to the function at a certain point that agrees with the slope of the function in the $m$ Cartesian directions agrees with the slope of the function in every direction, so that the function indeed is locally flat.

3579346,Abstract definition of tangent space,"I've been learning some introductory analysis on manifolds and have had a small issue ever since the notion of tangent spaces at points on a differentiable manifold was introduced. In our lectures, we began with the definition using equivalence classes of curves. But it is also possible to define tangent spaces using derivations of smooth functions (and apparently several other ways too, but for now I'm only familiar with these two). It seems intuitively sensible to call both these pictures (the curve and derivative ones) ""equivalent"": let the point of interest be $p$ and pick a local chart $\phi$ . Then we form a quotient of the set of curves through $p$ (parametrized so that $p=\gamma(0)$ ), declaring $\gamma_1\sim\gamma_2$ iff $(\phi\,\circ\,\gamma_1)'(0)=(\phi\,\circ\,\gamma_2)'(0)$ . This is one particular version of a tangent space at $p$ . But we could also define it as the space of derivations, i.e. linear maps from $C^\infty(M)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the Leibnitz rule $$D(fg)=D(f)g(p)+f(p)D(g)$$ For any equivalence class of curves $[\gamma]$ at $p$ , the operator defined on $C^\infty(M)$ by $$
D_{[\gamma]}(f)=(f\circ\gamma)'(0)
$$ is a derivation; conversely, it is true that every derivation is such a directional derivative (proof: Equivalence of definitions of tangent space ). Most of this a recap of a part of Wikipedia . At any rate, both of these notions seem to give in some sense ""the same"" tangent spaces. Here is my problem: I don't actually understand what precisely it is we are checking for when trying to decide if some two definitions are equivalent; right now, all I would personally try to do is show isomorphism of vector spaces and then try to convince myself that this isomorphism respects some vague notion of direction. But then $\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{dim}(M)}$ is certainly isomorphic to any tangent space of the manifold $M$ , at least as a vector space. Nevertheless, just declaring $T_pM=\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{dim}(M)}$ doesn't strike me as a successful construction of a tangent space. Now, there are two levels to my question, ordered by ""degree of abstraction"", so to speak (presumably they also get harder to answer). I do, however, believe they are connected. First, is there some precise notion of vector space isomorphisms respecting direction on a manifold? Specifically, is $\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{dim}(M)}$ a valid tangent space or is it not, or do I perhaps have to specify some additional structure on it and then check that the additional structure relates to, say, the curve definition in a correct way? (I suppose this last case would require taking one definition of the tangent space as the absolute foundation and comparing all others to it, which I find somewhat unsatisfying.) Second, is there perhaps an abstract, ""external"" definition of a tangent space? What I'm talking about could be something like, ""Given a smooth manifold $M$ , a point $p\in M$ and a vector space $V$ , this vector space is called a tangent space at $p$ if it satisfies some properties $X,Y,Z...$ "" where these $X,Y,Z$ don't depend on the type of objects in $V$ or other particular details specific to $V$ . The motivation behind asking this is related to the situation with ordered pairs of objects (yes, this is quite a leap): I can use the Kuratowski definition or infinitely many others, and in each case, I will be able to eventually convince myself that, indeed, this thing before me works just as well to encode ""ordered-ness"" of objects as any other. But I don't have to keep referring to one of these specific cases, I just need to describe how pairs should arise and behave in general: there is a two-place function $f$ that sends two objects $x$ and $y$ to $(x,y)$ and there are two projections $\pi_1,\pi_2$ that pull $x$ and $y$ back out. (For a precise definition see this PDF , I summarised the discussion from there. It goes on to define products also within category theory.) Furthermore, I would find it highly suspect if some theorem about ordered pairs referred to the particulars of the Kuratowski definition - all the relevant information about $(x,y)$ should be recoverable from just the abstract setup described above (or better yet, in the linked PDF). Is there some way of treating tangent spaces in this same spirit? I know this question is vague, but I honestly don't know how better to phrase it, I hope I've at least gotten the mindset across if nothing else.","['smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

3579450,Finite Rings and Product of Finite Fields,"Here is the problem which I got inspired from, which is from one of our school's prelim exam: Prove or disprove: If $R$ is a finite, commutative ring with unit, then it is a product of fields. It is obviously true if $R$ has prime order (because in this case $R$ itself is a field). Now it remains the case with non-prime order. Since $R$ is finite order, if it can be written as a product of fields, then all the fields must be finite. By considering the total number of elements, it is natural to consider the prime factorization of the order of $R$ . In order to see the statement is true or false, I consider first as an example the ring $R=\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$ . If it is a product of finite fields, then it can only be $F=\mathbb{F}_2\times\mathbb{F}_3$ . It turns out the function $\phi:R\to F$ given by $\phi(0)=(0,0)$ , $\phi(1)=(1,1)$ , $\phi(2)=(0,2)$ , $\phi(3)=(1,0)$ , $\phi(4)=(0,1)$ , $\phi(5)=(1,2)$ gives an isomorphism. In fact, it is THE isomorphism. Given the example above, this makes me believe that the statement is true. However, problems continue to arise as I attempted to prove it: (1) Given any finite commutative unital ring with order $n$ , is it true that $R\cong \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ ? (2) We can consider two ""types"" of factorization and the proofs will go differently: If we let $n=p_1\cdots p_k$ be the prime factorization of $n$ , then we consider the field product $\mathbb{F}_{p_1}\times\cdots\times \mathbb{F}_{p_k}$ . If we let $n=p_1^{n_1}\cdots p_k^{n_k}$ to be the prime factorization and requiring all $p_i$ are distinct, then we can consider the field product $\mathbb{F}_{p_1^{n_1}}\times\cdots\times \mathbb{F}_{p_k^{n_k}}$ (3) How do one even construct an isomorphism? The one shown in our example seems to have no pattern at all. If the statement is actually false, I would like to see some counterexamples.

This polarization induces the Weyl pairings $X[N]\times X[N]\rightarrow \mu_N$ on the $N$ -torsion subgroups of $X$ , for any integer $N$ . These pairings are alternate (symplectic when $N$ is prime to the degree of $\lambda$ ).

Taking the restricted product of these groups for $l\not = p$ , we obtain the group $H_1(X,\mathbb A^p_f)$ where $\mathbb A^p_f$ is the ring of finite adèles away from $p$ , which is equipped with an alternate pairing to $\mathbb A_f^p(1)$ . Eventually, the étale fundamental group of $X$ is given by $\pi_1(X)=\prod_{l\text{ any prime}}T_l(X)$ . This group acts on $H_1(X,\mathbb A^p_f)$ by addition componentwise, forgetting about the $p$ -component. In Kottwitz paper ""Points on some Shimura varieties over finite field"" in chapter $5$ , it is claimed that $\pi_1(X)$ acts by similitudes on $H_1(X,\mathbb A^p_f)$ . I fail to see why it is true, and I need help for this purpose. If I interpret the statement componentwise, I believe it should mean that for any $l\not = p$ , there exists some scalar $c\in \mathbb Q_l^{\times}$ such that for any $x,y\in V_l(X)$ and $a\in T_l(X)$ , $E_l(x+a,y+a)=cE_l(x,y)$ in $\mathbb Q_l(1)$ . I can't not see why this would hold... Edit: I believe that my interpretation in the last paragraph must be totally wrong. If I consider $l$ prime to the degree of $\lambda$ , then the pairing $E_l$ is symplectic. Assuming that my last statement were true, first I see that $c\not = 1$ : otherwise I would have $E_l(x,a)+E_l(a,y)=E_l(x-y,a)=0$ for every $x,y$ and $a$ as above, which for a fixed $a$ implies $a=0$ , that is absurd.  But if $c\not = 1$ , simply taking $a=0$ gives an absurdity. This adds up to my confusion, I would gladly appreciate any explanation about how I ought to understand ""by similitudes"" here.","['fundamental-groups', 'algebraic-geometry', 'arithmetic-geometry', 'abelian-varieties']"

What can you say about a? Justify your answer. Solution: Obviously $a=0$ is a solution to the identity $$\sin(\sqrt{x+a})=\sin(\sqrt{x}), \forall x\ge 0.$$ Now let us assume that $\exists a>0$ , such that $$\sin(\sqrt{x+a})=\sin(\sqrt{x}), \forall x\ge 0.$$ Since we have $\sin(\sqrt{x+a})=\sin(\sqrt{x})$ for all $x\ge 0$ and for some constant $a>0$ , this implies that if we fix $x$ , then we can conclude that $$\sqrt{x+a}=n\pi+(-1)^n\sqrt{x}\text{, where $n$ is an integer such that }\sqrt{x+a}>0.$$ Squaring both sides we have $$x+a=n^2\pi^2+(-1)^n2n\pi\sqrt{x}+x\\ \implies a=n^2\pi^2+(-1)^n2n\pi\sqrt{x}\hspace{0.5 cm}...(*)$$ $(*)$ helps us in concluding that $a$ is a function of $n$ and $x$ and it is not a constant, and more specifically we have $$a(n,x)=n^2\pi^2+(-1)^n2n\pi\sqrt{x},$$ which is a contradiction to our assumption that $a>0$ is a constant.

The converse is also true: if all of its irreducible representations are of one dimension, then that group is abelian. What interests me is to what extent can we detect nonabelianity from this information. To be more precise, I'd like to argue that nonabelian groups do not have $1$ -dimensional representations other than the trivial one. However, this is a false statement because the permutation group $S_3$ over $3$ elements has a nontrivial yet $1$ -dimensional representations. But that representation comes from induction from its normal subgroup $A_3$ ! Therefore my guess should be modify so that the group is simple. The simplest nonabelian simple group is $A_5$ .

It is not hard to show that the equation has exactly one positive solution (just differentiate and use induction). Roughly, it measures how good of an approximation is the Taylor expansion of $e^x$ upto $k$ terms. Thus, as $k$ increases, we can expect $x$ to increase as well, as the accuracy of the expansion increases farther from the origin. We can get an lower bound on $x$ by the Taylor's theorem on $e^x$ , as the remainder here is $\frac{e^x}{2}$ , so $\frac{e^x}{2} \leq \frac{e^x}{k!}x^k$ which implies $\sqrt[k]{\frac{k!}{2}} \leq x$ . Thus by Stirling's formula, we see that the lower bound is almost $\frac{k}{e}$ . My first idea was to use binary search, by simply computing the entire function and checking its sign. I coded it up in Python, but unfortunately, it only works for values of $k$ upto about $1000$ . Beyond that, the values get too big to fit in its numeric data type. I tried many other ways, like Newton's method which did not work out, amongst other things. The main problem here is I can't find a way to avoid computing the entire function (which will overflow).

3579795,$k$-algebra morphisms from formal power series ring,"Background/Motivation: I was playing around with a certain construction that I am trying to generalize and therefore needed to compute some examples to get a feel for the situation. I realized that I don't really feel comfortable with $\text{Hom}_k(k[[t]],-)$ for some field $k$ , i.e. with $k$ -algebra morphisms from a formal power series ring. One of the first examples I considered led to the following question: The question: Let $k$ be an arbitrary field and consider the set of $k$ -algebra homomorphisms $\text{Hom}_k(k[[t]],k)$ . How do the elements look like? My thoughts: At first it feels like such a morphism is determined by the value of $t$ which cannot be since 1) The $k$ -algebra morphism doesnt allow us to commute with our infinite (formal) sums. 2) Then we would have $k[[t]] \cong k[t]$ as this is the universal property of the polynomial ring as free $k$ -algebra. So that is not what we are looking for.
We certainly have the $t \mapsto 0$ morphism, but if $t$ is not sent to $0$ , I am confused. Somehow it feels like the set of these morphisms is given (rather: can be identified) by all elements $a \in k$ , such that all these formals sums ""converge"" if I plug in $a$ . But now $k$ is not necessarily a topological field and hence talking about convergence does not seem to be the correct way of thinking. Thus ""converge"" should mean define an element in $k$ here, but I don't really know.","['formal-power-series', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"

The mapping $R: \varrho(T) \to L(H)$ , $R_{\lambda} = R(\lambda) := (\lambda I - T)^{-1}$ is called the resolvent mapping. Theorem. Let $T$ be as above. $\varrho(T)$ is open. The resolvent mapping is analytic and the resolvent identity $$
R_{\lambda} - R_{\mu} = (\mu - \lambda) R_{\lambda} R_{\mu}
$$ holds. Proof. 1. Let $\lambda_0 \in \varrho(T)$ and $| \lambda - \lambda_0 | < \| R_{\lambda_0} \|^{-1}$ . 
Then $$ \tag{1}
\lambda I - T
= (\lambda_0 I - T) + (\lambda - \lambda_0) I

$$ Hence $\lambda I - T$ is invertible. A formal calculations yields $$
(\lambda I - T)(\mu I - T) \left[ ( \lambda I - T)^{-1} - (\mu I - T)^{-1}\right] = (\mu - \lambda) I
$$ and a similar identity can be derived by multiplying from the right side. So, only the (easy) inspection of domains is missing. $\square$ Questions What does it mean for the resolvent mapping to be analytic? Is it that we can write it as $R_{\lambda} = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n T^n$ ? Does this follow from $(1)$ since $(1)$ implies $$
(\lambda I - T)^{-1}
= \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} ((\lambda_0 - \lambda) (\lambda_0 I - T))^n \cdot (\lambda_0 I - T)^{-1}
= \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} (\lambda_0 - \lambda)^n (\lambda_0 I - T)^{n - 1} \ ?
