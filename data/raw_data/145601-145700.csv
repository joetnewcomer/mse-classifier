2379889,Proving $|\cos z\ |^2 + |\sin z\ |^2 \geq 1$,"My attempt: For $z :=x+iy$, $$\cos z =\cos x \cos iy - \sin x \sin iy \\ = \cos x \cosh y - i \sin x \sinh y\\ \sin z = \sin x \cosh y + i \cos x \sinh y$$ So $$|\cos z\ |^2 + |\sin z\ |^2 = \cos ^2 x \cosh ^2 y + \sin ^2 x \sinh ^2 y + \cosh^2 y \sin^2x + \cos ^2x \sinh ^2 y\\ = \cos ^2x ( \cosh ^2 y + \sinh ^2 y) + \sin ^2 x (\cosh^2 y + \sinh^2 y) \\ = \cos 2y \leq 1.$$ I'm not sure where I went wrong, and a numerical check on Wolfram Alpha shows that the inequality should be $\geq$ as suggested.","['trigonometry', 'analysis']"

2379913,Motivation for predicate logic.,"I am studying  predicate logic,I came across this para- Propositional logic, studied in Sections 1.1–1.3, cannot adequately express the meaning of all statements in mathematics and in natural language. For example, suppose that we know that
  “Every computer connected to the university network is functioning properly.” No rules of propositional logic allow us to conclude the truth of the statement “MATH3 is functioning properly"",where MATH3 is one of the computers connected to the university network. This is supposed to illustrate the motivation for predicate logic. However,we can interpret the given statement as the conjunction of statements of the form ""MATHx is connected to the university network and is working properly"" . As this statement is true and is a conjunction the individual propositions have to be true;in terms of MATH3 too. So propositional logic expresses the meaning of the statement adequately and we have also used the rules of propositional logic to conclude the truth about MATH3 contrary to whats been stated . What am I missing?I have gone through the notes by Stephen Simpson and Wikipedia but they proved inadequate.","['first-order-logic', 'predicate-logic', 'propositional-calculus', 'logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Now instead, is possible to solve the following for $b$ also fixed? $$ \min_{x} \left\| A - x b^T \right\|_{\text{F}}^2$$ If this is possible, is there also a way to solve $$ \min_{x} \left\| A - x b^T \right\|_{\text{F}}^2 + \left\| C - x d^T \right\|_{\text{F}}^2$$ where I think of $x$ as the best ""average"" solution between the two parts of the cost function?

2380014,Complex symplectic group and geometry?,"This question is somewhat silly; I'm a bit confused and asking for clarification. A symplectic manifold is a (real) manifold equipped with a closed non-degenerate 2-form, or equivalently an integrable $\text{Sp}(2n, \mathbb{R})$-structure. The group $\text{Sp}(2n, \mathbb{R})$ is defined as the group of linear automorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n \oplus \mathbb{R}^n$ which preserve the standard symplectic form $$ \omega = dx_1 \wedge dy_1 + \cdots + dx_n \wedge dy_n $$ There also exists the group $\text{Sp}(2n, \mathbb{C})$, and that's the one I'm a bit confused about. As far as I can see, it seems to be again defined as the group of linear automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^n \oplus \mathbb{C}^n$ preserving a form defined by the same formula as above, but apparently it might not? Furthermore, I'm curious as to the geometrical significance of this complex symplectic group. For example, do people study manifolds equipped with integrable $\text{Sp}(2n, \mathbb{C})$-structures? Those would need to have real dimension $4n$, I suppose. My first instinct was to guess such a thing would be a symplectic structure plus a compatible complex structure -- but there's no reason for such things to require real dimension a multiple of $4$, is there? I don't really understand what's going on here, as I think I've never heard of using this group to do symplectic geometry.","['complex-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'symplectic-geometry']"
2380017,Proving a key theorem for an additive but not sigma additive measure,"I am confused by a maths book I am reading. It says: let $\mu$ be a measure that is additive but not $\sigma$ additive, prove that theorem 1 still continues to hold, despite the non-$\sigma$ additivity. And this theorem 1 is the following: Theorem 1:
Let $\mu$ be a $\sigma$ additive measure on a semiring $F_{\mu}$, and suppose the sets $A,A_{1},A_{2},A_{3} $... where $A_{1},A_{2},A_{3}... $are pairwise disjoint sets of $A$, all belong to $F_{\mu}$, then $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty }\mu\left ( A_{k} \right )\leqslant \mu\left ( A \right )$ Does this theorem 1 really hold without $\sigma$ additivity? If so, how do I prove it? I am confused because the theorem appears to require $\sigma$ additivity to hold.

\[c(v_1,v_2)=(cv_1,cv_2)\]

$$v=v_1+v_2$$
for $v_i \in V_i$ then $V=V_1\oplus V_2$. I cannot see how this makes sense given the definition above. Is the above definition wrong? If not how can $V$ have the form $(v_1,v_2)$ when $v_1,v_2 \in V$?","['direct-sum', 'linear-algebra']"
2380118,Let $f:\Bbb R\rightarrow\Bbb R$ be such that $|f(x)-f(y)|\le M|x-y|^\alpha$.

Attempt If $f$ is not constant, then there exists $x,y$ such that $x\neq y\Rightarrow f(x)\neq f(y)$. Then, $0<|f(x)-f(y)|$. Between any two distinct real numbers, we can always find a real number. Let's pick a real number between $0$ and $|f(x)-f(y)|$, and call that number $c$. 
Then, $0<c<|f(x)-f(y)|$. Now let's look at $|x-y|$, which is also greater than $0$. For our $c$, no matter what positive number we have picked, and no matter how large $|x-y|$ is, it is possible to pick $M>0$ arbitrarily close to $0$ and $\alpha>1$ arbitrarily close to $1$ so that \begin{align*}\sqrt[\alpha] {c\over M}>|x-y|&\Rightarrow M|x-y|^\alpha <c<|f(x)-f(y)|\\&\Rightarrow |f(x)-f(y)|>M|x-y|^\alpha\end{align*} But, the problem states that $|f(x)-f(y)|\le M|x-y|^\alpha$, so the only way to meet this condition is if $f(x)=f(y)$ regardless of our choice of $x,y$. If $f(x)=f(y)$ regardless of our choice of $x,y$, then this means that $f$ is constant. End of Attempt To be honest, I don't have a clue if I'm even doing anything correctly...

2380235,Proof of Kummer's theorem regarding regular primes,"I was reading a proof of the above stated theorem ( see here ), and I am in need of clarification for a step in the main proof (page 7 in the above link). Briefly outlining, (asumming $p$ is a prime greater than 3) it states to suppose that $x \equiv y \equiv -z$ (mod $p$). Substituting into the given equation ($x^p+y^p=z^p$) gives the congurence: $-2z \equiv -2z^p \equiv x^p+y^p = z^p \equiv z \text{ (mod }p), \hspace{0.5in} (1)$ (Where these equivalences are all due to Fermat's little theorem.) This then implies that $3z \equiv 0$ (mod $p$), contradicting the fact that $p>3$ and an earlier assumption that $(p,z)=1$. Okay, so this is fine and intuitive, and results in a reduction of our assumption, to $x \equiv y \not\equiv -z$. However, in the next line, the author says that exchanging $y$ and $-z$ in equation one ""gives another counter example satisfying assumptions"" and shows that we cannot hav $x \equiv y$ (mod $p$). But from context, it doesn't. I take it to mean: assume $x \equiv y \not\equiv -z$, and then $-y \equiv (-y)^p = x^p+(-z)^p \equiv x-z \equiv 2y$ (leading to the same result as determined from $(1)$). So if you're assuming $x \equiv y$, for this to be satisfied, you would have to have that $z\equiv -y$ which you have literally just discounted from happening. I understand the importance of this result for the remaining proof, so essentially I would just like the above to explained a bit more clearly,to show why you could not have results (pretending they were still viable) where $x \equiv y$ (mod $p$)","['number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'field-theory']"
2380245,Show that the additive group of rational numbers does not have a Haar measure.,"I'm working on an exercise from Cohn's book Measure Theory, and I think I have a solution but I'm not sure. My issue rests on whether or not a measure defined to be infinity on every nonempty set can be a Haar measure or not - I imagine the answer is no, but I can't see why from the definition. Let $(G, +)$ be the topological group of rational numbers with addition, with the subspace topology induced from $\mathbb{R}$. Show that there does not exist a nonzero translation invariant regular Borel measure on $G$ . Let $\mu$ be a nonzero translation invariant regular Borel measure measure on $G$, and 
label $G = \{q_1, q_2, q_3, \ldots\}$. 
Then by countable additivity and translation invariance of $\mu$,
$$\mu(G) = \mu\left(\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\{q_i\}\right) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(\{q_i\}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(\{0\}).
$$
We can immediately discount the possibility that $\mu(\{0\}) = 0$, as then $\mu$ would be identically zero. So let $\mu(\{0\}) > 0$. Any open set in $G$ is a countable union of sets of the form $(a, b) \cap \mathbb{Q}$, where $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, and $a < b$. There are infinitely many rationals in any real open interval, so hence the measure of every open set in $G$ is infinity. Regularity of $\mu$ tells us that 
$$\mu(\{0\}) = \text{inf}\{\mu(U) : \{0\} \subseteq U, U \text{ is open}\} = \infty.
$$
So the measure of any nonempty subset of $G$ is infinite.
At this point I feel the proof should be done, but like I said I can't see why the infinity measure isn't a nonzero regular translation invariant Borel measure.","['harmonic-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'locally-compact-groups', 'measure-theory']"
2380251,Group Presentations and Cayley graphs,"I am trying to understand group presentations and Cayley graphs, and have a few questions I am confused about. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite $d$ -regular graph that is known to be a Cayley graph for the group $\Gamma$ and a symmetric generating set $S=\{s_1,s_2,\dots,s_d\} \subset \Gamma$ . Now it is clear that any cycle (or a closed walk) in the graph can be expressed as a word over $S$ that evaluates to the identity in the group $\Gamma$ . The converse is also true: any word over $S$ that evaluates to the identity element in $\Gamma$ can be used to construct a cycle in the graph $G$ . Let $R$ be the set of all words over $S$ that evaluate to the identity (in other words, $R$ is the set of all cycles in $G$ ). The set $R$ is closed under concatenation of words, and is a subgroup of the free group $Free(S)$ . Is it necessarily true that $$\Gamma \cong Free(S)/R$$ that is, is the quotient of the free group by the subgroup of relations formed using cycles in the Cayley graph isomorphic to the group $\Gamma$ ? Intuitively, it seems reasonable to think so. Almost obvious, (UPDATE: it is obvious!) which brings me to the main question. Suppose $G=(V,E)$ is again an $n$ -vertex $d$ -regular graph. But now we do not know if it is a Cayley graph. Choose an arbitrary orientation of each edge and  trivially use a larger label set $S=\{s_1,s_2,\dots,s_{|E|}\}$ to associate each oriented edge with a corresponding symbol, and its reverse orientation with an inverse of that symbol. That is, we associate each edge with two (oppositely) oriented (or directed) edges and associate them with a symbol $s$ and $s^{-1}$ . Now again we can consider the free group $Free(S)$ and a subgroup $R$ generated by words over $S$ that correspond to cycles in the graph. Is $R$ normal? Are there combinatorial conditions on the graph that make $R$ normal? Suppose $R$ is normal. What can we say about the group $Free(S)/R$ ? Is there any connection between the graph $G$ and the group $Free(S)/R$ ? Suppose, as before, $G$ is a Cayley graph of a group $\Gamma$ . Then is the above quotient group isomorphic to $\Gamma$ ?

2380335,"Is a regular tessellation $\{p,q\}$ always possible on some closed surface $S$?","Suppose that we are given positive integers $p$, $q$, $V$, $E$, $F$, a closed surface $S$ and the Euler characteristic $\chi(S)$ of that surface. Suppose that we also know that the following relations hold: $$
qV=2E=pF\\
V-E+F=\chi(S).\tag{$\star$}
$$
A regular tessellation $\{p,q\}$ is a tessellation by $p$-gons where $q$ tiles meet in every vertex. Or, using graph theory terms, an embedded $q$-regular graph whose dual is $p$-regular. With the information above, can we say that there is a regular tessellation $\{p,q\}$ on $S$. It is well known that if a regular tessellation $\{p,q\}$ of $S$ exists, then the relations $(\star)$ hold. So they are necessary. What I'm asking is: Are they also known to be sufficient. If the answer turns out to be highly nontrivial, then I would also like to ask for a reference. Edit 1: An idea popped into my head, to reformulate things. We start with a $q$-regualr graph with $V$ vertices and $E=\frac{qV}2$ edges. Can we then always choose a rotation system $R$, such that  we get $F=\frac{qV}p$ $p\text{-gonal}$ faces? (Remember that $p$, $q$, $V$, $E$, $F$ are given.) The questions that must be answered in this case are: Can we always draw a $q$-regular graph with $V$ vertices and $E=\frac{qV}2$ edges? Can we always give this graph a the rotation system $R$ described above? Does this make the problem any more feasible? Edit 2: As mentioned in the comments, there is an natural relation with tessellations of the hyperbolic plane and Poincaré's (polygon) Theorem. The road to walk in this case looks, to the best of my understanding, like this: Consider the $\{p,q\}$ tessellation of the hyperbolic plane ($\mathbb D$). Try to find a simply-connected subset $P$ of this tessellation consisting of $F$ $p$-gons. Say the border of $P$ consists of $Z$ sides (each side of $P$ should be an edge of a $p$-gon). Find suitable side pairing for $P$. Suitable, meaning they turn $P$ into $S$. The questions that must now be answered are: Can we always make a simply-connected $P$, consisting of  $F$ $p$-gons such that the number of vertices and edges are "" correct "". Can we then also find  suitable side pairings? This method is the least fruitful in my opinion. Notice how the two questions to be answered here are intertwined (the number of vertices and edged is dependent on the side pairings). I already found that this is a very useful heuristic method, but it probably doen't help that much to find a genral answer. I included it here to show that I've already tried it and to point out its weak spots. Edit 3: I'm starting to think that a general proof currently might not exist. So if you can show that it holds for ""a lot"" of cases, I would very much like to see that. (I am contemplating making this a conjecture, so it will  help to be able to say something about its likelihood.)","['graph-theory', 'general-topology', 'tessellations']"

In fact, I've tried something, but I think someone could come up a better idea. Here is what I did: Let $\sigma_1 \geq \ldots \sigma_n > 0$ be the singular values of $A$, so $$\|A\|_F = \sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \ldots + \sigma_n^2}$$
and
$$\|A^{-1}\|_F = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sigma_1^2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{\sigma_n^2}}.$$ By this article (equation (1)), we have the lower bound
$$\sigma_n \geq |\det A|\left( \frac{n-1}{\|A\|_F^2} \right)^\frac{n-1}{2}. $$ Therefore,
$$\|A^{-1}\|_F = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sigma_1^2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{\sigma_n^2}} \leq \sqrt{\frac{n}{\sigma_n^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sigma_n} \leq \frac{\sqrt{n}}{|\det A|} \left( \frac{\|A\|_F^2}{n-1} \right)^\frac{n-1}{2}.$$ But now I have the problem of bounding the determinant... EDIT: I'm accepting lower bounds to the determinant and lowest singular value of $A$ as answers. The bound may be large, as long as it is directly accessible from the entries or the norm of $A$.

2380427,Smoothness of $\frac12[W_0(x)+W_{-1}(x)]$ for real $x<0$,"The Lambert W-function, i.e. the multivalued inverse of $z=we^w$, has countably many complex-valued branches $W_k(z)$. The relations between the branches are a bit involved and are summarized here . 
We will consider the behavior of the $k=0,-1$ branches for $x<0$. Using Mathematica, we obtain the following plots of $W_k(x)$ along the negative real axis: Setting aside the green line for the moment, the two plots give the real and imaginary parts respectively of $W_0(x)$ (blue) and $W_{-1}(x)$ (orange). From this, we see that both branches are real for $x\in (-1/e,0)$. (The $k=0$ branch is additionally real for positive real $x$; no other branches obtain real values along the real line.) This is not surprising, as these branches correspond to the two real-valued inverses of $z=we^w$ along the real line. What's perhaps surprising, though, is that (according to this plot) $\overline{W_{-1}(x)}=W_{0}(x)$ for all $x\in (-\infty,-1/e)$. (A derivation of this fact may be found in the Q&A linked in the comments below.) From this, we conclude that the average of these two branches, $\frac{1}{2}(W_0(x)+W{-1}(x))$, is real for all negative real $x$. This is the green line plotted above, and from the first plot we further ascertain that $\frac12 (W_0+W_{-1})$ is smooth across the point $x=-1/e$. (Further plotting in Mathematica suggests that $\frac12 (W_0+W_{-1})$ is analytic for all $x\neq 0$ such that $-\pi < \text{arg }x \leq \pi$.) for all $x<0$ but not holomorphic across the real line.) By contrast, the two branches have square-root branching at $x=-1/e$. This last property of $\frac{1}{2}(W_0+W_{-1})$ remains mysterious to me, so my question is: Why is $\frac{1}{2}(W_0(x)+W{-1}(x))$ a smooth function for all real $x<0$?","['lambert-w', 'calculus', 'complex-analysis', 'analyticity', 'branch-cuts']"
2380437,$K$ is a splitting field $\iff$ any irreducible polynomial with a root in $K$ splits completely over $K$.,"Let $K/F$ be a finite extension. I want to show that $K$ is a splitting field over $F$ $\iff$ any irreducible polynomial $p(x)\in F[x]$ that has a root in $K$ splits completely over $K$. I haven't even been able to show this in a single direction. My efforts have been to show that if $K$ is the splitting field for some set of polynomials $\{f_1,\ldots,f_r\}\subset F[x]$, than any irreducible polynomial $p(x)\in F[x]$ that has a root in $K$ must split completely. Let $p(\alpha)=0$ with $\alpha\in K$. Then we can factor $p(x)$ over $K$: $p(x)=(x-\alpha)p'(x)$. From here I am actually stuck. It seems showing $p'(x)$ must have a root in $K$ would be useful but isn't really sufficient to show that it splits completely. My progress on that front is as follows. Letting $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ be roots of some irreducible (over $F$) factor of one of the $f_i$, we have an automorphism $\phi$ of $K$ obtained by extending the isomorphism $F(\beta_1)\to F(\beta_2)$ to $K$, which in turn extends the identity map on $F$. This fixes $F$ so fixes $p(x)$. Then we have $\phi((x-\alpha)p'(x))=(x-\phi(\alpha))\phi(p'(x))=p(x)$. Thus, if $\phi(\alpha)\neq\alpha$, then we have a new root for $p(x)$ over $K$. But I don't see why one of these automorphisms necessarily doesn't fix $\alpha$, or how we can show $p(x)$ necessarily splits completely this way. The book (Dummit and Foote) asks this question before introducing any Galois theory, so I would like to solve it without any of those tools. Thank you.","['abstract-algebra', 'extension-field', 'field-theory']"

2380458,An odd (potential) primality test,"My friend and I were talking about primality testing, and he showed me a really neat way to test if something is prime or not. The thing is, we have no idea how it works. So, we want to test if $n$ is prime. Draw an $n$-gon. Start at any vertex, and draw a line from that point to the adjacent vertex (this can be any direction as long as it's consistent through the whole process). Then go from that vertex, and go over two vertices. Start there and go over 3 vertices, etc. until the pattern repeats itself. 
For example, if $n$ is $5$ we draw a pentagon: • (a)

 • (e)       • (b)


  • (d)     • (c) And A->B, then B->D, then, D->B, then B->A, and finally A->A (you don't have to draw anything). The sequence then repeats itself infinitely so we stop there. What we've found is that for any $n$-gon where $n$ is prime (and only when $n$ is prime), no vertices have more than one line drawn to them . Intuitively I have some idea of why this means it's prime, but I can't exactly grasp it. Pictures: Why does this work? Does it even work past a certain number? What's the mathematical principle behind it, and can we represent this test mathematically without drawing shapes?","['algebra-precalculus', 'primality-test', 'prime-numbers', 'geometry']"
2380486,descriptive statistics as generative models,"It is common to distinguish between descriptive and inferential statistics. However, it seems to me that any descriptive statistic can be immediately used to generate realizations of the data. In the simplest (often uncomputable) case this can be done through uniform sampling of all possible data samples which exactly match the value of the statistic. Such a simple approach, while reminiscent of Monte Carlo simulations or maximum-entropy models, actually has no parameters or mechanistic specifications (at least not in an explicitly defined sense). But it seems that this above approach is still a generative model of the data -- albeit one for which it is hard, or may be impossible, to compute the likelihood. Is this correct? And if yes, does this imply that there is no fundamental distinction between descriptive and inferential statistics? Here is a simple example. Suppose I have a data sample of $m$ real numbers, such that each number is in the range of $[0, b]$, where $m$ and $b$ represent some known constraints of the system in question. I also know that the mean of my data sample is $\bar{x}$, but I don't know anything else about the distribution of these numbers. In other words, I can make no assumptions that the numbers are distributed uniformly or in any other way. I can construct a generative model which samples uniformly all sets $S=\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_m\}$, such that all $a_i \in [0, b]$ and $\frac{1}{m}\sum_{a_i \in S} a_i = \bar{x}$. This model will, by definition, match the mean of my data but may otherwise be a poor representation of its distribution. Now suppose I gradually acquire additional arbitrary descriptive statistics about my data (e.g. the first quartile, the kurtosis, or any other statistic). I can incorporate these statistics into my generative model in exactly the same way as above (i.e. through uniform sampling of all sets that match these statistics). With more descriptive statistics, my model becomes a more accurate representation of the data. Here is again my question. It seems that the descriptive statistics (and the initial constraints of the system) allow me to construct an arbitrarily precise generative model of my data without performing any inference . Is this correct? And if yes, does this imply that there is no fundamental distinction between descriptive and inferential statistics? Any pointers to the relevant literature would also be greatly appreciated.","['statistical-inference', 'probability-distributions', 'statistics', 'probability', 'descriptive-statistics']"
2380499,Show that the equation $\lambda - z - e^{-z} = 0$ has exactly one solution in the half plane.,"I know that this question has been asked before, but I'm not satisfied with the answers provided. I will post here my complete solution to this question, but I'm not very sure about my (a) and (c) parts. Let $\lambda > 1$ and show that (a) the equation $\lambda - z - e^{-z} = 0$ has exactly one solution in the half plane $\{z: \Re(z) > 0\}$. (b) Show that this solution must be real. (c) What happens to the solution as $\lambda \to 1$? Let f(z) = $\lambda - z - e^{-z}$ (a) The equation $f(z) = 0$ has exactly one solution in the half plane $\{z: \Re(z) > 0\}$. Assume that $\exists z_0 \in G = \{z:\Re(z) > 0 \}$ such that $f(z_0) = 0$, we will show that this is the only solution in $G$. $$f(z_0) = 0 \Rightarrow \lambda - z_0 = e^{-z_0} \Rightarrow |z_0 - \lambda| = e^{-\Re(z_0)}$$ But $Re(z_0) > 0$, thus $$|z_0 - \lambda| < 1$$ Consider $h(z) = -e^{-z}, g(z) = \lambda - z$, $$|h(z) + g(z)| = | \lambda - z - e^{-z} | \leq |e^{-z}| + |\lambda - z| = |h(z)| + |g(z)|$$ Hence, by Rouche's Theorem $$Z_h + P_h = Z_g + P_g$$ But $P_h = P_g = 0$. Since $g$ has only one zero in $|z - \lambda| < 1$, $h + g = f(z)$ has only one zero also. $\square$ (b) Show that the solution is real Consider the real function $$f(x) = \lambda - x - e^{-x}$$ Then $f(0) = \lambda - 1 > 0$ and $f(\lambda) = -e^{-\lambda} < 0$, thus by the Intermediate value theorem, $$\exists z_0 \in (0,\lambda), \mbox{ such that } f(z_0) = 0.$$ But this solution is unique by part (a), hence $f$ has a unique real solution in $G$.$\square$ (c) What happen to the solution $\lambda \to 1$? $$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{\lambda \to 1}f(z_0) & = \lim_{\lambda \to 1}0 \\
1 - z_0 - e^{-z_0} & = 0 \\
z_0 + e^{-z_0} = 1
\end{align*}
$$ Hence, $z_0 \to 0$ as $\lambda \to 1$. $\square$ My problem is that I can not see how we apply here the rouche theorem for make the claim about the roots of $f$ when we only consider $h$ and $g$ and not $f$.

2380532,Is there a hidden connection between RH and the golden ratio?,"I realized today that, considering the circle  $ \Gamma_{\Delta} $ on the Riemann sphere whose image through the stereographic projection is the critical line  $ \Delta $, the affixes of the images of its poles through the stereographic projection are the golden ratio and its conjugate, that are the roots of the equation $z^{2}-Sz+P$ with $S=1$ and $P=-1$. As those poles are antipodal points, the products of the affixes of the images is $-1$. The fact that their sum is $1$ means that one is the image of the other through the symmetry $s\mapsto 1-s$, which appears in the functional equation of $\zeta$. RH can be reformulated as follows: there is only one circle on the Riemann sphere whose image through stereographic projection contains all the roots of the equation $\zeta(s)=0$. Hence there should be only one pair of antipodal points corresponding to the poles of such a circle. Does this mean that the meaning of RH is that there's essentially only one possible symmetry (namely $s\mapsto 1-s$) giving rise to a functional equation allowing the analytic continuation of $\zeta$ (and other L-functions as well)?","['golden-ratio', 'stereographic-projections', 'number-theory', 'riemann-hypothesis', 'riemann-zeta']"

We have bags which are allowed to contain things where a thing is defined as either $\text{(a)}$ a marble or $\text{(b)}$ another bag. We want to consider all of the ways which we can ""bag"" the marbles. ""Bagging"" means that the ""end result"", so to speak, is having a set of ""outer"" bags $\{b_1, b_2, b_3 \cdots b_q\}$ such that each marble is contained in one of the outer bags either directly, or indirectly (e.g., a marble  may be within an inner bag which is contained in one of the $b_i$'s, and in general this ""nesting"" can be up to $n$ bags deep). We have an endless supply of bags at our disposal. This would suggest that there is an issue. We could put one marble in some bag $b_1$, and put $b_1$ in another bag $b_2$, and continue this process arbitrarily so that we have an infinite number of combinations. We don't allow this. Each bag used must directly contain at least one marble. Note that we consider the marble combinations as well. For example, if $n=2$, then one idea is to put one marble in a bag $b_1$ and having another bag $b_2$ which contains the other marble along with $b_1.$ This method counts for two baggings, since the two marbles can switch roles. The reason the marbles are ""tagged"" is to stress this point. Now, onto the problems: What is an algorithm to compute the number of all possible baggings as a function of $n$? Can it be done in polynomial time? Is there a mathematical closed form? I have tried to formalize this below (if there is a mistake in the ""formalization"", simply go by what I've written above). Formal Definition : Let $X$ be an arbitrary nonempty finite set. Suppose it has cardinality $n$. To this set, we assign a finite class of sets $B_{X}$. A member of this class is called a ""$B_{X}$ set"". This assignment is defined recursively. If $n=1$, then $X = \{x_0\}$ is a singleton set. In this case, the sole $B_{X}$ set is simply $X$. If $n > 1$, then the $B_{X}$ sets of $X$ are those sets $B$ which satisfy the following: $B \cap X \neq \varnothing$, and $B \setminus (B \cap X) = \{B({X_1}), B({X_2}) \cdots B({X_p})\}$ where $X_1, X_2 \cdots X_p$ are pairwise disjoint with $\bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq p} X_i = X \setminus (B \cap X)$ and each $B(X_i)$ is a $B_{X_i}$ set (this is the recursive part; note $|X_i| < |X|=n$). Note that $B \setminus (B \cap X) = \varnothing$ is also allowed. In particular, this implies that all nonempty subsets of $X$ are $B_{X}$ sets. It's fairly clear that the recursion terminates. A complete bagging of $X$ is a nonempty finite set $\{b_1, b_2, b_3 \cdots b_q\}$ of sets  where each $b_i$ is a $B_{Y_i}$ set with all of the $Y_i$'s being nonempty, pairwise disjoint and $\bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq q} Y_i = X$.

I've also read a bit of Willard's General Topology I'm currently studying Algebraic Topology and Differential Topology (and Differential Geometry) on my own, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it, but currently, it seems that Algebraic Topology and Differential Topology, don't use that much General Topology apart from Compactness, Connectedness and the basics.

E.g for Differential Topology if your topological space $M$ is second countable and Haursdoff, then you're good to go. While I certainly have a lot more Differential Topology and Algebraic Topology to learn  (and I look forward to it), I also feel like I should learn a bit more General Topology. The reason I've given this long explanation (because I hope it will also help others studying Topology who have similarities), is because the path most Topology students follow is the following $$\text{General Topology} \to \text{Algebraic Topology/Differential Topology}$$ in which one would usually read Topology A First Course by Munkres or a similar intro to general topology book, then follow that with something like Algebraic Topology by Hatcher and Differential Topology by Guillemin and Pollack and Milnors Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint .

2381130,Monotone class theorem and measurability of random variables,"Consider a family $f_i$, $i \in I$, of mappings of a set $\Omega$ into measurable spaces $(E_i,\mathcal{E}_i)$. We assume that for each $i \in I$ there is a subclass $\mathcal{N}_i$ of $\mathcal{E}_i$ , closed under finite intersections and such that $\sigma(\mathcal{N}_i) = \mathcal{E}_i$. Let 
$$
\mathcal{N} := \bigg\{ \bigcap_{j \in J} f_j^{-1}(A_j) \colon A_j \in \mathcal{N}_j, J \subseteq I \text{ finite}\bigg\},
$$
then by the Monotone Class Theorem we have $\sigma(\mathcal{N}) = \sigma(f_i \colon i \in I)$. $\qquad$ $(\ast)$ I don't see why $(\ast)$ is an immediate consequence of the Monotone Class Theorem , which states the following: Monotone Class Theorem. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a collection of subsets of a set $\Omega$ such that $\Omega \in \mathcal{M}$, if $A,B \in \mathcal{M}$ and $A \subseteq B$, then $B \setminus A \in \mathcal{M}$, if $\{A_n\}_{n \geq 1}$ is an increasing sequence of elements of $\mathcal{M}$, then $\bigcup_{n \geq 1} A_n \in \mathcal{M}$. If $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{M}$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under finite intersections, then $\sigma(\mathcal{F}) \subseteq \mathcal{M}$.

$$
\mathcal{G} = \bigcup_{i \in I} f_i^{-1}(\mathcal{N}_i).

At this point we only need that $\sigma(\mathcal{N}_i) = \mathcal{E}_i$ but we don't use that $\mathcal{N}_i$ is closed under finite intersections. Now we want to show $\sigma(\mathcal{N}) = \sigma(\mathcal{G})$. It is clear that $\mathcal{N} \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{G})$ and hence $\sigma(\mathcal{N}) \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{G})$. Thus it remains to show that $\mathcal{G} \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{N})$.

2381168,Understanding Lagrange multiplier,"I am trying to understand Lagrange Multiplier. I think I have grasped the theory and can follow less difficult examples but I feel I am still missing full understanding.

\nabla L(\mathbf{x},\lambda)=

\frac{\partial L(\mathbf{x},\lambda)}{\partial x_1} \\

$$ Problem . I believe gradients of Lagrangian are equal to 0 because we want to find a point(s) $\mathbf{x}_{\,0}$ for which gradients are proportional, having the same direction. I followed a couple of theory explanations and cannot figure out why we want gradients to have the same direction, why do we look for a ""point"" where gradients are proportional. If I add multiple constraints, each constraint add its own gradient, how do we find ""the point of the same gradient"" when we have multiple gradients from different constraints? Example . Also, I tried a very trivial example and I failed to understand its output. I guess it is because I don't fully understand how to apply constraints using Lagrange Multipliers. For instance: $f(x)=(x-1)(x-5)=x^2-6x+5 \\
g(x)=x-3 \\
L(x)=x^2-6x+5 - \lambda (x-3) \\
$ This is a parabola and I was looking for max value. If I don't apply constraint, max of this function is in infinity! I tried to apply a line $g(x)=x-3$ as a constraint. I build the Lagrangian, calculated its derivatives and have everything equal to 0, I have following result: $\begin{cases}
\frac{\mathrm dL(x)}{\mathrm d x} = 2x-6-\lambda = 0\\
\frac{\mathrm dL(x)}{\mathrm d \lambda} = x-3 = 0\\
\end{cases}$ This is awkward because the first and the second equations are the same if I don't have lambda. Also, substituting second to the first cause $\lambda=0$. When I draw parabola and the line, I have two points of intersection. I don't know why the Lagrange Multiplier doesn't work here, giving me a point $x_0 \approx 5.5$.

2381183,Determining the geometry of an arc segment from two known points and a curvature,"Short version: How do i determine the profile of arc segment from two known points and curvature of the arc? Long version: As an intro into modelling co-rotating twin-screw extruders i am trying to learn how the profiles of the screws are determined. For those of you who don't know, twin-screw extruders are machines which have two screws intermeshed in such a way that the action of a flight of one screw wipes the root of the other screw alternately. The below image shows the intermeshing of the screw (left) and the self-wiping action in a frontview perspective (right): For this self-wiping action, the screw needs a special geometry determined by a special set of rules. In the analysis i am following The geometry of self-cleaning twin-screw extruders by C. Rauwendaal.
The basic geometric properties of the barrel: where $\alpha_i$ is the intermesh angle, $I_h$ is the intermesh height, $C_l$ is the centerline distance and finally $D$ and $D_r$ are the screw and root diameter respectively. For a given screw diameter $D$, these are related through some geometric considerations:
$$\frac{C_l}{D}=\cos\left(\frac{\alpha_i}{2}\right) \qquad
\frac{I_h}{D} = \frac{1}{2}\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\alpha_i\right) \qquad
\frac{D_r}{D} = 2\frac{C_l}{D}-1$$
which basically implies that chosing an intermesh angle $\alpha_i$ fixes the centerline distance $C_l$, the intermesh height $I_h$ and the root diameter $D_r$. Due to symmetry only a quarter of a screw needs to be examined. Such a quarter is further divisible into three sections: the tip -> $0<\alpha\leq\alpha_t/2$, the flank -> $\alpha_t/2<\alpha\leq\alpha_t/2+\alpha_f$ the root -> $\alpha_t/2+\alpha_f<\alpha\leq\alpha_t/2+\alpha_f+\alpha_r/2$ where $\alpha$ is the angle from the horizontal, $\alpha_t$ is the tip angle, $\alpha_f$ is the flank angle, $\alpha_r$ is the root angle. As the two screws have the same cross-sectional shape, the root angle should equal the tip angle. Furthermore, the sum of the tip angle, root angle and flank angle should be:
$$\frac{\alpha_r}{2}+\alpha_f+\frac{\alpha_t}{2}=\frac{\pi}{2}$$
Given the assumption $\alpha_r=\alpha_t$ as discussed above, this yields for the tip angle:
$$\alpha_t=\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha_f$$ For the case of co-rotating screws, it is given that the flank angle has to be equal to the intermesh angle, i.e. $\alpha_f = \alpha_i$. From this follows then the tip angle $\alpha_t$ and the root angle $\alpha_r$. Having determined all these geometric properties, I would now like to be able to reconstruct the profile of the screw. Taking the center of the screw as the origin $O$, the root and tip of the screw are easily described as they have constant radii with respect to $O$. However, the flank area with respect to $O$ has a variable radius which ranges from $\frac{D_r}{2}$ at the root angle to $\frac{D}{2}$ at the tip angle. In other words: $$r = \begin{cases}
\frac{D}{2} & 0\leq\alpha<\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}\\
R\left(\alpha\right) & \frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}\leq\alpha<\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}+\alpha_{f}\\
\frac{D_{r}}{2} & \frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}+\alpha_{f}\leq\alpha<\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{t}+\alpha_{f}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{r}
\end{cases}$$ However, in the article it is given that the shape of the flank is determined by an arc of a circle (with a different unknown origin $C$) with radius $C_l$. What i would like to know is how I can determine the profile described by $R\left(\alpha\right)$ which is basically an arc segment between two points (i.e. $[r,\alpha]=[D/2, \alpha_t/2]$ and $[r,\alpha]=[D_r/2, \alpha_t/2+\alpha_f]$) with known curvature (radius $C_l$)? Update: The answer of @ja27 gives a good and easy geometric method of constructing the arc in question: However, as stated in the question (although maybe not clearly enough), I would like to be to describe the arc segment in terms of origin $O$ and angle $\alpha$ through function $R(\alpha)$, rather than origin $C$ and angle $\theta$.","['polar-coordinates', 'geometry']"
2381190,Differentiating the binomial theorem,"The standard identity 
$$
n2^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^n k\binom{n}{k}

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x+1)^n = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}x^k\right)
$$
and then substitute $x=1$ to get the same identity.  We can think of this as differentiating moving between counting sets and counting ""pointed"" sets, which is what we did above without the analytic machinery.  This is a specific instance of a fact about generating functions. If instead we look at 
$$
\frac{d^n}{dx^n}(e^x - 1) = \frac{d^n}{dx^n}\left(
  \sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}(-1)^{n-k}e^{kx}

2381260,"An insight on Riemannian Metrics, Force Fields and things related","Consider the half-plane $H^2 = \{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2\ |\ y>0\}$, and suppose it models (using a little bit of fantasy, and being highly non-rigorous as far as the actual thing goes) the underground of the Earth, such that each layer of ground $y=\textrm{k}$ consists of harder material the more one nears the final layer $y=0$.
This way, the deeper one goes the harder would it be for them to move, and hence it would be more expensive to drill the ground. I suppose such a situation could be modelled (to an extent) through the well-known representation of the hyperbolic plane $(H^2,g_{H^2})$, where
$$
g_{H^2}(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}1/y^2 &0\\0 &1/y^2\end{bmatrix}
$$
does not represent the metric which induces the proper length (for which we use the standard euclidean metric), but rather a ""cost-length"", such in a way that geodesics are the cost-minimising paths. This way, if one wishes to move from one point towards another, they could choose between a shorter but more expensive path (the line, which would be the standard geodesic of the plane) and a longer but ""cheaper"" path (geodesics of the hyperbolic plane). First off, I am interested in knowing whether reasonings like the above have been used to describe (even with an high degree of approximation) some real situation or phenomenon. If they have been, can you give me a reference? Secondly, my example relies heavily on the fact that one has got this idea of  difficulty of movement (which could be as well easiness of movement, if one has got a different metric), that in some way resembles some sort of friction. Is there so at least one vector field (maybe a force field dependent on velocity) which describes this? Something like a friction, which grows larger the more one nears the bottom? And viceversa, given some ""friction"", can one always find a geometry which models the situation? If there is no vector field, what is there that can be useful to describe what happens? I thought that, given the Levi-Civita connections of $(H^2,g_{\mathbb{R}^2})$ and $(H^2,g_{H^2})$ ($\nabla^{\mathbb{R}^2}$ and $\nabla^{H^2}$) and a path $c(t)$ in $H^2$, what I called ""friction"" could be
$$\tilde{\nabla}_{c'(t)}c'(t) := 2\nabla^{\mathbb{R}^2}_{c'(t)}c'(t) - \nabla^{H^2}_{c'(t)}c'(t),$$
and $\tilde{\nabla}$ is a torsion-free connection. However, I have yet to find the proprieties of such connection and in which way it is related to the original situation. I would think (wild guess) that, if one can find a metric such that $\tilde{\nabla}$ is its Levi-Civita connection, then the geodesics would be those paths along which there is the best ""bargain"" between length and cost.","['vector-fields', 'riemannian-geometry', 'reference-request', 'mathematical-physics', 'differential-geometry']"

Proof : Suppose there is an algorithm, call it CheckHalt, such that if an algorithm X and a data set D are input, then CheckHalt prints ""halts"" if X terminates in a finite number of steps when run with the data set D or ""loops forever"" if X does notterminate in a finite number of steps when run with data set D.

It tells whether if we run the algorithm X with that data set D as it's (X's) input, then X will halt or loop forever. Thus CheckHalt(X,D) seems good.

We seek a matrix $$\begin{pmatrix}\alpha & \beta \\ \gamma & \delta \end{pmatrix}$$ with $\alpha\delta - \beta\gamma \ne 0$ such that 
$$\frac{1}{\alpha\delta - \beta\gamma} \begin{pmatrix} \delta & -\beta \\ -\gamma & \alpha \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}\alpha & \beta \\ \gamma & \delta \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}* & 0 \\ 0 & *\end{pmatrix}.$$
Grinding through the algebra, it turns out that the off-diagonal terms are $Q(\alpha, \gamma)$ and $-Q(\beta, \delta)$, up to a scalar multiple, where $$Q(x, y) = cx^2 + (a-d)xy - by^2.$$
So to find a diagonalizing matrix, we seek solutions to $Q(x, y) = 0$.
Because $Q$ is homogeneous, we are actually seeking solutions in $\mathbb{P}^1$. The condition $\alpha\delta - \beta\gamma \ne 0$ is equivalent to $$[\alpha:\gamma] \ne [\beta:\delta].$$
This viewpoint is totally new to me. For $n$-by-$n$ matrices, are there analogous homogeneous forms coming from trying to diagonalize in this way?","['matrices', 'projective-space', 'linear-algebra']"

However, these proofs tend to rely on principles of the form ""every 'small' union of 'small' sets is 'small',"" and these can fail quite badly without choice . Conversely, at the other end of things, if we extend ZF by a strong anti -choice principle, we can often get provably non-first-countable spaces. For example, the cofinite topology on an amorphous set $A$ is non-first-countable. Why? Pick $a\in A$, and consider a sequence $(U_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ of neighborhoods of $a$. The union of the complements of the $U_i$s must not be finite in order for the sequence to witness first countability. Let $V_i$ be the set of points ""thrown out for the first time"" at stage $i$: that is, $V_i$ is the set of $y$ such that $y\not\in U_i$ but $y\in \bigcup_{j<i} U_j$. Infinitely many of the $V_i$s must be nonempty; WLOG suppose each $V_i$ is nonempty. But then $\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{N}}V_{2i}$ and $\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{N}}V_{2i+1}$ are two disjoint infinite subsets of $A$. So my question is whether we can find non-first-countable spaces in ZF alone. Phrased most simply, this is: Does ZF prove that there are non-first-countable spaces? We can also ask a question which might be a bit more satisfying: Is there a formula $\varphi$ which ZF proves defines a non-first-countable topological space?

Under these conditions, how would one prove that the following function $f: G\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined by $$g\mapsto \int_X e^{-c\rho(x)-c\rho(g^{-1}x)}\,dx,$$ is in $L^1(G)$ for $c\in\mathbb{R}$ sufficiently large? I'm not sure how to use the constraint on the volume growth of balls, so it would be very helpful if someone could write a fairly detailed calculation showing how this is done.

2381637,Special Kahler structure of a Lagrangian submanifold,"I'm trying to understand a part of N.J.Hitchin's paper ""The moduli space of complex Lagrangian submanifolds"" https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9901069.pdf . In particular I would like to understand how any given holomorphic function $\mathcal{F}$ will naturally give a special Kahler manifold. In the following I will try my best to summarize his Remark 1 (page 11). Let $V$ be a real symplectic vector space with coordinates $\{x_1,...,x_{2n}\}$ and a symplectic form $\omega = \sum_{i = 1}^n dx_{i} \wedge dx_{n+i}$. Consider $V \times V$, let's denote a coordinates on the second factor by $\{\xi_1,...,\xi_{2n}\}$ then we introduce a complex structure $I$ on $V\times V$ by 
\begin{equation}
I\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi_{n+i}}, \qquad I\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi_i} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{n+i}}.
\end{equation}
So we can define a holomorphic complex coordinates $\{v_i = x_i + i\xi_{n+i}, w_i = \xi_i + ix_{n+i}|i = 1,...,n\}$ and the canonical complex symplectic form $\omega^c = \sum_{i = 1}^n dv_i \wedge dw_i = \omega_1 + i\omega_2$ where
\begin{equation}
\omega_1 = \sum_{i = 1}^{2n}dx_i\wedge d\xi_i, \qquad \omega_2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (dx_i \wedge dx_{n+i} - d\xi_i \wedge d\xi_{n+i}).
\end{equation} The claim is that given any holomorphic function $\mathcal{F} =
\mathcal{F}(w_1,...,w_n)$ a complex Lagrangian submanifold $M = \{z_i =
\partial\mathcal{F}/\partial w_i\} \subset V\times V$ is special
  Kahler with complex structure $I|_M$. According to the paper this follows since $\omega^c|_M = 0 \implies \omega_i|_M = 0, i = 1,2$ hence $M$ is bi-Lagrangian, then ""From Theorem 2 this is all we need for a special Kahler manifold"" (page 12). I'm having a difficult time understanding this because Theorem 2 (page 7) also required that $M\subset V\times V$ is transversal to two projections onto $V$ in addition to the bi-Lagrangian condition. I interpreted the transversal condition as the two projections of $M$ are surjective to $V$, which seems to be quite an important part in proving Theorem 2. However I don't see why
\begin{equation} 
M = \Big\{v_i = \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial w_i}\Big\} = \Big\{x_i = \frac{\partial \Re \mathcal{F}}{\partial \xi_i} = \frac{\partial \Im \mathcal{F}}{\partial x_{n+i}},\ \xi_{n+i} = \frac{\partial \Im \mathcal{F}}{\partial \xi_i} = -\frac{\partial \Re \mathcal{F}}{\partial x_{n+i}}\Big\}
\end{equation}
would satisfies such condition for an arbitrary $\mathcal{F}$. For example I could take $\mathcal{F} = 0$ then obviously $x_i$ and $\xi_{n+i}$ would be fixed and transversality condition would failed. Question : what exactly did I miss in trying to follow his arguments above? Or, if not every holomorphic functions $\mathcal{F}$ would yield a special Kahler Lagrangian then what is a criterion to determine which $\mathcal{F}$ would works?

If its maximum occurs at $\infty$, then we are done, since then it will be approaching its maximum, a finite number. But if it attains its maximum on the ""$x$-axis"", we might not be able to say as much.

2381948,"How to characterize the category Group, and define exactness therein?","I am currently trying to come up with a definition of an exact sequence of groups which uses only category theoretic definitions. That is I am trying to come up with a list of criteria for an arbitrary category which is sufficient to construct exact sequences and prove their properties and which is satisfied by the category group. Obviously one can develop exact sequences in an abelian category but Group is not abelian. I observe that Group has all kernels and cokernels, all equalizers and coequalizers, a zero object, and all epimorphisms are cokernels. I am trying to use only these hypotheses to define exact sequences and derive their properties but I am stuck. I can define $\textrm{im }f = \ker(\textrm{coker }f)$ and $\textrm{coim }f = \textrm{coker }(\ker f)$. Since all epimorphisms are cokernels $\textrm{coker }(\ker f)$ satisfies the definition of the coimage given by wikipedia. Further, the coimage produces an epic-monic factorization of $f$ because Group contains all coequalizers (this argument is from $\textit{Categories for the Working Mathematician}$ pg 193). The problem is that because Group is not normal, I cannot show that $\textrm{im }f = \ker(\textrm{coker }f)$ satisfies the universal property in the definition of the image, nor can I show that $\textrm{im }f = \textrm{coim }f$. To define exactness I say that $A \buildrel a\over\longrightarrow B \buildrel b\over\longrightarrow C$ is exact iff $\ker b = \ker(\textrm{coker }a)$ which I can show is equivalent to saying  $\textrm{coker }a = \textrm{coker }(\ker b)$. This has the benefit of not requiring equalizers, coequalizers, normality, or conormality because I am not requiring the kernel of the cokernel or the cokernel of the kernel to satisfy the definitions of the image or coimage respectively. My immediate goal is to use only my definition of exactness and the properties I have observed about Group to prove that in every short exact sequence, $$0 \longrightarrow A \buildrel a\over\longrightarrow B \buildrel b\over\longrightarrow C \longrightarrow 0$$  $a$ is monic and $b$ is epic. I have proven that $a$ is monic: Group is conormal with all coequalizers so $\textrm{coker }(\ker a) = \textrm{coim }a$ and yields an epic-monic factorization of $a$. Further, $\textrm{coker }0 = 1_A = \textrm{coker }(\ker a)$ by my definition of exactness so $a$ factors through $1_B$-monic and thus $a$ is monic. I am stuck at proving $b$ is epic. If I could show $\ker(\textrm{coker }a) = \textrm{coker }(\ker a) = \textrm{coim }a$ then I could dualize my previous argument and use the dual definition of exactness (ker = ker coker) to get the result. However I don't see how to establish this equality using the existence of equalizers, coequalizers, and conormality. I observe that any monomorphism can be factored through a normal monomorphism (since any subgroup is included in its normal closure) and that this factoring has a universal property by the minimality of the normal closure, but I can't quite see how to incorporate this into Mac Lane's argument fruitfully.

Hints will be appreciated (if there is a site for counterexamples I will be glad).","['derivatives', 'limits', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'convergence-divergence']"
2382204,Probability of truth in a chain of statements,"Three individuals $A$ , $B$ and $C$ tell the truth with probability $1/3$ . (A) $C$ makes a statement and $A$ claims that it is true. What is the probability that the statement is true. (B) $C$ makes a statement and $A$ tells you that $B$ claims the statement is true. What is the probability that the statement is true. Let $T_A$ be the event that $A$ tells the truth and similarly $T_B \ \& \ T_C$ My answer in the first case $\frac{1}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}$ . I am confused with part $B$ of the question. My reasoning: Probability of $C$ telling the truth is $1/3$ . Now we don't know what $B$ said so we assume two cases. Therefore we would have the probability as $P(T_A \ T_B \ T_C \cup T_A \ T_B^C \ T_C^C) = \frac{1}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}\cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3}$ . Is this correct? This problem appears as an exercise to Bayes theorem so I am confused as to how the theorem is applicable. Thanks in advance for any assistance.",['probability']
2382209,Diagonalisable commuting endomorphisms on infinite dimensional space,"It is well-know that for $V$ a complex finite dimensional vector space and $\{h_i\}$ a family of diagonalisable commuting endomorphisms then there is a basis for $V$ of common eigenvectors. This is because in the weight decomposition $V = \oplus V_\lambda$, the subspaces are $h_k$ invariant and then they are diagonalisable there, and we can decompose each of the $V_\lambda$ into weight spaces and so on, the process will finish eventually in case we have an infinite set of endomorphism, but this might not be true if $V$ is infinite dimensional. Is there an easy counter-example where the $\{h_i\}$ are commuting diagonalisable but there is no basis of common eigenvectors?","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'linear-algebra', 'analysis']"
2382210,$a_{n+1} = \cos(a_n)$ with $a_1 = x$,Let  $(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence defined by $a_1=x$  and $  a_{n+1}=\cos(a_n)$ then check the  the convergence of sequence . Here what Approached is like $-1\leq \cos x \leq +1$ so we get $a_2 = cos(\mathbb{I_1})$ in general $a_{n+1} = cos(\mathbb{I_n})$ and cos being an even function $\mathbb{I_2}$ onwards  it will contain elements $0 \leq x\leq c  $ and  $c<1$  hence it converges to $cos (0)=1$ It that a fair argument,"['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence']"

2382224,Maximize linear function over disk of radius $2$,"Maximize $f(x, y) = x + 2y$ with constraint $x^2 + y^2 \le 4$. $f(x, y)$ has no CP's so thats something gone. I considered the boundary/edge of $g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$. And I got the point $(0, 2), (2, 0)$, which gave $f(0, 2) = f(2, 0) = 4$. However, the point $(2/\sqrt(5), 4/\sqrt(5))$ gives a larger max. How do I approach this to get this point?","['optimization', 'calculus', 'multivariable-calculus', 'quadratic-programming', 'non-convex-optimization']"
2382235,Find minimum value that the trigonometric expression may take,"For $x\in\left(0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)$  find a minimal value, which the  expression $$\sec x+\csc x+\sec^{2}x+\csc^{2}x$$ can take. My attempt: I followed the trigonometrical approach and obtained $$\sec x+\csc x+\sec^{2}x+\csc^{2}x=\sqrt{\left(2\csc 2x+1\right)^2-1}+4\csc^{2}2x\geq \sqrt{(2+1)^2-1}+4(1)=4+2\sqrt{2}$$ Above was obtained after lot of manipulations with the trigonometrical identities so I am looking for an easy approach to this problem.","['maxima-minima', 'inequality', 'trigonometry']"
