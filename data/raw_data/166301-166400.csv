2897404,Interchange of a limit and integral,How would one show the following equality?

2897434,"We are given an $18\times 18$ table, all of whose cells may be black or white.","We are given an $18\times 18$ table, all
of whose cells may be black or white. Initially all the cells are
colored white. We may perform the following operation: choose one
column or one row and change the color of all cells in this column
or row. Is it possible by repeating the operation to obtain a
table with exactly $16$ black cells? Now I wonder if a following solution is correct? All the matrix here are $18\times 18$ . Let $S$ be a matrix with all entry $1$ and $F$ be a matrix with exactly $16$ entries with $0$ and the other entries are $1$ . Let $A_i$ be a matrix with all entries $1$ on $i$ -th row, for $1\leq
i\leq 18$ and the other are 0 and with all entries $1$ on $(i-18)$ -th column for $19\leq i\leq 36$ and the other are zero.
So, for example: $$A_2 =\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & \dots & 0&0\\
1&1&\dots &1&1\\
0 & 0 & \dots & 0&0\\
\vdots & \vdots & \dots & \vdots &\vdots\\
0 & 0 & \dots & 0&0
\end{bmatrix}
\;\;\;{\rm and}\;\;\; A_{19} =\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & \dots & 0&0\\
1&0&\dots &0&0\\
1 & 0 & \dots & 0&0\\
\vdots & \vdots & \dots & \vdots &\vdots\\
1 & 0 & \dots & 0&0
\end{bmatrix}
$$ We can understand a table as a matrix with entry $1$ if
corresponding cell is white and $0$ if it is black. So $S$ is a
starting matrix and $F$ a final matrix. Now each recoloring of a
given matrix $M$ is actually $M+A_i$ for some $i\leq 36$ So after some transformations we have equality like this $$F = S +
a_1A_1+a_2A_2+...+a_{36}A_{36}$$ where $a_i\in \{ 0,1\}$ for all $i$ . Mark $F-S = D$ , so $D$ is a matrix with exactly $16$ ones. Now what can we say about $a_1,a_2,...$ ? Since $D$ has exactly $16$ ones it must have at least two columns and two rows with only
zeros. We can assume that all entries in first $2$ rows and first $2$ columns are $0$ , so $D$ is like: $$ D =\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0&\dots & 0&0\\
0 & 0 &0 &\dots &0&0\\
0 & 0 & *& \dots & *&*\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \dots &\vdots& \vdots\\
0 & 0 & *&\dots & *&*
\end{bmatrix}
$$ If $a_1=1$ then each $a_{19},a_{20},...a_{36}$ must also be $1$ since in first row must be all $0$ . But then we must have also $a_2,...,a_{18}$ all $1$ since in first column are only $0$ . This
means that $D$ is a zero matrix which is not true. So $a_1=0$ and thus
all $a_{19},a_{20},...a_{36}$ are $0$ and then also all $a_2,...,a_{18}$ are $0$ so $D$ is zero matrix again. A
contradiction. This is not a duplicate. I don't want a solution like in that link, I want a proof verification!","['algebraic-combinatorics', 'solution-verification', 'linear-algebra', 'combinatorics']"

2897478,Intuitively speaking why use geodesics to capture the idea of completeness?,"Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. We would like to define one notion of completeness which captures the idea of ""missing points"". For example $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus \{0\}$ should be incomplete in this sense. Now, in the Riemmanian case, the metrig $g$ gives rise to a distance function $d_g : M\times M\to [0,\infty)$ and $M$ is a metric space in the usual sense. This allows us to use the familiar idea of completeness of a metric space. We hence say that $(M,g)$ is $m$-complete (or metrically complete) if the metric space $(M,d_g)$ is complete in the sense that every Cauchy sequence converges. Now forget the metric space structure and focus just on the Riemmanian manifold structure. The usual thing to do is to say that $(M,g)$ is $g$-complete (or geodesically complete) if every inextendible geodesic is defined on the whole $\mathbb{R}$. The Hopf-Rinow theorem them says that $(M,g)$ is geodesically complete if and only if it is metrically complete. Anyway, the question is about geodesic completeness. What we want is to capture the idea that some point is missing. Well it is then natural to pick a curve and ask whether we can continuously extend it to the whole $\mathbb{R}$ or not. If we can't intuitively speaking there's a point missing. Take $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus \{(1,0)\}$ then the curve $(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$ with $\theta \in (0,2\pi)$ cannot be extended to $\mathbb{R}$ continuously. Indeed whatever the value we set for it at $0,2\pi$ the curve will be discontinuous there. In a sense: it was going in the direction of a missing point and to extend it, it must jump. The question is: why do we need geodesics to define this? Why can't we say: $M$ is complete if every continuous inextendible curve is defined on the whole $\mathbb{R}$. The point is that I don't get why do we need the metric structure encoded in the requirement that the definition is made with geodesics to capture the idea of missing points. What is the intuition that we need geodesics/metric structure to capture the idea that there are points missing in the manifold?","['motivation', 'definition', 'intuition', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

I know that $\sqrt[3]{x}$ are defined for any $x$ so I focus on the denominator which should not be equal to $0$, therefore $3(x-1)^{1/3}\neq0\implies x-1\neq0\implies x \neq 1$.

2897580,A conjecture about big prime numbers,"The fact that each prime number (greater than $9$) ends with one of the four digits $1,3,7,9$, allows us to classify the tens in which the primes are found according to which of these four digits, added to the tens, yields to a prime number. For example, for the first ten we have $1 \rightarrow \{1,3,7,9\}$. In fact, $10+1$, $10+3$, $10+7$ and $10+9$ are all primes. Conversely, for the twentieth ten the association reads $20 \rightarrow \{\}$, since there are no primes between $200$ and $209$. It is easy to see that each ten is associated to one (and only one) group of symbols, chosen among the following $16$ distinct alternatives: $\{\}$, $\{1\}$, $\{3\}$, $\{7\}$, $\{9\}$, $\{1,3\}$, $\{1,7\}$, $\{1,9\}$,  $\{3,7\}$, $\{3,9\}$, $\{7,9\}$, $\{1,3,7\}$, $\{1,3,9\}$, $\{1,7,9\}$, $\{3,7,9\}$, $\{1,3,7,9\}$. For the sake of simplicity, we can identify each of these $16$ distinct groups of symbols  with a single symbol, or with a single color , as illustrated below: Arranging the tens in a Pascal's triangle, we find (*) the following structure (omitting the first ten on the edges of the triangle): (*) I hope that my code is correct! It would be great if someone, more skilled than me, could confirm the emergence of such structure. In case you are interested in double-checking, please have a look to this post for details. However, assuming that I did not mess up too much with the code, my conjecture is that For very big tens, there cannot be colored squares other than on the outer diagonal of the triangle. In other words, big primes $p$ must be in the form $p=10^{\binom{n}{k}}+1$, or $p=10^{\binom{n}{k}}+3$, or $p=10^{\binom{n}{k}}+7$, or $p=10^{\binom{n}{k}}+9$, and $k=1$. Clearly, a weaker version of such conjecture is that $k$ can oscillate among some little integer $2,3,4,5\ldots$ (which ones?). This is probably an obvious result for the experts (I apologize, in case), nevertheless I would be glad to understand the connections between this approach and others, and also to know if there is some technique to attack  such problem. Sorry for possible naivety, and thank you very much for your comments and suggestions! EDIT: The conjecture was based on the assumption that the plot of the triangle was correct. But, as Ross has shown, that was not the case.

2897596,What is the difference between a massless pinor and a spinor?,"I was reading the paper ""The Pin Groups in Physics: C, P, and T"" by M. Berg, C.

In one of the sections they quickly cover the (standard) definition of $\textbf{pinors}$ as sections of a vector bundle associated to a $\mathrm{Pin}$ -bundle. As this paper is linked to quantum field theory, they consider both massless and massive pinor fields and define them as sections of vector bundels associated to $\mathrm{Pin}$ -bundles reducible to a $\mathrm{Spin}$ -bundle and $\mathrm{Pin}$ -bundles that do no admit such a reduction, respectively. On the other hand, they define a $\textbf{spinor}$ field as a section of a vector bundle associated to a $\mathrm{Spin}$ -bundle. What exactly is the difference between a massless pinor and a spinor?

Prove that if $f_n \to f$ $\mu$-almost everywhere and $\int f_n \to \int f$, then $\int |f_n - f| \to 0$. Note that $|f_n - f| \leq f_n + f$, so $g_n := f_n + f - |f_n -f| \geq 0$. Fatou gives $\int \liminf_n g_n \leq \liminf_n \int g_n$.

2897746,What is an upper bound on the minimum angle between approximately equally spaced points on a n-dimensional unit hypersphere?,"If we have a unit hypersphere, with ""approximately"" evenly spaced points$^1$, is there any good upper bound on the minimum angle between nearby points? On a unit circle, for $N$ equally spaced points, the minimum angle would be $2\pi/N$. For a unit sphere, we can use the area of a spherical cap to get us a upper bound of the angle: $$
A = \frac{4\pi}{N} = 2\pi \left(1-\cos(\theta)\right) \\
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(1 - \frac{2}{N}\right)
$$ Where $\theta$ here should be half of the angle between two neighboring points.  This is an upper bound because it assumes we are completely covering the surface with circles around each point, which we can't do.  The actual circles around each point would have to be smaller, so our angle would be smaller. But what about for a higher dimensional hypersphere? Addendum: As Ross noted, the sphere packing density comes into play in this problem, which will likely make it intractable in higher dimensions... I looked up the sphere packing densities (in Euclidean space, which is probably fine for large enough $N$) at Mathworld .  The first 8 dimensions are the only ones that are listed (and I believe known), and they fall off fairly quickly with dimension (it looks close to linear for the first 8, but it is likely exponential or similar), in 8 dimensions the packing density is roughly .25. An idea -- though it depends on getting a decent approximation for the sphere packing density in higher dimensions -- would be to use the sphere packing density to correct the area.  In 3 dimensions: $$
A = \delta_2 \frac{4\pi}{N} = \dots\\
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(1-\delta_2 \frac{2}{N}\right)
$$ where $\delta_2$ is the sphere packing density for 2 dimensions. More: These lecture notes give an lower bound of the packing density of $2n\cdot2^{-n}$, and an upper bound of

2897850,"A Question on certain Hilbert space of continuous functions, and a characteristic of convergence in it","Define $T^k(\Omega)$, $\Omega$ an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$ (with a smooth boundary), as a space of function equivalance classes, with the norm defined as $$ \|f\|_{T^k(\Omega)}^2 =     \|f\|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 + \|(\sum\limits_{i=1}^m(\frac{\partial^{k}f}{\partial x_i^{k}})^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 $$ It can be easily noted that $T^k(\Omega)$ is a Hilbert space. Also note that this norm is not a Sobolev norm, as we don't consider cross derivatives. Consider the set $$M = C^0(\bar{\Omega}) \cap T^k(\Omega)  $$ Prove that : If $k > \frac{m}{2}$, every sequence $\{f_n\},f_n \in M$, that converges in the norm $\|.\|_{T^k(\Omega)}$, also converges in the norm $\|.\|_{C^0(\bar{\Omega})}$ (and to a limit $f \in M$) Proof : Consider a sequence $f_n \in M$ and let $f_n\to f \in M$ in the norm $\|.\|_{T^k(\Omega)}$ Idea is to add a small perturbation in the form of a shrinking bump, to produce a simple discontinuity in the limit function $f$. Lets add a small bump function $\psi(n\boldsymbol{x})$ to $f_n(\boldsymbol{x})$ to form a new sequence $$\phi_n(\boldsymbol{x}) = \psi(n\boldsymbol{x}) + f_n(\boldsymbol{x}) $$ Now we show that, in doing so, we blow up the norm and spoil the convergence of the sequence.
For simplicity, assume $\psi_n(\boldsymbol{x}) = \psi(n\boldsymbol{x})$ is radially symmetric. With a change of variable $\boldsymbol{t} = n\boldsymbol{x}$  we can easily see that  $$\|f_n(\boldsymbol{x}) + \psi(n\boldsymbol{x})\|_{L^2(\Omega)} \to \|f\|_{L^2(\Omega)}$$ But when we consider the other term of the norm, again with a change of variable $\boldsymbol{t} = n\boldsymbol{x}$, we can see that $$\begin{align} \int_{\Omega} |\frac{\partial^k{\phi_n}}{\partial{x_i^k}}|^2 \mathop{}\!\mathrm{d}^m\boldsymbol{x} & = \int_{\Omega}|\frac{\partial^k{f_n}}{\partial{x_i^k}}|^2 \mathop{}\!\mathrm{d}^m\boldsymbol{x} + 2\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial^k{f_n}}{\partial{x_i^k}} \frac{\partial^k{\psi_n}}{\partial{x_i^k}}\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d}^m\boldsymbol{x} +  \int_{\Omega}|\frac{\partial^k{\psi_n}}{\partial{x_i^k}}|^2 \mathop{}\!\mathrm{d}^m\boldsymbol{x} \\\\ & = \|\frac{\partial^k{f_n}}{\partial{t_i^k}}\|_{L^2}^2 + O(n^{(k-m)}\|\frac{\partial^k{f_n}}{\partial{t_i^k}}\|_{L^2} \|\frac{\partial^k{\psi}}{\partial{t_i^k}}\|_{L^2}) +  n^{(2k-m)}\|\frac{\partial^k{\psi}}{\partial{t_i^k}}\|_{L^2}^2\end{align} $$ The last term blows up, when $k > \frac{m}{2}$. So one cannot produce a discontinuity by way of adding a shrinking bump. Hence all sequences in $M$ that converge in the norm $\|.\|_{T^k(\Omega)}$ also converge in the norm $\|.\|_{C^0(\bar{\Omega})}$ Other cases : For a jump discontinuity, we let the bump have a flatter region and we shrink only the transition region. Same logic applies here. For a blow up situation, consider $\phi_n(\boldsymbol{x}) = g(n)\psi(n\boldsymbol{x})$, where $g(n) = \omega(1)$ ( Bachmann–Landau notations ), which means $g(n)$ grows faster than 1, or $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}g(n) = \infty$. In this case, one can see that the last term in the RHS of the last equation in my proof, blows up when $k\ge\frac{m}{2}$. Hence blow up discontinuity is also ruled out in case of $k>\frac{m}{2}$. Case of Oscillatory discontinuity remains: For oscillatory case consider $\phi_n(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sin(n\boldsymbol{x})\psi_(n\boldsymbol{x})$ Question : Is the above proof complete?(if at all it makes sense) Is there any simpler proof with a direct application of a well known theorem? Similar references appreciated. For $\Omega = [0,1)^m$, with periodic boundary conditions, this norm is equivalent to Sobolev norm, hence by general Sobolev inequality, the result follows.

2898020,A cornucopia of confusion on limits?,"I am having a lot of confusion in my multivariable calculus lectures. We usually see that we can try to approach a certain limit with paths and if two paths yield different ""limits"", then the limit does not exist. But finding ""limits"" via any number of different paths does not guarantee the limit exist, in previous lectures, it was not clear if polar coordinates were a considered a kind of path, but the professor didn't say it wasn't. It was said that only the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition actually guarantees the limit exist. In a local calculus book, I found the following theorem (which was also presented in previous calculus lectures): If $\displaystyle \lim_{(x,y)\to {(x_0,y_0)}}f(x,y)=0$ and $|g(x,y)|\leq M$ for $0<|(x,y)-(x_0,y_0)|<r$ with $r>0, M>0$ fixed real numbers, then: $$\lim_{(x,y)\to {(x_0,y_0)}}f(x,y)g(x,y)=0$$ I tried to use it in the following two cases: $$\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} \frac{xy}{\sqrt{x² + y²}} $$ Here we see that: $$\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} \frac{xy}{\sqrt{x² + y²}} = x \frac{y}{\sqrt{x² + y²}} $$ And it's easy to see that $\frac{y}{\sqrt{x² + y²}}$ is bounded and we can use the previous thorem, also Wolfram Alpha asserts it exists. $$\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} x \sin \left( \frac{1}{x²+y²} \right)$$ Now, it seems a lot that $\left |\sin \left( \frac{1}{x²+y²} \right)\right|\leq 1$ and that we can apply our theorem, but Wolfram Alpha says the limit does not exist. Now, as I said before, it was said that approaching via any number of paths does not prove that a limit indeed exists and it was not clear wheather the approach via polar coordinates is considered a ""path"" (although, to me, it looks like something very diferent than the paths $y=mx$ , for example), now there is a new professor who gave us a list of exercises with the following proposition: Given $f: D \subset \Bbb{R}² \to \Bbb{R}$ , then $$\lim_{(x,y)\to0 } f(x,y)=L \iff \lim_{r\to0} f(r\cos \theta,r \sin \theta)=L$$ uniformly in $\theta$ .
That is, the limit exists iff the radial limit of $f$ does not depend on $\theta$ . But what is ""uniformly""? What is ""does not depend""?
I have tried to use it on the second example, it gives me: $$\lim_{r\to 0} r \cos \theta \sin\left(\frac{1}{r²}\right) $$ And then I assumed that ""does not depends"" means that no part of the formula contains $\theta$ . But upon inspecting my first example, it gives me: $$\lim_{r\to 0} r\cos \theta \sin \theta $$ If I assume this meaning for ""does not depend"", then this limit does not exist, but the other theorem asserts it does and I have also verified on Wolfram Alpha. I have talked with this professor, she said me that the theorem on radial limits is true and that she saw it in a book (I never saw it anywhere), I asked her the title of the book and am still waiting a response, she also said that the polar coordinates are not really a ""path"". From this, I have these questions: Is the first theorem actually a theorem? Is the second theorem actually a theorem? Where can I find a proof of it? I googled a bit something like ""polar coordinate limits"" and ""radial limits"" but didn't find anything that seemed relevant. I am asking if it is true because if it is, I still can't prove it. If the first theorem is true, then where am I making any mistake? I suspect I may be misreading the condition of the distance bounded by $r$ . What is the meaning of ""depend"" and ""uniformly""? I have noticed the following possibility (may be wrong): $$\lim_{r\to 0} r \cos \theta \sin\left(\frac{1}{r²}\right) =\cos \theta \lim_{r\to 0} r  \sin\left(\frac{1}{r²}\right) $$ and I know that $$\lim_{r\to 0} r  \sin\left(\frac{1}{r²}\right)=0$$ and $|\cos x| \leq 1$ , so what could possibly go wrong if we take a different $\theta$ ? It really seems that a change in $\theta$ won't change the limit.","['limits', 'multivariable-calculus', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

If $E$ is some linear equation, we'll say that $E$ is a logical consequence of $S$ if whenever a vector satisfies $S$, it satisfies $E$. Now, in a first course in linear algebra we're taught one simple way to prove that an equation $E$ is a logical consequence of $S$: express it as a linear combination of equations in $S$. But notice that in theory, there could be equations $E$ which are logical consequences of $S$, and yet are not linear combinations of equations in $S$: maybe linear consequence is a strictly stronger notion that mere logical consequence . Well, it turns out this isn't the case . Taking linear combinations is a sufficiently powerful technique to derive all equations which follow from $S$. Now, this definitely feels like a kind of logical completeness result. We could say that we have the following axioms: the equations of $S$, and the axiom that if two equations are true, any linear combination of them is true.

I have stated three questions but I felt that they are so related that they fit within a single post. Context. After reading Hatcher's Algebraic Topology I wanted to learn more about homotopy theory and in particular about spectra. I soon found the $n$Lab's Introduction to Stable Homotopy Theory which I'm reading right now. Let me crudely summarize what I've come across. We start with the desire to find a category of topological spaces which behaves decently from a category-theoretic viewpoint. The category that we end up finding is the category $\mathbf{Top}^*_{\mathrm{cgwh}}$ of pointed compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces. The definition is somewhat ad hoc , and there are many other choices besides $\mathbf{Top}^*_{\mathrm{cgwh}}$. This does not concern us. We want to endow this with a model structure. We construct the Quillen--Serre structure. It's a rather convoluted struction, and it's not at all the only model structure. Neither of these observations bother us. Once we've set this up, we want to consider the category obtained by stabilizing the Quillen adjunction $\Sigma \dashv \Omega$ on $\mathbf{Top}^*_{\mathrm{cgwh}}$, called the stable homotopy category. We end up looking for models of this category, thus arriving at the category of sequential spectra endowed with the stable model structure. The definitions are more convoluted than ever. Still, this leaves us unmoved. For some reason the failure of a decent smash product on the category of sequential spectra disappoints us and we end up going even further by considering more highly structured models with yet more complicated definitions and constructions. They go entirely beyond me. Questions. In all, I am very surprised by what I've read. It has left me with a few general open-ended questions. Spectra seemed nice to me because they represent cohomology theories. As such I expected stuff about cohomology. But the emphasis on the notes lies pretty much entirely on finding nice categories. Why do we want them so badly? While Hatcher's Algebraic Topology was mostly concerned with investigating spaces, the notes seem to only care for the spaces as being models for the categories we crave for. Does this trend continue as one delves deeper into this subject? If the role of spaces has been reduced to models for certain categories, then why do we not think of letting go of them altogether? I mean, let's be real. The journey from your friendly $\mathbf{Top}$ to the daunting $(\mathbf{Top}^*_{\mathrm{cgwh}})_{\rm{Quillen}}$ to the utterly monstrous $\mathrm{SeqSpec}(\mathbf{Top}_{\mathrm{cgwh}})_{\mathrm{stable}}$ (and yet beyond), is to me a horribly unnatural one. It makes me feel that there should be a more royal road to whatever holy grail of categories we are praying for. So are topological spaces even the right framework in the first place?

Also when $\mathbb{I}(|\vec{M}_i - \vec{p}|_2<d)$ is true 1 is returned, otherwise its zero. If I had two different matrices and plugged them into this function, how would I find the $n$ dimensional points where the two functions are equal to each other? As simple example let us look at the matrices $A$ and $B$:
$$A =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0.3 & 0.3 \\
    0.3 & 0.4  \\
    0.4 & 0.3 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
B =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0.6 & 0.6 \\
    0.6 & 0.7  \\
    0.7 & 0.6 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
$$
And the minimum distance is:
$$
d=0.3
$$ How would one go about finding the set of points where $f(A, p) = f(B, p)$?
I know you would make them equal to one another like:
$$\sum_{i=1}^3 log(\frac{\mathbb{I}(|\vec{A}_i - \vec{p}|_2<0.3)}{|\vec{A}_i - \vec{p}|_2}) = \sum_{i=1}^3 log(\frac{\mathbb{I}(|\vec{B}_i - \vec{p}|_2<0.3)}{|\vec{B}_i - \vec{p}|_2})$$
But I don't know how to solve this. Also bare in mind that I need this to work for examples with points of higher dimensionality ($n > 0$), and when the size of the $m$ dimension of the two matrices are not equal. To help you understand the problem more clearly I have created a visual aid: A graph describing the intersection of the two functions, where the red line indicates where the two functions would be equal.

2898361,The convenient approach to a calculus problem in two variables,"A student came to me with the following problem. Construct a function $g \colon {\Bbb R}\to {\Bbb R}$ such that the function $f \colon {\Bbb R}^2 \to {\Bbb R}$ defined by $$ f(x,y)= \begin{cases} \frac{e^{x^2}-e^{y^2}}{x-y} &\text{if $x \neq y$} \\ g(x) &\text{if $x=y$} \end{cases} $$ is continuous. Is the function $f$ differentiable at the origin? It is immediate to find the unique $g$ that could solve the problem. However, the student was in trouble since he was unable to check that this function $g$ was an actual solution. The computation of $$\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,x_0)} \frac{e^{x^2}-e^{y^2}}{x-y}$$ is intuitive, but the student could not prove rigorously his conjecture. The same for the limit $$\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{f(x,y)-f(0,0)-\nabla f(0,0)\cdot (x,y)}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}.$$ I suggested the use of some Taylor expansion of the exponential around zero, but I wonder if there is some straightforward approach. Actually, the definition of $f$ is given as a ""incremental ratio"" of a smooth function, and I guess there is a general result about the extension of the incremental ratio to the diagonal of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

Any help is much appreciated. Let $X$ be a normed vector space and define the projection onto the unit ball as $\pi(x)$ = $x/||x||$ for $x \in X \setminus \{0\}$. Let $x,y \in X \setminus \{0\}$ with $||x||,||y|| \geq 1$. Must it be the case that we have $||\pi(x) − \pi(y)|| \leq ||x − y||$? I can't seem to find a counterexample so am trying to go for a proof. So far the only observation I have been able to make is this: WLOG we can take $||x|| \leq ||y||$. We may also WLOG take $||x|| = 1$ as otherwise we can replace $x$ with $x' = x/||x||$ and $y$ with $y' = y/||x||$ which does not affect the L.H.S of our inequality which reducing the R.H.S which only makes the inequality more strict. Hence the problem reduces to showing $||x-\pi(y)|| \leq ||x-y||$ with $||x|| = 1$ and $||y|| \geq 1$. If we have $||y|| \geq 3$ then we can use the triangle inequality twice to show this. However I can't find a proof using just $||y|| \geq 1$. How should I proceed?","['normed-spaces', 'linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis', 'vector-spaces']"

2898385,"When does the limit $|\cos(n)|^{f(n)}$ converges as $n \rightarrow \infty, n \in \mathbb{N}$?","Here we go with a not-so-trivial problem: Inspired by another problem that I myself asked here , I came with this more general formulation: Let be the sequence $a(n) = |\cos(n)|^{f(n)}$. Then, when does the sequence $|\cos(n)|^{f(n)}$ converges as $n \rightarrow \infty$, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$? And the only thing that we may vary is $f(n)$. The only constrain for $f(n)$ will be that $f(n)$ increases monotonically and is unbounded . It is easy to see that the numbers that belong to the open interval $(k\pi, (k+1)\pi)$ tend to $0$ as $f(n) \rightarrow \infty$. And on the other side, all natural numbers will always belong to these intervals (if not, that would be equivalent to claim the rationality of $\pi$). Then, all members of the sequence will tend to $0$... All?? Not necessarily, because by Dirichlet's Approximation Theorem , you can always find an integer that is arbitrarily close to a multiple of $\pi$. And the closer you are to a multiple of $\pi$, the closer would be the following and related function to 1: $$
\lim_{x \rightarrow k\pi} |\cos(x)| = 1
$$ On the other hand, if instead of considering functions with real numbers, we focus on our sequence over the natural numbers, we can see that not all the integers approximate to a multiple of $\pi$ in the same manner. There is an integer sequence that every member of the sequence is closer to a multiple of $\pi$ that the previous member ( https://oeis.org/A046947 ). This integer sequence increases exponentially and let be $b(n)$ that sequence. I've seen computationally, that $b(n) \approx \pi^n$. So... As I can see this, here there are to different opposing forces acting one against the other to make converge or diverge our sequence. On one side, the convergence speed of the members of the open intervals $(k\pi, (k+1)\pi)$ towards $0$ ($k\in\mathbb{N}$), which we can control through playing with $f(n)$; and on the other side, the convergence speed of the sequence $b(n)$ to a bigger multiple of $\pi$. but this ""process"" is fixed and we cannot alter it. It seems that: $$
f(n) = 2n \implies \nexists  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} |\cos(n)|^{f(n)} 
$$
This problem seem to be solved here in my previous MSE question. This shows an example of $f(n)$ that makes this sequence diverge, but I strongly think that other expressions for $f(n)$ can make this sequence converge to $0$. My intuition tells me that if $f(n)$ is linear, the sequence will diverge always, but I have that feeling that tells me that if $f(n)$ is exponential , like $f(n) = a^n$, then the sequence will converge if $a > a_0$, being $a_0$ some constant (maybe $\pi$?). So the final question to answer would be: Let $f(n)$ be a monotonically increasing and unbounded sequence whose expression is known. How must be $f(n)$ so: $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} |\cos(n)|^{f(n)} = 0? $$ Many thanks in advance!","['trigonometric-series', 'real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits', 'convergence-divergence']"

However, $\frac{1}{n}S_n \to -1$ almost surely where $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^nX_i$. My proof of this assertion is as follows and I would appreciate it if someone could check its correctness as well as the precision of my reasoning. $(X_n)_n$ being a collection of independent random variables, the event
$\left\{\omega: \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}S_n(\omega) = -1\right\}$ belongs to the tail $\sigma$-algebra and hence has a probability of either zero or one. If I can show that the probability of this event is strictly positive, then I am done. I note that
$$\{X_2 = -1, X_3 = -1, \ldots\} \subset \left\{\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}S_n = -1\right\}$$ By monotone convergence 
$$P\{X_2 = -1, X_3 = -1, \ldots\} = \lim_{n\to\infty}P\{X_2 = -1, \ldots, X_n = -1\}$$
This yields $P\{X_2 = -1, X_3 = -1, \ldots\} = \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $P\left\{\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}S_n = -1\right\} \geq \frac{1}{2}$, which implies $\frac{1}{n}S_n \to -1$ almost surely.

Each child calls heads or tails, and I flip the coin once for each child. If exactly one child calls correctly, that child gets the apple. If there is no one who calls correctly the game repeats. If two children call correctly, the game repeats between the 2 children until only of them calls correctly. Is this game fair; i.e., does each child have the same probability of winning? I am assuming yes intuitively. What about a game in which I only flip the coin once, and each child calls. Is this game fair? I am assuming yes intuitively. What is the expected number of coinflips in my original game? I recursively got 6: Let $N_3, N_2$ be the number of flips for three and two children respectively.  Then for three children:
$$P(0\space correct\space calls) = 1/8 $$
$$P(1\space correct\space call) = 3/8 $$
$$P(2\space correct\space calls) = 3/8 $$
$$P(3\space correct\space calls) = 1/8 $$ Hence: $E(N_3) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot3 + \frac{2}{8}\cdot (3 + E(N_3)) + \frac{3}{8}\cdot(3 + E(N_2))$ For two children: $$P(0\space correct\space calls) = 1/4$$
$$P(1\space correct\space call) = 2/4$$
$$P(2\space correct\space calls) = 1/4$$ Hence: $E(N_2) = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 2 + \frac{1}{2}\cdot (2 + E(N_2))$ Thus: $E(N_2) = 4$ and $E(N_3) = 6$ For the curious, I am trying to see if this ""tournament game"" is ""isomorphic"" to randomly assigning ""T"" to a child, then doing 3 coinflips until a permutation of {T,H,H} is achieved and hence the assigned child gets the apple, as described by Tim Crack in Heard On the Street (17e) .

2898510,Holomorphic Lefschetz formula and basic linear algebra.,"There is a well-known way to prove the fact that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed using Lefschetz fixed point theorem. Let me recall the idea: The existence of a root for any polynomial with complex coefficients is equivalent to the existence of an eigenvector for any endomoprhism of a finite-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{C}$. Indeed, any polynomial is a characteristic polynomial of certain matrix. Assume, that $V$ is a finite-dimensional complex vector space and $A \colon V \to V$ is an endomorphism without eigenvectors. In particular, $A$ has trivial kernel, so it induces an automorphism of the projectivization: $$\overline{A} \colon \mathbb{P}(V) \to \mathbb{P}(V).$$ The group $\mathrm{PGL}(n, \mathbb{C})$ is connected (one doesn't need the main theorem of algebra to prove this), so $\overline{A}$ is homotopic to identity as a diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{P}(V)$. Thus its Lefschetz number equals Euler characteristic of complex projective space, which is non-zero. By Lefschetz fixed point theorem, this implies that $\overline{A}$ has a fixed point. If $l$ is a line fixed by $\overline{A}$, then any vector $v \in l$ is eigen for $A$. Now, my question is the following: what if we apply the holomorphic Lefschetz theorem to a linear automorphism of a projective space? In this case it is easy to compute the right-hand-side: since the only non-tirivial Dolbeaut cohomology group of projective space is $H^{0,0}(\mathbb{CP}^n)$,and $\overline{A}$ acts on it trivial, the holomorphic Lefschetz number equals $1$. What is the left-hand-side in this case? It seems to be certain algebraic expression in coefficients of $A$.

If so, is there a proof that does not rely on the CFSG? Edit: Initially, I thought that I had proved that a minimal counterexample to this conjecture was necessarily simple. Verret's answer shows that this is not the case. Fix a prime $p$ and let $G$ be a minimal counterexample to the conjecture. Suppose that $G$ is not simple. 1) Let $H$ be a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$ and let $P$ be a Sylow $p$ -subgroup of $G$ .
Then $PH$ is a subgroup of $G$ that contains $N_G(P)$ so $N_G(PH)=PH$ .
Also, $PH/H$ is a Sylow $p$ -subgroup of $G/H$ with $$N_{G/H}(PH/H)=N_G(PH)/H=PH/H.$$ Then $G/H$ is solvable by the minimality of $G$ .
However, $G$ is not solvable so $H$ is not solvable. 2) Let $H$ be a proper normal subgroup of $G$ with $G/H$ simple. Then $G/H$ is cyclic of prime order. If $G/H$ is not cyclic of order $p$ then $H$ contains a Sylow $p$ -subgroup of $G$ and thus Sylow $p$ -subgroups of $H$ are self-normalizing. The minimality of $G$ provides a contradiction. This shows that $G/H$ is cyclic of order $p$ . If $p$ does not divide the order of $H$ then $G\cong H\rtimes_\varphi C_p$ for some homomorphism $C_p\to Aut(H)$ . However, Sylow $p$ -subgroups of $G$ are self-normalizing so this homomorphism must be fixed-point-free.

Exercise 9.30(b) in Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis), the defining condition for $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}^2$ implies that the second derivative of $\phi$ is bounded in operator norm by $2\tilde{L}$. But then it follows from the mean value inequality (Theorem 5.15 in Rudin) that $\|\nabla\phi(y)-\nabla\phi(x)\|_2\leq 2\tilde{L}\|y-x\|_2$ for all $x,y$, as required. To handle the case where $\phi$ is not twice differentiable, define $\phi_n:=\phi\ast g_{1/n}$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, where we let $g$ be a smooth bump function supported on the unit ball and define $g_\varepsilon(x):=\varepsilon^{-d}g(x/\varepsilon)$ for $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\varepsilon>0$. It is easy to verify that each $\phi_n$ is smooth and belongs to $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}^2$ (with the same $\tilde{L}$ as before). Since $\nabla\phi_n\to\nabla\phi$ pointwise, we can obtain the desired conclusion by sending $n\to\infty$.","['holder-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

2898638,Can certain families of probability distributions be considered as groups?,"Disclaimer: It is very possible that the notation I will be using is not formally correct. I am not a mathematician, and I'm just trying to write down this idea in a reasonable way. I wasn't able to find literature addressing this topic As an example, take the family of univariate normal distributions with the sum operation. Let see if it satisfies the four defining properties of a group: Closure : Given $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\,\sigma_1^{2})$ and $Y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_2,\,\sigma_2^{2})$, $Z = X+Y$ is also normally distributed, with $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1+\mu_2,\,\sigma_1^{2}+\sigma_2^{2})$ Associativity : It is clear that $(X + Y) + Z = X + (Y + Z)$ in distribution, with $X, Y, Z$ each independently and normally distributed with given means and variances. Identity element : The distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,\,0)$ is the identity element, because any $I \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,0)$ satisfies the property that $Y = X + I = I + X$ is distributed as $X$, with $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\,\sigma_1^{2})$. Inverse element : In this case for any $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\,\sigma_1^{2})$, there exists $-X$ such that $X-X = -X+X = I$, with $I \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,0)$. The four properties seem to be satisfied, therefore couldn't we say that the family of univariate normal distributions with the sum operation constitutes a group? And the same with other several families of distributions and different operations such as sum, product, ratio, etc. Edit : As pointed out below, I should have added that $X$ and $Y$ have to be independent in the first point, otherwise the expression for the variance of the addition is not correct.","['group-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability-theory']"

2898774,Entire function satisfying an iteration formula,"I hope to figure out that what is the entire function $f$ that satisfies the following iteration formula

for some constant $C$. Actually, I guess that $f$ has to be the form $f(z)=e^{-z+a}+be^{i2\pi{z}}+c$ where $a,b,c$ are complex numbers. Clearly, this kind of function satisfies the above formula. I hope to verify my guess, but I can't solve it completely. Some partial results is obtained. Taking derivative gives 
$$f'(z+1)-f'(z)=-Ce^{-z}.$$
Then we have 
$$f(z+1)+f'(z+1)-f(z)-f'(z)=0,$$
that is, $g(z+1)=g(z)$ where $g(z)=f(z)+f'(z)$. If $f$ satisfies some growth condition so that $g$ meet the requirement of Carlson's theorem ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlson%27s_theorem ), then by Carlson's theorem $g$ has to be constant. Thus $f(z)+f'(z)=C$ which implies that $f''(z)+f'(z)=0$. Then $f'(z)=De^{-z}+A$. Combining these with the iteration formula, we can conclude that $f$ is of the form $e^{-z+a}+b$.

2898786,Calculating the degree of some extension of $\mathbb{Q}_3$,"Let $p=3$ and $\zeta$ be a cube root of unity not equal $1$. Consider the field of $3$-adic numbers $\mathbb{Q}_3$.
At the beginning of section 5.4 of Fernando Gouvea's book $p$-adic numbers - An Introduction , he states that the field $\mathbb{Q}_3(\sqrt{2},\zeta)$ is an extension of degree $4$. Furthermore, the fields $\mathbb{Q}_3(\sqrt{2})$ and $\mathbb{Q}_3(\zeta)$ are both extensions of degree $2$. Now I would like to understand why this is true. I understand why we have $[\mathbb{Q}_3(\sqrt{2}):\mathbb{Q}_3]=2$. This is true because $f = x^2-2$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}_3$, as 2 is a quadratic nonresidue, so we can apply Eisenstein's criterion. This means that $f$ is the minimal polynomial of $\sqrt{2}$ which has degree $2$. Therefore, the claim holds. I am also really sure about the fact that $[\mathbb{Q}_3(\zeta):\mathbb{Q}_3]=2$ is true. As $\zeta$ is a cubic root of unity, the minimal polynomial of $\zeta$ divides $x^3 - 1$ which has $1$ as a root, so it is obviously not irreducible. If we divide $x^3 - 1$ by $x-1$, then we obtain the polynomial $g=x^2+x+1$. This must mean that $g$ is the minimal polynomial of $\zeta$ if the degree of the extension is really $2$. But I do not know how to show why $g$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}_3$. To show that $[\mathbb{Q}_3(\zeta,\sqrt{2}):\mathbb{Q}_3] = 4$, we only have to show either $\zeta \not\in \mathbb{Q}_3(\sqrt{2})$ or $\sqrt{2} \not\in \mathbb{Q}_3(\zeta)$, so we can apply the tower law. For instance, we assume $\zeta \in \mathbb{Q}_3(\sqrt{2})$. Then there exist coefficients $c_1,c_2 \in \mathbb{Q}_3$ such that $\zeta = c_1 + c_2 \sqrt{2}$ because we know that $\mathbb{Q}_3(\sqrt{2})$ is a vector space of $\mathbb{Q}_3$ of dimension $2$ with basis $\{1,\sqrt{2}\}$. Then
$$ 0 = \zeta^2 + \zeta + 1 = (c_1^2 + 2c_2^2+c_1+1) + (2c_1c_2+c_2)\sqrt{2}  $$
and therefore $c_1^2 + 2c_2^2+c_1+1=0$ and $2c_1c_2+c_2=0$. But this looks like a really difficult system of equations to solve, as I know nothing about $c_1$ and $c_2$.

Suppose that all $D_v (a)$ exist and that $D_{(v_1, v_2)} f (a)= 5v_1 ^2 + v_2$. Is $f$ differentiable in $a$? I think it is differentiable. The only way I can think of solving this problem is by using the sufficient condition of differentiability: Let $A$ be open in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $a \in A$ and $f:A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$. If the partial derivatives $D_1 f(x),...,D_n f(x)$ exist in an open ball $B(a,r)$ and they are all continuous in $a$ then $f$ is differentiable in $a$. So the values of the partial derivatives in $a$ are $D_1 f (a)= 5 \cdot 1^2+0$ and $D_2 f (a)= 5 \cdot 0^2+1 = 1$  and they exist because all directional derivatives exist by hypothesis.

What if they are not relatively prime? Here $\textrm{ord}_n(b)$ is the multiplicative order of $b$, i.e. the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $b^m=1 (\textrm{mod}\,n)$. The naive guess that $\textrm{ord}_n(ab)$ is $\textrm{lcm}(\textrm{ord}_n(a),\textrm{ord}_n(b))$ can not be right since it gives $\textrm{ord}_n(b^k)=\textrm{ord}_n(b)$, whereas in fact 
$\textrm{ord}_n(b^k)=\frac{\textrm{ord}_n(b)}{\textrm{gcd}(\textrm{ord}_n(b),k)}$.

Is there a formula for the general case? If not, are there formulas for some special cases, e.g. when $a,b$ are relatively prime, square-free, prime powers, when $n$ is prime, etc.?

2898981,Question on a proof that there are infinitely many primes,"There are several ways to prove this fact, and I can think of two reasonably clear ways, but my professor presented a sketch of a proof that I can't quite follow. I'm going to replicate his logic as best as I can. Theorem. There are infinitely many primes. Proof. Assume for a contradiction that there are only finitely many primes, which we can list as $p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Then, form the product 
\begin{align*}
N = \mathop{\Pi}\limits_{i=1}^m p_i + 1.
\end{align*}
From here there are several ways to proceed. But, this is where I find myself getting confused. Since $\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under multiplication and addition, $N \in \mathbb{Z}$, and since $N > p_i, \forall i$, $N$ is not a prime. So, there exists some $p_i$ such that $p_i \mid N$, so $\exists a \in \mathbb{Z}, a \cdot p_i = N$, i.e., $a \cdot p_i = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot p_3 \cdots p_m + 1$. From here, my professor concluded that $\frac{1}{p_i} \in \mathbb{Z}$, an absurdity and thus a contradiction. I can't quite figure out how to get there. If we divide both sides through by $p_i$, since $1 \leq i \leq m$, we get $a$ on the LHS and two terms on the RHS, one of which is a product of $m - 1$ primes (after cancelling) and one of which is $\frac{1}{p_i}$. From here, perhaps we could subtract the product of $m - 1$ terms, clearly an integer by closure under multiplication, from $a$, also an integer. Then, by closure under subtraction, $a$ less this product is also an integer, in which case we've found our contradiction. Is this correct?

2899048,"Find all triples $(p,x,y)$ such that $ p^x=y^4+4$","Find all triples $(p,x,y)$ such that $ p^x=y^4+4$, where $ p$ is a prime and $ x$ and $ y$ are natural numbers. I know that this question has already been asked on another forum, but I want to ask different questions about it. $ p^x=y^4+4$ $ p^x=(y^2+2)^2 - (2y)^2$ $p^x = (y^2+2y+2)(y^2-2y+2)$ Then: $p^k = y^2+2y+2$ and $p^j= y^2-2y+2$ The solutions I saw were different from here and they just wanted to prove that $(5,1,1)$ was the only solution. I´ll just ask what I didn't understand: 1) Therefore, $p^k = (y+1)^2+1$ and $p^j= (y-1)^2+1$ And then: $(y+1)^2 \equiv (y-1)^2 \equiv -1 \pmod p$ So here $-1$ is a quadratic residue, and therefore $p= 4n+1$. I understood his solution until this part. I know that $p= 4n+1$ because I saw that was one of the properties of quadratic residues, but would like to see a proof of it if possible. He then says that by$\mod 8$ , $ k$ and $j$ had different parity, so $x$ was odd. Then he assumes that $p, k >1$ and says: If $k=2m$, then: $(y+1)^2= (p^m+1)(p^m -1)$ or if $j= 2m$: then $(y-1)^2= (p^m+1)(p^m -1)$ and affirms those equations have no solution, that might be a property but want to know about it anyway. Then he says there are no solution for $x>1$, then $p = (y^2+2y+2)(y^2-2y+2)$, so $1=y^2-2y+2$ and that was the triple $(5,1,1)$, therefore that is the only solution. 2) He started off by saying: if $y$ is even then $ p^k \equiv  p^j \equiv 2 \pmod 4$ then $a = b =1$ and that is not possible, therefore $y$ is odd. Since $ 4y = p^{b} - p^{a}$, therefore $ p^{b-a}=5$, $ p^{a}=y$ $ 2y^{2}+4=p^{b}+p^{a}$, if $ a\neq 0$, then $ y^2 \equiv 3\mod 5$, which is impossible. I don´t know how you can deduce those things. After that he affirmed that $(5,1,1)$ was the only solution. 3) He showed that $y$ was odd and said: $gcd (y^2+2y+2, y^2-2y+2) = gcd (y^2+2y+2, 4y) = 1$ (I think this is also a property but I don´t even know it). And since $y^2+2y+2 >  y^2-2y+2$, then $y^2+2y+2=p^x$ and $y^2-2y+2 =1$, so $y=1$ and $(5,1,1)$ was the only solution. Sorry if I asked many things, I just thought those things may be useful for other problems. I pointed out the things I didn´t understood so that it was easy to see them.

2899075,"Assuming the Axiom of Countable Choice, an infinite set $A$ is Dedekind-infinite","Theorem: Assuming the Axiom of Countable Choice, an infinite set $A$ is Dedekind-infinite. Lemma 1 : assuming the Axiom of Countable Choice, if $A$ is an infinite set, then $A$ contains a countably infinite subset. Please check my below proof! Thank you for your help! By Lemma 1 , there exists a countably infinite subset $B$ of $A$. Let $(b_1,b_2,\cdots)$ be a listing of the elements of $B$, without repetition. We define a function $f:A \to A$ by $f(b_i)=b_{2i}$ for all $i \in \mathbb N$ and $f(a)=a$ for all $a \in A \setminus B$. Then $f$ is clearly injective. Furthermore, $f(A)=A \setminus \{b_1,b_3,b_5,\cdots\}$, then $f(A) \subsetneq A$.  Hence $f:A \to f(A)$ is a bijection from $A$ to a proper subset of $A$. Consequently, $A$ is Dedekind-infinite.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"
