2655859,Number of subsets with subscripts being a multiple of each other?,"Let set $S = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{12}\}$, where all 12 elements are distinct. We wish to form subsets, each of which contains one or more of the elements of set $S$ (including the possibility of using all the elements of $S$). The only restriction is that the subscript of each element in a specific set must be an integer multiple of the smallest subscript in that set. For example, $\{a_2, a_4, a_6\}$ is an acceptable set, as is $\{a_6\}.$ How many such sets can be formed? My approach to this problem was to start off with using a1 as the lowest subscript, leading to 2^11 options for the rest of the subsets that use a1. I then repeated the process up to a6, and added 1 for the rest of the subsets a7 through a10. What am I doing wrong?","['combinatorics', 'contest-math', 'elementary-set-theory']"

2655934,Proving in Quine's New Foundations,"I'm reading Quine's New Foundations paper. However, there are a lot of questions I do not manage to answer. I would say they all lead to the question: how to prove things in NF? For example, is it provable in NF that $\forall x (x \in \{x\})$ or commutativity of identity, being this latter defined as $x = y \stackrel{def}{=} \forall w (x \in w \rightarrow z \in w)$ and finally how do you prove - if possible - that $x = y \wedge z \in x \rightarrow z \in y$ with just the axioms and definitions Quine provides in his paper? I came up with these questions in connection with something Quine says in his paper. He says that the ""unrestricted"" abstraction principle $\exists x \forall y (y \in x \leftrightarrow \phi)$ for $x$ not occurring in $\phi$, provides a class $x$ about which he says ""viz. $\widehat{y} \phi$"". Now, I think this means that from the abstraction principle you can prove $\widehat{y}\phi$ for any $\phi$ of the required kind, is it so? I do not even manage to prove that $x = y \rightarrow x \subset y \wedge y \subset x$","['logic', 'elementary-set-theory', 'foundations']"

2655973,Intuition with Complex Derivatives of a Complex Variable.,"I'm having some trouble wrapping my mind around derivatives of a complex function of a complex variable.This is a function of two real inputs and two real outputs, correct? What confuses me is that in multivariable calculus, the functions were of multivariable input, and had one real output.  So when calculating the derivative, you'd have to know what vector you're calculating it on. In the complex space however, with two inputs and two outputs, I feel like this would also be the case? But it seems like we can use all the standard rules from single variable calc. What am I misunderstanding?

2656057,How can a cone have non-zero Riemann curvature yet can be made out of a piece of paper?,"A cone with a $90^\circ$ vertex angle can be parameterized by $$(x, y, z) = (z \cos \theta, z \sin \theta, z).$$ The metric on the cone can then be found to be $$dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 = 2 dz^2 + z^2 d \theta.$$ The only non-zero Christoffel symbols are $$\Gamma^z_{\space \space \theta \theta} = -\frac{1}{z} \hspace{1 cm}\Gamma^\theta_{\space \space \theta z} = \frac{z}{2}$$ and the only non-zero independent component of the Riemann curvature tensor is $$R_{z \theta z \theta} = 2 z^{-2} + 1.$$ It's possible I made a mistake in the above computations, but I believe they are correct. This shows that a cone is not locally flat. However, a cone in real life can be formed by curving a piece of paper. For example, to compute the surface area of a cone, you can consider the surface area of a pac-man shape laying flat on a table. When the top and bottom of the mouth of the pac-man are brought together, the paper is in the shape of a cone. The Christoffel symbols and Riemann tensor contain no information on the embedding of a manifold in ambient space. Therefore, it would seem to me that the Riemann tensor would have to be $0$, as it would be for flat piece of paper. How can this be?",['differential-geometry']
2656086,When is the Euler-Lagrange equation trivially satisfied?,"In calculus of variations, we seek the functions $y(x)$ extremising the quantity $$I = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} F(x, y, y') \, dx.$$ To find these functions, we solve the Euler-Lagrange equation $$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = \frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{\partial F}{\partial y'} \right].$$ Sometimes the E-L equation is trivially satisfied. This means that given boundary conditions $y(x_1) = y_1$ and $y(x_2)=y_2$, all functions $y(x)$ are extremals, i.e. $I$ is independent of the path $y$. In such a situation, I understand that the Lagrangian $F$ simplifies to a total derivative. Here are two examples: 1) $I = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} (y^2 + 2xyy') dx$. We compute $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 2y + 2xy'$ and $\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{\partial F}{\partial y'} \right] = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ 2xy \right] = 2y + 2xy'$. We then show path-independence by writing $I = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} (y^2 + 2xyy') dx = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \frac{d}{dx} \left[ xy^2 \right] dx = \left[ xy^2 \right]_{x_1}^{x_2}$. 2) $I = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} (\frac{y'}{y}) dx$. We compute $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = -\frac{y'}{y^2}$ and $\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{\partial F}{\partial y'} \right] = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{1}{y} \right] = -\frac{y'}{y^2}$. We then show path-independence by writing $I = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \frac{y'}{y} dx = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \log |y| \right] dx = \left[ \log |y| \right]_{x_1}^{x_2}$. I want to know how to figure out what the Lagrangian is the total derivative of. In the two examples above I got the total derivatives by trial and error, but I would like to know what the answer is in general.","['euler-lagrange-equation', 'partial-derivative', 'calculus', 'calculus-of-variations', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
2656124,"$\dim H^0(X, \mathcal{O}_D) \leq 1 + \deg D$ when $-1 \leq \deg D \leq g - 1$","$X$ is a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$. I'm starting to wonder whether this statement (in my title) is true at all or whether it's a typo...it seems impossible to prove using just the Riemann-Roch theorem, unless I'm not seeing something simple. Do I need to use more than just Riemann-Roch? I can only do the case $\deg(D) = -1$ right now. I'll just explain my notation here, I'm using Otto Forster's notation from his book Lectures on Riemann Surfaces. $D$ is a divisor on $X$. $H^0(X, \mathcal{O}_D)$ is obviously the 0-th cohomology group of X with respect to the sheaf $\mathcal{O}_D$ where $\mathcal{O}_D (U) = \{ f \in \mathcal{M}(U)| \mathrm{ord}_x(f) \geq -D(x) \, \forall x\in U  \}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ is the sheaf of meromorphic functions. The version of Riemann-Roch with which I'm familiar is: for a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g$ and a divisor $D$ on it, $\dim H^0(X, \mathcal{O}_D) - \dim H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_D) = 1 - g + \deg D$. I also tried using the consequence of the Serre Duality which asserts that $\dim H^1(\mathcal{O}_D) = \dim H^0(X, \Omega_{-D})$ where $\Omega_{-D}$ is the sheaf of meromorphic 1-forms that are multiples of $-D$. But I just cannot get the above inequality! Could I please get a hint?","['riemann-surfaces', 'sheaf-theory', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-cohomology']"

2656231,Proving that softmax converges to argmax as we scale x,"For a vector $\mathbb{x}$ , the softmax function $S:\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ is defined as $$
S(x;c)_i = \frac{e^{c\cdot x_i}}{\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{c\cdot x_k}}
$$ Consider if we scale the softmax with constant $c$ , $$
S(x;c)_i = \frac{e^{c\cdot x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{d} e^{c\cdot x_j}}
$$ Now since $e^x$ is an increasing and diverging function, as $c$ grows, $S(x)$ will emphasize more and more the max value. At $c \rightarrow \infty$ , $S(x)$ outputs a one-hot vector with 1 at the position of the maximum element. Now this is my intuition, but how do I prove this?","['proof-writing', 'probability']"

2656388,Definition of Surjectivity in set-theoretical definition of functions,"I am puzzled by the question of how to define surjectivity in the light of the set-theoretical definition of functions. A function $f : A \rightarrow B$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is a subset $f \subseteq A \times B$ of the Cartesian product $A \times B$ such that the following conditions hold: $\forall a \in A : \exists b \in B : (a,b) \in f$ $\forall a \in A : \forall b, b' \in B : (a,b), (a,b') \in f \rightarrow b=b'$ Both conditions encode the idea that for every value $a \in A$ there exists a unique output value $b \in B$. A function $f : A \rightarrow B$ is surjective if $ \forall b \in B : \exists a \in A : f(a) = b$. We note that the notion of a function being surjective depends on the codomain of the function; by enlarging the codomain the function loses any surjectivity and by shrinking the codomain a function may eventually become surjective. However, in the set-theoretical definition of functions we identify functions by their graph, which is enough to recover the domain $A$ and the image $f(A)$, but not enough to recover the codomain $B$. For example, the identity function $f : \{0\} \rightarrow \{0\}$ is surjective and can be identified with its graph: $f = \{ (0,0) \} \in \{0\} \times \{0\}$.
However, this is also the graph of the non-surjective function $f : \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb R$. It seems intuitive to me the ""same"" function with different codomains is actually different functions. Consequently, the codomain should be included as information when we define a ""function object"" in mathematics.","['foundations', 'elementary-set-theory']"

2656614,Strong law of large numbers and uniform convergence on compact sets,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function and let $(X_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ be idependent and identical copies of the random variable $X$. Suppose all these random variabes are integrable. I know from the strong law of large numbers that
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i) = E[f(X)]
$$
with probability one. Suppose we have a sequence of continuous functions $(f_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ that converges to $f$ uniformly on compact sets. Does it hold that
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f_n(X_i) = E[f(X)]
$$
with probability one? I know that if the convergence to $f$ is uniform, then the above is probably true. I'm curious about if it also holds for uniform convergence on compact sets. Edit: My thoughts. The following is to show that if the convergence to $f$ is uniform, then the above is true.
Define
$$
a_n := \sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n} |f(x) - f_n(x)|. 
$$
Observe that
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i) - f_n(X_i) + f_n(X_i) = E[f(X)]
$$
$$
\implies \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f_n(X_i) - \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i) + f_n(X_i) = E[f(X)].
$$
Therefore, if we have uniform convergence then $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = 0 \implies$ we have the desired result by using Cesaro means to show that the last sum on the left hand side of the equation goes to zero.

2656851,Understanding the branch cut and discontinuity of the hypergeometric function,"I am going through this paper, and I am having trouble understanding page 20. I am still learning my way around managing multi valued complex functions, so I'd like your help in understanding what's happening there. I have the definition of the hypergeometric series $_2F_1$ as
$$
_2F_1(a,b;c;z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_n(b)_n}{(c)_n}\frac{z^n}{n!}.
$$
Here $(a)_n$ is the rising Pochhammer symbol, $(a)_n=\Gamma(a+n)/\Gamma(a)$ (well defined whenever $a$ is not a negative integer or zero). By elementary computations, the radius of convergence of this series is 1. It is then said that $_2F_1$ can be continued analitically in the whole complex plane along any curve not passing through $[1;+\infty)$, and $1$ itself is a branching point and the function has a cut on the previous segment. Furthermore, equation $2.115$ of the paper computes the discontinuity when crossing the branch cut as (with $x\geq4/3$ to have the real part of the argument bigger than one)
$$
_2F_1\left(\frac16,\frac56;1;\frac{3x}4+i\epsilon\right)-_2F_1\left(\frac16,\frac56;1;\frac{3x}4-i\epsilon\right)=i\, _2F_1\left(\frac16,\frac56,1;1-\frac{3x}4\right).
$$
I am trying to understand those results. It is not clear to me how to understand from the power series form the behaviour on the boundary of the disk of convergence. It is clear to me that the series in $z=1$ diverges, as the coefficients do not go to zero, so there should be no analytical continuation. A way to study that function would be its integral representation:
$$
_2F_1(a,b;c;z)=\frac{\Gamma(c)}{\Gamma(b)\Gamma(c-b)}\int_0^1t^{b-1}(1-t)^{c-b-1}(1-zt)^{-a}dt.
$$
Here it is understood that $\arg t=0=\arg(1-t)$. From this representation, it is clear to me that the function can have branches whenever $a$ is not a positive integer, and if $z\in[1;\infty)$ we have $0$ in the integration path, so we can have multiple branches. And that's exactly my case. The problem is that I can't use this form to prove the previous equation about the discontinuity: all I manage to write is (here I write z=x with x real number bigger than one, and I am neglecting some numerical factors that can easily be reinserted)
$$
\lim_{\epsilon\to0}((1-xt-i\epsilon t)^{-a}-(1-xt+i\epsilon t)^{-a})=-(1-e^{-2i\pi a})(1-xt)^{-a}.
$$
This is different from the line that I would like to prove (as an example, I do not see why I should change the argument, but I also see that with that argument changing the function is at least evaluated in a point where well defineteness is guaranteed). To summarize, I have two questions: How to prove the discontinuity from the integral form? More in general: how to treat power series in order to understand if their singularities are poles or branch cuts, and the discontinuity of their analytic continuations? I know that this is a very broad topic, and I'd also like some references to continue my study.

2656934,Proof of $\angle$ sum of polygon.,"First, I know this question might have been asked by several times, see here , for an example.
Before someone may want to mark it as dulplicate , I would like to calrify what I want to ask. Mainly, I am asking for a rigorous proof, or why it is rigorous enough ? Notes: I will be considering simple polygon . Consider the answer of this post by Misha Lavrov, What makes things worse is that people often work with polygons on a
  somewhat intuitive level I agree with this. I definitely know that $$Interior\space\angle\space sum\space of\space a\space N-sided\space polygon=(N-2)180^\circ$$ as every high school text shall states. Most of the proofs which I have seen about the problem, has a similar idea as the accepted answer of this post . Main idea of the proof: For a polygon, we will just select points to join segments, and then we can devide the polygon into several pieces, and by $\angle$ sum of $\triangle$, we can find the $\angle$ sum of the polygon . This proof is very intuitive, but  I don't think it is rigorous enough, as I wonder, can we still connect every vertex to the point, even for a extremely ugly concave polygon, to seperate the polygon, into several $\triangle$s, such that each of the interior $\angle$ of each of the $\triangle$s is in an interior $\angle$ of the polygon and won't be counted twice. For an explaination and example for what I said right above, see below. e.g.) For a 'ugly' 23-sided polygon, which I drew 'randomly' : As in the image above, I discovered a way to divide the polygon into 21 pieces of $\triangle$, while it sounds to be eligible. However, I don't think this will certainly happen , if the polygon is even more ugly. How to explicitly consider the case, when different $\triangle$ share a same interior $\angle$ in the proof? Also, as I asked above, can we always find a way to devide it properly? (I think it is important to prove it) I also considered the way in this post . For the induction part, asumming the $\angle$ sum formula for polygon is true for $N$-sided polygon. Then, consider any $N+1$-sided polygon, I used to think that we can select $2$ vertex which is saperate by one vertex in middle (can I present it more precisely?), join them together, and we form a $\triangle$ (Do we need to consider whether 'convex' or 'concave' ?). Then we form a $N$-sided polygon, and by the induction hypothesis and $\angle$ sum of $\triangle$, we can prove the formula holds for $N+1$. But, moreover, do we need to consider this case and/or this case , when the remaining polygon might not be $N$-sided? TO SUM UP, How can we consider all possible cases and make a rigorous proof? Most importantly, I want a justification of the constructability (I mean whether the graph is constructable/valid, not for the Compass-and-straightedge construction ) and generality of a graph, if there is a graph in the proof. Remember, as I said above, I am looking for a rigorous proof, not an usual one .

2656945,Proving a few properties of Bertrand curves,"Here's what I've got so far (and I'm assuming $\alpha$ is a unit speed curve): a) The fact that $\beta(s) = \alpha(s) + r(s)N(s)$ for some scalar function $r$ follows trivially because of the fact that the normal lines of $\beta$ and $\alpha$ are equal (so $\beta(s)$ is a point on the normal line of $\alpha(s)$, which is precisely what the equality states). Then: $$\ r(s) = (\beta(s) - \alpha(s))N(s) \Rightarrow r'(s) = (\beta'(s) -
    \alpha'(s))N(s) + (\beta(s) - \alpha(s))N'(s)  $$ $$r'(s) = (\beta'(s) -\alpha'(s))N(s) + r(s)N(s)N'(s) = (\beta'(s) -
    \alpha'(s))N(s)= \beta'(s)N(s) = 0$$ as desired. b) Let $\theta$ be the angle between the unit tangent vectors mentioned. Then: $$\cos(\theta) = \frac{\beta'(s)\alpha'(s)}{||\beta'(s)||} = \frac{1-r(s)k(s)}{||\beta'(s)||}$$ but $$||\beta'(s)||^2 = ||\alpha'(s)||^2 + r^2(s)||N(s)||^2 = 1 + r^2(s)$$ so $$||\beta'(s)|| = \sqrt{1+r^2(s)}$$ $$\cos(\theta) = \frac{1-r(s)k(s)}{\sqrt{1+r^2(s)}}$$ EDIT: The formula for $||\beta'(s)||^2$ above is wrong. Actually, $||\beta'(s)||^2 = ||\alpha'(s)||^2 + r^2(s)||N'(s)||^2$, which is not as neat as the above. But the hint in the comments is much better to solve this. c) Assuming I had done b) , then the following would be true: $$(\cos(\theta))' = \left( \frac{\beta'(s)\alpha'(s)}{||\beta'(s)||} \right)' = 0 \Rightarrow (\beta'(s)\alpha'(s))' = 0 \Rightarrow \beta''(s)\alpha'(s) + \beta'(s)\alpha''(s) = 0$$ but continuing on this path only leads to $k'(s) = 0$, which, even if I had done b), would not be useful (and I'm aware using this to prove b) is circular). Beyond these (b) and c)), I would also like some help solving d) and $21$ (I don't know where to start on those). Update : A lot of what I wrote above is wrong, but my doubts here are almost completely solved. I just have to finish $21$ and I'll be done. Update 2 : For $20$, see the discussion in comments. For $21$: Since $T_\beta$ is orthogonal to $N_\alpha$, we can write it as a linear combination of $T_\alpha$ and $B_\alpha$. In particular: $$T_\beta = \pm (\cos(\theta)T_\alpha + \sin(\theta)B_\alpha)$$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the unit tangent vectors of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Then: $$B_\beta = T_\beta \times N_\beta = \pm T_\beta \times N_\alpha = \pm (\cos(\theta)T_\alpha + \sin(\theta)B_\alpha) N_\alpha= \pm(\cos(\theta)B_\alpha - \sin(\theta)T_\alpha)$$
Differentiating and using the fact that $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$ are constant, we have: $$B_\beta' = \pm(\cos(\theta)B_\alpha' -\sin(\theta) T_\alpha') = \pm(-\cos(\theta)\tau_\alpha N_\alpha - \sin(\theta)\kappa_\alpha N_\alpha)$$
$$B_\beta' = \pm(-\cos(\theta)\tau_\alpha - \sin(\theta)\kappa_\alpha)N_\alpha$$ By the Frenet frame, we also have: $$B_\beta' = -\tau_\beta N_\beta = \pm(-\tau_\beta N_\alpha) $$ So: $$\pm(-\cos(\theta)\tau_\alpha - \sin(\theta)\kappa_\alpha)N_\alpha =  \pm(-\tau_\beta N_\alpha) \Rightarrow (\cos(\theta)\tau_\alpha + \sin(\theta)\kappa_\alpha) = \pm \tau_b $$ By previous work: $$\cot(\theta) = \frac{1-r(s)\kappa_\alpha(s)}{r(s) \tau_\alpha(s)}$$ which is equivalent to:
$$\kappa_\alpha(s) + \cot(\theta) \tau_\alpha = \frac{1}{r(s)} \Rightarrow \kappa_\alpha(s) \sin(\theta) + \tau_\alpha(s) \cos(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{r(s)}$$ Then: $$\pm (\cos(\theta)\tau_\alpha + \sin(\theta)\kappa_\alpha) = \pm \frac{\sin(\theta)}{r(s)} = \tau_\beta(s)$$ $\bar{s}$ being the arclength paramater, we also have: $$T_\beta = \frac{d \beta}{ds} \frac{ds}{d\bar{s}}$$ so: $$T_\beta = \left( ( 1 - r(s) \kappa_\alpha(s))T_\alpha + r(s) \tau_\alpha(s) b_\alpha(s) \right ) \frac{ds}{d\bar{s}}$$ comparing the very first expression for the coefficients, we see that: $$\pm \sin(\theta) = r(s) \tau_\alpha(s) \frac{ds}{d \bar{s}}$$ so that: $$\frac{d \bar{s}}{ds} = \frac{r(s)\tau_\alpha(s)}{\sin(\theta)}$$ and then, by previous work: $$\pm \frac{\tau_\alpha(s) \tau_\beta(s) r(s)}{\sin(\theta)} = \pm \frac{\sin(\theta)}{r(s)} \Rightarrow \tau_\alpha(s) \tau_\beta(s) = \frac{\sin^2{\theta}}{r^2(s)}$$ as desired.","['curves', 'frenet-frame', 'differential-geometry']"

I think I keep getting errors, but this should give something close to 
$$\frac{a_n}{\alpha(n)} - p\cdot\frac{a_{n-1}}{\alpha(n-1)} = (1-p) + n\cdot p^1q^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n-2}\binom{n-i}{i}p^{n-i}q^ia_i.$$ I think $$\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n-2}\binom{n-i}{i}p^{n-i}q^ia_i = p\cdot\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n-2}\binom{n-i}{i}p^{(n-1) - i}q^ia_i = p\Big(\frac{a_{n-i}}{\alpha(n)} - 1\Big).$$ I should then be able to stick this back in and solve. However, I seem to get a different answer, and regardless, this still is far from being a closed form solution. Any suggestions?

2657045,Limit of a sequenced defined by arithmetic mean and geometric mean.,"If $a_1 =\alpha$, $ a_2 = \beta$, and, for every $k$, $$a_{2k+1}= \frac{1} {2k}  \sum_{i=1}^{2k} a_i\qquad a_{2k+2}=\left(\prod_{i=1}^{2k+1} a_i\right)^{1/(2k+1)}$$
  what is the limit of the sequence $(a_k)$?, That is, what is $\lim_{n\to\infty}{a_n}?$ I think this sequence converges, but i can't find a clue to figure out its limit. When $\alpha=\beta$, it is clear that $a_n=\alpha$ However, if $\alpha\neq\beta,$ I think i cannot calculate exactly wht $a_n$is, so I'm currently stuck. I know that for all $k$, $\alpha \le a_k \le \beta$, and I think that this sequence converges towards somewhere close to $\min(\alpha, \beta)$ because
$a_1=\alpha$, $a_2=\beta$, $a_3=\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2}$, $a_4=(\frac{\alpha\beta(\alpha+\beta)}{2})^{1/3}$, but I can't figure out what to do next. For example, here is a sequence when $\alpha=2, \beta=4$:
$$a_1=2, a_2=4, a_3=3, a_4=2.8845, a_5=2.9711, a_6=2.90162, a_7=2.95953, a_8=2.9098, a_9=2.95331, a_{10}=2.91462, a_{11}=2.9494, a_{12}=2.91776, a_{13}=2.9468, a_{14}=2.91998...$$
Edit: I think as $n$ increases, $$a_{2k+2}\le a_{2k+4}\le a_{2k+3}\le a_{2k+1}$$
Could anybody confirm this please? If this is right, $a_n$ converges to $2.9.....$ I found that the above inequality is right using mathematical induction Let $\alpha<\beta$, then $a_3=\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}$, $a_4=\sqrt[3]{\alpha\beta\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}}=\sqrt[3]{(\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}+\frac{\beta-\alpha}{2})(\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}-\frac{\beta-\alpha}{2})(\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2})}=\sqrt[3]{(\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2})^3-A}<\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}=a_3$
  If $a_{2k+1}>a_{2k+2}$, 
  $$a_{2k+3}=\frac{1}{2k+2}\sum_{i=1}^{2k+2}{a_i}=\frac{a_{2k+2}+a_{2k+1}+\sum_{i=1}^{2k}{a_i}}{2k+2}=\frac{a_{2k+2}+(2k+1)a_{2k+1}}{2k+2}\\\therefore a_{2k+2}<a_{2k+3}<a_{2k+1}\\a_{2k+4}=(\prod_{i=1}^{2k+3}{a_i})^{\frac{1}{2k+3}}=(a_{2k+3}\cdot (a_{2k+2})^{2k+2})^{\frac{1}{2k+3}}\\\therefore a_{2k+2}<a_{2k+4}<a_{2k+3}\\\therefore a_{2k+2}<a_{2k+4}<a_{2k+3}<a_{2k+1}$$By the mathematical induction, for all natural number $n$, $a_{2n+2}<a_{2n+4}<a_{2n+3}<a_{2n+1}$ This means that the sequence $\{a_{2n}\}$ and $\{a_{2n+1}\}$ converges, since the two sequences are monotone increasing and monotone decreasing, and the two sequences are bounded(since $\alpha<\{a_{2n}\}<\{a_{2n+1}\}<\beta$).
Now I want to know whether the two limits of these two sequences are the same, which means $\{a_{n}\}$ converges.","['means', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence']"

If $f^*\mathcal O_{X'}(1)=\mathcal O_{X}(1)$ and $h^0(X,\mathcal O_{X}(1))=n+1$ then obviously we can lift $f$ to $\mathbb P^n$. So we need two conditions: $h^0(X,\mathcal O_{X}(1))=n+1$. Using the exact sequence $0\to \mathcal O(1-d)\to \mathcal O(1) \to \mathcal O_X(1)\to 0$ this is true if $h^0(\mathbb P^n,\mathcal O(1-d))=h^1(\mathbb P^n,\mathcal O(1-d))=0$ , which trivially holds for $d>1$.

But I am looking for global version. A trivial example would be $f(x)=Bx$ with $-A+B<0$. My approach: Let $x_l(t)$ denote the solution of the linear system and $x(t)$ of the nonlinear. Moreover, suppose that $f(x)$ is uniformly bounded, say $||f(x)||<\beta$ with $\beta>0$, and that $f(x)=0\iff x=0$. It follows that
\begin{equation}

|| x(t)-x_l(t)|| &= ||\int_0^te^{-A(t-\tau)}f(x(\tau))d\tau||\\

2657457,"Pythagorean triples that ""survive"" Euler's totient function","Suppose you have three positive integers $a, b, c$ that form a Pythagorean triple:
\begin{equation}

Additionally, suppose that when you apply Euler's totient function to each term, the equation still holds:
$$
  \phi(a^2) + \phi(b^2) = \phi(c^2). \tag{2}\label{2}
$$
One way this can happen is if $a^2, b^2, c^2$ have the same primes in their prime factorization. (For example, starting from the Pythagorean triple $3,4,5$, we could multiply all three terms by $30$ to get $90, 120, 150$. If we do, then we have $90^2 + 120^2 = 150^2$ and $\phi(90^2) + \phi(120^2) = \phi(150^2)$.) In that case, because all three terms are squares, they all contain these prime factors at least twice, and so we must have
$$
   \phi(\phi(a^2)) + \phi(\phi(b^2)) = \phi(\phi(c^2)). \tag{3}\label{3}
$$
My question is: are there any ""atypical"" solutions to the two equations $\eqref{1}$ and $\eqref{2}$ for which $\eqref{3}$ does not hold? Or at least where $\eqref{1}$ and $\eqref{2}$ hold, but the prime factorizations of $a,b,c$ do not consist of the same primes, even if $\eqref{3}$ happens to hold for a different reason? In the comments, Peter and Gerry Myerson have checked small cases (all triples for $1 \le a \le b \le 10^5$ and primitive triples generated by $(m,n)$ for $1 \le n \le m \le 2000$) without finding any atypical solutions. Here is an in-depth explanation for why typical solutions like $(90,120,150)$ work. By a typical solution, I mean a solution where $a,b,c$ have the same primes in their prime factorization. Such a triple satisfies $\eqref{2}$ and $\eqref{3}$ whenever it satisfies $\eqref{1}$, as shown below. Let $\operatorname{rad}(x)$ denote the radical of $x$: the product of all distinct prime factors of $x$. To get a typical solution, we start with any Pythagorean triple, then scale $(a,b,c)$ so that $\operatorname{rad}(a) = \operatorname{rad}(b) = \operatorname{rad}(c) = r$. It is a general totient function identity that whenever $\operatorname{rad}(x) = r$, $\phi(x) = \frac{\phi(r)}{r} \cdot x$. In other words, $\phi(x) = x \prod\limits_{p \mid x} \frac{p-1}{p}$ where the product is over all primes $p$ that divide $x$. In the case above, we have
$$
   \phi(a^2) + \phi(b^2) = \frac{\phi(r)}{r} \cdot a^2 + \frac{\phi(r)}{r} \cdot b^2 = \frac{\phi(r)}{r} \cdot c^2 = \phi(c^2),
$$
and $\eqref{2}$ holds.
Moreover, since $r \mid a,b,c$, we have $r^2 \mid a^2,b^2,c^2$, so when we multiply by $\frac{\phi(r)}{r}$, we have $r \phi(r) \mid \phi(a^2), \phi(b^2), \phi(c^2)$. Therefore all prime factors of $r \phi(r)$ divide each of $\phi(a^2)$, $\phi(b^2)$, and $\phi(c^2)$. These are all their prime factors, since $r$ contained all the prime factors of $a^2, b^2,c^2$ and since then the only new prime factors introduced came from multiplying by $\phi(r)$. As a result, $\phi(a^2), \phi(b^2), \phi(c^2)$ still have the same set of prime factors: $\operatorname{rad}(\phi(a^2)) = \operatorname{rad}(r \phi(r)) = s$, and similarly $\operatorname{rad}(\phi(b^2)) = \operatorname{rad}(\phi(c^2)) = s$. So $\eqref{3}$ holds, because
$$
   \phi(\phi(a^2)) + \phi(\phi(b^2)) = \frac{\phi(s)}{s} \cdot \phi(a^2) + \frac{\phi(s)}{s} \cdot \phi(b^2) = \frac{\phi(s)}{s} \cdot \phi(c^2) = \phi(\phi(c^2)).

Suppose I have a drawer with an equal number of N black socks and N white socks. They're all mixed up. So, my chances of picking a matching pair in the first two selections is (N-1)/(2N-1), right? Well, what if, before I pick the first sock, I randomly (so I don't know the colors of the socks I'm moving) partition the drawer so that there are N socks on each side, and I draw one sock from each side. Do the chances of drawing a matching pair change ? On the one hand, we can see that selection from one side doesn't change the composition of socks on the other side of the partition. However, whichever color I choose from the ""first"" side, it's likely that there are more of that color on that side. On other words, if I draw a black sock from one side, it's more likely that that side had N-1 blacks and 1 white than it is that that side had 1 black and N-1 whites.

$$
s_\lambda (1,\ldots,1) = \frac{1}{k!} \chi^\lambda(\mathbb{1}) z_\lambda(d)\,, \quad {\rm where} \quad z_\lambda(d) = \prod_{(i,j)\in \lambda} (d+j-i)

$$
For our purposes, given a partition $\lambda$, $s_\lambda (1,\ldots,1)$ is just some polynomial in $d$.

The marginal pdf of $X$ is $f_X(x) = 1$ In theory with $f_X(x)$ I can calculate any probability for $X$. I believe that is the whole point of having a pdf for a random variable. Therefore:$$P(X>YZ) = \int_{YZ}^{1}dx$$ $$=1-YZ$$ But this definitely isn't the right answer (which as you see below is $3/4$). The book solution makes complete sense to me.
