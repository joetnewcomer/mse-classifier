446494,Hard Differential Equation. Please help.,"first of all I'm not a mathematician, so I apologize if any of my understanding and terminology isn't up to par.  Also, I've never used this website (or any of these kind of question/answer) websites before, hope it works. I'm a mech. eng having trouble with a differential equation that is crucial to my research in graduate school.  I've spend a long time trying to look up and understand tons of sources anything from books to buddies around the college. This is the differential equation: $$
\dfrac{F(t)}{\left(\frac{dy(x)}{dx}\right)^2+1}=c^2y^2\left(\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2}\right)^2
$$ I'm trying to solve for y which I THINK is dependent on x only, but i'm not sure.  It could be y(x) or y(t). I also think this is a 1st order non-linear non-homogenous DE, but again I'm not sure.  I initially thought it might be a partial differential equation though. Any help would be greatly appreciated!","['physics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'classical-mechanics', 'differential-geometry']"

446559,"If $(W,<)$ is a well-ordered set and $f : W \rightarrow W$ is an increasing function, then $f(x) ≥ x$ for each $x \in W$","I could use a hand understanding a proof from Jech's Set Theory . Firstly, note that Jech defines that an increasing function $f : P \rightarrow Q$ is a function that preserves strict inequalities (where $P$ and $Q$ are partially ordered sets). We then have Lemma 2.4. If $(W,<)$ is a well-ordered set and $f : W \rightarrow W$ is an increasing
function, then $f(x) ≥ x$ for each $x \in W$. I'm having difficulty understanding the proof. It goes like so. Proof . Assume that the set $X = \{x \in W : f(x) < x\}$ is nonempty and let $z$
be the least element of $X$. If $w = f(z)$, then $f(w) < w$, a contradiction. I get the first sentence - we're doing a proof by contradiction, which is why $X$ is non-empty, and since $W$ is well-ordered, we can conclude that $X$ has a minimum element, and we call it $z$. What's going on in the second sentence?","['well-orders', 'ordinals', 'elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory']"

446713,Weighted integral of random variables,"Given a random zero-mean gaussian random variable $X(t)$ with parameter $t$, such that $E [X(t) X(t^\prime)] = \sigma^2 (t) \delta_{tt^\prime}$, is it possible to produce a single gaussian random variable that is the weighted sum of all $X(t)$ by a non-random function $f(t)$? In other words, is $Z=\int_0^T f(t) X(t) dt$ well defined, and if so, is $Z$ a gaussian normal random variable, and what is its variance? My naive attempt is to discretize the integral
\begin{equation}
Z = \int_0^T f(t) X(t) dt
\approx \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(n \delta T) X(n \delta T) \delta T
\end{equation}
where $\delta T = T/N$. Now, if we take the simplest limit where $\sigma(t) = \sigma_0$ and $f(t) = 1$, this reduces to 
\begin{eqnarray}
Z & = & \frac{T}{N}\sum X_n
\end{eqnarray}
But this is a gaussian random variable with $\sigma = \sqrt{N} \delta T \sigma_0 = T \sigma_0 / \sqrt{N}$, which has $\sigma \rightarrow 0$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. If I were to take a guess, I'd assume $Z$ would be gaussian and have variance $\sigma^2 = \int_0^T f^2(t) \sigma^2(t) dt$, but I have been unable to show this.","['stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-integrals', 'random-variables', 'probability-theory', 'normal-distribution']"

I understood how to perform the integrals out, but I never got a hold of what the physical meaning was.  I understand the introductory meaning of the integral $\int_a^b f(x)\space dx$ as the area under the curve f(x). However, once I got into complex analysis, we dealt with nasty integrals (such as Cauchy)
$$f(a)=\frac 1 {2\pi i} \oint_C \frac {f(z)} {z-a} dz$$

446746,Polynomial rings -- Inherited properties from coefficient ring,"To avoid mixing up things, I wanted to collect properties a polynomial ring is inheriting from the coefficient ring and what property implies another. Let $R$ be a ring (what else do I need at which point, so $1$, commutative, etc. -- our teacher is somehow not paying to much attention on these details). A. It is $R^*=R[X]^*$ iff $R$ is a field.
Why? What about $R[X][Y]^*=R[X,Y]^*=?$ B. $R$ factorial (or $R$ field) $\implies$ $R[X]$ is factorial $\implies$ $R[X,Y]$ is factorial C. Digested property hierarchy: field euclidean ring (missing ? to a field?) principal ideal domain (no euclidean function exists -- intuitive meaning?) factorial ring here unique factorization domain (not every ideal is a principal ideal -- intuitive meaning?) integral domain (no unique factorization of elements) commutative ring ring (not commutative) Where to insert division ring, so the existence of inverses for every $a\in R\setminus\{0\}$?
I'm missing the intuition about these terms, so why is it clear, that a principal ideal domain is a integral domain? Is it just my teacher being sloppy and actually a principal ideal domain is defined as a factorial ring where every ideal is a principal ideal and so forth? Since in my definition it just says ""a commutative ring, with 1, where every ideal is a principal ideal, is a principal ideal domain"". D. Example.
Let $R = \mathbb{Q}[X,Y]$. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is a field, it follows, that $R$ is factorial.
Hence (going down the aforementioned hierarchy) $R$ is a integral domain, a commutative ring, a ring.
Is it a division ring? I guess it is $R[X,Y]^*=R^*=\mathbb{Q}\setminus\{0\}$. My idea is that $R$ is a principal ideal domain, but I didn't find a very rigorous argument. I think there are basically only the trivial ideals in $R$, and for the trivial ideals it is clear, that they are principal ideals since $R=R1$ and $\{0\}=R\{0\}$. I don't know how to decide on euclidean and field. Just my intuition is, that i can't have division with remainder and therefore $R$ shouldn't be a euclidean ring and therefore not a field. But how ""to show"" that there can't be a euclidean function on $R$?

446773,Trace for $L^\infty$ functions?,"I'm considering the following problem. Let $s\in L^\infty ((0,T)\times K)$ for some compact $K\subset \mathbb{R^n}$ be given. Consider the Steklov average in time of $s$, i.e. for $h>0$ and $t\in(0,T-h)$ define $$s_h(x,t)=\int_t^{t+h} s(x,\tau) d\tau$$
and choose $s=0$  for $t>T$. Now let $f$ be some smooth function in $(0,T)\times K$. Due to the Steklov average $s_h \in H^1(0,T;L^\infty(\Omega))$.
Hence it is allowed to write for almost every $sigma\in (0,T-h)$ $$\int_K s_h(x,\sigma)f(x,\sigma) dx $$.Of course I want to send $h\to 0$.
Now $s_h\to s$ at least in $L^2((0,T)\times \Omega)$. So for a subsequence we find pointwise convergence.
Then formally we find for that subsequence and a.e. $t\in (0,T)$ that
$$\int_K s_h(x,\sigma)f(x,\sigma) dx \to \int_K s(x,t) f(x,t) $$. But I don't get the justification for this: $s$ does not have a trace so it can be changed arbirtrarily in $t$. So the integral on the right hand side might be different for any representative of $s$ might even depend on the subsequence. (for each representative the subsequence might be different I think).

446789,Why does every undirected graph have at least one cut of size $|E| / 2$?,"In an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, a global maximum cut in $G$ is a pair $(S, V - S)$ with the largest possible number of edges with one endpoint in $S$ and another endpoint in $V - S$ (this quantity is called the size of the cut). There is a well-known randomized approximation algorithm for finding a maximum cut that, on expectation, produces a cut of size $|E| / 2$ regardless of the graph.  Consequently, this means that every graph must have a cut whose size is at least $|E| / 2$. Although I completely understand why the above proof establishes why such a cut must exist, I don't have a good intuitive understanding of why this is the case.

446951,"How far can we get without a foundation, using just first-order logic?","I think its interesting to ask how far we can get without committing to any particular foundations, using just first-order logic. For instance, we can prove theorems in this way about partially ordered sets, groups, fields etc. by just going straight from the axioms. Okay, now suppose we have two partially ordered sets $P$ and $Q$ and an order-preserving function $f : P \rightarrow Q$. Even without any model theory, we can still reason about this configuration . We do this by forming a new first-order theory, whose domain of discourse can be viewed as being $P \cup Q$ (or a superset thereof). Formally, our signature includes two unary predicates $P$ and $Q$, where $P(x)$ can be read '$x$ belongs to $P$' and $Q(x)$ can be read '$x$ belongs to $Q$.' More suggestively, lets write $x \in P$ and $x \in Q$ to mean $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ respectively. We also need a unary function symbol $f$ together with the axiom $$\forall x \in P : f(x) \in Q$$ Also, we need a relation symbol $\leq$. To express that $f$ is order-preserving, we assume: $$\forall x,y \in P : x \leq y \Rightarrow f(x) \leq f(y)$$ Finally, we must assume that the axioms of a partially ordered set hold when relativized to $P$, and also to $Q$. This amounts to six different axioms. $\forall x \in P : x \leq x$ $\forall x,y \in P : x \leq y, y \leq x \Rightarrow x=y$ $\forall x,y,z \in P : x \leq y, y \leq z \Rightarrow x \leq z$ $\forall x \in Q : x \leq x$ $\forall x,y \in Q : x \leq y, y \leq x \Rightarrow x=y$ $\forall x,y,z \in Q : x \leq y, y \leq z \Rightarrow x \leq z$ Okay, that's the setup. Using the formal system we just constructed, we can reason about the configuration $f : P \rightarrow Q,$ where $f$ is an order-preserving function and $P$ and $Q$ are partially ordered sets. So my question is: how far can we get in this way, without committing to any particular foundations, and at what point do we hit a brick wall?","['logic', 'foundations', 'abstract-algebra']"

The behavior going on at the beginning shows one way in which it might deviate from a spiral shape, where it seems to twist itself into the opposite orientation. 2) Is this interesting? Obviously this can only tell us anything about zeros on the critical line so it's not saying anything interesting for the big problem :) But a ""yes"" answer to this question might be something like: there is a more useful notion of ""orientation of a zero"" which looks at a whole neighborhood of the zero.

The question is the following. Let $F = \{ f_a \}_{a \in A}$ be a family of holomorphic functions on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk $\overline{\mathbb{D}} = \{ z \in \mathbb{C}  \mid |z| \leq 1 \}$. Suppose also that $$
\int \limits_{0}^{2\pi} |f_a(e^{i \phi})|^{1/2} d\phi \leq 1
$$ for every $a \in A$. Prove that $F = \{ f_a \}_{a \in A}$ is a normal family in the unit disk $\mathbb{D} = \{ z \in \mathbb{C}  \mid |z| < 1 \}$. My Attempt My idea is to use Montel's theorem , so I want to show that the family $F$ is uniformly bounded on compact subsets of $\mathbb{D}$. Thus letting $K \subset \mathbb{D}$ be compact, then there's a positive constant $0 < M_K < 1$, such that for every $\xi \in K$ we have $|\xi| \leq M_K$. Then using Cauchy's integral formula we obtain, for any $a \in A$ and $\xi \in K$ \begin{align}
f_a(\xi) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int \limits_{\partial \mathbb{D}} \frac{f_a(z)}{z - \xi} \, dz = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int \limits_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{f_a(e^{i \phi})}{e^{i\phi} - \xi} \cdot ie^{i\phi} \, d\phi
\end{align}
Then taking absolute values we get \begin{align}
|f_a(\xi)| &\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int \limits_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{|f_a(e^{i \phi})|}{|e^{i\phi} - \xi|} \cdot |ie^{i\phi}| \, d\phi \\
&\leq  \frac{1}{2\pi} \int \limits_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{|f_a(e^{i \phi})|}{ 1 - |\xi|}  \, d\phi\\
&\leq \frac{1}{2\pi(1 - M_K)}  \int \limits_{0}^{2\pi} |f_a(e^{i \phi})| \, d\phi\\
&= C_K \int \limits_{0}^{2\pi} |f_a(e^{i \phi})| \, d\phi
\end{align}
where we put $C_K := \dfrac{1}{2\pi(1 - M_K)}$, and the reverse triangle inequality was used to bound $\dfrac{1}{|e^{i\phi} - \xi|} \leq \dfrac{1}{1 - |\xi|}$. The constant $C_K$ is independent of $a$ and $\xi$. Hence if I can somehow use the hypothesis that $\int \limits_{0}^{2\pi} |f_a(e^{i \phi})|^{1/2} \, d\phi \leq 1$ to bound the last integral then the problem would be solved because Montel's theorem would apply.

447220,Hartshorne's weird definition of right derived functors and prop. III 2.6,"There is something very weird with the way Hartshorne defines right derived functors. Hartshorne p 204 Let $\mathfrak A$ be an abelian category with enough injectives, and let $F \colon \mathfrak A \to \mathfrak B$ be a covariant left exact functor. Then we construct the right derived functors $R^iF, i ≥ 0$, of $F$ as follows. For each object $A$ of $\mathfrak A$, choose once and for all an injective resolution $I^.$ of $A$. Then we define $R^iF(A) = h^i(F(I^.))$ With Prop 1.2A. Hartshorne claims that one can also compute the right exact functor $R^iF$ with a resolution $J^i$ that is acyclic for F. But then, in prop. 2.6 (and similarly in prop. 8.4) Hartshorne states what was already true by definition: that the derived functors of $\Gamma(X,^.)$ coincide with the cohomology functors $H^i(X,^.)$. The proof goes around a circle to show the obvious fact that an injective resolution is equivalent to itself. Namely, that every injective is flasque (2.4), and flasques are acyclic (2.5), so by 1.2A. (above) we can use this very injective resolution(!). What do we need to go around like that?","['category-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Solution: Assume that the system of equations $AX=B$ has more than one solution. This means that the reduced row echelon matrix form of the solution to the equation $AX=B$ has at least one free variable, because if all of the variables were pivot variables, then we would be left with a set of unique values for the variables and hence one solution. Therefore, with at least one free variable, we have that the variable(s) can vary over the real numbers. Hence, there are infinitely many solutions. Thank you!",['linear-algebra']
447334,Asymptotics of the lower approximation of a pair of natural numbers by a coprime pair,"When we are working, for instance, in combinatorics or graph theory, sometimes we can have the following situation. For each number $m$ from an infinite set $\mathbb M\subset\mathbb N$ we can construct an example $\mathcal E(m)$ having the required properties. Moreover, for each $n\ge m$ we can use the example $\mathcal E(m)$ for the construction of the example $\mathcal E(n)$ having properties similar to these of $\mathcal E(m)$ . If we wish to obtain the respective asymptotic bound for $E(n)$ for all natural $n$ , we encounter a problem to asymptotically estimate the approximation from below of the natural number $n$ by a number $m$ from the set $\mathbb M$ . For instance, in my old and small work "" On graphs without 4-cycles "" I investigated the problem posed by Erich Friedman here : what is the maximal number $E(n)$ of edges an $n$ -vertex graph without 4-cycles? I found the asymptotics $E(n)=\frac{n^{3/2}}2\left(1+O\left(\frac 1{\ln n}\right)\right)$ as follows. We can easily prove that $E(n)\le\frac{n+n\sqrt{4n-3}}4$ . We can obtain, using projective planes over finite fields, that $E(n)\ge\frac{(n-1)(\sqrt{4n-3}+1)}4-1$ provided $n=q^2+q+1$ where $q$ is a power of a prime. Then, using Rosser's bounds [Ros] $\frac n{\ln n+2}<\pi(n)<\frac n{\ln n-4}$ for $n\ge 55$ , where $\pi(n)$ is the quantity of prime numbers which are not greater than $n$ , I was able to show that for every natural $n\ge 2$ there exists a prime number $p\in\left[n-\frac {6n}{\ln n};n\right]$ . I finally obtained the asymptotics for $E(n)$ from the above results. At the last week I met my old coauthor, Oleg Verbitsky who proposed me the following problem. Let $n$ be a natural number. What is the minimal number $d=d(n)$ such that for each number $n'\ge n$ there exist coprime natural numbers $p,p'$ such that $n-d\le p\le n$ and $n'-d\le p'\le n'$ ? In his research where the question appeared, it is well enough that $d(n)=o(n)$ , hence Oleg do not need any specific bound for $d(n)$ . However,  he thinks that the function $d(n)$ is of independent interest. To obtain the upper bound for $d(n)$ , Oleg simply took a largest prime number not greater than $n$ (my number intuition immediately said that this bound should be too weak), and using the result by Baker, Harman and Pintz [BHP], saying that for sufficiently large $n$ there is a prime belonging to $[n-n^{0.525}, n]$ (by the way, this bound is asymptotically better than my above bound $n-\frac {6n}{\ln n}$ ), he obtained the bound $d(n)=o(n)$ . But both of us are not number theorists,  so my efforts to improve the bound may be an invention of a bicycle. So we decided that it is better to pose the question here. As usually, we are interested mainly in asymptotics of the function $d(n)$ . What have I tried? I expect that $d(n)$ is asymptotically very small (but not an independent on $m$ constant). I have the following evidence for this. Let $k(l)$ be a number of different prime divisors of a number $l$ . Then $k(l)\le \log_2 l$ and this bound can be (essentially) improved using the inequality $l\ge p_1 p_2\dots p_{k(l)}$ instead of $l\ge 2\times 2\times\dots 2$ ( $k(l)$ times), where $p_i$ is the $i$ -th prime number (that is $p_1=2$ , $p_2=3$ and so forth). Moreover, slightly decreasing $n$ to $m$ we should obtain $k(m)$ even essentially smaller than $k(n)$ . For finding such a number $m$ we can use (the above) results on the prime numbers density. So, let $\{q_1,\dots, q_{k(m)}\}$ be the set of all prime divisors of the number $m$ . Then among $d+1$ numbers $n', n'-1,\dots n'-d$ about $(d+1)(1-q_1)\ge (d+1)(1-p_1)$ are not divisible by $q_1$ . Among these numbers about $(d+1)(1-q_1)(1-q_2)\ge (d+1)(1-p_1)(1-p_2)$ are not divisible by $q_2$ and so on. Therefore if $(d(n)+1)(1-p_1)(1-p_2)\dots (1-p_{k(m)})>1$ (which can be assured by a respectively small $d(n)$ ) then there should exist a coprime pair $p,p'$ such that $n-d\le p\le n$ and $n'-d\le p'\le n'$ .

x_{11};x_{21},x_{12};x_{31},x_{22},x_{13};x_{41},x_{32},x_{23},x_{14};\dots\tag{*}
$$ If any two of the sets $E_n$ have elements in common, these will appear more than once in $(*)$. Hence there is a subset $T$ of the set of all positive integers such that $S\sim T$, which shows that $S$ is at most countable. Since $E_1\subset S$, and $E_1$ is infinite, $S$ is infinite, and thus countable. $\blacksquare$ How does the bolded sentence follow from all previous? In fact, I do not know how the matrix and $(*)$ come into play.",['real-analysis']
447518,Intuitive explanation of Lyapunov condition for CLT,"I found the Lyapunov condition for applying the central limit theorem, which is useful in settings where one has to deal with non-identically distributed random variables: Lyapunov CLT. Let $s_n^2 = \sum_{k=1}^n \text{Var}[Y_i]$ and let $Y=\sum_i Y_i$. If there exists $\ell>0$ s.t.: 
$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left( \frac{1}{s_n^{2+\ell}}\sum_{k=1}^n \text{E}\left[ |Y_k - \text{E}[Y_k]|^{2+\ell}\right] \right) = 0$, then $Z=(Y - E[Y])/\sqrt{Var[Y]}$ converges to the standard normal distribution. While I have no problem showing that this condition holds for certain exercises, I'm wondering what the intuition is behind this condition.","['probability-theory', 'weak-convergence', 'probability-limit-theorems', 'intuition']"
447524,Why does zero derivative imply a function is locally constant?,"I've been trying to prove to myself that if $\Omega$ is an open connected set in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then if $f\colon\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^m$ is a differentiable function such that $f'(x)=0$ for all $x\in\Omega$, then $f$ is constant. I've reduced the problem to just showing $f$ is locally constant on $\Omega$. Given $x_0\in\Omega$, I know that 
$$
\lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{\|f(x)-f(x_0)-f'(x_0)(x-x_0)\|}{\|x-x_0\|}=\lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{\|f(x)-f(x_0)\|}{\|x-x_0\|}=0.
$$ This implies $\lim_{x\to x_0}\|f(x)-f(x_0)\|=0$. So for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists some open ball $B(x_0,\delta)$ around $x_0$ in $\Omega$ such that $\|f(x)-f(x_0)\|<\epsilon$ for $x\in B(x_0,\delta)$. But since the choice of the open ball changes with $\epsilon$, I don't think I can conclude $\|f(x)-f(x_0)\|=0$ for $x\in B$. So this doesn't convince me that there actually exists a neighborhood of $x_0$ on which $f$ is constant. How can you make the leap from zero derivative to locally constant?","['general-topology', 'connectedness', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
447540,Restriction on exponent; Weak Harnack inequality for strong solutions,"The weak Harnack inequality for strong solutions goes as follows (Taking $Lu = a^{ij}(x)D_{ij}u + b^i(x)D_iu+c(x)u$ to be elliptic) Let $u\in W^{2,n}(\Omega)$ satisfy $Lu\leq f$ in $\Omega$ for some function $f\in L^n(\Omega)$ and suppose $u\geq 0$ in some $B = B_{2R}(y)\subseteq\Omega$. Then $$\left(\frac{1}{|B_R|}\int_{B_R} u^p\right)^{1/p}\leq C\left(\inf_{B_R} u + \frac{R}{\lambda}\|f\|_{L^n(B)}\right)$$ where $p$ and $C$ are positive constants. I am to show that $p\leq\frac{n}{(n-1)\frac{\Lambda}{\lambda}-1}$ where $\lambda,\Lambda$ denotes the least and greates eigenvalues of $L$, but somehow the proof escapes me. Any hints?","['functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations', 'analysis']"
