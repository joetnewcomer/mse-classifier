1336271,Change from product to sum,We know that : $$a \times b = \underbrace{a + a + a + ... + a}_{\text{b times}}$$ That's how we convert from a product to a sum. So what happens if we go a little further? That is : $$\prod\limits_{a}^{b} {f(x)} = \sum\limits_{?}^{?} {?}$$ $$\text{where } b>a$$ What will be in the place of those $'?'$ So if $f(x) = \sin{(x)} \text{ or } = x^3 \text{ or } = a^x$ or something like that? Or what if $b=\infty$ ? I guess this is a silly question but please help! Thanks!,"['summation', 'infinite-product', 'algebra-precalculus', 'products']"

1336278,How can I prove that $f$ doesn't have all real roots $\forall a\in\mathbb{C}$,"We have $f=x^4+ax^3+4x^2+1\in\mathbb{C}[x]$ with $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\in\mathbb{C}$. We need to prove that $\color\red{\forall a\in\mathbb{C}},f$ doesn't have all real roots. How can I begin to solve this exercise.

What generally is the procedure of finding the min and max values in the set $K$? As far as I know we should check for min/max values on the bounds of K.

1336295,How to modify a $H^1$ weak convergence sequence so that I have the $L^2$ equi-integrability of gradient?,"Assume $u_n\to u$ weakly in $H^1(\Omega)$ where $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^N$ is open bounded Lipschitz boundary. My goal is to find a new sequence $\bar u_n$ and a new function $\bar u$ such that $\int_\Omega|\nabla \bar u_n|^2dx\leq \int_\Omega|\nabla u_n|^2dx$ and $\int_\Omega|\nabla \bar u|^2dx\leq \int_\Omega|\nabla u|^2dx$ $\bar{u}_n\to \bar{u}$ weakly in $H^1$. $\nabla \bar u_n$ is $L^2$-equi-integrable, i.e., for any $\epsilon>0$ we have there exists $\delta>0$ such that for all set $T\subset \Omega$ with $\mathcal L^N(T)<\delta$ we have
$$
\sup_{n\in\mathbb N}\int_{T} |\nabla \bar u_n|^2dx<\epsilon. \tag 1
$$ My idea is to define
$$
\bar u_n:=\min_{v\in\mathcal A(u_n)}\left\{\int_\Omega|\nabla v^2|\,dx\right\},\text{ and }\bar u:=\min_{v\in\mathcal A(u)}\left\{\int_\Omega|\nabla v^2|\,dx\right\},
$$
where 
$$  
\mathcal A(u_n):=\left\{v\in H^1(\Omega), T[v]=T[u_n]\right\},
$$
and $T[\cdot]$ denotes the usual trace operator. The property $1$ is obviously true. The prove of property $2$ I put it at the end of this post. Please help me to check whether it is correct. However, I can not prove property $3$. The best I can do is assuming $(1)$ does not hold, i.e., there exists a sequence of set $T_n\subset \Omega$ such that $\lim_{n\to 0}\mathcal L^N(T_n)=0$ and 
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{T_n}|\nabla \bar u_n|^2dx\geq \epsilon>0
$$
and hope to have a contradiction. We can compute
$$
\liminf_{n\to\infty}\int_\Omega|\nabla \bar u_n|^2dx\geq \liminf_{n\to\infty}\int_{\Omega\setminus T_n}|\nabla \bar u_n|^2dx+\liminf_{n\to\infty}\int_{T_n}|\nabla \bar u_n|^2dx\geq \int_\Omega|\nabla \bar u\,|^2dx+\epsilon 
$$
but I can not get any contradiction from here. I feel I need to use the minimality of $\nabla\bar u_n$ but I don't see how... Any help of new idea of how to construct $\bar u_n$ is really welcome! Below is how to proof property $2$. Now let me prove property $2$. Clearly $\bar u_n$ is bounded in $H^1$ and hence, up to a subsequence, $\bar u_n\to u_0$ weakly in $H^1$. I only need to prove that $u_0=\bar u$. To do so, I only need to prove that $u_0$ is the weak solution of PDE
$$
\begin{cases}
-\Delta v=0, & x\in\Omega\\
v=u, & x\in\partial\Omega
\end{cases}
$$
By weak convergence in $H^1$, we have 
$$
\int_\Omega \nabla u_0\nabla \phi=0
$$
for all $\phi\in H_0^1(\Omega)$. I only need to prove that $u_0\in \mathcal A(u)$ then I would be done. To do so, I need to prove $u_0-u\in H_0^1(\Omega)$. I will claim
$$
\left|\int_\Omega (u_0-u)(x) \partial_i\varphi(x)dx\right|\leq C\|\varphi\|_{L^2(\Omega)}
$$
for all $\phi\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb R^N)$. We observe that 
\begin{multline}
\left|\int_\Omega (u_0-u)(x) \partial_i\varphi(x)dx\right|=\\
\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\int_\Omega (\bar u_n-u_n)(x) \partial_i\varphi(x)dx\right|=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\int_\Omega \partial x_i(\bar u_n-u_n)(x) \varphi(x)dx\right|\\
\leq \lim_{n\to\infty}\|\nabla (\bar u_n-u_n)\|_{L^2}\|v\|_{L^2}\leq C\|v\|_{L^2}
\end{multline}
as desired, where the 3rd inequality used the fact that $T[\bar u_n-u_n]\equiv 0$. Hence, by the uniqueness of solution, we have $u_0=\bar u$, and hence property $2$ is true.

1336314,Showing that a Fourier transform is holomorphic,"Let $f\in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ be a Schwartz function. I would like to show that the Fourier function
$$F(z)=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(t)e^{itz}\, dt$$
is an entire function. Here is my approach: Write $z=x+iy$ and note that $itz=it(x+iy)=-ty+itx$. Thus,
$$F(z)=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(t)e^{-ty}e^{itx}\, dt$$
which shows that $F(z)$ exists for each $z$, because $f(t)e^{-ty}$ is also a Schwartz function and $F(z)$ is written as the (real) Fourier transform of a Schwartz function which is convergent. Use Morera's theorem (together with Cauchy integral formula and Fubini's theorem) to conclude. Of course, to complete the second step I need to check the continuity of $F$ which probably requires the dominated convergence theorem. My questions is whether there is an alternative/neater way of proving that $F$ is entire. (For instance, can Morera's theorem be avoided by an application of the dominated convergence theorem or one of its cousins to differentiate under the integral sign?)","['complex-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

I noticed that, frequently, the numerical solution of a trigonometric equation is written using the equal sign (as in (ii)) even the numerical answer has been rounded. Why equal sign is used instead of approximation sign? In this case, does the equal sign have a different meaning?","['notation', 'trigonometry']"

$$ It should be noted that Interchanging/swapping any two rows (or columns) of $C$ does not affect matrix $D$ (and vice versa). Any change in $C$ or $D$ or both $C$ and $D$ changes matrix $E$. Problem: If some vertices of $G$ is rearranged (i.e., permuted), $A$  will be different, say, this new matrix is $B$. Again, matrix $B$ can be divided into 4 sub matrices  based on adjacency of vertex $x \in G$ and $ B_x$ can be obtained. Assume: $C$ is always the adjacency matrix of a regular graph and bigger than $D$. There exists an algorithm that always order $D$ (for a vertex $x \in G$) takes $O(K)$ time (assumed to be polynomial/exponential, does not matter). Each row of E has different permutation, i.e., rows might have same number of 1's but different permutation/arrangement  of 1. For $n$ vertices there will be total $n$ numbers of $C,D$, each of them will take $O(K)$ (assumed to be polynomial) time to sort. If each $C$ takes time $O(f(n))$ to sort, then the total complexity will be $O(n \cdot K \cdot f(n))$. Question: According to the three assumptions above, does there exist a polynomial time algorithm to sort $C$ so that $B=A$? I.e., is there a polynomial $f$ ?

1336350,Differential Equation with Cross Products [without separating into system of equations],"I need to solve the following equation: $$ \frac{d m}{d t}=-m\wedge b-\alpha m\wedge (m\wedge b), $$ where $b$ is constant However, I was instructed specifically not to separate the calculation into a system of equations (which would not be linear and would be pretty complicated). I was told, instead, that there is a smarter way to do it. I managed to do some of it. I found the angle between m and b. And now I'm stuck. Here is what I did so far: $$\frac{dm}{dt} \cdot m = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{d\vert m \vert}{dt} = 0$$ Naming $u=|m\wedge b|^2$ and $v=m\cdot b$, we instantly get the relation:
$$u+v^2=k^2$$
Where $k$ is a constant independent of time and of value $k=|b||m|$.
We can rewrite the original equation as the following (triple product): $$ \frac{d m}{d t}=-m\wedge b-\alpha (m\cdot b)m + \alpha (m\cdot m)b $$ Then, $$\frac{dm}{dt} \cdot b = - \alpha(m\cdot b)(m\cdot b) + \alpha(m\cdot m)(b\cdot b)$$ $$\frac{dv}{dt} = - \alpha v^2 + \alpha k^2 $$ We also retrieve that $$\frac{dv}{dt} = - \alpha u $$ To solve the differential equation in v, we divide both sides by $ (k^2 - v^2)$, and then integrate. $$ln|v-k| - ln|v+k| = -2\alpha kt - 2C$$ $$|\frac{v-k}{v+k}| = e^{-2\alpha k t - 2C}$$ We know that $k>0$ and $v>0$, and that always $v<=k$, then $|\frac{v-k}{v+k}| = -\frac{v-k}{v+k}$ and the equation yields: $$v = -k\frac{1-e^{-2\alpha k t - 2C}}{1+e^{-2\alpha k t - 2C}} = -k\tanh(\alpha k t + C)$$ $$u = \frac{k^2}{\cosh^2(\alpha k t + C)}$$ We can extract: $$\cos(\phi) = \frac{k}{|m||b|\cosh(\alpha k t + C)}$$ $$\sin(\phi) = \frac{k \tanh(\alpha k t + C)}{|m||b|}$$ But $|m|$ and $|b|$ are constants.","['cross-product', 'calculus', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'linear-algebra']"
1336357,How does one define a group with commutative diagrams?,"I am currently working through McLarty's book on Elementary Categories, Elementary Toposes.

It maps the terminal object (which would have to be the subgroup of 1 element) into $G$ . Why not define $e: G \to G$ since it takes every element to itself? Why isn't the first diagram two-sided to account for $e \cdot x = x = x \cdot e$ ? Why are the two maps of the second diagram the same? Since we want to claim that $x\cdot x^{-1} = e = x^{-1} \cdot x$ , shouldn't one of the top maps be $\left< \_^{-1}, G\right>$ ? I'm assuming the map `` $G$ "" means the unique identity map.

Since any non-trivial open set is basically $\mathbb{Z}$ -{a finite set of integers}. 3 is false because given two integers $a,b$ if i try to look for two disjoint open sets $U_a$ , $U_b$ they will always have a infinite number of points in their intersection. 4 is true since if i take any open set in $\tau$ (which is of the above type) it  must intersect a infinite subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ .

1336559,Boileau-Orevkov on the intersection of a complex curve with 3-sphere,"Motivation: Feel free to skip. Let $\Sigma$ be a complex curve in $\mathbb{C}^2$. If $\Sigma$ is transverse to a 3-sphere $S^3 \subset \mathbb{C}^2$ of radius $r$, then $\Sigma \cap S^3$ is a link, sometimes called a transverse $\mathbb{C}$-link . These include links of singularities and can shed light on the topology of $\Sigma$. Results of Rudolph and of Boileau-Orevkov show that the set of transverse $\mathbb{C}$-links is equal to the set of quasipositive links, which are defined in purely braid-theoretic terms. (For those interested, quasipositive braids are products of conjugates $w  \sigma_i w^{-1}$, where $w$ is any word in the braid group $B_n$ and $\sigma_i$ is a positive generator.) In particular, Boileau and Orevkov prove the following in this paper : Theorem. If a complex curve $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{C}^2$ intersects $S^3$ transversally, then $\Sigma \cap S^3$ is the closure of a quasipositive braid. To prove this, they show that a smooth piece $(\Sigma,\partial \Sigma)\subset (B^4,S^3)$ of a complex curve in $\mathbb{C}^2$ is an ascending surface (defined below), and then use properties of ascending surfaces to show that $\partial \Sigma$ is a quasipositive link. We can  define a 1-form $\eta$ in $\mathbb{C}^2$ using either of the two equivalent definitions:
\begin{align*}
\eta &:= 
x_1 \, dy_1 - y_1 \, dx_1 + x_2 \, dy_2 - y_2 \, dx_2 
\\
&\ =\tfrac{i}{2}(z \, d\bar{z}-\bar{z} \, dz +w \, d\bar{w} - \bar{w}\, dw).
\end{align*}
(The restriction of $\eta$ to the 3-sphere of radius $r$ defines a contact structure $\alpha_r:= \eta\mid_{S^3_r}$.) Let $F$ be a smooth oriented surface properly embedded in the unit 4-ball $B^4 \subset \mathbb{C}^2$, assumed to miss the origin and be transverse to $\partial B^4 = S^3 \subset \mathbb{C}^2$. We say that $F$ is ascending if (1) the distance function $\rho(z,w)=\sqrt{|z|^2+|w|^2}$ is Morse when restricted to $F$, and (2) at all regular points of $\rho\mid_F$, we have $(d\rho \wedge \eta)\mid_F>0$. Boileau and Orevkov make the following assertion, which they claim follows immediately from the definition of an ascending surface: Let $F\subset B_1$ be an ascending surface. If $p \in F$ is a critical point of $\rho\mid_F$, then $T_p F = \ker \alpha_r$, where $r=\rho(p)$; that is to say that $T_p F$ is a complex plane. Question. Why does $T_p F = \ker \alpha_r$ at critical points $p$? Isn't the following a counterexample? Example. Let $V$ be the affine plane $\{(\tfrac{1}{2},t,0,s) \in \mathbb{C}^2\}$ and $F=V \cap B_1$. Then $\rho\mid_F$ is Morse with a unique critical point at $(\tfrac{1}{2},0,0,0)$. For condition (2), we note that $F$ intersects $S_{1/2}$ in the above critical point and $S_{1/2+\epsilon}$ in a circle parametrized by $\gamma(t)=(\tfrac{1}{2},t,0,\sqrt{\epsilon^2+\epsilon -t^2})$. To evaluate $\alpha_{1/2+\epsilon}$ on $F \cap S_{1/2+\epsilon}$, we use the definitions $z=x_1+iy_1$ and $w=x_2+iy_2$ to write $\eta$ as $x_1 \, dy_1 - y_1 \, dx_1 + x_2 \, dy_2 - y_2 \, dx_2$.

1336588,"If $a^b=c^d$, then $c$ and $a$ are powers of the same number?","I want to know in which situations two numbers that can be expressed as powers can be equal. I think it's intuitive that if two powers (say $a^b$ and $c^d$) are equal, then the bases must be themselves powers of a single natural number (say $a=m^k$ and $c=m^l$, so that $m^{kb}=m^{ld}$, and $kb=ld$). But I'm having a hard time proving it. My approach is as follows: I factor $a$ and $c$ into prime factors and write the equation $a^b=c^d$ as:
$$\left({p_1}^{a_1} {p_2}^{a_2} \cdots {p_n}^{a_n}\right)^b=\left({p_1}^{c_1} {p_2}^{c_2} \cdots {p_n}^{c_n}\right)^d$$
(where $p_1=2$, $p_2=3$, $p_3=5$, etc are the prime numbers) which turns into the following system:
$$a_1 b = c_1 d \\ a_2 b = c_2 d \\ \vdots \\ a_n b = c_n d$$

Assuming that the mdc's are $1$, I want to prove that the vectors for $a$ and $c$ are equal . I don't where to go from here. I can do it in the case that the mdc's are pairwise $1$, that is, $\mathrm{mdc}\left\{a_1,a_2\right\}=\mathrm{mdc}\left\{a_1,a_3\right\}=\cdots=\mathrm{mdc}\left\{a_{n-1},a_n\right\}=1$, but not in the general case.","['perfect-powers', 'gcd-and-lcm', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'divisibility']"

Because $p$ and $q$ have no common factors, the only way $\frac {p^2} {q^2}$ can be whole is if $q^2=1$. (4) Therefore, $F!-1=p^2$. (5) Note that $F!-1$ is a form of $3k-1$. (6) No square can equal any $3k-1$.  A number is either $3j-1$, which squared becomes $3m+1$; or $3j$, which squared becomes $3m$; or $3j+1$, which squared becomes $3m+1$.  Thus, no square can equal any $3k-1$. (7) Therefore, $F!-1$, being a form of $3k-1$, cannot equal $p^2$, which is a direct contradiction to (4).

1336883,Sets of Divergence for Fourier Partial Integals,"It is a consequence of Carleson's theorem together with a transference argument that (see Section 4.3.5 in L Grafakos, Classical Fourier Analysis for proof) that the Fourier partial integrals of a function $f\in L^{p}(\mathbb{R})$ , where $1<p\leq 2$ , converge pointwise almost everywhere (a.e.) to $f$ : $$\lim_{R\rightarrow\infty}\int_{\left|\xi\right|\leq R}\widehat{f}(\xi)e^{2\pi i\xi x}\mathrm{d}\xi=f(x)\quad \text{a.e.} \tag{1}$$ Kahane and Katznelson showed that given any subset of the torus $E$ of measure zero, there exists a continuous periodic complex-valued function $f\in C(\mathbb{T})$ such that the Fourier partial sums of $f$ diverge at every $x\in E$ (and possibly at other points too). My question is whether there is an analogoue of Kahane's and Katznelson's result for continuous, $p$ -integrable functions on the real line. A cursory search has been unable to find one. Question. Given a subset $E\subset\mathbb{R}$ of measure zero, does there exist a continuous function $f\in L^{p}$ with locally integrable (distributional) Fourier transform $\widehat{f}$ , such that $$S_{R}f(x):=\int_{\left|\xi\right|\leq R}\widehat{f}(\xi)e^{2\pi i\xi x}\mathrm{d}\xi \tag{2}$$ diverges for all $x\in E$ ? I think this question makes sense as its written. I know that, unlike in the setting of the torus, the Fourier transform of a function $f\in L^{p}(\mathbb{R})$ isn't necessarily a function, if $p>2$ . But I think I have taken care of that issue by requiring the Fourier transform to be locally integrable so the integral in (2) makes sense. My motivation for this question stems from the problem of inverting the Fourier transform $\widehat{f}$ using the cutoff function $\chi_{[-R,R]}$ (see this question ), when $f\in L^{1}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\widehat{f}$ is only assumed to be locally integrable. How badly can the equality in (2) fail if $\widehat{f}\notin L^{1}(\mathbb{R})$ ? Edit 1. I incorrectly stated Kahane and Katznelson's result in the original question. They only showed that given a measure zero subset $E\subset\mathbb{T}$ , the partial Fourier sums diverge on $E$ and possibly at other points as well. It's not necessarily the case that $S_{N}f(x)\rightarrow f(x)$ for all $x\notin E$ . In fact, characterizing the sets $E$ for which $S_{N}f$ diverges on $E$ and converges on $E^{c}$ appears to be an open problem . Also, it cannot be the case that $S_{N}f(x)\rightarrow a\in\mathbb{C}$ , where $a\neq f(x)$ . The Fejer means $\sigma_{N}f(x)$ of the partial sums converge to $f(x)$ at every point of continuity of $f$ , whence everywhere. So if the partial sums converge, then it must be to $f(x)$ .","['fourier-series', 'fourier-analysis', 'harmonic-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

First he finds dense open subschemes $X_1 \subseteq X$ and $Y_1 \subseteq Y$ along with $F: X_1 \rightarrow X$ and $G: Y_1 \rightarrow Y$, whose composition in either order is the identity where it is defined. 
Then he defines for $n>1$, $X_{n+1} = F^{-1}(Y_n)$ and $Y_{n+1} = G^{-1}(X_n)$.
In this case, we have $G \circ F |_{X_2} = id_{X_2}$ and $F \circ G |_{Y_2} = id_{Y_2}.$
Let $X_{\infty} = \cap_{n \geq 1} X_{n}$ and $Y_{\infty} = \cap_{n \geq 1} Y_{n}$. He claims that
$X_2 = X_{\infty}$ and $Y_2 = Y_{\infty}$, from which it follows that $F$ and $G$ define maps between $X_2$ and $Y_2$. These are inverse maps and we are done.

$$
\int_{\mathbb R} e^{-\mu x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}(T-\tau)}\exp{\left(\frac{-(x-a)^2}{2(T-\tau)} \right)}dx

Since $d\phi(x)=\frac{dx}{\cos(\arcsin(x))}=\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$ we get: $$\int_{\pi/4}^{\pi/2}\frac{1}{\sin(x)}dx=\int_{1/\sqrt{2}}^{1}\frac{1}{x\cdot \sqrt{1-x^2}}dx.$$ Suddenly the integral becomes improper, which feels somehow 'wrong' to me.

I hope someone of you can help me to eliminate my 'uncomfortable' or 'wrong' freeling about this situation, for -as the calculation shows- the situation is quite natural.

1337526,Transfer Matrix Method to determine the generating function,"Let $G = (V,E,\Phi)$ be a weighted directed graph and $\mathcal{W}' : E \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ the weighting. Let additionally $m = \# V$, $E_m$ the $m \times m$ identity matrix. Let $v,w \in V$ be in a fixed order in $V$ so $v$ is the i -th and $w$ the j -th element of $V$. Then applies $$f_{vw}(x) = (-1)^{i+j} \det((E_m - xA)^{(j,i)}) / \det(E_m-xA).$$ Example : Let $L$ be the set of all words over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$ that no not contain ""bb"". The following unique finite state-machine with the start state $S = q_0$ and final states $T = \{q_0,q_1\}$ accepts exactly these language: we now use a weighting $W'(e) = 1$. The matrix of the graph is given by
  $$\mathcal{A} = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}  1 & 1 \\
                   1 & 0 
\end{array}
\right) 
$$
  while the first row and column relate to the node $q_0$ and the second row and column to the node $q_1$. Then applies for $f_L(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0} \sum_{w \in L \atop |w| = n} x^n$ that $f_L(x) = f_{q_0q_0}(x)+f_{q_0q_1}(x)$.
  Because of $$\det(E_2-Ax) = (1-x)-x^2$$  we get using the the transfer-matrix-method (see definition above) $$f_{q_0q_0}(x) = (-1)^{1+1} \det((E_2-Ax)^{(1,1)})/\det(E_2-Ax) = 1/(1-x->x^2).$$ 
  $$f_{q_0q_1}(x) = (-1)^{1+2} \det((E_2-Ax)^{(2,1)})/\det(E_2-Ax) = (-1) \cdot (-x)/(1-x-x^2).$$ 
  Therefore applies
  $$f_L(x)=f_{q_0q_0}(x) +f_{q_0q_1}(x) = \frac{1+x}{1-x-x^2}.$$ Exercise Let $g_n$ be the amount of words of the length $n$ over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{a,b,c\}$ that contain max two b's.

1337531,Combining Fubini and Tonelli's in one single Assumption,"I am referring to the statements on Wikipedia , there it is said that Fubini's Theorem states that if $f : X\times Y \to \mathbb R$ is integrable, then
$$
 \int_X \left( \int_Y f(x,y) dy\right) dx = 
 \int_Y \left( \int_X f(x,y) dx\right) dy =
 \int_{X\times Y} f(x,y) d(x,y)
$$
and for Tonelli's Theorem instead of supposing integrability, we just assume $f$ to be non-negative $f \ge 0$, and then the above equalities hold. Then later it is written that Fubini and Tonelli could be combined, meaning that if one of the following conditions
\begin{align*}
 \int_X \left( \int_Y |f(x,y)| dy\right) dx & < \infty \\ 
 \int_Y \left( \int_X |f(x,y)| dx\right) dy & < \infty \\
 \int_{X\times Y} |f(x,y)| d(x,y) & < \infty
\end{align*}
hold, then the above formula for interated integrals is valid. I do not understand in what sense this entails Tonelli's condition of non-negativity? For example take $f(x,y) = \max\{0, x\}, X = Y = \mathbb R$, then Tonelli's Theorem applies, and all integrals have value $\infty$, but none of the above mentioned integrals is finite, so I think this condition does not incorporate Tonelli's Theorem??","['analysis', 'measure-theory', 'integration']"

To be honest, this exercise confuses me a little because, as I understand, each pair of homeomorphic spaces is homotopy equivalent by construction. On the other hand, the existence of bijective continuous mapping between spaces automatically provides their homeomorphism (correct me if I'm wrong). Thus, in this logic, if we have two continuous bijections between topological spaces this will inevitably lead to the homotopy equivalence between them. I guess, however, that there is a simple counterexample related to the discrete topologies which breaks such a reasoning (see, for example, this: Is a bijective homotopy equivalence with bijective homotopy inverse a homeomorphism? ), but I have certain difficulties in discovering it.

E[(X-E[X|Y])^4]& \le (E[X^4]^{1/4}+E[E^4[X|Y]]^{1/4})^4 \\
