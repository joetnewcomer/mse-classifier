4815423,Convergence of series where $\alpha$ gets close to 1 periodically?,Its known that $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^\alpha}$$ converges with $\alpha > 1$ . But how does something like $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{k^{2-sin(k)}}$$ behave that gets close to 1 periodically? The usual tests for convergence failed. Interestlingly I tried this logarithmic convergence criteria I found on german wikipedia. I states that if the series $$b_k=\frac{ln(k^{sin(k)-1})}{ln(ln(k))}$$ converges to something stricly smaller that $-1$ the series converges. Now i pluged this into wolframalpha and it outputs $-\infty$ . But looking at the step-by-step soltion it seems to make a mistake. It applies the product rule for limits wrong IMO.,"['calculus', 'analysis', 'sequences-and-series']"
4815470,Proof of Kolmogorov's $0$-$1$ Law in Shiryaev,"I know this theorem has been discussed in a lot of posts on this site however I was unable to find an answer that deals with the particular proof I am trying to understand. I'm interested in the proof of Kolmogorov's $0$ - $1$ law given in the book "" Probability by Albert Shiryaev "". The statement is as follows, Theorem: Let $\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots$ be a sequence of independent random variables and let $A \in \cap_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n^{\infty}$ , i.e an element of the tail $\sigma$ -algebra. Then $\mathbb{P}(A)=0$ or $1$ . We define $\mathcal{F}_n^k = \sigma(\xi_n,\xi_{n+1},\ldots,\xi_{k})$ with the convention $\mathcal{F}_n^{\infty}=\sigma(\xi_n,\xi_{n+1},\ldots)$ . Proof: Clearly we have $A \in \mathcal{F}_1^\infty=\sigma(\xi_1,\xi_{2},\ldots)=\sigma(\cup_n \mathcal{F}_1^n)$ . We can find sets $A_n \in \mathcal{F}_1^n$ , $m\geq1$ , such that $\mathbb{P}(A \Delta A_n) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ . Hence, $$\mathbb{P}(A_n) \to \mathbb{P}(A), \quad \mathbb{P}(A_n \cap A) \to \mathbb{P}(A) .$$ But as $A \in \cap_{n=1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n^{\infty}$ , the events $A_n$ and $A$ are independent for every $n \geq 1$ . Hence it follows that $\mathbb{P}(A)=\mathbb{P}(A)^2$ , which completes the proof. Now first of all I presume the $m$ is a typo and this should be an $n$ . The only issue I'm having with this proof is the claim that you can approximate the event $A$ by an event in $\mathcal{F}_1^n$ , and by approximate I mean in the sense of the pseudo metric defined by the symmetric difference operation. Shiryaev has an exercise in a previous chapter which he refers to in this proof that says given a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ and an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ such that $\sigma(\mathcal{A})=\mathcal{F}$ , for any $B \in \mathcal{F}$ and $\epsilon>0$ there exists a set $A \in \mathcal{A}$ such that, $$\mathbb{P}(B \Delta A) \leq \epsilon. $$ In the proof above the set in which we are taking the $A_n$ 's are one, not necessarily an algebra as unions of $\sigma$ -algebras need not be an algebra and secondly they do not even generate the $\sigma$ -algebra that $A$ belongs to, i.e $\mathcal{F}_1^\infty$ . So my question is why we can apply this result ? Just to be 100% clear the proof is transcribed correctly, i.e the possible typo of $m\geq1$ does appear in the book.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"
4815477,Cohomological implications of Twisting by Effective Nef Divisors,"It is a standard result due to Serre that for a projective scheme $X$ , $D$ an ample divisor on $X$ , and $F$ a coherent sheaf, there exists an $N$ such that for all $n\geq N$ , one has $H^0(X,F\otimes O_X(nD))\neq 0$ (or better yet, $F\otimes O_X(nD)$ is generated by global sections). In particular, Serre gave a cohomological criterion for ampleness. I ask a similar question for nef line bundles $O_X(D)$ , but with some added conditions to study how far off $D$ is from being ample. I require $D>0$ i.e. it is effective so as to rule out the trivial bundle. Under this hypothesis, is the following property true? Let $D$ be a nef and (numerically?) effective divisor. Then $H^0(X,F\otimes O_X(nD))\neq 0$ for $n\gg 0$ and any coherent sheaf $F$ . I've looked at Lazarsfeld's books and nothing came up. Certainly, there are consequences for cohomology for big and nef divisors such as Kawamata-Viehweg Vanishing and Lazarsfeld's book is riddled with such consequences. These are not what I am searching for. As another example, big divisors themselves have the property that $h^0(X,F\otimes O_X(nD))\geq Cn^{\dim X}$ for $n\gg 0$ and for any coherent sheaf supported on all of $X$ and where $C>0$ is a constant. So my question is a weaker form of this.",['algebraic-geometry']

4815567,"Is there a ""hidden"" product-rule in every derivative?","This is a very quick question, and it might be pretty basic. But as a preface, I plan to dive into the actual proofs behind the derivative rules after this post, but I would like to see if my intuition is correct here first! I was toying around with derivative rules, and I had the thought that, no matter what form your function is in, you will be performing the product rule ! For example, if you want to take a derivative of the function $f(x) = x^2\times sin(x)$ , you would apply the product rule and get $\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = 2x\times sin(x) + x^2\times cos(x)$ This is an obvious use of the product rule , but I think that there is a less obvious use of the product rule when taking the derivative of $f(x) = x^2$ . The derivative is simple, if we use the power rule we get: $$\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = 2x$$ And this is done with the formula $\frac{d}{dx} [x^n] = nx^{n-1}$ . But I am positing that there is a ""hidden"" product rule being performed as well! Because if we think about it, there is still multiplication taking place with the $x$ in $f(x) = x^2$ , this is shown in the ""expanded"" version of: $$f(x) = 1\times x^2$$ And you cannot just skip over the product rule ! So in taking the derivative of this function we are actually performing a combination of the power rule and product rule : $$\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = 0\times x^2 + 1\times 2x$$ which is implicitly done with the output of the power rule alone, so this is why we do not show the product rule in action here. This is my own intuition based on what I have learned so far, and I am curious if I am correct, or making dangerous assumptions!",['derivatives']
4815615,What's the hypersolid angle of a 5-cell (4d tetrahedron)?,"It's known that the solid angle of the vertex of a regular tetrahedron is $\arccos(\frac{23}{27})$ , or equivalently, $\frac\pi2-3\arcsin(\frac13)$ or $3\arccos(\frac13)-\pi$ . (Trig identities are weird.) This is around $0.551$ steradians, or around $0.044$ times the whole sphere. What about the same question but one dimension higher? The 4d equivalent of the tetrahedron is known as the 5-cell, also called the 4-simplex. What is the hypersolid angle of the regular 5-cell? I managed to write some Python code that approximates the solid angle, shown below. It does so by choosing a random point in $\Bbb R^5$ using a spherically symmetric distribution (the normal distribution was easiest) and checking to see if the all coordinates were above average but the last one. The odds of success was then multiplied by the surface volume of the hypersphere (which is $2\pi^2$ ) to convert to cubic radians. (You can check that the equivalent code one dimension down gives the correct answer for the tetrahedron.) This code is very slow (it takes a minute or two to run) and not very accurate, but it was the best I could think of. The final verdict is that it's around $0.192$ or $0.193$ cubic radians. import numpy as np

many = 10_000_000
count = 0
for i in range(many):
  vec = np.random.normal(size=5)

  f"" hypersphere, or {round(2*np.pi**2*result,3)} radians^3."") The solid angle of a 5-cell is 0.01 of the full hypersphere, or 0.193 radians^3. I tried Googling for the answer but couldn't find anything. Since it's not readily available online, I'm guessing that it might not even have a closed form. If that's the case, I would be satisfied with a numerical answer, to perhaps 10 digits or so.

4815624,Test if a finite group is a symmetric group algorithmically,"Suppose $G$ is a finite group with $|G|=n!$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Suppose that we have the entire Cayley table of the group stored and we can perfom multiplication in the group as fast as it takes us to perform a lookup in the table. What's an efficient algorithm to test whether $G \cong S_n$ ? I.e. it returns true if $G \cong S_n$ , false otherwise. Any group theoretic object or property we may wish to find (e.g. abelianness, the centre of the group, the orders of elements, the conjugacy classes...) are all programmed in. If desired, suppose we also have a group known as $S_n$ also within the program that we can compare to the group somehow. Here's what I've thought of so far. Iterating through all maps $G \to S_n$ to check if it is an isomorphism would be awfully slow, since there's $(n!)^{n!}$ such maps which obviously grows incredibly fast. We may be able to reduce this if we have nice methods to find all homomorphisms, or all bijections, or whatever else, but it'd still be incredibly large. We can rule out some groups quickly by checking certain things that are fast to compute and whether they match $S_n$ such as The abelianness of $G$ matches $S_n$ (i.e. $G$ non-abelian, unless $n = 2$ ) The sizes of conjugacy classes The orders of elements of the group The size of the center Etc. But this would be a necessary but not sufficient condition. So how can we improve on this?","['symmetric-groups', 'group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'algorithms']"
4815644,Confusion regarding the definition of the state of a physical system,"I'm currently covering Jan de Vries' Elements of Topological Dynamics and in it he gives a brief introduction to the field through the lens of classical mechanics. He defines the state of a mechanical system in the following way: In order to generalize his definition of state, as used in this paragraph, say to a physical system consisting of $n$ objects $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ , is it right to say that a system's state, at a particular time $t$ , can be represented by a tuple $$(x_1(t), \ldots, x_n(t), \dot x_1(t), \ldots, \dot x_n(t))$$ where $x_i(t)$ and $\dot x_i(t)$ are the position and velocity vectors, respectively, of object $p_i$ at time $t$ ? Here, if I've understood things correctly, the first $n$ components give information on the systems configuration while the latter $n$ components give information on the system's velocity (by giving the velocity of each of its constituents). If I've understood the above notion of state correctly (and please tell me if I haven't), I'm a little confused at the way he introduces the notion of a law of motion. He briefly introduced it in the former picture, but he finishes here in this image: Since he uses the notation $x(t) = (x_1(t), \ldots, x_n(t))$ to denote the state of a system, I'm assuming some of the components of this tuple are velocities and not everything is simply configuration. So, if $n = 2k$ (for $k$ the number of objects in our system), the family of autonomous ordinary differential equations he gives in $(5)$ can be written as $$\dot x_i(t) = F(x_1(t), \ldots, x_k(t), \dot x_1(t), \ldots, \dot x_i(t), \ldots, \dot x_k(t))$$ So, $\dot x_i$ is the output of a function with $\dot x_i$ itself as one of the input variables. Is this correct or have I mixed up the notation?","['physics', 'classical-mechanics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"

We consider $$\left(\sum_{cyc}\frac{1}{b+c+7a}\right)^2\cdot \sum_{cyc}(b+c+7a)(b+c)^3\ge 8(a+b+c)^3.$$ But $$ 8(a+b+c)^3\ge \sum_{cyc}(b+c+7a)(b+c)^3$$ is already wrong at $a=b=\dfrac{9}{10}.$ $\bullet$ Holder using 2 $$\left(\sum_{cyc}\frac{1}{b+c+7a}\right)^2\cdot \sum_{cyc}(b+c+7a)(x+a)^3\ge (a+b+c+3x)^3.$$ Choose $x$ such that equality holds at $a=b=2;c=0.$ Thus, we solve the equation $$4x^3+32(x+2)^3=(4+3x)^3\iff x=-4;x=-\frac{4}{3}. $$ Thus, both Holder using ways are failed.

4815683,Does every finitely presented group have a finite index subgroup with free abelianisation?,"Let $G$ be a finitely presented group. Does there exist a finite index subgroup $H$ such that its abelianisation $H^{\text{ab}} = H/[H, H]$ is free abelian? Note, if $G^{\text{ab}}$ is not already free abelian, then it is non-zero and surjects onto a non-trivial finite group, so $G$ admits a finite index subgroup. My motivation comes from compact manifolds. If $M$ is a compact manifold, then $\pi_1(M)$ is finitely presented and its abelianisation is $H_1(M; \mathbb{Z})$ which is a finitely generated abelian group which may have torsion. A finite index subgroup of $\pi_1(M)$ corresponds to a finite cover $N \to M$ . So my question above is asking whether I can take a finite cover $N$ of $M$ such that $H_1(N; \mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free. If $M = k\mathbb{RP}^2$ is a non-orientable surface, then $H_1(M; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}^{k-1}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_2$ . Its orientable double cover $N = \Sigma_{k-1}$ has $H_1(N; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}^{2k-2}$ which is torsion-free. This example shows that the rank of $H_1$ can change by passing to covers (in terms of groups, the rank of the abelianisation can change by passing to finite index subgroups). If $G$ is virtually free, then of course the answer is yes. Nilpotent groups also have the desired finite index subgroups, see this MO question . In this case, more is true. Namely, the finite index subgroup $H$ can be chosen so that $H^{\text{ab}}$ has the same rank as $G^{\text{ab}}$ .","['free-abelian-group', 'compact-manifolds', 'group-theory', 'covering-spaces']"

4815777,Is there a shape which maintains a constant surface area as it dissolves?,"Whether for hard candies, medicines, chlorine tablets, etc it seems that many applications would benefit from a 3D shape that maintains its surface area as it dissolves. Anton Petrunin's answer to the 2017 MathOverflow question ""Solids with constant surface area during 'erosion'"" suggested a sphere with a small hole drilled through the center. This is a pretty good answer as it transitions from an almost-sphere to a toroid by the end of its life (which maintains a high surface area even as its volume approaches zero). For a shape that remains a single, unbroken solid throughout, this is probably as good as it gets? But what if we relax that constraint and allow the shape to break into pieces as it dissolves? Is there some kind of fractal shape perhaps that might allow an even more consistent surface area as the shape dissolves? EDIT: We're still assuming uniform dissolving, so any material within epsilon of the outside will dissolve within delta_t, and the total time for the shape to dissolve shouldn't approach zero. EDIT2: Here's the sketch of an idea in 2D: The idea here is that the card will repeatedly split in half as it dissolves, due to the specially shaped holes that will fill with solvent. But I guess along with such ""hole filling"" and ""splitting"" there will always be discontinuities in the surface area over time (?), so it's impossible to hold the surface area truly ""constant""...

First: I don't understand what the $m+n-1$ should represent. Second: The answer says $m$ or less; shouldn't it be just less than $m$ ? since if were to have at least $n$ balls then the largest number of black balls we are to have is simply $m-1$ . Third: Overall as you've probably already noticed, I simply do not understand this solution whatsoever, for instance, why did we have to consider at least $n$ balls; shouldn't we just care about getting exactly $n$ balls before $m$ ?

4815822,"The two envelopes problem, only we know which envelope has the ""original"" amount","This problem is from Sheldon Ross's book, a first course in probability: Problem Body: A philanthropist writes a positive number $x$ on a piece of red paper, shows the paper to an impartial observer, and then turns it face down on the table. The observer then flips a fair coin. If it shows heads, she writes the value $2x$ and, if tails, the value $x/2$ , on a piece of blue paper, which she then turns face down on the table. Without knowing either the value $x$ or the result of the coin flip, you have the option of turning over either the red or the blue piece of paper. After doing so and observing the number written on that paper, you may elect to receive as a reward either that amount or the (unknown) amount written on the other piece of paper. For instance, if you elect to turn over the blue paper and observe the value $100$ , then you can elect either to accept $100$ as your reward or to take the amount (either $200$ or $50$ ) on the red paper. Suppose that you would like your expected reward to be large. Let $y$ be a fixed nonnegative value, and consider the following strategy: Turn over the blue paper, and if its value is at least $y$ , then accept that amount. If it is less than $y$ , then switch to the red paper. Let $R_y(x)$ denote the reward obtained if the philanthropist writes the amount $x$ and you employ this strategy. Find $E[R_y(x)]$ . Note that $E[R_0(x)]$ is the expected reward if the philanthropist writes the amount $x$ when you employ the strategy of always choosing the blue paper. My doubts: Now this is different from the usual envelope problem because we know which paper ""envelop"" has the original i.e. $x$ amount; so it's always beneficial to pick the blue paper. Concerning the $E[R_y(x)]$ ; I don't know how to calculate it for any $y, x$ ; that's because $x$ can be any positive number for example let's call the amount on the blue paper $b$ , if we have $y=1$ ; then for any $b$ if $b \geq y$ then we stay with the blue paper and if $b < y$ then we switch to the red paper; for each of those cases we can easily calculate the expected gain, the issue arises when I want to calculate the overall expected gain; that's because $0 < b \leq +\infty$ ; so it doesn't make sense to calculate the probability for $b \geq y$ and $b < y$ .

Can the triangle be divided by a straight line (that does not pass through any vertex) into two regions of equal sums? (That is, does there exist an $n$ such that Pascal's triangle with $n$ rows, without the $1$ s, can be divided by a straight line into two regions of equal sums?) For example, with $n=5$ , the red line below fails to divide the triangle into two regions of equal sums: the upper-left region has a sum of $58$ , and the bottom-right region has a sum of $56$ . I have tried to do this with different size triangles, without success. It seems that it cannot be done, but I don't know how to prove it. Remarks We exclude the $1$ s because the triangle with the $1$ s has a total sum of $2^n-1$ , an odd number, making an equal split obviously impossible. The sums of the all the terms in the first $n$ rows (not just one row) are given by A145654 (ignoring the initial $0$ ): $2,8,22,52,114,240,494\dots$ I considered the partial sums of a row of Pascal's triangle, but such expressions are not easy . I also tried to start with Pascal's triangle without the $1$ s and without the terms $\binom{n}{1}$ and $\binom{n}{n-1}$ , and I still couldn't split it. However, it is easy to split a triangle with terms $1*1\ 1*1\ 2\ 1*1\ 2\ 2\ 1*1\ 2\ 3\ 2\ 1$ (rows are separated by "" $*$ ""; in each row, numbers increase by $1$ up to a max, then decrease by $1$ .). I'm more interested in the method used to answer this question, than the answer itself. I've been trying to demystify Pascal's triangle, but it still mystifies me.

Till there nothing strange is the definition of diagonalization, but as far as I'm concerned there are multiple ways to define some application $g: V \to W$ with $\dim(V) = \dim(W)$ , and the representative matrix of $g$ is a square matrix. The question is: we want $f$ to be an endomorphism because otherwise there isn't nothing relevant to say even tough algorithmically speaking we could make the same eigenvalue/eigenvector calculation over any square matrix, or since $V,W$ have the same dimension are isomorphic as vector spaces and we are basically working with endomorphism? My guess is that the second reasoning could makes sense since (using the little bit of understanding I have of category theory) let $F$ be a $W,V$ isomorphism and $g:V\to W$ $$\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
V @>{g}>> W \\
@V{id_{V}}VV @V{F}VV \\

4815923,Can't understand how my solution is leading to double counting.,"We want to count all possible 8 coin tosses with at least 3 heads. I know two correct ways to solve this. One is to simply add up all individual cases of 3 heads, 4 heads and so on upto 8 heads. This results in $$\sum_{i=3}^n \binom{8}{i} = 219$$ . Another is to subtract the unwanted cases from all possible cases: $$2^8 - \binom{8}{0} - \binom{8}{1} - \binom{8}{2} = 219$$ . My (incorrect) reasoning is:
Choose 3 tosses out of eight to be heads, and assign heads or tails to the remaining 5 tosses. Leading to the expression: $$\binom{8}{3}\times 2^5 = 1792$$ This is absurd because it is bigger than the possible types of eight coin tosses namely $2^8=256$ . Clearly there is double counting.

4815958,Question about proof of Kolmogorov inequality for Bernoulli random variables,"The question is about one inequality which shows in Kolmogorov's paper ( inequality (3.1) ) but is not proved. The inequality says that, if we assume $Y_1,Y_2,\ldots$ are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with expectation $p$ , then the following inequality holds $$\mathbb{P} \left( \sup_{k\ge n} |\overline{Y}_k - p|\ge \varepsilon \right) \le 2 e^{-2 n \varepsilon^2 (1 - \varepsilon)} \qquad \text{for any $\varepsilon>0$,}$$ where $\overline{Y}_k = \sum_{j=1}^k Y_j / k = S_k / k$ .
To prove and improve this inequality, several people made contributions. However, I found I got lost when reading several steps in the proofs of these literature. Paper 1 discusses a general case where Bernoulli random variables are independent but not identical. However, in the 9th line of the proof of the Lemma 1 (key lemma), it seems that the inequality is contrary to the assumption ( $\phi_i^\varepsilon (t) \ge 1$ ). Without Lemma 1, we cannot get the inequality we want. Paper 2 improves the inequality proposed by Kolmogorov. However, Lemma 1 is also weird. First it cites Lemma 3 in paper 3 , but the definition of $\phi_\varepsilon (\lambda)$ (paper 2) and $\varphi_\varepsilon (\lambda)$ (paper 3) are different, with opposite sign before $\lambda$ . Despite this fact, both these two lemmas are strange. They say that: let $\varepsilon\ge 0$ , if there exists a $\lambda>0$ s.t. $\phi_\varepsilon (\lambda) = \mathbb{E} (e^{\lambda (X_i - \varepsilon)}) \le 1$ , then $$ \mathbb{P} \left( \sup_{k\ge n} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k Y_i}{k} \ge \varepsilon \right) \le \left[ \phi_\varepsilon(\lambda) \right]^n. $$ It is strange that the inequality is also true (trivial) if $\phi_\varepsilon (\lambda) > 1$ . We only needs to find that minimum of $\phi_\varepsilon(\lambda)$ when we fix an $\varepsilon$ . Then I checked the proof in paper 3 , especially the proof of Lemma 2. I did not find mistakes except one citation in the first line of the proof. It is a Russian book and we need theorem in page 183. In the proof, it defines a random variable $\eta (x) = \inf \{ i: 0\le i\le n, S_i \ge x \}$ . However, I did not understand the following inequality. $$ \mathbb{E} (e^{t S_n} \mid \eta(x) = k) \ge e^{tx} \mathbb{E}(e^{t S_{n-k}}). $$ I guess it uses the independence of $Y_i$ , but I think here we need conditional independence, and it is not true since $\eta(x)$ is defined by $Y_1,\ldots,Y_n$ . I truly wish you can give me some hints, no matter on whether this inequality is true, or on where I can find the correct proof, or on whether the ''mistakes'' I found is right. Thank you.

The specific definition of continuous functional calculus I'm exploring is as follows: Theorem 8.3 ( ""Quantum Theory for Mathematicians"" - Brian Hall): Let $A \in \mathcal{B}(H)$ be a self-adjoint operator. Then there exists a unique bounded linear map from $\mathcal{C}(\sigma(A); \mathbb{R})$ to $\mathcal{B}(H)$ , denoted as $f \mapsto f(A)$ , such that when $f(\lambda)=\lambda^{m}$ , we have $f(A)=A^{m}$ . This mapping, denoted as $f \mapsto f(A)$ , where $f\in \mathcal{C}(\sigma(A);\mathbb{R})$ , is commonly referred to as the (real-valued) functional calculus for the operator $A$ ."" My questions are mainly concerned with the choice of domain of $f$ : Why is the domain of $f$ restricted to $\sigma(A)$ (the spectrum of $A$ )? Why not simply use $\mathbb{R}$ as the domain, given that $A$ is self-adjoint and $\sigma(A) \subset \mathbb{R}$ ? In Halmos' book, for a polynomial $p(\lambda)=\sum_{j=0}^{n}\alpha_{j}\lambda^{j}$ and an operator $A$ on a Hilbert space, he defines $p(A)$ to be $p(A)= \sum_{j=0}^{n}\alpha_{j} A^{j}$ . To me, this seems acceptable, assuming that the domain and codomain of $p(A)$ and $A$ are the same. However, am I correct that when considering more complex functions like Borel or holomorphic functions, we need to be cautious about our choice of domain? Unfortunately, this aspect is not generally explained. Update :
The proof makes use of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, i.e. that polynomials are dense in $C(K;\mathbb{R})$ , where $K$ is a compact set. Thus we could use any compact $K \supset \sigma(A)$ . However, since $\sigma(A)$ is compact, we wouldn't gain anything as pointed out in the answers below.","['spectral-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'functional-calculus']"

In this context, I struggle to see the reason, wyh the following statement is false: $M(X)$ is weak*-compact. My reasoning:
According to Banach-Alaoglu the following set is weak*-compact: $$K:=\{\Lambda \in Y^* | |\Lambda(V)|\leq 1 \},$$ wherein $V$ denotes any neighborhood of zero. Choose the open unit-ball as $V$ then, clearly, every probability measure $\mu \in M(X)$ lies in $K$ . Hence, the set of probability measures is at least a subset of a weak*-compact set.
Further, if I have a sequence of probability measures which converge weakly to another measure $\delta$ , then I think one can directly show that $\delta$ itself is also a probability measure (using $\int f\mathrm{d}\mu_n \to \int f\mathrm{d}\delta$ for any $f \in Y$ ).
Therefore, I have almost proven that M(X) is a closed subset of a compact set - and therefore compact.

4816183,Radius of circle given horizontal distances of two points and angle between them,"Problem I'm not certain this is possible to solve (and indeed, if the answer is ""don't be silly, that's not possible"" then at the very least it'll save me some time!). I am attempting to find the radius $r$ of a circle on which I know the horizontal position of two points (relative to the center), $x_1$ and $x_2$ , and the angle between them, $\alpha$ . I realize this certainly won't be possible in all cases, e.g. when $\alpha$ is zero or any multiple of $2\pi$ then there's a single point and no possible solution, but I'm not sure it's possible even if $\alpha$ is not these things. Put simply: I know $x_1$ , $x_2$ , and $\alpha$ . I need to find $r$ . Things I've tried so far: using the Cosine rule on the isosceles $\triangle{{x_1}{x_2}O}$ to produce an equation for the base ( ${x_1}\to{x_2}$ ) in terms of $r$ and $\alpha$ , but of course while I know $\alpha$ I don't know the length of the base because I've only got the horizontal coordinates. Combining that with right-angle triangles dropped from $O$ proved fruitless, but perhaps I'm missing something here? Some searching on this site turned up numerous problems involving two points and a circle, but the closest I could find to my particular situation was ""calculating the radius of a circle if the distance between two points and the angle from the center are known"" , but of course in this case I don't know the distance between these points, precisely. Context A couple of years ago, I was watching Matt Parker put a ludicrous number of RGB LEDs on his Christmas tree . Being in possession of a similarly ludicrous number of RGB LEDs, and a micro-controller needed to drive them (plus some small skill in coding on Raspberry Pis, and their cameras), I decided I should attempt something similar with ours. I got the micro-controller, and the LEDs, and even a nice web interface going. However, the calibration of the 3D positions of the LEDs on the tree proved too much to do in my spare time that year. This year, I'm revisiting the problem. I've got to the point of a nice chunk of code (with web interface) that'll capture an image of the base tree (unlit), and an image of each LED lit in turn, at a series of arbitrary angles (specified by the user), calculating the positions of each LED as seen by the camera by diff'ing each capture to the (unlit) base capture. Hence, in the diagram above, $O$ is looking down the trunk of the tree. I can estimate (pretty accurately) its location based on an average of the horizontal positions of all LEDs found in the captured images. $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the horizontal positions of a single LED captured at two different tree angles, and we know $\alpha$ because it's literally input from the user (""how far did you turn the tree?""). Calculating the radius $r$ will give me the distance of the LED from the trunk. We only have the horizontal positions because the diagram above is us looking at the tree down its trunk. The camera in this case is placed in ""front"" of the tree, hence why I've extended the dotted lines down below the diagram towards the ""camera"" (and yes, I realize they're not technically parallel in practice, but ""good enough"" is fine here!). I did note that, though Matt doesn't go through his method of calibrating the positions of the LEDs (only the corrections post-calibration), he does mention that he rotated the tree through 90 degrees each time. This makes the problem much simpler: If the tree is always rotated through a right-angle, we can take advantage of the congruence of two right-angled triangles and note that: $$x_1 = r\cos{\alpha}\\
x_2 = r\sin{\alpha}\\
\frac{x_2}{x_1} = \frac{r\sin{\alpha}}{r\cos{\alpha}} = \tan{\alpha}\\
\alpha = \arctan{\frac{x_2}{x_1}}\\
r = \frac{x_1}{\cos{\alpha}}
$$ Job done! But that gives you a maximum of four possible positions of the tree, and it can be quite fiddly to reach one of those positions in our diminutive living room with all the LEDs hooked up. Hence, I'd really like to be able to have the user specify arbitrary rotations of the tree and capture whatever happens to be convenient / necessary for reasonable calibration of the points. Unfortunately, my trigonometric knowledge has been steadily gathering dust for 30 years, and something in my gut is mumbling that there's not enough data to solve this; that a hack like forcing the rotation to be right-angles is required. Am I barking up the wrong (Christmas) tree? Or just plain barking? I look forward to any (LED) light that you can shed! Alright, that's enough puns ...","['trigonometry', 'circles']"

4816225,Trouble understanding order statistics,"Order statistics were introduced in my text as follows: I am trying to understand what this means. $X_1 , \dots , X_n$ is a random sample, i.e. an independent and identically distributed sequence of random variables. $Y_1$ is the ""smallest"" of these $X_i$ . Do I interpret this as $Y_1 = \min \{ X_1 , \dots , X_n \}$ ? Then $Y_2$ is the second smallest of the $X_i$ when realized, $Y_3$ the third smallest, and so on until $Y_n = \max \{ X_1 , \dots , X_n \}$ ? An example to illustrate my thinking: Suppose we perform an experiment and the random variables $X_i$ are realized as $x_i = i$ (so $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2$ etc..). Then the random variables $Y_i$ are realized as $y_i = i$ as well because the $x_i$ are already in order. If we perform another experiment and the $X_i$ are realized as $x_i = -i$ (so $x_1 = -1, x_2 = -2$ etc..), then this time the variables $Y_i$ were realized as $y_i = -n + i - 1$ (so $y_1 = -n, y_2 = -n + 1, \dots , y_n = -1$ ). Is this the correction interpretation? My confusion/hesitation comes from the fact that these $X_i, Y_i$ are random variables and therefore functions instead of values and it's not really clear from the text what is meant by ordering them.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'order-statistics', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

However, I also tried a combinatorics approach but couldn't find any valid argument. My argument was as follows: Consider each $p_n(k)$ seperately. There are $n \choose k$ possibilities to choose $k$ fixed points and $n-k$ positions that should not contain fixed points. Now filling the gaps from begin to end, the first non-fix point position has $n-k-1$ possibilities ( $k$ taken + 1 is not allowed). The second position has $n - k - 2$ by the same logic, etc. In total we get: $$
p_n(k) = {n \choose k} (n-k-1)! 
$$ Now, for $k = n-1$ we automatically get $n$ fixed points by the pigeonhole principle. Therefore, we can exclude $k-1$ from our answer: $$
\sum_{k=0}^n k p_n(k) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} k p_n(k) = \left( \sum_{k=1}^{n-2} kp_n(k) \right) + n = n + \sum_{k=1}^{n-2} k{n \choose k} (n-k-1)!
$$ I then tried to show that $$
\sum_{k=1}^{n-2} k {n \choose k} (n-k-1)! = n! - n
$$ via induction but it doesn't work. For $n = 3,4$ the formula gives the correct result. Could anyone point out where the flaw in my logic is and maybe share a valid solution based on combinatorics.","['permutations', 'contest-math', 'fixed-points', 'combinatorics', 'problem-solving']"

4816336,How many connected nonisomorphic graphs of N vertices given certain edge constraints?,"Background: I’m helping a colleague with a theoretical problem in ecology, and I haven’t quite the background to solve this myself. However, I can state the problem clearly, I think: Problem statement: We’d like to enumerate and count (somehow) the number of connected, nonisomorphic graphs of $N$ vertices, where edges are categorized into three types, each representing a specific ecological interaction: Green represents a bidirectional Mutualism , where any pair of vertices may be connected and the order of vertices does not matter. Thus, $A \leftrightarrow B$ is always equivalent to $B \leftrightarrow A$ . Blue represents a directional Competition , with edges capable of pointing either way between any pair of vertices. Here, the order of vertices matters, and $A \rightarrow B$ is always equivalent to $B \leftarrow A$ , but sometimes $A \rightarrow B$ is equivalent to $A \leftarrow B$ under an isomorphism between two graphs. Red represents a directional Predation , with edges capable of pointing either way between any pair of vertices, exactly similar to Blue. Examples of isomorphisms for $N=3$ : $A \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Red}} B \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Red}} C \enspace\equiv\enspace A \mathop{\longleftarrow}\limits^{\text{Red}} B \mathop{\longleftarrow}\limits^{\text{Red}} C$ $A \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} B \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} C \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} A \enspace\equiv\enspace A \mathop{\longleftarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} B \mathop{\longleftarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} C \mathop{\longleftarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} A$ $A \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} B \mathop{\longleftarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} C \mathop{\longleftarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} A \enspace\equiv\enspace A \mathop{\longleftarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} B \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} C \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} A$ $A \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} B \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Red}} C \mathop{\longleftrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Green}} A \enspace\equiv\enspace A \mathop{\longleftarrow}\limits^{\text{Red}} B \mathop{\longleftarrow}\limits^{\text{Blue}} C \mathop{\longleftrightarrow}\limits^{\text{Green}} A$ Known answers for trivial values of N: For $N=1$ , there are 0 graphs satisfying the criteria, because there are no interspecies interactions, and the only graph is also unconnected. For $N=2$ , there are 3 graphs satisfying the criteria, one for each of the colored edges connecting the two vertices. Note that there aren’t 5, because 2 pairs of graphs are isomorphisms. ( $A \rightarrow B$ is an isomorphism of $A \leftarrow B$ for each color Red and Blue.) For $N=3$ , it gets a complicated fast, but it is known that there are 40 graphs satisfying the criteria. This has been verified both by hand enumeration with clear plastic cutouts and by a computer program to examine all candidates and exclude isomorphisms uncovered by simple flips and rotations. Beyond that, the problem becomes difficult to think about visually in a way that guarantees that all isomorphisms are found and eliminated. Even identifying all possible flips, twists, exchanges, and rotations of the graphs with $N=4$ is a bit of a challenge to get right in a hand-written program. I suspect a more general approach using graph theory, group theory, and/or combinatorics will lead to answers much more readily. Objectives: Primary Goal: We’d like to establish some formula (not necessarily in closed form) for computing the count, and be able to evaluate the formula for values of $N$ up to, say, 10, if possible. This might be accomplished with a computer program written in Mathematica or Haskell. Secondary Goal: We’d like to enumerate all connected non-isomorphic graphs with $N$ vertices (under the Green/Blue/Red edge conditions). Ideally, this would be an oriented incidence matrix that we could transform into input for Graphviz. This mathematical exploration aims to contribute insights into the dynamics of multi-species interactions in ecological systems. Advice from experts in graph theory, combinatorics, and group theory on how to approach this problem would be very helpful. Your guidance on tackling this mathematical challenge, along with strategies for creating a software program to achieve the primary or secondary goal, would provide valuable perspectives on ecological interaction modeling. Upper bound: We know trivially that the total count is bounded by $6^{T(N)}$ , where $T(N)={N(N-1)\over 2}$ , i.e., the $N$ th triangular number or the number of edges in a graph of $N$ vertices. The base of 6 here is due to there being six possible edge states: None, Green, Blue forward, Blue backward, Red forward, and Red backward. That part is trivial and easy; the hard part is excluding isomorphic redundancies, of which there are many. For example, for $N=3$ , the set of candidates is initially 216, but is quickly whittled down to 40 after removing non-connected graphs and coalescing isomorphisms.","['graph-isomorphism', 'graph-theory', 'number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'group-theory']"

4816641,Functional equation: $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f(n)^2 z^n$?,"Im looking for functions $f(z)$ such that $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f(n)^2 z^n = f(0)^2 + f(1)^2 z + f(2)^2 z^2 + f(3)^2 z^3 + ...$ and $f(n)$ are all real. And I wonder how fast $f(n)$ grows. I had this question in my head for a long time but I got reminded by these Function $f(x)$, such that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f(n) x^n = f(x)$ Does there exist a function that generates itself? and I am grateful to them. edit PROOF BY CONTRADICTION : infinite radius is not possible : Note $f(z)$ can not be a nonconstant polynomial.
This also implies that : $f(n) = 0 $ for all $n > N$ for some $N$ , cannot be true unless $f(z)=0$ . Also notice that the radius must be $\infty$ since $f(n)$ goes to infinity. So apart from the trivial constant functions, we are dealing with real entire transcendental functions. That implies that $f(n)^2$ converges to $0$ faster than exponential.
So it might make more sense to speak about how fast $\frac{1}{f(n)}$ grows. EVEN STRONGER : One can show that most $f(n)$ are not $0$ ; the tail of $f(n)$ must have no zero values, since all taylor coefficients are positive. And finally realize that therefore $f(1),f(2)$ must be nonzero, we can show that the start also can contain no zero's. So we end up with concluding that only $f(0)$ can be zero, what makes perfect sense since the function is strictly increasing on the positive reals. But now I run into a problem. Since $f(z)$ is strictly increasing , so is $f(n)$ . But strictly increasing $f(n)$ implies $0 < C < f(n)^2$ for some constant $C$ . Hence the radius is not infinite unless $f(z)$ is a constant !!! So we end up studying functions with finite radius, than can somehow get the real values $f(n)$ .
Analytic continuation around a pole or such might work.
Even lacunary series than can be extended might work. So the situation is not so clear and simple.","['functional-equations', 'complex-analysis', 'taylor-expansion', 'generating-functions', 'sequences-and-series']"

4816817,"Summing a nonstandard sequence, closed form of $S_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n x^{c^{i-1}}$","Arithmetic sequences have a common difference, where you add a constant to each term to get the next. Geometric sequences have a common ratio, where you multiply a constant to each term to get the next. Each one of these sort of sequences have a summation formula where you can sum the first $n$ terms without generating them. For an arithmetic sequence $(a_i)_{i=1}^n$ , we have $$\begin{align}
a+(a+d)+(a+2d)+\cdots+(a+(n-1)d) &= na+(1+2+\cdots+(n-1))d \\
&=na+\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2}d.
\end{align}$$ For a geometric sequence $(a_i)_{i=1}^n$ , we have $$\begin{align}
a+ra+r^2a+\cdots+r^{n-1}a &= s \\
ra+r^2a+r^3a+\cdots+r^{n}a &= rs\\
\phantom{d}&\\
\mbox{subtracting line 2 from line 1 gives us:}&\\
\\
r^na -a&= rs-s\\
(r^n-1)a &= (r-1)s\\
\\
\mbox{so, we get:}\\
\\
s &= \frac{r^n-1}{r-1}a
\end{align}$$ What if we take this to the next natural step. Instead of adding a constant to get the next term, as in an arithmetic sequence, or multiplying a constant to get the next term, as in a geometric sequence, you instead raise each term to a constant power to get the next term. So, you would have $$a,a^e,(a^e)^e,((a^e)^e)^e,\dots$$ or, more elegantly, $$a,a^e,a^{e^2},a^{e^3},\dots,a^{e^n}$$ for some constant $e$ . I feel like this would be called an exponential sequence, but that seems to be another name for a geometric sequence from google searches. I was playing with trying to make a summation formula for the first $n$ terms of such a sequence, and quickly realized I was stuck. I am sure others have played with such a sequence before, but I couldn't find anything online for similar sequences. Does anyone have any ideas for how to proceed with generating a summation formula? Note that I am not asking what the formula is - I want to derive it myself (this is just for fun), but I cannot find a good starting point. Thanks for any thoughts you all may have! -Andrew Edit: A user named Doug supplied a useful starting point on a comment that has since been deleted, suggesting an approach using partial sums. I wasn't able to look at it until late last night, and I spent a few hours working on it before I had to go to bed. Unfortunately, I got stuck in the weeds of the calculus on their approach, and since it is now gone I can't continue working on it. But, the starting point is sound I think. Note that I will be using $c$ as the constant power, instead of $e$ , because as users have pointed out, $e$ was a bad choice (Euler's constant). If we think of the sum as a finite power series $S_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n x^{c^{i-1}}$ , the question becomes finding a closed form of that finite power series. We notice that $$S_n(x^c)-S_n(x)=x^{c^n}-x$$ This gives us a starting point similar to that in finding the summation formula of a geometric series. Unfortunately, the left-hand side doesn't lend itself well to being written as a multiple of $S_n(x)$ .

4816868,Is the tensor product of W*-algebras commutative?,"According to definition 1.22.10 in Sakai's book if $\mathscr{N}$ and $\mathscr{M}$ are two W $^*$ -algebras its tensor product is defined by \begin{equation}
\mathscr{N} \overline{\otimes}\mathscr{M} := (\mathscr{N}_* \otimes_{min^*} \mathscr{M}_*)^*,
\end{equation} where $\text{min}^*$ is the dual projective norm and $\mathscr{N}_*$ , $\mathscr{M}_*$ are the corresponding predual spaces of $\mathscr{N}$ and $\mathscr{M}$ . What I would like to know if it is true that $\mathscr{N} \overline{\otimes}\mathscr{M} \cong \mathscr{M} \overline{\otimes}\mathscr{N}$ for this particular norm, that I will call W $^*$ -norm, . According to proposition II.9.2.6 in Blackadar's book when $\mathscr{N}$ and $\mathscr{M}$ are C $^*$ -algebras it is true that \begin{equation}
\mathscr{N} {\otimes}_{min \\ max} \mathscr{M} \cong \mathscr{M} {\otimes}_{min \\ max} \mathscr{N},
\end{equation} however, he does not prove this result and a similar property for the case of W $^*$ -algebras is not discussed. In order to prove this isomorphism of W $^*$ -algebras I started by defining the map \begin{equation}
s: \mathscr{N} \odot \mathscr{M} \to \mathscr{M} \odot \mathscr{N},  \sum_i n_i \odot m_i  \mapsto  \sum_i m_i \odot n_i, 
\end{equation} where $\odot$ denotes the algebraic tensor product; this map has an inverse given by \begin{equation}
s': \mathscr{M} \odot \mathscr{N} \to \mathscr{N} \odot \mathscr{M},  \sum_i m_i \odot n_i  \mapsto  \sum_i n_i \odot m_i. 
\end{equation} Now, the idea will be to prove that the map $s$ can be extended to an unique norm-preserving map in $\mathcal{B}(\mathscr{N} \overline{\otimes}\mathscr{M}, \mathscr{M} \overline{\otimes}\mathscr{N})$ ; for that I should prove that $s: \mathscr{N} \otimes_\alpha \mathscr{M} \to \mathscr{M} \overline{\otimes} \mathscr{N}$ is bounded where, $\otimes_\alpha$ is the W $^*$ -norm. Then, if the same is done for the map $s': \mathscr{M} \otimes_\alpha \mathscr{N} \to \mathscr{N} \overline{\otimes} \mathscr{M}$ then, I am almost done. However, I am failing to prove that the map $s$ is bounded. One thing I do know is that since $\alpha$ is a cross norm then $||s(m\otimes n)|| = ||m \otimes n||$ but this only works for simple tensors. So, I was wondering if there is any way I can bound these maps so they can be extended? Or perhaps, if there is another way to proceed to prove the isomorphism by using Sakai's language.

678 1 way ;
789 1 way . In case a), all the remaining 7 digits are no 0, so I counted: 7! x 12 = 60480 numbers
In all the other cases (30), from 7! I subtracted the cases in which the number begin with 0 (6! cases).

4817267,When are all normal subgroups of a direct product of finite groups a direct product of normal subgroups?,"Let ${G_1}$ and ${G_2}$ be finite groups. When are all normal subgroups of their direct product ${{G_1}\times{G_2}}$ the direct product of normal subgroups in ${G_1}$ and ${G_2}$ ? So when is it true that every normal subgroup of their direct product can be represented as ${{N_1}\times{N_2}}$ where ${{N_1}\lhd{G_1}}$ and ${{N_2}\lhd{G_2}}$ . I know this is true when ${G_1}$ and ${G_2}$ are finite groups of coprime order. But generally this isn't the case. For example $\langle (1,1) \rangle$ is a normal subgroup of $\mathbb{Z_2}\times\mathbb{Z_2}$ . However it cannot be represented in such a way.

4817296,Non-zero measure sets that are stable under composition,"Throughout this question when I talk about relations, I am referring to relations on $\mathbb{R}$ , i.e. subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ One of the first examples given when the topic of composition of relations is discussed, is that of the composition of a circle with itself. This is a circle: And this is what you get when you compose the circle with itself (if the circle were represented by the relation $C=\{(x,y):x^2+y^2=1\}$ , then this is $C\circ C$ ) So the circle is not stable under composition. And neither is the unit disc. The unit square however, is. Below is its graph: Another relation which is stable under composition is the diagonal, i.e. the relation $$D = \{(x,x)|x\in \mathbb{R}\}$$ And of course the entire $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Now we have already found one relation whose graph has non-zero finite measure, and which is stable under composition, namely the unit square. Are all such relations simply the unions of squares with their diagonals lying on the main diagonal? or is there some other non-trivial non-zero measure region which has this property?","['measure-theory', 'relations', 'function-and-relation-composition']"
4817311,On kernels and stalks of sheaves.,"Suppose we're given sheaves $F,G$ on a space $X$ and a morphism of sheaves (of abelian groups) $\phi:F\to G$ . I want to prove two things : the presheaf $\ker \phi$ , defined by $(\ker\phi)(U):=\ker(\phi_U:FU\to GU)$ is also a sheaf. $(\ker\phi)_p \simeq \ker(\phi_p)$ I can do 1. by actually procing the axioms for a sheaf with the presheaf $\ker \phi$ . But I know this should follow formally from the fact sheafification $\tilde{\,}:Psh(X)\to Sh(X)$ and the forgetful functor or inclusion $i:Sh(X)\to Psh(X)$ form a pair of adjoint functors, $\tilde{}$ being left adjoint to $i$ . Because then $i$ preserves limits, and kernels are limits but the precise way to conclude here isn't clear, writing it down is a bit awkward. So $\ker \phi$ is the limit of $F\rightrightarrows G$ (taken in the category of presheaves?) where the arrows are given by $\phi$ and $0$ . Saying $i$ commutes with limits, would mean $i (\lim F\rightrightarrows G )\simeq \lim iF\rightrightarrows iG$ but I don't know à priori that this limit is a sheaf, in fact this is what I want to prove so writing $i(\lim...)$ just doesn't make sense, this is I what I mean when I say the setup feels awkard. I have a similar issue with 2. : writing down an actual map giving the isomorphism is ok, but I feel like this should formally follow from the fact that the functor $_p$ ""stalk at $p$ "" is a filtered colimit and $\ker$ is a limit, these should commute. But I ran into similar issues, when writing it down. Any help would be deeply appreciated.","['limits', 'limits-colimits', 'category-theory', 'sheaf-theory']"
4817327,Concerns about the definition of Hawkes process,"In the lecture notes I am reading about Point process, when we introduced the Hawkes process several expressions are given and I have some difficulty to understand properly what is the $Z_t$ (defined below). I tried to make my doubts clear by precising two points w of concerns. Before I introduce the framework in order to fix notations. We consider $T_1<…<T_n<..$ the sequence of jump event with values in $\mathbb{R}^{2}_{+}$ and $\lambda(t)$ the intensity function at time $t$ . We define the poisson random measure (PRM) associated to the sequence of jump event by $$
M(\omega)(A)= \sum_{i\geq 0}\delta_{T_i(\omega)}(A),\quad A\in\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^{2})
$$ I will skip the $\omega$ in the sequel for the PRM. Now we define the set $$
A_t = \{ (x_1,x_2) : 0\leq x_1\leq t, 0\leq x_2\leq\lambda(x_1)\}
$$ By precising that $\lambda(t) = \mu + \sum_{n : T_n <t}h(t-T_n)$ with $\mu>0$ and $h :\mathbb{R}_{+}\to\mathbb{R}_{+}$ , we define the linear Hawkes process by $$
Z_t = M(A_t) 
$$ Then, I have two concerns : The justification of such equality $Z_t = \int_{[0,t]}\int_{0}^{\infty}1_{z\leq\lambda(s)} M(ds,dz)$ Indeed,I would like to start with the very definition of $Z_t$ that is with an integral over $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ since the PRM is a $2$ dimensional random measure : $$
Z_t = \int_{[0,t]\times[0,\lambda(s)]}M(ds,dz)
$$ But then I don’t know how to separate the integral in two since I cannot use Fubini in this context. How can I justify the passage from the integral above to $$
Z_t = \int_{[0,t]}\int_{0}^{\infty}1_{z\leq\lambda(s)} M(ds,dz)
$$ ? This makes me doubt about my comprehension of this $Z_t$ . The second concern is about the function $\lambda(t)$ . Indeed $h$ is defined on $\mathbb{R}_{+}$ so the expression $h(t-T_n)$ does not make sense since $T_n(\omega)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}_{+}$ ? This concerns me all the more as the following expression is often used $$
\int_{(0,s)}h(s-u)dZ_u = \sum_{ k : T_k < s} h(s-T_k)
$$ Which, for me until now, does not make sense given the definition of $T_n$ . If you have any answers that might help me, please don't hesitate! Thank you very much. $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2} = \{ (x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{2} : x\geq 0, y\geq 0\}$ After some thoughts concerning the second point, it may be possible to consider as the initial point process $X_k$ with values in $\mathbb{R}^{2}_{+}$ (for example a $2$ dimensional uniform law) and then define $$
T_k(\omega)= \pi_{1}(X_k(\omega))= x_1
$$ Where $X_k(\omega)=(x_1,x_2)$ . In order to have $$
\lambda(t) = \mu + \sum_{n : T_n <t}h(t-T_n)
$$ that is well defined. I don’t know if it is correct in that way but I think it avoids the confusion I highlighted above. Let me know what is your thoughts on this please.","['stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory', 'random-measures', 'point-processes']"

Here are some examples: In factorization theorem for a sufficient statistics $T(X)$ , he states $$ \frac{dP}{d\nu}=g_P(T(x)) h(x)$$ that $g_P$ depends on $P$ , but $h(x)$ does not. In the definition for ancillary statistic, he states that the distribution of that statistic does not depend on the population $P$ . I'm used to these definitions being given w.r.t. parameters.

Updates 1: Considering the counterexample in the answer given by @RyszardSzwarc, I updated my findings as follows: A- When $X, Y, Z$ are independent and have symmetric continuous distributions with unique medians , the above holds (still not sure about that this holds when $X, Y, Z$ are dependent). B- When the distributions of $X, Y, Z$ do not have unique medians, even if they are symmetric, the above may not hold. Specific questions: 1- If $X, Y, Z$ are independent and have distributions with unique medians , does the above hold? This can be written as follows: $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} F_Y(x)dF_X(x) \ge  \frac{1}{2}, \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} F_Z(y)dF_Y(y) \ge  \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} F_Z(x)dF_X(x) \ge  \frac{1}{2}.$$ Please provide a proof or counterexample. 2- What happens if the analysis of the above question is restricted to the class of distributions whose cdfs are continuous and strictly monotone over their supports (implying that the median is unique)? For a subclass of this class including those distributions with densities, the claim is equivalent to the following $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} F_Y(x)F'_X(x)dx \ge  \frac{1}{2}, \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} F_Z(y)F'_Y(y)dy \ge  \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} F_Z(x)F'_X(x)dx \ge  \frac{1}{2}.$$ Here, $F_X, F_Y, F_Z$ denote the cdfs of $X, Y, Z$ , respectively. $X, Y, Z$ have unique medians when $F_X(m_X)=F_X(m_Y)=F_X(m_Z)=0.5$ have unique solutions $m_X, m_Y, m_Z$ . Updates 2: Based on the counterexample provided by @stochasticboy321, I realized that the set of independent RVs with symmetric continuous distributions whose medians are unique is the only set of independent RVs over which the proposed probabilistic order is transitive. Note that based on the counterexample provided by @RyszardSzwarc we can design symmetric continuous distributions with non-unique medians for which the implication does not hold (the continuous version of $Y$ has a symmetric bimodal continuous distribution   with multiple medians). $\color{red}{\text{Prove, refine, or provide a counterexample:}}$ I guess this can be generalized to the set of all RVs with symmetric distributions whose medians are unique (including constants and symmetric distributions with unique medians) as The union of the set of real numbers and the set of RVs with symmetric continuous distributions whose medians are unique is the largest set of RVs over which the proposed probabilistic order is transitive. Here, $(X,Y, Z)$ is called to have a symmetric distribution if for some $m_1, m_2, m_3$ : $$(X-m_1,Y-m_2, Z-m_3) \sim - (X-m_1,Y-m_2, Z-m_3).$$ Updates 3: By the Bonferroni's inequality and $$\mathbb {P} (X \ge Z)\ge \mathbb {P} (X \ge Y , Y \ge Z)$$ we have $$\mathbb {P} (X \ge Y)\ge  p, \mathbb {P} (Y \ge Z)\ge  q \Rightarrow \mathbb {P} (X \ge Z)\ge  p+q-1.$$ Hence, to have a probabilistic order over the set of all RVs , $p=q=1$ seems to be the only choice for which $p=q=p+q-1$ .","['integration', 'statistics', 'real-analysis', 'order-theory', 'probability']"

Here is my attempt: Right away we can see that $f'(1)=f(1)$ from plugging in $x=1$ . But, this didn't really tell me anything, however I decided to keep this in mind for later. To make some actual progress we can see that $$\begin{align}f''(x)=\dfrac d{dx}f'(x)=\dfrac d{dx}f(1/x)\\=f'(1/x)\cdot\dfrac d{dx}\dfrac1x=-\dfrac{f(x)}{x^2}\end{align}$$ Therefore $$f''(x)=-\dfrac{f(x)}{x^2}$$ Now, we can set up 2 differential equations that our function must satisfy: $$x^2y''+y=0$$ and $$y'(1)=y(1)$$ I'll try solving our first one first: Plugging in $y=x^r$ ,we have $$x^2x^{r-2}(r^2-r)+x^r=0\\\implies x^r(r^2-r)+x^r=0\\x^r(r^2-r+1)=0\\\implies r^2-r+1=0$$ So solving our quadratic equation gets us $$r=\dfrac{1\pm i\sqrt3}2$$ We now let $$r_1=\dfrac{1+i\sqrt3}2,r_2=\dfrac{1-i\sqrt3}2\implies y=c_1x^{r_1}+c_2x^{r_2}$$ which we can write as [1] $$x^{r_1}=\sqrt x\left(\cos\left(\dfrac{\sqrt3}2\ln x\right)+i\sin\left(\dfrac{\sqrt3}2\ln x\right)\right)=z\sqrt x\\x^{r_2}=\sqrt x\left(\cos\left(\dfrac{\sqrt3}2\ln x\right)-i\sin\left(\dfrac{\sqrt3}2\ln x\right)\right)=\overline z\sqrt x$$ which is where I am currently stuck because I am unsure about what to do from here. So, my question is: Is $f'(x)=f(1/x)$ solvable, or am I doing math manipulations with no real meaning?

4817610,"Intuition for how the Fourier transform ""preserves information"" and ""changes basis""?","I am an undergrad that has taken a few courses in real and complex analysis. I am trying to understand the Fourier transform better at a level of abstraction somewhere between ""it moves from physical to frequency space"" and a graduate level that talks about things like ""Pointryagin dual spaces."" 1) (Preserving information) My current intuition for integral transforms comes from measure-theoretic probability. My thinking from scratch: I know the probability distribution of a random variable is essentially the ""measure assigned to all Borel sets,"" so it makes sense that knowing $E[f \circ X]$ for any measurable $f$ suffices to characterize the distribution of $X$ . This means knowing $E[X^k]$ for all integers $k$ suffices by polynomial approximation, and so moments characterize a distribution. Then since the exponential function is defined as a power series, the object $E[\exp( tX)]$ tells us the moments, and thus the distribution, of the rv $X$ , so a MGF characterizes a distribution. I later learned the MGF is sometimes called a ""Laplace Transform,"" so it makes sense that the Laplace transform preserves information. I also know the Fourier transform is the ""characteristic function"" of a random variable, but I'm not sure what the analog of the above explanation is for the characteristic function, and in particular the need for complex numbers here and the intuition for what their resulting interpretation (in the above sense) puzzles me. Of course, if you think of the naïve idea that the Fourier transform goes from ""physical to frequency space"" then it's obvious that it preserves information. But I am looking for an explanation in the sense given above. 2) (Change of basis) I have read the Fourier transform is a ""change of basis"" and I have also heard the fact that the exponential function is an eigenfunction of the Laplace operator, but I'm not sure how these two operators are related. In particular, I know the Fourier transform sends $\mathcal{F}: L_2 \to L_2$ , where that function space has a countable basis. So I would expect a ""change of basis"" to be something like $\hat{f} = \sum_i a_i \phi_i$ where $\phi_i$ are a basis set of functions for the space. But the Fourier transform involves an integral , not a sum, somehow implying an ""uncountable infinite basis"" if we view $\hat{f}(x) = \int f(t) \exp(-2\pi i x t) dt$ the values $f(t)$ as the co-efficients $a_i$ and the $\exp(-2\pi i x t)$ as the eigenfunctions.

Define the covariant functor $\text{Ab}:\text{Grp}\to \text{AbGrp}$ by sending objects $G\in \text{Ob}(\text{Grp})$ to $G/[G,G]\in \text{Ob}(\text{Ab})$ and morphisms $f \in \text{Hom}(G,H)$ to $f' \in \text{Hom}(\text{Ab}(G),\text{Ab}(H))$ by $f'([g]_G)=[f(g)]_H$ . The well-definedness of $f'$ can be easily checked. Since the free product is the coproduct in the category $\text{Grp}$ , it follows that for all groups $H$ and morphisms $f_\alpha:G_\alpha\to H$ , there exists a unique $f:\mathop{\Large *}_\alpha G_\alpha\to H$ such that $f \circ \iota_\alpha=f_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$ . Now, suppose $H$ is abelian. Then, Ab $(H)\simeq H$ . Now, take a family of morphisms $\{g_\alpha:\text{Ab}(G_\alpha)\to H\}$ , and define $f_\alpha:G_\alpha \to H$ by $f_\alpha(k)=g_\alpha([k]_G)$ for all $k \in G_\alpha$ . It can easily be checked that $\text{Ab}(f_\alpha)=g_\alpha$ . Using this family of functions $\{f_\alpha\}$ and abelian group $H$ , one can take the above coproduct setup and apply the Ab functor to everything. This yields the following: For all abelian groups $H$ and morphisms $\{g_\alpha:\text{Ab}(G_\alpha)\to H\}$ , there exists a unique function $\text{Ab}(f):\text{Ab}(\mathop{\Large *}_\alpha G_\alpha)\to H$ such that $\text{Ab}(f)\circ \text{Ab}(\iota_\alpha)=g_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$ . However, this is exactly the definition of the coproduct of $\text{Ab}(G_\alpha)$ in the category AbGrp, and since the direct sum is the unique coproduct in the category AbGrp, it follows that $\text{Ab}(\mathop{\Large *}_\alpha G_\alpha)\simeq \bigoplus_\alpha \text{Ab}(G_\alpha)$ . Is this line of reasoning correct?","['category-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'solution-verification', 'abelian-groups']"
4817802,Please criticize my attempted proof of a simple set theory lemma.,"I am reading Terrence Tao's analysis 1 and am new to writing proofs. I'm currently financially unstable and have no one to talk about math's with, so any criticm would help me so much. In his book, I was asked to prove the following statement: Let X, Y be sets. Define a partial function from X to Y to
be any function f : X' → Y' whose domain X' is a subset of X, and whose
range Y' is a subset of Y. Show that the collection of all partial functions
from X to Y is itself a set. (Hint: use Exercise 3.4.6, the power set axiom, the
replacement axiom, and the union axiom.) All of the ZFC axioms of set theory except the axiom of choice are allowed to be assumed to prove this statement. A set is considered by terrence tao at that stage of the book, and collection of mathematical object that satisfies all of the set theory axioms except the axiom of choice. (Power set axiom). Let X and Y be sets. Then there exists a set, denoted Y X, which consists of all the functions from X to Y, thus
f ∈ Y X ⇐⇒ (f is a function with domain X and range Y). Axiom 3.11 (Union). Let A be a set, all of whose elements are themselves sets. Then there exists a set UA whose elements are precisely
those objects which are elements of the elements of A, thus for all objects x
x ∈ UA ⇐⇒ (x ∈ S for some S ∈ A). (Replacement). Let A be a set. For any object x ∈ A, and
any object y, suppose we have a statement P(x, y) pertaining to x and
y, such that for each x ∈ A there is at most one y for which P(x, y) is
true. Then there exists a set {y : P(x, y) is true for some x ∈ A}, such that for any object z, z ∈{y : P(x, y) is true for some x ∈ A}
⇐⇒ P(x, z) is true for some x ∈ A. Ex 3.4.6 :
Lemma 3.4.9:
Let X be a set. Then the set
{Y : Y is a subset of X}
is a set.
Proof. See Exercise 3.4.6. My attempted proof: Let X and Y be sets. {A | A is a subset of X} is a set by lemma 3.4.10, let P(X) = {A | A is a subset of X} {A | A is a subset of Y} is a set by lemma 3.4.10, let P(Y) = {A | A is a subset of Y} Let y be any subset of Y, i.e let y ∈ P (Y). For each x ∈ P (X), there exists a unique set denoted by yx , which consists of all functions f, f:x -> y. Also, for any object z, let P(x,z) be the property pertaining to x and z := “ z = yx ”. By the replacement axiom, we have that {z | z = yx for any x ∈ P (X)} is a set, for each subset y of Y. For each y ∈ P (Y), there exists one set {z | z = yx for any x ∈ P (X)} as previously established. Also, for any object z, let P(y,z) be the property pertaining to y and z := “ z = {z | z = yx for any x ∈ P (X)}”. By the replacement axiom, we have that {z | z = {z | z = yx for any x ∈ P (X)} for each subset y of Y} is a set. Let A = {z | z = {z | z = yx for any x ∈ P (X)} for each subset y of Y}. By the axiom of union, we have ⋃ A is a set, such that x ∈ ⋃ A ⇐⇒ (x ∈ S for some S ∈ A), which is equivalent to x ∈ ⋃ A ⇐⇒ x is some function from a subset of X to a subset of Y. Any help is appreciated.Also if you want to rewrite it to be proper that would help me learn also. Thank you so much for your time.","['elementary-set-theory', 'logic']"
