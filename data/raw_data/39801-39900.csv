390875,Is there a classification of isolated essential singularities?,"In the thread Why do we categorize all other (iso.) singularities as ""essential""? , here is one of the questions that was asked: Do we not care about essential singularities to classify them further? The accepted answer for this question addresses this as follows: So all essential singularities have some things in common, but on the other hand this should not lead us to believe that they are all the same. What they have in common is complicated behaviour, but they can be complicated in very different ways! Indeed, different transcendental entire functions (those that have an essential singularity at infinity; i.e. are not polynomials) can vary very much with respect to their behavior near infinity. Just for example, for some such functions, such as $z\mapsto e^z$, there exist curves tending to infinity on which the function is bounded, while for others this is not the case. I see that essential singularities can be very different, but perhaps there can still be a classification. Here is how I would state my question: If we say that functions having an isolated essential singularity at $0$ are equivalent when they differ by multiplication by a non-vanishing holomorphic function, is there a nice or fundamental set of representatives of this equivalence relation? More formally: Let $\mathcal{S}$ (for ""singularity"") be the set of germs of functions at $0$ that are holomorphic except for an isolated essential singularity at $0$; in other words, let $\mathcal{S}$ be the quotient of 
  $$\left\{(f,U)\,\middle\vert\, \begin{array}{c}
U\subseteq\mathbb{C}\text{ is a neighborhood of }0,\\ f\colon U\to \widehat{\mathbb{C}}\text{ is holomorphic on }U\setminus\{0\},\\
f\text{ has an essential singularity at }0\end{array}\right\}$$
  by the usual equivalence relation for germs. Let $\mathcal{I}$ (for ""invertible"") be the set of germs of holomorphic functions at $0$ that are non-vanishing in a neighborhood of $0$; thus, for any $[f]\in \mathcal{I}$, we also have $[1/f]\in\mathcal{I}$. Multiplication of germs at a point is well-defined, so we have a map $\mathcal{I}\times\mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{S}$; it is in fact a group action. Is there a nice or fundamental set of representatives for the orbits of this action? Very naively, I might guess that a set of representatives is given by $e^{1/f}$ for holomorphic functions $f$ vanishing at $0$, together with any function obtainable from these by repeated composition with $e^z$ (thus, for example, $e^{e^{1/z}}$), but I don't know how I would go about determining whether this is correct. P.S. I'm pretty weak with complex analysis; explanations assuming little background knowledge would be very welcome.","['singularity-theory', 'complex-analysis']"

390918,Showing that smoothing operators are compact,"Suppose I have a bounded, linear map $T: H^1(X) \to H^1(X)$ such that $T(H^1(X)) \subset C^\infty(X)$. Is $T$ a compact operator? I'm guessing this depends on whether or not $X$ is (pre)compact, and in the case I am the most interested in, it is ($X$ is an open, bounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$), but I am also curious about the general question. My preliminary thoughts are Arzela-Ascoli: if we take a sequence of functions $f_n \in H^1(X), ||f_n||=1$, then $||Tf_n|| \leq ||T||$ so the sequence is uniformly bounded. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how I should translate the smoothness of $Tf_n$ (and compactness of $X$) into equicontinuity. Or maybe this follows directly from something like Rellich's theorem or another Sobolev embedding result? EDIT: Let us further refine the problem statement, so that $T$ is a bounded, linear map $H^1_0(X) \to H^1_0(X)$ that extends to a continuous map $\mathcal{E}'(X) \to C^\infty(X)$ (assumptions on $X$ to follow, $\mathcal{E}'$ are compactly supported distributions). Is $T$ compact? Thoughts: if $X$ is an open, bounded set, then the Schwartz kernel theorem says that there exists $k \in C^\infty(X \times X)$ so that 
$$
Tf(x) = \int k(x,y)f(y) \ dy.
$$ If $k$ is uniformly continuous, then equicontinuity essentially follows immediately. But uniform continuity doesn't necessarily hold, as $X$ is only pre-compact. If we replace $X$ by $\overline X$, then obviously a smooth $k$ on $\overline X \times \overline X$ is uniformly continuous, but does the Schwartz kernel theorem still hold in this case (every map $T:\mathcal{E}'(\overline X) \to C^\infty(\overline X)$ corresponds to a unique, smooth integral kernel)?","['sobolev-spaces', 'compact-operators', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
390920,Annulus Theorem,"I'm trying to read Rolfsen's ""Knots and Links"" and I'm a little discouraged that I can't do one of the first and seemingly more important exercises.  The question is Use the Schoenflies theorem (every topological imbedding $S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is the boundary of a 2-disk) to prove the annulus theorem: Given two disjoint imbeddings of $S^1$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where one is ""inside"" the other (I.e. one is in the bounded component of the complement of the other), then the space ""between"" the two curves is homemorphic to $S^1 \times [0,1]$. There is a hint that says ""connect the two curves with arcs"".  Unfortunately I can't say much about ""what I've tried."" At this point in the book, we know only that all simple closed curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $S^2$ are ""equivalent"" in the sense that there exists a homeomorphism of the ambient space taking one to the other.  This allows us to assume one of the curves is the standardly imbedded $S^1$. After that I'm totally unsure of what to do. I would appreciate any hints or advice.

how about $d_n = (a_n+b_n)/2$,

390992,How to verify the order of DOPRI Runge-Kutta method?,"I've written code in Fortran based on the RK8(7)-13 method by Dormand and Prince to solve the system $\mathbf{y}'=\mathbf{f}(t,\mathbf{y})$. The method is Runge-Kutta 8$^\text{th}$ order with an embedded 7$^\text{th}$ order method; I want to verify that the error on the output agrees with this. For a method of order $p$ and timestep $h$, we expect the local truncation error to be $\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$. Therefore, if I advance the program by one time step and calculate $\text{error} = |y_{\text{RK}}-y_{\text{exact}}|$ (say I know $y_{\text{exact}}$) and plot $\log(\text{error})$ vs. $\log(h)$ for several values of $h$, the slope of the line should be 9. Here's the problem: it isn't. I've tried simple polynomials like $f(t,y) = 1$ and $f(t,y) = 2t$, but the slope of the line always seems to be between 1 and 2; this is also the case for $f(t,y) = y$. However, for $y'' + y = 0$ (which translates into the coupled system $\mathbf{f}(t,y_{1}, y_{2}) = (y_{2}, -y_{1})$), I found that the slope is almost exact 9 for larger values of $h$ - for small values the slope goes back to ~1. Furthermore, the magnitude of the error is $~10^{-20}$ for this small $h$. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas as to what the issue could be. My ideas: I've been misinformed as to what order means, and the method I've described is not representative of the order of the RK scheme. This is entirely possible, but the fact that one of the slopes was 9 seems too coincidental. Something to do with precision. This could explain why the small $h$ values have unreliable errors since I'm ""only"" carrying 30 digits of precision, but this wouldn't explain the disagreement for the polynomial $f$. Something specific to RK methods that I'm unaware of. I'm hoping it's this. Programming error. I'm hoping it isn't this. Mistake entering in the Butcher table. I'm really hoping it isn't this. Side note: I've also tried plotting the global error as a function of $h$, but the results were even stranger, so I think the problem may be more fundamental.","['runge-kutta-methods', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'numerical-methods']"

391313,Deriving the 37-percent rule for dating,"I am trying to prove the theoretical ""37-percent rule"" for dating.  The setup, if I remember correctly, is this.  Suppose that you will meet exactly $N$ potential mates in your life, and you will meet them one at a time, in a perfectly random order.  The potential mates rank from best to worst (in a total ordering), and you want to maximize the probability that you end up with the best one.  However, you can only tell how good the mates are relative to each other , so while you can fully rank the people you've already met, you can't say anything about the ones you have yet to meet.  Also, for each potential mate, you can either stay with them forever or leave forever, i.e. there is no divorce or post-breakup dating. The result I have heard, and which I am trying to prove, is that your best strategy is to wait and reject the first 37% of them ($1/e$, to be precise), and then marry the next one that is better than all you have previously met .  The $1/e$ number presumably arises as the limit as $N \to \infty$. Obviously, you should never marry someone who isn't strictly better than all the previous ones, because then your chances of picking the right one are $0$.  Also, given a strategy that you wait through the first $K$ partners and then marry the next one that is the best so far, I calculate your expected chances of succeeding as
\begin{equation}
\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{M = K}^{N-1} \frac{M - 1 \choose K-1}{N - M}}{N \choose K}
\end{equation} (Let $M$ be the maximum value among the first $K$ people you meet, where $1$ is the value of the worst person, $2$ is the next, and so on, with your desired mate having value $N$.  Given $M$, your chances of winning are $\frac{1}{N - M}$, because the value $N$ must be the first to appear out of the highest $N - M$ values.  The chances of the maximum being exactly $M$ are ${M - 1\choose K - 1}/{N \choose K}$.) (The above formula doesn't technically work for $K = 0$, but the reasonable convention ${-1 \choose -1} = 1$ gives the desired value $\frac1N$.) The two things I am unable to prove, and which I would like to see ideas for, are: Given that you never pick someone unless they are the best so far, how do you prove further that the best strategy must involve waiting for some $K$ people and then going for anyone else after that $K$?

391693,proof of the Krull-Akizuki theorem (Matsumura),"This set of questions refers to the proof of the Krull-Akizuki theorem given in Matsumura's Commutative Ring Theory, pages 84-85. For those who don't have the text, i will provide the details. The Krull-Akizuki theorem reads as follows: Let $A$ be a one-dimensional Noetherian integral domain with field of fractions $K$ , let $L$ be a finite algebraic extension of $K$ , and $B$ a ring with $A \subset B \subset L$ ; then $B$ is a Noetherian ring of dimension at most 1, and if $J$ is a non-zero ideal of $B$ then $B/J$ is an $A$ -module of finite length. The proof starts by proving the following Lemma: Let $A$ and $K$ be as in the theorem, and let $M$ be a torsion-free $A$ -module of finite rank $r$ . Then for nonzero $a \in A$ we have $l(M/aM) \le r \cdot l(A/aA)$ , where $l(\cdot)$ is the length function. Proof of Lemma: First assume that $M$ is finitely generated. Choose elements $\xi_1,\cdots,\xi_r \in M$ linearly independent over $A$ and set $E=\sum A\xi_i$ ; then for any $\eta \in M$ there exists $t \in A$ with $t\neq0$ such that $t \eta \in E$ ... ...If we set $C=M/E$ then from the assumption on $M$ we see that $C$ is also finitely generated, so that $t C=0$ for suitable nonzero $t \in A$ ...we can find $C=C_0 \supset C_1 \supset \cdots \supset C_m=0$ , such that $C_i/C_{i+1} \cong A/p_i$ with $p_i \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ . Now $t \in p_i$ , and since $A$ is one-dimensional each $p_i$ is maximal, so that $l(C)=m < \infty$ ... Question 1: What exactly is the role of $t$ in showing that $l(C) < \infty$ ? It seems to me that since $A$ Noetherian and $C$ is finitely generated by construction, we obtain directly the chain $C=C_0 \supset \cdots \supset C_m=0$ , with $C_i/C_{i+1} \cong A/p_i, p_i \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ (this is essentially theorem 6.4). From this chain and the fact that each $A/p_i$ is a field, we get that the length of $C$ is finite. What am i missing? Question 2:Further down in the proof of the theorem, the proof shows the existence of an element $a_0 \in J \cap A$ . How do we deduce from this that $l(B/J) \le l(B/a_0B)$ ? If $B,J$ are finite, then i can see that $l(B/J)=l(B)-l(J) \le l(B) - l(a_0B)=l(B/a_0B)$ . But we don't know a priori this finiteness condition.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Similarly, for any category $C$, if $X$ is an object of $C$, then the full subcategory of objects isomorphic to $X$ is a proper class (ie, there are LOTS of them)? EDIT: Let me elaborate a bit. I'm not entirely sure if I should be considering ZFC or ETCS, etc. I'm asking this question from the point of view of algebraic geometry and its use of category theory. I mean, I know people say that the class of say, all elliptic curves over $\mathbb{C}$ is a proper class, but the class of $\mathbb{C}$-isomorphism classes of elliptic curves is a set. That would seem to imply that every isomorphism class is a proper class, and hence this would seem to say that the isomorphism class (ie, bijection class) of the empty set in the category of sets should also be a proper class, right? Lana's answer with the extensionality axiom seems to make sense, in that there is only ONE empty set, so that the isomorphism class of the empty set is a singleton set. On the other hand, the isomorphism class of a set with 1 element should be a proper class right? Generalizing a bit, would it be true that the isomorphism class of any initial (or terminal) object of a category be a singleton set? It seems to me that the isomorphism class of, say $\text{Spec }\mathbb{Z}$ in the category of schemes is a proper class, simply because there are many different presentations of rings isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$? will","['category-theory', 'elementary-set-theory']"

391792,Probability of rolling $n$ successes on an open-ended/exploding dice roll,"I'm trying to compute the probability of achieving a certain number of successes when rolling a die pool for both open-ended/exploding and closed tests. Success is defined as a roll above a certain (variable) threshold. If a roll is open-ended, any die which rolls the maximum value triggers an additional die to be rolled. This is for a role-playing game (Burning Wheel Gold). Assume the use of a $n$-sided die. Additionally, we assume $d$ to be the number of dice, $r$ to be the required number of successes, and $c$ to be the minimum value accepted as a success. I'm breaking the question down into two blocks: one for open-ended rolls, and one for closed rolls. Closed roll: For closed rolls, we can define a probability recurrence as follows: $$Pr\left[r,d\right] = \begin{cases} \\1-\frac{c}{n}:Pr\left[d-1,r\right]\\\frac{c}{n}:Pr\left[d-1,r-1\right] \end{cases}$$ With probability $\frac{c}{n}$, a success will be met. However, I'm not sure how to solve this recurrence relation for any number of dice/required successes. There's probably an easier way to do this, but I haven't done much discrete probability. Edit: It looks like a binomial probability distribution works for this part of the problem. This comes in the form of: $${{d}\choose{r}}\left(\frac{c}{n}\right)^{r}\left(1-\frac{c}{n}\right)^{d-r}$$ Open ended roll: For open-ended rolls, we can find the equivalent number of rolled dice. This is going to be equal to: $$d+\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{d}{6^{j}} \right)=\frac{6d}{5}$$ This implies that, given a number of dice $n$, rolling open-ended results in approximately $\frac{6}{5}n$ dice rolled. If we had an easy way to solve the above for any number of dice $n$, it would be easy: we could just input the non-integer value $n$ and get our result. However, since the above is defined with a recurrence relation is a binomial distribution, and thus uses combinations, it won't work for a non-integer number. Thus, we can define a probability recurrence relation as follows: $$Pr\left[ r,d\right] = \begin{cases} \\1-\frac{c}{n}:Pr\left[d-1,r\right]\\\frac{c-1}{n}:Pr\left[d-1,r-1\right]\\\frac{1}{n}:Pr\left[d,r-1\right] \end{cases}$$ The probability of no significant result is $1-\frac{c}{n}$, the probability of a regular success is $\frac{c-1}{n}$, and the probability of an 'exploding' or open-ended result is $\frac{1}{n}$. However, I don't know how to solve this recurrence relation, either. So these are my questions: For closed rolls, how do I find the probability of $n$ successes? I've looked at existing probability tables (PDF), but they don't actually contain the math for their generation, and it's non-intuitive to discern from the table. Edit: See above; the binomial formula applies. For open rolls, can the closed roll formula be applied to a non-integer number $\frac{6n}{5}$? Edit: No. See above; the binomial formula uses combinations, thus requires integer numbers. So, how do I solve the closed roll recurrence relation and/or find the open probability?","['dice', 'recurrence-relations', 'probability']"

391902,How to work with random variables?,If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables described by standard normal distribution could you please explain how to formally evaluate probabilities of occurrences such as $X-Y>0$ (intuitively it's $0.5$ of course) or $X^2-Y^2>0$? Ultimately I'd like to be able to tell how likely is it that parabola $z(t)=X^2+2Yt+t^2$ has a root in positive semi-axis of $t$.,['probability']
391915,Projecting a surface segment of a cone onto a 2D plane?,"Firstly, I'd like to apologise - I do not know the correct terms for what I am asking. Assume that the top/bottom of the highlighted portion there is actually aligned with the base. To help explain:
I need to wrap that section of the cone using a piece of paper. What shape (exactly) do I need to cut out from said paper so that it will wrap flawlessly?",['geometry']
391917,Is there a general algorithm to find a primitive element of a given finite extension (with a finite number of intermediate fields)?),"I just want to know if there is an algorithm to find the primitive element of a given finite extension $F/k$ if the intermediate fields are given. I know how to approach it in particular examples picking linear combinations (the case $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})/\mathbb{Q}$ for instance). If it does not exists, is there, then, an algorithm for the finite separable extension case or for extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$? Thanks in advance.","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
391921,Field of fractions of a finite $\mathbb{Z}$-module is finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$,"Let $A$ be a ring which is also a finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$ -module. If $A$ is an integral domain and $K$ is its field of fractions and $K$ has characteristic zero, then why is $K$ a finite dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$ ? I see that $K$ contains $\mathbb{Q}$ but why is the extension finite?","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
391929,$i^{th}$ root(s) of unity,"If we define $S:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:z^n=1\}$ (i.e. the $n^{th}$ roots of unity), then $|S|=n$ (i.e. we have $n$ of them). We can even go as far as to say: $$S=\{z_k:k\in\mathbb{N}\cap[1,n]\}=\{e^{2\pi i/k}:k\in\mathbb{N}\cap[1,n]\}$$
Plotting these points on an Argand diagram shows the above point, namely that the plot looks symmetric across the real axis, and has rotational symmetry order $n$. It follows that, if we let $n\to\infty$, the plot of points tends towards being a circle centred on the origin, radius $1$. But $z^i$, and even $z^{1/i}$, are both (possibly) well-defined ideas, so can we talk about the $i^{th}$ roots of unity? How many of them are there? What geometric interpretation is there when we talk about them, and can we analogously look at the $2i^{th}$ roots, etc.? I know that $z^{1/i}:=e^{(1/i)\log{z}}$, so $z^{1/i}=1$ means that we search for solutions to $(1/i)\log{z}=0 \Rightarrow \log{z}=0$. I guess a similar question is: what geometric/insightful interpretation is there to the fact that $i^i=e^{(-\pi+4k)/2}$ (for $k\in\mathbb{Z})$? Edit: turns out that I can't multiply things by $0$ correctly... mistake fixed, thanks.","['geometry', 'complex-numbers', 'geometric-interpretation']"
