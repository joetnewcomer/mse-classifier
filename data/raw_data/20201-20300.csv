170183,Uncountable disjoint union of $\mathbb{R}$,"I'm doing 1.2 in Lee's Introduction to smooth manifolds: Prove that the disjoint union of uncountably many copies of $\mathbb{R}$ is not second countable. So first, let $I$ be the set over which we are unioning. Then I believe the disjoint union is just $\mathbb{R}\times I$. Then I believe that sets of the form $\cup_{x\in A}(x,i)$ is open if and only if $A\subset\mathbb{R}$ is open (I know the open sets are defined with the canonical injection though). At first I thought if I let $I=\mathbb{R}$, then $\mathbb{R}\times I=\mathbb{R^2}$, but now I am thinking maybe they just have the same elements, but the topology is different, and this is why $\mathbb{R}\times I$ is not second countable?","['general-topology', 'manifolds', 'differential-topology']"

170207,Some method to solve $\int \frac{1}{\left(1+x^2\right)^{2}} dx$ and some doubts.,"First approach. $\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx=\frac{x}{1+x^2}+2\int \frac{x^2}{\left(1+x^2\right)^2} dx=\frac{x}{1+x^2}+2\int \frac{1}{1+x^2}dx-2\int \frac{1}{\left(1+x^2\right)^2}dx$ From this relationship, I get: $2\int \frac{1}{\left(1+x^2\right)^2}dx=\frac{x}{1+x^2}+\int \frac{1}{1+x^2}dx$ Then: $\int \frac{1}{\left(1+x^2\right)^2}dx=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{x}{1+x^2}+\arctan x\right]+C$ This is a recursive solution. Second approach. $x=\tan t$ in $t\in (- \pi/2, \pi/2)$, i.e. $t=\arctan x$, then $dx=(1+x^2) dt$. $\int \frac{1}{\left(1+x^2\right)^2}dx=\int \frac{1}{1+x^2}dt=\int \frac{\cos^2t}{\sin^2t+\cos^2t}dt=\int \cos^2t dt=\frac{1}{2}\int \left(1+\cos 2t \right) dt=\frac{t}{2}+\frac{1}{4}\sin 2t$ This result can be rewritten (using trigonometric formulas): $\frac{t}{2}+\frac{1}{4}\sin 2t=\frac{t}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sin t \cos t$ From $\cos^2 t=\frac{1}{1+x^2}$, I have: $|\cos t|=\sqrt{\frac{1}{1+x^2}}$ but in $t\in (- \pi/2, \pi/2)$, $|\cos t|=\cos t$. So: $\cos t=\sqrt{\frac{1}{1+x^2}}$. Now I have a problem: $|\sin t|=\sqrt{\frac{1}{1+x^2}}$, but $|\sin t|\neq \sin t$ for $t\in (- \pi/2, \pi/2)$. Any suggestions, please? This integral can be solved in other ways? Thanks.","['calculus', 'integration']"
170215,"Solving ODEs: The Frobenius Method, worked examples","I find the Frobenius Method quite beautiful, and I would like to be able to apply it. In particular there are three questions in my text book that I have attempted. In each question my limited understanding has stopped me. Only one of these questions (the last) is assigned homework. The rest are examples I found interesting*. 1) $ L[y] =  xy'' + 2xy' +6e^xy = 0 $ (1) The wikipedia article begins by saying that the Frobenius method is a way to find solutions for ODEs of the form $ x^2y'' + xP(x) + Q(x)y = 0 $ To put (1) into that form I might multiply across by x, giving me $ x^2y'' + x[2x]y' + [6xe^x]y = 0 $ (2) But is that OK? The first step in the method seems to be dividing by $ x^2 $, so can't I just leave the equation in its original form? I'll assume I can. Now we let $ y_1 = \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^{r+n} $ then, $ y_1' = \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} (r+n)a_nx^{r+n-1} $ and, $ y_1'' = \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} (r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-2} $ substituting into (2) we get, $ x\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}(r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-2} + 2x\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}(r+n)a_nx^{r+n-1} + 6e^x\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^{r+n} = 0 $ But now what? I am aware that $ 6e^x = 6\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}x^n/n! $, but my powers stop there. Can I multiply the two series together? I would have to multiply each term in one series by every term in the other, and I don't know how to deal with that. The text provides no worked examples in which P(x) or Q(x) are not polynomials... so for now my work stops here. 2) $ L[y] = x(x-1)y'' + 6x^2y' + 3y = 0 $ Again, I will leave the question in its original form, rather than try to get that x^2 in front (I realise I am not checking that the singular point is a regular singular point, but checking the answer in the back of the book, x = 1 and x = 0 are indeed regular points). With two regular singular points, I expect I will get 2 sets of answers: one near x = 1 and the other near x = 0. Is it enough to just proceed with one case and then the next? I will assume so, and begin with the case close to x = 0. Again, letting $ y_1 = \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^{r+n} $, and taking the appropriate derivatives, we find by substitution, $ x(x-1)\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}(r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-2} + 6x^2\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}(r+n)a_nx^{r+n-1} + 3\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^{r+n} = 0 $ $ x^2\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}(r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-2} - x\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}(r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-2} + 6x^2\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}(r+n)a_nx^{r+n-1} + 3\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^{r+n} = 0 $ $ \sum _{n=0}^{\infty}(r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n} - \sum _{n=0}^{\infty}(r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-1} + \sum _{n=0}^{\infty}6(r+n)a_nx^{r+n+1} + \sum _{n=0}^{\infty}3a_nx^{r+n} = 0 $ we shift the indexes of the above sums, so that everything will be in terms of the same power of x. $ \sum _{n=1}^{\infty}(r+n-1)(r+n-2)a_{n-1}x^{r+n-1} - \sum _{n=0}^{\infty}(r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-1} + \sum _{n=2}^{\infty}6(r+n-2)a_{n-2}x^{r+n-1} + \sum _{n=1}^{\infty}3a_{n-1}x^{r+n-1} = 0 $ we synchronise the indexes in order to group like terms, by extracting early terms from each series, $ r(r-1)a_0x^r + \sum _{n=2}^{\infty}(r+n-1)(r+n-2)a_{n-1}x^{r+n-1} - r(r-1)a_0x^{r-1} - r(r+1)a_1x^r - \sum _{n=2}^{\infty}(r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-1} + \sum _{n=2}^{\infty}6(r+n-2)a_{n-2}x^{r+n-1} + 3a_0x^{r-1} + \sum _{n=2}^{\infty}3a_{n-1}x^{r+n-1} = 0 $ rearranging, we get $ r(r-1)a_0x^r - r(r-1)a_0x^{r-1} - r(r+1)a_1x^r + 3a_0x^{r-1} + \sum _{n=2}^{\infty}(r+n-1)(r+n-2)a_{n-1}x^{r+n-1} - \sum _{n=2}^{\infty}(r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-1} + \sum _{n=2}^{\infty}6(r+n-2)a_{n-2}x^{r+n-1} + \sum _{n=2}^{\infty}3a_{n-1}x^{r+n-1} = 0 $ At this point I expect the indicial equation to emerge, and I expect it to be similar to an Euler Equation. That is, I expect a polynomial that I can solve to get two 'exponents at the singularity'. Unfortunately, I cannot see an indicial equation and am at a loss to know precisely why. 3) $ L[y] = xy'' + y = 0 $ Finally we come to the assigned question, which I have been able to manipulate into an almost final form. Again, letting $ y_1 = \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^{r+n} $, taking derivatives, and substituting into L, we get $ x\sum _{n=0}^{\infty} (r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-2} + \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^{r+n} = 0 $ $ \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} (r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-1} + \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^{r+n} = 0 $ Now shifting indexes, $ \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} (r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-1} + \sum _{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n-1} x^{r+n-1} = 0 $ and extracting the $ 0^{th} $ term of the first sum, $ r(r-1)a_0x^{r-1} + \sum _{n=1}^{\infty} (r+n)(r+n-1)a_nx^{r+n-1} + \sum _{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n-1} x^{r+n-1} = 0 $ $ r(r-1)a_0x^{r-1} + \sum _{n=1}^{\infty}[(r+n)(r+n-1)a_n + a_{n-1}]x^{r+n-1} = 0 $ And voila! We have an indicial term with solutions $r_1 = 1$ and $r_2 = 0$, and a recurrence relation. From my text I expect that $y_1 = |x|^{r_1}[1+\sum _{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n]$ and since $ r_1 - r_2 \in \mathbb{Z} $, $y_2 = ay_1ln|x| + |x|^{r_2}[1 + \sum _{n=0}^{\infty}b_nx^n]$ to find $a_n$ we observe the recurrence relation with $ r = r_1 = 1 $, $ (r+n)(r+n-1)a_n + a_{n-1} $ $ a_n = -a_{n-1}/n(n+1) $ so, $ a_1 = -a_0/2*1 $ $ a_2 = -a_1/2*3 = a_0/3*2*1*2*1 = a_0/3!2! $ $ a_3 = -a_2/3*4 = -a_0/4!3! $ and in general, $ a_n = (-1)^na_0/n!(n+1)! $ so we have $ y_1 = |x| + \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^na_0x^{n+1}/n!(n+1)! $ Not so easily done with r = r_2 = 0, I'm afraid... since the relation becomes $ a_n = -a_{n-1}/n(n-1) $, which means we can't have a_1 for fear of division by zero. Never the less, starting at n = 2 we get, $ a_2 = -a_1/2*1 $ $ a_3 = -a_2/2*3 = a_1/3*2*1*2*1 = a_1/3!2! $ $ a_4 = -a_3/3*4 = -a_1/4!3! $ and in general, $ a_n = (-1)^{n-1}a_1/n!(n-1)! $ so we have $ y_2 = ay_1ln|x| + 1 + \sum _{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1}a_1x^{n+1}/n!(n-1)! $ Which I feel may not be correct... and even if it is, how should one man solve for a in a single lifetime? Thanks everyone for looking at this. I want to stress that I am not just a student looking for help in his homework: I would really like to understand this method because it appeals to me. I particularly like the way we extract the indicial expression from the sums, in order to synchronise them. That is so cool. And how you get 1 recurrence relation that you can use for both solutions: neat. PS sorry if my Latex is not perfect?

170274,Center of a ring isomorphic to endomorphism ring of identity functor,"I am having trouble verifying the following (this is self-study): There is an isomorphism between the center of a ring $A$ and the ring of endomorphisms of the identity functor of the category of (right) $A$-modules. The map $\Psi\ \colon Z(A) \to \mathrm{End}(1_{Mod\ A})$ sends
$a \in Z(A)$ to multiplication by $a$ (let's write $\Psi(a) = \theta^{a}$).
This poses no trouble. It seems reasonable to define the inverse map
$\Xi\ \colon \mathrm{End}(1_{Mod\ A}) \to Z(A)$ as sending
$ \eta \in \mathrm{End}(1_{Mod\ A})$ to $\eta_A(1)$, since
from this we readily get
$\Xi \circ \Psi (a) = \Xi(\theta^a)=\theta^{a}_{A}(1)=1a=a$. However I can't see why $\Psi \circ \Xi = 1_{\mathrm{End}(1_{Mod\ A})}$.
Unfolding, we have to prove that
$\Psi \circ \Xi (\eta) = \theta^{\eta_A(1)} = \eta$, that is, for any right $A$-module $L$, we need to have $\theta^{\eta_A(1)}_L = \eta_L$.
I'm at a loss on this. I tried to find the right components on which to use
naturality (that's how I succeeded to prove that $\eta_A(1)$ does lie in $Z(A)$,
which wasn't obvious to me from the outset), but to no avail. Some googling led me to this blog post by Q. Yuan (see the ""sub-example"") where the direction of the map $\Xi$ is deduced from the fact that $A$ is a generator of $\mathrm{Mod}\ A$. However I can't quite see explicitly why (in the perspective adopted there, I believe this is just rephrasing the issue I'm having) the lifting of a central element to an endomorphism of $1_{\mathrm{Mod}\ A}$ is inverse to the composition of the two isomorphisms with the natural injection $\mathrm{End}(1_{\mathrm{Mod}\ A}) \to Z(\mathrm{End}_A(A))$.","['ring-theory', 'category-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Anyone know how to prove convergence and find the limit? I had another proof based on using Riemann sums, but I am looking for another proof using onne of the tricks used to prove convergence of sequences. Here is my proof:

a_{n}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{k}{n}}}.

170440,"In Taxicab Geometry, what is the solution to d(P, A) = 2 d(P, B) for two points, A and B?","Taxicab and Euclidean geometry differ a great deal, due to the modified metric function: $$d_T(A,B)=|x_a-x_b|+|y_a-y_b|$$ (Note that this means when measuring distance, it is not the length of the hypotenuse, but the sum of the legs of the same right triangle.) My Main Problem In Euclidean geometry, the answer to the question ""Find the locus of points $X$ such that: $d(X, A) = 2 * d(X, B)$"" yields a regular, Euclidean circle.  A little bit of algebra makes this very trivial. But what is the answer to the same problem, but for $d_T$? What I Know So Far This kind of geometry actually has a very interesting property, namely that as things rotate, their measures change.  Consider the cases where points share either one of their coordinates.  Many times, those situations yield the same answers as do their Euclidean counterparts. Some things are noticeably different, though.  For instance, a circle, as defined as the set of points a fixed distance from one point, actually comes out as a square, rotated 45 degrees.  It is also trivial to illustrate that. It did occur to me that the answer to this problem could be analogous to Euclidean geometry, and the solution may simply be a Taxicab circle (a square).  But this didn't seem to work out.  Plus, I worked out the solution for the points sharing an x or y coordinate, I end up with two mirror-image line segments.  But the general case, where the two points are corners of any rectangle still eludes me.  My second educated guess was that the solution could be a Euclidean circle, but this didn't work out either. Lastly, some constructions seemed to differ depending on whether the points I chose formed the opposite diagonal corners of a general rectangle, or a square.  E.g. (0,0) and (3, 3) seem to be a yet different type of exception. Any thoughts on this problem would be greatly appreciated!",['geometry']

170455,Why can/do we multiply all terms of a divisor with polynomial long division?,"I'm trying to understand why polynomial long division works and I've hit a wall when trying to understand why we multiply all terms of the divisor by the partial quotient.  Consider: $$\frac{x^2 + 3x + 2}{x + 2}$$ During the first step we divide ${x^2}$ by ${x}$ giving us a partial quotient of ${x}$.  Next, we multiply the partial quotient by the first term of the divisor, giving us ${x^2}$.  So far so good, but this next step is what I don't understand: why do we then multiply the next term of the divisor by the partial quotient (i.e. ${x}$ * ${2}$)?  It seems as though we're testing to see if ${x}$ can be divided into the first term of the dividend, and if it can, then we distribute the result over the whole divisor which is then subtracted.  I don't understand how we can do that when we're only testing the divisibility of those first terms. I tried a slightly different example to see what happens which highlights what I mean: $$\frac{x^2}{x + 1}$$ First, we test the divisibilty of ${x^2}$ by ${x}$.  Obviously it goes ${x}$ times, but then I wanted to see if I could carry on and multiply ${x}$ * ${1}$.  I carried on and the quotient becomes ${x + \frac{1}{x + 1} - 1}$.  Checking $({x + 1})({x + \frac{1}{x + 1} - 1})$ does give the original dividend of ${x^2}$.  Having worked through that problem I just can't see why we're able to do the multiplication of the second term of the divisor, subtract it and get everything to hold true.  Essentially, if I subtract ${x^2}$ from ${x^2}$ I end up with nothing.  So the second multiplication, to me at least, seems unclear as to why it works and what the purpose is. I know I'm missing something simple here but I can't seem to make the connection.  Could someone explain this to me please?","['algebra-precalculus', 'polynomials']"
170456,$C_c(X)$ dense in $L^p$,"In class we proved that $C_c(X)$ is dense in  $L^p$ where $X$ is a locally compact, $\sigma$-compact Hausdorff space either equipped with a Radon measure or equipped with a locally finite measure $\mu$ on the Borel sigma algebra. The proofs, especially of the second variant are fairly long and I find it very hard to remember all the conditions (locally finite, $\sigma$-compact etc.). The first variant uses Lusin's theorem (among others). 
So I thought I might try to reduce this to a more specific case, the Lebesgue measure (which is Radon) and $X$ any subset of $\mathbb R$. (Do I need any assumption on $X$? Perhaps it needs to be measurable.) Can you tell me if this is correct? Thank you. Claim: $C_c(X)$ is dense in $L^p$ with the Lebesgue measure and $X \subset \mathbb R$. Proof: We know that simple functions are dense in $L^p$. So if we can construct a function in $C_c$ that is $\varepsilon$-close (in $\|\cdot\|_p$) to $\chi_M$, the characteristic function of a measurable set $M$ then we're done. We know that $\mu$ is inner and outer regular so for $\varepsilon > 0$ we can find a compact set $K \subset M$ such that $\mu(M - K ) \leq \varepsilon$. Also, we can find an open set $O$ containing $M$. Let $f : K \sqcup O^c \to \mathbb R$ be the function that is $1$ on $K$ and $0$ on $O^c$. Then using Tietze we can continuously extend it to all of $X$. Then its extension $F \in C_c(X)$ and 
$$ \|F - \chi_M \|_p^p =  \int_X |F - \chi_M|^p d \mu = 1 \cdot \mu(M -K)^p \leq \varepsilon^p$$ So I don't need Lusin's theorem. Right?","['normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

170743,"Inclusion of $\mathbb{L}^p$ spaces, reloaded","I have a follow-up from this question . It was proved that, if $X$ is a linear subspace of $\mathbb{L}^1 (\mathbb{R})$ such that: $X$ is closed in $\mathbb{L}^1 (\mathbb{R})$; $X \subset \bigcup_{p > 1} \mathbb{L}^p (\mathbb{R})$, then $X \subset \mathbb{L}^p (\mathbb{R})$ for some $p>1$. I was wondering whether one could find a subspace $X$ satisfying these hypotheses and which is infinite-dimensional. It turns out this is possible. If one chooses a bump function, and considers the closure for the $\mathbb{L}^1 (\mathbb{R})$ norm of the space generated by the translates by integers of this bump function, one can emulate the $\ell^1$ space. The resulting $X$ will be closed, and included in $\mathbb{L}^p (\mathbb{R})$ for all $p>0$. To avoid this phenomenon, I'll restrict myself to smaller spaces. Is there a linear, closed, infinite-dimensional subspace $X$ of $\mathbb{L}^1 ([0,1])$ which is included in $\mathbb{L}^p ([0,1])$ for some $p>1$? The problem is that any obvious choice of countable basis will very easily generate all of $\mathbb{L}^1 ([0,1])$ (polynomials, trigonometric polynomials...), or $\mathbb{L}^1 (A)$ for some $A \subset [0,1]$, or at least one function which is in $\mathbb{L}^1$ but not in $\mathbb{L}^p$ for $p>1$...","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

Let $Y$ be Hausdorff space and $f,g:X \to Y$ be continuous functions. If there exists a set $A\subset X$ such that $\bar{A} = X$ and $f|_A = g|_A$, then $f=g$. I was trying to understand what would be the natural generalization of this fact in the category of schemes. We know that the correct analogous of a Hausdorff space is a separated scheme. So I was thinking in a statement like this: ""Let $Y$ be a separated scheme and $f,g:X \to Y$ be morphisms of schemes. If there exists a set $A\subset X$ such that $\bar{A} = X$ and $f|_A = g|_A$, then $f=g$."" The first problem is that we must be careful with this restriction ""$f|_A$"", since $f$ is a morphism and I want to consider the morphism of sheaves also. Then I saw that Liu's book on Algebraic Geometry has the following statement: ""Let $Y$ be a separated scheme, $X$ a reduced scheme, and $f,g:X \to Y$ morphisms of schemes. If there exists a dense open subset $U$ such that $f|_U=g|_U$, then $f=g$."" Now this makes sense, since we are dealing with open subsets now. But I still find this result too restrictive. So I came up with this: ""Let $Y$ be a separated scheme, $X$ a reduced scheme, and $f,g:X \to Y$ morphisms of schemes. If there exists a morphism $\varphi:S \to X$ such that $\varphi(S)$ is dense in $X$ and $f\circ \varphi = g\circ \varphi$, then $f=g$."" It's easy to see that Liu's proof of the result concerning only the open set also applies to this context. Finally, let's go to the questions: Is this really the best generalization? Is there any other results in this direction that are at least slightly different? I can see where the ""reduced"" hypothesis enters in the proof, but I found it a little strange. Is it just a technical point or can be ""understanded"" in some sense? Maybe counterexamples of this fact when this hypothesis isn't valid would help to clarify , but I didn't think of any. P.S.

  be positive definite. "" - source So consider $f(x) \in L^1 (\mathbb{R})$ where
$f(x) = \tfrac{1}{2} x^2$ if $-1 \leq x \leq 1$ and $0$ otherwise. Also consider $g(x) \in L^1 (\mathbb{R})$ where
$g(x) = 1$ if $-1\leq x \leq 1$ and $0$ otherwise. Now Bochner's theorem states that the Fourier transform of each of these functions should be positive definite. One well known property of Positive Definite functions $h(\xi)$ is that:
$h(0) \geq |h(x)|$
for all $x\in \mathbb{R}$. Now consider $\bar{g}$ and $\bar{f}$ the Fourier transforms of $g$ and $f$ respectively. 
Since $g(x)=f''(x)$ (a.e.) then
$\bar{g}(\xi) = \xi^2 \bar{f}(\xi)$
implying 
$\bar{g}(0)=0$ By Bochner's Theorem we know $\bar{g}$ is positive definite, but then this implies that $\bar{g}$ is zero for all $\xi$. But one can see by the Fourier inversion theorem this would imply $g$ is zero a.e. Obviously this is a contradiction. I've been banging my head on this for days, can you let me know where the error in the reasoning is? I am wondering if there is a mistake in the statement '$\bar{g}(\xi) = \xi^2 \bar{f}(\xi)$' or in my understanding of positive definite functions or in my use of Bochner's theorem. Thanks in advance! Note, I know my examples of f and g are discontinuous. If this is the problem, it isn't actually a problem in my situation, so if it helps, consider a smooth mollification of g and let f be the anti-derivative of its antiderivative.

Find a big-O estimate for $f(n)$ [ Hint : Make the substitution $m=\log n$ .] ( Note : here, $\log n$ stands for base 2 logarithm of $n$ .) In this solution, I am supposed to use the following variant of the Master Theorem: Master Theorem . Let $f$ be an increasing function that satisfies the recurrence relation $$f(n)=af(n/b)+cn^d$$ whenever $n=b^k$ , where $k$ is a positive integer, $a\geq 1$ , $b$ is an integer greater than 1, and $c$ and $d$ are real numbers with $c$ postive and $d$ nonnegative. Then $$\begin{align}f(n)&\text{is }\begin{cases} O(n^d)&\text{ if $a < b^d$,} \\ O(n^d\log n)&\text{ if $a = b^d$,} \\ O(n^{\log_b a})&\text{ if $a > b^d$.} \end{cases}\end{align}$$ I solved it as follows, but I'm not sure if this is correct: Following the hint given, I made the substitution $m = \log n$ .

To simplify the analysis, I will rewrite the recurrence relation above for $T(m)=f(2^m)$ : $$T(m)=2T(\dfrac{m}{2})+m\text{ with }T(1)=1$$ Now I will apply the Master Theorem for $T(m)$ . In this case, $d=1$ , $b=2$ and $a=2$ , this recurrence relation meets the condition $a=b^d$ in the Master Theorem; therefore: $$T(m)\text{ is }O(m^d\log m)=O(m\log m)$$ Now I will rewrite the estimate above in terms of $f(n)$ , substituting $T(m)=f(2^m)=f(2^{\log n})=f(n)$ and $m=\log n$ : $$f(n)\text{ is } O(\log n\log \log n)$$ Is this solution correct?

170984,Are commutative C*-algebras really dual to locally compact Hausdorff spaces?,"Several online sources (e.g. Wikipedia , the nLab ) assert that the Gelfand representation defines a contravariant equivalence from the category of (non-unital) commutative $C^{\ast}$-algebras to the category of locally compact Hausdorff (LCH) spaces. This seems wrong to me. The naive choice is to take all continuous maps between LCH spaces. This doesn't work. For example, the constant map $\mathbb{R} \to \bullet$ does not come from a morphism $\mathbb{C} \to C_0(\mathbb{R})$, the problem being that composing with the map $\bullet \to \mathbb{C}$ sending $\bullet$ to $1$ gives a function on $\mathbb{R}$ which doesn't vanish at infinity. It is necessary for us to restrict our attention to proper maps . But this still doesn't work. If $A, B$ are any commutative $C^{\ast}$-algebras we can consider the morphism
$$A \ni a \mapsto (a, 0) \in A \times B.$$ This morphism does not define a map on Gelfand spectra; if $\lambda : A \times B \to \mathbb{C}$ is a character factoring through the projection $A \times B \to B$, then composing with the above morphism gives the zero map $A \to \mathbb{C}$. This contradicts the nLab's claim that taking Gelfand spectra gives a functor into locally compact Hausdorff spaces (if one requires that the morphisms are defined everywhere on the latter category). The correct statement appears to be that commutative $C^{\ast}$-algebras are contravariantly equivalent to the category $\text{CHaus}_{\bullet}$ of pointed compact Hausdorff spaces; the functor takes an algebra to the Gelfand spectrum of its unitization (we adjoin a unit whether or not the algebra already had one). There is an inclusion of the category of LCH spaces and proper maps into this category but it is not an equivalence because maps $(C, \bullet) \to (D, \bullet)$ in $\text{CHaus}_{\bullet}$ may send points other than the distinguished point of $C$ to the distinguished point of $D$.

171115,Why algebraic closures?,"Let me begin by summarizing the question: Why do we care about fields closed under rational exponentiation, and less about fields closed under other operations? Historically the solution for polynomials was important, and people were trying to find a good way to test when a certain polynomial has a root. This led to talking about algebraically closed fields, where polynomials have roots. I will particularly focus on the rationals from now on. How do we construct the rational numbers? We begin with $\{0,1\}$ and we say that if we add $1+1+\ldots+1$ we never have $0$ . We begin by closing this set under addition, then under subtraction and then under division. However we can consider the alternative, we iterate from $\{0,1\}$ and at every step we add solutions all four operations on the elements we have thus far, so the construction would go like: $\{0,1\}$ , we begin. Next we add additive inverse, a term for $1+1$ and multiplicative inverse for $1$ : $\{-1,0,1,2\}$ . Now we add the additive inverse for $2$ , the addition of $1+2$ , and multiplicative inverse for $2$ : $\{-2,-1,0,\frac12,1,2,3\}$ . Now we add the sums possible with the elements we have so far, the missing inverses, and so on: $\{-3,-2,-1\frac12,-1,-\frac12,0,\frac14,\frac13,\frac12,1,1\frac12,2\frac12,3,3\frac12,4,5\}$ . We continue ad infinitum. It is not very hard to see that any rational number is in this set, and that this set forms a field (indeed the rationals). Consider now the family of operations $\exp_q(x)=x^q$ defined for $x\geq 0$ and for a rational number $q$ . If we reiterate the above algorithm from $\mathbb Q$ and close it under $\exp_q(x)$ for positive $q$ we end up with a subfield of the real-closure of $\mathbb Q$ . The result, while not the entire real algebraic numbers, is radically closed. Any number in the field has a root of any rational order. If we only take closure under a limited collection $\exp_q$ functions we will get a subfield of this field (e.g. close only under $\exp_{0.5}$ ). Consider now the Sine-closure of $\mathbb Q$ : $Q_0=\mathbb Q$ , we begin with the rationals. $Q_1=Q_0\cup\{\sin(x)\mid x\in Q_0\}$ , the rationals were closed under field operations, so we only need to add $\sin$ 's. $Q_2$ is the collection of all sums and multiplication of pairs from $Q_1$ , adding additive and multiplicative inverses, and adding $\sin(x)$ for $x\in Q_1$ . $Q_3$ constructed the same. We finish by taking $\mathbb Q_{\sin}=\bigcup_{n=0}^\infty Q_n$ . This is a field which extends $\mathbb Q$ and is closed under the function $\sin$ . This field contains transcendental elements and is countable, so it is a non-algebraic subfield of $\mathbb R$ . So why are we mostly interested in algebraically closed fields, and not in fields like the Sine-closure of $\mathbb Q$ (or perhaps other construction similar to this one)? Is the reason historical, is it because algebra and analysis are somewhat disjoint in their purposes and analysis takes $\mathbb{R,C}$ to begin with?","['soft-question', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
