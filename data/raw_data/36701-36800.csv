354006,"In the marriage problem, if each girl knows at least $m$ boys, then there are at least $m!$ ways to arrange the marriages.","I'm finding problems concerning Hall's theorem very difficult even when they're not. (See here for example. I'm sure I wouldn't have come up with the solution in a million years even though it's probably one of the simplest solutions to any problem I've ever seen.) This one is probably easy too, but I have no idea how to approach it. Please, if you can, include in your answers some general tips because I'm starting to feel that I'm not able to learn to think about these things properly. Suppose we have $n$ girls and $k$ boys satisfying Hall's condition for the existence of a marriage arrangment such that each girls is given a husband. Suppose additionally that each girl knows at least $m$ boys ($m\leq n$). I'm to show that there are at least $m!$ possible ways to arrange the marriages. First, I think that it could be a good idea to change the assumption that the youth satisfy Hall's condition to the assumption that there exists at least one marriage arrangement. We can do this by Hall's theorem, and this is the idea I was missing in trying to solve the linked problem. Second, I think it should be possible to solve this by induction on $m$. That's because there's a factorial involved. I thought at first that from the linked fact I could infer that any girl could marry anyone she knew, and then proceed by induction getting the result, but that's incorrect because of the following counterexample. Boys: a,b; girls: A,B; A knows a; B knows a and b. Now it is possible match them all, but B can't marry a even though she knows him. Third, it wouldn't hurt to understand what the assumption that $m\leq n$ is for, which I don't. This is really all I've got. I can't even solve the problem for $m=2$. Then I can assume we have each of the girls married to a boy and that each know some boy other then her husband.

354013,Hall's Theorem of Solvable Groups (Conjugacy),"The problem is asking for a proof of Hall's theorem for finite solvable groups, namely that there exist Hall $\pi$-subgroups of $G$ a finite solvable group for any set of primes $\pi$ and furthermore that they are all conjugate.

With $N/M$ a minimal normal $q$-subgroup of $G/M$, I can also prove that for $Q∈\text{Syl}_q(N)$, $n$ divides $N_G(Q)$ where $Q$ is assumed nonnormal in $G$ so that by induction all the Hall $\pi$-subgroups of $N_G(Q)$ are conjugate, but how to prove that an arbitrary Hall $\pi$-subgroup is contained in $N_G(Q)$?

354022,"Probability that a string of $5$ characters from set$\{a,b,c,d,e,f\}$ contains exactly one '$a$', given that it contains at least one vowel","This is a past paper exam question.
It doesn't have a mark scheme, so I was hoping somebody could check this answer for me. It's non-calculator, but I don't expect that affects the method used. My solution is based on the accepted answer here: Combinatorics question about english letters (with consonants and vowels) Let P(A) be the probability that the string contains exactly one '$a$'
Let P(B) be the probability that the string contains at least one vowel. Need to find $P(A|B) = \frac {P(B|A) \cdot P(A)} {P(B)}$ Total combinations of $5$ letters from the set of $5 = 6^5$ $P(A)$ can be satisfied by a single 'a' being in any of 5 places - $5 \choose 1$ , and the other 4 places in the string can be any of 5 characters - $4^5$. Then $P(A) = \frac {5 \cdot 4^5} {6^5}$ $P(B)$ :
There are $6^5$ total combinations, as above. 
Of these, There are $4^5$ with no vowels.
Then, $P(B) = \frac {6^5 - 4^5} {6^5}$ Now, $P(B|A) = 1$, since $A$ is sufficient for $B$ - there must be a vowel if there is an 'a' So, $P(A|B) = \frac {P(B|A) \cdot P(A)} {P(B)} = \frac {P(A)} {P(B)} = \frac {\frac {5 \cdot 4^5} {6^5}} {\frac {6^5 - 4^5} {6^5}}$ -- This seems to make sense, but I'm not completely convinced about my calculations, particularly for $P(A)$.

354032,Using Lax Milgram to find a weak solution in an intersection of Sobolev spaces,"I am trying to prove the existence of a weak solution of the problem:
$$
-\Delta^2 u = f \in L^2(U)\\ \\
u|_{\partial U}=\Delta u|_{\partial U} = 0
$$
on the bounded open set $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ which has smooth boundary. The weak formulation follows from multiplying by the test function $v$ and integration by parts: $$
\int_U fv\,dx= \int_U \, (\Delta^2 u) v\, dx= \int_U \Delta u \Delta v \, dx + \int_{\partial U} (v \frac{\partial \Delta u}{\partial n} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial n}\Delta u)dS.
$$
The second boundary vanishes for $\Delta u|_{\partial U} = 0$ and to make the first boundary term vanish we require $v$ to be in the Sobolev space $H^1_0(U)\cap H^2(U)$, so that $v=0$ on the boundary. Therefore $u\in H^1_0(U)\cap H^2(U)$ is a weak solution if:
$$
\int_U \Delta u \Delta v \, dx = \int_U fv\,dx\,\,\,\, \forall v\in H^1_0(U)\cap H^2(U).
$$ Now I want to use the Lax-Milgram theorem on the bilinear form $B[u,v]=\int_U \Delta u \Delta v \, dx$. My problem is: what norm on $H^1_0(U)\cap H^2(U)$ should I use? At first I thought I could use either one of the norms of $H^1_0(U)$ or $H^2(U)$, since clearly $H^1_0(U)\cap H^2(U)$ is a closed subspace of both spaces. However I realized that this argument must be wrong, otherwise I might as well use the norm of the subspace $H^{8}(U)$ and conclude there exists a weak solution in that space. Or should I use Lax Milgram for both $H^1_0(U)$ and $H^2(U)$ and conclude that the weak solution is in their intersection? My second problem: when proving the coercivity of $B[u,v]$, I think I need an inequality like $\int_U |\Delta u|^2 dx \geq C\int_U u^2 dx$ for some constant $C$. I know this holds for $u\in H^2_0(U)$ but I don't see why this should hold in $H^1_0(U)\cap H^2(U)$?","['normed-spaces', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

354065,Intuition behind compact subspaces of a metric space,"I've read up on compactness in a metric space and have found a few definitions (let $X$ be a metric space and $E \subset X$ in all the following): $E$ is compact in $X$ if for every open covering of $E$ in $X$, $\{G_{\alpha \in A}\}$, $\exists$ a finite sub cover, $\{G_{\alpha \in B}\}$ s.t. $E \subset \cup_{\alpha \in B} G_{\alpha}$ $E$ is compact if every sequence in $E$ has a convergent subsequence. $E$ is compact in $X$ if it is closed and bounded in $X$.

Then the second definition I can't really understand at all... I can't seem to intuitively relate it to either of the other definitions.

354107,Lebesgue Convergence Theorem,"I need some clarifications about the Lebesgue Convergence theorems, I am using the book Beginning Functional Analysis by Karen Saxe and I believe that she has stated the monotone convergence theorem wrong and also made a mistake in the proof. Let $M$ be the set of Lebesgue measurable sets. She writes: Theorem 3.13 Suppose that $A\in M$ and that $\{f_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty }$ is a sequence of measurable functions such that $0\leq f_1(x) \leq f_2(x)\leq \dots$ for almost all $x\in A$. Let $f$ be defined to be the pointwise limit, $f(x)=\lim_{k \to \infty} f_k(x)$, of this sequence. Then $f$ is integrable and $\lim_{k \to \infty} \int_{A}f_k dm=\int_{A}f dm$. In the proof she uses the monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral to conclude that $\int_{A}f_1dm \leq \int_{A}f_2 dm\leq \dots \leq \int_{A}f dm$ and she states that $\{\int_{A}f_kdm\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a bounded and non decreasing sequence of real numbers. My objections are that this sequence may NOT be assumed to be bounded since $\int_{A}f dm$ may be infinite, in fact she has stated in the theorem that she will prove it to be finite. As I would guess, please correct me and help me to clarify this, the word integrable should be changed to measurable (so that the integral is defined, this is really a separate statement, i.e. limit of measurable functions are measurable) and she should remove the word bounded from the proof and instead let the limit of this sequence be finite or infinite, the rest of the proof would then stay valid. Am I correct if I understand it like this: The monotone convergence theorem and Fatou's Lemma doesn't say anything about the integrability of the limit function only of the value of the integrals (I.e this value may be infinite).

354123,Cauchy's functional equation - a generalisation? (do additive maps have to be continuous?),"If a map $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is additive, in the sense that $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$, then it is simple to show that $f$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-linear, buy it does not need to be $\mathbb{R}$-linear in general. This is a classical problem, known as Cauchy's functional equation . It turns out that as soon as the function is even remotely regular (continuous, bounded on an interval, or measurable), on can show that it has to be linear, and thus of the form $f(x) = cx$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$. It turns out that after some work, one can prove a similar claim about maps of the torus $T = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$: if $f :\ T \to T$ obeys $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$ and is measurable, then it is of the form $f(x) = cx$, where $c \in \mathbb{Z}$. I think that it follows that additive maps on $T^m$, or $\mathbb{R}^n$, or even $\mathbb{R}^n \times T^m$, are necessarily 
""linear"". I believe it can be shown by applying the $1$-dimensional result to $t \mapsto \pi f(tv)$, where $\pi$ are projections and $v$ are vectors. (For instance, for $T^2$, write $f(t_1,t_2) = (f_{11}(t_{1}) + f_{12}(t_2),  f_{21}(t_{1}) + f_{22}(t_2))$ and reason for each $f_{ij}$ independently).

Is the result for the torus and/or multidimensional case generally known, and if so what would be a good keyword for further search or a reference? Is there an easy proof for the torus? (my reasoning for the torus goes very much like the standard one for $\mathbb{R}$ I know of, but perhaps there is a clever reduction from one to the other?) If I am not mistaken about the multidimensional case, it would follow that a an additive map of a commutative Lie group into itself is automatically continuous, and even has a particularly nice form. Is it true that an additive map of a general Lie group into itself is automatically continuous? Edit/Answer It turns out that the related issues have been studied with much success and are relatively well understood (at least insofar as there are strong results on the topic). The phenomenon in question is known as Automatic Continuity, and has been studied by the Polish mathematical school, and Andre Weil. There are theorems that assure continuity of Baire measurable homomorphisms between Polish group (Banach) and Haar measurable homomorphism from a locally compact Polish group into a Polish group (Weil).

we know that $0$ is in the spectrum of $T$. This implies that either
$T$ is not invertible, or if it is then the inverse operator isn't bounded. Now,
if $T$ did have an inverse $T^{-1}$, then $T$ would be a bijective bounded operator. Hence, by the Banach Open mapping theorem, the map $T^{-1}$ would
be bounded. This seems to imply that no compact operator is invertible. But it seems that if $\{x_{n}\}$ is a basis for $X$, then define our operator $T$
so that $Tx_{n}=\lambda_{n}x_{n}$, where, say $\lambda_{n}=2^{-n}$. This operator $T$
is approximated by finite-rank operators, and hence is compact. Also $T^{-1}$ exists, but it obviously isn't bounded. What is going on here? I feel like I'm going in circles.","['operator-theory', 'compact-operators', 'functional-analysis']"

354161,Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for bilinear forms valued in an abstract vector space,"This question is perhaps a little vague; part of what I want to know is what question I should ask. First, recall the following form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: let $V$ be a real vector space, and suppose $(\cdot, \cdot) : V \times V \to \mathbb{R}$ is a symmetric bilinear form which is positive semidefinite, that is, $(x,x) \ge 0$ for all $x$.  Then for any $x,y \in V$ we have $|(x,y)|^2 \le (x,x) (y,y)$. I'd like to know what happens if we replace $\mathbb{R}$ by some other space $W$.  Suppose at first that $W$ is a real vector space, equipped with a partial order $\le$ that makes it an an ordered vector space , as well as a multiplication operation $\cdot$ that makes it an algebra.  Then it makes sense to speak of a positive semidefinite symmetric bilinear form $(\cdot, \cdot) : V \times V \to W$, and ask whether it satisfies the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality $(v,w)\cdot(v,w) \le (v,v) \cdot (v,w)$. Under what conditions on $W$ does this ""generalized Cauchy-Schwarz inequality"" hold? At a minimum I expect we will need some more structure on $W$; in particular I assume we would like the multiplication and the partial ordering in $W$ to interact in some reasonable way, so that for instance $w\cdot w \ge 0$ for all $w \in W$.  Are there other properties that $W$ should have? There are lots of proofs of the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality ; presumably one should try to find one of them which generalizes.  But I couldn't immediately see how to do this. Here are some motivating examples. As a fairly simple one, let $X$ be any set, and $W = \mathbb{R}^X$ the vector space of all real-valued functions on $X$.  We can equip $W$ with the pointwise multiplication and ordering.  Then let $V$ be any linear subspace of $W$, and let the bilinear form $V \times V \to W$ also be pointwise multiplication.  Then of course Cauchy-Schwarz holds since we can just prove it pointwise. For a slightly less trivial example, let $(X,\mu)$ be a measure space, and $W = L^0(X,\mu)$ be the vector space of all measurable functions on $X$, mod $\mu$-almost-everywhere equality (so an element of $W$ is in fact an equivalence class of functions).  Again let $\cdot$ be pointwise multiplication (which is well defined), and the ordering $f \le g$ when $f(x) \le g(x)$ almost everywhere.  Take again a linear subspace $V \subset W$, and pointwise multiplication as the bilinear form.  Now Cauchy-Schwarz holds because we can prove it pointwise on a set of full measure. A related but more complicated example from probability (and my original motivation) is the quadratic variation form from probability.  For instance, we could take $V$ to be the vector space of continuous $L^2$ martingales on some filtered probability space over some time interval $[0,T]$, and $W$ the vector space of continuous adapted processes of bounded variation, mod indistinguishability , with pointwise multiplication and the partial order $X \le Y$ iff $X_t \le Y_t$ for all $t$ almost surely.  Then the quadratic variation $\langle M,N \rangle$ is a symmetric positive semidefinite bilinear form from $V \times V$ to $W$. In this case I can prove the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality pointwise: fix $M,N \in V$.  For almost every $\omega$, for all $t \in [0,T]$ and all $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ I can say
$$q^2 \langle M,M \rangle_t(\omega) \pm 2 \langle M,N \rangle_t(\omega) + \frac{1}{q^2} \langle N,N \rangle_t(\omega) = \langle q M \pm \frac{1}{q} N \rangle_t(\omega) \ge 0$$
and then letting $q$ be a rational very close to $\sqrt{\langle N,N \rangle_t(\omega) / \langle M,M \rangle_t(\omega)}$ shows that $$|\langle M,N \rangle_t(\omega)| \le \sqrt{\langle M,M \rangle_t(\omega) \langle N,N \rangle_t(\omega)}$$
which is what we want. In each of these examples, we are working on function spaces (or quotients thereof), and the proof essentially operates pointwise.  I'm hoping for some kind of more abstract global argument.","['abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'inequality', 'real-analysis']"

The second and fourth constraints were added afterwards, so keep that in mind while viewing comments/answers Bonus points if you can find a function that has an elementary integral and that approaches y = x + 1 I've managed to get a function that displays all of the properties except the inflection at zero (and obviously the decrease in $f'(x)$), being hyperbolic (simply $\sqrt{1 + x^2 / 4}+ x / 2$). The actual purpose isn't for mathematical purposes, it's for a program. In short I need to normalize a value so that it cannot drop below 0 but has no cap therein, and should approach additivity but with diminishing returns, rather than increasing that I would get with the hyperbolic one above. Thus, for most of the positive portion I need it to be concave down. If it's integrable I can do more things with it without breaking time-independence but most of the time it won't matter.","['calculus', 'functions']"

Also, let $\overline{X}$ be their average, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\in \mathbf{n}} X_i$. Then, as shown below, $$
\mathrm{Var}(\overline{X}) = \mathrm{Cov}(X_i, \overline{X})
\tag{1}
$$ What seems uncanny to me about this equality is that each side ""arrives"" at its value, $\sigma^2/n$, by what look to me like entirely unrelated paths! On the LHS, this value comes from $$\mathrm{Var}(\overline{X})=\mathrm{Var}\left( \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\in \mathbf{n}} X_i \right)=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i\in \mathbf{n}}\mathrm{Var}(X_i)=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i\in \mathbf{n}}\sigma^2=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$$ IOW, each summand contributes equally to the final value. On the RHS, it comes from $$
\begin{align}
\mathrm{Cov}(X_i, \overline{X})=\mathrm{Cov}\left(X_i, \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j\in \mathbf{n}} X_j\right)
& = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j\in \mathbf{n}} \mathrm{Cov}(X_i, X_j) \\
& = \frac{1}{n}\left( \mathrm{Var}(X_i) + \sum_{j\in \mathbf{n}\backslash\{i\}} \mathrm{Cov}(X_i, X_j) \right) \\
& = \frac{1}{n} ( \sigma^2 + 0 ) \\
& = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \\
\end{align}
$$ In this case, only the summand for $j = i$ contributes to the final value; the remaining ones are zero, by assumption. I'm missing an interpretation of the covariance that would help me decide what to make of $(1)$: i.e. is it remarkable? is it uncanny? is it fortuitous? is it trivial?....  Is there an interpretation of the covariance that will put $(1)$ in the right perspective? PS: I know, of course, that the covariance of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is the difference between the expected value of their product and the product of their expected values.  Alternatively, it is the expected value of the product of the ""errors"", $(X - \mathbb{E}(X))(Y - \mathbb{E}(Y))$.  But neither interpretation tells me what to make of $(1)$ above. EDIT: If I understand Henry's answer correctly, one can cast each side so that they have a similar-looking form, namely, for the LHS: $$
\begin{align}
\mathrm{Var}(\overline{X}) =
\mathrm{Var}\left(\sum_{j\in\mathbf{n}}\frac{X_j}{n}\right) 
&= \sum_{j\in\mathbf{n}} \sum_{k\in\mathbf{n}}\mathrm{Cov}\left(\frac{X_j}{n}, \frac{X_k}{n}\right) \\
&= \sum_{j\in\mathbf{n}} \mathrm{Var}\left(\frac{X_j}{n}\right) + \sum_{j\in\mathbf{n}}\sum_{k\in\mathbf{n}\backslash\{j\}}\mathrm{Cov}\left(\frac{X_j}{n}, \frac{X_k}{n}\right),
\tag{2}
\end{align}
$$ and on the RHS (using the trick of expressing $X_i$ as $\sum_{k\in\mathbf{n}}X_i/n$): $$
\begin{align}
\mathrm{Cov}(X_i, \overline{X}) = \mathrm{Cov}(\overline{X}, X_i) &= \mathrm{Cov}\left( \sum_{j\in\mathbf{n}}\frac{X_j}{n} , \sum_{k\in\mathbf{n}} \frac{X_i}{n}\right)\\
&= \sum_{j\in\mathbf{n}} \sum_{k\in\mathbf{n}}\mathrm{Cov}\left(\frac{X_j}{n}, \frac{X_i}{n}\right) \\
&= \sum_{k\in\mathbf{n}}\mathrm{Var}\left(\frac{X_i}{n}\right) + \sum_{j\in\mathbf{n}\backslash\{i\}} \sum_{k\in\mathbf{n}}\mathrm{Cov}\left(\frac{X_j}{n}, \frac{X_i}{n}\right) \tag{3}\\
\end{align}
$$ Now each side consists indeed of a sum of $n$ terms with value $\sigma^2/n^2$ plus a sum of $n(n-1)$ terms with value $0$. But I think this maneuver just ""smears out"" the difference I originally pointed out, and makes it harder to notice.  If one pays attention to the indices in each of the final expressions in $(2)$ and $(3)$, one can see that they are semantically different after all. Then again, at heart, what this manipulation boils down to is to re-express $(1)$ as $$
\mathrm{Cov}(\overline{X}, \overline{X}) = \mathrm{Cov}(\overline{X}, X_i)
\tag{$1^\prime$}
$$ or even as $$
\mathrm{Cov}\left(\sum_{k\in\mathbf{n}}X_k, \sum_{k\in\mathbf{n}}X_k\right) = \mathrm{Cov}\left(\sum_{k\in\mathbf{n}}X_k, \sum_{k\in\mathbf{n}}X_i\right)

For example, suppose $M = 21$, $N = 32$, $a = 10$, $b = 4$, $c = 2$, $d = 3$. The following is a solution: $$ H = C\ \circ \ D\ \circ\ B\ \circ\ A\ \circ\ C $$ $$H(21) = \left(\frac{((21 \cdot  2) + 10) - 4}{3}\right) \cdot  2  = 32$$ Here is what I have considered so far. If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, so $\gcd(a,b) = 1$, we can make $H$ from just add and subtract operations. When that isn't the case, such as in the example above, where the $\gcd(a,b) = 2$, we are in a different situation. Above, using just add and/or subtract, we can arrive at all odd numbers. In general, if $\gcd(a,b) = g$, then we can make an $H$ such that $H(M) = M + gk$, where $k \in \mathbb{N}$. In other words, one can map $M$ to any integer $j$ such that $M\equiv j \pmod{g}$. In the above example, we could use multiply by 2 in order to expand to an even number, and then use adds or subtracts in order to arrive at any even integer. At this point I got stuck. I am not sure how to apply multiply and divide to equivalence classes modulo $g$. (In particular the divide operation, since it can take integer dividends into non-integral quotients). Lastly, although I think this approach could prove the existence of such an $H$, I am unsure how to extract the ordering of function compositions to build it. Later on, I will be interested in a method for finding the $H$ with the least number of function transpositions. This question was inspired by a question posted on StackOverflow here . I am interested in the case where division is applied normally, i.e. 3 / 2 = 1.5 and not integer division such as in C++ (decimals truncated toward zero).

I think it is difficult. $$\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{\log(k)}{k}\sin(2k \mu \pi) = \pi \left(\log(\Gamma(\mu)) +\frac{1}{2}\log \sin(\pi \mu)-(1-\mu)\log(\pi)- \left(\frac{1}{2}-\mu\right)(\gamma+\log 2)\right)$$ Can someone suggest a method of attack? $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni Constant.

354802,How should I think of lines and planes in projective space?,"I have been learning about projective varieties recently and I realised that I have some trouble trying to grasp what lines and planes are even in say $\Bbb{P}^3$. For one, how should I think about a line? Well given homogeneous coordinates for two points $A$ and $B$ I can write down an expression that gives all possible points on the ""line between $A$ and $B$"". However this does not seem satisfying because of the following. In affine space, I am inclined to think of a line as a being a one dimensional $k$ - vector space that is isomorphic to $\Bbb{A}^1$ under an affine change of coordinates. A plane isomorphic to $k^2$, etc. Also,  I am inclined to think that given two planes $P_1,P_2$ in $\Bbb{A}^3$ the ""dimension"" of their intersection is at most $1$. However can all of this intuitive reasoning be transferred over to $\Bbb{P}^3$ say? By this I mean is the intersection of two ""planes in $\Bbb{P}^3$"" a ""line""? This is of course assuming that we have defined a ""plane"" and ""line"" in $\Bbb{P}^3$. What should be the definition of a ""plane"" in $\Bbb{P}^3$? Also, how many ""hyperplanes"" do I need to describe a line in $\Bbb{P}^n$? I guess all this is confusing for me because my background has mainly been in a lot of algebra and not much on questions like that.","['algebraic-geometry', 'projective-geometry']"
