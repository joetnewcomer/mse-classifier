253979,Find integral from 1 to infinity of $1/(1+x^2)$,I am practicing for an exam and am having trouble with this problem. Find the integral from 1 to infinity of $\frac{1}{1+x^2}$. I believe the integral's anti-derivative is $\arctan(x)$ which would make this answer $\arctan(\infty)-\arctan(1)$ but from here I'm lost. I did find out that this comes out to $\pi/4$ but I don't know why.,"['trigonometry', 'calculus', 'integration']"

  $$\sum_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1} \frac{3}{5^n}.$$ I found that the series converges using the Alternating Series test because the absolute value of each $n$ decreases while the value of $n$ increases. Then I took the limit as $x$ approaches infinity of $3/5^x$ which is $0$. But I am not sure how to go about finding the sum at this point.

254010,Can a path avoid a dense set?,"My actual question is related to an unusual circumstance in a game which I am playing. We are trying to move one point-like object from one part of the moon to another without passing through another player's land. However, due to a loophole, nothing prevented one friend from buying a dense set of measure zero. (The game encourages rules-lawyering so this isn't completely out of line). We now don't know what's going on. I imagine the simplest version of this question would be if there is a continuous nontrivial curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that avoid every point in $\mathbb{Q}^2$, but now I'm curious if there's a way we that this statement could be generalized to arbitrary topological spaces (without necessarily having a measure). Technically, according to this game the object has to have a velocity, so to resolve the confusion for us we'd need a curve that is also non-differentiable at at most countably many points, but I don't know enough about differentiablity to imagine the appropriate generalization.",['general-topology']

However, we also have $\int f_n = \log(n) \to \infty = \int f$. (2) $f_n(x) = \frac{1}{n}\chi_{(0,n)}(x)$.  We have $\int f_n = 1 \not \to \int f = 0$, but now $\int f = 0 \neq \pm \infty$.

I need help doing this in polar coordinates. I see that $z=1+x^2 +y^2=1+r^2$, the graph of which is easy to visualize.

254299,Why does maximum likelihood estimation work the way that it does?,"I'm wrapping my head around MLE right now and there's something about it that bothers me, irrationally I'm sure. I believe I understand the procedure: essentially we hold our observations fixed and maximize the likelihood function with respect to the parameters to find the parameters which would make a PDF that assigns a maximum value to our observations. My question it this: why do we care about finding such a PDF? In particular, I'm imagining that we end up with a very skewed PDF so that the expected value is far from the maximum. Or what if we have an even weirder PDF than that? If $f$ is a PDF, it was my understanding that the number $f(x)$ is not particularly meaningful for continuous random variables—it's the area under the curve that we care about. So why aren't we in some way trying to maximize the area under our observations, or taking the expected value into account or something? Hopefully this question makes a little bit of sense.

254371,A Question on Using a Half-Divergent Sequence.,"$\theta$ is an irrational in $[0,1]$ with continued fraction representation $[0;a_1,a_2,\dots]$, and the sequences $(a_k), (n_k)$ are related by the recurrence relation $n_{k+1}=a_{k+1}n_k+n_{k-1},  n_0=1, n_{-1}=0$. They are also related by the fact that there is a $\delta>0$ for which $n_k^\delta<a_k<2n_k^\delta$. Suppose $(a_k)$ is half-divergent (see $(*)$ below for my definition). Suppose that for any $i$ I have $$ s\ge \frac{\log_{a_{k_i+1}}}{n_{k_{i+1}}-n_{k_i}},$$ where $n_{k_{i+1}}-n_{k_i}\to \infty$ and $(a_{k_i})$ is a subsequence of $(a_k)$ Hence $$s\ge\limsup_{i\to \infty} \frac{\log(a_{k_i+1})}{n_{k_{i+1}}-n_{k_i}}$$ Since $(a_k)$ is half-divergent, it diverges on any subsequence where it is unbounded. 
My question: Does this imply that for any $\varepsilon \le s$, I can choose a subsequence of $(a_k)$ for which $$\varepsilon \le \limsup_{i\to \infty} \frac{\log(a_{k_i+1})}{ n_{k_{i+1}}- n_{k_i}}\le s?$$ If so, is there an effective way to choose the subsequence? $(*)$ A sequence $(a_k)$ is half-divergent if $\exists M\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\forall N>M, \exists k_0$ such that $k>k_0$ implies that either $a_{k+1}\le M$ or $a_{k+1}>N$",['limits']

254431,Poincaré-Bendixson,"Let $M$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and consider the ordinary differential equation $\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t))$, where $f \in \mathcal{C}^{1}(M, \mathbb{R}^{2})$ and denote by $\Phi(.,.)$ its flow. For $x \in M$, let $\omega (x) := \{y \in M \ : \ \exists t_{n} \to +\infty \ s.t. \Phi(t_{n},x) \to y \}$ and $\alpha(x):= \{y \in M \ : \ \exists t_{n} \to -\infty \ s.t. \Phi(t_{n},x) \to y \}$.
Suppose that $\omega(x)$ is compact. Then it is also connected (see for example the exercices in the according chapter in the book ""Differential Equations ..."" by Hirsch, Smale, Devaney). The Poincaré-Bendixson theorem states that if $\omega(x)$ contains only finitely many fixed points then $\omega(x)$ is either
a) a single fixed point b) the periodic orbit of some $y \in \omega(x)$ or c) it consists of regular and fixed points and for every regular point $y \in \omega(x)$ we have that $\omega(y)$ consists of a single fixed point, and the same is true for $\alpha(y)$ . It can be also shown that for two distinct fixed points $z_{1}, z_{2} \in \omega(x)$ there is maximally one orbit $\gamma(y)\subset \omega(x)$ which joins them. So if one supposes additionally (to the compactness hypothesis) that in $\omega(x)$ there are only finitely many homoclinic orbits included, then it is easy to show that for each set of distinct fixed points $z_{1},z_{2} \in \omega(x)$  there is exactly one heteroclinc orbit connecting them (this is also called a ""graphic""). But what can be said if there is a fixed point $z_{0} \in \omega(x)$ with infinitely many homoclinic orbits in $\omega(x)$? Is then still true that any pair of distinct fixed point $z_{1}, z_{2}$ in $\omega(x)$ can be joined by an heteroclinic orbit contained in $\omega(x)$?
This does not seem to be obvious, because (from what I know) it seems possible that the there is a sequence of regular points $y_{n} \subset \omega(x)$ such the orbits $\gamma(y_{n})$ are homoclinic ones which end in $z_{0}$ while the sequence $y_{n}$ converges to another fixed point $z_{1} \in \omega(x)$ in a way so that $\omega(x)$ is connected (think of the topologist's sine curve) without containing a heteroclinic orbit which joins the fixed points $z_{0}$ and $z_{1}$.","['general-topology', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

So from the second isomorphism theorem we have that: $HK/H\cong H/(H\cap K)$ which gives that $G/H\cong H/(H\cap K)$ $HK/K\cong K/(H\cap K)$ which gives that $G/K\cong K/(H\cap K)$ So we must now show that: $H/(H\cap K)\times K/(H\cap K)\cong G/(H\cap K)$ So consider the map $\theta:H/(H\cap K)\times K/(H\cap K)\rightarrow G/(H\cap K)$

Consider Lebesgue extension of $\lambda_p$ of measure $m_p$. It is defined on some $\sigma$-algebra $\mathfrak{M}_p(\mathcal{S})$. Since I want to consider this extensions for different $p$ I will restrict $\lambda_p$ to $\mathfrak{B}(\mathcal{S})$ and denote the resulting measure $\mu_p$. I will be happy to get answers to some of the following questions. 1) How to prove that $m_p$ is $\sigma$-additive? 2) Is it true that $\mu_p$ is regular? 3) Is it true that $\mathfrak{M}_{p_1}(\mathcal{S})\neq \mathfrak{M}_{p_2}(\mathcal{S})$ for $p_1\neq p_2$? 4) Does there exist explicit construction of the set $B\in\mathfrak{B}(\mathcal{S})$ such that $\mu_{p_1}(B)=1$ and $\mu_{p_2}(B)=0$ for $p_1\neq p_2$. Less concrete questions are: 1) Does this type of measures have a name? 2) Where can I find articles about their properties?

What is the probability that $x$ and $y$ are split for large values of $x, y$ but for $|x - y|$ fixed, i.e. $x, y \to \infty$ but $y - x$ constant. It seems to me that asymptotically things should only depend on $y - x$; for $x, y$ near $0$ it seems as though there is dependence on the fact that we started the sum from $0$ that I think we escape from for large $x, y$. Update : I have a heuristic argument that gives the asymptotic probability of $x$ and $y$ being split as $1 - (1 - |x - y|)^2_+$ where $(a)_+$ denotes $\max\{0, a\}$. The argument is as follows: it should not matter asymptotically where $x$ and $y$ lie, so we can assume $x= k$ for some positive integer $k$. $x$ and $y$ will be split if, for the first value of $S_i$ in the interval $[x, x + 1]$, we have $x \le S_i \le y$. Consider the Markov chain $T_j$ consisting of the fractional parts of those $S_i$ such that $(S_{i - 1}) > (S_i)$, where $(a)$ denotes the fractional part of $a$. The probability that $x$ and $y$ are split should be $P(T \le (y - x))$ where $T$ is drawn from the stationary distribution of the $T_j$. I took a blind guess that the stationary distribution was given by the density $f(t) = 2(1 - t)$, drew a bunch of samples from the Markov chain I described, and verified empirically that $f(t) = 2 (1 - t)$ is the answer I'm supposed to get. If anyone wants to take a stab at verifying that $1 - (1 - |x - y|)_+^2$ is indeed the correct answer asymptotically, it would be much appreciated.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability']"

254944,Determining boundaries of Probability Density Function integral for a requested probability,"This isn't one specific homework question, but a concept I'm having trouble with in class. We were asked on a couple of questions recently on homework dealing with the probability density function of two random variables, $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$. We were given a joint probability density function and asked to find a given probability, like $P[X + Y > 5]$. One solid example being: Given a Joint PDF $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ let A be the event that $X + Y \leq 1$. Now, I know that $$P[A] = \int_A\int f_{X,Y}(x,y)dxdy$$ (at least, that's how my book writes it). My question is, how do I determine the bounds of those two integrals? In the solution manual for this particular problem, it is stated that the solution is $$P[X+Y\leq 1] = \int_0^1\int_0^{1-x}f_{X,Y}(x,y)dxdy$$ I can see pretty clearly that $x + (1-x)$ will always be less than or equal to one for $0 \leq x \leq 1$, so I understand why those bounds work. I'm just not sure I could have come up with them. Is there a process for figuring this out that I am missing? A similar question posed to us was given another joint PDF, let A be the event that $ X+Y>5$. I have no idea what the bounds would be for this one.

\mathbb{E}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i}]  =& \mathbb{E}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} \ \Bigg | \sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} < \infty] \mathbb{P}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} < \infty] + \mathbb{E}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} \ \Bigg | \sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} = \infty] \mathbb{P}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} = \infty] \end{align}$ and then say that since $\mathbb{E}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i}] < \infty$ I can then argue that the above conditions imply that $\mathbb{E}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} \ \Bigg | \sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} < \infty] \mathbb{P}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} < \infty] < \infty$ $\mathbb{E}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} \ \Bigg | \sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} = \infty] \mathbb{P}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} = \infty] < \infty$ Given that $\mathbb{E}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} \ \Bigg | \sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} = \infty] = \infty $, this must mean that $\mathbb{P}[\sum_{i=1}^\infty {X_i} = \infty] = 0$ Although this explanation makes sense intuitively, it doesn't seem formal enough (in particular it relies on the notion that $0 \times \infty = 0$).
