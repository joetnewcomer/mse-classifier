1175863,Number of visible elements in a permutation,"The following problem occurred to me the other day, and I've played around with a bit but can't seem to find a good solution: Consider a permutation $\pi$ of $\{1, 2,\ldots ,n\}$. For every positive integer $i$, $1\leq i\leq n$, we say that $i$ is visible if $\pi(i)>\pi(i+1), \pi(i+2),\ldots, \pi(n)$. ($n$ is always visible). What is the expected number of visible elements? I've tried bijecting the situation to something else, but I can't seem to find one that's actually easier to count. Any ideas?

Prove that the sequence $\{g(x)x^n\}$ converge uniformly on $[0,1]$. My attempt: Since $g$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ it is uniformly continuous on $[0,1]$. So $$\forall \; \epsilon >0, \exists \; \delta(\epsilon): |x-y|<\delta \, \Rightarrow \, |g(x)-g(y)|<\epsilon$$ It is clear that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}g(x)x^n=0$ for all $x \in [0,1]$. Then, i need to prove that, given $\epsilon > 0 $, there is a positive integer $N$ such that as $n \geq N$, then $|g(x)x^n|<\epsilon$. Since $g$ is continuous at $1$, then $$|x-1|<\delta \, \Rightarrow |g(x)-g(1)|=|g(x)|<\epsilon$$ So, we have $$|g(x)x^n|<|g(x)|<\epsilon,$$ but i'm stuck in the case $x \in [0,1)$","['uniform-convergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

1175922,Exercise in Hahn-Banach Theorem; Finding linear functional $-p(-x)\leq f(x)\leq p(x)$,"(The following exercises are in
Kreyszig's book 218 page; EXE 10) I want to solve the following
exercise : If $X=l^\infty$ , let $p(x)=\lim\sup x_i $ , which is
sublinear. Then find a linear functional $f(x)$ s.t. $$ -p(-x)\leq
f(x) \leq p(x)$$ Background : If $p$ is a sublinear function on
a real vector space, i.e., $$ p(x+y)\leq p(x) + p(y),\ p(cx)=cp(x),\ c\geq 0 $$ then there exists linear functional $f$ s.t. $$ -p(-x)\leq f(x) \leq
p(x) $$ Proof : By Hahn-Banach theorem we have $f(x)\leq p(x)
$ so that $$ f(-x)\leq p(-x)$$ That is $$ -p(-x)\leq f(x) \leq f(x)$$ Now, we return to original question : $X=l^\infty$ , let $p(x)=\limsup x_i $ . So $$-p(-x)=-\limsup (-x_i)=\liminf x_i$$ Hence if such functional $f$ exists, then $f(x)=\lim x_i$ when $\lim x_i$ exists. If $x_{2i+1}=2,\ x_{2i}=1$ then $v_{2i+1}=1,\ v_{2i}=2$ then $ f(x+v)=3 $ . That is, the problem
is how determine $f$ on $x$ where $\lim x_i$ does not exist. Try : If we let $f(x)=\frac{\lim\inf x_i + \lim\sup x_i}{2} $ , then note
that $f(x+v)\neq f(x)+f(v)$ . Thank you in advance.","['normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

1176098,What are some rigorous definitions for sine and cosine?,"Here are some of my ideas: 1.

Taylor Series: $\displaystyle{\sin x = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}\;x^{2n+1}}$ $\displaystyle{\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!}\;x^{2n}}$ 3. Differential Equations: $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ are the unique solutions to $y'' = -y$ , where $\sin(0) = \cos^\prime(0) = 0$ and $\sin^\prime(0) = \cos(0) = 1$ . 4. Inverse Formula: We have: $$\begin{align}

1176117,The order of subgroup generated by two distinct elements of order 2,"$G$ is a group of order $2$6.

By Lagrange's theorem, $\langle x\rangle$ and $\langle y\rangle$ are subgroups of $\langle x,y\rangle$, so order $\langle x,y\rangle$ has to be divisible by $2$. $\langle x,y\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$, so the possibilities are $2$, $13$, $26$. Since $13$ is not divisible by $2$, and $x,y$ have order $2$, so $x,y$ are not identities and hence order of $\langle x,y\rangle = 26$. Is something wrong with my proof?

1176119,Clarification of vector valued forms (sections and tensor products),"I am seeking a bit of clarification on vector valued forms. Intuitively, a vector valued differential form is a differential form on $M$ whose values lie in some vector space. More accurately, Let $\pi:E\rightarrow M$ be a vector bundle. An $E$-valued differential $k$-form $\omega$ is a member of the space $
\begin{align*}\Gamma\left(E\otimes \Lambda^k(T^*M)\right)&=\Gamma\left(E\otimes \bigsqcup_{q\in M}\Lambda^k(T_q^*M)\right).
\end{align*}$ My first question: Is this to mean that for $q\in M$, $
\begin{align*}
\omega(q)\in \pi^{-1}(q)\otimes(\Lambda^k(T_q^*M))=E_q\otimes (\Lambda^k(T_q^*M))?
\end{align*}
$ Furthermore, is it true to say that if $(e_i)_{i=1}^n$ is a basis for $E_q$ and if $M$ is $m$-dimensional, then $
\begin{align*}
E_q\otimes (\Lambda^k(T_q^*M))&=\text{span}\left\{e_i\otimes dx^{i_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k}\right\}, \quad 1\leq i \leq n,\quad 1\leq i_1<\cdots <i_k \leq m,
\end{align*}
$ Where $e_i\otimes dx^{i_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k}$ is the multi-linear map $
\begin{align*}
E_q^*\times \underset{k\text{ times}}{\underbrace{{T_q M\times\cdots\times T_q M}}}&\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\\
\\
(\eta^*,X_1,\dots,X_k)&\mapsto e_i(\eta^*)\cdot dx^{i_1}\wedge\dots\wedge dx^{i_k}(X_1,\dots,X_k),\quad \eta^*\in E_q^*,\quad X_1,\dots,X_k\in T_p M.
\end{align*}
$ I'm not sure if the above is correct - it's the only way I could really make sense  of the tensor product of the two spaces. If someone could clarify any misunderstandings that would be great. My second question: Is the reason why $\omega$ is a 'vector valued form' because it is a linear combination of the quantities $e_i\otimes dx^{i_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx^{i_k}$, thus, we can write $\omega(\cdot,X_1,\dots,X_k)=\alpha^i e_i$. I kind of see this as, the $dx^i$-s spit out a real number after putting the $k$ vectors in and these are just the coefficients of the remaining $e_i$-s. My overriding question comes from the fact that I have learnt that $V\otimes W$ is the set of linear combinations of $v_i\otimes w_j$ where $(v_i)$ and $(w_j)$ are bases for the vector spaces. So it is logical to me that the tensor product $E_q\otimes (\Lambda^k(T^*_q M))$ is the span of elements of the form `basis of $E_q\,\otimes$ basis of $\Lambda^k(T_q^* M)$' - if that makes any sense at all. Given that the basis of $\Lambda^k(T^*_q M)$ is the set of all $dx^{i_1}\wedge\dots\wedge dx^{i_k}$ such that $i_j$-s are increasing, this is where my question originates.","['vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-forms', 'manifolds', 'tensor-products']"

1176195,Would you ever stop rolling the die? [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Toss a fair die until the cumulative sum is a perfect square-Expected Value (1 answer) Closed 9 years ago . You have a six-sided die. You keep a cumulative total of your dice rolls. (E.g. if you roll a 3, then a 5, then a 2, your cumulative total is 10.) If your cumulative total is ever equal to a perfect square, then you lose, and you go home with nothing. Otherwise, you can choose to go home with a payout of your cumulative total, or to roll the die again. My question is about the optimal strategy for this game. In particular, this means that I am looking for an answer to this question: if my cumulative total is $n$, do I choose to roll or not to roll in order to maximize my cumulative total? Is there some integer $N$ after which the answer to this question is always to roll? I think that there is such an integer, and I conjecture that this integer is $4$. My reasoning is that the square numbers become sufficiently sparse for the expected value to always be in increased by rolling the die again. As an example, suppose your cumulative total is $35$. Rolling a $1$ and hitting 36 means we go home with nothing, so the expected value of rolling once is: $$E(Roll|35) = \frac 0 6 + \frac {37} 6 + \frac {38} 6 + \frac{39} 6 + \frac {40} {6} + \frac{41}{6} = 32.5$$ i.e. $$E(Roll|35) = \frac 1 6 \cdot (37 + 38 + 39 + 40 + 41) = 32.5$$ But the next square after $35$ is $49$. So in the event that we don't roll a $36$, we get to keep rolling the die at no risk as long as the cumulative total is less than $42$. For the sake of simplification, let's say that if we roll and don't hit $36$, then we will roll once more. That die-roll has an expected value of $3.5$. This means the expected value of rolling on $35$ is: $$E(Roll|35) = \frac 1 6 \cdot (40.5 + 41.5 + 42.5 + 43.5 + 44.5) = 35.42$$ And since $35.42 > 35$, the profit-maximizing choice is to roll again. And this strategy can be applied for every total. I don't see when this would cease to be the reasonable move, though I haven't attempted to verify it computationally. I intuitively think about this in terms of diverging sequences. I recently had this question in a job interview, and thought it was quite interesting. (And counter-intuitive, since this profit-maximizing strategy invariably results in going home with nothing.)","['gambling', 'discrete-mathematics', 'probability', 'expectation']"

But when dealing with high order TV, there are some problem. At first we assume that p is even. First I define $$\xi_i=|B_{\frac{i+1}{n}}-B_{\frac{i}{n}}|^p$$ then we can get that $$E[\xi_i]=\left(\frac1n\right)^{\frac p2}(p-1)!!$$ and $$E[\xi_i^2]=\left(\frac1n\right)^{p}(2p-1)!!$$ Next, we define $V_n=\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}\xi_i$ Then we have$$E[V_n]=\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}\left(\frac 1n\right)^{\frac p2}(p-1)!!$$ But there's something wrong in the following step, when calculating $E[V_n^2]$

Notice that the set $Z(x)$ is equivalent to the set  of $g$ in $G$ such that $ gxg^{-1}=x $.

Then $|Z(z)|$ would be equivalent to $|Z(x)|$ because $Z(z)= \{ h \in G | hzh^{-1} =z \}$. This can be shown by letting $g=aha^{-1}$ in the previous equation, giving a bijection. Similarly, we can show that $|Z(z)|= |Z(y)|$. Hence, $|z_c|=|Z(z)|=|Z(x)|=|Z(y)|.$ For the second part, we use the orbit-stabilizer theorem.

1176779,"If ${a}$ is an arbitrary integer, then prove that ${360|a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)}$.","I think I have solved the problem. I want to verify my proof, since I don't have a teacher to help me. Proof: 
Since, ${360=8*45}$ and ${gcd(45,8)=1}$, hence if we can prove that ${45|a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)}$ and ${8|a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)}$ , then we are done proving the question. Now, to prove divisibility by ${45}$, we see that ${45=9*5}$, also ${gcd(9,5)=1}$ and thus we can prove divisibility by ${45}$ if we can prove ${9|a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)}$ and ${5|a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)}$. Since ${a}$ is an arbitrary integer, it may be represented as ${2k}$ or ${2k+1}$.
So, ${a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)=a^2(a+1)(a-1)(a+2)(a-2)}$ may be represented as ${4k^2(2k+1)(2k-1)(2k+2)(2k-2)=16k^3(2K-1)(2k+1)(k+1)}$, which is divisible by ${8}$.
Similarly, for ${a=2k+1}$, we prove the divisibility by substituting $a$ by ${2k+1}$ to get ${(2k+1)^2(2k+2)(2k)(2k+3)(2k-1)=4k(k+1)(2k+1)^2(2k-1)(2k+3)}$ which is divisible by ${8}$.
Therefore ${8|a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)}$ .
Similarly, to prove divisibility by $9$, we represent $a$ by ${3k}$, ${3k+1}$ and ${3k+2}$ and prove divisibility for all of them in a similar manner.
Same method is used to prove divisibility by $5$ by represent $a$ by $5k,5k+1,5k+2,5k+3,5k+4$ and prove divisibility for all of these cases.
(While doing in paper, I actually prove these divisibilities.)
Hence, ${8|a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)}$ and ${45|a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)}$.
Since, $gcd(8,45)=1$, so ${(8*45)|a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)}$ .
Therefore, it is proved that ${360|a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)}$ . Now, please tell me if my method is correct or not. If incorrect, then please show me how to solve it properly otherwise please show me how to improve my solution. Thank you! :)","['elementary-number-theory', 'divisibility', 'number-theory']"

The ""traditional coupon collecting problem"" can be summarized as follows:
Assume we have a variable numbers $n$ of draws  from a non-depleting set of coupons (urn with coupons distributed as $\mathbf p$). We can count the drawn numbers of coupons according the different kinds of coupons in $\mathcal B$ with a occupancy vector $(X_1,X_2,..X_b)$, with $X_i$ is the number of coupons from type $i$, and $\sum_i X_i=n$.

Investigated, e.g. in [ 1 , 2 ]. A kind twisted problem I am interested in is the following: Assume we have a fixed number of $N$ draws from the urn of coupons with non-uniform distribution $\mathbf p$, can estimate or bound the number of coupon-types, which we will not observe in our $N$ draws? To be more formal, let $Y_i$ be an indicator variable with $Y_i=1$ for $X_i=0$ otherwise $Y_i=0$, and we are interested in $\mathbb E[G]$, where $G=\sum_i Y_i$.Evidently, for uniform distribution the expected number of vacancies in the occupancy vector will be minimal. In fact I am interested in bounding $\mathbb E[G]$ incorporating an information theoretic measure on $\mathbf p$, e.g. the entropy of the distribution $\mathbf p$, the total variation distance of $\mathbf p$ to uniform distribution or maybe some useful f-divergence. At least some bound dependend on maybe $\max_i p_i$ and $\min_i p_i$ would be helpful. If you have any idea how to tackle my problem, I am glad to hear your advice or answer.

I know that in the general case ($X$ a submanifold of a Riemannian manifold $M$) $N(X)$ trivial does not implies that $TX$ is trivial, my guess is that the answer to my question is NO, however the fact $T\mathbb{R}^N \vert_X$ is a trivial bundle and $N(X)$ is a sub bundle makes me feel that there might be a chance for $TX$ to be trivial. Basic linear algebra shows that if {$v_1,..v_q$} is a global orthonormal frame of $N(X)$ then locally we can produce a local orthonormal frame for $TX$, however I think that there are problems if we try to construct a global frame for $TX$, however I am not sure if using that $T\mathbb{R}^N \vert_X$ is trivial we can construct such a global frame for $TX$.

1177184,Definition of cartesian product,"I have some problem understanding some aspects of the definition of an arbitrary cartesian product. What I have so far: Let $\mathscr{A} = (A_s)_{s \in S}$ be a collection of sets. The
  cartesian product of the collection $\mathscr{A}$ is: $$\begin{align}
 \prod\mathscr{A} = \prod_{s \in S}A_s &:= \left\{ f: \mathscr{A} \to
 \bigcup_{s \in S}A_s \mid f(A) \in A, \, \forall\, A \in \mathscr{A} 
 \right\} \\ &= \left\{ f: S \to \bigcup_{s \in S}A_s \mid f(s) \in
 A_s, \forall\, s \in S \right\}\end{align}.
$$If $\mathscr{A} =\{A_1, \ldots A_n\}$, we will write $\prod\mathscr{A} = A_1 \times \cdots \times A_n$. By my understanding, I get that if $A$ and $B$ are sets, we have: $$A \times B = \{f: \{A,B\} \to A \cup B\mid f(A) \in A \text{ and }f(B) \in B\}$$ I am asked, then, to prove that given sets $A,B$ and $C$, we have $A \times(B \cup C) = (A \times B)\cup(A \times C)$. Doubt 1: How can I make the comparison if the domains of the elements on both sides are different? It does not make any sense at all. Suppose I don't care and go on: If $f \in A \times(B \cup C)$, then $f(A) \in A$ and $f(B \cup C) \in B \cup C$. I would think then, that if $f(B \cup C) \in B$, then $f \in A \times B$, and if $f(B \cup C)\in C$, we have $f \in A \times C$, so anyway we have the inclusion $\subseteq$. On the other hand, it suffices to prove that $A \times B \subseteq A \times(B \cup C)$ (WLOG). If $f \in A \times B$, then $f(A) \in A$ and $f(B) \in B \subset B \cup C$ and so $f \in A \times(B \cup C)$. I am not comfortable at all with this, since I do not have a rigorous definition of a functions, and the most formal one I know is that $f : A \to B$ is a function if $f \in A \times B$ satisfies blah blah blah. It is circular. Up next I am asked to prove that $A \times B = A \times C$ and $A \neq \varnothing$, then $B = C$. My idea consists mainly of the following: since $A \neq \varnothing$, then exists $a \in A$. Take $x \in B$, if I prove that $x \in C$ then I am done. Define $f:\{A, B\}\to A \cup B$ by setting $f(A) = a \in A$ and $f(B) = x \in B$. This way $f \in A \times B$, and by hypothesis $f \in A \times C$. I don't know how to give the next step in this argument. Doubt 2: Can't I just say that if $f \in A \times B = A \times B$ implies $\{A,B\}=\{A,C\}$ and $A \cup B = A \cup C$, based on domains and codomains, and from there try to get $B = C$?

1177377,Generalization of inner product spaces (analogue to uniform spaces/locally convex spaces),"In the following I am going to devise a chart of topological spaces that contains inner product spaces , normed vector spaces , metric spaces and other related spaces. In the end there will be a gap in the chart and, essentially, my question is how to fill this gap. Step 1: Spaces with positive definite structures A topological space can be generated, e. g., by some structure like inner products , norms and metrics . Inner products, norms and metrics have one property in common: They are positive definite. $\langle x,x\rangle \geq 0$ and $(\langle x,x\rangle =0 \implies x=0)$ $||x|| \geq 0$ and $(||x||=0 \implies x=0)$ $d(x,y) \geq 0$ and $(d(x,y)=0 \implies x=y)$ It is well known that each inner product induces a norm and each norm induces a metric . Step 2: Spaces with positive semi-definite structures If we relax the positive definite properties a bit, we are left with positive semi-definite structures: Instead of inner products we then have symmetric positive semi-definite bilinear forms (or hermitian positive semi-definite sesquilinear forms ). I'll call them semi-inner products below; please note that this name isn't used consistently in literature/internet. Instead of norms we then have semi-norms . Instead of metrics we then have pseudometrics . And again, one can show that each semi-inner product induces a semi-norm and each semi-norm induces a pseudometric. Step 3: Spaces with families of positive semi-definite structures The generalization of a metric space is called a uniform space . Uniform structures are connected to pseudometrics: one way to define uniform spaces is via a family of pseudometrics . See for example Bourbaki, General Topology II, Chapter IX, §1, section 2, Definition of a uniformity by means of a family of pseudometrics . The generalization of a normed vector space is called a locally convex space . Locally convex spaces can be defined by a family of semi-norms on a vector space. See for example the Wikipedia article on locally convex spaces . Locally convex spaces can be interpreted as a subclass of uniform spaces. Summary: Essentially, what we get is the following chart of structures and spaces, where every arrow can be read as ""is a/can be interpreted as a"": POS. DEF. STRUCTURE   |   POS. SEMI-DEF. STRUCTURE   |  FAM. OF POS. SEMI-DEF. STRUCTURES

1177738,Is there a simple way to know whether the collection of all objects of a certain type is a set?,"Please forgive me if this question seems really unsubstantial and only serves to expose my ignorance of set theory. I have seen some examples where considering the set of all objects of certain kind leads to a contradiction when using naive set theory (When the collection of all objects of a certain type is not a set). For example the collection of sets, ordinals, sets that don't contain themselves etc. For which objects is the collection of all of those objects a set? I realize this is ambiguous. So concretely can we answer the following? Is the collection of all topologies a set? Is the collection of all groups a set? Thank you kindly. Regards.",['elementary-set-theory']
1177742,Defining multiplication on the tensor product of $R$-algebras.,"If $M$ and $N$ are $R$-algebras, then one can define a multiplication of elementary tensors as follows; $(m \otimes n) \cdot (m' \otimes n') = mm' \otimes nn'$. My question is how can we show, using the universal property of the tensor product, that this is a well defined operation? My understanding is that we would be need a 4-linear map out of $(M \times N)\times (M \times N)$ into $M \otimes N$, that would factor through $(M \otimes N) \otimes (M \otimes N)$ giving us the required linear map. Am I on the right track? I can't seem to get my head around the details in the proof. Any pointers would be of great help to me.","['tensor-products', 'abstract-algebra']"
1177746,"What decides if a Coxeter Group is ""crystalline"" or ""non-crystalline""?","I am currently writing a research essay concerning Crystallographic theories applied to Virology. Do keep in mind that I am not a mathematician and I know very little about Coxeter groups in general. Please bear with me; I'm trying. One of my sources,""Mathematical Virology: a novel approach to the structure and assembly of viruses"" (Twarock 2006), draws a connection between the ""six-dimensional root lattice 6D and the non-crystallographic Coxeter group H3"". According to the paper, Twarock was able to use H3, and it's affine extension, to infer generalized lattices of the capsid structure. What distinct a 'non-crystallographic' Coxeter group from a 'crystallographic' one? Also, I believe ""affine extension"" to be an extension of an object that preserves the parallel relationship of its parts, sort of a scaling thing. Is this true? And is it correct to assume that Coxeter Groups are part of Group Theory? Thank you so much! P.S. If anyone knows anything about what exactly a ""six-dimensional root lattice 6D"" entails, I'd be thrilled to find out.","['coxeter-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
1177765,Find the limit of $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow0}\frac{x}{\tan x}$.,"Find the limit of $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow0}\frac{x}{\tan x}$ Clearly, since the limit takes the form of $\frac{0}{0}$, one should try L'Hopital's Rule. If we apply L'Hopital's Rule, the problem is that $\frac{d(\tan x)}{dx}=\cot x$, and $\cot(0)$ is undefined. Thus, we cannot find a limit using L'Hopital's Rule. My problem set suggests that this question can be answered using little more than L'Hopital and Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem. Not sure how to proceed.

1177782,Every bounded sequence has a weakly convergent subsequence in a Hilbert space,"I tried to prove the following theorem and was wondering if someone could please tell me if my proof can be fixed somehow... Theorem: Let $H$ be a Hilbert space and $x_n\in H$ a bounded sequence. Then $x_n$ has a weakly convergent subsequence. My idea for a proof: The map $\phi: H \to H^\ast$ in the Riesz representation theorem is an isometry therefore $\varphi_n := \phi(x_n)$ is also bounded and therefore $\varphi_1(x_n)$ is a bounded sequencein $\mathbb R$. By Bolzano Weierstras it ha a convergent subsequence $\varphi_1(x_{n_{k_1}})$. (Say, $\varphi_1(x_{n_{k_1}})\to \varphi_1(x)$ for some $x$) Let $x_{n_1}$ be the argument of the first element in this sequence (apologies for the notation; the first element is also called $x_{n_1}$...). The sequence $\varphi_2(x_{n_1})$ has a convergent subsequence $x_{n_{k_2}}$. Let $x_{n_2}$ be the first element in that sequence. And so on. Then the resulting sequence $x_{n_k}$ has the property that for all $j$: $$ \varphi_j(x_{n_k}) \to \varphi_j(x)$$ My only problem is that I only showed this limit for $\varphi_n$ that is, not for all $\varphi \in H^\ast$. Can this argument be fixed somehow?","['weak-convergence', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
1177788,Beppo Levi's theorem,"Let $f_n$ is a sequence of integrable functions and $\sup_n\int f_n d\mu<\infty$. I need to show that, if $f_n\uparrow f$, then $f$ is integrable and $\int f_nd\mu \rightarrow \int fd\mu$. This is claimed to be named as ""Beppo Levi's theorem"". It is not stated that $f_n$ are non-negative or non-negative a.e., so it is clearly not the same assumptions of Monotone convergence theorem. I have no clue how to show the convergence of the integral in case of the above assumptions, and not the non-negativeness assumption.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'integration']"
