470286,Identification of a curious function,"During computation of some Shapley values (details below), I encountered the following function: $$
f\left(\sum_{k \geq 0} 2^{-p_k}\right) = \sum_{k \geq 0} \frac{1}{(p_k+1)\binom{p_k}{k}},
$$ where $p_0 > 0$ and $p_{k+1} > p_k$ for all $k$ . In other words, the input to $f$ is the binary expansion of a real number in the range $[0,1]$ , and the $p_k$ correspond to the positions of $1$ s in the binary expansion. For example, $f(2^{-t}) = 1/(t+1)$ , so $f(1/2) = 1/2$ , $f(1/4) = 1/3$ and so on. More complicated examples are $f(5/8) = f(2^{-1} + 2^{-3}) = 1/2 + 1/(4\cdot 3) = 7/12$ and $$ f(2/3) = f\left(\sum_{k \geq 0}2^{-(2k+1)}\right) = \sum_{k \geq 0} \frac{1}{(2k+2)\binom{2k+1}{k}} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{27}}.$$ The function $f$ is a continuous increasing function satisfying $f(0) = 0$ , $f(1) = 1$ , and $f(1-t) = 1-f(t)$ for $t \in [0,1]$ . It has vertical asymptotes at dyadic points. Here is a plot of $f$ : Is the function $f$ known? Here is where $f$ came from. Let $n \geq 1$ be an integer and let $t \in [0,1]$ . For a permutation $\pi$ of the numbers $\{ 2^{-m} : 0 \leq m \leq n-1 \}$ satisfying $\pi^{-1}(1) = i$ , we say that $\pi$ is pivotal if $\sum_{j<i} \pi(j) < t$ . Let $f_n(t)$ be the probability that a random $\pi$ is pivotal. Then $f(t) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f_n(t)$ . For example, take $n = 4$ . The permutation $1/8,1/2,1,1/4$ is pivotal for $t \in (5/8,1]$ . For all $n \geq 2$ we have $f_n(1/2) = 1/2$ , since $\pi$ is pivotal iff $1$ appears before $1/2$ in $\pi$ . The general formula for $f$ is derived in a similar way. We leave it to the reader to figure out how $f_n$ measures some Shapley value. The functions $f_n$ are step functions with steps of length $1/2^{n-1}$ . They are left-continuous, and are equal to $f$ at the breakpoints. This question was also asked on MO .","['game-theory', 'special-functions', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'functions']"

Thoughts: For an integral domain $R$, I know that $X$ is irreducible and reduced; in particular, every open set is dense in $X$. Hence the limit in question is just the fraction field of $R$, right?

470363,Prove $\mathbb{R}^3$ is not the product of two identical topological spaces,"I can only prove this for $\mathbb{R}$: If $\mathbb{R}\cong T\times T$, then $T$ embeds in $\mathbb{R}$ as a closed subspace (e.g. $T\times pt$). Since $\mathbb{R}$ is connected, so is $T$. So $T$ must be a closed interval, then $T\times T$ is a square, a close quarter of $\mathbb{R}^2$, or $\mathbb{R}^2$, all impossible. But when it comes to $\mathbb{R}^3$, I don't know how to characterize closed connected subspaces, and cannot use this to produce some useful assertions. P.S.

470383,How to decide convergence or otherwise of these series?,"How to decide whether the following three series converge or diverge? $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{\sqrt{n} + (-1)^n} $$
By the limit comparison with the divergent series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ we can say that this series is not absolutely convergent. However since $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}+(-1)^n} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}+(-1)^{n+1}} = \frac{ \sqrt{n+1} - \sqrt{n} + 2 (-1)^{n+1}}{(\sqrt{n}+(-1)^n)(\sqrt{n+1}+(-1)^{n+1})},$$ which is positive if $n$ is odd but negative if $n$ is even. So we can't apply the Leibnitz's rule. $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\log ( e^n + e^{-n} ) } $$ 
By the Leibnitz's rule we can conclude that the corresponding alternating series converges (conditionally). $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n \int_{n}^{n+1} \frac{e^{-x}}{x} \ dx $$ The integral here satisfies the inequalities $$ \frac{e^{-n}-e^{-n-1}}{n+1} \leq \int_{n}^{n+1} \frac{e^{-x}}{x} \ dx  \leq \frac{e^{-n}-e^{-n-1}}{n}, $$ and both the upper and lower bounds approach $0$ as $n$ increases without bound.

470411,Why should the substitution be injective when integrating by substitution?,"I made a silly mistake in evaluating some integral by using a non-injective $u$-substitution.  But why should $u$-substitutions be injective in the first place? I reasoned in the following way: the formula
$$
\int_{\phi(a)}^{\phi(b)}g(x)\ dx = \int_a^b g(\phi(t))\phi^\prime(t)\ dt
$$
holds for a general $C^1$ function $\phi$, even if it is not injective.  When you calculate an integral of the form $\int_a^b f(\phi(t))\ dt$, to use the formula above from right to left , you should find a function $f$ such that
$$
f(\phi(t)) = g(\phi(t))\phi^\prime(t),
$$
which do not exist if $\phi$ is not injective, i.e., $\phi(t) = 0$ for some $t$. This is why substitutions should be injective. Is my reasoning correct?  If so, I believe that if $\phi^\prime(t) = 0 \Rightarrow f(\phi(t)) = 0$, a function $g$ that satisfies the formula above may exist and $\phi$ should not necessarily be injective.  Is this right? I am often confused about the fact $\phi$ should be injective.  Is there an intuitive way to interpret this fact, so that I always remember to take a $\phi$ that is injective?

470464,When characteristic classes determine a bundle?,"Let $k$ be a natural number and $F$ be $\mathbb C$ or $\mathbb R$. What conditions should be imposed on a topological space that it was true that a $k$-dimensional vector bundle defined over $F$ on this space is determined by its characteristic classes (Chern or Stiefel-Whitney and Pontrjagin classes)? For example, in the case of complex line bundles it is enough to have $H^1(X,\mathbb C)=0.$ This comes from the exponential sequence which doesn't exist in higher dimension. Perhaps for $k>1$ this question is difficult to answer in general, so I'll be more specific. Is it true for compact simply-connected oriented smooth 4-manifolds that a real 4-dimensional vector bundle is determined by its Stiefel-Whitney and Pontrjagin classes?
This would give a partial answer to my yesterday's question ( Tangent bundles of exotic manifolds ) since in this case characteristic classes of tangent bundle give a purely topological information (signature, Euler number and diagonal of the intersection form mod $2$). It seems well known that over complex projective space (and even over Grassmannian) in each dimension a complex vector bundle is determined by its total Chern class. Is it true in the real case (or in the mixed case of complex bundles over real Grassmannians or vice versa)? Can we say something about another algebraic varieties?","['characteristic-classes', 'vector-bundles', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-topology']"

I've searched and found similar questions here and in MO, but none of them contains a valid proof. ( Does $S_n$ belong as a subgroup to $A_{n+1}$ ? ) According to Rotman, a valid proof can only use the concepts introduced up to this exercise: cycle permutations, factorization of permutations, odd and even permutations, semigroups, groups, homomorphism and subgroups. Cosets, Lagrange's theorem, normal subgroups, and so on are not yet introduced. I stress this point because all of the proofs I've seen use Lagrange or actions, on cosets. Now my attempt is to use exercise 2.7 (solved) which is about a proof that $A_n$ ( $n>2$ ) is generated by all the $3$ -cycles and exercise 2.4 (solved) "" if $S$ is a proper subgroup of $G$ then $\langle G \setminus S\rangle=G$ "" in this way: Suppose that for every $\phi  : S_n \to A_{n+1}$ imbeddings, all the $ 3$ -cycles are contained in $\operatorname{Im}\phi $ , then the assertion is proved by absurd. But I can't find a way to prove if it is possible or either find a counterexample to this kind of approach.

470621,Almost sure convergence of generalized random harmonic series,"Problem. Prove that
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} \cos(2 \pi \cdot2^{n^2} x)$$
converges for almost every $x \in [0, 1]$ (with Lebesgue measure). (Credits to B. Tsirelson.) My partial solution. I can apply the Kolmogorov Three-Series theorem to the series
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} \cos(2 \pi Y_n)$$
where
$$Y_n = [ 2^{n^2} x ] - \frac{[2^{(n+1)^2} x]}{2^{2n + 1}}$$
$$[y] = y - \lfloor y \rfloor$$
Then each $Y_n$ is a function of the $n^2$ till $(n+1)^2 - 1$ binary digits of $x$ and thus independent variables. Now, the problem is that I do not know how to imply the convergence of the series in question. Is it some series comparison test? Unfortunately the terms of the series change signs... and all relevant theorems we studied can't be applied to the original series because they assume the terms are independent, which is not the case.

The answer is to his question is yes, by the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, as noted in the answer by Anjan Gupta. Even though I don't know the first thing about categories -- except for the things that I do know -- I'm wondering if and how such property could be expressed and proven in terms of universal properties, without actually manoevring inside the objects. For instance one may attempt to create a morphism $G\to H$ somehow appealing to the universal property of $\oplus$, and subsequently show this morphism is an isomorphism by chasing diagrams. But it seems likely that the existence of a structure theorem of some sort will be required. This question may be considered trivial or weird for someone who's fluent with categories, I don't know. This topic contains quite a few references. I haven't really worked through any of them (yet) but I couldn't find anything helpful at first sight. -- edit, So a more precise title would have been ""Under what conditions that can be expressed in a universal way does $G\oplus G\cong H\oplus H$ imply $G\cong H$ ?"" but I don't like long titles. -- edit2, By the comment by Alexei Averchenko, maybe It's more natural to ask this question with the product instead of the coproduct.

470668,Application of Schwartz Kernel Theorem to Quantum Mechanics,"I am currently reading Quantum Mechanics for Mathematicians and have a question about a statement made in the book: Remark. By the Schwartz kernel theorem, the operator B can be represented by an integral operator with distributional kernel $K(q,q')$. Then the commutativity $BQ = QB$ implies that, in the distributional sense, $$
(q-q')K(q,q') = 0,
$$ so that $K$ is ""proportional"" to the Dirac delta-function, i .e., 
$$
K(q,q') = f(q)\delta(q-q'). 
$$
This argument is usually given in physics textbooks. $B$ and $Q$ are both operators in the coordinate representation. $Q$ is the position operator and $B$ is bounded. So, first of all, I can't find much about the kernel theorem online. I've been using this as a reference . According to this document, there is a relation between bilinear forms and distributions. However, I don't know how to view $B$ as a bilinear form and thus apply the theorem. Can someone elucidate how the kernel theorem is applicable to $B$?

  extreme solution of these inclusions.  This means that if  $X_j \subset Y$ for each index $j$, then $\bigcup_i X_i \subset Y$ and
  $\bigcup_i X_i$ is the only set satisfying this minimality condition;
  the formulation for intersection is similar. The first part is pretty easy to prove. Suppose that $z\in \bigcap_i X_i.$ Then for each $i\in I$, we have that $z\in X_i$. So, clearly if $j\in I$ that means $z\in X_j$;  which prove the first inclusion, $\bigcap_i X_i \subset X_j.$ Now suppose that $z\in X_j$. Then, $z\in X_i$ for at least one $i\in I$, i.e.,  $z\in \bigcup_i X_i$; which prove the second inclusion $X_j \subset \bigcup_i X_i$ So my question in specific is about the last part, where Halmos says: ""if  $X_j \subset Y$ for each index $j$, then $\bigcup_i X_i \subset Y$ and $\bigcup_i X_i$ is the only set satisfying this minimality condition"".

Then the corresponding sequence $\{f_n\}$ (unique up to constants) contains a subsequence that converges to some analytic $f$. This implies that the subsequence of derivatives converges to $f'$, so every sequence in $\mathscr{F}'$ has a subsequence that converges and $\mathscr{F}'$ is normal. Am I missing something here?

My proof:
Let $F$ be an eigenvector of $T$. This means $\exists \; \lambda \in R$ such that $T(v)=\lambda v$. Then, using the fact that $S\circ T$=$T \circ S$, we have $$ S(T(v)) = (S\circ T)(v)=(T \circ S)(v)=T(S(v)) \Longrightarrow T(S(v))=\lambda S(v)$$ Thus, $S(v)$ is also an eigenvector of $T$. So, $S$ maps eigenvectors of $T$ to eigenvevtors of $T$. Thus, $S$ must have an eigenvector of $T$. How would one rigorously prove that if $S$ maps eigenvectors of $T$ to eigenvectors of $T$, then $S$ also has an eigenvector of $T$?

Apologies for the probably quite elementary question; I'm an applied mathematician, and am aiming to be well-read in a range of mathematical topics for my own interest, and while I have a textbook I'm working through on the topic of differentiable manifolds, there's still a certain unfamiliarity with the methods employed in certain pure maths topics.

470822,Curvature Using Circles,"Given the equation $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$ representing the family of all circles of radius r at the point $(h,k)$ if we try to form the differential equation representing this family we find an equation of the form $$\kappa = \frac{1}{r} = \frac{y''}{\sqrt{(1 + y'^2)^3}}$$ which is surprisingly the equation for the curvature of a plane curve (ignoring absolute values which arise in the derivation). But this expression was derived interpreting $y$ as part of a circle, how in the world can one justify plugging in other functions & saying this represents the curvature of that curve at the point?

$T:H \rightarrow H$  such that $T(i_k) = a_ki_k$ given that ($a_k$), $\forall k \in \mathbb{N}$ is bounded. We want to find $||T||$. We know that $||T|| = \sup\{||Tx||: x \in H, ||x|| \le 1\}$. For any given $x \in H$ we can write $x = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (x, i_n)i_n $, therefore $||x||^2 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty |(x,i_n)|^2$ and by Cauchy-Schwarz we have $|(x,i_n)| \le ||x||$. I suspect that $||T|| = sup_k |a_k|$ thinking about it intuitively but not sure how to show that. Since we know T is linear then: $Tx = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (x, i_n)Ti_n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (x, i_n)a_ni_n.$ From this $||Tx||^2 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty |(x, i_n)|^2|a_ni_n|^2 \le (sup|a_n|)^2||x||^2$ by Bessel inequality, then $||T|| \le sup|a_n|.$ If this is correct, how could we show equality?","['operator-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"

470914,A general explicit formula for the generalized divisor summatory function?,"Mertens function has, by residues, an explicit formula of $M(x)=\displaystyle\sum_{\rho}\frac{x^\rho}{\rho\zeta'(\rho)}-2+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^{2 n}(2\pi)^{2n}}{(2n)! n \zeta(2n+1)x^{2n}}$ where $\rho$ are the zeros of $\zeta(s)$, as usual. Meanwhile, if we use this generalized identity for the number of divisors function, $d_z(n)=\displaystyle\prod_{p^\alpha | n}\frac{(z)(z+1)..(z+\alpha-1)}{\alpha!}$, it's not much work to see that the Moebius function $\mu(n)$ is equal to $d_{-1}(n)$, and with $D_z(n) = \sum_{j=1}^n d_z(j)$, that $M(n) = D_{-1}(n)$. Is there an explicit formula, similar to that of $M(n)$, above, for the more general case of $D_z(n)$ that the formula for $M(n)$ is a specialization of? Some more detail, in response to Eric N.: I understand that we can't use residues to get an explicit formula, for the reasons mentioned.  But does that lead naturally to the idea that there isn't / couldn't be explicit formulas for $D_k(n), k>0$ that use the Zeta Zeros? I want to make a visual, intuitive argument here.  Here's an identity for $D_z(n)$ for complex z. $\displaystyle D_z(n) = \frac{z^0}{0!}1+\frac{z^1}{1!}\sum_{j=2}^n \kappa(j)+\frac{z^2}{2!}\sum_{j=2}^n \sum_{k=2}^{\lfloor \frac{n}{j} \rfloor} \kappa(j) \kappa(k)+\frac{z^3}{3!}\sum_{j=2}^n \sum_{k=2}^{\lfloor \frac{n}{j} \rfloor}\sum_{l=2}^{\lfloor \frac{n}{j k} \rfloor} \kappa(j) \kappa(k) \kappa(l)+\frac{z^4}{4!}...$ where $\kappa(n) = \frac{\Lambda(n)}{\log n}$.
Define $\displaystyle P_k(n)=\sum_{j=2}^{n}\kappa(j) P_{k-1}(\lfloor \frac{n}{j} \rfloor)$ with $P_0(n)=1$, and restate that as $\displaystyle D_z(n) = \frac{z^0}{0!}P_0(n)+\frac{z^1}{1!}P_1(n)+\frac{z^2}{2!}P_2(n)+\frac{z^3}{3!}P_3(n)+\frac{z^4}{4!}P_4(n)+...$ $P_k(n) = 0$ if $n < 2^k$, so only $\log_2 n$ terms are non-zero.  This means, if you've computed those non-zero $P_k(n)$ terms, it's trivial to compute $D_z(n)$ for any z in $\log_2 n$ operations. Now, use this identity to animate, in Mathematica, $\displaystyle\frac{(D_z(n)-1)}{z}$ over the range $z = 1$ to $z = -1$. K[n_] := FullSimplify[MangoldtLambda[n]/Log[n]] P[n_, k_] := P[n, k] = Sum[ K[j] P[Floor[n/j], k - 1], {j, 2, n}];P[n_, 0] := 1 DD[n_, k_] := Sum[ k^j/j! P[n, j], {j, 0, Log[2, n]}] Animate[DiscretePlot[ (DD[n, z =  Cos[k] ] - 1)/z, {n, 1, 100}], {k, 0, 2 Pi, .0001}] What you'll see, if you watch this animation, is an animating line that starts as f(x)=(x-1), races down and at its fastest is the Riemann Prime Counting function right when z=0, and then finally comes to a halt at (1-Mertens Function), before it cycles back up - all in all, a nice gradual transformation between those three important functions. I know it's only an appeal to visuals, but I feel like what's going on at $D_{-.2}(n)/-.2$ looks continuous with what's going on at $D_{.2}(n)/.2$.  Here's a closer look at that. Animate[DiscretePlot[(DD[n, z = Cos[k]*.2] - 1)/z, {n, 1, 400}], {k, 0, 2 Pi, .0001}] I guess anything's possible, but it deeply offends my senses of symmetry to think the Zeta Zeros are accounting for the high frequency part of the line there, from -.2 to 0, and then in the blink of an eye, something else is accounting for what is almost the exact same high frequency information.  Are my instincts wrong? A Few More Notes About All This That identity for $D_z(n)$ stems from Linnik's identity summed, inverted, and generalized a bit.  There's a corresponding identity for $d_z(n)$ as well. In the notation above, $P_1(n) = \Pi(n)$, the Riemann Prime Counting Function. As was casually demonstrated above, $\displaystyle \lim_{z \to 0}\frac{D_z(n)-1}{z} = \Pi(n)$. You can get this last result more easily by taking $d_z(n)=\displaystyle\prod_{p^\alpha | n}\frac{(z)(z+1)..(z+\alpha-1)}{\alpha!}$ and noting that $\displaystyle \lim_{z \to 0}\frac{d_z(n)}{z} = \frac{\Lambda(n)}{\log n}$ except at 1, where the limit is infinity.","['analytic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

471146,Horizontal bundle and the notion of connection,"Jost explains (in Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis ) the term connection with the direct sum of the tangent space to a vector bundle $T_eE=V_e\oplus H_e$ as follows. Let $E$ be a vector bundle with connection $\nabla$, $e\in\Gamma(E)$ and $x=\pi(e)\in M$, $M$ manifold. Considering the tangent space $T_e E$ there is a distinguished subspace, the vertical space $V_e$, namely the tangent space $T_eE_x$ to the fiber $E_x\subset E$. However, there is no distinguished ""horizontal space"" $H_e$ complementary to $V_e$, i.e. satisfying $T_eE=V_e\oplus H_e$. If we have a connection $\nabla$, however, we can parallely transport $e$ for each $X\in T_xM$ along a curve $c(t)$ with $c(0)=x,~\dot{c}(0)=X$. Thus, for each $X$, we obtain a curve $e(t)$ in $E$. The subspace of $T_eE$ spanned by all tangent vectors to $E$ at $e$ of the form $$\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}e(t)\right|_{t=0}$$
  then is the horizontal space $H_e$. In this manner, one obtains a rule for how the fibers in neighboring points are ""connected"" with each other. First (and probably very naive), with this definition of $H_e$ it is not clear to me why the direct sum $T_eE=V_e\oplus H_e$ does hold. Why is $\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}e(t)\right|_{t=0}\notin T_eE_x=V_e$ true? Second, I cannot really make sense of the term connection with this direct sum in mind. Many other authors (e.g. J.M. Lee) refer the term connection to the isomorphism between fibers given by parallel transport along a curve $c$, $P_{c,t}:E_{c(0)}\to E_{c(t)}$ which seems to explain the connection better. So, I would like to know: What exactly is meant by ""a rule"" for how the fibers are connected with each other? I have read, that the concept of vertical and horizontal (sub-)bundle is closely related to an Ehresmann connection, but since I am unaware of this notion, I would prefer answers not using Ehresmann connection.

471296,A functional structure on the graph of the absolute value function,"Let $X$ be the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$ consisting of the graph of the absolute value function. That is, $X=\{(x,|x|) : x\in\mathbb{R})\}$. We define a functional structure on $X$ by restricting smooth real valued functions defined on open subsets of the plane: an open set $U\subset X$ has the form $U=V\cap X$, where $V\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is open. Then define $f\in F(U)$ iff $f=g|_{U}$, where $g$ is a smooth real value function on $V$. E.g., The function $\pi_{2}(x,y)=y$ is smooth on any neighborhood $V$ of the origin. Therefore, its restriction to $U=V\cap X$ is in $F(U)$ (note that the restriction is not smooth at the origin). Question: Is $\mathbf{X}$ with the functional structure $\mathbf{F}$ a differentiable manifold? (Defining smooth manifolds via functional structures: here ). It seems to me that it is not a differentiable manifold. I tried showing that at the origin it is not locally isomorphic to $(\mathbb{R},C^{\infty})$ (the real line with the functional structure of smooth real valued functions). Assuming that there is a local isomorphism at the origin I was trying to get to a contradiction more or less using functions such as $\pi_{2}$ above, which are not smooth when restricted to $X$. Nothing has worked so far... Note: Clearly $X$ is not a manifold in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. This is discussed for example in this and this posts.","['general-topology', 'sheaf-theory', 'manifolds', 'differential-topology']"

471303,$\mathbb S^3=\mathbb R\mathrm P^3$? Find mistake in the proof.,"It is known that the sphere $\mathbb S^3$ may be decomposed as two solid tori. It may be done with the following ""parametrization"" $f:(\mathbb S^1\times \mathbb  S^1 \times [0,1])_{/\sim}\to \mathbb S^3\subseteq \mathbb R^4$:
$$f(\alpha, \beta , t) = (\cos \frac{t\pi}{2} \cdot \alpha,\ \sin \frac{t\pi}{2} \cdot \beta).$$ There must be a mistake somewhere, but I can't find it: I parametrized $\textrm{SO}(3)$ (which is the same as $\mathbb R\textrm P^3\neq \mathbb S^3$) in the same way. Any matrix from $\textrm{SO}(3)$ is uniquely determined by its two first columns. Assume that the first column $A$ is different from the poles $\pm(0,0,1)$. Then the second column $B$ can be described in terms of angle. Let's look at $B$ as a vector tangent to the sphere $\mathbb S^2$ at point $A$. Then, $0$-angle corresponds to vector $B$ pointing east, $\pi/2$ corresponds to $B$ pointing north and so on. So this part of $\textrm{SO}(3)$ may be paramtrized by $\mathbb S^2\setminus \{\pm(0,0,1)\} \times \mathbb S^1 \simeq (-1,1) \times \mathbb S^1 \times \mathbb S^1$ (with coordinate functions: $t,\varphi, \psi$). Now assume that $A=\pm(0,0,1)$. Parametrize $B$ with angle in the following way: $B(\phi)=(0,\cos(\phi+\frac{\pi}{2}), \sin(\phi+\frac{\pi}{2}))$. How to glue it with the previous one? Let: $$
B(-1,\varphi, \psi) = B(\varphi+\psi),\\
B(1, \varphi, \psi) = B(\varphi-\psi).$$ If we reparametrize the torus $\mathbb S^1\times \mathbb S^1$ with $\alpha = \varphi + \psi$ and $\beta = \varphi - \psi$, we can see that function $g=(A,B)(t,\alpha,\beta):[-1,1] \times \mathbb S^1 \times \mathbb S^1 \to \textrm{SO}(3)$ identifies the same points as $f$ did (with obvious corrections on order of the factors and length of the interval). The proof relies on the three: 1) any continuous map from a compact space $X$ onto a Hausdorff space $Y$ induces a homeo between the obvious quotient $X_{/\sim}$ and $Y$, 2) $B$ is continuous, 3) the identifications are the same.

471316,Calc III: Volume of the Intersection of two spheres,"Question: I am not getting the correct answer. How do I get the solution (and why does my solution not work?) Find volume that lies inside both spheres: \begin{align}
A: 4	&= (x+2)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z+2)^2\\
B: 4	&= x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\
\end{align} My solution gives the answer $V \approx 11$, whereas Chegg.com gives the answer $\frac{11}{24}\tau$, where $\tau = 2\pi$. However, I don't like their method because they pull the equation for the volume of the cap of a sphere out of thin-air with no explanation. I was hoping to find a more intuitive answer. The distance between the spheres is $d = \sqrt{2^2 + 1^2 + 2^2} = 3$, so I can replace these spheres with two similar spheres 3 units apart, lying along the $x$-axis. I project the spheres into the $xy$-plane. The line of intersection is $x = 1.5$. Next, I integrate over $x: [1.5 , 2]$ by volume of rotation using the disc method: $ V = \tau \int f(x) \ dx$. This should give the volume of half of the volume inside both spheres. If I double the integral, I should get the entire volume, so: $$V = 2\tau\int_{1.5}^{2} \sqrt{x^2 - 4}\ dx$$ Let: $x=2\sin\theta$. Then: $dx = 2\cos\theta\ d\theta$. $$V =2\tau\int_{\arcsin(3/4)}^{\tau / 4} \sqrt{(2\sin\theta)^2 -4} \cdot2\cos\theta\

Let us call $d(n)$ the classical divisor function, i.e. $d(n)=\sum_{d|n}$ is the number of divisors of the integer $n$. It is well known that the sum of $d(n)$ over all positive integers from $n=1$ to $x$, when $x$ tends to infinity, is asymptotic to $$x \ln(x) + (2 \gamma-1) x + O(\sqrt{x})$$ I would like to calculate a similar asymptotic expression for the sum of $d(n)/n$, again calculated from $n=1$ to $x$ and for $x$ that tends to infinity. I have made some calculations and obtained the  formula 
$$1/2 (\ln(x))^2 + 2 \gamma \ln (x) + O(1)$$ 
where gamma is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. I am interested in the constant term of the expression, which seems to be around $0.48$. I suspect that it could correspond to $\gamma^2 - 2\gamma_1$,   where $\gamma_1$ is the first Stieltjes constant ($-0.072...$). Could someone confirm this to me? As an additional question, I would be very interested in obtaining similar asymptotic formulas, with explicitly given constant terms,  for the same sum of $d(n)/n$ calculated over all odd integers from $1$ to $x$, and for that calculated over all even integers from $1$ to $x$.

What I thought could work was 
$$z^2-3z+1= 1^{1/4} $$
Given that the 4 4th-roots of 1 are $1, i, -i, -1$ my idea was to look at each case separately. Starting with $1$ and with $z=a+bi \quad a,b \in R$:
$$z^2-3z+1= 1\\z^2-3z=0\\a^2+2abi-b^2=3a+3bi$$
From where you get
$$2ab=3b\ \to \ a=\frac 32\\a^2-b^2=3a\ \to \ \frac94-b^2=\frac92 \ \to \ b\notin R$$ So no possible solutions in this case.
I think the idea is okay but when I try to do the same with $i$:
$$z^2-3z+1= i\to (a^2-b^2-3a+1)+i(2ab-3b)=i $$
And I get:
$$a^2-b^2-3a+1 = 0\\2ab-3b=1 $$

If we write $X=$Spec $A$ then $A$ is a finite dimensional vector space over $K$. If $A$ was a domain then it is easy to show that it is a field, and so we get that all primes of $A$ are maximal, and hence $X$ consists only of closed points.
