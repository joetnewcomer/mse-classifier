1078209,How does one generate recognizable point-patterns on a plane?,"I've recently learned that some smartpens (e.g. Livescribe) have a camera in their front part. They film the paper. You have to use special paper which looks as if somebody made a lot of tiny holes with a needle in that paper. Those holes are not in a regular pattern. They are spaced in such a way that the pen can decide - taking only an image of the part of the paper near the pen tip - where on the paper it is. I can't get this problem out of my head. It's different from what I have seen so far and I am curious how this can be tackled / solved. Now suppose we have ordinary A4 paper (210 mm × 297 mm), the camera can see an area $10 \text{mm} \times 10 \text{mm}$ the dots on the paper are circles with diameter 0.5 mm a distance measuring (or printing) precision (of dots) of 0.1 mm The filmed area $A$ is defined by its center point $(x,y)$. 
$$A(x,y) = [x-5\text{mm},x+5\text{mm}] \times[y-5\text{mm},y+5\text{mm}]$$
with $x \in [5,205], y  \in[5, 292]$. (How) can the points be spread on the paper so that each $A(x,y)$ is unique? If it is not possible, how could the four values (paper size, camera area, circle diameter, precision) be adjusted so that it would work? Brute-Force solution A brute-force solution would be to add a grid of 0.1 mm spaced lines (because of the precision) on the paper. Then we could generate all possible distributions of points by simply counting up. However, this would require a lot of checking if a given distribution is valid: There are $\frac{205\text{mm}-5\text{mm}}{0.1 \text{mm}} \cdot \frac{292\text{mm}-5\text{mm}}{0.1 \text{mm}} = 5,740,000$ possible centers for the pen tip. We would have to compare each of those, resulting in $\frac{5,740,000^2 + 5,740,000}{2} = 16,473,802,870,000 \approx 16 \cdot 10^{12}$ comparisons.

1078234,Open neighborhoods in ordinals with the order topology,"While learning about ordinals, my teacher made some remarks about any ordinal α being equipped with the order topology, and some facts, one of which was basically that the finite ordinals and ω are discrete topological spaces, and no ordinal beyond that is discrete . This intuitively made sense to me, since any ordinal β greater than ω must contain ω, and ω shouldn't be an isolated point. Any open ball in β centered around ω should contain co-finitely many points of ω, i.e. it should contain, for some large enough $n$, $\{n, n+1, n+2, ...\}$. How do I pick this $n$ to make this rigorous? If, for instance, $β=ω+1$, what my friend and I thought to try was to create a bijection $0 ↦ 1$, $n ↦ 1/n$ (for $n≠0$), and $ω ↦ 0$. Then for any $ε ∈ ℝ_{>0}$, if we just pick $n$ to be $\lceil 1/ε \rceil +1$, we can visibly see that for this $n$, $1/n$ will be $B(0,ε)$. Then after undoing transformation, is it the case that this same $n$ will belong to $B(ω,ε)$ in $ω+1$, and that it will be the largest (or second largest) $n$ for which it and all its successors belong to $B(ω,ε)$? Frankly, while the bijection above helped me to think about this differently, I'd like a more direct way to look at this problem, since I'd also like to think about the generalization of this problem to any limit ordinal (to show that the set of limit points of an ordinal 𝛿 is precisely the set of limit ordinals less than 𝛿).

Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 9 years ago . Improve this question The discovery of the Banach-Tarski paradox was of course a great thing in mathematics but raises the issue of the relation between mathematics and reality. Empirically there are good reasons for faith in mathematical proofs: well derived mathematical theories and formulas, used in an accurate manner in science, really bring observable results. I don't know any scientific failures where mathematical results was blamed. Naturally constructive proofs are preferable but there shouldn't be any problem with non-constructive proofs : the mathematical-logical machinery should guaranty the expected success. With or without the use of the law of the excluded middle! So how to explain the non-intuitive theorem of Banach-Tarski? Which are the ""weak pillars"" or combinations of them? Personally I can't see the axiom of choice as a problem, since it only is a condition of what's to be called a set. Is the theorem perhaps a sign of lack of continuity in reality? I really would like a big list of suggestions what ""axioms"" could be
  changed to avoid the ""possibility"" of the the theorem. I have been re-considering. Suppose that a new discrete theory about space and time was developed and was found to be consistent with observations. How long would it take before a corresponding theory was developed from a pure geometrical perspective? Compare with the corresponding theories of Heisenberg and Schrödinger! What was explained in one way in the discrete theory maybe was described in a totally differnt way in the continuous theory? And who knows, maybe similar constructions as in the paradoxes of Banach-Tarski and Sierpinski-Mazurkiewicz, would be used to explain the expansion of what is now called dark energy? And even ""worse"", to explain the result of high energy proton- proton collisions? It strikes me that the relative terms of consistency as is used in mathematics is all what is needed for the mathematical material to be used in scientific theories. Physicists do sometimes use mathematics in extraordinary ways and get good results. But that does not make it less interesting to ponder the pillars of the ""paradoxes"".

I'm using the signature $(+,+,-)$, that is, $$G = \begin{pmatrix} 1& 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0  & -1\end{pmatrix}.$$ I know for a fact that this result is true, I've seen it in a more general form in his other book, ""The Geometry of Kerr Black Holes"". The proof there is overkill for what I'm doing here. Since these sign conventions are such a pain, I'll put the definitions I'm working with here, along with two useful results that I've proved: Definition: Given a frame field $\{{\bf E}_i\}_{i = 1}^3$, the $1$-forms defined by $$\omega_{ij}({\bf V}) = \epsilon_j \langle
 \nabla_{\bf V}{\bf E}_i, {\bf E}_j \rangle$$ are called the connection
   forms of the given frame field. Also, $\omega_{ij} = -\epsilon_i
 \epsilon_j \omega_{ji}$, where $\epsilon_i = \langle {\bf E}_i,{\bf
 E}_i\rangle$. Definition: Given a matrix $A = (a_{ij})_{1 \leq i,j \leq 3}$, where the $a_{ij}$ are functions, we define ${\rm d}A = ({\rm
 d}a_{ij})_{1 \leq i,j \leq 3}$ and $A_\epsilon = (\epsilon_i
 a_{ij})_{1 \leq i,j \leq 3}$. Theorem: Let $\{{\bf E}_i\}_{i = 1}^3$ be a frame field, and $A = (a_{ij})_{1 \leq i,j\leq 3}$ be its attitude matrix, that is, ${\bf E}_i = \sum_j a_{ij} \partial_j$. If $\omega = (\omega_{ij})_{1 \leq i,j \leq 3}$, then $$\omega = {\rm d}A \cdot GA_\epsilon^{ \ t},$$ where the product in
   the right side is to be seen as the wedge product. Note: $A_\epsilon^{
 \ t} \neq A_{\ \epsilon}^t$. Lemma: With notation as above: $$A \cdot GA_{\epsilon}^{\ t} = {\rm Id_3}.$$ With this I can go on. I have: $$\begin{align}\omega &=  {\rm d}A \cdot GA_\epsilon^{ \ t} \\ &\implies {\rm d}\omega = {\rm d}( {\rm d}A \cdot GA_\epsilon^{ \ t}) \\ &\implies {\rm d}\omega = -  {\rm d}A\cdot {\rm d}(GA_\epsilon^{\ t})  \\ &\implies {\rm d}\omega = - {\rm d}A \cdot G ({\rm d}A)_\epsilon^{\ t} \\ &\implies{\rm d}\omega = -{\rm d}A \cdot GA_{\epsilon}^{\ t} \cdot A \cdot G^t({\rm d}A)_\epsilon^{\ t} \\ &\implies {\rm d}\omega = -\omega \cdot ({\rm d}A)_\epsilon G A^t\end{align}.$$ Since I don't know how to go from here, I'll open both sides.

1078303,What happens to geodesic curvature under the Gauss map?,"$\def\RR{\mathbb{R}}$Let $D$ be a closed disc, smoothly embedded in $\RR^3$. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem tells me that $\int \!\! \int_D K + \int_{\partial D} \kappa = 2 \pi$, where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature, and $\kappa$ is the geodesic curvature. Let $g: D \to S^2$ be the Gauss map. Then $K = g^{\ast} \mathrm{Area}$, where $\mathrm{Area}$ is the standard area $2$-form on $S^2$. For simplicity, I'll assume that the Gauss map is injective on $D$. So $\int \!\! \int_D K = \int \! \! \int_{g(D)} \mathrm{Area}$. Now, applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to $g(D)$, we get $\int \! \! \int_{g(D)} \mathrm{Area} + \int_{g(\partial D)} \kappa = 2 \pi$. So $\int_{\partial D} \kappa = \int_{g(\partial D)} \kappa$, where the two $\kappa$'s denote the respective Gaussian curvatures. For notational clarity, let $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ be the corresponding $1$-forms on $\partial D$ and $g(\partial D)$. The simplest explanation would be if $\kappa_1 = g^{\ast} \kappa_2$. But I think this is false! In particular, this would suggest that if a portion of $\partial D$ were geodesic, so would be the same portion of $g(\partial D)$, and that would show that the Gauss map took geodesics to geodesics, which is not true . My best guess is that there is some closed $1$-form $\eta$ on the tangent bundle $TS$ so that $\kappa_1 - g^{\ast} \kappa_2 = \eta|_{\partial D}$, where we have lifted $\partial D$ from $S$ to $TS$ by taking the velocity of a parametrization. The lifting of $\partial D$ to $TS$ is contractible in $TS$ (first shrink down to $S$ by dilating the tangent spaces, and then use that $\partial D$ is the boundary of $D$), so the integral of closed $1$-form on $\partial D$ is $0$. Is my guess right? Where do I read about this?

1078925,Checking if a relation is complete,"I have a transitive relation $\subset$ on a (finite and small) set S and a list of pairs $x_i\subset y_i.$ I would like to check if my list is complete in the sense that if $x\subset y$ then there are appropriate indices $i,j,\ldots,k$ such that
$$x=x_i\subset y_i=x_j\subset y_j=\cdots=x_k\subset y_k=y.$$ To do this I will need to prove assertions of the form $x\not\subset y$ for many pairs $(x,y).$ Since this is hard (each one is a proof!) I'd like to do the least number possible. I'm looking for an algorithm to give such a minimal list (which should be unique). My initial idea: With a new element $\top$, add $s\subset\top$ to the list for all $s\in S$. Take the transitive reduction of the list (if $a\subset b$ and $b\subset c$ are on the list, remove $a\subset c$ from the list). For each element $y\in S\cup\{\top\}$ find all $x_i$ such that $x_i\subset y$ is on the list. For each pair $i\ne j$ check that $x_i\not\subset x_j$. The question: Does my algorithm work? That is, does it generate the (1) enough pairs to check such that, if all noninclusions are verified, the (original) list is complete, and (2) no smaller set of pairs could be checked to reach the first conclusion?

The symmetry between the three series is not perfect and using the fact that $\displaystyle\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \left( {\frac {1}{(n+1)^{s}}} - \frac{1}{n^s}\right)=-1$, it can be rewritten into a series that (imo) has a bit more ""beauty"": $$\displaystyle \zeta(s) = \frac{1}{2\,(s-1)} \left(1+\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \left( {\frac {n+1}{(n+1)^{s}}} + \frac{2\,(s-1)}{n^s}-{\frac {n-1}{\left( n-1 \right) ^{s}}}\right) \right), \qquad -1<\Re(s)<1$$ which becomes: $$\displaystyle \zeta(s) = \frac{1}{2\,(s-1)} + \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \left( {\frac {(n+1)^{1-s}-(n-1)^{1-s}}{2\,(s-1)}} + \frac{1}{n^s}\right), \qquad -1<\Re(s)<1$$ $$\displaystyle \zeta\left(\frac12\right) = \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \left(\sqrt{n-1} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} -{ \sqrt{n+1}}\right)-1\qquad(2)$$ Are (1) and (2) known series for $\zeta\left(\frac12\right)$?

Prove that $A$ is an infinite simple group.

This is in light of the appearance of countable chains in the preceding exercise: Prove that if there exists a chain of subgroups $G_1 \leq G_2 \leq \dots \leq G$ such that $G=\cup_{i=1}^\infty G_i$ and each $G_i$ is simple then $G$ is simple. Assuming that $\Omega=\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,\dots\}$ is countably infinite, I have an attempt at the proof: For $n \geq 5$ let $A_n$ be the subgroup of ""even"" permutations as defined in the exercise, which move only points of the set $\{1,2,\dots, n\}$.

Make sure to show $F'(t)$ is finite. This came from an old qualifying exam at my university. Here is my attempt (letting $h(x,t)$ stand for the function in the integral): Since $p-1>0$ and since $f$ and $g$ are positive, the partial $$\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}=pg(x)[f(x)+tg(x)]^{p-1}$$ exists for each $(x,t), x\in E, t\in [0,\infty)$.

1079309,Explaining the difference between the number theoretic Langlands program and geometric Langlands program to a graduate student.,"I am a graduate student who just took a course introducing some notions in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry (officially, it was a course on an introduction to the Langlands program). Almost every lecture, the professor spoke about some geometric analog of some field-theoretic object / algebraic object. Can anyone provide a general description of the relationship between the classical Langlands program and the geometric Langlands program? If the difference is very technical and out of the reach of a novice, could you direct me to a resource? Thanks.","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'number-theory']"

1079335,Transformation of contour integral $\int \frac{z^2}{e^{2\pi i z^3}-1} \operatorname dz$ over the circle $|z|=\sqrt[3]{n+\frac{1}{2}}$,"I would like to solve the following: $$\int\limits_{|z|=\sqrt[3]{n+\frac{1}{2}}} \frac{z^2}{e^{2\pi i z^3}-1}\operatorname dz$$ I'm given an hint: ""use a transformation $w=z^3$"" I would make use of the following theorem: If $w$ holomorphic on $\Gamma$ and $f$ continous on $w(\Gamma)$ then 
  $$\int\limits_{w(\Gamma)} f(w) \operatorname dw = \int\limits_\Gamma f(w(z)) w'(z) \operatorname dz$$ But I'm a bit confused as to the contour itself. Is the following right? ($\Gamma_1$ is the circle with radius $\sqrt[3]{n+\frac{1}{2}}$ and center $O$, while $\Gamma_2$ had a radius of $n+\frac{1}{2}$) $$\begin{align}
\int_{\Gamma_1} \frac{z^2}{e^{2\pi i z^3}-1}\operatorname dz &= \int_{\Gamma_2} \frac{w^{\frac{2}{3}}}{e^{2\pi i w}-1} \cdot \frac{1}{3}\cdot w^{-\frac{2}{3}}\operatorname dw\\
&=  \frac{1}{3} \int_{\Gamma_2} \frac{\operatorname dw}{e^{2\pi i w}-1}\\
\end{align}$$ Using the residue theorem ($\operatorname*{res}_{w=k} f(w) = \frac{-i}{2\pi}$) $$\int_{\Gamma_1} \frac{z^2}{e^{2\pi i z^3}-1}\operatorname dz = 1$$ Question This looks to good to be true ;) Could someone verify?

1079356,Closed immersions are stable under base change,"My question can be summarized as: I want to prove that closed immersions are stable under base change. This is exercise II.3.11.a in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry. I researched this for about half a day. I consulted a number of books and online notes, but I found the proofs to be vague. Vakil's notes (9.2.1) hint that this is an immediate consequence of the canonical isomorphism $ M/IM\cong M\otimes_{A}A/I $, and so does Liu's book (1.23). The proof can't be this simple. I need to show that this can be reduced to the affine case, and to do so, I need to show that a closed immersion into an affine scheme is affine. I haven't been able to do so yet. Edit: I found a proof for this later but I still don't know how to use it to prove the question above. As for the Stacks project, I had to traverse a tree propositions, until I eventually found a proof that uses concepts like quasi-coherent sheaves, something not introduced in Hartshorne's book at this point. I also consulted Gortz & Wedhorn. The book cites section 4.11 as a proof for this. However the section is a general introduction to the categorical fibred product. It's unrelated. In fact the official errata mentions this error and cites proposition 4.20 instead. It is unclear to me how the proposition shows the result. I suspect the book uses a different - but equivalent - definition. At this point, I'm frustrated. I'm self-studying and don't have anybody to ask. Could somebody please be kind enough to show me a self-contained proof?",['algebraic-geometry']

1079414,Local Artinian rings with a principal maximal ideal,"I would be very grateful if someone would check my proof of the following result (this is not homework). All rings are commutative and unital. Proposition: If $(A,\mathfrak{m})$ is a local Artinian ring and $\mathfrak{m}$ is principal, then every non-zero ideal of $A$ is a power of $\mathfrak{m}$. Proof: I assume the following two facts: Artinian rings are Noetherian. The Jacobson radical of an Artinian ring is nilpotent. By facts 1 and 2 combined, we see that $\mathfrak{m}$ is nilpotent. Hence, given a proper, non-zero ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of $A$, there is some $r \geq 1$ such that $\mathfrak{a}\subseteq\mathfrak{m}^r$ (we have $\mathfrak{a}\subseteq \mathfrak{m}$ as $A$ is local) but $\mathfrak{a}\nsubseteq\mathfrak{m}^{r+1}.$ We will show that $\mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{m}^r.$ Choose $y \in \mathfrak{a}$ such that $y \notin \mathfrak{m}^{r+1}.$ As $\mathfrak{m}$ is principal, we have $y=ax^r$ for some $a \in A$ and $x \in A$ such that $\mathfrak{m}=(x)$. But as $\mathfrak{a}\nsubseteq(x^{r+1})$ we have $a \notin (x)$ and so, as $A$ is local, we have that $a$ is a unit in $A$. Therefore $x^r=a^{-1}y \in \mathfrak{a}$ and so $\mathfrak{m}^r\subseteq\mathfrak{a}$. Q.E.D. Many thanks!","['commutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra']"
1079423,Eigenvalues of symmetric matrix with skew-symmetric matrix perturbation,"If $A$ is diagonalizable, using the Bauer-Fike theorem , for any eigenvalue $λ$ of $A$ , there exists an eigenvalue $μ$ of $A+E$ such that $|\lambda-\mu|\leq\|E\|_2$ (the vector induced norm). Here I have the doubt that if we have more properties on $A$ and $E$ : $A$ is symmetric and $E$ is skew-symmetric, The eigenvalues of $A$ are completely separated from each other, i.e.: there is a certain distance between each two eigenvalues so that with sufficiently small $\|E\|_2$ , the perturbed eigenvalues are still different from each other. Do we have $|\lambda-\mu|\leq c\|E\|_2^2$ for some constant $c$ ? Is there any strict proof or a counterexample? I have only a rough idea that it may be true, because if we denote $\lambda(\epsilon)$ as the eigenvalue of $A+\epsilon E$ , then: $$ \lambda(-\epsilon)=\lambda(A-\epsilon E)=\lambda(A^T-\epsilon E^T)=\lambda(A+\epsilon E)=\lambda(\epsilon) $$ This means the function $\lambda(\epsilon)$ is an even function, so the Taylor expansion may be $$ \lambda(\epsilon)=\lambda(0)+\lambda''(0)\epsilon^2/2+O(\epsilon^4) $$ Or equivalently, $$ \lambda(A+\epsilon E)-\lambda(A)=\lambda''(0)\epsilon^2/2+O(\epsilon^4) $$","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'perturbation-theory']"
1079451,Weird isomorphisms of infinite groups,"According to my interpretation to one of the answers in Splitting in Short exact sequence , $$\Bbb R \cong \Bbb Q \oplus \Bbb R / \Bbb Q$$ also, according to What is known about the quotient group $\mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Q}$? $$\Bbb R \cong \Bbb R / \Bbb Q$$ as groups. This seems very strange to me as if the direct sum with $\Bbb Q$ adds nothing to the group structure at all in any way even ""attacted"" on the side separately.

1079463,Prove $f$ entire and with a pole at infinity to be polynomial,"The question has been asked before, but I can't seem to wrap my head around it. I guess I'm missing something. There is a certain part where I'm experiencing problems, and I can't seem to find an answer to that specific part in the other question(s). If $f$ is entire and $\lim_{z\to \infty} f(z)= \infty$ then $f$ is  polynomial. Proof: Since $f$ is entire it can be expanded as a Taylor-series. $$f(z) =\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} a_n z^n$$ To prove $f$ would be polynomial I would have to prove $(\exists N)(\forall n > N)(a_n = 0)$ Define: $$g(z) = f\left( \frac{1}{z}\right) = \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} a_n\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)^n$$ Since $0$ is a pole ( see below ) of $g(z)$ the expansion above would be it's corresponding Laurent-expansion. And by definition of a pole $(\exists N)(\forall n >N)(a_n = 0)$ . Q.E.D. However Why is $0$ a pole of $g(z)$ , why does $\lim_{z \to \infty} f(z) = \infty$ imply $0$ to be a pole of $g(z)$ ? I know $\lim_{z \to \infty} f(z) = \infty$ implies $\infty$ to be a pole of $f(z)$ , but then...?","['laurent-series', 'complex-analysis']"
