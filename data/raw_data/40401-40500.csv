397003,Integrate: $\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x^2 - x^3}}dx$,"How to integrate using Residue theorem.
$$\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x^2 - x^3}}dx$$ How do I choose my branch-cut particularly? I was reading this article on wikiepdia and I think it is related. What I don't understand is ""The cut of $z^{3/4}$ is therefore $(−∞, 0]$ and the cut of $(3−z)^{1/4}$ is $(−∞, 3]$. It is easy to see that the cut of the product of the two, i.e. $f(z)$, is $[0, 3]$"" . What is this product? Is it $(-\infty, 3]\setminus (-\infty, 0] \cup {0}$ ? Why is $0\le\arg((3-z)^{(1/4)}) \le 2\pi$? the start of angle is taken at negative $x$ axis (counterclockwise) while $0\le\arg(z^{(3/4)}) \le 2\pi$ is taken along positive axis (counterclockwise)? Also in my integral, I think I don't have residue outside the contour, do I? Thanks for your help in advance!!

397004,Area of a Random Polygon,"The following is a long description of a computation I'd like to make.  You can think of the process described as a spider randomly building a web.  I'd like to know how big we can expect the web to be. Inscribe inside a circle of radius $1$ a regular polygon with $n$-vertices, labeled consecutively.  Draw a radius from the center to each vertex.  For $i=1,\ldots,n$, place a bead $b_i$ on the radius connected to vertex $i$.  We can slide each bead to different positions on its radius, so the state of the beads is described with a vector $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in [0,1]^n$, where $x_i$ is the distance of $b_i$ from the center.  Let $P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ be the polygon formed by connecting each $b_i$ to its immediate neighbors with a straight line segment.  Each pair of neighbors along with the center form a triangle, and summing the area of all such triangles gives the area of $P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$: $$A(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\frac{1}{2}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)\left(x_nx_1+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}x_ix_{i+1}\right)$$ The total area of the regular $n$-gon is $$A_n=\frac{n}{2}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)$$ The ratio of the two areas defines a function: $$f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\frac{1}{n}\left(x_nx_1+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}x_ix_{i+1}\right)$$ If we choose the $x_i$ uniformly at random, what is the probability that $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)>c$ for a given $c\in[0,1]$? Since $f$ is continuous, the set $E_c=\{(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\mid f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)>c\}\subset [0,1]^n$ is measurable, so I'm just looking for $m(E_c)$, but I'm not too sure how to find it.","['probability-theory', 'polygons', 'measure-theory']"
397028,Compute value of $\pi$ up to 8 digits,"I am quite lost on how approximate the value of $\pi$ up to 8 digits with a confidence of 99% using Monte Carlo. I think this requires a large number of trials but how can I know how many trials? I know that a 99% confidence interval is 3 standard deviations away from the mean in a normal distribution. From the central limit theorem the standard deviation of the sample mean (or standard error) is proportional to the standard deviation of the population $\sigma_{\bar X} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ So I have something that relates the size of the sample (i.e. number of trials) with the standard deviation, but then I don't know how to proceed from here. How does the ""8 digit precision"" comes into play? UPDATE Ok I think I am close to understand it. From CLT we have $\displaystyle \sigma_{M} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$ so in this case $\sigma = \sqrt{p(1-p)}$ therfore $\displaystyle \sigma_{M} = \frac{\sqrt{p(1-p)}}{\sqrt{N}}$ Then from the Bernoulli distribution, $\displaystyle \mu = p = \frac{\pi}{4}$ therefore $$\sigma_{M}=\frac{\sqrt{\pi(4-\pi)}}{\sqrt{N}}$$ but what would be the value of $\sigma_{M}$? and then I have $\pi$ in the formula but is the thing I am trying to approximate so how does this work? and still missing the role of the 8 digit precision.","['probability-limit-theorems', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

Let $B$ be a topological space and $G$ a topological group acting on a space $F$. Then the space $G^B$ of continuous maps from $B$ to $G$ has a group structure given by pointwise multiplication. Moreover, for nice enough spaces the compact-open topology gives $G^B$ the structure of a topological group. This group acts on the space $F^B$ (again endowed with the compact open-topology) in the obvious pointwise way and the action is continuous. My question is the following: assume $G$ acts transitively; can we infer the same holds for $G^B$? If not, under what assumptions is transitivity preserved? Notice that freeness and faithfulness are (separately) preserved (it is enough to think pointwise).","['general-topology', 'functional-analysis', 'group-theory', 'group-actions']"

397361,Group extension of $\mathbb Z_4$ by $\mathbb Z_2$,"Let $f : G →\mathbb Z_2$ be an extension of $\mathbb Z_4$ by $\mathbb Z_2$ . Suppose that the induced action $α_f :\mathbb Z_2 →\mathbb Z^{\times}_4$ carries the generator of $\mathbb Z_2$ to $−1$ . Then $G$ is isomorphic to either $D_8$ or $Q_8$ . Proof Let $\mathbb Z_4 = \langle b \rangle$ and $\mathbb Z_2 = \langle a \rangle$ . For any $x ∈ G$ with $f(x) = a$ , we have $xb^kx^{−1} = α_f (a)(b^k) = b^{−k}$ for all $k$ . Also, $f(x^2) = a^2 = e$ , so $x^2$ ∈ ker f = b. Thus, $x^2$ = $b^k$ for some k. Note that x fails to commute with b and $b^{−1}$ , so neither of these can equal $x^2$ . Thus, either $x^2$ = e or $x^2$ = $b^2$ . If $x^2$ = e, then x has order 2, and hence there is a section of f, specified by s(a)= x. In this case, $G \cong\mathbb  Z_4 \rtimes_{α_f}\mathbb  Z_2$ , which, for this value of $α_f$ , is isomorphic to the dihedral group $D_8$ . I'm a bit confused about how they got from $x^2=e$ to $G \cong Z_4 \rtimes_{\alpha_f} Z_2$ . If s(a) = x, then the section $s: Z_2 \rightarrow G$ sends 1 to e and -1 to x, right? So we must have an element of order 2 in G. Additionally, we know that we have a normal subgroup of order 4. However, if we want to construct a semidirect product, we need to make sure that $Z_2$ and $Z_4$ do not have any elements in common, except for the identity, right? But what if $x=b^2$ ? The remaining case gives $x^2 = b^2$ . But then there is a homomorphism $h : Q_8 → G$ with $h(a) = x$ and $h(b) = b$ . In my notes, it says that any group G is isomorphic to $Q_{2n}$ if the following conditions hold: $\bullet$ $x^4=e$ $\bullet$ $b^{2n}=e$ $\bullet$ $x^{-1}bx=b^{-1}$ $\bullet$ $x^2 = b^n$ Of course, in this case, all of the first three conditions hold. But what about the 4th one? We know that $x^2 = b^2 \not= b^4$ . Then how does that homomorphism exist? As the image of h contains more than half the elements of G, h must be onto, and hence an isomorphism. (Alternatively, we could use the Five Lemma for Extensions to show that h is an isomorphism.) I'm not sure if I understand this. The only thing we know about G is that it contains a normal subgroup of order 4, right? So what if we map the group of order 4 in $Q_8$ to the group of order 4 in G? Then we won't ahve mroe than half the elements of G in the image, right? Also, for the Five Lemma for Extensions... in order to use that theorem, we need an extension for $Q_8$ , right? But we're not given any. In other words, we have $\langle b \rangle \rightarrow G \rightarrow \mathbb Z_2$ . But For $Q_8$ , we have $\langle b' \rangle \rightarrow Q_8 \rightarrow ?$ . $Q_8$ , of course, is not a split extension of b by $Z_2$ , for two reasons. First, we know that every element of $Q_8$ which is not in b has order 4, and hence it is impossible to define a section from $Q_8/\langle b \rangle$ to Q8. Second, if it were a split extension, then it would be isomorphic to $D_8$ , which we know is not so. Why is it impossible to define a section? Is it not possible to say $s(a)=b^2$ . I guess this is related to my previous question. We have classified the extensions of Z4 by Z2 corresponding to the homomorphism
from $Z_2$ to $Z^{\times}_4$ that takes the generator of $Z_2$ to −1. Since $Z^{\times}_4$ is isomorphic to $Z_2$ , there is only one other homomorphism from $Z_2$ to $Z^{\times}_4$ : the trivial homomorphism. So if we look at all the possibilities of where the generator is being sent, then that would be like classifying all groups of order 8, right?

Morevoer I would like to take it as an opportunity to find out how to write proof with equalities, because I tend in those cases to write them in a cumbersome way, with necessary and sufficient conditions. [I assume that this is partly due to the influence of ""How to prove it: a structured approach"", a book that I loved, but that left me the tendency to be quite mechanical in proving any sort of result]. Theorem: Let $X$ and $Y$ be nonempty sets and $f \in Y^X$. Prove that, for any (nonempty) classes $\mathcal{A} \subseteq 2^X$, we have 
$ f(\cup \mathcal{A}) = \cup \{f(A):A \in \mathcal{A} \} $ Here, it's how I approach the problem. Tentative Proof: First of all, by definition of (direct) image of a function, we have 
$$f(\cup \mathcal{A}) := \{f(x):x\in \cup \mathcal{A} \}. \hspace{1cm} (*)$$
Let $X$, $Y$ be arbitrary (nonempty) sets. Let $f$ be an arbitrary function that maps from $X$ to $Y$ and let $\mathcal{A}$ be a family of sets, subset of the powerset of $X$. By $(*)$, the result we have to prove becomes
$$ \{f(x):x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \} = \cup \{ f(A):A \in \mathcal{A}\} \hspace{1cm} (1)$$
In order to prove it, rephrase $(1)$ as
$$ \forall y ( y \in \{f(x):x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \} \leftrightarrow y \in \cup \{ f(A):A \in \mathcal{A}\}). \hspace{1cm} (2)$$
We start by proving the necessary condition. Let $y$ be an arbitrary element and assume that $y$ is a member of $\{f(x):x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \}$. This means that $\exists x(x \in \cup \mathcal{A} \land y=x)$. At the same time, we have to prove that $\exists A(A \in \mathcal{A} \land y\in f(A))$. And here I got stuck... I really don't see how from my premises I can get the desired result. Indeed, what $A$ should be?

The second piece is that (Lebesgue) integration on a measure zero set would be equal to zero.

Hence $\lim_{n \to \infty}f(y_n) \neq \lim_{n \to \infty}f(z_n)$ and $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{\sin (x)}$ does not exist. If the working above is correct, I then would like to show that since $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{\sin (x)}$, then $\lim_{x \to 0} \exp \left(\frac{1}{\sin (x)}\right)$ does not exist, if $\lim_{x \to 0} \exp \left(\frac{1}{\sin (x)}\right)$ does not exist, then $\lim_{x \to 0} \exp(\sin (x)) + \lim_{x \to 0} \exp \left(\frac{1}{\sin (x)}\right)$ does not exist.

397740,Discrete subgroups of SU(n) and SO(n).,"Thank you very much for your concern. I am in physics background, any simpler but complete explanation would be helpful. I would like to know whether there is a complete understanding of discrete subgroup of SU(n) and SO(n). If SU(n) and SO(n) are too general, in particular, we can focus on: (1) all discrete subgroups of SU(2), (2) all discrete subgroups of SU(3), (3) all discrete subgroups of SO(3), (4) all discrete subgroups of SO(4). I have heard the fact of discrete subgroups of SU(2) is addressed by ADE classification. I also learned from a note about discrete subgroups of SO(3) by Ginzparg's note .
But I cannot list down all of the subgroups of SU(2) and SO(3), for example: (5) whether $(\mathbb Z_2)^3$ or $\mathbb Z_n \times \mathbb Z_m \times \mathbb Z_o$ (with some arbitrary $n,m,o$) are subgroups of SU(2), SU(3), SO(3), SO(4)?

PS. Accidentally I found this paper by Hanany and He , where its Appendix I and III offer table for discrete subgroups of SU(2) and SU(3); however, further illumination on discrete subgroup of SU(n) and SO(n) and my (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) would still be helpful.

The proof follows exactly same lines as it is in representation theory. I would like to ask the following question, which is a converse of Schur's lemma in some sense. Question 1: If $G$ is a finite group, $|G|>2$, such that every non-identity homomorphism $\phi\colon G\rightarrow G$ is an automorphism, should $G$ necessarily simple? The progress towards the solution I made is the following: if $G$ satisfies the hypothesis in the question and $G$ is non-abelian, then $G$ is not solvable: if $G$ is non-abelian, solvable, then it has non-identity abelian quotient $G^{ab}=G/[G,G]$. Let $p$ be a prime divisor of $|G^{ab}|$ (hence $p$ also divides $|G|$). Then there is a surjective homomorphism from $G^{ab}$ to $C_p$ (cyclic group of order $p$). We can embedd $C_p$ in $G$. Then, consider the composition of the homomorphisms: $G\rightarrow G^{ab} \rightarrow C_p\rightarrow G$. It is a non-identity homomorphism from $G$ to $G$ which is clearly not an automorphism. Note that if $G$ is abelian, which is not cyclic of prime order, then we can easily find non-identity homomorphisms $G\rightarrow G$ which are not automorphisms. I would like to ask a general question also (remove the condition of finiteness in above question).

397805,Proving convergence of a Hilbert modular theta function $\vartheta(z):= \sum\limits_{x \in \mathcal{O}_F} e^{\pi i \operatorname{Tr}(x^2 z)}$,"I'm trying to understand a somewhat sketchy proof that I found online of the convergence of the analog of Jacobi's theta function $\displaystyle{\theta(\tau) := \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} e^{2 \pi i n^2 \tau } = 1 + 2 \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}e^{2 \pi i n^2 \tau } }$ in the context of Hilbert modular forms for real quadratic fields. It is well known that this  function is holomorphic on the upper half plane $\mathbb{H}$, and I made sure to understand well and wrote down a detailed proof of this before asking this question. The context of my question is as follows Let $F = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ be a real quadratic field, with $d > 0$ a positive square-free integer such that $d \equiv 2, 3 \pmod{4}$. Assume also that $F$ has class number $1$. Also its ring of integers is $\mathcal{O}_F = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}] = \mathbb{Z} \oplus\sqrt{d} \, \mathbb{Z} = \{ n + m\sqrt{d} \mid n, m \in \mathbb{Z} \}$. Then there are two real embeddings $\sigma_i : F \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ given by  $\sigma_1(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a + b\sqrt{d}$ and $\sigma_2(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a - b\sqrt{d}$, so that $\sigma_1$ is just the identity map, and $\sigma_2$ gives the ""conjugate"" of an element. Now for $z = (z_1, z_2) \in \mathbb{H} \times \mathbb{H}$ and $\alpha \in F$, we define the ""trace"" as follows $\operatorname{Tr}(\alpha z) := \sigma_1(\alpha) z_1 + \sigma_2(\alpha) z_2 = \alpha z_1 + \alpha' z_2$, where we wrote $\alpha'$ for the conjugate of $\alpha$. Finally we define the holomorphic Hilbert modular theta function $\vartheta: \mathbb{H} \times \mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by $$
\vartheta(z) := \vartheta(z_1, z_2) := \sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}_F} e^{\pi i \operatorname{Tr}(x^2 z)}
$$ I'm trying to prove the absolute convergence of this infinite series. The argument I found online To prove the convergence of the series, it is compared to the Jacobi theta function defined above. To be precise, the author observes that $$
|\vartheta(z)| = \left| \sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}_F} e^{\pi i \operatorname{Tr}(x^2 z)} \right| = \left| \sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}_F} e^{\pi i x^2 z_1} e^{\pi i x'^2 z_2} \right| \leq \left| \sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}_F} e^{2 \pi i x^2 z_1} \right|^{1/2}  \left| \sum_{x \in \mathcal{O}_F} e^{2 \pi i x'^2 z_2} \right|^{1/2}
$$ where apparently the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality has been used in the last step, although I'm not convinced that it is true as stated. In any case, then it is noted that since the Jacobi theta function defined above $\displaystyle{\theta(\tau) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} e^{2 \pi i n^2 \tau }}$ is holomorphic on $\mathbb{H}$, then each of the two series on the right hand side of the above inequality are absolutely convergent on compact sets in $\mathbb{H}$, so that the original series $\vartheta(z_1, z_2)$ converges absolutely on compact subests of $\mathbb{H} \times \mathbb{H}$. Questions Can someone please help me understand how does the convergence of each of the series on the right hand side of the above inequality follows from the corresponding fact for the Jacobi theta function? I mean, since each of the two sums on the RHS of the inequality are over all algebraic integers $x \in \mathcal{O}_F = \mathbb{Z} \oplus \sqrt{d} \, \mathbb{Z}$, then the sums are actually double sums, so it doesn't seem to follow trivially. Is the argument where the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is used correct? If I'm not mistaken, I think that the absolute value should be inside the infinite series, like this
$$
\left | \sum x_n y_n  \right| \leq \left( \sum |x_n|^2 \right ) ^{1/2} \left( \sum |y_n|^2 \right ) ^{1/2}

397817,What do linearly ordered abelian groups look like?,"Recently a post on MathOverflow connected a theorem about ordered abelian groups to the axiom of choice, and it made me want to try and play with these objects a bit. But it appears to me that I don't know enough about linearly ordered abelian groups. In particular I am interested in the structure of their Archimedean classes. Let's establish some ad-hoc terminology first. Let $(G,+,\leq)$ be a linearly ordered abelian group. $g\in G$ is positive if $g>0$. The absolute value of $g$ is $|g|=\max\{g,-g\}$. If $g,h\in G$ then $g\sim h$ if and only if $|h|\leq|g|$ and for some natural number $n$, $|g|\leq n|h|$; or $|g|\leq|h|$ and for some natural number $n$, $|h|\leq n|g|$. An Archimedean class of $G$ is an equivalence class of $\sim$. $\Gamma(G)$ is the set of equivalence classes, and $\preceq$ is the natural ordered induced from $\leq$. If $[g],[h]\in\Gamma(G)$ then $[g]\preceq[h]$ if and only if $|g|\leq|h|$ or $g\sim h$. If $g\in G$ then the positive part of the Archimedean class of $g$ is the set $\{h\in G\mid h\sim g\land h>0\}$. If $G$ is an ordered group, an Archimedean extension is a group $K$ such that $G\leq K$, and $\Gamma(G)=\Gamma(K)$. If $G$ has no [nontrivial] Archimedean extensions we say that $G$ is Archimedean complete . In "" Ordered Abelian Groups "", Gravett points out that given an ordered group $G$, we can replace it with a ""rational group"" $G^*$ such that every $x\in G^*$ has some $n$ such that $nx\in G$ (I believe this is ""divisible group"" in modern terms, and $G^*$ is the injective hull of $G$). It is quite clear that this rational group is a vector space over $\Bbb Q$, and that it is an Archimedean extension of $G$. So we can assume that an ordered group is a linearly ordered vector space over the rationals. My questions are: What do Archimedean classes of an ordered group look like? Are they isomorphic to subgroups of $\Bbb R$ (or the positive parts, to subgroups of $\Bbb R^+$)? If not, what sort of counterexamples can we find? Gravett proves the Hahn completeness theorem which states that a group $G$ is Archimedean complete if and only if it is isomorphic to its Hahn group (which is $\Bbb R^{\Gamma(G)}$ where the exponentiation is similar to ordinal exponentiation). Can we conclude in that case that $G$ is actually an ordered vector space over $\Bbb R$? Can we prove that $G$ is Archimedean complete if and only if it is a vector space over $\Bbb R$? Does this mean that $G$ is Archimedean complete if and only if each Archimedean class is isomorphic to $\Bbb R$ (or the positive part to the positive reals), or is this a separate fact that we can prove?","['group-theory', 'order-theory']"
397818,Can an algebraic structure have indistinguishable elements?,"Sometimes, a topological space has indistinguishable points - we call those spaces non- $T_0$ . But given such a space, we can always identify indistinguishable points, thereby yielding a $T_0$ space. (Technically, we've taken the Kolomogorov quotient ). Does this sort of thing ever happen in abstract algebra? Here's two more examples. A preordered set can have comparable, distinct points - in other words it can fail to be antisymmetric. But that's cool, we can identify comparable points to obtain a partially ordered set. Sometimes a pseudometric space has distinct points that are zero distance apart. But that's okay, we can identify zero-distance points to obtain a metric space. Edit: It would be nice to see a definition of 'indistinguishable' for the elements of arbitrary structures. It would then be a consequence of this more general definition that for an arbitrary preordered set $X$ (order relation $\leq$ ) it holds that $x,y \in X$ are indistinguishable iff $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$ . Here's an example. Consider the function $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ , with $f(n)=0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . The associated notion of indistinguishability for the structure $(\mathbb{N},f)$ should probably be the relation $\sim$ such that $a \sim b$ iff both $a$ and $b$ equal $0$ , or both $a$ and $b$ are distinct from $0$ . Edit2: On the other hand, perhaps it does not make sense to speak of 'the natural notion of indistinguishability in a structure $X$ ' without first situating that structure in a category. After all, if we're going to quotient out by the indistinguishability relation, epimorphisms will probably show up at some point.",['abstract-algebra']

my question is that, (1) $x_1$ and $x_2$ are two different variable i just want to calculate the derivative with respect to $x$. (2) if $x_1=x_2$ what would be the value of derivative. Thanks in advance","['multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives']"

398040,A question regarding the Power set,"In the proofs that I have seen so far for showing that the power set $2^X$ of a set $X$ cannot be in bijection to $X$, the common idea is to assume that there exists a surjection $f \colon X \to 2^X$ and then consider the set
$$
B = \{ x \in X \mid x \notin f(x)\}
$$ Then the argument proceeds by saying that this set is contradictory, because its pre-image (say $y \in X$, i.e. $f(y) = B$) satisfies both $y \in B$ and $y \notin B$. On Wikipedia, this method is said to be analogous to Cantor's diagonal argument that is used to show that the interval $(0,1)$ of real numbers between $0$ and $1$ is uncountable. Here we assume that there exists an enumeration. Representing a number $x \in (0,1)$ in its unique decimal expansion, we obtain a list 
\begin{align}
x_1 &= 0.a_{11}a_{12}a_{13}... \\
x_2 &= 0.a_{21}a_{22}a_{23}... \\
x_2 &= 0.a_{31}a_{32}a_{33}... \\
x_2 &=0.a_{11}a_{12}a_{13}... \\
\vdots
\end{align}
where $a_{ij} \in \{0,1,\dots,9\}$ for each $i \in \mathbb{N}$ and $j \in \mathbb{N}$. Then one constructs an element from $(0,1)$ that is not in this list. For example, one can take the number $x = 0.b_{1}b_{2}b_{3}\dots$ where
\begin{equation}
b_i = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } a_{ii} = 5 \\ 5 & \text{if } a_{ii} \ne 5 
\end{cases}
\end{equation} Here, the number $x$ that is generated is well defined as an element of $(0,1)$, and it does not appear in the list above so we've reached a contradiction. On the other hand, for the argument above regarding the power set, assuming $f$ exists implies the object $B$ is not well defined as an element of $2^X$ since it is not the image of a function from $X$ to the set $\{0,1\}$ (it is multi-valued, namely the preimage of $B$ evaluates both to $0$ and $1$). In other words, I cannot use this object $B$ to derive a contradiction. What I can derive is that, if $f$ exists then $B$ is not a set, and if $B$ is a set for each function $f \colon 2^X \to X$ then no such $f$ can be surjective. The latter is what the proofs claim to be the only option, in other words this object $B$ must be a well defined set by some other reason - what am I missing?","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"
398045,probability of getting a double six ($2$ dice) rolling them $24$ times,"This is what I got. $\dfrac{1}{6} \cdot \dfrac{1}{6} = 2.78\% \cdot 24 = 66.72\%$ I believe that since it is a six sided dice, since you roll both of them simultaneously it would be $\dfrac{1}{6} \cdot \dfrac{1}{6}$. So since they are rolling them $24$ times, I would just multiply it by $24$, so $2.78\% * 24$ would be $66.72\%$, which would mean I have a  $67.7\%$ chance of rolling a double six.

398065,Understanding the (Partial) Converse to Cauchy-Riemann,"We have that for a function $f$ defined on some open subset $U  \subset \mathbb{C}$ then the following if true: Suppose $u=\mathrm{Re}(f), v=\mathrm{Im}(f)$ and that all partial derivatives $u_x,u_y,v_x,v_y$ exists and are continuous on $U$. Suppose further that they satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Then $f$ is holomorphic on $U$. The proof for this is readily available, though there is a subtlety that I can't understand. We essentially want to compute $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}$ where $h=p+qi \in \mathbb{C}$. We need a relationship like $u(x+p,y+q)-u(x,y)=pu_x(x,y)+qu_y(x,y)+o(|p|+|q|)$.
