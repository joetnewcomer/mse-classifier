485363,Tensoring a flasque resolution by a line bundle give s a flasque resolution,"I had an argument explained to me the other day and I didn't quite understand one of the steps.  Here's my best reconstruction: Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a quasi-coherent sheaf, and $\mathscr{L}$ a line
  bundle, on some scheme $X$.  Consider an injective, thus flasque,
  resolution $$ 0 \to \mathscr{F} \to \mathcal{J}_0 \to \mathcal{J}_1 \to \cdots$$ Tensoring by $\mathscr{L}$, we obtain a flasque resolution $$0 \to \mathscr{F} \otimes \mathscr{L} \to \mathcal{J}_0 \otimes
 \mathscr{L} \to \mathcal{J}_1 \otimes \mathscr{L} \to \cdots$$ of $\mathscr{F} \otimes \mathscr{L}$. Two questions: Is this correct as stated?  What is the proof? Why is the hypothesis that $\mathscr{L}$ is a line bundle needed?","['homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
485371,Domain for PDE Solution,"I'm working on PDE exercises for solutions via characteristics. The problems ask for the solution and its domain. For $$y^{-1}u_x + u_y = u^2, \quad u(x,1) = x^2$$
I found the solution to be 
$$ u(x,y) = \left( \frac{1}{(x- \ln |y|)^2} - y +1 \right) ^{-1}$$. So far, so good, but I can't find a clear way to express the domain. The best I've come up with is that it's ""the union of open connected sets $U \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $x \neq \ln |y|$ and $(x - \ln |y|)^2(y-1) \neq 1$ for all $(x,y) \in U$ and there exists a point $(x_0, 1) \in U$.    I.e., nothing in the solution breaks, and part of the initial data is in the set. For another, 
$$ u_x + u^{1/2} u_y = 0, \quad u(x,0) = x^2+1,$$
I get the implicit formula $u(x,y) = (x-\frac{y}{u(x,y)^{1/2}})^2 +1$, and here again, I don't see a good way to describe the domain. Is there some other way to express the solutions, or another way to think about them, which would make the domain clearer?

485423,Fictional math proof = prime return function,"I am trying to write a piece of future fiction where one of the characters is famous for proving an important truth related to primes.  I want to make it as realistic as possible, but i'm not a math major, and I need some guidance. Basically the ""function"" takes as any input an real number and returns (in a single step) a real number related to prime numbers.  so an integer like ""3"" returns the prime number ""5"", and something like ""3.5"" returns ""6"", a real number between prime #3 (5) and prime #4 (7). The function is also reversible, so any number can (again in a single step) be determined to be prime. e.g. input of ""29"" returns ""10"", and because that's an integer we know it's prime, and the 10th prime.  It would work both ways for any size of input number. What would be the downstream effects of such a ""function"" being proven true?  How would this kind of ""function"" open up new avenues of research in math?  Would something like this be more obscure and only known to mathematicians, or known broadly to the general public, or somewhere in between, like PoincarÃ©'s theorem?","['prime-numbers', 'recreational-mathematics', 'number-theory']"
485431,When should one use the two-point compactification of $\mathbb R$?,"The real line $\mathbb R$ has a one-point compactification $\mathbb R\cup\{\infty\}$, where this ""$\infty$"" is at both ends of the line, so that the compactification is topologically a circle. It also has a two-point compactification $\mathbb R\cup\{\pm\infty\}$. With rational functions $\lim\limits_{x\to\pm\infty}$ doesn't depend on whether it's $+$ or $-$.  With vertical asymptotes, if one wishes to distinguish between two different ways of blowing up, one could say $f(x)\to\infty\!-$, i.e. $f(x)$ approaches $\infty$ from below, instead of $f(x)\to+\infty$, and similarly for the other direction.  That makes rational functions continuous everywhere, including the points where they have vertical asymptotes and the point $x=\infty$. With trigonometric functions, one can take the domain to be $\mathbb R/2\pi\mathbb Z$ and the codomain to be $\mathbb R\cup\{\infty\}$ and treat vertical asymptotes as with rational functions.  That also makes trigonometric functions continuous even at points where they have vertical asymptotes, and the function $\theta\mapsto\tan(\theta/2)$ becomes a homeomorphism from $\mathbb R/2\pi\mathbb Z$ to $\mathbb R\cup\{\infty\}$. This seems like a more felicitous way of doing things than any that involves two infinities. When, then, should one distinguish between $\pm\infty$?  Part of the answer seems to be with exponential functions:
$$
e^x\to\begin{cases} 0 & \text{as }x\to-\infty, \\ \infty & \text{as }x\to+\infty. \end{cases}
$$
In that case, it doesn't seem to make as much sense to say ""as $x\to\infty\!+$"" and ""as $x\to\infty\!-$"".  Similarly
$$
\arctan x \to \pm\frac\pi2\text{ according as }x\to\pm\infty.
$$ Is there more to the story than that?  If not, should we abandon $\pm$ in the case of rational functions and trigonometric functions?","['general-topology', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"
485434,"What does ""generic"" mean in this context, and is it related to generic points in algebraic geometry?","In ""The characteristic polynomial and determinant are not ad hoc constructions"" by Skip Garibaldi, available at http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0203276 the characteristic polynomial is defined as the minimal polynomial of a ""generic element.""  Specifically, this is the setup: Let $F$ be a field and $A$ a finite-dimensional $F$-algebra. Let $\{a_1, \ldots, a_m\}$ be an $F$-basis for $A$. Let $R = F[t_1, \ldots, t_m]$ and $K = \operatorname{Frac} R = F(t_1,
> \ldots, t_m)$. Consider $\gamma = \sum_i a_i \otimes t_i \in A \otimes_F K$, which we
  call a generic element . Since $A \otimes_F K$ is a finite-dimensional $K$-vector space,
  $\operatorname{span} \{1, \gamma, \gamma^2, \ldots \}$ is
  finite-dimensional, so $\gamma$ has a minimal polynomial $m \in K[x]$,
  and it's easy to see that in fact $m \in R[x]$.  We define the
  characteristic polynomial of $a = \sum_i c_i a_i \in A$ to be the
  image of $m$ under the map $R[x] \to F[x]$ given by $t_i \mapsto c_i$. This is a nice argument, but it still feels a bit ad-hoc to me: we have to explicitly calculate that doesn't rely on the choice of $F$-basis, for instance, and why is $\gamma$ specifically a ""generic"" element of $A \otimes_F K$? I mean, I understand the idea of taking a matrix filled with indeterminates and computing its minimal polynomial, but it doesn't seem to be a natural thing to do from a purely algebraic perspective. Is there some way to rephrase this argument so that we can view $A$ as having a scheme structure and to regard $m$ as the ""minimal polynomial of the generic point"" or something of the sort?  I've tried a couple things but just get to a point where it seems like we're commingling elements of a -- is it called an ""algebra scheme?"" -- together with functions on it, and I get confused by the whole thing.  But that could just be my inexperience.","['linear-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

485515,Trigonometric equation in two ways gives different answer,"I have been given the equation $\sin^2 x+ \cos x +1 = 0.$ I tried to solve it in two ways. First, $1 - \cos^2(x) + \cos(x) + 1 = 0,$ $\cos^2(x) - \cos(x) - 2 = 0,$ $\cos x=2$ or $\cos x=-1$ thus $x=\pi+n2\pi$ for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}.$ Second approach. Let $\tan \frac{x}{2}=t.$ Then $\sin x=\frac{2t}{1+t^2}$ and $\cos x=\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.$ Thus the equation is
$$\left (\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\right )^2+\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}+1=0.$$ Therefore
$$4t^2+(1-t^2)(1+t^2)+(1+t^2)^2=0.$$ But $$4t^2+(1-t^2)(1+t^2)+(1+t^2)^2=4t^2+1-t^4+1+2t^2+t^4=6t^2+2>0.$$

(a) Prove that $S_n$ is doubly transitive on $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ for all $n â¥ 2$ . (b) Prove that a doubly transitive group is primitive. Deduce that $D_8$ is not doubly transitive in its action on the $4$ vertices of a square. ( Original image ) My Attempt: (a) $S_n$ is transitive on $\{1,2,\dotsc,n\}$ and for any $(i,j)\in G_a$ , $(i,j)i=j$ whence $G_a$ is transitive on $\{1,2,\dotsc,n\}-\{a\}$ . (b) Without loss of generality let $|A|\ge2$ . Case I: $|A|=2$ or $3$ then $|A-\{a\}|=1$ or $2$ whence the blocks became trivial. So $G$ become primitive in this case. Case II: $|A|\ge4$ then $|A-\{a\}|\ge3$ . $A-\{a\}$ canât have a nontrivial block $B$ since for any $i\in \{A-a\}-B$ and $j\in B$ , $(i,j)\in G_a$ and $(i,j)(B)$ is neither equal or disjoint with $B$ . Hence the result. $D_8$ is not doubly transitive: Label the four vertices as $1,2,3,4$ consecutively. Consider the action of $G_4,$ the stabilizer of $4,$ on $\{1,2,3\}$ . Then $\{1,3\}$ is a nontrivial block since $G_4$ contains only the reflection about the line of symmetry passing through $4$ and the identity. My Questions: Is my attempt correct? Do we define âblocksâ (and hence âprimitiveâ) only when $A$ is finite ? (Even though in this exercise I never used finiteness of $A$ this question comes into my mind from their definition as given in Dummit-Foote text: Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on a finite set $A$ . A block is a nonempty subset $B$ of $A$ such that for all $\sigma \in G$ , either $\sigma(B) = B$ or $\sigma(B) \cap B = \emptyset$ (here $\sigma(B)$ is the set $\{ \sigma(b) \mid b \in B \}$ . (a) Prove that if $B$ is a block containing the element $a$ of $A$ , then the set $G_B$ defined by $G_B = \{ \sigma \in G \mid \sigma(B) = B \}$ is a subgroup of $G$ containing $G_a$ . (b) Show that if $B$ is a block and $\sigma_1(B), \sigma_2(B), \dotsc, \sigma_n(B)$ are all the distinct images of $B$ under the elements of $G$ , then these form a partition of $A$ .

Remarks: $G = (V, E)$ with $V = U \cup W$ bipartite graph $s \le n = |V|$ cardinality of a maximum matching $S$ $M$ any matching in $G$ Moreover, I know that After every iteration there are no shortest path of length $l$ anymore. shortest $M$-augmenting paths extend by the additive factor of 2, since they always have odd length.

If $a\in A-S$, show that $aB\cap A=aA$. We write $B=A_S$ when $B$ is of this form. The next exercise is: (c) Let $A\subseteq B$, and suppose that there's a set $S$ as in Problem 18b with $B=A_S$. If $P$ is a prime ideal of $A$ with $P\cap S=\emptyset$, show that $PB$ is a prime ideal of $B$ and that $PB\cap A=P$. Exercise 18b is wrong.

485752,TicTacToe State Space Choose Calculation,"I understand there are numerous questions around the internet about the state space of tic-tac-toe but I have a feeling they've usually got it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it is I who have it wrong. Which is what leads me to my question. Common Over Estimates: Over Estimate One: First some common answers to the number of possible states in Tic-Tac-Toe: $9! = 362880$ This is one solution, which is overstates the upper-bound by the most I have seen, as it includes states such as: x1|o2|
--------
  |  |
--------
  |  | as well as: x2|o1|
--------
  |  |
--------
  |  | and all the other sequences of combinations possible. (Thank you to Exodus5 for pointing out the error.) Over Estimate Two: Another common answer that is better, common, but still over-estimating is: $3^9 = 19683$ Which is better. Now we only count the following board once... x|x|x
-----
x|x|x
-----
x|x|x but I've still never heard of any type of one-player tic-tac-toe and it seems boring. These guys claim they've got the answer but they are discussing games not state-spaces. That is the progression of the N-moves in a game is also taken into account. The Power of Choose: After sitting down and thinking for awhile I came up with a formula that does a more precise job at estimating the state space of tic-tac-toe and it is quite simple, but still not 100% as it still overestimates. $9 \choose 1$ * $8 \choose 0$ +
$9 \choose 1$ * $8 \choose 1$ +
$9 \choose 2$ * $7 \choose 1$ +
$9 \choose 2$ * $7 \choose 2$ +
$9 \choose 3$ * $6 \choose 2$ +
$9 \choose 3$ * $6 \choose 3$ +
$9 \choose 4$ * $5 \choose 3$ +
$9 \choose 4$ * $5 \choose 4$ +
$9 \choose 5$ * $4 \choose 4$ = 9+72+252+756+1260+1680+1260+630+127 = 6046 Edit: The final term above I had $4 \choose 5$ but the correct value is $4 \choose 4$ which yields the missing 1 from Immanuel's solution. Essentially each term of $9 \choose X$ is placing the X's on the board, then the $K \choose L$ is the O's choosing the appropriate number of places from the remaining open spaces on the board. Each term being added is the number of states being generated at each turn. So for turn 1 we have 9 states, for turn 2, 72 states and so on. The main point here is 6046 is far fewer than the other estimations, the use of Choose seems rather elegant considering its simplicity and the accuracy we are able to achieve, and lastly I like how each term being added correlates to each turn. I recognize that it is not perfect, as I am ignoring some win conditions, i.e. this board is also counted: x|x|x
-----
x|o|o
-----
x|o|o Which isn't a legitimate board but still 6045 is less than $1/3$ of the commonly stated $3^9$ and isn't the equation rather beautiful? The Question: The question is, does this application of choose accurately represent how X's and O's can alternatively be placed on a 3x3 grid? Have I missed anything? Bonus question: Any insights on how to estimate the number of illegitimate boards during moves 6, 7, 8, and 9? Note: With 5 or fewer moves, all boards generated are legitimate. The goal is not to have a computer brute force the thinking for us, but to gain a deeper understanding of the distribution of win conditions.

I want to get a mental picture of what these real numbers are, which you can't write down. At the end of this Wikipedia article en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_number it says To actually develop analysis over computable numbers, some care must be taken. For example, if one uses the classical definition of a sequence, the set of computable numbers is not closed under the basic operation of taking the supremum of a bounded sequence (for example, consider a Specker sequence). This difficulty is addressed by considering only sequences which have a computable modulus of convergence. The resulting mathematical theory is called computable analysis. So does this say that one has identified something uncomputable here? But if this is so, doesn't a description of such a thing give us a way of compute it or the object it represents? If we step by step forever strengthen our language, do we somehow obtain more numbers out of the set or $\mathbb R\setminus\mathrm{computable numbers}$?

485801,Fixed-Point Iteration method unable to converge to any of a function's infinte roots,"An equation is given to me which has to be solved by direct iteration method:
    $$\sin(x) = {x+1 \over x-1}$$ or $$f(x)=\sin(x)-{x+1 \over x-1} = 0$$ I follow the following procedure with reasons given along: Rearrange the equation as:
    $$x=\sin^{-1}{{x+1\over x-1}}=g(x)$$ Then, we get
    $$g'(x) = {1 \over (1-x)\sqrt{-x}}$$ $$\implies \forall x < -1, \left|g'(x)\right| < 1$$ Now, $\forall x < -1, 0 < {x+1 \over x-1} < 1$. But, $\sin{x}$ oscillates between 1 and -1 infinitely over the whole domain $\mathbb{R}$ and hence also its subset, the interval $(-\infty, -1)$. Thus, $\sin{x}$ intersects infinitely with ${x+1 \over x-1}$, at least once each time in its interval of size $\pi$. These intersection points are exactly the roots of $f(x)$ over the interval $\left(-\infty, -1\right)$. Thus, if we choose arbitrary points $a,b < -1 : a - b \ge \pi$, then $\sin{x}$ goes from -1 to 1 at least once, and since ${x+1 \over x-1}$ is always between 0 and 1, the period contains a root of $f(x)$. Thus, to summarize, we have got a function $g(x)$ which is defined over the negative number line, and is bounded and continuous there. On the negative number line, we also have an interval $(a, b)$ where we have a root of given equation. Also, derivative of $g(x)$ is numerically less than one in the given interval. So, ideally, I should be able to take any value of $x = x_0$ in $(a, b)$ and should be able to get increasing better iterates. But the fact that my function $g(x)$ is $\sin^{-1}{{x + 1 \over x - 1}}$ means that any negative value of $x < -1 $yields me a positive value of iterate in the next step, which in turn leads to domain error. Where am I wrong? Or more precisely, are there any more conditions that are required for the fixed-point iterative method that are not known to me. One step which seems dubious to me is the very first step where I take $\sin^{-1}$ of original equation on the both sides, to get the $g(x)$, but I am not able to pinpoint how it can derail my method. Update : Renamed the method from direct iterative method to fixed-point iteration method. Also, as is noted in the comments below, problem seems to be in my choice of $g(x)$ only.

The only explanation I've ever seen is that a set is measurable if it 'breaks up' other sets in the way you'd want. I don't really see why this is the motivation though. One reason I am not comfortable with it is that you require a measurable set to break up sets which, according to this definition, are non-measurable; why would you require that? Of course, you can't say what a non-measurable set is without first defining what it means to be measurable so I suppose no matter what your condition is, it will have to apply to all subsets of $X$.

$$
\forall \omega \in \Omega, \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists n \in \mathbb{N}: k \ge n \rightarrow |1_{A_k}(\omega) - 1_A(\omega) | < \varepsilon.

485935,Piecewise interpolation with derivatives that is also twice differentiable,"This question regards the issue of interpolation of one dimension real functions. If one has a finite set of function values and its corresponding derivatives, one could find unique continuous piecewise cubic function that interpolates those points and has the desired derivatives. This function is at least once-differentiable and in the general case is not twice-differentiable as the second derivative is discontinuous. On the other hand a cspline-interpolation (with some boundary conditions) of those same points gives a three twice-differentiable function (but does not respect the values of the derivatives at the points). In other words, the cspline is the only cubic spline that is twice differentiable, which makes me think that if I want a twice-differentiable interpolation with derivatives I will need a higher order interpolation. For example quartic or quintic. The question is, does interpolation with derivatives that is also twice-differentialy exists already? In practice, should it be quartic or quintic? Is there any reference or numerical implementation for it? (I experimented with quartic interpolation --for values only-- in the past, but as it is well-know, even-number order interpolations produce unstable oscillations making it unsuitable for numerical approximation, which discourages me from trying quartic order interpolation) Here it is an illustration of function interpolation of values (on the right) and derivative values (on the left) (in this example the value of the derivative is choosen to be 1 in the sample data for illustration only)","['interpolation', 'spline', 'continuity', 'derivatives']"
485937,Interspersing of integers by rationals,"I'm wondering if the next argument is sound or maybe need some adjustments; Proposition (Interspersing of integers by rationals): Let $x\in \mathbb{Q}$. Then there exists an integer such that $n\le x< n+1$. In fact this integer is unique. In particular, there exists a natural number $N$ such that $N>x$ (i.e. there is no such thing as a rational number which is larger than all the natural numbers). Proof: By the trichotomy property of the rational numbers, either $x$ is positive, negative or zero. If $x=0$, it's trivial since $\,0 \le x<1$. Now if $x$ is positive number, by definition $x= \frac{p}{q}$ where $p,q\in \mathbb{N}- \left\{0 \right\}$. Then using the Euclidean algorithm we have that: $$p = mq+r, \text{  where   } \:\: 0 \le r < q $$ We shall show that the natural number $m$ has the desired property $\,m \le x < m+1$. It is sufficient to show that $\,\,0 \le x-m<1$. $x -m= \frac{p}{q}-m =\frac{mq+r}{q}-{m} = \frac{r}{q}$. Since by the Euclidean algorithm we know that $\,0 \le r < q$  then $\,0 \le \frac{r}{q} <1$ as desired. Now suppose there is a $n \not= m $ such that $p = nq+r$. So, $\,mq+r = nq+r$ and we conclude that $m=n$ which show the uniqueness of $m$. If $x$ is a negative rational number, we have that $x = \frac{-a\,}{\,\,\,b\,}$ where $a,b\in \mathbb{N}- \left\{0\right\}$, so $-x = \frac{a}{b}$ and we may  use the same argument that in the positive case. To conclude we need to show that the integer is unique and is follows of the above argument. I feel that the argument is a bit flawed, I would appreciate any suggestion.

485959,"Primary decomposition of an ideal (exercise 7.8 in Reid, Undergraduate Commutative Algebra) [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : What is a primary decomposition of the ideal $I = \langle xy, x - yz \rangle$? (2 answers) Closed 10 years ago . I would like to understand how to use geometry to solve the problem 7.8 from Reid's book Undergraduate Commutative Algebra . The problem is the following Let $k$ be a field and consider the ideal $I = (xy, x - yz) \subset k[x,y,z]$. Find a primary decomposition of $I$. So the vanishing locus $V(I)$ is the two axis $Y$ and $Z$, and if $I = q_1 \cap \cdots \cap q_n$ with all $q_i$ being $p_i$-primary, we could guess that we can take $p_1 = (x,z)$ and $p_2 = (x,y)$. Moreover, the vanishing of $xy$ is the $Z$-axis, but with double multiplicity (is this true ?), so we could guess to take $q_2 = (x,y)^2$, but we need $x - yz$ to be in there, so I think that $q_2 = (xy, y^2, x - yz)$ and $q_1 = (x,z)$ would give a decomposition into primary ideals ($x^2$ is automatically in $q_2$, don't need it). Question 1 : How to make sure that these primes $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the only ones ? We can compute them by $\operatorname{Ass}(k[x,y,z]/(xy,x - yz))$, but wasn't able to do it. Question 2 : Is $(x,z) \cap (xy, y^2, x - yz)$ a primary decomposition of $I$ ? Question 3 : What is a better way to get to this answer with geometric intuition and not algebraic brute-force ?

486025,Geometric intuition for the tensor product of vector spaces,"First of all, I am very comfortable with the tensor product of vector spaces. I am also very familiar with the well-known generalizations, in particular the theory of monoidal categories. I have gained quite some intuition for tensor products and can work with them. Therefore, my question is not about the definition of tensor products, nor is it about its properties. It is rather about the mental images. My intuition for tensor products was never really geometric . Well, except for the tensor product of commutative algebras, which corresponds to the fiber product of the corresponding affine schemes. But let's just stick to real vector spaces here, for which I have some geometric intuition, for example from classical analytic geometry. The direct product of two (or more) vector spaces is quite easy to imagine: There are two (or more) ""directions"" or ""dimensions"" in which we ""insert"" the vectors of the individual vector spaces. For example, the direct product of a line with a plane is a three-dimensional space. The exterior algebra of a vector space consists of ""blades"", as is nicely explained in the Wikipedia article . Now what about the tensor product of two finite-dimensional real vector spaces $V,W$? Of course $V \otimes W$ is a direct product of $\dim(V)$ copies of $W$, but this description is not intrinsic, and also it doesn't really incorporate the symmetry $V \otimes W \cong W \otimes V$. How can we describe $V \otimes W$ geometrically in terms of $V$ and $W$? This description should be intrinsic and symmetric. Note that SE/115630 basically asked the same, but received no actual answer. The answer given at SE/309838 discusses where tensor products are used in differential geometry for more abstract notions such as tensor fields and tensor bundles, but this doesn't answer the question either. (Even if my question gets closed as a duplicate, then I hope that the other questions receive more attention and answers.) More generally, I would like to ask for a geometric picture of the tensor product of two vector bundles on nice topological spaces. For example, tensoring with a line bundle is some kind of twisting. But this is still some kind of vague. For example, consider the MÃ¶bius strip on the circle $S^1$, and pull it back to the torus $S^1 \times S^1$ along the first projection. Do the same with the second projection, and then tensor both. We get a line bundle on the torus, okay, but how does it look like geometrically? Perhaps the following related question is easier to answer: Assume we have a geometric understanding of two linear maps $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, $g : \mathbb{R}^{n'} \to \mathbb{R}^{m'}$. Then, how can we imagine their tensor product $f \otimes g : \mathbb{R}^n \otimes \mathbb{R}^{n'} \to \mathbb{R}^m \otimes \mathbb{R}^{m'}$ or the corresponding linear map $\mathbb{R}^{n n'} \to \mathbb{R}^{m m'}$ geometrically? This is connected to the question about vector bundles via their cocycle description.","['geometry', 'vector-bundles', 'tensor-products', 'linear-algebra', 'intuition']"
486029,Teams in tournament problem,"I have a practical math problem that I can't solve by myself.
The problem is probably already solved by other people but I can't think of any
Google 
search words.
If somebody knows a solution or is willing to try and solve it that would be
awesome.
I need a algorithm to plan some kind of tournament. I wrote an algorithm in
Mathematica 
that tries randomly to find the best option but it would take thousands of years
to solve the 
problem that way. This is the problem: There are a total of p people, they are distributed over teams.
Ever round g different games are played, t teams play game A, t teams play game
B etc. for 
all g games. (So the total number of teams is t*g.) For instance:
g = 5, t=3 (so there a 15 teams) ....................Round 1......................Round 2............. Round 3
etc. etc. Game A:.....1 vs 2 vs 3..............4 vs 8 vs 15...............etc. Game B:.....4 vs 5 vs 6.................1 vs 7 vs 12................etc. Game C:.....7 vs 8 vs 9.................2 vs 10 vs 13..............etc. Game D:....10 vs 11 vs 12...........3 vs 6 vs 14.................etc. Game E:.....13 vs 14 vs 15...........5 vs 9 vs 11................etc. Rule 1: Every team has to play every game at least once, but no more than
strictly necessary 
to make all rules work. Rule 2: Every team has to play against every other team ,so team 1 has to play
team 2,3,4...15 
(team 2 has to play team all other teams etc. etc.). If team 1 already played
team 12, they can 
only play each other again if it's strictly necessary to make the rules work. In
the example 
above there was a match ""1 vs 7 vs 12"" so later on match ""1 vs 12 vs 9"" may only
happen is 
there is no other option. Rule 3: If a team has to play a game more than once, it's better if there is a
pause between 
those games (so not in successive rounds). Rule 4: If a team has to play a other team more than once, it's better if there
is a pause 
between those games (so not in successive rounds). Rule 5: If the people can't be distributed equally over the teams (for instance
p=147 and 
there are 15 teams, three teams will be smaller), smaller teams shouldn't play
each other if 
possible. So if team 13, 14 and 15 are smaller match ""13 vs 14 vs 15"" should be
avoided if 
possible. (While match ""13 vs 14 vs ..."" can't be avoided since team 13
has to play team 14 at 
least once.) The rules are ordered according to importance, rule 1 is the most important. The answer to this problem may be given in any form: group theory, graphs,
algebra ect.

application. Of course every little tip is very welcome, it doesn't have to be a

486051,Are there cases where the difference between a partial and total derivative is purely reliant on syntax?,"It's always seemed to me that the difference between a partial and total derivative is artificial. I'm not sure how I'm wrong but surely, I must be. An example of my confusion is the function f(x,t)=x^2+t where x(t)=t. If I take the partial derivative of f w.r.t t, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$=1.
Now suppose I take the partial again, but this time I substitute first. f(x(t),t)=t^2+t. This time $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$=2t+1.
This confuses me because, surely the result of a partial derivative relies only on the function f, and can't be dependent on my choice of how to write it. Unless the partial derivative is really such a whimsical, subjective operator.","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-derivative']"
486058,Does the boundary of a handle decomposition obtain a handle decomposition?,"Let $M$ be the $4$-manifold $D^4\cup2\text{-handle}\cup\ldots\cup2\text{-handle}$, where the attachment of the handles is specfied by an oriented framed link $L=L_1\cup\ldots\cup L_n\subseteq S^3$. By Lickorish's theorem any smooth closed connected orientable 3-manifold can be obtained in this way as $\partial M$. For example, if $L$ consists of only one unknot with framing $n$, then $\partial M$ is the lens space $L(1,n)$. Thus in general, $H_1\partial M$ can be any finitely generated abelian group. Does $\partial M$ obtain a handle decomposition from the one on $M$? I know that $\partial M$ is obtained as $S^3$ with $n$ $1$-surgeries. I would like to show that $H_1\partial M\cong \mathbb{Z}^n/\mathrm{Im}A$, where $A\in\mathbb{Z}^{n\times n}$ has on the diagonal the framings of $L_1,\ldots,L_n$ and at $ij$-th place the linking number of $L_i,L_j$.

It would be desirable if the handle decomposition on $M$ which is uniquely specified by the link $L$ would induce a handle decomposition on $\partial M$, which would also be specified by $L$. If $\partial M$ had only $1$ $0$-handle and $n$ $1$-handles, then $\partial_1:\mathbb{Z}^{1\text{-handles}}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}^{0\text{-handles}}$ would be the zero map, so $H_1\partial M=\mathbb{Z}^n/\mathrm{Im}\partial_2$ and then wishfully $\partial_2=A$.

There is a lightswitch on the arm of your chair. Every time you flip the switch, some subset of the lightbulbs turn on. This subset can vary between flips. Your guess is that each of the lightbulbs has an intrinsic probability of being illuminated when you flip the switch, and that this probability is pairwise independent of the other lightbulbs.  In other words, for each lightbulb $i$ and $j$, you predict that $$\operatorname{P}\left(i\text{ and }j\text{ both illuminated}\right)=\operatorname{P}\left(i\text{ illuminated}\right)\operatorname{P}\left(j\text{ illuminated}\right)$$ To test this, you flip the lightswitch a whole bunch of times, each time recording the subsets of activated lightbulbs as $S_m$ (if you're on the $m^\text{th}$ flip).  Afterwards, you record the number of times each lightbulb lit up as $$c_i=\left|\{m:i \in S_m \}\right|,$$ and, similarly, for each pair of lightbulbs $i$ and $j$, you set $$c_{ij}=\left|\{m:\{i,j\}\subseteq S_m \}\right|.$$ Note that if the lightbulbs really are illuminated pairwise independently of one another, we would see $$\ell_{ij}:=\frac{c_ic_j}{c_{ij}}\longrightarrow 1$$ for every $i,j$ as the sample size grows large.  Naturally, we consider the matrix $\ell\in M_{n\times n}$ with entries $\ell_{ij}$.

He is proving a $L^p$ version of the Dirichlet problem which states that if $F(t)$ is in $L^p$ on the unit circle then $$ U_{r}(\theta)=F\ast P_{r}(\theta)$$ 
is harmonic in the open unit disk. He does this by noticing 
$$
U_{r}(\theta)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} A_n r^{|n|} e^{i n \theta}.
$$
We get this from noting that the Poisson kernel has the form
$$
P_{r}(\theta)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}r^{|n|} e^{i n\theta},
$$
where the sum converges uniformly on compact subsets of the open unit disk.
Since we have uniform convergence, we can interchange the summation and integral to get the form above. My question is this: if the partial sums
$$
\sum_{n=-N}^{N}A_n r^{|n|}e^{i n \theta}
$$
satisfy Laplace's equation, does the limit satisfy it as well? The limit function would have the mean value property since the partial sums do, but is this equivalent to harmonicity? EDIT:
I actually proved the result myself. The last summand, when split between summing $n\geq 0$ and $n<0$, is the sum of an analytic function and a conjugate analytic function. We know this because the partial sums converge uniformly on compact subsets, preserving holomorphicity. Thus, the real and imaginary parts are harmonic.

UPDATE Thanks to comments from @achille. From the perspective of dimensional analysis , in the Laplacian of Gaussian operator
$$LoG(x,y,\sigma)=\frac{\partial^2g}{\partial x^2} +\frac{\partial^2g}{\partial y^2}$$, I think $x,y$ are variables with dimension $L$, $\sigma$ is a parameter with dimension $L$. But what about $g$? Since $g$ is a function of $x,y,\sigma$,
$$g(x,y,\sigma)=\frac{1}{2\pi \sigma^2}exp(-\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\sigma^2})$$,
and $x,y,\sigma$ are of the same dimension $L$, so I guess in $g$, the term $exp(-\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\sigma^2})$ is dimensionless, isn't it? And the term $\frac{1}{2\pi \sigma^2}$ is of dimension $L^{-2}$, right? So $g$ is actually of dimension $L^{-2}$, isn't it? Now come back to $LoG$, it should have dimension $L^{-4}$? UPDATE 2 Laplacian operator is 
$$\nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}$$,
and a Gaussian function's scale is $\sigma$, right? If I apply $\nabla^2$ on a Gaussian function $g(x,y,\sigma)$, what is difference of applying the dimensionless $\sigma^2*\nabla^2$?","['image-processing', 'derivatives']"

486332,Almost Everywhere pointwise limit measurable functions measurable?,"I'm having difficulties verifying a remark in Raymond Ryan's treatment of the Bochner Integral. $\bf{\text{Remark:}}$ If $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, and $(f_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of $\mu$-measurable functions which converges to $f$ almost everywhere, then $f$ is $\mu$-measurable. $\bf{\text{Edit:}}$ At this point I am currently looking for an authoritative answer on what the hypothesis of this remark should be, given the comments below. $\bf{\text{Background:}}$ Let $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space, and $X$ be a Banach space. A function $f:\Omega\to X$ is simple if it assumes only finitely many values.  That is, there exists subsets $E_{1}, ... , E_{n}$ of $\Omega$ and scalars $x_{1}, ... , x_{n}\in X$ such that $f = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\chi_{E_{i}}x_{i}$. If the sets $E_{i}$ can be chosen from $\Sigma$, then $f$ is $\mu$-measurable simple. A function $f:\Omega\to X$ is $\mu$-measurable if it is the limit of a sequence of $\mu$-measurable simple functions (almost everywhere). A function $f:\Omega\to X$ is $\mu$-essentially separately valued if there exists $E\in \Sigma$ such that $\mu(\Omega\backslash E) = 0$ and $f(E)\subset Y$ for some separable subspace $Y$ of $X$. These are the immediately preceding results (which may or may not be useful). $\bf{\text{Lemma:}}$  Let $\mu$ be $\sigma$-finite.  $f:\Omega\to X$ is $\mu$-measurable if and only if $\chi_{E}f$ is $\mu$-measurable for every $E\in \Sigma$, $\mu(E) < \infty$. Proof (My previous question): Fact about measurable functions defined on $\sigma$-finite measure spaces. $\bf{\text{(Pettis Measurability Theorem)}}$  Let $\mu$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure.  The following are equivalent for $f:\Omega\to X$. (i) $f$ is $\mu$-measurable. (ii) $f$ is weakly $\mu$-measurable and $\mu$-essentially separately valued. (iii) $f$ is Borel measurable and $\mu$-essentially separately valued. Sorry for not having much of a start yet.  My ideas consisted of trying to adapt the solution given as an answer to my previous question: Fact about measurable functions defined on $\sigma$-finite measure spaces. but sadly went nowhere.  I'm just looking for a hint not a full solution if possible. $\bf{\text{Regarding My Issues Below:}}$ In Norbert's proof: Case (1): The functions $f_{n}$ are each $\mu$-measurable simple as they can be written as $f_{n} = \chi_{\phi}$ and $\phi\in\Sigma$.  Since $f_{n}\to\chi_{F}$ at every point outside of $F$, then by definition, $\chi_{F}$ is $\mu$-measurable.  So I don't think a contradiction exists here. Case (2): Before completeness is invoked, we have that since $f_{n}$ is $\mu$-measurable, $x^{*}\circ f_{n}$ is a $\mu$-measurable scalar valued function on $E$ for every $x^{*}\in X^{*}$.  Therefore it is concluded that $x^{*}\circ f$ is a $\mu$-measurable scalar valued function on $E$ for every $x^{*}\in X^{*}$.  I cannot manage to prove the details on this last step; it seems to actually require the remark which is to be proved? $\bf{\text{Follow Up:}}$  I think I have found the heart of the matter, which I have posted as a separate question: Contradiction achieved with the Pettis Measurability Theorem?","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

486428,Asymptotic Expansion of a Two Variable Function,"How is the double asymptotic expansion defined? I can't seem to find it anywhere. Suppose $$f(x)\sim \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\phi_n(x)$$ as described in the Wikipedia article .  How is then, for instance, $f(x,y)$ defined asymptotically? What are its general properties? Any similarities with the one-variable case? I'm trying to generalize the notion of asymptotic expansion to the two variable case. Does the following mean anything to you (I just made it up): $$f(x,y) \sim \sum_{m,n} a_m x^m b_n y^n$$ such that the difference $$f(x,y)-\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}a_mx^m\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}a_ny^n\in \mathcal{O}(x^my^n)$$ as $(x,y)\rightarrow(0,0)$ Does that make sense?","['asymptotics', 'complex-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
486431,Stratifications by smooth subvarieties,"Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field $k$.
Then $X$ is said to have a stratification if one can find irreducible locally closed subsets $X_i\subset X$ such that $X=\coprod X_i$ and whenever $\overline X_i$ intersects $X_j$ one has $\overline X_i\supseteq X_j$. Question :
Does every algebraic variety $X$ has a stratification by smooth subvarieties? To show the answer is yes (which I believe, but do not know), I tried to play with the smooth locus of the irreducible components, taking the interior and so on, but something possibly singular always seemed to pop out at the end. If there is any hypothesis one has to add on $X$ to get an affirmative answer, or if one has to relax a bit the definition of stratification, that would also be very useful to me. Thank you for any help.",['algebraic-geometry']
