554183,Trick: Substitution in inverse trigonometry.,"My friends say, it is some what difficult to know, which trigonometric function has to be substituted in the inverse trigonometric equations, to get the correct solution. So, I thought to take up this issue. Consider the below equation, which has to be reduced to it's simplest form. $$\begin{equation}\arctan\frac{\sqrt{1+x^2}-1}{x},x\neq0\end{equation}$$ We can see that, $x$ can take any value other than $0$. So, $x$ can be replaced with any trig function, which gives all the values fetched by $x$. We have six trig functions, which one should we substitute? Should we try with all six trig functions one by one? We  can make some thought process to answer the above questions. $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$ values are restricted to the interval  $[-1,1 ]$, but $x$ can have any value other than $0$, which can be greater than $1$ or it can be lesser than $-1$. So, cos and sine functions can't be substituted for $x$. $cosec\theta$ and $\sec\theta$ vaues are restricted to the interval $R-(-1,1)$, but $x$ can have values in the open interval $(-1,1)$ except $0$. So, cosec and sec functions can't be substituted for $x$. $\cot\theta$ and $\tan\theta$ values cover the entire real numbers. So, cot and tan are the only two functions which can be substituted in the equation for $x$. We can try for other problems, we get best results . I thought this is the better place to discuss about this, so that any one can leave their ideas/techiniques of how they solved problems using substitution.","['trigonometry', 'inverse']"

554193,Path connectedness is a topological invariant?,"$\textbf{PROBLEM}$ Path-connectedness is a topological invariant MY try: we can show that the image of a path connected space $X$ under a continuous mapping is path connected Suppose $X$ is path connected space. let $\gamma : X \to Y$ be continuous bijective map. Take $x,y \in Y$, then can find $x',y' \in X$ such that $\gamma(x') = x$ and $\gamma(y')=y$. We know $X$ is path connected. Therefore, we can find a path $f$ from $x'$ to $y'$. in other words, such that $f(a) = x'$ and $f(b) = y'$. But then notice $\gamma f (a) = x$ and $\gamma f (b) =  y$. Therefore, $\gamma f$ is a path from $x$ to $y$. In particular, $Y$ is path connected. MY question is: I feel like I haven't used the fact the $\gamma$ is injective. Is it necessary? Is this a correct approach to the problem? Thanks","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"
554262,"sufficient condition for a polynomial to have roots in $[0,1]$","Question is to check : which of the following is sufficient condition for a polynomial $f(x)=a_0 +a_1x+a_2x^2+\dots +a_nx^n\in \mathbb{R}[x] $ to have a root in $[0,1]$. $a_0 <0$ and $a_0+a_1+a_2+\dots +a_n >0$ $a_0+\frac{a_1}{2}+\frac{a_2}{3}+\dots +\frac{a_n}{n+1}=0$ $\frac{a_0}{1.2}+\frac{a_1}{2.3}+\dots+\frac{a_n}{(n+1).(n+2)} =0$ First of all i tried by considering degree $1$ polynomial and then degree $2$ polynomial and then degree $3$ polnomial hoping to see some patern but could not make it out. And then, I saw that $a_0= f(0)$ and $f(1)=a_0+a_1+a_2+\dots +a_n$. So, if $f(0)<0$ and $f(1)>0$ it would be sufficient for $f$ to have root in $[0,1]$ In first case we have $a_0 <0$ i.e., $f(0)<0$ and $f(1)>1>0$. So, first condition should be implying existence of a root in $[0,1]$ for second case, let $f(x)$ be a linear polynomial i.e., $f(x)=a_0+a_1x$ Now, $a_0+\frac{a_1}{2}=0$ implies $0\leq x=\frac{-a_0}{a_1}=\frac{1}{2}< 1$ So, this might be possibly give existence in case of linear polynomials. Now, $\frac{a_0}{1.2}+\frac{a_1}{2.3}=0$implies $0\leq x=\frac{-a_0}{a_1}=\frac{1}{3}< 1$ So, this might be possibly give existence in case of linear polynomials. So, for linear polynomials all the three conditions imply existence of a root in $[0,1]$. But, i guess this can not be generalized for higher degree polynomial. I think there should be some ""neat idea"" than checking for roots and all. I am sure about first case but I have no idea how to consider the other two cases. please provide some hints to proceed further.","['real-analysis', 'polynomials']"

554322,Why in differential geometry tensors are usually defined as multilinear maps?,"In multilinear algebra books tensors are usually defined through the universal property. Given a family of $k$ vector spaces $V_1,\dots,V_k$ over the same field $F$ we want to construct a space $S$ and a map $T:V_1\times\cdots\times V_k\to S$ such that for every vector space $W$ and multilinear $f:V_1\times\cdots\times V_k\to W$ we have a unique linear $g:S\to W$ such that $f = g\circ T$. We then put $S=F(V_1\times\cdots\times V_k)/S_0$ where $S_0$ is generated by all elements of $F(V_1\times\cdots\times V_k)$ with the form $$(v_1,\dots,v_i'+v_i'',\dots,v_k)-(v_1,\dots,v_i',\dots,v_k)-(v_1,\dots,v_i'',\dots,v_k)$$
$$(v_1,\dots,kv_i,\dots,v_k)-k(v_1,\dots,v_i,\dots,v_k).$$ Then we write $S=V_1\otimes\cdots \otimes V_k$ and denote $T(v_1,\dots,v_k)=v_1\otimes \cdots \otimes v_k$. This is a good definition, motivated by an algebraic problem. In differential geometry books, however, tensors on a vector space $V$ are defined as multilinear functions from $V^k$ to $\Bbb R$. The motivation obviously is that we are building objects that in some sense given $k$ directions is capable of giving a number being linear in each direction. They usually denote $T_k(V)$ the space of such tensors. Now, the space $T_k(V)$ is isomorphic to $V^{\otimes k}$, so my doubt is not that. My doubt is: is there some benefit of working in differential geometry with the spaces $T_k(V)$ rather than $V^{\otimes k}$? From the geometrical point of view, is there some difference between working with $T_k(V)$ and $V^{\otimes k}$? There's one similar question here but I didn't find an answer there.

554390,Homework - countable infinity,"I'm trying to solve 2 problems, but I'm having some issues and would appreciate help.
Here are the questions and what I thought could be done: 1) A is the set of all series of numbers, where in an even place there is an even number, and in an odd place there is an odd number (for example, the series {8,3,2,5,0,1,28,...} is a valid member of A). Is A of countable cardinality? If it is, find a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. My solution: I thought of sending a series, to a natural number. like, the example we got? I would send that series to the number 83250128 but I don't think thats a good solution... 2) B is the set of all series that only contain values that are prime numbers.

554397,Effect of pullback of differential forms on an ideal,"Say that the exterior differential system (EDS) corresponding to a PDE system is: $$df-f_x\,dx-f_y\,dy-f_w\,dw-f_z\,dz=0,\\
a_1\,f_x+a_2\,f_y=0,\tag{sys}$$ Of course we also require the independence condition, $dx\wedge dy\wedge dw\wedge dz\neq 0$. Instead of (sys) can I simply use the following?
$$ df +\dfrac{a_2}{a_1}f_y\,dx-f_y\,dy-f_w\,dw-f_z\,dz=0 \tag{sys$^\prime$}$$ I guess what I'm asking above is whether the ideal generated by $$\theta=df +\dfrac{a_2}{a_1}f_y\,dx-f_y\,dy-f_w\,dw-f_z\,dz$$ coincides with the pull-back of the ideal generated by the contact form ($i.e.$ the left-hand side of first line in sys) to the manifold in jet space given by the second line of sys? I think the answer is yes because the pullback to the manifold in jet space defined by 
$a_1\,f_x+a_2\,f_y=0$ commutes with the exterior product and with the exterior derivative so the ideal generated by $\mathrm{sys^\prime}$ will coincide with the pullback of the ideal generated by $\mathrm{sys}$ but not 100% sure. Sorry if all of this obvious but I'm not a mathematician. Besides Bryant et. al. I'm using ""Cartan for Beginners"" and ""Lie's Structural Approach to PDE Systems"".

554449,Explanation of Radon-Nikodym derivates wrt to probabilities,"I am currently working in communications, where a lot of work is done via probability calculations (densities and such). As I am not a mathematician, I do have a quite hard time understanding one specific aspect. I know what the mathematical definition looks like, but I just can't really find a way to imagine it in terms of things I know about stocastics and probability theory. So here is my problem: In the work of a specific author, he doesn't deal with densities, but with Radon-Nikodym derivates instead. One example would be the Kullback-Leibler-divergence. I ""know"" it as $D(P||Q) = \int p(x) log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} dx$ where p and q are some pdfs. Whereas in his work he states it as $D(P||Q) = \int \frac{dP}{dQ} log \frac{dP}{dQ} \cdot dQ$ (I know that this formula can also be found on wikipedia) with $ \frac{dP}{dQ} $ being the Radon-Nikodym derivative So here is the actual question: How or what can I imagine this Radon-Nikodym derivative to be like? Comparing the formulas, in this case it would be something like ""dP = p(x)"". I am thankful for any explanation or reading tips, but please don't just answer the definition. I looked it up.

Initially (at time 0), the men at vertices A and D hold a ball each. The game ends when any man receives the two balls simultaneously. Before the game ends, and at times 1,2,..., any man holding exactly 1 ball throws it to his clockwise neighbour with probability a (where 0 < a < 1), or to his anti-clockwise neighbour with probability b (1 - a). All such actions are independent. The game can be modelled as a Markov chain by defining state k , k = 0,1,2,3, as the distance between the 2 balls, measured in number of sides covered by the shorter route around the polygon. The diagram is as shown: (a) What is the transition probability matrix? (b) Find all the classes of the Markov chain. Is there any closed class? Is there any recurrent class? State your reasons briefly. (c) Find the expected number of times the 2 balls are held by two men who are neighbours of each other.

and the projective parabola $X=\operatorname{Proj}(R)$. Let $I=\langle y,z\rangle\subseteq R$ be the homogeneous ideal generated by $y$ and $z$, and consider the ideal sheaf $\newcommand{\cL}{\mathscr{L}}\cL:=I(1)^\sim$, as in, $\cL(X)=I_1=\Bbbk y \oplus \Bbbk z$.

But my question removes the $ln$ and I am wondering whether it will still be true. In fact, I hypothesize that not only is it true for the $ln$ function, but it will be true for any function that is increasing (which includes the identity function, which is my question here). So as a bonus, maybe we could ask if $E[h(f(X))] \ge E[h(g(X))]$ where $h$ is any strictly increasing function on positive reals. It seems like a continuous form of the rearrangement inequality to me.","['statistics', 'inequality', 'expectation']"

554835,Weak implicit function theorem. Is my proof alright?,"I want to prove that if we have $ f \in C(A \times U,Y)$, where $x_0 \in U$, $\lambda_0 \in A$ and A and U are open sets in Banach spaces and Y is a Banach space too and we have that: $f(\lambda_0,x_0)=0$ and $f_x(\lambda_0,x_0)$ is invertible and the inverse map is bounded and $f_x \in C(A \times U, L(U,Y))$, then we have that there is a continuous curve $x(\lambda)$ in a surrounding of $x_0$, such that $f(\lambda, x(\lambda))=0$ My idea was the following: Look at $F(x,\lambda):= x - (f_x (\lambda_0,x_0))^{-1}f(\lambda,x)$ 
(The subscript x always denotes the partial derivative with respect to this coordinate).
Then we have: $F_x(x,\lambda):= \operatorname{id} - (f_x (\lambda_0,x_0))^{-1}f_x(\lambda,x)$ Therefore we have that $\| F(\lambda,x) - F(\lambda,x')\| \le \sup_{\xi} \| F_x(\lambda,\xi)\| \|x-x'\|$ Now we want to get a contraction by choosing $x \in B_{\epsilon}(x_0)$ and $\lambda \in B_{\delta}(\lambda_0)$( notice that both balls shall be closed in order to apply Banach's fixed point theorem) such that: $$\|F_x(\lambda, x)\| =\| \operatorname{id} - (f_x (\lambda_0,x_0))^{-1}f_x(\lambda,x)\| \le \|f_x (\lambda_0,x_0))^{-1}\| \|f_x (\lambda_0,x_0) -f_x (\lambda,x))\| \le \|f_x (\lambda_0,x_0))^{-1}\|( \|f_x (\lambda_0,x_0) -f_x (\lambda,x_0))\| +  \|f_x (\lambda,x_0) -f_x (\lambda,x)\|) =: L < 1$$ This is possible since $f_x$ is continuous. Therefore, we have a contraction and we get by Banach's fixed point theorem a unique continuous function $x$ such that $x(\lambda) = F(\lambda,x(\lambda))$ for every lambda and since we know from $f(\lambda_0,x_0)=0$ that for $\lambda_0$ we have $F(\lambda_0,x(\lambda_0)) = x(\lambda_0)$, this function $x$ does what I want.

554841,Can a meager linear subspace be written as a countable increasing union of nowhere dense subspaces?,"Let $X$ be a separable Banach space.  In this question, ""subspace"" means a linear subspace, not necessarily closed. Suppose $E \subset X$ is a subspace which is meager, so that we can write $E = \bigcup_n E_n$, where the $E_n$ are nowhere dense subsets of $X$.  Without loss of generality, we can also take $E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \cdots$.  Can the $E_n$ be taken to be subspaces of $X$?  That is, can a meager subspace always be written as a countable increasing union of nowhere dense subspaces? Note that the linear span of a nowhere dense set is not necessarily nowhere dense (consider the unit sphere), nor is the sum of two nowhere dense subspaces (for instance, in $C([0,1])$, consider the mean-zero functions and the constants). This came up while thinking about this answer : it isn't sufficient to check weak(-*) convergence in $L^2$ on the subspace $C([0,1])$; a sequence of linear functionals may converge pointwise on $C([0,1])$ but diverge somewhere else.  More generally, when is it sufficient to check weak-* convergence on a dense subspace $A \subset X$?  It is sufficient if $A$ is nonmeager, by a version of the uniform boundedness principle and a triangle inequality argument.  But a subspace which is nonmeager lacks the Baire property, so such an $A$ would be a ""weird"" subspace, something we are not likely to encounter in everyday life.  Most of the examples of dense subspaces I know are either countable dimension (hence meager), or complete in a stronger norm (hence analytic in $X$, hence has the BP, hence meager; as for example $C([0,1]) \subset L^2([0,1])$). So I was wondering whether one could prove that it is never sufficient to check weak-* convergence on a meager subspace.  If my question above has an affirmative answer, then we can do the following: for any meager subspace $E$, write $E = \bigcup_n E_n$ where $E_n$ are increasing nowhere dense subspaces.  Since $E_n$ is nowhere dense, it is not dense, so by Hahn-Banach we may find $f_n \in X^*$ with $f_n(E_n) = 0$ and $\|f_n\| = n$.  Then $f_n(x) \to 0$ for every $x \in E$, but $\{f_n\}$ is unbounded so (by the uniform boundedness principle) it is not weak-* convergent.  Thus it would not suffice to check weak-* convergence on $E$.","['descriptive-set-theory', 'baire-category', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

I would like to: Find the norm of $T_t$. Determine whether $T_t$ converges to an operator in the weak, strong, or uniform topologies, as $t \to \infty$. This is a homework problem, so I would appreciate suggestions and hints only. I have used this previous post, Convergence of translation operator , to help me answer this question when we consider $T_t$ as an operator $L^2(\mathbb{R}, dx) \to L^2(\mathbb{R}, dx)$. In this situation, $||T_t|| = 1$ and $T_t$ just converges weakly. But now I am finding the modified problem considerably harder.

Is there some clever way to rewrite $$\int_{\mathbb{R}}|f(x + t)|^2 e^{-x^2} dx$$ in terms of just $\int_{\mathbb{R}}|f(x)|^2 e^{-x^2} dx$?

554920,Examples of a problem solved by a well-chosen derivative equaling zero,"What are examples of problems which are solved by taking a derivative of a well-chosen function, and finding that it is zero, therefore the function must be constant? I can think of a few: Show $\int_0^pf(t)dt = \int_a^{a+p}f(t)dt$ for $f$ periodic of period $p$. This can be solved by differentiating $\int_0^pf(t)dt - \int_a^{a+p}f(t)dt$ with respect to $a$, noting that it is zero, and noting that the function has value zero at $a=0$. Show that $\int_1^a \frac1t dt = \int_b^ab \frac1t dt$. This can be shown by differentiating $\int_1^a \frac1t dt - \int_b^ab \frac1t dt$ with respect to $b$, noting that it is zero, and noting that the function is zero ab $b=1$. A bounded harmonic function on $\mathbb{R}^n$ must be constant, since we can show by mean value property that $|\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}| \leq C/r \cdot \max_{\|x\| =r}|u|$ for any $r$, so sending $r$ to infinity shows $u$ is a constant. I note that both of these first two problems are similar in that what is of interest is in the limits of an integral. I was looking for some other examples, perhaps not sharing this similarity.

555180,Explain why the Hamming distance satisfies the triangle inequality,"The Hamming distance satisfies the triangle inequality that is for all $x,y,u$ in $c$ such that $d(x,y) \le d(x,u) + d(u,y)$ where $c$ is a code.

So turning $x$ to $t$ will change no more than $d(x,u) + d(u,y)$ letters. By looking at the following example, $x = 001111, \ y = 111111, \ z = 011111$, the equality holds when changing $x$ to $y$, $z$ is just an intermediate step.

555283,Determining the properties for the relation over $P(\mathbb{N})$ where $ARB \iff A \cup B \in H$,"I had two problems with this exercise: I don't know the universe for doing $\overline{A}$ (I'll show below). I couldn't show that it was transitive, although I'm fairly sure it is. Can you assist me there? For $A \in P(\mathbb{N})$, we say that $A \in H \iff \overline{A}$ is
  finite. Over $P(\mathbb{N})$ is defined the relation $R$: $$ARB \iff A \cup B \in H$$ Determine its properties. First of all, the beginning statement says that for a part X of $\mathbb{N}$: $X \in H \implies \overline{X}$ is finite $\overline{X}$ is finite $\implies X \in H$ Question : When it says $\overline{A}$, I need to know the universe we're working on, right? Is the universe $\mathbb{N}$? Or $P(\mathbb{N})$? Or $\mathbb{R}$? For this exercise I will assume that it refers to $\mathbb{N}$. Reflexive No. Have a set $A$ in $P(\mathbb{N})$ where $A = \{1,2,3\}$. Note that $\overline{A}$ would be infinite, given that the universe is $\mathbb{N}$. Since $\overline{A}$ is infinite, $A \not \in H$, according to the premise we're given. $A \cup A = A$, and we know that $A \not \in H$. Therefore the relation is not reflexive. Symmetric Yes. We want to prove that $ARB \implies BRA$ for $A,B \in P(\mathbb{N})$. Have $$ARB$$ $$A \cup B \in H$$ Since $\cup$ is commutative, it is equivalent to $$B \cup A \in H$$ Hence, the relation is symmetric. Antisymmetric No. Have sets $A,B \in P(\mathbb{N})$, where $A = \mathbb{N}$ and $B = \{1,2,3\}$. Since $\overline{A} = \emptyset$, $\overline{A}$ is finite. According to the premise, this means that $A \in H$. Therefore: $$A \cup B \in H$$ So $ARB$. And then: $$B \cup A \in H$$ So $BRA$. However: $$A \not = B$$ So the relation isn't antisymmetric. Transitive Yes. Have $A,B,C \in P(\mathbb{N})$ where $ARB \land BRC$. $$ARB \land BRC$$ $$(A \in H \lor B \in H) \land (B \in H \lor C \in H)$$ $$(B \in H) \lor (A \in H \land C \in H)$$ $$B \in H \lor A \in H \lor C \in H$$ If I could show that $B \not \in H$ I would be done. But how? Total No. Have sets $A,B \in P(\mathbb{N})$ where $A = \{1,2,3\}$ and $B = \{4,5,6\}$ From our reflexive proof, we know that $A \not \in H$. The same logic can be applied to $B$. Since neither are in $H$, we have that $$A \cup B \not \in H$$ And of course, $$B \cup A \not \in H$$ Thus, $$A\not R B \land B \not R A$$ So the relation isn't total.","['relations', 'discrete-mathematics', 'elementary-set-theory']"

$$

Each term in this product is bounded in the interval $(0,1)$, so $f(n)$ will tend to $0$ for large $n$.

f(n) \ge \frac{c}{n^{a \log n}} \,,

so that the product decays only subexponentially slowly, but a heuristic argument as well as numerics indicates that the true scaling is actually a much slower inverse polynomial. The heuristic argument is, roughly, that the terms in the product are highly correlated, and if one term is small, the following term must be large.

555650,"Is it true that if $X$ is connected, then for every nonempty proper subset $A$ of $X$, we have $\mathbf{Bd} \ne \emptyset$ [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : $X$ is connected iff $\forall A\subset X,$ $\partial A\neq\emptyset$ (3 answers) Closed 4 years ago . Is it true that if $X$ is connected, then for every nonempty proper subset $A$ of $X$, we have $\mathbf{Bd} \ne \emptyset$? Does the converse hold? I start by trying to understand what $\mathbf{Bd}$ means in ""formal terms"" (i.e. $\bar{A} \cap \overline{X-A}$ is the 'boundary' of $A \in X$)? This means I'm supposed to figure out if the boundary of subset of a connected space is empty or not, right? I think that if a set is connected then it contains no partition into two sets, so there would exist points that are both in $A$ and in the complement of $A$ in $X$. This would be an informal definition of a boundary. (A boundary contains points in a set $A$ and points outside of it, right?) What I mean is, if $X$ is connected, and $A \subset X$ is connected, then $A$ could have a boundary which means that technically, $X$ cannot be partitioned into $A$ and $A$-complement without making the boundary of $A$ an empty set.

555688,Are critical points fixed?,"Let $M$ be a smooth manifold (compact, connected, without boundary and oriented if you wish) with a smooth action of $S^1$. Let $f:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be an invariant function $f$. I know how to prove that a fixed point of the action is a critical point of $f$. What I don't know is if the converse is true: I can prove that if a point is critical, then all the points in its orbit are critical as well, but that's all. So the questions are: 1) Are the critical points of $f$ necessarily fixed? 2) If the answer to 1) is ""yes"": any hint on the proof? 3) If the answer to 1) is ""no"": any counterexample? Is there any extra condition that makes the answer of 1) to be ""yes""?",['differential-geometry']

555712,On finding polynomials that approximate a function and its derivative (extensions of Stone-Weierstrass?),"The Stone-Weierstrass Theorem tells us that we can approximate any continuous $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ arbitrary well on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by some polynomial. Suppose that $f$ is continuously differentiable, under what conditions can we guarantee we can find a polynomial $p$ such that $p$ approximates arbitrarily well $f$ and the partial derivatives approximate of $p$ arbitrarily well those of $f$ (on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$)? References are welcome. See below for my (probably naive) approach to the question. It is straightforward to find conditions if $n=1$: Let $K:=[a,b]\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ and let $K_+$ denote some open cover of $K$. Suppose that $f:K_+\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuously differentiable and let $f'$ denote its derivative. Then, by Weierstrass's approximation Theorem we have that there exists a polynomial $q$ such that $$||f'(x)-q(x)||\leq \varepsilon$$ for all $x\in K$. Choose some $y\in K$. For any $x\in K$ define $$p(x):=f(y)+\int_y^xq(t)dt.\quad\quad(*)$$ By the Fundamental Theorem of calculus we have that $p'=q$. So for any $x\in K$ $$||f(x)-p(x)||=\left|\left|\int_y^x (f'(t)-q(t))dt\right|\right|\leq \int_y^x ||f'(t)-q(t)||dt\leq \varepsilon||x-y||\leq \varepsilon (a-b).$$ However, the above argument doesn't work in higher dimensions because the analogue of $(*)$ does not imply that $\nabla p = q$ (since not every vector of polynomials spans a gradient field). Can anyone suggest a way around this? That is, a way to to show that for continuously differentiable $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ and for any $\varepsilon>0$, we can always find a polynomial $p$ such that $$||f(x)-p(x)||+||\nabla f(x)-\nabla p(x)||\leq \varepsilon$$ for all $x$ in some compact set $K$?

555763,Different profinite topologies on a group?,"I have some general questions around the profinite topology on a group $G$. On the page http://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Profinite_topology one can read, that The profinite topology on a group is a topology on the underlying set of the group defined in the following equivalent ways: It has as a basis of open subsets all left cosets of subgroups of finite index. It has as a basis of open subsets all right cosets of subgroups of finite index. It has as a basis of open subsets all cosets of normal subgroups of finite index. Under the profinite topology, any group becomes a topological group. I always hear, that there is ONE profinite topology on a group. But every set of subgroups of finite index, which is closed under taking intersections gives us a ""profinite"" topology for a  group. But then maybe some elements of the above basiselements aren't open sets in this topology. So are these topologies also called profinite, although they aren't the above defined one? If we have a profinite group. How is the connection between the ""profinite topology"" and the definition of a profinite group.
If we got a ""profinite"" topology on $G$. What about the profinite completion $G'$. How can I find a basis of open subsets in $G'$. How is the connection between a basis of $G$ and a basis of $G'$? Thanks for help.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'topological-groups', 'group-theory']"
