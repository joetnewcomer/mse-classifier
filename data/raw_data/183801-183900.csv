3369178,Units of the rate of change of the area with respect to a linear measure,"Suppose we have: Find the instantaneous rate of change of the area of a square with respect to its side when the side is $2\,\textrm{cm}$ . Solution . 
Let $a$ be the side of the square. Then $A=a^2$ is the respective area and $$
\dfrac{\textrm{d}A}{\textrm{d}a} = \dfrac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}a}(a^2) = 2a.
$$ Finally, $$
\left.\dfrac{\textrm{d}A}{\textrm{d}a}\right|_{a=2} = 4.
$$ Now, the question: Is it $4\,\textrm{cm}$ ? I mean the units :) Or it would be better to say $\textrm{cm}^2/\textrm{cm}$ ? The later is the same as $\textrm{cm}$ , but since we are asking about the rate of change in the area, maybe we should keep it as $\textrm{cm}^2/\textrm{cm}$ ?","['area', 'derivatives', 'unit-of-measure']"

Show that $2^t$ cannot be written in $n_{u,m}$ $$n_{u,m} = \sum_{i=0}^{u}(n+i)^m \ne 2^t \ \ \ \ \ \forall n,u,m,t\in \mathbb{N}$$ Generalization of above problem Let $d$ be any odd positive integer then show that $$\sum_{q=0}^{u}(n+qd)^{m}\ne 2^t \ \ \ \ \forall n,u,m,t\in\mathbb{N}$$ I proved for $n_{u,1}$ and $n_{u,2}$ never equals a power of two. Proof for $n_{u,1}\ne 2^t$ Proof Let suppose $$n_{u,1} = n+(n+1)+...+(n+u)$$ $$=\frac{(u+1)(2n+u)}{2}= 2^t$$ So $$ (u+1)(2n+u)= 2^{t+1}$$ Case $1$ : $u$ is $odd$ Then $u+1= even$ and $2n+u = odd$ it implies $ even×odd \ne 2^{t+1}$ because $  2^{t+1}$ content only $even$ multiples except $1$ and $2n+u>1$ . Case $2$ : $u$ is $even$ Then $u+1= odd$ and $2n+u = even$ it implies $odd×even \ne 2^{t+1}$ similarly as case1 So both cases shows complete proof for $n_{u,1} \ne 2^t$ Note By using Newton's interpolation method, we can calculate formula for $n_{u,m}$ . I write the general formula at bottom of the post. So $$ n_{u,2}=n^2(u+1)+(2n+1)\frac{(u+1)u}{2} +\frac{(u+1)u(u-1)}{3} \  \ \ \ \  \  ...eq(1)$$ Proof for $n_{u,2}\ne 2^t$ Proof Let suppose $n_{u,2} = 2^t$ We can write $eq(1)$ as $$ (u+1)(6n^2+3(2n+1)u+2u(u-1))= 3×2^{t+1} \ \ \  \ ...eq(2)$$ Case $1$ : $u =even$ $\implies u+1 = odd$ $\implies u+1=3$ $\ \ \ $ By $eq(2)$ $\implies 3n^2+3(2n+1)+2=2^{t}=even$ But we know, if $n$ is $even$ then $3n^2+3(2n+1)+2\ne even$ and if $n$ is $odd$ then $3n^2+3(2n+1)+2\ne even$ Hence it implies $3n^2+3(2n+1)+2\ne2^{t}$ Case $2$ : $u =odd$ $\implies u+1=even=2^x$ for some $x$ . $\implies 6n^2+3(2n+1)u+2u(u-1)= even=3×2^y$ for some $y$ . Where $2^x2^y=2^{t+1}$ $\implies 2n+1= even$ , which is not true. Hence both cases shows complete proof for $n_{u,2}\ne 2^t$ General formula for $n_{u,m}$ $$n_{u,m}=\sum_{i=0}^{m} \binom{u+1}{i+1} \sum_{j=i}^{m}\binom{m}{j}n^{m-j}\sum_{k=0}^{i}(i-k)^j(-1)^k\binom{i}k $$ Where $n\in \mathbb{R}$ and $u,m\in \mathbb{Z^*}$ and $0^0=1$ Moreover if we put $n=0$ then $$0_{u,m}=\sum_{l=0}^{u}l^{m}$$ $$=\sum_{i=0}^{m}\binom{u+1}{i+1}\sum_{k=0}^{i}(i-k)^i(-1)^k\binom{i}k $$ Edit: $$\sum_{q=0}^{u}(n+qd)^{m}=\sum_{i=0}^{m} \binom{u+1}{i+1}\sum_{j=i}^{m}\binom{m}{j}n^{m-j}d^j\sum_{k=0}^{i}(i-k)^j(-1)^k\binom{i}k $$ Proof Yes, It is a bit complicated but I believe it is true.

I've got a function $u:\Omega \to \Omega$ that is nonholomorphic, but real-analytic as a function of the real and imaginary parts of its argument; e.g. something like $u(\mathbf{z})= \overline{z_1\!} \, \mathbf{z}$ , where $\mathbf{z} = (z_1,z_2)$ . Is there any literature that specifies conditions on such $u$ so that $f\circ u$ is plurisubharmonic?

3370010,Can this heuristic argument be useful to prove: Sum of digits of $a^b$ equals $ab$ conjecture?,"I've been trying to write a proof for the following conjecture (from this question): Let $s\left(a^{b}\right)$ denote the sum of the digits of $a^{b}$ in base $10$ . Then the only integer values $a$ , $b>1$ that satisfy $s\left(a^{b}\right)=ab$ are $(2,2),(3,3),(3,6),(3,9)$ and $(3,27)$ . I found what I think is a heuristic argument, but i'm not sure if it can be useful in proving the conjecture. Let $d\left(n\right)$ denote the number of digits of integer $n$ in base $10$ : $$d\left(n\right)=1+\left\lfloor \log_{10}n\right\rfloor $$ Let $s\left(n\right)$ denote the digit sum of integer $n$ in base $10$ . Now from the conjecture, take for example the case $a=2$ . I've been looking at the following sum: $$\sum_{n=1}^{b}\frac{s\left(2^{n}\right)}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}d\left(2^{k}\right)}$$ The plot of that sum for $1\leq b\leq20000$ looks like that: And now the same plot, with in orange, $9\log b$ : The difference between the $2$ curves quickly converges to a value $c$ , and we see that: $$
\lim_{b\rightarrow\infty}\left(9\log b-\sum_{n=1}^{b}\frac{s\left(2^{n}\right)}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}d\left(2^{k}\right)}\right)=c\approx12.721\ldots
$$ From this, we can also conclude that: $$
\frac{s\left(2^{b}\right)}{\sum_{k=1}^{b}d\left(2^{k}\right)}\sim9\log\left(\frac{b-1}{b}\right)\sim\frac{9}{b}
$$ And since: $$
d\left(n\right)=1+\left\lfloor \log_{10}n\right\rfloor \approx1+\log_{10}n
$$ Then: $$
\sum_{k=1}^{b}d\left(2^{k}\right)\approx\frac{b^{2}\log_{10}2}{2}
$$ And: $$
s\left(2^{b}\right)\sim\left(\frac{9}{b}\right)\left(\frac{b^{2}\log_{10}2}{2}\right)\sim\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)b\log_{10}2s\left(2^{b}\right)\sim1.3546\times b
$$ The same applies to other values of $a$ , so more generally: $$
s\left(a^{b}\right)\sim\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)b\log_{10}a
$$ Looking at plots of $s(a^b)$ for each values of $a$ from $2$ to $8$ , we can see this asymptotic relation seems to be very accurate. Now I have $2$ questions: 1: Does the asymptotic relation above is correct, or is there some errors in my reasoning? 2: Since $a>\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)\log_{10}a$ , does an asymptotic relation like that is enough to prove $s\left(a^{b}\right)<ab$ , for sufficiently large $b$ ?

This function is not so well understood by me. I assume it is analytic for instance. But i have no formal proof. The function grows fast. But I am not sure how fast exactly.
( ofcourse 10 iterations give a good asymptotic and then notice it goes double exponentially fast to its lim ) I have no series expansion , integral representation  , differential equation , continued fraction or such for this.
Nor do I have a way to compute these values in a different way such as different iterations , a koenigs type formula , combinatorical methods , fractals , cellular automatons , a bifurcation point , the area of a filled julia set etc etc. practically there is not a big problem for small imput since it converges rapidly. 
But the values are mysterious to me. In particular is $t(1)$ transcendental ??
Can we even prove it to be irrational ?? Do we have a closed form for $t(1)$ ? [ main question ! ] This all reminds me of the Somos sequences and the Somos constant ( which has a closed form as the derivative of a lerch form ! ) Assuming it is analytic , how does its analytic continuation look like ? Is analytic continuation possible to any complex number or its neighbourhood , or is there a natural boundary ? numerically we have $$t(1) = 35.2850889...$$ Do you recognize this number ?? Is there a closed form ??? Has this been studied before ?? Edit Some remark or motivation : Notice that when you naively try to analyse this , after you know it converges fast you get Set all $x_n = y$ for large $ n $ and some $ y > x > 1.$ $$ y = \frac{y^2 + y^2 + y^2}{y + y + y} $$ So $$ y = 3 y^2 / (3y) $$ $$ y = y^2 / y $$ This is a tautology like $ z = z $ . Useless. It seems all naive methods lead to such tautologies. This is the one of the simplest possible with sum of squares ; rational function iterations of degree $2.$ This only informally suggests the dependance of the starting value $x $ ofcourse. Also there seems no link to iterations that solves equations like Newton iterations. Therefore the recursion fascinates me. Also notice $ t(x) $ is strictly increasing for $ x > 1.$","['convergence-acceleration', 'recursion', 'real-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'closed-form']"

I understand intuitively what the covariant derivative ( $\nabla_pu : TM \rightarrow TM$ ) aims to achieve. It provides a way to transport vectors in one tangent space to another over the manifold. If it is flat it has Christoffel symbol = 0. Now dual to the tangent space is the co-tangent space in which the differntial 1-form $dx : TM \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (for example) lives. (If any of the above definitions are incorrect please let me know) In elementary school calculus we used ""basic differentiation"" to solve all issues in regards to differentiability. Moreover, to find the total derivative in university we used a formula which involves $\partial / \partial x$ notation in conjunction with $dx$ . So they seemed to be doing the same job. The phrase everyone would throw around casually is: ""Use $dx$ when it's a function of one variable and $\partial / \partial x$ when there are multiple"". But at the end of the day they both achieve to specify some sort of ""rate of change"". In differential geometry these are clearly different beasts! I can read a book and ""get"" each definition, but I am struggling to put everything together neatly like jigsaw. Now my questions: In elementary calculus when I ""differentiated"" what did I do? Did I implicitly use a 1-form or the covariant derivative over the Euclidean space in Cart co-ords. If they are the same, why are they same? Since in diff geo on the abstract level they clearly work on different objects. So is integration ONLY concerned in working with 1-forms? (The $dx$ symbol is everywhere) When we solve DEs and PDEs there are derivatives involved. Do these stem from the covariant derivative, or from the differential 1-form? On the abstract level when I say ""I am going to find the derivative"", how do people (versed in differential geometry) interpret that statement? Am I going to be working with 1-forms or with the covariant derivative? Are the ordinary derivatives we see in elementary school calculus (e.g. for performing gradient descent on a surface) covariant, or contra-variant? What implications does this idea have for the entire framework (i.e. I think I heard it is a contravariant object, but we have this thing called a ""covariant derivative"". So do we not use covariant derivative for gradient descent??)

3370692,Angular velocity in Fick Spherical coordinates,"On wikipedia and mathworld it is explained how angular velocity is calculated in spherical coordinates. The coordinate system used there is however not what I am using. In my field, coordinates follow the Fick gimbal. The transforms for this system are: $$\begin{align}
x &= \rho\cos{\phi}\sin{\theta}\\
y &= \rho\sin{\phi}\\
z &= \rho\cos{\phi}\cos{\theta}
\end{align}$$ and the inverses: $$\begin{align}
\rho &= \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\\
\theta &= \tan^{-1} \frac{x}{z}\\
\phi &= \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+z^2}}\\
\end{align}$$ That is, $\theta$ is the azimuthal angle/rotation in the $x$ - $z$ plane, and $\phi$ the elevation/rotation out of the $x$ - $z$ plane. Now, i would like to determine the expression for angular velocity of a point in this coordinate system. I know from secondary sources that the answer is $$
v=\sqrt{\dot\theta^2\cos^2\phi+\phi^2}
$$ but i have trouble arriving at it. I have done the following: I found the following two texts , which explain how to determine the angular derivatives based on the unit vectors of the spherical system, and this answer to another question for how to derive the unit vectors. Following the steps of the latter link to find $\boldsymbol{\hat\rho}$ , $\boldsymbol{\hat\theta}$ , and $\boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}}$ , we take the derivative of the spherical coordinate representation $(\rho\cos{\phi}\sin{\theta}, \rho\sin{\phi}, \rho\cos{\phi}\cos{\theta})$ with respect to $\rho$ , $\theta$ , and $\phi$ , respectively, and then normalize each one. This yields: $$\begin{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{\hat\rho} \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\theta}  \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} \end{bmatrix}  = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\phi\sin\theta & \sin\phi & \cos\phi\cos\theta \\                    \cos\phi\cos\theta & 0 & -\cos\phi\sin\theta \\  -\sin\phi\sin\theta & \cos\phi & -\cos\theta\sin\phi \end{bmatrix}    \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{\hat x} \\ \mathbf{\hat y} \\ \mathbf{\hat z} \end{bmatrix}$$ If i understand correctly, each row is a unit vector here. Then, following here , $$
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{v}&=\frac{d}{dt}\boldsymbol{\rho}\\
&=\boldsymbol{\hat\rho}\cdot\frac{d\rho}{dt}+\rho\cdot\frac{d\boldsymbol{\hat\rho}}{dt}\\
&=\boldsymbol{\hat\rho}\cdot\frac{d\rho}{dt}+\rho\cdot\biggl(\frac{\delta\boldsymbol{\hat\rho}}{\delta \rho}\cdot\frac{d\rho}{dt}+\frac{\delta\boldsymbol{\hat\rho}}{\delta \theta}\cdot\frac{d\theta}{dt}+\frac{\delta\boldsymbol{\hat\rho}}{\delta \phi}\cdot\frac{d\phi}{dt}\biggr)
\end{align}
$$ To solve that equation, we need the partial derivatives of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\rho}}$ with respect to $\rho$ , $\theta$ , and $\phi$ , which are: $$
\begin{align}
\frac{\delta\boldsymbol{\hat\rho}}{\delta\rho} &= 0\\
\frac{\delta\boldsymbol{\hat\rho}}{\delta\theta} &= \cos\phi\cos\theta - \cos\phi\sin\theta\\
 &= \boldsymbol{\hat\theta}\\
\frac{\delta\boldsymbol{\hat\rho}}{\delta\phi} &= - \sin\phi\sin\theta + \cos\phi - \cos\theta\sin\phi \\
 &= \boldsymbol{\hat\phi}
\end{align}
$$ which would make: $$
\boldsymbol{v}=\hat{\boldsymbol{\rho}}\cdot\frac{d\rho}{dt}+\rho\cdot\biggl(\boldsymbol{\hat\theta}\cdot\frac{d\theta}{dt}+\boldsymbol{\hat\phi}\cdot\frac{d\phi}{dt}\biggr)
$$ and thereby $$
v=\sqrt{\dot\theta^2+\dot\phi^2},

My solution: Let $i$ be the second card that is picked, then $i-1$ cards will be less that $i$ and $500 - i$ cards will be greater than $i$ . Thus: P(subsequent card being larger than the previous card) ${\displaystyle =  \sum_{i=1}^{500} \frac {(i -1)(500 - i)}{500 \cdot 499 \cdot 498}}$ I'm not sure if my answer is correct.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"
3370809,What is $\lim_{n\to\infty} \root{2n+1} \of {-1} ?$,"First of all, I'm sorry if this question has been already asked and answered, as far as I searched, I couldn't find such a question on this site. 
So, I've been thinking about the limit of the sequence $\left(\root{2n+1}\of{-1}\right)_{n\geq 0}$ . Since the order of the root is odd for every $n$ , this sequence, is obviously a constant sequence with the general term $a_n = -1$ . So, from this follows that $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \root{2n+1}\of{-1} = -1 $$ .
We can even do an $\epsilon-N$ proof to show this (and it's realy easy actually): $$ \forall \epsilon > 0 \hspace{0.5cm} \exists N \geq 0 \hspace{0.3cm} \text{s.t.} \hspace{0.3cm} \left|\root{2n+1}\of{-1}+1\right|<\epsilon \hspace{0.5cm} \forall n \geq N \\ \left|\root{2n+1}\of{-1} + 1\right| = \left|-1 + 1\right| = 0 < \epsilon \hspace{0.5cm} \forall n \geq 0 \\ N = 0 \ _\blacksquare $$ . However, if we use tehniques ussualy used for solving limits, we end up with a different result: $$ \begin{align*} 
\lim_{n\to\infty} \root{2n+1}\of{-1} &= \lim_{n\to\infty} (-1)^{1\over 2n+1} \\
&= \left(\lim_{n\to\infty}-1\right)^{\lim_{n\to\infty}{1\over 2n+1}} \\ &= (-1)^0 \\ &= 1 \end{align*} $$ . What is wrong here? Why do the two methods give different results? Edit: To make everything clear, I'm assuming the real root as defined by $\root n \of {} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ for odd $n$ and treating this as a real-analysis problem. Also, it's pretty explicit from my question that I'm working with a sequence and not with a function. The limit only goes through natural values of $n$ Edit 2: I've figured it out. Thank you all for your answers esspecially to @Jack who pointed out the theorem I've been using $\lim_{n\to\infty}(a_n^{b_n}) = (\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n)^{(\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n)}$ is not true in general. I've consulted my textbook again and saw that I've missed the part where they said $a_n > 0, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Of course, we can think of this problem also from the viewpoint of functions and the fact that the function $(-1)^x$ is not continuous is another gap in using something like the above theorem. Thank you all again for being so kind and giving me so many answers.","['limits', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

Proof: Recall $PGL(n,\Bbb{R}) \cong GL(n+1, \Bbb{R})/Z$ , where $Z = \{M | M=\alpha I, \alpha \in \Bbb{R}\}$ . Define a homomorphism $ \phi : GL(n+1,\Bbb{R}) \to SL(n+1, \Bbb{R})$ by $\phi (M) = \frac{1}{{\det(M)}^{\frac{1}{n+1}}}M$ (the root is well defined since n+1 is odd). Clearly the image of this map lies in $SL(n+1, \Bbb{R})$ , since $\det(\frac{1}{{det(M)}^{\frac{1}{n+1}}}M) = {(\frac{1}{{\det(M)}^{\frac{1}{n+1}}})}^{n+1}\det(M)=1$ ; in fact it is all of $SL(n+1, \Bbb{R})$ since it acts as the identity on $SL(n+1, \Bbb{R})$ . The kernel of $\phi$ is exactly those matrices where $\frac{1}{{\det(M)}^{\frac{1}{n+1}}}M = I$ , which clearly are matrices in $Z$ ; In fact it is all of $Z$ , because it is easily see that any scalar matrix satisfies this condition.

3371035,Anti-symmetric derivative implies differentiability,"Wikipedia defines Symmetric derivative as a limit $$\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)} {2h}$$ which doesn't imply differentiability. An obvious example is $f(x)=|x|$ or $f=\chi_{\mathbb Q}$ I think a slightly different, unbalanced form of the limit guarantees differentiability. 
Especially the following limit $$\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+2h)-f(a-h)} {3h}=\gamma$$ and the continuity of $f$ at $a$ implies $f'(a)=\gamma$ . My question is, Is the following proof valid? Is it possible to prove an analogous extension with the condition $$\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+ph)-f(x-qh)} {(p+q)h} = \gamma$$ while $p,q$ are different positive real values? (Proof) Define $$G(h)=\begin{cases} 
{\frac{f(a+2h)-f(a-h)} {3h}-\gamma}\quad h\neq 0 \\
0 \quad\quad\quad \quad \quad\quad\quad\quad h=0\\
\end{cases}
$$ and substitute $h$ with $\frac 12 (-\frac 12)^kh = x_k h$ . $$G(x_kh)=\frac{f(a+ (-\frac 12)^kh)-f(a+(-\frac 12)^{k+1}h)} {3x_k h}-\gamma$$ By multiplying $3x_k$ both side and adding up from $k=0$ to $n-1$ , $$3\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{x_k G(x_k h)}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(\frac{f(a+ (-\frac 12)^kh)-f(a+(-\frac 12)^{k+1}h)} h)- (1-(-\frac 12)^n)\gamma
$$ RHS become $$\frac{f(a+h)-f(a-(1/2)^n)} h - (1-(-\frac 12)^n)\gamma\quad \to \quad\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)} h -\gamma$$ by continuity. So we have to show that the left side is zero. Since $|G(x)|<M$ for some $0$ neighborhood, Weierstrass M-test guarantees that $\sum_k ^\infty{x_k G(x_kh)}$ is continuous at $h=0$ and obviously its value is zero.","['proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'derivatives', 'weak-derivatives']"

Note that this is non-trivial since $X$ and $Y$ do not commute and is not simply $e^X(1+\lambda Y+ \lambda^2 Y/2 + \cdots)$ . One way to proceed is perhaps the Zassenhaus formula , which expresses the above quantity as an infinite product of matrix exponentials $$e^{(X+\lambda Y)}= e^{X}~ e^{\lambda Y} ~e^{-\frac{1}{2} \lambda[X,Y]} ~

Show that the number of inflection points of $X$ is $6(g-1)+3d$ (nodes do not count as inflection points). To answer this, I will use three pieces of data: first is the degree formula for singular curves. I should have $g_X=\frac{1}{2}(d-1)(d-2)-r$ . Second, I will use the fact that if we define a map $X \mapsto L$ by $x \mapsto T_x(X) \cap L$ for some $\mathbb{P}^1$ named $L$ (where $L$ is chosen not tangent to X in $\mathbb{P}^2$ ), this morphism has degree $d(d-1)$ . Moreover, this map is ramified if and only if $x$ is an inflection point or $x$ lies on $L$ . Lastly I will use the Hurwitz theorem: given a map $f: X \rightarrow Y$ of curves, $2g_X-2=d_f(2g_Y-2)+deg(R)$ , where $d_f$ is the degree of $f$ and $R$ is the ramification divisor on $X$ . Putting all of this together (i.e. writing down the Hurwitz theorem when $f: X \rightarrow L$ is of degree $d(d-1))$ leaves me with $d^2-3d-2r=-2d(d-1)+deg(R)$ , or $3d^2-5d-2r=deg(R)$ . Subtracting off $d$ from both sides (so as to not count the ramification points where $L$ intersects $X$ ) I get $3d^2-6d-2r$ . This is close to what is written: using the degree-genus formula again I would expect $6(g-1)+3d$ to be equal to $3d^2-6d-6r$ .

For instance, $12366621$ and $666609$ are unholy, while $7777$ and $66166266366$ are holy. Question : Is the set $$\{2^n \ | \ n \in \mathbb N, 2^n \text{ is holy}\}$$ infinite?

I do not feel that I am the first one asking this, and I appreciate it if someone gives me references if applicable. But my thought is the following: Conjecture : No. I will share my reasoning at the end of the post, but let us first see some facts: Smallest unholy instances : $$
\begin{aligned}
2^{157} &= 182687704\color{magenta}{666}362864775460604089535377456991567872\\

\end{aligned}
$$ Then, we witnessed a cluster of unholy powers: $2^{218}, 2^{220}, 2^{222}, 2^{224}, 2^{226}$ , and then kept holy for a while, until we hit the unholy $2^{243}$ . Largest holy instances : I did not throw in a lot of CPU time to pursue holy numbers, nor did I try hard enough to optimize my programs, but among the $3715$ holy powers of $2$ , the largest of them are $$2^{25357}, 2^{25896}, 2^{26051}, 2^{26667}, 2^{29784}.$$ I tested up to around $2^{110000}$ , but that is all I got. It probably will be reasonable for an average computer to test up to say $2^{10^6}$ or $2^{10^7}$ , but I will be surprised to see a new holy number.

We know that $2^n$ has $O(n\ln 2)$ decimal digits, so there are $O(n\ln 2)$ groups of three. For each group there is a $1-10^{-3}$ chance to be not $666$ , so very roughly $$
P(n) = (1-10^{-3})^{n\ln 2} \approx e^{-10^{-3}\ n\ln 2}.
$$ And note that $$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty P(n) \approx \int_{n=0}^\infty e^{-10^{-3}\ x\ln 2} dx < \infty.
$$ The red ""estimation line"" in the figure above follows from this integral. Of course, one can easily argue the properness of the heuristic above: The distribution of the digits close to the left are not uniform; they are  affected by the growth of logarithmic functions. The distribution of the digits close to the right are not uniform; they are affected by the pattern of $2^n \pmod{10^k}$ . $P(n)$ and $P(n+i)$ are not independent, partially because of the awful choice of the number $666$ : $6\cdots 6 \times 2^2 = 26\cdots 64$ .

For example : How do I prove that $(\mathbb{R},d_1)$ is a completeion of $(\mathbb{Q},d_1)$ ?
Here, $d_1$ is the standard Euclidean metric $\underline{\text{My attempt}}$ - I believe we should prove that $\mathbb{Q}$ is subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ is complete. This would mean that all Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{Q}$ converges in $\mathbb{R}$ . However, consider this case - Let $(W,d)$ be an incomplete Metric space and $W \subset Y \subset X$ and $X,Y$ are complete (with same metric). Now, by my argument both $X,Y$ can be the completion of $W$ . Is this   alright? I read somewhere in Stack Exchange that completion is unique(I didn't really understand that answer) $\underline{\text{Approach to resolve this}}$ - We choose the smallest, complete set which contains $W$ as its completion. We can prove that, since $X$ is complete any of it's closed subset is complete. We can also prove that $\overline{W}$ is the smallest closed set that contains $W$ . Hence, $\overline{W}$ is the completion of $W$ (this would explain the notation in the completion proof). Thus in the title - I just have to check if $Y$ is dense in $X$ to prove that $X$ is a completion of $Y$ . This would also solve my example question - We know that $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ is complete. Thus $\mathbb{R}$ is completion of $\mathbb{Q}$ .

The solution goes as follows: Initially, separate the members into two houses in any manner. Let H be the total sum of all enemies each member has in his own house. Now suppose there is a person A who has at least two enemies in his own house. Then he has at most one enemy in the other house, so if A switches houses, H will decrease. Since H is necessarily a non-negative integer, it cannot decrease forever, so at some point this process ends. This means we cannot any longer find a person who has at least two enemies in their own house, which is precisely the assignment requested. What I am not able to understand is that the solution accounts for only one house. What if the person A who was shifted from one house to the other was enemy with some other person in the other house?","['invariance', 'combinatorics']"
3372252,Prove that the tangent of $(ABC)$ at point $F$ passes through the midpoint of $KJ$.,"$AH$ is a altitude of $\triangle ABC$ , $AD$ is the bisector of $\angle CAB$ and $BC$ meets the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ at point $E$ and $(D \in (ABC), H \in BC)$ . Let the intersections between $DE$ , $DH$ and $(ABC)$ are respectively $F$ , $L$ $(L \not\equiv D \not\equiv F)$ . $AF$ and $FL$ cut $BC$ correspondingly at $K$ and $J$ . Prove that the tangent of $(ABC)$ at point $F$ passes through the midpoint of $KJ$ . Let the incenter of $\triangle ABC$ be $I$ and $IM \perp AB, IN \perp AC$ $(M \in AB, N \in AC)$ . We have that $(BF, BM) = (CF, CN) = (DF, DA)$ and $\dfrac{\overline{BF}}{\overline{BM}} = \dfrac{\overline{CF}}{\overline{CN}}$ . (because $FE$ being the bisector of $\angle CFB \implies \dfrac{\overline{CF}}{\overline{FB}} = \dfrac{\overline{CE}}{\overline{EB}}$ alongside $\dfrac{\overline{CE}}{\overline{CN}} = \dfrac{\overline{BF}}{\overline{BM}} = 1$ ). $\implies \triangle FBM \sim \triangle FCN \implies (MF, MA) = (NF, NA) \implies M, F, N, A$ are concyclic. Furthermore, we have that $M, N \in (AI) \implies F \in (AI) \implies FA \perp FI$ . It is evident that $\overline{KF} \cdot \overline{KA} = \overline{KB} \cdot \overline{KC} \implies K$ lies on the radical axis of $(AI)$ and $(CIB)$ . $\implies KI \perp AD$ . However, $KH \perp AH \implies A, I, H, K$ are concyclic. For now, we work backwards. Let $FF' \parallel BC, F \in (ABC)$ , we have that $F(JKMF') = -1 \impliedby F(LAFF') = -1$ But that's all.","['triangles', 'geometry']"

3372364,Advanced Sum: Compute $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{H_{2n}H_n^{(2)}}{(2n+1)^2}$,"How to prove $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{H_{2n}H_n^{(2)}}{(2n+1)^2}=

This problem is proposed by Cornel with no solution submitted. My trial By applying integration by parts we have $$\int_0^1 x^{2n}(\operatorname{Li}_2(x)-\zeta(2))\ dx=-\frac{H_{2n}}{(2n+1)^2}-\frac{1}{(2n+1)^3}$$ now multiply both sides by $H_n^{(2)}$ then sum both sides from $n=1$ to $\infty$ we get $$\int_0^1(\operatorname{Li}_2(x)-\zeta(2))\sum_{n=1}^\infty H_n^{(2)}x^{2n}\ dx=-\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{H_{2n}H_n^{(2)}}{(2n+1)^2}-\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{H_n^{(2)}}{(2n+1)^3}$$ $$\int_0^1\frac{(\operatorname{Li}_2(x)-\zeta(2))\operatorname{Li}_2(x^2)}{1-x^2}\ dx=-\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{H_{2n}H_n^{(2)}}{(2n+1)^2}-\color{blue}{\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{H_n^{(2)}}{(2n+1)^3}}$$ I managed to find the blue sum using Abel's summation. As for the integral, I tried integration by parts but still resistant. QUESTION Any idea how to crack the integral or a different approach to find the target sum?
