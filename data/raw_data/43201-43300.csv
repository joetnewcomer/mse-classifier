428420,Can we *ever* use certain log/exp identities in the complex case?,"This article on Wikipedia points out that certain identities for the log and exponential functions which are familiar from the real case require care when used in the complex case. Failures in the following identities are pointed out $$\log{z^w} \equiv w \log {z}\\(zw)^{\omega}\equiv z^{\omega}w^{\omega}\\e^{zw} \equiv (e^z)^w$$ The article alludes to the fact that the identities do not always work, even if we consider them as an assertion about equalities of sets (and consider the functions as multivalued). Now, how can we work with these identities without leading ourselves into error? Is the answer simply never to employ them in the presence of a complex base or exponent? Occasionally I see uses of these identities; here is one example: Here is a scanned page from Schaum's outline on complex variables which shows how to evaluate $\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{p-1}}{1+x}dx$ with a keyhole contour (for $0<p<1$). As usual, on the return path, we have to parameterize the path as $z = e^{2\pi i}x$, $x\in \mathbb{R}$, rather than simply $z=x$. Now when the author exponentiates this term, he uses $(x e^{2\pi i})^{p-1}=x^{p-1}e^{2\pi i(p-1)}$, employing the second identity above. What justifies this, given that the identity does not hold in general?","['complex-numbers', 'logarithms', 'complex-analysis', 'exponentiation']"
428422,Can we test whether a polynomial only takes non-negative values on the non-negative orthant?,"EDIT: Feel free to replace ""non-negative on the non-negative orthant"" with ""non-negative on a convex set, cone, or any other class of sets that includes the orthant"". A popular way to establish that a polynomial only takes non-negative values, or is non-negative, is to check whether it can be expressed in as a sum of squares. This can be done numerically using some convex program. However, as discussed in here , there are many polynomials which are non-negative but cannot be expressed as a sum of squares. Furthermore, many polynomials which are not non-negative everywhere are non-negative on the non-negative orthant, for example, any odd polynomial with positive coefficients. My questions are (sorry that they overlap a bit): $1$- What is known about polynomials with real coefficients, $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, that satisfy $$x\in\{y\in\mathbb{R}^n:y_i\geq 0\quad\forall i=1,\dots,n\}\Rightarrow f(x)\geq0?$$ $2$- Are there any tractable ways to test whether a given polynomial satisfies the above?

428551,Integrating pressure with respect to time,"I am trying to work through the math derivation presented in a paper about gas flowing through rock due to a pressure differential across the length of rock.  This is my first post so forgive me if I am going about this the wrong way.  My question is about how to perform the math between two steps in the derivation in the paper, but I feel that the steps leading up to the steps in question are necessary since and idea of what the pressures are in relation to the system being evaluated is useful in the math derivation. To begin, the volumetric isothermal flow rate of nitrogen, which behaves as an ideal gas, from a storage tank at pressure $P_0$ is: \begin{equation}
q_o(t)=\frac{M}{\rho_o(t)}\frac{-dn}{dt}=\frac{-MV_t}{\rho_o(t)RT}\frac{dP_o}{dt}  
\end{equation} But density is given by: $$\rho_o(t)=\frac{MP_o(t)}{RT}$$ Therefore, $$q_o(t)=\frac{-V_t}{P_o(t)}\frac{dP_o}{dt}$$ Assume for the moment that at any instant in time the mass velocity throughout the length of the core is constant (this is not rigorously true).  As nitrogen flows through a rock core, it expands, such that $$q(x,t)=\frac{q_o(t)P_o(t)}{p(x,t)}=\frac{-V_t}{p(x,t)}\frac{dP_o}{dt}$$ Klinkenberg's relationship for permeability to gas, expressed as a point function of both time and position, is: $$k(x,t)=k_l\left(1+\frac{b}{p(x,t)+Pa}\right)$$ Darcy's relation for fluid flow in a porous medium in 1D is: $$q = \frac{-kA}{\mu}\frac{dP}{dx}$$ Substituting our volumetric relation and Klinkenberg's relationship into Darcy's equation for one-dimensional flow yields: $$\frac{-V_tP'_o(t)}{p(x,t)}=\frac{-k_lA(1+b/p(x,t))}{\mu}\frac{\partial{p(x,t)}}{\partial{x}}$$ If this equation is integrated with respect to length and divided by $1/2(P_l-P_o)$, it becomes: $$\frac{-2V_t\mu P'_o(t)L}{k_lA(P_o-P_l)}=P_l+P_o+2b$$ Pressures in all equations above have been absolute pressures, expressed in atmospheres and permeability in darcies.  If we now switch to gauge pressure (psig), and express permeability in millidarcies, our equation becomes (since $P_l = 0$ psig): $$\frac{-V_tP'_o(t)}{P_o(t)}=\frac{k_lA}{2000*14.696 \mu L}(P_o(t)+2P_a+2b)$$ set $$m=\frac{k_lA}{29,390 \mu L}$$  and $$i=2(P_a+b)m$$ we have an equation of a straight line with intercept $i$ and slope $m$: $$\frac{-V_tP'_o(t)}{P_o(t)}=i+mP_o(t)$$ Now here is the part that I would like a math explanation.  The paper states that our equation can be rearranged and integrated with respect to time to give: $$\frac{V_t}{i/m} \ln \frac{P_1(P_2+i/m)}{P_2(P_1+i/m)}=m(t_2-t_1)$$ How exactly was this step done?

(However, at this early stage it seems we have no need for contravariant tensors.) In either case, we write it $\bigwedge^k(V)$.

428636,"For $A(t)$ differentiable, taking positive matrices as values, how show $\sqrt{A(t)}$ is differentiable?","On p. 150 of Lax's Linear Algebra , he mentions that is is not hard to show that if $R(t)$ is a differentiable matrix-valued function of a single variable, whose values are positive matrices, then the square root function $\sqrt{R(t)}$, is differentiable as well. I have been trying to prove this without success. The definition Lax gives for the derivative of a matrix valued function is that $$\lim_{h\to 0}\left\|\frac{A(t_0+h) - A(t_0)}{h}- \Omega_{t_0}\right\| = 0 $$ for some matrix $\Omega_{t_0}$, where the double bars denotes the matrix norm.

I have been trying to manipulate the limit $$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\sqrt{A(t_0+h)}-\sqrt{A(t_0)}}{h}$$ In the scalar-valued case, the proof I have seen for the differentiability of the square root function involves rationalizing the numerator by multiplying top and bottom by $\sqrt{x_0+h} + \sqrt{x_0}$. We might try a similar thing with the matrix-valued function, but we would need $\sqrt{A(t_0 + h)}$ to commute with $\sqrt{A(t_0)}$ in order to clear the numerator, and they don't necessarily commute.

Then, for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists some $n_0$ such that $|P(X_n\in A) - P(X\in A)|\leq \varepsilon$ for every $n\geq n_0$; this is obvious, since $P(X_n\in A)=F_{X_n}(x)\rightarrow F_X(x)=P(X\in A)$. We can generalize this a bit, letting $A$ be a finite intersection/union of intervals; now $P(X_n\in A)$ can be expressed as a finite sum of terms of the form $F_{X_n}(x_j)$, and since each one of them converges to $F_X(x_j)$ the result follows applying the triangle inequality.

The Stokes operator $A:D(A)\to H$ is defined by $$\langle Au,v\rangle_{V^\star,V}=\int\nabla u\cdot\nabla v$$ where $D(A)=\{u\in V:\ Au\in H\}$. It is well know that the Stokes operator (see here chapter IV) satisfies all hypothesis of Spectral Theorem for unbounded operators, hence, it possess a sequence of positive (because $A$ is positive) eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ which tends to $\infty$. Therefore it is possible to define $D(A^s)$ for all $s\geq 0$, in fact $$D(A^s)=\{u\in H:\ \sum\lambda_k^{2s}(u,w_k)^2_H<\infty\}$$ where $w_k$ are the eigenfunctions and $A^s u=\sum \lambda_k^s(u,w_k)w_k$.

428653,Prove an analog of Rolle's theorem for several variables,"On p. 135 of Buck's Advanced Calculus , he asks the reader to prove an analog of Rolle's theorem for functions of two variables (I suspect the number two is arbitrary). The hint is to assume that $f=0$ on the boundary of a bounded open set, and I belive what he's looking for is that if $f\in $  $C^1(U)$ for $U$ bounded in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and such that $f=0$ on $\partial U$, then $\exists x_0 \in U$ such that $\mathbf{D}f(x_0)= \mathbf{0}$. This occurs in the section after the introduction of the derivative on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which suggests that methods like Taylor's theorem, etc. are not required. My intuition is to draw lines parallel to each axis and note that by Rolle's theorem in one dimension, there must be a point on each line where $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}=0$, and then somehow argue that there must be a point where all are zero. It seems to me that the points where say $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}=0$ must be something like an $(n-1)$-manifold sitting in $U$, since each line parallel to $e_i$ through $U$ must intersect this set in some point. And same for those points where $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}=0$, but I don't necessarily see why these two hypersurfaces would intersect. I think I am overcomplicating it.

It sounds that it does not ensure that the value of line integral is not completely determined by the image of curve, but equivalent class of parametrization. I am wondering that if there is a theorem that for two $C^1$-parametrizations $X_1:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $X_2:[c,d]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ of some fixed curve which having same orienatation, is there some $C^1$-function $g:[c,d]\rightarrow[a,b]$ such that $X_1 \circ g=X_2$?

Is there another $C^1$ parametrization $X_2(t):[c,d]\rightarrow\mathbb{R^n}$ of $C$ having the same orientation with $X_1(t)$ but $\int_{X_1}F\cdot d\mathbf{s}\ne\int_{X_2}F\cdot d\mathbf{s}$?

The setup is the following: Let $T$ be a random variable on $[0,\infty)$ with survivor function $F(t)=P(T>t)$. Then if $T$ is absolutely continuous with density $f$, then the hazard function $\lambda$ can be defined as 
$$
\lambda(t):=\lim_{h\to 0^+}\frac{P(t\leq T<t+h\mid T\geq t)}{h}=\frac{f(t)}{F(t)}
$$ for $t\geq 0$, and hence we have
$$
F(t)=\exp\left(-\int_0^t\lambda(s)\,\mathrm ds\right),\quad t\geq 0.
$$ if $T$ is discrete taking on the values $0\leq a_1<a_2<\cdots$, then we define the hazard at $a_i$ as
$$
\lambda_i=P(T=a_i\mid T\geq a_i),\quad i=1,2,\ldots.
$$
Then we can show that
$$
F(t)=\prod_{j\mid a_j\leq t}(1-\lambda_j),\quad t\geq 0.
$$ These expressions for the survivor functions I am ok with. Now they write the following: More generally, the distribution of $T$ may have both discrete and continuous components. In this case, the hazard function can be defined to have the continuous component $\lambda_c(t)$ and discrete components $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots$ at the discrete times $a_1<a_2<\cdots$. The overall survivor function can then be written
  $$
F(t)=\exp\left(-\int_0^t\lambda_c(s)\,\mathrm ds\right)\prod_{j\mid a_j\leq t}(1-\lambda_j).\tag{1}
$$ That $T$ has both discrete and continuous components means that the distribution of $T$ is of the form
$$
P_T(\mathrm dx)=f_c(x) \lambda(\mathrm dx)+\sum_{j=1}^\infty b_j \delta_{a_j}(\mathrm dx)

Player $0$ wins the GB-game play $p$ iff for each $i$ $$ B_i \cap \inf(p) \neq \emptyset.$$ Which means that in each of the $B_i$ sets at least one vertex occurs infinitly often in the game. Muller games are more general. The winning condition consists of a set $\mathcal{F_0} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(V)$ and Player $0$ wins a play $p$ iff $$\inf(p) \in \mathcal{F}_0.$$ Muller games closed under superset are Muller games such that $\mathcal{F}_0$ is closed under supersets: $$ X \in \mathcal{F}_0, X \subseteq Y \Rightarrow Y \in \mathcal{F}_0.$$ The taks now is to prove that GB-games and Muller games closed under superset are the same winning conditions. One direction is easy. Just show that $\mathcal{F}_0 := \{X \subset V \mid \forall 1 \leq i \leq k, X \cap B_i \neq \emptyset\}$ is closed under supersets.

They say that vector $F^n$ always has N components but coordinates depend on chosen basis and, therefore, it is meaningless to talk about coordinates when basis is unspecified. But don't components depend on basis? Why can you talk about components regardless of the basis? Do they just demonstrate their domination by being too picky and making the difference between the things, which are the same, and, thus, causing confusion? Later they mock my definition of vector space, where I say that it is a collection of vectors. They say that it is wrong since vector space an Abelian group whose elements can be scaled. But, I see no difference between these definitions. edit If this answer and Wikipedia are correct then $\psi_i = \langle \psi|i\rangle$ in $$\vec \psi = \begin{bmatrix}|1\rangle |2\rangle \cdots |n\rangle\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \\ \vdots \\ \psi_n \end{bmatrix}$$ must be coordinates in the basis $\begin{bmatrix}|1\rangle |2\rangle \cdots |n\rangle\end{bmatrix}$, which I believe is different from the standard basis.

  in. Eq. (7.7) is
  $$\sum_k u_k \vec e_k = \sum_i v_i \sum_k f_{ki} \vec e_k$$ Actually, I was motivated to ask this question when tried to represent these equations, which involve integration, in vector form and do not understand why everybody calls the coefficients $u_k$ in $\sum u_k \vec e_k$ components rather than coordinates. It seems to me that matematicians use these terms interchangably and troll the noobs with immaterial difference.

429402,Bounding the Modified Hausdorff Distance,"I'm doing a summer research project on model validation metrics for applications in oil spill modeling.  The idea is to change a single variable in a model one at a time until a certain ""metric"" is minimized between the model and the observation.  Repeating the process for all relevant variables results in a strong approximation of the observed data.  There's no standard yet since the modelling technique is new, and hopefully significantly improves over the older HYCOM models.  My role is to develop and compare metrics that are sufficiently accurate for our needs. Currently, I've had good success with the so-called Modified Hausdorff Distance as given by Dubuisson and Jain ( http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=576361&tag=1 ): \begin{equation*}
d_{MH}(A,B) = \max\left\{\frac{1}{|A|}\sum_{a\in A}d(a,B), \frac{1}{|B|}\sum_{b\in B}d(b,A)\right\},
\end{equation*} where $A,B\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $|A|,|B|<\infty$ .  Also, $d(a,B)=\min_{b\in B}\|a-b\|$ , and similarly for $d(b,A)$ . The metric has performed very well in various tests, showing the desired monotonicity with respect to various standard homotopies (translation, scaling, noise).  Additionally, it scored quite well on a facial recognition test I ran using grayscale images from the AT $\&$ T Database of Faces ( http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html ). The problem, as stated by the authors, is that the function isn't a topological metric on the space of all finite subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ since it fails the triangle inequality.  For the pursposes of our applications, this doesn't seem to be a huge problem since it's done so well in practice.  However, I'd like to at least develop some bounds on this bad behavior.  Namely, I'm stuck on two things: (1)   I need a good counterexample to the triangle inequality.  Any ideas?  I've had trouble coming up with one, and the authors don't cite any. (2)   My intuition tells me the counterexample(s) will involve sets with small numbers of points, and if this is the case I'd like to see if I can develop an approximation of the form $d(A,C)\leq d(A,B)+d(B,C)+\epsilon(n)$ , where $n=\max(|A|,|B|)$ and $\epsilon:\mathbb{Z}^+\to\mathbb{R}$ monotonically decreases.  Thus for large sample sizes, $d_{MH}$ is essentially a true topological metric. Any suggestions on how to proceed?  I'm a bit stuck.. any suggestions would be very helpful. Jon EDIT 1 : After further testing, it turns out the suggested value of $K=3/2$ is too small.  I've yet to achieve values of $K>3/2$ in MATLAB simulations in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\in\{2,3,4\}$ , however values around $K=3$ are required for $n\not\in \{2,3\}$ . The above plot shows one such simulation.  For each $k=1,...,10$ , I plotted random sets of points $A,B,C\subset\mathbb{R}^k$ and computed $d_{MH}(A,B),d_{MH}(B,C)$ , and $d_{MH}(A,C)$ $10^5$ times.  I then found the maximum value of $K$ to force the proposed inquality to hold.  The $x$ -axis indicates the dimension, and the $y$ -axis indicates the $K$ values.  I'm not quite sure what to make of this yet.  I think it's clear that if such a bounding of the Modified Hausdorff Distance exists, it must be a multiplicative one.  Based on significant empirical evidence, I find it doubtful the function is unbounded.  The behavior on $\mathbb{R}^k$ for $k=1,2,3$ makes sense, but why the increasing behavior for higher dimensions?? EDIT 2 : As requested, here's an example in $\mathbb{R}$ that forces $K>2$ : \begin{align*}
A &= \{4,11\}\\
B &= \{2,13,14,18,20,26,61\}\\
C &= \{5,53,58,65,79,81\}.
\end{align*} Then $d_{MH}(A,B)=12.5714,d_{MH}(B,C)=10.2857,$ and $d_{MH}(A,C)=47$ .  Thus the smallest $K\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $d_{MH}(A,C)\leq K(d_{MH}(A,B)+d_{MH}(B,C))$ is $K=2.0563$ . The plot isn't terribly illuminating, but I'll include it as requested: Edit 3: The following bounds have been disproved: \begin{align*}
1.& d_{MH}(A,C)\leq d_{MH}(A,B)+d_{MH}(B,C)+\epsilon;\\
2.& d_{MH}(A,C)\leq K(d_{MH}(A,B)+d_{MH}(B,C));\\
3.& d_{MH}(A,C)\leq K\cdot\max\{d_{MH}(A,B),d_{MH}(B,C)\}. 
\end{align*} Counterexamples to 1 and 2 can be found below.  For 3, choose $A,B,C$ as in (6).  Then, letting $\delta$ denote the minimal distance from a point in $N_{n,r}$ to $N$ for $N\in\{1,2\}$ , we have: \begin{equation*}
d(A,C)\leq\frac{n}{n+1}(n\delta+1), ~~~ d(A,B)\geq\frac{n\delta+1}{n+1},~~~ d(B,C)\geq \delta.
\end{equation*} Hence \begin{align*}
d(A,C)\leq K\cdot\max\{d(A,B),d(B,C)\} &\Leftrightarrow K\geq\frac{d(A,C)}{\max\{d(A,B),d(B,C)\}}\\
&\Leftrightarrow K\geq \frac{1+r}{1/n+\delta}\rightarrow \infty

Question 1) Let $(\Omega, 2^{\Omega},P)$ be a probability space such that $\Omega$ has a finite number of elements, and let $P(\omega)>0, \forall \omega \in \Omega$. Let $Q$ be a probability measure, equivalent to $P$. Prove that there is a random variable $Z$ s.t. $Q(F)=E^{P}(1_{F}(\omega)Z), \forall F\in 2^{\Omega}$ Now it turns out that this random variable $Z$, denoted as $Z=\frac{dQ}{dP}$ is called the Radon-Nikodym derivative . Question 2) Prove that this random variable is nonnegative and has expectation 1 w.r.t. the probability measure $P$. Hint (to prove that this R.V. is non-negative almost sure): you could use $(-\infty,0)=\cup_{n \geq1, n \in \mathbb{N}}(-\infty,-\frac{1}{n}) $ My attempts: Q1] $E^{P}(1_{F}Z)=\sum_{\omega \in \Omega}1_{F}(\omega)Z(\omega)P(\omega)=\sum_{\omega \in F}Z(\omega)P(\omega)=Q(F)=\sum_{\omega \in F}Q(\omega)$. Hence $Z(\omega)=\frac{Q(\omega)}{P(\omega)}, \forall \omega \in F$, $\forall F \in 2^{\Omega}$. is a random variable s.t. $Q(F)=E^{P}(1_{F}(\omega)Z), \forall F\in 2^{\Omega}$. Q2] I think I am able to prove that this random variable $Z$ has expectation 1. I would do this is follows, however I am not sure!
$E^{P}(Z)=E^{P}\frac{Q(\omega)}{P(\omega)}=\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} P(\omega)\frac{Q(\omega)}{P(\omega)} = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega}Q(\omega)=1 $ So actually my biggest problem is to prove that this random variable $Z$ is nonnegative almost sure. I really did think about it, but can't come up with a reasonable answer where I also use the given hint. I Hope you are willing to help me with this, since I have shown now that I did think about these questions. However, I'm really stuck with this last problem, that $Z$ is nonnegative almost sure. Yes indeed, $Q(\omega)$ and $P(\omega)$ are bigger than zero by definition and therefore the ratio is bigger than zero. But My problem still is that I did not use the hint which is given which feels wrong to me. Also, I think that $\frac{Q(\omega)}{P(\omega)}$ is just an example of such a $Z$. So in that case, I've proven only for this special case that the sign is positive almost sure and that it's expectation is one. Or am I wrong with this? Thanx in advance!",['probability-theory']

This just led to a big mess, though, eventually reaching that $$\mid\mid T(\cos\theta,\sin \theta)\mid\mid^2 < a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+2(ab+cd)$$ This is kind of similar to $u$ and $v$ but not quite good enough, so I'm not sure now if this approach with $\theta$ and the trig functions is the right one. I also don't know how to get started for the other inequality.","['matrices', 'normed-spaces', 'linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis']"
429496,"If $A$ is skew-symmetric, its determinant remains unchanged when the same number is added to all its entries","If we have a skew-symmetric matrix, $A^t = -A$, of size $2n\times 2n$ and we add the same number to every entry in the matrix and take the determinant, i'm told we get the same determinant as $\det A$. A couple of small examples have confirmed this to be true for me, but I can't fully see why. By making use of the multilinearity of the determinant function we get that the new determinat is equal to $\det A$ + the determinants of $2n$ matrices, each a permutation of the original matrix with one row swapped with a  row of the added constant. I can't see the symmetry as to why these all cancel to 0.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"
429498,A differential form to compute the k-volume of a k-parallelogram in n dimensions,"Computing the k-volume of a k-parallelogram (i.e. a parallelogram spanned by k n-dimensional vectors) in n dimensions is straightforward: Let $P=[\overrightarrow{v_1},...,\overrightarrow{v_k}]$, then the k-volume is equal to $\sqrt{det(P^{T}P)}$. For instance, if n=3 and k=2, then this formula reduces to the norm of the cross-product and thus gives the 2-volume (area) of the parallelogram spanned by two 3-D vectors. Now this fact is very useful when trying to find the k-volumes of manifolds (e.g. areas of 2-D surfaces in 3-D) by integration. My question is, is there differential form or a form field that would serve the same purpose? In $\mathbb{R}^3$ for instance, the elementary 2-forms give you the signed area of the ""projection"" of the 2-parallelogram onto (x,y) or (x,z) or (y,z) planes depending on the form you use, but not the area of 2-parallelogram living in the space.","['multivariable-calculus', 'differential-forms', 'linear-algebra']"

The equation is $xy \, dy = (3y^2+2x^2) \, dx$, $M_y = 6y$ and $N_x = y$, they aren't equal so this equation is nowhere near exact, it doesn't look like I can do separable either?

429567,Do I understand metric tensor correctly?,"So I've been studying vectors and tensors, and I'm trying to understand metric tensors. As I understand them, besides a vast array of explanations, they provide an invariant distance between vectors regardless of whether their basis has changed. So if you had a set of vectors in say a Cartesian coordinate space, using a metric tensor to describe the distances between the vectors even if the primed basis describes them in Spherical coordinates, are he same distances? This isn't becoming quite intuitive to me yet. This equation might clarify where I understand the definition of a metric tensor: $ds^2= g_{11} dx^2 + g_{22} dy^2$","['vector-spaces', 'tensors', 'differential-geometry']"
