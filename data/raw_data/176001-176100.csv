3154887,Walter Rudin's mathematical analysis: theorem 2.43. Why proof can't work under the perfect set is uncountable.,"I found several discussions about this theorem, like this one . I understand the proof adopts contradiction by assuming the perfect set $P$ is countable. My question is if the assumption is $P$ is uncountable, the proof seems remains the same, i.e., the $P$ can't be uncountable either. In other words, I think whatever the assumption is, we can draw the contradiction in any way. I don't understand in which way the uncountable condition could solve the contradiction in the proof.","['analysis', 'real-analysis']"
3155001,"A function being ""finite"" over a point on non-normal schemes?","I recently came across a remark about Cartier divisors in a textbook on algebraic geometry. I'm not sure how to interpret the remark. I've attached the previous paragraph as well for context. The phrasing I am confused about is ""thus the function $f$ may be finite over a point"". What exactly is meant by this, and why does it follow from the previous sentence about $f$ being integral? Does this mean finite as a morphism of schemes? A morphism to where though, the spectrum of the residue field? For reference, this is from page 139 of Mumford & Oda. A draft electronic copy is available here (on Mumford's web page) in which the remark appears on page 109.","['divisors-algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'sheaf-theory']"
3155024,Side length of a quadrilateral incribed on a circle,"I've been doing math for 10 years now, yet every so often I get stumped by a ""basic"" high school question. This is one of those times. Here's the question: Part a is easy; we apply the cosine rule to the angle $92^\circ$ . I don't understand how to use the sine rule to find $CD$ . I managed to find it using the cosine rule; draw a line between $BD$ and use this as the ""main"" length in the cosine rule. The other two lengths are $5cm$ and $CD$ . You end up with a quadratic involving $CD$ that can be solved. But I don't understand how to use the sine rule to do this. Ideas anyone?","['quadrilateral', 'trigonometry', 'circles', 'geometry']"
3155070,Deforming a linear map a little preserves surjectivity,"Let $X$ be a Banach space, and $A: X\to X$ be a surjective linear map. Define $$\eta(A) = \{\lambda\in \mathbb{C}: A - \lambda I \text{ is surjective}\}$$ where $I: X\to X$ is the identity. Show that $\eta(A)$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{C}$ . This is a problem from a graduate qualifying exam and I'm a bit stuck on it—it suffices to show that a neighborhood of $0$ in $\mathbb{C}$ is contained in $\eta(A)$ . My initial idea was something like ""given $Ax \in X$ , consider $y\in A^{-1}(Ax + \lambda x)$ . This $y$ should under $A - \lambda I$ map to someone close to $Ax$ , if $\lambda$ is small. Then we use the difference between $Ay - \lambda y$ and $Ax$ to adjust $y$ . We repeat and hope we get convergence"". And that's about all I've got so far, but it requires the open mapping theorem, which requires $A$ to be continuous. Can the problem even be done without the continuity of $A$ ? Any help is appreciated, regarding whether the problem is possible without the continuity of $A$ and how actually to prove the result.

3155091,Q: Help to understand simple probability problem from Kahneman 'Thinking fast and slow',"I'm new to statistics and I'm trying to solve this easy problem. Unfortunately I can't find a solution that would confirm that scenario with 4 same coloured marbles is six times more likely than the other one. Here's the problem from Kahneman's book: Imagine a large urn filled with marbles. Half the marbles are
  red, half are white. Next, imagine a very patient person (or a robot)
  who blindly draws 4 marbles from the urn, records the number of red
  balls in the sample, throws the balls back into the urn, and then does
  it all again, many times. If you summarize the results, you will find
  that the outcome “2 red, 2 white” occurs (almost exactly) 6 times as
  often as the outcome “4 red” or “4 white.” My solution (I assumed that there are 10k marbles in total): probability of drawing 4 marbles with same colour: 5000/10000 * 4999/9999 * 4998/9998 * 4997/9997 = 6,25% there are two combinations (rrrr, wwww), so: 6,25% * 2 = 12,49% probability of drawing 2 marbles of each colour: 5000/10000 * 4999/9999 * 5000/9998 * 4999/9997 = 6,25% here we have six combinations (wwrr, rrww, wrrw, rwwr, rwrw, wrwr): 6,25% * 6 = 37,51%","['statistics', 'probability']"

Then we have that $$
a\in gSg^{-1} \implies a = gs_{1}g^{-1}\ \textrm{for some}\ s_1\in S \\
b\in gSg^{-1} \implies b = gs_{2}g^{-1}\ \textrm{for some}\ s_2\in S
$$ Proceeding with the subgroup test: \begin{align}
ab^{-1} &= \left(g s_1 g^{-1}\right)\left(g s_2 g^{-1}\right)^{-1} \\
&= g s_1 g^{-1} g {s_2}^{-1} g^{-1} \\
&= gs_1{s_2}^{-1}g^{-1} \\
&\in gSg^{-1}
\end{align} So $c(S)\leq G$ . I'm struggling in particular with showing that $c(S)$ is normal in $G$ . I have so far attempted to show that $c(S)$ is closed under conjugation by elements from $G$ : Let $b\in c(S)$ . If $gbg^{-1}\in c(S)$ for all $g\in G$ , then $c(S)\triangleleft G$ : \begin{align}
b\in c(S) &\implies b = gsg^{-1}\ \textrm{for some}\ s\in S\textrm{, for all}\ g\in G. \\
&\implies gbg^{-1} = ggsg^{-1}g^{-1} = (gg)s(gg)^{-1}
\end{align} I'm not sure how to proceed from this point. I am also confused at the definition of $c(S)$ itself, I definitely do not have any intuition as to what the object $c(S)$ actually is. Edit (In response to Chrystomath's comment) : Let $b\in c(S)$ . Then $b = lhl^{-1}$ for fixed $l\in G$ , $h\in S$ .
Let $k$ be any element of $G$ : \begin{aligned}
kbk^{-1} &= k(lhl^{-1})k^{-1} \\
&= klhl^{-1}k^{-1} \\
&= (kl)h(kl)^{-1} \\
&\in gSg^{-1}
\end{aligned} Writing $g=kl\in G$ . My questions are: Was I correct in the way I showed that $c(S)\leq G$ ? How can I interpret the definition of $c(S)$ ? How do I show that $c(S)$ is normal in $G$ ? Thank you","['group-theory', 'normal-subgroups']"

I've tried it unsuccessfully. Initially I tried writing $\mathbf{N}=\frac{\mathbf{x}\times\mathbf{y}}{\| \mathbf{x}\times\mathbf{y}\|}=\frac{\mathbf{y}\times\mathbf{z}}{\| \mathbf{y}\times\mathbf{z}\|}=\frac{\mathbf{z}\times\mathbf{x}}{\| \mathbf{z}\times\mathbf{x}\|}$ and substituting into the equation to get $\| \mathbf{x}\times\mathbf{y}\|z +\| \mathbf{y}\times\mathbf{z}\|\mathbf{x}+\| \mathbf{z}\times\mathbf{x}\|\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{0}$ but then I realised these terms are only correct up to $\pm$ signs. You could write the norms in terms of sines of angles and divide by norms to get unit vectors with coefficients $\sin\theta,\sin\psi,\sin(\theta+\psi)$ (or $2\pi -(\theta+\psi)$ I suppose) but I don't know what to do from there, especially when the terms are only correct up to sign. Any hints how to prove this identity? Perhaps there is a clever trick to it but I can't see it.

3155399,Proof of $f\in L^1(\mathbb R)$ then $m\{x\mid |f|=\infty \}=0$. Is my proof correct.,"Let $f\in L^1(\mathbb R)$ . Then $f$ is finite a.e. I did the following proof and my teacher gave me a mark of $0$ . What I did is : Let $E=\{x\mid |f(x)|=\infty \}$ . We have that $$ \int_E|f|\leq \int_{\mathbb R}|f|$$ If $m(E)>0$ then $$\int_E|f|=\infty \cdot m(E)=\infty,$$ and thus $\int_{\mathbb R}|f|=\infty $ which is a contradiction. He says that $a\cdot \infty =\infty $ for $a>0$ is more a convention than something formal. After he justify that if my proof is valid, then someone could make the proof $$\infty \cdot m(E)=\int_E|f|\leq \int_{\mathbb R}|f|<\infty ,$$ and thus $m(E)=0$ . Which is not completely wrong, but with rigor $\infty \cdot 0$ is undeterminated. So he didn't accepted my proof. I'm a bit confuse because for me it's a complete valid proof.

3155438,Problem 2B.4 in Finite Group Theory by Isaacs,"Suppose a finite group $G$ has more than one Sylow-2 subgroup and any two intersects trivially. Show $G$ contains exactly one conjugacy class of involutions.

If $n$ is not a power of 2, then $D_{2n}$ has more than one Sylow 2 subgroups and $D_{2n}$ are generated by them. But any two of the Sylow 2 subgroups of $D_{2n}$ has a nontrival intersection, and any two Sylow-2 subgroups of G intersects trivally, so all  Sylow 2 subgroups of $D_{2n}$ must lie in the same  Sylow-2 subgroup of $G$ .

n=16k+4,\\

To be exact, for the pattern $n=8k+4$ , it requires only three steps of computation to show that $L(n)=L(n+1)$ since they both reach the same number. So I guess there's an interesting problem: given any positive integer $m$ , for what positive constant integers $a, b$ , integers $ak+b$ and $ak+b+1(k = 0, 1, 2, 3,...)$ will reach the same integer after at most $m$ steps?

3155628,Are most physics books wrong about the covariant derivative and connection?,"I have always read in many physics books that a valid way of intuitively introducing the covariant derivative and the connection was the following: (example in GR but same thing for gauge theories) Let $TM$ be the tangent bundle over a manifold $M$ . I define the ""weird"" derivative $\partial^{\mathfrak w}$ of a vector $V$ (only the element of the tangent space obtained by projecting to the second element) at $\gamma(t_o)$ as $$\partial^{\mathfrak w}_WV=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{V_{\gamma(t_o+h)}-V_{\gamma(t_o)}}{h}$$ where $W_{\gamma(t_o)}=\dot\gamma(t_o)$ . This derivative breaks the properties of a vector, because if the limit is to be intended as ""limit of components"" then transition function (jacobian) loses its meaning, whereas if intended as subtraction of differential operators, independent of coordinates, then it does not make sense because they do not take functions over the same point in $M$ . But all of this because I am exceeding out of the fiber. In general here you read in these books that you cannot sum different vectors because they are belonging to different tangent spaces (fibers), so you introduce a covariant differentiation. But we know that the tangent space is a vector bundle and thus it admits a local trivialization, therefore the fibers are locally isomorphic to $\mathbb R^n$ , so the two spaces are indeed isomorphic. $\textbf{Question}$ : I would say that I can define such a weird derivative in the sense of components in $\mathbb R^n$ , I would simply go out of the fiber and thus I can no longer talk about vectors and change of charts.

If we set $z=e^{i(\pi-\alpha)}$ , then the coordinate of $P_n$ is $a_1+a_2z+\cdots+a_n z^{n-1}$ . We must prove that this number is not equal to zero. Using the Abel Summation lemma, we obtain, $$a_1+a_2z+\cdots+a_{n-1}z^n=(a_1-a_2) + (a_2-a_3)(1+z) + \cdots + a_n(1+z+\cdots+z^{n-1})$$ If $\alpha$ is zero, then this quantity is a strictly positive real number, and we are done. If not, multiply by $(1-z)$ to get $(a_1-a_2)(1-z) + (a_2-a_3)(1-z^2) + \cdots + a_n(1-z^n)$ . This expression cannot be zero. Indeed, since $\mid z\mid=1$ , by the triangle inequality, we have, $$\mid (a_1-a_2)z + (a_2-a_3)z^2 + \cdots + a_n z^n \mid < (a_1-a_2) + (a_2-a_3) + (a_3-a_4) + \cdots + a_n$$ The conclusion follows. I was wondering if one can prove this synthetically, without using complex numbers. Any alternate proof or suggestion in the direction of an alternate proof is welcome.","['contest-math', 'euclidean-geometry', 'geometry', 'summation-by-parts', 'complex-numbers']"
3155921,regular sequence $\iff$ complete intersection,"Let $k$ be a field and $X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ a closed subscheme of dimension $n-r$ .
We say $X$ is complete intersection if $X = V(I)$ , where $I$ is a homogeneous ideal which is generated by $r$ elements. Next, for a closed immersion of locally noetherian schemes $f : X \to Y$ , we say that $f$ is a regular immersion of codimension $r$ if at every point $x \in X$ , the kernel of $f^\#_x : \mathscr{O}_{Y, f(x)} \to \mathscr{O}_{X,x}$ is generated by a regular sequence of $r$ elements. Now for $Y = \mathbb{P}^n$ and $i: X \to Y$ , are these two conditions equivalent?
In example 3.5. of Liu's ""Algebraic geometry and arithmetic curves"", the author says that a complete intersection is a regular immersion in this situation. To show this, I think it's sufficient to show that: Let $A$ be a noetherian local integral domain of dimension $n$ , $I$ a proper ideal and suppose that $\dim A/I = n-r$ . Then if $I$ is generated by $r$ elements, then $I$ is generated by a regular sequence of $r$ elements. For our purpose we can assume that $A$ is regular and is finitely generated over a field. I showed that for a generator $f_1, \dots, f_r$ , $\dim A/(f_1, \dots, f_i) = n-i$ .
So $f_{i+1}$ in $A/(f_1, \dots, f_i)$ is not contained in any minimal prime ideal.
Therefore if these $A/(f_1, \dots, f_i)$ are reduced, this sequence is a regular sequence.
And by this , it seems that we can assume these rings reduced. Thank you very much.","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

Definition: $\alpha \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is ideal if $\forall x \in \alpha, \forall y \in \mathbb{R}, xy \in \alpha$ and $\forall x,y \in \alpha, x+y \in \alpha$ I've split up the claim as such: if $\alpha \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is ideal then $\alpha \neq \{0\} \implies \alpha = \mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha \neq \mathbb{R} \implies \alpha = \{0\}$ Proof: (first bullet) ( $\subseteq$ ) this is given. ( $\supseteq$ ) Let $a \in \mathbb{R}$ . Since $\alpha \neq \{0\}$ , $\exists b \in \alpha$ such that $b \neq 0$ . Combining (1) and (2), we get $$b+ab = c$$ for some $c \in \alpha$ . Rearranging this equation, we get $$a+1=\frac{c}{b}$$ (recall that $b \neq 0)$ .

Thus, by (1), $$\frac{c}{b} = c \cdot \frac{1}{b} = a+1 \in \alpha$$ But $a+1$ is still an arbitrary element in $\mathbb{R}$ , so we have shown that $\mathbb{R} \subseteq \alpha$ , as needed.

We are tasked with building a network of roads that connect all the cities. The travelling distance (T) of this network is defined as the sum of the distance you must travel along a road to get from point A to B, and point A to C, ... and all six combinations of points. Suppose we're given a certain budget, which will enable us to construct a length L of roads. Where should we build the roads, to minimise T ? And what is the relation between L and T ? As the question linked to above describes, there are no solutions possible if L < 1+√3. When L = 1+√3, it is only possible to construct one network to connect all the cities (the first option in the diagram below). Here, T = 2*(2/√3) + 4*(1+1/√3) = 4 + 8/√3 =  8.6188... If we were given slightly more budget, the best use (I believe) would be to shift the two junction points slightly closer together. Once L = 2√2, the network simplifies to two roads, from A to C, and B to D, and now T = 6√2 (the second option in the diagram below). Then, as L increases, the optimal network evolves - each infinitesimal unit of road seems to reduce T by approximately 0.76 units.  Once L = 4 + 2√2 , we can construct a network that connects each point to the other, and T = 4 + 2√2. But is this process which I show in the diagram the optimal process?

\mathcal M:=\{ M=(M)_{t\geq 0}\ | \ M \text{ is } \mathcal F_t\text{-martingale with continuous paths},\ M_0=0, M \text{ is bounded in } L^2(\mathbb P)\} 
\end{align} We said for all $M\in\mathcal M$ we have the existence of $M_\infty^2$ and $\langle M\rangle_\infty$ , where $\langle \cdot\rangle $ is the quadratic variation process. Now we may define an innerproduct on $\mathcal M$ as follows: \begin{align}
(M,N):=\mathbb E[\langle M,N\rangle_\infty]
\end{align} The space $\mathcal M$ with the given innnerproduct is a Hilbert space. We say $H\in L^2(M)$ iff $H$ is progressively measurable and \begin{align}
\|H\|_{L^2(M)}^2:=\mathbb E\left[ \int^\infty_0 H_s^2\,d\langle M\rangle_s\right]<\infty
\end{align} Let us fix $H\in L^2(M)$ and define a functional $f_H$ on $\mathcal M$ as follows \begin{align}
f_H(N)=\mathbb E\left[\int^\infty_0 H_s\,d\langle M,N\rangle_s \right]
\end{align} Using Kunita Watanabe we can get \begin{align}
|f_H(N)|\leq \|H\|_{L^2(M)}\|N\|_{\mathcal M}
\end{align} We can use Riesz to get an element which we will call $H\bullet M\in\mathcal M$ the integral of $H$ with respect to $M$ , and \begin{align}
f_H(N)=(H\bullet M, N)
\end{align} but more importantly is that we also get for free that the operator norm of $f_H$ satisfies $\|f_H\|=\|H\bullet M\|_{\mathcal M}$ . Problem. Prove that $\|H\|_{L^2(M)}=\|H\bullet M\|_{\mathcal M}$ . I can prove this using properties of $H\bullet M$ and Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral. But I want to prove it using $\|f_H\|=\|H\|_{L^2(M)}$ . Question. How to prove that $\|f_H\|=\|H\|_{L^2(M)}$ not knowing about the integral $H\bullet M$ and everything related to that? I mean only by looking at the functional $f$ itself. I already have the inequality $\|f_H\|\leq \|H\|_{L^2(M)}$ . So we either need to find $N$ for which $|f_H(N)|=\|H\|_{L^2(M)}\|N\|_{\mathcal M}$ or a sequence of $X^{(n)}$ for which $\|X^{(n)}\|_{\mathcal M}=1$ and \begin{align}
|f_H(X^{(n)})|\to \|H\|_{L^2(M)}
\end{align} I want to do this because I believe that it may increase my knowledge about elements of $\mathcal M$ and dealing with such operators on that space. The answer that I'm seeking is from the following perspective. Consider yourself as someone who never saw ito integral and just knows the space $\mathcal M$ and $L^2(M)$ and the functional $f_H$ . How would you then find the norm of $f_H$ ? Edit. I would be also satisfied if someone provides a solution for a possible simple case where $M$ is a (nicely, but not too trivial) stopped Brownian motion, for example $B_{t\wedge 1}$ or so.","['stochastic-integrals', 'stochastic-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'martingales', 'stochastic-calculus']"

$$ Prove $\{x_n\}$ converges. I'm trying to generalize the idea from this question . Below are some thoughts. First denote: $$
S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \alpha_k
$$ Since $S_n$ is convergent then it must be bounded both below and above. Let: $$
y_n = x_n - S_{n-1}
$$ Since $x_n$ is bounded above and $-S_n$ is also bounded above (by convergence of $S_n$ ), then it must follow that $y_n$ is also bounded above: $$
\exists M\in\Bbb R: y_n \le M, \forall n\in\Bbb N \tag2
$$ Rewrite $(1)$ as: $$
x_{n+1} \ge x_n + \alpha_n
$$ Now subtract $S_n$ from both sides: $$
\underbrace{x_{n+1} - S_n}_{y_{n+1}} \ge x_n - S_n + \alpha_n = \underbrace{x_n - S_{n-1}}_{y_n}

\exists \lim_{n\to\infty}y_n \implies \exists\lim_{n\to\infty}(x_n - S_{n-1})

I thought it would be a shame to let such an unreasonably difficult question go to waste, so I decided I would share it. The problem simply states: Solve for $f$ : $$f(x)=2\log(x)^2f\left(x^\frac{3}{8}\right)^2f\left(x^\frac{1}{4}\right)^2$$ No other information or context is given, but I'm assuming that $f$ is a complex valued function of a single real or complex variable (since evaluating the function for negative $x$ would require $f(x)$ to be complex), and that $\log$ is the natural logarithm (since no one would use it for log base-10 if they were talking about complex functions). For curiosity's sake, I present it as a challenge to either solve for $f$ or prove that a solution does not exist there is one and only one solution (at least one solution exists, courtesy of Chrystomath). My own attempts at solving have been... unsuccessful. Edit: In their answer, Chrystomath provides a solution: $$f(x)=a\log(x)^{-\frac{2}{3}}\quad:\quad a\in\left\{z\in\mathbb{C}\Bigg| z^9=\frac{6^4}{8^9}\right\}$$ Which is quite possibly the most multivalued multivalued function I've ever seen.

3157402,"Every Borel contains a Cartan, and conjugacy theorems: A simple proof?","Conjugacy of Borel subalgebras $\newcommand{\ad}{\mathrm{ad}\,}$ Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ . A Borel subalgebra $\mathfrak{b} \subseteq \mathfrak{g}$ is a maximal solvable subalgebra. It is a classic theorem that all Borel subalgebras of semisimple $\mathfrak{g}$ are conjugate under the action of $\langle \exp(\ad x): x \in \mathfrak{g} \text{ ad-nilpotent}\rangle$ , or the adjoint action of an algebraic group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ , the first sense implying the second. The proof I know of (e.g. in Humphrey's Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory ) are very involved, involving a complicated induction on the dimension of intersection of two Borel subalgebras, as well as on the dimension of the ambient Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ . Conjugacy of Cartan subalgebras In contrast, there is a short, geometric proof that all Cartan subalgebras of a semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ are conjugate. One uses the following lemma from algebraic geometry: Lemma : If $f: \mathbb{A}^m \to \mathbb{A}^n$ has $df_x$ surjective for some $x \in \mathbb{A}^m$ , then the image of $f$ contains a dense open subset of $\mathbb{A}^n$ . Now given a root space decomposition $$ \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{h} \oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Phi} \mathfrak{g}_\alpha$$ with root vectors $x_\alpha \in \mathfrak{g}_\alpha$ , define $f: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}$ by $$ f(h + \sum_{\alpha \in \Phi} t_\alpha x_\alpha) = \left(\prod_{\alpha \in \Phi} \exp (t_\alpha \ad x_\alpha)\right) h,$$ where $h \in \mathfrak{h}$ and the product is taken in some fixed order.
The differential at any regular element of $\mathfrak{h}$ is nonzero, which shows that the conjugates of $\mathfrak{h}$ under the exponentials of nilpotent elements of $\mathfrak{g}$ contains a dense open subset of $\mathfrak{g}$ , and thus intersects the conjugates of any other Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h'}$ . Further, as regular semisimple elements are dense in $\mathfrak{g}$ , every Cartan contains a regular semisimple element and thus is equal to the centralizer of a regular semisimple element. Hope for a better life Further, one can show that if a Borel subalgebra $\mathfrak{b}$ contains the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h} \subseteq \mathfrak{g}$ , then $\mathfrak{b}$ must be one of the ""standard"" Borel subalgebras associated to $\mathfrak{h}$ , formed by taking the sum of $\mathfrak{h}$ with all positive roots (after fixing such a choice of positive roots). The problem of showing that all Borel subalgebras are conjugate thus reduces to showing that every Borel subalgebra contains a Cartan. This leads to the question: Is there a geometric argument for that every Borel subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ contains a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ , akin to the geometric argument for Cartan subalgebras above? It would be helpful even to have a geometric argument showing that every Borel subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ contains a regular semisimple element.","['algebraic-geometry', 'representation-theory', 'lie-algebras', 'algebraic-groups']"

3157526,Prove that if $f$ is a diffeomorphism than its differential $D_{f}$ is an isomorphism,"I want to prove that if $f : U \to V$ , when $U,V \subset R^n$ , is a diffeomorphism than its differential $D_{f}$ is an isomorphism. Since $D_{f}$ is a linear transformation, isomorphism means that it's both injective and surjective.
Moreover, $D_{f}$ is between two vector spaces with the same dimension (both are $R^{n*n}$ ) then we can use the dimension theorem for vector spaces. So we really need to prove only that $D_{f}$ is injective (or surjective). However, I don't really see how to do it. I know that $f$ is $C^1$ (continuously differential) and also $f^{-1}$ is $C^1$ . Maybe, because the inverse of $D_f$ is $D_{f^{-1}}$ . So if $D_f$ is not injective then it doesn't have an inverse - contradiction. I'm not really sure if I'm right here.

The paper does neither prove this nor provide a reference to any known theorem proving this, which leaves me with the question: Why is this true? Can anybody point me to a result that shows this?

Prove $f$ is a polynomial.,"Let $f : \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be an entire function such that $|f(z)| \rightarrow  \infty$ as $|z| \rightarrow  \infty$ . Prove that $f$ is a polynomial by following the steps below. (a) Observe that the function $f(1/z)$ defined in $C \setminus\{0\}$ has a pole at the origin. Let $S$ be the

For point (a) I wrote In order for $|f(z)| \rightarrow  \infty$ as $|z| \rightarrow  \infty$ , is equavalent saying $|f(\frac{1}{z})| \rightarrow  \infty$ as $z \rightarrow 0$ . So $f(z)$ can be written in Laurent series around the point $0$ such that $\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_nz^n = g(z) + s(\frac{1}{z})$ given $g(z)$ is the power series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n$ and $S$ is the singular part of its Laurent series around $0$ .

with Riemann's removable singularity theorem, with $p$ being some removable singularity. $g(z)$ can be extended continuously and holomorphically at $p$ and since $g(z)$ is bonded on some disc around $p$ excluding the point $p$ with a radius bigger than $0$ .

3157632,Equivalence condition of Absolute Continuity,"Let me restate my point. The intuition behind this construction is straightforward. Let $f$ be a continuous increasing function. Take out pieces of the graph of $f$ which is correspond to a collection of finite disjoint subintervals, then glue them together to make a new function $g$ . If we claim every $g$ must be continuous, then by the definition of continuity $\forall \delta\exists\epsilon$ such that “total length of the intervals $<\epsilon$ ” implies “total variation of $f$ on these intervals< $\delta$ ” which means $f$ is absolute continuous. This is not so sensible, so I hypotheze that $g$ is not necessarily continuous even if $f$ is. $f:I\to\mathbb R$ is continuous. Take finite number of subintervals $[x_1,y_1]\cup [x_2,y_2],...,\cup[x_n,y_n]=\mathcal K\subseteq I$ , where $\sum_k\mu([x_k,y_k])=K$ , i.e. $|\mathcal K|=K$ . Let's consider the the part of graph of $f$ constrained in $\mathcal K$ . Rigorous definition follows. Define function $g:[x_1,x_1+K]\to\mathbb R$ such that, if $x\in[x_1,y_1],$ then $g(x)=f(x)$ , if $x\in[y_1,y_1+y_2-x_2]$ , then $g(x)=f(x-y_1+x_2)+c_1$ , where $c_2=f(y_1)-f(x_2)$ . We thus define $x_1'=x_1$ , $y_1'=y_1$ , $x_2'=y_1$ , $y_2'=x_2'+y_2-x_2$ , and, recursively, $x_k'=y_{k-1}', y_k'=x_k'+y_k-x_k$ . If $(x+y_k')\in[y_k',y_k'+y_{k+1}-x_{k+1}]$ , then $g(x+y_k')=f(x+y_k)+c_k$ , and $c_k=g(y_k')-f(y_k)$ . We call $g$ a clipping of $f$ at $\mathcal K$ : $g=clip(f,\mathcal K)$ . Intuitively, $g(x)$ is exactly equivalent to $f(x)$ on each interval up to the equivalent class of affine transformation. Consider the following condition: Condition 1: $\forall\mathcal K\subseteq I$ , $g=clip(f,\mathcal K)$ is continuous. Is  this condition a necessary and sufficient condition for the absolute continuity of $f$ on $I$ ?  Can it be extended to multidimensional functions? Is the morphism ""clipping"" well studied? This is showing that $g$ may not continuous even if $f$ is continuous. $g$ is not continuous at $x_1$ means: $\exists\delta\forall\epsilon\exists y$ such that $|x_1-y|<\epsilon$ but $|f(x_1)-f(y)|=\delta$ Let $f$ the Cantor function. Let $n$ be a natural number. At the $n$ -th stage of the construction of the Cantor set, a disjoint collection ${[x_k, y_k]}_{1<k<2^n} $ of $2^n$ subintervals of $I=[0, 1]$ have been constructed that cover the Cantor set, each of which has length $(1/3)^n$ . The Cantor-Lebesgue function is constant on each of the intervals that comprise the complement in $[0, 1]$ of this collection of intervals. We have $\sum_{k\leq 2^n}(y_k-x_k)=K<(2/3)^n$ while $\sum_{k\leq 2^n}(f(y_k)-f(x_k))=1$ $\forall \epsilon>0$ $\exists n>0$ such that $K<\epsilon$ . By definition, $K=y_k'-x_k$ , and $\sum_{k\leq 2^n}(f(y_k)-f(x_k))=g(y'_k)-g(x_k)$ . That is : $\exists\delta=1\forall\epsilon\exists y=y_k'$ such that $|x_1-y'_k|<\epsilon$ but $|g(x_1)-g(y_k')|=\delta$ . $g$ is not continuous. It is well known that, in the definition of absolute continuity, the word ""finite"" can be replaced by ""countably infinite"": A function $f: I \to \mathbb{R}$ is absolutely continuous on an interval $I$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is a $\delta > 0$ such that whenever a countable sequence of pairwise disjoint sub-intervals $(x_k, y_k)$ of $E$ satisfies $$ \sum_{k} |y_{k} - x_{k}| < \delta$$ then $$\sum_{k} |f(y_{k}) - f(x_{k})| < \epsilon$$ We know that the square wave can be written as the infinite sum of forms of sine functions: $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n h_i(x)$ . Each $h_i$ is continuous but the limit is not. Let $H_n=\sum_{i=1}^n h_i(x)$ . $H_n$ should be continuous by induction. If $H_n$ is indeed continuous at $x=0$ then $\forall \delta\exists\epsilon\forall y\in\mathbb R$ such that $|y-x|<\epsilon$ implies $|f(y)-f(x)|<\delta$ . However, $\forall \epsilon>0$ $\exists n>0$ such that $|y-x|<\epsilon$ and $f(y)-f(0)=1$ , contradition! To Ramiro: Let assume $f$ is increasing. Your answer seems imply that, if $f$ is continuous, then $g$ is continuous, then $\forall \delta\exists\epsilon\forall y_n'$ such that $|y_n'-x_1|<\epsilon$ implies $|g(y_n')-g(x_1)|<\delta$ ; we know $K=\sum_{i\leq n} |y_i-x_i|,$ and $ \sum_{i\leq n} |f(y_i)-f(x_i)|=|g(y_n')-g(x_1)|$ , SO: Take any one collection of disjoint interval $\mathcal K$ such that $\sum_{i\leq n} |y_i-x_i|<\epsilon$ , this implies $K<\epsilon$ , which implies $|g_\mathcal K(y_n')-g_\mathcal K(x_1)|<\delta$ , which implies $\sum_{i\leq n} |f(y_i)-f(x_i)|<\delta$ . Then $f$ is absolute continuous! I am not sure that a single $g$ is required.","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'continuity', 'calculus', 'absolute-continuity']"

These functions are interesting because they include certain other special functions as special cases. For example, the polylogarithms: $$\mathrm{Li}_s(x)=\mathrm{Gi}_s^{1,1}(x)$$ and the inverse tangent integrals: $$\mathrm{Ti}_s(x)=-i\cdot\mathrm{Gi}_s^{2,1}(ix)$$ and the interesting relation $$\mathrm{Gi}_s^{p,p}(x)=\frac1{p^s}\mathrm{Li}_s(x^p)$$ As well as the Hurwitz zeta function: $$\mathrm{Gi}_s^{1,q}(1)=\zeta(s,q)$$ And similarily, a relation to the Lerch Transcendent: $$\Phi(z,s,\alpha)=\frac1{z^\alpha}\mathrm{Gi}_s^{1,\alpha}(z)$$ What I've found out so far is detailed below. A hyper-geometric representation We may note that $$\mathrm{Gi}_s^{p,q}(x)=x^q\sum_{n\geq0}\frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{(pn+q)^s}\frac{x^{pn}}{n!}$$ Setting $$t_n=\frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{(pn+q)^s}$$ We have that $$\frac{t_{n+1}}{t_n}=\frac{(n+1)(n+q/p)^s}{(n+q/p+1)^s}$$ so we have that $$\mathrm{Gi}_s^{p,q}(x)=x^q\,_{s+1}F_{s}\left(1,\frac{q}{p},...,\frac{q}{p};1+\frac{q}{p},...,1+\frac{q}{p};x^p\right)$$ A recurrence We may notice that $$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\mathrm{Gi}_s^{p,q}(x)&=\sum_{n\geq0}\frac{x^{pn+q-1}}{(pn+q)^{s-1}}\\
&=\frac1x\sum_{n\geq0}\frac{x^{pn+q}}{(pn+q)^{s-1}}\\
&=\frac1x\mathrm{Gi}_{s-1}^{p,q}(x)\\
\end{align}$$ So we of course have the $\mathrm{Li}$ -style recurrence $$\mathrm{Gi}_s^{p,q}(x)=\int_0^x \frac{\mathrm{Gi}_{s-1}^{p,q}(t)}{t}\mathrm dt$$ With the easily shown base case of $$\mathrm{Gi}_0^{p,q}(x)=\frac{x^q}{1-x^p}$$ from which the recursive definitions of $\mathrm{Ti}$ and $\mathrm{Li}$ follow. We may also consider the function $$\mathrm{Fi}_s^{p,q}(x)=\sum_{n\geq0}(-1)^n\frac{x^{pn+q}}{(pn+q)^s}$$ And by defining $\lambda_p=\exp\frac{i\pi}{p}$ , we have $$\mathrm{Gi}_s^{p,q}(\lambda_p x)=\lambda_{p}^{q}\mathrm{Fi}_s^{p,q}(x)$$","['power-series', 'zeta-functions', 'special-functions', 'sequences-and-series']"

Are the logarithms of primes quadratically independent over $\mathbb Q$ , i.e. $$\sum_{ij\le N}a_{ij} \log p_i \log p_j = 0, \quad a_{ij} \in \mathbb Q, \quad \implies a_{ij} = -a_{ji} $$ ?","['field-theory', 'number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'logarithms']"
3158161,"Is ""ordinary differential equations in more than two variables"" correct? Used in two books","I have seen the formulation ""ordinary differential equations in more than two variables"" in two books. Is this terminology really correct? The books : The first book is Elements of Partial Differential Equations by Ian N. Sneddon. Chapter 1 is called Ordinary differential equations in more than two variables ( the chapter at Google Books )
: In this chapter we shall discuss the propertires of ordinary differential equations in more than two variables. ... ... if in the rectangular Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$ of a point in three-dimensional space are connected by a single relation of the type $$ f(x,y,z)=0 \tag{1}$$ the point lies on a surface. ... To demonstrate this generally we suppose a point $(x,y,z)$ satisfying equation $(1)$ . Then any increments $(\delta x, \delta y, \delta z)$ in $(x,y,z)$ are related by the equation $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\delta x + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\delta y +\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\delta z=0$$ so that two of them can be chose arbitrarily. The second book is A Treatise on Differential Equations by George Boole and chapter XII is called Ordinary differential equations in more than two variables ( the chapter at Google Books ): The class of equations which we shall first consider in this Chapter, is represented by the typical form, $$
P\, dx + Q\, dy + R\, dz = 0,
$$ $P$ , $Q$ and $R$ being functions of the variables $x$ , $y$ , $z$ ; and it is usually termed a total differential equation of the first order with three variables. I'm confused over the terminology of using ""ordinary"" and ""many variables"" in the same sentence.  Isn't a ordinary differential equation always one variable and if more than one variable it's  instead a partial differential equation?","['terminology', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"
3158178,Example of factorization in a polynomial ring which is not an UFD,"I'm looking for a particular example of a polynomial ring $A[x]$ , with $A$ integral domain, which is not an UFD. An easy example is $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}][x]$ , here $6 x^2 = (2x)(3x) = ((1+\sqrt{-5})x)((1-\sqrt{-5})x)$ . I would like to find a ring and a polynomial where the problem is not only in the coefficients. In other words a ring $A[x]$ where there exist a polynomial $f \in A[x]$ with two factorizations that are not of the form $f = (a_1g)(b_1h) = (a_2 g)(b_2h)$ , with $g,h \in A[x]$ , $a = a_1b_1 = a_2b_2 \in A$ (with $a_1b_1, a_2b_2$ two factorization of $a$ ). Or not of a similar form with more factors.",['abstract-algebra']
3158182,How do you solve the trigonometric equation $\sin(x)+x=9$?,"How do you solve the trigonometric equation $\sin(x)+x=9$ ? More generally, how do you solve equations with both trigs and 'x's without graphing ? And maybe I only want real number answers. Suggestions and edit: If you use the Taylor Series, you will basically end up with at least $6^{th}$ degree equations, if you want to make it close. Equation Solvers Are NOT Allowed. That will kind of limit you to this:(assuming you make careless mistakes, just like me, so you don't want cubic equations) $$x+x=9.$$ This yields $x=4.5$ , which is DEFINITELY a bad estimation. Thanks for helping me! It's just that I don't know what Newton-Ralphson and iterations are. Can you explain it to me or give me a link?",['trigonometry']
