3280837,Is there more to this relationship with the Fibonacci numbers?,"So I recently thought of a cool way to represent the Fibonacci sequence, which provides many identities really interestingly. The key is to define $$x^2=x+1$$ And consider the integer sequences given by $$x^n=a_nx+b_n$$ These sequences satisfy $F_{n+2}=F_{n+1}+F_n$ and $a_1=a_2=b_2=b_3=1$ , thus producing the Fibonacci sequence. This is easily verifiable: \begin{align}\color{blue}{a_{n+2}}x+\color{green}{b_{n+2}}&=x^{n+2}\\&=x^nx^2\\&=x^n(x+1)\\&=x^{n+1}+x^n\\&=a_{n+1}x+b_{n+1}+a_nx+b_n\\&=(\color{blue}{a_{n+1}+a_n})x+(\color{green}{b_{n+1}+b_n})\end{align} One can also come up with a simple $\mathcal O(\log(n))$ algorithm to compute $F_n$ using exponentiation by squaring: \begin{align}\color{blue}{a_{2n}}x+\color{green}{b_{2n}}&=x^{2n}\\&=(x^n)^2\\&=(a_nx+b_n)^2\\&=a_n^2x^2+2a_nb_nx+b_n^2\\&=a_n^2(x+1)+2a_nb_nx+b_n^2\\&=\color{blue}{a_n(a_n+2b_n)}x+\color{green}{a_n^2+b_n^2}\end{align} And similarly for $x^{2n+1}$ . This also quickly gives some other cool identities using the fact that $x^{n+k}=x^nx^k$ , for example. I was thinking, however, that this is just way too convenient. I'm unsure how to generalize this . For example, what if I wanted to start at different integers? I'm also curious to know if there's something more to this. Some deeper math behind the scenes that can explain why I'm able to write the Fibonacci sequence like this aside from just brute force showing it satisfies the definition. As far as starting at different integers goes, we can consider the sequences given by $$x^n(a_0x+a_1-a_0)=a_nx+b_n$$ which preserves the recurrence relation and lets us choose what we want $a_0$ and $a_1$ to be. As far as I can tell, it is possible to do this to any recurrence relation of the form $$x_{n+k}=y_1x_{n+k-1}+\dots+y_kx_n$$ by considering the corresponding $$x^k=y_1x^{k-1}+\dots+y_k$$ and considering the sequences given by $$x^nP(x)=a_nx+b_n$$ for some polynomial $P$ which corresponds to the initial conditions, provided $x$ is irrational to ensure uniqueness. So this leaves me the question of whether or not there's more math relevant here aside from my just stumbling upon this. I ask this because I think this kind of identity is just ""too good to be true"", especially for me to not have noticed this kind of thing despite having seen plenty of recurrence relations before.","['fibonacci-numbers', 'recurrence-relations', 'sequences-and-series', 'recreational-mathematics', 'soft-question']"
3280930,"$f$ is holomorphic in $B(z_0,r)\setminus\{z_0\}$ and does not except real values. Then $z_0$ is a removable singularity","$f$ is holomorphic at $B(z_0,r)\setminus\{z_0\}$ and $f$ doesn't except real values - i.e $f(z)\notin\mathbb{R}$ for all $z\in \mathbb{R}$ . Then $z_0$ is a removable singularity point ( $f$ can be extended holomorphically in $z_0$ ). Well I tried to use Riemann theorem, and show that $\exists 0<r'\le r$ such that $f$ is bounded in $B(z_0,r)$ , but didn't succeed to do so. Formerly I solved a similar question which demand that $\Re(f)>0$ and then by defining $e^{-f(z)}$ which is holomorphic and bounded, which by taking $log$ holomorphic branch promises $f$ is holomorphic. Is there any manipulation or composition I may make to $f$ , to get a similar results? I also tried to assume that $f$ is not bounded, so in $B(z_0,r)$ one may find $z$ such that $|f(z)|$ is arbitrary big. However, is there any kind of intermediate value principle which assures that $f$ must ""cross"" the real line in case $|f(z)|$ is not bounded in $B(z_0,r)$ ?","['complex-analysis', 'singularity']"

f(x) = \frac{\pi x}{2L} + \varepsilon \Big(1 - \frac{x}{L}\Big).

3281040,Solve integral $\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}(x^2+x+1)}dx$ using substitution $x=\sinh t$,"How to solve the definite Integral $$\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}\ (x^2+x+1)}dx=\frac{\ln(2+\sqrt{3})}{\sqrt{3}}$$ with the hyperbolic function $x=\sinh t$ ? Below is using the usual substitution $x=\tan t$ to do it. I thought it is the same because $\sinh^2t+1=\cosh^2t$ is similar with $\tan^2t+1=\sec^2t$ . But, It isn't... Substituting $$x=\tan t, dt=\sec^2{t} \ dx ,(0\leq t\leq\pi/2)$$ So, we get $$
\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}(x^2+x+1)}dx =\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\sec{t}}{1+\tan{t}+\tan^2{t}}dt \\=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\cos{t}}{1+\sin{t}\cos{t}}dt\\=I
$$ Note that $\cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-t\right)}=\sin{t}$ , hence substituting $t=\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta$ , we have $\cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-t\right)}=\sin{t}$ , hence substituting $t=\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta$ , we have $$
\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\cos{t}}{1+\sin{t}\cos{t}}dt=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\sin{\theta}}{1+\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta}}d\theta=I
$$ Therefore, by substitution $ \sin{t}-\cos{t}=\xi, (\sin{t}+\cos{t})dt=d\xi $ $$
2I=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\cos{t}+\sin{t}}{1+\sin{t}\cos{t}}dt\\=\int_{-1}^{1}\frac{1}{1+\frac{1-\xi^2}{2}}d\xi \\=\int_{-1}^{1}\frac{1}{3-\xi^2}d\xi \\=\frac{1}{\sqrt3}\int_{-1}^{1}\frac{1}{\sqrt3-\xi}+\frac{1}{\sqrt3+\xi}d\xi \\=\frac{1}{ \sqrt3 }\left(\ln(\sqrt3-\xi)-\ln(\sqrt3+\xi) \bigg\rvert_{-1}^{1}\right)\\=\frac{2\ln(2+\sqrt{3})}{\sqrt3}
$$ Because of the result, given integral is $$I=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}(x^2+x+1)}dx=\frac{\ln(2+\sqrt{3})}{\sqrt{3}}$$ What is actually different with this using the substitution $x=\sinh t$ instead?","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'hyperbolic-functions', 'trigonometric-integrals', 'substitution']"

3281091,Differential Forms without Leibniz notation,"I have been learning differential forms recently and I was wondering if there is a replacement for the usual notation involving differentials. What I mean is essentially a replacement of the ""differentials"" for example instead of the usual 1 form: $df=\sum\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}dx_n$ Something along the lines of: $?f=\sum f_{x_n}?x_n$ Where ?'s represent some new notation. My reasoning for wanting a different notation is 2 fold: I find Leibniz notation very vague and misleading in general and honestly much less intuitive than other derivative notations. My biggest issue with Leibniz notation is separation of variables because students learn about it through Leibniz notation instead of the chain rule. Ignoring any issues with Leibniz notation itself I don't really see a direct connection between these differential forms since they really just represent basis co-vectors. Here is an example of why this is bad notation other than my personal opinion. $$
\int \int f(x) dx\wedge dx = \int \int 0 = 0
$$ Instead of the classical double integral which does not always equal 0: $$
\int \int f(x) dxdy
$$ A new student might naively think the above integrals are the same which is a reasonable assumption since $$
\int\int f(x,y)dx\wedge dy = \int \int f(x,y)dxdy

3281092,Quotient field operations are well-defined: fleshing out Vinberg's sketch,"Let $A$ be a non-trivial integral domain. Define the relation $\sim$ on the set of pairs $A \times A\setminus\{0_A\}$ as follows: $$(a_1,b_1) \sim (a_2,b_2) \overset{\text{def}}{\Longleftrightarrow} a_1b_2=a_2b_1.$$ It turns out that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $A \times A\setminus\{0_A\}$ . Addition and multiplication procedure is defined as follows. $$(a_1,b_1)+(a_2,b_2) \overset{\text{def}}{=} (a_1b_2+a_2b_1,b_1b_2)\\(a_1,b_1)\cdot(a_2,b_2)\overset{\text{def}}{=}(a_1a_2,b_1b_2).$$ If one wishes to define such operations similarly on the set of equivalence classes by $\sim$ , that is on the set $(A \times A\setminus\{0_A\})/\!\sim$ , one must prove the operations agree with the relation $\sim$ . In other words, it must be shown these procedures give a well-defined function, not depending on the choice of representative from an equivalence class. Here is how I would prove the result in the case of addition. Let $(a,b)\sim(a_1,b_1)$ and $(c,d) \sim (c_1,d_1)$ be any pairs in $A \times A\setminus\{0_A\}$ . We need to show that $(a,b)+(c,d)$ is $\sim$ -equivalent to $(a_1,b_1)+(c_1,d_1)$ , that is $(ad+bc)b_1d_1 = (a_1d_1+b_1c_1)bd.$ Hence, look at the expression $E:=(ad+bc) b_1d_1$ . Using distributivity in $A$ , we have $E=(ad)b_1d_1+(bc)b_1d_1$ . Using commutativity (and associativity) of multiplication, $E=(ab_1)dd_1+(cd_1)bb_1$ . But because $(a,b)\sim(a_1,b_1)$ and $(c,d) \sim (c_1,d_1)$ , we may replace $ab_1=a_1b$ , and $cd_1=c_1d$ . Therefore, $E=(a_1b)dd_1+(c_1d)bb_1$ . Again via distributivity (and commutativity, associativity), finally $E=(a_1d_1+b_1c_1)bd$ . QED Here is how E. B. Vinberg does it in A Course of Algebra , page 130. Define now addition and multiplication of pairs by the following rules: $$(a_1,b_1)+(a_2,b_2) = (a_1b_2+a_2b_1,b_1b_2)\\(a_1,b_1)(a_2,b_2)=(a_1a_2,b_1b_2).$$ We will prove that the equivalence relation defined above agrees with these operations. By the preceding discussion , it suffices to show that when we multiply both entries in one of the pairs $(a_1,b_1)$ or $(a_2,b_2)$ by the same element $c$ , their sum and product get replaced by equivalent pairs. But it is clear that when we do this, both entries in the sum and the product are multiplied by $c$ . (Emphasis added by me). Q: Why does it suffice to show only what Vinberg says? To emphasise, ""the preceding discussion"" is quoted in either my previous question in yellow quote boxes, or here in this post. The order of the book is preserved. I thought it would be a poor idea to again quote the full passage here due to length.

BUT , in order to contrast better the result I continued with my simulation and went beyond the 100K (>300M), this is the result: It seems that there are more categories, even in regions where the sliding window passes the same number of times.

Now $f(0+1) = 1 \le f(0) + 1$ , so $f(0)$ must be $0$ . Notice also that $f(2) \le 2$ and $f(x) \le x$ for $x$ integers. Also $$f(0+5) \ge f(0) + 5 = 5$$ and $$f(4+1)=f(5) \le f(4) + 1 \le 5$$ so we must have $f(5)=5$ . Notice that this is true for all integers, $f(x)=x$ . So the 2nd statement is also incorrect.

3281442,Question regarding the Taub-NUT metric on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+$.,"I have a question regarding Claude Lebrun's paper Complete Ricci-flat Kähler metrics on $\mathbb{C}^n$ need not be flat. In the introduction of the paper, he writes that the Taub-NUT metric is given explicitly by $$g = \frac{\rho +1}{4 \rho} d\rho^2 + \rho(1+\rho) \left[ \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2 \right] + \frac{\rho}{\rho+1}\sigma_3^2,$$ where $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3$ is a left-invariant coframe for $\mathbb{S}^3$ and where $\rho \in \mathbb{R}^+$ . He continues to mention that there is a common erroneous assertion which maintains that this metric is not Kähler -- the reasoning being that with respect to the most obvious integrable almost complex structure $(\sigma_1 \mapsto \sigma_2, \sigma_3 \mapsto -(1+\rho)d\rho/2\rho)$ , the metric is Hermitian but not Kähler. However, the metric has self-dual curvature tensor, and so has holonomy $SU(2)$ . Q: I want to verify that the above almost complex structure is integrable. It seems that the most straightforward way of doing this is by showing that the Nijenhuis tensor vanishes identically. We can write vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+$ as $X = \alpha_1 \sigma_1 + \alpha_2 \sigma_2 + \alpha_3 \sigma_3 + \alpha_4 d\rho$ and $Y = \beta_1 \sigma_1 + \beta_2 \sigma_2 + \beta_3 \sigma_3 + \beta_4 d\rho$ . Then \begin{eqnarray*}
JX &=& \alpha_1 \sigma_2 - \alpha_2 \sigma_1 - \alpha_3 \frac{1+\rho}{2\rho} d\rho - \alpha_4 \frac{2\rho}{1+\rho} \sigma_3, \\
JY &=& \beta_1 \sigma_2 - \beta_2 \sigma_1 - \beta_3 \frac{1+\rho}{2\rho} d\rho - \beta_4 \frac{2\rho}{1+\rho} \sigma_3.

3281841,How Does Ramanujan’s Master Theorem Work?,"I am trying to understand Ramanujan' Master theorem, but I really can't seem to wrap my head around it. So the theorem states that if you have a function $F$ such that you can write it as $$F(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac {w(k)(-x)^k}{k!}$$ for some analytic or integrable function $w$ , then the Mellin transform of $F$ is $$I=\int_0^\infty x^{n-1}F(x)dx= \Gamma(n)w(-n).$$ However, there are some related parts that confuse me: The definition of $w$ by the series in the first expression just requires $w$ to take certain values for $k=0,1,\ldots,\infty$ , but not for any values in $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{N}_0$ . Is this really enough to uniquely define $w$ ? If so why? A typical example would be $w(k)=1$ for all $k$ . In that case, we get $F(x)=e^{-x}$ and $I=\Gamma(n)$ . However, if I instead use $w(k)=cos(2\pi k)$ , then I still get $F(x)=e^{-x}$ . However, for this $w$ I get $I(n)=\Gamma(n)cos(-2\pi n)$ , which agrees on $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ but not anywhere else. Obviously, these can't both be correct. Both $w$ are integrable, so why is one of the choices of $w$ incorrect? (this is likely related to the first) Why do we require the minus in the expression?

3281854,Unobserved values in SVD and matrix factorization problems,"In class, in the context of matrix completion (recommender Systems, collaborative filtering), we have seen that the Eckart-Young theorem says the best rank- $k$ approximation to a matrix $A$ is given by taking the dominant first $k < \mbox{rank}(A)$ singular values. Thus, if we have a rating matrix, like in the Netflix data, it was mentioned that the rating matrix has many unobserved values that are not defined. The task is to infer these entries. One solution approach we have seen is via Matrix Factorization using Alternating Least Squares. Why can't we use SVD to solve this problem? Since with the Eckart-Young theorem it is guaranteed that we get the best rank- $k$ approximation of the rating matrix, it seems that unobserved values incur a problem, we cannot just set the unobserved values to $0$ or the mean of the data, but why is that? Does it have to do with the rank-k constraint in the minimization problem $$ A_k = \arg \min_{\mbox{rank}(B)=k} \left\Vert A - B \right\Vert_F^2 $$ because with the rank constrained it is a non-convex problem and Eckart-Young theorem does not guarantee the best rank- $k$ approximation anymore if there are unobserved values in $A$ ?","['svd', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'non-convex-optimization', 'optimization']"

Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be an open subset and let $f:U \to \mathbb{R}^m$ . We say that $f$ is totally differentiable at $a \in U$ if there exists a linear function $D_{a}f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ such that the following holds. $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{||f(x)-f(a)-D_{a}f(x-a)||}{||x-a||} = 0$ We call $D_{a}f$ the total derivative of $f$ at $a$ . My question concerns how we then define the derivative function. For the familiar case in which $n=m=1$ , this is simple since the total derivative reduces to just $(D_{a}f)(b) = \big(\frac{df}{dx}\big{\rvert}_a\big)b$ for all $b \in \mathbb{R}$ . Here, $\frac{df}{dx}\big{\rvert}_a$ denotes the usual definition of the derivative of $f$ at $a$ . We then define the derivative function $f':U \to \mathbb{R}$ as $f'(y) := \frac{df}{dx}\big{\rvert}_y$ for all $y \in U$ . Let us now consider the case when $m=1$ . Representing the action of $D_{a}f$ via the Jacobian matrix, we have $(D_{a}f)(b) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_1}}\big{\rvert}_a & \cdots & \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_n}}\big{\rvert}_a

b_n

If $a_1=a_2\neq a_3=a_4$ , then $\omega_{12},\omega_{34}$ are constant; and changing to isoclinic coordinates $(\omega_{12}\pm\omega_{34}),(\omega_{13}\mp\omega_{24}),(\omega_{14}\pm\omega_{23})$ shows that the solution is a pair of circles (with different frequencies, in the ratio of $(\omega_{12}+\omega_{34})/(\omega_{12}-\omega_{34})$ ). If $a_1=a_2\neq a_3\neq a_4\neq a_1$ , then $\omega_{12}$ is constant. The other five are still non-linearly related. There are easily found particular solutions with some other $\omega_{ij}$ being constant or $0$ . In general, if we assume $\omega_{14}=\omega_{24}=\omega_{34}=0$ , then this reduces to the classical problem in 3D, which can be solved with Jacobi's elliptic functions (or geometrically by intersecting ellipsoids ). This is because $$\text{sn}'=\text{cn}\cdot\text{dn}$$ $$\text{cn}'=-\text{sn}\cdot\text{dn}$$ $$\text{dn}'=-m\cdot\text{sn}\cdot\text{cn}.$$ But can the full 4D problem (with or without $a_1=a_2$ ) be solved with elliptic functions? Of course I'm also interested in the $n$ -dimensional generalization. ...It appears that the differential equations are not Lipschitz-continuous, so it's not clear that they have solutions for all $t$ . (Compare with $dy/dt=y^2$ .) But this is helped by conservation of energy $(a_1^2+a_2^2)\omega_{12}^2+(a_1^2+a_3^2)\omega_{13}^2+\cdots$ ; the equations are Lipschitz-continuous on this restricted domain (an ellipsoid), so we do have existence and uniqueness of solutions for all $t$ . Still working on the $a_1=a_2$ case, I tried variation of parameters, based on the linear part (with $\omega_{12}$ as a factor). With the following definitions, $$A=\frac{a_1^2-a_3^2}{a_1^2+a_3^2},\quad B=\frac{a_1^2-a_4^2}{a_1^2+a_4^2},\quad C=\frac{a_3^2-a_4^2}{a_3^2+a_4^2}$$ $$M = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -A\omega_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ A\omega_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -B\omega_{12} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & B\omega_{12} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$ $$\begin{bmatrix} \omega_{13} \\ \omega_{23} \\ \omega_{14} \\ \omega_{24} \\ \omega_{34} \end{bmatrix} = \exp(tM) \begin{bmatrix} u_{13} \\ u_{23} \\ u_{14} \\ u_{24} \\ u_{34} \end{bmatrix}$$ $$\theta=(B-A)\omega_{12}t$$ the equation becomes $$\frac{d}{dt} \begin{bmatrix} u_{13} \\ u_{23} \\ u_{14} \\ u_{24} \\ u_{34} \end{bmatrix} = \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} Au_{14}u_{34} \\ Au_{24}u_{34} \\ -Bu_{13}u_{34} \\ -Bu_{23}u_{34} \\ C(u_{13}u_{14}+u_{23}u_{24}) \end{bmatrix} + \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} -Au_{24}u_{34} \\ Au_{14}u_{34} \\ -Bu_{23}u_{34} \\ Bu_{13}u_{34} \\ C(u_{23}u_{14}-u_{13}u_{24}) \end{bmatrix}.$$ (This is pointless if $\omega_{12}=0$ .)","['nonlinear-system', 'elliptic-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'rotations']"

3282596,"Can we write explicitly the Euler-Lagrange equation of the ""pullback functional"" $E(f)=\int_M f^*\omega$?","$\newcommand{\Cof}{\text{Cof}}$ $\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}$ Let $M,N$ be smooth oriented manifolds, M compact, $\partial N=\emptyset$ . Let $\omega \in \Omega^m(N)$ be closed . ( $m=\dim M$ ). I don't assume that $\dim M=\dim N$ . Consider the functional $E:C^{\infty}(M,N) \to \mathbb{R}$ , defined by $E(f)=\int_M f^*\omega$ . Can we obtain an ""explicit"" form of its Euler-Lagrange equation? I imagine something of the form $\Phi_{\omega}(f)=0$ , where $\Phi_{\omega}$ is some second order differential operator (which depends on $\omega$ ). One idea I have is to introduce more structure , e.g. endow $M$ and $N$ with Riemannian metrics $g_M,g_N$ . Now we might be able to find a ""metric-dependent"" formulation of the Euler-Lagrange equation. (Even though our functional does not depend on the Riemannian  structures, of course). More specifically, let $V \in \Gamma(f^*TN)$ be compactly supported in the interior $M^o$ , and let $f_t$ be a variation of $f$ satisfying $\left. \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \right|_{t=0} f_t=V$ . My goal is to express $$  \left. \frac{d}{dt} \right|_{t=0} E(f_t)=\int_M \langle V,\Phi_{\omega,g_M,g_N}(f)\rangle Vol_M,$$ where $\Phi_{\omega,g_M,g_N}:C^{\infty}(M,N) \to \Gamma(f^*TN)$ is some (second order) differential operator, which depends on $\omega$ and on the metrics $g_M,g_N$ . Actually, since only the metric on $N$ appears in $\langle V,\Phi_{\omega,g_M,g_N}(f)\rangle$ , $\Phi_{\omega,g_M,g_N}$ depends ""in essence"" only on $g_N$ ; however, $g_M$ may ""get in"" in a way which ""cancels itself"". (See example below). Perhaps something non-trivial can be said at least when $\omega$ is parallel (w.r.t the Levi-Civita connection) or harmonic? Comment: I know that $E$ is a null-Lagrangian, i.e. that every map satisfies its E-L equation. (This follows from the fact that I assumed that $d\omega=0$ and that the variation field is compactly supported in the interior; i.e. the variation do not change the values of the map on boundary $\partial M$ ). However, it does not mean that the E-L equation is ""trivial"" i.e. $0=0$ . See the example below. The first task is to find an expression for $\left. \frac{d}{dt} \right|_{t=0} f_t^*\omega$ where $f_t$ is some variation of $f$ . Here are two attempts: First attempt: Set $f_t=\phi_t \circ f$ , where $\phi_t \in \text{Diff}(N)$ . If $\left. \frac{\partial  \phi_t}{\partial t} \right|_{t=0}=X$ , then $V=X \circ f$ . Then $f_t^* \omega=f^* \phi_t^*  \omega$ , so $$\left. \frac{d}{dt} \right|_{t=0} f_t^*\omega=f^*L_X\omega,$$ and $$ \left. \frac{d}{dt} \right|_{t=0} E(f_t) =\int_M f^*L_X\omega=\int_M f^*d(\iota_X \omega).$$ Note that since $V=X \circ f$ , then $f(p_1)=f(p_2) \Rightarrow V(p_1)=V(p_2)$ , so if $f$ is not injective, not every variation field $V  \in \Gamma(f^*TN)$ can be expressed as $V=X \circ f$ , for some $X \in \Gamma(TN)$ . I don't know how to pass from here to something of the form $\langle X,\Phi(f) \rangle $ . Second attempt: We now take $f_t=f  \circ \psi_t$ , where $\psi_t \in \text{Diff}(M)$ . If $\left. \frac{\partial \psi_t}{\partial t} \right|_{t=0} =X \in \Gamma(TM)$ , then $V=df \circ X$ . (This means that if $df_p$ is not surjective not every $V$ can be realized in this way). Then $f_t^* \omega= \psi_t^*  f^*\omega$ , so $$\left. \frac{d}{dt} \right|_{t=0} f_t^*\omega=L_Xf^*\omega,$$ and $$ \left. \frac{d}{dt} \right|_{t=0} E(f_t) =\int_M L_Xf^*\omega=\int_M d(\iota_X f^*\omega).$$ Again, I don't know how to pass from here to something of the form $\langle X,\Phi(f) \rangle $ . Here is an example for the kind of 'explicit' expression I am looking for: Let $M=\Omega $ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , and $N=\mathbb{R}^n$ , both endowed with the Euclidean metrics, and set $\omega= \text{Vol}_{\mathbb{R}^n}$ . Then $$ E(f)=\int_{\Omega} f^*\text{Vol}_{\R^n}=\int_{\Omega}  \det df \text{Vol}_{\R^n}, $$ and so writing $f_t=f+tV$ for some $V:\Omega \to \R^n$ , we obtain $$\left. \frac{d}{dt} \right|_{t=0} E(f_t)=\int_{\Omega} \left. \frac{d}{dt} \right|_{t=0}  \det df_t=\int_{\Omega} \left. \frac{d}{dt} \right|_{t=0}  \det (df+tdV)=\int_{\Omega} \langle \Cof df,dV \rangle=\int_{\Omega} \langle \text{div} \Cof df,V \rangle,$$ so the Euler-Lagrange equation is given by $$ \text{div} \Cof df=0,$$ where $\Cof df$ is the cofactor matrix of $df$ , and the divergence here is taken row-by-row. This special case can be generalized to the case where $M,N$ are equidimensional Riemannian manifolds, and $\omega=\text{Vol}_N$ is the Riemannian volume form of $N$ . (admittedly, here $\omega$ itself depends upon the target metric $g_N$ , which is not exactly the context I presented in this question so far, where the metrics $g_M,g_N$ and the form $\omega$ are chosen independently). The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation is $\delta (\Cof df)=0$ , where $\delta$ and $\Cof df$ are natural generalizations of the cofactor matrix and the divergence operator to Riemannian settings. For more details about this see this answer of mine. This in fact gives an infinite family of equations, that any map satisfies-one equation for every two metrics we choose.","['riemannian-geometry', 'calculus-of-variations', 'euler-lagrange-equation', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"

3282795,Calculation of alarm level for a signal detection in Poisson distributed noise,"I am trying out my luck with the first post here... Well, to start off I have a problem, and I am not really sure about the solution. I hope that someone might chime in with suggestions.. We have an ionizing radiation detector. It is sampling the radiation induced counts each second. The counts in the detector are Poisson distributed. Then, a source might pass the detector giving rise to the number of counts in the detector for some time. We want to have a threshold for counts in the detector, which when passed would indicate that there is a source nearby. The question is whether we are correctly estimating the threshold for a certain detection criteria set for a given number of false alarms. For example, given, that the total survey time is one hour there are 3600 individual measurements in total. We want to set the threshold of detection to 1 false alarm per hour or 1 in every 3600 measurements. Due to the fact, that the counts in the detector are Poisson distributed around the mean of $\lambda_\text{bkg}$ , we can estimate the threshold level $N_\text{alarm}$ using Poisson CDF for a probability of $P_\text{alarm}=1-\frac{1}{3600}$ . 
To do that, I am using qpois(lambda,p) function in R. As far as I understand it should yield correct alarm level. Testing the results using a number of simulated one-hour measurements yields average probability of any number of alarms of around 25% for a given one-hour survey. For a number of alarms greater than one, the probability is around 3%. Is this correct?

This is a lemma that is used in Baire's category theory. Definitions: $A \subset X$ is nowhere dense if $\text{int}\left(\bar{A}\right) = \emptyset$ . A topologial space is called $T_1$ if for each pair $a$ , $b$ of distinct points of $X$ , there are open set $U$ and $V$ in $X$ such that $a \in U, a \not \in V, b \not \in U$ and $b \in V$ . A topologial space is called regular if it is a $T_1$ space and for each closed subset $C$ and each point $a$ not in $C$ , there exist disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ in $X$ such that $a \in U$ and $C \subset V$ . My proof so far: $\Rightarrow: $ Assume that $A \subset X$ is nowhere dense. If $X$ is empty, then the statement trivially holds. So assume that $X$ is not empty.
If $\bar{A} = X$ then $\text{int}\left( \bar{A} \right) = X \not = \emptyset$ , which contradicts the assumption that $A$ is nowhere dense. So we have that $\bar{A} \not = X$ . So there exists an $a$ not in $\bar{A}$ . Since any metric space is regular and $\bar{A}$ is closed we obtain an open ball $B_a(r)$ such that $B_a(r)$ and $\bar{A}$ are disjoint. But then also $B_a(r)$ and $A$ are disjoint. Now we note that $\overline{B_a(r/2)} \subset B_a(r)$ . So we find that $\overline{B_a(r/2)}$ is disjoint from $A$ . The other direction I don't fully have. I made a start. $\Leftarrow: $ Assume that each non-empty open set in $X$ contains an open ball whose closure is disjoint from $A$ . And for a contradiction assume that $A$ is not nowhere dense. Then $\text{int}\left( \bar{A} \right) \not = \emptyset$ . So by the assumption there exists an open ball $B$ with ${B} \subset \text{int}\left( \bar{A} \right)$ and $\overline{B}  \cap A = \emptyset$ .

And we know for our particular sequence $(s_{n})_{n}=:s$ that $\sum_{n \in \mathbb N}s_{n}t_{n}<\infty$ for any $t\in c_{0}$ so similarly we get a functional: $l_{s}:c_{0}\to\mathbb K, t \mapsto \sum_{n \in \mathbb N}s_{n}t_{n}$ by the isometric isometry of $J$ there must exist a $k\in \ell^{1}$ so that: $\sum_{n \in \mathbb N}k_{n}t_{n}=(Jk)(t)=l_{s}(t)=\sum_{n \in \mathbb N}s_{n}t_{n}$ . I am unsure whether I can now say that $k=s$ ? If I can, this would then imply $s \in \ell^{1}$ Any ideas?","['isometry', 'lp-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'riesz-representation-theorem']"
3282960,Logic behind Möbius transformation,"So I am attempting to get a grasp on Möbius transformations. Specifically, I'm trying to understand the logic and reasoning behind using them to map certain subsets of the complex plane into others. The following problem is from Lars Ahlfors, ""Complex analysis"", 1966.(p.83). Find the Mobius transformation which carries the circle $|z|=2$ into $|z+1|=1$ , the point $-2$ into the origin, and the origin into $i$ . Graphically: Since i know where the two specific points $z_1=-2$ and $z_2=0$ are being mapped, I can set up the equation: $$ \frac{f(z)-f(z_1)}{f(z)-f(z_2)}=K\frac{z-z_1}{z-z_2} $$ Which yields: $\frac{f(z)}{f(z)-i}=K\frac{z+2}{z}$ , or equivalently: $$[\ast] \quad \quad f(z)=\frac{(-iK)z+(-2iK)}{(1-K)z+(-2K)}$$ Now, If I knew where one more point was mapped, I would be able to determine the coefficient $K$ , and thus $f$ . This is the point where I do not know how to reason to get past. My thought was ""try $f(2)=-2$ "", since this would preserve the diametrically opposite points. The resulting transformation does however not map the circle to the circle. Therefore, to figure out the answer, I put a complex number $K$ in geogebra, defined the function $f$ as in $[\ast]$ , put a bunch of points $A,B,C,D,E$ evenly on the circle $|z|=2$ , and varied the parameter $K$ until $f(A),f(B),f(C),f(D),f(E)$ all ligned up on the circle $|z+1|=1$ . This gave the result $K=-i$ , which means that the answer to the problem is $$f(z)=\frac{iz+2i}{2z+2}$$ I do not understand how I would have figured this out by calculation, since I seem to miss some crucial information... I did however figure out that if i choose $f(-2i)=-1+i$ for my third point, I get the correct transformation, but I do not know why as I found this by trial and error....

3282986,Groups where no elements commute except for the trivial cases,"Let $G$ be a group. Write $e$ for its neutral element and write $\langle g\rangle$ for the subgroup generated by an element $g \in G$ . Assume that $G$ has the following properties: For all $g\in G\setminus\{e\}$ and $h\in G\setminus \langle g \rangle$ we have $gh \neq hg$ . Property 1. is non-vacuous (as it would be e.g. for $G=\{e\}$ ). Do such groups exist? If so, do they have any interesting/important properties? Note that this is a follow-up to this very similar question in response to one of the comments there.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'finite-groups']"
3283004,Existence of a global section for principal polarization $\mathcal L$ on abelian variety $X/k$.,"In Huybrecht's book on Fourier-Mukai transforms the following argument is used in a proof Since $(X,\mathcal L)$ is a principally polarized abelian variety one has a unique global section $s : \mathcal O_X \to \mathcal L$ . The only things that seem to be used here is that a $\mathcal L$ is a principal polarization, so an ample line bundle such that $\chi(\mathcal L) = 1$ . This argument seems very brief to me. Can anyone explain to me this argument in more detail? edit This seems to follow from the fact (Mumford, Abelian Varieties) that $\chi(\mathcal L) = \text{dim}_k\text{H}^0(X,\mathcal L)$ (of which I have no proof).","['derived-categories', 'algebraic-geometry']"
3283050,Structure of the sheaf $\frac{K(C)}{\mathcal{L}_D}$,"I have a question about a sheaf and his stalks.
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be $\frac{K(C)}{\mathcal{L}_D}$ ( $K(C)$ is the function field of $C$ and $\mathcal{L}_D$ is the invertible sheaf associated to a divisor D) over a smooth complete curve $C$ . $\mathcal{A}$ has the following propriety: For every $P \in C$ , for every $U_{_P}$ open neighborhood of P if $s$ is a section of $\mathcal{A}(U_{_P})$ exists an open neighborhood of $P$ $U^{'}_{s,P}\subset U_{_P}$ such that $s_{\mid_{U^{'}_{s,P}-\{P\}}}=0$ . Is possible to say that $\mathcal{A}(C)$ (global section of the sheaf) can be identified with $\oplus_{P\in C} \mathcal{A}_P$ (direct sum of the stalks)? $\textit{I've tried to prove the fact but i didn't succeed, maybe i wrong the approach:}$ $\textit{My idea is to create a sheaf $\mathcal{A}_d(U):=\oplus_{P\in U}\mathcal{A}_P$ and then prove that this is isomorphic to $\mathcal{A}$}.$ $\textit{In this way i found two problems.}$ $\textit{First i was not able to prove that the gluing axiom on the sheaf $\mathcal{A}_d$ holds}$ . $\textit{Second i am not sure that if i have an isomophism between the shaves}$ $\textit{i can use it to prove an isomorphism between the global section.}$ (The only thing i have in mind is that it should came from the fact that the first chomology group of the sheaf $\mathcal{A}_d$ is trivial) Someone could give me any suggestion please?","['algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory']"

3283077,$G$ is a finite group s.t. $(ab)^p=a^pb^p$; $P$ is its $p$-Sylow subgroup. Then there exists $N \unlhd G$ such that $N \cap P = (e)$ and $NP=G$.,"This is problem 2.12.15  in Herstein's Topics in Algebra , second edition. The full problem is Let $G$ be a finite group in which $(ab)^p=a^pb^p$ for every $a,b \in G$ , where $p$ is a prime dividing $o(G)$ . Prove (a) The $p$ -Sylow subgroup of $G$ is normal in $G$ . $^*$ (b) If $P$ is the $p$ -Sylow subgroup of $G$ , then there exists a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ with $P \cap N = (e)$ and $PN=G$ . (c) $G$ has a nontrivial center. I have done part (a) but am stuck at part (b). I have tried different approaches, but they all seem ineffective. I should also say that, at this point in the book, Herstein hasn't even formally introduced direct products, only the Sylow theorems. How am I supposed to solve this? The next problem, problem 16, basically asks to prove a result called Burnside's p-complement theorem or possibly another called the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem (according to other threads on this website), but that's a double-starred problem, so I was thinking that there must be a simpler solution to this one-star problem.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'finite-groups', 'sylow-theory']"
