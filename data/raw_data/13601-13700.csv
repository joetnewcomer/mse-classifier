107478,Basic properties of the point-to-set distance function,"Let $X$ be a normed vector space, $x\in X$ and $Z\subseteq X$. Then we define the point-to-set distance function as:
$$
\|x\|_Z = \inf_{z\in Z} \| x-z\|
$$
I use the notation $\|\cdot\|_Z$ for convenience without implying that the operation is a norm. Assuming that $Z$ is convex we may not conclude that:
$$
\|x+y\|_Z \leq \|x\|_Z + \|y\|_Z
$$
What sort of properties should $Z$ possess so that the triangle inequality holds for all $x\in X$? For example, $Z$ being a singleton brings about the desired inequality but I'm looking for a less trivial example. Additionally, let $A\in M_n(\mathbb{R})$ be a matrix and let $Z\neq X$. I noticed that we may define: $$
\|A\|_Z:= \sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n,x\notin Z}\frac{\|Ax\|_Z}{\|x\|_Z}
$$ while $\|A\|_X:=0$. Then, it should be true that:
$$
\|Ax\|_Z \leq \|A\|_Z\cdot\|x\|_Z
$$ So, this is one norm-like property for $\|\cdot\|_Z$. What other properties of $\|\cdot\|_Z$ can we deduce based on assumed properties of $Z$? Update: As Davide Giraudo pointed out, the triangle inequality holds true in case $Z$ is a linear subspace of $X$. It seems that it holds for convex cones too (for nonconvex cones it's easy to find a counter example on the plane). Let us assume that $Z$ is a convex cone. Then: $$
\|x+y\|_Z=\inf_{z\in Z}\|x+y-z\|\leq \|x+y-(z_1+z_2)\|
$$ where $z_1,z_2\in Z$ and we proceed as in David's answer. Here, we used the fact that whenever $Z$ is a convex cone, then $z_1,z_2\in Z \Rightarrow z_1+z_2\in Z$ so any vector in $Z$ can be decomposed into a sum of vectors of $Z$ and vice versa. Question: Would be nice to identify other classes of sets for which the induced point-to-set distance satisfies the triangle inequality.","['convex-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
107494,badly approximated numbers on the real line form a meagre set,"Let $S$ be the set of real numbers $x$ such that there exist infinitely many (reduced) rational numbers $p/q$ such that $$\left\vert x-\frac{p}{q}\right\vert <\frac{1}{q^8}.$$

  objective functions have no regularity for an algorithm to exploit.
  Given an incompressible objective function, there is no basis for

  better than most, the result is happenstance.[11] I was wondering How shall I understand that a general-purpose universal optimizer

does? What differences are between universal and almost universal? Do the last two sentences in bold contradict each other? Do ""an

107611,Canonical isomorphism between $\mathfrak{so}(3)$ and $\mathbb R^3$ with vector cross product,"There is a well-known isomorphism between the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(3)$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$ which maps the Lie bracket to the vector cross product. It looks like $$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -z &y\\
z & 0 & -x\\
-y & x & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix}.
$$ There is a more geometric description to this isomorphism, which in broad strokes involves identifying $\mathbb{R}^3$ with $\Lambda^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ via the Hodge star, and identifying $\mathfrak{so}(3)\subseteq \operatorname{End}(\mathbb{R}^3)\cong\mathbb{R}^3\otimes(\mathbb{R}^3)^*$ with $\Lambda^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$. If you work in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with its canonical basis, canonical inner product, and canonical orientation, it's easy to see that these isomorphisms yield the specified result. Now I'm trying to check the details of these identifications for a general vector space (with dim = 3 injected into the argument when necessary), giving all the isomorphisms explicitly and without choosing a basis. I found this excellent answer by Qiaochu Yuan to be helpful for some one of the steps. Let me walk through the steps, as I see them: First let's set notation. Let $V$ be an arbitrary real vector space with inner product $g$ and volume form $\Omega$. The automorphism group $SO(V)=\{O\in \operatorname{Aut}(V)\mid g(Ov,Ow)=g(v,w)\}$ has Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(V)=\{X\in \operatorname{End}(V)\mid g(Xv,w)+g(v,Xw)=0\}$ Therefore the map defined by $\tilde{\alpha}(X)=\operatorname{eval}(\flat\circ X\otimes\operatorname{id})\colon v\otimes w\mapsto g(Xv,w)$ is skew-symmetric. Here $\operatorname{eval}$ is the evaluation map $V\otimes V^*$ which takes $v\otimes\sigma\mapsto \sigma(v)$, and $\flat$ is the canonical isomorphism $V\to V^*$ induced by the non-degenerate bilinear form $g$, given by $u\mapsto (v\mapsto g(u,v))$. Since $\tilde{\alpha}(X)\colon V\otimes V\to \mathbb{R}$ is skew-symmetric, it factors to a map $\alpha(X)\colon\Lambda^2(V)\to\mathbb{R}$. I.e. $\alpha(X)\in\Lambda^2V^*$. Now apply the inverse map $\sharp\colon V^*\to V$ to the first tensor factor, we have $\beta(X)=(\sharp\wedge\operatorname{id})\circ\alpha(X)\in V\wedge V^*$. To make this construction a little more concrete, observe that given a one parameter group of rotations in the plane fixed by two vectors $v,w$, one can check that the corresponding Lie group element is $\beta(X)=w\wedge v^\flat$. Apply $\sharp$ to the second tensor factor to get an element of the standard exterior algebra $\gamma(X)=(\operatorname{id}\wedge\sharp)\circ\beta(X)\in\Lambda^2V$. Apply the Hodge star operator to get an element of the vector space $\delta(X)=*\gamma(X)\in V.$ Check that $\delta$ is an isomorphism of Lie algebras $\delta([X,Y])=\delta(X)\times\delta(Y)=*(\delta(X)\wedge\delta(Y))$ (Clearly it's linear. I suppose it should also be verified that $\delta$ is bijective) So I have several problems. Step 2 above seems very convoluted and inelegant, with all the raising and lowering operators just to check whether something is an antisymmetric map. Step 2 is not just convoluted, but of dubious construction. Usually one considers the exterior power of a vector space with itself, not a vector space wedged with its dual space. That construction seems nonstandard to me, so I'm in unfamiliar territory and wonder whether this is the wrong path. I can't really see how to do step 6. I can't push the Lie bracket through all these opaque constructions. The $\operatorname{eval}$ map used in step 2 is also somewhat mysterious, at least in one direction. That is, there's really only a canonical injection $\operatorname{eval}\colon V\otimes V^*\to \operatorname{End}(V)$ given by $v\otimes\sigma\mapsto (w\mapsto \sigma(w)v)$. In the case that $V$ is not finite dimensional, this will not be an isomorphism and does not have an inverse. In the finite dimensional case, we do have an inverse, any endomorphism can be written as a product of vectors and dual vectors, but not canonically. Mapping $\mathfrak{so}(V)$ to $\Lambda^2(V)$ seems to require as an intermediate step mapping $\operatorname{End}(V)$ to $V\otimes V^*$. Can this be done canonically? Given the concerns about the direction of the map $V\otimes V^*\to \operatorname{End}(V)$, perhaps I should try to go the other way, but I can't make any progress that way either, because I don't know any identity for the Hodge star operator that will allow me to evaluate expressions like $*(X\wedge Y)$. How does the Hodge star operator interact with the wedge product? Those are the issues I'm running into with my approach. I had somehow expected the I'd appreciate any resolutions to those issues, or alternatively if there is a better approach to this question, or some reason why the question itself is not a good one, I'd love to hear about it. Thanks.","['linear-algebra', 'lie-algebras']"
107617,An infinite subset of a countable set is countable,"In my book, it proves that an infinite subset of a coutnable set is countable. But not all the details are filled in, and I've tried to fill in all the details below. Could someone tell me if what I wrote below is valid? Let $S$ be an infinite subset of a countable set $T$. Since $T$ is countable, there exists a bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow T$. And $S \subseteq T = \{ f(n) \ | \ n \in \mathbb{N} \}$. Let $n_{1}$ be the smallest positive integer such that $f(n_{1}) \in S$. And continue where $n_{k}$ is the smallest positive integer greater than $n_{k-1}$ such that $f(n_{k}) \in S$. And because $S$ is infinite, we continue forever. Now consider the function $\beta : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow S$ which sends $k \rightarrow f(n_{k})$. So in order for $S$ to be countable, $\beta$ would have to be a bijection. $\beta$ is injective since if $f(n_{k}) = f(n_{j})$, then $n_{k} = n_{j}$ because $f$ is injective. We also can conclude $k = j$ because the various $n_{i}$ chosen were strictly increasing. Edit: $\beta$ also needs to be surjective. So for every $r \in S$ there exists a $q \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\beta(q) = f(n_{q}) = r$. We know that $f^{-1}(r) \in \{n_{1}, n_{2}, ..., n_{k} ... \}$, so we can let $f^{-1}(r) = n_{d}$. Thus $\beta(d) = f(n_{d}) = r$.","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"

  & t = x\cdot u  \cr 
  & dt = x\cdot du \cr} $$ So this is produces: $$\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to 0} \int\limits_1^{\frac{1}{x}} {\frac{{f\left( {xu} \right)}}{{{u^{\alpha  + 1}}}}du} $$ I then thought: ""Well, if $f$ is continuous in the closed interval, then it is also uniformly continuous, so I can assume $$\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to 0} \int\limits_1^{\frac{1}{x}} {\frac{{f\left( {xu} \right)}}{{{u^{\alpha  + 1}}}}du}  = f\left( 0 \right)\int\limits_1^\infty  {\frac{{du}}{{{u^{\alpha  + 1}}}}}  = \frac{1}{\alpha }f\left( 0 \right)$$ This turned out to be true. However, I wasn't very comfortable with such ""move"".

Let $P$ be the statement that $$\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to 0} \int\limits_1^{\frac{1}{x}} {\frac{{f\left( {xu} \right)}}{{{u^{\alpha  + 1}}}}du}  = \frac{{f\left( 0 \right)}}{\alpha }$$ Then $P$ is true if and only if $$ \forall \epsilon  > 0\exists \delta  > 0$$ Such that if $$\left| x \right| < \delta $$ then $$ \left| {\int\limits_1^{\frac{1}{x}} {\frac{{f\left( {xu} \right)}}{{{u^{\alpha  + 1}}}}du}  - \frac{{f\left( 0 \right)}}{\alpha }} \right| < \epsilon $$ But then $$\left| {\int\limits_1^{\frac{1}{x}} {\frac{{f\left( {xu} \right) - f\left( 0 \right)}}{{{u^{\alpha  + 1}}}}du}  + \int\limits_1^{\frac{1}{x}} {\frac{{f\left( 0 \right)}}{{{u^{\alpha  + 1}}}}du - \frac{{f\left( 0 \right)}}{\alpha }} } \right| < $$ $$\left| {\int\limits_1^{\frac{1}{\delta }} {\frac{{f\left( {xu} \right) - f\left( 0 \right)}}{{{u^{\alpha  + 1}}}}du}  + \int\limits_1^{\frac{1}{\delta }} {\frac{{f\left( 0 \right)}}{{{u^{\alpha  + 1}}}}du - \frac{{f\left( 0 \right)}}{\alpha }} } \right| \leqslant $$ $$\varepsilon \frac{{1 - {\delta ^\alpha }}}{\alpha } + f\left( 0 \right)\frac{{1 - {\delta ^\alpha }}}{\alpha } - \frac{{f\left( 0 \right)}}{\alpha } < $$ And since $$\frac{{1 - {\delta ^\alpha }}}{\alpha } < \frac{1}{\alpha }$$
$$\epsilon \frac{{1 - {\delta ^\alpha }}}{\alpha } + f\left( 0 \right)\frac{{1 - {\delta ^\alpha }}}{\alpha } - \frac{{f\left( 0 \right)}}{\alpha } < \frac{\epsilon }{\alpha } < \epsilon $$","['integration', 'limits']"

107688,Determining transformation sending $|z|=2$ to $|z+1|=1$.,"I'm trying to teach myself complex analysis, and am reading about linear fractional transformations. I want to find the transformation carrying the circle $|z|=2$ into $|z+1|=1$, $-2$ into the origin, and the origin into $i$. My text states that the transformation is determined by prescribing a point $z_1$ on circle $C$ to correspond to a point $w_1$ on $C'$, and a point $z_2$ not on $C$ to correspond to $w_2$ not on $C'$. Then $z^\ast_2$ corresponds to $w^\ast_2$, the symmetric points of $z_2$ and $w_2$ in $C$ and $C'$, respectively. Then the transformation is obtained from the relation $(w,w_1,w_2,w^\ast_2)=(z,z_1,z_2,z^\ast_2)$ (those are cross-ratios). I let $C$ be the circle $|z|=1$, and $C'$ be $|z+1|=1$. Then by the notions above $z_1=-2$, $w_1=0$, $z_2=0$, $w_2=i$. I calculate $z^\ast_2=\infty$ and $w^\ast_2=\frac{-1+i}{2}$. So following what I've read, I have $(w,0,i,(-1+i)/2)=(z,-2,0,\infty)$. I don't understand how to gather the explicit form of the desired linear fractional transformation is from this, since $w$ and $z$ seem unknown to me. Could someone please explain what the transformation is now? Thank you.",['complex-analysis']

107715,The definition of the logarithm.,"One usually gets several definitions of the logarithm along his studies. You might be first introduced to the exponential and then told that the logarithm is its inverse. You might be given
$$\log x = \int\limits_1^x {\frac{{du}}{u}} $$ Like Landau does. Let $k = 2^n$, then:
$$\log x =\mathop {\lim }\limits_{k \to \infty } k\left( {\root k \of x  - 1} \right)$$ And last, if you ever read, Euler famously wrote:
$$ - \log x = \frac{{1 - {x^0}}}{0}$$ Landau's definition (although I find it the most usefull to work with) really baffled me untill just now. Since
$$\int\limits_1^x {\frac{{du}}{{{u^{\alpha  + 1}}}}}  = \frac{{{x^{ - \alpha }} - 1}}{{ - \alpha }}$$ Then being $\frac{1}{k} = -\alpha$ one hopes to have: $$\mathop {\lim }\limits_{\alpha  \to 0} \int\limits_1^x {\frac{{du}}{{{u^{\alpha  + 1}}}}}  = \int\limits_1^x {\frac{{du}}{u}}  = \log x = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{k \to \infty } k\left( {\root k \of x  - 1} \right)$$ How can one justify taking the limit before integration?

107744,Cardinality of Sigma Algebra,"I had some doubt with my proof, but I'll list the question here along with the proof: Claim: Show that the cardinality of a finite $\sigma$-algebra $\mathfrak{M}$ on a set $X$ is $2^n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Describe the exponent $n$ in terms of $\sigma$-algebra. Proof: For each member in $\mathfrak{M}$, we can pair it with its complement by properties of $\mathfrak{M}$. This pairing gives a specific partition. Using this idea, we can pick any combination of members of $X$ such that these sets of members of $X$ forms a partition of $X$.  Just observing the collection of partitions of $X$, we consider the partition which has the most cells by superimposing all of the partition on top of each other. So suppose there are $n$ cells for a specific partition of $X$. Let $S$ be the set that contains these $n$ cells. So $\mathcal{P}(S) = 2^n$, where $n$ is the maximum number of cells one can achieve through all possible partition of $X$. From $\mathcal{P}(S)$, we get the other partition of $X$. Hence, $S$ generates $\mathfrak{M}$. On a similar note, there's a question that is similar to the one I am posing: If we are given any infinite ($|\mathfrak{M}| =$ is infinite) $\sigma$-algebra $\mathfrak{M}$ on set $X$, then there is a subset with cardinality of the real numbers $2^{\aleph_{0}}$. Proof: I don't think my argument would work in the infinite case, but I'll give it a go. So I thought that $\mathfrak{M}$ has infinitely many partition of $X$, so if we were to countably infinitely take intersection of the partitions of $X$, we get a countably infinite cells of a partition of $X$. Using the argument by the previous problem, we take the power set of the natural number, which gives us $2^{\aleph_{0}}$. For some reason, I am unsure how this infinite case would work out. -Thanks in advance",['measure-theory']

107767,When do three points determine the same orientation?,"I'm trying to understand the following claim: If $z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4$ are points (as complex numbers) on a circle, then $z_1,z_3,z_4$ and $z_2,z_3,z_4$ determine the same orientation iff $CR(z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4)>0$. Why is this? This was the explanation I tried to explain to myself, but I don't know if it's fully correct, since I make a lot of assumptions to simplify the work. Since the cross ratio is invariant under transformation, we can assume that $z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4$ lie on the real axis. Moreover, we can use a transformation to assume that $z_2=0$, $z_3=1$, and $z_4=2$. Now 
$$
(z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4)=\frac{2(z_1-z_3)}{z_1-z_4}
$$
and so $(z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4)>0$ if any only if $\frac{z_1-z_3}{z_1-z_4}>0$. Now note that for any $z$,
$$
(z,z_1,z_3,z_4)=\frac{(z_1-z_4)z-(z_1-z_4)}{(z_1-z_3)z-2(z_1-z_3)}
$$
and
$$
(z,z_2,z_3,z_4)=\frac{2z-2}{z-2}.
$$
So the determinant of the first transformation is $-(z_1-z_3)(z_1-z_4)$, and that of the latter is $-2$. But $\frac{z_1-1}{z_1-2}>0$ when numerator and denominator have the same sign, that is, either when $z_1>z_3$ and $z_1>z_4$, or when $z_1<z_3$ or $z_1<z_4$, and in either case the determinant is negative. It follows that $\Im(z,z_1,z_3,z_4)$ and $\Im(z,z_2,z_3,z_4)$ always have the same sign, and thus determine the same orientation. Thanks.","['transformational-geometry', 'complex-analysis']"

107841,A condition for the existence of a subgroup of finite index. Trouble understanding the statement of a theorem.,"I'm reading a text on group theory and I've encountered a theorem I can't understand. Here are the statement and the proof (translated from Polish). I believe there must be some mistakes in it, only I don't know how many. I'm changing nothing in the symbols used. Let $H_i$ be subgroups of $G$. Then $$G=\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_i}H_ia_{ij}\implies\exists_i[G:H_i]<\infty.$$ And the proof is this: By induction over $n.$ For $n=1$ it is clear because $$G=\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}Ha_{ij},$$ and so $[G:H_1]\leq n_1.$ Now the step. Let $[G:H_n]=\infty.$ There exists a coset $H_ng$ which is contained in $$\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_i}H_ia_{ij},$$ and so $$H_na_{n_j}\subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_i}H_ia_{ij}g^{-1}a_{n_j}.$$ We treat the element $a_{ij}g^{-1}a_{n_j}$ as $b_{i,j,t},$ where $t$ corresponds to the pair $(n,j).$ Therefore $$\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_n}H_n a_{n_j}\subset\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_t}H_ib_{ijt}. $$ Therefore $$G\subset\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}\bigcup_{j=1}^{s}H_ib_{ij},$$ and the inductive hypothesis gives us that one of these cosets has a finite index. Here ends the proof. I understand very little of this. Most importantly, in the statement of the theorem, $n,$ $n_i$ and $a_{ij}$ are nowhere defined, so I don't even know what is being proven. Secondly, in the proof, there is a number of further undefined symbols. What could $s$ be? What is $a_{n_j}?$ What does it mean that $t$ corresponds to the pair $(n,j)?$ What does it mean that a coset has a finite index? I know that a subgroup may have a finite index, but a coset?

1) Let us use linear algebra and other techniques to put geometry on a firm footing. Let us assume you already know Eucliean geometry and move on to more interesting stuff. These are probably too advanced for me.
2) Let us skip all that complicated postulates/proofs and make geometry fun.  Too easy. When I was in 9th grade Honors Geometry way back in 1981/82 we had a textbook that, as I recall through my foggy memory, was very good and did systematically build up geometry from the propositions (5 of them?).  And it certainly didn't attempt to address Hilbert's contributions to geometry or explain non-Euclidean geometry. Unfortunately, I don't recall the title or author.  I suspect the book was used nationally though and for quite a number of years, so perhaps someone with a better memory than me can provide a title/author.  I do recall it had all the postulates and most major thereoms listed at the end of the book. My motivation is two fold...
1.  Review the material myself in preparation for my advanced texts.
2.  Help my children in a few years when they take geometry. Books I could get for the iPad/Kindle or free books (Google?) would be most appreciatied, but I'm not opposed to killing a tree either :)

I was wondering if there are some counterexamples to confirm the above?

Here $A^k$ is the obvious subset of $\mathbb{Z}^k$ consisting of elements all of whose coordinates are in $A$. This is some delicate question in infinite Ramsey theory.

107945,Diagonalizable matrices with complex values are dense in set of $n\times n$ complex matrices.,"My linear algebra professor proved that Diagonalizable matrices with complex values are dense in set of $n \times n$ complex matrices. He defined a metric (I believe) that was somehow related to the usual metric on $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. Then somehow proved that diagonalizable matrices were dense because for any matrix $A$ if $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$ on an open subset, then $\det(A - \lambda I)$ was the zero polynomial. I Googled around a bit and found some stuff talking about the Zariski topology, and I am not sure this is what I want. Most of what I have found on this topology is much more general than what he was doing. Does anyone know any resources that would explain how to go about proving this statement? Edit: I found out how to prove this the way my professor did. We define the norm of a matrix by
$$ |A| = \max\{|Ax| : |x| = 1 \}.$$
Now we have a distance $d(A, B) < \epsilon$. You can prove that if $(A - B)_{ij} < \epsilon/n$, then $|A - B| < \epsilon$. Let $p(x)$ be the characteristic polynomial of $A$, an $n \times n$ matrix. 
$$p(x) = \prod_1^n (x - x_i) = x^n + (-1)\sigma_1 x^{n - 1} + \cdots + (-1)^n\sigma_n$$
where $\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_n$ are the elementary symmetric polynomials of $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ which are the eigenvalues. The discriminant of the characteristic polynomial is a symmetric polynomial, therefore it can be written in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, which in turn can be written in terms of the entries of the matrix. But since the discriminant is a polynomial, it only has finitely many roots. Therefore for $\epsilon > 0$, by changing the entries of the matrix less than $\epsilon / n$ we can find a new matrix $B$ such that $|B - A| < \epsilon$ and the discriminant is not zero. The discriminant being not zero means $B$ has distinct eigenvalues, thus has a basis of eigenvectors. Therefore, it is diagonalizable. Thus the set of diagonalizable matrices is dense in the set of matrices with respect to that metric.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

108199,Asymptotic Expansion for heat operator $e^{-t\triangle}$,"I'm afraid the question below might turn out to be very stupid - I just don't know how to make sense of two asymptotic expansions, given the heat operator $e^{-t\triangle}$ with $\triangle$ a Laplace type operator on smooth functions over an n-dimensional manifold we have an asymptotic expansion of the kernel
\begin{equation}
\text{k}(e^{-t\triangle}) \backsim \sum_{j \geq 0} c_{\frac{-n - j}{2}} \,t^{\frac{-n - j}{2}}
\end{equation}
and we also have an asymptotic expansion for the trace,
\begin{equation}
\text{Tr}(e^{-t\triangle}) \backsim \sum_{j \geq 0} c_{\frac{-n - j}{2}} \,t^{\frac{-n - j}{2}}
\end{equation} Now, where is the difference in these two expansions ? I realize this question suggests I don't know enough about both the kernel and the definition of the trace - which is absolutely true. The problem though is I don't know how to find an answer since all sources I have go on a large detour on how to construct the heat kernel, and on general definitions and properties of trace structures on operator algebras. I am totally aware I need to eventually understand these concepts, what I hope for with this question is to get a first idea in order to proceed. If that's not possible I'd also appreciate a reference to literature that starts at a low level so that I can get an overview. Hope this makes sense, thanks a lot for your help!","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'operator-theory', 'differential-geometry']"
108220,Hilbert Schmidt operators as an ideal in operators.,"Let $H$ be a Hilbert space. For $\{e_n\}$ an orthonormal basis of $H$, we call $T\in B(H)$, a Hilbert Schmidt operator if

$
\|ST\|_2 \leq \|S\|_{B(H)} \|T\|_2
