3966451,Finding a periodic bijection on the set of bitstrings,"Let $S$ be the set of bitstrings of length $n$ . For $x\in S$ , let $W(x)$ be the Hamming weight of $x$ i.e. number of ones in $x$ . I am trying to find a bijection $f:S\to S$ which maps bitstrings in the following periodic manner. Bitstrings of low weight are mapped to bitstrings of medium weight. Then bitstrings of medium weight are mapped to bitstrings of high weight and finally the high weight ones are mapped back to low weight ones. My attempt: Consider $x\in S$ . If we take the $XOR$ of the $n-$ bits of $x$ , append the result to $x$ and pop the first bit of $x$ to get a bitstring say $y$ . Then let $f(x)=y$ defines a bijection. But this bijection doesn't satisfy the above requirements because $W(f(x))=W(x)+1$ if $W(x)$ is odd and the first bit of $x$ is $0$ and $W(f(x))=W(x)-1$ if $W(x)$ is even and the first bit of $x$ is $1$ . So with this $f$ , we move up/down a weight class depending on whether the current weight is odd/even and it's clearly not periodic. So instead of moving up/down, I would like a bijection that only goes up weight classes initially, then we reach medium weight at which point we need to go down weight classes as described above. I've gotten very helpful answers on other types of bijections on $S$ here before. This is a part of a larger problem I'm working on: Random walk on the set of bitstrings and this $f$ helps me shuffle the bitstrings so that the random walk converges to its stationary distribution faster. EDIT: Just a note on the comment below by Ross. If we map weight $1$ strings to weight $2$ strings and so on and keep the remaining strings mapped to themselves, then a whole lot of strings do not change weight because they are mapped to themselves. I am trying to avoid that. The strings don't have to change weight only by $1$ . Also, a lot of strings need to change weight as opposed to the previous example.","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

3966457,Scale parameter definition,"I have seen two definitions of scale parameter of a distribution: Let $X$ be random variable and $\{{P_{\theta, X }: \theta \in \Theta \subset \mathbb{R}\}}$ be a parametric family of distribution of $X$ indexed by $\theta$ $$1)~~ \theta \text{   is a scale parameter iff} \rightarrow \text{ the distribution of } cX \text{ is in } \{{P_{\theta, X }: \theta \in \Theta \subset \mathbb{R}\}} \text{ for every positive constant c}$$ For example Let $X$ ~ $LogNormal(\theta, 1)~, \theta \in (-\infty, \infty)$ then $cX$ ~ $LogNormal(\theta^*,1)$ where $\theta^* = \theta + ln(c) \in (-\infty, \infty)$ . With this definition $\theta$ is a scale parameter. For the second definition it is required that $\theta$ is positive: $$2) ~ \theta > 0 \text{ is a scale parameter } iff \rightarrow \text{ the distribution of } X/\theta \text{ is independent of } \theta$$ If $X$ ~ $LogNormal(\theta, 1)~, \theta \in (0, \infty)$ (We restrict the parameter space) then $X/\theta $ ~ $LogNormal(\theta + ln(1/\theta), 1)$ . With this definition $\theta$ is not a scale parameter. I was wondering which of these two is the correct definition of a scale parameter? Or it depends on the book and the author?","['statistics', 'probability', 'probability-distributions', 'parametric', 'parametrization']"

3966500,Restricting split short exact sequence of quasi-coherent sheaves to their coherent sub-sheaves.,"Let $X$ be a projective variety, $Z$ a hypersurface section and $U \overset{def}= X \setminus Z$ its complement, an open affine subscheme of $X$ . Let $i:U \hookrightarrow X$ be the corresponding open embedding. Given a coherent sheaf $M$ on $U$ we can consider the quasi-coherent sheaf $i_*M$ . This seems to have a filtration of coherent sheaves in the following manner: Let's assume we are working on an affine chart and $W=\text{Spec}(R)$ is an affine in this chart and the equation of $Z$ corresponds to the element $f$ in $R$ . The quasi-coherent sheaf $i_*M|_{W\cap U}$ on $W$ has this increasing filtration that $M_0=M|_W$ , $M_1=\frac 1fM|_W$ , $M_2=\frac 1{f^2}M|_W, \ldots$ . This filtration seems to glue and give a filtration by coherent sheaves $(i_*M)_0\subset (i_*M)_1 \subset \ldots$ of $i_*M$ . (Please correct me if I am wrong). Note that for each $j$ , $i^*(i_*M)_j\cong i^*i_*M\cong M$ . Now let's consider a short exact sequence of vector bundles on $X$ like $0\rightarrow E_1 \rightarrow E_2 \rightarrow E_3 \rightarrow 0$ . This leads to a short exact sequence of quasi-coherent sheaves $0\rightarrow i_*i^*E_1\rightarrow i_*i^*E_2\rightarrow i_*i^*E_3\rightarrow 0$ which restricts back to the original short exact sequence on $U$ . Note that this exact sequence of quasi-coherent sheaves is split. This is because short exact sequence of vector bundles split on $U$ . If the contents of the first paragraph is correct, my question is, does this split short exact sequence of quasi-coherent sheaves restrict to a split short exact sequence of coherent sheaves of the form $0\rightarrow (i_*i^*E_1)_j\rightarrow (i_*i^*E_2)_j\rightarrow (i_*i^*E_3)_j\rightarrow 0$ for each $j\geq 0$ ?

3966598,Reference Needed: $m$-faced dice with $n$ options,"I would like to investigate the following question and I am not sure if similar ideas have been investigated. I cannot really find a detail discussion about this matter on the Internet. It will be great if you can tell me what domain I should look into, or you may also give your view on the following questions. Suppose we have one fair dice. We would like to choose an option randomly from 6 possible options. We roll the dice once then we can decide which option we should choose. Suppose we now have 8 options. To choose an option randomly, different algorithms can be used.
For example, roll the dice once first. If the result is odd, we focus on option 1 to 4. Then roll the dice again, if we get 1 to 4, we know which option to use. If it is a 5 or 6, repeat the second step again. If the result is even, we focus on option 5 to 8. Then roll the dice again, if we get $n$ , which $1\leq n\leq 4$ , we choose option $n+4$ . If it is a 5 or 6, repeat the second step again. One can check the the probability of choosing each option is exactly $\frac{1}{8}$ . My question now is to investigate if it is possible that for whatever number of options we have, we can always use a dice to choose an option randomly. And is there a general algorithm to follow in order to choose an option? My second question is more advance. Suppose we have a fair $m$ -faced dice and we have $n$ total options. Can we choose an option randomly by using the dice for any $m$ and $n$ ? Once again, you don't have to answer the above two questions. I am looking for hints or domain that I should look into. Thank you.","['dice', 'probability', 'reference-request']"
3966662,Ring is Noetherian if it admits a faithful finitely generated module with ACC on submodules generated by ideals,"I have a (commutative unitary) ring $A$ and a faithful finitely generated module $M$ over $A$ which satisfies ACC on submodules of the form $IM$ , where $I\subset A$ is an ideal. I want to prove that $A$ is Noetherian. I have already proved that, because $M$ is finitely generated, if $M$ is a Noetherian $A$ -module, then $A/Ann(M)$ is a Noetherian ring. So, given my hypothesis, to prove that $A$ is Noetherian as a ring it suffices to prove that $M$ is Noetherian as $A$ -module. I've been given a sketch of proof, but I'm stuck with filling in the details. Here's the sketch: Proceed by contradiction and assume $M$ is not Noetherian. Consider the set $\{IM \mid I\subset A \text{ is an ideal and }M/IM \text{ is not Noetherian}\}$ and reduce to the case where $M$ is not Noetherian, but for every ideal $I\neq 0$ , $M/IM$ is Noetherian. Then consider the set $\Gamma = \{N\subset M \mid M/N \text{ is a faithful } A\text{-module}\}$ , find a maximal element in $\Gamma$ and conclude. Here's my attempt at using the hints I've been given: using ACC on submodules of the form $IM$ I found a maximal submodule $JM$ such that $M/JM$ is not Noetherian, so I thought substituting $M$ with $M/JM$ , but $M/JM$ is clearly not faithful so I don't think that's the right approach. Then I tried to assume the reduction to just $M$ not Noetherian had been made and tackled the set $\Gamma$ . I managed to find a maximal element (using Zorn's lemma), but I'm clueless on how to use that maximal element to conclude. I don't need the solution straight away, just some help to understand the hints better would be very much appreciated.

3966914,Proving or disproving basic facts about infinite series,"I am self-learning Real Analysis from Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abott. I'd like to ask, if my proof to the below question on convergence of infinite series is rigorous and sufficient, and checks out. $\newcommand{\absval}[1]{\left\lvert #1 \right\rvert}$ Give an example of each or explain why the request is impossible referencing the proper theorem(s). (a) Two series $\sum {x_n}$ and $\sum{y_n}$ that both diverge but where $\sum x_n y_n$ converges. (b) A convergent series $\sum x_n$ and a bounded sequence $(y_n)$ such that $\sum x_n y_n$ diverges. (c) Two sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ where $\sum x_n$ and $\sum (x_n + y_n)$ both converge but $\sum y_n$ diverges. (d) A sequence $(x_n)$ satisfying $0 \le x_n \le 1/n$ where $\sum (-1)^n x_n$ diverges. Proof. (a) The simplest examples I could come up with are: (i) $\sum x_n = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}$ and $\sum y_n = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}$ are both divergent sequences, but $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}$ is convergent. (ii) $\sum x_n = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}$ and $\sum y_n = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n+1}$ are both divergent sequences, but $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}$ is convergent. To see that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}$ is convergent, we simply note that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^p}$ is convergent for $p > 1$ , so $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}$ is convergent. And $\frac{1}{n(n+1)} < \frac{1}{n^2}$ , so by the Comparison test, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}$ is convergent. (b) I think that this request is impossible. The series $\sum x_n$ is convergent. By the Cauchy Criterion, given any $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists $N \in\mathbf{N}$ , such that \begin{align*}
	\absval{x_{m+1} + x_{m+2} + \ldots + x_{n}} < \frac{\epsilon}{M}
\end{align*} for $n > m \ge N$ . Also, the sequence $(y_n)$ is bounded, so $\absval{y_n} \le M$ for all $n\in\mathbf{N}$ . Consider the expression $\absval{x_{m+1}y_{m+1} + \ldots + x_{n}y_{n}}$ . We can write, \begin{align*}
	\absval{x_{m+1}y_{m+1} + \ldots + x_{n}y_{n}} &\le \absval{x_{m+1}\absval{y_{m+1}} + \ldots + x_{n}\absval{y_{n}}}\\
	&\le \absval{x_{m+1}M + \ldots + x_{n}M}\\
	&=M \absval{x_{m+1} + \ldots + x_{n}}\\
	&<M \cdot \frac{\epsilon}{M} = \epsilon
\end{align*} So, by the Cauchy criterion, $\sum x_n y_n$ is a convergent series. (c) This request is impossible. By the Algebraic Limit Theorem, if $\sum (x_n + y_n)$ converges and $\sum y_n$ converges, then $\sum (x_n + y_n) - \sum (y_n) = \sum x_n$ is also convergent. (d) I think that this request is impossible as well. We know that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n}$ converges. I have a hunch, that the the alternating series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n x_n$ is always bound by $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n /n$ . By the Algebraic Limit theorem, $\lim_{n \to \infty} 0 \le \lim_{n \to \infty} \le \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n}$ , so $\lim_{n \to \infty}x_n = 0$ . I would like to show that $(x_n)$ is a decreasing sequence.","['convergence-divergence', 'solution-verification', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

3967092,equivalent properties of cardinals,"Let $A\neq \emptyset$ be a set. Show that the following are equivalent: $|\mathbb{N}| = \aleph_0\leq |A|$ $|A| = n|A|$ for any $n\geq 2\in \mathbb{N}$ $|A| = \aleph_0 |A|$ I want to show $(1)\Rightarrow (2)\Rightarrow (3)\Rightarrow (1).$ $(1)\Rightarrow (2)$ . Suppose $(1)$ holds. Then there is an injection $f : \mathbb{N}\to A.$ It suffices to show that $|A| = |A| + |A| = |A\times 2| = |A\times \{0\}\cup A\times \{1\}|$ , where $2 = \{0,1\},$ since an inductive argument can be applied to give the required result. So we need to define a bijection $f : A \to A\times 2.$ Let $\mathcal{F} := \{(X,f) : X\subseteq A, f : X\to X\times 2\text{ is a bijection}\}.$ Observe that $\mathcal{F}$ is nonempty because $A$ contains a denumerable subset $X$ , and thus there exists a bijection $f : X\to X\times 2.$ Order the elements of $\mathcal{F}$ by extension. That is, let $(X_1, f_1) \leq (X_2, f_2)$ if $X_1\subseteq X_2$ and $f_2\vert_{X_1} = f_1$ . Let $C = \{(X_i, f_i)\}_{i\in I}$ be a chain in $\mathcal{F}.$ Let $X = \cup_{i\in I} X_i$ and $f : X\to X\times 2$ be defined so that $f(x) = f_i(x),$ where $i\in I$ is so that $x\in X_i.$ Then note that $(X,f)$ is an upper bound for $C,$ and is in $\mathcal{F}.$ So by Zorn's Lemma, $\mathcal{F}$ has a maximal element, say $(Y, g).$ Suppose $|Y| < |A|.$ Then $|A\backslash Y| = |A| - |Y| = |A|.$ So $A\backslash Y$ has a denumerable subset $Z.$ Since $Z$ is denumerable, there is a bijection $h : Z\to Z\times 2.$ Then let $i : Y\cup Z\to (Y\cup Z)\times 2, i(w) = \begin{cases}g(w),&\text{ if $w \in Y$}\\
h(w),&\text{ otherwise }\end{cases}$ Then $(Y,g) < (Y\cup Z, i),$ a contradiction. So $|Y| = |A|.$ Hence $|A| = |Y| = |Y\times 2| = |Y| + |Y| = |A| + |A|,$ as required. $(2)\Rightarrow (3).$ One can find a bijection between $\{1,\cdots, n\}\times A$ and $\{1,\cdots, n+1\}\times A$ for any $n\geq 1$ , since $n|A| = (n+1)|A|$ (indeed $n|A| = |A|$ so $(n+1)|A| = n|A| + |A| = |A| + |A| = |A|$ ). Hence, one can find a bijection between $\{1\}\times A$ and $\mathbb{N}\times A,$ which implies $|A| = |\{1\}\times A| = |\mathbb{N}\times A| = \aleph_0 |A|.$ $(3)\Rightarrow (1).$ If $|A| = \aleph_0 |A|,$ then there is a bijection $f : A \to \mathbb{N}\times A.$ Fix $a \in A$ and let $h : \mathbb{N}\to A, h(b) = f^{-1} (b,a).$ Observe that $h$ is injective because if $b\neq d,$ then since $f^{-1}$ is injective, $h(b) = f^{-1}(b,a) \neq f^{-1}(d, a) = h(d).$ Thus, $\aleph_0 \leq |A|.$ Is this incorrect?

I would like to understand if there are some sufficient conditions guaranteeing the possibility of doing this transition, I don't even need a constructive way to build this continuous version, ""just"" existence would already be a great thing to understand.

This question should be easier since there is not the constraint in the dimension. I know it is quite a broad question, but I need at least some terminology to look for.

Patrolling Google Scholar or Web of Science has not been enlightening in whetting my curiosity. I usually find references that leave me unsure if they're on topic or, if I can glean that they do seem to touch on this topic, they are beyond my current skill set to gather any understanding or sense of the field.

3967289,"Why does a convex polyhedron being vertex-, edge-, and face-transitive imply that it is a Platonic solid?","Suppose that we have a convex polyhedron $P$ , such that the symmetry group of $P$ acts transitively on its vertices, edges, and faces (that is, it is isogonal, isotoxal, and isohedral). It then follows that $P$ is one of the Platonic solids , which have a number of equivalent definitions but usually includes some stipulation that the faces are regular. (Once you have regular faces plus these symmetry conditions, most other properties follow easily.) This can be shown via a rather gross casework argument on the number of sides at each face. By face-transitivity, all faces are congruent (in fact, we only need that the polyhedron be monohedral for this). By edge-transitivity, said faces are equilateral polygons. Then we break into cases by the number of sides of the polygons: If the faces are triangles, being equilateral implies being regular. If the faces are non-regular equilateral quadrilaterals, they are rhombi. Then, at every vertex there must be an equal number of ""skinny"" and ""wide"" angles meeting, and there must be at least 3 faces meeting at a vertex. But then there are at least two skinny and two wide angles (since we assume the angles are different), so the angles at each vertex add up to at least 360 degrees, which is not possible in a convex polyhedron. If the faces are non-regular equilateral pentagons, then they have angles which are not all the same; however, each vertex must have the same angles around it, so each vertex has a proportional fraction of the angles of the pentagons. But for any distribution other than the uniform one, the only way to have a proportional amount of every angle is to have some $n$ copies of every angle with multiplicity, since $5$ is prime. (E.g. if there are $2$ angles of one size and $3$ of another, we can't get a $2:3$ ratio without having at least $5$ angles at every vertex.) But the angles of a pentagon add to more than $360^\circ$ , so we can't have them all at once. If the faces are hexagons or higher, they cannot form a topological sphere by Euler's formula. However, I don't like this proof very much; I walk away from it with no understanding of why this behavior occurs, and it certainly doesn't suggest any generalizations to other dimensions (where I believe the analogous statement - that transitivity on every degree of cell in a convex polytope implies regularity - is true, though I would appreciate a reference for this fact). Is there a natural or more elegant proof of this statement? One thing to note is that any proof must somehow use the fact that we are working on the sphere. In the case of planar tilings, the corresponding implication is false: being transitive on faces, vertices, and edges does not imply that one is looking at a tiling of regular polygons! As a counterexample, consider a rhombic tiling like this one: As another aside, relaxing any one of these conditions allows for polyhedra whose faces are not congruent regular polygons: the rhombic dodecahedron is face-transitive and edge-transitive, an isosceles tetrahedron is face-transitive and vertex-transitive, and the cuboctahedron is edge-transitive and vertex-transitive.","['polyhedra', 'geometry', 'alternative-proof', 'platonic-solids', 'symmetry']"

3967357,finite subsets proof,"If $A$ is an infinite set then $\mathcal{F}(A),$ the set of finite subsets of $A$ has the same cardinality as $A$ . Is the following proof of the above fact correct? Note that $|A_k|\leq |A^k|$ for any $k\geq 0,$ where $A_k$ is the set of subsets of $A$ of cardinality $k$ since the map $f : A_k\to A^k, f(\{a_1,\cdots, a_k\}) = (a_1,\cdots, a_k)$ is injective (indeed for two different subsets, at least one element differs, so that element will be mapped to a different tuple by $f$ ). Then $\mathcal{F}(A) = \cup_{k\geq 0} A_k$ , which is a disjoint union as $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for $i\neq j$ (the cardinality of a finite set is unique). So $|\mathcal{F}(A)| = \sum_{k\geq 0} |A_k| \leq \sum_{k\geq 0}|A^k| = \sum_{k\geq 1}|A^k| = \sum_{k\geq 1} |A| = \aleph_0 |A|$ . Also, $g : A\to A_1, g(a) = \{a\}$ is clearly a bijection, so $|A| = |A_1| \leq |\mathcal{F}(A)|$ as $A_1\subseteq \mathcal{F}(A)$ and if $B\subseteq A$ then there is clearly an injective (identity) function from $B$ to $A.$ So $|\mathcal{F}(A)| = |A|$ by transitivity (for infinite sets this also applies).","['elementary-set-theory', 'cardinals']"
3967362,Evaluate $\lim_{z\to\infty} \frac{(1 - z^4)^{1/4}}{z}$.,"I'm going through my (applied) complex analysis notes from almost a year ago and trying to make sense of something I wrote down. Of course, anybody's own solution is very much welcome. We used the ""+""-shaped branch cut, $\{z ~|~ z \in [-1,1] \subseteq \mathbb{R}\} \cup \{z ~|~ \text{Re}(z)=0,\, \text{Im}(z) \in [-1,1]\}$ , with the specified branch of $(1-z^4)^{1/4}$ corresponding to the first quadrant of the plane evaluating to the positive fourth root. Here is what I have written down: The possible values are $e^{i\pi/4}, -e^{i\pi/4}, ie^{i\pi/4}, -ie^{i\pi/4}$ . Again, relying on continuity of the branch, what is the best path to $\infty$ ? Choose $1 + \epsilon \to \infty$ along the positive real axis. Factoring the numerator, \begin{align*} 	(1 - z^4) &= (-1)(z - 1)(z + 1)(z - i)(z + i) \\ (1 - z^4)^{1/4} &= (-1)^{1/4}(z - 1)^{1/4}(z + 1)^{1/4}(z - i)^{1/4}(z + i)^{1/4}. \end{align*} Let $z = 1 + w$ with $w$ small, i.e. $w = \epsilon e^{i\theta}$ , then $$ f(1 + w) = (-1)^{1/4} (w^{1/4})(2 + w)^{1/4} (2 + 2w + w^2)^{1/4} $$ for $\theta \in (-\pi,\pi)$ . For $\theta = \pi$ , then $$f(z) \approx \sqrt{2} w^{1/4} e^{-i\pi/4} + (\text{smaller terms}).$$ The argument of $f(z)$ for $z = 1 + w$ for small $w$ is $-\pi i/4$ . The limit is therefore $e^{-i\pi/4} = -ie^{i\pi/4}$ . I very much remember not comprehending it at the time as well many other classmates, and also remember that the professor stated that they made an error near the end because he forgot the $\sqrt{2}$ , so I may have added that back in wrong. I apologize for any lack of clarity. My questions are If we're taking a path along the positive real axis as in $1 + \epsilon \to \infty$ , then why are we taking $\epsilon \to 0$ as in "" $w$ small"" in the computation? Why choose $\theta = \pi$ . My guess for the latter is so that the your values ""remain"" in the first quadrant because your dividing the argument of $e^{\pi i}$ by 4. And the major question is that I can't figure out why with $|w|$ small that $\arg f(z) = -\pi i/4$ . Why negative? I'm guessing it's due to how we evaluate $(-1)^{1/4} = (e^{-\pi i})^{1/4} = (e^{\pi i})^{1/4}$ but that confuses me if we're also taking $w = \epsilon e^{i\theta}$ and evaluating $\theta = \pi$ . (Edit:) Another question: Is the statement of the problem, well, problematic? Does this problem even make sense?

3967414,"If $A$ is a ring, then why is $\operatorname{Proj} A[t] \cong \operatorname{Spec} A$?","The following is an example I saw in a book on Algebraic Geometry. Example: Let $A$ be a ring and consider $A[t]$ , with the grading given by $\deg t = 1$ and $\deg a = 0$ for $a \in A$ . Then the structure map gives an isomorphism $\operatorname{Proj} A[t] \cong \operatorname{Spec} A$ By structure map, the authors mean a morphism of schemes $\varphi : \operatorname{Proj} A[t] \to \operatorname{Spec} A$ . I am not sure exactly what this morphism would be however, I assume that we start off with the standard embedding $A \hookrightarrow A[t]$ and then apply the functor $\operatorname{Spec}$ to get a map $\operatorname{Spec} A[t] \to \operatorname{Spec} A$ and then pre-compose that with the inclusion $i : \operatorname{Proj} A[t] \to \operatorname{Spec} A[t]$ to get the desired morphism $\varphi$ . Now firstly, the $\operatorname{Proj}$ construction only works for graded rings. So $A[t]$ should be of the form $A[t] = \bigoplus_{d \geq 0} A_d$ . The authors say above "" the grading given by $\deg t = 1$ and $\deg a = 0$ for $a \in A$ "" , and I assume that this means that $A_0$ is the image of the standard inclusion of $A$ in $A[t]$ , and that $A_1 = (t)$ , the ideal generated by $t$ so that ""essentially"" $A[t] = A_0 \oplus A_1 = A \oplus (t)$ . Is this the correct interpretation? Now onto the claim that the $\varphi$ yields an isomorphism. I don't even see why $\varphi$ is a bijection, let alone a homeomorphism. If I label the embedding $A \hookrightarrow A[t]$ as $j$ , then $\varphi$ is given by $\varphi(\mathfrak{p}) = j^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})$ for any $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Proj} A[t]$ and to say that $\varphi$ is bijective would mean that every prime ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ of $A$ is of the form $\mathfrak{q} = j^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})$ for some unique $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Proj} A[t]$ and for starters I do not see why this would be the case. Furthermore I would need to show that the morphism of sheaves $\varphi^\sharp : \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} A} \to \varphi_* \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj} A[t]}$ is also isomorphic and the way one usually does is by looking at basic open sets on $\operatorname{Spec} A$ . In more words -  if I wanted to see what $\varphi^\sharp$ would be in this case, then if I chose an $f \in A$ and considered the open subset $D(f) \subseteq \operatorname{Spec} A$ then $\Gamma(D(f), \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} A}) \cong A_f$ . But $$\Gamma(D(f), \varphi_*\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj} A[t]}) = \Gamma(\varphi^{-1}(D(f)), \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj} A[t]})$$ and this may not have such a nice form as far as I know, since $\varphi^{-1}(D(f))$ might not be a basic open subset of $\operatorname{Proj} A[t]$ . So I cannot express $\varphi^\sharp_{D(f)} : \Gamma(D(f), \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} A}) \to  \Gamma(\varphi^{-1}(D(f)), \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Proj} A[t]})$ in any nice way to allow me to check that $\varphi^\sharp$ would indeed be an isomorphism.",['algebraic-geometry']

EDIT: by calculating derivatives, it is straightforward to prove that the roots of $s_n(z)$ can be written as $z_i = - \frac{1}{\lambda_i}$ with $$ \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i^k = \frac{1}{2} \textrm{ for all } k =1,2,\cdots,n. $$ In other words, characterizing the roots is equivalent to solving $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \cdots + \lambda_n & = & \frac{1}{2} \\
\lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \cdots + \lambda_n^2 & = & \frac{1}{2} \\
& \vdots & \\
\lambda_1^n + \lambda_2^n + \cdots + \lambda_n^n & = & \frac{1}{2}.

3967597,"Is the use of the quadratic formula valid? (Flammable Math's ""How REAL Men Solve Equations"" video)","I was wondering whether the steps used in Flammable Math's YouTube video ""How REAL Men Solve Equations"" are valid or not. It's a joke video, but all of his work seems correct. Is this a valid use of the quadratic formula? $$8x=1\Rightarrow 4x+4x-1=0$$ $$\Rightarrow (x)2^2+(2x)2-1=0$$ $$
\Rightarrow 2_{12} = \frac{-2x\pm \sqrt{4x^2+4x}}{2x}
$$ $$
\require{cancel} = \frac{-\cancel{2x}\pm\cancel{2x} \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{x}}}{\cancel{2x}}

$$ $$
\Rightarrow 9 = 1+\frac{1}{x} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{8}=x
$$ I believe it is because if you let $2 = y$ , you get a quadratic equation in terms of $y$ , then you can set up the quadratic formula to solve for $y$ . Like this $(x)(y)^2+(2x)y-1 = 0$ . So, we get $ y = \frac{-2x\pm \sqrt{4x^2+4x}}{2x}$ . Now that renaming made the manipulation make much more sense.","['algebra-precalculus', 'solution-verification', 'quadratics']"

3967661,Understanding the notion of distance between two symmetric convex bodies,"I am new to the notion of distance between two symmetric convex bodies , and I am looking for some help in understanding the same. This is also meant to be an informative post for those who are not already familiar with the idea and want to scratch their brains a little on New Year's Eve. I hope you enjoy it! To begin with, I quote the definition with a supplementary figure below: The distance $d(K, L)$ between symmetric convex bodies $K$ and $L$ is the least positive $d$ for which there is a linear image $\tilde L$ of $L$ such that $\tilde L ⊂ K ⊂ d\tilde L$ . Note that this distance is multiplicative, not additive: in order to get a metric (on the set of linear equivalence classes of symmetric convex bodies), we would need to take $\log d$ instead of $d$ . In particular, if $K$ and $L$ are identical then $d(K, L) = 1$ . From the image it seems that the distance between $K$ and $L$ , is not dependent on the size of $L$ . I mean, we are looking at a linear image $\tilde L$ of $L$ , so looks like all information about the initial size of $L$ is already lost. Is it safe to conclude that $d(K,L)$ does not depend on the size of $L$ , and only on its shape ? Does it depend on the size of $K$ , or that is immaterial too? The author remarks that if $K$ and $L$ are identical , then $d(K,L) = 1$ . What does identical mean? Only the shape , or also the size ? $d(K,L) = 1$ just means $\tilde L ⊂ K ⊂ \tilde L$ so that $K = \tilde L$ . Again, this says nothing about the size of $L$ originally. To add to this, does the converse hold, i.e. if $d(K,L) = 1$ then are $K$ and $L$ identical? I think so. It is worth noting that $\tilde L$ is defined as the linear image of $L$ , i.e. $$\tilde L = \alpha L = \{\alpha z : z\in L\}$$ where $\alpha \in\mathbb{R}^{+}$ right? This means $\tilde L ⊂ K ⊂ \tilde L$ can be written equivalently as $\alpha L ⊂ K ⊂ d\alpha L$ which gives $$\frac{K}{d\alpha} ⊂ L ⊂ \frac{K}{\alpha} \implies \tilde K \subset L\subset d\tilde K$$ where $\tilde K = \frac{K}{d\alpha}$ . So can we conclude that $d(K,L)$ is symmetric , i.e. $d(K,L) = d(L,K)$ for all $K,L$ ? This is indeed a desirable property, I would not want the distance between two symmetric convex bodies to depend on the order in which they are chosen as arguments to $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ . If $d(K,L) = \beta$ , and $d(L,M) = \gamma$ , what can we say about $d(K,M)$ ? Here are my thoughts, please let me know if this makes sense: From the definition, we know that there exist linear images $\tilde L, \tilde M$ of $L,M$ respectively such that $$\tilde L\subset K\subset \beta\tilde L \text{ and }\tilde M \subset L\subset \gamma\tilde M$$ hold. Since $\tilde M$ is some linear image of $M$ , we might as well write $\tilde M \subset L\subset \gamma\tilde M$ as $\tilde M \subset \tilde L\subset \gamma\tilde M$ by scaling $\tilde M$ by an appropriate factor (the one with which you would relate $L$ and $\tilde L$ ). This brings us to: $$\tilde M \subset \tilde L \subset K \subset \beta \tilde L \subset \beta\gamma\tilde M \implies \tilde M \subset K\subset \beta\gamma\tilde M\implies d(K,M) = \beta\gamma$$ So $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ is multiplicative . Not to mention, this is a little weird and contrary to the notion of distance (between two points) that we are familiar with in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . On Pg.9 of the attached reference (below), it is written that the distance between the cube $K = [-1,1]^n$ and the Euclidean ball $B = B^n_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is at most $\sqrt{n}$ . $d(K,B) \le\sqrt{n}$ makes sense because the largest ball inside the cube has radius $1$ , while the ball that circumscribes the cube has radius $\sqrt{n}$ . Why does the author say ""at most"" in place of ""exactly""? Is it possible that $d(K,B) < n$ ? I think $d(K,B) = n$ . Are there any other interesting properties of $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ that you can think of? These are all the ones that came to my mind. A lot of times it's easier to understand new concepts with examples . It'd be extremely helpful if someone could provide some examples (in the usual $\mathbb{R}^2$ , $\mathbb{R}^3$ as well as in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\ge 4$ ) of bodies $K$ and $L$ , along with $d(K,L)$ and the thought that went into computing the same.

3968030,How many rectangles can be found in this shape?,"Question : How many rectangles can be found in the following shape? My first solution: Let $a_n$ be the number of rectangles in such a shape with side length $n$ . Then, the number of the newly added $1 \times k$ rectangles while expanding the shape with side length $n-1$ to the shape with side length $n$ is, $n^2$ . Similarly, the number of the newly added $2 \times k$ rectangles while expanding is, $(n-2)^2$ , the number of the $3 \times k$ ones is $(n-4)^2$ , and so on. So, we have, $$a_n = a_{n-1} + 1^2+3^2+\ldots +n^2$$ or, $$a_n = a_{n-1} + 2^2+4^2+\ldots +n^2$$ depending on the parity of $n$ . In either case, we have $$a_n=a_{n-2}+1^2+2^2+ \ldots n^2$$ So, $a_{n+1} = a_{n-1} + 1^2+2^2+ \ldots (n+1)^2$ . Subtracting both sides, we have, $a_{n+1}-a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} + (n+1)^2$ . Repeating the same method, we obtain $$a_{n+1}-4a_n+5a_{n-1} = 5a_{n-3} - 4a_{n-4}+a_{n-5}$$ This recurrence relation has characteristic equation $r^6-4r^5+5r^4-5r^2+4r-1=0 \iff (r-1)^5 \cdot (r+1) = 0$ . So, using the usual ways to solve recurrence relations, we can obtain $a_n=\frac{n^4}{24} + \frac{n^3}{4} + \frac{11n^2}{24} + \frac{n}{4} = \binom{n+3}{4}$ . However, since the answer is so simple, I tried to solve it with a method which can give the result in a more 'direct' way: Let us find these rectangles by choosing 2 rows and 2 columns and looking at their intersection. If we choose the right most column, we have $n$ choices for the other column and only $1$ choice for the rows. If we choose column which is the second from right, we have $n-1$ choices for the other column (in order not to over count), and, $\binom{2+2-1}{2}$ (number of ways to choose 2 rows out of 2 rows including repetitions) choices for the row. Using this argument, we can obtain, $$a_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (n-k) \cdot \binom{(k+1)+2-1}{2} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (n-k) \cdot \binom{k+2}{2}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-k) \cdot (k+2) \cdot (k+1)}{2}$$ After some computation, we can see from here that $a_n=\binom{n+3}{4}$ . However, I think this solution is also overcomplicated and I think that there is a really elegant and/or 'direct' solution for this problem. So, my question is, how can this problem be solved with a 'direct' method (for example, a combinatorial method which immediately gives the number as $\binom{n+3}{4}$ )?

3968128,Can the plane be covered by open disjoint one dimensional intervals?,"I remember I heard this question a while ago but have never figured it out. Let an open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ of the form $(a,b)$ . Now, imaging placing it in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , anywhere we want while keeping its length but perhaps rotating it if we want. Essentially this creates a line segment without its start/endpoints parametrized by $P(1-t)+Qt$ for $0<t<1$ where $P$ and $Q$ are its start and end points and with length $||P-Q||=b-a$ . As an example, if we take the unit interval $(0,1)$ , we can place it as it is in $\mathbb{R}^2$ as $(0,1)\times \{0\}$ or we can rotate it as $\{1\}\times (0,1)$ etc. I hope it is clear what I mean. My question is the following. Can we cover the entire $\mathbb{R}^2$ with disjoint such ""open intervals"" or if you prefer, line segments of finite length without their start/endpoints? I don't remember if the initial question I read was using only unit intervals, or of any length $(a,b)$ and I don't know if that plays a role in the answer but as a gut feeling, I doubt it does. My impression is that the answer is negative and we can't cover the plane in such a manner, or if it is possible it would use some weird abstract construction perhaps involving AC. Any help is appreciated! Edit: It seems that I could have phrased my wording a bit better although that was my last paragraph in the post above that I wasn't certain if it mattered whether we need to have fixed length intervals or not. Apparently it does, it is impossible with using only fixed length intervals but it is possible if we allow intervals of different lengths. Proof of impossibility in one case given in a paper given in the answers, and a construction in the other case is given by some answers and also found in that paper itself.

Note that $f(y|X=x) = \dfrac{f(x,y)}{f_X(x)} = \dfrac{2x}{\int_x^{x+1}2x \; dy} = 1$ . So, $E[Y^2|X=x] = \int_0^2y^2 \; dy = \dfrac{8}{3}$ .

Thus an element of $\mathbb Z_{64}\times \mathbb Z_{2}\times\mathbb Z_2$ has order 2 iff it's nonzero and its $\mathbb Z_{64}$ factor is $0$ or $32$ (the elements of order 2 in $\mathbb Z_{64}$ ).

Define $Z_j = f''(W(t_j))[(W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j))^2 - (t_{j+1} - t_{j})]$ where $W(t)$ is a Brownian motion , $t \geq 0.$ Show that $\mathbb{E}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}Z_j = 0.$ My attempt: \begin{align}
\mathbb{E}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}Z_j
&= \mathbb{E}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f''(W(t_j))[W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j)]^2 - \mathbb{E}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f''(W(t_j))(t_{j+1}-t_j)\\

The official solution goes as follows: $Z_j$ is $\mathcal{F}(t_{j+1})$ - measurable and $\mathbb{E}[Z_j|\mathcal{F}(t_j)] = 0.$ I'm okay with both these steps and have easily proved it. But then they do the following working which I'm not clear with: $\mathbb{E}\big[\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}Z_j\big] = \mathbb{E}\big[\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\mathbb{E}[Z_j|\mathcal{F}(t_j)]\big] = 0.$ My question regarding their solution is the following: $Z_j$ is $\mathcal{F}(t_{j+1})$ - measurable so $\mathbb{E}[Z_j|\mathcal{F}(t_{j+1})] = Z_j$ so how can they replace $Z_j$ with $\mathbb{E}[Z_j|\mathcal{F}(t_{j})]$ ? I know that $\mathbb{E}[Z_j|\mathcal{F}(t_{j})]$ is $\mathcal{F}(t_{j})$ - measurable but can't understand the logic used in their solution.

For any continuous action of a topological group $G$ on a topological
space $M$ ; the quotient map $\pi : M \to \dfrac{M}{G}$ is an open map. Recall: Suppose we are given an action of a group $G$ on a topological space $M$ ; which we
write either as $\theta: G \times G \to M$ or as $(g,p) \to g.p $ . (For definiteness, let us assume
that $G$ acts on the left; similar considerations apply to right actions.) Recall that the
orbit of a point $p \in M$ is the set of images of $p$ under all elements of the group: \begin{align}
G.p=\{g.p : g \in G\}
\end{align} Define a relation on $M$ by setting $p \sim q$ if there exists $g \in G$ such that $g.p=q$ .
This is an equivalence relation, whose equivalence classes are exactly the orbits of $G$ in $M$ . The set of orbits is denoted by $\dfrac{M}{G}$ ; with the quotient topology it is called
the orbit space of the action","['manifolds', 'topological-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

It follows immediately from the Invariance of Domain that: $(*) \quad$ The projections $M_{i}-h_{i}(0) \rightarrow M_{1} \# M_{2}, i=1,2,$ are open maps. This implies that $M_{1} \# M_{2}$ is second countable. We have to show that it is a Hausdorff space. (This is not immediate: The identification of $h_{1}(x, t)$ with $h_{2}(x, t)$ yields in general a non-Hausdorff manifold!) In view of $(*)$ this reduces to showing that if $x \in M_{1}-h_{1}(0)$ and $y \in M_{2}-h_{2}(0)$ have distinct images in $M_{1} \# M_{2},$ then they have neighborhoods with disjoint images. The verification is a routine case-by-case checking. Now, the fact that $g_{2} \alpha_{m} h_{1}^{-1}$ is a (orientation preserving) diffeomorphism together with $(*)$ implies that the smooth structures on $M_{1}-h_{1}(0)$ and $M_{2}-h_{2}(0)$ are compatible, hence yield a (oriented) smooth structure on $M_{1} \# M_{2}$ .

Question 3: https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/bmo2-2011.pdf To paraphrase the question, it asks for the number of positive integers $n < 2011$ such that $f(n) = f(2011) = 21$ , where $f$ is defined on the positive integers as: $f(1) = 1$ $f(4n) = f(2n)$ $f(4n+1) = 2f(2n) + 1$ $f(4n+2) = 2f(2n+1)$ $f(4n+3) = f(2n+1)$ My method was to note that the only ""path"" to $21$ is $1,2,5,10,21$ . The only positive ints that are mapped to $1$ are of the form $2^a - 1$ , and so the only ints mapped to $2$ are of the form $2^b(2^a-1)$ , and continuing in this fashion and expanding out, we have the only integers that map to $21$ are those of the form $2^{a+b+c+d+e}-2^{a+b+c+d}+2^{a+b+c}-2^{a+b}+2^e$ , where $a,b,c,d,e \geq 1$ . So the number of solutions is equal to the number of sequences $y_1 > y_2 > y_3 > y_4 > y_5 \geq 1$ such that $$ 2^{y_1} - 2^{y_2} + 2^{y_3} - 2^{y_4} + 2^{y_5} - 1 < 2011$$ . This in turn is equal to the number of sequences $x_1 > x_2 > x_3 > x_4 > x_5 \geq 0$ such that $$ 2^{x_1} - 2^{x_2} + 2^{x_3} - 2^{x_4} + 2^{x_5} \leq 1005 $$ . Then I defined the function $F_k(n)$ as equal to the number of solutions to the more general problem, where the sum of powers must be $\leq n$ and there are $k$ variables instead of $5$ , so the answer is $f_5(1005)$ . Because of the self similarity of the constraint, we have the following recurrence relation: $$ F_k(n) = \sum_{m\geq 0}{F_{k-1}\left\lfloor\frac{n + (-1)^k2^m}{2^{m+1}}\right\rfloor} $$ With base cases of: $$ F_1(n) = \lfloor \log_2{n} \rfloor $$ $$ F_k(n) = 0 \text{ when } n \leq 0$$ I implemented both the original problem and my solution in Python to check, and they both gave the same answer, $455$ , so my solution is correct. However the paper is intended to be done without a calculator or computer, and it computing the desired value of $F$ by hand seems to need far too many calculations (these questions rarely require drawn out calculations). So I assume that there is a more efficient method, either in calculating the values of $F$ or by looking at the problem from a completely different angle, both of which I would find extremely helpful.","['contest-math', 'functional-equations', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
