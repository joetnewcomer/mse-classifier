1704927,Nonlinear elliptic PDE - passing to the limit,"In the notes I am trying to follow one can find the following argument (part of a longer proof on existence of a weak solution to a certain type of nonlinear elliptic pde): Let $V = H^1_0(\Omega)$ and  consider $(u_m) \subset V$ such that $||u_m||_V \leq C$ for all m. It follows that (after some abuse in labelling) $u_{m_k} \to u$ weakly in V, $u_{m_k} \to u$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ and $u_{m_k} \to u$ a.e. in $\Omega$. Furthermore, let $v \in V$ with $v_m \to v$ in $V$. Finally, $a(x,u)$ is a Caratheodory function (so in particular continuous w.r.t to the second variable) with uniform bounds $A_1 \leq a \leq A_2$. Then, apparently, we use Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT) to conclude that 
$$
a(\cdot,u_{m_k})\nabla v_{m_k} \to a(\cdot,u)\nabla v \text{ in } L^2(\Omega),
$$
which also apparently allows us to conclude that
$$
\int_{\Omega} a(x,u_{m_k})\nabla u_{m_k} \cdot \nabla v_{m_k} \to \int_{\Omega} a(x,u)\nabla u \cdot \nabla v.
$$
First of all, I reckon that in the first line there is a typo and we have $u_{m_k}$ instead of $v_{m_k}$, as the way it is I suppose we do not need DCT to show $L^2$ convergence (adding zero cleverly seems to be enough). If there indeed is a typo there, then how can we apply DCT? In its form stated in the notes, we would need a.e. convergence of LHS to RHS but for that we would need a.e. convergence of $\nabla u_{m_k}$ - does it follow from a.e. convergence of $u_{m_k}$? If there is no typo, then how can we go from first line to the second?

1704993,Haar Measure of a Topological Ring,"A topological ring is a (not necessarily unital) ring $(R,+,\cdot)$ equipped with a topology $\mathcal{T}$ such that, with respect to $\mathcal{T}$ , both $(R,+)$ is a topological group and $\cdot:R\times R\to R$ is a continuous map.  A left Haar measure on $R$ is a (nonnegative) measure $\lambda$ on $R$ with respect to the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra of $R$ such that there is a multiplicative map $l:R\to[0,\infty]$ called a left multiplier for which $l(x\cdot y)=l(x)\,l(y)$ for all $x,y\in R$ , $\lambda(x\cdot S)=l(x)\,\lambda(S)$ for all $x\in R$ and for any Borel measurable subset $S\subseteq R$ (with respect to $\mathcal{T}$ ), and $\lambda$ is a Haar measure for the topological group $(R,+)$ . (We interpret $0\cdot \infty$ and $\infty\cdot 0$ as $0$ .) An example is the ring $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ of $n$ -by- $n$ matrices over $\mathbb{R}$ under the topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\cong\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ (here, $\cong$ means ""is homeomorphic to"").  If $\textbf{A}=\left[a_{i,j}\right]_{i,j=1,2,\ldots,n}$ , then we take $\text{d}\lambda(\textbf{A})$ to be $\prod_{i=1}^n\,\prod_{j=1}^n\,\text{d}a_{i,j}$ (i.e., $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure of $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\cong \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ ).  Then, $\lambda$ is a left Haar measure of $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ with respect to the left multiplier $l(\textbf{X}):=\big|\det(\textbf{X})\big|^n$ for all $\textbf{X}\in\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ . Another example is $(\mathbb{C},+,\cdot)$ .  We take $\lambda$ to be such that $\text{d}\lambda(z):=\text{d}x\,\text{d}y$ for $z=x+\text{i}y$ .  Then, a left multiplier is $l(w):=|w|^2$ for each $w\in\mathbb{C}$ .  Similarly to the case of the ring of real $n$ -by- $n$ matrices, $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})$ has a left Haar measure $\lambda$ with respect to $l(\textbf{X}):=\big|\det(\textbf{X})\big|^{2n}$ for all $\textbf{X}\in\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})$ , i.e., $\text{d}\lambda(\textbf{A}):=\prod_{i=1}^n\,\prod_{j=1}^n\,\left(\text{d}x_{i,j}\,\text{d}y_{i,j}\right)$ for $\textbf{A}=\left[x_{i,j}+\text{i}y_{i,j}\right]_{i,j=1,2,\ldots,n}$ . The third example here is $\mathbb{R}[T]/\left(T^n\,\mathbb{R}[T]\right)$ equipped with the topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}^n$ .  For $f(T)=\left(a_0+a_1T+\ldots+a_{n-1}T^{n-1}\right)+\left(T^n\,\mathbb{R}[T]\right)$ , we take $\text{d}\lambda(f):=\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\,\text{d}a_i$ .  Then, a left multiplier is $l(g):=\left|b_0\right|^n$ , for $g(T)=\left(b_0+b_1T+\ldots+b_{n-1}T^{n-1}\right)+\left(T^n\,\mathbb{R}[T]\right)$ . Note that we can also similarly define the notion of right Haar measures for rings and their corresponding right multipliers (which are usually denoted by $r$ in this thread). If a ring has both left and right Haar measures, then (due to commutativity of addition) the two Haar measures coincide (up to scalar multiple) and we can omit the adjectives left and right , and simply call them Haar measures (or two-sided Haar measures to be precise). The adjectives ""left"" and ""right"" only indicate which kind of multipliers the ring has.  A ring with a Haar measure is unimodular if the left multiplier coincides with the right multiplier; otherwise, we call the ring non-unimodular . Then, $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ , $\mathbb{C}$ (as well as $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})$ ), $\mathbb{R}[T]/\left(T^n\,\mathbb{R}[T]\right)$ (as well as $\mathbb{C}[T]/\left(T^n\,\mathbb{C}[T]\right)$ ), the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ of $p$ -adic integers (see Crostul's comment below), and the ring of formal power series $\mathbb{F}_p[\![ T]\!]$ (see Jyrki Lahtonen's comment below) are examples of unimodular rings.  Of course, many of these rings are commutative rings, and commutative rings with Haar measures are necessarily unimodular. An example of non-unimodular rings is as follows.  Consider $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ (some people may denote it by the semidirect sum $\mathbb{R}\,{\supset\!\!\!\!\!\!+}\,\mathbb{R}$ ) with the usual entry-wise addition, but with the twisted multiplication $(u,v)\cdot(x,y):=(ux,uy+v)$ .  Then, with the Haar measure $\text{d}\lambda(a,b):=\text{d}a\,\text{d}b$ , we notice that a left multiplier of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is $l(u,v):=|u|^2$ for every $u,v\in\mathbb{R}$ , whereas a right multiplier is $r(u,v):=|u|$ for every $u,v\in\mathbb{R}$ .  The ring $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\times\mathbb{R}^n$ (also denoted by $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\,{\supset\!\!\!\!\!\!+}\,\mathbb{R}^n$ ) and the ring $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})\times\mathbb{C}^n$ (also denoted by $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})\,{\supset\!\!\!\!\!\!+}\,\mathbb{C}^n$ ), with the usual entry-wise addition and with the twisted multiplication $(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{u})\cdot(\mathbf{B},\mathbf{v}):=(\mathbf{AB},\mathbf{Av}+\mathbf{u})$ , are also non-unimodular for the same reason. Has there been any study on this sort of concepts?  I'm sure that I am not the first who thought about the notion of Haar measures for rings.  Are there any criteria for a ring to be unimodular?  Are there rings with Haar measures of a given characteristic $k>0$ which are non-unimodular, or simple, or at least non-commutative?  Are there rings with left Haar measures, but without right Haar measures?  (Unlike groups, I expect to find rings with only one kind of Haar measures.)  The cardinality of each example of rings with Haar measures I have so far is that of the continuum $\mathfrak{c}=2^{\aleph_0}$ .  Do there exist rings with Haar measures of higher cardinalities?  Please let me know if you have or know of any references. On the other hand, there may be some pathology with this concept of Haar measures for rings, and because of that, nobody introduces this concept.  If that is the case, would you please let me know why? EDIT I: I removed a wrong example from the question.  It turns out that, with respect to the discrete topology, $(\mathbb{Z},+,\cdot)$ does not have a Haar measure. EDIT II: I think I may need another compatibility condition, as stated in menag's reply below.  That is, I may need to enforce the following condition (which I shall name it left compatibility ): for any Borel measurable subset $S\subseteq R$ and for every $x\in R$ , $x\cdot S$ is also Borel measurable.  For right Haar measures, we may similarly define right compatibility .  Alternatively, I may need to modify Condition 2 to $\lambda(x\cdot S)=l(x)\,\lambda(S)$ for each Borel measurable subset $S\subseteq R$ and for any $x\in R$ such that $x\cdot S$ is Borel measurable (and likewise for right Haar measures).  I am in favor of the former modification (i.e., the left or right compatibility condition) and shall assume it in all instances. EDIT III: I may be wrong about this claim: ""An abelian group has at most one Haar measure (up to scalar multiple).""  (See the boldfaced portion of my question.)  Without the locally compact Hausdorff assumption, there may be an abelian group with two essentially different Haar measures.  If the underlying additive group of a ring is isomorphic to such an abelian group, then the ring may have a left Haar measure and a right Haar measure which are not proportional.  Maybe somebody who knows better about topological groups can give me some insight.","['reference-request', 'topological-groups', 'representation-theory', 'measure-theory', 'topological-rings']"
1705016,"If $g \circ f$ is surjective, show that $f$ does not have to be surjective?","Suppose $f: A \to B$ and $g: C \to D$ are functions, and that $B ⊆ C$. I need to come up with an example where $g \circ f$ is surjective but $f$ is not. I'm confused on how exactly to do that, but I understand that to show something is surjective you have to have the range of the function equal to the codomain of the function. Here's my attempt: So if $g(x) = x^2$ with a codomain of $ℝ$, and $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ with a codomain of $ℝ$, then $g(f(x)) = (\sqrt{x})^2 = x$. Since the range of this function and codomain are the same, this is surjective. But, since $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, its range is only $[0, ∞)$, which is smaller than its codomain of $ℝ$, meaning $f$ is not surjective.","['elementary-set-theory', 'examples-counterexamples', 'function-and-relation-composition', 'functions']"

1705258,Domain and Range Confusion,"Find the domain of the inverse of the following function:$$f(x) = kx^\frac{1}{2}$$ The inverse, using some basic algebraic rearranging, can be said to be: $$f^{-1}(x) = \frac{k^2}{x^2}$$ As evident, the domain of this function seems to be all real numbers. However, a property of functions states that, The domain of $f(x)$ is equal to the range of $f^{-1}(x)$, and the domain of $f^{-1}(x)$ is equal to the range of $f(x)$ We know that the range of $f(x)$ is $x>0$; The presumed domain of $f^{-1}(x)$ doesn't equal the range of $f(x)$.

1705380,"Rusty at complex integrals, finding error in steps","I am looking for some help spotting where I messed up some computations, it's been awhile... I'll show my work to my answer and then say what the correct answer is...
Integrate:
$$\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\cos(3\theta)}{5-4\cos(\theta)}\mathrm{d}\theta$$ Let $z=e^{i\theta}$ for $0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi$. Then $|z|=1$ and 
$$\cos(3\theta)=\frac{z^3+z^{-3}}{2}=\frac{z^6+1}{2z^3}$$ and 
$$\cos(\theta)=\frac{z+z^{-1}}{2}$$ implies 
$$\frac{\cos(3\theta)}{5-4\cos(\theta)}=\frac{z^6+1}{2z^3}\cdot \frac{z}{(-2z^2+5z-2)}$$
$$=\frac{z^6+1}{2z^2(-2z^2+5z-2)}=-\frac{z^6+1}{4z^2(z^2-\frac{5}{2}z+1)}=-\frac{z^6+1}{4z^2(z-1/2)(z-2)}.$$
Thus by the change of variable,
$$\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\cos(3\theta)}{5-4\cos(\theta)}\mathrm{d}\theta=\oint_{|z|=1} -\frac{z^6+1}{4z^2(z-1/2)(z-2)} \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{iz}$$
$$=-\frac{1}{4i}\oint_{|z|=1} \frac{z^6+1}{z^3(z-1/2)(z-2)} \mathrm{d}z.$$
Now obviously the poles of $f(z)=\frac{z^6+1}{z^3(z-1/2)(z-2)}$ are $z_0=0$, of order 3, and the simple poles $z_1=1/2$ and $z_2=2$. Only $z_0,z_1\in int \,\gamma$ where $\gamma=\{z\in \mathbb{C} : |z|=1\}$ (and $int \cdot$ is the interior of a set) thus by the Cauchy-residue theorem, we have
$$\oint_{|z|=1} \frac{z^6+1}{z^3(z-1/2)(z-2)} \mathrm{d}z=2\pi i (Res(f,0)+Res(f,1/2)).$$ Now
$$Res(f,0)=\frac{1}{2!} \lim_{z\to 0}\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}z^2}z^3f(z)=\frac{1}{2}\lim_{z\to 0}\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}z^2}  \frac{z^6+1}{(z-1/2)(z-2)}=\frac{21}{2}$$
by an elementary yet tedious calculus computation. I used wolfram alpha to be honest. Next,
$$Res(f,1/2)=\lim_{z\to 1/2} (z-1/2)f(z)=\lim_{z\to 1/2}  \frac{z^6+1}{z^3(z-2)}=\frac{(1/2)^6+1}{(1/8)(-3/2)}=-\frac{65}{12}$$
Thus
$$\oint_{|z|=1} \frac{z^6+1}{z^3(z-1/2)(z-2)} \mathrm{d}z=2\pi i\frac{61}{12}.$$
But,
$$\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\cos(3\theta)}{5-4\cos(\theta)}\mathrm{d}\theta=-\frac{1}{4i}\oint_{|z|=1} \frac{z^6+1}{z^3(z-1/2)(z-2)} \mathrm{d}z$$
$$=-\frac{1}{4i}2\pi i\frac{61}{12}=-\frac{61}{24}\pi.$$
However wolfram says the integral (in its original form) is equal to $\pi/12$. Where did I mess up?","['complex-analysis', 'integration']"

1705424,How to statistically beat this dice game?,"There is a dice game on this site where you can bet a video game's currency in games. I was wondering if any of the more statistically minded could come up with a way of beating the system?
The game's rules are as follows: The player may bet a certain amount of chips on rolling above or below a    certain number on a 10,000 sided die, whereby the odds are the same, eg 45% chance of winning, above 55.00 or below 45.00. The player must make a MINIMUM bet of 2500. The player can set their own multiplier and odds. The relation is such that at a 2x multiplier of the bet, the chances of winning are 45% and at 5x it is 18% The maximum bet is such that the multipier*bet is equal to 1 billion. The player is every half hour given 100,000 chips to bet. Here is my strategy that I have been using:
Roll the 100,000 chips to 1 million.
Using a 5x multiplier, roll until lose 12 rolls on the lowest bet possible, then bet .2% of the cash stack, doing so two times if the first lost, then doubling the previous bet and so on until profit is made. The reason I bet double every two is that, because the odds of getting 13 losses is 0.82^13, eventually a win should turn out and the risk of loss only lowers. I have made it up to 3 billion chips, then lost them all when I got up to 200 million chip bets, which was max and kept on losing them.

So the probability is 
$$\frac{\mathsf C(4,4)\times \mathsf C(48,1)}{\mathsf C(52,5)}$$ Method 2: We have $4$ aces in total. so probability of selecting an ace from $52$ cards is 
$4/524$ , then we are left with $51$ cards and selecting again another ace gives probability $3/51$. Similarly for next two aces probability will be $2/50$ and $1/49$. Now we are left with total $48$ cards and we can obviously choose any of these $48$ card which gives probability of $48/48$.

1705742,"If $\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to\infty}f^{\prime}(x)$ both exist, then $\lim_{x\to\infty}f^{\prime}(x) = 0$","Suppose $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is everywhere differentiable, and suppose that $\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to\infty}f^{\prime}(x)$ both exist. I am trying to prove that the latter limit is necessarily $0$. I have the following argument, but I'm not sure if it's completely sound. Since $f$ is differentiable everywhere, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem to $f$ on $[x,x+1]$ for all relevant $x$. This guarantees an $\alpha_{x}\in(x,x+1)$ such that $$f^{\prime}(\alpha_{x}) = \frac{f(x+1)-f(x)}{x+1-x} = f(x+1)-f(x).$$ Now, the limit as $x\to\infty$ of the right-hand side of this expression must be $0$, since $\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)$ exists by assumption (and must equal $\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x+1)$). On the left hand side, we notice that $\alpha_{x}\to\infty$ as $x\to\infty$, since $\alpha_{x}>x$ always, so that:
\begin{eqnarray*}
0 & = & \lim_{x\to\infty}[f(x+1)-f(x)]\\
& = & \lim_{x\to\infty}f^{\prime}(\alpha_{x})\\
& = & \lim_{y\to\infty}f^{\prime}(y),
\end{eqnarray*}
proving the result. I took inspiration for this argument from other sources which use the same trick of ""use the Mean Value Theorem to introduce a quantity $\alpha_{x}$ which we have some bounds on, then take limits"". However, this style of argument seems dodgy to me: we haven't actually defined a function $\alpha$ to take the limit of as $x\to\infty$, and it's not clear to me that defining such a function is always possible. For example, we can't just say ""take the least such value and call it $\alpha_{x}$"", because we haven't shown that there will always be a least such value. Here are my questions: In the above, where have we used the fact that $\lim_{x\to\infty}f^{\prime}(x)$ exists? This is an important assumption: consider for example the function $x\mapsto\sin{(x^{2})}/x$. My guess is that it's used in the last line, where we must assume this fact to use the chain rule, but I'd like confirmation of this. Does the ""$\alpha_{x}$ trick"" require something like the Axiom of Choice in general? In particular, the thing which makes me slightly anxious about just saying ""choose an $\alpha_{x}$ for every $x$"" is that we have to make (uncountably) infinitely many ""choices"", and we have no prescribed method of doing this. EDIT : It turns out this has been answered in other questions on this site, see link in the comments below. EDIT : Note that the first question is different to others on related topics because here I am asking very specifically about this argument and why it works.","['real-analysis', 'calculus', 'limits']"

Furthermore, an abstract argument shows that there exists a Hilbert space norm $\lVert\:\cdot\:\rVert_2$ on $B(H)$, but it does not provide us with a very concrete description of such a norm. In the finite-dimensional case one might take the Hilbert–Schmidt norm : this turns $B(H)$ into a Hilbert space and it is known to be submultiplicative. However, in the infinite-dimensional case this does not work, for now the space of Hilbert–Schmidt operators is a proper subspace of $B(H)$. This leads me to the following question: Question. Is there a submultiplicative Hilbert space norm on $B(H)$ if $H$ is infinite-dimensional, either by abstract reasoning or by concrete example?

Consider: $$\|\cdot\|_1:=\sum_n 2^{-n} |\cdot|_{e_n} \tag{1}$$ This defines a norm and the topology of this norm is Weaker than the uniform topology: You have $\|A\|≥|A|_{e_n}$ and then $\|A\|=\sum_n 2^{-n} \|A\|≥\sum_n 2^{-n} |A|_{e_n}$. Strictly weaker than uniform topology in the case of $X$ a Hilbert space and $e_n$ ONB: Denote $\pi_n$ the orthogonal projection onto span of $e_n$, then $\sum_{n=N}^\infty \pi_n$ converges to zero in this topology but not in uniform norm. Stronger than the strong operator topology. Becomes equal to the strong operator topology upon restriction to bounded subsets. For 3 and 4 see here . I don't know the relation to the $\sigma$-strong topology (generated by seminorms $\sqrt{\sum_n |\cdot|^2_{x_n}}$ whenever $\sum_n |x_n|^2$ converges), but it looks like this is weaker than the $\sigma$-strong topology.

The problem originally described (see below) has been reduced to the correctness of a simple extension of an argument from Rudin's PMA.  Feel free to skip to the proposed solution, below. As part of a much needed calculus review, I've been working through Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis.  Besides the following, I've found the prospective on the material therein to be rather illuminating -- which leads me to believe I've missed something, in this case. The proof of a lemma (10.38) to be used in the proof of Poincare's Lemma (10.39) cites the following fact: (to paraphrase) $V=\{(x,y)|x\in\Bbb{R^{p-1}, y\in\Bbb{R}}\}; p>1$; V convex open.  $U=\{x|(x,y)\in V \text{ for some y}\}$.  It follows that there is a continuously differentiable function on U, let's call it $\alpha$, such that $(x,\alpha(x))\in V.$ This is one of very few proof details in Rudin explicitly left as an exercise.  The hint is that $\alpha$ may be taken to be a constant if V is a ball; it should also be noted that the same $\alpha$ notation is conspicuously used in the proof of the existence of partitions of unity on compact sets. Now, ignoring the hints and using inf, sup, and handling the special case of extended values, I think I can find a continuous $\alpha$ easily enough, but the resulting function is not necessarily smooth. I've seen a totally different solution involving countable open coverings, compact exhaustions, and smooth partitions of unity on open sets, but, although this solution makes use of the hints, I'm apprehensive about this scheme because it relies on so much machinery not mentioned in the text or exercises elsewhere in the book.  It would be very uncharacteristic of the author if this were the intended solution (I say this having worked hundreds of other exercises from his books). With that in mind, can someone propose a solution scheme that does not rely on so much beyond-the-text machinery? EDIT!!  In particular, after examining Rudin's proof of the existence of partitions of unity on compact sets, I believe I have found an extension of his argument that works in this case.

If $\{U_n\}_1^\infty$ is a sequence of open dense subsets of $X$, then $\bigcap_1^\infty U_n$ is dense in $X$. b.) $X$ is not a countable union of nowhere dense sets. The name for this theorem comes from Baire's terminology for sets: If $X$ is a topological space, a set $E\subset X$ if of the first category, or meager, according to Baire, if $E$ is a countable union of nowhere dense sets; otherwise $E$ is of the second category. Let $\mathscr{Y} = L^1(\mu)$ where $\mu$ is counting measure on $\mathbb{N}$, and let $\mathscr{X} = \{f\in \mathscr{Y}:\sum_{1}^{\infty}n|f(n)| < \infty \}$ equipped with the $L^1$ norm. a.) $X$ is a proper dense subset of $\mathscr{Y}$; hence $X$ is not complete. b.) Define $T:\mathscr{X}\rightarrow \mathscr{Y}$ by $Tf(n) = nf(n)$. Then $T$ is closed but not bounded. c.) Let $S = T^{-1}$. Then $S: \mathscr{Y}\rightarrow \mathscr{X}$ is bounded and surjective but not open. Proof of a.) Clearly $0\in \mathscr{X}$. If $f,g\in \mathscr{X}$ and $a\in K$ then $$\sum_{1}^{\infty}n|(f+ag)(n)| = \sum_{1}^{\infty}n|f(n) + ag(n)| \leq \sum_{1}^{\infty}n|f(n)| + \sum_{1}^{\infty}n|ag(n)| = \sum_{1}^{\infty}n|f(n)| + |a|\sum_{1}^{\infty}n|g(n)| < \infty$$ So $\mathscr{X}$ is a subspace of $\mathscr{Y}$. Since $\sum_{1}^{\infty}n^{-2}$ converges but $\sum_{1}^{\infty}n^{-1}$ does not, the map $n\rightarrow n^{-2}$ is in $\mathscr{Y}\setminus \mathscr{X}$. Let $f\in mathscr{Y}$ and $\epsilon\in (0,\infty)$. There exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\sum_{n=N}^{\infty}|f(n)| < \epsilon$. It follows that $$\sum_{n=N}^{\infty}|f(n) - n^{-1}f(n)| = \sum_{n=N}^{\infty}(1 - n^{-1})|f(n)|\leq \sum_{n=N}^{\infty}|f(n)| < \epsilon$$ which implies that $\lVert f - g\rVert < \epsilon$, where $g\in \mathscr{X}$ is defined by $$g(n) := \begin{cases}
f(n) & \text{if } n < N\\
n^{-1}f(n) & \text{if } n\geq N

This shows that $\mathscr{X}$ is a proper dense subset of $\mathscr{Y}$, so $\overline{\mathscr{X}} = \mathscr{Y}\neq \mathscr{X}$ and hence $\mathscr{X}$ is not complete. proof of b.) no idea proof of c.) Clearly $Sf(n) = n^{-1}f(n)$ for all $f\in \mathscr{Y}$ and $n\in \mathbb{N}$. It follows that $$\lVert S f\rVert = \sum_{1}^{\infty}|Sf(n)| = \sum_{1}^{\infty}|n^{-1}f(n)| = \sum_{1}^{\infty}n^{-1}|f(n)| \leq \sum_{1}^{\infty}|f(n)| = \lVert f\rVert$$ for all $f\in\mathscr{Y}$, so $S$ is bounded. Since $S = T^{-1}$, it is obvious that $S$ is surjective. If $S$ were open then $T$ would be continuous, which contradict b.).

A^{27}-I &= (A-I)(A+A^2+A^3+\dots+A^{26})=0\\

1706074,Existence of the set of all subsets of a set [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : (exercise from Tao's analysis book) Proof of a lemma relating to power set of X (2 answers) Closed 8 years ago . I'm reading a book on basic analysis and came across the result that given a set $X$, there exists a set $\{Y : Y$ is a subset of $X\}$. The proof is left as an exercise and the hint states that one can start with the set $\{0, 1\}^X$ and apply the replacement axiom, replacing each function $f$ with $f^{-1}(\{1\})$. While the above route isn't difficult to understand, why can't we just define the required set as:
$\{f(X) \mid f\colon X \to X\}$? I suppose this also requires the axiom of replacement (the objects in question being $X$ and $f$) and looks fine to me, but there could be a problem with this reasoning, otherwise the author would've used this definition. If so, what's the problem? Apologies if this is a really basic question, but I'm working on improving my mathematical logic skills.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

1706162,Intuition behind definition of Stable Bundles?,"To my understanding, given a rank $r$ and degree $d$, we can fix a $C^{\infty}$ vector bundle $\mathcal{V}$ over some curve $\Sigma$ of genus $g$.  We then want to study the moduli space $M_{g}(r,d)$ of holomorphic structures on this fixed bundle $\mathcal{V}$.  Let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the space of holomorphic structures on $\mathcal{V}$.  Naively, we would simply use $\mathcal{C} / \rm{Aut}(\mathcal{V})$ as the moduli space, but apparently this space has terrible properties, i.e. isn't even Hausdorff, etc.  So I've heard Mumford's Geometric Invariant Theory is one way around this problem.  And this is where you see the familiar definition of stable vector bundles: $E$ is stable if $\mu(F) < \mu(E)$ for all proper, holomorphic sub-bundles $F \subset E$, where $\mu$ is of course the slope of the bundle. Personally, I don't have any intuition as to why this strange definition of stability leads to well-defined moduli spaces of bundles.  Is there any intuition anyone can help me with, or perhaps is it just the sort of thing where you say, with hindsight, it's simply the correct thing to do to force the Geometric Invariant Theory to work? EDIT: So restricting to simple bundles (where $\rm{Aut}\mathcal{V} = \mathbb{C}^{*}$) makes sense to me.  It seems to be analogous to asking that a group action not have fixed points; thus, avoiding singularities.  Maybe it would be helpful for me to consider how semi-stable bundles relate to simple bundles?

In how many ways can Bob choose his lunch for the next 30 days if he just returned from a vacation (and so hasn’t been at the cafeteria for the past few days)?

However, on each day after that he can only choose from $1444$ of those. So the total number of combinations of possible lunches over a $30$ day period is $1445 \cdot 1444^{29}$. The reasoning seems fine to me, but the number is making me doubt myself...","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Here, $k > 0$ . I am having difficulty understanding one of the maps involved in the proof. The proof is by induction on $k$ .  Assume we are in the inductive step, and we wish to prove the result for $\mathbf{S}^k$ , $k > 1$ .  We use a Mayer-Vietoris type of argument.  Decompose $\mathbf{S}^k$ as $U_1 \cup U_2$ , where $U_1$ is the sphere minus the south pole $S$ and $U_2$ is the sphere minus the north pole $N$ .  I am in the middle of showing the following result: Proposition:  For $p > 1$ , $H^{p-1}(U_1 \cap U_2) \cong H^p(U_1 \cup U_2)$ . The proof goes by constructing explicit maps, each of which is the other's inverse.  I am having trouble understanding why the specific map $H^{p-1}(U_1 \cap U_2) \to H^p(U_1 \cup U_2)$ is induced. Specifically:  Let $Z^p(M)$ denote the closed $p$ -forms on a manifold $M$ , $B^p(M)$ the exact $p$ -forms on the manifold, and $H^p(M) = Z^p(M)/B^p(M)$ the $p^{th}$ cohomology on the manifold. Define a map $G \colon Z^{p-1}(U_1 \cap U_2) \to H^p(U_1 \cup U_2)$ as follows.  Let $\nu$ be a closed $(p-1)$ -form on $U_1 \cap U_2$ .  Note that $\nu$ may blow up at either $N$ or $S$ .  Choose functions $\rho_1, \rho_2 \colon U_1 \cup U_2 \to \mathbf{R}$ such that $\rho_1$ vanishes on a neighborhood of $N$ , $\rho_2$ vanishes on a neighborhood of $S$ , and $\rho_1 + \rho_2 = 1$ .  Define a $(p-1)$ -form $\nu_1$ on $U_1$ by $\nu_1 = \rho_1 \nu$ and define a $(p-1)$ -form $\nu_2$ on $U_2$ by $\nu_2 = -\rho_2 \nu$ .  Define the $p$ -form $\omega$ on $U_1 \cup U_2$ by setting $\omega = d \nu_1$ on $U_1$ and $\omega = d \nu_2$ on $U_2$ .  Then $\omega$ is well-defined since on $U_1 \cap U_2$ , $d \nu_1 - d \nu_2 = d \nu = 0$ .  Clearly, $\omega$ is closed.  Lastly, set $G(\nu)$ to be the class of $\omega$ in $H^p(U_1 \cup U_2)$ .  I was able to prove that $G(\nu)$ is well-defined in the sense that it is independent of the chosen partition of unity. Question:  Why is it the case that $G$ induces a map $H^{p-1}(U_1 \cap U_2) \to H^p(U_1 \cup U_2)$ .  That is, why is it true that if $\nu$ is closed and exact, then $\omega$ is also exact? I realized after working on this for a bit that my method couldn't (shouldn't?) work because it would prove that $\omega$ is exact for any closed $\nu$ .  Specifically, I was only going off the fact that $d \nu = 0$ .  My natural instinct now is to show $\nu_1$ extends to $S$ (or $\nu_2$ extends to $N$ ), but why would $\nu$ being exact mean such an extension exists?  That doesn't seem right to me...  (Just to reiterate, $\omega$ is very close to being exact already; $\omega = d \nu_1$ (or $= d \nu_2$ ) except at just one point at which $\nu_1$ is not, a priori , defined.) Hope someone can help clear this up for me, understanding these maps has been very frustrating! Note: It might be helpful that $U_1$ and $U_2$ are contractible (hence have vanishing cohomology), $U_1 \cap U_2 \cong \mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{S}^{k-1}$ , $H^p(\mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{S}^{k-1}) \cong H^p(\mathbf{S}^{k-1})$ , we are in the induction step, etc... ???","['homology-cohomology', 'differential-topology', 'differential-forms', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

Now use $\cos^2x=\frac{1+\cos2x}{2}$ to rewrite the equation as $\cos\frac{2\pi}{l}+1=\cos\frac{2\pi}{m}+\cos\frac{2\pi}{n}$. Let $\omega_x=e^{i\frac{2\pi}{x}}$ for $x\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. Then $\frac{\omega_l+\overline{\omega_l}}{2}=\frac{\omega_m+\overline{\omega_m}}{2}+\frac{\omega_n+\overline{\omega_n}}{2}-1$. I do not know how to proceed from here. Any ideas? A solution with cyclotomic polynomials would be nice!","['number-theory', 'contest-math', 'cyclotomic-polynomials']"
1706620,The role of the Zariski topology in algebraic geometry,"I am having trouble understading the relevance of the Zariski topology being a topology. Every time I see the proof that sets of the form $V(I)=\{p\in\mathbb{A}^n\mid f(p)=0 \ \forall f\in I\}$ consitute a topology on the affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$, it looks to me like the topology axioms just happened by accident. When you begin to prove results about this topology, you find it to be nothing like the geometrically intuitive kind of spaces one encounters in analysis, geometric topology or differential geometry (open sets always intersect!). On the other hand, it feels right to talk about the Zariski topology because, for instance, algebraic morphisms between affine varieties happen to be continuous. But I just can't feel any intuition of continuity in this context. Why is it important that the Zariski topology be actually a topology?","['intuition', 'zariski-topology', 'soft-question', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1706634,Show that the set of all even permutations in $G$ forms a subgroup of $G$.,"Show that if $G$ is any group of permutations, then the set of all even permutations in $G$ forms a subgroup of $G$ . I know that I need to show the closure, identity, and inverses properties hold. So I need to prove: 1) If $p$ and $q$ are even permutations, then so is $pq$ . 2) Identity permutation is an even permutation 3) If $p$ is an even permutation, then so is $p^{-1}$ I am just unsure how to go about setting up each proof. Thanks in advance for the help.","['permutations', 'group-theory', 'symmetric-groups']"
1706636,Graph of Composite Sine and Cosine Function,I was playing around with a graphing calculator and I noticed that if you repeatedly apply sines and cosines in this manner: $$\sin(\cos(...{\sin (\cos{(\sin(x)}))))}$$ its graph flattens out. Why is this so?,"['trigonometry', 'calculus', 'graphing-functions']"
