What is the max of $n$?,"Suppose that we have $n\ (\ge 3)$ points in the three dimensional space and that every three of the $n$ points is the vertices of an isosceles triangle. Here, suppose that the vertices of an isosceles triangle do not exist on the same line. Question : What is the max of $n$? I have the following conjecture. Conjecture : The max of $n$ is $7$. We can see that $n=7$ is possible. (Example 1)

1040985,Poincare' s inequality for vectorfields on the sphere,"Let $\mathbb{S}^2$ be the standard 2-sphere, and let $V$ be $\mathcal{C}^1$ vectorfield on it.
I'd like to understand if it is true that there exists $C > 0$ such that, for all such $V$, we have
$$
\int_{\mathbb{S}^2}|\nabla V|^2 \mbox{d}\sigma_{\mathbb{S}^2}\geq C \int_{\mathbb{S}^2}|V|^2 \mbox{d}\sigma_{\mathbb{S}^2},
$$
where $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection associated to the standard metric, and $\sigma_{\mathbb{S}^2}$ is the standard volume form. My heuristic reasoning was the following: usually, for a Poincare' estimate on functions, you need either some condition on the support or on the integral mean of the function. Here, by the Hairy Ball Theorem, $V$ is ""pinned"" to be zero at one point, hence I wonder if this is sufficient to say something. In case it worked, I would also be interested in understanding if such an inequality holds for some subset of $H^1$-vectorfields on the sphere.","['inequality', 'differential-geometry']"

We know that $K_P=\mathcal{O}_P(-4,-2)$, where $\mathcal{O}_P(a,b):=\operatorname{pr}_1^*\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(a)\otimes \operatorname{pr}_2^*\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(b)$, and $K_X \cong \varepsilon^*K_P + E$, where $E\cong \mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ is the exceptional divisor. My question: Is $-K_X$ ample ? By Kleiman's ampleness criterion we must show that $K_X\cdot C < 0$ for every irreducible curve in $X$. If $C$ is not contained the exceptional divisor $E$ then it follows from the fact that $-K_P$ is ample. If $C$ is contained in $E$ then it is numerically equivalent to $a\ell_1+b\ell_2$, $a,b\geq 0$, where $\mathbb{P}^1\cong \ell_1 = \{\text{point}\}\times \mathbb{P}^1$ and $\mathbb{P}^1\cong \ell_2 \subseteq \mathbb{P}^2 \times  \{\text{point}\}$ are the generators of $\operatorname{NE}(E)$.

1041074,Generalized Binomial Model independent in the limit,"Start with a generalized binomial model $$P(X_{n+1}=1\mid \mathcal{F}_n)=\theta_n+ n^{-1} d_n \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$
$$P(X_{n+1}=1)=p_{n+1}=\theta_n + n^{-1}d_n \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$$ With $0\leq \theta_n+ d_n <1$. Then if we impose $p_n=p_m=p$ for any $n,m$, the distribution is identical and exchangeable (given no information). Correct? This requires $$p=\theta_n + d_np \iff p = \theta_n /(1-d_n),$$ but not necessarily that $d_n$ or $\theta_n$ converge as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Yet, for an exchangeable sequence, it will be an independent sequence in the limit. This leads me to believe $d_n \rightarrow 0$. But I don't know if this is justified or how to prove it if it is. Any ideas on how to interpret this kind of probability model if we require that each $X_n\in\{0,1\}$ is identically distributed? Terminology question too: If $p_m=p_n$, would you call $X$ an exchangeable sequence with respect to $\mathcal{F}_0=\{\emptyset, \Omega\}$ ? It seems like it should be exchangeable only in some kind of ex ante sense.","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

Let $K/k$ be an abelian extension of number fields with Galois group $G$, $I_k$ the ideles of $k$, and $P$ a prime of $k$ (with $v$ a place corresponding to $P$) which is unramified in $K$.  If $\mathfrak P$ is a prime of $K$ which lies over $P$, then $\mathcal O_K/ \mathfrak P$ is an extension of $\mathcal O_k/P$ having degree $f = f(\mathfrak P/P)$.  The Galois group of any finite extension of finite fields is cyclic. Shouldn't the decomposition group $G_P = \{ \sigma \in G : \sigma \mathfrak P = \mathfrak P\}$ also be cyclic then?  I thought $G_P$ modulo the inertia group (which is trivial, since $P$ is unramified) is isomorphic to the Galois group of residue fields.

1041559,What is the function $f(x)=x^x$ called? How do you integrate it?,"For real numbers $x > 0$, the function $f(x)=x^x$ seems pretty cool. Is there a name for this function? It's obviously been studied before. It grows faster than exponential functions and factorials but slower than double exponentials . We can find its derivative by writing it as $$f(x) = x^x = e^{\ln x^x} = e^{x \ln x}$$ This lets us use the chain rule to get $$f'(x) = e^{x \ln x} (\ln x + \frac{1}{x} \cdot x) =  x^x (1+ \ln x)$$ Since $x^x$ is never equal to zero, if we set $f'(x) =0$ we get $$1+ \ln x = 0$$ which gives $$ x= e^{-1} = \frac{1}{e}$$ This (perhaps unsurprising?) appearance of $e$ might be enough to make this function interesting. At any rate, I tried to find its indefinite integral and failed miserably. I guess my question is partially a reference request ... where can I read more about $x^x$?","['reference-request', 'exponentiation', 'exponential-function', 'integration']"

On the other hand, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem: $$(\mathbb Z_m)^\times \cong (\mathbb Z_{p_1^{\alpha_1}})^\times \times (\mathbb Z_{p_2^{\alpha_2}})^\times \times\dots \times (\mathbb Z_{p_k^{\alpha_k}})^ \times $$ 
$$(\mathbb Z_n)^\times \cong (\mathbb Z_{p_1^{\beta_1}})^\times \times (\mathbb Z_{p_2^{\beta_2}})^\times \times \dots \times(\mathbb Z_{p_k^{\beta_k}})^\times$$ Now, if we define:
$$\pi: \mathbb Z_m \longrightarrow \mathbb Z_n,\,\,\, a+(m) \mapsto a+(n)$$ then: $$\pi: \mathbb Z_{p_1^{\alpha_1}} \times \mathbb Z_{p_2^{\alpha_2}} \times \dots \times\mathbb Z_{p_k^{\alpha_k}} \longrightarrow \mathbb Z_{p_1^{\beta_1}} \times \mathbb Z_{p_2^{\beta_2}} \times \dots \times\mathbb Z_{p_k^{\beta_k}}$$

Now, the projection: $$\pi: \mathbb Z/p^{\alpha}\mathbb Z \longrightarrow \mathbb Z/p^{\beta}\mathbb Z$$ maps $(\mathbb Z/p^{\alpha}\mathbb Z)^ \times$ to $(\mathbb Z/p^{\beta}\mathbb Z)^\times$, but $a+(p^{\alpha}) \in (\mathbb Z/p^{\alpha}\mathbb Z)^ \times$ iff $(a,p^{\alpha})=1 \Rightarrow (a, p^{\beta}) =1 $, that is $a+(p^{\beta}) \in (\mathbb Z/p^{\beta}\mathbb Z)^ \times$. Now it is onto since if $\pi(a+(p^{\alpha})) = a+(p^{\beta}) \in (\mathbb Z/p^{\beta}\mathbb Z)^ \times$, then $(a, p^{\beta}) =1$ and this implies that $(a,p^{\alpha})=1$, so $a+(p^{\alpha}) \in (\mathbb Z/p^{\alpha}\mathbb Z)^ \times$ Then the natural surjective ring projection is also surjective on the units.","['ring-theory', 'chinese-remainder-theorem', 'proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra']"

Here's my thought process so far, using the definitions discussed previously in Rudin. $p$ is a limit point of E, so for every $N_r(p)$, $\exists q \in N_r(p)$ such that $q \ne p$ and $q \in E$. $q \in N_r(p) \Rightarrow |p - q| < r \Rightarrow |p-q| = r-h$, where $ 0 < h < r$ by definition of nbhd. $q \in E \Rightarrow |q| \leq 1$.

|p-q| &= r - h \\
&\leq |p| + |q| \\

I'm pretty sure countable choice is enough for that. From that it follows, for example, that in a Hilbert space with a given orthonormal basis, every vector can be expressed as a countable linear combination of basis vectors. But what happens if we drop choice? Can there be an essentially uncountable but summable series? Or does the wellorderability of the index set force the same fact to hold in ZF?

One point of confusion I had is that I thought it should be (${n{2n \choose n}}$). But then I related this to the idea that when you use the multiplication rule to find the number of ice cream possibilities, the cone choices (president choices) are separate from the flavor choices (group member choices)! So, the president should not be counted in the group member choices. (let me know if this is the correct way to think about it).

It is known (see the WP page ) that $g_n\lt (p_n)^\theta$ for every large enough $n$, for every $\theta\gt\frac34$, hence $S_\alpha$ converges for every $\alpha\gt4$. Various unproven results, such as Cramér's conjecture that $g_n=O\left((\log p_n)^2\right)$, would imply that $S_\alpha$ is finite if and only if $\alpha\gt1$. An answer for $\alpha=2$ would solve (and in fact would be equivalent to a solution of) this other question .

1042657,Gaussian processes versus Bayes rule misinterpretation,"I would like to use Gaussian processes (GP) for Bayesian classification of medical data. I think I already understand the basic stuff but I have some uncertainties that are perhaps partly related to the notation. It is known that in GP regression (assuming Gaussian likelihood function) the prediction on unknown data using GP can be obtained by using closed form formulas that are based on marginalizing jointly Gaussian multivariate distribution. However, to get more insight into the connection of GP with the Bayesian framework, I would like to see the derivation (or at least understand the idea behind this) using Bayes rule. I am interested in that since it can help me to understand what is happening in the case that likelihood is non-Gaussian and hence an elegant solution is no longer possible. I tried to find the solution to my questions on the Internet but to no avail. The notation I show further was taken from the online lecture on GP: http://videolectures.net/mlss2012_cunningham_gaussian_processes/?q=gaussian%20processed It is assumed that observed data values y are defined in terms of noisy-free function f with added Gaussian noise $\varepsilon $. $$
y=f+\varepsilon 
$$ I would solve the problem first by calculating the posterior distribution (1). [1] Data posterior:
$$
p\left ( f \right| y)=\frac{p\left (y|f\right)p\left (f\right )}{p\left (y  \right )}
$$ However, in order to get posterior (1), one needs to calculate the marginal likelihood, which is generally difficult. [2] Marginal likelihood: $$
p\left ( y \right )=\int p\left ( y|f \right )p\left (f  \right )df
$$ Finally, when one obtains the posterior distribution, it is possible to get the predictions by calculating other nasty integrals (3, 4). [3] Predictive posterior:
$$
p\left ( f^{*} \right| y)=\int {p\left (f^{*}|f\right)p\left (f|y\right )}df
$$ [4] Predictive distribution:
$$
p\left ( y^{*} \right| y)=\int{p\left (y^{*}|f^{*}\right)p\left (f{^{*}}|y\right )}df^{*}
$$ When I tried to do these calculations, I run into the problems that generated many questions: First, I don't know how to make integrations over the space of functions (equations 2-4). Specifically, marginalization (upon computing marginal likelihood [2]) with respect to the latent function f specified by Gaussian process prior p(f) makes a little sense for me. Second, It is known that for Gaussian likelihood (which is the case), the conjugated prior for the Gaussian process prior is again Gaussian process. It means that posterior probability distribution is Gaussian process and should integrate to 1 if it is valid probability distribution. I don't know what it means that Gaussian process integrate to 1 since Gaussian process is a distribution on function defined via mean function and covariance function (kernel). It is hard to see any relation of GP to some probability density function (pdf) over functions. Third, if we want to do classification, we need change Gaussian likelihood to some function that maps any input given by prior to <0,1> interval. Posterior is not Gaussian process in this case but one should expect that posterior should remain some infinite dimensional distribution since it is a result of the product of likelihood and GP prior (which is itself infinite dimensional). In case it is true, does not have such a distribution positive semidefinite kernel (otherwise it can be GP) ??? Fourth, What is the predictive posterior good for [3] ??. I consider useful only the predictive distribution [4], which give us the predictions on new values of y* [4]. It is however sometimes denoted also as the predictive posterior or posterior predictive, which is a bit confusing. Last, The posterior must be given by the product of prior and likelihood function. However, I  do read often that in the case of GP classification, GP prior is squeezed between <0,1> (using eg. logistic or probit function) rather than being multiplied by sigmoid likelihood function. I am so confused. Any help will be appreciated.

However, in the case of $X$ being uncountable, I cannot come up with any familiar space that $X^*$ is homeomorphic to. Can anyone help me out?","['general-topology', 'compactification', 'compactness']"
1042767,Simultaneously diagonalizable without distinct eigenvalues,"It is a well known result that if $u$ and $v$ are two diagonalizable endomorphisms of a $\mathbb{C}$ finite-dimensional linear space $E$, if $u$ (or $v$) has distinct eigenvalues and if $u$ and $v$ commute, then $u$ and $v$ are simultaneously diagonalizable. I am wondering what happens when we drop the hypothesis that $u$ or $v$ has distinct eigenvalues ? The usual proof consists in saying that if $(\lambda_{1},\ldots,\lambda_{n})$ are the distinct eigenvalues of $u$ and $E_{i} = \mathrm{ker}(u- \lambda_{i} \mathrm{Id})$ then $g_{\vert E_{i}}$ (the endomorphism induced by $g$ on $E_{i}$) is diagonalizable. Then if $B_{i}$ is a basis of $E_{i}$ composed of eigenvectors for $g$, $(B_{1},\ldots,B_{n})$ is a basis of $E$ which diagonalize both $u$ and $v$. What changes if the engenvalues are not distinct ?","['linear-algebra', 'diagonalization']"
