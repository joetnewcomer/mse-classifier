3984119,Enumerating separating subcollections of a set,"Let $S$ be a (finite) set, and let $C \subseteq 2^S$ be a collection of subsets of $S$ .  We say that a subcollection $C' \subseteq C$ is separating if for any two elements of $S$ there exists a subset in $C'$ that contains exactly one of the two elements. For example, any collection of cardinality less than $\log_2 \left\lvert S \right\rvert$ cannot be separating, while any collection of cardinality greater than $2^{\left\lvert S \right\rvert - 1}$ is separating. Is there an efficient algorithm to construct all separating subcollections given $S$ and $C$ ? I am particularly interested in finding separating subcollections of small cardinality.  Perhaps this question is equivalent to some other more well-known problem?","['combinatorial-designs', 'boolean-algebra', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms']"
3984147,Ito's Lemma: from $df$ to $df^2$ to get $\operatorname{Var}[df]$,"Consider the stochastic process \begin{align*}
dX_t&=\mu_t dt+\sqrt{Y_t}X_t dB_t \\
dY_t&=m_t dt+s\sqrt{Y_t} dW_t
\end{align*} where $dB_tdW_t=\rho dt$ , $s$ is a constant and $\mu_t$ and $m_t$ are well-behaved drifts. According to Ito's formula: \begin{align*}
df(X_t,Y_t) &= \left(\frac{1}{2}Y_tX_t^2f_{xx}(X_t,Y_t)+\rho s Y_tX_t f_{xy}(X_t,Y_t)+\frac{1}{2}s^2Y_tf_{yy}(X_t,Y_t)+\mu_t f_x(X_t,Y_t)+m_t f_y(X_t,Y_t)\right)dt \\
&\;\;\;\;\; +\sqrt{Y_t} X_t f_{x}(X_t,Y_t)dB_t+s\sqrt{Y_t} f_{y}(X_t,Y_t)dW_t.
\end{align*} My question: Is the following assertion correct? \begin{align*}
df(X_t,Y_t)^2 &= \bigg( Y_t X_t^2f_{x}(X_t,Y_t)^2+2\rho s X_tY_t f_{x} (X_t,Y_t)f_y(X_t,Y_t)+s^2 Y_t f_y(X_t,Y_t)^2\bigg)\text{d}t
\end{align*} This expression then gives $\operatorname{Var}[df]=E[df^2]-E[df]^2=E[df^2]=df^2$ , because $E[df]$ is of order $dt$ and squaring it makes it negligible whereas $df^2$ is non-random.","['variance', 'stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-differential-equations', 'probability-theory', 'stochastic-calculus']"

The method I employed against this problem was integration by parts, as shown below: $$\int_0^1\ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)~dx=2\int_0^1\text{artanh} x ~dx=2\left[x~\text{artanh}~x+\frac{1}{2}\ln\lvert 1-x^2\rvert\right]_0^1$$ However, I am unsure how to find the value that this converges to. I then tried to find a series representation of the value of the integral using the Maclaurin expansion of $\text{artanh}~x$ , which was successful; I found that the value of the integral is $$2\sum_{r=0}^\infty\frac{(2r)!}{(2r+2)!}=2\sum_{r=0}^\infty\left(\frac{1}{2r+1}-\frac{1}{2r+2}\right)=2\sum_{r=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^r}{r+1}$$ which I know is $2\ln2$ , which is the answer.
However, I would like to know how to use a regular method of integration such as my first method and still calculate the limit it converges to. Thank you for your help.","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'limits']"
3984368,Trying to understand the total derivative/differential.,"I'm asking this question because I'm having problems understanting the definition of differential/total derivative in multivariable calculus, and in order to improve my understanding of it, I want to make sure I have the right intuition behind the definition. Let $F:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ be a function and $a\in\mathbb{R}^n$ . We say that $F$ is differentiable at $a$ iff there exists a linear transformation $L:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ such that $$\lim_{x\to a}\frac{\|F(x)-(L(x-a)+F(a))\|_m}{\|x-a\|_n}=0.$$ In this case $L$ will be called the differential of $F$ at $a$ (as it is later proven that this linear transformation is unique) and will be denoted $DF_a$ . As my proffesor explained, the differential is the best linear aproximation there is to $F$ close to $a$ . Now, I understand that $G:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ defined as $G(x)=DF_a(x-a)+F(a)$ is moving the graph of the function $DF_a$ ( $Gr(DF_a):=\{(x_1,...,x_n,DF_a^1(x_1,...,x_n),...,DF_a^m(x_1,...,x_n))|x_i\in\mathbb{R},i=1,...,n\}$ , where each $DF_a^i:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ is the $i$ -th component function of $DF_a$ ), to the point $(a_1,...,a_n,F_1(a_1,...,a_n),...,F_m(a_1,...,a_n))$ , and in this sense $G(x)$ approaches $F(x)$ as $x$ goes to $a$ . This is where the confusion starts (please correct me in anything if I'm wrong). How is it justified that $G$ approaches $F$ as $x$ goes to $a$ ? Is it true that $\lim_{x\to a}\|F(x)-G(x)\|_m=0$ ? If so, why is that not the definition? How does dividing over something that goes to zero while preserving the existence and value of the limit guarantee that $G$ is the best linear approximation? As I've heard before, it is to be understood that $\|F(x)-G(x)\|_m$ goes to zero faster than $\|x-a\|_n$ does, as $x$ approaches $a$ , but once again, how is this justified? I'm sorry if this is too much or if it seems as if I have not worked as much in trying to learn this, but I really have been trying a lot lately and I'm having a hard time in doing so. Any help is greatly thanked for. Greetings.","['limits', 'multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives', 'intuition']"

3984396,"Why is $\operatorname{Hom}_\Bbb{Z}(A,A)$ a ring?","I am trying to prove and understand why the homomorphisms from an abelian group A to itself $\operatorname{Hom}_\Bbb{Z}(A,A)$ is a ring. Is my reasoning correct in the following proof? Show the homomorphisms from an abelian group A to itself $\text{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(A,A)$ form a ring. For two homomorphisms $\delta_1\ \colon V\to V$ and $\delta_2\ \colon V\to V$ $\in \text{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(A,A)$ define their additive and multiplicative binary operataions as $[\delta_1+\delta_2](x)=\delta_1(x)+\delta_2(x)$ and $\delta_1 * \delta_2=\delta_1 \circ \delta_2$ respectively. Additive Identity This would be the zero map so fix $\delta_1\in \text{Hom}_\mathbb{Z}(A,A)$ then $[\delta_1 + 0]=\delta_1$ $[0+\delta_1]=\delta_1$ Additive Associativity Addition of functions is associative. Inverse Suppose we have a homomorphism $\delta$ in $\text{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(A,A)$ . Define another homomorphism from A to itself as $\delta^{-1}(v):=(\delta(v))^{-1}$ which exists because the image of A under $\delta$ is a subgroup of A (well known theorem of Homomorphisms). Now we must show that the composition of these functions yields the zero function which is the identity of the Abelian group. Let $v$ be an arbitrary element in $A$ . Then $\delta(v)+\delta^{-1}(v)=\delta(v)+\delta(v^{-1})=\delta(v+v^{-1})=\delta(0)=0$ with the last equlaity following from the fact that $\delta$ is a group homomorphism. Multiplicative Associativity Composition of functions is associative. Multiplicative Identity This would be the identity homomorphism so fix $\delta_1 \in \text{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(A,A)$ then $(\delta_1 + 1)=(\delta_1 \circ 1)=\delta_1$ . Similarly, $(1 + \delta_1)=(1 \circ \delta_1)=\delta_1$ Multiplicative Distributive Laws Fix three homomorphisms $\delta_1, \delta_2, \delta_3$ . $\delta_1 * (\delta_2 + \delta_3) (x)= \delta_1 \circ (\delta_2 + \delta_3) (x) =\delta_1((\delta_2 + \delta_3)(x))=\delta_1(\delta_2(x) + \delta_3(x))=
\delta_1(\delta_2(x)) + \delta_1(\delta_3(x))=(\delta_1*\delta_2 + \delta_1*\delta_3)$ Using the fact that $\delta_1$ is a homomorphism.","['category-theory', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'group-theory']"
3984403,How can we derive the dot product from the covariance of two random vectors?,"I'm trying to understand a geometric interpretation of covariance as explained in this lecture pdf , which states: If X, Y are two random variables of zero mean, then the covariance Cov[XY ] = E[X Â· Y ] is the dot product of X and Y. The standard deviation of X is the length of X. The correlation is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. I can understand how, given a zero mean, the standard deviation of X is the length of X. What I don't understand is how the the covariance of X and Y is equal to it's dot product. Specifically, the covariance is defined as: $Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - \mu_X) (Y - \mu_Y)]$ Which with we can write as: $Cov(X,Y) = \sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j} p_{ij} (x- \mu_X) (y-\mu_Y)$ And since for two centered random variables the means are zero, and the probability is uniform, we can rewrite the formula as: $Cov(X,Y) = \dfrac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j} x y$ (Eqn 1) The dot product, in contrast consists of a single summation: $dot(X,Y) = \sum\limits_{i} x_i y_i$ (Eqn 2) Note that the $\frac{1}{N}$ factors out of Eqn 1 when I divide by the standard deviations of X and Y. So I almost can derive the dot product from the covariance, but the covariance still contains a double summation and the dot product has a single element-wise summation. What am I missing? UPDATE I don't have the answer, but I realize that this formula: $Cov(X,Y) = \sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j} p_{ij} (x- \mu_X) (y-\mu_Y)$ ... where N is the dimension of the vectors, is not equal to Eqn 1: $Cov(X,Y) = \dfrac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j} x y$ (Eqn 1) Since if $p_{ij}$ equals $\dfrac{1}{N}$ , it would sum to be greater then one in the double summation. $p_{ij}$ only equals $\dfrac{1}{N}$ when it's a single summation, which maps easily to the dot product. I've posted a new question here to try and address this confusion in isolation, which I hope in turn will clarify this derivation problem.","['inner-products', 'proof-explanation', 'covariance', 'probability']"
3984408,Find all functions $f(x^2-y^2)=f(xy)(f(x)+f(y))$,"Find all functions $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that, for all $x,y\in\mathbb R$ , we have $$f(x^2-y^2)=f(xy)(f(x)+f(y)).$$ Both $f(x)=0$ and $f(x)=1/2$ are solutions. Swapping $x,y$ in the equation implies that $f$ is even. Plugging in $x=y=0$ implies that $f(0)=0$ or $f(0)=1/2$ . If $f(0)=0$ , then plugging in $y=0$ implies that $f(x^2)=0$ .

3984526,How to get the coefficients of Taylor series in several variables when sums are grouped by order of partial derivatives,"Assume $f$ is real analytic in several variables. The Taylor series of $f$ can be represented in two forms (cf. e.g., wikipedia ). The first form is power series form: $$T(x_1,\dots,x_d)=\sum\limits_{(n_1,\dots,n_d)\in\Bbb N^d}\frac{1}{n_1!\cdots n_d!}\frac{\partial^{n_1+\cdots+n_d}f(a_1,\dots,a_d)}{\partial x_1^{n_1}\cdots\partial x_d^{n_d}}(x_1-a_1)^{n_1}\cdots(x_d-a_d)^{n_d}.\tag{1}$$ The second form is grouping summands by the order (number of variables) of partial derivatives: $$T(x_1,\dots,x_d)=f(a_1,\dots,a_d)+\sum\limits_{j=1}^d\frac{\partial f(a_1,\dots,a_d)}{\partial x_j}(x_j-a_j)\\+\frac{1}{2!}\sum\limits_{j=1}^d\sum\limits_{k=1}^d\frac{\partial^2f(a_1,\dots,a_d)}{\partial x_j\partial x_k}(x_j-a_j)(x_k-a_k)+\cdots\\+\frac{1}{n!}\sum\limits_{i_1=1}^d\cdots\sum\limits_{i_n=1}^d\frac{\partial^n f(a_1,\dots,a_d)}{\partial x_{i_1}\cdots\partial x_{i_n}}(x_{i_1}-a_{i_1})\cdots(x_{i_n}-a_{i_n})+\cdots.\tag{2}$$ I can derive the coefficients in power series form $(1)$ by differentiating term-by-term. But I encountered difficulty in deriving coefficients in the second form. Following is my attempt. The general $n$ -th term in the second form is like this (please correct me if I am wrong): $$\sum\limits_{i_1=1}^d\cdots\sum\limits_{i_n=1}^d c_{(i_1,\cdots,i_n)}(x_{i_1}-a_{i_1})\cdots(x_{i_n}-a_{i_n}).\tag{3}$$ $i_1,\dots,i_n$ can take duplicated values in $1..d$ . Assuming in $n$ indices $i_1,\dots,i_n$ , there are $n_1\ 1$ 's, $n_2\ 2$ 's, $\cdots$ , $n_d\ d$ 's, we have actually constructed a histogram mapping $\varphi: (i_1,\cdots,i_n)\to (n_1,\dots,n_d)$ with the restriction that $n_1+\cdots+n_d=n$ . Based on different histogram $d$ -tuple $(n_1,\dots,n_d)$ , we can further subgroup the summands in sum $(3)$ as follows. For a specific histogram distribution $(n_1,\dots,n_d)$ , by merging same factors, the polynomial part of $(3)$ becomes $(x_1-a_1)^{n_1}\cdots(x_d-a_d)^{n_d}$ . So, $(3)$ can be rewritten in accordance with this subgrouping as $$\sum\limits_{\begin{array}{c}(n_1,\dots,n_d)\in\Bbb N^d\\n_1+\cdots+n_d=n\end{array}}c_{(n_1,\dots,n_d)}(x_1-a_1)^{n_1}\cdots(x_d-a_d)^{n_d}.$$ This looks much like the power series form. If we take partial derivative $\frac{\partial^{n}f}{\partial x_1^{n_1}\cdots\partial x_d^{n_d}}$ and plugging in $(a_1,\dots,a_d)$ , all other terms not corresponding to this $(n_1,\dots,n_d)$ tuple will vanish either because the exponent is less or because the factor is evaluated to zero, and not surprisingly we get the coefficient in exactly the same form as ones in the power series form: $c_{(n_1,\dots,n_d)}=\frac{1}{n_1!\cdots n_d!}\frac{\partial^n f(a_1,\dots,a_d)}{\partial x_1^{n_1}\cdots\partial x_d^{n_d}}=\frac{1}{n_1!\cdots n_d!}\frac{\partial^n f(a_1,\dots,a_d)}{\partial x_{i_1}\cdots\partial x_{i_n}}$ since $f$ is $C^\infty$ and therefore changing the order in which variables are taken does not change the result of mixed partial derivative. But the denominator before the mixed partial derivative is supposed to be $n!$ from the ground truth in $(2)$ as opposed to $n_1!\cdots n_d!$ . I know I must have committed some error by messing up something during the derivation, but I cannot spot it. So, could you please help me figure out the error so that I can correct it and eventually derive the coefficients in the second form having expected $n!$ in the denominator. Thank you.","['partial-derivative', 'multivariable-calculus', 'combinatorics', 'taylor-expansion']"

I know that for $T > 0, \; u \in \mathbb R$ the process $M_{t\land T}^{u,X}=\exp( i u X_{t\land T}+\frac{1}{2}u^{2}(t\land T))$ is a local martingale too.

you. The person refuses to reveal the vector to you; however, you may
supply another vector with integer entries, and they will tell you the
result of taking the dot product with the hidden vector. A straightforward way to extract the value at the $i$ -th index is to supply the vector $(0, 0, \ldots, 1, \ldots, 0)$ - where the number $1$ occurs at the $i$ -th position. Doing this for all values of $i$ lets you recover the hidden vector in number of steps equal to the length of the vector. Is there a shorter way to just extract the absolute value of the largest entry (or an upper bound for the same) in this set-up? For example, if it is known that all the entries happen to be positive integers, one can supply the vector $(1, 1, \ldots, 1)$ and obtain an upper bound for the largest entry in a single step. Also, if it happens that it is not possible to do this in fewer than $n$ steps (where $n$ is the length of the vector), could you please refer me to a proof for why this is the case? Another variant of the question - is it possible to determine the positions of the negative numbers in the vector in fewer than $n$ steps? Edit: I came across a variant of this question a while ago. The set-up was almost identical, except the vector had positive integer entries instead of just integer entries. The solution involved finding an upper bound $M$ for the largest term (exactly as I have outlined above, and then taking the dot product with the vector $(1, M, M^2, \ldots, M^{n-1})$ to get a number whose base- $M$ expansion was the entries of the vector. I found this really interesting, and I was wondering if this could be generalized to either the full set of integers or the rationals. Since it seems unlikely that one will be able to determine the full vector in fewer than $n$ steps, I am interested in knowing whether it will be possible to determine a simpler property - such as the positions of the negative entries - in fewer than $n$ steps.","['coding-theory', 'linear-algebra', 'vectors', 'information-theory']"

3985773,Connection Between Ãtale Fundamental Group and Topological Fundamental Group,"I have some problems with the understanding of the theory of fundamental groups. I hope everything I write down here is understandable and correctly written. Let $X$ be a (smooth) complex algebraic variety. Realize the variety as a complex manifold $X(\mathbb{C})$ . This question is concerned about the connection between the Ã©tale fundamental group $$\pi_1^{\text{Ã©t}}(X,x)$$ and the topological fundamental group $$\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x).$$ More precisely, I would like to understand how I can describe the Ã©tale fundamental group by using the classical fundamental group - which should be, if I'm not mistaken; $$
\pi_1^{\text{Ã©t}}(X,x)=\widehat{\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)},
$$ where the right hand side denotes the profinite completion of the topological fundamental group. There are a few facts I have proven. Let me begin by mentioning them. Proven Results Statement 1. If we let $X$ denote a topological space with base point $x$ , $\mathbf{Cov}(X)$ denote the category of covering spaces over $X$ , and $\pi_1(X,x)-\mathbf{Sets}$ be the category of sets equipped by a group action by the fundamental group. Then we have the following equivalence of categories $$
\mathbf{Cov}(X)\simeq \pi_1(X,x)-\mathbf{Sets}
$$ Also, I have proven the following two statements: Statement 2. If $\mathbf{G}$ is a group considered as a category and $P_{\mathbf{G}}:\mathbf{G}-\mathbf{Sets}\to\mathbf{Sets}$ is the forgetful functor, then $$
\mathbf{G}\cong \operatorname{Aut}(P_{\mathbf{G}}),
$$ where $\operatorname{Aut}(P_{\mathbf{G}})$ is the automorphism group of $P_{\mathbf{G}}$ . Statement 3. If $\mathbf{\hat{G}}$ denotes the profinite completion of $\mathbf{G}$ and $\hat{P}_{\mathbf{G}}:\mathbf{G}-\mathbf{FinSets}\to\mathbf{FinSets}$ is the forgetful functor from the category of profinite completion actions on finite sets to the category of finite sets, then $$
\mathbf{\hat{G}}\cong\operatorname{Aut}(\hat{P}_{\mathbf{G}}).
$$ Lastly, we also have the following theorem called The Riemann Existence Theorem, which can be found in Lectures on Ãtale Cohomology by James Milne (see page 28): Riemann Existence Theorem. Let $X$ be a nonsingular variety over $\mathbb{C}$ . The functor sending a finite Ã©tale covering $(Y,\pi)$ of $X$ to the finite covering space $(Y(\mathbb{C}),\pi)$ of $X(\mathbb{C})$ is an equivalence of categories. A Quest to Prove the Isomorphism I had a discussion with a professor (not too long ago) over Zoom, he told me that the above is enough to find the connection between the fundamental groups. But I am not exactly sure how. In the notes, this is how professor Milne gave the proof From the Riemann Existence Theorem it follows that the Ã©tale universal
covering space $\widetilde{X}=(X_i)_{i\in I}$ of $X$ has the property
that every finite topological covering space of $X(\mathbb{C})$ is a
quotient of some $X_i(\mathbb{C})$ . Let $x$ any element of $X(\mathbb{C})$ . Then $$\pi_1^{\text{Ã©t}}(X,x)=\varprojlim_i\operatorname{Aut}_X(X_i)=\varprojlim_i\operatorname{Aut}_{X(\mathbb{C})}(X_i(\mathbb{C})) =\widehat{\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)}.$$ I cannot see how anything I have proven comes into the picture in the above quotation. Questions Question 1. To use the results I have proven I guess I would like to put $\mathbf{G}=\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)$ in Statement 2 and Statement 3? This gives us $$
\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)\cong\operatorname{Aut}(P_{\mathbf{G}})
\\
\widehat{\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)}\cong \operatorname{Aut}(\hat{P}_{\mathbf{G}})
$$ where do I go from where? Question 2. To make The Riemann Existence Theorem more compact, let $\mathbf{FinÃtCov}(X)$ denote the category of finite Ã©tale coverings of $X$ and $\mathbf{FinCov}(X(\mathbb{C}))$ denote the finite covers of the topological space. Then the theorem says $$
(1)\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\mathbf{FinÃtCov}(X)\simeq\mathbf{FinCov}(X(\mathbb{C}))
$$ As given in Statement 1, I have the following equivalence $$(2)\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\mathbf{Cov}(X(\mathbb{C}))\simeq \pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)-\mathbf{Sets}.$$ The two equivalence just given are not exactly the same, but ""almost"". Can I use the above equivalence somehow? I am quite sure I cannot do it like this, but something similar to $$\mathbf{FinCov}(X(\mathbb{C}))\simeq\pi_1(X(\mathbb{C}),x)-\mathbf{Sets}?$$ I don't think I can use the above because $(1)$ is about finite covers, when $(2)$ is not. After having done the above, then I could replace the fundamental group, with the automorphism group of the forgetful functor. But this seems just like it is making things much more complicated for me. I'm just trying to use all of the results I have proved. Â´Something which bothers me is that I want to prove that two groups are isomorphic. But right now, everything I am doing is at a category-theoretical level - which makes me confused. I want to do things at a group-theoretic level. Question 3. At the end of the day, I would like someone to help me put everything together. Maybe someone can give me a guiding hand and tell me how this relates to what Milne did? Maybe there are more work to do before I can prove the isomorphism? I would be really happy if someone could help me get a better understanding of this problem. Best wishes, Joel","['fundamental-groups', 'algebraic-geometry', 'category-theory', 'algebraic-topology']"

By letting $L_u,\, L_d: s= \xi\pm iR,0\leq \xi\leq \gamma$ , where $\gamma$ is the real number that the vertical line of the given contour passed by.

Working with my $L_u$ with $ML$ inequality, i have $L=\gamma$ . Assuming $-\pi<\operatorname{arg}{s}\leq \pi$ and parametrizing $s=-\xi+iR$ , $\xi\in [-\gamma,0]$ : $\begin{align}
\left|\int_{L_u}\right| 
&\leq \left|e^{st} \log\left(1 + \frac 1s\right)\right|\\
&\leq \left|e^{-\xi t}\right| \left|e^{iRt}\right|\left|\ln\left|1+ \frac{1}{-\xi+iR}\right| + i\pi\right|\\
&\leq 1\cdot 1 \cdot \ln\left(1+\frac 1R\right) + \pi\\
&\approx \frac 1R + \pi
\end{align}$ Combining the $ML$ i have $$\frac{\gamma}{R} +\gamma\pi$$ Which does NOT approach to $0$ . Why? Please spot my mistake. I can't think about how to make it goes to $0$ since yesterday. Hope you kind to help me. New Edit : Now my main question is not about ML. I managed to set the big and small arc goes to $0$ . My main question now is ""is it possible to evaluate this by using inversion formula (without differentiate both sides) and use log form instead?"" What i mean by differentiate both sides is: $$\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}^{-1} &= \operatorname{Log}\left(\frac{s+1}{s}\right)\\
(\mathcal{L}^{-1})' &= \frac{1}{1+s} - \frac{1}{s}
\end{align}$$ I don't want this kind of solution. What i really want is evaluating $\operatorname{Log}\left(\frac{s+1}{s}\right)$ by inversion formula. That's it.

3986650,"Does dx in dA=dx*dy represent change, or is it a notation that denotes an infinitesimal arbitrary length?

I've so far had calc 1 and 2, and have been taught that dy/dx represents a slope, which represents a change. So, my current understanding is if I had a function dy/dx(x) and plugged in x, I could deduce how much of a change in y I could expect, if I moved a unit x, at that particular x of interest. Where my understanding falls apart is, I don't see how dx in a slope, which represents change, would also represent ""change"" in dA=dx*dy. I mean in the classical meaning of the word change. I know we could say ""well in the same way delta X is a change in x and represents length"", but I don't view it as such. Not sure if this is related, but here's another thing bothering me, say we have P=dF/dA. Why dF and not only F? I understand dA would represent this infinitesimal area, but what does dF represent then? It's supposed to be a change in F, right? Why do we need a change?

We now look at the subsequences $a^{(1)}\circ q^{(1)},a^{(2)}\circ q^{(1)},\ldots,a^{(k)}\circ q^{(1)}$ where the first one is monotonic, while others don't have to be. Again, from the lemma, there is a strictly increasing sequence $q^{(2)}:\Bbb N\to\Bbb N$ s. t. $a^{(2)}\circ q^{(1)}\circ q^{(2)}$ is a monotonic subsequence of $a^{(2)}\circ q^{(1)}$ . Since a subsequence of a monotonic sequence is also monotonic, among the subsequences $a^{(1)}\circ q^{(1)}\circ q^{(2)},a^{(2)}\circ q^{(1)}\circ q^{(2)},\ldots,a^{(k)}\circ q^{(1)}\circ q^{(2)}$ , the first two are monotonic, while others don't have to be. We repeat the process $(k-2)$ more times and obtain the subsequences $a^{(1)}\circ p,a^{(2)}\circ p,\ldots,a^{(k)}\circ p$ , where $p=q^{(1)}\circ q^{(2)}\circ\cdots\circ q^{(k)}$ . To avoid confusion, let $d:\Bbb N\to\Bbb N$ take the role of the strictly increasing sequence $p:\Bbb N\to\Bbb N$ from the corollary of the lemma. Now, every sequence in $\Bbb N$ has a minimum element, so, if some of the sequences $a\circ d,b\circ d,c\circ d$ happen to be decreasing , at some point they should become constant and hence monotonically increasing so, e.g., if $a'=a\circ d$ is decreasing $$\space m_a=\min\{m\in\Bbb N\mid\space a'_l\ge a'_m,l> m\},$$ and if we similarly define $m_b,m_c$ (if necessary), $p=\max\{m_a,m_b,m_c\}$ , and any $q\ge p$ should work as we end up with three monotonically increasing sequences $a\circ d,b\circ d,c\circ d$ starting from the index $p$ .

$ Context: This ultimately ties back to a homework assignment. (Specifically it's from Fundamentals of Matrix Calculations by Watkins, Exercise $2.1.30$ from $\S2.1$ but that's not really a huge deal, seems like a fairly common exercise.) The goal is to show that, knowing matrix $p$ -norms are induced by the corresponding vector norms, $\forall A \in \R^{n\times n}$ , $$\|A\|_\infty = \max \limits_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k}|$$ I have an approach and was just curious as to how valid it is; I just don't feel very sure of myself. I feel like I made some sort of small-yet-critical mistake somewhere, but I can't figure out where... My Attempt: Ultimately, we will show that $$\max \limits_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k}| \le \|A\|_\infty \le \max \limits_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k}|$$ which will let me conclude with the desired equality ( $a \le b \le a \implies a=b$ ). From the definition of the $\infty$ -norm, with $A := (a_{i,j})_{1 \le i,j \le n} \in \R^{n \times n}$ and $x := (x_i)_{1 \le i \le n} \in \R^n$ , $$
\inorm{Ax} = \max_{1 \le i \le n} \abs{ \sum_{k=1}^n a_{i,k} x_k }
$$ Applying the triangle inequality yields $$
\inorm{Ax} \le \max_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k} x_k|  = \max_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k}| \cdot | x_k|
$$ Note that $$
|x_k| \le \max_{1 \le j \le n} |x_j| =: \norm{x}_\infty
$$ and thus $$
\inorm{Ax} \le  \max_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k}| \cdot \norm{x}_\infty 
$$ $\norm{x}_\infty$ is independent of $i$ , so we factor it out and conclude $$
\inorm{Ax} \le \norm{x}_\infty \para{ \max_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k}| }
$$ Thus, $$
\inorm{A} = \max_{x \ne \vec 0} \frac{\inorm{Ax}}{\inorm{x}} \le \frac{\displaystyle \norm{x}_\infty \para{ \max_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k}| }}{\norm{x}_\infty} = \max_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k}|
$$ Thus, with $\inorm{A}$ less than or equal to the desired expression, we need to find an $\hat x$ such that equality is achieved. Suppose in row $r$ the maximum is achieved; for every $k$ , let $$
\hat x_k = \begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } a_{r,k} \ge 0 \\
-1 & \text{if } a_{r,k} < 0
\end{cases} = \mathrm{sign}(a_{r,k})
$$ Define $\hat x := (\hat x_i)_{1 \le i \le n}$ as defined above; clearly $\inorm{\hat x}=1$ . This ensures $a_{r,k}\hat x_k = |a_{r,k}|$ . Then \begin{align*}
\norm{A}_\infty
&=  \max_{x \ne \vec 0} \frac{\inorm{Ax}}{\inorm{x}}  \tag{def. of matrix norm} \\
&\ge \frac{\inorm{A \hat x}}{\inorm{\hat x}} \tag{def. of maximum}\\
&= \inorm{A \hat x} \tag{$\inorm{\hat x} = 1$} \\
&= \max_{1 \le i \le n} \abs{ \sum_{k=1}^n a_{i,k} \hat x_k } \tag{definition}\\
&=  \abs{ \sum_{k=1}^n a_{r,k} \hat x_k } \tag{definition of $r$}\\
&=  \abs{ \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{r,k}| } \tag{choice of $\hat x_k$, $r$}\\
&=   \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{r,k}|  \tag{$|z| \ge 0 \implies \sum_i |z_i| \ge 0$}\\
&= \max_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k}| \tag{def. of $r$}
\end{align*} Thus what we have seen is that $$
\max_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k}| \le \norm{A}_\infty \le \max_{1 \le i \le n} \sum_{k=1}^n |a_{i,k}|

Here is my work so far, $y=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x)^{n+r}$ , $y'=\sum_{n=0}^\infty(n+r)a_n(x)^{n+r-1}$ , $y''=\sum_{n=0}^\infty(n+r)(n+r-1)a_n(x)^{n+r-2}$ Substitute the above series into the given ODE, $x^2[\sum_{n=0}^\infty(n+r)(n+r-1)a_n(x)^{n+r-2}]+(x+x^2)[\sum_{n=0}^\infty(n+r)a_n(x)^{n+r-1}]-(1-2x)[\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x)^{n+r}]=0$ $\sum_{n=0}^\infty(n+r)(n+r-1)a_n(x)^{n+r}+\sum_{n=0}^\infty(n+r)a_n(x)^{n+r}+\sum_{n=0}^\infty(n+r)a_n(x)^{n+r+1}-\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x)^{n+r}+2\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x)^{n+r+1}=0$ Now shift the index so all series are of $x^k$ , $\sum_{k=r}^\infty k(k-1) a_{k-r}x^k+\sum_{k=r}^\infty k a_{k-r}x^k+\sum_{k=r+1}^\infty (k+1) a_{k-r-1}x^k-\sum_{k=r}^\infty a_{k-r}x^k+2\sum_{k=r+1}^\infty a_{k-r-1}x^k=0$ $\sum_{k=r}^\infty [k(k-1)+k-1]a_{k-r}+\sum_{k=r+1}^\infty [(k+1)+2]a_{k-r-1}x^k=0$ Expand the first summation for $k=r$ , $r(r-1)+r-1]a_0x^r+\sum_{k=r+1}^\infty [k(k-1)+k-1]a_{k-1}x^k+\sum_{k=r+1}^\infty [(k+1)+2]a_{k-r-1}x^k=0$ Choose the largest root $r_1=1$ and further collect the series under one grouping, $0a_0x^r+\sum_{k=2}^\infty([k(k-1)+k-1]a_{k-1}+[(k+1)+2]a_{k-2})x^r=0$ Now set the coefficients equal to zero to find the recurrence relation, $[k(k-1)+k-1]a_{k-1}+[(k+1)+2]a_{k-2}=0$ , for all $k\geq2$ $a_{k-1}=-\frac {k+3}{k^2-1}a_{k-2}$ , for all $k\geq2$ Now this is where I begin to fail in finding the first solution. As I choose values of k, there is no observable pattern for the coefficients of $a$ .

3987205,Invertibility of $I-A^s$ for each $s \geq 1$ implying nilpotence,"If $R$ is a unital ring and $x \in R$ a nilpotent element, then $1-x$ is a unit, and so is $1-x^s$ for any $s \geq 1 $ since powers of $x$ are again nilpotent. My question concerns the converse of this statement in the case in which $R = M_n(\mathbb{C})$ , that is: Question 1: if $A \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a square matrix with complex entries and $I-A^s$ is invertible for all $s \geq 1$ , what conditions can we impose on $A$ to guarantee that it is nilpotent? Some condition has to be in place, as the general statement is already false in dimension $1$ . In that case, the matrices $1-a^n$ will be always invertible whenever $a$ is not a root of unity, and the only nilpotent element is zero. More generally, any diagonal matrix $\mathrm{diag}(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ of non-zero elements that are not roots of unity will do the trick. Here's a partial result, If $\{\det(I-A^n)\}_n \subset \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ converges, then either the spectrum of $A$ is contained in $B_1(0)$ . In particular,
if $A$ has integer coefficients then it is nilpotent. A proof follows: let $c_n := \det(I-A^s)$ and $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n \in \mathbb{C}$ be the eigenvalues of $A$ , counted with multiplicity. Then $$
(1-\lambda_1^s) \cdots (1-\lambda_n^s) = c_s 
$$ is a convergent subsequence. Noting $d_s = \prod_{i \ : \ |\lambda_i| \neq 1}(1-\lambda_i^s)$ , we then have $$
\prod_{i \ : \ |\lambda_i| = 1}(1-\lambda_i^s) = c_s/d_s \to L.
$$ with either $L = 0$ or $L = \lim_s c_s$ , depending on whether there are eigenvalues with absolute value greater than $1$ . If has some eigenvalue outside the unit disc, the right hand side converges and moreover the left hand side has some non-trival factor. Observe that since $c_n$ is never zero, no $\lambda_i$ can be a root of unity; and so we are left with showing that if $k \geq 1$ and $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k \in [0,1)$ are irrational then $$
a_s := \prod_{j = 1}^k(1-e^{i2\pi\alpha_j s}) 
$$ does not converge to $0$ nor $\lim_s c_s$ . By Dirichlet's approximation theorem, for each $k \geq 1$ we can find a natural number $s_k$ and an integer $p_k$ for which $|s_k\alpha_j - p_k| < 1/k$ , and thus there is a subsequence $(s_k)_k$ for which $e^{i2\pi\alpha_j s_k} \to 1$ for all $j$ , and $a_{s_k}\to 0$ . But then taking $s'_k = s_k+1$ yields $e^{i2\pi\alpha_j s_k'} \to e^{i2\pi\alpha_j s}$ and $a_{s_k'} \not \to 0$ . Hence $(a_s)$ never converges. Are there results in this direction whose proof is purely algebraic? In particular, can we recover the former partial results without doing analysis ? It seems to me like there is some relation between the spectrum of $A$ and the fact that $I-A^s$ being invertible implies the invertibility of $\sum_{i = 0}^s A^i$ , the limit of the latter - were to exist- being the inverse of $I-A$ . Is there a reference for this statement, at least in the case in which $\det(I-A^s) = \pm 1$ for each $s$ and $A$ has integer coefficients? I suspect this specific case can be proved in a purely algebraic fashion but so far I haven't been able to come up with a proof. Here's what I've done so far: Suppose that $f = \chi_A = X^m g, g = (X-\lambda_1) \cdots (X-\lambda_k)$ with $X \not \mid g$ . Note $p^{(m)}$ the polynomial whose roots are the $m$ -th powers of $p$ 's roots. Then our hypothesis is precisely that $f^{(m)}(1)$ is always a unit in $\mathbb{Z}$ . Thus, the same holds for $g$ , write $g = p_1 \cdots p_r$ where $p_j \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ are irreducible. Since no eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ is a root of unity, once again by Kronecker's  theorem each $p_j$ has a - possibly complex - root of absolute value greater than $1$ . Moreover the proof notes that in general if $p \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ then $p^{(m)} \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ , so in any case, we have $$
\pm 1 = g^{(m)}(1) = p_1^{(m)}(1) \cdots p_r^{(m)}(1)
$$ and so $p_j^{(m)}(1) = \pm 1$ . This allows us to reduce the original problem to: Attempted Subproblem 1. Let $f = \prod_{i=1}^k (X-\alpha_i) \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ be an irreducible monic polynomial. If $f^{(m)}(1) = \pm 1$ for each $m \geq 1$ , where $f^{(m)} = \prod_{i=1}^k (X-\alpha_i^m)$ , then $f = X$ . Since $\det(I-A^s) = \pm 1$ for all $s$ , dividing by $\det(I-A)$ gives $\det(\sum_{i=0}^s A^i) = \pm  1$ for all $s$ . This yields a pretty large sum of all monomials $x_{i_1}^{j_1} \ldots x_{i_r}^{j_r}$ where $\{i_1, \ldots, i_r\} \subset \{1,\ldots, k\}$ and $j_t \in \{0,\ldots, s\}$ , being equal to $\pm 1$ . Maybe there's some underlying interpretation in terms of symmetric polynomials.","['alternative-proof', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'nilpotence', 'linear-algebra']"

Such questions should be directed to those employed by the institution in question, or other qualified individuals who know your specific circumstances. Closed 3 years ago . Improve this question I'm currently in my final year of a math undergrad degree and need to start writing my senior capstone. I've recently gotten very interested in the concept of set theory and have read through some information online and most recently I finished Halmos's Naive Set Theory. I was speaking to my advisor about the possibility of writing a set theoretic definition of the real numbers, but he seems concerned that giving a thorough explanation will be too long. My capstone prompt is incredibly broad:  write at least 10 pages about something to do with math. I'm overwhelmed by the possibilities and feel like everything I come across would take 20-30 pages minimum to describe. Although it's not a specific math solution I'm looking for, I was wondering if anyone has any relatively simple concepts that they find interesting or even a book/article suggestion so I have somewhere to start?

3987287,Multiplying a ring(or an ideal) by an element.,"I was looking at a proof of the statement: Given a ring $R$ and an ideal $M$ , $R/M$ is a field $\iff$ M is maximal. The backwards direction (assume $M$ maximal) proof involved a statement where we take an $r\in R$ such that $r\notin M$ and take $M + r*R$ which is an ideal as $M$ and $R$ are ideals, which implies that this construction must be $R$ itself. I had two questions about this statement. First of all, I realized very quickly that for a given ring $r*R\neq R$ . Is this simply because $R$ is not a group under $*$ , i.e., if $R$ were a field, would $r*R=R$ , or is there something else going on? If it's because of the group assumption, what would the reasoning behind a proof be (I assume something to do with existence and uniqueness of inverses but not 100% sure)? The second was assuming that $r*R$ is an ideal. By definition of an ideal I know $r*R\in R$ , but by the above question there's no guarantee that $r*R=R$ . How then do we know that $r*R$ is an ideal?","['ring-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'ideals']"

3987316,Extension of the concept of summation.,"I am not a mathematician and I am just asking this question out of my curiosity. $Warning:$ This question might not have the right tags. In an infinite series: $\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}}a_n$ , if you create a set $S_0=$ { $a_k|k\in\mathbb{N}$ },then $Cardinality(S_0)=âµ_0$ We know that we can write integrals( $â«$ ) as riemann sums then it seems like adding infinitely many infinitesimal amounts and getting a finite value. Like $\int_{C}a_n dn$ where $C$ is a continuous curve Now if we let $S_1=$ { $x|x\in C$ }(The set of all point in $C$ ) Then $Cardinality(S_1)=\aleph_1$ So it seems like integral is an extension of regular summation to higher cardinality. Integral is the continuous counterpart of regular sums and regular sum is the discrete counterpart of integral. So finally my question is that: Is it possible to extend the concept further to higher and higher cardinalities or is my question nonsense? (I am not a mathematician that is why I couldn't describe my question in a precise way, but I still hope that my question is understandable and answerable)","['integration', 'elementary-set-theory', 'set-theory', 'sequences-and-series']"
