286902,Combinatorial problem: constructing certain subsets of a set of size eight.,"I'd like to find eight subsets $S_1$, $S_2$,$\ldots$,$S_8$ of $\{1,2,3,\ldots,8\}$ with the following properties: 1) Each $S_i$ has size 3, and each $i$, $1\leq i\leq 8$, is in precisely three of the $S_i$. 2) The $S_i$ have a unique ""system of distinct representatives"". That is, there is only one way of choosing elements $x_i\in S_i$ such that all the $x_i$ are
distinct, or equivalently that $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_8\}=\{1,2,3,\ldots,8\}$. I don't know whether such subsets should exist. I tried starting with $S_i=\{i,i
+1,i+2\}$ (modulo 8), so e.g. $S_5=\{5,6,7\}$ and $S_8=\{8,1,2\}$; this satisfies (1), and then I tried messing around changing a few elements about to get (2) to work, but I failed. There's a finite field of size 8 but I couldn't see a natural
way of constructing eight subsets of size 3 that would work. Similarly there's a
finite field of size 9 but I couldn't see a natural way of constructing eight subsets of its multiplicative group of size 3 that would work. This sort of thing
is a long way from my area and I thought I should ask in case I'd missed something.",['combinatorics']

286918,"Continuous, Bounded Normed Linear Spaces","For $f$ in $C[a, b]$, define $||f||_1 = \int_a^b |f|$. Show that this is a norm on $C[a, b]$. Also, show that there is no number $c\geq0$ for which $||f||_{\max}\leq c||f||_1$ for all $f$ in $C[a,b]$, but there is a $c\geq0$ for which $||f||_1\leq c||f||_{\max}$ for all $f$ in $C[a,b]$. Solution: Part 1: Let $f\in C[a,b]$, $g\in C[a,b]$, and $\alpha \in \Re$. a) (Triangle- Inequality) $||f+g||_1 = \int_a^b |f+g| \leq \int_a^b |f| + \int_a^b |g| = ||f||_1 + ||g||_1$ b) (Positive Homogeneity) $||\alpha f||_1 = \int_a^b |\alpha f| = |\alpha| \int_a^b |f| = |\alpha| ||f||_1$ c) From my book (Royden ""Real Analysis"" 4th): (Nonnegativity) $||f||\geq 0$ and $||f|| = 0$ if and only if $f=0$. So, does this mean $||f||\geq 0$ and $||f|| = 0$ which implies just $||f|| = 0$? Or $||f||\geq 0$ or $||f|| = 0$? I took it to mean the former. So, Let $||f||_1||\geq 0$ and $=0$. $0=||f||_1 = \int_a^b |f|$ $0=||f||_1 = \int_a^b |f|$ = $F(b)-F(a) = 0$, so $F(b) = F(a)$ which either means that $a=b$ or $f=0$. Since $a\neq b$, $f=0$. Conversely, let $f=0$. Then, $||f||_1 = \int_a^b |f| =\int_a^b |0| = 0$. Part 2: I understand the second part: ""but there is a $c\geq0$ for which $||f||_1\leq c||f||_{\max}$ for all $f$ in $C[a,b]$"". Intuitively, we can say that this is true because if you make a box with base $|b-a|$ and height $f_{\max}$, the area will always be at least as much as the area under the curve. $||f||_1 = \int_a^b |f| = |F(b)| - |F(a)| \leq |F(b) - F(a)|$. Let $c=|b-a|$, then $ c||f||_{\max} \geq ||f||_1$ by definition of the integral. How can I say this more mathematically? The first part I am having more trouble comprehending. Since $f$ are continuous, there is no infinite value of any $f$. So, let $||f||_{\max} = N$, then couldn't $c=N$ and $||f||_{\max}\leq c||f||_1$ for all $f$ in $C[a,b]$?","['normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
286925,On the equality of the sum of a set and the product of a set.,"Questions: For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, does there exist a set $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\} \subset \mathbb{Q}$, such that $$\prod_{k=1}^{n}s_k = \sum_{k=1}^{n}s_k$$ (EDIT: and the sum and product are non-zero) If not, can the upper bound for $n$ be shown, such the above is true for $n$ less than the bound? (for the above and/or the following questions) The same as question one, but with the added restriction that the elements of $S$ are integers ? The same as question one, but with the added restriction that the least element in $S$ is $1$? I came up with this problem when looking at the set $\{1, 2, 3\}$.  I noted that $1+2+3 = 6 = 1\cdot2\cdot3$.  This was quite interesting, and I looked for other sets with this property, and easily noted $\{-1, -2, -3\}$ and the trivial $\{1\}$ and $\{0\}$.  Not so easily noted was $\{\frac{-4}{7}, \frac{-1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\}$. Thinking of sets of four or more numbers was more difficult.  But, I noted that $\{\frac{-6}{5}, \frac{-1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, 2\}$ also satisfies this property. I was curious if anyone here might have some insight. EDIT: I just realized that the proof of question 1 is simple:
For odd $n$, let the set be $\{0, s_1, -s_1, s_2, -s_2, (etc.)\}$.  Thus, the sums cancel out, and the multiplication cancels because of $0$. For even $n$, let the set be similar: $\{0, s_1, s_2, -(s_2+s_1), s_3, -s_3, s_4, -s_4 (etc.)\}$ Thus, let question one have the restriction that the resulting equality cannot be $0=0$, to make it more interesting.",['number-theory']

286958,Prove the Probability of Two Events,"I'm taking my first course in Probability and one of my homework problems is to prove that for any two sets: 
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $$ Note that the function $P$ is the probability of an event happening.  From the third axiom, we are given that for any two disjoint sets, that is $ A \cap B = \emptyset$: $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$ My thought process follows from this third axiom, but I run into a problem near the end: Since $A$ and $B$ are disjoint sets, $P(A)=P(A-B)$ and $P(B)=P(B-A)$, so $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)=P(A-B)+P(B-A)$$ From this, it appears that we are essentially taking the symmetric difference of A and B.  This, to me, seems to be equivalent to: $$P(A-B)+P(B-A)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$$ Hence, by my logic: $$P(A \cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$$ Which, in essence, doesn't care whether two sets are disjoint or not as we are subtracting the intersection of them.  If the sets are disjoint, then the intersection is merely null.  If they intersect, then we are removing the ""extra pieces"". I feel like this is inadequate proof despite my ability to convince myself that it is true..  Where, if anywhere, did I go wrong? Thanks!","['statistics', 'probability', 'probability-theory']"

I haven't yet learned much about measure theory and probability. I am mainly just curious if there is a ""formula"" for Bayes' rule in measure theory? And interested in anything relevant. One motivation is we often model a game in economics by have a finite set of states of the world with a prior distribution, then we learn that the true state is in some subset and update based on Bayes rule.

286970,A question related to Buffon's needle,"The following is an elementary probability question related to a generalization of the famous ""Buffon's needle experiment"" which allows one to estimate $\pi$ by counting how many times a randomly tossed needle crosses a line on a lined sheet of paper.  If we replace the needle with a rigid wire in the shape of any piecewise smooth plane curve, I believe it is well-known that the expected number of line crossings depends only on the length of the wire and not on its specific shape. I am seeking an elementary proof of this fact in the case where the wire consists of two line segments joined end-to-end.  The only parameters here are the lengths of the two line segments and the angle at which they are joined; I would like to prove that the expected number of crossings depends only on the sum of the lengths.  If it helps, I am happy to assume that both line segments are very small compared to the spacing between the lines on the paper.  Any ideas? Added: Several have argued that this follows simply from the linearity of expectation, but I am not convinced.  Suppose it were the case that the expectation for a single segment of length $\ell$ was given by $\ell^2$.  Then if $X$ and $Y$ are the random variables representing the two needles making up the wire we would have $E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = \ell_X^2 + \ell_Y^2$, and this is not a function of $\ell_X + \ell_Y$ (though it is a function of $\ell_X$ and $\ell_Y$).  Of course we secretly know that $E(X) = C \ell_X$, but my goal in asking this question is to prove this fact without actually calculating anything.","['geometry', 'probability']"

Let $O\subseteq [0,1]/\sim$ be an open set, let $[x]\in O$. Then $\pi^{-1}O$ is open so there is $\varepsilon >0$ so that $B(x,\varepsilon)\subseteq \pi^{-1}O$. Then there is a rational $q$ so that $d(x,q)<\varepsilon / 3$ therefore $[q]\in \pi B(x,\varepsilon)\subseteq O$. Let $\delta>0$ be such that $\pi B(q,\delta)\subseteq \pi B(x,\varepsilon /3)\subseteq O$. Let $y$ be a point in $[0,1]$. Then there is a rational $q$ with $d(y,q)<\delta$.

287001,cohomological proof of Maschke's theorem,"I have been working on the following problem. . I have spent plenty of time trying to solve it myself. I am, however, unable to prove one small step in the argument. Beneath you can find my attempt. Step 2 (showing that $D$ is a principal derivation) is not so clear to me. I guess there must be some direct argument that says that $H^1(G, k^{m \times n}) = 0$, rather than doing explicit calculations. Any help or advice is appreciated. Thanks. 1) We first show that $D: G \to k^{m \times n}$ is a derivation. For this we check that $D(gh)=gD(h) + D(g)$. \begin{eqnarray*}
gD(h) + D(g) &=& g \cdot [ C(h) B^{-1}(h) ] + C(g)B^{-1}(g) \\
&=& A(g)C(h)B^{-1}(h)B^{-1}(g) + C(g)B^{-1}(g) \\
&=& A(g)C(h)B^{-1}(gh) + C(g)B^{-1}(g) \\
&=& [A(g)C(h) + C(g)B^{-1}(g) B(gh) ] B^{-1}(gh) \\
&=& [A(g)C(h) + C(g)B^{-1}(g) B(g) B(h) ] B^{-1}(gh) \\
&=& [A(g)C(h) + C(g) B(h) ] B^{-1}(gh) \\
&=& C(gh)B^{-1}(gh) \\
&=& D(gh)
\end{eqnarray*} The second last step can be understood by looking at the matrix representation of $\rho$. When one uses the fact that $\rho(gh)=\rho(g)\rho(h)$ and looks explicitly at the matrix multiplications one sees the desired identity in the right-top corner. 2) I don't see why $D$ is principal... 3) First bring $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & M \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}^{-1}$ to the right hand side. Next work out the left and right-hand matrix multiplications explicitly:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{pmatrix} A(g) & C(g) + M B(g) \\ 0 & B(g) \end{pmatrix} &=& \begin{pmatrix} 1 & M \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} A(g) & C(g) \\ 0 & B(g) \end{pmatrix}  \\
&=& \begin{pmatrix} A(g) & 0 \\ 0 & B(g) \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 & M \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \\
&=& \begin{pmatrix} A(g) & A(g) M \\ 0 & B(g) \end{pmatrix}
\end{eqnarray*} Taking the identity of the right-top corners, we get that $C(g) + M B(g) = A(g)M$. This is the condition that must hold such that we have $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & M \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} A(g) & C(g) \\ 0 & B(g) \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 & M \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} A(g) & 0 \\ 0 & B(g) \end{pmatrix}$$
But this condition is satisfied whenever $D$ is a principal derivation. When this is the case, there exists an $M$ such that
$$C(g)B(g)^{-1} = D(g)= g \cdot M - M = A(g) M B(g)^{-1} - M$$
or
$$C(g) = A(g) M - M B(g)$$
or
$$C(g) + M B(g) = A(g)M$$
which was the desired result.","['homological-algebra', 'representation-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Given that $X$ is an arbitrary topological space, $Y$ is a totally ordered set in the order topology, and $f$, $g \colon X \to Y$ are continuous functions, how to show that the subset $A$ of $X$ given by 
$$ A \colon= \left\{ \ x \in X \  \colon \  f(x) \leq g(x) \ \right\} $$ 
is closed in $X$? Edit based on the answer by Hagen von Eitzen: Let $U \colon= \{ u \times v \in Y \times Y \ \colon \ u < v \ \}$. We show that $U$ is open in $Y \times Y$. Let $u \times v \in U$. Then $u < v$. Case I. If there is some $y \in Y$ such that $u < y < v$, then $u \times v \in (-\infty, y) \times (y, +\infty) \subset U$. Case 2. If $(u,v)$ is empty, then $u \in (-\infty, v)$ and $v \in (u, +\infty)$, and so $u \times v \in (-\infty, v) \times (u, +\infty)$. Moreover, if $a \times b \in (-\infty, v) \times (u, +\infty)$, then we must have $a < v$ and $b> u$. So $a \leq u < v \leq b$, which implies that $a < b$ and so $a \times b \in U$. Thus, $u \times v \in (-\infty, v) \times (u, +\infty) \subset U$. So $U$ is open in $Y \times Y$. Similarly, we can show that the set 
$$V \colon= \left\{ \ u \times v \in Y \times Y \ \colon \ u > v \ \right\}$$ is open in $Y \times Y$. Thus, it follows that the set $A \colon= \{ \ u \times v \in Y \times Y \ \colon \ u \leq v \ \}$ is closed in $Y \times Y$. Now since the maps $f \colon X \to Y$ and $g \colon X \to Y$ are continuous, so is the map $f \times g \colon X \to Y \times Y$ defined as
$$(f \times g)(x) \colon= f(x) \times g(x) \ \mbox{ for all } \ x \in X.$$ Thus, the inverse image under $f \times g$ of the set $A$ is closed in $X$. But 
$$ 
\begin{align} 
(f \times g)^{-1} (A) &= \left\{ \ x \in X \ \colon \ (f \times g)(x) \in A \ \right\} \\

287309,Group mean vector and common group covariance matrix in discriminant analysis?,"I'm looking over the answers for old statistics exams in preparation for my own exam, while reviewing a question concerning discriminant analysis I found something really odd. I have input variables and a class label for each observation x1 = [2, 10, 6, 14, 6, 10]
x2 = [8, 6, 4, 10, 12, 8]
t  = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2] Normally for DA I would calculate the mean for each group (both groups have mean 8) however the exam asks for the 'group mean vectors' which according to the answers should be: u1 = [6, 6]
 u2 = [10, 10] However I can't find anywhere how these were calculated. A Google search for 'group mean vector' turns up nothing and if I search for Discriminant Analysis methods all I find is using the means for each group (scalars not vectors). The second strange things happens in calculating the covariance matrix. Instead of calculating one covariance matrix for both groups, they ask for a ""common group covariance matrix"" (again Google is useless here, so strange!) Apparently you have to calculate a matrix per group first and then add these for both groups together (cell per cell) and divide each cell by 2. For x1 this 'group matrix' is: top_left = 0.5[(2-6)^2 + (6-6)^2 + (10-6)^2 = 16
bottom_right = 0.5[(8-6)^2 + (6-6)^2 + (4-6)^2 = 4
others = 0.5[(2-6)(8-6) + (10-6)(6-6) + (6-6)(4-6) = -4

287541,Question regarding the Kolmogorov-Riesz theorem on relatively compact subsets of $L^p(\Omega)$.,"Usually, the Kolmogorov-Riesz theorem is quoted for $L^p(\mathbb R^n)$, but I am looking for versions considering spaces over subsets in $\mathbb R^n$. The following is from the book ""Sobolev spaces"" by Adams and Fournier: Theorem. Let $1\leq p < \infty$. A bounded subset $K \subseteq L^p(\Omega)$ with $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ a domain is precompact in $L^p(\Omega)$ if and only if for every number $\varepsilon >0$ there exists a number $\delta >0$ and a subset $G \subset \subset \Omega$ such that for every $u\in K$ and $h \in \mathbb R^n$ with $|h| < \delta$ both of the following inequalities hold:
  $$\int_\Omega |\tilde u(x+h) -\tilde u(x)|^p\,dx <\varepsilon^p \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{\Omega \setminus \overline G} |u(x)|^p\,dx < \varepsilon^p.$$ Here, $\tilde u$ is defined by $\tilde u = u$ on $\Omega$ and $\tilde u = 0$ on $\mathbb R^n\setminus \Omega$. The theorem is obtained by proving the version for $\mathbb R^n$ and applying this to $\tilde K = \{\tilde u : u \in K\}$. In a book by Brezis (""Analisis functional, Theoria y aplicaciones""), the following theorem is stated: Corollary. Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ be open and let $\mathscr F$ be a bounded subset of $L^p(\Omega)$ with $1\leq p <\infty$. Suppose that $\forall \varepsilon >0 \; \forall \omega \subset \subset \Omega,\;\exists \delta >0,\;\delta < \mathrm{dist}(\omega,\Omega^c) \text{ such that } \|\tau_h f -f\|_{L^p(\omega)} < \varepsilon \quad \forall |h|<\delta \text{ and } f\in\mathscr{F}.$ $\forall \varepsilon >0 \; \exists \omega \subset \subset \Omega \text{ such that } \|f\|_{L^p(\Omega\setminus\omega)} < \varepsilon \quad \forall f \in \mathscr F$ Then $\mathscr F$ is relatively compact in $L^p(\Omega)$. Here, $\tau_h$ denotes the operator $\tau_h f(x) = f(x+h)$. (Disclaimer: I translated this from the Spanish version of the book and I really don't know any Spanish (the original version is in French; unfortunately there is no English version).) The crucial part here is that the first property need only be tested on $\omega \subset \subset \Omega$. Using the Theorem from Adams and Fournier, the statement of Brezis should also characterize relative compactness, since $\|\tau_h f - f\|_{L^p(\omega)} \leq \|\tau_h \tilde f - \tilde f\|_{L^p(\Omega)}$ for every $\omega \subset \subset \Omega$. My question is this: Does anybody know if there are other references (preferably in English) where relative compactness is characterized by the properties in the Corollary of Brezis? As a follow-up, are there references which deal with relative compactness in the case of weighted $L^p$-spaces? Specifically, I'm interested in the case where the weight takes the form $e^{-\varphi}$ for some $C^2$ function $\varphi$. One probably could take the proofs for non-weighted spaces and adapt them, but I guess one would have to deal with adjusting the necessary tools (e.g. smoothing by convolution) to the weighted case, hence a reference would be nice.

287552,"Binomial Theorem identities, evaluate the sum","This is a homework problem, please don't blurt out the answer! :) I've been given the following, and asked to evaluate the sum: $$\sum_{k = 0}^{n}(-1)^k\binom{n}{k}10^k$$ So, I started out trying to look at this as equivalent to the binomial theorem, in which case, I could attempt something like this: $10^k = y^{n-k}$ but I didn't feel that got me anywhere. So I started actually evaluating it... $$(-1)^0\binom{n}{0}10^0 + (-1)^1\binom{n}{1}10^1 + \ldots + (-1)^n\binom{n}{n}10^n$$ So, if I'm thinking correctly, all the other terms cancel out and you are left with: $$(-1)^n\binom{n}{n}10^n = (-1)^n10^n$$ But, obviously this cannot be correct (or can it?).

287556,Is there an irreducible polynomial vanishing on two components? (In the Zariski sense),"The polynomial

is an example of an irreducible polynomial in $\mathbf{R}[x,y]$ which is irreducible but whose zero set has multiple components in the Zariski topology (since $V(f)$ is four distinct points). This is an answer to exercise 12 in section 1 of Hartshorne. However, all the examples (of irreducible polynomials over $\mathbf{R}[x,y]$ with reducible zero sets) I can come up with look like this; i.e. their zero sets are just finite collections of points. My question is this: Is there an irreducible polynomial in $\mathbf{R}[x,y]$ whose zero set has multiple components (w.r.t the Zariski topology) that are not points ? NOTE : By ""multiple components"", I mean components in the Zariski topology. So you might guess something like $xy-1$ or $y^2-x^3+x$, since their zero sets each clearly have two components in the Euclidean topology. For one of those polynomials to be an answer, however, there would need to be some polynomial whose zero set is the left piece and another whose zero set is the right piece.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'polynomials']"

Then $f$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$. I try to prove this statement, and I think one can prove it as follows: consider $f(1/z)$. $0$ cannot be an essential singularity of $f(1/z)$, for the big Picard theorem would imply that on any neighborhood of $0$ $f(1/z)$ takes on all possible complex values (with at most one exception) infinitely often, but this is contrary to $|f^{-1}(\left\lbrace w\right\rbrace)|\leq n$. Then $f(1/z)$ has a pole of order $k$ say, and since $f$ is holomorphic it is a polynomial of degree $k$ (for its principal part vanishes). By the fundamental theorem of algebra, $k\leq n$.

We randomly sample $n$ elements $x_1 $, $x_2$, $\ldots$, $x_n$ (without replacement, so $x_1\ne x_2$ etc). Using the method of moments to approximate $\theta$, I get $E(X)=\bar{x}$, so a estimator $\hat m$ for  $m $ can be found through solving  $\frac{\hat m}{2}=\bar{x}$, hence $\hat m=2\bar{x}$, where $\bar{x}=\frac{x_1+x_2+...+x_n}{n}$. I was asked to find $Pr(2\bar{x}<\max(x_1,x_2,...,x_n))$ for n=2 (since when this is true our estimate for $m$ is clearly incorrect). Of course, this is trivial, since we get $Pr(\frac{2(x_1+x_2)}{2}<\max(x_1,x_2))=Pr(x_1+x_2<x_1)\cup Pr(x_1+x_2<x_2)=0$. It's fairly obvious, however, that for values of $n$ greater than 2, this is not the case. In class my teacher mentioned solving for this probability by hand gets increasingly difficult as $n$ gets larger, but it should be fairly doable for $n=3$. I'm just curious as to how one would approach this. I'm not really sure what the joint pmf for $x_1+x_2+x_3$ is (they're not independent, I believe), and also a little confused as to where I would set the bounds on the triple integral that follows. (If its not clear, I'm looking for $Pr(x_1+x_2+x_3<\frac{3\max(x_1,x_2,x_3)}{2}))$ I realize that this is not a practical approach really (the book suggests using simulations for higher values of n to approximate the probability), and that the MOM is not a great way to do this in general, but I'm curious nonetheless! Any thoughts? Edit: While unable to actually come up with the proper integral, I used some simulations in R to determine that the proper answer is $\frac{1}{8}$, I'm not sure if that helps anything but I figured I'd put it up here just in case.","['statistics', 'probability', 'integration']"

287866,"""Fat"" Cantor Set","So the standard Cantor set has an outer measure equal to $0$ , but how can you construct a ""fat"" Cantor set with a positive outer measure? I was told that it is even possible to produce one with an outer measure of $1$ . I don't see how changing the size of the ""chuck"" taken out will change the value of the outer measure. Regardless of the size, I feel like it will inevitably reach a value of $0$ as well... Are there other constraints that need to be made in order to accomplish this?","['real-analysis', 'cantor-set']"

A number from 1 to 1000 is selected at random. What is probability that the last two digits of  it's cube are equal to 1? The book reports that the  answer is .01. I believe the  answer follows from the fact that number $100x^2+10y+z$ cubed has the form $(100x^2+10y+z)^3$ = A trinomial expansion and using this knowledge to somehow show that there are only two solutions and each is 1/10 likely.,"['elementary-number-theory', 'probability']"
287913,Non-measurable set with infinite outer and inner measure,"It's a well known theorem that a set with finite outer measure is measurable if and only if its outer and inner measure agree. I need to justify the assumption that the outer measure of the set is finite, i.e., an example of a non-measurable set with outer and inner measure both infinite.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
287917,How to show $AB^{-1}A=A$,"Let $$A^{n \times n}=\begin{pmatrix} a & b &b & \dots & b \\ b & a &b & \dots & b \\ b & b & a & \dots & b \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\ b & b & b & \dots &a\end{pmatrix}$$
  where $a \neq b$ and $a + (n - 1)b = 0$.
  Suppose $B=A+\frac{11'}{n}$ , where $1=(1,1,\dots,1)'$ is an $n \times 1$ vector. Show that $AB^{-1}A=A$ Trial: Here $B^{-1}=\frac{1}{\alpha-\beta}I_n-\frac{\beta~11'}{(\alpha-\beta)(\alpha+(n-1)\beta)}$ Where $(\alpha-\beta)=(a+\frac{1}{n}-b-\frac{1}{n})=(a-b)$ and $\alpha+(n-1)\beta=1$ So, $B^{-1}=\frac{1}{a-b}[I_n-(b+\frac{1}{n})11']$. Then pre and post multipling $A$ I can't reach to the desire result . Please help.","['matrices', 'inverse']"
