633368,Good ODE Books That Explain How Solution Methods Came To Be and Their Justifications,"As part of the mathematics program offered at my college, I took an introductory ODE course a few semesters back.  This was the one math course in my entire college career that I was totally lost in.  Even after pursuing additional information through my instructor and scouring countless other ODE books, I have no idea how the various methods of solutions for ODEs came to be.  They are all non-obvious to me--well, all except for separation of variables--and really seem quite contrived. What is a good book or online resource that conveys ODE solution methods in an easy to understand way?  The book I used for my course was ""Fundamentals of Ordinary Differential Equations"" by Nagle, Saff, and Snider and it was very much written for those people who really only wanted or needed an algorithmic way to find solutions.  What I am really looking for are some explanations for why certain methods work, how they work, and how they came to be from a theoretical standpoint, because right now they all seem like lucky guesses and don't seem interconnected at all. If you can suggest some books or online resources, that would be great.  Please provide some rationale for why you think the resource is good.  No modeling needs to be covered in the resource as that is rather simple.","['online-resources', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'reference-request']"
633371,How to compute $\lim_{n\to \infty}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n^2+n-k^2}}$,"Find  this follow limit

You can show there is an analytic branch of $\sqrt{1-z^2}$ defined on $\mathbb{C}\setminus\sigma$. Question: What are the possible values of $\displaystyle\int_{\gamma} \frac{dz}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}$ ? Guess at answer: The set of values $2\pi k$ for integer $k$. It feels to me like I should be able to reduce the situation to the integral $\displaystyle\int_{-1}^{+1} \frac{dz}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}$ on the segment of the real axis, then take advantage of the fact that the integral $\displaystyle\int_{+1}^{-1} \frac{dz}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}$ on the segment with the opposite orientation, and using the other branch of the function, does not cancel the first integral. Another thought that I had was to try to relate the integral to a winding number.

633939,Zeilberger's determinant evaluation problem,"Doron Zeilberger posted a question here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1532 of evaluating the determinant of a very sparse matrix. The $2d \times 2d$ matrix $M(d)$ has ones in the pattern $1,0,1,0,1,0,\dots$ in both the subdiagonals and the superdiagonals. And $M_{b-1,2b}=M_{3b+1,2b-1}=-1$, for all $b$. The entries are zero everywhere else. This matrix happens to be related to the Collatz Conjecture, in that the matrix is nonsingular for all $d$ iff there are no nontrivial cycles of the Collatz function iteration. See http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/mamarim/mamarimhtml/detconj.html If one swaps all odd and even columns, $2b-1$ and $2b$, one gets all ones on the diagonal of this matrix. Then if one performs Gaussian elimination, one gets an upper-triangular matrix with all ones on the diagonal (for any $d$); therefore, the matrix is nonsingular. I verified this on a spreadsheet. If this doesn't convince you, here is a formal proof: (Invalid formal proof) We'll prove the conjecture that $\det M(d)=(−1)^d$, via induction on $d$. It's trivial to check for $d=1,2$. We'll assume true for $d=k$ and prove true for $d=k+1$. We'll use Laplace expansion (by cofactors) along column $2d−1$ to prove that the $\det M(d)=(−1)^d$. Notice that this column has only one nonzero entry in the last row, namely 1; therefore, $\det M(d)=(−1)^{2d+(2d−1)}M_{2d,2d−1}=−M_{2d,2d−1}$. Suppose $d$ is odd. Then to evaluate $M_{2d,2d−1}$, we use Laplace expansion along row $2d−1$. Then $M_{2d,2d−1}=(−1)^{(2d−1)+(2d−1)}\det M(d−1)=\det M(d−1)$, since the only nonzero entry is in column $2d$, which is 1. Hence, $\det M(d)=−M_{2d,2d−1}=−\det M(d−1)=(−1)^d$, by the induction hypothesis. Suppose $d$ is even. Then to evaluate $M_{2d,2d−1}$, again we use Laplace expansion along row $2d−1$. There are two nonzero entries in this row, namely the one in column $2d$, which is 1, and the one in column $d+1$, which is -1. Then we get $M_{2d,2d−1}=(−1)^{(2d−1)+(2d−1)}M(d−1)+(−1)^{(2d−1)+(d+1)}\cdot (−1)\cdot 0=\det M(d−1)$. The last term is zero, because row $d+2$ has all zeroes when column $d+1$ is deleted. Hence, $\det M(d)=−M_{2d,2d−1}=−\det M(d−1)=(−1)^d$, by the induction hypothesis. QED What am I missing here? This was way too easy.",['matrices']
633947,Lower bound on the size of a maximal matching in a simple cycle,"Let $C_n$ denote an undirected simple cycle of $n$ nodes. I want to determine a lower bound on the size of a maximal matching $M$ of $C_n$. Please note: A subset $M$ of the edges in $C_n$ is called a matching $\Leftrightarrow$ every node $v\in C_n$ is incident to at most one edge in $M$. The matching $M$ is called maximal $\Leftrightarrow$ it cannot be extended to a larger matching by adding an edge which is not already contained in $M$. Proof: Let $M$ denote a maximal matching in $C_n$. Since
$(v_{2i-1},v_{2i})_{1\le i\le \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor}$ is a matching in $C_n$, |M| must be greater or equal to $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$. The Assumption $|M|\ge\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor +1$ leads to $|\left\{v\in C_n\;|\;\exists w\in C_n : (v,w)\in M\vee (w,v)\in M \right\}|\ge \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor+2$, contrary to $|C_n|=n$. Am I missing something or is everything as it should be? I'm a little bit confused, because the exercise only asked for a lower bound. EDIT: Okay, I was confused by the terms maximum matching and maximal matching . Let me try to provide a proof for a lower bound of a maximal matching: I think its easier to construct a maximal matching and show that it can't be reduced while maintaining its maximality. Let $C_n=(v_0,\dots,v_{n+1})$ with $v_{n+1}=v_0$. Please consider the sequence $S:=(v_{3i},v_{3i+1})_{0\le i\le \lfloor\frac{n}{3}\rfloor -1}$ if $n$ is uneven, extend $S$ by $(v_{n-1},v_n)$. $S$ induces a matching $M$ of $C_n$ with $|M|=\lceil\frac{n}{3}\rceil$. If $M'$ is also a matching of $C_n$ with $|M'|<|M|$, then there exists an natural number $k\le n-1$ such that neither $v_k$ nor $v_{k+1}$ participates in any edge of $M'$. So, $M'$ cannot be maximal.","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

The the image of the unit ball in $X$ is weak-* dense in the unit ball of $X^{**}$ . My proof idea Assume $X^{**}$ is equipped with its weak-* topology.
Let $Q$ be the isometric map from $X$ to $X^{**}$ such that $Q(x)(\pi) = \pi(x)$ . Denote by $Q(B_x)$ the image of the unit ball $B_x$ in $X$ . Now for every $ y \in Q(B_x)$ if $\|y\| < 1$ then $Q(B_x)\subset B_{x^{**}}$ where $B_{x^{**}}$ is the unit ball in $X^{**}$ . But this is equivalent to showing that every vector in the complement of the closure of the $Q(B_x)$ has norm greater than $1$ . (*) Let $Q'(B_x)$ denote the closure of $Q(B_x)$ in $X^{**}$ . Take $ \pi \in X^{**}\setminus Q'(B_x)$ . As $Q'(B_x)$ is closed and $\{\pi \}$ is  compact, by the Hahn-Banach seperation theorem, we have that there exists a continuous linear functional $\omega': X^{**} \to \mathbb{C}$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\text{Re}(\omega'(\pi)) \leq \alpha \leq \text{Re}(\omega'(y))$ for all $y \in Q'(B_x)$ .

634020,Exercise: Every non-empty subset of $X$ contains a minimum and maximum element and the converse,"Hi everyone is my second exercise of posets. And find the following, the first part I think is not difficult at all. But for the converse I have some serious troubles to prove it. I have two questions: Is the following correct? and second, there is some constructive proof  for the second statement assuming that this is correct? Any advice, suggestion would be great. Thanks in advance Lemma : Suppose  $Y$ is a poset and let $X \subset Y$ be a finite totally ordered set. Then every non-empty subset of $X$ contains a minimum and maximum element. Conversely, if $X$ is a totally ordered set and every non-empty subset of $X$ has both minimum and maximum element. Then the set is finite. Proof: Suppose $X$ is a finite totally ordered set and let $P(n)$ be the statement: ""If $X$ is a finite totally ordered set with $n$ elements then every non-empty subset of $X$ contains a maximum and minimum element"". The assertion is vacuously true when $n=0$, since $X$ is empty and it does not contain a non-empty subset. Now suppose we have already proven the assertion for $n\ge 0$; we'd like to show that also is true when $\,\#X=n+1$. Clearly $X$ is a non-empty set, then it contain an element $x_0\in X$. Let define $X'= X \backslash \{x_0\}$. Then $X'$ contain $n$ elements and every non-empty subset of $X'$ contain a minimum and maximum element by the inductive hypothesis. Suppose $F$ is a given non-empty subset of $X$. Then either $x_0\in F$ or $x_0 \notin F$. For the former, let $F'= F\backslash \{x_0\}$, so $F'\subset X'$ and  contain a maximum and minimum element. Let $a$ and $b$ be the maximum and minimum element respectively. So, we need to compare $x_0$ with $a,b$ (this is always possible because $X$ is totally ordered) in the case that $a < x_0 $ or $x_0<b$ but not both at the same time (if were $a<x_0<b$, i.e., $a<b$ which is not possible ), we set this as the maximum or minimum element of the set. The case when $x_0\notin F$ is trivial because $F\subset X'$. Thus the claim hold in any case as desired. Conversely, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $X$ is an infinite totally ordered set and each non-empty set of $X$ contain a maximum and minimum element. We define the elements $x_n$ recursively by setting $x_0 = \text{min} (X)$ and $x_{n+1}= \text{min}(\{ x\in X: \forall i \le n\, (x\not=x_i) \})$. This definition is well-define since $X$ is assume to be an infinite set and each subset contain a minimum element by hypothesis. We claim that for all $n,m\in \mathbb{N}$ if $n<m$ then $x_n<x_m$. Let us fix $n$ an suppose by contradiction that exist an element for which the claim is false. Let $m_0$ be the least element. So, $x_n\ge x_{m_0}$ and $n< m_0$. Since $x_{n}<x_{n+1}$, then $m_0\not= n+1$. It follows that $m_0=k+1$ and thus $x_k<x_{m_0}$. By transitivity $x_k < x_n$ which contradicts the minimality of $m_0$. Then the result follows by reductio ad absurdum. Then we have and increasing sequence $x_0 < x_1 <...<x_n...$ of elements of $X$. Let define $(x_n):=\{x\in X: x\le x_n \}$ (notice that this sets are non-empty for all $n$) and $X':= \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty (x_n)$. Clearly $X'\subset X$, then it has a maximum element by hypothesis, let call it $x_{max}$. Then $x_{max} \in X'$, i.e., $x_{max} \in (x_n)$ for some $n\in \mathbb {N}$. But $x\le x_n$ and if we set some  $m>n$ we therefore have $x_{max}< x_m$ which is a contradiction.","['self-learning', 'elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory']"

Now, he says that if $f(x) = (f_1(x),\ldots,f_m(x))$ then $Df(a) = (Df_1(a),\ldots,Df_m(a))$. This seems simple enough, and the proof is very easy, but he follows it up by saying that the matrix of this map, denoted $f'(a)$, is the matrix with $f_i'(a)$ as the $i$th row.

I've proved in group theory countless times that the integers are closed under addition. It's obvious to me that they are. However this has just put a little bit of a spanner in the works and I'd like to see your thoughts on this. Take the infinite sum: $S = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 +... = \frac{1}{1-x}$ for $x<1$. [The geometric series is only convergent for $|x| < 1$.  Maybe this is part of the issue. ---PLC] [There are many other cases of these, take the well known one from physics that $\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}^\inf n  = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3+.. = \frac{-1}{12}$] A well known result. Now let's differentiate this, with respect to $x$. $\frac{d S}{dx} = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3+ ...= \frac{1}{(x-1)^2}$ Now treating $S$ as a function of $x$ let's substitute in $x = -1$ This gives $S = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... = \frac{1}{4}$ Now I have a sum of integers added together and I get: $\frac{1}{4}\notin \mathbb{Z}$ Thus the integers are not closed under addition. Now I assume the problem here is as always: infinity . The gap between infinite sums and normal sums always seems to provide these little strange problems.

I believe this essentially makes this a ""set of sets"", if we treat an interval in time (e.g. [513, 936]) as a set.  Let's call this set of sets $I_d$. To find overlaps in $d$ and another device $e$'s sessions, we can take the ""cross intersection""(?) (like cross product but instead of pair-wise multiplication pair-wise intersection of $d$ and $e$'s intervals).  This leaves us with a set of sets where each set describes an overlapping period in time during which $d$ and $e$ where concurrently connected to $p$. My first question : Is there any notation for the ""cross intersection"" I describe? Here's my stab at describing how encounters are inferred from the dataset: If $d$ and $e$ are two devices connected to AP $p$ for interval sets
  $S \in [{d_p}^{i}, {d'_p}^{i}] \forall i$ and $T \in [{e_p}^{j},
> {e'_p}^{j}] \forall j$, then $d$ and $e$ encounter at $p$ during
  intervals $u \in S \,crossIntersect\, T$ where $u \ne \emptyset$. My second question : Aside from the almost certain technical wrongness of the notation above, could you please provide suggestions on how the notation could be improved, whether this be choice of letters, symbols or other notational conventions? As you will have gathered I'm pretty amateur at this and this is probably one of the easier questions on this site, so I'm hoping this is still an appropriate venue.","['notation', 'elementary-set-theory']"
634376,What can be computed by axiomatic summation?,"Here are three simple properties one might require of a summation method for divergent series: A stable summation scheme is one in which (assuming also each sums are defined iff the other is) $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n = a_1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{n+1}$$ A linear one satisfies (whenever the RHS is defined) $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty (\kappa a_n+b_n) = \kappa\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$$( Edit: Added $\kappa$, that was forgetfulness.) A regular one agrees with normal summation when both are defined. (That is, if one has a convergent series, it is given its normal value by the summation method.) If one assumes these rules, what class of series may be computed? It sounds like it should be the set of series which differ by a convergent series from another which is periodic up to rescaling; i.e. $a_n = c_n + k^n p_n$ where $\sum c_n$ is convergent and $p_{n+m} = p_n$ for some $m$. Is that correct? ( Edit: Clearly this guess should have been $c_n + \sum_{i=1}^M k_{(i)}^n p_{(i) n}$, thanks Karene. Further, I was already aware of the issue whereby stability gives contradictions to e.g. $1+1+\cdots$ so my conjecture should also have reflected that.) Given a specific, arbitrary series not of this form, can one actually/necessarily either (a) find two stable, linear, regular summation schemes for which the sum is defined, but for which we get distinct results; or (b) prove that no such scheme can define a value for the sum? (Motivation: pure curiosity.)","['divergent-series', 'linear-algebra', 'sequences-and-series', 'summation']"

Where $U$ is the confluent hypergeometric function. I did some simplification in the hope of making things simpler: $$C(t) = \frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{\alpha}{2}+ \frac{1}{2}\right) U\left(\frac{1}{2},1-\frac{\alpha }{2},-i t \alpha \right)}{\Gamma \left(\frac{\alpha }{2}\right)}$$
$$= \frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{\alpha}{2}+ \frac{1}{2} \right) \Gamma \left( 1-\frac{\alpha}{2} \right) }{\Gamma \left(\frac{\alpha }{2}\right) \Gamma \left( 1 -\frac{\alpha}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right) \Gamma \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)}.\int^1_0 e^{-i t^2} t^{-\frac{1}{2}}  (1-t)^{-\frac{\alpha }{2}-\frac{1}{2}}dt \;\;(1)$$
Using the properties of the gamma function and this post here ` Rewrite $\Gamma(-z)$ in terms of $\Gamma(z)$ I was able to simplify (If my math is correct) , 
$$\frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{\alpha}{2}+ \frac{1}{2} \right) \Gamma \left( 1-\frac{\alpha}{2} \right) }{\Gamma \left(\frac{\alpha }{2}\right) \Gamma \left( 1 -\frac{\alpha}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right) \Gamma \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)} = \frac{-2 *\pi * \sin(\pi(1+\alpha)) (\Gamma \left( \alpha \right) )^2}{\sin(\pi(1+\frac{\alpha}{2}))}$$

Here is how I proved it: According to (???), we can find a (unique?) ""flow curve"" $\gamma:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying:
  $$\dot \gamma(t) = \nabla F(\gamma(t))$$
  $$\gamma(0) = 0$$
  Look at $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}:t \mapsto F(\gamma(t))$. It satisfies $\dot f(t) = \nabla F(\gamma(t)) \cdot \dot \gamma(t) = ||\dot \gamma(t)||^2 > 1$, and $|f(0)| \le 1$. By a simple 1-dimensional calculus argument, there is a $t_0 \in \left[-1, 1\right]$ such that $f(t_0) = 0$. The length of the arc $\gamma$ between the origin and our zero is $$\left|\int_0^{t_0} ||\dot \gamma(t)||\,dt\right| \stackrel{\text{Cauchy-Schwarz}}{\le}\sqrt{|t_0| \cdot \left|\int_0^{t_0} ||\dot \gamma(t)||^2\,dt\right|} = \sqrt{|t_0| \cdot \left|\int_0^{t_0} \dot f(t)\,dt\right|} \le \sqrt{|t_0 f(0)|} \le 1$$
  so the distance between $x = \gamma(t_0)$ and $0$ is at most $1$. My questions: Is the proof correct? What is the justification for the existence of $\gamma$?
