1737459,"what does linearly independent in C[0, 1] mean?","This is a question from my textbook I'm not quite sure what C[0, 1] mean, I tried to google the similar question and found that $C[0,1]$ usually denotes the collection of continuous functions $f: [0,1]\to \mathbb{R}$, but I'm still not quite sure what $f: [0,1]$ means, does $[0,1]$ means the domain of the function, can anyone give me a straightforward example","['linear-algebra', 'functions', 'vector-spaces']"
1737470,Parallel transport along a closed geodesic,"It do Carmo, in exercise 9.4, it is claimed that parallel transport along a closed geodesic in an even-dimensional orientable manifold ""leaves a vector orthogonal to the geodesic invariant."" So, let $\gamma:[0,a]\to M$ be this geodesic, with $\gamma(0)=\gamma(a)=p$, and let $V\in T_pM$ be orthogonal to $\gamma'(0)$. Let $P_t$ be the parallel transport along the geodesic. From Picard-LindelÃ¶f, it is clear that $P_a\gamma'(0)=\gamma'(a)$. Let $V(t):=P_t V$. I believe the claim is that $V=P_aV$. It is clear that $\langle V(a),\gamma'(0)\rangle=0$, so $V(a)$ lies in the same $\gamma'(0)$-orthogonal subspace ($T_pM^\bot$) as $V$. Let $E_1,\dotsc,E_{n-1}$ be an orthonormal basis of this subspace. Extend these via parallel transport along the geodesic. Then $E_1(a),\dotsc,E_{n-1}(a):=P_aE_1,\dotsc,P_aE_{n-1}$ is also an orthonormal frame of $T_pM^\bot$. Since $P_t$ preserves orientation (I have already proved this), there is an $O\in\mathrm{SO}(n-1)$ such that $E_i(a)=\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}O_i{}^jE_j$. At this point I get stuck. I see no reason for $O$ to be the identity or what $M$ being even-dimensional has to do with anything. How do I continue?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
1737476,Posterior Predictive Distribution for a coin toss,"In this question, i can work out that the posterior is supposed to be a Beta (r+1, n-r+1) distribution. However, what I am struggling with is how to compute f(X_n+1|theta). Is this the binomial distribution with r+1 replacing r, because it's the probability of achieving r+1 heads in X_n+1 flips? Or is it simply theta, because it's the probability of seeing an (r+1)th head in 1 extra flip, having observed r heads in n flips? Obviously depending on which is the correct f, the answers vary significantly. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks a lot","['bayesian', 'statistics']"
1737482,Confused about the definition of subspace,"The definition from my textbook is: A subspace of a vector space is a set of vectors that satisfies
  two requirements: If $v$ and $w$ are vectors in the subspace and $c$ is any
  scalar, then (1) $v + w$ is in the subspace. (2) $cv$ is in the subspace. And my textbook says vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$
but let say $V=\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}$ and $W=\begin{pmatrix}c\\d\end{pmatrix}$, so $V$ and $W$ are all in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and clearly $V+W$ is in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $cV$ or $cW$ is in $\mathbb{R}^2$ too, so the first two requirements are met, why we say $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$? It looks like we have to add $V$ and $W$ should be in $\mathbb{R}^3$ as well, but why we don't have this in the definition?","['linear-algebra', 'vector-spaces']"

1737538,Are these two metric spaces complete?,"Let $J$ be an arbitrary non-empty set of indices, and let $\mathbb{R}^J$ denote the set of all the $J$-tuples of real numbers (i.e. the set of all the functions $x \colon J \to \mathbb{R}$, where we denote $x(\alpha)$ by $x_\alpha$, for each $\alpha \in J$). Now let the function $\tilde{\rho} \colon \mathbb{R}^J \times \mathbb{R}^J \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined as follows: 
$$ \tilde{\rho}( x, y) \colon= \sup \left\{ \ \min \left\{ \ \vert x_\alpha - y_\alpha \vert, \ 1 \ \right\} \ \colon \ \alpha \in J \ \right\} \ \mbox{ for all } \ x \colon= \left(x_\alpha \right)_{\alpha \in J}, \ y \colon= \left(y_\alpha \right)_{\alpha \in J} \in \mathbb{R}^J.$$
This function $\tilde{\rho}$ is of course a metric on $\mathbb{R}^J$, called the uniform metric. Is the metric space $\left( \ \mathbb{R}^J, \  \tilde{\rho} \ \right)$ complete? My effort: Let $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $\left( \ \mathbb{R}^J, \  \tilde{\rho} \ \right)$, and let $x_n \colon= \left( x_{\alpha n} \right)_{\alpha \in J}$, for each $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$. Then, given any real number $\epsilon > 0$, we can find a natural number $N = N(\epsilon)$ such that 
$$ \tilde{\rho}(x_m, x_n ) < \epsilon \ \mbox{ for all } \ m, n \in \mathbb{N} \ \mbox{ such that } \ m> N \ \mbox{ and } \ n> N. $$
Let's assume that $0< \epsilon < 1$. Let $\beta \in J$. Then for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m > N$ and $n > N$, we have 
$$\epsilon > \tilde{\rho}(x_m, x_n) \geq  \min \left\{ \  \left\vert x_{\beta m} - x_{\beta n} \right\vert, \ 1 \ \right\} = \left\vert x_{\beta m} - x_{\beta n} \right\vert,$$
which shows that the sequence $\left(x_{\beta n} \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}$, and so this sequence converges to some real number $x_\beta$. Now since our $\beta \in J$ was arbitrary, let us define
$x \colon= \left( x_\alpha \right)_{\alpha \in J}$. Is this logic correct so far? If so, then how to proceed from here, especially if the index set  $J$ is infinite? Now let's take $J$ to be the set $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers, and let's denote $\mathbb{R}^J$ by $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ and define the function $D \colon \mathbb{R}^\omega \times \mathbb{R}^\omega \to \mathbb{R}$ by the formula
$$ D(x, y) \colon = \sup \left\{ \frac{ \min \left\{ \ \left\vert x_\alpha - y_\alpha  \right\vert, \ 1 \ \right\}}{\alpha } \ \colon \ \alpha  \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} \ \mbox{ for all } \ x \colon= \left( x_\alpha  \right)_{\alpha \in \mathbb{N}}, \ y \colon= \left( y_\alpha \right)_{ \alpha \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathbb{R}^\omega.$$
Then $D$ is also a metric on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, and the topology induced by $D$ is the same as the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Is the metric space $\left( \ \mathbb{R}^\omega, \ D \ \right)$ complete? Let $\left(x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, where $x_n \colon= \left( x_{\alpha n} \right)_{\alpha \in \mathbb{N}}$ for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, be a Cauchy sequence in $\left( \ \mathbb{R}^\omega, \ D \ \right)$. Let $\beta$ be a fixed natural number. Then, given any real number $\epsilon > 0$, we can find a natural number $N = N(\epsilon)$ such that
$$ D(x_m, x_n) < \frac{ \epsilon}{ \beta} \ \mbox{ for all } \ m, n \in \mathbb{N} \ \mbox{ such that } \ m > N \ \mbox{ and } \  n > N. $$
Let's assume that $0 < \epsilon < 1$. Then for all natural numbers $m$ and $n$ such that $m, n > N$, we have 
$$\left\vert x_{\beta m} - x_{\beta n} \right\vert < \epsilon,$$
from which it follows that the sequence $\left( x_{\beta n} \right)_{ n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a Cauchy sequence of real numbers and therefore this sequence converges to some real number $x_\beta$. Since our $\beta \in \mathbb{N}$ was arbitrary, we can define an element $x \in \mathbb{R}^\omega$ as $$x \colon= \left( x_\alpha \right)_{\alpha \in \mathbb{N}}.$$ Is my logic correct so far? If so, then how to proceed from here? What if, in either of the above two cases, we replace $\mathbb{R}$ by an arbitrary complete metric space (and replace $\vert \cdot \vert$ by the corresponding distance of course)? Do we still have a metric in either case? And, if so, is (are) this (these) metric(s) complete?","['real-analysis', 'complete-spaces', 'general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'analysis']"

1737591,Integration of a $k$-form over chains,"In Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds , he defines the integral of a $k$-form over a $k$-chain, and proves a version of Stokes' theorem for this situation, before moving on to discuss the integral of a differential form over a manifold.  Other books, such as Introduction to Smooth Manifolds by Lee and Analysis on Manifolds by Munkres, seem to skip this step.  They define the integral of a $k$-form over a $k$-manifold without mentioning or proving theorems about $k$-chains.  (Am I correct about that?) What is the advantage (if any) of Spivak's approach?

1737661,Coordinate free Geometric Algebra vs. Linear Algebra,"I think I know what coordinate free means. But I never found in ANY text a good explanation of it or something like: This is the problem solved with coordinates and this is the problem solved without coordinates, etc. Since the philosophy of GA is that everything should be coordinate free, I would like to see an example of something that can be done in GA without coordinates but you have to use coordinates with usual linear algebra. To be specific, in GA you can make something like this in, let's say $\mathbb{G_3}$: $c=(bab)I$ The vector $a$ is rotated about the vector $b$, and then you take the dual plane of it. Is there an efficient way to do this without coordinates in linear algebra?

1737687,Doubt on the Krull topology on infinite Galois extension,"A pre-base (in fact a base)  of the topologycal group G of the infinite Galois extension $F/K$ is given by $\sigma Gal(F/F_i) $ with $F_i/K$ finite Galois subextension. 
Those opens are uniquely identified by the property $f|_{F_i} =\sigma|_{F_i}$. 
If we now consider $\sigma Gal(F/F_j) \cap \tau Gal(F/F_i) $ we can get: The null set if $\tau$ and $\sigma$ doesn't agree on $F_i\cap F_j$ $\gamma Gal(F/F_iF_j) $ otherwise where $\gamma$ is the extension to $F$ of the map on $F_iF_j$ which behave as $\sigma$ on $F_i$ and as $\tau$ on $F_j$ Now I fear there is an error probably in the second point (because my note aren't like this) but I can't find which assumption is wrong, can you help me?","['general-topology', 'proof-verification', 'galois-theory']"
1737716,Simple application of Donsker's theorem,"I am trying to do exercise 5.15 in Moerter's book ""Brownian Motion"". It seems quite easy, but I can't solve it somehow: Suppose $S(j)_j$ is a SRW on the integers, started at zero. Show that:
$$
\frac{1}{n^2}\min_j\{|S(j)|=n\}\to^d\min_t\{|B(t)|=1\}\, .

$$
P(\min_t\{|B(t)|=1\}\le s)=P(M_s\ge 1)=P(B\in K_s)\, \

where $M$ is the max of the modulus of a Brownian motion and and $K_s$ is the set of continuous functions whos maximum is bigger than one. But:
$$
P(S^*(t)\in K_s)=?

1737737,Is there a way to write this recurrence relation in faster-to-program manner?,"I have the following recurrence relation for some coefficients $$b_{n+2} = \frac{1}{(n+3)(n+2)P_0} \sum_{k=1}^n (n-k+2) (n-k+1) b_k b_{n-k+2}, \quad n>1$$ with $b_1$ to $b_3$ and $P_0$ being the  initial conditions of the series.

The best cases scenario would be to have $b_n = F(n)$, which of course would be simpler to read and way faster to program, but I'm not sure this is possible.

My brief efforts involved induction on $n$ which failed since I ended up with having to manipulate $\sin( n+1)\theta=\sin( n\theta +\theta)=\sin n\theta \cos\theta+\cos n\theta\sin\theta $, which involves $\cos n\theta$. I tried the ""familiar"" method of expansion of $$\sin n\theta=n\theta-\frac{(n\theta)^3}{3!}+\frac{(n\theta)^5}{5!}-+\cdots$$
but this only made it more complicated$$\sin n\theta=n\theta-\frac{(n\theta)^3}{3!}+\frac{(n\theta)^5}{5!}-+\cdots=\\n\Big(\theta-\frac{\theta^3}{3!}+\frac{\theta^5}{5!}-+\cdots\Big)-\frac{n(n^2-1)}{3!}\Big(\theta-\frac{\theta^3}{3!}+\frac{\theta^5}{5!}-+\cdots\Big)^3+-\cdots$$
Another attempt would be to use the identity $$\sin n\theta=\frac{1}{2i}(e^{in\theta}-e^{-in\theta})$$
though this was obviously not known to Newton. In any case, any thougths, ideas are welcome.. EDIT A thorough answer has been provided below, but since it  involves the use of complex numbers, I deem that the search for another answer, one based solely on the mathematical knowledge up to Newton's time is open. After a bit more research, it appears that Newton came up with the formula after reading a book by Vieta, but I have been unable to gather further info on whether the formula was known to Vieta as well.","['real-analysis', 'reference-request', 'trigonometry', 'calculus', 'sequences-and-series']"

Let $X_1: \Omega \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, $X_2: \Omega \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be two random variables over $\Omega$ (i.e., we're in the context of a Bernouli trial with, say, a coin flip). In fact, we can let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be $id$ in this context. We can suppose further that they are $i.i.d.$ Question: When people write $X_1 + X_2$, what do they mean? In particular, what is the domain and range of $X_1 + X_2$? I'm assuming that its probability distribution forms a convolution of $X_1$ and $X_2$. As I see it, the options for the domain and range are as follows: $X_1 +X_2$ is a function from $\Omega = \{0, 1\}$ to $\{0, 2\}$ s.t. $(X_1 + X_2)(0) = 0 + 0 = 0$ and $X_1 \rightarrow X_2(1) = 1 + 1 = 0$. $X_1 + X_2$ is a function from $\{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\}$ to $\{0, 1, 2\}$ s.t. $(X_1 + X_2)(i,k) = i + k$.

1738685,When does a partially defined map from a singular curve to projective space extend?,"This is just something train of thought I became curious about after reading a cryptic suggestion that resolution of singularities lets us transfer our ""understanding"" of smooth curves to singular curves. (Do we understand smooth curves? What is does the author - Ravi Vakil - mean? Anyway, onto the precise math question ...) Suppose that $C$ is a singular, integral affine curve, over some algebraically closed field $k$. Let $f : C \to X$ be some rational map to a projective $k$-scheme (or just $\mathbb{P}^n_k$). Let $C'$ be the normalization of $C$, and $\pi: C' \to C$ the normalizing map. Then the map $f \circ \pi$ extends to a regular map $j: C' \to X$, since $C'$ is regular. I want to know when the map $f : C \to X$ will extend. There are two natural obstructions to the map $f$ extending to a map defined on all of $C'$, which come from the necessity that $j = f \circ \pi$ if $f$ extended. Namely, for points $p,q \in C'$ which have $\pi(p) = \pi(q)$, $j(p) = j(q)$ is necessary. Also, for a point $p \in C'$, and a tangent vector $v \in T_p C'$, if $d\pi(v) = 0$, then necessarily $dj(v) = 0$. I want to know - are these the only conditions? (They come from looking at the normalization of the nodal cubic and the cuspidal cubic respectively. So maybe my intuition about normalizations is missing some crucial example?) If $j$ satisfies the above conditions, then was it a lift of some extension of $f$ from $C$ to $X$? If not, what are the correct conditions?

Now choose $X = x$ and let $Y$ be uniformly distributed over $[0,x]$. Is it possible for us to calculate the ""expected value of $X$ given $Y = y$"", i.e. , $\mathbb{E}(X|Y = y)$? Intuitively, it seems that if $y = 0$, we gain no information, and so $\mathbb{E}(X|Y = 0) = \mathbb{E}(X) = \dfrac{1}{2}$, and also that if $y = 1$, it must be the case that $x = 1$, so $\mathbb{E}(X|Y = 1) = 1$. I don't know if this reasoning is correct, but if it is, then it seems to suggest that $\mathbb{E}(X|Y = y)$ should be a monotonic function of $y$ over $[0,1]$, increasing from $\dfrac{1}{2}$ to $1$. I can also try to do some calculations with probability densities. From the statement of the problem, we have $f_X = 1$ and $f_{Y|X} = \dfrac{1}{x}$. Now, the joint distribution is $f_{XY} = f_X f_{Y|X} = \dfrac{1}{x}$, and as a sanity check we can verify that indeed $\displaystyle\int_0^1 \int_0^x \dfrac{1}{x} \,\mathrm{d}y \,\mathrm{d}x = 1$. Now it seems to me that $\displaystyle f_Y = \int_y^1 f_{XY} \,\mathrm{d}y = -\ln(y)$, and so we can do the following calculation: $$f_{X|Y} = \frac{f_{Y|X} f_X}{f_Y} = -\frac{1}{x \ln y}.$$ Now, I thought that I would be able to perform the following calculation to arrive at my result: $$\mathbb{E}(X|Y = y) = \int_y^1 -\frac{1}{x \ln y} \cdot x \,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{y-1}{\ln y}.$$ Is this right?

1738870,Differentiability of an action of the group of invertible elements of a $C^{*}$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ on the dual of $\mathcal{A}$,"I am studying the actions of Banach-Lie groups on Banach manifolds, and I am not able to concretely evaluate the differentiability properties of a specific action. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a unital $C^{*}$-algebra, and $\mathcal{A}^{*}$ its topological dual, which is a complex Banach space with norm: $$
\left|\left|\omega\right|\right|:=\sup\left\{|\omega(\mathbf{A})|\,;\mathbf{A}\in\mathcal{A}\colon||\mathbf{A}||=1\right\}
$$
Let us denote with $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{A})$ the set of all invertible elements in $\mathcal{A}$.
This set is a Banach-Lie group with respect to the multiplication operation inherited from $\mathcal{A}$.
This group naturally acts on $\mathcal{A}$ as follows: $$
\mathbf{A}\mapsto c_{\mathbf{G}}(\mathbf{A}):=\mathbf{G}\,\mathbf{A}\,\mathbf{G}^{\dagger}\,.
$$
By means of this action, an action on $\mathcal{A}^{*}$ is obtained: $$
\omega\mapsto \alpha_{\mathbf{G}}(\omega)
$$
$$
\left(\alpha_{\mathbf{G}}(\omega)\right)(\mathbf{A}):=\omega\left(c_{\mathbf{G}}(\mathbf{A})\right)=\omega\left(\mathbf{G}\,\mathbf{A}\,\mathbf{G}^{\dagger}\right)\,.
$$
It is easy to see that this action is linear and preserves hermiticity. I am interested in the differentiability properties of this action.
By definition, the action is differentiable if the map: $$
\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{A})\times\mathcal{A}^{*}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}^{*}
$$ 
$$
(\mathbf{G}\,;\omega)\mapsto \alpha_{G}\omega
$$
is differentiable.
I know the abstract definition of differentiability (Frechet derivative) of a map between Banach manifolds, however, I do not know how to concretely proceed to investigate the subject.
Specifically, a map $f:V\rightarrow W$ between Banach space is differentiable at $x_{0}\in V$ if, for all $\epsilon>0$ there exist $\delta_{\epsilon}>0$ and a bounded linear map $Df_{x_{0}}:V\rightarrow W$ such that: $$
||f(x-x_{0}) - f(x_{0}) - Df_{x_{0}}(x-x_{0})||<\epsilon
$$
whenever $||x-x_{0}||<\delta_{\epsilon}$. Since $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{A})$ is only a Banach manifold, I need a coordinates system in order to use the definition of Frechet derivative, and I do not know what kind of coordinates system I should use.
Furthermore, even if I knew it, I would need an ""educated guess"" of the explicit face of the derivative $Df_{x_{0}}$ to actually calculate the limit in the definition of the Frechet derivative. Are there other, more smart ways to proceed? Thank You in advance. EDIT With a little effort, I was able to prove that the linear map $\alpha_{\mathbf{G}}:\mathcal{A}^{*}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}^{*}$ is bounded, and thus continuous, for all $\mathbf{G}\in\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{A})$.
This means that $\alpha_{\mathbf{G}}$ is analytic for all $\mathbf{G}$ (it is a continuous 1-homogeneous polynomial), but I do not know if it is of some relevance. EDIT 2 According to Andreas Cap's answer, I tried to work out the details without using the $t$ parameter. Let $U_{\mathbf{G}}\subset\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{A})$ be a neighbourhood of $\mathbf{G}$ such that $\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{H}\in U$ for all $\mathbf{H}\in U$.
Then we can write: $$
\alpha(\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{H}\,;\omega + \tau)(\mathbf{A}) - \alpha(\mathbf{G}\,;\omega)(\mathbf{A})=\omega(\mathbf{G}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{H}^{\dagger} + \mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{G}^{\dagger}) + \omega(\mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{H}^{\dagger}) + \tau(\mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{H}^{\dagger}) + \tau(\mathbf{G}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{G}^{\dagger})
$$
The linear functional introduced by Andreas Cap is: $$
D\alpha_{\mathbf{G}\,;\omega}(\mathbf{H}\,;\tau)(\mathbf{A})=\omega(\mathbf{G}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{H}^{\dagger} + \mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{G}^{\dagger}) + \tau(\mathbf{G}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{G}^{\dagger})
$$
and thus: $$
\alpha(\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{H}\,;\omega + \tau)(\mathbf{A}) - \alpha(\mathbf{G}\,;\omega)(\mathbf{A}) - D\alpha_{\mathbf{G}\,;\omega}(\mathbf{H}\,;\tau)(\mathbf{A})= \tau(\mathbf{G}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{H}^{\dagger} + \mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{G}^{\dagger})+ (\omega+\tau)(\mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{H}^{\dagger})
$$
Let us call this functional $\gamma$.
The norm of $\gamma$ is: $$
||\gamma||=\sup_{\mathbf{A}\neq\mathbf{0}}\frac{|\gamma(\mathbf{A})|}{||\mathbf{A}||}
$$
Then: $$
|\gamma(\mathbf{A})|\leq|\tau(\mathbf{G}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{H}^{\dagger} + \mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{G}^{\dagger})| + |(\omega+\tau)(\mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{H}^{\dagger})|\leq
$$
$$
\leq2||\tau||\,||\mathbf{G}||\,||\mathbf{A}||\,||\mathbf{H}|| + ||\omega||\,||\mathbf{H}||^{2}\,||\mathbf{A}|| + ||\tau||\,||\mathbf{H}||^{2} \,||\mathbf{A}||
$$
which means: $$
||\gamma||=2||\tau||\,||\mathbf{G}||\,||\mathbf{H}|| + ||\omega||\,||\mathbf{H}||^{2} + ||\tau||\,||\mathbf{H}||^{2}
$$
The action $\alpha$ is differentiable at $(\mathbf{G}\,;\omega)$ if, for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists $\delta_{\epsilon}>0$ such that: $$
\frac{||\gamma||}{||(\mathbf{H}\,;\tau)||}<\epsilon
$$
whenever $||(\mathbf{H}\,;\tau)||<\delta_{\epsilon}$.
However, we have: $$
\frac{||\gamma||}{||(\mathbf{H}\,;\tau)||}=\frac{2||\tau||\,||\mathbf{G}||\,||\mathbf{H}|| + ||\omega||\,||\mathbf{H}||^{2} + ||\tau||\,||\mathbf{H}||^{2}}{||\mathbf{H}|| +||\tau||}
$$
and I am not sure that this is less than $\epsilon$.","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'differential-geometry', 'lie-groups']"

(The reason is that $\| \cdot\|$ is invariant under orthogonal multiplication, in particular by signed permutation matrices). Question: Is it true that any norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is invariant under signed permutations induces an orhtogonal-invariant norm on $M_n$? (in the obvious way as described above). If not, can we characterize which norms are possible? Added Clarification: Let $f$ be a norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$. The possible candidate for a norm on $M_n$ induced by $f$ is: $\| X\|=\|U\Sigma V^T \|=f(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n)$ where $\Sigma=\operatorname{diag}(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n) $. The non trivial part seems to be verifying the triangle inequality, since SVD does not behave in a structured way (known to me) w.r.t sums. Remarks and partial results: 1) Choosing $f$ to be the maximumn norm induces the Euclidean operator norm. (see here ). 2) Choosing $f$ to be the standard $p$-norm, one gets the $p-$ Schatten norm . 3) Here is a sufficient condition (which is not necessary) inducing a norm:
 $$\sum_{i=1}^n z_i \le \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \Rightarrow f(z_1,\dots,z_n) \le f(x_1,\dots,x_n) + f(y_1,\dots,y_n)$$ Any $f$ which satisfies the above condition induces a norm. This follows from Lidskii inequality which says: $$\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i(A+B) \le \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i(A) + \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i(B) $$ Note this condition is not necessary: The maximum norm does not satisfy it, but induces a norm.","['matrices', 'normed-spaces', 'symmetry', 'linear-algebra']"

Motivation: $$\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x}}}=2\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x}}-\ln (1+2\sqrt{x}+2\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x}})+C$$ This integral is easy to solve by using the following substitution: $$x=u^4$$ $$\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x}}=u\sqrt{1+u^2}$$ Now consider the integral $(*)$. If we take $x=u^8$, we get the integral: $$(*)=\int \frac{8u^6du}{\sqrt{u^6+\sqrt{1+u^4}}}$$ Still seems bad, and Mathematica can't solve it (or the definite integral either). Another way I tried is by the following substitutions: $$\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x}}=\frac{y}{2}$$ $$(*)=\int \frac{y(\sqrt{1+y^2}-1)dy}{\sqrt{1+y^2} \sqrt{2+2y+y^2-2\sqrt{1+y^2}}}$$ $$y=\sinh t$$ $$(*)=\int \frac{\sinh t(\cosh t-1)dt}{\sqrt{(\cosh t-1)^2+2\sinh t}}$$ Believe it or not, Mathematica actually solves this integral, but the resulting expression is so long and complicated, it seems useless (and by long I mean three times the size of my screen).
