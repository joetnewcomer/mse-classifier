603277,Integer parts of multiples of irrationals,"Let $\alpha>0$ and define 
$$S(\alpha)=\big\{\lfloor n \alpha \rfloor: n\in\Bbb Z^+ \big\}.$$ Here $\lfloor x\rfloor$ is the integer part of $x$ and $\mathbb Z^+$ the set of positive integers. Question. Is it possible to find $\alpha,\beta,\gamma>0$, such that $$
S(\alpha)\cap S(\beta)= S(\beta) \cap S(\gamma) =S(\alpha)\cap S(\gamma) = \varnothing\text{?}
$$ It is well-known that the following holds
$$
S(\alpha)\cap S(\beta)=\varnothing\quad\,\text{and}\,\quad S(\alpha)\cup S(\beta)=\mathbb Z^+
$$
if and only if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are irrational (and positive) and $\,\,\dfrac{1}{\alpha}+\dfrac{1}{\beta}=1$. Update 1. According to a 1995 Putnam examination question, there are no $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ for which $S(\alpha)$, $S(\beta)$ and $S(\gamma)$ form a partition of $\mathbb Z^+$. Update 2. The following result holds: $S(\alpha)\cap S(\beta)=\varnothing$ if and only $\alpha,\beta$ are irrational and if there exist positive integers $m,n$, such that $$
\frac{m}{\alpha}+\frac{n}{\beta}=1.

603341,Recurrence relation for number of bit strings of length n that contain two consecutive 1s,"I'm pulling my hair out over a review question for my final tomorrow. Find a recurrence relation (and its initial conditions) for the number of bit strings of length n that contain two consecutive 1s. Here is my thought process/work, could someone please help me figure out where I'm going wrong? Knowing that a bit string of length 0 or 1 cannot contain two consecutive bits of any kind, and that only one bit string of length 2 (the string 11) can contain two consecutive ones, I have the initial conditions a(0) = 0 , a(1) = 0 , and a(2) = 1 . I'm now trying to find a formula for the term a(n+2) . I know there are three ways for a bit string of length n + 2 to have two consecutive 1s: Condition X : Both n + 1 and n + 2 are 1. count(X) = 2^n because this still leaves n bits unaccounted for. Condition Y : Both n and n + 1 are 1. count(Y) = 2^n for the same reason. Condition Z : The first n bits contain 11 somewhere. count(Z) = 4 * a(n) because adding 2 bits to the a(n) condition quadruples the number of possible strings. Since these three conditions are not mutually exclusive, a(n+2) count(X) + count(Y) + count(Z) - (count(X $\cup$ Y) + count(X $\cap$ Z) + count(Y $\cap$ Z)) + count($X \cap Y \cap Z)$ or a(n+2) = 2^n + 2^n + 4 * a(n) - (2^(n-1) + a(n) + 2 * a(n-1)) + a(n-1) This successfully proves the initial condition a(2) = 1 and the next one - a(3) = 3 . But when I plug in 4, I get 9. Listing out the possible strings by hand and circling the ones that satisfy the condition gives only 8. What am I doing wrong?

603362,A (possible) error in Ahlfors' text (analytic continuation along arcs),"In Ahlfors' complex analysis text, page 289 he discusses analytic continuation along arcs. I will start with some background Let $\mathbf{f}$ be a global analytic function, with corresponding Riemann surface $\mathfrak{S_0} (\mathbf{f})$ (which is a connected a component of the sheaf $\mathfrak{S}$ of germs of analytic functions in the complex plane). Ahlfors defines an analytic continuation, along an arc $\gamma:[a,b] \to \mathbb C$ to be a continuous function $\overline{\gamma}:[a,b] \to \mathfrak{S_0}(\mathbf{f})$, such that $\pi \circ \bar{\gamma}=\gamma$, where $\pi$ is the standard projection map. Later in the same page, he investigates the case where analytic continuation is impossible along an arc $\gamma:[a,b] \to \mathbb{C}$, starting at the initial germ $\mathbf{f}_{\zeta(a)}$ (I think that's a typo, and should read $\mathbf{f}_{\gamma(a)}$ instead). He notes that analytic continuation is possible if we restrict ourselves to subarcs $\gamma \big|_{[a,t_0]}$ for small enough $t_0$. Next, he considers the supremum of the set (which I'll call $E$) of all such numbers $t_0$, and denotes it $\tau$. The following claims are made about $\tau$, which I'm having trouble agreeing with : $a<\tau<b$ continuation will be possible for $t_0 < \tau$, impossible for $t_0 \geq \tau$. Regarding the first claim, I agree that $a<\tau$, since $E$ contains numbers greater than $a$ - however, I can't see why $\tau$ is strictly lesser than $b$. Regarding the second claim, I agree that analytic continuation is possible for $t_0<\tau$ since these are members of $E$. I agree also that analytic continuation is impossible for $t_0>\tau$, by the properties of the supremum - however, why is analytic continuation never  possible for the point $t_0=\tau$ itself?

603394,Product in the category of varieties,"I am tasked to show that given affine varieties $X$ and $Y$, that $A(X\times Y)\cong A(X)\otimes A(y)$. I think I am very close I just need a little nudge. Proof so far Define the map $\ell:A(X)\times A(Y)\rightarrow A(X)\otimes A(Y)$ by $(f,g)\mapsto f\otimes g$. Also define $\phi:A(X)\times A(Y)\rightarrow A(X\times Y)$ by $(f,g)\mapsto fg$. $\phi$ is clearly a bilinear map. Therefore by universal property there exists a homomorphism $\psi:A(X)\otimes A(Y)\rightarrow A(X\times Y)$, such that $\phi=\psi\circ \ell$. From this I've shown that $\psi$ is onto. I need to show that it is injective. I am looking for a map $\Gamma:A[X\times Y]\rightarrow A(X)\otimes A(Y)$ such that $\Gamma\circ\psi=id$. This would show an injection but.

603647,A random non-poisson process,"I encountered this example in a book : Buses
  arrive at a station deterministically, on the hour, and fifteen minutes after the hour.
  Thus, the interarrival times alternate between $15$ and $45$ minutes. The average
  interarrival time is $30$ minutes. A person shows up at the bus station at a ârandomâ
  time. We interpret ârandomâ to mean a time which is uniformly distributed within
  a particular hour. Such a person falls into an interarrival interval of length $15$ with
  probability $1/4$, and an interarrival interval of length $45$ with probability $3/4$. The
  expected value of the length of the chosen interarrival interval is
  $$15\cdot\frac{1}{4}+45\cdot\frac{3}{4} = 37.5$$
  which is considerably larger than $30$, the average interarrival time. This was given in the book after explaining the random-incidence paradox . I understand that this example has been given to show that it is counter-intuitive to think that the inter-arrival times and time which a person has to wait on average between two arrival is same. With reference to the above example in the book , I have a very simple doubt , shouldn't we in the calculation use $7.5$ and $22.5$ instead of $15$ and $45$ , because although the probability of falling in $15$ minute interval is $\frac{1}{4}$ , but once it falls in the $15$ minute interval , on an average the person has to wait $7.5$ minutes ( because the process is uniformly random ) .

603658,Graph isomorphism and existence of nontrivial automorphisms,"Consider the following two algorithmic problems - one of determining whether two graphs are isomorphic and the other of determining if a graph has a nontrivial automorphism: (1) Decision problem: Graph isomorphism.
Instance: Graphs $G$ and $H$.
Question: Is $G \cong H$? (2) Decision problem: Nontrivial automorphism group.
Instance: A graph $G$.
Question: Is $Aut(G)>1$. An article I'm reading ([P. J. Cameron, ""Automorphisms of graphs,'' Chapter 5, Topics in Algebraic Graph Theory]) says that if we can solve (1), then we can solve (2) ""by attaching distinctive `gadgets' at each vertex and checking whether any pair of the resulting graphs are isomorphic.'' For example, if $G$ is the 4-cycle graph on vertices $a,b,c,d$, then, we can attach the cycle graphs $C_5, C_6, C_7, C_8$ to $a,b,c,d$, respectively, to get a graph $G'$.  We can attach $C_7, C_6, C_5, C_8$, to $a,b,c,d$, respectively, to get a graph $G''$. If $G' \cong G''$, then $(a,c)$ is an automorphism of $G$. It seems to me that to solve (2) the number of pairs to check for isomorphism is superexponential and on the order of $n!$ at first thought, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$.  Is it true that (2) does not have the same complexity as (1), at least given just this proof of attaching gadgets?","['discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms', 'graph-theory', 'combinatorics', 'algebraic-graph-theory']"

603713,Commutator Subgroup and the Largest Abelian Quotient,"Good day. I'm not too sure how I should go about asking my question, so if it is in anyway confusing, feel free to edit it. In my Group Theory course we defined and showed a few properties of the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ of a group $G$. And then we stated and proved a lemma in lecture that I'm having some difficulty wrapping my head around. I'll state it here for clarity. Lemma a) The commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ of $G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. b) The quotient group $G / [G,G]$ is the largest abelian quotient of G in the sense that every homomorphism $\varphi : G \to A$ where $A$ is an an abelian group, induces a unique homomorphism $\bar \varphi : G/[G,G] \to A$ so that $\varphi =\bar \varphi \circ \pi$ where $\pi : G \to G/[G,G]$ is the quotient homomorphism. Now, it's not the proof of this lemma that I'm having trouble with, it's the italicized text that is messing with me. I completely understand what it is that the italicized text is saying, I'm just not too sure why it is that the property gives us the ""largeness"" that is claimed. I can see that the above forces $G$ to ""pass through"" $G/[G,G]$ before it ""reaches"" $A$ (I apologize for the casual terminology), so I can sort of see why $G/[G,G]$ should be the largest quotient, in a non-rigorous sort of way. Overall I'm very confused. Perhaps I'm missing something very simple. Any help or nudges in the right direction would be much appreciated. As a side note I did try a search on Google and here on Stack Exchange and couldn't find anything that answered my question. So if I missed something obvious, then my apologies.

Prove that $H_p$ is a subgroup of $G$, and that $G/H_p$ has no elements whose order is a non-zero power of $p$. So, to prove that $H_p$ is a subgroup of $G$, I need to show (among others) that it is closed under the group operation. Let $a$, $b \in H_p$, by hypothesis $\mathrm{ord}(a) = p^m, \mathrm{ord}(b) = p^n$ for some integers $m, n$. Now  consider $(ab)^{p^{mn}}$: since $G$ is abelian, this is equal to $a^{p^{mn}}b^{p^{mn}}$, which is in turn equal to $a^{{(p^m)}^n}b^{{(p^n)}^m}$, which is equal to the identity $e$, since $p^m = \mathrm{ord}(a)$ and $p^n = \mathrm{ord}(b)$. In other words, $(ab)^{p^{mn}} = e$, hence $\mathrm{ord}(ab)$ divides $p^{mn}$. Now here is where I am puzzled: nothing is assumed about $p$. For if $p$ were assumed to be prime (as the choice of the letter ""p"" seems to indicate), it would indeed seem to follow that $\mathrm{ord}(ab)$ must itself be a power of $p$. Conversely, there seem to be counterexamples when $p$ is not prime, e.g. if we take $G = (\mathbb{Z}_{12},+)$ and set $p = 4$, then $H_4$ contains $3$ ($\mathrm{ord}(3) = 4$), but $3 + 3 = 6$ has order $2$, which is not a power of $4$.

  Is this function surjective? first idea: If $u$ would be allowed to be delta function, than for given $v\in U$ I would take finite number of times $t_1,\dots,t_n$ and define $u$ as $u(t) = \sum_i \delta_{t_i}(t) u_i$, that $v = \sum_i A(t_i) u_i$. Since I'm not allowed to take delta function, I took only approximations of them. Than I can do only $f(u) =  v \pm \epsilon$. Next I find $u_1$ that $f(u_1) = v-f(u) \pm \epsilon_1$. And I can continue like this. So I get $f(u)+f(u_1)+\dots + f(u_n) = v \pm \epsilon_n$. The problem is that I cant show that $u + \sum_n u_n$ converge. second idea: Approximate $A(t)$ by sequence of simple functions $A_n(t)$ that still $U =\text{span}\left( \bigcup_{t\in [0,T]} \text{span}(A_n(t)) \right)$.

If we relax the requirement that the pentagon lie in a plane, we can easily find a closed path of 5 equal length sides: for example, in $\mathbb{R}^5$ with the integer lattice, we can use the path $$(1,0,0,0,0)\to(0,1,0,0,0)\to(0,0,1,0,0)\to(0,0,0,1,0)\to(0,0,0,0,1).$$ (These are the vertices of the standard 4-simplex.)

Exponentiation can also be thought of as repeated multiplication of natural numbers such that $a^2 = a\times a$ $a^3 = a\times a\times a$ $\cdots$ $a^n = \underbrace{a \times a \times \cdots \times a}_\text{n times}$ where $a, n \in N$. More formally, we have the following requirements of exponentiation (as repeated multiplication on $N$): $\forall x\in N: x^2 = x\cdot x$ $\forall x,y\in N: x^{y+1}=x^y\cdot x$ It can be formally proven (see link) that there are infinitely many binary functions on $N$ that satisfy these two requirements. Fortunately, they differ only in the value assigned to $0^0$, which can be any natural number whatsoever. For each of these functions, $x^0=1$ for $x\neq 0$.

From (1) and (2), we can also derive the usual Laws of Exponents provided we avoid any explicit reference to a value for $0^0$. From (1) and (2), we can, for example, derive: $\forall x,y,z\in N: [x\neq 0 \implies x^y\cdot x^z = x^{y+z}]$ (For a formal development of these ideas, see ""Oh, the Ambiguity!"" at my math blog .) My question: While there may be similarities, how is the leap made from repeated Cartesian products to repeated multiplication on the natural numbers (in order to justify $0^0=1$)? Or are they two fundamentally different things? Added: Are (1) and (2) above insufficient as requirements for repeated multiplication on $N$? If so, what other requirements might reasonably be added to enable us to derive $0^0=1$ (or any other particular value)? Note: This question is a follow-up to my answer at Why is $ A^0 = \{ \emptyset \}$?","['elementary-number-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"

Let $M_{n}=\max_{1\leq i \leq n}X_{i}$. Show that $n(1-M_{n})$ converges weakly to an exponential distribution with parameter $1$. I attempted to solve this problem using characteristic functions and Levy's Continuity Theorem. Perhaps the issue is what the characteristic function of $n(1-M_{n})$ is supposed to look like, because I was unable to get the expectation of that characteristic function to converge to $\frac{1}{1-iu}$, the characteristic function of an exponential with parameter $1$. Anyway, this is what I did: \begin{align}
\varphi_{n(1-M_{n})}&=E\{exp(iun(1-M_{n}))\}=\exp(iun)E\{\exp(-iunM_{n})\}\\
&=\exp(iun)\cdot\frac{1}{1-0}\int_{0}^{1}\exp(-iunM_{n})dM\\
& =-\frac{1}{iun}[\exp(-iunM_{n})]_{0}^{1}\\
&=-\frac{1}{iun}[\exp(-iun)-1]=\frac{\exp(iun)+1}{iun},

604399,An alternative approach to constructing the free group.,"Let $A$ be a set. We wish to construct the free group $F(A)$ . It seems that this (invariably?) starts out like this: Let $A'$ be a copy of $A$ , and let $\mathscr A=A\cup A'$ . Let $\mathscr L$ be the set of finite strings of elements of $\mathscr A$ . Then it seems the usual approach does this: Show that each element of $\mathscr L$ can be reduced to a unique irreducible form. Show that concatenation followed by reduction is a group operation on the set of irreducible forms, forming a group $F(A)$ . Prove that this satisfies the universal property of a free group. Possible alternative? Having defined $\mathscr L$ , define an equivalence relation $\sim$ by letting $s\sim t$ iff there is some finite sequence of reductions and/or expansions that transform $s$ into $t$ . Let $F(A)=\mathscr L/\sim$ . This appears to make it really easy to prove that $F(A)$ is a group, and I believe it is still easy to see it is the free group, but I don't have a clue how to prove that each element has a unique irreducible representative, which would, I believe, make this a nice clean drop-in replacement for what appears to be the standard approach.

which is the partial derivative of the beta function at $(x=0,y=1)$: $$I=\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+}\partial_y^2\partial_x B(x,1)$$
