447547,Proving that the map from a topological space to a fiber bundle is open.,"There are two pieces to a question, the first: Let G be a group acting on a space $E$. Show that the quotient map $E \rightarrow E/G$ is open. The second: Let p : E â†’ X be a fiber bundle. Show that p is an open map. My thoughts are the following.  First we see what a ""fiber"" is: If for E and X as topological spaces we let $p:E \rightarrow X$ be a mapping, $U \subseteq X$ and $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$, then $p^{-1}(x) \in E$ where $p$ is called the fiber over $x$. The fiber bundle is one such that: $\forall y \in E \space\space \exists U \subset X \text{ where }\phi_{U}:p^{-1}(U) \text{ is homeomorphic to the product space } F \times U \text{ where } F \text{ is the fiber bundle }$ Now I address the second piece first as I have a better idea of why this would be true, however could use some clarification.  On this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle It says: ""Every fiber bundle is an open map, since projections of products are open maps.""  While I don't see why the projections of products are open maps (unless they are just referring to topological spaces as top. spaces are both open and closed), I am wondering if p is an open map as by the definition of a fiber bundle we have that since the product space $F \times U$ is open as $U$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ then since the pre-image $p^{-1}(x) \in E$ is homeomorphic to $F \times U$ then $p$ has to be an open map. As for the first part, since $E$ is a Topological space and hence it is open, then if I mod out some closed set it would still be open.  Is there more to it than this?

447552,The extinction probability of Galton-Watson process from a martingale perspective.,"Let $Z_0,Z_1,\ldots$ be a Galton-Watson process with $Z_0=1$. Let $\mu = \mathbb E(Z_1)$. Let $\phi(s) = \mathbb E (s^{Z_1})$ be the generating function. When $\mu > 1$, there is an unique solution $\rho$ for $\phi(\rho) = \rho$ on $[0,1)$. And we have $\mathbb P\{Z_n = 0 \text{ for some } n\} = \rho$. It is also known that $Z_n/\mu^n$ is a non-negative martingale, which converges almost surely to a random variable $W$ with $\mathbb E(W)<\infty$. The above can be find in many probability textbooks. What I'm trying to solve is the following exercise Show that if $\mathbb P (\lim Z_n/\mu^n = 0) < 1$ then it is $= \rho$ and hence
  $\{\lim Z_n /\mu^n > 0\} = \{Z_n > 0 \text { for all $n$} \}$ a.s. Let $A = \{ \lim Z_n/\mu^n = 0\}$. Let $B = \{Z_n = 0 \text { for some $n$}\}$. We are asked to show then given $\mathbb P(A) <1$, we have $\mathbb P(A) = \mathbb P(B)$. My idea is that since $B \subseteq A$, it suffices to show that $\mathbb P(A \setminus B)=0$, i.e.,
$$
\mathbb P(\lim Z_n/\mu^n = 0, Z_n > 0 \text { for all $n$}) = 0.
$$
I also know that with probability $1$, $Z_n \to 0$ or $Z_n \to \infty$. So the above equation is the same as
$$
\mathbb P(\lim Z_n/\mu^n = 0, Z_n \to \infty) = 0.
$$
I'm stuck here, because although in this set, $Z_n \to \infty$, it still could be $o(\mu^n)$. How can I show this can not happen?","['probability-theory', 'martingales']"

447568,An article from AMM vol 95 Page 942. (I have some doubt about it),"Today I am reading an article in American Math Monthly volume 95 Page 942. Author introduces an alternating series:$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n\frac{(2n)!}{4^n(n!)^2}$$
then he uses the Stirling's formula and alternating series test to conclude that the above series is conditional convergent. Using Stirling's formula, we have $$\frac{(2n)!}{4^n(n!)^2} \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$$ and I think this facts implies that $\frac{(2n)!}{4^n(n!)^2} \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. But the author says that it is a little more difficult to obtain $\frac{(2n)!}{4^n(n!)^2} \rightarrow 0$ and he introduces Sapagof's Test : Theorem Suppose$\{a_n\}$ is a decreasing sequence of positive numbers and for each natural number $n$, define $b_n = 1-a_{n+1}/a_n$. Then the sequence$\{a_n\}$converges to zero if and only if the series $\sum b_n$ diverges. He uses the above theorem to conclude that $a_n \rightarrow 0$. What's wrong with me?

I have verified the absence of solutions for $n<10^{85}$ so their absence seems certain. Can this be proved? (Has it been?) I would also be interested in information on the general problem.

447609,The correct probability distribution / way to analyze daily changes,"I am working on a report which is being sent through to end users that should flag to them any ""large changes"" in the day-to-day values for the past 30 days for something we would assume the day-to-day differences to have a mean of zero. So, assume we have the following data: Day:    Change from previous day:
1       -40
2       30
3       15
4       12
5       -34
6       -2
...
30      12 And they don't care about the direction of the change, just to flag any day where the change is of a ""statistically significant"" magnitude. I'm curious as to how to calculate the statistics for this properly / what distribution would best be used to assign probability levels for this set of data. What has been proposed is to, firstly, look at the square of the changes (rather than the original values since all we care about is magnitude): To calculate the std dev as $\sqrt{ \dfrac{\sum \left( x_i - 0 \right)^2 }{29}}$ - In other words assume a zero expected value To Calculate the std dev as $\sqrt{ \dfrac{\sum \left( x_i - \bar{x} \right)^2 }{29}}$ - In other words, use the mean we would calculate for this sample And then to take each day's value and divide it by this std_dev to calculate it's magnitude. I have quite a few problems with a few things here, but especially idea #2 since I believe the mean SHOULD BE ZERO. Generally speaking, what is the correct way to analyze deltas with an expected value of zero and what distribution would you use for a 30-sample data-set to find statistically significant values? I hope this makes sense, but, if not, please let me know where I could clarify more. THANKS!!!","['statistics', 'data-analysis', 'probability', 'random-variables']"

447637,Calculating derivative by definition vs not by definition,"I'm not entirely sure I understand when I need to calculate a derivative using the definition and when I can do it normally. 
The following two examples confused me: $$ g(x) = \begin{cases} x^2\cdot \sin(\frac {1}{x}) & x \neq 0 \\ 0 & x=0 \end{cases} $$ $$ f(x) = \begin{cases} e^{\frac {-1}{x}} & x > 0 \\ -x^2 & x\leq 0 \end{cases} $$ I understand that I can differentiate normally for any $x$ that's not 0 (in both of these examples). 
I'm confused because I saw an example with $f(x)$ in which they calculated the $f'(x)$ by differentiating: $$ f'(x) = \begin{cases} \frac {1}{x^2}\cdot e^{\frac {-1}{x}}  & x > 0 \\ -2x & x\leq0 \end{cases} $$ and then they calculated $f'(0)$ not using the definition but by $ \lim_{x\to0^-} f'(x)$ $\lim_{x\to0^+} f'(x)$ For $g(x)$ though I know that $g'(0)$ exists (using definition)  but $$g'(x) = \begin{cases} 2x\cdot \sin(\frac {1}{x})-\cos(\frac {1}{x})   & x \ne 0 \\ 0 & x=0 \end{cases}$$ and you can't calculate $\lim_{x\to0^-} g'(x)$ or $\lim_{x\to0^+} g'(x)$ since $\lim_{x\to0^{+/-}} 2x\cdot \sin(\frac {1}{x})-\cos(\frac {1}{x}) $  doesn't exist. So what's the difference between these two? When can I just differentiate normally like in the first example ($f(x)$) and when do I have to use the definition like in the second example ($g(x)$)? I'd appreciate the help.

447646,Can one calculate a blowup Ã©tale locally?,"In what follows, I assume all schemes are Noetherian and of finite type. It follows from the universal property that one can calculate the blowup of a coherent ideal sheaf $\mathscr{I}$ on a scheme $X$ Zariski locally. That is, taking a Zariski neighborhood $i : U \hookrightarrow X$, we have $\text{Bl}_U(i^{-1}\mathscr{I})$ is (isomorphic to) an open subscheme of $\text{Bl}_X(\mathscr{I})$. My question is, does the above hold Ã©tale locally? In other words, taking an Ã©tale cover of $X$, pulling back the ideal sheaf to this cover, I can compute the blowup on the cover. Will this be an Ã©tale cover for the blowup $\text{Bl}_X(\mathscr{I})$? I've tried searching but can't find anyone answering (or asking!) this question.","['blowup', 'algebraic-geometry']"
447651,Count $k$-subsets with at least $d>1$ different elements (pairwise),"The problem of counting the number of $k$-subsets in a set of size $n$ is well known.
The answer is ${n \choose k}$. But here, I want $k$-subsets with the property that any two of them have at least $d$ different elements. If we take the set $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ ($n=6$), we have 15 4-subsets. (no need to enumerate them.) 
If you want those subsets to have at least 2 different elements pairwise, then the maximum number I could find is 3. ($\{1, 2, 3, 4\}, \{1, 2, 5, 6\}, \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$). I am working with neuronal networks (kind of), and I want to represent symbols with $k$ neurons. But to ensure some difference between representation, I would like these subsets to be different enough (typically $d = k/2$). We also have $n >>k$. Any (lower or upper) bound would be helpful. For example an approximation could use ${n/d \choose k/d}$ with proper rounding, but that is a bit rough. Any simpler solution is also welcome, eg: $k$ even, $d=k/2$, $n=0 \mod k$ $d=2$ etc. Thanks for your consideration.","['elementary-set-theory', 'combinatorics']"

Evaluate $$\int_{0}^{1}{x\mathrm{d}\alpha(x)}$$ Attempt: I dont know how to put this formally, but I know it is similar to problem of evaluating the R-S integral where $\alpha(x)$ is the jump function. 
So If I evaluate the function $\alpha(x)$ for some values of $n$ then the function looks like this $$\alpha(x) = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{cc} 0 & x=0\\ \vdots & \vdots \\\dfrac{1}{8} & \dfrac{1}{27} < x \leq \dfrac{1}{9} \\ \dfrac{1}{4} & \dfrac{1}{9} < x \leq \dfrac{1}{3} \\ \dfrac{1}{2} & \dfrac{1}{3} < x \leq 1 \end{array}\right.$$ So $f(x)=x$ is continuous and $\alpha(x)$ is monotonically increasing.

The closure of a set $A$ is defined by $Cl(A)=A\cup Fr(A)$ Suppose $Fr(A)\subseteq \mathbb{R^n}-A$. As $A$ is closed, $\forall x\in \mathbb{R^n}-A, \exists N_x$ such that $N_x\cap A=\emptyset$. This is true for every $x\in Fr(A)$ (by assumption). But $x\in Fr(A) \implies$ every neighborhood of $x$ intersect $A$ non-trivially; a contradiction. So $Fr(A)\subseteq A$. Conversely, suppose $Fr(A)\subseteq A$ and let $x\notin A$, then $\exists N$ neighborhood of $x$ such that $N\cap A=\emptyset$ thus $A$ is closed. Suppose $A$ is closed, then $Fr(A)\subseteq A \implies Fr(A)\cup A \subseteq A \implies Cl(A)\subseteq A$. As $A\subseteq Cl(A)$ for any $A$, it follows that $A=Cl(A)$. Conversely, suppose $A=Cl(A)=A\cup Fr(A)$, then $Fr(A)\subseteq A$ thus $A$ is closed (by the previous result). As $Fr(Fr(A))\subseteq Fr(A)$, it follows (by 1.) that $Fr(A)$ is closed. Let $x\in Fr(A)$, then $\exists$ neighborhood $N$ such that $N\cap A\neq \emptyset$ and $N\cap (\mathbb{R^n}-A)\neq \emptyset$. As $A=\mathbb{R^n}-(\mathbb{R^n}-A)$, it follows that $N\cap (\mathbb{R^n}-(\mathbb{R^n}-A))\neq \emptyset$ and $N\cap (\mathbb{R^n}-)\neq \emptyset$ thus $x\in Fr(\mathbb{R^n}-A)$.

I tried plugging in different numbers for $n$ that would make $f(n) > n^3$.  I found that setting $n = 7$ makes sure that $f(n)$ is greater than $g(n)$.  So, is that my answer?

I'm having a lot of trouble with this seemingly simple problem. I'm trying to do this with stars and bars. Am I correct or on the right track at least? First, I put two bars in for my two 0's, and then put one 1 in between them to make sure the 0's are not adjacent. |x| This leaves me with 5 more 1's to place in the bit string. example: x|xx|xxx would be one distribution of the 5 remaining 1's. So, this gives me c(3+5-1,3-1), or c(7,2)=21 ways. The only other way I could think to do this problem would be to get the total # of ways to have a bit string of length 8 with exactly two 0's, and subtract the total number of ways to have the 0's be adjacent. So, c(8,2) for the total number of was to have exactly two 0's, and subtract the total number of ways I can have exactly two 0's in a bit string where the 0's are adjacent which is 7. This gives me c(8,2)=28 and 28-7=21. This confirms my answer (if either of these methods are correct that is). Thanks!",['combinatorics']

447848,Measurability problem of sample distribution function of a contiuum of independent random variable,"Let $I = [0,1]$ be the index set of a contiuum of i.i.d random variables. For each $t \in I$, the sample space of $X_t$ is $\Bbb R$ equipped with Borel $\sigma$-algebra and Borel probability measure. By Kolmogorov extension theorem , we have a unique probability measure on the sample space $\Omega = {\Bbb R}^{I}$. Specifically, for each Lebesgue measurable subset of $\Bbb R$, $A$, we have $A^t = \{\omega \in \Omega: \omega(t) = A\}$. Then all sets of the form $A_t$ constitute a $\pi$-system that generates the $\sigma$-algebra of $\Omega$, which is, $\mathscr{F}$. The measure $\mu$ of $\Omega$ must be consistent with finite dimentional distributions in the sense that: $$\mu(A^t) = m(A)$$ $$\mu(\bigcap_{1 \leq i \leq n}A^{t_i}) = \prod_{1 \leq i \leq n} \mu(A^{t_i}) $$
The mapping $i \mapsto t_i$ is one-on-one for each $n$.$(\omega, \mathscr{F}, \mu)$ is the desired probability space. For each $c \in \Bbb R$, the sample distribution function $F_{\omega}(\cdot)$ is defined as: $$F_{\omega}(c) = l(\{ t \in I: X_t(\omega) \leq c\})$$ $l$ is the lesbesgue measure. In Judd(1985) (Paywall required), in $\sf {ZFC}$, $\omega_c = \{t \in I: X_t(\omega)  \leq c\}$ could be non-measurable, thus $F_{\omega}(c)$ could also be non-measurable.

$$\langle A(t)u,v \rangle = a(t;u,v)$$
such that $a(\cdot,u,v) \in L^\infty(0,T).$ We also have that $a(t;\cdot,\cdot)$ is bounded in $V \times V$. I wish to show that $$t \mapsto A(t)u(t)$$ is measureable for every $u \in \mathcal V$. Proof: It suffices to show, by Pettis thoerem, that $t \mapsto A(t)u(t)$ is weakly measurable since $V'$ is separable and Banach. So let $g \in V''=V$. Then 
$$\langle g, A(t)u(t) \rangle_{V'',V'} = \langle A(t)u(t), g \rangle_{V',V} = a(t;u(t),g)$$
which by assumption is measurable since it is in $L^\infty(0,T)$. Hence $$t \mapsto A(t)u(t)$$ is measurable. What is wrong with this proof?

Let $G$ be a finite group. Suppose we have a word on $k$ letters and we want to write a given $g \in G$ using that word (for example, if $k=2$, we'd be looking at the number of ways $g$ can be written as a product, which should be $|G|$). For the case where the word is a product of $m$ commutators (so that $k=2m$), the following procedure should give the number of ways we can write the identity element as that word: Let $\delta$ be the regular character of $G$ and $w$ be the word (which is a product of $m$ commutators). So $\delta$ takes value $|G|$ at the identity and $0$ at every other element. So $\sum_{\vec{g} \in G^{2m}} \delta(w(\vec{g}))=|G| \gamma(w)$, where $\gamma(w)$ is the number of ways we can write the identity with $w$. So we are able to calculate $\gamma$(w). If $w$ is a product of $m$ commutators, one may also prove that $\gamma(w)=|G|^{2m-1}\zeta(2m-2)$, where $\zeta$ is Witten's zeta function ($\zeta(k)=\sum_{\chi} \chi(1)^{-k}$, where the sum is taken over all irreducible characters).

As $A$ is open, there is an open nbhd $N$ of $x$ such that $x\in N \subseteq A$. This implies that $N\cap (\mathbb{R^n}-A)=\varnothing$. Conversely, suppose that $\mathbb{R^n}-A$ is closed. Every point $x\notin \mathbb{R^n}-A$ has a nbhd $N$ with $N\cap (\mathbb{R^n}-A)=\varnothing$, thus $N$ lies entirely inside $A$ (i.e., $x\in N \subseteq A$). So $A$ is open.

448064,Show that the boundary of $A$ is empty iff $A$ is closed and open.,"I'm reading Intro to Topology by Mendelson. The problem at hand is, Show that $\text{Bdry}(A)=\emptyset$ if and only if $A$ is closed and open. This was all the problem statement had, but I'm in the chapter covering closure, interior and boundary with respect to topological spaces. Here is my attempt at the proof, Suppose that Bdry$(A)=\emptyset$. Then $\bar{A}=A$ $\cup$ Bdry$(A)=A\cup\emptyset=A$. Hence, $\bar{A}=A$, which implies that $A$ is closed. To show that $A$ is also open we will show that $\overline{C(A)}=C(A)$, that is, $C(A)$ is closed and hence $A$ open. We already know that $C(A)\subset\overline{C(A)}$, thus it suffices to only show that $\overline{C(A)}\subset C(A)$. This is the case since we know that Bdry$(A)=\bar{A}\cap\overline{C(A)}=\emptyset$, which implies that $\overline{C(A)}\subset C(\bar{A})=$ Int$(C(A))\subset C(A)$. Thus, $A$ is open. Suppose now that $A$ is both open and closed. Since $A$ is open we know that Int$(A)=A$. Also, since $A$ is closed $\bar{A}=A=$ Int$(A)$. Now we know that Bdry$(A)=\bar{A}\cup\overline{C(A)}=$ Int$(A)$ $\cup$ $C($Int$(A))=\emptyset.$ I used an the identity $\bar{A}=A\cup\text{Bdry}(A)$, which was asked later in the problem set. I'm wondering if I should use this, since I was able to prove it, or attempt the proof assuming I'm unaware of the identity.

448108,Limit of $\sin (a^{n}\theta\pi)$ as $ n \to \infty$ where $a$ is an integer greater than $2$,"In Hardy's Pure Mathematics, Hardy discusses the limit $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\sin (2^{n}\theta\pi)$$ and says that if this limit exists it must be zero and then $\theta$ must be a rational number whose denominator is a power of $2$. Then he asks the reader to consider the limit $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\sin (a^{n}\theta\pi)$$ where $a$ is an integer greater than $2$. It is also mentioned that when $a > 2$ then the limit can be non-zero and as an example Hardy states that if $a = 9$ and $\theta = 1/2$ then the above limit is $1$. In this case I reasoned (based on Hardy's technique for the case $a = 2$) that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sin((9^{n}\pi)/2)$ will be $1$ only when we can write $$\frac{9^{n}\pi}{2} = 2b_{n}\pi + \frac{\pi}{2} + c_{n}$$ for all sufficiently large values of $n$, where $\{b_{n}\}$ is a sequence which takes only integer values and $\{c_{n}\}$ is a sequence which tends to zero as $n \to \infty$. Thus we get $\displaystyle \begin{aligned}9^{n}\pi &= 4b_{n}\pi + \pi + 2c_{n}\\
\Rightarrow (9^{n} - 1)\pi &= 4b_{n}\pi + 2c_{n}\end{aligned}$ Since $9^{n} - 1$ is divisible by $9 - 1 = 8$ and hence also by $4$, it follows that we can take $b_{n} = (9^{n} - 1)/4$ and $c_{n} = 0$. The same logic could be applied when $a$ is any integer of the form $a = 4m + 1$ and $\theta = 1/2$. But, and this is my question, how does one handle the case for general integer $a > 2$ and any real $\theta$ rational or irrational? EDIT: I should also provide more details so that readers get the full context. For the specific case when $a = 2$ Hardy reasons that if the limit exists and, say is equal to $l$, then we must have $|l| \leq 1$ so that we have a constant $\alpha = \sin^{-1} l$ lying in interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. Since the solution of $\sin x = \sin \alpha$ is given by $x = m\pi + (-1)^{m}\alpha$ for all integers $m$, we can see that the existence of limit $l$ entails that $$2^{n}\theta\pi = b_{n}\pi + (-1)^{b_{n}}\alpha + c_{n}$$ where $b_{n}$ takes integer values and $c_{n} \to 0$ as $n\to\infty$. We can now see that $$2^{n}\theta = b_{n} + (-1)^{b_{n}}\beta + d_{n}$$ where $\beta = \alpha/\pi$ so that $\beta \in [-1/2, 1/2]$ and $d_{n} = c_{n}/\pi \to 0$ as $n \to\infty$. Hardy somehow assumes that $b_{n}$ will always be even and then proceeds as follows: $\displaystyle 2^{n}\theta = b_{n} + \beta + d_{n}$ so that multiplication by $2$ gives $\displaystyle 2^{n + 1}\theta = 2b_{n} + 2\beta + 2d_{n}$ and also we have $\displaystyle 2^{n + 1}\theta = b_{n + 1} + \beta + d_{n + 1}$ and therefore we get $\displaystyle (b_{n + 1} - 2b_{n}) - \beta + (d_{n + 1} - 2d_{n}) = 0$ After this Hardy uses simple arguments to show that $\beta = 0$ and $d_{n}$ should be identically zero from a certain value of $n = n_{0}$ so that $2^{n_{0}}\theta = b_{n_{0}}$ and thus $\theta$ is rational with denominator a power of $2$. In the above I don't understand why he assumes $b_{n}$ as even. Also I think the argument can be continued without assuming parity of $b_{n}$ but I am not sure. I wonder how this can be carried forward for higher values of $a$.",['calculus']

Let $(C,\tau)$ be the topological vector space defined by the seminorms $$p_x(f)=|f(x)| \quad (0\le x \le 1).$$ Prove that every $\tau-$bounded set in $C$ is also $\sigma-$bounded and that the identity map 
$id:(C,\tau)\to (C,\sigma)$ therefore carries bounded sets into bounded sets. *Because of the definition of our seminorm, a set $E$ is $\tau-$bounded if and only if for each $x\in [0,1]$ there exists $M_x \ge 0$ such that $p_x(f)=|f(x)| \le M_x$ for all $f\in E$.

448206,How can a point of symmetry have a slope which isn't either $0$ or $Â±\infty$?,"I've got a bit of a doubt with a question I'm solving. It goes like this: For $a>0$, let $f:[-4a,4a] \to R$ be an even function such that $f(x) = f(4a - x) \hspace{2 mm}\forall x \in [2a, 4a]$ and 
  $$\lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(2a + h) - f(2a)}{h} = 4,$$
  then
  $$\lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(h-2a) - f(-2a)}{2h} = \hspace{2mm}?,$$ Here's my reasoning: It's been given that the function is even , so it's obviously symmetric about the y-axis. Another piece of information which has been give is that $f(x) = f(4a - x) \hspace{2 mm}\forall x\in [2a, 4a]$.
So it's gotta be symmetric about the line $x = 2a$ in the interval $ x\in[0,4a]$ too. So the graph would look something like this: Either that, or a cusp or a sharp corner would exist at $x = Â±2a$. But, in the question, it's given that $$\lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(2a + h) - f(2a)}{h} = 4,$$ which means that the slope of the graph at $x = 2a$ is $4$. How is this possible, if the only options are: as in the graph, a maxima (or a minima) exists, thus the slope is $0$. a sharp corner exists - which means that the derivative isn't defined at the point. a cusp exists - which means the slope is either $Â±\infty$!

448468,closure of a set is closed,"I know that the closure of a set is closed and the proof can be found in Rudin. However this is done by using the fact that the complement of a closed set is open. I am using a different book now and it is asked in the exercises to show that the closure of a set is closed. The only thing mentioned about closed sets so far in this book is that it contains all of its accumulation points. The accumulation point $x$ of a set $E$ is such that $\forall c>0, (x-c,x+c)\cap {E}$ contains infinitely many points. Now I am trying to establish the above fact using only this definition of a closed set presented so far. However, I am stuck... If $\bar{E}$ denotes closure, $\bar{E} = E \cup E'$ where $E'$ is the set of all accumulation points of $E$. Then let $x$ be an accumulation point of $\bar{E}$. I want to show that $x \in \bar{E}$. Since $x$ is an accumulation point, $\forall c>0, (x-c,x+c)\cap {\bar{E}}$ contains infinitely many points. But $(x-c,x+c)\cap {\bar{E}} = \{(x-c,x+c)\cap E\} \cup \{(x-c,x+c)\cap E'\}$. So either  $\{(x-c,x+c)\cap E\}$, or $\{(x-c,x+c)\cap E'\}$, or both contains infinitely many points. If  $\{(x-c,x+c)\cap E\}$ contains infinitely many points, $x\in E' \subset \bar{E}$.

448605,Continuity together with finite additivity implies countable additivity,"I'm working through chapter 2 of Royden (4th ed.). The problem is Show that continuity together with finite additivity of measure implies countable additivity of measure. My proof: Let $\{F_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ be a countable collection of disjoint measurable sets and define $E_n$ by
$$E_1=F_1$$
$$E_k=E_{k-1}\cup F_k$$ 
for $k\geq 2$. So then $E_k\subset E_{k+1}$, where each $E_i$ is measurable. By construction we have,
$$\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty F_k=\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k.$$ Also, since the sets $F_i$ are disjoint,
$$m(E_k)=m(F_1)+\dots+m(F_k).$$
Thus we have,
\begin{align}
m\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty F_k\right)&=m\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k\right) \nonumber \\
&=\lim_{k\to\infty} m(E_k) \nonumber \\

Let $V$ be a $2$ dimensional $\mathbb{F}_p$-representation of $G_K$ which is a non-split extension of $\omega$ by $\omega$.
