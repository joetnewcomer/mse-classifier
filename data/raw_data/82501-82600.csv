1076456,"Proving that if the semigroup (A, *) is a group, then the relation is an equivalence relation.","I'm aware that posting exam questions is probably frowned upon, but this isn't homework, I think I'm genuinely misunderstanding some part of the algebra. The question is this: Throughout this question, we shall denote by $\neg$ the relation on a semigroup $(A, * )$ defined so that elements x and y of the semigroup satisfy the relation $x \neg y$ if and only if there exists some element $s$ of the semigroup $A$ such that $s * x = y * s$ Prove the relation $\neg$ is a transitive relation on $A$ for all semigroups $(A, *)$. Prove that the relation $\neg$ is a reflexive relation on $A$ for all semigroups $(A, *)$. Prove that if the semigroup $(A, *)$ is a group, then the relation $\neg$ on $A$ is an equivalence relation. Prove that if $(A, *)$ is a group, and if the relation $\neg$ is a partial order on $A$, then the binary operation $*$ of the group $A$ is commutative. I've proven it's transitive and reflexive without too much hassle, but can't get past 3. My approach was such that I'd start with some $s$ such that $s * x = y * s$, and then play around with this equation until I'd get some new term, in terms of $x^{-1}$ and $y^{-1}$ such that (some term) * y = x * (some term), but I keep running around in circles. Then I thought $s * x = y * s$ doesn't capture enough information about the problem in order to be molded into the solution, but I can't see what else I can add into it. Thanks in advance, sorry about posting an exam question, but I figure this should expose something I'm missing in all similar problems.","['semigroups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

1076472,"Eisenbud/Haris, Exercice I-53: morphism between global spectra","Let $X=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathscr{F})$ and $Y=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathscr{G})$ two global spectra over a scheme $S$ and let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism. I want to show that for all prime ideal sheaf $\mathscr{P}\in X$ one has $f(\mathscr{P})=(f^\#)^{-1}(f_*(\mathscr{P}))$. My idea was to localize: as $\mathscr{Q}=f(\mathscr{P})\neq\mathscr{G}$ one has $W\subseteq S$ such that $\mathscr{Q}(W)\neq\mathscr{G}(W)$ and so there is $\sigma\in W$ with $\mathscr{Q}\in V_{W,\sigma}\simeq\operatorname{Spec}(\mathscr{G}(W)_\sigma)\ni\mathscr{Q}(W)$. 
One has $\mathscr{P}\in f^{-1}(V_{W,\sigma})$ open so there is $U\subseteq S$ and $\gamma\in\mathscr{F}(U)$ so that $\mathscr{P}\in V_{U,\gamma}\simeq\operatorname{Spec}(\mathscr{F}(U)_\gamma)\ni\mathscr{P}(U)$ and $V_{U,\gamma}\subseteq f^{-1}(V_{W,\sigma})$. On affine schemes one has $\mathscr{Q}(V)=(f_{|V_{U,\gamma}}^\#)^{-1}(\mathscr{P}(U))$ and with the quasicoherence property $f(\mathscr{P})=\left(f_{|V_{U,\gamma}}^\#\right)^{-1}((f_{|V_{U,\gamma}})_*(\mathscr{P}))$ but then it is not clear to me why I could erase the restrictions. So question is: is my idea good and then how to conclude, and if it is not how to prove $f(\mathscr{P})=(f^\#)^{-1}(f_*(\mathscr{P}))$.","['affine-schemes', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
1076474,Cardinal Arithmetic proof issues.,"Let $X$ be a finite set and let $x$ be an object which is not an element of $X$. Then $X \cup \{x\}$ is finite and $|X \cup \{x\}| = |X| + 1$. Proof. 
Let X be a finite set with cardinality n, denoted by #X, then there exists a bijection;
$$f:X \rightarrow \{ i \in N : 1 \le i \le n\} $$. Since x is not an element of X then  $$X \cup \{x\} $$ is the set of elements that contains X or {x}, then there must exist a bijection $$ g:X \cup \{x\} \rightarrow  \{ i \in N : 1 \le i \le n++\} $$
By the definition of cardinality of finite sets $$X \cup \{x\} $$ has cardinality n++, that is n+1, denoted by  #(X U {x}) .

1076484,Point in which all three sets meet,"The entire 2-dimensional plane is covered by 3 sets: Blue, Green and Red. It is given that: All sets are closed. All sets are interior-disjoint (but may meet at their boundaries). Blue is bounded. Blue meets both Red and Green (i.e. their boundaries have non-empty intersection). The following diagram illustrates the given facts (not the entire coloring): I would like to prove that there is a point in which all 3 sets meet. The intuition is that, if we start from the intersection of Blue and Green and move along the boundary of Blue, we must somewhere meet the Red boundary, since the entire plane is covered. However, there are probably some cases in which this is not true. If this is so, what conditions do I need to add in order to make sure that the intuitive conclusion is true?",['general-topology']

More precisely for all $y \in Y$ there exists $x \in X$ such that $y = T(x)$ and $\|x\| \leq \frac{M}{1-\delta}\|y\|$, i.e. $T\left(\frac{M}{1-\delta}B_X\right) \supseteq B_Y$.

1076615,Properties of solutions to the associated Legendre ODE,"The associated Legendre ODE is given by $$  \left( (1-x^2) f'(x) \right)' - \frac{m^2}{1-x^2} f(x) = \lambda f(x)$$ The eigenfunctions have certain properties that I would like to understand by looking NOT at the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues but only by referring to the ODE itself. So please pretend that you are not aware of the fact that you can construct the two things analytically. Then, we have that the eigenfunctions are all $C^{\infty}$ if we exclude the Legendre-polynomials of the second kind, can we see this directly from the differential equation? Probably this follows for the Legendre polynomials somehow if we require boundedness of the solutions at the end of the interval to exclude the Legendre polynomials of the second kind. But how does this follow for the associated Legendre polynomials, i.e. then the ODE has an additional singular term that could cause additional trouble? Despite, all the solutions are proper well-behaved functions, so we should somehow see this out of the ODE itself. Furthermore, if we increase $m$, then the ground-state solutions get higher. I mean, if we start with $m=0$, then the ground-state is $\lambda=0$, for $m=1$ we have $\lambda= 1(1+1)=2$ and for $m=2$ we have $\lambda = 2(2+1)=6$.

Then, after a lot of debates, we introduced imaginary numbers thanks to the imaginary unit $i$ and we classified them along with real numbers in the complex set $\mathbb{C}$. But if you're reading this, you certainly already now all that.

1076688,Multitangent to a polynomial function,"I'm trying to build some exercises on tangents of functions for beginner students in mathematical analysis. In particular I would like to suggest the study of polynomial functions  $ y = p (x) $ of which is possible to determine the graph with elementary methods and also determine (if it exists) the  $n$-tangent, i.e. a straight line $ y = mx + q $ (with $ m \ne 0$  to avoid trivial solutions) which has $ n $ distinct points of tangency with the graph and no other intersection points with it, so that the system
$$
\begin{cases}
y=p(x)\\
y=mx+q
\end{cases}
$$ 
has $n$ double solutions. For bi-tangents I find, for example, functions of the form:
$$
y= a(x^4-3k^2x^2+2k^3x)
$$
that have as bi-tangents the straight lines 
$$
y=2ak^3x-\dfrac{9}{4}ak^3
$$
or:
$$
y=a\left( \dfrac{1}{4}x^4 -\dfrac{3k}{2}x^3+\dfrac{9k^2}{4}x^2-k^3x\right)
$$
with bi-tangents  $y=ak^3x$. I cannot, however, find an example with a $ 3 $ -tangent, i.e. a polynomial of sixth degree $ y = p (x) $ such that $ p (x) $ and $ p '(x) $ are decomposable (more or less easily) in factors of degree  $n \le 2$, and that at the same time has a $3$-tangent such that hits points of tangency can be determined without using  the general formula to solve a cubic equation.
Someone knows any function of this type, or may suggest an efficient way to find it? In other words: find a function:
$$
y=a_6x^6+a_5x^5+a_4x^4+a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0
$$
such that $ y $ and $y'$ are factorizable with factors of degree $n \le 2$ and there exist $m,q \in \mathbb{R}$ (or better $\in \mathbb{Q}$) such that
$$
a_6x^6+a_5x^5+a_4x^4+a_3x^3+a_2x^2+(a_1-m)x+a_0-q
 =a_6\left( x^3+Bx^2+Cx+D\right)^2

The answer of Michael Burr don't fit the request  that $f(x)$ and $f′(x)$ has roots that we can find solving equations of degree $\le 2$.

I want determine the coefficients of $f(x)$ in such a way that: all the real roots of $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ can be found solving equations of degree $\le 2$, and there are $m,q \in \mathbb{R}$ such that the polynomial $g(x)=f(x)+mx+q$ has $n$ double roots.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\Pr\left[\left|\overline{X}^{(k_n)}-E\left[\overline{X}^{(k_n)}\right]\right|\ge\frac{1}{(1+\varepsilon)^{n/4}}\right]&\le&\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}}(1+\varepsilon)^{n/2}\operatorname{Var}\overline{X}^{(k_n)}\\

1076993,Least Upper Bound Property Implies Greatest Lower Bound Property,"In Rudin $1.11$ Theorem Proof he claims the following Theorem . Suppose $S$ is an ordered set with the least upper bound property $B \subset S$, $B$ is not empty, and $B$ is bounded below. Let $L$ be the set of all lower bounds of $B$. Then 
  $$\alpha = \sup L$$
  exists in $S$, and $\alpha = \inf B$. Proof . Since $B$ is bounded below, $L$ is not empty. Since $L$ consists of exactly those $y \in S$ which satisfy the inequality $y \leq x$ for every $x \in B$, we see that every $x \in B$ is an upper bound of $L$. Thus $L$ is bounded above. Our hypothesis about $S$ implies therefore that $L$ has a supremum in $S$ call it $\alpha$ If $\gamma < \alpha$ then $\gamma$ is not an upper bound of $L$, hence $\gamma \notin B$. It follows that $\alpha \leq x $ for every $x \in B$. Thus $\alpha \in L$ If $\alpha < \beta$ then $\beta \notin L$ since $\alpha$ is an upper bound of $L$ We have shown that $\alpha \in L$ but $\beta \notin L$ if $\beta > \alpha$. In other words, $\alpha$ is a lower bound of $B$, but $\beta $ is not if $\beta > \alpha$. This means that $\alpha = \inf B$ I am confused in the following: I don't follow why $L \subset S$ given $S$ is an ordered set with the least upper bound property and $B \subset S$, $B$ is not empty and $B$ is bounded below. If $L$ is not a subset of $S$, then the assumption of the proof will not follow, I think I have missed something. Can someone help me out?

1077000,Reverse diffusion of a gas,"I have a question about the Ehrenfest model of gas diffusion. Suppose I have two urns, each one with $N = 1,000,000$ balls in it. To start with, the first urn has only black balls, and the second only white ones. Every time the clock ticks, the urns exchange two balls: one chosen at random from the first urn goes to the second, and one similarly in the reverse direction. Over time, the numbers of balls of each kind have a tendency to even out, so that once equilibrium is reached, the system typically spends most of its time hovering around $500,000$ black balls in each urn. However, with probability $1$, after a usually very long finite time, at some point the first urn will be down to, say, 45% black balls, a kind of ""reverse diffusion"" which in physical practice doesn't happen, due to the large number of gas molecules. Nonetheless, let $T$ be the time it takes for the first urn to have $450,000$ black balls for the first time. I would like to know if there is a way to find bounds for the expected value of $T$, the median of $T$, or any other parameters of its distribution. I suppose I'm most interested in the expected value. I would appreciate a reference for this kind of problem if possible. The problem is reminiscent of random walks, but is different because the probability of a step left, a step right, or staying put depends on the present state of the system in such a way that drifting away from the $500,000$ mark becomes less likely.

Background: I thought of the question when proving that ""If a function is periodic and continuous, then the function is uniformly continuous"" ( Proof that a periodic function is bounded and uniformly continuous. ) It turns out that if $f$ has a period of $p$, then $f([0,p]) = f(\mathbb{R})$. Since the image of a continuous function on a compact set is compact, $f(\mathbb{R})$ is compact. Therefore, I was wondering if it is possible to generalize: If $f(\mathbb{R})$ is compact and $f$ is continuous, then is $f$ uniformly continuous? Attempt: Let $f:\mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$ be continuous. Then $f$ is not a bijection (see: http://at.yorku.ca/cgi-bin/bbqa?forum=ask_a_topologist_2011&task=show_msg&msg=2700.0002 ). Let $f(p) = 0$ and let $f(q) = 1$. Without loss of generality, let $p < q$. For all $y \in (0,1)$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a $c \in R$ such that $f(c) = y$ and $p < c < q$. Therefore, $f([p,q]) = f(\mathbb{R}) = [0,1]$. Recall that a continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous. Thus $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,1]$. Let $\epsilon > 0$. For $x,y \in [p,q]^c$ such that $|x-y|< \delta_{[p,q]}$, by the definition of $f$, we have $f(x),f(y) \in [0,1]$. By the intermediate value theorem, there exists $a,b \in [p,q]$ such that $f(a) = f(x)$ and $f(b) = f(y)$. Thus, $|f(a) - f(b)| = |f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$. Finally: Is the theorem correct?

\sigma H \sigma^{-1}=\sigma \langle \mathcal{S} \rangle \sigma^{-1}=\langle \sigma \mathcal{S} \sigma^{-1} \rangle=\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle=H,

so that $H \trianglelefteq S_n$.

Then the $4^{th}$ to last digit must be different from the last 3 so we select it in 9 ways. We then have $10^5$ ways to select the starting 5 digits.

The 5-Sylow subgroup is normal if and only if $s=1$, and in this case $G$ is not simple. (3) Now look at Nirdonkey's answer .

If we have enough injectives, then the derived functors of a functor $F$ create a universal Delta-functor, where maps to other delta functors are uniquely determined by the maps on $H^0$. My question is what are some interesting examples of non-universal delta functors for a fixed $H^0$? Clearly we can for example take shifts of the universal one and direct sum them to the original one (after applying some exact functors perhaps). Phrased another way, are there any genuinely different Cohomology theories, or can we somehow ""create"" all others just using the universal one? If this is too general, can we say anything in cases pertaining to Algebraic geometry (e.g. $O_X$-modules on a variety $X$ say).

1077419,"Gradient, towards a maximum or minimum?","I have a question on the gradient of a mutlivariable function. For a function $f: \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$, the gradient is given as 
$$ [\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} \cdots \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}]$$ From the discussion I have read, I agree with the notion that the gradient is exactly the direction of steepest ascent. To motivate my question, I consider a gradient descent algorithm. 
The gradient descent algorithm aims to pick parameters $\vec{\theta} = [\theta_1, \cdots, \theta_n]$ such that the following cost function is minimized. $$J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_{\theta}(x_i) - y_i)^2$$
where $h_{\theta}$ is some function parametrized by $\theta$. The algorithm works by updating $\theta_{j}$ to $\theta_{j}'$ for all $j$ using the following update rule. 
$$ \theta_{j}' = \theta_{j} - \alpha \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_{j}}$$
for some constant $\alpha$. By the definition of gradient, our algorithm gets closer and closer to the minimum each time. I get that the gradient is the direction for the greatest rate of change in the function (this comes from the cosine argument linked below), but that could mean both increase or decrease? Why is it that the slope of the gradient is always pointing to a local maximum and not a minimum? Why is gradient the direction of steepest ascent?",['multivariable-calculus']

One can solve for the saddle points of $\phi$: $$z_{1,2}=\frac{1-n-n^2\pm \sqrt{1-6n+3n^2+2n^3+n^4}}{2(n^2-n)},$$ with taylor series: $$z_1=-1-\frac{2}{n}+O(1/n^2)$$
$$z_2=\frac{1}{n^2}+O(1/n^3).$$ It looks like $z_2$ is the maximum saddle, and $z_1$ the minimum. So to get asymptotics of $F(n)$, we need to deform the vertical line contour to the steepest-descent contour, passing through $z_2$. The steepest descent contour looks like this: I have some questions. First, I'm having trouble solving for the contour of steepest-descent through $z_2$, in other words $Im(\phi(n,z))=0$, passing through $z_2$. The equation is rather nasty, and probably transcendental. Is it sufficient to somehow approximate this contour to some order in $n$? The issue is that I'm thinking I need to parametrize the steepest descent contour with some running variable $t$, so that $\Gamma_t=z_2+f_n(t)$, where $f_n(0)=0$. Also, $z_2$ depends on $n$, and so I'm thinking I need a parametrization of $\Gamma_t$ that's somehow uniform in $n,t$ for $t$ near zero and $n$ large. Ultimately, it looks like I need to perform some sort of rescaling in the integral in terms of $z$. I was thinking of trying $u=z\cdot z_1$, so that the saddle point gets moved to $u=1$. But I'm still stuck in getting some kind of a uniform estimate on $\phi(n,z)$ near $z_1$, along the contour of steepest descent. Note that the integral has singularities at $z=\pm 1$ and $z=0$. In particular, $z_2\rightarrow 0$, so this further complicates taylor expansions of $\phi(n,z)$ near $z_2$. I've also noticed that $\phi^{(k)}(n,z_1)$ looks like a growing polynomial in $n$, e.g. $n^k$, so I can't seem to truncate taylor series for $\phi(n,z)$ around $z_1$ so that it's uniform in $n,z$.

Then $div(GH)= div(H')+D´+E+ A \geq div(H')+E$. Let $F$ be the form defining $C$.

  that there exists a real number $K\geq 0$ such that 
  $\lvert\,f^\prime(x)\rvert\leq K\lvert\,f(x)\rvert,$
  for all $x\in [0,b]$. Prove that $f$ is identically zero. The problem provides the following ""hint"": First, show that there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $f$ is zero on $[0,\delta]$. At first I thought the hint seemed a bit odd, as of course $\delta = b$ would answer the whole problem. But then I started thinking that the hint probably meant that, if we could show that $f$ is zero on even a small (right-sided?) neighbourhood of $0$, that that would be enough to show $f$ must remain zero. In particular, the inequality in the problem would force $\lvert f^\prime(\delta) \rvert \leq K\lvert f(\delta)\rvert=0\implies f^\prime(\delta)=0$. But I'm stuck with what to do next because this of course does not alone imply that $f(x)=0$ for $x>\delta$. Proving the hint itself has also evaded me. The wording, to me, implies that there's some property ,other than whatever properties would prove the general problem, we can use to produce this specific $\delta$, because otherwise, the hint would be useless. My first thought was to use the fact that $f$ is continuous at $0$ (and $f(0)=0$): Given $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that $0<x<\delta$ implies $\lvert\,f(x)\rvert<\varepsilon$. 
I find myself wanting to use the Mean Value Theorem at this point: there exists $c\in (0,\delta)$ such that $f^\prime(c)=\dfrac{f(\delta)}{\delta}$. We can use the given inequality to produce $$
\frac{\lvert\, f^\prime(\delta)\rvert}{K\delta}
\leq\left|\frac{f(\delta)}{\delta}\right|
=\lvert\, f^\prime(c)\rvert\leq K\lvert\, f(c)\rvert <K\varepsilon.
$$ Now, we could of course use $\varepsilon/K$ in the definition of continuity so that the previous inequality chain ends with $\epsilon$ instead of $K\epsilon$, but that's not the real issue: getting 
$\lvert\, f(\delta)\lvert<\delta\varepsilon$ looks promising until I realize that $\delta$ depends on $\varepsilon$, so all this really says is that $\lim\limits_{\delta\to 0^+}f(\delta)=0$, which is quite unsurprising. So I suppose I need help with the hint itself as well as how it implies the result of the problem. I will note that this problem comes from a problem set that is supposed to be on the Riemann integral, but I have no idea how integration would come up here. I think we could claim that either $f(x)\geq 0 \,\forall\, x$ or $f(x)\leq 0 \,\forall\, x$; otherwise, $f$ would have a zero at a point where its derivative is nonzero, contradicting the inequality in the problem. If we could show that $\int_0^b f(x)\,dx=0$, it would then follow that $f$ is zero on $[0,b]$, but I don't see what could be said about the integral from the assumptions we're given.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'integration', 'continuity', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives']"

1077710,A question on Terence Tao's representation of Peano Axioms,"While reading Terence Tao's book on Analysis I had some questions regarding the implication  of the Peano Axioms. After writing the following four axioms (which I will write without changing their original numbering), Axiom 2.1 $0$ is a natural number. Axiom 2.2 If $n$ is a natural number then $n{+\!+}$ is also a natural number. (Here $n{+\!+}$ denotes the successor of $n$ and previously in the book the notational implication has been bijected to the familiar $1, 2\ldots$ ). Axiom 2.3 $0$ is not the successor of natural number; i.e. we have $n{+\!+}\neq 0$ for every natural number $n$ . Axiom 2.4 Different natural numbers must have different successors; i.e., if $n, m$ are natural numbers and $n\neq m$ , then $n{+\!+}\neq m{+\!+}$ . Now let me quote the portion of the text from which my question arises, ""As one can see from this proposition, it now looks like we can keep all of the natural numbers distinct from each other. There is however still one more problem: while the axioms (particularly Axioms $2.1$ and $2.2$ ) allow us to confirm that $0,1,2,3,\ldots$ are distinct elements of $\mathbb{N}$ , there is the problem that there may be other
  "" $\color{red}{\text{rogue}}$ "" elements in our number system which are not of this form:... ...What we want is some axiom which says that the only numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ are those which can be obtained from $0$ and the increment operation - in order to exclude elements such as $0.5$ . But it is difficult to quantify what we mean by ""can be obtained from""
  without already using the natural numbers, which we are trying to define. Fortunately, there is an ingenious solution to try to capture this fact: Axiom 2.5 Let $P(n)$ be any property pertaining to a natural number $n$ . Suppose that $P(0)$ is true, and suppose that whenever $P(n)$ is true, $P(n{+\!+})$ is also
    true. Then $P(n)$ is true for every natural number $n$ . The informal intuition behind this axiom is the following. Suppose $P(n)$ is such that $P(0)$ is true, and such that whenever $P(n)$ is true, then $P(n{+\!+})$ is true. Then since $P(0)$ is true, $P(0{+\!+}) = P(1)$ is true. Since $P(1)$ is true, $P(1{+\!+}) = P(2)$ is
  true. Repeating this indefinitely, we see that $P(0), P(1), P(2), P(3),$ etc. are all true- however this line of reasoning will never let us conclude that $P(0.5)$ , for instance, is true. $\color{blue}{\text{Thus Axiom 2.5 should not hold for number systems which contain}}$ "" $\color{blue}{\text {unnecessary}}$ "" $\color{blue}{\text {elements such as $0.5$.}}$ My questions are precisely regarding the colored statements. How can we assume the existence of "" $\color{red}{\text{rogue}}$ "" elements in our number system? To be precise, how can one who doesn't know anything about the number system and the numbers try to convince himself of the existence of such elements? Which $P(n)$ only holds for the natural numbers? In other words, how the addition of the fifth axiom resolves the problem of the rogue elements ? Added:- After reading the various answers below, I think that I should elaborate why the answers below doesn't completely satisfy me. What KSmarts said in response to my first question seems circular to me. To quote from his answer, Suppose that in addition to the expected natural numbers $0,1,2,$ etc $\color{green}{\color{green}{\text{there are numbers}}\  a,b, \color{green}{\text{and}}\ c  \ \color{green}{\text{so that}}\ a{+\!+}=b, b{+\!+}=c,\  \color{green}{\text{and}}\ c{+\!+}=a}$ . This does not contradict any of the first four axioms, so it is a valid construction under those axioms. However, it does not correspond to what we expect of the natural numbers, so there is another axiom to restrict this construction. The colored portion is the reason for which I think that the answer is circular. Precisely my question is that how do we convince someone the existence of those $a,b,c$ 's who doesn't know anything about the numbers? Hurkyl raised a good point which tries to resolve the above question, For your first question, it's not that we assume that rogue elements exist, it's that we cannot assume they do not exist. If we wish that they do not exist, we must choose a definition that allows us to prove it. ""...it's that we cannot assume they do not exist."" Exactly! But in my view we can choose a definition to ""prove"" that such rogue elements don't $\color{darkviolet}{\text{only when}}$ we know the properties of those elements. For then we can ""construct"" the definition in a way which excludes the possibility of such rogue elements. So, How can we know the properties that only belongs to the rogue elements, unless we have a proper idea of the nature of those rogue elements? And it's precisely in the light of this question that my second question naturally arises. If we know the properties of the rogue elements, then we can define the property $P$ to be the ""complement"" of the properties which satisfy question my last question.","['peano-axioms', 'real-analysis']"

1077802,Equality of measure sets of dynamical system,"This is a homework question I have been crunching my brains on for a lot of time, but unfortunately I'm stuck. I would greatly appreciate any help! The problem is as follows: We have some continuous map $f: A \rightarrow A$ of a compact metric space $(X, d)$. Denote $\tilde{A}$ the space $\{a \in A^{Z} | f(a)_n = (a)_{n+1} \}$. Then we can extend $f$ with $ \tilde{f} : \tilde{A} \rightarrow \tilde{A}$, where $\tilde{f}(a_{n}) = a_{n+1}$ for all $n$. (so a shift) $\tilde{A}$ has metric $\tilde{d}(a, b) = \sum_{Z} 2^{|-i|}d(a_i, b_i)$ Write $\pi : \tilde{A} \rightarrow A$  for the map sending $a$ to $a_0$. Now show that $\pi_* M(\tilde{f}(\tilde{A})) = M(f(A)$, where $M$ stands for the set of Borel probability measures on $A$. my thoughts: to start, I understand that $\pi$ is a topological factor map and that $\tilde{A}$ is some kind of an orbit space. Also I think that I have to construct a measure on $\tilde{A}$ given a measure on $A$that is compatible with $\pi$ So I thought this would be a good cylinder-like construction. Let $\mu$ be some measure on $A$. Now let $B \subset \tilde{A}$. Then define measure $\tilde{\mu}(B) := \prod_Z \mu(\cup_{b\in B}(b_i))$. because this measure is I think a probability measure, and also it is easy to go from a measure of this form to a measure on $A$. But how can I possibly show that measures are of such a product form? or is that even true? And how can I now show that this is an actual measure on all open sets? Now I only know how it behaves on cylinders. Or don't I even need an explicit construction? Please let me know if you have any thoughts, directions, hints etc!
