18802,$C^\infty$ vs. $C^\omega$ surfaces,"I would appreciate it if someone could explain the difference(s) between a
$C^\infty$ and a $C^\omega$ surface embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
I ran across these terms in M. Berger's Geometry Revealed book (p.387).
The context is: There are examples of two different $C^\infty$ compact surfaces
that are isometric, but no known examples for ""two real analytic (class $C^\omega$)""
surfaces which are isometric.  Thanks! Clarification. Thanks to Mariano and Willie for trying to help---I appreciate that!
It is difficult to be clear when you are confused :-).
Let me try two more specific questions: (1) Where does the $\omega$ enter into
the definition of $C^\omega$? Presumably $\omega$ is the first infinite ordinal.
(2) What I'm really after is the geometric ""shape differences"" between $C^\infty$ and $C^\omega$.  The non-analytic but smooth functions I know smoothly join, say, an exponential to a straight line, but geometrically they look just like smooth functions.  I guess I don't understand what the constraints of real-analyticity imply geometrically.  Maybe that's why this isometric question Berger mentioned is unsolved?! Addendum. Here are Ryan's two functions: Left: $C^\infty$ but not $C^\omega$. Right: $C^\omega$.","['geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

18818,For teaching: Combinatorial Construction Riddles,"Can you give examples of combinatorial construction riddles, approachable by gifted high school students? Examples : Find a finite set $A$ and $B \subset 2^A$ such that any element of $A$ is covered by at least 100 sets in $B$, but $B$ cannot be partitioned into 2 disjoint sets, each covering $A$. Find the shortest sequence of numbers between 1 and K (K=99) such that each pair of numbers are adjacent somewhere in the sequence (1231 is an answer if K=3). Find a systematic way to arrange a round robin tournament between N teams (N even or odd). Find (different methods) to cover the complete graph on 50 vertices by disjoint spanning trees. Motivation : I'm working with gifted high school students. This is part of an excellence program in computer science. We have found these kind of problems adequate for stimulating and identifying the better students, before we teach them algorithmic methods. We also let them find winning strategies for mathematical games at this level of their knowledge.","['education', 'soft-question', 'combinatorics']"
18829,Every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ with finite measure is the disjoint union of a finite number of measurable sets,"I'm trying to prove that if $E \subset \mathbb{R}$ has finite measure and $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\varepsilon>0$, then $E$ is the disjoint union of a finite number of measurable sets, each of which has measure at most $\varepsilon$. Here is what I've done: Let $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\varepsilon>0$. Since $m^{*}(E) < +\infty$, there exists a countable collection $\{I_{k}\}_{k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}}$ of open and bounded intervals (measurable sets) covering $E$ and such that $\sum \limits_{k=1}^{\infty } \ell ( I_{k})<m^{*}( E) +\varepsilon /2$. Define $G_{1}:=I_{1}$, and for each $k\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ such that $k\geq 2$ define $G_{k}:=I_{k}\setminus\cup_{n=1}^{k-1} I_{n}$. Therefore ${\{G_{k}\}}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}}$ is a countable disjoint collection of bounded and measurable sets such that $G:=\cup _{k\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}}G_{k}=\cup _{k\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}}I_{k}$. So, $m^{*}( G) <m^{*}( E) +\varepsilon /2$ and $E\subseteq G$. Now
define $F_{k}:=\overline{G}_{k}$ (the closure of $G_k$). Since $G_{k}\subseteq I_{k}$, we know that $F_{k}\subseteq \overline{I_{k}}$; i.e., each $F_{k}$ is a closed and bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$. By the Heine-Borel Theorem we conclude that each $F_{k}$ is compact. If $x\in \mathbb{R}$, then we define $N( x,\varepsilon) := (x-\varepsilon/2,x+\varepsilon/2)$. For each $k\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ the collection $\{N( x,\varepsilon ) \colon x\in F_{k}\}$ is an open covering of $F_{k}$. The compactness of each $F_{k}$ implies that there exist $x_{1}^{k},\ldots ,x_{n_{k}}^{k}\in F_{k}$, with $n_{k}\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, such that $F_{k}\subseteq \bigcup _{i=1}^{n_{k}}N(x_{i}^{k},\varepsilon ) $. Thus $E\subseteq \cup _{k\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}}G_{k}\subseteq \cup _{k\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}}F_{k}\subseteq \cup _{k\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}}(\cup_{i=1}^{n_{k}}N( x_{i}^{k},\varepsilon ))$ ... I can't figure out how to make this last union over $k$ finite. I suppose I've to use the fact that $m^*(G)<m^*(E)+\varepsilon/2$. I can't see how! If that union is finite, then the problem is solved; one would just have to make some intersections and take some complements. On the other hand, I think that if we remove the hypothesis of finite outer measure on $E$, then the conclusion is the same but with a countably infinite union. Am I right? Thank you in advance.",['measure-theory']
18838,Continuous complex function (2 variables),"Let $f$ be analytic on the open set $G\subset \mathbb{C}$. What's the best way of showing that the function $\phi:G \times G \to \mathbb{C}$ defined by $\phi(z,w)=[f(z)-f(w)]/(z-w)$ for $z \neq w$ and $\phi(z,z)=f'(z)$ is continuous? This is obvious for $z\neq w$, but I'm having some trouble on the points $(z,z)$. I did it one way but I'm not convinced this is good. Edit: Rudin's Proof (for the continuity on the diagonal) Let $z_0\in G$. Since $f$ is analytic, there exists $r>0$ such that $B(a,r)\subset G$ and $|f'(\zeta)-f'(z_0)|<\epsilon$ for all $\zeta \in B(a,r)$. Getting $z,w\in B(a,r)$, than $\zeta(t)=(1-t)z+tw \in B(a,r)$ for $0\le t\le 1$. Now just use that $\phi(z,w)-\phi(z_0,z_0)=\int_0^1[f'(\zeta(t))-f'(z_0)]dt$ and the $\epsilon$-bound to get the desired continuity.",['complex-analysis']
18842,Solving a polynomial system using Groebner basis computations.,"I have discovered that Groebner basis computations may help in a problem I am working on. However, I am having some very specific problems. First, the literature I have discovered on Groebner basis calculations are either extremely advanced or sacrifice completeness for simplicity. Secondly, to come to grips with these methods I have tried working with computer algebra systems (specifically Macaulay 2, version 1.2) to wade through examples. Therein, my problem has a similar flavor to this post (I found the answers moderately helpful). One of the answers to this question provides an example of a computation that works out correctly - I cannot get Macaulay to behave the same way on a randomly selected toy problem. It is my understanding that Groebner basis methods are an infallible way to find solutions to nonlinear systems of equations over any field (barring some issues with numerical stability and computational complexity). That is, it is my understanding that Groebner basis computations will always reduce a system of equations to an equivalent system in which there exist polynomials of one variable (and that solving the system can proceed from finding roots to this one polynomial and then ""steamroll"" the rest). I believe I have followed the steps necessary to get a system of nonlinear equations into its Groebner basis form. However, I do not see a clear means of finding solutions to my system. Here is my Macaulay 2 history. i29 : T = ZZ[f,g,h] o29 = T o29 : PolynomialRing i32 : Woot = gb ideal(f^2*g + g^2*h +

               $g^2h^5+2g^2h^4+4g*h^5+4h^6$ None of these are univariate. (This particular system of equations is not important to me - I just used them as an example). Have I chosen a bad monomial ordering? (Is it possible to compute an ""unhelpful"" Goebner basis if you have a bad monomial ordering?) Have I run the wrong commands through Macaulay? Is my understanding of Groebner basis misinformed? How would I solve this system of equations with Groebner basis reduction?","['algebraic-geometry', 'macaulay2', 'computer-science', 'groebner-basis', 'computer-algebra-systems']"
18844,Stability of a generalized form of the Mathieu equation,"I am using the Mathieu equation $$x''(t) + a x(t) + 2 q \cos(2 t) x(t) = 0,$$
as a model of a physical system. The conditions on the parameters $a$ and $q$ for stable solutions to exist are well known and are even implemented as built-in functions in systems such as Mathematica. Now, I would like to extend my model to the form 
  $$x''(t) + c x^2(t)+ a x(t) + 2 q \cos(2 t) x(t) = 0,$$
and establish the stability criteria for this modified model. Is this a known model, or can it be transformed to one? Does it even make sense to talk about stability conditions for this case -- as far as I can see Floquet's theorem does not apply? Although the most general form would be most interesting, it would also be interesting to know the stability criteria for the less general case of $a=0$.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
18853,"What is $\{f(u,v)\in \mathbb{Q}[u^{\pm},v^{\pm}]:f(ht,kt)\in \mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm},1/h,1/k]\forall h,k\in \mathbb{Z}\backslash\{0\}\}$?","I'm not much good at even basic number theory, so this is really mysterious to me.  I think the actual question might want to restrict to finite Laurent series, but I don't think it matters: I'm pretty sure what I want to do is figure out what each homogeneous component is allowed to look like.  Moreover, I'm pretty sure that by plugging in $h=k=1$ I get that all the coefficients in nonnegative degrees need to be integral, so the first place to look is in degree $-1$. So suppose we have \begin{equation*} f(u,v)_{-1}=\frac{a_1}{a_2 u}+\frac{b_1}{b_2 v}. \end{equation*}  Then \begin{equation*}f(ht,kt)_{-1}=\frac{a_1}{a_2 ht}+\frac{b_1}{b_2 kt} = \frac{a_1 b_2 k+b_1 a_2 h}{a_2b_2hkt};\end{equation*} for this to lie in $\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm},1/h,1/k]$ we need $a_2b_2|a_1b_2k+b_1a_2 h$.  I believe it's a basic fact that since this has to be true for all nonzero $h$ and $k$, we need that $a_2b_2|gcd(a_1b_2,b_1a_2)$.  This implies that $a_2b_2|a_1b_2 \Rightarrow a_2|a_1$ and similarly $b_2|b_1$.  But assuming we started with our fractions in reduced form, this implies that $a_2=b_2=1$; that is, $f(u,v)_{-1}\in \mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm}]$. Since I don't think I gained much insight from that calculation, I just tried to find restrictions on \begin{equation*} f(u,v)_{-2}=\frac{a_1}{a_2u^2}+\frac{b_1}{b_2uv}+\frac{c_1}{c_2v^2}. \end{equation*}  Now we have \begin{equation*} f(ht,kt)_{-2} = \frac{a_1}{a_2 h^2t^2}+\frac{b_1}{b_2 hkt^2} + \frac{c_1}{c_2 k^2t^2} \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} = \frac{a_1b_2hkc_2k^2 + b_1a_2h^2c_2k^2 + c_1a_2h^2 b_2hk}{a_2b_2c_2h^3k^3t^2} \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} = \frac{a_1b_2c_2k^2 + b_1a_2c_2hk + c_1a_2b_2h^2}{a_2b_2c_2h^2k^2t^2},\end{equation*} and what we need is for $a_2b_2c_2|a_1b_2c_2k^2+b_1a_2c_2hk+c_1a_2b_2h^2$ (for all $h$ and $k$, of course).  This is where I'm stuck.  Reducing mod $a_2$ and recalling that $gcd(a_1,a_2)=1$ we should get that $a_2|b_2c_2k^2$, and similarly $b_2|a_2c_2hk$ and $c_2|a_2b_2h^2$.  Putting $h=k=1$ this means that $a_2|b_2c_2$, $b_2|a_2c_2$, and $c_2|a_2b_2$.  I tried breaking down these conditions into conditions on the prime factorizations but didn't get very far.  And in any case, numbers that satisfy these need not satisfy the original relation.  Help please???? Motivation: In case you're still reading and you're wondering why I care about this specific calculation, it's because it's closely related to the ""$K$-theoretic homology of $K$-theory""; precisely, it's the image of $K_*K\rightarrow K_*K\otimes \mathbb{Q}$.  This is important because for any (co)homology theory $E$, the $E$-cohomology of $E$ (written $E^*E$) is exactly the algebra of stable cohomology operations, and with some additional assumtions on $E$ (which are satisfied by $K$-theory), the $E$-homology of $E$ is the coalgebra of stable homology cooperations.  Furthermore, the $e$-invariant is a homomorphism from the stable homotopy groups of spheres to a subquotient of $K_*K$!","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'number-theory']"

We already have Direct Product , Semi-direct products, so after all why do we need Tensor Product? The Definition of Tensor Product at Planet Math is confusing. Definition: Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $A,
B$ be $R$-modules. There exists an $R$-module $A\otimes B$, called the tensor product of $A$ and $B$ over $R$, together with a canonical
bilinear homomorphism

property.

$$\tilde{\phi}: A\otimes B\rightarrow C,$$
such that
$$\phi(a,b) = \tilde{\phi}(a\otimes b)$$
for all $a\in A,\; b\in B.$ The tensor product $A\otimes B$ can be constructed by taking the free
$R$-module generated by all formal symbols
$$a\otimes b,\quad a\in A,\;b\in B,$$
and quotienting by the obvious bilinear relations:
\begin{align*}
 (a_1+a_2)\otimes b &= a_1\otimes b + a_2\otimes b,\quad &&a_1,a_2\in
 A,\; b\in B \\
 a\otimes(b_1+b_2) &= a\otimes b_1 + a\otimes b_2,\quad &&a\in A,\;b_1,b_2\in

18932,Why is cofiniteness included in the definition of direct sum of submodules?,"In contrast to the possibility of taking  an arbitrary sequence of elements of submodules in the definition of direct product, the definition for the direct sum of submodules of a module requires the indexed elements to vanish cofinitely(i.e. except finitely many times). More precisely, Let $R$ be a ring, and $\{M_i : i ∈ I\}$ a family of left $R-$modules indexed by the set $I$. The direct sum of ${M_i}$ is then defined to be the set of all sequences $(α_i)$ where $\alpha_i \in M_i$ and $α_i = 0$ for cofinitely many indices $i$. (The direct product is analogous but the indices do not need to cofinitely vanish.)(Source Wikipedia: Direct sum of modules .)We have similar definition for the sum of submodules.

Is there a closed-form solution for any other values of $\theta$? Update: The general closed-form solution is given in the answer below.  In terms of the notation in the question, it is

F(\theta) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} (-1)^{k-1} {N\choose k} \left(1 - \frac{k \theta}{2\pi}\right)^{N-1},

Person B: But is it not also the case that one may find at least one rational between any two irrationals and vice versa? Person A: That seems logical, I can't pose a counterexample... but why does that matter? Person B: Wouldn't that imply that for every irrational there is a corresponding rational?  And from this the Reals would be equivalent to 2 elements for every element of the rationals?

(X,Y,f) = (X,Y,(X,Y,F)).
I've come across notation that specifies (X,Y,f) as ((X,Y),f). Here, page 35 of this .pdf file So ((X,Y),f) = ((X,Y),((X,Y),F)) would seem to make sense. Bourbaki calls f a set & F it's graph but the notation in the .pdf file says
that f would be defined in the way I've explained above, i.e. that F is a
subset of XxY. The thing is that since a function f is itself a relation
shouldn't it be a relation in a set, i.e. ((X,Y),f)? Assuming that the above is the way to think about these things, how
would I think of both F & f? In f = (X,Y,F), F ⊆ (X x Y) so (x,y) ∈ F or xFy,
where obviously (x∈X) & (y∈Y). How about f? I think f ⊆ (X x Y) so (x,y) ∈ f or xfy. I don't understand how this makes sense because for the set f = (X,Y,F)
Bourbaki writes f : X → Y so for (X,Y,f) I'd have to set g = (X,Y,f) and
write g : X → Y. This is a weird conclusion but it seems to suggest itself. The problem of being extremely clear about what sets you are using is
particularly interesting when doing linear algebra. The use of set-theoretic notation in linear algebra both clarifies things for
me and brings up similar questions, for a vector space V I could write
((V,+),(F,+',°),•) with the clarification that: in (V,+) we have + : V × V → V, in (F,+',°) we have (+' : F × F → F) & ( ° : F × F → F). In • we have (• : F × V → V) or perhaps [• : (V,+) × (F,+',°) → (V,+)]? This notation clearly illustrates why the two operations, vector addition
and scalar multiplication are used on a vector space and the axioms for
each clearly jump out, i.e. (V,+) is abelian, (F,+',°) is a field and • isn't the
clearest to me but I think it's similar to the way that + & ° are related in a
field, i.e. ""multiplication distributes over addition"". Relating all of this to the concerns I had above in a clear manner, in the
set (F,+',°) it would make sense that +' is a set of the form (F,+'') where
+'' is a subset of the cartesian product of F x F. Similarly with °, and in the
set (V,+) you'd have something similar, also in • you'd have a crazy set
((V,+), (F,+',°), •') or including even more brackets (((V,+), (F,+',°)), •')
with •' being a subset of the cartesian product of (V,+) & (F,+',°). There is another problem when you want to give a vector space a norm,
would I write ((V,+),(F,+',°),•,⊗) where ⊗ : V x V → F ? Would ⊗ itself
suggest the subset ((V,+), (F,+',°), ⊗') in the manner explained above?
I don't think so because ⊗' would be the set of ordered pairs (x,a) with
x ∈ V and a ∈ F but since V x V → F you've got the map (x,x') ↦ a, it's
quite confusing tbh and need help with this. All this seems crazy but it also makes a lot of sense, I want to be very
rigorous about what I'm doing and all of the above seems to suggest itself
but it could be a lot of nonsense caused by simple confusion of a particular
issue in the post , I'm thinking that (X,Y,F) implying (X,Y,f) is the
culprit but again this idea clarifies things. If you read to this point thanks
so much, hopefully you recognise the issue.",['elementary-set-theory']

Suppose $f(X)=a_{0}+a_{1}X+\cdots +a_{n}X^{n}$ is such that $a_{0}$ is a unit in $R$ and $a_{1},a_{2}, \dots,a_{r}$ are all nilpotent in $R$. Since $R$ is commutative, we get that $a_{1}X,a_{2}X^{2},\cdots,a_{n}X^{n}$ are all nilpotent and hence also their sum is nilpotent. Let $z = \sum a_{i}X^{i}$ then $a_{0}^{-1}z$ is nilpotent and so $1+a_{0}^{-1}z$ is a unit. Thus $f(X)=a_{0}+z=a_{0} \cdot (1+a_{0}^{-1}z)$ is a unit since product of two units in $R[X]$ is a unit.

I assume this statement is correct, but unfortunately I can't come up with a proper proof.

First part: Fix $z_0\in D$. We define $F(z)=\int_\sigma f(\zeta)d\zeta$ where $\sigma$ is the path joining $z_0$ with $z$ by taking an horizontal line from $z_0$ and getting to $z$ with a vertical line (hope it is clear). ""It is immediately seen that $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}(z)=if(z)$"". Not for me. I mean, I'm geometrically and intuitively inclined to understand that when we derive vertically, since it is a constant path what we should get is the value of $f$. I don't see how the $i$ appears, though, and I formally don't understand what's going on. First of all, what does $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$ mean? This is what I understand by that: if $F=u+iv$ then $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + i \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$. Right? I also found the following formula scribbled on my notebook:
$\int_\gamma f(z)dz = \int_\gamma f(z) dx + i \int_\gamma f(z) dy$. Is this correct? I don't see how it makes sense to integrate with respect to $x$ a complex-valued function: what am I supposed to do with the $y$'s in the integrand? I'm guessing some abuse of notation is going on here. Anyway, I'm guessing this is something easy and I'm just confused by notation. Second part: we get that $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}(z)=if(z)$ and $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(z)=f(z)$. ""Hence $F$ is holomorphic with derivative $f$"". How is that? I mean, we have $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}= -i \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$, which does not seem like Cauchy-Riemann to me. I'm guessing this is the same confusion as above.

Hartshorne does appear to have the phrase in a few instances, but certainly does not give any definition at all similar to the one above, and besides Hartshorne is above my level right now so I am not in a good position to decide whether his usage agrees with that above or not. The above theorem appears to me to exist only in Shafarevich and nowhere else in the mathematical literature. Wikipedia offers the following much simpler characterization: ""In the geometry of complex algebraic curves, a local parameter for a curve $C$ at a smooth point $P$ is just a meromorphic function on $C$ that has a simple zero at $P$."" So my question is this: what exactly are these local parameters, and how should I think of them? How can I reconcile what Wikipedia has written with what Shafarevich writes? The name ""local parameter"" suggests to me there is some simple characterization of these functions which Shafarevich is keeping a mystery from me (or is Shafarevich's definition more intuitive than I am finding it?). And finally are these really present virtually nowhere in the entire mathematical literature except Shafarevich, or do equivalent ideas go under different names?","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"
19315,Global Sections of Sheaf and Dual,"Maybe this is well-known, but suppose you have an invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ on a scheme $X$. If $X$ is a projective space (or even projective bundle over an integral scheme, by a similar argument...I think), then if $H^0(X, \mathcal{L})\neq 0$ and $H^0(X, \mathcal{L}^\vee)\neq 0$ we get that $\mathcal{L}\simeq \mathcal{O}_X$. This is really simple because $\mathcal{L}\simeq \mathcal{O}_X(n)$, so you get that the two hypothesis mean $n\geq 0$ and $n\leq 0$, so $n=0$. My guess is this must be true more generally. Are there conditions on $X$ such that any invertible sheaf with the property that having non-trivial global sections of both it and its dual implies it is trivial?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

19334,"In neutral geometry, can a family of parallel lines leave holes in the plane?","In neutral plane geometry, Euclidean geometry without the parallel postulate, I want to show that the family of parallel lines all perpendicular to a given line pass through all of the plane, leaving no holes. My present formulation of this idea is as follows: Given two lines $l$ and $m$ and a transversal $t$ perpendicular to $l$ at point $A$ and passing through line $m$ at $B$, and given another point $C$ on line $m$ forming a triangle $\triangle ABC$. Then there exists a line $n$ perpendicular to $l$ (and therefore parallel to $t$) which passes through the interior of side $\overline{AC}$ (and therefore the interior of the triangle). This claim is easy to show in Euclidean geometry where all parallel lines are equidistant. In neutral geometry, parallel lines may bend away from each other, and this claim is much less obvious. Since it appears to be true in models of hyperbolic geometry, I'm guessing it is true in neutral geometry, but I'm at a loss for how to show it. Update: It occurs to me that this question seems a bit more esoteric than it really is. So let me point out that neutral geometry is really very familiar territory for many of you. As I mentioned it is just ordinary Euclidean geometry without the axiom that asserts the uniqueness of a line parallel to a given line and through a given point and any consequences that follow from that. So the usual suspects (theorems) are present: Isosceles triangle theorems, SAS, ASA, SSS, AAS. The exterior angle theorem, triangle inequality, scalene inequality, hinge theorem. Actually, many parallel line theorems hold, namely. those that say things like ""If two lines are cut with a transversal are pair of congruent angles, then the lines are parallel."" or "" If two line share a common perpendicular, then they are parallel."" What is not true are theorems that assert the converse: ""If two lines are parallel, then ..."" and also not true ""If lines $l$ and $m$ are parallel and lines $m$ and $n$ are parallel, then $l$ and $n$ are parallel,"" and that parallel lines are equidistant (but equidistant lines are parallel). Others theorems that are missing include: The Pythagorean theorem The angle sum theorem (instead the sum of the angles in a triangle must be 180 or less) Rectangles may not exist. And the weird one: there may be no such thing as similarity. Update: To make the answer below understandable, you need (also in the comments but hidden): Proof that two lines perpendicular to a given line are parallel: If they were not parallel, they would intersect forming a isosceles triangle with two 90 degree angles. the complimentary angle to either angle would also be 90 degrees. But by the exterior angle theorem, that exterior angle must be strictly greater than 90 degrees, which is a contradiction.","['geometry', 'euclidean-geometry']"

This question yielded two different proofs from my professors, which managed to get conflicting results (true and false). Could you please weigh in and explain what's happening, and offer a working proof? Proof that it is invertible: Consider matrix $A-I_{n}$. Multiplying $(A+I_{n})$ by $(A-I_{n})$
we get $A^2-AI_{n}+AI_{n}-I^2_{n}$. This simplifies to $A^2-I^2_{n}$ which is equal to $-I_{n}$, since $A^2=0$. So, the professor argued, since we have shown that there exists a $B$ such that $(A+I_{n})$ times $B$ is equal to $I$, $(A+I_{n})$ must be invertible. I am afraid, though, that she forgot about the negative sign that was leftover in front of the $I$ -- from what I understand, $(A+I_{n})$*$(A-I_{n})$=$-I$ does not mean that $(A+I_{n})$ is invertible. Proof that it is not invertible: Assume that $A(x)=0$ has a non-trivial solution. Now, given $(A+I_{n})(x)=\vec{0}$, multiply both sides by $A$. We get $A(A+I_{n})(x)=A(\vec{0})$, which can be written as $(A^2+A)(x)=\vec{0}$, which simplifies to $A(x)=0$, as $A^2=0$. Since we assumed that $A(x)=0$ has a non-trivial solution, we just demonstrated that $(A+I_{n})$ has a non-trivial solution, too. Hence, it is not invertible. I am not sure if I reproduced the second proof in complete accuracy (I think I did), but the idea was to show that if $A(x)=\vec{0}$ has a non-trivial solution, $A(A+I_{n})$ does too, rendering $A(A+I_{n})$ non-invertible. But regardless of the proofs, I can think of examples that show that at least in some cases, the statement is true; consider matrices $\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0\\

aa = b \\
aa + 0 = b + 0
$$
We know $a \cdot 0 = 0$ so we can substitute for zero
$$
 aa + a \cdot 0 = b
$$
Using the additive inverse of $aa$ we get:
$$
 (aa) + (-aa) + a \cdot 0 = b + (-aa) \\
 a \cdot 0 = b + (-aa)
$$
I’m still not getting the concept of how to prove things, maybe a little insight into what are possible steps to approach problems like these. Thats as far as I got, any help is appreciated.","['finite-fields', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
19630,What is an intermediate definition for a tangent to a curve?,"Most students come to calculus with an intuitive sense of what a tangent line should be for a curve. It is easy enough to give a definition of a tangent to a circle that is both elementary and rigorous. (A line that intersects a circle exactly once.) Yet, when we talk about a curve, such as a polynomial, I think one must talk about infinity to give a rigorous definition. This is not a bad thing... It can help motivate a lesson on the formal definition of a tangent line at a point... But, what intermediate definition could I use to help those students who have no intuition about the matter get an idea of what we are going for before we talk about secants and such? I have looked at some textbooks and online and I find saying a tangent line is one that ""just touches"" problematic-- it is the kind of phrase that is quite meaningless... Even in the setting of un-rigorous definitions. Yes, I will give examples, but I would like to do better ... I think saying that a tangent line is an arrow that points in the direction that the curve is going at that instant might make sense... Though it makes everything 'directional' and that might confuse them later. What is the best intermediate definition you have seen?","['education', 'calculus']"
19672,On the Möbius $\mu$ function,"A search on wikipedia shows:
$$\mu(n) = \sum_{k=1,gcd(k,n)=1}^{n} e^{2\pi i \frac{k}{n}}$$
But that uses complex numbers... and requires finding out the gcd... How useful will be a method, if that could find the exact value for $\mu(n)$ function, by just knowing all the values from $\mu(1)$ till $\mu(n-1)$, which does not require factoring any integer and which uses only elementary methods? Has this been done before? My question is more precisely: Does any such formula exist?","['soft-question', 'number-theory']"
