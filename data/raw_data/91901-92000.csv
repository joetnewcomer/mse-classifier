1247197,A different way to show that $a^k-1 \mid a^n-1$ if $k\mid n$?,"A student that I'm tutoring showed me the following problem: Let $a\gt 1,$ and $k,n\gt 0.$ Prove that $a^k-1\mid a^n-1$ if and only if $k\mid n$ . Solution: Since $k$ divides $n$ , we have $n=ks$ for some integer $s$ . $a^n-1=a^{ks}-1=(a^k)^s-1=(a^k-1)((a^k)^{s-1}+(a^k)^{s-2}+\dots+(a^k)^2+a^k+1)$ .  Thus, $a^k-1$ divides $a^n-1$ . Now suppose that $a^k-1$ divides $a^n-1$ .  Let $n=ks+r$ where $r\ (0\le r\le k-1)$ is a remainder when we divide $n$ by $k$ . $a^n-1=a^{ks}a^r-1=((a^k)^s-1)a^r+(a^r-1)$ .  By the argument above, $a^k-1$ divides $a^{ks}-1.$ Thus, $a^k-1$ must divide $a^r-1$ .  Since $r\lt k,$ we have $r=0.$ He wanted to see another way to prove the converse and I got stumped!

1247290,How can we prove that a three legged chair will never be wobbly?,"I am taking the geometry approach. We know from intuition that more than three legs on a chair will make it unstable if any of the legs have a different length than the others. So by ""wobble"" I mean the possibility that at least one of the legs will be in the air when one or more legs are made shorter/longer than others. Also, the ""surface"" must be perfectly flat. A three legged chair is unaffected by any amount of change we make to its legs. So to prove this I started out connecting lines between each legs (diagonals). So far I haven't made any progress.

1247613,What the curvature $2$-form really represents?,"Let $(E,\pi,B)$ be a principal bundle with structure group $G$. The connection $1$-form can be thought of as a projection on the vertical part. It allows us to characterize the horizontal subspaces as $H_p E = \ker \omega_p$ then. Apart from that, there's the curvature $2$-form. This object is defined as follows: let $\operatorname{hor}$ mean the projection operator taking a vector field to its horizontal part. Then, if $\eta$ is a $k$-form on $E$ its exterior covariant derivative is the $k+1$ form $D\eta$ defined by $$D\eta(X_1,\dots,X_{k+1}) = d\eta(\operatorname{hor}X_1,\dots,\operatorname{hor}X_{k+1}).$$ We call the curvature $2$-form then the differential form $\Omega = D\omega$ where $\omega$ is the connection $1$-form. Although the definition is perfectly clear I can't understand what this object really represents. I mean, when we define curvature for curves on space, the curvature is meant to represent how much the curve deviates from a straight line. On the other hand, when reading books about General Relativity some time ago, I read that the curvature of the Levi-Civita connection is intended to encode the information of the difference between a paralel transported vector around a loop and the starting vector. Those two ideas are more geometric. This curvature $2$-form, on the other hand, I can't understand what it really represents. So, what the curvature $2$-form really represents? How it relates to those other ideas of curvature? And how this intuition is captured by the rigorous definition?","['principal-bundles', 'curvature', 'fiber-bundles', 'differential-geometry', 'intuition']"
1247632,Trigonometrical functions and complex numbers,"(This question will at first appear too broad. However, the overall philosophy will be explained below in a way that asks specific questions, which I hope will be conducive to this being a reasonable question.) I have often wondered to what extent the trigonometrical functions' properties can be proven using only real results (they're real functions, so why would we need complex numbers. The precise formulation of my initial question is Are there any real trigonometrical identities that require complex-number results to prove? So, for example, the double-angle formulae can be proven using geometry or matrices, and I think most people would prefer this to the way using complex exponentials, simply because you can do it before introducing complex numbers. On the other hand, de Moivre's theorem,
$$ (\cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta})^{\alpha} = \cos{\alpha\theta}+i\sin{\alpha\theta}, $$
is excluded because, obviously, it has an $i$ in it. Similarly Euler's formula, and hence the complex expressions of cosine and sine. At first, I thought that the sum
$$ 1+2\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} r^n \cos{n\theta} = \frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\cos{\theta}+r^2} \quad (|r|<1) $$
could only be done with complex numbers, but (after mucking about with the complex exponentials) one finds the quantity
$$ C_m =\frac{2r^{m+1}(r\cos{m\theta}-\cos{(m+1)\theta})}{1-2r\cos{\theta}+r^2}, $$
which satisfies
$$ C_m-C_{m-1} = 2r^m \cos{m\theta}, $$
and therefore the partial sums are given by
$$ 1+2\sum_{n=0}^{m} r^n \cos{n\theta} = 1+C_m-C_0, $$
and
$$ 1-C_0 = 1-\frac{2r(r-\cos{\theta})}{1-2r\cos{\theta}+r^2} = \frac{1-r^2}{1+2r\cos{\theta}+r^2}. $$
Since $C_m \to 0$ as $r \to \infty$, we find the answer we were hoping for. Similarly with the product
$$ \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \sin{\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right)} = \frac{n}{2^{n-1}}, $$
which can be proved using ingenious use of the factor theorem. (This proof I found on a rather obscure forum somewhere in the depths of the Internet. I'll reproduce it if people are interested) So, the questions, as I see them, are Is there a counterexample to the claim that any real trigonometric identity can be proven using only real number techniques? Is there a general way of proving that no counterexample exists (obviously a long shot, but you never know if there's something like an obscure Galois theory calculation out there...) If either of those is too general for you, can anyone prove that
$$ \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} (1-2r\cos{\left( \frac{k\pi}{n} \right)}+r^2) = \frac{1-r^{2n}}{1-r^2} $$
without using complex numbers (the usual proof uses roots of unity, for fairly obvious reasons). (If you're wondering where these product formulae come from, G.H. Hardy, for reasons best known to himself, considered the integrals
$$ \int_0^{\pi} \log{\sin{\theta}} \, d\theta \qquad \int_0^{\pi} \log{(1-2r\cos{\theta}+r^2)} \, d\theta $$
as among those that should be evaluated by first principles, which leads fairly directly to considering the above products.)

1247639,Understanding quotient map,"If I am understanding correctly, a quotient map can be defined in this way (actually I quoted the following from Munkres): Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces; let $p:X \rightarrow Y$ be a surjective map.

The map $p:X \rightarrow X/C$ s.t. $p(x)=[x]$ ($x \in X, [x]$ is an equivalence class) is defined to be a quotient map . I understood the concept from the second one, since equivalence classes partition a set, which is very easy to visualize. (Can anyone answer this ?)

1247782,Finding the Limit of the Ratio of a Recursive Sequence's Terms,"Let {$f_n$} be defined recursively as $f_1 = f_2 = f_3 = 1$ and $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-3}$ for all $n \gt 3$. Also, define {$a_n$} as the ratio of the terms of {$f_n$}. That is, $a_n = \frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n}$ for some $n \geq 1$. So, the terms of {$f_n$} are $$f_1 = 1,f_2 = 1,f_3 = 1,f_4 = 2,f_5 = 3,f_6 = 4,f_7 = 6,\ldots,$$ and the terms of {$a_n$} are $$a_1 = 1,a_2 = 1,a_3 = 2,a_4 = \frac{3}{2},a_5 = \frac{4}{3},a_6 = \frac{6}{4},\ldots$$ The question then becomes evaluating the limiting ratio of {$f_n$} or, in other words, Find $$\lim_{n \to \infty}{a_n} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n}, \forall n \geq 1.$$ The way I approached this problem was to try to put bounds on $a_k = \frac{f_{k+1}}{f_k}$ for some $k$. It made the most sense to me that $1 \leq a_k \leq 2$ just based off of the first few terms of {$a_n$}. Then, I tried to rewrite $a_k = \frac{f_{k+1}}{f_k}$ in some way that would allow me to put bounds on $a_{k+1}$, since we want to show next that $1 \leq a_{k+1} \leq 2$. $$a_{k+1} = \frac{f_{k+2}}{f_{k+1}} = \frac{f_{k+1} + f_{k-1}}{f_{k+1}} = 1 + \frac{f_{k-1}}{f_{k+1}}.$$ Next, I thought it would be a good idea to invert the inequality $1 \leq a_k \leq 2$. That is, $1 \geq \frac{1}{a_k} = \frac{f_k}{f_{k+1}} \geq \frac{1}{2}$ and then add $1$ to get the inequality $2\geq 1 + \frac{f_k}{f_{k+1}} \geq \frac{3}{2}$. And while $1 + \frac{f_k}{f_{k+1}}$ looks like a pretty result, what I actually need to find in this case is $1 + \frac{f_{k-1}}{f_{k+1}}$. It seems that at this point more clever manipulation is required, but I don't know what else can be done once I've reached this dead end. Can someone please elaborate on how to proceed with the above method or provide an alternative approach altogether? I appreciate any and all advice!

1247872,Convergence in some measure implies convergence in some other measure absolutely continuous to the first,"Suppose that $f_n$ converges to $f$ in measure $\mu$ and $\nu$ is a different measure absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$ (which of course means that both $\mu$ and $\nu$ are defined on the same measure space and  $\mu(E)=0\Longrightarrow \nu(E)=0$ for all sets $E$ in the sigma field). Then I'm trying to prove that $f_n$ converges to $f$ in $\nu$ also. I think a proof using the Radon-Nikodym theorem may exist, but I tried doing this from the first principles. So I argued that since $f_n$ converges to $f$ in $\mu$, it has a subsequence $f_{n_k}$ that converges to $f$ almost everywhere w.r.t $\mu$ and hence also w.r.t $\nu$ as $\nu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$. So if I assume that all measures are finite, then convergence of $f_{n_k}$ almost everywhere w.r.t $\nu$ implies convergence of $f_{n_k}$ to $f$ in measure $\nu$. I can't finish the argument after this. Can a proof on these lines be completed? Also in hindsight, I assumed finiteness of all involved measures, so a general question is whether it works for $\sigma-$finite measures. I think not, but would a appreciate a counterexample.",['measure-theory']

1247921,Enumerating Bianchi circles,"Background: Katherine Stange describes Schmidt arrangements in ""Visualising the arithmetic of imaginary quadratic fields"", arXiv:1410.0417 . Given an imaginary quadratic field $K$, we study the Bianchi group $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathcal{O}_K)$, which is the group of Möbius transformations with coefficients in the ring of integers of $K$. The image of $\mathbb R$ under a group element is called a $K$-Bianchi circle, and the set of $K$-Bianchi circles is called a Schmidt arrangement. Here's an example from Stange's image gallery , taking $K=\mathbb Q(\sqrt{-7})$ and drawing all circles with curvature up to $30\sqrt 7$ that intersect the fundamental domain of $\mathcal{O}_K$: My question: How can I recreate such images for arbitrary $K$, starting from rational integer arithmetic? What algorithms would I need to write C++ code from scratch to enumerate a Schmidt arrangement? (I prefer not to pull a Sage package off the shelf.) It's a straightforward task to implement the basic arithmetic operations of $K$, $\mathcal{O}_K$, and $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathcal{O}_K)$. Then, a brute-force approach is to generate lots of matrices in $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathcal{O}_K)$, check if each has determinant $1$, and if so, draw the appropriate circle. There are many problems with this brute-force approach: It wastes most of its time inspecting matrices without determinant $1$, especially as we search for large-norm coefficients and high-curvature circles. It also wastes time on circles that are outside the bounds of the illustration. It revisits many group elements that generate the same circle. We should quotient out the stabilizer of $\mathbb R$, namely the modular group $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. It's unclear how many matrices need to be tested before we can say that we've enumerated all the circles in a diagram like Stange's. Whenever I reach for a more clever approach, I'm slowed down by the fact that $\mathcal{O}_K$ isn't necessarily a unique factorization domain, and even when it is, it isn't necessarily Euclidean. How can we enumerate something like $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathcal{O}_K)$ with reasonable efficiency when $K$ is so unruly? Edit: To explain my last remark, we're looking for matrices $\pmatrix{a&b\\c&d}$ with coefficients in $\mathcal{O}_K$ where $ad-bc=1$. Each row and column of such a matrix consists of two coprime numbers. How does one enumerate pairs of coprime numbers in a non-Euclidean ring?

Let us define the support of this function as the complement of the union of all open subsets of $I^2$ with C-measure zero.  Based on my understanding of the textbook I am reading (Nelsen's An Introduction to Copulas ), the C-measure can be defined as $$ V_C(B) = C(u_2,v_2)-C(u_2,v_1)-C(u_1,v_2)+C(u_1,v_1) $$
I suspect that C-measure is a copula analogy to H-measure in probability distribution theory. My questions are: For a 2-dimensional distribution function H(x,y), is the H-measure the same thing as the H-volume, which is different than: $V_H(B) = H(x_2,y_2)-H(x_2,y_1)-H(x_1,y_2)+H(x_1,y_1)$? Why is the support defined this way?  Why don't we just define it as the domain where $C(u,v)$ is not 0?  Does this make assumptions on the continuity of $C$? Does this exclude distributions which may be continuous in some intervals and have point masses in others? Loosely, an open set is a set with no boundaries.  I can't seem to make the connection between this definition and open subsets of $I^2$.  Would it be correct to say that an open subset of $I^2$ is $(0.3,0.4)$, and another open subset of $I^2$ is $(0,1)$?

  $$g(x)\mid f(x)$$ I think this problem is not very easy unless I specify $K$ to be $\mathbb C$. If in $\mathbb C$, then it is plain to see 
$$g(x)=(x-\omega_1)(x-\omega_2)$$
where $\omega_{1}=e^{i2\pi/3}$ and $\omega_{2}=e^{-i2\pi/3}$. And it's also obvious after simple calculation, that
$$f(\omega_1)=f(\omega_2)=0$$

$$(x-\omega_1)(x-\omega_2)\mid f(x)$$
i.e.
$$g(x)\mid f(x)$$ Nevertheless , all I have done so far is based on the assumption that $K$ is (or includes) $\mathbb C$, without which I think it will be ridiculous to write something like $(x-\omega_{1,2})$ as polynomials.

And I think $g(x)\mid f(x)$ always holds whatever $K$ be, even though the factorization is not always true. So am I wrong in not giving up my proof?

Then the following are logically equivalent $Y$ is metric $Y$ is first countable for all $p\in Y$, $\operatorname{fr}(f^{-1}(p))$ is compact One side is pretty easy, since the range is a Hausdorff space, in particular the points are closed then $f^{-1}(p)$ is closed in $X$, but for the other I have serious problems. Suppose  $F$ is a closed set in $X$ and $X$ is an A-space, then by the Hanai-Morita theorem we know that for any map satisfying (*) we have $\forall p\in Y$ the frontier of the preimage of $p$ is a compact. Suppose to the contrary that $\operatorname{fr} (F)$ is not compact in $X$, then there is a sequence $\{x_n: n\in {\bf {N}}\}\subset \operatorname{fr}(F)$ having no cluster points in the frontier of $F$... I was trying to repeat the proof of the Morita's theorem but I can't I really appreciate any help.","['metric-spaces', 'general-topology']"
1249107,How to Find the Function of a Given Power Series?,"(Please see edit below; I originally asked how to find a power series expansion of a given function, but I now wanted to know how to do the reverse case.) Can someone please explain how to find the power series expansion of the function in the title? Also, how would you do it in the reverse case? That is, given the power series expansion, how can you deduce the function $\frac{x}{1-x-x^3}$? I've also rewritten the function as $$\frac{x}{1-x-x^3} = x \cdot \frac{1}{1-x(1-x^2)}$$ which is of the form of the Maclaurin series $\frac{1}{1-x} = 1+x+x^2+x^3+\ldots$ So the series expansion would then be $$x \cdot (1+(x-x^3)+(x-x^3)^2+(x-x^3)^3+\ldots)$$ However, expanding this to find the simplified power series expansion becomes complicated. According to WolframAlpha (link: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=power+series+of+x%2F%281-x-x%5E3%29 ) it eventually works out to $$x+x^2+x^3+2x^4+3x^5+4x^6+6x^7+9x^8+13x^9+19x^{10} +\ldots$$ which is a function defined recursively by $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-3}$ for all $n\gt 3$ with the initial condition that $f_1=f_2=f_3=1$ Appreciate any and all help! Thanks for reading, A Edit : I actually want to find the reverse of the original question. Given the recursively defined function (see above) $$x+x^2+x^3+2x^4+3x^5+4x^6+6x^7+9x^8+13x^9+19x^{10} +\ldots ,$$ how can I show that the function of this power series expansion is $\frac{x}{1-x-x^3}$?","['power-series', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"

1249143,$x^4 + 1$ reducible over $\mathbb{R}$... is this possible?,"I am seeing this on a homework and am wondering if this is a typo. I am aware that $x^4 + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ . I know the following: A polynomial being irreducible over some ring does not imply that it is irreducible over some superring. $x^4 + 1$ has no linear factors and if it has no linear factors, then it can only be factored into polynomials of degree 2, and for there to be no term $a_1x^1$ , the factor must be of the form $a_2x^2 + a_0$ , and this can be done in $\mathbb{C}$ but not in $\mathbb{R}$ .","['abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"
