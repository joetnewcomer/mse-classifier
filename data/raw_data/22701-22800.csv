194494,How come there is only one solution to $\sqrt{110-n} = n$,"Given:
$\sqrt{110-n} = n$ It follows that: $110 - n = n^2$ $n^2 + n - 110 = 0$ $(n + 11)(n - 10)=0$ If $n = 10$, $\sqrt{110 - 10} = \sqrt{100} = 10$, it checks out. If $n = -11$, $\sqrt{110 - (-11)} = \sqrt{121} = 11$, it doesn't However! I thought that $\sqrt{x}$ gives you two possible numbers, $+\sqrt{x}$ and $-\sqrt{x}$, so in the example above, $\sqrt{121} = -11$ is a valid root. Can someone explain what's going on here? Why aren't they both valid?",['algebra-precalculus']

194513,Exercise on finite intermediate extensions,"Let $E/K$ be a field extension, and let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be intermediate fields of finite degree over $K$. Prove that $[L_1L_2:K] = [L_1 : K][L_2 : K]$ implies $L_1\cap L_2 = K$. My thinking process so far: I've gotten that $K \subseteq L_1 \cap L_2$ because trivially both are intermediate fields over K. I want to show that $L_1 \cap L_2 \subseteq K$, or equivalently that any element of $L_1 \cap L_2$ is also an element of $K$. So I suppose there exists some element $x\in L_1 \cap L_2\setminus K$. Well then I know that this element is algebraic over $K$, implying that $L_1:K=[L_1:K(x)][K(x):K]$, and similarly for $L_2$, implying that that these multiplied together equal $L_1L_2:K$ by hypothesis.

194537,Does the sign of the characteristic polynomial have any meaning?,"The characteristic polynomial of a matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$, $p_A (\lambda) = \det(A-\lambda \cdot E)$ can be used to find the eigenvalues of the linear function $\varphi:\mathbb{C}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n, \varphi(x) := A \cdot x$, as the eigenvalues are the roots of $p_A(\lambda)$. So, for finding the eigenvalues, the sign of the characteristic polynomial isn't important. At the moment, this is to only application of the characteristic polynomial that I know. Do other applications of the characteristic polynomial exist, where the sign of it is important? Can I make any statements about the matrix $A$ when I know the sign of its characteristic polynomial?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'polynomials']"
194538,Showing that an Isometry on the Euclidean Plane fixing the origin is Linear,"Suppose $f$ is an isometric (i.e., distance preserving) function on $\mathbb{E}^2$ such that $f(0,0) = (0,0)$.  Then I want to show that $f$ is necessarily linear.  Now $f$ is linear iff $f$ is both additive and homogenous. The following is an attempted proof for the homogeneity of f (missing the last step); still more, I have no idea how to argue for the additivity of $f$. Any ideas? Let $x \in \mathbb{E}^2$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ We know that $\forall x \in \mathbb{E}^2$, $\Vert x - 0 \Vert = \Vert f(x) - f(0)\Vert = \Vert f(x) - 0 \Vert$ so that $\Vert x\Vert = \Vert f(x)\Vert$. From this we immediately have the following facts: $\Vert x \Vert = \Vert f(x) \Vert$ $\Vert \alpha x \Vert = \Vert f(\alpha x) \Vert$ We can then argue that since $\Vert \alpha x\Vert = |\alpha| \Vert x \Vert = |\alpha| \Vert f(x) \Vert = \Vert \alpha f(x) \Vert$, we also have that $\Vert f(\alpha x) \Vert = \Vert \alpha f(x)\Vert$. Finally, we have that $\Vert \alpha x - x \Vert = \Vert \alpha f(x) - f(x) \Vert$ iff $ \Vert (\alpha - 1)x \Vert = \Vert (\alpha - 1) f(x) \Vert$ iff $|\alpha - 1| \Vert x \Vert = |\alpha - 1| \Vert f(x) \Vert$ Since the last of these statements is in fact true, we now have $\Vert \alpha x - x \Vert = \Vert \alpha f(x) - f(x) \Vert$ as desired. Now at this point it seems like I have all of the facts required to assert that $f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x)$, but I can't figure out how to formally state why without illegally appealing to visual intuition.

194579,What is the origin of the determinant in linear algebra?,"We often learn in a standard linear algebra course that a determinant is a number associated with a square matrix. We can define the determinant also by saying that it is the sum of all the possible configurations picking an element from a matrix from different rows and different columns multiplied by (-1) or (1) according to the number inversions. But how is this notion of a 'determinant' derived? What is a determinant, actually? I searched up the history of the determinant and it looks like it predates matrices. How did the modern definition of a determinant come about? Why do we need to multiply some terms of the determinant sum by (-1) based on the number of inversions? I just can't understand the motivation that created determinants. We can define determinants, and see their properties, but I want to understand how they were defined and why they were defined to get a better idea of their important and application.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'math-history', 'determinant']"
194599,Continuous Brouwer's fixed point theorem via Stokes's theorem?,"Let $B$ denote the closed unit ball in $\mathbf{R}^n$. Brouwer's fixed point theorem states that every continuous map $f:B\to B$ has a fixed point. There is a simple proof using Stokes's theorem, at least for the special case in which $f$ is smooth, as presented on Wikipedia here . The page also states that this case contains the full generality of the theorem, because if $f:B\to B$ is continuous without fixed points then $\epsilon = \inf_{x\in B} |x-f(x)| > 0$, so we can just convolve (each component of) $f$ with a smooth bump $\psi:\mathbf{R}^n\to\mathbf{R}$ supported on $\epsilon B$ to get a smooth counterexample to the theorem. Unfortunately, as it stands the proof doesn't work, because the distance of $f(B)$ to $\partial B$ could well be zero, in which case $\tilde{f} = \psi\ast f$ might not satisfy $\tilde{f}(B)\subset B$. Does anybody see a resolution to this difficulty? EDIT, following Willy's answer. I've just realised that I was confused when I asked this question. $\tilde{f}(B)\subset B$ was never really an issue; the issue was rather that convolution isn't fully defined near the boundary. The most immediate interpretation is to extend $f:B\to B$ by $0$ to $\mathbf{R}^n\to B$, but then mollifying $f$ doesn't give you a uniformly nearby $\tilde{f}$. The interpretation that works is to extend $f:B\to B$ to any uniformly continuous $F:\mathbf{R}^n\to B$, such as $$F(x) = \begin{cases} f(x) & \text{if $|x|\leq 1$,}\\  f(x/|x|) & \text{if $|x|\geq 1$,}\end{cases}$$ and then mollify.","['fixed-point-theorems', 'analysis']"

  Explain your reasoning. We can list the propositions as follows: $p$: ""Carlos did it"" $q$: ""I did not do it"" $r$: ""Diana did it"" $s$: ""Carlos lied when he said Diana did it"" It becomes reasonable to assume, then, that $p \rightarrow \neg r$, $p \rightarrow q$, and $r \oplus s$.

If I understood well a derivation is a way to extract the main properties of a differential operator: linearity and obeying the product rule. This line of thought leads me to a doubt: every differential operator should obey the product rule, but if a operator is linear and obey the product rule is possible to conclude it's a differential operator (it can calculate rates of change, be used to construct the taylor approximation to the function and every other properties we expect from a derivative)?","['manifolds', 'abstract-algebra']"

194881,"If I flip 10 dice, what's the probability I get 1 1, 2 2s, 3 3s, and 4 4s?","If I flip 10 dice, what's the probability I get 1 1, 2 2s, 3 3s, and 4 4s? Here is what I tried: I realized that we can model this question in terms of bit strings. A 0 can represent a single dice roll. Since we roll 10 dice, we have 10 0s. A 1 can represent a separator between different values. Since a dice has 6 possible outcomes, we need 5 1s to separate these values. For instance, the bit string 010010001000011 represents rolling 1 1, 2 2s, 3 3s, and 4 4s. There are ${10 + 6 - 1}\choose{10}$ ways of forming bit strings with 10 0s and 6 - 1 = 5 1s, and the above string is only 1 of these ways. Thus, the answer to the original question is
$\frac{1}{{10 + 6 - 1}\choose{10}} = \frac{1}{3003}$. However, my concern is that my example with the bit strings does not perfectly biject to the original question. Each bit string is equally likely to occur. However, are all combinations of rolls of the 30 dice equally likely to appear?

195000,Meaning of derivatives of vector fields,"I have a doubt about the real meaning of the derivative of a vector field. This question seems silly at first but the doubt came when I was studying the definition of tangent space. If I understood well a vector is a directional derivative operator, i.e.: a vector is an operator that can produce derivatives of scalar fields. If that's the case then a vector acts on a scalar field and tells me how the field changes on that point. However, if a vector is a derivative operator, a vector field defines a different derivative operator at each point. So differentiate a vector would be differentiate a derivate operator, and that seems strange to me at first. I thought for example that the total derivative of a vector field would produce rates of change of the field, but my studies led me to a different approach, where the total derivative produces rates of change only for scalar fields and for vector fields it produces the pushforward. So, what's the real meaning of differentiating a vector field knowing all of this?","['geometry', 'calculus', 'vector-fields', 'differential-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds']"
195006,Does every sequentially ordered infinite set contain sequentially ordered infinite subsets?,"I am not very familiar with mathematical proofs, or the notation involved, so if it is possible to explain in 8th grade English (or thereabouts), I would really appreciate it. Since I may even be using incorrect terminology, I'll try to explain what the terms I'm using mean in my mind. Please correct my terminology if it is incorrect so that I can speak coherently about this answer, if you would. Sequential infinite set: A group of ordered items that flow in a straight line, of which there are infinitely many. So, all integers from least to greatest would be an example, because they are ordered from least to greatest in a sequential line, but an infinite set of bananas would not, since they are not linearly, sequentially ordered. An infinite set of bananas that were to be eaten one-by-one would be, though, because they are iterated through (eaten) one-by-one (in linear sequence). Sequential infinite subsets: Multiple sets within a sequential infinite set that naturally fall into the same order as the items of the sequential infinite set of which they are subsets. So, for example, the infinite set of all integers from least to greatest can be said to have the following two sequential infinite subsets within it: all negative integers; and all positive integers. They are sequential because the negative set comes before the positive set when ordered as stated. They are infinite because they both contain an infinite qty of items, and they are subsets because they are within the greater infinite set of all integers. So I'm wondering if every (not some, but every) sequential infinite set contains within it sequential infinite subsets. The subsets (not the items within them) being sequentially ordered is extremely important. Clearly, a person could take any infinite set, remove one item, and have an infinite subset. Put the item back, remove a different item, and you have multiple infinite subsets. But I need them to be not only non-overlapping, but also sequential in order. Please let me know if this does not make sense, and thank you for dumbing the answer down for me.","['infinity', 'elementary-set-theory']"

195049,is there a better classification of a desirable algebra?,"Consider a finite-dimensional, associative algebra presented as follows:

For example, the direct product algebra $e_i*e_j = \delta_{ij}e_i$ fits this condition. The clarity of the multiplication is partly from a good choice of notation. If I took a different basis then the multiplication could get muddled. For example, $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the commutative direct product algebra is described by $e_1 *e_1=e_1$ and $e_2*e_2=e_2$ and $e_1*e_2=0$. If I instead presented the multiplication by $f_1 = 2e_1+3e_2$ and $f_2=e_1+e_2$ then $f_1*f_1 = 5f_1-6f_2$. Apparently I could be given an algebra where a proper change of notation would induce the $\color{red}{\text{desired property}}$. For the sake of this question, let us define $\mathcal{A}$ as desirable iff there exists some basis $\{f_1,\dots f_n \}$ for $\mathcal{A}$ such that $f_i *f_j = C_{ij}^kf_k$ where no summation is intended over $k$.

Suppose given two morphisms of $S$-schemes $f,g:X \to Y$. Intuitively, I am interested on the locus of points of $X$ in which these two morphisms coincide. A schematic approach to that, would be to consider $Z$ as the pullback of the diagonal $\Delta: Y \to Y\times_S Y$ by the morphism $(f,g): X \to Y\times_S Y$. Then, for example, if $Y\to S$ is separated (""Hausdorff""), then $Z \to X$ is a closed immersion, which makes sense. Also, the composition of $Z \to X$ with $f$ and $g$ are the same (by the commutativity of the cartesian diagram defining $Z$). Hence, I would expect that the scheme $Z$ is what I'm searching. But one could also take a naive, set-theoretic, approach (which we know is usually inappropriate when dealing with schemes) and define the set $A=\{x\in X \mid f(x)=g(x)\}$. My question is: what is the relation between $Z$ and $A$? The most strange thing is that $A$ can be empty, but $Z$ seems to be always well defined.

Forgetting about the complex structure, we can consider the real differential $k$-forms on the underlying smooth manifold; let the space of all such forms be denoted by $\mathcal{E}^k(X)$. We have the following decomposition: $$\mathcal{E}^k(X)\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{C} = \bigoplus_{p+q=k}\mathcal{E}^{p,q}(X).$$ One thing this decomposition tells us is that it is easy to tell if a $(p, q)$-form is a $k$-form (check whether $p + q = k$). What about the converse? Given a (complexified) $k$-form on a complex manifold, is there a way to determine if it is a $(p, q)$-form (for a particular $p$ and $q$ with $p + q = k$)? Of course, this can be done by writing the form locally, but I would prefer a more global approach. My motivation for asking this question is that there is an easy test to tell whether a complexified $1$-form is a $(1, 0)$-form or a $(0, 1)$-form which I outline below. Let $J$ be the almost complex structure induced by the complex structure (extended to the complexified tangent bundle).

195285,How long until everyone has been in the lead?,"Earlier, I asked a question about a series of competitions: A series of matches are held between n identical competitors. Each is won by one of the n with equal probability (no ties). I'm looking for a probabilistic description of the outcome when looking at the first player to win 1, 2, ... matches. Now I am able to ask my full question. In this scenario, what is the expected time until all players have been in the lead at least once? (Say, with probability at least 1/2 -- though other measures of central tendency are probably fine if they're easier to work with.) For $n=1$ this takes only one match. For $n=2$ this is just a 1-D random walk (essentially, start at 1 and see how many steps you take until you become negative); I find that after 9 matches both players have been in the lead with probability 65/128 > 50%. Even with $n=3$ it gets hard to find an exact answer because of the exponential blow-up (it is at least several hundred).

I want to show that $-1$ and $1$ are the infimum and supremum respectively. First I will show that $-1$ is the infimum.  To show this I will first demonstrate that it is indeed a lower bound.  Observe: $$\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{m} \geq \frac{1}{n}-1 \geq -1.$$ I now claim that $-1$ is the greatest lower bound.  So, by the archimedean property, there exists an $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $x>0$ and $n' \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $1<n'x$.

So we let $$-1<y\leq-1+x.$$  By completeness there exists an $r\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $$-1<r<y\leq-1+x.$$  Thus $y$ is not the infimum.

So our integral now looks like
$\frac{1}{i2^{2n}}\int_{|z|=1} \frac{(z+z^{-1})^{2n}}{z}dz$. The inner part of the integral has a singularity at $z = 0$. So we expand it as a Laurent series around the origin.

From the outside, this torus looks just like a normal torus, but it certainly is not because if we consider where the point $(3,0,0)$ goes in the process of the revolution, it is clear that some nonzero rotation will increase the length of the path sweeped out by the point. My question is, how (if?) does the area change?  Moreso, how do you calculate this new area?  (I think this may depend upon the ""fervor"" in which which one twists the torus.
