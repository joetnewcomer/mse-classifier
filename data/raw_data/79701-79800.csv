1026114,Why does Continuous Partial Differentiability Imply Total Differentiability?,"Let $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ be such that the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ exist everywhere and are continuous.

1026175,Contraction vs. iterated function convergence,"Let $X$ be a Banach space with norm $|x|_X$. (For example $X=\mathbb R$) We assume that a function $F: X \rightarrow X$ is Lipschitz continuous but not a contraction map, hence: $$
| F(x) - F(y) |_X < \lambda |x-y|_X
$$
where $\lambda >1$. Furthermore for each $x \in X$: $F^n(x)=F^{n-1}(F(x))$ converges to a $x^*(x)$, which is a fixed point of $F$. Example This seems to be possible for example: $F(x)=e^{-x}$ on $X=[-2,\infty)$ is Lipschitz but not a contraction. But $F^2(x)=e^{-e^{-x}}$ is a contraction and hence the convergence of $F^n$ is given. Question: Is (for the ""everywhere convergence to a fixed point"") necessarily that for some $k\in \mathbb N$, $F^k$ is a contraction map? Do you have an example where this is not the case?","['fixed-point-theorems', 'convergence-divergence', 'functional-analysis', 'functions']"

1026360,$p$-stable Random Variables for $p>2$?,"I will preface this by saying I am certainly no expert in Probability theory. My actual problem is an interpolation one, in which I am considering interpolation of bandlimited functions with shifts of some family of functions.  One such family, with a given parameter $\alpha>0$ is the following $$\phi_\alpha(x):=\dfrac{1}{(2\pi)^\frac{d}{2}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} e^{-\alpha\|\xi\|^p}e^{i\langle x,\xi\rangle}d\xi,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^d.$$ In other words, $\phi_\alpha$ is the inverse Fourier transform of the function $e^{-\alpha\|\cdot\|^p}$. Notation: $\|\cdot\|$ is the Euclidean distance on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and $\langle x,\xi\rangle$ is the usual dot product. One can show that the interpolation scheme works (not important what that means at the moment) as long as $p>0$. It was mentioned to me that this looks a lot like $p$-stable random variables in Probability theory.  However, I noticed in looking up the definition, $p$-stable is usually only defined for $0<p\leq2$. Is there a notion of this for $p>2$, or if not, why? It may well be that there is no connection here, but it was interesting to me that all of the functions I considered could somewhat be related to probability distributions (e.g. Gaussians, and inverse multiquadrics of the form
$$\psi_c(x) := \dfrac{1}{(\|x\|^2+c^2)^\beta},$$

1026522,"Examples of algebro-geometric moduli problems without a ""natural"" choice of pullback?","When I try to learn about stacks, something that is mentioned all over the place (as a reason not to define moduli problems as functors from schemes to groupoids) is the fact that the pullback of a family along a morphism of schemes is not well-defined, but is only defined up to unique isomorphism. 1) Is the fibered product of two maps of schemes well-defined? The tensor product of two rings is certainly well-defined, but maybe this means the fibered product is only well-defined after we make a choice of affine open sets? Or is it that the choice doesn't work with composition because $(A\otimes_RB)\otimes_RC$ is only canonically isomorphic to $A\otimes_R(B\otimes_RC)$? 2) If the answer to the previous question is yes, what is an example of a ""geometric"" moduli problem where there is no obvious choice of pullback of families? I'm familiar with an example from http://people.brandeis.edu/~tbl/minor-thesis.pdf , in which a choice of pullback corresponds to a splitting of some map of groups.

1026527,Complex structure on a real vector bundle,"Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $\pi:E \rightarrow M$ a real vector bundle and note $E_x:=\pi^{-1}(x), \forall x\in M$. We set a bundle $\text{End}(E)=E\otimes E^*$. Now suppose there exists a smooth section $J:M\rightarrow\text{End}(E)$ such that for all $x\in M$, $J_x^2=-\text{Id}_{E_x}$. This gives imidiately that $E$ is of even rang, say $2m$. Now I want to show that the group structure can be reduced to $\text{GL}(m,\mathbb{C})$. Obviously, we can make $E_x$ a $\mathbb{C}$-vector space by defining $i\cdot v=J_xv$, $\forall v\in E_x$. Via a trivialisation $\chi:\pi^{-1}(U)\rightarrow U\times \mathbb{R}^{2m}$ with $x\in U$ we can make $\{x\}\times\mathbb{R}^{2m}$ a $\mathbb{C}$-vector space by setting $i\cdot (x,v)=(x,\chi\circ J_x\circ\chi^{-1}(x,v))$ and then the trivialisation is actually $\mathbb{C}$-linear on $E_x$ However, this doesn't give a desired reduction of the structure group (I guess) and the problem is because the complex structure of $\mathbb{R}^{2m}$ depends on $x$. If we identify $\mathbb{R}^{2m}$ with $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ via some fixed map $J_0$, then the trivialisation is no longer $\mathbb{C}$-linear. Another approach I tried is to give a smooth family of complex bases for $U\times\mathbb{C}^{m}$ through the trivialisation (it is immediate to find such family of real bases).

1026776,Lagrange multipliers: More than one constraint,"I have more or less understood the underlying theory of the Lagrange multiplier method (by using the Implicit Function Theorem). Now, I try to extend this understanding to the general case, where we have more than one constraint. For example we try to maximize/minimize $f(x)$ subject to $g(x)=0$ and $h(x)=0$. As far as I can see, what we should do in this case is simply to build the Lagrange function 
$$L(x,\alpha,\beta) = f(x) + \alpha g(x) + \beta h(x) $$ and then try to maximize/minimize this function, with respect to constraints $g(x)=0$ and $h(x)=0$. To justify this form of the Lagrange function $L(x,\alpha,\beta)$, I thought the following: Assume that we have a point $x'$ which satisfies $g(x')=0$ and $h(x')=0$. If this point is an extreme point on both constraints $g(x)$ and $h(x)$, then it is $$\nabla f(x') = \lambda_1 \nabla g(x')$$ $$\nabla f(x') = \lambda_2 \nabla h(x')$$. We can unify these in a single equation as: $$\nabla f(x') -\dfrac{\lambda_1}{2}\nabla g(x') - \dfrac{\lambda_2}{2}\nabla h(x') = \nabla f(x') + \alpha \nabla g(x') + \beta \nabla h(x')= 0$$ This partially justifies $L(x,\alpha,\beta) = f(x) + \alpha g(x) + \beta h(x)$ for me: Calculate $\nabla_{x}L(x,\alpha,\beta)$, set it equal to zero and solve it; by using $g(x)=0$ and $h(x)=0$ as well. But what disturbs me is that we could not able to find an analytic solution to this most of the time. I have prepared a rough sketch to show it: Here, the constrained extreme points for both $g(x)=0$ and $h(x)=0$ are distinct ($x'$ and $x''$). The only points which satisfy both constraints at the same time are $A$ and $B$. And they are not the extreme points of the both constraint surfaces, it is $\nabla f(A) \neq \alpha \nabla g(A)$ for any $\alpha$ for example. So, my question is, what good is the Lagrangian function $L(x,\alpha,\beta) = f(x) + \alpha g(x) + \beta h(x)$ in such a case? It does not provide an analytic solution for such cases, then what is the point of the Lagrange function and the coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ now? Does this form constitute a good structure for numerical optimization algorithms or what? I am confused about that.

$\frac{1}{x_1}+\frac{1}{x_1-1}=\frac{1}{x_2}+\frac{1}{x_2-1}$. Then, I get: $\frac{(x_1-1)+x_1}{x_1(x_1-1)}=\frac{(x_2-1)+x_2}{x_2(x_2-1)}$.

1026887,Need to draw phase portrait near the equilibrium points of differential equation,"So, this equation 
$$\ddot{x}+3\dot{x}-4x+2x^2 = 0.$$

\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\dot{x} = v, \\
\dot{v} = 2x^2 - 4x - 3v.
\end{array} \right.

Finding the equilibrium points:
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
v = 0 \\
2x^2 - 4x - 3v = 0
\end{array} \right. \ \ \Rightarrow 2x^2 - 4x = 0,  \ \ \Rightarrow  \ \ x_1 = 0, \ x_2 = 2. \ \ \Rightarrow \\ \Rightarrow \boldsymbol{(0,0)}, \

A(x,y)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0     &   1 \\
4-2х  &  -3 \\

Now I need to determine what is happening in each equilibrium point.
For example, first point, $\boldsymbol{(0,0)}$:
$$A(0,0)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0   &  1 \\
4   &  -3 \\

\right)$$
$$\lambda^2 + 3\lambda -4 = 0,$$
$$\lambda_1=1, \ \ \lambda_2=-4$$
Here everything looks fine, the different signs of real roots saying to me it's saddle. But then, let's look at the point $\boldsymbol{(2,0)}$:
$$A(2,0)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0   &  1 \\
0   &  -3 \\

$$\lambda_1 = 0, \ \ \lambda_2 = -3.$$ It means just one eigen vector. Would it be a sink?

(the point with an angle of depression of $32°$) (b) Find the elevation of the plane. So drawing this out, I figured that the flight path of the plane and the highway would be parallel, thus angle A would be the alternate interior angle of the $32°$ angle of depression. The same would apply to angle B and the $48°$ angle of depression on its alternate side. So the third angle must be $100°$.

Now something that wasn't explicit in the question $(a)$ was that $B$ must be non-empty, because the empty set would be linearly independent as well, right?.

Define the function $F:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as $$F(x)=f(x)\prod_{n=1}^\infty\frac{x-\frac{1}{n}}{x-\frac{1}{n}}$$ I have several questions regarding the above, and similarly constructed functions. Intuitively, the function $F(x)$ is almost the same function as $f(x)$. But, there are countably many singularities which have an accumulation point at $f(0)$. The function $F$ also retains the limit structure of $f$ (i.e. $\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow y}F(x)=\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow y}f(x) = f(y)$). I have not had an in depth study of integration. Although, since the set of $x$ such that $F(x)$ is not defined has measure $0$, I would expect some form of integration to be consistent for all intervals of the real line. So the singularities of $F$ seem trivial. However, I would argue the function $F$ is strictly different than the function $f$. Since the construction of $F$ required the knowledge of the continuous function $f$, it seems clear that we can, in some manner, ""patch"" the holes, and treat this function as $f$. Question 1 : Are there certain properties of $F$ which would intuitively be the same as $f$, but are not the same under comparison? (I understand that, looking at $F$ and $f$ as a 1-manifold, there are certainly many topological properties which are not consistent, but this is attributed to $F$ being discontinuous. I'm looking more for an analysts perspective here). Question(s) 2 : If we looked instead at functions of a complex variable, does the $F$ lose any of the information contained in $f$? I mean to say, if $f$ is a continuous and analytic function, then would integrating around the closed contour $|z|=2$ be the same as for $F$? What must be true to about the singularities for this to change? I apologize if I am vague. I'm not looking for answers to each question. I've just been thinking about this and wondering if there is any information regarding functions like the one above.

If $X$ is reflexive space and $(x_n)$ is a sequence in $X$ and for all $\psi \in X^*$, the sequence $\psi(x_n)$ has a limit in $\mathbb C$, then $x_n$ converges weakly to some $x \in X$. Suppose that $X$ is reflexive. Consider the sequence $$u_n = (1, \dots, 1, 0, \dots) \in X,$$ where first $n$ entries are $1$. Then for any $y \in l_1$, we have $$y(u_n) := \sum_n y_n\times u_n = y_1+\dots+y_n \to \sum_n y_n < \infty,$$ since $y$ is absolutely convergent.

Also $\lambda$ is NOT an index in this evaluation) as $$=\lambda x^id_{\lambda}(\partial_i f(\lambda x^j))$$ Using chain rule $$=\lambda x^id_{\lambda}(\lambda\partial_{\lambda_i} f(\lambda x^j))$$ $$=\lambda x^id_{\lambda}(\lambda\partial_{\lambda_i} f(\lambda x^j))$$ Now letting $y^{i'}=\lambda x^i$ and $z^{j'}=\lambda x^j$ then $$=y^{i'}d_{\lambda}(\lambda\partial_{i'} f(z^{j'}))$$ $$=y^{i'}(\partial_{i'} f(z^{j'})+\lambda d_{\lambda}(\partial_{i'} f(z^{j'}))$$ Using chain rule again on $d_\lambda$ $$=y^{i'}(\partial_{i'} f(z^{j'})+\lambda (x^{k}\partial_{k'}\partial_{i'} f(z^{j'})+(\partial_{\lambda}x^k)\partial_{i'} f(z^{j'}))$$ Unpacking the expression by reverting to normal indices $$=\lambda x^i(\frac{1}{\lambda}\partial_{i} f(\lambda x^j)+\lambda (x^{k}\frac{1}{\lambda^{(2)}}\partial_{k}\partial_{i} f(\lambda x^j)+(\partial_{\lambda}x^k)\frac{1}{\lambda}\partial_{i} f(\lambda x^j))$$ $$= x^i\partial_{i} f(\lambda x^j)+ x^ix^{k}\partial_{k}\partial_{i} f(\lambda x^j)+\lambda x^i(\partial_{\lambda}x^k)\partial_{i} f(\lambda x^j)$$ Unpacking the expression by reverting to del operators $$= \mathbf{x}\cdot\nabla f(\lambda \mathbf{x})+ \mathbf{x}\cdot ( (\mathbf{x}\cdot\nabla)\otimes(\nabla f(\lambda \mathbf{x}))+\lambda \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial\lambda}\otimes(\mathbf{x}\cdot\nabla) f(\lambda \mathbf{x})$$ The partial derivative is zero since $\mathbf{x}$ is independent of $\lambda$ Thus finally $$= \mathbf{x}\cdot\nabla f(\lambda \mathbf{x})+ \mathbf{x}\cdot ( (\mathbf{x}\cdot\nabla)\otimes(\nabla f(\lambda \mathbf{x}))$$ But this term is not necessary zero for all $\mathbf{x}$ , so how does the proof of the converse of the Euler Homogeneous function theorem in the pics above got rid of it?","['multivariable-calculus', 'tensors', 'functions']"

1027742,Vector fields on manifolds,"I have recently started a course on differential geometry (from a physicists perspective) and I am having trouble convincing myself why vector fields are represented as differential operators on manifolds? Is it because, in general, one cannot define a vector on a manifold as an arrow between two points on the manifold (as it generally will not be Euclidean) and as such the best we can do is consider the tangent space at each point on the manifold. Now, we could define vectors as the directional derivatives of the coordinate curves at that point, however this is very much coordinate dependent, which doesn't fit in with the notion of a vector. As such, if we consider tangent vector at a point as a differential operator that defines a tangent space at that point, then we satisfy the axioms of a vector space and thus achieve the notion of vectors on manifolds? Apologies for any inaccuracies and the wordiness of my attempt to answer my problem. I would really appreciate an intuitive explanation if possible.

1027767,Alternate proof of Schur orthogonality relations,"I am trying to find an alternate proof for Schur orthogonality relations along the following lines. Let $G$ be a finite group, with irreducible representations $V_1$, $V_2$, $\cdots$, $V_d$. Let $V$ denote the adjoint representation ($V = \langle \{e_g\}_{g\in G} \rangle$ with $h\cdot e_g = e_{hgh^{-1}}$). Also, let $W$ denote the representation given by $\bigoplus_{i=1}^{d} \text{End} (V_i)$. The Schur orthogonality relations tell us these both have the same character, hence are isomorphic. But this requires one to assume the fact that $\{\chi_{V_i} \}_{i=1..d}$ forms a basis for the class functions on $G$. I would like to show $V \cong W$ by some other means, maybe an explicit isomorphism. This would prove Schur orthogonality without knowing the fact about the basis for class functions.

1027770,Volume of sphere,I know the formula of sphere and have seen number of derivations using with and without calculus. I was using a common sense approach of using a slice and rotating this slice 360deg. Number of such slices would be 2(pi)(r) which is length of base circle of hemi-sphere. Then we can multiply the volume by 2 to get volume of entire sphere. I am using same logic as used for volume of a cylinder which is using a small slice and using number of such slices as height of the cylinder which is also its length.
