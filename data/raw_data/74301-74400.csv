918684,GRE textbooks question - calculus and linear algebra,"I'll be taking the Math GRE subject test in a few months. I know that it is best to focus on being able to answer all the calculus, DEs, and linear algebra questions (and quickly). I'm a pure math student, so my computational skills and speed aren't so great because I'm out of practice. I'm wondering what texts are best to prepare with. I know Stewart is commonly recommended for preparing for the calculus questions. My university used Calculus: Early Transcendentals by Edwards & Penney. I can get Stewart out of the library, so I was just wondering which would be a better resource (especially in terms of practice problems). Is Stewart sufficient for differential equations? Secondly, what are some good linear algebra books? I have Sheldon Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right, but this doesn't teach much in the way of computational skills, so I need something that would be good for that. I have also purchased the Princeton Review's Cracking the GRE Subject Test, which I've heard is not awesome but still worth having.","['book-recommendation', 'linear-algebra', 'calculus', 'reference-request']"
918687,When are the coordinates of the intersection points of plane curves actually algebraic conjugates,"Suppose $f(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ is an irreducible polynomial defining a plane curve. Say I want to find the intersection of this plane curve with the line defined by g(x,y)=y-ax+b. One way to do this would be to find the resultant $Res(f,g;x)$ to find the $y$-coordinates of the affine intersection points and then plug them into the line to get the corresponding $x$-coordinates. Question: Are there conditions on $f$ and $g$ that guarantee that $Res(f,g;x)$ is an irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[y]$? That is, when is it true that the $y$-coordinates in the intersection points are all algebraic conjugates. I would also appreciate any references.","['algebraic-geometry', 'irreducible-polynomials', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'algebraic-curves']"
918739,What is the flaw in this proof that all triangles are isosceles?,"What is the flaw in this ""proof"" that all triangles are isosceles? From the linked page: One well-known illustration of the logical fallacies to which Euclid's methods are vulnerable (or at least would be vulnerable if we didn't ""cheat"" by allowing ourselves to be guided by accurately drawn figures) is the ""proof"" that all triangles are isosceles. Given an arbitrary triangle ABC, draw the angle bisector of the interior angle at A, and draw the perpendicular bisector of segment BC at D, as shown below: If the angle bisector at A and the perpendicular bisector of BC are parallel, then ABC is isosceles. On the other hand, if they are not parallel, they intersect at a point, which we call P, and we can draw the perpendiculars from P to AB at E, and to AC at F. Now, the two triangles labeled ""alpha"" in this figure have equal angles and share a common side, so they are totally equal. Therefore, PE = PF. Also, since D is the midpoint of BC, it's clear that the triangles labeled ""gamma"" are equal right triangles, and so PB = PC. From this it follows that the triangles labeled ""beta"" are similar and equal to each other, so we have BE+EA = CF+FA, meaning the triangle ABC is isosceles. All theorems from Euclidean geometry used in the argument are correct. I know this statement is false but I was wondering if anyone knew what the problem was. I'm very confused about solving this question.","['geometry', 'triangles', 'recreational-mathematics', 'fake-proofs']"

Can it be called a 1D function if its plot is 2D? Subsequently, can two-variable functions $f(x,y)$ (that have coordinates $x,y,z$) be called a 2D function if its plot is 3D?

918949,Characterization of the exterior derivative $d$,"In the paper Natural Operations on Differential Forms , the author R. Palais shows that the exterior derivative $d$ is characterized as the unique ""natural"" linear map from $\Phi^p$ to $\Phi^{p+1}$ (Palais' $\Phi^p$ is what is perhaps more commonly written as $\Omega^p$, and ""commutes with all diffeomorphisms"", I believe, means $f^*(d\omega) = d(f^*\omega)$): the exterior derivative on $p$-forms is determined to within a scalar factor by the condition that it be a linear mapping into $p+1$ forms which commutes with all diffeomorphisms. I've tried to read the proof in the paper, but I'm struggling to follow the details and missing a sense of the big picture of the proof. I'm interested in Palais' claim because this characterization is the most compelling one I have seen $-$ it seems far more appropriate as an axiomatic definition of $d$ than the definitions found in many textbooks, which often define $d$ based on properties such as
$d(\alpha \wedge \beta) = d\alpha \wedge \beta + (-1)^k \alpha \wedge d\beta$ (where $\alpha$ is a $k$-form),
$d^2=0$,
or $d(\sum \omega_{i_1...i_k}dx_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_k}) = \sum d\omega_{i_1...i_k} \wedge dx_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_k}$.
While these are indeed quite basic properties of $d$, they are more appropriate as theorems than as a priori assumptions. (Of course, what is more ""natural"" is a matter of opinion, so please don't belabor the issue.) Since it's such an innocent-looking and natural characterization, I would like to see a clear, motivated, reasonably elementary proof of it. Why ought it to be true that there is only one natural linear map from $\Omega^p$ to $\Omega^{p+1}$, up to a constant multiple?

918982,T//W for adjoint type group PGL3,"Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group and $T$ a maximal torus (over $\mathbb{C}$).  It is well known that if $G$ is simply connected type then $T//W = \mathbb{A}^r$. I want to verify that the following computation is correct (I have some doubts).  I claim that $T//W$ for $G = PGL_3$ is the affine variety with coordinate ring $k[x^2, xy, y^2] = k[A,B,C]/AC - B^2$, i.e. the quadric cone. The argument is as follows.  The characters of the torus, thought of as monomials, generate the coordinate ring of the torus as a vector space.  For $PGL_3$ the character lattice coincides with the root lattice.  Algebraic generators (as a ring) of the ring of invariants $k[T]^W$ then are given by generators of the dominant Weyl chamber (and acting on them by $W$, but this doesn't change the relations).  The generators are given by $(1, 1)$ (a root), $(2,0)$ and $(0, 2)$ where $(a, b)$ is $a \omega_1 + b \omega_2$ for $\omega_1, \omega_2$ fundamental weights.  Thus, $k[x^2, xy, y^2]$.

919119,A Group Having a Cyclic Sylow 2-Subgroup Has a Normal Subgroup.,"I want to prove the following: Let $G$ be a group of order $2^nm$, where $m$ is odd, having a cyclic Sylow $2$-subgroup.
    Then $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $m$. ATTEMPT: We will show that $G$ has a subgroup of order $m$.
Let $\theta:G\to \text{Sym}(G)$ be the homomorphism which is defined as

where $t_g:G\to G$ is defined as:
$$

$$
Let $g$ be an element of order $2^n$ in $G$.
(There exists such an element since $G$ has a cyclic Sylow $2$-subgroup.) The cyclce representation of $t_g$ is a product of $m$ disjoint cycles each of length $2^n$.
Therefore $t_g$ is an odd permutation. Thus the homomorphism $\epsilon\circ \theta:G\to\{\pm 1\}$, where $\epsilon:\text{Sym}\to\{\pm 1\}$ is the sign homomorphism, is a surjection. By the First Isomprphism Theorem, we conclude that the kernel $K$ of $\epsilon\circ \theta$ is of order $2^{n-1}m$. If $n$ were equal to $1$ then we are done. If $n>1$ then note that any Sylow $2$-subgroup of $K$ is also cyclic.
This is because each Sylow $2$-subgroup of $K$ is contained in a Sylow $2$-subgroup of $G$, where the latter is cyclic. Now we can inductively show that $K$ has a subgroup of order $m$.

where $\lfloor x\rfloor $ represents the largest integer not greater than $x$. Supposing $a\gt A_n$ gives us
$$n!=2^a-2^b\ge 2^{A_n+1}-2^{A_n}=2^{A_n}\gt n!.$$ 
This is a contradiction. Hence, we have $a=A_n=\lfloor \log_2{n!}\rfloor+1$. $(3)$ $b$ can be represented by $n$ : We have $n!=2^b(2^{a-b}-1).$ Since $2^b$ is even and $2^{a-b}-1$ is odd, we know that $b$ is the number of $2$ as a prime factor of $n!$, namely
$$b=\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor}\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2^k}\right\rfloor.$$ $(4)$ From $(2),(3)$, the question can be represented as the following : Question : Are there infinitely many positive integer $n$ which satisfy the following equality?
  $$n!=2^{\lfloor \log_2{n!}\rfloor+1}-2^{\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor}\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2^k}\right\rfloor}$$
  If Yes , then how can we prove that? If No , then how can we find every such $n$? $(5)$ It seems that $n\ge6$ don't satisfy the equation in $(4)$ using computer. Can anyone help?","['factorial', 'exponential-diophantine-equations', 'elementary-number-theory']"

An approach to solving this problem for positive integer-valued solutions is to imagine that you have $n$ indistinguishable objects lined up and that you want to divide them into $r$ nonempty groups. To do so, you can select $r-1$ of the $n-1$ spaces between adjacent objects as the dividing points. See the diagram below for a visual representation. $$0_\wedge0_\wedge0_\wedge..._\wedge0_\wedge0$$ $$n\,\, objects\,\,0$$
$$Choose\,\,r-1\,\,of\,\,the\,\,spaces\,\,_\wedge.$$ For instance if you have $n=8$ and $r=3$ and you choose the 2 divisors so as to obtain $$000|000|00$$ then the resulting vector is $x_1 = 3. x_2 = 3, x_3 = 2.$ As there are $n-1\choose r-1$ possible selections, you have the following proposition.

Suppose that a uniformly most powerful test $\delta^*$ exists and let $\beta^*$ denote its power function.

Show that $C^1[0,1]$ with the norm defined as $\|f\|=\|f\|_\infty + \|f^\prime\|_\infty$ is a Banach space. I started with an arbitrary Cauchy sequence, $f_n \to f$ , so we know that for every $\epsilon > 0, \exists M \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\|f_n - f\| \leq \epsilon , \forall n \geq M.$ Where I am getting stuck, is how do we then show that $f \in C^1[0,1]$ , and that therefore $C^1[0,1]$ with the norm defined, is complete (and therefore a Banach space). So here is my attempted solution, based on the comments below: Assume $f_n$ is a Cauchy sequence in $C^1[0,1]$ , then for every $\epsilon > 0, \exists M \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $$\|f_n - f_m\|=\|f_n - f_m\|_\infty + \|f_n^\prime - f_m^\prime \|_\infty \leq \epsilon, \forall m,n\geq M.$$ So for any fixed $x \in C^1[0,1], \|f_n - f_m\|_\infty \leq \epsilon$ and $\|f_n^\prime - f_m^\prime \|_\infty \leq \epsilon$ and thus for this fixed $x$ $f_n$ and $f_n^\prime$ are Cauchy sequences, and therefore converge: $f_n \to f$ and $f_n^\prime \to f^\prime.$ So let $m \to \infty$ then $\|f_n - f\|\leq \epsilon, \forall n\geq M, \forall x\in [0,1]$ . Then: \begin{align}\|f_n - f\|&= \|f_n - f\|_\infty + \|f_n^\prime - f^\prime \|_\infty\\
&=\sup_{x\in [0,1]}|f_n(x)-f(x)| + \sup_{x\in [0,1]}|f_n^\prime (x)-f^\prime (x)|\\&\leq \epsilon\quad \forall n\geq M.

Just imagine we have some sort of a machine that shows us one by one a list of randomly drawn numbers between $0$ and $1$. We are comparing the observed numbers one by one to some special number chosen beforehand, for example $\frac12$. Now, given that at some iteration we have observed that special number at least once, does that mean that $\frac12$ has some positive probability under that (unknown) distribution? And if the probability can be zero, can we nevertheless say that we will necessarily observe $\frac12$ again later, if we continue the experiment ad infimum? Also, disregard the ""real world limitations"" such as an inability to produce truly uniformly distibuted numbers, or rounding errors or any such thing.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"
920285,Show that for a sequence of real numbers $(a_n)_n$ $\lim_n a_n=0$ implies $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\lvert a_i\rvert=0$,"Let $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be q sequence of real numbers with $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=0$. Show that this implies
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\lvert a_i\rvert=0.
$$ This is my idea how to prove it, unfortunately do not know if it is right: Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be arbitrary, then there exists a $N(\varepsilon)$ with $\lvert a_n\rvert < \varepsilon$ for all $n\geqslant N(\varepsilon)$. So it is 
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\lvert a_i\rvert=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\lvert a_i\rvert=\sum_{i=0}^{N(\varepsilon)-1}\lvert a_i\rvert+\sum_{i=N(\varepsilon)}^{\infty}\lvert a_i\rvert\leqslant\sum_{i=0}^{N(\varepsilon)-1}\lvert a_i\rvert+\sum_{i=N(\varepsilon)}^{\infty}\varepsilon\leqslant M
$$
for a $M\geqslant 0$ for $\varepsilon \to 0$. So the limits exists. Because $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}=0$, i.e. the limit exsits, too, one can write the limit as the product of both limits, i.e.
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\lvert a_i\rvert=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\cdot\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\lvert a_i\rvert=0\cdot M=0.

920292,How many points to span a goniometric wave and how to construct the goniometric function,"I have two questions concerning the spanning of a simple trigonometric function: What is the minimum number of points to define/span a ""simple"" trigonometric wave in two dimensions? Is it possible to give a generic trigonometric function give a set of points - something like a function in the form of: $f(x) = A \cdot \sin (\varphi + \frac{ P }{2\cdot \pi }\cdot x)$, with $A$, $\varphi$ and $P$ expressed in a set of $(x_{i},y_{i})$'s? Notes: I'm looking to span/define a ""simple"" trigonometric wave, so the argument of the trigonometric function can be a linear transformation of $x$ (but it's not more complex than that). my question is not about fitting a curve through some points, but to define a function using point. Like a line is defined using two points, say $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ and that the equation of that line is: $f(x)=-\frac{\left( x1-x\right) \,y2+\left( x-x2\right) \,y1}{x2-x1}$ I have a ""hunch"" that the number of required points is 3, but I can´t explain it. With trigonometric functions, of course there are a multiple of equations fitting a set of points, because of the repetitive character of the function. The solution has probably some ""modulo"".","['trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus', 'functions']"
