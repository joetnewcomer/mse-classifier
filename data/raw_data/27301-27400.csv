251948,How is it useful to know what the dual of a space is isomorphic to?,"Wikipedia has a neat spaces and their duals . For example, it lists that the dual of $c_0$ is $l_1$. But how can I use that knowledge? I'm trying to prove something for all functions of the dual of $c_0$, and figured that I could use my familiarity of $l_1$ to get some properties of those functions. But I don't know how. For example, which element of $l_1$ corresponds to which functional of $c_0$? I suppose their ""scalar product"" (multiply $x\in c_0$ with $y\in l_1$ element-wise and sum the products) would be such a functional. If that's true, I could probably prove it. But I only came up with it because that was my intuition. Is there a more mechanical way? I realize that it's hard to answer the question without knowing exactly which problem I'm trying to solve, but perhaps there are some general strategies? Sorry if the question seems confused and ""ranty""; I'm having a hard time sorting this out.",['functional-analysis']
251955,Does a four-variable analog of the Hall-Witt identity exist?,"Lately I have been thinking about commutator formulas, sparked by rereading the following paragraph in Isaacs (p.125): An amazing commutator formula is the Hall-Witt identity: $$[x,y^{-1},z]^y[y,z^{-1},x]^z[z,x^{-1},y]^x=1,$$ which holds for any three elements of every group.  $\ldots$  One can think of the Hall-Witt formula as a kind of three-variable version of the much more elementary two-variable identity, $[x,y][y,x]=1$.  This observation hints at the possibility that a corresponding four-variable formula might exist, but if there is such a four-variable identity, it has yet to be discovered. To my knowledge a four-variable formula hasn't been discovered since this was written.  I was thinking about this and found myself unable to even decide whether or not I thought one could exist (i.e. whether one would, hypothetically, try to find an identity or disprove its existence).  Thus, I am attempting to ""write down the problem."" How can one rigorously formulate the question, ""Does a four-variable analog of the Hall-Witt identity exist?"" Let's start by explicitly making the free group on $4$ letters.  Suppose we have a free generating set $A=\{a,b,c,d\}$, so that $S=A\cup A^{-1}$ and $A^{-1}=\{a^{-1},b^{-1},c^{-1},d^{-1}\}$.  Let $F_A$ the group of all reduced words in $S$.  Words are reduced when they have been can no longer be simplified by cancelling adjacent $x$ and $x^{-1}$s (for $x\in A$). Cyclically reduced words are words where the first and last letters are not inverse to each other.  Every word is conjugate to a cyclically reduced word, so we can consider $\hat{F_A}$, the quotient of $F_A$ by the equivalence relation of being cyclically reduced.  (Note that this is not the equivalence relation of being conjugate.) Let $\Phi$ be the set of functions $\varphi:A^4\rightarrow \hat{F_A}$ defining words in $\hat{F_A}$ that contain at least one instance of each free generator or its inverse.  Now let $\Psi:\Phi\rightarrow \hat{F_A}$ be formally defined by $$\Psi(\varphi)(u,x,y,z)=\varphi(u,x,y,z)\varphi(x,y,z,u)\varphi(y,z,u,x)\varphi(z,u,x,y).$$
So, if a $4$-variable Hall-Witt identity exists, it will be among the functions in the preimage of $0$ (the function which just maps everything to the empty word) under $\Psi$. Question: Assuming the above formulation is sound, does there exist a (nontrivial) four-variable analog to the Hall-Witt identity?  Can this approach be used to further refine the question? My use of ""nontrivial"" above is somewhat ambiguous: what I mean is that the identity should be made with commutators and conjugations in a free set of four letters, and done so in a way that it does not reduce to the two- or three-variable commutator identities by a substitution. Progress. Let $$\begin{eqnarray*}
W(a,b,c) & \triangleq & [a,b^{-1},c]^b \\
 &=& b^{-1}[a,b^{-1}]^{-1}c^{-1}[a,b^{-1}]cb\\
&=&a^{-1}b^{-1}ac^{-1}a^{-1}bab^{-1}cb.\end{eqnarray*}$$ Let's chop $W(a,b,c)$ in half and name the two parts.  Define $$w_1(a,b,c)\triangleq a^{-1}b^{-1}ac^{-1}a^{-1} \hspace{30pt} \text{and} \hspace{30pt} w_2(a,b,c)\triangleq bab^{-1}cb,$$ so that $$W(a,b,c)=w_1(a,b,c)w_2(a,b,c).$$  Now, the Hall-Witt Identity can be written as $$W(x,y,z)W(y,z,x)W(z,x,y)=1,$$ that is, $$\overbrace{\underbrace{x^{-1}y^{-1}xz^{-1}x^{-1}}_{w_1(x,y,z)}\underbrace{yxy^{-1}zy}_{w_2(x,y,z)}}^{W(x,y,z)} \overbrace{\underbrace{y^{-1}z^{-1}yx^{-1}y^{-1}}_{w_1(y,z,x)}\underbrace{zyz^{-1}xz}_{w_2(y,z,x)}}^{W(y,z,x)}  \overbrace{\underbrace{z^{-1}x^{-1}zy^{-1}z^{-1}}_{w_1(z,x,y)}\underbrace{xzx^{-1}yx}_{w_2(z,x,y)}}^{W(z,x,y)} =1.$$
It's clear the cancellation works by $w_1(b,c,a)=w_2(a,b,c)^{-1}$.  This makes sense: we should be able to cyclically permute the overall word and have it still work, since $1^a=1$.  So, what we should be looking for are four letter strings $w_1$ and $w_2$ such that $w_1(a,b,c,d)$ is the inverse of $w_2(b,c,d,a)$. Update :
In fact, the above observation is not just sufficient, but necessary for the existence of a four-variable Hall-Witt identity.   Consider for example the case where $W(a,b,c,d)$ would be split into three subwords, rather than two: $$W(a,b,c,d)=w_1(a,b,c,d)w_2(a,b,c,d)w_3(a,b,c,d).$$  We would in this case have to insist that $$w_3(a,b,c,d)=w_1(b,c,d,a)^{-1}\hspace{14pt}\text{ and }\hspace{14pt}w_2(a,b,c,d)=w_2(b,c,d,a)^{-1}.$$  After the $w_1$'s and $w_3$'s cancelled out, we'd be left with $$w_2(x,y,z,u)w_2(y,z,u,x)w_2(z,u,x,y)w_2(u,x,y,z)=1.$$ But of course asking whether that that can happen is the same as asking whether $W$ can exist, so eventually we will see a separation into two subwords, or we have a contradiction by infinite descent.  If we divided up $W(a,b,c,d)$ into $n>3$ subwords, we would reduce in the case of odd $n$ to the case of a self-inverse word analogously to the $n=3$ case, or we would have an even number of subwords, which is the same thing as the $2$ subword case. So, it suffices to either find a word $W(a,b,c,d)=w_1(a,b,c,d)w_2(a,b,c,d)$, nontrivial in each variable, such that $w_1(a,b,c,d)=w_2(b,c,d,a)^{-1}$, or to prove that such a word does not exist.","['algebraic-topology', 'intuition', 'free-groups', 'group-theory']"

251961,Expected number of cumulative distinct values when sampling with replacement from a changing population over time,"I'm trying to estimate the cumulative number of distinct values when sampling with replacement from a changing population of integers over time. Concretely (and forgive my awful notation here), I'm assuming that there is some initial population ($m_0 = \{0,1,2,...n_0\}$) which experiences a constant rate $d$ at which members are removed from the pool and a constant rate   $a$ at which members are added. Which members are removed is random, s.t. the size of a set at some time period can be written as:$$|m_t| = |m_{t-1}| * (1 + a - d)$$ I know that for some set time period the estimated number of distinct values I see when drawing $s$ samples from a population of size $p$ is one of the solutions to the Birthday Problem, i.e.:
$$p*(1-(1-1/p)^s)$$
At this point, however, I'm a little stuck. I'm tempted to try to go the route of estimating the expected number of set members not seen in a cumulative time period, and I've also been encouraged to try to solve a more incremental version of the above problem as a stepping-stone (e.g. to try and solve the case where after each sample is taken the underlying population increases by one) At this point I've spent a good couple of hours trying to find any leads on this and haven't  had much success, so any and all pointers, help, etc. would be appreciated.

252258,Element Argument Proofs - Set theory,"This is an exercise on my study guide for my discrete applications class. Prove by element argument: A × (B ∩ C) = (A × B) ∩ (A × C) Now I know that this is the distributive law, but I'm not sure if this proof would work in the exact same way as a union problem would, because I know how to solve that one. Here is my thinking thus far: Proof:  Suppose A, B, and C are sets. A × (B ∩ C) = (A × B) ∩ (A × C) Case 1 (a is a member of A): if a belongs to A, then by the definition of the cartesian product, a is also a member of A x B and A x C. By definition of intersection, a belongs to (A × B) ∩ (A × C). Case 2 (a is a member of B ∩ C): a is a member of both B and C by intersection. a is a member of (A × B) ∩ (A × C) by the definition of intersection. By definition of a subset, (A × B) ∩ (A × C) is a subset of A × (B ∩ C). Therefore A × (B ∩ C) = (A × B) ∩ (A × C). Is that at least a little right?

Since $f_n(2/n) = 4e^{-2}$, we know that our function cannot converge uniformly on $[0,\infty)$ since $||f_n||\not\rightarrow 0$. On the interval of $[a,\infty)$ $f_n$ does converge uniformly, because for large $n$, $2/n \rightarrow 0$, and therefore $a>2/n$ and thus $||f_n|| = n^2a^2e^{-na}$ which tends towards zero, and thus converges uniformly. My question : It seems that the problem is at $x=0$ because removing this point allows for uniform convergence. What I dont get is why $x=0$ causes a problem to begin with. If we analyze $f_n$ pointwise at $x=0$, dont we have that $f_n(0) = 0$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$?

252526,Computing the SVD factorization on C++ (using the proof of the existence of the SVD factorization),"I am doing a C++ program that computes the SVD factorization of a real matrix A without using any known library of algebra that contains the implementation. In addition, QR descomposition is not allowed in any step (because one of my goals is to compare QR and SVD descomposition in a least squares problem). I know there are a lot of methods, with well tecniques, but my method is simple, far from being the fastest and better one, but it is based on a proof of the theorem about SVD factorization that I have done at University. I know that it is not the best way (I accept ideas and proposals if you want to tell me something better). The proof of the theorem (and the diagram of my algorithm) is: Teorem: Let $A \in M_{m,n} (\mathbb{R})$, with $m \geq n$. Then exists the $A$ = 
  $U \cdot \Sigma \cdot V^T $, with these properties: $U\in M_{m,n} (\mathbb{R})$ satisfies $U \cdot U^T = I_n$ (orthogonal
  matrix) $\Sigma \in M_{n,n} (\mathbb{R})$ is a diagonal matrix with $\Sigma =$
  diag$(\sigma_1, \sigma_2,..., \sigma_n)$ $V\in M_{n,n} (\mathbb{R})$ satisfies $V \cdot V^T = I_n$ (orthogonal
  matrix) Proof: Construct $S = A^T \cdot A$, so $S \in M_{n,n} (\mathbb{R})$. We have
  that $S$ is a symmetric and positive semi-definite matrix (you can
  check that as an exercise, but if you want to know why it is true ask
  me and then I'll write the proof of that). According to that, we can find an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$
  of eigenvectors, $\mathbb{R}^n = [u_1,u_2,...,u_n]$, with
  $<u_i,u_j>=d_{ij}$, with $d_{ij}=0$ if $j\neq i$ and $d_{ij}=1$ if $j
> = i$. Let be $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, ..., \lambda_n$ the respective eigenvalues. Let be $1 \leq r \leq n$, with $\lambda_1, \lambda_2,...,
> \lambda_r \geq 0$, and $\lambda_{r+1}, \lambda_{r+2}, \lambda_{n} = 0$
  (remember that $S$ is a positive semi-definite matrix, so eigenvalues
  can't be negative). Then, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, so our $\Sigma = $diag$(\sigma_1,
> \sigma_2,..., \sigma_n)$ it is now constructed. In addition, we will
  say that $V=(v_1,v_2,...,v_n)$, and our matrix $V$ is now constructed
  too. At the end we will see that all these definitions make sense and
  the descomposition works. Finally, let's find the matrix U. We introduce the vectors $u_i = \frac{1}{\sigma_i} \cdot A \cdot v_i$,
  for $1 \leq i \leq r$. These are unitary and two-by-two orthonormal
  vectors (you can check that as an exercise, if you want to know the
  proof tell me). Now we choose $u_{r+1}, u_{r+2},..., u_{n} \in 
> \mathbb{R}^m$ that makes {$u_1, u_2,...,u_r,u_{r+1},u_{r+2},...,u_n$}
  an orthonomal basis of $\mathbb{R}^m$. And we finally have our last
  matrix $U = (u_1, u_2, ... , u_n)$. Let's check if the factorization
  is correct. It is easy to see that $A \cdot V = U \cdot \Sigma$ : we have that $ A
> \cdot v_j = \sigma_j  \cdot \frac{1}{\sigma_j} \cdot A \cdot v_j =
> \sigma_j \cdot u_j$ for $1 \leq j \leq r$ and $A \cdot v_j = 0$ for
  $r+1 \leq j \leq n$, so the equality it's true. Then, as the last
  step, we see that $V$ is an orthogonal matrix (because the column
  vectors make an orthonormal basis), so $V^{-1} = V^T$ and $A \cdot V
> \cdot V^T = U \cdot \Sigma \cdot V^T \iff A = U \cdot \Sigma \cdot
> V^T$, as we wanted to proof $\blacksquare$ First, I want to use a method like the power method to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $S$, knowing that $S$ is a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix. The problem of using the power method is that it does not use the properties of $S$, and it finds only one eigenvector for one eigenvalue, and I want to find all the eigenvectors linked with a given eigenvalue... in fact, I want to know a basis of the eigenspace corresponding to a given eigenvalue. First question: Do you know a good algorithm (not too difficult) to find all the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue? (not only one, if more than one eigenvector have the same eigenvalue). Does this method give me the orthonormal basis of eigenvectors? I can't use the QR algorithm (I currently saw an algorithm to find the eigenspace of an eigenvalue using QR factorization). If I have this algorithm, it's very easy to find $V$, $\Sigma$ and the $u_1,u_2,...,u_r$ of the proof. The last step is to find $u_{r+1},...,u_{n}$ vectors that make {$u_1,...,u_n$} an orthonormal basis. Second (and last) question: Do you know a good algorithm to, given some two-by-two orthonormal vectors, complete them to a basis of the corresponding vectorial space? I don't know if it's useful to find linearly independent vectors and use the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to make an orthonormal basis: in fact, if I do this I'm using a half of a part of the QR implementation (that can be done with Gram-Schmidt), so if it is an alternative to this I will be grateful to read it.

252629,Generalization of Bernoulli's Inequality.,"When you're first taking an Introduction to Proofs class, you eventually learn about induction. One of the first induction proofs I did was to prove for $n \geq 1$ that $(1+x)^n \geq 1+nx$. You first prove the base case, $n=1$, which yields $(1+x)^1 \geq 1+1x$, which is true. Then you assume that the inequality holds for for the arbitrary $n$ case. Then you try to prove that the inequality holds for $n+1$, i.e. $(1+x)^(n+1) \geq 1+nx$ as well. Using our assumption that $(1+x)^n \geq 1+nx$, we can multiply both sides by $1+x$, which yields $(1+x)*(1+x)^n \geq (1+nx)*(1+x).$
Since $1+nx^2+nx +x \geq 1+(n+1)x$, the inequality is proven.
Now what I’m trying to do is prove a generalization of Bernoulli’s inequality, i.e. the following. “Find the least possible $\alpha < 0$ so that $\forall x \geq \alpha$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, that $(1+x)^n \geq 1+nx$. Prove the inequality as well as prove that your $\alpha$ is best possible.” What I’m trying to figure out is what is more special about this question rather than the typical inductive Bernoulli’s inequality proof? What is the purpose of introducing this alpha restricted to less than zero? There must be a reason for it. I read a few different textbooks and they all say that it (it referring to Bernoulli's inequality) works for $x > -1$, so I’m assuming that the alpha would also be -1 because then for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \geq \alpha$, the normal Bernoulli’s inequality holds. Am I completely going off the deep end? Any input would be very much appreciated.","['inequality', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

252724,Solving a quadratic equation via a tangent half-angle formula,"(Maybe I'll post my own answer here, but maybe others will make that redundant.) This is a fun (?) trivia item that fell out of a bit of geometry I was thinking about. One of the tangent half-angle formulas says
$$
\tan\frac\alpha2 = \frac{\sin\alpha}{1+\cos\alpha}.
$$ Consider the quadratic equation
$$
x^2 + 2bx - 1 = 0.
$$
Solving for $b$, we get
$$
b = \frac{1-x^2}{2x}.
$$
Let $\alpha=\arctan b$. Since $\tan\alpha=(1-x^2)/2x$, we have $\sin\alpha=(1-x^2)/(1+x^2)$ and $\cos\alpha=2x/(1-x^2)$, so
$$
\tan\frac\alpha2=\frac{1-x^2}{(1+x)^2}.
$$
Lo and behold, this fraction is not in lowest terms, and we have
$$
\tan\frac\alpha2= \frac{\sin\alpha}{1+\cos\alpha} = \frac{1-x}{1+x}.
$$
This implies
$$
(1+x)\tan\frac\alpha2= 1-x
$$
and so we seem to have reduced a second-degree equation to a first-degree equation by using the tangent half-angle formula. Solving for $x$, we get
$$
x=\frac{1-\tan\frac\alpha2}{1+\tan\frac\alpha2}.\tag{1}
$$
Since $\tan\alpha=b$, we have $\sin\alpha=b/\sqrt{1+b^2}$ and $\cos\alpha=1/\sqrt{1+b^2}$, so
$$
\tan\frac\alpha2=\frac{\sin\alpha}{1+\cos\alpha}=\frac{b}{1+\sqrt{1+b^2}}.
$$
Sustituting this back into $(1)$, we get
$$
x = \frac{1+\sqrt{b^2-1}-b}{1+\sqrt{b^2+1}+b} = -b+\sqrt{b^2+1}.

How many ordered triplets $(x,y,z)$ satisfy $x^3+y^3+z^3=3xyz$? x,y,z are allowed to be equal. When I tried I got any one of x,y,z to be 0. I am not sure this is correct. And I got 21 as the answer which i am sure is not.","['number-theory', 'combinatorics']"
