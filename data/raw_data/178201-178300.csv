3222355,How can the derivative of $f:M\to \mathbb R$ where $M$ is a differentiable manifold can be well defined since it's not unique?,"I have a doubt about the fact that a derivative of $f:M\to \mathbb R$ of a $\mathcal C^1$ manifold is well defined... Indeed, let $a\in M$ and $(U,\varphi )$ a chart from a $\mathbb C^1$ atlas s.t. $a\in A$ . Then, $$f'(a)=\left.\frac{d}{dx}\right|_{x=\varphi (a)}f(\varphi ^{-1}(x)).$$ But if $(\psi,V)$ is an other chart s.t. $a\in V$ , then, $$f'(a)=\left.\frac{d}{dx}\right|_{x=\psi(a)}f(\psi^{-1}(x)).$$ The thing is that I don't see any reason to have $$\left.\frac{d}{dx}\right|_{x=\varphi (a)}f(\varphi ^{-1}(x))=\left.\frac{d}{dx}\right|_{x=\psi(a)}f(\psi^{-1}(x)).$$","['manifolds', 'derivatives']"
3222356,"Minimal Number of Monochromatic Edges in a ""under-colored"" Kneser Graph","Define the $n,k$ Kneser Graph $KN(n,k)$ as follows: $V=\binom{[n]}{k}$ and $ E=\{ (a,b) |a,b\in V, a\cap b = \emptyset\} $ .
In other words, the vertices are the $k$ -sets of an $n$ -element ground set and we connect them if they are disjoint. The Kneser–Lovász Theorem showed that $\chi(KN(n,k))=n-2k+2$ . Now define $\mu(n,k)$ to be the minimum number of monochromatic edges in $KN(n,k)$ colored with $n-2k+1$ colors (so one less color). I have already shown that $\mu(n,k)\leq\binom{2k-1}{k}$ . Essentially, I created $n-2k+2$ disjoint independent sets where the first $n-2k+1$ of them had the same smallest element and the last set just had all the rest. Then, I combined the last two independent sets and showed that the corresponding graph had at most $\binom{2k-1}{k}$ monochromatic edges. $\textbf{QUESTION:}$ I am struggling to show equality holds when (1) $k=2$ and (2) $n=2k+1$ . I fiddled around with it, but I was not able to find any leads on where the proof would be. Any help is greatly appreciated. \textbf{UPDATE:} I have been thinking about (1) for a bit and I speculate that it has to do with the Erdos-Ko-Rado Theorem that states that the largest family of $k$ element subsets of an $n$ -set such that each subset is pairwise intersecting has $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ sets. This means that the largest independent set in $KN(n,2)$ has size $\binom{n-1}{2-1}=n-1$ . To add a useful fact, each vertex is adjacent to the number of sets it is disjoint from, so $\binom{n-2}{2}$ sets.","['graph-theory', 'combinatorics', 'coloring']"
3222368,Example of function $g(x)$ s.t. $E(g|X_n|) \not\to 0$,"Consider the following result (assuming probability space ( $\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathsf P$ )) If $g : [0, \infty) \to [0,\infty)$ bounded, strictly increasing, $g(x) > 0$ for $x > 0$ and $\lim_{x \to 0^+}g(x) = 0$ , then $$X_n \to 0 \quad \text{in probability} \iff E(g(X_n)) \to 0.$$ I managed to prove this result. I am interested to see what happens if we relax some of the conditions needed for this result. In particular, when we relax boundedness we see that for $X_n(\omega) = n \mathbb {1}_{[0,1/n)}(\omega)$ we have that $X_n \to 0$ in probability but for $g(x) = x$ , we see that $$E(g(X)) = n \mathsf P(\{\omega \in [0,1/n)\}) = n(1/n) = 1 \not\to 0.$$ Here is where my question comes in: Can we find a $g$ and $(X_n)$ from above satisfying all the conditions except for strictly increasing , such that $$X_n \to 0 \quad \text{in probability but} \quad E(g(X_n)) \not\to0?$$","['measure-theory', 'examples-counterexamples', 'expected-value', 'convergence-divergence', 'probability-theory']"
3222371,Derivative of a quadratic form — how to derive it? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : How to take the gradient of the quadratic form? (6 answers) Closed 4 years ago . I want to know how $$\frac{\delta(x^TAx)}{\delta(x)}=2Ax$$ I think here's what happens (please correct me where wrong): (by: the rule for matrix derivative) $$
\frac{\delta(x^TAx)}{\delta(w)}=x^T(A^T+A)
$$ (by: I assume we can transpose matrices whenever we need to?) $$
x^T(A^T+A) = x^T(A^T+A^T) = x^T(2A^T)

3222405,"Determining eigenvalues of sum of 2 matrices, and then evaluating whether the limit exists","I'm studying for an exam on Tuesday and have been stumped on this question for a little while. Any hints or help at all would be appreciate! I'm given 2 matrices, $A$ and $R$ as shown below. I'm also given that the eigenvalues for matrix $A$ are: 4, 3, -3, & -2. I am then told to determine the eigenvalues of $C(\alpha, \beta) = \alpha A + \beta R$ , and thus determine when the limit $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} C(\alpha, \beta)^n$ exists, given that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both greater than 0. For the second part (determining when the limit exists), I think I have to use the rule that $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} C(\alpha, \beta)^n$ will only exist if the eigenvalues $\lvert \lambda\rvert < 1$ , so I imagine I'll have to set up some inequalities to do so. Any help is appreciated, since I've been stuck on this for over a day now! I've attempted to use the fact that the rank of matrix $R$ is 1, but I'm unsure how. $A$ : $$
    \begin{pmatrix}
    2 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
    2 & -1 & 3 & 0 \\
    2 & -1 & 2 & 1 \\
    -16 & 8 & 13 & -1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
$$ $R$ : $$
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
$$ EDIT: I realise that given the eigenvalues of A, the eigenvalues of $\alpha A$ will simply be the eigenvalues of A multiplied by $\alpha$ . Is this property true of all matrices? Or is it just because they have the same row sums? EDIT #2: I also realise that the eigenvalues of $A + R$ are 8, 3, -3, 2 i.e. the highest eigenvalue was multiplied by 2 while the rest remained the same. Similarly, eigenvalues of $A + 2R$ are 12, 3, -3, 2 and so on. I again fail to see why this is the case - would appreciate any pointers. EDIT #3: Based on the previous 2 edits, the eigenvalues for $C(\alpha, \beta) = \alpha A + \beta R$ will be: $4\alpha + 4\beta,  3\alpha,  -3\alpha,  -2\alpha$ . I figured this out by manually calculating the eigenvalues for the first couple of $\alpha's$ and $\beta's$ , however is there a trick I'm missing to simplifying this problem, since on the exam I don't think I'll be asked to compute the eigenvalues of a 4X4 matrix.","['limits', 'convergence-divergence', 'linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

Inserting $(2)$ in $(1)$ doesn't result in something useful though. Can this be done? Can $(3)$ be used as an alternative definition off twice-differentiability?

3222501,Understanding integration over Orthogonal Group,"Let $M$ be an $n \times n$ matrix, and $O_n$ be the orthogonal group of $n \times n$ matrix. Calculate $ m_1 = \int_{O_n}tr(M)dV$ and $m_2 = \int_{O_n} tr(M)^2dV$ where tr(M) is defined as the trace of M. I was given the answer key, but I don't quite understand it. The answer key made the following claims: "" Since the volume integral is invariant under translation in the
orthogonal group, it is invariant under permuting the coordinates, and under
multiplying a row or column by −1. We have $\int_{O_n} tr(M) dV =  \int_{O_n} \sum_i M_{ii}dV = n\int_{O_n}M_{11}dV = 0$ Also $\int_{O_n}tr(M)^2dV = \int_{O_n} (nM^2_{11} + (n^2 -n) M_{11} M_{22}dV = \int_{O_n} n M^2_{11}dV = \int_{O_n} \sum_i M^2_{1i}dV = \int_{O_n} 1dV$ "" I have very little understanding of this, specifically I don't understand the following: what it means by integrating over the orthogonal group Each step of $ \int_{O_n} \sum_i M_{ii}dV = n\int_{O_n}M_{11}dV = 0$ with these two, I think I can figure out the rest. I would really appreciate it if anyone can help me, thanks in advance. edit 1: So from my understanding so far, $O_n$ can be seen  as a set of point where the real_valued function, tr(M) is being integrated over. $M_{11}$ is integrated over $O_n$ as a constant function. I still don't quite understand the part about permuting the $i^{th}$ row and column of M to the first row and column is equal to $\int_{O_n} M_{11}dV$ If M is given by \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\c & d \end{bmatrix} then $\int_{O_2} tr(M)dV = \int_{O_2} (a + d) dV = 2 \int_{O_2} a dV$ ?
If so, then $2 \int_{O_2} a dV = 2 \int_{O_2} d dV = 2d \int_{O_2} dV  = 2a \int_{O_2} dV$ , then $a = d$ or $\int_{O_2} dV = 0$ ?","['integration', 'volume', 'differential-geometry']"

3222556,Proof that the inverse image of a single element is a discrete space,"Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be a local homeomorphism. I want to prove that, for each $y \in Y$ , the fiber $f^{-1}(y)$ is a discrete set, or discrete space (Is there any difference between these two last terms?). These are the posts I have read so far: Local homeomorphism and inverse image When is a local homeomorphism a covering map? Showing the fibre over a point in a covering map is a discrete space. How do I show that a topological space is discrete if all its subsets are closed? Show that in a discrete metric space, every subset is both open and closed. However, I have not been able to fully understand the proof. Some of the posts start the proof by mentioning that the fact that $f$ is a local homeomorphism implies that the fiber is finite; but I do not understand where does that come from, even after browsing MathSE and Wikipedia. Other posts try instead to prove that the fiber is finite, and they do so by first stating that the fiber is a discrete space. All of this make it look like circular reasoning, which does not make sense to me. If there is a concept I do not know, I am willing to visit places like Wikipedia or Subwiki.org ; however this time I have not been able to understand the proof even after reading many articles.

Therefore, I am interested in reducing them to (simpler) single integrals. If $f$ is Hölder continuous, i.e. $f \in C^{0,\alpha}([0,1])$ for some $\alpha \in (0,1]$ , the integrals in the following calculation exist and all manipulations are easy to justify ( $F$ is an arbitrary antiderivative of $f$ ): \begin{align}
D(f) &\equiv \int \limits_0^1 \int \limits_0^1 \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x-y} \, \text{d} x \, \text{d} y = 2 \int \limits_0^1 \int \limits_0^y \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x-y} \, \text{d} x \, \text{d} y \\
&= 2 \int \limits_0^1 \int \limits_0^y \frac{f(y) - f(y-t)}{t} \, \text{d} t \, \text{d} y = 2 \int \limits_0^1 \int \limits_t^1 \frac{f(y) - f(y-t)}{t} \, \text{d} y \, \text{d} t \\

&= 2 \int \limits_0^1 \log\left(\frac{t}{1-t}\right) f(t) \, \mathrm{d} t \equiv S(f) \, .
\end{align} However, this identity is also true for many less regular functions. The integral on the right-hand side exists for all $f$ in the weighted $L^1$ space $$A \equiv L^1 \left([0,1], \left\lvert\log \left(\frac{\cdot}{1-\cdot}\right)\right\rvert \lambda^1\right)$$ ( $\lambda^1$ is the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure). It contains the function $g \equiv t \mapsto \left(t-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-1}$ , for which we have $S(g) = \pi^2$ , while $D(g)$ does not exist. Therefore, I would like to find the set $$B = \{f \in A : D(f) \text{ exists and } D(f) = S(f)\} \subsetneq A$$ on which the above equation holds. In a first attempt, I have tried to work with $$ C \equiv L^1 \left([0,1], - \log \left[\cdot (1-\cdot)\right] \lambda^1\right) = L^1 ([0,1],\lambda^1) \cap A \, .$$ $f \in C$ has an absolutely continuous antiderivative, so we can work backwards to show $$ S(f) = 2 \int \limits_0^1 \int \limits_t^1 \frac{f(y) - f(y-t)}{t} \, \text{d} y \, \text{d} t \stackrel{?}{=} 2 \int \limits_0^1 \int \limits_0^y \frac{f(y) - f(y-t)}{t} \, \text{d} t \, \text{d} y \, ,$$ but I do not know how to justify changing the order of integration here. Tonelli's theorem does the trick for monotone functions, but according to numerical calculations $S(f) = D(f)$ holds for other $f \in C$ as well, which leaves me with the following questions: Can we prove that the order of integration may be changed or is there an alternative way to show that $C \subset B$ holds? (No! See edit.) What is the largest subset of $B$ (maybe even $B$ itself?) we can find? Some examples ( $\mathrm{G}$ is Catalan's constant): \begin{align}
D(\arctan) \stackrel{\text{Hölder cont.}}{=} S(\arctan) &= 2 \mathrm{G} - \frac{\pi^2}{16} - \frac{\pi}{4}\log(2) + \frac{1}{4} \log^2(2) \\
D(\log^3) \stackrel{\text{monotone}}{=} S(\log^3) &= 2 \pi^2 + \frac{2\pi^4}{15} + 12 \zeta(3)\\
D\left(t \mapsto \frac{\log(1-t)}{t^{3/2}}\right) \stackrel{?}{=} S\left(t \mapsto \frac{\log(1-t)}{t^{3/2}}\right) &= \frac{2\pi^2}{3} - 16 \log(2) (1 - \log(2))
\end{align} The last function is neither Hölder continuous nor monotone, so it is unclear whether the integrals are equal. Mathematica gives approximately $3.1754$ for the double integral as opposed to $3.1766$ for the single integral, so there is numerical evidence, but a proof would be better, obviously. Edit 26 April 2020 The answers to this question show that there are measurable sets $M \subset [0,1]$ whose indicator function $1_M$ lies in $C$ (obvious) but not in $B$ , since $$\int \limits_0^1 \int \limits_0^1 \frac{\lvert 1_M(x) - 1_M(y) \rvert}{\lvert x-y \rvert} \, \mathrm{d} x \, \mathrm{d} y = 2 \int \limits_{M \times M^\text{c}} \frac{\mathrm{d} x \, \mathrm{d} y}{\lvert x-y \rvert} = \infty \, .$$ This confirms fedja's comment and disproves $C \subset B$ , so the first question is obsolete.","['integration', 'multivariable-calculus', 'lebesgue-integral', 'definite-integrals']"

This would be possible once one broke down the integral into lots of little pieces, many of which would be in the forms $$\int_{\pi/4}^{3\pi/4}x^n\ln\sin x\,dx$$ or $$\int_0^{\pi/2}x^n\ln\cos x\,dx$$ or some other similar integrals. I figured that such generalizations would be fairly 'easy' once the general pattern was pinned down. My attempts are below. For starters, we see that $$\begin{align}

\end{align}$$ From this point on, we will be making heavy use of the Clausen functions $\mathrm{Cl}_s(z)$ . To evaluate $s_n$ , we will need to note that $\int\ln\sin x\,dx=-\frac12\mathrm{Cl}_2(2x)-x\ln2$ . With this in mind, we integrate by parts: $$\begin{align}
s_n&=-x^n\left(\frac12\mathrm{Cl}_2(2x)+x\ln2\right)\bigg|_{\pi/4}^{3\pi/4}+n\int_{\pi/4}^{3\pi/4}x^{n-1}\left(\frac12\mathrm{Cl}_2(2x)+x\ln2\right)dx\\

&=\alpha_n+\frac{n}{2^{n+1}}\int_{\pi/2}^{3\pi/2}x^{n-1}\mathrm{Cl}_2(x)dx\tag{1}
\end{align}$$ Where $\mathrm G$ is Catalan's constant. I know that the remaining integral can be tackled through repeated integration by parts: $$\begin{align}

\end{align}$$ Where $$f_m=\int_{\pi/2}^{3\pi/2}x^{m}\mathrm{Cl}_{n-m+1}(x)dx$$ Anyway, we have from integration by parts that $$f_j=\underbrace{(-1)^{n-j}\left(\frac\pi2\right)^{n-j}\left[3^j\mathrm{Cl}_{n-j+2}\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right)-\mathrm{Cl}_{n-j+2}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\right]}_{u_j}+\underbrace{(-1)^{n-j+1}j}_{v_j}f_{j-1}$$ And from here , we have $$f_j=f_0\prod_{k=1}^{j}v_k+\sum_{k=0}^{j-1}u_{j-k}\prod_{\ell=1}^{k}v_{j-\ell+1}$$ Which is $$f_j=(-1)^{\frac{j}2(2n-j+1)}j!f_0+n!\sum_{k=0}^{j-1}(-1)^{\frac{k(k+1)}2}\frac{u_{j-k}}{(n-k)!}$$ So $$f_{n-1}=(-1)^{\frac{(n-1)(n+2)}2}(n-1)!f_0+n!\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}(-1)^{\frac{k(k+1)}2}\frac{u_{n-k-1}}{(n-k-1)!}\tag{2}$$ Plugging $(2)$ into $(1)$ gives $s_n$ . As for closed forms, we may evaluate the $\mathrm{Cl}$ expressions in $u_j$ by noting that $$\mathrm{Cl}_{2n}\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right)=-\mathrm{Cl}_{2n}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=-\beta(2n)$$ and $$\mathrm{Cl}_{2n+1}\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right)=\mathrm{Cl}_{2n+1}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=\frac{1-2^{2n}}{2^{4n+1}}\zeta(2n+1)$$ Where $$\beta(s)=\sum_{k\geq0}\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)^s}$$ is the Dirichlet Beta function. As for $c_n$ , the process would probably be similar but way more nasty--which begs my question: Is there a more efficient/different way to evaluate $T_n$ ? Answers involving special functions (including hypergeometric functions) are welcome. Edit: Confirming my previous suspicions, we find (from integration by parts) that $$c_n=-\left(\frac\pi2\right)^{n+1}\frac{\ln2}{n+1}+\frac{n}{2^n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-1)^{n-k-1}{n-1\choose k}\pi^{n-k-1}g_k$$ Where $$g_k=\int_{\pi}^{2\pi}x^{k}\mathrm{Cl}_2(x)dx$$ Then from IBP again, $$g_k=\left(\frac34-2^k\right)\pi^k\zeta(3)+kd_{k-1}$$ where $$d_j=\int_\pi^{2\pi} x^j\mathrm{Cl}_{k-j+2}(x)dx$$ IBP again provides the (solvable) recurrence $$d_j=(-1)^{k-j+1}x^j\mathrm{Cl}_{k-j+3}(x)\bigg|_\pi^{2\pi}+(-1)^{k-j}jd_{j-1}$$ So, in effect, we have found a horrendous finite sum for $T_n$ . As for closed forms, we note that $$\mathrm{Cl}_{2m}(a\pi)=0\qquad a,m\in\Bbb Z, m\geq1$$ And $$\mathrm{Cl}_{2m+1}(2a\pi)=\zeta(2m+1)$$ $$\mathrm{Cl}_{2m+1}((2a+1)\pi)=(1-2^{-2m})\zeta(2m+1)$$ So after all, $$\begin{align}
T_n&=\frac32\left(\frac\pi2\right)^{n+1}\frac{\ln2}{n+1}+\frac{n}{2^n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-1)^{n-k}{n-1\choose k}\pi^{n-k-1}\left[\left(\frac34-2^k\right)\pi^k\zeta(3)+kd_{k-1}\right]\\
&+\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{n-k}{n\choose k}\left(\frac\pi4\right)^{n-k}\left[\alpha_k+\frac{k}{2^{k+1}}f_{k-1}\right]

3222702,Quartic as a product of quadratics,"The statement is Every degree $4$ polynomial with real coefficients is expressible as the product of two degree $2$ polynomials with real coefficients. This and much more general versions are of course simple consequences of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and there are of course numerous classical ways to even calculate all the roots of the quartic, thereby establishing much stronger statements constructively. However, suppose that we are only interested in proving the existence of such a factorisation and do not care about what the quadratics are. What's more, we want to do this for quartics only and there is no need for the argument to be applicable to polynomials of higher even degree. Do we still need an instance of the FTA and or a classical method that does this by working out all the coefficients? Or is there now a more elementary (perhaps purely existential) argument? Perhaps one justifying the expressibility of the quartic as the difference of two squared polynomials? This question is inspired by a similar question asked by a high school student and I am actually wondering if there is a proper proof of the above statement that is within the grasp of a high school student, i.e. no FTA, in fact no complex numbers at all, and no extensive calculations of roots/coefficients (and setting up four nonlinear equations simply by comparing coefficients falls into this class).","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials', 'alternative-proof']"

In both cases, $|h(z)|$ will be bounded, thus the set $C$ is bounded. For  the case of positive values and for $\varepsilon \geq 0 \; \exists \delta > 0 :$ \begin{align*}
|A| < \delta &\Rightarrow \int_A |u_2|\mathrm{d}x < \varepsilon \; \forall u_2 \in \Omega\\

One has $\chi_a ^2 = 1$ and $\chi_a \neq 1$ if $a \neq 1$ . The book states for the proof of the uniqueness part:
The uniqueness of $\chi_a$ is clear because all integers prime to $m$ are products of prime numbers not dividing $m$ . Why is this clear? I just don't see it.",['number-theory']

The following is a execise from Durrett's: Probability: Theory and Examples . Let $p>0$ .  Let $X_i$ be i.i.d random variables such that $EX_i =0$ , and define $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ . Show that if $\dfrac{S_n}{n^{1/p}}\to 0\,$ almost surely, then $E|X_i|^p < \infty$ . He says it's an easy exercise so I imagine there is a simple trick here. To start, I know that $$E|X_i|^p = \int_0^\infty P(|X_i|^p > x)dx = \int_0^\infty P(|X_i| > x^{1/p}) dx \leq 1+ \sum_{n=1}^\infty P(|X_n|>n^{1/p})$$ which I think might be helpful. I also think a contrapositive proof might be best? Suppose $E|X_i|^p = \infty$ . Then this implies $\sum_{n=1}^\infty P(|X_n|>n^{1/p}) = \infty$ . Since the $X_i$ 's are independent, the second Borel-Cantelli lemma then tells us: $$P(|X_n|>n^{1/p} \quad i.o) =  1.$$ And I think that this implies $S_n/n^{1/p}$ cannot converge to $0$ , since for the above implies $S_n/n^{1/p}>1$ infinitely often. Hence, giving the result by contrapositive. I'm really not confident with my probability theory.

Here $ \ P_m $ is a transition kernel from $\mathcal {F_1}\otimes \ldots \otimes \mathcal {F_{m-1 }} $ to $\mathcal F_m $ means that for every $B \in \mathcal {F_m }  , \ P_m( \ , B) $ is a measurable function from $\Omega_1 \times \ldots \times \Omega_{m-1 } $ to $[0,1]$ and for every $(\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_{m-1 } ) \in \Omega_1 \times \ldots \times \Omega_{m-1 } $ a probability  measure on $\mathcal {F_m}  $ . I would like to show that $$P(B)=\int P_1(d\omega_1) \int P_2(\omega_1,d \omega_2) \ldots \int 1_B(\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_n)P_n(\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_{n-1 } , d \omega_n)$$ defines a measure on $\Omega_1 \times \ldots\times \Omega_n $ This should be done by an argument using induction. That is one shows that $P$ is a countably additive set function on the set of measurable rectangles $B_0\times \ldots\times B_n$ (and then extend this set function by the usual arguments). To show countable additivity of $P $ on measurable rectangles we derive this for $n=1 $ and then extended the result to an arbitrary number $n$ with an argument using induction. And this inductive step is what I need help with. For the base case $n=1 $ one do as follows: First one shows that $\omega_1 \mapsto \int 1_B(\omega_1,\omega_2)P_2(\omega_1,d \omega _2)$ is $\mathcal F_1 $ measurable and this is done exactly as usually done in a first step in Fubini's theorem. Then noting that $$B \mapsto \int P_1(d \omega_1)\int 1_B(\omega_1,\omega_2)P_2(\omega_1,d \omega _2)$$ is nonnegative and monotone all we need to verify is the $\sigma $ -additivity. This follows from the monotone convergence theorem: \begin{align*}\int P_1(d \omega_1)\int 1_{\cup_{k=1}^{\infty }F_k} (\omega_1,\omega_2)P_2(\omega_1,d \omega _2) &=\int P_1(d \omega_1)\sum_{k=1 }^ {\infty } \int 1_{F_k} (\omega_1,\omega_2)P_2(\omega_1,d \omega _2) \\ &=\sum_{k=1 }^ {\infty }\int P_1(d \omega_1) \int 1_{F_k} (\omega_1,\omega_2)P_2(\omega_1,d \omega _2). \end{align*} And the inductive step should be something like : assume that $$Q(B)=\int P_1(d\omega_1) \int P_2(\omega_1,d \omega_2)\ldots\int 1_B(\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_{n-1 } )P_{n-2 } (\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_{n-2 } , d \omega_{n-1 } )$$ defines a measure on $\Omega_1 \times \ldots\times \Omega_{n-1 }$ then \begin{align*} & \int P_1(d\omega_1) \int P_2(\omega_1,d \omega_2)\ldots\int 1_{B_0 \times \ldots \times B_n}(\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_n)P_n(\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_{n-1 } , d \omega_n) \\ &=\int 1_{B_0 \times \ldots \times B_{n-1}}   \left(\int 1_{B_n } P_n(\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_{n-1 } , d \omega_n) \right) Q(d \omega_1,\ldots,d \omega_{n-1 } ) \end{align*} And we would then be in a similar situation as in the base case.

3223322,Is the ring $R$ a topological ring with respect to the following topology?,"Background This question is motivated by trying to answer this question . But before going into the question straight let me give some background. Definition 1. Let $R$ be a ring and $A$ be an ideal of $R$ . Let $\mathcal{T}_A$ denote the set of all semiprime ideals of $R$ containing $A$ . Then, $$\beta(A):=\bigcap_{Q\in \mathcal{T}_A}A$$ called the prime radical of $A$ . Let us now make the following definition, Definition 2. Let $R$ be a ring and $A\subseteq R$ . Let $\mathcal{T}_A$ denote the set of all semiprime ideals of $R$ containing $A$ . Then, $$\eta(A):=\bigcap_{Q\in \mathcal{T}_A}A$$ we call $\eta(A)$ to be the prime radical of $A$ in $R$ . We now note the following, Theorem 1. Let $R$ be a ring and $A\subseteq R$ . Let $\mathscr{P}(R)$ denote the power set of $R$ . Define, $\Phi:\mathscr{P}(R)\to \mathscr{P}(R)$ by, $$\Phi(A)=\eta(A)$$ Then, $A\subseteq \Phi(A)$ for all $A\in \mathscr{P}(R)$ $A\subseteq B\implies \Phi(A)\subseteq \Phi(B)$ for all $A,B\in \mathscr{P}(R)$ $\Phi(\Phi(A))=\Phi(A)$ for all $A\in \mathscr{P}(R)$ Each of the properties follows immediately from Definition 2 . Consequently we claim that the operator $\Phi$ is a closure operator on $R$ . So, it generates a topology on $R$ . Denote this topological space by $(R,\tau)$ and call this space (for the time being) the prime radical space of $R$ , the topology being prime radical topology on $R$ . Question Is $(R,+,\cdot)$ a topological ring with respect to the prime radical topology?

I am trying to calculate the conditional expectation $$E(h(X_1,\ldots,X_n) | X_{(n)} = x)\tag{1}$$ but I get stuck on the density.

Note that if $X_1$ were discrete we could simply write $$E(h(X_1,\ldots,X_n) | X_{(n)} = x) \\
= \sum_{x_1,\ldots,x_n:x_{(n)} = x} h(x_1,\ldots,x_n) Pr(X_1=x_1,\ldots,X_n=x_n, X_{(n)}=x)/Pr(X_{(n)}=x)\\

In addition to the properties mentioned above I know that $h$ is symmetric in all components, that is $h(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = h(x_{\pi(1)},\ldots,x_{\pi(n)})$ for all permutations $\pi$ of $n$ letters.

I know the Perron eigenvalue is $7$ so was able to find the eigenvectors to be $$ v = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \ w^{T} =\begin{pmatrix} \frac{5}{9} & \frac{2}{3} & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$ The next part asks: Find a rank $1$ non negative matrix C such that the matrix $B+C$ will have eigenvalues $13,2,-1$ . I know from a theorem I've done in class that since $C$ is a rank $1$ matrix it can be expressed as $vy^{T}$ such that $B+C$ has the same eigenvalues as $B$ except that $\lambda_{1}$ of $B$ is replaced by $\lambda_{1} +y^{T}v$ . In this example then I have let $y = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \end{pmatrix}^{T}$ and from this I have $13 = 7 + \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ , therefore $a + b + c = 6$ .

3223465,Is the circle homeomorphic to a $6$ petal rose?,"I am trying to explain that a circle is homeomorphic to a $6$ -petal rose with the standard topology of $\mathbb R^2$ , for that i'll need to explain (just in words, it is not necessary to come up with a formula) the homeomorphic function that maps one into the other. So starting from the center of the rose, a series of continous changes can start to push neighboring points of the rose to the border of the circle, in the end every point should be at an equal $r$ distance from the center of the rose. The same thing goes for the inverse, starting with six equidistance points in the circumference, a series of continous chanages should push the their neighboing points following the trajectory of the petals to the center of the flower. The map and the inverse should be continous because an arbitrary open ball of a certain radius in one figure, should be map to another open ball of a certain radius in the other one. The problem is in the center of the flower where the points converge, there is no simil open set in the circle, would that mean that there is no bijection relationship between their topologies?, even though they both share the same. Is the open ball at the center of the flower different from the other ones?, so despite that the and its inverse are continous, it is not homeomorphic?, or the function is not continous?.

3223633,Area under the curve - Integrals (Antiderivatives),"I have a question regarding antiderivatives and area under the curve. I've learned that first, you must to a graph to see if the area is above or below the curve. If it is above the $x$ -axis the area is ""positive"" and I must use $A=\int f(x) dx $ . If it is below the $x$ -axis the area is ""negative"" and I must use $A=-\int f(x) dx $ . In this last one, I've understood that negative outside the integral is because the integration alone will be negative because is under $x$ -axis, but an area can't be negative so that's why is multiply by that negative. I've also seen this with absolute value $A=|\int f(x) dx| $ that I think have the same purpose. This is an example of an exercise: Determine the area of the region bounded by the curve of the function $f(x)=4x^3-16x$ the $x$ -axis and the lines $x=-2$ y $x=2$ . Ok. I'll show you my work. I first do the graph. I see that between $-2$ and $0$ the region bounded is above the $x$ -axis so is positive, and that between $0$ and $2$ the region bounded is below the $x$ -axis so is negative. So I'll call the first one $A_1$ and the second $A_2$ . $$A_{total}=\int_{-2}^2 (4x^3-16x) dx$$ $$A_{total}=A_1+A_2$$ $$A_{total}=\int_{-2}^0 f(x) dx+(-\int_0^2 f(x) dx)$$ $$A_{total}=\int_{-2}^0 (4x^3-16x) dx+(-\int_0^2 (4x^3-16x) dx)$$ $$A_{total}=[\frac{4x^4}{4}-\frac{16x^2}{2}]|^{0}_{-2} - [\frac{4x^4}{4}-\frac{16x^2}{2}]|^{2}_{0} $$ $$A_{total}=[x^4-8x^2]|^{0}_{-2} - [x^4-8x^2]|^{2}_{0} $$ $$A_{total}=[((0)^4-8(0)^2)-((-2)^4-8(-2)^2)]-[((2)^4-8(2)^2)-((0)^4-8(0)^2)]$$ $$A_{total}=[-(16-32)]-[16-32]$$ $$A_{total}=[-(-16)]-[-16]$$ $$A_{total}=16+16$$ $$A_{total}=32u^2$$ So I got that the total area is 32 square units.

3224017,Applications of the $\frac{5}{8}$ Theorem,"The 5/8 theorem for compact groups says the following: Theorem (5/8 Theorem for Compact Groups) Let $G$ be a compact Hausdorff topological group with Haar measure $\mu$ . If $G$ is not abelian then the probability that two elements of $G$ commute is at most $5/8$ . More precisely, if $G$ is not abelian then $$(\mu \times \mu)(\{(g,g') \in G \times G : [g,g'] = e\}) \leq 5/8.$$ If you don't care or already know how this is proved, skip down the page, past the next horizontal rule. Lemma 1. Let $G$ be a compact Hausdorff topological group with a Borel subgroup $H$ . Let $\mu$ be the Haar measure on $G$ . Then $\mu(H) = 1/[G:H]$ (this is $0$ by convention when $[G:H]$ is infinite). Proof of Lemma 1: The cosets of $H$ partition $G$ , and all have the same measure by translation-invariance of $\mu$ . If there are finitely many cosets, the result follows directly from additivity of $\mu$ . If there are infinitely many cosets, suppose for contradiction that $\mu(H) > 0$ , and pick any sequence $(C_n)_{n \geq 0}$ of distinct cosets of $H$ . Then $$1 = \mu(G) \geq \mu\left(\bigcup_{n \geq 0} C_n\right) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \mu(C_n) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \mu(H) = \infty,$$ a contradiction. Lemma 2. Let $G$ be a group such that $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic. Then $G$ is abelian. Proof of Lemma 2: Let $g \in G$ such that $gZ(G)$ generates $G/Z(G)$ . Let $x,y \in G$ be arbitrary. Then $x \in g^nZ(G)$ , $y \in g^mZ(G)$ for some $n,m \in \mathbb{Z}$ . Write $x = g^n z$ , $y = g^m z'$ for some $z, z' \in Z(G)$ . Since $g$ , $z$ , and $z'$ pairwise commute, $x$ and $y$ commute. Proof of Theorem: Let $$X = \{(g,g') \in G \times G : [g,g'] = e\} = \{(g,g') \in G \times G : g' \in Z(g)\},$$ where $Z(g)$ denotes the centralizer of $g$ in $G$ . By Fubini's Theorem, the measure of $X$ (which we aim to show is at most $5/8$ ) equals $\int_G \mu(Z(g)) \; \mathrm{d}\mu(g)$ . The center of $G$ (which we will denote by $Z$ ) is closed, since it can be written the intersection of closed sets $\bigcap_{g \in G} Z(g)$ ( $Z(g)$ is the inverse image of $\{e\}$ under the continuous map $x \mapsto xgx^{-1} : G \to G$ ). Thus, $$\begin{multline*}\mu(X) = \int_G \mu(Z(g)) \;\mathrm{d}\mu(g) = \int_Z \mu(Z(g)) \;\mathrm{d}\mu(g) + \int_{G \setminus Z} \mu(Z(g)) \;\mathrm{d}\mu(g)\\
= \mu(Z) + \int_{G \setminus Z} \mu(Z(g)) \;\mathrm{d}\mu(g).\end{multline*}$$ If $g \in G\setminus Z$ then $Z(g) \neq G$ , so $[G : Z(g)] \geq 2$ , so $\mu(Z(g)) \leq 1/2$ by Lemma 1. This means that $$\mu(X) \leq \mu(Z) + \frac{1}{2}\mu(G \setminus Z) = \mu(Z) + \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \mu(Z)\right) = \frac{\mu(Z) + 1}{2}.$$ By Lemma 2, we must have $[G : Z] \geq 4$ (or else $G/Z$ would be cyclic), so by Lemma 1 again, we have $\mu(Z) \leq 1/4$ . Therefore, $\mu(X) \leq 5/8$ , as desired. Corollary (5/8 Theorem for Finite Groups) Let $G$ be a finite group. If the probability that two randomly chosen elements of $G$ commute is greater than $5/8$ , then $G$ is abelian. My question is this: Are there any interesting applications of this result? Interesting examples may include: A finite (or compact) group which is not obviously abelian, but for which it is relatively easy to prove that elements commute with probability >5/8. A non-abelian group which has no compact Hausdorff topology making it into a topological group because ""too many pairs of elements commute"" (i.e. a proof by contradiction that no such topology exists, using the result of the 5/8 Theorem). These are the kinds of applications I was able to imagine, but there are probably many others; I'd be interested to hear if anyone has come across any application of the 5/8 Theorem!","['measure-theory', 'big-list', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'probability']"

3224510,Function that maps strings from one formal language into string of another formal language?,"Is there branch of mathematics and mathematical theories, that considers mappings from strings of one language into strings of another formal language? Example. Let's consider two languages that can be used for syntax of two different logics and that can implement the formal semantics of natural language. One language uses the predicate approach to the modalities https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319225562 and defer the inference about modalities till the reasoning time. The example of legal sentence in this language is: believes(John, in_conservatives) Other language uses the modalities in the form of modal operators as the first class citizens of the logic and now all the non-logical information about the notion ""believe"" is encoded in the axioms for the modal operator Belief_Diamond_(agent)(predicate) and hence, the sentence becomes in this language: Belief_Diamond_(John)(in_conservatives) So - I just had hopes that there is some theory, methods, best practices about translation from the first language into the second language (e.g. in the case when one decides to fix the notion of ""belief"" and one wishes to investigate it using the methods of logic). Of course, as a programmer, I have no problem to make program, that parses the first sentence into the abstract syntax tree, then do some manipulation in this syntax tree (AST) or maybe event do mapping into the syntax tree of another language and then output the other language sentence. So - essentially - this is the question about mapping from the AST of one language to the AST of another language .

3224764,Why is the definition of inductive set well defined?,"I've been studying from Enderton's Mathematical Introduction to Logic in which he defines an inductive set as follows: To simplify our discussion, we will consider an initial set $B \subseteq U$ and a class $F$ of functions containing just two members $f$ and $g$ , where $f:U×U→U$ and $g:U→U$ .
  Thus $f$ is a binary operation on $U$ and $g$ is a unary operation. (Actually $F$ need not be finite; it will be seen that our simplified discussion here is, in fact, applicable to a more general situation. $F$ can be any set of relations on $U$ , and in Chapter 2 this greater generality will be utilized. But the case discussed here is easier to visualize and is general enough to illustrate the ideas. For a less restricted version, see Exercise 3.)
  If $B$ contains points $a$ and $b$ , then the set $C$ we wish to construct will contain, for example, $b, f (b, b), g(a), f (g(a), f (b, b)), g( f (g(a), f (b, b)))$ .
  Of course these might not all be distinct. The idea is that we are given certain bricks to work with, and certain types of mortar, and we want $C$ to contain just the things we are able to build. In defining $C$ more formally, we have our choice of two definitions. We can define it “from the top down” as follows: Say that a subset $S$ of $U$ is closed under $f$ and $g$ iff whenever elements $x$ and y belong to $S$ , then so also do $f(x,y)$ and $g(x)$ .Say that $S$ is inductive iff $B \subseteq S$ and $S$ is closed under $f$ and $g$ . Let $C^*$ be the intersection of all the inductive subsets of $U$ ; thus $x \in C^*$ iff $x$ belongs to every inductive subset of $U$ . It is not hard to see (and the reader should check) that $C^*$ is itself inductive. Furthermore, $C^*$ is the smallest such set, being included in all the other inductive sets. The second (and equivalent) definition works “from the bottom up.” We want $C_*$ to contain the things that can be reached from $B$ by applying $f$ and $g$ a finite number of times. Temporarily define a construction sequence to be a finite sequence $<x_1, . . . , x_n>$ of elements of $U$ such that
  for each $i \leq n$ we have at least one of $x_i \in B$ , $x_i=f(x_j,x_k)$ for some $j<i,k<i$ , $x_i =g(x_j)$ for
  some $j<i$ . In other words, each member of the sequence either is in B or results from earlier members by applying f or g. Then let C be the set of all points x such that some construction sequence ends with x. I am confused as in other texts I've read an inductive set to be defined in a similar fashion to as follows from Enderton's Elements of Set Theory : A set $A$ is said to be inductive iff $\emptyset \in A$ and it is ""closed under successor,"" i.e., $(\forall a \in A) a^+ \in a$ or similarly for For Natural Numbers What confuses me most is that by just defining an inductive set as such "" $S$ is inductive iff $B \subseteq S$ and $S$ is closed under $f$ and $g$ "" doesnt that lead to inductive sets such as $\{1,2,3,4\}$ where $f$ and $g$ can be sent to map all to the same element $1$ . What is the advantage to this type of definition for induction and how is it consistent with other definition. Using this definition of induction how may one say that the natural numbers are an inductive set any more than my finite set above. What is the intuition in this definition?

3224834,Definition of a locally lifted measure,"I have just begun studying $g$ -measures, and thought it a good idea to study Keane's paper [1], where they were first introduced. However, I almost immediately stumbled upon a concept I am not familiar with, which is crucial to understanding the motivation for the rest of the paper. The setting is as follows: Let $(X,T)$ be a dynamical system, where $X$ is a compact metric space $(X,d)$ , and $T$ is a minimal covering transformation. By this we (read Keane) mean that: $T$ is everywhere $n$ -to-1 ( $n\geq 2$ ). $T$ is a local homeomorphism. There exists a $C>1$ , such that for all $x\in X$ there exists a $\delta_x>0$ , such that $d(x,y)<\delta_x\implies d(Tx,Ty)\geq Cd(x,y)$ . For all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $N\in\mathbb N$ , such that $T^{-N}(x)$ is $\varepsilon$ dense in $X$ , for all $x$ . Now comes the concept I am not familiar with: Keane states that, for any measure $\mu$ on $X$ we can denote the measure on $X$ ""obtained by lifting $\mu$ locally by $T^{-1}$ by $Q\mu$ "". What exactly is this $Q\mu$ ? My first thought was that $Q\mu$ was simply the pushforward $T_*\mu$ (defined by $T_\mu(A)=\mu(T^{-1}(A)))$ , which agrees with his next line: ""The total mass of $Q\mu$ is $n$ times that of $\mu$ "". However this is a global construction, and so does not lend itself to the use of the word ""local"". My other thought is that $T$ being a minimal covering transformation allows us to construct a partition $X=\bigsqcup_{i=1}^nX_i$ , where for each $i$ , $T|_{X_i}$ is a homeomorphism. Let us denote each such restricted function by $T_i$ . We can then define $Q\mu$ by $$Q\mu(A)=\sum_{i=1}^n\mu(T_i(A\cap X_i)).$$ This is most probably my best guess as to how $Q\mu$ is supposed to be defined, but I haven't proven rigorously yet that $T$ being a covering transformation allows such a decomposition (but it seems entirely natural that it should). I will be very appreciative if someone can definitively tell me what the correct definition of $Q\mu$ should be. [1] Keane, Michael , Strongly mixing g-measures , Invent. Math. 16, 309-324 (1972).

\end{align}$$ I eventually want to simplify this expression to $$\sum\limits_{1k_1+2k_2+\cdots+nk_n+(n+1)k_{n+1}=n+1}\frac{(n+1)!}{k_1!\cdots k_n!k_{n+1}!}f^{(k_1+\cdots+k_n+k_{n+1})}(g(x))\prod\limits_{j=1}^{n+1}\left(\frac{g^{(j)}(x)}{j!}\right)^{k_j}$$ I noticed that the first term of the right hand side of my last step is equivalent to that simplified sum under the restriction that $k_1\ge 1$ except it is missing a factor of $n+1$ . The $nth$ term of the sum from $j=1$ to $n$ on the right hand side exactly matches the term on the simplified version where $k_{n+1}=1$ and the other $k_j's$ are $0$ . The remaining terms of the sum (i.e. the terms for $j=1$ to $j=n-1$ ) correspond to a relative increase in $k_{j+1}$ by $1$ and relative decrease in $k_j$ by $1$ , with the exception of a missing factor of $\frac{n+1}{(k+1)k_k}$ . I am not sure how to address these missing factors and particuticularly how to rewrite the terms from $j=1$ to $n-1$ of the sum of the right hand side. I tested my work for $n=2$ and the two expressions were equivalent. This makes me think my work is correct so far I just don't know how to proceed.

3224872,"Show that $\min\{X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}\}$ is sufficient for $\mu$ when $\sigma$ is fixed","Let $X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}$ be a sample from a population with density $p(x,\theta)$ given by \begin{align*}
p(x,\theta) = \frac{1}{\sigma}\exp\left\{-\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)\right\}
\end{align*} if $x\geq \mu$ and $0$ otherwise. Here $\theta = (\mu,\sigma)$ with $-\infty < \mu < \infty$ and $\sigma > 0$ . (a) Show that $\min\{X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}\}$ is sufficient for $\mu$ when $\sigma$ is fixed. (b) Find a one-dimensional sufficient statistic for $\sigma$ when $\mu$ is fixed. (c) Exhibit a two-dimensional sufficient statistic for $\theta$ . MY ATTEMPT (b) In the first place, let us determine the maximum likelihood function for this sample considering that $\mu$ is fixed: \begin{align*}
L(\textbf{x},\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{\sigma}\exp\left\{-\left(\frac{x_{i}-\mu}{\sigma}\right)\right\} = \frac{1}{\sigma^{n}}\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{\sigma}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} - n\mu\right)\right\}
\end{align*} In this case, we can factor $L(\textbf{x},\theta) = h(x)g_{\sigma}(T(\textbf{x}))$ , where \begin{align*}
h(x) = 1\quad\text{and}\quad g_{\sigma}(T(\textbf{x})) = \frac{1}{\sigma^{n}}\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{\sigma}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} - n\mu\right)\right\}
\end{align*} Therefore the statistic $T(\textbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$ is sufficient for $\sigma$ . But I do not know if this is right neither do I know how to approach the other two items. Can somebody help me out? Thanks in advance!","['self-learning', 'statistics', 'statistical-inference', 'maximum-likelihood']"
