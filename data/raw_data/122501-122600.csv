1843458,Local sections of $\mathcal{O}(1)$,"Let $\mathcal{O}(-1)$ be the tautological bundle over $\mathbb{P}^n$ and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ its dual bundle, also known as the hyperplane bundle. I know that there is a bijection between $\Gamma(\mathbb{P}^n,\mathcal{O}(1))$ and $\mathbb{C}[z_0,\dots,z_n]_1$, the set of homogeneus degree $1$ polynomials in $n+1$ variables. In fact, I think that given any two sections defined over two different affine open sets of $\mathbb{P}^n$ that glue are also defined by one of these polynomials. So my question is, what can we say about a section only defined in one of the affine open sets? Can these sections be arbitrary or are they also determined by a linear functional? Edit: MooS already provided a great answer for the algebraic geometric case. Yet, I forgot to mention in the OP that I'm looking for a holomorphic approach to the problem. Edit 2: In fact, given any affine open set $U_i$ of $\mathbb{P}^n$ it would be enough for me to know how the sections $\mathcal{O}(1)(U_i)$ look in the holomorphic setting. MooS' answer makes me think that these sections should be of the form $\frac{f(z_0,\dots,z_n)}{z_i^{\operatorname{deg}f-1}}$, for $f$ an homogeneous polynomial, just as in the algebraic setting, yet I don't know how to show it. For example, in $U_i$ a section $s$ is defined by a function $\tilde{s}:\mathbb{C}^n\to\mathbb{C}$ so that $$s([z])=([z],\tilde{s}(z_0/z_i,\dots,z_n/z_i)).$$ Taking the series expansion of $\tilde{s}$ naturally yields a homogeneous polynomial as long as it's finite. And even in this case we end up with something of the form $\frac{g(z_0,\dots,z_n)}{z_i^{\operatorname{deg g}}}$ for $g$ a homogeneous polynomial.

1843468,Why do we need axiom of choice for this?,"The answerers on this question say that we need AoC (or some variant thereof) to prove that every infinite set has a countably infinite subset. In my view, choice is not needed but the answerers are much more experienced than me so now I'm not sure. For $S$ an infinite set we have $\aleph_0 \leq |S|$. Thus there exists an injection $f:\mathbb{N} \to S$. Let $I$ denote the image set and note $f:\mathbb{N} \to I$ is a bijection. Hence $I \subset S$ is countably infinite.

$$\int f_{n_k}g\rightarrow\int fg $$
for all $g\in L^q$ (where $1/p+1/q=1$). The corresponeding result for $p=1$ is not true, as $L^1$ is not reflexive.'' I'm working in $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. If $f\in L^1(\Omega)$, then $f:L^{\infty}(\Omega)\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ defined by $f(g)=\int_{\Omega} fg$ is a bounded linear operator. Also, the norm of $f$ as a function coincides with the norm of $f$ as an operator by taking $$g(x)=\begin{cases} |f(x)|/f(x),\,f(x)\neq0 \\ 0,\,f(x)=0 \end{cases}\in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$$ (note that $fg=|f|$). Then, by Banach-Alaoglu Theorem, if $(f_n)\subseteq L^1(\Omega)$ is bounded, there exists a subsequence $f_{n_k}$ and $f\in L^1(\Omega)$ with $\int f_{n_k}g\rightarrow\int fg$ for all $g\in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$.

$$
f(n)=\sum_{i=0}^n\frac{\lfloor \sqrt{i}\rfloor+\lfloor \sqrt{n-i}\rfloor}{2}\binom{n}{i}

And the a bit naive approximation 
$$
\frac{\lfloor \sqrt{i}\rfloor+\lfloor \sqrt{n-i}\rfloor}{2}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\lfloor \sqrt{i}\rfloor}=\frac{n\lfloor \sqrt{n}\rfloor-\frac{1}{6}\lfloor \sqrt{n}\rfloor\left(\lfloor \sqrt{n}\rfloor-1\right)\left(2\lfloor \sqrt{n}\rfloor+5\right)}{n}\approx\frac{2}{3}\sqrt{n}

1843623,Map of tangent spaces is the Jacobian in Algebraic Geometry,"I need your collected brainpower to help me out. This is going to be long, so grab your favorite beverage and snack. I am working through GÃ¶rtz and Wedhorn's ""Algebraic Geometry I""  and I am currently at chapter 6, more specifically the tangent space definition. So they are giving the ""usual"" definition of the tangent space of a scheme $X$ at a point $x$ by $$ T_xX:=(\mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2)^*. $$ Now let $f:X\to Y$ be a morphism of schemes, than we have a map $f_x^\sharp:\mathcal{O}_{Y,f(x)}\to \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ which induces a $k(x)$-linear map from $\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}/\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}^2\otimes_{k(f(x))}k(x) \to \mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2$. Dualizing this map gives us a map on tangent spaces which we denote: $$ df:T_xX \to T_{f(x)}Y\otimes_{k(f(x))}k(x). $$ For those of you who have the book in front of you: I'm now particularly interested in Example 6.4 and there especially the second part which is as following: Let $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ be the affine space over a field $k$. Here the authors don't make any restriction on the field. This is going to be important to my question. Now let $f:\mathbb{A}^n\to \mathbb{A}^r$ be a map given by polynomials $f_1,\ldots,f_r \in k[T_1,\ldots,T_n]$ and let $x\in \mathbb{A}^n_k(k)$ be a rational point. Then the map $df_x$ is given by the Jacobian: $$ \left( \dfrac{\partial f_i}{\partial T_j} \right)_{i,j}. $$ Here is my attempt to confirm this: first of all I think the authors secretly assume that $k$ is algebraicly closed because they assume that $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ and the associated maximal ideal is $(T_1-x_1,\ldots,T_n-x_n)$. Now let's assume this and look how the maps work. The induced map on the coordinate rings is \begin{eqnarray}
f^\sharp:k[Y_1,\ldots,Y_r] &\to & k[T_1,\ldots,T_n]\\
g &\mapsto & g(f_1,\ldots,f_r),
\end{eqnarray}
(I hope the notation is clear). Now going to the stalks is just localizing at the respective maximal ideals which are $(T_1-x_1,\ldots,T_n-x_n)=:\mathfrak{m}_x$ and $(Y_1-b_1,\ldots,Y_r-b_r)=:\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}$ where $b=f(x)$. I will abuse notation a little bit here, so $\mathfrak{m}_x,\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}$ will also denote the maximal ideals in the stalk. I think this is justified since they really are the maximal ideals under the injection given by localization. Now the induced map on the stalk level doesn't look different from the map on the coordinate rings and since we are particularly interested in how the maps work on the maximal ideals we check this for generators of $\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}$. We can figure that the map there works as following: \begin{eqnarray}
f^\sharp_x:\mathfrak{m}_{f(x)}&\to &\mathfrak{m}_{x}\\
Y_i-f_i(x) &\mapsto & f_i-f_i(x)
\end{eqnarray} Now comes the interesting part and my actual question. To describe the actual map I will use the Taylor-polynomial of $f_i$ which is: \begin{eqnarray} T_nf_i(x,T)&=&f_i(x)+\langle (gradf_{i})_x,(T-x)\rangle+\mathfrak{m}_x^2 \\
&=&f_i(x)+\sum_{i=1}^n \dfrac{\partial f_i}{\partial T_i}(x)(T_i-x_i)+\mathfrak{m}_x^2 .
 \end{eqnarray}
Now comes the part that bothers me: Using that $f_i(T)=T_nf_i(x,T)$ I get that $f_i-f_i(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n \dfrac{\partial f_i}{\partial T_i}(x)(T_i-x_i)+\mathfrak{m}_x^2 $ and so by passing to the quotient $\mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x^2$ I can see how the map works and figure out that the map $df$ is indeed the Jacobian matrix. So here is my question: My argument relies on the identity $$ f_i(T)=T_nf_i(x,T) $$ for some large enough $n$. I know that this is true for $k=\mathbb{C}$ (and therefore for any subfield) but why should this be true for any other field? In particular you have to be very carefully in even defining this in positiv characteristic. Does anybody know about this? Or alternatively: Is there another argument to see that $df$ is given by the Jacobian which doesn't involve the Taylor expansion?","['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1843650,Languages acceptable with just a single final state,"For a given regular language $L$ we can always find a corresponding automaton with exactly one initial state, this is quite a common result and in most textbooks even non-deterministic automata are just allowed to have a single start state. Now I am curious under what conditions is a single final state sufficient. Of course, sometimes a single final state is not enough (even for non-deterministic automata), for example for the language $L = \{a, bb\}$ or $L = a \cup bb^{\ast}$ (of course under the assumption that $\varepsilon$-transition are not allowed). I guess if we allow multiple initial states in non-deterministic automata, then we can always find a non-deterministic automata with a single final state (it might have multiple start states). For a proof, if $L$ is regular, then let $\mathcal A$ be an accepting automaton for $L^R$ (i.e. the mirrored language) with a single initial state $q_0$. Then reverse all transitions and declare $q_0$ to be its single final state, and all original final states as initial states, and we have an automaton for $(L^R)^R = L$ which has just a single final state. So is this observation correct, or are there automata for which we always need more than one final state, even if we allow multiple start states. And also could the languages which could be accepted with just a single final state (in the deterministic, and in the non-deterministic with a single initial state) somehow characterised? Also note that $L = X^{\ast}0X$ for $X = \{0,1\}$ could not be accepted by a DEA with a single final state, but by an NEA with a single final state and a single initial state. EDIT: A straightforward characterisation for the deterministic case, as the number of nerode right-congruence classes whose union is $L$ is an upper bound for the number of final states (as they could not be further merged), we have that $L$ could be accepted by such an automaton iff it is itself an equivalence class. This also shows that by adding final states we could not gain anything in the sense that the automaton gets smaller.","['combinatorics', 'formal-languages', 'automata']"

Originally I've seen this question on an exam but it was stated only for the case $ k = n = 1 $ and $f$ surjective, which made it really easy to show $f$ can't be continuous, by using the Weierstrass extreme value theorem. A very similar argument seem to work for any $k$, as long as $n=1$. However, for general $k$ and $n$ this seems much harder. I don't see how surjectivity affects this problem, so I've dropped this assumption for now. Edit:Slup commented below, showing the relevance of surjectivity for this question. Induction on $n$ and looking at projections of $f$ onto individual coordinates seemed tempting at first, but the composition of $f$ with a projection seems to lose any traces of the property that the inverse image of a point = exactly two points, so I don't see how this could be useful. Trying to visualise this for $k=n=2$, it intuitively seems that in order to transform the space in this way, we would have to 'tear' it along some curve. For bigger $k = n$, that becomes 'tearing' along some $n-1$ dimensional manifold, but that's obviously completely informal, sort of useless and I completely have no idea how this idea could be translated into a formal proof. Bonus question: Does the answer or the proof change in a significant way if we limit the domain to $ f:\overline{\mathbb{B}^k} \to \mathbb{R}^n $?

1843910,convention of a default atlas,"Recently, I have been studying the basics of differential geometry and te necessary preliminaries. I arrived at the construction of differential structure on topological manifolds, where the non-uniqueness of these structures is mentioned. After this, the precence of a (pick of) structure seems to be assumed in most of what follows. From what I can tell, it often looks like there is an obvious choice, while the others are labled 'exotic'. This seems to be most obvious when looking at $\mathbb{R^4}$ . There is an entire wikipedia page dedicated to exotic versions of $\mathbb{R^4}$ , that are homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R^4}$ as a smooth manifold. My question then becomes: when no differential structure is given, is there a convention of a structure to pick? How do I distinguish between the exotic structures and the 'usual' ones. In the case of $\mathbb{R^4}$ , I would bet the default structure would/could consist of an atlas, build from all of the open sets, equipped with the identity from $\mathbb{R^4}$ into $\mathbb{R^4}$ . As my background is in physics, I am in particular interested in the differential structure that one would usually establish on a manifold in the context of four dimentional General Relativity. But perhaps this should be a sepparate question on the physics SE. I apologize in advance for improper use of jargon or other, possibly trivial mistakes. Feel free to correct me. edit To further clairify the source of this question as well as my confusion:
From my experience with GR it seems physicists usually take a (pseudo?) Riemanian metric as a starting point. To me it seems this fixes only a piece of the manifold, described by the single coordinate map. The physicist would then declare that this describes a manifold, but i am uncertain how to pick the additional contributions to the atlas. On top of this, the physicist might sometimes perform a coordinate transformation, which seems tricky to me when the rest of the chart was not well comunicated. How would I know if the new coordinates would be in the same chart? In addition, I am uncertain weither this should be discussed here, or on the physiscs SE. edit 2 I will ay some point pose a related question about GR on the physics SE. The question then reduces to one of mathematical convention: weither or not $\mathbb{R}^n$ is usually assumed to be equipped with the identity on open sets, as an atlas, and weither or not other 'assumptions' exist when the atlas definition is left out. edit 3 new related thread in physics SE https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/566643/how-to-select-which-differentiable-manifold-to-use-to-model-spacetime/661820","['differential-geometry', 'convention']"
1843926,Boundary of a metric space,"Does it make sense to talk about boundary of a metric space, not of subset? For example, if $E$ is the metric space consisting of the closed interval $ [ 0,1] $ with the usual metric of $\mathbb{R}$, then is $ \{0,1 \}$ the boundary points of $E$? I kinda think not, since a boundary point of a set A is defined to be the point where any neighborhood of that point contain some point in A and some point not in A.  But in my example above, any neighborhood of the point $0$ and $1$ only contain point in $E$. I'm new to topology so can anyone enlighten me about this? thank you very much.

Now suppose that the forms $\omega$ and $\sigma$ have just one zero of multiplicity $2g-2$ in the same point. From $\omega$ and $\sigma$ we get a well defined function $\theta:R\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ which locally is defined as $\frac f g$. My question is: is $\theta$ a holomorphic function? I think yes, because $f$ and $g$ have a zero of the same multiplicity in the same point, so $\theta$ should have no poles.. but then this means that $\theta$ should be a constant function.. So this implies that every two holomorphic 1-forms on $R$ with one zero of multiplicity $2g-2$ in the same point differ by a constant? This doesn't seem right because this would mean that the complex vector space of holomorphic forms with one zero of multiplicity $2g-2$ in a fixed point should have dimension 1 which is impossible..

1844058,Converse of Schur's Lemma in finite dimensional vector spaces,"I am trying to prove (or disprove) the converse of Schur's Lemma in finite dimensional vector spaces. I am not sure if it holds in this case, but I have tried to apply the idea that proves it in representation theory (see for example Theorem 4.3 here that uses Maschke's theorem or in questions here and here ). The converse of Schur's Lemma in finite dimensional vector spaces is: Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over the complex numbers. Let $S$ be a set of endomorphisms of $V$ and assume that every endomorphism $A$ of $V$ such that $$AB=BA\text{ for all }B\in S$$ is of the form $\lambda I, \ \lambda\in\mathbb{C}$. Then $V$ is a simple $S$-space. (*an endomorphism of $V$ is a linear operator from $V$ to $V$ *$V$ is a simple $S$-space if the only $S$-invariant subspaces of $V$ are $V$ itself and the zero subspace) What I've tried so far: Assume to the contrary that $V$ is not a simple $S-$space. Then, there exists a subspace $W$ of $V$ such that $W\not =\{0\}$, $W\not= V$ and $W$ is $S$-invariant. Let $W'=V\setminus W$. Then, since $V$ is finite, we can easily prove that $V=W\oplus W'$ (this is my attempt to translate Maschke's theorem in vector spaces). Consequently, for every $v\in V$, there exists unique $w\in W$ and $w'\in W'$, such that $v=w+w'$. Define the projection $P:V\rightarrow V$ by $Pv=w$ for every $v\in V$. What is left to prove is that $PB=BP$ for all $B\in S$. Then $P$ is clearly not a scalar and thus we have the contradiction we are looking for. There is a difficulty in showing that $PB=BP$ for all $B\in S$, because $W'$ might be $S$-invariant or not. More precisely: Let $v\in V=W\oplus W'$ and $v\not =0_V$. If $v\in W$ then $Bv\in W$ because $W$ is $S$-invariant, therefore: $PBv=Bv$ and $BPv=Bv$. If $v\in W'$ then $Pv=0$, hence $BPv=B\cdot 0=0$, and (i) if $Bv\in W'$ then $PBv=0$. (ii) if $Bv\in W$ then $PBv=Bv$ and this is where the problem occurs. Any hints, ideas or counterexamples would be very helpful.","['linear-algebra', 'vector-spaces']"

1844146,Picard's Iteration -- direct proof of convergence of sequence of integrals to $\tan x$.,"The extra credit question on one of the midterm exams for the online version of MIT's Honor's Differential Equations asks us to directly solve the IVP $y' = 1 + y^2$, $y(0) = 0$ and then show that the limit of the functions $y_{n+1} = \int y_n(s)ds$ as $n \to \infty$ is the same.  The first part is trivial:  $y = \tan x$.  However, the second part seems tougher.  It's not hard to calculate the first few iterations:
\begin{align}
y_0 &= 0\\
y_1 &= t\\
y_2 &= t + \frac{t^3}{3}\\
y_3 &= t + \frac{t^3}{3} + \frac{2t^5}{15} + \frac{t^7}{63}\\
\vdots
\end{align}
And we can write out (the beginning of) a Maclaurin expansion for $\tan t$:
\begin{align}
\tan t & = t + \frac{t^3}{3} + \frac{2t^5}{15} + \frac{17t^7}{315} + \cdots
\end{align}
This is, of course, suggestive.  But I see no obvious way to demonstrate that the $y_n$ will approach the latter polynomial as $n \to \infty$. Edit: Overnight reflection brought me to a possible solution, but I'm not particularly confident in it.  I would appreciate confirmation that what I do below makes sense--in particular, I'd appreciate confirmation that my reasoning is not circular. We note that the Maclaurin expansion for $\tan x$ is $x + R_1$, where $R$ is a polynomial of degree $> 1$.  Since $y = \tan x$ is a solution of our original ODE, we have
    \begin{align}
		\tan ' x & = 1 + \tan^2x\Rightarrow\\
		\tan x & = \int (1 + \tan^2x)dx\\
		& = \int [1 + (x + R_1)^2]dx\\
		& = \int (1 + x^2 + 2xR_1 + R_1^2)dx\\
		& = x + \frac{x^3}{3} + \int (2xR_1 + R_1^2)dx
	\end{align}
        Note that $2xR_1 + R_1^2$ is a polynomial of degree of at least $3$, so the last term of the sum above is a polynomial of degree at least $4$.  Call this polynomial $R_2$.  So we have
    \begin{align}
		\tan x = x + \frac{x^3}{3} + R_2
	\end{align}
        We now repeat the process:
    \begin{align}
		\tan x & = \int \left[1 + \left(x + \frac{x^3}{3} + R_2\right)^2\right]dx\\
		& = \int \left[1 + x^2 + \frac{2x^4}{3} + \frac{x^6}{9} + R_2p(x)\right]dx
	\end{align} 
        where $p(x)$ is some polynomial in $x$.  Then we have
        \begin{align}
		\tan x & = x + \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{2x^5}{15} + \frac{x^7}{63} + \int R_2p(x)dx
		\end{align}
        $\int R_3p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree of degree at least $7$; call it $R_4$.  Continuing to iterate in this way, we see that we are, in fact, repeating precisely the calculations we would make for our original Picard iteration.  So $\tan x = \lim_{n \to \infty} y_n$.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

I find that $\mathsf B$ is contained in $\mathsf A$ , but I have no idea if $\mathsf B$ is properly contained in $\mathsf A$ . Does anyone know  the answer?

1844240,How to prove $A\cos(\omega t-\phi)$ = $a\cos(\omega t)$ + $b\sin(\omega t)$ using $e^{i\theta}$?,"I want to show that $A\cos\left(\omega t-\phi\right)$ = $a\cos\left(\omega t\right)$ + $b\sin\left(\omega t\right)$ First I verified for myself through the angle addition proof that: $$ \cos\left(\omega t+ \phi\right) = \cos\left(\omega t\right)\cos\left(\phi\right) - \sin\left(\omega t\right)\sin\left(\phi\right) $$ and that $$ \cos\left(\omega t - \phi\right) = \cos\left(\omega t\right)\cos\left(-\phi\right) - \sin\left(\omega t\right)\sin\left(-\phi\right) $$ therefore I am able to show that: $$ \cos\left(\omega t - \phi\right) = \cos\left(\omega t\right)\cos\left(\phi\right) + \sin\left(\omega t\right)\sin\left(\phi\right) $$ as cos is an even function and sine is an odd function. I then multiply through by A: $$ A\cos\left(\omega t - \phi\right) = A\cos\left(\omega t\right)\cos\left(\phi\right) + A\sin\left(\omega t\right)\sin\left(\phi\right) $$ so that there are constants:
 $ A\cos\left(\phi\right) = a $ and $ A\sin\left(\phi\right) = b $ which gives the function: $A\cos\left(\omega t-\phi\right)$ = $a\cos\left(\omega t\right)$ + $b\sin\left(\omega t\right)$ used to model sinusoidal solutions of differential equations. If we take the case that $\phi = 0$ then there is no phase lag and: $A\cos\left(\omega t\right)$ = $A\cos\left(\omega t\right)$ with no $\sin\left(\phi\right)$ term, which is bizarre to me because it seems that if $\phi \neq 0 $ the equation $A\cos\left(\omega t-\phi\right)$ can be broken into  $a\cos\left(\omega t\right)$ + $b\sin\left(\omega t\right)$ whereas if $\phi = 0 $ the input of $\sin $ is ""lost"". Why can't $\cos\left( \omega t\right) $ always be decomposed to $\cos\left( \omega t\right) $  and $\sin\left( \omega t\right) $, I know that for $t = 0$ it is simply because $\sin\left( \omega t\right)  = 0$, but what about when $\omega \neq 0$, why can we not describe  $\cos\left( \omega t\right) $ in terms of $\cos\left( \omega t\right) $  and $\sin\left( \omega t\right) $?

1844334,Turing Decryption Example,"I know this exact same question exists but I am still having problems in understanding it. The following is given in the text: The message m can be any integer in the set {0,1,2,â¦,pâ1}; in parÂ­ticular, the message is no longer required to be a prime(p is a prime). The sender encrypts the message m to produce mâ by computing:
mâ=remainder(mk,p). Multiplicative inverses are the key to decryption in Turingâs code. Specfically, we can recover the original message by multiplying the encoded message by the inverse of the key: Let us name the equations from top to bottom from 1 to 3. Now I am just writing what I understood and it maybe wrong, so I will appreciate if someone tells me where I am wrong. We know m*=rem(mk, p)=mk%p , multiplying this equation by (k^-1) will give us equation 1. Corollary 4.5.2 states that 'a is congruent to rem(a, n) modulo n'. Thus we obtained equation 2 by replacing equality with the congruency sign, as a=mk and rem(a,n)=m* , thus they are congruent to each other and multiplying by (k^-1) on both sides doesnt make a difference. Now my confusion is (k^-1) != 1/k as k^-1 is not simply multiplicative inverse but multiplicative inverse modulo p, i.e., k.(k^-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p . Then how in equation 2 they replaced k.(k^-1) by 1 which resulted in equation 3. And if k^-1=1/k , they wouldnt talk about finding k^-1 using the Pulverizer, which they later do.","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"

Find the MLE of $P\{X_{i}=1\}$. Is the MLE unbiased? Does there exist an unbiased estimator of $P\{X_{i}=1\}$ whose variance achieves the Cramer-Rao lower bound? My thoughts: MLE of $\lambda$ is $\bar{X}$. Thus, MLE of $P\{X_{i}=1\}=\lambda e^{-\lambda}$ would be $\bar{X} e^{- \bar{X} }$. Because $E\bar{X} e^{- \bar{X} }=\lambda e^{-1/n-n\lambda+n\lambda e^{-1/n}}\ne \lambda e^{-\lambda }$, (Made a mistake before, as the expectation calculated as $\lambda e^{n-1-n\lambda+n\lambda/e}$) the MLE is biased.

1844345,Counting subsets of different sizes of a set,"Let $A$ be a non-empty set, and $\mathcal{P}^*(A)$ denote the power set of $A$ excluding empty set.

The question I am concerning here is about the number of equivalence classes of $\mathcal{P}^*(A)$ under $\sim$. When $A$ is a finite set, then the number of equivalence classes is easily seen to be $|A|$; this can also be proved if $A$ is countable, by providing a bijection between $A$ and the equivalence classes of $\mathcal{P}^*(A)$. Question: What is the number of equivalence classes of $\mathcal{P}^*(A)$ under $\sim$ if $A$ is uncountably infinite?

1844396,Tricky permutations question,"There are 8 buckets, each bucket is a different color (for simplicity, let's label the colors A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H; if you like: Aqua, Brown, Cyan, Diamond, Eggshell, Fuchsia, Green, Hot-pink). There are 8 balls, each a different colour (also A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H). Someone randomly throws all 8 balls into all 8 buckets, such that all buckets have exactly 1 ball in them after all 8 balls are thrown, and the process of throwing the balls into each bucket is completely random. Q: What's the probability of exactly 3 colour matches? That is, what's the probability that 3 (and only 3) buckets have a ball tossed in them that is the same color as the bucket? Here is what I've done so-far: The no. of sample points in the sample space is P(8,8) = 8!. The number of sample points in the event of exactly 3 color matches is C(8,3) (no. of ways of chooisng the 3 'matched' colors of 8), multiplied by the number of ways of arranging the 'unmatched colors' is (8 - 3 - 1 )! = 4! (For example, suppose the unmatched colors are D, E, F, G and H: The color of the ball in the D bucket can be E, F, G or H, i.e. 4 choices to prevent a color match. The number of choices to prevent a match in bucket E will be 3, then 2 in F, then 1 in G.) So, the answer I have is: C(8,3)*4! / 8!. One possible issue is with the calculation of 4! To follow from the example in the previous paragraph, suppose an Eggplant ball is placed in the Diamond bucket. Now, there are 4 choices on the second 'unmatched' throw rather than 3... And I don't know how to resolve this. I'm also not sure if the '3 from 8' color matches should be a combination as written, or permutation. If anyone has any thoughts on this problem -- suggestions for improvement or validation of what I've done -- I would really appreciate it. Incidentally, the problem is based on Example 2.22 from Wackerly et. al.'s 'Mathematical Statistics with Applications' 7ed, 2007, but an extension (they use 3 and 1 instead of 8 and 3), and using a different method from what was done in the example.","['statistics', 'probability']"
1844430,Number of disjoint circles in half plane minus a disk that touch both boundary components,"Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$ be right half-plane, with the disc $D$ removed, where $D$ is the disk of radius $r=3$ centered at $z_0=5$. What is the maximum number of disjoint open disks in $\Omega$ whose boundary touch both boundary components of $\Omega$? This is a question I had on my qualifying exam years ago; I couldn't solve it then, and today I stumbled upon it again and it nags me that I can't find a solution. Or at least, one without using any table or any map that I couldn't come up with on my own during an exam. What I did (then and now) is to transform conformally the right half plane into the unit circle, and then see where the disk $D$ is mapped. Then my idea was to count the number of circles in this scenario. If the circles are not those coming from vertical lines in the right half plane, then they will come from circles in the original domain $\Omega$ (a simple test for a circle not to be a ""bad"" circle, is not to be centered on the real line, for example). That is, 
$$
f(z)=\frac{z-1}{z+1}
$$
maps $\Omega$ to the unit disk with the disk $\tilde{D}$ removed, where $\tilde{D}$ is the disk centered at $w_0=\frac{11}{15}$ of radius $\frac{2}{15}$ (this follows from some elementary but tedious computations which I won't include in the question). Now, I don't know how many disjoint circles touching both boundary components of $f(\Omega)$ I can fit in it, nor do I know how to guarantee that the answer is invariant under $f^{-1}$.","['complex-analysis', 'conformal-geometry', 'mobius-transformation']"

Furthermore, given $n+1$ linear functions $l_i:\mathbb{C}^{n+1}\to\mathbb{C}$, with $i=0,\dots,n$, and taking the coordinates in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ to be $(z_0,\dots,z_n)$, it can be shown that the global vector field

Explicitely, (I believe, a confirmation of the following would be nice) the pushforward of this vector field is:
$$
p_*\left(\sum_{i=0}^nl(z)\frac{\partial}{\partial z_i}\right)=
\sum_{i=0}^nl(z)p_*\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z_i}\right),

So $U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha)=U(P,\alpha,f)-L(P,\alpha,f)$ Now from Theorem 6.8 of baby rudin $\alpha \in \mathscr R(f)$, so that a for any arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$ partition $P$ can always be found so that $U(P,\alpha,f)-L(P,\alpha,f)<\epsilon$. The same partition will do for $f$ with respect to $\alpha$. Any comments appreciated.","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"
1844737,Chow's lemma for non reduced schemes?,"Recall Chow's lemma: Chow's Lemma : If $X$ is a scheme that is proper over a noetherian base $S$ then
  there exists a projective $S$-scheme $X'$ and a surjective
  $S$-morphism $f : X'\to X$ that induces an isomorphism $f^{{-1}}(U)
 \simeq U$ for some dense open $ U\subset X$. I just looked at the proof on wikipedia (which presumably the one from EGA II) and found a slightly bothering detail. It starts by reducing to the irreducible case with the following argument: Argument: Let $U_i \subset X_i$ be the open dense subsets in each irreducible component which satisfy the lemma. Then $U := \coprod_i (U_i -\bigcup_{j \ne i} X_j)$ is open dense in $X$ and satisfies the lemma. If we interpret dense as dense in the zariski topology then everything works fine throughout. But if we want it to mean scheme theoretically dense there's a problem with the argument as their might be an embedded point in $U_i \cap X_j$ (consider two lines intersecting at a double point). Is there a way to ""fix"" the argument so that Chow's lemma will be true for dense = scheme theoretically dense ?

Show that $$\operatorname{Res}\left(\frac{1}{f}, z_0\right)=\frac{1}{f'(z_0)}.$$ Solution: Since $f$ is holomorphic in $\Omega$ , by Taylor's theorem, $f$ can be expanded in a power series around $z_0$ of the form $$f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n(z-z_0)^n, \,\, \text{where} \,\,a_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(z_0)}{n!}.$$ Now, since $f$ has a zero of order $1$ at $z_0$ , then $a_0 = 0$ and therefore $$f(z) = (z-z_0)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n+1}(z-z_0)^n \,\, \text{with} \,\, a_1 \neq 0.$$ Now for the part that I don't understand: Let $g(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n+1}(z-z_0)^n$ . Note that $g(z_0) \neq 0$ ( why? ) and $g(z)$ holomorphic ( where? ). I don't understand why $g(z_0) \neq 0$ . Is it because $f$ is non-constant by assumption?

I don't get this part either. Why does there exists a disc centered at $z_0$ of radius $r$ in which $g(z)$ is non-zero? Back to the solution. Therefore, the function $1/g$ is analytic in $D(z_0, r)$ . Now write $$\frac{1}{f(z)} = \frac{1}{(z-z_0)g(z)} \implies \operatorname{Res}\left(\frac{1}{f}, z_0\right) = \frac{1}{g(z_0)}$$ where $g(z_0) = a_1$ ( why? ) $= \frac{f^{(1)}(z_0)}{1!}$ .

1845074,Why can't we use the law of cosines to prove Fermat's Last Theorem?,"In investigating approaches to Fermat's Last Theorem I came across the following and I can't figure out where I am going wrong.  Any input would be greatly appreciated. We want to show that $a^n + b^n = c^n$ cannot hold for odd $n>1$ and pairwise relatively prime $a$, $b$, and $c$.  Assuming by way of contradiction that we have $a^n + b^n = c^n$ we must have $a$, $b$, and $c$ forming the sides of a triangle since $(a+b)^n > c^n$ so $a+b>c$.  Therefore the law of cosines can apply and we can write: $$c^2 = a^2+b^2 - 2ab{\cos{C}}$$ where $C$ is the angle opposite to side $c$.  If we add and subtract $2ab$ on the right-hand side we get $$c^2 = {(a+b)}^2 -2ab(\cos{C}+1)$$ Now, $a+b$ and $c$ share a common factor since $(a+b) | (a^n+b^n)$ for odd $n$ and $c^n = a^n+b^n$.  (Here $x | y$ means as usual, ""$x$ divides $y$"").Therefore, they share the same factor with $2ab(\cos{C}+1)$.
  Now, $\cos{C} + 1$ must be a rational number since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all integers.  So let $\cos{C} +1 = \frac{r}{s}$ where $r$ and $s$ are integers and $(r,s)=1$. (i.e. $\frac{r}{s}$ is a reduced fraction).  (Here, $(r,s)$ means as usual the greatest common divisor of $r$ and $s$.) Now assuming $a$, $b$, and $c$ are relatively prime we must have $(ab) |s$ for otherwise $c$ and $2ab$ would share a common factor.  Even moreso we must have $ab=s$ since otherwise $\frac{2abr}{s}$ would not be an integer.  (Since $c - a - b$ is even, we don't need $2 | s$).  So we can write: $$\cos{C}+1 = \frac{r}{ab}$$ or equivalently $$\cos{C} = \frac{r - ab}{ab}$$ Now we had from the law of cosines: $$c^2 = a^2+b^2 - 2ab{\cos{C}}$$ so making the substitution $\cos{C} = \frac{r - ab}{ab}$ we get $$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2r + 2ab$$ If we subtract $a^2$ to both sides and factor out the $b$ on the right-hand side, we get: $$c^2 - a^2 = b(b + 2a) - 2r$$ Now, $(c - a) | (c^2 - a^2)$ and also $(c-a) | (c^n - a^n)$. Then we must have $((c-a),b) >1$ since $b^n = c^n - a^n$.  From the equation above, we must therefore also have $(b,2r) > 1$.  Similarly we can show that we must have $(a,2r) > 1$. However, both of these conclusions are problematic since $r$ was initially assumed to be relatively prime to $s = ab$.  The only other option is that $a$ and $b$ are both even, but this is also problematic since $a$ and $b$ are assumed to be relatively prime. Thus we cannot have $a^n + b^n = c^n$  for odd $n>1$ and pairwise relatively prime $a$, $b$, and $c$.

1845132,Sample points from a multivariate normal distribution using only the precision matrix?,"I have a problem where I can directly compute the (sparse) precision matrix (inverse of the covariance) of a multivariate normal distribution, but the covariance itself is not sparse and I don't want to invert things. I would like to sample points using the precision matrix. What's a fast way to do this? I do know that the standard procedure is to compute the cholesky decomposition of the covariance , that is find lower triangular matrix L such that $LL' = \Sigma$ and then use a univariate generator to compute a vector of iid normal points $u$ so that finally the vector $z = \mu + Lu$ has the correct covariance. But that would require me computing the covariance AND then taking its Cholesky decomposition. Is there anything faster, using the fact that I have the precision matrix?",['linear-algebra']
1845133,Name of an angle between 0 and 180 degrees / $\pi$,"Is there a name for and angle larger than 0 and smaller than $\pi$ or 180 degrees?
So it covers acute, right and obtuse, it's kind of opposite of reflex angle . In my language there is a name for such an angle, so I'd be surprised if there isn't one in English. The term would then apply to every angle of a polygon iff that polygon is convex.","['angle', 'geometry']"
