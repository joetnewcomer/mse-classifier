865532,Union of Increasing Sequences of Monotone Classes is not a Monotone Class.,"In my text, we define a Monotone Class $\mathcal{M}$ of a non-empty set $X$ to be a collection of subsets of $X$ that is closed under monotone limits: that is,
$(1)$ if $A_{i} \uparrow A$ with $A_{i} \in \mathcal{M}$, then $A \in \mathcal{M}$ and $(2)$ if $A_{i} \downarrow A$ with $A_{i} \in \mathcal{M}$, then $A \in \mathcal{M}$. The exercise for which I am seeking solution verification says the following: If $(\mathcal{M}_{i})$ is an increasing sequence of monotone classes, then is $\mathcal{M} = \bigcup^{\infty}_{i=1} \mathcal{M}_{i}$ a monotone class? Prove or give a counterexample. I want to construct a counterexample as follows. Let $X = \mathbb{N}$. Put $\mathcal{M}_{1} = \{\{1\}\}$, $\mathcal{M}_{2} = \{\{1\}, \{1,2\}\}$, and, in general, $\mathcal{M}_{i} =  \{\{1\}, \{1,2\},\ldots, \{1,2,\ldots, i\} \}$. Then, $(\mathcal{M}_{i})$ is an increasing sequence of monotone classes. Now, let $A_{i}=\{1, \ldots,i\}$. Then, $(A_{i})$ is increasing, and $A_{i}$ belongs to $\mathcal{M}$ since $A_{i} \in \mathcal{M}_{i}$, for each $i$. Notice that $A_{i} \uparrow A$, where  $A = \bigcup A_{i} = \mathbb{N}$. But, $A \notin \mathcal{M}$ since $A \notin \mathcal{M}_{i}$ for any $i$. Is my counterexample constructed correctly? (Note: I have noticed that some defintoins of a monotone class require that the entire set be in the class. If my construct ion above is correct, then we can just add the entire set $X$ to each $\mathcal{M}_{i}$.) Thank you!","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'solution-verification']"
865559,Modern notational alternatives for the indefinite integral?,"I like the Leibniz notation, and I think the reason it's survived for over 300 years and continued to be almost the only game in town is that in many respects it's a miracle of design. Nevertheless it's an artifact of an earlier era in the history of mathematics, and anecdotally I seem to encounter a lot of mathematicians who feel that it's ugly, bad, and illogical. There seem to be two fundamental issues involved: (1) it's commonly interpreted using infinitesimals, which didn't get rehabilitated by non-standard analysis (NSA) until ca. 1960; (2) it predates the notion of a function. Issue #1 seems to me to be a non-issue. In fact Blaszczyk et al. (see p. 10) have argued that Leibniz and Fermat had a pretty fully developed notation and terminology for what NSA refers to as the ""standard part:"" they called it ""adequality"" and used the symbol ${}_{\ulcorner\!\urcorner}$. From this perspective what NSA contributed was nothing more than some systematization of long-established practices and some model-theoretic work that showed that this systematization was sufficient logical justification for those practices. But I think the complaints about the Leibniz notation may have more merit when it comes to issue #2. For example, in comments in this mathoverflow question , Andrej Bauer complains that: it's legal to write $\int x^2\: dx=x^3/3+C$ (which exposes the bound variable $x$) I suggested in that comment thread that this could be OK if one simply interpreted the notation $x$ as the identity function, but Andrej Bauer pointed out that that may not be enough to explain all possible uses of this feature of the notation. Are there well thought out modern alternatives to the Leibniz notation that would address issue #2? The closest I can think of is something like this: $ \int x \mapsto x^2 = \{f|\exists C\ f(x)=(x \mapsto x^3/3+C)\}$ This uses the notation $\mapsto$ for constructing anonymous functions, e.g., $x \mapsto x^2$ means the function $f$ such that $f(x)=x^2$. Well, it works here, but it's awfully painful to write. Are there better alternatives that are either used by a significant number of people or that have been ""test-driven"" enough to show that they're really practical?","['notation', 'calculus']"
865577,Area preserving transformation in a higher dimensional space is unitary.,"In $\mathbb{R}^3$, a linear operator $Q:\mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ preserves the area of parallelograms: that is, given $x,y\in \mathbb{R}^3$, the area of a parallelogram formed by $x$ and $y$ is the same as the area of a parallelogram formed by $Qx$ and $Qy$.  Show that $Q$ must be unitary (that is, $Q^T Q=I$, where $I$ is the identity.) This is from Shilov's Linear Algebra, Chapter $8$, exercise $32$.  I am self-studying and trying to do some exercises but I'm really stumped on this one.

865585,L'hopital's Rule in higher dimensions.,"I was working on getting intuition behind limits in multivariate calculus and I ran into this article . I am mostly concerned with the case where we have functions of two or three variables. Unfortunately I do not have the necessary background to understand the proof provided but I think that if the partial derivative in a given direction is not zero in the neighborhood of the limit point (for which the numerator and denominator are zero) then we have: $$\lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)} \frac{f(x,y)}{g(x,y)}=\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (a,b)} \frac{D_vf(x,y)}{D_vg(x,y)}$$ So when seeking to resolve a question about limits (when the numerator and denominator are both zero at the point), I should quickly check the partial derivative of the numerator and denominator in convenient directions and ensure that they do not both vanish in the neighborhood. Is this a correct interpretation?",['multivariable-calculus']
865590,Typo in Spivak's explanation of limits in Calculus?,"Here's what he says (including the preceding paragraph): ""To show in general that $f$ (where $f(x)=1/x$) approaches $1/a$ near $a$ for any $a$ we proceed in basically the same way, except that, again, we have to be a little more careful in formulating our initial stipulation. It's not good enough simply to require that $|x-a|$ should be less than $1$, or any other particular number, because if $a$ is close to $0$ this would allow values of $x$ that are negative (not to mention the embarrassing possibility that $x=0$, so that $f(x)$ isn't even defined!). The trick in this case is to first require that $|x-a| < \frac{|a|}{2}$; in other words, we require that $x$ be less than half as far from $0$ as $a$."" Okay, so I completely get the inequality, and what he's trying to say and why, but it seems like the English ""in other words"" part is not an equivalent statement to the inequality. If I were to translate the inequality to plain English, I would say, ""in other words, $x$ must be less than half as far from $a$ as $a$ is from $0$."" Or a more literal translation of the inequality itself, ""the difference between $x$ and $a$ must be less than half that of the difference between $a$ and $0$."" Normally I would just skid right by this type of thing and assume that the textbook author just made a typo, but given that this is Spivak and it's the fourth edition and whatnot I started to wonder whether I was just misunderstanding the logic of the statement, which irks me like nothing else. Here are the only two possible meanings of the sentence that I can discern (neither of which make sense in my view): (1) ""$x$ must be less than half as far from $0$ as $x$ is from $a$"" -or- (2) ""$x$ must be less than half as far from $0$ as $a$ is from $0$"" So suppose he means (1). So $x$ is a certain distance from $a$. Then the distance between $x$ and $0$ is less than half that distance. Even discounting the ""half"" specification, this statement would mean that $x$ is closer to 0 than it is to $a$, which, it seems to me, is the opposite of what that inequality is saying. Would (1) not translate to $|x|<\frac{|x-a|}{2}$? Now suppose he means (2). So $a$ is a certain distance from $0$. Then the distance between $x$ and $0$ is less than half that distance, which also seems to me to be blatantly incorrect, because according to the inequality, there can be an $x$ that is FARTHER from zero than $a$. Would (2) not translate to $|x|<\frac{|a|}{2}$? As I said before, I kind of doubt that I am correct about this - despite the fact that I can't think of a way that it could make sense - just because of the book that it's coming from. But I suppose there will always be typos in any book, so I'd just like to know if this is one. (I kind of doubt many of you happen to have a copy of Spivak's lying around, but this is on page 94 and it has a nice little diagram/number line that agrees with the inequality but not the statement... it seems to me.) Sorry for the length. Just trying to emulate Spivak's super thoroughness. :)","['inequality', 'calculus', 'limits']"

Apparently, $0 < Q(a) < 1$ and is monotonically increasing. Can we find a closed form expression for $Q(a)$? Or at least, some non-trivial bounds? Can we find the exact value of $Q(2)$, for example?

For those without the text handy: 1.20 Theorem (a) If $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $x > 0$ , then there is a positive integer $n$ such that $nx > y$ . (b) If $x \in \mathbb{R}$ , $y \in \mathbb{R}$ , and $x < y$ , then there exists a $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $x < p < y$ . Also a picture to the page in question: https://i.sstatic.net/U8hgO.png We are given that $x < y$ , thus $y - x > 0$ is obvious to me. I quickly lose Rudin after this step. I understand that the archimedean property $(a)$ is being used for the next line, where it says $n(y - x) > 1$ , however I have no clue where the number "" $1$ "" came from. Furthermore, he says to apply $(a)$ again, but I have no idea what it means to ""apply"" a theorem arbitrarily. He doesn't say what to apply it to, and if he meant to apply it on $n(y - x) > 1$ , then I am even more confused with the following step. He ""applies"" $(a)$ to obtain positive integers $m_1$ and $m_2$ such that $m_1 > nx$ and $m_2 > -nx$ . As far as I understand, the archimedean property says that for $x > 0$ , there is a positive integer $n$ such that $nx > y$ . I don't understand how $m_1 > nx$ and $m_2 > -nx$ follow this property. In $m_1 > nx$ , the equality sign is reversed from the archimedean property definition, and for $m_2 > -nx$ , there is a negative sign. And then the next line, he says ""hence"" there is an integer $m$ (with $-m_2 \leq m \leq m_1$ ) such that $m - 1 \leq nx \leq m$ . I don't understand how you can deduce from the previous lines ( $m_1 > nx$ and $m_2 > -nx$ ) to arrive at this one. Where are all these $m$ 's coming from? The only connection I see is that number $1$ from $n(y - x) > 1$ from the first step. I have no clue where these $m$ 's appeared out of nowhere.",['real-analysis']

865778,Showing two numbers are relatively prime in number fields,"Solve $x^3-2=y^2$ in integers.

It is asy to show that both $x,y$ must be odd. 1st proof: let $d= gcd(y+\sqrt{-2}, y-\sqrt{-2})$, then $d| 2 \sqrt{-2}= -(\sqrt{-2})^3$. So $d$ is a power of $\sqrt{-2}$.

The problem is to prove that if $\lim_{|x|\to\infty} f'(x)\cdot x=0$ then $g$ is bounded. My idea is to show that $\lim_{|x|\to\infty}|g(x) |=0$. (If that limit is valid, then there exists $K_1>0$ such that $|x|>K_1\Rightarrow|g(x) |<1$. Furthermore, as $|g|$ is continuous and $B[0,K_1]$ is compact, there exists $K_2>0$ such that $|g(x) |\leq K_2$ for all $x\in B[0,K_1 ]$. So, $|g(x) |\leq \max\{1,K_2\}$ for all $x\in\mathbb R^m$). For $m=1$, I've done the following. Let $(x_n )\subset\mathbb R$ be a sequence such that $\lim_{n\to\infty }|x_n |=\infty$. By the Mean Value Theorem, for each $n\in\mathbb N$ there exists $c_n$ between $x_n$ e $2x_n$ such that $$0\leq|g(x_n)|=|f(2x_n)-f(x_n)|\leq|f'(c_n)\cdot x_n|=\frac{|x_n|}{|c_n|}|f'(c_n)\cdot c_n|\leq 1\cdot|f'(c_n)\cdot c_n|.\tag{1}$$ Notice that $\lim_{n\to\infty}|c_n |=\infty$. So, taking the limit with $n\to\infty$, we get $$\lim_{n\to\infty}|g(x_n )|=0$$
which implies the desired result. The above solution does not work to arbitrary $m$ because, for $m\neq 1$, $x_n$ and $c_n$ are not scalars and thus the equality in $(1)$ is not valid. So, I need help to treat the general case. Thanks.","['multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives', 'limits']"

866166,Another version of the Poincaré Recurrence Theorem (Proof),"The task is to prove the following version of Poincaré's Recurrence Theorem: Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a finite measure space, $f\colon X\to X$ a measurable transformation that preserves the measure, i.e. $\mu(f^{-1}(E))=\mu(E)$ for all $E\in\Sigma$. Then for any $E\in\Sigma$ it is
    $$
\mu(\left\{x\in E|\left\{f^n(x)\right\}_{n>0}\subset X\setminus E\right\}=0,
$$
    i.e. almost every point in $E$ returns to $E$ infinitely often. Here is my Proof. $$
\tilde{E}:=\left\{x\in E|\left\{f^n(x)\right\}_{n>0}\subset X\setminus E\right\}=E\cap\left(\bigcap_{n>0}f^{-n}(X\setminus E)\right)
$$
$\tilde{E}$ is measurable, because $E$ is measurable, $f^{-n}(E^C)$ is measurable for each $n>0$ (as composition of measurable functions), and therefore $\bigcap_{n>0}f^{-n}(X\setminus E)$ and $\tilde{E}$ are measurable. Furthermore it is
$$
f^{-n}(\tilde{E})\cap\tilde{E}=\emptyset~\forall~n>0,
$$
because let $x\in f^{-n}(\tilde{E})$, then $f^n(x)\in\tilde{E}\subset E$, but for all $x\in\tilde{E}$ it is $f^n(x)\in X\setminus E$. Consider $n,m>0$ and w.l.o.g. $n>m$. Then it is
$$
f^{-n}(\tilde{E})\cap f^{-m}(\tilde{E})=f^{-m}(f^{-(n-m)}(\tilde{E})\cap\tilde{E})=f^{-m}(\emptyset)=\emptyset.
$$
So using the measure properties of $\mu$, the finiteness of $\mu$ and that $f$ preserves the measure it is 
$$
\infty > \mu(X)\geqslant \mu\left(\biguplus_{n>0}f^{-n}(\tilde{E})\right)=\sum_{n>0}\mu(f^{-n}(\tilde{E}))=\sum_{n>0}\mu(\tilde{E}).
$$
Because $\mu(\tilde{E})\geq 0$ it follows that $\mu(\tilde{E})=0$, because otherwise $\sum_{n>0}\mu(\tilde{E})<\infty$ would be impossible. That's it. Is my proof right? Would be great to get a feedback! Sincerely yours, math12","['measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"

866213,A few questions regarding the cosine difference identity,"I've a few questions that stem from the proof given in my textbook regarding the cosine difference identity. The proof goes like this: Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be angles plotted in standard position on the Unit Circle, where $\alpha \geqslant\beta $. (Ignore the $\alpha _0$ and $\beta _0$ in the diagram, just take them to mean $\alpha$ and $\beta$). Let $P$ be the point on the terminal side of $\alpha$ that lies on the Unit Circle, and $Q$ be the point the terminal side of $\beta$ that lies on the Unit Circle. This gives: Plotting the angle $\alpha -\beta$ in standard position gives: Let $A$ be the point on the terminal side of $\alpha -\beta$ that lies on the Unit Circle, and $B$ be the point where the initial side of the angle $\alpha -\beta$ intersects the Unit Circle. As the angles $POQ$ and $AOB$ are congruent this must mean the chords $PQ$ and $AB$ are also equal, and it is possible to set up an equivalance relationship between the two. The distance formula yields: $$\sqrt {(\cos \alpha  - \cos \beta )^2 + (\sin \alpha  - \sin \beta )^2}  = \sqrt {(\cos (\alpha  - \beta ) - 1)^2 + (\sin (\alpha  - \beta ) - 0)^2} $$ Squaring both sides to remove the square root: $$(\cos \alpha  - \cos \beta )^2 + (\sin \alpha  - \sin \beta )^2 = (\cos (\alpha  - \beta ) - 1)^2 + (\sin (\alpha  - \beta ) - 0)^2$$ $$\cos ^2\alpha  - 2\cos \alpha \cos \beta  + \cos ^2\beta  + \sin ^2\alpha  - 2\sin \alpha \sin \beta  + \sin ^2\beta  = \cos ^2(\alpha  - \beta ) - 2\cos (\alpha  - \beta ) + 1 + \sin ^2(\alpha  - \beta )$$ $$(\cos ^2\alpha  + {\sin ^2}\alpha ) + (\cos ^2\beta  + \sin ^2\beta ) - 2\cos \alpha \cos \beta  - 2\sin \alpha \sin \beta  = (\cos ^2(\alpha  - \beta ) + \sin ^2(\alpha  - \beta )) + 1 - 2\cos (\alpha  - \beta )$$ $$2 - 2\cos \alpha \cos \beta  - 2\sin \alpha \sin \beta  = 2 - 2\cos (\alpha  - \beta )$$ $$\cos (\alpha  - \beta ) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta  + \sin \alpha \sin \beta $$ So that's how it was derived. My questions are: As the point P (the point where the terminal side of the angle $\alpha$ intersects the Unit Circle) is in the second quadrant, where $x<0$ and therefore $\cos (\alpha)<0$ shouldn't the coordinates for the point $P$ be $(-\cos(\alpha), \sin(\alpha))$? Furthermore what would happen if the angle $\alpha$was a quadrant III angle where both $\sin (\alpha)<0 $ and $\cos (\alpha )<)$. Surely this would affect computations of the cosine difference identity some what? If not, then why? Why does it seem like its computed only for quadrant I angles? Why does that identity stand for all quadrants is what I'm asking essentially? The cosine difference formula is derived by equating the distance\length of the two chords $PQ$ and $AB$, however we ""square out"" the square root inherent in the distance formula. What if I were to do:
  $\sqrt {2 - 2\cos (\alpha  - \beta )} $ (which is the simplified version of the RHS of the equation before we manipulate it to give us the identity) Would this give me the distance between the two chords? What difference would it make if angle $\alpha $ was smaller than $\beta $? What would happen if the angle $(\alpha -\beta)$ was greater $180^\circ$ or $\pi$ radians?

P(X=H)=\sum_{y=1}^{6} P(Y=y, X=H)

P(N(s)=n) &= P(T_n \le s <T_{n+1}) \\
&=\int_0^s P(T_n=t \le s<T_{n+1})dt \\
&=\int_0^s P(T_n=t\textrm{ and }\tau_{n+1}>s-t)dt \\
&=\int_0^s f_{T_n}(t) P(\tau_{n+1}>s-t)dt \textrm{ (by independence?)} \\
&=\int_0^s \lambda e ^{-\lambda t} \frac{(\lambda t)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} P(\tau_{n+1}>s-t)dt \textrm{ (sum of exponentials $T_n$ is $gamma(n,\lambda)$) } \\
&=\int_0^s \lambda e ^{-\lambda t} \frac{(\lambda t)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} (1-F_\tau (s-t)) \\
&=\int_0^s \lambda e ^{-\lambda t} \frac{(\lambda t)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} e^{-\lambda(s-t)} \\
&=e^{-\lambda s} \frac{\lambda^n}{(n-1)!} \int_0^s t^{n-1} dt \\
&=e^{-\lambda s} \frac{\lambda^n}{(n-1)!} \frac{s^n}{n!} \\

866501,Uniform convergence result in proof of second-derivative formula,"This is a fairly basic analysis question. Consider a continuous function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ which is twice differentiable at a point $x$. If necessary, also assume that $f \in C^2(\mathbb{R})$. Chasing through the definitions, we have $$f''(x) := \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f'(x+h) - f'(x)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0}\left(\lim_{k\to 0} \frac{f(x+h+k) - 2f(x+k) + f(x)}{hk}\right).$$ We have two limit processes - one with $h$ and one with $k$, but perhaps we can sort of ""set $h=k$"" and combine these limit processes, as in: $$f''(x) \overset{?}= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+2h) - 2f(x+h) +f(x)}{h^2}.$$ I am trying to convert this into a Baby Rudin-type problem as follows: Define (continuous) functions $F_n(k)$ for $k\in[0,a]$ by
$$F_n(k) = \begin{cases} \frac{f(x+\frac1n+k) - 2f(x+k) + f(x)}{k/n}&k \in(0,a]\\ \lim_{k\to 0}\frac{f(x+\frac1n+k) - 2f(x+k) + f(x)}{k/n}&k=0\end{cases}.$$ Showing that the $F_n$ converge uniformly to $F_{\infty} := \lim_{n\to \infty}F_n$ for some $a >0$ seems to suffice for our problem. (How to prove this is my question.) With uniform convergence, then by Baby Rudin Theorem 7.11, $F_{\infty}$ is continuous at $0$ so that we may find a $\delta$ such that if $k < \delta$, then $|F_{\infty}(0) - F_{\infty}(k)| < \varepsilon/2$, and also there is an $M$ such that for $n\geq M$ we have $|F_n(k) - F_{\infty}(k)| < \varepsilon/2$ for all $k$. So we have $|F_n(k) - F_{\infty}(0)| < \varepsilon$ when both $k < \delta$ and $n \geq M$. We can find $N$ (such as $\max(M,\lceil\delta^{-1}\rceil)$ I think) for which we can set $k = \frac1n$ if $n \geq N$, which is essentially what we wanted. So my questions is: How can we show that the $F_n$ converge uniformly to $F_{\infty}$, or if we need some extra conditions, then what are they? I would also be interested in easier (still rigorous) ways of concluding that we may ""set $h=k$"", or obviously any mistakes in my approach.

866608,Does there exist Latin square critical sets for which deleting any entry results in arbitrarily many completions?,"For those familiar with Latin squares terminology, I'll get straight to the point: Q : For all $N \geq 2$, does there exists a critical set $C$ (for a Latin square of any finite order) such that deleting an entry from $C$ always results in $\geq N$ completions? I'm guessing the answer is yes, but it doesn't strike me as obvious how to construct such critical sets.  (Although, as always, I could be missing something.) For those who aren't familiar (or who are rusty, or use different terminology)... A partial Latin square is an $n \times n$ matrix with symbols from $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ and possibly some empty cells in which no symbol is repeated in a row or column. A Latin square $L=(l_{ij})$ is said to be a completion of a partial Latin square $P=(p_{ij})$ if $l_{ij}=p_{ij}$ whenever cell $(i,j)$ in $P$ is nonempty. A critical set is a partial Latin square $P$ that (a) admits a unique completion, and (b) admits $\geq 2$ completions after deleting any entry. Here is an example of a critical set:

866712,Involutions of the second type in a division algebra,"I'm trying to figure out some details about involutions of division algebra, thought maybe someone here might have a better insight. Let $k$ be a $p$-adic or number field, and let $K=k[\sqrt{\delta}]$ be a non-trivial extension of degree $2$. For $x\in K$, let $\bar{x}$ denote the conjugate of $x$ under the non-trivial $K/k$ automorphism. Let $D$ be a division algebra of degree $\ell$ with $Z(D)=K$. For simplicity, we shall assume that $\ell$ is prime (or even $\ell=3$ is enough for the moment). An involution of the second type of $D$ is a $k$-linear anti-automorphism of $\tau:D\to D$ which coincides with $\bar{ }$ on $K$, and is of order two. That is to say that for any $t,s\in D$ and $\alpha,\beta\in $K$ $$(1)\:\tau(\alpha t+\beta s)=\bar{\alpha}\tau(t)+\bar{\beta}\tau(s),\quad(2)\: \tau(st)=\tau(t)\tau(s),\quad\text{and}\quad(2)\:\tau^2(t)=t.$$ Note that if $\tau,\eta$ are two involutions of type 2 of $D$, then $\tau\circ\mu$ is a $K$-automorphism of $D$. It follows easily (by the Skolem-Noether theorem) that there exists some $\gamma\in D$ such that $\tau(t)=\gamma^{-1}\mu(t)\gamma$ for all $t\in D$. In the case where $D$ is a quaternion algerbra over $K$ (i.e. a division algebra of degree $2$), one can construct a non-trivial involution of the second type on $D$ in the following way: Since the order of quaternion algebras in the Brauer group of a field is two, it follows that for any field $L$ and quaternion algebra $L$ has a non-trivial $L$-involution (i.e. an $L$-linear anti-automrophism of the algebra). This holds since the fact that $L$ has order two in the Brauer group is equivalent to $L$ being isomorphic to $L^{op}$, the opposite algebra, and hence existence of a non trivial map $L\to L^{op}$, which is the same thing as an anti-automorphism. Let $\mathbf{d}$ be a quaternion algebra over $k$, and let $\tau':\mathbf{d}\to\mathbf{d}$ be the non-trivial $k$ involution. One shows that $D\cong \mathbf{d}\otimes_K K$ as $K$-algebras, and that the map defined on generators by $\tau(t\otimes \alpha)=\tau(t)\otimes \bar{\alpha}$ is a field automorphism. The question is- what happens for higher degrees? In the book ""The Book of Involutions"", Knus presents an argument for the existence of a non-trivial involution of the second type on $D$. Namely, such an involution exists if and only if the norm $N_{K/k}(D)$ is a split $F$ algebra (see $\S 3$ of the book for the definition of the norm algebra, I  will add it here if someone here irequests it). My problem with Knus's proof is that it in not constructive, in the sense that it presents the reader with a bijection between the set of 2nd type involutions of $D$, and some specific set of left-sided ideals in $N_{K/k}(D)$, but shows that such ideals exists if the splitting condition holds. But it is terribly unclear to me, how to go back and construct such an involution once you've shown that it exists. So, after all this long introduction- here is my question Question : Does anybody here know of an example of a division algebra of degree 3 (or higher) over a $p$-adic or global field, which has a non-trivial and explicitly presented involution of the second type? I would be very thankful for any reference or example that anyone can offer. Thank you.","['division-algebras', 'involutions', 'abstract-algebra', 'number-theory']"

866987,bounded function and compact issue,"Here is the problem, i have a definite fonction on an open set and I feel that the question is asking to use a compact argument let $f:\mathbb{R^n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ continuous, we also admit that $\lim_{\lVert x\rVert \to\infty}f(x) =+\infty$. 1)Prove that $f$ is bounded lowerly. 2)prove that $\inf_{x\in\mathbb{R^n}}f(x)$ is reached So what I tried to do : $\mathbb{R^n}$ is an open set but it is known that all closed and bounded intervals of $\mathbb{R^n}$ are compacts.
So I decided to proceed this way : let A $\subset \mathbb{R^n}$ a compact with $T_A$ its induced topology possible because $\mathbb{R^n}$ is a finite dimensional set. Basing on Tychonoff's theorem saying that a product of compacts is a compact, let's take the known set $\forall i \in \{1,..,n\}$ $\forall a_i,b_i\in\mathbb{R}$, $\prod_{i=1}^n[a_i;b_i] \subset A$ which is a compact. I want to prove that $f$ is lowerly bounded so I use my admitted hypothesis that $f$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R^n}$ so it would mean it is continuous on all of its closed subsets, so continuous on all of its compact because $\mathbb{R^n}$ is a finite dimensional set (I don't remember well but it seems to me that it was a necessary and sufficient condition to say that compacts are equivalent to closed and bounded sets). And finally because it is continuous on a compact and has its value in $\mathbb{R}$
 then, $f$ would be lowerly bounded and reach its infimum but not its supremum because we supposed $\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=+\infty$. And then answer the two questions at the same time. Question 1 : Can I just take a compact subset of $\mathbb{R^n}$ just the way I did and finally conclude with my $f$ function generalizing it is bounded on all $\mathbb{R^n}$ ? I just feel it isn't enough. Question 2 : $\mathbb{R^n}$ is an open set, I don't understand how is it possible to just take a gathering of compacts and then ""globalizing"" the results to an open one.

866999,Leray's theorem for cech and derived sheaf cohomology.,"My question is about the hypothesis of Leray's theorem. This theorem says that if $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of a topological space $X$, and $\mathcal{F}$ is a sheaf over $X$ and if $\check{H}^q(U_s,\mathcal{F})=0$, $q>0$  where $U_s$ is any finite intersection of elements of $\mathcal{U}$, then 
$$\check{H}^p(\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{F})\cong H^p(X,\mathcal{F})$$
where $H^*(X,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the derived functor cohomology. Note in particular the hypothesis, under the seeingly weaker hypothesis, $H^q(U_s,\mathcal{F})=0$, I have a proof sketched below. My questions is essentially how to prove Leray's this under the stronger hypothesis given ? Concerning the literature, its weak on this point, many books either do not prove the theorem, or only state the theorem with the weaker hypothesis, or give references to original works where the notation leaves one in doubt as what the hypothesis are and whose proofs lack detail and clarity. Now follows a sketch of a proof assuming the derived functor cohomology is zero, $H^q(U_s,\mathcal{F})=0$. 
Let $0\rightarrow \mathcal{F}\rightarrow \mathcal{I}^0\rightarrow \ldots$ be an injective resolution of $\mathcal{F}$ and $\check{C}^p(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{I}^q)$ the Godement resolution of $\mathcal{I}^q$. So we have a double complex, (which I dont know how to latex here)  the columns (except the first) are exact since  $\mathcal{I}^q$ is flabby and the homology of the rows gives $\check{C}^p(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{H}^q(\mathcal{F}))$ and since this latter is $\prod_s H^q(U_s, \mathcal{F})=0$ we see that the rows (except the first) are exact and one can now chase to define an isomorphism between the homologies of the first row and first column. Alternatively one can view this as taking $E_2^{p,q}$ of the double complex spectral sequence which must degenerate and so the edge homomorphism gives the isomorphism. So how to carry this out only assuming $\check{H}^q(U_s,\mathcal{F})=0$ ? $\bf{Edit :}$ In the meantime I have a solution. I decided not to delete the question, or post my own solution, instead I communicate here my proof and remark that if anyone wishes to post answers which clarify any point related I will upvote and eventually accept an answer. 
The relevant literature is Godement 5.9.2 where he attributes the stronger theorem to Cartan. The idea is to show by induction on $q$ that $\check{H}^q(U_s,\mathcal{F})\rightarrow H^q(U_s,\mathcal{F})$ is an isomorphism for all $s$. For if we have this for all $q<n$ the we apply the previous version with $U_s$ instead of $X$ and taking now those intersections of $\mathcal{U}$ contained in $U_s$. The induction hypothesis gives not that all rows are exact but only that the first $n$ are exact (or zero in $E_2$). This suffices to show the isomorphism at the next stage. Lastly remark that the previous double complex under the limit of $\mathcal{U}$ gives a double complex for Cech to derived cohomology.","['sheaf-theory', 'homological-algebra', 'spectral-sequences', 'algebraic-geometry']"
867004,Does the possibility of linear coordinate changes imply that the manifold is Euclidean?,"Question. Let $M$ be a smooth manifold admitting an atlas $\mathcal{A}$ (i.e. a collection of coordinate charts that covers the whole manifold) with the following property: for every pair $(U, \mathbf{x}),\ (U', \mathbf{x}')\in \mathcal{A}$, the transition function $$\mathbf{x'}\circ\mathbf{x}^{-1}\colon \mathbf{x}(U\cap U')\subset \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbf{x}'(U\cap U')\subset\mathbb{R}^n $$ is (the restriction of) an isometry of $\mathbb{R}^n$ onto itself. Is $M$ diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$? Motivation for this conjecture comes from the fact that in such a manifold one can define a Riemannian inner product in exactly the same way as one does in Euclidean space: 
$$\text{if }\mathbf{v}=v^\alpha\partial_\alpha,\ \mathbf{w}=w^\beta\partial_\beta,\quad \text{then } g(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w})=\sum_\alpha v^\alpha w^\alpha.$$
This definition is well posed because it is independent of the chosen coordinate chart in the atlas $\mathcal{A}$. The Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is flat and locally isometric to $\mathbb{R}^n$. I don't know if this extends to a global diffeomorphism, though. Secondary question. What if the transition functions $\mathbf{x}'\circ\mathbf{x}^{-1}$ are merely affine transformations of $\mathbb{R}^n$ onto itself? In this case, the previous assignment for a Riemannian metric $g$ is ill-posed. However, one can still define a flat affine connection as follows: 
$$\nabla_\mathbf{w} \mathbf{v}= w^\alpha\frac{\partial v^\beta}{\partial x^\alpha} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\beta}.$$
It would be interesting to know if this suffices to have a global diffeomorphism onto $\mathbb{R}^n$.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

where $\psi(\cdot)$ is the second Chebyshev function and $\phi(\cdot)$ is Euler's totient function. RHS is Euler's Prime Product from OEIS. Is this a known identity? (Still an open question, though I think Kronecker knew about it.) Edit How I found this identity: I created a palindromic divisor sequence to see if I could find a solution to Oppermann's conjecture by evaluating the divisors of the composite numbers in the attempt to isolate the primes. An example:
$$\left(

 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
 1 & 3 & 1 & 4 \\
 3 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\
\end{array}

where we have two palindromic sequences when we drop the last elements. Notice that the count of ones corresponds to Euler's Totient function. The left hand matrix corresponds to the numerator and the right hand side to the denominator. Edit2 The palindrome for the LHS is: $\{1,2,3,4,1,3,1,4,3,2,1,4\}$, which is the underlying value of the right-most column of the RHS before the $5$'s are overlaid. So, to determine the significance of this observation, I crafted the fraction at the top of the post, created a short sequence of denominators, searched OEIS, and found this identity. (Thanks to Gerry Myerson who crafted the proof below.) The divisor sequence appears to be related to Mertens's theorem and the Riemann's Hypotheses. This is unexpected, so discovering the identity was serendipitous. I have no interest in proving this regarding Riemann. My only interest is to show that the symmetic divisor sequence is predictable.

867203,Describing the Wreath product categorically.,"The Details: Let's have a recap of some definitions (taken from ""Nine Chapters in the Semigroup Art"" (pdf), by A. J. Cain). Definition 1: Let $P$ be a semigroup. The left action of $P$ on a set $X$ is an operation $\cdot:P\times X\to X$ such that $(pq)\cdot x=p\cdot (q\cdot x)$ for all $x\in X$ , $p, q\in P$ . Such a left semigroup action defines an anti-homomorphism $\psi:P\to\mathcal{T}_X$ by setting $x(p\psi)=p\cdot x$ (so for all p, q, we have $(pq)\psi=(q\psi)(p\psi))$ . If $X$ is a semigroup, the left action of $P$ on $X$ acts by endomorphisms if for all $p\in P$ , we have $x\psi\in\operatorname{End}(X)$ , so given $x, y\in X$ , $$xy\cdot p=(x\cdot p)(y\cdot p).$$ In this case, the semidirect product of $P$ and $X$ with respect to $\psi$ , denoted $X\rtimes_{\psi} P$ , is the Cartesian product $X\times P$ under $$(x_1, p_1)(x_2, p_2)=(x_1(p_1\cdot x_2), p_1p_2).$$ Definition 2: Let $S$ and $T$ be semigroups. Then the Wreath product of $S$ and $T$ , denoted $S\wr T$ , is given by the semidirect product $S^T\rtimes_\varphi T$ with respect to $\varphi$ , where $S^T$ is the direct product of the set $S$ indexed by $T$ and $\varphi:T\to \mathcal{T}_{S^T}$ is the anti-homomorphism associated with the left action $\cdot:T\times S^T\to S^T$ such that for all $x, y\in T, f\in S^T$ , $$^yf:=y\cdot f\quad\text{and}\quad (x)\cdot\, ^yf=(xy)\cdot f=\,^{xy}f.$$ So it's $S^T\times T$ under $$(f_1, s_1)(f_2, s_2)=(f_1 \,^{s_1}f_2, s_1s_2).$$ The Question: This all seems suggestive (to me) of exponentiation in some category of semigroups but I can't for the life of me figure out the details of that.

However, I believe it is not hard to show (basically one computes the fibre product affine-locally) that the underlying space of $X\times_{Z}Y$ IS homeomorphic to the topological pullback if $X\to Z$ is any of the following: an open embedding a closed embedding induced by localization (i.e. $Spec(S^{-1}A)\to Spec(A)$.) In particular, if one composes these things in the correct order, I believe this gives a one-line proof that the scheme-theoretic fibre over a point agrees with the topological fibre. These also happen to be the canonical examples of monomorphisms (along with compositions of these) in the category of schemes that I know of.
