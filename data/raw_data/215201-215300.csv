4365652,"Given the length of the diagonals, what is the maximum perimeter of a quadrilateral?","Suppose the length of the diagonal $d$ . I'd like to maximize the perimeter of a quadrilateral containing two of these diagonals. I know that for a rectangle instead of a quadrilateral, the solution is the square, obtaining a perimeter of length $4d\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2\sqrt{2}d$ . However when not constraint by right angles, the solution must more than the square's perimeter, since one could construct a triangle of side lengths $d$ , $d$ and $\sqrt{2}d$ by coinciding two ends of the diagonals, and creating a right angle, giving a perimeter of $(2 + \sqrt{2})d$ . What is the largest perimeter possible? EDIT: as pointed out by Henry, I'd like the shape to be convex, or else the perimeter is unbounded. Also, a flat quadrilateral, where the diagonals are basically aligned, has a perimeter of $4d$ . The difficulty is to prove it optimal.","['quadrilateral', 'optimization', 'geometry']"
4365656,Prove the triangles $LBE$ and $LKD$ are congruent.,"I found this problem in a 2019 mathematics competition in Hunan, China. I am a Chinese high school student. There is a triangle $ABC$ which is not equilateral. The point $H$ is the orthocenter of it. The circumscribed circle of the triangle has a tangent $BK$ . The line $HK$ is perpendicular to $BK$ . The midpoint of $AC$ is $L$ . How to prove $LB$ = $LK$ ? I drew lines $AH$ and $CH$ . Then I plotted a circle with the center $L$ and the diameter $AC$ . Suppose the points $D$ , $E$ are respectively the intersections of the circle $L$ and the lines $AH$ , $CH$ . Then I guess that the triangles $LBE$ and $LKD$ are congruent. But I can't prove it.","['contest-math', 'euclidean-geometry', 'geometry', 'geometric-construction']"
4365679,A detail in a proof of the Steiner's inequality about sets of finite perimeter,"Given an open limited set $E$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary, how could I subdivide this set $E$ in a finite number of normal sets? I remind you that the normal set is a set of this form, given an open set $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and two functions $\varphi_{1}$ and $\varphi_2$ defined on $A$ the corresponding normal set is $$\{(x,y) \in A : \varphi_{1}(x)<y<\varphi_{2}(x)\}.$$ Subdivide means to partition the set at most excluding $\mathcal{H}^{n}$ negligible sets.
My question emerges from a proof of the Steiner inequality that Francesco Maggi gives in this book at pag 161. https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/sets-of-finite-perimeter-and-geometric-variational-problems/F8D0DABFFFB0D444C5AD5D37B3E3DBC1 What I know for certain is that I can choose a hyperplane $\Pi$ for which there are a $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}-$ negligible amount of points with normal vector parallel to the hyperplane $\Pi.$ So almost all of the perpendicular lines to $\Pi$ are intersecting $E$ in a finite number of segments. In the figure I tried to give a sense of what I am asking.","['differential-geometry', 'geometric-measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
4365715,Why is the factor in Doob‘s classical $L^p$ inequality optimal?,"I encountered a following formulation of the Doob's $L^p$ inequality. Let $T\neq\emptyset$ be a totally ordered set and suppose that $X=(X_t)_{t\in T}$ is a positive submartingale. Define $X^*=\mathrm{ess}\,\mathrm{sup}_{t\in T}X_t$ and $X_u^*= \mathrm{ess}\,\mathrm{sup}_{t\in T, t\le u}X_t$ for every $u\in T$ . Then, for every $p>1$ , $$ \mathbb{E}[(X_u^*)^p]\le \left(\frac{p}{p-1}\right)^p\mathbb{E}[(X_u)^p], \quad u\in T $$ and $$ \mathbb{E}[(X^*)^p]\le \left(\frac{p}{p-1}\right)^p  \sup_{u \in T} \mathbb{E}[(X_u)^p].$$ In the textbook it is mentioned as a side note, that the factor $p/(p-1)$ is optimal. I am missing an explanation to this. I tried to show it by taking another smaller factor and (hopefully) show that the inequality is not valid anymore, but I can‘t seem to get to a solution. I hope someone can give me some input whether my approach is right and if not, how can I show that this factor is optimal.

4365726,"Parity of number of subsets of $\{1,2,3, \ldots, n\}$ whose average value is an integer","Let $n\in \mathbb Z^{+}$ and $S_n = \{1,2,3, \ldots, n\}$ . A subset $A$ of $S_n$ is said to be beautiful if the average of all the elements in $A$ is an integer. Let $G_n$ be the set of all beautiful subsets of $S_n$ . Prove that $|G_n| \equiv n \bmod 2$ . Here's all I've been able to do: First, it is easy to see what must be proved true for $n = 1, 2$ . I assume the thing to be proved true up to $n =k$ ; I will prove it also for $n = k+1$ . Thus, I partition the beautiful subsets of $S_n$ into two categories: Type $1$ : Beautiful subsets that do not contain $n+1$ . Let $B$ be the number of subsets of type $1$ . By the assumption of induction, we get $|B| \equiv n-1 \bmod 2$ . Type $2$ : Beautiful subsets that do contain $n+1$ . Let the number of subsets of type $2$ be $C$ . My idea in this case is: Let $T$ be the average of any $s$ numbers ( $1\le s \le n+1$ ) that contain $n+1$ (where each number is ${}>1$ ). I realize that : \begin{align*}T&=\frac{a_1+a_2+a_3+\cdots+a_{s-1}+(n+1)}{s}\\&= \frac{s+(n+1-1)+a_1-1+a_2-1+\cdots+a_{s-1}-1}{s}\\&=s+ \frac{n+(a_1-1)+(a_2-1)+ \cdots +(a_{s-1}-1)}{s}\end{align*} $\Rightarrow T\in \mathbb{Z}$ if and only if the average of $(n,a_1-1,a_2-1,\ldots,a_{s-1}-1)$ is also an integer (because $a_i>1\Rightarrow a_i-1>0$ ). Thus we can calculate the number of beautiful subsets of $S_{n+1}$ containing $n+1$ with each element being ${}>1$ , which is the number of beautiful subsets of $S_n$ containing $n$ . And Cranium Clamp suggested that if $Q=\frac{b_1+b_2+\cdots+b_{s-1}}{s} \in \mathbb{Z}$ , then $\{b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_{s-1},Q\}$ is a beautiful subset. Thus, the problem that I have not solved is that the sets of type $2$ contain both $(n+1)$ and $1$ .","['number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'elementary-number-theory']"

4365805,"Open sets $U, V$ such that $U, V$ and $ U \cup V$ are all simply connected but $U \cap V$ is disconnected","In $(\mathbb{R^2}, \tau_E)$ , I would like to find some open sets $U, V$ such that $U, V$ and $ U \cup V$ are all simply connected but $U \cap V$ is disconnected. I am not sure whether it is possible or not. I thought that I could take $U = \{x^2 + y^2 = 1, y < \frac{1}{2}\}$ and $V = \{x^2 + y^2 = 1, y > - \frac{1}{2}\}$ . This way I obtain that $U \cap V$ is disconnected but the problem is that $ U \cup V$ is only connected and not simply connected (as it is $\mathbb{S}^1$ ). Do you have any idea of how to either find some $U,V$ that fit or prove that it is impossible to find such sets ?

4365831,Does Radon-Nikodym derivative affect the Variance of a Random Variable?,"Edit 26 January 2022 : The answer below elegantly shows that when the diffusion term of an Ito process is not constant in $\omega$ , it is generally not true that Variance remains unaffected by the change of measure. In the question below, however, the focus is on the case where the diffusion term of the stochastic process is constant. I would therefore appreciate any additional answers that would focus on the case with constant diffusion term. Additionally, it would be amazing to make a link between the continuous and the discrete case that are discussed below. Original question : Suppose $$X_t:=W^{\mathbb{P}}_t+\mu t$$ with $W^{\mathbb{P}}$ being the standard Wiener process under $\mathbb{P}$ . We know that trivially, under $\mathbb{P}$ , the PDF for $X_t$ would be: $$f_{X_t}(h)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{t2\pi }}\exp\left(\frac{-(h-\mu t)^2}{2t}\right)$$ The Cameron-Martin-Girsanov theorem gives us the Radon-Nikodym derivative that will turn $X_t$ into a standard Wiener process under some new $\mathbb{Q}$ , specifically: $$\frac{d\mathbb{Q}}{d\mathbb{P}}=\exp\left(\frac{-2X_t\mu t+\mu^2t^2}{2t}\right)=\exp\left(-X_t\mu +0.5\mu^2t\right)=\exp\left(-W_t\mu -0.5\mu^2t\right)$$ Under $\mathbb{Q}$ , the PDF for $X_t$ now becomes: $$f_{X_t}(h)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{t2\pi }}\exp\left(\frac{-h^2}{2t}\right)$$ Bottom line : changing the measure has resulted in a different mean, but the variance has been preserved (it remains $t$ under both measures). Question : I came up with a toy example to illustrate a change of measure on the following Binomial tree, but the change of measure seems to have produced a change in the variance. Was I wrong to assume that change of measure always preserves variance? Is there a proof that shows otherwise? Toy example : $X_t$ is now a single-period variable, which can take the values { $110,95$ } with equal probabilities of 0.5 under $\mathbb{P}$ : Under $\mathbb{P}$ , we have: $$\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{P}}[X_1]=0.5*110 + 0.5 * 95 = 102.5$$ (note that the ""drift"" is 2.5% per this single period, i.e. on ""average"", we move to 102.5 from the initial value of 100), whilst we have $$Var^{\mathbb{P}}(X_1)=\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{P}}[(X_1-102.5)^2]=0.5*7.5^2+0.5*7.5^2=56.25$$ Now we define $\frac{d\mathbb{Q}}{d\mathbb{P}}(\omega)=\frac{2}{3}$ when $X_1=110$ and $\frac{d\mathbb{Q}}{d\mathbb{P}}(\omega)=\frac{4}{3}$ when $X_1=95$ : this results in the probability of $X_1$ being ""up"" changing from $0.5$ to $\frac{1}{3}$ whilst the probability of $X_1$ being ""down"" changes from $0.5$ to $\frac{2}{3}$ . As a result, we now have: $$\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}[X_1]=\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{P}}\left[X_1\frac{d\mathbb{Q}}{d\mathbb{P}}(\omega)\right]=\frac{1}{2}*\frac{2}{3}*110+\frac{1}{2}*\frac{4}{3}*95=100$$ (note that we have eliminated the ""drift"" via change of measure), whilst we have $$Var^{\mathbb{Q}}(X_1)=\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}[(X_1-100)^2]=\frac{1}{3}*10^2+\frac{2}{3}*5^2=50$$ (note that unfortunately, we have also changed the variance) What worries me further is that this paper shows that the multiplicative Binomial tree model converges to the well-known Geometric-Brownian-Motion (GBM) model when we take the limit in the Binomial tree of time-step converging to zero: and the C-M-G theorem is regularly applied to the GBM model to change measure such that the drift term changes, whilst the Variance remains the same: I therefore assumed that taking the Binomial tree as a toy example would be safe to achieve a similar result (i.e. changing the measure to eliminate ""drift"", whilst preserving the variance of $X_t$ ).

For which functions $f : \mathbb{N}  \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ the process $(f(X_n))_{n\geq0}$ is a martingale (for natural filtration)?

4365869,"$n$ draws with replacement, $n$ unique balls but $f_0$ are equal to $0$, $f_1$ are equal to $1$, and $f_2$ are equal to $2$","I have been looking for several days now how to correctly do the combinatrics of this specific problem (which ends up being very useful for a bootstrapping application of mine).
Here is how it goes: There are $n$ unique balls, each labeled with $0$ , $1$ , or $2$ . Among the $n$ balls, $f_0$ balls are labeled with $0$ , $f_1$ balls are labeled with $1$ , and $f_2$ balls are labeled with $2$ , I perform $n$ draws with replacement, and the order of the balls I picked does not matter. In practice, that means if I have two different balls that are equal to $0$ (let's denote them $0_a$ and $0_b$ ), one equal to $1$ and one equal to $2$ , then $n = 4$ and: $0_a 0_a 0_a 0_a$ is different from $0_a 0_b 0_a 0_a$ but $0_a 0_b 0_a 0_a$ is the same as $0_a 0_a 0_b 0_a$ . Let $M$ denote the mean of the sum of the labels. I'm looking for the distribution of $M$ . $$\begin{align}
    \forall k \in \{0, ..., 2*n\}, \;\; \mathbb{P}\left(M = \dfrac{k}{2*n}\right) & = \dfrac{get_k}{total} \\

    total & = \binom{2n-1}{n}
\end{align}$$ where when $n-k+i < 0$ , the term in the sum of $get_k$ is set to $0$ (happens when we want $k > n$ and we do not consider enough samples with value $2$ ). I am pretty confident the formula for total is correct (total number of different draws that can happen - here it does not matter what value are on the balls) because this is ""textbook"" but i'm pretty sure the $get_k$ formula isn't correct as when I sum it all ( $get_k/total$ ) on Python it doesn't equal to $1$ . I hope i've described the problem quite clearly. I've come up with at least $10$ different formulas for each and I feel like I'm just going circles and I might end up crazy anytime soon. Thanks!

$$ My question is basically twofold: Is there a connection between these two covariant derivatives? Is there a canonical definition of the covariant derivative of a diffeomorphism $\Phi : M \to M$ , or the covariant derivative of its differential $d\Phi : TM \to TM$ ? If $M = \mathbb R^n$ , and we write $Y = Y^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$ and $X = X^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$ , where $X^i, Y^i \in C^\infty(\mathbb R^n)$ for all $i$ (using the Einstein summation convention), then $$\nabla_X Y = (XY^i) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} = \left(X^j \frac{\partial Y^i}{\partial x^j}\right) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}.$$ Applying this to the derivatives above, and using the fact that $(\Phi_* Y)_{\Phi(p)} = d\Phi_p Y_p = Y^j(p)\frac{\partial \Phi^i}{\partial x^j}(p)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\big|_{\Phi(p)}$ , with some abuse of notation, we get: \begin{align*}
\nabla_{X}\left(\Phi_* Y\right) &= \left(X^j \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} \left(Y^k \frac{\partial \Phi^i}{\partial x^k}\right)\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \\

&= \Phi_* \left(\nabla_X Y\right) + (\nabla_X(d\Phi))Y
\end{align*} where formally $\nabla_X(d\Phi) : T_p\mathbb R^n \to T_{\Phi(p)}\mathbb R^n$ is the operator given in coordinates by $$
\nabla_X(d\Phi) = \left(X^j \frac{\partial^2 \Phi^i}{\partial x^j \partial x^k}\right)_{1 \leq i,k\leq n}
$$ which by inspection roughly corresponds to a coordinatewise derivative of the Jacobian matrix of $d\Phi$ in the direction of the vector field $X$ . At a point $p \in \mathbb R^n$ , we can express the equation $\nabla_X \left(\Phi_* Y\right) = \Phi_*(\nabla_X Y) + (\nabla_X(d\Phi))Y$ by writing $$
\nabla_{X_{\Phi(p)}}\left(d\Phi_p Y_p\right) = d\Phi_p\left(\nabla_X Y\right)_p + (\nabla_X(d\Phi))_p Y_p
$$ which seems very similar to the Leibniz ""product rule"". So this all works in $\mathbb R^n$ , but what about more general Riemannian manifolds? Well, formally, given $X, Y$ smooth vector fields and $\Phi : M \to M$ a diffeomorphism, we could simply define $\nabla_X(d\Phi)(Y) = \nabla_X(\Phi_*Y) - \Phi_*(\nabla_X Y)$ , but this seems quite artificial.

4365998,Why is $D(f\circ g)=Df\circ Dg$,"I was reading on Wikipedia about total derivatives of functions and they stated the following about the chain rule for total derivatives: Let $f:\mathbb R^m\to \mathbb R^k$ and $g:\mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^m$ be two differentiable functions and let $a \in \mathbb R^n$ . Let $D_{g(a)}f$ denote the total derivative of $f$ at $g(a)$ and $D_a g$ denote the total derivative of $g$ at a.

I_1 \to \N = \{\{(1,n)\}~|~ n \in \N\}
$$ Let $f \in I_1 \to \N$ be arbitrary. There is $n \in \N$ such that $f =\{(1,n)\}$ . $f(1) = n$ is the only element in $f[I_1]$ , but $n + 1 \in \N$ , which means $f$ is not surjective. inductive step :
Let $n \in \N$ , and assume there is no surjection in $I_n \to \N$ . Let $f \in I_{n+1} \to \N$ be arbitrary. Aiming for contradiction, let $f$ is a surjection.

So let $X$ be a projective nonsingular curve over $\mathbb{C}$ . We have the exponential sequence $$ 0 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X^*\rightarrow 0$$ which gives us a long exact sequence in cohomology, and the first Chern Class is given by $H^1(\mathcal{O}_X^*) \rightarrow H^2(\mathbb{Z})\cong \mathbb{Z}$ . Now a Cech 1-cocycle $\{g_{\alpha\beta}\}$ for a sufficiently fine cover of $X$ in $\mathcal{O}_X^*$ encodes the information of a line bundle, and based on what I have read the image of this in $H^2(\mathbb{Z})$ is given by $\{(\log g_{\alpha\beta} - \log g_{\alpha\gamma} + \log g_{\beta\gamma})/ 2\pi i \}$ where the discrepancies in the choice of logarithm give rise to the cohomology class.

I'm going to try to reduce the scope of my question here in the hope that this isn't closed, because I accept there are other, and most likely superior ways to solve this problem. But I'd like to know if my intuition was correct. The exercise is: Let 𝑋 be a topological space; let $A$ be a subset of $X$ . Suppose that for each $x \in A$ there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U \subset A$ . Show that $A$ is open in $X$ . I know that a set is open if and only if it is a union of open sets, and this is the approach people typically used for this problem. My approach, and thought process, was to use the definition of what it means to be open in the topology generated by a basis (though whether it is ideal to involve a basis is, of course, debatable). If $\mathcal{T}$ is the topology generated by a basis $\mathcal{B}$ , we say $A \in \mathcal{T}$ if and only if for every $x \in A$ , there exists $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subset A$ . So this is what I set out to prove. If I fix $x \in A$ , I know by the assumption in this exercise that I can pick $U \in \mathcal{T}$ , where $x \in U$ and $U \subset A$ . As $U$ is open, I can apply the above definition to find a basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subset U$ . But $U \subset A$ , so I can say $x \in B \subset A$ . By this above definition again, $A$ is open. My question is whether this approach here and my understanding of the basis for a topology is correct, or if I have made any mathematical errors. I surely would have to start out with ""choose a basis for $\mathcal{T}$ ,"" which could just be $\mathcal{T}$ itself. This is certainly not ideal, but is it incorrect?","['general-topology', 'solution-verification']"

4366402,Can we recover the adjacency matrix of a graph from its square?,"For the sake of this question, a graph here has a finite number of vertices, with undirected simple edges, no loop, and no weight or label on edges or vertices. Therefore, its adjacency matrix $A=[a_{i,j}]$ is a symmetric matrix with entries in $\{0,1\}$ , and $0$ on the main diagonal. Assuming that $A^2$ is known, can we recover $A$ ? The question comes from my self-study of graph theory and I have no idea on how to solve this question. What I know: Let's label the vertices of the graph as $v_1$ , $v_2$ , $\dots$ , $v_n$ so that $a_{i,j}=1$ if there is an edge between $v_i$ and $v_j$ , and $0$ otherwise. Then, if $a_{i,j}^{(k)}$ is the entry of $A^k$ at row $i$ and column $j$ , $a_{i,j}^{(k)}$ is the number of walks of length $k$ between $v_i$ and $v_j$ . Therefore, what is known in the problem are the numbers $a_{i,j}^{(2)}$ of common neighbors between $v_i$ and $v_j$ . If the $i$ th row of $A^2$ is composed of $0$ s, then $v_i$ is an isolated point of the graph. (If $v_i$ is not isolated, then there is a walk $v_i-v_j-v_i$ so $a_{i,i}^{(2)}\ge 1$ ). So we can simplify the problem by assuming that the graph has no isolated point. $a_{i,i}^{(2)}=1$ is equivalent to $\deg(v_i)=1$ (end vertex). There are results about square roots of positive semi-definite matrices, but $A^2$ is not positive semi-definite, and the square root would not have its entries in $\{0,1\}$ . For $n=3$ , by looking at the squares of the adjacency matrices of the few possible graphs with $3$ vertices, the answer is yes. In my question, I assume that it is known that $S=A^2$ is the square of the adjacency matrix of a graph and I wonder if there is another graph whose adjacency matrix has also $S$ for square.

4366655,"Space $W$ of null homotopic maps $g \in Hom(S^1, S^1)$ with $g(1)=1$ is contractible.","This is the claim the proof of which I can't fully understand. In my question $S^1$ is defined as subset of complex numbers of unit magnitude.
The proof goes as follows: We can obtain a bijection $V \to W$ , where $V$ is a vector subspace (and thus contractible) of $Hom(S^1, \mathbb{R})$ of functions $f$ with $f(1)=0$ . Bijection is obtained by composing with the function $p: \mathbb{R} \to S^1; x \mapsto \exp(2\pi i x)$ . Function that composes with $p$ on left is denoted as $p_*$ . We want to show that this bijection is open, that is, a homeomorphism. Since it is also a group homomorphism, it suffices to check that an open neighborhood of a neutral element is mapped to an open neighborhood of a neutral element. It is enough to consider sets of form $C(K, U)$ , where $K \subseteq S^1$ is compact and $U \subseteq (-1, 1)$ is an open neighborhood of $0$ . Since $p$ is open, then $p(U) \subseteq S^{-1} \setminus -1$ (why?) is open in $S^1$ . It holds that $p_* C(K, U) = C(K, p(U))$ because of the initial conditions , and it is open. $C(K, U)$ denotes a subbasic open set in compact-open topology. $Hom(S^1, \mathbb{R})$ is a group with pointwise addition, and $Hom(S^1, S^1)$ is a group with pointwise multiplication. Neutral elements in each are constant maps to $0$ and $1$ respectively. I can also prove $W$ is a subgroup of $Hom(S^1, S^1)$ . $p_*$ is continuous because domains are locally compact. Firstly, I don't understand why we only consider $U \subseteq (-1, 1)$ . I also think that the claim that $p(U) \subseteq S^{-1} \setminus -1$ is false, because for it to be true we'd need to have $U \subseteq (-1/2, 1/2)$ . But then we don't consider all possible neighborhoods, and so it doesn't prove that all open sets are mapped to open sets. I also don't get why we need the condition $p(U) \subseteq S^{-1} \setminus -1$ at all. Isn't it enough to just cite that $p$ is open so that $p_* C(K, U) = C(K, p(U))$ is open for an arbitrary $U$ ? And what could possibly initial conditions mean here? Secondly, I'm not really sure why $p_*$ defines a bijection. I think I can argue that null homotopic maps can be lifted, which shows surjectivity, and also that lifts of the same function on differ by an integer constant, so there is only one of them with $f(1)=0$ . Is it enough? By lifting a function $g: X \to S^1$ I mean finding a function $f: X\to \mathbb{R}$ such that $pf=g$ . Two lifts differ by an integer constant because $pf = pf^{\prime}$ implies $pf/pf^{\prime}=1$ , which says that $\exp(2\pi i(f - f^{\prime}))=1$ . I will now write a (special case of) Homotopy lifting property from my textbook that I use for my argument. Let $X$ be a connected topological space, $f: X\to \mathbb{R}$ continuous function and $H: I \times X \to S^1$ a homotopy that starts with $pf$ . Then there is a unique homotopy $F: I\times X \to \mathbb{R}$ that starts with $f$ and $pF = H$ . I used it to say that null homotopic maps can be lifted.
Can it be used to show that $p_*$ is bijective more directly?","['proof-explanation', 'general-topology', 'solution-verification', 'algebraic-topology']"

It is clear that $(n, 2, 1_{1}, 1_{2}, \ldots, 1_{n-2}) \in A_{n}$ which implies that $A_{n} \neq \varnothing$ and there exists a vector $\mathbf{a} \in A_{n}$ such that $m(\mathbf{a}) = n - 2$ .
Besides, for each vector $\mathbf{a} \in A_{n}$ , $m(\mathbf{a}) \leq n-2$ holds. There exists some $n \geq 4$ such that for every vector $\mathbf{a} \in A_{n}$ , $m(\mathbf{a})$ is exactly $n - 2$ .
After my computing, the solution for $n \leq 1000$ with at most $m$ integers greater than $1$ is presented as follow: Specifically, such $n \leq 1000$ satisfying that the number of $1$ in the vector $\mathbf{a} \in A_{n}$ is exactly $n - 2$ is listed as follow:

How can we prove that a point $x\in\mathbb{R}^2$ ""inside the curves"" (the black dot below) is hit by some intermediate curve $H(s,\cdot) = sg+(1-s)f$ ? My own efforts : I think it is hard to formalise the question: one could characterise $x$ by its winding number with respect to the curve $f\circ(-g)$ as this would be 1 (or -1 depending on the orientation). Let us denote this $wnd(x,f\circ(-g))$ . Then $F(s)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^2} wnd(x,H(s,\cdot)\circ(-g))dx$ is a continuous function wrt. $s$ . Furthermore, it is $F(1)=0$ and equal to the area between $f$ and $g$ for $F(0)=0$ . So how could $wnd(x,H(s,\cdot)\circ(-g))$ change for some $s=s_0$ without there being a $t_0$ such that $H(s_0,t_0)=x$ . Another possibility is to use the ""crossing rule"" somehow see this post : the fact that two points on adjacent connected components of the plane (without the curve) differ in winding numbers by exactly 1.

It sometimes happens that I (or my teachers) reverse the order of $f$ and $g$ when describing $g \circ f$ in any of the above ways. Surely, it can't be that both ways are correct.

4366808,How to interpret the constant of integration/endpoints of the sum of derivatives linear operator,"Consider the linear operator expression $$L[f] = f + f' + f'' + f''' + f'''' + ... $$ This doesn't always converge but for some expressions it does converge (such as polynomials or linear combinations of exponentials $e^{ax}$ where $|a| < 1$ ) A natural question to ask is if this operator has a closed form. Using a technique almost identical to the proof of the geometric series combined with integration factors we can see that $$ L[f] - f = \frac{d}{dx}[L[f]] $$ $$ \frac{d}{dx}[L[f]] - L[f] = -f $$ $$  e^{-x} \frac{d}{dx}[L[f]] - e^{-x} L[f] = -e^{-x} f $$ $$ e^{-x} L[f] = - \int e^{-x} f dx $$ $$ L[f] = -e^x \int e^{-x} f dx $$ So this ""closed form"" is not exactly well defined, theres an indefinite integral in there which means it varies by an arbitrary constant. Now if you take a nice polynomial (ex: $x^2$ ) And apply this formula without even understanding it you can end up with a correct answer: $$ L[x^2] = x^2 + 2x + 2 $$ $$ -e^x \int e^{-x} x^2 dx  = -e^x \left( e^{-x} \left( x^2 + 2x + 2 \right) + C \right)$$ And now we just ""set C to 0"" and voila we have perfect agreement. And so while it possible to ""experimentally"" check this formula works, setting C to 0 makes absolutely no sense in the general context of functions. How do you know what C is supposed to be 0? In this case setting $C$ to is 0 is equivalent to saying $f(0)=2$ and how on earth did you know that $f(0)=2$ and not $3$ or something else in general.  You need some initial conditions/ideas on where your bounds start/end. Is there a way to make this formula into something more explicit / rigorous by either defining what the indefinite integral's bounds should be OR by describing a procedure (maybe its not guaranteed to halt in general) that can tell you what value of C is the right value? A possible strategy: If $f(x)$ has an asymptote as $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$ then perhaps the correct $C$ value is one that lets one of these asymptotic values be $0$ . But this is such a frankenstein arbitrary kind of rule. It can be codified as, select $c$ such that $$ \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \int_{c}^{x} e^{-x}f(x) dx  = 0$$ Then that is your integration bound OR if you prefer the language of constants then your additive constant $C = -e^{-c}f(c)$","['indefinite-integrals', 'operator-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

We let $P=Q = 1$ and $R=-1$ to apply the results in the first part. $$g(x) = \sin(2nx)(-4\cos^2(2nx)+2\cos(2nx)+2) $$ $$\iff 2\sin(2nx)(-2\cos^2(2nx)+\cos(2nx)+1)$$ $$\therefore g(x) = 2\sin(2nx)(2\cos(2nx)+1)(-\cos(2nx)+1)$$ Hence $g(x) = 0 \iff 2\sin(2nx)(2\cos(2nx)+1)(-\cos(2nx)+1)=0$ $2\sin(2nx) = 0 \iff 2nx=\pi m \iff x = \frac{\pi m}{2n} $ $\cos(2nx) = -\frac{1}{2} \iff 2nx = \pm \frac{\pi}{3} + (2m+1) \pi \iff x = \pm \frac{\pi}{6nx} + \frac{(2m+1) \pi}{2n}$ $\cos(2nx) = 1 \iff 2nx = 2\pi m \iff x = \frac{2\pi m}{2n}$ We now have 3 general solutions for the roots of $g(x)$ , I am struggling to compare them and come up with an expression that will represent the largest root out of these.","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"

4367107,"Verifying a simple method to use $U(0,1)$ random generators with the CLT to sample from $N(0, 1)$","I am trying to understand an approach that was discussed in my pattern recognition class today of using uniform random variables, which can be sampled using some random generator, to obtain samples that are approximately $N(0,1)$ . Unfortunately there were no notes given so I wish to reproduce what my professor said from my understanding. Knowing that for random variables $X \sim U(0, 1)$ we have $\mu_{X} = 0.5, \sigma_{X}^2 = \frac{1}{12}$ , then consider a random variable $$Y = (\sum_{i=0}^{12} X_i) - 6 $$ $Y$ has $u_{Y}= 0, \sigma_{Y}^2 = 1$ . Now I wish to use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), where according to the Lindeberg-Levy version of the CLT,
if $\{X_1, \ldots, X_n \}$ is a sequence of i.i.d random variables with $\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \mu$ , and $Var[X_i] = \sigma^2 \leq \infty$ , then as $n$ approaches infinite, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(\bar{X} - \mu) $ converges to $N(0, \sigma^2)$ . Then as far as I understand it, by taking $n$ samples of $Y$ , we would have, for sufficiently large $n$ , that $\sqrt{n} * \bar{Y} \sim N(0, 1)$ . Is this algorithm correct? I also see in the wikipedia entry here (the computational methods section) that they do something similar:
""Generate $12$ uniform $U(0,1)$ deviates, add them all up, and subtract $6$ – the resulting random variable will have approximately standard normal distribution"", but they do not further average these values and multiply by $\sqrt{n}$ , so how does the CLT apply here?

This is a popular loss function in econometrics. Given two random $X$ and $Y$ , we may compute the loss of $Y$ relative to a measurable function of $X$ , $f(X)$ , simply by computing $L(Y, f(X))$ . A central problem in statistical decision theory is computing the minimiser of the risk of this loss; namely, we wish to solve the following optimisation problem: $$\arg\min_{f \in L^2} L(Y, f(X)) = \arg\min_{f \in L^2} \mathbb{E} \left( \exp (-(Y- f(X))) + (Y - f(X)) - 1 \right)$$ By considering some simpler cases (e.g. the case where $(X,Y)$ have a density ), one may conjecture that the minimiser is $\hat{f}(X) = - \log \mathbb{E}(e^{-Y}|X)$ . Indeed this paper derives the result in the setting of Bayes estimation. How may one arrive at this result in this setting? A similar problem: A related problem is computing the minimiser for the risk of squared-error loss: $$\arg\min_f \mathbb{E}[ (Y-f(X))^2 ] = \mathbb{E} (Y | X)$$ In this setting, one adds and subtracts $\mathbb{E}(Y|X)$ , expands, then uses properties of conditional expectation to conclude that $\mathbb{E}(Y|X)$ is indeed the minimiser. Indeed: $$\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[(Y - f(X))^2] &= \mathbb{E}[(Y  - \mathbb{E}(Y|X) + \mathbb{E}(Y|X) - f(X))^2] \\
&= \mathbb{E}[(Y  - \mathbb{E}(Y|X))^2] + \mathbb{E}[(\mathbb{E}(Y|X) - f(X))^2] + 2 \mathbb{E}[(Y  - \mathbb{E}(Y|X))(\mathbb{E}(Y|X) - f(X))^2] \\
&= \mathbb{E}[(Y  - \mathbb{E}(Y|X))^2] + \mathbb{E}[(\mathbb{E}(Y|X) - f(X))^2]
\end{align*}$$ where, in the last equality, we used the tower property with conditioning on $X$ to conclude the cross term is zero. At this point it is now evident that $f(X) = \mathbb{E}(Y|X)$ is a minimiser. Perhaps this idea could be extended to the loss function given above?","['statistics', 'statistical-inference', 'conditional-expectation', 'robust-statistics', 'optimization']"
4367177,$\max_{k=1}^{n}|x_k| \xrightarrow[\text{}]{\text{$n \rightarrow \infty$}} \sup_{k=1}^{\infty}|x_k|$,"I want to prove the following:
Let $(x_n)$ be a bounded sequence, then $\max_{k=1}^{n}|x_k| \xrightarrow[\text{}]{\text{$n \rightarrow \infty$}} \sup_{k=1}^{\infty}|x_k|$ . My Calculations: Let $c:=\sup_{k=1}^{\infty}|x_k|$ .
If $c$ is the supremum of $(x_n)$ , then (1) $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}: |x_n| \leq c$ (2) $\forall \epsilon>0 :\exists |x_j|$ such that $|x_j|>c-\epsilon$ Just to clarify it, I am looking at the sequence $(|x_n|)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and NOT at the sequence $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ . This is the reason why I get absolute values in (1) and (2). Now considering the inequality in (2): $|x_j|>c-\epsilon$ , we get $\epsilon > c- |x_j|$ I noticed $\epsilon$ and $c -|x_j|$ are both positive numbers.
This means I can ""take the absolute value"" of the inequality and get $|c- |x_j||<\epsilon $ The inequality I am looking for is $|c-\max_{k=1}^n|x_k||  <\epsilon$ . Now there can be two cases: Case 1: $|x_j|$ is the maximum, i.e $|x_j|=\max_{k=1}^n|x_k|$ and $|x_{n+1}|>|x_j|$ But this just means the inequality still holds. Since $|x_{n+1}|>|x_j|$ it follows that $|c-|x_j||<|c-|x_{n+1}||<\epsilon$ Case 2: $|x_j|$ is the maximum, i.e $|x_j|=\max_{k=1}^n|x_k|$ and $|x_{n+1}|<|x_j|$ In this case nothing changes, since $|x_j|=\max_{k=1}^{n+1}|x_k|$ and the equality $|c- \max_{k=1}^{n+1}|x_k||=|c-|x_j||<\epsilon $ still holds. By this reasoning it follows that, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , there exists a $\epsilon>0$ such that: $|\underbrace{sup_{k=1}^{\infty}|x_k|}_{=c} - \max_{k=1}^n|x_k||<\epsilon$ . The question I would like to ask is: Is this proof right? __________________________________________________________ Edit: One user pointed out that I did not show the definiton of convergence. In fact, I messed up a little bit in the last part. So now the second try: So I looked up the definition.
Let $y_n$ be a sequence and $y \in \mathbb{R}$ . The sequence is convergent if for every $\epsilon>0$ , there exists a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|y_n-y|<\epsilon$ for all $n>N$ So let $\epsilon>0$ . The property of the supremum says that there exists is a $x_j$ such that $|sup_{k=1}^\infty{|x_k|}-\underbrace{max_{k=1}^{N}{|x_k|}}_{=x_j}|<\epsilon_1$ . This means, there exists a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_j=max_{k=1}^{N}|x_k|$ . Choosing N such that the $\epsilon_1$ I get from the supremum is $\epsilon_1 \leq \epsilon$ , then the inequality $|sup_{k=1}^\infty{|x_k|}-max_{k=1}^{N}{|x_k|}|<\epsilon$ holds. Now if $|x_{N+1}|>|x_j|$ , the inequality still holds (Case 1). If $|x_N+1|<|x_j|$ (Case 2), $ x_j=max_{k=1}^{N+1}{|x_k|}$ and the equality still holds. And by induction it is true for all $n \geq N$ . Meaning, $\forall \epsilon >0 :\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|sup_{k=1}^\infty{|x_k|}-max_{k=1}^{N}{|x_k|}|<\epsilon$ for all $n \geq N$","['supremum-and-infimum', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

Why I want to avoid working with $\bf{A^{-1}}$ I know that I can apply power iteration to $\bf{A^{-1}}$ , but I wish to avoid working with this inverse matrix. In my application, $\bf{A}$ is implicitly expressed as $\bf{A} = \bf{K'K}$ with $\bf{K} = \bf{L^{-1}R}$ , where $\bf{L}$ is an $m \times m$ lower triangular band matrix; $\bf{R}$ is an $m \times n$ band matrix of full column rank $(m > n)$ . While $\bf{L}$ and $\bf{R}$ are sparse, $\bf{K}$ and $\bf{A}$ are fully dense. Given that both $m$ and $n$ can be large, I want to explicitly form neither $\bf{K}$ nor $\bf{A}$ . A bad luck is that $m \neq n$ , so that $\bf{R}$ is not square and there is no convenient factor form as $\bf{A^{-1}} = R^{-1}LL'R^{-1\prime}$ . What I have tried With $\bf{A}$ structured as above, it is computationally efficient to compute $\bf{Av}$ for any vector $\bf{v}$ using sparse linear algebra routines. It is easy to compute $\bf{A}$ 's largest eigenvalue $\mu$ using power iteration: $\bf{v_0} = (\frac{1}{n}, \ldots, \frac{1}{n})$ ; $\bf{u_0} = \bf{Av_0}$ ; $\lambda_0 = \bf{v_0'u_0}$ ; for $k = 1, 2, \ldots$ till convergence of $\{\lambda_k\}$ $\bf{v_k} = \bf{u_{k - 1}} / \|\bf{u_{k - 1}}\|$ ; $\bf{u_k} = \bf{Av_k}$ ; $\lambda_k = \bf{v_k'u_k}$ ; return $\lambda_k$ . To find the smallest eigenvalue, I apply this algorithm to $\bf{B} = \bf{A - \mu\bf{I}}$ , inspired by this thread: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/271876/407465 .

Let $d$ be a positive integer. We are given a discrete distribution $\{p_1, \ldots, p_d\}$ . A particle starts walking on $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^{d}$ in the following way: Let $(n_1(t), \ldots, n_d(t))$ be the position of the particle at time $t$ , where $t$ takes discrete integer values, i.e. $t=0, 1, 2, \ldots$ . At each second, it moves one step along the direction of the $i$ -th axis in the probability of $p_i$ (i.e. $(n_1(t), \ldots, n_d(t)) \mapsto (n_1(t), \ldots, n_{i-1}(t), n_{i}(t)+1, n_{i+1}(t), \ldots, n_{d}(t))$ ). Then after $T$ steps (i.e. at the $T$ -th second), the particle moves to the position $(n_1(t), \ldots, n_d(t))$ .

\Delta(t) := \dfrac{1}{d} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{d} (n_i(t) - \overline{N}(t))^2}.

Moreover, we modifiy this with a cliff on the lattice. Let $N > 1$ be an integer. The particle still walks on the lattice in the same way as above, but when it reaches $N$ in any direction $i$ , it will never go forward on that direction (i.e. even in further steps it has a possibility $p_i$ to take a step in direction $i$ , it will remain unmoved in that particular direction.).

4367445,Why is there an unexpected increase in the density of certain types of Goldbach primes?,"Note : Posted in MO since it is unanswered in MSE. I was checking how quickly we can verify Goldbach's conjecture for a given even number $n$ and it was clear that backward starting from the largest prime below $n$ was much faster than a forward search starting from the small odd prime $3$ . I observed the following interesting phenomenon. Let $n$ be an even number and $p$ be the largest prime less than $n$ such that $n-p$ is also a prime. Let $p_k$ be the $k$ -th prime. Then, $p_{\pi(n)-2}$ , $p_{\pi(n)-1}$ and $p_{\pi(n)}$ are the three largest primes preceding $n$ . Now $p$ can either be the largest prime below $n$ , or the prime just before the largest prime or the prime before that and so on. Accordingly, we define: $d_1$ is the density of $n$ such that $p = p_{\pi(n)}$ $d_2$ is the density of $n$ such that $p = p_{\pi(n)-1}$ $d_3$ is the density of $n$ such that $p = p_{\pi(n)-2}$ Data for $n \le 3 \times 10^{10}$ shows that $d_1$ and $d_2$ decreased as $n$ increased. This was intuitively expected as explained in the answer for the related question "" If $p$ is the largest prime less than $2n$ , what is the probability that $2n-p$ is a prime? "". However, quite counter intuitively, $d_3$ increased with $n$ as shown in the graphs below. Question 1 : Why does $d_3$ increase with $n$ while $d_1$ and $d_2$ decreased? Question 2 : What is the limiting value of $d_3$ ? Since $d_3 < 1$ and is increasing, it must converge to a positive limiting value. Note : I have not computed $d_k$ for $k \ge 4$ so I do not know if this increasing trend is observed other values of $k$ . Graphs in normal scale Graphs in $\log n$ scale SageMath code n = 4

4367470,Orientable vs Oriented connected sum,"I am confused about defining the connected sum of two $\color{red}{oriented}$ $n$ -dimensional connected smooth manifolds without boundary, where $n\geq 2$ . Could anyone help me to clear my confusion? I have written some guesses; maybe you can comment on these also. Thanks in advance. So, let $M,M'$ be two connected $\color{blue}{orientable}$ $n$ -dimensional connected smooth manifolds. Let $\varphi\colon \Bbb B^n\hookrightarrow M$ and $\varphi'\colon \Bbb B^n\hookrightarrow M'$ be two smooth embeddings of closed unit balls. Define $$\sharp(M,M'):=\frac{\big(M\backslash \varphi(\text{int }\Bbb B^n)\big)\sqcup \big(M'\backslash \varphi'(\text{int }\Bbb B^n)\big)}{\varphi(p)\sim \varphi'(p),\ p\in \Bbb S^{n-1}}.$$ Question $(1)$ Is $\sharp(M,M')$ always $\color{blue}{orientable}$ ? Question $(2)$ Is it also true that if we $\color{red}{pick\
 orientations}$ for $M,M'$ , then $\color{red}{one\ can\ orient}$ $\sharp(M,M')$ so that orientation of $\sharp(M,M')$ coincides with
the orientation of $M\backslash \varphi(\text{int }\Bbb B^n)$ ? I guess the answers to both questions are positive. I know the following: If we pick orientations for $M, M'$ and choose $\varphi$ as orientation-preserving and $\varphi'$ as orientation-reversing then $\sharp(M, M')$ has a unique orientation that  coincides with the orientations of $M\backslash \varphi(\text{int }\Bbb B^n)$ as well as $M'\backslash \varphi'(\text{int }\Bbb B^n)$ . And the proof is based on the following theorem: Richard Palais Theorem: Let $X$ be a $n$ -dimensional smooth manifold without boundary. (If $X$ is orientable, pick an orientation for $X$ ) Let $\varphi_1,...,\varphi_m\colon \Bbb B^n\hookrightarrow X$ and $\psi_1,...,\psi_m\colon \Bbb B^n\hookrightarrow X$ be two sets of smooth embeddings with pairwise disjoint images (If $X$ is orientable, then we demand that all $\varphi_i,\psi_j$ are orientation-preserving or that all are orientation-reversing). Then there exists an isotopy $F\colon X\times [0,1]\to X$ with $F(-,0)=\text{id}_X$ such that the diffeomorphism $F(-,1)\colon X\to X$ sends $\varphi_i$ to $\psi_i$ , i.e., $F\circ \varphi_i=\psi_i$ for all $i=1,...,m$ . For the following two questions, pick orientations for $M, M'$ and choose both $\varphi,\varphi'$ as orientation-preserving smooth embedding. Question $(3)$ Is it true that if $M$ has an orientation-reversing
diffeomorphism, then $\sharp(M,M')$ is again $\color{blue}{orientable}$ , and $\color{red}{there\ exists\ unique\ orientation}$ for $\sharp(M, M')$ that coincides with the orientations of $M\backslash
 \varphi(\text{int }\Bbb B^n)$ as well as $M'\backslash
 \varphi'(\text{int }\Bbb B^n)$ ? My guess is that it is again true; probably one needs to pick an orientation for $\sharp(M, M')$ that coincides with the orientation of $M'\backslash \varphi'(\text{int }\Bbb B^n)$ . Now, composing an orientation-reversing diffeomorphism $M\to M$ with $F(-,1)\colon M\to M$ (see Richard Palais Theorem), one can produce a diffeomorphic copy of $\sharp(M, M')$ having the same orientation of $\sharp(M, M')$ . Question $(4)$ Is it true that if neither of $M, M'$ has no
orientation-reversing diffeomorphism, then though $\sharp(M, M)$ is $\color{blue}{orientable}$ , it is impossible to $\color{blue}{pick\ an\
 orientation}$ for $\sharp(M,M')$ that coincides with the orientations
of $M\backslash \varphi(\text{int }\Bbb B^n)$ as well as $M'\backslash

4367522,Convergence of double integral involving logarithms and binomials? Can anyone present a simpler proof?,"I am working through a paper I posted to arXiv and am looking to condense my results as well as seek alternative proofs for some of my intermediate results. In particular, I am looking for a shorter proof that gets me to the result of Theorem 1 below. This Theorem was used to justify convergence of a more complicated double integral in my paper. Is Lemma 1 needed at all? Is there a much simpler line of reasoning to get to Theorem 1 ? Lemma 1. For any $n\in\Bbb N_0$ , $$
I_n=\int_0^1\int_0^1(-1)^n\log^n(1-(1-x)(1-y))\,(1-(1-x)(1-y))^{s-2}\,\mathrm dx\mathrm dy,
$$ converges if $s>0$ . Proof. We will first evaluate $I_0$ . Perform the change of variables $(t,v)=((1-x)(1-y),x)$ and integrate over $v$ yielding $$
I_n=\int_0^1(-1)^n\log^n(1-t)(-\log t) (1-t)^{s-2}\,\mathrm dt.
$$ Substituting $n=0$ , we again change variables via $x=1-t$ and then integrate by parts with $u=-\log(1-x)$ and $\mathrm dv=x^{s-2}\,\mathrm dx$ to find $$
I_0=\frac{1}{s-1}\int_0^1\frac{1-x^{s-1}}{1-x}\,\mathrm dx+\log(1-x)\frac{1-x^{s-1}}{s-1}\bigg|_{x=0}^1.
$$ If $s>0$ the limit term vanishes and upon inspection of the integral representation for the harmonic numbers $$
I_0=\frac{H_{s-1}}{s-1}.
$$ Now consider the general case $I_n$ . Without loss of generality assume $n\geq 1$ and perform integration by parts with $u=(-1)^n\log^n(1-t)$ and $\mathrm dv=-\log t(1-t)^{s-2}\,\mathrm dt$ . Expanding the logarithm in $\mathrm dv$ as a power series in $(1-t)$ and integrating termwise we find $$
v=-\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(1-t)^{s+k}}{(s+k)(1+k)}.
$$ In this form, it becomes clear that the limit term $uv|_{t=0}^1$ vanishes if $n\geq 1$ so that $I_n=\int_0^1(-v)\,\mathrm du$ . Furthermore, we observe for $s>0$ : $$
-v=\frac{1}{s}(1-t)^{s-1}\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{s(1-t)^{k+1}}{(s+k)(1+k)}\leq \frac{1}{s}(-\log t)(1-t)^{s-1}.
$$ Hence, $$
I_n\leq\frac{n}{s}\int_0^1(-1)^{n-1}\log^{n-1}(1-t)(-\log t)(1-t)^{s-2}\,\mathrm du=\frac{n}{s}I_{n-1}.
$$ Solving the recurrence relation and calling on the result for $I_0$ we find for $s>0$ : $$
I_n\leq\frac{n!}{s^n}\frac{H_{s-1}}{s-1}<\infty,
$$ Theorem 1. Let $z\in\Bbb R^+$ , $m,n\in\Bbb N_0$ , $a,b\in(-\infty,2]$ , $$
f(x,y,z) =1-\frac{(1-x)(1-y)}{(1-(1-z)x)(1-(1-z) y)},
$$ $$
F(x,y,z,l,s)=(-1)^l(\log\circ f)^l(x,y,z)f^{s-2}(x,y,z),
$$ and $$
I=\int_0^1\int_0^1F(x,y,z,n,a)F(x,y,1,m,b)\,\mathrm dx\mathrm dy.
$$ Then $I$ converges whenever $a+b>2$ . Proof. For convenience we will introduce the auxiliary function $$
J(x,y,z)=\frac{z^2}{(z+(1-z)x)^2(z+(1-z)y)^2}
$$ as well as the following properties: $$
\begin{array}{*2{>{\displaystyle}l}}
(\mathrm{FII}) &\text{$f(\cdot,z)$ is increasing on $z\in\Bbb R^+$ from $f(\cdot,0)=0$ to $f(\cdot,\infty)=1$}.\\[1ex]
(\mathrm{J}) &\text{For all $z\in\Bbb R^+$ and $(x,y)\in[0,1]^2$: $0\leq J(x,y,z)\leq z^{2\operatorname{sign}(z-1)}$}.
\end{array}
$$ Since $n\in\Bbb N_0$ and $a\leq 2$ we are able to deduce from property $(\mathrm{FII})$ that $F(x,y,z,n,a)$ is nonnegative and a decreasing function of $z$ for all $z\in\Bbb R^+$ . Denoting $z^\ast=\min\{1,z\}$ , it follows for all $z\in\Bbb R^+$ $$
I\leq\int_0^1\int_0^1F(x,y,z^\ast,m+n,a+b-2)\,\mathrm dx\mathrm dy.
$$ Performing the change of variables $(1-u,1-v)=((1-x)/(1-(1-z^\ast)x),(1-y),(1-(1-z^\ast)y))$ and then using property $(\mathrm J)$ subsequently gives $$
I\leq\max\{1,z^{-2}\}\int_0^1\int_0^1F(u,v,1,m+n,a+b-2)\,\mathrm du\mathrm dv,
$$ which according to the Lemma 1 converges if $a+b>2$ . The proof is now complete.","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'alternative-proof', 'harmonic-numbers', 'solution-verification']"

I realize that I have to use the formal definition of the limit to get around the fact that $\epsilon$ is a part of the partition's definition, so I tried using supremum definitions to get to something like the following: Denoting the internal sum (i.e. the per-partition variation) by $V(f,P)$ , we want to show that for every $\epsilon'>0$ there exists an $N>0$ such that for all $n>N$ : $$| \sup\big\{V(f,P) \mid \ P \text{ is a partition of } [0, 1]\big\} - \sup\big\{V(f,P) \mid \ P \text{ is a partition of } [\frac{1}{n}, 1]\big\} | <\epsilon'$$ but I'm not sure what to do with the supremums (my inuition is that somehow I can bound this by $|f(\frac{1}{k})-f(0)|$ where $k$ will be chosen such that $|\frac{1}{k}-0|\leq\delta$ and $\delta$ matches $\epsilon'$ from $f$ 's continuity around $0$ , so that we obtain $|f(\frac{1}{k})-f(0)| < \epsilon'$ ), but as I'm a bit rusty on handling supremums in such situations, I'm not sure how to move from the supremums inequality to this. Edit: I think the following comes close to solving it: Let $P$ by a partition of $[\frac{1}{n},1]$ . Denote by $P^+$ the partition of $[0,1]$ such that its first two points are $\{0,\frac{1}{n}\}$ and the remaining are the points in $P$ after $x=\frac{1}{n}$ . Then we have: $$\sup_{P}V(f,P^+)-\sup_PV(f,P)\leq \sup_P\big(V(f,P^+)-V(f,P)\big) \leq \sup_P\big(|f\big(\frac{1}{n}\big)-f(0)|\big)\leq\epsilon'$$ for $n$ sufficiently large, by continuity of $f$ around 0. The first inequality follows from: $$\sup(A+B)=\sup A+\sup B$$ where, in our case: $$A:= V(f,P^+)-V(f,P)$$ $$B:=V(f,P)$$ It doesn't solve it though because the partitions on $[0,1]$ are limited to those of the type $P^+$ .

Since it can be proved that $(\mathcal{P}(X),\tau^w )$ is Polish as it is stated in this other question, it has a countable base, so it follow that $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{P}(X))$ is equal to the smallest sigma algebra that makes all $(L_f)_{f\in C_b(X)}$ measurable, and so we can check the measurability of a Markov Kernel by compounding it with $L_f$ for all $f\in C_b(X)$ , is this right?

\int_X d(x,x_0)\mu_n \to \int_X d(x,x_0) \mu \iff W_p(\mu_n,\mu) \to 0.
\end{align} Now I was wondering, he defines another notion of convergence and he proves that the Wasserstein distance metrize such convergence. But what about the weak topology induced by the functional that define such convergence, that is \begin{align}
\{L_f: f\in C_b(X), x \to d(x,x_0)^p, x_0\in X \}?
\end{align} In general if a distance metrize the weak convergence it is not true that it induces the same topoly, I think about $l^1$ where the strong topology and the weak topology induce the same sequences that converge (as said by Brezis), but the strong and the weak topology are different.
In this case we have a distance that induces the same sequences which converge, but the topology a priori may be different.
When Villani talks about continuity and $lsc$ about $W_p$ , in chapter 6, he always intend sequential continuity and sequential semicontinuity right? He never speak about the weak topology or am I wrong?
When he talks about the fact that $\mathcal{P}_p(X)$ is Polish, he intends with respect to the topology induced by the Wasserstein right? Not the weak topology induced by the functionals?
However, we are interested in mesurability, so if we see just the sigma algebra generated by the $W_p$ and the borel sigma algebra on $\mathcal{P}_p(X)$ , they are the same I think, and it can be proved by using exactly the $lsc$ with respect to the weak topology on $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and the fact that such topology is metrizable and separable, as I said above.
Does it follow in some easy way that the borel sigma algebra of the functionals is the same as the borel sigma algebra of the Wasserstein metric? We just need to prove that $W_p$ metrizes the weak convergence and we have the equality between sigma algebras? More generally, let us consider a set $Y$ with some functional $(L_f,f\in \mathcal{F})$ that induces the weak topology $\tau^w$ on $Y$ ,and it induces a weak convergence on $Y$ given by \begin{align}
y_n \rightharpoonup y \iff L_f(y_n)\to L_f(y), \hspace{0.3cm} \forall f\in \mathcal{F}.
\end{align} Let us suppose that we succed to find a distance $d$ that metrize the weak convergence, that is \begin{align}
y_n \rightharpoonup y \iff d(y_n,y) \to 0.
\end{align} When it is true that the borel sets of the weak convergence, the borel sets of the distance $d$ , and the smallest sigma algebra that makes $(L_f,f\in\mathcal{F})$ measurable are equal? That is we have \begin{align}
\mathcal{B}(\tau^w) = \mathcal{B}(d) = \sigma( L_f,f\in\mathcal{F} ) ?
\end{align} I think that we may need that $d$ induces a metric space searable, but what else?","['measure-theory', 'weak-convergence', 'measurable-functions', 'weak-topology', 'probability']"

Then I learnt a very useful trick to evaluate the integral. Noting that $$I(1):= \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{d x}{x^{4}-x^{2}+1} \stackrel{x \mapsto \frac{1}{x}}{=} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{2}}{x^{4}-x^{2}+1}
$$ Combining them yields \begin{aligned}
I(1)&=\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{2}+1}{x^{4}-x^{2}+1} d x\\&= \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1+\frac{1}{x^{2}}}{x^{2}+\frac{1}{x^{2}}-1} d x \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{d\left(x-\frac{1}{x}\right)}{\left(x-\frac{1}{x}\right)^{2}+1} \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\tan ^{-1}\left(x-\frac{1}{x}\right)_{0}^{\infty} \\
&= \frac{\pi}{2}
\end{aligned} Later, I started to investigate the integrands with higher powers. Similarly, $$
I(2):= \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{d x}{\left(x^{4}-x^{2}+1\right)^{2}} \stackrel{x \mapsto \frac{1}{x}}{=}\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{6}}{\left(x^{4}-x^{2}+1\right)^{2}} d x
$$ By division, we decomposed $x^6$ and obtain $$
\frac{x^{6}}{\left(x^{4}-x^{2}+1\right)^{2}}=\frac{x^{2}+1}{x^{4}-x^{2}+1}-\frac{1}{\left(x^{4}-x^{2}+1\right)^{2}}

In this way, a function is a variable because the variable y is a function. But here I found another definition: A function is a relationship between a set of inputs and outputs, where each input produces only one output. And it says that a function is a relationship . I even saw that such a function $f : X \to Y$ can even be defined as a set of ordered pair $\{(x,y)|x \in X \land y \in Y \}$ . Doesn't this mean that a function is a set ?

Consider the topological space $(\mathbb{R},\tau_{e})$ , the real line with the euclidean topology.
I want to prove the interval $(0,1)$ is not compact by definition, so it is enough to show an open cover where no finite subcover can exist. Consider the set of intervals $\left\{ \left(0, 1 - \dfrac{1}{n} \right)\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ . I say they form an open cover. I already proved open intervals are open, so it remains to prove they are indeed a cover, i.e., that $(0,1) \subseteq \displaystyle \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( 0, 1 - \dfrac{1}{n} \right)$ . In fact, take $x \in (0,1)$ . Then $x< 1$ , so $\dfrac{1}{1-x}>0$ , then, by the archimedean property, there is $N$ natural such that $N > \dfrac{1}{1-x}$ , so $\dfrac{1}{N} < 1-x$ and then $x < 1 - \dfrac{1}{N}$ . So $x \in \left ( 0, 1 - \dfrac{1}{N} \right)$ , and of course this is one of the intervals in the set of intervals, hence the set is a cover. Now I say that it is impossible to extract a finite subcover, because if $M$ is a natural such that $(0,1) \subseteq \displaystyle\bigcup_{n=1}^{M} \left(0, 1 - \dfrac{1}{n} \right) =\emptyset \cup\left(0,\dfrac12 \right) \cup \dots \left(0, 1 - \dfrac{1}{M} \right)$ , then take $x$ such that $1 - \dfrac{1}{M}<x<1$ (which can be taken by the density of real numbers), so $x$ is an element of $(0,1)$ that is not in the finite subcover, hence the impossibility.
