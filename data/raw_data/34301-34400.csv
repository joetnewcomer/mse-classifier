326891,Basic question about analyticity vs. differentiability in complex analysis.,"In chapter $V$ of Palka, ""Consequences of the Local Cauchy Integral Formula,"" 3.1 .  If a function $f$ is analytic in an open set $U$, then $f'$ is analytic in $U$.  In particular, $f$ belongs to the class $C^1(U)$. I was surprised to read this because I thought we'd established this fact long ago with the Cauchy-Riemann equations.  Isn't that the whole thing about complex differentiability - that a function is infinitely differentiable whenever it's differentiable once?  Obviously there is something fundamental I'm misunderstanding here about the difference between analyticity and differentiability, because I don't understand why these two statements are different. Can someone please explain to me what is different about these two statements in detail, and in particular, the motivation for why this is (as Palka notes) a ""striking theoretical consequence""?","['analyticity', 'complex-analysis', 'definition']"

326944,Evaluating eigenvalues of a product of two positive definite matrices,"Let $A,B\in M_n(\mathbb{R})$ be two symmetric positive definite matrices, i.e.: $$\forall x\in\mathbb{R}^n, x\neq 0, (Ax,x)>0, (Bx,x)>0,$$ where $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the usual scalar product in $\mathbb{R}^n$. It is equivalent to saying that eigenvalues of A and B are strictly positive (and there exists an orthonormal eigenbasis for both matrices). We order these eigenvalues which are not necessarily distinct: $$\lambda_1(A)\leq ...\leq\lambda_n(A)$$ and $$\lambda_1(B)\leq ...\leq\lambda_n(B).$$ It is not hard to prove the minimax principle for these eigenvalues: $$\lambda_k(A)=\min_{\substack{F\subset \mathbb{R}^n \\ \dim(F)=k}} \left( \max_{x\in F\backslash \{0\}} \frac{(Ax,x)}{(x,x)}\right).$$ For $\lambda_1(A)$ and $\lambda_n(A)$ we have simpler expressions: $$\lambda_1(A)=\min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\}} \frac{(Ax,x)}{(x,x)}\hspace{1cm}\text{and}\hspace{1cm}\lambda_n(A)=\max_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\}} \frac{(Ax,x)}{(x,x)}.$$ We now consider the matrix $AB$. It is possible to prove that the eigenvalues of $AB$ are the same as for the matrix $\sqrt{B}\cdot A\cdot \sqrt{B}$, where $\sqrt{A}$ denotes the unique square root matrix of $A$: $\sqrt{A}$ is real, symmetric, positive definite and $\sqrt{A}\cdot \sqrt{A}=A$. The eigenvalues of $AB$ are hence real and strictly positive. We order them similarly like we did for A and B. Prove that, $\forall 1\leq k\leq n$: $$\lambda_k(A)\lambda_1(B)\leq \lambda_k(AB)\leq \lambda_k(A)\lambda_n(B).$$ Note that we cannot use the minimax principle for the $\lambda_k(AB)$ since $AB$ is not necessarily symmetric. However, the hint of the exercise suggests we use the the minimax principle at some point. References to some books? Any thoughts how I should attack the problem? Maybe I am missing some obvious observations?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

Consider, for example, the sequence in $\mathbb Z_4$: $$1,1,2,3,1,0,1,1,2,3,1,0,\dots$$ Is there a nice way to describe the length of the sequence that results before repeating?  Clearly, it must be less than $n^2$, since that would cycle through all possible combinations of $a,b$ with $a,b \in \mathbb Z_n$, and once you repeat two combinations, you have a cycle. \begin{align*}
\mathbb Z_2: 1,1,0,\dots & 3 \\

I think the idea behind the argument must be easy, but I am somehow missing it. I do see that $\sum_{k=1}^n k^{-1}$ can be taken as a sort of approximation, using areas of rectangles, to $\int_1^n \frac{1}{x}dx = \ln(n)$. So maybe the argument uses the integral comparison test?

327067,Information-theoretic aspects of mathematical systems?,"It occured to me that when you perform division in some algebraic system, such as $\frac a b = c$ in $\mathbb R$, the division itself represents a relation of sorts between $a$ and $b$, and once you calculate this relation, the resulting element $c$, being 'merely' the relation or some kind of representation of it, has lost the information about what either $a$ or $b$ may have been. So division destroys or weakens information. Other operations have similar peculiarities. Multiplication such as $a b = c$ is very 'lossy' in $\mathbb R$, but not as lossy in $\mathbb N$ since the set of possible divisors of $c$ is finite. So my question is, are there any formalizations which account for (or may be able to account for) this particular aspect of mathematical operations (or functions/relations in general)?","['information-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'combinatorics']"

327120,Understanding branch cuts for functions with multiple branch points,"My question was poorly worded and thus confusing.

My question is, if for every function $f$ with the intermediate value property exists a function $F$ such that $F'=f$.  And if so, is $F$ unique (up to a constant you may add)? My attempts till now: (Just skip them if you feel so) The most natural way of finding those functions would be integrating, so I guess the question can be reduced to, if functions with the intermediate value property can be integrated. This one depends heavy on how you define when a functions is integrable, we (my analysis class) said that we call a function integrable when it is a regulated function (the limits $x\to x_0^+ f(x)$ and $x\to x_0^- f(x)$ exists ) . As my example above shows, not every function with the intermediate value property is a regulated function. But if we say a function is integrabel when every riemann sum converges the above function is integrable, so it seems like this would be a better definition for my problem. Edit: As Kevin Carlson points out in a commentar that being a derivative is different from being riemann integrable, he even gave an example for a function which is differentiable but it's derivative is not riemann integrable. So we can't show that those functions are riemann integrable as they  are not riemann integrable in general. Now I have no clue how to find an answer.","['examples-counterexamples', 'real-analysis']"

Hence we have $ T_1(\psi)= \int_\mathbb{R}\psi dx = 0 $, so for $ \tau(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x \psi(t)dt $ we have $ \psi = \tau'$. Hence if $ T' = 0 $ then
$$ T(\varphi ) = T(\tau') + T(\varphi_0)T_1(\varphi) = T(\varphi_0)T_1(\varphi) = T_{T(\varphi_0)}(\varphi) $$ Thus $ T = T_{T(\varphi_0)} $. But I can't replicate this on $\mathbb{R}^n$.

327401,Prove that line through intersection of line through foots of heights and opposite line and orthocenter is perpendicular to median.,"$BB'$ and $CC'$ are heights of a given $\triangle ABC$ ($AB\ne AC$). $M$ is mid-point of $BC$ and $H$ is orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$ and $D$ is intersection of lines $B'C'$ and $BC$. Prove $DH \perp AM$. My idea is to prove that $AC'EHB'$ (or $C'BME$ or $B'EMC$) is cyclic. I tried lots of things, but I think the main thing I lacked in all my deductions if usage of $M$ being a mid-point. Other idea is to prove that $H$ is orthocenter of $\triangle AMD$, since we already have $AH\perp MD$, it's enough to prove $MH\perp AD$. If $MH\cap AD=\{G\}$, then we should prove that $G$ lies on circle around $AC'(E)HB'$. So another idea would be to prove that some of triangles ""composed"" of $A,C',E,H,B',G$ with at least once vertices being $E$ or $G$ has circumradius $AH/2$. Some trigonometry? Another idea would be to mark $E'$ as foot of height from $D$ to $AM$ and then use Menelaus theorem to prove that $A-H-E'$, that is, $E\equiv E'$. EDIT. The only place where I think I can use the fact that $M$ is midpoint of $BC$ is that $BM=C'M=B'M=CM$, so there are some equal angles. It should help us prove $E$ lies on circumcircle of $\triangle C'BM$, that is, $C'BME$ is cyclic, because we have $\angle MC'B=MBC'$. It's also interesting to notice that once we prove $E$ lies on mentioned circle, we'd conclude that $DE$ is bisector of $\angle C'EB$, which might be a clue but I still can't figure anything out. EDIT 2. I also thought about using the fact that $\triangle CMA$ and $\triangle BMA$ have same areas. Then we have $AC\sin\alpha_1=BC\sin\alpha_2$ where $\alpha_1=\angle CAM=\angle CAE$ and $\alpha_2=\angle BAM=\angle BAE$, so we might be able to use that somehow for the idea about circumradius being $AH/2$, because we can use sine laws on triangles $\triangle AC'E$ and $AEB'$ (we need to prove $\angle C'EA=\angle B=\beta$ and/or $\angle B'EA=\angle C=\gamma$), from which we might reduce this to proof about similarity of some triangles. Seems like a nice idea that could work but I can't seem to get much from it for now. Another thing, about the idea of proving that $H$ is orthocenter of $\triangle AMD$. I'm not sure is it better to mark $MH\cap AD=\{G\}$ and prove $MH\perp AD$, or other way around? Or maybe to mark intersection of $AD$ and circumcirle of $AC'HB'$ and $\triangle ABC$ (maybe this is important?) as $G$ and then prove $H\in GM$? Just adding ideas, since I can't seem to get anywhere, almost like we lack just a little bit something and all of the ideas might actually work very similarly. Also, since people wondered if it's Olympiad problem or homework problem: it's from Serbian mathematical magazine for high schoolers, it's in the section where one of the hardest problems are.

327411,A question about a proof in one of Sierpiński's papers,"The following is a question about Sierpiński's paper ""Une démonstration du théorème sur la structure des ensembles de points"", ( link ): We call a set dense-in-itself if it does not contain any isolated points. An isolated point $x$ is a point for which a neighbourhood exists that does not contain points of the set other than $x$. Let $C$ be a subset of $\mathbb R$ such that it does not contain any dense-in-itself subsets. Using an enumeration of the countable basis consisting of the balls $B(q,\frac{1}{n})$ we can show (without using the axiom of choice) that there exists a function $\varphi$ that picks a point $p$ in $C$. We can define $\varphi$ by observing that there is at least one ball that only contains one point of $C$. Define $\varphi$ to return the first point in the enumeration of the basic calls such that the ball contains no other points of $C$. $\varphi$ is a well-defined function on all subsets of $C$. It seems to me that $\varphi$ therefore is a choice function for $C$ and furthermore that it yields a enumeration of $C$. In the paper he sets $p_0 = \varphi (C)$ and then goes on to define families $\mathcal K$ of subsets of $C$ with the properties (i)   $\{p_0\} \in \mathcal K$ (ii) if $A_i$ in $\mathcal K$ then $\bigcup_i A_i \in \mathcal K$ (iii) if $E \subsetneq C$ is in $\mathcal K$  then $E \cup \varphi (C \setminus E)$ is also in $\mathcal K$. He uses $\mathcal K$ to give a proof that $C$ with the above property is enumerable without using the axiom of choice and without using transfinite induction. My question is: Does effective enumerability of $C$ not immediately
  follow from the fact that $\varphi$ is a choice function for $C$ (via
  transfinite induction)? I suspect I might be using some form of choice in my thoughts without being aware of it. Thanks for your help.","['general-topology', 'axiom-of-choice']"

327453,Properties of the Category of topological spaces with $n$ basepoints.,"I've recently encounted a problem in my reading which would seem to be more naturally phrased if the category we work in shifted from the category $\textbf{Top}^*$ of pointed topological spaces, to the category $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ of topological spaces with an ordered set of $n$ distinct basepoints and continuous maps between them which preserve the ordered basepoint set. Let $X$ be a topological space and let $A=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}\subseteq X$ be it's baspoint set for some finite natural number $n$. I'm particularly interested in the homotopy of these spaces and so I feel it is probably natural to consider the relative fundamental groupoid $\pi_1(X,A)$ of these spaces. I don't know too much about the fundamental groupoid of a space though other than basic definitions. I wonder if someone could outline what properties we gain and lose by considering the category $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ instead of the category $\textbf{Top}^*$. For instance, this category still has an initial object which is just the finite set of $n$ elements with the discrete topology however, I don't believe $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ has terminal objects. This category still has a coproduct given by identifying the basepoint sets of two objects element-wise with respect to their order (a kind of wedge product at $n$ points) but it's not clear that we still have products. How might these properties change if we loosen our category to include maps which possibly permute the ordering of the basepoint set? Also how does the fundamental groupoid functor $\pi_1(.,A)$, which takes an object in $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ to its fundamental groupoid $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ relative to its basepoint set $A$, differ from the usual fundamental group functor. If there is a functor which takes an object in $\textbf{Top}^{*n}$ to $\textbf{Top}^*$, does this induce a functor $\textbf{Grpd}_n\rightarrow \textbf{Grp}$ from the category of groupoids with $n$ objects to the category of groups (possibly via classifying spaces?)?

The associated long exact sequence is as follows $$0\to H^0(\mathcal{I}_X/\mathcal{I}^2_X) \to H^0(\mathcal{O}_{X_2}) \to H^0(\mathcal{O}_{X}) \to$$ $$\to H^1(\mathcal{I}_X/\mathcal{I}^2_X) \to H^1(\mathcal{O}_{X_2}) \to H^1(\mathcal{O}_X) \to 0$$ Clearly the support of $\mathcal{I}_X/\mathcal{I}^2_X$ is $X.$ Intuitively, $\mathcal{I}_X/\mathcal{I}^2_X \cong \mathcal{L}^{\vee}$ where $\mathcal{L}$ is the locally free sheaf of sections of $L \to X,$ which I need to make it precise! By Serre's duality, (or the special case of Kodaira's vanishing theorem for curves) for the assumption $\text{deg}L >2g-1,$ we get $H^0(\mathcal{L}^{\vee})=0,$ hence by Riemann-Roch $h^0(\mathcal{L}^{\vee})-h^1(\mathcal{L}^{\vee})=\text{deg} \mathcal{L}^{\vee} +1-g,$ we obtain $h^1(\mathcal{L}^{\vee})=g+d-1.$ Also, $h^0(\mathcal{O}_X)=1$ since $X$ is smooth projective, $h^1(\mathcal{O}_X)=g.$ Since the alternating sum of $h^i$s is zero in the above long exact sequence, we will have, $p_a(X_2)=h^1(\mathcal{O}_{X_2})=2g+d-2+h^0(\mathcal{O}_{X_2}).$ Now, What is $h^0(\mathcal{O}_{X_2})?$ where $X_2$ is a projective non-reduced curve.

The same holds in one higher dimension: the volume of a sphere is $\frac{4}{3} \pi r ^3$ and the derivative of this is the surface area: $4\pi r^2$. These make sense to me geometrically - if you increase the volume by a tiny bit $dr$, the increase in volume will be in proportion to the surface area. The generalized stokes theorem says that for a $(k-1)$-form $\omega$ on a $k$-dimensional manifold $M$ with boundary: $$\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega$$ Here, the derivative is the volume form -- which is the opposite of what I observed from the geometric formulas above.

Suppose I have an algebraic space $\mathcal{A}$ and two morphisms $f_i:S\rightarrow\mathcal{A}$ such that for every closed point $\operatorname{Spec}(k)\rightarrow S$ the induced maps $f_i|_{\operatorname{Spec}(k)}\rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ agree. Suppose $S$ is a reduced scheme with $\operatorname{Spec}(k)$ points which are dense in $S$. Must $f_1=f_2$? If not is there a condition we can impose on the algebraic space so this holds?

327737,Magnetic fields and the complex plane,"The electrostatic potential $\varphi$ must satisfy Laplace's equation in regions without charge: $$\nabla^2 \varphi = 0.$$ If there is no $z$ dependence in the problem we are solving, we can choose the real or complex part of a holomorphic function to be an acceptable potential. I am interested in the analogy of this setup for magnetic fields.  If you have a current carrying wire perpendicular to a plane, then the contour integral of the magnetic field in the plane on a closed loop $\gamma$ will be $$\int_\gamma \vec{B}\cdot \vec{dr} = \mu_0 I$$ where $\mu_0$ is a constant and $I$ is the current in the wire.  In the plane, the magnetic field is a 2-dimensional vector field, so this expression is reminiscent of the residue theorem: indeed, we can pick a complex function $b(z)$ with a simple pole at the location of the wire which gives the magnetic field at any point $z$ in the plane. My questions are What are the hypotheses here, as in when can we describe the magnetic field in a plane by a meromorphic function? Is there a generalization of differentiable complex functions that have nonzero curl over a region?  Specifically, can we model not only the field due to a wire, but also the field due to a region of penetrating current density?
