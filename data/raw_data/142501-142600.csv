2311541,Why can bases of number systems not be rational numbers?,"This is a question that keeps bothering me: much of mathematics was created by extending rules to new domains e.g. negative numbers were created by consistently extending arithmetic beyond positive integers. However, with number bases it seems impossible to do this. Number bases are integers, but could they be rational numbers? I've had previous discussions about this, see here . One problem can be seen with this example: in base 2.5, 0.22 is greater than one. That's not what we want! What, if anything, can be done about this? EDIT: To put it another way - if every positional number is less than any digit to its left, why doesn't this apply to fractional base positional numbers?","['number-theory', 'decimal-expansion', 'elementary-number-theory']"

2311673,Two properties of surface integrals.,"Let $\Omega$ be a bounded open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $C^1$ boundary. I know the following (possible) definition for $$\int_{\partial\Omega}u\,d\sigma.$$
For each $x_0\in\partial\Omega$, there exist an open subset $U$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing $x_0$, an open subset $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and a $C^1$ function $g:A\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that its graph is $G_g=\partial\Omega\cap U$. By compactness of $\partial\Omega$, we can write $\partial\Omega=\cup_{j=1}^N U_j$, where each $U_j$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $\partial\Omega\cap U_j=G_{g_j}$, where $g_j:A_j\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is $C^1$. Take a partition of unity $\{\eta_j\}_{j=1}^N$ corresponding to $\{U_j\}_{j=1}^N$: $\eta_j\in C_c^{\infty}(U_j)$, $0\leq\eta_j\leq 1$ and $\sum_{j=1}^N\eta_j=1$ on $\partial \Omega$. Let $u:\partial\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ measurable. Define $u_j=u\,\eta_j$, which has support in $U_j$. Then:
$$\int_{\partial\Omega}u\,d\sigma=\sum_{j=1}^N\int_{A_j}u_j(x',g_j(x'))\sqrt{1+|\nabla g_j(x')|^2}\,dx'$$(whenever the right-hand side exists). My two doubts are the following: Given a subset $\Gamma$ of $\partial\Omega$, in what sense it is understood $\int_\Gamma u\,d\sigma$? Is it true that $$\int_{\partial\Omega}u\,1_\Gamma\,d\sigma=\int_\Gamma u\,d\sigma\,?$$

If $u_m\rightarrow u$ in $L^p(\partial\Omega)$, is it true that there exists a subsequence $u_{m_k}$ that converges pointwise almost everywhere on $\partial\Omega$?","['surface-integrals', 'lebesgue-integral', 'differential-geometry', 'vector-analysis']"

2311692,How many infinite subsets does $\mathbb N$ have?,"I attempted to write a derivation of the answer, but was told my mathematics was wrong; please correct me. The cardinality of $\mathbb N$ is $\aleph_0$. From this set, we can generate another infinite subset by excluding $1$ element. There are $\aleph_0$ such possible subsets that can be generated like this. We can generate an infinite subset by excluding $2$ elements from $\mathbb N$. There are $\aleph_0 \choose 2$ possible subsets that can be generated like this. In general, for any $i$ from $0$ to $\aleph_0$ we can generate $\aleph_0 \choose i$ such possible subsets by excluding $i$. To find the total number of possible subsets, we simply sum all the combinations. $$\sum_{i = 0}^{n} {n \choose i} = 2^n$$ Based on the above:
$$\sum_{i = 0}^{\aleph_0} {\aleph_0 \choose i} = 2^{\aleph_0}$$ $2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1$ $\therefore$Â  the number of infinite subsets of $\mathbb N$ is $\aleph_1$. I realise that I excluded the number of infinite subsets who have infinite complements. To account for this, merely combine any $k$ $i$ used in the selection above, and exclude all multiples of the products of $i_1*i_2*i_3*...*i_k$. We have $\aleph_0$ such sets of $i$ with numbers increasing from $0$ to $\aleph_o$. I didn't consider this when I first wrote it out, and only realised it after. I haven't yet updated my proof to include it. However, this wasn't the problem with my proof; I was told I did ""bad mathematics"".",['elementary-set-theory']

2311736,Automorphisms of matrix rings,"I am trying to classify automorphisms of matrix rings.  I was surprised to be able to find little on the subject by searching (here or elsewhere) though this could be an indication of my poor searching skills rather than the lack of material. For the moment, I am looking at matrices over a field but I am trying to be as general as possible about the field: not necessarily $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ or even necessarily of characteristic $0$ . I am not sure whether it is standard but I am only interested in automorphisms which in a sense preserve the field.  More exactly, they should have this property: $$\phi(\lambda M) = \lambda\phi(M)$$ I am most interested in automorphisms due to the matrix structure rather than ones which are in a sense inherited from the field. One obvious class of automorphisms is those of the form: $$A \rightarrow P^{-1}AP$$ where $P$ is invertible. Now, I need to either find others or prove that all must have this form. After trying and failing for a while to prove that all must have this form, I started to look for counterexamples.  I found a partial one.  For $M_2(\mathbb{R})$ , the automorphism: $$
\left(\begin{matrix}
        x_{11} & x_{12} \\
        x_{21} & x_{22} \\
        \end{matrix}\right) 
\rightarrow
\left(\begin{matrix}
        x_{11} & -x_{12} \\
        -x_{21} & x_{22} \\
        \end{matrix}\right) 
$$ [This was originally mistyped giving the appearance that it was only defined for symmetric matrices.] cannot be expressed in this form but if I extend to $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ it can with $$ P = 
\left(\begin{matrix}
        i & 0 \\
        0 & -i \\
        \end{matrix}\right) 
$$ So, I may need to consider whether allowing extensions of the field would cover all automorphisms.  The question now becomes: are all automorphisms of this form if field extensions are allowed or can I find a counterexample to that. My attempts mostly involve considering possible images of simple matrices e.g. ones with a single entry of $1$ and otherwise $0$ . This is not homework, I am long past that.  It is an old man doing self-imposed brain exercise. Some hints rather than a complete answer would be appreciated since the purpose is to exercise my brain.","['matrices', 'ring-theory', 'field-theory']"
2311754,Tangent space of circle at a point,"I am trying to compute tangent space of $S^1=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: x^2+y^2=1\}$ at a point say $(1,0)=p$. As $S^1\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$  we see that $\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\bigg|_p,\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\bigg|_p\right\}$ are elements of $T_pS^1$. As $S^1$ is one dimensional, we see that $\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\bigg|_p,\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\bigg|_p\right\}$ is a linearly dependent set when seen as elements of $T_pS^1$ i.e., for some $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$ we have $$a\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\bigg|_p+b\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\bigg|_p=0$$ as functions $C_p^{\infty}(S^1)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

2311939,Whatâs the relation between local diagonalisation of Riemannian metrics and the eigenprojections for the representation matrix functions?,"Recently, the topic of smooth diagonalisation of Riemannian metrics came to my interest. Namely, I've read through this paper from Duke Math. J.
Volume 51, Number 2 (1984), 243-260 (unfortunately the document doesn't seem to be publicly available). In Theorem 4.2, they state and prove the following: Let $(M^3, g)$ be a three-dimensional $C^\infty$ Riemannian manifold. Then there is an atlas of $C^\infty$ coordinate charts for $M$ such that, in each chart, the metric is diagonal, i.e. $$d s^2 = \lambda_1(x, y, z) d x^2 + \lambda_2 (x, y, z) d y^2 + \lambda_3 (x, y, z) d z^2$$ They furthermore make a similar statement for the case $n = 2$ , namely that for two-manifolds, one has always coordinates in which the metric locally takes the form $$d s^2 = \lambda(x, y) (d x^2 + d y^2)$$ As someone for who Riemannian manifolds are a relatively fresh topic, I'm still confused by how one can understand and interpret this property of diagonalisation and how one can actually diagonalize in practice. First and foremost, I've been trying to wrap my head around the following: let's take a fixed point $p \in M$ and consider the metric $g_p$ at this point $p$ , and let $T(x)$ be it's representation as a matrix, where $x \in T_pM$ . From my understanding, the diagonalisation of $g_p$ would then be equipvalent to finding smooth eigenprojections for the representation matrix $T(x)$ . However, even for a smooth matrix function $T(x)$ , the eigenspaces and eigenprojections do not need to behave smoothly or even exist everywhere. I found the following example in this book by Kato, Â§5.3: Let $n = 2$ , and: $$T(x) = e^{- \frac 1{x^2}} \pmatrix{\cos \frac 2x & \sin \frac 2x \\ \sin \frac 2x & - \cos \frac 2x}, T(0) = 0$$ Then $T(x)$ is continuous and indefinitely differentiable for all real values of $x$ , and the eigenvalues of $T(x)$ which turn out to be $\pm e^{- \frac 1 {x^2}}$ (for $x \neq 0$ ) and $0$ (for $x = 0$ ) are continuous and indefinitely differentiable aswell. However, the eigenprojections for $x \neq 0$ in this case are: $$ \pmatrix{\cos^2 \frac 1x & \cos \frac 1x \sin \frac 1x \\ \cos \frac 1x \sin \frac 1x & \sin^2 \frac 1x}, \pmatrix{ \sin^2 \frac 1x & - \cos \frac 1x \sin \frac 1x \\ - \cos \frac 1x \sin \frac 1x & \cos^2 \frac 1x}$$ These matrix functions are continuous and indefinitely differentiable on any interval that doesn't contain $0$ , but they cannot be continued to $x = 0$ as continuous functions. Also, one can show that there doesn't exist any eigenvector of $T(x)$ that is continuous in the neighborhood of $x = 0$ and doesn't vanish in $x = 0$ . Sorry for this rather tedious example, but now my question is: Why is this not a contradiction to the diagonalisation? If according to Deturck and Yang all Riemannian metrics are locally diagonalizable for $n = 2, 3$ , then why are there matrix functions like these that are not smoothly diagonalizable? Do these metric diagonalisations not correspond to finding the respective eigenprojection functions of the local metrix representation, and if so, why not? Or if there something else that I'm missing? Any help would be much appreciated âÂ maybe I'm just missing something very simple.

I want to integrate the function $f(z) := \frac{\log(z)}{z^2+a^2}$ along the contour $C:= \gamma_1 \cup \gamma_2 \cup \gamma_3 \cup \gamma_4$ constisting of to semicircles with center at 0 around the upper half plane and radius $R$ and $\epsilon$ (resp.) as well as the intervals $[-R, -\epsilon]$ and $[\epsilon, R]$. For the complex logarithm, use the branch $\log z = \log|z| + i\theta, \theta \in [-\pi/2, 3\pi/2)$ so we don't get any problems on the real line (is this choice correct?). Note that I have one pole in my contour, namely $z = ia$. The Residue theorem yields $$\int_C f(z) dz= 2\pi i \text{ Res}(f, ia) = 2\pi i\lim_{z\to ia}(z-ia) \frac{\log z}{(z-ia)(z+ia)} = 2\pi i\frac{\log(ia)}{2ia} = \pi \frac{\log(a)+ i\pi/2}{a}$$
Proceeding, we choose the following parametrizations: $$\gamma_1 : [-R,0]  \to \mathbb C, \quad t\mapsto -\frac{\epsilon t}{R} + (t-\epsilon) \\ \gamma_2 : [0, R] \to \mathbb C, \quad t\mapsto -\frac{\epsilon t}{R} + (\epsilon+t) \\ \gamma_3: [0, \pi]\to \mathbb C, \quad t\mapsto \epsilon e^{it} \\ \gamma_4:[0,\pi] \to \mathbb C, \quad t \mapsto Re^{it}$$
Now here's what I am unsure about. To show that the big and the small circle vanish as $R\to \infty$ and $\epsilon \to 0$ is not too hard, but how to deal with the other integrals?
Can I just say 
$$\int_{\gamma_1} f(z)dz = \int_0^R \frac{\log(-\frac{\epsilon}{R}t+\epsilon+t)}{(-\frac{\epsilon}{R}t + \epsilon + t)^2 + a^2}(\frac{\epsilon}{R}+1)dt \xrightarrow{\epsilon \to 0} \int_0^R \frac{\log t}{t^2 + a^2}dt$$ 
or what kind of reasoning should be used to interchange limit and integral?Also, I then finally I get $$\int_0^\infty \frac{\log(x)}{x^2+a^2}dx = \pi \frac{\log a + i\frac{\pi}{2}}{2a}$$

I'm currently reading a paper, where they assert that for a nonnegative sequence $a_k$ of real numbers with $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{k} < + \infty$, we have $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k = 1}^n a_k = 0$.

Connect the fifth point with the remaining available point ($A$) and draw a perpendicular line  ($\overline{EF}$) from it to the diagonal line. You now have $4$ distinct triangles tiling the square. Place a fifth point ($E$) anywhere on some side ($\overline{BC}$)  of the square except on the middle point ($P$) of that side. Connect it with the two points of the opposing side ($\overline{DA}$) and draw a perpendicular line ($\overline{DF}$ or $\overline{AF}$) from any of those two points to the opposing line segment.

Construct the perpendicular to $\overline{AE}$ through $E$ which intersects side $\overline{CD}$ at $F$. Finish the division by drawing $AF$. You now have $4$ distinct triangles tiling the square. Do these constructions contain all valid solutions to tile the
  unit square with $4$ distinct right angle triangles? Or are there some other ways missing? The goal is to find all valid solutions for this simple problem, and prove no more exist.

Follow up question; is it possible that there exists a solution among the solutions such that all four triangles have all side lengths rational?

$$u \wedge v = u \otimes v - v \otimes u$$
I'm trying to work out how to fit this together with the characterisation of the exterior algebra $\Lambda V$ as the quotient of the tensor algebra $T(V)$ by the two-sided ideal $I$ generated by tensor products of the form $v \otimes v$. In that characterisation (at least in Wikipedia), the wedge product is defined by
$$[u] \wedge [v] = [u \otimes v]$$
where square brackets indicate equivalence classes, for the equivalence relation $\sim$ induced by the ideal (i.e., $u \sim v$ iff $v = u + i$, for some $i \in I$). At first, I took it that the way they fit together was that we would be able to show that $$u \otimes v \sim u \otimes v - v \otimes u$$ But so far as I'm able to tell, this isn't the case: what we can show instead is that $u \otimes v \sim -v \otimes u$, and hence that
$$u \otimes v \sim \frac{1}{2} (u \otimes v - v \otimes u)$$
Having browsed a bit, this answer suggests to me that what's going on is just that there are two ways of relating the exterior algebra to the tensor algebra: the MTW characterisation amounts to treating $\Lambda V$ as a subalgebra of $T(V)$ (specifically, the subalgebra generated by antisymmetric tensor products), rather than as a quotient algebra of $T(V)$. Is that correct? If so, what are the advantages of a subalgebra vs a quotient algebra construction, and vice versa?

As shown on the image, the class 010 is missing. There can also be the case where all three points intersect at the same place and we only get 6 domains but this is of fewer interest for me. I've tried to understand what's going on in two dimensions and I figured out that you can get maximum $n+1$ new domains by adding a straight line, where $n$ designs the number of existing straight lines. It seems to work pretty fine, although I did not prove it (my bad): For all integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the maximum number of domains that you can get with $n$ straight lines on a plane. $$

I defined another function $f_D$ that describes the maximum number of domains you get when cutting a $D$-dimensional space with hyperplanes. From hand drawings, I got the following formula (which does not hold for $n=0$ anymore): $$
\text{Conjecture:}~~~~~~~~~~~\forall D\in \mathbb N^*, ~~ \begin{cases}

Are there any analogous visualization techniques for nested radicals--to visualize, for instance, equations of the form: $$\sqrt{n + \sqrt{n + \sqrt{n + ...}}} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4n}}{2},$$ such as studied by Ramanujan and others?

But can one represent it (and others like it) graphically/geometrically?

From length of Gaussian Random Vector we know that the general probability density function of $\sqrt{Q(\vec{X})} = \sqrt{X^TAX}$ does not follow any known laws. However I'm only looking for the variance. From the post we know that when analyzing the quadratic form (see linked post)
$$
Q(\vec{X})=\sum_{i=1}^k\lambda_i\left(U_i+b_i\right)^2=\sum_{i=1}^k\lambda_i\left(U_i^2 + 2b_iU_i + b_i^2\right)
$$
we obtain a superposition of Chi-Squared-Distributions and zero-mean Gaussian distributions since $\vec{U}$ is multivariate normal with identity covariance matrix and expectation zero.
Using these rules we obtain: $var\left(U_i^2\right) = 2$ (Chi-Squared) $var\left(U_i\right) = 1$ (uniform Gaussian) $var\left(2b_iU_i\right) = 4b_i^2$ $var\left(b_i^2\right) = 0$ (constant) $cov\left(U_i^2, 2b_iU_i\right) = E\left[2b_iU_i^3\right] = 2b_iE\left[U_i^3\right] = 0$ $cov\left(U_i^2, b_i^2\right) = 0$ $var\left(U_i^2 + 2b_iU_i + b_i^2\right) = 2 + 4b_i^2$, and hence $$var\left(Q(\vec{X})\right) = \sum_{i=1}^k\lambda_i^2(2 + 4b_i^2)$$ So the only step missing would to find $var\left(\sqrt{Q(\vec{X})}\right)$ given $var\left(Q(\vec{X})\right)$. Unfortunately it doesn't appear that simple according to Mean and variance of $\sqrt{X}$ given mean and variance of X . So how to move on with this?

Furthermore, following Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry exercise 4.9.b, for a fixed elliptic curve $E$, the set elliptic curves of isogenous to $E$ is countable.

For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$: Is it possible to find a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $n$ distinct $x$-intercepts, and all of its turning points, at lattice points? This is clearly true when $n = 1$ and $n = 2$. A bit of investigation around $n = 3$ leads to, e.g., the polynomial defined by: $$f(x) = x^3 + 33x^2 + 216x = x(x+9)(x+24)$$ which has $x$-intercepts at $(0,0)$, $(-9, 0)$, and $(-24, 0)$. Taking the derivative, we find that: $$f'(x) = 3x^2 + 66x + 216 = 3(x+4)(x+18)$$ so that the turning points of $f$ occur at $(-4, -400)$ and $(-18, 972)$.

Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold, and let $f : M \to M$ be a $\mathcal{C}^2$ Axiom A diffeomorphism. (For our purposes, this means there is a closed invariant $\Omega_s \subseteq M$ for which there is a $Df$-invariant splitting of the tangent bundle $T\Omega_s = E^s \oplus E^u$.) Bowen writes the following (first paragraph of Section 4B): For $x \in \Omega_s$, let $\phi^{(u)}(x) = -\log \lambda(x)$, where $\lambda(x)$ is the Jacobian of the linear map $$Df : E^u_x \to E^u_{fx}$$ using inner products derived from the Riemannian metric. My question is, how exactly is $\lambda(x)$ defined? My first thought was it's the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives, but (a) this requires writing $Df$ in coordinates and I'm not sure the determinant is coordinate-idnependent, and (b) this determinant has seemingly nothing to do with the Riemannian structure on $M$, but the dependence of $\phi^{(u)}(x)$ on the Riemannian metric plays a key role in subsequent arguments of his lecture notes.

2313301,Keeping the change in angle constant,"Say I have a ball under a plane that has been secured to the ground on the left, as shown in the diagram (the red part). When I push the ball to the left, the angle increases. If I wanted the change in angle to be constant, what velocity function would the ball have to follow? I know the change in angle change starts off as being large and then continues to diminish because of the sin curve. So, I'm thinking the velocity might just be the cos function. Is this right?",['trigonometry']
2313306,Is there some general way to characterize real symmetrical functions?,"I am looking for a way to rewrite a function $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ that is symmetric in its two arguments. That is:
$$
f(x,y) = f(y,x)
$$
At first I was thinking that since $x$ and $y$ are interchangeable, their influence on the value of $f$ must be the same, hence somewhere within $f$ they must be mapped by some auxiliary function $a$ and then aggregated somehow. For example by summation or multiplication:
$$
f(x,y) = a(x) + a(y) \\
 \text{  or}\\
f(x,y) = a(x)a(y)
$$
We can see that if we compose $f$ with any $g : \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$, the symmetry remains. Hence if we take the logarithm of the lower equation, we can transform multiplication into addition. This would suggest a general form:
$$
f(x,y) = g(a(x) + a(y))
$$
But the problem is that if we add two symmetric functions, we also get a symmetric function, but the given general form does not stand up to this task:
$$
f_1(x,y) + f_2(x,y) = g_1(a_1(x) + a_1(y)) + g_2(a_2(x) + a_2(y))
$$
Is there some general way to characterize $f$? We can assume any number of finite derivatives of $f$.","['functional-analysis', 'functions', 'symmetric-functions']"

2313448,What is the difference between orthogonal subspaces and orthogonal complements?,"I am learning linear algebra through professor Giblert Strang's lectures on MIT OCW. The professor says that the row space and the null space of a matrix are orthogonal subspaces . This I can follow, since any vector in the nullspace takes any linear combination of the rows to zero. He then says that the row space and null space are more than just orthogonal subspaces, they are orthogonal complements , Because The ""nullspace contains all the vectors that are perpendicular to the row space"" , and vice versa. Consider:
$$A= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix}=0 $$ A is rank 2, Dimension of nullspace of A=1 Null space:
$$X=c \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ Graphically, the row space of A is the x-y plane, and the null space is the z-axis. It's easy to see that the nullspace does not contain all the vectors that are perpendicular to a vector in the row space. If we look at $[1 ~0~ 0]$, it has the entire y-z plane perpendicular to it, not just the z-axis. All I can see is two orthogonal subspaces. I do not understand what additional property has earned these subspaces the term orthogonal complements .

2313458,Can a continuous function take finite and infinite values?,"Let $X$ be a convex subspace of $\mathbb R^n$. Can a function $f:X\mapsto \mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}$ be continuous when there are $x_1,x_2\in X$ such that $f(x_1)=\infty$ and  $f(x_2)<\infty$? My intuition is that that's not possible, here is my reasoning: We take a continuous path $(x_t)_{1\leq t\leq 2}$ from $x_1$ to $x_2$. Then there has to be an $x_s$ such that $f(x_s)=\infty$, but $f(x_{s+\epsilon})<\infty, \forall\epsilon>0$.

2313472,"given the inverse of a matrix, is there an efficient way to find the determinant?","Suppose one has the inverse $A^{-1}$ of an $N\times N$ non-singular matrix $A$ .   Is there an ''efficient'' way to obtain $\det{A}$ ? With ''efficient'' I mean anything that has a better scaling than the standard $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ .  Naively, one can argue that $\det{A}$ is already implicitly incorporated in the inverse via the adjugate $A^{-1}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{\det{A}}\operatorname{adj}A$ , so all the work has ""already been done"", and one only needs an efficient trick to distill the determinant. E.g.: for $N=2$ , we have $A=\left(\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c & d\end{array}\right)$ and $A^{-1}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{\det{A}}\left(\begin{array}{cc} d & -b \\ -c & a\end{array}\right)$ .

However, when $x=\frac{\pi}4$, $f_n$ converges to 1. So it seems that $f_n$ converges pointwise to $$f(x)=\begin{cases}
0\mbox{ if $0\leq x<\pi/4$,}\\
1\mbox{ if $x=\pi/4$.}

2313580,Is the product of two Zariski closed subgroups of $GL_n$ still Zariski closed?,"Let $H, H' \subset GL_n {k}$ be two Zariski closed subgroups. Is the set $H H' = \{ h h' : h \in H, h' \in H' \}$ Zariski closed? Here $k$ is a field. Same question for any (reductive?) algebraic group. The counter examples I know to this claim in topological groups setting (where Zariski closed is replaced by closed) are distinctly non-algebraic, since these involve infinite discrete subgroups, or similar. I guess a proof might be found by studying the action of $H$ and $H'$ on the ideals $I(H)$ and $I(H')$ through the regular representation. Maybe if $\rho_H$ is the (left) Reynolds operator for $H$, then $\rho_H(I(H'))$ should vanish on $HH'$, and similarly for a right reynolds operator for $H'$. Though for this we would need $H$ and $H'$ to be reductive to get these projectors, and I'm not sure how to argue further. These are the only ways I could think of right now to produce functions vanishing on $H H'$. I guess that if true this is a standard fact -- a reference or hint would be great.","['algebraic-groups', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Prove that there exists a prime q such that for every integer n, the number $n^p-p$ is not divisible by q. I studied one version of the solution which started with the expanded form of the equation, $${\frac{p^p-1}{p-1}}$$ Then, it is quite obvious that we would find atleast one prime divisor of ${\frac{p^p-1}{p-1}}$ which is not congruent to $1$ $mod$ $p^2$ . Denoting this prime divisor as $q$ . And in the  solution it stated that this $q$ is what we wanted. I don't understand why this is the q we  sought for in the first place. I also don't understand how this $q$ is related to the $q$ we wanted in forming the proof. Also, from the method of reasoning in the solution, it deduced by stating Fermat's Little Theorem that $n^{q-1}=1$ mod $q$ . I don't understand how $n$ is coprime to $q$ , because this version of FLT is true only for $(q,n)=1$ So, please help me clear my doubts and also if it wouldn't be too much of a trouble, please tellâ your versions of the solution.
