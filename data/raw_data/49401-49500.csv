503457,Compactness with Ascoli-Arzelà?,"Let 
  $$
K:= \{x: [0,T] \to \mathbb R: x^{\prime}(t)=x^2(t), \, 0\le x(T) \le 1\}.
$$
  Prove that $K$ is a compact subset of $C([0,T],\mathbb R)$. My idea is to use Ascoli-Arzelà thm. First of all, by some routine calculations I have found that 
$$
K= \left\{x:[0,T] \to \mathbb R: x(t)=\frac{x(T)}{x(T)(T-t)+1}, \, 0\le x(T) \le 1\right\}
$$ Then I have shown that $K$ is equibounded :
$$
\vert x(t)\vert\le\left\vert \frac{x(T)}{(T-t)x(T)+1}\right\vert \le x(T) \le 1
$$
for every $t \in[0,T]$ and for every $x(\cdot) \in K$. $K$ is equicontinuous : indeed the following holds true
$$
\vert x(t_1)-x(t_2) \vert \le \vert t_1 -t_2 \vert 
$$
for every $t_1,t_2 \in[0,T]$ and for every $x(\cdot) \in K$. Finally I have to show that $K$ is closed: let us take $x_n \to x$ uniformly s.t. $x^{\prime}_n = x_n^2$ for every $n$. Then $x_n^2 \to x^2$ uniformly; to sum up we have $x_n \to x$ uniformly; $x^{\prime}_n = x_n^2 \to x^2$ uniformly. Hence $x$ is differentiable and $x^{\prime}=x^2$. Is my proof correct?

I'm fairly sure an absolutely minimum requirement would be the existence of a curve $\Gamma\subset\mathbb C$ connecting $a$ and $b$ such that $f|_\Gamma$ is analytical, since then one can use analytical continuation along $\Gamma$ within the local convergence radius to iteratively ""crawl"" from $a$ to $b$. However, I'm neither sure whether the formula always remains valid even if there are singularities closer to $a$ or $b$ than these two points are separated, nor whether this criterion alone is sufficient. edit The bounty will be awarded to an answer at least more soundly proving the jump-case, though a working solution along a continuous curve would be even better.

$$
for all $(s,t)\in S\times T$? In particular, I was thinking of something of this sort: if $F$ is $0$ everywhere, $(\ast)$ works obviously with $f\equiv0$ and $g\equiv0$, so assume there exists $(s',t')\in S\times T$ such that $F(s',t')\neq0$. Up to rescaling $F$ we may assume $F(s',t')=1$. Let

503726,Generating seating plans- maximal number of orderings with different adjacencies,"Background: So the school I work at has a policy that we try and sit the kids next to as many different other kids as possible throughout the academic year. This means rejigging the seating plan as often as you can be bothered to. With a decentish understanding of VBA, I figured I'd write a macro to take care of this for me, but I've come up against a snag. The basic algorithm is to shuffle the list, then transcribe that to a seating plan in a predefined way. The hope is to shuffle the list in such a way that no two students are adjacent that were before. But my problem is there seems no simple way of characterising these shuffles. Maths So suppose we have an ordered list of n elements (possibly it will be easier to consider it as cyclic list, so that n is adjacent to 1), how can one reliably generate the maximum number of reorderings of that list in which no two reorderings share adjacent pairs? One obvious strategy might be a random walk on $S_n$, but without knowing the maximal number this could go on forever looking for a reordering that wasn't there. So a natural supplementary question is: what is the maximal number of such reorderings? Failing that, what is a reliable way of making (a possibly suboptimal number of) 'mixing' reorderings? So far I have experimented with Faro shuffles (which do not guarantee mixing under composition), groups of invertible elements in $\mathbb{Z}_n^\times$ (multiplicative group of integers modulo n- which seem quite meagre in only offering $ \phi(n)$/2 reorderings), and have toyed with some random-walk code, all to no avail.

503918,Ample Cartier divisors and coherent sheaves,"my question regards the definition of ample Cartier divisors. An invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ on a noetherian scheme $X$ is said to be ample if for every coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$, there exists an integer $n_{0}> 0$ such that for every integer $n\geq n_{0}$, the sheaf $\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n}$ is generated by its global sections. 
We say that a Cartier divisor $D$ is ample if the corresponding invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}(D)$ is ample. In my paper I only work with schemes that correspond to projective varieties over an algebraically closed field $k$. I would like to formulate the definitons of ample invertible sheaves and ample Cartier divisors without using coherent sheaves. Is that possible? If so, another question arises. Consider the following theorem due to Serre: Let X be a projective scheme over a notherian Ring $A$, let $\mathcal{O}_{X}(1)$ be a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$, and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-module. Then there is an integer $n_{0}$ such that for all $n\geq n_{0}$, the sheaf $\mathcal{F}(n):= \mathcal{F}\otimes \mathcal{O}_{X}(n)$ can be generated by a finite number of global sections. If $X$ is a scheme corresponding to a projective variety over an algebraically closed field $k$, can we rewrite Serre's theorem in a way that we'll be able to show that very ample sheaves are ample, but without using coherent sheaves?

Using trial and error I found out that if $a,b,c$ are solution of the equation, then they are in arithmetic progression. I've managed to prove that conjecture, assuming that $c>b>a$ and let $k$ be their common difference in the arithmetic progression. Then WLOG we have: $$b = c-k \quad \quad a = c-2k$$ Now the equation looks like: $$(c-2k)^3 + (c-k)^3 + c^3 = 6(c-2)(c-1)c$$ After expanding we have: $$c^3 - 6kc^2 + 12ck^2 - 8k^3 + c^3 - 3kc^2 + 3ck^2 -k^3 + c^3 = 6c^3 - 18kc^2 + 12ck^2$$
$$3c^3 - 9kc^2 + 15ck^2 - 9k^3 = 6c^3 - 18kc^2 + 12ck^2$$
$$c^3 - 3kc^2 + 5ck^2 - 3k^3 = 2c^3 - 6kc^2 + 4ck^2$$
$$-c^3 + 3kc^2 + ck^2 - 3k^3 = 0$$ Now it's easy to see that if $k=c$, then the LHS will be zero, so one of the zeroes of the polynomial is $c_1 = k$, now factorizing we have: $$(c-k)(3a^2 + 2ax - x^2) = 0$$
$$(c-k)(c+k)(c-3k) = 0$$ Now we have three distinct cases: Case 1: $c = k$ This implies that $b = 0$ and $a = -k$. But because $k \in \mathbb{N}$, both $a,b \not\in \mathbb{N}$, violating the initial conditions. Case 2: $c = -k$ Obviously the initial condition is already violated, becasue $k \in \mathbb{N}$, so from the relation $c \not\in \mathbb{N}$ Case 2: $c = 3k$ This implies that $b = 2k$ and $a = k$. Now we have one 3-tuple $(3k,2k,k)$ and it's permutation as solution, where $k \in \mathbb{N}$. But it's easy to note that $k$ is a common factor for $a,b,c$ so we have: $$gcd(a,b,c) = k$$ But because we want $gcd(a,b,c) = 1$, this implies that $k=1$, which means we have only one solution for  $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 6abc$ in  $\mathbb{N}$, such that $gcd(a,b,c) = 1$ and it $(1,2,3)$, solution that is already given. Now my question is what I'm missing. Is there really no other solutions such that $gcd(a,b,c) = 1$?

504339,Equivalence of integral and differential forms of transport equation,"I would like to prove the equivalence of the differential and integral forms of Reynold's transport equation. This problem is stated in terms of fluid mechanics. Problem Statement Let $V$ be a closed volume in $\mathbb{R}^3$,  $A$ be the surface of $V$,  and $\mathbf{n}$ the normal to A ($\mathbf{n}$ is thus a function of position). Let $F(\mathbf{x}, t)$ be a scalar function of three-dimensional position and time. Also let $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ be the
field velocity in $\mathbb{R}^3$. By letting $V \to 0$, derive this equality: $$
\frac{DF}{Dt}= \frac{\partial F}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial x_i} u_i
$$ from this one:
$$
\frac{D}{Dt} \int_V F \ dV= \int_V \frac{\partial F}{\partial t}\ dV + \int_A  (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n})\ F \ dA,
$$
where $D/Dt$ denotes a full derivative and double indices denote summation. Attempt at a Solution We first convert the integral over $A$ to one over $V$ by way of the divergence theorem: $$
\int_A  (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n})\ F \ dA = \int_A (F \mathbf{u}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \ dA
 = \int_V \nabla \cdot (F\mathbf{u}) \ dV.
$$
Expand the divergence: 
$$
\int_V \nabla \cdot (F\mathbf{u}) \ dV =  \int_V \nabla F \cdot \mathbf{u} \ dV + \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u})F \ dV.
$$
Call this result (1). Although I do not understand why it is true, the text frequently uses equalities of the
form
$$

Do I plug $e^x$ back in for u and cancel out like terms? If I do that, won't I have to worry about the bottom of the fraction possibly being 0? Edit: Reworking without dropping the du. Let $u = e^x$ and $du = e^x dx$ Giving me $$ \int \frac{du}{(u-1)(u+2)} $$ So, if I split these, I have $$ \int \frac{du}{3(u-1)} + \int \frac{2du}{3(u+2)} $$ This gives me $$ \int \frac{1}{3(u-1)} + \int \frac{2}{3(u+2)} $$ So for the first part, I'll let $w = u - 1$ and bring the $\frac{1}{3}$ out front $$ \frac{1}{3} \int \frac{dw}{w} $$ This gives me $$ \frac{1}{3} ln | w | $$ which ultimately gives me $$ \frac{1}{3} ln | e^x - 1 | $$ Do the same for the other side, let $w = u + 2$ and bring the fraction out front $$ \frac{2}{3} \int \frac{dw}{w} $$ which gives me $$ \frac{2}{3} ln | e^x + 2 | $$ put them together and my final answer is $$ \frac{1}{3} ln | e^x - 1 | - \frac{1}{3} ln | e^x + 2 | + c $$ Does that seem correct? - Revised & correct now :)","['calculus', 'integration']"

504420,Contour integration for functions with residues that form an infinite oscillating sequence,"I would like to evaluate some complicated integrals involving the hyperbolic secant, but the extension of the usual contour integration evaluation using the residue theorem isn't clear to me. I've been considering a simple example with a known solution $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \text{Sech}\Big(\frac{\pi s}{2}\Big) \ d s \ = \ 2$$ This question is related as it discusses functions with an infinite number of poles, but there it is assumed that the sum of the residues converges. As is explained in that question, we are only ever actually considering bounded contours and then taking the limit that they grow arbitrarily large but I am not sure how that justifies my approach in this problem. Suppose I am quite cavalier and I attempt to evaluate this integral by closing the contour along a semi-circle in the upper-half complex plane. Without really checking, I claim that the integral along the circular part of the contour vanishes and thus the integral over the real line is given by $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2 \pi i \ \text{Res}\Big( \text{Sech}\Big(i\pi\big (n+\frac{1}{2}\big)\Big) = 4-4+4-4 \ . . .$$ which clearly does not converge. However, if we consider the average of the first $m$ partial sums $$\frac{1}{m}(4+0+4+0+ \ . . . ) = \left \{ \begin{array}{lr} 2 & \  m \in  \text{evens}\\ 2 + \frac{4}{m}& m \in \text{odds} \end{array} \right.$$ which goes to $2$ as $m \to \infty$. This procedure seems totally ad hoc, even magical, but it predicts the correct answer. The first question is, why does the limit of the average of the partial sums give the correct answer? Another way of regularizing this problem is to instead compute $$\lim_{\eta \to 0}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \text{Sech}\Big(\frac{\pi s}{2}\Big) e^{i  \eta \ s} \ d s $$ and then using the same procedure $$\lim_{\eta \to 0}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2 \pi i \ \text{Res}\Big( \text{Sech}\Big(i\pi\big (n+\frac{1}{2}\big) e^{-\eta (2n-1)}\Big) =\lim_{\eta \to 0} \frac{4e^{\eta}}{1+e^{2\eta}} = 2$$ also gives the correct answer. So, there seems to be something to this method. If I am more careful about the circular piece of the contour, I can show that its contribution is exponentially small almost everywhere. $\text{Sech}(x + iy)$ clearly decreases exponentially when $x$ is large, but what about when $y$ is large and $x$ is small? By rewriting $x + iy = re^{i \theta}$ and taking the absolute value, I can show that when $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} +\epsilon, \ \left|\epsilon\right|<1$ (ie we are close to the imaginary axis), then $$\left| \text{Sech}(re^{i\theta})\right|\sim e^{-\frac{1}{2}\pi r \left|\epsilon\right| } : \ \ r\to \infty$$ My understanding of the Riemann integral suggests that the single point where $\epsilon = 0$ does not change the value of the integral along the contour. So, it seems like I do have good reason to argue that the contribution from the circular contour vanishes. Is there a way, then, to justify my regularized sum of the residues as the correct answer in general or is it just an accident for this special case?","['regularization', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

Let $f$,$g$ be two functions on this set. We define a normalized cross correlation function as

Modification (as it doesnt sound interesting in this current form) I hope its ok in this special case. First we define an equivalence class and then modify the metric (infact would like to call it a similarity rather than metric and disacuss its properties and ask whether it would be modified to a metric if necessary) Equivalence class : Let $f$ be a function and we define its equivalence class as $\{kf_{\theta}\}$, $\require{enclose}

Imagine my surprise when we graphed the original function in the title and the domain was only [5, inf) ! I then thought about it a bit and realized it's because even though you're multiplying a function by 1, that doesn't mean the domain should stay the same (a simple case is y = x when multiplied by x/x becomes y = (x^2)/x, which has a hole at x = 0).

Evans PDE book uses the following result $$\frac{f(x+te_i)-f(x)}{t}\to\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x)\text{ uniformly as }h\to 0\;\;\;[\#]$$ The definition of uniformly convergence that I know uses sequences, but in this case no sequence is mentioned (and the book doesn't presents a definition). I think it's means that for each $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ (which depends on $\varepsilon$ and doesn't depend on $x$) such that $$x,x+te_i\in U, \; 0<|t|<\delta \Rightarrow \left|\frac{f(x+te_i)-f(x)}{t}-\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x)\right|<\varepsilon$$ My first question is: is the above definition correct? My second question is: is it enough $f\in C^1_c(U)$ to conclude $[\#]$? I think so, but some posts suggests that $f\in C^2_c(U)$ it's necessary (see here , here and here ). Then: My third question is: is the proof below correct? Proof of $[\#]$ (based on this post ): Suppose $f\in C^1_c(U)$. Let $g:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ be an extension of $f$ defined by $$g(x)=\left\{\begin{matrix}
f(x), &\text{if } x\in U\\ 
0, & \text{if }x\in\mathbb{R}^n\backslash U
\end{matrix}\right.\;\;\;(1)$$ So, $g\in C^1_c(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Consequently $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}\in C^1_c(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Therefore $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}$ is uniformly continuous. Follows that given $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ (which depends on $\varepsilon$ and doesn't depend on $x$) such that $$y,x\in\mathbb{R}^n,\;\|y-x\|<\delta\Rightarrow \left|\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}(y)-\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}(x)\right|<\varepsilon\;\;\;(2)$$ By Mean Value Theorem, given $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and $t\in\mathbb{R}$, there exists $\theta_{x,t}\in (0,1)$ such that $$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}(x+\theta_{x,t}te_i)=\frac{g(x+te_i)-g(x)}{t}\;\;\;(3)$$ Thus we can conclude that $$\begin{align*}
  x\in\mathbb{R}^n,\;0<|t|<\delta &\Rightarrow\|(x+\theta_{x,t}te_i)-x\|<|t|<\delta\\
           &\overset{(2)}\Rightarrow \left|\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}(x+\theta_{x,t}te_i)-\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}(x)\right|<\varepsilon\\

$$f_!(y)\cdot \hat{\mathfrak{A}}(X) = f_*(y \cdot e^{c_1/2} \cdot \hat{\mathfrak{A}}(Y)).$$
Why does not the choice of $c_1$ affect the identity? According to Remark following the theorem in the paper, if $X$ and $Y$ are complex manifolds and $f$ is holomorphic, then we can delete $e^{c_1/2}$ from the formula. Why can we delete it?","['characteristic-classes', 'complex-manifolds', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'topological-k-theory']"

504631,Mathematical model building with dependent and independent variables,"I have been working with data and building models on data. I have developed models in regression using cubic and power series. It works fine for variables with one dependent and one independent variable. What kind of technique is to be adopted if I have to find an equation or model for say, D depends on C, C changes for a set of B, which changes for different A. I can carry our bi-variate correlation to find significance. But, that is not something I am interested in. I have data, but wondering as to how to fit a model in those lines. I have tried building models with regression, line fitting and get a relationship between D and C, or D and B. Good fits with varying constants, but no relationship between the others. Is there a way to combine and build a model altogether? What is that kind of analysis called? How to go about it? Any software that would help me do it? I have been using SPSS, Minitab, and R.","['statistics', 'regression', 'data-analysis', 'mathematical-modeling']"
504675,Is $x = y \mod 7$ for a set of integers an equivalence relation?,"Equivalence relation is the relation which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. I have read somewhere that modulo operator defines an equivalence relation. But for this relationship I cant find $(7,7)$. If $y=7$ then $x=0$ (because $7$ is completely divisible by itself). Then how can it be reflexive? and how can it be an equivalence relation?","['equivalence-relations', 'discrete-mathematics']"
504693,Probability of consecutive row of at least $m$ by $n\leq2m$ events. Is there a shorter route?,"Inspired by this I started to generalize it. Go out from independent
events $E_{1},E_{2},\cdots$ that succeed or fail. This with $p$ as probability of succes, and $p+q=1$ . Event $A_{m,n}$ occurs if
among the first $n$ events there is a consecutive row of at least $m$ successes. Letting $K$ denote the smallest index of a failing
event, we have $P\left(K=k\right)=p^{k-1}q$ . Looking at $P\left(A_{m,n}\mid K=k\right)$ it is easy to find that this probability equals $1$ if $k>m$ and
equals $P\left(A_{m,n-k}\right)$ otherwise.  So for $m\leq n$ we find: $P\left(A_{m,n}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P\left(A_{m,n}\mid K=k\right)P\left(K=k\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{m}P\left(A_{m,n-k}\right)p^{k-1}q+p^{m}$ . Here $P\left(A_{m,n-k}\right):=0$ if $m>n-k$ . I thought that this would lead to some unfriendly polynomial in $p$ ,
but working this out for $n=m,m+1,m+2,m+3,...,2m$ a pattern showed up,
and with induction I could prove: $P\left(A_{m,n}\right)=p^{m}\left(1+\left(n-m\right)q\right)$ if $m\leq n\leq 2m$ The fact that this is a neat formula pleases me, but also bothers me. Quite often
it indicates that there is a shorter route. Do you know one?","['dice', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"
