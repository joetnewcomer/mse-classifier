425544,Find the domain and inverse of function $y^2-1+\log_2(x-1)=0$,"Problem : Find the domain and inverse of a function y of x :  $y^2-1+\log_2(x-1)=0$ My approach : 
$$
y^2-1+\log_2(x-1)=0 \implies y =\sqrt{\log_2\left(\frac{2}{x-1}\right)}
$$
therefore, the domain of the function can be determined as: the square root part should be $>0\implies \log_2\left(\frac{2}{x-1}\right) >0  \implies x <3$ Also $x \neq 1$ and also $\frac{2}{x-1} >0 \implies x >1$ This implies, the domain of the function is $(1,3)$. Is it correct, please suggest and also suggest how to get the inverse of this function, thanks.","['calculus', 'functions']"
425546,Boundedness and total boundedness,"We say that a metric space $M$ is totally bounded if for every $\epsilon>0$ , there exist $x_1,\ldots,x_n\in M$ such that $M=B_\epsilon(x_1)\cup\ldots\cup B_\epsilon(x_n)$ . Prove that if $M$ is a totally bounded metric space, then $M$ is bounded. Given an example to show that the converse is false. The ""prove"" part is routine. Given points $a,b$ , suppose $a$ is in the ball of $x_i$ and $y$ is in the ball of $x_j$ . Then $d(a,b)\le d(a,x_i)+d(x_i,x_j)+d(x_j,b)<\epsilon+d(x_i,x_j)+\epsilon$ . Since there are only finitely many values of $d(x_i,x_j)$ , we are done. For the ""example"" part, the space must be bounded, but somehow there exists $\epsilon$ such that the space cannot be covered with finitely many balls of radius $\epsilon$ . I can't think of what that space should look like... things like $[a,b]$ , open ball, etc. are totally bounded.","['metric-spaces', 'real-analysis']"

425550,"Is every point in $(0,1)$ part of an open set? A rather elementary approach.","On the interval $(0,1)$ on $\Bbb{R}$, we know that if we select any point $p$ on it, we can find an open interval $(a,b)$ containing it, where $a,b\in (0,1)$. We say this is true for every point $\in (0,1)$. However, the presence of this open interval is contingent on the fact that there are numbers greater than and lesser than $P$, which are the upper and lower bounds for the interval containing $p$. Say we have a sequence $\langle x_{n}\rangle$ converging to $1$ in $(0,1)$. We know that any $x_{i}$ we select will lie in an open interval. However, can we say the same for EVERY $x_{i}$? I think there is a difference between saying something is true for 
ANY point we may choose in an infinite sequence, and that property being true for EVERY point in that sequence. I know we can't say there is a point $t\in (0,1)$ such that it is not contained in an open interval $\subset (0,1)$. But I find it difficult to digest that every point can be contained in an open set. EDIT: I will attempt to make the purpose of the question clearer. I know that for any such point $p$, we can construct a point in $(p,1)$. However, can the same be said for EVERY point in $(0,1)$? Also, forgive me for my ambiguous wording; I'm NOT trying to say that there exists one particular open set $(a,b)$ such that every $x_{i}$ is contained within it.

425583,"References about $PGL(2,q^2)/PGL(2,q)$","My question about $PGL(2,q^2)$ has 2 related parts: 1) I am interested in learning about the structure of the group $G:=PGL(2,q^2)$, where $q$ is a prime power. Particularly in the cosets of $PGL(2,q)$ in $PGL(2,q^2)$. I would like it if you could recommend some introductory references to start learning about this group and these cosets. 2) I would like to be able to enumerate all $\Theta(q^3)$ distinct elements in the coset $PGL(2,q)$ in $PGL(2,q^2)$, without repetition. I have seen that there are $\Theta(q^3)$ distinct representatives (1 for each coset). My problem is that so far I haven't been able to enumerate them without repetition, so I end up doing more work by enumerating $\Theta(q^4)$ elements instead. So far my enumeration strategy goes like this: -Given an element $m_1:=\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d\end{pmatrix} \in G$, with $a,d \neq 0$,
I can perform elementary row operations and transform it into the element:
$m_2:=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \bar{b} \\ \bar{c} & 1\end{pmatrix} \in G$, such that $m_1$ and $m_2$ are equivalent in G. -Under the assumption that $a,d\neq 0$ I try every possible $\bar{b},\bar{c} \in F_{q^2}$, so I list $\Theta(q^4)$ elements. Then I handle the cases where $a$ or $d$ are $0$. I have tried other row operations, but still can't enumerate the elements of $G$ without repetitions.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-groups']"
425590,Is there a noncompact operator from $\ell^\infty$ to a reflexive space?,"It is well known that bounded operators from $c_{0}$ to a reflexive Banach space $X$ are in fact all compact. Indeed, since it can be shown that an operator is compact iff for any weakly convergent sequence in its domain, its image is convergent, one may consider the adjoint, which is an operator from $X$ to $\ell_{1}$, and use the Schur theorem (it is also known that an operator is compact iff its adjoint is) I wonder if it can be done ""the other way round"": if I take an operator which is adjoint to an adjoint to one from $c_{0}$ to $X$, it is an operator from $\ell^{\infty}$ to $X$, and is compact. Hovere these aren't (are they?) all bounded operators. I would be very grateful if someone provides an example of a noncompact operator from $\ell^{\infty}$ to an reflexive space. If such operators exists, what about ones to $\ell_{p}$, for $p\in [1,\infty)$, maybe at least they have to be compact?

425775,A remark on triangulated categories and localizations in Kashiwara & Schapira's *Sheaves on Manifolds*,"I'm having a little difficulty understanding the following remark in Kashiwara & Schapira's Sheaves on Manifolds : Since the term ""null system"" doesn't appear to be very common, here is the definition, along with its main application: The notation $\mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N}$ in the remark stands for the localization of $\mathcal{C}$ at $S(\mathcal{N}).$ The functor $Q$ is the canonical functor sending a morphism $f:X \rightarrow Y$ to the roof $X \xleftarrow{1} X \xrightarrow{f} Y.$ Now, I'm fine with one direction. Namely, it's clear enough that if there exists $Y$ such that $X \oplus Y \in \mathcal{N},$ then $Q(X) \cong 0,$ for the triangulated category and null system axioms show that $X \oplus Y$ being in $\mathcal{N}$ is equivalent to the zero morphism $X \oplus Y \rightarrow 0$ being in $S(\mathcal{N}).$ Hence $0 \leftarrow X \oplus Y \rightarrow X$ is a roof in $\mathcal{C}/\mathcal{N},$ so that the diagram shows that $X$ is isomorphic to $0$ in the localization (here $i,$ resp. $p,$ is the canonical inclusion, resp. projection). The other direction is still unclear to me. We have a diagram of roofs , where $Z \in \mathcal{N}$ and $f \circ g = 1.$ I have tried to show that $Z \cong X \oplus X[1],$ but I don't even think it is true.

425782,Why does Monte-Carlo integration work better than naive numerical integration in high dimensions?,"Can anyone explain simply why Monte-Carlo works better than naive Riemann integration in high dimensions? I do not understand how chosing randomly the points on which you evaluate the function can yield a more precise result than distributing these points evenly on the domain. More precisely: Let $f:[0,1]^d \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous bounded integrable function, with $d\geq3$. I want to compute $A=\int_{[0,1]^d} f(x)dx$ using $n$ points. Compare 2 simple methods. The first method is the Riemann approach. Let $x_1, \dots, x_n$ be $n$ regularly spaced points in $[0,1]^d$ and $A_r=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)$. I have that $A_r \to A$ as $n\to\infty$. The error will be of order $O(\frac{1}{n^{1/d}})$. The second method is the Monte-Carlo approach. Let $u_1, \dots, u_n$ be $n$ points chosen randomly but uniformly over $[0,1]^d$. Let $A_{mc}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f(u_i)$. The central limit theorem tells me that $A_{mc} \to A$ as $n\to \infty$ and that $A_{mc}-A$ will be in the limit a gaussian random variable centered on $0$ with variance $O(\frac{1}{n})$. So with a high probability the error will be smaller than $\frac{C}{\sqrt{n}}$ where $C$ does not depend (much?) on $d$. An obvious problem with the Riemann approach is that if I want to increase the number of points while keeping a regular grid I have to go from $n=k^d$ to $n=(k+1)^d$ which adds a lots of points. I do not have this problem with Monte-Carlo. But if the number of points is fixed at $n$, does Monte-Carlo really yield better results than Riemann? It seems true in most cases. But I do not understand how chosing the points randomly can be better. Does anybody have an intuitive explanation for this?","['monte-carlo', 'integration', 'numerical-methods']"

425818,"total differential of $f+g$, $fg$ and $\frac fg$","Let $f,g:\mathbb R^n\rightarrow\mathbb R$ be differentiable. We had in lectures that $f+g,fg,\frac fg$ are differentiable too. As an exercise I want to prove this. $f$ is differentiable in $x\in\mathbb R^n$ $\Leftrightarrow$ there is  a lineare function $A$ such that $\lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)-A(h)}{\|h\|}=0$ So for $fg$ I get\begin{align*}
&\lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{(fg)(x+h)-(fg)(x)-A(h)}{\|h\|}\\&
=\lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{f(x+h)g(x+h)-f(x)g(x)-A(h)}{\|h\|}
\end{align*}Now I am really stuck. How can you show with above that $fg$ is totally differentiable in $x$? Solution: \begin{align}
&\lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{f(x+h)g(x+h)-f(x)g(x)-(gDf+fDg)(x)h}{\|h\|}\\
&=\lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{f(x+h)g(x+h)-f(x+h)g(x)-f(x+h)Dg(x)h}{\|h\|}\\&+\frac{f(x+h)g(x)-f(x)g(x)-g(x)Df(x)h+f(x+h)Dg(x)h}{\|h\|}\\&-\frac{f(x)Dg(x)h}{\|h\|}\\
&=\lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{f(x+h)(g(x+h)-g(x)-Dg(x)h)}{\|h\|}+g(x)\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)-Df(x)h}{\|h\|}+\frac{(f(x+h)-f(x))Dg(x)h}{\|h\|}
\end{align} So the first term is $fDg$ since $f$ is continuous and differentiable. The second term is $gDf$ and the last one is 0 since $f$ is continuous and $Dg$ linear and so bounded. So the limit equals 0 and $fg$ is differentiable with derivative $gDf+fDg$.","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

425948,A few standard results (on metrizability and relative separation strength) without choice?,"I've been going back over some results from Munkres's Topology , and I'm curious about some things.... I know that Choice principles have some connection to the separation axioms (in ZF, at least)--for example: Locally compact Hausdorff spaces are Baire if and only if the Axiom of Dependent Multiple Choices holds. [Due to Fossy and Morillon, I believe.] Complete pseudometric spaces are Baire if and only if the Axiom of Dependent Choices holds. Still, it seems likely that compactness (or the weaker condition of completeness) and ""Baireness"" may be playing a substantial part, here. The link provided below by dfeuer shows that the Urysohn Metrization Theorem--which states that regular, Hausdorff, second-countable spaces are metrizable (or equivalently, that a space is separable and metrizable if and only if it is regular, Hausdorff, and second countable)--holds in ZF, though the Urysohn Lemma--which states that a space is normal Hausdorff if and only if any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by a continuous function--does not. That's a nice result. I have two questions, then. First, I wonder if it is known how little Choice is needed for the Urysohn Lemma to hold--the usual proof (cf. Munkres) uses Dependent Choice, and Andreas has suggested that Dependent Multiple Choices may do the trick. Is it known if we can do with even less Choice than that? Is it possible that the Urysohn Lemma is equivalent (in ZF) to some other known Choice principle? Second, I wonder what is known about how much Choice is needed to prove the following metrization theorems, or whether any of them are known to be equivalent in ZF: Nagata-Smirnov Metrization Theorem : A topological space $X$ is metrizable if and only if it is $T_3$ and has a basis that is countably locally finite [= $\sigma$ -locally finite base].

Lax has just established that if $\lambda$ is a simple root of $\chi_A(x)$, then one of the principal minors of $A-\lambda I$ has nonzero determinant. Then he continues (p. 131): ""Let A be (a matrix with $a$ as a simple root of its characteristic polynomial) and take the eigenvalue $a$ to be zero. Then one of the principal $(n-1)\times (n-1)$ minors of $A$, say the $i$th, has nonzero determinant. We claim that the $i$th component of an eigenvector $h$ of $A$ pertaining to the eigenvalue $a$ is nonzero. Suppose it were denote (sic) by $h^{(i)}$ the vector obtained from $h$ by omitting the $i$th component, and by $A_ji$ (sic) the $i$th principal minor of $A$. Then $h^{(i)}$ satisfies $$A_{ii}h^{(i)}=0.""$$ Huh? Why should $A_{ii}h^{(i)}=0$? If I am to understand by $A_{ii}$ the $i$th principal minor of $A$, which results from omitting the $i$th row and $i$th column, then this statement seems false. For a dumb counterexample, let $A=\left[\begin{matrix}1&-1 \\ 2&-2\end{matrix}\right]$ and $h=\left[\begin{matrix}1\\1\end{matrix}\right]$. Then $A_{ii}h^{(i)}\neq 0$.

My best idea so far has been to try to apply Arzela-Ascoli, but again if I get too many sets intersecting at once I have trouble bounding the derivative. Do you have any suggestions? Edit: I have reduced the problem further to specifically showing that $f$ is continuous at $0$, by saying that if it is continuous at 0 then you may apply the same argument with $E$ replaced by $E_t$ to show that the original $f$ is continuous at $t$. I still have some problems with having countably many intervals, however. For example, consider $E=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty (n,n+1/n^p)$ for $p>1$.
