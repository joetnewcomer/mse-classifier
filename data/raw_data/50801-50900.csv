523358,parametrization and orientation of the Möbius band,"I know that the Möbius band is a nonorientable surface. However, the following exercise seems to contradict this. A Möbius band can be constructed as a ruled surface by $x(u,v)=\beta(u)+v\gamma(u)$, where $-1/3<v<1/3$ $\beta(u)=(\cos u, \sin u, 0)$ and $\gamma(u)=(\cos [u/2]\cos u, \cos [u/2]\sin u,\sin[u/2])$. Then the mapping $x$ from an  open set of $\mathbf{R}^2$ to the band is regular and one to one.
Its unit normal vector field can be got by the cross porduct of partial deravatives of $x$. This seems to contradict nonorientability of the Möbius band, because it has a unit normal vector field. Where am I mistaken?",['differential-geometry']

523420,A valuation-like function $w: \mathbb{N}^{+} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is a $p$-adic valuation?,"This question is a variant of problem 4, pg. 21, from Birkhoff and Maclane, A Survey of Modern Algebra . Given a function $w: \mathbb{N}^+ \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$  that behaves like a valuation function, i.e., (1) $ w(ab) = w(a) + w(b) $ (2) $ w(a+b) \geq \min(w(a), w(b)).$ Show that it is either constant $0$ function, $w(a) = 0$
  or a multiple of a $p$-adic valuation, in other words $\forall a \in \mathbb{N}^+, w(a) = k v_p(a)$ for some $p, k$ with $v_p(p^\alpha d) = \alpha $ when $(p, d) = 1 $. Note that this problem is relatively simple if $w$ is defined over $\mathbb{Z}\backslash \{0\}$ instead of $\mathbb{N}^+$ which is the problem listed in the book. My question is whether the stronger statement above is also true. My current proof attempt is incomplete. If $\forall a,\ w(a) = 0$ we are done. Otherwise let $n$ be the least number s.t. $w(n) \neq 0$. Easy to show from (1) that $n \neq 1$ since $w(1) = 0$ and that $n$ is prime. By unique factorisation theorem and (1) to get the result I need only prove that for all primes $p$, $p\neq n \implies w(p) = 0$. I tried to proceed using well founded induction. If $p \lt n$ done. Otherwise $p \gt n$. If $n \gt 2$ then $n, p$ are odd and $n+p$ is even hence $n+p=2q$. Now $n \nmid p$ so $n \nmid n + p$. If $n \gt 2$ we have $n \nmid q$. Since $q \lt p$ the induction hypothesis gives us $w(q) = 0$ and since $n \gt 2$, $w(2) = 0$. Thus $w(n+p) = w(2q) = w(2) + w(q) = 0 \ge \min(w(n), w(p))$. This gives us that $w(p) = 0$. I can't see how to solve the $n=2$ case. Is the case where $n=2$ solvable or is there a counterexample? Some perhaps useful facts. If $w(2) \neq 0$ and any other $w(p')=0$ for $p'$ prime, $p'\neq 2$ then $w(p) =0$ for all primes $p\neq2$. Easy to prove since every prime $p$ is an even multiple less than some power $r$ of $p'$ and by (1) $w(p^r) = 0$ and then by (2) $w(p) = 0$. It can't be the case that $w$ behaves identically on all primes, i.e. $w(p) = k$ for all primes $p$ since it is easy to compute counterexamples, e.g. $2^2*5^2 + 3^5 = 7^3$ that will contradict (2). Thus it must be distinct at some two primes $p_1, p_2$. This gives two distinct relatively prime numbers where w is equal, $ p_1^{w(p_2)} $ and $p_2^{w(p_1)}$. I hoped that this would lead to a contradiction but haven't found a way forward yet.","['p-adic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'monoid', 'valuation-theory']"

When it comes to $(-\infty, a), (-\infty, a], (b, +\infty), [b, +\infty)$ for $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, would it be enough to say that $(-\infty, a) = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}(-n, a)$ and etc?

523503,Approximation in Sobolev Spaces,"Consider the following proof in Lawrence Evans book 'Partial Differential Equations': How does it follows that $v^{\epsilon} \in C^{\infty}(\bar{V})$? I could see how $v^{\epsilon} \in C^{\infty}(V)$ by using the translations, but I'm having difficulty seeing how it extends to $\bar{V}$, since it says that $u_{\epsilon}(x) := u(x^{\epsilon}) \text{ for } x \text{ in } V$, we are mollifying on $V$. Do you have any idea of how this follows? Thanks for any assistance. How do we show that the convergent sequence $(v_m)_m$ which is stated in the Theorem statement converges uniformly to $u$?(Its actually called $(u_{m})_{m}$ in the proof stament but I will use $(v_{m})_{m}$). We use the fact that the convergence is uniform in a proof of a Theorem later in the book, so it is established as being uniformly convergent. The idea that I am proposing:
In the proof we have that $v := \sum_{i=0}^{N}\zeta_{i}v_{i}$ is a member of $(v_{m})_{m}$. 
I think the idea is that we form a sequence 
$(v_m)_m$ by letting say $\epsilon = (\frac{1}{m})$ and then by choosing a small enough $\epsilon$ such that we have the same $\epsilon$ for all the translations on each $V_{i}$ for $i=1,...N$ and $V_{0}$ and therefore we have $v_{m} := \sum_{i=0}^{N}\zeta_{i}v_{i}$ which allows us to write $||D^{\alpha}v_{m} - D^{\alpha}u||_{L^{P}(U)} \leq CN\delta$ for small enough $\epsilon$ and all $\epsilon$ smaller, so for some $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and for all $m \geq N$ we have $||v_{m} - u||_{L^{P}(U)} \leq CN\delta$. From this we have the uniform convergence from the usual definition. Does this make sense? Is it necessary to do this or is the uniform continuity more apparent?

523519,(Graded) deformations of algebras,"I'm reading the article of Braverman and Gaitsgory, Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for quadratic algebras of Koszul type , but I'm stuck in a point near the beginning. Let $A$ be a (positively) graded associative algebra over a field $k$. They define the groupoid of i-th level graded deformation of $A$ to be the category $\mathcal E_i(A)$, whose objects are graded $k[t]/(t^{i+1})$-algebras $B$, free over $k[t]/(t^{i+1})$ with an isomorphism $B / t B \simeq A$ and whose morphisms are isomorphisms of such objects. This is the classical definition of deformation (of whatever algebro-geometric object) and I have no doubt about it. Moreover, it is clear that reduction modulo $t^i$ defines a functor $\mathcal F_i \colon \mathcal E_{i+1}(A) \to \mathcal E_i(A)$. Now, they define $\mathcal E(A)$ to be the groupoid of graded algebras $B$ over $k[t]$ (yes, the polynomial ring), free over $k[t]$, together with an isomorphism $B / t B \simeq A$, and they claim the following: Lemma. Reductions modulo $t^i$ define an equivalence between the category $\mathcal E(A)$ and the inverse limit of the categories $\mathcal E_i(A)$ with respect to the functors $\mathcal F_i$. This looks false to me: I should be able to prove the statement if we replace the groupoid $\mathcal E(A)$ with the groupoid of deformations over the formal power series ring $k[[t]]$, but I don't see how to pass from a deformation over $\mathrm{Spec}(k[[t]])$ to a deformation over the affine line $\mathrm{Spec}(k[t])$. Remark 1. They use this property in what follows, because the strategy of the proof is precisely to construct a suitable deformation and then taking its fiber over $1$. However, as far as I understand, what they really do is to show that koszulity and certain conditions imply that the algebra $A$ we are interested in is unobstructed, so that we can construct a deformation over $\mathrm{Spec}(k[[t]])$. Remark 2. They say that this machinery can be essentially found in the classical work of Gerstenhaber, On the deformation of rings and algebras . I gave it a look, but it doesn't seem to consider deformations which are not infinitesimal, i.e. deformations over the affine line (just over formal power series rings). However, I could be wrong here, for I haven't read the whole article of Gerstenhaber.","['algebraic-geometry', 'deformation-theory']"

523560,Covariance matrix always positive semidefinite?,"I actually was perusing here right now to see if anything could explain a result I have been getting - of a covariance matrix which has a negative eigenvalue, yet the correlation matrix does not - but got a big surprise when I see all these statements that covariance matrices are always positive semidefinite. I have certainly not been getting this result. I get LOTS of negative eigenvalues when using the covariance matrix of things that are pairwise at least rather correlated. For instance, the correlation between various exponentially weighted averages of random walks with different time constants. I only need to get into the 30s of them with time constants increasing in a geometric sequence with a factor of 1.04 (in other words, 1, 1.04, 1.04^2) and BAM. Negative eigenvalues. Very SMALL negative eigenvalues, like 10^-6, but negative. And it's not matlab calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors wrong either, I try premultiplying and postmultiplying the matrix with an eigenvector for a negative eigenvalue and the result is a negative number. And don't even get me started on covariance matrices derived from actual observations rather than abstract functions, so that the ""observed"" covariance and correlation, which is the covariance divided by the square root of the corresponding variances of the 2 variables it's a covariance between, is not the underlying covariance or correlation of the actual random variable. In other words, say you have a particle moving around, and it has some mean square change in its position after a given amount of time. When the value which is observed over a period of time is used as the actual value - for instance, the mean square amount it moved in a millisecond, averaged over a period of a second - then just by luck it may not be the real mean square change in position after a millisecond, maybe it moved a little more or less than usual over that second. Negative eigenvalues are just frigging everywhere. So what is the deal then? Is it all numerical subtraction error? If I did it all with enough precision, would matlab find it to be positive definite always, when there is nothing linearly dependent (eigenvalues can be 0, but not negative)?","['statistics', 'matrices']"

But my approach requires the associativity of function composition. Let $f:  X \rightarrow Y, g:  Y \rightarrow Z, h:  Z \rightarrow W$ be functions. $((f \circ g) \circ h)(x) = h((f \circ g)(x)) = h(g(f(x)))$, and $(f \circ (g \circ h))(x) = (g \circ h)(f(x)) = h(g(f(x)))$.

When I consulted ProofWiki, whose link is at the bottom, I got even more confused.  Specifically, for $(f \circ g) \circ h = f \circ (g \circ h)$ to be defined, ProofWiki requires that dom$g =$ codom$f$ and dom$h =$ codom$g$. First of all, I think that it should be dom$g =$ range$f$ ....  Moreover, as you can see in the example below, you actually have to adjust domains and ranges of $f, g, h$ for the requirement to hold true. Let $f: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$ be $f(x) = 2x$, $g: \mathbb R^+ \rightarrow \mathbb R$ be $g(y) = ln(y)$, $h: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$ be $h(z) = z - 10$. Then $((f \circ g) \circ h)(x) = ln(2x) - 10 = (f \circ (g \circ h))(x)$, with dom$((f \circ g) \circ h) = \mathbb R^+$ = dom$(f \circ (g \circ h))$.  As a result, we need to set dom$f = \mathbb R^+$, range$f = \mathbb R^+$; dom$g$, range$g$, dom$h$, and range$h$ remain the same.  Am I allowed to do that? This adjustment implies that when we say dom$f = X$, $f$ must be defined for all elements in $X$, but $X$ may not be the entire set of elements for which $f$ is defined. http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Composition_of_Mappings_is_Associative","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions', 'function-and-relation-composition']"

523951,"Representation for a function that, when added/multiplied/composed with another function of the same form, yields a new function of the same form","I apologize for the possibly unclear wording of the title. I'm not well versed in math terminology. I'm after a concrete representation of a function, eg $y(x) = Ax^p$ (where $A$ and $p$ are constant), where multiplying $y_1(x)$ by $y_2(x)$, $(A_1x^{p_1})(A_2x^{p_2})$, results in a function of the same form*. In this case, $y_3(x) = y_1(x)*y_2(x) = A_1A_2x^{p_1+p_2}$, which, after combining constants, could be represented in the original form: $y_3(x) = y_1(x)*y_2(x) = A_3x^{p_3}$ However, I want this to also be true when adding two such functions, and composing them as in $y_3(x) = y_1(y_2(x))$. The example function can be composed, but does not appear to be addable. The constraints upon $y(x)$ is that the function must be able to pass through 3 provided points, which are guaranteed to either be all increasing or all decreasing (thus $y(x)$ will be either purely increasing or purely decreasing on its domain, though an operation involving $y(x)$ may result in a function that is not purely increasing/decreasing). *any operation involving two functions $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$ must return a piecewise function composed solely of pieces in the form of $y(x)$. In the examples, the resulting functions can be considered to be piecewise functions with only one piece. If no such functional representation exists, I'd like to find a suitable alternative that can approximate the addition/multiplication/composition operations, perhaps through the use of many pieces. Additional context for those who may find use in it: Initially, I have a set of points in 2-dimensional space (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...) which I am to connect in a specific way - form a function that connects points 1, 2 and 3 smoothly and with no points of inflection or local extrema between point 1 and 3, then connect points 3, 4, and 5 smoothly & with no inflection/extrema between point 3 and 5 (though the curve could easily have a cusp at point 3), then connect points 5, 6, 7 smoothly, and so on. In general, a polynomial satisfies the majority of my requirements, but as I perform many operations on these polynomials, their degree becomes very high and it becomes too computationally expensive to evaluate the polynomial accurately. So, I've decided that the most obvious thing to do is represent my curve as a piecewise function of pieces that connect 3 points in the defined way. Thus my initial function of pieces in the form of $y(x)$ is exact and not an approximation. The difficulty comes in that I have many of these piecewise functions that I need to multiply, add, or compose with eachother. Addition/multiplication operations can be reduced to first splitting pieces such that each critical value of x where the functions change from one piece to the other is aligned, then performing the operation on the individual corresponding pieces of each function and concatenating the resulting pieces to form a new piecewise function. Composition can be achieved in a similar piece-by-piece way. In order to preserve the same form, each operation on each piece, $y(x)$, must result in a sequence of pieces each in the form $y_n(x)$. I mentioned approximation earlier because I am not sure that an exact solution is possible.","['approximation', 'functions']"
523969,Do all diagonalisable matrices have orthogonal eigenvectors?,"So. Let us label right-eigenvectors of $M$ as $|\lambda\rangle$ and left-eigenvectors of $M$ as $\langle\lambda|$. That is,

\begin{gather}
M|\lambda\rangle = \lambda |\lambda\rangle \text{ and } \langle\mu| M = \langle\mu| \mu ,

I just looked at the four possible cases, $x \in A, x \in B$ $x \in A, x \notin B$ $x \notin A, x \in B$ $x \notin A, x \notin B$ and showed that each definition does give the symmetric difference in all of the four cases. I think that's all that's needed. So for the first definition, $D = (A \backslash B) \cup (B \backslash A)$: If $x \in A, x \in B$, then $x \notin A \backslash B$ or $x \notin B \backslash A$ by definition, so it's not in $(A \backslash B) \cup (B \backslash A)$ either. Therefore $x \notin D$. If $x \in A, x \notin B$, then $x \in A \backslash B$, but $x \notin B \backslash A$, by definition, so $ x \in D$. If $x \notin A, x \in B$, this is basically the same as point 2, so $x \in D$. If $x \notin A, x \notin B$, then $x \notin A \backslash B$ and $x \notin B \backslash A$, by definition, so $x \notin D$. For the second definition, $D = (A \cup B) \backslash (A \cap B)$: If $x \in A, x \in B$, then $x \in (A \cup B)$ and $x \in (A \cap B)$, so by definition of the complement, $x \notin D$. If $x \in A, x \notin B$, then $x \in (A \cup B)$, but $x \notin (A \cap B)$, so again by definition of the complement, $ x \in D$.

Definitions : A real number x is said to be positive if can be written as a formal limit of a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers $(x_n)$ which is positively bounded away from zero, i.e., $\,x_n\ge c$ for each n, where $c$ is a positive rational number. Proposition : Given any two real numbers $x<y$, we can find a rational number $q$ such that $x<q<y$. Proof: It will suffice to find two rational numbers such that $x\le q_1<q_2 \le y$, because we can define $q= \frac{q_1+q_2}{2}$ and we're done. Let  $(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$, $(b_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be  Cauchy sequences such that their formal limits are the real number $y$ and $x$ respectively. Since $y-x$ is a positive real number there exists a positive rational number $c$ such that $y-x>c$. Let $\,\epsilon= c/6$. Then there exists sufficient large $N_{\epsilon}\in \mathbb{N}$ such that: $|a_n-a_m|\le \epsilon$, $|b_n-b_m|\le \epsilon$ occurs simultaneously for all $n,m\ge N_{\epsilon}$. Moreover the sequence $(a_n-b_n)$ is eventually greater than $c$, let $M$ be the natural number such that $ a_n-b_n \ge  c$ for all $n\ge M$. We set $N =max(N_{\epsilon}, M)$. Now let us fix some $n_0$ such that $n_0\ge N$. Then clearly $|y - a_{n_0}|\le c/6$ and  $|x-b_{n_0}|\le c/6$ at the same time. We claim that  $a_{n_0}-\frac{c}{6}$ and $b_{n_0}+\frac{c}{6}$ have the desired property. 
It is not difficult to see that both are rational numbers, follows immediately by construction so, we will show that $a_{n_0}-\frac{c}{6}\le y$, $x\le b_{n_0}+\frac{c}{6}$ and $a_{n_0}-\frac{c}{6}>b_{n_0}+\frac{c}{6}$. We already know that $|y - a_{n_0}|\le c/6$, so  $a_{n_0}-c/6\le y \le a_{n_0}+c/6$ as desired. A similar argument shows that $x\le b_{n_0}+c/6$. To conclude the proof our task is to show $b_{n_0}+c/6<a_{n_0}-c/6$.  We argue by contradiction, suppose $b_{n_0}+c/6\ge a_{n_0}-c/6$ then $c/3\ge a_{n_0}-b_{n_0}$. But since $n_0\ge N$, it follows that  $a_{n_0}-b_{n_0}\ge c$ and then $c/3\ge c$ a contradiction. We define $q$ as the average of $a_{n_0}-\frac{c}{6}$ and $b_{n_0}+\frac{c}{6}$ and we're done. I would appreciate for any suggestion. Thanks in advance. :)","['self-learning', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

Since the bottom row of the matrix is all zero, wouldn't the columns span R^3? However, the answer in the textbook is that the columns do not span R^3.

continuous on $X$ if and only $f^{-1}\left(V\right)$ is open in
$X$ for every open set $V$ in $Y$. So lets say I define the simple linear function $f(x)=x$ as a function
$f:\left[0,1\right]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. Personally I believe this
function to be continuous, but I cannot make it fit with the definition. If I choose the open set as, say, $V=\left(-1,2\right)$, I find the
pre-image to be $f^{-1}\left(V\right)=\left\{ \left.x\in X\right|f\left(x\right)\in V\right\} =\left[0,1\right]$,

Show that the sequence converges to the point $x$ if and only if the sequence $\pi_\alpha (x_1), \pi_\alpha (x_2)\ldots$ converges to $\pi_\alpha (x)$ for each $\alpha$. Is this fact true for box topology instead of product topology? But what does it mean to converge in product topology? Is it that a common neighborhood exists for all points in the sequence?","['general-topology', 'convergence-divergence', 'product-space']"
524487,Why is the tangent space to a real projective plane two dimensional?,"Let P be the projective plane obtained by identifying antipode points on the unit sphere. How to prove that the tangent space at $q \in P$ to the projective plane P is 2 dimensional? My questions are 1, P is not a submanifold of the Euclidean space and its tangent vectors are defined in terms of equivalence classes. How to show that there exist two linearly independent tangent vectors? 2  I hope someone can give me detailed, elementary proof without using more advanced facts--I am just starting out.

524491,Prove $A \cap B = A − (A − B)$,"$A$ and $B$ are sets, how would I prove the following equality: $A∩B = A-(A-B)$ Would I be correct in saying that if I take $x$ to be in $A-(A-B)$, it means that $x$ is in $A$, but not in $A-B$. Now, suppose temporarily that $x$ was not in $A∩B$, however, we already know that $x$ is in $A$, so that means $x$ cannot be in $B$. But then, since $x$ is in $A$, but not in $B$, $x$ must be in $A-B$, which contradicts what I just discovered. Therefore, $x$ must be in $A∩B$. Suppose $x$ is in $A∩B$, then $x$ is in both $A$ and $B$. I know from this that $x$ cannot be a part of $A-B$ because that would imply that $x$ is part of $A$, but not part of $B$. Since $x$ is already part of $A$, but not part of $A-B$, it follows by definition that $x$ is in $A-(A-B)$. Would I be correct in saying this? I can write these proofs out in words but my notation is poor, how would I write this in strict set notation?",['elementary-set-theory']

524530,On the existence of $\sqrt{2}$ (guided),"Introduction : This is a homework assignment of mine, first I want to mention that I am aware of that there are many proofs all over the internet (including this site) about the existence of $\sqrt{2}$. However, in my assignment I am somewhat 'guided' through it with some vague steps and I would enjoy to understand them, or at least have an idea about what they are trying to tell me. Problem : Show the existence of $\sqrt{2}$, which means that: $\exists b \in \mathbb{R}, b \geq 0, b^2=2$ by using the following: (a) Define $Y=\lbrace a \in \mathbb{R} : a \geq 0 , a^2 \geq 2 \rbrace$ (b) Show that $b:= \inf Y$ exists (c) Show that $b \geq 0$ and $ b^2=2$ hint : Consider $a=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{2}{b^2}\right), \ a'=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{b^2}{2}\right)$ and the values $b(1-a)$ and $\frac{b}{1-a'}$ My approach : The given set $Y= \lbrace a \in \mathbb{R}: a \geq 0, a^2 \geq 2 \rbrace$ clearly is nonempty, for instance $5 \in Y$, thus $Y \neq \emptyset$. For (b) I simply said that i.e. $1$ is a lower bound for $Y$, hence $Y$ is closed from below and there exists a greatest lower bound $b:= \inf Y$. From all the resources I have read I have an idea how to proceed, I must assume that $b^2 > 2$ and lead this to a contradiction and do the same with $b^2 <2$. If both $b^2 >2$ and $b^2 < 2$ are false then $b^2=2$. In the papers I have read they do it as follows (usually with the Supremum). They subtract a positive number from the supremum such that no member of the Set is larger than it, this would lead to a contradiction (since the Supremum is the least upper bound) In my case I would have to increase the Infimum by a positive number and show that no member of the set $Y$ is smaller than it. My approach (cont.) with the given hints : I considered the first case where $b^2>2$ then I came up with the following inequalitites:
\begin{align}b^2>2 \implies 1> \frac{2}{b^2} \implies 1>1-\frac{2}{b^2}>0 \\\text{s.t. }\frac{1}{2}> \frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{2}{b^2}\right)>0  \end{align}
So I could substitute $a=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{2}{b^2}\right)$ and say $a \in \left]0, \frac{1}{2}\right[$ Unfortunately I am stuck here, it looks to me like $a$ is another lower bound of $Y$ but it doesn't seem to me to be strictly greater than the Infimum of $Y$. I don't see how I can bring this information up to be a contradiction. I would appreciate some hints/comments about how I could continue from here, and whether or not the given values $b(1-a)$ and $\frac{b}{1-a'}$ can be helpful. I apologize that this problem seems so vague, but I'd much rather continue with the given informations than copying a already existent proof from the internet.",['analysis']
524543,Euclidean algorithm for ordinals,"I am trying to prove the Euclidean algorithm for ordinals. More specifically:
For any ordinals $\alpha, \beta$ where $\beta >0$, there are unique $\gamma, \delta$ such that $\alpha = \beta\gamma+\delta$ and $\delta<\beta$. For now, I have difficulties. For example, I am not sure what to do when, $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal and $\beta$ is finite (a natural number).. since ""diminishing"" multiples of $\beta$ from $\alpha$ will not help.. and I don't really have an action of division... Can anyone help? maybe give me a clue or a direction?? Thanks!
