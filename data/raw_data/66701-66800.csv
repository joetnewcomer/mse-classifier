792414,Twice differentiable implies equality of mixed partials?,"I have seen the following theorem claimed in several places: Claim: If a function $f$ of two variables has partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ which are defined in a neighborhood of $(a,b)$ and are also differentiable at $(a,b)$, then the mixed partials are equal: $f_{xy}= f_{yx}$. This is a stronger claim than what I find in most textbooks and also on Wikipedia , which also assumes that the second partial derivatives are continuous. If the above claim is true, where can I find a proof of it?  And if not, what is a counterexample?  (The latter is basically this question .) It is stated on page 201 or 220 (maybe depending on edition) of Advanced Calculus by Angus Taylor, but no proof is given. I have also found it in a 1908 paper called On Differentials by W. H. Young in Proc. LMS, but I don't believe the proof given.  He uses differentiability of $f_x$ to show that $$ \frac{f_x(x+h,y+k) - f_x(x+h,y)}{k} = \frac{h}{k}e + f_{yx} + e' $$ where $e,e'\to 0$ as $(h,k)\to 0$, and therefore that the LHS goes to $f_{yx}$ as $(h,k)\to 0$ ""provided $h/k$ does not become infinite"".  Similarly, $\frac{f_y(x+h,y+k) - f_y(x,y+k)}{h} \to f_{xy}$ as $(h,k)\to 0$ ""provided $k/h$ does not become infinite"".  Then he roughly follows the usual proof of equality of mixed partials, using the mean value theorem to show that $$ \frac{f(x+h,y+k)-f(x+h,y) - f(x,y+k) + f(x,y)}{hk} = \frac{f_y(x+h,y+\theta k) - f_y(x,y+\theta k)}{h} $$ for some $0<\theta<1$, and dually.  Then he says ""if $(h,k)$ moves towards $(0,0)$ in such a way that $h/k$ has not zero as limit, $h/\theta k$ will not have zero for a limit"", so that the RHS above goes to $f_{xy}$, and dually also to $f_{yx}$.  But it seems to me that $\theta$ depends on $h$ and $k$, so there is no reason it might not blow up as $(h,k)\to 0$ even if $h/k$ has a finite nonzero limit.  Is there some reason why this works?","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"

Since this is a Boolean relation, all values must be either 0 or 1.

792449,Proof of continuity - (ε-δ) definition - Can anyone check this?,"I've been trying to get my head around this problem for quite some time by now. 
I want to prove that $$f(x) := \left|\frac{x-1}{x^2+1}\right|$$ is continuous for $$x_0 = -1$$ Now, in order to prove this, I want to use to ε-δ defintion which states that for any given $\varepsilon$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that $$\left|x-x_0\right| < \delta \Rightarrow \left|f(x)-f(x_0)\right|<\varepsilon$$ I'm fairly new to the concepts of analysis; but I understand that in order to conduct these sorts of proofs, you first need to spend a few minutes to find out a reasonable value for $\delta$. Unfortunately, I can't find any particular ""rules"" on how to do that. So, I first tried to fill in some gaps for my particular problem: Given $\varepsilon > 0$, we can find $\delta > 0$ such that, if $\left|x-(-1)\right| = \left|x+1\right| < \delta$, then $$\left|\frac{x-1}{x^2+1}-(-1)\right|=\left|\frac{x-1}{x^2+1}+1\right|=\left|\frac{x²+x}{x^2+1}\right|<\varepsilon$$ My plan is now to take care of the implication first. That is, I want to paraphrase $\left|\frac{x²+x}{x^2+1}\right|<\varepsilon$ in a way that makes sure that the actual $\varepsilon > 0$ chosen does not matter at all. So, in the end, I think manipulating $\left|\frac{x²+x}{x^2+1}\right|<\varepsilon$ to look like $\left|x+1\right| < ε \cdot \varphi$ would be my goal, right? Because then, if we let $\delta := \varepsilon \cdot \varphi$, the implication holds. I hope everything to this point was correct. Now, I find $$\left|\frac{x²+x}{x^2+1}\right| = \left|\frac{x(x^2+1)}{x+1}\right| = \left|x+1\right|\left|\frac{x}{x^2+1}\right|<\varepsilon$$ which is why I would want to let $\delta := \frac{\varepsilon}{\left|\frac{x}{x^2+1}\right|}$ (which looks quite ugly, point taken). Is my choice of $\delta$ okay? I never saw a $\delta$ contain $x$ as a variable before, my professor always somehow managed to set $\delta$ to $\varepsilon$ times some constant $\varphi$, but I can't seem to do it. Can anyone check my current steps and help me find a constant $\varphi$, if this is necessary for the proof I'm building up?","['epsilon-delta', 'convergence-divergence', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

792522,Central Limit Theorem for uncorrelated (non-independent) but bounded random variables,"Given uncorrelated, discrete random variables $X_i$ that are bounded, e.g., they can only take on values $|X_i| \leq 4$, then is there a form of the central limit theorem that one can apply to the sum, $\sum_{i=1}^N X_i$? In other words, is there a form of central limit theorem that applies to identical, non-independent (but uncorrelated) random variables that are bounded? The best I've been able to find is the case of $M$-dependence for stationary RVs, where RVs more than $M$ apart (in time) can be assumed independent and thus CLT applies. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or pointers! Background: Here is the background problem I am applying this to: Given the arrays $C=[C_1,C_2,...,C_N]$ and $S=[S_1,S_2,...,S_N]$  of lengths $N$ with elements that are discrete iid uniform distributed with equal probability (p=1/2) of being $\pm$1. Consider the sum below, for a constant $k \in [1,N]$: \begin{equation*}  
 A=\underset{m\neq l, n\neq l}{\underset{-l+m+n=k}{\sum_{l=1}^N \sum_{m=1}^N \sum_{n=1}^N}} C_lC_mC_n+S_lS_mC_n-C_lS_mS_n+S_lC_mS_n 
    \end{equation*} Each combination of $l, m, n$ results in a sum of four pairwise independent Bernoulli RVs, I denote this sum of four RVs as $X_i$ where $X_i=C_lC_mC_n+S_lS_mC_n-C_lS_mS_n+S_lC_mS_n$. The $X_i$ are thus identical, uncorrelated and bounded, $|X_i| \leq 4$. The other option I am considering is breaking $A$ into two parts but I am still working on it: \begin{equation*}  
 A=Y+Z=\underset{m\neq l, n\neq l}{\underset{-l+m+n=k}{\sum_{l=1}^N \sum_{m=1}^N \sum_{n=1}^N}} C_lC_mC_n+ \underset{m\neq l, n\neq l}{\underset{-l+m+n=k}{\sum_{l=1}^N \sum_{m=1}^N \sum_{n=1}^N}} (S_lS_mC_n-C_lS_mS_n+S_lC_mS_n)
    \end{equation*} Simulation results show good match to a Normal distribution for $A$.","['probability-theory', 'central-limit-theorem', 'normal-distribution', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"
792528,Simple proof of the structure theorems for finite abelian groups,"Many proofs of the structure theorems for finite abelian groups first reduce to the problem to $p$-groups, which is fine and is an important technique. However, it seems to me that a simple proof can be based on this one crucial result: Every finite abelian group has a cyclic direct factor. $\qquad(\star)$ From this, it follows at once by induction on the order of the group that Every finite abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups. The Chinese remainder theorem then allows us to split these cyclic groups into cyclic $p$-groups and so we get the primary decomposition theorem : Every finite abelian group is a direct product of cyclic $p$-groups. The Chinese remainder theorem then allows us to reassemble these into an invariant factor decomposition. Note that the proof is really easy once we have the crucial result $\star$ (and the Chinese remainder theorem of course). I think Mac Lane and Birkoff in their Algebra do something along this line but it is not very simple. Does anyone know a proof of the structure theorems along the lines above? In particular, is there a simple proof of the crucial result $\star$ ? (A side bonus would be a simple characterization of the cyclic subgroups that are direct factors of a given finite abelian group: I expect they are exactly the maximal cyclic subgroups.)","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abelian-groups']"

What is the distribution of $X_1^2 + X_2^2$? My approach is that 
$X_1\sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ and $X_2\sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ Then $X_1^2$ and $X_2^2$ have chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom. (I am not sure the degree of freedom and not sure how to show it as well(please help on this)) Then I found the moment-generating function for $X_1^2$ and $X_2^2$;$$m_{X_1^2} = (1-2t)^{-1/2}$$ and $$m_{X_2^2} = (1-2t)^{-1/2}$$ So the moment generating function for $X_1^2 + X_2^2$ is $$m_{X_1^2}(t) m_{X_2^2}(t) = (1-2t)^{-2/2}$$ So $X_1^2 + X_2^2$ has a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.

792559,Curse of Dimensionality ... as illustrated by Christopher Bishop,"I'm reading Christopher Bishop's book ""Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition"". I'm on pg 7 about curse of dimensionality. 
Here is the relevant part: For simplicity assume the dimensionality we are working with is 3. Now ""divide the input variables $x_1, \dots x_d$ into M intervals, so that the value of a variable can be specified approximately by saying in which interval it lies. This leads to a division of the whole input space into a large number of [3D] boxes or cells ...
Each of the training examples corresponds to a point in one of the cells , and carries an associated value of the output variable $y$. ... [To find $y$ for a given point], by finding which cell the point falls in, and then returning the average value of y for all training points that lie in that cell."" The claim is that if each input variable is divided into $M$ divisions, then the total number of cells is $M^d$. First and foremost, why is this true? Why do we need $M^d$ cells? Secondly, what does it mean to divide an input variable into intervals or divisions. (I assume an input variable is $x_i$ from $x_1, \dots, x_d$ for $1\leq i \leq d$.) I'm interested in making sure that I understand this because this seems (at least to me) a clever way of thinking about the curse of dimensionality.","['statistics', 'machine-learning']"

Suppose $I$  is a set, and $P(I)$ is its power set, viewed as a category whose arrows are set inclusion.

U & {\to} & V\\

X & \stackrel{\varphi}{\to} & X' \\

$$N = \{ (q, v) \left. \right| q \in M, v \in \mathbb{R}^n \text{ is perpendicular to } M \text{ at } q \} \subset M \times \mathbb{R}^n.$$ Show that $N$ is an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold. My thoughts so far: Let $(q,v) \in N$. Since $M$ is a $k$-dim. manifold we can choose an open neighbourhood $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of $q$ and an open subset $V \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ and a diffeomorphism 
$\varphi: M \cap U \rightarrow V$. Consider (for fixed $q$) the set
$$A := \{ (q,w) \left. \right| w \in \mathbb{R}^n \text{ perpendicular to } M \text{ at } q \}.$$
Since the tangent space $T_qM$ is a $k$-dim subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $A$ is a vector space itself with $\mathbb{R}^n = T_qM \oplus A$, we know that $A$ is in fact an $(n-k)$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Therefore I suspect that we could just consider the open neighbourhood $U \times \mathbb{R}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ of the point $(q,v)$. If we intersect this with $N$ we should get something like 
$$(U \cap M) \times ((n-k)\text{-dim. subspace of } \mathbb{R}^n)$$
which we should be able to map diffeomorphically onto an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ of the form $V \times \mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ via the map $\varphi \times id$. Is my argumentation somewhat correct?

793135,Making a biased coin flip fair,"I have a puzzle: Two groups want to break a tied vote using a 
  simple coin flip, however the only coin they have 
  available is a biased coin (i.e., one side will come 
  up more often than the other). To make matters 
  worse nobody in the room knows (or is willing to 
  admit) how the coin is biased. Assuming that the coin has two distinct sides, 
  design a method for using only this coin to 
  determine a fair outcome between the two parties. Initially, I thought, since neither party knows how the coin is biased, then either party could simply randomly guess which side the coin will land on and then they will receive a 50% chance they are correct (and 50% chance they are incorrect). This is assuming they are not influenced by any knowledge that they know for how the coin is biased when randomly deciding (or rather they do not know how it is biased). I even performed a simulation on this for a large amount of trials ( live demo in python ). However, I stumbled upon this wikipedia article , which mentions an alternative method. If a cheat has altered a coin to prefer one side over another (a biased coin), the coin can still be used for fair results by changing the game slightly. John von Neumann gave the following procedure: Toss the coin twice. If the results match, start over, forgetting both results. If the results differ, use the first result, forgetting the second. I'm just curious: is my method of solving the puzzle a viable solution? It seems so, but I'm not 100% certain.","['statistics', 'puzzle', 'probability']"

793229,Are $C^{\infty}$ completely defined by their derivatives?,"This question has been on my mind for some time. Here's my process. Firstly, is it possible to construct a function such that it's defined with a different expression on different intervals, but that it's still in $C^{\infty}$? For example, say we define a function like this: $f(x)=\cos x$ for $x\ge0$ $f(x)=1 + \sin (x)$ for $x\le0$ The function is continuous. It's first derivative is $f'(x)=-\sin x$ for $x\ge0$ $f'(x)=\cos x$ for $x\le0$ Not continuous. If I chose two functions and match their values AND first derivatives, they differ in the third derivative. If I match that one also, the differ in the fourth... well, you get the point. So I was thinking, could it be that a function in $C^{\infty}$ is fully defined by all it's derivatives in a single point? 
If I want to make a polynomial that aproximates the $\sin$ function, I can make it of an arbitrarily high degree and match as many derivatives as I want. Say I have a sequence of functions $g_n$, such that $g_n^{(i)}(x_0)=\sin^{(i)}(x_0)$ for every $i\in\{0,...,n\}$. Is $\lim_n g_n=\sin$?

On the other hand, the RHS limit may exist without $f$ being twice differentiable.  For instance, if $f(x) = x^3 \sin(1/x)$ for $x\neq 0$ and $f(0)=0$, then at $a=0$ the RHS is $2h(4\sin(1/2h) - \sin(1/h))$, which has limit $0$; but this function $f$ is not twice differentiable at $0$. My question is, under what additional hypotheses can we conclude from the existence of the RHS limit that $f$ is twice differentiable? We probably need to assume that $f$ is once differentiable on a neighborhood of $a$, but that is not sufficient since the counterexample above is in fact smooth at all points $x\neq 0$.  For the same reason, it is not sufficient to assume that the above limit exists for all $a$ in some neighborhood. Note that this is not the same as this question , which is asking for a limit definition of the second derivative that doesn't require extra hypotheses; here I'm asking what extra hypotheses can be added to this particular definition to make it work.","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"

  property that: $$\int_a^b f(x) dx$$ is the proportion of numbers that
  have leading digits ranging from a to b. For a small increment $\Delta x$ in x, f must satisfy (Ed: I leave out a figure that shows the same
  graphically) $$f(1) * \Delta x = f(x) * x \Delta x$$ because $f(1) * \Delta x$ is, approximately, the proportion of numbers
  ranging from 1 to 1 + $\Delta x$ (ignoring a multiplier of a power of
  10), and $f(x) * x \Delta x$ is the approximate proportion of numbers

  first multiplied by x, their proportions must be equal. The rest of it is very straight-forward, but I don't understand the bolded sentence which is the justification for the whole approach.

793638,Find the points in the graph (my solution) - high school.,"my math problem is on Swedish so i'll try my best to translate it so you can understand. I'd appreciate it if someone could point out if I did anything wrong and if there is anything that I should add that's essential to these kind of problems. (I'm a high school student in my second year) The function $f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2$ gives us the points A and B
  on the graph and the second function, $g(x) = x^2 - 7x + 14$ gives C
  and D, where C is a mutual point for these two functions. C has a
  gradient that is -3. To start off with, I set the x for $f(x)$ to 0 in order to see where on the y-axis the point A crosses. $f(0) = 0^3 - 6*0^2 + 9*0 + 2 = 2$ $A(0,2)$ The next step is to figure out B. To be able to get the coordinates for this point, I have to derivate $f(x)$, and then set $f'(x)=0$. $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0$ $3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0$ Dividing everything with 3 to use the pq-formula. $x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$ $x = 2  \pm{\sqrt {2^2-3}}$ $x_1 = 2+1 = 3$ $x_2 = 2-1 = 1$ With these 2 x-values I have to choose one that gives the biggest value for $f(x)$ point B is a Maximum point on the graph that has been provided. I can find this out with the help of Second Derivative. $f''(x) = 6x - 12$ $f''(3) = 6*3 - 12 = 6$ This is a minimum point because of $f'(3) = 0$ and $f''(3) > 0$. $f''(1) = 6*1 - 12 = -6$ This is the x-value that gives the maximum point that I am looking for. $f'(1) = 0$ and $f''(1) < 0$ $f(1) = 1^3 - 6*1^2 + 9*1 + 2 = 6$ $B(1,6)$ As stated earlier, C is a mutual point with a gradient -3. Derivating both functions and setting them equal to -3 and solving these will give us which x-value they have in common. $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = -3$ $3x^2 - 12x + 9 = -3$ +3 on both sides to get everything on one side then dividing everything with 3 to get x^2 alone so I can use pq-formula. $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$ $x = 2  \pm {\sqrt {2^2-4}}$ $x = 2$ On to the second function: $g(x) = x^2 - 7x + 14$ I set $g'(x) = -3$ By derivating this function and moving -7 to the right side will give us:
$2x = 4$ Dividing both sides with 2 $x = 2$ $f(2) = 2^3 - 6*2^2 + 9*2 + 2 = 4$ $g(2) = 2^2 - 7*2 + 14 = 4$ $f(2)=g(2)=4$ $C(2,4)$ To get the last point (D) I do the exact same way as I did for point B. I derivate the function and set g'(x) = 0 to solve x. To confirm that D is a Min.Point I derivate the first derivative and this gives me $g''(x) = 2$. We can see that $g''(x) > 0$. $g'(x) = 2x - 7 = 0$ $2x = 7$ $x = 3.5$ $g(3.5) = 3.5^2 - 7*3.5 + 14 = 1.75$ $D(3.5;1.75)$ Answer:

793970,The First Homology Group Obtained by Attaching a Möbius Strip to a Torus in a Certain Way.,"Let $ M $ and $ \mathbb{T}^{2} $ denote the Möbius strip and the torus respectively. Suppose that we attach $ M $ to $ \mathbb{T}^{2} $ by wrapping the boundary circle $ C $ of $ M $ around the first circle of the torus $ k $ times, i.e., we have a continuous attaching map $ f: C \to \mathbb{S}^{1} \times \{ 1 \} \subseteq \mathbb{T}^{2} $ with winding number $ k $. Then what would be the first homology group of the resulting adjunction space $ X = M \sqcup_{f} \mathbb{T}^{2} $? Set theoretically, we have
$$
X = (M \times \{ 0 \}) \cup (\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}) \Big/ \sim,
$$
where $ \sim $ is the equivalence relation defined by $ (x,0) \sim (f(x),1) $ for all $ x \in M $. Next, consider the following two subspaces of $ X $:
$$
A = [M \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} \quad \text{and} \quad
B = [\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim}.
$$
Their intersection is $ [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} = [(\mathbb{S}^{1} \times \{ 1 \}) \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim} $. Pick an open neighborhood $ U $ of $ A $ and an open neighborhood $ V $ of $ B $ such that $ U $ and $ V $ deformation retract onto $ A $ and $ B $ respectively. Then $ U \cap V $ deformation retracts onto $ A \cap B = [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} $. As $ \{ U,V \} $ is an open cover of $ X $, we can apply the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to it. My problem is figuring out what the mapping
$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
{H_{1}}(U \cap V) @>{i_{*} \oplus j_{*}}>> {H_{1}}(U) \oplus {H_{1}}(V)
\end{CD}

looks like. Deformation retraction reduces this problem to analyzing the mapping
$$

{H_{1}}([C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim}) @>{i_{*} \oplus j_{*}}>>
{H_{1}}([M \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim}) \oplus {H_{1}}([\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim}).
\end{CD}
$$
My questions are: Is $ [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} $ homeomorphic to $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $? This is not very straightforward because $ \sim $ collapses sets of $ k $ points in $ C \times \{ 0 \} $ to singletons. In the case $ k = 2 $, I know that the answer is ‘yes’ because $ \sim $ restricted to $ C \times \{ 0 \} $ behaves as if it were identifying antipodal points in $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $, and it is well-known that identifying antipodal points in $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $ produces $ \mathbb{RP}^{1} $, which is homeomorphic to $ \mathbb{S}^{1} $. Suppose that the answer to the above question is ‘yes’ for $ k $ in general. Then how does the homology class of a fundamental cycle $ \gamma $ in $ [C \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim} $ map to $ {H_{1}}([M \times \{ 0 \}]_{\sim}) $ under $ i_{*} $? I believe that the answer to this is
$$
(i_{*})([\gamma]) = \pm 2 \cdot [\text{Generating core loop of $ M $}],
$$
where the sign depends on which orientation we are using. Similarly, how does $ [\gamma] $ map to $ {H_{1}}([\mathbb{T}^{2} \times \{ 1 \}]_{\sim}) $ under $ j_{*} $?","['general-topology', 'quotient-spaces', 'homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-topology']"

For $n=1$, that is basically the Standard score . With $M = 1_n$ and $b = \operatorname{E}[X]$, I get it mean-normalized but not variance-normalized. With $M$ being a non-negative symmetric square root of $\operatorname{var}(X)^{-1}$, we get $\operatorname{var}(Y) = 1_n$. We can choose $b$ as in case 1. I want to estimate $M$ and $b$ based on some running/moving algorithm. For the first case, this is easy: For every new $x$, I can use the update rule $$b \leftarrow x \alpha + b (1 - \alpha)$$ for some $\alpha$. I could set $\alpha = 1/N$ and set $N \leftarrow N + 1$ in every iteration, starting with $N = 1$. How would I do something similar for the second case, esp. for $M$? I could use a similar update rule to calculate the covariance matrix, e.g. $$\Sigma \leftarrow (x - b) (x - b)^T \alpha + \Sigma (1- \alpha) $$ but I'm not sure how well that works in practice (also, I haven't really seen that formula in such form) or if that even converges (given that it uses also the moving $b$). Also, if I use this, I only have an estimation of $\operatorname{var}(X)$ but I still need the $M$. I probably could use another estimation to get the $M$ based on the $\Sigma$ (which one?), but I wonder if I could just get an estimation of $M$ more directly. (I asked the same question also on MetaOptimize .)","['statistics', 'normal-distribution', 'probability', 'covariance']"
794373,What should a student (with algebraic-geometry minded) study in differential geometry?,"One of my friend who is an undergraduate student, has known something about algebraic geometry (equivalent to chapter 1 and a little bit chapter 2 in GTM 52 by Hartshorne). He is now has to study a differential geometry course. Since there are a lot of Differential geometry text books with different intention, he asked me what he should learn in differential geometry so that it helps him to improve his knowledge in algebraic geometry I can not answer this question so I decided to post it here. Please help him. Thanks.","['differential-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request', 'soft-question', 'advice']"
