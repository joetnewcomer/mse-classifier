4094859,Geometric interpretation of symmetries of a manifold,"I have been doing some reading about Lie groups and algebras and stumble across the phrase that those theories ""measure"" the symmetries of the manifolds, like an analog of the groups that measure the symmetries of objects like a triangle, a polygon etc. I am trying to understand what that means.
I think I would understand better the above with 2 examples So lets take a 2-d manifold-a sphere. Does this mean that we have infinite symmetries? (how do we compute them mathematically meaning if someone ask how many symmetries a sphere has how do we answer that mathematically) can you give an example of a manifold that has a finite symmetry How can I think about the symmetries of a manifold? Thinking about an axes' rotation is probably wrong, so how do we think it geometrically?","['lie-algebras', 'physics', 'manifolds', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"
4094866,"Is the integral identity $\int d x \, f(x) \, \, g(f(x))' \, = \, 0$ true?","We have a positive function $f$ on a certain N-dimensional domain $E \subset  \mathbb{R}^N$ , namely $f(x)\geq 0$ for every $x\in E$ . The function is such that $f(x)=0$ on the boundary, when $x \in \partial E$ .
We also require that $$
\int_E d^Nx \, f(x)  \, = \, F >0
$$ is finite. Given a ""well behaved"" function $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ ,
how to prove that  (feel free to assume all the nice continuity properties you want for both $f$ and $g$ ) $$
\int_E d^Nx \, f(x) \, \nabla \, g(f(x)) \, = \, 0 \quad ?
$$ Attempt: probably the N-dimensional domain is a complication and it is possible to just consider the 1D case. If $g$ is the identity, by using the integration by parts we have $$
\int_E dx \, f \, \partial_x \, f \,=-\int_E dx \, (\partial_x f) \,  \, f 
$$ so in this simple case the statement is true. A similar argument holds also when $g(f) = f^a$ for some real power $a\neq -1$ such that the integrals are finite.","['integration', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'multiple-integral']"
4094867,Understanding an intuitive explanation of the derivative of $x^x$,"This question is related to this question here Can't argue with success? Looking for ""bad math"" that ""gets away with it"" The question is about ways to get the right answer with incorrect logic/methods. One of the answers with $104$ score by Hans Engler reads like this Here's another classical freshman calculus example: Find $\frac{d}{dx} x^x$ . Alice says ""this is like $\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n−1}$ , so the answer is $xx^{x−1}=x^x$ ."" Bob says ""no, this is like $\frac{d}{dx} a^x = \log{a}⋅a^x$ , so the answer is $\log{x}⋅x^x$ ."" Charlie says ""if you're not sure, just add the two terms, so you'll get partial credit"". The answer $\frac{d}{dx} x^x= (1+\log x)x^x$ turns out to be correct. Joriki in the comments of this answer states that That's not wrong; that's a perfectly valid method. You get the derivative of any expression with respect to x as the sums of all the derivatives with respect to the individual instances of x while holding all other instances constant. I am having trouble making sense of his comment, this is what I think it means. Imagine that the $x$ s in $x^x$ were different. Let's call them $x_1$ and $x_2$ . Thus, our expression becomes ${x_1}^{x_2}$ . I believe his comment is saying that the rate of change of ${x_1}^{x_2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} {x_1}^{x_2} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2} {x_1}^{x_2}$ . Each partial derivative evaluates the change in the quantity with respect to a different $x$ and sums them up while keeping the other $x$ constant, just like the comment says. However, I am not sure why this equality is true.","['partial-derivative', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

4095174,"Knowing that the first test was positive, what is the probability the second test will be positive?","Suppose that 5% of the employees of a certain company use illegal drugs. The company performs random drug tests that return positive results 98% of the time if the person is a drug user. However, it also has a 4% false-positive rate. The results of the test are independent from test to test for a given person. An employee at the company has a positive test. What is the probability that he uses drugs? Knowing that the first test was positive, what is the probability the second test will be positive? Suppose that the second test is also positive. What is the probability he uses drugs? My Attempt This one is straightforward.. From the problem, we know $$\mathbb{P}(positive|\;uses\;drugs)=0.98$$ $$\mathbb{P}(uses\;drugs)=0.05$$ $$\mathbb{P}(positive|doesn't\;use\;drugs)=0.04$$ $$\mathbb{P}(doesn't\;use\;drugs)=0.95$$ Then using Baye's Theorem, we have $$\mathbb{P}(Uses\;drugs)=\frac{(0.98)(0.05)}{(0.98)(0.05)+(0.04)(0.95)}=0.56$$ For this one, we are trying to find $\mathbb{P}(Second\;positive|first\;positive)$ . Since the results are independent from each other, we know that $\mathbb{P}(Second\;positive|first\;positive)=\mathbb{P}(second\;positive)$ . Would this mean that the second test being positive has the same probability as the first one? Intuitively, I would think that the probability is the same because the events are independent of each other, but I am not sure how to prove this. Edit: I think I can use the definition of conditional probability and the law of total probability to solve this problem. What I had above is wrong.
I can use the following to solve: $$\mathbb{P}(B\;|\;A)= \frac{\mathbb{P}(B\cap A)}{\mathbb{P}(A)}= \frac{\mathbb{P}(B\cap A\;|\;D)\mathbb{P}(D)+\mathbb{P}(B\cap A\;|\;D^c)\mathbb{P}(D^c)}{\mathbb{P}(A\;|\;D)\mathbb{P}(D)+\mathbb{P}(A\;|\;D^c)\mathbb{P}(D^c)}$$ For this one, I am trying to find $\mathbb{P}(Uses\;drugs|first\;positive\;\cap\;second\; positive)$ .

4095203,Understanding mathematical terminology in Aluffi,"I'm reading the first section of Aluffi's ""Algebra: Chapter 0"" and don't fully understand this below passage concerning naive set theory. But note that while it is clear from the definitions that, for example, $$S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 = (S_1 \cup S_2) \cup S_3 = S_2 \cup (S_2 \cup S_3),$$ it is not so clear in what sense the sets $$S_1 \times S_2 \times S_3, \; (S_1 \times S_2) \times S_3, \ S_1 \times (S_2 \times S_3) $$ should be `identified' (where we can define the leftmost set as the set of 'ordered triples' of elements of $S_1, S_2, S_3$ , by analogy with the definition for two sets.) In fact, again, we can really make sense of such statements only after we acquire the language of functions. However, all such statements do turn out to be true, as the reader probably expects; by virtue of this fortunate circumstances, we can be somewhat cavalier and gloss over such subtleties. My biggest confusion is the use of the word 'identified.' This is the second time the author uses this term with respect to a set.

4095211,Doubt in the geometric interpretation of Newton's method of calculating the roots of the equation $f(x)$.,"This is a question from Rudin(trying to prove the newtons method of calculating the roots of the function) and which aks me to state the geometric intuition of : $$x_n=x_{n-1}-\frac{f(x_{n-1})}{f'(x_{n-1})}$$ I know that the the line to the tangent at the graph at the point $(x_1,f(x_1))$ has the equation $y = f(x_1)+f'(x_1)(x-x_1)$ and it crosses the graph at the point $x_2$ which is given by the above equation. Now, while looking at the equation,I found something like this: $\frac{x_1.f(x_1+h)-f(x_1)(x_1+h)}{f(x_1+h)-f(x_1)}=x_2$ which forces me to think of the exterior division formula where $m=f(x_1+h)$ and $n= f(x_1)$ and the equation assumes the form $\frac{m.x_1-n(x_1+h)}{m-n}=x_2$ .Since $x_1 \in (\alpha,b)$ and $f(\alpha)=0(f(b)>0)$ and the point $x_2$ is the exterior point , so $x_2$ is closer to $\alpha$ .Why am I getting something similar to the exterior division formula?","['analysis', 'real-analysis']"
4095213,Deforming an approximate algebra into an exact algebra,"Consider a linear subspace of matrices, $M \subset \textrm{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})$ , which is $\epsilon$ - approximately closed under multiplication, i.e. for all $x,y \in M$ , there exists $z \in M$ such that $\lVert{xy-z}\rVert < \epsilon \lVert x \rVert \lVert y \rVert$ . Assume $M$ is closed under Hermitian adjoints.  Then you might say $M$ forms an "" $\epsilon$ -approximate"" $*$ -subalgebra of $\textrm{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})$ .  (We might also assume $M \ni 1$ and $M$ is approximately closed under inverses.) Have approximate $*$ -subalgebras of this sort been studied? I am familiar with some notions of Ulam stability, approximate homomorphisms, and approximate representations, but the setup here appears slightly different. ( $M$ is not given as the image of some approximate homomorphism from an actual algebra.) In particular, I'm interested in the following: Is it known whether $M$ may be slightly deformed so that it becomes an exact $*$ -subalgebra?  E.g., does there exist a subspace $N \subset \textrm{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})$ which is an exact $*$ -algebra, and which is nearby to the subspace $M$ , with distance controlled by $\epsilon$ ? If anyone's interested, I'll offer an example of a conjecture along these lines. For a von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{A}$ , call a linear subspace $M \subset \mathcal{A}$ $\epsilon$ -approximately multiplicatively closed if it is closed under $*$ , contains the identity, and satisfies the property that for all $x,y \in M$ , $\exists z \in M$ s.t. $\lVert{xy-z}\rVert < \epsilon \lVert x \rVert \lVert y \rVert$ . Also define a distance between two subspaces: for any linear subspaces $X,Y$ , let $d(X,Y)$ be the Hausdorff distance between their unit balls. Then one might conjecture: For every $\epsilon>0$ , there exists $\delta>0$ such that for any
finite-dimensional von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{A}$ , for any $\delta$ -approximately multiplicatively closed subspace $M \subset \mathcal{A}$ , there exists a von Neumann subalgebra $\mathcal{N} \subset \mathcal{A}$ such that $d(M,\mathcal{N})<\epsilon$ . The related literature I know seems to focus on maps between algebras which are approximately multiplicative, e.g. "" Approximately Multiplicative Maps Between Banach Algebras "" (Johnson, 1986).

I've been provided with the following definition regarding completeness of a probability space: Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ be a probability space and let $A \subset \Omega$ (not necessarily an element of $\mathcal{F}$ ). We say that $A$ is a null set if there exists $B \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $A \subset B$ and $\mathbb{P}(B)=0$ . We denote by $\mathcal{F}^\mathbb{P}$ the family of all subsets of $\Omega$ of the form $A \cup C$ where $A \in \mathcal{F}$ and $C$ is a null set. The collection $\mathcal{F}^\mathbb{P}$ is called the completion of $\mathcal{F}$ with respect to $\mathbb{P}$ . The probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ is called complete if $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}^\mathbb{P}$ . Firstly, I am struggling to get to grips with this definition, as it is so heavy on notation/ maths, but moreover, what is the relevance of completion of a sigma algebra or a probability space?

4095456,Maximal ideal with given condition,"I am reading the proof by B. Banaschewski of ""Krull implies Zorn."" I am having difficulties filling in the details in one of the steps.

Let $\mathfrak S$ be the set of all spreads. We consider the ring $R=\mathbb Q[E]$ of polynomials with elements of $E$ as indeterminates. Set $T=\bigcup_{X\in\mathfrak S}\langle X\rangle_R$ and $U=R-T$ , where $\langle X\rangle_R$ denotes the smallest ideal in $R$ containing $X$ . One may prove that $U$ is closed under multiplication.

As an example, he mentions that the familiar Galois connection between intermediate fields of $L/K$ and subgroups of $Gal(L/K)$ , for some fixed Galois extension $L/K$ , can be ""globalized"" to an adjunction between the opposite category of the category of $k$ -algebras and the category of topological $Gal(\overline{k}/k)$ -sets. Question: In which sense can the Galois connection be considered as a ""fragment"" of the adjunction? Lawvere writes Restricting to subalgebras of $\overline{k}$ on the one hand
and to quotients of the regular representation on the other retrieves in effect the usual
Galois connection. but I don't understand this and how this ""retrieves in effect the usual
Galois connection"". Another example he mentions is that the Galois connection between ideals in $k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ and varieties can be ""globalized"" to the adjunction between $k$ -algebras and schemes (given by ""spectrum"" and ""global section"").

It  is very easy to see that $$y' = C_1 e^{-(\log x)^s},$$ which cannot be integrated in closed form, as far as I know. What I am interested in is finding how $y$ behaves as $x \rightarrow \infty$ , that is, it's asymptotic behaviour. A first idea would be to write the integrand as a series in $(\log x )^s$ and integrate term by term, but that doesn't really help since as $x$ is arbitrarily large, every term is larger than the previous one (in absolute terms), and so it doesn't make sense to terminate the series somewhere. How can I do that in this case? EDIT: One idea might be to make the ansatz $$y(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty y_n(x) s^n,$$ and solve for the $y_n(x)$ term by term. The zeroth order term is $$y_0(x) = C_1 e^{-d} x+C_2,$$ while the first order term is $$y_1(x) = C_1 d e^{-d} \int^x \log (\log u) du.$$ In general, it is easy to see that $$y_n(x) \propto \int^x[ \log (\log u)]^n du.$$ If we are able to compute the limit of the ratio $$ \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{y_{n+1}(x)}{y_n(x)} \propto \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}\frac{\int^x[ \log (\log u)]^{n+1} du
}{\int^x[ \log (\log u)]^n du}
$$ and show that it vanishes (I don't know what it is equal to, but it'd be lovely if it vanished ), then indeed we have the asymptotic behaviour. If it diverges, then we haven't made much progress. I think it probably diverges, given that it is easy to see that the limit is $$ \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{y'_{n+1}(x)}{y'_n(x)} \propto \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}\frac{[ \log (\log x)]^{n+1}
}{[ \log (\log x)]^n}=\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \log (\log x) = \infty.
$$ This of course assumes that the original limit is indeterminate which is likely but not known yet. NOTE: I set all integration constants for the terms $y_n(x)$ with $n \geq 1$ equal to zero, and keep them only for the zeroth term.","['integration', 'asymptotics', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

\text{perm}(\sigma(M)) &= \text{perm}(M),

The simplest proof might be to find a ""counter-example"".  I mean, it is enough to show that $\sqrt 2=\dfrac{f(2)}{g(2)}$ is irrational. I found the argument based on this argument I said in M.SE. Suppose there exists $\alpha\in\mathbb{Q}(x)$ such that $|\alpha(x)|=\sqrt{x}$ for all $x\in\mathbb{Q}$ with $x\ge 0$ . Then in particular, we have $|\alpha(2)|=\sqrt{2}$ , contradiction, since $\alpha(2)$ can't be irrational. The argument that one of the functions $f^2(x)$ and $xg^2(x)$ has a even degree and the other has a odd degree is also valid. Now I want to know whether these two proofs that I have made are valid too. Let, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials, such that $$\sqrt x=\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \Longrightarrow x=\frac{f^2(x)}{g^2(x)}$$ Then, $$\deg \left (f^2(x)-g^2(x)\right)=\deg x=1$$ $$2 \deg \left (f(x)-g(x)\right)=1$$ $$\deg \left (f(x)-g(x)\right)=\frac 12 \not\in\mathbb Z^{+}$$ Thus, we can deduce such $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ doesn't exist. By accepting $$\sqrt x=\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$$ $$\deg f(x)=m ~~\text{and}~~ \deg g(x)=n, $$ $$m,n\in\mathbb Z^{+}∪\left\{0\right\}$$ Then, $$\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\infty \implies m-n≥1$$ Then let $x≠0$ , we have $$\frac{\sqrt x}{x}=\frac{f(x)}{xg(x)}$$ $$\frac{1}{\sqrt x}=\frac{f(x)}{xg(x)}$$ $$\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{f(x)}{xg(x)}=0 \implies n+1-m≥1$$ Finally we have, $$\begin{cases} m-n≥1\\ n+1-m≥1 \end{cases} \implies \begin{cases} m-n≥1 \\m-n≤0\end{cases} $$ $$\implies \left\{m,n\right\}\in \emptyset.$$ Are there any points / steps I missed?

4096677,Finding the units of $\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}\right]$,"I was trying to comprehend a simple exercise from my elementary number theory class.

The official solution:
If $z=a+b \theta$ is a unit of $\mathbb{Z}[\theta]$ then $z \bar{z}=1$ , so we have $a^{2}+a b+5 b^{2}=1$ from which we conclude $a=\pm 1$ , so the units are $\pm 1$ . If $z=a+b \theta$ is a nonunit, non-associate divisor of 2 then $z \bar{z}=2$ , but there are no solutions to $a^{2}+a b+5 b^{2}=2$ . The arguments for 3 and $\theta$ are similar. This solution is much too concise for me. Firstly, why does $z=a+b \theta$ being a unit of $\mathbb{Z}[\theta]$ imply $z \bar{z}=1$ ? At this point in time, the norm for $\mathbb{Z}[\theta]$ has not been defined, so cannot be used. I was hypothesizing that for $z_1,z_2 \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]$ , $z_1 z_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ implied (by comparing imaginary parts) that $z_1 = \lambda \overline{z_2}$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{Q}$ , but this also is not easy to prove. I even failed to brute force this, I couldn't continue the calculation. Why does $z=a+b \theta$ being a nonunit, non-associate divisor of 2 imply that $z \bar{z}=2$ ?

A consequence of this is that all the information about the $\operatorname{spin}^c$ structure can be recover from its characteristic line bundle iff there is no 2-torsion in the second integral cohomology group. However, in Exercise 5.9 he asks to prove that two $\operatorname{spin}^c$ structures are isomorphic iff the two characteristic line bundles are isomorphic.
This seems to be in contradiction with the previous statement about the torsion because if there is a 2-torsion element in the second cohomology group then it is possible to create non isomorphic $\operatorname{spin}^c$ structures (using the twisted $\operatorname{spin}^c$ structure associated to the torsion element) with isomorphic characteristic line bundles.

4096812,Topology axioms in terms of net convergence,"I am looking for the list of axioms of ""net convergence"" in the language of nets which correspond to the axioms of a topology. (Notice that neither Wikipedia nor nlab seem  to answer this question.) Specifically: Let $X$ be a set. A net in $X$ is defined as a function $P \to X$ from a directed partial order $P$ to $X$ . Let $\to$ be a relation from nets in $X$ to elements of $X$ , thought of as net convergence. Now let us call $A \subseteq X$ closed if it is closed under net convergence: $$(x_p)_{p\in P} \to x ~ \wedge~ \forall p \in P (x_p \in A) \implies x \in A.$$ Question. What are axioms for $\to$ which guarantee that this is a topology on $X$ such that the notion of net convergence from the topology is exaclty $\to$ ? If I am not mistaken, we just need that $\to$ is compatible with subnets: A subnet of $P \to X$ is a composition $Q \to P \to X$ for some cofinal map of partial orders $Q \to P$ . We need to require that if a net converges to some element, then every subnet convergences to that element as well. Then all the axioms of a topology are satisfied: $\emptyset$ is closed since there is no net with values in $\emptyset$ (remember that directed sets are non-empty by definition). The intersection of closed subsets is closed for trivial reasons. Now if $ A,B$ are closed and a net $(x_p)_{p \in P}$ with entries in $A \cup B$ converges to some element $x \in X \setminus A$ , then it has a subnet with entries in $B$ , thus $x \in B$ . This means that we just need one axiom, which is a bit weird. What I am missing? In particular, I don't see directly how to deduce that a constant net $(x)_{p \in P}$ converges to $x$ . I would appreciate references to the literature. It seems to be a very basic question. But when I look for these kind of characterizations, the texts seem to focus on filters instead. Answer. The question is answered by Theorem 9 on p. 74 in Kelley's book General topology . Thanks Chris Custer for pointing this out.","['general-topology', 'nets', 'reference-request']"

Let the blue vertex above have coordinates $(a,\frac12)$ , which with $D_7$ symmetry determines the rest of the graph. $a$ must satisfy the following sextic over $\mathbb Q[t]$ : $$256 a^{6} + a^{5} \left(16 t^{5} - 320 t^{3} + 304 t\right) + a^{4} \left(- 16 t^{2} - 144\right) + a^{3} \left(- 32 t^{5} + 656 t^{3} - 912 t\right) + a^{2} \left(- 4 t^{4} + 112 t^{2} - 188\right) + a \left(7 t^{5} - 136 t^{3} + 57 t\right) - t^{4} + 13 t^{2} + 14=0\tag1$$ where $t=\tan\frac\pi7$ .

4096986,"$\int_0^\infty \log\left(1 - \frac{x}{\sinh x}\right)\,dx$ and generalisations","I'm interested in the value of $$
\theta(2) := -\frac{1}{2\pi^2}\int_0^\infty \log\left(1 - \frac{x}{\sinh x}\right)\,dx.
$$ I have some hopes this admits a closed-form solution. Expanding the logarithm yields the integral $I_n := \int_0^\infty(\frac{x}{\sinh x})^n\,dx$ , which has recently been asked about here on math.sa . More generally, I'd love to know a closed-form solution for $$\theta(\ell) := -\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^\infty \log\left(1 - \left\lvert \frac{\Gamma(\frac{\ell}{2}+ix)}{\Gamma(\frac{\ell}{2})}\right\rvert^2\right)\,dx$$ with $\ell\in\mathbb{N}$ . For $\ell=2$ this is the same integral as above; see below for details. The integral $\theta(\ell)$ has some relation to the eigenvalues of truncated random orthogonal matrices; see this paper , especially equation (7.1). Some partial results below. For $\ell=1$ , the integral $\theta(1)$ is solvable by expanding the $\log$ and its value is $$\theta(1) = \frac{3}{16}.$$ Note that for $b\in\mathbb{R}$ , $$
\left|\Gamma\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+bi\right)\right|^2  = \frac{\pi}{\cosh \pi b}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\left|\Gamma\left(1+bi\right)\right|^2 = \frac{\pi b}{\sinh \pi b},
$$ or more generally for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , $$\begin{align}
\left|\Gamma\left(1+n+bi\right)\right|^2 & = \frac{\pi b}{\sinh \pi b} \prod_{k=1}^n \left(k^2 + b^2 \right)\\
\left|\Gamma\left(\tfrac{1}{2} + n+bi\right)\right|^2 & = \frac{\pi}{\cosh \pi b} \prod_{k=1}^n \left(\left( k-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^2 + b^2 \right)
\end{align}$$ (for a derivation, see Wikipedia ). Hence, when expanding the $\log$ the integral turns into the sum of the integral of powers of $\frac{1}{\sinh}$ and $\frac{1}{\cosh}$ times a polynomial. For instance for $\ell=2$ , one has $$2\pi^2\theta(2) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}\int_0^\infty \Bigl(\frac{x}{\sinh x}\Bigr)^n\,dx.$$ The integral $I_n := \int_0^\infty(\frac{x}{\sinh x})^n\,dx$ has recently been asked about here on math.sa . The answers prove a recurrence relation and indicate that $I_n$ is a linear combination of $\zeta(2), \zeta(4), \ldots, \zeta(2⌈n/2⌉)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ , where the coefficients are the ""central factorial numbers"", see this answer . (The central factorial numbers (OEIS A008955 and A008956 ) turn out to also show up in the power series expansion of $x\mapsto(\frac{x}{\sinh x})^n$ , $x\mapsto(\arcsin x)^n$ and powers of various other trigonometric functions; see this paper for a thorough treatment.) I'd be interested to know if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}I_n$ admits a more succinct representation. For larger values of $\ell$ , the expansion produces terms of the form $\int_0^\infty x^n(\frac{1}{\sinh x})^m \, dx$ and $\int_0^\infty x^n(\frac{1}{\cosh x})^m \, dx$ . In the question mentioned before , user Quanto has given a recurrence relation for such integrals. The polynomials in question make it likely central factorial numbers play a role in the linear combinations there too.","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'hyperbolic-functions', 'gamma-function', 'sequences-and-series']"
4096988,Can all triangles containing integer angles (in degrees) be solved by synthetic solutions (elementary geometry)?,"I had recently asked a question about a conjecture in a triangle , and it led me to another question. In the non-equilateral triangle below, $CD, AD$ , and $BD$ concur at point $D$ . The angles $(a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f)$ in degrees are also
placed as given in the figure below. Define a solvable triangle such that:  For a triangle like the
one in the figure above, given two pairs of adjacent angles (say $a,b$ and $c,d$ ), if the
remaining two angles (say $e,f$ ) can be found by a synthetic solution using elementary geometry, it is
a solvable triangle. (Just to be clear, I have added an example at the end.) My questions are : Are all triangles containing integer angled sextuplets solvable triangles? What is the criterion for being a solvable triangle? Such a sextuplet must satisfy the Trigonometric Ceva's Theorem: $$\frac{\sin(a\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}{\sin(b\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}\cdot\frac{\sin(c\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}{\sin(d\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}\cdot\frac{\sin(e\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}{\sin(f\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}= 1$$ We also know that, $$a+b+c+d+e+f=180°$$ In the comments of their accepted answer to my previous question, @user provided a sextuplet $\frac\pi{180}\{1,30,87,2,29,31\}$ with different integers to work on -I am also sure that there more such sextuplets which consist of different integers. Here is an example problem using this sextuplet (there are more such triangles that can be formed with this sextuplet): Let $\measuredangle ACD=31°$ , $\measuredangle BCD=30°$ , $\measuredangle CAD=1°$ , $\measuredangle BAD=2°$ in $\bigtriangleup
ABC$ . Find $\color{green}{\text {$\measuredangle ABD$}}$ . Example Synthetic Solution: Since the angles are extremely small, I have reproduced the diagram by rescaling the angles (blue line segments represent the original problem and red line segments represent my constructions). Let’s select a point $E$ on $AD$ such that $AE=CE$ and connect $E$ and $C$ , so $\measuredangle ECA=1°$ . Let’s extend $BC$ and select a point $F$ on $BC$ such that $CE=CF$ , constructing the equilateral triangle $\bigtriangleup CEF$ . Angle chasing leads us to: $$\measuredangle DEC=2° \; \text{and} \; \measuredangle DEF=58°$$ Let’s connect points $F$ and $D$ . Since $CD$ is the angle bisector of the equilateral triangle $\bigtriangleup CEF$ , using congruency: $$\measuredangle DFB=2° \; \text{and} \; \measuredangle DFE=58°$$ Since $\bigtriangleup AEF$ is isosceles, $\measuredangle AFE=29°$ . Since $\measuredangle DFB=\measuredangle BAD=2°$ , $AFBD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, which allows us to conclude that: $$\color{green}{\text {$\measuredangle AFD=\measuredangle ABD=87°$}}$$ I think the $30°$ angle is the critical angle that allowed this solution. $\\$ The synthetic solution seems to be difficult when $a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f$ are all different integers .

4096995,Meaning of integral identity containing cross product with the area differential,"Edit: I just noticed that the exercise itself was asked here. However I'm not asking for a proof, but about the meaning/intuition behind the notation / exercise itself. On a Multivariable Calculus problem sheet I was asked to prove the following integral identity: Problem . Let $f$ be a smooth scalar field defined on a region $R \subseteq \mathbb{R^3}$ with a smooth boundary $\partial R$ . Show that $$\iint_{\partial R} f \mathbf{r} \wedge \text{d} \mathbf{S} = \iiint_R \mathbf{r} \wedge \nabla f \, \text{d}V$$ I did manage to solve the problem by using the fact that d $\mathbf{S}$ = $\mathbf{n}$ dS, where $\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing normal to $\partial R$ at $\mathbf{r}$ and by applying the divergence theorem on a well-chosen vector field (I won't go into details in case this problem appears on a problem sheet in the future.) I have two questions about this problem: 1) Is there some sort of meaning behind taking a cross product with the area differential, or is it in this case just a shorthand notation for $\mathbf{r} \wedge \mathbf{n}$ dS? I was very confused when I first saw it, and it seems like it's not really necessary, but why would they choose this notation if it doesn't really mean anything special? 2) Is there any kind of (perhaps physical or otherwise) interpretation of this integral identity, or is it just the result of some arbitrary calculation?

4096999,"Counterexample to ""kernel determines image""","Working over a base field, there is a typical homomorphism theorem for affine algebraic groups ensuring that any two homomporphisms $G \to H_1$ , $G \to H_2$ with the same kernel in $G$ have isomorphic images. Proving this makes heavily use of the nontrivial fact that injective homomorphisms between Hopf algebras over fields are faithfully flat. Working over general base rings (which are not fields), it is easy to find non-faithfully flat injective Hopf algebra homomorphisms: For example over the base ring of integers, $\mathbb{Z}[X] \to \mathbb{Z}[X]$ sending $X$ to $nX$ for any $n \not\in \{0,1,-1\}$ is not faithfully flat. (It corresponds to the multiplication-by- $n$ -homomorphism $\mathbb{G}_a \to \mathbb{G}_a$ .) I suspect the above statement fails in this general setting, but I cound not find any counterexample so far. Question 1: Are there homomorphisms $f_1 \colon G \to H_1$ , $f_2 \colon G \to H_2$ of affine algebraic groups with the same kernel such that $\mathrm{Im}(f_1)$ is not isomorphic to $\mathrm{Im}(f_2)$ ? More specifically: Question 2: Is there an injective homomorphism $f \colon G \to H$ of affine algebraic groups such that $\mathrm{Im}(f)$ is not isomorphic to $G$ ? Edit 1 Here is an attempt to find a counterexample to question 2. My idea is to adapt known homomorphisms of algebraic groups which can be defined over general base rings but show different behavior after base extensions to fields of different characteristics. For any base ring $R$ there is the circle group $C$ defined for any $R$ -algebra $A$ by $$ C(A) = \{ (x,y) \in A^2 : x^2+y^2 = 1 \}. $$ The identity element is $(1,0)$ , and the group operations are given by $$ (x_1,y_1) \cdot (x_2,y_2) = (x_1x_2 - y_1y_2, x_1y_2+ x_2y_1), \text{ and } (x,y)^{-1} = (x,-y). $$ If $R$ has an element $i \in R$ with $i^2 = -1$ , there is a homomorphism $$ \varphi \colon C \to \mathbb{G}_m, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x+iy.$$ This morphism is quite exiting: If $2$ is invertible in $R$ then $\varphi$ is already an isomorphism. If $2$ not not invertible however, then $\varphi$ is not injective, and we can extend $R$ to a field of characteristics 2, where $\varphi$ is neither injective nor surjective (it maps onto $\mu_2$ then). This example can be found in [Waterhouse, Introduction to affine group schemes, chapter 1, exercise 11]. Since $\varphi$ has nontrivial kernel, it cannot be a counterexample to (2). So let's add an additional equation: Let $C'$ be the subgroup of the circle group given by $$ C'(A) = \{ (x,y) \in A^2 : x^2+y^2=1, 3y=0 \}. $$ Now the restriction of $\varphi$ to $C'$ has trivial kernel, but it is not surjective anymore - we have to add at least one additional equation $3t^2=3$ to $\mathbb{G}_m$ . That is, $\varphi$ induces a homomorphism of algebraic subgroups $$ \{ (x,y) : x^2+y^2=1, 3y = 0 \} \to \{ t : t \text{ invertible}, 3t^2=3 \}. $$ I think this might be a counterexample to (2) since it becomes an isomorphism after extending the base ring to any field, but I cannot see how it should be an isomorphism over (say) the Gaussian integers $R = \mathbb{Z}[i]$ . However, I also cannot see at the moment why it should be (scheme-theoretically) surjective. To restate the question in terms of Hopf algebras: There is a homomorphism $$ (\mathbb{Z}[i])[T,T^{-1}]/(3(T^2-1)) \to (\mathbb{Z}[i])[X,Y]/(X^2+Y^2-1, 3Y), \quad T \mapsto X+iY. $$ Is this morphism injective but not surjective? (Of course (2) asks for a little bit more: Is the left hand side not ismomorphic to the right hand side?) Edit 2 Unfortunately, this specific morphism is already an isomorphism which can be easily seen by condiering the localizations of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ at all primes $\mathfrak{p}$ . For all primes with $3 \notin \mathfrak{p}$ it is quite obvious that the morphism is basically the same as the identity map $\mu_2 \to \mu_2$ , since $3$ is invertible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]_\mathfrak{p}$ . On the other hand, if $3 \in \mathfrak{p}$ then $2$ is invertible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]_\mathfrak{p}$ . In this case, $\varphi \colon C \to \mathbb{G}_m$ is an isomorphism, and it can be easily checked that its inverse maps $\{ t : t \text{ invertible }, 3t^2=3 \}$ to $C'$ . In order to get a counterexample in the way sketched above, we have to choose some other equation (instead of $3y=0$ ) which nontrivially affects the groups over the base ring $\mathbb{Z}[i]_\mathfrak{p}$ for $\mathfrak{p} = (1+i)$ .","['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-groups', 'hopf-algebras']"

Now, if I am to evaluate every multivariate polynomial for every pixel in a high resolution image, it will require lots of computations.

In other words, can I find a square or a circle where I can decide that outside of this there will be no values $=0$ or $\leq 0$ ? for example $$x^4+y^4 - 2^4 = 0$$ will be a shape limited by a square centered on origo with side $4$ .

Since I am not able to see a small dense subcategory of $\mathbf{Top}$ , the category of topological spaces and continuous maps, I assume that there is none (in contrast to nice subcategories such as the subcategory of CW-complexes). Why does $\mathbf{Top}$ not have a small dense subcategory? Perhaps one can derive a contradiction why using ordinal numbers (equipped with the order topology)? Another path would be to use that every cocomplete category with a small dense subcategory actually satisfies a very strong adjoint functor theorem: every cocontinuous functor on it is a left adjoint. So it suffices to construct a cocontinuous functor on $\mathbf{Top}$ which is no left adjoint. Maybe we can even prove something stronger? Recall that $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{A}$ is colimit-dense when every object $A \in \mathcal{A}$ has a diagram in $\mathcal{B}$ whose colimit in $\mathcal{A}$ is $A$ .

4097367,The rank of the Jacobian of an algebraic curve,"Suppose $C \subset \mathbb{A}^n$ is an algebraic curve, with $C = V(I)$ where $I = \langle f_1,...,f_r\rangle\subset \mathbb{C}[x_1,...,x_n]$ is an ideal. Let $J$ be the Jacobian matrix where $J_{i,j} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}$ . Why is it necessarily true that $\operatorname{Rank}(J) \leq n-1$ ? What I know: Since $C$ is an algebraic curve, I know that $I$ is generated by at least $(n-1)$ polynomials, so the maximum possible rank of $J$ is $n$ , which could potentially happen if $I$ is generated by $n$ polynomials and all of the rows of the Jacobian are linearly independent over $\mathbb{C}$ . Therefore, I imagine the goal is to show that this is actually impossible, say by contradicting the fact that $C$ is a curve. What I have tried: I know that one can change the generators of an ideal and will find that the rank of the Jacobian arising from each of these sets of generators will be the same at each point. So I hoped that one could try to find a Gröbner basis for $I$ which would only have $(n-1)$ generators, making the question trivial. However, I am not very familiar with Gröbner bases, I only know that in some sense they're ""the best you can do"" when it comes to finding generators for an ideal, so I have not been able to make much progress along this route. A second approach : As mentioned above, taking $I$ and $J_{i,j}$ as previously defined, the greatest possible rank of $J$ is $n$ , we want to show that this is in fact impossible. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\operatorname{rank}(J|_p) = n$ at some point $p$ , then there is some $n \times n$ submatrix of $J|_p$ which is of full rank, and is hence invertible. Therefore there is some sequence of row operations which transforms the matrix $J|_p$ into the form $$\begin{pmatrix} 
I_{n\times n}\\
0_{n \times (r-n)}
\end{pmatrix}$$ From here I am unsure how to progress, but I'll present some logic here. The row operations performed on $J$ correspond to similar operations on the generators $f_1,..,f_r$ of $I$ . Being able to bring $J$ into the above form therefore corresponds to being able to map $f_1$ to some function $g_1$ where $\frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_1}(p) = 1$ while $\frac{\partial g_1}{\partial x_i}(p) = 0$ for $i\neq 1$ and similarly for the other functions. I would like to be able to conclude from this that my new generators give an ideal which define a zero dimensional variety, but I am unsure how to progress from this point. My first intuition is that the restriction above meant that $g_1 = x_1$ , $g_2=x_2$ and so on, but there are numerous counter examples to this claim. Is there a suitable way to proceed from one of the methods outlined here, or am I making this more complicated than it needs to be?","['algebraic-curves', 'jacobian', 'algebraic-geometry']"

I've been trying to prove this, but I haven't had much luck. Below is the work I have done. I'll firstly write out a bunch of terms of the series. $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{F_kF_{k+1}}=\frac{1}{F_{1}F_{2}}-\frac{1}{F_{2}F_{3}}+\frac{1}{F_{3}F_{4}}-\frac{1}{F_{4}F_{5}}+\frac{1}{F_{5}F_{6}}-\frac{1}{F_{6}F_{7}}+\cdots$$ It therefore follows that $$\begin{align}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{F_kF_{k+1}}&=\frac{1}{F_2}\left(\frac{1}{F_1}-\frac{1}{F_3}\right)+\frac{1}{F_4}\left(\frac{1}{F_3}-\frac{1}{F_5}\right)+\cdots\\
&=\frac{1}{F_1F_3}+\frac{1}{F_3F_5}+\cdots\\
&=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{F_{2k-1}F_{2k+1}}\tag{1}\end{align}$$ Similarly, $$\begin{align}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{F_kF_{k+1}}&=\frac{1}{F_1F_2}-\frac{1}{F_3}\left(\frac{1}{F_2}-\frac{1}{F_4}\right)-\frac{1}{F_5}\left(\frac{1}{F_4}-\frac{1}{F_6}\right)-\cdots\\
&=1-\frac{1}{F_2F_4}-\frac{1}{F_4F_6}-\cdots\\
&=1-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{F_{2k}F_{2k+2}}\tag{2}\end{align}$$ Unfortunately I haven't had any luck in evaluating these. I did think of using Cassini's identity , which yielded the following when applied to $(1)$ and $(2)$ respectively: $$\begin{align}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{F_kF_{k+1}}&=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1+F_{2k}^2}\tag{3}\\
&=1-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{F_{2k+1}^2-1}\tag{4}\end{align}$$ But once more I could not see a way of evaluating these series either. Usually with summations involving Fibonacci numbers forming a telescoping series is effective, but I couldn't succeed in making this one telescope. Thank you for your help, it is really appreciated.

4097410,Finding inertia degree and ramification index over local fields,"I am working with the splitting field $L/\mathbb{Q}_2$ of the polynomial $$
h=x^4-2x^2+4\in\mathbb{Q}_2[x]
$$ and want to find the inertia degree and ramification index of $L$ . Let $w$ be the unique extension of the $p$ -adic valuation to $L$ . Using the discriminant and resolvent cubic, I found that the Galois group of $h$ is the Klein four-group $C_2\times C_2$ , and by considering the Newton polygon, it is $w(\alpha)=1/2$ for any root $\alpha$ of $h$ . This means that the ramification index $e$ is at least $2$ and thus for the inertia degree it is $f\leq 4/e=2$ . Additionally, the inertia group $I$ is nontrivial, because $L/K$ is ramified. There is a canonical isomorphism $G/I\to \mathrm{Gal}\left(\lambda/\mathbb{F}_2\right)$ and hence $$
|G|/|I|=\left|\mathrm{Gal}\left(\lambda/\mathbb{F}_2\right)\right|=\left[\lambda:\mathbb{F}_2\right]=f.
$$ I also know that $\left(|I|/|R|,2\right)=1$ for the ramification group $R\subset I$ and thus $|I|=|R|$ . Here I used that we have an injection $I/R\hookrightarrow \lambda^*$ . Furthermore, because of the injections $G_k/G_{k+1}\hookrightarrow\lambda,~k\geq 1$ the factor groups $G_k/G_{k+1}$ are abelian and have order a power of $2$ . However, with all this information I still couldn't determine whether $I=C_2\times C_2$ or $I=C_2$ . In Ramification in local fields it is suggested to look at the reduction $h\equiv x^4\mod 2$ , which doesn't help either (or I don't see how it would). This is the case for any polynomial whose Newton polygon has nonzero slope, which I encounter multiple times. Is there a way to determine the inertia group $I$ with the information I provided, or is there a different/better way? I mostly worked with Chapter 2 of Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory. In the local fields database https://math.la.asu.edu/~jj/localfields/ we can see that for the polynomial $h$ it is $e=f=2$ . Also, for the polynomial $$
h_2=x^4+3x^2+1\in\mathbb{Q}_2[x]
$$ we have $$
h_2\equiv x^4+x^2+1 \equiv \left(x^2+x+1\right)^2 \mod 2.
$$ From how I understood the comments in Ramification in local fields , this already implies $e=f=2$ for the stem field of $h_2$ . Is this correct?
If it is correct, could you please suggest a source where I can find the involved results? Thank you very much for your help!","['galois-theory', 'number-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

But if we used a different projection for the diagram (i.e. a different metric for distance) then it wouldn't necessarily. Of course, complex numbers can also be written as: $$z = re^{i\theta} = r(\cos\theta +i\sin\theta)$$ so an equivalent question could be, if this is what we define, why we define that: $$|e^{i\theta}| = |\cos\theta + i\sin\theta| = 1$$ for all values of $\theta$ , rather than just $\theta = n\pi$ .

long enough horizontal metal shaft and exactly one weight of each radii $1, 2,\dots, 100$ units. They
take turns alternatively, starting with Amo, picking up a weight and inserting it from either left
of right head of the shaft. After all weights have been inserted, Matin stands by the left side of
the shaft and Amo stands by its right; among them the one who can see more weights wins; if
they see equal number of weight then it is a draw. By seeing a weight we mean that no weight
with bigger radius exist between the observer and that weight. Considering that they both are
intelligent mathematicians, determine the result of this game. Here are my results: Matin has a draw strategy: If Amo starts with inserting the weight with radius 100,
Matin inserts 99 from his end, after this move Matin just needs to insert the largest weight from his
end; in this manner any weight inserted by him will be visible by him and not Amo. So Matin
will see 51 weights and Amo will see 50 weights. But if Amo start with a weight with radius
less than 100 Matin puts the weight with radius 100 at Amo's end and continues like the other
case. Playing 99 when 100 is not played yet will cause the rival to have a draw strategy: This is actually quiet easy the rival will insert 100 from not his but the other end of shaft. The rest is similar to the above when 100 is inserted. Playing 98 before 99 and 100 will cause the rival to have a draw strategy: Again the other player does the same as above it is not hard to see it works.","['game-theory', 'combinatorics', 'combinatorial-game-theory']"

4097606,Understanding short exact sequences,"I'm trying to understand the presentation on short exact sequences in Benedict Gross's algebra lecture, but I'm having difficulty. This is the definition he gives (paraphrased): Given $G,H,G'$ groups, consider $$1 \to H \to G \to G' \to 1,$$ and let $g: H \to G$ and $f: G \to G'$ be homomorphisms, where $g$ is one-to-one, $f$ is onto, and $g(H) = $ the kernel of $f$ . Defining the maps in this way is fine. If $g$ is one-to-one, it is injective so it's kernel is trivial. The statement $g(H) = \mathrm{ker(f)}$ doesn't make complete sense to me. If $g$ is injective its kernel is trivial, and $g$ has to map identity to identity because it's a homomorphism, so it has to map the kernel in $g$ into the kernel in $H$ . If $g$ is injective, does not that not imply that $H$ is the trivial subgroup? Another reading of this (based on some lecture notes) states instead $\mathrm{Im}(g) = \mathrm{ker}(f)$ . Is this the correct notion? Is there an interplay between injectivity of $f$ , surjectivity of $f$ , and this fact? Finally, he concludes that by $G \cong G/H$ by the first isomorphism theorem. This would require that $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ (though it's possible this was embedded in the assumptions). $f: G \to G'$ is surjective by assumption, so we have $G/\mathrm{ker}(f) \cong \mathrm{im}(f)$ by the first isomorphism theorem. So this would require that $H = \mathrm{ker}(f)$ (I suppose this is where the above assumption comes into play). I'm also a little bit confused about the "" $1$ 's"": this is strange notation to me, and I'd be inclined to write $\{e\}$ . But are they different identities?

\end{align*} If $p$ is a real number $\geq 2$ , it can be easily checked by showing that the ratio of L.H.S and R.H.S tends to $1$ . However, this is not the type of proof I wished for. I'm seeking for a more elegant proof, that would also work for the case in which $p$ is a complex number. For example, is there any way to find the analytical continuation of it? Also, is there any reference for this equality? I believe there are more of this kind in the literature.","['complex-analysis', 'reference-request', 'sequences-and-series']"
4097825,"Is it ""obvious"" that nested commutators generate the derived series?","The derived series of a group is constructed iteratively, taking repeated commutator subgroups. A commutator subgroup is famously not only the set of commutators but the group they generate. This raises the question of whether the second derived group is generated by commutators of commutators, as opposed to commutators of products of commutators. And so on iteratively. Now the identity $$[x, zy] = [x, y] [x, z] [[x, z], y]$$ implies that commutators of products can be expressed as products of commutators. Unless I'm mistaken, a little thought now allows one to infer that you can move all products to the outermost level of commutator brackets, and conclude that in fact the $n$ th derived group is generated by $n$ th nested commutators. But I find this argument a little messy and unsatisfying. Is there a nicer argument - and preferably an intuitive one, rather than one relying on non-obvious theorems? Thanks!","['derived-subgroup', 'group-theory']"
