73760,Does Zorn Lemma imply the existence of a (not unique) maximal prolongation of any solution of an ode?,"Let be given a map $F:(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^n\to F(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Let us denote by $\mathcal{P}$ the set whose elements are the solutions of the ode $y'=F(x,y)$, i.e. the differentiable maps $u:J\to\mathbb{R}^n$, where $J\ $ is some open interval in $\mathbb{R}\ $, s.t. $u'(t)=F(t,u(t))$ for all $t\in J$. Let $\mathcal{P}$ be endowed with the ordering by extension. In order to prove that any element of $\mathcal{P}$ is extendable to a (not unique) maximal element, without particular hypothesis on $F$, I was wondering if the Zorn lemma can be used.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'axiom-of-choice']"

In looking at this list of prime factorizations, I see that all of the first 10 prime numbers, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, appear within the factorizations of only seven consecutive integers.  (The next prime number, 31, has its multiples as far from 1100 as it could hope to get them (1085 and 1116).)  So no nearby number could hope to be divisible by 29 or 23, nor even by 7 for suitably adjusted values of ""nearby"".  Consequently when you're factoring nearby numbers, you're deprived of those small primes as potential factors by which they might be divisible.  So nearby numbers, for lack of small primes that could divide them, must be divisible by large primes.  And accordingly, not far away, we find $1099=7\times157$ (157 doesn't show up so often---only once every 157 steps---that you'd usually expect to find it so close by) and likewise 1098 is divisible by 61, 1108 by 277, 1096 by 137, 1095 by 73, 1094 by 547, etc.; and 1097 and 1109 are themselves prime. So if an unusually large number of small primes occur unusually close together as factors, then an unusually large number of large primes must also be in the neighborhood. Are there known precise results quantifying this phenomenon?","['prime-numbers', 'analytic-number-theory', 'reference-request', 'number-theory']"

73825,Putting Geometries on Knot Complements,"I have two different, but related, questions about the type of geometry one can get on a knot complement. Quickly some notation: $K$ will be a non-trivial smooth knot - living in $S^3$ - and $M$ will be the complement of a regular neighborhood of $K$. QUESTION 1 How can $M$ ever admit a hyperbolic geometry (as in, how can hyperbolic knots exist)? $\pi_1(M)$ will contain a $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ subgroup (coming from the boundary of that regular neighborhood), and so $\pi_1(M)$ cannot be a hyperbolic group. Most likely I am confusing details about hyperbolic structures and having a hyperbolic fundamental group. QUESTION 2 This time let $K$ be the trefoil knot.  A reliable source (who almost surely knows what he's talking about) told me, in this case, $M$ admits an $\widetilde{SL(2,\mathbb{R})}$ geometry. [I don't understand all the details of how he explained it, but I think it boiled down to viewing $M$ as $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, quotient the action of the discrete group $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$]. But wait! It is well-known in this case that $\pi_1(M)\cong B_3$, the braid group on $3$ strands. And $B_3$ has a subgroup of index $6$ which looks like $\mathbb{Z}\times F_2$, where $F_2$ is the free group on $2$ generators.  This subgroup corresponds to a six-sheeted covering space $\hat{M}$; we also have $\hat{M}\sim N\times S^1$, with $N$ a compact surface and $\pi_1(N)\cong F_2$. Now this means $\hat{M}$ has an $\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ geometry, and so $M$ must as well. [In fact, the underlying ideas here work for any torus knot.] So what exactly went wrong?","['geometric-topology', 'low-dimensional-topology', 'group-theory']"
73837,Need for triangle congruency axioms,"I'm going through a text, Elementary Geometry from an Advanced Standpoint , by Edwin E. Moise that gives an axiomatic development of geometry. In the first few chapters, the author covers incidence axioms for points, lines, and planes; a ruler postulate for line-segment measure; betweenness for points on a line; a plane separation axiom for dividing planes into two convex half planes; angle measure postulates. (Granted, this is a rough outline of the axioms, rather than an explicit list.) The author then presents standard axioms for congruency of triangles, such as the side-angle-side postulate---if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding parts of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent. My question is whether this triangle congruency axiom follows from the axioms listed above, or whether it's independent from them. For instance, if the law of cosines follows from the above axioms, then the triangle congruency axioms should not be necessary. On the other hand, it is hard to imagine geometric models of the axioms listed above in which the triangle congruency axioms fail. So, does it seem more likely that such models really exist or that you can prove the side-angle-side axiom?",['geometry']

73863,Weak convergences of measurable functions and of measures,"My question is ""how weak convergences of measurable functions is defined?""
There seems to be two different definitions which are both based on weak convergence of measures generated by the measurable functions, but differ in how the measurable functions generate their new measures. In terms of the new measure $\nu(A):=\int_A f \,d\mu$ generated from
a measurable function $f$ wrt a measure $\mu$ on its domain: From ""Weak Compactness"" in Section 19 ""The $L^p$ spaces"" of
""Probability and Measure"" by Billingsley: Suppose that $f$ and $f_n$ are elements of $L^p(\Omega,  \mathcal{F},\mu)$. If $\int f \times g \, d\mu= \lim_{n\rightarrow 
    \infty} \int f \times g \, d\mu$ for each $g$ in $L^q(\Omega, 
    \mathcal{F},\mu)$ with $1/p + 1/q = 1$, then $f_n$ converges weakly
  to
  $f$. At the end of Section 4.1 of ""A Course in Probability Theory"" by Kai
Lai Chung, weak convergence of random variables in $L^1$
space is also defined similarly to Billingsley's. In terms of the pushforward measure of a measurable function: In Wikipedia , In this case the term weak convergence is preferable (see weak
  convergence of measures), and we say that a sequence of random
  elements $\{X_n\}$ converges weakly to $X$  if $$
         \operatorname{E}^*h(X_n) \to \operatorname{E}\,h(X)  $$ for all continuous bounded functions $h(·)$. Here $E^*$ denotes the
  outer
  expectation, that is the expectation of a “smallest measurable
  function g that dominates $h(X_n)$”. Also from Wikipedia : Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space and
  $\textbf{X}$ be a metric space. If $X_n, X: Ω → \textbf{X}$ is a
  sequence of random variables then $X_n$ is said to converge weakly (or
  in distribution or in law) to $X$ as $n → ∞$ if the sequence of
  pushforward measures $(X_n)_∗(P)$ converges weakly to $X_∗(P)$ in the
  sense of weak convergence of measures on $\textbf{X}$. I wonder if the two definitions of weak convergence of measurable functions are equivalent? Why are there two different definitions for the same concept? Thanks and regards!","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

If $f$ maps sets of measure $0$ to sets of measure $0$, then the function $g(x) = x + f(x)$ satisfies the same property.

If $A$ is measurable s.t. $m(A)=0$ ($m$ is the Lebesgue measure), then we can find a decreasing sequence of open sets $(O_n)$ such that $A \subset O_n$ and $m(O_n)\downarrow_n 0$. If $O=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty O_n$, then

74003,What's wrong with my epsilon delta proof here?,"Claim: $$\lim_{x\to 1} \frac{100}{x} = 100$$ Proof: Let any $\epsilon > 0.\  |\frac{100}{x}-100| = 100 |\frac{1}{x}-1| = 100 \frac{|x-1|}{|x|}.$ If this term is smaller than epsilon in the interval where $0<|x-1|<\delta$, then we are done. Assume $\delta=100.$ Then, $|x-1|<100, -99<x<101, -1/99<1/x<1/100$ Thus $100 \frac{|x-1|}{|x|} <\frac{ 100}{100*|x-1|}$ So if $0<|x-1|< \min\{\epsilon, 100\}=\delta,$ then $|\frac{100}{x}-100| < \epsilon$.

The interior chart is then $(U,\phi)$ where $U$ is open in $M$ and $\phi:U\to V\subseteq \mathbb R^n$ is a homeomorphism (here $V$ is open in $\mathbb R^n$) and boundary chart as $(U',\phi')$ where $U'$ is open in $M$ and $\phi':U'\to V'\subseteq \mathbb H^n$ is a homeomorphism (here $V$ is open in $\mathbb H^n$ and $V'\cap \partial \mathbb H^n\neq\emptyset$). Then he writes: If M is an $n$-manifold with boundary, a point $p$ in $M$ is called an interior point
  of $M$ if it is in the domain of an interior chart; and it is called a boundary point of
  $M$ if it is in the domain of a boundary chart that takes $p$ to $\partial \mathbb H^n$. The natural question is - can be $p$ both interior and boundary point of $M$? In 2011 version of the book Lee writes: Every point of M is either an interior
  point or a boundary point: if $p \in  M$ is in the domain of an interior chart, then it is
  an interior point; on the other hand, if it is in the domain of a boundary chart, then it
  is an interior point if its image lies in $\operatorname{Int}\mathbb H^n$, and a boundary point if the image lies
  in $\partial \mathbb H^n$. I cannot understand his argumentation.

A previous question in the exercise was $12^{\log_{12} 144}$, which is pretty straight forward since $\log_{12} 144=2$ and $12^2=144$ but since $\log_5 17$ is an irrational number, I couldn't calculate it the same way. So my question is, why is $x^{\log_x n}=n$? [Update] I've now managed to reason this out and realized how simple it is.  Basically, if $y=\log_x n$, then $y$ is the number that  $x$ must be raised to to become $n$; therefore, if I raise $x$ to that power $y$, I will naturally get $n$. I guess my problem was that I tried to work out the question mechanically instead of intelligently and that's why I failed, because once I realized that I can't calculate $\log_5 17$, I was stumped.  Now that I reasoned it out, as explained in the previous paragraph, I understand it.","['logarithms', 'algebra-precalculus']"

74077,"Are any two Cantor sets ; ""Fat"" and ""Standard"" Diffeomorphic to each Other?","All:
I know any two Cantor sets; ""fat"" , and ""Standard""(middle-third) are homeomorphic to each other. Still, are they diffeomorphic to each other? I think yes, since they are both $0$-dimensional manifolds (###), and any two $0$-dimensional manifolds are diffeomorphic to each other. Still, I saw an argument somewhere where the claim is that the two are not diffeomorphic. The argument is along the lines that, for $C$ the characteristic function of the standard Cantor set integrates to $0$ , since $C$ has (Lebesgue) measure zero, but , if $g$ where a diffeomorphism into a fat Cantor set $C'$, then: $ f(g(x))$ is the indicator function for $C'$, so its integral is positive. And (my apologies, I don't remember the Tex for integral and I don't have enough points to look at someone else's edit ; if someone could please let me know ) By the chain rule, the change-of-variable $\int_0^1 f(g(x))g'(x)dx$ should equal $\int_a^b f(x)dx$ but $g'(x)>0$ and $f(g(x))>0$ . So the change-of-variable is
contradicted by the assumption of the existence of the diffeomorphism $g$ between $C$ and $C'$. Is this right?

I also am having a bit of trouble considering the domains of previous functions in the evaluation of the aforementioned values. For example, if we have the following function (and this may be a terrible example...): $$f(x)=\frac{x^2+3}{x-1}$$ Then, $$f\space^\prime(x)=\frac{x^2-2x-3}{(x-1)^2}$$ And $$f\space^{\prime\prime}(x)=\frac{8}{(x-1)^3}$$ So here we are expected to find: $x$ and $y$ intercepts asymptotes CVs of $f\space^\prime(x)$ and $f\space^{\prime\prime}(x)$ determine over which intervals $f(x)$ is increasing and decreasing determine over what intervals $f(x)$ is concave up or down at what $x$ values we have a local extrema and what that value is EDIT: Inflection Points I am fine with the first few, and can power through the last to some degree of success when I am working like problems (such as 13, 14, and 15 in a section, where they would be of the same general question), but when the problems are just random ones picked from a section (Chapter 4 in Swokowski's Calculus, I believe), I completely blank out, leading me to the conclusion that I need to know more about the underlying logic. I always get hung up on drawing the interval graphs, and determining what numbers to test (what to test, and what the results represent, not how to actually test). Also, I have a terrible time considering the domain throughout. For example, I know that $D=\mathbb{R}\setminus\{1\}$ for $f(x)$, but I'm not sure what to do with that knowledge throughout the problem.

If $U\in \tau_S$ then there is $V\in \tau$ s.t. $U = V\cap S$. So, for any $x\in U\subseteq V$ there is $r_x$ s.t. $B_{r_x}(x)\subseteq V$ and hence $B'_{r_x}(x) = B_{r_x}(x)\cap S\subseteq V\cap S = U$.

Let $r$ be an integer, and let $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots$ be any numbers. Each of the following relations implies the other: $
\begin{align}
\label{first_eq} \tag{1}
&a_n = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\binom{r - n + j}{j}b_{n-j}, \quad \forall n\geq 1;\\
\label{second_eq} \tag{2}
&b_n = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\binom{r - n + j}{j}(-1)^{j}a_{n-j}, \quad \forall n\geq 1.
\end{align}
$ I'm asking for an elementary, self-contained proof with no use of Chu-Vandermonde summation . If it uses generating functions, better, but binomial identities would be great too. An obvious hint by Andrews is that one can just proof that (2) implies (1), because once it was done, a simple ""variable change"" proves the reverse implication, i.e., just consider $b'_{n} = (-1)^{n}b_n$ and $a'_{n} = (-1)^{n}a_n$.

Sylow congruent number if it is a non prime-power number for which the congruence conditions of Sylow's theorem do not force at least one Sylow subgroup to be normal. In other words we can have $n_p\neq 1$ for all primes $p$ dividing $n$. Denote by $\mathfrak{sc}$ this set. Also denote by $\mathfrak{p}$ the set of prime numbers. Even though we know of the finite simple groups (I don't but some do), it seems unrealistic to expect an clean characterization of $\mathfrak{s}$.

74454,"""Paradox"" of a Poisson process on $\mathbb R$","This question concerns the apparently peculiar behavior around zero of the Poisson process defined over the entire real line $\mathbb R$. A Poisson process $N(A)$ with mean measure $\mu$ on a general topological measure space $(\Omega, \mathcal B, \mathbb P)$ is defined such that for all $A \in \mathcal B$ satisfying $\mu(A) < \infty$,
$$
\mathbb P(N(A) = n) = e^{-\mu(A)} \frac{(\mu(A))^n}{n!}
$$
and for disjoint $A_1,\ldots,A_k$, the $N(A_i)$ are mutually independent. If $\Omega = [0,\infty)$ and $\mu$ is proportional to Lebesgue measure, then we can construct the process $N$ via a sequence $\{T_i\}$ of iid $\mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$ random variables with $X_n = T_1 + \cdots + T_n$ and $N(t) = \#\{n: X_n \leq t\}$. If $\Omega = (-\infty,\infty)$, a simple modification of the above construction works. We take a second iid $\mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$ sequence $\{U_i\}$ independent of the first and place points at $X_{-n} = -(U_1 + \cdots + U_n)$. It seems easy to see that this satisfies the general definition of a Poisson process. We only really need to worry if $A$ contains points on both sides of zero. So, if $A$ is any Borel set on $\mathbb R$, we decompose it as $A = (A \cap (-\infty,0)) \cup (A \cap [0,\infty))$ and then use the fact that the construction on each half-line was independent of one another and that sums of independent Poissons are Poisson. "" Paradox "": Every interarrival time is $\mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$ independently of each other except for the interarrival time that straddles zero, namely $X_1 - X_{-1}$, which is still independent of all other interarrival times, but is $\Gamma(2,\lambda)$ since it is the sum of two independent $\mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$ random variables.

Here is the motivation: Now the the explanation.  I wanted to verify that the humps really were catenaries because that wasn't intuitive to me.  I then proceeded to accidentally prove that if the rate of rotation is constant with respect to the rate of forward motion and the forward motion was in a straight line, the only hump that fits the tangent lines created by this motion requires that the wheel do some significant slipping. Since slipping is obviously not an option, I'm starting by defining the arc length of the curve to be the equal to the arc length of the equivalent position on a side of the wheel with respect to time, which should be the definition of zero slippage. The general form of the curve is given by: $x(t) = f(t)\cos(t) - \sin(t) + p(t)$ $y(t) = -f(t)\sin(t) - \cos(t)$ By creating a line for a side $x(t) = f(t), y(t) = -1$, rotating it by $t$ (rate of rotation is arbitrary constant with time) and moving forward by $p(t)$.  ($g(t)$ in my original setup was $p'(t)$.) Thus $f(t)$ is the position function of the point on the side and $p(t)$ is the position function of the center of the wheel in the x direction.   Which I'd actually like to find later, if I get through all this.  As you can see I assumed no movement in the y direction for the center of the wheel (bumpy ride). So this question is all about restricting $f(t)$ to equal the arc length of the curve it's on for zero slippage.  So $(f'(t))^2 = (x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2$.  Substituting the definitions of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, I simplified.  A lot.  Rotational translation usually involves lots of canceling and the trig identity $\sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t) = 1$.

74626,"Is $H^2$ weakly closed in $H$? Isaacs Finite Group Theory, exercise 8B.6","I'm trying to solve exercise 8B.6 on page 249 of Isaacs's Finite Group Theory textbook (the second question in a series; this is the third as question here ).  I have an idea, but it doesn't quite work.  It seems like the precursor to the idea in the next exercise, so I'd really like for it to work. Can my idea be fixed? The exercise asks: If $G$ is a finite primitive permutation group with a point stabilizer $H$ that has an orbit of size 2, then $G$ is dihedral of order twice an odd prime in its natural action. The previous exercise had the stabilizer's orbit size reduced to 1, and it followed by showing a maximal subgroup contained in two point stabilizers had to be the identity (which caused a huge collapse: $G$ is then cyclic of prime order).  Ok, so I want to do the same thing, $H$ has a big subgroup contained in two stabilizers, so that big subgroup is the identity (which finishes the whole thing for my choice of subgroup). Here was the smaller question I had while doing that, but I answered it depressingly as: ""No."" Suppose $H$ is a maximal subgroup of the finite group $G$, and let $K = H^2 = E^2(H)$ be the subgroup of $H$ generated by the squares of the elements in $H$.  If $g\in G$ takes $K$ to $K^g ≤ H$, then must $g$ normalize $K$? Well, taking $G$ to be $\operatorname{PGL}(2,q)$ for $q ≡ ±3\bmod 8$, and $H$ to be a Sylow 2-subgroup (so a dihedral group of order 8 with partial fusion), then $K$ is the order 2 normal subgroup of $H$ and is not weakly closed: there is a $g\in G$ that takes $K$ to a non-normal subgroup of order 2 in $H$.  When $q = 3$, $H$ is a maximal subgroup of $G ≅ S_4$. Now the action of $G$ on the cosets of $P$ is primitive, but not faithful, so this isn't actually a counterexample, but wow it seems close. Is it true that $K$ is weakly closed in $H$ (with respect to $G$) if $H$ is core-free (with respect to $G$)? The only reason $H$ had a core was because $q$ was chosen so small.  But all $q$ have the same basic setup as far as the relationship of $K$ in $H$ and conjugation in $G$, it is just that $H$ is no longer maximal for larger $q$.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"
