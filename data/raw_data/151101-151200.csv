2520682,"If a probability is strictly positive, is it discrete?","Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space. Call $P$ strictly positive if $P(F)>0$ for all $F \in \mathcal{F} \setminus \{\emptyset\}$. Call $F \in \mathcal{F}$ an atom if $P(F)>0$ and $P(A)=0$ for all strict, measurable subsets $A$ of $F$. Note that if $P$ is strictly positive and $F$ is an atom, then the only strict, measurable subset of $F$ is $\emptyset$. Call $P$ discrete if there exists a countable set $\mathcal{D}$ of pairwise disjoint atoms such that $\sum_{F \in \mathcal{D}}P(F)=1$. If $P$ is strictly positive, does it follow that $P$ is discrete? If $\Omega$ is countable, then $\mathcal{F}$ is generated by a countable partition, the cells of which are atoms, and the result follows. If $\Omega$ is uncountable, then either $\mathcal{F}$ is finite or uncountable; $\mathcal{F}$ cannot be countably infinite. In the case where $\mathcal{F}$ is finite, it seems obvious to me that the result holds and I will omit a proof. The case that I am stuck on is the final one where $\mathcal{F}$ is uncountable.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'elementary-set-theory']"
2520687,Why is it that Runge's phenomenon gives rise to oscillations at the edges and not in other locations?,"Why is it that Runge's phenomenon gives rise to oscillations at the edges and not in other locations? What I don't understand is why the oscillations arises at the edges and not somewhere else? What seems weird to me is that the phenomenon seems to arise due to the sampling scheme of the interpolation points (or at least that is how its emphasized in the wikipedia article). Thus, if its a problem due to sampling why is it that the oscillations concentrate at the edges and not at other places? I'd love to be able to go through the proof myself but with a weak background in basic analysis makes me doubt my capabilities of this. Therefore, intuitive/conceptual explanations are probably the ones I will most likely understand best, though I don't want to discourage people that want to provide a in depth answer, though don't forget to try to provide a high level one too if its not too much to ask.","['functional-analysis', 'numerical-methods', 'real-analysis', 'interpolation']"

with  ${a\choose b}$ a binomial coefficient. (i) Show that $a_{n,k}$ is even. [EDIT: I have just found a proof for (i). Hint: $a_{n,k}$ is the coefficient of $x^{2n-k}$ in the power series expansion of $\frac{(1+x)^n}{(1-x)^{k+1}}-(1+x)^n$.  ] 2nd EDIT: here is my tentative proof with details (is it
  correct?):\begin{align*}a_{n,k}&=\sum_{j= k+1}^{2n}{j\choose

  known that: $\sum_{g\ge0}{g+k\choose k}x^g=(1-x)^{-k-1}$ and
  $\sum_{g\ge0}{n\choose g}x^g=(1+x)^n$, so that:
  $$\frac{(1+x)^n}{(1-x)^{k+1}} -(1+x)^n = \sum_{h \ge 0} \sum_{g=

  $$[[x^{2n-k}]]\left((1-x)^{n-k-1} -(1+x)^n \right) \equiv a_{n,k}
\pmod 2.$$ There are two cases: $\circ$ If $k+1\le n$  then $2n-k \ge n +1$, hence $2n-k > n $  and 
  $2n-k > n -k-1 \ge 0 $, hence:   \begin{align*} a_{n,k}&\equiv (-1)^k

I know that \begin{align*}\sum_{j= k}^{n}{j\choose k}{n\choose j} =2^{n-k}{n\choose k}\end{align*} and I would expect some similar expression for $a_{n,k}$, but that does not seem to be straightforward.

Show that $(f_{n})$ is also a orthonormal basis. Remark: My idea was the following: First I show the following fact: Fact 1: Let $H$ be a Hilbert space, $(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ a orthonormal basis of $H$, and let $(y_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in $H$ such that

2520820,Can I always order a countable set of numbers?,"Suppose I have a countable subset of the real numbers $A$ . Then since it is countable there is a function $f: \mathbb N \to A$ which is bijective. This function is of course a sequence, so we can write every element $x$ of $A$ as $x_i = f(i)$ . So $A= \{ x_i \mid i \in \mathbb N \}$ . Of course no two $x_i$ and $x_j$ are the same. I can now come and reorder the $x_i$ 's (instead of naming the $x \in A$ as $x_i$ I can name it $x_j$ ) such that they are decreasing $$x_1 >x_2>\cdots. $$ (Trivial??) Question: I CAN do that right? It seems right, since any $x_i$ and $x_j$ are different, then one is bigger than the other, thus I can do this comparison with all of them and order them. If that is the case then take as $A= \Bbb Q \cap (0,1)$ for example. What we said above is that since $A$ is countable I can write $A= \Bbb Q \cap (0,1)=\{ x_i \mid i \in \mathbb N \}$ with $x_1 >x_2>\cdots$ . But that is absurd, there is no biggest rational in $(0,1)$ . It's late, what am I missing? EDIT. Also suppose a case where there IS a biggest number such as $A=\Bbb Q \cap (0,0.9]$ where the biggest rational is $0.9$ . Then we can do $ 0.9=x_1 <x_2 <x_3<\cdots$ .

2520880,Proof that $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\frac{n!}{n^n}$ is $0$,"As stated in the title, I'm trying to prove that the sequence $\{a_n\}$ defined by: $$a_n=\frac{n!}{n^n}$$ Converges to zero. That is:
$$\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{n!}{n^n}=0$$ For example, I was thinking that for a sufficiently big $n$:
$$a_n=\frac{n}{n}\cdot\frac{n-1}{n}\cdot\frac{n-2}{n}\cdots\frac{1}{n}= \frac{n-1}{n}\cdot\frac{n-2}{n}\cdots\frac{1}{n}$$
Then these $n-2$ factors 
$$\frac{n-1}{n}, \frac{n-2}{n}, \frac{n-3}{n},\cdots,\frac{2}{n}$$ 
are all smaller (or equal) than the first, then: 
$$a_n\le\Bigl(\frac{n-1}{n}\Bigr)^{n-2}\Bigl(\frac{1}{n}\Bigr)$$
Now, since $\frac{n-1}{n}\le1$, we can claim that:
$$a_n\le\frac{1}{n}$$
which would instantly proof what I wanted by squeezing the sequence between $0$. I'm not entirely convinced by this argument,and I have the feeling that there must be some mistake or something that I'm taking for granted. I'd love some feedback or even some other proofs for this.

2520903,Probably that an $80\%$-truthful person actually rolled a $6$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : A man who lies a fourth of the time throws a die and says it is a six. What is the probability it is actually a six? (2 answers) Closed 6 years ago . A person, $A$, speaks the truth $4$ out of $5$ times. The person throws a die and reports that he obtained a $6$. What is the probability that he actually rolled a $6$? I know there is a similar question like this 
but my doubts are different from it and also I want to identify and solve total probability theorem questions so I posted a side doubt also.
In my attempt, I defined the events \begin{align*}
 E_1&: \text{The person tells the truth.} \\
 E_2&: \text{The person lies.} \\
 E_3&: \text{The person reports that the die landed on a 6.} 
\end{align*} I noted that $P(E_1)=\frac{4}{5}$, $P(E_2)=\frac{1}{5}$, $P(E_3|E_1)=6^{-1}$ and
$P(E_3|E_2)=0$ and obtained \begin{align*}
 P(E_3) = \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{5} \cdot 0 = \frac{2}{15}.
\end{align*}
However, the correct answer is, $\frac{4}{9}$. What did I do wrong?

2520921,Is it correct way to show that $\mathcal C_{\mathcal C}(\mathbb R)$ is incomplete,"This question below is inspired by this one .

So $\{f_n\}$ is Cauchy. If possible let $f_n\to f$ in $\mathcal C_{\mathcal C}(\mathbb R).$ Then $\text{supp}f\subset[a,b]$ for some $a,b\in R.$ Choose an odd natural number $k\in\mathbb N$ such that $k.\dfrac{\pi}{2}>b$ Then $f(k.\dfrac{\pi}{2})=0.$ But $f_n(k.\dfrac{\pi}{2})=\dfrac{1}{\frac{k-1}{2}+1}=\dfrac{2}{k+1}~\forall~n\ge k$ since $\frac{k-1}{2}\pi\le\frac{k}{2}\pi\le\frac{k+1}{2}\pi.$ So $||f_n-f||\ge|f_n(k.\dfrac{\pi}{2})-f(k.\dfrac{\pi}{2})|=\dfrac{2}{k+1}$ for all $n\ge k,$ a contradiction.

Suppose there exist isomorphic subbundles $V \subseteq \tilde V,W \subseteq \tilde W$ of rank $k-1$ , i.e $V \cong W$ . Then we have the following claim: Proposition: $\tilde V,\tilde W$ are isomorphic as vector bundles, and so are the quotients $\tilde V/V \cong \tilde W/W$ . Question: I would like to find a proof of the proposition which does not involve introducing a metric. Here is my proof (using metrics): Fix orientations on $\tilde V,\tilde W$ .
Let $\Phi:V \to W$ be an isomorphism. Put a (smooth) metric on $W$ , and pull it back by $\Phi$ to $V$ , thus making $\Phi$ as isometry. Now extend the metrics to $\tilde V,\tilde W$ . Since the ""codimension"" of $V$ in $\tilde V$ is $1$ (and so for $W, \tilde W$ ), there exist a unique isometric bundle isomorphism $\Phi^{\perp}:V^{\perp} \to W^{\perp}$ making $\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}:\tilde V \to \tilde W$ an isometric orientation preserving bundle isomorphism. Note that this $\Phi^{\perp}$ is smooth . In particular, we showed that $\tilde V \cong \tilde W$ , and $\tilde V/V \cong V^{\perp} \cong W^{\perp} \cong \tilde W/W$ . Edit: (elaboration on the construction of $\Phi^{\perp}$ ) Here is an explicit construction of $\Phi^{\perp}:V^{\perp} \to W^{\perp}$ : Let $v_1,\dots,v_{k-1},v_k $ be a local positive orthonormal frame for $\tilde V$ such that $\text{span}\{v_1,\dots,v_{k-1}\}=V$ and $\text{span}(v_k)=V^{\perp}$ . (such a frame can always be chosen locally, see below). Now, define $$\Phi^{\perp}(v_k)=\Phi^{\perp}\big(\star_{\tilde V}^{k-1}(v_1 \wedge \dots \wedge v_{k-1})\big):=\star_{\tilde W}^{k-1}\big(\Phi(v_1) \wedge \dots \wedge \Phi(v_{k-1})\big), \tag{1}$$ where $\star_{\tilde V}^{k-1}:\Lambda_{k-1}(\tilde V) \to \Lambda_{1}(\tilde V)=\tilde V$ is the Hodge dual of $\tilde V$ which is defined via the metric and orientation (same for $\tilde W$ ). It is immediate from the definitions of the Hodge dual, that $$\Phi^{\perp}(v_k) \in \big(\text{span}\{\Phi(v_1),\dots,\Phi(v_{k-1})\}\big)^{\perp}=W|_{U}^{\perp},$$ where the last equality follows from the assumed surjectivity of $\Phi:V \to W$ . ( $U \subseteq M$ is the small set over which we have our local frame). This makes $\Phi^{\perp}$ an isometric isomorphism $V^{\perp} \to W^{\perp}$ . Moreover, this makes $\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}:\tilde V \to \tilde W$ an isometric orientation preserving isomorphism (indeed, it takes the positive orthonormal frame $v_1,\dots,v_k$ of $\tilde V$ to a positive orhtonormal frame in $\tilde W$ ). In particular this shows $\Phi^{\perp}:V^{\perp} \to W^{\perp}$ is well defined, i.e it does not depend on the frame we chose. The reason is that $V^{\perp},W^{\perp}$ are of rank $1$ , and there are only two isometric maps between $1$ -dim inner product spaces. Here we know how to ""choose the right one"" at each fiber, due to the requirement that the ""big"" combined map $\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}$ will be orientation-preserving. Moreover, the continuity of the orientations, implies this choice is ""smooth"" along  changing fibers. It is here that we use the fact $\tilde V,\tilde W$ were orientable. An extended comment regarding the uniqueness (and smoothness) of $\Phi^{\perp}$ : We didn't really had a choice in constructing $\Phi^{\perp}$ . The uniqueness is a ""pointwise-linear algebra"" phenomenon. Indeed, suppose $\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}$ is an isometric orientation preserving isomorphism. Then, since orientation preserving isometries commute with Hodge duals we must have $$ \Phi^{\perp}(v_k)=\big(\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}\big)(v_k)=\big(\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}\big)\big(\star_{\tilde V}^{k-1}(v_1 \wedge \dots \wedge v_{k-1})\big)=$$ $$ \star_{\tilde W}^{k-1}\big( \bigwedge^{k-1}\big(\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}\big)(v_1 \wedge \dots \wedge v_{k-1})\big)=\star_{\tilde W}^{k-1}\big( \big(\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}\big)(v_1) \wedge \dots \wedge \big(\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}\big)(v_{k-1})\big)=$$ $$ \star_{\tilde W}^{k-1}\big( \Phi (v_1) \wedge \dots \wedge \Phi (v_{k-1})\big).$$ This is exactly our definition in equation $(1)$ . In particular this uniqueness implies $\Phi^{\perp}$ is smooth, since it takes a smooth frame to a smooth frame. A comment regarding the existence of a suitable frame $v_1,\dots,v_{k-1},v_k$ : We can always choose a local orthonormal frame $v_1,\dots,v_{k-1}$ for $V$ . Now, we can also choose an orthonormal frame $v_k$ for $V^{\perp}$ . If we restrict everything to be over a connected subset $U \subseteq M$ , then we must have that the resulting frame $v_1,\dots,v_{k-1},v_k$ for $\tilde V$ is positively oriented or negatively oriented. So, if need be, we just replace $v_k$ by $-v_k$ and we are done.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-topology', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry', 'quotient-spaces']"

z &\mapsto& \exp(z)=\displaystyle{\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!}.}

My idea is to show that the real exponential $\exp|_\Bbb R$ maps surjectively to $(0,\infty)$, then show that $\{\exp(ix)\,|\, x\in \Bbb R \} = \Bbb S^1$ and conclude $\exp(\Bbb C)=(0,\infty)\cdot\Bbb S^1 = \Bbb C^\times$. This works because for any $z=a+ib \in \Bbb C$ we have $\exp(z)=\exp(a+ib)=\exp(a)\exp(ib)$. This is easy to show, using the definition and the cauchy product rule for series. To show that $\text{Im}(\exp|_\Bbb R)=(0, \infty)$, we notice that $\exp(x)>1+x$ for $x>0$ and $\exp(0)=1$. So $\exp|_\Bbb R$ takes any value in $[1,\infty)$ by the intermediate value theorem. Since $\exp(-z)=\exp(z)^{-1}$ for any $z\in \Bbb C$, it also takes any value in $(0,1)$. Unfortunately I don't know how to show the second part, i.e. $\{\exp(ix)\,|\, x\in \Bbb R \} = \Bbb S^1$.

2521261,Linear approximation for an area between three circles,"I want to compute the area of a set bounded by three circles. Let $x,y \in [0,1]$, and $\theta \in [0,\pi]$, and consider the three disks $D_1, D_2, D_3$ with unit radius, and centers at the points $(0,0), (x,0), (y \cos \theta, y \sin \theta)$, respectively. What is $A_\theta(x,y) = area(D_1 \cap D_2^c \cap D_3^c)$? (The set $D_1 \cap D_2^c \cap D_3^c = D_1 \setminus (D_2 \cup D_3)$ is an intersection of two crescent shapes.) It probably isn't possible to give a 'nice' formula for the area in terms of $x,y,$ and $\theta$: all I really care about is a linear approximation for $A_\theta(x,y)$ as a function of $x$ and $y$ as $x,y \to 0$, for fixed $\theta$. I suspect it should have the form ($\star$) $A_\theta(x,y) = c_1(\theta) x + c_2(\theta) y + O(xy, x^2, y^2).$ and I would like to know $c_1$ and $c_2$. Even if $c_1$ and $c_2$ can't be computed, I would still like to know if the Taylor series does have the form $(\star)$, or if not, determine what form it should have. As an example, one can easily compute the area of a single 'crescent' $D_1 \cap D_2^c$: it essentially comes down to computing the area of intersection of two circles whose radii are $x$ apart. (The set $D_1 \cap D_2^c$ is the crescent shaped region outside the unit disk $D_1$ and inside the shifted disk $D_2$.) This yields $area(D_1 \cap D_2^c) = \pi-2\arccos(x/2)+\frac{x}{2}\sqrt{4-x^2} = 2x - \frac{x^3}{12} + O(x^5)$ as $x \to 0$. I can only handle the two trivial cases right now: when $\theta = \pi$, some simple estimates yield the bound $A_\pi(x,y) \leq 4 \sqrt{2} \max(x,y)^3$, so in that case $c_1 = c_2 = 0$, and $A$ decays faster than linearly as $x,y \to 0$. When $\theta = 0$, the intersection reduces to the case above (with just 2 circles), and the area is just $A_0(x,y) = 2 \min(x,y) + O(\min(x,y)^3)$. I know there are formulas out there for intersections of multiple circles, but so far I've found them too general to apply here. Understanding the set analytically just seems too difficult right now: I can't even get a reasonable expression for the intersection point of the two circles $D_2$ and $D_3$ in terms of $x,y,$ and $\theta$. I think there may be hope in somehow dividing the intersection into two parts: one bounded by $D_1$ and $D_2$, and the other bounded by  $D_1$ and $D_3$, and analyzing these separately. But I haven't got that to work yet. Edit: Added a picture for clarity. The shaded region is what I'm interested in.","['area', 'analysis', 'geometry']"

  following: there are only a finite number of isomorphism classes of
  smooth projective curves over $k$ of genus $g$. I wonder whether there are some approaches to this problem other than theory of moduli space. In this answer , the approach is to use some version of the canonical embedding to show that the curve can be realized in some projective space by equations bounded by some degree, and then observe that there are only finitely many polynomials with a given number of variables and of given degree over $k$. However, I feel confused about some points for such approach. First of all, is the embedding of curve to the projective space related to the divisor in the finite field case in the same way as the algebraically closed field case? To find a divisor of degree approximately $2g+1$, I think there should be some assumption of $k$-rational point of $X$. Secondly, is the number of polynomials needed to define $X$ in the projective space is bounded only by $g$? If X is not completely intersection, there might be large degree hypersurface needed in the definition of $X$. Again, I am a little confused about degree in the non-algebraically closed field.

2521345,"Precisely, what is the polar coordinate system?","We all have seen the polar coordinate system back in high school. Recall that $S^2$ may be parametrized by $(\theta,\phi)$ with the correspondence

x(\theta,\phi) &= \sin(\theta)\cos(\phi) \\
y(\theta,\phi) &=  \sin(\theta)\sin(\phi) \\
z(\theta,\phi) &= \cos(\theta)
\end{align}$$ where $\theta\in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi\in [0,2\pi)$. There's nothing complicated about this. However, as I began to study some differential geometry and manifold, I find this to be confusing. Viewing $S^2$ as a $2$-dimensional manifold, we want to think of this parametrization as a coordinate chart $(U,\psi)$, where $\psi$ maps $(x,y,z)$ to the corresponding $(\theta,\phi)$ in $\Bbb R^2$. Then $\psi^{-1}$ would be our parametrization of the sphere. However, the definition requires that $\psi$ is a diffeomorphism from the open set $U$ onto its image. Clearly $[0,\pi]\times [0,2\pi)$ is not open (this is related to the fact that there's no global chart for $S^2$). Yes, we may restrict to $U\subsetneq S^2$ but that is not my question. In the language of manifold theory, what does it mean to talk about the global chart or the global parametrization of a sphere? Even though I know that it's an abuse of languge, strictly speaking, but it appears a lot in the literature.

(r,\varphi^1,\dots,\varphi^{d-1})

This was supposed to be surprising, since the ordinary picture of a torus we have in our heads looks inherently curved. However, thinking instead of a torus as a square in the plane with opposite points identified, it becomes 'clear' that the torus at least admits a flat metric, because the plane admits a flat metric. However, a two-holed torus can also be obtained in this way: it is an octagon in the plane with appropriate pairs of edges identified. However, by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, this surface does not admit a flat metric. Thus, something about the way we make the identifications for the 1-torus is compatible with the flat metric structure on the plane, and this is not so for the 2-torus. I am hence lead to ask: Given a smooth manifold $M$ obtained from $\mathbb{R}^n$ by appropriate identifications, is there some general criterion for determining whether the flat metric on $\mathbb{R}^n$ descends to $M$?

2521624,How does equality $\mathfrak{m}^\mathfrak{m} = 2^\mathfrak{m}$ in $\sf{ZF}$ relate to the axiom of choice?,"Usually, the equality
$\mathfrak{m}^\mathfrak{m} = 2^\mathfrak{m}$
for infinite cardinal $\mathfrak{m}$ is proved like that:
$$
2^\mathfrak{m} \leqslant \mathfrak{m}^\mathfrak{m} \leqslant (2^\mathfrak{m})^\mathfrak{m} = 2^{\mathfrak{m} \cdot \mathfrak{m}} = 2^\mathfrak{m}
$$
The last step relies much on the axiom of choice, because the fact $\mathfrak{m}\cdot\mathfrak{m} = \mathfrak{m}$ does. Moreover, Tarski's theorem states that in $\sf{ZF}$ this fact is equivalent to $\sf{AC}$. Note, by a cardinal I mean an equipollence class of an arbitrary set, not necessarily admitting a well-ordering. That has motivated my question: what can we say about relationship of the initial equality and the axiom of choice in pure $\sf{ZF}$? To avoid question about definition of cardinals without $\sf{AC}$, we may consider the following statement instead: For any infinite set $X$ exists a bijection $\; F \, \colon X^X \rightarrow 2^X$ where $X^X$ is the set of all functions from $X$ to $X$, $\; 2^X = \mathcal P(X)$ is the power set, and an infinite set is such that cannot be bijectively mapped onto a finite ordinal.","['cardinals', 'set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"

Is this the marginal distribution of $X_2$? Can someone elaborate the marginal distribution? EDIT: proof
Let's simply look at $X_2$ to start, then $$\mathbb{P}(X_2=x)=\sum_{y=0}^n \mathbb{P}(X_2=x\mid X_1=y)\mathbb{P}(X_1=y)$$ If $y<x$, the conditional probability is $0$, thus $$\mathbb{P}(X_2=x)=\sum_{y=x}^n \mathbb{P}(X_2=x\mid X_1=y)\mathbb{P}(X_1=y)$$ We can now write $$\begin{eqnarray}\mathbb{P}(X_2=x\mid X_1=y) & = & {y \choose x} p^x q^{y-x} \\ \mathbb{P}(X_1=y) & = & {n \choose y} p^y q^{n-y}  \end{eqnarray}$$ and thus $$\mathbb{P}(X_2=x)=\sum_{y=x}^n {y \choose x} p^x q^{y-x} {n \choose y} p^y q^{n-y}$$ We can work out the combinatorial factors and regroup some other factors $$\begin{eqnarray}\mathbb{P}(X_2=x) & = & p^x q^{n-x} \sum_{y=x}^n \frac{n!}{x!(y-x)!(n-y)!} p^y \\ & = &\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x q^{n-x} \sum_{y=x}^n \frac{(n-x)!}{(y-x)!((n-x)-(y-x))!} p^y \\ & = &\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^{2x} q^{n-x} \sum_{z=0}^{n-x} \frac{(n-x)!}{(z)!((n-x)-z)!} p^z \end{eqnarray} $$ In the last step, you recognize with the binomium of Newton $(1+p)^{n-x}$, thus $$\begin{eqnarray}\mathbb{P}(X_2=x) & = & \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^{2x} q^{n-x} (1+p)^{n-x}\\ & = & \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^{2x} (1-p)^{n-x} (1+p)^{n-x}\\ & = & \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}(p^2)^{x} (1-p^2)^{n-x} \\ \end{eqnarray} $$ This means that $X_2 \sim B(n,p^2)$.","['statistics', 'binomial-distribution']"

2522354,Solving $\sin\left(\frac\theta2\right)=-\frac{1}{2}$.,"Solve $\sin\left(\frac\theta2\right)=-\frac{1}{2}$. I have a slight concern about this question. Suppose that I use the half-angle identity to solve the problem over only $[0,2\pi)$: $$\pm\sqrt{1-\cos\theta\over2}=-{1\over2}$$ $${1-\cos\theta\over2} = {1\over4}$$ $$\cos\theta = {1\over2}$$ $$\theta = {\pi\over3},{5\pi\over3}.$$ Now if I want to extend this to find all the solutions over the reals, why can I not simply just add $2\pi n$ to it and be done? Isn't the period of $\cos\theta$ determined to be $2\pi$? I know that the period of $\sin\left({\theta\over2}\right)$ is $T={2\pi\over1/2} = 4\pi$, so why do I have a difference here? I guess my question is, why do I end up with two different periods I could use? According to WolframAlpha, the answer requires the $4\pi$ period, but I'm not sure why . Is it because squaring the problem transforms the problem to something else that causes extraneous solutions to arise? For the record, I originally solved the problem by saying $u = {\theta\over2}$, which means $$\sin(u)=-{1\over2} \implies u = {7\pi\over6} + 2\pi n \text{ or } u = {11\pi\over6}+2\pi n$$ $$\implies {\theta\over2} = {7\pi\over6} + 2\pi n \text{ or } {\theta\over2} = {11\pi\over6}+2\pi n$$ $$\implies \theta = {7\pi\over3} + 4\pi n \text{ or } \theta = {11\pi\over3} + 4\pi n,$$ which is the solution that WolframAlpha provides. However, I wanted to see how to solve the problem using the half-angle identity.","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry', 'proof-verification']"
2522386,Proof that there exists a string of strictly increasing or decreasing (not necessarily consecutive) integers inside a permutation of $\Bbb{Z_n}$,"Let $A$ be a permutation of $\Bbb{Z_n}$. In other words, $A:\Bbb{Z_n} \to \Bbb{Z_n}$ is a bijection. Prove: $$\exists_{I\, \subset \, \Bbb{Z_n}}\,\vert I \vert = \lfloor \sqrt{n-1} \rfloor \, \land \, (\forall_{x,y\, \in \, I} \; (x<y)\to(A(x) < A(y)) \, \lor \, \forall_{x,y \, \in \, I} \; (x<y)\to (A(x) > A(y)))$$ Essentially, if you take the first $n$ whole numbers and consider them to be a finite sequence with no repeats, then there is a not-necessarily consecutive subsequence of length $\lfloor \sqrt{n-1} \rfloor$ of strictly increasing or decreasing values. It's a sort of ""unavoidable pattern"" when dealing with finite sequences of non-repeated integers. For example, take this permutation of $\Bbb{Z_{10}}: \{2, 0, 3, 6, 8, 7, 1, 9, 4, 5\}$. The set $I$, in this case, would always have cardinality of $3$ because $3 = \lfloor \sqrt{10-1} \rfloor$. $I$, for example, could be $\{0,2,4\}$ because $2 < 3 < 8$. Or the set $I$ could be $\{4, 5, 9\}$ because $8 > 7 > 5$. The proof only needs to prove the existence of one such $I$ for any permutation of $\Bbb{Z_n}$, either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. I remember this proof being an exercise in Discrete Mathematics 2 and it had something to do with the pigeonhole principle. I would love to reprove this, but I have lost my notes!

Also, $\varepsilon$ is the vector of uncorrelated errors with zero mean, $\varepsilon_i,i=1,2,\ldots,n$ where $\mathrm{Var}(\varepsilon_i) = \sigma^2.$ Now, the MLE of $\sigma^2$ in the multiple linear model is $$\hat{\sigma}^2 := \frac{1}{n} (y-XB)^T (y-XB)

$$\mathbb{E}(\hat{\sigma}^2) = \frac{1}{n} ( \mathrm{tr}(I_{n\times n}\sigma^2 I_{n\times n}) = \sigma^2.$$ However, this is incorrect as the solution says that it is $\frac{n-p}{n}\sigma^2$ and it also shows me how it's done. However, I'm not sure where I went wrong.",['statistics']

But that is another discussion. This has bothered me for a long time.  Partial derivatives in Cartesian form are directional derivatives with respect to the standard (unit) basis vectors.  If I rotate my coordinate system so that one axis shares the direction in which I am differentiating, the partial derivative with respect to the corresponding coordinate is a directional derivative with respect to the new (unit) basis vector. If I want to know how much a scalar potential changes with respect to ark length in a given direction, I find the dot product of the gradient with a unit vector in that direction. In some introductory calculus books the directional derivative is defined to be with respect to a unit vector.  There are many places in which the directional derivative with respect to a unit vector is valuable.  I there a good name for that special kind of directional derivative?

2522761,What is a 'localization argument'?,"While reading an article on nonlinear variational problems, the author talked about the possibility to use localization arguments in order to show some coercivity estimates for a given functional. I figured, that what he meant would be something like restricting the functional, which orginally acted on some Sobolev space $W^{1,2}_0(\Omega)$ over a domain $\Omega$, onto one over $W^{1,2}_0(\Omega')$ with $\Omega' \subset\subset \Omega$ being compactly embedded and ""small/local enough"". My question: Can you specify what is (generally) meant by localization arguments and give a prototypical example of their use? Edit (further information) : My problem at hand is an intermediate step in the minimization of the socalled Yang-Mills functional. For this, consider some matrix-valued vector field $A \in W^{1,2}(B^n, \mathbb{R}^n\otimes \mathfrak{g})$ with values in a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. For simplicity, one may think of $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{su}(k)$, the vector space of hermitian trace-less $k\times k$-matrices. We think of $A$ as $n$ matrix-valued functions $(A_i)_{i=1,\ldots,n}$. We then consider the functional $E_0(A) = \int_{B^n} |\mathrm{d}A|^2 + |\mathrm{d}^\ast A|^2 = \int_{B^n} |\mathrm{rot}A|^2 + |\mathrm{div}A|^2$. Here, $\mathrm{d}, \mathrm{d}^\ast$ are the exterior differential , respectively codifferential . This functional is coercive and weakly lower semicontinuous and hence posesses a minimizer. Now, we consider the functional $E(A) = \int_{B^n}|\mathrm{d}A + [A,A]|^2 + |\mathrm{d}^\ast A|^2$, where the first term of the integrand is explicitly given by $\frac14 \sum_{ij} |\partial_i A_j - \partial_j A_i + [A_i,A_j]|^2$. The map $K:W^{1,2}(B^n, \mathbb{R}^n\otimes \mathfrak{g}) \rightarrow L^2(B^n, \mathbb{R}^n\otimes\mathbb{R}^n\otimes \mathfrak{g}), A\mapsto [A,A]$ is (by Sobolev multiplication and embedding theorems) a compact map for dimensions $n\leq 3$.
Now the questions is, if the existence of a minimizer for $E_0$ and the compactness of the pertubation $K$ can be somehow used to show existence of a minimizer for $E$. By a private suggestion of a professor, I was told that this is possible by localization arguments . Unfortunately, I was not able to ask more specific about that suggestion.","['functional-analysis', 'calculus-of-variations', 'analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
