But I would not know how to go from $y \in A$ to $y \in \emptyset$ which is impossible obviously. I also thought about trying $x \in A$ and try to prove $x \notin A$.

1149155,Topological Invariance of Unique Ergodicity,"Show that unique ergodicity is a topological invariant. Is arguing as follows an overkill (hopefully if the logic is correct — I have a feeling that there has to be a way a $T$ -invariant measure has to depend on the $S$ -invariant measure and vice-versa and so that they are unique together)? Let $T$ be a uniquely ergodic transformation acting on the probability space $(X, \mathfrak{A}, \mu)$ and $S$ a transformation acting on $(Y, \mathfrak{B}, \nu)$ . Let $h: (X, \mathfrak{A}) \to (Y, \mathfrak{B})$ be a homeomorphism such that $h \circ T = S \circ h$ . Note that $T^{k}  = h^{-1} \circ S^{k} \circ h$ .  Suppose that $S$ is uniquely ergodic.  We wish to show that $T$ is uniquely ergodic. Let $\phi \in C(X)$ .By one equivalence characterizations of unique ergodicity,we must show that $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\phi(T^{k}(x))$ converges to a constant pointwise on $X$ . Since $S$ is uniquely ergodic. We have in particular for a continuous function $\psi = \phi \circ h^{-1} \in C(Y)$ and each point $h(x) = y$ , the time average $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (\phi \circ h^{-1})(S^{k}(h(x)) )$ converges pointwise to a constant on $Y$ . But then so is $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\phi(T^{k}(x))$ because $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\phi(T^{k}(x))= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (\phi \circ h^{-1})(S^{k}(h(x)) )$ .","['dynamical-systems', 'measure-theory', 'ergodic-theory', 'real-analysis']"

1149451,Equivalent Vitali Covering Properties for Differentiation Bases,"N.B. In what follows below, we work exclusively with the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Def 1 For each $x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$, let $\mathcal{B}(x)$ be a collection of bounded open sets $R$ containing $x$ such that there exists a sequence $\left\{R_{k}\right\}\subset\mathcal{B}(x)$ tending to $\left\{x\right\}$. We say that $\mathcal{B}:=\bigcup\mathcal{B}(x)$ is a differentiation basis . If for $R\in\mathcal{B}$, $x\in R$ implies $R\in\mathcal{B}(x)$, we say that $\mathcal{B}$ is a Busemann-Feller differentiation basis . (Hereafter, all differentiation bases will be BF.) Def 2 Let $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a measurable set. $V\subset\mathcal{B}$ is a $\mathcal{B}$-Vitali covering of $A$ if for each $x\in A$ there exists a sequence $\left\{R_{k}\right\}\subset V$ such that $x\in R_{k}$ and $\text{diam }R_{k}\rightarrow 0$. Def 3 We say that a basis $\mathcal{B}$ has the $V_{q}$ property, where $1<q<\infty$, if there exists  constant $C$ such that for every measurable set $A$, for every $\mathcal{B}$-Vitali covering of $A$, and for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a countable subcollection $\left\{R_{k}\right\}\subset V$ satisfying $\left|A\setminus\bigcup R_{k}\right|=0$, $\left|\bigcup R_{k}\setminus A\right|\leq\varepsilon$ $\left\|\sum \chi_{R_{k}}\right\|_{L^{q}}\leq C\left|A\right|^{1/q}$ Define the upper and lower derivatives of $\int f$ at $x$ respectively by
$$\overline{D}\left(\int f,x\right):=\sup_{\left\{R_{k}\right\}}\limsup_{k}\dfrac{1}{\left|R_{k}\right|}\int_{R_{k}}f, \ \underline{D}\left(\int f,x\right):=\inf_{\left\{R_{k}\right\}}\liminf_{k}\dfrac{1}{\left|R_{k}\right|}\int_{R_{k}}f$$
where the supremum and infimum are respectively taken over all sequences $\left\{R_{k}\right\}\subset\mathcal{B}(x)$ with $\text{diam} R_{k}\rightarrow 0$. It has been shown by A. Cordoba and R. Fefferman [Theorem 2, p. 2212] that the $V_{q}$ property is equivalent to the property that $\mathcal{B}$ differentiates $\int f$ a.e., for $f\in L_{loc}^{p}$, where $1/p+1/q=1$; i.e.,
$$\overline{D}\left(\int f,x\right)=\underline{D}\left(\int f,x\right)=f(x) \ a.e.,$$ It has also been shown by C.A. Hayes [Theorem 2.4, p. 178] that Definition 3 with condition 2 replaced by condition 2*
$$\left\|\sum_{k}\chi_{R_{k}}-\chi_{\bigcup R_{k}}\right\|_{L^{q}}\leq\varepsilon$$
is equivalent to the differentiation property stated above. My question is whether there is a proof of the equivalence of Cordoba's $V_{q}$ property and Hayes's $V_{q}$ property, which does not use the full result that each is equivalent to the differentiation property.","['measure-theory', 'integration', 'real-analysis']"
1149458,The smooth Nullstellensatz,"Let $n$ be a positive integer, let $f_1, \ldots, f_r : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be smooth functions, let $Z_i = f_i^{-1} \{ 0 \} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and suppose $Z_1 \cap \cdots \cap Z_r = \emptyset$. Question. Must there exist smooth functions $g_1, \ldots, g_r : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f_1 g_1 + \cdots + f_r g_r = 1$? I believe the answer is no in general. On the other hand: It suffices to show that there exist smooth functions $g_1, \ldots, g_r : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f_1 g_1 + \cdots + f_r g_r$ vanishes nowhere, because we can rescale. Therefore a counterexample will have the property that, for any smooth functions $g_1, \ldots, g_r : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, $f_1 g_1 + \cdots + f_r g_r$ vanishes somewhere . If $0$ is a regular value for each $f_i$, then the answer is yes: take a partition of unity $h_1 + \cdots + h_r = 1$ where each $h_i$ has support contained in $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z_i$ and then define $g_i = h_i / f_i$.

If this was a finite sum, then yes, for sure I can divide it into separate integrals. But this is an infinite sum. The integrand is a polynomial, an integrable and even continuous function so I don't see any reason why we can't separate that integral of the sum into the sum of the integrals, but it's not apparent to me why it's obvious that we can do that either. But if we can, then the mclaurin series we were looking for is $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\int_0^x\frac{(-1)^{n+1}t^{2n-2}}{2n-1}dt$ is this correct? if so - can we always separate the integral of the sum into sum of integrals? even infinite sums?","['calculus', 'integration', 'infinity', 'summation', 'taylor-expansion']"

For example, given an open set $U$ of the atlas of $M$ I can write $g$ in coordinates as follows $g = g_{ab}\,dx^{a}\otimes dx^{b}$ What would be the analog local expression from the point of view of the frame bundle? Finally, I would like to know a reference where these things are explained in detail. Thanks.","['algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

$$C_1=\{Re^{it}: t\in(0,\pi)\},\quad C_2=[r,R],\quad  C_3=\{re^{it}: t\in(0,\pi)\},\quad C_4=[-R,r]$$
all curves are oriented counterclockwise. It can be seen that $C$ is the boundary of the upper half of the annulus centred at $0$ with inner radius $r$ and outer radius $R$. Let $f(z)=\frac{(\text{Log } z)^3}{1+z^2},\quad Arg(z)\in\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{3\pi}{2}\right)$. Then $\int_Cf(z)d z=\sum_{i=1}^4\int_{C_i}f(z)d z$. Note that $f$ has a singularity $z=i$ inside $C$, thus by Cauchy's integral formula
$$\int_Cf(z)dz=2\pi i\cdot\frac{(\text{Log }  i)^3}{i+i}=\pi\left(\ln|i|+\frac{\pi}{2}i\right)^3=-\frac{\pi^4}{8}i$$
Now consider $\int_{C_i}f(z)d z$:
 $$\begin{aligned}&\left|\int_{C_1}f(z)d z\right|\leq\int_0^\pi\frac{(|\ln R|+|it|)^3}{|1-R^2e^{2it}|}|Re^{it}|dt\leq\int_0^\pi\frac{R(\ln R+t)^3}{R^2-1}|dt\leq \frac{\pi R(\ln R+\pi)^3}{R^2-1}

Does it follow that, if $b^x-x\equiv b^y-y\pmod n$, then $x\equiv y\pmod n$? This is inspired by the comments on a previous answer I wrote , which got me thinking about fixed points on exponentiation. Toying around in Mathematica, I noticed that
$$x\mapsto 9^x-x\pmod{1000}$$
is an injective function. In fact, I noticed that if we replace $9$ by any other number coprime to $1000$, this still holds. Toying around further, I noticed that the list of numbers $n$ other than $1000$ such that all coprime bases $b$ had this property starts the same way as this sequence in OEIS , which is exactly the sequence of $n$ such that $b^n\equiv 1\pmod n$ for $b$ coprime to $n$. I can't prove the lists are equal (but they seem to be), but I can see that $b^n\equiv 1\pmod n$ is a necessary condition for $x\mapsto b^x-x$ to be injective (as it's not even well-defined otherwise). The only insight I have into the problem is that it clearly holds if $b=1$ or $-1$. The latter can be argued as if $(-1)^n\equiv 1\pmod n$ then $n$ is even and $x\mapsto (-1)^x-x$ maps evens to odds and vice versa and is a linear function with unit ($-1$) coefficient of $x$ over those domains - and hence is bijective. I feel like there may be some generalization of this approach by partitioning $(\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z,+)$ into $\text{ord}_n(b)$ cosets (where $\text{ord}$ is the multiplicative order of $b$ mod $n$), but I have been unsuccessful in finding it if it exists. To be sure, restricting the map in question to a single such coset yields a bijection between it and another coset (as $b^{x}-x$ and $b^{x+\text{ord}_n(b)}-x-\text{ord}_n(b)$ are equal mod $\text{ord}_n(b)$) - but I can't prove that two distinct cosets do not map to the same place, as this requires considering the map over the larger domain where it is less well-behaved.

\begin{align}
P(X(t) = Y(t)) = 1 \quad \textit{for all t $\in$ I}

b) $\textit{The stochastic processes X and Y are called indistinguishable}$
\begin{align}
P(X(t) = Y(t) \,\,\,\textit{for all $t \in I$}) = 1

(b) the probability that the entire path of the processes X is equal to the entire path of the process Y, is equal to 1. I don't understand the difference between the two statements. The first seems to examine the processes at each point. The second examines the paths of the processes (which are made up of the points!). Is anyone able to provide a motivational explanation as to why (a) does not mean that the paths are the same? I find it counter intuitive since if the processes are equal at each point then surely their paths are the same? The classic example I've been given which (apparently) shows the two processes to be a modification and not indistinguishable is: $\textbf{Example:}$ Let $\Omega = [0,\infty), \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{B}([0,\infty))$ and $P$ be a probability measure on $\mathcal{A}$ which has a density.

Then $X$ and $Y$ are modifications of each other but $X$ and $Y$ are not indistinguishable. $\textbf{Question:}$ With regard to the example above if $t = 0$ and $\omega = 0$ then $X(0)(0)= 1$ but $Y(0)(0) = 0$, then how can their probability be equal to 1 at this point?

e^{-x^2}<\epsilon/2\\&\Longleftrightarrow&
\log\left(e^{-x^2}\right)<\log (\epsilon/ 2)\\&\Longleftrightarrow&

We can therefore chose a $\delta'>0$ with the proberty $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon,$ when $|x-y|<\delta'$ and $x,y\in I$  (2) By setting $\delta=min({\delta',1})$ we can parry off (not sure if this is the right term at all...) the chosen $\epsilon$ for all $x,y\in \mathbb{R}$. Set $|x-y|<\delta$ - if both x,y $\in$ I, then (2) says that $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$. If $x\notin I$ we have $x>K+1$ or $x<-K-1$. If $x>K-1$ we get that $y>K$ because of $|x-y|<1$ whereas (1) gives that $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$. And if $x<-K-1$ we have that $y<-K$, which gives us that (1) is $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$ I am having trouble understanding the proof completely - I got the main idea, that something is uniformly continuous if the function behaves nicely.

1150478,Is this correct reasoning about Taylor series?,"Is the following correct reasoning about the Taylor series? I'm just trying to build some intuition but just want to make sure it's correct. If a function $f(x)$ has a power series representation it will be of the form:
$$ f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+ \text{ ... } \;\;\;\; \text{(1)}$$
Now we have written the coefficients as $a_k$, but we could also just as well write them as: 
$$ a_k=\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} $$
Of course to get this we need to know that $f(x)$ is infinitely differentiable. Since we found $a_0$ by letting $x=0$ therefore giving $f(0)=a_0$; similarly for $a_2$, we let $x=0$ for the derivative of $f(x)$, or $f'(x)=a_1$; and so on. Now according to this , if $f(x)$ has a power series representation then it must be of the form (I've just centred it around $0$):
$$ f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n \;\;\;\;\; \text{(2)}$$
Since effectively - assuming the function is infinitely differentiable - we've just re-written the general coefficients $a_k$ into an equally general form, but just in terms of the functions derivative. Thus if a function is infinitely differentiable then (2) is completely equivalent to (1). It's just written in this way so we have a mechanism for finding the coefficients (though it could also be done by setting $x=0$ and considering the various derivatives of $f(x)$ to find the coefficients manually). The reason I'm asking whether this is correct (though not necessarily rigorous, I'm trying to build more of an intuition), is because I was curious why $f(x)=\sin(x)$ could have a Taylor series representation that is entirely defined by the functions derivative at a single point . From the above reasoning it seems clear(er) that the derivatives at a point are just a mechanism for finding the coefficients of the polynomial. And since if there's a power series expansion for $\sin(x)$ it must be of this form; and I would expect there to exist such a power series that could equal the sine function (given enough terms). It just happens to be in the form of Taylor series (which we've defined in terms of derivatives at a point).","['power-series', 'complex-analysis', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"

1150544,What is the relationship between the Archimedean Property and Calculus?,"My textbook begin with a chapter dedicaded to the Real Numbers. It introduces firstly integers and rational numbers, then it introduces the irrational numbers, which appeared in the first place as a necessity of expressing the length of incommesurable line segments. To my understanding, all of this helps to introduce the notion of continuity of a variable, which is put into work when treating the continuity of a variable dependent of another variable (if we restrict ourselves to single-valued functions). The Archimedean Property is stated as follows (or as it is written in my textbook): Given any number $c > 0$, there exists  a natural number $n$, such that $n > c$. Given any positive number $\epsilon$, there always exists a natural
  number $n$ such that the inequality  $1/n < \epsilon$ is fulfilled. The last statement is the first one with $c = 1/\epsilon$. Although I understand what is meant by it (I think it can readily be proved by contradiction), what I'm not getting is how the Archimedean Property fits in the preparatory material preceding that dealing with supremum, infimum and then with continuity and limits.

1150955,Is the module of invariant differential forms of a Neron model of an abelian variety a projective module?,"Let $A$ be an abelian variety of dimension $d$ over a number field $K$. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be its Neron model over the ring of integers $O_K$. Let $\Omega_{\mathcal{A}/O_K}$ and $\Omega_{A/K}$ be the sheaves of differential forms of $\mathcal{A}$ and $A$ respectively. Then $\Omega_{A/K}$ and  $\Omega_{\mathcal{A}/O_K}$ are locally free $O_A$ and $O_{\mathcal{A}}$-modules respectively as $A$ and $\mathcal{A}$ are smooth group schemes. 
Furthermore, $\Omega_{A/K}$ is a free $O_A$-module, generated by invariant differential forms (cor 3, page 102, Neron Models, Bosch-Lutkebohmert-Raynauld). Let $\Omega_{\mathcal{A}/O_K}^{inv}(\mathcal{A})$ and $\Omega_{{A}/K}^{inv}({A})$ be the subset of invariant differential forms of $\Omega_{\mathcal{A}/O_K}(\mathcal{A})$ and $\Omega_{{A}/K}({A})$ respectively. I know that $\Omega_{{A}/K}^{inv}({A})$ is a $d$-dimensional $K$-vector space. Is it true that $\Omega_{\mathcal{A}/O_K}^{inv}(\mathcal{A})$ is a projective $O_K$-modules of rank $d$ and $\Omega_{\mathcal{A}/O_K}^{inv}(\mathcal{A}) \otimes_{O_K}K \simeq \Omega_{{A}/K}^{inv}({A})$ ?

1150990,Dimesion of a subspace subject to linear constraints,"Suppose $X$ is $n\times K$ with full column rank $K$ and $G$ is $q\times K$ with full row rank $q$. If $q<K$, how do I see that $\mathcal{L}\equiv\{Xb,b\in\mathbb{R}^K,Gb=0\}$ has dimension 
  $K-q$? Because $X$ has full column rank, its column space can be spanned by $K$ independent column vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The constraint $Gb=0$ imposes limits on the coefficients contained in $b$ when we form linear combinations of these $K$ vectors. But I don't know how to proceed formally.

1151007,If $a$ is an odd integer then $x^2+x-a = 0$ has no integer solutions,"I'm suppose to prove by contrapositive that if $a$ is an odd integer then the equation $x^2+x-a=0$ has no integer solution. By contrapositive: If the equation $x^2+x - a = 0$ has an integer solution then $a$ is an even integer. So I attempt to apply the quadratic formula and have this result $\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4a}} 2$. I have no idea how I'm suppose to get an integer solution from this, let alone an even solution. I've tried to multiply by the  conjugate but it gets really messy and I feel that I'm over-thinking it. Thanks for your help.","['quadratics', 'algebra-precalculus']"
1151017,Can a product of a Stein manifold and a compact manifold be again Stein?,"A Stein manifold is a manifold which is holomorphically separable and convex. It is well known that a product of two holomorphically convex (resp. Stein) manifolds is again holomorphically convex (resp. Stein). Also, compact complex manifolds automatically have the property of being holomorphically convex but they are not holomorphically separable, of course. This has led me to the following question: Given a Stein manifold $X$ and a compact complex manifold $Y$ (say of dimension $\geq 1$), when is $X \times Y$ Stein? Due to the remark made above, one only has to find a condition for $X \times Y$ to be holomorphically separable. Let $(x,y) \neq (x',y')$ be points of $X \times Y$. If $x \neq x'$, then everything is easy, as one could simply project onto $X$ and choose a separating function there. But what if $x = x'$ and $y \neq y'$? One cannot do the same for $Y$, as every holomorphic function on $Y$ is constant. So, when is it possible to separate points in this case? Never? Always? Does one have to add more conditions on $X$ and $Y$? Remark: I asked myself this question in the much more special situation where $X \subset \mathbb{C}$ is a disc and $Y = \mathbb{P}^1$, but I decided to pose the question in this more general fashion.","['complex-geometry', 'several-complex-variables', 'complex-analysis', 'compact-manifolds']"

1151040,Closed form of factorial and cascading power sum,"Consider the following sum: $$ \sum_{i =0}^{j} \left( \frac{(j-i)^ix^i \ln(x)^{(j-i)}\ln(x)^i}{(j-i)!i!} \right) $$ I can simplify the sum to: $$ \ln(x)^j\sum_{i =0}^{j} \left( \frac{(j-i)^ix^i}{(j-i)!i!} \right) $$ 
Furthermore I can observe that $$ \frac{1}{(j-i)!(i!)}  = \frac{1}{j!} \begin{pmatrix} j \\ i\end{pmatrix} $$ Thus: $$ \frac{\ln(x)^j}{j!}\sum_{i =0}^{j} \left( \begin{pmatrix}j \\ i \end{pmatrix}(j-i)^ix^i \right) $$ But I don't know how to go in for the kill.","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'generating-functions', 'hypergeometric-function', 'combinatorics']"
1151041,Is every invertible matrix a change of basis matrix?,"In the course that I am having, we are treating change of basis matrices as the matrices of the identity operation from one basis S to another basis say B . So, our instructor introduced a theorem : If A and B are similar, i.e., S −1 AS = B for an invertible matrix S , then they have the same characteristic polynomial. In particular, they have the same eigenvalues, det( A ) = det( B ) and Trace( A ) = Trace( B ). And hence came the question here... Is every invertible matrix a change of basis matrix? 
Every change of basis matrix is certainly invertible, is the converse true?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'inverse']"
1151059,Is this linear map bounded?,"This question asks to prove the following: Let $X$ and $Y$ be Banach spaces.  If $T: X \to Y$ is a linear map such that $f \circ T \in X^*$ for every $f \in Y^*$, then $T$ is bounded. The assumption that $Y$ is complete seems redundant, and the assumption that $X$ is complete is invoked only when applying the uniform boundedness principle (if $X$ is complete, it must be nonmeager by the Baire category theorem). So I'm trying to either prove that $T$ is still bounded if $X$ and $Y$ are arbitrary normed vector spaces (over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$), or else to find a counterexample that illustrates that $X$ must be complete. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

1151094,Maximum element of Perron vector,"Suppose $A$ is an entrywise nonnegative matrix that is symmetric, irreducible and has a zero diagonal. By Perron-Frobenius theorem, the spectral radius $\rho(A)$ is an eigenvalue and $A$ has, up to scaling, a unique entrywise positive eigenvector $v$ (i.e. the Perron vector ) for this eigenvalue. Let $r_i$ denotes the $i$-th row sum of $A$. In general, the maximum row sum of $A$ and the maximum entry of $v$ occur in different positions. For example, when
$$
A=\pmatrix{0&0&0&2\\ 0&0&3&2\\ 0&3&0&3\\ 2&2&3&0},
$$
the Perron vector is $(0.2067,\ 0.5236,\ 0.5908,\ 0.5780)^\top$. Therefore the maximum entry of the Perron vector is the third one, but the maximum row sum of $A$ occurs in the fourth row. However, in the computer experiments that I have carried out, this kind of exceptional cases are relatively infrequent. So, it seems that by imposing some mild conditions, one may force $\arg\max_i r_i=\arg\max_i v_i$. Now my question is: Under what conditions can we conclude that $\arg\max_i r_i=\arg\max_i v_i$? (Let's ignore the pathological cases where $\arg\max_i r_i$ or $\arg\max_i v_i$ are not unique.) This question arose when I was pondering what could happen if we apply Google style ranking to a weighted undirected graph. If $\arg\max_i r_i=\arg\max_i v_i$, there is no need to compute the Perron vector if I only want to find the highest-ranked member.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'nonnegative-matrices']"
