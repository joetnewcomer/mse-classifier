448684,Homework: Smooth mapping $f$ satisfying $f\circ f=f$,"This is an exercise in Mathematical Analysis by Zorich, in the subsection 12.1. Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ be a smooth mapping satisfying condition $f\circ f=f$ . $\quad$ a) Show that the set $f(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is a smooth surface in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . $\quad$ b) By what property of the mapping $f$ is the dimension of the surface determined? According to Zorich, the 'smooth surface' here has the same meaning as 'manifold' in Euclidean Space. So to prove this it's necessary to give it an atlas. But how to obtain the local charts? The only idea in my mind is to perform the differentiation to get the matrix equality: $$f'(f(x))\cdot f'(x)=f'(x)$$ without any progress. Thank you indeed if you can give me some help!",['analysis']

Fix $i$. It is known that a family $\Sigma_i$ of all $\mu_i^*$-measurable sets (i.e. all sets $C\subset [0,1]$ such that $\mu^*_i(A)=\mu^*_i(A\cap C)+\mu^*_i(A \setminus C)$ for all $A\subset [0,1]$) forms a $\sigma$-algebra. Moreover, $\mu_i^*|_{\Sigma_i}$ is a measure. Since $\mu_i^*$ is a metric outer measure, if $B([0,1])$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of all Borel subsets of $[0,1]$ then $B([0,1])\subset \Sigma_i$. Assume that the measures $\mu_1^*|_{B([0,1])},\mu_2^*|_{B([0,1])}$ are equal, i.e. $\mu_1^*|_{B([0,1])}=\mu_2^*|_{B([0,1])}$. Does it imply that $\mu_1^*=\mu_2^*$?",['measure-theory']

448756,Skorokhod Representation: $|X_n(t) - X_n(s)| \leq |t-s| \Rightarrow |X(t) - X(s)| \leq |t-s|$,"While working out problems from the Chapter on Skorokhod Representation from ""Stochastic processes"" by Richard Bass, Chapter 32, I came across this problem: Question: Suppose $X_n$ converges weakly to $X$ and each $X_n$ has the property that with probability $1$,
$$|X_n(t) - X_n(s)| \leq |t-s|, \quad s,t\leq 1$$ Prove that with probability $1$,
$$|X(t) - X(s)| \leq |t-s|, \quad s,t\leq 1$$ My Doubts and thoughts: The condition $s,t\leq 1$ probably should be $|s|,|t|\leq 1$. The condition indicates that the sample paths of $X_n$ are continuous (moreover Lipschitz). However as the space $C[0,1]$ is in the next chapter, I won't be using theorems from there. When talking about weak convergence of stochastic processes in general, does $X_n(t)\to^w X(t)$ mean for every $t$, $X_n(t)$ converges weakly to $X(t)$? Since I am comfortable only with the random variable versions, kindly hint to a good reference for this. I'm not sure how to apply Skorokhod theorem here. I thought of considering $\hat{X_n}$, but I am not sure if the property mentioned above for $X_n$ holds here. After all, $X_n =^d \hat{X_n}$. It somewhat feels like a limit has been taken on LHS. Since we only have weak convergence, I'm tempted to take the Skorokhod representation Theorem path. I'd appreciate it if someone could clarify 3) and 4). Any relevant hints are also welcome. Edit: Skorokhod Theorem: Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a complete separable metric space, $\Omega = [0,1]$, $\mathcal{B}$ the Borel Sigma algebra on $[0,1]$ and $\hat{\mathbb{P}}$ the Lebesgue measure on $\Omega$.

Then $\exists$ random variables $X_n$ and $X$ mapping $\Omega$ to $\mathcal{S}$ with law $\mathbb{P}$ such that $X_n \to X$ a.s. Equivalently, if $X_n \to^w X$, there exist random variables $\hat{X_n}$ and $\hat{X}$ mapping $\Omega$ to $\mathcal{S}$ with laws equal to $X_n$ and $X$ resp. such that $\hat{X_n} \to \hat{X}$ a.s.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'weak-convergence']"

First part: $2^n < \binom{2n}{n}$. The base $n = 1$ is trivial. Assume inductively that some $k$ satisfies our statement. The inductive step can be proved as follows. $2^k < \binom{2k}{k} \implies 2^{k+1} < 2\binom{2k}{k} = \frac{2(2k)!}{k!k!} = \frac{2(2k)!(k + 1)}{k!k!(k + 1)} = \frac{2(2k)!(k+2)}{(k+1)!k!}<\frac{(2k)!(2k+2)(2k+1)}{(k+1)!k!(k+1)} = \binom{2(k+1)}{k+1}$ Second part: $2^{2n} > \binom{2n}{n}$.

We can assume that for some $k$ our statement is satisfied and prove that inductive step as follows: $2^{2k} > \binom{2k}{k} \implies 2^{2k + 2} > 2^2\binom{2k}{k} = \frac{2\cdot2(2k)!}{k!k!} = \frac{2\cdot2(2k)!(k+1)(k+1)}{k!k!(k+1)(k+1)} = \frac{(2k)!(2k+2)(2k+2)}{(k+1)!(k+1)!} > \frac{(2k)!(2k+1)(2k+2)}{(k+1)!(k+1)!} = \binom{2(k+1)}{k+1}$ Is there a non-inductive derivation for the inequality?","['inequality', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

This is equivalent to finding the kernel of the homomorphism $f\colon \mathbb{Z}\rightarrow R$ which has the form $n\mathbb{Z}$. There are two cases. Suppose $f$ is injective, then only $f(0)=0$. Suppose now that $f$ is not injective, thus there exist $m,n\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(m)=f(n)$. This implies $f(m-n)=0$ thus $m-n$ is in the kernel and so is every multiple of $m-n$ thus $(m-n)\mathbb{Z}$ is the kernel (I think this is not 100% correct). Suppose now that $m-n$ is not a prime. Then there exist $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $m-n=ab$. $f(a)\neq 0\neq f(b)$ because then $a\mathbb{Z}$ or $b\mathbb{Z}$ would be the kernel because $a<m-n$ and also $b<m-n$.

Now to show we can't trisect $\theta$, we show that $\theta/3$ is not constructible by finding the irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb Q[x]$, whose root it is. By the angle tripling formula we have that, $\cos(3\theta)=4\cos^3(\theta)-3\cos(\theta) \Rightarrow $ $\cos(\theta)=4\cos^3(\theta/3)-3\cos(\theta/3)$. Here we see that $\cos(\theta)=6/7$. Thus we have, $6/7=4\cos^3(\theta/3)-3\cos(\theta/3)$. Take $x=\cos(\theta/3)$. So now we have, 
$28x^3-21x-6=0 \Rightarrow f(x)=28x^3-21x-6$ is a polynomial with root $\cos(\theta/3)$. But $f(x)$ is irreducible by Eisensteins Criterion with $p=3$, thus $[\mathbb Q[\cos(\theta/3)]: \mathbb Q]=3$ which is not a power of two.","['galois-theory', 'geometric-construction', 'proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra']"

I am wondering what is known about the distribution of $S(n,t,a)=\sum_{i=1}^n a^{X_i}$ where $a>0$. I don't think that the exact CDF and or PDF of $S(n,t,a)$ is known in the closed form.

In my particular scenario, $t\gg 1$ and $n=t^{\delta}$ for $\delta>0$, and I am interested in the lower bound on $\mathbf{P}(S(n,t,a)\geq b)$ where $a=e^{\frac{v}{2(v+u)}}$ and $b=wn\left(1+\frac{v}{u}\right)^{t/2}$ with $u>0$, $v>0$, and $w>0$.

What I tried First, divide both sides inside the expression for probability in $(1)$ by $n$ and use Jensen's Inequality to get rid of the summation (by first moving it along with $1/n$ factor into the exponential and then using the summation property of independent chi-squared random variables). We thus obtain a lower bound on $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n e^{\frac{v}{2(v+u)}X_i}\geq e^{\frac{v}{2(v+u)}X}$ where $X\sim\chi^2_{t}$. Then,
$$\mathbf{P}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n e^{\frac{v}{2(v+u)}X_i}\geq wn\left(1+\frac{v}{u}\right)^{t/2}\right)\geq\mathbf{P}\left(X\geq 2\left(1+\frac{u}{v}\right)\left(\frac{t}{2}\log\left(1+\frac{u}{v}\right)+\log w\right)\right)\tag{2}$$ and we can use the Central Limit Theorem to approximate the CCDF of $\frac{X-t}{\sqrt{2t}}$ by a standard normal distribution, which, in turn, has tight upper and lower bounds on CCDF.

449095,Combinatorics: 7 character passwords,"I am currently reviewing probability using Probability, Statistics, and Stochastic Processes by Peter Olofsson, and I have a dispute over the answer to problem #16 on page 67. The question is as follows: ""You are asked to select a password for a Web site. It must consist of five lowercase letters and two digits in any order. How many possible such passwords are there if (a) repetitions are allowed, (b) repetitions are not allowed."" My reasoning and answer for the following question are as follows: Since there must be $5$ lower case characters and $2$ digits the password is $7$ characters long: X-X-X-X-X-X-X For part (a) repetitions are allowed. Therefore there are $26^5$ lowercase characters that we can pick,  $10^2$ digits that we may pic. Now because The digits can be placed in any order we may pick the positions of the lowercase characters or the digits. The $5$ lowercase characters may be placed in $5$ of the $7$ slots $7C5 = 21$ ways. We don't need to do the calculation for the digits into the two remaining slots because they will automatically fall into the two remaining places. Meaning that there are $21 * 26^5 * 10^2 = 2.5 * 10^{10}$ passwords possible. For (b) repetitions are not allowed. Therefore there are $26P5$ selection of lowercase characters, and $10*9$ possible digits possible. The way we pick our possible positions are still the same $7C5 = 21 ways$. Meaning there are $21 * 26P5 * 10 * 9 = 1.49 * 10^{10}$. According to the back of the book: The answer For part (a) is $26^5 * 10^2 = 1.2 * 10^9$.
For part (b) is $26P5 * 10P2 = 7.1 * 10^8$. Notice that their answer is much smaller than mine because they do not multiply by a binomial coefficient.

449206,A Distinction Between Different Types of Partial Derivatives,"I recently noticed a subtle distinction between different types of partial derivatives: those that involve differentiation with respect to a parameter (that is, an   independent coordinate) those that involve differentiation with respect to a variable that is a function of a parameter or another variable. I don't recall this distinction being made in my calculus courses, and I'd like to check if my reasoning is valid and if there is a name for this observation. Consider two functions $f(x,y)$ and $g(z,t)$, where $x$, $y$, and $t$ are independent parameters but $z(t)$.  For example, $f(x,y)$ could represent that magnitude of a $2D$ magnetic field while $g(z,t)$ might represent the energy of a particle moving in a time-dependent potential. In the first case, the partial derivative $\partial{f}/\partial{x}$ is also a total derivative since $$
\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} + \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}}\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}}
$$ since $y$ is independent of $x$. In the second case, the partial derivative $\partial{g}/\partial{t}$ is more of a ""pure"" partial derivative since it only describes the explicit dependence of $g(z,t)$ on $t$, with the complete dependence being described by the total derivative $$
\frac{dg}{dt} = \frac{\partial{g}}{\partial{t}} + \frac{\partial{g}}{\partial{z}}\frac{dz}{dt}
$$ Clearly, the first case is just a special instance of the more general second case, but the first case exhibits some useful properties that are not found in general in the second case.  Most importantly in my mind, since $\partial{f}/\partial{x}$ is essentially a total derivative, any partial differential equation for $f(x,y)$ involving only derivatives in $x$ is in fact just an ordinary differential equation.  The same is not true for a partial differential equation for $g(z,t)$ involving only derivatives in $t$, unless the explicit form of $z(t)$ is known a priori. As a simple example, suppose $f(x,y)$ is unknown but the form of $f_x(x,y)$ is given.  We then have $$
\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} = \frac{df}{dx} = f_x(x,y)
\rightarrow
f(x,y) = \int f_x(x,y) dx
$$ I don't believe that this simple integration of a differential equation is possible in general in the second case.  This is certainly a substantive difference between the two type of partial derivatives, but I don't believe it was discussed in my undergraduate curriculum.","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"

449366,The national lottery,"When playing the lottery you have to pick 6 numbers out of 45 possibilities. Since the order of the numbers don't matter, the number of possible combinations for the jackpot (and hence the 6 correct numbers) is given by: $
\dbinom{45}{6} = C^6_{45} = \frac{45!}{(45-6)!6!} = 8145060
$ Assuming the numbers are picked at random out of a uniform distribution the chance of winning the jackpot is given by: $P(win) = \frac{1}{8145060}\approx 0.0000123 \%$ Now I can figure two possible scenarios: You play every week with the same numbers hoping that one day you'll get the jackpot. You play every week with a different set of numbers hoping that one day you'll get the jackpot. Now I was wondering if there is a difference in the chance of winning between the two methods. I was thinking that in the first case the chances of winning are larger because if you stick to your number the alternatives might run out. While if you switch you don't have the other options that become eliminated. But then I started wondering, because in the Monty Hall paradox the chances become larger if you switch. For the first case I believe the chance of winning in the $n^{th}$ drawing is simply calculated as: $1-(1-P(win))^n$ But in the second case I wouldn't know how to succeed.","['statistics', 'probability', 'order-statistics', 'probability-theory']"

\frac{1}{q}, & x=\frac{p}{q} \text{ in lowest terms, } 0<x<1 \end{array} \right.$$ Spivak (Calculus, 4th Ediiton, page 99) proved that for any number $a$, with $0<a<1$, the function $f$ approaches $0$ at $a$ as follows: To prove this, consider any number $\epsilon > 0$. Let $n$ be a natural number so large that $\frac{1}{n} \leq \epsilon$. Notice that the only numbers $x$ for which $|f(x)-0|\leq \epsilon$ could be false are:
  $$\frac{1}{2}; \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}; \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}; \frac{1}{5}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}; \dots ; \frac{1}{n}, \dots , \frac{n-1}{n}. $$ (If $a$ is rational, then $a$ might be one of these numbers.) However many of these numbers there may be, there are at any rate, only finitely many. Therefore, of all these numbers, one is closest to $a$; that is, $|\frac{p}{q}-a|$ is smallest for one $\frac{p}{q}$ among these numbers. (If $a$ happens to be one of these numbers, then consider only the values $|\frac{p}{q}-a|$ for $\frac{p}{q} \neq a$.) This closest distance may be chosen as the $\delta$. For if $0<|x-a|< \delta $, then $x$ is not one of
  $$ \frac{1}{2}, \dots , \frac{n-1}{n}$$
  and therefore $|f(x)-0| < \epsilon$. This completes the proof. My questions are: How do people follow this proof? I am lost starting at the second paragraph (""However many of these..."") I have gone through and understand (I think) the definition of a limit but still I can't follow what the author is trying to say and do (I do know the end product he wants to arrive at, which is to prove $f$ approaches $0$ at any $a$, where $0<a<1$.

I am sure there are people who understood a proof only after multiple readings. What did you do to improve your understanding? After further study, I am now stuck at ""For if $0<|x-a|< \delta $,..."". I am not convinced that after finding $\delta$, all $x$ that meets the condition $0<|x-a|<\delta$ will make $f(x)<\epsilon$.

Take $p_i$ to be the standard basis vector in $\mathbb{C}^n$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$, and $p_{n + 1} = (1, 1, \cdots, 1)$. Let $A$ be the $n \times n$ matrix constructed by taking the first $n$ of the $q$'s as column vectors, then we must have $G = A D$ for some diagonal matrix $D$, none of whose entries is $0$. Let $d$ be the vector consisting of the diagonal elements of $D$, and $v$ be the vector consisting of the coordinates of $q_{n + 1}$. Then the requirement that $G$ send $p_{n + 1}$ to $q_{n + 1}$ amounts to solving the equation $A d = v$. We see that $A$ must be invertible, and writing $d = A^{-1} v$ and using the cofactor expansion for $A^{-1}$, the condition that each $d_i$ be nonzero can be seen to be equivalent to the condition that the points other than $p_i$ are in general position: $A^{-1} v$ is equal, up to a scalar, to the vector of the $n$ relevant matrix determinants.

Surely there is some ""intrinsic"", perhaps ""algebraic"" feature of the exponential function (and many other functions as well, presumably) which ensures that sums of exponentials of linear transforms of $x$ again are exponentials only in very particular cases?","['functions', 'exponential-function', 'special-functions', 'real-analysis']"
449576,Does an analytic function maps a simple connected region into a simple connected region?,"Suppose $f$ is analytic, say, in $\mathbb{C}$, and suppose  $\Omega$ is a bounded simple connected open domain whose boundary we denote as $\Gamma$, then is $f(\Omega)$ also a simple connected domain whose boundary is $f(\Gamma)$? I think $f(\Omega)$ is also connected becasue the continuity of $f$ suffices,
but I'm not sure whether $f(\Omega)$ is simple connected and whether $f(\Gamma)$ will be the boundary of the domain. Sorry for the above too simple question... Now I put an additional condition on $f$, assuming that $f$ maps $\Gamma$ injectively into $f(\Gamma)$, then what can we say about $f(\Omega)$ ?
Or, what if $f$ is injective on $\overline{\Omega}$ ?","['general-topology', 'complex-analysis']"
449590,Can we infer from the support function of a convex domain $Q$ when the boundary $\partial Q$ admits nonvanishing curvature?,"Let $Q$ be a compact, convex domain in the plane, with smooth boundary $\partial Q$. We further assume that the origin is contained in $Q$. For a concrete example, let's take an ellipse $\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}\le1$. The support function of $Q$ is given by $\displaystyle h(\theta)=\sup_{\mathbf{q}\in Q}\;\mathbf{q}\cdot \langle\cos\theta,\sin\theta\rangle$. We can recover a convex domain from its support function by tracking the caustics of the supporting lines $L_\theta=\{h(\theta)\langle\cos\theta,\sin\theta\rangle+t\langle-\sin\theta,\cos\theta\rangle:t\in\mathbb{R}\}$ (Edit: More precisely, this gives the boundary of $Q$, not $Q$ itself.). So $h$ should be able to characterize $Q$. My questions are: is there some kind of characterization of $h$ such that the domain $Q$ is convex (strictly convex, respectively)? Assume $Q$ is already strictly convex. Is there any characterization of $h$ such that the boundary $\partial Q$ admits nonvanishing curvature? Thank you! :) Edit: as Harald's comment below, the resulting domain $Q=Q(h)$ is always convex, since it is the intersection of a family of convex domains--half planes.  Thank you Harald! Let's start with arbitrary $2\pi$-periodic, positive function $h$, and obtain a convex domain $Q=Q(h)$. Then we can reconsider the support function $g=g(Q)=g(Q(h))$ of $Q$, which might be different from $h$. This happens if $Q$ does not touch the boundary of some half plane. So we may restrict our attention to the class of faithful support functions, those satisfy the condition $g(Q(h))=h$.","['geometry', 'convex-analysis', 'support-function', 'plane-curves', 'convex-geometry']"
449592,"Evaluating the limit of a sequence given by recurrence relation $a_1=\sqrt2$, $a_{n+1}=\sqrt{2+a_n}$. Is my solution correct? [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Limit of the nested radical $x_{n+1} = \sqrt{c+x_n}$ (5 answers) Closed 7 years ago . Problem The sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is given by recurrence relation: $a_1=\sqrt2$, $a_{n+1}=\sqrt{2+a_n}$. Evaluate the limit $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n$. Solution Show that the sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is monotonic. The statement $$V(n): a_n < a_{n+1}$$
holds for $n = 1$, that is $\sqrt2 < \sqrt{2+\sqrt2}$. Let us assume the statement holds for $n$ and show that $V(n) \implies V(n+1)$. We have that $$a_n < a_{n+1}.$$ Adding 2 to both sides and taking square roots, we have that $$\sqrt{2+a_n} < \sqrt{2+a_{n+1}},$$ that is $a_{n+1} < a_{n+2}$ by definition. Find bounds for $a_n$. The statement $$W(n): 0 < a_n < 2$$ holds for $n=1$, that is $0 < \sqrt2 < 2$. Let us assume the statement holds for $n$ and show that $W(n) \implies W(n+1)$. We have that $$0 < a_n < 2.$$ Adding two and taking square roots, we have that $$0 < \sqrt2 < \sqrt{2+a_n} < \sqrt4 = 2.$$ The limit $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n$ exists , because $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a bounded monotonic sequence. Let $A = \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n$. Therefore the limit $\lim_{n \to\infty} a_{n+1}$ exists as well and $\lim_{n \to\infty} a_{n+1} = A$. (For $(n_k)_{k=1}^\infty = (2,3,4, \dots)$, we have that $(a_{n_k})_{k=1}^\infty$ is a subsequence of $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$, from which the statement follows.) We have that $a_{n+1} = f(a_n)$. That means that $A = \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = \lim_{n \to\infty} {f(a_n)} = f(\lim_{n \to\infty} a_n) = f(A) = \sqrt{2 + A}$. Solving the equation $A = \sqrt{2 + A}$, we get $A = -1 \lor A = 2$. Putting it all together, we get that $A = 2$, because the terms of the sequence are increasing and $a_1 > 0$.

Find the value of $n$ when the velocity is doubled from the 5th to the 10th second; find it also when the velocity is numerically equal to the acceleration at the end of the 10th second. I understand the velocity of this to be $v$ = $nt^{n-1}$ and the acceleration to be $a$ = $(n - 1)nt^{n - 2}$. The other exercises in this chapter barely compare to this one.
