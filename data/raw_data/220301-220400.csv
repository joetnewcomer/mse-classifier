4508099,"How many methods are there to find $\int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{d \theta}{a+b \cos \theta}, \textrm{ where }a>b>0$","When I deal with this simple integral, I found there are several methods. Now I share one of them. Letting $x\mapsto \pi-x $ yields $$I=\int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{d \theta}{a+b \cos \theta}=\int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{d \theta}{a-b \cos \theta}$$ Adding two versions together yields $$
\begin{aligned}
2 I &=2 a \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{d \theta}{a^{2}-b^{2} \cos ^{2} \theta} \\
&=4 a\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\sec ^{2} \theta}{a^{2} \sec ^{2} \theta-b^{2}} d \theta \quad \textrm{( By symmetry )}\\
&=4 a{\int_{0}^{\infty}} \frac{d t}{\left(a^{2}-b^{2}\right)+a^{2} t^{2}} \\
&=\frac{4}{\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}}\left[\tan^{-1} \left(\frac{at}{\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}}\right)\right]_{0}^{\infty} \\
&=\frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}}
\end{aligned}
$$ We can now conclude that $$
\boxed{I=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}}}
$$ Are there any other methods to deal with the integral?","['integration', 'improper-integrals', 'calculus', 'definite-integrals']"

4508255,Maximum number of $\pm 1$ valued vectors with pairwise negative inner product,"Let $S$ be a subset of $\{\pm 1\}^n$ such that $\forall x,y\in S$ ( $x\neq y$ ), $x\cdot y<0$ . Determine the upper bound of $|S|$ as precise as possible. (Thanks to the example from @kodlu, the proof is revised.) What I have already proved is $\mathrm{sup}|S|\leq n$ for odd $n$ , $\mathrm{sup}|S|\leq n/2$ for even $n$ , via probabilistic methods: For any possible $S$ , $m:=|S|$ . Let $X_i=1$ whenever the chosen pair differs in the $i$ -th entry, $X_i=0$ otherwise. The expectation of pairs in $S$ different in the $i$ -th entry is $$\mathbb E X_i=\dfrac{m_i(m-m_i)}{\binom{m}{2}}\leq \dfrac{m^2}{4\cdot m(m-1)/2}=\dfrac{m}{2(m-1)}.$$ Here $m_i$ is the number of $v\in S$ taking value $1$ in the $i$ -th entry. Since $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ is the total number of entries where pairs taking different values, we shall exclude those $m$ such that $$\mathbb E\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\leq\dfrac{mn}{2(m-1)}<\dfrac{n+1}{2}\quad \text{when } n \text{ is odd},$$ $$\mathbb E\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\leq\dfrac{mn}{2(m-1)}<\dfrac{n}{2}+1\quad \text{when } n \text{ is even}.$$ Therefore, $\mathrm{sup}|S|\leq n+1$ for odd $n$ , $\mathrm{sup}|S|\leq n/2$ for even $n$ .

4508285,Surface area of part of a sphere viewed through a window,"I'm trying to work out the proportion of the surface area of a sphere that would be visible through a circular aperture from a viewer at the centre of that sphere. If the aperture is centred on the axis of the sphere (i.e. the line normal to the centre of the aperture goes through the centre of the sphere), it's quite a simple problem: In this situation, the surface area of the visible bit of the sphere is the same as the surface area of a sphere cap and can be looked up or solved by integrating: $$
a = 2 \pi r^2 \int_0^\theta \sin\theta d\theta \\
= 2 \pi r^2 ( 1 - \cos\theta )
$$ The proportion of the sphere that is visible can then be found as: $$
ratio = \frac{a}{4 \pi r^2}
$$ hence: $$
ratio = \frac{1}{2} (1 - \cos \theta ) \\
= \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + (w/2)^2}} \right)
$$ Note that the solution here is only in terms of the known values ( $h$ & $w$ ). However, the problem gets a lot more complicated if we offset the aperture slightly: We can solve it geometrically quite easily if we assume it's another simple spherical cap, with the line shown in green as the circular plane that creates the cap.  However, this assumption isn't really valid as in this case the it isn't a plane (I think): it's a surface that is curved in at least one direction. I've been trying to formulate an integral that will allow me to solve this problem and get the ratio in terms of $h$ , $\delta$ and $w$ but I ended up with something that I couldn't figure out how to solve algebraically and which gave me nonsense-looking results when I tried to solve it numerically, so I suspect it's completely wrong. My attempt at formulating it created a new variable $\delta_p$ that represented the offset $\delta$ as you traverse around the axis shown with the purple line marked $h$ .  Viewing the aperture from above (with the yellow dot as the centre of the sphere and the blue circle representing the aperture): gives a definition for $\delta_p$ and I can then use the cosine rule to derive $\delta_p$ in terms of $\phi$ , $w$ and $\delta$ and then create a double integral over $\phi$ and $\theta$ to try to get the surface area.  That ended up with this monstrosity: $$
a = 2 \pi \int_0^{2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} \sqrt{h^2 + \left(\delta \cos\phi + \frac{w}{2} - \sqrt{\delta^2 \left( \cos^2\phi - 1 \right) + \frac{w^2}{4}}\right)^2} \mathrm{d}\phi \; \mathrm{d}\theta
$$ which, as I said I failed to solve algebraically and seemed to give me nonsense when solved numerically with a given $h$ , $\delta$ and $w$ (although I might have got the numerical solution wrong). Can anyone help me figure out how to formulate and hence solve this problem? Edit : to try to add a bit of clarity, I modelled the system in a 3D CAD package, with something like a cone (I'm not sure whether it actually classes as a cone) intersecting with a sphere: If I then perform a boolean intersection of those two things, I can draw a circular plane that intersects with two quadrant points of the spherical surface.  If it were a simple spherical cap, it would also intersect with the other two quadrant points, but as you can see if you look carefully at this image, it doesn't: That implies that it isn't a simple spherical cap but a more complex shape, hence my feeling that it needs an integral to solve it properly. The effect becomes more pronounced as $\delta$ increases:","['calculus', 'spheres', 'geometry']"
4508300,Why is addition on elliptic curves defined in this particular way?,"I am familiar with group theory and have encountered many different groups. I understand that the group operation can be defined many different ways and if it follows the group axioms, we are fine. However, I cannot wrap my head around why we define the addition of two points on elliptic curve such that we connect them with a line, find the third intersection of that line with the curve and then make reflection around the x axis. The result is the addition. Why does it make sense to add two points like this on the curve? What is the intuition behind this?

4508344,How do I - formally correct - convert discrete distributions into continous ones?,"I came across the following question when I was dealing with size-distribution of particles in a gas and was trying to formally convert the binned data to a continous size-distribution. Prior to measurements I divided the measuring range of particle sizes $x$ in $k$ subintervals $[x'_{k},x'_{k+1}]$ and bin sizes $\Delta x_k$ . Every particle within the k-th subinterval is considered to be of size $x_k$ .
The total amount of particles detected over the measuring range is given by $N_{tot}$ .
Consequently it is $N_{tot} = \sum_k N(x_k) := \sum_k N_k =  \sum_k \frac{N_k}{\Delta x_k}\Delta x_k$ where, $N(x_k) =  N_k$ is the amount counted within the k-th bin. Since bin sizes are not normalized, the particles counted within a bin is, per construction, dependent on bin width and $\frac{N_k}{\Delta x_k}$ represents a normalized view. My question is: How do I - formally correct - turn this discrete distribution into a continous one, as given below? $\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\partial N(x)}{\partial x} \,\operatorname{d}x = \int_0^{\infty} \,  \operatorname{d}N(x) = N_\text{tot}$ My approach was considering the limit of $k \to \infty$ or in other words $\Delta x_k \to 0$ , which however brought me to a similiar expression, but left the $N_k$ somehow untouched $\int_0^{\infty} \frac{N_k}{\partial x} \,\operatorname{d}x$","['data-analysis', 'statistics', 'probability']"
4508381,Proving the image measure $\mu_\psi$ to be $\sigma$-finite as part of the proof of a corollary of Radon-Nikodyn theorem,"Definition of image measure Let $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ be a measure space and $(Y,\mathcal{E})$ be a measurable space.

Radon-Nikodym theorem Let $(X,\mathcal{A})$ be a measurable space and  let $\mu$ and $\nu$ be $\sigma-$ finite measures over it . Let $\nu $ be absolutely continuous  with respect to $\mu$ . Then, there exists a measurable function $f\ge 0$ , unique a.e.  such that $\nu(A)=\int_A f d\mu, \forall A\in \mathcal {A}$ with $f$ called the R-N derivative Proposition Let $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{E},\lambda) $ be measure spaces. Let $\psi: X\to Y$ be a measurable function and $\mu_\psi$ denote the image measure of $\mu$ with respect to $\psi$ . Let $\mu$ and $\lambda$ be $\sigma$ -finite and $\mu_\psi$ absolutely continuous with respect to $\lambda$ with Radon-Nikodyn derivative $f_\psi=\frac{d\mu_\psi}{d\lambda}$ . Let $ g:Y\to \overline{ \mathbb{R} } $ be a measurable function. Then $\int_Xg\circ\psi d\mu=\int_Ygd\mu_\psi=\int_Y g f_\psi d \lambda$ In order to prove the above proposition,which follows directly from  the R-N theorem, I need $\mu_\psi$ to be $\sigma$ -finite. M y lecturer said that follows from $\mu $ and $\lambda$ being $\sigma$ -finite. But I am unable to prove it . Furthermore I've seen a number of posts where it says that the image measure of a $\sigma$ -finite measure is not sigma finite. But in this case there's also $\lambda$ that is $\sigma$ -finite, so  maybe that helps? How do I prove $\mu_\psi$ is sigma finite? My thoughts: Since $\lambda$ is $\sigma$ -finite, there exists  a sequence $\{B_n\}$ of $\mathcal{E}$ -measurable  functions such that $\lambda(B_n)<\infty$ and $\bigcup_n B_n=Y$ Since $\psi$ is measurable, the sequence $\psi^{-1}(B_n)$ is made of $\mathcal{A}$ -measurable sets such that $\bigcup_n\psi^{-1}(B_n)=\psi^{-1}(\bigcup_n B_n)=\psi^{-1}(Y)=X$ . So the $\psi^{-1}(B_n)$ covers X, but I don't think I can deduce from this that $\mu(\psi^{-1}(B_n))<\infty$ .How should I do it then?","['radon-nikodym', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-integral', 'real-analysis']"

  \Phi \colon E \to \mathbb{R}^{2, 2}, \quad \Phi ( \mathbf{X})

  a & b \\ c & d

a^{2} + cb & ab + db \\ ac + c d &  b c + d ^{2}

\implies \forall i, j \in \{ 1, 2\}\colon ( \mathbf{X}^{2})_{i, j} < 2 \epsilon^{2}

$$ choosing any $\epsilon < 1 / 2$ will assure that $\Phi ( \mathbf{X}^{2}) \in E$ for $\mathbf{X} \in E$ .

\\
& < 2 \!\left( 2 \epsilon ^{2} + 2 \epsilon ^{2}\right) = 8 \epsilon ^{2}

$$ and $\left\| \mathbf{X} - \mathbf{Y}\right\|_{\infty} < 4\epsilon $ meaning we simply have to choose some $\epsilon $ satisfying $$
\begin{align*}
2 \epsilon ^{2} < \epsilon  \iff \epsilon  < \frac{1}{2}

  \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + (a-2q\cos(2x)) y(x) = 0

This substitution strikes me as odd, as even if we allow $x \in \mathbb{C}$ , the domain of $z$ would only be the the punctured plane; this would seem problematic if we are to allow for initial conditions at $x=0$ . My question is the following: Does my concern make this substitution illegitimate? If the substitution is legitimate, does any sort of special handling of the $x=0$ case need to happen?

4508821,Properness of the map $\psi$ in the proof of Normal bundle is a manifold,"In Guillemin and Pollack's Differential Topology book while proving that the Normal bundle is a manifold they used the following argument: Given a manifold $Y$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^M$ choose locally an open set $\tilde{U}$ of $\mathbb{R}^M$ and a submersion $\phi: \tilde{U} \to \mathbb{R}^k$ such that $U = Y \cap \tilde{U} = \phi^{-1}(0)$ . Then $N(U)=N(Y)\cap U\times \mathbb{R}^M$ , is open is $N(Y)$ .
Now they took the map $\psi: U\times \mathbb{R}^k \to N(U), \psi(y,v)=(y,d\phi_y^tv)$ and claimed this to be an embedding from $U\times \mathbb{R}^k \to U \times \mathbb{R}^M$ .

For that purpose I just chose coordinates for $\tilde{U},U$ using the slice chart as in the above solution. Similarly I get a coordinate chart for $N(U)$ . Then the map $\sigma$ commutes with the charts to give the canonical submersion and hence is itself a submersion.

My question: In the proof of direction $\implies$ in Theorem 1.4, i.e., $f \in E^{X}$ is $\mu$ -measurable implies $f$ is $\mathcal{A}$ -measurable, the author uses the completeness of the measure space as follows ""...Furthermore, the completeness of $\mu$ shows that $f^{-1}(O) \cap N$ is a $\mu$ -null set..."" Could you explain how 1.5(i) implies 1.5(ii) in the case of non-complete measure space? I attach all related definitions and the proof of Theorem 1.4 below for reference and clarity. Let $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ be a complete, $\sigma$ -finite measure space; $(E,|\cdot|)$ a Banach space. Suppose $\mathrm{E}$ is a property that is either true or false of each point in $X$ .

""Almost every"" and ""almost everywhere"" are both abbreviated ""a.e."". We say $f \in E^{X}$ is ${\mu}$ -simple if $f(X)$ is finite, $f^{-1}(e) \in \mathcal{A}$ for every $e \in E$ , and $\mu\left(f^{-1}(E \backslash\{0\})\right)<\infty$ . We denote by $\mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ the set of all $\mu$ -simple functions from $X$ to $E$ . A function $f \in E^{X}$ is said to be ${\mu}$ -measurable if there is a sequence $\left(f_{j}\right)$ in $\mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ such that $f_{j} \rightarrow f \mu$ -almost everywhere as $j \rightarrow \infty$ . We set $$
\mathcal{L}_{0}(X, \mu, E):=\left\{f \in E^{X} ; f \text { is } \mu \text {-measurable }\right\} .

If there is a $\mu$ -null set $N \in \mathcal A$ such that $f\left(N^{c}\right)$ is separable, we say $f$ is ${\mu}$ -almost separable valued . Proof of Theorem 1.4. "" $\implies$ "" Suppose $f \in \mathcal{L}_{0}(X, \mu, E)$ . (i) There exist a $\mu$ -null set $N$ and a sequence $\left(\varphi_{j}\right)$ in $\mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ such that $$
\varphi_{j}(x) \rightarrow f(x) \quad(j \rightarrow \infty) \quad \text { for } x \in N^{c} . \quad \quad (1.1)
$$ By Proposition I.6.8, $F:=\bigcup_{j=0}^{\infty} \varphi_{j}(X)$ is countable and therefore the closure $\bar{F}$ is separable. Because of $(1.1)$ we have $f\left(N^{c}\right) \subset \bar{F}$ . Remark 1.3(b) now shows that $f$ is $\mu$ -almost separable valued. (ii) Let $O$ be open in $E$ and define $O_{n}:=\left\{y \in O\right.$ ; $\left.\operatorname{dist}\left(y, O^{c}\right)>1 / n\right\}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}$ . Then $O_{n}$ is open and $\bar{O}_{n} \subset O$ . Also let $x \in N^{c}$ . By (1.1), $f(x)$ belongs to $O$ if and only if there exist $n \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}$ and $m=m(n) \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}$ such that $\varphi_{j}(x) \in O_{n}$ for $j \geq m$ . Therefore $$
f^{-1}(O) \cap N^{c}=\bigcup_{m, n \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}} \bigcap_{j \geq m} \varphi_{j}^{-1}\left(O_{n}\right) \cap N^{c} . \quad \quad (1.2)
$$ But $\varphi_{j}^{-1}\left(O_{n}\right) \in \mathcal{A}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}$ and $j \in \mathbb{N}$ , because $\varphi_{j}$ is $\mu$ -simple. Hence (1.2) says that $f^{-1}(O) \cap N^{c} \in \mathcal{A}$ . Furthermore, the completeness of $\mu$ shows that $f^{-1}(O) \cap N$ is a $\mu$ -null set, and altogether we obtain $$
f^{-1}(O)=\left(f^{-1}(O) \cap N\right) \cup\left(f^{-1}(O) \cap N^{c}\right) \in \mathcal{A} .
$$ "" $\impliedby$ "" Suppose $f$ is $\mu$ -almost separable valued and $\mathcal{A}$ -measurable. (iii) We consider first the case $\mu(X)<\infty$ . Take $n \in \mathbb{N}$ .

If $\left\{e_{j} ; j \in \mathbb{N}\right\}$ is a countable dense subset of $f\left(N^{c}\right)$ , the collection $\left\{\mathbb{B}\left(e_{j}, 1 /(n+1)\right) ; j \in \mathbb{N}\right\}$ covers the set $f\left(N^{c}\right)$ , and thus $$
X=N \cup \bigcup_{j \in \mathbb{N}} f^{-1}\left(\mathbb{B}\left(e_{j}, 1 /(n+1)\right)\right) .

The continuity of $\mu$ from below and the assumption $\mu(X)<\infty$ then imply that there are $m_{n} \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}$ and $Y_{n} \in \mathcal{A}$ such that $$
\bigcup_{j=0}^{m_{n}} X_{j, n}=Y_{n}^{c} \quad \text { and } \quad \mu\left(Y_{n}\right)<\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} .

\varphi_{n}(x):=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}

e_{j} & \text { if } x \in X_{j, n} \backslash \bigcup_{k=0}^{j-1} X_{k, n} \text { for } 1 \leq j \leq m_{n}, \\
0 & \text { otherwise }.

$$ Obviously $\varphi_{n} \in \mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , and $$
\left|\varphi_{n}(x)-f(x)\right|<1 /(n+1) \text { for } x \in Y_{n}^{c} .

\mu\left(Z_{n}\right) \leq \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \mu\left(Y_{n+k}\right) \leq \frac{1}{2^{n}} \quad \text { for } n \in \mathbb{N}.
$$ It therefore follows from the continuity of $\mu$ from above that $Z:=\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} Z_{n}$ is $\mu$ -null. We now set $$
\psi_{n}(x):=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}
\varphi_{n}(x) & \text { if } x \in Z_{n}^{c}, \\
0 & \text { if } x \in Z_{n}.
\end{array}\right.
$$ Then $\left(\psi_{n}\right)$ is a sequence in $\mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ . Also there is for every $x \in Z^{c}=\bigcup_{n} Z_{n}^{c}$ an $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x \in Z_{m}^{c}$ . Since $Z_{m}^{c} \subset Z_{n}^{c}$ for $n \geq m$ , it follows that $$
\left|\psi_{n}(x)-f(x)\right|=\left|\varphi_{n}(x)-f(x)\right|<1 /(n+1) .
$$ Altogether, $\lim \psi_{n}(x)=f(x)$ for every $x \in Z^{c}$ . Therefore $f$ is $\mu$ -measurable. (iv) Finally, we consider the case $\mu(X)=\infty$ .

We had to find the probability of A having number of odd numbers more than twice of B. So if B had $r$ odd numbers, A could have odd numbers from $2r+1$ to $2021$ , hence the summation.

4508849,What is the lower bound on the symmetry difference of a number of sets?,"The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. The symmetric difference of the sets $A$ and $B$ is denoted by $A\operatorname {\triangle } B.$ Let $F_1$ , $F_2$ ,..., $F_k$ be finite sets. For simplicity of notation, we let $\triangle_{i=1}^{k}F_i=F_1\triangle F_2 \triangle \cdots \triangle F_k$ . Problem 1. Let $F_1$ , $F_2$ ,..., $F_n(n\ge 3)$ be finite sets such that each set $F_i$ has exactly $5$ elements and $|F_i\cap F_j|\le1$ for $i\ne j$ and $F_i\cap F_j \cap F_k=\varnothing$ for $i\ne j\ne k$ .  What is the lower bound on $|\triangle_{i=1}^{n}F_i|$ ? I guess that $9$ is the answer. Because $F_1\triangle F_2=9$ or $10$ . My feeling is that $|\triangle_{i=1}^{l}F_i|\ge |\triangle_{i=1}^{l-1}F_i|$ . But it lacks a rigorous derivation. When we change part of the numerical condition of Problem 1 to more general letters, the following query is posed. Problem 2. Let $F_1$ , $F_2$ ,..., $F_n (n\ge 3)$ be finite sets such that each set $F_i$ has exactly $m$ elements and $|F_i\cap F_j|\le s$ for $i\ne j$ and $F_i\cap F_j \cap F_k=\varnothing$ for $i\ne j\ne k$ .   What is the lower bound on $|\triangle_{i=1}^{n}F_i|$ ? My feeling is that the Inclusion–exclusion principle can be used, but I have not used it well enough to even answer the above two problems. The principle of inclusion–exclusion states that for finite sets $A_1, …, A_n$ , one has the identity $$
\left| A_1\cup \dots \cup A_n\right| = \sum_i \left| A_i\right|-\sum_{i<j} \left| A_i\cap A_j\right|+\sum_{i<j<k} \left| A_i\cap A_j\cap A_k\right|-\dots+(-1)^{n+1}\left| A_1\cap \dots \cap A_n\right|.
$$ So is there a nice formula for the symmetric difference  on sets like the one above? If there is, maybe my problem will be solved soon, too. Or even change the conditions, we get more general estimates. Maybe upper bounds and so on. From wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference . Suppose $ A=\left\{A_{1},A_{2},\ldots, A_{n}\right\}$ is a multiset and $n\geq 2$ . the symmetric difference of a collection of sets contains just elements which are in an odd number of the sets in the collection: $${\displaystyle \triangle A=\left\{b\in \bigcup A:\left|\{B\in A:b\in B\}\right|{\text{ is odd}}\right\}.}$$ Evidently, this is well-defined only when each element of the union ${\textstyle \bigcup A}$ is contributed by a finite number of elements of $A$ .

4508874,Conditional distribution function of one random variable given the sum of two,"I am trying to solve the following exercise in Probability Theory by A. Klenke (3rd version). Let X and Y be independent exponential random variables for some $\theta>0$ . Compute $P[X \leq x | X+Y]$ for $x\geq0$ . My solution is based only on the definition of conditional expectation and in particular on this property: if $\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{1}_A X]=\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{1}_A\mathbb{E}[X|\mathcal{F}]]$ for every $A \in \mathcal{F}$ then $\mathbb{E}[X|\mathcal{F}]$ is called a conditional expectation, where $X\in\mathcal{L}^1(\Omega, \mathcal{A},\mathbb{P})$ and $\mathcal{F}\subset \mathcal{A}$ are two $\sigma$ -algebras. Thus, for every $A\in \sigma(X+Y)$ : $\int_A \mathbb{1}_{X(\omega)\in[0,x]} d\mathbb{P}=\int_A\mathbb{1}_{X(\omega)\in[0,x]} d(\mathbb{P}\circ(X \times (X+Y))^{-1})=\int_A\int_0^t\mathbb{1}_{t-y\in[0,x]} \theta e^{-\theta(t-y)}\theta e^{-\theta y}dydt=\int_A \int_{t-x}^{t} \theta^2e^{-\theta t}dydt=\int_A \frac{x}{t} t\theta^2e^{-\theta t}dt = \int_A \frac{x}{T} d\mathbb{P}$ . So I conclude: $P[X \leq x | X+Y] = \frac{x}{X+Y}$ . In the second equality I obtained the density of $(X,T)$ , where $T=X+Y$ , in this way: $f_{X,T}(x,t)=f_{X,Y}(t-y,y)=f_X(t-y)f_Y(y)$ by the independence property. Is this correct?

4508932,Multiclass Linear Discriminant Analysis,"This question is based on the Multiclass Linear Discriminant Analysis (MLDA) describe in Lectures slides by Olga Veksler , which is a generalization of Fisher's Linear Discriminant. My use in MLDA is to reduce dimensionality and transform multi-dimensional data into ""well separated"" clusters in lower dimensions. Short review of the theory and mathematical formalism: Suppose we have $N$ samples in $C$ classes or clusters. Each have $N_c$ samples which are $d$ -dimensional, that is $x^{(c)}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ for $c = 1,...,C$ and $i = 1,...,N_c$ . Each class $\omega_c$ have mean and covariance: $$
\mu_c = \frac{1}{N_c} \sum_{x_i \in \omega_c} x_i, \qquad S_c = \frac{1}{N_c}\sum_{x_i \in \omega_c} (x_i - \mu_c) (x_i - \mu_c)^T
$$ The ""average"" scatter within classes is defined as $$
S_w = \sum_{c=1}^C S_c \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}
$$ and the scatter between classes is defines as $$
S_b = \sum_{c=1}^{C} N_c (\mu_c - \mu)(\mu_c - \mu)^T \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}
$$ where $\mu = (1/N)\sum_{j=1}^n x_j$ is the mean over all the samples.
In order to find the best separating dimensionality reduction, given by projection $y = W^T x$ , we want to maximize the following objective function: $$
J(W) = \frac{\det(W^T S_b W)}{\det(W^T S_w W)}
$$ The idea is to maximize the scatter between while minimizing the scatter within each class. Differentiating the objective function with respect to $W$ one gets the following generalized eigenvalue problem: $$
S_b W_c = J(W_c) S_w W_c = \lambda S_w W_c
$$ where $J(W_c) \in \mathbb{R}$ is a scalar eigenvalue. From matrix rank consideration one can show that there are at most $C-1$ non-zero eigenvectors. The projection weights are the $C-1$ eigenvectors corresponding to the $C-1$ largest eigenvalues. We stack the eigenvectors in a matrix and get the weight matrix $$
W = \left[ W_1 | ... | W_{C-1} \right] \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times (C-1)}
$$ Then the projection is $y = W^T x$ (verify dimensions: $(C-1) \times 1 = ((C-1) \times d) \cdot (d \times 1)$ ). This projection is called LDA or MDA. The new means after LDA are given by $\tilde{\mu}_c = W^T \mu_c$ and the covariances after LDA are given by $$
\tilde{S}_c = W^T S_c W \in \mathbb{R}^{(C-1) \times (C-1)}
$$ Here I have few questions: Is the after-LDA covariance matrix of each class, $\tilde{S}_c$ is diagonal? The $W^T S_c W$ is sort of a whitening transformation and if $W^T = W^{-1}$ it is diagonalization. How to solve the generalized eigenvalues problem $S_b v = \lambda S_w v$ ? If I tried different algorithms in Python such as SciPy's eig or eigh functions with D, V = eig(S_b, S_w) , or inverting $S_w$ and then solve $S_r v = S_w^{-1} S_b v = \lambda v$ and D, V = eigh(S_r) , or trying SVD: V, D, Vh = svd(S_r) I get different eigenvalues and eigenvactors. How to use SVD to solve the generalized eigenvalues problem? If I use sklearn LDA class I also get different results, but the algorithm therein is more complicated and include shrinkage covariance estimator, and priors terms. The best results were obtained with from scipy.linalg import pinv, eig, eigh

# Solving for eigenvectors by inverting cov_within
inv_cov_within = pinv(cov_within)
D, V = eigh(inv_cov_within @ cov_between)
    
# Sort according to eigenvalues in descending order
idx = np.argsort(np.real(D))[::-1]
D = D[idx]
W = V[:, idx]

# The weights are (n_features, n_classes-1)
weights = W[:, 0:n_classes-1] I used pinv because the scatter within may not be invertible (e.g. when $d >> N$ , more dimensions than samples), so I use pseudo-inverse. Using SVD may also solve this issue (how?). Hypothesis for 1:
The class covariances are diagonal only if $\forall c : S_c = S$ , i.e. all the classes have the same covariance matrix.

4509263,Frattini subgroup of a simple non abelian group,"How do I calculate the Frattini subgroup of a simple non-abelian group $G$ ? My efforts: Well, it's a well know fact that $\Phi(G) \trianglelefteq G$ because $\Phi(G)$ is a characteristic subgroup. Thus $\Phi(G) = 1$ or $\Phi(G) = G$ due to the simplicity of $G$ . I'm wondering if the hypothesis ' $G$ is non-abelian' helps me decide which of the two possibilities above actually occurs. Since $G$ is a simple non-abelian group, we obtain $Z(G)=1$ (consequently $G$ is not nilpotent) and $G' = G$ . How do I use this to prove what I want?

4509291,Question on the proof of the Hahn Decomposition,"I am reading this proof of the Hahn decomposition from Billingsley Probability and Measure. The Hahn Decomposition Theorem 32.1. For any additive set function $\varphi$ , there exist disjoint sets $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ such that $A^{+} \cup A^{-}=\Omega, \varphi(E) \geq 0$ for all $E$ in $A^{+}$ , and $\varphi(E) \leq 0$ for all $E$ in $A^{-}$ . A set $A$ is positive if $\varphi(E) \geq 0$ for $E \subset A$ and negative if $\varphi(E) \leq 0$ for $E \subset A$ . The $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ in the theorem decompose $\Omega$ into a positive and a negative set. This is the Hahn decomposition. Proof. Let $\alpha=\sup [\varphi(A): A \in \mathscr{F}]$ . Suppose that there exists a set $A^{+}$ satisfying $\varphi\left(A^{+}\right)=\alpha$ (which implies that $\alpha$ is finite). Let $A^{-}=\Omega-A^{+}$ . If $A \subset A^{+}$ and $\varphi(A)<0$ , then $\varphi\left(A^{+}-A\right)>\alpha$ , an impossibility; hence $A^{+}$ is a positive set. If $A \subset A^{-}$ and $\varphi(A)>0$ , then $\varphi\left(A^{+} \cup A\right)>\alpha$ , an impossibility; hence $A^{-}$ is a negative set. It is therefore only necessary to construct a set $A^{+}$ for which $\varphi\left(A^{+}\right)=\alpha$ . Choose sets $A_{n}$ such that $\varphi\left(A_{n}\right) \rightarrow \alpha$ , and let $A=\cup_{n} A_{n}$ . For each $n$ consider the $2^{n}$ sets $B_{n i}$ (some perhaps empty) that are intersections of the $B_{n}=\left[B_{k=1}: 1 \leq i \leq 2^{n}\right]$ of these sets partitions $A$ . Clearly, $A_{k}$ . The collection $\mathscr{B}_{n}=\left[B_{n i}: 1 \leq i \leq 2^{n}\right]$ of these sets partitions $A$ . Clearly, $\mathscr{B}_{n}$ refines $\mathscr{B}_{n-1}$ :
Let $B_{n j}$ is contained in exactly one of the $B_{n-1, i}$ .
Let $C_{n}$ be the union of those $B_{n i}$ in $\mathscr{B}_{n}$ for which $\varphi\left(B_{n i}\right)>0$ . At this point of the proof, I have a question. Why couldn't I conclude the theorem by constructing the set $A=\bigcup_n C_n$ becuase we have $\alpha =  \lim_{n\to \infty}\varphi(A_n)\leq \lim_{n\to \infty}\varphi(C_n)$ ? The proof goes on to say Since $A_{n}$ is the union of certain of the $B_{n i}$ , it follows that $\varphi\left(A_{n}\right) \leq \varphi\left(C_{n}\right)$ . Since the partitions $\mathscr{B}_{1}, \mathscr{B}_{2}, \ldots$ are successively finer, $m<n$ implies that $\left(C_{m} \cup \cdots \cup\right.$ $\left.C_{n-1} \cup C_{n}\right)-\left(C_{m} \cup \cdots \cup C_{n-1}\right)$ is the union (perhaps empty) of certain of the sets $B_{n i}$ ; the $B_{n i}$ in this union must satisfy $\varphi\left(B_{n i}\right)>0$ because they are contained in $C_{n}$ . Therefore, $\varphi\left(C_{m} \cup \cdots \cup C_{n-1}\right) \leq \varphi\left(C_{m} \cup \cdots \cup C_{n}\right)$ , so that by induction $\varphi\left(A_{m}\right) \leq \varphi\left(C_{m}\right) \leq \varphi\left(C_{m} \cup \cdots \cup C_{n}\right)$ . If $D_{m}=\cup_{n=m}^{\infty} C_{n}$ , then by Lemma 1 (take $\left.E_{v}=C_{m} \cup \cdots \cup C_{m+v}\right) \varphi\left(A_{m}\right) \leq \varphi\left(D_{m}\right)$ . Let $A^{+}=\cap_{m=1}^{\infty} D_{m}$ (note that $\left.A^{+}=\lim \sup _{n} C_{n}\right)$ , so that $D_{m} \downarrow A^{+}$ . By Lemma $1, \alpha=\lim _{m} \varphi\left(A_{m}\right)$ $\leq \lim _{m} \varphi\left(D_{m}\right)=\varphi\left(A^{+}\right)$ . Thus $A^{+}$ does have maximal $\varphi$ -value. but frankly, I am confused as to what the motivation is for going further as they have done. We want intuitively, the biggest possible set with positive signed measure. Why couldn't I just find this by unioning all the little partitions which have positive measure i.e. unioning the $C_n$ together?","['conditional-probability', 'probability-distributions', 'analysis', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

4509374,Proof that there is no injection from $\mathcal{P}(A)$ to $A$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : There exists an injection from $X$ to $Y$ if and only if there exists a surjection from $Y$ to $X$. (3 answers) Closed 1 year ago . I am trying to follow the proof from Munkres that for any set $A$ , there is no injection from $\mathcal{P}(A)$ to $A$ . Munkres's approach is to note that for any nonempty set $B$ , the result is equivalent to the statement that there is no surjection from $B$ to $\mathcal{P}(B)$ . I am very comfortable with the proof of Cantor's theorem, so I'm trying to prove only two things: (a) this result still holds when $A = \emptyset$ and (b) that for $A \neq \emptyset$ , the result is implied by the lack of a surjection from $A$ to $\mathcal{P}(A)$ . Here are my attempts. I am a bit puzzled by (a). If $A = \emptyset$ , then $\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\emptyset\}$ . There is no function from $\mathcal{P}(A)$ to $A$ in that case and therefore no injection. Is it as simple as that? Munkres doesn't treat this case. I'm assuming because it is considered ""trivial"" and an edge case. As for (b): I'll try to prove the exact statement Munkres quoted. The statement is: Suppose $B \neq \emptyset$ and there exists no surjection from $B$ to $C$ . Then there exists no injection from $C$ to $B$ . I think the standard proof is by contraposition, or at least that's my intuition. So let's suppose there exists an injection $f: C \to B$ . It follows that $f$ admits a left inverse $g: B \to C$ so that $g \circ f = \mathrm{id}_C$ . But then $g$ admits a right inverse, $f$ , so $g$ is surjective. By contraposition, if there is no such surjection $g$ , then there is no injection $f$ . I'm taking for granted the fact that a function admits a left inverse if and only if it is injective and a right inverse if and only if it is surjective.

4509727,Hodge star operator : inner product of $k$-forms independent of orthogonal frames,"I'm trying to work out John Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds problem 16-18 about the definition of Hodge star operator, but mainly subproblem (a), I can prove the rest of them assuming the property of (a). Problem (a) asks you to prove that for each $k=1,\cdots n$ , the Riemannian metric $g$ uniquely determines an inner product on $\Lambda^k T^*_p M$ which satisfies $$\langle \omega^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \omega^k, \tau^1 \wedge \cdots\tau^k \rangle=\mathrm{det}(\langle(\omega^i)^\sharp,(\tau^j)^\sharp\rangle)$$ where $\omega^1, \cdots, \omega^k,\tau^1, \cdots, \tau^k$ are covectors at $p$ . The hint is to define inner product locally by declaring $\{\varepsilon^I|_p :I$ is increasing $\}$ to be an orthonormal frame, whenever $(\varepsilon^i)$ is the coframe dual to a local orthonormal frame. Here is what I tried following the hint: Every $k$ -form locally can be uniquely written as $\alpha=\sum_{I \nearrow}a_I\varepsilon^I$ where $I$ is an increasing multi-index of length $k$ . If we have another $k$ -form $\beta=\sum_{I \nearrow}b_I\varepsilon^I$ , we define $$\langle\alpha,\beta\rangle=\sum_{I \nearrow}a_Ib_I$$ We must prove the above definition is independent of the choice of coframe: If $(\varepsilon^i)$ and $(\eta^i)$ are two coframes, each of which is dual to an orthonormal frame, $\alpha=\sum_{I \nearrow}a_I\varepsilon^I=\sum_{I \nearrow}a_I^\prime\eta^I$ , $\beta=\sum_{I \nearrow}b_I\varepsilon^I=\sum_{I \nearrow}b_I^\prime\eta^I$ , then $\sum_{I \nearrow}a_Ib_I=\sum_{I \nearrow}a_I^\prime b_I^\prime$ . Suppose $$(\varepsilon^1,\cdots,\varepsilon^n)=(\eta^1,\cdots,\eta^n)\begin{pmatrix} q^1_1 & \cdots 
 & q^n_1 \\ \vdots 
& &\vdots \\q^1_n &\cdots &q^n_n\end{pmatrix}$$ where the matrix $Q=(q^j_i)$ is orthogonal, therefore $\varepsilon^k=\eta^i q^k_i$ . Substituting $\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge\varepsilon^{i_k}$ , we have $$\alpha = \sum_{I \nearrow}a_I^\prime\eta^I=\sum_{I \nearrow}a_I(\sum^n_{j=1}\eta^j q^{i_1}_j\wedge\cdots \wedge \sum^n_{j=1}\eta^j q^{i_k}_j)$$ Fix an multi-index $L=(l_1,\cdots, l_k)$ and compare the coefficients of $\eta^L$ , we have $$a_L^\prime=(\sum_{I \nearrow}a_I \sum_{\sigma \in S_k}(-1)^{\mathrm{sgn}\sigma}q^{i_{\sigma(1)}}_{l_1}\cdots q^{i_{\sigma(k)}}_{l_k})=\sum_{I \nearrow}a_I Q(L,I)$$ where $Q(L,I)$ denotes the minor of $Q$ of row $L$ and column $I$ . By the same argument we have $b_L^\prime=\sum_{I \nearrow}b_I Q(L,I)$ . So finally what we have to prove is (if I did't make calculation mistakes) given an orthogonal matrix $Q$ and real numbers $a_I,b_I$ , $$\sum_{I \nearrow} a_I b_I=\sum_{(I \nearrow}(\sum_{J \nearrow}a_J Q(I,J))(\sum_{J \nearrow}b_J Q(I,J)))$$ which seems like a tricky linear algebra problem.

4509831,Cube standing on a corner,"Cube standing on a corner This question has arisen from this post and the picture and the insights have been taken from the answers mentioned there. $\quad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$ In the above picture, a cube is standing on one of its corners. Let the cone lie on a $xz \text{ plane}$ and assume $y$ -axis (the red line) passes through the centre of the cone and through one of the body diagonals of the cube. Now for the cube, imagine a plane passing though the points $QS$ and parallel to the $xz \text{ plane}$ . What I thought : I thought, after looking at a dice for some time, that the $3$ vertices $QST$ would indeed form a triangle but the $3^{rd}$ vertex will be at a different height (not in the same plane), like the triangle $QST'$ below. So when a $xz \text{ plane}$ will cut the cube, what we'll get will be some polygon which with my level of understanding and imagination wasn't possible to fathom then. $\qquad$ Image on the Left: Front View; $\qquad\qquad\qquad$ Image on the Right: Top View What it turned out to be : It turned out that all the $3$ vertices, $QST$ indeed lie on single $xz \text{ plane}$ , like $QST$ above, and thus form a triangle. Similarly it's true for the $3$ vertices above these (the vertices $U,V,W$ ). And add to that all the $4$ $xz \text{ planes}$ upon which all these vertices lie are at intervals of equal height! I want to know that : How can we know whether a triangle forms and not some other polygon for the vertices $Q,S,T$ on the $xz \text{ plane}$ parallel to cone's base and passing through $1$ or more of the $3$ vertices (which may be an unfamiliar figure, maybe a pentagon or some quadrilateral, as below)? Whether all the 3 vertices of the cube will lie on a plane parallel to $xz \text{ plane}$ and not on 2 planes parallel to $xz \text{ plane}$ How to determine the height of these $xz \text{ planes}$ from one another? How will one calculate the centre and the radius for the obtained polygon in point 1?

4509843,Efficient way to rotate through partitions with subsets of size three,"I'm looking to generalize the following problem and solution. Problem 0: You have a group of $n$ people that need to all meet each other in pairs (e.g. maybe they have to all shake hands or something) through the course of $n-1$ time slots. Describe an effective way to organize doing this. (For simplicity, assume $n$ is even.) Solution 0: Create a line of $n/2$ pairs of chairs facing each other. Have everyone take a seat and designate one person to be the anchor. For the first time period, each person pairs off with the person sitting in the chair opposite of them. Each time a time period is over, the group rotates in the following way: everyone except the anchor moves to the seat immediately to their right (or if in the farthest right seat, then around to the farthest left seat on the opposite side), skipping over the anchor if/when needed. The anchor remains in the same seat the whole time. In this way, after $n-1$ iterations, every person will have paired off with every other person exactly once. (Note: If $n$ is odd, consider the case of $n+1$ where the extra is a ""dummy"" person whose partner is then ""on break"".) So, the actual question/problem I have is how to do this with triples instead of pairs. Problem: You have a group of $n$ people that need to all meet each other in triples through the course of $(n-1)/2$ (??) time slots. Describe an effective way to organize doing this. (For simplicity, assume $n$ is odd and divisible by 3.) Clarification: Each pair of people needs to meet once. So once two people have been in a triple together, ideally they are not in another triple together later. (And again it might not be possible to avoid this happening, in which case minimizing such instances is preferred.) As indicated by the (??), I'm not sure it can be done in $(n-1)/2$ periods. If not, then the minimal number of time periods (whatever that may be) is preferred. In particular, I'm looking for a description of an efficient rotation process once the initial groups of 3 have been formed.","['combinatorial-designs', 'combinatorics']"

Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are nonnegative and that $\int_{A} f d \mu \leq \int_{A} g d \mu$ for all $A$ in $\mathscr{F}$ . If $\mu$ is $\sigma$ -finite, there are $\mathscr{F}$ -sets $A_{n}$ such that $A_{n} \uparrow \Omega$ and $\mu\left(A_{n}\right)<\infty$ .

The same would happen for the reverse ( $x$ with a low value and $y$ with a high value) If $x$ is high and $y$ is high, $f(x,y)$ will also be high; it would be useful that the values resulted would be higher than those from point $(1)$ .

4510214,How to compute Push Forward Measures?,"Given the measure space $([0,1],\mathcal{B},\lambda|_{[0,1]})$ , I am asked to find the push forward measure $\mu$ of the measurable function $f:[0,1]\to\Bbb{R}$ given by $f(x)=x^{3}$ . My question is that how do I explicitly calculate $\mu(A)$ for any Borel set in $[0,1]$ ? Now I know that $\mu(A)=\lambda(f^{-1}(A))$ . That is $\lambda(\{x\in[0,1]:x^{3}\in A\})$ . Now I don't understand how to compute the right hand side for arbitrary Borel sets $A$ . But I do know how to find $\mu(a,b)$ ( or $\mu((a,b])$ ) for any interval $(a,b]$ . That is simply $\lambda(\{x\in[0,1]: a<x^{3}\leq b\}) = \lambda(\{x\in[0,1] : \sqrt[3]{a}<x\leq \sqrt[3]{b}\}) = \lambda\bigg((\sqrt[3]{a},\sqrt[3]{b}]\bigg) = \sqrt[3]{b}-\sqrt[3]{a}$ . I mention this because, I know that the collection $\{(a,b]\subset [0,1]\}$ generates the Borel Sigma Algebra on $[0,1]$ .  So intuitively , I can recover $\mu(A)$ for any Borel set $A$ but how(is it possible?) to calculate explicitly what $\mu(A)$ will be?(If it is possible) Also , I saw this post and it seems that the issue is related to that of a pdf of a random variable . So if we write it as $\displaystyle\mu(A)=\int_{A\cap[0,1]}\dfrac{1}{3x^{\frac{2}{3}}}d\lambda$ then we seem to be able to compute it. But it is still not explicitly possible to calculate this integral over all Borel sets $A$ right? . So what is the correct description? I also read about the Caratheodory's Extension Theorem which also allows me to extend $\mu$ from the subsets of the form $(a,b]$ to any Borel set but it still does not give an explicit description. Edit: I am sorry if I could not explain myself properly. What I am trying to ask is: Is there a complete description of $\mu(A)$ in terms of $\lambda|_[0,1](A)$ ? . So if you were asked to ""find the push forward measure"" then what answer and in what form  would you give or would consider a ""valid"" one?","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'borel-measures', 'pushforward', 'measurable-functions']"

first $N$ digits and the number formed from its last $N$ digits. For example, $1020$ is ""interesting"" (divisible by $10$ and $20$ ) and 2005 is not. Tyomitch wants to know how many ""interesting"" 2N-digit numbers
exist. You are to help him. Despite being a programming problem, it actually has a closed form formula solution, I tried to derive it, but something went wrong since it gives wrong answers for considerably small N. The solution: Let $m = a\cdot 10^n + b$ , where $n$ is $n$ mentioned in the problem statement and $a, b, n, m \in \mathbb{N}$ . $a$ and $b$ are gonna play the role of those two numbers of which we are supposed to divide i.e. $a \mid m$ and $b \mid m$ . So we also need to put some constraints on them, like we can't have leading zeros in number $m$ and we also can't have zeros in $a$ or $b$ since we would have divided by zero. So, firstly let do these constraints: $$10^{n - 1} \leq a < 10^n$$ $$1 \leq b < 10^n$$ Now let's do some observations: $$a \mid m \Leftrightarrow m = a \cdot v$$ $$m = a \cdot 10^n + b \Leftrightarrow m - a \cdot 10^n = b \Leftrightarrow a \cdot v - a \cdot 10^n = b\Leftrightarrow a(v - 10^n) = b  \Leftrightarrow a \mid b$$ $$a \mid b \Leftrightarrow b \geq a$$ Then we have more tight constraints for b: $$10^{n - 1} \leq a \leq b < 10^n$$ $$a \mid b \Leftrightarrow b = a \cdot k, \text{ where } k < 10$$ Back to the original equation: $$m = a \cdot 10^n + b \Leftrightarrow \frac{m}{b} = \frac{a \cdot 10^n + b}{b} 
\Leftrightarrow \frac{m}{b} = \frac{a \cdot 10^n}{a\cdot k} + 1 \Leftrightarrow \frac{m}{b} = \frac{10^n}{k} + 1 \Leftrightarrow k \mid 10^n \text{  since LHS is integer}$$ There are 3 corner cases: $$n = 1, k \in \{1, 2, 5\}$$ $$n = 2, k \in \{1, 2, 4, 5\}$$ $$n \geq 3, k \in \{1, 2, 4, 5, 8\}$$ I'll be looking only to the third case since I'm looking for general formula. Lemma:
Amount of multiples of $k$ on $[1; n]$ segment is equal to $\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\rfloor$ Let's denote $p_{k}(n)$ = $\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\rfloor$ i.e. amount of multiples of $k$ on $[1; n]$ and $p_k(a, b)$ - amount of multiples of $k$ on $[a; b]$ i.e. $p_k(a, b) = p_k(b) - p_k(a - 1)$ . Since we have those constraints: $$10^{n - 1} \leq a < 10^n$$ $$10^{n - 1} \leq b < 10^n$$ $$10^{n - 1} \leq a\cdot k < 10^n$$ We need to count amount of multiples of $k$ in $[10^{n - 1}, 10^{n} - 1]$ segment for all possible $k$ i.e. $k \in \{1, 2, 4, 5, 8\}$ and that's gonna be the answer. $p_k(10^{n - 1} - 1, 10^{n} - 1) \Leftrightarrow p_k(10^{n - 1}, 10^n)$ for $n \geq 4$ , since $10^n$ adds one mupltiply for each possible divisor $(1, 2, 4, 5, 8)$ . Same goes for $10^{n - 1}$ negating the added divisors. Therefore the answer for amount of ""interesting"" numbers for given $n$ is: $$p_1(10^{n - 1}, 10^n) + p_2(10^{n - 1}, 10^n) + p_4(10^{n - 1}, 10^n) + p_5(10^{n - 1}, 10^n) + p_8(10^{n - 1}, 10^n) = $$ $$= \frac{1}{1}10^n - \frac{1}{1} 10^{n - 1} + \frac{1}{2}10^n - \frac{1}{2} 10^{n - 1} + \frac{1}{4}10^n - \frac{1}{4} 10^{n - 1}+ \frac{1}{5}10^n - \frac{1}{5} 10^{n - 1}+ \frac{1}{8}10^n - \frac{1}{8} 10^{n - 1} = $$ $$= 10^n\bigg(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{10}\bigg(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{8}\bigg)\bigg) =$$ $$= \frac{747}{400}\cdot 10^n = 1.8675 \cdot 10^n$$ Which is a not correct formula. You may ask why is it wrong? I have bruteforced this problem for small $n$ up to $4$ . For $n = 3$ I should have had $1575$ and for $n = 4 - 15750$ . Which makes formula more like $1.575 \cdot 10^n$ . And I wonder what and where went wrong? P.S. I remembered my yesterday idea when I was trying to figure out $n = 2$ case: As before I need to count amount of all possible $k \in \{1, 2, 4, 5\}$ . $$10 \leq a\cdot k < 100$$ The ans is (by division I mean floored division): $\frac{99}{1} + \frac{99}{2} + \frac{99}{4} + \frac{99}{5} - (\frac{9}{1} + \frac{9}{1} + \frac{9}{1} + \frac{9}{1}) = 99 + 49 + 24 + 19 - 36 = 155$ , which IS a correct answer for $n = 2$ . I completely don't remember how I derived this equation, though now I think it was a complete fluke idea which led me to right answer. What's more interesting if I do the same for general formula equation it is indeed leading to the right answer too. $$10^n\bigg(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{10}\bigg(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1}\bigg)\bigg) =$$ $$= \frac{63}{40}\cdot 10^n = 1.575 \cdot 10^n$$ But still I want to know what went wrong with my initial solution since I don't know at all how to derive the correct formula.","['elementary-number-theory', 'solution-verification', 'combinatorics']"

Consider the sequence defined as follows: $c_1 = F_3 = 2$ and $c_n = \frac{F_{2n}}{F_{2n-1}} + 1$ $\forall n>1$ . First of all note that $c_i \geq 2 \forall i\in\mathbf{N}$ (in fact the sequence is monotone increasing and it converges to $1+\phi \approx 2.618$ ).

We begin by showing $f$ is injective: let $x_1, x_2 \in (-1,1)$ such that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ . Using elementary algebra, we find that $(x_1 - x_2)(1 + x_1x_2) = 0$ , which implies $x_1 = x_2$ or $1 + x_1x_2 = 0$ . If the former, then we are done. If the latter, then note that $x_1 \neq x_2$ , but if $x_1 = 0$ then $1 + 0x_2 = 1 \neq 0$ , which is a contradiction. Therefore, $x_1 = x_2$ , and so $f$ is injective. We will now show that $f$ is surjective. We believe the simplest way to do so is to show that $\exists g : \mathbb{R} \to (-1,1)$ such that $f \circ g = I_\mathbb{R}$ . That is, $$\frac{g(x)}{1 - (g(x))^2} = x,$$ and using elementary algebra we find that $$g(x) = \frac{-1 -\sqrt{4x^2 + 1}}{2x} \quad\text{for }x \neq 0.$$ We then define $g(0) = 0$ and we have that $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, f(g(x)) = x$ , which implies $f$ is surjective. Therefore, $f$ is bijective. Now we let $a_1, a_2 \in (-1,1)$ such that $a_1 <_{(-1,1)} a_2$ . Since $f$ is bijective, $f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)$ , so $f(a_1) < f(a_2)$ or $f(a_2) < f(a_1)$ . If the former, then we are done. If the latter, then note that $f$ is strictly increasing $(-1,1)$ , which is a therefore a contradiction, so we are done.

4510526,Are there affine planes with no abelian group of translations?,"I'm reading the classic book  ""Geometric algebra"" by Emil Artin and I have a question/reference request about a remark in it. In order to make this question self-contained, let me start by defining some notions. ""Affine plane"" is meant in the sense of incidence geometry. That is, a configuration of points and lines such that: 1) any two distinct points lie in a unique line, 2) given a line $l$ and a point $P$ not in $l$ there is a unique line parallel to $l$ through $P$ , and 3) there are three points which are not collinear. Similarly, by ""translation"" one means a mapping of the affine plane onto itself that either is the identity, or sends each line to a parallel line and has no fixed points (see definitions 2.3 and 2.5 of the book). We also define the ""direction"" of a translation $\tau$ as the set of all (parallel) lines $l$ with the property that if $P$ is in $l$ also $\tau(P)$ is in $l$ . It is then proven that for any affine plane the set of all translations form a group with composition, and that if there are two translations with different directions this group is abelian. Just after it, there is a remark (at the very end of section II.2, beginning of p.58 in my edition) where it is said: It is conceivable that the geometry contains only translations with a single direction $\pi$ (aside from the identity). It is an undecided question whether $T$ (the group of translations) has to be commutative in this case. Probably there do exist counter-examples, but none is known. Since this book is more than 50 years old, presumably today more is known about this question. My questions are: What are some examples of affine planes where all translations have the same direction? Is nowadays known if there is some affine plane with nonabelian group of translations (or if on the contrary, the translation group is always abelian)? I would appreciate any pointers to literature regarding these two questions. Thanks in advance.","['geometry', 'reference-request', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'combinatorics', 'affine-geometry']"
