405384,"$R_n = 3(2^n)-4(5^n)$, $n \geq0$, prove $R_n$ satisfies $R_n = 7R_{n-1}-10R_{n-2}$","So the question is: $R_n=3(2^n)-4(5^n)$ for $n\ge 0$; prove that $R_n$ satisfies $R_n=7R_{n-1}-10R_{n-2}$. I don't really know what to do from here. If I substitute $$R_n = 3(2^n)-4(5^n)$$ into $$Rn = 7R_{n-1}-10R_{n-2}$$ I end up getting $$R_n = 7\Big(3(2^{n-1})-4(5^{n-1})\Big)-10\Big(3(2^{n-2})-4(5^{n-2})\Big)$$ Dont know what to do... EDIT: Thanks to Zev, what I did was: $$3(2^n)-4(5^n)=7\bigg[3(2^{n-1})-4(5^{n-1})\bigg]-10\bigg[3(2^{n-2})-4(5^{n-2})\bigg].$$
$$\begin{align*}
3(2^n)-4(5^n)&=21(2^{n-1})-28(5^{n-1})-30(2^{n-2})+40(5^{n-2})\\\\
3(2^n)-4(5^n)&=21(2^{n})(2^{-1})-28(5^{n})(5^{-1})-30(2^{n})(2^{-2})+40(5^{n})(5^{-2})\\\\

405391,Expected gap between two consecutive order statistics,"Consider a random variable $X\sim_X(x)$ with $\operatorname{supp}{p_X}=[a,b]\subset{\mathbb R}$, and let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be $n$ $i.i.d.$ samples from $p_X(x)$, then we have their associated order statistics $X_{(1:n)}, X_{(2:n)}, \ldots, X_{(n:n)}$ such that $X_{(1:n)}\leqslant X_{(2:n)}\leqslant \cdots\leqslant  X_{(n:n)}$.
Define the spacing between any two consecutive order statistics as $W_{(r:n)}=X_{(r+1:n)}-X_{(r:n)} (1\leqslant r\leqslant n-1)$, then in ""Note on Francis Galton's problem"" by K. Pearson (1902), it has been shown that 
$$
{\mathbb E}\left[W_{(r:n)}\right]=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(x)^{n-r}[1-F(x)]^r \, dx, \hspace{2mm} 1\leqslant r\leqslant n-1,
$$
where $F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xp_X(y) \, dy$ is the distribution function of $X$. So, $\forall r, n$ such that $1\leqslant r\leqslant n-1$, $2\leqslant n$, do we have
$$
{\mathbb E}\left[W_{(r:n)}\right] \geqslant {\mathbb E}\left[W_{(r:n+1)}\right],
$$ 
i.e., the expected gap between any two consecutive order statistics will decrease or remain the same as $n$ increases? Intuitively, this is correct since the more samples one draws, the denser the order statistics will be filled in the support. I also checked several specific distributions (e.g., uniform, Gaussian, etc), and the statement holds, but I have not figured out a good way to prove this for the general case. Hope someone can provide some inspiration.","['statistics', 'order-statistics']"

405416,Question about Noncommutative Rings by I. N. Herstein,"Here's an example that I do not quite understand it fully, it's on page 6 of the book. And here's what it says: Let $F$ be a field, and $F_n$ be a ring of all $n\times n$ matrices over $F$ . We consider $F_n$ as the ring of all linear transformations on the vector space $V$ of $n-$ tuples of elements of $F$ . If $A$ is a subset of $F_n$ , let $\overline{A}$ be the sub-algebra generated by $A$ over $F$ . Clearly, $V$ is a faithful $F_n-$ module, and so, $\overline{A}$ -module . $V$ is in addition, both a unitary, and irreducible $F_n-$ module. We say the set of matrices $A \subset F_n$ is irreducible if $V$ is an irreducible $\overline{A}-$ module. In matrix terms, it merely says that there is no invertible matrix $S$ in $F_n$ so that $$S^{-1}aS = \left( \begin{array}{c|c} a_1 & 0 \\ \hline * & a_2  \end{array} \right)$$ for all $a \in A$ . The bolded parts are what I don't understand Firstly, why must $V$ be a faithfull $F_n-$ module in order to be an $\overline{A}-$ module? What will happen if $V$ is not faithful? Secondly, I don't understand the bolded part start with ""in matrix terms..."", say I have $V$ is an irreducible $\overline{A}-$ module. How can I deduce the last part? And I don't get the star in the expression $S^{-1}aS$ as well, what does it stand for, is it a wild-card? I think this has to do with some matrix knowledge that I'm missing, so if the explanation is pretty long, please just give me a reference on what I should read.

405446,Is the variant direct image mathematically significant?,"Preimages have the property that for an arbitrary function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ and all $B \subseteq Y$ it holds that $$f^{-1}(B^c)=[f^{-1}(B)]^c.$$ However, the analogous statement for direct images is false. Thus, we have two definitions of direct image; the usual one, and a variant. $$f_*(A) = \{b \mid \exists a \in X : a \in A \,\wedge\, f(a)=b\}$$
$$f_\diamond(A) = \{b \mid \forall a \in X : a \in A \,\vee\, f(a) \neq b\}$$ Now I think (though I have not proved it) that, for all functions $f$, it holds that $f_* = f_\diamond$ iff $f$ is an injection bijection. Note also that, under these definitions, we have $$f_*(A^c) = [f_\diamond(A)]^c, \quad f_\diamond(A^c)=[f_*(A)]^c.$$ Here's another observation. If $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, then we have that $f_*$ preserves openness iff $f_\diamond$ preserves closedness, and vice versa. Okay, but does $f_\diamond$ have any real mathematical significance? Like, does it show up naturally in any interesting theorems etc.? If so, what's the standard terminology/notation, and where can I learn more? Addendum . Two related maps are $f_\cap(A) := f_*(A) \cap f_\diamond(A)$ and $f_\cup(A) := f_*(A) \cup f_\diamond(A).$ If anyone knows where I can learn more, please leave a comment!

405451,Is it possible to find out $x^2$ parabola and function from 3 given points?,"I am programming a ball falling down from a cliff and bouncing back. The physics can be ignored and I want to use a simple $y = ax^2$ parabola to draw the falling ball. I have given two points, the edge of the cliff at $C(-0.9; 0.8)$ and the point where the ball hits the bottom $B(0.1; -1.05)$. Due to its symmetry we know there is another point at $A(-1.9; -1.05)$. So that are 3 points I could work with. $C$ is the vertex. I've tried this approach but my parabola is not as exact as I need it to estimate for example the intersects with the x- or y-axis. As the legs of the parabola are down, all I can tell is that $a$ is negative: $$
 y = ax^2 + bx +c; a < 0

405485,Implied prior with relationship $y=\text{arccot}(x)$,"I'm trying to solve an exercise, which I think I have almost managed to solve but not quite. Any help would be appreciated! So, what we have is a vector which we obtain by norming the vector $\lambda=(x, 1)$, where $x \in (-\infty, \infty)$, into ""half unit circle"". I assume that this means that the vector we get is: $$\lambda^*=\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\right)$$ Expressed in terms of the polar coordinates, the vector is $$
\lambda^*=(\cos y, \sin y)
$$
where $y\in[0,\pi)$. If $y$ is assigned the uniform prior, what is the implied prior for $x$? A hint is that $y=\text{arccot}x$. My way of reasoning is this. First, the cdf of $y$ is
$$
F_Y(y)=\frac{y}{\pi}, \quad 0\leq y <\pi.
$$ Furthermore, we have the following relationship:
$$
\sin y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}
$$
which means $$
\sqrt{x^2+1}=\frac{1}{\sin y}\\
x=\left(\frac{1}{\sin y}\right)^2-1
$$ Using the transformation theorem, we can obtain $$
F_X(x)=Pr(X\leq x)=Pr\left(\frac{1}{(\sin Y)^2}-1\leq x\right)=Pr\left(\frac{1}{x+1}\leq(\sin Y)^2\right)
$$
This is where I think I go wrong. To continue and get $Y$ by itself, I need to take the square root and then the inverse of sin. But then I'll have $\sqrt{x+1}$, which will yield non-real numbers for $x<-1$ (remember that $x\in(-\infty, \infty)$.

405497,I would like to know an intuitive way to understand a Cauchy sequence and the Cauchy criterion.,"My understanding from the definition in my book (Rudin) is this. A seq. $\{p_n\}$ in a metric space $X$ (I only really know $\mathbb R^k$) is said to be a Cauchy sequence if for any given $\epsilon > 0$, $\exists N\in \mathbb N$ such that $\forall n,m\ge N$, $d(p_n,p_m)<\epsilon$. (1) I see it as, given any tiny value $\epsilon$, we can find a natural number $N$ large enough so that the distance between $p_n$ and $p_m$ is less than $\epsilon$. Am I right ? The reason I'm asking this is because I was trying to understand the proof of how
$$\sum a_nb_n$$
can converge, and the book said this $$\left\lvert \sum_{n=p}^{q}a_nb_n\right\rvert \leq \epsilon$$ satisfies the Cauchy criterion and therefore it converges. I read other questions and answers about the Cauchy sequence, but it didn't really help me… Can someone explain me what's going on? Edit: Suppose a) the partial sums of $A_n = \Sigma a_n$ form a bounded sequence b) $b_0 \geq b_1 \geq \dotsb$ c) $\lim_{b \to \infty} b_n = 0$ Using the partial summation formula, algebraically the equation in the bottom is proved $$\left\lvert \sum_{n=p}^{q}a_nb_n \right\rvert \leq \epsilon$$ Algebraically I had no problem, but I don't know why this proves convergence.

$$ I'm unsure how to compute $\limsup_{y\to y_0}f(x,y)$ since I've only dealt with limit superiors of sequences, and limits of single variable functions. My guess is $\limsup_{y\to y_0}f(x,y)=f(x,y_0)$. After that, since $f$ is continuous at $(x_0,y_0)$, it is continuous at each coordinate, so $f(x,y_0)$ should be continuous at $x_0$, so $\lim_{x\to x_0}f(x,y_0)=f(x_0,y_0)$.

405532,Proof of the Riesz Representation Theorem,"Theorem : Let $F$ be a continuous linear functional on the Hilbert space $H$, then $\exists !$ (exists one and only one) $y \in H$ such that $F(x) = (x,y)$ for $x\in H$. Proof : Uniqueness: $$F(x)=(x,y)=(x,y') \Rightarrow (x,y-y')=0 \space \forall x \in H \Rightarrow ||y-y'||^2=0$$ Existence: if for any $x\in H, \space F(x) =(x,y)= 0 $ we'll set $y=0$. Let that $F \neq 0. $ and define a closed subspace $H_0 = \{x \in H: F(x)=0\}$. We know that $H \neq H_0$ because $H_0 = F^{-1}(\{0\})$. Q1 : ""$H_0$ is a subspace by the linearity of $F$, closed by continuity of $F$."" What does this mean? I understand what's a subspace, but don't understand what does it have to do with linearity and continuity. $\exists z\in H$ such that $||z||=1$. For $u \in H_0, \space F(u)=(u,z) =0$. Q2 : Does this imply that $u \perp z \space \forall u \in H_0, \forall z \in H$? Let's define $u=F(x)z - F(z)x, \space x \in H$ $$F(u)=(F(x)z - F(z)x,z)=F(x)F(z)-F(z)F(x)=0=F(x)(z,z)-F(z)(x,z)$$ 
Since we know that $||z|| = \sqrt{(z,z)}=1$, then 
$$0=F(x)(z,z)-F(z)(x,z) \Rightarrow F(x) =F(z)(x,z) = (x,\bar{F(z)z)} $$ 
By defining $y= \bar{F(z)}z$ we've completed the proof. By the way, the bar on the top denotes the complex conjugate, as is common in Hilbert spaces. i.e. $\alpha (x,y)= (\alpha x,y)=(x,\bar{\alpha} y) $ Corollary : If $H=L^2(\mu)$ and $F$ is a continuous linear functional on $L^2(\mu)$, then $\exists ! \space g \in L^2(\mu)$ such that $$F(f)=\int_X f \bar{g} d\mu = (f,g)$$ In the context of the Radon-Nikodym theorem, $g$ is the R-N derivative.","['banach-spaces', 'measure-theory', 'riesz-representation-theorem', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

405650,Proof of the Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym Theorem,"Theorem : Let $\lambda, \mu$ be $\sigma$-finite measures defined on the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ of the space $X$. Then, a) Lebesgue decomposition: $\lambda=\lambda_a+\lambda_s$ where $\lambda_a \ll \mu$ and $\lambda_s \perp \mu$ b) $\exists h \in L^1(\mu)$ such that $\lambda_a = \int h d\mu$ Proof : Define $\phi=\lambda + \mu \space \phi(X)<\infty, \space f \in L^2(\phi) $. Then $f \to \int f d\lambda $ is a continuous linear functional on $L^2(\phi)$ Because:
$$\int_X |f| d\lambda \le \int |f| d\phi \le \Bigg( \int_X |f|^2 d\phi \Bigg)^{\frac12}\Bigg( \int_X d\phi \Bigg)^{\frac12} $$ Q1 : How does this prove the aforementioned claim? Don't we already have $f \to \int f d\lambda $ is a continuous linear functional on $L^2(\phi)$  from the fact that $f \in L^2(\phi) $? Moving on, from the Riesz Representation theorem we know, that $\exists ! \space g \in L^2(\phi) $ such that $$\int_X f d\lambda = \int_X fg d\phi $$. Choosing $f=\chi_E, \space E \in \mathcal{A}, \space \phi(E)<\infty$ we obtain $\lambda(E)=\int_E g d\phi$ and I'm told, that $$\lambda(E)=\int_E g d\phi \Rightarrow 0 \le \frac{1}{\phi(E)}\int_E g d\phi = \frac{\lambda(E)}{\phi(E)} \le 1$$ Q2 Why does the above implication hold? From the above equality we know, that $g(x) \in [0,1]$, an absolutely crucial fact for the rest of the proof. We define $A=\{x:g(x)<1\} \text{ and } B=\{x: g(x)=1\}$. Now,
$$\lambda(E) = \lambda(E\cap A) + \lambda(E \cap B) = \lambda_a (E)+\lambda_s(E)$$ $$\int_X f d\lambda = \int_X fg d (\lambda+\mu) \Rightarrow \int_X f(1-g) d \lambda = \int_X fg d \mu $$. Choosing $f=\chi_B$ we obtain $\mu(B)=0 \Rightarrow \mu \perp \lambda_s$ Choosing $f=\chi_E \sum_{k=0}^n g^k$ we obtain $$\int_E (1-g^{n+1}) d \lambda = \int_E \sum_{k=1}^n g^k d \mu \\ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E (1-g^{n+1}) d \lambda = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E \sum_{k=1}^n g^k d \mu$$. and since  $(1-g^{n+1}) \nearrow 1$ and $\sum_{k=1}^n g^k \nearrow h$ we can use the monotone convergence theorem to get $$\lambda(E\cap A)=\lambda_a(E) = \int_E h d \mu $$ Remark: for $x \in B$ we get 0 measure because $g(x)=1$.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

What are necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the semidirect products $G \rtimes H_1$ and $G\rtimes H_2$ to be isomorphic?

My solution for $(a)$ was: suppose $T$ is inner product preserving, then since $|x|=\sqrt{\left\langle x,x \right\rangle}$ we have that $|T(x)| = \sqrt{\left\langle T(x),T(x)\right\rangle}=\sqrt{\left\langle x, x\right\rangle} = |x|$ so that $T$ is norm preserving. Suppose now that $T$ is norm preserving, so we have the polarization identity: $$\left\langle T(x), T(y)\right\rangle=\frac{|T(x)+T(y)|^2 - |T(x)-T(y)|^2}{4}$$ But by virtue of linearity $T(x)+T(y) = T(x+y)$ and $T(x)-T(y)=T(x-y)$ and so since $T$ preserves norms we have $\left\langle T(x),T(y)\right\rangle = \left\langle x,y\right\rangle$ so that $T$ is inner product preserving also. My solution for $(b)$ was: Suppose that $T(x) = 0$, then we have $|T(x)| = 0$, but since $T$ is norm preserving $|x| = 0$ and this implies $x = 0$ so that $T$ is injective. Also by the rank-nullity theorem $T$ is surjective because $\dim \ker T = 0$ and so $\dim \operatorname{Im} T = \dim \Bbb R^n$. Now, because of that, given $y \in \Bbb R^n$ there's some $x \in \Bbb R^n$ such that $ y = T(x)$. In that case, consider the norm of $T^{-1}(y)$, because of the analysis that there's some $x$ such that $y= T(x)$ we will have: $$T^{-1}(y) = x$$ Now recalling that $T$ preserves norms, we have that $|x| = |T(x)|$, but $T(x) = y$ so that $|x| = |y|$, so taking the norm on the above equation we finally have: $$\left|T^{-1}(y)\right| = |x| = |T(x)| = |y|$$ Are my solutions correct?

In this case however, we don't care if others get a match, only that I do (muahahaha!), so I am guessing this is, instead of being in line with $_{n}C_{k}$ this is $_{n}C_{1}$ Where I am the $1$! This is a bit more advanced in that we are looking at the ""percentage of compatibility"".  So I am going start by taking the 29 degrees of freedom and looking at things in a binary way i.e. either a match is compatible on a degree of freedom (same answer to a question) or they are not. Now by my calculations there are 29 questions, so as with light switches, there are $2^{29} = 536870912$ ways to answer the questions.  So if half the eH members are women, then there is a 20,000,000/536,870,912 = 3.7% chance that I would answer exactly as a potential match. It seems there should or could be much more to it in that say I went about the computation from the point of view that the probability of not answering the questions the same.  So I think I would have something such as $$(1-2^{28}/2^{29})(1-2^{27}/2^{29})(1-2^{26}/2^{29})\space...\space(1-2^{0}/2^{29})$$ which seems to reduce to: $$((2^{28})(3 \cdot 2^{27})(7 \cdot 2^{26}) \space ... \space(2^{2}(2^{27}-1))(2^{1}(2^{28}-1)) \cdot (2^{29}-1))/(2^{29})^{29}$$  after multiplying the numerator by  $(2^{29})^{29}$. I am not sure what this reduces too - hopefully more matches than I am currently getting.. I wonder though if I am on the right track?  I however wonder about the 20,000,000.  If I were to take the possible ""state spaces"" or the $2^{29}$ possible choices for the 29 degrees of freedom (treated as binary yes/no), as it were the possible 365 days in a year birthday state space, then I come up with: $$\frac{2^{29}!}{(2^{29})^{20,000,000}\cdot (2^{29} - 20,000,000)!}$$ which just seems insane.

406046,A question on gauge norm on Orlicz space,"I was reading Empirical Processes from ""Weak Convergence and Empirical processes"" by Van Der Waart and Jon Wellner. There I was studying a norm on a space of random variables defined as follows: Let $\psi$ be a monotone nondecreasing, convex function with $\psi(0) = 0$ (*). The gauge (Luxemburg) norm of an integrable random variable X wrt $\psi$ is given by $$\|X\|_{\psi} = \inf \left\{u>0: \mathbb{E}\left[\psi\left(\frac{|X|}{u}\right) \right] \leq 1\right\}$$ As an exercise, the book asks to prove that if $1\leq p\leq q$, then
$$\|X\|_{\psi_p} \leq \left(\log 2\right)^{p/q} \|X\|_{\psi_q}$$ where $\psi_p = e^{x^p}-1$ and all logs are natural logs. My question is how to go about it. I have succeeded in proving the following results which may turn out to be useful here: a) If $\psi$ and $\phi$ are two functions satisfying the requirement (*), and $\psi \leq \phi$, then $\|X\|_{\psi} \leq \|X\|_{\phi}$. b) Given a constant $C \geq 1$, $\|X\|_{C\psi} \leq C\|X\|_{\psi} $ c) For $p \geq 1$, $(\log2)^{1/p}\|X\|_{\psi_p}$ is monotone nondecreasing in p. Note: $\psi_p$ as defined above. d) For $\psi = x^p$, it is the standard $L_p$ norm of X. I figured it would follow from (c) since the book hints at that but wasn't having much luck with it. I even tried splitting the domain of $e^{x^p}$ into two parts, $x\geq 1$ and $0 \leq x < 1$ and tried manipulating but that got me nowhere. I appreciate any hints, ideas and even answers on this one. Please note: One can associate several equivalent norms to an Orlicz space.

406094,Microsoft Paint Spraypaint Tool,"The following question is motivated by the spraypaint tool in Microsoft Paint.

Determine $E(n,k)$, the expected number of rolls needed so that all numbers $1,\ldots,k$ have appeared on some roll. The translation to spraypaint can be seen by assuming the range of the spraypaint tool is $k$ pixels, and each click paints $n$ random pixels.

But the proofs I've seen, while short and simple enough, have never made its proof seem quite so clear. Is there some major complication I'm missing here? I don't see anything fishy in assuming the existence of the generators, or proving the form of $g$, or actually constructing the isomorphism. But I assume I'm missing something because I've never seen the result proved like this, even though it's an obvious construction. Is the longer proof for pedagogical reasons (i.e. the lemmas and techniques are useful later), or am I missing a big hole in this proof?","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abelian-groups']"
406291,Intuition of law of iterated logarithm,"Let $X_i$ be iid random variables with $EX_i = 0$ and $Var X_i=1$ and $S_n=X_1+\cdots+X_n$. Then the law of the iterated logarithm says almost everywhere we have $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}} = \sqrt{2}$$ On the other hand the central limit theorem says $$\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n}} \to N(0,1)$$ Can anyone explain why dividing by an extra $\sqrt{\log{\log{n}}}$ should go from giving $N(0,1)$ to something bounded by the constant $\sqrt{2}$? To try to understand I considered the simple case when each $X_n$ is $N(0,1)$ so that $S_n/\sqrt{n}$ is also normally distributed as $N(0,1)$. Then $S_n/\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}$ is distributed as $N(0,1/\log{\log{n}})$. Then it would seem to me that to even have just $\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}} \le \sqrt{2}$ requires either $$\sum_{n=3}^\infty P\left(\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}} > \sqrt{2}\right) < \infty$$ or if $$\sum_{n=3}^\infty P\left(\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}} > \sqrt{2}\right) = \infty$$ then to achieve $\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}} \le \sqrt{2}$ the sets {$ \omega : \frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}} > \sqrt{2}$} cannot for example cover the probability space over and over infinitely forever. I don't know the value of $\sum_{n=3}^\infty P\left(\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}} > \sqrt{2}\right)$ but since it is the sum of the probability of the tail ends of a bunch of normal distributions you would expect there to be no closed form even for partial sums. In the other direction for $\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}}$ to not have a value lower than $\sqrt{2}$ isn't it necessary that something like the following holds $$\sum_{n=3}^\infty P\left(\sqrt{2}-\epsilon < \frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n\log{\log{n}}}} \le \sqrt{2}\right) = \infty$$ Can anyone explain why this number $\sqrt{2}$ should pop up?","['probability-theory', 'intuition', 'probability']"
406332,"Showing that $f(x)=x\sin (1/x)$ is not absolutely continuous on $[0,1]$","On the interval [0,1].  Define $f(x)=x\sin(1/x)$ for $x\in(0,1]$ and $f(0)=0$.  I didn't work out the exact details but I'm pretty sure that then $$\Big |\int_0^xf'(t)dt\Big |=\infty,$$ due to a process similar to something of the form $1-2+3-4+5-...$ , as one approaches zero from above. However according to the measure-theoretic definition of absolute continuity, there should in fact be some set of measure zero $E\in[0,1]$ such that $$\Big |\int_Ef'd\mu\Big | > 0.$$ I wasn't under the impression that this was even possible. Edit: Maybe I wasn't clear about what my question is.  What I want is a proof (constructive or not) that there exists a set of measure zero $E$ such that $\Big |\int_Ef'd\mu\Big | > 0.$  Or if that's not possible then for someone to explain to me what my misconception is concerning the measure theoretic definition of absolute continuity: For $v(E)=\int_Efd\mu$.

406341,Why is the empty set finite?,"On page 25 of Principles of Mathematical Analysis (ed. 3) by Rudin, there is the definition (excluding the irrelevant parts for this question): Definition 2.4: For any positive integer $n$ , let $J_n$ be the set whose elements are the integers $1,2,...,n$ ; let $J$ be the set consisting of all positive integers. For any set $A$ , we say: (a) $A$ is finite if $A \thicksim J_n$ for some $n$ (the empty set is also considered to be finite). I am unsure why the empty set is considered to be finite. Given the defintion, for the empty set to be finite, then $\emptyset \thicksim J_n$ for some $n$ . The issue is for equivalence, there has to exist a one-to-one mapping of $\emptyset$ onto $J_n$ . $\emptyset$ has no elements to correspond and since the definition requires $n \in J$ , $J_n$ will always have at least one element. Thus, my question: Why is the empty set considered finite?","['general-topology', 'equivalence-relations', 'relations']"

406369,Skorokhod Embedding theorem proof,"It occurs in Durrett's proof of Skorokhod embedding that he needs the following. Suppose that we have a Brownian motion $B_t$ in $1$-d that starts at $0$. (To be clear, it is not necessarily constructed on the Wiener space, but I do require it to be everywhere continuous.  With that assumption, then we have that $T_{b, a}=\inf\{t\geq 0 : B_t \notin (a, b)\}$ is a stopping time wrt the standard right continuous (RC) filtration.)  If $U, V$ are RVs with $U\geq0$ and $V\leq0$ then supposedly the function $T_{U, V}$ is measurable. (with respect to the original sigma algebra for which $U, V$ are RVs.)  Notice that this does not make it a stopping time. I need help with that. He also then uses the optional stopping theorem for continuous RC martingales with RC filtrations.  This theorem implies that if $T$ is the stopping time and $X_t$ is the martingale, then $X_T$ is measurable wrt the sigma algebra of the stopping time $T$ and also for all $t\geq0$ we have $X_T=E(X_t\mid \mathfrak{F}_T)$ on $\{T<t\}$ a.s. Durrett only says that by conditioning on the values of $(U, V)$, we can apply this to our situation above to conclude that (By now he has already started assuming the measurability of $T_{U, V}$.) $$E(T_{U, V})=E\lbrace E(T_{U, V}\mid (U, V))\rbrace=E(-UV).$$ He has already shown that $E(T_{b,a})=-ab$.  Where I object is it seems like his manipulation is ""treating $U, V$ as constant"" just because they are the subject of being ""conditioned upon.""  I don't understand this, especially since $U, V$ are allowed to take values in continua.

One can search the site to see this code has been used in some Computational group theory problems, for example here . A.H.Clifford gives a prime constructive theorem in his book, The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups as follows: Theorem 1.9. Let $a$ be an element of a semigroup $S$, and let $\langle a\rangle$ be the cyclic subsemigroup of $S$ generated by $a$. If $\langle a\rangle$ is infinite, all the powers of $a$ are distict. If $\langle a\rangle$ is finite, there exist two positive integers, the index $r$ and the period $m$ of $a$, such that $a^{m+r}=a^r$ and the order of $\langle a\rangle$ being $m+r-1$. The set $$K_a=\{a^r,a^{r+1},...,a^{m+r-1}\}$$ is a cyclic subgroup of $S$ of order $m$. My question: We see that for any semigroup $S$ and $a\in S$ of finite order, we have an structure like $K_a$ which is a group . How can be investigated which finite group(s) has(have) the same structure(s) with a given $K_a$. It seems that cause of existing words in $K_a$ it is so difficult maybe impossible to use above code.
