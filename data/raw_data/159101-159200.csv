2735762,Hypotheses testing without a standard deviation,"So, there seems to be a gap in my knowledge somewhere... here's the question A species of a common butterfly with a large population occurs in two different types, light (type
$L$) and dark (type $D$). A naturalist observes 10 of the butterflies in a particular wood, $2$ of which
are type $L$ and $8$ are type $D$. The naturalist wishes to decide whether this sample provides
significant evidence that the proportion of type L butterflies differs from the proportion of type $D$
butterflies in this wood. Is there evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the $5\%$ level? So I believe this requires the T distribution due to the small sample size.
So using $\frac{X-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{10}}}$. I take $X$ as $=5$ as it's half the size as the proportion of both $L$ and $D$ should be $=$. Then $\mu=2$ as that was the actual value and $n$ as $10$. But what would $\sigma$ be? Or am I approaching this wrong? is there a way to find the standard deviation from this?","['statistics', 'probability', 'hypothesis-testing', 'probability-distributions']"

2736013,Heisenberg's inequality,"The Heisenberg's inequality in $\Bbb{R}$ reads $$\|f\|_{L^2}^4\leq \int_{\Bbb{R}}x^2f(x)^2dx\int_{\Bbb{R}}\xi^2\hat{f}(\xi)^2d\xi$$ where by $\hat{f}$ we refer to the Fourier transform of $f$. The aformentioned inequality refered to as Heisenberg's since it is in consistency with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which states that $$\sigma_x\sigma_\xi\geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$ where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $h/(2\pi)$). A simple interpretation of that is: $f$ and $\hat{f}$ can't both be concentrated in a small region . Now, consider the following which holds in periodic domain $\Bbb{T}$
$$\|f\|_{L^2(\Bbb{T})}^2=\sum_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}|c_k(f)|^2\leq \sup_{k\in \Bbb{Z}}|c_k(f)|\sum_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}|c_k(f)|\leq \underbrace{\|f\|_{L^1(\Bbb{T})}}_{space}\times \underbrace{\sum_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}|c_k(f)|}_{frequency}$$
does the aformentioned has anything to do with Heisenberg inequality and its interpretation since it involves as i indicated above the $L^2$ norm of $f$ controlled by a measurement in space multiplied by its counterpart in frequency space?","['mathematical-physics', 'real-analysis', 'inequality', 'fourier-analysis']"

2736126,"$\lim_m \mathbb{P}\left\{ \left|S_n\right| > b \sqrt{n} \text{ for some }n\le m\right\} = 1\,?$","Let $b$ be some positive number (say $b = 1.96$). Let $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ be a sequence of iid random variables such that they are mean zero and variance $1$. Let $S_n = X_1 + \cdots + X_n$. How can I show that $$\lim_m \mathbb{P}\left\{ \left|S_n\right| > b \sqrt{n} \text{ for some }n\le m\right\} = 1\,?$$ The hint says law of iterated logarithm, which states that
$$\mathbb{P}\left\{ \limsup_{n\to\infty} \frac{S_n}{\sqrt{2n \log\log n}} =1\right\}=1.$$ I have some hand-wavy thoughts (in fact I guess I'm close), but not sure how to write a concrete proof. LIL suggests that for almost all $\omega\in\Omega$ and any $\epsilon>0$,
$$\left|\sup_{n\ge m} \frac{S_n}{\sqrt{2n\log \log n}}-1\right| < \epsilon$$
for large $m$. This implies
$$1-\epsilon< \sup_{n\ge m}\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{2n \log \log n}}<1+\epsilon$$ Which implies
$$\frac{S_n}{\sqrt{2n \log \log n}}< 1+\epsilon \,\,\forall n\ge m \text{, and }1-\epsilon < \frac{S_k}{\sqrt{2k \log \log k}} \text{ for some }k\ge m$$ The second one implies
$$\frac{\left|S_k\right|}{\sqrt{k}}>\left(1-\epsilon\right)\sqrt{2 \log \log k}>\left(1-\epsilon\right) \sqrt{2 \log \log m}$$ But how should I proceed? First, $m$ depends on $\epsilon$, so I'm not sure if I can make $\left(1-\epsilon\right)\sqrt{2 \log \log m} \ge b$. But second, even if I can, this would only show that
$$\mathbb{P}\left\{\text{Given }b,\text{ there exists }k \text{ s.t. }\left|S_k\right| > b\sqrt{k} \right\} = 1$$ Update : So after some thoughts I think I came up with the following proof. Still, any alternative/simpler proof is welcomes! Almost surely, we have
$$\forall \epsilon>0, \exists M_\epsilon \text{ s.t. } \left| \sup_{n\ge m} \frac{S_n}{\sqrt{2n\log \log n}} - 1 \right|< \epsilon \text{ for all } m \ge M_\epsilon$$ In particular, almost surely, we have
$$\left|\sup_{n\ge m} \frac{S_n}{\sqrt{2 n \log \log n}} - 1 \right| < \frac{1}{2} \text{ for all }m\ge M_{1/2}$$ Given $b > 0$, there exists $N$ such that $\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2 \log \log N}= b$. Then, almost surely, we have $$\left|\sup_{n\ge m} \frac{S_n}{\sqrt{2 n \log \log n}} - 1 \right| < \frac{1}{2} \text{ for all }m\ge \max\left(M_{1/2},N\right)$$ This implies that almost surely we have
$$\frac{S_k}{\sqrt{2k \log \log k}} >\frac{1}{2}\text{ for some }k\ge \max\left(M_{1/2},N\right)$$ In particular, this implies
$$\mathbb{P}\left\{ \frac{\left|S_k\right|}{\sqrt{k}} >  b \text{ for some }k\ge \max\left(M_{1/2}, N\right)\right\} = 1$$","['probability-theory', 'probability']"
2736208,How to find the Jordan canonical form of tensor products.,"Let $k$ be a field, $ A \in M_{m\times m}(k)$ be a single Jordan block with eigenvalue $a$, and $B \in M_{n\times n}(k)$ be a single Jordan block with eigenvalue $b$. $A$ and $B$ together define a linear transformation
$$A\otimes B : k^{m\times n} \to k^{m\times n} $$
and my question is what is the Jordan canonical form of $A\otimes B$? (The Jordan canonical form of $A\otimes B$ exists because the characteristic polynomial of $A\otimes B$ splits and equals $(t-ab)^{mn}$) One can tickle this question directly by finding the $A\otimes B$ invariant subspaces of $k^{m\times n}$: Assume $m\geq n$, let $\{e_i\}$ be a basis of $k^m$, and $\{f_j\}$ be a basis of $k^n$, then $\{e_i\otimes f_j\}$ form a basis of $k^{m\times n}$. In the case $a=b=0$, $k^{m\times n}$ decomposes into the direct sum
$$\bigoplus_{l=n-m}^{m-n} V_l$$
where $V_l=\mathrm{span}\{e_i\otimes e_j|i-j=l\}$, and $A\otimes B$ restricted to each $V_l$ is a single Jordan block.
The case exactly one of $a,b$ equals zero is not much harder. But the case $ab\neq 0$ is much more difficult. Another way to do find the elementary divisors of the map 
$$k[t]^{m\times n}\xrightarrow{tI-A\otimes B} k[t]^{m\times n}$$

2736214,Finding the Beltrami-Klein Geodesics,"I've been experimenting with the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic geometry.
According to Wikipedia, in this model the geodesics are given by Euclidean line segments, and I want to prove this.
Let $x^{\alpha}$ denote a geodesic with parameter $t$, then the geodesic is given by parallel transporting the tangent along itself, i.e.; $$\frac{d^2x^{\alpha}}{dt^2}+\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\ \beta \gamma}\frac{dx^{\beta}}{dt}\frac{dx^{\gamma}}{dt}=0$$ Where $\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\ \beta \gamma}$ are the Christoffel symbols. For this model we have that:
\begin{align*}
&\Gamma^{1}_{\ 11}=\frac{2x}{1-x^2-y^2}\\
&\Gamma^{1}_{\ 12}=\frac{y}{1-x^2-y^2}\\
&\Gamma^{2}_{\ 12}=\frac{x}{1-x^2-y^2}\\
&\Gamma^{2}_{\ 22}=\frac{2y}{1-x^2-y^2}\\
\end{align*} With $\Gamma^{\alpha}_{\ \beta \gamma}$ symmetric on the lower indices and all other symbols zero.
This yields 2 second order ODES for the components of the geodesic: $$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\frac{2}{1-x^2-y^2}\left(x\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+y\frac{dx}{dt}\frac{dy}{dt}\right)=0$$ $$\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}+\frac{2}{1-x^2-y^2}\left(y\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2+x\frac{dy}{dt}\frac{dx}{dt}\right)=0$$ I have no idea how to solve these equations and any help yould be much appreciated. I tried a simple case however:
Consider the geodesic joining $(x,y)=(0,0)$ to $(x,y)=(\frac{1}{2},0)$. If this is a Euclidean line as stated on wikipedia, it should be given by $x=t$, $y=0$, for $0\leq t\leq \frac{1}{2}$. Plugging this into the system of ODES yields: $$\frac{2t}{1-t^2}=0$$ $$0=0$$ So clearly this is not a solution! I thought that if Euclidean line segments were geodesics then they would satisfy the geodesic equation. I would really appreciate any help in solving the general ODES for the geodesic joining two points, as well as in understanding why the Euclidean line given above doesn't appear to be a geodesic.","['hyperbolic-geometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry', 'geodesic']"

2736231,Weird Invariant of Finite Reflection Groups,"I am looking for a proof of the following: Let $V$ be a real vector space of dimension $n$ over $\mathbb R$ endowed with an inner product $\langle \,, \rangle$ . Fix a basis $e_1, \cdots, e_n$ for $V$ and the dual basis $x_1, \cdots, x_n$ for $V^*$ . Let $G$ be a finite reflection group acting on $V$ , and thus acting on the ring $\mathbb R[x_1,\cdots, x_n]$ as $g\cdot P(v)= P(g^{-1} \cdot v)$ . By definition $\langle \,, \rangle$ is $G$ invariant. Let $P(v),Q(v) \in R[x_1,\cdots, x_n]$ homogeneous and $G$ -invariant polynomials, i.e. $g \cdot P(v) = P(v)$ for every $g \in G$ , for every $v \in V$ . Then $$\sum_{i,j=1}^n \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x_j}\langle e_i,e_j\rangle$$ is $G$ -invariant. Example: Let's consider the root system $\Phi=B_2$ and its associated group $G$ ; pick an hortonormal basis for $V=\mathbb R^2$ . A basis for the ring of invariants $\mathbb R[x,y]^G$ is given by $$P(x,y)=x^2 + y^2$$ $$Q(x,y)=x^2y^2.$$ Then we compute $$\sum_{i,j=1}^n \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x_j}\langle e_i,e_j\rangle = 2x(2x) + 2y(2y) = 2(x^2 + y^2) = 2P(x,y).$$ $$\sum_{i,j=1}^n \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x_j}\langle e_i,e_j\rangle = 2x(2xy^2) + 2y(2x^2y) = 8x^2y^2 = 8Q(x,y)$$ $$\sum_{i,j=1}^n \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x_j}\langle e_i,e_j\rangle = (2xy^2)^2 + (2x^2y)^2 = 4x^2y^2(x^2+y^2) = 4Q(x,y)P(x,y).$$ These are all polynomials in $P$ and $Q$ , and thus invariants. Thoughts: when the basis is orthonormal, this is just the inner product between gradients, so a geometric interpretation of this can tell us that in any fixed point $v$ the angle between the two gradients is not going to change, so it is invariant. I don't know how to produce an algebraic proof in the general setting.","['polynomials', 'finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'linear-algebra']"

2736299,Sequence arrangement and operation (combinatorics),"Consider a sequence $\langle x_1,x_2,x_3, \cdots, x_n\rangle $ such that $x_i> 0~ \forall 1\leq i\leq n$ and $x_i\geq x_j$ if $i\geq j$. An operation on the sequence will make it $\langle n, x_1-1, \cdots , x_n-1\rangle $ (not arranged) such that they are arranged in non-increasing order and if any element results into $0$ it will be removed. For the $n^\text{th}$ sequence, the $n+1^\text{th}$ sequence will have one element which is the count of the number of elements in the $n^\text{th}$ sequence followed by the reduction of each term by $1$. If any of the terms result into a $0$, we will remove it.
For example, $\langle 4211\rangle  \to \langle 431\rangle  \to \langle 332\rangle  \to \langle 3221\rangle  \to \langle 4211\rangle \to \langle 431\rangle  \to \cdots$.

But it's apparent and can be proven easily that a sequence of the form $\langle x,x-1, \cdots, 1\rangle $ is the only possible cycle. But I cant find all possible sequences that will result into this. Will every sequence enter a cycle at some point of time? If so, why and when? If not, for which cases?

2736594,Bijection for $q$-binomial coefficient,"Define the $q$-binomial (Gaussian) coefficient ${n+m\brack n}_q$ as the generating function for integer partitions (whose Ferrers diagrams are) fitting into a rectangle $n\times m$, i.e., for the set $P_{n,m}$ of partitions with at most $n$ parts, all at most $m$. From this definition, the $q$-analogs of Pascal's triangle identities, such as ${n+m\brack n}_q={n+m-1\brack n-1}_q+q^n{n+m-1\brack n}_q$, have straightforward combinatorial proofs which are also reminiscent of the ones for classical binomial coefficients (consider on one side the partitions which fit into the smaller rectangle $(n-1)\times m$, and on the other side those which do not, ergo fit in the rectangle $n\times(m-1)$ once one has removed their first column, with size $n$). Now, the exact formula $${n+m\brack n}_q=\frac{(q)_{n+m}}{(q)_n\,(q)_m},$$ where $(q)_n:=(1-q)(1-q^2)\cdots(1-q^n)$, may then be proved by induction.
However, one may rewrite this formula as $${n+m\brack n}_q\times\frac1{(q)_{n+m}}=\frac1{(q)_n}\times\frac1{(q)_m}.$$ Recalling that $\frac1{(q)_n}$ is the generating function for the set $P_n$ of partitions into at most $n$ parts (likewise, by conjugation, for the set $P'_n$ of partitions into parts at most $n$), this suggests that the sets $P_{n,m}\times P_{n+m}$ and $P_n\times P'_m$ are in bijection, where obviously $P_{n,m}=P_n\cap P'_m$. My question is whether a simple bijection exists. Say, given a pair $(\lambda,\mu)\in P_n\times P'_m$ of Ferrers diagrams which respectively fit into the rectangles $n\times\infty$ and $\infty\times m$, can we construct two other diagrams $(\nu,\eta)\in P_{n,m}\times P_{n+m}$ which respectively fit into the rectangles $n\times m$ and $(n+m)\times\infty$, in such a way that the map $(\lambda,\mu)\mapsto(\nu,\eta)$ is one-to-one? Intuitively, any ""merging"" of $\lambda$ and $\mu$ (or its conjugate $\mu'$) produces an element $\eta\in P_{n+m}$. Of course, since many pairs $(\lambda,\mu)$ would yield the same $\eta$, one needs to ""store"" as much information as possible about $(\lambda,\mu)$ into the partition $\nu$ to make the merging one-to-one. What puzzles me is that only a rectangle $n\times m$ of information seems enough.","['combinatorics', 'q-analogs', 'binomial-coefficients', 'integer-partitions']"

$$\cases{u_t -u_x = u+v \\ v_t + v_x =0 }$$ The second equation here has the general form of $v = \phi \left( x-t \right)$ (derived using the method of characteristics). Then I'm left with the problem $u_t - u_x = u + \phi (x-t)$
which can be written using the method of characteristics (again)
as $u_t = u + \phi(x - t)$ I realize this is some kind of ODE, that I can solve for different values of $x$: 
$$ u = \Psi(x) e^{t} + \Phi(x-t)$$ But when calculating $Pu$ I get 
$$Pu = -{\mathrm{e}}^t\,\frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x^2} \Psi \left(x\right)-{\mathrm{e}}^t\,\frac{\partial }{\partial x} \Psi \left(x\right) $$ And for $Pu$ to nullify, $\Psi$ must be $ C e^{-x}$. Thus $u =  C e^{t-x} +\Phi \left(x - t \right)$. Surely, this solution is valid, but is this as general as it can be?

So if the letter is put in the correct box that implicates that the letter will be given to the proper person. So now: imagine one person gets the right letter, that gives us:

different situations. ${n\choose1}$ because people are different, imagine two people get the right letter, this case leads to:

2737433,Prove that $ f = 0 $ almost everywhere on $ E $ iff $ \int_{E} f = 0 $,"Let $ f $ be a nonnegative measurable function defined on a measurable set $ E $.

Theorem: (Proposition 9 Chapter 4 in Real Analysis 4th edition by Royden). The function $ f = 0 $ almost everywhere on $ E $ iff $ \int_{E} f = 0 $. Proof: (Ideas extracted from Royden). First suppose $ \int_{E} f = 0 $. For every $ n \in \mathbb{N}^{+}$, by Chebyshev Theorem $ 0 \leq m\{x \in E | f(x) \geq 1 /n \} \leq \frac{1}{n} \int_{E} f = 0 $. 
So $ m\{x \in E | f(x) \geq 1 /n \} = 0 $ for all $ n $, so $ f = 0 $ almost everywhere. Now suppose $ f = 0 $ almost everywhere.
Let $ \phi $ be a simple function and $ h $ be a bounded measurable function such that $ m\{x \in E | h(x) \neq 0 \} $ is finite and $ 0 \leq \phi \leq h \leq f $.
Then $ \phi = 0 $ almost everywhere since $ m\{x \in E | \phi(x) \neq 0 \} \leq m\{x \in E | f(x) \neq 0 \} = 0 $.
Hence $ \int_{E} h = 0 $. 
Consequently $ \int_{E} f = 0 $. My question is why does $ \phi = 0 $ almost everywhere implies $ \int_{E} h = 0 $.

2737553,"If $F:S^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ is a nonvanishing smooth function then exists a ""smooth basis""","I think this is easy, but I'm stuck on this problem. I am trying (and failing miserably) to demonstrate the following theorem Theorem: Let $F: S^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ be a nonvanishing smooth
  function. Then  exists smooth functions $G,
 H: S^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ , such that $\{ F(p), G(p), H(p) \}$ is a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$ for every $p$ $\in$ $S^3$ . If $F: S^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ $(F(p) = (F_1(p) , F_2(p) )$ the demonstration would be trivial, we would define $G(p) = (-F_2(p) , F_1(p))$ and and the proof would be ready. For any reason, I can't do this kind of trick in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (I'm just able to do this locally and not globally). Does anyone know some magic trick that demonstrates the existence of the functions $H$ and $G$ ? EDIT: Couple days ago I figured out the solution Solution Using that $S^3$ is a Lie group ( $S^3$ is diffeomorphic to $SU (2) $ ), there is a trivialization of $TS^3$ , i.e. there is a smooth function $$H: S^3 \times \mathbb {R}^3\rightarrow TS^3$$ $$(p,v) \mapsto (p,A_p v),$$ where $A_p$ is a isomorphism of $\mathbb {R}^3$ to $T_p S^3$ . So we can define the following vector field in $S^3$ , $\tilde{F}: S^3 \rightarrow TS^3$ , $\tilde {F}(p) = (p,A_p F (p))$ . Let $F_t (p)$ be the flow of $\tilde {F} $ , i. e; $F_0 (p) = p$ , for all $p$ $\in $ $S^3$ . $\frac {d}{dt} F_t (p) = A_{F_t (p)} F (F_t (p))$ , for all $(t,p)$ $\in$ $\mathbb {R} \times S^3$ .
(Since $S^3$ is compact $\tilde {F} $ has complete flow). Define $T (p,t) = \frac {F (F_t (p))}{\|F (F_t (p)) \|}$ and $G (p) = \left.\frac {d}{dt}T (p,t)\right|_{t=0}$ Finally, $G $ is the required function because \begin{align*}
\left\langle G (p), \frac {F (p)}{\|F (p)\|}\right\rangle &= \left\langle \left.\frac {d}{dt}T (p,t)\right|_{t=0} , T (p,0)\right\rangle\\
&=\frac {1}{2}\left.\frac {d}{dt} \left\langle T (p,t), T (p,t)\right\rangle\right|_{t=0}\\
&=\frac {1}{2}\frac {d}{dt} 1\\
&=0.
\end{align*} $H $ can be taken as the cross product between $F $ and $G $ . Bonus Information: If $F$ is just a continuous function we can find a sequence of smooth functions $\{F_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ ( $F_n: S^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ ), such that $F_n \rightarrow \frac{F}{\|F\|}$ uniformly. Note that if $F_n \rightarrow \frac{F}{\|F\|}$ uniformly, then $\frac{F_n}{\|F_n\|} \rightarrow \frac{F}{\|F\|}$ uniformly. For each $n$ $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$ , there is (by the demonstration of the theorem above) a smooth function $G_n:S^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ , satisfying $\left\langle G_n, F_n \right\rangle = 0 $ . Let $n_0$ be a natural number such that $\left\|\frac{F}{\|F\|} - \frac{F_{n_0}}{\|F_{n_0}\|} \right\|<\frac{1}{2}$ . Realize that \begin{align*}
\left|\left\langle \frac{G_{n_0}(p)}{\|G_{n_0}(p)\|} , \frac{F(p)}{\|F(p)\|}\right\rangle\right|&=  \left|\left\langle \frac{G_{n_0}(p)}{\|G_{n_0}(p)\|} , \frac{F(p)}{\|F(p)\|} - \frac{F_{n_0}(p)}{\|F_{n_0}(p)\|}\right\rangle \right|\\
&\leq \left\|\frac{G_{n_0}(p)}{\|G_{n_0}(p)\|}\right\|\cdot \left\| \frac{F(p)}{\|F(p)\|} - \frac{F_{n_0}(p)}{\|F_{n_0}(p)\|}\right\|\\
&\leq \frac{1}{2}
\end{align*} Then $G_{n_0}(p)$ is l.i with $F(p)$ for every $p$ $\in$ $S^{3}$ (otherwise we would have the existence of $p$ satisfying $\left|\left\langle \frac{G_{n_0}(p)}{\|G_{n_0}(p)\|} , \frac{F(p)}{\|F(p)\|}\right\rangle\right|=1$ ). One more time we can take $H$ as the cross product between $G_{n_0}$ and $F$ .","['differential-topology', 'analysis']"

Let's say that  $L$ is a $\alpha$-good lattice iff 1) It's equipped with a probability mesure, such that principle filters are mesurable sets, and every singleton has mesure $0$. 2) Any element of $L$ is the lower upper bound of some  subset of $JI(R)$ that cardinality is strictly smaller than the continuum Does there exist a good lattice $L$ such that for any $g\in JI(L)$,  almost every  element of $L$ is  greater than $g$ ? Note that if $JI(L)$ is a countable subset of $L$ the answer is no. Motivation Let's say that  a finite lattice $(L,\leq)$ is an $\epsilon$-lattice if  there exists $g\in JI(L)$, such that the (uniform) probability that a random element of $L$ is grater than $g$ is lower then $1-\epsilon$. 
The Frankl conjecture says that any finite lattice is a $1/2$-lattice. Even the question : ""does there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that any finite lattice is an $\epsilon$-lattice"" is an open question for $\epsilon\leq 1/2$. (we will call it the WFC (weak Frankl conjecture). If WFC is wrong than we can find $(L_i,\leq ,0_i)_{i\in \mathbb N}$ and equip $L:=L_0\times L_1\times L_2....$,  with the product mesure $\mathbb P$ of the uniform probabilty mesure on each $L_i$, in such a way that for any $g=(g_0,g_1....)\in JI(L_0)\times JI(L_1)...$, we have $sup_{j\in \mathbb N}\mathbb P(x\in g^j)=1$   (***) where $g^j= \left\{x\in L,\,  (0_0,0_1,...0_{j-1},g_j,g_{j+1}...)\leq x\right\}$. If we consider $M$ the sublattice of $L$ such that no projetion on some $L_i$ is $0_i$, and if we say that for any $a,b\in M$, $a\leq_M b$ iff $a^k\leq b$ for some $k\in \mathbb N$, then the quotient $M^*$ obtained from $M\cup\left\{0\right\}$ by identifying $a$ and $b$ iff $a\leq_M b$ and $b\leq_M a$, is a good lattice when you equip it with the $\mathbb P^*$ in such a way that $\mathbb P^*(A)=\mathbb P(\left\{x\in L,\,\exists y\in A,\,\, y\leq_M x\,\,and\,\, x\leq_M y\right\})$. And if I'm not mistaking, the (***) condition implies that for any $g\in JI(M^*)$ we have $\mathbb P^*(x>g)=1$. [the problem is that $M^*$ is   not generated by $JI(M^*)$ (it is not even complete as a lattice), so in order  make the question fit better with the motivation, one should put instead of condition 2) a weaker hypothesis and just ask  ""new good lattice"" to satisfy  $\sup M^*=\sup K$  for some  $K\subset JI(M^*)$, such that $|K|<|\mathbb R|$.

We can partially characterize the ""skinniness"" of one of the isosceles triangles by the positive natural number $n := \text{(leg length) } - \text{ (base length)}$, with equilateral triangles having skinniness $n = 0$.

$$\cases{\frac{k-2}{k+1} & if $n = 0$, \\ 3 \frac{k-1}{k+1} k^{-n} & if $n > 0$.}$$ It seems reasonable to me that the fraction of triangles with skinniness $n$ falls off exponentially in $n$ with base $k$, but I don't understand why the isosceles expression doesn't extrapolate naturally back to the equilateral case; there are many fewer equilateral triangles than the $3(k-1)/(k+1)$ that we would get from simply extrapolating the $n > 0$ expression back to $n = 0$.

If the answer to the above is yes, is the pair $(P, \Gamma)$ uniquely determined up to gauge transformations, in the sense that if $(P', \Gamma')$ is another such pair then $P$ and $P'$ can be identified as principal bundles and $\Gamma'$ and $\Gamma$ differ by a gauge transformation?

Therefore, by definition of convergence, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac {2n^2+10n+5}{n^2}=2$. Should I say $M\in Z^+$ (because I am worried about the case where $M=0$)? Can you find any mistakes in this proof? Thank you in advance.","['real-analysis', 'limits', 'proof-verification', 'epsilon-delta', 'sequences-and-series']"
2737938,Morse lemma via Moser's trick,"In Abraham and Marsden's Foundations of Mechanics , they prove Morse lemma via Moser's trick. They are able to reduce the proof so that it suffices to find a smooth family of vector fields $Z_t$ such that
$$\iota_{Z_t}\omega_t+(f-g)=0, \quad Z_t(0)=0,$$
where $f$ is the function under consideration in Morse lemma statement, $g(x)=\frac{1}{2}D^2f(0)(x,x)$ and $\omega_t=tdf+(1-t)dg$. Now, the book says that it is ""easy to see that $Z_t$ exists near $0$ by the nondegeneracy hypothesis"", which I assume is referring to the non-degeneracy of the hessian $D^2f(0)$. However, I can't see how it is easy to see that. For instance, $\omega_t(0)$ is $0$, so $Z_t(0)$ could be whatever we want and I see no way to easily reconcile this*. Furthermore, $\omega_t$ is a $1$-form and we want a $Z_t$ such that $\omega_t(Z_t)$ is some number. This gives a lot of redundancy for $Z_t$. My question is: How to build such $Z_t$? *This is quite different from the usage of Moser's trick on the symplectic situations (Darboux's theorem, say), where $\omega_t$, when constant on a region of interest (like the origin in this case), is usually non-degenerate (not to mention being a $2$-form, which is relevant for the next thing I am about to say) For those not familiar, Morse lemma is as follows. Let $f:M \to \mathbb{R}$ be such that $\mathrm{Hess}_p$ is non-degenerate and $f(p)=0$. Then there exists a chart $\phi$ around $p$ such that in local coordinates

I think that it's trivial but I can't see the solution. Let $f,h:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be continuous functions over $\mathbb{R}$. Given that for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$ we have $$0\leq f(x)\leq xh(x)$$ and that the derivative of $xh(x)$ exists at $0$ (in fact, $\big(xh(x)\big)'(0)=h(0)$). Can we conclude that $f'(0)$ exists? Firts, because $0\leq f(0)\leq 0h(0)=0$, we have that $f(0)=0$. Next 
$$f'(0)=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\dfrac{f(x)-f(0)}{x-0}=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\dfrac{f(x)-0}{x}=\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\dfrac{f(x)}{x}.$$
By the inequality of the hypothesis, we have $0\leq \dfrac{f(x)}{x}\leq h(x)$. Thus 
$$0\leq \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\dfrac{f(x)}{x}\leq \lim\limits_{x\to 0} h(x)=h(0).$$

$$f'(-1) = -2,  f'(1) = 2$$ Derivative basically says how much our function will change with respect to little change in its argument. I prefer to think about derivative as the velocity with which function changes in the given point. So the absolute value of the derivative will tell us how much it will change. And the sign of derivative corresponds to the direction in which we should change the argument to get increase in the function(we can do $ x_{next} = x  + hf'(x)$, where $h$ is a small number and we always will get increase in the value of a function) So I do not understand why the derivative(or partial derivative, same stuff) always points in the direction in which we should change the argument to get increase in the function, given that value of derivative tells us the speed of a change of this function?","['derivatives', 'partial-derivative', 'gradient-descent', 'functions', 'slope']"

2738195,Analytic properties of Euler sums,"Introduction As far as I know this topic has not been discussed before. I have found interesting results which I wish to share with you in the standard MSE manner by asking questions. Consider the Euler sum $$S(1,s) =\sum _{k=1}^{\infty } \frac{H_k}{k^s}\tag{1}$$ where $H_k = \sum_{j=1}^k 1/j$ is the harmonic number and $s$ is a parameter which in the field of Euler sums is considered to assume integer values $\ge 2$. Here we let $s$ be a complex number and ask for the analytic properties of $S(1,s)$ as a function of $s$. In parallel and for comparison we consider the similar sum with the harmonic number replaced by unitiy. This is the well known zeta function studied first by Euler $$\zeta(s) = \sum _{k=1}^{\infty } \frac{1}{k^s}\tag{2}$$ The analytic properties of this function have been studied first by Bernhard Riemann in his famous paper on the distribution of prime numbers of 1859 [1]. The zeta function is analytic in the whole complex $s$ plane except for a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue $1$. It has trivial simple zeroes at negative even integers and non trivial zeroes on the line $\Re[s] = 1/2$ possibly even all non trivial zeroes are located on this line (Riemann's hypothesis) [2],[3]. Question 1 What are the singularities of $S(1,s)$ in the complex s-plane? What can be said about the zeroes? Compare the results with those of $\zeta(s)$ First solution steps: derive an integral representation of $S(1,s)$, and split is into an holomorphic and a meromorphic part. Study the meromorphic part to find the singularities. Question 2 $S(1,q)$ has a well known closed form for integer argument $q = 2, 3, 4, ..$ which was already found by Euler. It is given by $$S_E(1,q) = \left(\frac{q}{2}+1\right) \zeta (q+1)-\frac{1}{2} \sum _{k=1}^{q-2} \zeta (k+1) \zeta (q-k)\tag{3}$$ The question asks for a possible closed form for real $q \ge 2$ First solution steps: Here I have no idea how to find a better solution than the integral representation. Question 3 Consider the analogue questions 1 and 2 also for the general linear harmonic sum including the generating function via the parameter $x$ $$S_H(p, q, x)=\sum _{k=1}^{\infty } \frac{x^k H_k^{(p)}}{k^q}\tag{4}$$ Here $H_k^{(p)}=\sum_{n=1}^k 1/n^p$ is the generalized harmonic number. As there are three quantities in the game, to be definite, we consider some simplifying cases. Case 1: $x=1$ and $x=-1$ (alternating sum) for fixed $p$ as a function of $q$ Case 2: fixed $x$ and $p=q$ as a function of $p$. Notice that there is an analogous formula to (3) for integer $p$ Case 3: $X$ fixed somewhere within the interval $(-1,1)$, e.g. $x=\frac{1}{2}$ and, say, $p=1$.

I am not sure if I am missing out something in the solution. Please check if it's correct. My partial solution (not sure if it adds any value) : If $k$ is odd there's a clear contradiction since an even number can't divide an odd number, which shows $k$ is even. This shows that $k+1$ is odd, meaning, it has got all odd prime divisors. Let $p$ be an odd prime dividing it. Since $k$ is even, observe that $2^{k}$ is a squared number and $2^{k}\equiv -1 \pmod{p}$. By the theorem stated here we see that $p = 4x+1$ for some $x$.

2738419,"Intuitively (or precisely), which functions can be approximated by straight lines?","I am trying to build up some intuition of what the various notions of analysis mean. By intuition of continuity is that it means the graph of the function is 'connected', but not necessarily in any nice way. This lead me to ask the question 'Given a function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$, what assumptions must we impose on $f$ so that we can say $f$ is 'approximately a line' in some neighbourhood of $x_0$?' To apply Taylor's theorem, we need that $f$ is twice continuously differentiable at $x_0$. However I am only interested in some tiny neighbourhood of $x_0$, so can we weaken these assumptions? We certainly can't weaken them all the way down to continuity at $x_0$; for example the function $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by
$$g(x) = \begin{cases}
x \sin(\frac{1}{x}), \ x \neq 0 \\
0, \qquad \quad \ x=0
\end{cases}$$
is continuous at $x_0 = 0$, but certainly cannot be approximated by a line there. Differentiability at $x_0$ also won't do; consider $h: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ given by
$$h(x) = \begin{cases}
x^2 \sin(\frac{1}{x}), \ x \neq 0 \\
0, \qquad \quad \ \ \ x=0.
\end{cases}$$
This is differentiable and hence continuous at $x_0 = 0$. Indeed it is differentiable everywhere, but it is not continuously differentiable at $0$; it's derivative is $h': \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ given by
$$h'(x) = \begin{cases}
2x\sin(\frac{1}{x}) - \cos(\frac{1}{x}), \ x \neq 0 \\
0, \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad x=0
\end{cases}$$
whose limit at $0$ doesn't exist. Going one step further, we consider $k: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ given by 
$$k(x) = \begin{cases}
x^3 \sin(\frac{1}{x}), \ x \neq 0 \\
0, \qquad \quad \ \ \ x=0.
\end{cases}$$
Again this is differentiable everywhere, but now it is continuously differentiable at $0$ (and so everywhere); it's derivative is $k': \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ given by
$$k'(x) = \begin{cases}
3x^2\sin(\frac{1}{x}) - x\cos(\frac{1}{x}), \ x \neq 0 \\
0, \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ x=0
\end{cases}$$
which is continuous everywhere. However this function obviously still can't be approximated by a straight line near $0$ (since it takes on positive, negative, and zero values arbitrarily near the origin, and a straight line through the origin can only take on positive, negative, $\textit{or}$ zero values near the origin). At first I thought the problem was that the value of the derivatives of $g, h$ and $k$ around $x_0 = 0$ were unbounded, i.e. their 'slopes' grow without bound, however this is only the case for $g$; the derivative of $h$ near $0$ is approximately between $-1$ and $1$ and the derivative of $k$ near $0$ is approximately $0$. Then I thought the problem was that that the derivatives of $g, h,$ and $k$ had arbitrarily many sign changes near $x_0 = 0$, however this also can't be right. So now I'm just confused. Do we in fact need all the assumptions warranted by Taylor's theorem, i.e. twice continuously differentiable at $x_0$, to guarantee that a function is 'like a line' at a point? Do we actually need more hypotheses than Taylor's theorem in that we have to assume information about $f$ not at $x_0$, i.e. in some neighbourhood? Thanks in advance. I also wouldn't mind comments explaining your intuitions about related notions in analysis. tl;dr: what restrictions must we place on a function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ so that when we 'zoom in close enough', it looks like a straight line?","['derivatives', 'intuition', 'functions', 'continuity', 'analysis']"

So I wouldn't be surprised if the result fails for $U$ but holds for $X$.","['connectedness', 'separable-spaces', 'continuum-theory', 'compactness', 'general-topology']"
2739098,The $n$-astrolabacus sequence.,"The Details: The astrolabacus is a puzzle said to have $$A_3:=\frac{18!\times 2^{18}}{3!^6}=35,972,733,468,672,000$$ possible positions. Here is a GIF of the puzzle moving: There are six segments that each contain six coloured balls: three per coloured half segment. Those segments can be moved as above and there are loops of $18$ balls that one can slide into different positions. There are four colours, like so: A solution to the puzzle is described here . Definition 1: The $n$ -astrolabacus is an astrolabacus where, instead of $3$ balls per half segment, there are $n$ balls. Let $A_n$ be the number of different positions of the $n$ -astrolabacus. The Question: What is $A_n$ in terms of $n\in\Bbb N$ ? This sequence is not in the OEIS. My Attempt: Well, when $n=3$ , quoting this article , we have that [t]he puzzle is symmetrical, and remains so even when it changes its shape ( $180$ degree rotational symmetry around a central axis). The balls therefore occur in pairs which remain opposite each other. There are four colours (red, blue, green, yellow), and the tunnels are coloured in such a way that every pair occurs exactly once. There are $18$ pairs coloured balls (sic) which can be permuted in $18!$ ways. The balls of a pair can also be swapped, so there are (at most) $18!\times 2^{18}$ ways to arrange them all. There are however indistinguishable ball pairs - there are $6$ pairs of colours, all occurring three times. This gives the number quoted in the details. Building on this, I conjecture that $$A_n=\frac{2^{6n}(6n)!}{n!^6}.$$ Is this correct? It seems like it's just a matter of replacing $18$ by $6n$ in the argument above. The expression $\frac{2^{6n}(6n)!}{n!^6}$ is an integer since $n!$ divides any product of $n$ consecutive integers. Please help :)","['combinatorics', 'recreational-mathematics']"
2739099,Reluctant roots: $n$ is a primitive root of $p$ but not of $p^2$,"I was looking at the primitive roots $n \bmod p$ and $p^2$ to see how often we get primitive roots of a prime that are not primitive roots of the square of that prime. I'll call this a reluctant root of $p$. It's really rare. With $p$ limited to a little under $38000$, I didn't find any such cases at all for $n<10$. In particular I started out looking specifically for cases when $2$ is a reluctant root, and finding none I widened the search. The first case I found was $n=11, p=71$, when I was just looking at $n$ prime, but there is also a case for $n=10, p=487$. In these cases, as in most others, and taking only $n<p,$ this was the only such case despite many hundreds of primes for which $n$ was a primitive root. Searching the other way around, looking for reluctant roots of various primes $p,$ I found that in the first $400$ primes, which have a total of $190111$ primitive roots, there are only $143$ reluctant roots across $122$ primes. Most primes have no reluctant roots; the first few primes that have reluctant roots are $29, 37, 43, 71, 103, 109, 113, 131\ldots$; even fewer ($18$ in this range) have more than $1$, with $653$ taking the golden cupcake (so far) with $4$ reluctant roots - $84, 120, 287, 410$. Main question: what is the smallest prime that has $2$ as a reluctant root, or is there no such prime? Other questions: why are reluctant roots so rare? and is there any more investigative work on these (perhaps under a less Harry-Potteresque name)?","['number-theory', 'primitive-roots']"
2739105,What happens with subdivisions of normal fans in Sage?,"I've been trying to compute specific subdivisions of a particular 4D complete fan, to try to speed up computations I have started looking into using Sage. The problem I'm having is that I would like to compute subdivisions without adding new rays, and I would like to pick which of the existing rays get subdivided (and in what order). My specific problem is that I want to look at the normal fan of the polytope P4: sage: P4=Polyhedron( vertices=[[-2,0,1,1],[0,1,1,1],[2,0,1,1],[-1,-1,1,1],
      [1,-1,1,1],[-1,-1,-1,1],[1,-1,-1,1],[0,0,0,-1]])
sage: P4
A 4-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices This polytope has nonsimplicial 2 dimensional faces, which should give corresponding 3 dimensional cones in the normal fan: sage: P4.faces(2)

(1, 6, 7) Something that has gone well is that I obtained a 4D fan with 8 rays. However, my two nonsimplicial 2-faces in P4 (one of which had 5 vertices!) have become three nonsimplicial 3-cones in fan (all of which have only 4 vertices!). This indicates that I don't actually know what this code does, since I should have obtained an identical list, up to relabeling of vertices/rays. I reach another problem when I try to compute star subdivisions at existing rays: sage: for cone in fan(1): print([cone.rays(),cone.ambient_ray_indices()])

(0, 1, 7) So I have tried to compute a star subdivision at ray 4, which should ""simplicialize"" all three nonsimplicial 3-cones in this fan. However, we see that nothing has changed. This suggests to me that the subdivision command can only subdivide at new rays, which is not what I need. So my main questions are: 1) Why doesn't my fan correspond to the polytope I started with? 2) Is there a way to do subdivisions without adding new rays? 3) Is the problem that I'm trying to use Sage, and should I be looking for a different way to try to compute these types of objects?","['combinatorics', 'sagemath', 'toric-geometry', 'polytopes']"
