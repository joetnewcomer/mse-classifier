86493,What does the minimal eigenvalue of a graph say about the graph's connectivity?,"I'm reading Fan Chung's Spectral Graph Theory , and I'm now in chapter 2.  There, Chung proves Cheeger's inequality , which is that $2h_G \geq \lambda_1 > h_G^2/2$ for any graph $G$.  To me, this inequality raises the question of a physical interpretation of $\lambda_1$ and I'm wondering if such an interpretation exists.  Below, I'll explain this terminology and ask my question a little more precisely. Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V$, with $\#V =n$.  The Laplacian of $G$ is the $n\times n$ matrix $\mathcal{L}$ whose $(u,v)^{\text{th}}$ entry is $\text{deg}(v)$ if $u=v$, $-(\text{deg}(u)\text{deg}(v))^{-1/2}$ if $u$ and $v$ are adjacent vertices, and $0$ otherwise.  The eigenvalues of $\mathcal{L}$ are called the eigenvalues of $G$ and are denoted by $\lambda_0 \leq \lambda_1 \leq \dots \leq \lambda_{n-1}$.  It's not too hard to show that $\lambda_0$ is always $0$, so we normally refer to $\lambda_1$ as the minimal eigenvalue of $G$. If $S\subset V$ (with $S\neq V$) then we define $\overline{S} := V-S$ and $E(S,\overline{S})$ to be the set of edges of $G$ with one vertex in $S$ and the other in $\overline{S}$.  Also, let the volume of $S$ be defined as $\text{vol}(S) := \sum_{v \in S} \text{deg}(v)$. We then define $$ h_G(S) := \frac{\# E(S,\overline{S})}{\text{min}(\text{vol}(S),\text{vol}(\overline{S}))}.$$  The Cheeger constant of $G$ is defined to be $h_G := \min_{S \subset V} h_G(S)$. It's clear from the definition that the Cheeger constant measures how much the graph ""bottlenecks"" somewhere (to borrow Wikipedia's apt description).  Loosely speaking, if Cheeger's constant is small then there's a small set of edges that you can remove from the graph to disconnect it into two relatively large and relatively connected subgraphs. Now, it doesn't seem like $\lambda_1$ (which equals the minimal Rayleigh quotient over the space of harmonic eigenfunctions) would have much of a physical interpretation.  However,  Cheeger's inequality traps $\lambda_1$ fairly close to $h_G$, so it is some loose measure of bottlenecking.  Also, there are other little hints in the text I've read so far that $\lambda_1$ might be related to the graph's connectedness.  For instance, she proves $\lambda_1 = 0$ if and only if $G$ is disconnected and that $\lambda_1 \geq 1/D\text{vol}(G)$, where $D$ is the length of the maximal-length path in $G$. So I'm wondering if there is a meaningful physical interpretation of $\lambda_1$ that is more precise than ""it's bounded near something that is meaningful.""","['graph-theory', 'spectral-graph-theory', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'combinatorics']"

86535,Alternate strategies to central moments to characterise distributions,"Assume a single real-valued variable, and frequent irregular observations of its value over a series of time-spans.  In each time span, I'm assuming the samples are from a distribution of values which the variable assumes during that time span... I intend to compare distributions between time-spans, hoping to find patterns that are otherwise obscured by the detail of the irregular sampling. The most obvious way I can see to characterise these distributions is the first n central moments... so, for example, I can calculate approximations of the Mean, Variance, Skew and Kurtosis for the sample data.  I am aware, however, of distributions which do not have meaningful definitions of central moments (Cauchy distributions, for example) and recognise that trying to characterise such a distribution by approximated central moments is unlikely to provide useful insights.

86596,How rare are the primes $p$ such that $p$ divides the sum of all primes less than $p$?,"This is just for fun! The title pretty much says it all. It's probably a very difficult question. Up to the $40,000^{th}$ prime $(479909)$, I have found only $5$, $71$ and $369119$ with this property. Somebody with better hardware than me might have better luck! Edit: Sivaram Ambikasaran has checked that these are the only ones up to $10^8$, i.e. up to the $5761455^{th}$ prime (see the comments). (Here is a very naive heuristic: if we suppose the sum $S_n$ of primes less than $p_n$ to be randomly distributed mod $p_n$, it will be divisible by $p_n$ with probability $1/p_n$. Hence the function $f$ given by $$f(n) = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{ if } p_n \mid S_n, \\ 0, &\text{ otherwise.} \end{cases}$$ should have expected value $1/p_n$, and hence I'd expect the series $\displaystyle\sum_{n\geq 1}f(n)$ to diverge very slowly, like the sum of reciprocals of the primes, which is approximately $\log \log n$... but then again, such an argument is more or less worthless.)

86604,divisor class group of a product of schemes,"The first part of this question is quite general: let $X$ and $Y$ be noetherian integral separated schemes which are regular in codimension one. Is there any relationship between the divisor class group $\text{Cl}(X \times Y)$ and the groups $\text{Cl}(X)$, $\text{Cl}(Y)$? For instance, I think there are natural maps on divisors $\text{Div}(X) \to \text{Div}(X \times Y)$ and $\text{Div}(Y) \to \text{Div}(X \times Y)$ which send $Z \mapsto Z \times Y$ and $Z \mapsto X \times Z$. Are these maps well-defined modulo linear equivalence? If so, are the induced maps on class groups injective? This question occurred to me while working on Hartshorne exercise II.6.1, which claims that $\text{Cl}(X \times \mathbb{P}^n) \cong \text{Cl}(X) \times \mathbb{Z}$. In this case, taking $H_{\infty} \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ to be the hyperplane at infinity, $Z = X \times H_{\infty}$, and $U = X \setminus Z$, there is a natural surjection $\text{Cl}(X \times \mathbb{P}^n) \to \text{Cl}(U) \cong \text{Cl}(X)$ whose kernel is the image of the map $\mathbb{Z} \to \text{Cl}(X \times \mathbb{P}^n)$ which sends $n \mapsto n \cdot Z$.

86687,"Limit of $1/x^2$ - Apostol 3.2, Example 4","In Apostol, One Variable Calculus Volume 1, section 3.2, page 130, he gives the following example (roughly paraphrased): Let $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$ if $x \neq 0$ , and let $f(0) = 0$ . To prove rigorously that there is no real number $A$ such that $\lim_{x\to0^+} f(x)=A$ , we may argue as follows: Suppose there were such an $A$ , say $A>0$ . Choose a neighborhood $N(A)$ of length $1$ . In the interval $0 < x < \frac{1}{A + 2}$ , we have $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} > (A + 2)^2 > (A + 2)$ , so $f(x)$ cannot lie in the neighborhood $N(A)$ .
Thus, every neighborhood $N(0)$ contains points $x > 0$ for which $f(x)$ is outside $N(A)$ , so
(3.3) is violated for this choice of $N(A)$ . Hence $f$ has no right-hand limit at $0$ . While I intuitively understand why the function has no limit, I'm completely lost on his proof. What justifies him from moving from $f(x)$ lies outside of $N(A)$ for the neighborhood $0 < x < \frac{1}{A+2}$ to $f(x)$ lies outside every neighborhood? The way I've been thinking about it is to translate the proof into terms from the $ε-δ$ definition. Thus, when he says ""in the interval $0 < x < \frac{1}{A+2}$ "", he's setting $ε = \frac{1}{A+2}$ , and then showing that $f(x)$ lies outside of $|f(x) - A| < ε$ for $|x-0| < δ$ . But, if we were to prove that there is no limit, we have to show that for some $ε$ , no $δ$ works. He says this in, ""Thus, every neighborhood $N(0)$ contains points..."", but I don't see how he can move from ""this $δ$ doesn't work"" to ""no $δ$ works"". The best I can come up with is that either I'm making a mistake in thinking he's choosing $δ = \frac{1}{A+2}$ , or that particular $δ$ is supposed to be a catch all. That is, if any $δ$ will work, this one should. But if that is the case, I don't see why this $δ$ has to be the one that works. Thanks in advance.","['calculus', 'limits']"

But $x \in J$ and $J$ is an ideal so $ax \in J$ and as $I \subseteq J$, $ax - (ax-1) = 1 \in J$; this implies $J = R$. Now, consider $I$ maximal and $(I+a) \neq I$. This means $a \notin I$ so consider the ideal $I + <a>$ (the principal ideal generated by $a$) which obviously contains $I$. It follows that the ideal must be $R$ so there exist $i \in I$, $r \in R$ such that the following holds;
$$
i + ra = 1
$$ as $1 \in R$. Thus $I + (i+ra) = I + 1$, so $I + ra = I + 1 = (I+a)(I+r)$ hence $I+a \in R/I$ does indeed have an inverse if $a$ is non zero. Let $R/I$ be an integral domain. Neccesarily $I \neq R$. Let $xy \in I$. Then $(I+xy) = I = (I+x)(I+y)$ so as $R/I$ is an integral domain this implies $x$ or $y$ is in $I$, hence $I$ is prime. Now, let $I$ be prime. Suppose $(I+x)(I+y) = I$. Then $I+xy = I$ hence $xy$ is in $I$ so $x \in I$ or $y \in I$ so $I+x$ or $I+y$ is $I$ (which is zero). A field is an integral domain thus $I$ maximal implies $I$ is prime.","['commutative-algebra', 'ideals', 'abstract-algebra']"

86909,Nicer Description of Germs of Continuous Functions,"I may be asking something a little out of my comfort zone at this moment so bear with me. Before I begin let me provide some background for the interested outsider: Let $X$ be a topological space and fix some $x\in X$. We can consider the set $\mathcal{U}_x$ of all neighborhoods of $x$ in $X$. This is a directed set with the reverse inclusion ordering $\subseteq_{\text{op}}$. We can note then that if we consider the set $\{C(U,\mathbb{R})\}_{U\in\mathcal{U}_x}$ (where each $C(U,\mathbb{R})$ denotes, as usual, the set of continuous maps $U\to\mathbb{R}$ where we are thinking about it as a $\mathbb{R}$-space) and the set $\{\text{res}_{U,V}:C(U,\mathbb{R})\to C(V,\mathbb{R})\}_{U,V\in\mathcal{U}_x,\; U\subseteq_\text{op}V}$ (where $\text{res}_{U,V}:C(U,\mathbb{R})\to C(V,\mathbb{R})$ is the restriction map taking $C(U,\mathbb{R})\ni f\mapsto f_{\mid V}\in C(V,\mathbb{R})$) then we have a nice directed system of $\mathbb{R}$-spaces. We can then consider the direct limit $\varinjlim C(U;\mathbb{R})$ to get a $\mathbb{R}$-space. Call this space the germs of continuous functions at $x$ and denote it $\mathcal{G}_x$. It's not hard to prove (it's intuitively obvious from the direct limit definition) that $\mathcal{G}_x$ admits a different description as $C(X,\mathbb{R})/\sim$ where $f\sim g$ if and only if there exists $U\in\mathcal{U}_x$ with $f_{\mid U}=g_{\mid U}$ and we add/multiply scalars representative wise. Anyways, so I completely understand (or at least I hope I do) the intuitive idea behind the germ of continuous functions. That said, I have a hard time actually computing it except for very extreme scenarios. For example, if $x$ is an isolated point of $X$ I see quite clearly that $\mathcal{G}_x\to\mathbb{R}:[f]\mapsto f(x)$ is a well-defined isomorphism. But, in general, I have no idea how to find nice descriptions of the germs of functions at a point.

If $f(t)=P(t)/Q(t)$ for some polynomials $P(t)$ and $Q(t)\neq 0$, then the map $t\mapsto t+1$ sends $f(t)$ to $f(t+1)$. So the fixed field for this map the set of rational functions $P(t)/Q(t)$ such that

\frac{P(t)}{Q(t)}=\frac{P(t+1)}{Q(t+1)}\text{ or }P(t)Q(t+1)=P(t+1)Q(t).

This does not seem awfully descriptive. Is there a more explicit description of what the fixed field looks like, (perhaps in terms of the form of $P$ and $Q$?), in order to get a better handle on it?

What happens when $k$ is not algebraically closed? I think you can still factor out polynomials of form $\phi_\alpha$ for $\alpha$ roots of $f$ in $k$. But if $f$ does not split completely then there will be some $\sigma$-invariant factor with not roots in $k$ in the factorization of $f$.

For example: $\displaystyle{\int_0^\infty a e^{-a t} \left(1-e^{-b t}\right) \left(1-e^{-c t}\right) \left(1-e^{-d t}\right) \left(1-e^{-e t}\right) \left(1-e^{-f t}\right) \, dt}$ , gives the following in Mathematica: $a \left[\displaystyle{\frac{1}{a}-\frac{1}{a+b}-\frac{1}{a+c}+\frac{1}{a+b+c}-\frac{1}{a+d}+\frac{1}{a+b+d}+\frac{1}{a+c+d}-\frac{1}{a+b+c+d}-} \right.$ $\left. \displaystyle{\frac{1}{a+e}+\frac{1}{a+b+e}+\frac{1}{a+c+e}-\frac{1}{a+b+c+e}+\frac{1}{a+d+e}-\frac{1}{a+b+d+e}-\frac{1}{a+c+d+e}+} \right.$ $\left. \displaystyle{\frac{1}{a+b+c+d+e}-\frac{1}{a+f}+\frac{1}{a+b+f}+\frac{1}{a+c+f}-\frac{1}{a+b+c+f}+\frac{1}{a+d+f}-\frac{1}{a+b+d+f}- }\right.$ $\left. \displaystyle{\frac{1}{a+c+d+f}+\frac{1}{a+b+c+d+f}+\frac{1}{a+e+f}-\frac{1}{a+b+e+f}-\frac{1}{a+c+e+f}+\frac{1}{a+b+c+e+f}-} \right.$ $\left. \displaystyle{\frac{1}{a+d+e+f}+\frac{1}{a+b+d+e+f}+\frac{1}{a+c+d+e+f}-\frac{1}{a+b+c+d+e+f}} \right]$ . The trouble is that this expression takes exponential time in the number of coupons to evaluate and has an exponential number of terms. We are looking for a way to bound this asymptotically in $k$ , but any further references or information would be greatly appreciated.","['coupon-collector', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

87169,$\mathbb Z[\sqrt 3]$ contains infinitely many units,"I'm asked to show that there are infinitely many units in the ring $\mathbb Z[\sqrt 3]$. But I don't really see a good approach to this one, so far. Some thoughts: The inverse of $a+\sqrt3 b$ should be given by $\pm(2 - \sqrt 3 b)$, since the norm $$N: \mathbb Z[\sqrt{3}] \to \mathbb Z, \qquad N(x+\sqrt{3} y) = x^2 - 3y^2$$ is multiplicative. So if $(a+\sqrt{3}b)^{-1}=x+\sqrt 3 y$, then 
 $$1 = N(1) = N((a+\sqrt{3}b)(x + \sqrt{3}y)) = (a^2 - 3b^2)(x^2 - 3y^2)$$ Hence we must have $\pm 1 = (a^2 - 3b^2) = (a+\sqrt{3}b)(a-\sqrt{3}b)$. Therefore I need to show that there are infinitely many $a,b$ such that $a^2 - 3b^2 = \pm 1$. Here I don't know how to proceed. Maybe rewriting as $a = \sqrt{3b^2 \pm 1}$, and now trying to prove that there are infinitely many $b$ for which $3b^2 \pm 1$ is a square?

87174,Closed sets as compact sets,"While playing around with some basic general topology, I have thought of some problems whose solutions are not so obvious (at least to me), and surprisingly I do not remember having seen these anywhere. Disclaimer #1 : I have already posted those problems elsewhere , but I was unlucky and received no answer. Disclaimer #2 : The French and English notions of compact sets are notoriously different. I will try to write it right (and it might be actually easier in English). So, let us take any topological space $(X, T)$. As a matter of prophylaxy, I will assume that $X$ is not empty. A subset $K$ of $X$ is said to be compact if, from any covering of $K$ by open sets one can extract a finite sub-cover. My first question is: When are the compact subsets for the topology $T$ the closed subsets for another topology $T^*$ (modulo the whole space $X$)? Trivially, any finite union of compact subsets is compact. If any intersection of compact subsets is compact, then the set of compact subsets plus $X$ are the closed subsets for some topology $T^*$ on $X$. One can see the open subsets of $(X,T^*)$ as the open neighborhoods of infinity for the Alexandroff compactification of $(X, T)$, without said infinity. If $(X,T)$ is Hausdorff then any intersection of compact sets is compact (this is because the compact sets are then closed). However, this condition is not necessary: with the coarse or cofinite topology, any subset is compact, so that any intersection of compact subsets is compact. Do the topological spaces for which this property holds have a name, or a characterization? My second question is: Assuming that the property discussed above is satisfied, is there anything interesting to be said about the operation $T \to T^*$? For instance, if $T$ has the property that any intersection of compact subsets is compact, then does $T^*$ have the same property? This would be important as it would allow us to iterate the operation $T \to T^*$. In addition, it looks like $T^*$ can be seen, in some cases, as a dual topology on $X$. If $T$ is the coarse topology on $X$, then $T^*$ is the discrete topology, and $T^{**}$ is the cofinite topology. Then the sequence stabilizes, as $T^{***}$ is again the discrete topology. In a similar way, If $T$ is the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}^d$, I think (I have not written down the argument properly) that $T=T^{**}$. Are those special cases, or is there a more general pattern?",['general-topology']
87196,Family of univalent functions closed under normal convergence?,"I am encountering a question in complex analysis that is giving me somewhat of a hard time. Here it is: Say that $\mathcal{S}$ is a family of univalent functions $f(z)$ defined on the open unit disk $\{|z| <1 \}$ that satisfy $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$. We are asked to show that $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under normal convergence, i.e., if a sequence in $\mathcal{S}$ converges normally to $f(z)$, then $f \in \mathcal{S}$. Now by definition I know that a sequence of functions $f_n \rightarrow f$ normally on a domain $D$ if $f_n \rightarrow f$ uniformly on a compact subset of  $D$. Also, a function is univalent on a domain $D$ if it is one-to-one and analytic on $D$. So what approach should I take in order to prove this question?

There was a hint provided with the problem, but I am not sure how to utilize it (something along the lines of trying to find sequences $p_n,q_n$ such the $\lim \;d(p_n,q_n) = \sup\{d(p,q) \mid p,q \in E \}$. I guess showing that $\max\{d(x,y) \mid x,y \in E\}$ exists is equivalent to showing that $\{d(x,y) \mid x,y \in E\}$ is compact. I tried to do this by defining function $f_{p_0} = d(x,p_0)$ for some point $p_0 \in E$. Since $E$ is compact, $f_{p_0}(E)$ will be compact, therefore closed and bounded and will have a maximum. I can do this over every point in $E$. But, $E$ could be uncountable, so I will end up with uncountably many functions all of whose images would be compact but the maximum I am looking for would be in the union of all the images (closed and bounded), which need not be closed or bounded. So, I am not sure how to procced at this point. Any suggestions?",['analysis']

How can I do so while preventing any sort of clustering around poles or the center of the sphere? Since I'm unable to answer my own question, here's another solution: Using the strategy suggested by Wolfram MathWorld for picking points on the surface of a sphere: Let $\theta$ be randomly distributed real numbers over the interval $[0,2\pi]$, let $\phi=\arccos(2v−1)$ where $v$ is a random real number over the interval $[0,1]$, and let $r=R_s (\mathrm{rand}(0,1))^\frac13$. Converting from spherical coordinates, a random point in $(x,y,z)$ inside the sphere would therefore be: $((r\cos(\theta)\sin(\phi)),(r\sin(\theta)\sin(\phi)),(r\cos(\phi)))$. A quick test with a few thousand points in the unit sphere appears to show no clustering.  However, I'd appreciate any feedback if someone sees a problem with this approach.","['geometry', 'random']"

87277,"Proof that ideals in $C[0,1]$ are of the form $M_c$ that should not involve Zorn's Lemma","I am learning abstract algebra by myself using Dummit & Foote, and sometimes by working very hard I find very complicated non-proofs of things and I have no idea if they are the best or the worst ideas for those kind of things out there (obviously if they're not working they're probably wrong, but maybe not!). So I feel like talking about it and see what the audience thinks about it. Hence I am asking for a full solution only if you don't feel like giving a hint. If a hint has been given please don't try to come up with the answer and wait for me to accept. So here's the exercise (page 259, Dummit & Foote's Abstract Algebra) : Let $R = C[0,1]$ with addition and multiplication as the ring operations. For each $c \in [0,1]$ define $M_c = \{ f \in R \, | \, f(c) = 0 \}$. It can be easily seen that $M_c$ is a maximal ideal of $R$ because $f(x) = (x-c) \in M_c$ and if $g \notin M_c$ then $g(c) \neq 0$, thus $f^2 > 0$ everywhere except at $c$ and $g^2(c)> 0$, hence $f^2 + g^2$ is a strictly positive continuous function, and since any ideal $I$ such that $M_c \subsetneq I \triangleleft R$ is such that $(M_c,g) \subseteq I$, $f^2 + g^2 \in (M_c,g)$, thus $f^2 + g^2$ is a unit in $(M_c,g)$ and that means that for every $g \notin M_c$, $R = (M_c, g) = I$. Using this trick with $f^2 + g^2$ I wanted to show the following : Prove that if $M$ is any maximal ideal of $R$ then there is a real number $c \in [0,1]$ such that $M = M_c$. I tried considering $K(g) = \{ c \in [0,1] \, | \, g(c) = 0 \}$ and then defining decreasing sequences $K(g) \supsetneq K(g_1) \supsetneq K(g_2) \supseteq \dots$ (using the $f^2 + g^2$ trick) and then looking at the intersection of all those $K$'s but that got me to the weird need of using Zorn's Lemma and got me depressed after multiple tries. Also tried to use the fact that $R/M_c$ is a field but even if I had shown that it was isomorphic to $\mathbb R$ it wasn't clear what I could do in that direction so I gave up pretty fast on that one.
