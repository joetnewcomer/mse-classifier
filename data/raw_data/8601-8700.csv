65037,Do the maximum and minimum values of a Laplacian eigenfunction have the same magnitude?,"Let $\Delta$ be the scalar Laplace-Beltrami operator on a compact, connected, orientable 2-manifold without boundary smoothly embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $\phi$ be one of its eigenfunctions, i.e., $$ \Delta \phi = \lambda \phi $$ for some constant $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$.  Is there any reason to believe that the maximum and minimum pointwise values of $\phi$ have the same magnitude?  This statement certainly holds for simple domains like $S^1$ (where the eigenfunctions are just $\cos(nx)$ and $\sin(nx)$, $n \in \mathbb{Z}$) and also appears to be true empirically (e.g., if you numerically compute eigenfunctions of triangulated surfaces).  But I have trouble seeing why it would be true in general. One thing to note is that the eigenfunctions of $\Delta$ are orthogonal with respect to the $L^2$ inner product.  In particular, the constant function is always an eigenfunction of $\Delta$, which means all other eigenfunctions will have zero mean.  Unfortunately zero mean does not guarantee that the max and min have equal magnitude.","['spectral-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'differential-geometry']"

65043,How to know if a number is a power of $x$,"I couldn't find anything on the Internet which could direct me to the solution of the following problem. I want to know if $n$ can be calculated by $x^y$ where $y\ge 2$ and $x\ge 2$. I tried using $n$ modulus $x$, but this didn't worked out. I'll use this formula in a computer application, the application must be able to apply this formula on numbers greater than $10^{14}$. So the question is: Is there a formula to check if $n$ can be calculated by $x^y$? Any hints, links and answers are appreciated. If you need more information, please feel free to ask. Greetings, Mixxiphoid Update: In my application I have a given number n , this can be really anything. Anything here means larger than 1 and smaller than a number with one million digits, which is a pretty big range. Now I need to know if n can be calculated with any power (NOT a product). Example: if n = 27. The formula should return true with: x = 3, y = 3. if n = 12. The formula should return false. since it can only be calculated with products. if n = 64. The formula should return true with: x = 2, y = 6. NOTE: I need the smallest x. In the third example x could have been 8 with y = 2. But since I want the smallest x , I want x to be 2. I need to know whether it is true or false. If the formula returns true, I also need to know x . In all cases n , x and y should be positive whole numbers!

65180,What is it that makes this proof about rational rectangles work fundamentally?,"I saw this problem several years ago, and I discovered a solution to it. I've since learned a somewhat more efficient solution based on the same idea. Call a rectangle in the $(x,y)$ plane rational if it has sides parallel to the axes and at least one of its sidelengths is rational. Suppose $R$ is a rectangle which can be disected into a finite collection of rational rectangles (i.e., they cover and intersect only on their boundaries). Show $R$ is rational. The rather elegant solution (not by me, but similar to mine) to this problem is as follows. First, scale up the whole picture by the least common denominator of all the rational sidelengths, so each rectangle in the disection has an integer sidelength. Then integrate $\sin{(2 \pi x)} \sin{(2 \pi y)}$ over $R$. Via the dissection, the integral is clearly $0$, and hence $R$ must be rational. The only things this proof need are the fundamental theorem of calculus and the antiderivative of $\sin$. For quite a while, I was satisfied with this solution. The machinery of the integral surprisingly has all the necessary tools to prove this. But now I want to understand what it is that makes this proof work. I've tried to unpack this proof into a sequence of simple statements, but I find that it always seems to get more complicated. Hence, I ask, is there a way to simultaneously simplify this argument and avoid calculus (with an argument similar to this one, not a totally new one)? Is there a way to unpack some of the definitions to make this argument more transparent?","['geometry', 'multivariable-calculus', 'alternative-proof']"

65208,"If a continuous function is positive on the rationals, is it positive almost everywhere?","I made up this question, but unable to solve it: Let $f : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be a continuous function such that $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb Q$. Is it necessary that $f(x) > 0$ almost everywhere? This is my attempt. It is easy to show that $f(x) \geq 0$ everywhere, so the real question is whether $f$ can be zero at an ""almost all"" irrational points. The function can become $0$ at isolated points, e.g., $f(x) = (x - \sqrt{2})^2$. In particular, the qualification ""almost"" is necessary for the question to be nontrivial. Every rational point has an open neighborhood where $f$ is positive. Hence at least know that the set $\{ x \,:\, f(x) > 0 \}$ is not a measure-zero set. I first mistakenly assumed that Thomae's function provides a counter-example to this. Indeed, it is positive at all rationals and zero at all irrationals, but the function is continuous at only the irrationals, not everywhere. Then I tried to prove that the question has an affirmative answer, but do not have much progress there. Please suggest some hints!","['measure-theory', 'examples-counterexamples', 'real-analysis']"

PS: This problem is from Rudin's book in Ch.10. So, I just know some basic theorems about holomorphic functions.(I don't know anything about harmonic functions or conformal mapping, which I will learn in later chapters) Something I tried: Since I don't know how to solve this problem with arbitrary compact set $K$, I just assume that $K$ is a closed disc $\bar{D}(0;R)$ to simplify the problem. So $\Omega=D(0;R)$ (Actually, even if I could solve the problem in this simple case, I don't know how to solve the problem in the general case. I just make the problem simpler and see where this specific case will lead me to) Clearly, $f$ has no zeros on $\partial\bar{D}$. Let $N$ denote the number of zeros of $f$ in $D(0;R)$ and $\gamma$ be the circle with center at $0$ and radius $R$. If I could prove that $$N=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz$$ (which is different from the classical Argument Principle I learnt), I could solve the simpler case. Since $f$ is holomorphic in $D(0;R)$ and not identically zero in $D(0;R)$, the number of zeros of $f$ in $D(0;R)$ is finite. Let $r=sup\lbrace|a|:f(a)=0, a\in D(0;R)\rbrace$. Therefore, all the zeros of $f$ lie in the open disc $D(0;r)$. Pick $\rho$ such that$\rho$ such that $R>\rho>r$. Define $\gamma_\rho(\theta)=\rho e^{i\theta}$ on $[0,2\pi]$ Now, the classical Argument Principle can be used. Therefore, $$N(\rho)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma_\rho}\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz$$ or $$N(\rho)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{f'(\rho e^{i\theta})}{f(\rho e^{i\theta})}\rho e^{i\theta}d\theta$$ Now, let $\rho\to R$. Therefore, $\lim_{\rho\to R}N(\rho)=N$. However, I cannot prove that $f'$ is continuous on $\bar{D}(0;R)$, though $f'$ is really continuous in $D(0;R)$. Thus, I failed to solve the problem.

\end{align*}$$ for $k = 1,\dots,16$ where w is any complex 17th root of unity. Note the specific arrangement of the $y_n$. There are $16! \approx 2 \times 10^{13}$ possible permutations of the $y_n$, and out of that huge number, there are only 16 such that $R_{16}$ has integer coefficients, and we have given one of them. Of course, a short cut was used to find it, because even if your computer can check a million permutations a second, it would still take about 8 months to go through them all. The short cut took less than two hours to find $R_{16}$. The $y_n$ follows the root object Root[poly, n] ordering in Mathematica.  Approximately, these are, $$\begin{align*}
y_1 &= 149.7726\\
\{y_2, y_3\} &= -27.62 \mp 18.49i\\
\{y_4, y_5\} &= -21.61 \mp 7.52i\\
\{y_6, y_7\} &= -16.58 \mp 6.34i\\
\{y_8, y_9\} &= -10.57 \mp 15.32i\\
\{y_{10}, y_{11}\} &= -5.02 \mp 13.71i\\
\{y_{12}, y_{13}\} &= -2.34 \mp 13.15i\\
\{y_{14}, y_{15}\} &= 2.57 \mp 2.60i\\
\{y_{16}, y_{17}\} &= 6.31 \mp 7.04i
\end{align*}$$ $R_{16}$ has extremely large integer coefficients, with the largest being the 248-digit constant term $429534618434587^{17}$ which, naturally enough, is a 17th power.  (Note:  $R_{16}$ can easily be formed using 500-digit precision or more on the $y_n$, and multiplying the 16 factors together to form the polynomial.) The polynomial $R_{16}$ can then be factored into two octics over the radical extension $\sqrt{17}$. This, in turn, can be factored into 2 quartics over $\sqrt{2(17+\sqrt{17})}$. This can be factored further into 2 quadratics using an expression involved in the 17th root of unity. Apparently, to solve $R_{16} = 0$, only square roots of square roots of square roots, etc, are needed. The real root of eq.2 in radicals is then, $$y_1 = {z_1}^{1/17} + {z_2}^{1/17} + {z_3}^{1/17} + \dots + {z_{16}}^{1/17} = 149.7726 \dots$$ Problem : Express the roots of this particular $R_{16}$ purely in terms of the complex 17th root of unity.  (If anyone knows how to contact the mathematician Peter-Lawrence Montgomery, he probably will know how, since he has done something similar with a septic root and the 29th root of unity.)","['galois-theory', 'polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'number-theory']"

65407,"""Proof"" that $\mathbb{R}^J$ is not normal when $J$ is uncountable","In 'Topology' by Munkres, he leaves as an exercise to prove that $\mathbb{R}^J$ is not normal under the product topology when $J$ is uncountable.  The proof outlined as exercise 32.9 is the same one given in the 'Counterexamples in Topology' book, space #103 , Uncountable Products of $\mathbb{Z}^+$.  My question is a two-fer: 1)  Is what I've outlined below an alternative proof to parts (c) and (d) in his problem as stated?  Or have I gone wrong at some step?  I am skeptical, as my ""proof"" is quite a bit simpler than what is given in the outline in the book, and it is mentioned a few times that the proof is quite difficult.  Perhaps I am missing the point, which is to see what Stone did in his proof with his particular sequences and sets.  Which leads me to my second question... 2)  When simpler proofs do exist, is it tradition in mathematics to honor the original proofs as a matter of principle, publishing them instead of more streamlined versions? Proof that $\mathbb{R}^J$ is not normal: The proof begins by examining a closed subspace of $\mathbb{R}^J$, in this case $X = (\mathbb{Z}_+)^J$, and showing that it is not normal.  The elements in $X$ are written using the map notation, $x:J \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_+$. First, in part (a), it's shown that if $x \in X$ and $B$ is a finite subset of $J$, then the sets $U(x, B) = \{ y \in X : y(\alpha) = x(\alpha), \alpha \in B\}$ form a basis for $X$. Second, in part (b), it's shown that if $P_n$ is the subset of $X$ consisting of $x \in X$ s.t. $x$ is injective on $J - x^{-1}(n)$, that $P_n$ is closed.  Moreover, if $n \neq m$, then $P_n \cap P_m = \emptyset$.  The proof of this utilizes the basis elements in (a). Here's where my proof differs from that of the literature.  Consider a set $P_n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, and suppose that $U$ is an open set containing $P_n$.  We will show that $U = X$, and so $X$ cannot be normal, since two closed sets $P_n$ and $P_m$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets. Choose some $\alpha' \in J$, and define a set of sequences $x_i \in X$ as follows, where $i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$:  Let $x_i(\alpha) = i$ when $\alpha = \alpha'$, and $x_i(\alpha) = n$ otherwise.  Then each sequence $x_i \in P_n$, since $x_i(\alpha) = n$ on all but at most a singleton in $J$, namely $\alpha'$.  Thus, $x_i \in U$ for each $i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.  As such, the coordinate corresponding to $\alpha'$ in the product of open sets that make up $U$ must be equal to $\mathbb{Z}^+$.  Since $\alpha'$ was arbitrary, every coordinate in the product $U$ must be equal to $\mathbb{Z}^+$, and so $U = X$. Thus $X$ cannot be normal, as two disjoint closed sets, $P_n$ and $P_m$ where $n \neq m$, cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.","['general-topology', 'alternative-proof']"

65575,A Van der Corput style inequality for highly oscillatory integrals,"Suppose $f$ has at least two continuous derivatives, $f'$ is monotonically increasing, and $f' \geq \lambda$ for some $\lambda > 0$. How might one find the upper bound $|\int_a^b \cos(f(x))| \leq 2/\lambda$? I've tried a number of basic approaches and none have worked. For instance, I've tried rewriting $\cos(f(x))$ as $(\sin(f(x)))' / f'(x)$, which seemed promising until I realized that I cannot justify the inequality $|\int_a^b (\sin(f(x)))' / f'(x)| \leq (1/\lambda) |\int_a^b (\sin(f(x)))'|$. Of course, were that true, then the result would follow quickly by evaluating the new integral, applying the triangle inequality, and finally noting that $|\sin(x)| \leq 1$. I've tried a similar approach using the mean value theorem for integrals but was only able to show that there is some $\theta$, $a < \theta < b$, so that $|\int_a^b \cos(f(x))| \leq \frac{1}{\lambda} (|f(\theta) - f(a)| + |f(b) - f(\theta)|)$, which is not strong enough either.","['harmonic-analysis', 'analysis']"
65576,"Trouble counting the number of ""ace high"" hands in poker","I'm trying to count the number of ""ace high"" hands in a five card poker hand.  The solution from my answer key puts the count at 502,860; however, I have an argument for why this number is too high.  Please help me understand where my logic is flawed. Instead of coming up with an exact answer for the number of ace high hands I will show an upper bound on the number of ace high hands.  First, go through the card deck and remove all four aces leaving a deck of 48 cards.  We will use this 48 card deck to form the four card ""non ace"" part of the ""ace high"" hand.  First, how many ways are there to form any four card hand from a 48 card deck?  This is (48 choose 4) = 194,580.  Now, not all of these hands when paired with an ace will form an ""ace high"" hand. For example A Q Q K K would be two pair.  In fact, any four card hand with at least two cards of the same rank (e.g. Queen of Spades, Queen of Hearts) will not generate an ace high hand.  So let's find the number of such hands and subtract them from 194,580. I believe the number of such hands can be found by first selecting a rank for a pair from these 48 remaining cards, that is, (12 choose 1)--times the number of ways to select two suits for our rank (4 choose 2)--times the number of ways to pick the remaining 2 required cards from 46 remaining cards, that is, (46 choose 2).  So, restated, given our 48 card deck we can create a four card hand that contains at least one pair this many ways: (12 choose 1)(4 choose 2)    (46 choose 2) = 74,520 [pair rank]  [suits of pair] [remaining 2 cards] Thus the number of four card hands that do not include at least one pair is: (48 choose 4) - 74,520 = 120,060 We can pair each of these four card sets with one of our four aces to form the number of five card hands that contain an ace, but not any single pair (or better).  This is 120,060 * 4 = 480,240 hands.  However, this is already less than 502,860 shown by the key... and I haven't even begun to start subtracting out straights.  Clearly I have made a mistake, but what is it?",['combinatorics']

65686,Total Derivative and Multilinear Functions,"So I'm starting to work through Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds and I'm having a little trouble verifying some of the claims made in the book problems. To review: Given a function $\mathbf{f}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}^m$ , we say that $\mathbf{f}$ is differentiable at a point $\mathbf{a}=(a^{1},\ldots,a^{n})\in\mathbb{R}^n$ (considered as a $1\times n$ matrix) if there exists a linear transformation, $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a}):\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ , (considered as an $m\times n$ matrix) such that $$\lim\limits_{\mathbf{h}\to\mathbf{a}}\dfrac{\|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{h})-\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a})-D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a})(\mathbf{h})\|}{\|\mathbf{h}\|}=0.$$ $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a})$ is called the total derivative or Jacobian matrix of $\mathbf{f}$ at $\mathbf{a}$ and is unique. We are then asked to prove that if $\mathbf{f}:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^p$ is bilinear, then $$\lim\limits_{(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{k})\to\mathbf{0}}\dfrac{\|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{k})\|}{\|(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{k})\|}=0.$$ The best approach I could think of was that $\|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{k})\|=\|\mathbf{h}\|\cdot\|\mathbf{k}\|\cdot\|\mathbf{f}(\hat{\mathbf{h}},\hat{\mathbf{k}})\|$ , where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}=\frac{\mathbf{x}}{\|\mathbf{x}\|}$ . We then have that $\|\mathbf{h}\|\cdot\|\mathbf{k}\|\leq\|\mathbf{h}\|^{2}+\|\mathbf{k}\|^{2}=\|(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{k})\|^{2}$ , which gives us $$\dfrac{\|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{k})\|}{\|(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{k})\|}\leq\|(\mathbf{h},\mathbf{k})\|\cdot\|\mathbf{f}(\hat{\mathbf{h}},\hat{\mathbf{k}})\|,$$ where $\|\hat{\mathbf{h}}\|=\|\hat{\mathbf{k}}\|=1$ . And since $\|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\|\leq\|\mathbf{f}(\hat{\mathbf{x}},\mathbf{y})\|\cdot\|\mathbf{x}\|$ (similarly for $\mathbf{y}$ ) then $f$ is a bounded ( continuous ) linear transformation and $$\|\mathbf{f}\|_{x}=\sup\{\|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\|:\|\mathbf{x}\|=1\}<\infty$$ $$\|\mathbf{f}\|_{y}=\sup\{\|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\|:\|\mathbf{y}\|=1\}<\infty,$$ which I was hoping would imply that $\|\mathbf{f}(\hat{\mathbf{h}},\hat{\mathbf{k}})\|<\infty$ , and so we'd have the result we're looking for. But I am stuck here. Assuming this result, I was able to complete the problem and prove that $$D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y})+\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b}).$$ The author then proceeds to ask us to prove the following: Given a multilinear function $\mathbf{f}:\mathbb{R}^{n_1}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{R}^{n_k}\to\mathbb{R}^p$ , show that for $\mathbf{h}=(\mathbf{h}_1,\dots,\mathbf{h}_k)$ , with $\mathbf{h}_i\in\mathbb{R}^{n_i}$ , we have $$\lim\limits_{\mathbf{h}\to\mathbf{0}}\dfrac{\|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{a}_{i-1},\mathbf{h}_i,\mathbf{a}_{i+1}\ldots,\mathbf{a_{j-1}},\mathbf{h}_j,\mathbf{a}_{j+1},\ldots,\mathbf{a}_k)\|}{\|\mathbf{h}\|}=0,$$ for $i\neq j$ . Use this to prove that $$D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{a}_k)(\mathbf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_k)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}{\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{a}_{i-1},\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{a}_{i+1}\ldots,\mathbf{a}_k)}.$$ Using the hint from the book of considering the bilinear function, $\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{x},\ldots,\mathbf{y},\ldots,\mathbf{a}_k)$ , I was able to show the first part of the problem assuming the above result (which I still can't prove). However I'm now also stuck on how to prove the rest of the question. For example, consider the specific case with three arguments. Using the fact that $\mathbf{f}$ is multilinear, we have $$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{h_1},\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{h_2},\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{h_3})-\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})=$$ $$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{h_3})+\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{h_2},\mathbf{c})+\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{h_1},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}) +$$ $$+\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{h_2},\mathbf{h_3})+\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{h_1},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{h_3})+\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{h_1},\mathbf{h_2},\mathbf{c})+$$ $$+\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{h_1},\mathbf{h_2},\mathbf{h_3}).$$ The first three terms are what should be $D\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})$ while the next three will disappear in the limit given the first part of the proof. The trouble is how do I control the limit $\lim\limits_{\mathbf{h}\to\mathbf{0}}\frac{\|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{h_1},\mathbf{h_2},\mathbf{h_3})\|}{\|(\mathbf{h_1},\mathbf{h_2},\mathbf{h_3})\|}$ ? This trouble arises in the general case as well, any time the number of $\mathbf{h_i}$ is more than two in any single term. E.g. how would I control the term $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{a_1},\mathbf{a_2},\mathbf{h_3},\mathbf{h_4})$ , which has two "" $h$ "" and "" $a$ "" terms each? Thanks for any help.

Let $M'$ be the oriented circle bundle over $S$.  Now to some (or all) of the torus boundary components of $M'$, we can ""sew"" a solid torus $N$ as follows. First, call the boundary component in $M'$ we're focusing on $T$.  Let $D$ be a meridional disk in $N$ with boundary $\delta D$, and attach $\delta D$ to a simple closed curve in $T$ of slope $\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$ (here slope means when I lift this simple closed curve to the universal cover $\mathbb{R}^2$, the line has slope $\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$).  I fill in the rest (a 3-ball) in an essentially unique way.  After I've done all the attaching I want, I get a Seifert-fibred space $M$. My question is: how can I get a presentation for $\pi_1(M)$ from the knowledge of $S$ and the slopes?  For example, if $S$ is a disk, then $M'$ is just a solid torus.  Attaching another solid torus with slope $\frac{p}{q}$ gives the lens space $L_\frac{p}{q}$. If $t$ represents a longitudinal circle in $M'$, then $\pi_1(M')=\langle t\rangle$ and for $M$ we simply add the relation $t^q=1$. But things can't be that easy! Because if $S$ is an annulus, then $M'$ is just $S\times S^1$; now suppose we want to fill in the two boundary components of $M'$ with two solid tori $N_1$ and $N_2$, using slopes $\frac{a}{b}$ and $\frac{e}{f}$. If $t$ represents a longitudinal circle in $M'$ and $d$ a meridional circle, then $\pi_1(M') = \langle t,d\ |\ [t,d]=1\rangle$. I want to believe that I then get $\pi_1(M)=\langle t,d\ |\ [t,d]=1, d^a=t^b, d^e=t^f\rangle$, but this is not true.

65727,Some basic book to start with modules?,"I am very interested in studying modules, which I have studied algebra, is basic theory of groups and rings, of Hungerford and Dummit. I was reading the Dummit the module, but I still struggled a bit in the section and the tensor product of exact sequences, as in the book of Atiyah. They know a simple book to begin with?","['modules', 'book-recommendation', 'reference-request', 'abstract-algebra']"
65731,What is the cardinality of the set of all topologies on $\mathbb{R}$?,This was asked on Quora. I thought about it a little bit but didn't make much progress beyond some obvious upper and lower bounds. The answer probably depends on AC and perhaps also GCH or other axioms. A quick search also failed to provide answers.,"['general-topology', 'descriptive-set-theory']"
65744,Product of $ |z^k - 1| $,"Problem: Prove the following identity about the product involving the nth roots of unity: $$
\prod_{k=1}^{N-1}|z^k-1| = N
$$ where $ z^k $ is the primitive nth root of unity. Attempt: $$
\begin{align}
\prod_{k=1}^{N-1}|z^k-1| &= \prod_{k=1}^{N-1}\left|(\cos(\frac{2\pi k}{N})-1)+i\sin(\frac{2\pi k}{N})\right| \\
&=\prod_{k=1}^{N-1}\sqrt{\cos^2(\frac{2\pi k}{N})-2\cos(\frac{2\pi k}{N})+1+\sin^2(\frac{2\pi k}{N})} \\
&=\prod_{k=1}^{N-1}\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{2\pi k}{N})} \\
&=\prod_{k=1}^{N-1}2\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\cos(\frac{2\pi k}{N}))} \\
&=2^{N-1}\prod_{k=1}^{N-1}\sin(\frac{k\pi}{N})
\end{align}
$$ I found on Wikipedia that there is an identity for the last product: $ \prod_{k=1}^{N-1}\sin(\frac{k\pi}{N}) = N/2^{N-1} $. However I do not know how to prove it. Could someone help me prove the last identity or perhaps suggest a different approach to the problem?","['trigonometry', 'complex-numbers']"

65758,Is there an analytical solution to this nonlinear ODE?,"Is there an analytical solution to the nonlinear ODE
$$\frac{dx}{d\theta} = -\sqrt{\frac{x^2}{4\cos^2\theta} - \cos^2\theta}$$
over $\theta \in [0, \pi/2]$ with initial condition $x(0) = 2$?
Using the substitution $y = \sin\theta$, I was able to transform this into
$$\frac{dx}{dy} = -\sqrt{\frac{x^2-4(1-y^2)^2}{4(1-y^2)^2}},$$
but couldn't get much further. Context: On a typical globe, one can only see half of the earth at a time. Waldo Tobler's slides on "" Unusual Map Projections "" mention the following amusing solution to this problem: simply wrap the earth around the globe twice (see image ). In trying to find an aesthetically pleasing conformal version of this construction by changing the shape of the globe, I found myself needing to solve the above ODE to determine its cross section; specifically, mapping latitude $\theta$ to distance from the polar axis, $x(\theta)$. It can be solved numerically, of course, and that's what I did. I'm just curious about whether an analytical solution exists. The numerical solution looks a lot like $x(\theta) = 2\sqrt{\cos\theta}$, but isn't exactly the same. In case you're curious, here is a render of the final result of my hacking on all this.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'recreational-mathematics']"
