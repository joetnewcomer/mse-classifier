700374,Set convergence and lim inf and lim sup,"I'm a bit confused with the general concept of convergence of a sequence of sets. I'm well aware that the limit of a sequence $\{C^{\nu}\}$ exists iff $$\liminf_{\nu \rightarrow \infty} C^{\nu} = \limsup_{\nu \rightarrow \infty} C^{\nu}$$ where lim inf (resp. lim sup) is the set of points that appear in the limit all but finitely many times (resp. infinitely many times ). However, intuitively, the limit point can appear only once, i.e., for $\nu \rightarrow \infty$. Isn't this in contrast with the concepts of lim inf and lim sup (defined as above)? For instance, let $C^{\nu} \triangleq [0,1-1/\nu]$: the sequence $\{C^{\nu}\}$ should (intuitively) converge to $C \rightarrow [0,1]$. However, I think the point $\{1\}$ is included in $C$ only for $\nu=\infty$ and, therefore, it appears only once.

700547,Game Theory/Bayesian approach to a bluffing game,"Two players play the following card game with a deck consisting of (A,2,3,4,5). A dollar is placed in the pot by some third party, and player 1 is dealt a card. If it is an A, he has a winning card, otherwise he has a losing card. Player 1 can decide whether to fold (conceding the dollar to player 2) or bet, by placing an additional dollar in the pot. If Player 1 bets, player 2 can decide to fold (conceding the pot to player 1) or call, by placing an additional dollar in the pot. If player 2 calls, player 1 reveals his card - if it is a A, he takes the pot, otherwise player 2 takes the pot. It's not hard to see that there's a Nash equilibrium where player 1 always bets if he has an ace, and bluffs 12.5% of the time if he doesn't. Player 2 calls 50% of player 1's bets. The long-run expectation is \$0.30/round for player 1, and \$0.70/round for player 2. However, in reality it is unlikely that both players will play the Nash equilibrium strategy (they may not be rational, they may not believe that the other player is rational, they may just be playing for fun, etc etc). From player 1's perspective, if player 2 calls a fraction $p$ of the time, then player 1 should always bluff if $p<0.5$ and never bluff if $p>0.5$, in order to maximize his own expectation. That is, the optimal bluffing frequency is $$B(p) = \begin{cases} 1 && p < 0.5 \\ 0 && p > 0.5\end{cases}$$ Now, player 1 might have a probability distribution $f(p)$ on player 2's calling frequency. In that case, it seems to make sense that the bluffing frequency for player 1 would be the probability-weighted average of the optimal action for each specific $p$ - $$p_{\rm Bluff} = \int_0^1 {B}(p) f(p) dp = \int_0^{0.5} f(p) dp \tag{1}$$ But that leads to the conclusion that if player 1 has an uninformative prior $f(p)=1$, he should bluff with frequency $p_{\rm Bluff} = 0.5$. That contrasts with my intuition that if you have no information about player 2's strategy, you should play the Nash equilibrium strategy. I'm concerned that equation (1) doesn't make any mention of the Nash equilibrium strategy at all - it seems that it should play a role, which makes me think that (1) cannot be correct. Which is it? Does game theory have anything to say about the situation where one player might not play optimally, but you don't know exactly how he plays? Is there a way of deriving the ""correct"" play if you have a probability distribution for your opponent's strategy?","['game-theory', 'probability', 'gambling']"

700641,"Is there a ""geometric"" interpretation of inert primes?","I am currently learning about étale morphisms and how they behave a lot like covering maps. Now if I'm in the example of the ring of integers of a number field, it is possible to think of it as a curve and if I take the ring of integers of a finite extension, this behaves similar as a ramified covering in Riemann surfaces theory. However, in the complex case, I think there is no analogue of the inertia phenomenon. I am trying to see wether this can still be given some kind of geometric meaning. My current vague interpretation is that of it being some kind of ""weighting"" the points in the preimage of a given prime, as such it makes it possible for example to carry over the ""degree formula"" from topology (the degree of a map being the sum of local degrees), as over an unramified prime this is just the sum of the inertia degrees. I'm not really satisfied by this though, and want to know wether there are other or more precise Interpretations out there.

700880,What is the probability of product of two elements is desired element?,"Let $G$ be a group with $n$ element. Fix $x\in G$. If you choose randomly two elements from $G$, what is the probability of $x$ being product of these two elements? At first, I thought answer was $1/n$, because, if $ab=x$ and if I choose $a$, it uniquely determines $b$. I guess it is true answer when $G$ is abelian. But when $G$ is nonabeliean, $ab$ and $ba$ may be different elements; therefore, the probability is higher than $1/n$. I can't say the answer is $2/n$ since some pairs may still commute in nonabelian group. I also noticed that the probability also depends on $x$, because, if $x=e$, you must choose $a,a^{-1}$ as a pair, so answer is $1/n$ regardless of $G$ is abelian or not. If we denote this probability as $P_x(G)$, I think $1/n\leq P_x(G)\leq 2/n$. Any further result will be appreciated.

$$(g*\mu)(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}g(x-y)\mu(dy).$$

$$\|g*\mu\|_{L^p}\leq A_\mu \|g\|_{L^p}, \text{ where $A$ is a quantity dependent on $\mu$ which stays bounded.} $$ Remarks: (1) Note that if $\mu$ is an absolutely continuous measure w.r.t. the lebesgue measure i.e. $\mu<<\mathcal{L}_{{R}^n}$ then the Young's inequality holds. (2) If $\mu$ is a dirac measure (in the sense of Lebesgue decomposition theorem) say $\mu=\delta_0$, a similar estimate follows as well
$$ \|g*\delta_0\|_{L^p}^p=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}dx\left|\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}g(x-y)d\delta_0(dy)\right|=\|g\|_{L^p}.$$ By Lebesgue's decomposition theorem $\mu$ can be written as a sum of absolutely continuous part, discrete (delta) part and a cantor part. I do not know how to handle the Cantor part.

All students start with 1200 points, there is a minimum of 1000 points. It's easy to rank students individually: for example the most attractive person within school ""x"" is simply the one with the highest elo points. Problem: I want to have a ranking for a group of students- in other words i want to say ""here are the most attractive schools"" My idea (which I think is bad): Take an average of the elo points for all students. My thought is that since ""every win also means there is a loss"" the distribution curve for all schools should be relatively similar- so the average elo points for every school will be relatively similar. A wider distribution curve would simply mean there are greater numbers of both more attractive and less attractive students (I think?). So does anyone have a (somewhat statistically significant) method of saying ""this group of students is more attractive than that group of students?""

Suppose that N points $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{N}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ are given (and they are so that $O = (0, 0, 0)$ is the interior point of $Hull(O, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{N})$). Let's consider the set $\mathfrak{M}$ of all closed convex surfaces $M$ that have the following property: $O = \{0, 0, 0\} \in Int \overline{M}$, where $\overline{M}$ is a convex body whose bondary is $M$, i. e. $\partial \overline{M} = M$ It's needed to find such $M \in \mathfrak{M}$ that minimizes the sum of distances from $x_{i}$ to $M$ for all $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{N}$. $$

Does anybody know any method to find such best surface or polyhedron? NOTE: It is not a convex hull.

If I am not mistaken (please let me know if I am), the solution can be explicitly written down in terms of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfuctions $\{\phi_k\}_{k\geq 1}$, which form a basis of $L^2(\mathcal{S})$, and the corresponding eigenvalues $\lambda_k$: $$u(t,x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \cos(\sqrt{\lambda_k}t) \phi_k(y) \phi_k(x)$$ Now, what surprises me, is that ""mass"" is not conserved in the sense that $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{\mathcal{S}} u(x,t) dx = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} -\sqrt{\lambda_k}\sin(\sqrt{\lambda_k}t) \phi_k(y) \int_{\mathcal{S}}\phi_k(x) dx$$ So ""mass"" changes over time depending on the $\lambda_k$ and thus on the geometry of the surface.

701850,How to appropriately normalize financial data?,"I am evaluating a normalization of financial data. Two colleagues feel certain of a certain approach, and I am befuddled. The approach shapes the results how they want (i.e., brings possibly extreme results toward a notional center line) but I'm not convinced it is mathematically cogent. For background, we are analyzing the performance of loans we provide. We define $purchase\ price$ as the money we lend, $purchase\ amount$ is the total we expect to be paid back, $revenue$ to be the difference of $purchase\ price$ and $purchase\ amount$, and $margin$ to be $revenue - commissions$. For the sake of simplification, let us assume that there are no commissions, such that $revenue \equiv margin$. We say that the $default\ rate$ as a percentage of margin is as follows, with $defaults$ being $anticipated\ margin - actual\ margin$: $$default\ rate = 1 - \frac{actual\ margin}{anticipated\ margin} = \frac{defaults}{anticipated\ margin}$$ During the underwriting and quoting phase, we collect all the expected information and generate a couple of risk scores, and then a human makes qualitative judgements of the risk of the customer and of the loan. This risk is captured by the margin we charge and the time length of the repayment schedule. Riskier loans will skew higher in margin or (not XOR) shorter term length, less risky loans lower in margin or longer in term length. We want to evaluate the performance of various classes of historical loans to decide if we properly priced against the resultant behavior of that business. That is, we want to decide if we adequately priced for risk. We do this by calculating the default rate for one class of business (e.g., from a particular industry or from certain partner sales offices) and comparing it to some benchmark default rate. We want to normalize the default rates to equivalent units. It may be that one segment of the business hit a 30% default rate and another 20%, but unless we can reflect our anticipated risk on these segments and adjust the rates for comparability, we're concerned our analysis will be flawed. This is where my colleagues' notion arrives. They feel it appropriate to ""normalize"" by calculating margin per month as $$margin\ per\ month = \frac{margin}{term\ length}$$ and taking the mean across all the business as average margin per month $$average\ margin\ per\ month = \frac{\sum{margins}}{\sum{term\ lengths}}$$ to be a benchmark. With this, they will calculate a (purportedly) normalized default rate as $$normalized\ default\ rate = default\ rate \times \frac{average\ margin\ per\ month}{margin\ per\ month}$$ They seemed so sure that this gave them the ""normalization"" they wanted that I assumed my befuddlement was due to my being slow. I algebraically expanded their target formula and arrived at something that didn't make much sense: $$\frac{defaults}{margin^2} \times \frac{(\sum{margins}) \times term}{\sum{term\ lengths}}$$ There a couple of ways to rewrite that but they seem equivalently unuseful. My fundamental point of contention is not with the effort of normalization, but the method. Here, we pit the default rate for a class of business against the mean margin/month across all business divided by the margin/month for that class of business. They are right that this corrals the values some, e.g., a lower-than-average risk loan will have lower-than-average anticipated margin, and so its default rate in this analysis will actually be increased . Similarly, the actual default rate for high-risk loans will be decreased . If we expect a class of customer to be inherently riskier, we will price with a proportionately higher margin/month than a class of customer with ""average"" risk, so achieving a higher-than-average actual default rate for that class of customer doesn't itself worry us. Only if the actual default rate is higher than the target for that class of business/customer will we be worried. Does this make sense as a means of comparability, and if so, what am I missing? EDIT I could see if the various categories are distributed approximately normally and calculate a z score, but even then I'd like to determine if I'm missing something with this particular approach.","['statistics', 'data-analysis']"

701923,A formula for bit strings with no $k$ consecutive $1$'s using generating functions,"The following problem is taken from the book generatingfunctionology (P.28) by Herbert S. Wilf. Let $f(n,m,k)$ be the number of strings of $n$ $\,0$'s and $1$'s that contain exactly     $m\,$ $1$'s, no $k$ of which are consecutive. (a) Find a recurrence formula for $f$. It should have $f(n,m,k)$ on the left side, and exactly three terms on the right. (b) Find, in simple closed form, the generating functions
$$
F_k(x,y)=\sum_{n,m\ge0}f(n,m,k)x^ny^m \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\ (k=1,2,...).
$$
(c) Find an explicit formula for $f(n,m,k)$ from the genrating function (this should involve only a single summation, of an expression that involves a few factorials). I was able to solve (a) and (b) and found that the generating functions is
$$
F_k = \frac{1-x^ky^k}{1-x-xy-x^{k+1}y^k}
$$
However, I cannot seem to be able to extract the sequence from this function. Any help will be appreciated. Edit: I've added the way I solved (a) and (b) to allow any criticism in case I got the function wrong.
My solution to (a) goes as follows: Given $m,n,k$ such that $0\le k\le m \le n$ and $k\lt n$, we look at all of the bit string of length $n$ that contain exactly $m$ $1$'s, no $k$ of which are consecutive. We split these strings into two sets. The first composed of all the strings that end with $0$. This set has  $f(n-1,m, k)$ strings since by removing the $0$ from the end of the string we obtain a  one to one correspondence between the strings in our set and the strings $f(n-1,m, k)$ counts. The other set is composed of all the strings that end with $1$. By removing the last bit we obtain a one to one correspondence between our set and all strings counted by $f(n-1,m-1, k)$, except those that have $k-1$ consecutive $1$'s at the end. To count the latter we first note that since $k\lt n$ there must be another bit, which  must be $0$, before the last $k-1$ $\,1$'s. By removing the last $k$ bits ($10\cdots0$) we obtain a one to one correspondence with the strings that are counted by $f(n-k-1,\,m-k,\,k)$. With that we obtain the recursion: $$f(n,m,k) = f(n-1,m,k) + f(n-1,m-1,k) - f(n-k-1,\,m-k,\,k)$$ 
In addition, we note the if $0\le m \le n$ and $k > m$, then $f(n,m,k) = \binom{n}m$
, since we can't have more consecutive $1$'s than there are $1$'s, so the problem is reduced to counting the number of strings with length $n$ that have $m$ $1$'s. For all other cases we write $f(n,m,k) = 0$ which completes the definition. To Solve (b) I did the following: $$
\begin{align}
F_k(x,y) & = \sum_{n,m\ge0}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\
& = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\
& = \sum_{n=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=0}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\

\end{align}
$$
By using the convention that $\binom{n}m = 0$ when $m\gt n$, and noting that when $m=n\ge k$ we have $f(n,m,k)=0$ we can write the above equation as follows:
$$
\begin{align}
& \sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{n}m x^n y^m + \sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m \\

=& \frac{1}{1-x} \cdot \omega(x,y) + \sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m 
\end{align}
$$
where: $$\omega(x,y) := \frac{1 - (\frac{xy}{1-x})^k}{1 - \frac{xy}{1-x}}.$$
Using the recusion formula obtained in (a) we can expand the second summand like so:
$$
\begin{align}
\sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=k}^{n-1}f(n,m,k) x^n y^m & = A + B - C

702032,Evaluating Dirichlet series,"It is well known that
$$\eta(s)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^s} =(1-2^{1-s})\zeta(s)$$
But I have the wider problem of evaluating the following
$$f(s)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta^{k}}{k^s}$$
where $\zeta$ is a root of unity. So for instance, I would like to know if there is even a closed form solution for
$$f(s)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{i^{k}}{k^s}$$ I am interested in these results because I am trying to find the Zeta regularized sum of a particular series which is in a similar form to the ones stated above. Here is the problem in case you are curious. Evaluate $$\lim\limits_{s\to 0} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta^{k}}{k^s}(\sum\limits_{d|k}\frac{(-1)^{d-1}}{d})$$ Any suggestions would be helpful","['dirichlet-series', 'zeta-functions', 'limits']"

702066,Separability in Metric Spaces,"Let $(X,d)$ be a non-separable metric space. 
My question is the following: does there exist some $\epsilon > 0$ and some uncountable
subset $S$ of $X$ such that $d(x,y) > \epsilon $ for any $x, y \in S$? The question has a positive answer if $X$ is a normed linear space, as it can be easily proved by using the fact that if $M$ is a linear subspace and $x_{0}$ is not in the closure of X, then for some $\delta > 0$, $\|x - x_{0}\| > 0$ for every x in $M$  (so that $\|x - \lambda x_0\| > \lambda \delta$ for every $\lambda > 0$ and every $x \in M$), and applying Hausdorff maximality principle. I think the question has a negative in general, but I cannot find a counterexample.
Thank you very much in advance for your help.","['elementary-set-theory', 'metric-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
702075,Markov Chain: prove that state is positive recurrent by calculating expected # of transitions to return to this state,"Given the transitional probabilities below (states: 0,1,2,3), I need to prove that state 3 is positive recurrent by calculating expected # of transitions to return to this state $$P =
\pmatrix{0.65& 0.35 &0 &0\\
0.5& 0.1& 0.4 &0 \\
0.1 &0 &0 &0.9\\
0.6 &0 &0 &0.4\\}$$ now I see the all states communicate and the matrix is finite, then the MC is irreducible
and there is only one class. it also follows that the states are positive recurrent. however, I need to make the claim about the positive recurrence of state 3 through calculating expected # of transitions to return to this state if starting from state 3. How would I calculate this? I know there are some formulas for special Markov Chains, but I can't seem to understand the correct approach here. I cannot calculate it as E[..] by conditioning since it becomes infinite recurrence..","['stochastic-processes', 'probability']"

702097,Max Word Size as a Function of Number of Words,"I want to describe the relationship between largest word length, l , and the number of words in a set, n . Example: For the set of words {""the"", ""large"", ""rock""} , the largest word length is l = 5 For {""ten"", ""two"", ""cat""} , the largest word length is l = 3 For {""a"", ""Mathematics""} , the largest word length is l = 11 Can l be approximated as a function of n ? How is l related to n ? If n were allowed to be very large, l would obviously be the length of the largest word in the English language. If n were limited to 1, l would obviously be the average size of all words. Intuition tells me that choosing more words gives me a statistically better chance of requiring a more buckets, but I can't explain why. I am not sure whether this question belongs on StackOverflow or Mathematics. This is not a homework problem. It came up in an answer I posted over on StackOverflow .","['statistics', 'computational-complexity']"
