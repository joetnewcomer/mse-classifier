1147050,"$\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{K}[x,y,z]/\langle x^2-yz \rangle$ is normal and singular","Let $X=\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{K}[x,y,z]/\langle x^2-yz\rangle$ an affine scheme. It is singular because only at the rational point $0$ corresponding to the ideal $\langle x,y,z\rangle$, the jacobian matrix has rank zero, so $\operatorname{dim} T_{X,0}=3$ and $\operatorname{dim} T_{X,x}=2$ in all the other points. I know that the dimension of $\mathbb{K}[x,y,z]/\langle x^2-yz\rangle$ is $2$, but I can't prove it. However, my question is: I want to prove that $X$ is normal. In order to do this, I have built a ring homomorphism
  $\phi: \mathbb{K}[x,y,z] \mapsto \mathbb{K}[Y,Z]$ sending $x \mapsto YZ$, $y \mapsto Y^2$ and $z \mapsto Z^2$. Then $\langle x^2-yz\rangle \subset \operatorname{Ker} \phi$. Is the homomorphism correct? How can I proof the reverse inclusion?","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
1147053,Forward Algorithm Hidden Markov Model matrix help [Discrete]!,"So this may seem like a bioinformatics question but it is the math part that is giving me trouble.  I'm using a Python package called YAHMM to model DNA sequences.  I created a model  with two states (state1 and state2) and two silent states (start and end) Transitions : state1= s1, state2= s2 s1 > s1= 0.4
s1 > s2= 0.4
s1 > end= 0.2

s2 > s2= 0.4
s2 > s1= 0.4
s2 > end= 0.2 State 1 Probabilities: A= 0.4
 T= 0.4
 C= 0.1
 G= 0.1 State 2 Probabilities: A = T = C = G = 0.25 My sequence X= TTA and the program gave me this matrix as a result from the forward algorithm computation using natural log probabilities: [[       -inf        -inf  0.                -inf]
 [-1.60943791 -2.07944154        -inf -2.73336801]

position 1
position 2
position 3 So I can get the first row correct, 
    M(i,j) where i= observation and j= state
    M(1,1)= ln([transition from start to state1][emission of T])= (ln(0.5*0.4)= -1.609
    M(1,2)= ln([transition from start to state1][emission of T])= (ln(0.5*0.25)= -2.079 HERE'S THE PART I CAN'T FIGURE OUT: In the forward algorithm each entry in the matrix is supposed to be the probability of all paths that could lead to that position in the matrix, i.e. that state for that position. So for M(2,1) it should be a T being emitted from state1 for position 2. There are two possible paths for this, path1= start > state 1 emits T > state 1 emits T = [ln(0.5*0.4) + ln(0.4*0.4)]
path2= start > state 2 emits T > state 1 emits T = [ln(0.5*0.25) + ln(0.4*0.4)] so my computational approach was to add these paths together (since its log space) [ln(0.5*0.4) + ln(0.4*0.4)] + [ln(0.5*0.25) + ln(0.4*0.4)] = -7.354 This is way off from -2.9565 so can somebody tell me where i'm going wrong?

1147224,Show $z=0$ is a simple pole or removable singularity if $r\int_{0}^{2\pi}|f(re^{i\theta})|d\theta \lt M$,"I am trying to show that if $f$ analytic in $0 \lt |z| \lt R$ and there exists $M \gt 0$ such that for every $0 \lt r \lt R$ we have: $$r\int_{0}^{2\pi}|f(re^{i\theta})|d\theta \lt M$$
then $z=0$ is either a simple pole or removable singularity. Since I need to show that $z=0$ is either a simple pole or removable singularity, I tried to prove that $\lim_{z\to0}zf(z) = c$ So I first tried to estimate $|f(z)|$ using Cauchy's integral formula for punctured disk, where $C_1 = r_1e^{i\theta}, C_2 = r_2e^{i\theta}, 0 \lt r_1 \lt r_2 \lt R$:
$$|f(z)| = |\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{C_2}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta - \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{C_1}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta | \le$$
$$\le \frac{1}{2\pi}|\int_{C_2}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta| + \frac{1}{2\pi} |\int_{C_1}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta | =$$
$$\frac{1}{2\pi}|\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{r_2ie^{i\theta}f(r_2e^{i\theta})}{r_2e^{i\theta}-z}d\theta| +  \frac{1}{2\pi}|\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{r_1ie^{i\theta}f(r_1e^{i\theta})}{r_1e^{i\theta}-z}d\theta| \le$$
$$\le \frac{r_2}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{|f(r_2e^{i\theta})|}{|r_2e^{i\theta}-z|}d\theta +  \frac{r_1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{|f(r_1e^{i\theta})|}{|r_1e^{i\theta}-z|}d\theta$$ if we choose $r_1 \lt r_2 \lt \frac{1}{2}|z|$ then $|\zeta| \le \frac{|z|}{2}$ and then $|\zeta -z| \ge ||\zeta|-|z|| \ge \frac{|z|}{2} \implies \frac{1}{|\zeta-z|} \le \frac{2}{|z|}$ therefore we have:
$$
|f(z)| \le \frac{r_2}{\pi|z|}\int_{0}^{2\pi}|f(r_2e^{i\theta})|d\theta +  \frac{r_1}{\pi|z|}\int_{0}^{2\pi}|f(r_1e^{i\theta})|d\theta \lt \frac{2M}{\pi |z|}
$$ so $|zf(z)| \lt \frac{2M}{\pi}$ and therefore the limit is finite and could be zero in which case $z=0$ is removable singularity or non-zero in which case it's a simple pole.

1147231,Applying Green's Theorem,"I'm studying for a grad-school preliminary exam, and came across this problem which I am unable to solve. Let $C$ be a closed curve in the plane $ax + by + cz = 0$ (where $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$ are not all zero $0$), enclosing a region with area $S$.  Evaluate 
$$ I:= \oint\limits_C \left| \begin{array}{ccc} 
dx & dy & dz \\
a  & b  & c  \\
x  & y  & z \end{array} \right|

I = \oint\limits_C (bz - cy)dx + (cx - az)dy + (ay - bx)dz. $$ If we call $\Omega$ the region bounded by $C$, an application of Green's Theorem (or Stokes Theorem, if you prefer) yields $$
I = 2\iint\limits_\Omega a dydz + bdzdx + c dxdy.
$$ From here, I'm not sure what to do; I suspect that it's a simple solution and that I've just forgotten my vector calculus.  Anyway, any help is appreciated. EDIT: Substitute in $z = \frac{1}{c}\left(-ax - by \right)$ and then applying Green's Theorem doesn't bring me any closer.  Making such a substitution yields $$ I = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{c} \iint_\Omega dxdy $$ If $c \neq 0$ as required to make such a substitution, it is not the case that $\iint dxdy = S$. SECOND EDIT:  I've solved the problem, making use of the following version of Stokes' theorem: $$ \iint_\Omega (\nabla \times \mathbf{F} ) \cdot \mathbf{n} dS = \oint_{\partial \Omega} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}. $$ The above can be written as \begin{align*} I &= \oint\limits_C (bz - cy,cx - az,ay - bx)\cdot d\mathbf{r} \\
&= \iint_\Omega (\nabla \times (bz - cy,cx - az,ay - bx)) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}(a,b,c)\right) dS  \\
&=\iint_\Omega (2a,2b,2c) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}(a,b,c)\right) dS  \\
&=  2 \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \iint_\Omega dS  \\

1147420,Moriarty's calculator: some bizarre and deceptive graphical anomalies,"Background: This is a problem I first came across a few years ago in a calculus textbook (a James Stewart one), where it addressed some of the pitfalls of using graphing calculators. The original context addressed issues with the TI-83 calculator, but seeing as that most people use the vaunted TI-89 nowadays, I thought I would consider some issues with that one. My first few considerations proved to be simple to handle (and I will outline them below), but there is one that I have no idea how to address properly. I think it is sufficiently bizarre so as to call the challenge problem Moriarty's Enigma. Necessary information: The TI-89 Guidebook gives information on how the calculator draws objects given the screen dimensions of the calculator. Screen dimensions for all TI graphing calculators may be found here . The relevant information from the guidebook may be found here (link provided so as not to make an already long post even longer). The main point is that the graphing window is $159$ pixels wide and we want to start with $x=0$ and $x=2\pi$ (the reason for this will become very clear in a moment). Since there are $158$ ""gaps"" between pixels, the distance between pixels is $\frac{2\pi-0}{158}$. Thus, the $x$-values that the calculator actually plots are $x=0+\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n$, where $n=0,1,2,\ldots,158$. Elementary, my dear TI-89: First consider the graph of $y=\sin(161x)$, which is graphed below in dot mode on the window $0\leq x\leq 2\pi, -1.5\leq y\leq 1.5$ (this will be the window used in all examples so that my results will be reproducible by other users if desired): Now consider when the functions $y=\pm\sin(3x)$ are graphed simultaneously in square mode: It certainly looks as if $\sin(161x)=\pm\sin(3x)$. This actually makes sense in terms of the pixel information noted earlier: for $y=\sin(161x)$, the actual points plotted by the calculator are $\left(\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n,\sin\left(161\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right)\right)$ for $n=0,1,2,\ldots,158$. But
\begin{align}
\sin\left(161\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right) &= \sin\left(158\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n+3\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right)\\[1em]
  &= \sin(2\pi n)\cos\left(3\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right)+\sin\left(3\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right)\cos(2\pi n)\quad\text{[$\sin(\alpha+\beta)$]}\\[1em]
  &= \pm\sin\left(3\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right),\qquad n=0,1,\ldots,158
\end{align}
Thus, the $y$-values, and hence the points, plotted for $y=\sin(161x)$ lie on either $y=\sin(3x)$ or $-\sin(3x)$, as confirmed by the previous graph. The same reasoning can be used to show that all of the $y$-values for $\sin(158x)$ are plotted as zero: At this point, I was feeling confident about my ability to understand and detect graphing anomalies for trigonometric functions due to periodicity and the like, but the next function has thus far thwarted my analysis completely. Moriarty's Enigma: Graph $\sin(77x)$ in line mode: I can deduce how $\pm\sin(2x)$ comes into the mix (similar to the $\sin(161x)$ example), but I cannot see how $\pm\cos(2x)$ fits in. The $y$-values for $\sin(161x)$ seem to be a mixture of $\pm\sin(2x),\pm\cos(2x)$, and an array of different trigonometric functions. Here is the graph when all five functions are plotted simultaneously ($\sin(77x)$ plotted in line mode while $\pm\sin(2x),\pm\cos(2x)$ in square mode): As if that were not weird enough, graph $\sin(77x)$ and $\pm\sin(81x)$ in line mode: Finally, graph $\sin(77x)$ and $\cos(77x)$ in line mode: What other functions might be hidden in $\sin(77x)$ when graphing on the window $0\leq x\leq 2\pi, -1.5\leq y\leq 1.5$ for the TI-89? Where do $\pm\cos(2x)$ come into play? What about $\sin\left(\frac{77x}{79}\right)$ [fills in the diamond-looking regions] or $-\sin\left(\frac{77x}{79}\right)$ [runs tangent to / crosses middle max], etc.","['trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus', 'graphing-functions', 'recreational-mathematics']"

Prove that $A \sim C$ What I have: We know there exists functions $f,g$ such that $f:A\to B$ and $g:B \to C$ where $f$ and $g$ are bijective. We thus require to show that there exists a function $h:A \to C$ where $h$ is bijective. Can anyone please give me some hints that might point me in the right direction? I do not want a complete answer, simply a nudge in the right direction. UPDATE: This is my (very rough) attempt at the proof. We know there exists functions $f,g$ such that $f:A\to B$ and $g:B \to C$ where $f$ and $g$ are bijective. We thus require to show that there exists a function $h:A \to C$ where $h$ is bijective. Assume that $h(x) = g \circ f = g(f(x))$ . We must now show that $h$ is bijective. $\underline{RTP:}$ If $f$ and $g$ are surjective, then $g \circ f$ is surjective. $\underline{Proof:}$ We are given that $f$ and $g$ are surjective (since they are bijective). Suppose $c \in C$ , then since $g$ is surjective, we know $\exists b \in B$ such that $g(b) = c$ . Similarly, since $f$ is surjective, $\exists a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$ . Thus \begin{align}g \circ f(a) &= g(f(a))  \\ &= g(b) \\ &= c\end{align} Hence we have shown that $h$ is surjective. We must now show that $h$ is injective. $\underline{RTP:}$ If $f$ snd $g$ are injective, then $g\circ f$ is also injective. $\underline{Proof:}$ We are given that $f$ and $g$ are injective (since they are bijective) and suppose $$g \circ f(x_1) = g \circ f(x_2)$$ We thus have that $$g(f(x_1))= g(f(x_2))$$ Since $g$ is injective, we know that this is true if and only if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ . Similarly, since $f$ is injective, it follows that $$x_1 = x_2$$ Thus $g \circ f$ is injective. We have thus proven that there exists a function $h(x)= g \circ f : A \to C$ that is bijective.

  field $k$ and $M_{\cdot}$ is finitely generated, then
  the saturation map
  $M_{n}\rightarrow\Gamma(\text{Proj}S_{\cdot},\widetilde{M(n)_{\cdot}})$
  is an isomorphism for large $n$. The hint in [Hartshorne] says we can follow the hint in the proof of Theorem 5.19. But here is what I have tried to do but I couldn't solve it. Will be glad if someone can give the answer. Discussion The only reason why I would need a large $n$ is because of Serre's theorem A, which says that there exists $n_{0}$ such that the quasicoherent sheaf $\widetilde{M(n)_{\cdot}}$ is finitely generated by its global sections. The module $M_{n}$ seen as a submodule of the finitely generated notherian module $M_{\cdot}$, is also finitely generated, so we let $M_{n}=(m_{1},...,m_{n})$. By Serre's theorem, $\widetilde{M(n)_{\cdot}}$ is finitely generated by sections, we let 
$$\{s_{1},...,s_{k}\}\subset \Gamma(\text{Proj}S_{\cdot},\widetilde{M(n)_{\cdot})}$$
be such a generating set. Now I have problems relating the two generating sets. The saturation map $$\varphi:M_{n}\rightarrow \Gamma(\text{Proj}S_{\cdot},\widetilde{M(n)_{\cdot}})$$ is given as follows: if $m_{n}\in M_{n}$, and suppose $\{X_{1},...,X_{t}\}$ generates $S_{\cdot}$ in degree $1$, on $D_{+}(X_{i})$ we have $$\varphi^{i}:m_{n}\mapsto \frac{m_{n}}{1}\in ((M_{\cdot})_{X_{i}})_{n}$$ where the last expression means the submodule of $(M_{\cdot})_{X_{i}}$ in degree $n$. Then they glue to give a single global section, which I call it $\varphi(m_{n})$. My goal is to show that they generate $\Gamma(\text{Proj}(S_{\cdot},\widetilde{M(n)_{\cdot}})$. This way I can show that the saturation map is surjective, but I can't continue further.","['modules', 'quasicoherent-sheaves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'projective-module']"

Let $\displaystyle x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$ $100$ digits long numbers where every digit is $1$ or $2$ . Find the number of non-negative solutions to the equation $\displaystyle x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=6\cdot{\frac{10^{100}-1}{9}}$ My try: First $\displaystyle 6\cdot{\frac{10^{100}-1}{9}}=6(10^0+10^1+...+10^{99})$ . We are told that $\forall i\in[1,4]: x_i \ \mathrm{is} \ 100 \ \mathrm{digits \ long}$ , thus we can write $$x_1=\sum_{i=0}^{99}y_i\cdot{10^i} \ ; \ x_2=\sum_{i=0}^{99}z_i\cdot{10^i} \ ; \ x_3=\sum_{i=0}^{99}w_i\cdot{10^i} \ ; \ x_4=\sum_{i=0}^{99}t_i\cdot{10^i}$$ So, $$\small (y_0+z_0+w_0+t_0)10^0+(y_1+z_1+w_1+t_1)10^1+...+(y_{99}+z_{99}+w_{99}+t_{99})10^{99}=6(10^0+...+10^{99})$$ Equating coefficients we get a system of $100$ equations: $$\begin{cases}y_0+z_0+w_0+t_0=6\\ \qquad\qquad\vdots \\y_{99}+z_{99}+w_{99}+t_{99}=6\end{cases}$$ Hence, we need to find the number of non-negative solutions of the equation $a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4=6$ where $\forall i\in[1,4]: \ 1 \le a_i \le 2$ .

I came across Getting the shortest paths for chess pieces on n*m board , which uses a BFS to find the answer. However, I don't really need to know the path and I was hoping to come up with a general equation. I also noticed this was similar to some questions asked about finding Lattice Paths, however in this case, the path may contain horizontal movement. I started with a small case, with the starting point of A4 and a target point of C4. It's quick to see there are only three shortest paths between the two points (A4-B5-C4, A4-B4-C4, and A4-B3-C4). Then I expanded, starting out at A4 and targeting D4 and came up with seven possible shortest paths (A4-B5-C5-D4, A4-B5-C4-D4, A4-B4-C5-D4, A4-B4-C4-D4, A4-B3-C3-D4, A4-B3-C4-D4, A4-B4-C3-D4). At this point it seemed like coming up with an equation wouldn't too terribly hard, but my math skills fail me here. Starting with the first case (A4-C4), from the starting location, A4, it seems there are three possible choices. Then from any of those spaces, there is only one possible choice, C4. For the second case (A4-D4), from the start there are again only three possible choices. Then from those three locations, two only have two choices (B3 & C5) and one has three choices (C4). Then, from all of those resulting locations, there is only once choice, D4. I feel like I'm close, but cannot solidify an equation.

1148198,Claim from an Actuarial Textbook: limits imply the existence of mean and variance,"This is from Actuarial Mathematics for Life Contingent Risks , 2nd ed., by Dickson et al. Some definitions (not directly from the book): Definitions/Notation . $T_x$ is defined to be the future lifetime of a life age $x \geq 0$ . We also define the cumulative distribution function of $T_x$ , denoted either $F_{T_x}$ or $F_x$ , as $$F_{T_x}(t) = F_{x}(t) = \mathbb{P}\{T_x \leq t\}\text{.}$$ The survival function of $T_x$ , denoted $S_x$ , is defined as $$S_{x}(t) = 1 - F_{x}(t)\text{.}$$ It should also make sense that $T_x$ takes on only nonnegative values; i.e., $T_x \geq 0$ . So, of course, $$\mathbb{E}\left[T_x\right] = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty}tf_{x}(t)\text{ d}t$$ where $f_{x}$ is the probability density function of $T_x$ . Throughout this textbook, it is assumed that $S_{x}$ is differentiable for all $t > 0$ . The text also makes the following assumptions: Assumption 2.2 : $\lim_{t \to \infty}tS_{x}(t) = 0$ Assumption 2.3 : $\lim_{t \to \infty}t^2S_{x}(t) = 0$ ""These last two assumptions ensure that the mean and variance of the distribution of $T_x$ exist."" Now here's the main question : why is this true ? I can no longer find where I asked this before, but I recall that the converse is actually true (i.e., what the authors are stating here is indeed false), but never was able to find justification for why . I also know for a fact that IF $\mathbb{E}[T_x]$ exists that $$\mathbb{E}[T_x] = \int_{0}^{\infty}S_{x}(t) \text{ d}t\text{,}$$ but this is of course, not helpful, since it assumes that $\mathbb{E}[T_x]$ exists to begin with.

Show that each solution of the differential equation goes to $\frac{l}{a}$ while $x \to +\infty$, i.e. if $\phi$ is any solution of the differential equation, show that $\lim_{x \to +\infty} \phi(x)=\frac{l}{a}$. That's what I have tried: The solution of the differential equation will be of the form: $\phi(x)=ce^{-ax}+e^{-ax} \int_0^x e^{at}b(t) dt$ $\lim_{x \to +\infty} c e^{-ax}=0$ So, $\lim_{x \to +\infty} \phi(x)=\lim_{x \to +\infty} e^{-ax} \int_0^x e^{at}b(t)dt$ How can we calculate the limit $\lim_{x \to +\infty} e^{-ax} \int_0^x e^{at}b(t)dt$ ? EDIT : 
$$\lim_{x \to +\infty} b(x)= l \in \mathbb{R}$$ That means that $\forall \epsilon>0$, $\exists n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n \geq n_0$: $|b(x)-l|< \epsilon \Rightarrow - \epsilon< b(x)-l< \epsilon \Rightarrow l- \epsilon<b(x)<l+ \epsilon$. We pick $\epsilon=\frac{l}{2}$ and so we have that: $b(x)>\frac{l}{2}$. Thus $\int_0^x e^{at} b(t)dt> \int_0^x e^{at} \frac{l}{2} dt=\frac{l}{2} \int_0^x e^{at}dt$ If $l>0$ then $\frac{l}{2} \int_0^x e^{at}dt \to +\infty$ and so $\int_0^x e^{at} b(t)dt$ diverges. If $l<0$ then $\frac{l}{2} \int_0^x e^{at}dt \to -\infty$ and so $\int_0^x e^{at} b(t)dt$ diverges. In both of the above cases, we can use the Fundamental Theorem Of Calculus: $$\lim_{x \to +\infty} e^{-ax} \int_0^x e^{at} b(t) dt= \lim_{x \to +\infty} \frac{\int_0^x e^{at} b(t) dt}{e^{ax}}=\lim_{x \to +\infty} \frac{e^{ax} b(x)}{a e^{ax}} \to \frac{l}{a}$$ What can we say for the case $l=0$?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'limits']"

Let $\alpha_t$ be a (deterministic) process solution of $$d\alpha_t = (a-b\alpha_t)dt,\ \text{ where }\alpha_0 = 1.$$ This is an ODE and solving it yields the answer $\alpha_t = \frac{a-e^{-bt}}{b}$. Let us write $X_t = \alpha_t Y_t$ and search for an equation for $Y_t$. By the integration by parts formula (in differential form)  we have : $$dX_t = d\alpha_t Y_t+\alpha_t dY_t.$$ (The other term is zero since $\alpha$ has bounded variation.) Substituting the expression for $\alpha_t$ we get : $$dX_t = e^{-bt} Y_t + \alpha_t dY_t = (a-b\alpha_t)Y_tdt + \alpha_tdY_t.\quad (I)$$ On the other hand: $$dX_t = (a-bX_t)dt + cdB = (a-b\alpha_t Y_t)dt + cdB\quad(II).$$ Equating $(I)$ and $(II)$ we conclude that $$\alpha_tdY_t = cdB,$$

$$dY_t = \frac{c}{\alpha_t}dB_t.$$ With Y_0 = X_0/alpha_0 = x_0. This implies that: $$Y_t = x_0 + c \int_0^t \frac{1}{\alpha_s}dB_s = x_0 + c\int_0^t\frac{b}{a-e^{-bt}}dB_s. $$ Therefore the solution $X_t = \alpha_t Y_t$ can be obtained by multiplying $\alpha_t$ by $Y_t$.

1148418,Check my proof -- Intersection of an open interval and a Lebesgue measurable set,"This is a homework problem that seems overly simple and because of that I am having doubts. The problem statement: If $E \in \mathcal{L}$ and $m(E) > 0$, for any $\alpha < 1$ there is an open interval $I$ such that $m(E \cap I) > \alpha m(I)$. Here, $\mathcal{L}$ denotes the space of Lebesgue measurable sets. We have the following theorem: Theorem: If $E \in \mathcal{L}$, then 
  $$\begin{align*}
m(E) &= \inf\{m(U)\ \mid\ U \supset E,\ U\ \textrm{open}\}\\
 &= \sup\{m(K)\ \mid\ K \subset E,\ K\ \textrm{compact}\}
\end{align*}$$ My work: By the above theorem, $m(E) = \sup\{m(K)\ \mid\ K \subset E\}$ for $K$ compact. Then, for some $K \subset E$, $m(K) > 0$, which implies $K$ is nonempty and hence $E \cap K$ is nonempty. Choose $I$ to be the interior of some connected component of some such $K$. Then, $\mu(I) > 0$, and since $\alpha < 1$, we have $\alpha m(I) < m(I)$. But since $I \subset K \subset E$, then $E \cap I = I$, so $\alpha m(I) < m(E \cap I)$.

1148527,Necessary condition for the convergence of an improper integral.,"My calculus professor mentioned the other day that whenever we separate an improper integral into smaller integrals, the improper integral is convergent iff the two parts of the integral are convergent. For example: $$ \int_0^{+\infty} \frac{\log t}{t} \mathrm{d}t = \underbrace{\int_0^1 \frac{\log t}{t} \mathrm{d}t}_{\text{Diverges to }-\infty} + \underbrace{\int_1^{+\infty} \frac{\log t}{t} \mathrm{d}t}_{\text{Diverges to }+\infty} 
$$ So the integral would not converge, because one of the parts of the integral is divergent (or both in this case). However, I don't see why the part that diverges to $-\infty$ and the part that diverges to $+\infty$ cannot  cancel out and make it converge, how ever counterintuitive it may seem. It's what happens with the Dirichlet Integral to some extent, although the areas are bounded. It could be that the problem arises when things tend to $\pm\infty$ but if I recall correctly this is not a problem for the sum of an infinite series, e.g.: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n+B_n=
\underbrace{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n}_{\text{Diverges to }+\infty} + 
\underbrace{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}B_n}_{\text{Diverges to }-\infty} 
\nRightarrow \nexists \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n+B_n \vee \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n+B_n= \pm \infty $$ Where does the problem arise?

My book uses $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ for planes but online it says it is sometimes used as angles, which I assume in this case it is because the question asks for missing sides and angles. However, I am encountering any problems probably due to confusion. For a:
$$a)a=60°,\beta=90°, \gamma=75° $$ I used:
$$\cos(a)=\frac{\cos(\alpha)-\cos(\beta)\cos(\gamma)}{\sin(\beta) \sin(\gamma)}$$
and plugged in:
$$\cos(60°)=\frac{\cos(\alpha)-\cos(90°)\cos(75°)}{\sin(90°) \sin(75°)}$$
which means:
$$\frac{1}{2}=\frac{\cos(\alpha)-0}{\frac{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2}}{4}}=\frac{\cos(\alpha)}{\frac{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2}}{4}}=\frac{4\cos(\alpha)}{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2}}$$ $$\frac{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2}}{2}=4\cos(\alpha)$$
$$2(\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2})=\cos(\alpha)$$
$$\cos^{-1}(2\sqrt{6}+2\sqrt{2})=\alpha$$ So if I did it correct, do I just leave $\alpha$ like that? Or is it possible to find $\alpha$ without a calculator? If I had to guess, it would be some trig identity. Also, I would have to find side b and side c. So, I would calculate b and c using the law of cosines as well. So it would be:
$$\cos(b)=\frac{\cos(\beta)-\cos(\alpha)\cos(\gamma)}{\sin(\alpha) \sin(\gamma)}$$ and: $$\cos(c)=\frac{\cos(\gamma)-\cos(\beta)\cos(\alpha)}{\sin(\beta) \sin(\alpha)}$$ is that right?","['trigonometry', 'spherical-trigonometry', 'spherical-geometry']"

$$u=x^3+1$$
$$du=3x^2$$
