185050,What is the rationale behind the evaluation of the Expectation operator?,"We know that the expectation operator is defined for a random variable $x$, as such: $$
\mathbb{E} \left\{x\right\} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \: p_x(x) \; \mathrm{d}x
$$ Where $p_x{x}$ is the PDF of the random variable $x$. If there is an arbitrary(?) function $f$ acting on the random variable $x$, then the expected value of this function can also be written as: $$
\mathbb{E}\left\{f(x) \right\} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \: p_x(x) \: \mathrm{d}x
$$ My questions are: On many algorithms that I study, (statistical in nature), one often finds themselves taking the expected value of some entity, that is a function of the random variable $x$. In the reverse case, one can also find themselves poking around and manipulating the probability distribution function of $x$, and then we can 'take it back' into an expression using the expectation operator. Upon evaluating the expected value of $x$ however, ($\mathbb{E[x]})$, I often come across this estimation formula: $$
\mathbb{E}\left\{x\right\} \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N} x[n]
$$ and similarly, $$
\mathbb{E}\left\{f(x)\right\} \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N} f(x[n])
$$
Where each $x[n]$ is an individual realization of the random variable $x$. My question is, why is this formula true, and how did it come about? Every book I read seems to just include it as if it fell from the sky one day and no explanation is given as to why it is true. Could someone please give an intuitive and mathematical explanation for why - and more importantly, how this happens to be true? What is the history/rationale behind it? Many thanks.","['statistics', 'probability']"
185051,"Open map which ""almost fixes"" the boundary of an open ball","We have a continuous function $f:\bar{B}\to\mathbb{R}^n$, where $\bar{B}=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:\|x\|\le 1\}$, such that if $\|x\|=1$ then $\|f(x)-x\|<\epsilon$, for a fixed $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. We have to prove that $B(0,1-\epsilon)\subseteq f(\bar{B})$. This appears as a lemma in Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis . The author claims that it is possible to prove it without Brouwer's fixed point theorem , under the additional hypothesis that $f$ is open .

185058,Derivative of vector field,"I have just started learning differential geometry and I am trying to answer the following exercise (it's not for homework): Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional manifold with chart $(U, \varphi_U)$ and let $(x^1, \dots, x^n)$ be the corresponding local coordinates. Define a vector field on $U$ by $X = X^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$. We will try to define a ""derivative of vector fields"" by $$d_Y X = d_Y X^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$$
  By changing coordinates to $(\bar{x}^1, \dots, \bar{x}^n)$, show that unlike $df$, this operator is not independent of the choice of local coordinates. I think I understand the method, but I am not certain of the details. I believe what I have to do is first apply $d_Y$ to $X$ and then change coordinates, and then change coordinates and apply $d_Y$ to $X$, and show that the two results are not then same. Here is what I have attempted: Let $Y = Y^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$ (the question doesn't define $Y$ but presumably it's just another vector field). Then $$d_Y X = d_Y X^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$$ $$= dX^i(Y) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$$ $$= \frac{\partial X^i}{\partial x^j}Y^j \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$$ This is just another vector field, so transforming it according to the contravariant transformation we get the following messy expression: $$\frac{\partial \bar{x}^i}{\partial x^j} \frac{\partial X^j}{\partial x^k} Y^k \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^i},$$ which is $d_Y X$ in $\bar{x}^i$ coordinates (if I'm doing this correctly). Now I am trying to first change coordinates and apply $d_Y$ to $X$: first, in the new coordinates the vector field $X$ will be $\bar{X} = \frac{\partial \bar{x}^i}{\partial x^j}X^j \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^i}$ (contravariant transformation). So applying $d_Y$ to this we have $$d_Y \bar{X} = d_Y \left(\frac{\partial \bar{x}^i}{\partial x^j}X^j \right) \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^i}$$ Now I'm not sure what to do because it looks like $d_Y \left(\frac{\partial \bar{x}^i}{\partial x^j}X^j \right)$ will be terribly messy, and I don't really know how to evaluate it. Also, I don't know if I'm supposed to transform $Y$ to new coordinates as well (this would make the calculation even uglier) or if it's just $X$ that is transformed. Could anyone help?",['differential-geometry']
185073,"What is the essential difference between the terminologies ""associative"" and ""semi-group"".","Can only a map

$$(a* b)* c=a* (b* c),$$

$$*:A\times B\rightarrow C.$$ But $A=B=C$ is really the only restriction for a binary operation to be a magma. Hence, if my assumption is true, for a relation to be associative is the exact same thing as being a semi-group. This redundancy in notation (one could just state that a relation together with its set is a semigroup) just surprised me.

185080,Partial summation of a harmonic prime square series (Prime zeta functions),"I am trying to find the following series: $S=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{p_ip_j},A\leq p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_n \leq B, \lbrace A,B\rbrace \in \mathbb{N}$ Where $\lbrace p_1,p_2, \dots,p_n\rbrace$ are consecutive primes.
  I am stuck at $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{{p_i}^2}$. Motivation: This problem is related to checking the number of integers in a sequence that are divisible by two of the $n$ primes. Example of $S$: when $A = 10, B=20$, the primes are $\lbrace 11,13,17,19\rbrace$ and the sum $S$ is: $\dfrac{1}{11\times 13}+\dfrac{1}{11\times 17}+\dfrac{1}{11\times 19}+\dfrac{1}{13\times 17} + \dfrac{1}{13\times 19}+\dfrac{1}{17\times 19}$ Work done thus far: I have worked out that the sum is equivalent to: $S=\dfrac{1}{2}\left( \left(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{p_i}\right)^2-\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{{p_i}^2}\right)=\dfrac{1}{2}\left((S_1)^2-S_2\right)$ This can be done by doubling $S$ and adding $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{{p_i}^2}$ and realizing that it equals $\left(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{p_i}\right)^2$. Say $S=\dfrac{1}{p_1p_2}+\dfrac{1}{p_1p_3}+\dfrac{1}{p_2p_3}$. Then $2S+\dfrac{1}{p_1p_1}+\dfrac{1}{p_2p_2} +\dfrac{1}{p_3p_3}= $ $\dfrac{1}{p_1p_1}+\dfrac{1}{p_1p_2}+\dfrac{1}{p_1p_3}+$ $\dfrac{1}{p_2p_1}+\dfrac{1}{p_2p_2}+\dfrac{1}{p_2p_3}+$ $\dfrac{1}{p_3p_1}+\dfrac{1}{p_3p_2}+\dfrac{1}{p_3p_3}$ $=(S_1)^2$ $\implies 2S=(S_1)^2+S_2$ This is sort of like completing a square matrix, where original sum is upper triangle, the doubling fills the lower triangle and the squared primes fills the diagonal. Partial solution: There is a nice estimation for $S_1:\displaystyle\sum_{p\in prime}^{x}=ln(ln(x))+B_1+o(1)$. So given $A,B:$ $S_1=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{p_i}$ $\approx \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{B}\dfrac{1}{p_i}-\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{A}\dfrac{1}{p_i}$ $\approx (ln(ln(B))+B_1+o(1))-(ln(ln(A))+B_1+o(1))$ $\approx ln(ln(B))-ln(ln(A))=ln(\dfrac{B}{A})$ Similarly, there is an estimation for the harmonic sum of prime squares . However, this estimation apparently is for an infinite series and so I am unable to use a similar trick that derives $S_1$.","['prime-numbers', 'analytic-number-theory', 'sequences-and-series']"
185081,Calculating the group co-homology of the symmetric group $S_3$ with integer coefficients.,"I have been trying for a while to make sense of Ex V.3.5 & Ex III.10.1 in Brown's book 'Co-homology of Groups': Calculate the Co-homology of $S_3$ with co-efficients in $\mathbb{Z}$, possibly using cup products. Ex III.10.1 says that it is possible to calculate this using III.10.3: The p-primary part of $H^n(S_3, M)$ is isomorphic to the $S_3$-invariant elements of $H^n(H, M)$ where $H$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. The Sylow $p$-subgroups of $S_3$ are a copy of $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$, so the first step I suppose is to compute the $S_3$-invariant elements of $H^2(\mathbb{Z}_3, \mathbb{Z})$.  The only method I know to compute these is using a resolution $F_*$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ by $\mathbb{Z}[S_3]$ modules: finding a generator of $H^2(\mathbb{Z}_3, \mathbb{Z})$ in the chain complex $\mathcal{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{Z}_3]}(F_*, \mathbb{Z})$ and watching what happens to it under the action of $S_3$.  At this point I am completely stuck, I cannot think of a way to explicitly find a generator of $H^2(\mathbb{Z}_3, \mathbb{Z})$ in this chain complex. So I am wondering, have I started going about this the right way?  Perhaps there is an easier chain complex in which I can compute the $S_3$-invariant elements, or a way to compute what such a generator of $H^2(\mathbb{Z}_3, \mathbb{Z})$?

185082,calculator errors and rational root theorem,"In this question we were asked for roots of $9x^3 - 18x^2 - 4x + 8 = 0$ and I remarked on the rational root theorem.  In fact, the roots are $2, \frac 23, \frac {-2}3$.  When checking them it would be nice to use an exact form of the fractions, but in fact many will use a calculator.  When checking $\frac 23$, mine makes an error of about $10^{-11}$. It is not hard to estimate the error if the value is really a root, using the machine epsilon times the size of the terms in the polynomial, so one will not reject a true root, but what about the other direction? For a polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients of reasonable size, how small can $f(x_0)$ be where $x_0$ is a root candidate from the rational root theorem but not a root?  If the real roots are rational we are limited by the fact that the rationals can't be too close together.  One of my first efforts was $(x-2+i)(x-2-i)(3x-8)=3x^3-20x^2+47x-40$, which has $f(2)=-2$, pretty small compared to the terms but not small enough to fool anybody.

185084,Universal Correlation measure -- ranking correlations,"I have time series data of experimental observations for two related processes.
I want to measure correlation for use in further analysis. Correlation of the series changes over time and across different length sliding windows on the data.  To clarify, I might want to look at correlation over 10, 20, 30, 40, ..., n periods, each of these essentially sliding windows across the data.  Kind of analogous to looking at a bunch of simple moving average windows. Historically and over future observations, one of these correlation windows will prove a better representation of the data than the rest.  But the random nature of the underlying processes (whose distribution one may not know) makes settling on one window by evaluating the data historically an unsound approach. Universal - A possible approach? Information theory applied to the areas of data compression and portfolio allocation has produced what often gets referred to as a “Universal” approach to attacking a similar problem. Thomas Cover a principle advocate for the idea saw the universal approach as a general method for multi-variate optimization of random processes even where one had no idea of the underlying distribution. Cover's book, Elements of Information Theory , looks at a couple of examples of this idea. Cover seeing this as an optimization technique led me to ask this question here on the Mathematics SE site rather that say the statistics site. Example - Universal data compression In Universal Data Compression, one can see that an internet router can’t know the optimal data compression algorithm to use prior to its actually reading the packet of information or stream of data.  Universal Data Compression addresses the problem with the following steps: Ranks each of its available compression algorithms as to their effectiveness after each stream of data has passed through the router. Calculates the cumulative ranking for each of the compression algorithms Identifies the mean cumulative rank weighted compression algorithm. Uses this mean cumulative rank weighted algorithm on the next stream of data it receives. Note that the approach does not use a follow the leader strategy. Over time this method will asymptopically approach the effectiveness of the best single algorithm that one could have picked at the beginning.  A Darwin quote captures the key idea behind a Universal approach: ""It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most
  intelligent, but the one most responsive to change."" Universal approaches keep one in a pretty good place most of the time, which does very well over time. Universal Correlation So it occurred to me that I might develop a related method, Universal Correlation with the following steps: Rank each correlation window’s effectiveness (more about this below) at each time step. Calculate the cumulative ranking for each of the correlation windows Identify the mean cumulative rank weighted correlation window (or the one nearest the mean). I'll then use this in another stage of analysis. Now my question What measure can I use to rank each correlation window’s effectiveness at each time step? ... The following earlier question may have some bearing on an answer: What is a common way to measure the “goodness of fit” of an individual data point to a correlation? This may help clarify: At a given point in time, I have calculated correlation for some number of windows on the data up until that point in time (going back, 10 periods, 20 periods, 30, periods, ...). Now I need a measure to rank the effectiveness or accuracy of each of the time periods correlation relative to each other. Put yet another way: What do I rank the measures of correlation against?","['optimization', 'multivariable-calculus', 'information-theory']"

I could conclude, for example, that if the lift is $\bar{f}$, then for any $x_1, x_2 \in \mathbb{R}$, $\bar{f}(x_1+x_2)=\bar{f}(x_1)+\bar{f}(x_2)+2n\pi$ for some $n\in \mathbb{Z}$.

185249,Strategies for arranging coins in a circle,"Suppose you have $n$ identical circular coins and you would like to arrange them on the table so that their edges touch and their centers lie on a circle. Mathematically, there is no trouble. ""Just"" put the center of each coin at $re^{2ik\pi/n}$ for $k$ in $\{0, 1\ldots, n-1\}$ and some suitable $r$. But in practice, one can't easily calculate $e^{2ik\pi/n}$ and one wouldn't be able to position the coins even if the coordinates of their centers were given. What I want are heuristics that allow one to position the coins approximately correctly, which can be executed by someone with an ordinarily good eye and ordinarily good hands, without any special measuring devices. Good solutions for $n\le 3$ are trivial. There is also a good solution for the special case of $n=6$, which is to arrange the six coins around a seventh. In practice it does not seem too hard to arrange four coins into a square, by first estimating the right angles and then looking to see if the resulting quadrilateral is visibly rhombic. But I would be glad to see a more methodical approach. This is a soft question. I expect the solution to be informed by mathematics, but not purely mathematical.","['geometry', 'puzzle', 'soft-question']"

Is Nering defining the span of the empty set to be the set containing the zero vector or is this something you can prove from the definition of span? I sense it is the latter, but the proof seems a bit tricky since you would be saying that {0} = Span of the indexed set of vectors in the empty set. But since the empty set has no vectors, it is not clear to me what its span would be.","['vector-spaces', 'matrices', 'span', 'linear-algebra']"
185266,L'Hôpital's Rule for $ \frac{\infty}{\infty-\infty} $?,"I'm currently trying to find this improper integral:
$$ \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}+1}} dx $$ I started off by splitting it into a proper integral, and then into the sum of two integrals:
$$ = \lim_{a\rightarrow\infty} \int^{a}_{-a}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}+1}}dx = \lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}(\int^{0}_{-a}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}+1}}dx + \int^{a}_{0}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}+1}}dx) $$ To calculate the integrals I used the trig. substitution $ x=b\tan\theta $ with $ b=1 $, which would give the differential $ dx=sec^{2}\theta d\theta $. The new limits of integration would then be $ [-\frac{\pi}{2},0] $ and $ [0,\frac{\pi}{2}] $ because as $ x\rightarrow\pm\infty $, $ \theta\rightarrow\pm\frac{\pi}{2} $, so the integrals and limit can be rewritten as:
$$ = \lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}(\int^{0}_{-a}\frac{\sec^{2}\theta}{\sqrt{\tan^{2}\theta+1}}d\theta + \int^{a}_{0}\frac{\sec^{2}\theta}{\sqrt{\tan^{2}\theta+1}}d\theta) $$ ...which can then simplify to:
$$ = \lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}(\int^{0}_{-a}\frac{\sec^{2}\theta}{\sqrt{\sec^{2}\theta}}d\theta +\int^{a}_{0}\frac{\sec^{2}\theta}{\sqrt{\sec^{2}\theta}}d\theta) = \lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}(\int^{0}_{-a}\frac{\sec^{2}\theta}{|\sec\theta|}d\theta+\int^{a}_{0}\frac{\sec^{2}\theta}{|\sec\theta|}d\theta) $$ The absolute values on the secants can be removed because on the interval $ [-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}] $, the secant function is positive.
$$ = \lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}(\int^{0}_{-a}\frac{\sec^{2}\theta}{\sec\theta}d\theta+\int^{a}_{0}\frac{\sec^{2}\theta}{\sec\theta}d\theta) = \lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}(\int^{0}_{-a}\sec\theta d\theta+\int^{a}_{0}\sec\theta d\theta) $$ The antiderivative of $ \sec\theta = \ln|\sec\theta+\tan\theta|+C $, so the integrals become:
$$ = \lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}(\ln|\sec\theta+\tan\theta|\bigg|^{0}_{-a} + \ln|\sec\theta+\tan\theta|\bigg|^{a}_{0}) $$
$$ = \lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}((\ln|\sec(0)+\tan(0)|-\ln|\sec(-a)+\tan(-a)|)+(\ln|\sec(a)+tan(a)|-\ln|\sec(0)+tan(0)|)) $$ Since $ \sec(0) = 1 $ and $ \tan(0) = 0 $, the value of $ \ln|\sec(0)+tan(0)| = \ln(1) = 0 $. The limit can be rewritten as:
$$ = \lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}((0-\ln|\sec(-a)+\tan(-a)|)+(\ln|\sec(a)+tan(a)|-0)) $$
$$ = \lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}(-\ln|\sec(-a)+\tan(-a)|+\ln|\sec(a)+tan(a)|) $$ The tangent function has been shown to be odd, and the secant function even, so $ \sec(-a) = \sec(a) $ and $ \tan(-a) = -\tan(a) $. Therefore, applying and then commuting the addition, we have:
$$ = \lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}(\ln|\sec(a)+tan(a)|-\ln|\sec(a)-\tan(a)|) $$ Subtraction of logarithms become division, so $ \ln|\sec(a)+tan(a)|-\ln|\sec(a)-\tan(a)| $ $ = \ln\left|\frac{\sec(a)+\tan(a)}{\sec(a)-\tan(a)}\right| $, which becomes:
$$ = \lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}\left(\ln\left|\frac{\sec(a)+\tan(a)}{\sec(a)-\tan(a)}\right|\right)$$ Here's where I'm confused: can you take the natural log of the limit of the fraction (i.e., $$ \ln\left|\lim_{a\rightarrow\pi/2}\left(\frac{\sec(a)+\tan(a)}{\sec(a)-\tan(a)}\right)\right| $$
), or does the limit not exist? And, if you can take the natural log of the limit, how would you go about evaluating the limit of the fraction? Since $ \sec(\frac{\pi}{2}) ""="" \infty $ and $ \tan(\frac{\pi}{2}) ""="" \infty $, would there be some form of L'Hôpital's Rule you'd have to use, since $ \frac{\infty}{\infty-\infty} $ is indeterminate?","['improper-integrals', 'calculus', 'integration', 'limits']"
185287,Number of points at which a tangent touches a curve,"My teacher told me that we are mistaken coming out of school that tangent tocuhes a point at one point. According to him, a tangent is just a special type of secant where two points share the same position but actually are just two different points. My friend said it could happen if we think of tangent as a secant where the two points tend to each other. I am dissatisfied with it. According to my teacher, the points share the location but are different. Since a point has only its position as its property, how are they differentiated among themselves? E.g. if we take the set of points on which tangent touches the curve (in a sufficiently small neighbourhood around the points), we get a single point since a set doesn't allow redundant entries. (Moreover, my teacher's tried to explanation his position using quadratic formula taking a quadratic equation as example; but I fail to recognise its relevance except that a quadratic equation has at most two roots, and maybe that tangent has a solution with the curve. But isn't it the problem to begin with, how many solutions do the two of them have?) And I could agree with my friend too, but if we take a curve to be $y = x^2$ and tangent to be $y = 0$ than there is no point except $(0,0)$ that is common to them. No point in any small neighbourhood around $(0,0)$ is common to both. That seems to only reinforce myself. Question How many points do a tangent and its curve actually share? And if they are more than one, how can they be differentiated? That is, what is the application of treating two positions with same position differently?","['algebraic-geometry', 'complex-geometry']"

Then $$\int_a^b f'(t) \, dt = f(b) - f(a).$$ (This integral can be defined in any reasonable way, e.g. one can use the Bochner integral or a Riemann sum.) This theorem can be proven from Hahn-Banach, which allows you to reduce to the case $B = \mathbb{R}$. However, Hahn-Banach is independent of ZF. Recently I tried to prove this theorem without Hahn-Banach and found that I couldn't do it. The standard proof in the case $B = \mathbb{R}$ relies on the mean value theorem, which is not applicable here. I can only prove it (I think) under stronger hypotheses, e.g. $f'$ continuously differentiable or Lipschitz. So I am curious whether this theorem is even true in the absence of Hahn-Banach. It is likely that I am just missing some nice argument involving uniform continuity, but if I'm not, that would be good to know.","['set-theory', 'calculus', 'banach-spaces', 'logic', 'functional-analysis']"

I was trying to perform a surface integral I found online through the more general formulation of a differential form on a manifold.  This led to some trouble. I'm considering the integral over the vector field $F(x,y,z) = (2x,2y,2z)$ along a cylinder of radius $1$ and height $5$ paramtrized by $S(\theta, t) = (\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta),t).$  Calc 2 would tell me to just take the dot product of the vector field and the normal vector to the surface, but I wanted to do this from a manifolds perspective, according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form 's integration section.  Following its lead, I identify $F(x,y,z) = 2x dx + 2y dy + 2z dz$ as my differential form.  But now I immediately run into trouble as I'm trying to integrate a 1-form on a 2-manifold. Is there something intrinsically different about a surface integral versus an integral along a manifold?  It seems like a surface integral assigns to each 1-form a 2-form that measures flow through a manifold rather than actually integrating along its surface.",['multivariable-calculus']

It seems to favor the ""polar"" definition of a vector and then teach ""but it has Cartesian components [x_0, x_1 ... x_n] like so"" I felt that I reached a personal breakthrough when I realized that ""A vector is a higher dimensional generalization of a 'number' or 'value' or 'quantity' "" This has been how I've always thought of them.

            0         5 Just like the vector <5,5> is a two dimensional analog of this notion. It just so happens that the circumstances change in subtle ways - (the ability to have a 'distance' or 'absolute value' different from either of the components and the notion of a direction when graphed). Also, it seems that every teacher is very very careful to distinguish a vector from a point. However, this seems trivial in concept, as we wouldn't distinguish ""the position '5' on a number line"" from ""the value 5"" or ""distance from zero to 5"" Why is the 'magnitude and direction' definition favored?","['linear-algebra', 'education', 'definition']"

Now, we can ask whether the same is true about algebraic varieties . i.e where $X,Y$ algebraic varieties over some algebraically closed field $k$ and $\phi$ a morphism of algebraic varieties (with the differential interpreted suitably). Well, the general answer is NO with the canonical counterexample being the Frobenius morphism $x\mapsto x^p$ for $\mathbb{A}^1\to \mathbb{A}^1$ when $\mbox{char}(k)=p$ (it's not constant, but it has zero differential). It seems though that in zero characteristic this problem can't happen, but I would like to see a proof of that (elementary as possible, even computational) or a counterexample. My best try: Using standard arguments this can be reduced to the case where $X$ is irreducible affine and $Y=\mathbb{A}^1$. Embedding $X$ in $\mathbb{A}^n$ and translating to algebra we get the following formulation: Let $R=k[x_1,...,x_n]$ , $f\in R$ and $P=(g_1,...,g_r)$ a prime ideal in $R$. Suppose that for all $a\in k^n$ such that $g_1(a)=...=g_r(a)=0$ we have $df|_a\in \mbox{Span}(dg_1|_a,...,dg_r|_a)$, then there is $c\in k$ such that $f-c\in P$. It is known (though still not trivial) that if we had $df|_a\equiv0$ for all $a$ in the mutual zero set of $g_1,...,g_r$, which is equivalent to saying that all the partial derivatives of $f$ are in $P$, then we would have the desired conclusion.

By solving the linear system I can get the projective transformation matrix. Similarly, I conceive that a 3D projective mapping can be denoted as a rational linear mapping as well. And this rational linear mapping can map a frustum to a NDC cube.(note that because of the use of homogeneous coordinate, the last element of matrix(right bottom one) can be set to 1) $$

Specifically, this would mean $x^{N+1}<\epsilon$ for some fixed $N$. But if we now pick $x$ such that $1 > x > ε^{\frac{1}{N+1}}$, then this would lead to a contradiction, therefore $f_n(x)$ is not uniformly convergent. However, I was wondering why couldn't we take $n$ to infinity. If $0 < x < 1$, then $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} |f_n(x) - f(x)| = 0$ (which is less than $\epsilon$).

Weak convergence in this space means $$\lim_{m\to \infty}\int_0^T\langle \phi,u_m\rangle dt= \int_0^T\langle \phi,u\rangle dt$$ for all $\phi\in L^2(0,T;H^{-1}(U))$. I know that for every $\phi\in H^{-1}(U)$ there exists $\phi^0,\dots,\phi^n\in L^2(U)$ such that $\langle \phi,u\rangle = \int_U \phi^0u+\sum_{i=1}^n \phi^iu_{x_i}dx$ for all $u\in H^1_0(U)$. Now my question is, why does $\int_0^TB[u_m,v;t]dt$ converges to $\int_0^TB[u,v;t]$? Of course, we have to use the weak convergence, but I do not see how exactly. Just for completeness: for a Banach space $X$, we define $L^2(0,T;X)$ as the space of all measurable function $f:[0,T]\to X$ such that $\sqrt{\int_0^T\|f\|^2_Xdt}<\infty$.","['sobolev-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
185888,why don't we define vector multiplication component-wise?,"I was just wondering why we don't ever define multiplication of vectors as individual component multiplication.  That is, why doesn't anybody ever define $\langle a_1,b_1 \rangle \cdot \langle a_2,b_2 \rangle$ to be $\langle a_1a_2, b_1b_2 \rangle$?  Is the resulting vector just not geometrically interesting?",['linear-algebra']

$$
\lim_{M\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{M!}{\left(M+i\right)!}x^{i}}
$$ Is this dependent on the value of $x$? Thank you very much....",['limits']
185897,Help solving differential equation,"I want to solve the following differential equation: $y[t]$ : vertical position (height) of the object at time t $y_c$  : height of the ceiling $y_e$  : equilibrium point, the height at which the mass will stop at the end of its movement. $a[t]$ : acceleration at time t $t$    : time $k$    : spring coefficient $m$    : mass of the object $G$    : gravity $$\begin{align}
&F = -ky[t] - mG \\
\Leftrightarrow &ma[t] = -ky[t] -mG  \\
\Leftrightarrow&my''[t] = -ky[t] -mG\\
\Leftrightarrow&y''[t] = -\dfrac{k}{m}y[t] -G
\end{align}$$
subject to: $$y[0] = y_c\\y'[0] = 0$$ I'm not really sure how to do so. The equation is for modeling the movement of a falling object that is attached to a spring that is attached to the ceiling, thus gravity ($G$) is involved.

185931,Universal separable Banach algebras,"The well-known Banach–Mazur theorem says that $C([0, 1])$ is a universal separable Banach space, in the sense that if $X$ is any separable Banach space then there is a map $f : X \to C([0, 1])$ which is both linear and isometric.  Note that $C([0, 1])$ also has the structure of a Banach algebra. My question is this: Is $C([0, 1])$ universal for separable commutative Banach algebras?  Of course a separable Banach algebra is a separable Banach space, so there is a linear isometry into $C([0, 1])$, but I'm asking if that map can also be taken to preserve the multiplication operation. If $C([0, 1])$ is not universal for separable commutative Banach algebras, does there exist such a universal object?  I'm interested mostly in ZFC results, but would also not mind hearing consistent answers (especially if they are consistent with $\neg CH$).","['banach-algebras', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"
