399568,Examples of non-cyclic group with a cyclic automorphism group,"In introduction to algebra we got the exercise: Let $G$ be a group. Show that when $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ is cyclic $G$ is abelian. This doesn't make that much trouble. Denote the center (all commuting elements) with $Z$.
Then $G/Z$ is isomorphic to $\operatorname{Int}(G)$ where $\operatorname{Int}(G)$ denotes the subgroup of inner automorphisms. As every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic we have $G/Z$ is cyclic and hence $G$ is abelian (As a group which is cyclic of the center is abelian). So the question is: Is there a non cyclic group with a cyclic automorphism group?

399570,Proving that Bombieri's Theorem implies Linnik's theorem,"I'm stuck on a line in the proof of Bombieri implies Linnik, where Bombieri : 
  For primitive $\chi$ mod $q$ with $q \leq T$ we define $$N(\alpha, T; \chi)=\#\{\rho=\beta+i\gamma \;:\; \Lambda(\rho,\chi)=0, \beta>\alpha, |\gamma|<T\}.$$ There exists $c>0$ such that, for all $T \geq 2$ and all $1/2 \leq \alpha <1$, $$\sum_{q \leq T}\sum_{\chi \text{ mod }q}^*N(\alpha,T;\chi)=O(T^{c(1-\alpha)})$$ where the asterisk on the sum over characters indicates that only primitive characters are to be inlcuded. If there exists a real primitive character $\chi_1$ mod $q_1$ with $q_1<T$, such that $\Lambda(s,\chi_1)$ has zero $\beta_1>1-\frac{\delta}{\log T}$, then we have the improved estimate $$\sum_{q \leq T}\sum_{\chi \text{ mod }q}^*N'(\alpha,T;\chi)=O(T^{c(1-\alpha)}(1-\beta_1)\log T)$$ where the ' on the $N(\alpha,T;\chi)$ indicates that the single exceptional zero is to be excluded. Linnik : If $a$ and $q$ are coprime then there exists a prime $p \equiv a$ mod $q$ with $p<O(q^{O(1)})$. In the exceptional zero case, assuming Bombieri, I've got to the point where $$\sum_{p \leq x, p \equiv a \text{ mod }q }\log p \geq \frac{1}{2 \phi(q)}\left(x-\frac{x^{\beta_1}}{\beta_1}\right)+O\left(\frac{x(\log x)^2}{T}\right)$$ for $T=q^A$ with $A>3$ and $x=T^B$ with $B>12$ a large constant. I also know that $$\beta_1\leq 1-\frac{c}{\sqrt{T}(\log T)^2}.$$ I think what I want to show is that $x^{\beta_1}\leq x^{1-\epsilon}$ for some $\epsilon>0$, because since $(O(x(\log x)^2/T)=O(x^{1-\epsilon})$ for small enough $\epsilon$, Linnik's theorem will follow.

399605,How to solve the two dimensional Laplace's equation for certain cases?,"Had a doubt regarding Laplace's equation.
In many textbooks, the general solution to the two dimensional Laplace equation is mentioned as: $$\Phi(\rho,\phi) = A_{0} + B_{0}\ln(\rho) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\rho^n(A_n\cos(n\phi) + B_n \sin(n\phi)) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\rho^{-n}(C_n \cos(n\phi) + D_n \sin(n\phi))$$ in polar coordinates. For convenience, I will name the two summation terms as: $$T_1 = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\rho^n(A_n\cos(n\phi) + B_n \sin(n\phi))$$ $$T_2 =  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\rho^{-n}(C_n \cos(n\phi) + D_n \sin(n\phi))$$ Not much has really been mentioned on whether these two series, $T_1$ and $T_2$ converge or not. When the solution space does not include either zero or infinity it is generally implicitly assumed that they converge. When the solution space includes the origin, generally the procedure has been to equate the coefficients of the second series, $T_2$, to zero, in other words, to exclude the second series from the solution. 
In many physical problems of interest however, the solution space includes both the origin of the coordinate system and is an unbounded region in all directions. My question is, how can we use the above expansions to handle such cases? Especially when there is a boundary condition of zero (or $ k ln(\rho) $) at infinity. The radius of convergence doesn't seem to be known a priori as the coefficients are unknown. 
For example, if you consider the case of an infinitely long conducting cable of arbitrary but uniform cross-section, (Arbitrary meaning that it need not be something geometrical or symmetric like a circle or a square, and could even be concave; and uniform meaning that the shape and area of the cross-section does not change in the $z$ direction so it can be reduced to a two dimensional problem.) maintained at a constant potential $V$, and where the potential is taken to approach $ k ln(\rho) $ at infinity. It may often be convenient to choose the origin outside the cable. In this case, if I exclude the term $T_2$ (for finiteness at the origin), again the boundary condition $\Phi\to k \ln(\rho)$ as $\rho\to\infty$ will imply that the coefficients in the term $T_1$ become zero as well. So the solution appears to be trivially $\Phi = A_0$ (obviously wrong!) even before I apply the boundary condition $\Phi = V$ at the surface of the cable. 
Can you let me know what I am doing wrong? Can you throw some light on this?
Thanks.","['harmonic-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

399638,What is a simple axiomatisation of groups using division?,"I recall from an old exercise I did as an undergrad that groups can be axiomatised using division rather than multiplication: A group is a non-empty set equipped with a binary division operator / satisfying some equational axioms. I don't remember the axioms, but I do remember that $x/y = x\cdot y^{-1}$. Because $x/x = 1$ and $1/x = x^{-1}$ we can recover the group structure by setting $x\cdot y = x/(1/y)$ and so such an axiomatisation should exist.

399641,Image of the Norm on a Finite Dimensional Extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$,"I've been trying to see whether following assertion is true in order to give a quick proof of another problem I was doing: if $K$ is a finite dimensional extension of the $p$-adic numbers $\mathbb{Q}_p$, we have the multiplicative field norm $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}_p}: K \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}_p$.  While the norm is not guaranteed to be surjective, is it always possible to find some $k \in K$ such that $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}_p}(k)$ has ($p$-adic) absolute value $1/p$? One way I would imagine to do this is to show that there exist $\alpha, \beta \in K$ such that $|N(\alpha)| = p^A$ and $|N(\beta)| = p^B$ with $A, B$ relatively prime.  The assertion then follows because there exist integers $x, y$ such that $xA + yB = 1$, whence $\alpha^{-x}\beta^{-y} \in K$ with $|N(\alpha^{-x}\beta^{-y})| = |N(\alpha^{-x})N(\beta^{-y})| = |a|^{-x}|b|^{-y} = p^{-Ax}p^{-By} = 1/p$. My claim seems to me altogether reasonable since otherwise there exists some prime $q$ such that the absolute value $p^s$ of every $N(k)$ as $k$ runs through all of $K$ will be such that $s$ is always divisible by $q$, which doesn't seem right.","['field-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"
399656,Question about a proof that $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$,"This is from Ross's elementary analysis book. The statement is if $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a<b$ then there exists a rational $r \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $a<r<b$. I don't understand an important part of the proof which I will point out. Here is the proof: Since $b-a>0$ then by the archimidean property there exists a natural number call it $n$ such that $n(b-a)>1$. Now we must prove there exists an integer $m$ such that $an<m<bn$. By the archimidean property again there exists an integer $k$ such that $k>\max(|an|, |bn|)$ so that $-k<an<bn<k$. Then the set $$\{j \in \mathbb{Z}: {-k<j \leq k}\text{ and }an<j\}$$ is finite and nonempty and we can set $m = \min\{j \in \mathbb{Z}: {-k<j \leq k}\text{ and }an<j\}$. Then $an < m$ but $m - 1 \leq an$. Also, we have $m = (m - 1) + 1 \leq an + 1 < an + (bn - an) = bn$. Comment: I get up to the point how the author sets$ k$ to be the integer that is larger than both $an$ and $bn$. And since $a<b$ we get the bounded inequality $-k<an<bn<k$. From here on this is where I get confused.  He creates a set  $\{j \in \mathbb{Z}: {-k<j \leq k}\text{ and }an<j\}$ which he calls finite which I see and nonempty (I'm guessing since this set has a least upper bound $k$ thus it is nonempty). But then he lets  $m = \min\{j \in \mathbb{Z}: {-k<j \leq k}\text{ and }an<j\}$ which follows $an<m$ but $m - 1 \leq an$.

399671,Divisibility of an expression involving the Möbius function,"Let $d$ and $n$ be integers, with $n\geq 2$, and define $$R(n,d) := \sum_{k\mid n} \mu( n/k)d^k,$$ where $\mu$ is the Möbius function . It can be shown (see below for an arithmetic proof) that $n\mid R(n,d)$. My question is whether anyone knows of a combinatorial proof of this fact? Feel free to make $d\geq 1$ if this makes the question have a more combinatorial flavor. Sketch: Suppose $n$ has prime decomposition $n = p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_r^{e_r}$. We prove that $n\mid R(n,d)$ by induction on $r\geq 1$. When $r = 1$, so $n = p^e$, one computes $$R(p^e, d) = d^{p^e} - d^{p^{e-1}} = d^{p^{e-1}}\left(d^{p^{e-1}(p-1)} - 1\right).$$ If $p\mid d$, it's easy to see $n = p^e\mid d^{p^{e-1}}$, so $n\mid R(n,d)$. If $p\nmid d$, then Fermat's little theorem gives that $d^{p-1} = 1 + pm$ for some $m\in \mathbb{Z}$, so $$d^{p^{e-1}(p-1)} - 1 = (1 + pm)^{p^{e-1}} - 1 = (1 + p^em') - 1 = p^em' = nm'$$ for some $m'\in \mathbb{Z}$. This proves the base case of the induction. To do the induction step, assume $n = ap^e$, where $p\nmid a$, and you know that $a\mid R(a,d)$ for all integers $d$. One now computes $$R(n,d) = R(a, d^{p^e}) - R(a, d^{p^{e-1}}),$$ and hence by induction $a\mid R(n,d)$. On the other hand, $$R(a,d^{p^e}) - R(a,d^{p^{e-1}}) = \sum_{k\mid a}\mu(a/k)\left(d^{kp^e} - d^{kp^{e-1}}\right),$$ and every term on the right hand side is divisible by $d^{p^e} - d^{p^{e-1}}$, which in turn is divisible by $p^e$ from our work in the previous paragraph. Thus $p^e\mid R(n,d)$. Since $(a,p) = 1$, it follows that $n = ap^e\mid R(n,d)$, completing the proof. Context: When $d\geq 2$, the expression  $R(n,d)$ is the degree of the $n$-th dynatomic polynomial of any polynomial map $f\colon \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ of degree $d$, so these expressions have some dynamical significance. For many (but not all) such $f$, the  $n$th dynatomic polynomial of $f$ is the polynomial whose roots are exactly the $f$-periodic points with exact period $n$. Since these points break up into cycles of length $n$ under the dynamics of $f$, it therefore follows that $R(n,d)$ is divisible by $n$.","['complex-dynamics', 'elementary-number-theory', 'arithmetic-dynamics', 'combinatorics']"

399704,Show that any nonabelian group $G$ of order $12$ which contains a normal subgroup of order $4$ must be isomorphic to $A_4$.,"Show that any nonabelian group $G$ of order $12$ which contains a normal subgroup of order $4$ must be isomorphic to $A_4$. Hint. Show that $G$ is a split extension of a group of order $4$ by $\mathbb Z_3$, and, using the calculation of $Aut(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2)$ given in Problem 14 of Exercises 4.6.13, show that here is only one such split extension which is nonabelian. (Exercise 4.6.13 tells us that $Aut(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \cong S_3$.) We know that $A_4 \cong (\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3$ Assume that $G$ is a group of order $12$ which has a normal subgroup $H$ of order $4$. Since $3\mid 12$ and is prime, we know that there exists a group of order $3$ in $G$. So we have an extension $f: \mathbb Z_3 \rightarrow G$ with kernel $H$. Since $H$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ are relatively prime, $f$ must be a split extension. Since split extensions are semidirect products, we just need to classify $H \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3$, right? We know that $H \cong \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$ or $\mathbb Z_4$. Case 1: $\mathbb Z_4 \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3$ We have $\alpha: \mathbb Z_3 \rightarrow Aut(\mathbb Z_4) \cong \mathbb Z_3$, and let $\mathbb Z_3 = \langle a \rangle$ $\bullet$ The homomorphism is trivial $\implies$ $\mathbb Z_4 \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \times \mathbb Z_3$. Since both $\mathbb Z_4$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ are abelian, and the action is trivial; $\mathbb Z_3 \times \mathbb Z_3$ must also be abelian. $\bullet$ $\alpha_1 : a \rightarrow a$ $\bullet$ $\alpha_2 : a \rightarrow a^2$ Let $\iota: H \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha} K$, $\iota': H \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha'} K$, $s: K \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha} K$, and $s' : K \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha'} K$ There is a proposition in our textbook that states: Let $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ be hoomorphisms of K into Aut(H). Then the following conditions are equivalent: $\alpha$ is conjugate to $\alpha' \circ g$, with $g \in Aut(K)$ There is an isomorphism $\phi: H \rtimes_{\alpha} K \rightarrow H \rtimes_{\alpha'} K$ such that $im(\phi \circ \iota) = im \iota'$ and $im(\phi \circ s) = im s'$. there is a commutative diagram (I cannot draw this here but this is on page 116 here ). I'm not sure if I'm using 1. in the proposition correctly, but this is what I said about $\alpha1$ and $\alpha2$: We know that $e\alpha_2e^{-1} = \alpha_1(a)$, so they must be conjugate. Case 2: We need to classify $(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb Z_3$ We have $\alpha: \mathbb Z_3 \rightarrow Aut(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \cong S_3$ $\bullet$ If $\alpha$ is trivial, we have $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_3 \cong \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_6$. Since both $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_6$ are abelian and the action is trivial, $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_6$ is also abelian. We know that there are two elements in $S_3$ of order 3: (123) and (132). So the other two homomorphisms must be: $\bullet$ $\beta_1: a \rightarrow (123)$ $\bullet$ $\beta_2: a \rightarrow (132)$. Now I want to show that $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ must be conjugate, but I'm stuck here. My problem is that, in order to use the proposition, I need to have automorphisms , but since I'm using the fact that $S_3 \cong Aut(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2)$, I'm not using automorphisms, I'm just using elements. So something like (for example) $\beta_1(13)$ makes no sense, right? Basically, this was my plan: I was going to show that $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ were conjugate. Since the problem is talking about nonabelian groups, the trivial homomorphisms of both cases don't really matter... since they both give abelian groups, right? So I would then try to prove that $(\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2) \rtimes_{\beta_1} Z_3 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes_{\alpha_1} \mathbb Z_3$, and then I would be done, right?

399764,Proving Bijections in $\mathbb{R}^n$,"I have a question that may seem trivial or silly, however I'll try to make my point clear. I'm a student of Mathematical Physics and unfortunately my college doesn't offer a set theory course, so that we are not taught to prove bijections between arbitrary sets. The single variable calculus course we have teaches us to prove bijections by looking for one inverse function in a very clear way: we write $y = f(x)$, try to solve for $x$ and then create the function desired (it's of course more formal than that, first we prove injectivity showing that $f(x)=f(y)$ implies $x=y$ and then we look for the inverse to prove surjectivity). The multivariable calculus course on the other hand doesn't talk about proving bijections from subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ to subsets of $\mathbb{R}^m$. On the other hand we have the analysis course, the topology course and the differential geometry course that all presumes we know how to prove those bijections and so on. Now, I'm confused, because none of our courses teaches to prove that kind of thing. If we have some function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, proving injectivity is the easiest part, but for surjectivity, seeking for some inverse seems kind of painful. By now I'm studying differential geometry of curves and surfaces (it uses Do Carmo's book), and the only thing I'm needing is this basic notion on how to prove bijections in these cases (for instance, when we come to show that something is a chart, proving continuity is rather easy, we have been taught on how to do it, but proving the bijection is complicated). Is there any general guidelines as there is in the case of functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$? Is there any reference that can be given that treats this in a good way? Again, I know this is basic and that we all should know before coming to things like differential geometry, but since the course doesn't teach this, I came to ask here to fill this gap.

I have been told that it is possible to find the order of the largest cyclic subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_{720})$ without considering automorphisms of $\mathbb{Z}_{720}$.  Here's what I have: We have that $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_{720}) \cong U(720)$.  Then since $720=2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$ we have $U(720)=U(16) \oplus U(9) \oplus U(5)$.  Some simple computations show that $U(16)$ is not cyclic, while $U(9)$ and $U(5)$ are, so $U(720) \cong U(16) \oplus \mathbb{Z}_6 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_4$.  Since $\gcd(6,4) \ne 1$, $\mathbb{Z}_6 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_4$ is not cyclic, so this, coupled with the fact that the noncyclic $U(16)$ of order 8 would have a cyclic subgroup of order 4 at the most, gives us that the largest cyclic subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_{720})$ is of order $6$.

In homogeneous coordinated the plane can be defined as p = [n1, n2, n3, -(n1*x1 + n2*x2 + n3*x3)]. Is there a short equation for finding the point where a line passes through a plane? Intuitively it feels as it should be x = l x p in homogeneous coordinates, but this computation does not exist, since there is no cross product in 4 dimensions. At the moment I am only able to compute the intersection by defining the line with the equation l (t) = a + b (t), where a is a point on the line and b is the direction of the line in Euclidean coordinates.

400296,One square per person,"There are n persons. Each person draws k interior-disjoint squares. I want to give each person a single square out of his chosen k, so that the n squares I give are interior-disjoint. What is the minimum k (as a function of n) for which I can do this? NOTES: For n=1, obviously k=1. For n=2, obviously k must be more than 2, since with 2 squares per person, it is easy to think of situations where both squares of person 1 intersect both squares or person 2. It seems that k=3 is enough, but I couldn't prove this formally. If we don't limit ourselves to squares, but allow general rectangles, then even for n=2, no k will be large enough, as it is possible that every rectangle of player 1 intersects every other rectangle of player 2. So, the sqauare limitation is important. EDIT: The problem has two versions: in one version, the squares are all axis-aligned. In the second version, the squares may be rotated. Solutions to any of these versions are welcome. EDIT: Here is a possibly useful claim, relevant for the axis-aligned version: Claim 1 : If two axis-aligned squares, A and B, intersect, then one of the following 3 options hold: At least 2 corners of A are covered by B, and B is as large or larger than A; One corner of A is covered by B, and one corner of B is covered by A, At least 2 corners of B are covered by A, and A is as large or larger than B.

400302,The derivative of a family of flows,"If one has a family of flows, can one describe the derivative in the ""family"" direction? Specifically, let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let
  $X_{s,t}$
be a 2-parameter family of fields on $M$. That is, it's a map
$$
\mathbb{R}^2 \to \Gamma(TM),
\qquad
(s,t) \mapsto X_{s,t}.
$$
This generates a 2-parameter family $\Phi_{s,t}$ of diffeomorphisms of $M$, but not uniquely. Let's choose one as follows:
$$
\Phi_{s,t}(x) = 
\text{the time $t$ flow of the $t$-dependent vector field $X_s(t)$}.
$$ So we have a map
$$
\Phi: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times M \to M,
\qquad
(s,t,x) \mapsto \Phi_{s,t}(x).
$$ Question: Is there a concrete way to write down the $s$ component of the derivative of $\Phi$? That is, is there a formula for $D \Phi(\partial_s)$ in terms of $X$? For instance, by definition, the $t$ component of the derivative is simply
$$
D\Phi|_{x,s,t}(\partial_t) = X_s(t).
$$ Some remarks: To be explicit, the map $\Phi$ is as follows: For each $s$, consider the $t$-family of vector fields $X_s(t)$. One can flow the manifold along this $t$-family, and the image of $x$ at time $t$ is $\Phi_{s,t}(x)$. 
(An inequivalent map would send $x$ to the time $s$ flow of the $s$-dependent vector field $X_t(s)$.) I believe $\Phi$ is smooth if one assumes that $X_{s,t}$ is smooth in both $s$ and $t$. (I don't know if the proof of the existence of solutions to ODEs guarantees regularity of families of flows.) This is probably either (a) a simple exercise with answers in terms of Lie derivatives and connections, or (b) unreasonable to ask. Regardless I haven't been able to write down any useful answer. Note there's a non-trivial $t$ dependence on $D\Phi(\partial_s)$. One can see this because at $t=0$, $D\Phi(\partial_s) = 0$, while for $t \neq 0$, the derivative is not zero on $\partial_s$. I haven't tried writing anything in terms of connections, as I didn't want to impose any metrics on the situation--clearly the answer is independent of any such choices--but I will certainly accept answers that impose a metric and write the answer in terms of the Levi-Civita connection. Here are some motivating examples: $f_s: M \to \mathbb{R}$ is a family of Morse functions, and you're curious how their time $t$ Morse flows are related. (Here, $\nabla f$ has no $t$-dependance.) Let $M$ be symplectic, and assume $H_{s,t}: M \to \mathbb{R}$ is a family of $t$-dependent Hamiltonians on $M$. Then one is interested in how the Hamiltonian flows of $H_{s,t}$ are related as one varies $s$.","['derivatives', 'differential-geometry', 'analysis']"

(Note: by Rademacher's theorem, the gradient $\nabla f(x)$ exists a.e.). An attempt of proof (please, check!). $\Rightarrow$ Differentiating the identity $f(\lambda x)=\lambda f(x)$ with respect to $\lambda$ at $\lambda=1$ , we obtain $f(x)$ in the right-hand side.
