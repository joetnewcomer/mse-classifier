1438868,"Y is $\sigma (X)$-measurable, show $Y=f(X)$ $f$ a Borel function","I am working on the following question for my probability theory class: Let $X, Y$ be random variables on $(\Omega,\mathcal{F}, P)$ such that $Y$ is $\sigma (X)$ -measurable. Show that there is a Borel-measurable function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ so that $Y=f(X)$ . My plan for this is the following. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the class of all random variables of the form $f(X)$ where $f$ is a Borel function. Let $\mathcal{A}=\sigma(X).$ I will then show that $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies (i), (ii) and (iii) below: (i) If $f,g\in\mathcal{M}, \ a,b\in\mathbb{R},$ then $af+bg\in\mathcal{M}$ . (ii) If $f_1\leq f_2 \leq f_3 \leq \dots$ is a sequence of functions in $\mathcal{M}$ and $f(\omega)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n(\omega)<\infty$ for each $\omega\in\Omega$ , then $f\in\mathcal{M}$ . (iii) $1_A \in \mathcal{M}$ for each $A\in \mathcal{A}.$ Once I show that $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies those three conditions by the Monotone Class Theorem I will have that $\mathcal{M}$ contains all $\sigma(\mathcal{A})=\mathcal{A}=\sigma(X)$ -measurable functions. So in particular $Y$ is in $\mathcal{M}$ . So far I believe I have figured out why $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies (i) and (ii). I believe (i) is satisfied because a constant multiple of a measurable function is measurable, and the sum of two measurable functions is measurable. I believe that (ii) is satisfied because the $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ of a sequence of measurable functions is measurable and in this case since the limit exists we have that the $\liminf$ would equal the $\limsup$ would equal the limit. Now what I am having trouble showing is that for each $A\in \sigma(X)=\mathcal{A}$ , $1_A\in\mathcal{M}$ Any help or comments would be appreciated!","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

How can I prove mathematically that for any such coloring, the board will always contain a subrectangle (paralell to the original one) whose four corners are the same color?

1439351,Intuition behind variational principle,"Hofer-Zehnder, in section 1.5, proves that every Hamiltonian field on a strictly convex compact regular energy surface carries a periodic orbit. I have understood the proof. What I am wondering about is how he gets the variational principles. The start of the proof finds a function $H$ having the given convex hypersurface as energy surface and satisfying positive homogeneity of degree two, positive definiteness of the Hessian, and $\mathcal{C}^2$ regularity. Then the proof normalizes the period to get period $2\pi$, and then it goes: For example, the variational principle: $$\min\int_0^{2\pi}H\big(x(t)\big)\,dt\quad{\rm under}\quad\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{2\pi}\langle Jx,\dot x\rangle=1.$$ […] has the above equations as Euler equations. Firstly, what are the Euler equations of a variational principle? And secondly, how did they get this particular principle? Update Let me make my question more precise. There are 3-4 points I have trouble with. Why do they consider this principle with this strange constraint of that integral being 2? I mean, it isn't even a vector space! It's perhaps not even an affine space, it has no particular properties. Why should this constraint be useful? And why that functional? How do I get the Euler equations for this principle, and what are they? If I try to say ""directional derivatives 0"", I get stuck at once, because how am I supposed to make the variation? The book then goes on, and says this functional attains neither the infimum, nor the supremum. How can one prove these claims? The book then Legendre transforms $H$ into $G$, gives properties of $G$, and introduces the same principle on $G$: $$\min\int_0^{2\pi}G(\dot z)\,dt\quad{\rm under}\quad\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{2\pi}\langle Jz,\dot z\rangle=1.$$ Again, why should I consider this particular principle, with this particular constraint? I mean, I understood the rest of the proof so I know this is the right principle to consider, but how was it come up with?

Is there an easier way to prove that if $x_n\leq y_n$ for all $n$, then $\lim_{n\to\infty }x_n\leq \lim_{n\to\infty }y_n$ ? This is how I do: Let $\ell=\lim_{n\to\infty }x_n$ and $\ell'=\lim_{n\to\infty }y_n$. Suppose $\ell'<\ell$. Let $\varepsilon=\frac{\ell-\ell'}{2}$. In particular, there is a $N$ such that $y_N\in]\ell'-\varepsilon,\ell'+\varepsilon[$ and $x_N\in]\ell-\varepsilon,\ell+\varepsilon[$ and thus $y_N<x_N$ which is a contradiction with the fact that $x_n\leq y_n$ for all $n$.

1439639,Initial and Final Objects in a Category,"I understand the definition of initial and final objects in a category: that an object $\frak{I}$ is initial in a category $\frak{C}$ if for every other object in $\frak{C}$ (we'll just call it $\frak{O}$), there is a unique morphism $\frak{I} \rightarrow \frak{O}$. Similarly for final objects with the arrow reversed - there should be a unique morphism from that object to the final object. My question is a little bit vague. In some sense, I want to understand how knowledge of the initial and final objects in a set help you unravel the content of the category in some way. For example, In $\frak{Set}$, the only initial object is $\emptyset$, and the final objects are all the singletons. On the other hand, in $\frak{Grp}$, the trivial group $\{e\}$ is both initial $and$ final. The proof of these claims is pretty trivial. However, I expect that this should help me to understand exactly what makes these categories (and their objects) different. In this case, the difference arises from the requirement that the morphisms in $\frak{Grp}$ must preserve identities. How can I go about understanding these differences in other categories? What is the general principle at work when parsing language involving initial and final objects in general? That is to say, what mathematical content do these objects contain?","['abstract-algebra', 'intuition', 'category-theory']"

Is it possible for $f$ to assume each value in its range an even number of times? To clarify, some values might be taken 0 times, some 2, some 4, etc., but always an even (and therefore finite) number.
I don't require that there be a value that is assumed any particular number of times. 
For example, the function might be surjective, or never take on any value exactly twice. This question is possibly the same as A continuous function cannot take every value an exact even number of times? .

The total cardinality is the same counting in the horizontal or vertical direction first, so I can't think of an easy reason why such an $S$ would not exist. $S$ necessarily has outer (Lebesgue) measure $1$ and inner (Lebesgue) measure $0$.

$$
B_{n,k}^{(g \diamond f)^c}(x) = \sum_{l=1}^{n-1} {n \choose l} B_{n-l,c}^f(x)B_{l,k-c}^g(x)
$$ My Observations: I have no formal education in techniques for proving these kinds of expressions, but I will share what I have observed: By setting 
$$m_1 = c$$
$$m_2 = k-c$$
$$w = k -j$$
We can see (disregarding the summations) that the expressions are exactly the same. This is what I mean: $$
\sum_{c=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=c+1}^{n} \sum_j {c \choose j} \frac{(k-c)!}{(k-c-j)!} f^{k-c-j} g^{c-j} \Phi(n,k,c) =

$$ \sum_{k-j=1}^n \sum_{c=1}^{k-j} \sum_{k-c = 1}^{k-j}\frac{c!(k-c)!}{j!(k-c-j)!(c-j)!}f^{k-c-j}g^{c-j} \sum_{l=1}^{n-1} {n \choose l} \rho(l,c,f) \rho(n-l,k-c,g)
$$
Where as stated previously, the summations do not even make sense, but the terms inside the summations are identical. Not sure if this helps but it is interesting and it is something I observed.
We can also see that in order for the terms to be non-zero the following inequality must be true:
$$
m_1+m_2 \ge w
$$
This is because of the coefficients:
$$
\frac{m_1!m_2!}{(w-m_1)!(w-m_2)!(m_1+m_2-w)!}
$$
Lets assume that $m_1+m_2 \le w$, then we have $m_1+m_2 - w = -I$ where $-I$ is a negative whole number, therefore the coefficient would be $0$ by taking a negative factorial of an integer:
$$
\frac{m_1!m_2!}{(w-m_1)!(w-m_2)!(-I)!} = \frac{m_1!m_2!}{(w-m_1)!(w-m_2)!} \frac{1}{\pm \infty} = 0
$$

we get as a possible solution a summation showing ratios of differences of various gamma functions: $I(\alpha, m,n)=e^{\alpha (1- n)} (\alpha  (n-1))^{n-1} $ $$\sum _{i=0}^{n-1} (-1)^i \binom{n-1}{i}\frac{ \left(\frac{1}{\alpha -\alpha  n}\right)^{i-m} (\Gamma (i-m+1,\alpha -n \alpha )-\Gamma (i-m+1,-(n-1) \alpha  \epsilon ))}{\Gamma (n)-\Gamma \left(n,\frac{(n-1) \alpha }{\epsilon +1}\right)}$$ Now the hitch. I am computing (for control) the expression of $I(\alpha,m, n)$ integral using high precision  numerical integration. With n=10, the numerical integration matches the gamma function. Beyond, it, the gamma functions (using Wolfram's Mathematica) produce different results (and from familiarity with the problem, I know that the gamma is wrong compared to the numerical).  Yet I need $n$ around $10^4$. Further, other special functions such as the exponential integral give even worse results. The results are in the attached picture. With $\epsilon=\frac{1}{100}$,  $I(\frac{3}{2},1,n)$: The questions are: 1) Is there a possible closed form for $I$not entailing special functions? 2) Is there a better way to solve the integral by avoiding the summation?

1440239,What are $F$-structures all about?,"This is a pretty open ended question.  I'm reading Springer's book on algebraic groups and am very confused about these ""$F$-structures.""  If $k$ is an algebraically closed field, and $A$ is an affine $k$-algebra, we can put a topology on the set $S$ of maximal ideals of $A$, or equivalently the set of $k$-algebra homomorphisms $A \rightarrow k$,  and make this topological space into a ringed space.  This ringed space will be isomorphic to the ringed space of regular functions of a closed subset of $k^n$ in the Zariski topology, for some $n \geq 0$. Now let $F$ be a subfield of $k$.  A finitely generated $F$-subalgebra $A_0$ is said to be defined over $S$ if the obvious $k$-vector space homomorphism $k \otimes_F A_0 \rightarrow A$ is an isomorphism.  Then the $F$-rational points is the set of $F$-algebra homomorphisms $A_0 \rightarrow F$. 1 .  What is this homomorphism $k \otimes_F A_0 \rightarrow A$ normally?  Is it always injective? That is, can I identify the tensor product $k \otimes_F A_0$ with the span of $A_0$ in $A$ as a $k$-vector space? 2 .  What is the significance of the $F$-rational points?  Is there a topology we can place on it, or a ringed space structure? 3 .  To what extent can we discuss subfields $F$ of $k$ and their $F$-structures, or resulting topological spaces, while avoiding noncanonical or arbitrary measures?  For example, I prefer to associate to an affine $k$-algebra the ringed space of maximal ideals of $A$, because I can define this topology without reference to a set of generators $x_1, ... , x_n$ of $A$, i.e. the results clearly don't depend on the choice of a closed subset $V$ of the Zariski topology in $k^n$ such that $A \cong k[X_1, ... , X_n]/I(V)$. 4 .

I'm new in probability so I'm still not secure of how I should use the classical distributions to model problems. My problem is the following: I have a success-failure experiment such that the probability of success is $p\in(0,1)$ ($p$ is supposed to be very little, but this shouldn't change the reasoning). If we run the experiment one time, the probability of success is $p$. If we run the experiment $n$ times, the probability of having $k$ successes is $\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$, for $0\leq k\leq n$. This is modeled by the binomial distribution. What I want to know is an inverse problem, we can say. How many experiments we should run to have one success with probability at least $50\%$? I'm looking for the minimal number $n$ of experiments. My idea: We can keep $n$ unknown and ask for the probability of having at least one success in $n$ experiments. This is given by $\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$. It's possible to use some program to find the minimum $n$ such that $\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\geq \frac{1}{2}$. In fact, I did this for some values of $p$, in particular, for $p=\frac{1}{10000}$ we have $n=6932$. But I'm not sure of this argument.

So essentially we want to find a hole of $U$ and translate that hole to the origin (at least, this is the approach that comes to me). If we could find a Jordan curve lying inside $U$ which is homotopically nontrivial, I believe we could do the following: this Jordan curve bounds a (topological) disk. Clearly $U$ cannot contain all points in this disk or else the curve would be homotopically trivial. So take a point in the disk but not in $U$ and consider the translation which sends it to the origin; I believe that should induce something nontrivial on $\pi_1$. However, I'm not sure if we can always find this Jordan curve.

We define adjoint representation $\operatorname{Ad}: G \to \operatorname{Aut} \mathfrak g$ by differentiating $c_g$ at identity, $\operatorname{Ad}(g) = c_{g*}$ . We differentiate once more at identity to obtain $\operatorname{ad}: \mathfrak g \to \operatorname{End}(\mathfrak g)$ , $\operatorname{ad} = \operatorname{Ad}_{*}$ .
Then, Lie bracket on $\mathfrak g$ is defined as $[X, Y] = \operatorname{ad}(X)(Y)$ . In the second book, we first define Lie bracket on smooth vector fields and left-invariant vector fields on $G$ (these are vector fields invariant to differential of left multiplication by $g$ , for every $g$ in $G$ ). Next, we notice that vector space of left-invariant vector fields is Lie bracket-closed and isomorphic to $\mathfrak g$ .
Lie bracket on $\mathfrak g$ is transported from Lie bracket on left-invariant vector fields by that isomorphism.","['lie-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'lie-algebras']"
1440740,"Proof for $A,B \in M_n(\mathbb{F})$ that if $[A,B]=tA$ for $0\neq t\in\mathbb{F}$, then $A^n=0$ [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : If $A$ and $AB-BA$ commute, show that $AB-BA$ is nilpotent [duplicate] (2 answers) Closed 8 years ago . Statement. Suppose we have a square matrices $A,B$ of order $n$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristics $0$ or $p>n$. If $[A,B]=AB-BA=tA$ for some nonzero $t\in\mathbb{F}$, then $A^n=0$. The problem is to prove this statement. Where I've got so far. There is an idea to take trace of both sides of equation:
$$
\mathrm{tr}\,(AB-BA)=\mathrm{tr}\,(tA)
$$
$$
\mathrm{tr}\,(AB)-\mathrm{tr}\,(BA)=t\times\mathrm{tr}\,(A)
$$
since $\mathrm{tr}\,(AB) = \mathrm{tr}\,(BA)$ (by properties of the trace) we have
$$
t\times A = \mathrm{tr}\,(A)
$$
and since $t\neq 0$, we have $\mathrm{tr}\,(A) = 0$. That's all I could get form it. What sould I do next?","['matrices', 'abstract-algebra', 'nilpotence', 'symmetric-polynomials', 'linear-algebra']"

1440797,"Solving a complex, sparse, linear system using the Schur complement","Solution method I am repetitively solving sparse linear systems (for the need of ARNOLDI iterations) of the type:
$$\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
J_1 & J_2 \\
J_3 & J_4
\end{bmatrix}}_J
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}}_z=
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
b_x \\
b_y
\end{bmatrix}}_b$$ I build the Schur-complement ($J_4$ is non-singular):
$$J_D=J_1-J_2J_4^{-1}J_3$$
Then, I solve for $x$:
$$J_Dx=b_x-J_2J_4^{-1}b_y$$
and then for $y$:
$$J_4y=b_y-J_3x$$ At this point I have a full solution of $z$. Intermediate calculations To calculate $J_2J_4^{-1}J_3$, I first compute $\tilde{J_2}=J_2J_4^{-1}$ as follows:
$$\tilde{J_2}^T=(J_2J_4^{-1})^T=(J_4^{-1})^TJ_2^T$$
Thus, I get $\tilde{J_2}$ by solving the system:
$$J_4^T\tilde{J_2}^T=J_2^T$$
and tacking the transpose. Edit: The above is implemented in Matlab and I use the conjugate transpose ' (mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ctranspose.html) for both the real and the complex. Also I use dot (mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/dot.html) for the dot products. Problem This way of solving works perfectly when $J$ is real (even if $b$ is complex). That is, solving $Jz=b$ directly or by building the Schur-complement gives the same $z$ as expected. However, when $J_4$ becomes complex, then I get different results...
I suspect that I did something really wrong when taking the transpose for $\tilde{J_2}$ or doing the dot product for $J_2J_4^{-1}b_y$. Yet, I fail to detect my error. Note: The reason I solve using the Schur-complement is that matrices $J_2,J_3,J_4$ have some particular structures that allow for good parallelization of the operations involved. E.g. $J_4$ is block diagonal and non-singular.","['schur-complement', 'numerical-linear-algebra', 'matrices', 'sparse-matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
1440798,Proving a lemma concerning the cardinality of two sets,"I'm currently doing my homework, and in order to facilitate all of the exercises, I decided to prove the following lemma: Assume that $E$ and $F$ are two finite sets and $f$ is a function from $E$ to $F$. Then: $f$ injective $\implies |E|\le|F|$ $f$ surjective $\implies |E|\ge|F|$ My prove goes as follows: Let $|E|=n$ and $E=\{e_1,...,e_n\}$ and define $G=\{f(e_1),...,f(e_n)\}$. If $f$ is injective, then $f(e_1),...,f(e_n)$ are all different, so $|G|=n$. But $G$ is a subset of $F$, thus $|E|=n=|G|\le|F|$. If $f$ is surjective, then $G=F$. But $G$ contains at most $n$ different elements, thus $|E|=n\ge|G|=|F|$. Is this prove precise enough? I have a few doubts concerning it, because the proofs of my colleagues are all quite tedious.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"
1440888,An identity involving matrix norm and vector norm in relation to a density matrix in physics,"This question is self-contained. For those who are interested, it arises from my study of the paper: K Lendi (1987), Evolution matrix in a coherence vector formulation for quantum Markovian master equations of N-level systems , J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. , 20(1): 15-23. The question is about the squared Frobenius norm $\|\rho\|_F^2=\operatorname{Tr}(\rho^2)$ (see formula 2.32 in the paper) of a self-adjoint ""density matrix"" in physics. This density matrix has a representation
$$
\rho = \frac{1}{N} \operatorname{id} + \sum_{k=1}^{N^2-1} v_k F_k \tag{2.16}
$$
where the matrices $F_i$ form an orthonormal basis of the space of traceless Hermitian matrices. It follows that $v_i=\operatorname{Tr}(\rho F_i)$. Now consider the squared Euclidean norm $\|v\|_2^2 = \sum_{k=1}^{N^2-1} v_k^2$ (2.33). I want to know why $\|\rho\|_F^2 = \frac{1}{N} + \|v\|_2^2$ holds.","['normed-spaces', 'linear-algebra', 'mathematical-physics', 'matrices']"
