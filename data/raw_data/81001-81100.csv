1051346,Optimal unbiased estimator,"I have the sample $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ of i.i.d. from $U(\theta - 1/2; \theta +1/2)$ .
It is well known that $T = (X_{(1)}; X_{(n)})$ is a sufficient but not complete statistic, because $X_{(n)}-X_{(1)} - (n-1)/(n+1)$ is unbiased estimator of zero. I want to find unbiased estimator of $\theta$ with minimal variance. I have crude unbiased estimator of $\theta$ : $$\hat {\theta} = X_1.$$ From Blackwell-Rao-Kolmogorov theorem estimator $$\hat {\theta}_1 = E\left[X_1\mid X_{(1)} = t_1; X_{(n)} = t_2\right] = \frac{t_1 + t_2}{2}$$ is unbiased and uniformly better than $\hat {\theta} = X_1$ . But because of non-completeless of $T = (X_{(1)}; X_{(n)})$ , this is not the only unbiased estimator as the function of $T$ . Moreover if I iterate the Blackwell-Rao-Kolmogorov theorem with this new estimator $\hat {\theta}_1 =\frac{t_1 + t_2}{2}$ I don't improve it: $$E\left[\frac {X_{(1)} + X_{(n)}}{2}\mid X_{(1)} = t_1; X_{(n)} = t_2\right] = \frac{t_1 + t_2}{2} = \hat {\theta}_1.$$ Is the $\frac {X_{(1)} + X_{(n)}}{2}$ the optimal unbiased estimator of $\theta$ (but not unique)?","['statistics', 'uniform-distribution', 'statistical-inference', 'parameter-estimation']"

1051410,Proving translational invariance of Lebesgue integral,"I am asked to show that the Lebesgue integral is invariant under translations. Specifically, Let $(\mathbb{R}, \Sigma, \mu)$ be a measure space, and for any $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ define $f_a:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ by $f_a(x)=f(x-a)$, for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$. Assume that the measure $\mu$ is such that $\mu(A)=\mu(A+a)$, where $A+a=\{x+a:x\in A\}$, for $A\in\Sigma$ and $a\in\mathbb{R}$. Assume also that $A+a\in\Sigma$ for any $A\in\Sigma$ and $a\in\mathbb{R}$. Let $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow[0,\infty]$ be a simple, measurable function, $f=\sum_{j=1}^m f_j$, with $f_j=a_j\chi_{A_j}$, $a_j\ge0$ and $A_j\in\Sigma$ for all $1\le j \le m$. The sets $A_j$ are pairwise disjoint. Show that \begin{align} \int_{\mathbb{R}}f\, \mathrm{d}\mu = \int_{\mathbb{R}}f_a\,\mathrm{d}\mu.\end{align} Show that this also holds for any measurable $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow[0,\infty]$. Now, I have attempted to solve the first part by writing $f_a$ as 
\begin{align}
f_a(x) = f(x-a) &= \sum_{j=1}^m f_j(x-a) = \sum_{j=1}^m a_j\chi_{A_j}(x-a) = \sum_{j=1}^m a_j\chi_{A_j+a}(x),

and then computing 
\begin{align}
\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x) &= \int_{\mathbb{R}}\sum_{j=1}^m f_j(x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x)\\
&= \sum_{j=1}^m a_j\mu(A_j) = \sum_{j=1}^m a_j\mu(A_j+a) \\
&= \int_{\mathbb{R}}\sum_{j=1}^m f_{j,a}(x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}}f_a(x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x),

using the fact that $\mu(A_j)=\mu(A_j+a)$. Now, does this make sense? Also, in order to generalize to arbitrary measurable, positive $f$, can I just use the fact that any measurable function is the pointwise limit of a sequence of simple functions, and apply the monotone convergence theorem?

1051611,Mean value theorem and the axiom of choice,"There's this theorem in Spivak's book of Calculus : Theorem 7 Suppose that $f$ is continuous at $a$, and that $f'(x)$ exists for all $x$ in some interval containing $a$, except perhaps for $x=a$. Suppose, moreover, that $\lim_{x \to a} f'(x)$ exists. Then $f'(a)$ also exists, and 
  $$f'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} f'(x)$$ Proof By definition,
  $$f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$
  For sufficiently small $h>0$ the function $f$ will be continuous on $[a,a+h]$ and differentiable on $(a,a+h)$ (a similar assertion holds for sufficiently small $h<0$). By the Mean Value Theorem there is a number $\alpha_h$ in $(a,a+h)$ such that
  $$\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = f'(\alpha_h)$$
  Now $\alpha_h$ approaches $a$ as $h$ approaches $0$, because $\alpha_h$ is in $(a,a+h)$; since $\lim_{x \to a} f'(x)$ exists, it follows that
  $$f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} f'(\alpha_h) = \lim_{x \to a} f'(x)$$
  (It is a good idea to supply a rigorous $\epsilon$-$\delta$ argument for this final step, which we have treated somewhat informally.) $\blacksquare$ Following the recommendation of supplying the details I had the question of $\alpha_h$ being a choice function. This is because for every $h$ there is the possibility of having a lot of points $c$ such that $f'(c)=\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$. Then we choose one of them to have a function $\alpha_h$. I'm not sure though because I'm always struggling with the axiom of choice that I cannot distinguish if it's needed or not. Also maybe in this case what the author is saying is something different.

Now let $$\phi:\ell^1\to c^*,\quad \phi(g)=T_g.$$ Show that $\phi$ is an isometry and determine whether $\phi$ is an isomorphism. First I showed that $\phi$ is an isometry. It is trivial that $\phi$ is linear, and it is bounded since $$\Vert T_g\Vert\leq\Vert g\Vert_1.$$ On the other hand, since $g\in\ell^1$, $\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{k=N}^{\infty}|g(k)|=0$. So for each $N\in\mathbb{N}$, let $$f_N(k)=\begin{cases}\text{sgn}(g(k+1)),&k\leq N\\

It follows by triangle inequality that $$\Vert T_g(f_N)\Vert\geq\sum_{k=1}^{N+1}|g(k)|-\sum_{k=N+2}^\infty|g(k)|$$ Thus $$\Vert T_g\Vert\geq\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{N+1}|g(k)|=\Vert g\Vert_1$$ which means $\phi$ is an isometry.

However, in the textbook, we were given the following questions and the corresponding solutions: If $f$ is differentiable and $f(-1)=f(1),$ then there is a number $c$ such that $|c|<1$ and $f'(c)=0.$ (true) My solution: consider $f=\frac 1 {x^2}$, therefore it is false. If $f'(x)$ exists and is nonzero for all $x,$ then $f(1)\neq f(0).$ (true) My solution: consider $f=\frac 1 {(x-0.5)^2}$, therefore it is false.

1052237,Why are numeric methods the only technique available to solving $\ln(x) = \sin(x)$?

This is interesting in its own regard, but I am interested in why this is the case. Several questions immediately jump out at me: Is it really the case that there is no analytic expression that represents the solution? Are there general techniques one can use to prove this is the case for similar equations? Is there a connection between these types of solutions and transcendental numbers? Is $x$ a transcendental number? Are there additional complex solutions? Are they more easily expressed? I am not very familiar with complex analysis. For the purposes of this question, I will follow the wikipedia definition of an Analytic Expression. This allows the following constructions in the expression:
Constant, Variable, Elementary arithmetic operation, Factorial, Integer exponent, N-th root, Rational exponent, Irrational exponent, Logarithm, Trigonometric function, Inverse trigonometric function, Hyperbolic function, Inverse hyperbolic function, Gamma function
Bessel function, Special function, Continued fraction, Infinite series If it is more interesting, what about just a 'closed-form', which allows everything up to the Gamma function in the above list. EDIT:
I've attempted to use PARI to calculate the continued fraction without much luck. I used the command ""x = exp(sin(x))"", which returns a truncated power series. I can't really find anything in the documentation for how to get this as a continued fraction; simply doing ""contfrac(x)"" just returns the power series again inside of some square brackets. Even if I could get it to display a continued fraction, it seems that PARI is resorting to a numerical method to calculate an approximate value and then displaying this approximate value in different representations. I believe this means the continued fraction series in not simply a truncated version of the ""real"" (probably) infinite continued fraction, but the entire finite sequence representation of the approximate value. If this is the case, then I cannot look at the sequence to search for a pattern... Thus question 4. Is there a numerical method for generating the continued fraction?","['transcendental-numbers', 'calculus', 'analyticity']"
1052247,What is the magnitude of a dual number? I'm not finding information on this.,"I'm investigating dual quaternions and am having to learn a lot of stuff myself because I'm finding very few resources on the mathematical background. I know that the magnitude of a dual quaternion is a dual number.  This makes sense because it is a dual number with real quaternions jammed into its real components.  Alternately, it is a quaternion with dual numbers jammed into its real components.  Both approaches yield the same form. Question: But what is magnitude of a dual number?  Does that question even make sense? I know that the magnitude of a complex number is the root of sum of the squares of the real numbers.  Ditto for a real quaternion.  But the dual number operator epsilon (I'll abbreviate it as simply 'e') is not like the irrational unit numbers.  Square any of the irrational unit numbers and you get -1.  Square e and you get 0.  This makes the dual number completely useless as a rotor, but it still has use as a multi-part number.  I'm wondering if nature of this dual operator also makes it unsuitable to calculate its magnitude with the Pythagorean Theorem. Again, the magnitude of a dual quaternion is a dual number, and it doesn't make sense to me to calculate the magnitude again just to get a pure real number, so I've postulated that the magnitude of a dual number is simply itself , like saying that the magnitude of the real number 5 is simply 5.  The magnitude of 1189 is 1189.  The magnitude of 35 + 14e is 35 + 14e. But I don't know how to prove this or if it is even right. Help?","['quaternions', 'abstract-algebra']"

Here is the exact question: Use a combinatorial argument to count the number of different six-card hands that can be dealt from r combined decks, for each positive integer r. I assumed that if r > 6 it would not effect the answer because at most a card can be repeated six times. Therefore, I interpreted the question as asking to use a combinatorial argument to count the number of different six-card hands that can be dealt from a sextuple deck. From that point I found eleven different situations that could occur represented by the following sequences: 123456, 112345, 112234, 112233, 111234, 111223, 111222, 111123, 111122, 111112, 11111.

$$\binom{52}{6}\binom{6}{0}+\binom{52}{5}\binom{5}{1}+\binom{52}{4}\binom{4}{2}+\binom{52}{3}\binom{3}{3}+\binom{52}{4}\binom{4}{1}+\binom{52}{3}\binom{3}{1}\binom{2}{1}+\binom{52}{2}\binom{2}{2}+\binom{52}{3}\binom{3}{1}+\binom{52}{2}\binom{2}{1}\binom{1}{1}+\binom{52}{2}\binom{2}{1}+\binom{52}{1}\binom{1}{1},$$

(a) Prove that $I \subseteq R$ is prime if and only if $R/I$ is an integral domain. Proof. First note that the zero element of the ring $R/I$ is $0 + I = I$ and that $a + I = I$ if and only if $a \in I$. Now suppose that $I \subseteq R$ is a prime ideal and consider nonzero cosets $a + I$ and $b + I$ in $R/I$ (i.e. consider $a \not \in I$ and $b \not \in I$). Since $I$ is prime this implies that $ab \not \in I$, hence $ab + I \neq I$ and we conclude that $R/I$ is an integral domain. Conversely, let $R/I$ be an integral domain and consider $a, b \in R$ with $ab \in I$ (i.e. consider $ab + I = I$). Since $(a + I)(b + I) = ab + I = I$ and $R/I$ is an integral domain we conclude that either $a + I = I$ (i.e., $a \in I$) or $b + I = I$ (i.e., $b \in I$). Hence $I \subseteq R$ is a prime ideal.

1052411,Proof of Halphen's Theorem,"I am struggling with details of the proof of Halphen's Theorem in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry (chapter 4.6, Proposition 6.1, page 349). The statement of the theorem is: A curve $X$ of genus $g\geq 2$ has a nonspecial very ample divisor $D$ of degree $d$ iff $d\geq g+3$. By curve, I mean a complete, nonsingular curve over $k=\overline{k}$. (i.e. integral scheme of dimension 1, proper over $k$, all local rings are regular). I struggle with the second part of the proof. Given  $d\geq g+3$, Hartshorne
proves the existence of a nonspecial very ample divisor of degree $d$. In his proof he associates $X^{d}$ with divisors of the form
$D=P_{1}+\ldots+P_{d}$ where the $P_{i}$ are closed points. He then defines the set
 \begin{align*}
S=&\{D \in X^d\; | \;\exists \textrm{ divisor } D' \textrm{and points } P,Q: \\ 
&D \sim D', E=D'-P-Q \textrm{ is effective and special} \}
\end{align*}
 and discusses its dimension.
So, my first question: Does he refer to the subscheme associated to $\overline{S}$ with
the reduced induced structure? If not, how can the authore refer to the notion of the dimension of this set? He further notes that any effective special divisor is a subset of  an effective canonical divisor and since $\textrm{dim}_k |K|=g-1$, the set of all effective special divisors also has dimension at most $g-1$. My problem here is that I can not make this precise.
(I also struggle again with the fact that he talks about the dimension of the set).
If $E$ is an effective, special divisor, then there is an effective divisor $F$ such that
$K-E \sim F$ and thus $K\sim F+E$ and $F+E$ is effective. So we could define a map
$E \mapsto E+F$ and its injectivity would imply the bound of the dimension.
However, there might be multiple suitable $F$ (so a choice has to be made?) and the bound of the dimension only makes sense if the map respects some sort of structure. If anybody could clarify some of my confusions, I would be very thankful. I apologize for the long post, I wasn't able to shorten it. I would also appreciate the reference to another proof of this theorem.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

Instead, these lecture notes are about the classical ""Lights Out"" problem, but investigate the issue of minimization (Section 24.2.4).

Unfortunately the results weren't encouraging: despite the heroic speedup achieved by the answers to this question , that algorithm is too slow for $n > 6$.

A set is of first category if it is a countable union of nowhere dense sets. First Category Baire's Lemma: Let $(X, \rho)$ be a complete metric space and $\{U_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ a sequence of open dense sets in $X$. Then the set $\bigcap_{n =1}^{\infty} U_n$ is also dense. Note that A is nowhere dense iff $(\overline{A})^c$ is open and dense. Suppose $\forall A$, $A$ is first category. That is, $A$ is a countable union of nowhere dense sets. i.e., $A_i$ is nowhere dense. $\forall A, \; A = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}A_i \implies (A)^c = \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}}(A_{i})^{c}$. But we don't know if this is a countable dense set! We know that $(\overline{A}_i)^c$ would be, but not just $(A)^c$. If $A$ is nowhere dense, what can we say about the compliment of $A$? Can anyone clear this up or provide advice? More scratch work: In my proposed proof, I said let all $A \subset S$ be of first category. i.e., each $A_i$ is nowhere dense, i.e, $(\overline{A}_i)^c$ is open and dense. So, $\forall A, (\overline{A}_i)^c = \bigcup (\overline{A}_i)^c \implies ((\overline{A}_i)^c)^c = \bigcap (((\overline{A}_i)^c)^c) = \bigcap (\overline{A}_i)$.

I am trying to prove this from elementary principles, so no referring to counting measures and deriving the result as an appendage of more general versions of the Riesz Representation Theorem. I do, however, have the RRT for $L^p$ at my disposal, but I can't make heads or tails of trying to extend an arbitrary functional on $\ell^p$ to one on $L^p$. My approach is, then, to force the theorem by defining $g=\sum T(e_n)$ where $e_n$ is the sequence (in $L^p$) with a $1$ in the $n$th place and zero otherwise. Then if $f=\sum a_k e_n$, $$T(f)=\sum a_k T(e_n)$$ by linearity, and this is bounded as $T$ is bounded. Hence for all $f \in \ell^p$,

And lets say that $\{f^k\}\rightarrow f$, now since the borel measurable functions is closed under pointwise limits, f has to be borel-measurable. But we haven't shown that it is a limit of continuous functions. Can such an f exist that is not a limit of continuous functions?

1052744,Development of measure and probability theory,"I am interested in a reference (article, maybe a book chapter) on the development of mathematical probability theory - that is, mostly starting from the beginning of the 20th century. It is surprising and fascinating to me that e.g. Wiener and Levy were able to develop theory of stochastic processes without using axiomatic probability theory. Similarly, I do remember seeing here on MO an article emphasizing that Kolmogorov's role in axiomatization of probability is usually overstated, whereas his job was mostly synthesis and the core ideas were developed by others. I have recently read the paper by Shafer and Vovk ""The origins and legacy of Kolmogorov’s Grundbegriffe"" which more or less covers the topic until late 1930s. That is quite close to the reference I am looking for, however it does not say much about what happened after the Kolmogorov's book was published. I have also tried reading Meyer's ""Stochastic Processes from 1950 to present"" , however it is rather different from the first reference in focusing more on short reviews of specialized topics in theory of stochastic processes developed in 1950-2000, rather than discussing what were the important problems, how different people tried approaching them, which conflict of ideas were there, and why and how the ideas that are now in textbooks won over others (which is the scope of the first reference). In particular, Meyer just shortly comments on the definition of continuous-time stochastic processes: Doob found the Kolmogorov's existence theorem insufficient for his purposes as product $\sigma$-algebra was too scarce, and came up with something different, without giving the details of how it happened and what was the line of reasoning of Doob and others that time. On a related note, although the first reference covers contributions of Borel and Lebesgue to abstract measure theory, as much as that of others (Caratheodory, Radon etc.), it does it mostly from the point of view of importance for Kolmogorov's axiomatization of probability. I'm thus interested in finding a similar account for the history of measure theory until the moment it was used in probability, and how was it affected in a feedback from probability after Kolmogorov, Doob and others started using it to solve probabilistic problems. I would also appreciated an advice whether to leave this question here, or move it to MO.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory', 'math-history']"

For a measurable space $(A, \mathscr{A})$ and $B \subseteq A$ denote $\mathscr{A}|B$ as the trace $\sigma$-algebra on $B$.

Consider the measurable product space $E^{[0, 1]}$ equipped with the product $\sigma$-algebra $\mathscr{E}^{\otimes [0,1]}$. The space $C := C([0, 1], E)$ of continuous functions with the topology given by the uniform convergence is Polish.  It is a subset of $E^{[0,1]}$ but is not contained in $\mathscr{E}^{\otimes [0,1]}$. However, $\mathscr{E}^{\otimes [0,1]} | C = \mathscr{B}(C)$. The Skorokhod space $D := D([0, 1], E)$ of cadlag functions is also Polish. It is a subset of $E^{[0,1]}$ but is also not contained in $\mathscr{E}^{\otimes [0,1]}$.

By the way the definition of $S(x)=x\cup \{x\}$ My reason for not writing what I have so far is that it's tonnes of $\{$ and $\}$","['natural-numbers', 'elementary-set-theory']"
1053094,Determinig whether a complicated series has a limit - is there any other way to do it?,"Here's a series the limit of which I want to evaluate: $$a_n=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(1+\frac{1}{n})^nn^2-7n}{n^3+3n^2+1}$$ Here's how I did  it. Let's define 3 sequences: $b_n=\frac{n^2-7n}{n^3+3n^2+n}$, $c_n=\frac{n-\frac{n}{2}}{n^2+4n}$, $d_n=\frac{2}{3n}$ We have $\sum d_n=\frac{2}{3}\sum\frac{1}{n}$ and as $\sum\frac{1}{n}$ is divergent, $\sum d_n$ is also divergent. So if we prove that for sufficiently large n $d_n \leq c_n$, same for $c_n \leq b_n$ and finally same for $b_n \leq a_n$ then by comparison test we will prove, that $\sum a_n$ is divergent. So let's do this now. $\sum c_n=\sum\frac{1}{2(n+4)}=\frac{1}{2}\sum\frac{1}{n+4}$ Now let $e_n=\frac{1}{n+4}$. For sufficiently large n we have $\frac{1}{n+\frac{n}{2}}=\frac{2}{3n}=d_n\leq e_n$. So, by comparison test $\sum e_n$ divergent, so that means $\sum c_n$ is also divergent. $c_n \leq b_n$ because $\frac{n-\frac{n}{2}}{n^2+3n+n} \leq \frac{n-7}{n^2+3n+1}=\frac{n^2-7n}{n^3+3n^2+n}$and $b_n \leq a_n$ is obvious. So this is it, now we've proven that $\sum a_n$ is divergent. The problem is it took a while and I'm not sure whether my solution is correct. Are there other, simpler ways to solve this problem? Preferably without derivatives and integrals - I haven't covered them in my course yet.","['sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification', 'limits']"
