1297396,Intuition behind variance in terms of $L^P$ norms?,"I've just started working through Varadhan's Probability lecture notes, and I was wondering if there's any intuitive connection between the variance formula and Holder's inequality/ $L^p$ norms in general. In a sense, for a probability space $(\Omega, \cal B, P)$ with $P(\Omega) = 1$ and a random variable  $X\in L^2(\Omega)$, then if $X\geq 0$ we can write: $E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = (\int X(w)^2 dP) - (\int X(w) dP)^2 = \vert\vert X \vert\vert^2_{L^2(\Omega)} - \vert\vert X^{\frac{1}{2}} \vert\vert^4_{L^{2}(\Omega)}\geq 0 $ Is there any way to think of variance in terms of the $L^p$ norms?

Let 
\begin{equation*}
X = Z(x_1x_2,x_1x_3,x_2x_3) \subseteq \mathbb{P}^3.

I guess that $dim(X)=1$, since the coordinate $x_0$ is free. I showed that if $X$ is a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$, then $g(X)=\binom{d-1}{n}$. I don't think that this can be applied to this problem but it's a general result that I know. I showed also that if $X$ is a complete intersection of two surfaces of degree $a$ and $b$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$, then $g(X)=\frac{1}{2}ab(a+b-4)+1$. Is there any solution of this problem that does not involve computing the Hilbert polynomial of $X$? However, if computing the Hilbert polynomial is simplier, that's ok for me.

1297435,Does every continuous map between compact metrizable spaces lift to the Cantor set?,"I'm interested in the universal properties of the Cantor set. It is well-know that the Cantor set $2^\mathbb{N}$ is ""universal"" in the category of metrizable compact spaces, in the sense that every compact metrizable space is a quotient of $2^\mathbb{N}$ (although the quotient map is not unique). My main question is: Does every continuous map $f:K_1\to K_2$ between compact metrizable spaces lift to a continuous map of the Cantor space (together with some quotient maps)? If so, what else can we say about such a lift? For example, if $f$ is a homeomorphism, can we lift it to a homeomorphism of the Cantor set? What about group actions: Does every action of a group on a compact metrizable space by homeomorphisms lift to an action on the Cantor set (with a quotient map)?","['cantor-set', 'universal-property', 'general-topology']"

1297528,How to find the Galois group of a given polynomial from Galois viewpoint?,"Excerpt from Page 3 Consider the polynomial equation
  \begin{equation*}
  x^4 - 2 = 0,
\end{equation*}
  with integer coefficients. We have four solutions:
  \begin{equation*}
  \alpha = \sqrt[4]{2},\quad 
  \beta = i \sqrt[4]{2},\quad
  \gamma = -\sqrt[4]{2},\quad
  \delta = -i \sqrt[4]{2}, 
\end{equation*}
  Note that two of these solutions are not real. Now let us list some equations
  that these four roots satisfy:
  \begin{equation*}
  \alpha + \gamma = 0,\quad
  \alpha \beta \gamma \delta = -2,\quad
  \alpha \beta - \gamma \delta = 0, \dotsc
\end{equation*} What happens if we swap $ \alpha $ and $ \gamma $ in this list? We get
  \begin{equation*}
  \gamma + \alpha = 0, \quad
  \gamma \beta \alpha \delta = -2,\quad
  \gamma \beta - \alpha \delta = 0, \dotsc
\end{equation*}
  which are all still valid. Likewise we could permute the variables as follows
  \begin{equation*}
 \alpha \mapsto \beta \mapsto \gamma \mapsto \delta 
\end{equation*}
  You can check that the equations above remain valid. So, does any such
  permutation work? For any such equation? The answer is ""no"": try, for
  instance, swapping $ \beta $ and $ \gamma $,
  and you find that the first of the equations above becomes false. The set of permutations of the set $ \{\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta \} $
  that preserve the validity of all polynomial equations (with coefficients in 
  $ \mathbb{Q} $) in these variables is called the Galois group of the
  equation $ x^4 = 2 $. This group is the symmetric group of the square (which
  makes sense if you look at the location of $ \alpha, \beta, \gamma $, 
  and $ \delta $ in the Complex plane. It is also known as $ D_8 $,
  the dihedral group of order 8. Question 1 : In order to determine the permutations of the set $ \{ \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta \} $ that preserve the validity of all polynomial
equations (with coefficients in Q) in these variables, do I need to list out all such equations (how would I do it), and how do tell the list is exhaustive
and then only determine such permutations? Question 2 : Following Question 1, the coefficients of a polynomial form 
symmetric polynomials as functions of the roots. How this help in determining
the correct permutations? Using this as example, the Galois group is isomorphic
to the Klein 4-group: $ x^4 - 5x + 6 = 0 $ factorize
as $ (x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 2) = (x^2 - r_1 r_2)(x^2 - r_3 r_4) $
and the permutation that leave the polynomial unchanged is
the identity, $ (12), (34) $ and $ (12)(34) $. Other permutations turn it into different polynomials and do not belong the Galois group of the permutation? Question 3 : Am I correct to say that a permutation belongs to the Galois group of the polynomial if it permutes the roots in such a way that when we multiply out, we obtain the polynomial that we started with? Question 4 : How would Galois himself have determined the ""Galois group"" of a given polynomial? Question 5 : Could you please point out where I could find materials on
how Galois solved the insolvability of quintic using materials available during
his time, instead of the automorphism of splitting field approach?  My google
search has been unsatisfatory. The textbooks by Cox, Tignol, Rotman, Swallow are
not easy to me and do not have the discussions I am comfortable with.","['abstract-algebra', 'galois-theory']"
1297540,Finding the probability of time between two events for a poisson process,"If two events occur at a rate of 1.8 per hour on average, and this occurrence follows a poisson process, what is the probability that there is at least 1 hour between two events? My approach for this question is the following: $$\lambda = \frac{1}{E(x)} = \frac{1}{1.8} = 0.556$$ The probability of the time being under an hour (using the cumulative probability density for the poisson process): $$P(X<1) = 1-e^{-\lambda x} = 1-e^{-0.556(1)} = 0.4265$$ Therefore the probability of the time being above an hour would be: $$P(X\ge1) = 1-P(X<1) = 1-(1-e^{-0.556}) = e^{-0.556} = 0.573$$ The logic here seems obvious: The probability of a given wait time for independent events following a poisson process is determined by the exponential probability distribution $\lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ with $\lambda = 0.556$ (determined above), so the area under this density curve (the cumulative probability) is 1. Therefore, the probability of any time range would be the integral of this distribution function over the given time range. The integral from 0 to 1 is the probability of the time between events being under 1 hour, which is $0.4265$, and so the probability of the time between events being above 1 hour is $1-0.4265 = 0.573$. ...however, this is apparently not correct. The answer to this in the back of the book I am using is $0.1653$, and by the logic I've outlined above I am not seeing how. I am very much hoping my approach is proper and that the book is wrong, and am hoping someone can help me correct or confirm my logic.","['poisson-distribution', 'statistics']"

(3) I assume that $ \binom{n}{k} \in\mathbb N $ holds and prove $ \binom{n+1}{k}\in\mathbb N $. (4) I apply the known formula $ \binom{n+1}{k}=\binom{n}{k-1}+\binom{n}{k} $.

1297605,A tough limit problem involving $1/(\sin x - \sin a)$ and its generalization,Long back I had encountered the following problem in Hardy's Pure Mathematics (originally from the infamous Mathematical Tripos 1896 ): If $$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sin x - \sin a} - \frac{1}{(x - a)\cos a}$$ then show that $$\frac{d}{da}\{\lim_{x \to a}f(x)\} - \lim_{x \to a}f'(x) = \frac{3}{4}\sec^{3}a - \frac{5}{12}\sec a$$ I had solved it using Taylor series expansions and even then it involved good amount of calculation. I suppose applying L'Hospital would be even more arduous. On the other hand both the Taylor series and L'Hospital Rule are discussed later in Hardy's book suggesting that it could be solved via elementary techniques (i.e. using algebra of limits and Squeeze theorem and if needed one can use mean value theorem). Please let me know if such a solution is possible. Also I believe there might be a suitable generalization applicable to functions of type $$g(x) = \frac{1}{\phi(x) - \phi(a)} - \frac{1}{(x - a)\phi'(a)}$$ and perhaps the expression $$\frac{d}{da}\{\lim_{x \to a}g(x)\} - \lim_{x \to a}g'(x)$$ has some significance.

Prove that if its volume is $\dfrac{4}{3}\pi$ then $\mathcal{S} = \mathbf{S}^2$ . My hypothesis: If there is a surface $\mathcal{S}\neq \mathbf{S}^2$ but with the same surface area to volume ratio then there is a function $F(t,x):I\times \mathbf{S}^2\to \mathbb{R}^3$ so that: $$F(t,x_0) \text{ is continuous }\forall x_0\in\mathbf{S}^2$$ $$F(t_0,\mathbf{S}^2) \text{ is a simple closed surface }\forall t_0\in I$$ $$F(0,\mathbf{S}^2) = \mathbf{S}^2\qquad F(1,\mathbf{S}^2) = \mathcal{S}$$ $$F(0,\mathbf{S}^2) \cong F(t,\mathbf{S}^2)\qquad \forall t\in I$$ $$V(F(t,\mathbf{S}^2)) = \frac{4}{3}\pi\qquad A(F(t,\mathbf{S}^2)) = 4\pi\qquad \forall t\in I$$ Where $\cong$ refers to equivalence via a bijective function, and $V(X)$ and $A(X)$ are, respectively, the volume and surface area functions. In other words, there is some kind of continuous homeomorphism between both surfaces that conserves both volume and surface area. Then by using variation calculus we can prove that if a surface is ""almost"" a sphere, it has a higher $S/V$ , thus there cannot be such function $F$ and therefore there is no such surface $\mathcal{S}$ . Perhaps my hypothesis is false. Feel free to prove the statement without using it.","['differential-geometry', 'measure-theory']"

And I remembered that in fact, I had seen a few of these matrices in a Quantum Mechanics course, in the context of perturbation theory , where an Hamiltonian $\hat{H_0}=\text{diag}(a,a,c)$ was said to be degenerate as its eigenvalues were $\lambda=\left\{a,a,c\right\}$, but it was possible to lift the degeneracy by applying a perturbation $\hat{H_p}=\begin{pmatrix}0&b&0\\b&0&0\\0&0&0\end{pmatrix}$, leading to an overall Hamiltonian described by the matrix $M$ above, with distinct eigenvalues. But I digress. My question is: knowing the eigenvalues, can we build a corresponding matrix ? This question (or something close to it) has probably already been asked, but I'm not only interested in building one matrix from a set of eigenvalues, but all possible matrices . Going back to perturbation theory, my question is directly motivated by trying to find perturbation matrices $\hat{H_p}$ that do not modify the eigenvalues of the unperturbed system $\hat{H_0}$.

$$\hat{H}=\begin{pmatrix}a&0&b\\0&a&0\\0&0&c\end{pmatrix},\quad\hat{H_0}=\begin{pmatrix}a&0&0\\0&a&0\\0&0&c\end{pmatrix},\quad\hat{H_p}=\begin{pmatrix}0&0&b\\0&0&0\\0&0&0\end{pmatrix}$$

1298467,simulating a fair six with a four equal sector spinner,"Whist teaching basic probability I needed a group to use a fair four sector spinner but I'd none left. I gave them a die asking them to disregard 5,6 should they arise.  The problem got me thinking about what I could do if I needed a die and only had a spinner. I have tried to formulate some rules for the puzzle: You can relabel the spinner after a spin.  For example $1234$ means the four equally likely sectors were labelled $1,2,3$ and $4$. Similarly $1123$ means $2$ of the sectors were labelled $1$. It is ok to label $5$ and $6$ e.g. $3456$ You cannot choose a sector to ignore essentially reducing the spinner to three equally likely sectors. You can spin and re-label as many times as you like. Is it possible under these rules to simulate a fair six sided die with such a spinner? I have adopted a notation of writing the state of the spinner for each spin underneath each other. $$\begin{array}{c} 1122 \\ 3344 \\1123 \\1223 \\1233 \end{array}$$ The above example an attempt of mine. Let the outcomes of successive spinners be called a branch (thinking like a probability tree) The branch$ (1,4,2,2,3)$ represents the outcome of $1$ on the first spin $4$ on the second etc. I chose this labelling because there would be $2\times2\times3\times3\times3=108$ different branches and $108$ is divisible by $6$ I know the branches are not equally likely but I was hoping to assign sets of branches to the six outcomes of the die e.g. $\{(1,4,2,2,3),(1,3,2,2,1)...\} \mapsto 1$ So far Ive got lost because the tree diagram gets out of hand. I'm not sure this problem can be solved as no power of $4$ is divisible by $6$ This is the first problem I've invented by myself so I apologize if there is something I have overlooked that makes the problem trivial.

In essence, the difficulty seems to be in requiring that the $f_N$ be ""normalized"" as well as possess a dominating function.

It’s not surprising that in the internet it’s possible to find an introduction, but most of these documents don’t present everything and I am looking need research tools useful for a scientist. Unfortunately people at my university tend to be interested in analytical branches of maths, that’s why I’m posting here. It seems that p-adic numbers remain quite unknown – even when building $\mathbb R$, the completion of $\mathbb Q$ with respect to usual absolute value, one rarely mentions that it’s possible to define another norm and get another field in the process, namely $\mathbb Q_p$. In my opinion books are the best source of knowledge. I already skimmed through four texts: p-adic numbers by F. Gouvea, p-adic Numbers, Analysis and $\zeta$-Functions by N. Koblitz, p-adic Analysis by A. Robert and last, but not least, p-adic Analyisis and Mathematical Physics by Vladimirov, Volovich and Zelenov. The problem is that they aren’t quite compatible with each other. For example, Gouvea states that it’s hard to define an integral, Koblitz says that the p-adc integral should be the limit of Riemann sums:
$$\int f\mu = \lim_N \sum_{a + (p^N) \subset X} f(x_{a,N}) \mu(a+(p^N))$$ as $a$ ranges from $0$ to $p^N – 1$ and $\mu$ is a p-adic measure – a distribution whose values are bounded by some constant for compact-open $U \subset X$). Robert admits that the Volkenborn integral will be more suitable, the last book defines normalized Haar measure that is invariant  with respect to shifts and then develops the theory of integration in $\mathbb Q_p^n$. (I'm not sure if it's not similar to the point of view of Koblitz). I’m also interested in reading articles (recently I have found Does it really converge? and it is pretty interesting) or learning the main theorems (by now I have discovered four: Ostrowski’s about absolute values on $Q$, Strassman’s about zeroes of power series, Hensel’s lemma and Hasse-Minkowski theorem about local-global principle - what are more?). I’m not familiar with advanced algebraic number theory (what are the adeles?!) but don’t struggle with topology or algebra at undergraduate level. I would appreciate any recommendations for further hints how to gentle expand my knowledge. Final note: I'm aware of this question , but the answers aren't satisfying me: I don't speak French and dislike analysis. TL;DR: I'm looking for materials (books, articles) about $p$-adic numbers at nonelementary level (possibly) suitable for an undergraduate, something more challenging than (usually recommended) book by Gouvea.","['p-adic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'reference-request']"

1298682,Difficult Fourier transform exercise,"I am currently dealing with a problem in functional analysis where I want to show the following. Let $\phi_{k+1}(x):=\sqrt{2} \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} h(n) \phi_k(2x-n)$ and $\phi_0= \chi_{[0,1]},$
if we define $a_k(n):=\langle \phi_k(.),\phi_k(.-n) \rangle$ and take the operator $$P:L^2(\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow L^2(\mathbb{R})$$ such that $$P\hat{f}(\xi) = \frac{1}{2} \left( |\hat{h}(\frac{\xi}{2})|^2 \hat{f}(\frac{\xi}{2})+|\hat{h}(\frac{\xi}{2}+\pi)|^2 \hat{f}(\frac{\xi}{2}+\pi) \right) $$ then this one also satisfies $\hat{a}_{k+1}= P \hat{a}_k$. Here I give a few thoughts about this, but maybe they are just misleading and the exercise is much simpler:
Now I tried to show this, but somehow I could not get anywhere. $h$ is taken in such a way that $\hat{h} \in L^{\infty}$ where $\hat{h}(\xi):= \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} h(n)e^{-in \xi}$ and $\phi_{k+1},a_{k+1} \in L^2$ again. Otherwise, $h$ is arbitrary. Furthermore $\hat{a_{k}}:=\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \langle \phi(.),\phi(.-n)\rangle e^{-in \xi}.$ It is useful to see ( I guess) that $$\hat{\phi}_{k+1}(\xi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{h}(\frac{\xi}{2}) \phi_{k}(\frac{\xi}{2}) = \Pi_{i=1}^{k+1} \left( \frac{\hat{h}(2^{-p}\xi)}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \cdot \hat{\phi_0}(\frac{\xi}{2}).$$ Furthermore by Plancherel and the definition of the Fourier transform we get $\langle \phi(.), \phi(.-n) \rangle=  \langle \hat{\phi} , e^{-in(.)} \hat{\phi} \rangle  =\mathcal{F}(|\hat{\phi}|^2)(n).$ $\hat{a_{k+1}}(\xi) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \langle \phi_{k+1}(.), \phi_{k+1}(.-n) \rangle e^{-i n \xi}$ which can be rewritten using Plancherel in the inner-product as $$\hat{a_{k+1}}(\xi) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \langle |\hat{h}(\frac{.}{2})|^2 |\phi_{k}(\frac{.}{2})|^2 ,e^{-in(.)} \rangle e^{-i n \xi}$$ I guess these are all the simple calculations one would do, but somehow this got me nowhere. Probably you need to use that $\hat{\phi}_0(x) = \frac{i(1-e^{ix})}{x}.$ If anything is unclear, please let me know.","['fourier-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'fourier-series', 'analysis']"
1298709,Convergence of the integral of a product of functions.,"Let $\phi:\mathbb{R^n}\to\mathbb{R}$ be a Lebesgue-measurable function, with the property that for every $n$-dimensional cube $Q$ in $\mathbb{R^n}$, we have
$$
\left|\int_{Q}\phi(x)dx \right|\leq\frac{M m(Q)}{1+m(Q)}

$$
\lim_{k\to \infty}\int_{\mathbb{R^n}}\phi(kx)f(x)dx = 0 
$$ From the first inequality, if you assume that $\int_{\mathbb{R^n}}=\lim_{m(Q)\to \infty}\int_{Q}$ (is this even true?), you can do:
$$
\left|\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\phi(x)dx\right|=\lim_{m(Q)\to \infty}\left|\int_{Q}\phi(x)dx\right|\leq \lim_{m(Q)\to \infty}\frac{M m(Q)}{1+m(Q)}=M

1298752,Counting problem - verification please?,"A question we did in class asks: ""In how many ways can we put 4 girls and 4 boys on a row (so order matters) so that a certain girl and a certain boy are always seated next to each other, and no 2 people of the same gender are seated next to each other?"" Everyone says its $4*2*(3!)^2$ but I think it is $7*2*(3!)^2$.
Let's say the row begins with a girl from left to right, then we can move the boy and the girl along this row seven times. Either the girl is on position 1, 3, 5 or 7 and for positions 3, 5, and 7, the boy can be seated either to the left or right of her, so it's 7 possibilities. We take $(3!)^2$ because the boys and the girls can be exchanged among themselves in $3!$ ways each (whether they are seated on uneven or even spots is determined by whether the row starts with a boy or a girl). Multiply by 2 because the row can also start with a boy.
Is this correct?",['combinatorics']
1298774,Given a finite collection of disjoint subsets of $I$ must every ultrafilter on $I$ contain exactly one?,"The title pretty much contains the question, but here's some elaboration: The following is one of the first results one encounters while learning about Ultrafilters. Fact: If $\mathfrak{U}$ is an ultrafilter on an index set $I$, and $X\subset I$, then exactly one of $X$ and $I\backslash X$ is in $\mathfrak{U}$. Question: Can this be generalized to a collection $X_{1}, ... X_{n}$ of disjoint subsets of $I$ for any $n\geq 1$?  That is, if $\mathfrak{U}$ is an ultrafilter on $I$, then there is exactly one value of $j\in\{1,...,n\}$ such that $X_{j}\in \mathfrak{U}$? I haven't been able to find it in the literature anywhere or prove it myself (though I thought I did briefly) so I'm beginning to suspect it's false in general. Second Question: If the answer to the first question is false, is it true if $\mathfrak{U}$ is an ultrafilter on $\mathbb{N}$ containing the order filter?","['elementary-set-theory', 'filters']"
1298780,Calculate $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{3x} - 1}{e^{4x} - 1}$,"Question: Calculate $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{3x} - 1}{e^{4x} - 1}$$ using substitution, cancellation, factoring etc. and common standard limits (i.e. not by L'Hôpital's rule). Attempted solution: It is not possible to solve by evaluating it directly, since it leads to a ""$\frac{0}{0}$"" situation. These kinds of problems are typically solved by cancellation and/or direct application of a after some artful substitution in a precalculus context. It was a bit hard to find a good substitution, so I tried several: $t = 3x$ $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{3x} - 1}{e^{4x} - 1} = \{t=3x\} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{t} - 1}{e^{4\frac{t}{3}} - 1}$$ Although this gets me closer to the standard limit $$\lim_{x to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1$$ ...it is not good enough. $t = e^{4x} - 1$ $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{3x} - 1}{e^{4x} - 1} = \{t=e^{4x} - 1\} = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{e^{\frac{3 \ln (t+ 1)}{4}} - 1}{t}$$ Not sure where to move on from here, if it is at all possible. Looks like the denominator can be factored by the conjugate rule: $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{3x} - 1}{e^{4x} - 1} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{3x} - 1}{(e^{2x} - 1)(e^{2x} + 1)}$$ Unclear where this trail can lead.

$$P(event) = \frac {20! × 21}{26!} $$ B. This one i found a little trickier, but if this was the probability for one monkey and they want a probabikity for 9 would i set it up like this:
