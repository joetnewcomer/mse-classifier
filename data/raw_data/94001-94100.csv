1285476,Can essentially primitive idempotents be defined both as $e_\lambda=s_\lambda a_\lambda$ and $e_\lambda=a_\lambda s_\lambda$?,"I've been studying representation theory of symmetric group on Tung's Group Theory in Physics . I understood that different Young Diagrams corresponds to inequivalent irreducible representations of symmetric group (Theorem 5.6). In fact, they exhaust all irreducible representations (Theorem 5.7)  and distinct standard Young Tableaux are linearly independent and the direct sum of left ideals generated by them span the whole group algebra space (Theorem 5.8). Apologizing for my ignorance, but I have two questions that I cannot figure out straightforwardly following the derivations and arguments provided in the textbook: (1) It can be shown (Theorem 5.5) that any permutation on a Young Tableaux gives an equivalent representation, so that $e_\lambda^p \equiv p e_\lambda p^{-1}$ is equivalent to $e_\lambda$. Since $e_\lambda^p$ is not necessarily a standard Young Tableaux, while it is an idempotent (since it is equivalent to an idempotent), the left ideal generated by it should be coincided with one of those generated by a standard Young Tableaux? (2) Essentially primitive idempotent is defined (with more derivations given in the appendix IV of the textbook) as $e_\lambda \equiv s_\lambda a_\lambda$. I am wondering, by employing similar arguments used in the appendix (to be specific, one exchanges the line with column, symmetrizer with anti-symmetrizer in the arguments), it occurs to me that $\tilde{e}_\lambda \equiv a_\lambda s_\lambda$ is also essentially primitive idempotent . If I am wrong, which important piece I have missed, if not, will its corresponding left ideal be also coincided with some standard Young Tableaux ? If I stray too far away from the right track, please delete this question. Many thanks.","['group-theory', 'symmetric-groups', 'young-tableaux', 'permutations']"

1285551,Line subbundles of vector bundles on smooth curves,"Let $V$ be a vector bundle of rank at least 2 on a smooth (integral, projective) curve $C$. We know that a global section of $V$ is the same as a morphism $\mathcal{O}_C \to \mathcal{V}$ (letting $\mathcal{V}$ denote the sheaf of sections), and that this section is nonzero if and only if the morphism of sheaves is injective. On the other hand, let $\mathbb{P}(V)$ be the associated projective bundle. A nonzero section $s : C \to V$ defines a rational map to $\mathbb{P}(V)$. Since $C$ is a smooth curve and $\mathbb{P}(V)$ is proper, this extends to an actual morphism $C \to \mathbb{P}(V)$, and so yields an actual line-subbundle $L \subset V$, and (again) an injective morphism of sheaves $\mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{V}$. Question: How can we obtain the line bundle $L$ (and its sheaf of sections) in sheaf language? e.g. is there an algebraic way of converting the morphism $\mathcal{O}_C \to \mathcal{V}$ into the morphism $\mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{V}$ ?

1285582,"Two chess players, A and B, are going to play 7 games. There are three possible outcomes for each game, A wins, A loses, or Tie","Two chess players, A and B, are going to play 7 games. There are three possible outcomes for each game, A wins, A loses, or Tie Addtionally, a win is worth 1 point, draw 0.5 points and loss 0 points. (a) How many possibilities for the games are there such that player A ends up with 3 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses? (b) How many possible outcomes for the games are there such that A ends with four points and B ends with 3 points. (c) Now, assume the first player to 4 points wins and no further matches are played. How many outcomes are there such that the match lasts 7 games and A wins with a score of 4 to 3? (a) There are $3^7$ total possibilities for a string of 7 games. 3 of the 7 games need to be wins for A ${7 \choose 3}$, then 4 of the remaining games need to be draws ${4 \choose 2}$ and then the other two games are losses for B ${2 \choose 2}$. The total is then ${7 \choose 3}{4 \choose 2}{2 \choose 2}=210$ for part a. (b) This should be the sum of the previous answer (210) and the total number of outcomes where A wins 4 games, ${7 \choose 4}$= 35. So, 245. (c) For this one, I guess I just have to subtract from the answer for (b) because this includes the matches that go 7 games. I think there are two terms that need to be subtracted, ${6 \choose 4}{3 \choose 3}$, which denotes all outcomes where A wins four of the first 6 games and B wins the other 3. The other term ${6 \choose 3}{3 \choose 2}$, which is the result where A wins 3 of the first 6 and draws 2 of the remaining 3 games. So, the final answer would be $245-{6 \choose 4}{3 \choose 3}-{6 \choose 3}{3 \choose 2}=170$ Is it okay to subsume ${4 \choose 4}$ and ${5 \choose 4}$ in ${6 \choose 4}$?

My proof is suppose the claim is false then there exists a sequence $\{z_n\}$ such that $\bar{D}(z_n;1/n)$ is not a subset of $V$ for all $n$. This sequence has a sub-sequence $\{z_{n_k}\}$ that converges to $z$ in $K$ (compact). $V$ open so, $\bar{D}(z;r) \subset V$ for some $r > 0$, but $\bar{D}(z_{n_k};1/{n_k}) \subset \bar{D}(z;r)$ for sufficiently large $n_k$ so we have a contradiction.

1285712,Relation between jet and singularities of a curve,"I am trying to understand the relationship between a jet and the singularities of a curve.

Let $f$ be the distance squared function from $({1\over 2},0)$ to $\gamma (t)$ i.e. $$ f(t) = ({1\over 2} - \cos t)^2 + b^2 \sin^2 t$$ For each $t_0$ consider the $2$-jet at $t_0$ of $f$: $$ (\sin t_0 + (b^2 -1)\sin 2 t_0)t + (\cos t_0 + 2(b^2 -1)\cos 2 t_0) t^2$$ Writing this as $c_1 t + c_2 t^2$ the points $(c_1, c_2)$ will trace out a curve $\delta$ as $t_0$ varies. This curve will cross the $c_2-$axis at points where $f$ has a singularity $A_{\ge 1}$ at $t_0$ and will pass through the origin where $f$ has an $A_{\ge2}$ singularity at $t_0$. The geometrical interpretation of this is that $f$ has an $A_{\ge1}$ singularity at $t_0$ iff the normal to the ellipse at $\gamma (t_0)$ passes through $({1\over 2},0)$ and an $A_{\ge 2}$ singularity iff $({1\over 2},0)$ is the centre of curvature at $\gamma (t_0)$.

  contains information about the singularities of the original curve.

In our case, $\rho_k(x) = \rho_k(|x|)$ is radial. Anyway, the author defines a harmonic function $u:\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and then takes the 'convolution' of $u$ and $\rho_k$ to be: $$u_k(x) := (u \star \rho_k)(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}u(y)\rho_k(x-y)dy$$ After justifying that $u_k(x)$ is $C^{\infty}$, he goes on to show that $u_k = u$, and thus to deduce that $u$ is also $C^{\infty}$ and this is where I get lost; first he writes: $$u_k(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}u(y)\rho_k(x-y)dy = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}u(x-z)\rho_k(z)dz = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}u(x-z)\rho_k(|z|)dz$$ Which I understand; however then, he states that we need to transform $z$ into polar coordinates, from which he subsequently writes: $$\begin{align}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}u(x-z)\rho_k(|z|)dz = \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{S^{n-1}}u(x + z(r,\theta))\rho_k(r)r^{n-1}d\theta dr &= \int_{S^{n-1}}\int_{0}^{\infty}u(x)\rho_k(r)r^{n-1}d\theta dr\end{align}$$ First, what substitution exactly is made here?

$\sum_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}$ converges then $X_{\alpha}$ is not equal to zero at most a countably many times. I know that there is a similar question on the Math Stack exchange website but I am having serious troubles understanding the logic behind the proof in the class The proof given by @Benji makes  complete sense. The sum of an uncountable number of positive numbers We had a very similar proof in the class which was partly discussed in the comment section . We used the definition that A sequence $\sum_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}$ is convergent iff $\sup_{F \subset A} \sum_{\alpha \in F}X_{\alpha} < \infty$ where $F$ refers to a finite subset of $A$ The proof is as follows: Proof: By Contradiction. We assume that $\sum_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}$ converges and $\{ \alpha |X_{\alpha}>0 \}$ is uncountable we defined sets $S_n=\{\alpha |X_\alpha >\frac{1}{n}\}$ but the we have 
$\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} S_n=\{\alpha |X_\alpha >0\}$
But by assumption the RHS is uncountable and since LHS is countable union of sets , then it implies that $\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $S_N$ is uncountable (Please note in the following whenever I use $F$ , it is a finite subset of A) Now the prof concludes that $\sup_{F \subset A} \sum_{\alpha \in F}X_{\alpha} = \infty$ And from the definition in bond it follows that $\sum _{\alpha \in A}X_{\alpha}$ does not converge and we get a contradiction Now if I consider the set $S_N=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots \dots\}$ defined as before i.e $X_{\alpha_j}>\frac{1}{N}$ $\forall \alpha_j  \in S_N$ and consider a generic $F=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots ,\alpha_k \}$ Then $\sum_{\alpha \in F \subset S_N} X_{\alpha}>\frac{k}{N}$ for any k  as cardinality of F needs to be finite So therefore I have that $\sup_{F \in \mathcal{F}} \sum_{\alpha \in F} X_{\alpha} <\sup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \frac{k}{N}=\infty$ where $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of all finite subsets of $A$ **I don't understand why does $S_N$ need to be uncountable for this thing thing to work.

1286249,Examples of predictable processes,"I am asked to prove that the following processes are predictable. I am used to looking at stochastic processes as sequences of random variables (by fixing time) or as a collection of paths (by fixing $\omega$) but I find it hard to picture the two varying together. For this reason the notions of predictability and progressive measurability somewhat escape me. Anyway, here are the processes I am interested in. (a) Suppose $h : \mathbf{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ is a Borel measurable function. Show that $X(t,\omega) = h(t)$ is predictable. Here is my attempt. First I fix an arbitrary Borel set $B\in\mathbf{R}$. Then I say $\{(t,\omega): X(t,\omega)\in B\} = \{(t,\Omega): h(t)\in B\} = (\bar{B},\Omega)$ for some $\bar{B}\in \mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{R}_+}$. The first equality is due to the deterministic nature of $h$ and the second one is due to the fact it is Borel measurable. Since I can generate $(\bar{B},\Omega)$ by using sets of the form $((a,b],\Omega)$, which are all in the predictable $\sigma$-algebra, $(\bar{B},\Omega)$ is also in the predictable $\sigma$-algebra. Does this sound right? (b): $X$ is a predictable process. $g :\mathbf{R} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ is a Borel function. Then, $Z_t = g(X_t)$ is also predictable.
The intuitive answer that I would give is that Borel functions preserve measurability. Hence, if $X$ is measurable with respect to a sigma algebra, then $g(X)$ is also measurable with respect to that sigma algebra. But this doesn't constitute a rigorous answer so I write the following. $$\{(t,\omega): g(X(t,\omega)) \in B\} = \{(t,\omega): X(t,\omega) \in \bar{B}\}$$
The RHS is in the predictable sigma algebra since $X$ is predictable so this is it I guess. (c): $X$ is a predictable process. $g :\mathbf{R}_+\times\mathbf{R} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ is a Borel function. $Z_t = g(t,X_t)$ is predictable. There is a hint which suggests that I start with functions of the form $h(t)g(X_t)$ and apply the $\pi-\lambda$ lemma. I know that the product of two measurable functions is again measurable. So $h(t)g(X_t)$ is predictable. But I don't see how one could apply the $\pi-\lambda$ lemma to extend the result to arbitrary functions of the form $g(t,X_t)$?","['stochastic-analysis', 'stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory']"

For $2 \times 2$ real entries matrices, e.g., all the subrings of $M(2,\mathbb{R})$ generated by $I$ and a matrix $J$ such that $J^2=-I$ are matrix representations of $\mathbb{C}$.
This means that any matrix of the form
$$
J=\left[
\begin {array}{cccc}
a&b\\
c&-a
\end{array}
\right]
\qquad bc \le-1 \qquad a=\sqrt{-1-bc}

 is a possible representation of the imaginary unity $i$ and a complex number $z=x+iy$ is represented by the matrix $M(z)=Z=xI+yJ$ I think that this fact can be see as a consequence of the Artin–Wedderburn theorem about the matrix representation of rings ( see my answer to: What does it mean to represent a number in term of a $2\times2$ matrix? ), 
 that generalize such kind of representation to all semisimple rings. Now, consider $\mathbb{C}$ as a $^*$Algebra (with complex conjugation as the involution). If we search a $^*$Algebra isomorphism such that $M(\bar z)=M^T(z)$ (where the involution for the matrix ring is the transpose), we see that there are only two possible representations, with : $$
J=\left[
\begin {array}{cccc}

\qquad \mbox{or}\qquad
J=\left[

Let $\pi:E\to M$ be a rank $k$ smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold $M$. I will below describe how to form the dual bundle, wherein lies my question . Let $E_p=\pi^{-1}(p)$ for each $p\in M$, and define $E^*=\bigsqcup_{p\in M}E_p^*$. Further define $\pi^*:E^*\to M$ as $\pi(E^*_p)=\{p\}$ for all $p\in M$. The main part is to define the local trivializations. For each local trivialization $\Phi:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times \R^k$ of $E$ over $U$, define $\Phi^*:\pi^{*-1}(U)\to U\times \R^{k*}$ as
$$\Phi^*(\omega)=(p, (\Phi|_{E_p})^{-t}\omega)$$
for all $\omega\in E_p^*$, and all $p\in U$. (The '$t$' denotes the transpose). The problem with the above definition is that a local trivialization is supposed to map $\pi^{*-1}(U)$ to $U\times \R^k$ and not $U\times \R^{k*}$.
Now I know that $\R^k$ can be canonical identified with $\R^{k*}$ provided we have an inner product on $\R^k$.

Is there a preferred inner product with respect to which the identification of $\R^k$ with $\R^{k*}$ is made?","['differential-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds', 'vector-bundles']"

I have thought it over for some time but really cannot figure out a proof of this statement. Let me try to state the question more clearly below. Consider a tensor $T^a$ where $a$ refers to a list of contravariant indices, like $T^{1234}$. Now one may symmetrize this tensor according to a given Young Tableaux, namely $\tau$, and the resulting tensor is denoted by $$T^{\tau(a)}.$$ It is noted that, according to theorems on representations of symmetric group $S_n$, $\tau$ corresponds to a irreducible representation of $S_n$. Now one considers a covariant tensor ${T'_b}$ and a different Young Tableaux $\lambda$, where $b$ contains the same number of indices, $\tau$ and $\lambda$ are not equivalent (one may assume $\tau$ > $\lambda$ without loss of generality). It is stated that the contraction $$T^{\tau(a)}T'_{\lambda(a)}=0.$$ It is obviously true when $\tau$ corresponds to the symmetrizer and $\lambda$ is the anti-symmetrizer .

I proved to solve it. This is my attempt: substituting for $x^2=u$ and $y^2=v$ the equation becomes a Diophantine linear equation:$$343u-27v=1$$
using Euclid's algorithm to solve the equation, the solutions are:
$$

substituting these solutions in first equation we obtain:

1286711,"""Vectors aren't really numbers"" - how sound is that statement?","Since I first learned about vectors, I noticed something interesting: almost any numeric formula can be replaced by a vectorial formula by just replacing addition, multiplication, etc., with their vectorial elementwise versions. For example: average a b = (a + b) / 2 not only gets the average of 2 numbers, but the mid-point between 2 vectors if you use the elementwise addition. On Calculus, many formulas for integrals can be extended to triple, quadruple integrals unchanged the same way. Even more interestingly, some formulas gain a dimensional generality by doing so. distance a b = modulus (a - b) That formula holds for numbers, returning their difference, but also works for any n-dimensional vectors, returning their n-dimensional distance. Even complicated formulas such as: intersectAABB (Ray r_pos r_dir) (AABB aabb_min aabb_max) 
    = [tmin, tmax] where
        t1   = (aabb_min - r_pos) / r_dir
        t2   = (aabb_max - r_pos) / r_dir
        tmin = foldr1 max (liftI2 min t1 t2)
        tmax = foldr1 min (liftI2 max t1 t2) get the same benefit. On this case, intersectAABB , used for numbers, returns the intersection distance between a line and a segment. Used with 2d vectors, it returns the intersection distances between a line and a rectangle. With 3d vectors, the intersection distances between a line and a cuboid. And so on. All that leads me to believe it makes a lot of sense to use vectors just like number. My question is: why is nobody doing so? Why are dot and cross considered the vectorial version of multiplication when they're mostly completely different operations? Is there any case where using vectors in place of numbers stops making sense?","['vector-spaces', 'soft-question', 'geometry', 'analysis', 'vectors']"

1286998,Something Isn't Right With My Parking,"A few days ago in my Calculus BC class we were given a page of 6 challenging end of the year problems. That was a refreshing change from the drudgery we usually do (WebAssign). One of them went like this: There is a street of length 4 on which cars of length 1 wish to park.  However, instead of parking in a nice organized way, they park at random, picking uniformly from the available positions to park (they are apparently jerks).  Assuming no cars leave, and continue to arrive until no more can fit, what is the expected number of cars that will fit? I tried solving the problem by finding the probabilities of 2 and 3 cars. When I looked up the answer at https://cornellmath.wordpress.com/2008/01/08/the-efficiency-of-random-parking/ the answer was transcendental while mine was rational. I messed up somewhere along the way or in one of my assumptions. I'd like to know why my solution is incorrect. My Solution: So we start with a street of length $4$ which can be represented by a number line starting from $0$ and ending at $4$, i.e. the interval $[0, 4]$. Say the first car takes up the interval $[a_1, a_1+1]$, where $0\le a_1 \le 3$. Now, the choice of parking for the first car limits where the second car can park. Let the left endpoint of the second car be $a_2$. Then, just as above, we have $0\le a_2 \le 3$. Additionally, $a_2$ must either be greater than or equal to the right endpoint of the first car ($a_2 \ge a_1 + 1$), or lesser than or equal to one minus the left endpoint of the first car($a_2 \le a_1 - 1$). These restrictions determine a ""sample space"" (I think that is the appropriate term but I am not sure) of tuples $(a_1, a_2)$. This sample space can then be depicted by a region bounded between curves in cartesian coordinates. I have uploaded a picture of my hand drawn graph. The shaded region represents the sample space. I will now explain how I got the boundaries for the sample space. If $0\le a_1\le 2$ then, from what I said previously, we have $a_1 +1 \le a_2\le3$. Similarly, if $1\le a_1\le3$ then $0\ge a_2\ge a_1-1$. Note that when $1\le a_1\le2$ we take the union of the described regions. Now this is the home stretch. It is clear that the choice of $(a_1, a_2)$ dictates whether a third car will fit or not. So the question becomes ""what percentage of tuples allow for a third car to fit?"" If we look at the interval where $1\le a_1\le2$ we see that regardless of where we place the second car there will always be room for a third. So this region is part of the answer. Let's look at when $0\le a_1\le1$. In this case, no cars can fit before the first, so a third car could only fit if there was an empty space of length one between the second car and the right end of the street, or if there was enough space between the first and second car. The first case is true when $a_2\le2$. The second is true when $a_2\ge a_1 + 2$. Symmetry can be used to find analogous boundaries when $2\le a_1\le3$. All of these inequalities form bounded regions whose areas can be easily calculated. In the end the probability of fitting 3 cars comes out to $\frac{3}{4}$!

It doesn't seem like it is supposed to be a hard problem, but never the less I am having trouble wrapping my head around it. Additionally I assume that for (2) we are not interested in the trivial solution $F=0$. [Added for completeness] To do part (1), we recognize that if $\deg(f),\deg(g)\le n$, then $$\deg\left([f(t)]^e[g(t)]^f\right)\le ne+nf\le nm$$
Hence if we have more than $nm+1$ polynomials of the form $[f(t)]^e[g(t)]^f$ then we have a dependent set (since $d+1$ is the dimension of the vector space of polynomials of degree less than or equal to $d$). Now we simply count the number of polynomials in this form (this was an exercise before the problem) - it is $\binom{m+2}{2}=\frac{1}{2}(m+1)(m+2)$ from a standard application of stars and bars . Ensuring $m$ large enough (specifically $m>2n-3$) gives us the conclusion.","['affine-geometry', 'ideals', 'parametric', 'algebraic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1287163,Are there invariants of formal group laws other than height?,"By a theorem of Lazard, 1-d formal group laws over separably closed fields of char $p$ are classified up to isomorphism by their height. Are there invariants of formal group laws other than height (and the characteristic of their underlying field) that are not isomorphism invariants? I've been informed that if k is algebraically closed and char p, then elliptic curves are classified by the j-invariant. Lazard's theorem says that their associated FormalGrpLaws are isomorphic to the unique 1-dimensional FormalGrpLaw of height 1 or of height 2 (the Honda formal group law). So there are certainly more EllipticCurve/k than FormalGrpLaw/k! Besides, say, distinguishing between a singular and supersingular elliptic curve, what properties of the original group scheme $G \to \text{Spec}  R$ are recoverable after choosing a concrete isomorphism $G \simeq \text{Spf }R[[t]]$?","['formal-groups', 'abelian-varieties', 'algebraic-geometry', 'group-schemes']"

1287198,Why Does The Taylor Remainder Formula Work?,"I've been studying calculus on my own and have come across Taylor series. It is very intuitive until I came across the remainder part of the formula where things got fuzzy. I understand why the remainder exists but not the mathematical description. Why is the value being plugged into the derivative of the remainder some number between $x$ and $a$? What is the connection to the mean value theorem? Is the remainder used to bound the function? Lastly and my most important question is what is the intuitive (for me most likely a geometrical approach would be great) for how this remainder is derived. I've spent a long time trying to figure it out for myself and looking online but it seems I'm missing something for there are virtually no questions being asked about this. Thanks for you time,

1287211,Is $L^1_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$ complete with the norm $|f|=\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}\int_x^{x+1}|f(y)|dy$,"Let $BL^1_{loc}$ be the space of locally integrable functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ such that $|f|=\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}\int_x^{x+1}|f(y)|dy<\infty$. Is this space complete ? What I tried :
Let $(f_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of $BL^1_{loc}$ such that $$\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}\int_x^{x+1}|f_p(y)-f_q(y)|dy\to0,$$ when $p,q\to\infty$. Then, we have $$\int_{-N}^{N}|f_p(y)-f_q(y)|dy\to0,$$  for any $N$, so the sequence of functions $f_n$ is Cauchy in $L^1([-N,N])$ for each $N$, so we have an $L^1-$limit function $f$ for each compact interval, but I don't know if this function satisfies $$\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}\int_x^{x+1}|f_n(y)-f(y)|dy\to 0.$$I see that I didn't use the fact that we have uniformity for $x\in \mathbb{R}$.","['functional-analysis', 'lp-spaces', 'banach-spaces', 'general-topology', 'cauchy-sequences']"

1287239,Computing Fréchet derivative,"I am reading Methods in Nonlinear Analysis by Kung-Ching Chang and having trouble in obataining a Fréchet derivative in the text. For those who has the book, it is on page 37, which concern Euler elastic rod. Let

$F: X \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow Y$ be the map $$(u,\lambda) \rightarrow u''+\lambda \sin u.$$ The book claimed that $F''_{u\lambda}(0,n^2)=\cos (nu)|_{u=0}=I$, where $I$ is the identity map. First, I am not quite sure about what the notation $F''_{u\lambda}(0,n^2)$ mean, I guess it mean double partial Fréchet derivative evaluated at $(0,n^2)$, but I am not able to arrive that result. So far, I can only obtain the partial Fréchet derivative $$
