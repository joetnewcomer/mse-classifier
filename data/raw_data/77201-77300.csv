978815,Is the derivative of the characteristic polynomial equal to the sum of characteristic polynomial of principal submatrices?,"Let $A$ by an $n \times n$ matrix over the complex numbers and let $\phi(A,x) = \det(xI-A)$ be the characteristic polynomial of $A$.  Let $B_i$ be the principal submatrix of $A$ formed by deleting the $i$-th row and column of $A$. Let $\phi(B_i,x)$ be the characteristic polynomial of $B_i$. Is it always true that the derivative of $\phi(A,x)$ is the sum of $\phi(B_i,x)$ as $i$ ranges across the rows/columns of $A$? That is, is the following an identity ?
$$ \frac{d\ \phi(A,x)}{dx} = \sum_i \phi(B_i,x) $$ If not, what is a small counterexample?  (The equation works for all $2 \times 2$ matrices and all adjacency matrices of graphs....)","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'graph-theory']"
978851,Is the plane minus the integer lattice homeomorphic to the plane minus the integers?,"The question, more rigorously posed, is: Is $\Bbb R^2-\Bbb Z^2$ homeomorphic to $\Bbb R^2-\Bbb Z\times\{0\}$? This question has been bugging me in the back of my head for a while now. Sometimes, I think it's clear that they are, and then I think it's clear that they aren't. Nothing from Point-set topology is helping me solve this, at least as far as I see. And the only help from algebraic topology that I'm familiar with is the fundamental group; however, these two spaces seem to have the same fundamental group. Any help in alleviating my torment is appreciated.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"
978855,Proving a strange identity,"Numerically, it would seem the following identity holds true: $$\frac{6}{7}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{\sum_{k=3}^\infty{\left(k-\sum_{j=1}^{k}\frac{1}{j}\right)^{-n}}}$$ Down below I have proven that the right side of the equation exists between 0 and 1. Let $H_k$ be the $k$ th harmonic number. Consider the sequence $x_k=k-H_k$. It is easy to show that $x_k$ is increasing. Therefore, $x_k>1$ for all $k \geq 3$ since $x_3 = \frac{7}{6} > 1$. It follows that $x_k^{-n}$ decreases as $n$ increases if $k \geq 3$. Now consider the following sequence: $$
y_n = \sum_{k=3}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{x_k^n}}$$ Because the terms of the series $y_n$ decrease as $n$ increases, it suffices to prove than $y_2$ converges to show that all $y_n$ converge if $n>1$. $\zeta(2)$ is a known convergent series: $$
\frac{x_k^2}{k^2}=\frac{k^2-2kH_k+H_k^2}{k^2}=\frac{1-2\frac{H_k}{k}+\left(\frac{H_k}{k}\right)^2}{1}\to1$$ By the limit comparison test, $y_2$ converges. Therefore all $y_n$ with $n>1$ converge and $\{y_n\}_{n=2}^\infty$ is a well defined sequence. A final sequence shall be defined: $$z_n = \sqrt[n]{y_n}$$ $\sqrt[n]{a}\to 1$ as $n\to\infty$ for some constant positive real $a$. From the facts that $y_n$ is decreasing and $\sqrt[n]{y_2} \geq \sqrt[n]{y_n} \geq 0$ we can deduce that $\lim_{n\to\infty} z_n$ exists and is in $[0, 1]$. Questions: Is my identity correct? How can this be shown? Is the above proof correct? Bonus: From the previous result and the Cauchy root test we can deduce the following series converges. Can you find out more about its value? $$

978880,Getting U.C.P map on group operator algebras using Fell's absorbtion principle.,"I'm struggling a bit with this theorem: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete group and $\mathbb{C}\Gamma$ be the group ring of $\Gamma$ i.e.
the set of formal sums $\sum_{t \in \Gamma} \alpha_t t$. Furthermore let
$\mathbb{C}^*_\lambda(\Gamma) \subseteq B(\ell^2(\Gamma))$ be the completion of $\mathbb{C}\Gamma$ wrt. the norm $||x|| = ||\lambda(x)||_{op}$ where $\lambda$ is the left representation of $\Gamma$ on $B(\ell^2(\Gamma))$. Let $L(\Gamma) = (\mathbb{C}\Gamma)''$ be the completion of $\mathbb{C}\Gamma$ wrt. the weak operator topology. Finally let $C^*(\Gamma)$ be the completion of $\mathbb{C}\Gamma$ wrt. to the norm
$||x|| = sup_\pi||\pi(x)||_{op}$ (taken over all unitary representations $\pi$ of 
$\Gamma$ on $B(\ell^2(\Gamma))$). If and A and B are $C^*$-algebras, we say that a map $\phi: A \rightarrow B$ is u.c.p if 
$\phi$ is unital and $\phi_n: M_n(A) \rightarrow M_n(B)$ defined by
$\phi_n([a_{i,j}]) = [\phi(a_{i,j})]$ maps positively(maps positive matrices to positive matrices). $\phi$ is called normal if it is continuous wrt. ultra-weak topology. Theorem: Let $\phi: \Gamma \Rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a function with $\phi(e) = 1$, and define $\psi_\phi: \mathbb{C}\Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ $$\psi_\phi(\sum_{t \in \Gamma}\alpha_t t) = \sum_{t \in \Gamma}\alpha_t \phi(t) $$
And $m_\phi: \mathbb{C}\Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{C}\Gamma$ 
$$m_\phi(\sum_{t \in \Gamma}\alpha_t t) = \sum_{t \in \Gamma}\alpha_t \phi(t)t $$ Show that if the functional $\psi_\phi$ extends to a state on $C^*(\Gamma)$, then
$m_\phi$ extends to a u.c.p map on either $C^*(\Gamma)$ or $C^*_\lambda(\Gamma)$, or
extends to a normal u.c.p map on $L(\Gamma)$. So the proof uses Fell's absorbtion principle, which states that given any representation
$\pi:\Gamma \rightarrow H$ on a Hilbert space H, then $\lambda \otimes \pi$ is unitarily equivalent to $\lambda \otimes 1_H$. So there exists a unitary operator V which conjugates 
$C^*_{\lambda}(\Gamma) \otimes 1$ onto $C^*_{\lambda}(\Gamma) \otimes C^*(\Gamma)$. The map which does the job is 
$$\sigma(\sum_{t} \alpha_t \lambda_t \otimes 1_H) = \sum_{t} \alpha_t \lambda_t \otimes t$$ 
Since $C^*_{\lambda}(\Gamma) \otimes 1 \simeq C^*_{\lambda}(\Gamma)$ i assume we can identify $\sigma$ as an operator from $C^*_{\lambda}(\Gamma)$ into $C^*_{\lambda}(\Gamma) \otimes C^*(\Gamma)$ with 
$$\sigma(\sum_{t} \alpha_t \lambda_t) = \sum_{t} \alpha_t \lambda_t \otimes t$$ which is a $^*$-homomorphism. They now argue(which is the point where i fall off) , that
this extends to a normal $^*$-homomorphism $\bar{\sigma}$ from $L\Gamma$ into $L\Gamma \otimes B(H)$. By assumption the functional $\psi_\phi$ extends to a state $\widetilde{\psi_\phi}$ on $C^*(\Gamma)$, if we let $\nu = id_{L(\Gamma)}
\otimes \widetilde{\psi_\phi}$, then $\nu: L(\Gamma) \otimes C^*(\Gamma) \rightarrow L(\Gamma) \otimes \mathbb{C}$. And 
$$ \nu \circ \bar{\sigma}(\sum_{t} \alpha_t t) = \sum_{t} \alpha_t 
t \otimes \widetilde{\phi}(t) = \sum_{t} \alpha_t 
t \widetilde{\phi}(t) \otimes 1_{\mathbb{C}} \in L(\Gamma) \otimes \mathbb{C} \simeq L(\Gamma) $$
So this gives an extension of $m_\phi$ if we consider $\nu \otimes \bar{\sigma}$ as a map from $C(\Gamma)$ into $C(\Gamma)$. Is this sort of the way that you are supposed to go, or am i completely wrong? Since this is a $^*$-homomorphism it is u.c.p, but why is it normal? Does $$C_\lambda^*(\Gamma) \subseteq L\Gamma$$ automatically imply the reduced case? And how do you show the $C^*(\Gamma)$ case?","['operator-theory', 'operator-algebras', 'group-theory']"

979056,Integral $\int \tan^{5}(x)\text{ d}x$,"I would like guidance on evaluating
$$\displaystyle\int \tan^{5}(x)\text{ d}x\text{.}$$
I have attempted using the Pythagorean identities to get
$$\int\tan^{5}(x)\text{ d}x = \int \tan(x)\left[\sec^{2}(x)-1\right]^{2}\text{ d}x\text{.}$$
This doesn't look helpful. So I thought, why not turn only ONE of the $\tan^{2}$ terms to the $\sec^{2}-1$ form? This gives
$$\int\tan^{5}(x)\text{ d}x = \int\tan^{3}(x)\sec^{2}(x)\text{ d}x-\int \tan^{3}(x)\text{ d}x\text{.}$$
Clearly the second term is $\dfrac{\tan^{4}(x)}{4}$ (ignoring the constant term for now). Using a similar trick,
$$\begin{align}
\int\tan^{3}(x)\text{ d}x &= \int \tan(x)\sec^{2}(x)\text{ d}x-\int\tan(x)\text{ d}x \\
&= \dfrac{\tan^{2}(x)}{2} - (-1)\ln|\cos(x)| \\
&= \dfrac{\tan^{2}(x)}{2}+\ln|\cos(x)|\text{.}

So this suggests to me that 
$$\int\tan^{5}(x)\text{ d}x = \dfrac{\tan^{4}(x)}{4} - \dfrac{\tan^{2}(x)}{2}-\ln|\cos(x)| + C\text{.}$$
But the answer in Stewart (section 7.2., #31) is 
$$\dfrac{1}{4}\sec^{4}(x)-\tan^{2}(x)+\ln|\sec(x)|+C\text{.}$$
It's very clear where the $\ln|\sec(x)|$ term is coming from - and I tried to take the difference of my answer and Stewart's answer using Wolfram Alpha and unfortunately, the difference is not a constant.

979079,Notation in formula for tensor product of Hadamard matrix,"I'm having trouble understanding the notation used in a linear algebra exercise (it's exercise 2.33 of Nielsen and Chuang's ""Quantum Computation and Quantum Information"", page 74). The exercise gives the Hadamard matrix $$H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigl[ (|0\rangle + |1\rangle)\langle 0| + (|0\rangle - |1\rangle)\langle 1|  \Bigr]$$ and asks us to show that $$H^{\otimes n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x,y} (-1)^{x \cdot y} |x \rangle \langle y|$$ My understanding is that $x$ and $y$ in the sum run through the basis vectors for the tensor product space, but my problem is that I don't understand what they're supposed to mean in the exponent of $(-1)$. I thought I was supposed to interpret them in base $2$ (""$00$"" as $0$, ""$10$"" as $2$, etc.), but then then the formula doesn't seem to work. For example, taking $n=2$ and computing the tensor product using the matrix representation of $H$: $$H^{\otimes 2} = H \otimes H
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \begin{array}{rr}
 1 \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 1&1 \\ 1&-1 \end{array} \right] &

979082,Tietze Extension Theorem,"I saw Tietze extension theorem . Since its proof is non-trivial, I tried whether we can clarify it intuitively for functions of one real variable.

To prove this, I proceeded as follows: $K^c$ is open, hence it is disjoint union of open intervals. We try to extend $f$ continuously on each connected component, say $(a,b)$ of $K^c$. Since $a,b$ are elements of $K$, we define $f$ on $(a,b)$ in such a way that its graph on $(a,b)$ is the line with end points $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b)$. In this way, $f$ can be defined on complement of $K$, and it seems to me obvious that $f$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.

979166,How to define a taxonomy of non associative operations?,"Let $A$ be a set, and let $a,b,c\in A$. Let also $\circ: A\times A\rightarrow A$ be a binary operation on $A$. We agree as usual to write $a\circ b$ to mean $\circ(a,b)$. We say that $\circ$ is associative if for any $a,b,c\in A$ the following holds:
\begin{equation}
(a\circ b)\circ c=a\circ (b\circ c)
\end{equation}
That's OK, but given three elements in $A$ there are many ways to compose them. In particular, we can compute the following $12$ compositions:
\begin{equation}
(a\circ b)\circ c\qquad\qquad
a\circ (b\circ c)\\
(a\circ c)\circ b\qquad\qquad
a\circ (c\circ b)\\
(b\circ a)\circ c \qquad\qquad
b\circ (a\circ c) \\
(b\circ c) \circ a \qquad\qquad

(c\circ a)\circ b \qquad\qquad
c\circ (a\circ b) \\
(c\circ b)\circ a \qquad\qquad
c\circ (b\circ a)

They are of course $12$ because we are permuting $3$ objects and for each permutation we have $2$ ways of putting meaningful parentheses, so $3!\cdot 2 = 12$. Associativity means that we identify the first (top left) object with the second (top right); this has a strong meaning to us because usual number fields ($\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}$) behave in this way. My question is: what happens if we identify the first relation with a different one taken from the other $11$? Are there some relevant (i.e. studied in literature) examples of such structures? The only examples I could find of non associative structures like this are defined over more complex objects, for example the cross product on $\mathbb{R}^3$ or generally a Lie bracket is not associative but is defined over a vector space.

Also, try as I might, I can't make a sketch of a triangle that obeys this non-parallel alignment specification. Any ideas?","['geometry', 'triangles', 'coordinate-systems']"

Prove that it is possible to find some boxes that together contain exactly one hundred balls. Assume to the contrary that no class of boxes contains $100$ balls. If there is a box with exactly $2$ balls, there is no class of boxes with $98$ balls, which implies that there is no class of boxes with $96$ balls. Continuing this way we see that there is no class containing $4$ balls, so there is no class containing $2$ other than the initial box with $2$ balls, i.e, this box is unique. Now, if there is a box with $1$ ball, then there is no class of $99$ balls and continuing this way, there is no class of $2$ balls so no box with $1$ ball other than our initial box with $1$ ball.

UPDATE: I've done some more work and have come up with the following: Based on the equations I combined to arrive at $f(A,B,C)$, it follows that: $$f(A,B,C)>2\Rightarrow A>B>C>1$$ and $$f(A,B,C)=2\Rightarrow A>C>B>1$$ My further work: Let $f(A,B,C)=k$ where $k>1$ is an integer. Rewrite $f(A,B,C)$ as $$k=\frac{A-\frac{1}{A}+B-\frac{1}{B}}{C-\frac{1}{C}}$$ Thus $$A-\frac{1}{A}+B-\frac{1}{B}-k(C-\frac{1}{C})=A-\frac{1}{A}+B-\frac{1}{B}-kC+\frac{k}{C}=0$$ Note that $\frac{1}{A}+\frac{1}{B}<1$ for all integer $A,B$ such that $A>B>1$. Now we consider three cases: $1)$ $k<C$, $2)$ $k=C$, $3)$ $k>C$. Case $1$: $k<C$ Since $\frac{k}{C}<1$ it follows that these equations hold:$$A+B=kC$$ $$\frac{1}{A}+\frac{1}{B}=\frac{A+B}{AB}=\frac{k}{C}$$ By substitution $$\frac{kC}{AB}=\frac{k}{C}\Rightarrow AB=C^2$$ This is only true if $A=np^2$, $B=nq^2$, and $C=npq$ for integers $n,p,q\geq 1$ and $p>q$. From this we have $$p^2>pq; pq>q^2\Rightarrow p^2>pq>q^2\Rightarrow np^2>npq>nq^2\Rightarrow A>C>B>1\Rightarrow k\leq2$$ This last condition, $k\leq2$, follows from the conditions stated above and leaves us with two possibilities: $k=2$ or $k=1$. If $k=1$ we have $A+B=C$ which violates the condition $A>C$. If $k=2$ we have $A+B=2C\Rightarrow \frac{A+B}{2}=C$. By substitution we have $$\frac{A+B}{AB}=\frac{2}{\frac{A+B}{2}}$$ $$4AB=(A+B)^2\Rightarrow A^2-2AB+B^2=0\Rightarrow (A-B)^2=0$$ However, this leads to the result that $A=B$ which violates that stated conditions. Case $1$, $k<C$, fails. Case $2$: $k=C$ Since $\frac{k}{C}=1$ it follows that $$A+B+1=C^2$$ $$\frac{1}{A}+\frac{1}{B}=0$$ This later equation is clearly false and thus Case $2$, $k=C$ fails. Case $3$: $k>C$ Let $p,q$ be integers with $C>q\geq0$ and $p>1$. From this we can write $k$ as $k=pC+q$. Note that $q=0 \Rightarrow A+B+p=C^2$ and $\frac{1}{A}+\frac{1}{B}=0$ (as above) which is clearly a contradiction, so $q\geq1$. Substituting in $k$ above we have $$A-\frac{1}{A}+B-\frac{1}{B}-pC^2-qC+p+\frac{q}{C}=0$$ Applying the same logic as above we have the following equations $$\frac{A+B}{AB}=\frac{q}{C}$$ $$A+B=pC^2+qC-p$$ By substitution we have the following system of equations (one cubic and one quadratic) $$pC^3+qC^2-pC=qAB\Rightarrow pC^3+qC^2-pC-qAB=0$$ $$pC^2+qC-p-A-B=0$$ Since at least one $C$ that works must solve both equations we denote the roots of the cubic as $x_1,x_2,x_3$ and the roots of the quadratic as $x_1,y_2$. By Vieta's formulas we have $$x_1+x_2+x_3=-\frac{q}{p}$$ $$x_1 x_2+x_1 x_3+x_2 x_3=-1$$ $$x_1 x_2 x_3=\frac{qAB}{p}$$ and $$x_1+y_2=-\frac{q}{p}$$ $$x_1 y_2= -\frac{p+A+B}{p}$$ From the first equations (setting $x_1+x_2+x_3=x_1+y_2$) we have $y_2=x_2+x_3$. Thus $$x_1 y_2=x_1 x_2+x_1 x_3=-\frac{p+A+B}{p}\Rightarrow x_2 x_3-\frac{p+A+B}{p}=-1\Rightarrow x_2 x_3=\frac{A+B}{p}$$ $$x_2 x_3=\frac{A+B}{p}\Rightarrow x_1\frac{A+B}{p}=\frac{qAB}{p}\Rightarrow x_1=\frac{qAB}{A+B}$$ Since $x_1=C$ and $B>C$ we have $$B>\frac{qAB}{A+B}\Rightarrow B^2>(q-1)AB$$ Since $A>B$ it follows $AB>B^2$ and so $q-1<1\Rightarrow q<2$. Since $q\neq0$ (see above) we have $q=1$ and so $C=\frac{AB}{A+B}$. Substituting for $C$ in the quadratic (although the cubic has the same result) we have $$0=p(\frac{AB}{A+B})^2+\frac{AB}{A+B}-p-A-B$$ Which, after a fair bit of rearranging, becomes $$p=\frac{(A+B)^3-AB(A+B)}{(AB)^2-(A+B)^2}$$ Thus $f(A,B,C)$ is an integer (with $A,B,C$ constrained as above) iff $$p=\frac{(A+B)^3-AB(A+B)}{(AB)^2-(A+B)^2}$$ has integer solutions $p>0$ and $A>B>2$. Any help with solving this last bit would be greatly appreciated.

979958,automorphism of the projective space $\mathbb{P}_A^n$,"In exercise 16.4.B of Vakil's notes, he establishes that the group of automorphisms of $\mathbb{P}_k^n$ is $PGL_{n+1}(k)$. This I can manage to show, but in the remarks following the exercise he asks why this does not work over an arbitrary base ring $A$, and I have a hard time to see why. I have three questions and would be grateful if someone can comment on them: 1) First, is it true that $\pi^*O_{\mathbb{P}_A}(1)\simeq O_{\mathbb{P}_A}(1)$ if $\pi:\mathbb{P}_A^{n}\to\mathbb{P}_A^{n}$ is an automorphism? Over a field $k$, this holds because an automorphism induces an isomorphism on Picard groups. So a generator must be sent to a generator, but I do not understand the Picard group of $\mathbb{P}_A^{n+1}$, so I can't see if this generalizes. In any case, if it is true, please give an argument. If it's not, please give a counter-example. 2) Does it make sense to define $PGL_{n+1}(-)$ as the functor that sends $A$ to the set of $(n+1)\times (n+1)$  invertible matrices over $A$ modulo multiples of identity? If so, is it representable (possibly in some sub-category of schemes over $A$)? 3) If $PGL_{n+1}(A)$ does not parametrize automorphisms of $\mathbb{P}_A^{n+1}$, what does it parametrize? 4) Is there a good description of automorphisms of $\mathbb{P}_A^n$?",['algebraic-geometry']
979993,Help understand part of the proof. Radius of convergence is $\frac{1}{\limsup |a_n|^{1/n}}$,"Can you help me understand the highlighted parts of the proof. Thanks :) Theorem: Let $\sum{a_nz^n}$ be a power series, let r be its radius of convergence. Then $\frac{1}{r} = \limsup |a_n|^{1/n}$. Proof: Let $t = \limsup |a_n|^{1/n}$. Suppose first that $t \ne 0, \infty$. Give $\epsilon > 0$, there exits only a finite number of n such that $|a_n|^{1/n} \ge t + \epsilon$. Thus for all but a finite number of n, we have $|a_n| \le (t +\epsilon)^n$, whence the series $\sum{a_nz^n}$ converges absolutely if $|z| < \frac{1}{t+\epsilon}$,  by comparison with the geometric series . Therefore the radius of convergence $r$ satisfies $r \ge \frac{1}{t+\epsilon}$ for every $\epsilon > 0$, whence $r\ge \frac{1}{t}$. Conversely, given $\epsilon$ there exists infinitely many n such that $|a_n|^{1/n} \ge t-\epsilon$ and therefore, $|a_n|\ge (t-\epsilon)^n$. Hence the series $\sum{a_nz^n}$ does not converge if $|z| = \frac{1}{t-\epsilon}$, because it's $n^{th}$ term doesn't even tend to 0. Therefore $r \le \frac{1}{t-\epsilon}$ for every $\epsilon > 0$ , whence $r\le \frac{1}{t}$. This concludes the proof for $t \ne 0,\infty$. For the first highlighted part, I don't understand where the geometric series part comes from. 
$\sum{|a_n||z^n|} \le \sum{(1+\epsilon)^n\frac{1}{(t+\epsilon)^n}} = \sum1$, am I doing this wrong? And on the second part why wouldn't the equality with $\frac{1}{t-\epsilon}$ make it converge? Thanks!","['power-series', 'complex-analysis', 'limsup-and-liminf']"

980129,Techniques to prove a function is uniformly continuous,"So I understand the definition of uniform continuity, but wanted some suggestions to prove that a function is or isn't uniformly continuous. I have looked ahead and have seen that if a function is continuous on a compact domain, then the function is also uniformly continuous. But for the purposes of the examples below, I cannot use compactness, or the fact that a function is uniformly continuous if it is continuous and has a bounded derivative. Here's one example:  prove $f(x)= \sqrt{x}$ is uniformly continuous on $(0, \infty)$ .
I have seen this question asked before on this forum, and the respondents used the traditional definition. Ie. they found a delta such that if $|x-y|<\delta$ , then $|\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{y}|< \epsilon$ . I was wondering if I could try this in a slightly different way. Suppose I prove that $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ , and the choice of $\delta$ doesn't depend on $x_0$ . After some scratch work, I proved that $f(x)$ is continuous at $x_0$ provided that $|x-x_0|< \min\{1,(\sqrt{x_0+1} + \sqrt{x_0})*\epsilon\}$ . Since $x_0$ is always greater than $0$ , we can say that $\delta= \min\{1, \epsilon\}$ . Because I proved that our choice of $\delta$ doesn't depend on $x_0$ , is this a valid proof that $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous? Here's another example: I want to prove that $f(x)=x^2$ is not uniformly continuous on $(0, \infty)$ . After some work, I proved that $f(x)$ is continuous at $x_0$ (in dom $f$ ), provided that $\delta< min \{1, \frac {\epsilon}{ (2x_0+1)}\}$ . Here, since our choice of delta does depend on $x_0$ , we can say the function is not uniformly continuous. So am I approaching these problems correctly? I realize that I have not been using the definition of uniformly continuity. (that if $f$ is uniformly continuous, then if $|x-y|<\delta$ , then $|f(x)-f(y)|< \epsilon$ . Also, sorry about the formatting. I realize I should learn proper formatting soon!.

What possible groups can $G$ be? If $P$ is a Sylow-$p$ subgroup of $G$, then the homomorphism $f: G\to P$ has a kernel $K$. which is complementary to $P$ (the intersection is trivial since $f$ restricts to the identity on $P$, and $\langle P, K\rangle=G$, since $f(g)\in H$ for all $g\in G$, so $g^{-1}f(g)\in K$. Note that $K$ is normal. Now applying the assumption to $K$, we get a complement to $K$ with is normal itself and a Sylow-$p$, so the Sylow-$p$ is unique and normal, and so $G$ is the direct product of its Sylow-$p$ subgroups. So now we just need to characterize the Sylow-$p$'s that satisfy this property, so now assume $G$ is a $p$-group. Let $H=Z(G)$. Then the deformation retraction homomorphism gives a normal complement to the center. But in a $p$-group, every nontrivial normal subgroup intersects the center nontrivially, so the complement to the center is trivial, so $G$ is abelian. Now, if $G$ has a cyclic subgroup $C$ of order $p^2$, then let $H$ be the order $p$ subgroup of this cyclic subgroup. Then a generator $x$ of $C$ can't map to the identity (otherwise all of $H$ would map to the identity), so it must map to a generator $y$ of $H$. But then $x^p$ would have to map to $y^p=1$, which is a contradiction, since $x^p\in H-\{1\}$ (it's in $H$ since it's the $p$th power of something in $C$, and it's not the identity, since $x\notin H$). Thus, $G$ cannot have a cyclic subgroup of order $p^2$, and thus must be elementary abelian. If so, then $G$ does in fact have this property, since it's just a vector space over $\mathbb F_p$, and you can just project onto any subspace. Therefore, the only $G$ with the deformation detraction property are those that are the direct products of prime cyclic groups. However, I was wondering if there were an elementary way to do this, since apparently, this problem was from before Sylow subgroups or the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups were covered.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"
980399,To show a morphism of affine k-varieties which is surjective on closed points is surjective,"This is a exercise from Ravi Vakil's Foundations of Algebraic Geometry , Ex 7.4.E. Assume Chevalley's theorem. Show that a morphism of affine $k$-varieties $\pi:X \rightarrow Y$ is surjective iff it is surjective on closed points (i.e. if every closed point of $Y$ is the image of a closed point of $X$). I want to show 'if' part. Since $X,Y$ are both $k$-varieties so $\pi$ is morphism of Noetherian scheme. By Chevalley's thm, $\pi(X)=\cup_{i=1}^{N}O_i\cap C_i$, where $O_i$ are open, $C_i$ are closed and $\{O_i \cap C_i\}$ are disjoint. Since $\pi$ is surjective on closed points, we know $\pi(X)$ is dense. If I can prove $\pi(X)$ is open, then I am done. Can anyone provide some hints for me?",['algebraic-geometry']

Now using this result, Rudin gives Theorem 3.29 on page 62, which states that If $p>1$ , $$\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n (\log n)^p} $$ converges; if $p \leq 1$ , the series diverges. Right after the proof of Theorem 3.29, Rudin states on page 63: This procedure may evidently be continued. For instance, $$\sum_{n=3}^\infty \frac{1}{n \log n \log \log n}$$ diverges, whereas $$\sum_{n=3}^\infty \frac{1}{n \log n (\log \log n)^2}$$ converges. How do we derive these last two divergence and convergence conclusions

Taking two closed sets $A,B\subseteq X$, I'd like to find two open sets $\hat A, \hat B$  such that: $A\subseteq \hat A$ $B \subseteq \hat B$ $\hat A \cap \hat B = \emptyset $ I thought to somehow divide $A$ and $B$ to sub-sets, such that: $A_1$ consists of elements of $A$ that have a successor and a predecessor $A_2$ consists of elements of $A$ that have a successor and dont have a predecessor $A_3$ consists of elements of $A$ that dont have a successor and have a predecessor (this case is symmetric to case $2$) $A_4$ consists of elements of $A$ that dont have either a successor nor a predecessor And same for $B$. Then I know all elements of $A_1$ and $B_1$ are open sets (every singleton $\{x \}$ where $x\in A_1$), and for $A_2$ and $A_3$ I think I can find open sets that will still have no common elements with $B$, but didn't write it formally yet (still in my head), so not sure I'll actually be able to do so. But asides form that, what bothers me is $A_4$, which I have no idea how to handle.

980676,Repairing solutions in ODE,"Recently I encounter something interesting that I hope to hear from your opinions: Suppose we are given a ODE $\frac{dy}{dx}=y$, with no initial condition. Naively, we divide both sides by $y$ and use the separation of variables. (This is a very typical mistake that many high school students will commit, I myself did commit such an error back then :P) We will get a general solution: $y=A\exp(x)$. We can plot the trajectories out by varying the value of $A$. If the initial condition is to be $y(0)=0$, then again, naively we substitute into the $y=A\exp(x)$, hence yielding $A=0$, which means $y$ is identically equals to $0$. I know the naive steps involved are incorrect, especially the one that involves division by $y$ throughout. But at the end of the day, the general solution seems to have the ability of ""repairing"" this mistake by allowing $A=0$. However, when the ODE changes to the following: $\frac{dy}{dx}=y(y-1)$. Then I encounter difficulty in ""repairing"" the solution. According to my working, the general solution is $y=\frac{1}{1-A\exp(x)}$. I can ""repair"" the mistake made for initial condition $y(0)=1$ by setting $A=0$, but I cannot ""repair"" the result for the initial condition $y(0)=0$. I have a hunch that these might be related to the attracting/repelling orbits/trajectories. From the plotting of the trajectories for these two questions, I notice that those trajectories that I can ""repair"" the solution are repelling trajectories. Perhaps I am thinking too much.
