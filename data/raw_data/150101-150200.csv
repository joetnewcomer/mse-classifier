2494916,Consequences of the Classification of Finite Simple Groups,"There are many conjectures in finite group theory which were solved thanks to the Classification theorem. Here are some of the most famous ones ( $S$ will always be a non-abelian finite simple group): Schreier's conjecture: $\operatorname{Out}(S)$ is solvable. Ore's conjecture: every element of $S$ is a commutator. The only 4- and 5-fold transitive permutation groups are the symetric alternating, and Mathieu groups. Do you know any other examples of this?","['conjectures', 'finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'simple-groups', 'group-theory']"
2494926,Non-trivial faces of the closed convex hull of a non-convex closed set with connected complement,"I'm trying to prove or disprove a problem, but I'm struggling to make headway. Any help is appreciated. Suppose $X$ is a Hilbert Space, and $C \subseteq X$ is closed, bounded, non-convex, and $X \setminus C$ is connected. Does the boundary of $\operatorname{conv} C$ necessarily contain a line segment? The following are my thoughts on the problem: The connectedness and openness of the complement gives us an open subset of the boundary of $\operatorname{conv} C$ that doesn't intersect $C$. The Bishop-Phelps theorem tells us that support points are dense in the boundary of convex sets, so there must exist support points of $\overline{\operatorname{conv}} C$ that aren't contained in $C$. If we choose one such point, by translation, we can say it is $0$ without loss of generality. If this point is not extreme in $\overline{\operatorname{conv}} C$, then we are done. However, such points can be extreme (e.g. take $C$ to be the standard orthonormal basis in $l^2$, in which case $0$ is such a point). I decided to look at the tangent cone of $\overline{\operatorname{conv}} C$ from the point $0$. I then picked a support point $x$ of this cone, other than $0$, but close enough that we could guarantee that it would not be in $C$. The supporting hyperplane must support the set $\overline{\operatorname{conv}} C$ at $0$. I'm hoping to show that $x \in \overline{\operatorname{conv}} C$. This is where I get stuck. If the functional that supports at $x$ achieves its maximum on $C$, then I get to the result, but this may not be the case. Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.","['functional-analysis', 'convex-hulls', 'convex-analysis', 'hilbert-spaces']"

One thing I saw was that we could bound the second equation, such as : $$z' = (1 +z^2)^a \leq  (1+y^2 + z^2)^a = y/y'$$ since $y^2 \geq \forall y\in C(\mathbb R).$ So, we have that the second equation is bound between the solution and the derivative of the first equation, since : $$z \leq \frac{y}{y'}$$ but I cannot see how to use this in order to study the existence of the equation (it can maybe help on proving Lipschitz conditions for the uniqueness but that's not what I need here).","['dynamical-systems', 'stability-theory', 'systems-of-equations', 'stability-in-odes', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

a tight upper bound. Am I reading this correctly? 
(My knowledge of algebraic geometry is thin.) Q2 . My actual situation is that my curve $C$ is (a) connected, and

2495103,Does this modified notion of a limit have a name?,"Given a function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ between metric spaces, define: $$\mathop{\mathrm{clust}}_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = \left\{b \in Y : \forall \varepsilon>0\ \forall \delta>0\ \exists a' \in X\text{ s.t. }d_X(a',a)<\delta\text{ and }d_Y(fa',b)<\varepsilon)\right\}$$ So basically, it's like we're taking a limit, except that we can get more than one value.

Given $f(0)=f'(0)=1$ and $f''(x)>0$  for all $x\geq0$, then $f(2)>2$. Assume $f(x)$ is double differentiable for $x\geq0$. (The problem doesn't state much else so I'm assuming other conditions such as $f$ is a real-valued one variable function are implicit). ARGUMENT 1. Since $f''(x)>0$, then $f'(x)$ is increasing. Therefore $\qquad \qquad f'(x)\geq f'(0)=1$ $\qquad$for all $x\geq 0$.$\quad$ Then $$\int_{0}^{2} f'(x) dx \geq \int_{0}^{2} dx$$
$$f(2)-f(0) \geq 2$$ $$f(2) \geq 2+f(0)=3$$
Since $f(2) \geq 3$, it follows that $f(2)$ is strictly greater than 2. ARGUMENT 2 By the mean value theorem, it exists a $c\in (0,2)$ such that $$\frac{f(2)-f(0)}{2} =f'(c)  \geq1$$

I tried with several substitutions (apart $u=2x-1$ ), integration by parts, complex integration, derivation with respect to a parameter (""Feynman's trick""), exploiting the complex exponential as cosine/sine, but I believe that the main obstacle to a ""good"" substitution is the presence of the linear term $u$ in the complex exponential. I am interested in a closed form, if any. Update 1 By symmetry arguments and with the suggested substitution I got $$\int_0^{\pi/4}  (\cos \theta)^{n-2} e^{-2\pi(a^2+b^2)\cos^2 \theta} \cos(2\pi ab \sin(2\theta)) \mathrm{d}\theta$$ but I have no further ideas. I tried with several substitutions (log-tan, half-angle, etc.) but with no results. I think that some special function is involved (the last term calls for Bessel) but I am definitely not an expert. (See mathstackuser12's answer for a complete account on this). Update 2 Before assigning the bounty I would ask if a complex integration way could be fruitful: since $$\frac{1}{1+u^2} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{i}{u+i} - \frac{i}{u-i} \right)$$ and $$\overline{\frac{1}{u-i}}=\frac{1}{u+i}$$ we can write $$ \int_{0}^1 \frac{1}{(1+u^2)^{n/2}}\exp{\left(-2\pi (a-b)^2 \frac{1}{1+u^2}\right)} \exp{\left(-4\pi ab \frac{i}{u+i}\right)} $$ or $$ \int_{0}^1 \frac{1}{(1+u^2)^{n/2}} \exp{\left(\pi (a-b)^2 \frac{i}{u-i}\right)} \exp{\left(-(\pi(a-b)^2+4\pi ab)\frac{i}{u+i}\right)} \mathrm{d}u$$ and I wonder if there exists a useful path in the complex plane, surrounding a domain of analyticity (I tried without success), or if computing the residues in a smart way could be a good thing.‌","['calculus', 'complex-integration', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'special-functions']"

I understand this will involve build up counting, so we'll need to use $n \choose k$ for this problem. I've tinkered around with it and realized the sum of a string with the same value digit follows the following pattern: 999999… 54 888888… 48 777777… 42 666666… 36 555555… 30 444444… 24 So to get the sum to 27, we’d have to subtract 1 from some of the digits in the 555555 string 3 times, giving us some combination of 555444. If we do +/– some values on each digit, we can make the same combinations of 27. I just don't know how I can use $n \choose k$ on this pattern, where I use 555444 and its combinations +/- different values on each digit.

2495675,"If we can't Stieltjes integrate Brownian motion pathwise, then what do the values of the Ito integral represent?","The Ito integral strongly resembles the Stieltjes integral (in either Lebesgue or Riemann flavor), to the point that I would almost want to define $(\int_\text{Ito}X \, dM)(\omega)$ as the Stieltjes integral $\int X(\omega) \, dM(\omega)$. The problem of course is that when $M$ is the sort of stochastic process we're interested in, $M(\omega)$ is almost always a function of unbounded variation. The construction of the Ito integral somehow gets around this by defining itself on the entire probability space all at once, rather than trying to do it pointwise at each $\omega$. But where exactly the magic happens is mysterious to me. At the end of the construction, we somehow end up with a value $I(X,M)(\omega)$. If not the Stieltjes integral of $X$ against $M$, then what is that value? What does it represent? The whole thing reminds me conditional expectation.  We can't define conditional expectation at a point because we'd be trying to condition on an event of measure zero, but if we instead define it on the entire space all at once , via a kind of global property (it should integrate to something appropriate) then we make sense of the problem.

What is the key reason that every set has a closure but not an opsure? What is the key reason that every set has an interior but not a clinterior?"" First we define an open set: Given a set $X \subset \mathbb R$, $X$ is called open if $\forall_x \in X$, $x$ has an $\epsilon$-neighborhood which is contained in $X$. So an example of an open set is $(a,b)$. This is true $\forall_{a,b} \in \mathbb R$ given $a \neq b$. Additionally, $\emptyset$ and $\mathbb R$ are open sets. Likewise, we define a closed set: A set $Y$ is closed if it contains all its limit points. Or, we can say $Y$ is closed if and only if $Y^c$ is open. Examples of closed sets are $[c,d]$ and $\emptyset$ (it is only one of two sets that are both empty and closed! The other one being $\mathbb R$). Again, we assume $\forall_{c,d} \in \mathbb R$ and $c \neq d$. For the example of a set lacking the property of opsure: Given an open set $A$, the smallest open set containing $A$ is $A$ itself. So a set lacking opsure, call it $X$, is a set that is not the smallest set that contains itself. An example of this set would be $X = \mathbb R + (0,1)$ since $\mathbb R$ already contains the set $(0,1)$, thus the set $X$ lacks having the property of opsure as $X$ is not the smallest set that contains itself.

$$ \gamma :(a,b)\to\mathcal{M} $$

I want to compute the Galois groups $ G_{1}:=Gal(K/K_{1}),G_{2}:=Gal(K/K_{2}) $ as well as the intersection $ K_{3}:=K_{1} \cap K_{2} $ and $ G_{3}=Gal(K/K_{3}) $. First, I claim that $G_{1} \simeq C_{2} \times C_{2} $. To this end, define $$ \sigma_{1}: x \mapsto  1-x, y \mapsto y $$ and $$ \sigma_{2}: x \mapsto x, y \mapsto 1-y $$ Notice that both $ \sigma_{1} $ and $ \sigma_{2} $ are their own inverses and map the generators $ 4x(1-x) $ and $ 4y(1-y) $ of $ K_{1} $ to themselves so the $ \sigma_{i}'s $ induce $ K_{1} $-automorphisms of $ K $. Let $$ p_{1}(T):=(T-x)(T-\sigma_{1}(x))=T^{2}-(x+\sigma_{1}(x))T+x\sigma_{1}(x)=T^{2}-T+x(1-x) $$

Observe that $ p_{1}(T),p_{2}(T) \in K_{1}[T] $ and that $ p_{1}(x)=p_{2}(y)=0 $ so $ [K_{1}(x):K_{1}],[K_{1}(y):K_{1}] \leq 2 $. On the other hand, we can't have that $ [K_{1}(x):K]=1 $ or that $ [K_{1}(y):K]=1 $ as that would mean that $ x $ or $ y $ are in $ K $ which is false because of degree considerations. So $$ [K_{1}(x):K_{1}]=[K_{1}(y):K_{1}]=2 $$ Furthermore, we have that $$ [K_{1}(x,y):K_{1}]=[K_{1}(x,y):K_{1}(x)][K_{1}(x):K_{1}]=2[K_{1}(x,y):K_{1}(x)]=4 $$ as $ y \notin K_{1}(x) $ because of the same degree considerations. So we obtain that $ K $ is a degree $ 4 $ extension of $ K_{1} $ whose Galois group is generated by $ \sigma_{1} $ and $ \sigma_{2} $, each being non-trivial $ K_{1} $-automorphisms of $ K $ of order $ 2 $. Thus $ G_{1} \simeq C_{2} \times C_{2} $. I don't know how to go about computing $ G_{2},G_{3} $ and finding $ K_{3} $. Any help would be much appreciated.

2496441,Hilbert valued martingales - help with reference,"I'm currently studying the theory of SPDEs on the book ""Stochastic equations in infinite dimensions"" by da Prato, Zabczyk. In the book, the theory of stochastic processes with values on a Banach space $E$, and in the particular the notion of $E$-valued brownian motion, is also introduced. When the stochastic integral is constructed, it is defined only with respect to the brownian motion using a common approximation technique (it is firstly defined for elementary processes and then extended to the closure of these processes with respect to a suitable norm; after that it can be further extended by localization). However, when I was first introduced to stochastic analysis, it was done following the book ""Cntinuous martingales and brownian motion"" by Revuz, Yor, in which the (one dimensional) stochastic integral is defined for any continuous, square integrable martingale, and in particular it is shown the key result that $I_t=\int_0^t K_sdM_s$ is the unique process such that
$$ \langle I,N\rangle_t = \int_0^t K_s d\langle M,N\rangle_s$$
for any $N$ continuous, square integrable martingale, where $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle$ denotes the bracket process, or cross quadratic variation. My question is: can this result be extended to the general setting of $E$-valued martingales? (obviously one needs to define what is the integration with respect to the bracket in this case first) If so, do you know any books in which this is done? I made a few researches online and I found that some books approach stochastic integration in this setting using Doolean measures, which I don't know, so I'd prefer books that avoid using that kind of tool or introduce it softly before using it.","['stochastic-pde', 'banach-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'stochastic-integrals', 'stochastic-analysis']"

I think if you take a diamond packing (every node is connected to it's four nearest neighbour & the whole affair is highly regular), you could take the middle point of each edge and contruct a plane so that the edge cuts the plane at a right angle, these planes should make up such a tessalation ... exceot that if i try to visualize the this (in my head, my drawing/modelling skills are not up to the task), I arrive at tetraeders again which we know won't work - but maybe my visualization is wrong.

2496612,Inverse of partial derivative,"Good afternoon everyone, I'm posting a similar but different question with respect to this post . I have two vectors $a \in \mathbb{R}^M$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^N$. Assume that I know the partial derivative $\frac{\partial a}{\partial b} \in \mathbb{R}^{M\times N}$ and, from that, I would like to know its inverse $\frac{\partial b}{\partial a} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times M}$. Also assume that the functions are continuous and differentiable. I would like to know if there is a relationship between the two maps because I know that, if both vectors are of the same dimensions, it is valid that $\frac{\partial b}{\partial a} = \left(\frac{\partial a}{\partial b}\right)^{-1}$. In my case, do I have to use the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse? Or is there any more elegant solution? Moreover, I personally think it is wrong to adjust the previous computation for vectors. $\frac{\partial b_j}{\partial a} = \left(\frac{\partial a}{\partial b_j}\right)^{-1}$ for any component of $b$. Here I obtain a vector $\in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times M}$ that I should obtain with the pseudoinverse. I think that stacking these vectors ($j \in 1,\dots,N$) is different from the first solution I proposed at the beginning. I think this is wrong. Am I correct? I also think that computing $\frac{\partial b_j}{\partial a_i} = \left(\frac{\partial a_i}{\partial b_j}\right)^{-1}, \forall i \in \{1,\dots,M\}, j \in \{1,\dots,M\}$ and composing properly the derivative is wrong.

Am I right that this is wrong? Thank you in advance for any reply. Best regards,
Neostek P.S. just for knowledge, the reason for which the two vectors are of different dimensionality is that $a$ is a unit quaternion in $\mathbb{R}^4$ (even if it has a 1-dim constraint) while $b$ is a standard vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$.","['derivatives', 'vectors', 'partial-derivative', 'calculus']"

It basically suffices to check that the following inequalities are equivalent to each other: \begin{align*}
\binom nk &< \binom n{k+1} \\
\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} &< \frac{n!}{(k+1)!{(n-k-1)!}} \\
\frac{(k+1)!}{k!} &< \frac{(n-k)!}{(n-k-1)!}\\
k+1 &< n-k \\

From this we can see that this sequence is first increasing and then decreasing. (Such sequences are sometimes called unimodular.) And we also see that the maximum is attained in the middle.

$$yx\cdot y=y(xy)=y(yx^2)=y^2x^2$$ However, when I Googled groups of order 9 , it said there are only two groups of order 9 (up to isomorphism), and that they are both abelian. They are the cyclic group $\mathbb Z_9$ and the elementary abelian group $E_9 \cong \mathbb Z_3 \times \mathbb Z_3$. I must be missing something. What is wrong with my reasoning? If it helps, I got the conjugacy classes as $\{1\}$, $\{x,x^2\}$ and 
$\{y,yx,yx^2,y^2,y^2x,y^2x^2\}$.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

Hence we get:
$$

2x=A(2(x^2+y^2+z^2)(2x)-2x/a^2)+B\lambda,\\
2y=A(2(x^2+y^2+z^2)(2y)-2y/b^2)+B\mu,\\
2z=A(2(x^2+y^2+z^2)(2z)-2z/c^2)+B\gamma.

Somehow I need to eliminate $A$ and $B$, but the direct method is too lengthy.

Remark: The most common proof in the functional analysis books is the one found in this link . My intention is to carry out another proof using the fact that in all infinite dimensional vector normed space there is a  non-continuous linear form . My attepmt: We suppose that $E$ is infinite dimensional and $f:E\rightarrow \mathbb{K}$ is non-continuous linear form ($\mathbb{K}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$), an idea of the proof of the existence of this function can be found in this link . Since $f$ is discontinuous function then for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$ there exists $x_{n}\in E$ such that $\left\|x_{n}\right\|=1$ and $|f(x_{n})|>n$. Let $M_{n}=\mathrm{span}\left\{x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}\right\}$, since $M_{n}$ is finite dimensional, then $M_{n}$ is reflexive and $\left.f_{n}\right|_{M_{n}}$ is bounded, let $\alpha_{n}=\left\|\left.f_{n}\right|_{M_{n}}\right\|$. By Hahn-Banach theorem and the fact that $M_{n}$ is reflexive we can choose $y_{n}\in M_{n}$ such that $\left\|y_{n}\right\|=1$ and  $|f(y_{n})|=\alpha_{n}$. Therefore, $\left\{y_{n}\right\}\subseteq \overline{B_{1}(0)}$, If I can prove that $\left\{y_{n}\right\}$ does not have convergent subsequences or that it does not have Cauchy subsequences then the proof will have ended because $\overline{B_{1}(0)}$ would not be compact, which implies that $B_{1}(0)$ would not be precompact, which is a contradiction. The problem: I have not been able to demonstrate the final part of my proof proposal, although I'm not sure it's true either.","['functional-analysis', 'compactness']"

$$ \mathcal F(f(x))(z)=\hat f (z) = \prod_{m=1}^{\infty} \left(\cos\left(\frac{\pi z}{2^m}\right)\right)^m$$ A probabilistic formula regarding it says that it equals the cumulative distribution function of $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^{-n}\xi_n, \text{ where } \xi_n = U(0,1)$$ A functional equation is also given, which it fulfils: $$f'(x) = 2f(2x)$$ So now to the question ... given these equations, or what we can derive from them, what would be a practical approach to calculate function values on an equally spaced grid for this function? In other words to estimate $$f(\Delta_t n), \,\, \text{ where }\,\,\cases{ n= \{0,\cdots ,2^{m}-1\}\\ \Delta_t = 2^{-m}}$$ Bonus points for considering all in all computational resources required for the calculations.","['functional-analysis', 'computational-mathematics', 'probability', 'soft-question', 'analysis']"
