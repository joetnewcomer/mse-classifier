b&=\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{f(ax)-f(x)}{x}\\

1864119,Closed form of $\int_0^1 \tan(\gamma\sqrt{1-x^2}) dx$,"Some context: I'm studying the problem of nonperturbative pair creation from strong fields in quantum electrodynamics. For certain time dependent electric fields I can get some information about the qualitative behavior from integrals of the form
$$ \tilde{h}(\gamma) = \int_0^1 h(\gamma\sqrt{1-x^2}) dx, $$
where $h$ depends on the field profile and $\gamma$ is something like an inverse timescale (if $h$ has any poles, $\gamma$ is always restricted to an appropriate region). For $h=\sinh$, $h=\tanh^{-1}$ and $h=\mathrm{erfi}$ (the imaginary error function) Mathematica provides closed form solutions, but not for $h=\tan$, which I am greatly interested in. The only idea I had was expressing $h$ using its Taylor series and integrating term by term, which I can do because $$ \int_0^1 \gamma^n (1-x^2)^{n/2} dx = \gamma^n  \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \frac{\Gamma(1+n/2)}{\Gamma(3/2 + n/2)}, $$ and then sum up the resulting series. This again works for the other functions mentioned above, but not for the tangent. Any ideas how to get a closed form result of the integral for $h=\tan$? Edit: The results Mathematica is able to compute are:
$$ \text{for } h = \sinh: \quad\tilde{h}(\gamma) = \frac{\pi}{2} I_1(\gamma ), $$
$$ \text{for } h = \tanh^{-1}: \quad\tilde{h}(\gamma) = \frac{\pi}{2}\frac{1-\sqrt{1-\gamma ^2}}{ \gamma }, $$
$$ \text{for } h = \mathrm{erfi}: \quad\tilde{h}(\gamma) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi }\gamma}{2}  e^{\frac{\gamma ^2}{2}}  \left(I_0\left(\frac{\gamma ^2}{2}\right)-I_1\left(\frac{\gamma ^2}{2}\right)\right). $$","['physics', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'closed-form']"

Consider a solution of the form $\phi(x,y)=X(x)Y(y) \tag{2}$ $2$. Put it into the equation, assuming $X(x) \ne 0,$ and $Y(y) \ne 0$, to get $$\dfrac{\text{D}^2 X}{X}+\dfrac{\text{D}^2 Y}{Y}=0 \tag{3}$$ where $\text{D}$ is the differential operator. $3$.

1864166,Circle has smallest shadow to area ratio,"I believe and would like to show that for an arbitrary two-dimensional geometrical figure, the average (with respect to rotation) one-dimensional shadow that it casts is larger than the shadow of a circle of the same area. Just to clarify: Let us define the figure as a set of points in a (x,y) coordinate system. 
We confine the problem to closed and bounded sets, and it is easily seen that any non-convex set has a convex equivalent with the same shadow and larger area, so we only need to consider convex sets. The shadow with respect to a parallel vertical light source is the largest x-value in the set minus the smallest x-value in the set.
We now calculate the shadow for all rotations of the figure, and average the shadow as a function of the angle with uniform weight to all angles. For example, the shadow of a circle is its diameter, and the shadow of a rod with length $l$ is $l \sin \phi$, where $\phi$ is the angle between the rod and the y-axis.","['convex-geometry', 'geometry']"

1864176,How many subsets of $n$ linearly independent binary strings of length $n$?,"Let's consider binary words of length $n$ with elements {-1,1}. There are $2^n$ binary words of length $n$. Now let's consider a subset of $n$ such binary words. All possible subsets are $\binom{2^n}{n}$. These subsets might contains linearly independent or dependent words. For instance if $n = 2$ one has 6 possible subsets of 2 words of length 2. Two of them contain linearly dependent words: {(1,1),(-1,-1)} and {(1,-1),(-1,1)}. The other four are made up of linearly independents words. In general one can check linear dependency by evaluating the determinant of the square matrix whose rows are the binary words (In the example the determinant is zero in the first case, and different from zero in the other cases). Is there a way to evaluate the number of subsets containing linearly dependent words for a generic $n$? The absolute value of the determinant of {-1,1} matrices range from 0 to a maximum value $2^{n−1}\cdot D(n)$ (see Hadamard largest determinant problem) by steps of $2^{n−1}$. Here the problem is to find how many of these subsets have null determinant.

1864244,Matrix decomposition into square positive integer matrices,"This is an attempt at an analogy with prime numbers. Let's consider only square matrices with positive integer entries. Which of them are 'prime' and how to decompose such a matrix in general? To illustrate, there is a product of two general $2 \times 2$ matrices: $$AB=\left[ \begin{matrix} a_{11} &  a_{12} \\  a_{21} &  a_{22} \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} b_{11} &  b_{12} \\  b_{21} &  b_{22} \end{matrix} \right]=\left[ \begin{matrix} a_{11} b_{11}+a_{12} b_{21} &  a_{11} b_{12}+a_{12} b_{22} \\  a_{21} b_{11}+a_{22} b_{21} &  a_{21} b_{12}+a_{22} b_{22} \end{matrix} \right]$$ Exchanging $a$ and $b$ we obtain the expression for the other product $BA$. Now, if we allow zero, negative and/or rational entries we can probably decompose any matrix in an infinite number of ways. However, if we restrict ourselves: $$a_{jk},~b_{jk} \in \mathbb{N}$$ The problem becomes well defined. Is there an algorithm to decompose an arbitrary square positive integer matrix into a product of several positive integer matrices of the same dimensions? There is a set of matrices which can'be be decomposed, just like the prime numbers (or irreducible polynomials, for example). The most trivial one is (remember, zero entries are not allowed): $$\left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 1 \\  1 &  1 \end{matrix} \right]$$ There are no natural numbers $a_{11},b_{11},a_{12},b_{21}$, such that: $$a_{11} b_{11}+a_{12} b_{21}=1$$ The same extends to any dimension $d$. Any 'composite' $d \times d$ matrix will have all entries $ \geq d$. Thus, for square matrices we can name several more 'primes': $$\left[ \begin{matrix} 2 & 1 \\  1 &  1 \end{matrix} \right],~~~\left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 2 \\  1 &  1 \end{matrix} \right],~~~\left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 1 \\  2 &  1 \end{matrix} \right],~~~\left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 1 \\  1 &  2 \end{matrix} \right],~~~\left[ \begin{matrix} 2 & 2 \\  1 &  1 \end{matrix} \right],~~~\left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 1 \\  2 &  2 \end{matrix} \right], \dots$$ And in general, any matrix which has at least one entry equal to $1$. It makes sense, that most entries in 'composite' matrices will be large, since we are multiplying and adding natural numbers. For example: $$\left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &  2 &  4 \\  3 &  3 &  1 \\  3 &  4 &  4 \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} 2 &  5 &  5 \\  4 &  5 &  5 \\  5 &  1 &  4 \end{matrix} \right]=\left[ \begin{matrix} 30 &  19 &  31 \\  23 &  31 &  34 \\  42 &  39 &  51 \end{matrix} \right]$$ $$\left[ \begin{matrix} 2 &  5 &  5 \\  4 &  5 &  5 \\  5 &  1 &  4 \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &  2 &  4 \\  3 &  3 &  1 \\  3 &  4 &  4 \end{matrix} \right] =\left[ \begin{matrix} 32 &  39 &  33 \\  34 &  43 &  41 \\  20 &  29 &  37 \end{matrix} \right]$$ If no decomposition algorithm for this case exists, is it at least possible to recognize a matrix that can't be decomposed according to the above rules?","['diophantine-equations', 'matrices', 'prime-factorization', 'matrix-decomposition', 'linear-algebra']"
1864278,Inverse Mills ratio for non normal distributions.,"We have the well known result of the inverse Mills ratio:
$$ \mathbb{E}[\,X\,|_{\ X > k} \,] = 
            \mu + \sigma \frac {\phi\big(\tfrac{k-\mu}{\sigma}\big)}{1-\Phi\big(\tfrac{k-\mu}{\sigma}\big)},$$
where $\phi(.)$ and $\Phi(.)$ are the PDF and CDF of the Gaussian distribution respectively.
The literature seems to confine this ratio to the Gaussian. Are there results for other, more general classes of distributions? For instance, can one derive it for the general Pearson class class of distributions defined as $$f'(x)=-\frac{\left(a_1 x+a_0\right) }{b_2 x^2+b_1 x+b_0}f(x),$$ and express it as a function of parameters? $\textbf{Added:}$
We can derive the inverse Mills ratio as follows. Let $f(.)$ and $F(.)$ be the PDF and CDF, respectively, for a generic distribution with infinite support on the right and $\overline{F}(.)=1-F(.)$. Since $\mathbb{E}(X|_{\ X > k }) = \frac{\int_k^\infty x f(x) \,dx}{\int_k^\infty f(x) \,dx}$, and integrating the numerator by parts :
$$\int_k^\infty x f(x) \,dx= -k\, \overline{F}(k)+\int_k^\infty \overline{F}(x) \,\mathrm{d} x,$$
we get:
$$ \mathbb{E}(X|_{ X > k}) = 
            -k+ \frac{\int_k^\infty \overline{F}(x) \,\mathrm{d} x}{\overline{F}(k)}.$$ Now the idea is to generalize from this equation. $\textbf{Note:}$ For a Gaussian $\int_k^\infty \overline{F}(x) \,\mathrm{d} x=\frac{1}{2} (\mu -k) \left(1-\text{erf}\left(\frac{k-\mu }{\sqrt{2} \sigma }\right)\right)+\sigma \phi(\frac{k-mu}{\sigma})$.","['probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation', 'normal-distribution', 'probability-distributions']"

I need to check if $$\frac{1}{\pi(N)}\sum_{p\leq N}e^{2\pi i m p^{1/p}}$$ tends to zero as $N\to\infty$, $\forall m\neq 0$, where we are denoting the prime-counting function by $\pi(x)$ and $p$ the sequence of prime numbers in increasing order. I take the definition following the teacher in this video of the more high quality, to do the calculation $$L(s,\psi_m)=\prod_{p}\left(1-\frac{p^{\frac{2\pi i m}{p}}}{p^s}\right)^{-1}=\zeta(s-\frac{2\pi i m}{p}).$$ Now I believe that it is required to say that one has a pole at $s=1+\frac{2\pi i m}{p}$ (notice that I believe that I have a sequence of poles, Murty's example only depends on $m$), and say that I can use the theorem to show that our sum $\rightarrow 0$ as $N\to\infty$, thus our sequence is equidistributed in the (compact) group $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. Can you explain if it is feasible such calculations or do it? I don't understand well if it is possible to  apply the theorem for my example, if you can state in details how one can use the theorem, then it is the best, and this example will be here as a reference.

1864918,"Real Analysis, Folland 3.25 Exampes Functions of Bounded Variation","Background Information: Taking $a = -\infty$ and considering the total variation as a function of $b$ . To with $F:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and $x\in\mathbb{R}$ , we define $$T_F(x) = \sup\{\sum_{1}^{n}|F(x_j) - F(x_{j-1}|:n\in\mathbb{N},-\infty < x_0 < \ldots < x_n = x\}$$ $T_F$ is called the total variation of $F$ . We observe that the sums in the definition of $T_F$ are made bigger if the additional subdivision points $x_j$ are added. Hence, if $a < b$ , the deinition of $T_F(b)$ is unaffected if we assume that $a$ is always one of the subdivision points. It follows that $$T_F(b) - T_F(a) = \sup\{\sum_{1}^{n}|F(x_j) - F(x_{j-1}|:n\in\mathbb{N},a = x_0 < \ldots < x_n = b\}$$ Thus $T_F$ is an increasing function with values in $[0,\infty]$ . If $T_F(\infty) = \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}T_F(x)$ is finite, we say that $F$ is of bounded variation on $\mathbb{R}$ , and we denote the space of all such $F$ by $BV$ . More generally, the supremum on the right side is called the total variation of $F$ on $[a,b]$ . It depends only on the values of $F$ on $[a,b]$ , so we may define $BV([a,b])$ to be the set of all functions on $[a,b]$ whose total variation on $[a,b]$ is finite. Question: I have been working on these examples today and I am sort of stuck at for c,d,and e. I will provide the proofs I made for a and b just because. 3.25 Examples: a.) If $F:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is bounded and increasing, then $F\in BV$ (in fact, $T_F(x) = F(x) - F(-\infty)$ ). b.) If $F,G\in BV$ and $a,b\in\mathbb{C}$ , then $aF + bG\in BV$ . c.) If $F$ is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ and $F'$ is bounded, then $F\in BV([a,b])$ for $-\infty < a < b < \infty$ (by MVT). d.) If $F(x) = \sin x$ , then $F\in BV([a,b])$ for $-\infty < a < b < \infty$ , but $F\notin BV$ . e.) If $F(x) = x\sin(x^-1)$ for $x\neq 0$ and $F(0) = 0$ , then $F\notin BV([a,b])$ for $a\leq 0 < b$ or $a < 0\leq b$ . Proof a.) - If $F:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and $x\in\mathbb{R}$ , then $$T_F(x) = \sup\{\sum_{1}^{n}|F(x_j) - F(x_{j-1}|):n\in\mathbb{N}, -\infty < x_0 < \ldots < x_n = x \}$$ Since $F$ is increasing, the intervals $(F(x^-1),F(x^+) (x\in\mathbb{R})$ are disjoint, and for $|x| < N$ they lie in the interval $(F(-N),F(N))$ . Hence $$\sum_{|x| < N}|F(x^{+} - F(x^{-1}| \leq F(N) - F(-N) < \infty$$ so now we know $F$ is finite, therefore the total variation of $F$ is also finite, therefore $$\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow \infty}T_F(x) = T_F(\infty)\Rightarrow F\in BV$$ Proof b.) - Since $F,G\in BV \Rightarrow \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}T_F(x) = T_F(\infty)$ and $\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}T_G(x) = T_G(\infty)$ since $a,b$ are just scalars it follows that $$\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} aT_F(x) + bT_G(x) = aT_F(\infty) + bT_G(\infty) \Rightarrow aF + bG\in BV$$ Questions for c.) Since we know $F$ is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ and $F'$ is bounded we can conclude that $F$ is uniformly continuous. Therefore, it seems to me to complete this proof we have to assume that $F$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ then we can apply the Mean Value theorem. But I am not sure how we show finiteness to conclude that $F\in BV([a,b])$ . Questions for d.) Since $F(x) = sin(x)$ we know that $F$ is then continuous and I guess based on c.)

Then $\pi_*\mathcal{O}_C$ is locally free of finite rank. The proof boils down to showing that $C'$ is a regular integral affine curve $\operatorname{Spec}(A')$ and $C$ = $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ , then for any maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A'$ , $A_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is a free $A_{\mathfrak{m}}$ module. $A'_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is a DVR, so we may take a uniformiser $t$ and it suffices to prove the case where $t \in A'$ . Then since $A_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is a finitely generated $A'_{\mathfrak{m}}$ module, it is a direct sum of a free module and modules of the form $A'_{\mathfrak{m}}/(t^n)$ for some $n$ . But if there were any components of the latter form, then the image of $t$ in $A$ would be a zero divisor. The part that I don't understand is what follows, he says that, since any zero divisor is contained in some associated prime, there is some associated point of $C$ in $\pi^{-1}([\mathfrak{m}])$ , which contradicts the fact that $C$ has no embedded points. Firstly, I don't understand why the fact that we know the image of $t$ is contained in an associated prime of $C$ means that we know that there is an associated point in the fibre. Is it the case that any prime containing the image of $t$ maps to $[\mathfrak{m}]$ ? Certainly any such prime maps to a prime containing $t$ , but is $\mathfrak{m}$ the only one?. Secondly, why couldn't a generic point of $C$ map to $[\mathfrak{m}]$ ? I know that continuity would imply that everything in that component would then also map to $[\mathfrak{m}]$ , but I'm not sure why this couldn't happen. I thought it might have something to do with the fact that finite morphisms have finite fibres, so this component must be finite, but there also exist curves with finitely many points so I don't think this leads anywhere.","['curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1864972,Relation between semiring of sets and semiring in abstract algebra.,"Let a $\mathcal R$ be a family of subsets in $\Omega$ that is closed under finite union and relative complement. We say that $\mathcal R$ is a ring of sets in $\Omega$. Symbolically, for any $A,B\in\mathcal R$ we have

1865008,A trigonometric problem when calculating distance to the boundary of a convex hull,"Suppose we have a sphere and a point outside of the sphere. We denote the point outside as $v$ and the origin of the sphere as $x$. The convex hull of the sphere and $v$ should be like an ice cream cone. So for a point inside of the convex hull, say $u$, I want to prove that the distance to the boundary of the convex hull can be solved by a reduced problem where we consider only the part of the plane intersecting the convex hull containing points $x, u, v$. 
The reduced problem is illustrated in the figure. Basically, the question is: Does this restriction to the plane give the shortest distance to the boundary of the convex hull? How can we prove it? This seems like a trivial fact but it does not seem like that easy to prove... From any other ray propagated from $v$ on the convex hull, we draw a segment from u perpendicular to it. Let the distance between $v$ and $u$ be $L$, and the angle between $\overline{vu}$ and the two rays be $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively. Since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ must be in $(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$, and length of the two distances we need to compare is $L\sin{\alpha}$ and $L\sin{\beta}$.

1865020,How does a complex algebraic variety know about its analytic topology?,"This question has two parts. The first is a reference request regarding a result I assume is standard, and the second is a soft question asking for philosophy and intuition about an issue the first question raises for me. Apologies in advance that it might be hard to answer completely. Nonetheless I expect and hope that both the question and any answers will be interesting and useful to denizens of the site. Part 1: the analytic topology is an isomorphism invariant, right? Let $V,W$ be affine algebraic sets (i.e. vanishing sets of ideals of polynomials) embedded in $\mathbb{C}^m,\mathbb{C}^n$ respectively, and suppose there exists an isomorphism $f:V\rightarrow W$ of algebraic varieties. If $V,W$ are equipped with their subspace topologies as subspaces of the Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{C}^m$ and $\mathbb{C}^n$ , is $f$ necessarily a homeomorphism? I assume that the answer is yes and that this is a standard fact, since it seems to me it should be necessary in order to define the analytic topology on a general complex analytic variety. (If the answer is not ""yes"", then ""the analytic topology"" is meaningless because it would depend on choices of coordinates.) On the other hand, it is not obvious to me, because the analytic/Euclidean topology on an algebraic subset of $\mathbb{C}^n$ is so much finer than its Zariski topology. How does knowing that $f$ is an algebraic isomorphism allow us to control all the extra data in the analytic topology? This last question suggests the broader inquiry of part 2 to me - Part 2: how does the algebraic variety know about its analytic topology? This is the soft question. If two complex algebraic sets can't be isomorphic as varieties without being homeomorphic as subsets of Euclidean space, this suggests that their structure as algebraic varieties ""knows something"" about this finer topology. In fact, the variety must in some sense ""know"" the entire analytic topology, as it can be recovered by embedding into affine space, endowing the latter with the Euclidean topology, and taking the subspace topology. Given this - Where in the data defining the variety (the Zariski topology + the structure sheaf) does the data defining the analytic topology hide? In other words, it must be that given a subset $U$ of a complex algebraic variety $V$ , one can test whether $U$ is open for the analytic topology using only the data contained in $V$ 's Zariski topology and structure sheaf - What is the test? Addendum 7/21: Hoot's comment and KReiser's answer have clarified for me an aspect of Part 2 that I would like to make explicit. As I insinuated at the beginning of part 2, although given a complex algebraic variety (i.e. scheme of finite type over $\mathbb{C}$ ), one can recover the analytic topology by embedding its affines individually in complex affine space and taking the subspace topology, I am somehow unsatisfied by this as an explanation of how the variety knows about its analytic topology. Hoot's comment and KReiser's answer clarify for me why I am unsatisfied: what this is doing, philosophically, is using the sections of the structure sheaf to ""carry"" the analytic topology on $\mathbb{C}^n$ back to the variety, using the fact that the sections can be thought of as functions to $\mathbb{C}$ . The reason I wasn't satisfied with this (and hence asked the part 2 question) is that the analytic topology on $\mathbb{C}^n$ is data that lies outside the data that defines the variety. Hence, I would like to know if there is a way to test $U\subset V$ for analytic openness that can query any info contained in the data defining $V$ (its Zariski topology and structure sheaf, i.e. the $\mathbb{C}$ -algebra structure of its rings of sections and the restriction maps) but never queries whether or not a subset of any $\mathbb{C}^n$ is analytically open. Is there a test as above that does not consult the a-priori-known analytic topology on $\mathbb{C}$ ? Another way to sharpen the question: KReiser's answer shows that the reason that the analytic topology is an isomorphism invariant is essentially that polynomials are continuous. (KReisner noted even analyticity, so that an algebraic isomorphism is also an analytic isomorphism, but the only feature needed to conclude it's a homeomorphism is continuity.) Now any topology on $\mathbb{C}$ induces one on $\mathbb{C}^n$ , and we can ask with respect to any such topology whether polynomial functions $\mathbb{C}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^m$ are continuous. If they are, the exact same proof shows that the given topology is an isomorphism invariant of affine complex algebraic varieties, and thus can be imposed in a well-defined way on an arbitrary variety. The Zariski and analytic topologies are two such topologies. The latter is a refinement of the former. Can we say anything about the family of topologies described in the last paragraph? How big is it? What do they have in common? Can any of them be recovered from the data defining the variety, without a priori knowledge of the topology? [Obv. the Zariski topology can, because it is part of the data defining the variety.]","['complex-geometry', 'reference-request', 'soft-question', 'algebraic-geometry']"

The question is : If $\sum u_n$ is a divergent series of positive real numbers and $s_n = u_1 + u_2 + \dots + u_n$ , prove that the series $\sum \frac {u_n} {s_n}$ is divergent. I tried my best. But I failed. Please help me by giving me a hint. Thank you in advance. My solution : Let $\{t_n\}$ be the sequence of partial sums of the series $\sum \frac {u_n} {u_1 +u_2 + \dots +u_n}$. Let $s_n=u_1 +u_2+ \dots +u_n$. If we can prove that $\{t_n\}$ is not Cauchy then our purpose will be served. For this we have to show that $\exists \epsilon>0$ such that $\forall n \in \mathbb N, \exists p \in \mathbb N$ for which $t_{n+p}-t_n \geq \epsilon$. Now since $\sum u_n$ is divergent, then so is $\{s_n\}$. Hence $\forall n \in \mathbb N, \exists q \in \mathbb N$ such that $s_{n+q}>2s_n$. Now, $t_{n+q}-t_n= \frac {u_{n+1}} {s_{n+1}} + \frac {u_{n+2}} {s_{n+2}} + \dots + \frac {u_{n+q}} {s_{n+q}} > \frac {u_{n+1} +u_{n+2}+\dots +u_{n+q}} {s_n} > \frac {s_{n+q} -s_n} {s_n} >1$ which proves that $\{t_n\}$ is not a Cauchy sequence, hence the series $\sum \frac {a_n} {s_n}$ is divergent.","['sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification']"

Assume every point in $M$ has a unique minimizing geodesic connecting it to $p$. Is it true that for every point, the only geodesic connecting it to $p$ is the minimizing one? (Does the answer change if we count periodic geodesic as one?) Remarks: (1) In all the examples I have checked so far this holds. Of course, if for some $q \in M$ there is a unique minimizing geodesic, it does not imply there is a unique geodesic from $p$ to $q$ (think of a circle). For spheres,tori,cylinders - the claim vacuously holds, since there is no point satisfying the hypothesis (every point has an ""antipodal"" point where there is more than one minimizing geodesic). (2) If the assertion is true , it implies something quite strong on manifolds where minimizing geodesics are always unique; By this answer such a manifold must be diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ (via at the exponential map). Actually, one can adapt the argument of that answer to see that if there is one such point $p$ (that minimizing geodesics from it to all other points are unique), then the manifold will be diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Thus, to refute the conjecture , it is enough to find a manifold with one such point which is not diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'geodesic']"

Let $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ differentiable in the closed interval $I$ (bounded or not), with $f(I) \subset I$, and let $g = f\circ f\circ \cdots \circ f = f^p$, where $\circ$ means composition. If $\lvert g'(x) \rvert \leq c < 1, \forall x\in I$ where $c$ is a constant, show that there is only one $a\in I$ such that $f(a) = a$. Some thoughts I proved it for $p=1$, i.e. $g = f$ and $\lvert g'(x) \rvert = \lvert f'(x) \rvert \leq c < 1$. Notice that $I$ can be unbounded so the existence of the fixed point is not trivial. For the task, I use two results: Let $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ differentiable in the interval $I$. The function $f$ satisfies $\lvert f(x) - f(y) \rvert \leq c\lvert x - y \rvert$ for all $x,y\in I$ if and only if $\lvert f'(x) \rvert \leq c$ for all $x\in I$. Let $0\leq c < 1$. If the sequence $(x_n)$ is such that $\lvert x_{n+2} - x_{n+1}\rvert \leq c\lvert x_{n+1} - x_n\rvert $ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then the sequence $(x_n)$ converges. Now take any point $x_0\in I$ and build the following sequence: $x_1 = g(x_0), x_2 = g(x_1), \cdots, x_n = g(x_{n-1}), \cdots$. Since $\lvert g'(x) \rvert \leq c$, from result 1 we have $\lvert g(x_{n+1}) - g(x_{n}) \rvert \leq c\lvert x_{n+1} - x_{n} \rvert$, then $\lvert x_{n+2} - x_{n+1} \rvert \leq c\lvert x_{n+1} - x_{n} \rvert$. Since $0\leq c < 1$, from result 2 we have $(x_n)\to a$. Since $I$ is closed, $a\in I$. Finally, since $x_n = g(x_{n-1})$, this means $g(a) = a$. The uniqueness comes from supposing another $b$ and applying IVT to get contradiction. I am having trouble trying to prove for $p > 1$.

1865453,Integration of Hilbert space valued mappings.,"TL;DR: Is there a version of the Bochner integral which allows for the integration of isometric embeddings $\phi:X\to H$ from a metric space to a Hilbert space, satisfying $\int_X \|\phi\| d\mu < \infty$ for finite Borel measures $\mu$? I'm reading the article Distance covariance in metric spaces . The author considers (p. 9-11) an isometric embedding $\phi:(X,d^{1/2})\to H$, where $(X,d)$ is a metric space and $H$ is a Hilbert space. That is $\phi$ is an injective and continuous mapping satisfying
$$
d(x,y) = \| \phi(x)-\phi(y)\|^2 \quad \quad \forall x,y\in X.
$$ 
Then the author uses the following integral without further explanation
$$
\int_X \phi(x)  \,d\mu (x),
$$
where $\mu$ is a finite signed Borel measure on $(X,\mathcal{B}(X))$ satisfying
$$
\int_X d(x,o)  \,d|\mu|(x)< \infty.
$$
for some $o\in X$. I have not encountered the integration of Hilbert space valued mappings before, but after further invesigation I stumbled upon the theory of integration of Banach space valued mappings by the Bochner integral. Hence we want to show that both
$$
\int_X \phi(x)  \,d\mu^- (x) \quad \text{ and } \quad \int_X \phi(x)  \,d\mu^+ (x),
$$ 
exists. In order for these integrals to exist the mapping $\phi$ needs to be $\mu^{\pm}$-Bochner integrable and satisfy
$$
\int_X \|\phi(x)\| \, d \mu^{\pm}(x) < \infty.
$$
Now it is easily verified by the triangle inequality that
$$
\int_X \|\phi(x)\|  \,d |\mu|(x) \leq \int d(x,o)  \,d|\mu|(x) + \|\phi(o)\|\, |\mu|(X) < \infty,
$$
so it suffices to show that $\phi$ is $\mu^{\pm}$-Bochner integrable which by the Pettis measurability theorem holds if $\phi$ is $\mu^{\pm}$-almost surely separably valued and $\mathcal{B}(X)/\mathcal{B}(H)$-measurable. Continuity of $\phi$ yields the Borel-measurability but as far as i can see there is no way to guarantee that an isometric embedding $\phi$ into a Hilbert space  is $\mu^{\pm}$-almost surely separable valued for all finite signed Borel measures satisfying the above condition. Hence the question: Are my findings correct, in that there is no way to guarantee $\mu^{\pm}$-Bochner measurability of $\phi$, and in that case is there an extension/version of the Bochner integral for Hilbert space valued mappings which does not require such strict measurability conditions? The only requirement for the integral is that it should satisfy the condition
$$
\int f\circ \phi \, d\mu = f \left( \int \phi  \,d\mu  \right),
$$
for $f\in H^*$, that is $f:H\to\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous linear functional. Or at the very least
$$
\left\langle \int \phi \, d\mu ,h \right\rangle = \int \langle \phi(x) ,h \rangle  \,d\mu(x),

Surprisingly enough Mathematica can't take the integrals themselves, and numerically for $\vartheta_2(0,q),\vartheta_3(0,q)$ they are extremely hard to compute because of the sharp increase around $q=1$ . Using the same method, it's possible to find some other interesting integrals, for example: $$\int_0^1 \vartheta_2(0,q) \ln \frac{1}{q} dq=\frac{\pi}{2} \left( \tanh \pi-\frac{\pi}{\cosh^2 \pi} \right)$$ $$\int_0^1 \vartheta_3(0,q) \ln \frac{1}{q} dq=\frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{1}{ \tanh \pi}+\frac{\pi}{\sinh^2 \pi} \right)$$ $$\int_0^1 \vartheta_4(0,q) \ln \frac{1}{q} dq=\frac{\pi}{2 \sinh \pi} \left( \frac{\pi}{ \tanh \pi}+1 \right)$$ Where can I find out more about the integral identities for the Jacobi Theta Functions?

Let $P\in Y$. If $P\notin Z$ there is a polynomial $f\in \mathfrak{a}$ for which $f(P)\neq 0$. Let $H = Z(f)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^n$. Then $P\in Y-Y\cap H$ is open in $Y$ and closed in $\mathbb{A}^n - H$, the latter an affine variety. Thus $Y-Y\cap H$ is the desired open neighborhood. $\textit{The problem}$: $Y-Y\cap H = (\mathbb{A}^n - H)\cap Y$. We know $Y$ is open in $\overline{Y}$, and if $Y-Y\cap H$ were closed in that subspace then we should be able to express it as the intersection with a closed set. I'm just not sure why it is closed. If $\overline{Y}=\mathbb{A}^n$, then $Y=\mathbb{A}^n - Z(T)$ is a standard open set, hence quasi-affine variety, and $Y-Y\cap H$ would therefore be open in $\mathbb{A}^n$ by defintion of the subspace topology.","['birational-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

Since $(x_n)$ is Cauchy, so for $\epsilon_1$ there is an integer $N_1\in\mathbb{N}$, such that for any $j,m\geq N_1$, we have $d(x_m,x_j)<\epsilon_1.$ Now define a subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ of $(x_n)$ such that: $x_{n_1}=x_{N_1},\: x_{n_2}=x_{N_1+1}$ and so on. Obviously, the subsequence $(x_{n_k})$ is Cauchy.
