904827,"How to prove that $\frac{a+b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab}$ for $a,b>0$? [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Proving the AM-GM inequality for 2 numbers $\sqrt{xy}\le\frac{x+y}2$ (5 answers) Closed 8 years ago . I am reading a chapter about mathematical proofs. As an example there is:
Prove that: $$(1) \space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space \frac{a+b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab}$$ for $a,b>0$. There is stated that the thesis for the proof is short multiplication formula: $$(2)\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$$ Substracting from the short multiplication $(2)$ formula $4ab$  and using square root yields the proof by implication. (here ends the example in a book) Please tell me if I am right about it: we are considering only $a,b \in \Re^+$ $(1)$ can be transformed into $a-2\sqrt{ab}+b \geq0$ which is an equivalent short multiplication formula $(x-y)^2=x^2-2xy+y^2$ taking into account assumptions squared number is always equal or greater than zero. the implication says that if squared number is greater than zero then $(1)$ is true. My first question is: is my thinking proper? My other question is why the authors use $(a+b)^2$ and susbstract $4ab$ instead of starting with $(a-b)^2$. I am also confused about the symbols used - in $(1)$ and $(2)$ authors used $a$ and $b$ - is this just coincidence? Or this would be OK as well if in the first and second $a$ and $b$ were the same numbers?","['inequality', 'algebra-precalculus', 'self-learning', 'elementary-number-theory', 'proof-verification']"
904828,Computing the derivative of a transformation matrix,"I am trying to find a geometric transformation between two images, where the transformation is a simple scaling matrix. So, if I denote the two image functions as $r$ and $f$ and the scaling matrix as $S$, I am trying to minimize the following cost function (CF) with respect to the scaling parameters: $$
CF = 0.5 * (r(x) - f(S(x)))^{2}
$$ So, I can take the derivative as follows: $$
CF' = (r(x) -f(S(x))) * f'(S(x)) * S'(x) 
$$ where $f'(S(x))$ is the gradient of the transformed $f$ image according to the scaling matrix and $S'(x)$ is the derivative of the scaling matrix with respect to the scaling parameters, which is simple to compute. Now, I have the following question: The image is sampled at various pixel locations and I can use this formula to compute the gradient of the cost function at every pixel location. However, if I want to get the global gradient. Should I sum up these individual gradients to get the global gradient to use in the optimisation?","['optimization', 'transformation', 'derivatives']"

904866,Relationship between Surface Area and Volume,"Question: Is there a general relationship between surface area and volume analogous to the below examples? Example 1. Consider a ball $B$ centered at the origin of a spherical coordinate system. The ball has volume $V(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the origin to the boundary $\partial B$ of the ball. Now consider the surface area of $\partial V$. Elementary geometry shows that $A(r) = 4 \pi r^2$. Comparing $A$ and $V$, it follows that $$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial r} = A.
$$ Example 2. Another simple example is an open cylinder of length $l$. Place the cylinder at the origin and then define $s$ as the radial distance from the origin (in cylindrical coordinates). The volume of the cylinder is $V(s) = \pi s^2 l$ and its surface area is $A(s) = 2 \pi s l$. Once again, we have a relationship between volume and surface area with reference to the variable of variation (e.g., $s$ is the variable of variation, since both the volume and cylinder share the common length $l$), $$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial s} = A.
$$ Example 3. Although a cube may seem to stray from this relationship, as $\partial_s (s^3) \neq 6s^2$, this is only due to the lack of symmetry. If we center the cube in a Cartesian coordinate system, and define $a$ to be half the side length $s$, we see that $V(a) = (2a)^3 = 8a^3$ and $A(a) = 6(2a)^2 = 24a^2$. Thus, $$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial a} = A.
$$ Now consider a region $Q \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ with boundary $\partial Q$. The ""center of mass"" is defined as $$
\textbf{r}_{cm} = \frac{1}{V(Q)} \int_{Q} \textbf{r} dV,
$$ where $\textbf{r} = (x, y, z)$ in Cartesian coordinates. Assume that the object is centered in a coordinate system such that $\textbf{r}_{cm} = \textbf{0}$. Now let a coordinate system be described by a basis $\{\textbf{x}_i\}$, where $i = 1, 2, 3$. In general, when will the following relationship hold between $V = V(Q)$ and $A(\partial Q)$, $$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial x_i} = A?
$$ Also, assuming this relationship holds in some coordinate system, is there only one associated region that satisfies the necessary conditions (e.g., a sphere in spherical coordinates, a cube in Cartesian coordinates)?","['geometry', 'volume', 'surfaces', 'multivariable-calculus']"

904964,Do Anosov flows exist on two dimensional compact manifolds?,"Question: Let $M$ denote a two-dimensional, smooth, compact Riemannian manifold (without boundary). If $\phi:\mathbb{R}\times M \rightarrow M$ is a smooth flow, then prove that $\phi$ is not an Anosov flow. Motivation: I am new to the field of dynamical systems. It seems to be implicit in the literature that Anosov flows do not exist on two dimensional manifolds (see http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022039605002767 ) but I would like to know the proof. My current understanding: Assume $\phi$ is Anosov and argue for a contradiction. There is a splitting of the tangent space $T_x M = E_x^s \oplus E_x^u \oplus E_x^c$ at each $x\in M$, where $E_x^c$ is the one-dimensional subspace spanned by the direction of the flow, and the stable and unstable spaces have dimension independent of $x$. Thus, without loss of generality, suppose that $E_x^u = \{0\}$ and $\text{dim}(E_x^s)=1$. The differential of the vectors $v$ in $E_x^s$ satisfy $\|d\phi_tv\| \lesssim e^{-\gamma t} \|v\|$ for all $t\geq 0$ and some $\gamma >0$. I guess that I now need to use the fact that $M$ is compact to obtain a contradiction but I don't see how to proceed.

$$\|u_k-u\|_{L^p} \rightarrow 0 \text{ and/or } \|u_k-u\|_{W^{1,p}} \rightarrow 0?$$ I suspect that in general the answer is yes in the case of the $L^p$-norm and no in the case of the $W^{1,p}$-norm. However for $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^n$ it seems to be true in both cases: If $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^n$ and $u \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ we can choose a function 
$\eta \in C^\infty_0(B_2(0))$ with $\eta = 1$ inside $B_1(0)$ (where $B_R(0)$ is the ball with radius $R$ inside $\mathbb{R}^n$) and define for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the functions $\eta_k(x) = \eta(\frac{x}{k}) \in C^\infty_0(B_{2k}(0))$. Then set
$u_k := \eta_k u \in C^\infty_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$. By dominated convergence, we then have 
$$\|u_k-u\|_{L^p} \rightarrow 0$$
right? Similarly, it follows that 
$$\|\nabla u_k - \nabla u\|_{L^p} \rightarrow 0$$
because $(\nabla \eta_k) u \rightarrow 0$ pointwise almost everywhere. Hence also
$\|u_k-u\|_{W^{1,p}} \rightarrow 0.$ Are my thoughts correct? And what about general $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$?

905123,"What's the connection between ""hyperbolic"" inner product spaces and the hyperbolic plane?","In Jacobson's Basic Algebra I , in Kaplansky's Linear algebra and geometry and in Artin's Geometric algebra , a hyperbolic plane is defined to be a two-dimensional, nondegenerate inner product space with nonzero null vectors. (I also noticed that Lang went out of his way to define these for alternating forms only, and if I remember right, one of the three other authors did it for symmetric forms only, but I'm not sure at the moment. This may be beside the point.) When I first heard of these, I thought ""oh, there must be a model of synthetic hyperbolic geometry in there somewhere."" I thought this was a good guess because, after all, if you fix a point in the synthetic Euclidean plane and look at the transformations that fix it, it looks like the geometry of the regular dot product on $\Bbb R^2$, and the distance even matches the one extracted from the dot product. But now I'm not so sure the analogous hyperbolic picture is so direct. It's hard to see why the ""hyperbolic inner product plane"" defined above would be the same as what is going on around a fixed point in hyperbolic geometry. In fact, I have a friend trying to convince me that the two are unrelated. One of his reasons is ""in hyperbolic geometry, there aren't two distinguished null lines through points like there are in the inner product space."" Finally, it's totally unclear (to me) if there is any connection between the inner product and the distance in hyperbolic geometry. The fact that both orthogonal and symplectic geometries can have hyperbolic planes adds another layer of complexity that I don't know what to do with. I'm anticipating one of these types of answers: Of course there's a useful model of hyperbolic geometry in the hyperbolic plane. You just have to take this subset with these lines and here's how the inner product matches up to the distance like so... or Yeah, they're related, you just need to think of hyperbolic geometry and Minkowskian geometry this way... or No, they're not really directly related. You should just just think of the inner product version separately as Minkowskian geometry...

If the expansion is written this way, then $n$ can be an integer (positive or negative) or a fraction? 
If the binomial expansion is written in summation notation using nCr, then n can only be positive because nCr cannot have a negative $n$? 3) For the expansion of $(a+x)^n$ I gave in question 2, does $a$ have to be $a = 1$ with $-1 < x < 1$? 
What are these restrictions? Update : An infinite geometric series converges when the common ratio, $x$ in this case, is between -1 and 1. The infinite binomial expansion I wrote in question 2 is a valid expansion of $(a+x)^n$ when $-1 < x < 1$. So if I put $x = 0.5$ into $(a+x)^n$ for a given $n$ and $a$, $(a+0.5)^n$ and the infinite expansion for $x = 0.5$ will give the same answer. If I use $x = 40$, the expansion will diverge and not give the same answer as the original function $(a+40)^n$. Does this mean that the binomial expansion is actually a power series (a geometric series is a special case of a power series)? And does $a$ need to be 1 for the $-1 < x < 1$ to be required?

Prove that if AB = CD = EF, then the center of the circle is the incenter of $\triangle PQR$. Designate the center of the circle $G$. Thinking about it a bit, we realize if we could prove the incircle of the triangle and the circle given are concentric, we would know that the center of the circle is the incenter, for they have the same center. If we shrink the circle given down to the incircle, the incircle should intersect the triangle at the midpoints of $AB$, $CD$, and $EF$. We therefore denote the midpoint of $AB M$, the midpoint of $CD L$, andd the midpoint of $EF N$. We know the incircle is concentric to the given circle if and only if $NG$ and $LG$ are congruent, because a circle is a circle if and only if the radii are congruent.  Thus, we must prove $NG\cong LG$. When proving lengths equal, congruent triangles are always a good idea.  We see that $NGE\cong LGD$ seems likely, and it would also prove our answer if we could prove it. We know that $GD\cong GE$ because they are both radii of the larger circle, and we also know $DL\cong EN$ because they are both half of two lines that are congruent. We know $\angle GLD$ and $\angle GNE$ are both right angles, because that is where the smaller circle is tangent to the sides of the triangle.  Thus, $NGE\cong LGD$ by $HL$ congruency.

My approach: replace $x$ with $x+1$ in $(1)$ we get $$f(x+2)+f(x)=\sqrt{3}f(x+1) \tag{2}.$$ Replace $x$ with $x+2$ in $(1)$ and using $f(x+2)$ from $(2)$ we get $$f(x+3)+f(x+1)=\sqrt{3}f(x+2)=\sqrt{3}\left(\sqrt{3}f(x+1)-f(x)\right) $$ $\implies$ $$f(x+3)=2f(x+1)-\sqrt{3}f(x)=2f(x+1)-f(x+1)-f(x-1)=f(x+1)-f(x-1).$$

If we look at these points, we can create connections between them where each connection connects two points. Let $B$ be the set of all of those connections. A connection of two points is a subset of $A$ containing exactly 2 objects that belong to $A$, and so $B$ is the set of all subsets of $A$ which contain exactly 2 objects that belong to $A$. The question is: what is the cardinality of $B$? We came up with a few options, not sure whether they cover all cases, but these are the ones we thought about: $B$ is a countable set, which means its cardinality is the same as that of $A$ (This seems possible; however, we couldn't find an injective & surjective function that matches objects from $A$ to $B$) $B$'s cardinality is the cardinality of the continuum $B$'s cardinality is in between the cardinality of $A$ and the cardinality of the continuum and therefore denies the continuum hypothesis (This seems like a problematic possibility since it has been proved that the continuum hypothesis is independent of the axioms of set theory) $B$'s cardinality is smaller than that of $A$ (seems very unlikely, since $A$'s cardinality is the smallest infinite cardinal, and $B$ is clearly an infinite set).","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"

axis square; Here's the result: So something is very wrong. The edges connect the right pairs of vertices but something is still off. I think what's going on here is that I need to look at the inverse permutation of each vertex to get things right but, I'm not sure why this is necessary since I thought that by definition, the truncated octahedron is the projection from 4 dimensions into 3 dimensions of all coordinate permutations of (1,2,3,4), subsequently normalized. What's going here?","['geometry', 'permutations', 'polyhedra', 'symmetric-groups']"
906170,What is the domain of this differential equation/its solution?,"Given the differential equation $$
xy' = 2y
$$ with solution $$
y=x^2
$$ I am specifically referring to a problem in an ODE textbook. The book says that the domain/interval of solution is $$\mathbf{R} - \{0\}$$ However, I beg to disagree because the differential equation is not expressed in quotient form like: $$ y' = \frac{2y}{x} $$ And I would like to include zero in domain set. What is a consistent way of defining domains for cases like the above? EDIT : I am posting the original question below: Prove that $$y=x^2$$ is a solution of the differential equation $$ xy' = 2y $$
  Also, be sure to state the common interval for which the solution and the DE make sense. (Paraphrased from Tenenbaum and Pollard, 1963) Thanks!",['ordinary-differential-equations']
906174,insight into the definition of intersection multiplicity for two plane curves,"Let $X,Y$ be curves of $\mathbb{A}^2$ given by irreducible polynomials $f,g$ respectively, where the ground field $k$ is algebraically closed. Then it is known that the dimension of $k[x,y]/(f,g)$ as a $k$-vector space is equal to the cardinality of $X \cap Y$. Now let $P \in X \cap Y$. The intersection multiplicity of $X,Y$ at $P$ is defined as the dimension of the $k$-vector space $\mathcal{O}_P/(f,g)$, where $\mathcal{O}_P$ is the local ring at $P$. Intuitively, the effect of localization is that of removing contributions of points in $X \cap Y$ other than $P$. Question 1: How can we see that rigorously? In particular, it is mentioned here (top of page 3) http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~hochster/cmrvw.ps that ""it suffices to invert enough elements of $k[x,y]$ such that for any point in $V(f,g)-P$, at least one of the inverted elements vanishes at that point. Question 2: Why is it enough to do that? I.e. why inverting such elements removes the effect of other points in $X \cap Y$? Question 3: How can we see that $\dim_k \mathcal{O}_P/(f,g) \ge \mu_P(X) \mu_P(Y)$? This is problem I.5.4.(a) in Hartshorne and i have found none of the available online solutions satisfactory. Edit: Definition: $\mu_P(X)$ is the multiplicity of point $P$ in the variety $X$. It can be computed as follows: do a change of coordinates such that $P$ maps to $(0,0)$ and write $f=f_r+f_{r+1}+\cdots+f_n$, where $f_i$ is homogeneous of degree $i$. Then $\mu_P(X)=r$.",['algebraic-geometry']
