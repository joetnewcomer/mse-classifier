2588088,Prime ideals of a localization,"I have to answer the following question: Compute the prime ideals of the localization of $\mathbb Z$ given by the multiplicative set of the powers of $n$ (such that $n>1$) and find the nilradical of this ring. I have thought this: Let $\mathbb Z _n$ be such localization. I will use the following theorem: Let $S$ be a multiplicative set. There exists a bijection between the prime ideals $P$ of $A$ such that $P\cap S = \emptyset$ and the prime ideals of $A_S$. Let $P=(p)$ (with $p$ prime number) be a prime ideal of $\mathbb Z$, then it is bijective to a prime ideal of $\mathbb Z_n$ only if $n\notin (p)$. Is this reasoning right? How can I approach the part about the nilradical?","['localization', 'abstract-algebra', 'maximal-and-prime-ideals']"

I have tried to prove this with the homomorphism theorem by composing the embedding $\phi :m\mathbb Z\hookrightarrow \mathbb Z$ and the projection $\pi :\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Z_\frac{n}{m}$. But I'm not sure how to verify that $\ker(\pi\circ\phi)=n\mathbb Z$. Obviously $\phi$ is injective so $\ker(\pi\circ\phi)=\{mz\in m\mathbb Z\mid \phi(mz)\in \frac{n}{m}\mathbb Z\}$.

2588211,Is there a number system which eliminates singularities over rational functions?,"I tutor some high school students in Algebra 2 and Pre-Calculus. This is a questions from one of them. Here's the context: Often, when students are first introduced to the concepts of domain and range, they are told that the domain is ""all of the allowed inputs,"" where an input is allowed if it (a) is a real number and (b) produces a real number as an output. In general, they are taught that there are two situations that break these rules by accepting a real number as an input but then giving back something that is ill-defined. The two situations are zeroes in the denominators of rational functions and negative numbers under even radicals . Later, complex numbers will be introduced, and it will be explained that they solve various problems including the ill-defined-ness of the roots of negative numbers. However, the issue of dividing by zero is never resolved. Are there any number systems which resolve the issue of dividing by zero similar to how complex numbers resolve taking the square root of negative numbers? While it is not necessary, preferably this number system would be a natural extension of the real or complex numbers that avoids introducing new singularities. It seems to me that the answer to this question might depend on whether or not there are any fields where the additive identity has a multiplicative inverse.","['algebra-precalculus', 'singularity', 'field-theory', 'rational-functions']"

2588260,How strong is homotopy equivalence?,"In algebraic topology, we have the definition of homotopy equivalence of topological spaces: Topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ are homotopy equivalent if there exist continuous maps $\phi:X \rightarrow Y$ and $\psi:Y\rightarrow X$ such that $\psi \circ \phi \simeq Id_X$ and $\phi \circ \psi \simeq Id_Y$. If you compare this with the definition of homeomorphism, there are various differences. However, in terms of finding examples where two spaces are homotopy equivalent and not homeomorphic, I struggle. The only examples I can find are the cases where we involve 1-point sets. For example, a disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$ centred at the origin is not generally homeomorphic to a 1-point set, but it is homotopy equivalent to, say, the origin. The motivation for this question is that if I were asked whether two spaces were homotopy equivalent - and neither are a 1-point set, could I just check whether they were homeomorphic?","['algebraic-topology', 'general-topology']"

2588492,What is a mathematical definition of the Maxwellian spacetime?,"While this problem originated in physics, the question is purely mathematical. Because Maxwell's equations were not invariant under the Galilean transformation, Maxwell proposed his version of spacetime. It is as a 4D collection of points, such that: Between any two points $p(t, x, y, z)$ and $q(t', x', y', z')$ there is a definite temporal interval $T(p, q) = t' − t$. Between any two simultaneous points $p(t, x, y, z)$ and $q(t, x', y', z')$ there is a definite Euclidean distance $$R(p,q) = \sqrt{(x' − x)^2 + (y' − y)^2 + (z' − z)^2}$$ Any worldline $\gamma$ through the point $p$ has a definite twist $\Omega(γ, p)$. As a result of the third condition, linear acceleration is not absolute like in the Galilean spacetime. There is not enough structure in
the Maxwellian spacetime to distinguish straight worldlines from curved
worldlines. However, rotation is still absolute, because the third condition allows telling when a worldline is ""twisted"". For a worldline $\gamma$ and a point $p$ on $\gamma$, the absolute rotation of $\gamma$ w.r.t. $p$ is given by $\Omega(γ, p)$. (Image and partial content credit: Jonathan Bain, NY University .) Properties of the Maxwellian spacetime: No inertial frames (as opposed to many inertial frames in the Galilean spacetime). Velocity is relative. Acceleration is relative (as opposed to absolute in the Galilean spacetime). Rotation is absolute. Simultaneity is absolute. The mathematical definition of the Galilean spacetime is a tuple $(\mathbb{R}^4,t_{ab},h^{ab},\nabla)$ where $t_{ab}$ (temporal metric) and $h^{ab}$ (spatial metric) are tensor fields and $\nabla$ is the coordinate derivative operator specifying the geodesic trajectories ( Spacetime Structure ). A single metric does not work, because the speed of light is infinite, so time and space should be treated separately with the temporal metric: $$t_{ab}=(\text{d}_a t)(\text{d}_b t)$$ and the spatial metric: $$h^{ab}=\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^a\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^b+
\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^a\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^b+
\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)^a\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)^b$$ Finally, $\nabla$ on $\mathbb{R}^4$
is a unique flat derivative operator that for each coordinate $x^i$ satisfies: $$\nabla_a\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right)^b=\mathbf{0}$$ In turn, the Newtonian spacetime is the same tuple with an additional structure $(\mathbb{R}^4,t_{ab},h^{ab},\nabla,\lambda^a)$ where $\lambda^a$ is a field that adds the preferred frame of rest: $$\lambda^a=\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)^a$$ What is a rigorous mathematical definition of the Maxwellian spacetime? Intuitively, it may be the same Galilean tuple, but with some additional structure (or a reduced structure) similar to how the Newtonian spacetime is created by adding $\lambda$ to the Galilean tuple.

2588504,Variants of Kuratowski's 14 set theorem,"Kuratowski's 14 set theorem says that there are at most 14 sets one can obtain from a given set $A\subseteq X$ in a topological space $X$ by repeatedly applying the interior and complement operations. He also showed that if you add intersection to that list (and thus all the Boolean operations) there are potentially infinitely many sets one can obtain. My question is the following: For each $n$, what is the maximum number of sets one can obtain from a given set by using complement, intersection, and at most $n$ applications of the interior operation? It is certainly finite. For example, the number of sets one can make from the Boolean operations and one application of the interior operation is not more than the Boolean algebra freely generated by $A$ and its formal interior $int(A)$ -- i.e. 16. And, more generally, the number of sets one can make from n+1 applications of the interior operation will not exceed the size of the Boolean algebra freely generated by the elements generated by $n$ applications, and the formal interiors of those elements. As a means of answering this, it's natural to look for an analogue of disjunctive normal form in propositional logic. Each combination of Boolean operations that potentially produces different results when applied to $k$ distinct sets $A_1...A_k$ is equivalent to a combination that has the form of a union of intersections, where each intersection consists of either $A_i$ or its complement for each $i \in 1...k$. So my second question is: Is there a (pretty) canonical way of expressing the combinations of operations from $\{int, \cdot^c, \cap, \cup\}$, in $k$ variables, that potentially produce different sets? More precisely, we may define the formal expressions over variables $A_1...A_k$ as follows: $A_1...A_k$ are expressions, and $int(B)$, $B^c$, $B\cap C$ and $B\cup C$ are expressions if $B$ and $C$ are (and, moreover, the expressions are the smallest set of strings closed under these rules). Say that two expressions are equivalent if they evaluate to the same thing in every topological space, for every assignment of sets to the variables. A satisfactory answer to 2 must then deliver a collection of canonical expressions such that no two canonical expressions are equivalent, and such that every expression is equivalent to a canonical expression. Of course, to answer question 1 we only need the case where k=1. (Any pointers to relevant literature also appreciated.) EDIT: Incidentally, I'm particularly interested in the case where $X$ is extremally disconnected, so if imposing that condition makes the question simpler I'd also be very interested.","['general-topology', 'logic', 'modal-logic']"

2588553,Find the value of $a^4+b^4+c^4$,"The problem: The sum of three numbers is $6$, the sum of their squares is $8$, and the sum of their cubes is $5$.  What is the sum of their fourth powers? Based on the above information, we have:
\begin{align}
a + b + c &= 6 \\
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 & = 8 \\
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 & = 5 \\
\end{align} I had a feeling that this vaguely had to do with Viete's theorem, which states for a cubic polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - px^2 + qx - r$ which has roots $\alpha , \beta , \gamma$, \begin{align}
p & = \alpha+\beta+\gamma \\
q & = \alpha \beta+\alpha\gamma+\beta\gamma \\
r & = \alpha\beta\gamma
\end{align} Notice that we already have $p$, because $a+b+c=6=\alpha + \beta + \gamma = p$. Then to find $q$: \begin{align}
2q& = 2\alpha\beta+2\alpha\gamma+2\beta\gamma \\
& = [(a+b+c)^2-(a^2+b^2+c^2)] \\
& = (a^2+ab+ac+b^2+ab+bc+c^2+ac+bc)-a^2-b^2-c^2 \\
& = 2ab+2ac+2bc
\end{align} \begin{align}
q & = ab+ab+bc \\
& = \frac{1}{2}[(a+b+c)^2-(a^2+b^2+c^2)] \\
& = \frac{1}{2}[6^2-8] \\
& = 14
\end{align} So now we have $f(x) = x^3-6x^2+14x-r$. And it follows that $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)=f(\gamma)=0$. \begin{align}
f(\alpha) & = \alpha^3-6\alpha^2+14\alpha-r = 0\\
f(\beta) & = \beta^3-6\beta^2+14\beta-r = 0\\
f(\gamma) & = \gamma^3-6\gamma^2+14\gamma-r = 0\\
\end{align} \begin{align}
0 & = f(\alpha) + f(\beta) + f(\gamma) \\
& = (\alpha^3+\beta^3+\gamma^3)-6(\alpha^2+\beta^2+\gamma^2)+14(\alpha+\beta+\gamma)-3r\\
& = 5-6(8)+14(6)-3r\\
3r& = 41\\
r & = \frac{41}{3} \\
\end{align} Now we have that $f(x)=x^3-6x^2+14x-\frac{41}{3}$. Here's where I am stuck. Of course, the above working out was the culmination of hours of trying things out, and eventually we have this equation. If you are reading this now, I'd appreciate if you gave any hints as to how I should continue the problem.

2588903,Opens maps from topological manifolds whose fibers are not generically topological foliations,"Update. I have asked this on MO , but have not yet received an answer. Proposition. The quotient map associated to a topological foliation (projecting to the leaf space) is open. However the fibers of an open map from a topological manifold need not foliate its domain. Example. Consider the multiplication map $\mathbb R^2\to \mathbb R,(x,y)\mapsto xy$. It is open, but I think its fibers do not give a topological foliation of the plane because the fiber over zero is the union of the axes, which does not look like parallel lines locally about the origin. In the above example, the problem is at an isolated point. That leads me to wonder how far the fibers of an open map can be from ""generically"" foliations. Definition. Let $X$ be a topological manifold. A partition of $X$ is generically a foliation of $X$ if it restricts to a foliation of an open dense subspace (which is also a topological manifold). Example. I think the fibers of the multiplication maps give a generic foliation of the plane as they foliate the punctured plane. I'm fairly certain a map (set function even) $f:X\to Y$ of topological spaces is open iff for every convergent net $y_\alpha\to y$ we have $f^{-1}(y)\subset\lim \left\{ f^{-1}(y_\alpha ) \right\}$, so the fibers of an open map are ""stuck together"" in this sense. I would like to understand exactly how different the latter sense is from the fibers actually being generically foliating. Question. What are some examples of a (continuous) open map from a topological manifold $X$ whose fibers are not generically a foliation of $X$? What are some examples if we moreover assume the map is a quotient map? Remark. I am looking for maximally ""geometric"" (i.e minimally ""fractal"") examples.","['manifolds', 'general-topology', 'foliations', 'open-map']"

Munkres, 2nd edition: Theorem. Let $J$ and $C$ be well-ordered sets; assume that there is no surjective function mapping a section of $J$ onto $C$. Then there exists a unique function $h \colon J \to C$ satisfying the equation 
  $$ h(x) = \mathrm{smallest} \left[ C - h \left( S_x \right) \right] \tag{*} $$ 
  for each $x \in J$, where $S_x$ is the section of $J$ by $x$. Proof . (a) If $h$ and $k$ map sections of $J$, or all of $J$, into $C$ and satisfy (*) for all $x$ in their respective domains, show that $h(x) = k(x)$ for all $x$ in both domains. (b) If there exists a function $h \colon S_\alpha \to C$ satisfying (*), show that there exists a function $k \colon S_\alpha \cup \{ \alpha \} \to C$ satisfying (*). (c) If $K \subset J$ and for all $\alpha \in K$ there exists a function $h_\alpha \colon S_\alpha \to C$ satisfying (*), show that there exists a function $$ k \colon \bigcup_{ \alpha \in K} S_\alpha \to C $$
  satisfying (*). (d) Show by transfinite induction that for every $\beta \in J$, there exists a function $h_\beta \colon S_\beta \to C$ satisfying (*). [ Hint : If $\beta$ has an immediate predecessor $\alpha$, then $S_\beta = S_\alpha \cup \{ \alpha \}$. If not, $S_\beta$ is the union of all $S_\alpha$ with $\alpha < \beta$. ] (e) Prove the theorem. My Attempt: Part (a): Suppose that there exists an element $x \in \mathrm{Dom} (h) \cap \mathrm{Dom} (k) $ such that $h(x) \neq k(x)$. Then the set of all such $x$ is a non-empty subset of $J$ and hence has a smallest element $\alpha$, say. Since each of the functions $h$ and $k$ is defined either on all of $J$ or on some section of $J$ and since $\alpha$ is in both domains, therefore we can conclude that both $h$ and $k$ are defined on the section  $S_\alpha$ of $J$ by $\alpha$. [Am I right?] And since $\alpha$ is the smallest element common to the domains of $h$ and $k$ at which these two functions differ, we can also conclude that $h(x) = k(x)$ for all $x \in S_\alpha$, and therefore 
  $$ h \left( S_\alpha \right) = k \left( S_\alpha \right). \tag{1} $$
  Now as both $h$ and $k$ satisfy (*), so we can conclude from (1) that 
  $$ h( \alpha ) = \mathrm{smallest} \left[ C - h \left( S_\alpha \right) \right] = \mathrm{smallest} \left[ C - k \left( S_\alpha \right) \right] = k( \alpha), $$
  which contradicts our choice of $\alpha$. Hence the functions $h$ and $k$ coincide on the common part of their domains, as required. Is this proof correct and clear enough? If not, then where are the problems in it? Part (b): Suppose that, for some $\alpha \in J$, there exists a function $h \colon S_\alpha \to C$ satisfying (*). Then, according to the hypothesis of this theorem, this function $h$ cannot be surjective. So the set $h \left( S_\alpha \right)$ is a proper subset of $C$, and therefore the set $C - h \left( S_\alpha \right)$, being a non-empty subset of the well-ordered set $C$, must have a smallest element. Now let the function $k \colon S_\alpha \cup \{ \alpha \} \to C$ be defined as follows: $$ k(x) = \begin{cases} h(x) \ & \mbox{ if } x \in S_\alpha, \\ \mathrm{smallest} \left[ C - h \left( S_\alpha \right) \right] \ & \mbox{ if } x = \alpha. \end{cases} $$ 
  Then $k$ also satisfies (*). [Am I right?] Is this proof correct and clear enough too? If not, then where are the issues? Part (c): Suppsoe $K \subset J$ and suppose that for each $\alpha \in K$ there exists a function $h_\alpha \colon S_\alpha \to C$ satisfying (*). We assume that our set $K$ is non-empty. Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $\bigcup_{\alpha \in K} S_\alpha$. Then there exists at least one $\alpha \in K$ such that $x \in S_\alpha$. Suppoes that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are any two distinct elements of $K$ such that $x \in S_\alpha \cap S_\beta$. As $\alpha, \beta \in J$ and as $J$ is a simply ordered set, so either $\alpha < \beta$ or $\beta < \alpha$. We assume without loss of generality that $\alpha < \beta$. Then $S_\alpha \cap S_\beta = S_\alpha$. So by Part (a) we can conclude that 
  $$ h_\beta (x) = h_\alpha(x). \tag{2} $$
  Now let $K_x$ be the subset of $K$ consisting of all the elements $\alpha \in K$ such that $x \in S_\alpha$; that is, let 
  $$ K_x \colon= \left\{ \ \alpha \in K \ \colon \ x \in S_\alpha \ \right\}. \tag{3} $$ 
  Then $K_x$, being a non-empty subset of $K$ and hence of $J$, has a smallest element $\alpha_x$, say. Hence using the same reasoning as the one used in arriving at (2) we can conclude that 
  $$ h_\alpha(x) = h_{\alpha_x}(x) \ \mbox{ for all } \alpha \in K_x. \tag{4} $$ Now let $k \colon \bigcup_{ \alpha \in K} S_\alpha \to C$ be the function defined by the formula 
  $$ k(x) = h_{\alpha_x}(x) \ \mbox{ for all } x \in \bigcup_{\alpha \in K} S_\alpha, \tag{5} $$
  where $\alpha_x$ is the smallest element of the set $K_x$ in (3) above. Now we show that this function $k$ also satisfies (*). For any point $x \in \bigcup_{\alpha \in K} S_\alpha$, we note that, if $\alpha_x$ is the smallest element in $K$ such that $x \in S_{\alpha_x}$, then 
  $k(x) = h_{\alpha_x}(x)$. Let us fix an element $x \in \bigcup_{\alpha \in K} S_\alpha$. Now let us take any element  $v \in S_{x}$. Then $v \in J$ and $v < x <  \alpha_x$, and we also have $\alpha_v \leq \alpha_x$, where $\alpha_v$ is the smallest element of the set $K_v$ as defined in (3) above, which in turn implies that $S_{\alpha_v} \subset S_{\alpha_x}$ and so  using (a) we can also conclude that 
  $$   h_{\alpha_x}(v) = h_{\alpha_v}(v) = k(v).   $$
  That is, 
  $$ k(v) = h_{\alpha_x}(v) \ \mbox{ for all } v \in S_{x}.  $$
  Therefore we can conclude that
  $$ k \left( S_{x} \right) = h_{\alpha_x} \left( S_{x} \right),  \tag{6} $$
  and hence 
  $$ k(x) = h_{\alpha_x}(x) = \mathrm{smallest} \left[ C - h_{\alpha_x} \left( S_x \right) \right] = \mathrm{smallest} \left[ C - k \left( S_x \right) \right]. $$
  Thus our function $k$ also satisfies (*). Is this proof correct? If so, then is it clear enough too? If not, then where are the problems in it in either logic or clarity?","['well-orders', 'proof-verification', 'logic', 'order-theory', 'elementary-set-theory']"

And many other products I've tried don't equal the identity. I suspect this is faithful, but I don't know how to approach a proof. I should add how I found this representation, as it looks like magic. I was thinking about how you can place $3$ triangles around a vertex to get a regular tetrahedron, $4$ for an octohedron, $5$ for icosahedron. And these live nicely in Euclidean space. With $8$ triangles around each vertex you get a tiling of a hyperbolic surface which doesn't live nicely in Euclidean space. So let's put it there anyway. At each vertex, instead of wrapping 8 triangles once around a vertex, if you wrapped them twice around each vertex, you would cover an octohedron. If instead you wrap them $3$ times around each vertex, you can still put the whole tiling in Euclidean $3$ space, but maybe without any triangles coinciding. It intersects itself all over the place, and is infinite, so a picture doesn't help. But, you can find matrices which represent rotation around a specific edge ( $a$ ) or triangle ( $b$ ). To make things easier I required $ab$ to correspond to a rotation of $3/8$ of a turn around the z axis. Then I cleaned up the representation a bit.

So I think $u, U: \mathbb{R}^d\to \Bbb{R}^d$ or $u,U:\Bbb{R}^{d+1}\to\Bbb{R}^d$. $p$ is the pressure, so I would say it is a scalar function that depends on the spatial coordinates as well, but not on time, so $p: \Bbb{R}^d \to \Bbb{R}$. I believe my struggle has to do with the fact that I don't know what are the meanings of the operators in the context they are being used. If $u,U$ and $p$ have the dimensions I think they have, then  $\nabla \cdot u$ is the only thing that I understand. What does the gradient, $\nabla u$, mean? When $u$ is scalar, $\nabla u$ is a vector. What if $u$ is a vector already? Is $\nabla u$ a matrix? While trying to understand what is going on I read about dyadics in Wikipedia. It felt like it could make sense here, but then what is the meaning of $U\cdot \nabla u$, if $U$ is a vector and $\nabla u$ is a matrix? And of course, $\nabla^2$ which I know is the Laplace operator, with which I am also familiar when applied to a scalar function. If $u$ is a vector, then what is $\nabla^2 u$? Is it a vector as well?

 \frac{x}{(1+(n-1)x)(1+nx)}$$ on the intervals $[a,b]$ where $(0 < a < b)$ and $[0,b]$ where $(b>0)$ My attempt: (i) On the interval $[a,b]$ Approach (1) Notice that $$\frac{x}{(1+(n-1)x)(1+nx)} = \frac{1}{1+(n-1)x} - \frac{1}{1+nx}$$ Hence: $$\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{x}{(1+(n-1)x)(1+nx)} = 1 - \frac{1}{1+nx}$$ so the series converges pointwise to the constant $1$-function. The convergence is uniform: $$\sup_{x \in [a,b]}\left|1-\frac{1}{1+nx}-1\right| \leq \frac{1}{na} \to 0$$ Approach (2) $$\sup_{x \in [a,b]} \left|\frac{x}{(1+(n-1)x)(1+nx)}\right| \leq \frac{b}{(1+(n-1)a)(1+na)} = \frac{b}{n²}\frac{1}{(1/n + a((n-1)/n))(1/n +a)}$$ and the last expression is a converging sequence (to $a^{-2}$), so it is bounded above by a real number $M$ and hence:$$\sup_{x \in [a,b]} \left|\frac{x}{(1+(n-1)x)(1+nx)}\right| \leq \frac{b}{(1+(n-1)a)(1+na)} \leq \frac{Mb}{n^2}$$ and we can deduce uniform convergence by the Weierstrass' M-test. (ii) On the interval $[0,b]$ Approach (1) Again, using the partial sums, we can see that the series of functions converges pointwise to $f(x) = \begin{cases}1 \quad x \neq 0 \\0 \quad x =0\end{cases}$. This is a function that is not continuous, but the partial sums are. Hence, the convergence can't be uniform. Approach (2) We can also show this directly. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Let $m \geq n$ such that $\frac{1}{m}< b$. Let $x = \frac{1}{m}$. Then: $$\left|1-\frac{1}{1+mx}-1\right| = 1/2$$ Hence, the series does not converge uniformly. Approach (3) Now, I would like to use Cauchy's convergence criterium, as I consider using partial sums a bit cheating, in the sense that it is often impossible to find them. However, I'm struggling with this one. Can someone give a proof that the series does not converge uniformly with the cauchy criterium?

We construct the proof by recourse to Mathematical-Induction on $|A| = n$. For $|A| = 0$ it is evident that $A = I_0 = \varnothing$ consequently the $|F| = 1 = 0!$ Now Assume for an arbitrary natural number $k$ that given any set $X$ such that $|X| = k$ the set $Y = \{f|f:I_n \xrightarrow{\rm bijection}X\}$ is such that $|Y| = k!$ Let $A$ be an arbitrary set and assume that $|A| = k+1$, furthermore let $F = \{f|f:I_n \xrightarrow{\rm bijection} A\}$ and $h:I_{k+1}\xrightarrow{\rm bijection}A$. Now consider the following definition.
$$\forall i\in I_{k+1}\left(A_{i} = \{g|g:I_k\xrightarrow{\rm bijection}A\backslash\{h(i)\}\}\right)$$ We now prove a series of Lemmas that will help with our subsequent argument. Lemma.(1) . $\forall i\in I_{k+1}\forall j\in I_{k+1}(i\neq j\implies A_i\cap A_j = \varnothing)$ Proof. Assume on the contrary that for some $i,j\in I_{k+1}$ that $i\neq j$ but $A_i\cap A_j \neq\varnothing$ consequently there exists a $s:I_k \xrightarrow{\rm bijection} A$ such that $s\in A_i\cap A_j$ since $s$ is surjective it follows that for some $q\in I_k$, $f(q)= h(j)$ equivalently $(f(q),h(j))\in s$ but the definition of $A_j$ implies that no such ordered pair exists in $A_j$. $\square$ Lemma.(2) . $ \cup_{i\in I_{k+1}}A_i \thicksim F$ Proof. Consider now the function $\mathcal{N}:\cup_{i\in I_{k+1}}A_i\to F$ defined as follows
$$\mathcal{N}(f) = f\cup\left\{(k+1,h(j))\right\}\ \operatorname{where}\ f\in A_j$$
With the above definition it  is not difficult to see that $\mathcal{N}$ is a is a bijection we leave the details to the reader. $\square$ Using Lemma(1) in conjunction with (7) implies that $\cup_{i\in I_{k+1}A_i}$ is finite and 
$$|\cup_{i\in I_{k+1}}A_i| = \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}|A_i|$$
and by using (7) in conjunction with Lemma(2) we can deduce the following 
$$|F| = |\cup_{i\in I_{k+1}}A_i|$$
from the inductive hypothesis we know that $\forall i\in I_{k+1}(|A_i| = k!)$ consequently

2590243,Examples of non-measurable sets(Lebesgue),"I made this post because i would like to see some examples of non-measurable sets with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\Bbb{R}^d$ A first example is the classical Vitaly set. Another example which involves dynamical systems is this: Let $([0,1),\mathcal{B},m,T)$ where $Tx=(x+a)mod1=\{x+a\}=x+a-[x+a]$ where $a \in \Bbb{R}\setminus \Bbb{Q}$ $T$ is an irrational rotation. Every orbit $\{T^nx|n \in \Bbb{Z}\}$ is infinite for all $x \in [0,1)$ We use the axiom of choice and we construct the set $A \subseteq [0,1)$ which contains exactly $\text{one}$ element of every orbit of $T$ In other words $\forall x \in [0,1)$ exists unique $m \in \Bbb{Z}$ such that $T^mx \in A$ It is clear that $A$ is uncountable. Not let $B_i=T^i(A)$ . It is not difficult to see that $B_i \cap B_j=\emptyset,\forall i \neq j$ in $\Bbb{Z}$ Now if $A$ is Lebesgue measurable then: $m(\bigcup_{i \in \Bbb{Z}}B_i)=\sum_{i \in \Bbb{Z}}m(B_i)=\sum_{i \in \Bbb{Z}}m(A)$ because the Lebesgue measure is translation-invariant(or $T-$ invariant). Also $1=m(\bigcup_{i \in \Bbb{Z}}B_i)$ because $\bigcup_{i \in \Bbb{Z}}B_i=[0,1)$ Thus if we assume that $m(A)>0$ or $m(A)=0$ we easily derive a contradiction. Thus $A$ is not Lebesgue measurable.
