I am used to doing these problems with $t=0$ as the boundary layer. Using these methods, I get the outer approximation to be $y_0=0$, which I know is correct, but I'm at a loss on how to proceed with the inner approximation.

1556008,How can I differentiate the following using Matrix Calculus?,"The mathematical expression is like this: $f(\mu_{q(\beta)}, \Sigma_{q(\beta)}) = \mathbf{1}_{n}^{T} \exp \left \{ X \mu_{q(\beta)} + \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{diagonal}(X \Sigma_{q(\beta)} X^{T}) \right\}$ where $\exp$ indicates element-wise exponentiation and $\operatorname{diagonal}$ is a vector with the diagonal entries of the matrix as its components. Additionally, $\mathbf{1}_{n}^{T}$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with only ones as its entries and for notational ease, I used lower-case for vectors whereas matrices are in upper-case. $\Sigma_{q(\beta)}$ is symmetric whereas $X$ is not.

1556018,Simple proof that a Lebesgue-measurable and additive function is linear,"Let $(\Bbb R, \mathcal A_{\Bbb R}^*,\overline{\lambda})$ be the complete lebesgue-measure space. Let $f:\Bbb R\to \Bbb R$ be an additive function and also Lebesgue-measurable: $$\text{I want to prove that:}\;\;f(x)=f(1)\ x\;\;\forall x\in\Bbb R$$ Proof: So first I prove some clearly results. Lemma 1 : $\;f(x-y)=f(x)-f(y)\;\forall x,y\in\Bbb R$ Let $x,y\in\Bbb R$ so, since $f$ is additive, we get that:
$$f(0)=f(0+0)=f(0)+f(0)\Rightarrow\ f(0)=0\\
\Rightarrow\ 0=f(0)=f(x+(-x))=f(x)+f(-x)\Leftrightarrow\ -f(x)=f(-x)$$ thereby $\;f(x-y)=f(x)+f(-y)=f(x)-f(y).$ Lemma 2 : $\;r\ f(x)=f(rx)\;\;\forall r\in\Bbb Q\;\forall x\in\Bbb R$ Let $x\in\Bbb R$ we state that $\;n\ f(x)=f(nx)\;\forall n\in\Bbb N$. Because (by induction over n) for $n=2$ is clear that $f(2x)=f(x+x)=f(x)+f(x)=2f(x)$, if we suppose that $f(nx)=nf(x)$ follows for $n$ we get that $f((n+1)x)=f(nx+x)=f(nx)+f(x)=nf(x)+f(x)=(n+1)f(x)$. Then let $\;m=-n\;\;\forall n\in\Bbb N$ thus $\;f(mx)=f(-nx)=-nf(x)=mf(x)$ and hence $f(zn)=zf(x)\;\;\forall z\in\Bbb Z\Rightarrow\ r=\frac{n}{m}$ with $m,n\in\Bbb Z$, $(n,m)=1$ and $m\ne 0$ By last, let $r\in\Bbb Q\setminus\Bbb Z$. So, since $f(mx)=mf(x),$ by taking $x=\frac{y}{m}$ and $q=\frac{1}{m}$ we get that $f(y)=\frac{1}{q}f\big(\frac{y}{m}\big)\Leftrightarrow\ qf(y)=f\big(\frac{y}{m}\big)\Leftrightarrow\ \frac{1}{m}f(y)=f\big(\frac{y}{m}\big)$ and thus $f(rx)=f\big(\frac{n}{m} x\big)=nf\big(\frac{1}{m}x\big)=\frac{n}{m}f(x)=rf(x)$. Now I want to prove that $f$ is continuous: So, it's clear that: 
$$\bigcup_{m>0}\{x\in\Bbb R:|f(x)|\le m\}=\Bbb R\ne\emptyset$$
Let $A_m=\{x\in\Bbb R:|f(x)|\le m\}$, then for each fixed $t\in\Bbb R\;\exists\ m_t>0\;$ s.t. $\;t\in A_{m_t}\;$ so $\;\overline{\lambda}(A_{m_t})>0$.(where $A_m\in\mathcal A_{\Bbb R}^*$ follows since $f^{-1}([-m,m])=A_m$ and $f$ is measurable) So, by Steinhaus Theorem , there $\exists\ \delta>0\;$ s.t. if $\;|x|<\delta$ we get that: $$\overline{\lambda}\big(A_{m_t}\cap (A_{m_t}+x)\big)>0\\
\text{and that}\;\; (-\delta,\delta)\subset \{a-a':a,a'\in A_{m_t}\}=:\ A_{m_t}-A_{m_t}$$ Thereby $\forall x\in (-\delta,\delta)\;\;\exists\ a,a'\in A_{m_t}\;$ s.t. $\; x=a-a'\Rightarrow\ f(x)=f(a-a')=f(a)-f(a')\Rightarrow\ |f(x)|=|f(a)-f(a')|\le m_t+m_t=2m_t$. Namely $\forall x\in (-\delta,\delta)\Rightarrow\ |f(x)|\le 2m_t$ so taking $\delta^*=\frac{\delta}{2^{n+1}}$ for $\; n\in\Bbb N\;\;$ we get that: $$\text{if}\;\; |x-y|<\delta^*\Rightarrow\  2^{n+1}|x-y|<\delta\Rightarrow\ |2^{n+1}(x-y)|<\delta\\
\Rightarrow\Big|f\big(2^{n+1}(x-y)\big)\Big|\le 2m_t$$ thus (by lemma 1 and 2) $$|f(x)-f(y)|=|f(x-y)|=\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\Big|f\big(2^{n+1}(x-y)\big)\Big|\le \frac{2m_t}{2^{n+1}}=\frac{m_t}{2^n}\\
\Rightarrow\ |f(x)-f(y)|\le \frac{m_t}{2^n}\to 0,\;\;\ n\to\infty $$ therefore $f$ is continuous. So at last, let $\epsilon>0$: If $f(1)=0$, $f(x)=xf(1)$ follows straightforward. If $f(1)\ne 0$, we take $\delta_{\epsilon}=\frac{\epsilon}{2|f(1)|}$ so if $|x|<\delta_{\epsilon}$ then
$$|f(x)-xf(1)|\le |f(x)|+|x||f(1)|$$ where $|f(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ by the particular continuity of $f$ at $0$, so $$|f(x)-xf(1)|\le |f(x)|+|x||f(1)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}+\delta_{\epsilon}|f(1)|=\frac{\epsilon}{2}+\frac{\epsilon}{2}=\epsilon$$ hence $f(x)=xf(1)\;\;\forall x\in\Bbb R.$","['lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory']"

1556364,"Minimising Function, derivative with exponentials","First of all, I apologise for not giving a more descriptive title. I really do not know how to word it. I'll go straight into the meat of the question.

$$h'(x)=\frac{xe^x-5e^x+5}{x^6}$$

1556438,Lie groups for beginners: Lie group of hyperbolic geometry,"I am trying to understand Lie groups and their relation to (2 dimensional) hyperbolic geometry. as far as I understand it  (which is not very far, I am pushing my understanding here) the  Lie-group is the set of all isometric transformations  in a geometry. So in hyperbolic geometry this is the set of all reflections , translations, rotations, horolation and maybe other (hyperbolic) length preserving transformations. But then What does it mean that ""the transformation group of hyperbolic geometry is the Orthochronous Lorentz group $O ( 1 , n ) / O ( 1 ) $ ?"" (found for example at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_geometry#Examples ) As far as I can follow it  (and I am pushing my understanding here) it should depend on which mode of hyperbolic geometry you use.

(the first one being reflections in hyperbolic lines, the second one multiple reflections.

1556560,What does the case of $\operatorname{Spec}C^{\infty}(M)$ tell us about the relavance of scheme theory to general rings?,"I guess a lot of people with previous exposure to differential geometry have had this naive question pop out in their mind when studying schemes for the first time. The category of compact smooth real manifolds is contra-equivalent to the category of smooth rings on them $C^{\infty} (-)$. The inverse functor to the global section functor takes maximal ideals and makes sheafs out of the smooth rings. By a partion of unity argument the ring of global sections determines the sheaf so wer'e good. (At least, I hope we are. It's not something I found written explicitly in any book). On the other hand, the famous result for schemes gives the equivalence $\mathsf {Aff} \cong (\mathsf{Ring})^{op}$. This suggests that the correct and uniform way to think about rings geometrically is studying the functor $Spec$. There are many reasons for why studying $\operatorname{Spec}C^{\infty}(M)$ Is not so fruitfull. Elaboration on this in answers would be welcome as well, though my question is a more philosophical one. Question: Given what we know about the unsuitability of scheme theory for the study of smooth rings why should we believe that it's the right generalization for algebraic geometry over arbitrary rings?

$$\cap \varnothing = \cup(\mathbf{B})$$

$$\cap \varnothing = \cup(\mathbf{B}) \neq \Omega = \cap \varnothing$$

1556749,Classical and intuitionistic propositional logic in the propositions-as-sets interpretation,"I'm looking for a way to describe classical and intuitionistic propositional logic such that the transition between the two seems natural and intuitive.  I came up with the following but I'm unsure if it's actual true. Just like the propositions-as-types interpretation for intuitionistic logic, one can give a propositions-as-sets interpretation for classical logic.  If the logical language consists of $\land,\lor,\Rightarrow,\bot$, we can interpret these symbols as the set operations $\times,\oplus,\rightarrow,\emptyset$ and a propositional formula $\phi[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ is valid iff we can prove (in set theory enriched by $\times,\oplus,\rightarrow,\emptyset$) that $\exists Y.Y\in\tilde\phi[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ for the corresponding set theoretical term $\tilde\phi$.  (Since the $X_i$ appear free in $\tilde\phi$, we can also prove $\forall X_1,\dots,X_n.\exists Y.Y\in\tilde\phi[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ then.) I'm pretty sure that this part is correct, since basically not much is done, one only asks about emptyness of sets and we know that $X\times Y$ is empty iff $X$ or $Y$ is, $X\oplus Y$ is empty iff $X$ and $Y$ is, $X\rightarrow Y$ is empty iff $X$ but not $Y$ is such as $\emptyset$ is empty. Now I feel like one could say that the propositions which are intuitionistically true are exactly those where we find canonical inhabitants of the respective set.  For example, we can show $\exists Y.Y\in X\oplus(X\rightarrow\emptyset)$ but there is no canonical choice for such $Y$.  I thought maybe one could make precise what is meant by 'canonical inhabitant of $\phi$' by saying there exists a (set theoretical) formula $\chi[X_1,\dots,X_n,Y]$ such that we can prove: $$(\exists! Y.\chi[X_1,\dots,X_n,Y])\land(\forall Y.\chi[X_1,\dots,X_n,Y]\Rightarrow Y\in\tilde\phi[X_1,\dots,X_n])$$ (Since the $X_i$ appear free in the formula, as before the $Y$ can depend on them.) Is there some theory along these lines, if it makes any sense at all? EDIT: This conjecture is not true, take $\phi[X]:=\bot\Rightarrow X$.  Then clearly $\tilde\phi[X]=\emptyset\rightarrow X$ equals $\{\emptyset\}$ (no matter what $X$ is because $\emptyset$ is an initial object in the category of sets) so it contains a very canonical inhabitant (i.e. this inhabitant doesn't even depend on $X$). But maybe it remains true if we do not translate $\bot$ to $\emptyset$ but just some unspecified fresh variable $X_\bot$ and place the condition $X_\bot\subseteq X_i$ over everything?","['intuitionistic-logic', 'reference-request', 'propositional-calculus', 'logic', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Then how to show that $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality? Munkres' Hint: We define $A_1 \colon= A$, $B_1 \colon= B$, and, for $n > 1$, we define $A_n \colon= f(A_{n-1})$ and $B_n \colon= f(B_{n-1})$. Thus, we have 
$$B_1 = B \subset A_1 = A$$
and 
$$A_2 = f(A_1) = f(A) \subset B = B_1,$$
that is, 
$$A_2 \subset B_1 \subset A_1.$$
Now if, for any +ive integer $n \geq 1$, we have 
$$B_{n+1} \subset B_n \subset A_n, $$
then we also have
$$B_{n+2} = f(B_{n+1}) \subset f(B_n) = B_{n+1}$$
and 
$$B_{n+1} = f(B_n) \subset f(A_n) = A_{n+1},  $$
that is, 
$$B_{n+2} \subset B_{n+1} \subset A_{n+1}.$$
Hence using induction we can conclude that
$$A_{n+1} \subset B_n \subset A_n \ \mbox{ for each } \ n \in \mathbb{N}.$$
That is, 
$$A_1 \supset B_1 \supset A_2 \supset B_2 \supset A_3 \supset B_3 \supset \ldots.$$ Now let the map $h \colon A \to B$ be defined as follows:
$$ h(x) \colon= 
\begin{cases} 
f(x) \ & \mbox{ if } \ x \in A_n - B_n \ \mbox{ for some } \ n; \\
x \ & \mbox{ otherwise}. 
\end{cases}
$$
Munkres claims that this map $h$ is a bijection. How do we show this? Injectivity of $h$: Suppose $a, x \in A$ such that $h(a) = h(x)$. We need to show that $a=x$. If there exist $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a \in A_m - B_m$ and $x \in A_n - B_n$, then we must have 
$$f(a) = h(a) = h(b) = f(b),$$
which implies $a = b$. On the other hand, if $a \not\in A_n - B_n$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $x \not\in A_n - B_n$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then we have 
$$a = h(a) = h(b) = b.$$ How to show that $a = b$ in the following situation? There exists some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a \in A_m - B_m$ but 
$x \not\in A_n - B_n$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Surjectivity of $h$: Let $b \in B$. Then $b \in A$. If $b \not\in A_n - B_n$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then we have 
$b = h(b)$. On the other hand, if, for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $b \in A_k - B_k$, then let $k$ be the smallest such positive integer. If $k = 1$, then we have $b \in A - B$, which is a contradiction as $b \in B$, by our hypothesis. So we must have $k > 1$; rather, $k \geq 2$.

Then there are vectors $v_1,v_2 \in V$ such that $(\star) \hspace{1mm} v = T^2(v_1)=T(v_2)$ and $T(v)=0$ Thus $T(v) = T^3(v_1) = T^2(v_2) = 0$, implying that $$T(v) = T^3(v_1)+T^2(v_2)= T(T^2(v_1)+T(v_2)) \Longleftrightarrow v = T^2(v_1)+T(v_2)= v + v = 2v$$ $$\hspace{5.6cm} \Longleftrightarrow v = 2v \Rightarrow v = 0.$$ Conversely, assume that the intersection of $\text{range}(T)$ and $\ker(T)$ is trivial and let $v \in \text{range}(T^2)$. Then there exists $u \in V$ such that $v = T^2(u)=T(T(u))$. Since $T$ is an operator, $T(u) \in V$, implying that there exists a vector $w \in V$ such that $w = T(u)$. Hence $T^2(u)=T(w) = v$, implying that $v \in \text{range}(T)$, and so $\text{range}(T^2) \subset \text{range} (T)$. This is where I get stuck. I'm trying to show that $\dim \text{range} (T^2) = \dim \text{range}(T)$, so the above inclusion implies equality, but I am having trouble.

Find the number of ways in which you can select $n^2$ cells from this grid such that there is exactly one cell coming from each subgrid, one from each row and one from each column. My try: Since we have $n^2$ rows, $n^2$ columns and $n^2$ subgrids in total, we have to choose one and only one cell from each of them. Let's choose them one at a time. We can choose the first cell in $n^4$ many ways. Then, we'll have to avoid that subgrid, that column and that row that we've chosen the first one from when choosing the second cell. So, we have $n^4-n^2-2n(n-1)$ choices. We can continue this to get the total number of possible ways. But, I think there's a hole. Say, we've chosen the first cell from the subgrid of the up-left corner and the second from the subgrid just right to it so that it doesn't violate any rules.

1557838,A map from zeros of $\zeta(s)$ to zeros of $C(s)?$,"Let $P(s),C(s),\zeta(s)$ be the prime zeta function, the analogous composite zeta function, and the classical zeta function. I do not know whether it is known that there are infinitely many zeros of C, (or P). As an exercise I tried to show this. My question is whether A-C below is a plausible argument (in the sense that it could be made into a proof) for the proposition: Proposition: There are infinitely many zeros of $C(s)$ (and $ P(s)$). A. Loosely speaking, a zero of an analytic function $f$ is a continuous function of $f.$ Since $\zeta,P,C$ are analytic, it seems that Paul Rosenbloom's 1969 paper in J. of Approximation Thy, ""Perturbation of the Zeros of Analytic Functions I"", applies, in particular Hurwitz's thm. If $f_n\to f$ the limit pts. of the zeros of $f_n$ are the zeros of f. More to the point, he appears to show that (with conditions) if f is close to g, near any point where g is close to 0 there is a point where g is exactly zero. B. We can map every nontrivial zero of $\zeta(s)$ to a zero or set of zeros of $C(s)$ and conversely. Starting at a nontrivial zero of $\zeta(s)$ we subtract (if necessary, small multiples of) terms of the analytic continuation of $P(s)$ from $\zeta(s),$ which shifts the zero of $\zeta$ stepwise towards that of $C(s).$ In a small finite number of steps the zero of the perturbed function approximates that of $C(s).$ C. Two zeros may map to the same zero of C (or P) but this is not I think an issue. If we can show that for given zero $z$ of $\zeta$ and the (finite) set of zeros $s$ to which $z$ can be perturbed, the largest distance $|z-s_o|$ is finite, then we only have to choose the next $z$--as $\Im(z)$ increases--sufficiently large that none of the zeros to which it perturbs could possibly be $s_o.$ Continuing in this way we get an infinite sequence of zeros of C. One possible problem is that one may be drawing a zero of $P$ (or $C$) towards a point which is a zero of $\zeta,$ hence a badly-behaved point of (the analytic continuation of) P. For example, it seems hard to find a path from $C(0.38+12.4~i)= 0$ to $\zeta(.5+14.1~i)=0,$ but by adding a convenient number $z$ we can get a path $C\to C+z \to \zeta+z \to \zeta$ which avoids discontinuities. Since  we have a path from $C(.32+15.4~i)=0$ to $\zeta(0.5+14.1~i)=0$ the mapping is evidently many-to-one, but still would show infinitely many zeros of P and C if the idea is otherwise sound. Example. There is an analytic continuation of $\zeta$ for $\sigma \leq 1.$ There is an analytic continuation of $P$ valid for $ 0 < \sigma. $ The continuation for $P$ obtained by Mobius inversion is $$P(s)= \sum_{k=1}^\infty  \frac{\mu(k)}{k}\log \zeta(k s).$$ Let $P_N(s) = \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{\mu(k)}{k}\log \zeta (k s).$ $\zeta(1/2+56.446... i) = 0.$ $\zeta(.5+55.8~ i) - P_1(.5+55.8 ~i)\approx 0. $ $\zeta(.65+55.8 ~i)-P_2(.65+55.8 ~i)\approx 0.$ ... $\zeta(.64475 +55.8908~ i) -  P_{20}(.64475+55.8908~ i) \approx C(.64475+55.8908 ~i)\approx 0.$ Detail of the above calculation with different zero: perturbing the first nontrivial zero of $\zeta$ to a zero of $\zeta(s)-(\mu(1)/1)\log \zeta(1(s))$ in increments of 1/20. For the table the perturbation begins at the first nontrivial zero of $\zeta\approx (0.5+ 14.13~i).$ $\zeta(a+b~ i)- (m/20)(\mu(1)/1)\log \zeta(1(a+b~i))\approx 0$ $$\begin{array}{c | c | c | }  m & a & b   \\ \hline

1557979,"$\text{Hom}_k(M,N)\cong M^*\otimes_k N$ as Hopf-algebra modules.","I'm reading Representations and Cohomology by D.J. Benson. At the beginning of the third chapter the following is explained: Let $\Lambda$ be a bialgebra over $R$ and $M,N$ left $\Lambda$-modules. We make $M\otimes_R N$ into a $\Lambda$-module as follows: If
$$\Delta(\lambda)=\sum_i \mu_i\otimes \nu_i$$ then 
$$\lambda(m\otimes n)=\sum_i \mu_i(m)\otimes \nu_i(n).$$
We can also make $R$ into a $\Lambda$-module via $\lambda(r)=\varepsilon(\lambda)r$. If $\Lambda$ is a Hopf-algebra over $R$ and $M,N$ are left $\Lambda$-modules, then we make $\text{Hom}_R(M,N)$ into a $\Lambda$-module as follows: If $$\Delta(\lambda)=\sum_i \mu_i\otimes \nu_i$$ and $\phi\in \text{Hom}_R(M,N)$, then 
$$\lambda(\phi)(m)=\sum_i\mu_i(\phi(\eta(\nu_i)(m))),$$
where $\eta$ means the antipode of $\Lambda$.
We write $M^*=\text{Hom}_R(M,R)$. Note that we are viewing $M^*$ as a left $\Lambda$-module. Because of the antipode $\eta$, we can regard right $\Lambda$-modules as left $\Lambda$-modules via $\lambda m = m\eta(\lambda)$ and vice-versa. Now, suppose that $R=k$ is a field and $\Lambda$ is a cocommutative Hopf-algebra. Suppose that $M,N$ are two left $\Lambda$-modules that are finite dimensional as $k$-vector spaces, then the natural vector space isomorphism
$$\text{Hom}_k(M,N)\cong M^*\otimes_kN$$ is a $\Lambda$-module isomorphism. I don't understand why this last statement is true. I know that the natural bijection is given by 
$$f:M^*\otimes_k N\rightarrow \text{Hom}_k(M,N):\phi\otimes w\mapsto \phi(\cdot)w.$$ I only have to show that this map is a $\Lambda$-module morphism. So let $\lambda\in \Lambda$ such that $\Delta(\lambda)=\sum_i\mu_i\otimes \nu_i=\sum_i\nu_i\otimes \mu_i$ (cocommutativity), and we calculate
\begin{eqnarray*}
 (\lambda\cdot f(\phi\otimes w))(v) &=& \sum_i \mu_i(f(\phi\otimes w)(\eta(\nu_i)(v)))\\
&=& \sum_i \mu_i(\phi(\eta(\nu_i)(v))w),\\
f(\lambda\cdot (\phi\otimes w))(v) &=& f(\sum_i (\mu_i\phi)\otimes (\nu_i w))(v)\\
&=& \sum_i (\mu_i\phi)(v)\nu_i w.
\end{eqnarray*} By cocommutativity $\mu_i$ and $\nu_i$ are interchangeable in the calculation, however if I want to proceed, we need to consider $\Delta(\mu_i)$ to calculate $\mu_i\phi$ since $\mu_i\in \Lambda$ and $\phi\in \text{Hom}_k(M,k)$ (which we gave a $\Lambda$-module structure.)

1558132,Markov process and filtration,"I would like to restate the question. I'm reading Revuz/Yor's definition of Markov process (P81), they started from transition function, and define the $P_t f(x)$ as usual (let's only consider the time homogenous case here). A process $X_t$ is called Markov w.r.t $\mathcal F_t$ if $E(f(X_{t+s})|\mathcal F_t) = P_sf(X_t)\tag{1}$ My previous impression had been that, once a transition function is defined, the induced process $X_t$ should be naturally Markov (w.r.t the natural filtration $\mathcal F^X_t$, of course). It is not clear to me, what is the intuition  of using the more general filtration $\mathcal F_t$ in the definition. More specifically, consider $\mathcal F_t = \mathcal F_t^X \vee \mathcal F_t^Y $ where $Y_t$ is another process. If $X_t$ is Markov under $\mathcal F^X_t$, what kind $Y_t$ will make equation(1) hold? Since equation (1) implies that $E(f(X_{t+s})|\mathcal F_t) = E(f(X_{t+s})|\mathcal F_t^X)$ which means, knowing the additional information about $Y$ (up to time $t$) will not change how $X$ evolves after $t$. This seems to suggest that $X$ is somehow independent of $Y$, or $Y$ does not provide additional information on how $X$ will evolve. Is there more accurate (and hopefully non-trivial) characterization of such $Y$? [Below is the old post, will delete later] Suppose $X_t$ is a Markov process with respect to its natural filtration. Let $Y_t$ be another process. Let $\mathcal F_t=\mathcal F_t^{X,Y}$ be the filtration generated by $X_t,Y_t$ jointly. Question: under what condition, is $X_t$ Markovian with respect to $\mathcal F_t$? Intuitively, as long as $\mathcal F_t^Y$ does not have any ""future"" information about $X_t$, it should be OK. So I guess something like $E(f(X_{t+s})|\mathcal{F}_t^Y)\in \mathcal F_t^X$ for any positive or bounded measurable $f$. Thanks [EDIT] Some interesting special cases: 
(1) $X$ and $Y$ are independent. 
(2) $X$ and $Y$ are jointly Markovian. I'm not quite sure about (2). To be more specific, if $X$ is Markovian with respect to the natural filtration, and $(X,Y)$ is also Markovian with respect to the natural filtration, prove: $X_t$ is Markovian with respect to $\mathcal F_t^{X,Y}$ [EDIT] Sorry, keep changing my mind. I guess the above is not true, but need a counter example.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'markov-process', 'stochastic-calculus']"
1558133,Different function with the same derivative,"Today at school I entered in a problem when the professor asked us to differentiate the following function: $$f(x)=\arctan\left(\frac {x-1}{x+1}\right)$$ With the basic rules of differentiation I came to a confusing result: $$f'(x)=\frac 1{1+x^2}$$ And the teacher agreed, and so does Wolfram (I checked at home) but what surprised me is that it's the same derivative as $$f(x)=\arctan x$$
$$f'(x)=\frac 1{1+x^2}$$ So I'm wondering: is that wrong in some sense ? Are the two function equals indeed ? If I integrate $\frac 1{1+x^2}$ what should I choose from the two ? Are there any other examples of different functions with the same derivative?","['derivatives', 'calculus']"
1558160,Definition of the Tangent Space,"I'm watching a series of lectures on differential geometry, and I've run into a bit of a problem with the definition of the tangent space. We first defined a tangent space as $\{(p,v) | v \in \mathbb{R}^n\}$ , which makes sense to me: it's the set of all vectors attached at point $p$ . We then defined the directional derivative as $$
(Df)(p,v) = \lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(p + tv) - f(p)}{t}
$$ We expanded that to this: $$
(Df)(p,v) = \left( \sum_{i = 0}^{n}v_i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\right|_{p}
\right) f$$ This makes sense to me; we have defined the directional derivative as an operator that is applied to the function. Here's the part where I lose the plot. I'm then told that, if I think about it, the portion inside the parentheses is really interchangeable with $(p,v)$ . I'm afraid that I've thought about it, and I can't see the equivalence. $\sum_{i = 0}^{n}v_i \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\right|_{p}$ is an operator (isn't it?) whereas $(p,v)$ is a ordered pair of elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Does that mean that the expression $(p,v)(f)$ makes sense? What would that mean? I must be thinking about this the wrong way; can someone clarify?",['differential-geometry']
1558179,Show $X_1$ and $X_2$ have a common Gaussian distribution,"Anyone has any idea about the following question? Let $\Bbb E(X_1^2)$ and $\Bbb E(X_2^2)$ be finite. Show that if $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent and likewise $X_1+X_2$ and $X_1-X_2$, then both $X_1$ and $X_2$ have a common Gaussian distribution. There is a hint that ""$2x_1 = 2x_1-x_2+x_2$ and $2x_2=2x_2-x_1+x_1$ and then apply central limit theorem four times"", but I still have no idea how to do this.

For what condition of $M$, the quotient ring $R/M$ is finite? My question comes from the theorem: if $M$ is a maximal ideal, then $M$ is a prime ideal. In general, the converse is not true. However, we know that if $M$ is a prime ideal then $R/M$ is an integral domain, and if $R/M$ is also finite, then it is a field, and the converse holds.
