555787,Independence of random variables measure theory,"I wish to show that for two random variables $X$ and $Y$ , the condition $P(X\leq x, Y\leq y ) = P(X\leq x)P(Y\leq y)$ implies that X and Y are independent. I am approaching this problem from a measure theoretic perspective. So in particular I can write that $P(X\leq x) = \mu_X ((-\infty, x])$ and $P(Y\leq y) = \mu_Y ((-\infty, y])$ . Also the independence condition here is that $\sigma(X)$ and $\sigma(Y)$ are independent, where these are the sigma algebras generated by the random variables.","['measure-theory', 'probability']"

Let me write down the proof. PROOF We have pearls of $a$ colours . From these we make necklaces of exactly $p$ pearls . First,we make a string of pearls . There are $a$ $p$ different strings.If we throw away  the $a$ one one -coloured pearls  ($a$ $p$ -$a$) strings will remain.We connect the ends of each string to get necklaces.We find that two strings that differ only by a cyclic permutation of its pearls result in indistinguishable necklaces.But there are $p$ cyclic permutations of $p$ pearls on a string . Hence the number of distinct necklaces is    [($a$ $p$ -$a$)/$p$]. Because of this interpretation this is an integer.Thus ($a$ $p$ -$a$) is a multiple of $p$ for any natural number $a$.

556178,Finding order properties in the relation $aSb \iff \exists k \in \mathbb{N} : b = ak$,"An order relations exercise I just did. I think it's fine, but the second proof felt a bit too wordy or discursive, instead of going straight to the point with brief and accurate statements. How could I improve that? Over $\mathbb{N}^*$ is defined the relation of order $S$: $$aSb \iff \exists k \in \mathbb{N} : b = ak$$ Is $S$ or total order? No. Observe that $\lnot 2 R 3 \land \lnot 3R2$. Demonstrate that $a = 1$ is a minimal and first element. If we always have $a = 1$, then the relation would always check for $$\exists k \in \mathbb{N} : b = k$$ Since $b \in \mathbb{N}^*$, then $b \in \mathbb{N}$, so there will always be a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ that fulfils $b = k$. Thus, $a = 1$ relates to all elements in $\mathbb{N}^*$, which means that $a$ is the first element. Since it is the first element, it is also a minimal element.","['relations', 'discrete-mathematics', 'order-theory']"

I had to count the irreducible, quadratic, monic polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_p[X]$ for arbitrary $p$. I will show you what I tried myself. Research effort First of all the set $\{X^ 2 + bX +c : b, c \in \mathbb{F}_p \}$ contains $p^2$ elemenst. We need to substract the amount of elements that is reducible. These elements are exactly the set $A = \{(X+c)(X+d) : c, d \in \mathbb{F}_p \}$. There are $p(p-1)$ pairs of $(a,b) \in \mathbb{F}_p \times \mathbb{F}_p$ such that $a \neq b$, and there are $p$ pairs such that $a=b$. When $a$ and $b$ are unequal, whe know that $a$ and $b$ can be swapped without changing anything to the polynomial $(X+a)(X+b)$, so I obtained that $|A| \leq p +(p-1)- \frac{1}{2}(p-1)=p-\frac{1}{2}(p-1)$. In other to find out these are the elements, or that there are still less, I thought I had to assume that $(X+c)(X+d) = (X+\gamma)(X+\delta)$, to deduce some information about the realation between $(c,d)$ and $(\gamma, \delta)$, but this led to taking square roots in $\mathbb{F}_p$, and I am not familiar with that.

556195,Must a uniformly continuous function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ have a finite modulus of continuity?,"I searched for similar questions and I could find a duplicate for this. NOTE: I am using the definition of ""modulus of continuity"" as found in Wikipedia for example ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulus_of_continuity ).  Under this definition, any uniformly continuous function has many ""moduli of continuity"".  Some people use a different definition, under which one refers to "" the modulus of continuity of $f$"", and that modulus of continuity satisfies all the requirements that Wikipedia, for example, requires of a modulus of continuity.  It appears that different people use the term slightly differently, and I can't make everyone 100% happy.  I am not claiming Wikipedia is the ultimate authority for math matters, it is just a convenient reference for me at the moment. The title is the question: lacking a good reference, and unable to find one online, I was proving to myself that a uniformly continuous function $f$ with domain and codomain $\mathbb{R}$ has a modulus of continuity $\omega$.  Using the definition of uniformly continuous, I constructed such an $\omega$, and it seems to me that I can prove that $\omega(t)$ is finite for all $t \geq 0$. If this is indeed true, someone has undoubtedly discovered this before, probably one or two centuries ago.  Can anyone provide a reference, or a counterexample in case I'm wrong? If the answer to the title question is ""yes"", I would like some explanation
 why moduli of continuity are allowed to be infinite (finitivity is not part of any definition I have ever seen).  Can anyone cite a good reason?  Perhaps it is useful to allow $\omega$ to be infinite if the domain and/or codomain are infinite-dimensional normed linear spaces (?).   I am not interested in silly, contrived examples, rather examples of uniformly continuous functions between metric spaces (such as familiar function spaces that analysts actually use) with no finite modulus of continuity that are of some interest for some real math problem (not just a counterexample for the sake of a counterexample). EDIT: thinking about it some more, I am pretty sure any uniformly continuous function between any two ""nice"" metric spaces (is connectivity sufficient?) has a finite-valued modulus of continuity, but that leaves open the question of why the definition permits a modulus of continuity to be infinite-valued.  Is it ever convenient to use one that takes infinite values?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'real-analysis']"
556257,Show that two matrices with the same eigenvalues are similar,"First assume that $A$ and $B$ are $p \times p$ matrices and that $\lambda_1,\ldots , \lambda_p$ are distinct eigenvalues of $A$ and $B$. I want to show that $A$ and $B$ are similar. Here is my approach: 
The goal is to show that there is a nonsingular $p \times p$ matrix  $P$ such that $B = P^{-1}A P$.
We know the following is satisfied for each eigenvalue
$$ A \textbf x_j = \lambda_j \textbf x _j  \text { where } j = 1,\ldots,p$$
and $\textbf x_j$ are the eigenvectors. Since $A$ and $B$ share the same eigenvectors, $B$ must satisfy the following 
$$ B \textbf x_j = \lambda_j \textbf x _j  \text { where } j = 1,\ldots,p$$
Thus we have
$$ B \textbf x_j = A \textbf x_j$$
We can take the $\textbf x_j$ as the columns of the matrix $P$ and get
$$BP=AP$$
we know that the columns of $P $ are linearly independent so the matrix must be non singular. Unfortunately this means that 
$$A=B$$
but this is not what we wanted to show. Am I on the right track? Is there an obvious mistake I am making?","['linear-algebra', 'proof-verification']"

[Motivation for the question: I know that the Fourier series of a Holder continuous function converges uniformly to the function.

556473,The measure of the diagonal of a unit square in an alternative measure.,"Usually, we say that the measure of the diagonal of a unit square is 0, but that's with the preassumption the measure is Lebesgue measure in $\mathbb{R}^2$. But what if we are talking about a strange measure where its the product of a 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure and a counting measure? To be precise: Let $X=Y=[0,1]$, $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{B}_{[0,1]}$, $\mu=$Lebesgue measure, and $\nu=$counting measure. If $D=\{(x,x):x\in[0,1]\}$ is the diagonal in $X\times Y$, then what is $(\mu\times\nu)(D)$? According to the definition, it should be the infimum of the measure sum of all the possible ""rectangle"" cover of $D$. But in this measure $\mu\times\nu$, the only rectangles that have finite measures are those with either finite ""height"", or with Lebesgue-null ""width"", but clearly you cannot cover the diagonal with those thin strips (or rather 1-d line segments in the former case). Does that mean this diagonal has a measure $\infty$?",['real-analysis']

556777,motivating the conservation of symplectic area by way of general (coordinate) covariance,"I'm trying to motivate why a symplectic structure captures exactly the right structure one needs to do classical mechanics. The easiest part of this story goes like this: we need a procedure for turning a Hamiltonian into a vector field, the integral curves of which will foliate phase space into orbits. Of course, this criterion alone isn't enough; there are many structures that can fulfill this sort of need -- any old rank-2 tensor field might do. Most people who have read about symplectic geometry on the internet probably know how Henry Cohn fills in the extra details, here: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cohn/Thoughts/symplectic.html The hardest part of the motivation, I think, is explaining why the tensor field that converts the Hamiltonian differential dH into a vector field needs to be alternating. Cohn tells a nice story about how conservation of energy along the flows of a Hamiltonian vector field forces the tensor to be alternating. But I'm wondering whether there isn't an alternative -- perhaps more general -- story to tell, by way of general covariance. Couldn't we just say that if we want Hamilton's equations to be formally invariant under a smooth coordinate change, we need the symplectic area form to be conserved? As I understand it, a ""canonical transformation"" is just a diffeomorphism of phase space coordinates that leaves Hamilton's equations invariant, and Poincare showed that a diffeomorphism is a canonical transformation if and only if it preserves the symplectic area form. My question is -- is all of this right? Is the definition of ""canonical transformation"" really just ""diffeomorphism that leaves Hamilton's equations invariant,"" and is it true that a diffeomorphism on phase space is canonical if and only if it preserves the symplectic area form? It seems to me that this is a much more straightforward way to motivate the at first bizarre-seeming symplectic formalism than is usually given -- because it falls right out of a more general physical principle, diffeomorphism invariance. In other words, it's a top-down motivation (we need symplectic area to be conserved if we're going to be covariant), instead of an unilluminating bottom-up motivation (look, symplectic area happens to be conserved, so we should do everything with a symplectic 2-form!).","['differential-geometry', 'symplectic-geometry', 'mathematical-physics', 'classical-mechanics', 'soft-question']"
556802,Operator with invertible adjoint,"Let $X, Y$ be normed spaces and $T : X \to Y$ bounded and linear,

Is there a simple example for such a non-invertible $T$ with invertible $T^*$? Edit: I found some simple examples in case $X$ is not complete: Let $X$ be a dense, proper subspace of an reflexive space $Z$.
Let $T = i_{X}: X \to X^{**} = Z^{**}$ and $S = i_{X^*} : X^*=Z^* \to X^{***}=Z^{***} $ be the canonical embeddings into the biduals. Then, one can show $T^* = S^{-1}$. Hence, $T^*$ is invertible, but $T$ is not. Therefore, only the case $X$ complete, $Y$ not complete is left.

By Holder's inequality we know that $\int f_nx_1$ is a bounded sequence of real numbers and hence we can find a subsequence $f_n^1$ such that $\int f_n^1 x_1$ converges to a real number $a_1$ . Now again we find that $ \int f_n^1 x_2 $ is a bounded sequence of real numbers and so there is a subsequence $ \{f_n^2\} \subseteq \{f_n^1\} $ for which $\int f_n^2 x_2$ converges to a real number $a_2$ . Continuing this process and taking the diagonal $f_k^k$ we see that given any $x_n$ , $$\lim_{k \to \infty} \int f_k^k x_n= a_n.$$ Also, we may get a linear functional on all of $L^q(X,\mu)$ by setting $$l(x) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \int f_k^k x.$$ My question is: Why is this well-defined, namely why does $\lim_{k \to \infty} \int f_k^k x$ exist?

exp\{ -\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{\mu})^T \Sigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{\mu})  \},
$$ where $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\mu}\in\Re^n$ and $\Sigma \in S_{++}^{n}$. In addition, let $\mathcal{H}: \mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{w}=0$ be a hyperplane in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\Re^n$, where $\mathbf{w}\in\Re^n$ and $b\in\Re$. The hyperplane $\mathcal{H}$ defines two half-spaces: $$
\Omega_{+} = \{\mathbf{x} \in \Re^n | \mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{w}+b \geq 0 \}\\
\Omega_{-} = \{\mathbf{x} \in \Re^n | \mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{w}+b < 0 \}
$$ What I would like to find out is what's happening when I try to integrate the above gaussian pdf over the region $\Omega_{+}$ (or $\Omega_{-}$), as it's well-known that -by definition- integrating over the whole $\Re^n$ gives 1. This is the spirit! And this is the reason of the existence if the (normalisation) term $\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2}|\Sigma|^{1/2}}$. Please correct me if I am wrong in something above. Next, we could observe that if $b=0$, i.e., the hyperplane crosses the origin, then - due to the symmetry of the gaussian pdf - the integral should be equal to $1/2$. But how can I compute the value of the integral when $b\neq0$? Is there some clever trick to compute how the gaussian integral changes with respect to the bias term $b$? Thanks in advance and apologies for being kinda ""newbie"" or not strict enough!...

557017,Closed subspace of $l^\infty$,"I've got here this exercise that says: ""Show that $c$ is a closed subspace of $l^{\infty}$"" (with $c$ I mean the sequences of $l^{\infty}$ that converge in $l^{\infty}$, with respect to the norm of $l^{\infty}$). I've done it, but I cannot say if it is correct. In order to show that $c$ is a closed subspace of $l^{\infty}$, I have to prove that any convergent sequence $\{c_n\}_n$ of elements of $c$ converges to $x\in c$. I know that, since $l^{\infty}$ is complete, $\{c_n\}$ converges to $x\in l^{\infty}$, so it is enough prove that $x\in c$.
Since $\{c_n\}$ converges to $x\in l^{\infty}$, we have that $||c_n-x||_\infty\to 0$ for $n\to \infty$, i.e. $\sup_{j\in \mathbb{N}}|c_n-x|\to 0$ (here $j$ runs over the elements of the sequence $c_n-x$), i.e. for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists $N>0$ such that $\sup_{j\in \mathbb{N}}|c_n-x|<\epsilon$ for $n>N$. Now, since $c_n\in c$, we have that $c_n\to \xi\in l^{\infty}$ for $n\to \infty$, and so for every $\epsilon>0$ \begin{equation*}
\sup_{j\in \mathbb{N}}|\lim_{n\to \infty}(c_n-x)|=\sup_{j\in \mathbb{N}}|\xi-x|<\epsilon, 
\end{equation*} which means that $x\in c$. What do you think? Is there anybody that could suggest me a different argument?",['functional-analysis']

557063,"If $f$ is integrable on every set of finite measure then $f=f_1+f_2$ where $f_1$ is integrable, $f_2$ is bounded","If $f$ is measurable on $\mathbb R$ and integrable on every subset of $\mathbb R$ with  finite measure, the claim is that it can be written as a sum of an integrable function $f_1$ and a bounded one $f_2$. My first idea was to use the intervals $[n,n+1]$ somehow. But then I noted that this might be not enough: consider for example $e^x$. For every such interval it is integrable, however it can't be written as such a sum. If it could, then $f_2 \leq M$ for some $M$ and for $e^x>M$ we would have $f_1 > e^x-M$ and therefore $f_1$ would not be integrable. But this example leaves only two options: either the claim is false, or $e^x$ does not have the property that it is integrable in every set of finite measure. So I thought about it and, if my calculations are correct, then if $q_n$ is an enumeration of the rational numbers, the set $A=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}(q_n-\frac{1}{2^n},q_n+\frac{1}{2^n})$ has finite measure, while the integral of $e^x$ over $A$ is infinite. Therefore the claim may be true. Another intuitive idea that I had, was that if $f$ has such a property, then there must exist a number $M$ such that the integral of $f$ over the set $\{x\in\mathbb R : |f(x)|>M\}$ sould be finite. But I couldn't prove such a thing. Thanks for any help! UPDATE I think I found a proof that this is true. Take the sequence of sets $A_n = \{x\in \mathbb R: |f(x)| > 2^n\}$. These are all measurable because $f$ is measurable. Suppose that they all have infinite measure. Then, choose $B_n \subset A_n$ with $m(B_n) = \frac{1}{2^n}$ and all $B_n$'s pairwise disjoint. Then, $m(\bigcup B_n) = 1$ but $\int_{\bigcup B_n} |f| dm = \sum \int_{B_n} |f| dm > \sum \int_{B_n} 2^n dm = \sum 2^n m(B_n) = \sum 1 = \infty$ which contradicts the fact that $f$ is integrable on every set of finite measure. Therefore there is an $k$ such that $A_k$ has finite measure. Define $f_2(x) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       f(x) & : x \in \mathbb R \setminus A_k\\
       0 & : x \in A_k
     \end{array}
   \right.$
and
$f_1(x) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       0 & : x \in \mathbb R \setminus A_k\\
       f(x) & : x \in A_k
     \end{array}
   \right.$
then obviously $f=f_1+f_2$, $f_2 \leq 2^k$ thus $f_2$ is bounded and $\int_{\mathbb R} |f_1| dm = \int_{A_k} |f_1| dm = \int_{A_k} |f| dm < \infty$ because $m(A_k)$ is finite. Is this correct?",['measure-theory']

557381,What is the exact motivation for the Minkowski metric?,"In introductory texts about Lorentz Geometry, one always learns about the Minkowski space, i.e. $R^4$ with the Minkowski metric $$ m(x, y) := -x_0 y_0 + x_1y_1 + x_2y_2+ x_3 y_3  $$ Using this metric, one can define lightcones $\{x \in R^4 \mid m(x, x) = 0 \}$ and timecones $\{x \in R^4 \mid m(x, x) < 0\}$. The existence of these cones is then physically interpreted as the fact that no particle can move faster than light. But - thinking the other way around - why exactly do I have to use the Minkowski metric to formalize this fact? These cones can be defined also without reference to any metric. I could use $R^4$ with Euclidean metric as my mathematical model of reality. The fact that no particle moves faster than a certain bound is then modelled by the fact that the tangent vectors of curves are within these cones. Is there an instructive way to see why one has to take the Minkowski metric on $R^4$? Idea: Maybe the Euclidean metric conflicts with the fact that the speed of light is the same in any reference frame? But how to make this formally precise? How to define speed then?","['semi-riemannian-geometry', 'soft-question', 'differential-geometry']"
557398,Is this ODE solvable?,"this equation popped up when I was trying to apply math: $$Af^2+B\left(\frac{df}{dx}\right)^2=C$$ Where $A,B,C$ are positive constants. Also,  $~f(0)=D$, another positive constant. What are the solutions? Is this solvable? If not, are there any texts you recommend to read? BTW you might want to know background: I am solving for the maximum velocity profile $v(s)$ for a car traveling on a curved path $\gamma(s)$ under the constraint that the max passenger g force, call it $\sqrt{C}$, is not exceeded. This results in
$$\sqrt{g_l^2+g_r^2}=\sqrt{C}~~\to~~\left(\frac{v^2}{r}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dv}{dt}\right)^2=C$$
Where $r$ is the radius of curvature at the point $\gamma(s)$. I then made the substitution $f=v^2$ to get to an equation analogous to the one above. Also, I took $r$ to be piecewise (which is a good approximation in my usage case), which is why $A$ is constant.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
557402,"""Graded free"" is stronger than ""graded and free""?","This topic suggested me the following question: If $R$ is a commutative graded ring and $F$ a graded $R$-module which is free, then can we conclude that $F$ has a homogeneous basis (that is, a basis consisting of homogeneous elements)? In general the answer is negative, and such an example can be found in Nastasescu, Van Oystaeyen, Methods of Graded Rings , page 21. But their example is not quite usual, and I'd like to know if however the property holds for positively graded $K$-algebras, for example. If not, then maybe someone can provide a generic example when the property holds.","['commutative-algebra', 'graded-rings', 'graded-modules', 'abstract-algebra']"

557426,How to efficiently encode this?,"I have 5 ring oscillators whose frequencies are f1, f2, ..., f5. Each ring oscillator (RO) has 5 inverters. For each RO, I just randomly pick 3 inverters out of 5 inverters. For example, in RO1, I pick inverter 1,3,5 (Notation: RO1(1,3,5)). So I have the following: RO1(1,3,5) (I call this is the configuration of RO1) RO2(1,2,4) (configuration of RO2) RO3(2,4,5) RO4(1,4,5) RO5(2,3,4) Let say f1 < f3 < f4 < f5 < f2 (I call this is a rank). So for this particular rank, I have: {RO1(1,3,5), RO3(2,4,5), RO4(1,4,5), RO5(2,3,4), RO2(1,2,4)} For a different rank, let say f1 < f2 < f3 < f4 < f5, I will have: {RO1(1,3,5), RO2(1,2,4), RO3(2,4,5), RO4(1,4,5), RO5(2,3,4)} So as you can see, the rank affects how things are arranged. One trivial encoding is: {RO1(1,3,5), RO3(2,4,5), RO4(1,4,5), RO5(2,3,4), RO2(1,2,4)} = 000...00 (all zeros) {RO1(1,2,5), RO3(2,4,5), RO4(1,4,5), RO5(2,3,4), RO2(1,2,4)} = 000...01 (all zeros with a single 1) etc ... (repeat the whole process until we exhaust all combinations for all configurations for all ranks). This trivial encoding is NOT efficient because I need to store the entire mapping table in memory so that later on, I can use it for encoding. My question is: Is there a better way to carry out the encoding without having access to the entire mapping table? Clarification: For 5 ROs, there are 5! different possible ranks. So I will need ceiling(log(5!))=7 bits (log here is base-2) to encode 5! different ranks. Each RO has (5 choose 3) different possible configurations. So for 5 ROs, there are (5 choose 3)^5=10^5 possible configuration combinations. Therefore, I will need ceiling(log(10^5))=17 bits to encode all possible combinations. So let me re-state my question in a clearer way: Given a specific rank of 5 ROs and the configurations of 5 ROs, how can I efficiently encode those information into 24 bits?","['coding-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms', 'computer-science', 'transformation']"
