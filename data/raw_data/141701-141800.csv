2293539,Can Sobolev spaces with $1 \le p < 2$ be defined in terms of Fourier transforms?,"By Plancherel's Theorem, we can define the Sobolev space $W^{k,2}(\mathbb{R})$ using Fourier transforms as $$W^{k,2} (\mathbb{R}) = \left\{ f \in \mathcal{S}' \ | \ \mathscr{F}^{-1}\left[ \left( 1 + \lvert \xi \rvert^2 \right)^{k/2} \mathscr{F}[f]\right] \in L^2(\mathbb{R}) \right\}$$ equivalently to the definition for general $p\ge 1$ $$W^{k,p}(\mathbb{R}) = \left\{ f \in L^p(\mathbb{R}) \ | \ \frac{d^if}{dx^i} \in L^p(\mathbb{R}), \ 1 \le i \le k \right\} \, ,$$ if we set $p=2$. My question is whether it is possible to define $W^{k,p}(\mathbb{R})$ using Fourier transforms when $p \ne 2$.  Using the Riesz-Thorin interpolation theorem as discussed in this MathSE question and answer , we can extend the Fourier transform to a (non-surjective) bounded linear transformation $L^p \to L^q$ for $1 \le p \le 2$ (where $q$ is the Holder conjugate of $p$).  As discussed in this book chapter (p178) , we can invert the Fourier transform on its range in $L^q$. Is this enough that we can define Sobolev spaces for $1 \le p < 2$ in terms of Fourier transforms as we can when $p=2$?","['functional-analysis', 'sobolev-spaces', 'fourier-transform']"
2293602,Approximating an integral as a parameter grows large,"I am trying to calculate the following integral : $$I(\lambda,\alpha)=\int_{\lambda}^1 \mathrm{d}\tau \frac{1-\tau^\alpha}{1-\tau}\exp(-k \tau)$$ where $\lambda<1$, $k$ is a positive constant and $\alpha$ is a large integer. I was thinking of doing the substitution $y=\alpha (1-\tau)$, in which case the integral becomes : $$e^{-k}\int_0^{\alpha(1-\lambda)}\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{y}\left(1-\left(1-\frac{y}{\alpha}\right)^\alpha\right)\exp{\left(\frac{ky}{\alpha}\right)}  $$ and I expect at some point to say that for large $\alpha$, then $(1-\frac{y}{\alpha})^\alpha\simeq e^{-y}$, but this is false when $y$ is close to $\alpha(1-\lambda)$.

2293714,Equality/Equivalence of functions,"When we say something like: 
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = x$$
we're describing the way a function $y$ changes with respect to $x$. 
To solve the differential equation we integrate both sides. Is there a proper way to do this, or is it simply the case that if have a reliable method to get the correct answer then that's fine. For example: Method 1:
$$ \int\frac{dy}{dx} dx = \int x \, dx$$
$$ \int dy= \int x \, dx$$
$$ y + c_1 = \frac{x^2}{2} + c_2$$ Method 2: 
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = x$$
$$ dy = x \, dx$$
$$ \int dy= \int x \, dx$$
$$ y + c_1 = \frac{x^2}{2} + c_2$$ This is the thinking that lead me to the question to the title. Why is it okay to integrate both sides of an equation? Are we basing that on the fact that indefinite integration is simply the reverse of differentiation? Will integrating both sides always make sense with continuous, integrable, elementary functions? Can we integrate without respect to a variable? In method 2 I employed the integration operator on both sides without adding a differential (I know it was already there). If I write $ y'' + 5xy = 2x^2$, is it acceptable to integrate both sides of the equation with respect to y, or x, and get a valid equality as a result? When I write: $ xy + y^x = 2x + 3$, maybe this is bad example, but am I stating that the left side is the same as the right side, or am I proposing that there are certain values of x and y that satisfy that equation. I'm having sort of a fundamental crisis here. I don't think I was ever properly taught what equality means.

2293856,Blow-up and exceptional divisor,"I am trying to compute the exceptional divisor of the affine singularity $x^2 + y^2 + z^4 = 0$. First, I take the chart $U_1$ with coordinates $x,y_1,z_1$ verifying $ y = y_1x, z = z_1x$. The equation is $x^2(1 + y_1^2 + z_1^4x) = 0$, so the strict transform is smooth and the exceptional divisor $E_1$ has equation $ \{ (0,\pm i, t) : t \in \Bbb C \}$. Now, let's take the chart $U_2$ with coordinates $z, x = x_2z, y = y_2z$. The equation is $z^2(x_2^2 + y_2^2 + z^2) = 0$, the strict transform is singular and the exceptional divisor is $E_2 = \{ (t, \pm it, 0) : t \in \Bbb C\}$. We have $E_1 = E_2$ and it is corresponds to two copies of $P^1$ intersecting transversally. We do a second blow-up in the chart $U_2$, with respect to the coordinate $x_2$, i.e we have a third chart $U_3$ with new coordinates are $x_2, y_3,z_3$ where $y_2 = x_2y_3, z_2 = z_3x_2$. The equation is $ x_2^2(1 + y_3^2 + z_3^2) = 0$. This is smooth so we don't need to blow-up anymore. The exceptional divisor $E_3$ is given by $x_2 = 0, 1 + y_3^2 + z_3^2 = 0$. It is a plane conic, i.e $E_3 \cong P^1$. I want to compute $E_3 \cap E_2$. Coordinates $U_2$ and $U_3$ are related by $y_3 = y_2x_2^{-1}, z_3 = x_2z, x_2 = x_2$. In particular, $U_2 \cap U_3 = \{(x_2,zy_2,z) : x_2 \neq 0)\}$. Since $E_3$ was defined as $x_2 = 0, 1 + y_3^2 + z_3^2 = 0$ we have $E_3 \cap E_2 = \emptyset$ in this chart. Similary I got that $E_3 \cap E_2 = \emptyset$ in the other charts (I can add details if necessary). So I get that the exceptional divisor is $E_2 \sqcup E_3$. But by toric geometry I I should get $3$ copies of $P^1$, with one intersecting the two other transversally, which is clearly not what I did obtain.

2294117,"How to tell which manifolds can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$, for a given $n$?","Given $k \leq n$, is there a general method that can help us determine whether a given $k-$ dimensional smooth manifold $M$ (let's assume $M$ has empty boundary) can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$?

2294130,Reference for rigorous treatment of the representation theory of the Lorentz group,"When I studied representation theory for the first time it was only focused on finite groups. It was the second half of a one semester course in group theory, and the book employed was ""Representation Theory: A First Course"" by Harris and Fulton. Currently I'm studying Quantum Field Theory, and regarding spinors and quantum fields with spin, I'm interested in the representation theory of the Lorentz group. I know the description of the fields with various spins is tightly connected to the irreducible representations of the Lorentz group. Unfortunately, though, most traditional textbooks in QFT take a stand to not do a rigorous treatment of the matter, nor present a mathematicaly pleasant notation or definitions. Most of them speak quite loosely of the subject, that it doesn't even look connected to the representation theory I saw in the course I took. Considering this, what I'm looking for is a book or lecture notes which presents a mathematicaly rigorous approach to the representation theory of the Lorentz group and also establish in a mathematicaly correct way the connection to quantum fields with spin and the representations of the Lorentz group.

2294137,Domains in First-order logic,"I’m a master’s student in mathematics with two questions about logic. I have taken a course in first-order logic (basically covering soundness and completeness) a few years ago, but I have to admit that my understanding of logic is weak. These are my questions: In first-order logic, an interpretation $\mathcal{A}$ consist of a ”non-empty universe of discourse” $A$, together with some functions and relations on $A$. Formally, how do we know which objects qualify as ”non-empty universes of discourse”? I will call $A$ the domain of $\mathcal{A}$. To answer my own question 1, I guess which objects qualify to be used as domains is decided by what metatheory we are using: For example if we work with models of ZFC, we typically want our domain to be something like the von Neumann universe $V$. To be allowed to use $V$ as the domain of our model, we use ZFC together with some additional axioms as our metatheory, probably to guarantee to ""existence"" of $V$.

2294233,Setwise convergence with martingales,"Can someone please tell me whether the following reasoning is correct and/or help me conclude? Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space equipped with a filtration $\{\mathcal{F}_n \}_n \uparrow \mathcal{F}$, and let $\{P_n\}_n$ be a sequence of probability measures that is uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to $P$. Suppose the following condition holds: for all $n$ and $F \in \mathcal{F}_n$,
\begin{equation}\tag{1} P_n(F) = P_{n+1}(F). \end{equation} I want to show that $\{P_n\}_n$ converges setwise to a probability measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to $P$. Let $X_n = \frac{dP_n|_{\mathcal{F}_n}}{dP|_{\mathcal{F}_n}}$ be the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $P_n$ with respect to $P$ restricted to $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}_n)$. Then $\{X_n \}_n$ is a nonnegative martingale because each $X_n$ is integrable, $\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable and if $F \in \mathcal{F}_n \subset \mathcal{F}_{n+1}$, then (1) implies
$$\int_F X_n dP = P_n(F) = P_{n+1}(F) = \int_F X_{n+1}dP.$$
Therefore, $\{X_n\}_n$ converges almost surely to a nonnegative integrable limit $X_\infty$. So $P_\infty$ defined by $P_\infty(A)=\int_A X_\infty dP$ is a measure. Now let $F \in \cup_n \mathcal{F}_n$. For all sufficiently large $n$,
$$P_n(F) = \int_F X_n dP,$$
so
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} P_n(F) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_F X_n dP = \int_F X_\infty dP = P_\infty(F),$$
where the interchange of limit and integral is justified by the uniform integrability of $\{X_n \}_n$, which is equivalent to the uniform absolute continuity of $\{P_n \}_n$. It's clear from the above that $P_\infty(\Omega)=1$. We have shown that $\{ P_n\}_n$ converges setwise to $P_\infty$ on $\cup_n \mathcal{F}_n$, and I'd like to conclude by asserting that since $\cup_n \mathcal{F}_n$ is a pi-system that generates $\mathcal{F}$, $\{P_n \}_n$ converges setwise to $P_\infty$ on all of $\mathcal{F}$. I think that this follows from the pi-lambda theorem, but it would be great if someone could confirm that.","['martingales', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'probability-theory']"

He repeatedly claims that much of statistics is a giant mess, and argues that many commonplace statistical techniques are ad hoc devices which lack a strong theoretical footing. He blames historical giants like Karl Pearson and Ronald Fisher for the field's sorry state, and champions Bayesian methods as a healthier alternative. From my personal perspective, his arguments make a lot of sense. However, there are a number of factors that prevent me from taking his criticism of statistics at face value. Despite the book's being published in 2003, the majority of its contents were written in the mid 20th century, making it a little dated. The field of statistics is reasonably young, and I'm willing to bet it's changed significantly since he levied his critiques. Furthermore, I'm skeptical of how he paints statistics as having these giant methodological rifts between ""frequentists"" and ""Bayesians."" From my experience with other fields, serious methodological disagreement between professionals is almost nonexistent, and where it does exist it is often exaggerated. I'm also always skeptical of anyone who asserts that an entire field is corrupt--scientists and mathematicians are pretty intelligent people, and it's hard to believe that they were as clueless during Jaynes's lifetime as he claims. Questions: Can anyone tell me if Jaynes's criticisms of statistics were valid in the mid 20th century, and furthermore whether they are applicable to statistics in the present day? For example, do serious statisticians still refuse to assign probabilities to different hypotheses, merely because those probabilities don't correspond to any actual ""frequencies?""

$$M=\begin{bmatrix}m_{11}&0\\0&m_{22}\end{bmatrix},$$
where $m_{ii}\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. Since $M$ is constant, I know that the geodesic curve $\gamma:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^2$ is a straight line. Thus, 
$$\dfrac{d\gamma}{ds}\equiv C,$$
where $C$ is a constant real value. Consequently, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that the equality
\begin{equation}
\gamma(s) = \gamma(0) + \int_0^s C\,ds

holds, for every $s\in[0,1]$. In terms of local coordinates. The Riemannian metric is defined, for every $x=(x_1, x_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2$, on the space tangent to $\mathbb{R}^2$ as $\mathbb{R}^2\ni(\delta x_1, \delta x_2)\to\delta x_1^\top M\delta x_2\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$, where $\delta x_i$ stands for the components of the vector tangent to $x$.

		& = \dfrac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C} \dfrac{f^{'}(1+\frac{g}{f})+f(1+\frac{g}{f})^{'}}{f(1+\frac{g}{f})}dz\\
		&= \dfrac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C} \dfrac{f^{'}}{f}dz + \dfrac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{C}\dfrac{(1+\frac{g}{f})^{'}}{1+\frac{g}{f}}dz\\
		&= Z(f)  + \dfrac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{C}\dfrac{(1+\frac{g}{f})^{'}}{1+\frac{g}{f}}dz\\
\end{aligned}$ Since we are dealing with a compact set in $\mathbb{C}$, we have $|g|$ and $|f|$ to be both bounded in the circle $C$. Consequently, $\left|\dfrac{g}{f}\right|$ is bounded in $C$. Assume that $f$ has zeros $z_1,z_2,...,z_n$, and since $\left|\dfrac{g}{f}\right|$ is bounded in each deleted neighborhood of an isolated singularity, the singularity is removable. Consequently, $\dfrac{g}{f}$ is analytic in and on $C$. It follows that $1+\dfrac{g}{f}$ is analytic in and on $C$. Next we look at if there are any singularities in $C$ for the function $\dfrac{(1+\frac{g}{f})^{'}}{1+\frac{g}{f}}$. The singularities of this will occur iff $$1+\dfrac{g}{f} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \dfrac{g}{f} = -1 \Leftrightarrow f = -g \Leftrightarrow |f| = |-g| = |g|$$ Thus this leads to a contradiction as our hypothesis and extreme value theorem says $|g| < |f|\leq M$ on the boundary, by the maximum modulus, the maximum of $|g|$ occurs on the boundary and hence we are sure that inside the circle $C$, $|g| < |f| \leq M$ as well. Hence there are no zeros or singularities inside the $C$ as $1+\dfrac{g}{f}$ is non vanishing. Hence we have $\dfrac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{C}\dfrac{(1+\frac{g}{f})^{'}}{1+\frac{g}{f}}dz = 0$ by Cauchy Goursat. Consequently, $Z(f+g) = Z(f)$",['complex-analysis']

2294889,Is my paper on a number system that allows arithmetic on 3D vectors useful?,"I have constructed a number system similar to the quaternions, but with three dimensions, not four, ie vectors of the form $(x, y, z)$. It has fairly well-behaved multiplication and division and every non-zero element has an inverse. My algebra is not commutative, not associative and it only obeys the distributive law on one side. Where can I publish my paper on this number system? My corrected paper is here: http://soler7.com/IFAQ/Ternions.doc Definition of vector multiplication If $v$ and $q$ are two vectors, $v = (a, b, c)$ and $q = (x, y, z)$, then their product, $vq = (a, b, c)(x, y, z)$ is defined to be $$ (ax - by - cz, b|q| + yw, c|q| + zw ), $$ where $|q| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ and $$ w = a + \frac{(by + cz)(x - |q|)}{(y^2 + z^2)} $$ provided $y$ or $z$ is non-zero. If $y$ and $z$ are both zero then $vq = (xa, xb, xc)$. The reciprocal of the vector is given by $$ (x, y, z)^{-1} = |q|^{-2}(x, -y, -z). $$ Proof that this acts as the reciprocal of $q$ on the right. $$ qq^{-1} = (x, y, z)|q|^{-2}(x, -y, -z) = |q|^{-2}(x, y, z)(x, -y, -z) $$ using the definition of multiplication, i.e. $$ (a, b, c)(x, y, z) = (ax - by - cz, b|q| + yw, c|q| + zw), $$ we obtain \begin{align*}
  qq^{-1}
  &= |q|^{-2} \left(
  \begin{gathered}
    x^2 + y^2 + z^2, \\
  y|q| - y\Bigl(x + \frac{(-y^2 -z^2)(x - |q|)}{y^2 + z^2}\Bigr), \\
  z|q| - z\Bigl(x + \frac{(-y^2 -z^2)(x - |q|)}{y^2 + z^2}\Bigr)
  \end{gathered}
  \right) \\
  &= |q|^{-2} \bigl(x^2 + y^2 + z^2,\ y|q| - yx + y(x - |q|),\ z|q| - zx + z(x - |q|)\bigr) \\
  &= |q|^{-2}(x^2 + y^2 + z^2, 0, 0) \\
  &= (1, 0, 0)
\end{align*} as required. Proof that that $|q|^{-2}(x, -y, -z)$ acts as the reciprocal of $q$ on the left. $$ q^{-1}q = |q|^{-2}(x, -y, -z)(x, y, z). $$ Using the definition of multiplication: \begin{align*}
  q^{-1}q
  &= |q|^{-2}\left(
  \begin{gathered}
    x^2 + y^2 + z^2, \\
  - y|q| + y\Bigl(x + \frac{(- y^2 - z^2)(x - |q|)}{y^2 + z^2}\Bigr), \\
  - z|q| + z\Bigl(x + \frac{(- y^2 - z^2)(x - |q|)}{y^2 + z^2}\Bigr)
  \end{gathered}
  \right) \\
  &= |q|^{-2} \bigl(x^2 + y^2 + z^2, -y|q| + yx - y(x - |q|), -z|q| + zx  - z(x - |q|)\bigr) \\
  &= (1, 0, 0)
\end{align*} as required. So the vector $|q|^{-2}(x, -y, -z)$ behaves correctly as the reciprocal of $(x, y, z)$ on both the left and the right. All non-zero vectors have reciprocals. If $y = z = 0$ but $x$ is non-zero, then the reciprocal of $(x, 0, 0)$ is simply $(1/x, 0, 0)$. Although I am saddened to see that my number system is not associative, I am very grateful to Arctic Tern for pointing this out. The beauty and terror of mathematics is that when you are right, no-one can contradict you, and when you are wrong there is no come-back from that either. All I can do is acknowledge the correctness of everything that Arctic Tern has written. Incidentally, I am very impressed by the level of helpfulness and the positive attitude that is the case here on stackexchange. It is a lovely contrast to the acrimony and pettiness that is so common on other parts of the Net. In particular, I am grateful that people have overlooked my clumsy notation. In the future I promise to use Latex! Geometry may be basic to mathematics and to mathematical intuition, but unfortunately it is my Achilles heel. I had to laboriously work out the products of (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1) to see that (aa)b is not equal to a(ab), just as Arctic Tern asserted. I have to withdraw my comment about wikipedia, as my system is not a near-field. Maybe it is a near-near-field? I have one lingering question, namely where is the error in my faulty proof of associativity? It goes like this: ""The associative law holds for ternion multiplication because, apart from a modulus adjustment, which is clearly associative, it does nothing other than a three-dimensional rotation. Three-dimensional rotations form a group, which means that they are associative."" I agree that someone else has probably discovered the same number system. I have looked, but was unable to find it. Also, what did Arctic Tern mean by ""with only partially retained versions"" in the 5th paragraph under ""some more comments""?","['abstract-algebra', 'quaternions', 'rotations', 'division-algebras']"

2294987,Commuting Laplacian and Divergence,"I'm trying to understand why
$$\Delta(\nabla f) - \nabla(\Delta f) = (n - 1) \text{Ric}(\nabla f),$$
where I'm working on a Riemannian manifold, $\Delta$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator, $\nabla$ is the gradient, and $\text{Ric}(\cdot)$ is the linear map on vector fields induced by
$$\langle \text{Ric}(X),Y \rangle = \text{Ric}(X,Y),$$
where $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ is the metric and $\text{Ric}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the Ricci tensor. Let $\{E_{1},\dots,E_{n}\}$ be a local orthonormal frame on $M$.  Appealing to the definitions, we obtain
\begin{align*}
\langle \Delta(\nabla f), E_{k} \rangle - \langle \nabla(\Delta f), E_{k} \rangle &= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, E_{k} \rangle - \langle \nabla_{\nabla_{E_{i}} E_{i}} \nabla f, E_{k} \rangle - E_{k}(\langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, E_{i} \rangle) \\
			&= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} E_{i}(\langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, E_{k} \rangle) - \langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{i}} E_{k} \rangle - \langle \nabla_{E_{k}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{i}} E_{i} \rangle \\
			&\quad - \langle \nabla_{E_{k}} \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, E_{i} \rangle - \langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{k}} E_{i} \rangle
\end{align*}
Above we used the fact that $\nabla^{2} f$ is symmetric to obtain $\langle \nabla_{\nabla_{E_{i}} E_{i}} \nabla f, E_{k} \rangle = \langle \nabla_{E_{k}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{i}} E_{i} \rangle$.  By symmetry, we also find $E_{i}(\nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, E_{k} \rangle) = E_{i}(\nabla_{E_{k}} \nabla f, E_{i} \rangle)$.  Thus,
\begin{align*}
\langle \Delta(\nabla f), E_{k} \rangle - \langle \nabla(\Delta f), E_{k} \rangle &= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla_{E_{k}} \nabla f, E_{i} \rangle + \langle \nabla_{E_{k}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{i}} E_{i} \rangle - \langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{i}} E_{k} \rangle \\

		&= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla_{E_{k}} \nabla f, E_{i} \rangle - \langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{i}} E_{k} \rangle  - \langle \nabla_{E_{k}} \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, E_{i} \rangle \\
		&\quad - \langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{k}} E_{i} \rangle 
\end{align*}
Now I'm confused because there appears to be a sign error.  If the last term were $\langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{k}} E_{i} \rangle$ without the minus sign, then I could combine it with $-\langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{i}} E_{k} \rangle$ to get
$$\langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{k}} E_{i} \rangle - \langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{i}} E_{k} \rangle = \langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, [E_{k},E_{i}] \rangle$$
by symmetry of the Levi-Civita connection.  Using symmetry of $\nabla^{2}f$, this yields
$$\langle \nabla_{[E_{k},E_{i}]} \nabla f, E_{i} \rangle,$$
which is exactly the term I need to get $\langle R(E_{k},E_{i})\nabla f, E_{i}\rangle$ and then conclude. Nonetheless, if I used a geodesic frame, then I could assume $\nabla_{E_{i}} E_{j} = 0$ at some point $p$ and then the whole computation goes through since the offending terms vanish and the $\nabla_{[E_{k},E_{i}]} \nabla f$ term would also vanish (again, symmetry of Levi-Civita).  So what I have so far works if I use a geodesic frame.  That seems weird: working backwards, this seems to mean $\langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{k}} E_{i} \rangle = - \langle \nabla_{E_{i}} \nabla f, \nabla_{E_{k}} E_{i} \rangle$ in the general case, which implies that quantity vanishes, but I can't see why it should. Did I make a sign error above?  If not, how do I complete the computation if I don't want to assume I'm working with a geodesic frame?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

  $$I_n=\int_0^{\pi/2} \underbrace{\cos(\cos(\cos(\dots(\cos}_{n \text{ times}}(x))\dots)))~dx \tag{1}$$ I have already evaluated closed forms to this integral for certain values of $n$, however I am still missing a closed form for a large number of values of $n$. Those in $\color{red}{\text{red}}$ I numerically evaluated, meaning that I currently do not have a closed form for them.
$$\begin{array}{c|c}n&I_n\\\hline0&\dfrac{\pi^2}{8}\\1&1\\2&\dfrac{\pi J_0(1)}{2}\\\color{red}{3}&\color{red}{\approx 1.11805}\\\color{red}{4}&\color{red}{\approx 1.18186} \\ \color{red}{5} & \color{red}{\approx 1.14376} \\ \color{red}{6}&\color{red}{\approx 1.17102}\\\color{red}{\vdots}&\color{red}{\vdots}\\\infty&\alpha\cdot \dfrac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.16095\end{array}$$
Where $J_p(\cdot )$ is the Bessel function of the first kind , and $\alpha$ is the Dottie Number . The cases $n=0$ and $n=1$ are trivial, hence I will not show how I derived these solutions. Hence, I will show how I derived the case where $n=2$ and $n\to \infty$. Evaluating $I_2$: i.e $\int_0^{\pi/2} \cos(\cos(x))~dx$. Introducing the definition of the Bessel Function of the first kind:
$$J_{\beta}(z)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^{\pi} \cos(z\sin{\theta}-\beta \theta)~d\theta$$
We can use the substitution $\theta=u+\frac{\pi}{2}$ to obtain: $$\begin{align} J_{\beta}(z)&=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos\left(z\sin\left(u+\frac{\pi}{2}\right)-\beta\left(u+\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\right)~du\\&=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos\left(z\cos(u)-\beta\left(u+\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\right)~du \end{align}$$
To get it into a similar form to our case, notice that we can let $\beta=0$ and $z=1$. Therefore:
$$J_0(1)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(\cos(u))~du$$
At first sight, it may seem like the bounds are problematic. However, note that $f(x)=\cos(\cos(x))$ is an even function, hence we know that:
$$J_0(1)=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^{\pi/2} \cos(\cos(u))~du \iff \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos(\cos(u))~du=\frac{\pi J_0(1)}{2}$$ Evaluating $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} I_n$: I realized that as $n\to \infty$, the integrand will converge to a constant function for all $x\in \mathbb{R}$, as shown below. The blue, yellow, green and red curves is when $n=1,2,5,10$ respectively. I figured that we can represent the repeated composition of functions by the following recurrence $x_{n+1}=\cos(x_n)$. Using the principles of fixed point iteration, we know thus know that the value it tends to is the unique solution to $x=\cos(x)$. This turns out to be the Dottie Number , which I evaluated numerically using the Newton-Raphson Method and denoted this value by $\alpha$. I obtained:
$$\alpha\approx 0.739085133215161$$
Hence:
$$\lim_{n\to \infty} I_n=\int_0^{\pi/2}\cos(\cos(\cos(\dots(\cos(x))\dots)))~dx=\alpha\cdot \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.160952212443092$$ As mentioned, I am unsure how to evaluate closed forms for the cases when $n\geq 3$.
