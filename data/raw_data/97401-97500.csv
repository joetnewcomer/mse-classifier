1343878,second fundamental form and connection forms,"I am reading this paper that has the following: Suppose $M$ is an (n-1) dimensional closed hyper surface immersed in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Let $e_1, \cdots, e_n$ be orthonormal frame in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $e_1,\cdots, e_{n-1}$ are tangent to $M$ and $e_n$ is the outer normal. Let $\omega_i$ be the corresponding coframes and $\omega_{i,j}$ be the connection forms. And use the same notation for the pull back of the forms through immersion. Then the second fundamental form is defined by the symmetric matrix $\{h_{ij}\}$ with $$\omega_{i,n+1}=h_{ij}\omega_j.$$ I use Boothby's An introduction to differentiable manifolds and Riemannian geometry for reference on differential geometry. In this book, the notations are like this: $e_1,\cdots,e_n$ are the orthonormal frames. $\omega^i$ are the coframes. (so I figured this is equal to $\omega_i$ in the paper.) $\omega_{j}^{k}$ are defined so that $\nabla_{X} e_j = \Sigma_k \omega_{j}^{k}(X)e_k$, where $X$ is a vector field. $\omega_{i,j}=\Sigma_k \omega_{i}^kg_{kj}$. In this case, since this is an orthonormal frame, I guess $\omega_{i,j}=\omega_i^j$. I assume the symmetric matrix is defined by $h_{ij}=\langle e_n,\nabla_{e_i}e_j\rangle$. (Correct me if I am wrong.) Using 3 and 4, I get $h_{ij}=\omega_{j,n+1}(e_i)$. To arrive at the equation in the paper, I will have to justify (note that $\omega_j=\omega^j$) $$\Sigma_j \omega_{j,n+1}(e_i)\omega_j = \omega_{i,n+1}.$$ I am stuck at this step.

1343915,Joint Distribution Implies Independence...?,"Consider the measurable space $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$ and a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$.  Define a finite sequence of random variables $X_1,\ldots,X_n: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$.  Each $X_i$ induces a probability distribution measure on $\mathcal{B}$ given by $\mu_i(B_i) = P(X_i^{-1}(B_i))$ for $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$.  This part is clear to me. Now place these random variables into a vector, $X = (X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ and consider the target space $(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathcal{B} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathcal{B})$. Here's one part I'm not sure about.  We now have $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n$, and I guess since each $X_i$ is $\mathcal{F}$-measurable we get that $X$ is somehow $\mathcal{F}$-measurable and so we may define a ""joint"" probability distribution measure on $\mathcal{B} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathcal{B}$ given by $\mu(B) = P(X^{-1}(B))$ for $B = B_1 \times \ldots \times B_n \in \mathcal{B} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathcal{B}$. However, as I understand, a measure on a product space is called a product measure and is defined such that $\mu(B) = \mu_1(B_1)\cdots \mu_n(B_n)$.  But then $P(X^{-1}(B)) = P(X_1^{-1}(B_1))\cdots P(X_n^{-1}(B_n))$ and so the random variables are independent automatically. I've clearly misunderstood and/or overlooked something, so I would appreciate my errors being pointed out!","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"
1343950,A few questions on the later chapters in Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin (3rd Edition),"I am currently reading Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin (3rd Edition). I am enjoying the book and it's terseness, which isn't an issue for me. What I do have a problem with is that I hear the later chapters (chapters 9-11 specifically) aren't very good. I have a couple of questions. 1)What precisely makes these chapters subpar? Is it still worth reading, but adding in some supplements? 2)I plan on reading Real and Complex Analysis by Walter Rudin after this book, does it fill in the supposed missing quality of the last few chapters? Like, I know Lebesgue Theory and the Lebesgue Integral are important and that apparently isn't treated nicely in Principles of Mathematical Analysis (it would be nice if you could tell me exactly why this is so) either, but is it developed better in Real and Complex Analysis ?

1343983,Prove that $Df(p)=f(p)T$ where $T(q)=\int_{0}^1q$,"Let $E=\mathcal{C}[0,1]$ provide with $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ norm. Let $f:E\to \mathbb{R}$, given by $f(p)=e^{\int_0^1 p}$.  I need to prove that $f$ is differentiable. My approach: Let $p,q\in\mathcal{C}[0,1]$ then,
$$f(p+tq)-f(p)=e^{\int_0^1 p+tq}-e^{\int_0^1 p}=e^{\int_0^1 p}\left( e^{t\int_{0}^1 q}-1\right)=f(p)\left(1+t\int_{0}^1q+t\ o(1)-1 \right)$$
The last equality is true, just applying Taylor's Formula. Then we have $$\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{f(p+tq)-f(p)}{t}= f'_{q}(p)=f(p)\int_{0}^1 q$$
So I deduce that if $f$ is differentiable, then $Df(p)=f(p)T$, where $T(q)=\int_{0}^1q$. The operator $f(p)T$ is linear because $T$ is linear, and is continuous because: $\left|f(p)\int_{0}^1 q \right|\leq f(p)\|q\|_{\infty}$, from this I know that $\left(\int_{0}^1q\right)^2\leq \|q\|_{\infty}^2$. Maybe my question is silly, but how can I prove that:
$$f(p+q)-f(p)=f(p)T(q)+\|q\|_{\infty}\ o(1)$$ I tried for longer but finally I'm stuck! Thanks in advance.",['analysis']
1343988,"Using the complex logarithm as a conformal mapping,","I want to map the upper half plane, y>0, conformally onto the semi-infinite strip u>0, $-\pi < v < \pi$ in the w-plane. I then studied the complex logarithm, and noticed that the principal branch, Log(z), maps every point z in $C - R^- \bigcup {0}$ to w = ln|z| + iArg(z), where Arg(z) ranges from $-\pi$ to $\pi$. So, the images of the whole plane, minus the negative real axis (and 0), have positive real part and imaginary part between $-\pi$ to $\pi$. Is my work done?  Can I conclude that the mapping from the UHP to the semi-infinite strip is just $$w = Log(z)?$$ Something seems a little off, since all of C (minus the negative real axis) maps to the horizontal strip.

The product topology on $X=\prod_{\alpha\in A}X_{\alpha}$ is the weak topology generated by the coordinate maps $\pi^{}_{\alpha}:X\to X_\alpha$. The following is an exercise about open sets in $X$ endowed with the product topology： If $A$ is infinite, a product of nonempty open sets $\prod_{\alpha\in A}U_{\alpha}$ (where $U_\alpha$ is open in $X_\alpha$) is open in $X$ iff $U_\alpha=X_\alpha$ for all but finitely many $\alpha$.

$$\ln(1-x) = -(x + x^2/2 + x^3/3 +...)$$ So seem like I can't find a function $f(x)$ such that $\ln(1-x) +f(x) > 0$. Can anyone give me some hint to solve this? For the second problem, I got no idea.

1344069,Counting points on the Klein quartic,"In Moreno's book ""Algebraic Curves over Finite Fields"", he mentions the following in passing with no further comments ($K$ denotes the Klein quartic defined by $X^3 Y + Y^3 Z + Z^3 X = 0$): The Jacobian of $K$ is a product of three elliptic curves all isogenous to the elliptic curve with complex multiplication over the field $Q(\sqrt{-7})$. This last fact implies the existence of a formula for counting the number of rational points on $K$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ which depends on how the prime $p$ splits in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-7}]$. Does anyone know what he is referring to? The Klein quartic is the same as the modular curve $X(7)$ which has genus 3, so I'd be very interested in such a formula! EDIT: After some computation, it appears that the number of points on $X(7)$ over $\mathbf{F}_q$ is precisely $q+1$ as long as $q \not\equiv 1 \bmod 7$ (*). Otherwise, the behaviour of the error term $a_q = q+1-\#X(7)(\mathbf{F}_q)$ is kind of complicated, but it appears to be constant if we restrict attention to primes $q$ lying in certain quadratic progressions, for example when $q$ is of the form $28n^2 - 28n + 43$ my data suggests that we always have $a_q = -12$. Does anyone have any idea what's going on here? Note that when $q \equiv 1 \bmod 7$ then $a_q/3 = b_q$ where $b_n$ are the Fourier coefficients of the unique cusp form of weight 2 for the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_0(49)$. Furthermore, what would the moduli interpretation be of statement (*) above? We know $X(7)$ has 24 cusps, but the only time there are elliptic curves defined over $\mathbf{F}_q$ with complete rational 7-torsion is when $q \equiv 1 \bmod 7$ and the trace of Frobenius is 2 mod 7... so why should there be precisely $q-23$ noncuspidal points on $X(7)$ when $q \not\equiv 1 \bmod 7$?","['modular-forms', 'moduli-space', 'algebraic-geometry', 'quartics', 'finite-fields']"

1344097,Uniform Sampling on Intersection of Simplices,"I'm trying to sample uniformly on the intersections of faces of several simplicies, with all coordinates being non-negative. That is, given constraints
$$A\vec{w}=\vec{b} \ \ and \ \ \vec{w} \geq \vec{0} \ \ and \ \ \sum w_i = 1,$$
I want to sample $\vec{w}$ uniformly. $A$'s dimension is about $100 \times 10000$. A concrete example will be: 
$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & 1 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 & 2

b=\begin{bmatrix}

I am well aware that rejection-sampling and MCMC sampling can theoretically solve this problem. However, I have already implemented both approaches in programming, and neither of these two methods performs well enough. This is because the dimension of my sampling space usually goes up to 10000, and rejection sampling simply throws away too many points and MCMC is taking forever to converge. Therefore, I'm desperate to try new methods. Many thanks in advance!!

I am aware of the fact there is a closed-form formula for the classical one-dimensional OU process, but in the case of two interacting processes as above I don't believe this is possible. As a result, my first idea was to naively apply the Euler-Maruyama scheme, as follows: $$X_{t_{k+1}}^1=X_{t_k}^1+(X_{t_k}^2-X_{t_k}^1)h+\sigma_1(W_{t_{k+1}}^1-W_{t_k}^1)$$ $$X_{t_{k+1}}^2=X_{t_k}^2+(X_{t_k}^1-X_{t_k}^2)h+\sigma_2(W_{t_{k+1}}^2-W_{t_k}^2)$$ with $X_{t_0}^1=x_1$, $X_{t_0}^2=x_2$, $t_k=\frac{kT}{N}$, N being the number of subdivisions, and $h=\frac{T}{N}$. However, I am not sure whether the Euler-Maruyama scheme can be applied to this interacting case, and whether or not the scheme would effectively converge in this specific context.

1344117,Lines in the plane from Concrete Mathematics. How many bounded regions are there?,"I'm studying Concrete Mathematics by Donald Knuth. While doing the warmup questions, from the recurrence chapter, I stumbled upon an interesting problem. I have an intuition about the solution but I don't know how to express it. If you can give me any pointers I would greatly appreciate it. The problem that I'm interested in is based on this original problem: What is the maximum number $L(n)$ of regions defined by $n$ lines in the plane. The book goes to explain the recurrence $L(n) = L(n-1) + n$. We identify this pattern from generating solutions for the first few smaller scenarios $L(0) = 1$ $L(1) = 2$ $L(2) = 4$ $L(3) = 7$ and so on... The book then identifies the ""closed form"" $L(n) = n(n + 1)/2 + 1$ And now the problem I'm trying to solve: Some of the regions defined by $n$ lines in the plane are infinite, while others are bounded. What's the maximum possible number of bounded regions? Knuth stresses the importance of looking at smaller scenarios when we try to first understand a problem. In doing so I realized that when $n$ is $0, 1$ or $2$` we don't have any bounded areas. Once we get to $n = 3$` we get one bounded area. This would be our base case. If we go further we notice that the maximum bounded areas for $n = 4$ are $2$, $n = 3$ are $4$, $n = 5$ are $7$. It seems like the initial recurrence is happening again but for bounded areas it starts with $n = 3$ instead of $n = 0$. So the new recurrence would look like this for bounded areas: $L(n) = L(n - 3) + n - 3$. Am I reasoning correctly about this problem and is there a better way to look at it? Can anybody offer suggestions on how to express this rational better if it is correct or if it's not correct why that's the case?","['recurrence-relations', 'induction', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1344132,Constructing Polynomial Function from Set of Points and Slopes,"I only have a basic knowledge of calculus but I would like to know if it's possible to, given a set of points each with their own slopes, construct the simplest (or any) polynomial function that perfectly fits the given information. In other words, a polynomial $P(x)$ would need to take on the value of each given ordinate at each given abscissa, and it's derivative, $P'(x)$ would need to take on the value of each given slope and each given abscissa. I'm thinking that it might not be possible because if there's a series of points  that lie on a straight line among many other, randomly distributed ones, the derivative $P'(x)$ would have a segment of constant value in the middle of the chaotic curvature surrounding it. I don't think that polynomial functions can have this kind of behavior, can they?

EDIT: I think once we rewrite all as $$ \frac{1}{2}\int_0^1 \left(\frac{\log ^2\left(\frac{t+2}{t}\right)}{t+1}-\frac{\log ^2(t+2)}{t+1}-\frac{\log ^2\left(\frac{1}{t}\right)}{t+1}\right) \, dt$$
and employ the proper variable change, we're almost done, the idea that just crossed my mind. The hardest part is probably the integral 
$$\int_0^1 \frac{\log ^2\left(\frac{t+2}{t}\right)}{t+1} \ dt$$ where 
by letting $t/(t+2)\mapsto t$, we obtain the far nicer form $$2\int_0^{1/3} \frac{\log ^2(t)}{1-t^2} \, dt$$
$$=\int_0^{1/3} \frac{\log ^2(t)}{ 1-t} \ dt+\int_0^{1/3}\frac{\log ^2(t)}{ 1+t} \, dt$$
where then using geometric series and swapping the integration and summation, we obtain that$$\int_0^1 \frac{\log ^2\left(\frac{t+2}{t}\right)}{t+1} \ dt=$$
$$2\text{Li}_3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)-2\text{Li}_3\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)+ \log (3) \left(4 \text{Li}_2\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)-\text{Li}_2\left(\frac{1}{9}\right)+\log (2) \log (3)\right) \tag1$$
Using geometric series again, we easily get that $$\int_0^1 \frac{\log ^2\left(\frac{1}{t}\right)}{t+1} \, dt=\frac{3}{2} \zeta (3) \tag2$$
The last integral can be reduced by variable change to a well-known integral treated by Leonard Lewin in his book about polylogarithms, that is $$\int_0^1 \frac{\log ^2(t+2)}{t+1} \, dt=\int_1^2 \frac{\log ^2(t+1)}{t} \, dt$$
So, we can use the fact that 
$$\int_0^t \frac{\log ^2(1+t)}{t} \, dt$$
$$=\log(t)\log^2(1+t)-2/3\log^3(1+t)-2\log(1+t)\operatorname{Li}_2\left(\frac{1}{1+t}\right)-2\operatorname{Li}_3\left(\frac{1}{1+t}\right)+2\zeta(3)$$ So, using the foregoing result, we immediately get that 
$$\int_1^2 \frac{\log ^2(t+1)}{t} \, dt$$
$$=-2 \text{Li}_3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)-2 \text{Li}_2\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \log (3)+\frac{7 \zeta (3)}{4}-\frac{1}{3} 2 \log ^3(3)+\log (2) \log ^2(3) \tag3$$ Combining $(1) (2) (3)$, we obtain that
$$\int_0^1 \frac{\log \left(\frac{1}{t}\right) \log (t+2)}{t+1} \, dt$$
$$=2 \text{Li}_3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)-\text{Li}_3\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)-\frac{1}{2} \left(\text{Li}_2\left(\frac{1}{9}\right)-6 \text{Li}_2\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\right) \log (3)-\frac{13 \zeta (3)}{8}+\frac{\log ^3(3)}{3}$$ Using $(20)$ from here http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dilogarithm.html and then the identity and $(1)$ from this question/answer Proving $\text{Li}_3\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)-2 \text{Li}_3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)= -\frac{\log^33}{6}+\frac{\pi^2}{6}\log 3-\frac{13\zeta(3)}{6}$? , we get that $$\int_0^1 \frac{\log \left(\frac{1}{t}\right) \log (t+2)}{t+1} \, dt=\frac{13}{24} \zeta (3).$$ A SPECIAL ADDENDUM: The present integral can be viewed as the key core of calculating a pretty tough integral that was posted on MSE some time go, 
$$\int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2 \left(-\frac{1}{1-z}\right)-\text{Li}_2 \left(-\frac{1}{1+z}\right)}{z}dz$$ at this link Evaluating $\int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2 \left(-\frac{1}{1-z}\right)-\text{Li}_2 \left(-\frac{1}{1+z}\right)}{z}dz$ . Simple integration by parts combined with the use of the geometric series shows that $$\int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2 \left(-\frac{1}{1-z}\right)-\text{Li}_2 \left(-\frac{1}{1+z}\right)}{z}dz$$ 
$$=\int_0^1 \frac{\log (z+2) \log (z)}{z+1}dz+\underbrace{\int_0^1\frac{\log (2-z) \log (z)}{1-z} \ dz}_{\large \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n H_n}{n^2}=-5/8  \zeta (3)}-\underbrace{\int_0^1\frac{\log (1-z) \log (z)}{1-z}dz}_{\large\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{H_n}{(n+1)^2}=\zeta (3)}-\underbrace{\int_0^1\frac{\log (z+1) \log (z)}{z+1} \, dz}_{\large \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^n H_n}{(n+1)^2}=-1/8\zeta (3)}$$

$$\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, \ldots \} \;$$
So, $18$ is excluded because $(2,6,18)=(2,2 {\cdot} 3, 2 {\cdot} 3^2)$ forms a geometric progression. He showed that the asymptotic density of that greedy sequence exceeds $0.71$. I wondered about sequences that avoid 3-term power progressions ,
$(a, a c, a c^k)$, where $c\ge 2$ and $k\ge 2$ are natural numbers.
Here I start again with $(1,2)$ and continue to add the first number that
avoids all 3-term power progressions:
$$\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 
30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, \ldots \}\;.$$
For example, $8$ is excluded because $(1,2,8)=(1,1{\cdot} 2, 1 {\cdot} 2^3)$
is a power sequence.
Much later, $945$ is excluded because $(35,105,945)=(35, 35{\cdot} 3, 35 {\cdot} 3^3)$. Q . What is the asymptotic density of the above greedy sequence
  that avoids all 3-term power progressions? The density appears to be about $0.63$, up to $644$ terms ending in $1021$.
Note that the square-free integers have density $6/\pi^2 \approx 0.61$.
My sequence is square-free, cube-free, etc., because $(1, c, c^k)$ is a 
power progression. 1 R. Rankin. ""Sets of integers containing not more than a given number of terms in arithmetical progression."" Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A . 65 (1961).

1344699,Can any function of the second moment of a random variable be recovered from its quantile function?,"Summary of question It is known that the expected value of a random variable can be obtained from integrating its survival function. This is easily restated in terms of the quantile function as:
$$
\int_0^\infty S(x)\;dx = \int_0^1F^{-1}(x)
$$ whose equivalence can be seen graphically as integrating over the same area. This is useful, as when dealing with empirical or stochastically generated CDFs, layer loss statistics can be estimated directly off of the empirical quantile/CDF. It would be useful to be able to extract layer loss variance information in a similar way. Is there any similar relationship or method to extract higher moments, limited or unlimited, from the quantile function? Detailed question Background It is a known property that given a random variable $X$ with density $f(x)$, cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F(x)$, survival function $S(x)$, and quantile function $F^{-1}(x)$, there is the following relationship between S(x) and E(X):
$$
E(X) = \int_0^\infty xf(x)\;dx = \int_0^\infty S(x)\;dx = \int_0^1F^{-1}(x)\;dx
$$ The last form, obtained by solving for the area in terms of y instead of x, is particurlarly convenient when forced to estimate these calculations in tabular formal (like Excel). Somewhat less known is that what we call the ""layer loss cost"" or the amount of the random variable that pierces a threshold but is capped by a limit is also recoverable from the survival function. Let $E(X\wedge A)$ be defined as the limited expected value of $X$ capped at $A$, or:
$$
E(X\wedge A) = \int_0^A xf(x)\;dx + A\int_A^\infty f(x)\;dx
$$
Given random variable $Y$, the loss in the layer between $A$ and $B$, defined as $\min(B-A, \max(0, X - A))$, or equvalently $\textrm{median}(0, B-A, X-A)$, the following relationship also holds:
$$
\begin{align}
E(Y) &= E(X\wedge B) - E(X\wedge A)\\
&= \int_A^B (x - A)f(x)\;dx + (B-A) \int_B^\infty f(x)\;dx\\
&= \int_A^B S(x)\;dx
\end{align}
$$ So it can be said that the CDF/survival function encodes information about the first moment (limited and unlimited) which can be relatively easy to extract. Proof for first moment Both relationships are usually proved by integration by parts, and can be proved generally without recourse to the specific form of the distribution at hand.
$$
\begin{align}
E(Y) &= \int_A^B (x - A)f(x)\;dx + (B-A) \int_B^\infty f(x)\;dx\\
&= \int_A^Bxf(x)\;dx - A \int_A^Bf(x)\;dx + (B - A)S(B)\\
&= \int_A^Bxf(x)\;dx - A\left[S(A) - S(B)\right] + BS(B) - AS(B)\\
&= \int_A^Bxf(x)\;dx - AS(A) + AS(B) + BS(B) - AS(B)
\end{align}
$$
Now to focus on the first term. Using the fact that $S(x) = 1 - F(x)$ we have
$$
\frac{d}{dx}S(x) = -f(x)
$$ So using integration by parts, we can let $u = x, du = 1, dv = f(x), v = -S(x)$ and state generally that:
$$
\begin{align}
\int_A^B xf(x)\;dx &= -xS(x)\bigg\vert_A^B + \int_A^B S(x) dx\\
&= \int_A^B S(x)\;dx - BS(B) + AS(A)
\end{align}
$$
Substituting the above in the original question we get
$$
\begin{align}
E(Y) = \int_A^B S(x)\;dx &- BS(B) + AS(A) \\
&- AS(A) + AS(B) + BS(B) - AS(B)
\end{align}
$$
All the non-integral terms cancel, leaving us with $E(Y) = \int_A^B S(x)\;dx\;\blacksquare$. Attempt for second moment I am interested in the variance of the random variable $Y$ as defined above. The most starightforward way to approach this would be to calculate $E(Y^2)$ and the subtract $E(Y)^2$ as obtained from the quantile function per above. This could be stated as:
$$
E(Y^2) = \int_A^B (x - A)^2 f(x)\;dx + (B-A)^2\int_B^\infty f(x)\;dx
$$
Expanding the terms, engaging in some algebraic manipulation and cancellation, and using the result from above for the first moment, we get (if I have not made a mistake):
$$
\int_A^B x^2 f(x)\;dx - 2A\overbrace{\int_A^BS(x)\;dx}^{\textrm{Can use } F^{-1}(x)} - A^2S(A) + B^2S(B)
$$ At this point I am stuck, since to use integration by parts to handle the first term would require knowing the antiderivative of the general survival function, which I don't know, nor do I know how to convert that into using the quantile function, as could be done for the survival function itself. Specific problem Using the same integration by parts technique on $\int_A^B x^2 f(x)\;dx$, the term
$$
\int_A^B x S(x)\;dx
$$ arises, and I do not know how to proceed from there. Recap As mentioned in the summary, often I will have an ground-up (0 to infinity) empirical distribution function for a random variable representing a loss severity, and I am interested not only in the expected loss in a layer but the variance of said loss, so being able to extract the second moment from the ECDF/quantile table would be very helpful. Thank you. Updated with Answer For completeness sake, for unlimited moments, just as:
$$
E(X) = \int_0^\infty S(x)\;dx
$$
the corresponding formula for the second moment is:
$$
E(X^2) = 2\int_0^\infty xS(x)\;dx
$$
And for layer values $Y$ as defined above, just as
$$
E(Y) = \int_A^B S(x)\;dx
$$
the second moment of $Y$ can be recovered as:
$$
E(Y^2) = 2\int_A^B (x-A)S(x)\;dx
$$ Updated with more complete and elegant answer to the general (non-layered) case See this question for a closed form answer for getting the moments of a distribution through integrating its quantile function, as well as the solution to $\int_0^\infty xS(x)dx$.","['actuarial-science', 'probability', 'statistics']"

1344743,What to call & how to compute errors in a very asymmetric sample,"Consider the following sample $\{1.25,1.5,1.75,2.0,2.25,2.5,2.75,10.\}$. Mean is $\mu=3.$, standard deviation is $\sigma\approx 2.69$. I am wondering how to compute and what to call error bars in the context of this sample. Using the standard error ($\mu \pm \sigma$) will obviously not be very useful as it would comprise the complete sample except for one outlier. Using 1st and 4th quartile $[1.75,2.5]$ describes the sample much better but seems odd to use for plotting error bars as well as the mean is not inside this interval. One could use the mean deviation of all upper (above the mean) and all lower (below the mean) observations, which would give $[2.,10.]$, but there does not seem to be a proper name for this concept (discussed here ). I tend to favor this option but have trouble referring to what is plotted in a convenient way (calling it ""mean deviation"", ""standard deviation"", ""standard errors"", or ""mean errors"" is just plain wrong; calling it ""errors"" or ""upper/lower errors"" seems unspecific and also seems to imply some kind of estimation which is not involved; calling it ""upper/lower deviation"" is unspecific and readers would likely assume it to refer to something like the standard deviation).

1344991,The position of a ladder leaning against a wall and touching a box under it,"I was reading a newspaper and there was a little math riddle, I thought ""how funny, that's gonna be easy, let's do it"" and here am I... The problem goes as follow :
in a barn, there is a 1 meter cubic box against a wall and a 4 meter ladder is leaning against the wall, touching the box at its corner. Here is a picture : So, the big triangle has a hypotenuse $FE$ of $4$, the square $ABDC$ has sides of length 1 and is basically ""insquared"" at the right angle, i.e. $D\in \overline{FE}$.
The question is ""what is the length of the biggest cathetus"", here $AF$. So far, no problem. Now here are my solutions: By Thales' intercept theorem, $\frac{FB}{FA}=\frac{BD}{AE}$, by hypothesis, $FB=FA-1$ and $BD=1$. Now by Pythagoras, $FA^2+AE^2=FE^2$; by hypothesis, $FE=4$, so we end up with a system of equations, letting $h=FA, d=AE$: $$ \begin{align} &\frac{h-1}{h}=\frac{1}{d} \\ &h^2+d^2=4^2  \end{align} $$
Which solves (removing 3 non-relevant solutions) into $d \cong 1.3622$ and $h \cong 3.76091$. Now, if I consider the ""function"" of the line : $f(x)=\frac{-h}{d}x+h$, I know that $f(1)=1$ and I end up with Pythagoras with the system :$$ \begin{align} &\frac{-h}{d}+h=1 \\ &h^2+d^2=4^2  \end{align} $$
it solves again into the same, again removing 3 non-relevant solutions Okay, this means that using Pythagoras is no good since it ends up giving a quartic equation (4 answers of which 3 are ""non-relevant""). Now if I consider the length of the arc $f(x)$ between $0$ and $d$ it has to be $4$ and again $f(1)=1$ I end up with the system:
$$ \begin{align} &\frac{-h}{d}+h=1 \\ &\int_0^d \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2} dx =\int_0^d \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{-h}{d}\right)^2} dx = d \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{-h}{d}\right)^2}   \end{align} $$
Which solves again into the same answers, but this time removing only 2 non-relevant solutions (i.e. it gives a cubic equation instead of a quartic).

EDIT: Apologies, I meant to say that p is uniformly distributed on [.4, .6], though I'm now curious how we would solve if we knew that p is normally distributed on [.4, .6].",['probability']
1345035,Showing that infinite product of random variables goes to zero: $\prod^\infty X_i \rightarrow 0 \text{ a.s.}$,"I am doing the following exercise: Let $X$ be a strictly positive rv with $\mathbb E[X]=1$ but $X \neq 1$ almost surely. Let $X_1, X_2 \dots$ be iid with same distribution as $X$. Now let $M_0=1$ and 
$$M_n = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} X_k$$
The task is to show that $M_n \rightarrow 0$ almost surely. Some sub-problems preceding showing this convergence was to show that $\mathbb E[\ln(X)]<0$ and that $\mathbb E[M_n]=1$. That is straightforward. Then one is asked to show the said convergence by considering 
$$
M_n = e^{\sum^n \ln X_k}
$$
So I have tried to reason that in order for $e^{\sum^n \ln X_k} \rightarrow 0$ almost surely, we need $\sum^n \ln X_k \rightarrow -\infty$ almost surely. Here I have some doubts as to how to proceed. I have tried to think in terms of Borel-Cantelli and show this by making an argument along the lines of: for any $N \in (-\infty, 0]$ 
$$
\mathbb P(M_n < N \text{ eventually}) = 1
$$
etc but it seems that this ends up requiring me to know things about the distribution of $M_n$ which I know nothing about (except its mean). Any help highly appreciated.","['probability', 'random-variables']"
1345042,"Can a square be in the form $2x + 1$, when $x$ is odd?","I was given this question, and I think I have solved it, but I'm not sure it is correct because this differs from how the answer is given. What is the most common way to solve this problem? Let's suppose there was a square that could be written as $$2x + 1$$ x being odd. Then: $$2x + 1 = S^2$$ and $$2x = (S + 1)(S - 1)$$ and $$x = \left(\frac{S + 1}{2}\right)(S-1)$$ Now, if $x$ is odd, then $S$ must be odd too. So $S + 1$ is even, therefore $$x = N(S - 1)$$ [with] $N$ being a natural number. And since $S - 1$ is also even, we have $$x = NE.$$ A contradiction, as any number multiplied by even must be even, and $x$ is supposed to be odd.","['number-theory', 'proof-verification', 'square-numbers']"

1345078,Convergence of $\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(1-\frac{z^2}{n^2}\right)$,"I'm looking at some notes from my previous complex variables course and I need help verifying some things about the convergence of $$
\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(1-\frac{z^2}{n^2}\right)
$$ on compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ . My professor shows its convergence by using the property of infinite products which states that $\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-a_n)$ converges if and only if $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\log(1-a_n)$ converges, given $a_n\neq 1$ for each $n$ . I have a few issues I would like to work out with this: $\mathbf{\frac{z^2}{n^2}=1}$ when $\mathbf{z=\pm n}$ , which one would think makes the property inapplicable . I believe I have maneuvered around this hurdle because if $z$ belongs to an arbitrary compact subset of $\mathbb{C}$ , then $\frac{z^2}{n^2}=1$ for only finitely many $n$ , there exists an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{z^2}{n^2}\neq 1$ for all $n\geq
N$ , and it suffices to check convergence of $\sum_{n=N}^{\infty}\log\left(1-\frac{z^2}{n^2}\right)$ . The
only thing that concerns me is that this point wasn't mentioned in
the notes whatsoever. Convergence $\mathbf{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\log\left(1-\frac{z^2}{n^2}\right)}$ is shown by noticing $\mathbf{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|\frac{z^2}{n^2}\right|}$ converges uniformly on compact subsets of $\mathbf{\mathbb{C}}$ (through the Weierstrass M-test, for example). I've thought this through but I don't see it at all. I was thinking
it might be because $\log\left(1-\frac{z^2}{n^2}\right)$ ,
could be thought of as a function of $\frac{z^2}{n^2}$ , but this
cannot hold always since $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n^2}}$ is a function of $\frac{1}{n^2}$ but the sum of these terms clearly does not
converge. Any help on these points is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.","['compactness', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence', 'complex-analysis', 'infinite-product']"

I tried to prove it for small $n$. For example, for $n=5$ I came up with the following heuristic argument: 3 or 4 or 5 of them are all odd or all even, so we need to exclude the ''5''-case. Assuming they all are, for example, even, we compare them modulo 4, and get the same alternative, and so on.

1345125,Markov Chains - Strong Markov Property,"I'm struck with an exercise. I tried, but the results don't seem to fit to those proposed. Exercise: Two players play the following game. The one who begins draws two cards from a deck of 40 cards (10 cards per suit): if they are both clubs the player wins; if they are of the same suit but not clubs, the player shuffles the cards and start again; else the player shuffles the cards and let the other player play. 1) Model the game with a Markov Chain. 2) What is the probability that who started wins? My attempt :
If $X_n$ is the player in the current turn, we have a three state MC whose state space is $\{A,\, B,\, \text{exit}\}$. The exit state is the one reached when the game ends.
The transition matrix is $$P=\begin{pmatrix}9/52 & 10/13 & 3/52 \\ 10/13 & 9/52 & 3/52 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$ since the probability of staying is $\frac{3 \cdot 9}{4 \cdot 39}$ and so on. For the second question I thought I could use the Strong Markov Property (the one which states that a Markov Chain can start afresh in a Stopping Time) by using the last time I see A (or B) before the game ends. Starting from that point, the probability is just the jump from A (or B) to exit times two (to consider both the A and the B case).

We were exposed to things like the Dirac delta (without mention of distributions ), Fourier series (without mention of convergence or function spaces ), the Laplace and Fourier transforms, and the sampling theorem. I still don't truly understand the sifting property, or why sampling is multiplication with a shifted delta instead of a shifted 1 (which would preserve the value of the signal at that point right?). I'm still not sure how to determine when a signal's Fourier series will converge, when you are allowed to take a Fourier or Laplace transform, or whether the derivations of the transform properties we learned are mathematically justified and rigorous. This led me to self study books like Tolstov's Fourier Series and Richards's Theory of Distributions , which I could not follow due to my non-rigorous math background. The Osgood Stanford lectures were quite helpful, but I still feel quite sad that I do not have a deeper understanding of my math tools.

But since $1$ and $-1$ are symmetric points w.r.t. the imaginary axis, the Mobius transformations always maps symmetric points to symmetric points.  So, the images, $0$ and $\infty$, being symmetric points, must mean that they are symmetric with respect to a circle.  So the real axis gets mapped to some circle centered at the origin. How do I tell how big this circle is?  And since the real axis separates the upper and lower half planes, either the upper or lower plane gets mapped inside the circle, but how can I tell? I tried a sample point:  I see that $i$ gets mapped to $i$, but is this telling me that the mapping is ""fixing"" the UHP?  I doubt it, because it's mapping stuff to some open disk.

My solution started with that there are $4!$ ways of distributing the aces initially, and then subsequently there are $48 \choose 12$ ways of distributing the rest of the first hand, $36 \choose 12$ ways of distributing the rest of the second hand, and $24 \choose 12$ ways of distributing the third hand, and one way to distribute the last hand. Thus there are $4! *$ $48 \choose 12$ $*$ $36 \choose 12$ $*$ $24 \choose 12$ ways of the players having exactly one ace. The total sample space, however, is counted for by first giving the first player his hand ($52 \choose 13$), the second player has hand from the remaining deck, ($39 \choose 13$), etc.; so the sample space is $ 52\choose 13$ $*$ $39 \choose 13$ $*$ $26 \choose 13$.
