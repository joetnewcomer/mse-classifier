1527383,Inverse Trigonometric functions question,"I have problem - I have a solution also, though. But still a confusion. I have to evaluate the expression : $arctan \sqrt{\dfrac{x(x+y+z)}{yz}} + arctan \sqrt{\dfrac{y(x+y+z)}{xz}} + arctan \sqrt{\dfrac{z(x+y+z)}{xy}}$ Now, I observed that $\sqrt{\dfrac{x(x+y+z)}{yz}}(=A)+ \sqrt{\dfrac{y(x+y+z)}{xz}}(=B) + \sqrt{\dfrac{z(x+y+z)}{xy}}(=C) = ABC.$ Hence, $A+B+C=ABC.$ Now,When this happens, $\arctan x + \arctan y + \arctan z= 0$ or $\pi$. Now, My question is, what is the answer of my question, $0$ or $\pi$ ?

1527398,What is the exact statement of Menelaus' Theorem?,"Can someone give me the exact statement of the Menelaus' theorem?

1527407,"$e^{-x^{\alpha}}$ is Lebesgue-integrable on $[0,\infty)$ for $\alpha>0$","Prove that for $\alpha>0$, the function $e^{-x^{\alpha}}$ is $\mu$-integrable on $[0,\infty)$, where $\mu$ is the one-dimensional Lesbesgue measure. Obviously we want to make an upper bound for the function on this interval and use the dominated convergence theorem, I tried the following: $e^{x^{\alpha}} \leq 1$ for $x\leq 1$ because we have $e^{−x^{\alpha}} \le \dots$. In my exercise class I saw that $x^{-2}$ is an integrable function on $(1,\infty)$, so if I can prove that: $e^{−x^{\alpha}} \leq Mx^{−2}$ for some suitable constant $M = M_\alpha < \infty$, I can easily use the dominated convergence theorem.

1527581,Determine the complex contour integral $\oint \limits_{C} \frac{2}{z^3+z}dz$ without using Residue Theorems,"Without residue theory, determine $$\oint \limits_{C} \frac{2}{z^3+z}dz$$ if $C: \big|~z~-~\frac{i}{2}~\big|=1$ is positively oriented. We first find that our integrand has three distinct singular points $z=\{-i,~0,~i\}$ Now if we draw a sketch of $C$ , we see that only two of these singular points are within $C$ . We can thus rewrite our integral as $$\oint \limits_{C} \frac{2}{z^3+z}dz = 2 \oint \limits_C \bigg(\frac{1}{z}\cdot \frac{1}{(z+i)(z-i)}\bigg)dz$$ Now we may define two closed, piecewise smooth curves $C_1, C_2$ around each singular point in $C$ as follows We then have that \begin{align}\oint \limits_{C} \frac{2}{z^3+z}dz &= 2 \oint \limits_C \bigg(\frac{1}{z}\cdot \frac{1}{(z+i)(z-i)}\bigg)dz \\ &= 2 \bigg[ \underbrace{\oint \limits_{C_1} \bigg(\frac{1}{z}\cdot \frac{1}{(z+i)(z-i)}\bigg)dz}_{\displaystyle I_1} + \underbrace{\oint \limits_{C_2} \bigg(\frac{1}{z}\cdot \frac{1}{(z+i)(z-i)}\bigg)dz}_{\displaystyle I_2} \bigg] \end{align} Now let $f(z) = \frac{1}{z(z+i)}$ then, from Cauchy Integral Formula, we know that \begin{align}I_1 &=\oint \limits_{C_1} \frac{f(z)}{(z-i)}dz \\ &= 2\pi i ~f(i) \\ &=-\pi i\end{align} Now let $g(z) = \frac{1}{(z+i)(z-i)}$ , then from Cauchy Integral Formula, we know that \begin{align}I_2 &= \oint \limits_{C_2} \frac{g(z)}{z}dz \\ &= 2\pi i ~ g(0) \\ &= 2\pi i\end{align} So finally we have that \begin{align}\oint \limits_C \frac{2}{z^3 + z}dz = 2\big( -\pi i + 2\pi i\big) = 2 \pi i\end{align} Does this seem correct?","['cauchy-integral-formula', 'contour-integration', 'complex-analysis']"

So far I've concluded that both are false because if $n = 8$ for the first one, then $\log^2 8 = O(8)$ which is false since it simplifies to $9 = O(8)$ which does not belong to $O(n)$. For the second one, I believe it to be false as well because if $n = 1024$ or (some other big number), you get $1024 = O(\log^2 1024)$ which simplifies to $1024 = O(100)$.

1527983,Bounding the global intersection of a family of sets,"Suppose that we have a decision tree of height $r + 1$ that describes how to increment an $n$-bit integer in the range $[0, 2^n -1]$. That is, the internal nodes are labelled with a bit position that you read, then depending on its value, you either go left or right and proceed to read the next bit indicated. The leaf nodes are labelled with a set of bits that are flipped to perform the increment operation. Note that the sequence of integers may not be the traditional Standard Binary Code, but could be any cyclic sequence of the $2^n$ integers. A Gray Code is another example of a sequence that may be produced (which corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle in the hypercube graph). Now, consider the root to ""right before"" leaf paths as sets of size $r$ from a universe of size $n$. I am trying to argue the following claim: Suppose that the root node of our decision tree is labelled by index $i$. If we take the paths on the left side of the tree (when $i$ is read as  $0$) such that bit $i$ is not flipped, together with the paths on the right side of the tree (when $i$ is read as $1$) such that bit $i$ is flipped, then I am interested in bounding the size of the common intersection of those sets. In particular, we know that every set will contain index $i$ since it sits at our root node, but I would like to show that these sets must also have another bit in common. I know that I do not want to use the sunflower lemma, as these sets may not have the same pairwise intersection, but I believe that I may be interested in something similar that characterizes the global intersection of all of these sets). Perhaps it may help to view the problem as a hypergraph, though I am not sure of results that may be of use. The other thing to note is that these are not arbitrary sets, as they are derived from a decision tree for increment integers, so there is a lot of structure involved. Any help would be greatly appreciated, whether it's some guidance on how to prove this, or perhaps references to potentially useful theorems.

1528137,Gradient versus Tangent,"I am in calculus 3 and I have a question on gradient versus tangent. I know that this has been answered several times before: Difference between a Gradient and Tangent But I still have much trouble understanding them. Assume $z = x^2 + y^2$ (a sphere) In the topic of directional derivatives and gradients , gradient is the steepest slope (or, more formally, the direction to move so that z increases most rapidly). AT THE SAME TIME , it is a normal to the level curve (to my understanding, it means when z is fixed at a particular value, a vector that is perpendicular to the tangent of a curve at a particular point. The gradient points to the concave side of the level curve). Combining the two ideas above, I assume it is correct that a normal to the level curve is the same as the direction in which z will increase most rapidly (although I am unsure why it is true). Somehow, then I thought that gradient points to the direction where a tangent line to the 3D object is, because gradient points to the direction of the steepest slope. And then in the following topic of tangent planes, now it tells me that gradient is actually a normal line instead of a tangent line to a 3D object? What a surprise! In the case of 2D, gradient is the slope of a line. therefore, I naturally think that in the case of 3D, gradient is also the slope (or, the vector that points to the steepest slope for z). It is not the case? What is wrong with my thinking?","['scalar-fields', 'multivariable-calculus']"

We can set up the integral in a couple of different ways; the most straightforward of which would be $$ \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{3/2}}\int\limits_{0}^\infty \int\limits_{-x_1}^\infty \int\limits_{-x_1 - x_2}^\infty e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2)} \, dx_3 \, dx_2 \, dx_1$$ which I am unsure how to integrate.  It looks like spherical coordinates might work, but I wasn't able to (correctly) write out the region in spherical coordinates.  We can also set up the integral in a different way: if we let $X = (X_1,X_2,X_3)^T$ and $S = (S_1,S_2,S_3)^T$, then we have $AX = S$ where $$A = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
 1 & 0 & 0  \\
 1 & 1 & 0 \\
 1 & 1 & 1
 \end{array} \right).$$ 
If we let $\mathbb{R}_+^3 = \{(x,y,z):x,y,z > 0\}$, then we have $$\mathbb{P}(S \in \mathbb{R}_+^3) = \mathbb{P}(AY \in \mathbb{R}_+^3) = \mathbb{P}(Y \in A^{-1}\mathbb{R}_+^3).$$
This last probability can be calculated from the following integral: $$\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \int\limits_{0}^\infty\int\limits_{0}^\infty\int\limits_{0}^\infty e^{-\frac{1}{2}\| (x_1,x_2 - x_1,x_3 - x_2)\|^2  } \, dx_1 \, dx_2 \, dx_3$$ but I don't see how this is better.  If my region were all of $\mathbb{R}^3$, then it would be easier, since I could just write $(A^{-1})^TA^{-1} = P^T D P$ and send $x \mapsto Px$ to change coordinates nicely.  The problem is that the $P$ that we get turns out to be quite ugly, and it's hard to say what the region looks like after this change of coordinates. It may be worth mentioning that the simulation I ran seems to suggest that this probability is $\frac{5}{16}$.  This is a homework problem, but I'm really stuck, and unsure if there's anything intelligent to do.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

The problem is to find the maximum area of a right triangle with a constant perimeter $P$. To start solving this problem I wrote down the different equations for the area and perimeter of a right triangle. $A=\frac{a*b}{2}$ for area and $P= a+b+h$ for the perimeter. I decided to first find a side length by substituting $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ for $h$  and then solving for $a$ in the perimeter equation.  Here are the steps I took… $$P=a+b+\sqrt {a^2+b^2}$$ $$(P-a-b)^2=(\sqrt{a^2+b^2})^2$$ $$P^2+2ab-2aP-2bP=0$$ $$2a(b-P)=2bP-P^2$$ $$a=(\frac{1}2)(\frac{2bP-P^2}{b-P})$$ Now that I have the equation for $a$, I’m uncertain about how to proceed. I know that I could also solve for side length $b$ and put the two side length equations in for $a$ and $b$ in the area equation and get ... $$A=\frac{(\frac{1}{2})(\frac{2aP-P^2}{a-P})(\frac{1}{2})(\frac{2bP-P^2}{b-P})}{2}$$ or I could just substitute b in the equation and get… $$A=\frac{a*(\frac{1}{2})(\frac{2bP-P^2}{b-P})}{2}$$ I also know that once I have an equation for area I need to find its derivative and set it equal to zero and then solve for $P$. What I’m unsure about is which area equation I need and how to find its derivative. My tutor told me that I need to use both the chain rule and product rule in order to find the derivative. I can use both the chain rule and the product rule separately but I’m not sure how to use both on either equation.","['calculus', 'derivatives']"

1529474,The distance from a point in $l_\infty$ to $c_0$,"$l_\infty$ is the space of bounded sequences and $c_0$ is the space of sequences converge to $0$, is a closed subspace of $l_\infty$. I am trying to prove that for any $x \in l_\infty$, $\;d(x,c_0) = \displaystyle \limsup_{n\to \infty} |x_n|$. Progress : I started with $d(x,c_0) = \inf_{y \in c_0} {d_\infty (x,y)} = \inf_{y \in c_0} \sup_{i \in N} |x_i - y_i|$, then I got stuck. Here we have $\limsup y_n = 0$, but I dont know how can I make use of that","['lp-spaces', 'banach-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
