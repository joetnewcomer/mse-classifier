465447,Reflecting points on a square to make it larger,"You are given four points (on a Euclidian plane) that make up the corners of a square.
You may change the positions of the points by a sequence of moves. Each move changes the position of one point, say p, to a new location, say p', by ""skipping over"" one of the other 3 points. More precisely, p skips over a point q if it is moved to the diametrically opposed side of q. In other words, a move from p to p' is allowed if there exists a point q such that $q = (p + p') / 2$. Find a sequence of moves that results in a larger square. Or, if no such sequence is possible, give a proof of why it isn't possible. (The new square need not be oriented the same way as the original square. For example, the larger square may be turned 45 degrees from the original, and the larger square may have the points in a different order from in the original square.) I've tried many different combinations and still haven't gotten anything more than 3 points in the right position and one point completely off. Is this possible?",['geometry']
465454,How to show this obvious and basic property of abelian groups?,"I have a question that is probably very silly, but let's go. Let $(G,+)$ be an abelian group. In that case we know that $+$ is associative and commutative. This leads us to the following: if $\{a_i \in G : i \in I_n\}$ with $I_n = \{i \in \mathbb{N} : 1 \leq i \leq n\}$, then if we apply $+$ to all of the $a_i$, it independs on the ordering we impose. In truth, if we want to define the sum of all of those elements as: $$\sum_{i \in I_n}a_i = a_1+\cdots+a_n,$$ we should first know what means $a_1 + \cdots + a_n$. The definition just tells us what means $x+y$ and that $x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z$ and $x+y=y+x$ for every $x,y,z \in G$, but how we formalize the extension of this into some finite number of elements in order to be able to say ""we can write it that way, because we proved that it makes sense""? Indeed this is something very obvious, and I've never seem someone giving great arguments about it. Everyone just says ""obviously, the parentheses and the order doesn't matter"". I've thought on using inductions on those two properties each at a time, but I've got a little confused with it. How is this really done? Is a proof necessary? Or we just leave it there without proof? Thanks very much in advance, and sorry if this is not the place for this kind of question.","['group-theory', 'abelian-groups']"

465492,Inverse Laplace Transform as Bromwich Integral,"I am seeking a references that provide a rigorous treatment of the inverse Laplace transform (Bromwich integrals), and how to compute them (beyond using tabled solutions - they don't cover my needs, so I'm trying to learn to do it via complex analysis)? Textbooks or papers would be great. I would prefer something with lots of examples worked out if possible, my experience with complex integration is a bit shallow. To clarify, I'd like to understand how to handle integrals like this: $$
\mathscr{L}^{-1}_s\lbrace F(s)\rbrace=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma-i\infty}^{\gamma+i\infty} e^{st}F(s) ds
$$ for a real number $$\gamma > Re(s)$$ for each singularity s of F. Should I just be looking at the calculus of residues, or is there something special about integrals of this sort? It appears a bit different than what I've seen in my complex analysis text - there I would always see integrals of this sort: $$ \int_L f(s)ds $$ But L would always be a closed rectifiable curve, while the inverse Laplace transform appears to be over a vertical line in the complex plane, which I'm not sure how to interpret. Perhaps it's just a notational misunderstanding, and I'm meant to construct a suitable contour expanding on that vertical line? Any direction would be greatly appreciated!","['laplace-transform', 'complex-analysis']"

465540,non sequential spaces,"I am looking for a space which is not sequential. I tried to build this example:
Take $X$ to be a countable union of the folloing points:
 $X= (\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty( \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty (\frac1n,\frac1k)))\cup(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty(0,\frac1i))\cup\{(0,0)\} $ ($n,k,i$ are natural numbrs). Define Basis neighborhoods of every point in $X$ to b: if a point is of the form $(\frac1n,\frac1k)$, Then an open basis neighborhood of $x$ will be (the intersection of) vertical open segments containing $(\frac1n,\frac1k)$ (with $X$). if a point is of the form $(\frac1n,0)$, Then an open basis neighborhood of $x$ will be (the intersection of) open discs containing $(\frac1n,0)$ (with $X$). an open basis neighborhood of $(0,0)$ is (the intersetion of) open disc containing $0$ in it's boundary union with $(0,0)$ itself (with $X$). This is how it looks like: I think that this is a topology and that $(X,T)$ is not sequential since take a subset $A$ of $X$ which is $A= (\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty( \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty (\frac1n,\frac1k)))$. Then $(0,0)$ is contained in $\overline{A}$ but there is no sequence in $A$ which is converges to $(0,0)$, (because if non of the points are on $X-axis$, I can always find an open neighborhood of $(0,0)$ not containing it)

465560,"To generalize of Fermat's Last Theorem, to find the solution of $a^n+b^n+c^n = d^n$","The Fermat's Last Theorem was proved by Andrew Wiles in 1995. It states that no three positive integers $x$, $y$, and $z$ can satisfy the equation  $x^n+y^n= z^n$ for any integer value of $n$ greater than two.

465565,Proof of Fourier Inverse formula for $L^1$ case,"I know this may be a stupid question, but still hope someone can help me. I was trying to prove the Fourier inversion formula for which $f$ and $\hat{f}=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x)e^{-i2\pi xy}dx$ both lie in $L^1$, and then $f=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\hat{f}(y)e^{i2\pi xy}dy$. I assume the knowing of FT of the Gaussian function $g_c(x)=e^{-c\pi x^2}$, which is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{c}}e^{-\frac{1}{c}\pi x^2}$. Then I have
$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}}\hat{f}(y)e^{i2\pi xy}dy=\lim_{c\to0}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\hat{f}(y)g_c(y)e^{i2\pi xy}dy\\
$$ Using the definition of $\hat{f}$ and Fubini, this becomes
$$
\lim_{c\to0}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(t)e^{-i2\pi ty}dtg_c(y)e^{i2\pi xy}dy=
\lim_{c\to0}\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(t)\hat{g}_c(t-x)dt
$$ Now I came to the problem. Formally one can guess that $\hat{g}_c(t)$ is just the Dirac function as $c\to0$ so that convolution gives $f$ itself, but how can one show that strictly, especially for an $L^1$ function? On the other hand, I also directly calculated $g_c(t-x)$ which gives me
$$
\lim_{c\to0}\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(t)\frac{1}{\sqrt{c}}e^{-\frac{1}{c}\pi(t-x)^2}dt. $$Change of variables gives me
$$
\lim_{c\to0}\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x-\sqrt{c}y)e^{-\pi y^2}dy

465603,Are there simple examples of Riemannian manifolds with zero curvature and nonzero torsion,"I am trying to grasp the Riemann curvature tensor, the torsion tensor and their relationship. In particular, I'm interested in necessary and sufficient conditions for local isometry with Euclidean space (I'm talking about isometry of an open set - not the tangent space - with Euclidean space) - and I'd especially like to grasp these tensors in terms of their measuring the failure of Euclid's parallel postulate in a particular manifold. In a Riemannian manifold $M$, we can choose the Levi-Civita connexion and null out the torsion. So then the curvature wholly determines whether or not we can find the Euclidean open set: we seek an open set wherein $R(X_p,Y_p)Z_p = 0; \forall X_p,Y_p, Z_p \in T_p M, \forall p \in U \subset M$ and we are done. Question 1. However, what happens to the curvature $R$ in the Riemannian case if we use other connexions with the same geodesic sprays but with different, nonzero torsions $T$? Question 2. Is there a formula showing how $R$ and $T$ in the case of connexions with the same geodesic sprays? Question 3. Can we still test the curvature alone as above to see whether there is a local Euclidean open set, or do we now need to make sure that torsion also vanishes in that open set too? Question 4. If we relax the Riemannian condition and talk abstractly about a connexion alone, which of the above answers change? and lastly: Question 5. I'd really like to have an example of a space with zero curvature but nonzero torsion over a whole, open set, not just at a point, if such a thing exists. I think this would help build intuition.","['riemannian-geometry', 'curvature', 'differential-geometry']"
465626,On minimizing matrix norm,"Given $m\geq n \geq k$ and $A \in M^{m\times n}(\mathbb{C})$, the problem asks to evaluate $$\inf_{\textrm{rank}(B)\leq k}||A-B||$$ and gives condition on $A$ making the above minimum is taken by some unique $B$. Here $||\cdot||$ denotes standard spectral norm of a matrix, i.e. the norm of a linear functional defined by regarding matrix as linear transform between Euclidean spaces with canonical Euclidean norm. It is quite clear if we apply Singular Value Decomposition to $A$, we will find
$$\inf_{\mathrm{rank}(B)\leq k}||A-B||\leq \sigma_{k+1}$$
where $\sigma_1\geq\sigma_2\geq\cdots\geq\sigma_n\geq0$ denotes the singular value of $A$, and define $\sigma_{n+1}=0$.

Where $H$ is a Hermitian matrix and the initial point $|\psi_0\rangle$ has magnitude 1, i.e $\langle \psi_0|\psi_0\rangle=1$. Geometrically, these curves are confined to the surface of the unit $n$-sphere. A subset of these curves are geodesics, i.e. they trace the great circles of the unit $n$-sphere. I would like to know the answers to the following two questions: Given a matrix $H$, how could one tell whether it represents a great circle when plugged in to the above equation? I.e. do the matrices corresponding to geodesics have some special properties in terms of their elements, eigenvalues, etc.? Is there an accepted term for such matrices? More importantly: given the coordinates of two points on the unit $n$-circle, how can I find a Hermitian matrix $H$ that corresponds the great circle that passes through both points? I want to do this numerically, but of course if there's an analytical solution that would be great. Note: my actual problem is regarding curves in a real vector space of the form $|\psi\rangle(t) = e^{At}|\psi_0\rangle$, where $A$ is antisymmetric.

For example, if about one point in a topological space there exists an open set not containing another (distinct) point, the two points are referred to as topologically distinguishable. In this manner, one may speak of whether two subsets of a topological space are ""near"" without concretely defining a metric on the topological space. Therefore, topological spaces may be seen as a generalization of metric spaces."" It seems to me (I am sure this is too naive) that I could equally well distinguish two points by using closed sets instead of opens. What am I missing? What is so crucial about opens that closed sets don't have/do? Update : I get the feeling that maybe opens are ""less precise"" than closed sets, in the sense that the boundary of a set, that the closed sets have, is an object with a rather precise ""position"". Opens seem to avoid having to be that precise about anything - I know this is vague. It might even be wrong, but it seems like it could be a useful intuition to differentiate opens and closeds?

Show that there exists $r>0$ such that $B(0, r)\subseteq f(\mathbb{D})$ for all $f\in\mathscr{F}$. Here's what I have so far: By Montel's Theorem, $|f(z)|\le 100$ implies that $\mathscr{F}$ is a normal family of functions. $\mathscr{F}$ is also closed, hence compact, so any sequence in $\mathscr{F}$ contains a subsequence that converges (in $\mathscr{H}(\mathbb{D})$) to a function in $\mathscr{F}$. Suppose that the conclusion is false; for each $n$, choose $f_n\in\mathscr{F}$ such that $f_n$ omits a value with modulus less than $\frac{1}{n}$. Let $f_n\to f\in\mathscr{F}$. Now, how do I get to the contradiction that $f$ cannot be in $\mathscr{F}$? I've tried saying that $f$ maps a neighborhood of $0$ to a neighborhood of $0$ that contains a disk of some radius, since $f'(0)\not=0$. For large enough $n$, the image of the same neighborhood under $f_n$ omits values in that disk, and as $n$ grows the omitted values do not tend to the boundary.

466178,The homology of the torus.,"I am reading ""Riemann surface"" by Donaldson. On page 68, the calculation of the first homology of the torus $T$ is given but there are several steps that I don't understand. Here is the calculation. Consider the torus $T$ and take standard angular co-ordinates $\theta, \phi \in [0, 2\pi]$.
  Let $\gamma_1, \gamma_2 \subset T$ be the standard embedded circles corresponding to $\theta=0, \phi=0$, respectively.
  Then the map
  $$\alpha \mapsto \bigg( \int_{\gamma_1} \alpha, \int_{\gamma_2} \alpha\bigg)$$
  induces a linear map from $H^1(T)$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$, since the integral of $df$ around the $\gamma_i$ vanishes for any function $f$ on $T$.
  The forms $d\theta$ and $d\phi$ show that this map is surjective.
  We claim that the map is also injective, so $H^1(T)=\mathbb{R}^2$.
  For, if $\alpha=P d\theta +Q d\phi$ is a closed 1-form with integral $0$ around $\gamma_2$, then for any fixed $\phi$ we have, by Stokes' Theorem,
  $$ (1) \int_0^{2\pi} P(\theta, \phi)d\theta=0.$$
  This means that the indefinite integral
  $$f(\theta, \phi)=\int_0^{\theta} P(u, \phi)du$$
  defines a smooth function on $T$ with $\partial f / \partial \theta=P$.
  Thus $\tilde{\alpha}=\alpha -df$ is a closed 1-form of the form $\tilde Q d \phi$. 
  But the closed condition implies that $Q$ is constant and, if the integral around $\gamma_1$ is zero, this constant must be zero and $\alpha=df$. Questions:
1. The first thing I want to understand is how to get (1). How do I useStokes' Theorem here? For which surface and boundary do I use Stokes' Theorem? 2.Why does (1) mean $f(\theta, \phi)$ denies a smooth function on $T$?

 and let $\mathbb{P}_m | i \rangle$ be the set $\mathbb{P}_m$ with each of its elements in the $i^{th}$ state. We define the sets to not be pairwise disjoint in the following way: Let $N$ be an index set such that $\forall m \in N$ let   $\mathbb{P}_m$ be a set. Therefore we have $$ \mathbb{P}_m \mid  \bigcap_{m \in N} \mathbb{P}_m | i \rangle\neq O$$ in other words  $\exists \phi_{i1} , \phi_{i2} , \ldots , \phi_{in} \in \mathbb{P}_1, \mathbb{P}_2, \ldots, \mathbb{P}_n  \mid \phi_{i1} \equiv \phi_{i2}  \equiv \cdots \equiv \phi_{in} $ The Mathematics of Probabilistic Sets A Probabilistic Set can be thought of as a set of normalised wave functions $\Phi_{im}$  that have at least one state in common and therefore have a finite probability of intersection. Union of Probabilistic Sets The union of probabilistic sets can be defined quite trivially as $$\bigcup_{m \in N} \mathbb{P}_m : = \{ \Phi_{11}, \Phi_{12}, \ldots, \Phi_{1N}, \Phi_{21}, \Phi_{22}, \ldots,  \Phi_{2N}, \ldots ,\Phi_{1n}, \Phi_{2n}, \ldots, \Phi_{nN} \}$$ Intersection of Probabilistic Sets It should be fairly clear that two probabilistic sets $\mathbb{P}_m$ and $\mathbb{P}_K$ do not have a well defined intersection. Instead we may discuss the \textit{probability} of two such sets intersecting. \
 The probability of intersection of the probabilistic sets shall be denoted $$\mathcal{P} \Big( \bigcap_{m \in N} \mathbb{P}_m | i \rangle \Big)$$ 
We can define $\Phi_{im} (\phi_{im})$ to be the wave function for $\Phi_{im}$ where $\phi_{im}  \equiv  [\alpha_i, \beta_i]$. So we define a state $\phi_{im}$ to be the corresponding interval $[\alpha_i,\beta_i]$ on the wave function $\Phi_{im} (\phi_{im})$. It now follows that the probability of finding the element $\Phi_{im}$ in the state $\phi_{im}$ is given by 
$$ P_{\phi_{im} \in \Phi_{im}} = \int_{\alpha_i}^{\beta_i} d \phi_{im} \Big| \Phi_{im} (\phi_{im}) \Big|^2$$
If only one such $\phi_{im}$ per set exists satisfying $\phi_{i1} , \phi_{i2} , \ldots , \phi_{in} \in \mathbb{P}_1, \mathbb{P}_2, \ldots, \mathbb{P}_n  \mid \phi_{i1} \equiv \phi_{i2}  \equiv \cdots \equiv \phi_{in} $, then the probability of the intersection of sets is given by 
$$ \mathcal{P} \Big( \bigcap_{m \in N} \mathbb{P}_m | i \rangle \Big) = \prod_{m \in N} \Big( \int_{\alpha_i}^{\beta_i} d \phi_{im} \Big| \Phi_{im} (\phi_{im}) \Big|^2 \Big)_m$$ 
However if two such states are equivalent per set, call this second equivalent state $\phi_{jm}$ the probability becomes 
$$  \mathcal{P} \Big( \bigcap_{m \in N} \mathbb{P}_m | i \rangle \Big) = \prod_{m \in N} \Big( \int_{\alpha_i}^{\beta_i} d \phi_{im} \Big| \Phi_{im} (\phi_{im}) \Big|^2  + \int_{\alpha_j}^{\beta_j} d \phi_{jm} \Big| \Phi_{jm} (\phi_{jm}) \Big|^2 \Big)_m$$
Now we extend this to the obvious case of: what if such elements share $\mathfrak{R}$ equivalent states? Well intuitively the probability of such an intersection occurring  approaches $1$ as $\mathfrak{R} \to n$. Trivially following from the previous two equations, the probability of intersection is given by  $$  \mathcal{P} \Big( \bigcap_{m \in N} \mathbb{P}_m | i \rangle \Big) = \prod_{m \in N} \Big(  \sum_{\mathfrak{r} \leq \mathfrak{R}} \Big( \int_{\alpha_i}^{\beta_i} d \phi_{im} \Big| \Phi_{im} (\phi_{im}) \Big|^2 \Big)_\mathfrak{r}  \Big)_m$$ Is everything I'm doing thus far correct?

466325,Can we reconstruct a DE from its general solution?,"If we think of a differential equation as being a 'problem' and the set of all solutions to the DE as being the 'general solution,' then my question is this: Question: Under what circumstances can we reconstruct the problem from the general solution? Lets make that more precise. Definition 1 .

466346,Proof that multiplying by the scalar 1 does not change the vector in a normed vector space.,"I'm beginning a self-study of functional analysis, and I seem to have come to a halt trying to solve the first problem in the first problem set, and was wondering if someone could give me a pointer. The problem asks to show that, while the property $1\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{a}$ must be included in the axioms of a vector space, it is a property that can be derived from the axioms of a normed vector space. The axioms for a vector space $V$ over the field $\mathbf{R}$ given in the book are as follow: $V$ is a group. For each $\alpha\in\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{a}\in V$, $\alpha\mathbf{a}\in V$ $\alpha(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b})=\alpha\mathbf{a}+\alpha\mathbf{b}$ $(\alpha+\beta)\mathbf{a}=\alpha\mathbf{a}+\beta\mathbf{a}$ $\alpha(\beta\mathbf{a})=(\alpha\beta)\mathbf{a}$ $1\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{a}$ The axioms for a normed vector space are 1--5 plus the additional axiom that there is a map $\Vert\cdot\Vert:V\to\mathbf{R}$ that satisfies all the properties of a norm. The problem formally stated now is to show that 1--5 do not imply 6, but 1--5 together with the norm do imply 6. This problem seems similar to the question posed here , and from the discussion of that question it seems an easy example of a vector space satisfying 1--5 but not 6 would be one where scalar multiplication always yields the zero vector. This cannot be the case in a normed vector space, because for $\mathbf{a}\neq0$ and $\alpha\neq0$ we know $\Vert\mathbf{a}\Vert\neq0$, and a norm satisfies $\Vert\alpha\mathbf{a}\Vert=\vert\alpha\vert\Vert\mathbf{a}\Vert\neq0$, but we also have $\Vert\alpha\mathbf{a}\Vert=\Vert\mathbf{0}\Vert=0$ from our definition of scalar multiplication, which is a contradiction. It is trivial that $1\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{a}$ if every vector in $V$ can be written as a scalar multiple of a vector in $V$, since then $\mathbf{a}=\alpha\mathbf{b}=(1\alpha)\mathbf{b}=1(\alpha\mathbf{b})=1\mathbf{a}$, but while the norm has ruled out the strange case of scalar multiplication that means only $\mathbf{0}$ can be written as a scalar multiple of a vector, I haven't been able to convince myself that other cases where there exist vectors that are not scalar multiples of a vector have been ruled out. Can anyone offer a pointer for how to show every vector in a normed vector space can be written as a scalar multiple of a vector in the space, or perhaps point me to a more natural way of approaching this problem? Thanks.","['vector-spaces', 'normed-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

However, there are three pieces I could not stitch up for one of his proofs. Wonder if someone may help? Later: alternatively, one can do a bit of magic. Since there is a covering $S^2\to P^2$ with $2$ sheets, we know that the Euler characteristics of $S^2$ and $P^2$ are related by $\chi(S^2)=2\chi(P^2)$ . Since $\chi(S^2)=2$ , we conclude that $\chi(P^2)=1$ . Since $P^2$ is of dimension $2$ , we have $\dim H^p(P^2)=0$ if $p>2$ ; since $P^2$ is non-orientable, $H^2(P^2)=0$ ; finally, since $P^2$ is connected, $H^0(P^2)\cong\mathbb R$ . It follows that $1=\chi(P^2)=\dim H^0(P^2)-\dim H^1(P^2)=1-\dim H^1(P^2)$ , so that $H^1(P^2)=0$ . So my questions are: Why since $P^2$ is non-orientable, $H^2(P^2)=0$ since $P^2$ is connected, $H^0(P^2)\cong\mathbb R$ $\chi(P^2)=\dim H^0(P^2)-\dim H^1(P^2)$ ?

We say $T$ is mixing for sets $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$ if $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\mu \{T^{-n}(A) \cap B \} = \mu (A) \mu (B)$$ I'm trying to show that it suffices to check the mixing property on an algebra generating $\mathcal{A}$. In other words: if $\mathcal{A}_0$ is an algebra that generates $\mathcal {A}$, then $T$ is mixing for all $A, B \in \mathcal {A}$ if $T$ is mixing for all $A, B \in \mathcal {A}_0$. I figured the easiest thing to do would be start by showing that, for fixed $B$, the set $$\Gamma _B := \{A : T \text{  is mixing for the pair } A,B\}$$ is a ""monotone class"" (i.e. closed under nested countable unions and intersections). This would show $\mathcal {A} \subset \Gamma _B$.  Then try to make the same argument with $A$ and $B$ flipped.   However, when I do this I run into a double limit that doesn't seem to commute. I'm pretty sure that I can show (using the dominated convergence theorem) that $\Gamma _B$ is closed under countable disjoint unions as well as compliments.  Therefore it would also suffice to show its closed under finite intersection.

466373,Proof of a method to find the points of maximum slope,"According to method described in a paper [1] if we want to find points of maximum slope in a signal $f(t)$, then one has to do following Convolve $f(t)$ with $g(t)$ where $g(t)=-cos(\omega t).(1/\sigma\sqrt{2.\pi}).e^{(-0.5.t^2/\sigma^2))}$ a modulated gaussian curve. Local maximas in $f(t)*g(t)$ will correspond to points with maximal slope in $f(t)$ Here is the simulation result done to check the veracity. Blue curve is sine wave ($f(t)$). Green curve is $g(t)$. Red curve is $f*g$. As one can see, points of maximal slope in $f(t)$ indeed do occur at maximas in $f*g$. Question How to mathematically show that local maximas in $f*g$ correspond to points of maximum slopes in $f$? I did this much analysis -
Points with maximum slope will be points at which $df/dt$ will be maximum i.e. $d^2f/dt^2 = 0$ On the other side, $(f*g)(t) = \int_{-\inf}^{+\inf}g(\tau).f(t-\tau)d\tau$ I don't know how to write it in math notation but we have to prove that $t$ at which $d^2f/dt^2 = 0$ is same $t$ at which $d(f*g)(t)/dt = 0$ occurs.

Define Norm of $\alpha\in K$ to be $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ where the product is taken over all the embeddings of K into an algebraic closure of F. Define Trace of $\alpha\in K$ to be $\large \Sigma \sigma(\alpha)$ where the product is taken over all the embeddings of K into an algebraic closure of F. First Question is to prove that $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha) \in F$ and $\large \Sigma \sigma(\alpha) \in F$ What i suppose is that $K/F$ has to be galois, I mean if it is galois, it would be easy to see $\tau(\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha))=\large \Pi \tau\sigma(\alpha)=\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ (for a fixed $\tau$,  if $\sigma$ varies over all elements of galois group, $\tau\sigma$ varies over all elements of the group).i.e., $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ is fixed by $\tau$. This holds for all $\tau\in Gal(K/F)$ thus, $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ has to be in $F$ as only elements which are fixed by all elements of $Gal(K/F)$ are elements of $F$. Thus, $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha)$ has to be in $F$. For similar reasons, one can see that $\large \Sigma \sigma(\alpha) \in F$. So, If it is Galois, I am able to see, But, result is true in general. I am unable to convince myself that $\large \Pi \sigma(\alpha) \in F$ and $\large \Sigma \sigma(\alpha) \in F$ for any finite Extension $K/F$ To be frank, I did not understand what does ""all embeddings of $K$ into algebraic closures of $F$"" mean. :( Second Question is to prove $N_{K/F}(ab)=N_{K/F}(a)N_{K/F}(b)$ and $Tr_{K/F}(ab)=Tr_{K/F}(a)+Tr_{K/F}(b)$. This can be seen easily as $\sigma$ are homomorphisms. Another Question is : Let $m_{\alpha}(x)=x^d+a_d x^{d-1}+....+a_1 x+a_0\in F[x]$ be minimal polynomial for $\alpha\in K$ over $F$. Let $n=[K:F]$. Prove that $d$ divides $n$, that there are $d$ distinct Galois conjugates of $\alpha$ (does he mean $K/F$ is Galois??) which are all repeated $n$ times in the product and sum above and conclude that $N_{K/F}(\alpha)=(-1)^na_0^{n/d}$ and $Tr_{K/F}(\alpha)=-\frac{n}{d}a_{d-1}$. For this, as $\alpha\in K$ and $n=[K:F]$, the collection $1,\alpha,\alpha^2,.....,\alpha^{n-1},\alpha^n$ is linearly dependent, so, i have $b_0+b_1\alpha+b_2\alpha^2+.....+b_n\alpha^n=0, b_i\in F$. So, I have a polynomial $g(x)=b_0+b_1 x+b_2 x^2+.....+b_n x^n$ for which $\alpha$ is a root, by minimality of $m_{\alpha}(x)$ we see that $m_{\alpha}(x)$ divides $g(x)$ and so, $d$ (power of x in $m_{\alpha}(x)$) divides $n$ (power of x in $g(x)$) Assuming $K/F$ is cyclic, i can some how see that there are $d$ distinct Galois conjugates of $\alpha$ (I may not be able to explain it clearly now, but i am quite sure about it).

Prove that $\rho$ is a sum of two one-dimensional representations. All these exercises are closely related to $GL_2(\mathbb C)$ , and I think it's closely related to the property of $U_2$ , the unitary group, therefore they go together. We can simplify both questions in nearly the same way. The first one: It's not hard to show the correctness of abelian case, therefore we discard this case for now. Suppose there's a nontrivial 2D representation $\rho$ of a finite simple group $G$ . Since $\rho$ is nontrivial and $G$ is simple, $\ker\rho$ is trivial, and $G$ embeds as a subgroup of $GL_2$ . By Maschke's theorem, WLOG, we can suppose that $G\subset U_2$ . Moreover, consider the mapping $\det\colon G\to\mathbb C$ , we have $\ker\det$ is nontrivial, since $G$ isn't abelian, therefore by the normality of $G$ , the image is trivial, and $G\subset SU_2$ , the special unitary group. The second one: We can only consider the image of $\rho$ . It's a finite group whose matrices have eigenvalue $1$ . We'd only show that these matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable, therefore $\rho$ is a direct sum of two 1D representations. WLOG, suppose that the image is contained in $U_2$ , by Maschke's theorem. Both problems are simplified as a property of $U_2$ (the first one reduces a bit more). The first one says that there's no simple subgroup of composite number order, the second one says that if they all have eigenvalue $1$ , then they're simultaneously diagonalizable.

This is very different than the non-disrete lattice generated by $(1,0), (0,1), (\sqrt 2, \sqrt 2)$, which is everywhere dense. These examples are a bit contrived, but in higher dimensions/more general fields, I have a hard time determining the resulting characteristics of the 'lattice.' For example, is it easy to tell how 'dense' the resulting 'lattice' is? Does this come up/are there known applications of this to, say, number theory? To be specific: Is there a name for the concept of what I've been calling a 'non-discrete lattice?' Can you point me to reference material on 'non-discrete lattices?'","['integer-lattices', 'reference-request', 'number-theory']"
466555,Is this proof that every convergent sequence is bounded correct?,"I've tried the following proof that a convergent sequence is bounded but I'm not sure if it is correct or not. Let $(M,d)$ be a metric space and suppose $(x_k)$ is a sequence of points of $M$ that converges to $a \in M$. Since the sequence is convergent, for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there is some $k_0$ such that if $k > k_0$ then $x_k \in B(a;\varepsilon)$. In that case, there is a finite number of points of the sequence, namely $\{x_{1},\dots,x_{k_0} \}$ that can be still outside of the ball. In that case, consider $r = \max\{d(a,x_i) : 1 \leq i \leq k_0\}+1$, then I claim that for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ we have $x_k \in B(a;r+\varepsilon)$. In truth, first it's obvious that $B(a;\varepsilon)\subset B(a;r+\varepsilon)$ because if $y \in B(a;\varepsilon)$ then $d(y,a) < \varepsilon < \varepsilon + r$ since $r > 0$. Also, by definition of $r$, we know that $\max\{d(a,x_i) : 1 \leq i \leq k_0\} < r < r+\varepsilon$ and so each $d(a,x_i) < r+\varepsilon$ so that $\{x_1, \dots, x_{k_0}\}\subset B(a;\varepsilon+r)$. Since the points $x_k$ for $1 \leq k \leq k_0$ are in the ball and the points $x_k$ for $k > k_0$ are in the ball, we conclude that every $x_k \in B(a;\varepsilon+r)$ and so the sequence is bounded. Is this proof correct or there are any problems with it? Thanks very much in advance!","['sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification', 'metric-spaces']"

466603,"Evaluate $\int \sqrt{ \frac {\sin(x-\alpha)} {\sin(x+\alpha)} }\,\operatorname d\!x$?","How to go about evaluating the following integral? $$ I = \int \sqrt{ \dfrac {\sin(x-\alpha)} {\sin(x+\alpha)} }\,\operatorname d\!x$$ What I have done so far: $$ I = \int \sqrt{ 1-\tan\alpha\cdot\cot x }\,\operatorname d\!x$$
Let $ t^2 = 1-\tan\alpha\cdot\cot x $ $$ \begin{align} 
 2t\,\operatorname d\!t &= \tan\alpha \cdot \csc^2x\,\operatorname d\!x \\
 & = \tan\alpha \cdot \Bigg(1 + \Big(\dfrac{1-t^2}{\tan\alpha}\Big)^2\Bigg)\,\operatorname d\!x \\
 & = \dfrac{\Big(\tan^2 \alpha + (1-t^2)^2\Big)}{\tan \alpha}dx \end{align}$$ So, from that:
$$\begin{align}
 I &= \int \sqrt{ 1-\tan\alpha\cdot\cot x }\,dx \\
 & = \int \dfrac{2t^2\tan\alpha}{\Big(\tan^2 \alpha + (1-t^2)^2\Big)}\, \operatorname d\!t \\

I had thought of doing a substitution: $u = 1-t^2$ but that doesn't work as you need one more $t$ term in the numerator.","['calculus', 'integration', 'indefinite-integrals']"

466641,Krull dimension and Hausdorff dimension,"Let $V$ be an irreducible algebraic variety over $\bf{C}$. Then the Krull dimension of the associated coordinate ring, its dimension as a topological space with the Zariski topology, and its Morley degree from model theory all coincide. What about the Hausdorff dimension? For simplicity assume that $V \subseteq \bf{C}^n$ is the set of common zeroes of polynomials in a prime ideal of height $k$. If we embed $V$ naturally in $\bf{R}^{2n}$, it is very reasonable to assume that it will have Hausdorff dimension $2n - 2k$. How to prove this?

We already know that $$f_1(\mathbf{x}) = f_2(\mathbf{x}) = \cdots = f_{N-1}(\mathbf{x})$$
where 
$$f_l(\mathbf{x}) =\frac{ |DFT[x]|}{\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} x_i} =\frac{ |\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} x_i w^{il}|}{\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} x_i}, \qquad w:=e^{-j2\pi/N}$$ This problem is comprised of $2K$ unknowns ($P$ and non-zero elements of $\mathbf{x}$) and $N-2$ equations, therefore this is an over-determined system of equations, and generally it has Least Square solution.
After evaluation of LS solution for many $(N,K)$ pairs, I reached these results (facts): For almost all cases, the solution for $P$ was $P$(s) whose Difference Multiset has minimum variance . Where Difference Multiset of a point-set is defined : $D = \{a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_{N-1}\}$ and $a_d$ is the number of occurrences of $d = p_i-p_j \mod N, \quad i \ne j$ The  $\mathbf{x}$ solution for all cases, was a solution with close non-zero elements, i.e. ($x_i \approx x_j, i,j\in P$) This figure shows the LS solution for the $(N,K) = (20,7)$ Someone asked how I solved this problem. For finding the best $P$ ($P$ leading to least error in LS solution) I used combinatorial search and after finding $P$, the remaining problem is a continuous least square that is solvable using many optimization methods, such as Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt, ... . Here is how $f_l(x^*)$ is distributed for $l=0,1,\cdots,N-1$: My question is, how to prove the first fact analytically or even intuitively? I asked it in MO too.","['optimization', 'fourier-analysis', 'discrete-mathematics', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"
