3573262,Proof verification: determining the dimension of a polynomial ring from the going up theorem.,"I decided to prove that for any field $k$ , dim $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] = n$ . Every proof I've seen follows either of these two approaches: Noether normalisation (first prove that if $A$ is a finitely generated domain over $k$ , then $\dim A = \text{trdeg}(K(A)/k)$ . Now the desired result is a special case.) Going down theorem. However I believe I've written a proof which is independent of either of these results (and is more elementary). Can someone please verify this? Lemma. If $A \to B$ is an integral extension of rings, then $\dim A = \dim B$ . This follows from the going up theorem. Proof that $\dim k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] = n$ .
It's clear that $\dim k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \geq n$ , so we proceed by induction on $n$ to show that $\dim k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \leq n$ . The base case is trivial. Now fix $m$ , and suppose $\dim k[x_1, \ldots, x_m] = m$ . Suppose for a contradiction that $\dim k[x_1, \ldots, x_{m+1}] > m+1$ , and let $P_0 \subset \cdots \subset P_{s}$ be a strictly increasing chain of prime ideals in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_{m+1}]$ with $s > m+1$ . Assume without loss of generality that $P_0 = 0$ . Choose any non-zero element of $P_1$ , and decompose it into irreducible factors. Since $P_1$ is prime, at least one of these factors $f$ lies in $P_1$ , so now consider the strictly increasing chain of primes $$0 \subset (f) \subset \cdots \subset P_s.$$ Since $f$ has degree at least 1, choose any $x_i$ that appears in the expression of $f(x_1, \ldots, x_{m+1})$ . (Without loss of generality, $x_i = x_{m+1}$ .) Viewing $f$ as a polynomial in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_{m}][x_{m+1}]$ , it is still irreducible, so we now have a finite (hence integral) extension $$k[x_1, \ldots, x_m] \to \frac{k[x_1, \ldots, x_m][x_{m+1}]}{(f)}.$$ By the earlier lemma and the inductive hypothesis, the right side has dimension $m$ . But this is a contradiction, since the chain of primes $(f) \subset \cdots \subset P_s$ descends to a strictly increasing chain of prime ideals in $\frac{k[x_1, \ldots, x_m][x_{m+1}]}{(f)}$ , of length $s-1 > m$ . Therefore $\dim k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \leq n$ for any $n$ , as required. I feel like the only `` non-elementary"" step was the use of the going up theorem, but this is quite distinct from NNL or going down (and somehow feels more elementary than those) so I'd appreciate if someone could verify this. Thank you!","['commutative-algebra', 'krull-dimension', 'algebraic-geometry', 'solution-verification', 'dimension-theory-algebra']"
3573345,haussdorfness $\iff$ limits of all nets are unique,"Prove that topological space $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if limits of all nets
  in it are unique. Let $X$ be Hausdorff and $S:D\to X$ be a net in it where $D$ is a directed set. Let $S$ has two limits $x,y\in X$ . We need to prove that $x=y$ . Suppose $x\neq y$ , therefore by Hausdorffness, there exists $U,V$ open sets in $X$ containing $x,y$ respectively such that $U\cap V=\emptyset$ . Now by defintion of convergence, there exist $m_1,m_2\in D$ such that for all $n\in D$ , $n\geq m_1$ implies $S(n)\in U$ and $n\geq m_2$ implies $S(n)\in V$ . Again by definition of directed set, there exists $n\in D$ such that $n\geq m_1$ and $n\geq m_2$ . This implies $S(n)\in U\cap V$ , a contradiction. Hence $x=y$ and our first part is proved. Now for the converse, if we take limits of all nets are equal, and WLOG assume $X$ is not Hausdorff. Then for $x,y\in X$ , $x\neq y$ , we would have two open sets containing $x,y$ respectively which are not disjoint. But I can't get a contradiction this way. How to proceed for this converse part? Any help is appreciated.","['general-topology', 'nets']"
3573359,Average squared absolute value of inner product between some unit vectors in a Hilbert space,"Let $S$ be a finite set of unit vectors in $d$ -dimensional complex Hilbert space $l_2^d$ . I believe (from numerical experiment) that $\frac{1}{\lvert S \rvert^2} \sum_{x,y \in S} \lvert \langle x,y \rangle \rvert^2 \geq \frac1d$ . In other words, if I choose two vectors from $S$ at random and take the squared absolute value of their inner product, the expectation is at least $\frac1d$ , for any initial choice of $S$ . This feels like it should have a simple proof but it has eluded me. Edited to add: a more general, but actually equivalent, statement is the following. Given an arbitrary probability distribution on the unit sphere of $l_2^d(\mathbb{C})$ , if $x$ and $y$ are chosen independently from this distribution, then $\mathbf{E}(\lvert \langle x, y \rangle \rvert^2) \geq \frac1d$ .","['probability', 'inner-products', 'hilbert-spaces', 'inequality', 'complex-numbers']"

3573399,Construct a bijective monotone function whose inverse is not monotone,"The reason of this question is an exercise in category theory: Find a counterexample to the following statement: A monotone function $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ between posets $X$ and $Y$ which is a bijection on the underlying sets (an isomorphism in $\mathcal{S}et$ ) is necessarily an isomorphism in $\mathcal{P}arset$ . In short, this exercise asks me to give a bijective monotone function whose inverse is not monotone. In this link: Are monotonic and bijective functions the same? the accepted answer gives an example that $f(x)$ is bijective but not monotone. I tried to define $f^{-1}(y)$ as the same as $f(x)$ defined in this post, and compute the $f$ . Then we can have $f^{-1}(y)$ not monotone and $f$ bijective. However, the problem is after the computation, I found that $f$ has the same expression as $f^{-1}$ in the same regions, which implies that $f$ is not monotone. I also tried different constructions using linear function, it turned out that we can easily arrive either both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are monotone or neither of them is monotone. Is there any other possible construction I can follows? By the way, in all the attempts I made, the construction is on $X=(\mathbb{R},\leq)$ and $Y=(\mathbb{R},\leq)$ , so it is perhaps easier to choose other partially ordered set, for instance $Y:=(2^{\mathbb{R}},\subset)$ , but then I don't know how to construct a bijective monotone function at all...(overall in the category theory, the monotone function can be respect to different partial orders, for instance, $x_{1}\leq_{X} x_{2}$ implies $f(x_{1})\leq_{Y} f(x_{2})$ .)

3573597,Graph has at least 2 cycles of equal length if e(G)=2v(G)-3,"As the title says, I am trying to show that if a graph $G$ is such that $v(G)\geq4$ and the number of edges it has is 3 less than twice the number of vertices, i.e. that $$ e(G) = 2v(G) - 3, $$ then the graph has at least 2 cycles of equal length. Progress: Clearly in order to be a cycle we need at least 3 vertices, so the possible cycle lengths are $$ 3,4,5, ... , v(G). $$ Now the minimum spanning tree $T$ is a tree and therefore its number of edges is $e(T) = v(G) - 1$ , and so by adding edges to get to $G$ we find that there are $v(G)-2$ edges to add. And since this was a tree each new edge will create a cycle. So we can assume that each additional edge creates a cycle with a distinct number of vertices, using all $v(G)-2$ possibilities. Now I obviously should find a contradiction somewhere, but I'm not sure exactly how. Any help?","['graph-theory', 'trees', 'discrete-mathematics']"

3573833,Conditional Probability: John and Mary's registration cards,"I am trying to solve a problem from a Dartmouth textbook ( https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf ) Chapter 4.1 Ex 53. Disclaimer: I am not a student. I am just studying some probability questions from the text book. Here is the question: The registrar is carrying John and Mary’s registration cards and drops them in a puddle. When he pickes them up he cannot read the names but on the first card he picked up he can make out Mathematics 23 and Government 35, and on the second card he can make out only Mathematics 23. He asks you if you can help him decide which card belongs to Mary. You know that Mary likes government but does not like mathematics. You know nothing about John and assume that he is just a typical Dartmouth student. From this you estimate: P (Mary takes Government 35) = .5 P (Mary takes Mathematics 23) = .1 P (John takes Government 35) = .3 P (John takes Mathematics 23) = .2 Assume that their choices for courses are independent events. Show that the card with Mathematics 23 and Government 35 showing is more likely to be Mary’s than John’s. The conjunction fallacy referred to in the Linda problem would be to assume that the event “Mary takes Mathematics 23 and Government 35” is more likely than the event “Mary takes Mathematics 23.” Why are we not making this fallacy here? Here is the solution from the manual: We assume that John and Mary sign up for two courses. Their cards are dropped, one of the cards gets stepped on, and only one course can be read on this card. Call card I the card that was not stepped on and on which the registrar can read government 35 and mathematics 23; call card II the card that was stepped on and on which he can just read mathematics 23. There are four possibilities for these two cards. They are: Card I          Card II          Prob.  Cond. Prob.

John(gov,math)  Mary(other,math) .0012  .179 In the third column we have written the probability that each case will occur. For example, for the first one we compute the probability that the students will take the appropriate courses: .5 × .1 × .3 × .2 = .0030 and then we multiply by 1/2, the probability that it was John’s card that was stepped on. Now to get the conditional probabilities we must renormalize these probabilities so that they add up to one. In this way we obtain the results in the last column. From this we see that the probability that card I is Mary’s is .597 and that card I is John’s is .403, so it is more likely that that the card on which the registrar sees Mathematics 23 and Government 35 is Mary’s. My question: It seems like the solution calculates the Probability of ""Other"" by Prob(John takes other) = 1 - Prob(John takes gov) - Prob(John takes math) = 1 - 0.3 - 0.2 = 0.5 See row 2: Mary(gov,math)  John(other,math), this is calculated as 0.5*0.1*0.5*0.2 / 2 = 0.0025 This subtraction above implies ""John takes gov"" is exclusive from ""John takes math"". But later they are multiplying Prob(John takes gov)*Prob(John takes math) to get the joint probability. I find this problem/solution not making sense. What do you guys think?

First question, is the isomorphism $k \rightarrow \mathscr O_{X,x}/ \mathfrak m_x$ required to be the composition $k \rightarrow \mathscr O_X (X) \rightarrow \mathscr O_{X,x} \rightarrow \mathscr O_{X,x}/ \mathfrak m_x$ or can the above morphism not be an isomorphism and we can just consider $x$ a rational point if there exists any isomorphism $k \xrightarrow{\approx}\mathscr O_{X,x}/ \mathfrak m_x$ ? Secondly, the definition from wikipedia considers two fields $k' \subset k$ and defines what it means for a point to be $k'-$ rational if your variety is over $k$ , how do we extend this relativity to Hartshornes definition? If you have a scheme over $k$ then you naturally have a scheme over $k'$ because of the map $\text{Spec}(k) \rightarrow \text{Spec}(k')$ and then we can talk about $k'-$ rational points as per the local ring definitions.

3574177,Find the price that will maximize the profit,"Given the functions for price (p) and cost (C): $p=75-.1\sqrt{x}$ $C=30x+400$ Find the price that will maximize the profit.

3574211,Definition of degenerate multivariate normal distribution,"I am reading some notes and having some trouble with the definition of multivariate normal distribution when the covariance matrix is not invertible. I will state my understanding below, and hopefully someone can chime in with some words of wisdom. Suppose $\Sigma$ is an $n\times n$ matrix. When $\Sigma$ is invertible, we say that a random vector $X$ has multivariate normal distribution with mean $0$ and covariance $\Sigma$ if it has density given by $f_X(x)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2}(\det{\Sigma})^{1/2}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}x^T\Sigma^{-1}x)$ Now, when $\Sigma$ is not invertible, then clearly the above density function is not defined. The notes mention the Cramer-Wold device can be used to define $N(0,\Sigma)$ in this case, and moves on without explicitly doing so. Could somebody please give a simplistic explanation/definition of $N(0,\Sigma)$ when $\Sigma$ is not invertible? Remark: For the univariate normal distribution, I understand that $N(0,0)$ corresponds to the degenerate distribution $\delta_0$ . By degenerate distribution, I mean it is $0$ with probability $1$ . I can not see how this would work in higher dimensions though!","['statistics', 'covariance', 'probability-distributions', 'normal-distribution', 'probability']"
3574213,About counting the number of graphs by the maximum Degree $D$.,"This is another way of attacking the problem that I posted on the link: What is the number of connected graphs with $n$ vertices of max. degree up to $P$? Leaving $F(x) = x + x^2 + 2x^3 + 6x^4 + 21x^5 + ...$ I noticed that there are no definitive studies in Graph Theory about counting graphs by degrees (for the maximum degree for example). There are counts of total graphs by the number of nodes, by the number of edges, and analyzes on regular graphs and sequences of degrees. An example, by the link Enumeration of Graphs with given Degree Sequence , is the asymptotic formula for the number $G_{d,n}$ of d-regular graphs on $n$ vertices with given degree sequence $d = (d,...,d)$ : $$G_{d,n} \sim \frac{(dn)!e^{-(d^2-1)/4}}{(dn/2)!2^{dn/2} \prod d_i!}$$ However, I found the sequence in OEIS: A243393 ,that represents the total of graphs with maximum degree up to 3. To my surprise there is no closed formula for the sequence! There does not seem to be an analytical formula for this problem, although it is early and unlikely to state this, as I have seen much more complex problems in mathematics be solved in a majestic way. Another way to tackle the problem would be experimental, and here's my question:
Is there an efficient method to find an approximate function of the curve that represents the sequence based on the given values? Below is a table containing the total number of connected simple graphs ( $A_n$ ) with a maximum degree up to 3, and some relations between the values, represented by graphics: Note in the first graph that the function $P(n)$ oscillates around a smooth curve, with a larger oscillation for small $n$ .
If the function $P(n)$ was estimated, we could obtain: $$A(n) \approx \prod_{i=2}^n P(i)$$ Note in the second graph that the difference $D(n) = P(n)-P(n-1)$ seems to oscillate around a constant $K$ .
We would have $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} D_n = K$ ? It seems that the upper and lower delimiting curves $\Phi(n)$ and $\phi(n)$ behave as positive and negative exponentials. See also in third graph that $Ln(A_n)$ seems to behave as a smooth exponential. Like this? $$ A(n) \approx  e^{e^{an + b}+ c} + d$$ Anyway, there seem to be many ways to try to approximate the function and many other relationships could be observed. What would be a good and efficient method? Could we perhaps find an asymptote for some relationship? We have $23$ computed values here, would that be little for us to make an analysis for generalization? Is there a method to find an approximate formula (function), even for small values of n?","['graph-theory', 'graphing-functions', 'functions', 'sequences-and-series', 'exponential-function']"

This is largely out of curiosity, as whether or not the surreals' nature as a proper class (collections which are not defined in a given universe of sets, and are treated informally for the most part, as far as ZFC is concerned) would allow for such a construction is a question that's been in the back of my mind for a while.

3575506,$S_n$ is a group,"This is an extremely simple fact, but I want to make sure that the assertions I am making are valid. In particular, I assert several times that a function is a permutation if and only if it is a bijection from a finite set to itself. If this is fine, I believe my arguments below are likely fine. I cannot think of a good counterexample to this. There are four requirements we need to verify: closed under product operations, associative, has an identity, and closed under inverses. Closed under product operation : An element of $S_n$ is a permutation of the elements $1, 2, \ldots, n$ . This is a bijection $\alpha: \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \to \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ . A composition of these bijections, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , is another bijection from $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ to $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ , and hnce $\alpha \beta$ is another permutation of the elements $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ . Associativity. An element of $S_n$ is a permutation, i.e., a function from a set to itself, and function composition can easily be shown to be associative. For simplicity, take $f, g, h$ to be well-defined functions that map $A$ to $A$ . For any $a \in A$ , we have: $$((f \circ g) \circ h)(a) = (f \circ g)(h(a)) = f(g(h(a))$$ $$(f \circ (g \circ h))(a) = f((g \circ h)(a)) = f(g(h(a)).$$ Hence, composing permutations is associative because permutations are just functions. Identity. The identity permutation, $\text{id}$ , sends every element to itself. For any $\alpha \in S_n$ and any $x \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots,n\}$ , we have: \begin{align*}
(\alpha \circ \text{id})(x) = \alpha(\text{id}(x)) = \alpha(x) \\
(\text{id} \circ \alpha)(x) = \text{id}(\alpha(x)) = \alpha(x).
\end{align*} Hence, the identity permutation is the identity element in the group. Inverses. Let $\sigma \in S_n$ . Then, $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ to $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ . A function is bijective if and only if it is invertible. Hence, another bijection, $\sigma^{-1}$ , also exists. Since this is a bijection from a set of finite elements to itself, it is also a permutation of $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ , and hence lives in $S_n$ .","['permutations', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'solution-verification']"
3575510,Generalization of scalar product to multiple vectors,"Let's look at the scalar product of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ : $$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_ka_k \cdot b_k
$$ I'm working my way through some physics problems where I have terms of the following form popping up: $$
\sum_k a_k \cdot b_k \cdot c_k \cdot \ldots
$$ This looks a little like a ""generalization of the scalar product"" to an arbitrary numbers of vectors to me. At the moment I'm making up my own notation by borrowing the "" $\circ$ "" symbol from the Hadamard product to write $$
\sum_ka_k \cdot b_k \cdot c_k \cdot \ldots = [ \mathbf{a} \circ \mathbf{b} \circ \mathbf{c} \circ \ldots ]
$$ where I'm using square brackets to imply summation over all elements. Since I also have to deal with powers of the elements in this sum, I mimick Hadamard powers that I've seen written with the same symbol: $$
\sum_k a^\alpha_k \cdot b^\beta_k \cdot c^\gamma_k \cdot \ldots = [ \mathbf{a}^{\circ\alpha} \circ \mathbf{b}^{\circ\beta} \circ \mathbf{c}^{\circ\gamma} \circ \ldots ]
$$ However I would like to know if there is already an accepted way to represent a sum like the one above so I wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel. In addition, so far I have only seen the Hadamard product defined for matrices, not vectors, so it's my working assumption that this would be acceptable use for the symbol as well. (I guess I could write this as a series of multiplications of diagonal matrices, however it feels a bit like overkill to introduce matrices if I know that none of my terms will ever have two indices to them.

3575524,How to define a function when you are unsure if the codomain exists as a set?,"In Tao's Analysis I , one of the ways that a function can be described is as follows: $f: X \to Y$ $f: x \mapsto f(x) = \text{ specific rule }$ (e.g. $f(x) = 2x$ ) That is to say, a function can be sufficiently described by providing a domain, codomain, and a specific mapping rule. While working through book exercises, I am running into situations where I do not yet know if a desired codomain is actually a set, and therefore I am reluctant to define functions that would otherwise help me with proofs. For example, let's say that I need to prove some set $Y$ exists (i.e. at the start, I do not know if $Y$ is a set), but I know that all ""would-be"" elements of $Y$ , as individual objects, certainly exist. There are times where it would be very useful for me to describe functions that map elements of a known set $X$ to these ""extant"" would-be elements of $Y$ . However, in order to use this function, I first need to know that $Y$ exists as a set; otherwise, I do not have a codomain and cannot define the function! From what I understand about ZFC axioms, I don't think I can just take an infinite collection of objects I know exist and slap on two surrounding set brackets and claim, ""Voilia! This is a set!"" (I think one can carry this out on finite collections of objects, however, by using the union axiom and the singleton & pair set axioms). At first, I was tempted into thinking that I could just take some sort of ""superset"" that definitely contains these would-be elements of $Y$ . However, after reading up on Cantor's theorem and Russel's paradox, I realize this strategy won't work (e.g. if my superset was defined as ""the set of all sets""). Any help would be greatly appreciated!","['functions', 'set-theory']"

However, I cannot find a proof of the equivalence of these two definitions which does not use the multivariable chain rule in some way; so I ask: 1) Does a proof of this equivalence exist without the multivariable chain rule, or
2) If this equivalence cannot be shown without the multivariable chain rule, are there any nice proofs of which you know (I have yet to find one I like, besides this one if it does work out).",['multivariable-calculus']

To see that the vanishing of the odd order derivatives is necessary, consider the following: $x \to f(|x|)$ is an even function, so all its odd-order derivatives vanish at zero.

Then we have to show that the natural map $I(B)_f \rightarrow I(B_f)$ is an isomorphism. Now, since $\pi$ is a closed embedding, we have the short exact sequence for $\operatorname{Spec} B \subset Y$ , $$0\rightarrow I(B)\rightarrow B\rightarrow A\rightarrow 0$$ where $\pi^{-1}(\operatorname{Spec} B)=\operatorname{Spec} A$ . By the exactness of localization we get, $$0\rightarrow I(B)_f\rightarrow B_f\rightarrow A_{\pi^{*}(f)}\rightarrow 0$$ where $\pi^{*}: B\rightarrow A$ is the local section map on $\operatorname{Spec} B$ .

3576507,Probability Based on a Grid of Lights,"The question is as follows : A grid of $n\times n$ ( $n\ge 3$ ) lights is connected to a switch in such a way that each light has a $50\%$ chance of lighting up when switched on. What is the probability that we see a closed curve after turning on the switch? A closed curve is basically a set of any number of lines that enclose an area (containing at least one light). The lines could be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal only (that is, making angles $0°, 90°$ or $45°$ with the horizontal), otherwise the curve would not be closed. A line is a line segment joining two illuminated lights. We only say a closed curve is formed, when all the lights except the ones that make up the boundary of the shape are switched off . To check if any configuration satisfies these conditions, connect all the lights (that you claim to be part of the boundary of a shape) through lines . If there’s any other illuminated light left out, then this configuration is invalid. Every illuminated light must be immediately next to at least one of the grid points that the curve encloses. As an example for what ‘immediately next to’ means, consider the $5\times5$ grid: $$\begin{matrix} 1&2&3&4&5 \\ 6& \color{blue}7 & \color{blue}8 &\color{blue}9 &10 \\ 11&\color{blue}{12} &\color{red}{13} & \color{blue}{14} & 15   \\16 & \color{blue}{17}&\color{blue}{18}&\color{blue}{19} &20 \\ 21&22&23&24&25 \end{matrix} $$ Here, the blue lights are immediately next to $13$ . This problem essentially comes down to counting the total number of such closed curves in an $n\times n$ grid. So I figured I might as well start off with the easy part. Now, every single configuration of the grid occurs with an equal probability of $P=\frac{1}{2^{n^2}}$ (as there are a total of $2^{n^2}$ cases possible). So, the required probability will be the number of possible closed curves $\space \times P$ .

3576912,Prove $\cos x +\cos y = 2\cos(\frac{x+y}{2})\cos(\frac{x-y}{2})$,"Prove that $$\cos(x) + \cos(y) = 2\cos(\frac{x+y}{2})\cos(\frac{x-y}{2})$$ holds true for any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ . Even though I managed to prove its brother $\sin(x) + \sin(y)$ , I haven't been able to tackle this one.
Important identities needed for the proof: $$\cos(x+y)=\cos(x)\cos(y)-\sin(x)\sin(y)$$ $$\cos(x-y)=\cos(x)\cos(y)+\sin(x)\sin(y)$$ Let's go: $$2\cos(\frac{x+y}{2})\cos(\frac{x-y}{2}) = 2\cos(\frac{x}{2}+ \frac{y}{2})\cos(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{y}{2}) = $$ $$ = 2(\cos(\frac{x}{2})\cos(\frac{y}{2}) - \sin(\frac{x}{2})\sin(\frac{y}{2}))(\cos(\frac{x}{2})\cos(\frac{y}{2}) + \sin(\frac{x}{2})\sin(\frac{y}{2})) = $$ $$ = 2(\cos^2(\frac{x}{2})\cos^2(\frac{y}{2}) - \sin^2(\frac{x}{2})\sin^2(\frac{y}{2})) = $$ $$ = 2\cos^2(\frac{x}{2})\cos^2(\frac{y}{2}) - 2\sin^2(\frac{x}{2})\sin^2(\frac{y}{2})$$ Now I tried, I believe, almost every possible replacement by deriving from $\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1$ and sadly nothing worked.",['trigonometry']
3576940,How to estimate this expectation involving two binomial random variables?,"$X$ and $Y$ are two independent binomial random variables where $X\sim B(K_1, q), Y\sim B(K_0, p)$ , (Suppose $p>q, p+q$ is not necessarily equal to 1). I am wondering how to compute the following expectation: $$ \mathbb{E}_X[X \ \text{Pr}(Y\geq \frac{q}{p}X)] = \sum_{t=0}^{K_1} t \text{Pr}(Y\geq \frac{q}{p}t) \text{Pr}(X=t).$$ Or at least give an upper and lower bound. I am also curious in another problem $\mathbb{E}_X[X \ \text{Pr}(Y\geq \frac{p}{q}X)]$ . If we assume that $K_0=K_1$ , then $Y$ and $\frac{p}{q}X$ have the same mean. This might be a more interesting case.","['expected-value', 'statistics', 'binomial-distribution', 'probability']"
