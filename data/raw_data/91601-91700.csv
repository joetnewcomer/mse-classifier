$$ Compute $f_x (0,0)$, $f_y (0,0)$, $f_{xx} (0,0)$, $f_{xy} (0,0)$, and determine where it is continuous.

1241774,"A fun card game involving probability, getting all 13 ranks (any suit(s)) vs. 5 in a row of red or black.","Two people, (call them C and D), decide to play a card game for fun.  They use an ordinary fair deck of $52$ cards, shuffled well before each hand is drawn, and randomly draw cards from it one a time without replacement, both using (sharing) the same drawn cards to determine who wins.  A win is defined as follows: C wins if he gets at least one of all $13$ ranks of the cards (regardless of suit as they can be mixed suit or even all the same suit) in a hand. D wins if he gets either $5$ reds or $5$ blacks in a row (consecutive) for a particular hand.  Each new hand starts with $0$ in a row so far so there is no ""carryover"" from a previous hand. It is possible that C and D can both ""win"" on the same card draw so normally that would be a tie but a ""twist"" in the game is that ties are awarded to C but not just as a single win.  Since ties are likely rare, C gets a triple win for ties.  That is, if C and D bet even money and they ""tied"", C would then win $3$ to $1$ odds of whatever D bet him for that particular hand.  So let's take an example run so there is no confusion.  Suppose they both bet $1$ dollar per hand and the following happens: D wins game $1$ so he is then up by $1$ dollar. C wins game $2$ so they are both back to even money. D wins the next $2$ games so he is then up $2$ dollars over C (C is down $2$ dollars). The next game is a tie so C is awarded $3$ dollars so is then ahead by $1$ dollar. Another way to think about it is to not think about money but just count up the number of wins.  If there is a tie, C gets awarded $3$ wins for that hand. So the question is who has the mathematical advantage here and by how much?  For example, if it was a rainy day and they played this game for many hands, who would likely be ahead as far as net money gained as a result of playing this game? Some interesting things to consider are: D can immediately win with only $5$ card draws while C requires $13$ minimum. It is possible that D will not win even if all the cards are drawn, never getting $5$ in a row of either color. A decision can take anywhere from $5$ to $49$ cards. $49$ is the max because imagine if $12$ of each rank (of all $4$ suits) have been chosen but D hasn't won yet for that hand, the next card will complete one of those set of ranks.  For example, if the last $4$ cards in the deck are all Kings (K), the $49$th card will give the win to C (assuming D doesn't win or tie). $$UPDATE$$ I ran a simulation of 1 billion decisions (ties included) and the results are as follows: C won : $469,102,581$ times.  (excluding triple wins for ties). D won : $514,835,119$ times. C,D tied :  $16,062,300$ times.  (C awarded triple win). C won : $517,289,481$ times.  (including triple wins for ties). Advantage for C: about $0.48$% Average # of cards drawn to make a decision is $20.579$. So the triple win award for ties gives C a very slight edge over D but without that D has a decent advantage.  So in theory, if they played this game for many hands, they would about break even.  However, in the shortrun, someone could take a sizable lead.  Sometime I may try about $10$ hands with actual cards and see what I get. I would like to know how to set this problem up mathematically or if it is even possible.  Perhaps we could first solve a simpler variation where we draw exactly $21$ random cards then check for a winner.  Perhaps that will give us some insight into how to solve the more general question with a variable # of cards (from $5$ to $49$ is possible.). Also, can someone tell me how to plot a graph on here because I have data for the # of wins of each # of cards drawn from $1$ to $52$.  The numbers show some interesting patterns.  Out of $1,000,000$ decisions, $5$ cards drawn accounts for the most wins at about $5$%.  Next is very close between $23, 24,$ and $25$ cards which account for about $4.4$% each.",['probability']

But why this second condition. Is there any theory that says if you are going to find two functions, you need two conditions, and then you are ok?

I have also seen the importance of $D:=\{z\in \mathbb{H} : -\frac 12 \leq \Re(z) \leq \frac 12 , |z|\geq 1 \}$, where $\mathbb{H}$ is the upper half plane, and the proof that $\gamma \in\Gamma$ sends $z\in\mathbb{H}$ to $\gamma z \in D$, and also that the points on the boundary of $D$ are the unique points where $\gamma z=z$, so that there are three points at which the stablilizer subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is not the identity matrix. My question is regarding the theorem that seems to follow on from these observations. We are given a function, $f$, that is meromorphic at $p$, and we define $v_p(f)$ to be  $k$, where $f(z)=(z-p)^k+\sum_{n=k+1}^\infty a_n(z-p)^n$. We also define $e_p$ to be $\frac{\#Stab(p)\subset SL_2(\mathbb{Z})}{2}$, which can take values of $1,2$ or $3$. Finally, if $f$ is weakly modular of weight $k$, define $v_{\infty}(f):=k$ s.t. $f=a_kq^k+\sum_{n=k+1}^\infty a_nq^n, a_k\neq 0$ The theorem states: $$v_{\infty}(f)+\sum_{p\:\in \:\mathbb{H}\:/\:SL_2(\mathbb{Z})}  \frac{v_p(f)}{e_p}=\frac{k}{12}$$ My main problem is that I don't understand the definition of $\mathbb{H}/SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$.

1242921,"Are basic trigonometry functions ( sine, cosine, tangent ) intuitive or memorized?","First, I'm really sorry for this somewhat vague and possibly just silly question. I also apologize if the following context runs a bit long. But please trust me that I'm asking with total sincerity and that my end goal is to find a starting point to grasp the one area of basic high school math that has always been just out of reach. To begin: I always hated math as a young child (multiplication tables, carry-the-one, borrow-from-left, etc), and it was only later when math actually started to get interesting that I realized I didn't hate math, I hated rote memorization of tables and blind-faith rules/functions/tricks that were easy to forget under pressure. Somewhere in middle school (pre-algebra, pre-geometry), things started to click. I don't want to suggest I was a math genius by any stretch, but I found that if I was keeping up conceptually with one module, the intro into the next had a nice ""Oh, yes, of course! That is the next logical step!"" feeling, so that I got to be the obnoxious kid who rolled his eyes at anyone struggling with a specific concept, thinking that it was so obvious that if we already know that the volume of a cylinder is the area of the circle on top times the height, why wouldn't a cone be one-third of that? As I continued through high school, things got trickier, but overall either things made sense, or eventually made sense if I carefully retraced my steps to see where I got lost, and occasionally, things made no damn sense until there was an awesome pop in my head, like realizing that matrices weren't really crazy and magical, they were just a way of lining up all of the variables in such a way that they could be easily dealt with all at once. Then we got to trigonometry functions. I basically bowed out at this point, took some honorably low B and C grades, knowing I just wasn't getting something, and never took any formal math classes ever again. Two things I've learned since then: You aren't really borrowing or carrying any one's, it's just a handy way of treating the top number as 10 + itself. Unless you are taking math classes in college meant for math majors, you always use a calculator to get the actual numbers when figuring sine, cosine, and tangent. That second part is crucial to my question. 20 years after hitting this math wall, I find out that it's not just easier to use a calculator for these functions, it's pretty much required (unless you've got your grandfather's slide rule, but this is basically the same idea, look it up). So my questions are: Are the trigonometric functions inherently something you just accept and learn and find a place in your brain for so that further concepts derive intuitively from that starting point, or do these concepts derive in a clear and somewhat intuitive (or at least straightforward) way from lower-level concepts that I've managed to not quite fit together on every 3-5 year skimming I attempt on the topic? I'm sure, since there are those who can actually provide proofs or calculate the functions without a calculator, that these functions were not just ""found"" or ""dreamt of"" or were the ramblings of one insane genius who could only provide the ratios, not the reasoning. So I get that they are arrived at from lower-level math. So what I really want to know is if my struggle to understand it the same way I had come to understand every other math concept is basically where I'm going wrong, like my long overdue discovery that calculators were essential to the process. (really sub 2) - If it really is just ""hard"" or ""learned"" or ""work"", I can accept that. Learning Latin verbs was hard and I knew I was getting low marks because I wasn't doing the work. But if there is some natural progression, and anyone can take a decent guess at some specific connection/concept that is most likely the ""missing piece"" (either because it usually is, or because this all sounds too familiar, or because you've got a knack for figuring out what's wrong just from senseless ramblings), I welcome any feedback or suggestions. Note that a big part of my initial apology (and reason for wording things as I have) is that I'm not looking for a tutor or a drawn-out lesson in trig (not here, at least), only some validation that either I am missing something that should make this easier than I'm making it sound, or that it actually is hard and my mistake is expecting every time to spot that thing I was missing.

1242923,Why does a Borel measurable function imply its Lebesgue measure?,"Borel measurable defined as: $f: D \rightarrow\mathbb R$ is Borel measurable if $D$ is a Borel set and for each $a\in\mathbb R$, the set $\{x\in D: f(x) > a\}$ is a Borel set.

Intuitively, I think Lebesgue measure function is essentially a function with both input and output(or say domain and range) being Lebesgue measurable sets. Since preimage of a Borel set is another Borel set as well under Lebesgue measurable function and Borel measurable function asks for a Borel set, a Lebesgue measurable set, as the image and with the domain is a Borel set as well, I can claim that a Borel measurable function is Lebesgue measurable.

If $Jr = R$, then $jr = 1$ for some $j \in J$. Note that $rj \in J$ since J is a left ideal, so $rj \neq 1$. Using a lemma, $1 - rj$ is not left invertible, which is to say that $R(1-rj) \neq R$. But then R(1-rj) is contained in a maximal left ideal, i.e. $1-rj \in R(1-rj) \subseteq J$, so $1= rj +(1-rj) \in J$, which gives a contradiction. Hence $Jr \neq R$. This implies that $Jr$ is contained in $J$. Since the choice of $r$ is arbitrary, $jr \in J$ for all $j \in J$ and $r \in R$. Hence, $J$ is a two sided ideal.

1243246,Example of a ring where all but two of its elements are units,"One way of viewing a field is just as a ring where all but one of its elements (namely $0$) is a unit. I'm looking for rings (commutative with a 1) where all but two of its elements are units. I found one fairly trivial example, $\mathbb Z/4 \mathbb Z,$ and I think I may have a proof that it's the only example of such a ring that's finite: If $R$ is some finite ring, then considering $R$ as an additive group and applying the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, we get that $R$ is isomorphic to a direct product of groups of the form $\mathbb Z/n_i \mathbb Z,$ and the $n_i$ are coprime. I believe that this means that $R$ is also isomorphic to this as a ring (is this correct?). For each $n_i$ the size of $\left(\mathbb Z/n_i \mathbb Z\right)^*$ is $\phi(n_i).$ Let $n=|R|$. Since $\phi$ is multiplicative over coprime elements, we have $n=\Pi_i n_i$ and $|R^*|=n-2=\Pi_i \phi(n_i)$. But $\phi(n_i)\leq n_i-1,$ so obviously there can only be one factor $\mathbb Z/n_1 \mathbb Z$. Then $n_1=n$ and all we need is that $\phi(n)=n-2$. Writing $n$ as a product of primes $n=2^{r_2}3^{r_3}5^{r_5}\cdots$ we get 
$$\phi(n)= n-2=\phi(2^{r_2})\phi(3^{r_3}) \phi(5^{r_5})\cdots\\
=(2^{r_2}-2^{r_2-1})(3^{r_3}-3^{r_3-1})(5^{r_5}-5^{r_5-1})\cdots
$$
Again, it's clear that there can only be one factor as otherwise the expression for $\phi(n)$ in the final line would be too small. Say $n=p^{r_p}$ and $p^{r_p}-2=p^{r_p}-p^{r_p-1}$ Then $p^{r_p-1}=2$. Hence $p=2$ and $r_p=2$ i.e. $n=4.$ Can anyone tell me whether this proof is correct or not. My main question: are there any more examples with infinite rings? I feel like the answer is no because it seems very hard to have so many units, but I have no idea how to start to prove this in general. I tried local rings: If $R$ was a local ring, with unique maximal ideal $I$, then $R=I\sqcup R^*$ so I need a maximal ideal containing all but two elements which seems impossible, but again I don't know how to prove it. Most of my intuition for this being false is coming from Lagrange I think. Lagrange says that subgroups can't get too large, in particular that if $|G|=n$ then any proper subgroup $H$ must have $|H| \leq n/2$. But Lagrange doesn't work for infinite groups, so I don't know if this intuition is at all valid.","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"

I see such matrices (arrays) as rather mathematically interesting objects, which can be said to represent a number of things, e.g. it's rows can be taken to be in the images of characteristic functions of all the combinations on an $n$ element set; or as all the valuations on $n$ propositional variables, in a logical context. This is just naming a few canonical interpretations of $A$. Anyone who's done any introductory logic, discrete mathematics, or computer science would have seen such matrices. It's columns are defined in a simple (as a recurrence relation?) manner. What interested me for sometime, was an explicit, functional representation of this matrix $A$, or it's sibling $B$ (with the $0$'s and $1$'s swapped). That is, I couldn't find anywhere the function: $$\theta: \mathbb N \times \mathbb N \rightarrow \{0,1\}$$ Such that on row-number and column-number input, it gives the matrix value for that row-column coordinate. Not succeeding in finding such a function, I decided to derive one myself (see below), for which I have a proof here . It's not the cleanest proof, but most of it is captured in a diagram that illustrates the key pattern, which makes it easier to follow. I'd appreciate any comments to the proof, or corrections if an error is spotted, or an obvious simple solution, which I missed, although that's not my main question here. The row ""coordinate"" is denoted with $k$ and the column one with $i$. $$\theta(k,i)= \left\lfloor \frac {k-1}{2^{i-1}} \right\rfloor - 2\left\lfloor \frac {k-1}{2^{i}}+\frac 12 \right\rfloor +1$$ The solution to the sibling matrix $B$ turns out to have a simpler form (I think this is correct, but I'm not entirely sure): $$\theta(k,i)= \left\lfloor \frac {k-1}{2^{i-1}} \right\rfloor - 2\left\lfloor \frac {k-1}{2^{i}} \right\rfloor $$ My question is this: where can I find a solution to this (perhaps someone can give a simpler one), or results that have this solution as an immediate corollary? Also, where could I read-up more about the properties of such matrices? For I can't believe that such solutions don't exist already, given the interesting nature of such mathematical objects. I suspect that the above solutions are special cases of a more general result; even more general than merely extending the image of $\theta$ to $\{0,1,...,n\}$ for all $n \in \mathbb N$, which shouldn't be a difficult exercise (I actually have that extended solution somewhere).","['matrices', 'recurrence-relations', 'binary', 'elementary-number-theory', 'logic']"

this. This is the solution I found. However, I find it to be very complicated. What does $\otimes_R$ mean? What does tensor product mean? I have not learn tensor product. I prefer a solution without it and using only concepts from elementary ring theory course. Is there simpler answer to this?","['abstract-algebra', 'chinese-remainder-theorem', 'ideals', 'ring-theory']"
1243511,Laguerre's theorem on power of a point w.r.t. an algebraic curve,"So on Wikipedia article for a power of a point there is a short section about Laguerre's theorem . The problem is, the article has no references, and whenever I'm trying to Google it the only things I get are either power diagrams or some different definitions of power of a point w.r.t. algebraic curve, but none of these seem to trace back to Laguerre's work. So my question is, as expected Can anyone give a reference to Laguerre's original work, or at least provide a place where properties of his definition (such as independence of the choice of the circle) are proven?","['algebraic-curves', 'geometry', 'reference-request']"
1243538,Simplifying the combinatorial expression $\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k {n \choose k} (x - k)^m$,"Can someone help me make sense of the following expression: $$f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k {n \choose k} (x - k)^m$$ Where $m$ is an integer. I ran into a special case of it while solving a recurrence relation. I observe the following behavior: When $m < n$, this is identically zero. When $m \geq n$, it is a polynomial of degree $m - n$. But I can't seem to make sense of why this is. I tried using the binomial theorem on $(x-k)^m$ to say $$f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \sum_{j=0}^m (-1)^{k + j} {n \choose k} {m \choose j} x^{m-j} k^j$$ but this seems to just make it messier.",['combinatorics']
1243540,How to calculate the solid angle of a spherical rectangle from astronomical angles,"Say I have 2 astronomical angle pairs defining a confined region on the visible hemisphere: (minAzimuth, minElevation) & (maxAzimuth, maxElevation) How can we calculate the solid angle of the projected area of the spherical rectangle on the unit sphere? I assume that azimuth makes little difference and results in a linear multiple: (maxAzimuth - minAzimuth)/(2*Pi). My intuition tells me that the elevation factor can be computed as: Sin(maxElevation) - Sin(minElevation) Thus the answer as a proportion of 1 would be:
(Sin(maxElevation) - Sin(minElevation)) * (maxAzimuth - minAzimuth)/(2*Pi). and for the answer in steradians multiply by 2*Pi. Is this correct? Many thanks for your efforts.","['geometry', 'analytic-geometry']"

I know that $g(T) = E[h(x) \mid T(x)]$ is UMVUE if $h(x)$ is an unbiased estimator and $T(x)$ is a complete sufficient statistic. I tried guessing that $\dfrac{1}{x}$ would be a UE of $\dfrac{1}{\theta}$ using $E\left( \dfrac{k}{x} \right) = \int_0^1 \left( \dfrac{k}{x} \right) \cdot \theta \cdot x^{\theta-1} \ dx$ , which gives $\dfrac{k \theta}{\theta - 1}$ , so $\dfrac{\theta-1}{x}$ is UE of $\theta$ . Here, we can apply invariance property to see that $\dfrac{x}{\theta - 1}$ is UE of $\dfrac{1}{\theta}$ . I also know that the MLE of $\dfrac{1}{\theta}$ is $-\dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \ln(x_i)$ .

1243572,How to understand the definition of weak convergence of stochastic processes,"I have some problems with the definition of $\textit{weak convergence of stochastic processes}$. To ask my question, we start with two well-known definitions corresponding to measures and random variables. $\textbf{Definition 1 (weak convergence of measures).}$ Suppose $\left(\mu_n\right)_{n =1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of probability measures. Then we say that $\mu_n$ converges weakly (or in distribution) to a probability measure $\mu$ and write $\mu_n \xrightarrow{\mathcal{D}} \mu$, if
  $$  \forall \, \varphi \in \mathcal{C}_b(\mathbb{R}) \colon \int_{\Omega} \varphi \, \text{d} \mu_n \xrightarrow{n \to \infty} \int_{\Omega}\varphi \, \text{d} \mu, $$
  where $\mathcal{C}_b(\mathbb{R})$ denotes the set of continuous and bounded functions. $\textbf{Definition 2 (weak convergence of random variables).}$ Suppose $\left( \Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P}\right)$ is a probability space and $\left(f_n\right)_{n =1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of random variables. Then we say that $f_n$ converges weakly (or in distribution) to a random variable $f$ and write $f_n \xrightarrow{\mathcal{D}} f$, if
  $$  \forall \, \varphi \in \mathcal{C}_b(\mathbb{R}) \colon \ \mathbb{E} \varphi(f_n)\xrightarrow{n \to \infty} \mathbb{E} \varphi(f) \Longleftrightarrow \int_{\Omega} \varphi(f_n(\omega)) \, \text{d} \mathbb{P}(\omega) \xrightarrow{n \to \infty} \int_{\Omega} \varphi(f(\omega)) \, \text{d} \mathbb{P}(\omega) \\
\Longleftrightarrow \int_{\Omega} \varphi \, \text{d} \mathbb{P}_{f_n} \xrightarrow{n \to \infty} \int_{\Omega}\varphi \, \text{d} \mathbb{P}_f.$$ These two definitions were clear to me. The following definition is the one I am asking about. $\textbf{Definition 3 (weak convergence of stochastic processes).}$ Suppose $f$ and $\left(f_n\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ are random variables with values in $\mathcal{C}([0,\infty))$. Then we say that the stochastic processes $\left(f_n\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converge to the stochastic process $f$, if the corresponding laws converge weakly in the topological space $\mathbb{S}$ consiting of $\mathcal{C}([0,\infty))$ equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on comapct subsets of $\mathcal{C}([0,\infty))$. That is, if $\varphi(f_n) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{D}} \varphi(f)$ whenever $\varphi \colon \mathcal{C}([0,\infty)) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ Borel measurable. Now my question is, how can I understand Definition $3$ in the sense of Definition $2$? Can I just replace $\varphi \in \mathcal{C}_b(\mathbb{R})$ by $\varphi \in \mathcal{C}([0,\infty))$?

Find the kernel and image of $T^2$. I will tell you exactly where i'm stuck, after applying $T$ on $(0,z,y,x)$ i'm pretty
sure i'll be getting $(0,y,z,0)$, to find the kernel i will compare it to $(0,0,0,0)$
which will tell me that $z = 0$ and $y = 0$. Now, this is what i am unsure of, should i write the $z = 0$ and $y = 0$ in the original $T$? should i write it on $(x,y,z,u)$ thus getting $(x,0,0,u)$ or should i forget the original and apply it on $(0,z,y,x)$ thus getting $(0,0,0,x)$.
