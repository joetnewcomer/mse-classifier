2164642,Proof of uniform limit of Continuous Functions,"The uniform limit of Continuous Functions is continuous. Proof Let $\varepsilon > 0$ . There exists $N$ in natural numbers such that $n>N$ implies $|f_n(x)-f(x)| < \frac{\varepsilon}{3}$ for all $x$ in $S$ .
In particular $|f_{N+1}(x)-f(x)| < \frac{\varepsilon}{3}$ for all $x$ in $S$ .
Since $f_{N+1}$ is continuous at $x_0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that, $x$ in $S$ and $|x-x_0| < \delta$ imply $|f_{N+1}(x)-f_{N+1}(x_0)|< \frac{\varepsilon}{3}$ Now we conclude $x$ in $S$ and $|x-x_0| < \delta$ imply $|f(x)-f(x_0)|< 3 \cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{3} = \varepsilon$ .

2164682,Projection onto convex set and a translated version,"Let $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a closed convex set containing the origin. Let $\Pi_K$ denote the Euclidean projection onto $K$. I would like to show that for any fixed $x_0 \in K$,
$$\sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \left|\|\Pi_K(x_0+x)-x_0\|^2 - \|\Pi_K(x)\|^2\right| < \infty, \tag{1}$$
or equivalently,
$$\sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \left|\|\Pi_{K - \{x_0\}}(x)\|^2 - \|\Pi_K(x)\|^2\right| < \infty.$$ Note that $\|\Pi_K(x_0+x)-x_0\|^2$ can be rewritten as $\|\Pi_{K - \{x_0\}}(x)\|^2$ where $K-\{x_0\} := \{x-x_0 : x \in K\}$, so my question can be viewed as controlling the difference in the square lengths of the projections onto $K$ and a translated version $K-\{x_0\}$. I do not know if this is true, but have not been able to either prove it or give a counterexample. Note that this is a different statement than
$$\sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \|\Pi_{K-\{x_0\}}(x) - \Pi_K(x)\|^2 < \infty.$$
I do not know if this implies or is implied by the previous claim. I also do not know if this is true or false. They are related as follows:
$$\|\Pi_{K - \{x_0\}}(x)\|^2 - \|\Pi_K(x)\|^2
= \|\Pi_{K-\{x_0\}}(x) - \Pi_K(x)\|^2 + 2\langle\Pi_{K-\{x_0\}}(x)-\Pi_K(x), \Pi_K(x)\rangle.$$ Any references/hints/suggestions are appreciated! Update: although I am not able to parse HK Lee's justification, I believe his/her counterexample is correct. I have verified using a computer that $K=\{(x,y) : y \ge x^2\}$ and $x_0 = (0,1)$ does not satisfy (1) above because the expression tends to $\infty$ for $x=(n,n)$ as $n \to \infty$. (But showing this analytically is messy since one needs to solve a cubic.) My hunch is that the increasing change in curvature is the culprit in the above counterexample, and I conjecture that (1) does hold if $K$ is a polyhedron (finitely many linear constraints). But maybe that is a question for another time.","['convex-geometry', 'convex-analysis', 'geometry']"

Clearly, $y_1$ and $y_2$ are linearly independent functions on $\mathbb R$ and on plugging, both satisfy the given differential equation. Hence, it appears that they are LI solutions of the given ODE, but solving this equation gives $x^2$ and $x^3$ as the two independent solutions and both of them are defined for all $x\in \mathbb R$ (which again contradicts the fact that the Cauchy-Euler equation is defined for $x>0$). Now, my confusion is: $1$. Can a second order ODE have three LI solutions viz. $x^2$, $x^3$ and $x^2|x|$ over $\mathbb R$? $2$. Though the coefficients of $y'$ and $y$ viz. $-4/x$ and $6/x^2$ are not defined at $x=0$ but its solutions are defined there.

Assuming the number of accidents follows a Poisson distribution: What is the probability that there are exactly 8 accidents at that intersection in a week (7 days)?

2164765,"The functional derivative , Fréchet and Gâteaux differentiability of the energy operator","Consider the energy function
$$F(u)=\int_\Omega \frac{1}{2}|\nabla u|^2+fu dx,$$
where $u\in W^{1,2}(\Omega)$, $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $f\in L_2(\Omega)$.
I'd like to find the first order functional derivative of $F$, and determine the Fréchet and Gâteaux differentiability of $F$. Here I present my work so far: The differential $d F$ due to an infinitestimal change $\delta u$ is given by
$$\begin{aligned}d F&=F(u+\delta u)-F(u)=\int_\Omega \frac{1}{2}(|\nabla u+\nabla(\delta u)|^2-|\nabla u|^2)+f\delta ud x\\
&=\int_\Omega\nabla u\cdot\nabla\delta u+f\delta u+\frac{1}{2}|\nabla\delta u|^2d x\\
&=\int_\Omega \nabla\cdot((\nabla u)\delta u)-(\nabla\cdot(\nabla u))\delta u+f\delta u+\frac{1}{2}|\nabla\delta u|^2dx.
\end{aligned}$$
Therefore the first order functional derivative is 
$$\frac{\delta F}{\delta u}=-\nabla\cdot(\nabla u)+f=-\Delta u+f.$$
From the above computation we see that
$$\begin{aligned}\frac{F(u+\epsilon y)-F(u)}{\epsilon}&=\frac{1}{\epsilon}\int_\Omega \frac{1}{2}(\epsilon(\nabla u\cdot\nabla y))+\epsilon fy+\frac{1}{2}\epsilon^2|\nabla y|^2dx\\
&=\int_\Omega \frac{1}{2}(\nabla u\cdot\nabla y)+fy+\frac{1}{2}\epsilon|\nabla y|^d x\\
&\to \int_\Omega \frac{1}{2}(\nabla u\cdot\nabla y)+fydx.
\end{aligned}$$
Hence $F$ is Gâteaux differentiable at $u$, with
$$F'(u)y=\int_\Omega \frac{1}{2}(\nabla u\cdot\nabla y)+fydx.$$ Finally for Fréchet  differentiability, this is the part I am not sure how to proceed. My idea to this is the following: we have
$$F(u+y)-F(u)-L(u)y=\frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega \nabla u\cdot\nabla y+|\nabla y|^2d x=\frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega (\nabla u+\nabla y)\cdot\nabla yd x,$$
where $L$ is the bounded linear functional
$$L(u)y=\int_\Omega fudx.$$
$F$ is Fréchet  differentiable at $u$ if and only if
$$R(u,y):=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega (\nabla u+\nabla y)\cdot\nabla yd x}{\|y\|_{W^{1,2}(\Omega)}}\to 0,\text{ as }y\to 0.$$
When $\nabla u=0$, i.e. when $u=c$ for some constant $c$, we have
$$R(u,y)=\frac{\int_\Omega\|\nabla y|^2dx}{2\|y\|_{W^{1,2}(\Omega)}}\leq\frac{\|y\|_{W^{1,2}(\Omega)}^2}{2\|y\|_{W^{1,2}(\Omega)}}\to 0,\text{ as }y\to 0,$$
 and in this case the Fréchet derivative is given by
$$L(u)y=c\int_\Omega fd x.$$
Then we are left with the case $|\nabla u|\neq 0$. I really didn't have much idea on dealing with this. Any one have some suggestions? Also it will be greatly appreciated if someone can verify my work so far.","['functional-analysis', 'calculus-of-variations', 'sobolev-spaces']"

2164849,Arguing the limit of a function using epsilon delta,"So I have some function f(x,y) where $$f(x,y) = \frac{3xy^2}{x^2+y^4}$$ and I have used other ways to determine that $\lim \limits_{x,y \to 0,0} {f(x,y)}$ might be $0$. So now I want to use the epsilon-delta definition to prove that the limit is $0$. What I have so far is that $\delta > \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} > 0$ and $\epsilon > \frac{3|x|y^2}{x^2+y^4}$. My argument is that because $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ is always positive for $(x,y)$ in the domain of $f(x,y)$ then there exists a $\delta > 0$ for all $\epsilon > 0$ and therefore the limit is $0$. I was wondering if there is a flaw in this logic and if there is how it should be corrected. Thank you.","['multivariable-calculus', 'proof-verification']"
2164875,I've found the fractional-ordered derivative operator,"I've been thinking about it since yesterday and have noticed this pattern: We have, the first order derivative of a function $f(x)$ is:
$$f'(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} .......(1)$$ The second order derivative of the same function is:
$$f''(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x)}{h}$$
By putting $x=x+h$ in (1), we can have $f'(x+h)$.
So,$$f''(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h+h)-f(x+h)}{h}-\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}}{h}$$
Or , $$f''(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+2h)-2f(x+h)+f(x)}{h^2}.....(2)$$
You can check by L'Hospital's rule that this limit evaluates to $f''(x)$.
Now, the third order derivative of the same function is:
$$f'''(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f''(x+h)-f''(x)}{h}$$
By putting $x=x+h$ in (2), we can get $f''(x+h)$. So, $$f'''(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+3h)-2f(x+2h)+f(x+h)}{h^2}-\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+2h)-2f(x+h)+f(x)}{h^2}}{h}$$
which gives $$f'''(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+3h)-3f(x+2h)+3f(x+h)-f(x)}{h^3}......(3)$$
Again, by repeating the same process, we can get that:
$$f''''(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+4h)-4f(x+3h)+6f(x+2h)-4f(x+h)+f(x)}{h^4}....(4)$$
So, we observe that the coefficient of $f(x+(n-r)h)$ in the expression of $f^{n}(x)$ ($n^{th}$ derivative of $f(x)$) is actually $(-1)^{r}\cdot {^n}C_r$, same as the coefficient of $x^{n-r}$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^n$.
It can be proved that:
$$f^n(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\sum_{r=0}^n(-1)^{r}\cdot ^{n}C_r\cdot f(x+(n-r)h)}{h^n}$$
where $f^n(x)$ is the $n^{th}$ order derivative of the function $f(x)$. Now, to generalize this to fractional order derivatives, we just have to generalize the coefficients, which must be similar to the generalization of the expansion of $(x-1)^n$ to fractional exponents. I'm not very good with binomial theorem, but I guess that it should be:
$$f^n(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+nh)-n\cdot f(x+(n-1)h)+\frac{n(n-1)}{2!}\cdot f(x+(n-2)h)-....}{h^n}$$
, where $n$ can be fractional. Have I done anything wrong? UPDATE: A lot of people are saying that my method to get the expressions of $f''(x)$, $f'''(x)$, $f''''(x)$, etc are wrong. I've checked by L'Hospital's rule that the results are correct. Could you please write an answer about getting to these results by using a correct method? UPDATE: On second thoughts, the $n^{th}$ derivative of a function can also proved to be equal to:
$$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+}\frac{\sum_{r=0}^{n}(-1)^r\cdot \binom{n}{r}\cdot f(x-(n-r)h)}{(-h)^n}$$
If we try to expand this to fractions, it can turn out to be imaginary because of the fractional power of $-1$ in the denominator.","['derivatives', 'binomial-theorem', 'binomial-coefficients', 'calculus', 'fractional-calculus']"
2164880,Global Trivializing Sections of Tangent bundle,"I quote from Complex Geometry- An Introduction by Daniel Huybrechts. Let $U\subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$ be an open subset.

A canonical basis of $T_xU$ is given by tangent vectors $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1},\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2},\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n},\frac{\partial}{\partial y_1},\frac{\partial}{\partial y_2},\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial y_n}$$where $z_1=x_1+iy_1,\cdots,z_n=x_n+iy_n$ are the standard coordinates on $\mathbb{C}^n$.

We have $\partial/\partial x_i: U\rightarrow TU$ is given by $p\mapsto (p,\partial/\partial x_i|_p)=(p,\partial/\partial x_i)$ and $\pi\circ \partial/\partial x_i= Id_U$. These sections   almost behaves likes identity maps. Is this the trivialization of sections they are referring to?

$$a^{a^{b}}b^{b^{a}}\geq a^{\frac{a}{b}\cdot b^a}b^{b^{a}}.$$

If not, you can give your argument why is it not right and then proceed in another way.) Also we can show $Y$ is homeomorphic to ""A torus with a small disk removed from it"". Now we know that if $f:Y\rightarrow X$ is a homeomorphism then $f(\partial Y)=\partial X$. Obviously $f|_{\partial Y}$ is continuous.

2165237,How do I know about which point Taylor Polynomial will be expanded?,"I'm going to try asking this question in two different ways, because either may be easier to understand. The first one is more specific, and the second one is more general. Specific Question Let's say that I have a function $f:\mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R} $ , and its taylor polynomial about point $P$ to degree $n$ is $P^f_n$ . Now let's say that I have another function $g: \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ . The domains and such of the functions assures that I can nest: $$z(\vec{x}) = f(g(\vec{x}))$$ given that $\vec{x} \in D(g)$ . If I do the same thing to the taylor polynomials, about which point will the new polynomial be expanded? To clarify, consider: $$P(\vec{x}) = P_n^f(g(\vec{x}))$$ To my knowledge, this nested polynomial is a taylor expansion of $z$ around a point, but if this is true, which one? General Question If I have a composite function $z:\mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ and I want to find its taylor polynomial of degree $n$ around point $\vec{P}$ , how can I accomplish this using the taylor polynomials of the outer function? (And maybe even inner functions, if needed, such as with $z = \sin(\sin(x) + \sin(y))$ .) What are the exact demands that assures me that the result will be around the point $\vec{P}$ , rather than some other point? I'm mainly curious about the demands, because in the past, I've come across cases where not being certain of the demands, leading me to a completely different answer from what I expected. Basically, all I want is to be certain that a nested function is expanded around an asked point, when having the outer- and inner functions' taylor expansions. Complicated example (to visualize) Let's say that I have a slightly complicated function, such as: $$z(x, y) = \sin((x-1)^5(y+2)(x+3)(y-18)^{13})$$ and I want to find its taylor expansion around $(1,-2)$ to a certain degree. I know the taylor expansion for $\sin x$ around $x = 0$ , so one can argue that I can just substitute $(x-1)^5(y+2)(x+3)(y-18)^{13}$ in that formula, giving me the result for the expansion of $z$ around $(1, -2)$ , because: $$(x, y) = (1, -2) \implies (x-1)^5(y+2)(x+3)(y-18)^{13} = 0$$ However, this is a one-way arrow, meaning that there are other points around which it's $0$ . So couldn't you just argue that the obtained expansion, if you use this method, is around point $(-3, 18)$ as well?

2165670,How is it justified in indefinite integral to make trig substitutions whose range is not all real numbers?,"How in indefinite integral we can do the substitution without bothering about the variable or function we are substituting the variable with? For example, it is very common to make trigonometric substitutions for evaluating indefinite integrals like we put x = sint or cosect or cost etc. But how can we do that when we know that the original variable x can assume any real values but the function sint, cost by definition can only asse values in [-1,1] . Now It is okay to make the substitutions x in terms of tan or cot as they can assume all real values. But how is it justified for other trig functions?

2165751,A probability problem on randomly generated graph,"The graph we discuss here is a directed pseudo-graph (two vertices can have multiple edges) with self-loops . The problem is to prove a very intuitively probability formula at the end. The background Given a set of vertices $V$, suppose we know there are $|E|$ edges, and the edges are generated in the following fashion: for the $i$th edge, randomly choose one ${\cal U}_i∈V$ and then randomly choose one ${\cal V}_i∈V$ where ${\cal U}_i,{\cal V}_i$ are random variables and $i=1,…,|E|$. Since it is pseudo-graph with self-loops, then each choice of vertex can be assumed to have no impact on future choices, i.e. all choices of vertices are independent, then the generation of these edges are also independent, and $\mathbb{P}\left( E \right) = \mathbb{P}\left( {{\mathcal{U}_1} = {u_1},{\mathcal{V}_1} = {v_1}, \ldots ,{\mathcal{U}_{\left| E \right|}} = {u_{\left| E \right|}},{\mathcal{V}_{\left| E \right|}} = {v_{\left| E \right|}}} \right) = \mathop \prod \limits_{i = 1}^{\left| E \right|} \mathbb{P}({\mathcal{U}_i} = {u_i})\mathbb{P}({\mathcal{V}_i} = {v_i}) = \mathop \prod \limits_{i = 1}^{\left| E \right|} \mathbb{P}({\mathcal{U}_i} = {u_i},{\mathcal{V}_i} = {v_i}) = {\left( {\frac{1}{{{{\left| V \right|}^2}}}} \right)^{\left| E \right|}} = \frac{1}{{{{\left| V \right|}^{2\left| E \right|}}}}$ Vertex ""Membership"" Now we can assign each vertex a number in $1,...,k$ and thus partition the graph vertices into $k$ disjoint sets, which we can call ""groups"", the number can be named ""membership"" of each vertex. We use a function $z$ to denote the labeling, and $z_v$ is the membership of vertex $v$. Given $z$, we know the number of vertices of each group, denoted by $n_i,i=1,...,k$. Let $n_{i,j}=\mathop \sum \limits_{u,v \in V} {\mathbb{I}_{{z_u} = i,{z_v} = j}}$ where $\Bbb I$ is an identity function using the subscript as the condition, then this is the maximum number of possible ""unique"" edges from group $i$ to group $j$. Suppose a pseudo-graph is generated in the way mentioned above. Now randomly draw an edge $({\cal U},{\cal V})$ from the generated graph. The knowledge of z does not affect $\mathbb{P}\left( {\mathcal{U} = u,\mathcal{V} = v|z} \right)$, i.e. $\mathbb{P}\left( {\mathcal{U} = u,\mathcal{V} = v|z} \right) = \mathbb{P}\left( {\mathcal{U} = u,\mathcal{V} = v} \right)$ then we have $\begin{gathered}
\mathbb{P}\left( {{z_\mathcal{U}} = i,{z_\mathcal{V}} = j{\text{|}}z} \right) = \mathop \sum \limits_{u,v \in V} \mathbb{P}\left( {\mathcal{U} = u,\mathcal{V} = v,{z_u} = i,{z_v} = j{\text{|}}z} \right) \hfill \\

= \mathop \sum \limits_{u,v \in V} \frac{1}{{{{\left| V \right|}^2}}}{\mathbb{I}_{{z_u} = i,{z_v} = j}} = \frac{{{n_{i,j}}}}{{{{\left| V \right|}^2}}} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} $ where $\mathbb{P}\left( {\mathcal{U} = u,\mathcal{V} = v,{z_u} = i,{z_v} = j{\text{|}}z} \right) = \mathbb{P}\left( {\mathcal{U} = u,\mathcal{V} = v|z} \right){\mathbb{I}_{{z_u} = i,{z_v} = j}}$ since $z_u,z_v$ are determined by $z$. My problem Suppose we now can observe the whole generated edge set $E$, and let $e_{i,j}$ be the actual number of edges from group $i$ to group $j$. Still randomly draw an edge $({\cal U},{\cal V})$ from the graph, show $\mathbb{P}\left( {{z_\mathcal{U}} = i,{z_\mathcal{V}} = j{\text{|}}{{z}},E} \right) = \frac{{{e_{i,j}}}}{{\left| E \right|}}$ This is very intuitively true, but I have difficulty showing it rigorously as showing $\mathbb{P}\left( {{z_\mathcal{U}} = i,{z_\mathcal{V}} = j{\text{|}}z} \right) = \frac{{{n_{i,j}}}}{{{{\left| V \right|}^2}}}$ above.

In fact when my professor first gave me this problem, that is very similar to my approach. My question is about a possible alternate solution that I think is a little nicer. This is by no means a formal argument but an outline of what I could make into a formal argument. Since $\mathcal{M}$ is a $\sigma$ -algebra, it is closed under countable unions and complements (and intersections). So it's easy to show that it is also closed under countable symmetric differences. We can then put a ring structure on $\mathcal{M}$ with addition as symmetric difference and multiplication as intersection. We claim that $\mathcal{M}$ is also a boolean ring. The result then follows from the fact that an infinite boolean ring contains infininitely many zero divisors. The main idea here being that if two sets are disjoint, they're zero-divisors in a ring-theoretic sense.

If you can't find the example as above, try to relax the hypothesis slightly more.
Then you can take the following hypothesis. The two curves are convex. But when the curvature is 0, then you can't have a curvature locally 0 around that point.

2166364,Generalization of a common die-rolling game; looking for a limit,"A common interview question (which appears at least once on this board) is the following: You are playing a game in which a single fair 6-sided die is rolled repeatedly, up to a maximum of N rolls. You can stop the process any time you wish, at which point your score is the last value rolled. What is your expected score as a function of N, assuming optimal play? The answer is found recursively: For N=1 the answer is 3.5. For larger N the answer for N-1 determines whether to stop after the first roll, from which we can calculate the answer for N. Now consider just that first roll. Obviously if the first roll is a 6, you stop. Suppose the first roll is 5. Do you stop? The answer depends on N. Clearly for N=2 you stop if 5 is the first roll, and just as clearly you do not stop on an initial 5 if N is very large, because you're so likely to get a 6 eventually. How large must N be so that you will stop on the first roll only if that roll is 6? The answer is 6. That is, if the first roll is 5 you should stop if N<=5 and continue if N>=6. Now generalize to a k-sided die: Let g(k) be the smallest N such that the optimal strategy for a k-sided die is to stop after the first roll only when that roll is k. We've seen that g(6)=6. Is this a coincidence? In fact it is: g(k)=k up to k=9, but g(10) = 11. So consider the ratio g(k)/k. As k increases, this ratio increases (though not monotonically). Numeric calculation suggests that it approaches a limit, and that limit might be e/2.

I did this because it now looks like a laplace type of integral. The problem that I see and I think I cannot do much with this form is because for Laplace type of integrals we need $x \rightarrow \infty$ and sadly we do not have that. So I think this is some clever by parts, but I cannot see it.

$$\int \sqrt{x^2+1}dx$$
on a problem list and I think it is a sneaky way of hiding a $\int \sec^3xdx$ problem but I am not sure if what I did was correct though, because of what happens at the end. So what I did was use trig-substitution and let $u=\tan\theta$ and $du=\sec^2\theta d\theta$
$$\int \sqrt{x^2+1}dx=\int\sqrt{\tan^2\theta+1}\sec^2\theta d\theta=\int \sec^3\theta d\theta$$
$$= \int (\tan^2\theta+1)\sec\theta d\theta = \int \tan^2\theta \sec\theta +\int \sec\theta d\theta$$
I will label $I_s=\int \sec\theta d\theta = \ln|\sec\theta+\tan\theta|$ so I have
$$\int \sec^3xdx=\int\tan^2x\sec x dx+I_s$$
and use integration by parts to solve $\int tan^2\theta \sec\theta d\theta$ that remains. I let $u=\sec\theta$ so $du=\sec\theta\tan\theta d\theta$ and $dv=\tan^2\theta\, d\theta$ such that $v=\tan\theta -\theta$
$$\int\tan^2x\sec x dx =\sec\theta (\tan\theta -\theta) - \int (\tan\theta-\theta)\sec\theta\tan\theta d\theta$$
$$= \frac 12 \sec\theta (\tan\theta -\theta) + \frac 12\int \theta \sec\theta\tan\theta \, d\theta$$
Again I use integration by parts, this time on $\frac 12\int \theta \sec\theta\tan\theta \, d\theta$ and let $u=\theta$ so $du=d\theta$ and $dv=\sec\theta\tan\theta \,d\theta$ so $v=\sec\theta$
$$\frac 12\int \theta \sec\theta\tan\theta \, d\theta = \frac 12 \theta \sec\theta - \frac 12 I_s$$
$$= \frac 12(\theta\sec\theta - I_s)$$
and use this result to get
$$\int\tan^2x\sec x dx = \frac 12 \sec\theta (\tan\theta -\theta) + \frac 12(\theta\sec\theta - I_s)$$
$$= \frac 12 \sec\theta\tan\theta - \frac 12 I_s$$
Putting everything back together and including an arbitrary constant $C$ i get
$$\int \sec^3\theta\,d\theta = \int \tan^2\theta\sec\theta d\theta + I_s$$
$$= \frac 12 \sec\theta\tan\theta - \frac 12 I_s + I_s + C$$
$$=\frac 12\sec\theta\tan\theta +\frac 12 \ln|\sec\theta+\tan\theta|+C$$
and substituting back into $x$-variable terms using $\tan\theta = x$ I have $\sec\theta = \sqrt{x^2+1}$ so 
$$\int \sqrt{x^2+1}dx =\frac 12x\sqrt{x^2+1} +\frac 12 \ln|\sqrt{x^2+1}+x|+C$$
The reason why I am not sure about this is because when substituting back I have $\sec\theta = \sqrt{x^2+1}$ which is the same as the integrand $\sqrt{x^2+1}$ that became $\sec^3\theta$ in the initial substitutions.

2166544,Computing homology from a Heegaard Splitting,"I've recently begun thinking a little about Heegaard splittings and Heegaard diagrams for closed orientable 3 manifolds. I'd like to understand: Given a Heegaard diagram for $Y$, can one 'read off' $H_{1}(Y)$ and $H_{2}(Y)$? Ideally, 'read off' would mean something like apply an algorithm to a Heegaard diagram $(\Sigma, \{\alpha_{i}\}, \{\beta_{i}\})$ which describes the groups via generators and relations phrased in terms of the $\alpha_{i}$ and $\beta_{i}$. Applying Mayer-Vietoris to the Heegaard decomposition $Y= M_{1} \cup_{\Sigma}M_{2}$, one finds it is sufficient to understand the map $(i_{1},i_{2})_{*} : H_{1}(\Sigma) \rightarrow H_{1}(M_{1}) \oplus H_{1}(M_{2})$ induced by the inclusions, as $H_{1}(Y) \cong coker((i_{1},i_{2})_{*})$ and $H_{2}(Y) \cong ker((i_{1},i_{2})_{*})$. If I assume the $\alpha_{i}$ are chosen ""nicely"", I've been able to write down a matrix presenting this map. In the general case, I believe I can do the same so long as the following claim is true: Given a Heegaard diagram $(\Sigma, \{\alpha_{i}\}, \{\beta_{i}\})$, there exist curves $\{a_{i}\}$ and $\{b_{i}\}$ in $\Sigma$ such that $a_{i} \cap \alpha_{j} = \{pt\} \delta_{ij}$, $b_{i} \cap \beta_{j} = \{pt\} \delta_{ij}$,  and $\{a_{i}, b_{i}\}$ generate $H_{1}(\Sigma)$. In all examples I've considered, it's easy to do this. Need this be true? Or is there an easy way to use M.V. to answer the original question? Edit: I have seen this post, and now understand the presentation given for $H_{1}(Y)$, which is very nice. I'd still like to understand how to write this down directly from M.V., since that seems to me like a natural method of attack.","['algebraic-topology', 'geometric-topology', 'general-topology', 'low-dimensional-topology']"

2167297,Is the unit circle the only infinite compact subgroup of the multiplicative group of non-zero complex numbers?,"Let $G$ be an infinite subgroup of $(\mathbb C \setminus \{0\},.)$ such that $G$ is compact as a subset of $\mathbb C$ , then is it true that $G=S^1$ ? I know that $G \subseteq S^1$ ; and since any closed subset of $S^1$ is compact in complex plane , so basically I am asking whether any infinite subgroup of $S^1$ which is closed in the complex plane , must necessarily be $S^1$ .","['infinite-groups', 'compactness', 'group-theory', 'analysis']"
