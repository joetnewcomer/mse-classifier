128208,A simple application of Hölders inequality (I think),"I'm reading a paper where the following inequality appears.
$$
\| \widehat{f} \|^2_{L^2(d\mu)} \leq \| f \ast \widehat{\mu} \|_p \| f \|_{p^\prime}
$$
where $f$ is a real-valued measurable function on $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mu$ is a positive measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{p^{\prime}} = 1$.  I think $\| \cdot \|_p$ and $\| \cdot \|_{p^{\prime}}$ are with respect to Lebesgue measure. $$
\widehat{\mu}(\xi) = \int e^{-2 \pi i x \xi} d\mu(x)

128225,"Determining the ""positivity"" or ""negativity"" of Chern class (number?) of zero-sets of homogeneous polynomials","If $\Omega$ is the curvature 2-form on a $n-$manifold, then I would think that the Chern classes (forms), $c_k$ are defined as, $det(I + \frac{it\Omega}{2\pi}) = \sum c_k t^k$ I would like to know of a local coordinate expression for the above so that I can clearly see as to how each $c_k$ on the RHS turns out to be a rank $2k$ form. (..naively it seems that one has to think of the determinant on the LHS to be that of a ""matrix"" each of whose entries are 2-forms themselves and the probably the ""multiplication"" that is being done among the elements of the matrix to evaluate the determinant is taking a wedge product -- but I would like to know of something explicit..)

Is there an invariant meaning to may be the integral over the manifold of that form? One particular case which I am interested in is this, Consider the zero-set in $\mathbb{CP}^n$ of a homogeneous degree $k$ polynomial in $n$ variables. Firstly when is it guaranteed that this is going to be a manifold? Now how does one understand that the ""sign"" of the Chern class (whetever that means) depends on whether $k> n$ or $k<n$?

This gives a topology indeed (right?). I think that in finite-dimensional vector spaces, this gives the standard topology (right?). What about infinite-dimensional vector spaces? Is there a name for this topology? To me, this looks like a very generic way to define a topology on a vector space, but I've never seen this definition of a topology.

128357,sum of arctangent,"Here is an interesting topic.  It comes from evaluating $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{k^{2}}\right)$$ I managed to dig up an old paper I have on the sum of arctans by Boros and Moll.  It is called the Method of Zeros.  It is located here: http://www.mat.utfsm.cl/scientia/archivos/vol11/Art2.pdf on page 6-7 I will post, verbatim, what it says.  Perhaps someone can figure out how they arrive at the solution. They skip over the details and I do not know how they arrived at the general form they establish in [2]. ""Based on the factorization of the product $$p_{n}:=\prod_{k=1}^{n}(a_{k}+ib_{k}), \;\ a_{k},b_{k}\in R$$ The argument of $p_{n}$ is given by $$\text{arg}(p_{n})=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b_{k}}{a_{k}}\right)$$ up to an integral multiple of $\pi$ . This can be applied to the case of a polynomial with real coefficients given by $$p_{n}(z)=\prod_{k=1}^{n}(z-z_{k})$$ Then, $$\text{arg}(p_{n}(z))=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x-x_{k}}{y-y_{k}}\right)$$ up to an integral multiple of $\pi$ . The special case $$p_{n}(z)=z^{n}-1$$ has roots at $$z_{k}=\cos(\frac{2\pi k}{n})+i\sin\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right),$$ so we get: $$\text{arg}(z^{n}-1)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x-\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)}{y-\sin\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)}\right)$$ The classical factorization $$\sin(\pi z)=\pi z\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(1-\frac{z^{2}}{k^{2}}\right) \tag{1}$$ shows that one can think of $\sin(\pi z)$ as a polynomial in $z$ of infinite degree. Euler than derived $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{2}}=\frac{{\pi}^{2}}{6}$$ by comparing the cubic terms of (1). This now yields $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2xy}{k^{2}-x^{2}+y^{2}}\right)=\tan^{-1}(y/x)-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\tanh(\pi y)}{\tan(\pi x)}\right) \tag{2}$$ That is it. They mention Euler's famous sum of reciprocal of squares then just skip to ""this then yields...."" Does anyone see how? Besides that, didn't Euler compare the square terms and not the cubic ones? So, for the problem at hand, we would let $x=y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ and arrive at: $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{k^{2}}\right)=\frac{\pi}{4}-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\tanh\left(\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}{\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}\right)\approx 1.42474......$$",['sequences-and-series']

I just cannot intuitively make sense of this. Where does that fact that they are standard normal Gaussian come into play?

128388,$\ell_\infty$ is a Grothendieck space,"The problem I am considering stated formally is this: Show that if a sequence in $\ell_\infty^*$ is weak*-convergent, then it is also weakly convergent.
We may reduce this to the case where the sequence is weak$^*$-null, and show that it is weakly null. This is a special case of a result of Grothendieck from the 50's.  It is an internal characterization of what is now called a Grothendieck space. A Banach space $X$ is Grothendieck if every weak$^*$-convergent sequence in $X^*$ is weakly convergent. In his ""resume,"" Grothendieck proves that $C(K)$ for $K$ an extremally disconnected (also called Stonian) compact space satisfies this property.  Since we can represent $\ell_\infty$ as $C(\beta\mathbb{N})$, the space of continuous functions on the Stone-Cech compactification of the natural numbers (which is Stonian), it satisfies this property. So my questions are 1) If you know the general technique to show this property for $C(K)$ spaces as mentioned above could you give me a brief indication, and also 2) Is there something in this particular example that might make it easier to deal with than general $C(K)$? Either way I assume we have to be able to either work blindly with elements of $\ell_\infty^{**}$ since we can't well characterize it, or there may be some other way to show weak convergence.

128656,High school math definition of a variable: the first step from the concrete into the abstract...,"variable : A symbol used to represent one or more numbers. Or alternatively:  A symbol used to represent any member of a given set. High school students are justifiably confused by the two distinct concepts: a variable as something that “varies” in an
expression, such as the h in the expression $4.50\cdot h$ ;
and an unknown quantity that is a ""specific unknown” in an
equation The definition of a variable as being a symbol used to
represent both of these cases explicitly states this
as: “a symbol used to represent one or more numbers.”
Where the “one number” case is the “specific unknown” in a simple
equation, such as $18.00=4.50\cdot h\;$ where the $h$ can only
represent the one number $4$ to turn the open sentence into
a true statement. The more than one number case being the letter h standing
for values in a table such as: $1, 2, 3,\>$ or $4$ being
substituted into an equation to form a pattern such as $C=4.50\cdot h$ , the definition of a variable now being
interpreted as a symbol, h, used to represent one number
when that number is substituted in for it and a symbol
used to represent more than one number when other numbers
are substituted in for it. Thus generating a table of
values of $C$ such as: $4.50, 9.00, 13.50,\>$ and $18.00$ . Another example, the variable, say x, in the quadratic equation represents a parabola when it ""varies"" over a given domain. But the variable in the equation $0=x^2+2x+1$ is ""an unknown quantity. It does not vary."" Thus, in this case the vari-able has lost its ability to ""vary."" Yet in both situations they are referred to as a variable, and this duality is embodied in the definition of a variable as ""a symbol used to represent one or more numbers."" Could the motivation behind this definition be such that we don't have to make the distinction between an ""unknown specific quantity"" and a ""varying"" quantity?

is there some flaw in my reasoning? Thank you. a symbol used to represent one or more numbers See here","['education', 'algebra-precalculus']"

As a special case we can get subspaces that are the closure of the linear span of disjointly supported vectors. These subspaces give us examples of norm one projections.

128861,Extending Tensor Fields defined on Manifolds to Ambient Space,"I am currently reading about tensor fields on manifolds, and I came across two comments that sound contradictory to me. The first comment is made in the book by James Munkres ""Analysis on Manifolds"", page 249: Any tensor field on M [M a manifold and a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$] can be extended to a tensor field defined on an open set of $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing $M$. The second comment is made in the book by John Lee ""Riemannian Manifolds, An Introduction to Curvature"", page 56: Not every vector field along a curve [in a manifold M] need be extendible [to a neighborhood of the curve in M]. As an example, Lee mentions the case of a vector field of an intersecting curve. Now - the notion of a tensor is quite new to me so I might go wrong here but I thought a vector field is a contravariant tensor field of rank 1. But if that is the case then the above comments contradict each other... a clarification of where I went wrong in my reasoning would be a great help, many thanks!","['tensors', 'riemannian-geometry', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

128918,cusp and node are not isomorphic,"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $\neq 2$ and consider the affine varieties $X_1 := V(x^2-y^3)$ (the cusp) and $X_2 = V(y^2-x^2 (x+1))$ (the node). I would like to show that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are not isomorphic. This is easy if one knows some basic cohomology or singularity theory; but this exercise appears in an introductory script to AG where only absolute basics about affine varieties have been established. Thus, I'm looking for an elementary proof. But of course I would like to avoid any fiddly computation with polynomials (please don't post these as an answer). Here is what I've done: There are bijective morphisms $\mathbb{A}^1 \to X_1, t \mapsto (t^3,t^2)$ and $\mathbb{A}^1 \to X_2, t \mapsto (t^2-1,t(t^2-1))$. They induce isomorphisms $\mathbb{A}^1 - \{0\} \cong X_1 - \{(0,0)\}$ (the inverse takes $(x,y) \mapsto x/y$) and $\mathbb{A}^1 - \{\pm 1\} \cong X_2 - \{(0,0)\}$ (the inverse takes $(x,y) \mapsto y/x$). Now any isomorphism $X_1 \cong X_2$ must preserve the origin. The reason is that it is the unique singular point (which can be formulated elementarily, see here ). Thus, it would yield an isomorphism $\mathbb{A}^1 - \{0\} \cong \mathbb{A}^1 - \{\pm 1\}$. On coordinate rings, this is an isomorphism $k[t]_t \cong k[t]_{t^2-1}$ of $k$-algebras. It induces an isomorphism on the groups of units $k^* \cdot \langle t \rangle \cong k^* \cdot \langle t+1,t-1 \rangle$, preserving $k^*$, thus an isomorphism of groups $\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$, contradiction!

129010,Why is an analytic variety irreducible provided that the set of its smooth points is connected?,"Here is a proposition from Griffith and Harris, Principles of Algebraic Geometry . Let $V$ be an analytic variety on a complex manifold $M$, let $V^*$ be its points of smooth points. If $V^*$ is connected, then $V$ is irreducible. The proof in the book is very short. It goes like this: Suppose $V=V_1\cup V_2$ is a decomposition of $V$. Then $V_1\cap V_2$ is
contained in the set of singularities of $V$. Hence $V^*$ can not be
connected. I cannot figure out why $V$ must be singular at the intersection of $V_1$
and $V_2$. This is wrong when the $V_i$'s are allowed to be reducible. For
example, $V$ consists of three lines on the plane, $V_1$ is the first two
lines and $V_2$ is the last two. But in this case the choice of $V_i$'s
has some kind of redundancy. To make it simple, let's assume that it has precisely two irreducible components 
and try to derive a contradiction. I am already convinced that, in your notation, $V\cap U$ is irreducible when
$V\cap U$ is smooth. What I am afraid of is a picture like this:  for example, $V_1$ is the line $y=0$ on 
the plane and $V_2$ looks like the graph of a bump function. I know this would never happen, 
because analytic varieties are ""rigid"". But I don't know how to exclude this possibility. Can anybody give me a hand? Thanks!","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'complex-analysis']"
129011,Does similarity of integer matrices with square $-I$ imply the transition matrix is an integer matrix?,"I'm working on a homework question, and I'm stuck.

The first part of the question asks to show that $A$ and $B$ are similar, and that the transition matrix is rational. I believe I've done that. However it's this second part that has me stumped: Suppose $A$ and $B$ have integer coefficients. Can we assume that $C$ and $C^{-1}$ ($C$ is the transition matrix) have integer coefficients as well? The hint given was to convert $\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$ into a $\mathbb{Z}[x]$-module. While I'm sure there are other methods to doing this, I'm interested in following the direction of the hint, it seems like an interesting method, and I would like to get better at using module theory as a practical tool. What I've Done So Far: So for starters, in order to make $\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$ into a $\mathbb{Z}[x]$-module, we need a linear map. But it seems like there is a very natural choice in this case, namely, the map $T$ underlying the similar matrices $A$ and $B$. However, I'm not sure where to go from here.

129065,"What is the module $\operatorname{Hom}(M,N)$ where $R=\mathbb{C}[x]$ and $M=R/(x)$ and $N=R/(x-1)$.","Here is what I have so far: Consider $\mathbb{C}[x]/(x)$. This ring is all complex coefficient polynomials in $x$, and when quotient by the ideal $(x)$, we are subsituting $0$ for every $x$ in the polynomial, which kills all terms except the zero degree term, thus $\mathbb{C}[x]/(x) \cong \mathbb{C}$. Similarly, when we quotient by the ideal $(x-1)$ we set every $x$ in the polynomial to $1$, and we again have that $\mathbb{C}/(x-1) \cong \mathbb{C}$. Call the module $\mathbb{C}[x]/(x)=M$ and the other $N$. The difference between modules $M$ and $N$ is in the multiplication by the ring $\mathbb{C}[x]=R$. Let $p(x)\in R$ and let $m\in M$ and $n\in N$. $p(x)\cdot m=p(0)m$ while $p(x)\cdot n=p(1)n$. Thus even thought $M$ and $N$ are equivalent set wise they behave differently as modules over the same ring $R$. A homomorphism $\phi \in \operatorname{Hom}(M,N)$ must satisfy for all $m, m' \in M$ and $p, q \in R$, $\phi(p(x)m+q(x)m')=p(x)\phi(m)+q(x)\phi(m')$ Consider the $(1-x)\in R$, we know that $\phi$ is determined by where it send 1, since for any $c\in\mathbb{C}$, $\phi(c)=\phi(1c)=c\phi(1)$ since $\phi$ is homomorphism over $R$. We see that $\phi(1)=\phi((1-0)1)=\phi((1-x)1)=(1-x)\phi(1)=(1-1)\phi(1)=0\phi(1)=0$. Thus there is only the trivial homomorphism and $\operatorname{Hom}(M,N)$ is the zero module. Is this correct? Also,is it usually the case that for a given ring $R$ and two distinct non-unit elements $r, r' \in R$ the module of homomorphisms from the module $R/(r)$ to $R/(r')$ is isomorphic to $R/(\gcd(r,r'))$.

Since my French is not very good, I misread the Galois's original paper.
So let me explain my question again. Let $f(X)$ be an irreducible polynomial over a field $K$ of characteristic $0$. Let $L$ be a splitting field of $f(X)$ over $K$. Let $G$ be the Galois group of $L/K$. Let $S$ be the set of all roots of $f(X)$ in $L$. Suppose $G$ is solvable and it acts primitively on $S$. It is well-known that the degree of $f(X)$ is a prime power $p^k$. Let $a, b$ be distinct elements of $S$. Galois wrote that the pointwise stabilizer of $\{a, b\}$ is $1$ except the following cases. $p^k = 9, 25$ $p^k = 4$ $k > 1$ and let $(p^k - 1)/(p - 1)$ be $M$.
There is a prime power divisor $q^r$ of $M$ such that $(M/q^r)k = p \pmod q^r$ He wrote something about the pointwise stabilizer of $\{a, b\}$ in this case, but I cannot understand it fully. He wrote (I changed a bit of notations): il faudra toujours que deux des racines etant connues, les autres s'en deduisent, du moins au moyen d'un nombre de radicaux, du degre $p$, egal au nombre des diviseurs $q^r$ de $M$ qui sont tels que $(M/q^r)k = p \pmod q^r$, $q$ premier. It seems to me that he meant the pointwise stabilizer of $\{a, b\}$ is of order $p^s$
and $s$ is the number of prime power divisors $q^r$ which satisfies the above condition. Are these correct?
Could someone please explain these to me?",['group-theory']
