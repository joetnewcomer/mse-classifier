135425,Compact multiplication operators,"In class, we started talking about operators on Banach spaces after covering the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem. We defined a continuous operator $T\colon X \to Y$ to be compact if $\overline{T(B_X)}^{Y}$ is compact, where $B_X$ is the unit ball in $X$. Consider the Hilbert space $\ell_2 = \{ |x_n|^2 : \sum |x_n|^2 < \infty \}$. Given a bounded sequence $(a_n)^{\infty}_{n=1}$, define a linear operator $A\colon \ell_2 \to\ell_2$ by $A((x_n)) = (a_nx_n)$. With the above definition, how can I show that the operator $A$ is compact if and only if $\lim a_n = 0$? Do I need an equivalent definition of compactness, or can it be done using the above definition?","['operator-theory', 'compact-operators', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"

135451,Newton polygons,"This question is primarily to clear up some confusion I have about Newton polygons. Consider the polynomial $x^4 + 5x^2 +25 \in \mathbb{Q}_{5}[x]$. I have to decide if this polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}_{5}$. So, I compute its Newton polygon. On doing this I find that the vertices of the polygon are $(0,2)$, $(2,1)$ and $(4,0)$. The segments joining $(0,2)$ and $(2,1)$, and $(2,1)$ and $(4,0)$ both have slope $-\frac{1}{2}$, and both segments have length $2$ when we take their projections onto the horizontal axis. Am I correct in concluding that the polynomial $x^4 +5x^2 +25$ factors into two quadratic polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}_{5}$, and so is not irreducible? I am deducing this on the basis of the following definition of a pure polynomial given in Gouvea's P-adic Numbers, An Introduction (and the fact that irreducible polynomials are pure): A polynomial is pure if its Newton polygon has one slope. What I interpret this definition to mean is that a polynomial $f(x) = a_nx^n + ... + a_0$ $\in \mathbb{Q}_{p}[x]$ (with $a_na_0 \neq 0$) is pure, iff the only vertices on its Newton polygon are $(0,v_p(a_0))$ and $(n, v_p(a_n))$. Am I right about this, or does the polynomial $x^4 + 5x^2+25$ also qualify as a pure polynomial?","['algebraic-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'p-adic-number-theory']"

Show that for any $w$ in $\mathbb{C}$ there is a sequence $\{z_n\}$ in $G$ with $a=\lim z_n$ and $w=\lim f(z)$. The conclusion makes me want to apply the Casorati-Weirstrass theorem.

135461,"Change of coordinate codomain from $[-1,1]$ to $[0,1]$","How does one translate coordinates from $[-1,1]$ to $[0,1]$? That is, suppose we have an ordered pair $(x,y)$ which lies between $[-1,1]$ and want to push into the range delimited by $[0,1]$. A lot of places does the transformation something like this: $$f(u) = ((u_1 + 1)/2)i + ((u_2 +1)/2)j$$ I'm not even sure if I may express it this way (?), here's the usual expression: $$x = (c_x + 1) / 2$$
$$y = (c_y + 1) / 2$$ I can see that that the addition of $1$ will force all the possible inputs into the $[0,2]$ range and that the division by the maximum of the range will force it to be expressed as a part of the whole, the whole being the dimensionless $1$, effectively expressing all values in the range of $[0,1]$.

A set is said to be convex when $sx + (1 - s)y \in M$, where $x, y \in M$ and $s \in (0,1)$ I've read on wikipedia that this can be proven over the triangle inequality, but I think it can be solved in another way? Would this be enough as proof: For the unit sphere, we have to prove that $0 \leq sx + (1 - s)y \leq 1$ (because $||x||\leq 1$ therefore, $0 \leq x,y \leq 1$). Seeing as the maximal value that x and y can take are 1, the maximum the equation can achieve is 1 (when s=1,x=1 or s=0,y=1).

135510,How is Leibniz's rule for the derivative of a product related to the binomial formula? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Closed 12 years ago . Possible Duplicate: “Binomial theorem”-like identities The binomial formula describes the expansion of the $n$th power of the sum $(a+b)$: $$(a+b)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n {n\choose k}a^kb^{n-k}$$ In calculus, there is a generalization of the product rule called Leibniz's rule , which describes the expansion of the $n$th derivative of the product of two functions $f$ and $g$: $$(fg)^{(n)} = \sum_{k = 0}^n {n\choose k}f^{(k)}g^{(n-k)}$$ It's not difficult to prove using the product rule and induction, what I'm really trying understand here is why the formula is true. Is there a way to prove it using the binomial formula? How are these two formulas related? Is there a combinatorial proof for Leibniz's rule like there is for the binomial formula ?

135534,An equation that occurs in ecology,"In the field of ecology, a well known relation between the number of species and the size of an island can be approximated by a power function of the form:

I’ve never encountered a multivariate equation where one of the independent variables consists of the slope of a linear relation where a non-linear transform has been applied to the major independent and dependent variable.

135540,Question concerning a possible constant sum of squares in a circle,"Assume a circle, of some radius $r$ say $r=1$. Consider a fixed $n$, say $n=30$, of points on the circumference of the circle. That $n$ points $(x_k,y_k)_{k=1,\ldots, n}$ define a mean in the interior of the circle, call this point m $(x_m,y_m) $.
Now we compute the ""circular variance"" , just the mean-of-squares of the distances
$$ \mathrm{msq}=\frac1n\sum_{k=1}^n ((x_k-x_m)^2+(y_k-y_m)^2) $$ Now we assume another set of $n$ points $(x'_k,y'_k)_{k=1,\ldots, n}$, which are selected such that they have the same mean. Is the circular variance the same  $\mathrm{msq}'=\mathrm{msq} $ ? I've seen, that the two extreme situations where the $n$ points are accumulated at the green positions in the graph and where they are accumulated at the magenta positions in the graph( (where the fat red point indicates the mean)) , the msq-values are identical. I could try to program a routine to test the question approximately by brute force, but perhaps there is an analytic argument? [update]: Michael Hardy's anwer solves this neatly. I find it a very nice observation, that that ""circular variance"" depends only on the mean of the points and is thus constant for all resulting means which lie on the same circle inside the original circle. So with the mean laying on the inner circle with radius $\small r_m$ we get $$\small \operatorname{msq}=1-r_m^2$$
 Possibly worth an entry in the wikipedia? (in some ""special points/geometric relations of a circle"" - section , don't know the actual name for the existing collection) Btw, does this allow also a generalization to a continuous formulation instead of ""n discrete points"", say via integrals?","['statistics', 'geometry']"

Hint it Willard's book suggest to show that if $X$ Hausdorff and not H-closed, then it is not minimal. I've tried to use the characterization of H-closed spaces using filters. Which means that there is an open filter in $X$ which has no cluster point.

Now this is true when $M$ is a compact connected topological manifold of dimension $n \geq 2$. Here is why. Since $n \geq 2$, $M \backslash \{m\}$ is a connected manifold whose one point compactification is $M$. By topological homogeneity, there exists a homeomorphism $f : M \backslash \{m\} \to M \backslash \{m\}$ which maps $p$ to $q$. $f$ is a proper map, therefore it lifts to an automorphism $M \to M$ of the 1 point compactification which maps infinity to infinity, i.e it maps $m$ to $m$. It is also true for $\mathbb{R}$. A dilation centered at $m$ does the trick. is the above boxed statement true for other non compact manifolds?","['general-topology', 'manifolds']"

So we have a generalization of $(1)$. The question is whether we can generalize the identity below using the same idea $$\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i}^2 = \binom{2n}{n} \; \forall n \in \mathbb{Z^+} \tag 4$$ which means to find $f$ in $$\sum_{a_1,...,a_k \in \mathbb{N}; \; a_1+...+a_k=n} \left ( \frac{n!}{a_1!...a_k!} \right )^2 = f(n,k) \; \forall n,k \in \mathbb{Z^+} \tag 5$$ That is the problem I try to solve few days now but not achieve anything.

by using Double Counting: We double-count the number of ways to choose a sex-equal subgroup, half of which are on the special duty, from the group which includes $n$ men and $n$ women (the empty subgroup is counted). The first way of counting: The number of satisfying subgroups which contain $2i$ people is $\binom{n}{i}^2 \binom{2i}{i}$. So we have the number of satisfying subgroups is $RHS(6)$. The second way of counting: The number of satisfying subgroups which contain $2(a_2+a_3)$ people, $a_2$ women on the duty and $a_3$ men on the duty is
$$\left ( \frac{n!}{a_1!a_2!a_3!} \right )^2$$.

Is $\alpha$ require to be unique as well? On one hand, I feel that the requirement of $\alpha$ to be unique is kind of unnatural.  When we consider $M$ as a representable functor from the category of schemes to that of sets, it is natural to send a base $B$ to the isomorphic class of families.  On the other hand, here is a proof from nlab that shows the $j$-line is not a fine moduli space. I don't see where the contradictions arises if $\alpha$ is not required to be unique.

Part of our answer is that if $C_1$ is straight from $-1$ to $1$ (or deformable into such a line), then the integral must equal $\arctan(1)-\arctan(-1)=\frac \pi 2$. Note that $C_1$ passes between the two singularities. Why doesn't thm 5.19 apply to a curve which passes over (or under), both singularities (and doesn't loop either)? If $C_2$ passes over both singularities, then it is piecewise smooth. $F$ is still defined on an open set containing $C_2$ (it's not an open disc , and it would have to be drawn carefully so as not to include either singularity, but it is open). And $F'(z)$ still exists and is continuous on the curve.

In a tank are $100$ gallons of brine containing $50$ pounds of dissolved salt.  Water runs into the tank at the rate of $3$ gallons per minute, and the concentration is kept uniform by stirring.  How much salt is in the tank at the end of one hour if the mixture runs out at a rate of $2$ gallons per minute? #10.  Refer to Exercise 9.  Suppose the bottom of the tank is covered with a mixture of salt and insoluble material.  Assume that the salt dissolves at a rate proportional to the difference between the concentration of the solution and that of a saturated solution (3 pounds of salt per gallon), and that if the water were fresh 1 pound of salt would dissolve per minute.  How much salt will be in solution at the end of one hour? First, I define $y = f(t) =$ number of pounds of salt in solution at time $t$.  To write an equation for $y'$ we want to determine the amount of salt being added by the dissolving substance and the amount being removed by the solution running off.  The amount added by the dissolving substance is given by $$ k \left(3 - \dfrac{f(t)}{100+t}\right)$$ Since we are told that the rate is proportional to the difference between $3$ pounds of salt per gallon and the current concentration of salt.  Further, we are told that if the concentration of salt is $0$ then the rate is $1$ pound per minute; hence, $3k = 1 \implies k = \frac{1}{3}$. Then, from #9 we have the rate at which salt is exiting the solution given by $$-2 \left(\dfrac{f(t)}{100+t}\right)$$ Putting this together we have $$y' = -2\left(\dfrac{f(t)}{100+t}\right) + 1 - \dfrac{f(t)}{3(100+t)}$$ Thus, giving us the first-order linear differential equation: $$y' + \dfrac{7}{3(100+t)}y = 1$$ From this we have the unique solution $y = f(t)$ with $f(0) = 50$ given by $$\begin{align*}
y &= 50 \dfrac{100^{7/3}}{(100+t)^{7/3}} + \dfrac{1}{(100+t)^{7/3}} \int_0^t (100+x)^{7/3} dx\\
&= 50 \dfrac{100^{7/3}}{(100+t)^{7/3}} + \dfrac{3t}{10}\\
\implies f(60) &= 34.7 \text{ pounds of salt}

136157,Dot product of two vectors without a common origin,"Given two unit vectors $v_1, v_2\in R^n$, their dot product is defined as $v_1^Tv_2=\|v_1\|\cdot\|v_2\|\cdot\cos(\alpha)=\cos(\alpha)$. Now, suppose the vectors are in a relation $v_2=v_1+a\cdot1_n$, i.e., the vectors are parallel (one is the shifted version of another), where $a\in \mathbb{R}$ is a constant and $1_n=[1 \dots 1]\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector of all ones.  Dot product would now be $$v_1^Tv_2=v_1^T(v_1+a\cdot1_n)=1+a\cdot v_1^T1_n \tag 1.$$
This implies that by shifting the vectors, the dot product changes, but still $v_1v_2=\cos(\alpha)$, where the angle now has no meaning. Does that imply that, to perform the proper angle check between two vectors one has to center them (average of vector entries is zero for both vectors, which would be one option)?
If so, what does this imply geometrically? Are vectors brought to the same origin this way? Another, more interesting observation is with $v_1, v_2$ being unit eigenvectors of two diffrent matrices. From (1), it can be concluded that when the vector entry sum is zero (vectors are centered), the origin is shared (?). For which matrices is it the case that the eigenvectors are centered, ie., with the eigenvector entry sum of zero? For instance, with the matrices having $1_n$ as an eigenvector, by virtue of orthogonality, the sum of entries for each other eigenvector is 0.

Secondly, assume that $a=c^p-c$ for some $c\in F$. Then we have that $$x^p-x-a=x^p-x-(c^p-c)=x^p-c^p-x+c=(x-c)^p-(x-c)=(x-c)((x-c)^{p-1}-1)$$Hence $f(x)$ is reducible.
