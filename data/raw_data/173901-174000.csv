3101672,Let $A$ be a set that is countable. Let there be a function mapping $A$ onto a set $B$. Is $B$ countable? [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Suppose that A is a countable set. Show that the set B is also countable if there is an onto function f from A to B. (1 answer) Closed 5 years ago . Let $A$ be a set that is countable. Let there be a function mapping $A$ onto a set $B$ . I'm asked to prove the statement "" $B$ is countable"". This is my attempt at a solution. Since $A$ is countable it is either finite or countable infinite. 
If it is finite the statement is obvious. If it is countably infinite, it is by definition in one-to-one correspondence with the set $N$ consisting of positive integers. Since there exists a function mapping $A$ onto $B$ , every element in $B$ has a direct relation to atleast one element in $A$ , which in turn has a relation to $N$ . And thus it $B$ must be countable since by proxy it is in one-to-one correspondence with $N$ . Does this logic prove anything, am I missing something? Am I completely on the wrong track and if so, how would I go about proving it? What happens in extreme cases if every element in $B$ is the image of a lot of elements in $A$ ?",['elementary-set-theory']

3101694,"Is there a ""greatest function"" that converges?","We just hit convergence tests in calculus, and learned that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}$ converges for all $p \gt 1$ . I thought that this was sort of a ""barrier"" between what converges and what diverges. Specifically, that setting $a_n=\frac{1}{n^{1+\epsilon}}$ is sort of the ""greatest function"" (I'll make this precise later) for which $\sum a_n$ converges. But, I did realize that there are functions that dominate $\frac{1}{n^{1+\epsilon}}$ but not $\frac1n$ , such as $\frac{1}{n\log(n)}$ . Now, the sum of that specific example diverges, but it got me wondering about whether $\frac{1}{n}$ is truly the ""boundary"". So, this leads me to two questions. 1) Is there a function $f$ that dominates $\frac{1}{n^p}$ for all $p>1$ , meaning: $$\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{f(x)}{\frac{1}{x^p}}=\infty$$ Such that: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)$$ converges? 2) If so, up to a constant is there a function $g$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty g(n)$ converges, such that $g$ dominates $f$ for all other functions $f$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)$ converges?

3101739,"Trouble understanding sine, cosine of angles greater than $90$ degrees","I recently learned about the trigonometric functions of angles greater than $90$ degrees, and I'm having a hard time understanding the concept. We worked with a diagram like this: My teacher proceeded to tell the class that the sine of angle $\theta$ was equal to the ratio between the opposite side ( $y$ ) and the hypotenuse ( $r$ ). I don't quite understand this logic. I'm familiar with trigonometric functions, but as I remember them, they applied to angles inside a right-triangle, not an angle outside of it. This seems counter-intuitive to me. Shouldn't the sine ratio (or cosine, for that matter) represent the angle $180 - \theta$ located inside the right triangle, rather than outside of it? An explanation would be greatly appreciated, as this is a key part of our current unit.","['trigonometry', 'functions']"
3101819,Show that the carré du champ operator is nonnegative,"Let $(E,\mathcal E)$ be a measurable space $\mathcal M_b(E,\mathcal E):=\left\{f:E\to\mathbb R\mid f\text{ is bounded and }\mathcal E\text{-measurable}\right\}$ $(\kappa_t)_{t\ge0}$ be a Markov semigroup on $(E,\mathcal E)$ and $$\kappa_tf:=\int\kappa_t(\;\cdot\;,{\rm d}y)f(y)\tag1$$ for $f\in\mathcal M_b(E,\mathcal E)$ and $t\ge0$ $\mu$ be a probability measure on $(E,\mathcal E)$ subinvariant with respect to $(\kappa_t)_{t\ge0}$ It's easy to see that $(\kappa_t)_{t\ge0}$ is a contraction semigroup on $\left(\mathcal M_b(E,\mathcal E),\left\|\;\cdot\;\right\|_{L^2(\mu)}\right)$ and hence has a unique extension to a contraction semigroup on $L^2(\mu)$ . Let $(\mathcal D(A),A)$ denote the generator of that semigroup. Let $f\in\mathcal D(A)$ such that $f^2\in\mathcal D(A)$ . I want to show that $$Af^2\ge 2fAf.\tag2$$ The crucial point might be the following: If $g:E\to\mathbb R$ is $\mathcal E$ -measurable and $(\kappa_t|g|)(x)<\infty$ for all $x\in E$ , then $$\varphi\left(\left(\kappa_tg\right)(x)\right)\le\left(\kappa_t\left(\varphi(g)\right)\right)(x)\;\;\;\text{for all }x\in E\tag3$$ for all convex $\varphi:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ by Jensen's inequality (Clearly, for the question we would take $\varphi(x)=x^2$ ). However, it's not clear to me how (and if at all) $(3)$ extends to $g\in L^2(\mu)$ . $^1$ Clearly, we know that there is a $(g_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}\subseteq\mathcal M_b(E,\mathcal E)$ with $$|g_n|\le|g|\;\;\;\text{for all }n\in\mathbb N\tag4$$ and $$g_n\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}g\tag5.$$ By the dominated convergence theorem (and construction of $(\kappa_t)_{t\ge0}$ ), $$\left\|\kappa_tg_n-\kappa_tg\right\|_{L^2(\mu)}\le\left\|g_n-g\right\|_{L^2(\mu)}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0\tag6\;\;\;\text{for all }t\ge0.$$ $(3)$ holds for $g=g_n$ . Moreover, we could extract a subsequence $\left(g_{n_k}\right)_{k\in\mathbb N}$ with $$g_{n_k}\xrightarrow{k\to\infty}g\;\;\;\mu\text{-almost surely}\tag7.$$ But that doesn't mean (does it?) $^2$ that $$\kappa_tg_{n_k}\xrightarrow{k\to\infty}\kappa_tg\;\;\;\mu\text{-almost surely for all }t\ge0\tag8.$$ So, I'm stuck at this point. $^1$ One may note that, by subinvariance, $(\kappa_t|g|)(x)<\infty$ for $\mu$ -almost all $x\in E$ , but I hope that $(3)$ can be proved by a general extension argument. $^2$ Maybe we can argue that $$\left|\kappa_tg_{n_k}-\kappa_tg_{n_l}\right|\le\kappa_t\left|g_{n_k}-g_{n_l}\right|\xrightarrow{k,\:l\to\infty}0\tag9$$ (pointwise) by the dominated convergence theorem and hence $\left(\left(\kappa_tg_{n_k}\right)(x)\right)_{k\in\mathbb N}$ is Cauchy for all $x\in E$ .","['stochastic-analysis', 'markov-process', 'functional-analysis', 'semigroup-of-operators', 'probability-theory']"
3101821,Why does $\sqrt{n} (\bar X - \mu)/S$ have approximately a $t$-distribution?,"Suppose that the random variables $X_1,\ldots, X_n$ are independent and identically distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ . Let $\bar X = (X_1 + \cdots + X_n)/n$ be the sample mean and $S = ((X_1 - \bar X)^2 + \cdots + (X_n - \bar X)^2)/(n-1)$ be the sample variance. If the random variables $X_i$ are normally distributed, then $\sqrt{n}(\bar X - \mu)/\sigma$ is normally distributed and $\sqrt{n}(\bar X - \mu)/S$ has a $t$ -distribution. Moreover, even if the random variables $X_i$ are not normally distributed, then $\sqrt{n}(\bar X - \mu)/\sigma$ is approximately normally distributed, according to the central limit theorem. Question: In this case (where the random variables $X_i$ are not normally distributed), does the central limit theorem also imply that $\sqrt{n}(\bar X - \mu)/S$ has approximately a $t$ -distribution? This question arises in the context of constructing confidence intervals for the mean of a random variable, in the case where the variance is unknown. The following passage appears in Ross's book Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists: Our derivations of the $100(1-\alpha)$ percent confidence intervals
  for the population mean $\mu$ have assumed that the population
  distribution is normal. However, even when this is not the case, if
  the sample size is reasonably large then the intervals obtained will
  still be approximate $100(1-\alpha)$ percent confidence intervals for $\mu$ . This is true because, by the central limit theorem, $\sqrt{n}(\bar X - \mu)/\sigma$ will have approximately a normal
  distribution, and $\sqrt{n}(\bar X - \mu)/S$ will have approximately a $t$ -distribution. I'm trying to understand the final statement about $\sqrt{n}(\bar X - \mu)/S$ having approximately a $t$ -distribution.","['statistics', 'confidence-interval']"

This is based on Exercise 1.2.18. Question: Show that $$Y=\langle u,v\mid u^4=v^3=1, uv=v^2u^2\rangle$$ is defines the trivial group. My Attempt: Tietze transformations are not yet introduced in the text and so they do not apply here. From $v^3=1$ and $u^4=1$ , we have $v^2=v^{-1}$ and $u^3=u^{-1}$ , respectively. Also $u^{-2}=u^2$ . Also, we have \begin{align}

&=(v^2u^2)(uv) \\
&=v^2u^{-1}v \\
&=v^{-1}u^{-1}v \\
&=(uv)^{-1}v \\
&=(v^2u^2)^{-1}v \\
&=u^{-2}v^{-2}v \\
&=\color{red}{u^3v},^\dagger

Hence the group given by $Y$ is trivial as all its generators are trivial. $\square$ My problem is that the proof Exercise 1.2.18 ibid. guides the reader through a different path. Thus I would like to know if my proof holds.

What could be a probable algorithm to build such an array? One probable combination satisfying the above rules for order of array $=4$ , and cardinality of the set of positive integers is $4$ : $$\begin{pmatrix}1&2&3&0\\4&3&0&1\\2&0&4&3\\0&4&1&2\end{pmatrix}$$ Another example involving the order of array $=6$ and number of positive integer options $=4$ , i.e length of tuple of positive entries $=3$ is: \begin{pmatrix}1&2&3&0&0&0\\4&3&0&0&0&1\\2&0&0&0&4&3\\0&0&0&4&3&2\\0&0&4&2&1&0\\0&4&1&3&0&0\end{pmatrix} Also, a very important question is, whether such a n array can be built for every $n$ and $t$ ?

Is there an analogue geometric property of epigraphs of increasing functions?

3103338,"So many different 'varieties', which one is this? Serre's algebraic variety","Anyone who has ever tried to study algebraic geometry has experienced the phenomenon of being burdened by countless types of varieties (variety, affine variety, projective variety, quasi-affine variety, quasi-projective variety, algebraic variety, abstract variety) and having a hard time remembering how you have defined the geometric object you are actually studying. Worse, the terminology from one author to the next can be different (allowing reducible, etc.). Most of this is fine for me, as I have been dealing with it for some time now. I am currently working through Serre's FAC and I am hoping someone can help me 1. Sort out the taxonomy of things we are studying that have 'variety' in the name, 2. Understand the axioms required in his definition and 3. explain some historical context of how Serre's algebraic variety fits into the evolution of the geometric object of interest at a given point in time throughout algebraic geometry, from the most classical zariski closed subsets to certain types of schemes. In section 34, page 40, Serre gives his definition of an `Algebraic Variety'. If my understanding is correct, he wants this thing to be his ultimately general geometric object that we will study, and possibly refine to special cases later. As examples he says 'any locally closed subspace of an affine space with zariski topology is an algebraic variety and any projective variety is an algebraic variety'. I think he is using the term projective variety in the classical sense here. What this means to me is that all the usual varieties (closed subsets of affine space with zariski) are algebraic varieties, all the complements of usual varieties are algebraic varieties (do we really want to allow this?) and any true quasi-affine variety (the intersection of zariski open and closed) is an algebraic variety. And any (classical) projective variety is an algebraic variety. So this algebraic variety object has encompassed all the classical things, and then some. Later it seems we refine our interest back to some classically geometric things, or perhaps find the link between the new abstract thing and the old intuitive thing, by defining an algebraic variety to be affine if it is isomorphic to a closed subvariety of an affine space (so all the usual affine varieties) and defining an algebraic variety to be projective if it is isomorphic to a closed subvariety of projective space. However, I believe there are examples that these definitions do allow for affine algebraic varieties that did not come from classical affine varieties? I believe the affine line without its origin is one such example? Since it is isomorphic to something cut out by a polynomial? So even when restricting to affine and projective algebraic varieties, we have enlarged the concepts a bit (for better or for worse?) ? Now can we talk about the actual definition of an algebraic variety? He defines it to be the following data a topological space $X$ together with a sheaf $\mathscr{O}_X$ that is a subsheaf of the sheaf of germs of functions on $X$ with values in $K$ there exists a finite open cover of $X$ such that each cover element is isomorphic to a locally closed subspace $U_i$ of an affine space equipped with the sheaf $\mathscr{O}_{U_i}$ . The diagonal of $X \times X$ is closed in $X \times X$ . Combining 1 and 2 I feel like he is basically saying we need the object to be a locally ringed space that is obtained by gluing together quasi affine varieties? Am I way off here? Is there more subtlety to this? And what is the purpose of 3? Out of all the axioms this is the only one that is really just baffling to me. What does this axiom do for us? Also, how does this definition of an 'algebraic variety' fit into the evolution of algebraic geometry? Next up would be the scheme theoretic definition, and we certainly see some similarities I think? With each evolution and generalization of the geometric object 'variety', 'algebraic variety', 'integrally closed and separated scheme' - are we able to learn more about the original classical objects (zariski closed subsets?) or do we just keep adding in new things to study that were not allowed before?","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'coherent-sheaves', 'sheaf-theory']"
3103345,"Why do we need to treat proper schemes, not only projective schemes?","I know that many complete varieties are projective: For example, complete curves, smooth complete surfaces, arithmetic surfaces, and abelian varieties are projective.
And even for general proper schemes, Chow's lemma says these are ""almost"" projective.
And I think that concrete objects what we want to study are projective (e.g., when we try to find solutions of an quation, we treat these as a projective vaiety). As I said many varieties are projective in practice, however, sometimes algebraic geometers take time to generalize propositions to proper schemes. So my question is, why do we need to treat proper schemes?
Or equivalently, please give me examples of concrete proper non-projective schemes which is itself application. Thank you very much!","['algebraic-geometry', 'soft-question']"
3103382,Definition of a piecewise smooth path,"In Apostol's ""Mathematical Analysis"" $($ page 435 $)$ , a piecewise smooth path in the complex plane, say $f$ , is defined as a path in the complex plane that has bounded derivative $f'$ which is continuous everywhere except possibly at a finite number of points, and at these exceptional points it is required that both right- and left-hand derivatives exist. Specifically, if $f:[a,b]\rightarrow C$ is a complex-valued function on the compact interval $[a,b]$ ,
then $f$ is said to be piecewise smooth if there exists a partition $\{x_0,x_1,...x_n\}$ of $[a,b]$ such that $f$ has a bounded and continuous derivative on each open subinterval $(x_{i-1},x_i)$ and has one-sided derivatives at the endpoints $x_{i-1}$ and $x_i$ . However, in the definition of a piecewise smooth path in most books on complex analysis, it is required that the restriction of $f$ to each compact subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ has a ""continuous"" derivative on $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ . The requirement in this definition is stronger than that of Apostol since at the endpoints $x_{i-1}$ and $x_i$ it requires that $\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{i-1}+}f'(x)=f'_{+}(x_{i-1})$ and $\lim_{x\rightarrow x_i-}f'(x)=f'_{-}(x_i)$ .

3103614,How to encode a line of points so you can connect long distances using short lines,"So this is mostly a computer problem but this aspect is really math heavy and could probably be easily solved with some math insight so I thought I'd ask here. It might seem a little computery at first, but I hope to think it's mostly a math problem. I am thinking about Memory Address Spaces , which you can imagine as like a page of monospaced text. Essentially it's a grid like a cartesian grid, where the content flows from left to right. So it's essentially one lone line. Each ""slot"" in this line is an address (1 byte let's say, but I don't think it matters for this question). What I'm thinking about is how to effectively ""point"" to different areas in the address space from other areas in the address space. You can visualize it as a line like this.... ___________________________________________
| | |8| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
               ^ So basically, address 3 points to address 8 by containing a 1-byte value 8 in its slot. I would draw it with more slots but there's not enough room. But on a typical computer there could be several billion I think. But lets just say there are a lot of addressable slots and that this line is very long, like DNA perhaps. The problem is this. While the above example ""works"" because the number 8 is less than 1 byte, if we instead wanted to point to position 1000 we couldn't because for our purposes, we are limited to 1-byte or position 256. The way this is typically solved in computer science is to just have 4-byte pointers (32-bits) instead of 1-byte (8-bit) pointers. This gives sufficiently large values so you can't really use them all without running into unrelated problems like memory limits and such. But I would like to try to solve this differently in this example. Instead of using 32-bit pointers, I'm wondering if there is a way to somehow use a bundle of 8-bit pointers in some way which I have been having a hard time imagining and so it will be hard to explain. Basically, say you are at slot 10,000 (10k), and want to point to something at position 1 million (1M). If it was 32-bits, then we could just plop in a large integer 1M and we are done. But since we are limited to 8-bit integers only (or 7 or 6-bit, etc., I don't mind either way, but 8 makes it easy, just something small), we have to do something tricky, which in some sense seems sort of like hashing in a hashing function. What I'm wondering is if you can do something like the following.... 50 (some other 8-bit value)
                          jump a few    /
                               times   /           we can navigate here

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ... 10k ...         ...         1M
                     ^                           ^ To explain, in the address slot 10k we have value 123. This allows us to jump in some way to some other slot . We do this jumping a few times, by grabbing values at the next address slot we land at, until we get to the destination address point of 1M. That is to say, there is a way to point from 10k to 1M using only 8-bit values . This would be easy and have an obvious solution if it wasn't limited by the fact that I left out: there can only be one value in a slot at a time. So after a program runs for a while, you can imagine that the slots would be filled, with holes here and there like Swiss cheese. So you might not be able to guarantee that you can reach within 256 from your current location to the next location along the line. What I'm imagining instead is somehow structuring the system sort of like an R-tree or Octree . So it would look something like this, where the line in the next diagram is zoomed out to be just 1 dimention. 1

 |________________________________________________||_________________ ... ______| So basically, you have sort of nested boxes which are numbered within the range of 1-256 . Then here's where I get totally lost.... It seems like you could somehow combine your current value (say we were at 123 again) with this ""box encoding system"", and you would end up with 1M. Or if not that, then maybe you could imagine multiplying 123 by its containing box to get some offset and wallah, you are at 1M. That's basically what I'm wondering. If there is any mathematical way to encode these 8-bit numbers, perhaps by segmenting the lines into conceptual rectangles or some other grouping mechanism, such that you could obtain a value outside of the range. Some way of organizing them. In the computer sense, you could use an 8-bit value to point to a value far outside the 8-bit range, seemingly in the 24 or 32 bit range. Sidenote, there are all kinds of ways you could technically make this work by adding extra data around the nodes, but I don't want to do that, I want to see if it's possible to somehow create an encoding, perhaps along the lines of the R-tree or Octree, that can solve this problem .","['data-structure', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms']"

3103799,On a mistake in a derivation regarding a recurrence relation.,"Suppose we have a sequence $\{u_t \}_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$ given by the recurrence relation $$u_{t+1} = q_0 u_t + q_1 u_{t-1} + \dots + q_p u_{t-p} + \epsilon, \quad  \epsilon >0$$ where $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and $q_1, \dots, q_p$ are such that the roots $r_0,r_1, \dots, r_p$ of the associated homogeneous characteristic equation $$r^{p+1} - q_0 r^p - q_1 r^{p-1}- \dots - q_p = 0 $$ lie inside the unit circle and the sequence is strictly positive. We can render the sequence homogeneous by settting $u^* = \epsilon / (1 - q_0 - q_1 - \dots -q_p) $ and noticing that $$(u_{t+1} -u^*)  = q_0 (u_t - u^*) + q_1 (u_{t-1} - u^*) + \dots + q_p (u_{t-p} - u^*) $$ It is known that the solution to this recurrence will have the form $$u_{t+1} - u^* = a_0 r_0^{t+1}+a_1 r_1^{t+1}+ \dots + a_p r_p^{t+1}$$ where $a_0,a_1, \dots, a_p$ are real numbers and $r_0, r_1, \dots , r_p$ are the roots of the characteristic equation.
Taking the limit for $t \rightarrow \infty$ and recalling that the roots where assumed inside the unit circle we obtain that $$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} u_{t+1 } = u^*$$ but (it seems to me) $u^*$ can be negative and the sequence was taken strictly positive. Where is the mistake? Edit: The Eneström–Kakeya theorem (see this link) seems to imply that we can construct a polynomial with all roots inside the unit circle and such that $u^* = \epsilon / (1 - q_0 - q_1 - \dots -q_p) $ is negative.

3103801,Find the complementary solution of the following differential equation.,"I need to find the general solution of the following differential equation: $$
y''' - y'' - y' + y = 4e^{-t} + 3
$$ My solution: I tried to find the complementary solution first. That is, the solution to the homogeneous equation $y''' - y'' - y' + y = 0$ . If I assume that $y = e^{rt}$ then I have the following characteristic equation: $$
r^3 - r^2 - r + 1 = 0
$$ which has the following roots $$
(r+1)(r-1)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \,r = -1, \,r = 1, \,r = 1
$$ Since we have repeated roots I assume that the solution is of the form $y = v(t)e^{-t}$ and I then try to figure out what the function $v(t)$ should look like. I proceeded as follows: \begin{align}
y &= v(t)e^{-t}\\
y' &= v'(t)e^{-t} - v(t)e^{-t}\\
y'' &= v''(t)e^{-t} - 2v'(t)e^{-t} + v(t)e^{-t}\\
y''' &= v'''(t)e^{-t} - 3v''(t)e^{-t} + 3v'(t)e^{-t} - v(t)e^{-t}
\end{align} If I substitute this back into the initial equation I get the following: $$
v'''(t) - 4v''(t) + 4v'(t) = 0
$$ I think I need to figure out what $v(t)$ looks like based on this equation but I don't really know how. I get $$
v(t) = v''(t) - 1/4v''(t) + c_1
$$ but this doesn't get me anywhere. Question: How do I find the complementary solution of the initial differential equation?",['ordinary-differential-equations']

If $p\mapsto \dim K_p$ is continuous, then $\ker\tilde f,$ the union of all the $K_p,$ is a bundle over $B_1.$ The solution to this problem, along with the part after it, seems to rely on the fact that the subspaces $K_p$ ""vary continuously"" with the variable $p.$ I'm not exactly sure how one would even go about showing this, or if that's what I should be trying to do at all (perhaps that will be an artifact of a correct solution).

3104099,Converting between Solution forms using Green's Functions in Linear Differential Equation,"EDIT: Bounty is over tomorrow so I tried to clean up the question a bit, and put the additional work below as optional to read. I summarized the current results and the solution form I am trying to convert to. I know the solution from the book, but I am unsure how it was reached. I am nearly there, but am having trouble getting the correct form, since the final form looks so much different from the work I've done leading up to it. After a lot of hunting, I realized it's using Green's functions to show the answer, but I couldn't find anything helpful enough that was in 3 variables like my problem. So I need help formulating the solution in the proper form instead of the basic linear form. The basic idea of the system here is that there is a variable $x$ , and it changes, up and down, with $m$ the running minimum and $M$ the running maximum. Once the variable $x$ reaches a distance $L$ above $m$ OR a distance $L$ below $M$ , (for the first time) the value of the function $u$ is known. This basic idea is already imposed in the differential equation and its boundaries below. I mostly need help on figuring out how to formulate the Green's functions/integrals so the solution form looks the way it does below. Most of the work I have shown below is for solving the general system, so it can be skipped if it's not relevant for finding the solution form. I basically just solve for $a(m,M)$ and $b(m,M)$ in the linear solution form $$u(x,m,M) = a(m,M)x + b(m,M)$$ which may be helpful for the Green's functions but I am unsure. Thanks! Problem: $$
\begin{align}
\partial_x^2u(x,m,M) = 0,  m < x < M \tag{1}
\\ \partial_Mu(x,m,M)|_{x=M} = 0 \tag{2}
\\ \partial_mu(x,m,M)|_{x=m} = 0 \tag{3}
\\ u(m,m,L+m) = \Phi(m) \tag{4}
\\u(M,M-L,M) = \Phi(M) \tag{5}
\end{align}$$ Solution: $$u(x,m,M) = L^{-1}((M-x)\Phi(M-L) + (x-m)\Phi(m+L)) + L^{-2}{\huge(}\int_{M-L}^m(x-y)\Phi(y)dy + \int_M^{m+L}(y-x)\Phi(y)dy{\huge)}$$ So far I have the equation $$u(x,m,M) = \frac{\Phi(L+m) - \Phi(m)}{L} * x + \frac{(L+m)\Phi(m) - m\Phi(L+m)}{L}$$ but have no idea how to get this to the solution form. I am pretty sure this is a correct equation, but if you have doubts you can check my work below. Equating the two answers, I need to find a way to show the following equality: $$(m+L - x)\Phi(m) = \\(M-x)\Phi(M-L) + L^{-1}{\huge(}\int_{M-L}^m(x-y)\Phi(y)dy + \int_M^{m+L}(y-x)\Phi(y)dy{\huge)}$$ but I am unsure if it is just better to work with the original equations. ADDITIONAL WORK BUT NOT NECESSARY Work so far (mine plus some steps in the book): Using $(1)$ , the solution form is linear in $x$ , so: $$u(x,m,M) = a(m,M)x + b(m,M) \tag{6}$$ Using $(6)$ to rewrite $(4)$ and $(5)$ : $$u(m,m,L+m) = \Phi(m) = a(m,L+m)m + b(m,L+m) \tag{7}$$ $$u(M,M-L,M) = u(L+m,m,L+m) = \Phi(L+m) =\\ a(m,L+m)(L+m) + b(m,L+m) \tag{8} $$ Equation $(8)$ comes from the fact that if $x$ reaches a distance $L$ above $m$ (for the first time), then $M = L + m$ , and so $x = M = L +m$ . From $(7)$ and $(8)$ we calculate $a(m,L+m)$ and $b(m,L+m)$ , by subtracting $(7)$ from $(8)$ to solve for $a(m,L+m)$ and then substituting $a(m,L+m)$ into $(7)$ to solve for $b(m,L+m)$ : $$a(m,L+m) = \frac{\Phi(L+m) - \Phi(m)}{L} \tag{9} $$ $$b(m,L+m) = \frac{(L+m)\Phi(m) - m\Phi(L+m)}{L} \tag{10} $$ The book says that equations $(2)$ and $(3)$ can be integrated (from $L+m$ to $M$ ) and it can be shown that $\partial_{mM}b(m,M) = 0$ . And therefore the following equation is true $$\partial_mb(m,M) = \partial_mb(m,L+m) = \partial_m{\huge(}\frac{(L+m)\Phi(m) - m\Phi(L+m)}{L}{\huge)} \tag{11}$$ And finally, (I think many steps are skipped), the book says that by integrating $(11)$ , the solution above is reached. So I think we are supposed to use $(11)$ to calculate $b(m,M)$ , so I did the following: $$\int_{M-L}^m\partial_{m}b(m,M)dm = b(m,M) - b(M-L,M) = \int_{M-L}^m\partial_m{\huge(}\frac{(L+m)\Phi(m) - m\Phi(L+m)}{L}{\huge)} = \\ {\huge(}\frac{(L+m)\Phi(m) - m\Phi(L+m)}{L}{\huge)} - {\huge(}\frac{(M)\Phi(M-L) - (M-L)\Phi(M)}{L}{\huge)}$$ And so solving for $b(m,M)$ , using (from $(5)$ ) that $b(M-L,M) = \Phi(M) - a(M-L,M)*M$ and from $(4)$ and $(5)$ that $a(M-L,M) = \frac{\Phi(M) - \Phi(M-L)}{L}$ , we have: $$b(m,M) = b(M-L,M) + {\huge(}\frac{(L+m)\Phi(m) - m\Phi(L+m)}{L}{\huge)} - {\huge(}\frac{(M)\Phi(M-L) - (M-L)\Phi(M)}{L}{\huge)} = \frac{(L+m)\Phi(m) - m\Phi(L+m)}{L}$$ So I have $b(m,M)$ solved for, but have no idea how to get from there to the correct solution for $u(x,m,M)$ since it seems like the solution uses the boundary conditions somehow instead of directly plugging in $b(m,M)$ .

As a stack $B\mathbb{G}_m$ is given by $[*/\mathbb{G}_m]$ , but it isn't clear to me how to provide an $\acute{e}$ tale cover that would provide a reasonable Čech cohomology calculation.","['etale-cohomology', 'algebraic-stacks', 'algebraic-geometry']"
3104217,PMF of throwing a die 4 times,"We throw a fair 6-sided die independently four times and let $X$ denote the minimal value rolled. What is the probability that $X \ge 4$ ? Compute the PMF of $X$ . Determine the mean and variance of $X$ . My attempt: $(1/2)^4$ because that means each of the $4$ rolls, you either get a $4, 5$ or $6$ . for $X=1: (1/6)(6/6)(6/6)(6/6)$ for $X=2: (1/6)(5/6)(5/6)(5/6)$ for $X=3: (1/6)(4/6)(4/6)(4/6)$ for $X=4: (1/6)(3/6)(3/6)(3/6)$ for $X=5: (1/6)(2/6)(2/6)(2/6)$ for $X=6: (1/6)(1/6)(1/6)(1/6)$ I can calculate this once I know I did the PMF correctly Did I do (1) and (2) correctly?","['dice', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

3104233,Non-existence of the potential function,"I am wondering why this theorem is not true when $(f,g)$ are defined on a more general open set $U$ which is not necessarily the entire plane or some disc. What is an example of a vector field $$F(x,y)=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$$ defined on some open set $U$ satisfying the condition $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}$$ but $F$ does not have a potential function?","['partial-derivative', 'vector-fields', 'multivariable-calculus', 'examples-counterexamples']"
3104236,Probability of getting at least one job offer based on interview odds,"I have recently interviewed for a number of jobs, and am wondering what the odds are of getting accepted for one based on the odds of each interview and the total number of interviews. I had $7$ interviews which had a $1$ in $10$ chance of securing a job ( $10$ interviewees for every applicant). I had another interview with a $6\%$ chance, another with a $5\%$ chance, and another with a $14\%$ chance. So in total, $10$ places with odds of $10\%$ , $10\%$ , $10\%$ , $10\%$ , $10\%$ , $10\%$ , $10\%$ , $14\%$ , $6\%$ , $5\%$ . 
I know that I cannot simply add the numbers, but I am also stumped in that I am trying to find the odds of not one job offer, but a minimum of one offer....so the odds of either one positive return, two positive return, etc. vs the odds of all $10$ interviews coming up negative. Anyone know how to calculate this problem?",['probability']
3104247,"Problem with showing the integrability of $\int_{B}(x^2+y^2)^{-3/2}d\lambda^2(x,y)$","Define $B:=\{(x,y) \in \mathbb R^{2}: x^2+y^2\leq1\}$ , determine whether $$

\quad \text{and} \quad
\int_{\mathbb R^2-B}\frac{1}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}d\lambda^2(x,y)
$$ are integrable. My ideas: Set $C:=\{(x,y) \in \mathbb R_{+}^{2}: x^2+y^2\leq1\}$ to get $$
\begin{split}
I &= \int_{B}\frac{1}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}d\lambda^2(x,y) \\
  &= 2\int_{C}\frac{1}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}} d\lambda^2(x,y)

  &= 2\int_0^1 \int_0^\pi \frac{rd\phi dr}{r^3} \\
  &= 2\pi \left[\left.-\frac{1}{r}\right|_{0}^{1}\right]
   =\infty

$$ I do not know what to say on the case $$\int_{\mathbb R^2-B}\frac{1}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}d\lambda^2(x,y).$$ It is clear that it is not integrable but how do I show this? Questions : In the above case finding $$
\int_B \left|\frac{1}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}\right|d\lambda^2(x,y)
$$ was easy due to the symmetry of on $B$ , but how can I solve a problem like when there is no symmetry involved? Do I simply divide the functions in positive and negative parts? Our professors are very pedantic on the use of correct reasoning. I need to reason why I can write $$\int_{B}|\frac{1}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}|d\lambda^2(x,y),$$ in other words I need to reason why $$\left|\frac{1}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}\right|$$ is measurable but surely I cannot show this as ( $f$ measurable $\Rightarrow |f|$ measurable ) is not true in general is it?","['integration', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
