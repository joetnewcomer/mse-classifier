1320192,Continuity of a function $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$,"It's easy to check that the function $$ f_1(x, y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x y}{x^2 + y^2} &\text{if (x, y) ≠ (0, 0)}\\0&\text{if (x, y) = (0, 0)}\end{cases}$$ is not continuous in $0$, because e.g. the sequence $f(\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ won't converge against $0$. But how can I prove that the very similar function $f_2$, defined as: $$ f_2(x, y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x y^2}{x^2 + y^2} &\text{if (x, y) ≠ (0, 0)}\\0&\text{if (x, y) = (0, 0)}\end{cases}$$ actually is continuous in $0$? Choosing any sequence of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that converges against $(0, 0)$ didn't lead anywhere so far, and I imagine that using the $\epsilon-\delta$-criteria could maybe work, but would probably get to complicated and that there's hopefully an easier way to check this.","['analysis', 'continuity', 'multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"
1320248,What would a base $\pi$ number system look like?,"Imagine if we used a base $\pi$ number system, what would it look like? Wouldn't it make certain problems more intuitive (eg: area and volume calculations simpler in some way)? This may seem like a stupid question but I do not remember this concept ever being explored in my Engineering degree. Surely there is some application to the real world here. I am interested in answers that demonstrate which problems would become more elegant to represent and compute. I am also interested in any visualizations that leverage the meaning of that scale. Never-mind a logarithmic scale, what would a $\pi$arithmic scale be and what would simple areas on it mean? From the comments, I realise that the normal representation of numbers is flawed (or difficult to use) for this idea, so maybe it's worth modifying it slightly.
eg: let: $[1] = 1.\pi^0 = 1$ $[2][1] = 2.\pi^1 + 1.\pi^0 = 2\pi + 1$ $[2.3][1] = 2.3 . \pi^1 + 1.\pi^0 = 2.3\pi + 1$ $[1][2][3] = 1.\pi^2 + 2.\pi^1 + 3.\pi^0 = \pi^2+2\pi+3 $","['number-theory', 'pi']"
1320259,Properly discontinuous action on manifold,"I am actually not familiar with topology, but since we had a short outlook on these things in our differential geometry lecture today, I would appreciate some general remarks: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $\Gamma$ a group of diffeomorphisms on $M$ , then $\Gamma$ is called properly discontinuous, if 1.) and 2.) hold. $1.) \forall p \in M \exists p\in U$ (open nbh.) $ \forall \phi \in \Gamma \backslash\{id\}: \phi(U) \cap U = \emptyset. $ This seems to tell me that there is basically no fixed point under such a non-trivial diffeomorphism (even more, we get that we can separate the image by an open nbh.) $2.) \forall p,q \in M,$ where $q$ is not in the orbit of $p$ there are open nbhs $U(p),U(q)$ such that $\phi(U(p)) \cap U(q) = \emptyset$ for all $\phi \in \Gamma.$ First question:
I feel that the second property is often skipped in textbooks, but don't know why?! To me, it seems to be similar to a Hausdorff property in $M/\Gamma.$ Now, we showed that such a group $\Gamma$ implies that $M/\Gamma$ is again a manifold and the projection $\pi: M \rightarrow M/\Gamma$ is a covering map. In this sense $\Gamma$ can be regarded as the group of deck transformations. If $M$ is simply connected, then this group can be also considered as the fundamental group of $M / \Gamma.$ Second question: If I understand this correctly, then the converse also holds. $M/\Gamma$ is a manifold, only if $\Gamma$ acts properly discontinuous on $M$ ? Third question: In this thread Lee Mosher argues that properly discontinuous is not sufficient to conclude that $M \rightarrow M/\Gamma$ is a covering map (see his comments). Is this also true for my definition?  Actually I don't understand why free action is not a corollary of my first part of the definition, cause it just means that the only group element that is allowed to have fixed points is the identity?","['manifolds', 'general-topology', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"
1320263,Integrate $ \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\tan^{-1}(x)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx$ without using Hyperbolic Functions,"I originally had to solve this Integral: $$ \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\tan^{-1}(x)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx$$ It was suggested to me that I introduce the parameter $a$ and then try Differentiation Under the Integral Sign. I thus rewrote the Integral as 
$$ I(a)=\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\tan^{-1}(ax)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx$$
$$\Longrightarrow I'(a)= \int_0^1\dfrac{y}{(1+(ay)^2)(\sqrt{1-y^2})}dy$$

1320302,How to integrate $e^{-\cos(\theta)}\cos(\theta + \sin(\theta))$,"I am struggling to find a way to evaluate the following real integral: $$\int_{0}^{2\pi}e^{-\cos(\theta)}\cos(\theta + \sin(\theta))\:\mathrm{d}\theta$$ The exercise started by asking me to calculate: $$\oint_{C}e^{-\frac{1}{z}}\:\mathrm{d}z$$ Where $C$ is the unit circle centered on the origin. Using Cauchy's Residue theorem, we have: $$\oint_{C}e^{-\frac{1}{z}}\:\mathrm{d}z = 2\pi i\operatorname{Res}(f(z),0)=-2\pi i$$ Now, I would like to use this to evaluate the real integral I am asked to. So I began by noting that if we set $z = e^{i\theta}$ on the unit circle, then: $$e^{-\frac{1}{z}}=e^{-e^{-i\theta}}=e^{-\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta)}=e^{-\cos(\theta)}e^{i\sin(\theta)}=e^{-\cos(\theta)}(\cos(\sin(\theta))+i\sin(\sin(\theta)))$$ The real part of this function looks promisingly like the integrand, but not quite, so I'm unsure how I can proceed? I am also asked as an extension to calculate: $$\int_{0}^{2\pi}e^{-\cos(\theta)}\sin(\theta + \sin(\theta))\:\mathrm{d}\theta$$ But I assume the method to calculate this will become clear when I have found how to get the extra additive $\theta$ in the trigonometric function in the integrand.","['complex-numbers', 'complex-integration', 'contour-integration', 'integration', 'complex-analysis']"
1320321,Connection Between Convergence on Natural Boundary and Weierstrass Functions,"So, I was fooling around thinking about constructing functions on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$, which cannot be extended to the boundary by Hadamard's Gap Theorem. At first I constructed the function 
$$f(z):=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{\frac {z^{k!}}{k^2} }$$ Since, I know that it will converge absolutely even on $\partial\mathbb D$. When I plotted the Real part of this function on the boundary, I noticed a very familiar Weierstrass-like function. (Which is not surprising to me after thinking about what this series actually is on the boundary) My first question is: 1) Is the Real part of a function constructed similarly to this always a nowhere differentiable function of $\theta$ on the boundary of $\mathbb D$. And my second question is: 2) It appears that $$g(z):=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{\frac {z^{k^2}}{k^2} }$$ also looks nowhere differentiable on the boundary by inspection on Mathematica. But, $$\lim_{k\to \infty}{\frac {(k+1)^2}{k^2}}=1$$ so, I don't believe Hadamard's Gap Theorem can be applied here. Is this function also not extendable to a holomorphic function on any larger domain as well? (In general, if you could comment on the connection between non-differentiability on the boundary and extendability of the power series to larger domains at points on the boundary.)

1320343,Random Sequence of Alternating Increase/Decrease Numbers,"The problem statement: Repeatedly pick a random number (uniformly-distributed) between $0$ and $1$.

1320350,Characterization of Semidirect Products: Too strong assumptions?,"In John Lee's book Introduction to Smooth Manifolds , there is the following Theorem. Theorem 7.35 (Characterization of Semidirect Products). Suppose $G$ is a Lie group, and $N,H\subseteq G$ are closed Lie subgroups such that $N$ is normal, $N\cap H=\{e\}$, and $NH=G$. Then the map $(n,h)\mapsto nh$ is a Lie group isomorphism between $N\rtimes_\theta H$ and $G$, where $\theta:H\times N\to N$ is the action by conjugation: $\theta_h(n)=hnh^{-1}$. The proof is left as an exercise so I cannot verify if I am correct, but I believe that it is unnecessary to assume that $H$ is a closed Lie subgroup. It appears that we only need $H$ to be an immersed Lie subgroup of $G$ (but $N$ still needs to be closed). Am I correct? Here is my proof without assuming that $H$ is closed: Proof. We first show that $\theta$ is smooth. Since $N$ is normal, we have $\theta_h(H\times N)\subseteq N$. Moreover, $N$ is an embedded submanifold of $G$ since it is closed (Theorem 7.21), and $H\times N$ is an immersed submanifold of $G\times G$, so the conjugation map $C:G\times G\to G$, $C(a,b)=aba^{-1}$ restricts to a smooth map $\theta:H\times N\to N$ (Corollaries 5.27 and 5.30). Moreover, for each $h\in H$, $\theta_h:N\to N$ is a Lie group isomorphism, so $\theta$ is an action by automorphisms and hence defines a semi-direct product $N\rtimes_\theta H$. Now, the map
$$F:N\rtimes_\theta H\to G,\quad F(n,h)=nh$$
is smooth since it is the restriction of the multiplication map $m:G\times G\to G$ to the immersed submanifold $N\times H$ of $G\times G$. Moreover, $F$ is a Lie group homomorphism since
$$F((n,h)(n',h'))=F(nhn'h^{-1},hh')=nhn'h^{-1}hh'=nhn'h'=F(n,h)F(n',h').$$
Therefore, $F$ has constant rank (Theorem 7.5) so, by the Global Rank Theorem, to show that it is a diffeomorphism it suffices to show that it is bijective. But if $F(n,h)=nh=e$ then, $h^{-1}nh=h^{-1}\in N\cap H=\{e\}$, so $h=e$ and $n=e$. Thus, $F$ is injective, and also surjective since $NH=G$. $\tag{Q.E.D.}$","['smooth-manifolds', 'lie-groups', 'proof-verification', 'semidirect-product', 'differential-geometry']"

If I consider the euclidean function $N: Z[i] \setminus \{0 \}  \to  \mathbb N$ defined as $N(a+bi)=a^2+b^2$, then I can express any element $z$ in $\mathbb Z[i]$ as $z=(1+2i)q+r$ with $N(r)=1,2,3,4$ or $r=0$.

1320369,Chernoff-like bound for small intervals in tail distribution,"I am searching for a Chernoff-like bound that controls the probability of small intervals in the tail distribution. More specifically, let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be independent random variables with values in $[0,1]$. Let $X := \sum X_i$ and $\mu := \mathbb E[X]$. My conjecture is that, for $\lambda \in [0,\sqrt{\mu}]$, an inequality like the following holds:
$$\mathbb P[ \mu + \lambda \sqrt{\mu} \leq X \leq \mu + \lambda\sqrt{\mu} + 1] \leq \frac{e^{-\lambda^2/3}}{\sqrt{\pi \mu}}.$$
(I'll be happy if you need to include diverse absolute constants in the right hand side, even in the exponential... Also, note that I've chosen the width of the interval to be large enough to avoid discretization issues.) Here's why I think this inequality holds. First, it can be proved that $Var X \leq \mu$, with equality in the extreme case where $X$ is a Poisson distribution (and thus, intuitively, a sum of infinitely many independent random variables). When $X$ is a Poisson distribution, the inequality does hold. Moreover, by analogy with the normal distribution, my intuition is that, when $\lambda \geq 1$, because the Poisson distribution maximizes the variance, it also maximizes the left-hand side above (up to discretization artefacts). Indeed, the probability density function $f_\sigma(x)$ of $\mathcal N(0,\sigma^2)$ for $\sigma \in [0,1]$ and restricted to $x \geq 1$ is increasing in $\sigma$. Any help is welcome. Thank you! EDIT: It seems that, using a non-uniform Berry-Esseen bound, one can get a bound of $O \left( \frac{1}{\lambda^3 \sqrt{\mu}} \right)$.

My idea was to use bump functions and the likes, but for that I had to make the line segments lie at $y = 0$ and $y = 1$. Of course, the transformation that transported the segments would have to be a diffeomorphism (at least of some set containing the segments). This I readily found to be equivalent to prescribing the image of four points under some diffeomorphism. A couple ways of doing this occurred to me, but I encountered this question in the process. What restrictions are there on the cardinal of a set A\subset\Bbb R^2 such that there exists a (auto) diffeomorphism f with f(A) = B for some fixed $B\subset \Bbb R^2? (Obviously #B = # A) In light of developments, I'll ask for which homeomorphic $A,B\subset\Bbb R^2$ is there a diffeomorphism of $\Bbb R^2$ (or an open set containing $A$,$B$) sending $A$ to $B$? If $\#A<\infty$ there always exists such an $f$, constructed by appropriate polynomials. (e.g. $f(x,y) = (ax^2+bxy+cy^2,a'x^2+b'xy+c'y^2)$ allows for six points, and so on.

For any set $Z$, consider $$C_{00}(Z)=\{(d_\gamma)_{\gamma\in Z}\in\mathbb{K}^Z:d_\gamma\neq0 \mbox{ only for a finite number of indexes }\gamma\}.$$
Let $F\in L(X,Y)$ and $x\in X$. Then there exist a unique $a=(a_\alpha)\in C_{00}(S)$ such that $x=\sum_\alpha a_\alpha x_\alpha$. 
Also, for each $\alpha\in S$, there is a unique $M_\alpha=(b_{\beta,\alpha})_\beta\in C_{00}(T)$ such that $F(x_\alpha)=\sum_\beta b_{\beta,\alpha}y_\beta$. 
Thus 
$$F(x)=\sum_\alpha a_\alpha F(x_\alpha)=\sum_\alpha a_\alpha\bigg(\sum_\beta b_{\beta,\alpha}y_\beta\bigg)=\sum_\beta \bigg(\sum_\alpha b_{\beta,\alpha}a_\alpha\bigg)y_\beta$$

There are 4 different consonants and 6 vowels (with 2 Identical I's and A's) So ${{4} \choose {2}}(2!)$ would be the consonants and ${6 \choose 2}(2!) $would be the vowels (still including repetition for now) Now I'd take these two and times by 7!

(4 answers) Rooks on a 8 by 8 checker board. Probability problem (3 answers) Closed 4 years ago . 8 rooks are randomly placed on different squares of a chessboard. A rook is said to attack all of the squares in its row and its column.  Compute the probability that every square is occupied or attacked by at least 1 rook. The first step I took was to state that there are $64C8$ ways to decide how to place the 8 rooks on the chessboard. Next, I tried to experiment with a physical chessboard to see how this could be done. The only way I found that every square on the board can be attacked is if one rook is in either every horizontal row or every vertical row. Therefore, there are $2 * 8^8 - 2$ ways to place the rooks.

For example, it's possible to find a collection of disjoint closed disks of positive radius whose union contains $\mathbb{Q}\times\mathbb{Q}$. It is easy to show that the complement of a countable set of points in the plane is always path connected. In particular, if $S \subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is countable, then there is always 
path between any two points in $\mathbb{R}^2-S$ consisting of two line segments.

1321769,"What are ""instantaneous"" rates of change, really?","Here's how I see it (please read the following if you can, because I address a lot of arguments people have already made): Let's take instantaneous speed, for example. If it's truly instantaneous, then there is no change in $x$ (time), since there's no time interval . Thus, in $\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$,  $h$ should actually be zero (not arbitrarily close to zero, since that would still be an interval) and therefore instantaneous speed is undefined. If ""instantaneous"" is just a figure of speech for ""very very very small"", then I have two problems with it: Firstly,  well it's not instantaneous at all in the sense of ""at a single moment"". Secondly, how is ""very very very small"" conceptually different from ""small""? What's really the difference between considering $1$ second and $10^{-200}$ of a second? I've heard some people talk about ""infinitely small"" quantities. This doesn't make any sense to me. In this case, what's the process by which a number goes from ""not infinitely small"" to ""ok, now you're infinitely small""?
Where's the dividing line in degree of smallness beyond which a number is infinitely small? I understand $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$ as the limit of an infinite sequence of ratios, I have no problem with that. But I thought the point of a limit and infinity in general, is that you never get there.
For example, when people say ""the sum of an infinite geometric series"", they really mean ""the limit"", since you can't possibly add infinitely many terms in the arithmetic sense of the word. So again in this case, since you never get to the limit, $h$ is always some interval, and therefore the rate is not ""instantaneous"". 
Same problem with integrals actually; how do you add up infinitely many terms? Saying you can add up an infinity or terms implies that infinity is a fixed number.","['calculus', 'soft-question', 'derivatives']"

1321858,An improper integral with parameter $\int_{1}^{+\infty}\frac{\ln(1+x^p)}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}$,"I have to analyse the convergence of this integral: $$\int_{1}^{+\infty}\frac{\ln(1+x^p)}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}$$ where $p\in \mathbb{R}$. I have thought to write: $$\int_{1}^{c}\frac{\ln(1+x^p)}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}+\int_{c}^{+\infty}\frac{\ln(1+x^p)}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}$$ For the second integral, I know that $\frac{\ln(1+x^p)}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}<\frac{(1+x^p)}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}$ so I can study the second one: if p>0: $1+x^p\sim x^p$, $\sqrt{x^2-1}\sim x$, so I obtain: $\frac{(1+x^p)}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\sim \frac{1}{x^{1-p}}$ that converges if p<0. But I have said that p must be >0, so I don't obtain solutions. If p<0 the intergral function that I use to compare it with the mine, diverges. So, for the theorem on asymptotic comparision, my integral diverges. But I don't know how to bring out something about the first integral....","['convergence-divergence', 'calculus', 'improper-integrals', 'integration']"
1321871,Why does this sequence converge to $e^{x^2}$?,"I came across the limit
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{x^2}{n^2}\right)^{n^2}
$$
and
immediately speculated that it is
$$
\exp\left(x^2\right)
$$
what e.g. Maple spits out perfectly. My idea was that the elementary formula
$$
\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{x^2}{n^2}\right)^{n}\right)^n
=\exp\left(\frac{x^2}{n}\cdot n\right)=e^{x^2}
$$
could be taken for a ""proof"" but i admit it seems more like a make-belief-argument when one knows the solution already. How would one argue precisely to get a 100%-proof ? My analysis trickery is not so rich any more.","['sequences-and-series', 'limits', 'real-analysis']"
1321874,The set of irrational numbers is not a $F_{\sigma}$ set.,"I want to proove that the set of irrational numbers is not a $F_{\sigma }$ set and also the set of rational numbers is not a $G_{\delta}$ set using Baire theorem. I started with saying that $\mathbb{R}$\ $\mathbb{Q}$ is a $G_{\delta}$ set because $\mathbb{R}$\ $\mathbb{Q}$ = $\bigcap_{ q\in\mathbb{Q}}^{}$$\mathbb{R}$\ {q}. So, if $\mathbb{R}$\ $\mathbb{Q}$ were also $F_{\sigma }$ then $\mathbb{Q}$, as a complementary, would be a $G_{\delta }$ set. Both $\mathbb{R}$\ $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and ($\mathbb{R}$\ $\mathbb{Q}$) $\cup $ $\mathbb{Q}$ = $\mathbb{R}$, so the whole space can be written as a sum of two dense and $G_{\delta }$ sets. I've read that this is a contradiction with Baire theorem, but I can't see this.","['metric-spaces', 'general-topology']"
1321879,Is there a formula for the inverse of Hadamard product?,"Say $A$ and $B$ are two square, positive-semidefinite matrices.

1321905,"When is a binomial coefficient a factorial, i.e. when is $\binom{m}{j} = n!$ for some $n,m,j$?","As stated in the title: when is a binomial coefficient a factorial, i.e. when is $\binom{m}{j} = n!$ for some $m,j,n$? I was thinking about this problem a couple of days ago because in all my years of being a mathematician (amateur or otherwise), I only noticed a handful of these. Of course there are a couple of trivial cases to negate: the case when $n$ arbitrary $m = n!$ and $j=1$, likewise when $m$ arbitrary and $j=0$ and $n=0,1$. I decided to write a Mathematica code to check this for me which I can make available for anyone who is interested. I decided to compute up to $30!$, i.e. $n=30$, and $m$ up to $110$. There were only $3$ binomial coefficients that were factorials (that were not trivial) up to binomial coefficient symmetry: $\dbinom{4}{2} = 6 = 3!$ $\dbinom{10}{3} = 120 = 5!$ $\dbinom{16}{2} = 120 = 5!$ Given how early these occur in the computations, it suggests that there are only finitely many such binomial coefficients - neglecting the trivial cases. Is there anything known in this direction? Are these actually the only ones or are there more lurking out there?","['factorial', 'number-theory', 'binomial-coefficients']"
1321930,Measure of countable union,"In my measure theory class, the professor prove that if $\mu$ is a finite measure on a space $X$ ($\mu(X) < \infty$) and $A_1 \subset A_2 \subset A_3 \subset \cdots$, then  $\lim_{n\to\infty} \mu(A_n)=\mu(\bigcup_{n} A_n)$.

1321973,Is the shortest path in flat hyperbolic space straight relative to Euclidean space?,"I have the following metric
$$
ds^2 = dt^2-dx^2

and I wanted to prove to myself that the shortest path for this metric is straight. I used the following relation $x=f(t)$ and
$$
S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \sqrt{1-[f'(t)]^2} \ dt

If I minimize $S$, I obtain the condition $f''(t)=0$, which implies $x=ct+x_0$, being a straight line in Euclidean space. I have difficulty understanding what it means to minimize hyperbolic path distances, because the square of the distance between two points can be zero or negative. I believe my answer is not correct.

1321988,Is there some relationship between algebraic curves and partial differential equations that goes beyond classifying different PDE's,"I ask primarily because despite not having taken that many math classes (up to two semesters of a PDE class in college), it would be very interesting if maybe we could gain intuition regarding nonlinear PDE's by looking at properties of their algebraic counterparts (i.e, from properties of parabolas for example, we could gain a better understanding of parabolic PDE's). This would extend to looking at other algebraic curves to study many other differential equations, at least, that is what I am thinking. Also, if this actually is a field of research currently, what would be a good way to get into it (books and papers to read, and possible people who are doing this kind of thing to look into)?","['algebraic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"
