2090753,Can a symmetric rank-1 symmetric tensor be written as a linear combination of other symmetric rank-1 symmetric tensors?,"I know that a symmetric tensor of symmetric rank $1$ can be viewed as a point on the so-called Veronese variety . A symmetric tensor of rank $r$ is then in the linear space spanned by $r$ points of the Veronese variety. My question is the following: can any given symmetric tensor of rank $1$ ever reside in the linear space spanned by $r$ other points of the Veronese variety , i.e. be written as a linear combination of $r$ other symmetric rank-$1$ symmetric tensors? I am an engineer, currently working on tensor decompositions for signal processing applications. I'm not very familiar with algebraic geometry, but it seems that I need the answer to the question above, to ensure uniqueness of one such decomposition. I looked for (a hint toward) an answer in the literature on Veronese varieties, but it is rather hard to dig into.","['tensor-rank', 'algebraic-geometry']"
2090781,Solving a differential equation with a factor $2$ in the argument of the unknown function.,"The well-known trig identity $$2\sin(x)\cos(x) = \sin(2x)$$ gives use the differential equation (which I'm not even sure qualifies as an ODE, given the factor in the argument?) $$2f(x)f'(x) = f(2x)$$ Assuming one had no idea that $\sin(x)$ is a solution to this equation, I was wondering if there was a way to derive the solution anyway. My attempt Assume that $f(x)$ has a power series expansion valid for all values of $x$ that we are interested in, that is $$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n$$ for some coefficients $a_n$. Plugging this in gives us $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^na_nx^n=2\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n\right)\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)a_{n+1}x^n\right) \tag1$$ Assuming absolute convergence, we can rewrite the RHS using the Cauchy product formula: \begin{align}
\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n\right)\left(\sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)a_{n+1}x^n\right)&=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{k=0}^n(k+1)a_{k+1}x^ka_{n-k}x^{n-k}\\
&=\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n\sum_{k=0}^n(k+1)a_{k+1}a_{n-k}
\end{align} Plugging this into $(1)$ and comparing coefficients of powers of $x$, we get: $$a_n=2^{1-n}\sum_{k=0}^n(k+1)a_{k+1}a_{n-k}$$ However, I have no idea how to proceed with this recurrence relation for the coefficients of the power series that I am searching for. Therefore, my two questions are: $1.$ Is my approach correct and is there a way to solve this recurrence relation for the known coefficients of the power series expansion of $\sin(x)?$ $2.$ Is there a general approach that is maybe less cumbersome to this kind of problem?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'power-series']"

2090842,How is the differential of a function on a manifold defined if $f(x)$ and $f(x+h)$ cannot be compared?,"I'm self-teaching differential geometry, and a friend perplexed me saying that it's not correct to take a derivative of a function $M \rightarrow \mathbb R$ on a manifold $M$ because the two terms of the difference quotient (say, $f(x)$ and $f(x+h)$ ) lay in different spaces, which just in ordinary calculus are implicitly identified to the same space (the $y$ -axis).
This seemed weird to me because the concept of directional derivative of a function applies regularly to manifolds too...but what if also in this case there's an implicit identification at work?","['derivatives', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
2090850,"When $p$ is an odd prime, is $(p+2)/p$ an outlaw or an index?","Let $\sigma(x)$ denote the sum of the divisors of $x$ , and denote the abundancy index of $x$ as $$I(x) = \dfrac{\sigma(x)}{x},$$ and the deficiency of $x$ as $$D(x) = 2x - \sigma(x).$$ If the equation $I(a)=b/c$ has no solution $a \in \mathbb{N}$ , then $b/c$ is said to be an abundancy outlaw . Statement of the Problem When $p$ is an odd prime, is $(p+2)/p$ an outlaw or an index? Preliminary Results The following lemmas are easy to show: Lemma 1 . If $p$ is an odd prime, and $(p+2)/p$ is the abundancy index of some integer $n$ , then $n$ is deficient. Lemma 2 . If $p$ is odd, then $\gcd(p,p+2)=1$ . Lemma 3 . If $p$ is an odd prime and $I(n) = (p+2)/p$ , then $D(n) = 2n - \sigma(n) \neq 1$ . Lemma 4 . If $p$ is an odd prime and $I(n) = (p+2)/p$ , then $p < n$ . Lemma 5 . If $p$ is an odd prime and $I(n) = (p+2)/p$ , then $\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) \neq 1$ . Remarks In fact, one can show that, if $p$ is an odd prime and $I(n) = (p+2)/p$ , then $$\sigma(n) = \bigg(\dfrac{n}{p}\bigg)\cdot(p+2)$$ and $$n = \bigg(\dfrac{\sigma(n)}{p+2}\bigg)\cdot(p).$$ (Note that $n/p$ and $\sigma(n)/(p+2)$ are (equal) integers because of Lemma 2.) Consequently, we obtain $$\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) = \dfrac{n}{p} = \dfrac{\sigma(n)}{p+2}.$$ (Note further that both $\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) \leq n/3$ and $\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) \leq \sigma(n)/5$ hold.) Added September 16 2017 Given that $X = A/B = C/D$ ( $B \neq 0$ , $D \neq 0$ , and $B \neq D$ ), we can make use of the algebraic identity $$\frac{A}{B}=\frac{C}{D}=\frac{C-A}{D-B}$$ to get another expression for $$\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) = \dfrac{n}{p} = \dfrac{\sigma(n)}{p+2}.$$ Indeed, $$\gcd(n,\sigma(n)) = \dfrac{n}{p} = \dfrac{\sigma(n)}{p+2} = \frac{\sigma(n) - n}{2}.$$ This last finding implies that $$\bigg(\frac{\sigma(n) - n}{2}\bigg) \mid n \iff (\sigma(n) - n) \mid (2n) \iff 2n = (\sigma(n) - n){d_1}$$ and $$\bigg(\frac{\sigma(n) - n}{2}\bigg) \mid \sigma(n) \iff (\sigma(n) - n) \mid (2\sigma(n)) \iff 2\sigma(n) = (\sigma(n) - n){d_2}.$$ Note that $2 \mid (\sigma(n) - n)$ .  Additionally, notice that $$2\gcd\left(n,\sigma(n)\right) = \gcd\left(2n, 2\sigma(n)\right) = \gcd\left((\sigma(n) - n){d_1},(\sigma(n) - n){d_2}\right)$$ $$= \left(\sigma(n) - n\right)\gcd({d_1},{d_2}) \iff \frac{2\gcd\left(n,\sigma(n)\right)}{\left(\sigma(n) - n\right)}=1=\gcd({d_1},{d_2}).$$ In fact, $$d_1 = \frac{2n}{\sigma(n) - n} = p$$ and $$d_2 = \frac{2\sigma(n)}{\sigma(n) - n} = p+2.$$ Double-checking if it is indeed the case that ${d_1}+2={d_2}$ : $$d_1 = \frac{2n}{\sigma(n) - n} + 2 = \frac{2n + 2(\sigma(n) - n)}{\sigma(n) - n} = \frac{2\sigma(n)}{\sigma(n) - n} = d_2.$$ So far so good! More is actually true.  One can also show that $$p(2n - \sigma(n)) = (p - 2)n$$ so that $$D(n) = (p - 2)\cdot\bigg(\dfrac{n}{p}\bigg) = (p - 2)\cdot\bigg(\dfrac{\sigma(n)}{p + 2}\bigg) = (p - 2)\cdot\gcd(n,\sigma(n)).$$ We therefore conclude that $$\dfrac{D(n)}{n} = \dfrac{p - 2}{p} = \bigg(\dfrac{p - 2}{p + 2}\bigg)\cdot{I(n)}.$$ Added October 8 2017 We deduce that $$\dfrac{p-2}{p}=\dfrac{D(n)}{n}<\dfrac{\phi(n)}{n}<\dfrac{n}{\sigma(n)}=\dfrac{p}{p+2},$$ whence there is still no contradiction. Motivation It is conjectured that $(p+2)/p$ is an outlaw, since if it were an index, then we would be able to produce an odd perfect number for $p=3$ . Here is my question: To what extent can the following theorem be improved to hopefully produce some results towards proving the aforementioned conjecture? Theorem If $n$ is a positive integer satisfying $D(n) = 2n - \sigma(n) > 1$ , then we have the following bounds for the abundancy of $n$ in terms of the deficiency of $n$ : $$\dfrac{2n}{n + D(n)} < I(n) < \dfrac{2n + D(n)}{n + D(n)}.$$","['conjectures', 'perfect-numbers', 'number-theory', 'divisor-sum', 'elementary-number-theory']"

2090865,Simple Modules and Ideals,"It is pretty routine to show that every simple left $R$-module is cyclically generated by any nonzero element and that these simple modules are precisely of the form $R/I$, where $I$ is some maximal ideal. My question is what happens when you start to 'stitch' these together: let $S_1,S_2$ are distinct (in that they are not isomorphic) simple left $R$-modules. Then these are of the form $R/I, R/J$, where $I,J$ are maximal left ideals, respectively. My thought it is that $S_1 \oplus S_2 \cong R/(I \cap J)$. This makes since in that if $R$ were semisimple, then it is a sum of simple modules and its jacobson radical (the intersection of all maximal left ideals) is zero. Then extending my idea above, $I \cap J$ does seem to be the correct ideal. But I am unable to prove this. My idea was to define a surjective map $\phi: R \to R/I \times R/J$ and use the first isomorphism theorem but the only obvious map is $r \mapsto (r,r)$ and its not clear that is surjective. [For a bit I thought it wouldn't be but perhaps it, non-obviously is?] I could go the other way, $\psi: R/I \times R/J \to R/(I \cap J)$ via $(r,s) \mapsto rs+I\cap J$ (easy enough to show this is well-defined since this vanishes on $I \cap J$). This map is pretty clearly surjective. But injective? If $(r,s)$ were to map to zero, then $rs \in I \cap J$. But beyond that I'm not sure where to go with this. If the ring were commutative, I would have more since maximal implies prime and this would be something. (since this doesn't work, I'm really out of ideas) Any ideas on how to prove this or can $S_1 \oplus S_2$ not be represented this way?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'modules']"

I am at a larger state school and the audience is primarily first year college students or students taking math again for the first time in a couple of years, so ideally examples shouldn't be esoteric and require a lot of knowledge of mathematics; so things such as $$ \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin(h)}{h} = 1$$

2091150,"Have ""algebraic angles"" been studied before?","I'm writing a geometric software library and I came up with a useful concept. Let's call a real number $\alpha$ an algebraic angle if $\alpha\in[0,2\pi)$ and $\cos \alpha$ is an algebraic number. The set of algebraic angles has some pretty neat properties: The sine, cosine, and tangent of an algebraic angle are algebraic. Define negation and addition of angles the usual way, wrapping around at $2\pi$. Then algebraic angles are closed under negation and addition (since $\cos(\alpha+\beta)=\cos\alpha\cos\beta-\sin\alpha\sin\beta$). Define multiplication of an algebraic angle by a rational number to also wrap around at $2\pi$. Multiplying an algebraic angle by a rational yields another algebraic angle! This can be proved from the identity $\cos(n\alpha)=T_n(\cos\alpha)$, which I learned about here . $T_n$ is a Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind . In particular, it is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Since $\pi$ is an algebraic angle, so is any rational multiple of $\pi$ in $[0,2\pi)$. Algebraic angles are a vector space over the rationals (I haven't proved anything interesting using this fact though). They're not a vector space because $x(y\alpha)$ is not necessarily equal to $(xy)\alpha$. For example, $(1/2)(2\cdot\pi)$ is $0$ but $(1/2\cdot 2)\pi$ is $\pi$. Has the set of algebraic angles appeared in academic literature? Individual algebraic angles come up everywhere in geometry: for example, the interior angle between two faces of a regular dodecahedron is $\arccos(-\frac{1}{5}\sqrt{5})$. Let me elaborate on why an algebraic angle divided by an integer yields an algebraic angle: Suppose that $\cos\alpha$ is algebraic, so that there is some polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients such that $P(\cos\alpha)=0$. Let $n$ be a positive integer. By the Chebyshev identity above, $P(T_n(\cos(\alpha/n)))=0$, so $\cos(\alpha/n)$ is algebraic. Edited 2017-01-10: Ok, after reading some of the answers and comments I realized that the interesting properties of algebraic angles become obvious if you consider how they transform under $\alpha\mapsto e^{i\alpha}$. The algebraic angles become algebraic points on the unit circle, angle negation becomes complex conjugation, angle addition becomes complex multiplication, and multiplying by a rational essentially becomes raising to a rational power. It's clear that algebraicity is preserved by each of these operations.","['reference-request', 'angle', 'geometry']"

My question is whethere the ""topologist's sine curve"" defined as $S = \{(0, y) : y \in (-1,1)\} \cup \{(x, \sin (1/x)) : x \in (0, 2/\pi)\}$ can be a manifold. I tried to find some explnations in books and web. However, what I found are all about (path/local) connectedness. I'm not familiar with topology and not want to study it extensively. So I tried to understand the question with very minimal knowledge. As far as I understand, to say that a set is a manifold, I need to set a topology (open subsets) on the set. As a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, every open set in $S$ should have a form $S \cap A$ for an open set $A \in \mathbb{R}^2$. Any interval in the vertical axis part of $S$, e.g. $I = \{(0, y) : 0 < y < 1/2\}$, cannot be an open set in $S$. It is because every open set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ containing $I$ also contains some other part of $S$ : there is no way to express $I$ in the form of $S \cap A$ where $A$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then there is no homeomorphism from an open subset of $S$ containing $I$ to an open set in $\mathbb{R}$. It is because, if there is one, the preimage of an open interval in $\mathbb{R}$, to which $I$ is mapped, must be open but $I$ is not open. So there cannot be a coordinate chart for $I$ and $S$ is not a manifold. This is what I understand. My first question is whether or not this understanding is correct. The second question is whether $S$ can be a manifold if I give a different topology. I cannot express precisly how to define the topology but intuitively the sine function part is homeomorphic to an open interval in the real line and the vertical part is also homeomorphic to an open interval in the real line, if I consider $S$ as a space of its own, not a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Is this true? If true, how can I express the topology precisley? This question is not a duplicate of Topologist's Sine Curve not a regular submanifold of $\mathbb{R^2}$? .
I read it. However, the concept of connectedness confuses me. As I said in the first paragraph, I want to understand my question with minimal knowledge on topology such as just the definition of open sets, continuous functions and manifolds. Moreover the linked question does not concern my second question.","['manifolds', 'general-topology']"
2091412,Probability of selecting a ball from a box.,"Suppose we have $12$ identical balls. Think of the balls as having distinct ID numbers, $1-12$ . We have $3$ identical boxes, each of which can contain exactly $4$ balls. One after the other the balls are thrown at random into one of the three boxes. Suppose Mr. A will buy one ball from each box, so he will buy a total of three balls from the three boxes. Habit of Mr. A is to buy that ball from the box which ID is smallest of all other balls in that box. For example, the randomly thrown balls in a box have ID $4$ , $8$ , $9$ , and $12$ . So Mr. A will buy the ball with ID $4$ from that box. Then Mr. A goes to another box and here the balls have ID $1$ , $3$ , $6$ , and $11$ . He will buy the ball with ID $1$ from that box. At last, Mr. A goes to the last box and here the balls have ID $2$ , $5$ , $7$ , and $10$ . He will buy the ball with ID $2$ from that box. My question is: What is the probability that Mr. A will buy the ball with ID $i$ , where $i=1,2,\ldots,12$ ? What I think is that we need to consider the following two things to calculate the probability: $(1)$ the position of a ball in the box. Mr. A will buy the ball with ID number $2$ if and only if the box does not contain the ball with ID number $1$ . $(2)$ If Mr. A buy a ball with smallest ID from the first box in front of him, then are there $11$ balls remaining to buy another two balls or are there $8$ balls (excluding all $4$ balls from the first box)?","['probability', 'order-statistics']"

For a party to win the election overall but lose the popular vote, it must win exactly 2 votes in 2 seats, and 0 votes in the third seat.
The number of ways this could happen is 2 (parties which could win overall) * 3 (seats in which the winning party could get 0 votes) * 3 (electors which could vote against the winning party in the first seat won by them) * 3 (electors which could vote against the winning party in the second seat won by them).

  among the boxes given by the configuration $[n_1, n_2, ..., n_M]$ is
  given by $$\frac{N!}{\prod_{j=1}^M (n_j)!}\tag{1}$$ 
  In the most likely configuration there are $$n_0 = \frac{N}{M}$$ particles in each box. Let $\Omega_0$ denote the statistical weight of this configuration and $p_0$ its probability. Now consider moving $\delta n$ particles from box $1$ to box $2$, giving the new configuration
  $$[n_0 − δn, n_0 + δn, n_0, n_0, ..., n_0]$$
  Show that $$\fbox{$\color{blue}{\delta\left(\ln\Omega_{\{n\}}\right)\approx -\delta n\ln (n_0)-\frac{(\delta n)^2}{2 n_0}}$}$$
  (Hint: you should use Stirling’s approximation here) The image below shows the situation: Here is the answer as written by the author: This might be a bit hard to read so I have typed it out word for word below: $$\ln\Omega_{\{n\}}=\ln(N!)-\sum_j\ln (n_j!)$$
  The change in $\ln\Omega$ due to a change $\delta n$ in ONE box is
  $$\delta(\ln\Omega_{\{n\}})=-\ln([n_0+\delta_n]!)+\ln(n_0!)$$
  Taylor expand $\ln (n!)$ $\color{red}{\text{(To second 2nd order since we are already at a maximum for}}$ $\color{red}{\ln\Omega_{\{n\}}}$$\color{red}{)}$ using Stirling:
  $$\ln (n!)\approx \underbrace{n_0\ln (n_0)-n_0}_{0th}+\underbrace{\ln (n_0)\cdot\delta_n}_{1st}+\underbrace{\frac{(\delta n)^2}{2n_0}}_{2nd}+\cdots$$
  $$\implies \delta(\ln\Omega_{\{n\}})=-\ln (n_0)\cdot\delta n-\frac{(\delta n)^2}{2n_0}$$ The red bracket can be ignored as it was just used in the previous part of the question where we had to show that $$n_0=\frac{N}{M}$$ is the most likely configuration which we did my differentiating and setting to zero to maximize. Finally I get to my question: I understand everything up to the point where it says ""Taylor expand $\ln n!$"", firstly where on earth is $n$ even defined? I see $n_0$ and $N$ but not $n$. I can only assume that the author meant 'Taylor expand $\ln([n_0+\delta_n]!)$' since I fail to see how that expression could ever get the factors $n_0$ and $\delta_n$. I know that the general Taylor expansion formula is given by 
$$f(a)+\frac {f'(a)}{1!} (x-a)+ \frac{f''(a)}{2!} (x-a)^2+\frac{f^{(3)}(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3+ \cdots$$ and that Stirlings approximation is as follows
$$\ln(k!)\approx k\ln k - k +\frac12\ln k$$ I have used both these formulae, but not both together. I'm very confused about how to proceed with this, so I naively apply Stirlings approximation first: $$\ln([n+\delta n]!)\approx (n+\delta n)\ln(n+\delta n)-(n+\delta n)+\frac12\ln(n+\delta n)$$ But now I am completely stuck. Could someone please explain how the author was able to reach the result? EDIT: A comment below raised an important point. So I will just mention that for the purposes of this question the statistical weight $\Omega$ is equal to the number of microstates . EDIT#2: I must apologize there was a contradiction in my question due to a typo. What I needed to show was that $$\fbox{$\color{blue}{\delta\left(\ln\Omega_{\{n\}}\right)\approx -\delta n\ln (n_0)-\frac{(\delta n^2)}{2 n_0}}$}$$ and this is given in blue in the first quotation box, very sorry about this. EDIT#3: I acknowledge that those of you that answered actually figured out that there must be a similar expression when considering both boxes. So as promised here is part 2 of the question as written by the author: I'll type it word for word again anyway just in case it's hard to read: For a change to TWO boxes, moving $\delta n$ from $1$ to $2$,
  $$\delta\left(\ln\Omega_{\{n\}}\right)=-\ln (n_0)\cdot(-\delta n)-\frac{\left(-\delta n\right)^2}{2n_0}$$

Maybe one of you can help me finding out. First of all let us assume that in this scenario all premises of the Poincaré lemma are met. We discussed the first theorem of thermodynamics and some applications:
$$dU=\delta Q +\delta W.$$
Where '$d$' denotes an exact differential form and $'\delta'$ denotes an inexact one. Using the state equation $pV = nRT$ of an ideal gas and the definition of the work differential for ideal gases $\delta W = -pdV$ we derived this thing : $$\frac{\delta W}{dp}=-dV.$$ Physically speaking I understand what this equation means. However, mathematically I do not understand what the left-hand side actually means. Also, given a differential form like $\delta Q=c_V\cdot dT$ one can calculate $\frac{\delta Q}{dp}=c_V\cdot\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial p}\right)_V$. Our professor said that this quotient is not a derivative but a difference quotient. But then I don't understand how in the second case this difference quotient comes out to be a partial derivative anyway. I suppose it has to do with the fact that path integrals of inexact differential forms are path-dependent. However, as opposed to difference quotients of exact differentials I cannot imagine how to define a difference quotient of an inexact differential since those don't have an anti-derivative.","['derivatives', 'partial-derivative', 'differential', 'differential-forms']"
2091649,"If $f$ is continuous and $f(A)$ is open, is $A$ necessarily open?","In the context of general topology, a function is said to be continuous if the pre-image of any open subset is also an open subset. Of course, this does not say that the image of an open set must be an open set (and in fact, this is not true in general). But, what about the statement ""all sets whose image is open must be open"" ? This is a different statement, and I don't know what to think of it intuitively. My thoughts: Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and let $f : X \to Y$ continuous. Let $A$ be a set such that $f(A)$ is open. I am trying to decide whether or not $A$ is necessarily open. I know from set theory that $A \subseteq f^{-1}(f(A))$, and the fact that it is not an equality is very important (if this was an equality, the statement would be immediately true). With this, I am able to conclude that $A$ is a subset of the open set $f^{-1}(f(A))$, and apparently I can't conclude anything better. With this in mind, it seems to me that the statement is probably false, but I was unable to find any counterexample either.","['continuity', 'general-topology']"

The theorem is as follows: Assume a domain $U$ is bounded and that $\partial U$ is $C^1$. Then there exists a bounded linear operator $$T: W^{1,p}(U) \to L^p(\partial U)$$
such that i) $Tu = u|_{\partial U}$ if $u \in W^{1,p}(U) \cap C(\overline{U}) $ ii) $||Tu||_{L^p(\partial U)} \le C ||u||_{W^{1,p}(U)}$ for each $u \in W^{1,p}(U)$, with $C$ depending only on $p$ and $U$. I get that if $u$ is continuous we have already have a definition of $u$ on the boundary and this leads to i). I don't see what is meant by ii) though. I read it as 'for any $u \in W^{1, p}$, the size of $T$ acting on $u$ in $L^p$ over the boundary $\partial U$ will always be less than or equal to a constant times the size of $u$ in $W^{1, p}$ over the entire domain $U$'. How is this useful, we haven't even given an explicit definition of $T$, we have only made a statement about its size? We are relating norms over different domains ($\partial U$ and $U$), this seems like a meaningless thing to do..so why do we do it? Furthermore, what is the relevance of $||Tu||_{L^p(\partial U)}$ being less than or equal to a constant times $||u||_{W^{1,p}(U)}$?

In what follows, let $\mathrm{BC}(X)$ denote the set of bounded, continuous real-valued functions on $X$. Define a topology $\upsilon$ on $\mathcal P$ as the one generated by the topological subbasis consisting of sets of the form $$U_{f,y,\varepsilon}\equiv\left\{\mathbb P\in\mathcal P:\left|\int_{x\in X}f(x)\,\mathrm d\mathbb P(x)-y\right|<\varepsilon\right\},\quad\text{where } f\in\mathrm{BC}(X),\,y\in\mathbb R,\,\varepsilon>0.$$ The topology $\upsilon$ is often referred to as the weak-star topology , given the functional-analytic structure with which $\mathcal P$ can be endowed (see also below). It is not difficult to check that a net $(\mathbb P_{\alpha})_{\alpha\in A}$ in $\mathcal P$ (where $A$ is a non-empty directed index set) converges to $\mathbb P\in\mathcal P$ with respect to this topology if and only if the corresponding net $$\left(\int_{x\in X}f(x)\,\mathrm d\mathbb P_{\alpha}(x)\right)_{\alpha\in A}$$ of real numbers converges to $\int_{x\in X}f(x)\,\mathrm d\mathbb P(x)$ with respect to the Euclidean topology on $\mathbb R$ for every fixed $f\in\mathrm{BC}(X)$. It is quite well-known from functional-analytic probability theory that if $(X,\tau)$ is metrizable and compact, then $(\mathcal P,\upsilon)$ is compact. [And I think, although I am not 100% sure, that the Riesz representation theorem ensures the compactness of $(\mathcal P,\upsilon)$ if $(X,\tau)$ is compact and merely Hausdorff, and not necessarily metrizable.] What I am trying to do is establish the compactness of $(\mathcal P,\upsilon)$ using only the compactness of the underlying space $(X,\tau)$, using no further topological separation or countability axioms: Conjecture: If $(X,\tau)$ is compact, then so is $(\mathcal P,\upsilon)$. Naturally, the applicability of the usual functional-analytic toolkit (such as the Riesz representation theorem) is quite limited without further assumptions. I was thinking of using Alexander’s subbasis theorem as a starting point, but I am actually not even sure that the conjecture is true in its general form. Any hints, references for proofs (if true), or outlines of counterexamples (if false) would be greatly appreciated.","['functional-analysis', 'general-topology', 'measure-theory', 'probability-theory']"

Here are a few remarks: Since $x\mapsto \frac{2^x}{x}$ is increasing when $x\geq 2$, one might be tempted to use the integral test. This fails: when doing so, one gets $a_n\leq \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2^k}{k}\leq b_n$ where $a_n\sim \frac{2^n}{\ln (2)n}$ and $b_n\sim \frac{2^{n+1}}{\ln (2)n}$. 
Unfortunately $b_n$ is too big and this estimate doesn't yield the limit. Here's my solution: since it's easy to sum $2^k$ and the difference $\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k+1}$ is small, it's natural to try summation by parts: $$\begin{align} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2^k}{k}
&=\frac{S_n}{n+1}-1+\sum_{k=1}^n S_k \left(\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k+1} \right)\quad \text{where} \; S_n=\sum_{k=0}^n 2^k\\

\end{align}$$ Intuition suggests $\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2^{k+1}}{k(k+1)}=o\left(\frac{2^n}n \right)$ but it's not immediate to prove. I had to resort to another summation by parts! Indeed 
$$\begin{align}\small\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2^{k+1}}{k(k+1)}&= \small 2\left[ \frac{2^{n+1}}{n(n+1)} + 2\sum_{k=1}^n \left(\frac{2^{k+1}}{k(k+1)(k+2)}\right)-\frac 12 -2\sum_{k=1}^n \left(\frac{1}{k(k+1)(k+2)}\right) - \frac{1}{n(n+1)}\right]\\

That is, its minimum value should be the smallest, and its maximum value should be the largest, given the limits of the other two variables in the old order. But I have an integral where this rule isn't so clear: I should change this integral: $$\int_{0}^{1}dx\int_{0}^{1-x}dy\int_{0}^{x+y}f(x,y,z)dz$$ to this integral: $$\int dz\int dx\int f(x,y,z)dy$$ with matching limits of integration. Since $z$ is the outermost variable in the new order, let's start with finding its maximal domain. There are two options. Since $0\leq z\leq x+y$ and $0\leq y\leq 1-x$ , we have $x\leq y+x \leq 1$ so $0\leq z \leq 1$ . Since $0\leq x\leq 1$ and $0\leq y\leq 1-x$ , we have $0\leq y\leq 1$ and so $0\leq z\leq 2$ . I think option $1$ is correct, since we are interested in the maximal value of $x+y$ , which is given by $1$ in the corresponding inequality. Now, next: I need to find the limits of integration of $x$ . Given a constant $z$ , we get $z-y\leq x\leq 1-y$ (by the two relevant inequalities). But we want only $z$ to be in this inequality. So we have $z-x \leq y\leq 1-x$ , and plugging that in gives $z+x-1 \leq x \leq 1+x-z$ , which gives $z-1\leq 0\leq 1-z$ , and $x$ is eliminated. How do I get around that? (without having to draw the domain) Any hint, tip or general approach would be greatly apreciated.","['multivariable-calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals']"

2092400,Extremely lost and confused on how to apply law of total variance on problem,"I am a bit confused on the concept of conditioning and finding the new distribution of conditioned random variables. An example, Suppose that there is a new carnival in town and that citizens will begin to line up outside at $10:00$ am. Further suppose that the arrivals are independent, and that the number that arrive in any 1 minute interval is Poisson distributed with $\lambda=3$. Now suppose the owners will check on the line $T$ minutes after people begin to show up, where $T$ is binomial distributed with $n=20$ and $p=0.8$, then find the expected number of citizens in the line when it is checked and the standard deviation. What I tried: I know the law of double expectation and variance the first is that $E[P]=E[E(P\mid T)]$ and $Var(P)=E[Var(P\mid T)]+Var[E(P\mid T)]$ which I could find standard deviation from. I know that $E(T)=np=16$ and $E(P)=\lambda=3 $ If I had to give an answer without being confident, I would say that the expected number of customers would be 48 So I know that $E(C|T)$  ( I now think it is $3T$) should be a random variable, how do I find its distribution? What about in general to find the distribution of conditional expectation? I am having some trouble on the second part and this is why, to use the formula I listed for variance above I want to calculated $Var(P|T)$ , I thought this would be equal to $E(P^2|T)-(E(P|T))^{2}$ which would give me $9T-9T^{2}$, which has an expected value of $-2188.8$, adding this to the variance of the expected value $( 28.8)$ still leaves a very negative number which I know cannot be the case. so I must have a mistake somewhere. Here I also used that we know the variance of binomial to be npq , which in this case is =3.2 and used this to solve for $E(M^2)$ I have tried over and over now but cant figure out where and why I am not getting an answer that makes sense. Still confused, is really no one willing to help clarify this at all??

In a similar fashion as the Dirichlet $\eta$-function, I started to experiment with: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\mu(2n-1)}{(2n-1)^s}-\frac{\mu(2n)}{(2n)^s}\right)$$ and found that the following also seems to hold true: $$\frac 1{\zeta(s)}=\frac{2^s-1}{2^s+1}\cdot\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{\mu(2n-1)}{(2n-1)^s}-\frac{\mu(2n)}{(2n)^s}\right)$$ where $\frac{2^s-1}{2^s+1}$ could also be written as $\tanh\left(\frac{s\ln(2)}{2}\,\right)$.

2092456,Spline interpolation in SE(3),"Given: a sequence ${A_i}_{i=1}^n$ of elements of the special Euclidean group, $SE(3)$; a sequence of times ${t_i}_{i=1}^n$, where $t_1 \leq t_2 \leq ... \leq t_n$; instantaneous body frame velocity given by a twist $v\in se(3)$ at time $t_1$ instantaneous body frame acceleration $\alpha$ at time $t_1$ I would like to find an interpolating curve $f(t) \in SE(3)$ that is twice differentiable such that $f(t_i) = A_i$ and $f'(t_1) = v$ and $f''(t_1) = \alpha$. One approach, as suggested by [1], is: Compute $\xi_1, ..., \xi_n \in se(3)$ where $\xi_i = \log(A_1^{-1} A_i)$. Compute an interpolating curve (e.g. using a B-spline) $\gamma(t)$ in Euclidean space $\mathbb R^6$ such that $\gamma(t_i) = \xi_i$. Then, the interpolating curve is $f(t) = A_1 \exp(\gamma(t))$. Unfortunately, this doesn't work well in most places except for a small neighbourhood around $A_1$, because $\exp$ i s a surjective map from $se(3)$ to $SE(3)$. For example, if we interpret the angular part of $\xi$ as an axis-angle representation in $so(3)$, you can flip the sign on the axis and replace the angle $\theta$ with $2\pi - \theta$ and it would represent the same element in $SO(3)$. As a consequence, if some elements $A_i$, $A_{i+1}$ happen to be close together in $SE(3)$ but cross over the $\pi$ threshold, $\xi_i$ and $\xi_{i+1}$ may not be close together in $\mathbb R^6$ and the interpolating curve may take an additional rotation than what would be ""natural"". An alternative is to interpolate separately in rotation and translation. However, most rotation formalisms fail in some case. For example, Gibbs vectors (used by [2]) suffer from the drawback that $180^\circ$ rotations cannot be represented. Quaternions (used by [3]) also have a sign ambiguity, so two elements close together in $SO(3)$ are also not guaranteed to be close in quaternion space. Also, an interpolating function in $\mathbb R^4$ may not be normalized in general, and may become singular if it passes through zero (though it is unlikely). I have no idea how the authors in the cited papers overcome these issues. Besides, using the exponential map is most natural when dealing with nonlinear optimization on the manifold, since the derivatives are easy to compute.
