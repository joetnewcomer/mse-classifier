1985964,Christoffel Symbols for Spherical Polar Coordinates,"If we are given a line element; $$ds^2=dr^2+r^2d\theta^2+r^2sin^2\theta d\varphi^2$$ We can easily then see that the metric and the inverse metric are; $$g=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&r^2&0\\0&0&r^2sin^2\theta\\\end{pmatrix}$$ $$g^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\0&r^{-2}&0\\0&0&r^{-2}(\sin\theta)^{-2}\\\end{pmatrix} $$ I have used the formula; $$\Gamma^m_{ij}=\frac12 g^{ml}(\partial_jg_{il}+\partial_ig_{lj}-\partial_lg_{ji} )$$ Where upper indices indictate the inverse matrix to calculate my Christoffel symbols.

I notice that the article uses the labelling convention $\{r,\varphi,\theta\}$ , whereas I have used $\{r,\theta,\varphi\}$ (which is annoying, since the article uses my preferred notation which I have made a conscious effort to move away from due to none of my professors using it), and was wondering whether or not I made a fundamental mistake, or if the different labeling systems could account for the discrepancy.

1985968,"Measures that coincide on every $(a,b)$ are equal","From Bass, Real Analysis for Graduate Students : Suppose $X$ is the set of real numbers, $\mathcal B$ the Borel $\sigma$-algebra and $m$ and $n$ are two measures on $(X,\mathcal B)$ such that $m((a,b))=n((a,b))<\infty$ whenever $-\infty<a<b<\infty$. Prove that $m(A)=n(A)$ whenever $A\in \mathcal B$. I'm thinking the $\pi-\lambda$ theorem comes in handy in this situation. I'm therefore inclined to let $\mathcal C = \{(a,b), a<b\}$ and $\mathcal D = \{A\in \mathcal B, m(A)=n(A)\}$. $C$ is obviously a $\pi$-system, and I expect $\mathcal D$ to be a Dynkin system (also referred to as $\lambda$-system).
It's easy to prove that $\mathbb R\in \mathcal D$ and $\mathcal D$ is closed under increasing union. Nonetheless, I'm running into some trouble when attempting to prove that $\mathcal D$ is stable under complement... Indeed, given $A,B$ in $\mathcal D$ such that $A\subset B$ , the following holds: $m(B) = m(B\setminus A) + m(A)$, hence $n(B) = m(B\setminus A)+n(A)$. But similarly, $n(B) = n(B\setminus A) + n(A)$. Hence $m(B\setminus A)+n(A) = n(B\setminus A) + n(A)$ The problem is, $1+\infty = 2+\infty $, yet $1\neq 2$. I cannot derive $m(B\setminus A) = n(B\setminus A)$ unless $n(A)<\infty$, which may not be true... Note that I haven't used finitess of $n$ and $m$ on $(a,b)$ yet ... Any help is much appreciated.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1986031,"What are $R_p$ and ""a natural map"" $R_f\rightarrow R_p$ in Mumford's Red Book?","Let $R$ be a ring, $X=\operatorname{Spec}R$, and write $X_f$ for $X\setminus V(f)$. We know that $X_g\subset X_f$ iff $g\in \sqrt{(f)}$ iff $g^n=fh$ for some $n \in  \mathbb{N}$ and $h\in R$. So there is a well-defined map $R_f\rightarrow R_g$ given by $\frac{a}{f^m}\mapsto\frac{ah^m}{g^{nm}}$ whenever $X_g\subset X_f$. Here $R_f$ stands for the localization of $R$ w.r.t. $\{f,f^2,\dots\}$. In his Red book, Mumford writes the following: If $[P]\in X_f$, then $f\notin P$ and there is a natural map
  $R_f\rightarrow R_p$, since the multiplicative system $R-P$ contains
  the multiplicative system $\{f,f^2,\dots\}$. I don't get what this small $p$ (or more generally $R_p$) stands for. First I naively thought that $R_p$ is just $R_P$, the localization of $R$ at the prime ideal $P$, but then realized that this makes no sense because the the existence of a map $R_f\rightarrow R_p$ assumes that $X_p\subset X_f$, which is of course true, but if $p=P$, then on trying to verify that this map is well-defined, one has to use $p\in\sqrt{(f)}$, which is nonsense in the case $p=P$.

Geometric averages occur in inequalities frequently, not least after homogenizing. So I wonder if there is a general inequality like the one asked here. If it's known in the literature, a reference would of course be fine (I couldn't find any).

1986300,"Clarifying the proof of Theorem 5 in Pratulananda Das's ""Some further results on ideal convergence in topological spaces""","The proof of theorem 5 of Some further results on ideal convergence in topological spaces by Pratulananda Das is unclear to me. Theorem 5. For any sequence $x = (x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ in a hereditarily Lindelöf space $X$, there exists a sequence $y = (y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ in $X$ such that $\{n \in\Bbb N: x_n \neq y_n\} \in \mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{I}(C_x) = L(y)$ provided $\mathcal{I}$ satisfies the condition $(AP)$ or in other words is a $P$-ideal. Proof. The proof is finished if $\mathcal{I}(C_x) = L(x)$. How so? It only gives that $I(C_y)=L(y)$. How do we know $L(x)=L(y)$? If not then $\mathcal{I}(C_x)\nsubseteq L(x)$. $\mathcal{I}(C_x)\neq L(x)$ if either or both of $\mathcal{I}(C_x)\subset L(x)$ and $L(x)\subset \mathcal{I}(C_x)$ does not hold. So maybe $\mathcal{I}(C_x)\nsubseteq L(x)$ or $L(x)\nsubseteq \mathcal{I}(C_x)$. How does he know it's the first one? For each $z ∈ L(x)\setminus \mathcal{I}(C_x)$ we can find an open set $U_z$ containing $z$ such that $\{n \in \mathbb N: x_n \in U_z\} \in \mathcal{I}$. Even if $\mathcal{I}(C_x)\nsubseteq L(x)$, how can we say $z\in L(x)\setminus\mathcal{I}(C_x)$? Because $\mathcal{I}(C_x)\nsubseteq L(x)\implies \mathcal{I}(C_x)\setminus L(x)\neq \varnothing$ and not $L(x)\setminus\mathcal{I}(C_x)\neq \varnothing$ because $\mathcal{I}(C_x)\nsubseteq L(x)$ holds when $\mathcal{I}(C_x)$ is a proper superset of $L(x)$ and in that case $L(x)\setminus\mathcal{I}(C_x)=\varnothing$ and we shall find no $z\in L(x)\setminus\mathcal{I}(C_x)$ Now $\{U_z: z \in L(x)\setminus \mathcal{I}(C_x)\}$ forms an open cover of $L(x)\setminus\mathcal{I}(C_x)$ and so it has a countable subcover $\{U_{z_i}: i \in \mathbb N\}$ (say). Put $A_i = \{n \in \mathbb N: x_n \in U_{z_i}\}$. Then $(A_i)$ is a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{I}$ and since $\mathcal{I}$ has property (AP), there exists an $A \in\mathcal I$ such that $A_i\setminus A$ is finite for each $i$. If $\mathbb N\setminus A = \{k_n: n \in \mathbb N\}$, then construct $y = (y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ as
  follows: $$\begin{cases}
y_n=x_{k_n}&\text{if }n\in A,\\
y_n=x_n&\text{if }n\notin A.
\end{cases}$$ Clearly then $\{n \in \mathbb N: x_n \neq y_n\} \subset A$ and so belongs to $\mathcal I$. By Theorem 4 we have $\mathcal{I}(C_x) = \mathcal{I}(C_y)$. But note that the subsequence $(x_{k_n} )$ of $(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ has no accumulation point in $L(x)\setminus \mathcal{I}(C_x)$ and so has no $\mathcal{I}$-limit point of $(y_n)$ (since $\mathcal I$ is admissible). I cannot see at all how it follows that if the subsequence $(x_{k_n} )$ of $(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ has no accumulation point in $L(x)\setminus \mathcal{I}(C_x)$, then it has no $\mathcal{I}$-limit point of $(y_n)$. So $L(y) = \mathcal{I}(C_y)$ and consequently we have $L(y) = \mathcal{I}(C_x)$. $\square$ Necessary definitions and statements In the following $X$ is a topological space, $\mathcal{I}$ is an ideal on $\mathbb N$, $x = (x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ is a sequence in $X$. $y \in X$ is called an $\mathcal{I}$-limit point of $x$ if there is a strictly increasing sequence $( m_k )_{k \in \mathbb N}$ in $\mathbb N$ such that $\{ m_k : k \in \mathbb N \} \notin \mathcal{I}$ and $\lim_{k \to \infty} x_{m_k} = y$. $y \in X$ is called an $\mathcal{I}$-cluster point of $x$ if for every open set $U$ containing $y$, $\{n \in N: x_n \in U\}\notin\mathcal{I}$. And the collection of all $\mathcal{I}$-cluster points of $X$ is denoted by $\mathcal{I}(C_x)$. $z\in L(x)$ if for each neighborhood $W$ of $z$, $\{n \in \mathbb N: x_n \in W \}$ is infinite (i.e., $L(x)$ is the set of all cluster points of $x$). $\mathcal{I}$ has property (AP) (or is a P-ideal ) if for every sequence $( A_n )_{n \in \mathbb N}$ in $\mathcal I$ there exists an $A_\infty \in \mathcal I$ such that $A_n \setminus A_\infty$ is a finite set for every $n \in \mathbb N$. $\mathcal{I}$ is admissible (or free ) if it contains all singletons.

1986526,Moving bricks into piles,"Suppose we have $k$ piles, into which we would like to distribute $n$ bricks. Initially, all $n$ bricks are stacked in pile $1$.  A move consists of moving one brick from pile $i$ to pile $j$, $1\le i,j\le k$. A move is valid only if
$$ |i| > |j|+1 $$
where $|\cdot|$ denotes the number of bricks in the pile. So to put the validity condition another way, a move is valid only when pile $i$ has at least as many bricks as pile $j$, both before and after the move. Let $\phi(n,k)$ be the maximum number of valid moves that can be made (before the piles ""stabilize""). It is easy to code up a dynamic programming algorithm to compute $\phi(n,k)$.  My question is if there is a more direct way to compute it. Note that for $k>n$, $\phi(n,k) = \phi(n,n)$. So we can arrange the values $\phi(n,k)$ in a Pascal-like triangle,

I got this conclusion just by analyzing the graph of the function, but I'd appreciate is some of you can point out a way to reach this conclusion by applying the definition either of derivative or that of differential or by a more ''formal'' approach.

Edit: the original claim (with linear dependence on $\epsilon$) is false; see this blog post by Terry Tao. Basically he constructs matrices $A$ and $B$ such that $\lVert B \rVert < \epsilon$, the spectrum of $A$ is all zeroes, but the eigenvalues of $A + B$ are the $n$th roots of $\epsilon$ (where $n$ is the dimensionality).

Edit: The accepted answer said it best: Obviously three hexagons sharing a common vertex cannot be perfectly regular, otherwise the surface would be flat in a neighbourhood of the common vertex! So it's quite a bummer. We cannot have arbitrarily large number of hexagons if we want them to be regular hexagons. Looks like the closest with can get is the soccer ball shape (truncated icosahedron), which actually only has two hexagons meeting at a vertex, not three, so they can be regular.","['polyhedra', 'geometry']"

Let the correlation between two subsets $x,y$ of $[n]$ be the number $\kappa(x,y) = 1 - \frac{2}{n}|x\triangle y|$ with $x\triangle y$ the symmetric difference between $x$ and $y$ . $\kappa$ measures how strongly $x, y$ do agree in terms of their members and non-members, from $\kappa=1$ for $x=y$ to $\kappa=-1$ when $x$ and $y$ are complements of each other. When $|x\triangle y|=n/2$ the sets $x,y$ are uncorrelated, $\kappa = 0$ . Question I wonder how, why and under which circumstances it is possible to literally see the symmetries of a structure (or at least some of them), and how to interpret systematically what is seen. As a non-trivial example consider the correlation graph $(V,E)$ of the powerset $P([8]) =: V$ where $(x,y)\in E$ when $\kappa(x,y) \neq 0$ . Some symmetries of this graph are due to the fact that for every permutation $\pi$ of $\{0,\dots,7\}$ it holds that $\kappa(x,y) =  \kappa(\pi(x),\pi(y))$ . Further, the graph is invariant against complements, since $\kappa(x,y) =  \kappa(\overline{x},\overline{y})$ Many more symmetries can be seen in one of the 256x256 adjacency matrices of the graph: To see some kind of translational symmetries it is helpful to bend this square to a torus. Then it is also seen, that on the highest level the pattern consists of two pairs of symmetric squares: On a lower level, it consists of five smaller symmetric squares: On an even lower level, it consists of two symmetric squares: Even lower, it consists of three symmetric squares: Even lower, it consists of two symmetric squares: Finally we find, that it consists of only two tiny symmetric squares: Question 1: Are there other than the canonical labeling of the elements of $V$ (by Ackermann encoding which was used for the adjacency matrix above) that show the symmetries to the
eye? If not so: How can I understand that it is essentially this
labeling that has this property? Question 2: How can these visual observations be put in correspondence to abstract facts about the automorphism group of the
graph, including its size? Question 3: To which visible symmetries corresponds the invariance of the graph with respect to permutations of $\{0,\dots,7\}$ and with respect to complements? Question 4: How might an algorithm look like that - given a scrambled adjacency matrix (without any visible symmetries) - finds a
sequence of transpositions that lead to the unscrambled matrix above?

Additionally on page 83 we have the following proposition. Let $0 \neq s \in H^0(X,L)$. Then the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(Z(s))$ is isomorphic to $L$. So in particular, at least for an effective divisor $D$, the sections of the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(D)$ vanish on $D$. But above we saw that $\mathcal{O}(-D)$ is the sheaf of holomorphic functions vanishing on $D$, so I would naively expect that $\mathcal{O}(-D)$ would be the bundle whose sections vanish on $D$. How is it that $\mathcal{O}(-D)$ corresponds to the sheaf of functions vanishing on $D$, while it is $\mathcal{O}(D)$ that is the bundle whose sections vanish on $D$? In particular it would be nice if someone could explicitly describe, in terms of functions on patches (as far as this can be done), $\mathcal{O}(p)$ and $\mathcal{O}(-p)$, for a point $p$ in $\mathbb{P}^1$, showing explicitly how they behave as bundles with or without global sections, and making clear why it is $\mathcal{O}(-p)$ and not $\mathcal{O}(-p)$ that can be seen as a subsheaf of the sheaf of regular functions (which in particular is the ideal sheaf of the point).","['sheaf-theory', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

First, an action of the group $\mathbb C^*$ on an complex affine variety $\operatorname{Spec} A$ is the same as $\mathbb Z$-grading on its function ring $A$. Suppose also that there are only positive gradings, so it is $\mathbb N$-grading. Then there is a rational map $\operatorname{Spec} A \dashrightarrow \operatorname{Proj} A$ which is defined on the open subset $(\operatorname{Spec} A)_{ss}$ whose complement is given by the irrelevant ideal $\sum_{i>0} A_i$. Second, it is well-known that for a reductive group $G$ the variety $\operatorname{Spec} B^G$ classifies closed $G$-orbits in $\operatorname{Spec} B$. But $\operatorname{Proj} A$ is locally given by $\operatorname{Spec} (A_f)_0$ for a homogeneous element $f \in A_k$, so I wonder whether it classifies the closed orbits in $(\operatorname{Spec} A)_{ss}$? As the group is $\mathbb C^*$, every orbit is either one point or one-dimensional. Maybe $(\operatorname{Spec} A)_{ss}$ contains only one-dimensional orbits, so all of them are closed?

For example, using definitions 1), 2) or (3), it is clear that ""the"" universel cover of a point is itself, and the cover mapping $q : \{ \bullet \} \to \{ \bullet \}$ is the identity. Indeed : Using definition 1), the point is simply connected, so its universal cover is itself.
Using definition 2) or 3), note that the identity map $q : \{ \bullet \} \to \{ \bullet \}$ is a Galois cover and that the covers of $\{ \bullet \}$ are all the non-empty discrete spaces, so the only connected ones are the 1-point spaces $C$ (the cover mapping being the natural bijection $p : C \to \{ \bullet \}$ ). Therefore there exists a covering map $f : \{ \bullet \} \to C$ (which is just $p^{-1}$ ) which satisfies $p \circ f = q$ . However, we can't prove using definition 4) that ""the"" universel cover of a point is itself, since if $p : F \to \{ \bullet \}$ is a non-connected cover where $F$ is a discrete space of cardinality at least 2, there is no covering map $f : \{ \bullet \} \to F$ such that $p \circ f = q$ (as a covering map should be surjective).

And then, he proved that the addition function ""plus""($+$): $(x,y)\mapsto x+y$ the subtraction function ""minus""($-$): $(x,y)\mapsto x-y$ the multiplication function ""times"": $(x,y)\mapsto x\cdot y$ the maximum function: $(x,y)\mapsto \max(x,y)$ the minimum function $(x,y)\mapsto \min(x,y)$ are all continuous function from $\Bbb R^2$ to $\Bbb R$. Then he stated a theorem: Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, and let $f,g:X\to\Bbb R$. Then if $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $c\in X$, then $f+g,f-g,f\cdot g,\max(f,g),\min(f,g):X\to\Bbb R$ are all continuous at $c$. His proof, take $f+g$ case for example, went by: since $f\oplus g:X\to\Bbb R^2$ is continuous at $c$, and $(x,y)\mapsto x+y$ is continuous, so the composite function of $(f\oplus g)$ and $+$, $$\begin{alignat*}{2}
&+\circ (f\oplus g)\\

=&x\mapsto +((f(x),g(x)))\\
=&x\mapsto f(x)+g(x)\\
=&f+g\end{alignat*}$$
the last is what we want, is continuous at $c$. My question: It seems it can be more direct and natural to prove this theorem by a similar theorem in one-variable anaylsis, that is $\lim_{x\to c}(f+g)(x)=\lim_{x\to c}f(x)+\lim_{x\to c}g(x)$, with a little modify to the metric space cases. And then it can quite easily be made to derive that the continuity  case also hold. So why Tao didn't follow this way and he chose to define a rarely seen terminlogy direct sum (in analysis)? Is Tao's way more general or the theorem more strong to use in particular circumstances? Or are these often used in the more advanced courses?","['continuity', 'metric-spaces', 'analysis']"
1987820,"First course on scheme theory - opinions and comparisons, what text a novice should use?","I would like this thread to contain possibly useful information about books and approaches on studying scheme theory for the first time. 
I'm truly sorry if one finds it inapproprite for this site, but from the experience I had with math.stackexchange I think that I've seen more ""vague"" threads. Nowadays we have a massive number of introductions to modern algebraic geometry (scheme-theoretic, not complex, though in my humble opinion ""algebraic geometry"" is a bad name for the study of complex manifolds, ""complex analytic geometry"" describes the subject better) developed by Grothendieck and his school. I'll list the ones I know: Ravi Vakil - ""Foundations of Algebraic Geometry"" (free on his website, very conversational and leaves a lot of stuff to exercises) Robin Hartshorne - ""Algebraic Geometry"" (the classic, but studies only Noetherian schemes and possibly too formal for first times) Ulrich Goertz and Torsten Wedhorn - ""Algebraic Geometry: Part I: Schemes. With examples and exercises"" (600 pages of scheme theory, but no cohomology which is reserved to yet unpublished second volume) Joe Harris and David Eisenbud - ""Geometry of Schemes"" (introductory text on schemes, not a complete course on algebraic geometry, rather a text which tries to develop reader's intuition for studying schemes) Kenji Ueno - ""Algebraic Geometry 1/2/3"" (was published in 1999 by AMS, but apparently not well known by western community as well as by me) David Mumford and Tadao Oda - ""Algebraic Geometry II"" (expanded and updated version of Mumford's famous ""Red book"", seems neat and friendly) Liu Qing - ""Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves"" (arithmetically flavoured text) Alexander Grothendieck and Jean Dieudonne - ""Elements of Algebraic Geometry"" (the first ""book"" on algebraic geometry, very abstract and complete, 1800 pages-long, but exists only in French and possibly contains more than an beginner needs to know. But, maybe, even if all 1800 pages are not needed to learn scheme theory, they can be helpful to master it) The (not algebraic, mind you) variety of books is definitely a good thing. But it can be daunting for a novice to choose which one to use? For example, If one's inclinations lies in category theory and homological algebra/algebraic topology, which books emphasizes the ""categorical"" and ""homological"" modern approach? Introducing as much homological algebra as can be useful for the basics of scheme theory? (EGA is a possible candidate, people say it's very abstract) If one likes to think about mathematical objects from a ""geometric"" point of view, which book emphasized geometric intuition and connections with other areas of geometry more? (Eisenbud-Harris could be a candidate along with some course on classical algebraic geometry, as the sole purpose of the former is to help a reader to develop an intuition for abstract machinery) Which books is better for a classically-minded reader who is interested mostly in classical algebraic geometry, but wants to understand the modern approach? (possibly, Hartshorne? As he himself says in the preface that he is the classical algebraic geometer, and his books contain a review of classical AG and 2 chapters of applications of the machinery to classical questions, in particular, study of curves and surfaces) I hope this thread and possible answers could be a useful resource for those starting learning algebraic geometry for the first time.","['algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request', 'sheaf-cohomology', 'schemes', 'book-recommendation']"
1987883,Understanding the pullback of a sheaf of differentials,"Let $f: X \to Y$ be a morphism of schemes over a field. I'd like to know why the sections of the sheaf $f ^* \Omega _Y$ are given by $d \phi$ for $\phi \in \mathscr O_Y$. Does this mean that e.g. $f ^* \Omega _Y(X)=\Omega _Y(Y)$, without any additional constraints? Why can the sections of $f ^* \Omega _Y$ be seen this way? $f^*$ is defined by $f ^* \mathscr F = f^{-1} \mathscr F \otimes_{f^{-1}\mathscr O_Y} \mathscr O_X$, and it is known that $(f^* \mathscr O_Y^{\oplus n})(U)= (\mathscr O_X^{\oplus n})(f^{-1}(U))$, so since $\Omega_Y$ is locally-free it follows that $\Omega_X$ is locally-free too. This seems ""close"" to what we want to show. How does the correspondence between sections of $f ^* \Omega _Y$ and elements $d\phi$ work?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1987930,Martingale and a sequence of non-negative real numbers.,"Let $X_0,X_1,\dots$ be integrable and non-negative random variables. Let $\mathcal{F}_n:=\sigma(X_0,\dots,X_n)$ and suppose that $\mathbb{E}(X_{n+1}\mid\mathcal{F}_n)\leq b_n + X_n$ where $(b_n)$ is a sequence of non-negative real numbers with $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty b_n<\infty$ . Show that $X_\infty:=\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}X_n$ exists almost surely and $X_\infty$ is integrable. (Hint: Consider the $Y_n=X_n+\sum\limits_{k=n}^\infty b_k$ ) So if I can show that $X_n$ is a sub- or supermartingale and that $\sup E(|X_n|)<\infty$ then I know that $X_\infty:=\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}X_n$ exists almost surely and $X_\infty$ is integrable. Unfortunately I don't know how to show that it's a sub- or a supermartingale since the $b_n$ are unkown. I tried to work with the hint $Y_n=X_n+\sum\limits_{k=n}^\infty b_k$ $$E(Y_{n+1}\mid \mathcal{F}_n)=E(X_{n+1}+\sum\limits_{k=n+1}^\infty b_k\mid \mathcal{F}_n)=E(X_{n+1}\mid \mathcal{F}_n)+\sum\limits_{k=n+1}^\infty b_k$$ But I don't see how this is useful.","['random-walk', 'martingales', 'probability-theory', 'convergence-divergence']"
1987943,Getting confused over a T-test,"its been a while since I've done this and I am getting rather confused. Let's say I have two data sets of size $n_1$ and $n_2$ $X={X_1, X_2,.. X_{n_1}}$ $Y={Y_1, Y_2,.. Y_{n_2}}$ and want to construct a t-test. I have seen this formula in lots of books, what is the intuition and is this correct for finding a t-test? $T=\dfrac{\bar{X}-\bar{Y}}{\sqrt{\dfrac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\dfrac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$ I am getting confused a little, I see some books telling me to be careful is my variances are equal. Can i not just put them into this formula either way? Also are we always referring to sample population, mean and standard deviation. How does the formula change if we have a the population data? How does this formula change if the data is paired? Thank you all very much :)","['means', 'statistical-inference', 'standard-deviation', 'hypothesis-testing', 'statistics']"
1987944,Complete monotonicity of a sequence related to tetration,"Let $\Delta$ denote the forward difference operator on a sequence:
$$\Delta s_n = s_{n+1} - s_n,$$
and $\Delta^m$ denote the forward difference of the order $m$:
$$\Delta^0 s_n = s_n, \quad \Delta^{m+1} s_n = \Delta\left(\Delta^m s_n\right).$$
We say that a sequence $s_n$ is completely monotone iff
$$(-1)^m \Delta^{m} s_n > 0,$$
i.e. the sequence $s_n$ itself is positive and decreasing, its first differences $\Delta s_n$ are negative and increasing (that is, decreasing in absolute values), its second differences $\Delta^2 s_n$ are positive and decreasing  (like the sequence $s_n$ itself), and so on. So, the sequence of second differences of a completely monotone sequence is also completely monotone (and so is the sequence of its differences of any even order). Let $a$ be a real number in the interval $1<a<e^{1/e}$. Let ${^n a}$ denote tetration :
$${^0 a}=1, \quad {^{(n+1)} a} = a^{\left({^n a}\right)}.$$
The sequence ${^n a}$ is strictly increasing and converges to the limit
$${^\infty a} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\left({^n a}\right) = \frac{W(-\ln a)}{-\ln a},$$
where $W(x)$ is the Lambert $W$-function . Let $s_n = {^\infty a} - {^n a}$. It appears that the sequence $s_n$ is completely monotone. How can we prove it?","['conjectures', 'monotone-functions', 'lambert-w', 'sequences-and-series', 'tetration']"
1987966,"Is the following integration ""trick"" valid to reduce my integrand to a constant?","$$\int_2^4 \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{\ln(3+x)}{\ln(9-x)}} +1}dx = 1$$ I noticed when $x$ went from $2$ to $4$, $3+x$ went from $5$ to $7$, and $9-x$ went from $7$ to $5$. I noticed that if we reverse the interval of $9-x$ we obtain $-(9-x)$ and whose interval goes from $5$ to $7$. In short, I concluded that reversing the interval of $9-x$ yielded the expression $3+x$. Therefore I allowed the above integral to be $$\int_2^4 \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{\ln(3+x)}{\ln(9-x)}} +1} dx = \int_2^4 \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{\ln(3+x)}{\ln(3+x)}} +1} dx.$$ Effectively, the logs cancelled and I was left with $\int_2^4 {1\over 1+1}dx =1$.","['integration', 'definite-integrals']"
1987998,What is the difference between a function and a distribution?,"I remember there was a tongue-in-cheek rule in mathematical analysis saying that to obtain the Fourier transform of a function $f(t)$, it is enough to get its Laplace transform $F(s)$, and replace $s$ by $j\omega$. Because their formula is pretty much the same except for the variable of integration. And I know that this is not necessarily true (that's why I used the term tongue-in-cheek) e.g. take $f(t)=1$ to see the obvious difference.
I read somewhere that although their formula is somehow similar, their result is not necessarily similar because Laplace transform is a function and Fourier transform is a distribution . For example, the Dirac delta, $\delta(\omega)$ is a distribution and not a function. So this led me to wonder: What is the difference between a function and a distribution? (preferably in layman's terms) Why the Laplace transform is a function and Fourier transform is a distribution? I mean, they are both infinite integrals. So what am I missing?","['laplace-transform', 'fourier-analysis', 'analysis', 'functions']"

I was trying to do this problem, and ended up with the wrong answer, $\frac{28}{13}$, instead of the correct answer of $\frac{11}{3}$. I checked my integrations on symbolab and those where coming out right, so it seems like maybe my bounds for the integrals were wrong.

Suppose $m$ and $n$ are two $\sigma$-finite measures on $(X,\mathcal A)$ such that $m(A)=n(A)$ for all $A\in \mathcal C$. Is it true that $m(A)=n(A)$ for all $A\in \sigma(\mathcal C) ?$ What if $m$ and $n$ are finite ? I'm persuaded both are not true since $\mathcal C$ need not be a $\pi$-system (that is to say closed under intersection). I've been looking for a counter-example, but the finiteness assumptions make it difficult. For example, on $(\mathbb R, \mathcal B(\mathbb R))$, let $\mu(\emptyset)=0$ and $\mu(A)=\infty$ whenever $A$ is a nonempty Borel set. $\mu$ and the counting measure agree on all open sets, but obviously not on $\mathcal B(\mathbb R)$.

How many ways are there to deal the cards? The answer is $\frac{52P5}{(5!)^5}$ or $\frac{52!}{47!5!}$ I understand the reason after seeing the answer: $25$ ordered cards are picked from the deck of $52$, then divided by the number of ways each hand can be ordered, because the order of a hand does not matter. However, before seeing the answer I came up with this attempt: You choose $5$ cards from $52$, the order doesn't matter so we have $52\choose{5}$. Then you're left with $47$ cards and for the next hand we have $47\choose{5}$. The final sum is ${{52}\choose{5}} + {{47}\choose{5}} + {{42}\choose{5}} + {{37}\choose{5}} + {{32}\choose{5}}$.
