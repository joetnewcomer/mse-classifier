2583494,Monotone function with $f(\mathbb{R}) = \mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}$,"I want to prove per contradiction, that there doesn't exist a strictly monotone function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with
$$ f(\mathbb{R}) = \mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q} $$ but I'm not sure if this argumentation is right. Assume there exists such a function $f$.
Let be $ a \in \mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}$ and $(\frac{a}{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in (\mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q})^\mathbb{N}$.
Then there exist $b_n \in \mathbb{R}: f(b_n) = \frac{a}{n}$.
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f(b_n) = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{a}{n} = 0 \notin \mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q} $$
But because of the monotony of $f$, for a $b \in \mathbb{R}$
$$ \lim_{x \to b} f(x)$$
has to exists and so it has to be in $\mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q}$. Is there some example for non-strictly monotone functions? (it has to be $\mathrm{im}(f) = \mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q})$","['real-analysis', 'monotone-functions']"
2583507,"Confusion with immersions, embeddings, local homeomorphisms, and local diffeomorphisms.","Definitions. A local homeo/diffemorphism is a continuous/smooth map $f:X\to Y$ such that there's an open cover $(U_i)$ of $X$ for which $f|_{U_i}:U_i\to fU_i$ is a homeo/diffeomorphism. A topological/smooth embedding is a continuous/smooth map $f:X\to Y$ which is a homeo/diffeomorphism onto its image. In other words, the first factor of its image factorization is an isomorphism. If I understand correctly, a local homeo/diffeomorphism is thus precisely a local topological/smooth embedding: there's an open cover of the domain making the restrictions into topological/smooth embeddings. This leads me to two sources of confusion. This answer involves the words ""local diffeomorphism onto its image"". This is strange to me - it seems, at least using the my definition, that a smooth map is a local diffeomorphism iff its a local diffeomorphism onto its image. What am I missing here? This answer proves that any immersion (injective differential) is locally a smooth homeomorphism onto its image with injective derivative, i.e a local immersion which is a local topological embedding. Following my (probably frail) reasoning in the paragraph following the definitions, this would imply any immersion is a local homeomorphism. In fact the answer seems to prove any immersion is locally a smooth embedding (following my definition) since the local section constructed seems smooth. But that would mean it's even a local diffeomorphism! (I am not sure which definition of 'embedding' the asker had in mind). I am confused: (1) makes me think I am corrigibly crazy. (2) makes me think I'm hopelessly crazy, since by the inverse function theorem a smooth map is a local diffeomorphism iff it's an immersion and a submersion, and I also don't think immersions need to be local homeomorphisms. What are my mistakes?","['multivariable-calculus', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'manifolds']"

By using proof by induction: (i) Prove that $\sqrt{2} ≤ x_n ≤ 2$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. (ii) Prove that $x_n ≤ x_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. For (i) Let's prove the case base case, for $n=1$ we have that $\sqrt{2} \leq x_1\leq 2$ which is clearly true by $x_1=\sqrt{2}$ Now we assume true for $n=k$ $\Longrightarrow$ $\sqrt{2}\leq x_k\leq2$ and we are required to prove $\sqrt{2}\leq x_{k+1} \leq 2$. From our hypothesis : $\sqrt{2}\leq x_k\leq2$ however we know that $x_{k+1} =\sqrt{2x_k}\Longrightarrow x_k = \frac{(x_{k+1})^2}{2}$ so we have  $\sqrt{2}\leq \frac{(x_{k+1})^2}{2}\leq2 \Leftrightarrow \sqrt{2\sqrt{2}}\leq x_{k+1} \leq 2$.

So I was thinking of somehow applying dominated convergence.  The problem, is that you have to do this with $K$, not $n$, which means you have to probably look at some sequence $K_i$?  The other thing is that we need to somehow exploit $||\alpha \circ f_n||_1\leq M$.  I think we can do that by using a simpler function instead of $\alpha$ that is dominated by $\alpha$ for all values greater than a suitable $K$.","['normed-spaces', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'analysis']"

2583594,Prove that a group $G$ of order 280 is not simple and has a subgroup of order 35,"Prove that a group $G$ of order $280=2^3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$ is not simple and has a subgroup of order 35 Using Sylow's theorem's it was easy to prove that $G$ is not simple. I had a proof for the second statement, but I was unsure. The question "" Proving if $|G|=280$, then $G$ is not simple "" inspired me for a a different proof. Are both proofs correct? Proof 1 ""I'm pretty sure the following is correct"" Note $|\mathrm{Syl}_7(G)| \in \{1,8\}, |\mathrm{Syl}_5(G)| \in \{1,56\}$ and $|\mathrm{Syl}_2(G)| \in \{1,5,7,35\}$ If $|\mathrm{Syl}_7(G)| =1$ then the statement is easily proven. Choose a $P\in \mathrm{Syl}_7(G)$ which is also a normal subgroup and a $Q\in \mathrm{Syl}_5(G)$, then since $P\cap Q = 1$ the group $PQ\leq G$ and $|PQ|=|P|\cdot |Q| = 35$. If $|\mathrm{Syl}_7(G)| =8$ then there are $8$ Sylow 7-subgroups of $G$. Now consider the action of $G$ on $\mathrm{Syl}_7(G)$ by conjugation. Choose a $P\in \mathrm{Syl}_7(G)$ and consider the orbit-stabilizer formula
$$
|G| = |G_P|\cdot |P^G| \Rightarrow 280 = |G_P| \cdot 8 \Rightarrow |G_P| = 35
$$
Now since $G_P = \{g\in G: P^g= P\} = N_G(P) \leq G$ the group $N_G(P)$ is a subgroup  of $G$ with the desired order. Proof 2 "" Less sure about this proof ... "" First notice that if $|\mathrm{Syl}_7(G)|=1$ or $|\mathrm{Syl}_5(G)| =1$ then choosing a $P$ in one and a $Q$ in the other Sylow $p$-subgroups once again creates a $PQ\leq G$ with order $35$. Let nog $|\mathrm{Syl}_7(G)| \not =1, |\mathrm{Syl}_5(G)| \not = 1$, then because the group $G$ is not simple $|\mathrm{Syl}_2(G)|=1$. Let $P\in \mathrm{Syl}_2(G)$ then $P\trianglelefteq G$ with order 8. Now consider the quotient group $G/P$ which has order 35. This group has through Sylow's theorems exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, $A$ and one Sylow 7-subgroup $B$. Notice how $A\trianglelefteq G/P$ and $|A|=5$ implies that $A$ is a cylic group with a generator $\langle Pa\rangle$ for a certain $a \in G$. Then $o(Pa) = 5$ which implies $a^5 \in P$. Because it is possible to choose 8 different $\tilde a\in G$ such that $Pa = P\tilde a$, choose now the $\tilde a$ such that $\tilde a^5=1$. Repeat for $B= \langle P\tilde b\rangle$ such that $\tilde b^7 = 1$. ($\color{red}{\text{? unsure if this is right}}$) Now since $\langle \tilde a \rangle \times \langle \tilde b\rangle \cong \langle \tilde a\rangle \cdot \langle \tilde b\rangle$ it follows that $\langle \tilde a \rangle \cdot \langle \tilde b\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$ with order 35. Third proof (?) Writing the last proof out, made me think of one shorter version of the last statement. Since $5\mid |G|$ and $7\mid |G|$ then by Cauchy's theorem there is a $a, b\in G$ such that $o(a)=5, o(b)=7$. Now consider $\langle a\rangle \cdot \langle b\rangle$ which has trivial intersection and is a subgroup of $G$.

2583642,A question about the uniqueness in a version of Riesz representation theorem,"In my notes, I have this version of the Riesz representation theorem:
Let $X$ be a separable Hilbert space, and let $\{\phi_n\}_n\subset X$ a countable orthonormal set. Let $\{c_k\}_k\in l^2$ a sequence. There exist an element $x\in X$ such that $\forall k\in\mathbb{N},\ (x\mid\phi_k)=c_k$. My question is: with these hypothesis, is there a unique $x\in X?$.
I think that with the additional hypothesis that $\{\phi_n\}_n$ is complete, then I have the uniqueness: as a matter of fact if there were two elements $x,y\in X$ that verify the theorem, then I would have
$$(x-y\mid \phi_k)=0\ \forall k,$$
Which would imply $$x-y\in clos(\{Span(\{\phi_k\}_k\})^\perp=X^\perp,$$ and then
$$(x-y\mid x-y)=0\Rightarrow x-y=0.$$

First, we know that in $\mathbb{R}$ the compact sets are the closed and bounded sets (Heine-Borel), then, can be a set that is only bounded compact? I don't think so. I know that the definition that Kolomorov use is, really, the definition of sequentially compact, and I know that the compactness and the sequentially compactness are equivalent in metric spaces. Then, am I losing something of context in the book? Moreover, the book says that an arbitrary subset of a compact set is compact, but, is it true? I know that $[0,1]\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is compact but $\left\{\displaystyle\frac{1}{n}:n\in\mathbb{N} \right\}\subseteq[0,1]$ is not compact. Again, Kolmogorov use some definition that I don't have?

2583709,Why is this combination of nearest-integer functions --- surprisingly --- continuous?,"Alright, I didn't know the best way to formulate my question. Basically, whilst doing some physics research, I naturally came upon the function $$ f(x) = 2x[x] - [x]^2 $$ where I use $[x]$ as notation for the `nearest-integer function' (i.e. rounding off). Usually this function has to have a caveat of how we exactly define the value for $x \in \frac{1}{2} \mathbb Z$, but interestingly for this function it does not matter, since it turns out to be continuous! In fact, it turns out $f(x)$ is exactly given by the glued function of taking all the tangent lines of $x^2$ at integer values of $x$: (Note: due to properties of $x^2$, the tangent lines exactly intersect at half-integer values of $x$.) So my question is not literally `why is it continuous?', but rather: considering it is continuous, and considering that that is not a generic property of functions which are defined in terms of nearest-integer functions, is there a better (i.e. more insightful) way of expressing $f(x)$? Relatedly, is there some part of mathematics where functions similar to these naturally arise?","['continuity', 'discrete-mathematics']"
2583716,Finding stationary distribution of the following stochastic process?,"Take the stochastic process coming from $$\ddot X + \frac{\eta}{m} \dot X + \frac{k}{m}X = \frac{1}{m} W(t)\tag{1}$$ (where $W$ is white noise) or equivalently the Itô differential equation $$ d \begin{pmatrix} X\\V\\\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} V\\ -\dfrac{\eta}{m} V - \dfrac{k}{m}X\\\end{pmatrix}dt + \begin{pmatrix} 0&0\\0&\frac1m\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} d\beta_1 \\d\beta_2\end{pmatrix}\tag{2}  $$ $$ \equiv d \mathbf{X} = f(\mathbf{X})dt + \mathbf{L}\, d\boldsymbol{\beta} \tag{3}.$$ This is just the damped harmonic oscillator driven by white noise. In particular, $\beta_1,\beta_2$ are Brownian motion. I know from the literature that the stationary distribution is of the form $$p(x,v) = \exp( - Ax^2 - Bv^2 )$$
(see edit). Attempt: I believe I need to use the Fokker-Planck equation: $$\frac{\partial p(\mathbf{X},t)}{\partial t} = 0= - \sum_{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial X_i}[\mathbf{f}_i(\mathbf{X})p(\mathbf{X},t)]+ \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial X_i X_j}\left[(\mathbf{L}^T\mathbf{L})_{ij} \,p(\mathbf{X},t)\right]\tag{4}$$
  where the $0$ is because we consider the stationary distribution. This, however, gives me (writing $p(\mathbf{X},t) = p(x,v)$) $$0=-\left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(vp(x,v)) + \frac{\partial}{\partial v}\left(\left( -\frac{\eta}{m}v - \frac{k}{m}x\right) p(x,v)\right) \right]+ \frac12 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial v^2} \frac{p(x,v)}{m^2}\tag{5}$$ which is certainly not solved by a Gaussian $p(x,v)$.

2583739,Being an open embedding is not local on the source,"This is Exercise 7.1.D of Vakil's notes. A property $P$ being local on the source means that to check if a morphism $\pi: X \to Y$ has $P$, it suffices to check on any open cover $\{U_i\}$ of X. I can't find an example showing why being an open embedding is not local on the source. In fact, let $\pi: (X, \mathscr{O}_X) \to (Y, \mathscr{O}_Y)$ is a morphism of schemes. Let $\{(U_i, \mathscr{O}_X|_{U_i})\}$ be an open cover of $X$. Suppose $\pi|_{U_i} = \pi_i$ is an open embedding for all $i$, then there are isomorphisms $(U_i, \mathscr{O}_X|_{U_i}) \xrightarrow[]{\rho_i}(V_i, \mathscr{O}_Y|_{V_i})$ where $V_i$ is an open subset of $Y$. Now these isomorphisms glue to an isomorphism $(X, \mathscr{O}_X) \to (\bigcup V_i, \mathscr{O}_Y|_{\bigcup V_i})$ where $\bigcup V_i$ is an open subset of $Y$. So $\pi$ is an open embedding. What's wrong in my argument above? Can anyone give me a counterexample showing this is not open on the source? Thanks!","['schemes', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2583949,projection maps from product space are open,"If $X_i$ is a family of topological spaces with $i\in I$, and $X=\prod_{i\in I} X_i$ is product topological space then the maps $\pi_k:X\rightarrow X_k$ are open. To prove this, we consider subbasic open sets of product topology; then the image of them under $\pi_k$ is either whole space $X_k$ or an open set in $X_k$ since subbasic open set in $X$ is of the form $\prod_{i} U_i $ where $U_i$'s are open in $X_i$ and  all $U_i$ except one equals $X_i$.

2583983,How to prove a quotient space is again compact and Hausdorff,"I'm struggling with a topology question and I'm having a hard time proving the following: 
If I know that $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, $A$ is a closed subspace and $X/A$ denotes the quotient space of $X$ which identifies $A$ to a single point. Then I'd like to show, that $X/A$ is a compact Hausdorff space. So far I have that since $A$ is a closed subspace of a compact space $X$ then $A$ is compact as well. Since $A$ is a subspace of a Hausdorff space then $A$ is a Hausdorff space as well. Since $X/A$ is the quotient space of $X$, which identifies $A$ to a single point, then by the definition of a quotient space (Munkres p. 137) then $X/A$ is a partition of $X$ into disjoint subsets whose union is $X$. Also there exist a surjective map $p:X \to X/A$  that carries each point of $X$ to the the element of $X/A$ containing it. Since $p$ is a quotient map this is equivalent to saying that $p$ is continuous. And now I can't seem to get any further. How do I prove that $X/A$ is compact and Hausdorff?","['general-topology', 'separation-axioms', 'compactness', 'quotient-spaces']"

The inscribed circle must touch all edges and the circumscribed circle must pass through all vertices. Can anyone verify my hypothesis or find a counter-proof? I have tried some regular polygons and some common triangles and it has held so far. I have mainly put this question to check that it holds for regular polygons but I believe that it should also hold for irregular polygons (just gut feeling, could be false). I would appreciate any help that I can receive. Thanks in advance!

There exists $t_i\rightarrow s, t_i\in I_p$. Define $q$ as $\text{lim}(\gamma_p(t_i))$ and take a maximal integral curve passing by $q$ as $(\gamma_q,I_q)$. Then since the vector fields are $C^\infty$, $\gamma_q(I_q)\cap\gamma_p(I_p)$ is nonempty (intuitively, this is clear but don't really know how to show it). On the intersection, $\gamma_p$ and $\gamma_q$ coincide. So we can extend the maximal curve $\gamma_p$ to include $\gamma_q$.

Now if we let $S = \bigcap_{K=1}^\infty \bigcup_{n=K}^\infty E_n$, then we know that $m^*(S)=0$ hence $S$ is measurable. For $x\in [0,1]\setminus S = \bigcup_{K=1}^\infty \bigcap_{j=K}^\infty([0,1]\setminus E_j)$ and this implies that there exists $K\in \mathbb{N},  \forall j\ge K$, and $x \notin E_j$.

Since $m(S)=0$, we have $\lim \limits_{j \to \infty} f_{n_j}(x)=f(x)$ almost everywhere on $[0,1]$. Since $f_{n_j}$ are measurable hence $f$ is measurable. Is this correct?

2584552,Proof of Cayley-Hamilton Theorem in infinite fields only?,"While trying to prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, I came up with the following proof: If $A$ is a diagonalizable matrix, so $A=SDS^{-1}$ with $D$ diagonal, then, letting $$P(\lambda)=\det(A-\lambda I)=\sum_{i=0}^n c_i\lambda^i,$$ $$``P(A)"" = \sum_{i=0}^n c_i A^i = S\left(\sum_{i=0}^n c_i D^i \right)S^{-1},$$ which is clearly the zero matrix as, if $D$ contains $\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_n$ on its diagonal, $D^i$ contains $\lambda_1^i,\cdots,\lambda_n^i$, and each of the eigenvalues satisfy the characteristic polynomial. So, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is true for diagonalizable matrices. Specifically, it is true for all matrices with $n$ distinct eigenvalues, or equivalently all matrices whose characteristic polynomials have no repeated roots. However, the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are polynomials in the elements $a_1,\cdots,a_{n^2}$ of the matrix $A$. Also, there is a polynomial expression of the coefficients of a polynomial that is $0$ iff the polynomial has a repeated root (the resultant ). So, there exists some polynomial $Q$ such that either the matrix $A$ satisfies its characteristic polynomial or $$Q(a_1,\cdots,a_{n^2}) = 0.$$ However, a matrix inputted into its characteristic polynomial is itself a matrix whose elements are polynomial functions $R_1,\cdots,R_{n^2}$ of the elements of the matrix. Thus, for each $1\leq i\leq n^2$ and any values $a_1,\cdots,a_{n^2}$, we have either that $$Q(a_1,\cdots,a_{n^2}) = 0\ \mathrm{or}\ R_i(a_1,\cdots,a_{n^2}) = 0.$$ Thus, for all $(a_1,\cdots,a_{n^2}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n^2}$, and each $1\leq i\leq n^2$, we have $$Q(a_1,\cdots,a_{n^2})\cdot R_i(a_1,\cdots,a_{n^2}) = 0.$$ However, a polynomial (here $QR_i$) that equals zero everywhere must be the zero polynomial, and if a product of two polynomials is the zero polynomial, one of the two must be the zero polynomial. It's clearly not $Q$, since there exist matrices with distinct eigenvalues. So, each $R_i$ must be identically $0$, and the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is proven. However, this only works in infinite fields. In finite fields, the two statements: If a polynomial is $0$ everywhere, it is the zero polynomial. If two polynomials multiply to make the zero polynomial, one of them must be the zero polynomial. are not both true (I'm sure the first one isn't; I'm not sure about the second). Is there a way to rigorize the notion that ""It's an algebraic statement that's true in, say, $\mathbb{R}$, so it must be true in any field,"" or is there some other way to extend this proof to finite fields? Or does this proof just only work (or make sense) in infinite fields?","['cayley-hamilton', 'finite-fields', 'linear-algebra']"

2584768,A new notion of measurable set,"The idea behind the Riemann integral is to approximate functions by step functions, for which there is a natural notion of integral. More specifically, we consider all step functions that lie either entirely above or entirely below our function, assign integrals to each of the step functions in these families, and then consider respectively the infimum or supremum of these two families. Critically, if the two numbers match, we say that the function is Riemann integrable. My question is about the definition of Lebesgue measurable , and why it doesn't seem to follow the same idea. We can define the outer measure of a subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}$ as the infimum of the 'sizes' of countable unions of disjoint intervals that contain $S$. My instinct, now, might be to define some sort of 'inner measure' as the supremum of the 'sizes' of countable unions of disjoint intervals that are contained within $S$. I would like to say that a set is measurable if these two numbers agree. A little thought reveals that this is a very restrictive definition. The set of irrational numbers within $[0,1]$, for instance, is not measurable in this sense. Indeed, I think that any such 'measurable' set must be a countable union of disjoint intervals and discrete points. I now have two questions: Question 1: is the characterisation above correct? Is a set which is 'measurable' in the sense I've defined it simply a countable union of disjoint intervals and discrete points? Edit: The answer is ""no"" (see Michael's answer below); the Cantor set is a counterexample. I ask instead: what is the correct characterisation of such 'measurable' sets? Question 2: could we have known, ahead of time, that this idea would not work? It seemed sensible to me at first, by analogy with the Riemann integral, to define measurable in the above way, and it was only after exploring the consequences that I saw it didn't work. Is there some intuition or understanding that would have led me to discard the idea immediately?","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory', 'riemann-integration']"

2584783,Which metrics on exterior power are induced from metrics on the base?,"$\newcommand{\id}{\text{id}}$
$\newcommand{\Hom}{\text{Hom}}$ Let $V$ be a $d$-dimensional real vector space, and let $2 \le k \le d-1$. Every inner product on $V$ induces an inner product on $\Lambda^k V$, in the following way $$ \langle v_1 \wedge \dots \wedge v_k , w_1 \wedge \dots \wedge w_k \rangle:=\det (\langle v_i ,w_j \rangle). \tag{1}$$ Question: What are necessary and sufficient conditions on an inner product on $\Lambda^k V$ to to be induced from a product on $V$ as in $(1)$? (I restricted $k \neq 1,d$ because then of course, any metric is induced by a metric on the base). I think there should be some ""compatibility"" or ""symmetry"" conditions, but I am not sure how to formulate them. Edit: If there exist an inducing product at the base, this product is unique. Perhaps we can construct an ""inverse map"" which is defined on all products on $\Lambda^k V$, and see when the result is an honest inner product on $V$. Proof of uniqueness: Suppose $g_1,g_2$ are inner products on $V$, which induce the same product on $\Lambda^k V$. Let $A:(V,g_1) \to (V,g_2)$ be an isometry. Then the induced exterior map $$\bigwedge ^k A:(\Lambda^k V,\Lambda^k g_1) \to (\Lambda^k V,\Lambda^k g_2)$$ is an isometry, where $\Lambda^k g_i$ is the metric on $ \Lambda^k V$ induced by $g_i$ via $(1)$. Since by assumption $\Lambda^k g_1=\Lambda^k g_2$, we get that $$\bigwedge ^k A:(\Lambda^k V,\Lambda^k g_1) \to (\Lambda^k V,\Lambda^k g_1)$$ is an isometry, i.e. $$ \id_{\Lambda_k(V)}=(\bigwedge ^k A)^T \circ \bigwedge ^k A= \bigwedge ^k A^T \circ \bigwedge ^k A=\bigwedge ^k A^T A,$$ where the transpose in $A^T$ is taken with respect to the metric $g_1$. Denote $S=A^TA$. Then $S \in \Hom(V,V)$ is symmetric (w.r.t. $g_1$) and positive-definite , and satisfies $  \id_{\Lambda_k(V)}  =\bigwedge^k S $. This implies $S=\id_V$. (For a short proof, see this answer ). So, we have obtained $A^TA=\id_V$; Remembering the transpose was taken w.r.t $g_1$, this shows $A$ is an automorphism of $(V,g_1)$. Recalling that we assumed $A:(V,g_1) \to (V,g_2)$ was an isometry, this shows $g_1=g_2$.","['differential-geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'exterior-algebra']"

2585483,Interesting Olympiad Style Problem about Invariance,"Problem: The following operations are permitted with the quadratic polynomial $ax^2 +bx +c:$ (a) switch $a$ and $c$, (b) replace $x$ by $x + t$ where $t$ is any real. By repeating these operations, can you transform $x^2 − x − 2$ into $x^2 − x − 1?$ My Attempt: Notice that the sum of coefficients $S\equiv a+b+c\pmod{t}$ is invariant. This is clear if we switch $a$ and $c.$ If we replace $x$ with $x+t$ then we have $ax^2+(2at+b)x+(at^2+bt+c)$ and so $S\equiv a+2at+b+at^2+bt+c\equiv a+b+c\pmod{t}.$ Now for $x^2-x-2$ we have $S\equiv -2\pmod{t}$ and at the end we want $S\equiv -1\pmod{t}$, which is impossible.

2585484,Why is the cross product topology $\neq$ the tychonoff product topology?,"When I learned about the product topology, I did not really take the definition from the textbook, but rather tried to construct a “senseful topology” on my own as follows: If we think about $\mathbb R^2$, then every open set I could imagine had the property that for every point, every horizontal and vertical “fiber” had to be open in $X, Y$, respectively. To be rigorous: A subset $S \subset X\times Y$ is called open, if for every $(x, y)\in S$, $\pi_X^{-1}(x) \cap S = \{x\}\times U$ with $U$ open in $Y$, and similarly for $y$.  It is easily checked that this indeed forms a topology on $X\times Y$. When I revisited some parts about topology, I figured out what a categorical product is and what the actual definition of the Tychonoff product is. I later even figured out that my guessed topology has a name, it's the “cross topology”.  However, Just like the box topology, which is generated by the product of open sets $U\times V$, it is said to be strictly finer (see e.g. [1]) than the categorical, or “Tychonoff” product topology, which is the coarsest topology making each of the projections continuous.  That came as quite a shock to me, as I took it for granted that cross and tychonoff are just different characterizations! Since However, I fail to see a counterexample, i.e. two topological spaces $X, Y$, and a set $S\subset X\times Y$, which is open with respect to the cross topology, but not the tychonoff topology. I sat down with my professor and we tried to figure out some obvious examples (I only remember constructing things with the countable-complement topology), but we didn't end up with a satisfying answer. As the Tychonoff topology is defined implicitly by being the coarsest topology generated by $\pi_X^{-1}(\mathcal T_X),\, \pi_Y^{-1}(\mathcal T_Y)$, I'm not even sure anymore how we show that some candidate set has to be contained (or not) in there, i.e. when exactly a set can be generated by finite intersections and arbitrary unions of the projection's “stripes”.0 What am I missing / what would be a useful approach here?

The moprhism $id_X \times Spec(\sigma) : X_L \to X_L$ do not induce maps $X_L(A) \to X_L(A)$, because $id_X \times Spec(\sigma)$ is a $K$-morphism and not a $L$-morphism.

There is a possibility for the action on an $L$-point $x \in X(L) = X_L(L)$, namely

(as an $L$-morphism from $Spec(L)$ to $X_L$).

The book proved it by contradiction: for each $i$, it constructed a complete Ricci flat manifold $(M_i,g_i)$, with $\lim\limits_{i\rightarrow \infty}\frac{Vol(B(p_i,r)}{\omega_n r^n}\geq(1-\frac{1}{i})$, and $(M_i,g_i)$ is not isometric to Euclidean space. But the book said that for all $r>0$, the $C^{1,\alpha}$ harmonic norm of $(M_i,g_i)$ of scale $r$ is nonzero. After scaling the metric suitably, it assumed the $C^{1,\alpha}$ harmonic norm of $(M_i,\bar{g_i})$ less than 1, and the pointed norm has positive lower bound. I think it is impossible, but I do not know how to correct it.

I would appreciate any clarification or hint given. Let $S_d = \left\{{m \in \mathbb Z: 1 \le m \le n, \gcd \left\{{m, n}\right\} = d}\right\}$. That is, $S_d$ is all the numbers less than or equal to $n$ whose $\text{gcd}$ with $n$ is $d$. Now from Divide by $\text{gcd}$ for Coprime Integers we have: $$\gcd \left\{{m, n}\right\} = d \iff \dfrac m d, \dfrac n d \in \mathbb Z: \dfrac m d \perp \dfrac n d$$ So the number of integers in $S_d$ equals the number of positive integers no bigger than $n/d$ which are prime to $n/d$. By definition of the Euler function stated in the exercise, this is : $$|S_d| = \phi\bigg(\frac{n}{d}\bigg)$$ From the definition of the $S_d$, it follows that for all $1≤m≤n$ : $$\exists d | n: m \in S_d$$ which leads to : $$\displaystyle \left\{{1, \ldots, n}\right\} = \bigcup_{d |n} S_d$$ From the way I defined $S_d$ though, it also follows that they are pairwise disjoint. Now from Corollary to Cardinality of Set Union, it follows that : $$n=\sum_{d|n} |S_d| = \sum_{d|n} \phi \left({\dfrac n d}\right)$$ But using the fact that the sum over divisors equals the sum over quotients, we derive the formula wanted : $$\sum_{d | n} \phi \left({\dfrac n d}\right) = \sum_{d |n} \phi \left({d}\right)$$","['totient-function', 'abstract-algebra', 'proof-verification', 'number-theory', 'group-theory']"
