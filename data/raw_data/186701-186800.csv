3463627,Well-defined functor of triangulated category,"Let $F \colon D \to D'$ be a morphism of triangulated categories, $S$ a multiplicative system compatible with triangulated structure of $D$ . Supposing the colimits below exist, Lemma 13.14.3 defines a morphism $$

3463628,Calculating odds of Minesweeper is this correct?,"EDIT Please see new question: Calculating Minesweeper Odds Is this calculation correct? The answers here helped me create the new question (The post below has some errors which makes it harder to review) The below question is only kept for historical purposes. So I originally asked this question here , given that the number of mines was unknown. However user2661923 pointed out that the 104 different possibilities do not have an equal weight . For example, having 4 mines in total is more likely than having 5 mines in total. We know this without knowing the total mines because in Minesweeper there are always a greater number of unmined cells than mined cells. See this question & answer for a detailed explanation as to why the 104 combinations are not all equal weight Problem I want to calculate the odds of hitting a mine in any of the spaces. I will apply my original calculation & the new information to this board where the number of mines is known ( 25 ): N = number of mines = 25. T = number of unidentified squares = 124 ABFI,B,C..NOP,RSTUVWXY (All labeled squares minus M & Q) I'll refer to as Section1 The grey squares (including M & Q) I'll refer to as Section2 I've broken up the board into colour groups based on the probabilities. Every square in the green group will have the same probability. Every square in the grey group will have the same probability and so on. We know this based on the numbered squares the square is touching. For example, 'A' & 'B' both touch a '3'. There is no reason 'B' would have different odds than 'A'. I've labeled the board for my own sake, to be able to refer to the squares of interest ( M & Q are not interesting, they are part of section2 I just wanted a square of marked squares ) Based on this we know: Section1 can have 4, or 5 or 6 mines. Section2 can have 21, 20, or 19 mines. (Remember section2 is 'the rest' aka gray squares) I'll refer to what we know as 'Rules'. We know the total number of mines surrounding a '1' must equal '1'.

(R+S+T+U+V+W+X+Y)           =        1 Before collecting every possible combination, Let's look at the formula for assigning weights (Found in the 'question & answer' linked at the top, Credit to user Joriki in the linked answer): m = remaining mines (25)
t = remaining unidentified squares (124)
n = mines assigned
s = assigned squares Let's assume Section1 has 4 mines (Section2 must have the remaining 21): m = 25
t = 124
n = 4
s = 23 (Remember M & Q are not part of this section).

124 - 23 = 101
25 - 4 = 21
101 ncr 21 = 2577824781465941808570 Assuming Section1 has 5 mines: m = 25
t = 124
n = 5
s = 23

124 - 23 = 101
25 - 5 = 20
101 ncr 20 = 668324943343021950370 Finally, assuming Section1 has 6 mines: m = 25
t = 124
n = 6
s = 23

124 - 23 = 101
25 - 6 = 19
101 ncr 19 = 163006083742200475700 Calculating all of the possibilities (I refer to these as 'Scenarios') the same way we've done in the original post tells us there are 6 different possibilities for Section1: #:      A1  A12 A21 A22 A23 A24

TOTALS: 4   18  6   24  4   48

Total combinations = 104 Note: In the above table, to get 'TOTALS' we multiply all combinations to get the total combinations for that solution. Tallying up the number of mines for the known sections we see there are 1 scenerios where the sections contains 6 mines, 2 scenarios which have 4 mines and 3 that have 5 mines. To normalize the weights: 3 * 2577824781465941808570 = 7.7334743e+21
2 * 668324943343021950370 = 1.3366499e+21
1 * 163006083742200475700 = 163006083742200475700 

7.7334743e+21 + 1.3366499e+21 + 163006083742200475700  = 9.2331303e+21

2577824781465941808570 / 9.2331303e+21 = 0.279%
668324943343021950370 / 9.2331303e+21 = 0.072%
163006083742200475700 / 9.2331303e+21 = 0.018% So, for each 'scenario' for section1, we can assign the weights: 4 mine scenarios weight = 0.279%
5 mine scenarios weight = 0.072%
6 mine scenarios weight = 0.018% Since 'Section1' is nearly identical to the scenario in my last question I can take the results but apply the weights: m (number of mines), divide by t (squares) times c (total combinations for the solution) multiplied by the weight (based on total mines for the solution. 4 is 0.279, 5 is 0.072, 6 is 0.018) A11 Colour   m/t * c      Weight      Result

3463645,Proof Verification - divisibility through induction,"I'm studying for a final and was wondering if this proof is correct. I've seen several variants but they all seem less logical, so I want to make sure I'm not overlooking something. The proof is essentially:
Prove, using induction that $5 | 11^{n} - 6$ , for all positive integers n Here is my proof:
Base case, n = 1 $11^1 - 6 = 5$ which is divisible by 5. Inductive hypothesis:: Assume the proposition is true for some $k \in Z^{+}$ , or 5| $11^k - 6$ Inductive step: Prove, using the assumption made in the previous step that $5 | 11^{k+1} - 6$ From our inductive hypothesis we know that there exists some positive integer a such that 5a = $11^{k} - 6$ $5 | 11^{k+1} - 6 $ $11^{k+1} - 6 $ = $11^k * 11^1 - 6$ but, we know that 5a = $11^k - 6$ , so substituting, we get: $11*5a = 55a$ , which is a factor of 5. Thus, the proposition holds.","['induction', 'solution-verification', 'divisibility', 'discrete-mathematics']"
3463694,Do we need to show that a function is globally one to one for change of coordinates?,"I was wondering, when we apply the change of coordinates for an integral, if we need to show that the transformation is globally one-to-one. If it is simply a linear transformation, if the determinant Jacobian is not 0, then it is globally one-to-one. However, if the transformation is not linear, then the Jacobian not being 0 simply shows that it is locally one-to-one. However, do I need to show that the function is globally one-to-one, within the bounds of the integral? Also, is there any advice on how to do this? I am not even sure how to show that something like the spherical coordinates is one to one within some bounds.

3463722,Subgroups of order $8$ in a group of order $56$,"Let $G$ be a group of order $56$ and let $P$ and $Q$ be subgroups of $G$ of order $8$ . Prove that $P \cap Q \neq \{e\}$ . Here is my thinking thus far: We begin by using the Sylow Theorems. Let $|G| = 56 = 2^3 \cdot 7$ . Denote $n_2, n_7$ by the number of $2$ -Sylow subgroups and the number of $7$ -Sylow subgroups, respectively. Then we have $n_2 | 7$ and $n_2 \equiv 1$ (mod $2$ ) and $n_7|8$ and $n_7 \equiv 1$ (mod $7$ ) $\Rightarrow n_2 = 1$ or $7$ and $n_7 = 1$ or $8$ . We note that each of the $2$ -Sylow subgroups has order $8$ . By a simple counting argument of the number of elements in $|G|$ , it's easy to show that $n_2 = 7$ and $n_7 = 8$ is not possible. That leaves us with three possibilities -- $n_2 = 1$ and $n_7 = 1$ , $n_2 = 1$ and $n_7 = 8$ , or $n_2 = 7$ and $n_7 = 1$ . By nature of the question, though, since $P$ and $Q$ are subgroups of $G$ of order $8$ , they are telling us that $n_2 = 1$ is not desired. Thus, we are left with the case $n_2 = 7$ and $n_7 = 1$ . I'm struggling now with showing that $n_2 = 7$ and $n_7 = 1$ gives that, for two $2$ -Sylow subgroups $P$ and $Q$ of $G$ , $P \cap Q \neq \{e\}$ . Suppose $P \cap Q = \{e\}$ . Then, by a counting argument, we get $7(7) = 49$ non-identity elements in $G$ coming from the $2$ -Sylow subgroups, and $6(1) = 6$ nonidentity elements in $G$ coming from the unique $7$ -Sylow subgroup. This gives $49 + 6 = 55$ nonidentity elements in $G$ . Plus the identity element in $G$ this gives exactly 56 elements. So, by a counting argument, I don't see the problem with $P \cap Q = \{e\}$ occuring. How can I reach the desired contradiction? Thanks!","['group-theory', 'sylow-theory']"
3463784,Exponential notation for group homomorphisms,"I recently saw in The Theory of Finite Groups by Kurzweil and Stellmacher a different notation for writing homomorphisms. Consider a group homomorphism $f: G \rightarrow H$ . Usually we write $f(g)$ to indicate the element which $f$ maps $g$ to (although I've also seen it written $(g)f$ . This textbook writes the homomorphism as $g^f$ . I was curious to see if there were any explanations of why this notation is used and/or how common it is. I do realize that the following are true: $$
(gh)^f=g^fh^f
$$ $$
(g^{-1})^f = (g^f)^{-1}
$$ and so we see that this exponential notation for homomorphisms displays many of the rules that we would expect exponents to have. However, this just doesn't seem worth it to me because For students first learning group theory, it's probably more important to think of group homomorphisms as a kind of function. Learning the basic properties of homomorphisms isn't so difficult and so thinking that homomorphisms share many properties with exponents isn't terribly useful, and possibly a source of confusion. However, in order for the notation to appear in a textbook, there must be some kind of reason for it. So, thoughts?","['notation', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
3463787,How my professor derived this CDF?,"This was an example problem my professor went over in class. Let $X =$ uniform $(1,4)$ where $Y=(X-2)^2$ Find the CDF.

3463821,Why is the degree of a Weil divisor meaningless?,"Let $X$ be a irreducible smooth proper scheme over a field $k$ . The group of Weil divisors is the free abelian group on the set of prime divisors (irreducible closed subschemes of codimension 1). Thus, any Weil divisor $D$ can be written as a finite sum $D = \sum_i n_i[Y_i]$ where $Y_i$ is prime divisor. Let $baddegree(D) := \sum_i n_i$ . I want to understand why baddegree is not meaningful. Here are some explicit questions: (1). Suppose $k$ is algebraically closed. What is the simplest explicit example of $X$ and a function $f$ on $X$ with $baddegree(div(f)) \ne 0$ (where $div(f)$ is as defined in Hartshorne) (2). Intuitively, why do such functions as in (1) exist? (3). If $k$ is not algebraically closed, baddegree is already bad, even for curves. For example on $\mathbb{P}^1_k$ with coordinate $t$ , $baddegree(div(t^2+1)) = -1$ . Is there some sense in which this badness is related to the badness that appears for higher dimensional varieties?",['algebraic-geometry']

3463846,"Determine, by its action on an orthonormal basis, whether a linear operator can be continuous","We have a set of scalars $(A_{ij}\mid i,j\in\mathbb N)$ , which are supposed to be the coefficients of a continuous linear operator $A$ on a real Hilbert space, with respect to an orthonormal basis $(e_i\mid i\in\mathbb N)$ . $$x=\sum_ix_ie_i\mapsto Ax=\sum_{i,j}A_{ij}x_je_i$$ $$A_{ij}=e_i\cdot Ae_j$$ When is this possible? How can we tell from $A_{ij}$ whether this produces a well-defined continuous operator? Here are some necessary results of continuity: $$\sup_{i,j}|A_{ij}|<\infty$$ $$\forall j,\quad\lVert Ae_j\rVert^2=\sum_iA_{ij}^2<\infty$$ $$\sup_j\lVert Ae_j\rVert^2=\sup_j\sum_iA_{ij}^2<\infty$$ Here are some sufficient conditions: $$\max\{i+j\mid A_{ij}\neq0\}<\infty$$ $$\sum_{i,j}A_{ij}^2<\infty$$ $$\sum_{i,j}|A_{ij}|<\infty$$ $$\bigg(\sup_j\sum_i|A_{ij}|\bigg)\bigg(\sup_i\sum_j|A_{ij}|\bigg)<\infty$$ Is any such expression necessary and sufficient? Of course we need precisely $$\lVert A\rVert^2=\sup_{x\neq0}\frac{\lVert Ax\rVert^2}{\lVert x\rVert^2}=\sup_{x\neq0}\frac{\sum_i\left(\sum_jA_{ij}x_j\right)^2}{\sum_ix_i^2}<\infty$$ and we can take $x$ to be in the countable dense set ( $\cong c_{00}\cap\mathbb Q^\mathbb N\subset\ell^2$ ) of finite, rational, linear combinations of $e_i$ . But this seems difficult to work with. The adjoint $A^*$ has the same operator norm $\lVert A^*\rVert=\lVert A\rVert$ , so $A$ is bounded if and only if $A^*$ is bounded. And $\lVert A^*A\rVert=\lVert A\rVert^2$ , so $A$ is bounded if and only if $A^*A$ is bounded. Thus, we need only to consider symmetric positive-semidefinite operators. $$S=A^*A;\quad S_{ij}=\sum_kA_{ki}A_{kj}$$ Re la ted .","['hilbert-spaces', 'linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis', 'unbounded-operators', 'upper-lower-bounds']"
3463970,Intuitively Understanding Double Dual of a Vector Space,"I am trying to see if someone can help me understand the isomorphism between $V$ and $V''$ a bit more intuitively . I understand that the dual space of $V$ is the set of linear maps from $V$ to $\mathbb{F}$ . i.e. $V' = \mathcal{L}(V, \mathbb{F})$ . Therefore, double dual of $V$ , is the set of linear maps from $V'$ to $\mathbb{F}$ , or $V'' = \mathcal{L}(V', \mathbb{F})$ .
That is to say, the $V''$ is the set of linear functionals on linear functionals on $V$ . The part that gets me tripped up is the natural isomorphism $\varphi: V \rightarrow  V''$ , where $\varphi(v)(f)=f(v)$ for $f \in V'$ . I know how the proof that this is a isomorphism goes, but I am having trouble understanding it intuitively. I think of an isomorphism as a bijective map that tells me how to ""relabel"" elements in the domain to elements in the codomain.
For example, the subspace $\{(0,y) | y \in \mathbb{R} \} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is isomorphic with the subspace $\{(x,0) | x \in \mathbb{R} \} \subset \mathbb{R^2}$ . One particular isomorphism is the map $T: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $(0,y) \mapsto (y,0)$ . It's clear that the rule says: take the input, and flip the coordinates. In particular, it tells me how to go from one vector space to the other clearly. However, when I try to figure out what the rule is for $\varphi: V \rightarrow  V''$ in words, I'm a little stuck. $\varphi$ takes any $v \in V$ and finds a unique map $g \in \mathcal{L}(V', \mathbb{F})$ . How does it ""find"" this unique map $g$ ? The definition $\varphi(v)(f)=f(v)$ seems to only describe what you do with $g$ , which is evaluate it with the input $f$ and $v$ - it doesn't tell me what this $g$ is, in way that's equally satisfying like the example with $\mathbb{R}^2$ above. Another way to pose my question is, how would you define $\varphi:V \rightarrow V''$ using the ""maps to"" symbol? $v \mapsto .....?$ I'm not sure what should be in the place of the .....","['linear-algebra', 'dual-spaces']"

3464065,Show that there are infinitely many natural numbers such that $a^2+b^2=c^2+3 .$,"This question was asked in the Crux Mathematicorum , October edition , Pg - $5$ , which can found be Here. The question states that : Both $4$ and $52$ can be expressed as the sum of two squares as well as
  exceeding another square by $3$ : $$4 = 0^2+2^2 \quad\,, \, 4-3=1^2 $$ $$52 = 4^2+6^2 \quad\,, \, 52-3=7^2 $$ Show that there are an infinite number of such numbers that have these two
  characteristics. My attempt : I Found $4,52$ and $292$ to have this characteristics. An interesting feature I noticed was $$4 = \color{red}{0^2}+2^2 \quad\,, \, 4-3=\color{green}{1^2}$$ $$52 =4^2 + \color{red}{6^2} \quad\,, \, 52-3=\color{green}{7^2}$$ $$292 = 6^2 + \color{red}{16^2} \quad\,, \, 292-3=\color{green}{17^2}$$ If a number $y$ satisfies this property , then it might be written as : $$y= a^2+b^2 = c^2+3$$ And based on the above examples , I conjectured that : $$(k)^2 + b ^2 = (k+1)^2 + 3$$ where $a=k$ and $c=k+1$ . This expression on simplifying gives us : $b^2 = 2(k+2)$ . For R.H.S to be a perfect square , $(k+2)$ must be of the form $2x^2$ , which on solving ,  gives $k = 2x^2-2$ and $b$ comes out to be $2x$ . So a solution is given by $\color{blue}{(a,b,c) = (2x^2-2,2x,2x^2-1)}$ And our number becomes $y = 4(x^4 - x^2 + 1)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{N}$ and hence there are infinite numbers with this characteristics. Although ' maybe ' this proves the question , it is not quite rigorous method to do this . Also , it does not provide all the possible numbers as we have only taken the special case when $a=k \,\,, c= k+1$ . What is the better way to solve this problem and the general formula for the number? Bonus Question : Prove that the highest power of two dividing the number is $2.$ Or more generally ,show that : $$2^c\nmid y \quad \quad \text { For any } c \ge 3.$$ Verified it for all $y\le1.5\times10^5$ and it seems quite likely to be true . For my case , where $y = 4(x^4 - x^2 +1)$ , this is obvious as $x^4-x^2+1$ is always odd and hence the number is only divisible by $4$ . But what about the other numbers ? Edit : The first $5$ numbers with this characteristics are : $$4 = 0^2+2^2 \quad\,, \, 4-3={1^2}$$ $$52 =4^2 + {6^2} \quad\,, \, 52-3=7^2$$ $$292 = 6^2 + {16^2} \quad\,, \, 292-3={17^2}$$ $$628 = 12^2 + {22^2} \quad\,, \, 628-3={25^2}$$ $$964 = 8^2 + {30^2} \quad\,, \, 964-3={31^2}$$","['contest-math', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'recreational-mathematics', 'algebra-precalculus']"

Then $\Psi = T \cup \Phi_1 \cup \Phi_2$ is inconsistent. By compactness, there must be an inconsistent finite subset $\Psi_0 \subset \Psi$ . In particular, $\Psi_0$ can only contain finitely many formulas of $\Phi_1$ , referencing only finitely many primes. Let $M \subset Primes$ be the set of primes being referenced, and $\Pi M$ the product of all primes in $M$ . Then for any $i\ge 1$ , the numbers $i\cdot \Pi M-1$ and $i\cdot \Pi M+1$ are coprime to M.

That is, $x \geq 6$ isn't the union of the two original inequalities, nor is it their intersection; but what is it? When I ""solve"" a system of inequalities in this way, what exactly is it that I even do? What does this result set mean, in relation to the original inequalities that I ""solved"", and why does it qualify as a ""solution"" at all? I do understand why if $a \gt b$ and $c \gt d$ then $a + c \gt b + d$ ; it makes perfect sense that the sum of two greater numbers would be greater than the sum of two smaller numbers. But other than that, I can't put into words the relationship of the first two and the result. Some background information, to maybe help clarify what I ask:
I had constructed the following four inequalities and wanted to algebrically show that they are true only if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers that are larger than $1$ . $$\begin{align*}
a  b &\gt 0\\  
a + b &\gt 0\\  
ab &\gt a\\  
ab &\gt b
\end{align*}$$ Logically, I can definitely explain to myself why that is true (unless it isn't and I'm being silly, in which case, please do feel free to tell me so): the first two inequalities prove that $a$ & $b$ are positive, and the latter two prove that they're larger than 1. But when I tried to ""solve"" this as a system of inequalities -- i.e, add those inequalities to each other -- I realized that the final result is that $ab \gt 0$ , and I couldn't exactly explain to myself what this ""solution"" even has to do with the inequalities it's composed of. I did, at that point, understand that an addition like that was not equivalent to an intersection, but that's about all I did understand.","['algebra-precalculus', 'inequality']"

The exercise problem is relatively simple: Find the solution for the following ODE: $$y' = 1 - y^2$$ I'm experiencing some confusion regarding the solution. Probably because it's been a very long time since I've studied calculus. My approach is: $$
\begin{align}
y' & = 1 - y^2 \\
\frac{1}{1 - y^2}y' & = 1 \\
\int \frac{1}{1 - y^2}\,dy & = \int 1 \, dx \\
\end{align}
$$ Solving the integral on the left: $$
\begin{align}
\int \frac{1}{1 - y^2}\,dy & = \int \left( \frac{1}{2(1 + y)} + \frac{1}{2(1 - y)} \right)\,dy \\
& = \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{1}{1 + y}\,dy + \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{1}{1 - y}\,dy \\
& = \frac{1}{2} \ln(\vert1 + y\vert) + \frac{1}{2} \ln{(\vert 1 - y\vert)} + C
\end{align}
$$ And therefore I concluded that the solution to the ODE is: $$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2} \ln{(\vert 1 + y \vert)} + \frac{1}{2} \ln(\vert 1 - y \vert ) & = x + C \\ 
\ln(\vert 1 + y \vert) + \ln(\vert 1 - y \vert) & = 2x + C \\
\ln(\vert 1 - y^2 \vert ) & = 2x + C \\
\vert 1 - y^2 \vert & = Ce^{2x}
\end{align}
$$ and therefore: $$
y = 
\begin{cases}
\begin{align}
\sqrt{-Ce^{2x} + 1} && 1 - y^2 \ge 0 \\
\sqrt{Ce^{2x} + 1} && 1 - y^2 \lt 0
\end{align}
\end{cases}
$$ However, the solution is simply: $$
y = \tanh{(x + C)}
$$ My questions are the following: How should I be able to recognize that apparently the integral that the solution uses to go to $\tanh$ is a standard integral? I've thought of ways that I could derive it, but other than memorization it seems difficult to find the connection. When do I know whether or not to include the absolute values for the solutions when a natural logarithm is involved?

3465523,"A triangle's sides are integers, and its circumradius is a prime number. Prove that the triangle is right-angled.","The lengths of the sides of a triangle are integers, whereas the radius of its circumscribed circle is a prime number. Prove that the triangle is right-angled. Solution: We'll use three well-known formulas for the area of $\triangle ABC$ : $$[ABC]=\frac{abc}{4R}=\frac{ab\sin C}{2}=\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}.$$ First of all, because $a,b,c,R$ are all integers, we know that $[ABC]$ is rational. But then $$4[ABC]=\sqrt{2s(2s-2a)(2s-2b)(2s-2c)}\in\mathbb{Z}$$ (since $2s(2s-2a)(2s-2b)(2s-2c)$ is an integer, its square root, if it is rational, must be an integer) so $[ABC]=n/4$ for some $n\in\mathbb{Z}.$ Then $n=abc/R$ is an integer, so $R$ divides one of $a,b,c$ ; WLOG $a=kR$ for some $k\in\mathbb{Z}.$ But now $$\frac{abc}{4R}=\frac{bc\sin A}{2}\implies\sin A=\frac{a}{2R}=\frac{k}{2}$$ and since $\sin A\in[0,1]$ we have $k\in\{1,2\}.$ If $k=1$ then we have from Law of Cosines $$a^2=R^2=b^2+c^2-2bc\cos A=b^2+c^2-bc\sqrt{3},$$ which is absurd because $R,b,c$ are all integers. So $k=2\implies\sin A=1\implies A=90^{\circ}$ and we are done. Is there a cooler solution than this? I found it slightly ridiculous","['number-theory', 'geometry', 'euclidean-geometry']"

Seeing all problems, I come up with the third proof. Let $f=T_2^{-1}T_1$ , let $Q^n$ be the standard simplex in $\mathbb{R}^n$ , $\sigma_0$ be the standard positively oriented n-simplex in $\mathbb{R}^n$ , now $f(Q^n)=Q^n$ . Proof ( $3$ rd): $f$ is a diffeomorphism on $Q^n$ . Since $f$ is diffeomorphism, the topological boundary of $Q^n$ is mapped to itself. Now it is defined that $\partial f=f(\partial \sigma_0)$ is the positively oriented boundary. Since jacobian of $f$ $\gt 0$ , $f(\sigma_0)$ have same orientation as $\sigma_0$ , $f$ preserves orientation also on its boundary. Hence $\partial f= \partial \sigma_0$ . Edit: All previous proofs are deleted as I thought they are either erroneous or a rephrase of the $3$ rd proof.

3465630,What fraction is shaded?,"Conrguent $\frac{5}{6}$ circles in a circle. What fraction is shaded? ] 1 Solution: Let $r$ be the radius of the small circles and $R$ the radius of the big one. The colored section is three times five sixths of the area of one of the small circles. Colored Section area= $3\times\dfrac{5}{6}\times\pi r^2=\dfrac{5\pi r^2}{2}$ The radius $R$ of the big circle is equal to $r$ plus the radius of the circumscribed circle of equailateral triangle ABC, whose side is $2r$ .
The radius of the circumscribed circle of an equilateral triangle is the length of the sides divided by $\sqrt{3}$ . Since the side here measures $2r$ , the radius of the circumscribed circle is $\dfrac{2r}{\sqrt{3}}$ . So we have $R = r+\dfrac{2r}{\sqrt{3}}$ The area of the big circle is $\pi \times R^2$ , which here is equal to $(r+\dfrac{2r}{\sqrt{3}})^2$ which, when expanded, gives Big Circle area = $\dfrac{\pi r^2(7+4\sqrt{3})}{3}$ To obtain the shaded fraction, we need to divide the area of the colored region by the area of the big circle: Shaded fraction = $\dfrac{\dfrac{5\pi r^2}{2}}{\dfrac{\pi r^2(7+4\sqrt{3})}{3}}$ Shaded fraction = $\dfrac{5\pi r^2}{2} \times \dfrac{3}{\pi r^2(7+4\sqrt{3})}$ Shaded fraction = $\dfrac{15}{2(7+4\sqrt{3})} \simeq 53.847 \% $ I think it's wrong.

3465671,Derivative and calculus over sets such as the rational numbers,"I am interested in the derivative of a function defined on a subset $S$ of $[0, 1]$ . The subset in question is dense in $[0, 1]$ but has Lebesgue measure zero. My actual question can be found at the bottom of this post. There has been a few questions on the subject, but none leading to something interesting as far as I am concerned. See here , here (concept of arithmetic derivative) and also here (Minkowski's question mark function, related to the material discussed here.) Generally these discussions lead to some kind of non-sense math. Here it is the opposite. I have a framework that does work as far as applications and computations are concerned, but I have a hard time putting it into some sound mathematical framework. It would have to be some kind of non-standard calculus. Perhaps the simplest example (though I have plenty of other similar cases) is as follows. Let $Z$ be a random variable defined as follows: $$Z = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{X_k}{2^k}$$ where the $X_k$ 's are identically and independently
distributed with a Bernouilli $(p)$ distribution. Thus $P(X_k = 1) = p$ and $P(X_k = 0) = 1-p$ . Here $0 < p < 1$ . In short, the $X_k$ 's are the binary digits of the random number $Z$ . There are two cases. Case $p=\frac{1}{2}$ In this case, $Z$ has a uniform distribution on $S$ , where $S$ is the set of normal numbers in $[0, 1]$ . It is known that $S$ has Lebesgue measure $1$ , and that $S$ is dense in $[0, 1]$ . Yet it is full of holes (no rational number is is a normal number due to their periodicity, thus the $X_k$ 's are not independent for rational numbers.) This is the simplest case. One might wonder if the density $f_Z$ (the derivative of the distribution $F_Z$ ) exists. Yet $f_Z(z) = 1$ if $z \in S$ works perfectly well for all purposes. It can easily be extended to $f_Z(z) = 1$ if $z \in [0, 1]$ . Let us denote the extended function as $\tilde{f}_Z$ . You can compute all the moments using the extended $\tilde{f}_Z$ and get the right answer. If $s$ is a positive real number, then $$E(Z^s) = \int_0^1 z^s \tilde{f}_Z(z) dz = \frac{1}{s+1}.$$ You could argue that $\tilde{f}_Z$ (and thus $f_Z$ ) can be obtained by inverting the above functional equation, using some kind of Laplace transform. So we can bypass the concept of derivative entirely, it seems. Case $p\neq \frac{1}{2}$ Now we are dealing with a hard nut to crack, and a wildly chaotic system: $Z$ 's support domain is a set $S'$ that is a subset of non-normal numbers in $[0, 1]$ . This set $S'$ has now Lebesgue measure zero, yet it is dense in $[0, 1]$ . For the distribution, it is not a problem: even discrete random variables have a distribution $F_Z$ defined for all positive real numbers: $F_Z(z) = P(Z \leq z)$ . The issue is with the density $f_Z = dF_Z/dz$ . It sounds either it should be zero everywhere or not exist. My guess is that you might be able to define a new, workable concept of density. In the neighborhood of every point $z \in S'$ , it looks like $g(z,h) = (F_Z(z+h) - F_Z(z))/h$ oscillates infinitely many times with no limit as $h\rightarrow 0$ , yet these oscillations are bounded most of the time, perhaps leading to the fact that averaging $g(z, h)$ around $h = 0$ , using smaller and smaller values of $h$ , could provide a sound definition for the density $f_Z$ . Again, despite the chaotic nature of the system (see how the the would-be density could potentially look like in the picture below) all the following quantities exist and can be computed exactly and then confirmed by empirical evidence, even though the integrals below may not make sense: $$E(Z) = \int_{0}^{1} z f_Z(z) dz = p \\
E(Z^2) = \int_{0}^{1} z^2 f_Z(z) dz =\frac{p}{3}(1+2p)\\
E(Z^3) = \int_{0}^{1} z^3 f_Z(z) dz =\frac{p}{7}(1+4p+2p^2)\\
E(Z^4) = \int_{0}^{1} z^4 f_Z(z) dz =\frac{p}{105}(7+46p + 44p^2+8p^3)
$$ Indeed, a general formula for $E(Z^s) = \int_0^1 z^s f_Z(z)dz$ is available for $s \geq 0$ , defined by the following functional equation (see here ): $$E(Z^s) = \frac{p}{2^s-1+p}\cdot E((1+Z)^s) .$$ In other words, we would have, under some appropriate calculus theory with a sound definition of integral and derivative: $$\int_{S'}z^s f_Z(z)dz  = \frac{p}{2^s-1+p}\cdot\int_{S'}(1+z)^s f_Z(z) dz .$$ Here is how the density $f_Z$ , if properly defined, could look like for $p=0.75$ (see here and here ): Below is the empirical percentile distribution, for this particular $Z$ : Other related problems If instead, we consider the model $Z = X_1 + X_1 X_2 + X_1 X_2 X_3 + \cdots$ with $X$ Bernouilli $(p)$ , then $Z$ has a geometric distribution of parameter $1-p$ , see section 2.2 in this article . This system is also equivalent to the binary numeration system discussed so far: see section 5 in the same article. It results in $Z$ having a standard, well-known discrete distribution. But if this time $P(X=-0.5) = 0.5 = P(X=0.5)$ then $Z$ is uniform on a subset $S$ of $[-1, 1]$ , with $S$ also full of holes. Here is another interesting model: $$Z=\sqrt{X_1+\sqrt{X_2+\sqrt{X_3+\cdots}}}$$ The distribution for $X$ is as follows: $$P(X=0) = \frac{1}{2}, P(X=1) = \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{5}}, P(X=2) = \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \mbox{ } (\star)$$ This corresponds to a different numeration system, and the choice for $X$ 's distribution is not arbitrary, see here : in short, it makes the system smoother and possibly easier to solve. To the contrary $P(X=0) = P(X=1)=$ $P(X=2)= \frac{1}{3}$ yields a far more chaotic system, and the case $P(X=0) =$ $P(X=1) = \frac{1}{2}$ is so wild that the support domain of $Z$ has huge gaps, very visible to the naked eye. Normal numbers in the nested square root system are very different from normal numbers in the binary numeration system. The successive digits have a very specific auto-correlation structure, and the digits $0, 1, 2$ are not evenly distributed for normal numbers in that system. It is clear that if we assume that the $X_k$ 's are i.i.d, then $Z$ is not a normal number in that system. Yet we get a very good approximation for $F_Z$ , much smoother (at least visually) than in the binary numeration system investigated earlier, with $p\neq \frac{1}{2}$ . In particular, $F_Z$ is very well approximated by a log function, see chart below. Here the blue line is the empirical distribution for $Z$ , the red line is the log approximation. And below is a spectacular chart, featuring the approximation error $\epsilon(z) = F_Z(z) -\log_2(z)$ . It's a fractal! (source: see section 2.2 in this article ). In short, it is no more differentiable than a Brownian motion, and technically, the derivative $f_Z$ does not exist. Yet all moments of $Z$ can be computed exactly from the functional equation attached to that system ( $F_{Z^2}=F_{X+Z}$ ) and confirmed empirically. Even though the distribution looks smooth to the naked eye, we are dealing here with a very chaotic system in disguise. Again we need non-standard calculus to handle the density, whose support is a dense set of Lebesgue measure zero in $[1, 2]$ . Since fractals are nowhere differentiable, $f_Z$ does not exist. Yet one could imagine a ""density"" that would look like $f_Z(z)=\frac{1}{z\log 2}$ for $z\in [1,2]$ . My question Is there an existing theory to handle this type of density-like-substance?

3466052,How to prove this series converges (possibly by modifying the Dirichlet test)?,"I am trying to prove convergence of the series $(1) \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin(n)}{\sqrt{n}+\sin(n)}$ . If this series were $(2) \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin(n)}{\sqrt{n}}$ , then it converges by the Dirichlet test because partial sums of $\sin(n)$ are bounded and $1/\sqrt{n}$ decreases monotonically to $0$ . The difficulty I have is that $\sqrt{n}+ \sin(n)$ in the denominator is not monotonic and $\sin(n)$ in the numerator changes sign. But the denominator is bracketed by monotonic sequences $\sqrt{n} - 1 \leq \sqrt{n} + \sin(n) \leq \sqrt{n} + 1$ and it seems possible to adapt the Dirichlet test. Can this be done to prove convergence of (1) or is there a more general approach that I am not aware of?","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
3466093,Find Harmonic Numbers for Imaginary and Complex Values,"The Normal definition of Harmonic numbers with $ n \in \mathbb{N} $ is $$ H_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k} \tag{1}\label{eq1A} $$ This can be expanded to $ n \in \mathbb{C} $ $$ H_n = \psi_0(n+1) + \gamma \tag{2}\label{eq2A}$$ Where $\psi_0(n)$ is the $0$ th degree Polygamma function, which is defined for complex values of n, and $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. So my question is there a general solution to $H_{ji}$ where $j \in \mathbb{N}  $ and $i$ is the imaginary unit? I considered in using the series formula of the Polygamma which is $$ \psi_0(z+1) = -\gamma + \sum_{n=1}^\infty(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+z}) \tag{3}\label{eq3A}$$ Simplify the $(2)$ with $(3)$ we get $$ H_{ji} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+ji}) \tag{4}\label{eq4A}$$ But I don't know how to simplify this series. I tried to use the function above and Wolfram Alpha just simplifies it back to $\psi_0(x+1) + \gamma $ so this type of method seems to just be dead end. Another method I have considered is the integral representation of $\psi_0(z)$ which is $$ \psi_0(z) = \int_0^\infty (e^{-t}-\frac{1}{(1+t)^z})\frac{dt}{t} \tag{5}\label{eq5A}$$ Which transforms our $(2)$ into $$ H_{ji} = \int_0^\infty (e^{-t}-{(1+t)^{-ji+1}})\frac{dt}{t} + \gamma \tag{6}\label{eq6A}$$ Expanding the integral int $(6)$ we get $$ H_{ji} = \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-t}}{t}dt - \int_0^\infty \frac{(1+t)^{-ji+1}}{t}dt + \gamma \tag{7}\label{e71A}$$ Which is just $$ H_{ji} = \Gamma(0) - \int_0^\infty \frac{(1+t)^{-ji+1}}{t}dt +\gamma \tag{8}\label{eq8A}$$ Where $ \Gamma(z) $ is the Gamma function . Seeing that $ \lim_{z\to 0} \Gamma(z) \rightarrow \infty $ and that the second integral doesn't converge there has to be some type of manipulation for $\Gamma(0)$ and the second integral to get a value of $H_{ji}$ . You can also use the identity of $ \psi(z+1) = \psi(z)+\frac{1}{z} $ to obtain for the previous function as $$H_{ji} = \Gamma(0) - \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{(1+t)^{ji}t}dt - \frac{i}{j} +\gamma\tag{9}\label{eq9A}$$ Letting $ 1+t = u $ we can see our $(9)$ will change to $$H_{ji} = \Gamma(0) - \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{u^{ji}(u-1)}du - \frac{i}{j} +\gamma \tag{10}\label{eq10A}$$ Doing partial fraction decomposition of $ \frac{1}{u^{ji}(u-1)} = \frac{A}{u^{ji}}+\frac{B}{u-1} $ we see that $$ A = -1 \\
 B = 1^{1-ji} \tag{11}\label{eq11A}$$ Expanding our $(10)$ with $(11)$ we get $$H_{ji} = \Gamma(0) - \int_1^\infty (\frac{1^{1-ji}}{u-1} - \frac{1}{u^{ji}})du - \frac{i}{j} +\gamma \tag{12}\label{eq12A}$$ Constructing $(12)$ into two integrals and simpifying we see find $$ H_{ji} = \Gamma(0) - \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{u-1} du - \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{u^{ji}} du - \frac{i}{j} + \gamma \tag{13}\label{eq13A}$$ But it is obvious that these two integrals don't converge to any value, so it seems that the partial fraction decomposition is also a dead end. Thanks to @AliShather, they noticed that the integral in $(8)$ is very closly related to the Beta function , where the beta function is $$ B(x,y) = \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{x-1}}{(1+t)^{x+y}}dt = \frac{\Gamma(x)\Gamma(y)}{\Gamma(x+y)} \Re\{x,y\}>0 \tag{14}\label{eq14A}$$ Comparing this to the integral in $(8)$ we can see that $\Re\{x,y\} \ngtr 0$ , but very close!

3466195,Why Can we Write the Ray Class Group as a Quotient of Monoids,"In the book Elliptic Functions , Lang uses a definition for the ray class group of a number field that I'm not completely comfortable with. I'm trying to understand why his definition is justified. For context, I normally think of the ray class group of a number field $k$ in the following way. Let $\mathfrak f$ be a fractional ideal of $k$ . Let $F(\mathfrak f)$ be the group of fractional ideals prime to $\mathfrak f$ and let $S(\mathfrak f)$ be the subgroup of principal ideals generated by elements in the ray modulo $\mathfrak f$ . Then define the ray class group modulo $\mathfrak f$ as the quotient group $F(\mathfrak f)/S(\mathfrak f)$ . Here is Lang's definition when $k$ is quadratic imaginary. This occurs in Chapter 22 at the beginning of Section 2. Again let $k$ be an imaginary quadratic field with $\mathfrak o_k = \mathfrak o$ and let $\mathfrak f$ be an [integral] ideal of $\mathfrak o, \mathfrak f \neq \mathfrak o$ . Let $G_\mathfrak f = I(\mathfrak f)/P_1(\mathfrak f)$ be the ray class group where $I(\mathfrak f)$ denotes the monoid of [integral] ideals prime to $\mathfrak f$ , and $P_1(\mathfrak f)$ denotes the subset consisting of those principal ideals $(\alpha)$ such that $\alpha \equiv 1 \mod \mathfrak f$ . The key difference between this and how I think about the ray class group, is that Lang is working with integral ideals, and the set of integral ideals prime to $\mathfrak f$ forms a monoid, rather than a group. From the notation, I would guess that the set $I(\mathfrak f)/P(\mathfrak f)$ is the collection of cosets of the form $\mathfrak aP_1(\mathfrak f)$ for $\mathfrak a \in I(\mathfrak f)$ . But since $I(\mathfrak f)$ is not a group and $P_1(\mathfrak f)$ is not a subgroup, it is not even clear to me that the cosets $\mathfrak aP_1(\mathfrak f)$ actually form a partition of $I(\mathfrak f)$ in the first place. This, I think, is the heart of my issue with the definition. I think that I have shown that one can define an equivalence relation on $I(k)$ by saying $\mathfrak a \sim \mathfrak b$ if and only if there exist $(\alpha), (\beta) \in P_1(\mathfrak f)$ such that $\alpha\mathfrak a = \beta \mathfrak b$ , and in this case the set of equivalence classes do form a group which is isomorphic to $F(\mathfrak f)/S(\mathfrak f)$ , the ray class group as I normally think of it. This seems very related, but I'm not convinced on why it is the same as the definition given by Lang in terms of cosets. My Question: How is the set $I(\mathfrak f)/P_1(\mathfrak f)$ defined? Is it a collection of cosets, or something else? If it is just a collection of cosets, how exactly are the cosets defined, and how do we show that these cosets partition $I(\mathfrak f)$ ? Additional comments which may be relevant. From what I understand, if you have a monoid $M$ and a congruence $\sim$ on $M$ then the equivalence classes $M/\sim$ form a monoid. If $M$ is in fact a group then the set of congruences on $M$ are in one to one correspondence with normal subgroups of $M$ and so it makes sense to use the standard notation $M/N$ , where $N$ is some normal subgroup, for the equivalence classes. In general though if $M$ is not a group you do not have such a correspondence, and it doesn't make sense to define quotients in terms of submonoids like we do with subgroups. You must stick with using equivalence relations. However, here Lang seems to be using notation analogous to the notation that we use with groups, which really makes me think there is a natural equivalence relation that can be associated to the submonoid $P_1(\mathfrak f)$ . If this is true, it seems like the equivalence classes of this relation should just be the cosets $\mathfrak a P_1(\mathfrak f)$ .","['class-field-theory', 'number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

However, for irrational $x^2$ , I cannot find a proof or counterexample either way, however my knowledge of number theory is more than limited.

I was given good advice & answers pointed out some flaws in my calculation. However editing the original post would make the answers outdated. I've only modified the board slightly, adding another number so that simplifying a section is not possible. I did this because I'd like to ensure my calculation can apply to any board & makes sense in doing so. N = number of mines = 25 T = number of unidentified squares = 123 As you can see I've broken up the board into colored groups based on having identical odds so that It isn't necessary to calculate each square individually. For example, 'A', 'B', 'F' & 'I' are all touching a '3'. There is no reason 'A' would have different odds than 'B' 'F' or 'I'. I will split the squares into 2 sections: Section1 - Left marked section (ABFI, MNO, K...) Section2 - Right marked section (PTV,QRWX,SUY) Seciton3 - All the unknown squares. These are all the blank grey squares Based on the numbers we know that: Section1 + Section2 must have a sum of:  5, 6, 7 or 8 mines.

TOTALS:  2      3 Now we calculate the number of cases possible for every solution. This is done by using nCr ( Binomial coefficient ). Where N = Number of Squares and B = numberOfBombs. Combinations = N NCR B. For the first solution (S1-1) these are the cases: (ABFI)    = 4 NCR 1 = 4
(C)       = 1 NCR 1 = 1
(DEHL)    = 4 NCR 0 = 1
(G)       = 1 NCR 0 = 1
(J)       = 1 NCR 1 = 1
(K)       = 0 NCR 1 = 1
(MNO)     = 3 NCR 0 = 1 Multiplying these combinations we get: 4*1*1*1*1*1*1 = 4 cases for this solution (S1-1). Doing the same for all solutions in the left section we get: #:      S1-11 S1-12 S1-21 S1-22 S1-23 S1-24

TOTAL MINES:    5
TOTAL CASES:    16 Total cases is calculated by multiplying the binomial distribution for each group as we've done before Notice that I've taken the first case for S1 and added the first case for S2. If I were to continue, I'd write the first case for S1 + the second for S2, then the second case for S1 + the first for S2. These 2184 total cases do not hold equal weight . We know that there are 25 mines in the total & 123 unidentified squares. 25/123 = 0.20 mines per square. This means a case with 5 mines (the minimum) will have a different weight than a case with 8 mines (the maximum). Credit to Joriki in this answer for the formula $\binom{t-s}{m-n}\;.$ t = remaining unidentified squares (123) m = remaining mines (25) s = unidentified squares in case n = mines assigned to case Knowing that (Section1+Section) has 25 unidentified squares and may contain 5, 6, 7 or 8 mines we assign the weights: W1 (5 mines): $\binom{123-25}{25-5}\;$ = $\binom{98}{20}\;$ W2 (6 mines): $\binom{123-25}{25-6}\;$ = $\binom{98}{19}\;$ W3 (7 mines): $\binom{123-25}{25-7}\;$ = $\binom{98}{18}\;$ W4 (8 mines): $\binom{123-25}{25-8}\;$ = $\binom{98}{17}\;$ Before we carry on lets put our 2 sections into 1 ""FullSection"". We do this by ""Multiplying"" section2 & section1. By that I mean, for every solution in Section1, add every solution in Section2. Section1 has 6 solutions with total mines of: 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5. 
Section2 has 5 solutions with total mines of: 2, 3 'Full Solutions Table' (The section # isn't really important) Full Section # # of mines  # of cases

Total cases: 2184 For every solution, we will tally up how many times 5, 6, 7 & 9 mines are the sum: Cases with 5 mines: 120 Cases with 6 mines: 642 Cases with 7 mines: 990 Cases with 8 mines: 432 The sum of the weights (Using W1 - W4 depending on number of mines): (120 * $\binom{123-25}{25-5}\;$ ) + (642 * $\binom{123-25}{25-6}\;$ ) + (990 * $\binom{123-25}{25-7}\;$ ) + (432 * $\binom{123-25}{25-8}\;$ ) Sum of weights = 1.190143e+23 So given any case, say one with 5 mines in it, the probability will be: $\binom{123-25}{25-5}\;$ / 1.190143e+23 = 0.00287497486 Doing the same with 5, 6, 7, 8 5 = 0.00287497486
6 = 0.00072784173
7 = 0.00017286241
8 = 0.00003841386 Since there are 120 cases with 5 mines: 120 * 0.00287497486 = 0.3449969832 Again doing the same with 5, 6, 7, 8: 5 = 0.345
6 = 0.467
7 = 0.171
8 = 0.017
Sum:    1 We will be applying the single weight to every case, but I just wanted to ensure the sum is = 1 Applying these weights, we can create a table where the weight is based on the W for number of mines, multiplied by the number of cases and the value under each coloured group for the section represents the odds per square . E.G: for S1, the number of mines is 6 and there are 36 cases. The green section is 4 squares in length and contains 1 mine so: 0.00072784173 * 36 = 0.02620230228

[ Edit: Here a $G$ action on $V$ means a linear representation.] Is there a general way to describe the orbits of the group action of $G$ on $V$ in terms of the orbits of the $G_i$ action on $V_i$ ? ( Edit: if it is easier, one can assume the representation $V_i$ of $G_i$ is irreducible.) If the above question has no general answer, here is a more concrete one. Suppose that $G_1=GL_2(\mathbb C)$ and $V_1=\mathbb C^2$ . Suppose that $G_2$ acts on a complex vector space $V_2$ with 4 orbits $0, C_1,C_2,C_3$ , then is there a way to describe the orbits of the natural $G_1\times G_2$ action on $V_1\otimes_{\mathbb C}V_2 $ in terms of $C_1,C_2,C_3$ ? The following are some efforts I tried for the concrete example. The space $V_1\otimes V_2$ can be interpreted as $Hom_{\mathbb C}(V_1^*,V_2)\cong M_{2\times n}(\mathbb C)$ , where $n=dim V_2$ . The action of $G_1\times G_2$ on $Hom(V_1^*,V_2)$ is given by $(g_1,g_2).f=g_2fg_1^{-1}.$ We can consider the ranks of $f$ . If $rk(f)=0,$ there is only one orbit. If $rk(f)=1$ , there are 3 orbits depending on the image of $f$ . But I don't know what happened if $rk(f)=2$ . I am very confused about the last case. I am wondering if there is a general method to solve this kind problem. Thanks in advance.","['representation-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'group-theory', 'group-actions']"

Remark : The connection with the cited problem or more exactly the formulation given in the fourth line of the accepted solution by @Jethro is as follows. Points $P,Q,R,S$ correspond resp. to complex numbers $D,D+Cz,D+Cz+Bz^2,0$ where $z=re^{i\theta}$ is a complex root of equation $D+Cz+Bz^2+z^3=0$ with common angle $a=\pi-\alpha$ and lengthes $PQ=D,QR=Cr,RS=Br^2,SP=r^3$ .

I can see that $\lim_{n\to \infty}a_n=1$ .The proof below can be found in kaczor's book ""Problems in Mathematical Analysis I"".In fact,if $\frac1a\leqslant a_n,a_{n+1}\leqslant a$ ,then $\frac{1}{a}\leqslant a_{n+2}=\frac{2}{a_n+a_{n+1}}\leqslant a$ .Thus ,by the principle of induction ,the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is bounded.Put $$l=\varliminf_{n\to \infty}a_n,L=\varlimsup_{n\to \infty}a_n$$ then for an arbitrarily fixed $\varepsilon>0$ there exist $n_1,n_2\in\mathbb{N}$ ,such that \begin{align*}
a_n<L+\varepsilon ,for \;n>n_1\tag{i}\\
a_n>l-\varepsilon ,for\; n>n_2\tag{ii}
\end{align*} By (i), $a_{n+2}=\frac{2}{a_n+a_{n+1}}>\frac{1}{L+\varepsilon}$ , $n>n_1$ .Since the positive $\varepsilon$ can be arbitrarily small,we  get $l\geqslant \frac1L$ .In much the same way (ii) implies that $L\leqslant \frac1l$ .Thus $l=\frac1L$ .Let $\{n_k\}$ be a sequence of positive integers such that $\lim_{k\to \infty}a_{n_k+2}=L$ .We can assume that the sequences $\{a_{n_k+1}\}$ , $\{a_{n_k}\}$ and $\{a_{n_k-1}\}$ converge to $l_1,l_2$ and $l_3$ ,respectively.In fact ,if this is not the case,we can choose subsequences which do.By the definition of $\{a_n\}$ , $$l_1+l_2=\frac{2}{L}=2l,\;l_2+l_3=\frac{2}{l_1}$$ and since $l\leqslant l_1,l_2,l_3\leqslant L$ ,we get $l_1=l_2=l$ and $l_2=l_3=L$ .Hence $l=L$ .This and the equality $l=\frac1L$ imply that the sequence $\{a_n\}$ converges to $1$ . It's hard for me to prove $|a_n-1|<C\lambda^n$ ,I've been thinking about this for one day, but I don't have any clue.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

I'm not sure if either are correct, if any.","['brownian-motion', 'probability-theory']"
3466552,function defined by its derivative at a specific point,"I was solving a physics problem about a falling element that gets air resistance. In that case, the acceleration, which is the derivative of velocity, is defined as $$a=\frac{mg-bv}{m}$$ And, m,g,b is all a constant. Let's define a function $v(t)=\text{the velocity at the time t}$ Then, we can define the derivative of velocity( $a$ ) with the expression written above. Like this. $$\frac{dv(t)}{dt}=\frac{mg-bv(t)}{m}$$ Now, we can define the physics problem I was solving by pure math. Abstracted problem function v(t) is defined as $$v(t)=\frac{mg-m\frac{dv(t)}{dt}}{b}$$ Can v(t) be defined without using it's derivative?
If it can't, why? If it can, how can it be done, and what is the definition? I am new pretty new to calculus and also physics. This question might be a stupid or a simple question. In that case, sorry. Thanks in advance.","['physics', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
3466563,"Real, Complex, Quaternionic and Octonionic Projective spaces","Do Octonionic Projective spaces exist or defined similar to $\Bbb RP^n$ , $\Bbb CP^n$ , $\Bbb HP^n$ ? If so, are they symmetric spaces? I am asking this question because I've never seen Octonionic Projective spaces as examples of the Compact Rank One Symmetric Spaces or the manifolds of positive sectional curvature except its 2-dimensional case i.e. Cayley plane $\Bbb OP^2$ (or $\Bbb{Ca}P^2$ ). What can be say about $\Bbb OP^n$ (or $\Bbb{Ca}P^n$ )? Update: Please give a proof or a reference for non-existence of Octonionic Projective spaces for $n\geq 3$ .

The identity is given but I really want to know why $?$ Show that if $2^n -1$ is a prime , then $n$ is a prime . [ Hint : Use the identity] $$2^{ab} -1 = (2^a-1)\cdot(2^{a(b-1)} + 2^{a(b-2)} + \cdots + 2^a +1 )$$",['discrete-mathematics']
