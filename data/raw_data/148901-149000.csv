2460548,Failure of Riesz Theorem for L-infinity,"Consider $L^{\infty }([0,1]).$ This prelim exercise is as in the title and the hint is to use Hahn-Banach. I would appreciate feedback. Here is my attempt: Suppose, toward a contradiction, that every $T\in \left ( L^{\infty }([0,1]) \right )^{*}$ is of the form $T(f))=\int_{0}^{1}f\cdot hdx$ for some $h\in L^{1}([0,1]).$ Observe that $C([0,1)]$ is a linear subspace of $L^{\infty }([0,1])$ so if we define for each $f\in C([0,1)]$ the functional $T:f\to f(0)$, we can extend it via Hahn-Banach to all of $L^{\infty }([0,1]).$ Then, there is $h\in L^{1}([0,1])$ such that $f(0)=\int_{0}^{1}f\cdot hdx.$ If $\int_{0}^{1}hdx=0$ we may take $f=1$ to arrive at a contradiction. Otherwise $E=\left \{ h\neq 0 \right \}\subseteq [0,1]$ satisfies $\lambda (E)> 0.$ Now consider for each integer $n$, $E_n=[0+1/n,1] \cap E$. If $\lambda (E_n)=0$ for all $n$, then continuity of the measure implies that $\lambda(E)=\lim \lambda(E_n)\setminus \lambda(E\cap\left \{ 0 \right \})=0, $ so in fact some $E_n:=E'$ must satisfy $\lambda(E')>0.$ Furthermore, there is an open set $U$ disjoint from $\left \{ 0 \right \}$ and a compact set $K$ such that $K\subseteq E'\subseteq U$ and $\lambda (E'\setminus K)<\lambda (E')/2$ and $\lambda (U\setminus E')<\lambda (E')/2.$ To finish, choose a continuous function such that $f(K)=\left \{ 1 \right \}$ and $f(U^c)=\left \{ 0\right \}$  Then $f(0)=0$ but $\int_{0}^{1}f\cdot hdx\neq 0$ and again, we arrive at a contradiction.","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory']"
2460563,Can every finite product of cosines be rewritten as a finite sum of cosines?,"I used TrigReduce on products of cosines in Mathematica. It led to me to develop the formula $\prod_{i=1}^k\cos\left(\beta_i\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{2^{k-1}}\frac{\cos\left(P_j\right)}{2^{k-1}}, k \geq1$ where $P_j$ is a permutation of the signed sums of $\beta_i$'s, i.e.
$\beta_1+\beta_2+\beta_3+\beta_4+\beta_6$ and $\beta_1-\beta_2+\beta_3-\beta_4+\beta_6$ are two of the 32 permutations with $k=6 $ ($\beta_1$ always has a positive coefficient). How would I prove this? Is this formula out there in literature? I tried proving it by using the chain rule and then reverse because integration is linear over sums, and derivatives make sine functions more ""summy"". Then was going to use a recursive formula to prove by induction. But that line of reasoning doesn't explain how the $\beta$'s get in the same cosinusoidal term. Also, nothing in my undergrad used this and I couldn't find anything on google. And Mathematica doesn't give the general formula when I use k instead of a fixed number. ( I also get something similar with sinusoidal products).",['trigonometry']

My Solution : If $f(x)=\lambda e^{-\lambda x}$, the memorylessness of exponential random variables makes this problem equivalent to a symmetric random walk, then we can find the survival probability of a random walk and use the Brownian motion limit to prove this (see Survival Probability in here ).

I will not include every detail in the following proof, but the skeleton is there: Proof: WLOG we may assume $\theta = 0$ ; otherwise a rotation will do. $f$ now converges uniformly to $0$ on $0 < \text{arg} z < \varphi$ . Also, this means we can extend $f$ to $\partial \mathbb{D} \cap \text{sector}$ continuously by setting $f = 0$ on it. Now there must exist $N \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $N \varphi > 2\pi$ . Consider $f^N$ on $\mathbb{D}$ . We know that $f^N$ on $\partial \mathbb{D}$ is zero by the nature of $N$ and $\varphi$ .

2460977,The only closed subscheme of an affine scheme is the scheme itself?,"I was recently reading this excerpt from Mumford's Red Book. It concerns showing that every closed subscheme of an affine scheme $\text{Spec }R$ is determined by an ideal $R$. The individual steps themselves don't seem too hard, but once I realized what he was actually proving I became very confused. He defines the inclusion morphism $f: Y \longrightarrow \text{Spec }R$ where $Y$ is a closed subscheme of $\text{Spec }R$. He then proves, in the second paragraph of the excerpt I linked above, that $f$ is surjective. I originally thought this was a typo, but it seems to be the genuine conclusion of his argument. How is this possibly? How is the inclusion of a closed subscheme of an affine scheme surjective? That would mean that every closed subscheme of an affine scheme is homeomorphic to the whole affine scheme itself. That surely can't be the case, can it? It seems that either it is a mistake, or I have hugely misunderstood something. Knowing me, it's the latter.

2461245,What is wrong in this proof that any derivative function must be continuous? [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Where is the error in my proof that all derivatives are continuous? (1 answer) Closed 6 years ago . $f$ is differentiable on $(a, b)$. (1) Let $\alpha \in (a, b)$. $f'(\alpha) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(\alpha + h) - f(\alpha)}h$. (1) $\implies f$ is differentiable between $\alpha$ and $\alpha + h$, inclusive. By the mean value theorem, $\exists c_n$ between $\alpha$, $\alpha + h$: $f'(c_n) = \frac{f(\alpha + h) - f(\alpha)}{\alpha + h - \alpha}$. So, $f'(\alpha) = \lim_{h \to 0}f'(c_n)$. As $h \to 0$, $c_n \to \alpha$. So, $f'(\alpha) = \lim_{c_n \to \alpha}f'(c_h) \implies f'$ is continuous at $\alpha \forall\alpha\in(a, b)$. $\therefore f$ is differentiable on $(a, b) \implies f'$ is continuous on $(a, b)$.

2461253,A connected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree.,"I wrote this proof for simple graphs. Any feedback is appreciated. Theorem : A connected graph has an Euler circuit $\iff$ every vertex has even degree. Proof : $P \implies Q$, we want to show that if a connected graph $G$ has an Euler circuit, then all $v \in V(G)$ have even degree. An Euler circuit is a closed walk such that every edge in a connected graph $G$ is traversed exactly once. We define $w = v_0, v_1, v_2, ... v_k$, such that $v_0 = v_k$, to be that Euler circuit in $G$ of length $k$. We assume $|V(G)| > 0$. Case 1, $0 < i < k$: Since all edges in $w$ will be traversed, but no edge can be traversed more than once, we reach $v_i$ via one edge $\{v_{i-1}, v_i\}$ and have to leave via another untraversed edge $\{v_i, v_{i+1}\}$, so $deg(v_i) = 2n$, where $n$ is equal to the number of times $v_i$ appears in $w$, for $0 < i < k$. Case 2, $i \in {0, k}$: At the beginning of $w$, we traverse any edge incident to $v_0$, that is $\{v_0, v_1\}$. By definition of an Eulerian circuit, we also have to conclude the walk at the same vertex where we started, hence we reach $v_0 = v_k$ again via a different, $k$-th edge $\{v_{k-1}, v_k\}$. Every $n$ times we pass $v_0 = v_k$ before concluding the walk, Case 1 applies, hence $deg(v_0) = deg(v_k) = 2 + 2n$, which is even. $Q \implies P$, we want to show the other direction, that is if all $v \in V(G)$ have even degree, then a connected graph $G$ has an Euler circuit. Proposition $P(n)$: If $G$ is a connected graph with $n$ edges and all $v \in V(G)$ have even degree, then $G$ has an Euler circuit. We proceed by induction on $n$. Base case $P(0)$:  A connected graph without any edges has only one vertex $v$ with $deg(v) = 0$, therefore $P(0)$ is true. For purpose of induction, we assume $P(n)$ is true. Inductive step , $P(n + 1)$: Assume $G$ has $n+1$ edges. Since all $v \in V(G)$ have even degree, we know $G$ can't be a tree, so we can find a cycle $c = u_0, u_1, ..., u_i, ..., u_k$ of length $k$ in $G$. If $k = |E(G)|$, we found an Eulerian circuit that visits all edges exactly once and are done. Otherwise, remove all edges in $c$ from $G$. The resulting subgraph $G'$ might contain $s$ connected components $G'_j$ for $0 \leq j < s$. We know that all vertices in $c$ have even degree, so any vertex in $G'_{j}$ that was adjacent to a vertex in $c$ will have an even number of edges removed, therefore the parity of all $v \in G'$ remains even. the  Also, all $G'_j$ will have at most $n$ edges. Therefore we can assume $P(n)$ for all $G'_j$, that means we can find a Eulerian walk $w_j$ in each $G'_j$. Now reinsert the edges from $c$ into $G'$, reconstructing $G$. We walk all vertices in $c$, starting at any vertex $u \in c$. When we reach a vertex $u_i$ in $c$ for the first time and $u_i$ was part of a $G'_j$, we branch into $w_j$, follow that Eulerian walk $w_j$ until its end and continue to $u_{i+1}$. We do this for all $G'_j$ until we reach $u_k$. This will form an Eulerian walk that visits all edges in $G$ exactly once. I found the last part, where the cycle is re-inserted into the graph again quite hairy to describe properly, but leaving out superfluous details.","['graph-theory', 'proof-verification', 'discrete-mathematics']"

$$ u = 2-3x$$

$$ \frac{du}{dx} = -3 $$ Book Technique: 
$$dx = - \frac{du}{3}$$ $$ \int \frac{2-u}{3} u^{11} - \frac{du}{3}$$
$$ -\frac{1}{9} \int 2u^{11} - u^{12} du$$ My problem with this is that dy/dx is not a fraction but the limit of one  as  such the terms dy and dx on there own are in a sense meaningless and cannot be manipulated algebraically. For this reason, I solved it with a more formal technique: $$ \frac{dy}{du} = (\frac{2-u}{3})(u^{11}) = \frac{2u^{11}}{3} - \frac{u^{12}}{3} $$ Given, the reverse chain rule (i.e u-substitution) $$ u = g(x),  y = f(u) $$
$$ \int \frac{du}{dx} \frac{dy}{du} dx = \int \frac{dy}{du} du$$ so: $$ -\frac{1}{3} \int -3 x(2-3x)^{11} dx = \int \frac{dy}{dx} du   $$
$$ -\frac{1}{9}  \int 2u^{11} - u^{12} du $$ My question is thus: The technique used by the book is at most an approximation, i.e by assuming that $dy/dx$ is fraction we are taking an assumption that will not always hold, but in this case it seemingly does.

Here is my attempt at a proof: Let $f_k(z)=z^{\alpha_k} \exp(\beta_k z)$ for $k=1,\dots,N$ be distinct functions of $S$, for any branch of the powers,  and suppose that
$$\sum_{k=1}^N c_k f_k(z) \equiv 0. $$
Suppose w.l.o.g. that $\beta_1$ has the largest real part, then division gives
$$\sum_{k=1}^N c_k f_k(z) \exp(-\beta _1 z) \equiv 0, $$
and taking the limit as $z \to +\infty$ leaves us only with those powers $z^{\alpha_k}$, whose corresponding $\beta=\beta_1$. That is
$$\sum_{k=1}^n c_k z^{\alpha_k} \equiv 0, $$
where $f_k(z)=z^{\alpha_k} \exp(\beta_1 z)$ for $1 \leq k \leq n \leq N$. Using the linear independence of complex powers (which I won't prove here), we find $c_1=c_2=\dots=c_n=0$.

However, sometimes the task is to diagonalize a quadratic form, but not the way I just described, but by performing simultaneous column and row transformations (we can do that due to Sylvester's inertia theorem). Now my questions:
Are these procedures completely different from each other or are they doing the same thing? Why don't I use the spectral theorem to diagonalize a quadratic form or why don't I use the $2$nd procedure to diagonalize a general symmetric matrix?

2462338,"Continuous dependence on the RHS in ODEs, and related exercises","In Birkhoff and Rota's ""Ordinary Differential Equations"", p. 177, the following theorem is formulated (I've modified it slightly): Let $\mathbf{x}(t)$ and $\mathbf{y}(t)$ satisfy the DEs
  $$\mathrm{d} \mathbf{x}/ \mathrm{d}t= \mathbf{X}(\mathbf{x},t) \quad \text{ and } \quad \mathrm{d}\mathbf{y}/\mathrm{d} t= \mathbf{Y}(\mathbf{y},t) $$
  respectively, on $a \leq t \leq b$. Further, let the functions $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ be defined and continuous in a common domain $D \times [a,b]$, and let
  $$|\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{z},t)-\mathbf{Y}(\mathbf{z},t)|\leq \epsilon, \quad a\leq t \leq b, \quad \mathbf{z} \in D $$
  Finally let $\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{x},t)$ satisfy the Lipschitz condition
  $$|\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{x},t)-\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{y},t)| \leq L |\mathbf x-\mathbf y|, \quad \text{if} \quad (\mathbf{x},t),(\mathbf{y},t) \in D \times [a,b]. $$
  Then
  $$|\mathbf{x}(t)-\mathbf{y}(t)| \leq |\mathbf{x}(a)-\mathbf{y}(a)| \mathrm{e}^{L|t-a|}+ \frac{\epsilon}{L} \left[ \mathrm{e}^{L|t-a|}-1 \right].$$
  The function $\mathbf{Y}$ is not required to satisfy a Lipschitz condition. The proof of the above then makes use of a differential inequality, with the ""equals case"" being a Bernoulli differential equation. I'm upset at the fact that the authors haven't mentioned on what $t$-interval the result of the theorem holds. I suspect that the interval could be shorter than $[a,b]$, if the solutions leave the domain $D$. Later, in the exercises they ask to ""bound the difference on $[0,1]$ between solutions having the same initial value $y(0)=c$ for the DEs
$$y'=\mathrm{e}^y \; \text{and} \; y'=1+y+\cdots+\frac{y^n}{n!}. ""$$
When trying to solve this exercise, I've identified the first RHS, $\mathrm{e}^y$ with $\mathbf{X}$. The first equation can be solved explicitly as
$$y(x)=-\log(\mathrm{e}^{-c}-x), $$
with the interval of existence being $$(-\infty, \mathrm{e}^{-c}). $$
Hence, the exercise doesn't even make sense for $c \geq 0$. Even if I assume that $c<0$, I'm having difficulties finding a domain $D \ni y$, such that the solution will remain in it for $x \in [0,1]$ (which should be done without solving the equation, I suppose). Overall my questions are: In the statement of the theorem, what is the interval on which the conclusion holds? Can a claim of its size be made at all? How can one solve the aforementioned exercise?

Since, of course, first-year (standard) calculus doesn't provide, as far as I know, tools to solve this, after trying in vain on my own I looked for solutions on the web, and I found the following procedure in a physics forum: $$ \frac{dv}{dt} = -3v^2 \ \implies \ \frac{dv}{v^2}=-3dt \\ \implies \int_{v_0}^v\frac{dv}{v^2}=\int_0^t(-3dt) \implies \frac{1}{v_0}-\frac{1}{v}=-3t \ .$$
The numerical result stemming from this procedure is in perfect agreement with the numerical value given by the textbook itself (the textbook gives $0.2222$, my calculator gives $0. \bar 2 $). There are quite a lot of things that I don't understand here. There's the infamous multiplication by $dt$ and consequent cancellation of it in the LHS. What assumptions need to be made to justify this, if it is even possible? Apart from that, in the same passage they also divide by $v^2$. Is this only justified in this case because they know that both the initial and final velocity are greater than zero and the velocity is strictly decreasing? If not, how? In the next passage, they integrate the LHS as if $v$ was a variable, and I'm not sure if or how the variable substitution theorem and/or the chain rule can apply in this specific context, since we're coming from an expression (between the first and second passage) that either doesn't make sense or presents differential forms, which I haven't studied yet. In general , is there a theorem that somehow justifies this notational manipulations?, And in what conditions would such a theorem apply?","['physics', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
2462852,Proving that $f(x)=x^3+x+2$ is bijective without calculus,"I want to prove that $f(x)=x^3+x+2$, $f: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is bijective without calculus. My attempts at showing to prove that it' injective and surjective are written below: $1)$ Injectivity: I want to show that $\forall a,b \in \mathbb R$ $f(a)=f(b) \implies a=b$. I started like this:
$$f(a)=f(b) \implies a^3+a+2=b^3+b+2$$ 
$$\implies a(a^2+1)=b(b^2+1)$$
$$\implies \frac{a}{b}=\frac{b^2+1}{a^2+1}$$
Then I said since $\frac{b^2+1}{a^2+1}>0$ $\forall a,b \in \mathbb R$ then either $a \land b < 0$ or $a \land b > 0$. (For the case when $b=0 \land a \in \mathbb R$ it would be easy to prove that $a=b$.) From there it seemed pretty obvious that $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{b^2+1}{a^2+1} \implies a=b$ so I couldn't really draw a logical argument to show that $a=b$. $2)$ Surjectivity: I want to show that $\forall b \in \mathbb R$ $\exists a \in \mathbb R$ s.t. $f(a)=b$. I started like this: Let $b \in \mathbb R$ and set $f(a)=b$ then we have: $$a^3+a+2=b$$
$$\implies a^3+a=b-2$$
$$\implies a(a^2+1)=b-2$$ But then I couldn't find an expression for $a \in \mathbb R$ in terms of $b$. 
So I'm wondering if anyone can tell me how I can proceed with my surjectivity and injectivity proofs.","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis', 'proof-writing', 'functions']"

Let $X$ be a Normal distributed stochastic value with $\mu=4$ and $\sigma = 7$ Find a value $C$ so that $P(X>C)=0.78$ The way I've solved this question was to first change the equation like so $$1-P(X<C)=0.78$$
$$P(X<C)=0.22$$ Then find the $Z$ value that equals $0.22$ and that would be $Z(-0.77)$ That makes my new equation equal to. $$P(X<C)=Z(-0.77)$$
I then use the formula for the normal distrubtion and solve for a C that would make the equation equal to $-0.77$ $$\frac{C-4}{7}=-0.77$$

First was to show that if such family is uncountable, then it is not true that all proper beginning segment (is it correct english name for that?) is of the form $O(x)=\{y:y<x\}$ for some $x$. Another idea was to assume that $(A,\subseteq)$ is such well-order. There are $a,b\in A, a\subset b$, such that between $a$ and $b$ there are uncountably many elements. Let's take subset $B$ which contains $a,b$ and all elements between them. Let's define sequence $z_n$, where $z_0=b$ and $z_{n+1}$ is element of set $\{x\in B:x<z_n$ and there are uncountably many elements between $a$ and $x\}$. By axiom of choice such sequence exists.

2463047,not understanding identity theorem for polynomials,"Suppose $f(x)$ is a polynomial such that $f(x) = a_nx^n +
 a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_{n-2}x^{n-2} + \cdots +a_1 x + a_0$ and there are
at least $n+1$ different values of $x$ for which $f(x) =0$ . (a) If $a_n\neq 0$ , then what does the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
tell us about the number of different values of $x$ for which $f(x) =
 0$ ? (b) Why must we have $f(x) = 0$ for all values of $x$ ? It is with the answer to question (b) that I have the most difficulty. The answer to (a) and (b) is: If any of the $a_i$ are nonzero, then $\deg f \le n$ . Therefore, by
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, if any of the $a_i$ are nonzero,
then $f(x)$ cannot have more than $n$ roots. However, we are told that
there are at least $n+1$ values of $x$ for which $f(x) = 0$ . So, it is
impossible for any of the $a_i$ to be nonzero (since then the
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra would force $f(x)$ to have no more than $n$ roots). Therefore, all the $a_i$ must be 0, which means $f(x) = 0$ for all values of $x$ . â–¡ I'm having difficulty understanding what is meant with any of the $a_i$ are nonzero . What does this mean? That none of them are 0? As far as I'm understanding, $f(x) = 0$ , like, literally. Then, there is the following, related bit: Suppose that $f(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial such that $f(2) = 4$ , $f(3) = 9$ , and $f(4) = 16$ . Prove that $f(x)=x^2$ . By inspection, we note that $f(x) = x^2$ satisfies $f(2) = 4$ , $f(3) =
 9$ , and $f(4) = 16$ . However, maybe there are other quadratics $f(x)$ such that $f(2) = 4$ , $f(3) = 9$ , and $f(4) = 16$ . How can we tell if $f(x)= x^2$ is the only possible one? We let $g(x) = f(x) - x^2$ and focus on $g(x)$ , because we know that
2, 3, and 4 are all roots of $g(x)$ . Therefore, the Factor Theorem
tells us that $x-2$ , $x-3$ , and $x-4$ are all factors of $g(x)$ . So,
we have $$ g(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)q(x), $$ for some polynomial $q(x)$ . This tells us that either the degree of $g(x)$ is at least 3,
or $q(x)=g(x)= 0$ for all values of $x$ . However, because $g(x) = f(x)
 -x^2$ and $f(x)$ is a quadratic, we know that the degree of $g(x)$ cannot be larger than 2. Therefore, we must have $q(x) = g(x)= 0$ for
all $x$ . Finally, since $f(x) = g(x) + x^2$ , we know that $f(x) = x^2$ for all $x$ . But why is $g(x) = f(x) - x^2$ ? I mean, I know why , but why not any other polynomial? In other words, I'm not convinced; I'm still thinking that there might be some polynomial out there which satisfies the conditions. For example: $f(1) = 1$ , $f(2) = 8$ , $f(3) = 27$ , and $f(4) = 64$ . This looks like it might be $x^3$ , but actually, it is $f(x) = x^3 + (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) \left( 16,\!000,\!000x^{427} 473.15x^{101} - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}} x^{23} + x^5 + 99 \right)$ I could have gone and done: $g(x) = f(x) - x^3$ with $f(x) = x^3$ . Then, $g(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)q(x)$ . Since the degree of $g(x)$ cannot be larger than 3, we must have that $q(x) = g(x) = 0$ . Finally, we have $f(x) = g(x) + x^3$ , and we know that $g(x) = 0$ , and so $f(x) = x^3$ . But apparently it doesn't proof anything because there's a polynomial out there that produces the same result! So what did I proof?","['algebra-precalculus', 'polynomials']"
2463070,Why are functions with vanishing normal derivative dense in smooth functions?,"Question Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with piecewise smooth boundary. Why are smooth functions with vanishing normal derivative dense in $C^\infty(M)$ in the $H^1$ norm? Here I define $C^\infty(M)$ to be those functions which have all orders of derivative continuous on $M$ and smooth in its interior. For example, $(x\mapsto \sin(\pi x))\in C^\infty([0,1])$ but $(x\mapsto \sqrt{x})\notin C^\infty([0,1])$. I have crossposted this to MathOverflow . Background This is inspired by my belief that the form domain of the Friedrichs extension of the Neumann Laplacian on $M$ is equal to $H^1(M)$. If my belief is wrong, I would certainly accept as answer a counterexample, preferably with some discussion/references. Here are the approaches I'm exploring. Given $u\in C^\infty(M)$ construct a function that agrees away from an $\epsilon$ neighborhood of $\partial M$, but has been modified to have zero normal derivative. This is described below, but runs into some trouble at corners and with smoothing. Given $u\in C^\infty(M)$, find some $\eta$ supported on an $\epsilon$ neighborhood of $\partial M$ such that $\nabla\eta|_{\partial M}$ is equal to the projection of $\nabla u|_{\partial M}$ onto the normal direction and $\eta$ and $|\nabla\eta|$ uniformly bounded in $\epsilon$. Then $u - \eta$ will be the desired approximation and uniform boundedness will imply $\|u - (u-\eta)\|_{H^1}\to 0$. I'm not sure if this is a search for an integrable harmonic vector field or if it's a constrained optimization problem. Simply show that any $u\in C^\infty(M)$ that is perpendicular to all smooth functions with vanishing normal derivative must be zero. In order to do this, I think it still runs into the same fundamental difficulty as the others, which is constructing functions with vanishing normal derivative supported on an $\epsilon$-neighborhood of the boundary. (I'm also happy to simply have a reference to follow up. A reference for domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$ should be fine, too, and just a partition of unity away from a Riemannian manifold.) Current Approach The approach I'm considering right now is an elaboration on possibility (2) from my list. The sketch is: set the boundary condition that $\nabla\eta$ on the boundary be equal to the normal component of $\nabla u$ and find an integrable harmonic vector field $E$ satisfying that boundary condition. Then cut off $E$ so it is only supported in a neighborhood of $\partial M$, and let $\eta$ be so that $E = \nabla\eta$. Intuition is that the maximum principle will control $|E|$ and $|\eta|$, so that $\eta$ will be bounded above in the $H^1$ norm by a constant times the volume of the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $\partial M$. Another approach is inspired by zhw's comment below: approximate $\nabla u$ among $L^2$ vector fields, multiply it by a cutoff function so it is supported in the interior of $M$, and then integrate it to approximate $u$. This should work with some tweaking in $[0,1]$ but I'm not sure how well it will work in general. Older work My approach has been as follows. The intuition is to take an arbitrary smooth function, restrict it to the complement of a collar neighborhood, then extend the restriction to the collar neighborhood so that the value is constant on inward-normal geodesics. However I'm running into issues at corners. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be such that $\{p\in M\ |\ d(p,\partial M) < \epsilon\}$ is a collar neighborhood of $\partial M$. Let $e_\epsilon(p)$ for $p\in\partial M$ be the smaller of $\epsilon$ or the greatest time parameter such that the inward normal geodesic collides with no other inward normal geodesic. Let $N$ be the set of inward normal vectors on $\partial M$ whose lengths are no greater than $e_\epsilon$. The interior of the set $\operatorname{exp}(N)$ is foliated by geodesics. Edit- Note this is not necessarily true if the manifold has inward corners. Given a smooth, continuous function $u$ on $M$, define $\bar{u}$ to be the restriction of $u$ in the complement of $\operatorname{exp}(N)$ and on each geodesic leaf of the interior of $\operatorname{exp}(N)$ define $\bar{u}$ to take the value that $u$ takes on the inward limit of that leaf. Here's trouble. As $\bar{u}$ need not be smooth, I'd like to mollify it. Edit- I had a detail incorrect. A standard mollifier produces a function defined on compact subsets of the interior of $M$. So the mollifier has to be modified. One idea I'm following up on is varying the support of the mollifying function based on distance to $\partial M$. I'm skeptical, as varying the mollifying function will add another component to the gradient, but if it works I'll post as an answer.","['riemannian-geometry', 'reference-request', 'functional-analysis', 'sobolev-spaces', 'manifolds-with-boundary']"
