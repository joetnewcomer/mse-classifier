7589,A plane algebraic curve with all four kinds of double points,"During my study of plane algebraic curves, I got curious if there is a nontrivial example of a plane algebraic curve that has a node , a cusp (for my purposes I do not care which of the two kinds of cusps would the example exhibit), a tacnode , and an isolated point . By ""nontrivial"" I mean a curve that was not constructed as a chimera of two or more simpler curves, e.g. $(x-y)(x^2+y^2-1)=0$. Of course, it would be a quintic at the very least (i.e. the algebraic degree should be 5 at the minimum). Apart from an explicit example, I would also be interested in a general procedure for constructing algebraic curves with a prescribed number and type of singular points. After trying out Qiaochu's and T..'s suggestions, I have a follow-up question: does the problem become more difficult if the requirement that the curve be bounded (i.e. one can draw a circle such that the whole curve, including the isolated point, is within the circle) is imposed?","['plane-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"
7593,Decomposing the plane into intervals,"A recent Missouri State problem stated that it is easy to decompose the plane into half-open intervals and asked us to do so with intervals pointing in every direction.  That got me trying to decompose the plane into closed or open intervals.  The best I could do was to make a square with two sides missing (which you can do out of either type) and form a checkerboard with the white squares missing the top and bottom and the black squares missing the left and right.  That gets the whole plane except the lattice points.  This seems like it must be a standard problem, but I couldn't find it on the web.  So can the plane be decomposed into unit open intervals?  closed intervals?","['geometry', 'tiling', 'euclidean-geometry']"
7594,How can I get this tricky sum of a Hadamard product of generating functions?,"I am interested in the sum of a Hadamard product of generating functions. If we are given $n$ functions, where $0 < i \leq n$, of the form: $$f_i(x_i) = \sum_{j=0}^m{c_{i,j} x_i^j}.$$ The hadamard product is defined as: $$g(x) = \sum_{j=0}^m{( \prod_{i=0}^n {c_{i,j}})x^j}.$$ It's essentially the same as going through all the generating functions simultaneously and multiplying all the $j$th coefficients together to obtain a new coefficient. Some given information I have polynomials; I think of them as finite length generating functions.  I know that all of the coefficients are natural numbers.  I'd like the sum of the resulting coefficients. There's a trick.  Calculating the Hadamard product generates an extremely complicated expression.  I would like to avoid dealing with this expression explicitly, if possible. I want to know ways that I could do this.","['sequences-and-series', 'functions', 'analysis']"

7618,Expressions unchanged by permuting the roots of a polynomial,"I am trying to self-read through Ian Stewart's Galois theory and am stuck at this paragraph. I quote - ""Lagrange observed that all methods for solving polynomial equations by radicals involve constructing rational functions of the roots that take a small number of values when the roots $\alpha_j$ are permuted. Prominent among these is the expression $$\delta = \prod_{j< k} (\alpha_j - \alpha_k)$$ which takes just two values, $\pm \delta$, plus for even permutations and minus for the odd ones. Therefore, $\Delta = \delta^{2}$ is a rational function of the coefficients. This gets us started and it yields a complete solution for the quadratic."" My question is as follows: Why should an expression that is unchanged by permuting the roots of a polynomial be expressible as a rational function of the polynomial's coefficients? Is this statement even true or have I misunderstood the book?","['group-theory', 'polynomials']"
7619,Dealing with grouping problem in combinatorics,"I am trying to solve some problems based on this formula ,but am facing some issues in determine whether or not consider ordering as important. For Example: In how many ways 15 different books can be divided five heaps of equal number of books ? So here according to the answer the ordering of groups is not considered important,hence the answer given is $\frac {15!} {5!(3!)^5}$ and the same thing goes for this one : In how many ways 3 piles can be formed out of 18 different books , which will be $\frac {18!} {3!(6!)^3}$ But for the following problem ""There are three copies, each of four different books. In how many ways they can be arranged on a self ?"" This this is similar to divide 12 books into 4 sets of 3 books each, the answer given here considers the ordering important,why this change ? Why in the first two the ordering not and on the third one it is important ? I guess (if the solution is correct) it is something related to copies but am not confident enough. A good example of a problem where ordering should be considered important is say "" In how many ways can 18 different books be divided equally among three students ?"" The solution should be $\frac {18!} {(6!)^3}$ But I am not much confident while in these problems so I will be grateful if somebody helps me to understand when to consider ordering important and when not to.",['combinatorics']
7621,Accuracy of approximation to inclusion-exclusion formula in prime sieve,"This thing came up in a combinatorics course I am taking. Choose a fixed set of primes $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k$ and let $A_n$ be number of integers in $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ which are not divisible by any of the $p_i$'s. $A_n$ is given by $ n - \sum_{1\leq i_1 \leq k} \lfloor \frac{n}{p_{i_1}} \rfloor + \sum_{1\leq i_1 < i_2 < k} \lfloor \frac{n}{p_{i_1}p_{i_2}}\rfloor - \dots $. Now, if $n$ is divisible by each of the $p_i$'s then we have the simpler expression : $A_n = n \prod_{i=1}^{k}(1-\frac{1}{p_i})$(added later : note I am not assuming $n = \prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i$ here, this holds true whenever $n = c \prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i $ for some integer c, since each $\lfloor \frac{n}{p_{i_1} \dots p_{i_j}} \rfloor = \frac{n}{p_{i_1} \dots p_{i_j}}\ )$. Another student pointed out that even if $n$ does not have $\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i$ as a factor, the approximation $B_n = n \prod_{i=1}^{k}(1-\frac{1}{p_i})$ to $A_n$ is quite close in some specific cases. It is easy to see that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{A_n - B_n}{n}=0$ as $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\lfloor \frac{n}{p_{i_1}p_{i_2}\dots p_{i_j}} \rfloor \to \frac{1}{p_{i_1}p_{i_2} \dots p_{i_j}},$ however that is not strong enough to imply that $A_n - B_n$ will be always close.
Is there any way to analyze how well this approximation will perform in general? I am interested in the worst case for small to moderately sized $n$. Just to give a feel of how close $A_n$ and $B_n$ can get, assuming the set of primes is $\{2,3,7\}$ we have (assuming my program is correct): n     A(n)     B(n)

I am willing to ""settle"" for a triangle that is off by the width of a pencil lead. (That is, if we draw circles of radius $\delta$ around all of the lattice points, the true location of the vertices of the equilateral triangle are inside of these error circles.)

7628,Bott periodicity and algebraic geometry,"It is a theorem that every locally free coherent sheaf on $\mathbb{P}^1$ over an algebraically closed field is isomorphic to a unique sum of sheaves $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for various integers $n$. In particular, the K-ring of locally free coherent sheaves (or all coherent sheaves, $\mathbb{P}^1$ being nonsingular) is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}]$. The topological K-ring of vector bundles on $S^2$ is, by Bott periodicity, isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}[H]/(H-1)^2$, where $H$ is the canonical bundle. But $S^2$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$. Every locally free sheaf corresponds to a vector bundle on $S^2$. It follows that the map on the K-groups from locally free sheaves to vector bundles is surjective but not injective. Questions: What goes wrong? Is there a version of Bott periodicity for algebraic varieties (or schemes)? (I.e., relating K-groups of $X$ and $X \times \mathbb{P}^1$.) I understand that there is one for the Picard groups.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"

What happens? B. You get a new bb-gun and the bullets have a little width to them. ($\delta$?) You fire the gun in an arbitrary direction without bothering to aim. What happens? C. All of the trees are removed that have coordinates whose absolute values are not perfect squares. (So, only points such as $(25, 100)$ and $(4,-1600)$ remain.)  Again you use width-less bullets.

7659,Why is $(x^2-2)/(2y^2+3)$ never an integer for any integers $x$ and $y$?,"I've started a little reading on quadratic reciprocity, and a reason for this has eluded me. Here's a little of what I came up with so far. I decided I want to show that for all primes $p$, if $p|x^2-2$, then $p$ does not divide $2y^2+3$. Then, by way of contradiction, if $(x^2-2)/(2y^2+3)$ is an integer, then any $p$ such that $p|2y^2+3$ would have to divide $x^2-2$, a contradiction. I see this is true for $p=2$. I want to find all $p$ such that $x^2\equiv 2\pmod{p}$, and since for any odd $p$, $$\left(\frac{2}{p}\right)=(-1)^{(p^2-1)/8}$$ I see $(2|p)=1$ iff $p\equiv 1,7\pmod{8}$. So only primes of the form $8k+1$ or $8k+7$ divide $x^2-2$. However, I don't see a way to show that primes of the form $8k+1$ or $8k+7$ do not divide $2y^2+3$, so maybe I'm completely off the mark.

7676,Solving congruences in two variables,"Is there a specific way to attack congruences with two variables? The reason I ask is because up until now, I had never encountered such a problem. While browsing tonight, I came across this challenge problem in one of my books: Suppose that $(ab,p)=1$ and that $p>2$. Show that the number of solutions $(x,y)$ of the congruence $ax^2+by^2\equiv 1\pmod{p}$ is $p-\left(\frac{-ab}{p}\right)$. After experimenting with it for a few hours, I've barely gotten anywhere. So far, I've only managed to break it into some cases. $(ab,p)=1$ implies $(a,p)=(b,p)=1$ and $\left(\frac{-ab}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{-1}{p}\right)\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)\left(\frac{b}{p}\right)$, so if
$\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{b}{p}\right)=1$ or $-1$, then $\left(\frac{ab}{p}\right)=1$, so I want to show there are $p-(-1)^{(p-1)/2}$ solutions. Similarly, if $\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)=1$ and $\left(\frac{b}{p}\right)=-1$, I need to show there are $p+(-1)^{(p-1)/2}$ solutions. In the first case, $a$ and $b$ would both be quadratic residues modulo $p$, and hence $c^2\equiv a\pmod{p}$ and $d^2\equiv b\pmod{p}$ for some $c,d$. Then the original problem would come to $(cx)^2+(dy)^2\equiv 1\pmod{p}$, but I'm not sure a sum of squares is any better.

7774,Upper-triangular matrix is invertible iff its diagonal is invertible: C*-algebra case,"Exercise 1.14 of the book Rordam, Larsen and Laustsen ""An introduction to K-theory for C*-algebras"" asks to prove that an upper triangular matrix with elements from some C*-algebra $A$ is invertible in $M_n(A)$ iff all diagonal entries are invertible in $A$ . Trying to solve this I've found that if $a$ is invertible and $\delta$ is such that $(a^{-1}\delta)^n=0$ then $a+\delta$ is invertible too and its inverse is given by $(a+\delta)^{-1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-a^{-1}\delta)^ka^{-1}$ . Using this fact I can show that if diagonal is invertible, then upper-triangular matrix with this diagonal is invertible too, and also that if upper-triangular matrix has upper-triangular inverse, then its diagonal is invertible. So all I need to prove is that if upper-triangular matrix invertible, then its inverse is upper-triangular. I've failed to prove this. Also there is a hint for this exercise: ""Solve the equation $ab=1$ where $a$ is as above [i.e. upper-triangular matrix] and where $b$ is unknown upper triangular matrix"". Solution of this equation follows from my reasoning above, but this doesn't help. Update (counterexample attempt): I've made one more attempt and it looks for me like I have found a counterexample. However I think there is a mistake in it (because otherwise there is a mistake in the book ). Here it is.

From these we have that $$\begin{pmatrix}z&tz^* \\\ 0&t^* \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}z^* &0\\\ zt^* &t\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\ 0&1\end{pmatrix}$$ and $$\begin{pmatrix}z^* &0\\\ zt^* &t\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}z&tz^* \\\ 0&t^* \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\ 0&1\end{pmatrix}.$$ So now my question should say ""Where am I wrong?"".","['c-star-algebras', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

7783,Proving a known zero of the Riemann Zeta has real part exactly 1/2,"Much effort has been expended on a famous unsolved problem about the Riemann Zeta function $\zeta(s)$ .  Not surprisingly, it's called the Riemann hypothesis, which asserts: $$ \zeta(s) = 0 \Rightarrow \operatorname{Re} s = \frac1 2 \text{ or } \operatorname{Im} s = 0 .$$ Now there are numerical methods for approximating $\zeta(s)$, but as I understand, no one knows any exact values except at even integers, which include the trivial zeroes for which $\operatorname{Im} s = 0 $.  So I've always wondered: For the rest, how does one prove $\operatorname{Re} s = 1/2$ exactly ?

Since the invert transformation is $$u=\arccos \sqrt{\dfrac{1-x^{2}}{1-x^{2}y^{2}}}$$ $$v=\arccos \sqrt{\dfrac{1-y^{2}}{1-x^{2}y^{2}}}$$ it is easy to see that three of the vertices (although not belonging to the domain) are transformed as follows: $$(x,y)=(0,0)\mapsto (0,0)=(u,v),$$ $$(x,y)=(1,0)\mapsto (\pi /2,0)=(u,v),$$ $$(x,y)=(0,1)\mapsto (0,\pi /2)=(u,v).$$ Question 1 - But how is the fourth vertex $(x,y)=(1,1)$ transformed?

7860,How does $norm(A) \leq p(A) + e$ imply $norm(A) < 1$ if $p(A) < 1$?,"I am given a lemma and it states: Lemma: Let $A$ be a real $n\times n$ matrix.  Then given any $e > 0$, there is a $norm$ such that $norm(A) \leq p(A) + e$,  where $p(A)$ is the spectral radius of $A$. They then go on to state that based on this lemma, if $p(A) < 1$, then $norm(A) < 1$ for the correct choice of the norm. What I'm looking for help on is understanding how they came to that conclusion based only on that lemma.  For example, given $e =0.001$, then the lemma states there is a norm such that $norm(A)\leq p(A) + .001$. Since it is a ""or equal"" then this means there is the possibility that $norm(A) = p(A) + 0.001$, and in such a case then $norm(A) > p(A)$.  So it seems that based on the lemma, then $p(A) < 1$ does not necessarily always imply that $norm(A) < 1$. I even tried to do a proof of this but still came up with the same result: $$\begin{align}
p(A)<1&\implies p(A)+e<1+e\\
&\implies norm(A)\leq p(A)+e<1+e\\
&\implies norm(A)-e\leq p(A)<1.
\end{align}
$$ This pretty much says the same thing, if $norm(A) - e \leq p(A)$, then $p(A) < 1$, but if $p(A)$ close to $1$ by a difference less than $e$, then $norm(A) > 1$ in the ""equal to"" case where $norm(A) - e = p(A)$. Now of course you could pick a smaller e, but the way the lemma reads it says that for a given $e$, you can find a norm s.t. $norm(A) \leq p(A) + e$, so the ""or equal"" part will still get you using a counter example I gave similar to the $e = .001$ above Now I have seen a different proof on wikipedia that shows if $p(A) < 1$ then $norm(A) < 1$, so I am not disputing that fact, but that proof gets into looking at entries of the Jordan Normal Form.  So my point is, yes $p(A) < 1$ then $norm(A) < 1$, BUT I don't understand how you can conclude that based only on the Lemma I gave at the beginning.

7862,More Cantor-like constructions,"Two questions: (1.) Construct a subset of $[0,1]$ in the same manner as the Cantor set, except that at the $k$-th stage, each interval removed has length $\delta 3^{-k}$, $0<\delta <1$. Show that the resulting set is perfect, has measure $1-\delta$, and contains no intervals. Showing that it's perfect is not difficult. The resulting set is an intersection of closed intervals, so is closed. Any point in the set is a limit point of endpoints of intervals (obviously I have more details in my written solution, but that's the idea.) But I don't see how the measure is $1-\delta$... At stage $k$, we remove $2^{k-1}$ intervals of length $\delta 3^{-k}$, so the measure of the resulting set is $$1-\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}{2^{k}\cdot\dfrac{\delta}{3^{k+1}}} = 1-\dfrac{\delta}{3}\cdot\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}{\dfrac{2^k}{3^k}} = 1-\dfrac{2\delta}{3} .$$ Thoughts? (2.) Construct a Cantor-type set subset of $[0,1]$ by removing from each interval remaining at the $k$-th stage a subinterval of relative length $\theta_k$, $0<\theta_k<1$. Show that the remainder has measure zero if and only if $\sum{\theta_k}=\infty$. (Use the fact that for $a_k>0$, $\prod\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}{a_k}$ converges, in the sense that $\lim\limits_{N\to\infty}{\prod\limits_{k=1}^N{a_k}}$ exists and is not zero, if only if $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}{\log{a_k}}$ converges. ) I don't really understand the construction. Suppose we have our $\theta_1$ and we remove an interval of that length. So then we choose $\theta_2$ so that $\theta_2 < \dfrac{1-\theta_1}{2}$, or something like that? Or... ?

7865,Combinatorics and Rolling Dice Similarity?,"Define a function $F(A, B, C)$ as the number of ways you can roll $B$ $C$-sided dice to sum up to $A$, counting different orderings (rolling a $2$, $2$, and $3$ with three dice is different from rolling a $2$, $3$, and $2$). Example: With three $5$-sided dice, the list of $F(A, B, C)$ values in the domain of the possible values of $A$ for $B = 3$ and $C = 5$ is: $$F(3, 3, 5), F(4, 3, 5), F(5, 3, 5), F(6, 3, 5), ... , F(15, 3, 5)$$ is evaluated to:
$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 18, 19, 18, 15, 10, 6, 3, 1$$
Call this list $L_1$. Let $s$ be the number of sides on each die, let $n$ be the number of dice, and let $v$ be the total value to roll from the $n$ dice.
Let $L_2$ be the list of ${v - 1}\choose{v - n}$ in the domain of $v$ values for $n = 3$.
Then $L_2$ is:
$${{3 - 1}\choose{3 - 3}}, {{4 - 1}\choose{4 - 3}}, {{5 - 1}\choose{5 - 3}}, {{6 - 1}\choose{6 - 3}}, ... , {{15 - 1}\choose{15 - 3}}$$

$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15$$

  $$\begin{align}

  $$\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\alpha(s)\beta(t)\alpha^{-1}(s)\beta^{-1}(t)\right|_{(s=0,t=0)}=2[A,B].$$ When I tried to derive this for myself, using the fact that
$$\left.\frac{\partial\alpha^{-1}}{\partial s}\right|_{s=0} = \left.-\alpha^{-1}\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial s}\alpha^{-1}\right|_{s=0} = -A,$$

Now I take a second ring (mod $m$, for instance) and calculate the points of a function for all elements of this ring.

7986,Integration by Parts implies U-substitution?,"So I feel a bit strange asking a Calculus question, but this came up today while teaching. One can check that if you start with some integral, which can be see as an ""obvious u-substitution problem"", that you can instead use integration by parts, and wind up with the scenario where you have have the original integral on both sides of your equation so you solve for the integral. Example: Given $I=\int g^n(x)g'(x)dx$ we can clearly use u-substitution, but if we use integration by parts we get the equation $I=-nI+g^{n+1}$. This is nothing exciting or surprising, but it yields the observation that u-sub leads to one of these int by parts equations. Question Is the opposite true? What I mean to say is, if you do integration by parts and you wind up with an equation of this type, does it mean that you could of used some very clever u-substitution? I feel like I should know this, but I have thought about it today, and asked a friend or two, and we don't see an immediate proof of this. Thanks!",['calculus']

8004,Verifying a Closure Operation,"I'm just starting to learn some basic topology, and I've mostly encountered definitions. For instance, I read that for a topological space $X$, for any $E\subseteq X$, define its closure $\overline{E}$ as the set of points $p\in X$ such that each neighborhood $N$ of $p$ has a nonempty intersection with $E$. I wanted to verify that this is indeed a closure operation, and here's what I have: (1) Suppose $p\in E$, then for any $N$, $p\in N$, so $N\cap E\neq\emptyset$, so $p\in\overline{E}$, and thus $E\subseteq\overline{E}$. (2) Suppose $p\in\overline{E\cup F}$. Then for any $N$, $N\cap(E\cup F)\neq\emptyset$, so $(N\cap E)\cup(N\cap F)\neq\emptyset$, and thus either $N\cap E\neq\emptyset$ or $N\cap F\neq\emptyset$, so $p\in\overline{E}$ or $p\in\overline{F}$, and thus $\overline{E\cup F}\subseteq\overline{E}\cup\overline{F}$. (3) For any $p\in X$, the intersection of any $N$ and $\emptyset$ is empty, so there are no points such that every neighborhood has nonempty intersection with $\emptyset$. Hence $\overline{\emptyset}=\emptyset$. (4) I'm stuck showing that $\overline{\overline{E}}=\overline{E}$ . From (1), I know that $\overline{E}\subseteq\overline{\overline{E}}$, but I can't show the other containment. I took $p\in\overline{\overline{E}}$, and so every $N\cap\overline{E}\neq\emptyset$. I want to show $p\in N\cap\overline{E}$, and I think this would be easy if $X$ contains isolated points. But then I found out there are such things as perfect sets or dense-in-itself sets, so that can't work. Is there some trick to show this containment?

8025,How safe is it to ignore low probability events?,"See this question on applying probability theory principles in software design. The question is generally the following: you design some system (say software) and rely on some well-known mathematical concept (say hash function). You know that when this concept is used without caution your system can sometimes fail, however the probability of such failure is extremely low. You need to evaluate whether you want to alter the design or can just ignore that drawback. Consequences of a failure are usually taken into account when such evaluations are done. For example if a failure leads to a person being mildly offended then it is not that of a problem but if a failure leads to a nuclear power explosion that it is a serious problem. Now the accepted answer goes like this (all numbers here are exaggerated for better perception): probability of Earth colliding with a space rock is 10E-50 and probability of that drawback causing a problem is 10E-100. You see - Earth colliding with a space rock is a gazillion times more likely. So relax, that design is good enough. Is that reasoning correct?

Presume that I know that for each C dollars I spend on research and development there's a D% chance of finding a breakthrough. Of course, spending money on research and development means that I have less to spend on building widgets. I have a monthly budget of E dollars. This budget is not directly tied to my profit margin, but it is safe to say that it my profit margins influence future budgets (i.e., if I make no widgets for three straight months b/c I do all research and development, it's likely that my budget will be reduced, whereas if I discover a breakthrough the first month my profits will skyrocket and I'll likely see that budget grow over time). In case that is too abstract, here's the real world scenario I'm interested in solving (although I'd like a more general approach, as well): A = 15 dollars B = 3 C = 5 dollars D = 2.75% E = 30 dollars That is, today widgets cost me 15 dollars to build but if I can find a breakthrough I know I can make them at 1/3 the cost (5 dollars).
