1875878,Proving that $x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$ is not irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for any prime $p$.,"So I have seen the similar question and answers on here for $x^4 +1$, but I am having trouble extending anything there to this polynomial... I understand it is fairly trivial with Galois theory, but my class has just barely covered Field Extensions, so suffice it to say we have no Galois theory to play with. I managed to prove it for the primes such that $p \equiv 1, 7 \pmod 8$, by noting that $2$ is a square modulo those primes and thus $x^4 - 2x^2 +1 = (x^2 -1 + 2qx)(x^2 - 1 - 2qx)$ for those $\mathbb{Z}_p$... however, trying to get a similar result for $3 \pmod 8$ and $5 \pmod 8$ has been stumping me for a long time, I am having a hard time making $q^2 = -1$ and $q^2 = -2$ give me something factorable... I guess the worst part of all of this is that I don't think this solution is even particularly enlightening, in terms of abstract algebra. It's really just some number theory trickery. I don't think my course has prepared me theoretically for this problem, does anyone have an elementary approach to it?","['irreducible-polynomials', 'abstract-algebra']"

1876007,Motivation for the scaling in Tracy Widom distribution,"For past few months, I am self studying random matrices from the book  - An Introduction to Random Matrices by Anderson et.al. I was going through the result concerning the eigenvalues of the GUE at the edge of the spectrum (Theorem 3.1.4) I am trying to understand how the non intuitive scale factor N^(2/3) comes up. The proof of Lemma 3.7.2 seems to play the key role in the proof of the above theorem. Define $\displaystyle \psi_n(x)=\frac{e^{-x^2/4}H_n(x)}{\sqrt{\sqrt{2\pi}n!}}$ where $H_n(x)$ is the n-th Hermite polynomial and let $\displaystyle \Psi_n(x)=n^{1/12}\psi_n(2\sqrt{n}+\frac{x}{n^{1/6}})$. For this $\Psi_n(x)$ we have I went through the proof of lemma 3.7.2 which uses steepest descent. Why that scaling factor is used is hidden in that proof. The following are first few steps of the proof. Focus on the last paragraph of the above image. A taylor expansion of $F(s) = log(1+s) + s^2/2 - s$ starts with
  $s^3/3$ in a neighbourhood of $0$, explains the particular scaling for
  u. This line, present in the proof, seems to answer my question. However, I fail to understand how that explains the particular scaling of u . I am not so familiar with complex analysis. I would be highly obliged if anyone can explain the scaling ($n^{1/6}$) and the reasoning mentioned here.","['complex-analysis', 'probability-theory', 'random-matrices', 'proof-explanation']"

Let $X$ be a first-countable topological space, let $A$ be a subset of $X$ and let $x\in X$. Then $x \in \operatorname{Int}A$   if and only if every sequence in X converging to $x$ is eventually in $A$. Some definitions: $\operatorname{Int}A$ is the union of all open sets contained in $A$.

 Then there exists a positive integer $N$

 For each $n=1,2,\ldots$,
 choose a point $x_n\in U_1\cap\cdots\cap U_n$

 Then $x_n\rightarrow x$ and this sequence is not eventually in $A$, in fact, none of the terms in sequence are in $A$. To see that  $x_n\rightarrow x$, let $U$

 then there exists some positive integer $k$

Prove that this turns the set of all complex numbers into an ordered set. Does this ordered set has the least-upper-bound property? In my attempt, I've been using Rudin's definition of an ordered field as a proof structure: Definition 1.17: An ordered field is a field $F$ which is also an ordered set , such that: $(1)$ $x+y<x+z$ if $x, y, z \in F$ and $y<z$ $(2)$ $xy>0$ if $x\in F, y \in F, x> 0,$ and $y>0$. There are some propositions about ordered fields Rudin provides as well which I can prove, but I'm stuck on a part of proving $(2)$. My attempt on $(2)$: Let $x =a+bi$, $y=c+di$. Since $0$ = $(0,0)$ or $0 + 0i$, by the problem's defined ordering, $x>0$ if $a > 0$ OR $a = 0$ and $b>0$. And $y>0$ if the same properties hold for $c, d$. $xy = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i$. There are four cases to consider if both $x >0$ and $y>0$: (1) $a >0, c>0$. What if $ac-bd<0$? $ac > 0$ but if $bd > ac$, then $xy$ is not greater than $0 + 0i$. (2) $a > 0, c = 0$ but $d > 0$. $ac = 0, bc = 0$, so $xy = -bd + (ad)i$. If $-bd < 0$, then $xy$ is not greater than $0 + 0i$. And so forth. Would appreciate any clarification on this. For the least-upper-bound property, does it suffice to state than for any non-empty subset $E = \{(c, d)\ :\ c, d \in \mathbb{R}\}$ of the set of complex numbers, we observe that all complex numbers are an ordered pair of real numbers and the real field has the least-upper-bound property so we can always find a complex number $(a, b)$, $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a$ and $b$ are supremums of the respective sets $\{c\}$ and $\{d\}$ as defined for subset $E$?",['real-analysis']

1876434,Central limit theorem for random variables with exactly a 2nd moment,"Consider $X_m$ which are independent, identically distributed random variables which have moments exactly up to order $2$ and no higher. This can be done in numerous ways. One is the following: let $a_n$ be a sequence of positive numbers that goes to zero and let $b_n$ be a sequence of positive numbers such that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{b_n}{a_n}$ converges. (For example, $a_n=1/n,b_n=2^{-n}$ does the job.) Let $f_n(x)=(2+a_n) 1_{[1,\infty)}(x) |x|^{-3-a_n}$. Then let $f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{b_n}{\sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k} f_n(x)$. Then $f$ is a pdf of a r.v. which has no higher moments than the second (since each $f_n$ has exactly moments of order strictly less than $2+a_n$). The assumption about $b_n$ ensures that it actually does have a finite second moment. (In effect the trick here is $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty [1,2+a_n)=[1,2]$.) Despite this somewhat pathological moment property, the classical central limit theorem still tells us that $\frac{\overline{X}_m-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{m}}$ converges in distribution to a $N(0,1)$ random variable. However, the most common quantitative estimates for the convergence rate, e.g. the Berry-Esseen theorem, require the existence of a moment higher than order $2$. What can be said about the convergence rate in cases like the one in the previous paragraph?","['probability-theory', 'central-limit-theorem']"
1876467,"How many turns, on average, does it take for a perfect player to win Concentration?","Let's say a person with perfect memory is playing the card-matching game Concentration . He/she randomly lays out 2n cards (ie. n card pairs) sorted randomly and repeatedly takes turns consisting of flipping over two cards, without looking at the first card . When the cards match they are removed from play. When cards do not match, they are turned back over. The player wins when all pairs are found and all cards are removed. A perfect game is played in just n turns, but even a perfect player (one with perfect memory) couldn't hope to come close to a perfect game as there would still be a lot of guessing required. How to you calculate the expected number of turns required to win for player with perfect memory? EDIT 2 -- clarifying the rules Since all the early answers seem to read this question as you CANNOT look at the first card, I'm editing that into the rules. I originally was thinking you CAN look at the first card (since that's how I'd learned the game and, to my knowledge, that is how it is usually played. For that rule adjustment, I've posted a new question here: How many turns, on average, does it take for a perfect player to win Concentration (adjusted)? EDIT -- Checking answers against a simulation The strategy proposed in AlgorithmsX's answer seems to make sense to me - that is, the game takes place in two distinct stages. Stage 1: flip all cards to learn where they are, and... Stage 2: clean up/perfectly find all matches (since you know where they are). Thus improving on a $2n$ turn game is pure chance; how many matches do you find in Stage 1? To check a given answer, I wrote the below code to simulate the problem. It just randomly shuffles an array with pairs from $0$ to $n-1$ and checks for adjacent pairs that would come up in the sweep during Stage 1 (so a 0-1 pair is a match, but 1-2 is not). This seems like a good way to check answers because (for me personally, at least) it's easier to reason about the simulation than the math. Currently, AlgorithmsX's answer for $n=3$ results in $5.6$, but I would expect it to be $5.4$ barring any errors in my simulation.

$\def\lfrac#1#2{{\large\frac{#1}{#2}}}$ I can mimic the derivation of the Poisson distribution in the following manner: Take any $n \in \mathbb{N}_{>c}\,\,.$ Partition each unit square of the plane into an $n \times n$ grid of square cells. With probability $\lfrac{c}{n^2}$ put a point into each cell, distributed uniformly within the cell, independently of other cells. Then every region comprising $n^2$ cells has expected number of points $c$. Also every pair of disjoint regions have independent numbers of points. Now if $n \to \infty$, I presume that this will more and more accurately resemble the desired distribution of points. But I have no idea how to take such a limit, nor what the limit distribution is!. I suspect it might be important that the cells are getting smaller in both dimensions, but I don't know. (If each square is partitioned into $n$ horizontal rectangles instead, each rectangle comprising $1 \times n$ cells, and the probability changed to $\lfrac{c}{n}$, the number of points in two vertical regions each comprising $n^2 \times 1$ cells will not be independent. This dependence might not affect the final limiting distribution, if such a limit exists at all, but a priori it is not clear to me.) So how can we rigorously define such a distribution, and is it really the limit of the above concept, in which case how do we rigorously define this limit?","['probability-theory', 'poisson-distribution', 'probability-distributions']"

1876746,Equality of two definitions of the Drinfeld Double,"While studying the Drinfeld Double of a Hopf algebra, I came across two different definitions used for the multipliaction. For a finite dimensional Hopf algebra $H$ (over a field $K$) we define $D(H)=H^{*cop}\otimes H$ (the Drinfeld double of H) as a Hopf algebra with the following structure:
    \begin{align*}
	&(\varphi \otimes g)(\psi \otimes h)= \psi_{(1)}(S^{-1}(g_{(3)}))\psi_{(3)}(g_{(1)})\varphi\psi_{(2)}\otimes g_{(2)}h		&& 1_{D(H)}=\varepsilon\otimes 1_H\\
	& \Delta ( \varphi \otimes h)=(\varphi_{(2)}\otimes h_{(1)}) \otimes (\varphi_{(1)}\otimes h_{(2)}) && \varepsilon(\varphi \otimes h)=\varphi(1)\varepsilon(h) \\
	& S(\varphi \otimes h)=(\varepsilon \otimes S(h))(S^{-1}(\varphi)\otimes 1).
	\end{align*} In addition I came across the following definition of the multiplication:
$$ (\varphi \otimes g)(\psi \otimes h)=\varphi(g_{(1)} \rightharpoonup \psi \leftharpoonup S^{-1}(g_{(3)}))\otimes g_{(2)}h .$$
The notation we use here is defined like this: Let $A$ be an algebra. For $a \in A$, $\varphi \in A^*$ we define $a \rightharpoonup \varphi, \varphi \leftharpoonup a \in A^*$ with $(a \rightharpoonup \varphi)(b)=\varphi(ba)$ and $(\varphi \leftharpoonup a)(b)=\varphi(ab)$ for every $b \in A$. My goal is to show that both multiplications are equal. This is my approach: \begin{align*}
(\varphi \otimes g)(\psi \otimes h) & = \psi_{(1)}(S^{-1}(g_{(3)}))\psi_{(3)}(g_{(1)})\varphi\psi_{(2)}\otimes g_{(2)}h \\
& = (\psi_{(1)} \leftharpoonup S^{-1}(g_{(3)}))(g_{(1)} \rightharpoonup \psi_{(3)})\varphi\psi_{(2)} \otimes g_{(2)}h
\end{align*}
On the other hand we have:
\begin{align*}
(\varphi \otimes g)(\psi \otimes h) & = \varphi(g_{(1)} \rightharpoonup \psi \leftharpoonup S^{-1}(g_{(3)}))\otimes g_{(2)}h  \\
& = \varphi(g_{(1)} \rightharpoonup \psi_{(2)})\psi_{(1)}(S^{-1}(g_{(3)})) \otimes g_{(2)}h \\
& = \varphi\psi_{(2)}(g_{(1)})\psi_{(1)}(S^{-1}(g_{(3)})) \otimes g_{(2)}h \\
& = \psi_{(1)}(S^{-1}(g_{(3)})) \psi_{(2)}(g_{(1)})  \varphi \otimes g_{(2)}h

As you can see, I am trying to show the equality by starting from both sides. But with my attempt at the bottom I am still missing a $\psi$ and have to make sure while adding it that it gets the right index. On the upper attempt I have to remove $\psi_{(2)}$ but do not see how it is done.","['abstract-algebra', 'hopf-algebras']"

I'm reasonably confident that the solutions are $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ and $f(x)=\frac{1}{2}$. Here's some progress: Let $P(x,y)$ be the assertion $f(x+y)(f(x)+f(y))=f(xy)$, and let $a=f(1)$. $P(1,1)\implies f(2)=\frac{1}{2}$. $P(2,1)\implies f(3)=\frac{1}{2a+1}$. $P(3,1)\implies f(4)=\frac{1}{2a^2+a+1}$. $P(4,1)\implies f(5)=\frac{1}{2a^3+a^2+a+1}$. $P(5,1)\implies f(6)=\frac{1}{2a^4+a^3+a^2+a+1}$. $P(2,3)\implies (2a-1)(a-1)(a+1)(2a^2+a+1)=0$ and so $\boxed{a\in\left\{-1,\frac{1}{2},+1\right\}}$. If $a=1$, then inductively $f(n)=\frac{1}{n}$ $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$. Let $x>0$. Then if $n\in\mathbb{N}$, considering $P(x+n,1)$ inductively, we get $f(x+n)=\frac{f(x)}{nf(x)+1}<\frac{1}{n}$, and so $P(x,n)\implies f(nx)=\frac{f(x)}{n}$. Thus $f(x)\leq\frac{1}{n}$ if $x\geq n$, so for $x\geq1$, we have $f(x)\leq\frac{1}{\lfloor x\rfloor}$. Then for $x>1$, inductively we have $$f(x)^{2^n}=f\left(x^{2^n}\right)\leq\frac{1}{\left\lfloor x^{2^n}\right\rfloor},$$ so taking the $2^n$th root and $n\to\infty$, we get $f(x)\leq\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x\geq1$ (Could someone verify that this part is rigorous?) . But since $f(2^nx)=\frac{f(x)}{2^n}$, we get $f(x)\leq\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x\geq\frac{1}{2^n}$. Again, taking $n\to\infty$, $f(x)\leq\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x>0$. Now $P\left(x,\tfrac{1}{x}\right)\implies1=f(1)=f(x+1/x)(f(x)+f(1/x))\leq1$, so $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ $\forall x>0$. However, I'm struggling first to extend this to $x<0$, and secondly to deal with the cases $a=\frac{1}{2}$, $a=-1$. EDIT: I've solved the problem. If $x<0$, then $f(x)^2=f\left(x^2\right)\implies f(x)=\pm\frac{1}{x}$. Choosing $n>|x|$, we have $$\frac{1}{x+n}=f(x+n)=\frac{f(x)}{nf(x)+1},$$and it is clear then that $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ $\forall x\in\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$, which is indeed a solution. If $f(1)=\frac{1}{2}$, then we claim that $\boxed{f(x)=\frac{1}{2}\;\forall x\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}}$ is the unique solution. Inductively, $f(n)=\frac{1}{2}$ $\forall n\in\mathbb N$. $P(x,1)\implies f(x+1)=\frac{2f(x)}{2f(x)+1}$, and thus $f(x+2)=\frac{4f(x)}{6f(x)+1}$ and $f(x+4)=\frac{16f(x)}{30f(x)+1}$. $P(x,2)\implies f(2x)=\frac{2f(x)(2f(x)+1)}{6f(x)+1}$. $P(2x,2)\implies f(4x)=\frac{4f(x)(2f(x)+1)(8f(x)^2+10f(x)+1)}{(6f(x)+1)(24f(x)^2+18f(x)+1)}$. $P(x,4)\implies f(4x)=\frac{8f(x)(2f(x)+1)}{30f(x)+1}$. Equating the two expressions for $f(4x)$, we get $(2f(x)-1)^2(2f(x)+1)(12f(x)+1)=0$. Thus $f(x)=\frac{1}{2}$ $\forall x\in\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$. If $f(1)=-1$, then we claim that there are no solutions. $P(x,1)\implies f(x+1)=\frac{f(x)}{f(x)-1}$, so $P(x+1,1)\implies f(x+2)=f(x)$. Thus $f(4)=f(2)=\frac{1}{2}$. But
\begin{align*}P(x,2)&\implies f(2x)=f(x+2)\left(f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)=f(x)\left(f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\\
P(x,4)&\implies f(4x)=f(x+4)\left(f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)=f(x)\left(f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\end{align*}Thus $f(x)=f(2x)=f(x)\left(f(x)+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\implies f(x)=\frac{1}{2}$ $\forall x\in\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$, a contradiction.","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions', 'functional-equations']"

\begin{align}
V=U+W
\end{align}
where $U$ is independent of $W$. My question is: We are interested in knowing whether such random variable $U$  exists or not and what methods can we used to check this. Known method: For me, the most obvious way is via characteristic functions. \begin{align}
\phi_V(t)=\phi_U(t) \cdot \phi_W(t)  \to  \phi_U(t)=\frac{\phi_V(t)}{\phi_W(t)}
\end{align} 
and we have to check if $\phi_U(t)$ is a proper characteristic function. Motivation: In order to show that there is no such transformation all we need is to check that  $\phi_U$ violates one of the properties of characteristic function.  For example, by showing that $|\phi_U(t)|>1$ for some $t$. To show that such a transformation indeed exists one has to check  that $\phi_U$ is a proper charcterstic function, which can be done via the following set of theorems ( see here ). Unfortunately, these theorems can be difficult to check and I was wondering if there is another method (not through characteristic functions) that can be used to prove or disprove existence of such transformations. For me, the more important direction is how to disprove the existence, which I guess amounts to showing some necessary condition and then checking if it holds. Proposed Example I know that the question I am asking can be fairly difficult to answer. So it might be a good idea to focus on a specific example: \begin{align}
2V=U+W

where
\begin{align}
V &\sim c_ve^{-v^{1.5}}, v\ge0\\
W & \sim c_We^{-w^{1.5-\epsilon_W}}, w\ge0

\begin{align}
 c_W= \frac{1.5-\epsilon_W}{\Gamma \left(\frac{1}{1.5-\epsilon_W}\right)}
\end{align} Why did I pick this example: On the one hand, computing anaylytic expression for the ChF's of this example might be impossible and motivates searching for new methods.  On the other hand, becuse pdf has an exponential which usually has some nice properties, make me think that there might be hope of answering this question. To solve the above question we distinguess three case: $\epsilon_W <0$,  $\epsilon_W =0$, $1.5\ge \epsilon_W >0$. Solution for $1.5\ge \epsilon_W >0$. Via a method outlined in one of the anwer we have that  for any $n$
\begin{align}
2 \ge  \left(\frac{E[V^n]}{E[W^n]} \right)^{1/n}.
\end{align}
For $1.5\ge \epsilon_W >0$ we can show that the RHS of the above equation can be made as larege as possible by choosing appropriate $n$ and we reach a contradiction. So, for the case of  $1.5\ge \epsilon_W >0$ transformation $2V=U+W$ is impossible. At this point, however, I do not know how to apporach the case of $\epsilon_W <0$ and the case of  $\epsilon_W =0$.

1877149,Some subtleties on zerodivisors in polynomial rings,"This question is based on two answers I saw. I want to know if my reasoning is correct in each case. For me, $A$ is always a commutative ring with $1 \ne 0$. In the first answer this proposition was given: Let $f_1,\dots,f_t\in A[X]$ be nonzero. If there is $0 \ne g\in A[X]$ such that $gf_1=\cdots=gf_t=0$, then there is $0 \ne a\in A$ such that $af_1=\cdots=af_t=0$. Assuming the case $t = 1$ which is McCoy's theorem, I think I can prove this as follows: Proof: Let $\displaystyle F := \sum_{i=1}^t f_i X^{\sum_{j < i} (1 + \deg f_j)}$. Then $gf_1 = \ldots = gf_t = 0 \implies gF = 0 \implies aF = 0$ for some $0 \ne a \in A \implies af_1 = \ldots = af_t = 0$. The last implication is because every coefficient of each $f_i$ appears exactly once as a coefficient of $F$.$\newcommand{\N}{\mathbb{N}}$ Question 1: Is the proof above correct? Moving on to the next question, in the other answer this proposition was given: (*) Let $A$ be a commutative $\N$-graded ring. Let $f \in A$ be a zerodivisor. Then there is some $0 \ne a \in A$ homogeneous such that $af = 0$. I think the proof given in that answer has a fatal flaw, which was pointed out as a comment but with no response. Specifically $\deg f_ig < \deg g$ may not be true. For polynomial rings in $1$ variable it's ok because $f_i = a_ix^i$ where $a_i$ has degree $0$ and $x^i$ is a nonzerodivisor, so $\deg a_ig < \deg g$ and $a_ig \ne 0$. So my second question is: Question 2: Is (*) true? If not, what is a counterexample? One note is that (*) is true if $A$ is Noetherian (since then every zerodivisor is in some associated prime, which is the annihilator of a homogeneous element). So a counterexample would have to be non-Noetherian.","['polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'proof-verification', 'graded-rings', 'commutative-algebra']"
1877180,Evaluating the sum $\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\ln[1-1/n^2]$,"For convenience the sum is again
$$
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\ln[1-1/n^2]=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\ln\frac{(n^2-1)}{(n^2)}
$$
I first tried solving using a definite integral, since this seems to make telescoping easier to see,
$$
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\ln\frac{(n^2-1)}{(n^2)}=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\ln(n^2-1)-\ln(n^2)=
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\int_{n^2}^{n^2-1}\frac{dx}{x}
$$
But writing out the first few terms doesn't make any cancellation obvious because of the $n^2$ terms. I also tried futzing around with log rules and got things down to 
$$
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\ln\frac{(n^2-1)}{(n^2)}=
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\ln((n-1)(n+1))-\ln(n^2)=
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\ln(n-1)+\ln(n+1)-\ln(n^2)
$$
The first few terms of which are
$$
\sum_{n=2}^{4}\ln\frac{(n^2-1)}{(n^2)}=[\ln1+\ln3-2\ln 2]+[\ln2+\ln4-2\ln 3]+[\ln3+\ln5-2\ln 4]+...\\
=\ln 2+\ln 5-2\ln 4
$$
Which leads to the guess that 
$$
\sum_{n=2}^{4}\ln\frac{(n^2-1)}{(n^2)}=\ln (N-1)+\ln(N+2)-2\ln(N)\\
=\ln(\frac{(N-1)(N+2)}{N^2})\rightarrow 0

1877202,Why is the Operator Norm so hard to calculate?,"I recently took a better look at the operator norm defined on a matrix $\mathbf A \in \Bbb{K}^{n\times n}$ as follows: $$
\|\mathbf A\|_p=\sup\{\|\mathbf Ax\|_p \mid x\in\Bbb{K}^n\land\|x\|=1\}
$$ The first time I looked at this I thought ""ok, lets calculate it for a few example matrices"". I started with $n = 3$ and $p = 2$, just to start ""simple"". Let
$$
\mathbf A = \left[\begin{matrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\end{matrix}\right]\quad a_{ij}\in\Bbb{K}^n
$$
Now if we're going to minimize $\|\mathbf Ax\|_2$ ($ = \|\mathbf Ax\|$), we might as well make it easy on ourselves and only minimize $\|\mathbf Ax\|^2$ so as to not worry about that annoying radical. We get
$$
\begin{align}
\|\mathbf Ax\|^2 & = (a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3)^2 + (a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3)^2 + (a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3)^2 \\
& = Ax_1^2 + Bx_2^2 + Cx_3^2 + Dx_1x_2 + Ex_1x_3 + Fx_2x_3
\end{align}
$$
where
$$
\begin{align}
A & = a_{11}^2+a_{21}^2+a_{31}^2 \\
B & = a_{12}^2+a_{22}^2+a_{32}^2 \\
C & = a_{13}^2+a_{23}^2+a_{33}^2 \\
D & = 2(a_{11}a_{12} + a_{21}a_{22} + a_{31}a_{33}) \\
E & = 2(a_{11}a_{13} + a_{21}a_{23} + a_{31}a_{33}) \\
F & = 2(a_{12}a_{13} + a_{22}a_{23} + a_{32}a_{33})
\end{align}
$$
Now lets define 
$$
G(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3) = Ax_1^2+Bx_2^2+Cx_3^2+Dx_1x_2+Ex_1x_3+Fx_2x_3
$$
So if we want to minimize $||\mathbf Ax||^2$, we're either going to have to minimize
$$
N(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3) = \frac{G(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3)}{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2}
$$
or simply minimize $G$ with the constraint $g(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = 1$. The latter seemed easier to me, so I gave it a shot using Lagrange multipliers. As usual, I defined 
$$
\mathcal{L}(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3,\ \lambda) = G(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3)-\lambda g(x_1,\ x_2,\ x_3)
$$
setting it's gradient to zero gives
$$
\nabla \mathcal L = 0 \implies \begin{cases}
2(A - \lambda)x_1 + Dx_2 + Ex_3 & = 0 \\
Dx_1 + 2(B - \lambda)x_2 + Fx_3 & = 0 \\
Ex_1 + Fx_2 + 2(C - \lambda)x_3 & = 0 \\
x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - 1 & = 0
\end{cases}
$$
Now this is where I really started to get stuck. I tried solving the first three equations for $x_1,\ x_2,$ and $x_3$ but didn't end up with anything I could use. I tried solving for $x_1$ in terms of $x_2,\ x_3,$ and $\lambda$, then $x_2$ in terms of $x_3$ and $\lambda$, and then subbing that all into the third equation, but ended up with either $x_3 = 0$ or 
$$
4\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2(A+B+C) + \lambda(4AB+4AC+4BC-D2+E^2+F^2)-4ABC-AF^2-BE^2+CD^2+DEF = 0
$$
which, although technically solvable for $\lambda$ via the cubic equation, would be incredibly messy. Now, I probably created my own roadblock for this problem, because I didn't want to think about the system of equations logically and just wanted to bash it out. Regardless of my approach, it seems like the operator norm is a very difficult thing to calculate, and I only analyzed the case where $n = 3$ and $p = 2$. What about the general case? What if $n = 75$ and $p = 9/4$? How on earth would you calculate it then? The questions above are rhetorical, however, and my actual question is as follows: Why define such an ordinary norm for matrices which is so difficult to calculate in general? I see the operator norm everywhere, and it seems like the standard norm for a lot of theorems (unless I'm mistaken and ||A|| just means any matrix norm). So why would we define such a standard norm in a way that is so difficult to calculate? What's the point? Is it easy to work with in theorems? I get that it intuitively makes sense as a norm, but it can't possibly be that easy to work with, especially in comparison to things like the Frobenius norm. So why do we care about this definition?","['matrices', 'normed-spaces', 'matrix-norms', 'definition']"

I'm trying to prove that if $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)=L$ then  $\lim_{x\to 0}f(cx)=L$ for any nonzero constant $c$. Proof: If  $\lim_{x \to 0}f(cx)=L$ then there exists some $\delta$ such that $0<|x|<\delta \implies |f(cx)-L|<\epsilon$. We have$ |f(cx)-L|=|f(cx)-L+f(x)-f(x)|$. Applying the triangle inequality gives $|f(cx)-L|=|f(cx)-L+f(x)-f(x)|\leq|f(cx)-f(x)|+|f(x)-L|$. So it suffices to find some $\delta$ such that $0<|x|<\delta \implies |f(cx)-f(x)|+|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$ Since $\lim_{x \to 0}f(x)=L$ there exists some $\delta_{1}$ such that $0<|x|<\delta_{1} \implies|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$. Since this must be true for any $\epsilon>0$, it must be true for some $\epsilon>|f(cx)-f(x)|+|f(x)-L|$. So, there exists some $\delta_{1}$ such that $0<|x|<\delta_{1} \implies |f(x)-L|\leq|f(cx)-f(x)|+|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$. Letting $\delta=\delta_{1}$ gives the desired $0<|x|<\delta \implies |f(cx)-f(x)|+|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$. Please tell me if I did anything invalid.

In the other side, in Munkres' Topology 2nd Ed, he introduces this axiom when needs to proove the existence of an injection $f: \mathbb{Z}^{+} \rightarrow A$, for the infinite set $A$.

Similarly, we say a surjection $B \xrightarrow{p} C$ splits iff $0 \to \ker p \to B \xrightarrow{p} C \to 0$ splits. Here are the definitions of injective and projective modules I'm using: $Q$ is injective if, and only if, $\operatorname{Hom}(\ast, Q)$ takes injections to surjections ($0 \to A \to B$ exact implies $\operatorname{Hom}(B,Q) \to \operatorname{Hom}(A,Q) \to 0$ exact). $P$ is projective if and only if $\operatorname{Hom}(P, \ast)$ takes surjections to surjections. Want to show: $Q$ is injective if and only if injections from $Q$ always split. The $\Longrightarrow$ direction is straightforward. The $\Longleftarrow$ direction, not so much. (Dummit and Foote relegates this to the exercises and uses the nontrivial fact that every module is contained in an injective module. I imagine this is to parallel their proof that $P$ is projective iff surjections to $P$ always split, which uses the fact that every module is a quotient of a free, hence projective, module.) It bothered me that these dual concepts don't have ""dual"" proofs, so I came up with one using pushouts and pullbacks (D&F introduce these in exercise 27, if you have the book). The argument is rather straightforward, so I feel like something has to be wrong, but I can't figure out what it is. Here it is: Suppose injections from $Q$ always split, suppose $i: A \to B$ injects, and suppose $f \in \operatorname{Hom}(A,Q)$. Consider the pushout of $i$ and $f$: $$M = B \oplus Q/\{(i(a), -f(a)): a \in A\}.$$ Then we get the following maps ""for free"": $j: B \to M$ and $g: Q \to M$, with $ji = gf$. (At this point, we haven't used any of our hypotheses.) Now, it's straightforward to check that $g$ injects because $i$ does, hence $g$ splits and we get a map $h: M \to Q$ with $hg = 1$. Thus, $hj$ lifts $f$. Verification that $g$ injects because $i$ does: If $g(q) = 0$, then $(0,q) = (i(a), -f(a))$ for some $a$. But $i(a) = 0$ implies that $ a = 0$, and this in turn implies that $-f(a) = 0$, so that $q = 0$. (A completely analogous proof using the pullback shows that: projections to $P$ always split $\implies P$ is projective.)

So you are more likely to see a $3$ when you take $1-100000$, than $1-10$ as the probability gets higher. So what I would like to know is as '$n$' approaches $∞$ does probability of seeing a '$3$' equals $0.99999....$? But since $0.9999... = 1$ wouldn't this not make sense, since there are infinitely many numbers that do not have a '$3$'? All I need is for an explanation as to why this logic is wrong. Simpler answers are most appreciated. Note I am not looking for the reason as to why 0.9999...=1.","['probability', 'limits']"
1877614,Is $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q}$ homeomorphic?,"Quick question: Is $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q}$ homeomorphic? Assuming equipped with the usual topology. I am guessing no, because a homeomorphism is a cardinality preserving closed map. Singletons are closed in $\mathbb{R}$, but they are neither closed nor open in $\mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}$. So $f(\{a\})$ is not closed. Not homeomorphic, bad! Right?",['general-topology']
1877713,"When finding $\sin\theta$ and $\cos\theta$ given $\tan\theta = \frac35$, shouldn't I get positive and negative answers?","Q: Find the exact value of $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta $ if $ \tan\theta=\frac{3}{5}$ To solve it I got told to draw the triangle and label the sides and then find cos and sin. The answer from the answer sheet gives both cos and sin as positive solutions. However, I thought that, since tan is positive in both the 1st and 3rd quadrants, then you could draw the triangle in those two quadrants. So, Why don't you get plus-minus solutions for $\sin\theta$ and $\cos\theta$ ?",['trigonometry']

I am wondering whether there are examples in mathematics or physics where the use of other linear connections is useful despite the fact that a Levi-Civita connection is available.",['differential-geometry']

How can we find the orthonormal basis of $\{(x_1,\dots,x_n) \in \Bbb R^n \mid x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n=0\}$? It is easy to find a basis, but using Gram-Schmidt procedure seems difficult to obtain an orthonormal one.","['orthonormal', 'linear-algebra']"
1877766,What is the Definition of Linear Algebra?,"For introducing a field of science, usually we require a definition which summarizes the goal which is intended to be achieved by this field. Linear Algebra is one of the most important parts of mathematics which has not only interesting pure mathematical ideas but also a lot of applications in physics and engineering. So it seems reasonable to have a Complete , Clear , Brief , and Delicate definition for this important branch of mathematics. I am wondering that what is the best fit for such a definition. For example, the very first sentence that the Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler starts with is Linear Algebra is the study of linear maps on finite dimensional vector spaces. What is your definition of Linear Algebra in few sentences?","['linear-algebra', 'soft-question', 'definition']"
