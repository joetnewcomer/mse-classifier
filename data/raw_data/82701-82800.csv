1079510,A question about eliminating square roots [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Why does the square root of a square involve the plus-minus sign? [duplicate] (2 answers) Why is the even root of a number always positive? (3 answers) Closed 9 years ago . If $\sqrt{x^2} = \pm x$, then why does $\sqrt{(x+2)^2} = x+2$ and not $\pm (x+2)$? This is driving me crazy, so feel free to elucidate. Thanks! ---EDIT--- I'm not sure how the other questions' answers would help answer my own question, but it doesn't really matter now that I've figured it out. After thinking a bit about some of what @Daniel Hast typed on a similar question I asked, I realized that the reason why $\sqrt{(x+2)^2} = x+2$ was that more generally, given that $\sqrt{x} = r$ such that $r^2 = x$, squaring $r$ in $\sqrt{x} = r$ produced $(\sqrt{x})^2 = r^2 = x$ and subsequently $(\sqrt{x})^2 = x$.",['algebra-precalculus']
1079537,What's the intution behind defining the cotangent sheaf as $\Delta^\ast(\mathscr{I}/\mathscr{I}^2)$?,"This definition seems to be given all over the place (e.g. Hartshorne II.8, Vakil 21.2.20, Wikipedia , McKernan's lecture notes from MIT ), and never with any explanation as to why the map $\Delta : X \to X \times X$ should have any relation to relative differentials.  Is this purely some kind of formal trick?  Is there an intuitive meaning to it?  Could it work with other maps than $\Delta$ , but $\Delta$ is just a convenient choice for some reason?",['algebraic-geometry']

1079575,Generalisation of $(n+3)^2-(n+2)^2-(n+1)^2+n^2=4$,"After seeing the neat little identity $(n+3)^2-(n+2)^2-(n+1)^2+n^2=4$ somewhere on MSE, I tried generalising this to higher consecutive powers in the form
$\sum_{k=0}^a\epsilon_k(n+k)^p=C$, where $C$ is a constant and $\epsilon_k=\pm1$. I discovered a relatively simple algorithm to generate these patterns: simply take $(n+2^p-1)^p$ and subtract $(n+2^p-2)^p$ (using $n\to n-1$) to get a polynomial of degree $p-1$. Take this difference and subtract $(n+2^p-3)^p-(n+2^p-4)^p$ (using $n\to n-2$) to get a polynomial of degree $p-2$. Repeat this process until $n^p$ is reach. The first few examples of this are
$$
\begin{align}
n^0&=1\\
(n+1)^1-n^1&=1\\
(n+3)^2-(n+2)^2-(n+1)^2+n^2&=4\\
(n+7)^3-(n+6)^3-(n+5)^3+(n+4)^3-(n+3)^3+(n+2)^3+(n+1)^3-n^3&=48
\end{align}
$$
Upon doing this for the next several powers and checking OEIS , it would appear the constant corresponding to the power $p$ is $$\large C_p=2^{\frac{p(p-1)}2} p!$$
However, this is an observation only, and I have no idea how to go about proving this. The only thing I notice is that $\frac{p(p-1)}{2}=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{p-1}k$, but I don't know how to use this fact. Does any one know how to prove this observation?","['finite-differences', 'exponentiation', 'sequences-and-series', 'polynomials']"

$(g\circ f)(\Bbb N\times\Bbb N)=\operatorname{Id}(\Bbb N\times\Bbb N)$. Therefore $f$ is a bijective function. And $f^{-1}=g$. Please help find why I'm a fool and where is the mistake.",['elementary-set-theory']
1079636,The expectation over an infinitesimal time interval,"I have a deduction which I would like to formalize (I suppose with some additional measure theory): Let $N(t)\sim Pois(\lambda_t)$, where $\lambda_t$ is stochastic (we are thus looking at a Cox process).

\mathbb{E}\left[dN(t)\bigg|\mathcal{G}_t\right]=1-e^{-\lambda_t dt}=(1-(1-\lambda_tdt))=\lambda_tdt.
\end{equation} The reasoning behind the deduction is that $dN(t)$ is the probability that an event occurs in the infinitesimal time interval $dt$. The probability of no default within the time interval $[a,b]\in\mathbb{R}$ is given by \begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\left[e^{-\int_a^b\lambda_sds}\right]

1079740,Local Noetherian domain of dimension one with principal maximal ideal,"Let $(A,\mathfrak{m})$ be a local Noetherian domain of dimension one and suppose that $\mathfrak{m}$ is principal. I wish to show that every non-zero ideal of $A$ is a power of $\mathfrak{m}$. I have tried to prove it as follows and I would be most grateful if someone would check the proof for me. Proof: I make use of three facts: In a local Noetherian domain of dimension one, every proper, non-zero ideal contains some power of the maximal ideal. Artinian = Noetherian of dimension zero. In a local Artinian ring with principal maximal ideal, every non-zero ideal is a power of the maximal ideal. Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be a non-zero ideal of $A$. If $\mathfrak{a}=A$, then $\mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{m}^0$ so we may assume that $\mathfrak{a}$ is proper. By fact 1, we have $\mathfrak{m}^n\subset\mathfrak{a}$ for some $n\geq 2$. Let $q:A\to A/\mathfrak{m}^n$ be the (surjective) quotient homomorphism and let $\mathfrak{M}=q(\mathfrak{m})$. Observe that $\mathfrak{m}^2\neq\mathfrak{m}$, otherwise we would have $\mathfrak{m}=(0)$ by Nakayama. As prime ideals of $A$ correspond exactly to prime ideals of $A/\mathfrak{m}^n$ containing $\mathfrak{m}^n$ we see that $A/\mathfrak{m}^n$ has a unique prime ideal, namely $\mathfrak{M}\neq 0$ (non-zero as $\mathfrak{m}^2\neq\mathfrak{m}$), and so it is a local ring (with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{M}\,$). By fact 2, it follows that $A/\mathfrak{m}^n$ is Artinian. Moreover, since $\mathfrak{m}$ is principal, so is $\mathfrak{M}$. Hence, by fact 3, we have that every ideal of $A/\mathfrak{m}^n$ is a power of $\mathfrak{M}$; in particular, $q(\mathfrak{a})=\mathfrak{M}^r$ for some $r \in \mathbb{N}$ and so $\mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{m}^r$.

1079757,Two definitions of embedded submanifold,"Let $N$ be a smooth manifold. One possible definition (I believe) for an embedded submanifold of $N$ is some $M \subset N$ that is a (smooth) manifold such that the inclusion $i : M \hookrightarrow N$ is an embedding. Another more classical definition says that for each $p \in M$ we can find a chart $\psi : V \subset N \rightarrow \widetilde{V} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$, let's say with $\psi(p) = 0$, such that $\psi(V \cap M) = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \widetilde{V}\ |\ x_{m + 1} = \ldots = x_n = 0\}$.

However, for the equality $\psi(V \cap M) = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \widetilde{V}\ |\ x_{m + 1} = \ldots = x_n = 0\}$ to be not a mere inclusion of the left side into the right side, I believe I would need to have $U = V \cap M$.

The author doesn't explain it, but gives the proof right away (which I understand). But I'm trying to figure out what this theorem actually states, and why it is so important? So in words it means: if I have a basis for my domain, and a basis for my codomain, then there exists just one linear transformation that links both of them. So let's say I have a linear map $T: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ , with $T(1,0) = (1,4)$ and $T(1,1)=(2,5)$ . So because $(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$ is a basis for my domain, it is an implication of the theorem that $(1,4)$ and $(2,5)$ is automatically a basis for my codomain?","['linear-transformations', 'linear-algebra']"

I do not understand the intuition behind the answer http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/4045/moves-editorial Suppose that the robot always takes the ""right"" move at first.

1080164,Analogue of the Hecke operator for a general curve,"Background :
The eigenvalues of the Hecke opeator $T_p$ on the space of cusp forms $S_2(\Gamma_0(N))$ (of dimension $g=\text{genus}(X_0(N))$) are analysed using reduction mod $p$ and the use of the Eichler-Shimura relation on the Tate module of the Jacobian of the reduction mod $p$ of $X_0(N)$. I will denote the Tate module of the Jacobian by $H^1$ (to stand for etale cohomology), although I don't yet feel comfortable with etale cohomology. Now, working mod $p$, $\text{Frob}+\text{Ver}$ acts on $H^1$ which is of dimension $2g$. But all the eigenvalues are real and each appears twice. Question :
Given a smooth projective curve $C$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$, let the $2g$ eigenvalues of $\text{Frob}$ on $H^1$ be $\alpha_1,\dotsc,\alpha_g$ and their conjugates $\overline{\alpha_1},\dotsc,\overline{\alpha_g}$. Is there a natural way to get a $g$-dimensional vector space $V$ and an operator $T:V\rightarrow V$ with eigenvalues $\alpha_1+\overline{\alpha_1},\dotsc,\alpha_g+\overline{\alpha_g}$? Remark : Of course, we can always define such an operator. My question is whether there are natural constructions of such pairs $V,T$ from the curve $C$. Specific answers for specific curves would still be very nice. One example is of course: If $C$ is the reduction mod $p$ of the modular curve $X_0(N)$ (assume $p\nmid N$), then we can take $T_p$ to be the Hecke operator on $V=S_2(\Gamma_0(N))$. So, in a sense I'm looking for an analogue of $T_p$ and $S_2(\Gamma_0(N))$ for a smooth projective curve $C$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$ which is not necessarily the reduction of $X_0(N)$ mod $p$. Some ideas : Maybe it's always (or sometimes) possible to lift $C$ to a curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, and also to lift $\text{Frob}+\text{Ver}$ and look at the action of the lift on the space of holomorphic differentials on the lifted curves (viewed as a complex curve)?

1080200,Is this a correct application of Poincaré-Bendixson?,"Consider a non-vanishing $C^1$ vector field $f$ on a neighbourhood of the annulus with radii $1$ and $2$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The vector field is transversal to the boundary of the annulus and points inward. Prove that there is a closed orbit solving $\dot x = f(x)$. Prove also that if exactly $7$ closed orbits exist, then there exist associated orbits that spiral towards one of the closed orbits from both sides. Here is my work so far: Because $f$ is transversal and points inwards, the orbits inside the annulus do not leave the annulus (since if they did, the vector field would have to point outward from the annulus). The Poincaré-Bendixson theorem states that any compact $\omega$-limit set of an orbit must be a periodic orbit (since no fixed points exist), so for the orbits inside the annulus there should be two possibilities: either they are periodic orbits, or their limit sets are periodic orbits. So clearly at least one periodic orbit has to exist, and if any non-periodic orbits exist, they must spiral towards a periodic orbit. To prove that non-periodic orbits exist, use the fact that exactly $7$ periodic orbits exist. Each of these periodic orbits is a loop inside the annulus, but finitely many loops cannot cover the entire annulus. So there exist points that do not belong to any periodic orbit, and therefore have a non-periodic orbit. These arguments feel a bit shaky.

1080282,Symmetric Group Action on a Set of Functions,"I'm not understanding the following passage and I'm hoping someone could elucidate (for context, this is in the lead up to the definition of the sign of a permutation) where the author says: Let $f$ be a function of $n$ variables, say $f\space\colon\mathbb{Z}^n\to\mathbb{Z}$, so we can evaluate $f\left(x_1,\ldots,x_n\right)$. Let $\sigma$ be a permutation of $J_n$ (the author previously defined $J_n=\left\{1,\ldots,n\right\}$). We define the function $\pi\left(\sigma\right)f$ by $$\pi\left(\sigma\right)f\left(x_1,\ldots,x_n\right)=f\left(x_{\sigma\left(1\right)},\ldots,x_{\sigma\left(n\right)}\right).$$
  Then for $\sigma,\tau\in{S_n}$ we have $\pi\left(\sigma\tau\right)=\pi\left(\sigma\right)\pi\left(\tau\right)$. Indeed, we use the definition applied to the function $g=\pi\left(\tau\right)f$ to get
  \begin{align*}
\pi\left(\sigma\right)\pi\left(\tau\right)f\left(x_1,\ldots,x_n\right)&=\left(\pi\left(\tau\right)f\right)\left(x_{\sigma\left(1\right)},\ldots,x_{\sigma\left(n\right)}\right)\\
&=f\left(x_{\sigma\tau\left(1\right)},\ldots,x_{\sigma\tau\left(n\right)}\right) \\
&=\pi\left(\sigma\tau\right)f\left(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\right).
\end{align*}
  Since the identity in $S_n$ operates as the identity on functions, it follows that we have obtained an operation of $S_n$ on the set of functions. Now if I let $G$ be the set of functions $\mathbb{Z}^n\to\mathbb{Z}$, then I agree  the mapping $S_n\times G\to G$ defined by $\left(\varpi,f\left(x_1,\ldots,x_n\right)\right)\mapsto{f\left(x_{\varpi\left(1\right)},\ldots,x_{\varpi\left(n\right)}\right)}$ is well-defined since functions are well-defined, by definition. Where I get lost is (and let me note how pleased I am that the align* environment works)
\begin{align*}
\pi\left(\sigma\right)\pi\left(\tau\right)f\left(x_1,\ldots,x_n\right)&=\left(\pi\left(\tau\right)f\right)\left(x_{\sigma\left(1\right)},\ldots,x_{\sigma\left(n\right)}\right)\\
&=f\left(x_{\sigma\tau\left(1\right)},\ldots,x_{\sigma\tau\left(n\right)}\right) \\
&=\pi\left(\sigma\tau\right)f\left(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\right).
\end{align*} I would go about it as
\begin{align*}
\pi\left(\sigma\right)\pi\left(\tau\right)f\left(x_1,\ldots,x_n\right)&=\pi\left(\sigma\right)f\left(x_{\tau\left(1\right)},\ldots,x_{\tau\left(n\right)}\right)\\
&=f\left(x_{\sigma\tau\left(1\right)},\ldots,x_{\sigma\tau\left(n\right)}\right) \\
&=\pi\left(\sigma\tau\right)f\left(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\right).
\end{align*} I'm not sure why the author used $\left(\pi\left(\tau\right)f\right)$ in the RHS of the first line of the aligned equation instead of  $\left(\pi\left(\tau\right)f\left(x_{\sigma\left(1\right)},\ldots,x_{\sigma\left(n\right)}\right)\right)$ and I don't follow why the $\pi(\sigma)$ term 'acts' first.

1080336,Adjoining a number to a field,"When I studied algebra, we talked about fields such as $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]$, the rational numbers with the square root of two adjoined to the field.

My question is when we talk about these structures, are we saying we add the square root of two and its (multiplicative) inverse, or just the square root of two and any numbers necessary to keep the closure property of our field satisfied? If the latter is the case, is this part of what makes transcendental numbers so significant? If we only add the transcendental number to the field, and all numbers necessary to keep the closure, there is no way to obtain an inverse for that number. This is unlike the square root of 2, whose inverse can be written as $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, which would be in the extension by closure.

For further info, i.e. on how to derive the maximum likelihood estimator for $\Sigma$ you could take a look at David MacKay's book, section 43 MacKay calls it $W$) http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/ps/521.526.pdf Original Question: I am trying to calculate the sum $$ 
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\forall x} x^T \Sigma x 
 $$ where $\Sigma$ is a symmetric, positive definite matrix, $x$ is a column vector with binary values. I can assume normalization of $\Sigma$ as another step (so that all rows sum to 1), if that will give me convergence. $\Sigma$ is the result of cooccurence calculation $A^TA$ on sample data that contains only binary values, 0 or 1. I ran some numerical experiments on randomly generated samples, from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(0)
A = np.random.randint(0,2,(100,4))
cooc = A.T.dot(A).astype(float)
cc = normalize(cooc, norm='l1', axis=1) When I apply the formula, that is, run through all possible values of $x \in \{0,1\}^n$, and calculate the sum, import itertools, numpy.linalg as lin
lst = np.array(list(itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=A.shape[1])))
s = 0
for x in lst: 
    s += np.dot(np.dot(x.T,cc), x) / 2
print s I get 11.15 on data with 4 dimensions. For n=5 I get around 26.6, on any sample I generate with these dimensions. From this I concluded this number is directly tied to the dimension I am working with, and is a constant, so I was wondering if it could be calculated as a limit, somehow. Note: I need this number as a normalization constant, I plan to use $p(x;\Sigma) = \frac{1}{2C} x^T \Sigma x$ as a probability mass function. Here is how I arrived to this question. I was trying to capture frequency of each single variable and dependency between all variables of multivariate binary samples. I used a simple cooccurence calculation on the sample, import numpy as np
A = np.array([\
[0.,1.,1.,0],
[1.,1.,0, 0],
[1.,1.,1.,0],
[0, 1.,1.,1.],
[0, 0, 1.,0]
])
c = A.T.dot(A).astype(float)
print c Result [[ 2.  2.  1.  0.]
 [ 2.  4.  3.  1.]
 [ 1.  3.  4.  1.]
 [ 0.  1.  1.  1.]] Now for any new data point $x$, if I wanted to calculate a ""score"", ex: x = np.array([[0,1,1,0]])
print np.dot(np.dot(x.T,c), x) / 2 would give me 7. The formula basically picks numbers 4,3,3,4 in the middle block of the cooc matrix, and sums them, which was what I wanted because new data point $x=[0,1,1,0]$ has binary variables 2 and 3 turned on (is 1) so I am interested in the dependency between $x_2$ and $x_3$, as well as the frequency of the variables by themselves. Once I had this score, I started wondering if I could turn this function into a PMF, hence the need for normalization constant and the need to integrate the function for all possible values of $x$. I toyed with the idea of dividing the sum by $x^Tx$, thereby causing the equation to look like the Rayleigh Quotient, $$ 
= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\forall x} \frac{x^T \Sigma x }{x^Tx}
 $$ then, if I assumed ""x=all eigenvalues"" instead of ""x=all possible values"" then perhaps summing all eigenvalues would give me something. But the summation must be for all x. Representing all x's using eigenvectors as basis maybe.. ?","['multivariable-calculus', 'linear-algebra']"

1080639,Question about the construction of Mukai flop,"Let X be a symplectic complex manifold of dimension $2n $, i.e. there exists a non degenerate holomorphic 2-form $\sigma $ such that $ H^0 (X,\Omega^2)=\mathbb {C}\cdot\sigma $. Suppose that there exists a submanifold $ P\subset X $ such that $P\cong\mathbb {P}^n $. Let $\tilde {X} $ be the blow up of X along P. Using the Euler sequence and the symplectic structure $\sigma $, we can show that the projection of the exceptional divisor $ D=\mathbb {P}(\mathcal {N}_{P/X}) $ on $\mathbb {P}^n $ is isomorphic to the projective bundle $\mathbb {P}(\Omega_P) $. Hence we can identify it with the incidence variety
$$ \{(x, H)\,|\, x\in H\}\subset\mathbb {P}^n\times(\mathbb {P}^n)^*.$$
So we can project on the dual projective space $(\mathbb {P}^n)^*$ and define a blow down $\tilde {X}\to X'$. The Mukai flop is then the birational map $ X---> X'$ obtained by composing the blow up and the blow down. My question is about the existence of the blow down: why does it exist? Which are the hypothesis we must check to say that a contraction is a blow down? Reference are very welcome! Thank you very much!",['algebraic-geometry']
1080665,Expansion for r-associated Stirling numbers of the second kind,"I am looking for a paper or guidance for expanding the r-associated Stirling numbers of the second kind $S_r(n,k)$. $S_r(n,k)$  is the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k subsets, with each subset containing at least r elements. I want to calculate $S_r(n,k,b)$ which also counts the number of times b that a subset contains exactly r elements. It is obvious that $S_r(n,k)=\sum_{b=0}^kS_r(n,k,b)$ but can I get an analytic expression for $S_r(n,k,b)$? I think it is possible to solve this with generating functions but I can use some guidance.","['stirling-numbers', 'balls-in-bins', 'set-partition', 'generating-functions', 'combinatorics']"
1080688,Strictly monotonically increasing sequences of natural numbers,"I have several questions with regards to these sequences: What is the cardinality of the set of all such sequences? I assume that it is equal to the cardinality of $\mathbb{R}$, is that correct? Consider those sequences which can be expressed with a finite formula. Is the cardinality of the set of those sequences equal to the cardinality of $\mathbb{R}$? Are there any other sequences which cannot be expressed with a finite formula? I have a feeling that this question might lead to a paradox, hence cannot be answered. Nevertheless, my intuition tells me that there have to be infinitely many such sequences. How can we prove that, and how can we find the cardinality of the set of those sequences? Examples of a finite formula: $A_n=n$ $An=2n$ $An=$ the $n$th prime $A_1=1,A_2=2,A_n=A_{n-1}+A_{n-2}$ $A_n=\begin{cases}

1080723,Calculating the equation of a multivariable surface of revolution,"I'm stucked with a surface equation problem so I would be very thankful if someone could help me with it. What the excercise says: Find the equation of the revolution surface that is spanned when the curve $xy=10$, $z=0$ is spinned around the axis $y=x$, $z=0$ My approach: I know that the axis direction is described by the vector $d=(1,1,0)$, so when I let Q(u,v,w) be a point in the curve and P(x,y,z) be a point of the surface spanned by the rotation of Q around the given axis, I have 2 equations:
\begin{equation}
u+v=t
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x+y=t
\end{equation}
I deduced that from the fact that P and Q are in the same plane that is normal to the axis. I also have the equations:
\begin{equation}
uv=10
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
w=0
\end{equation}
Of course that is inmediate because Q(u,v,w) is a point in the curve. I tried using the third equation so I could have $v=\frac{10}{u}$, then because of that and equation 3 we would have
$$u^2-tu+10=0$$
By solving that I obtain
$$u=\displaystyle\frac{t+-\sqrt{t^2-40}}{2}$$
And there is my great dilema, how do I know which of the two possibles $u$ must I choose? I would be very, very thankful if someone could answer me this. Greetings!","['multivariable-calculus', 'surfaces']"

My question is: could you point out some (a ""big-list"" of) problems [by referencing them] presented in this book that are, in principle, accessible to undegraduate students: i.e. , problems that refer to (and possibly might be solved by applying) definitions, concepts, and theorems that are presented in a book like Herstein's Topics in Algebra (and then, by extension, in an abstract algebra course for undergraduates). The aim of this question is to allow undergraduate students to have a better understanding of current research in algebra by letting them see concretely open problems that can be easily related to known concepts.","['big-list', 'soft-question', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

(a+1-1)(a+1+1)+(b-1)^2+2(a^2+b^2)>0\\

$a^2$ and $(b-1)^2$ and  $2(a^2+b^2)$ are always positive and greater than zero, when $a>0$ our inequality is proved. However when a is negative I can not say $2a$ is always less than or equal to $a^2$.
