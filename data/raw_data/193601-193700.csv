3711156,discrete metric converges iff it is eventually constant,"I have read previous answers about the proof but there is a small point I want to be sure of. First if we assume that the sequence converges $x_n \to x$ there for all $N\leq n$ there is $\varepsilon >0$ s.t $d(x_n,x)< \varepsilon$ Let $\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}$ , because $x_n$ converges there is $N\leq n_0$ such that $d(x_{n_0},x)< \frac{1}{2}$ , now if $x_{n_0}\neq x$ then by definition of the discrete metric $d(x_{n_0},x)= 1$ with is a contradiction and therefore it must be that $x_{n_0}=x$ which means that $x_n$ is eventually constant. Second if $x_n$ is eventually constant that means that there is $N\leq n_0$ such that $x_{n_0}=x_{n_0+1}=...$ why can we assume that $x_{n_0}=x_{n_0+1}=...=x$ ?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"
3711175,Hilbert polynomials of closed subschemes $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n_k$,"Let $k$ any field and $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n_k$ closed subscheme. We are going
to study the Hilbert polynomials in reversal sense: Let recall a Hilbert polynomial associated to a coherent sheaf $F$ on $X=\mathbb{P}^n_k$ together with line bundle $O_X(1)$ is a polynomial $$\Phi(t) = \sum_{i=0} ^n (-1)^i h^i(X, F \otimes O_X(1)^{\otimes t} )=
\sum_{i=0} ^n (-1)^i h^i(X, F (t))
\in \mathbb{Q}[t]  $$ The Hilbert polynomial associated to a closed subscheme $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n_k$ as in our case defined by homogeneous ideal sheaf $I_Y$ it the Hilbert polynomial
   of the quotient sheaf $O_Y= O_X/I_Y$ . Two examples $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n_k$ can be easily computed: (i) $Y \cong \mathbb{P}^r_k$ embedded linearly in $\mathbb{P}^n_k$ over $k$ has Hilber polynomial $\Phi^Y(t)= \binom{r+ t}{r}$ (ii) $Y$ is a hypersurface $H_d$ of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^n_k$ defined
by a homogeneous polynomial $f \in k[x_0,...,x_n]$ obtains HP $\Phi_d^Y(t)= \binom{n+ t}{n}- \binom{n-d+ t}{n}$ The (ii) follows easily from exact sequence $ 0 \to O_{\mathbb{P}^n_k}(-d) \to O_{\mathbb{P}^n_k} \to O_{H_d} \to 0 $ , the additivity of Hilbert polynomials for exact sheaf sequences and previous case (i). Now the question is how to show that cases (i) & (ii) can be reversed: (i) If closed subscheme $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n_k$ has Hilbert polynomial $\Phi^Y(t)= \binom{r+ t}{r}$ , 
why $Y \cong \mathbb{P}^r_k$ and embedded linearly in $\mathbb{P}^n_k$ over $k$ ? (ii) if $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n_k$ has Hilbert polynomial $\Phi_d^Y(t)= \binom{n+ t}{n}- \binom{n-d+ t}{n}$ , why $Y$ is a hypersurface $H_d$ of degree $d$ . On (ii) the paper by Nitsure on the construction of Hilbert scheme that originally motivates this question 
has a hint (page 6): If $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n_k $ is a closed subscheme with
Hilbert polynomial of degree $n − 1$ , then show that the schematic 
closure $Z$ of the
height $1$ primary components is a hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^n_k$ with $\operatorname{deg}(Z) = \operatorname{deg}(Y)$ . Contextually the ""height $1$ primary components"" of $Y$ seems to be 
the irreducible components of $Y$ of codimension $1$ . Why the author called it ""primary""
I not know. The Zariski topology don't draw a difference between prime ideals
and primary ideals having primes as their radicals. Nevertheless I assume that 
the hint refers to irreducible components $C_{i, max} \subset Y$ of maximal dimension. Set $Z:= \overline{\bigcup_i C_{i, max}}$ and the claim is $\operatorname{deg}(Z) = \operatorname{deg}(Y)$ . Why does this equality hold?
And why this implies that $Y$ is hypersurface of degree $d$ ?","['algebraic-geometry', 'hilbert-polynomial', 'sheaf-theory']"

3711261,Books on linear algebra more focused towards matrices and determinants rather than vector spaces,"In my syllabus of a competitive exam, we have matrices and determinants and solving linear equations with them instead of linear algebra but during examinations a lot of the times questions are derived from linear algebra and presented such that they can be tackled by matrices and determinants but are tedious. Eg, they will give a 2×2 matrix and then give 4 polynomial as options , where one of them would be a characteristic polynomial. So anyone who know about Cayley-Hamilton Theorem, will easily solve this quickly. So are there any books  available that have a lot of these properties like properties of eigenvectors, idempotent, nilpotent matrices,symmetric, skew symmetric etc. Most of the popular books revolve around teaching the vector spaces and that part really well. I have studied linear algebra from MIT OCW by Gilbert Strang and have partially read his book on the subject too, so even if the book has some parts from vector spaces (which it probably will) , I believe, I will probably be able to comprehend what the author is trying to convey.

3711487,Is this a 'legal' way to show two sets not equal?,"Part A. Suppose that for all $x$ , $x$ is in a set $X$ iff it is not in another set $Y$ . Neither $X$ nor $Y$ is the empty set. And there is a background set Z in which these sets lurk and to which everything is relative. So when we say 'not in another set Y' this is a relative complement between Y and Z, not an absolute complement. From these assumptions, can we derive that $X \neq Y?$ Proof. If $X=Y,$ then $x$ is a member of $X$ if it is not a member of $X$ -- a contradiction. QED. From the definition, did we prove that $X$ can't equal $Y$ and put a proper restriction on what those sets can be? Or did we show that $X$ is just not well-defined? Part B. Can this method be 'scaled' to show a set V is not in a certain set R? I reference a set of sets $R$ in my definition of a set $V$ . Any $v$ is a member of $V$ iff it is not a member of any of the sets in the set $R$ . It seems that, similar to how we showed inequality before, by definition, we have forced $V$ not be in the set $R$ ; otherwise, we have a contradiction: $v$ is a member of $V$ if it is not a member of $V$ .
Here is the specific example: For all $v$ , $v$ is in $V$ iff $v$ is not in any of these sets: $(W,S,U,T)$ which form a set called $R$ . From this assumption can we derive that $V$ is not in the set $R$ ? And again, not being in $W, S, U, T$ is relative to a background set $Z$ .","['elementary-set-theory', 'logic']"

3711643,Why is it the (group) morphisms that matter?,"I often hear people saying things like: one only really understands groups if one looks at group homomorphisms between them one only really understands rings if one looks at ring homomorphisms between them ...

I can appreciate that it's quite cool that one can characterize constructions such as the free group or the direct product of groups just in terms of their relation to other groups (and in this sense, the morphisms from and to that construction help to understand the construction better). But besides, I'm struggling to appreciate the usefulness of homomorphisms. I understand that what one is interested in is groups up to isomorphism (one wants to classify groups ), so the notion of isomorphism seems to me to be very fundamental, but the notion of a homomorphism seems to me in some sense just to be a precursor the fundamental notion of an isomorphism. I guess it would help if some of you could point me to bits and pieces of group theory where homomorphisms (instead of isomorphisms) are essential. In which sense do group homomorphisms help us to understand groups itself better? Of course, I could ask the same question about ring theory or some other subfield of mathematics. If you have answers why morphisms matter in these fields, then feel free to tell me! After all, what I'm interested in is examples of the usefulness of homomorphisms from down to earth concrete mathematics, so what I don't want is just category theoretic philosophy jabbering (this is not to say I don't like category theory, but for the purpose of this question I'm interested in why morphisms matter in specific subfields of mathematics such as group theory).","['group-homomorphism', 'group-theory', 'soft-question', 'category-theory']"

Intuitively, I guess that it's the parallel transport from $T_p M$ to $T_{p_0}M$ , where $p$ represents the argument. Is this correct in general? Does it hold in any special cases? So far, I mainly focus on two cases, but I welcome any more general results. $M$ is a Riemannian manifold and $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection. $M$ is a Lie group and $\nabla$ represents the canonical left-invariant connection, so the exponential mapping is the usual one on Lie group. Please enlighten me with any related results, examples or references. Thank you!","['riemannian-geometry', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"
3711910,"Will orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the plane preserve ""positively oriented"" domains?","Background: Let $T:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ be an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism, i.e. $\det(T')$ is everywhere positive in $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Let $\gamma:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ be a simple closed smooth regular plane curve such that it is positively oriented : the bounded component of $\mathbb{R}^2\backslash\gamma([a,b])$ , call it D, lies on the left-hand side of $\gamma.$ More rigorously, $\forall t\in[a,b], \exists \epsilon=\epsilon(t)>0$ such that $\gamma(t)+i\cdot\epsilon(t) \dot\gamma(t)\in D$ . Similarly we can define orientation-reversing diffeomorphisms and negatively oriented domains. Question: $T^{-1}\circ\gamma$ be positively oriented with respect to $T^{-1}(D)$ ? Moreover, if $T$ is orientation-reversing ( $\det(T')<0$ everywhere), will $T^{-1}\circ\gamma$ be negatively oriented with respect to $T^{-1}(D)$ ? Motivation: This fact is used in a proof of change of variable formula (for double integrals) via Green's theorem which requires the domain of integration to be positively oriented. For details see Exercise 15 of Section 7, Chapter 1 of Manfredo do Carmo's differential geometry book .

3711921,Equinumerosity: Proof Validation,"Synopsis In my studying of Set Theory, I've had the privilege of being able to compare much of my work to a solutions manual. This solutions manual, however, ended after the chapter on the various number systems. As such, I'm going to start posting a lot of my own personal solutions or questions onto the site for either proof validation or proof hints (if I'm unable to find the solution in other places), and I would greatly appreciate any feedback on my mathematical writing. Thank you. Exercise Show that the equation $$f(m, n) = 2^m(2n + 1) - 1$$ defines a one-to-one correspondence between $\omega \times \omega$ and $\omega$ . Proof First, we show that $f$ is injective. Consider $(m, n)$ and $(m', n')$ in $\omega \times \omega$ . Now suppose that $f(m, n) = f(m', n')$ . Then $2^{m}(2n+1) - 1 = 2^{m'}(2n' + 1) - 1$ and $2^{m}(2n+1) = 2^{m'}(2n' + 1)$ . Note that every value of this equation will only have one odd factor, mainly $(2n + 1)$ . As such, $n = n'$ and $2^m = 2^{m'}$ . So, $m = m'$ and $f$ is injective. Next, we wish to show that $f$ is surjective. Consider any $x \in \omega$ . If $x$ is even, take $m = 0$ and $n = x/2$ . If $x$ is odd, note that $x = 2k + 1$ for some $k \in \omega$ . So $2k = 2^m(2n + 1)$ if $m$ and $n$ exist, and since every even number contains a factor that is odd (for powers of two, we consider the factor one), there is always a $m$ and $n$ that satisfies the equality. Therefore, for any $x \in \omega$ , there is always a $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m, n) = 2^m(2n + 1) - 1$ and $f$ is surjective. As such, because $f$ is both surjective and injective, $f$ is bijective, and the equation $f(m, n) = 2^m(2n + 1) - 1$ defines a one-to-one correspondence between $\omega \times \omega$ and $\omega$ .","['elementary-set-theory', 'solution-verification']"

3712173,Evaluate the derivative of a function at $x=1$ and find a given limit at $\infty$,"QUESTION: Suppose $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a function given by $$f(x)=e^{(x^{10}−1)}+(x− 1)^2 \sin(\frac{1}{x-1})$$ $(a)$ Find $f'(1)$ . $(b)$ Evaluate $$\lim_{u\to\infty} [100u-u\sum_{k=1}^{100}f(1+\frac{k}u)]$$ MY ANSWER: For the first part I have tried it in two ways, and the second in one.. let me explain what I have done- Method 1/1 $f(x)=e^{(x^{10}-1)}+(x-1)^2\sin(\frac{1}{x-1})$ Therefore, $$f'(x)=10x^9e^{(x^{10}-1)}+(x-1)^2\cos\bigg(\frac{1}{x-1}\bigg)\frac{(-1)}{(x-1)^2}+\sin\bigg(\frac{1}{x-1}\bigg)2(x-1)$$ Now when $x→1$ , since $\sin\theta$ is an oscillating number between $[-1,1]$ therefore $\sin\big(\frac{1}{x-1}\big)2(x-1)$ becomes $0$ . Hence, $$f'(1)=10-\cos(\infty)$$ This is a finite value oscillating between $[9,11]$ but how do I find that? So here I am stuck.. Method 1/2 From the fundamental theorem of calculus $$f'(x)=\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$ Here $a=1$ and substituting $x$ to $1+h$ where $h→0$ we get- $$\lim_{h→0}\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{1+h-1}$$ $$\lim_{h→0}\frac{e^{[(1+h)^{10}-1]}+(1+h-1)^2\sin\bigg(\frac{1}{1+h-1}\bigg)}{h}$$ Now the second part becomes $\frac{h^2\sin(\frac{1}h)}{h}$ which is $\frac{\sin(\frac{1}h)}{\frac{1}h}$ when $h→0$ . Therefore that is clearly $0$ . Coming to the first part we get- $$\frac{e^{\big((1+h)^{10}-1\big)}}{h}$$ Expanding $(1+h)^{10}$ using binomial expansion, we obtain $$(1+h)^{10}= \binom{10}{0}+\binom{10}{1}h+\binom{10}{2}h^2+....$$ From here I cannot take it. The $\binom{10}{0}$ gets cancelled by $1$ , but what will I do with the rest? I did a little further although illegally $:$ P, that since $h→0$ therefore I completely ignored the terms containing $h^2$ or higher powers of $h$ . So we are left with $e^{10h}$ . Expanding this using Taylor expansion (Maclaurin to be precise) we get $$e^{10h}= 1 + 10h+ \frac{(10h)^2}{2!} + \frac{(10h)^3}{3!} +......$$ Since we have an $h$ in the denominator, only $10h$ becomes $10$ and remaining all $0$ except $1$ which becomes $\frac{1}h$ . As you can see, $\frac{1}h$ creates problem here. we remember that we did illegal assumptions, so mathematics always arrests anyway $:$ P Any help in this part? Coming to the second part of the question- Method 2/1 $$\lim_{u→\infty}[100u-u\sum_{k=1}^{100}f\bigg(1+\frac{k}u\bigg)]$$ Let's break this and see it in parts.. second part $$\bigg(1+\frac{k}u-1\bigg)^2\sin\bigg(\frac{1}{1+\frac{k}u-1}\bigg)$$ $$\implies \bigg(\frac{k}u\bigg)^2\sin\bigg(\frac{u}k\bigg)$$ Now when $u→\infty$ this becomes $0$ due to clear reasons stated previously.. So every term of this summation becomes $0$ . first part $$e^{\big((1+\frac{k}u)^{10}-1\big)}$$ When $u→\infty$ this becomes $e^{(1-1)}$ or $e^0$ therefore $1$ . Therefore the summation upto $100$ terms becomes nothing but $100$ . Therefore, our limit becomes $$\lim_{u→\infty}[100u-100u]$$ $$=0$$ Am I correct? If not where is the mistake that I have committed? Any help will be much appreciated. Thank you so much😊.","['limits', 'calculus', 'functions', 'derivatives']"

$$ /!\ I do not require that $P(x)$ is the jacobian of some diffeormorphism. Proposition of Proof: If $Q(x_0)$ is invertible and all its eignevalue are simple, then this property is locally preserved. Hence the basis of orthonormal vectors depend smoothly on the point. If $Q(x_0)$ has a multiple eigenvalue, then locally the eigen hypersurface can split into multiple eigen hypersurfacesof smaller dimension. However because the bilinear form asociated with $Q$ is symmetric the vectors spanning the multiple smaller hypersurfaces will converge to a basis of the eigenhypersurface. Hence the transformation is still smooth. If $det(Q(x_0))=0$ , then locally we have $\mathbb{R}^n=\ker Q \oplus^{\perp}rg(Q)$ . The kernel of $Q$ is determined by a set of equations, by the implicit functions theorem we can express the vector spanning this kernel by smooth functions. As the image of $Q$ is orthogonal to the kernel, then it is also spanned by smooth functions and we can express $Q$ in this subspace and repeat the previous argument.","['smooth-functions', 'real-analysis', 'bilinear-form', 'matrix-calculus', 'differential-geometry']"

3712358,Prove that $\lim_{n \to \infty} a^{\frac{1}{n}} = 1$ when $a > 0$,"The question is in the title. I will present the argument that I have for this. Proof Attempt: Let $a = 1$ . Then, $a^{\frac{1}{n}} = 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ so the limit is clearly equal to 1. Let $a > 1$ . Define $x_n = a^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1$ . Then, we have: $$a = (1+x_n)^n$$ I claim that $x_n > 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . To show that this is true, suppose that $x_n \leq 0$ . Then, $a^{\frac{1}{n}} < 1$ and that implies that $a \leq 1$ . This is false under the given hypothesis that $a > 1$ . Now, we use Bernoulli's inequality and deduce that: $$a = (1+x_n)^n \geq 1+nx_n \geq 1$$ $$\frac{a-1}{n} \geq x_n \geq 0$$ By the Squeeze Theorem, it follows that $x_n \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ . That is, $a^{\frac{1}{n}} \to 1$ as $n \to \infty$ . Suppose that $0 < a < 1$ . Then: $$b = \frac{1}{a} > 1$$ Clearly, the sequence defined by $x_n = b^{\frac{1}{n}}$ converges to 1. So: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} b^{\frac{1}{n}} = 1$$ $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{b^{\frac{1}{n}}} = \frac{1}{\lim_{n \to \infty} b^{\frac{1}{n}}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} a^{\frac{1}{n}} = 1$$ That proves the desired result.

Then $f\circ\pi(\phi^{-1})$ is differentiable and $f\circ\psi^{-1}$ is differentiable. We need to show that $\psi\circ\pi\circ\phi^{-1}$ is differentiable. I don't know how to prove this. Can we say that since $(U,\psi\circ\pi)$ constructs a chart of $X$, by the compatibility, $\psi\circ\pi\circ\phi^{-1}$ is differentiable? This seems true but this does not use the fact that $f$ is differentiable. Sorry I have no background of Differentiable Manifolds. Any help would be appreciated.

We suppose that $n \geq 5$ and that $n$ is not divisible by $2$ nor $3$ . Prove that the following positioning of $n$ children with torches $T_0, T_1, ..., T_{n-1}$ works, i.e no two torches light the same position in the backyard: For $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ we position the torch $T_i$ on the field ( $i, 2i \text{ } \text{mod } n).$ Here, we use the ( $x$ -coordinate, $y$ -coordinate) coordinate system, where $x$ describes the horizontal position, and $y$ the vertical. For example: The three torches in the picture are placed on the fields $(3, 1), (2, n-3)$ and $(n-2, n-2).$ My idea was to prove by contradiction and break up each case on how the torches light up their path (horizontally, vertically and diagonally), but I can't see what follows.

If that's the case we would have that $a_n$ is even and since $2-\sqrt5 < 1 \Rightarrow (2-\sqrt5)^n < 1 \Rightarrow$ $(2+\sqrt5)^n +(2-\sqrt5)^n = \lfloor (2+\sqrt5)^{2019} \rfloor$ this would imply that $\lfloor (2+\sqrt5)^{2019} \rfloor$ is even as well and hence not a prime.

3713206,Question about Spivak's proof of how to use u-substitution when the derivative of the inner function does not appear in the integral,"Spivak (3rd edition) proposes solving the integral $$\int \frac{1+e^x}{1-e^x} dx$$ by letting $u=e^x$ , $x=\ln(u)$ , and $dx=\frac{1}{u}du$ . This results in the integral $$\int \frac{1+u}{1-u}\frac{1}{u}du\\=\int \frac{2}{1-u}+\frac{1}{u}du=-2\ln(1-u)+\ln(u)=-2\ln(1-e^x)+x$$ From this example, Spivak argues that a similar method will work on any integral of the form $\int f(g(x))dx$ whenever $g(x)$ is invertible in the appropriate interval. Because this method is not a simple application of the substitution theorem, Spivak provides the following justification for his claim. Consider continuous $f$ and $g$ where $g$ is invertible on the appropriate interval. Applying the above  method to the arbitrary case, we let $u=g(x)$ , $x=g^{−1}(u)$ , and $dx=(g^{−1})′(u)du$ . Thus, we need to show that $$∫f(g(x))dx=∫f(u)(g^{−1})′(u)du$$ To prove this equality Spivak uses a more typical substitution $u=g(x)$ , $du=g′(x)dx$ and applies it by noting that $$∫f(g(x))dx=∫f(g(x))g′(x)\frac{1}{g′(x)}dx$$ Presumably using the substitution theorem, which roughly states that $∫f(g(x))g'(x)dx=∫f(u)du$ , Spivak asserts that $$∫f(g(x))g′(x)\frac{1}{g′(x)}dx=∫f(u)\frac{1}{g′(g^{−1}(u))}du$$ Then, because $(g^{-1})'(u)=\frac{1}{g'(g^{-1}(u))}$ Spivak concludes $$∫f(u)\frac{1}{g′(g^{−1}(u))}du=∫f(u)(g^{−1})′(u)du$$ I lose track of the argument when Spivak argues that $$∫f(g(x))g′(x)\frac{1}{g′(x)}dx=∫f(u)\frac{1}{g′(g^{−1}(u))}du$$ In the original example, it was clear to me how we could apply the substitution theorem to make this equality true because $\frac{1}{g'(x)}$ was in fact a function of $g(x)$ as $g'(x)=g(x)$ . But this is not necessarily true in all cases, or so it seems. How do we know that $f(g(x))\frac{1}{g'x}$ can be written in the form $h(g(x))$ for some continuous function $h$ ? To sum up, my main questions is, how do we use the substitution theorem to justify the equality $$∫f(g(x))g′(x)\frac{1}{g′(x)}dx=∫f(u)\frac{1}{g′(g^{−1}(u))}du$$","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"

Here are my thoughts on this problem: if we could take the Fourier transform of the above equation, we get $$\left(e^{iak}+e^{ibk}\right)\hat f(k) = \frac{1}{4}\hat f(k/2)$$ $$\Rightarrow |\hat f(k)| = \frac{|\hat f(k/2)|}{8|\cos\left(k\cdot(a-b)/2\right)|}.$$ Applying the above recursively, we see $\hat f(k) = 0$ for all $k$ except when $\cos\left(k\cdot (a-b)/2^n\right) = 0$ , some $n$ . This looks like the spectrum of a periodic function with period $2|a-b|$ . This makes sense but it is far from an actual proof.

3713668,Is a 99% confidence level more precise than 95%?,"Hi.
I'm confused by 'significance level'.
If significance level is lower, is the result of test more reliable? I think it's the opposite, so it makes me so confused. Look at the picture and assume that $H_0$ is null hypothesis, $\alpha$ is the 'significance level'.
Let's test this, by sample size is 40, as a result sample mean is $\mu_1$ .
If the given 'confidence level'( $1-\alpha$ ) is 95%, z value of 'c' would be 1.96. 
If given 99%, 'c' would be 2.56 Here is the problem.
If confidence level is 99%, is the result more reliable than confidence level 95%?
If c level is 99%, more error would be included in null hypothesis area, than level 95%.
if c level is 99%, it means '99% of deviation would be regarded as in the null area anyway. So actually, c level 99% means it's less precise than 95%, right?
Rather, if confidence level is very small like 5%, so the 'c' value goes closer to $\mu_0$ , it would mean that we will regard more values to be error. So it must be more precise. Am I wrong? The textbook seems to say i'm wrong. And hope you genius explain it..

Proof of (ii): By (i), every power $g^m$ of $g$ is equal to one of the $n$ elements $e,g,...,g^{n-1}$ .No two of these elements are equal, for if $0\le j<i\le n-1$ are such that $g^i=g^j$ then $0<i-j<n$ and $g^{i-j}=e$ , contradicting the definition of the order of $g$ . Thus, $\langle g\rangle={e,g,...,g^{n-1}}$ has order $n$ . My problem is I literally don't understand this proof. First statement is bit cryptic for me what does ""every power $g^m$ "" of $g$ "" actually means? Does it mean $g^{m+1}$ or $g$ with power $m$ ? Well if it is $g$ with power $m$ then this statement is might be true since $0\le r<n$ so there might exist $g^r$ such that $g^m$ equal to it .

This motivates the following question: If $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ is a measure space and $f \colon X \to \mathbb{C}$ is measurable, do there exist measurable functions $r \colon X \to [0, \infty)$ (note that $r$ is allowed to be 0) and $\varphi \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ so that $$f(x) = r(x)(\cos(\varphi(x)) + i \sin(\varphi(x)))$$ I know that $\varphi$ (if existent) certainly will not be unique and that $r$ can indeed be found quite easily by $$r(x) = |f(x)|$$ So the main struggle is with finding $\varphi$ . Can we prove that there always exists such a measurable $\varphi$ ? Edit: As pointed out in the comments, the statement holds for simple functions $f = \sum \alpha_k \chi_{A_k}$ , by simply setting $r = |f|$ and $\varphi = \sum \varphi_k \chi_{A_k}$ , where the $\varphi_k \in \mathbb{R}$ are chosen such that $f(x) = r(x) \exp(i\varphi_k)$ , since then by construction $$f = r \cdot \exp(i\varphi)$$ Now it is clear, that if we have an arbitrary measurable function $f$ , then we can approximate $f$ by simple function, thus by what we have seen before, we may find a sequence of simple functions $\{\varphi_n\}$ such that $$r(x)\exp(i\varphi_n(x)) \to f(x)$$ for all $x \in X$ . However, this does not guarantee, that there exists some $\varphi \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ so that $\varphi_n(x) \to \varphi(x)$ and $r(x)\exp(i\varphi(x)) = f(x)$ for all $x$ .","['measure-theory', 'polar-coordinates']"

3714053,Does localisation of a faithful retraction induce an isomorphism between adjointables of Hilbert modules?,"The title is quite a mouthful, so let me develop some context. All of this is from the book on Hilbert Modules by C. Lance. If $A$ is a $C^*$ -algebra, $M(A)$ its multiplier algebra and $B$ a sub-algebra of $M(A)$ then a positive linear map $\tau: A\to B$ is called a retraction if: For all $a\in A, b\in B$ : $\tau(ab)= \tau(a)b$ $\tau(A)$ is dense in $B$ relative to the strict topology. There is an approximate identity $e_\alpha$ in $A$ so that $\tau(e_\alpha)$ converges to a projection in $B$ . A retraction is additionally called faithful if $\tau(a)>0$ for all positive $a>0$ in $A$ . If $E$ is a Hilbert $A$ -module and $\tau: A\to B$ is a faithful retraction one can also give $E$ the structure of a Hilbert $B$ module via: $$x\cdot b := \lim_\alpha x\cdot e_\alpha \cdot b,\qquad \langle x,y\rangle_\tau := \tau(\langle x,y\rangle) \quad\text{for all $x,y\in E$, $b\in B$}.$$ Any adjointable map (wrt $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle$ ) $t:E\to E$ is also adjointable wrt $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_\tau$ , giving a $*$ -morphism $$\pi_\tau:\mathcal L_A(E, \langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle)\to \mathcal L_B(E, \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_\tau),$$ $\pi_\tau$ is called the localisation of $\tau$ . In the above case of a faithful retraction this map is clearly injective. On page 58 of his book Lance remarks without comment that it is actually an isomorphism. Is the localisation $\pi_\tau$ also surjective for faithful $\tau$ ? I think a simple (finite dimensional) counter-example is possible, but the above book is quite well regarded and it would be strange to have such an error, so I do not trust my counter-example.","['c-star-algebras', 'hilbert-modules', 'operator-algebras', 'operator-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

3714328,Why do absorbing Markov chains appear to violate the law of total expectation?,"Following up on two previous questions: Expected number of steps for reaching a specific absorbing state in an absorbing Markov chain and Expected time till absorption in specific state of a Markov chain Suppose you have an absorbing Markov chain with two absorbing states. You can calculate the probability of reaching either absorbing state, you can calculate the expected number of steps before being absorbed, you can construct a conditional matrix that removes an absorbing state, and you can calculate expected step count for that. For example, consider a minimal drunkard's walk with four states, A, B, C, and D, where A and D are absorbing. We have $$
P = \begin{bmatrix}0 && 0.5 && 0.5 && 0 \\ 0.5 && 0 && 0 && 0.5 \\ 0 && 0 && 1 && 0 \\ 0 && 0 && 0 && 1 \end{bmatrix}, N = \begin{bmatrix}4/3 && 2/3 \\ 2/3 && 4/3\end{bmatrix}, NR = \begin{bmatrix}2/3 && 1/3 \\ 1/3 && 2/3\end{bmatrix} 
$$ Or if we eliminate column three $$
P = \begin{bmatrix}0 && 1 && 0 \\ 0.5 && 0 && 0.5 \\ 0 && 0 && 1 \end{bmatrix}, N = \begin{bmatrix}2&&2\\1&&2\end{bmatrix}, NR = \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix} 
$$ Skipping some of the other math, we eventually get P(reach A from B) = 2/3, P(reach D from B) = 1/3, E(steps starting from B) = 2, E(steps starting from B|end in A) = 3, and E(steps starting from B|end in D) = 4. But 2/3 * 3 + 1/3 * 4 is an expected 10/3 steps, not the 2 from the unconditional matrix. Is there something wrong about the conditional matrix logic? Or else why does this appear to violate the law of total expectation?","['statistics', 'markov-chains', 'probability']"

Specifically, I am wondering if $v\in H^m(\mathbb{R})$ with $m\geq s$ or $m\leq s$ ?. Is there any example of $u(x)$ such that $v(x)\notin H^s(\mathbb{R})$ ?

3714413,Making a vector field divergence-free,"I have a feeling that this is not true, but I'm not sure how to construct a counter-example. Given a non-vanishing smooth vector field $X$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ , is there a positive smooth function $f$ such that the re-scaled vector field $fX$ is divergence-free? This involves solving the following PDE for $f$ , with coefficients depending on $X$ and its first derivatives: $$df(X) + f\text{div}(X) = 0.$$","['partial-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry', 'real-analysis']"

3714425,Euler-Lagrange-type equation for a more natural variational problem,"In mechanics, the application of Euler Lagrange equations always feels a bit odd to me as they are a necessary condition on extrema of functionals on trajectories with fixed endpoints. This is weird as there seems to be no reason to fix endpoints. I would propose the following as a more natural variational problem: Minimize $\int_a^b \mathscr{L}(t, x(t), x'(t))\, dt$ subject to $x(a) = x_0$ , $x'(a) = v_0$ . Hopefully we still get the Euler Lagrange equation as a necessary condition in this case, but I don't know of a proof. Can anyone give a literature reference or prove/disprove the conjecture that we get the Euler Lagrange equation?","['functional-analysis', 'mathematical-physics', 'calculus-of-variations']"

3714516,Extension of a map holomorphic on the unit disk to map holomorphic on the complex plane,"I want to prove a statement regarding the holomorphic extension of a function holomorphic on the unit disk. Let $D \subset \mathbb{C}$ be the (open) unit disk and $f: \bar{D} \to
> \mathbb{C}$ be a continous map, such that $f$ restricted to $D$ is
  holomorphic and $|f(z)|=1$ for all $z \in \partial D$ . Show that $f$ can be extended to a function holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$ up to
  finitely many isolated singularities, i.e. there are finitely many
  points $z_1,..., z_n \in \mathbb{C}$ and a holomorphic function $g:
 \mathbb{C} \setminus \{z_1,...,z_n \} \to \mathbb{C}$ such that $f=g$ on $D$ . Let $C_0=\partial D$ . Then $C_0$ is the unit circle. Consider $f|_D: D \to \mathbb{C}$ . Then $f|_D$ is holomorphic because $f$ is holomorphic. Let $K \subset C_0$ be a circular arc. Because $|f(z)|=1 $ for all $z \in \partial D$ it follows $f(K) \subset C_0$ . Let $\sigma_0$ be the inversion with respect to $C_0$ . Consider \begin{align*}
g: D \cup K \cup \sigma_0(D),  \ F(z)=\begin{cases}
f(z)                       & , \ z \in D          \\
\sigma_0(f(\sigma_0(z)))   & , \ z \in \sigma_0(G) \\
\sigma_0(f(\sigma_0(z)))   & , \ z \in K    
\end{cases}
\end{align*} Then $f(z)=\sigma_0(f(\sigma_0(z)))$ for all $z \in K$ . Because $f|_D$ can be extended to a function that is conitnous on $\bar{D}$ it follows from the Schwarz reflection principle that the function $g$ is holomorphic. The function $g$ has a singularity at $a \in \mathbb{C}$ if and only if $a\in \sigma_0(G)$ and $f(\sigma_0(a))=0$ . Define $S:=\{z \in \sigma_0(D) \ | \ f(\sigma_0(z))=0 \}$ . Then $S$ is the set of singularities of $g$ . Suppose that $S$ contains infinitely many elements. Because $\sigma_0$ is bijective it follows that there are infinitely many elements $z \in D$ such that $f(z)=0$ . Thus $f$ has infinitely many zeros. For every zero of order $m \geq 1$ there is a neighborhood and a holomorphic function $h$ such that $f(z)=(h(z))^m$ in that neighborhood. But I do not see how to proceed.",['complex-analysis']
