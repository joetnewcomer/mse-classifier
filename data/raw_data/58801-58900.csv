649727,Proving that a set is/is not semilinear,"A subset $X$ of $\mathbb{N}^n$ is linear if it is in the form: $u_0 + \langle u_1,...,u_m \rangle = \{ u_0 + t_1 u_1 + ... + t_m u_m \mid t_1,...,t_n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ for some $u_0,...,u_m \in \mathbb{N}^n$ $X$ is semilinear if it is the union of finitely many linear subsets. What are the techniques used to prove that a set is not semilinear (or is semilinear)?

649765,Search for a good analogy in the real world for the mathematical concept of set,"I looked for a good explanation of a set for a course. Therefore I want to find a good analogy of this concept in real life. First I thought of explaining the set as something like a container such as a box. But a box has an identity regardless of its content, i.e. the box stays the same if its content changes. In contrast the identity of a set depends highly on its elements. If you add an object to a set you get a new one. Second thoughts were something like a school class or a band. But also a school class remains the same if a new pupil joins the class during the year and band members can change. Do you know a good analogy of a set in real life – some kind of collection which changes (or we think of it as to be a new collection) if its elements changes?

Find a right inverse of $f$. The answer that I came up to this question was this: $$f(g(x)) = x$$

Since the definition of a function is that each $x$ maps to only 1 $y$, if $x = -1$ then there are potentially 2 $y$ that it could map to: $1$ and $0$. So is this therefore not a function?

0<\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}<\infty~~~~~~~~~\text{and}~~~~~~~~~~~\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}=\left(\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\right)^{-1}
$$ Hello! Here's what I've already tried. (1) From $\mu\ll\nu\ll\eta$ it follows $\mu\ll\eta$ and from this by Radon-Nikodým, that it exists a density $\frac{d\mu}{d\eta}$ of $\mu$ relating to $\eta$, that is $\eta-\text{ a.s.}$ unique. Moreover, there is a second density of $\mu$ relating to $\eta$, getting by using $\mu\ll\nu$ and $\nu\ll\eta$ and again Radon-Nikodým: It exists a density $\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}$, that is $\nu-\text{ a.s.}$ unique and for which it is $\mu=\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}\nu$. Similarly, there exists a density $\frac{d\nu}{d\eta}$, that is $\eta-\text{ f.s.}$ unique and for which it is $\nu=\frac{d\nu}{d\eta}\eta$. Putting this together, it is $$
\mu=\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}\nu=\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}\frac{d\nu}{d\eta}\eta.
$$ So another density of $\mu$ relating to $\eta$ is found.
But because, as said, by Radon-Nikodým the densitiy of $\mu$ relating to $\eta$ (named above $\frac{d\mu}{d\eta}$) is $\eta-\text{ a.s.}$ unique, it follows $$ 
\frac{d\mu}{d\eta}=\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}\frac{d\nu}{d\eta}~\eta-\text{ a.s.}
$$ (2) From $\mu\sim\nu$ it follows by Radon-Nikodým: $\mu=\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}\nu$, whereat $\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}$ is $\nu-\text{ a.s.}$ unique $\nu=\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\mu$, whereat $\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}$ is $\mu-\text{ a.s.}$ unique $$
\implies \nu=\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\mu=\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}\nu
$$ Additionally, it is $\nu\ll\nu$ and $\nu=f\nu$ with $f\equiv 1$. From the $\mu-\text{ a.s.}$-uniqueness of the density of $\nu$ relating to $\nu$ it follows $$
\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}=1~\nu-\text{ a.s.}
$$ Finally it is
$$
\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}=1~\nu-\text{ a.s.}\Leftrightarrow \frac{d\mu}{d\nu}=\left(\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\right)^{-1}~\nu-\text{ a.s.}.
$$ It remains to show, that
$$
0<\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}<\infty~\mu-\text{ a.s.}\text{ resp. }\nu-\text{ a.s}

650145,Difference between various type of bundles having a group as fibre,"I am trying to understand the difference between these three objects: 1- a fiber bundle in which the fiber is a group $G$ 2- a fiber bundle in which the fiber is a group $G$ and the structure group is also $G$ 3- a principal $G$-bundle Denote by $\{U_i,\phi_i \}$ a local trivialization of the bundle and consider the transition function $\phi_i\circ\phi^{-1}_j:U_i\cap U_j\times G\rightarrow U_i\cap U_j\times G$, $\phi_i\circ\phi^{-1}_j(x,g)=(x,t_{ij}(x,g))$, with $t_{ij}(x,\cdot):G\rightarrow G$ a diffeomorphism. 
As far as I have understood, the difference between 1 and 2 is that in 1 the transition functions need not to be a left $G$-action, while in 2. they need to, i.e.~I can write $t_{ij}(x,g)=\rho(\tau_{ij}(x),g)$, with $\tau_{ij}:U_i\cap U_j\rightarrow G $ and $\rho: G\times G \rightarrow G$ a left action of $G$ on itself. The difference between 2 and 3 is that while in 2 any action will do, in 3 the action must be left multiplication. As a consequence only in 3 it is possible to globally define a right action of $G$ on the total space of the bundle. Is all of this correct? To better understand the theory I am trying to think of some examples. Let us consider bundles over $S^1$ with fiber $S^1$ (which can be thought as the group $U(1)$). Cover $S^1$ with two open sets $U_1=\{\exp(ix):-\epsilon<x<\pi+\epsilon\}$, $U_2=\{\exp(ix):\pi-\epsilon<x<2\pi+\epsilon\}$. The overlap consist of two open sets. Let us take the identity as transition functions over one of them and consider transition functions over the other, $t:V\rightarrow G$ with $V=\{\exp(ix):-\epsilon<x<\epsilon\}$. As an example of 1 I thought of taking $t(x,g)=g^{-1}$, which is not an action of the fiber on itself (basically it is mapping each point on the fibre to its conjugate). By the way is this the Klein bottle? An example of 2 but not 3 would be to take $t(x,g)=\rho(\tau(x),g)$ with $\tau(x)=\exp(ix)$ and $\rho(\exp(ix),g)=\exp(2ix)g$. (I am not sure about this one because defining instead $\tau(x)=\exp(2ix)$, $\rho$ left translation the map $t$ that one obtains is identical) 
In the non-Abelian case another example would be to take $\tau(x)=h\in G$ and $\rho(h,g)=hgh^{-1}$. Finally an example of 3 would be given by $\tau(x)=\exp(ix)$ and $\rho$ left multiplication. Again, is what I wrote correct? Thanks for the help and sorry for the long question!","['fiber-bundles', 'principal-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

650160,Identifying the stalk of the general point of an integral scheme with the field of fractions of any open affine,"Let $X$ be an integral scheme and $\eta$ its general point. Then we can identify $\mathcal O_{X,\eta}$ with $FF(A)$ where $\operatorname{Spec} A$ is any open affine of $X$, because $\eta$ lives in all open affines. But how can we then extend any $f \in FF(A)$ to a function on the whole of $X$, i.e. to an element of $\mathcal O_{X,\eta}$? I am not sure how to realize this algebraically because I don't know in what form I should write $\mathcal O_{X,\eta}$. When I think about it geometrically, at least I know that I am not extending $f$ to something bigger than the closure of $\operatorname{Spec} A$ because $X$ is irreducible. But does it really suffice that I am not extending a function outside the closure of its domain? Can I always extend a function to the closure of its domain of definition in algebraic geometry? (here I mean function in the sense of an element of the sheaf of rings, not as a function that should always have a non ""1/0 value"") I worked this out for the $\Bbb P^n$ and at least I got the same answers. For $X=\Bbb P^n$, the general point $\eta$ is just the zero ideal in $k[x_0,...,x_n]$. So we get $\mathcal O_{X,\eta} = k(x_0,...,x_n)_0 \cong k(x_1,x_2,...x_n)$ by the dehomogenizing map $-$quotient out by $(x_0-1)$. On the other hand, if we take some affine open $\operatorname {Spec} A$ such that $A =k[x_0/x_0,x_1/x_0...,x_n/x_0]/(x_0/x_0-1)$, we also get $\eta = (0)$ and $\mathcal O_{\operatorname{Spec} A,\eta} = k(x_1/x_0,x_2/x_0,...,x_n/x_0)$.",['algebraic-geometry']

Show $f$ is not bounded. I've seen a proof which can be summarized: $$\forall \varepsilon  > 0\exists M.\forall x > M:\left| {f'(x) - L} \right| < \varepsilon $$ Particularly, 
$L-1 < f'(x) < L+1$ where $\varepsilon=1$. We argue by contradiction $f$ is bounded. Therefore, there are $M,n$ which are maximum and minimum values of $f$, respectively. Defining: $A=M-m>0$. At this point, we know that $\forall x>x_0: f'(x)>L-1$. Let us choose $x_1>x_0$, such that: $$x_1-x_0 > {A \over L-1}$$ Long story short, if you use Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem you will find that: $$\left| {f({x_1}) - f({x_0})} \right| > A = m - n$$ A contradiction, which implies $f$ is not bounded as requested. Well, After reading the proof couple of times I think I get the intention. To show $f$ is not bounded we'd like to use (by contradiction) maximum and minimum. What is bothering me is the definition of $x_1-x_0 > {A \over L-1}$. Sure, it did the work as you can see, but how can one think of choosing this inequality? I mean, what does it represent actually? I'm trying to interpret the meaning of the ratio on the righthand side relative to substraction on the lefthand side. And maybe earlier question, why choosing $\varepsilon=1$?

650278,Determine a sequence of random variables is a martingale,"I'm trying to solve a problem from an old exam. This is an easy but a bit lengthy exercise, divided into subproblems. Since they are based on each other and probably are quite short, I was hoping that this will be accepted. Any comments on what I've done so far would be appreciated. For the completely unsolved I would be more than satisfied with the basic ideas and perhaps some reference for results that could be needed. Let $(X_n)_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of i.d.d. Bernoulli random
  variables with $\mathbb{P}(X_n = 0) = 1-\mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = 1-p$
  with $p \in [0,1]$. Let $M_n = \sum_{k=1}^n (X_k - p)$ and let
  $\mathcal{F}_n(X_1, \dots, X_n)$. (a) Show that $(M_n)_{n\geq 1}$ is a martingale. In order for $(M_n)$ to be a martingale, we need the following three properties. $M_n \in \mathcal{F}_n$ for all $n \geq 1$ $M_n \in \mathcal{L}^{1}(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ for all $n \geq 1$ $\mathbb{E}[M_{n+1} | \mathcal{F}_n] = M_n$ a.s. Starting with 1. By construction, $X_k \in \mathcal{F}_k \subset \mathcal{F}_n$ for all $k \leq n$, so it is trivial that $M_n = \sum_{k=1}^n (X_k-p) \in \mathcal{F}_n$. Turning to 2. First observe that $\mathbb{E}X_n = p$ for all $n$. By the linearity and subadditivity of the expectation, we have that $$ \mathbb{E}|M_n| = \left|\sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E}(X_k-p)\right| \leq \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E}|X_k -p|\leq np + \sum_{n=1}^n \mathbb{E}X_k = 2np. $$ Hence $M_n$ is bounded in $\mathcal{L}^1$ for every $n$. Now 3. Using the fact that $\sigma(X_{n+1})$ and $\sigma(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ are independent, we get $$\mathbb{E}[M_{n+1}-M_n | \mathcal{F}_n] = \mathbb{E}[X_{n+1}-p | \mathcal{F}_n] = \mathbb{E}[X_{n+1}]-p =0$$ and hence $(M_n)$ have the martingale property. Let $\widetilde{M}$ be another martingale adapted to the filtration
  and $m = \mathbb{E} \widetilde{M}_1$. Since $\widetilde{M}$ is
  adapted, it is known that there exist functions $f_n$ such that
  $\widetilde{M}_n = f_n(X_1, \dots, X_n)$. (b) Show that the $f_n$ obey the backward recursion
$$f_n(x_1, \dots, x_n) = (1-p)f_{n+1}(x_1, \dots, x_n, 0) + pf_{n+1}(x_1, \dots, x_n, 1), $$
for $x_i \in \{0,1\}$. I'm not sure how to do this. If I understand it correctly, combining the properties that $\widetilde{M}_n = f_n(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ and $\widetilde{M}_n \overset{a.s.}{=} \mathbb{E}[\widetilde{M}_{n+1}|\mathcal{F}_n]$, we have for any $x_i$ with $1 \leq i \leq n$, that $$f_n(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \mathbb{E}[f_n(x_1, \dots, x_n, X_{n+1}) | \mathcal{F}_n] = \mathbb{E}[f_{n+1}(x_1, \dots, x_n, X_{n+1}] {=} \mathbb{P}(X_{n+1}=0)f_{n+1}(x_1, \dots, x_n, 0) + \mathbb{P}(X_{n+1}=1)f_{n+1}(x_1, \dots, x_n, 1)
= (1-p)f_{n+1}(x_1, \dots, x_n, 0) + pf_{n+1}(x_1, \dots, x_n, 1).$$ (c) Let $Y_n = f_{n}(X_1, \dots, X_{n-1}, 1) - f_{n}(X_1, \dots, X_{n-1}, 0)$. Show that $\widetilde{M}_n = m + (Y \cdot M)_n$, that is, 
$$\widetilde{M}_n = m +\sum_{k=1}^nY_k(X_k -p).$$ I assume that $f_0 = 0$. Then $$\tilde{M}_n = f_n - f_0 = \sum_{j=1}^{n}(f_{j}-f_{j-1})$$.
Furthermore, $$f_j(X_1, \dots, X_{j}) - f_{j-1}(X_1, \dots, X_{j-1}) = f_j(X_1, \dots, X_{j})-(1-p)f_j(X_1, \dots, X_{j-1},0)-pf_j(X_1, \dots, X_{j-1},1) = [f_j(X_1, \dots, X_{j})-f_{j}(X_1, \dots, X_{j-1},0)]-p[f_j(X_1, \dots, X_{j-1},1)-f_j(X_1, \dots, X_{j-1},0)]$$. Here I got stuck again. Is is right so far, and if, how should I complete this? I am also not entirely sure why we get the equation $f_{j+1}-f_j = a_jX_{j+1}+b_j$. (d) Let $\widetilde{M}_n = (pe+1-p)^{-n}\text{exp}(\sum_{i=1}^nX_i), n\geq0$. Show that $\widetilde{M}$ is a martingale and that
$$Y_n = \frac{e-1}{pe+1-p}\widetilde{M}_{n-1}$$ We have that $\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \in \mathcal{F}_n$ for all $n\geq0$. Since exp is measurable, $\text{exp}(\sum_{i=1}^nX_i) \in \mathcal{F}_n$ and we can multiply with a constant. To show that $\tilde{M}_n \in \mathcal{L}^1$, we observe that $$\mathbb{E}|\tilde{M}_n| = \mathbb{E}[\tilde{M}_n]=(pe+1-p)^{-n}\mathbb{E}[e^{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}] = (pe+1-p)^{-n}\mathbb{E}[e^{X_i}]^n = 1$$. It remains to show that $(\tilde{M})$ has the martingale property. A computation shows that $$\mathbb{E}[\tilde{M}_{n+1}|\mathcal{F}_n] = (pe+1-p)^{-n-1}\mathbb{E}[e^{X_{n+1}}e^{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}|\mathcal{F_n}]\overset{(*)}{=} e^{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}(pe+1-p)^{n-1}\mathbb{E}[e^{X_{n+1}}]=(pe+1-p)^{-1}e^{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i} = \tilde{M}_n \text{ (a.s.)}$$. Why is ($*$) justified? That is, why we can factor out $e^{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}$ from the conditional expectation. The second part was just as told a matter of computation, $$\frac{(e-1)}{pe+1-p}\tilde{M}_{n-1} = \frac{(e-1)}{(pe+1-e)^n}e^{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i} = (pe+1-p)^{-n}(e^{1+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}X_i} + e^{0+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}X_i})= f(X_1, \dots, X_{n-1}, 1) - f(X_1, \dots, X_{n-1},0) = Y_n.$$ And again, if this too much for a single question, please let me know and I will edit it. Keep in mind that I'm not specifically asking for solutions but rather be pointed in the right direction.","['probability-theory', 'martingales']"
650291,Having trouble with a combinatorics question.,"I'm not so good at combinatorics, but I want to know if my answer for this question is right.

And here's a translation made by me: A collection of 30 balls is available, separated in 5 different sizes and 6 different  colors in a way that in each size there are six colors. How many collections  of 4 balls have exactly 2 pairs of balls of same size (which those 4 balls aren't of same size)? I first wrote this table: \begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
\cdot & Size 1 & Size 2 & Size 3 & Size 4 & Size 5 \\ 
\hline
Color 1 & ① & ❶ & ⒈ & ⑴ & ⓵ \\ 
Color 2 & ② & ❷ & ⒉ & ⑵ & ⓶ \\ 
Color 3 & ③ & ❸ & ⒊ & ⑶ & ⓷ \\ 
Color 4 & ④ & ❹ & ⒋ & ⑷ & ⓸ \\
Color 5 & ⑤ & ❺ & ⒌ & ⑸ & ⓹ \\
Color 6 & ⑥ & ❻ & ⒍ & ⑹ & ⓺
\end{array} So, an example of a collection of 4 balls that have exactly 2 pairs of balls of the same size is: ①②❶❷ So, for the first column (Size 1) there are 15 combinations of having 2 balls: ①②  ②③  ③④  ④⑤  ⑤⑥
①③  ②④  ③⑤  ④⑥
①④  ②⑤  ③⑥
①⑤  ②⑥
①⑥ Which is the same as: $$C_{6}^{2} = \frac{6!}{(6-2)!2!} = 15$$ Or the same as: $$\sum_{k=1}^{5}k = 15$$ Then, for each row we have 10 combinations: ①❶   ❶⒈  ⒈⑴  ⑴⓵
①⒈  ❶⑴  ⒈⓵
①⑴  ❶⓵  
①⓵ Which is the same as: $$C_{5}^{2} = \frac{5!}{(5-2)!2!} = 10$$ Or the same as: $$\sum_{k=1}^{4}k = 10$$ And so, by the rule of product I say that the number of collections of 4 balls having exactly 2 pairs of the same size is: $$C_{6}^{2} C_{5}^{2} = 150$$ I'll be grateful if someone check my answer and give me further details :D",['combinatorics']

650456,Why is it important to study the eigenvalues of the Laplacian?,"Why is it important to study the eigenvalues of the Laplacian acting on regions in $\mathbb R^n$? What information does this give us? What problems does this information help us solve? In particular, if $0$ is in the spectrum, does this tell us anything about the solvability of the Dirichlet or Poisson problem for the region? This second question is motivated by the following theorem that I found while flipping through Davies' Spectral Theory and Differential Operators . From the emphasis he puts on it and the amount of work he did to prove it, I feel it must be important, but I can't say why. Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^2$ be regular, and let $H$ be the
  Friedrichs extension of $\small -\triangle$ initially defined on
  $C^\infty_c(\Omega)$. Then $0\in \operatorname{Spec} H$ if and only if

650513,"Computing $\int_{0}^{\pi}\ln\left(1-2a\cos x+a^2\right) \, dx$","For $a\ge 0$ let's define $$I(a)=\int_{0}^{\pi}\ln\left(1-2a\cos x+a^2\right)dx.$$ Find explicit formula for $I(a)$. My attempt: Let $$\begin{align*}
f_n(x)
&= \frac{\ln\left(1-2
\left(a+\frac{1}{n}\right)\cos x+\left(a+\frac{1}{n}\right)^2\right)-\ln\left(1-2a\cos x+a^2\right)}{\frac{1}{n}}\\
&=\frac{\ln\left(\displaystyle\frac{1-2

\end{align*}$$
Now it is easy to see that $f_n(x) \to \frac{2a-2\cos x}{1-2a\cos x+a^2}$ as $n \to \infty$. $|f_n(x)|\le \frac{2a+2}{(1-a)^2}$ RHS is integrable so $\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_0^\pi f_n(x)dx = \int_0^\pi \frac{2a-2\cos x}{1-2a\cos x+a^2} dx=I'(a)$. But 
$$\int_0^\pi \frac{2a-2\cos x}{1-2a\cos x+a^2}=\int_0^\pi\left(1-\frac{(1-a)^2}{1-2a\cos x+a^2}\right)dx.$$ Consider
$$\int_0^\pi\frac{dx}{1-2a\cos x+a^2}=\int_0^\infty\frac{\frac{dy}{1+t^2}}{1-2a\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}+a^2}=\int_0^\infty\frac{dt}{1+t^2-2a(1-t^2)+a^2(1+t^2)}=\int_0^\infty\frac{dt}{(1-a)^2+\left((1+a)t\right)^2}\stackrel{(*)}{=}\frac{1}{(1-a)^2}\int_0^\infty\frac{dt}{1+\left(\frac{1+a}{1-a}t\right)^2}=\frac{1}{(1-a)(1+a)}\int_0^\infty\frac{du}{1+u^2}=\frac{1}{(1-a)(1+a)}\frac{\pi}{2}.$$
So $$I'(a)=\frac{\pi}{2}\left(2-\frac{1-a}{1+a}\right)\Rightarrow I(a)=\frac{\pi}{2}\left(3a-2\ln\left(a+1\right)\right).$$ It looks too easy, is there any crucial lack? $(*)$ — we have to check $a=1$ here by hand and actually consider $[0,1), (1,\infty)$ but result on these two intervals may differ only by constant - it may be important but in my opinion not crucial for this proof.","['calculus', 'integration', 'solution-verification', 'definite-integrals', 'real-analysis']"
650535,Maps $\phi:C^{\infty}(Y) \rightarrow C^{\infty}(X)$ as pullbacks,"I've just begun reading through Joyce's D-manifolds and d-orbifolds: a theory of derived differential geometry , and I've come across a seemingly innocuous statement that isn't quite clear to me.  Specifically, in $\S$ 1.2 he gives the following definition (in my words): A $\mathbf{C^{\infty}}$ -ring is a pair $(\mathfrak{C},\{\Phi_n\}_{n\geq 0})$ where $\mathfrak{C}$ is a set and $\Phi_n:C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)\rightarrow \text{Maps}(\mathfrak{C}^n,\mathfrak{C})$ satisfies (I will drop the subscript $n$ , as no confusion should arise): (i)  For any $m,n\geq 0$ , $\ f_1,\cdots,f_m\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ , and $g\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^m)$ , we can define $h\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ by $$ h(x_1,\cdots,x_n)=g(f_1(x_1,\cdots,x_n),\cdots,f_m(x_1,\cdots,x_n)). $$ Then for any $c_1,\cdots,c_n\in\mathfrak{C}$ , $\Phi$ must satisfy $$ \Phi_h(c_1,\cdots,c_n)=\Phi_g(\Phi_{f_1}(c_1,\cdots,c_n),\cdots,\Phi_{f_m}(c_1,\cdots,c_n)). $$ (ii)  For all $1\leq j\leq n$ , the canonical projection maps $\pi_j:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ must satisfy $$ \Phi_{\pi_j}(c_1,\cdots,c_n)=c_j $$ for all $c_1,\cdots,c_n\in\mathfrak{C}$ . Then there is a straightforward notion of a morphism between these structures: A morphism between $C^{\infty}$ -rings $(\mathfrak{C},\Phi)$ and $(\mathfrak{D},\Psi)$ is a map $\phi:\mathfrak{C}\rightarrow\mathfrak{D}$ such that $$ \begin{array}{ccc} \mathfrak{C}^n & \xrightarrow{\Phi_f} & \mathfrak{C} \\ \downarrow^{\phi^n} & & \downarrow^{\phi} \\ \mathfrak{D}^n & \xrightarrow{\Psi_f} & \mathfrak{D} \end{array}$$ commutes for all $f\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $n\geq 0$ . The basic example, as hinted at by the name of these objects, is $C^{\infty}(X)$ where $X$ is a smooth manifold.  By defining $$ [\Phi_f(c_1,\cdots,c_n)](x)=f(c_1(x),\cdots,c_n(x)) $$ for $f\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ , $c_1,\cdots,c_n\in C^{\infty}(X)$ , and $n\geq 0$ , one clearly gets the structure of a $C^{\infty}$ -ring.  Moreover, for a smooth map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ , the pullback $f^{\ast}:C^{\infty}(Y)\rightarrow C^{\infty}(X)$ is clearly a morphism of $C^{\infty}$ -rings.  But then Joyce goes on to say, Furthermore (at least for $Y$ without boundary), every $C^{\infty}$ -ring morphism $\phi:C^{\infty}(Y)\rightarrow C^{\infty}(X)$ is of the form $\phi=f^{\ast}$ for a unique smooth map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ . My question(s):  Why is this true?  How is the map $f$ constructed?  What about the construction fails if $Y$ has boundary?  Is this statement true regardless of whether or not $\phi$ is a $C^{\infty}$ -ring morphism? The thing that came immediately to mind was defining $f:X\rightarrow Y$ by $$ f(x) = g^{-1}(\phi(g)(x)), $$ so that $f^{\ast}(g)=g(g^{-1}(\phi(g)))=\phi(g)$ , but of course this only works if $g$ is surjective, and the equation $\phi=f^{\ast}$ only holds for this specific $g$ .  I cannot, however, think of any other way of finding $f$ … any suggestions?  References?","['smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
650537,"How does one enumerate $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$, or at least compute $|\mathrm{Aut}(G)|$?","I know that the automorphisms in $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ preserve the order of elements of $G$, so if $G$ is partitioned according to $\mathrm{Ord}$ (order), the product of the cardinalities of the equivalence classes in $G/\mathrm{Ord}$ imposes an upper bound on the number of possible automorphisms of $G$.  (This is so at least for finite $G$.) For example, for $D_{12}$ (the dihedral group of order $12$) I count 1 element  of order 1 7 elements of order 2 2 elements of order 3 2 elements of order 6 So, for $D_{12}$ the product described above is $1\cdot 7\cdot 2\cdot 2 = 28$. But if $G$ is generated by $n < |G|$ elements then I'm tempted to say that only these elements should matter for the argument given above, and therefore, only the equivalence classes for these $n$ elements should appear in the product mentioned above.  Thus, for example, since $D_{12}$ is generated by $n = 2$ elements, one (call it $\alpha$) of order $2$ and one (call it $x$) of order $6$, the product of the cardinalities of their $G/\mathrm{Ord}$ equivalence classes is $7 \cdot 2 = 14$. In any case, $\mathrm{Inn}(G) \lhd \mathrm{Aut}(G)$, and therefore, I expect $|\mathrm{Inn}(D_{12})|$ to be a divisor of $|\mathrm{Aut}(D_{12})|$.  Unfortunately, AFAICT, $|\mathrm{Inn}(D_{12})| = 6$, which is not a divisor of either of the numbers computed above ($28$ or $14$).  (I count that the conjugacy classes of the generators $\alpha$ and $x$ have cardinalities $3$ and $2$, respectively; hence $|\mathrm{Inn}(D_{12})| = 3 \cdot 2 = 6$.) The only way out I can see to avoid a contradiction is to conclude that the number computed by taking the product of cardinalities of classes in $G/\mathrm{Ord}$ provides only an upper bound $|\mathrm{Aut}(G)$.  (I'm not at all convinced by argument, but I'm too tired at the moment to think of a watertight proof or refutation of it.) I have several questions: Where did my reasoning go wrong above? Is there an algorithm for enumerating $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ (or at least for computing $|\mathrm{Aut}(G)|$), at least for finite $G$? I'd be interested in finding about tools/resources to facilitate these computations; they're rather tedious to do by hand.  (Especially in cases where ""pure reasoning"" goes awry, as it did above, it'd be nice to have computational tools for independently confirming one's reasoning.)","['dihedral-groups', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

650588,A random variable with neither probability density function nor probability mass function... is this example wrong?,"This is from Shreve's Stochastic Calculus for Finance II , Appendix A.3. Consider infinitely many independent coin tosses with outcomes $\omega_n$, $n = 1, 2, \dots$ such that $\omega_n$ can be either $H$ = heads or $T$ = tails. Define
\begin{equation}
Y_n\left(\omega\right) = \begin{cases}1 & \text{ if }\omega_n = H \\
0& \text{ if } \omega_n = T\text{.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation} Define $\displaystyle Y = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{2Y_n}{3^{n}}$. Shreve shows that $Y$ can only take values in the Cantor set, and since that particular set has measure zero, its Lebesgue measure is zero as well, thus it does not have a probability density function (since integrating such a density function would give a value of $0$). This part I understand, as well as my professor. Now Shreve claims that $Y$ does not have a probability mass function. If it did, then for some number $x \in C$ [the Cantor set] we would have $\mathbb{P}\left(Y=x\right) > 0$. But $x$ has a unique base-three expansion 
  \begin{equation}
x = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{x_n}{3^{n}}\text{,}
\end{equation}
  where each $x_n$ is either 0, 1, or 2 unless $x$ is of the form $\dfrac{k}{3^{n}}$ for some positive integers $k$ and $n$. In the latter case, $x$ has two base-three expansions... In either case, there at most two choices of $w \in \Omega_{\infty}$ [that is, the infinite coin-toss space] for which $Y(\omega) = x$. In other words, the set $\{\omega \in \Omega; Y(\omega) = x\}$ has either one or two elements. The probability of a set with one element is zero, and the probability of a set with two elements is $0 + 0 = 0$. Hence $\mathbb{P}\left\{Y = x\right\} = 0$. My professor and I were able to follow this until the statement ""The probability of a set with one element is zero."" Is this a true statement? How so? I thought it would be perhaps the fact that the Lebesgue measure of $[a, a] = \{a\}$ is zero, but I don't see any reason why Shreve would only use the Lebesgue measure, since it is not a general probability measure.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'probability']"

650823,On the Grothendieck ring of varieties,"The Grothendieck group of varieties $K_0(\textrm{Var}_k)$ over a field $k$ is the Abelian group generated by isomorphism classes of quasi-projective $k$-varieties, subject to the scissor relation (under which $[Y]=[Z]+[Y\setminus Z]$ for every closed subvariety $Z$ of a variety $Y$). It actually is a ring with product given by $[X]\cdot [Y]=[X\times_k Y]$. I am trying to better understand this ring, and I have some questions on it: How can one prove that the generating set (of isomorphism classes of quasi-projective $k$-varieties) is actually a set and not a proper class? Is $[\emptyset]$ in this ring? It seems to be the only reasonable choice for an (additive) identity element. What is the additive inverse $-[Y]$ of a generator $[Y]\in K_0(\textrm{Var}_k)$? Not every $A\in K_0(\textrm{Var}_k)$ is represented by a variety. How do we write explicitly such an element? I accept any suggestion on how to think about this ring.

650860,To what extent can one imitate holomorphic functions in higher dimensions?,"Let $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be open. Let $f:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic. The last statement about $f$ can be restated as: For every $z_0\in \Omega$, there exists $w\in \mathbb{C}$ such that:
$$\lim_{r\rightarrow 0^+}\sup_{\theta\in[0,2\pi]}\left|\frac{e^{-i\theta}[f(z_0+re^{i\theta})-f(z_0)]}{r}-w\right|=0$$
Now let $V\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ be open and $ f:V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ be a function. We say that $f$ is holomorphic iff for every $\vec{a}\in V$,  there exists $\vec{d}\in\mathbb{R}^3$ such that:
$$\lim_{r\rightarrow 0^+}\sup_{\text{R is a rotation}}\left\|\frac{R^{-1}(f(\vec{a}+rR(\vec e_1))-f(\vec{a}))}{r}-\vec{d}\right\|=0 \tag{1}$$ In $(1)$, $\vec e_1$ denotes the vector $(1,0,0)$. Question: Is my definition for holomorphic functions in 3D a ""good"" one ? For example, does it follow that $f$ is analytic ? Is there a standard name for functions that satisfy $(1)$ ?

That is to say, I would like to compute the expected value of the minimal weight defined as sum of the square of distance. I know that when $n\to\infty,M(n)\to 0$. And in the $1$-dim case, this is easy, since it is only a Poisson process, and the distance between two consecutive points are surely exponential distribution.(Calculation suggests it's about $(n+3)/((n+1)(n+2))$,where $n$ is number of points added) But in the two dimensional case, I got stuck and don't know how to tackle it. This is a problem arouse from the calculation of the cost of a network. Any hint or reference are welcomed, Thanks!

    it is
    $$
(\mu\otimes\lambda)(A_f)=\int_{\Omega}f\, d\mu=\int_0^{\infty}\mu(\left\{f\geq x\right\})\, d\lambda(x).
$$
    Hint for the proof: First show the assumption for elementar functions and approximate any non-negative measurable function by elementar functions from below. Hello! Following the given hint, I first tried to show it for an (non-negative) elementar function, i.e. $f\colon\Omega\to [0,\infty)$ with $f:=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i 1_{A_i}$, whereat $A_i, i=1,\ldots,n\in\mathcal{A}$ pairwise disjoint and $\alpha_i\geq 0$. $$
(\mu\otimes\lambda)(A_f)=\int_{\Omega}\int_{\mathbb{R}}(1_{A_f})_{\omega}(x)\, d\lambda(x)\, d\mu(\omega)=\int_{\Omega}\int_0^{f(\omega)}\, d\lambda(x)\, d\mu(\omega)=\int_{\Omega}\lambda([0,f(\omega)])\, d\mu(\omega)\\=\int_{\Omega}f(\omega)\, d\mu(\omega)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i\mu(A_i)
$$ Now I start from the RHS:
$$
\left\{ f\geq x\right\}=\biguplus_{i=1}^{n}\left\{f=\alpha_i: \alpha_i\geq x\right\}
$$
$$
\implies\int_0^{\infty}\mu(\left\{f\geq x\right\})\, d\lambda(x)=\int_0^{\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mu(\left\{f=\alpha_i: \alpha_i\geq x\right\})\, d\lambda(x)\\=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_{0}^{\infty}\mu(\left\{f=\alpha_i:\alpha_i\geq x\right\})\, d\lambda(x)\\=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_0^{\infty}\int_{\Omega}1_{\left\{f=\alpha_i: \alpha_i\geq x\right\}}(\omega)\, d\mu(\omega)\, d\lambda(x)\\=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_0^{\infty}\int_{\Omega}1_{\left\{f=\alpha_i\right\}}(\omega)1_{x\leq\alpha_i}(x)\, d\mu(\omega)\, d\lambda(x)\\=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_0^{\infty}1_{x\leq\alpha_i}(x)\underbrace{\int_{\Omega}1_{\left\{ f=\alpha_i\right\}}(\omega)}_{=\mu(A_i)}\, d\mu(\omega)\, d\lambda(x)\\=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mu(A_i)\int_0^{\infty}1_{x\leq\alpha_i}(x)\, d\lambda(x)\\=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mu(A_i)\underbrace{\int_0^{\alpha_i}\, d\lambda(x)}_{=\lambda([0,\alpha_i])=\alpha_i}\\=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i\mu(A_i)
$$ So the assumption is shown for an (non-negative) elementar function. Now let $f$ be a non-negative, numerical, measurable function. Then there exists a sequence $(f_n)$ of non-negative elementar functions with $f_n\uparrow f$. Because $A_{f_n}\subset A_{f_{n+1}}$ and $A_{f_n}\uparrow A_f$ it is with the continuity of the measure and Beppo Levi
$$
(\mu\otimes\lambda)(A_f)=\lim_{n\to\infty}(\mu\otimes\lambda)(A_{f_n})=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{\Omega}f_n\, d\mu=\int_{\Omega}f\, d\mu.
$$ Furthermore by Beppo Levi it is $$
\int_{\Omega}f\, d\mu=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{\Omega}f_n\, d\mu\\=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{0}^{\infty}\mu(\left\{f_n\geq x\right\})\, d\lambda(x)
$$ Now the only thing that remains to show is that
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{0}^{\infty}\mu(\left\{f_n\geq x\right\})\, d\lambda(x)=\int_0^{\infty}\mu(\left\{f\geq x\right\})\, d\lambda(x)
$$ Unfortunately, I do not see that. Can you explain that to me? With greetings! math12",['measure-theory']
650875,Every ordered field has a subfield isomorphic to $\mathbb Q$?,"I'm going through the first chapter in a text on real analysis, which contains preliminaries on ordered fields, the real numbers, etc. Supposedly I had learned about such things already, in calculus, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to go over it again. Up until the paragraph which is the subject of my question, everything is thoroughly proven and examples are provided. However the following excerpt just goes through facts, whose proof I cannot conceive: Although $\mathbb Q$ is an archimedean field, these properties cannot be used to define $\mathbb Q$ since $\\$ there are many Archimedean ordered fields. What distinguishes $\mathbb Q$ from the other $\\$Archimedean ordered fields is that $(\mathbb Q,<)$ is the $smallest$ ordered field in the following sense: $\\$ if $(X,\prec)$ is an ordered field, then $X$ contains a sub-field which is (field) isomorphic to $\mathbb Q$.$\\$ Furthermore such an isomorphism preserves the order relation. I've concatenated the paragraph a bit, so the text isn't idem from the book (if anyone wishes to know it's Phillips, An Introduction to Analysis and Integration Theory , Dover Publications). Also $\mathbb Q$ contains no proper subfields, and this can be verified by the apparently easy-to-prove fact that, if a field has characteristic zero, then it contains a subfield isomorphic to $\mathbb Q$. Then it remains to prove the preservation of order. I'm guessing that some concepts from abstract algebra or field theory would easily suffice, but at the moment such topics are a bit over my head, so all I can think of doing is actually constructing the isomorphism $\phi:\mathbb Q\to\hat{\mathbb Q}$, where $\hat{\mathbb Q}$ is a certain subfield of  $X$ in such a way that field operations are preserved, but I really can't come up with anything. So the question is: how do I construct this isomorphism, or, if there's a better way of proving this, how is it done? Thanks for any help.
