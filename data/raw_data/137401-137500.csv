2191593,Is a product of ideals the same as intersection of ideals?,"Let $R$ be a non-trivial commutative unital ring and let $I,J$ be ideals of $R$. The ideal product is defined as $IJ:=\{ i_1j_1+\dots+i_lj_l:l\ge 1, i_n\in I, j_n \in J, n\in\mathbb{N} \}$. Prove that $IJ$ is an ideal of $R$. My approach was to prove that $IJ=I\cap J$, which implies that $IJ$ is an ideal. Let $i\in I\cap J$, then $i\in I, J$, $=i_kj_k$ for some $i_k, j_k\in J$. But $i_kj_k\in IJ$, thus $i\in IJ$. Thus $I\cap J \subset IJ$. For the other direction, I know that it is true, so I will skip the proof thereof. However, I'm not so sure that my proof above is correct since then $P^2=PP=P\cap P = P$, which is not true in general. Can someone please point out what my error could possibly be? Maybe I didn't understand the definition of the product of ideal the way it was to be meant?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'proof-verification', 'ideals']"
2191621,"Is the sequence of functions $f_n(x) = x^n$ uniformly convergent on $[0,1)$?","Is the sequence of functions $f_n(x) = x^n$ uniformly convergent on $[0,1)$? I learned that $f_n(x)$ is not uniformly convergent on $[0,1]$ but what about on $[0,1)$? I think it does converge uniformly to $f(x)=0$ because I can always make $n$ big enough to fit $x^n$ to be within $\epsilon$ from $0$ for any $x$? Or is this not possible? I am not really sure on how to verify a sequence of functions is uniformly convergent on some domain. Also, does uniformly convergent series imply that the series is also absolutely convergent?","['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series']"
2191646,volume of geodesic balls for large Riemannian metrics,"Let $M$ be a smooth compact manifold, let $p\in M$ and let $g_0$ be a fixed Riemannian metric on $M$ . Does there exists a constant $C>0$ such that for any Riemannian metric $g\ge g_0$ , the volume of the geodesic ball with respect to $g$ satisfies $Vol_g(B_g(1,p))\ge C$ ? In other words, can we expect that the volume of these balls does not shrink even after making the Riemannian metric really large? Attempt: All of the results I've researched on this topic involve a fixed Riemannian metric on $M$ and bounding volumes in terms of the injectivity/filling radius. Nothing I've seen so far allows for the Riemannian metric to change as well. I suppose the result has to be true for $\mathbb{S}^1$ because volume is the same as length, so for any large Riemannian metric, any geodesic ball will have a volume of $1$ as long as the volume of $\mathbb{S}^1$ itself is above $1$ .",['differential-geometry']
2191650,"Kernel of $GL(n, \mathbb{Z}) \to GL(n, \mathbb{Z}_{m})$","I need to describe the kernel of the canonical group homomorphism $GL(n, \mathbb{Z}) \to GL(n, \mathbb{Z}_{m})$. Generally speaking, the kernel would be the set of all matrices in $GL(n,\mathbb{Z})$ whose entries along the main diagonal modulo $m$ would equal 1, with all other entries modulo $m$ equaling zero. For example, in the case where $n = 2$, the kernel of this homomorphism would be the set of all $A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$ such that $\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} \mod m = 1 && a_{12} \mod m = 0 \\  a_{21} \mod m = 0 & &a_{22}\mod m = 1 \end{pmatrix}$. Is this all there is to this problem? Or is there something additional that I need to prove? It is an exercise in a section on Ideals and Isomorphism Theorems for Rings, so I thought it was kind of weird that I was able to come up with a solution to this problem that has nothing to do with ideals or ring isomorphisms.

On the one hand, it is easy to rule out many sequences from lying in the intersection: such a sequence cannot be eventually periodic, yet the set of ones in any such sequence must have density $1/2$ in $\mathbb N$. On the other hand, the (topological) support of the measure $P$ with respect to the product topology consists of all binary sequences (since every cylinder set containing a given sequence has positive measure), and one might expect that the support of $P$ is the closure of the intersection of $\mathcal A$.","['general-topology', 'measure-theory', 'cantor-set', 'probability-theory']"

2191713,Associativity of natural join,"A 'relation' is an object with a body that's a set of tuples, and a header that's a set of attribute identifiers. This sort of object is used in the theory of 'relational databases'. A relation is like a table in a spreadsheet, but the collection of columns (""attributes"") is a set, and the collection of rows (""tuples"") is a set. Let relation $A$ have attributes $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m, Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_n$ and $B$ have attributes $Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_n, Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_p$. Thus, $A$ and $B$ can be joined on a shared set of attributes, $Y_i$. Now consider $X, Y, Z$ as three composite attributes (thinking of each group of attributes as a single attribute). Then the natural join of $A$ and $B$, A JOIN B is a relation with heading $X,Y,Z$ and a body consisting of all tuples ($x$, $y$, $z$) such that a tuple appears in $A$ with $X$ value $x$ (i.e. the attributes not shared with B) and $Y$ value $y$ (i.e. the shared key attributes), and a tuple appears in $B$ with $Y$ value $y$ and $Z$ value $z$.

2191846,The category of rings with $1$ vs the category of rings with or without $1$,"The question of whether the definition of a ring should include the existence of an identity for the multiplication (and whether homomorphisms should preserve this identity) seems to divide many mathematicians. Many textbooks considered ""standard"" use different conventions. I am not interested in debating which convention is best. However, I am very interested in the differences between the two categories associated to these two conventions: the category of rings which may or may not have a $1$ (where, of course, morphisms do not preserve the $1$) and the category of rings with $1$ (where morphisms preserve $1$). These two categories appear to be very different. For example, if we require the existence of a $1$, then ideals are no longer objects in our category. If we do not require a $1$, then the zero ring is both an initial and a terminal object (whereas it is only a terminal object in the category of rings with $1$). Are there other important or ""interesting"" distinctions between these two categories?

Thus, we can write $$ S_n = \sum_{j=0}^n \sum_{k=j}^n 3^k = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{ 3^{n+1} - 3^j }{2} = \frac{n 3^{n+1}}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=0}^n 3^j = \boxed {\frac{n 3^{n+1} }{2} - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{ 3^{n+1} - 1 }{2} \right) } $$ Is this a correct argument?","['summation', 'discrete-mathematics']"
2191903,Is $f(x)=x^2$ from $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ surjective?,"A surjective function $f$ is one such that for all $y$ in the codomain of $f$, there exists an $x$ in domain of $f$ such that $f(x) = y$. Mathematically, we can show that for $f(x) = x^2$ where $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, this statement is true. However, looking at the graph, the negative values in the codomain of $f$ do not have any corresponding $x$ values in the domain of $f$. Therefore $f(x)=x^2$ is not surjective? So if I am solving a question like this for a function more complicated than $f(x) = x^2$, and I see that $f(x) = y$, then how to know if it is actually surjective? As it is possible for a function to show that $f(x) = y$ but it may not necessarily be surjective because there may be values in the codomain that do not get mapped by values in the domain, such as $f(x)=x^2$ from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$.

2192201,Particular integral of a fifth order linear ODE?,"I am presented with the differential equation $y^{(5)}-y^{(1)}=x$ Finding the complementary function was OK.

Trying $b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0$ I get $-2b_2x-b_1=x$ which works for $b_1=0, b_2=-1/2$ and I suppose the constant $b_0$ doesn't really matter because it is amalgamated into the constant in the complementary function anyway. However I am finding it quite strange that the form of the particular integral was $b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0$, and not the general form for a linear forcing term of $b_1x+b_0$ that I have been taught to use. I was wondering if there is a rule particular integrals when you have different orders of ODE? I can see here that my first trial would fail because there is no $y$ term on the RHS.

2192314,An interesting pattern in the differences between prime numbers.,"Once upon a time, I was looking at interesting properties of prime numbers. One thing I noticed was that if we take the absolute values of the differences between each prime, and repeat this process on the differences recursively, the first column turns out to always be $1$ (With the exception of the first row) as demonstrated below for the first $10$ primes: $$\begin{matrix} p_n & 2 & & 3 & & 5 & & 7 & & 11 & & 13 & & 17 & & 19 & & 23 & & 29 & \cdots \\ 1^{\text{st}}\text{ difference}&& \color{#007777}1 && 2 && 2 && 4 && 2 && 4 && 2 && 4 && 6 \\2^{\text{nd}}\text{ difference}& && \color{#007777}1 && 0 && 2 && 2 && 2 && 2 && 2 && 2 && \\3^{\text{rd}}\text{ difference} &&&&\color{#007777}1 && 2 && 0 && 0 && 0 && 0 && 0 \\ 4^{\text{th}}\text{ difference}&&&&&\color{#007777}1 && 2 && 0 && 0 && 0 && 0 \\ \vdots &&&&&& \color{#007777}1 && 2 && 0 && 0 && 0 \\ \vdots&&&&&&&\color{#007777}1 && 2 && 0 && 0 \\ \vdots &&&&&&&&\color{#007777}1 && 2 && 0 \\ \vdots &&&&&&&&&\color{#007777}1 && 2 \\ \vdots &&&&&&&&&&\color{#007777}1\end{matrix}$$ For simplicity, we denote the terms in the form $a_{m,n}$ where $m$ is the row number and $n$ is the column number, like this:
$$\begin{matrix} a_{1,1} & & a_{1,2} & & a_{1,3} & & a_{1,4} && a_{1,5} & \cdots \\ & a_{2,1} &&a_{2,2} && a_{2,3} && a_{2,4} \\ && a_{3,1} && a_{3,2} && a_{3,3} \\ &&& a_{4,1} && a_{4,2} \\ &&&&a_{5,1} \end{matrix}$$ The general form for the differences is given by:
$$a_{m+1,n}=|a_{m,n+1}-a_{m,n}| \tag{1}$$ Therefore, I conjectured the following: Let $m$ and $n$ denote the row and column number respectively. Therefore, $a_{m,1}=1$ is true $\forall m\geq 2$ where $m \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, I'd like to know whether this conjecture is true. If so, it would be nice if a proof was provided. Therefore, here I show my thoughts on the problem: The process on $(1)$ of course should be applied recursively to obtain an expression for the elements on the first row. For example, if i put $a_{4,1}$ in terms of the elements of the first row, we obtain:
$$\begin{align} a_{4,1} & =|a_{3,2}-a_{3,1}| \\ &=||a_{2,3}-a_{2,2}|-|a_{2,2}-a_{2,1}|| \\ &=|||a_{1,4}-a_{1,3}|-|a_{1,3}-a_{1,2}||-||a_{1,3}-a_{1,2}|-|a_{1,2}-a_{1,1}||| \end{align}\tag{2}$$
This does not appear obvious as to why the the conjecture is true due to the absolute value signs. Therefore, I decided to abandon using this idea. Somebody had suggested that I use Bertrand's Postulate . I will use the weaker form of the theorem, which states that if $p_n$ is the $n$-th prime, for all $n\geq 1$, then:
$$p_{n+1}<2p_n$$
In that case, I figured that if I apply this on the series with increasing powers of $2$, then:
$$\begin{matrix} \color{#007777}{1} & & \color{#777700}2 & & \color{green}{4} & & \color{orange}8 && 16 & \cdots \\ & \color{#007777}1 && \color{#777700}2 && \color{green}4 && \color{orange}8 \\ && \color{#007777}1 && \color{#777700}2 && \color{green}4 \\ &&& \color{#007777}1 && \color{#777700}2 \\ &&&& \color{#007777}1 \end{matrix}$$
Then each of the columns will have identical values as shown by the different colors above. I figured this was quite similar, and since $p_n\leq 2^n$ where $n\in \mathbb{Z}^+$, thus this would be true for the primes as well. However, it seems doubtful because the differences are not strictly increasing as we can see in the $2^{\text{nd}} \text{ difference}$ in the prime number series and also, we are taking the absolute value of the differences recursively as shown on the example on $(2)$. Therefore, I do not think Bertrand's Postulate can be applied directly as I have done. In summary, I'd like to know whether the conjecture is true. If so, a proof would be nice. Otherwise, if the conjecture is false a form of disproof such as a counterexample would be nice.","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"

Using the Hopf Bifurcation theorem (p. 5-6), it is easy enough to show that a Andronov-Hopf Bifurcation appears when $\varepsilon=0$. The issue is, if $\ell_1=0$, we fail to satisfy the conditions of the Hopf Bifurcation theorem, but a bifurcation still appears. For example, suppose $\ell_1=0$ and $\ell_2=-1$. The following two images show our system for $\varepsilon=-0.1$ and $\varepsilon=0.1$, respectively. So my first question is: How would we show, analytically, that the system \begin{align*}x'&=y+x(\varepsilon+\ell_2(x^4+y^4)) \\y'&=-x+y(\varepsilon+\ell_2(x^4+y^4))\end{align*} has a Hopf Bifurcation at $\varepsilon=0$? Secondly, if $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ have different signs, then we can have two limit cycles, depending on $\varepsilon$. For example, suppose $\ell_1=1$ and $\ell_2=-1$. The next two images show when $\varepsilon=0.1$ and $\varepsilon=-0.1$, respectively. Now, these two limit cycles will eventually collapse on each other as $\varepsilon$ decreases, but otherwise, there is always at least one limit cycle.

2192748,Contracting the metric tensor with itself using Einstein summation,"Say we have a diagonal metric with components $g_{\mu \nu}$. When contracting with the inverse metric, we have the identity
$$ g_{\mu \nu}g^{\nu \lambda} = \delta_{\mu}^{\lambda}.$$
When both pairs of components are equal, in the Einstein summation convention contraction should leave us with the trace of the Kronecker delta,
$$ g_{\mu \nu}g^{\nu \mu} = \delta_{\mu}^{\mu} = n$$
on an $n$-dimensional manifold. Now let us say we have contracted a rank-2 tensor to form a scalar by
$$ g^{\nu \lambda}T_{\lambda\nu} = t.$$
If we multiply by the metric following the first equation above, we find
\begin{align}
g_{\mu\nu}g^{\nu \lambda}T_{\lambda\nu} &= g_{\mu\nu}t, \\
\Rightarrow \delta_{\mu}^{\lambda}T_{\lambda\nu}&= T_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu}t.

If however we multiply by the metric using the same indices, as in the second case above, we find

g_{\mu\nu}g^{\mu\nu}T_{\mu\nu} &= g_{\mu\nu}t, \\
\Rightarrow \delta_{\mu}^{\mu}T_{\mu\nu}&= g_{\mu\nu}t.

It seems clear that one can contract the Kronecker delta upper $\mu$ index with the lower $\mu$ index in $T_{\mu\nu}$ to obtain the same result as the first time. What is unclear to me is exactly why the interpretation $\delta_{\mu}^{\mu}=n $ in this case is incorrect. I can't seem to justify with proper rigour why that contraction makes no sense here, even though I can see that it's wrong and am otherwise happy with the correct interpretation. My intuition is that the LHS has to be treated like a rank 4 tensor, and the trace of this tensor over the delta indices does not mean we introduce a scalar factor to the resulting contracted tensor.

While air is heated in a region, it expands in all directions, and thus the velocity field points outward from that region."" If we have a vector field which represents a force, I interpret the divergence as representing the strength of the field at whatever point it's taken at. However I'm confused on how to interpret the divergence of a velocity field. Clearly if the divergence is positive gas is expanding outward and if it's negative it's contracting, however what quantity is actually represented? If I have a velocity field with $m/s$ units, then the div presumably has $m/s^2$ units. Is the quantity we get the actual acceleration of gas away from that point?","['multivariable-calculus', 'divergence-operator']"
2192760,Equality on a limit involving solution of heat equation,"I've been trying to solve one exercise on PDEs for a while now and I have everything except from this equality . It would be really useful if this were true, but I can't prove it and I think it should be because I am following some hints and I got here. Here $g$ can be smooth, $g(0)=0$ and that's what we know. The step is $$\lim_\limits{x\rightarrow 0^+}\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{4\pi}}\int\limits_0^{t-\delta}\dfrac{1}{(t-s)^{3/2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{4(t-s)}}g(s) ds+\lim_\limits{x\rightarrow 0^+}\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{4\pi}}\int\limits_{t-\delta}^t\dfrac{1}{(t-s)^{3/2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{4(t-s)}}g(s) ds$$ $$= g(t) \lim_\limits{x\rightarrow 0^+}\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{4\pi}}\int\limits_{t-\delta}^t\dfrac{1}{(t-s)^{3/2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{4(t-s)}}ds$$ So this is what I think: since we have excluded $t$ from the first integral, we can simply substitute $x$ by $0$ and so the first limit is $0$. Now this is not true for the second limit, as the integral explodes close to $0$. But how can $g$ leave the integral? Is it some argument of continuity? I tried integration by parts but I don't seem to go anywhere. Thank you very much for your attention!","['analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

2192992,Truly intuitive geometric interpretation for the transpose of a square matrix,"I'm looking for an easily understandable interpretation for a transpose of a square matrix A. An intuitive visual demonstration, how $A^{T}$ relates to A. I want to be able to instantly visualize in my mind what I'm doing to the space when transposing the vectors of a matrix. From experience, understanding linear algebra concepts in two dimensions is often enough to understand concepts in any higher dimension, so an explanation for two dimensional spaces should be enough I think. All explanations I found so far were not intuitive enough, as I want to be able to instantly imagine (and draw) how $A^{T}$ looks like given A. I'm not a mathematician btw. Here is what I found so far (but not intuitive enough for me) (Ax)$\cdot$y=$(Ax)^{T}$y=$x^{T}A^{T}$y=x$\cdot$$A^{T}$y As far I understand dot product is a projection (x onto y, y onto x, both interpretations have the same result) followed by a scaling by the length of the other vector. This would mean that mapping x into space A and projecting y onto the result is the same as mapping y into the space of $A^{T}$, then projecting the unmapped x into $A^{T}$y So $A^{T}$ is the specific space B for any pair of vectors (x,y) such that Ax$\cdot$y=x$\cdot$By This doesn't tell me instantly how $A^{T}$ drawn as vectors would look like based on A drawn as vectors. ""reassigning dimensions"" This one is hard to explain so let me do this with a drawing: parallel projections This explanation is much more visual, but far too messy to do it in my head instantly. There are also multiple ways I could have rotated and arranged the vectors around the result $A^{T}$ which is represented in the middle. Also, it doesn't feel like it makes me truly understand the transposing of matrices, especially in higher dimensions. some kind of weird rotation Symmetrical matrices can be decomposed into a rotation, scaling along eigenvectors $\Lambda$ and a rotation back A=R$\Lambda$$R^{T}$ So in this specific case, the transpose is a rotation in the opposite direction of the original. I don't know how to generalize that into arbitrary matrices. I'm wildly guessing that if A is not symmetric any more, $R^{T}$ must also include some additional operations besides rotation. Can anyone help me to find a way to easily and instantly imagine/draw how $A^{T}$ looks like given A in two dimensional space? (In a way of understanding that is generalizable into higher dimensions) Edit 1: While working on the problem I was curious to see what B in $BA=A^{T}$ looks like. B would describe what needs to be done to A in order to geometrically transpose it. My temporary result looks interesting but I'm still trying to bring it to an interpretable form. If we assume the following indexing order $$A=
        \begin{bmatrix}
        a_{11} & a_{12} \\
        a_{21} & a_{22} \\
        \end{bmatrix}
$$ and $det(A)\neq0$ then $$B=\frac{1}{det(A)}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        a_{11} a_{22} - a_{21}^2 & a_{11} (a_{21} - a_{12})  \\
        a_{22} (a_{12} - a_{21}) & a_{11} a_{22} - a_{12}^2 \\
        \end{bmatrix}
$$ What's visible on the first sight is that $\frac{1}{det(A)}$ causes scaling such that the area becomes exactly 1 (before applying the actual matrix). B must also preserve the area as $det(A^{T})=det(A)$. It means that the matrix $B'=\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} a_{22} - a_{21}^2 & a_{11} (a_{21} - a_{12})  \\
a_{22} (a_{12} - a_{21}) & a_{11} a_{22} - a_{12}^2 \\
\end{bmatrix}$ squares the area while transposing. Edit 2: The same matrix can be written as $B'=\begin{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{21} \\
\end{bmatrix}  
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{22} \\ -a_{21} \\

When I draw them it looks like I only need to rotate each by 90 degress in different directions to end up with the transpose column vectors. Edit 3: Maybe I fool myself, but I think I'm getting closer. The column space $C=
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{1}  & c_{2}  \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{22}  & -a_{12}  \\
-a_{21} & a_{11} \\

a_{21} & a_{22} \\

\begin{bmatrix}

\\
a_2^{T}A^{-1}
\\
\end{bmatrix}$ Edit 4: I think I will post my own answer soon. Going down the path of $A^{-1}$ had the idea that one can exploit the symmetry of of $AA^{T}$. Symmetry means that $AA^{T}$ decomposes nicer: $AA^{T} = R_{AA^{T}} \Lambda_{AA^{T}} (R^{-1})_{AA^{T}}$ Now if you multiply both sides with $A^{-1}$ you'll get $A^{T} = A^{-1} R_{AA^{T}} \Lambda_{AA^{T}} (R^{-1})_{AA^{T}}$ When I do an example with numbers I can also see that in my example $R_{AA^{T}} = (R^{-1})_{AA^{T}}$ $R_{AA^{T}}$ mirrors the space along y axis and then rotates by some angle $\alpha$ So my suspicion right now is: $A^{T}=A^{-1} R_{AA^{T}} \Lambda_{AA^{T}} R_{AA^{T}}$ Now if I define $R_{AA^{T}}^{'} = \begin{bmatrix}
cos \alpha & -sin \alpha \\
sin \alpha & cos \alpha \\
\end{bmatrix}$ to get the mirroring out of the matrix $R_{AA^{T}}$ then I get $A^{T}=A^{-1} 
R_{AA^{T}}^{'} 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\Lambda_{AA^{T}} 
R_{AA^{T}}^{'}

-1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \\

$ So generally $A^{T}=A^{-1} R_{\alpha} M_y \Lambda R_{\alpha} M_y$ With $M_y$ being the mirroring along the y axis, $R_{\alpha}$ some counter-clockwise rotation by $\alpha$ and $\Lambda$ some scaling","['matrices', 'transpose', 'geometric-interpretation', 'linear-algebra', 'vector-spaces']"

2193197,How to factor in cubic extensions?,"Working within the field $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$, for any cube root of $n$, how does one factor the unramified rational prime ideals $(p)$? For starters, I'm relatively new to this and not too sure I completely understand factoring in these extensions, and so I'll instead talk about factoring $x^3-n$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$. Assuming for simplicity that $\mathcal{O}^{K}=\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt[3]{n})$, it's obvious that if $p \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$, then $x^3-n=0$ has exactly one solution in $\mathbb{F}_{p}$. For $p \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, I have no clue what is supposed to be done. I know that there must be three solutions or no solutions, but getting there is the problem. All I've been able to think of that might be key to figuring this out is assigning the Frobenius a conjugacy clas s of $S_{3}$ due to the fact that $\mid\rho(p)\mid=\chi_{3}(p)$, where $\rho(p)$ is some representation of an element within the conjugacy class and $\chi_{3}(p)$ is the non-trivial Dirichlet Character of modulus 3. This seems nice since it  alludes to working within $\mathbb{Z}(\frac{-1+\sqrt{-3}}{2})$ for the answer, and for one case, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$, the solution does indeed involve $\mathbb{Z}(\frac{-1+\sqrt{-3}}{2})$ (understanding how this connection is made is difficult).","['abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'maximal-and-prime-ideals', 'cubic-reciprocity']"

Also please verify if my proof is good enough. Here is my approach, Proof -  Let, $\sqrt r = p$ and $\sqrt s = q$ where $p, q \in \mathbb{R^+}$ . Then, $\sqrt r \sqrt s  = p\cdot q$ ... (1) Squaring both the sides we get, $(\sqrt r \sqrt s)^2  = (p\cdot q)^2$ ...(2) $(\sqrt r \sqrt s)^2 = (r^{1/2}\cdot s^{1/2})^2$ [as $\sqrt a = a^{1/2}$ ] Lemma 1 - $\forall a, b \in  \mathbb{R} [(a\cdot  b )^2 = a^2\cdot  b^2] $ Proof - By definition of squaring, $ a^2 = a\cdot a$ It follows from the definition that, $(a \cdot b)^2 = (a \cdot b ) (a\cdot b) = a^2\cdot b^2$ $\blacksquare$ From lemma 1, $(r^{1/2}\cdot s^{1/2})^2 = r^{2 / 2}\cdot  s^{2/2} = r\cdot s$ Therefore, $(\sqrt r \sqrt s)^2 =  r\cdot s$ From equation 2, we have, $r\cdot s = (p\cdot q)^2 $ ...(3) If the equality holds the LHS of the equation must yield the same result as equation 1, Now from equation 3, $ \sqrt {r\cdot  s} = \sqrt{(p\cdot q)^2}$ $\sqrt{(p\cdot q)^2} = ((p\cdot q)^2)^{1/2}$ [as $\sqrt a = a^{1/2}$ ] Now from the power rule $(a^b)^c = a^{b\cdot c}$ , it follows that $((p\cdot q)^2)^{1/2} = (p\cdot q)^{2/2}= p\cdot q$ .. (4) From equation (1) and equation (4). As both sides yield the same result, it is true that, $ \forall r, s \in \mathbb{R^+}  \sqrt {r. s}  = \sqrt r \cdot \sqrt s$ $\blacksquare$ I have one concern with this proof, by this same reasoning that I have followed, I can even prove the statement for $\forall r, s \in \mathbb{R^-}$ , which is not true , so I must be wrong somewhere.","['algebra-precalculus', 'proof-writing', 'proof-verification']"

The reason being is that it seems like they are calculating the expected number of birthdays not the expected number of distinct birthdays.

Also, if you'd like to look into the original problem directly, please go to this question .","['regression', 'asymptotics', 'statistics', 'estimation', 'central-limit-theorem']"
2193710,Self-study Dummit and Foote,"I am going to be taking a year off from my studies and would like to self study abstract algebra as it is right now the biggest gap in my math background. I have a copy of Dummit and Foote from which I would like to study, however I realize that it contains quite a large amount of material! I would thus like to put together a list of essential topics to cover so that at the end I would have covered a similar content to a third year undergraduate course for mathematicians. One thing I would like to do if possible is get an introduction to Galois theory, it is quite mysterious to me and I would love to get acquainted to the subject. I am (quite unfortunately) in electrical engineering, although I am directing myself to do a masters in math or perhaps control theory on the mathematical side of things. As such I have taken as many math course as I could and have done some self studying so that I think I now have a reasonable degree of mathematical maturity (real analysis, topology, differential geometry, linear algebra of course, probability and stats, discrete math, etc). Unfortunately I can't take as many pure math courses an as a math undergrad which is why I want to self-study abstract algebra. I know this is an ambitious project but I am quite motivated so any tips are very appreciated!","['abstract-algebra', 'self-learning']"
2193720,Find a point on a line segment which is the closest to other point not on the line segment,"My question is in the context of a line segment and not in the context of a line which has infinite length. Lets say I have two points in 2d which represent for me a line segment and I got another point which is not on the line segment. How do I find the point on the line segment which is the closest to the point that is not on the line segment. P.S.
I have seen couple of similar questions about that but all in the context of line and not line segment. Thank you in advance.",['geometry']
2193723,"How to ""fix"" $\int_{-1}^1 \frac {dx}{x^2}$ with complex numbers?","Given the following definite integral, $$\int_{-1}^1 \frac {dx}{x^2}$$ I can see that it is an improper integral because of the asymptote at $x=0$ and I know from the graph of $\frac 1{x^2}$ that both parts on either side of the $y$-axis are identical. Hence, computing only the part on the right of the $y$-axis I find that the integral $\int_{-1}^1 \frac {dx}{x^2}$ is divergent since $-$as expected from the graph of $\frac 1{x^2}-$ this part goes to $\infty$: $$\lim_{\epsilon\to 0^+}\int_{0+\epsilon}^1 \frac {dx}{x^2} \;=\; \lim_{\epsilon\to 0^+}-\frac 1x \;\bigg|_{\,0+\epsilon}^1 \;=\; -1-\left(\lim_{\epsilon\to 0^+}-\frac 1{0+\epsilon}\right) \;=\; \infty\;.$$ If I intentionally overlook that and blindly compute the integral, I get the silly result $$\int_{-1}^1 \frac {dx}{x^2} = -2\;.$$ That is, a negative value for the area under a function that is above the $x$-axis everywhere. I was told that $\int_{-1}^1 \frac {dx}{x^2}$ can be ""fixed"" using imaginary numbers by a T.A. but neither of us had the time to expand on that point. I understand complex numbers and how they work so I am left to wonder; how can I ""fix"" an improper integral using complex numbers?","['complex-numbers', 'calculus', 'improper-integrals', 'integration', 'definite-integrals']"
