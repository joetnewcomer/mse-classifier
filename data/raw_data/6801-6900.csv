51004,How to show that this series does not converge uniformly on the open unit disc?,"Given the series $\sum_{k=0}^\infty z^k $, it is easy to see that it converges locally, but how do I go about showing that it does not also converge uniformly on the open unit disc? I know that for it to converge uniformly on the open disc that $sup{|g(z) - g_k(z)|}$, z element of open unit disc, must equal zero. However, I am finding it difficult to show that this series does not go to zero as k goes to infinity.

51049,Solutions to $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{A}}\boldsymbol{\mathbf{x}} = \boldsymbol{\mathbf{b}}$,"I'm self-studying a bit of introductory linear algebra, watching the lectures on MIT OCW given by Gilbert Strang. The course isn't too rigourous and gives many things without proof, most of which I can reason through and convince myself of so far, but I've run into one thing that I can't wrap my head around. So he's discussing an algorithm to solve the system of linear equations $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{A}}\boldsymbol{\mathbf{x}} = \boldsymbol{\mathbf{b}}$. And basically he says that all we need to do is find a particular solution to the equation (after elimination) and then add it to any vector in the nullspace of the matrix. It's obvious why the sum of the particular solution and the nullspace vector is part of the solution set to $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{A}}\boldsymbol{\mathbf{x}} = \boldsymbol{\mathbf{b}}$. It's not obvious to me, however, why all solutions to the equation can be described as that type of sum. Could someone explain to me why this is true?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

I have figured out the question when it's the other way around, but I am not making any progress here. The worst thing is, I don't know how to think of such problems, and even when it was functions from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\{0, 1\}$, I would have never gotten it myself without help. When I think about this I think of the following: it's a function, so one thing can't be sent to two+ things, but two things can be sent to the same thing. So at least, we are mapping both 0 and 1 to the same element, and at most we are mapping it to two different elements. But that doesn't really give me anything...

51064,Construction of the monoid of fractions,"This question comes from my attempt to solve Exercise 17(b) of Bourbaki, Algebra , Chapter 1, §2. Let $E$ be a commutative monoid (written multiplicatively) and $S$ a submonoid of $E$. Define on $E\times S$ an equivalence relation by $(a,s)\sim(b,t):\Leftrightarrow$ ""$\exists u\in S$ such that $atu=bsu$"". Denote the set $(E\times S)/\sim$ by $\overline{E}$ and the class of $(a,s)$ by $a/s$. For any $a\in E$, let $\epsilon(a)=a/e$. So far so good. The Bourbaki exercise is actually more general (replacing commutativity by weaker assumptions), but, even in this special case, I can't do the next step: Show that there exists on $\overline{E}$ one and only one monoid structure such that $\epsilon$ is a monoid homomorphism and such that, for all $s\in S$, $\epsilon(s)$ is invertible. My problem is with the ""only one"" part. Given a monoid structure $\otimes$ on $\overline{E}$ with those properties, I see no reason why $(a/s)\otimes(b/t)=(ab)/(st)$ or even $(s/e)\otimes(e/s)=e/e$. I couldn't find a counterexample in the case $E=\mathbb{N}$, nor did the search give me any intuition on why the assertion should be true. This commutative case is treated in the text of Bourbaki's Algebra , but there no mention is made of ""only one"". I'm glad for anything that gets me started.","['abstract-algebra', 'monoid']"

51080,Convergence of Integral Implies Uniform convergence of Equicontinuous Family,"Let $\{f_n\}$ be an equicontinuous family of functions on $[0,1]$ such that each $f_n$ is pointwise bounded and $\int_{[a,b]} f_n(x)dx \rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$, for every $  0\leq a \leq b \leq 1$. Show $f_n$ converges to $0$ uniformly. For this question I know that there exists a uniformly convergent subsequence $f_{n_k}$ by Arzela-Ascoli Theorem. For this uniformly convergent sequence I know $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int_a^bf_{n_k}(x)dx = \int_a^b \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}f_{n_k}(x)dx$$
Since the left side is zero If we assume $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}f_{n_k}(x)dx \neq \ 0$ for some $x\in [0,1]$ Then uniform continuity of the limit implies that it is $\neq 0$ on some interval which implies the integral is $\neq 0$ Which is a contradiction . Thus $f_{n_k}$ must converge uniformly to $0$. I don't see how to get to $f_n$ converges uniformly to $0$ though.","['convergence-divergence', 'integration', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

Easy : If we call $E$ the intersection of the two lines and $\alpha$ the angle between them, we find that it is the circle of center $E$ and radius $\frac{\lambda}{2\sin \alpha}$. 2) Same question but this time we fix $FG+FH$ and not $HG$, in other words, the equation becomes $FG+FH=\lambda$. Here I don't have any idea. First I conjectured that it might be a circle of center $E$ too, but later I found out that it is impossible... Any hints please ?

51107,Möbius transformations and the Lorentz group,"In Tristan Needham's wonderful book Visual Complex Analysis , the chapter on Möbius transformations begins by asserting that they correspond one-to-one with the Lorentz transformations from special relativity. I tried to work out the details of this correspondence and I would like my results to be confirmed or corrected. I am pretty sure of my work but wanted to ask because it differs slightly from what Needham asserts. I am working with the following definitions: (1) The Möbius transformations are transformations of the complex plane of the form $z \mapsto \frac{az+b}{cz+d}, a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{C}, ad-bc \neq 0$. I'll refer to the group of these as $P(1,\mathbb{C})$, the notation in Ahlfors . (2) The Lorentz group is the group of linear transformations of $\mathbb{R}^4$ that preserve the Lorentz form $t^2-x^2-y^2-z^2$. Thus it is represented by the set of real 4x4 matrices satisfying $M^tI_{1,3}M=I_{1,3}$ where $I_{1,3}$ is the matrix of the Lorentz form, i.e. $1, -1, -1, -1$ on the main diagonal and zero elsewhere. For the group I'll use the notation $O_{1,3}$ from Artin . (3) A ""space-like interval"" is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^4$ on which the Lorentz form is negative; a ""time-like interval"" is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^4$ on which the Lorentz form is positive. I am adopting the convention that time is the first coordinate. After many hours of work I now believe the following: (a) The isomorphism with $P(1,\mathbb{C})$ really only belongs to a subgroup of $O_{1,3}$ of index 4, call it $M$. There is a subgroup of index 2 of $O_{1,3}$ that has a surjective homomorphism to $P(1,\mathbb{C})$, but it is not bijective because the kernel is $\{I,-I\}$. The Lorentz transformations in the coset of the index 2 subgroup actually map to orientation-reversing transformations of $\mathbb{C}$ which are thus not Möbius transformations. (b) $M$ is the path component containing $I$. (c) Also, $M$ is the set of Lorentz transformations that preserve the direction of time on time-like intervals and also preserve the orientation of 3-space given by the space-components of sets of 3 linearly independent space-like intervals. (d) However, even the transformations in this subgroup $M$ are capable of reversing time on space-like intervals or the orientation of space given by the space components of sets of 3 time-like intervals. Is all this correct? If/where incorrect, what is true instead?","['linear-algebra', 'complex-analysis']"
51111,"Calculating point on a circle, given an offset?","I have what seemed like a very simple issue, but I just cannot figure it out.  I have the following circles around a common point: The Green and Blue circles represent circles that orbit the center point.  I have been able to calculate the distance/radius from the point to the individual circles, but I am unable to plot the next point on either circle, given an angle from the center point.  Presently, my calculation looks like the following: The coordinates of one of my circles is: y1 = 152
x1 = 140.5 And my calculation for the next point, 1 degree from the starting point (140.5,152) is: distance = SQRT((160-x1)^2 + (240-y1)^2) = 90.13
new x = 160 - (distance x COS(1 degree x (PI / 180)))
new y = 240 - (distance x SIN(1 degree x (PI / 180))) My new x and y give me crazy results, nothing even close to my circle. I can't figure out how to calculate the new position, given the offset of 160, 240 being my center, and what I want to rotate around.  Where am I going wrong? Update: I have implemented what I believe to be the correct formula, but I'm only getting a half circle, e.g. x1 = starting x coordinate, or updated coordinate
y1 = starting y coordinate, or updated y coordinate    
cx = 100 (horizontal center)
cy = 100 (vertical center)

radius = SQRT((cx - x1)^2 + (cy - y1)^2)
arc = ATAN((y1 - cy) / (x1 - cx))
newX = cx + radius * COS(arc - PI - (PI / 180.0))
newY = cy + radius * SIN(arc - PI - (PI / 180.0))

Set the values so next iteration of drawing, x1 and y1 will be the new
base for the calculation.
x1 = newX
y1 = newY The circle begins to draw at the correct coordinates, but once it hits 180 degrees, it jumps back up to zero degrees.  The dot represents the starting point.  Also, the coordinates are going counterclockwise, when they need to go clockwise.  Any ideas?",['trigonometry']

51144,Abstract Nonsingular Curves,"In section I.6 of Algebraic Geometry , Hartshorne establishes a that every curve is birationally equivalent to a nonsingular projective curve. To do this, he defines for any given curve $C$ with function field $K$ an abstract nonsingular curve $C_K$ whose points are just DVR's of $K$ with an appropriate topology. It can be shown that $C_K$ is isomorphic to a nonsingular projective curve. Later on in ex II.3.8, Hartshorne defines the normalization of a scheme, which in the case of curves will be a nonsingular curve that is birational to the original curve. In general, do these two constructions give the same curve? They give birational curves by II.6.12, but I would like to say that they are actually the same. If this is not true, can we at least say that the normalization has an open immersion into $C_K$? I have a hunch that the latter statement should be true since the points of a nonsingular curve just correspond to DVR's of $K.$ Thanks ahead of time.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"
51146,Hodge Number Jump in Family Example,"This is based on a comment here: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/67485/can-proper-smooth-base-change-be-used-to-show-that-varieties-cannot-be-lifted-to I felt funny about the comment and I tried to prove it, but instead came up with a way to construct a counterexample. Since I'm still learning this stuff, it is possible I've made some glaring error, though. The comment: If $X$ is a smooth proper variety over a field of positive characteristic and $h^n(X, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)\neq \sum_{p+q=n} h^{pq}(X)$ for some $n$, then $X$ cannot be lifted to characteristic $0$. Or in other words, if the $\ell$-adic and Hodge Betti numbers do not match for some $n$, then it cannot be lifted. Here is my proposed counterexample. Find a smooth proper $Y\to S$ where $S=\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ for $R$ a DVR with mixed characteristic ($R/m=k$ of characteristic $p>0$, and $\mathrm{Frac}(R)=K$ of characteristic $0$) with the following property: Some Hodge number satisfies $h^{st}(Y_0)> h^{st}(\overline{Y}_\eta)$ where $\overline{Y}_\eta$ means the geometric generic fiber. So we are looking for an example where some Hodge number jumps up at the special fiber. I don't see any immediate reason why this can't happen, since they should be merely upper semicontinuous. Here is my attempted proof of why this gives a counterexample. Well, first $Y_0/k$ is a characteristic $p$ variety that can be lifted to characteristic $0$ just by construction. Suppose $n=s+t$ from the example. We have the sequence of (in)equalities $h^n(Y_0, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)= h^n(\overline{Y}_\eta, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)=\sum h^{pq}(\overline{Y}_\eta)<\sum h^{pq}(Y_0)$ which comes respectively from smooth base change for etale cohomology, and then the fact that $\overline{Y}_\eta$ is a smooth variety over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ (by Deligne-Illusie the Hodge-de Rham SS degenerates at $E_1$ but maybe the error is that $\ell$-adic and de Rham don't match up?), and then the assumption about Hodge numbers jumping. In other words, such a variety $Y_0$ would be liftable with $\ell$-adic and Hodge Betti numbers being different. Question: What is a good example of where this happens? Or, if the original comment was correct what is an actual proof and where does mine go wrong? Thanks! P.S. It is very annoying that you can't reply to comments on MO, so the person never learns of a reply. This has happened several times to me now.","['homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-geometry']"

There are about 1000 unique digital products that are held in the inventory management system and they are sourced from a variety of other source systems. I can measure the number of orders that are occurring in each of the clients because they are reporting the distribution of the digital product to the centralized system.

51212,Difficulties in solving a PDE problem,"This is an exercise in ""Variation et optimisation des formes"" , chapter 3, Ex. 3.8. The preliminaries are:

$$\Omega_n = D\setminus \bigcup_{0<i,j<n} \overline{B}(x_{ij},r_n), u_n=u_{\Omega_n}^f.$$ We pick $r_n=e^{-dn^2}$. The notation $u_\Omega^f$ is the unique solution of the problem $-\Delta u=f$, which means 
$$ \int_\Omega fv=\int_\Omega \nabla u \nabla v,\ \forall v \in H_0^1(\Omega).$$ 1) Prove that there exists $u^* \in H_0^1(D)$ and a subsequence of $u_n$ which converges weakly in $H_0^1(D)$ to $u^*$ and strongly in $L^2(D)$ to the same function. This is not very hard, and there are some theorems in the book which help. 2) This is the part where it becomes messy. Consider the squares centred at $x_{ij}$ with sides $1/n$. Consider further the circles inscribed in these squares and denote with $C_{ij}^n$ the annulus formed by the inscribed circle in the square (centred in $x_{ij}$ with radius $1/2n$) and the circle of center $x_{ij}$ and radius $r_n$. Define the following functions $z_n \in H^1(D)$ with the properties $\Delta z_n=0$ on $C_{ij}^n$; $z_n=0$ on $B(x_{ij},r_n)$; $z_n=1$ elsewhere. Determine the expression of $z_n$ for each small square (cell)[I managed to do this assuming that the solutions are radially constant around $x_{ij}$].

The problem has more parts, but to get there I need to understand this one. Thank you.

51246,Can someone explain the Y Combinator?,"The Y combinator is a concept in functional programming, borrowed from the lambda calculus. It is a fixed-point combinator. A fixed point combinator $G$ is a higher-order function (a functional, in mathematical language) that, given a function $f$, returns a fixed point of $f$. In mathematical language, $$f(G(f)) = G(f)$$ This can be considered the defining equation of a fixed-point combinator. Note that $f$ might be a function whose range and domain are themselves function spaces -- in fact this is the most common use of a fixed-point combinator: you can define a function $\alpha$ by specifying that it is the fixed point of another function $f$, and then compute $\alpha$ as $G(f)$. As mathematicians we're used to functions having names, eg $f:x\mapsto x^2$ is the function called $f$ that maps $x$ to $x^2$. But there's no reason why you can't have anonymous function. Since the lambda calculus deals with these a lot, there's a special notation for them: $$\lambda x.x^2$$ is the function that takes $x$ to $x^2$, so that e.g. $(\lambda x.x^2)(2) = 4$. When there's no ambiguity, we can write function application by concatenation: $(\lambda x.x^2) 2 = 4$, and if we defined $f = \lambda x.x^2$ then $f\; 2 = 4$. Okay, now we get to the meat of the question. The Y combinator is a higher-order function (functional) defined as $$Y = \lambda f. (\lambda x. f (x\;x)) \; (\lambda x. f (x\;x))$$ I can follow through the algebra and see that this is indeed a fixed-point combinator: $$\begin{align}
Y\; g
& = (\lambda f. (\lambda x. f (x\;x)) \; (\lambda x. f (x\;x))) \; g \\
& = (\lambda x. g (x\;x)) \; (\lambda x. g (x\;x)) \\
& = (\lambda y. g (y\;y)) \; (\lambda x. g (x\;x)) \\
& = g \; (\lambda x. g (x\;x)) (\lambda x. g (x\;x)) \\
& = g\; (Y\; g)
\end{align}$$ but I have no intuition as to why it works, or how someone might have come up with it. More to the point, I don't see how it can be practically used to compute functions as fixed-points of functionals.

51274,Motivation for supermanifolds,"Physicists have invented supersymmetry in which they use new variables, mathematically corresponding to Graßmann numbers (elements of some exterior algebra) and physically to ""fermionic degrees of freedom"". Other notions have been developped as well, like super vector spaces, super algebras, super Lie algebras, etc (that is, $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-graded objects). These structures are ""quite easy"" to find in the realm of Mathematics. But then the theory of supermanifolds has been invented (there are different versions of it), and I am wondering what interests mathematicians have to expand this theory beyond the needs of Physics. Well, for me, it is quite difficult to think of some aspects of differential geometry without refering to corresponding aspects of Physics (general relativity, gauge theory, string theory, etc). So my question is: Is there any motivation to introduce in Mathematics the notion of supermanifolds? Could somebody provide some striking example?

I understand the idea for showing that they are locally contractible, but I don't accept the proof yet, several details are missing in my mind. ((( Basic idea : You take a point and an open neighborhood, and construct, one $n$-skeleton at a time, a growing family of open contractible neighborhoods in said $n$-skeleton : they are obtained by thickening the 'traces' of the previous, lower dimensional neighborhood in the newly attached cells, staying small enough to still fit inside the original neighborhood.))) My problem arises when I want to show that certain homotopies between maps defined on (open) subset of CW complexes are continuous. I know one way of how to show that homotopies of maps defined on quotient spaces are continuous. If $X$ is a topological space and $\mathcal{R}$ an equivalence relation on $X$, then the canonical continuous bijection 
$$\frac{X\times I}{\mathcal{R}\times 1}\rightarrow X/\mathcal{R}\times I,~[(x,t)]\mapsto([x],t)$$
is a homeomorphism ($I=[0,1]$, and $\mathcal{R}\times 1$ is the equivalence relation on $X\times I$ such that $(x,t)\sim (x',t')$ iff $x\mathcal{R}x'$ and $t=t'$). I'll phrase my $~~~~~~\mathrm{QUESTIONS}~~~~~~$ in the framework of CW complexes, but they are actually about subspaces of inductive limits and products with other spaces. Suppose $(X,(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}})$ is a CW complex, and I have a subset $Y\subset X$, and I define for all $n\in\mathbb{N},~Y_n=Y\cap X_n$, then I can define on $Y$ two topologies : the subspace topology (as a subspace of $X$) and the limit topology associated with the inclusions $$Y_0 \hookrightarrow Y_1 \hookrightarrow Y_2 \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow Y_n \hookrightarrow Y_{n+1} \hookrightarrow \cdots  $$ it follows from definitions that the canonical map $$Y_{\mathrm{ind.lim.}}\hookrightarrow Y_{\mathrm{subspace}}$$ is a continuous bijection. Similarly, i have at least $2$ natural topologies on $Y\times I$ : the inductive limit topology $(Y\times I)_{\mathrm{lim.ind.}}$ of $$Y_0 \times I \hookrightarrow Y_1\times I \hookrightarrow Y_2\times I \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow Y_n\times I \hookrightarrow Y_{n+1}\times I \hookrightarrow \cdots  $$ 
and the product topology $Y_{\mathrm{ind.lim.}}\times I$ (there is also the product topology $Y_{\mathrm{subspace}}\times I$). As before, there is a canonical continuous bijection $$(Y\times I)_{\mathrm{lim.ind.}}\hookrightarrow Y_{\mathrm{ind.lim.}}\times I~~(\hookrightarrow Y_{\mathrm{subspace}}\times I)$$ It seems to me some proofs I've come across where one constructs homotopies between maps defined on a CW complex tacitly assume some of these maps to be homeomorphisms.

Let $G=\{f_1,\cdots,f_m\}$ and let $(x_i,y_i):=f_i(0,0)$ . Then the point $P=(\bar{x},\bar{y})=\left( \dfrac{x_1+\cdots+x_m}{m},\dfrac{y_1+\cdots+y_m}{m}\right)$ is the centroid of the set $S=\{(x_i,y_i)\ |\ i=1,\cdots,m\}$ . The isometries in $G$ permute the points in $S$ among themselves, since if $f_i f_j=f_k$ then $f_i(x_j,y_j)=f_if_j(0,0)=f_k(0,0)=(x_k,y_k)$ . It can be shown that the centroid of a set of points is uniquely determined by its distances from the points, and since each isometry in $G$ just permutes the set $S$ , it must leave the centroid $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ fixed.

So we've heard of a set being described as ""closed under"" an operation, as well as an operation being ""closed over"" a set. First, correct me if I'm wrong, but my impression is that these things mean the same thing. Second, does this terminology have a precise definition?
For instance we'd normally say that set $A$ is closed under $f:X\rightarrow Y$ if $A\subseteq X$ and for any $x\in A$, $f(x)\in A$.  But it's also common to extend the definition such that $X$ isn't a superset of $A$ but of $A^n$ for some $n$.  For instance, we'd say $A$ is closed under addition if the addition operator maps elements of $A^2$ to $A$.  Does this extend to anything bigger than $n$-tuples?  Infinite sequences, for instance? Third, what's the motivation for this terminology and is it in any way related to the normal topological definition of closedness?  There's a way that closed sets are related to sets that are closed under a particular operation in certain topological spaces (if you allow the usage that includes infinite sequences as above), but I haven't come up with a general relation between the two concepts.

Generally $M$ is an $R$ -module. $\textbf{Theorem.}$ A finitely generated torsion-free module over a PID is free. $\textbf{Proof.}$ The proof given in the book is as follows. Let $M$ be a torsion-free non-zero module, generated by $X=\{x_{1},\dots,x_{m}\}$ .  By reordering if necessary, we may assume that, $\mathscr{B} =\{x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{m}\}$ is a maximal linearly independent subset of $X$ . Let $F=\text{span}\:\mathscr{B}$ . Since $M$ is non-zero and torsion-free, we have $m \geq 1$ . For each $i$ , there are scalars, $a_{i},a_{ij}$ not all zero such that $$a_{i}x_{i} + \sum\limits_{j=1}^{m} a_{ij}x_{j}=0.\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad (\star)$$ Since $\mathscr{B}$ is linearly independent, it is clear that $a_{i} \neq 0$ , for all $i$ . Let $a=a_{1}a_{2}\cdots a_{n}$ so that $a_{n} \neq 0$ .  For $(\star)$ , $a_{i}x_{i} \in F$ and so $ax_{i} \in F$ , for all $i$ , i.e. $aM \subseteq F$ . Now the map $\nu:M \to F$ , $x \to ax$ , is $R$ -linear and a monomorphism since $M$ is torsion-free. Hence $M \cong \nu(M)$ which is submodule of the free module $F$ and so $\nu(M)$ is free by $\textbf{Theorem A}$ (see below), i.e. $M$ is free as required. $\textbf{Theorem A.}$ Let $F$ be a free $R$ -module and $M$ a submodule of $F$ . Then $M$ is also free and $\dim_RM \leq \dim_RF$ . I would like to know in the proof of the above theorem, where have we assumed any facts about $\textbf{PID}$ .

Question b, asks to prove that the length of the segment of the tangent of the tractrix between the point of tangency and the y axis is constantly 1.

Here W is the lambertW function, $e$ is $\exp(1)$ and 'scaled' in 'scaled truncated taylor series of exp' means the following: say if $$s_5(x) = 1+x+x^2/2+x^3/6+x^4/24+x^5/120$$ is the 'truncated taylor series of exp' of degree 5 then we will look at $s_5(5x)$ so we are looking at $s_n(nx)$  in general. Here is a plot for the case $n=33$ (it only works for uneven $n$).
Using the lambert W function comes from formula (1.1) from paper 221 available from here .

51596,"If $f'$ tends to a positive limit as $x$ approaches infinity, then $f$ approaches infinity","Some time ago, I asked this here. A restricted form of the second question could be this: If $f$ is a function with continuous first derivative in $\mathbb{R}$ and such that $$\lim_{x\to \infty} f'(x) =a,$$ with $a\gt 0$, then $$\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\infty.$$ To prove it, I tried this: There exist $x_0\in \mathbb{R}$ such that for $x\geq x_0$,
$$f'(x)\gt \frac{a}{2}.$$
There exist $\delta_0\gt 0$ such that for $x_0\lt x\leq x_0+ \delta_0$
$$\begin{align*}\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}-f'(x_0)&\gt -\frac{a}{4}\\
\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}&\gt f'(x_0)-\frac{a}{4}\\
&\gt \frac{a}{2}-\frac{a}{4}=\frac{a}{4}\\
f(x)-f(x_0)&\gt \frac{a}{4}(x-x_0)\end{align*}.$$
We can assume that $\delta_0\geq 1$. If $\delta_0 \lt 1$, then $x_0+2-\delta_0\gt x_0$ and then $$f'(x_0+2-\delta_0)\gt \frac{a}{2}.$$
Now, there exist $\delta\gt 0$ such that for $x_0+2-\delta_0\lt x\leq x_0+2-\delta_0+\delta$ $$f(x)-f(x_0+2-\delta_0)\gt \frac{a}{4}(x-(x_0+2-\delta_0))= \frac{a}{4}(x-x_0-(2-\delta_0))\gt \frac{a}{4}(x-x_0).$$ It is clear that $x\in (x_0,x_0+2-\delta_0+\delta]$ and $2-\delta_0+\delta\geq 1$. Therefore, we can take $x_1=x_0+1$. Then $f'(x_1)\gt a/2$ and then there exist $\delta_1\geq 1$ such that for $x_1\lt x\leq x_1+\delta_1$ $$f(x)-f(x_1)\gt \frac{a}{4}(x-x_1).$$
Take $x_2=x_1+1$ and so on. If $f$ is bounded, $(f(x_n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a increasing bounded sequence and therefore it has a convergent subsequence. Thus, this implies that the sequence $(x_n)$:
$$x_{n+1}=x_n+1,$$ have a Cauchy's subsequence and that is a contradiction. Therefore $\lim_{x\to \infty} f(x)=\infty$. I want to know if this is correct, and if there is a simpler way to prove this. Thanks.","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

$$A_n = \left[ 1 - \beta_n A_{n+1} \right]^{-1} \alpha_n$$ I know that $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} A_n = 0$, so a way to calculate $A_1$ is to start at some cutoff $N$ and evaluate $A_1$ up to that value, and then to re-calculate it for a larger cutoff $N$ until the change in the result is sufficiently small. What I do not like about this approach is that I cannot reuse intermediate results from smaller cutoffs when I calculate the result for the larger cutoff. I know that for ordinary (i.e. scalar) continued fractions, there is the modified Lentz's version as described in Numerical Recipes and I wondered if I there is a similar method for my matrix-valued example. In case it helps, maybe some information regarding the matrices $\alpha_n$ and $\beta_n$. They are sparse They are not square matrices, with $\alpha_n$ having more columns than rows and $\beta_n$ having more rows than columns. Motivation: I work on an implementation/refinement on a neat method to compute lattice Green's functions as given in the following reference. Berciu, M., & Cook, A. M. (2010). Efficient computation of lattice Greenʼs functions for models with nearest-neighbour hopping. EPL (Europhysics Letters) , 92(4), 40003 Without much detail: We have quantities $G(n_x,n_y)$ and for these we have coupled recurrence relations that link quantities where one of the two arguments gets reduced or increased by 1. Noting that the relations couple quantities that differ in $M := n_x + n_y$ by $\pm 1$, we can define vectors 
$V_M$ that contain all quantities $G(n_x, n_z)$ with $n_x + n_y = M = const$, and then the recurrence relations can be written in matrix form as 
$$V_M = \alpha_M V_{M-1} + \beta_M V_{M+1}$$
Some physicla arguments demand that $V_M = 0$ for very large $M$, and using this as a hard cut-off, we can write $V_M = A_M V_{M-1}$ where $A_M$ is given by the recurrence relation I mention above. If I choose the cut-off by hand, I can compute the result, in the same way that I could compute a normal continued fraction approximatively by just computing the $n$-th convergent for a large $n$. But I am interested in having a cut-off that automatically ensures that the calculation actually converged.","['matrices', 'continued-fractions', 'numerical-methods']"

The camera's final position is 9758.8 km from the planet, or 2 Blender units . The camera's start position is 45999102.0 km from the planet, which is too many Blender units (9427.2). Problem Scale the planet's radius to simulate how it would appear at a given distance from the camera. Progress The angular diameter of the object can be calculated using: $δ = 2 \times arctan( r / D )$ Where: δ is the angular diameter; r is the radius; and D is the distance. Plugging the numbers: δ = 2 arctan( 2439.70 / 45999102 )
  = 0.0001060759 radians Update #1 I think I can use the following: The distance to the camera (adjacent side) is 9758.8 km. Since $tan(δ) = opposite \over adjacent$, then $opposite = adjacent \times tan(δ)$. Thus o = 9758.8 km tan( δ )
  = 9758.8 km tan( 0.0001060759 )
  = 1.035 km Update #2 So at a distance of 45999102 km, the apparent size of a sphere with a 2439.70 km diameter would be 1.035 km at a distance of 9758.8 km.

By inversion, sending $x \to \frac{1}{x}$ one could exchange $0\leftrightarrows\infty$; then if the values of the derivatives of a function are finite at infinity I was wondering if it is possible to give some sense to $(x-\infty)^n$ in order to define the ""Taylor expansion of a function ad infinity"".",['analysis']
51772,Uniqueness of the derivative in locally convex topological vector space,"I need a hint of proof of uniqueness of the derivative in locally convex topological vector space (it's asserted in Lang's ""Introduction to differentiable manifolds""). Define derivative of a function $f: E \to F$ between two topological vector spaces at the point $x_0$ as a linear operator $f'(x_0) \in L(E, F)$ such that ${}^2\!\!f(y) := f(x_0 + y) - f(x_0) - f'(x_0) y$ is tangent to zero (a function $\varphi$ is tangent to zero if for any neighborhood of zero $W \subset F$ there exists a neighborhood of zero $V \subset E$ such that $\varphi(tV) = o(t)W$). Now suppose that two operators $A_1$ and $A_2$ satisfy the condition of the derviative. I need to prove then that $A_1 = A_2$. It is easy to see that there must be a neighborhood of zero $V \subset E$ such that $(A_1 - A_2)V = 0$, so we have $\operatorname{span}V \subset \ker (A_1 - A_2) \subset E$, so it is sufficient to prove that $\operatorname{span}V = E$. In case of Banach space it is very easy (any non-empty open set must contain a ball), but in a more general case it seems that this attempt fails (consider a discrete space), and I can't see another strategy. Is the derivative in fact unique or is some condition stronger than what is stated required for it to be unique?","['topological-vector-spaces', 'locally-convex-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
51778,how to properly calculate difference in percent,"Suppose, you have x=8
y=10 Then y is 25% more than x, if x is used as the ""base"" value. If y ist the base, then x is 20% less than y. So if I want to say, that the difference between x and y is ... percent, what value could I use? I can think of using 22.5% being in the middle between 20% and 25%, but that does not feel well-founded. Should I not use percentages at all?",['statistics']
51779,Looking for an article on general principles of discrete mathematics,"In his article 2 cultures Timothy Gowers states that the structure in combinatorics is there in the form of somewhat vague general statements that allow proofs to be condensed in the mind, and therefore more easily memorized and more easily transmitted
  to others. I just started to learn combinatorics, or, more generally, discrete mathematics, and would like to know if there is such a thing as a list of these general statements/ principles somewhere, preferably in the form of a (freely available) article with lots of examples. So far my problem is that I do not know what tools exist and how to possibly apply them to problems. This results in me trying to solve problems of discrete mathematics with more or less bare hands. To give you an idea of what I'm looking for I shall present some examples myself (please note: I came up with some of the principles myself, so they might be inaccurate. If they are, please point this out): When trying to prove a certain equality combinatorically, one tries to show that both sites of the equality are the cardinality of one set. Doing so, sums are related to partitions of sets, products are related to products of sets and binomial coefficients tell you that this set has something to do with choosing elements from some other set. To prove the existence of 'big' subgraphs with certain features of some graph $G$ which has certain (other) properties, it can help to look at maximal or maximum subgraphs with certain properties.  
For example, to show that every $k$-regular graph $G$ has as a subgraph a circle of size at least $k + 1~$ just look at a maximal path in $G$. Pick one of its endpoints, observe that the neighbours of it must all be on the path and now you're done because the part of the path up to the ultimate neighbour of your endpoint together with the edge connecting it with the endpoint is a circle that meets the required criterion I hope you got an idea of what I am looking for: a list of principles together with examples of how and in which situations to apply these principles helping me to tackle combinatorical problems and to get a better understanding of the field as a whole. Just to make sure you do not get me wrong: I am not expecting to get a list which enables me to solve many problems just by looking at the appropriate entry of that list and applying what's written there. This list is supposed to be like a toolbox which someone shows (lends) to me with some hints on how to possibly use these tools, so that I can go out and try them out at different problems seeing where I succeed and where I do not.","['intuition', 'discrete-mathematics', 'reference-request', 'combinatorics']"

51819,Understanding of the Mean Value Theorem in PDE,"I learned the following theorem in Folland's Introduction to Partial Differential Equations (p.69 Chapter 2): Suppose $u$ is harmonic on an open set $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^n$. If $x\in\Omega$ and $r>0$  is small enough so that $\overline{B_r(x)}\subset\Omega$, then
  $$u(x)=\frac{1}{r^{n-1}\omega_n}\int_{S_r(x)}u(y)d\sigma(y)=\frac{1}{\omega_n}\int_{S_1(0)}u(x+ry)d\sigma(y)，$$
  where $$\omega_n=\frac{2\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2)}.$$ I found that I could not immediately reconstruct a proof for the theorem. A key point is that one needs to use the Green's identity, which is a basic property of harmonic functions. But I don't see any ""clue"" that how people actually come up with this theorem and such proof. (Maybe this is the common problem, at least for me, for most of the textbooks.) A curious search in Google returns nothing satisfactory to me. Since this is a basic property of harmonic functions , I am wondering that if one needs to know this history of harmonic functions in order to know this theorem well. Here is my question: Can any one here come up with a motivation of this theorem in PDE? My second question may be more vague: How can I approach the proof of this theorem more ""naturally"" instead of just remembering bunch of facts ? (In the language of Polya, any heuristics here?)","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-differential-equations', 'soft-question', 'math-history']"
51846,General Definition of Likelihood Function,"I am wondering if there is a way of generalizing the likelihood function of some parameters $L(\theta | \mathbf x), \theta \in \Theta$ given some data $\mathbf x$ that has been observed coming from a distribution on $\mathbb R^n$, say $\mu$, so that it is defined for distributions that admit neither a density nor mass function. I guess something rooted in measure theory that preserves the relevant properties of likelihood functions would be desired (e.g. under suitable regularity conditions it would be desirable for asymptotic normality and consistency of maximum likelihood estimators to hold). My only thought is that we may be able to generalize the notion so long as the distribution of the data admits some density with respect to some measure other than Lebesgue or counting measure.",['statistics']
