44700,The $p$-adic expansion of a function of $p$,"Let $p\neq 2$ be prime. I am asked in a revision question to find the $p$-adic expansion of $(1+2p)/(p-p^3)$. The best I could do was find the $p$-adic norm, which I got as $p$ (please correct me if this is wrong) thus giving the expansion as
$$
\frac{1+2p}{p-p^3} = a_{-1}p^{-1} + a_0 + a_1 p + \dots

44715,"Why does the ring $A$ need to be commutative for $Hom_A(X,X')$ to be an $A$-module?","Refer to Lang's ""Algebra"" second paragraph from top, p. 122.
Let $A$ be a ring and $X$, $X^'$ be $A$-modules. 
Let $Hom_A(X,X')$ be the set of $A$-homomorphisms from $X$ to $X'$.
It is mentioned that if $A$ is commutative, then we can
make $Hom_A(X,X')$ into an $A$-module by defining
$(\alpha f)(x) = \alpha f(x)$ for $\alpha \in A$, $f \in Hom_A(X,X')$
and $x \in X$, whereas if $A$ is not commutative, then we can only
regard $Hom_A(X,X')$ as an abelian group. The question is: why do we 
need the commutativity property to have a well-defined operation of $A$
on $Hom_A(X,X')$ as above? What goes wrong if we remove commutativity?","['modules', 'abstract-algebra']"
44731,Using induction on a sequence,"I have a problem where I am asked to use induction to show that for the sequence defined as $x_1=1$, $x_{n+1}=\frac{3x_n+4}{4}$ the upper bound is $<4$. I was thinking of a following way. Assume that for some $n+1$, $\frac{3x_n+4}{4} \geq 4$. Then we get $x_n \geq 4$. Repeating the process until we get to $x_1$, we get $x_1 \geq 4$, but it was defined to be equal to one, so we get a contradiction, thus the bound is indeed $<4$. However, I don't think this 'counts' as induction -- could you please show me an inductive way of approaching this problem? Many thanks! Edit: I am thinking of the following: base case -- when n=1, we get $\frac{7}{4}$ which is less than 4. Now let's show that when this holds for $x_n$, it holds for $x_{n+1}$. $x_{n+1} = \frac{3x_n+4}{4} = 1 + \frac{3}{4} x_n$. But we know $x_n < 4$, so the whole expression must be less than 1+3=4.

44811,How does the boundary property usually work in PDE?,"This may be related to the question Is the hypersurface of class $C^k$ a $C^k$-differentiable manifold? . In almost every chapter of a PDE textbook(e.g. Folland's Introduction to Partial Differential Equations ), the boundary of the domain is assumed to have some properties. The most common assumption is about the "" smoothness ""(I call it so, whether appropriate or not). For example, in Chapter 3 in Folland's book, there is a sentence as following: ""In this chapter $\Omega$ will be a fixed bounded domain in ${\mathbb R}^n$ with $C^2$ boundary $S$,..."" It seems that this assumption is always used implicitly . I can never understand how it actually work. I can only know superficially that $C^2$ means the coordinates charts are $C^2$-compatible in the definition of differentiable structure. Nothing more. Is there a rule of thumb that how this assumption is used? It may be too vague to ask such question without a concrete proposition/theorem which has such assumption.

44817,The motion of a system as a level set of the energy,"Suppose we have a mechanical system with 1 degree of freedom, i.e. an ODE $$(1)\quad \ddot{q}+V^\prime(q)=0, $$ where $V \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is some smooth function ( potential energy ). We then easily see that any solution of this equation must satisfy $$\frac{\dot{q}^2}{2} + V(q)=\text{constant}.$$ In other words, if we put $$E(q, \dot{q})=\frac{\dot{q}^2}{2} + V(q)$$ ( energy ), then the image of every solution of (1) must lie in a level set of $E$. Question Can it be that a solution of (1) is projected properly in a connected level set of the energy? More formally, can there exist a function $u \colon I \to \mathbb{R}$ that solves (1) and such that the set $$T_u=\{(u(t), \dot{u}(t)) \mid t \in I\}$$ is a proper subset of $$E_u=\{(a, b) \in \mathbb{R}^2\mid E(a, b)=E(u_0, \dot{u}_0)\}?$$ Of course $I$ must be the maximal interval of existance for the solution $u$. Require also $E_u$ to be connected (thanks to AlbertH who pointed this out). By physical considerations I guess that this cannot happen. Also, I found in some physics textbooks phrases like: ""finding the level sets of the energy is equivalent to finding the trajectories of the system"", which corroborate this conjecture. I'm not necessarily after a fully rigorous answer. Even a good intuition will suffice. Thank you.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'classical-mechanics', 'physics']"

44850,Locally Constant Functions on Connected Spaces are Constant,"I am trying to show that a function that is locally constant on a connected space is, in fact, constant. I have looked at this related question but my approach is a little different than the suggested approach and I'm unsure about the final step and would appreciate a tip. Here is what I have so far: Let $f$ be a locally constant function on the connected space $U$. Assume that $f$ is not constant. Then, there are distinct points $x$ and $y$ such that $f(x) \neq f(y)$. Now, since $f$ is locally constant there are neighborhoods $V_x$ of $x$ and $V_y$ of $y$ such that $$
f(V_x) = k_x, \;\; f(V_y) = k_y
$$
for some constants $k_x \neq k_y$ .It follows that $V_x \cap V_y =\emptyset$ Now, let $A = U-V_x \cup V_y$ and $B = V_x \cup V_y$ so that $U = A \cup B$. With this, we have expressed $U$ as a union of disjoint sets. Since $V_x$ and $V_y$ are open $B$ is open. Note that if $A$ is empty we are done because $V_x$ and $V_y$ would comprise a separation of $U$ wich would imply that the assumption about f being not constant was faulty. So, assume $A$ is nonempty. At this point, I want to show that $A$ itself is open. If I can do this, I believe the proof will be complete. One way I've thought about doing this is to choose a neigborhood of some point $a \in A$ and if it is not already disjoint from $B$, shrink it until it is. This would then demonstrate that $A$ is open. Am I on the right track here?","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"

Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 3 years ago . Improve this question Is a circle more impossible than any other geometrical shape? Is a circle is just an infinitely-sided equilateral parallelogram? Wikipedia says... A circle is a simple shape of Euclidean geometry consisting of the set of points in a plane that are a given distance from a given point, the centre. The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius. A geometric plane would need to have an infinite number of points in order to represent a circle, whereas, say, a square could actually be represented with a finite number of points, in which case any geometric calculations involving circles would involve similarly infinitely precise numbers(pi, for example). So when someone speaks of a circle as something other than a theory, are they really talking about a [ really big number ]-sided equilateral parallelogram?

44907,"What's going on with ""compact implies sequentially compact""?","I've seen both counterexamples and proofs to ""compact implies sequentially compact"", and I'm not sure what's going on. Apparently there are compact spaces which are not sequentially compact; quick googling and wikipedia checks will turn up examples floating around; they tend to be variants of $[0,1]^{[0,1]}$ with the product topology.  Here's a demonstration(?): $[0,1]^{[0,1]}$ is compact by Tychonoff's theorem.  So, we demonstrate failure of sequential compactness. Choose a unique binary representation for each $x\in [0,1]$ . For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , let $f_n : [0,1]\to[0,1]$ (an element of $[0,1]^{[0,1]}$ ) be the function which maps each $x$ to its $n$ -th place digit in its binary expansion. Let $f_{n_k}$ be a subsequence of this sequence. Let $x'\in [0,1]$ be such that the $n_{2m}$ -th digit is $0$ and the $n_{2m+1}$ -th digit is $1$ , for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$ . Then $f_{n_k} (x')$ does not converge (it alternates between $0$ and $1$ ), and hence $f_{n_k}$ cannot converge. Thus we have found a sequence in $[0,1]^{[0,1]}$ without any convergent subsequence and so it is not sequentially compact. (Aside: this is apparently based off of an example in Steen's Counterexamples in Topology, according to http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sequentially+compact+space ) Nevertheless, there's also some proofs(?) floating around that compactness of a space implies sequential compactness, along these lines (this proof(?) is of the contrapositive): Suppose $X$ is not sequentially compact. By definition, this means there is some sequence $(x_n)$ over $X$ with no convergent subsequence. If any $x\in X$ had for each of its neighborhood $U$ infinitely many $n$ for which $x_n \in U$ , then we could define a convergent subsequence of $(x_n)$ , contradicting our assumption.  (Presumably this is done by choosing for each neighborhood a sufficiently-large-indexed term in that neighborhood.) Thus, for each $x \in X$ we can select an open set $U_x$ such that $x\in U_x$ but with $x_n \in U_x$ for only finitely many $n$ . The collection $\mathcal{U}=\{U_x : x\in X\}$ is clearly an open cover of $X$ . If $\mathcal{U}$ had a finite subcover $\{U_1, \dots, U_k\}$ then the union $U_1 \cup \cdots \cup U_k$ would contain all of $X$ but only contain $x_n$ for finitely many $n$ , which is impossible. Thus $X$ is not compact, since we have found an open cover without a finite subcover. (Aside: this proof is essentially the same as the proof appearing in Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis for Thm 2.37 that infinite subsets of compact spaces have limit points.) So, what's going on here?  It can't be that what both the counterexample and the proof are telling us is correct.  Is there some subtle (or more embarassingly for me -- glaring) flaw in the proof?","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

44922,Monotone convergence theorem of sequences in $\mathbb{R}^n$,"I was trying to extend the monotone convergence theorem for sequences in $\mathbb{R}$ to sequences in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The monotone convergence theorem for sequences in $\mathbb{R}$ is: If $X=(x_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a non-decreasing sequence of real numbers, then the sequence $X$ converges if and only if it is bounded in which case $\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n=\sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} x_{n}$ I think that in the context of $\mathbb{R}^n$, ""non-decreasing"" could mean that the sequence of the norms of the elements is non-decreasing, but it seems to me that this is not sufficient to guarantee convergence.

(word problem supplied to illustrate)","(I had no idea how to tag this, any help would be great) :) I am a programmer with little math experience beyond high school - this will be demonstrated by my explanation. I am developing an application that needs a formula. The formula involves calculating what amounts of food to eat based on factors like calories and concentrations of macronutrients (carbs, protein, fats). Since there are other calculations need that aren't relevant to main problem, I have abstracted it into the following word problem. Here it is: Your job is to keep your store, Colorful Widgets, Inc., supplied with widgets. There are four suppliers that you can order from every month. There is a set ratio of colors that must be met as closely as possible to match sales expectations. The ratio is: Target Color Ratios:
40% Red widgets
40% Blue widgets
20% Yellow widgets The catch is that each supplier offers shipments of mixed colors in different ratios, with each company specializing in one color. Here are the ratios available from the suppliers: Mostly Red Widgets, Inc.
86% Red 
11% Blue 
03% Yellow Acme Widgets, Inc (Limit 3 boxes)
79% Red
09% Blue
20% Yellow Mostly Blue Widgets, Inc.
15% Red
77% Blue
08% Yellow Mostly Yellow Widgets, Inc.
10% Red
00% Blue
90% Yellow All four companies sell their widgets in boxes containing 100 widgets each. Boxes cannot be split into smaller amounts. You need to order 24,000 widgets, with the total ratio of colors matching the targets laid out above. Restrictions: You have a contract with the first three companies - they must be ordered from every month, no exceptions. The fourth (Mostly Yellow Widgets, Inc.) is a stop gap - if your total ratio is low on yellow widgets, you can order from them. Additionally, Acme Widget, Inc. makes the best widgets, but only in limited quantity. You must order 3 boxes from them each ordering cycle. I understand that this problem probably will not have a neat and tidy catch-all formula. Even if there is no formula for this  problem with it's restrictions, there should be a formula or something that will help with the problem of combining three different ratios in such a way to come as close as possible to the target ratio.

However, the author noted that the construction of such a ring ""would take us too far afield"". My question is: please give an example of a division ring $D$ that is not isomorphic to its opposite ring. Let me recall that a division ring is a ring $A$ such that every non-zero element of $A$ is a unit, i.e., has a multiplicative inverse in $A$. However, division rings are not required to be commutative. Let me also recall that if $A$ is a ring, the opposite ring of $A$ is the ring $A^{\text{op}}$ that has the same underlying set as $A$, the same additive structure as $A$, but that the multiplication $*$ on $A^{\text{op}}$ is defined by the rule $a*b=ba$ where ""$ba$"" denotes the product of $b$ and $a$ with respect to the multiplication in $A$. It is not hard to find examples of rings which are not isomorphic to their opposite ring and it is trivial to find examples of noncommutative rings that are isomorphic to their opposite rings. (E.g., the $n\times n$ matrix ring over a field $F$ ($n>1$) is isomorphic to its opposite ring via the transpose map $A\to A^{T}$ where $A$ is a matrix and $A^{T}$ denotes its transpose.) Of course, every commutative ring is isomorphic to its opposite ring via the identity map.

45159,How to calculate the degrees of freedom of an $r$-ranked matrix with the size being $n\times n$?,"Treat matrices as vectors lying in $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. It can be imagined matrices with rank $r (r<n)$ are supposed to lie within a manifold of lower dimension. For example, the singular matrices lie within a $(n^2−1)$-dimensional manifold, because they satisfy $\det(M)=0$, the sole constraint. Typically, the number of independent constraints is equal to the difference between those two dimensions. Alternatively, we call the dimension of that lower-dimensional manifold as ""degrees of freedom"". Now how do we calculate the degrees of freedom of an $r$-ranked matrix with size $n\times n$? The answer says the degrees of freedom is $n^2-(n-r)^2=(2n-r)r$. I try to interpret it as follows:
First, by elementary matrices, every matrix $M$ with the rank of $r$ can be transformed into
$$M\sim\begin{pmatrix}
I_r&0\\
0&0
\end{pmatrix}_{n\times n}$$ Now the constraints come from the block at bottom right, where the entries are suppressed to be zero. So there are $(n-r)^2$ constraints, which lead to the answer (why the number of constraints do not agree with the number of zeroes is because they are not all independent, intuitively). The explanation is not formal at all. Can anyone provide a refined version? Thank you~ EDIT : Provide further explanation of ""degrees of freedom""",['matrices']

Really, it doesn't seem too hard to show this is true for any number p , not just primes.  This gives a nice explicit description of $\mathbb{Z}[[x]]/(x-n)$, when combined with the well known (and hopefully well remembered) facts that $p^k$-adics is just a fancy name for p -adics, and that n -adics in general are the direct product of the p -adics for the distinct primes p dividing n .

45227,The closed graph theorem in topology,"Theorem A map $\phi$ maps a topological space $X$ to another $Y$, where $X$ is Hausdorff, $Y$ is compact and the graph of $\phi$ is closed. Then $\phi$ is continuous. Is it reallly necessary to include the condition that $X$ is Hausdorff?  Since I see no reason, and I appear to have a proof without using the condition, I would like to know the answer. A proof: For any closed subspace $C$ of $Y$, the pre-image $D$ ought to be closed. For any element $a$ in the complement of $D$, we can use the compactness to show that there is a finite number of open sets in $Y$ such that the union of them covers the C, and then the corresponding open sets in $X$ is an open neighborhood of $a$ which has an empty intersection with $D$; so $D$ is closed. P.S. in the proof, those open sets are obtained by the condition that the graph is closed and that $(a,c)$ is not in the graph for any $c$ in $C$.",['general-topology']

45264,Algebraic proof of a trig matrix identity?,"I'll put the question first, and then the background, because I'm not sure that the background is necessary to answer the question: I have a geometric proof, but is there an elegant algebraic proof that $$ \left[ \begin{matrix}-1 & 1 + \cos\frac{\pi}{2n} \\ -2 & 1 + 2\cos\frac{\pi}{2n}\end{matrix} \right] ^n \left[ \begin{matrix}0 \\ 1\end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix}\cot \frac{\pi}{4n} \\ \cot \frac{\pi}{4n}\end{matrix} \right]$$ Background: This is motivated by the latest maths puzzle from Spanish newspaper El País (problem statement there in Spanish, obviously). NB the deadline for submitting solutions to win the prize has passed, so don't worry about cheating. The relevant part of the problem is this: We have two straight lines (in Euclidean geometry) and we wish to draw a zigzag between them. We start at the intersection point and draw a straight line segment of length $r$ along one of the lines (which we shall call the ""horizontal line""). We then draw a straight line segment of length $r$ from the end-point to the other (""non-horizontal"") line. We alternate between the two with straight line segments of the same length, without overlapping or doubling back. The 20th such line segment is perpendicular to the horizontal line. What is the angle between the lines? There's a simple geometric solution (which I shan't state here, in case anyone wants to solve it himself - although I expect that an answer may include spoilers, so if you do want to solve it yourself, look away now), but before finding it I went down an algebraic approach which led me to an equation involving a matrix similar to the one above raised to the 10th power. Basically the equation above is the generalisation to the case with $2n$ line segments and the answer (derived from the geometric proof) substituted for the unknown angle. The question is motivated by little more than curiosity, because I already have a proof. I've tried to prove it myself, but the best I've got so far is a messy expression in terms of some matrices whose powers do have a relatively nice closed form. Filling in some gaps: if the lines intersect at the origin, the horizontal line is along the x-axis, the non-horizontal line is in the first quadrant, and the angle between the lines is $\alpha$, then the points are $P_{2n} = (x_{2n}, x_{2n} \tan \alpha)$ and $P_{2n+1} = (x_{2n+1}, 0)$. Given that the distance between each pair of consecutive points is $r$ we find that $x_{2n}$ and $x_{2n+2}$ are the two roots of $$(z - x_{2n+1})^2 + z^2 \tan^2 \alpha = r^2$$, and we can use the properties of the quadratic equation to get $$x_{2n+2} = \frac{2}{1 + \tan^2 \alpha}x_{2n+1} - x_{2n}$$ By using the symmetry of the triangle formed by $P_{2n+1}$, $P_{2n+2}$, $P_{2n+3}$, we get $$x_{2n+3} = 2x_{2n+2} - x_{2n+1}$$ Putting this all together we can get a recurrence which leads to an expression for $(x_{2n}, x_{2n+1})$ in terms of the nth power of a matrix applied to $(x_{0} = 0, x_{1} = 1)$. Putting any more details risks spoiling the value of $\alpha$. The RHS of the original equation comes from observing that if the $(2n)^{th}$ line segment is perpendicular to the horizontal line, $x_{2n-1} = x_{2n} = x_{2n+1}$ and $\tan \alpha = r / x_{2n}$. The furthest I've got so far with the matrix is to split it out as $$\left(  \cos\frac{\pi}{2n} \left[ \begin{matrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 2\end{matrix} \right] + \left[ \begin{matrix}-1 & 1 \\ -2 & 1\end{matrix} \right] \right)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \left( \begin{matrix}n \\ k\end{matrix} \right) \cos^k\frac{\pi}{2n} \left[ \begin{matrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 2\end{matrix} \right]^k \left[ \begin{matrix}-1 & 1 \\ -2 & 1\end{matrix} \right]^{n-k} $$ where both of the matrix powers on the RHS have closed forms - the markup here doesn't seem to like the URLs and I've taken too long to write this up and need to run, but

45303,How to get 'rectangular size' of arbitrary circular sector?,"Given a circular sector defined by sweeping from a 'start' to a 'stop' angle (see diagram below) and a radius, how do you compute the bounds of the rectangle that fits to the edges of the sector? Additionally, assuming that the top left corner of the rectangle is at (0, 0), where is the center of the arc within the rectangle? The diagram below should clarify all the assumptions in my situation and gives two examples of the sectors I can have. The red rectangle is the rectangle of interest. Please note the particular challenges: Sweeping direction is always clockwise, and sectors can extend past
180 degrees. Naming convention (i.e. 0 degrees is at 3 o'clock) as shown. Angles can wrap around +/- 180 degrees; -10 and 190 are equivalent, but this means that any calculations of angular distances (if needed) need to account for that. For example, with a start angle of 170 and a stop of -170, the angle of the sector is only 20, not -340 (which is what a blind application of 'stop' - 'start' would give you) One final complication: the coordinate system I am working in has the origin at the top left rather than bottom left, so the bottom right corner of the rectangle will have positive x and y coordinates. If anyone's curious, this is for computer graphics in a user interface. The circular sector is actually broken into a 'wheel' of menu options, and I need its size to be able to lay out other UI elements around it.

45380,Continuity of semigroups on $L^2$ and $L^1$: Is this simple proof correct?,"Let $(X, \mu)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space, and $P_t$ a symmetric, Markovian, strongly continuous contraction semigroup on $L^2(X,\mu)$.  ( Markovian means that if $f \in L^2$ with $0 \le f \le 1$, then $0 \le P_t f \le 1$ $\mu$-a.e.  In particular $P_t$ is positivity-preserving.) I would like to show: Claim : $P_t$ is also a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on $L^1$. I have found two proofs of this by Silverstein: In his 1974 book Symmetric Markov processes ( MathSciNet ), there is a somewhat complicated proof (appended below), which appears to be using a generalization of conditional expectation to $\sigma$-finite measure spaces.  Then in Lemma 1.1 of this 1978 paper , there is a simpler proof, but it still uses some specialized uniform integrability results. My proof, which follows, is much simpler, which naturally makes me suspect it.  So I'd be interested in comments. EDIT: Since asking this question, I found that a proof, very similar to my proof below, appears in N. Bouleau and F. Hirsch, Dirichlet Forms and Analysis on Wiener Space ( MathSciNet ) at Propositions 2.2.1 and  2.4.2 Proof. Showing that $P_t$ extends to a contraction semigroup on $L^1$ is easy.  Note that $L^1 \cap L^2$ is dense in $L^1$.  Suppose $f \in L^2 \cap L^1$; we will show $||P_t f||_1 \le ||f||_1$, so that $P_t$ extends continuously to $L^1$.  By the Markovian property it suffices to consider $f \ge 0$.  Let $A_n$ be a sequence of sets with finite measure such that $A_n \uparrow X$; then for each $n$,
$$\int_X (P_t f) 1_{A_n} = \int_X f P_t 1_{A_n} \le \int_X f = ||f||_1$$
since the Markovian property gives $P_t 1_{A_n} \le 1$.  (Edit: The first equality holds because $P_t$ is assumed to be symmetric.)  By monotone convergence, as $n \to \infty$ the right side goes to $\int_X P_t f = ||P_t f||_1$. Now we show the strong continuity.  First let $f \in L^2 \cap L^1$ with $f \ge 0$.  Let $t_n \downarrow 0$.  We have $P_{t_n} f \to f$ in $L^2$; passing to a subsequence we can assume $P_{t_n} f \to f$ a.e.  For each $n$ we have $|P_{t_n} f - f| \le P_{t_n} f + f$, so we mimic the proof of the dominated convergence theorem:
$$\begin{align*}\int_X 2f &= \int \lim \left(f + P_{t_n} f - |P_{t_n} f - f|\right) \\\\
&\le \liminf \left( \int f + \int P_{t_n} f - \int |P_{t_n} f - f| \right) 
&& \text{(Fatou's lemma)}\\\\
&\le \liminf \left( 2 \int f - \int |P_{t_n} f - f| \right) && \text{since }||P_{t_n} f||_1 \le ||f||_1 \\\\
&= 2 \int f - \limsup \int |P_{t_n} f - f|
\end{align*}$$
which, after rearranging, says $\limsup \int |P_{t_n} f - f| = 0$.  We have thus shown $P_t f \to f$ in $L^1$.  Taking positive and negative parts extends this to arbitrary $f \in L^1 \cap L^2$.  Extending to $f \in L^1$ is also easy since $L^2 \cap L^1$ is dense in $L^1$ and each $P_{t_n}$ is a contraction on $L^1$. QED Intuitively, Fatou's lemma says that $L^1$ convergence can only fail when the limiting function has too little mass (it can never have too much).  But the contraction property says that this does not happen. Here is Silverstein's 1974 proof, for reference.  The first line is cut off and says "" Lemma 1.3 .  For $f \in L^1(dx)$"".  (Edit: Incidentally, I'm not able to see why the claimed equality $\mathcal{F}_0 \mathcal{F}_t f(X_0) = P_t (1/P_t 1) P_t f (X_0)$ holds.)","['semigroup-of-operators', 'functional-analysis']"

Right now I'm trying to do Exercise 2.7 from chapter II which reads as follows. Let $f(X, Y, Z) \in K[X, Y, Z]$ be a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d \geq 1$ and assume that the curve $C$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$ given by the equation $F = 0$ is nonsingular. Prove that
    $$
\text{genus}(C) = \frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}
$$ The Exercise has a hint which tells me to define a map $C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$ and use Theorem II.5.9 from that same chapter. For completeness I include the Theorem. Theorem 5.9 (Hurwitz) Let $\phi : C_1 \rightarrow C_2$ be a nonconstant separable map of smooth curves of genera $g_1$ and $g_2$, respectively. Then 
    $$
2g_1 - 2 \geq (\deg{\phi})(2g_2 - 2) + \sum_{P \in C_1} (e_\phi (P) - 1)

My attempts I consider a map $\phi : C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$, which has the form $\phi = [f, g]$ for some $f, g \in K[X, Y, Z]$ homogeneous of the same degree.

$$
2 \text{genus}(C) - 2 = -2\deg{\phi} + \sum_{P \in C} (e_\phi (P) - 1)
$$ so that 
$$
2 \text{genus}(C) = 2 - 2\deg{\phi} + \sum_{P \in C} (e_\phi (P) - 1)
$$ and we have to prove that $2 - 2\deg{\phi} + \sum_{P \in C} (e_\phi (P) - 1) = (d-1)(d-2)$. I have also tried to use the formula from Proposition 2.6 in Chapter II of the book which for this particular case tells us that $$
\sum_{P \in \phi^{-1} (Q)} e_{\phi} (P) = \deg{\phi}
$$ for any point $Q \in \mathbb{P}^1$. Then using this we get $$
2 \text{genus}(C) = 2 - 2\sum_{P \in \phi^{-1} (Q)} e_{\phi} (P) + \sum_{P \in C} (e_\phi (P) - 1)

I'm also wondering how it may be possible to compute those ramification indexes in the sums because I suspect that's were the problem lies. If it is of some help, I know that we can identify any map $\phi : C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$ with a function in $K(C)$ or with the constant map $\infty = [1, 0]$. I was thinking that maybe there's a way for me to get the degree $d$ to come into play here, but up until now I'm stuck and I run out of ideas. Questions So I would very much appreciate some hints and advice as to how to proceed with this exercise. I'm not looking for a full solution but for some advice and hints that may guide me in the right direction. Sorry for the long post, I know that it will not get many people to read it but I'm trying to get the most out of the exercise. Thank you very much for any help.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"
45443,Is there any relation between a group being unimodular and having equivalent uniform structures?,"Recall: A topological group is said to have equivalent uniform structures if its left and right uniform structures coincide.  A locally compact group is said to be unimodular if left Haar measures and right Haar measures on it coincide. For locally compact groups, is there any relation or implication between these two notions?  Abelian groups are trivially both, and compact groups are slightly less trivially both.  Is there anything else that can be said there?","['topological-groups', 'group-theory', 'locally-compact-groups']"

$$\int\nolimits_0^{\infty}{\frac{e^{-ax}-e^{-bx}}{x}\sin{mx} \, dx} \quad (a > 0 \, , b >0)$$ What I did was this
$$ \begin{align}
\int_0^{\infty}{\frac{e^{-ax}-e^{-bx}}{x}\sin{(mx)} \, dx} &= \int_0^{\infty}{\left[\int_a^b{e^{-xy} \, dy}\right]\sin{(mx)} \, dx}\\
&= \int_a^b{\left[\int_0^{\infty}{e^{-xy}\sin{(mx)} \, dx}\right] \, dy}\\
&= \int_a^b{\frac{m}{m^2+y^2} \, dy}\\
&= \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{m}\right) - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{m}\right)
\end{align}$$
So my first question is. Is this procedure ok? Also the book suggests to use parametric differentiation to solve this, but I don't see how to apply it in here, so my second question would be. How can I use parametric differentiation to solve this integral? Any help is appreciated, thanks.","['calculus', 'integration']"
45459,What's wrong in this evaluation $\lim_{x\to\infty}x^{\frac{1}{x}}$ and why combinatorial arguments cannot be made?,"The answers (as well as the premise) of this question have me confused. Please point out the error: $$\displaystyle \lim_{x\to\infty}x^{\frac{1}{x}}=\lim_{x\to\infty}e^{\frac{\log x}{x}} $$ By L' Hospital rule $$   \exp\left( \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\log x}{x}\right) = e^0 =1$$ Three of the answers state an example of the form $x\cdot\frac{c}{x}$, which I can't see how it relates. Combinatorically, $\infty^0$ is the number of mappings from the empty set into a set of size ""infinity"". For a finite and positive $n$, $n^0$ would be the number of mappings from the empty set to a set of cardinality $n$ of which the empty function is the only one. Why does this argument fail? What does it mean to say there is an indeterminate number of mappings, say from the empty set to the set of all natural numbers? I am not familiar with formal set theory (yet) and all I know is that there's something peculiar about infinite cardinalities. So a reference would do in this case if the answer requires knowledge of some theory.",['limits']
45464,Name for resistance to change in data,"Suppose I have two poll questions that can be answered with a Yes or a No with the following results: Poll 1 Yes: $200$ No: $100$ Poll 2 Yes: $2$ No: $1$ Both polls have a $66\%$-$33\%$ split, but getting them to a $50\%$-$50\%$ split is much harder with the first poll than with the second poll. There would have to be $100$ new ""No""s for the first as opposed to $1$ new ""No"" for the second one, two orders of magnitude in difference. Is there a mathematical/statistical name for this ""resistance to change""?","['statistics', 'reference-request']"
