1414933,Find the critical point and show it is not a global minimizer (using Hessian),"Consider the function $f(x,y) = x^3 + e^{3y}-3xe^y$. Show that $f$ has exactly one critical point and that this point is a local minimizer, but not a global minimizer. I have attempted this, but it seems that I have made a mistake somewhere along the way. Can someone please help me find where I went wrong? My attempt: \begin{align}\nabla f = \begin{bmatrix}3x^2 -3e^y \\3e^{3y} -3xe^y\end{bmatrix} = \bar{0}\end{align}
Thus giving the following two homogeneous equations
\begin{align}3x^2 - 3e^y &= 0\\ 3e^{3y} - 3xe^y &=0\end{align} From the second equation we find that $$x = e^{2y}$$ and upon substitution into the first equation we find that $$e^y(e^{3y} -1) =0$$ Notice however that $e^y \neq 0$ and we must that have that $e^{3y}=1 \implies y=0$ and thus $x =1$ Our critical point is thus $(x,y) = (1,0)$. How consider the Hessian \begin{align}H_f &= \begin{bmatrix}6x & -3e^y \\ -3e^y & 9e^{3y}-3xe^y\end{bmatrix}\end{align}
Evaluated at our critical point we obtain $$H = \begin{bmatrix}6 & -3 \\ -3& 6\end{bmatrix}$$ We can then deduce that $H_f$ is positive definite and thus our critical point must be a strict global minimizer.

1414938,Why is this not an inconsistency in elementary Lie theory?,"I made an observation last week, and it has bothered me ever since. Recall the formulae $$\exp([X,Y])=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\exp\left(\frac{1}{n}X\right)\exp\left(\frac{1}{n}Y\right)\exp\left(\frac{-1}{n}X\right)\exp\left(\frac{-1}{n}Y\right)\right)^{n^2}$$ and $$[X,Y]_p(f)=\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{t^2}\Bigg(f\Big(\!\exp(-tY)\exp(-tX)\exp(tY)\exp(tX)p\Big)-f(p)\Bigg).$$ The observation is this: the first formula ""moves clockwise"", while the second formula ""moves counterclockwise""! This led me back to definitions. Suppose we have a Lie group $G$ and we want to define the Lie algebra of $G$. We can define the Lie algebra using the adjoint representation, with $X_e,Y_e\in T_eG$ and $$[X_e,Y_e]=\mathrm{ad}_{X_e}(Y_e)=\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{t}(L_{\exp(tX_e)*}R_{\exp(-tX_e)*}Y_e-Y_e),$$ or with left-invariant vector fields $X$ and $Y$ with $$[X,Y]_e=\mathcal{L}_X(Y)_e=\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}(\exp(-tX)_*Y_{\exp(tX)e}-Y_e).$$ I believe that I am much less proficient in the latter than the former, so perhaps this stems from lack of practice, but it looks like these are not the same Lie algebra, in the sense that the identity map on $T_eG$ is not a Lie algebra isomorphism. In fact, it looks like the identity map would be an anti -isomorphism, so that $[X_e,Y_e]=-[X,Y]_e$. Of course, anti-isomorphic Lie algebras are isomorphic, but they are not ""the same"" in the sense above. Today, I tested this on the matrix Lie group $\left\{\begin{bmatrix}a & b \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\!:a,b\in\mathbb{R}\text{ and } a>0\right\}$, but they came out to the same algebra. Why do these two definitions ""move in opposite directions"" in the sense above, and how do they determine the same Lie algebra?

Is the following proof correct? Proof: Let $E$ be the set of all Lebesgue numbers of $C$, that is for each $\epsilon \in E$, for all $x$, $B(x, \epsilon)$ is contained in some $U_\alpha$. The cover $C$ has a maximum Lebegue number if $\sup E$ exists and is contained in $E$.
Since $X$ is compact and since $C$ is finite there exists some $M > 0$ such that all $U_\alpha$ are bounded by $M$ which implies $E$ is bounded above by $M$. Thus $\sup E$ exists. To show $\sup E \in E$ consider sequence $r_n \in E$ that converges to $\sup E$. For each $r_n$ there is some $U_\alpha$ such that $B(x, r_n) \subseteq U_\alpha$ Thus for all $x \in X$ the union $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}B(x, r_n) = B(x, \sup E) \subseteq U_\alpha$ which makes $\sup E$ a Lebesgue number by definition. $\square$ This relies on the fact that the union of all balls less than radius $r$ around $x$ is equal to $B(x, r)$ which can be shown easily.","['metric-spaces', 'real-analysis', 'general-topology']"

1415147,Perturb a piecewise-linear path to make it $C^\infty$,"I'm trying to prove that any two points on a path connected smooth manifold can be joined by a smooth path. It becomes easy if I can prove the following: Given a curve $\gamma :\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ that is

But instead I got by calculating by hand: $$x(t)=\frac{1}{4}t^2-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{9}{8}\cos{2t}+\sin{2t}$$ Here's how I got it.  The Laplace transform of the differential equation is: $$s^2X(s)-sx(0)-x'(0)+4X(s)=\frac{2}{s^3}$$ Since $x(0)=1$ and $x'(0)=2$: $$s^2X(s)-s-2+4X(s)=\frac{2}{s^3}$$ Solving for $X(s)$: $$X(s)=\frac{s^4+2s^3+2}{s^3(s^2+4)}=\frac{s^4+2s^3+2}{s^3(s+j2)(s-j2)}$$ Breaking it up into partial fractions: $$X(s)=\frac{A}{s^3}+\frac{B}{s^2}+\frac{C}{s}+\frac{D}{s+j2}+\frac{E}{s-j2}$$ Solving for the coefficients: $$
\begin{align}
A &= s^3X(s)|_{s=0} = \frac{1}{2} \\
D &= (s+j2)X(s)|_{s=-j2} = \frac{9}{16}+j\frac{1}{2} \\
E &= (s-j2)X(s)|_{s=j2} = \frac{9}{16}-j\frac{1}{2} \\
\end{align}
$$ But this part is where I think I calculated wrong but couldn't figure out why: $$
\begin{align}
B &= [\frac{d}{ds}s^3X(s)]_{s=0} = \frac{d}{ds}(\frac{s^4+2s^3+2}{s^2+4})|_{s=0}\\
&=\frac{(4s^3+6s^2)(s^2+4)-(s^4+2s^3+2)(2s)}{(s^2+4)^2}|_{s=0} \\ &=\frac{2s^5+2s^4+16s^3+24s^2-4s}{s^4+8s^2+16}|_{s=0} = 0 
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
C &= [\frac{d^2}{ds^2}s^3X(s)]_{s=0}=\frac{d}{ds}\frac{2s^5+2s^4+16s^3+24s^2-4s}{s^4+8s^2+16}|_{s=0} \\
&= \frac{(10s^4+8s^3+48s^2+48s-4)(s^4+8s^2+16)-(2s^5+2s^4+16s^3+24s^2-4s)(4s^3+16s)}{(s^4+8s^2+16)^2}|_{s=0} \\
&= \frac{(-4)(16)}{(16)^2} = \frac{-1}{4}
\end{align}
$$
Substituting in the coefficients:
$$X(s)=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{s^3}-\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{s}+(\frac{9}{16}+j\frac{1}{2})\cdot\frac{1}{s+j2}+(\frac{9}{16}-j\frac{1}{2})\cdot\frac{1}{s-j2}$$
Then do inverse Laplace transform:
$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \frac{1}{4}t^2-\frac{1}{4}+(\frac{9}{16}+j\frac{1}{2})e^{-j2t}+(\frac{9}{16}-j\frac{1}{2})e^{j2t}\\
&= \frac{1}{4}t^2-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{9}{8}(\frac{e^{j2t}+e^{-j2t}}{2})+(\frac{e^{j2t}-e^{-j2t}}{j2})\\
&=\frac{1}{4}t^2-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{9}{8}\cos{2t}+\sin{2t}

1415314,"Folland, Real Analysis problem 1.18","This comes from an exercise from Real Analysis by Folland. Let $\mathcal{A}\subset P(X)$ be an algebra, $\mathcal{A}_\sigma$ the collection of countable unions of sets in $\mathcal{A}$ , and $\mathcal{A}_{\sigma\delta}$ the collection of countable intersections of sets in $\mathcal{A}_\sigma$ . Let $\mu_{0}$ be a premeasure on $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mu^*$ the induced outer measure. a.) For any $E\subset X$ and $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $A\in \mathcal{A}_\sigma$ with $E\subset A$ and $\mu^*(A) \leq \mu^*(E) + \epsilon$ . b.) If $\mu^{*}(E) < \infty$ , then $E$ is $\mu^{*}$ -measurable if and only if there exists $B\in A_{\sigma\delta}$ with $E\subset B$ and $\mu^{*}(B\setminus E) = 0$ c.) If $\mu_0$ is $\sigma$ -finite, the restriction $\mu^{*}(E) < \infty$ in (b) is superfluous proof a.): By the definition of outermeasure we know that $$\mu^{*}(E) = \inf\left\{ \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \mu_{0} ( A_{j} ) : A_{j} \in \mathcal{A}, E \subset \bigcup_{j=1}^{\infty} A_{j} \right \}$$ Let $A = \bigcup_{j=1}^{\infty} A_{j}$ as above. Then $A \in \mathcal{A}_{\sigma}$ and $E \subset A$ . For each $j$ we can construct a sequence $\{ B_{j}^{k} \} _{k=1}^{\infty}\subset \mathcal{A}$ such that $A_j\subset \bigcup_{j,k=1}^{\infty}B_{j}^{k}$ . It follows that since $$\mu^{*}(A_j) = \inf\left\{ \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \mu_{0} (B_{j}^{k} ) : B_{j}^{k} \in \mathcal{A}, A_j \subset \bigcup_{j,k=1}^{\infty} B_{j}^{k} \right \}$$ We have that, $$\mu^{*}(A_{j}) \leq \mu_{0}(A_{j}) + \epsilon 2^{-j}, \forall j \ \ \text{and} \ \ \epsilon>0$$ Thus: $$\mu^{*}(A) \leq  \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \mu^{*} ( A_{j} ) \leq \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} ( \mu_{0}(A_{j}) + \epsilon 2^{-j}) = \mu^{*}(E) + \epsilon$$ Since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary we are done. b.) Suppose $E$ is $\mu^{*}$ -measurable. From part (a), we know that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists $B_n\in A_\sigma$ with $E\subset B_n$ and $\mu^{*}(B_n) - \mu^{*}(E) \leq 1/n$ . Let, $$B = \bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty}B_n\in A_\sigma$$ since E is $\mu^{*}$ -measurable, we have $\mu^{*}(B_n) = \mu^{*}(B_n\cap E) + \mu^{*}(B_n\cap E^{c})$ hence, $$\mu^{*}(B\cap E^{c})\leq \mu^{*}(B_n\cap E^{c})= \mu^{*}(B_n) - \mu^{*}(E)\leq 1/n$$ for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . Hence we have $\mu^{*}(B\setminus E) = 0$ \ To show the converse, let's suppose $B\in A_{\sigma\delta}$ with $E\subset B$ and $\mu^{*}(B\setminus E) = 0$ . From part (a), we know that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists $A_n\in A_\sigma$ with $(B\setminus E)\subset A_n$ and $\mu^{*}(A_n) - \mu^{*}(B\setminus E)\leq 1/n$ . But, since $\mu^{*}(B\setminus E) = 0$ then, $\mu^{*}(A_n)\leq 1/n$ . Let, $$A = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n$$ then A is $\mu^{*}$ -measurable (since $A\in A_{\sigma\delta}$ and the set of all $\mu^{*}$ -measurable sets is a $\sigma$ -algebra) such that $(B\setminus E)\subset A$ and $\mu^{*}(A) = 0$ .\ By Carathedors's theorem we know that the restriction of $\mu^{*}$ to $\mu^{*}$ -measurable sets is a complete measure. From this, we know that $(B\setminus E)$ is $\mu^{*}$ -measurable. Also, since $B\in A_{\sigma\delta}$ then $B$ is also $\mu^{*}$ -measurable and we can express $E$ as $$E = (B^{c}\cup (B\cap E^{c}))^{c}$$ Thus $E$ is $\mu^{*}$ -measurable. c.) Let $\mu_0$ be $\sigma$ -finite, then let $$X = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}X_i$$ where $X_i\in M$ and $\mu(X_i) < \infty$ Now, suppose $E$ is $\mu^{*}$ -measurable and $\mu^{*}(E) = \infty$ , set $$E_n = (E\cap \bigcup_{1}^{n}X_i)$$ then $\mu^{*}(E_n) < \infty$ and $E = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_n$ .

1415641,Prove that $R$ is an integral domain $\Leftrightarrow$ $R[x]$ is an integral domain,"Here is an exercise(p.129, ex.1.15) from Algebra: Chapter 0 by P.Aluffi. Prove that $R[x]$ is an integral domain if and only if $R$ is an integral domain. The implication part makes no problems, because $R$ is a subring of $R[x]$.
For the ''if'' part, however.. Let $R$ be an integral domain. 
Now let's review pairs $f(x)=\sum \nolimits a_ix^i,g(x)= \sum \nolimits b_ix_i \in R[x]$ such that $f(x)g(x) = 0$
So, we have $\sum \limits_{k=0}^{\infty} \sum \nolimits_{i+j=k} a_ib_jx^{i+j} = 0$. Now, I'm not sure how to deduce that $f(x) = 0 \vee g(x) = 0$ If I look at $f(x),g(x)$ such that, for example, $deg((f(x))=3, deg((g(x))=2)$, it makes sense. I begin by something like that ""if $f(x)g(x)=0$ then $a_0b_0=0$ then $a_0 = 0 \vee b_0 = 0$. If $a_0 =0 $, then $a_0b_1 = a_0b_2 = 0$"" and so on.

$(\forall k \in \mathbb{N} \sum \nolimits_{i+j=k} a_ib_j = 0)(1) \Rightarrow ((\forall n \in \mathbb{N} \ \ a_n = 0) \vee (\forall m \in \mathbb{N} \ \ b_m = 0))(2)$ We can say that $(1)$ is a system of equations in $R$.

\mu(\{x:|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|\geq\varepsilon\})\to0 \text{ as } n\to \infty

My reference material uses a proof via the dirac measure, which I don't yet understand. Maybe in addition to checking my proof for correctness, someone could also address my difficulties with the dirac way, which I will state at the end of my post.
In the following, $\mathbb{K}$ will be the underlying field, i.e. $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. So let $(f_n)_n\subset\mathscr{C}([0,1])$ such that $f_n \overset{w}\rightarrow f$, where $f \in \mathscr{C}([0,1])$. This is my proof, and I would like to know whether it is correct:
 For every $y \in [0,1]$, I define the operator $$\Phi_y: span\{f_n-f\lvert n \in \mathbb{N}\} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_i(f_i-f) \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_i(f_i-f)(y)$$ Then for any functions $g,h$ in the span, and $\mu \in \mathbb{K}$, we have $$\Phi_y(g+\mu h)=\Phi_y\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N_g}\lambda_i^g(f_i-f)+\mu \sum_{i=1}^{N_h}\lambda_i^h(f_i-f)\right)=\Phi_y\left(\sum_{i=1}^{\max\{N_g,N_h\}}(\lambda_i^g+\mu\lambda_i^h)(f_i-f)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{\max\{N_g,N_h\}}(\lambda_i^g+\mu\lambda_i^h)(f_i-f)(y)=\sum_{i=1}^{\max\{N_g,N_h\}}\lambda_i^g(f_i-f)(y)+\sum_{i=1}^{\max\{N_g,N_h\}}\mu\lambda_i^h(f_i-f)(y)$$$$=\Phi_y(g)+\mu \Phi_y(h)$$ providing linearity.
We also have $$\lvert\Phi_y(g)\rvert=\lvert\sum_{i=1}^{N_g}\lambda_i^g(f_i-f)(y)\rvert\le\sup_{x \in [0,1]}\lvert\sum_{i=1}^{N_g}\lambda_i^g(f_i-f)(x)\rvert=\lvert\lvert g\rvert\rvert_{\infty}$$
So each $\Phi_y$ is linear on the span, which is a subspace of $\mathscr{C}([0,1])$, and also bounded by the norm.
By Hahn-Banach then follows that we have an extension of each $\Phi_y$ on the continuous dual of $\mathscr{C}([0,1])$, and weak convergence gives $$f_n(y)-f(y)=(f_n-f)(y)=\Phi_y(f_n-f)\rightarrow 0$$ for all y in [0,1], which was to be proven. The alternative proof in my notes goes like this:
$f_n \overset{w}\rightarrow f \implies \forall \text{finite measures on [0,1] with the Borel algebra}: \lvert \int f_n d\mu-\int f d\mu\rvert \rightarrow 0 \overset{\text{dirac measure}}\implies \forall x \in [0,1] \lvert f_n(x)-f(x)\rvert \rightarrow 0$ I do not know what is used in the first step, are all integrals over the whole interval [0,1] over* finite measures continuous functionals?

1416213,A question about the formulation of the definition of a limit for sequences,"So I know the definition of a limit of a the sequence is: $a$ is a limit of a sequence $\{x_n\}$ if given $\epsilon>0$ there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $|x_n-a|<\epsilon$ for all $n \geq N$. My question is, why does the order of stating given $\epsilon>0$ there exists... matter. In other words, why can we not say there a exists a positive integer $N$ such that given $\epsilon>0$... In other words, one $N$ value can work for all values of $\epsilon$ because if it works for an arbitrarily small real number then surely it works for all real numbers arbitrarily bigger than it? Thus making defining a different $N$ value for each $\epsilon$ unnecessary.","['definition', 'calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

1416242,Probability of an Indisputable winner at Texas Holdem,"What are the fraction of hands that can be classified as ""indisputable winners"" (aka ""the nuts"") after the river is revealed in Texas Holdem? By ""hand"" I mean the 2 hole cards you have that no one else can see plus the 5 cards on the table. An indisputable winner is a hand that cannot lose.  A clear example would be: you are holding the A,K of spades, and the Q,J,10 of spades are on the table.  No one can beat you, no matter what they are holding.  For clarity, there are ${47 \choose 2}$ hands that meet this exact criteria in each suit. A hand that could be tied would be: you are holding A,K, the table has Q,J,10,7,2, with all four suits represented.  No one can get better than a straight, and you have the best possible straight.  Others could tie you, but you cannot lose.  These are also considered ""indisputable winners"" as there is no risk to betting. Bonus Question: Of the hands that qualify as indisputable, what are the distributions of types of winners?  Straight-flush vs. 4-of-a-kind vs. full-house vs. flush vs. straight vs. 3-of-a-kind. I'll take estimates if the exact calculations are too complex.","['probability', 'poker']"
1416253,Fubini theorem counter example,"While reading Kallenberg's proof of Fubini theorem in Foundations of modern probability , I realized that he first proved Tonelli's theorem, then apply Tonelli to $f_+$ and $f_-$, the positive and negative part of a product absolute integrable function $f(x,y)$. Since both integrals are finite, they can be subtracted to obtain Fubini theorem for $f$. I was wondering, however, if $f_-$ is product integrable with finite  integral, then even $f_+$ integrates to $\infty$, can we still subtract a finite number from $\infty$ and still obtain the Fubini theorem. If not, is there a counter example where $f_-$ has finite integral but integral of its positive part is infinite, and iterated integrals of $f$ yields different values?","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"
1416255,Discrete time equivalent to ODE,"I'm reading a paper in which it is noted that
$$\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = f(t) - \varepsilon v(t)$$

$$v(t+1) = v(t)\exp(-\varepsilon) + \frac{f(t)}{\varepsilon}[1 - \exp(-\varepsilon)].$$ How is this derived? Update: In case I have misunderstood, my question is a simplified version of the text appearing at the top of Page 2 in this supplementary material from this paper .  Namely
$$\frac{dv_i}{dt}=\frac{I_i}{N_i} - \varepsilon v_i$$
$$v_i(t+1)=v_i(t)\exp(-\varepsilon)+\frac{I_i}{\varepsilon N_i}[1-\exp(-\varepsilon)]$$

1416275,Trouble with understanding dual space $V^{*}$.,"I've just began the study of linear functionals and the dual base. And this book I'm reading says the dual space $V^{*}$ may be identified with the space of row vectors. This notion seems very important, but I'm having trouble understanding it. Here is the text: Let $\sigma$ be an element of the dual space $V^{*}$, i.e. a linear
  map $\sigma: V \rightarrow K$. Choose a basis for $V$, say the usual
  the basis, then $\sigma$ is represented by a matrix $[\sigma]$.
  However, such a matrix $[\sigma]$ is a row vector. Also, the map
  $\sigma \rightarrow [\sigma]$ is a vector space isomorphism. On the other hand, any row vector $\phi = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ defines
  a linear functional $\phi: V \rightarrow K$ by \begin{align*}
\phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = (a_1, \ldots, a_n) \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\
\vdots \\ x_n \end{pmatrix} \end{align*} or simply $\phi(x_1, \ldots,
 x_n) = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n$. The author speaks of the matrixrepresentation $[\sigma]$, but he doesn't really explain it. Why is this matrix a row vector? Also, the second part of the text: is this merely a definition? Why does he claim $\phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = a_1 x_1 + \ldots + a_n x_n$? The output of a linear functional is suppose to be a scalar, and not a vector? And this is clearly a linear combination of vectors... Maybe some of the advanced mathematicians here could give me some examples, because I can't get my head around this at the moment.",['linear-algebra']

1416296,Sequence of topological spaces,"A friend of mine did an exercise where a part of the text was: In $\mathbb{R}^3$, with euclidian topology, we consider $X=\mathbb{S}^2 \setminus \{ N \}$, where $N= (0,0,1)$ and $E=\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{S}^2 \mid z=0 \}$. Let be $Y= X/E$ the quotient space obtained from the contraction of $E$ to one point and let $\pi\colon X \rightarrow Y$ be the canonical projection Now a game started in my mind. I know that $Y$ is homeomorphic to two spheres, one of which has a point removed. Now let $X=X_0$ and $Y=X_1$. For each sphere of $X_1$, I'll do the same thing that i did to $Y$ so I'll have $X_2$ that is homeomorphic to $4$ spheres where one of these is without a point. I know that $\mathbb{S}_2 \setminus \{ N \}$ is homeomorphic to a close disk $D^2$. So I create a sequence $\{X_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}} $ of topological spaces where each $X_i$ is homeomorphic to $2^i-1$ spheres tangent where the last one is tangent to a disk. 
The question is: Is it possible to determinate the space $$\lim_{i \to \infty}X_i$$ Is it a topological space? Does this sequence converges? Are we in the space of the topological space? Which kind of space is this? Sorry for my bad english, i hope someone will fix my errors. Thank you","['general-topology', 'topological-vector-spaces']"
1416324,Applying the definition of Lebesgue Integral to specific functions,"I am fairly sure this question will sound rather naive, but I do have a problem with applying the Lebesgue Integral. Actually this question can be divide in two sub-question, related to two examples I have in mind. I know that the integral of $f(x) = x^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ over $[0,1]$ cannot be obtained through Riemann Integration. Fair enough, but how do we actually compute it through Lebesgue Integration? [Here I mean, from the very basics of the theory, without using calculus shortcuts, with the addition that we are allowed to do this from some theorem] I (sort of know) that we cannot compute the integral of a gaussian function $e^{-x^{2}}$ by using standard Riemann techniques. Can the Lebesgue integral accomplish it? If so, how? PS: I do hope what I wrote make sense. If it is not the case, please feel free to point me out any conceptual mistake.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'integration', 'self-learning', 'lebesgue-integral']"
1416357,Understanding first part of dual basis proof,"The textbook I'm reading attempts to proof the following: given $\left\{v_1, \ldots, v_n \right\}$ a basis for a vectorspace $V$ over $K$, there exists a basis $\left\{ \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n \right\}$ for $V^{*}$ defined by \begin{align*} \phi_i (v_j) = \delta_{ij}. \end{align*} Here, each $\phi_i$ is a linear functional, i.e. an element of $V^{*}$. I understand the part of the proof where he shows linear independence, but I'm not sure if I can follow him where he proves these linear functionals span $V^{*}$. Here is what the author claims: We first show that $\left\{ \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n \right\}$ spans
  $V^{*}$. Let $\phi$ be an arbitrary element of $V^{*}$, and suppose
  $\phi(v_1) = k_1, \phi(v_2) = k_2, \ldots, \phi(v_n) = k_n$. Set
  $\sigma = k_1 \phi_1 + \ldots + k_n \phi_n$. Then \begin{align*}
\sigma(v_1) &= (k_1 \phi_1 + \ldots + k_n \phi_n) (v_1) \\ &= k_1
\phi_1 (v_1) + k_2 \phi_2 (v_1) + \ldots + k_n \phi_n (v_1) \\ &= k_1
\cdot 1 + k_2 \cdot 0 + \ldots + k_n \cdot 0 = k_1. \end{align*}
  Similarly for $i= 2, \ldots, n$. Since $\phi$ and $\sigma$ agree on
  the basisvectors, $\phi = \sigma = k_1 \phi_1 + \ldots k_n \phi_n$.
  Accordingly, $\left\{ \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n \right\}$ spans $V^{*}$. I got two questions/complaints. 1) Why does he set $\sigma = k_1 \phi_1 + \ldots + k_n \phi_n$ right away at the beginning? Is he allowed to do that? To me, this seems like circular reasoning. 2) What does he mean with the assertion that $\phi$ and $\sigma$ agree on the basisvectors? Does he mean they determine the same action on the basis? I don't realy understand how he concludes from this that $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n$ span $V^{*}$. Some help/clarifications would be appreciated.",['linear-algebra']
