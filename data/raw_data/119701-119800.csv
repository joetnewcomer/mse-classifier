1786876,Why is this set not a manifold?,"Set $M = \{ \, (x, y) : x^2 = y^2 \, \}$.  If for every point $(a, c)$ in $M$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ containing $(a, c)$ and function $\phi(x, y)$ such that: $\phi(x, y) = 0$ on $M \cap U$; The Jacobian matrix associated with $\phi$ has rank $1$ on $U$.  (In general, it does not have to be rank $1$.  But here the only choice is $1$.) Then, $M$ is a manifold.  If the Jacobian matrix has ranks greater than $0$, then we have use $\phi$ to carry out the implicit function theorem, and construct a function such that $(x, y) = (x, f(x))$ on $M \cap U$.  But I don't know how to go in reverse; what is the contradiction if $M$ is a manifold? An educated guess says that $(0, 0)$ is our trouble spot.  The function $\varphi(x, y) = x^2 - y^2$ equals $0$ on $M$.  But the Jacobian matrix has zero rank at $(0, 0)$.  So, we cannot use $\varphi$ to carry out the implicit function theorem...",['multivariable-calculus']
1786896,Rounding error of trapezoidal method,"I'm working with the Modified Euler method sometimes called Heun's method or explicit trapezoidal method. I have a book on ordinary differential equations numerical analysis that claims: The effect of rounding error on the accuracy of the numerical solution
   is very similar to the error of the numerical differentiation
   formulas: the truncation error decreases with h but the rounding error
   increases and there exist an optimal value for which the sum of both
   errors is minimum. This optimal value for $h$ is very little (for example for Euler's
   method is $\sqrt\mu$ where $\mu$ is the accuracy of the machine) and so
   it's computationally expensive. I have an example of what he is talking about with numerical differentiation formulas so for example take the differentiation formula: $$f'(x_0) \simeq \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}~\text{  with error }~-h \frac{f''(\theta)}{2}$$ then I write $e(x)$ the rounding error on point $x$ and so the total error made while aproximating $f'(x_0)$ is $$
\frac{e(x_0+h)-e(x_0)}{h} - h \frac{f''(\theta)}{2}.
$$ Assuming that rounding errors are bounded by $\epsilon$ and that $f''$ is bounded by M in $[x_0,x_0+h]$ then the total error verifies: $$
\left|f'(x_0)-\frac{f_1(x_0+h)-f_1(x_0)}{h}\right| \leq 2 \frac{\epsilon}{h} + \frac{h}{2}M
$$ where $f_1$ is the approximation of $f$ with rounding error. So, when $h$ decreases the error of the formula (truncation error) decreases but rounding error increases. My question is very simple, how can I get a similar situation for the trapezoidal method?","['numerical-methods', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'rounding-error', 'error-propagation']"

Conversely, by Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{\phi(25)} = x^{20} \equiv 1 \pmod{25}$ if $\gcd(x,25) = 1$ and thus $x^4 = x \cdot x^3 \equiv x^{21} \cdot x^3 \equiv x^{24} \equiv (x^3)^8 \pmod{25}$. $\square$ I am not sure if the above proves the result, but it does show that if we have an $8$th power of an integer modulo $25$ and it is relatively prime to $25$, then it is equal to a fourth power of an integer modulo $25$ and vice-versa.

1786971,Inverting an $n \times n$ matrix using determinant,"We're asked to invert the following matrix with the help of guided questions.
$$\begin{pmatrix} 1 + a_1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\ 1 & 1+a_2 & \ddots & \vdots \\ \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 1 \\ 1 & \cdots & 1 & 1 + a_n \end{pmatrix}$$ To do that, the problem considered the following determinant : Let $(r_1,r_2,\cdots,r_n)$ be distinct real numbers and
$(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^2$
$$\Delta(x) = \begin{vmatrix} r_1 + x & a+x & \cdots & a+x \\ b+x & r_2+x & \ddots & \vdots \\ \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & a+x \\ b+x & \cdots & b+x & r_n + x \end{vmatrix}$$ Then we are asked to prove there exists two real numbers A and B such that for all real numbers $x$ $$\Delta(x) = Ax + B$$ I have done a row reduction on the matrix to simplify it. For $i$ going from $n-1$ to $1$ $L_{i+1} \leftarrow L_{i+1} - L_i$ $$\Delta(x) = \begin{vmatrix} r_1 + x & a+x & \cdots & a+x \\ b-r_1 & r_2-a & 0  & 0 \\ 0 & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & b- r_n & r_n-a\end{vmatrix}$$ Then I developped with respect to the first row. Let $\Delta_{i,j}$ be the minor of $\Delta$ then $$\Delta(x) = (r_1 + x)\Delta_{1,1} + (a+x)\sum\limits_{j=2}^n (-1)^{1+j}\Delta_{1,j} $$ Rearranging the forula gives A and B independent of $x$ which proves their existence : $$\Delta(x) = x[\Delta_{1,1} + \sum\limits_{j=2}^n (-1)^{1+j}\Delta_{1,j}] + r_1\Delta_{1,1} + a\sum\limits_{j=2}^n (-1)^{1+j}\Delta_{1,j} $$ The real problem i'm facing is the next question: 
Given the polynome $P(X) = \prod\limits_{k=1}^n(r_k-X)$ and supposing $a \neq b$ we need to prove that  $$\Delta(0) = \frac{aP(b)-bP(a)}{a-b}$$
To use the first question I noticed $\Delta(0) = B$ and simplified it
$$
   B = r_1\Delta_{1,1} + a\sum\limits_{j=2}^n (-1)^{1+j}\Delta_{1,j} 
\\ \Delta_{1,1} = \prod\limits_{i=2}^n (r_k-a) 
$$ Since $\Delta_{1,1}$ is an inferiour triangular matrix, then similarly :
$$\Delta_{1,n} = \prod\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} (b-r_k) $$
For other minors I noticed that we can split them into diagonal inferiour and superior triangular blocks $$
\Delta_{i,j}=
\left|
\begin{array}{c|c}
B' & O \\
\hline
O & A'
\end{array}
\right|
$$
and thus $\forall j\in \{2,\cdots,n-1\} $
$$\Delta_{1,j} = \prod\limits_{i=2}^{j-1} (b-r_k)\prod\limits_{i=j+1}^{n} (r_k-a)$$
So i ended up with this 
$$\Delta(0) = B = r_1\prod\limits_{i=2}^n (r_k-a) + a\left(\sum\limits_{j=2}^{n-1} (-1)^{1+j}\prod\limits_{i=2}^{j-1} (b-r_k)\prod\limits_{i=j+1}^{n} (r_k-a)\right) + \\ a\times(-1)^{1+n}\times\prod\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} (b-r_k) $$ I feel like i am close to getting $P(b)$ and $P(a)$ from the first and last terms but i can't seem to see how?

1787001,Conditional Distributions vs. Stochastic Processes,"Is the concept of a version of a stochastic process related to the concept of a version of a conditional distribution? And is a regular version of a stochastic process somehow the same thing as the regular version of a conditional distribution? I find this confusing because both concepts seem like they are supposed to resolve ambiguities arising when going from the countable to the uncountable case, but I rarely see authors use or explain the terminology rigorously, seemingly because they already understand it. Note: regular version of a stochastic process refers to a version which is regular in the sense that it has regular paths (right-continuous, cadlag, continuous). I saw a more precise definition in a textbook once, but now I can't remember which textbook it was. It was in any case definitely along the lines of the implicit definition used in other texts, namely a version of the stochastic process with regular paths. UPDATE: I found the following definition of regular function on Wikipedia in the context of integration by parts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue%E2%80%93Stieltjes_integration#Integration_by_parts It is very similar to the notions I mentioned earlier for functions with countably many jump discontinuities (since one can modify the value of the function at those points, with no change to its integrals, to make it regular vis-a-vis cadlag). A function $f$ is regular at a point $a$ if and only if the left and right hand limits $f(a-)$ and $f(a+)$ both exist and the function takes the average value at $a$, i.e. $$f(a)= \frac{f(a-)+f(a+)}{2}$$","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'terminology', 'measure-theory', 'conditional-expectation']"

This seems obvious to me from the definition of intersection. That is: $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_{i}= \{x \in S: \forall i \in I, x \in A_i\}$. Since every element in the set is, by definition, in $A_i$ for all $i \in I$, it is, of course, also in $A_k, k \in I$. Therefore, the set is a subset of $A_k$. Is this all I need to show?

Because from my understanding, in order for it to be a tangent line, it intersects the curve at one point only, however $\Delta x$ approaches zero, it never reaches it, so $\Delta x$ must be greater than zero, however infinitesimally small, correct?

1787096,Solving the roots of Redlich Kwong Equation,"Good evening everyone. After studying some equations of state, I've read about the mathematical steps formulated to model some. In the particular case of Van der Waals, where
$$P=\frac{RT}{v-b}-\frac{a}{v^2}$$ For those not familiar with this expression, this equation describes general characteristics of a real gas, P standing for pressure, R for the universal gas constant, T for temperature, v for molar volume (Yep, I know the little line is missing, sorry!), and a and b are characteristic constants for the gas . There are some special values for Temperature, Pressure and Molar volume. Finding them, apparently, helps me in my quest for a and b. I am told the following steps to do so in VdW equation: 1) Derive the function twice. 2) Solve RT for each derivative and make them equal to zero.Make an equation of of the derivative and the second derivative, then solve for v 3) Plug the value of V in the first derivative, and solve for T, now called critical temperature. 3 4) Plug the values of V and T in the original function, thus obtaining the critical pressure. 4 5) Solve ""a"" for critical T and critical P, then making the equation and obtaining ""b""[5] 6) Plug ""b"" in critical T, now obtaining ""a""[6] Now, back to my problem, I'm looking for ""a"" and ""b"" again, but now in the Redlich Kwong equation:
$$P=\frac{RT}{v-b}-\frac{a}{\sqrt(T)*(v^2+vb)}$$
I've already derived the function twice and solved for RT:
$$P'=\frac{-RT}{(v-b)^2}+\frac{a(2v+b)}{\sqrt(T)*((v^2+vb)^-2)}=0$$
$$RT=\frac{a(2v+b)*((v-b)^2}{\sqrt(T)*((v^2+vb)^-2)}$$ $$P''=\frac{2RT}{(v-b)^-3}+\frac{2a}{\sqrt(T)*((v^2+vb)^-2)}-\frac{2a*(2v+b)^2}{\sqrt(T)*((v^2+vb)^-3)}=0$$
$$RT=\frac{a}{\sqrt(T)}*((v-b)^3)*(\frac{(2v+b)^2}{((v^2)+vb)^3}-\frac{1}{(v^2)+vb)^2})$$ After putting the two =0, I've obtained this far:
$$3v+2b=(v-b)*((2v+b)^2)((v^2)+vb)$$ As it isn't as simple as in the VdW case, I certainly don't know where to go now in order to obtain a value of v based on b. I would be so grateful if someone checked this, thank you!","['algebra-precalculus', 'calculus']"

1787415,Probability of having at least $j$ collisions when tossing $m$ balls into $n$ bins,"Suppose that we throw $m$ balls into $n$ bins uniformly and independantly at random. We consider collisions as distinct unordered pairs, e.g., if 3 balls are tossed in one bin, we count 3 collisions. What is the probability of having at least $j$ collisions when we throw $m$ balls into $n$ bins, such that at least $j$ bins are empty at the end of the process? ##Case $m \leq n$ :
As we suppose $m < n$ , this question is in fact equivalent to computing the probability that we toss $m$ balls in $m-j$ bins. Indeed, we throw our $m-j$ first balls in distinct bins, and the $j$ remaining balls in these $m-j$ bins.
We can view tossing $m$ balls in $m-j$ as the following equation: $$x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_{m-j} = m$$ where $x_i$ is the number of balls in bin $i$ . The number of solutions in $\mathbb{N}$ of this equation is a $m$ -combination on a set of size $m-j$ , i.e., $\binom{m+m-j-1}{m} = \binom{2m - j - 1}{m}$ . The number of ways to choose $m-j$ bins out of $n$ is $\binom{n}{m-j}$ . The number of possibilities to throw $m$ balls in $n$ bins is $n^m$ , thus $$\mathbb{P}[\text{at least } j \text{ collisions}] = \frac{\binom{2m - j - 1}{m} \cdot \binom{n}{m-j}}{n^m}.$$ What do you think of this approach? Am I overcounting/undercounting something? ##Case $m > n$ :
In my opinion, this case is much harder to solve. As I count collisions as distinct unordered pairs, the total number of collisions is $$\sum_{i = 1}^n \binom{x_i}{2}$$ where $x_i$ is the number of balls in bin $i$ . Hence, to have exactly $j$ collisions, a necessary condition is to have $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \binom{x_i}{2} = j$ . Let's tweak this equation a bit. $$ \begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \binom{x_i}{2} = j & \iff \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i!}{2 \cdot (x_i-2)!} = j\\
& \iff \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_i!}{(x_i-2)!} = 2j\\
& \iff \sum_{i=1}^n x_i(x_i-1) = 2j\\
& \iff \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = 2j + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\
& \iff \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = 2j + m
\end{align*}
$$ where the last equality follows from the fact the sum of the balls in each bins is the number of balls tossed. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to solving the following problem: how many representations as a sum of $n$ squares does a number have? This problem seems far from trivial to me, as I did not find easy explicit formulas to work with. However this approach was for finding exactly $j$ collisions, and I am interested in finding at least $j$ collisions. As $m > n$ , we will have some collisions. We can express $m = qn + r$ for some $q, r \in \mathbb{N}$ . The least collisions we will have is when the balls are uniformly distributed amongst the bins, thus we will have at least $$C_{min} = \sum_{i=1}^r \binom{q+1}{2} + \sum_{i=1}^{n-r} \binom{q}{2}$$ collisions, which forces $j > C_{min}$ . The problem thus becomes, in how many ways can we distribute $m$ balls into $n$ bins such that $\sum_{i=1}^n \binom{x_i}{2} \geq j$ . Here I am stuck, I can't find an easy way with combinatorics to solve this. I am fine with this problem being solved asymptotically, so if you have any ideas and/or references on the subject... :). Thanks for reading and helping #Edit
I think both cases above are wrong, because I was undercounting some things. $m \leq n$ "" /> This image shows that the probability of having $j$ collisions do not increase nor decrease. I was expecting something like a gaussian, or at least something with a low probabiliy of having a few collisions, a high probability of having an average number of collisions, and a low probability of having a lot of collisions. I thought about another way of counting, and I think the results I obtain are better. For that, I need the following Lemma, taken from this paper, page 16 . Lemma 1: The probability that exactly $k$ bins are not empty after throwing $m$ balls is $\frac{\binom{n}{k}k!S(m,k)}{n^m}$ , where $S(m,k)$ is a Stirling number of the second kind. With this Lemma, I obtain the following result. Lemma 2: Let $m$ be the number of balls thrown uniformly and independently ar random into $n$ bins. The probability of having at least $j>1$ collisions and at least $j$ empty bins is $$ \mathbb{P}[\text{at least } j \text{ collisions}] = \frac{1}{n^{m}} \sum_{i=1}^{n-j} \binom{n}{i} i! S(m,i). $$ Proof: As explained previously, the probability of having at least $j$ collisions and at least $j$ empty bins (or at most $n-j$ non-empty bins) is equal to the probability of tossing $m$ balls in at most $n-j$ bins. Let $A$ be the event ""at most $n-j$ bins are not empty"" and let $A_i$ be the event ""exactly $i$ bins are not empty"". Then $A = \cup_{i=1}^{n-j} A_j$ and $A_i \cap A_k = \emptyset$ if $i \neq k$ , hence $\mathbb{P}[A] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-j}\mathbb{P}[A_j]$ and Lemma 1 concludes the proof. $\square$ We can see on the next plot that this results already seems closer to reality (this was plotted for $n = 500$ , $m = 200$ and $j$ from $1$ to $1000$ ). Moreover, with this approach, we don't need to separate the cases $m \leq n$ and $m > n$ (at least I think, you might need to correct me on this). The downside is that now we have to work with a sum... and Stirling numbers of the second kind... Do you guys have any idea to remove the sum and obtain an upper bound of this?","['balls-in-bins', 'sums-of-squares', 'probability', 'combinatorics', 'solution-verification']"

I am saying this because images can create confusion. Anyways I will change them as soon as possible. I could consider $r=f(\alpha)$ and $t=g(\alpha)$ but for this question I am going to take $r$ and $t$ as constants. If they were functions of $\alpha$ there would appear some interesting shapes. I experimented for different functions however the areas are more difficult to calculate, that's why I am not going to share. Maybe in the future. We rotate the hall for $r=t$ in the example above: In this case: point A moves on a semicircle The envelope of lines between A' and C' is a circular arc. One has to prove this but I assume that it is true for $r=t$. If my second assumption is correct the area of sofa is $A= 2r-\frac { \pi r^{ 2 } }{ 2 } +\frac { \pi  }{ 2 } $. The maximum area is reached when $r = 2/\pi$ and it's value is:
$$A = 2/\pi+\pi/2 = 2,207416099$$ which matches with Hammersley's sofa. The shape is also similar or same: Now I am going to increase $t$ with respect to $r$. For $r=2/\pi$ and $t=0.77$: Well, this looks like Gerver's sofa . I believe thearea can be maximized by finding the equations of envelopes above and below the sofa. Look at this question where @Aretino has computed the area below $ABC$. I don't know enough to find equations for envelopes. I am afraid that I will make mistakes. I considered to calculate area by counting number of pixels in it, but this is not a good idea because for optimizing the area I have to create many images. I will give a bounty of 200 for whom calculates the maximum area. As I said the most difficult part of the problem is to find equations of envelopes. @Aretino did it. PLUS: Could following be the longest sofa where $(r,t)=((\sqrt 5+1)/2,1)$ ? If you want to investigate further or use animation for educational purposes here is the Geogebra file: http://ggbm.at/vemEtGyj Ok, I had some free time and I count number of pixels in the sofa and I am sure that I have something bigger than Hammersley's constant. First, I made a simulation for Hammersley's sofa where $r=t=2/\pi$ and exported the image to png in 300 dpi (6484x3342 pixels) and using Gimp counted number of pixels which have exactly same value. For Hammersley I got $3039086$ pixels. For the second case $r=0.59$ and $t=0.66$ and I got $3052780$ pixels. To calculate area for this case: $$\frac{3052780}{3039086}(2/\pi + \pi/2)=2.217362628$$ which is slightly less than Gerver's constant which is $2.2195$.

1787679,"Explicit computation of $H^2(\mathbb{F}_p^n, \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$.","I'm interested in the computation of the second cohomology group of the elementary abelian group $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$: $$H^2(\mathbb{F}_p^n, \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{F}_p^{n(n-1)/2}$$ where for simplicity let's suppose $p$ is odd.  I'm pretty sure this is right. The following discussion of how the right hand side arises is cribbed from [ Tata Lectures on Theta III , Mumford, Nori and Norman]; any mistakes my own. The space $\mathbb{F}_p^{n(n-1)/2}$ on the right corresponds naturally to the space of alternating bilinear maps $\mathbb{F}_p^n \times \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$.  The link to $H^2$ comes from looking at the commutator map $G \times G \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ in the corresponding central extension $$0 \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \to G \to \mathbb{F}_p^n \to 0$$ and noting it descends to an alternating bilinear map  $\mathbb{F}_p^n \times \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ on the quotient.
If $\rho \colon \mathbb{F}_p^n \times \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ is an explicit 2-cocycle, then this alternating form is just
$$\sigma(a,b) = \rho(a,b) - \rho(b,a) $$
and is readily seen to be invariant under adding coboundaries to $\rho$. So, this defines a homomorphism
$$H^2(\mathbb{F}_p^n, \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}) \to \mathbb{F}_p^{n(n-1)/2}$$
and it's not hard to show it's surjective, i.e., to construct very explicit Heisenberg-group-type examples of group extensions or cocycles showing that every $\sigma$ arises in this way.  It is also clear that the kernel consists precisely of even cocycles (i.e., $\rho(a,b) = \rho(b,a)$) modulo coboundaries. My question is: Question: can someone give me an fairly explicit proof that this map is injective , and therefore that $H^2(\mathbb{F}_p^n, \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$ is what we think it is? At some point a proof must use the fact that $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ hasn't been replaced by, say, $\mathbb{F}_p$, as then cocycles corresponding to $\mathbb{Z}/p^2 \mathbb{Z}$ will be in the kernel. What I would love to have, in order of preference, is: an algorithm that takes any even cocycle on $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and spits out an explicit function whose coboundary is $\rho$; any proof from which such an algorithm could in principle be recovered, even if doing so involves a lot of work diving into proofs of standard results; or any proof at all. As ever, any pointers or references greatly appreciated.","['finite-groups', 'group-cohomology', 'group-extensions', 'group-theory']"
1787683,"The relationship between random variables, distribution functions and probability measures","Given a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$, and a random variable $X\colon\Omega\to\Bbb{R}$, we can associate with it its distribution function $F\colon \Bbb{R}\to[0,1]$ defined as

F(x)&=P(X\le x)=P(\{\omega\in\Omega:X(\omega)\le x \}).

Further, we can define an induced probability measure $\mu\colon \mathcal{B}\to[0,1]$ by
\begin{align*}
\mu(A) &= P(X\in A)=P(\{\omega\in\Omega:X(\omega)\in A \}).
\end{align*} I read in this answer that $\mu$ and $F$ uniquely determine eachother. My question is: can we do this ""in reverse"", i.e. starting with a probability measure $\mu\colon \mathcal{B}\to[0,1]$, can we then get a unique random variable? On $(\Bbb{R},\mathcal{B},P)$, I tried to do this starting with $\mu(A)=P(A)$ for all $A\in\mathcal{B}$, where $P(A)=\mathrm{Leb}(A\cap[0,1])$.

Furthermore, how can I study the stability for the iterative method? Which stability definition is the better one and why?. I explain both methods below. Consider an initial value problem given by $y' = f(t, y)$ and $y(a) = t_0$, where $f$ is defined in $[a, b]\times[\alpha, \beta]$ and satisfies the Lipschitz property with Lipschitz's constant $L$. Given a natural number $n$ and $h = \frac{b-a}{n}$, we are trying to approximate the unique solution of the problem at $t_i = a + ih \ \forall i = 0, 1 \ldots n$. If $y$ is the solution, we call $y_i = y(t_i)$ and we denote $w_i$ to the approximations obtained by the applied method. One of the methods studied is the explicit trapezoidal method. It follows the following rule: $w_{i+1} = w_i + \frac{h}{2} \left[f(t_i,w_i) + f(t_{i}+h, w_i + h f(t_i,w_i))\right]$ We have proved that it has a local error of order 3 and, hence, a global error of order 2. Then, reading some books I came accros the iterative trapezoidal method, which solves the following implicit equation: $ w_{i}= w_{i-1} + \frac{h}{2} \left[f(t_{i-1}, w_{i-1}) + f(t_i, w_{i})\right] $ The idea is taking an initial approximation $w_i^{(0)}$ and defining the following sequence: $w_{i} ^{(j+1)} = w_{i-1} + \frac{h}{2} \left[f(t_{i-1}, w_{i-1}) + f(t_i, w_{i}^{(j)})\right]$ The limit of that sequence is taken as $w_i$.

What are the best things to do to improve my technique and ability to solve problems? Let me give an example of what I mean. I just asked another question about showing a particular map is a submersion. I have an intuitive understanding of what is going on. In the context of the problem, I can see what is happening in the case $\pi: SO_3 \to S^2$. The idea is that if I look at a point on a sphere, and I look at the directions coming off of that point, there is a rotation of the sphere that moves it in that direction. For instance, if I'm looking at a point on the equator, there is a rotation that moves the point northward, and a rotation that moves it westward, and that's enough to show I can move the point in any direction I like. But, turning that into a proof is a little bit of a daunting task. So daunting, in fact, I was compelled to ask about it. When I asked my professor about this problem, he drew me a picture and explained the intuition. I think intuition is important, but what I'm having trouble with it turning my intuition into a proof.

When I say tools here, I mean something along the lines of ""use Sard's theorem"" or ""partitions of unity."" For example, I would say that using the regular level set theorem, instead of constructing charts, to show that some set is a manifold is a tool.

$$y(x)=2\left(1+2(x-1)+3(x-1)^2+\frac{10}{3}(x-1)^3+\frac{19}{6}(x-1)^4+\frac{26}{10}(x-1)^5+\cdots\right)$$

$$a_{n+1}=\frac{2(a_n+a_{n-1})}{n+1}.$$
Due to the variable coefficient I'm not sure how to determine the radius of convergence from the recurrence.  My naive attempt was to use
$$\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=\frac{2\left(1+\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\right)}{n+1}$$
and assume that
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|=R,\quad 0<R<\infty$$
to obtain a contradiction indicating that the radius is either 0 or infinite, but that is not very helpful.

I know that the solution (valid for all $x$) is $$y(x)=2\mathrm{e}^{x^2-1}.$$ Question: How would one obtain the radius of convergence of this series from the recurrence.

Where the coefficients are the elements of the sequence. The characteristics of $p_n$ are interesting because $p_n(0)=a_n$ and $p_n(1)=\sum_{n}a_n$ For instance, applied to the Möebius function: $p_0 = 1$ $p_1 = x-1$ $p_2 = x^2-x-1$ $p_3 = x^3-x^2-x$ $p_4 = x^4-x^3-x^2-1$ ... $p_n(0)=\mu(n)$ ( $n^{th}$ element of the Möbius sequence) and $p_n(1)=\sum_{n}\mu(n)$ is the partial summation up to $n$ of the Möbius function, in other words, it is the Merten's function . This is the graph of the first $100$ polynomials, $p_0$ to $p_{99}$ And this is a zoom of the segment [0,1] so it is possible to see the ramifications of each polynomial from the position of the last $\mu(n)$ to the position of the last $\sum_n\mu(n)$ .

Let $X$ be a set with an injection $h:X \to X$ and $Y$ a subset such that $h(X) \subset Y \subset X$. The goal is to prove there's a bijection between $Y$ and $X$ following these steps: $(1)$ Prove there exists a minimal subset $Z \subset X$ such that $(X-Y)\subset Z$ and $h(Z)\subset Z$ $(2)$ Prove that $h(Z)=Z\cap Y$ $(3)$ Using the injective function $h$ and the subset $Z\subset X$ defined in $(1)$ construct a bijective function $h':X\to Y$ $(4)$ Prove, using the steps above, that if $A$ and $B$ are sets such that there exist two injections $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to A$, then there is a bijection between those sets. . This is what I've done: $(1)$ Let $I=\lbrace V\subset X | (X-Y) \subset V \land h(V) \subset V \rbrace$ and define  $Z=\bigcap_{V\in I} V$ It can be proven that $Z$ satisfies all the conditions required (I omit the details but if someone asks me to I will write them) and in addition $Z$ is not empty. $(2)$ Here is where I'm stuck. It is clear that $h(Z)\subset Z$ by definition and because of $h(X)\subset Y$ then $h(Z)\subset Y$,so one of the inclusion is obvious but I can't prove the other one. I've tryed assuming there is some $x\in Z\cap Y$ which is not in $h(Z)$ but I didn't find any contradiction under this assumption (which is what I'm needing) Perhaps reductio ad absurdum is not the right way to get it, any advise on this point would be greatly appreciated. $(3)$ Let $h':X\to Y$ be defined as follows: $$h'(x)=h(x) \ \mbox{if $x \in Z$} \\ h'(x)=x \ \mbox{if $x \not\in Z$}$$ Again I omit the details but it can be proven that $h'$ is a bijection. $(4)$ Finally, here i tryed to ""emulate"" what I've done in the steps before.

I tryed defining it this way: $$t(x)=f(x) \ \mbox{if $x \in Z$} \\ t(x)=g^{-1}(x) \ \mbox{if $x \not\in Z$}$$ But I don't feel completly confident with it, I think something is not working with this function I've defined. .

1788468,Homotopy Poincaré conjecture - no map inducing the isomorphism on homology,"$\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}$
In Terence Tao's notes on page 18, concerning the Poincaré conjecture , he gave the following sketchy proof of the homotopy Poincaré conjecture. Given $M^3$ a 3-manifold with $\pi_1(M^3)=0$, then automatically $0=H_1(X,\Z)=H^2(X,\Z)=H_2(X,\Z)$.  Moreover the action of $\pi_1(M_3) \curvearrowright H^{n-1}(S^{n-1},\Z)$ where $S^{n-1} \hookrightarrow Sp(T(M^3)) \to M^3$ is the fiber of the sphere bundle over the basepoint of $M$, is trivial since $\pi_1(M^3)=0$, so that $M^3$ is orientable. Therefore $H^3(M^3,\Z)=\Z$ and $H^i(M^3,\Z)=0$ for $i>3$ because $M^3$ is a 3 dimensional manifold (easy argument from excision). Terence Tao then says that it follows from the Whitehead theorem that $M^3 \to S^3$ is a homotopy equivalence. It does not follow since there is no map inducing the isomorphisms on homology between $S^3$ and $M^3$. Is there a Postnikov decomposition trick to show that we don't need the map to induce the isomorphism or is there an obvious map that I am missing?","['algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'homotopy-theory']"

However we can construct a fractal known as a Gosper island , that has the same area as the hexagon but has the property that when surrounded by 6 identical copies produces a similar shape, but with dimensions scaled by a factor of $\sqrt{7}$. What is the distance between two of the centers? Is it the same as the distance between hexagons of the same area? ie. If I start with a hexagon of area A, then construct a Gosper island and place it next to an identical copy, would the distance still be the same as if they were hexagons? Or does the scaling factor come into play somewhere? Right now I think the answer is $\sqrt{3}/2$, as for the hexagon. The reason I ask is that I'm trying to calculate the Gosper island's moment of inertia through an axis through its centre of mass and perpendicular to the plane of the island. If we assume that the moment of inertia is always proportional to the mass, and proportional to the square of a characteristic length scale, then 
$$
I = \gamma Ml^2,
$$
where $\gamma$ is a constant, $l$ is the 'diameter' of the island, in a hexagon this would be the distance between two opposite vertices. Shrink the Gosper island by the scaling factor and surround it by six others. This self-similarity technique is super cute, and can be used to calculate the moment of inertia of an equilateral triangle, and can be extended to a square/rectangle quite easily. Fractals, having a high degree of self-similarity, seem amenable to this technique - here I calculate the moment of inertia for a Koch snowflake. $\hspace{1.3cm}$ Using the principle of superposition,
$$
I = I_{\text{centre}} + 6I_{\text{edge}},
$$
where
$$
I_{\text{centre}} =\gamma \frac{M}{7}\left(\frac{l}{\sqrt{7}}\right)^2 = \gamma \frac{Ml^2}{49} = \frac{I}{49}.
$$ Now, by the parallel axis theorem $\displaystyle I_{\text{edge}} = I_{\text{COM}} + Md^2$ where 
$$
\displaystyle I_{\text{COM}} = \frac{I}{49}
$$
and $\displaystyle d= \frac{\sqrt{3} l}{2}  $ (this was one source of error), so
$\displaystyle I_{\text{edge}} = \frac{I}{49} + \frac{3Ml^2}{4},$ and

\frac{6I}{7} & = \frac{9Ml^2}{2}, \\
I & = \frac{21Ml^2}{4}.

I am not sure how we can show $\mu = \mu_0$ I think maybe we have to show by construction that $\mu \leq \mu_0$ and $\mu \geq \mu_0$ For c.) I haven't any idea for. Any suggestions is greatly appreciated.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"
1788853,Solution to General Linear SDE,"In order to find a solution for the general linear SDE
\begin{align}
dX_t = \big( a(t) X_t + b(t) \big) dt + \big( g(t) X_t + h(t) \big) dB_t,
\end{align}
I assume that $a(t), b(t), g(t)$ and  $h(t)$ are given deterministic Borel functions on $\mathbb{R}_+$ that are bounded on each compact time interval. To find a suitable integrating factor $Z_t$,
\begin{align}
dX_t - \big( a(t) dt - g(t) dB_t \big) X_t =  b(t) dt + h(t)  dB_t
\end{align}
brings me to
\begin{align}
Z_t = e^{-\int_0^t ( a(s) - \frac{1}{2}g^2(s) )ds - \int_0^t g(s) dB_s}.
\end{align}
So,
\begin{align}
d(Z_tX_t) &=  Z_t \big( b(t) dt + h(t)  dB_t \big) \\
X_t &= Z_t^{-1} \big(X_0 + \int_0^t  Z_s b(s) ds + \int_0^t Z_s h(s)  dB_s \big).
\end{align}
To find an explicit solution for the SDE, I am considering
\begin{align}
X_t &= Z_t^{-1} Y_t \\
dX_t &= d(Z_t^{-1} Y_t) \\
&= Z_t^{-1} dY_t + Y_t dZ_t^{-1} + d[Z_t^{-1}, Y_t].
\end{align}
Where $dZ_t^{-1} = Z_t^{-1} \big( a(t) dt + g(t) dB_t \big)$ and $dY_t = Z_t \big( b(t) dt + h(t) dB_t \big)$. My question is, how to find $d[Z_t^{-1}, Y_t]$ and how to work towards the explicit solution for the SDE?","['stochastic-analysis', 'probability-theory', 'stochastic-calculus', 'stochastic-differential-equations']"

It's clear that any $u\in X'\otimes Y$ with $$u=\sum_{i=1}^n\varphi_i\otimes y_i$$ for some $n\in\mathbb N$ and $(\varphi_i,y_i)\in X'\times Y$ yields some $L\in\mathfrak L(X,Y)$ via $$L:=\varphi_iy_i\;.$$ However, is the mapping $X'\otimes Y\to\mathfrak L(X,Y)$ which maps $u$ to $L$ injective? The other inclusion is not clear to me at all. However, the question arose as I saw people identifying $X'\otimes Y$ with $\mathfrak L(X,Y)$.","['functional-analysis', 'tensor-products', 'operator-theory']"
