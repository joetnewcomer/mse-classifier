395100,What will be the support of the convolution of two test functions.,"If $g\in C^{\infty}_c$ defined on $\Bbb R^n$ and K is the support of function $g$. I want to find the support of $g_\epsilon$. Where $g_\epsilon$ is regularization of $g$. Regularization of $g$ is defined as: $g_\epsilon$:=  $g*\omega_\epsilon$ (convolution of g and a test function) i.e. $g_\epsilon(x
)$=$\int_{\Bbb R^n}g(x-y).\omega_\epsilon(y)dy $ I think, this process is also known as mollification. Here 
$ \omega_\epsilon (x)= 
\begin{cases}
\frac{C^{-1}}{\epsilon^n} e^{{\frac{-\epsilon^2}{{\epsilon^2}-|x|^2}}},  &\text{for |x|< $\epsilon$ } \\
0, & \text{otherwise}  \\
\end{cases} $ I only know that support of convolution of two compactly supported functions is again a compact set. And, as support of $\omega_\epsilon $ is a ball $B(0,\epsilon)$ and support of g is a compact set K(given) then support of their convolution should be the intersection of the support of $g(x-y)$ and $\omega_\epsilon(y)$.

395110,Set Notation (Axiom of Replacement),"This question is related to the one I asked yesterday here in that it's related to another one of the Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms .

Current Interpretation: For all the elements of the three sets $X, Y, Z,$ if the property $\varphi$ holds under some parameter $p$ for $x, y $ and $x, z$ conjointly implies that $y$ equals $z$ then for any set X there exists a set Y such that for any element of $Y$ there exists an element of X such that property $\varphi$ holds under both the element of $Y$ and the chosen element of $X$ for that property $p$. What I'm confused about is the purpose of the extra parameter $p$ and the set $Z$ why couldn't you just say something like this: $$ \forall \space x \space \forall \space y \space \varphi (x,y) \Rightarrow \forall \space X \space \exists \space Y \space \forall \space y \space [y \in Y \equiv (\exists \space x \in X) \varphi(x, y, p) ]  $$ What am I missing here?

395121,How Entropy scales with sample size,"For a discrete probability distribution, the entropy is defined as:
$$H(p) = \sum_i p(x_i) \log(p(x_i))$$
I'm trying to use the entropy as a measure of how ""flat / noisy"" vs. ""peaked"" a distribution is, where smaller entropy corresponds to more ""peakedness"". I want to use a cutoff threshold to decide which distributions are ""peaked"" and which are ""flat"". The problem with this approach is that for ""same shaped"" distributions, the entropy is different for different sample sizes! as a simple example take the uniform distribution - it's entropy is:
$$p_i = \frac{1}{n}\ \ \to \ \ H = \log n$$
To make things worse, there doesn't seem to be a general rule for more complex distributions. So, the question is: How should I normalize the entropy so that I get the same ""scaled entropy"" for ""same"" distributions irrespective of the sample size?","['probability-distributions', 'entropy', 'discrete-mathematics']"

395139,Combinatorial proof of a Stirling number identity.,"Consider the identity $$\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^kk!{n \brace k} = (-1)^n$$ where ${n\brace k}$ is a Stirling number of the second kind. This is slightly reminiscent of the binomial identity $$\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^k\binom{n}{k} = 0$$ which essentially states that the number of even subsets of a set is equal to the number of odd subsets. Now there is an easy proof of the binomial identity using symmetric differences to biject between even and odd subsets. I am wondering if there is an analogous combinatorial interpretation for the Stirling numbers. The term $k!{n\brace k}$ counts the number of set partitions of an $n$ element set into $k$ ordered parts. Perhaps there is something relating odd ordered partitions with even ordered partitions? As an added note, there is a similar identity $$\sum_{k=1}^n(-1)^k(k-1)!{n\brace k}=0$$ for $n \geq 2$ .

395166,"Is the set of submonoids of $(\Bbb N,+)$ countable?","Having the monoid $(\Bbb N,+)$, I wonder if there are countable many submonoids. There are obviously infinitely many since $S_n = \{kn \mid k \in \Bbb N\}$ is a submonoid for any $n \in \Bbb N$. My conjecture is that the set of all submonoids is countable, because I think the following statements (which I failed to prove so far) hold for any submonoid $S$ of $(\Bbb N,+)$: there is an odd element in $S$ $\Rightarrow \exists e \forall f: (f \ge e \rightarrow f \in S)$ $\Rightarrow \Bbb N \setminus S$ is finite all elements of $S$ are even $\Rightarrow \exists e \forall f: (2f \ge e \rightarrow 2f \in S)$ $\Rightarrow \Bbb N \setminus (S \cup \{1,3,5,...\})$ is finite In both cases we can identify the submonoid by a finite set of numbers which are not elements of the submonoid. Therefore we have only countable many possibilities. Can you complete this approach or provide a better one?","['abstract-algebra', 'monoid']"

I am not sure how to type out long division, but I get $$ (x - 2)  \mid (x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12) .$$ So I know I can have an $x^2$ for how many times $x$ goes into the leading term. Subtracting it all, I am left with $$ (x - 2  ) \mid (-x^2 - 4x + 12) .$$ I know that the leading term goes into the inner leading term $-x$ times or however you say that. $$ (x - 2 ) \mid  (- 2x + 12) .$$ Now $-2$ : $$ (x - 2 ) \mid 8 .$$ Now I do not know what to do, how did this go so wrong?

395253,Any commutative associative operation can be extended to a function on nonempty finite sets,"This is a fact we use very frequently in general mathematics when we write such notations as $1+2+3+4$ : since we know that $+$ is commutative and associative, we can just ""drop the parentheses"" and not worry about order of operations. Of course I believe this, but how does one prove this in full generality? Even stating it is giving me trouble. Here's my attempt: Assume an operation $\oplus:S\times S\to S$ is provided satisfying $x\oplus y=y\oplus x$ and $x\oplus(y\oplus z)=(x\oplus y)\oplus z$ for all $x,y,z\in S$ . Claim: Given any finite set $\emptyset\subset A\subseteq S$ , there exists a unique $z\in S$ such that for any function $f:{\cal P}(A)\to{\cal P}(A)$ which satisfies $\emptyset \subset f(B)\subset B$ for all $B\subseteq A$ with $|B|\ge 2$ and any function $g:{\cal P}(A)\to S$ which satisfies $g(\{x\})=x$ for all $x\in S$ and $g(B)=g(f(B))\oplus g(B-f(B))$ for all $|B|\ge 2$ , $g(A)=z$ . The operation $\oplus$ does not necessarily have an identity element, so we do not attempt to define an empty sum. Intuitively, this element $z$ represents the finite sum of the elements in $A$ , so if $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $f(\{1,2,3\})=\{1\}$ and $f(\{2,3\})=\{3\}$ , then $$z=g(\{1,2,3\})=g(\{1\})\oplus g(\{2,3\})=g(\{1\})\oplus (g(\{3\})\oplus g(\{2\}))=1\oplus(3\oplus 2).$$ There has got to be a better way to say that, but this is the only way I can think of to capture all the possibilities of parenthesization, and still be amenable to a formal proof. And now that I've stated it, how should I prove it? I suppose I should induct on something, but I've no idea what. Edit: The goal here is to be able to define an operation $F$ such that $F(\{x_1,\dots,x_n\})=x_1\oplus\cdots\oplus x_n$ and be assured that the operation is well defined and satisfies $F(A\cup B)=F(A)\oplus F(B)$ , when $A$ and $B$ are disjoint finite nonempty subsets of $S$ .","['notation', 'proof-writing', 'abstract-algebra', 'universal-algebra']"

all the points $x+iy\in G$ s.t $x,y\in\mathbb{Q}$. Moreover, I think that the points can be arranged s.t $$D(z_{i},r_{i})\cap D(z_{i+1},r_{i+1})\neq\emptyset$$ We first consider $D(z_{0},r_{0})$ - there is some $g_{0}:\, D(z_{0},r_{0})\to\mathbb{\mathbb{C}}$ s.t
 $g_{0}'=f$ in $D(z_{0},r_{0})$, since $f$ is holomorphic. We continue with $z_{1}$and get $\widetilde{g_{1}}$, since $g_{0}'=\widetilde{g_{1}}'$
for all points in $D(z_{0},r_{0})\cap D(z_{1},r_{1})$ then $g_{0}-\widetilde{g_{1}}$
is a constant $c$, and we can pick $g_{1}=\widetilde{g_{1}}+c$.
We take $g(z)$ will be eventually defined for every $z\in G$ as
one of the $g_{i}$'s. This construction looks a bit fishy to me, I am not sure about the
""moreover"" part and even if so, I am not totally convinced I can
arrange the constants to fit to get a holomorphic function $g$. ADDED: Instead of $$D(z_{i},r_{i})\cap D(z_{i+1},r_{i+1})\neq\emptyset$$
  we can relax the condition to be $$\cup_{i=1}^{r}D(z_{i},r_{i})\cap D(z_{i+1},r_{i+1})\neq\emptyset$$ Is my construction correct ? I would also appreciate to see another approach (maybe one that uses

$$
\cos \gamma = \cos \theta_1 \cos \theta_2 + \sin \theta_1 \sin \theta_2 \cos(\phi_1-\phi_2)
$$
Based on symmetry arguments one could argue that as the integrand is only dependent the relative angle, we can fix $\Omega_1$, integrate over $\Omega_2$, and multiply the result with $4 \pi$ to compensate for fixing $\Omega_1$. Additionally we can argue that if we fix $\Omega_1$ along the $z$ axis the integration over $\phi_2$ just gives a factor $2 \pi$. So we have,
$$
\int \text{d} \Omega_{1} \text{d} \Omega_{2} f(\gamma) = 8 \pi^{2} \int \sin \gamma \, \text{d}\gamma f(\gamma).

Then $\int_a^bF(x)g(x)dx = F(b)G(b) - F(a)G(a) - \int_a^bf(x)G(x)dx$. The proof is to put $H(x)=F(x)G(x)$ and apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to H and its derivative. The fundamental theorem of calculus is stated as: If $f \in \mathcal{R}$ on $[a,b]$ and if there is a differentiable function $F$ on $[a,b]$ s.t. $F'=f$, then $\int_a^bf(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)$.

395647,The smallest nontrivial conjugacy class in $S_n$,"Find the smallest nontrivial conjugacy class in $S_n$. For small $n$, the answer can be found by counting the permutations of each possible cycle type. The result is:
$$\begin{array}{ccc}
n & \text{smallest nontrivial class(es)} & \text{size} \\
\hline
1 & \text{none} & \\
2 & \text{transpositions} & 1 \\
3 & 3\text{-cycles} & 2 \\
4 & \text{double transpositions} & 3 \\
5 & \text{transpositions} & 10 \\
6 & \text{transpositions, triple transpositions} & 15
\end{array}$$ For $n\geq 7$, I think the unique smallest nontrivial conjugacy class in $S_n$ is given by the transpositions. The conjugacy classes in $S_n$ are given by the sets of permutations of the same cycle type. For the cycle type $\alpha = 1^{a_1} 2^{a_2} \ldots$, the size of the respective conjugacy class is known to be
$$N_\alpha = \frac{n!}{\prod_i (i^{a_i} a_i!)}.$$
In particular, the number of transpositions in $S_n$ is $\binom{n}{2}$. In this way, it remains to show the following: Let $n \geq 7$ and $\alpha$ be a partition of $n$ distinct from $1^n$ and $2^1 1^{n-2}$. Show that $N_\alpha > \binom{n}{2}$. So far I can only come up with a lengthy and technical case-by-case study.

395669,Topology of the Segre product vs. the product topology,"In general, the product topology on two (quasiprojective) varieties is not the same as the topology of the product variety given by the Segre embedding.  This is something I've often seen asserted is true, but I'm having difficulties writing down a complete proof of this fact.  What I want to prove is Let $V \subseteq \mathbb{P}^m$, $W \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ be varieties with the Zariski topology.  Then the product topology on $V \times W$ is not the same as the topology of the Segre product $\sigma(V \times W)$, unless one of the varieties is simply a finite set of points. This is an early exercise in Harris' Algebraic geometry - a first course (Exer. 2.22) and in Smith's An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry (Exer. 5.3.4).  This is likely a standard fact, but regardless I indicate the kind of partial progress I've made below (possibly red herrings) - feel free to skip the walls of text below. Firstly, this fact is easily ""proved"" when explicit varieties $V, W$ are given.  For example, if $V = W = \mathbb{P}^1$, one can simply use the diagonal in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ as an example of a Zariski-closed set in $\sigma(\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1)$ that is not closed in the product topology.  From this and other examples, I believe that in the cases that the topologies differ, the topology on $\sigma(V \times W)$ is finer than the product topology. Next, if neither $V$ nor $W$ is a finite set of points, then $\dim V, \dim W > 0$, so one may assume by restricting to a subvariety that $V$ and $W$ are actually one-dimensional irreducible varieties.  In this case, the closed sets of $V \times W$ are well-known: the closed sets in $V$ and $W$ are the empty set, the whole set, or a finite number of points, and so the closed sets in $V \times W$ are the arbitrary intersections of finite unions of the products of such sets. At this point, I see several different avenues that may lead to a proof.  The first is more of an geometric approach.  We want to find a set that is closed in $\sigma(X \times Y)$ but not $X \times Y$; might not some ""tilted"" hyperplane section do the trick?  Or perhaps we can mimick the example with $V = W = \mathbb{P}^1$.  The diagonal may not make sense in general, but if we have a nonconstant morphism $V \to W$ or $W \to V$, then we can use the graph of this morphism in place of the diagonal to conclude.  We also know that the closed sets in $\sigma(V \times W)$ are the zero locus of bihomogeneous polynomials. Another approach is to work in the (homogeneous) coordinate rings.  That is, we wish to find a proper (prime) ideal containing $I(\sigma(V \times W))$ where we do not simply add in ""products"" of polynomials in $k[V]$ and $k[W]$.  The fact that we are working with one-dimensional irreducible varieties means that the transcendence degree of $k[\sigma(V \times W)]$ is two, so one simply needs to quotient out by one transcendental element that does not correspond to a closed set already in the product topology $V \times W$.  Finally, one may exploit the fact that the Segre product is the categorical product in the category of varieties and the topological product is the categorical product in the category of spaces.  If the Segre product is the categorical product in the category of spaces too and the projection maps are the same in this category, then the ""unique"" morphism from $X \times Y$ to $\sigma(X \times Y)$ is $\sigma$ on the level of sets, so one simply needs to show that $\sigma$ is not continuous. Unfortunately, I am unable to turn any of these vague ideas into a complete proof.  Since this result is so basic, I fear that I am overlooking something simple, and I would greatly appreciate it if someone could tell me what it is I'm missing.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-geometry', 'projective-space']"

(2) Therefore, by the Limit Linearity Theorem, $\lim\limits_{x\to x_0} f(x)$ exists and we'll show it is equals $f(x_0)$. (3) We'll do this by the Precise Limit Definion: given $ \epsilon>0, \exists\delta|0<|x-x_0|<\delta$, then $0<|f(x)-f(x_0)|<\epsilon$. As this limit exists by (2), we can make $f(x)$ as close to  $f(x_0)$ as one wishes, therefore $\lim\limits_{x\to x_0} f(x)=f(x_0)$, what satisfies the condition for $f(x)$ be differentiable at  $x=x_0$.

Prove that a valid inner product on $V$ is defined with the formula $[x, y] = \langle Ax, Ay\rangle $ $L(V, W)$ = The set of all linear mappings (linear operators) from V to W To prove this, if I am correct, I need to show that the four properties of an inner products space apply on this formula: 1. $\langle x, y \rangle  = \overline{\langle y,x\rangle }$ 2. $\langle \alpha x, y\rangle  = \alpha\langle x,y\rangle $ 3. $\langle x+y,z\rangle  = \langle x,z\rangle  + \langle y,z\rangle $ 4. $\langle x,x\rangle \space \ge 0 \space \space \forall x$ 4.' $\langle x,x\rangle \space = 0 \Longleftrightarrow x=0$ 4. $ [x, x] = \langle Ax, Ax\rangle , Ax \in W$, and since $W$ is an inner product space, $\langle Ax, Ax\rangle \space \ge 0$ implies $[x, x] \ge 0$. 4.' Since A is an injection: $Ax = 0 \implies x = 0$ and since $W$ is an inner product space and $Ax \in W \implies \langle  Ax, Ax \rangle  = 0 \implies Ax = 0 \implies [x,x] = 0 \Longleftrightarrow x=0$ 3. $[x+y,z] = \langle A(x+y), Az\rangle  = A$ is linear $= \langle Ax + Ay, Az\rangle = Ax, Ay, Az \in W$ and $W$ is an inner product space $= \langle Ax, Az\rangle  + \langle Ay, Az\rangle  = [x,z] + [y,z]$ 2. $[\alpha x, y] = \langle A(\alpha x), Ay\rangle  = A$ is linear $ = \langle \alpha (Ax), Ay \rangle  = W$ is an inner product space $ = \alpha \langle Ax, Ay\rangle  = \alpha [x, y]$ 1. $[x, y] = \langle  Ax, Ay \rangle  = W$ is an inner product space $= \overline{\langle Ay, Ax\rangle } = \overline{[y, x]}$ But this seems to me a little to easy, did I maybe conclude something that can't be concluded so easily or maybe is my approach to prove this completely wrong?",['linear-algebra']

Here $k = 1$ (ii) a set $U$ is convex if for any 2 points $x, y$ in $U$, the segment joining $x$ and $y$ is totally inside $U$ (iii) function $f$ is Lipschitz if there is a bound $M$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq M |x-y|$ (2)By a theorem in my book: if function $f \in C^1$ on an open & convex set $U$, then for any 2
  points $x$ and $y$ in $U$, there is a point $s$ lying on the segment
  joining $x$ and $y$ such that $f(x) - f(y) = Df(s) * (x - y)$ I firstly have a feeling that I may need this theorem in the proof, but I can't see the connection between my desired bound $M$ with $Df(s)$.  So I tried to think of other ideas and ... (3) It turns out that by all the given information, I think if I can show function $f$ is convex, then I'm done because there is a theorem which said: a convex function on a open, convex set $U$ should be Lipschitz on $U$, thus I think it must also be Lipschitz on any subset of $U$, either that subset is compact or not. However, how can I prove function $f$ is convex, based on given information?  I have a feeling that I have to use the fact that set $U$ is convex, but then I'm stuck on how to proceed further >_> *Would someone please help me on this question?

   differentiable in $a$ and $g$ differentiable in $f(a)$, then $F$ is
   differentiable in $a$ and $F'(a)=g'(f(a)) f'(a)$. I have been given a short proof, but I do not understand every step of it. We have $f(a+h) = f(a) + f'(a)h + o(|h|)$ and $g(f(a)+k) = g(f(a)) + g'(f(a))k + o(|k|)$ as $h,k \to 0$. Thus $\begin{align} F(a+h)=(g \circ f)(a+h) &= g(f(a+h)) \\

This last one isn't included in the proof, but I expect that's would have been something trivial. I've been trying to work this out with the definitions of big o en little o, but to no prevail. It's confusion to me how I can do computations with big o and little o, since you can't really perform algebraic operations with them and it's more like a function property.

For $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$, I found that there are 12 automorphisms. Here is the following link that relates to the problem I am doing. Based on the solution: Lemma : If $\alpha$ is an automorphism of group $G$ and $G$ has generators $x$ and $y$ with orders $n$ and $m$, respectively then $\alpha(x)$ and $\alpha(y)$ are also generators for $G$ with orders $n$ and $m$. Proof: First, let us show that the orders agree.  If $g \in G$ has order $n$, let $a = \alpha(g) \in G$ have order $m$.  Then, $a^m = 1$ but by applying $\alpha^{-1} \in \mathrm{Aut}(G)$, we get $g^m = 1$.  However, $g$ has order $n$, so $n$ must divide $m$.  Similarly, $g^n = 1$ and applying $\alpha$, we note that $a^n = 1$, and so we conclude $n = m$. Secondly, since any element of $G$ can be written as a product of $x$'s and $y$'s, and $\alpha$ is a surjective homomorphism, it follows that any element of $G$ can also be written as a product of $\alpha(x)$ and $\alpha(y)$, hence they generate $G$. Using this Lemma (or a similar argument), we note that an automorphism of $D_4$ must send $y$ to $y, xy, x^2y$ or $x^3y$ and $x$ to $x$ or $x^3$.  Any such pairing is possible, thus there are $2 \cdot 4 = 8$ such automorphisms... (The notations that someone use are different from what I denote.) The question I have is: Why are there 8 automorphisms?  Shouldn't there be 12 automorphisms?  Here is what I have: $$e \mapsto e$$
$$x \mapsto \text{ either } \{x,y^2, xy^2\}$$
$$y \mapsto \text{ either } \{y, y^3, xy, xy^3\}$$ Then, there are $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 12$ automorphisms. Any advices or comments?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
