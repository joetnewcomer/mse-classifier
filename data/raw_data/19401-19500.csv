161893,Irreducible polynomial over an algebraically closed field of characteristic distinct from 2,"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field such that $\textrm{char(k)} \neq 2$ and let $n$ be a fixed positive integer greater than $3$ Suppose that $m$ is a positive integer such that $3 \leq m \leq n$. Is it always true that $f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{m})=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\cdots+x_{m}^{2}$ is irreducible over $k[x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}]$? I think yes. For $m=3$ we need to check that $f(x,y,z)=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$ is irreducible, yes? can't we use Eisenstein as follows? Note $y+iz$ divides $y^{2}+z^{2}$ and $y+iz$ is irreducible over $k[y,z]$ and $(y+iz)^{2}$ does not divide $y^{2}+z^{2}$. Therefore $f(x,y,z)=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$ is irreducible. Now we induct on $m$. Suppose the result holds for $m$ and let us show
it holds for $m+1$. So we must look at the polynomial $x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{m}^{2}+x_{m+1}^{2}$. Consider the ring $k[x_{m+1}][x_{1},..,x_{m}]$, 
we have a monic polynomial and by hypothesis $x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{m}^{2}$ is irreducible over $k[x_{1},\ldots,x_{m}]$ and $(x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{m}^{2}
)^{2}$
does not divides $x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{m}^{2}$ so Eisenstein applies again and we are done. Question(s): Is this OK? In case not, can you please provide a proof?","['abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

161902,Finitely additive function on a product of semirings of sets,"Let X be a set.
Let $\Delta$ be a semiring on X.
Let $\mu$ be a function $\Delta \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.
We say $\mu$ is a finitely additive function on $\Delta$ if it satisfies the following condition (*). (*) Let $A, A_1、．．．、A_m \in \Delta$.
Suppose $A$ is a disjoint union of $A_1、．．．、A_m$.
Then $\mu(A) = \mu(A_1) + ... + \mu(A_m)$ Let X and Y be sets.
Let $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$ be semirings on X and Y respectively.
Let $\mu$ and $\nu$ be finitely additive functions on X and Y respectively.
Let $\Sigma$ be the set {$A \times B: A \in \Delta, B \in \Gamma$}. Define a function $\lambda: \Sigma \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by
$\lambda(A \times B) = \mu(A) \times \nu(B)$. Then, is the following statement true? $\Sigma$ is a semiring on $X \times Y$ and $\lambda$ is finitely additive on it. EDIT I think the above result follows immediately from the following lemma whose proof I hope is correct. Lemma Let $X$ be a set.
Let $\Delta$ be a semiring on X.
Let $I_1, ..., I_n$ be elements of $\Delta$.
Then there exist $J_1, ..., J_m \in \Delta$ with the following properties. (1) $J_1, ..., J_m$ are mutually disjoint. (2) $I_1 \cup ... \cup I_n = J_1 \cup ... \cup J_m$ (3) Each $I_k$ is a union of a subset of {$J_1, ... ,J_m$}. Proof:
Let $A = I_1 \cup ... \cup I_n$.
Let $S = \{1, 2, ... , n\}$.
Let $T = \{i_1, ... , i_r\}$ be a non-empty subset of $S$.
Let $\{j_1, ... , j_s\} = S - T$.
Let $J_T = I_{i_1} \cap ... \cap I_{i_r} \cap (A - I_{j_1}) \cap ... \cap(A - I_{j_s})$.
Let $P(S)$ be the power set of $S$.
Then $I_1 \cup ... \cup I_n$ is the disjoint union of {$J_T; T \in P(S) - \{\emptyset\}$}.
Each $I_k$ is a union of a subset of {$J_T; T \in P(S) - \{\emptyset\}$}.
Since $\Delta$ is a semiring, each $J_T$ is a disjoint union of elements of $\Delta$.
QED EDIT This is an application of the above result.",['measure-theory']
161910,Most general $A \subseteq \mathbb R$ to define derivative of $f: A \to \mathbb R$?,"I was looking up the definition of the derivative in several books, and what was making me uneasy was the first sentence, generally along the lines of ""let $f$ be defined on..."". They don't seem to be able to agree on what $f$ should be defined on. Most books say ""interval""; one says ""open set""; another just says ""let $f$ be a real-valued function""; etc. So I decided to do a little investigation. At the end of the day, we always define the derivative as the limit of a difference quotient (two versions), so we need to look into limits of functions. It turns out that the limit of $f$ at $a$ is only defined for $a \in (\operatorname{dom} f)'$ (we'll denote the set of cluster points of $A$ by $A'$ for convenience), because otherwise, the $0 < |x - a| < \delta$ part of the definition can be made false by choosing $\delta$ small enough to isolate $a$, thereby making the implication vacuously true, which gives non-unique limits, but we don't want that. So at this point, we know that $a$ must be a cluster point of the domain of the difference quotient. A slight digression: It's easy to show that if $B$ is a finite set, then $A' = (A \cup B)' = (A \setminus B)'$. (That is, ""adding"" or ""subtracting"" a finite number of points doesn't affect the ""stickiness"" of a set.) Let $A \subseteq \mathbb R$ and let $f: A \to \mathbb R$. For each $a \in A$, we can define a difference quotient function $q_a: A \setminus \{a\} \to \mathbb R$ by $$q_a(x) = \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}.$$ Now, (in a rather perverted pseudo-self-referential manner), we can define $$f': \{a \in A \cap A': \lim_{x \to a} q_a(x) \in \mathbb R \} \to \mathbb R \qquad \text{by} \qquad f'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} q_a(x).$$ We need $a \in A$ because $f(a)$ is needed to evaluate $q_a$, and we need $a \in A' = (A \setminus \{a\})' = (\operatorname{dom} q_a)'$ for the limit to be defined. So really, derivatives can be defined on sets that are much more general than intervals: we really only need $\operatorname{dom} f \cap (\operatorname{dom} f)' \neq \varnothing$ in order to talk about the derivative of $f$ at some point (of course, the derivative itself need not exist, but at least we can talk about it not existing). And then I started getting worried... The function $f: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$, defined by $$f(x) = \begin{cases} x, & x \in \mathbb Q, \\ 0, & x \notin \mathbb Q, \end{cases}$$ has no derivative anywhere. But if we restrict the domain to $\mathbb Q$, then suddenly every point is differentiable with derivative $1$? Now I'm starting to wonder if I made some stupid mistake in the development above, but I can't seem to find it. So the question is, is the bolded statement above true?",['calculus']
161929,"cardinality of $E^F$, $E, F = \emptyset$","My textbook ( Naive Set Theory ) asks the reader to show that $\left| E^F \right|$ = $\left| E \right| ^ \left| F \right|$ for all finite sets. In passing to induction, I noticed that this would imply that $0^0 = 1$, since there exists the trivial empty function (i.e., $\emptyset \times \emptyset = \emptyset$). The definition of exponentiation in $\omega$ says that $(\forall m \in \omega $ $(m^0 = 1))$, so this seems reasonable. Is this correct, or should this case be discarded? If it is correct, is it correct in $\omega$ only, or everywhere?","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"
161937,What conditions guarantee that all maximal ideals have the same height?,"It fails in general that all maximal ideals in a commutative ring with unity have the same height. It's easy to construct a counter-example when the ring is NOT an integral domain (consider the coordinate ring of a line union a surface). The intuition is that the dimensions at different points are different. It is indeed true that all maximal ideals have the same height when the ring $A$ is a finitely generated algebra over some field $k$ and does not have any nonzero zero-divisors. This height equals the transcendence degree of $A$ over $k$.
However, in general, even when the ring is a Noetherian integral domain, the statement may be false. A counter-example can be found in Atiyah and Macdonald's Introduction to Commutative Algebra , Exercise 4, Chapter 11 on Pg 126. This ring is ""large"" in some sense. My question is that is there some more suitable condition that guarantees that all maximal prime ideals in an integral domain have the same height?

161946,Proving a commutative ring can be embedded in any quotient ring.,"Here's the exercise, as quoted from B.L. van der Waerden's Algebra , Show that any commutative ring $\mathfrak{R}$ (with or without a zero divisor) can be embedded in a ''quotient ring"" consisting of all quotients $a/b$, with $b$ not a divisor of zero. More generally, $b$ may range over any set $\mathfrak{M}$ of non-divisors of zero which is closed under multiplication (that is, $b_1$, $b_2$ is in $\mathfrak{M}$ when $b_1$ and $b_2$ are). The result is a quotient ring $\mathfrak{R}_{\mathfrak{M}}$. I'm not sure if I am stuck or if I am overthinking. My answer goes like this: Commutative rings without zero divisors are integral domains as defined in Algebra and, by removing all $a/b$ which are not in the the commutative ring $R$ from the field $R \hookrightarrow Q$ where $Q$ is the field of all quotients $a/b$, one shows that any commutative ring without zero divisors can be embedded in a quotient ring. (This is more rigorously outlined in Algebra itself.) Now what has me confused is how this case differs from a case with zero divisors. Doesn't the exact same logic hold for a commutative ring with zero divisors? The only thing that I think zero divisors would interfere with is solving equations of the form $ax=b$ and $ya=b$ since there aren't inverses of zero divisors. However, we do not need to show that they can be embedded in a quotient field . We're only showing they can be embedded in a quotient ring. So, there's really no issue here and we apply the same approach as above. Now, as for the last part, I think that all that needs to be said is that if the set $\mathfrak{M}$ wasn't closed under multiplication, neither would the ""ring"" be and hence it would not be a ring by definition. Therefore, $\mathfrak{M}$ has to be closed and any commutative ring where $b$ ranges over any set of non-divisors of zero can be embedded in a quotient ring. I guess my real issue here is that I can't tell if I'm overthinking or underthinking. Does anyone care to elucidate this for me?","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

However, I managed to modify it to show that $A$ is closed iff $A$ contains all of its cluster points (see below, marked with [] ). What went wrong here? If the latter is false in general, in what special cases is it true (I heard it's true in metric spaces)? The proof: ($\Rightarrow$): Suppose $A$ is closed and $x_0 \in X \setminus A$. Take $U:= X\setminus A$, an open set containing $x_0$. Now  $U\cap A =\emptyset$, so $x_0$ is not an accumulation point.
[$x_0$ is not an accumulation point and so it is not a cluster point either.] ($\Leftarrow$): Suppose $A$ is not closed, then $X\setminus A$ is not open. $\exists x_0 \in X\setminus A$ such that no open set $U\ni x_0$ is contained in $X\setminus A$, i.e. any open set $U\ni x_0$ satisfies $U\cap A \neq \emptyset$.

162175,Does the curvature determine the metric?,"Here I asked the question whether the curvature deterined the metric. Since I am unfortunately completely new to Riemannian geometry, I wanted to ask, if somebody could give and explain a concrete example to me , as far as the following is concerned: At the MO page (as cited above) I got the following answer to the question Given a compact Riemannian manifold M, are there two metrics g1 and g2, which are not everywhere flat, such that they are not isometric to one another, but that there is a diffeomorphism which preserves the curvature?
If the answer is yes:
Can we chose M to be a compact 2-manifold? On the positive side, if $M$ is compact of dimension $\ge 3$ and has nowhere constant sectional curvature, then combination of results of Kulkarni and Yau show that 
  a diffeomorphism preserving sectional curvature is necessarily an isometry. Concerning 2-dimensional counter-examples: First of all, every surface which admits an open subset where curvature is (nonzero) constant would obviously yield a counter-example. Thus, I will assume now that curvature is nowhere constant. Kulkarni refers to Kreyszig's ""Introduction to Differential Geometry and Riemannian Geometry"", p. 164, for a counter-example attributed to  Stackel and Wangerin. You probably can get the book through interlibrary loan if you are in the US. I looked up the example in Kreyszig's ""Introduction to Differential Geometry and Riemannian Geometry"", p. 164: If we rotate the curve $x_3=\log x_1$ about the $x_3$-axis in space, 
we obtain the surface of revolution $X(u_1,u_2)=(u_2\cos(u_1), u_2\sin(u_1),\log(u_2))$, $u_2>0$.
This is diffeomorphic to the helicoid $X(u_1,u_2) =(u_2\cos(u_1),u_2\sin(u_1),u_1)$. I think, these manifolds are not compact (but I assumed compactness of the manifold in my question on MO).

Proof: The set S of all such finite sequences can be characterized by the equation 
$$S=\bigcup_{n \in N} A^{n+1}$$ Since A is countable, we have a function f mapping A one-to-one into N. The basic idea is to map S one-to-one into N by assigning to $(a_0,a_1,...,a_m)$ the number $2^{f(a_0)+1}3^{f(a_1)+1}\cdot ... \cdot p_m^{f(a_m)+1}$, where $p_m$ is the $(m+1)$st prime. This suffers from the defect that this assignment might not be well-defined. For conceivably there could be $(a_0,a_1,...,a_m)=(b_0,b_1,...,b_n)$, with $a_i$ and $b_j$ in A but with $m\neq n$. But this is not serious; just assign to each member of S the smallest number obtainable in the above fashion. This gives us a well-defined map; it is easy to see that it is one-to-one. Note: P is a finite sequence of members of A iff for some positive integer $n$, we have $P=(x_1,...,x_n)$, where each $x_i \in A$. First of all, I cannot understand why the former assignment might not be well-defined and the latter assignment is well-defined. Secondly, I cannot understand what Enderton means by ""just assign to each member of S the smallest number obtainable in the above fashion"". By the way, is $(a,b,c,d) = ((a,b),(c,d))$ true?

If the answer is yes:
Can we chose M to be a compact 2-manifold? For concrete 2-dimensional counter-example see page 328 of Kulkarni's paper ""Curvature and metric"", Annals of Math, 1970. Weinstein's argument there shows that every Riemannian surface provides a counter-example (using flow orthogonal to the gradient of the curvature). Here is the Weinstein's argument: Consider a Riemannian surface $(S,g)$ and let $K$ denote the curvature function. Let $X$ be a nonzero vector field on $S$ orthogonal to the gradient field of $K$. (Such $X$ always exists.) Now, consider the flow $F_t$ along $X$. Then $F_t$ will preserve the curvature but will not be (for most metrics $g$ and vector fields $X$) isometric. For instance, $F_t$ cannot be isometric if genus of $S$ is at least $2$ or if $X$ has more than 2 zeros. Since I am unfortunately completely new to Riemannian geometry, I wanted to ask, if somebody could explain that to me in detail, maybe with the help of a concrete example.

162561,Two sums for $\pi$,"I was looking for a simple way to evaluate the integral $\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}dx$ ( a belated look at this question ). There are symmetries to be exploited, for one thing. So I had an idea, but the idea depends, optimistically,  on two expressions for $\pi$ that I cannot prove, and my question is whether anyone sees reasonable proofs of either expression (1, 2 below). Put $$\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}dx = \int_0^\pi \sum_{k=0}^{k=\infty} \left\{\frac{\sin x}{x + 2 k \pi }-\frac{\sin x }{x+2k\pi+\pi}\right\} \, dx$$ The intuition behind this step is that as we make our way around the unit circle from 0 to $\pi$, for each angle $\alpha$ we have an angle $\alpha + \pi$ for which the value of $\frac{\sin x} {x}$will be smaller and negative. No need to integrate beyond $\pi$, and for angles greater than $2\pi$ we are simply dividing up the original integral's range by adding multiples of $\pi$ to the value of $x$. WLOG  we can form Riemann sums by dividing the range of integration into an even number of equi-angle subranges $dx_n$. For example, if $n = 6$, we have $$\int_0^\pi \sum_{k=0}^{k=\infty}\sin x \left\{\frac{1}{x + 2 k \pi }-\frac{1 }{x+2k\pi+\pi}\right\} \, dx$$ $$\approx \left\{ \sum_{k=0}^\infty  \sum_{n=1}^6  \sin \left( \frac{n\pi}{6}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\pi}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\frac{n}{6} + 2k}-\frac{1}{\frac{n}{6}+2k+1}\right) \right\} \left\{ \frac{\pi}{6} \right\}.$$ Taking this as true, we note that pairs of summands of the Riemann sums symmetric about $\frac{\pi}{2}$ sum to $1$, and the value of the summand at $\frac{\pi}{2}$ is $1/2$. Again, taking this as true, we have that $$\sum f(x_n) = \frac{1}{2} + 1\cdot \frac{n-2}{2} + \sin\pi\cdot f(\pi) = \frac{n-1}{2},$$
and 
$$\sum f(x_n) \, dx_n =  \left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{\pi}{n}.$$ So for the approximation above for $n = 6$, we expect a value of about $\frac{5 \pi}{12}$ for high $k$. In words, we are only counting n - 1 summands, since the last summand at $\pi$ is $0$. Since we divided the interval into $n$ subintervals, we are stuck with the sum above and the conditional limit (conditioned at least on the truth of the two limits below): $$\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x} \, dx = \lim_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{n-1}{2}\cdot \frac{\pi}{n} = \frac{\pi}{2}.$$ The problem is this: we need to prove, to begin with, that $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(\frac{ 1}{\pi/2 + 2\pi k} - \frac{1}{\pi/2 + 2k\pi + \pi}\right) = \frac{1}{2}$$ or $$ \frac{1}{\pi}\sum \frac{1}{1/2 + 2k}- \frac{1}{1/2 + 2k\pi +1}= \frac{1}{2},$$ that is, (1) $\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{4}{3+16k+16k^2}= \frac{\pi}{2}$. We must also prove for $0< j < n$ that (2) $\sin (\frac{j\pi}{n})( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (\frac{ 1}{\frac{j\pi}{n} + 2\pi k} - \frac{1}{\frac{j\pi}{n} + 2k\pi + \pi})  + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (\frac{ 1}{\frac{(n-j)\pi}{n} + 2\pi k} - \frac{1}{\frac{(n-j)\pi}{n} + 2k\pi + \pi}))= 1$. or , factoring $\frac{1}{ \pi}$ out of the sum and mutiplying: $$\sin \left( \frac{j\pi}{n}\right)\left( \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{\frac{j}{n} + 2 k} - \frac{1}{\frac{j}{n} + 2k + 1}\right)  + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left( \frac{ 1}{\frac{(n-j)}{n} + 2 k} - \frac{1}{\frac{(n-j)}{n} + 2k + 1}\right)\right)= \pi.$$ (1) might be a special case of something at Wolfram's site, but I didn't spot it. (2) looks messy, but maybe induction? If this is otherwise correct, I think one could work back from the relations for $\pi$ and establish the value of the integral. It is important not to forget that k starts at 0. Edit: the following is equivalent to (2) and maybe easier to scan. For $0<r<1$, $$(2) \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac {2(\sin \pi r)(1+4k+4k^2-r+r^2) }{(1+2k+r)(1+2k-r)(2+2k-r)(2k+r)} = \pi$$ This was derived assuming r rational, but I don't think it matters.","['pi', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"

So trying to figure this out definitely made my brain hurt.  I believe that as a subspace of $\mathbb{R_l} \times \mathbb{R}$, all non-vertical straight lines just inherit the lower limit topology $\mathbb{R_l}$, while vertical lines inherit the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$.  As for $\mathbb{R_l} \times \mathbb{R_l}$, as far as I can tell, the only difference is that now all straight lines, including vertical ones, inherit the lower limit topology. My reasoning was basically that for $\mathbb{R_l} \times \mathbb{R}$, open sets on the line all have an initial left end point, since the x-coordinate of this left end point is always captured by the open sets [a,b) in $\mathbb{R_l}$, and this in turn drags the y-coordinate of the initial left end point along for the ride (so to speak).  This is true in all but the vertical line case where there is no shift in the horizontal direction and thus the topology is inherited strictly from $\mathbb{R}$. As for $\mathbb{R_l} \times \mathbb{R_l}$ it's basically the same argument except now the vertical lines inherit from $\mathbb{R_l}$ as well. Can someone let me know whether I've reasoned correctly?

162660,Algebraic Topology Challenge: Homology of an Infinite Wedge of Spheres,"So the following comes to me from an old algebraic topology final that got the best of me.  I wasn't able to prove it due to a lack of technical confidence, and my topology has only deteriorated since then.  But, I'm hoping maybe someone can figure out the proof as I've always been interested in seeing it all at once! Let $E_\infty$ denote the 2-D analogue of the Hawaiian Earring, i.e. $$E_\infty = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 | \hspace{2mm} (x-1/n)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1/n^2\}.$$ The object of the exercise is to show that even though $E_\infty$ is 2-dimensional, $H_3(E_\infty) \neq 0$ , which I find interesting even though I know it's not a CW-complex. Parts of the proof were helped along by my professor to serve as a road map for the solution, but sadly I'm still lost in the driveway filling in some of the remaining bits: Let $h: S^3 \longrightarrow S^2$ denote the Hopf map i.e. the attaching map for the 4-cell in $\mathbb{C}P^2$ .  One can readily observe that there is a continuous map $\tilde{h}: S^3 \longrightarrow E_\infty$ so that the projection of $\tilde{h}$ to any $S^2$ in $E_\infty$ is homotopic to the Hopf map. Let $C_\tilde{h}$ denote the mapping cone of $\tilde{h}$ .  Then we have a mapping cones that looks something like a LOT of $\mathbb{C}P^2$ 's. (1) First we must prove that $H^2(C_\tilde{h})$ contains a subgroup $\mathbb{Z}<\zeta_1, \zeta_2, ...>$ and $H^4(C_\tilde{h}) \cong \mathbb{Z}<\eta>$ where $$\zeta_i \cup \zeta_i = \eta \text{ and } \zeta_i \cup \zeta_j = 0 \text{ for } i \neq j.$$ (I suspect that this comes in part from the cup product structure on $\mathbb{C}P^2$ ). Now let $[S^3]$ denote the fundamental class of $S^3$ . Assumption: Suppose that $\tilde{h}_* = 0 \in H_3(E_\infty)$ .  Under this assumption, there is a finite simplicial complex $X$ with boundary $S^3$ so that $\tilde{h}$ extends to a map $k: X \longrightarrow E_\infty$ .  Let $Y = X \cup \mathbb{D}^4$ where $\mathbb{D}^4$ is glued to $S^3$ in the obvious way.  Then extending $k$ , we have another map $l: Y \longrightarrow C_\tilde{h}$ sending the $B^4$ to the cone $S^3 \times [0,1]/ S^3 \times 1$ . (2) Here it must be proven that $l^*(\eta)$ is a nontrivial element of $H^4(Y)$ . (I truly do not see how to do this, but it seems like it would be true [here ""seems"" doesn't really mean anything]). (3) And now it needs to be shown that the infinitely many $l^*(\zeta_i)$ are all linearly independent. (This would seem to follow from naturality of the cup product in some way). If I could prove these things, it would only remain to observe that $Y$ came from gluing to a finite simplicial complex, and therefore it is itself a finite simplicial complex.  Hence $H^2(Y)$ is finitely generated, so we arrive at the desired contradiction, which is awesome since we have found a nontrivial element in the third homology group of a 2-D object!  Awesome! Anyways, if anyone could complete this proof in its entirety, I would be supremely grateful.  I assure you that I will upvote it a hundred times over! Even though the last 99 won't really do much. Also sorry that there are sort of several questions embedded in one.

Work/attempt at a solution: First, although I have a limited experience with this type of integral, I believe the function can be re-written as follows: $$f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{x^{2(2n+1)}(2n+1)!}$$ If I have this correctly (I attempted to extrapolate from an integral table I found regarding $\sin\left(\dfrac1x \right)$, but please correct me if I am wrong), I can utilize Dominated Convergence to show the integral exists. That is, If $f_1,f_2,...$ are measurable functions and $|f_n|\le g$ for $\mu$-integrable function, $g$, and if $f_n\to f$,  $\mu$-a.e, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}\int f_n d\mu\to\int fd\mu$. First, I need to show measurability. I believe that continuity on the interval in question, $(0,\infty)$, is sufficient to show measurability, correct? Next, define $$S_n(x):=\sum_{n=0}^{t}\frac{(-1)^n}{x^{2(2n+1)}(2n+1)!}\to f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{x^{2(2n+1)}(2n+1)!}$$ Then, define $g(x)=\dfrac1x\ge |f_n|,\forall x>0$ and therefore conclude by Dominated Convergence Theorem, that $\displaystyle \int_{(0,\infty)}\sin \left(\dfrac1{x^2} \right)d\mu$ exists. Please comment, add answers, critique, tell me where I made mistakes, etc. I am learning this on my own so any and all improvements are welcome. From here I need to show whether this integral is finite or infinite. Is there a way to show this without an explicit calculation of the integral?","['measure-theory', 'convergence-divergence', 'integration', 'real-analysis']"

162773,Minimizing a two variable functions on a compact when one of the partial differentiate never gets null.,"I have a function $f$ defined on $]0,+\infty[\times[0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$. For the moment let us say that it is smooth enough. I am looking to find a minimum of this function. What I was told to do (but I do not think it is right, though I cannot find a counter example) is to: Compute $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y) = 0$, this gives me a unique $x_{\min} = h(y)$, then to study $g: y \mapsto f(h(y),y)$, and to see when it is minimum. My questions: Is it right? If yes, do you know the theorem I should look for? Otherwise, do you have a counter example (even if it means different hypothesis)? If it is true with a function smooth enough, can you tell me the minimal hypothesis needed (and a minimal counter example)? EDIT: I am especially interested in the minimal hypothesis that make this true, and a minimal counter example when those hypothesis are not matched (questions 3 and 4). Thanks Additional informations:
there is $a,b>0$, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y) = a - bx$. (meaning the minimum seems to be necessarily for $y=0$ or $y=1$, depending on $x$ so here it works). I know of the theorem stating that we should look for every point $(x_0,y_0)$ such that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0) =\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0) = 0$, but in this example we never have this condition for the second variable. Do you know of another theorem valid on a compact?","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"

This is what I did: (1) $H$  must be of the form $\mathbb{Z}/3^{k_{1}}\mathbb{Z} \oplus\mathbb{Z}/3^{k_{2}}\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}/3^{k_{3}}\mathbb{Z}$ (2) WLOG, $0 \leq k_{1} \leq 6$, $0 \leq k_{2} \leq 5$, $0 \leq k_{3} \leq 2$, (The order obiously doesn't matter because a change of order will be isomorphic) Also, $|G/H|=3^3=3^{13}/(3^{{k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}}}) \Rightarrow k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}=10$ Thus, by choosing $k_{i}$ we can find all possibilities. However, I have a few questions: Is (1) justified? Why $\mathbb{Z}/3^{k_{1}}\mathbb{Z} \oplus\mathbb{Z}/3^{k_{2}}\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}/3^{k_{3}}\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}/3^{k_{4}}\mathbb{Z}$ isn't possible? Is (2) justified?

162794,Maximum Likelihood Estimation of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,"I am wondering whether an analytical expression of the maximum likelihood estimates of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is available. The setup is the following: Consider a one-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ with $X_0=x$ for some $x\in\mathbb{R}$, i.e. $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ solves the SDE
$$
\mathrm{d} X_t=\theta(\mu-X_t)\,\mathrm{d} t + \eta\,\mathrm{d} W_t,\quad X_0=x
$$
where $(W_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is a standard Wiener process and $\eta,\theta>0$, $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$. If $\lambda=(\eta,\theta,\mu)$ is the vector of parameters, then the transition densities are known and if $p_{\lambda}(t,x,\cdot)$ denotes the density of $X_t$ (remember $X_0=x$) with respect to the Lebesgue-measure, then
$$
p_{\lambda}(t,x,y)=(2\pi\beta)^{-1/2}\exp\left(-\frac{(y-\alpha)^2}{2\beta}\right),\quad y\in\mathbb{R},
$$
where $\alpha=\mu+(x-\mu)e^{-\theta t}$ and $\beta=\frac{\eta^2}{2\theta}(1-e^{-2\theta t})$. Suppose we have observed an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in equidistant time-instances (where the parameter $\lambda$ is unknown), i.e. the vector of observations is given by
$$
\mathbf{x}=\{x_0,x_{\Delta},\ldots,x_{N\Delta}\},
$$
where $x_0=x$ and $\Delta>0$ and $N+1$ is the number of observations. Then by the Markov property of $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ we have that the log-likelihood function is given by
$$
l(\lambda)=l(\theta,\eta,\mu;\mathbf{x})=\sum_{i=1}^N \log\left(p_{\lambda} (\Delta,x_{(i-1)\Delta},x_{i\Delta})\right).
$$
Now i am asking if it is possible to maximize this expression with respect to $\lambda=(\eta,\theta,\mu)$ simultaneously and if so, how would one go about doing this. If anyone can point me in the direction of a paper/book where this is shown, it would be much appreciated.

162830,Probability density function of the integral of a continuous stochastic process,"I am interested in whether there is a general method to calculate the pdf of the integral of a stochastic process that is continuous in time. My specific example: I am studying a stochastic given process given by $X(t)=\int\limits_{0}^{t}\cos(B(s))\,\text{d}s$, where $B(t)$ is the Wiener process, which is normally distributed over an interval of length $\tau$ with zero mean and variance $\tau$: $B(t+\tau)-B(t)\sim\mathcal{N}(0, \tau)$. I am able to calculate the first and second moments of $X(t)$, see: Expectation value of a product of an Ito integral and a function of a Brownian motion A couple of thoughts on the matter: 1) Integrals of Gaussian continuous stochastic processes, such as the Wiener process can be considered as the limit of a sum of Gaussians and are hence themselves Gaussian.  Since $\cos(B(s))$ is not Gaussian, this doesn't seem to help here. 2) If we can derive an expression for the characteristic function of the process $X(t)$, then we can theoretically invert this to obtain the pdf.  The Feynman-Kac formula enables us to describe the characteristic function in terms of a PDE.  If this PDE has a unique analytic solution then we can make use of this.  In my specific example, this is not the case - the PDE obtained has no analytic solution.  I can provide more detail on this point if required.
