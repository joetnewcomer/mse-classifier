524675,Show that $F+G$ is closed when $G$ a closed subspace of normed space $E$ and $F$ a finite dimensional subspace of $E$.,"Question: Let $E$ be a normed space. Let $G$ be a closed subspace of $E$ and let $F$ be a finite dimensional subspace of $E$. Show that $F+G$ is a subspace of $E$ and is closed. I'm having trouble in showing $F+G$ to be closed. I know that $F$ is itself closed and complete, as it is a finite dimensional subspace of a normed space, and that if $F$ were compact that $G+F$ would be closed. I also know that the closed unit ball of any finite dimensional normed space is compact. I tried two methods. One was to take a convergent sequence $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ in $G+F$. Then we can write $x_n = f_n + g_n$ where $f_n$ and $g_n$ are sequences in $F$ and $G$ respectively, and I attempted to find a way to force the individual components $f_n$ and $g_n$ inside the unit ball which would enable me to say that they had convergent subsequences. I couldn't see how to do this, however. The other thought was to try and show that $F$ is compact, but I don't see a way to do this as I can't imagine it to be simply true without some other conditions on $F$. Are one of these methods the right way to go? Or should I go another direction? I would appreciate any help I can get, although I would prefer not to be presented with a full proof so that I can do some work for myself.

524732,Simple 2D Voronoi Diagram Question with 3 Points,"This is a HW question for the course MAT480 (Mathematical Modelling I) at Athabasca University. I'm taking this distance course for credit in order to graduate sooner. Having a hard time putting all pieces together. Question A business park occupies a square area with sides of length 2M . Two copy shops are located symmetrically on the north-south line that bisects this square, at positions (0, +d) and (0, -d) in Cartesian co-ordinates, with the origin at the centre of the square. Assume that a third copy shop plans to locate at a position (r,0) Taking d = pM and r = qM with $0\le p , q\le 1$, use a Voronoi analysis to compute the area of the territory whose points are closest to this new shop. You will need to consider three separate cases. a. Show that these three cases are distinguished by the conditions: Case 1: $0\le p \le q \le 1$ Case 2: $0 \le \sqrt{1+p^2} - 1\le q \le p \le 1$ Case 3: $0 \le q \le \sqrt{1+p^2} -1  \le p \le 1$ What I have figured out I spent about countless hours figuring out what I have so far, and 1 hour with one very kind teacher at University of Ottawa too. Here: Scale: instead of dealing with the original square of area $4M^2$, I simply use a square of area of 4 $units^2$ (i.e. first quadrant is unit square.) The above makes us deal with points at $(0, \pm p)$ and $(q, 0)$. First Quadrant: I'm only looking at the first quadrant (perhaps second when needed) to compute area. Then multiply by two, everything is symmetrical below. Points: new shop $(q, 0)$ is P , two old shops are S1 $(0, p)$ and S2 $(0, -p)$ Let $l$ be the line of the Voronoi diagram that ""cuts"" through first quadrant diagonally. This line is all the middle points between S1 and P and, as a function of $x$ is simply: $$
l = \frac{p^2 - q^2}{2p} + x \frac{q}{p}
$$ Let Q be the point where the Voronoi vertices meet. It's the point at same distance of P , S1 and S2 . We note that Q lays on the x-axis (it's the intersect of $l$) and has coordinates $(x_Q,0)$ Thus: $$
x_Q = \frac{q^2 - p^2}{2q}
$$ Let W be the point where $l$ intersects with the line $y=1$. W has coordinates $(x_W, 1)$ Thus: $$
x_W = \frac{p}{q} + x_Q = \frac{p}{q} \left( 1 + \frac{q^2 - p^2}{2p} \right)
$$ Let Z be the point where $l$ intersects with the line $x=1$. Z has coordinates $(1, y_Z)$ Thus: $$
y_Z =  \frac{q}{p} + \frac{p^2 - q^2}{2p}
$$ Case 1 Now, as you can probably envision, the difference between the three cases is really a matter of ""how"" the area is computed. What I can completely understand, right of the start is that Case 1: $0\le p \le q \le 1$ is that only time when the origin DOES NOT belong to P territory. We noticed that here, $x_Q \ge 0$ (obvious since $q \ge p$) and that $x_W \leq 1$. Here's why: $$
x_W \le 1
$$
$$
\frac{p}{q} + x_Q \le 1
$$
$$
\frac{p}{q} \le 1 - x_Q
$$
$$
p \le q - qx_Q
$$
$$
p \le q
$$ So the area is simply ""area triangle"" + ""area rectangle"" times 2: the area of the rectangle triangle of height 1 running from $x_Q$ to $x_W$ PLUS the area of the rectangle of height 1 running from $x_W$ to 1. (mult by 2). I got: $$
2 \left[ \frac{(x_W - x_Q)(1)}{2} + (1-x_W)(1) \right] = x_W - x_Q + 2 - 2x_W =  2 - x_Q - x_W = 2 - x_Q - \left(\frac{p}{q} + x_Q\right) = 2 - 2x_Q - \frac{p}{q} = 2 + \frac{p^2 - p - q^2}{q} 
$$ Case 2 and Case 3 Of course, here, $x_Q \leq 0$ so the origin is now part of P territory. This is where my work has come to an abrupt halt. I'm still having trouble making sense of the condition including $\sqrt{1+p^2}$. I know what it is geometrically, it's the length of the hypothenuse of the triangle S1 , origin and $(1,1)$, or more simply, it's the distance from S1 to $(1,1)$. My intuition tells that that wether $q$ is bigger or smaller than $\sqrt{1+p^2} -1$ will make $x_W$ be before/after the line $x=1$ ... but how? I've tried several inequalities to no avail. Where I need your help, simply: For now, I think it boils down to this... Is $x_W$ smaller or greater than 1 in cases 2 and 3? Recall the info above: Case 2: $0 \le \sqrt{1+p^2} - 1\le q \le p \le 1$ Case 3: $0 \le q \le \sqrt{1+p^2} -1  \le p \le 1$ $$
x_W = \frac{p}{q} \left( 1 + \frac{q^2 - p^2}{2p} \right)

Prove that $m(B) = 0$. As soon as I saw infinitely many, I thought I should write $B$ in a $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{k\geq n}B_k$ form. Then I hoped to prove that $\sum_iB_i <\infty$ which by using the first Borel-Cantelli lemma would give the result I wanted.

Also, now I think that writing set $B$ in such a form, would give me a set of the form $A-t$ with $t\in Z$ as a $B_i$. But then, that set has measure equal to the measure of $A$, and so the only way for $\sum_i B_i$ to converge, would be if $A$ had measure $0$, which is not an assumption (although it could be true, I don't know).

524970,"If the expectation $\langle v,Mv \rangle$ of an operator is $0$ for all $v$ is the operator $0$?",I ran into this a while back and convinced my self that it was true for all finite dimensional vector spaces with complex coefficients. My question is to what extent could I trust this result in the infinite dimensional case. If there is a circumstance where it is not true then I would like the corresponding counter example. The statement is $$\langle v| \textbf{M} v \rangle = 0 \quad \forall \mid v\rangle \in \mathbb{V} \Rightarrow \textbf{M}=0$$ $\textbf{M}$ is a linear operator on $\mathbb{V}$. $\mathbb{V}$ is a vector space over the field $\mathbb{C}$. In the case of finite dimensions we can see that this is true by going to the eigenbasis of $\textbf{M}$. In that case if $\textbf{M} \mid \lambda_i \rangle  = \lambda_i \mid \lambda_i \rangle $ then $\lambda_i \langle \lambda_i \mid \lambda_i \rangle= \langle \lambda_i \mid \textbf{M} \lambda_i \rangle = 0 \quad \forall i$. This means the diagonal form of $\textbf{M}$ is the zero matrix. This is assuming that the eigen vectors of $\textbf{M}$ can form a basis for the space which I believe is always true in finite dimensional vector spaces with complex coefficients because of the spectral theorem.

(given that $w$ lies in the closed upper half plane). What's wrong with my evaluation below of $F(\infty)$? I'm asking 1 because taking $w=bi$ with $b>1$, makes the expression $1-w^2$ negative, hence it's real part is zero. As for the evaluation of the integral, we have $$\int_0^\infty \frac{dw}{\sqrt{(1-w^2)(1-k^2w^2)}}=\int_0^1 \frac{dw}{\sqrt{(1-w^2)(1-k^2w^2)}}+\int_1^{1/k} \frac{dw}{\sqrt{(1-w^2)(1-k^2w^2)}}+\int_{1/k}^\infty \frac{dw}{\sqrt{(1-w^2)(1-k^2w^2)}}. $$ The middle integral in the RHS clearly equals $iK'$, and it will suffice to show that the other two cancel each other out.

(Suggestion: one possibility would be to consider $\sup S$, where $S = \{a < 1: \text{$f(x)$ is constant on $[0,a)$}\}$.) From what I understand, a function is locally constant if for any $a \in I$, $f(x) = k$ for $x \approx a$. Since it is constant, would this imply the supremum and the infimum equal on that interval? I would assume so. However, what do they mean by actually constant? I would assume this refers to each point, $a$, equaling the same point value, $k$. It seems clear this is true.

Then I consider $C=Y \times I$ and identify $C \times \{0\}$ with Y and $C\times \{1\}$ with $f(Y)$. I think that the fundamental group of the resulting space should have a presentation of the form
$$ \langle \pi_1(X),t | t g t^{-1} = f_*(g) \ \ \forall g\in \pi_1(Y)\rangle$$
(I omitted the relators which already appear in $\pi_1(X)$). This should follow from Seifert-van Kampen, but I can't see which are the open sets $U,V$ to which we are applying it (in the notations of the Wikipedia article ). Probably the generator $t$ arises as the curve we obtain as we follow some basepoint $y\in Y$ going through $C$ and back, so maybe $U$ should be some sort of ""tubular neighborhood$ of this curve; but I'm not sure how to formalize this (or even if this is true).","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'geometric-group-theory', 'group-theory']"

525169,Hilbert polynomial and Chern classes,"Motivation : moduli spaces of semistable sheaves. Let $(X,\mathcal O_X(1))$ be a smooth projective variety over a field $k=\overline k$.
When one defines the moduli functor $\mathcal M_P:\textrm{Sch}_k\to \textrm{Sets}$ of semistable sheaves, one fixes the Hilbert polynomial $P$; more precisely, I recall how the moduli functor is defined: an $S$-family $[\mathscr F]\in\mathcal M_P(S)$ is an equivalence class of a sheaf $\mathscr F\in\textrm{Coh}(X\times S)$ such that $\mathscr F_s$ is semistable on $X_s$, and has Hilbert polynomial $P$ for every closed point $s\in S$. Question : is fixing $P$ equivalent to fixing the Chern classes, and/or to fixing the Chern character? The Hilbert polynomial of a sheaf $E\in\textrm{Coh}(X)$ is $P(E,m)=\chi(X,E(m))=\int_X\textrm{ch}(E(m))\cdot\textrm{td}(X)$, and the Chern character is a polynomial in the Chern classes. Thus, given the Hilbert polynomial, one recovers the Chern classes. But do the Chern classes determine the Hilbert polynomial? In particular, I would like to know if the moduli problem of semistable sheaves stays unchanged if we replace ""Hilbert polynomial"" by ""Chern character"", or ""Chern classes"".

My question is, where does the $+ 1$ come from? I can see that if you wanted to ensure that all values are below a given percentile, it is useful. It also ensures the correct value for the median.

I have proved that for $T:U\rightarrow V$, with $dim(U)=m$ and $dim(V)=n$ that $rank(T)\le m$ which is obvious, but I have proved it none the less. I want to.... this is where I get stuck. I'm not quite sure how to say it. Suppose we have a $T$ for example that takes $U\subset\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow V\subset\mathbb{R}^3$, we could still have a $T$ that maps a plane to something (a plane, line or point) in this case rather than $rank(T)\le 3$ I can state $rank(T)\le 2$. (Correct my notation here, I don't like writing subset, I mean number of dimensions of the space!) To show this I can say $F:P\subset\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow U\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. Then let $G:P\rightarrow V$ and that $G=TF$, now $rank(G)\le dim(P) = 2$ Now, if $U,P,Q,R$ are spaces of dimension $\le 2$ and P,Q,R are subspaces of U $A:U\rightarrow P$ $B=A:P\rightarrow Q$ $C=A:Q\rightarrow R$ We can now say $A^2=BA$ then $A^3=CBA$ We know that for $A$ rank(A)$\le 2$, this thus provides an upper-bound for rank($A^3$) I want to show now that if I keep applying a linear transformation that the rank is a monotonically decreasing ($\le$) sequence. I am unsure on a proof that the rank of a transformation cannot be greater than the domain's dimensions. Although this is trivial. (NOTE: I have proven that if a set of n vectors, R, span a vector space V, and you take a set W of m linearly independent vectors in V that m$\le$n) If rank(A)=2 then rank($A^2$)=2 and so rank($A^3$)=2 if rank(A)=1 then rank($A^2$)=0 and rank($A^3$)=0 if rank(A)=0 then rank($A^2$)=0 and rank($A^3$)=0 But again, I can't prove this, or at least I am unsure of how to write it. something to clarify: For a map $T:U\rightarrow V$ how do we distinguish (using notation) whether or not we actually use all dim(U)? For example we might have a T that maps a plane in R^3 to a line in R^3, this can be expressed as a composition of maps, one that takes a 2 dimensional vector space (coordinates of the plane in 3 space) to a 3 dimensional point in T's domain, which T then maps to a line. We have rank - the dimensions of the image - to make this distinction on the map's target (the rank of T is 1 if it maps something to a line, but the dimensions of the target is 3) How do we write this? What do I say to describe this? How do I distinguish between the number of vectors in a basis and the number of dimensions the space that basis is in has? Sorry for the length of this!

For an (edit: smooth) algebraic curve $C/K$, why does $K(C)$ contain uniformizers for any point $P$ of $C$? My - so long - first and only idea was to take a minimum degree set of generators of the maximal ideal $M_P$ at $P$ and try find a contradiction if all of them were also contained in $M^2_P$. However, notation of degree in this situation is not entirely clear to me and apparently there are lots of things that can go wrong, so I have quite the feeling this is the wrong path. 2.) Why is the ramification index $e_\Phi(P) := ord_P(\Phi^{\ast} t_{\Phi}(P))$ for a uniformizer $ t_{\Phi}(P)$ at $P$ well defined and doesn't depend on the choice of the uniformizer?

If we consider a particle starting from $0$, it says that steps to the right are performed with probability $p$ and steps to the right are performed with probability $q = 1 - p$. The position of the particle after $n$ steps is determined by the number of steps to the right and to the left. It then introduces the following expression that it describes as an instrument that allows for finding the positions of the particle - $$pe^{i\theta} + qe^{-i\theta}$$ with the coefficients $p$ and $q$ being the probabilities that the first step was to the right and left respectively. If we square the expression $$(pe^{i\theta} + qe^{-i\theta})^2 = p^2 e^{2i\theta} + 2pq + q^2 e^{-2i\theta}$$ it says that the coefficient of the first term of the expansion gives the probability that the first two steps were to the right, the second term corresponds to the probability that the first two steps were made in opposite directions, and the coefficient of the third term gives the probability that the first two steps were to the left. Question I don't see the reasoning for the expression
$$pe^{i\theta} + qe^{-i\theta}$$ Where are they getting this complex analysis type expression from? Why are we dealing with $\theta$ when we are in a one dimensional space?

525914,Solving equations where the solution is an operator,"Ok, so here's some context. Solving regular equations we might have something like this: $2 + x = 5$, solving for $x$ we get 3. We might even have an equation like $x + y = 5$ where there are multiple solutions. But what's in common with all these equations is that the process, or the algorithm, we follow to solve them is determined by the operators that show the relations between variables. Now if you think back to very early elementary school, I'm sure you solved stuff like $5 \_ 2 = 3$ where you would fill in the blank with a minus. I'm wondering if there's a branch or mathematics that studies actual systematical ways to solve ""equations"" like that. It might seem trivial from this example but it obviously would grow in complexity. Perhaps the solutions would be operators AND numbers. The concrete problem I thought up that led me to this was trying to find a way to ""map"" any $\frac{1}{n}$ to $\frac{1}{n+1}$ by just adding/multiplying/something the first fraction by a constant. The ""equation"" would look something like this: $\frac{1}{n}\_C=\frac{1}{n+1}$ I can solve similar problems in my head, like: $n\_C=n+1$ where the obvious solution is $+$ and 1. Or for example, $n\_C=2n$ where the solution is $\times$ and 2. The last one can also have $+$ as a solution but then $C$ would have to be $n$ and would no longer be a constant.

A classic example would be: $$ \bigtriangledown = \left<\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right>$$ We can ""apply"" the operator in different ways, and I can see intuitively how it works - it appears that ""multiplying"" the operator by a ""thing"" is what ""applies"".

525968,Upperbound approximation to the sum of Euler's totient function,"I am currently working on a solution to a problem related to the density of finite coprime sets . I believe that I have found a solution to this problem - though it can only be expressed in terms of the sum of Euler's totient function: $$\Phi(N) = \sum_{i=1}^N \phi(i)$$ Although $\Phi(N)$ is well studied, many of the expressions for this term are not easy to work with from an analytical perspective (i.e. they depend on the Möbius function, or on recursive formulations....) I am wondering if anyone knows of a closed-form expression which provides an upper-bound approximation to $\Phi(N)$. The best one that I can come up with is somewhat obvious: $$S_N = \sum_{i=1}^N \phi(i) \leq \sum_{i=1}^N i = \frac{N(N+1)}{2} $$ A better version of this bound exploits the fact that $\phi(i) \leq \frac{i}{2}$, for even numbers (proposed by Hagen von Eitzen in the comments). This leads to: $$ \begin{align} S_N &= \sum_{i=1}^N \phi(i) \\

By $X$ and $Y$ being isomorphic we mean there are maps $f:X \rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y \rightarrow X$ preserving the group action. The main issue I'm having trouble with is that a $G$-set can be any kind of set, and one could in principle get quite creative with how a group $G$ acts on it. The orbit-stabilizer theorem narrows down the orders of such $G$-sets (they must divide the order of $G$), but one could still have a variety of different actions on sets of a given order. I've also proven the following for transitive $G$-sets $X, Y$: If $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is a morphism, then the stabilizer for any $x$ is a subgroup of the stabilizer for $f(x)$, and $|Y|$ divides $|X|$. The map $h: X \rightarrow \{ H \leq G\}$ given the rule $h(x) = Stab_G(x)$ is a morphism on $X$ with $G$ acting on its subgroups via conjugation. Its image is also a transitive $G$-set. This final fact seems to be the key, in that it might allow one to look solely at conjugates of subgroups of $G$ for all transitive $G$-sets up to isomorphism, but after playing around with it for hours I haven't been able to squeeze anything out of it. This is used in a problem set for a graduate course on group theory.

\frac{63976656349698612616236230953154487896987106}{63976656348486725806862358322168575784124416} \approx 1.00000000002
$$ Somehow that's impressive, but if take a look into the second example the things start to get more interesting: $$
1782^{12} + 1841^{12} \stackrel{?}{=} 1922^{12}
$$ $$
2541210258614589176288669958142428526657 \stackrel{?}{=} 2541210259314801410819278649643651567616
$$ As we can see the first 9 digits are exactly the same and the apsolute difference is: $700212234530608691501223040959$ . But if we take a relative difference or ratio we'll get: $$
\frac{2541210258614589176288669958142428526657}{2541210259314801410819278649643651567616} \approx 0.9999999997244572
$$ And this is pretty amazing, because if we make comparison using smaller number this is the same as comparing $10\, 000\, 000\, 000$ and $10\, 000\, 000\, 001$ Probably there are many more, probably infinite amount of such ""close"" examples, but are there any known examples? Is there any list of them? And as user17762 commented it would be nice to find a bound $\phi(n) = \inf\{\left| x^n + y^n - z^n\right| : x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ , although I would be more interested in finding the ratio bound, such that the ratio is closer to $1$ Also as user17762 pointed Taxicab can be used to provide a really close examples for $n=3$ , but what about other values for $n$ ?","['diophantine-approximation', 'elementary-number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"
526353,Let G be a group with exactly two nontrivial proper subgroups. Show that G is cyclic. What are the possible orders of G?,"Let G be a group with exactly two nontrivial proper subgroups. Show that G is cyclic.  What are the possible orders of G? Proof: Assume G has no nontrivial subgroups. Because G is trivial by the assumption above, then G is cyclic. If G has exactly one nontrivial subgroups H, consider the subgroup generated by a nonidentity element g in G/H Now suppose that H and K are the only nontrivial subgroups of G.
Recall that a group is never the union of two proper subgroups.... (Above is the start I have to my proof. I haven;t finished proving it is a cyclic group and can't figure out how to find what the possible orders may be.)",['group-theory']
526359,How to find the determinant of this matrix,"I have the following matrix: $
\begin{bmatrix}
 a & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & a & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & a & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & 1 & a \\
\end{bmatrix}
$ My approach is to rref the matrix so that i can find the determinant by multiplying along the diagonals. I attempted to do an rref and ended up with 
$
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 & a & 1 & 1 \\
 1-a & a-1 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 1-a & a-1 & 1 \\
 0 & 0 & 1-a & a-1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$ I then factored out (1-a) to get this
$
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 & a & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$
which will then make my determinant a multipile of $(1-a)^3$: 
$\det(A) = (1-a)^3x$ But now here I don't know what to do. I have a feeling that my approach is wrong. Any help or guide please?","['matrices', 'determinant']"
526367,What are non-orthogonal eigenvectors?,"Given a symmetric matrix $A$, the maximum of the trace, $Tr(Z^TAZ)$ under the assumption that $Z^TZ=I$ occurs when $Z$ has the eigenvectors of $A$, as $Tr(U^TAU)= \lambda_1 +\lambda_2+...\lambda_ d$ where $Z\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$. I know that the eigen vectors being the solution is as a result of the Courant minimax principle. q1) Now, I have faintly heard about non-orthogonal eigenvectors, and am very curious to know, why they are called so? Is this because they form a basis of the eigen-space of $A$ and are still non-orthogonal? What is its relation with the Courant Minimax / Courant Fischer characterization, if any? q2) How does it fit into the trace maximization formulation given above? Especially, if there is no other constraint, when the orthogonality is dropped, doesn't the problem become unbounded or ill-posed? if so, what are these non-orthogonal eigenvectors, optimizing? q3) If the matrix $A$ was not symmetric or non-normal, then what are its non-orthogonal eigenvectors solving for? or may be is this connected it to an SVD instead in this case? q4) When i Google, for applications of non-orthogonal eigenvectors, i just find nothing. What are its uses!?

526384,Is my answer correct? (And what's the name of the rule?)$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\left(n+3\right)!-n!}{n\left(n+2\right)!}$,"Want to know if I solved this problem correctly:
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\left(n+3\right)!-n!}{n\left(n+2\right)!} =\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1 \cdot 2 \ldots(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) - 1 \cdot 2 \ldots(n-1)n}{(1 \cdot 2 \ldots(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2))\cdot n}=\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{(1 \cdot 2 \ldots(n-1) n)\cdot((n+1)(n+2)(n+3)-1)}{(1 \cdot 2 \ldots(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2))\cdot n} =\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)-1}{(n+1)(n+2)\cdot n} = \frac{1}{1}=1$$ 
The answer is 1 because we've got $n^3$ in numerator and $n^3 $ in denominator, and the constants are both equals 1 so the limit can be calculated as $\frac{1}{1}$. (Sorry I don't remember that rule. Could you remain me please?)","['real-analysis', 'limits']"

526414,Derivative of the $\sin(x)$ when $x$ is measured in degrees,"So a classic thing to derive in calculus textbooks is something like a statement as follows Is $\frac{d}{dx}\sin(u)$ the same as the derivative of $\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x)$ where $u$ is an angle measured in degrees and $x$ is measured in radians? and of course the answer is no because of the chain rule. Except usually this is ambiguously worded as ""Is the derivative of $\sin(u)$, where $u$ is measured in degrees, equal to the derivative of $\sin(x)$ where $x$ is the same angle but measured in in radians?"" Then the texts go on to say something like ""No and this why we don't work in degrees and instead chose to work in radians, to avoid all the messy constants that come out of taking derivatives."" Am I crazy by thinking this is an odd thing to say that will end up confusing students. If your independent variable was an angle measured in degrees, you are probably more interested in it's derivative with respect to degrees not radians, which would infact be equal at the corresponding degrees and radians of an angle. Is my understanding wrong here. Is what the books say fine? I think at minimum they should at least be clear that we are taking the derivative with respect to radians, no? Note this is not a duplicate of Derivative of the sine function when the argument is measured in degrees Even though it is highly related.","['trigonometry', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
526441,Is this union of tangent spaces a known object in Algebraic Geometry?,"Let $C$ be a family of smooth (all but one curve is smooth, I'll explain later) cubic curves in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^2$ with the following property: given any two elements $a,b \in C$, the curves $a$ and $b$ intersect only at one point, namely $p$, with intersection multiplicity $9$. Because they only intersect once, every point in the projective plane other than $p$ lies on at most one cubic curve in $C$. Furthermore, we've shown that each point in the projective plane other than $p$ lies on exactly one cubic curve in $C$. Hence, we can assign to each point in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^2$, a tangent vector. Thus we can construct a vector field on the projective plane this way. Concerning the one non-smooth cubic curve: It has a nodal singularity at $p$. So when we construct the vector field, we can simply take the tangent vector that corresponds with all of the other cubic curves. I'm wondering if such a vector field that arises from a situation like this has a name, or whether it is even an interesting object to look at. Questions I'm wondering about: Which vector fields can be constructed in this way? Do all of the vector fields constructed in this way share certain properties? etc. I'm an undergraduate looking to write a senior thesis this year and this would be an extension of my REU project from the summer.","['plane-curves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves', 'vector-fields']"
526449,Fourier transform of a function of compact support,"My professor occasionally assigns optional difficult problems which we do not turn in from Stein and Shakarchi's Complex Analysis .

For $z \in \mathbb{C}$, let $\hat{f}(z)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-2\pi izt} dt$.  I am supposed to observe that $\hat{f}$ is an entire function, and using integration by parts show that for fixed $a\ge 0$ then $|y|\le a$ implies that for some constant $C_a$, $|\hat{f}(x+iy)|\le \frac{C_a}{1+x^2}$.  It says observe $\hat{f}$ is an entire function so I assume it is something simple but I don't see it.  Maybe I will have to evaluate the integral first. Which leads me to the integration by parts.  I am struggling with that without knowing the function f specifically.  I tried using $f$ as $u$ and the exponential function as $dv$ but got nowhere.  Thus, I am here asking for your help.
