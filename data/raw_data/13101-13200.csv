103105,Alternative way to prove that a group of order 160 is not simple,"Is there a neat way to show that a group of order 160 is not simple without directly quoting Poincare's theorem? I am thinking of maybe using the Sylow theorems to say that in order that the group is not simple we must have $n_2=5,\,\,\,n_5=2^4$ (due to the Sylow constraints). So then there are $2^4\times 4$ order 5 elements. But then I can't say that there are $5\times 2^5$ elements with not-equal-to-5 orders since these subgroups may intersect because they don't have prime orders. So what can we do next, or is this not even the right direction to start?","['sylow-theory', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

103177,Why does $\mathbb{C}$ have transcendence degree $\mathfrak{c}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$?,"It's pretty well known that $\text{trdeg}(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Q})=\mathfrak{c}=|\mathbb{C}|$. As a subset of $\mathbb{C}$, of course the degree cannot be any greater than $\mathfrak{c}$. I'm trying to understand the justification why it cannot be any smaller. The explanation in my book says that if $\mathbb{C}$ has an at most countable (i.e. finite or countable) transcendence basis $z_1,z_2,\dots$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, then $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}(z_1,z_2,\dots)$. Since a polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$ can be identified as a finite sequence of rationals, it follows that $|\mathbb{C}|=|\mathbb{Q}|$, a contradiction. I don't see why the polynomial part comes in? I'm know things like a countable unions/products of countable sets is countable, but could someone please explain in more detail this part about the polynomial approach? Since $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}(z_1,z_2,\dots)$, does that just mean that any complex number can be written as a polynomial in the $z_i$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$? For example,
$$
\alpha=q_1z_1^3z_4z_6^5+q_2z_{11}+q_3z^{12}_{19}+\cdots+q_nz_6z_8z^4_{51}?

103193,Complex vector spaces,"I was wondering if someone could please shed some light on how the following two vector spaces are different. The examples are from Paul Halmos's ""Finite Dimensional vector spaces"" book and the author asks the reader to verify that they are different, but i am not so sure if i understand the two examples well enough to spot all the differences. (1) Let $\mathbb C^1$ be the set of all complex numbers; if we interpret ""$x + y$"" and ""$ax$"" as ordinary complex numerical addition and multiplication, $\mathbb C^1$ becomes a complex vector space. (2) If, in the set $\mathbb C$ of all complex numbers, addition is defined as usual and multiplication of a complex number by a real number is defined as usual, then $\mathbb C$ becomes a real vector space. Is the difference between these two vector spaces examples only that in the first the scalar field is also the set $\mathbb C$ and in the second one the scalar field is $\mathbb R$ and hence only the multiplication and distributive properties would behave differently? What about dimensions of the two examples? Any Help would be highly appreciated. Cheers

measure on $X$ is a Borel measure on $X$ that is finite on all compact sets, outer regular on all Borel sets, and inner regular on open sets. From planetmath Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space. A Borel measure $\mu$ on $X$ is said to

103216,Remainder term of Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial,"Suppose  $x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are $n+1$ distinct numbers in the interval $[a,b]$ and $f\in C^{n+1}[a,b]$. Then for each $x$ in $[a,b]$, there is a number $\xi$ in $(a,b)$ such that $$f(x) = P(x) + \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)(x-x_1)\cdots(x-x_n)$$ where $P(x)$ is the Lagrange interpolating polynomial of degree at most $n$ with $f(x_k)=P(x_k)$. I am trying to understand geometrically why the remainder term $f(x)-P(x)$ should have the form given above. I am looking for a conceptual argument similar to the following for the lagrange form of the taylor remainder. Let
$$R(x) = g(x) - g(0) - g^{(1)}(0)x- \frac{g^{(2)}(0)}{2} x^2 - \cdots - \frac{g^{(k)}(0)}{k!}x^k$$
be the taylor remainder of $g(x)$. For a fixed $h>0$ let
$$p(x)= \frac{R(h)}{h^{k+1}}x^{k+1}$$
Then we have
$$R(0)=p(0), R^{(1)}(0)=p^{(1)}(0), \ldots, R^{(k)}(0)=p^{(k)}(0)$$ and $p(h) = R(h)$. In addition $p^{(k+1)}(x)$ is constant. If $R^{(k+1)}(x)$ were always strictly greater than the constant $p^{(k+1)}$ then since $R$ and $p$ agree on initial conditions at $x=0$ we would expect geometrically that $R$ to be greater than $p$ after $x=0$ contradicting $p(h) = R(h)$. Likewise if $R^{(k+1)}(x)$ were always strictly less than the $p^{(k+1)}$ we would expect $R$ to be less than $p$ after $x=0$ contradicting $p(h) = R(h)$. Thus we expect that $R^{(k+1)}(x)$ takes on values above and below $p^{(k+1)}$ and as well as $p^{(k+1)}$ itself. And this gives the lagrange form of the taylor remainder. Of course the standard formal argument would use the generalized form of Rolle's theorem, but I didn't need Rolle's theorem to see why the lagrange form of the taylor remainder should be right. There should be a similar ""geometric"" argument to motivate the error term for the lagrange interpolation polynomial.","['taylor-expansion', 'interpolation', 'calculus', 'polynomials']"

However, I'm not sure if this is useful, or how I can translate this to a statement about the length of $M_n$ .

So here are my questions: Is the statement true under certain hypothesis on $f$  (for example $f \in O(x)$ would be plausible), and in particular in the case of the $f(x) = \log(x)$? If not, how can I proceed in the initial proof, using Stirling, or otherwise? I do not know (and don't want to use) anything andvanced on the Stirling approximation, such as error estimates; I know that $n! = \sigma(n)(1+ O(\frac{1}{n}))$, and not much more.

103364,Sleeping Mathematician (Sleeping Beauty),"I came across the following thought experiment, and I would like to understand whether the controversy around it is justified. Imagine an experiment in which a mathematician is put to sleep with some kind of drug. He is located in a room that is designed in such a way as to keep him completely isolated from any kind of external information. The researchers have a sleep inducing drug that is able to put you to sleep and make you forget it was even administered. After the researchers have put the mathematician to sleep with this drug, they toss a fair coin. If it comes up heads they will wake the mathematician up once and administer the drug again. If it comes up tail they will wake him up twice, each time administering the drug again. Whenever the mathematician is awoken during the experiment, they will ask him for his best guess regarding the result of the coin toss. Eventually the experiment ends, and the researchers will awaken the mathematician a final time and tell him the experiment has ended. During the experiment, what answer should the mathematician give as his best guess for the result of the coin toss ? I think he should say that odds are the coin came up tail, but I am very curious what other people make of it, and whether there are any grounds for dissent at all.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'soft-question']"

By the first isomorphism theorem, I know that the order of the kernel must be 12. I know that $S_4$ has a subgroup of order 12, namely $A_4,$ the group of even permutations. I am tempted to say that it is the kernel. But the following concerns me: 1) How do I know that it is the subgroup of order 12 of $S_4$? How do I know there are no others? I know odd permutations do not form one, but is there a simpler/more elegant way to say it rather than going into ""consider a group with some even, some odd permutation cycles. Let's show it's not closed and thus can't be a subgroup of $S_4$?"" 2) A more general question, if a group has a subgroup, its order divides the group's order. But how many subgroups of such order can it maximally have (not talking about cyclic groups, who have unique subgroups for every order)? That is, let's say if I have a group of order 24, it could have 2 disjoint (besides the identity) subgroups of order 12 presumably, but could it have more? Obviously, with elements of both of the aforementioned disjoint (besides the identity) subgroups. What is the general theory behind this that could be used to answer the question (I feel like I either haven't studied it yet, or am missing something important). I know when we are dealing with cosets, everything gets broken down into equal-sized chunks, so if order of a subgroup is k and of group is x, you have exactly $\frac{x}{k}$ cosets.

For the first one, since $K$ is algebraic over $F$, then there is a surjection from $F[X]\to K$ mapping a polynomial $p(x)$ to one of its roots.

103432,Are there unique solutions for $n=\sum_\limits{j=1}^{g(k)} a_j^k$?,"Edward Waring, asks whether for every natural number $n$ there exists an associated positive
integer s such that every natural number is the sum of at most $s$ $k$ th powers of natural
numbers (for example, every number is the sum of at most 4 squares, or 9 cubes, or 19 fourth
powers, etc.) from here . I ask: Are there unique solutions for $n=\sum_\limits{j=1}^{g(k)} a_j^k$ , with $a_u\neq a_v \geq0 \; , \; \forall u\neq v$ ? $g(k)$ being the minimum number $s$ of $k$ th powers needed to represent all integers. $14$ would be an example of a unique decomposition (into $0^2+1^2+2^2+3^2$ ). Non-unique decompositions for $k=2$ can be constructed by letting $ n=(a_0+x)^2+\sum_\limits{j=1}^3 a_j^2$ and $a_0=x+\sum_\limits{j=1}^3 a_j$ . Robert gave a formula for cubes below . So another question is: How can one test that a certain $n$ has a unique solution, or even better how can I calculate the number of respresentations? As Gerry points out in his comment , a prime $p=4k+1\;$ has a unique representation $p=a^2+b^2$ with $0<a<b\;$ ( Thue's Lemma ). Partial answer for $k=2$ (from here ) The sequence of positive integers whose representation as a sum of four squares is unique is: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 23, 24, 32, 56, 96, 128, 224... (sequence A006431 in OEIS). These integers consist of the seven odd numbers $1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 23$ and all numbers of the form $2 × 4^k, 6 × 4^k$ or $14 × 4^k$ . Partial , therefore, because $23=1^2+2^2+2\times 3^2$ ( answer , because $14\times 4^k$ is unique). Another way to look at it, uses ${g(k)}$ -dimensional vector spaces $V$ over $\mathbb N_0^+$ that are provided with an $k$ -norm $||a||_k=\left( \sum_\limits{j=1}^{g(k)} a_j^k \right)^{1/k}$ and the additional conditions that $a_u\neq a_v \geq0 \; , \; \forall u\neq v$ .
Now there is a set of length-preserving operations $U_p$ , that transforms vectors, from a defined range $\mathcal R (U_p)$ . An example operation was shown above.
In this framework the question sounds like: Which vectors of $V$ lie outside the union of all $\mathcal R (U_p)$ ?","['summation', 'elementary-number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"

A short edge is an edge with form $\{i,i+1\}$. The recurrence was
$$
G_n(x)=(x+2n-2)G_{n-1}(x)+(1-x)\frac{d}{dx}G_{n-1}(x).
$$ Why does it hold? I rearranged this as
$$
G_n(x)=xG_{n-1}(x)+(2n-2)G_{n-1}(x)+\frac{d}{dx}G_{n-1}(x)-x\frac{d}{dx}G_{n-1}(x).

Looking at the individual coefficients of the summands, I see that: The coefficient of $x^s$ in $G_n(x)$ is the number of perfect matchings on $[2n]$ with $s$ short edges. The coefficient of $x^s$ in $xG_{n-1}(x)$ is the number of perfect matchings on $[2n-2]$ with $s-1$ short edges. The coefficient of $x^s$ in $(2n-2)G_{n-1}(x)$ is $2n-2$ times the number of perfect matchings on $[2n-2]$ with $s$ short edges. The coefficient of $x^s$ in $\frac{d}{dx}G_{n-1}(x)$ is $s+1$ times the number of perfect matchings on $[2n-2]$ with $s+1$ short edges. The coefficient of $x^s$ in $x\frac{d}{dx}G_{n-1}(x)$ is $s$ times the number of perfect matchings on $[2n-2]$ with $s$ short edges. Denoting these quantities as $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$, respectively, it should be that $A=B+C+D-E$. Is there some clever way to show that the four possibilities in the RHS count all possibilities?

Now, if I think about this, I can understand the justification for calling this a torus, but I'm trying to understand how one would go about actually proving this. Indeed, there exist analytical descriptions of the torus such as this one provided by Wikipedia. So one could theoretically, with enough inspiration, find a homemorphism $h: S^1 \times S^1 \rightarrow G(T)$ where $G(T)$ denotes the graph of the torus as realized by the analytical description. This approach, assuming it works, uses coordinates and in any event wouldn't be very enlightening. So, my question is, is there a coordinate-free way to prove that $S^1 \times S^1$ is homeomorphic to this thing we call a doughnut?

Prove $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{2^n}{n!} = 0$. For $n > 2$, we have: $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{2^n}{n!} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{2^2}{2!}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{4}\times\frac{2}{5}\times\cdots\times\frac{2}{n}$. Need to show that $\frac{2^2}{2!}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{4}\times\frac{2}{5}\times\cdots \to 0$. In other words, need to show that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{2}{n} = 0$: $\forall\epsilon\in\mathbb{N}^+, \exists N\in\mathbb{N} $ such that $\forall n>N$ we have $\frac{2}{n} < \epsilon$. Take $N = \frac{2}{\epsilon}$. Since $n>N$ we have $n > \frac{2}{\epsilon}$. Thus $\frac{2}{n} < \epsilon$. Therefore  $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{2}{n} = 0$. And so $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{2^2}{2!}\times\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{4}\times\frac{2}{5}\times...\times\frac{2}{n} = 0$.

103633,"In a graph, connectedness in graph sense and in topological sense","From Wikipedia Graphs have path connected subsets, namely those subsets for which
  every pair of points has a path of edges joining them. But it is not
  always possible to find a topology on the set of points which induces
  the same connected sets. The 5-cycle graph (and any n-cycle with n>3
  odd) is one such example. As a consequence, a notion of connectedness can be formulated
  independently of the topology on a space. To wit, there is a category
  of connective spaces consisting of sets with collections of connected
  subsets satisfying connectivity axioms; their morphisms are those
  functions which map connected sets to connected sets (Muscat &
  Buhagiar 2006). Topological spaces and graphs are special cases of
  connective spaces; indeed, the finite connective spaces are precisely
  the finite graphs. However, every graph can be canonically made into a topological space,
  by treating vertices as points and edges as copies of the unit
  interval (see topological graph theory#Graphs as topological spaces).
  Then one can show that the graph is connected (in the graph
  theoretical sense) if and only if it is connected as a topological
  space. I was wondering if the two bold sentences contradict each other? Thanks and regards!","['general-topology', 'graph-theory']"
103643,Galois group of $X^4 + 4X^2 + 2$ over $\mathbb Q$.,"I'd like to calculate the Galois group of the polynomial $f = X^4 + 4X^2 + 2$ over $\mathbb Q$. My thoughts so far: By Eisenstein, $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb Q$. So $\mathrm{Gal}(f)$ must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, i.e. $\mathrm{Gal}(f) = S_4, \ A_4, \ D_8, \ V_4$ or $C_4$. $X^4 + 4X^2 + 2 = 0 \Leftrightarrow X^2 = -2 \pm \sqrt{2}$. Write $\alpha_1 = \sqrt{-2 + \sqrt{2}}, \ \alpha_2 = -\sqrt{-2+\sqrt{2}}, \ \alpha_3 = \sqrt{-2-\sqrt{2}}, \ \alpha_4 = - \sqrt{-2-\sqrt{2}}$ for the roots of $f$. Then $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2}, \alpha_1, \alpha_2) = \mathbb Q(\sqrt{2}, \alpha_1) $ is a degree $2$ extension of $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2})$, and likewise for $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2}, \alpha_3, \alpha_4) = \mathbb Q(\sqrt{2}, \alpha_3)$. So, by the tower law, the splitting field of $f$ is at most a degree $8$ extension of $\mathbb Q$, so $\mathrm{Gal}(f) = D_8, \ V_4$ or $C_4$. If I could show that $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2}, \alpha_1) \neq \mathbb Q(\sqrt{2}, \alpha_3)$, then I'd have that $\mathrm{Gal}(f) = D_8$. At a glance this looks to be true, but I don't know how to prove it. $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb Q (\sqrt{2}) / \mathbb Q) = C_2 \lhd D_8, \ V_4$ and $C_4$, so this doesn't rule anything out.

103700,Proof that there are infinitely many Ulam numbers,"This is part of self-study; this question is taken from ""Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications"" (Rosen). We define the Ulam numbers by setting $u_1$ = 1 and $u_2$ = 2. Furthermore, after determining whether the integers less than n are Ulam numbers, we set n equal to the next Ulam number if it can be written uniquely as the sum of two different Ulam numbers. Note that $u_3$ = 3, $u_4$ = 4, $u_5$ = 6, and $u_6$ = 8. Prove that there are infinitely many Ulam numbers. I encountered a proof for this, but I'm not sure why it is valid. Assume that there are only finitely many Ulam numbers. Let the two largest Ulam numbers be $u_{n-1}$ and $u_n$. Then the integer $u_{n-1}$ + $u_n$ is an Ulam number larger than $u_n$. It is the unique sum of two Ulam numbers, since it is the largest sum between two of the n Ulam numbers. The idea of this proof is that, if there are n Ulam numbers, for example, there is always $u_{n+1}$. To show this, I have to show somehow that there will always be two numbers among these n numbers whose sum is unique and greater than $u_n$. While trying to understand this proof, I found that there seems to be something wrong, because it is not always true that, for n Ulam numbers, $u_{n-1} + u_n$ will be an Ulam number. For example, consider the n Ulam numbers with n = 3: 1, 2, 3. The sum 3 + 2 = 5 is not an Ulam number, because 4 is an Ulam number and 4 + 1 = 5, and the sum has to be unique. In fact, the idea used in this proof is similar to Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many primes. Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many primes (taken from http://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/euclids.html ): ""Call the primes in our finite list $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_r$.  Let P be any common multiple of these primes plus one (for example, P = $p_1p_2...p_r+1$).  Now P is either prime or it is not.  If it is prime, then P is a prime that was not in our list.  If P is not prime, then it is divisible by some prime, call it p.  Notice p can not be any of $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_r$, otherwise p would divide 1, which is impossible.  So this prime p is some prime that was not in our original list.  Either way, the original list was incomplete."" There is a great similarity between these proofs: both create a new number from the original list of n numbers. The problem is that, in Euclid's proof, there is the fact any integer greater than 1 must be a product of primes (or powers of primes) . Then, the sum of all primes in the list plus 1 must be a product of primes. So, there is no need that the newly created number must be a prime, because, if it is not a prime, it can be assured that it must have in its composition prime numbers that are not in the original list. This assures that there is some non-specified prime greater than the ones on the list. In the case of Ulam numbers, if $u_n + u_{n-1}$ is not a Ulam number, how can I assure that there is still an Ulam number that is greater than $u_n$?","['elementary-number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
103708,"Partitions of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ with no consecutive integers in each block is counted by $B(n-1)$?","I'm trying to understand why $B(n-1)$ also counts the number of partitions of $[n]$ where not two consecutive integers appear in the same block.

103845,Help to finish my proof: inequality with norm and Schwarz ineq,"Let $A=\left [ a_{ij} \right ]$ be the matrix of a linear mapping $A\in L\left ( \mathbb{R}^{n},\mathbb{R}^{m} \right )$. -Prove that: $\left \| A \right \|\leq \left ( \sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}a{_{ij}}^{2} \right )^{^{\frac{1}{2}}}$ Note that: $\left \| A \right \|=sup_{\left \| x \right \|=1} \left \| Ax \right \|$ My tentative: $A$ is an $m*n$ matrix. Let $A_{i}$ be the $i$th row of $A$. Then the $ith$ row of the vector $Ax$ is the dot product $\left \langle A_{i},x \right \rangle$. Then: $\left \| Ax \right \|=\sqrt{\left \langle  A_{1},x\right \rangle^{2}+\left \langle A_{2},x \right \rangle^{2}+...+\left \langle A_{m},x \right \rangle^{2}}$ and using Schwarz inequality:$\left | \left \langle A_{i},x \right \rangle  \right |< \left \| A_{i} \right \|.\left \| x \right \|$ we get that the left hand side is less than or equal to $\sqrt{\left ( \left \| A_{1} \right \|^{2}+...+\left \| A_{n} \right \|^{2} \right ).\left \| x \right \|^{2}}=\sqrt{\left ( \left \| A_{1} \right \|^{2}+...+\left \| A_{n} \right \|^{2} \right )}$ because $\left \| x \right \|=1$ Is there anything wrong with my proof? Please let me know if there are any details I should add to the proof to finish it off. Also, if you guys have any alternative proofs, please share.

103853,how to calculate $\frac{d\dot{x}}{dx}$,Let $x$ depend on $t$. $\dot{x}$ is derivative $x$ over $t$. I want to know if  there are formulas to simplify $\frac{d\dot{x}}{dx}$? Any hint or thought is appreciated. Thank you!,['derivatives']
103855,Dense subset of a Hilbert space,"Let $A$ be a dense subspace of a Hilbert space $H$. 
Denote $\ell^2$ the Hilbert space of (complex valued) square-summable sequences
and denote $\ell^2(H)$ the Hilbert space of $H$-valued (norm)square-summable sequences. Questions: 1) Do we have that $\ell^2(A)$ is a dense subspace of $\ell^2(H)$ ?  (Here $\ell^2(A)$ is the natural subspace 
of $\ell^2(H)$ with $A$-valued sequences). 2) Do we have $\ell^2(A) \simeq \ell^2\otimes A$  (here $\otimes$ is the (algebraic) vector space tensor product). Does this (possible) isomorphism extends to the prehilbertian structures ? 3) Do we have $\ell^2(H) = \ell^2\widehat{\otimes} H$ (as tensor product of Hilbert space) ? 4) Do we have $\ell^2\otimes A$  dense in $\ell^2\widehat{\otimes} H$ ?","['hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
103858,Is $2^\infty$ uncountable and is cardinality a continuous function?,"I apologize if the title seems too vague, but this is how I was asked the question. So one of my friends intended to write an infinite sum like $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_{2^i}$ . However, he wrote $\displaystyle \sum_{i=2^0}^{2^\infty} a_{i}$. Then he was worried whether $2^\infty$ was uncountable [since we had proved $|2^{\mathbb{N}}| = c$ in class and $2^X$ stands for the power set of $X$] and the sum did not make sense since he believed he is adding uncountable number of elements. I resolved his difficulties by explaining that $2^n \to n$ is an injection and thus the set of powers of two can have a cardinality of at most that of naturals and thus the set is countable. He was not very convinced :( Is there a more convincing argument? I guess he was blinded by some sort of a notion that cardinality is a continuous function of sets. To make it precise, lets define: ${\cal F}_n := 2^{\{1,2,3,\cdots, n\}} $. $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of naturals. We note that ${\cal F}_n \subset {\cal F}_{n+1}$ and $\displaystyle \bigcup_{n \geq 1} {\cal F}_n = 2^{\mathbb{N}}$ ( Edit : $\displaystyle \bigcup_{n \geq 1} {\cal F}_n = 2^{\mathbb{N}}$ is wrong , see comments below). Now $|{\cal F}_n| = 2^n$ and thus we must have ${\cal F}_n \to 2^{\mathbb{N}}$ and thus $|{\cal F}_n| \to c$. So I believe cardinality is not a continuous function, but then one needs a natural topology on the cardinals to say such a thing. So my question is: Do we have a natural topology on the cardinals where one can show cardinality is not a continuous function of sets?

103859,How to prove $f(x)>g(x)$ by showing $f'(x)>g'(x)$ for some $x>x_0$,"Is it possible to show that some function $f(x)$ is larger than $g(x)$ if I can show that its derivative is larger for some $x>x_0$? As an example I can think of $f(x)=(1+x)^n , \ g(x)=1+nx+ \frac{n(n-1)x^2}{2}$, which derivatives are $n(1+x)^{n-1}$ and $n+n(n-1)x$ and the use Bernoulli inequality to show that $f'(x)>g'(x)$ for $x>0$.","['inequality', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
103864,"Conditions for an ""Algebra"" of probabilities","Suppose I have events $A,B,C,D,\ldots$ and that my probability space is discrete and finite (As nice as possible). Now, suppose I give you the values of say $P(A,B)$ , $P(A|B,C)$, $P(D, B|A)$ etc etc. When can I determine whether or not I have enough information to calculate a quantity like $P(C, D | A, B)$. In other words, I give you a bunch of single, joint and conditional probabilities. Which functions of the form $f(x1,x2,\ldots, x1',x2',\ldots):= P(x1, x2, \ldots | x1', x2',\ldots)$ are calculable? Notice that by basic conditioning rules I can reduce most statements to sums and ratios of probabilities of unions or intersections. I don't expect there to be a ""closed form"" answer to any of this but, is there at least some general overview?","['statistics', 'probability', 'probability-theory']"
