907743,"The topology a line inherits as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$, or of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ (Munkres)","Exercise 8, Chapter 2, Section 16, Page 92, from the Munkres's book: The topology $\mathbb{R}_l$ is the topology on $\mathbb{R}$ generated by all half-open intervals of the form \begin{align*}
[a, b) = \{ x \, |\, a \le x < b \},
\end{align*} where $a < b$ . By Lemma 13.4 from the Munkres's textbook, this topology is finer than the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ . Thus, all open sets of the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ also belong to the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ . By Theorem 15.1 from the Munkres's textbook, a basis for the product topology $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ is the collection of all the products $[a, b) \times (c, d)$ , where $[a, b)$ is a half-open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ , and $(c, d)$ is an open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ . The products $[a, b) \times (c, d)$ represent the interior of rectangles, where the rectangles have sides parallel to the coordinate axes, along with the left side of the rectangle. The corners do not belong to the open set. To avoid difficulty with notation, we shall denote the general element of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ by $x \times y$ . Let $L$ be a straight line in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ ; then, $L$ is a subset of points of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ . The topology $L$ inherits as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ , has as basis all sets of the form $[a, b) \times (c, d) \cap L$ ; it is easy to see that the intersection is a line segment of $L$ . We have three possible cases: (1) The straight line $L$ is parallel to $x$ -axis. Therefore, $L$ intersects the left side of the rectangles, and then the points of the line segment belong to a half-open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $[\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . We deduce that the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ is the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ . (2) The straight line $L$ is parallel to $y$ -axis. Therefore, $L$ intersects the upper and lower sides of the rectangles, and then the points of the line segment belong to an open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $(\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . Therefore, the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ is the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ . (3) The straight line $L$ is not parallel to any of the axes. Therefore, if $L$ intersects the left side of the rectangles, the points of the line segment belong to a half-open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $[\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . But if $L$ does not intersect the left side of the rectangles, the points of the line segment belong to an open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $(\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . The collection of half-open intervals $[\alpha, \beta)$ is a basis for the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ , and the open intervals $(\alpha, \beta)$ are open sets in $\mathbb{R}_l$ . It follows that the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}$ is the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ . Now, let us consider the topology $L$ inherits as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ . By Theorem 15.1 from the Munkres's textbook, a basis for the product topology $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ is the collection of all the products $[a, b) \times [c, d)$ , where $[a, b)$ is a half-open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ , and $[c, d)$ is a half-open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ . The products $[a, b) \times [c, d)$ represent the interior of rectangles, where the rectangles have sides parallel to the coordinate axes, along with their left and lower sides. Note that the lower left corner of the rectangle belongs to the product $[a, b) \times [c, d)$ as well. Let $L$ be a straight line in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ . The topology $L$ inherits as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ , has as basis all sets of the form $[a, b) \times [c, d) \cap L$ . We have also three possible cases: (1) The straight line $L$ is parallel to $x$ -axis, or is parallel to $y$ -axis. In the first case, $L$ intersects the left side of the rectangles, and in the second case, $L$ intersects the lower side of the rectangles. In both cases, the points of the line segment belong to a half-open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $[\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . We deduce that the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ is the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ . (2) The straight line $L$ is not parallel to any of the axes, and makes an angle less than $\pi / 2$ with the $x$ -axis. Therefore, $L$ intersects the left side, the lower side, or the lower left corner of the rectangles, and then, the points of the line segment belong to a half-open interval of $L$ , which can be denoted as $[\alpha, \beta)$ , where $\alpha,\beta \in L$ . Again, the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ is the topology of $\mathbb{R}_l$ . (3) The straight line $L$ is not parallel to any of the axes, and makes an angle greater than $\pi / 2$ with the $x$ -axis. Therefore, $L$ may intersect any sides of the rectangles, or may only intersect the lower left corner of the rectangle. Then, if the intersection is a line segment of the straight line $L$ , the points belong to an interval open, half-open or closed of $L$ ; if the intersection is a point of $L$ , we have a one-point open set (singleton set). Then, the topology $L$ inherits as subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ is the discret topology on $\mathbb{R}$ .","['general-topology', 'product-space']"
907797,How many subspace topologies of $\mathbb{R}$?,"Say two subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are equivalent if they are homeomorphic, with the subspace topology.  How many equivalence classes are there? It's immediate that there are at least $\beth_0$ (we can get any finite discrete topology) and no more than $\beth_2 = \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$. I have a semi-complex construction below to show there are at least $\beth_1$. Without the generalized continuum hypothesis, this question seems harder and possibly independent.  I would be interested in an answer which assumes the continuum hypothesis, and thus answers either $\beth_1$ or $\beth_2$. Let's not complicated things too much, but we could also ask this question on $S^1$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$: on $S^1$ the construction below does not work, and on $\mathbb{R}^2$ it's much easier. Construction of $\beth_1$ non-homeomorphic subsets: The idea is that being a limit point, or being a limit point of limit points, or being a limit point of limit points of limit points... are topological properties.  For a given set $A \subset \mathbb{R}$, call a point A $P_0$ point if it is in $A$. A $P_n$ point if it is the limit point of $P_{n-1}$ points. A $Q_n$ point if it is a $P_n$ point, but not a $P_{n+1}$ point. A $R_n$ point if it is a $Q_n$ point and each neighborhood of the point (in A) is uncountable. The existence of a $R_n$ point is a topological invariant.  I claim that for any $J \subset \mathbb{N}$, it's possible to create $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ which has a $R_n$ point if and only if $n \in J$. To motivate the construction and the definition of $Q_n$, first think about constructing a $P_n$ point.  For example, the set $\{0\} \cup \{ 1/k : k \in \mathbb{N} \}$ has $0$ as a $P_1$ point.  Now, add some points to that set: on each interval $(1/(k+1), 1/k)$, add a sequence of points limiting to $1/(k+1)$.  Then The points we just added are $P_0$ points. For each $k$, the point $1/k$ is a $P_1$ point and a $P_0$ point, and thus a $Q_1$ point but not a $Q_0$ point. 0 is a $P_2$ point, a $P_1$ point, and a $P_0$ point.  Therefore it is a $Q_2$ point. Now, it would be simpler if we didn't need the $R_n$ definition.  But as you see, we can't make a $Q_n$ point without also making a $Q_{n-1}$ point.  Now consider adding the interval $(-1, 0)$ to the set we've constructed so far.  The $0$ would be a $R_2$ point, but there would be no $R_1$ or $R_0$ points. To construct a set corresponding to $J \subset \mathbb{N}$, do similar constructions as above all around $\mathbb{R}$, for each $n \in J$.","['general-topology', 'set-theory', 'descriptive-set-theory']"
907829,Completely stumped on exercise cooncerning the characterisation of Jordan measure - would anyone be willing to give a hint?,"In Terry Tao's notes on measure theory he has the following exercise, I have no idea how to deal with the last statement, I would really appreciate it if someone could give a hint for the final case. Show that the following are equivalent: $E$ is Jordan Measurable For all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists elementary sets $A$ and $B$ satisfying $A \subset E \subset B$ such that $m(B/A) \leq \epsilon$ For all $\epsilon >0$ there exists an elementary set $A$ such that $m^{*}(A\Delta E) \leq \epsilon,$ where $m^*(\cdot)$ is the Jordan outer measure. Here is my attempt so far: $1. \Rightarrow 2.$ Since $E$ is measureable, we have $m(E) = m^*(E) = m_*(E)$ where $m_*(\cdot)$ is the Jordan inner measure. By assumption we can find elementary sets $B$ and $A$ where  $A \subset E \subset B$ such that $m(B) - m(E) \leq \epsilon$ and $m(E) - m(A) \leq \epsilon.$ It thus follows that $m(B) - m(A) \leq 2\epsilon.$ Since $A$ and $B$ are elementary we have that $m(B) = m(B/A) + m(A).$ combined with the inequality above this gives $m(B/A) \leq 2\epsilon$ $2. \Rightarrow 1.$ Choose $A \subset E \subset B$ with $m(B/A) \leq \epsilon$ then $\epsilon \geq m(B/A) = m(B) - m(A) \geq m(B) - m_*(E) \geq m^*(E) - m_*(E) = |m^*(E) - m_*(E)|$ Since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary the result follows.",['measure-theory']

907885,What is the topology generated by a basis?,"Reading Munkres' text on Topology, we get the fairly straight-forward definition of a basis: $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for a topology on $X$ if $\mathcal{B}$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that (1) For each $x\in X$ , there is at least one basis element $B$ containing $X$ . (2) If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$ , then there us a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 \subset B_1 \cap B_2$ . Now, Munkres proceeds to (roughly) define the topology $\tau$ generated by $\mathcal{B}$ contains elements $U$ so that for each $x \in U$ there is a basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B$ and $B \subset U$ . Consider the set $X = \{a,b,c\}$ . Then, by definition, $\mathcal{B} = \{\{a\},\{b\},\{c\}\}$ is a basis for a topology on $X$ . We proceed to (attempt to) find the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$ . Clearly, $\{a\},\{b\},\{c\} \in \tau$ . We note that given our definitions, the topology $\tau$ generated by $\mathcal{B}$ is $\{X, \emptyset, \{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{a,c\},\{b,c\}\}$ . Is this correct, or have I misunderstood something? In particular, does this mean that we may have bases of different cardinalities?",['general-topology']
907935,When is an operator on $\ell_1$ the dual of an operator on $c_0$?,"Suppose $T:\ell_1\to\ell_1$ is a continuous linear operator.  When can we say that $T$ is a dual, or adjoint, of an operator on $c_0$?  In other words, under what conditions can we find a continuous linear $S:c_0\to c_0$ such that $T=S^*$? Recall that $c_0$ is a subspace of $\ell_\infty=\ell_1^*$, and so we can talk about the restriction $T^*|_{c_0}$ of $T^*:\ell_\infty\to\ell_\infty$ to $c_0$. Observation. If $T^*c_0\subseteq c_0$ then $T=S^*$ for some continuous linear $S:c_0\to c_0$. Proof. Notice that $(T^*|_{c_0})^*$ is a continuous linear operator acting on $\ell_1$.  We claim $T=(T^*|_{c_0})^*$.  If not, then there is $z^*\in\ell_1$ so that $Tz^*\neq(T^*|_{c_0})^*z^*$.  Hence, there is $y^{**}\in c_0\subset\ell_\infty$ such that $(Tz^*)(y^{**})\neq((T^*|_{c_0})^*z^*)(y^{**})$. However, \begin{equation*}((T^*|_{c_0})^*z^*)(y^{**})=z^*(T^*y^{**})=(T^*y^{**})(z^*)=y^{**}(Tz^*)=(Tz^*)(y^{**}),\end{equation*} a contradiction.  $\square$ So, using the above, we could look for conditions to guarantee that $T^*c_0\subseteq c_0$.  Perhaps it might help to try to adapt the above proof to work for certain kinds of transformations, say $U,V:\ell_\infty\to\ell_\infty$ with $VT^*Uc_0\subseteq c_0$. Or, we could try an entirely different approach.  Suggestions are welcome! P.S. It would be fantastic if it turned out that if $T$ fails to be strictly singular (or have countable spectrum) then $T=S^*$ for some $S$.  However, that seems too much to hope for.","['operator-theory', 'sequences-and-series', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

Where $Reas$ can be for example the set of real analytic functions $C^\omega (\mathbb{R})$.

So, is there a class of functions $SloFall\subset C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ for which $$\forall f(x) \in SloFall: {\rm lim}_{x \to \infty} f(x) = 0 \land {\rm lim}_{x \to \infty} |x f(x)| = \infty \,? $$ Could you give some examples of such functions?

I am having trouble proving this. What I have done so far . Since $\phi_t$ is the flow of the DE then $\dot{\phi_t}=-ax+\xi(x)$. Also $\phi_0(x)=x$ by properties of flow. Since $(0,0)$ is a rest point of the given differential equation and the linearization of the system about $(0,0)$ is $\dot x=-ax$ it follows that the rest point $(0,0)$ is asymptotically stable.

Then $L(C)$ is compact in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Proof: Since $H$ is a Banach space, and $C$ is closed and convex, $C$ is weakly closed (Mazur's Theorem in Lang's Real Analysis ).  Since $H$ is a reflexive Banach space, closed balls are weakly compact  (Kakutani's Theorem).  Since $C$ is bounded it is contained in a weakly compact ball, and since $C$ is weakly closed, $C$ is weakly compact. Since $L$ is continuous in the strong topologies, it is continuous in the weak topologies (this fact seems to be well known).  So $L(C)$ is weakly compact in  $\mathbb{R}^n$,
and since the weak and strong topologies on  $\mathbb{R}^n$ are the same,  $L(C)$ is compact in  $\mathbb{R}^n$.  $\square$ Convexity is essential. Otherwise I have a counterexample. This is not a homework problem.  The motivation comes from the physics of color. In my case $H$ is $L^2([380,780])$ where 380 and 780 are wavelengths of light in nanometers.  $C$ is the subset of functions that take values in $[0,1]$ and each such function represents the spectral reflectance (or spectral transmittance) of a material over this interval of wavelengths.   $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the 3D space of CIEXYZ tristimulus coordinates.  $L$ is the linear mapping from the reflectance of the material to CIEXYZ, for a fixed spectral illuminant.  $L(C)$ is the set of all possible material colors for the given illuminant.

908132,When does $V/\operatorname{ker}(\phi)\simeq\phi(V)$ imply $V\simeq\operatorname{ker}(\phi)\oplus\phi(V)$?,"When does $V/\operatorname{ker}(\phi)\simeq\phi(V)$ imply $V\simeq\operatorname{ker}(\phi)\oplus\phi(V)$? I wrote it down in an imprecise way on purpose. The notation above is the linear algebra one: we have $V,W$ vector spaces over a field $\mathbb K$ and a $\mathbb K$-linear map $\phi:V\to W$. Then we know that isomorphism theorem says that
$$
V/\operatorname{ker}(\phi)\simeq\phi(V)
$$
and we also know that $\operatorname{dim_{\mathbb K}}V=
\operatorname{dim_{\mathbb K}}(\operatorname{ker}(\phi))+
\operatorname{dim_{\mathbb K}}(\phi(V))$. But when do we have that from this it follows that
$$
V\simeq\operatorname{ker}(\phi)\oplus\phi(V)\;\;?
$$ This was to be more precise on the particular case of the vector space, but it would be nice to know how it goes in every situation in which the isomorphism theorem works (rings homomorphism, groups homomorphism and so on). EDIT: This question came to my mind originally because I was studying the group of units in a number ring $R$ (i.e. $R=\mathbb A\cap K$, where $\mathbb Q\le K\le\mathbb C$, $[K:\mathbb Q]=n$ and $\mathbb A$ is the ring of algebraic integers of $\mathbb C$). There is a theorem which states that in this case the group of units $U$ is a direct product of a finite cyclic group formed by the roots of $1$, call it $V$ and a free abelian group of finite rank $W$ (the rank is $r+s-1$ where $r$ is the number of real embeddings of $K$ and $2s$ is the number of complex embedding of $K$; and clearly $n=r+2s$). In order to show this, we build a moltiplicative-to-additive group homomorphism $U\to\mathbb R^{r+s}$ called $\log$ (it's a special logarithm), whose kernel is exactly $V$ and whose image is $W\simeq\mathbb Z^{r+s-1}$. From this, my book (Daniel Marcus' Number Fields) let follow that $U\simeq V\times W$, and even though it sounds good, I didn't understand exactly why. SECOND EDIT: if it could help I'll write better the map $\log$.
Consider the $r$ real embeddings of $K$: $\sigma_i$, and the $2s$ complex ones $\tau_j, \bar{\tau_j}$. We can define an additive groups monomorphism
$$
\varphi:K\to\mathbb R^n
$$
defined by
$$
\varphi(x)=(\sigma_1(x),\dots,\sigma_r(x),\Re(\tau_1(x)),\Im(\tau_1(x)),\dots,\Re(\tau_s(x)),\Im(\tau_s(x)))\;\;.
$$
Then given an integral basis of $R$, say $\{\alpha_i\}_{i=1}^n$ we can consider the $\varphi(\alpha_i)$'s: they form a basis for $\mathbb R^n$, hence we can consider the $n$-dimensional lattice generated by them: $$
\Lambda_{R}:=\operatorname{Span}(\varphi(\alpha_1),\dots,\varphi(\alpha_n{})):=\langle\varphi(\alpha_1),\dots,\varphi(\alpha_n{})\rangle_{\mathbb Z}\;.
$$
It's clear that $\varphi$ sends $R$ onto $\Lambda_R$ hence they are isomorphic. Then consider
$$
U\subset R\setminus\{0\}\stackrel{\varphi}{\longrightarrow}\Lambda_R\setminus\{0\}\stackrel{\log}{\longrightarrow}\mathbb R^{r+s}
$$
where $\log$ is defined as (given $x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\Lambda_R\subset\mathbb R^n$)
$$

It is a well know result that $u$ is absolutely continuous (A.C) on a.e. segment of line parallel to the coordinate axes. It seems to me that there is nothing special about the coordinate axes, so indeed if some direction $v\in \partial B(0,1)$ is fixed, we must have that $u$ is (A.C) on a.e. segment of line with direction $v$. In fact, let $T$ be a orthogonal map which sends $v$ to $e_1=(1,0,...,0)$. Let $w(x)=u(T^{-1}(x))$. Then, $w\in W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ and $w$ is (A.C) on a.e. segment of line with direction $e_1$. By definition of $w$, we must conclude that $u$ is (A.C) on a.e. segment of line with direction $v$. My questions are: 1) Is it true that a Sobolev functions is (A.C) for a.e. segment of line?

Then, for each $x \in C$, it must be the case that either $x \notin \overline{A}$ or $x \notin \overline{X-A}$. If $x \notin \overline{A}$, pick an open set $U_x$ in $X$ such that $x \in U_x \subseteq X-A$, and set $V_x = \varnothing$. Otherwise, it must be the case that $x \notin \overline{X-A}$. In this case, pick an open set $V_x$ in $X$ such that $x \in V_x \subseteq A$ and set $U_x = \varnothing$. Now, note that the sets $C \cap \bigcup_{x \in C} U_x$ and $C \cap \bigcup_{x \in C} V_x$ are open in $C$ under the subspace topology and are also nonempty (since there exists an $x \in C$ belonging to $\overline{A}$ and a $y \in C$ belonging to $\overline{X-A}$, otherwise one of $C \cap \overline{A}$ and $C \cap \overline{X-A}$ is nonempty, which implies that one of $C \cap A$ and $C \cap (X-A)$ is empty, a contradiction.) By the choice of each $U_x$ and $V_x$, it can easily be seen that that $C \cap \bigcup_{x \in C} U_x$ and $C \cap \bigcup_{x \in C} V_x$ are disjoint, and their union equals $C$.

908499,Is a functional derivative a generalized function?,"I am just now learning about elementary distribution theory, and it seems that theory may bear on the topic of functional differentiation, which I've encountered in some books on quantum field theory (QFT).  I'm not looking for mathematical rigor, but just a bit more information to help me understand functional differentiation. One definition I've seen of the functional derivative $δJ[f]/δf(x)$ of a functional $J[f]$ is the implicit definition 
$$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac {δJ[f]}{δf(\xi)} η(\xi) d\xi = \lim_ {ε→0} \frac{F[f+εη]-F[f]}ε.$$ 
Here $η$ is the variation of the function $f$, which in turn is the argument of the functional $J$.  The QFT books seemed to regard the functional derivative as an ordinary function of position x, but it seems to me that it might be a generalized function (distribution); such don't necessarily have numeric values at specific positions x. Is $δJ[f]/δf(x)$ an ordinary function or a generalized function? What kind of functions are allowed as variations $η$? It seems to me that maybe---as in distribution theory---one wants to allow only infinitely differentiable functions, perhaps with compact support or perhaps which decrease very fast as one goes to infinity. One QFT book I looked at exhibited an explicit definition of $δJ[f]/δf(x)$, apparently obtained from the above definition by setting $η(y) = δ(y-x)$ = (Dirac delta ""function"" representing a unit impulse at x).

908528,The topology generated by a basis is the intersection of all topologies containing that basis.,"This question is from Munkres' Topology , section 13, exercise 5. I ask for verification and/or comments upon mistakes and inaccuracies. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a basis for a topology on $X$ . We are to show that the topology generated by $\mathcal{A}$ is the intersection of all topologies on $X$ containing $\mathcal{A}$ . Here is my claimed solution: Let $\{\tau_{\alpha}\}$ be the family of topologies containing $\mathcal{A}$ . Consider the incersection $\bigcap_{a \in \alpha}\tau_{a}$ . It is clear that this intersection contains $\mathcal{A}$ , and moreover, is a topology, since for any two elements that are shared, intersections and unions must be shared, by the definition of a topology. We proceed to show that $\bigcap_{a\in\alpha}\tau_a \subset \tau_{\mathcal{A}}$ . Let $U$ be an arbitrary element of $\bigcap_{a\in\alpha}\tau_a$ . We see that $U$ must either be in $\mathcal{A}$ or be a union or intersection of elements of $\mathcal{A}$ , since $\bigcap_{a\in\alpha}\tau_a$ is clearly the largest topology containing every topology containing $\mathcal{A}$ , and by the definition of a topology, this must be exactly the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ and unions and intersections therein. $\bigcap_{a\in\alpha}\tau_a \supset \tau_{\mathcal{A}}$ follows directly. What I am not sure about here is ""...by the definition of a topology, this must be exactly the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ and unions and intersections therein."" Since the intersection is the largest topology containing every $\tau_\alpha$ , any other element could imply new elements by unions and intersections, creating a new topology not necessarily contained in every $\tau_\alpha$ . While I am somewhat confident that my intuition here is correct, I feel that my argument lacks a certain precision.","['general-topology', 'proof-verification']"

To be more specific, let us assume $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ to be compact.$^1$ Then we would like to prove that this implies that $K$ is closed.$^2$ Stephen Abbott proceeds by considering a sequence $(x_n)$ with $x = \lim x_n$, where $(x_n)$ is contained in $K$. By definition of a compact set, the sequence $(x_n)$ has a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k})$, and it follows from a well-known theorem$^3$ that $(x_{n_k})$ converges to the same limit $x$. Finally, the definition of a compact set requires that $x \in K$. Then according to Stephen Abbott, this proves that $K$ is closed. But in his prove he has assumed that the sequence $(x_n)$ converges. What happens if $(x_n)$ does not converge?  Then we can still have a subsequence that converges to a limit, right? If so, then I think his theorem is incomplete, or am I missing something? $^1$ A set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is compact if every sequence in $K$ has a subsequence that converges to a limit that is also in $K$. $^2$ A set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is closed if it contains its limit points.$^{2.1}$ $^{2.1}$ A point $x$ is a limit point of a set $K$ if every $\epsilon$-neighborhood $V_\epsilon (x)$ of $x$ intersects the set $K$ in some point other than $x$. $^3$ Subsequences of a convergent sequence converge to the same limit as the original sequence.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

I remember being frustrated by the plethora of abstract proofs without much in the way of how to use them to get actual results. It seems that every theorem in intro stoch. processes is about when something is a martingale (super/sub) under various operations OR if a particular stopping time is finite. My difficulty was always translating these theorems to concrete results. Calculating actual hitting time probabilities, for example, always seemed to reduce to a large (or possibly infinite) number of conditional probably statements to calculate. The actual answers always involved just a few elegant lines, so I knew I was missing something. My questions as follows : What types of stochastic processes are even solvable in closed from (i.e., when do you have to use a computer?...if that's easier to answer). I think Martingales are, but how general is that? For martingales, should I approach them indirectly, by setting up some sort of recursive relation or a relation that directly uses the quantity I want (E.g., $P(X_{t \wedge \tau} = x))$, as opposed to trying to directly derive the answer? For sub/super Martingales, is the strategy to reduce them to a martingale (for example, via Doob decomposition $X=M+A$ and then correcting the $A$ term to make it a martingale) and then apply martingale strategy above? I think that was my major stumbling point back in college...I had taken engineering calculus and mathematical statistics, but I felt it didn't equip me with the correct mindset for stoch. processes.

The symmetric algebra $S(V)$ is a quotient of the tensor algebra $T(V)$ . The symmetric product $v \cdot w$ of elements of $V$ does not make sense a priori in $T(V)$ , but one can identify $S(V)$ with the space of symmetric tensors , which is a subspace of $T(V)$ where the restriction of the projection map $T(V) \to S(V)$ is an isomorphism. Under this isomorphism, the symmetric product $v \cdot w$ corresponds to the element $\dfrac{v \otimes w + w \otimes v}{2}$ of $T(V)$ . Same story for the exterior algebra $\Lambda(V)$ and alternating tensors: the wedge product $v \wedge w$ is identified with the alternating tensor $\dfrac{v \otimes w - w \otimes v}{2}$ . So contrary to what I have read in some places (e.g. accepted answer here ), in my opinion there is one natural way to identify symmetric products to symmetric tensors (resp. wedge products to alternating tensors) 1 . Conclusion: at least from the algebraic point of view, it seems to me that the natural thing to say is: $dx \, dy = \dfrac{dx \otimes dy + dy \otimes dx}{2}$ $dx \wedge dy = \dfrac{dx \otimes dy - dy \otimes dx}{2}$ Differential geometry : Again, I feel like there is only one choice we want to make here, contrary to what I have read sometimes: $dx \, dy = \dfrac{dx \otimes dy + dy \otimes dx}{2}$ , because $dxdx + dydy = dx^2 + dy^2 $ should be the standard metric (or inner product) on $\mathbb{R}^2$ (who would want $dx^2 + dy^2$ to mean something else?) $dx \wedge dy = dx \otimes dy - dy \otimes dx$ because $dx \wedge dy$ should be the standard area form (or determinant) on $\mathbb{R}^2$ (again, who would want $dx \wedge dy$ to mean something else 2 ?). Unfortunately, the answer 2. is different than what we found from the algebraic point of view. Worse, the choices made for the symmetric product and the wedge product do not seem to be consistent. Does anyone feel like they have a satisfying way to understand this issue? $$$$ 1 as I have tried to explain briefly. Said differently, it is natural to ask that the identification $\mathrm{Sym}^2 V \stackrel{\sim}{\to}  S^2V$ should be the restriction of the projection map $p: V\otimes V \to S^2V$ . (Same story for the wedge product). 2 Said differently, when one defines integration of differential forms, integrating $f(x, y)\, dx \wedge dy$ should produce the Lebesgue integral $\int f(x,y) dx\,dy$ . I don't think anyone uses a different convention (?). Other remark: in complex differential geometry, I find the most natural identity between a Kähler Hermitian metric $h$ , the Riemannian metric $g$ and the Kähler form $\omega$ to be $h = g - i\omega$ . Try $h = dz \otimes d\overline{z}$ : then $g = dx \otimes dx + dy \otimes dy$ and $\omega = dx \otimes dy - dy \otimes dx$ . It is nice to write $g = dx^2 + dy^2$ and $\omega = dx \wedge dy$ , in particular, the Kähler form is the area form of the Riemannian metric.","['differential-geometry', 'differential-forms', 'tensor-products', 'exterior-algebra', 'multilinear-algebra']"

908986,How to prove a given statistical test has the greatest power,"It is very conventional in evaluating the null hypothesis to consider the distribution of the mean of a sample of some size if the null hypothesis were true and to compare the mean of your own sample to that distribution.  (At least if the underlying distribution is thought to be normal) But why, even given the normality assumption, do statisticians generally compare the distribution of the mean to the sample mean as opposed to comparing the distribution of some other statistic, say the median or the minimum, to the median (or minimum) of the sample. I believe the answer to my question is that the mean is a powerful statistic.  If the sample indeed did not come from the null hypothesis distribution, then the mean test is likely to pick it up.  It might take a much greater effect for the median or min test to obtain an adequately low p-value?  But, how do we KNOW that there are not better statistics than the mean?  Is there a proof out there in the literature?  Or how would one possibly go about proving it?",['statistics']
908989,show that $ \lim(\sin(\frac{1}{x}))$ as $x$ approaches zero does not exist.,I am stuck trying to understand how to prove that the limit of $\sin(\frac{1}{x})$ as $x$ approaches $0$ does not exist. a hint was given: a limit does not exist if there exists an $\varepsilon > 0$ such that for every $\eta>0$ there exists an $x$ with $0<|x-a|<\eta$ whenever $|f(x)-L|\geq \varepsilon$. so I approached this by stating that $|x|<\eta$ then $\sin(\frac{1}{x})-L\geq \varepsilon$. then I set $\varepsilon \leq|f(x)-L|<\sin(\frac{\eta}{2x})-L$ then used inverse sine to try and get delta alone... but now I'm looking at it trying to figure out what i did and why i did it. can someone please walk me through a proof that this limit does not exist and maybe try and explain it to me.

908990,Integration being the opposite of differentiation?,"I know that if we start with an original function and take one derivative, we get another function. If we take the integral of that new function we get the original function back. So I see how they are opposite operations but I don't see how they are opposite in the sense that the integral is supposed to be the area under the curve and the derivative is supposed to be the instantaneous slope. It seems like they are separate; deriving one function is the opposite of integrating it but when we look at it graphically it doesn't make sense. Also, if I start with some function, differentiate it and then take the integral I get the original function so how is that the area under the curve? Thanks.",['calculus']
909012,Understanding probabilities in a puzzle solution,"I'm having a problem understanding a solution based on probabilities in the following puzzle: Puzzle: There is a ""triangular"" duel between the three shooters. Everyone shoots one by one, can shoot once and any person he wants. Smith always hits the target (100%) and shoots last. Brown hits the target 80% of the time and shoots second. Jones is the worst, hitting the target only 50% of the time and he shoots first. Who should Jones shoot in order to increase his chance of surviving? Answer: Jones should shoot in the air. The worst shooter has the best chance of surviving in the triangular duel, which is Jones. After him goes Smith who never misses the target. Since Smith and Brown will be shooting each other when their turn comes, Jones must shoot no one until one of his enemies dies. After that he shoots at his enemy, again having an advantage. First, it's easier to calculate the probability of surviving for Smith. In the duel with Brown he shoots first with a probability of 1/2. In this case he kills Brown. Brown also shoots first with a probability of 1/2. Smith survives with a probability of 1/5. Thus, Smith will live over Brown with a probability of 1/2 + 1/2 * 1/5 = 3/5 . With a probability of 1/2, Smith survives the duel with Jones. All in all: the probability to survive for Smith is 3/5 * 1/2 = 3/10. The probability for Brown to survive the duel with Smith is 2/5 . Then Jones shoots Brown. In the first round, Brown has a probability of 1/2 * 4/5 = 4/10 to win. In the second round, he has a probability of 1/2 * 1/5 * 1/2 * 4/5 = 4/100 . Thus, Brown has a chance to survive Jones: 4/10 + 4/100 + 4/1000 + 4/10000 = 0.4444(4) = 4/9 . The probability of Brown to survive both of his opponents is equal to 2/5 (over Smith) * 4/9 (over Jones) = 8/45. The probability of Jones to survive = 1 - 3/10 - 8/45 = 47/90. In bold are the calculations I'm confused about and don't know how to arrive at. Can someone please explain it? Thank you.","['puzzle', 'probability']"

I've proved that if such space is regular, then it is metrizable. The proof relies on the ability to find Lindelöf neighborhoods inside metrizable ones, so any counterexample must be non-hereditarily Lindelöf. Unfortunately, the only few examples of such spaces I'm familiar with fail to satisfy some conditions: the particular point topology on an uncountable set is not even T 1 ; uncountable products of compact sets are not first countable; the unit square with lexicographic order is regular.","['general-topology', 'examples-counterexamples']"

909122,Writing sum of square roots with symmetric polynomials,"I want to write the function 
$$
F_N=\sum_{i=1}^N\sqrt{x_i}
$$
in terms of the $N$ elementary symmetric polynomials of the $N$ positive variables $x_1,\dots,x_N$. The $N=1$ case is trivial, as we have $F_1=\sqrt{x_1}$ so $$F_1=\sqrt{s_1}$$ The $N=2$ case is simple, as we have $F_2^2=(\sqrt{x_1}+\sqrt{x_2})^2=x_1+x_2+2\sqrt{x_1x_2}$, which means that $$F_2=\sqrt{s_1+2\sqrt{s_2}}$$ The $N=3$ case is not so simple, but after a bit one finds $$F_3=\sqrt{s_1+2\sqrt{s_2+2\sqrt{s_3}F_3}}$$
so one can at least solve for $F_3$. There is kind of a pattern evolving here. However, I cannot proceed beyond $N=3$... Any insights? EDIT: I'm not sure this is helpful, but as $F_N$ is an eigenfunction of the operator $2\sum_ix_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$, one can easily find that $$F_N=\sqrt{s_1}G_N\left(\frac{s_2}{s_1^2},\frac{s_3}{s_1^3},\dots,\frac{s_N}{s_1^N}\right)$$
where $G_N$ is a function of $N-1$ arguments. EDIT 2: Actually, $F_N$ is an eigenfunction of the operators $$\frac{2 (-1)^{n-1}}{(1/2)_{n-1}}\sum_ix_i^n\frac{\partial^n}{\partial x_i^n}$$ for every positive integer $n$, where $(a)_n$ is the Pochhammer symbol.

909128,$y'' + 4y = \sin^3(2x)$ Continuation of question,"I have to find the solution for $y'' + 4y = \sin^3 (2x)$. We can use an identity to transform our equation to: $y'' + 4y = (3/4)\sin(2x) - (1/4) \sin(6x)$.  Our guess for the particular solution would then be: $y_p = A\sin(2x) + B\sin(6x)$. I am, however, having trouble solving for A and B. $y_p = A\sin(2x) + B\sin(6x)4$ $y^{(1)}_p = 2A\cos(2x) + 6B\cos(6x)$ $y^{(2)}_p = -4(A\sin(2x) + 9B\sin(6x))$ So then we plug these back into our non-homogeneous differential equation, $y'' + 4y = sin^3(2x)$, and we get: $-4(A\sin(2x) + 9B\sin(6x)) + 4(A\sin(2x) + B\sin(6x)) = (3/4)\sin(2x) - (1/4)\sin(6x)$ Simplifying we will find that the sines with the A coefficient cancel out.

Then $f$ is ______ . If in the blanks we put the word ""differentiable"", the proposition is false. (This is exercise 10-17 in Spivak's Calculus , 4th ed.) A counterexample is $f:x\mapsto |x|$, $g:x\mapsto \left(\frac{x}{|x|}\right) x^2$. If in the blanks we put the word ""continuous"", I propose that the statement is true. I will place my proof below the fold. What about if we put in other words, such as ""analytic"", or ""$C^\infty$""? Prop: Suppose $g$ and $f \circ g$ are continuous, and $g$ achieves every value in $\mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is continuous. Proof : Suppose for contradiction that $f$ is discontinuous at $\alpha$. Then one of the following cases must obtain: Case A: $\lim_{x\to \alpha^+} f(x) \not\exists$ or $\lim_{x\to \alpha^+} f(x) \neq f(\alpha)$. Case B: $\lim_{x\to \alpha^-} f(x) \not\exists$ or $\lim_{x\to \alpha^-} f(x) \neq f(\alpha)$.
