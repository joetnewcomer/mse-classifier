404157,$n^5-n$ is divisible by $10$?,"I was trying to prove this, and I realized that this is essentially a statement that $n^5$ has the same last digit as $n$, and to prove this it is sufficient to calculate $n^5$ for $0-9$ and see that the respective last digits match. Another approach I tried is this: I factored $n^5-n$ to $n(n^2+1)(n+1)(n-1)$. If $n$ is even, a factor of $2$ is guaranteed by the factor $n$. If $n$ is odd, the factor of $2$ is guaranteed by $(n^2+1)$. The factor of $5$ is guaranteed if the last digit of $n$ is $1, 4, 5, 6,$ $or$ $9$ by the factors $n(n+1)(n-1)$, so I only have to check for $n$ ending in digits $0, 2, 3, 7,$ $and$ $8$.

404236,Motivation behind definition of normal domain,"An integral domain $A$ is called normal if it equals its integral closure in its field of fractions K. I can appreciate the condition of a ring being equal to its integral closure inside some ring, but why is it especially important that a ring equals its integral closure in its field of fractions ? Evidently we need to have some natural way of assigning to each ring a larger ring in which to check the condition of being integrally closed. However, the analogous concept for fields of algebraic closure does not depend on an embedding into a larger ring or field. How does one explain this discrepancy? In number theory there are examples of rings which are integrally closed in their fields of fractions but not in field extensions, e.g. $\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{Q}( \sqrt 2 )$. Are there any rings $A$ which are integrally closed in any ring $B \supset A$? (This is true for algebraically closed fields, is it not?) Why is this not a better definition for integrally closed? I can see that integrally closed rings have a plethora of nice properties, so obviously it is a good definition, but can anyone give me a little more confidence that this was the correct definition to have chosen? I would be happy with algebraic explanations from commutative algebra or number theory or geometric explanations from algebraic geometry.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

404288,Maximal ideals in polynomial rings over a field,"Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field and let $k$ be a subfield of $K$ such that the field extension $K \mid k$ is algebraic. Let $B$ be the polynomial ring $K [x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ and let $A$ be the subring $k [x_1, \ldots, x_n]$. It is clear that any $k$-subalgebra of $K$ is a field, so it follows that the intersection of $A$ and any maximal ideal of $B$ is a maximal ideal of $A$. Moreover, every maximal ideal of $A$ arises in this way. Question. What are the maximal ideals of $A$, described in terms of the maximal ideals of $B$? It is well-known that the maximal ideals of $B$ are all of the form $(x_1 - a_1, \ldots, x_n - a_n)$ for some $n$-tuple $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ of elements of $K$. Thus, for each maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$, we may define the set
$$P(\mathfrak{m}) = \{ (a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in K^n : (x_1 - a_1, \ldots, x_n - a_n) \cap A = \mathfrak{m} \}$$
and this set is finite (because it is a 0-dimensional closed subset of $\mathbb{A}^n_K$). Consider $G = \mathrm{Aut}(K \mid k)$. Of course, $G$ acts on $B$, and every element of $A$ is invariant under the action of $G$, so it follows that $P (\mathfrak{m})$ is closed under the action of $G$ in $K^n$ as well, i.e. $P (\mathfrak{m})$ is the union of $G$-orbits. Conjecture. $G$ acts transitively on $P (\mathfrak{m})$. This is certainly true if $k$ is a perfect field and $n = 1$ โ after all, in that case, $\mathfrak{m}$ is a principal ideal generated by a polynomial in one variable irreducible over $k$. In fact this is true even without the assumption that $k$ is perfect: we know that the residue field $\kappa (\mathfrak{m}) = A / \mathfrak{m}$ is a finite field extension of $k$ and that the right $G$-set of $k$-algebra embeddings $\kappa (\mathfrak{m}) \to K$ is isomorphic to the right $G$-set of zeros in $K$ for the generator of $\mathfrak{m}$; but the homomorphism extension property of $\kappa (\mathfrak{m}) \to K$ implies that any two embeddings can be connected by an isomorphism of $K$, so $G$ acts transitively on the set of $k$-algebra embeddings $\kappa (\mathfrak{m}) \to K$. What about the general case where $n > 1$? I had always taken for granted that the indicated conjecture was true, but I have not been able to find a proof in the usual places. By descent theory, one can show that
$$\operatorname{Spec} B \otimes_k B \rightrightarrows \operatorname{Spec} B \to \operatorname{Spec} A$$
is a coequaliser diagram in the category of schemes, so $\operatorname{Spec} A$ is a scheme-theoretic quotient of $\operatorname{Spec} B$ by an internal equivalence relation, but it is not clear to me what this internal equivalence relation is when $n > 0$. (For $n = 0$ and $k$ perfect, something quite remarkable happens: $\operatorname{Spec} K \otimes_k K$ has a canonical continuous free transitive action of $\mathrm{Gal}(K \mid k)$!)","['galois-theory', 'commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request']"

404319,Angular distribution of lines passing through two squares.,"Let's say I've got two squares with side length $d$ that are held parallel at a distance $m$ apart. Suppose that particles are randomly falling from above in such a way that the polar angle $\varphi$ of the trajectory of the particles has a probability distribution proportional to $\operatorname{cos}^2(\varphi)$, while the azimuthal angle is uniformly distributed. A particle is admissible if it passes through both squares. Can we find a closed form expression for the probability distribution of the polar angle of admissible particles?  (or at least a good numerical solution?) My attempt at a stronger formulation: First, let's normalize the problem by letting $\alpha=m/d$ and assuming each square has unit side length.  We may assume that the point at which the particle passes through Panel $1$ (the upper panel) is uniformly distributed, that is, there are a uniformly distributed variables $X_1$ and $Y_1$, each between $0$ and $1$, and the point of contact on the plane of panel $1$ is $$\mathfrak{X}_1=\left(\begin{array}{c}X_1\\Y_1\\ \alpha\end{array}\right).$$  In order to be admissible, a particle must pass through Panel $1$, and we are only interested in admissible particles, so this is our universe of particles. Let's find the point of contact $\mathfrak{X}_2$ on the plane of Panel $2$ (the lower panel).  We need $$\left(\begin{array}{c}X_1+t\operatorname{sin}(\varphi)\operatorname{cos}(\theta)\\ Y_1+t\operatorname{sin}(\varphi)\operatorname{sin}(\theta)\\ \alpha+t\operatorname{cos}(\varphi)\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}X_2\\Y_2\\0\end{array}\right)$$
so $t=-\alpha\operatorname{sec}(\varphi)$, from which we have $$\mathfrak{X}_2=\left(\begin{array}{c}X_1-\alpha\operatorname{tan}(\varphi)\operatorname{cos}(\theta)\\Y_1-\alpha\operatorname{tan}(\varphi)\operatorname{sin}(\theta)\\0\end{array}\right).$$
So, the question is, what is the probability distribution of $\varphi$ for the lines satisfying
$$\begin{array}{rcl}0 \leq& X_1-\alpha\operatorname{tan}(\varphi)\operatorname{cos}(\theta) &\leq  1 \\
0 \leq& Y_1-\alpha\operatorname{tan}(\varphi)\operatorname{sin}(\theta) &\leq 1 \end{array}
$$
given that $$\begin{array}{rl}X_1 \text{ and }Y_1& \text{are uniformly distributed from }0\text{ to }1 \\ \theta &\text{is uniformly distributed from }0\text{ to }2\pi \\ \varphi & \text{has probability distribution }\frac{4}{\pi}\operatorname{cos}^2\varphi\text{ from }\frac{\pi}{2}\text{ to }\pi\end{array}$$
? EDIT 2: So I ran a simulation, yielding the following histogram (displayed below with $3$ different bin widths).  I haven't fit a curve to this yet, but maybe it will give us a hint.

Let $f$ be a continuous function on $E$ and $V$ a open subset on $\mathbb R$. If $f^{-1}(V)=\{\}$, then it is open.  Suppose that $f^{-1}(V)\neq\{\}$. Let $p\in f^{-1}(V)$. Then $f(p)\in V$.

404515,Geometric similarities between points in an algebraic variety,"If $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a univariate irreducible polynomial, Galois theory says that all roots are equivalent up to field automorphism (specifically, an automorphism of the field extension fixing the base field). Can anything similar be said for the multivariate case?  Specifically, if $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ is an irreducible multivariate polynomial, is the local geometry of the zero set $V = f^{-1}(0)$ similar at different points in some sense? Clearly this isn't true at all points of $V$; the easiest counterexample is the lemniscate ( http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Lemniscate.html ), where $V$ is manifold except at one point.  However, $V$ does have some self similarity except at this lower dimensional set: in particular, the curvature elsewhere is nonzero.  As another example, I would expect that $V$ is locally a ruled surface either almost everywhere or almost nowhere.  Is there a general statement that would encompass these and related similarities between different points of $V$? A hint at a possible answer: I believe the statement is true for any geometric property that can be expressed algebraically in terms of the differential structure near $x \in V$, since otherwise adding these equations would separate $V$ into multiple components, contradicting the irreducibility of $V$.",['algebraic-geometry']
404516,Image of closed unit ball under a compact operator,"Let $X,Y$ be Banach spaces and $A\in\mathcal L(X,Y)$ . The task is to prove the following: $A$ is compact if and only if the image of the closed unit ball in $X$ is compact in $Y$ . I have proven this when $X$ is a reflexive space. Proof. Let $X$ be a reflexive space, $\bar B$ the closed unit ball in $X$, and $A$ a compact operator. Let further $y_n=Ax_n$ be a sequence in $A(\bar B)$. In reflexive spaces $\bar B$ is weakly compact, so there exists a subsequence $x_{n_j} \to x$ weakly. Because $A$ is compact, $Ax_{n_j}\to Ax$ strongly. On the other side, $A(\bar B)$ is relatively compact, so there exists $z_k=Ax_{n_{j_k}}$ that converges strongly to $y\in Y$. But $z_k\to Ax$ strongly. So by unicity of the limit $y=Ax$ and the image is compact. It's easily proved that if the image is compact, the operator is also compact. But I don't know what to do in case of nonreflexive spaces. Is there any counterexample or proof in such case?","['proof-writing', 'functional-analysis']"

A subset $A\subseteq X$ is defined to be open , if $A$ is a neighborhood of each of its points, i.e. $A\in\mathcal{B}(x)$ for every $x\in A$ .  Evidently, open sets satisfy the following properties: (O1) $X, \varnothing$ are open sets; (O2) if $U_1, \dots, U_n$ are open sets, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is an open set; (O3) if $U_\alpha, \alpha\in J$ , is a collection of open sets, then $\bigcup\{U_\alpha : \alpha \in J\}$ is an open set.

A topology for $X$ is then defined as the family of all open subsets of $X$. I would like to know who first proposed this particular approach to defining a topology. (Note that another approach first defines open sets, and then defines neighborhoods in term of open sets.  Yet another approach takes the closure of a set as the fundamental definition.  Etc.) EDIT: The motivation behind this question can be found in this other question .  In that question I give a verbatim rendition of a set of axioms defining neighborhoods and then defining open sets in terms of neighborhoods.  I argue that these axioms, as stated, are faulty.  Later (in my answer to the question) I show what I believe is the genesis of the error.  The problem lies in the subtle difference between the following two alternative versions of one of the axioms: (B$3$) for each $x$, the set of neighborhoods of $x$ is closed under non-infinite intersections; (B$3^{\prime}$) if $U_1, \dots, U_n$ are neighborhoods of $x$, then $U_1 \cap \dots \cap U_n$ is a neighborhood of $x$; (Of course, one typically writes finite instead of the awkward non-infinite , but I've used the latter in (B$3$) to bring out the fact that the axiom applies to the empty intersection as well.  IOW, the axiom implies that, for each $x \in X$, the entire set $X$ is a neighborhood of $x$.) In fact I've come across even more emphatic versions of (B$3^\prime$): (B$3^{\prime\prime}$) if $U_1$ and $U_2$ are neighborhoods of $x$, then $U_1 \cap U_2$ is a neighborhood of $x$; The problem with (B$3^\prime$) and (B$3^{\prime\prime}$) is that they fail to rule out the case in which some $x \in X$ has no neighborhoods at all, which in turn will imply that the entire space $X$ is not open. My interest in this question is that I have found at least three separate mentions in the literature of the faulty set of axioms, one as recent as 1997.  It appears that this is a case of an error that has been propagated for decades, and I'm curious about its origin.

My first reaction to this was that it is indeed obvious as $S$ is composed of discrete points so I could find a ball around any given point not containing a point of $S$. So, if $p \in \mathbb{R}^k$ is the point I'm constructing a ball around, taking the radius of the ball as $r = \min_{x_n \neq p \in S} \{ \vert x_n - p \vert \}$ should work and as $p$ was arbitrary $S$ doesn't have a limit point. However, I'm not sure if I can take the minimum over an infinite set? I honestly don't know why I shouldn't be able to, but nonetheless I decided to try another proof: Suppose that $S$ has a limit point $p \in \mathbb{R}^k$. Then for any $r > 0$ $B_r(p)$ has infinitely many points of $S$. So in particular, $B_{\frac{1}{2}}(p)$ contains infinitely many points of $S$. Therefore, there exists a point $y_m \in B_{\frac{1}{2}}(p)$ with $\vert y_m \vert > m > \vert p \vert + 1$ (as otherwise, there would be only finitely many points of $S$ in $B_{\frac{1}{2}}(p)$). Therefore, we have $$\vert y_m - p \vert \geq \big\vert \vert y_m \vert - \vert p \vert \big\vert > 1 $$ However, this is a contradition as we also have $\vert y_m - p \vert < \frac{1}{2}$.

404836,How to show annihilator has dimension m-n (with Proof),"I would like to show the following: Given a vector spaces $V$, a subspace $S \subset V$ and an the dual space $V^*$ to $V$.
Show that: $$\dim(N)+\dim(S) = \dim(V) = \dim(V^*)$$, where $N \subset V^*$ is the annihilator to $S$. Assume only finite dimensional vector spaces. I tried a proof but I am not sure if this is correct: Proof: I give a try :-) Assume that $\dim(S) = m$, $\dim(V) = \dim(V^*) = n$ The annihilator is given as: $$N:= \{ \boldsymbol{\alpha} \mid   \langle \boldsymbol{\alpha},\mathbf{x} \rangle =0 \quad ,\quad \forall \mathbf{x} \in S \}$$
Where $ \langle \boldsymbol{\alpha},x \rangle$ is the duality pairing, it is a bilinear form as:
$$ \begin{aligned} \textrm{B}(  \boldsymbol{\alpha},\mathbf{x} ) :   V^* \times V &\rightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
\boldsymbol{\alpha},\mathbf{x} &\mapsto \langle \boldsymbol{\alpha} ,\mathbf{x} \rangle
\end{aligned}
$$ We fix basis vectors for the following spaces: Basis for $V$:   $\{\mathbf{e}_i\}$ with $i \in \{1,n\}$ Basis for $S$: $\{\mathbf{e}_i\}$ with $i \in \{1,m\}$ Basis for $V^*$: $\{\boldsymbol{\alpha}^i\}$ with $i \in \{1,n\}$ Now with $\boldsymbol{\beta} =\beta_j \boldsymbol{\alpha}^j \in V^*$ and $\mathbf{x} = x^i \mathbf{e}_i  \in V$, it follows that
$$ \langle \boldsymbol{\beta} ,\mathbf{x} \rangle = \langle \beta_j  \boldsymbol{\alpha}^j ,x^i \mathbf{e}_i\rangle = \beta_j \langle \boldsymbol{\alpha}^j , \mathbf{e}_i \rangle  x^i  = \beta_j \ B^j_{\ i} \ x^i \quad i,j \in \{1,n\}$$ We want now for every $\mathbf{x} \in S$ and a corresponding $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in N$ that: $$\begin{aligned}
\langle \boldsymbol{\beta} ,\mathbf{x} \rangle = 0 &= (\beta_1, \cdots, \beta_n)\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 
B^1_{\ 1} & \cdots  & B^1_{\ m} \\
\vdots & \cdots  & \vdots \\
\vdots & \cdots  & \vdots \\
B^n_{\ 1} & \cdots  & B^n_{\ m} 
\end{array} \right) \left(\begin{array}{c} x^1 \\ \vdots \\ x^m\end{array} \right) 
\end{aligned} = [\boldsymbol{\beta}]^\top\mathbf{B}[\mathbf{x}] =[\mathbf{x}]^\top\mathbf{B}^\top [\boldsymbol{\beta}], \quad \forall [\mathbf{x}]
$$
From where follows:
$$\mathbf{B}^\top [\boldsymbol{\beta}] = \mathbf{0}$$
If we assume that $\boldsymbol{\alpha}^i$ is the dual basis vector to $\mathbf{e}_i$ with the property:
$$
\langle \boldsymbol{\alpha}^i, \mathbf{e}_j \rangle = \delta^i_{\ j}
$$, where $\delta^i_{\ j}$ is the Kroenecker Delta.
It follows that $\delta^j_{\ i} = B^j_{\ i}$. Thus $[\boldsymbol{\beta}]$ lies in the Nullspace of $N$, $[\boldsymbol{\beta}] \in \text{Null}(\mathbf{B}^\top)$.

[edit: I have realised by now that my approach was flawed and furthermore that my question needs clarification. So here is my second try.] As I understand the question, we have real valued, i.i.d. random variables $X_1$, ..., $X_n$ with density $f$ and CDF $F$. $X_{(1)}< ... < X_{(n)}$ are the corresponding order statistics with CDF $F_i:=F_{X_{(i)}}$. I know the general formula for the CDF of order statistics. It is given by $$F_i(t)=\sum_{k=i}^n \binom{n}{k}F(t)^k(1-F(t))^{n-k}.$$ Now, the CDF of a random variable is a measurable function. Thus $F(X_{(i)})$ and $F_i(X_{(i)})$ are real valued random variables again. And a) asks for their distribution. Per definition, we have $$F(t)=\mathbb{P}(X_i\leq t).$$ Hence $$F(X_{(i)})=\mathbb{P}(X_i\leq X_{(i)}).$$ This is the probability of the event that any $X_i$ is less or equal $X_{(i)}$. By definition of order statistics, we have $$F(X_{(n)})=\mathbb{P}(X_i\leq X_{(n)})=1,$$ as $X_{(n)}$ is the maximum of the $X_i$. But how do I derive the distribution of $F(X_{(i)})$ for $i \in \{1, ..., n-1\}$?

Then all subgroups of $GL_{2}(\mathbb{F}_{q})$ of order p are conjugate to one another. What I know so far: First of all, $\vert GL_{2}(\mathbb{F}_{q})\vert = q(q+1)(q-1)^2$. If $q=2$, then $p=3$ and  $\vert GL_{2}(\mathbb{F}_{q})\vert =6$. Then the only subgroup of order $p$ is the unique Sylow $3$-subgroup. Of course this subgroup is conjugate to itself. So, now we look at the case where $q$ is an odd prime. Obviously $p \nmid q(q-1)^2$. But, $p$ may not be the largest power of $p$ dividing $q+1$.

  $$\frac{\sqrt[\large 4]{144x^9y^8}}{\sqrt[\large 4]{9x^5y^{-3}}}$$ OK So I think I got it. $$\frac{\sqrt[\large 4]{144x^9y^8}}{\sqrt[\large 4]{9x^5y^{-3}}} = \left(\frac{{144x^9y^8}}{{9x^5y^{-3}}}\right )^{1/4}$$ You can break that down like this -I think-: $$\sqrt[\large 4]{16x^4y^{11}}$$ And then finally: $$2xy^2\sqrt[\large 4]{y^3}$$ EDIT - You can go even further (Thanks amWhy): $$2xy^{\large \frac{11}{4}}$$","['radicals', 'algebra-precalculus']"
405329,Problem $13.7$ in Apostol's Mathematical Analysis.,"I am looking at problem $13.7$ in Apostol's Mathematical Analysis. Let $D=\{|z|<1\}$ and let $f=u+iv$ be such that $(\rm i)$ $u,v\in{\mathcal C}^1(D)$ $(\rm ii)$ $f$ is continuous on $\overline D$ $(\rm iii)$ $f(z)=z$ on $\partial D$ . $(\rm iv)$ $J_f(z)>0$ if $z\in D$ . Show that $(1)$ For every open $\Omega\subseteq D$ , $f(\Omega)$ is open in $f(D)$ . $(2)$ $f(D)$ is an open ball of radius $1$ . $(3)$ For each $w\in f(D)$ , $D\cap f^{-1}(w)$ is finite. I have only proven $(1)$ : PROOF1 Since $u,v$ are of class $\mathcal C^1$ over $D$ , so is $f$ , and since the Jacobian doesn't vanish, the inverse function theorem says that for each $z\in D$ there exists an open nbhd $N_z$ such that $f\mid_{N_z}$ is a diffeomorphism of class $C_1$ , thus $f\mid_{N_z}$ is a homeomorphism, so it is an open map. Let $\Omega\subseteq D$ be open, and choose $z\in\Omega$ . Then there exists $N_z$ as above. Let $\widetilde N_z=N_z\cap \Omega$ . This is open and lies inside $N_z$ so its image under $f\mid_{N_z}$ is open by the above. Then $f(\Omega)=f(\Omega)\cap f(D)=\bigcup_{z\in\Omega}f\left(N_z\right)\cap f(D)$ is the intersection of the union of open sets with $f(D)$ , so it is open in $f(D)$ . $\blacktriangle$ . PROOF2 Suppose that $f(D)\not\subseteq D$ . Then certainly $f(\bar D)\not\subseteq \bar D$ . Thus, there exists $q\in\bar D$ such that $|f(q)|>1$ . But $|f|$ is continuous on the compact $\bar D$ ; thus it attains its maximum on some $p\in\bar D$ . But we cannot have $p\in\partial D$ since we would have $|f(p)|=1$ , so it must be the case $p\in D$ . Let $K=\overline B$ where $B=B(0,r)\; ;\; r=|f(p)|$ . Then $f(\bar D)\subseteq \bar B$ , and $f(p)\in\partial B$ . Let $N_p$ be an open nbhd of $p$ in $D$ . Then we see $f(N_p)$ is not open in $f(D)$ , contrary to what was proven in $(1)$ . It follows that $f(D)\subseteq D$ . PROOF3 Suppose for the sake of a contradiction that there exists $w\in f(D)=D$ such that $D \cap f^{-1}(w)$ is infinite. Since this is a subset of the compact $\bar D$ , it must have an accumulation point in $\alpha \in \bar D$ . Suppose first that $\alpha\in D$ . Then for each $\epsilon >0$ the ball $B(\alpha;\epsilon)$ contains infinitely many points of $\{z\in D:f(z)=w\}$ , in contradiction with the fact $f$ is a local diffeomorphism in $\alpha$ . Suppose $\alpha\in \partial D$ . Then $f(\alpha)=\alpha$ , and by continuity, $f(\alpha)=w$ , which is absurd since $D\cap\partial D=\varnothing$ . $\blacktriangle$ . Chapter $13$ is ""Implicit functions and extremum problems"". I am not sure what theorems to use to prove $(2)$ , and I haven't thought about $(3)$ , so I will worry about $(3)$ later. I want to prove $(2)$ now. Any hints? ADD If $A$ is any set, $\partial A$ denotes its boundary and $\overline A$ its closure.","['multivariable-calculus', 'complex-analysis']"
405332,How to calculate: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n a^n$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : How can I evaluate $\sum_{n=0}^\infty(n+1)x^n$? (24 answers) Closed 11 years ago . I've tried to calculate this sum: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n a^n$$ The point of this is to try to work out the ""mean"" term in an exponentially decaying average. I've done the following: $$\text{let }x = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n a^n$$
$$x = a + a \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (n+1) a^n$$
$$x = a + a (\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n a^n + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a^n)$$
$$x = a + a (x + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a^n)$$
$$x = a + ax + a\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a^n$$
$$(1-a)x = a + a\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a^n$$ Lets try to work out the $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a^n$ part: $$let y = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a^n$$
$$y = a + a \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a^n$$
$$y = a + ay$$
$$y - ay = a$$
$$y(1-a) = a$$
$$y = a/(1-a)$$ Substitute y back in: $$(1-a)x = a + a*(a/(1-a))$$
$$(1-a)^2 x = a(1-a) + a^2$$
$$(1-a)^2 x = a - a^2 + a^2$$
$$(1-a)^2 x = a$$
$$x = a/(1-a)^2$$ Is this right, and if so is there a shorter way? Edit: To actually calculate the ""mean"" term of a exponential moving average we need to keep in mind that terms are weighted at the level of $(1-a)$. i.e. for $a=1$ there is no decay, for $a=0$ only the most recent term counts. So the above result we need to multiply by $(1-a)$ to get the result: Exponential moving average ""mean term"" = $a/(1-a)$ This gives the results, for $a=0$, the mean term is the ""0th term"" (none other are used) whereas for $a=0.5$ the mean term is the ""1st term"" (i.e. after the current term).",['sequences-and-series']
405348,Cardinality and Measurability,"We can show that $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ or ($\mathbb{R}^n$) have same cardinality using the following one-to-one and onto mapping: Say x = (0.123456789....) Then f(x) = {(0.13579...),(0.2468..)} My question is can we claim that the Borel sigma algebra in $\mathbb{R}$ has a correspondent sigma algebra (if it is, is it THE Borel sigma algebra in $\mathbb{R}^2$?) by mapping each Borel set D to $\mathbb{R}^2$ by f(D)? Why or why not could you give the argument?? Similarly (I am more certain of this)
When we have N^n and N using this mapping could we claim that the sigma algebra in N has a correspondent sigma algebra in N^n? Does the statement hold for N^infinity and N as well, if N^infinity and N have the same cardinality ( i am not sure about my last statement)?

405357,When exactly is the dual of $L^1$ isomorphic to $L^\infty$ via the natural map?,"The dual space to the Banach space $L^1(\mu)$ for a sigma-finite measure $\mu$ is $L^\infty(\mu)$, given by the correspondence $\phi \in L^\infty(\mu) \mapsto I_\phi$, where $I_\phi(f) = \int f \cdot \phi \,d\mu$ for $f \in L^1(\mu)$. Now, we consider this for more general measures $\mu$. If $\mu$ is not semifinite, then there is a measurable subset $A$ with $\mu(A) = \infty$ but $\mu(B) = 0$ for every subset $B$ of $A$ with $\mu(B) < \infty$. Any $\phi$ supported on $A$ will then map to the zero functional, so the correspondence is not one-to-one. If $\mu$ is semifinite, the correspondence is one-to-one, but is it onto? Using the Radon-Nikodym Thorem, any member of $L^1(B)^*$ for $\mu(B) < \infty$ can be represented by an $L^\infty(B)$ function class $[\phi_B]$. Unlike in the $\sigma$-finite measure case, however, I do not see an easy way to form a ""patchwork"" $\phi$ with $\phi|_B = \phi_B$ a.e.$[\mu]$. I suspect this may have an easy answer, but it eludes me. Or perhaps there is a well-known counterexample?","['dual-spaces', 'measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'lp-spaces']"
