697094,What's the name of this chaotic system? (Cool pics included.),"I found this playing with a 2D-ODE-system plotter I'm writing. Surely, since it's so simple, it's been found and extensively studied by someone. What's it called? I'd like to look it up and learn a little about it. There's a weird pattern were some are simple spriograph-like graphs and the others are completely chaotic. In case anyone enjoys seeing these as much as I do, I'll add an album on imgur for your viewing pleasure. The titles are of the form ""$x_0$_$y_0$"". These are all rendered with VODE from Scipy with $t_0=0$ and $t_1=1000$. $$
\begin{eqnarray*}
x' &=& \cos(y)+\sin(t) \\
y' &=& \sin(x)+\cos(t)

697096,Prove that any palindrome with an even number of digits is divisible by 11,"Confusing myself here, need some clarification.. First, we consider the palindrome $abccba$ . We can see this can be written as $$a(10^5 + 10^0) + b(10^4 + 10^1) + c(10^3 + 10^2) = a(10^5 + 1) + 10b(10^3 + 1) + 100c(10 + 1)$$ So essentially we see that all palindromes of even digits can be written in the form $x(10^{2k+1} + 1)$ , i.e. we must show that any number of the form $(10^{2k+1} + 1)$ is divisible by $11$ . Base case: $10^{2(0)+1} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11$ , which is clearly divisible by $11$ . Induction hypothesis: Assume that $(10^{2k+1} + 1)$ is divisible by $11$ , we work to show that $(10^{2(k+1)+1} + 1)$ is divisible by $11$ . That is, $(10^{2k+3} + 1) = (10^2\cdot10^{2k+1} + 1) = \dots$ Where am I going wrong?","['induction', 'palindrome', 'number-theory']"
697104,"Joint pdf of $f(x,y)=e^{-(x+y)}$","I am asked to find the joint pdf of $\ f(x,y)=e^{-(x+y)} $
where $x,y$ are between $0$ and $\infty$ or $0$ otherwise. I can see its an exponential distribution, which means its continuous so I started a double integral like this: $\displaystyle\int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x}e^{-y} dy dx$ I tried substituting in $u=e^{-x}$ and $du= -e^{-x} $ $v=e^{-y}$ and $\int v= \int   e^{-y}dy=-e^{-y} $ My result after substituting y for 0 and $\infty$ is $\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x}-e^{-x}dx$ = $-e^{-x}-e^{-x}$ and with limits applied I get $2$. 
I can see that the answer should be EXP(1) since the exponential pdf is $\lambda e^{-\lambda x} $ so for my example $\ e^{-(x+y)} $ it must be $1$. (EXP(1) is the answer in the back of the text book for the marginal pdfs).
Am I on the right track with my integration please or am I doing all of this wrong? Thanks.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'statistical-inference']"
697120,Real numbers via equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences and the Completeness Axiom,"Hi so there's a question in my elementary real analysis course I'm a little bugged about. The question goes: Use the definition of the real numbers via equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences to prove the Completeness Axiom. I tried using proof by contradiction by first stating Completeness is false. Then every nonempty subset S of R that is bounded above has no least upper bound. I wanted to construct a Cauchy sequence of descending upperbounds and show that these upperbounds converge to real number which would be the least upperbound, resulting in a contradiction. Is this a valid method? If so, I'm a little stuck on the details of such a Cauchy sequence. Any help is much appreciated.",['real-analysis']
697151,"Show that if G is a simple graph with at least 4 vertices and 2n-3 edges, it must have two cycles of the same length.","For $n\ge4$ , let G be a simple n-vertex graph with at least $2n - 3$ edges. Prove that G has two cycles of equal length. (West's Introduction to Graph Theory Q 2.1.42) I am trying to prove the above claim. So far I have reasoned as follows: G must be connected because $2n-3\ge n-1$ for $n\ge4$ , and any simple n-vertex graph with at least $n-1$ edges must be connected. Let T be a spanning tree of G. T must have $n-1$ edges. Therefore T has at least $2n-3 - (n-1) = n-2$ fewer edges than G. That is, $|e(G) \setminus e(T)| \ge n-2$ . Each one of these 'extra' edges adds exactly cycle to G, so G has at least $n-1$ cycles, each with length 3 to n. Because there are at least n-2 cycles in G, it suffices to show that $n-2$ of these edges cannot all have distinct sizes. (I'm unsure about this line... is this a correct statement?) From here I've lost my way, but I think I am on the right track. For what it's worth, this question appears right after the section that introduces trees, spanning trees, and their properties etc. Thank you!","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'trees']"
697160,"Meaning of ""almost everywhere"" in measure theory.","I'm slightly confused about the term almost everywhere as it is used in Folland's real analysis. Given a measure space $(X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)$  Suppose $f \equiv g$, $\mu$-almost everywhere where $f, g : X \to \mathbb{R}$. Does this mean that $$\mu(\{x : f(x) \ne g(x) \}) = 0$$ Or that there exists a measurable set $E$ such that $\{x : f(x) \ne g(x) \} \subseteq E$ and $\mu(E) = 0$? This issue came up when my professor was proving the following theorem from Folland: To prove (a) $\implies$ $\mu$ is complete, he took a null set $N \in \mathcal{M}$ and said for any $E \subseteq N$, $1_E \equiv 0$ almost everywhere.  This part confused me, because how can we know if $E$ is measurable?","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
697201,The functor $\mathrm{Haus}\to\mathrm{Set}$ sending a space to its set of open sets is not representable?,"I know the contravariant functor $\mathrm{Top}\to\mathrm{Set}$ sending a topological space to its set of open sets is representable, with representing object being the two point space with precisely one singleton being the only nontrivial open set. Why do things not work in the category of Hausdorff spaces? Towards a contradiction, I suppose the functor $F$ is representable, so $F(-)\cong\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathrm{Haus}}(-,A)$ for some representing space $A$. In particular, $F(A)\cong\operatorname{Hom}(A,A)$. Let $U\in F(A)$ be the universal element corresponding to $\mathrm{id}_A$. Then for any space $B$, and any $V\in F(B)$, there is a unique morphism $f\colon A\to B$ such that $F(f)(V)=U$, i.e., $f^{-1}(V)=U$. This unique morphism is $\eta_B^{-1}(\eta_A(U))$ where $\eta_X$ is the component morphism $F(X)\to\mathrm{Hom}(X,A)$. This claim certainly seems unlikely, so that $F$ is not representable. However, I'm having trouble coming up with a concrete example to show this cannot be.","['general-topology', 'category-theory']"

697241,limit of increasing sequence of measures is a measure,"Statement Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measurable space and let $(\mu_n)_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of measure in this space.

If we define, for every $E \in \Sigma$ $\space$  $\mu(E)=\lim_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(E)$, prove that $\mu$ is a measure.

$[x: x \in A \lor x \in B]$ so that means that x belongs in A or x belongs in B For the right side I would have set intersection $[x: x \in A \land x \in C]$ so x belongs in A and x belongs in C $[x: x \in B \land x \in C]$ so x belongs in B and x belongs in C so maybe it's like this? $[x: x \in A \land x \in C] \lor [x: x \in B \land x \in C]$ and then by distributive law I would have gotten $[x: x \in A \lor x \in B] \land C$ which becomes $(A \cup B) \cap C$ My question is how do I write a better proof than this jumbled mess?","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"
697327,What is the generalization of Gauss's Theorem to a manifold?,"In a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold with constant basis vectors, one certainly has that the integral of the divergence of a tensor field $T$ over a submanifold $\Omega$ is equal to the integral over the boundary $\partial\Omega$ of the inner product of $T$ with the outward-directed unit normal vector. To be more explicit, in component form in Minkowski space,
$$ \int\limits_\Omega \partial_\mu {{T^\alpha}_\beta}^\mu \ \mathrm{d}x^0 \wedge \mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \mathrm{d}x^2 \wedge \mathrm{d}x^3 = \int\limits_{\partial\Omega} {{T^\alpha}_\beta}^\mu \varepsilon_{\mu|\alpha\beta\gamma|} \ \mathrm{d}x^\alpha \wedge \mathrm{d}x^\beta \wedge \mathrm{d}x^\gamma, $$
where I'm using the convention in Misner, Thorne, & Wheeler that $|\alpha\beta\gamma|$ runs over all indices such that $0 \leq \alpha < \beta < \gamma \leq 3$, and $\epsilon$ is the Levi-Civita symbol/tensor (there being no difference in the lowered-index form in Minkowski space). The problem is, the proof given in that book only makes sense in Cartesian coordinates. What if I have some arbitrary coordinates in a curved manifold? Is there an analogous equation relating
$$ \int\limits_\Omega \nabla_\mu {{T^\alpha}_\beta}^\mu \sqrt{|g|} \ \mathrm{d}^4x \leftrightarrow \int\limits_{\partial\Omega} {{T^\alpha}_\beta}^\mu n_\mu \sqrt{|\gamma|} \ \mathrm{d}^3x? $$
(Here $\nabla$ is the covariant derivative compatible with the metric, $g$ is the determinant of the metric, and $\gamma$ is the determinant of the induced metric on the surface.) Wald 1 shows in an appendix that
$$ \int\limits_\Omega \nabla_\mu v^\mu = \int\limits_{\partial\Omega} v^\mu n_\mu, $$
where I've followed his lead and suppressed the volume elements. This would seem to indicate that I can follow a naive ""partial to covariant"" prescription to make my first equation turn into my second. But does this work for arbitrary tensors? I worry because rank $(1,0)$ tensors can have fortuitous cancellations, such as how $\nabla_\mu v^\mu = \partial_\mu (\sqrt{|g|} v^\mu) / \sqrt{|g|}$ holds without extra connection terms. 1 Yes, another physics book.

697337,Understanding the definition of the empirical measure,"I'm reading Kosorok's Introduction to Empirical Processes and Semiparametric Inference and I'm stuck on an important definition. We define the empirical measure to be $P_n=n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n\delta_{X_i}$, where $\delta_x$ is the measure that assigns mass 1 at $x$ and zero elsewhere. For a measurable function $f : X \rightarrow R$, we denote $P_nf=n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^nf(X_i)$. First, let me take a crack at $P_n$: is it the same as $n^{-1}\delta_{U_{i}X_i}$ where I use $U_{i}X_i$ to denote the union of the points $X_i$ over $i$? Does $P_n$ inherently only work on functions?

is it the case that the localization of $A$ at any of its prime ideals is an integral domain? Discussion Recall that $A$ is reduced if it contains no nonzero nilpotents, i.e. $Nil(A)=\{0\}$. I have already shown the following two facts: A ring $A$ being reduced is a local property, i.e. $A$ is reduced if and only if the localization of $A$ at any prime ideal is reduced. $A$ reduced does not imply $A$ is an integral domain (in general). The counter example I used to prove $2$ was $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$. Unfortunately, in this case all the localizations at prime ideals are integral domains, and they seem to be in every example I can think of. More generally, one could ask the question (since localizations are local rings), when is a reduced local ring an integral domain?

697600,Natural uses for the co-product of sets?,"I had come across countless uses of the (Cartesian) product of sets long before I first ever met the concept of a ""co-product"" 1 of sets.  In fact, anyone who has learned basic analytic geometry in high-school is already acquainted with at least one good example of a Cartesian product of sets. Does the concept of a co-product of sets have a useful life prior (or at least independent of) its role as obligatory example of elementary category theory? I'm looking for examples accessible to ""non-mathematicians"" (by which I really mean non-math-majoring undergraduates) in which the concept of a co-product of sets proves natural and useful (in the same way that, say, the product of two coordinate axes provides a natural and useful way to think about points on a plane). Epilogue The answers I received were very thought-provoking; thank you all! While thinking about MJD's and Martin Brandenburg's answers in particular my understanding of co-products of sets, and of their products for that matter, changed radically.  Now I've come to regard the co-product as a more natural and ubiquitous construct than the product 2 .  This is a complete reversal of how I saw them when I first posted my question.  I'd like put out these thoughts here, for whatever utility they may have for others, and whatever constructive criticism I may get. Since what follows is a bit long, here's the punchline: In $\def\Set{\mathbf{Set}}\Set$ , co-products are partitioned domains ; products are parametrized codomains. OK, here it goes.  After mulling over your answers, my thought now is that the standard description of the co-product in the $\Set$ category as "" the disjoint union"" makes it appear a lot more exotic than it is in reality.  Basically, the co-product arises whenever a domain is partitioned into subdomains : the partitioned domain is the co-product of these subdomains.  (The inclusion of the subdomains into the domain are, of course, the co-product's canonical inclusions.) This situation arises all the time .  Anyone who has been exposed to highschool math is familiar with piecewise definitions of functions, such as, for example, the standard definition of the absolute value function $|\cdot|:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ , $$
\left|x\right| = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    x, & \mathrm{if}\; x \ge 0\\
    -x, & \mathrm{if}\; x < 0
  \end{array}
\right.
$$ Such piecewise definitions amount to expressing the domain of a $\Set$ morphism (i.e. the function being defined) as the co-product of the domains of the ""pieces"" that the definition ""stitches together.""  In the example above, these stitched-together pieces are the $\Set$ morphisms $f_0:\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ and $f_1:\mathbb{R}_{< 0}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ defined by $$
\begin{array}{lr}
    f_0(x) = & x\\
    f_1(x) = & -x
\end{array}
$$ But such maneuvers are not limited to Mathematics.  Every procedure whose first stage is a ""channeling"" of the input into one of several mutually exclusive cases (e.g. ""whites"" and ""colors""), and associates a different sub-procedure with each case (e.g. ""wash in hot water"" and ""wash in lukewarm water""), to finally produce an output of ""a uniform kind"" (e.g., ""washed laundry""), is one that fits the description of the co-product in $\Set$ . I think that what makes it so easy to miss the ubiquity of the co-product in $\Set$ is that expressions such as $$X = \bigsqcup X_\alpha$$ tend to be interpreted as describing a synthetic operation, namely, one that starts with some arbitrary sets $X_\alpha$ , and combines them into "" their disjoint union"".  My point is that in practice such a maneuver is rare in comparison to the one that goes in the ""opposite direction"", namely, the analytic operation that starts with some set $X$ , and partitions it into subsets $X_\alpha$ . The unfortunate irony here is that it is precisely the needs of the in-practice-rare synthetic operation that necessitates introducing an exotic ""disjoint union"" operation (and even more exotic constructions of it, via ""tagged sets"" and the like), since arbitrary sets $\{X_\alpha\}$ cannot be assumed to be pairwise-disjoint. In contrast, the analytic operation, which is readily recognizable by anyone who has ever sorted out a bunch of items into separate classes, is one that does not require introducing any new set operation.  (At most, it requires to formally define a partition of a set $X$ as a cover of $X$ consisting of pairwise-disjoint subsets of $X$ .) In light of the above, I've come to realize that the term ""disjoint union"" could also be interpreted simply as shorthand for ""a union of disjoint (and covering) subsets"", instead of an exotic new set operation.  (There's precedent in Mathematics for transposing the adjective from the parts to the whole; for example an ""open cover"" is defined as a ""cover by open sets"".) Thinking of the co-product in $\Set$ as an manipulation on a domain also sharpened my appreciation of the product in $\Set$ as a manipulation on a codomain : whereas the co-product partitions a domain into subdomains, the product parametrizes a codomain by component sets.  With the co-product, several functions that have disjoint domains and the same codomain are stitched together.  With the product, several functions that have the same domain, and ""independent"" codomains are bound together into a single composite function. As MJD's answer alluded to, in programming the co-product manifests itself as ""switch"" statements, or, more generally, as sequences of if , else if ... else if , else expressions: function f(x):
    if test_1(x):
        return f_1(x)
    else if test_2(x):
        return f_2(x)
    ...
    else:
        return f_n(x)
    end
end Here, the domain $X$ of f is effectively partitioned into disjoint subsets $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ , where $X_i$ consists of all those elements of $X$ for which test_i is true, and test_j is false for every $j < i$ .  The function f ""stitches together"" the functions f_1 , ..., f_n , having (effective) domains $X_1, \dots, X_n$ , respectively.  This function f is the ""unique morphism"" in $\Set$ , for the given f_1 , ..., f_n , that is guaranteed by the definition of the co-product. 3 In contrast, the product manifests itself in programming most commonly whenever real-world entities are modeled as composites of a finite number of parameters in such a way that (1) any two model objects are considered identical if and only if their parameter values parameters all match, (2) any combination of allowable values for the parameters represents a valid model object 4 .  The simplest example of this would be modeling space as a collection of three parameters, x , y , and z .  Then, for example: function pos(t):
    return (pos_x(t), pos_y(t), pos_z(t)) The function pos ""bundles together"", the functions pos_x , pos_y , and pos_z .  It is the ""unique morphism"" in $\Set$ , for the given pos_x , pos_y , and pos_z , that is guaranteed by the definition of the product. Note that the function f given earlier is a function from the co-product (IOW the co-product serves as the domain), whereas the function pos given here is a function to the product (IOW, the product serves as the codomain).  This is characteristic. In short, the take-home message is: co-products are partitioned domains , products are parametrized codomains. Or better yet (as explained in footnote 2), sums are partitioned domains , cosums are parametrized codomains . 1 In the case of co-product I deliberately avoid the common practice of omitting the hyphen, as in cotangent , cohomology , cokernel , etc.  In natural language, juxtaposition is not associative (that's why, e.g., the components of the word unionized are parsed out differently by a chemist and a labor activist), and the non-standard, but plausibly intelligible, parsing ""copro-duct"" (literally: ""excrement conduit"") gives the unhyphenated version of the word a ... let's say, suspicious aura . 2 In fact, I now think that it's a bit unfortunate that learners of category theory are usually told about the co-product, and often summarily, only after being taught the product.  At least in $\Set$ , it would be more natural to begin with the co-product (or rather, with partitions, expressed as ""sums"" of disjoint subsets), and then introduce the product, or rather, the cosum!  Then the slogan given elsewhere could be restated a bit more memorably as: sums are partitioned domains, cosums are parametrized codomains . 3 Pedantic caveat: in order to interpret f as the morphism guaranteed by the definition of the co-product, the f_i must be construed as the restrictions of the implemented functions to their effective domains $X_i$ .  In practice, the domains of the implemented functions f_i will often be proper supersets of their effective domains $X_i$ .  Still, considering only its role in the implementation of f , the domain of each f_i is indeed $X_i$ . 4 Note that these two conditions correspond, respectively, to the existence and uniqueness conditions on the morphism that is guaranteed by the definition of a product.  Dually, the conditions on the subsets of a partition, namely (1) that they be pairwise-disjoint, and (2) that they cover the original set, correspond, respectively, to the existence and uniqueness conditions on the morphism that is guaranteed by the definition of a co-product.","['examples-counterexamples', 'education', 'elementary-set-theory', 'category-theory', 'soft-question']"

But now if we want to find a function of $\overline{Y}$ that is an unbiased estimator of $E(C)$, how would you go about that? I would think that you need to find $\hat{\theta}$, such that $E(\hat{\theta})=3\lambda + \lambda^2$, but I am a little confused as to whether or not that is accurate.

697643,Calculus on Manifolds - operational point of view,"I'm a student of Physics and I've been studying manifolds and calculus on such objects for a time.

This book brings interpretations of all the objects, like the vectors themselves, the integrals, the operations and so on and in the same time shows how one operates with them in practice. How to manipulate those objects and even carry down computations with them. Calculus on manifolds, on the other hand, is being a little more complicated. The reason is that all books I've found until now focus just on theorems and their proofs. There's nothing wrong with it, of course this is interesting as well, but what I really need is that operational view with interpretations and so on. For what I've seem until now, when doing calculus on manifolds one gets one incredible amount of work just to do some computations: work out charts, prove they are bijections and homeomorphism, prove they are $C^k$ related and so on. This also confuses me, because it seems much more complicated than vector calculus even to get started, while many people say it's not. So, where can I learn this operational point of view of calculus on manifolds? Meaning, learn to interpret objects like exterior derivatives, differential forms and their integrals, and in the same time learn how to in practice carry out operations with those objects?

Therefore I wanted to know which tactics there are to imagine the projective space. $$\mathbb{P^n}(k):= (k^{n+1}\backslash \{0\})/k^{*}$$ I like for example for the real projective space the idea of the sphere, but I am not sure if I got it right: $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{R})^2$ is the set of lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$ going through the origin. So if we put a Shere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ then each point in $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{R})^2$ is described by two antipodal points on the sphere. Then I saw that a parabola looks somehow like an ellipse on the sphere. (In the picture the red line. For the sake of lucidity I did not put the antipodal 'ellipse'.)

\boldsymbol{u}\text{ acts on }\mathcal{D}(0, T)\text{ through the pairing }\langle \boldsymbol{u}, \phi\rangle = \int_0^T \boldsymbol{u}(t)\phi(t)\, dt,\text{ where }\phi\in \mathcal{D}(0, T).$$ Note that the test function $\phi$ is scalar-valued. On the other hand, using definition (2) $$
\boldsymbol{u}\text{ acts on }\mathcal{D}(0, T; \mathbb{R}^n)\text{ through the pairing }\langle \boldsymbol{u}, \boldsymbol{\psi}\rangle = \int_0^T \boldsymbol{u}(t)\cdot \boldsymbol \psi(t)\, dt,\text{ where }\boldsymbol\psi\in \mathcal{D}(0, T; \mathbb{R}^n).$$ Here the test function is vector-valued and the pairing uses the dot product of $\mathbb{R}^n$ .

My doubt: Let set of open sets which cover $A \subset X$ be $\{U_1,U_2, U_3, \dots\}$. If we add $X$ in this collection of open sets, then also it would cover $A$ i.e. the new covering set be $\{X, U_1,U_2, U_3, \dots\}$.

698172,Maximum-Value Secretary Problem,"Background: The classic secretary problem has the simple solution of rejecting the first 1/e applicants and then selecting anyone who was better than the best in the rejected set.  However, in the real world secretaries are not of value 0 if they are not the best, and so choosing the 2nd best is normally far better than choosing the worst.  Also, if you stick to the classical approach, there's a 1/e chance that you will receive a random secretary from the set that excludes the best secretary. Real-World Example: Say that you've interviewed 98 out of 100 secretaries and have not found any better than secretary #32.  You then interview the 99th secretary and find that she is second only to #32. Analysis: Under the classical problem, you'd reject #99 as they have a value of 0 (not the best).  Thus, you'd take a random secretary in favor of the 98th or 99th best, depending on whether the last secretary is the best or not. However, the classical solution would not be the best decision in nearly all real-world cases, as you are taking a random applicant instead of one better than at least 97/99 others. Question: What is the proper stopping strategy to maximize the expected-value of the secretary you hire? You have n secretaries. Each secretary has a linear value assigned after each interview (a secretary ranked 4 is assumed to be twice as valuable as one ranked 2). The value-distribution of secretaries is unknown. You must accept or reject each secretary immediately following their interview with no recalls. You must maximize the expected value of the secretary you hire.","['probability', 'decision-theory']"

698184,A boolean algebra is complete if its stone space is extremally disconnected,"I have the following proof, but I don't understand one of the steps: Theorem 4.4. A Boolean algebra is complete iff its Stone space is exlremally disconnected. Proof. Identify the given Boolean algebra $B$ with the clopen algebra of $\mathsf{S}B$. Suppose that $B$ is complete, and let $U$ be an open set in $\mathsf{S}B$. Let $\mathscr{A}$ be the family of all members of $B$ included in $U$; then, since $B$ is a base for $\mathsf{S}B$, we have $U = \bigcup \mathscr{A}$. Since $B$ is complete, $\mathscr{A}$ has a supremum $V$ in $B$ which must by definition be a clopen subset of $\mathsf{S}B$. We claim that $\overline{U} = V$. 
  Since $V$ is an upper bound for $\mathscr{A}$, certainly $U = \bigcup \mathscr{A} \subseteq V$, so that $\overline{U} \subseteq V$ since $V$ is closed. If $V - \overline{U} \neq \emptyset$, then $V—\overline{U}$ is a non-empty open set which must, since $\mathsf{S}B$ is a Boolean space, include a non-empty clopen set $W$. But then $V-W$ is a clopen set which includes $\bigcup \mathscr{A}$ and is properly included in $V$. This contradicts the choice of $V$ as the supremum of $\mathscr{A}$. Therefore $\overline{U}=V$ as claimed, so a fortiori $V$ is open. Conversely, suppose that $\mathsf{S}B$ is extremaily disconnected, and let $\mathscr{A}$ be a subfamily of $B$. Then $U = \bigcup\mathscr{A}$ is an open subset of $\mathsf{S}B$ (recall that we are identifying $B$ with $\mathsf{CS}B$!) and so, since $\mathsf{S}B$ is extremally disconnected, $\overline{U}$ is clopen and hence in $B$. We claim that $\overline{U} = \bigvee \mathscr{A}$ in $B$. Certainly $\overline{U}$ is an upper bound for $\mathscr{A}$ in $B$; on the other hand, if $V$ is a member of $B$ which includes each member of $\mathscr{A}$, then $U = \bigcup \mathscr{A} \subseteq V$ so that $\overline{U} \subseteq V$ since $F$ is clopen. Therefore $\overline{U} = \bigvee \mathscr{A}$ as claimed, and $B$ is complete. $\blacksquare$ I do not understand the argument that why $V - \overline{U}$ is open set. and why should it include $W$ clopen set.","['general-topology', 'filters', 'boolean-algebra', 'compactness']"

Is there a classification of 3-transitive finite groups? Examples: For every non-negative integer $n$, $S_n$ and $A_n$ are 3-transitive on $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ If $n-1=p^f$ is a prime power, then all $G$ with $\operatorname{PGL}(2,p^f) \leq G \leq \operatorname{P\Gamma L}(2,p^f)$ are 3-transitive If $n-1=q^2$ is the square of a prime power, then also all $G$ with $M(q^2)\leq G \leq \operatorname{P\Gamma L}(2,p^f)$, where $\operatorname{PSL}(2,q^2) < M(q^2) < \operatorname{P\Gamma L}(2,q^2)$ Every sharply triply transitive group is either $\operatorname{PGL}(2,p^f)$ or $M(q^2)$, of order $((n-1)^2-1)((n-1)^2-(n-1))/(n-2) = n(n-1)(n-2)$. This is due to Zassenhaus; see Huppert–Blackburn (XI.1.4.b, XI.2.1, and XI.2.6). However, there are triply transitive groups that are not sharply triply transitive (such as $\operatorname{P\Gamma L}(2,p^f)$ for $f>1$). If $n$ is odd, then Wagner (1966) showed that any non-identity normal subgroup of a triply transitive group is also triply transitive. By taking a minimal normal subgroup (and then a minimal normal subgroup of that) we get a simple triply transitive group of the same degree, so if we are only interested in $n$, then we need only consult our knowledge of finite simple groups. I think $\operatorname{ASL}(n,2)$ is always triply transitive. Here are the triply transitive groups of degree $n < 2500$ that don't fall into the above categories: $M_{11}$ of degree 11 $M_{11}$ of degree 12, $M_{12}$ of degree 12 $A_7 \ltimes 2^4$ of degree 16 (?) $M_{22}, \operatorname{Aut}(M_{22})$ of degree 22 $M_{23}$ of degree 23 $M_{24}$ of degree 24 Note these are mostly Mathieu groups.

698348,Determining the probability of unique values chosen from a larger set?,"I'm trying to solve what I think is a more generalized version of the ""birthday paradox"".  I run into problems like this all the time and I can never quite figure out how to tackle them. Suppose I have a set of $M$ possibilities all with an equal probability of being chosen: $\operatorname{P}(M_n) = 1/M$.  Now suppose I pick from the set of possibilities $N$ times.  I'd like to know the probability of there being $C$ unique values chosen.  I'd also like to know the probability of the tails. This strikes me as related to the Birthday paradox. To make the problem more concrete, I'm currently trying to figure out how unexpected an event is.  I have $156$ salts chosen where each salt is a $12\mathrm{-bit}$ number.  Only $147$ salts were unique.  That is, $9$ of them are duplicates.  So $M = 2^{12} = 4096$ and $N = 156$.  I'd like to calculate the probability that there were exactly $147$ unique salts chosen.  I'd also like to be able to compute the probably of at least $147$ and at most $147$. Is there a probability distribution for this?  Maybe something like the Poisson distribution?","['probability-distributions', 'discrete-mathematics', 'probability']"

I would really appreciate if someone finds a proof with basic Euclidean Geometry. I would call a class of Convex Geometric figure (upto Homothety) on $\mathbb{R}^2$, $k$-determined if exactly $k$ points are required to determine the figure uniquely. For example a circle is $3$-determined, one needs exactly $3$ points on the plane to determine a circle uniquely. An ellipse is $4$-determined. From here I would like to ask the following question : If a collection $S$ of $n$ points on $\mathbb{R}^2$, has the property that every sub-collection $T_i=\{P_{i_1},\ldots,P_{i_k}\}$ of $k$ points of $S$ has the property that there is a $k+1^{th}$ point, $P_i \in S\setminus T_i$ (distinct from the sub-collection $T_i$) that lies on the $k$-determined convex figure, determined by $T_i$, then  does it follow that all points of $S$ lie on the $k$-determined convex figure?

Maybe you can help to see where I went wrong. I have computed the tangent plane as $z = 0$.  So first take a vector $(0,1,0)= e_1$, corresponding to the $x=0$ part (so that $z = y^2$).  Now, define a map $\gamma(s) = (0,s,s^2)$.  Then, $\gamma : (-\epsilon,\epsilon) \rightarrow M$ and this satisfies $\gamma(0) = (0,0,0) = p$ and also $\gamma'(0) = (0,1,0) = e_1$. Now, the first curvature should be the eigenvalue of the Weingarten map $L$.  That is by definition $$L(e_1) = -\frac{d}{ds}n(\gamma(s))|_{s=0}$$  But $$n(\gamma(s)) = \frac{\gamma(s)}{|\gamma(s)|} = \frac{(0,s,s^2)}{\sqrt{s^2+s^4}}$$ When I take the derivative and evaluate at $s= 0$, I get $(0,0,1)$, which is not a multiple of $e_1$.

I'm going to be honest I saw this answer but I don't quite understand it. I am familiar with the propositions that I am given but not sure how its applied. Proposition 2: If $f: U \subset R^3 \rightarrow R $ is a differentiable function and $a \in f(U)$ is a regular value of $f$, then $f^{-1}(a)$ is a regular surface in $R^3$. Proof:Define this function $f(x,y,z)= x^2+y^2+z^2-1$. Then the cylinder is the set $f^{-1}(0)$. Computing all partial derivatives, this result is obtained. $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=2x, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=2y, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}=2z.$ It is clear that all partial derivatives are zero if and only if x=y=z=0  or $(0,0,0)$. Further checking shows that $f(0,0,0) \neq 0$, which means that $(0,0,0)$ does not belong to $f^{-1}(0)$. Hence for all $u \in f^{-1}(0)$, not all of partial derivatives at $u$ are zero. By proposition 2, the cylinder hence is regular surface. Futhermore the cylinder can be parameterized as $g(u,v)=(cos u, sinu,v)$ where $u,v \in \mathbb{R}$ Okay so I'm not sure why we define the function as $f(x,y,z)= x^2+y^2+z^2-1$; is it because we are told it is in $R^3$ so we have to include $z$?
