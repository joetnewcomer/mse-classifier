660069,Confusion about a way to compute a residue at a pole,"Suppose I have a function of the form $$f(x)=\frac{1}{(x-a)(x-b)^2(x-c)^3}$$ Clearly, I have a simple pole at $a$, and poles of order 2,3 at $b,c$, respectively. 
By definition, the residue at $x=\alpha$ is the coeffecient of the term $(x-\alpha)^{-1}$ in the Laurent expansion of $f(x)$ centered at $x=\alpha$. From my experience, this residue at $x=\alpha$ is equivalent to the coefficient of the term $(x-\alpha)^{-1}$ in the partial fraction decomposition of $f(x)$. However, the partial fraction of $f(x)$ will not be a Laurent series since it has no center (I.e., there are denominators of the form $x-\beta$ with $\beta \not = \alpha$). Is there a rule that says that the coefficient of $(x-\alpha)^{-1}$ in the partial fraction decompositon is the residue at $x=\alpha$, even if the partial fraction decompoition is not a Laurent expansion?","['residue-calculus', 'complex-analysis']"

$$y^2 = (x-e_1)(x-e_2)(x-e_3)$$ I want to compute this straight from the definitions instead of using any theorem. My first step was to find a uniformizer. For that, I computed $$\mathfrak m_{[0:1:0]}/\mathfrak m^2_{[0:1:0]} = (x,z)/(x^2,xz,z^2)$$ From homogenizing the equation of the elliptic curve and expanding the left hand side, one sees that $zy^2= x^3 +... \in \mathfrak m^2_{[0:1:0]}$. Since $y^2$ doesn't vanish at $P=[0:1:0]$, it is a unit in the local ring $C_P$. Hence $z\in \mathfrak m^2_{[0:1:0]}$ and $x$ is a uniformizer, which we name '$t$'.

660617,representation theorem on the path space,"I'm working on a project and have done some work. However, there are some point where I'm unsure if my thoughts are correct. It would be appreciated if someone could share their thoughts about it. Let $K\in\mathbb{N}$ and let $\Omega:=\mathbb{R}_+^K$. A general element $\omega\in \Omega$ is of the form $\omega=(\omega_1,\dots,\omega_K)$. Let $X:\Omega\to\Omega$ be the canonical process given by $X_k(\omega)=\omega_k$ and let $\mathcal{F}_k:=\sigma(X_1,\dots,X_k)$. We are given a sequence of probability measures $P_n$ on $\Omega$ which converges weakly to $P$. Thus, by the Skorohod representation theorem there are $\Omega$-valued r.v. $(Y_n)$ and $Y_n$ on a probability space $(\Omega_2,\mathcal{F},Q)$  such that $Y_n\to Y$ for every $\omega\in\Omega_2$ and $P_n=(Y_n)_*(Q)$ the law of $Y_n$ is $P_n$ $P=(Y)_*(Q)$ the law of $Y$ is $P$ Now let $f$ be a fixed function and $(f_n)$ be a sequence of function with $f,f_n:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f_n\to f$ pointwise. For the rest, $f$ and $(f_n)$ is fixed. Thus we have $$E_P[f(X)]=\int_{\Omega}f(X(\omega))P(d\omega)=\int_{\Omega_2}f(X(Y(\omega')))Q(d\omega')=E_Q[f(X(Y))]$$ and in fact, since $X$ is the identity on $\Omega$, we have $$E_P[f(X)]=E_Q[f(Y)]\tag{1}$$
in the same way we have $$E_{P_n}[f_n(X)]=E_Q[f_n(Y_n)].\tag{2}$$ Question 1 Is my observation in $(1)$ and therefore $(2)$ correct? My goal is to establish the following equality $$E_P[f(X)]=\lim_nE_{P_n}E[f_n(X)]$$ We assume that $f(\omega)=\lim_nf_n(\omega_n)$ for all $\omega_n\to \omega$. Thus we have $$E_Q[f(Y)]=E_Q[\lim_nf_n(Y_n)]=E_{P_n}[\lim_nf_n(X)] \tag{3}.$$ Question 2 Is my observation in $(3)$ correct? Now if we can interchange limit and expectation we are done. So we need some further assumptions. 
If we assume that there is function $g$ such that for all $n$ we have the following: $$E_{P_n}[g(X)] <\infty$$ and $$|f_n(X)|\le g(X).$$ Note this is just a (random) integration condition. Thus we can use the dominated convergence to obtain $$E_{P_n}[\lim_nf_n(X)]=\lim_n E_{P_n}[f_n(X)] \tag{4}.$$ Question 3 Is my observation in $(4)$ correct?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"

Hence by the Cauchy-Riemann equations I find that $\operatorname{Im} (f(z)) \equiv c$, where $c$ is a constant. If I could deduce that $c=0$, $f$ would only take real values on the real axis, I could use the Schwarz reflection principle to extend $f$ to a bounded holomorphic function on $\mathbb{C}$, which is, by Liouville, constant.

There exists $n\in \Bbb{N}$ such that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}{|a_{n+i}|^p}<\epsilon/2$. Now take the sequence $\{r_1,r_2,\dots,r_n,0,0,\dots\}$, where $r_1,r_2,\dots,r_n\in\Bbb{Q}$ and $\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}{|a_{j}-r_j|^p}<\epsilon/2$.

660826,Game of polynomials,"Written on a blackboard is the polynomial: $$x^2+x+2014$$ Calvin and Peter take turns alternately in the following game: During his turn, Calvin must either increase or decrease the coefficient of $x$ by $1$ .  (Calvin's turn comes first.) Then, for Peter's turn, he must either increase or decrease the constant coefficient by $1$ . Calvin wins if at any point the polynomial currently written on the blackboard has integer roots (regardless of whose turn it is at that time.) Prove that Calvin has a winning strategy. I came across this problem today in INMO (Indian National Mathematical Olympiad). I considered the three cases that Peter either continuously decreases, continuously increases, or keeps the constant term in the vicinity of 2014 by alternatively increasing and decreasing the constant term. If he decreases, then eventually the constant term equals zero and we get integer roots. If he increases to a max of $t$ units after $t$ turns, then so does Calvin, and we get the polynomial $x^2+tx+2014+t$ .  Setting its discriminant greater than zero gives us the range of $t$ for which real solutions are obtained.  After that, clearly we will get some integer $t+n$ such that the root is an integer, as the numerator only has to be an even number for this to happen. The third case follows trivially as a subset of the second case. Is my approach valid?  Are there other approaches?","['algebra-precalculus', 'roots', 'contest-math', 'polynomials']"

660943,Projective closure of an algebraic curve as a compactification of Riemann surface,"Assume $f \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]$ a polynomial such that the affine algebraic curve $X=V(f)$ has no singular points. Then there is a natural structure of non-compact Riemann surface on $X$, which can be made into compact Riemann surface by adding several (finitely many) points. Question: Is this compactification the same thing as taking projective closure of the curve $X$? If so, how does one generally define the holomorphic maps in the neighborhoods of the ""points at infinity""? Up until now I have thought so. However, I came across the following example (I will further assume that the projective closure is indeed the compactification): Consider a polynomial $$f(x,y)=x^ 2-g(y), $$ where $g(y)$ is a complex polynomial of an even degree $k, \; k>2$ and, for simplicity's sake, leading coefficient $1$. Assume further that $g$ has $k$ distinct roots. Say I want to compute the genus of the compactification of $V(f)$. Then the projective closure of $V(f)$ is $V_{proj}(f^{*}),$ where $$f^{*}(x,y,z)=x^2z^{k-2}-y^k-(\text{other monomials of }g\text{ multiplied by some nonzero power of }z)$$ Now I want to compute the points at infinity, this leads to the equation
$y^k=0,$ hence $y=0$ and thus, there is only one such point: $(1:0:0)$. However, consider the holomorphic map $\pi: V_{proj}(f^*) \rightarrow \mathbb{S}$ defined by $\pi(x:y:1)=y, \pi(1:0:0)=\infty$. Then it is easy to compute that the degree of $\pi$ is $2$ and that $b(\pi)=k+1$ (where 
$b(\pi):= \sum_{P \in V_{proj}(f^*)}(e_P-1)$ and $e_P$ denotes the ramification index at the point $P$). So by Riemann-Hurwitz formula I get $$g(V_{proj}(f^*))=1+(g(\mathbb{S})-1)\deg \pi +\frac{1}{2}b(\pi)=\frac{k+1}{2}-1,$$ which is not an integer. (Note that if tha considered curve had two points at infinity, the number $b(\pi)$ would be even and everything would work fine). So additional question is: If the compactification can really be obtained via the projective closure, where is the mistake in the previous example?

My try: I can see there are branch cuts here. For the log term I can choose a branch cut along the negative real axis, uncluding the origin, and for the $\text{Arg}$ function I can choose the line from $i$ to $-i$. None of these branch cuts seems to affect my chosen contour, so no worries there (so long as I'm right about my branch cuts that is) Substituting $z=1+Re^{i\theta}$ for $\gamma_2$ gives $$-\int_0^\infty\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}\log(1+R^2e^{i2\theta})\right)\cosh\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{R\sin\theta}{1+R\cos\theta}\right)\right)\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{R\sin\theta}{1+R\cos\theta}\right)e^{isRe^{i\theta}}iRe^{i\theta}d\theta,$$ and taking the limit as $R\to\infty$ gives zero (according to Mathematica) The integral along $\gamma_3$ is zero since the argument of a real number is zero. Hence, we get $$I= \int_1^{1+i\infty}\cos(\log|z|)\cosh(\text{Arg}z)\text{Arg}(z)e^{is(z-1)}dz + 0 + 0 = \sum_{\text{residues}},$$ and since there are no poles then the integral is equal to zero. But! Looking closer at this integral, using the substitution $z=1+iy$, we get $$I=i\int_0^\infty\cos\left(\log\sqrt{1+y^2}\right)\cosh(\tan^{-1} y)\tan^{-1}(y)e^{-sy}dy.$$ If we substitute some real values for $s$, numerical integration shows this integral is definitely not $0$.

Please note that I prefer hints over full answers, because that way I get to understand it lot better, but full answers are also acceptable. Thanks in forward. * EDIT(ANSWER): * * Ok so proof goes like this from fact that f(x)=0 we can prove that $c_0$ is zero.Here is how we do that:
Since $ f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n} c_kx^n $ it implies that for some $ n \ge 1$ it holds $f(0) = c_0x^0 + c_1x^1 + c_2x^2+...+c_nx^n $
Since we have $x^0$ and $x=0$ then we can conclude that $x^0$ = 1 thus we thus the first term in expansion becomes $c_0 \times 1 $ .For now we know that all terms except first term in expansion are zero because 0 to any power is zero,and $c_k \times 0 =0$ always. Now we are left with $ f(0) = c_0 \times 1 = 0 $ from which we easily conclude that that $c_0 = 0$ Next since g(x) is polynomial of degree n-1 we can write it in following manner $ g(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_kx^{k-1} = c_0x^{-1} + c_1 + c_2x + ... + c_nx^{n-1} $ Now we can come to real business which is: $ f(x) = xg(x) $ $ \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_kx^k = x\sum_{k=0}^{n} c_kx^{k-1}$ $ c_0x^0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + ... + c_nx^n = x(c_0x^{-1} + c_1x^0 + c^2x^1 + ... + c_nx^{n-1} ) $ since we have concluded that c_0 = 0 then we can write: $ c_1x + c_2x^2 + ... + c_nx^n = x(c_1x^0 + c_2x^1 + ... + c_nx^{n-1} )$ $ c_1x + c_2x^2 + ... + c_nx^n = c_1x^1 + c_2x^2 + ... + c_nx^n $ and thus it is proven.","['calculus', 'functions', 'polynomials']"

Here is how I did the problem: By part (a), we have that $\displaystyle \abs{u(x)-\overline{u}_{\Omega}}\leq \frac{(\diam \Omega)^{n}}{n\abs{\Omega}}\int_{\Omega}\frac{\abs{Du(y)}}{\abs{x-y}^{n-1}}dy$, so we have the relationship required in part (b) between $\tilde{u}(x) = u(x)-\overline{u}_{\Omega}$ and $v(y)$, with kernel $K(x,y) = \frac{1}{\abs{x-y}^{n-1}}$ and $\displaystyle \abs{v(y)} = \frac{(\diam \Omega)^{n}}{n\abs{\Omega}}\abs{Du(y)}$. Therefore, applying part (b), we obtain that $$\begin{align}
\norm{\tilde{u}}_{L^{q}(\Omega)}
&= \norm{u(x) - \overline{u}_{\Omega}}_{L^{q}(\Omega)}\\
&\leq A \norm{v}_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
= A\left( \int_{\Omega}\abs{v(y)}^{p} dy\right)^{1/p} \\
&= A \left( \int \left\lvert \frac{(\diam \Omega)^{n}}{n\abs\Omega}Du(y)\right\rvert^{p}dy\right)^{1/p} \\
&= A \frac{(\diam \Omega)^{n}}{n\abs\Omega}\left( \int |Du(y)|^{p}dy\right)^{1/p} \\
&= A \frac{(\diam \Omega)^{n}}{n\abs\Omega}\norm{Du}_{L^{P}(\Omega)}.
\end{align}$$ Now, since by part (b), we are told that $$A = \max\left(\sup_{x}\norm{K(x,\cdot)}_{L^{\frac{pq}{pq+p-q}}}, \sup_{y}\norm{K(\cdot,y)}_{L^{\frac{pq}{pq+p-q}}}\right),$$ we must show that $$\displaystyle \sup_{x}\norm{K(x,\cdot)}_{L^{\frac{pq}{pq+p-q}}(\Omega)} \leq C_{n}\left[ \frac{1+\frac{1}{q} - \frac{1}{p}}{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p}} \right]^{1 + \frac{1}{q} - \frac{1}{p}}\abs\Omega^{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p}},$$ which I did.  I'll spare you the gory details of this derivation, especially since it's not relevant to my question. My question comes in the putting of it all together : When we do put it all together, we have that $$\begin{align}
\norm{u-\overline{u}_{\Omega}}_{L^{q}(\Omega)}
&\leq A \norm v_{L^{p}(\Omega)} \\
&= A \frac{(\diam \Omega)^{n}}{n\abs\Omega}\left( \int_{\Omega} \abs{Du(y)}^{p}dy \right)^{1/p} \\
&\leq c_{n} \left[ \frac{1+\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p}}{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p}} \right]^{1+\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p}}\abs\Omega^{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{q} - \frac{1}{p}}\frac{(\diam \Omega)^{n}}{n\abs\Omega} \norm{Du}_{L^{p}(\Omega)}
\end{align}$$ and eventually, we get the desired result. From this point on, I was able to get the desired result just fine; however, my question is, in the last line of this last quoted formula, should I have a $\mathbf{\leq}$ sign as it is currently written, or should it be an $=$ sign, and why ?

Show that $L^{p}(X, \chi, \mu)$ is isomorphic to $L^{p}(X, \overline{\chi}, \mu)$ using the obvious candidate for the isomorphism. Be- cause of this, when dealing with Lp spaces, we will usually not be too concerned with whether the underlying measure space is complete. Actually I think this is obvious; but my answer is this. Let $\phi: L^{p}(X, \chi, \mu) \to L^{p}(X, \overline{\chi}, \mu)$ as $f \mapsto f$.Since $\overline{\chi}$ is topology adding $\sigma-algebra$ of $\mu-$measurable zero set, $f \in L^{p}(X, \chi, \mu)$ is also absolutely integrable on $(X, \overline{\chi}, \mu)$. Edited part start For showing subjectivity, think about nonempty measurable set $E \in \overline{\chi}$. Then $E$ has $E_{1}, E_{2} \in \chi$ such that $E_{1} \subseteq E_{2} \subseteq E$ and $\overline{\mu}(E_{1}\setminus E_{2}) = 0$ and $\overline{\mu}(E) = \mu(E_{1}) = \mu(E_2)$. Hence for any $\overline{\mu}$ measurable $f = \sum_{i\in A}a_{n}1_{\overline{E_{i}}}$, construct $g = \sum_{i\in A}a_{n}1_{E_{i}}$ where $\overline{E_{i}} \in \overline{\chi}$, $E_{i} \in \chi$ and $\overline{\mu}(\overline{E_{i}}) = \mu(E_i)$.

661595,"Why is Lebesgue-Stieltjes a generalization of Riemann-Stieltjes? Moreover, is there an example where Lebesgue-Stieltjes is useful","I certainly have a question, but i don't know what the best title should be. Please edit the title if there is a better one :) And I believe, to get a better answer, it would be good to explain exactly what i feel and know.. ======== Riemann-Stieltjes Integral (Darboux Sum) can be defined for bounded integrand $f$ and nondecreasing $\alpha$ . ( $\alpha$ does not need to be continuous ). However, as far as i know, Lebesgue-Stieltjes Integral requires integrator to be right or left continuous. Moreover, even if there is a way to define measure associated to nondecreasing discontinuous function, integral w.r.t to this function cannot be identical to that of Riemann-Stieltjes. (I'll explain it below) Below is the result i have proved: Theorem Let $\alpha:\mathbb{R}$ be a monotonically increasing right-continuous function. Let $f:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a RS-integrable function w.r.t $\alpha$ on $[a,b]$ . Let $\mu_\alpha$ be the LS-measure w.r.t $\alpha$ . Then, there exists $F\in L^1(\mu_\alpha)$ such that $\forall x\in(a,b], F(x)=f(x)$ and $\int_a^b f d\alpha = \int_{(a,b]} F d\mu_\alpha$ Since when one wants to use RS-integration, one's interest is exactly in $[a,b]$ . So rather than using full domain of $\alpha$ as illustrated in the above theorem, we can replace it by $\alpha(x)=\alpha(a)$ for $x<a$ . Then, this new $\alpha$ is continuous at $a$ . Thus $\int_a^b f d\alpha = \int_{[a,b]} F d\mu_\alpha$ . Hence, in the case $\alpha$ is right continuous, it can be understood that LS-integration is an extension of RS-integration. However, in general, if $\alpha$ is not right or left continuous, LS-integration cannot be a generalization of RS-integration. Let $\alpha$ be a nondecreasing function. Suppose there exists a measure $\mu$ such that for some type of interval $【a,b】$ , $\mu(【a,b】)=\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)$ . (【a,b】denotes one of open,closed,half-open and whatsoever that has an interval form.) Then, the continuity of $\mu$ shows that the only choice that $\mu$ could be a measure is that $\mu((a,b))=\alpha(b-)-\alpha(a+)$ . Indeed, we can construct such measure. Define $F(x)=\alpha(x+)$ . Then $F$ is right-continuous nondecreasing function and the LS-measure $\mu$ associated with $F$ is the measure such that $\mu((a,b))=\alpha(b-) - \alpha(a+)$ . In this case, RS-integral and LS-integral of a bounded function do not coincide in general. When $\alpha$ is continuous, LS seems more natural than RS to me. However, when $\alpha$ is not continuous, LS does not seem natural at all to me.. I'm an undergraduate, so i don't know many cases where integration is useful. I don't have any clue why one should know LS integration. Is there any natural-science example of a function that is only LS integrable but not RS integrable? Or is there any mathematical example that LS integration is useful? I understand how Lebesgue Integration flows better than Riemann Integration, but I don't see any reason why LS-integration is in need.","['integration', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral', 'lebesgue-measure']"
661606,How to solve this ODE: $\dfrac{\dot{y}}{\sqrt{1+\dot{y}^2}}=c$?,"Suppose $\dot{y}$ is the derivative of y with respect to x, i.e. $\dot{y} \equiv 
\dfrac{dy}{dx}$. And here comes the question: How to solve the following ODE? $$\dfrac{\dot{y}}{\sqrt{1+\dot{y}^2}}=c$$Where c is constant. I used Mathematica 9.0 to give the answer $y=\pm\dfrac{cx}{\sqrt{1-c^2}}+b(or\,a)$ where a, b are constants. But I want to know how to solve it?

661610,Show that a group with $|G| = 33$ contains an element of order $3$,"Show that a group with $|G| = 33$ contains an element of order $3$. Using Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders are $1$,$3$,$11$, and $33$ (from the factors of $33$). If there is a subgroup containing an element with an order of $33$, then we are done. There is only one identity element with an order of $1$. I am currently left with elements of orders $3$ or $11$. What is the best way to show that any element of order $11$ is a contradiction?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
661611,Sequence where the sum of digits of all numbers is 7,"BdMO 2014 We define a sequence starting with $a_1=7,a_2=16,\ldots,\,$ such that the sum of digits of all numbers of the sequence is $7$ and if $m>n$,then $a_m>a_n$ i.e. all such  numbers are arranged in ascending order. If $a_k=2014$, find $a_{\frac{k}{2}+3}$. Let us call the numbers of the sequence 'good'.Then there are 1 one-digit good number,7 two-digit good numbers, 28 three-digit good numbers,and (28 four digit good numbers that start with 1). Total$=64$. Then 2014 is the 66th number.Therefore we want $a_{36}$. We note that there are 36 good numbers from 1 to 999. So the 36th good number is the largest 3 digit good number, i.e. 700. Is there a better way?The above method clearly is a practical way of doing it,but is there a smarter way?","['sequences-and-series', 'contest-math', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'combinatorics']"
661612,"Finding $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac {a\sin bx -b\sin ax}{x^2 \sin ax}$ witouth L'Hopital, what is my mistake?","I was working on this question. $\lim_{x \to 0} \dfrac {a\sin bx -b\sin ax}{x^2 \sin ax}$ $\lim_{x \to 0} \dfrac {1}{x^2} \cdot \lim_{x \to 0} \dfrac { \frac {1}{abx}}{\frac {1}{abx}} \cdot \dfrac {a\sin bx -b\sin ax}{\sin ax}$ $\lim_{x \to 0} \dfrac {1}{x^2} \cdot \dfrac {\lim_{x \to 0} \frac {\sin bx}{bx}- \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{\sin ax}{ax}}{\frac 1b \lim_{x \to 0} \frac {\sin ax}{ax}}$ $b \lim_{x \to 0} \dfrac {1}{x^2} \cdot \dfrac {b-a}{a}$ It seems like this limit does not exist, but if you apply L'Hopital's rule you seem to get an answer.

661615,What's a good class of functions for bounding/comparing ratios of complicated logarithms?,"I have this goofy series $\sum \limits_{n=2}^\infty \frac{ \log_2 \left[ n \log_2^2 n \right]}{n \log_2^2 n}$ that Wolfram Alpha tells me diverges by the comparison test (and indeed, in the larger problem I'm working on I need to prove that the expression containing it diverges), but I'm struggling to find a good divergent lower bound. I can't just throw away all the inner logarithms--then I run into the theorem $\lim \limits_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\log_a x}{x^b} \rightarrow 0 \;\forall b > 0$. So I'm looking at things like $\frac{\log_2 \left[ n^3 \right]}{n \log_2^2 n}$ (larger, unfortunately), $\frac{\log_2 \left[ n^3 \right]}{n^2 \log_2 n}$ (converges), and $\frac{\log_2 \left[ n^2 \right]}{n \log_2^2 n}$ (still too large). Is there a more general class or form I can use to find a simple divergent lower bound, instead of stabbing in the dark?","['divergent-series', 'logarithms', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"
