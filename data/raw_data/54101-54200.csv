577016,Set of generators of the commutator subgroup of a surface group,"Good morning, I am having a hard time trying to describe the commutator subgroup of a surface group. Namely, if $S$ is a compact orientable surface and $G$ its fundamental subgroup, let's recall that $G$ is given by the following presentation $ \langle a_1, b_1, ..., a_g, b_g \ | \ \prod_{1\leq i \leq g}{[a_i,bi]} =1 \rangle$. Its commutator subgroup is an infinite rank free group. Can one give a set of generator of this subgroup ? Or even better, could one make such a set free ? I would be grateful for any hint or reference ! Selim","['algebraic-topology', 'low-dimensional-topology', 'group-theory']"
577036,If $\sum a_nb_n$ converges for each null sequence $(b_n)$ then $\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent,"A friend of mine gave me the following problem recently: Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence of real numbers. Suppose that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nb_n$ converges for any sequence $(b_n)$ such that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} b_n=0$. Show that $\sum |a_n|<\infty$. Hint he gave me was to use Banach-Steinhaus theorem (a.k.a. uniform boundedness principle). I would like to know whether there are different solutions to this, in particular, whether there is an elementary solution. (Using just calculus, without resorting to more advanced results from functional analysis or other areas.) The argument using Banach-Steinhaus theorem goes as follows: Let $a=(a_n)$ be a given (fixed) sequence such that $\sum a_nb_n$ converges for each $b=(b_n)\in c_0$. For every $n$ we can define $f_n\colon c_0\to{\mathbb R}$ as $\sum_{k=1}^n a_nb_n$. We consider $c_0$ with the usual sup-norm, which makes $c_0$ into a Banach space. Each function $f_n$ is obviously linear. For any $b\in c_0$ such that $\|b\|=\sup\limits_{n\in\mathbb N} |b_n| \le 1$ we have
$$|f_n(b)| \le \sum_{k=0}^n |a_k|.$$
This shows that all functions $f_n$ are bounded linear functionals. Now if we fix some $b=(b_k)\in c_0$ we have
$$\left|\sum_{k=0}^n a_kb_k\right| \le \sum_{k=0}^\infty |a_k|\cdot |b_k|.$$
The sum on the RHS is finite, since it can be expressed as $\sum a_kc_k$, where $c_k=\pm b_k$. (The choice of sign here depends on the signs of $b_k$ and $a_k$.) So we have shown that at each point $b\in c_0$ the values $f_n(b)$ are bounded by the same constant (depending only on $b$). By Banach-Steinhaus theorem we have that there exists a constant $M$ such that $\|f_n\|<M$ for each $n\in\mathbb N$. Now it only remains to show that $\|f_n\|=\sum_{k=0}^n |a_k|$. We already know that $\|f_n\|\le\sum_{k=0}^n |a_k|$. The other inequality can be obtained by choosing $b$ in unit ball, such that $b_k$ is either $1$ or $-1$, depending on the sign of $a_k$ for $k=1,2,\dots,n$; and $b_k=0$ for $k>n$. Now we have that $\sum_{k=0}^n |a_k|<M$ for each $n$, which implies $\sum_{k=0}^n |a_k|\le M$.",['sequences-and-series']

577060,"On the powerset of a monoid, does the second operation play nice with the first? Indeed, is it even useful?","Let $X$ denote a monoid. Then we can make $Y = \mathcal{P}(X)$ into a monoid, too. Define $$AB = \{ab \mid a \in A, b \in B\}$$ for all $A,B \in Y.$ We see immediately that $1$ (shorthand for $\{1\}$) is our new identity: $$A1 = A, \;\; 1B = B.$$ In fact, $Y$ becomes an ordered monoid by defining that $A \leq B$ is notation for $A \subseteq B$. It follows that: $A \leq B \rightarrow AC \leq BC$ $A \leq B \rightarrow CA \leq CB$ Furthermore, $Y$ is a complete atomistic Boolean algebra, and we have compatibility of composition with joins: $A \left(\bigvee_{i \in I} B_i\right) = \bigvee_{i \in I} AB_i$ $\left(\bigvee_{i \in I} A_i\right) B = \bigvee_{i \in I} A_i B$ Now most authors would probably stop there. And perhaps that is the right thing to do. But, for the sake of experimentation, lets go a step further. Define another monoid structure on $Y$ by writing $$A*B = (A^cB^c)^c.$$ Question. Does this new operation ""play nice with"" the earlier-defined operation in some sense? Indeed, is the $*$ operation in any way useful? Discussion . We see that $*$ is associative, and that $1^c$ is its identity $$A * 1^c = A, \;\; 1^c * B = B.$$ We also have the following. $A \leq B \rightarrow A*C \leq B*C$ $A \leq B \rightarrow C*A \leq C*B$ $A * \left(\bigwedge_{i \in I} B_i\right) = \bigwedge_{i \in I} (A*B_i)$ $\left(\bigwedge_{i \in I} A_i\right) * B = \bigwedge_{i \in I} (A_i * B).$ Remark. We can do something similar with the binary relations on a set. Given binary relations $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on a set $S$, define $$\alpha\beta = \{(x,y) \in S^2 \mid \exists s \in S : (x,s) \in \alpha \wedge (s,y) \in \beta\}$$ $$\alpha * \beta = \{(x,y) \in S^2 \mid \forall s \in S : (x,s) \in \alpha \vee (s,y) \in beta\}.$$ This makes $\mathcal{P}(S^2)$ into an ordered monoid in two distinct ways. In the first way, the diagonal relation is the identity. In the second, its complement is the identity. All the expected interactions with order-theoretic concepts hold. Actually, we can go further. In particular, the class of all sets can be made into a category whose morphisms are binary relations. However, this can be done in two different ways, corresponding to two different laws of  composition. Once again, all the expected interactions with order-theoretic concepts hold.","['soft-question', 'semigroups', 'abstract-algebra', 'monoid']"
577068,"Cardinality of $\{ f\in C'[0,1] : f(0)=0, f(1)=1, |f'(t)|\leq 1 \forall t\in[0,1]\}$...

I have not yet used $|f'(t)|\leq 1 \forall t\in[0,1]$ but i belive this would also give same result. Just for simplicity Suppose $f(x)=x^3$ then, $|f'(t)|=\frac{|f(x)-f(y)|}{|x-y|}=\frac{|x^3-y^3|}{|x-y|}=|x^2+xy+y^2|$ But i can choose $x,y$ accordingly suhc that this is not bounded by $1$ So, $f(x)$ do not have higher powers and because $f(1)=1$, coefficient of $x$ has to be $1$ i.e., $$A=\{ f\in C'[0,1] : f(0)=0, f(1)=1, |f'(t)|\leq 1 \forall t\in[0,1]\}=\{x\}$$ I would like some one to verify if this is sufficient or do i have to rewrite the arguments (I am sure i have to, but i am not sure how to do so).

577122,Confusion with definition of a manifold.,"I'm reading some notes about integration of differential forms and at the begining the author claims: A $1$-manifold in $n$ dimensions is just a curve parametrized as $X: (a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ (Me: plus other conditions of smoothness, etc.). In general a $k$-manifold in $n$ dimensions is just the image of a function $X: D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ (Me: with the aditional conditions). My questions are: $(1)$ how can you come to such description of a manifold from the definiton of manifolds by charts, atlases and transition maps, and $(2)$ by the definiton I know, a manifold $M$ is of dimension $n$ (and is called a $n$-manifold) if for some chart (and hence for all) $(U \subseteq M, \phi)$, $\phi (U) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$.

The solution is trivial for odd $n$: The diagonal can always be used as rooks will never threaten each other along a diagonal and all integers $[0, n)$ will be generated as the next entry's label after $(i, j)$ in the diagonal is $i+1+j+1 = i+j+2 \mod n$, and going up to $2\mod n$, for odd $n$, will generate all numbers (staring from $i = j = 0$). For all even $n$, though, the diagonal is definitely not possible. Is there another solution, though? I do not think so, and manually attempting to generate one on an even board always seems to fail. I'm finding it quite difficult to prove it is impossible, though. Help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!","['modular-arithmetic', 'combinatorics']"

If all coordinates of $x$ are different from $0$ in a certain base $(e_1,...,e_n)$, then $x=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_ie_i$, $y=\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_ie_i$, and $f$ such that$$\forall i\in [1,n], f(e_i)=\frac{y_i}{x_i}e_i$$ does the job : $$f(x)=f(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_ie_i)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_if(e_i)=y$$
The matrix of $f$ in the said base is diagonal, with diagonal elements equal to $\frac {y_i}{x_i}$ therefore $f\in GL_n(\mathbb{K})$.

For that, I need to take two measure spaces, $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ and $(\mathbb{C}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{C}), c)$, and construct the product measure in the appropriate way. Looking at the definition of the (Riemann) contour integral, the first thought would be to proceed as is done with the Riemann-Stieltjes integrals to properly choose the measure $c$ so that $\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \int_{\tilde{\gamma}} f dc$ (where $\tilde{\gamma}$ is some subset of $\mathbb{C}$ associated to the countour $\gamma$.

We say that $A$ is syndetic if there exists some $M \geq 0$ such that $A_{i+1} - A_i \le M$ for all $i =1,2,..$ (that is, ""the gaps of $A$ are uniformly bounded""). The natural density of $A$, if it exists, is defined to be
$$d(A) = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{|A \cap \{1,2,..., N\}|}{N} = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{N}{A_N}.$$
It is possible that the limit does not exist. The examples of this phenomenon that I've seen all use the same idea. You need to have a set which first contains a lot of elements of $\{1,2,..N\}$, then misses a lot of $\{N, N+1, ..., N'\}$ then has a lot of $\{N' + 1, ..., N''\}$, etc. A common example is given by
$$A = [2^3, 2^5] \cup [2^7, 2^9] \cup ... \cup [2^{4k-1}, 2^{4k+1}] \cup ...$$
Such examples cannot be syndetic. In the specific given example the problem is that the gaps $[2^{4k+1}, 2^{4k + 5}]$ are not bounded as $k \to \infty$. So my question is: how can one construct a syndetic set with no natural density (if possible)? Even better: can you construct $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ such that $A$ and $\mathbb{N} \setminus A$ are syndetic and such that $A$ has no density?

Show that for all $0\lt\theta\lt1$, and $1\leq r \leq \infty$ there exits a $B\gt0$ such that
  $$
\|Tf\|_{L^{\large q_\theta,r}(Y)} \leq B \|f\|_{L^{\large p_\theta , r }(X)}
$$
  for all simple functions $f$ of finite measure support, where the Lorentz norms $L^{p,q}$ were defined in Exercise 7. (Hint: repeat the proof of the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem, but partition the sum $\sum_{n,m}$ into regions of the form $\{n\alpha q_\theta-mp_\theta=k+O(1)\}$ for integer $k$. Obtain a bound for each summand which decreases geometrically as $k\to\pm\infty$.) Conclude that the hypotheses $p_0\le q_0$, $p_1\le q_1$ in the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem can be replaced by $p_\theta\le q_\theta$. This Lorentz space version of the interpolation theorem is in some sense the “right” version of the theorem, but the Lorentz spaces are slightly more technical to deal with than the Lebesgue spaces, and the Lebesgue space version of Marcinkiewicz interpolation is largely sufficient for most applications. I can see how to approach it using duality between $L^{q,r}$ and $L^{q',r'}$ in case that $q_{\theta} > 1$ , but I want to know also how to approach it using tao approach sketched in a comment in the same note where he introduced a frequency envelope.The following is the comment ( I suggest reading his proof of marinkiewicz ) ah, yes, this is a little delicate, in part because the decomposition of f used here is actually not the optimal one for this problem – it decomposes the height  of the function dyadically (vertical dyadic decomposition), when in fact it is the width  that ought to be dyadically decomposed (horizontal dyadic decomposition). One can still recover from this point by decomposing the sequence  into dyadic pieces, but this is quite messy.Another approach is to use frequency envelopes. Pick a small $\epsilon$ and replace $a_ m $ by the slightly larger envelope $ b_m : = \sup_{m'} 2^{\epsilon |m-m'|} a_{m'}$ ' The point of doing so is that the $b_m $ obey a Lipschitz property $2^{-\epsilon |m-m'|} b_{m'} \leq b_m \leq 2^{\epsilon |m-m'|} b_{m'} $ but are still summable in $l^1$ . One then chooses $c_{n,m}$  to be adapted to the crossover point between the two quantities in the $\min $ (modifying the $n \alpha q_{\theta} - m p_{\theta} $  term by some multiple of $\log b_m$ ); as long as the Lipschitz parameter $\epsilon$  is small enough, one will still be able to close the argument I only want to see how frequency envelopes work .

Now assuming that L is orthogonal, I'm asked to prove that $F_{11}+\dots+F_{nn}=f_{11}+\dots+f_{nn}$ (these are also 2nd order partial derivatives).

577725,Reconstructing a manifold from critical points,"I am teaching theoretical calculus this semester, and on the last discussion section we were discussing critical points of functions. I explained the idea of Morse theory, and a student of mine asked me a question that I couldn't answer. I don't know a lot about the Morse theory, so the question might actually be easy. I would really appreciate if you can help me, or at least give me a reference. Suppose you are given an ordered set of signatures (i.e. number of $+$ and $-$ of the hessian) $\{(a_1,b_1),\dots,(a_r,b_r)\}$, that is supposed to be a set of critical points of some Morse function on a would be a $k$-manifold. The question is the following: When there exists a manifold with a Morse function having a given set of signatures of critical points? It is easy to see that the set of signatures must have signatures of the form $(k,0)$ and $(0,k)$, since any function on a compact manifold must have minimum and maximum. Also, we can't start with, say, $(k-1,1)$, since you must start with the point of minimum, which must be of signature $(k,0)$. Also, it is not true that we can always construct a manifold with given ordered set of signatures. For example, take the set $\{ (2,0) , (1,1), (0,2) \}$. Following the algorithm, first we attach a 0-cell, then we attach a 1-cell. Topologically it will be equivalent to a letter U made out of a tube (cylinder). But then you need two ""caps"" to make it into a closed compact thing, but we have only one critical point left. I have no idea what are the conditions when we can actually construct a required manifold. I've heard (but I am not sure if it is true) that if we have passed a sertain number of critical points in out reconstructing algorithm (maybe more than $r/2+1$), then there is unique way to finish the procedure to get a closed compact manifold. If this is correct, is it still true that we can always get a manifold having any set of the first $r/2+1$ signatures?

577745,Proofs without words of some well-known historical values of $\pi$?,"Two of the earliest known documented approximations of the value of $\pi$ are $\pi_B=\frac{25}{8}=3.125$ and $\pi_E=\left(\frac{16}{9}\right)^2$, from Babylonian and Egyptian sources respectively. I've read that the Egyptian figure at least could be justified through some geometrical diagram which made the approximation a visually obvious statement about the areas of circles and squares. As far as I know, the Babylonian value on the other hand could have simply been obtained empirically through direct measurement of circle diameters and circumferences; I really have no idea. My question is simply can anyone provide simple visual proofs of these approximations? It doesn't matter to me if the proofs happen to be the historically used ones or not, as long as they get the job done. Side-note: The Egyptian value pertains to the area-$\pi$, whereas the Babylonian one is about the circumference-$\pi$.

Given a set of nonempty sets $F$ , define the set $\mathcal{F}$ to be: $\mathcal{F}=\{f \mid f \space is \space a \space choice \space function \space on \space a \space subset \space of \space F\}$ . ( $\mathcal{F}$ is not empty since on subsets of $F$ , that contain only one set, one can easily define a choice function). Define a relation $\leq$ on $\mathcal{F}$ in the following way:
given $f_1,f_2\in\mathcal{F}$ which are choice functions on $\mathcal{A_1},\mathcal{A_2} \subseteq F$ , we say that $f_1 \leq f_2$ if $\mathcal{A_1} \subseteq \mathcal{A_2}$ and $f_2|_{\mathcal{A_1}}=f_1$ . We will show that: $\langle\mathcal F,\leq\rangle\\$ is a partially order relation. Every chain in $\langle \mathcal{F},\leq \rangle$ , has an upper bound in $\mathcal{F}$ , and therefor, by Zorn's lemma, $\langle\mathcal{F},\leq \rangle$ has a maximal element. This maximal element is a choice function on $F$ . Proof of 1: reflexivity: $(f_1,f_1) \in \leq$ , since, of course, $f_1|_{\mathcal{A_1}}=f_1$ antisymmetry: given $f_1 \leq f_2$ and $f_2 \leq f_1$ , we get that $\mathcal{A_1}=\mathcal{A_2}$ , and $f_1|_{\mathcal{A_2}}=f_2$ and $f_2|_{\mathcal{A_1}}=f_1$ which implies $f_1=f_2$ . in a similar (rather obvious) way the transitivity can be proved. Proof of 2: given a chain $f_1 \leq f_2 \leq ...$ take $f:\bigcup \mathcal{A_i} \rightarrow \bigcup f_i$ to be the function s.t. $f|_{\mathcal{A_i}} = f_i$ , for every $i$ .
Then $f$ is an upper bound for the chain, and $f \in \mathcal{F}$ . Proof of 3: Take $g$ , to be the maximal element from 2. we have to show that $g$ is a choice function on all sets in $F$ , and that it is well defined. choice function on all $F$ : suppose not, there exists a set $A \in \mathcal{F}$ s.t. $g$ , is not defined on $A$ . $A$ is not empty, so, take some $a \in A$ and define $h$ to be: $h(X)=\begin{cases}
a,&\text{if } X=A\\
g(X),&\text{if } X \neq A
\end{cases}$ Then $g < h$ contradicting the fact that $g$ is maximal. $g$ is well defined : Suppose not, there exists an $A \in \mathcal{F}$ and $a_1,a_2 \in A$ where $a_1 \neq a_2$ , such that $g(A)=a_1$ and $g(A)=a_2$ . but then, from the construction of $g$ , there exists an $f_i$ with domain $\mathcal{A_i}$ , which is not well defined, which is also a contradiction. Therefor $g$ , is a choice function. What do you think? Thank you!

where $\mathbf{LocRngSpace}$ is the category of locally ringed spaces, $\mathbf{Ring}$ the category of commutative unitary rings, $\Gamma$ the global sections functor and $\mathrm{Spec}$ the usual functor taking a ring to the affine scheme on its spectrum. I'm then trying to work out the following idea (as an exercise) : retrieving the notion of affine schemes by applying Freyd's adjoint theorem to the global sections functor 
$$  {\mathbf{LocRngSpace}}^{\mathrm{op}} \overset{\Gamma}{\to} \mathbf{Ring}.$$
I have already showed that $\mathbf{LocRngSpace}$ is cocomplete and that $\Gamma$ commutes with limits (of ${\mathbf{LocRngSpace}}^{\mathrm{op}}$). It remains to prove that $\Gamma$ satisfies the set condition : that is for every ring $R$ there exists a set $I$ indexing a family $(X_i)$ of locally ringed spaces and a family of ring morphisms $(r_i \colon R \to \Gamma X_i)$ such that for every locally ringed space $X$ and $f \colon R \to \Gamma X$, there is $i \in I$ and a morphism of locally ringed spaces $h \colon X \to X_i$ such that commutes

R @>{f}>> \Gamma X \\
@V{r_i}VV @| \\
\Gamma X_i @>>{\Gamma h}> \Gamma X.

Of course, I'm trying to avoid using $I = \{\ast\}$ and $X_\ast = \mathrm{Spec R}$… However, knowing about $\mathrm{Spec}$, I know that $\Gamma X$ could be any ring : so I can't expect some simplification about the $f$s. I've tried to take $I$ the set of prime ideals $\mathfrak p$ of $R$ and $X_{\mathfrak p} = (\{\ast\}, R_{\mathfrak p})$ but it will factorize only the $f \colon R \to B$ such that the ideal of $R$ generated by $R \setminus f^{-1}(B^\times)$ is strict. So it seems that I have to consider (for the $X_i$) locally ringed spaces that aren't (all) singleton as a topological space : but then I dangerously drift to $\mathrm{Spec} R$… Any hint ?","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'category-theory', 'affine-schemes', 'adjoint-functors']"
