1991212,Partial sum of the harmonic series between two consecutive fibonacci numbers,"I was playing around with some calculations and I noticed that the partial sum of the harmonic series:
$$s_n=\sum_{k=F_n}^{F_{n+1}}\frac 1 k$$
where $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ are two consecutive Fibonacci numbers have some interesting properties. It is close to $\frac 1 2$ for small values of $n$ and it seems to converge to a value less than $0.5$ for large $n$. This is what I've got so far:
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} s_n\approx 0.481212$$
I googled a bit to see if there is some theorems or resources for this, and found nothing. I suspect that the series might converge to a smaller number and I may have reached some computational limitations which led to the conclusion that the limit is close to $\frac 1 2$. So my questions are: Can we show that the series converge to a non-zero value? In case the first answer is yes, can the limit be expressed in a closed form?","['fibonacci-numbers', 'harmonic-numbers', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"

1991322,Is the Euclidean plane equal to $\mathbb{R}^2$?,"I understand what the Cartesian plane is and how one can identify the Euclidean plane and $\mathbb{R}^2$ in many different ways. My question comes down to this though: The Euclidean plane (as defined in the link) has no distinguished points , whereas $\mathbb{R}^2$ very clearly has a distinguished point in the origin $(0,0)$ . Therefore, doesn't it only make sense to identify $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the tangent spaces of the Euclidean plane, which very clearly do have distinguished points? One often says that $\mathbb{R}^n$ is ""Euclidean space"", which admittedly does make sense from the viewpoint of analysis, algebra, and topology, among others. However, it seems like from a geometric and a categorical viewpoint, saying that the two are the same could only lead to confusion. A similar, but certainly not identical view, seems to be voiced by Professor Lee in his book Introduction to Smooth Manifolds , p. 51 of chapter 3: ...We have to come terms with a dichotomy in the way we think about elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . On one hand, we usually think of them as points in space, whose only property is location, expressed by the coordinates $(x^1, \dots, x^n)$ . On the other hand, when doing calculus we sometimes think of them instead as vectors , which are objects that have magnitude and direction, but whose location is irrelevant. A vector $v=v^ie_i$ (where $e_i$ denotes the $i$ th standard basis vector) can be visualized as an arrow with its initial point anywhere in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ; what is relevant from the vector point of view is only which direction it points and how long it is. What we really have in mind here is a separate copy of $\mathbb{R}^n$ at each point. When we talk about vectors tangent to the sphere at a point $a$ , for example, we imagine them as living in a copy of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its origin translated to $a$ . EDIT: To clarify, $\mathbb{R}^2$ should in theory mean just a pair of reals, however this is not what my question refers to. In practice, people seem to refer to "" $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the standard inner product, the standard norm which is the norm induced by the standard inner product, the standard metric which is the metric induced by the standard norm, and the standard topology which is the topology induced by the standard metric"" as "" $\mathbb{R}^2$ "", and to call of these structures X the ""Euclidean X"", i.e. the ""Euclidean inner product"", ""Euclidean norm"", ""Euclidean metric"", ""Euclidean topology"", and then call $\mathbb{R}^2$ itself the ""Euclidean plane"". Ideally there would be different terms for both of these objects, but in practice there does not seem to be. My question is about the difference between the Euclidean plane (of Euclid) and "" $\mathbb{R}^2$ "" as conceived of in elementary textbooks in linear algebra and real analysis, where all of the standard additional structures which could be defined on the space are assumed to be defined on the space. END EDIT For instance, the Euclidean plane isn't a vector space without specifying an origin, in which case one is essentially identifying it with its tangent space at that point. Moreover, keeping this distinction in mind makes it clear why linear and affine transformations should be considered different, since the latter requires moving between different tangent spaces of the plane. Also, Euclidean space clearly isn't an inner product space either, because given two points of Euclidean space, their angle is not defined (in contrast to the angle between two non-zero elements of $\mathbb{R}^2$ ). The angle between two lines or two line segments is defined only when they intersect at a distinguished point with respect to which the angle is calculated. Not incidentally the angle between vectors in the tangent space based at that point corresponding to the given lines or line segments equals the same angle as defined in Euclidean space -- i.e. one can use the metric space structure of Euclidean space to define a Riemannian metric on its tangent spaces. I know that when $\mathbb{R}^2$ is considered as an algebraic group (e.g. addition is continuous, translation is a homeomorphism) results for neighborhoods at $(0,0)$ magically apply for neighborhoods at every point, and thus we can show that $\mathbb{R}^2$ with such a topology is homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane. However that doesn't mean that addition of points is a priori well-defined in the Euclidean plane, since there is no natural choice for the additive identity element, unlike in $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Only the tangent spaces of the Euclidean plane have natural choices for an additive identity element. Note: Almost the exact same question has been asked, but in greater generality, here . However, the only answer to that question ""it's a matter of choosing a coordinate system"" was not accepted and I also find it unsatisfactory -- if $\mathbb{R}^2$ comes with a standard coordinate system, but the Euclidean plane does not, then clearly they are not the same object, at least they clearly are not isomorphic in at least some category. The answer to this question comes closer to being precise, but it still seems to waffle somewhat, and hence was also unaccepted. This similar question was unanswered. If one is concerned about the construction of the Euclidean plane without using $\mathbb{R}^2$ , there exists an axiomatization of the object in the framework of absolute geometry plus the appropriate parallel postulate for Euclidean space, which does not start from $\mathbb{R}^2$ , for example, see Elementary Geometry by Agricola and Friedrich. From a geometric point of view it seems to make more sense to think of the plane this way, because then its geometry is ""intrinsic"", rather than being the result of being embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , and thus better motivates the idea of abstract manifolds existing in their own right without necessarily having to be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ , as well as the ideas that the geometry of the hyperbolic or projective plane should be on an equal footing with that of the Euclidean plane.","['category-theory', 'geometry']"
1991336,Cholesky decomposition vs. $\mathbf L\mathbf D\mathbf L^\top$ decomposition,"In different books and on Wikipedia, you can see frequent mentions of Cholesky decomposition and $\mathbf L\mathbf D\mathbf L^\top$ decomposition is seldom mentioned. Why so?

1991340,What is a curve? (Definition),"Studing for an introductory differential geometry course I've come across a lot of variations for the definition of a curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$, ranging from the most general one, admiting any continuous function on a real interval $I$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$ as a curve, to very narrow ones defining it as a finite union of the graphs of regular curve parametrizations (or something like that).

1991380,A set M of X is dense IFF the intersection of an open ball in X is non-empty.,"Theorem: M is dense in X IFF for all $x \in X$ and $\epsilon >0, B_{\epsilon }\left ( x \right ) \cap M$ is non-empty. Def: A subset M of a metric space X is called dense in X if the closure $\bar{M}$ is equal to X. Suppose that M is dense. Then, there exists $\bar{M}=X$ . Suppose to the contrary that there exists some $x \in X$ and $\epsilon >0$ : $B_{\epsilon }\left ( x \right ) =\varnothing$ .
The complement $X \setminus  B_{\epsilon }\left ( x \right )$ is a proper closed subset of X.
It is proper because $X \setminus  B_{\epsilon }\left ( x \right )$ does not equal X. Closed because the open ball is an open set and the complement of an open set is closed. BUT, here is where things goes awry and despite looking at it for hours, I cannot understand. My notes mentioned that $X \setminus  B_{\epsilon }\left ( x \right )$ contains M. How can this be true? It seems nonsensical to me. $B_{\epsilon }\left ( x \right ) \cap M$ is non-empty. Drawing a simple picture illustrates the fact that 'removing' the open ball removes elements in M. So anything that encloses $X \setminus  B_{\epsilon }\left ( x \right )$ is non-empty so cannot contain M. Any clarification is appreciated.

1991386,2D standardization of a matrix,"Given an n-by-n matrix $A$, and using only linear transformation on each of the rows and columns of $A$ (total of $2n$ transformations), is there a way to double-standardize a matrix, so that each row and each column have zero mean and unit variance? Define centering matrix as follow:
$$ C_n = I_n-\frac{1}{n}O_n $$
where $I_n$ is the identity matrix of size $n$ and $O_n$ is an n-by-n matrix of all 1's. An n-by-n matrix $X$ is called doubly-centered if:
$$ X = C_n X C_n $$ A matrix is doubly centered, iff the mean of each row and each column is $0$. It's a common practice in many fields to standardize data into zero mean and unit variance, given a set of numbers with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, the following linear transformation will standardize that set:
$$ g(x) = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} $$ It's easy to double-center a matrix, using only row/column linear transformation, by subtracting the mean of every row/column and adding back the grand mean of the whole matrix. It's also easy to standardize all rows (or columns) of a matrix using only $n$ linear transformations, one for each row (see $g(x)$ above). What I'm trying to do is to simultaneously standardize all rows and columns of a matrix in a similar way, is it possible?","['matrices', 'statistics', 'standard-deviation', 'linear-algebra']"

1991465,Is the cusp of $\sqrt{\left|x-\frac 1 2\right|}$ differentiable?,"Consider the vector space $$\mathcal V=\left\{f:[0,1]\to\mathbb R\ \left|\ \sup_{x\neq y}\frac{|f(x)-f(y)|}{\sqrt{|x-y|}}\lt \infty \ \text{ and }\ f\left(\frac 1 2\right)=0 \right. \right\}$$
  Show that the function $f(x)=\sqrt{\left|x-\frac 12\right|}$ belongs to $\mathcal V$. When $x\neq y$, $\ \sup_{x\neq y}\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{\sqrt{x-y}}=\frac{\mathrm d f}{\mathrm d x}\cdot\sqrt{x-y},\ $ and since $f$ is differentiable for $x\in[0,\frac 12)\cup(\frac 12,1]$, the only point to investigate is $x=\frac 12$. I don't see why the property would be satisfied at $x=\frac 12$ because I think the derivative of $f$ tends to $\pm$ infinity and doesn't exist. I thought that solving 
$$\lim_{x\to\frac 12}\lim_{y\to \frac 12}\frac{\left|\sqrt{\left|x-\frac 12\right|}-\sqrt{\left|y-\frac 12\right|}\right|}{\sqrt{|x-y|}}$$ 
or even
$$\lim_{x\to\frac 12^+}\lim_{y\to \frac 12^-}\frac{\left|\sqrt{x-\frac 12}-\sqrt{\frac 12-y}\right|}{\sqrt{x-y}}$$

1991471,"If $\exp(t(A + B)) = \exp(tA) \exp(tB)$ for all $t \geq 0$ then $A,B$ commute","Let $A,B$ be complex valued square matrices. If $\exp(t(A + B)) = \exp(tA) \exp(tB)$ for all $t \geq 0$ then $A,B$ commute. The converse of this statement can be an easy application of the Cauchy product rule and the binomial theorem. Note that this statement doesn't hold, if we restrict ourselves to $t = 1$. So far I have been trying to use the fact, that $A$ and $B$ are infinitesimal generators to the semigroups $\{\exp(tA)\}$ and $\{\exp(tB)\}$ but I have had no success. Do you have any other hints? Based on the idea of @Did, I came up with the following: Series expansions give me:
$$
\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{t^n(A + B)^n}{n!} = I + tA + tB + \frac{t^2(AB + BA)}{2} + \sum_{n = 3}^\infty \frac{t^n(A + B)^n}{n!} 
$$
and
$$
\left(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{t^n(A)^n}{n!} \right) \left(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{t^n(B)^n}{n!} \right)
= I + tA + tB + \frac{t^2A^2}{2} +  t^2AB +  \frac{t^2B^2}{2} + \sum_{n = 3}^\infty t^n c_n,
$$
where 
$$
c_n := \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{A^k B^{n - k}}{k! n!}.
$$ The comparison of both expansions gives
$$
\frac{t^2(AB + BA)}{2} + \sum_{n = 3}^\infty \frac{t^n(A + B)^n}{n!} 
= t^2AB + \sum_{n = 3}^\infty t^n c_n.
$$
Division by $t > 0$ yields:
$$
\frac{(AB + BA)}{2} + \sum_{n = 3}^\infty \frac{t^{n-2}(A + B)^n}{n!} 
= AB + \sum_{n = 3}^\infty t^{n-2} c_n.
$$
But I can't quite see, why the two sums $\sum_{n = 3}^\infty \dots$ should go to $0$ for $t \to 0$ yielding the desired equality
$$
\frac{(AB + BA)}{2}  
= AB .

1991575,Why can't the second fundamental theorem of calculus be proved in just two lines?,"The second fundamental theorem of calculus states that if $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ on the same interval, then: $$\int_a^b f(x) dx= F(b)-F(a).$$ The proof of this theorem in both my textbook and Wikipedia is pretty complex and long. It uses the mean value theorem of integration and the limit of an infinite Riemann summation. But I tried coming up with a proof and it was barely two lines. Here it goes: Since $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ , we have $\frac{dF}{dx} = f(x)$ . Multiplying both sides by $dx$ ,  we obtain $dF = f(x)dx$ . Now, $dF$ is just the small change in $F$ and $f(x)dx$ represents the infinitesimal area bounded by the curve and the $x$ axis. So integrating both sides, we arrive at the required result. First, what is wrong with my proof? And if it is so simple, what is so fundamental about it? Multiplying the equation by $dx$ should be an obvious step to find infinitesimal area, right? Why is the Wikipedia (and textbook) proof so long? I have also read that the connection between differential and integral calculus is not obvious, making the fundamental theorem a surprising result. But to me, it seems trivial. So, what were the wrong assumptions I made in the proof and what am I taking for granted? It should be noted that I have already learnt differential and integral calculus and I am being taught the ""fundamental theorem"" in the end and not as the first link between the two realms of calculus. In response to the answers below: If expressing infinitesimals on their own is not ""rigorous"" enough to be used in a proof, then what more sense do they make when written along with an integral sign, or even in the notation for the derivative? The integral is just the continuous sum of infinitesimals, correct? And the derivative is just the quotient of two. How else should these be defined or intuitively explained?

(b) Construct a sequence $\left\{ s_n \right\}$ which does not converge, although $\lim \ \sigma_n = 0$ . (c) Can it happen that $s_n > 0$ for all $n$ and that $\lim \sup s_n = \infty$ , although $\lim \ \sigma_n = 0$ ? (d) Put $a_n = s_n - s_{n-1}$ , for $n \geq 1$ . Show that $$s_n - \sigma_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=1}^n k a_k.$$ Assume that $\lim \left( n a_n \right) = 0$ and that $\left\{ \sigma_n \right\}$ converges. Prove that $\left\{ s_n \right\}$ converges. [This gives a converse of (a), but under the aditional assumption that $n a_n \to 0$ . ] (e) Derive the last condition from a weaker hypothesis: Assume $M < \infty$ , $\left\vert n a_n \right\vert \leq M$ for all $n$ , and $\lim \ \sigma_n = \sigma$ . Prove that $\lim s_n  = \sigma$ , by completing the following outline: If $m < n$ , then $$s_n - \sigma_n = \frac{m+1}{n-m} \left( \sigma_n - \sigma_m \right) + \frac{1}{n-m} \sum_{i=m+1}^n \left( s_n - s_i \right).$$ For these $i$ , $$ \left\vert s_n - s_i \right\vert \leq \frac{(n-i)M}{i+1} \leq \frac{(n-m-1)M}{m+2}.$$ Fix $\varepsilon > 0$ and associate with each $n$ the integer $m$ that satisfies $$ m \leq \frac{n-\varepsilon}{1+ \varepsilon} < m +1.$$ Then $\frac{m+1}{n-m} \leq \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ and $\left\vert s_n - s_i \right\vert < M \varepsilon$ . Hence $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \sup \left\vert s_n - \sigma \right\vert \leq M \varepsilon.$$ Since $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, $\lim s_n = \sigma$ . My effort: Part (a): If $\lim s_n = s$ , then we can find a natural number $N$ such that $n > N$ implies that $$ \left\vert s_n - s \right\vert < 1.$$ So, for $n > N$ , we have \begin{align}
\left\vert \sigma_n - s \right\vert &= \left\vert \frac{ s_0 + s_1 + \cdots + s_n}{n +1} - s \right\vert \\
&\leq \frac{1}{n+1} \left( \left\vert s_0 - s \right\vert +  \cdots + \left\vert s_N - s \right\vert + \cdots + \left\vert s_n - s \right\vert \right) \\
&\leq \frac{1}{n+1} \left( (N+1) \max \left\{ \left\vert s_0 - s \right\vert, \ldots,  \left\vert s_N - s \right\vert \right\} + \left\vert s_{N+1} - s \right\vert + \cdots + \left\vert s_n - s \right\vert \right) \\

\end{align} Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. What next? Part (b): Let $s_n = (-1){n+1}$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$ . Then $$ \sigma_n = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{n+1} \ \mbox{ if } n \mbox{ is even}; \\ 0 \ \mbox{ if } n \mbox{ is odd}. \end{cases} $$ Then $\left\{ s_n \right\}$ fails to converge, but $\lim \ \sigma_n = 0$ . Is this example correct? Part (c): My feeling is the answer is no, but I cannot establish this rigorously. How to? Part (d): If we put $a_n = s_n - s_{n-1}$ , for $n \geq 1$ , then $s_n = a_0 + s_1 + \cdots + a_n$ , and so \begin{align}
s_n - \sigma_n &= s_n - \frac{ s_0 + s_1 + \cdots + s_n}{n+1} \\
&= \frac{ (n+1) s_n - s_0 - s_1 - \cdots - s_n }{n+1} \\ 
&= \frac{ (n+1) \left( s_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_n \right) - s_0 - \left( s_0 + a_1 \right) - \left( s_0 + a_1 + a_2 \right) - \cdot -  \left( s_0 + a_1 +  \cdots + a_n \right) }{n+1} \\
&= \frac{ a_1 + 2 a_2 + \cdots + n a_n }{n+1}.
\end{align} Now we assume that $\lim_{n \to \infty} n a_n = 0$ and that $\left\{ \sigma_n \right\}$ converges. How to show that $\left\{ s_n \right\}$ convreges? Part (e): If $m < n$ , then \begin{align}
& \frac{ m+1 }{ n-m } \left( \sigma_n - \sigma_m \right) + \frac{1}{n-m} \sum_{i = m+1}^n \left( s_n - s_i \right) \\
&= \frac{ m+1 }{ n-m } \left( \frac{ s_0 + s_1 + \cdots + s_n}{n+1} - \frac{ s_0 + s_1 + \cdots + s_m}{m+1}  \right) + \frac{1}{n-m} \sum_{i = m+1}^n \left( s_n - s_i \right) \\
&= s_n + \frac{1}{n-m} \left[ (m+1) \frac{ s_0 + \cdots + s_n}{n+1} - \left( s_0 + \cdots + s_n \right) \right] \\
&= s_n - \sigma_n.

I just had to provide two sets with 3 elements each. Question b is where I tripped down a rabbit hole. Yes, in this context, |S| is a cardinality function, because S denotes a set. What I am wondering then, is if |n| in the next question is simply an absolute value function (so in this case, only {3} , {-3} could be elements of M ). Given the context, I am concerned that |n| might have something to do with cardinality that I am not understanding. I assume that the element n is not guaranteed to be a set, given that its lower case and conventionally used as a variable with numerical value in Discrete Mathamatics. This is why I suspect that absolute value might come into play when this |x| notation isn't being used on a Set. After all, I haven't seen anything about cardinality relating to just elements anywhere. Plus, I wonder if one intended to create an inequality condition with set logic; Isn't this how it would look?

1991946,"Suggested name for ""inflated"" tetrahedron","What's the name or class of the following tetrahedron-like shape? Sketchup Model WebGL 3D-viewer It's apparently some sort of (not strictly convex) shell of a tetrahedron and it's scaled spherical projection dual compound, which both share the same outer cube. It has some interesting properties, since it's still unfoldable to a flat net, and when used as a projection surface, as in the Authagraph world map has a less abrupt change in curvature, and therefore less angular distortion than a regular tetrahedron . It's construction can be described of placing 6 intersecting oblique solid bicones with their straight long edge (apex-circle-apex is a straight line normal to the base circle's plane) on the edges of the tetrahedron, and circle centers placed at the centroid. It's therefore not! constructable from 4 right circular cones placed with apexes on the tetrahedron's vertices. If the cone base circle is a unit circle, the height of the cone is $\sqrt2$ or double that for the bicone. The surface is the sum of 6 bicone segments with an angle of 109.5° or  $\cos^{−1}(-\frac13)$ encompassing the edge on the orthogonal circle. One of the 6 bi-cones placed on a tetrahedronal edge Note the adjoined cones don't meet at flat surface, but something like 163.5° (~16°) making the shape effectively concave.

1992013,Deformations and blow-down,"I would like to understand how blowing down affects (first order) deformations.

Now blow down the $y$-axis. In other words, consider the map to $\text k[u,v]/(uv)$ given by $$(t,0)\mapsto (t,0), (t,1)\mapsto (0,t), (0,t)\mapsto (0,0)$$ which, if I am correct, should be given by $$u\mapsto x(y-1),v\mapsto xy$$ (or maybe the other way around, doesn't matter). Now it is clear that $uv-\epsilon(au+bv)$ (again, maybe I switched $a$ and $b$) maps to $0$, so the structure at the node is $$D[u,v]/(uv-\epsilon(au+bv))$$ whose completion is $D[[u,v]]/(uv)$ (only constant term matters, and here it is $0$), so it is a trivial deformation. I would have expected something like $D[[u,v]]/(uv-\epsilon(a+b))$... what did I do wrong? Do really all deformations blow down to the trivial one?

If not, everyone in the room is taken out and let go on their merry way and $10x$ people are then placed in the room and the experiment continues on like this until one group rolls a double six at which point it is complete. The usual question is ""Knowing that you are entering the room what is the chance that you will get shot?"". It would initially seem like the chance is $1/36$ but over $90\%$ of people that enter the room in any given run of the experiment are actually killed so this is the chance of you getting killed. Taking an example of the experiment starting with one person: If it ends on the first go $1/1$ people involved have been killed giving $100\%$ , if it ends on the second $10/11$ have been killed (the first didn't roll double sixes and was set free) giving approximately $90.91\%$ and $\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{9\times10^n}{10^{n+1}-1}=0.9$ which is where the answer of $90\%$ comes from. But as this is the absolute minimum proportion of people killed, the actual expected value must be higher than this. If rather than rolling two sixes, the criterion for getting shot was rolling any number at all then the death rate would be $100\%$ and if it was to get any number except 1 on a 100-sided die would we not expect the death rate to be a fair bit higher than $90\%$ ?

\begin{align}

&= u \ln\sin(u) - \int \ln\sin(u) du

\int \ln\sin(u) du &= \int \ln\left(\frac{\mathrm{e}^{iu} - \mathrm{e}^{-iu}}{i2} \right) du \\
&= \int \ln\left(\mathrm{e}^{iu} - \mathrm{e}^{-iu} \right) du \,- \int \ln(i2) du \\
&= \int \ln\left(1 - \mathrm{e}^{-i2u} \right) du + \int \ln\mathrm{e}^{iu} du \,-\, u\ln(i2) \\

\begin{equation}
\int \ln\left(1 - \mathrm{e}^{-i2u} \right) du = \frac{i}{2} \int \frac{\ln(1-y)}{y} dy

So then does the difference between differentiable manifolds and non-differentiable topological manifolds come down to the following: Differentiable manifolds resemble $\mathbb{R}^k$ in the sense of both (1) and (2). Non-differentiable topological manifolds resemble $\mathbb{R}^k$ only in the sense of (2).

However I met also the following definition: Spin structure on oriented $M$ is a principial $spin(n)$ bundle $P$ together with an explicit isomorphism $P \times_{\rho} \mathbb{R}^n \cong TM$ (left hand side is associated bundle). I would like to understand how this definition implies the standard one. Here are some my attempts: 1. There is always the isomorphism $O(M) \times_{id} \mathbb{R}^n \cong TM$ where $O(M)$ is orthonormal frame bundle. Once $M$ is oriented we can replace $O(M)$ by $SO(M)$. 2. Therefore our assumption gives us isomorphism $P \times_{\rho} \mathbb{R}^n \cong SO(M) \times_{id} \mathbb{R}^n$ so we get that the two associated bundles are isomorphic. Does it follows from this that we have an equivariant map $\eta:P \to SO(M)$?

I know that if $K\cap H=\mathbf{0}$ and $KH=G$ then $K\times H\cong G$. I'm trying to understand what is it about the category of groups which makes this statement true. Since intersection and multiplication of normal subgroups are respectively their meet and join in the subobject poset of $G$, the conditions are $K\wedge H=\bf 0$ and $K\vee H=G$. For linear categories, we may use the fact binary unions are effective to calculate the union as the pushout of $K,H$ along $K\wedge H$, which is their coproduct=biproduct=product, and we're done. But groups have no biproducts. So what's the story from the categorical perspective? Added. Just after asking this question I realized I should check Borceux and Bourne's book on protomodular categories. There lies a section on complemented subobjects in unital categories.

The first one, would be this one , due to Nicolas, where it is stated that RH would hold iff: $$\frac{N_k}{\phi{(N_k)}} > e^{\gamma} \ln{(\ln{(N_k)})}$$ holded for every $k$ being $N_k$ the primorial of order $k$ and $\phi{(N_k)}$ its Euler's Totient function.

As, in this case, $\frac{N_k}{\phi{(N_k)}} = \prod_{p \le p_k} \frac{p}{p-1}$, we can try to see if this holds: $$e^{\gamma}(\ln{p_k})(1-\frac{1}{2(\ln{p_k})^{2}})>e^{\gamma} \ln{\ln{N_k}}$$ Hence $$\ln{p_k}-\frac{1}{2\ln{p_k}}>\ln{\ln{N_k}}$$ For it to be more clear, we can change $\ln{N_k}$ by $\theta{(k)}$ (Chebyshev's First Function) so that $$\ln{p_k}-\frac{1}{2\ln{p_k}}>\ln{\theta{(k)}}$$ From there, we could easily get to $$\frac{1}{2\ln{p_k}}<\ln{\frac{p_k}{\theta{(k)}}}$$ And, with the bounds of Theorems 3 (3.12) and 4 (3.15), we get $$\frac{1}{2\ln{p_k}}<\ln{\frac{\ln{k}}{1+ \frac{1}{2\ln{k}}}}$$ What would be true for every big enought k, meaning that $$\frac{N_k}{\phi{(N_k)}} > e^{\gamma} \ln{(\ln{(N_k)})}$$ holds, and, with so, RH.

1992951,"Vieta Jumping: Related to IMO problem 6, 1988: If $ab + 1$ divides $a^2 + b^2$ then $ab + 1$ cannot be a perfect square.","The famous IMO problem 6 states that if $a,b$ are positive integers, such that $ab + 1$ divides $a^2 + b^2$, then $\frac{ a^2 + b^2}{ab + 1 }$ is a perfect square, namely, $gcd(a,b)^2$.  How about a modification of this problem: If $a,b$ are (strictly) positive integers, such that $ab + 1$ divides $a^2 + b^2$, then $ab + 1$ cannot be a perfect square. I am looking for a proof of the claim above, or a counter-example. One possible approach towards a proof is the following: Suppose there is such a pair $(a,b)$ as above, then by the famous IMO problem 6 from 1988, $\frac{ a^2 + b^2}{ab + 1 } = g^2$ where $g = gcd(a,b)$. Since $ab + 1$ is a perfect square, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ for some integer $c$. So that $(a,b,c)$ is a Pythagorean tripple, therefore there exists positive integers $n,m,l$ with $n$ coprime to $m$, such that $a = l(n^2 - m^2)$ and $b = 2lnm$ - by Euclids formula. Then by plugging in $a$ and $b$ in terms of $n,m,l$ into the original equation, and solving for $l$, it is possible to obtain the following: There exists positive coprime integers $n,m$ such that $\frac{(n^2 + m^2 + 1)(n^2 + m^2 - 1)}{2mn(n+m)(n-m)}$ is a perfect square. If we put the quotient above into a program, as in this python code snipet: N = 1000

for n in range(1,N):
    for m in range(n+1, N):
        A = (n*n + m*m + 1)*(n*n + m*m - 1)
        B = 2*m*n*(n+m)*(m-n)
        if A % B == 0:
            print(A/B) The quotient always is 2, regardless of whether or not $n$ and $m$ are co prime! So if the very strong implication $2mn(n+m)(n-m) \mid (n^2 + m^2 + 1)(n^2 + m^2 - 1) \implies \frac{(n^2 + m^2 + 1)(n^2 + m^2 - 1)}{2mn(n+m)(n-m)} = 2$ holds, then the original problem will be solved.","['number-theory', 'contest-math', 'vieta-jumping', 'elementary-number-theory']"

So how do we go about choosing a standard smooth structure to work with and do calculations with? How can we justify any of the uncountably many choices as the "" best "" one? Context: My confusion is a result of solving the following problem (i.e. my solution raises more questions than it answers) from Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds , 1-6 on p.30: Let $M$ be a nonempty topological manifold of dimension $n \ge 1$ . If $M$ has a smooth structure, show that it has uncountably many distinct ones. [Hint: first show that for any $s>0$, $F_s(x)=|x|^{s-1}x$ defines a homeomorphism from $\mathbb{B}^n$ to itself, which is a diffeomorphism if and only if $s=1$.] This answer and this question both seem to imply that all of these smooth structures should be diffeomorphic, but if they were diffeomorphic, then wouldn't the smoothness of transition maps between coordinate charts imply that they are equal (since any smoothness structure is a maximal atlas)? Anyway, even if they were all diffeomorphic, that still doesn't resolve the issue of which one should be the ""standard"" one and which one to choose for calculations, etc. For example, on p. 40 of this same book, it says that: ...$\mathbb{R}^4$ has uncountably many distinct smooth structures, no two of which are diffeomorphic to each other! The existence of nonstandard smooth structures on $\mathbb{R}^4$ (called fake $\mathbb{R}^4$'s ) was first proved by Simon Donaldson and Michael Freedman in 1984 as a consequence of their work on the geometry and topology of compact 4-manifolds... So when working with $\mathbb{R}^4$, how does one decide which smooth structure is the ""standard"" smooth structure, and how can someone verify that they are working with the correct smooth structure? My attempt: Does the answer have to do with the fact that any topological manifold already comes pre-equipped with a collection of charts which are appropriate homeomorphisms but not necessarily smoothly compatible with each other, and thus any smooth structure is a strict subset of the family of charts inherited from the topological manifold structure? Such that any two distinct smooth structures are both strict subsets of the family of charts from the underlying topological manifold? So they are necessarily equivalent up to homeomorphism? I still don't see how to show that they are equivalent up to diffeomorphism. Also the fact that any smooth structure on a set induces a topological manifold structure on the same set would seem to suggest that any smooth atlas is not strictly contained in the family of charts resulting only from the topology of the underlying space, although I am not sure either way.","['differential-topology', 'smooth-manifolds', 'soft-question', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

It seems natural to ask whether the same is true for addition of matrices instead of product. For $1\times1$ matrices (i.e., numbers), the only singular matrix is $0$ ; so if we add it to any nonsingular (invertible) matrix, it remains nonsingular.

1993338,"An $F$-open set, which is affine, is an affine $F$-variety.","I have a subtle question about varieties.  I've been trying to make sense out of this stuff for over a year.  My references are the two books both called Linear Algebraic Groups by Springer and Borel. Here is the nonintrinsitic situation: Let $X$ be a closed set in $\mathbb{A}^n$, and suppose that the ideal $I$ corresponding to $X$ is generated by polynomials with coefficients in $F$.  Then the coordinate ring $k[X] = k[T_1, ... , T_n]/I$ acquires an ""$F$-structure,"" which is to say an $F$-subalgebra, namely $$F[X] := F[T_1, ... , T_n]/I \cap F[T_1, ... , T_n]$$ which is finitely generated and when tensored with $k$ over $F$ becomes $k[X]$.  We acquire on $X$ a subtopology of ""$F$-open sets"" i.e. subsets of $X$ whose complement in $X$ is the zero set of some collection of polynomials in $F[X]$.  To each $F$-open set $U$ in $X$, it is possible to define an $F$-subalgebra $\mathcal O_X^F(U)$ (not necessarily finitely generated over $F$) of $\mathcal O_X(U)$ which when tensored with $k$ over $F$ becomes $\mathcal O_X(U)$, in such a way that if we identify $\mathcal O_X(X)$ with $k[X]$, $\mathcal O_X^F(X)$ is just $F[X]$. Here is the intrinsic situation: An affine $k$-algebra with $F$-structure is a finitely generated, reduced $k$-algebra $A$, together with a finitely generated $F$-subalgebra $A_0$, such that $A = k \otimes_F A_0$.  The corresponding variety $X = \textrm{Spm } A$ acquires the structure of an affine $F$-variety , which means the following: 1 .  A subtopology of $F$-open sets of $X$, namely an open set $U \subseteq X$ is $F$-open if and only if $X - U$ is the zero set of an ideal which is extended from $A_0$ (which is a weaker assertion than the ideal corresponding to $X - U$ itself being extended from $A_0$!). 2 .  On each $F$-open set $U$ in $X$, an $F$-subalgebra $\mathcal O_X^F(U)$ of $\mathcal O_X(U)$ (not necessarily finitely generated over $F$) defined as follows: let $U = D(f_1) \cup \cdots \cup D(f_m)$ be any open cover of $U$ by principal $F$-open sets , i.e. $f_i \in A_0$.  Each localized ring $A_f = \mathcal O_X (D(f))$ has a finitely generated $F$-subalgebra $(A_0)_f$ which when tensored with $k$ over $F$ becomes $A_f$.  Noting that $D(f_i) \cap D(f_j) = D(f_if_j)$, the sheaf condition gives us an exact sequence $$ 0 \rightarrow \mathcal O_X(U) \xrightarrow{\phi} \prod\limits_i A_{f_i} \xrightarrow{\psi} \prod\limits_{i,j} A_{f_if_j}$$ and $\mathcal O_X^F(U)$ is defined as the preimage under $\phi$ of $\prod\limits_i (A_0)_{f_i}$. This definition of $\mathcal O_X^F(U)$ is independent of the choice of cover, and in particular we have $\mathcal O_X^F(D(f)) = (A_0)_f$ for $f \in A_0$ and $\mathcal O_X^F(X) = A_0$.  We also have $\mathcal O_X(U) = k \otimes_F \mathcal O_X^F(U)$.  Then $\mathcal O_X^F$ is a sheaf on $X$ with the topology of $F$-open sets.  $\blacksquare$ One can define a morphism of affine $F$-varieties in a natural way, so that the category of ""affine $k$-algebras with $F$-structure"" is antiequivalent to that of affine $F$-varieties. Now, here's my question.  Let $(X, \mathcal O_X)$ be an affine $F$-variety (as defined above), and suppose that $U$ is an $F$-open set which happens to be affine. Can we say that the affine variety $(U, \mathcal O_{X|U})$ is naturally an affine $F$-variety? Ideally I would want these things to happen: 1 .  $\mathcal O_X^F(U)$ is finitely generated as an $F$-algebra.  (so that $(U,\mathcal O_{X|U})$ acquires the structure of an affine $F$-algebra via the ring $\mathcal O_X^F(U)$, and in particular acquires rings $\mathcal O_{X|U}^F(V)$ for every $F$-open subset $V$ of $U$, such that $\mathcal O_{X|U}^F(U) = \mathcal O_X^F(U)$) and assuming (1) holds, 2 .  An open set $V \subseteq U$ is $F$-open in $U$ if and only if it is $F$-open in $X$ and assuming (1) and (2) hold, 3 .  $\mathcal O_X^F(V) = \mathcal O_{X|U}^F(U)$ These three conditions seem to be a tacit assumption by both Borel and Springer in their books.  For example, on page 13 of Springer, he writes in the definition of an arbitrary $F$-variety ""an affine $F$-open set has the structure of an affine $F$-variety."" However, even condition 1 seems like it need not hold.  In general, if $A_0$ is an $F$-algebra, just because $k \otimes_F A_0$ is finitely generated as a $k$-algebra does not mean that $A_0$ is finitely generated as an $F$-algebra (e.g. if $k$ has infinite transcendence degree over $F$, take $A_0 = F[x_i]$ where $x_i$ is a transcendence basis for $k/F$).",['algebraic-geometry']
