894810,How to understand the combination formula?,"I'm reading an algorithm book. In which it mentioned: Imagine (once again) you have n people lined up to see a movie, but
  there are only k places left in  the theater. How many possible
  subsets of size k could possibly get in? That’s exactly $C(n,k)$, of
  course,  and the metaphor may do some work for us here. We already
  know that we have $n!$ possible orderings of  the entire line. What if
  we just count all these possibilities and let in the first $k$? The only
  problem then is  that we’ve counted the subsets too many times. A
  certain group of k friends could stand at the head of  the line in a
  lot of the permutations; in fact, we could allow these friends to
  stand in any of their $k!$  possible permutations, and the remainder of
  the line could stand in any of their $(n–k)!$ possible  permutations
  without affecting who’s getting in. Aaaand this gives us the answer! $$C(n,k)= \frac{n!}{k!(n −k)!}$$ This formula just counts all possible permutations of the line (n!),
  and divides by the number of  times we count each “winning subset,” as
  explained. I'm not quite understand why the reminder can in any $(n-k)!$ permutation, if he stands at the end of the queue, won't he let all these people in? 
And why I should use $n!$ to divide by $k!(n-k)!$ ? Didn't see that consequence from the metaphor. If you have better ideas to explain this formula, you can use them of course.",['combinatorics']

There are many solutions to this on this site where the two variables have the same range ( density of sum of two uniform random variables $[0,1]$ ) but I don't understand how to translate them to the case where one variable have a different range. Here's what I tried: $$f_Z(z)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x)f_Y(z-x)\,dx.$$ We will have $f_Z(z)=0$ for $z\lt \frac{1}{2}$, and also for $z\ge 2$.
Two cases (i) $\frac{1}{2}\lt z\le 1$ and (ii) $1\lt z\lt 2$. (i) In order to have $f_Y(z-x)=1$, we need $z-x\ge 0$, that is, $x\le z$. So for (i), we will be integrating from $x=\frac{1}{2}$ to $x=z$.
$$f_Z(z)=\int_\frac{1}{2}^z 2 * 1\,dx=2z-1.$$
for $\frac{1}{2}\lt z\le 1$. (ii) Suppose that $1\lt z\lt 2$. In order to have $f_Y(z-x)$ to be $1$, we need $z-x\le 1$, that is, we need $x\ge z-1$.
$$f_Z(z)=\int_{z-1}^1 2*1\,dx=4-2z.$$

895086,"Rank, degree and slope of a general coherent sheaf","Let $(X,\mathcal O_X)$ be a ringed space and $\mathcal F$ be a coherent sheaf of $\mathcal O_X$-modules on $(X,\mathcal O_X)$. Are there the definitions of rank, degree and slope of $\mathcal F$ in this general situation? I've seen only definitions for different particular cases. For example, if $X$ is a projective algebraic variety together with an embedding $X \to \mathbb P^N$ and with $\dim X = \dim \mathcal F = d$ then one defines first the Hilbert polynomial
$$
   P(\mathcal F,m) = \chi(\mathcal F \otimes \mathcal O(m)) \equiv \sum_{i=0}^{d} \alpha_i(\mathcal F) \frac{m^i}{i!},

Another special case is when $X$ is a compact Kahler manifold with the Kahler form $\omega$ and $\mathcal F$ is a torsion-free holomorphic vector bundle, when $\rank \mathcal F$ is the rank of the vector bundle and
$$
   \deg \mathcal F = \int\limits_X c_1(\mathcal F) \wedge \omega^{n-1}.

I.e. using the union symbol ( ∪ ) 2) The next thing I want to know is how I can expand the statement using a more generic symbolic language where I am forced also to replace ∪ with its axiomatic definitions assuming that I understand logic and share the assumption that things can exist. I assume that this is possible as I understand the ZFC is built on axiomatic reasoning on top of some simple assumptions shared by most mammals (things can exist etc. etc.). The reason I'm asking is that I find Set Theory appealing to begin to learn the language you guys use (i.e. mathematics).

For the difference in colours, I simply meant that I could identify each apple as being two different things in existence. The notion of them both being apples is because it would make sense that I would be able to expand 2 into a set representing both apples and then expand it into the complete rigorous axiomatic definition of the set using only formal logic and the assumption that two items actually exist as separate identifiable entities.","['discrete-mathematics', 'elementary-set-theory', 'first-order-logic']"

After I do that I add standard deviation to my average to get the upper limit . And also take away standard deviation from the average to get bottom limit . And then finally check if that value is outside the range. That's a quick sketch: /\                  /\/\

It leads to a problem of what to do if $S = \emptyset$. This case is handled separately by defining $\bigcap S = \emptyset$. Why don't they just define $\bigcap S := \{x \in \bigcup S |$ $x$ belongs to every member of $S\}$. Then if $S$ is empty, $\bigcup S$ will be empty and there is nothing to separate from it.

A typical example is: $$ \mathbb{C}[X,XY,XY^2] \cong \frac{\mathbb{C}[U,V,W]}{\langle V^2 - UW \rangle}. $$ I would like a nice way to write the Kahler differentials of such rings. For example when we have the following ring: $$  \mathbb{C}[X^{ \pm 1}] \cong A := \frac{\mathbb{C}[U,V]}{\langle UV \rangle} $$
There is already a nice way of writing the differential - $d(f(X)) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial X} dX $ but also all $\ f(U,V) + \langle UV \rangle \ \in A \ $ can be written uniquely as $h(U) + g(V) + \langle UV \rangle $ for polynomials $h$ and $g$. Then we can write something like: $d( f(U,V) + \langle UV \rangle )  =  (\frac{\partial h}{\partial U} +\langle UV \rangle)dU + (\frac{\partial g}{\partial V} + \langle UV \rangle)dV + \langle d(UV)\rangle$ Note this is equivalent to the standard way to write the differential. Can this be generalized? For example can I do this with the first example I gave? really this is me trying to just  get a nice way to write these maps, as they behave a lot like the standard way of writing the Kahler differential  but the notation means i can't write $\frac{\partial f}{\partial X} $ for example.","['complex-geometry', 'ring-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"

895402,Standard spaces with non-standard topology and around,"The following series of questions gives me no rest. Let $\mathbb{\widetilde{R}}^n$ be $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Zariski topology, i.e. we say that $A\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is closed if it is given by the system of polynomial equations. What are the topological properties of $\mathbb{\widetilde{R}}^n$? Especially, what are singular (co)homologies of this space? Is it still contractible as $\mathbb{R}^n$ with usual topology? We may go further and consider subspaces of $\mathbb{\widetilde{R}}^n$ with induced topology. For example, let $\iota:M_g\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3$ be some embedding of surface of genus $g$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$. Denote $M^{\iota}_g$ the space $\iota(M_g)$ with topology induced from $\mathbb{\widetilde{R}}^3$. First, does it depend on the embedding $\iota$? And second what are singular (co)homologies of $M^{\iota}_g$? I would like to emphasize that I am least interested in the answer (as though it is also very interesting), but rather in technique of calculation of (co)homologies of such spaces. For example, $M^{\iota}_g$ is no more CW-complex and calculations via cellular
complex are impossible. In a sense, we can go in the opposite direction and consider $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by a system of polynomials. As I understand in this situation $A$ is called algebraic variety over $\mathbb{R}$. The natural topology on $A$ is Zariski topology but we want to act like perverts, so we induce the topology on $A$ from usual $\mathbb{R}^n$. What can be said about (co)homologies (and more important about tools of their calculation) of these spaces? Especially, is it possible to say something about (co)homologies looking only on polynomials defining $A$ (I doubt, of course)? It seems that foundamental algebraic topology books (Fomenko-Fuks, Hatcher) are based on standard topology of $\mathbb{R}$, so when I thought about some monstrous (but kind of natural in some cases) topologies I realized that I know nothing about them. So, any references are welcome. Edit. Singular chains are maps $f: \Delta^k \rightarrow\mathbb{\widetilde{R}}^n$, where $k$ is dimension of the corresponding simplex, however, if this simplex has induced topology from $\mathbb{R}^k$ (not $\mathbb{\widetilde{R}}^k$) then obviously $C_i(\mathbb{R}^n)\subset C_i(\mathbb{\widetilde{R}}^n)$ (because Zariski topology is included in usual topology). However, at the moment I cannot give an example of mapping $f:\Delta^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ which would be continitous in Zariski sense and discontinious in usual sense, I think this is also interesting question. Another thought in this direction, what will happen if one considers $\widetilde{\Delta}^k$ (Zariski topology on simplex) instead of $\Delta^k$. It leads to something that may be reasonably called Zariski-singular (co)homology theory. I just made it all up, so I would be all the way greatful to somebody who can review and say, does it all make any sense?","['general-topology', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"

$$\tilde{y}_t=\ell_t=\alpha y_{t-1} + (1-\alpha)y_{t-2}.$$
Performing the necessary calculations we can derive the formula
$$\alpha = \cfrac{ \sum_{t=2}^N(y_{t}-y_{t-2})(y_{t-1}-y_{t-2})}{ \sum_{t=2}^N (y_{t-1}-y_{t-2})^2}.$$
Exponential smoothing can be upgraded to a method that takes trends into account, this is the so-called Holt's linear trend method and is given by the following expressions:
$$\begin{array}{l}
\tilde{y}_{t+h} = \ell_t + hb_t, \\
\ell_t = \alpha y_{t-1} + (1-\alpha)(\ell_{t-2} + b_{t-2}),\\
b_t=\beta(\ell_t-\ell_{t-1})+(1-\beta)b_{t-2}.
\end{array}$$
In order to estimate the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, all the literature I've been able to read suggests to follow the same path as with regular exponential smoothing, that is, minimizing the squared error, but none does actually give any insights on the process. This is where I decided to try it myself, taking the same approach: we consider a one-step forecast model, so $h=1$ and the equations are thus given by
$$\begin{array}{l}
\tilde{y}_{t} = \ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1}, \\
\ell_{t-1} = \alpha y_{t-1} + (1-\alpha)(2y_{t-2} - y_{t-1}),\\
b_{t-1}=\beta(\ell_{t-1}-y_{t-2})+(1-\beta)(y_{t-2}-y_{t-1}).
\end{array}$$
More precissely, we are considering $\ell_{t-2} = y_{t-2}$ and $b_{t-2} = y_{t-2}-y_{t-1}$ ($b_t$ is meant to be the slope of the straight line going through the last couple of points before the forecast one). Minimizing the squred error now requires performing multi-variable optimization, so taking both derivatives and equalising to zero I get, after many calculations, the following formula:
$$\beta = \frac{ \sum_{t=3}^N (2y_{t-2}-y_{t-3}-y_{t-1})(3y_{t-2}-2y_{t-3}-y_t)}{\alpha \sum_{t=3}^N (y_{t-1}-2y_{t-2}+y_{t-3})^2} - 1.$$
Now, the problem here is that I get the same expression for both derivatives, namely that both
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha} \sum_{t=3}^N e_t^2 = 0$$
and
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \sum_{t=3}^N e_t^2 = 0$$
will lead to the same formula, implying that the system has infinitely many solutions and that there is actually a whole curve of minima. Personally, I find this hard to believe but no matter how much I look to my computations I won't find any mistakes. My question is if my reasoning is correct and if somebody could verify my approach. In case that this is indeed correct, would it be reasonable to estimate $\alpha$ as if in regular exponential smoothing and then use this parameter to estimate a $\beta$ for Holt's method?

895561,A real analytic function that takes each value in $\mathbb{R}$ three times,"I was inspired by this question : it is quite easy to prove that for any positive odd number $2m+1$ there exists a function $f\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ such that $$\left|\,f^{-1}(y)\right|=2m+1\tag{1}$$ for any $y\in\mathbb{R}$. My (double) question now is: 1) Is it possible that $(1)$ holds for a real-analytic function ? 2) Is it possible that $(1)$ holds for an entire real function ? I am quite sure that the answer to the second point is negative. If we take $x_M$ as a point of local maximum ad $x_m$ as a point of local minimum, there must be $z_M,z_m\in\mathbb{R}$ with the properties that $f(z_M)=f(x_M),f(z_m)=f(x_m)$ and neither $z_m$ or $z_M$ are stationary points. If we prove that  $f^{(k)}(z_m)=f^{(k)}(z_M)$ for any $k\geq 1$, then  $g(z)=f'(z+z_m)-f'(z+z_M)\equiv 0$, so $f'$ is a $(z_M-z_m)$-periodic function. By translation, we can assume: 
$$z_m=-1,\quad z_M=1,\quad f(z_m)=-1,\quad f(z_M)=1,$$
and have a $2$-periodic function with the property that $f(\xi)\in\{-1,1\}$ for any $\xi\in[-1,1]$ such that $f'(\xi)=0$. So $f$ should be $(T_{2m+1}\circ\varphi)(x)$ with $T$ being a Chebyshev polynomial and $\varphi$ being a diffeomorphism of $[-1,1]$. But for such a function $f''(1)=-f''(1)\neq 0$. However, there are too many "" maybe "" and "" should "" in this argument, and above all, it does not fit the real analytic case.","['functions', 'analyticity', 'real-analysis']"

(letting $ \ I = \  \langle V^2 - UV\rangle  \ \ $) Now, assuming what I have above is ok, we have $ \langle d(V^2-UW) \rangle  \  = \langle  2V\, dV - W\,dU - U\,dW \rangle  $ So ($U$ affine etc) :

I know we should end up with $H^0_{dR}(U) \cong \mathbb{C} $, but these maps are pretty confusing, especially now as our generators are no longer independent thanks to the new relation we've introduced. My questions are: 1) is what i've done above correct so far? 2) if it is, then how would one go about showing  $H^0_{dR}(U) \cong \mathbb{C} $ continuing what i've done above? (this can be just a hint in the right direction if you want) EDIT: I've looked through the suggested MO thread, and commented below on it. It provides a good proof of (2) using a more general method. I would still like to get at it through this calculation if that's possible. EDIT 2: Also I tried this earlier; is this be correct for the ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/\langle xy \rangle $ ?: Suppose $\frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x} dx + \frac{ \partial f}{ \partial y} dy \in \langle ydx + xdy \rangle $ (working in $ \Omega^1_{\mathbb{C}[x,y]} $) Now $ \exists g \in \mathbb{C[x,y]} \ \ \frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x} = yg(x,y) \ , \frac{ \partial f}{ \partial y} = xg(x,y)$ Choose $G_x(x,y) \ , \ G_y(x,y)$ such that $\frac{ \partial G_x}{ \partial x} = g \ , \ \frac{ \partial G_y}{ \partial y} = g$. Now we see $f = yG_x + H_1(y) $ and $ f = xG_y + H_2(x) $ for some $H_1,H_2$ without loss of generality then $G_x$ is divisible by $x$ and similarly $y | G_y$. Then we see $H_1(y) = f = H_2(x) $ (since $xy=0$), so $H_1,H_2$ (and hence also $f$) constant. I realize I've argued this fairly loosely and it could do with more rigour. EDIT...4?: David below has pointed out that this calculation will not give me what I want. I would still like to know a sketch of the method that should be used to find kernels and images of linear maps like this, because it's this which I find tough. I guess the situation I am thinking about is: $ \phi : \ V \rightarrow W$, where $V,W$ are infinite dimensional $\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces and in general do not have a basis, (but the case where $V$ has a basis is also important) and where we know all the relations imposed on $V,W$.

x!y!-x!-y!+1 &= 3\\
\left(x!-1\right)\left(y!-1\right) &= 3=1\times 3 = 3\times 1

$$ So, without loss of generality, $(x!-1)=1$ and $(y!-1)=3$, which implies that  $x!=2$ and $y!=4$. But there is no $y\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $y!=4$. Thus no ordered pairs $(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z^2}$ exist which satisfy the given equation. Is this solution correct? If not, why not?",['algebra-precalculus']

896023,Almost all subgroups of a Lie group are free,"I am currently reading this paper by Epstein. I need help with understanding the proof. Specifically, I have the following two questions. Let $w\colon G\to H$ be an analytic mapping between connected Lie groups $G$ and $H$. How do we prove that the preimage of a point is either the whole of $G$ or has Haar measure zero in $G$?
The paper says one should take $G$ to be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$ and use induction on $m$ and Fubini's theorem, but this doesn't really convince me (I cannot fill the details). The whole paper seems to assume that $G$ is analytic manifold, whereas the usual assumption is that Lie group is smooth manifold. Does this mean that the result of the paper hold only for real-analytic Lie groups, or this assumption is not actually a restriction and in some way we also have the claim for the classical real Lie groups? Edit: Actually, regarding (1), I don't see why the usual $t\in\mathbb{R}\mapsto e^{-1/t^2}1_{t>0}\in\mathbb{R}$ is not a counterexample.","['measure-theory', 'lie-groups', 'manifolds']"

896041,Calculating the best match between two sets,"I’m a PHP developer and I have a problem calculating the perfect match between two different data sets. I have data sets from companies, where each company defines the requirements for a specific job. I also have data sets from users, where each user can define a data set describing their skills. Both of this datasets could hold values between $1$ and $12$. Here’s an example of two data sets: $\begin{align*}
\text{Company} & \to [\phantom{1}4, \phantom{1}8, 12, \phantom{1}4, 10] \\
\text{User} & \to [\phantom{1}8, 10, \phantom{1}5, \phantom{1}5, \phantom{0}1]

There were two thoughts that crossed my mind, but I don’t know which would be better, of if indeed there’s another completely different approach. Calculate the sum of all absolute diffs. $\newcommand{\abs}{\operatorname{abs}}$ For example:
$$\text{score} = \abs(4-8) + \abs(8-10) + \abs(12-5) + \abs(4-5) + \abs(10-1) = 23$$ Calculate the absolute diff between the sum of both data sets. For example:

$$
\{\varnothing, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{4\}, \{2, 3\}, \{1, 4\}\}

$$
\{\varnothing, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{4\}, \{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}\}
$$
(since the last two sides of this one intersect in one vertex). If $n=3$, there are 5 of them (while the Dedekind number for 3 is 20). They are: - dim=2
$$\{\varnothing, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{2, 3\}, \{1, 2, 3\}\}$$
- dim=1
$$\{\varnothing, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{2, 3\}\}$$
$$\{\varnothing, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}\}$$
$$\{\varnothing, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1, 2\}\}$$
- dim 0
$$\{\varnothing, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}\}$$ Since this last observation I think that the answer is not the Dedekind number, but please prove me wrong if you think it is. Thank you in advance,

896119,Using Fourier Series to compute sums,"I have just started learning the basics of Fourier series and have some doubts about it. I am aware that Fourier series can be used to compute infinite sums. For example, $\zeta(2)$ and $\eta(2)$ can be evaluated by using the Fourier series expansion of $x^2$, where $x\in[-\pi, \pi]$.
$$x^2=\frac{\pi^2}{3}+\sum_{n \ge 1}\frac{4(-1)^n}{n^2}\cos{nx}$$
Letting $x=\pi$ and $x=0$ will yield the required results. This then brings me to my question. Given a sum to compute, how does one determine the appropriate $f(x)$ and $L$? For example, given a sum like
$$\beta(3)=\sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)^3}$$
, may I ask how we are supposed to know which function we have to consider? Also, I am interested in knowing how to apply this technique to evaluate sums of the more general form
$$\sum_{n \ge 0}\frac{z^n}{(n+a)^s}$$
