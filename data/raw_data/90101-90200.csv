1210553,Upper Lebesgue sum with a new partition,"Assume we have a $f$ from  $R$ to  $[0, \infty)$, which is Lebesgue integrable. Show that there exists a sequence of bi-infinite partitions $Y_n$ of the $y$-axis for which the Lebesgue upper sum is finite and converge to $\int f$ as $n$ goes to $\infty$. The bi-infinite partition is defined as $Y$= $\left\{y_i: 0 < ...< y_{i-1} <y_i<..., \right\}$, with $y_i$ goes to $0$ as $i$ goes to $-\infty$ and $y_i$ goes to $\infty$ as $i$ goes to $\infty$. So how to construct the sequence of the bi-infinite partition? And how is such construction related to the $\liminf$ of the upper Legesgue sum? $***EDIT***$: Here is the question, from Pugh's Real Mathematical Analysis: Do your think whether such sequence of partitions work? $Y_1$=$\left\{y_i=i,  y_{-i}=1/2^i \right\}$ And we add $k/2^m$, where $k<2^m$, $m\leqslant n$ to the negative index part, and for the positive part we add $1+q$ for $Y_2$, and $1+q, 2+q$ for $Y_3$, and so on and so forth, where $q$ is rationals between 0 and 1. My guess is that by doing so, we are letting $y_i+1/y_i$ to approach 1 when $n$ is sufficiently large, which makes the Lebesgue upper sum approaching to the lower sum, and thus to the Lebesgue Integral.","['proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory']"
1210557,Parallel lines divide a circle's area into thirds,"When I was young I came up with a geometry problem and drew it in a notebook: Suppose we have a circle with radius $r$ and area $A$. Let two parallel lines be equidistant from the center of the circle and divide the circle's area into thirds. What is the distance $d$ between these two lines? (Note: the following work contains the laughable mistake of solving $\int \sqrt{x^2-r^2} \; dx$ instead of $\int \sqrt{r^2-x^2} \; dx$. I'll go ahead and leave my work anyway:) Later on, in high school, I found the notebook again and used my new calculus  tools to approach the problem, which I recorded on the next few pages of that notebook. I recognized that
$$\frac{1}{12}A=\frac{1}{12}(\pi r^2)=\int_0^{d/2} \sqrt{x^2-r^2}\; dx$$
$$=\frac{x}{2}\sqrt{x^2-r^2}-\frac{r^2}{2}\ln \left|x+\sqrt{x^2-r^2}\right|\biggl|_0^{d/2}$$
$$= \frac{d}{4}\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}d^2-r^2} -\frac{r^2}{2}\left[ \ln\left|{\frac{d}{2}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}d^2-r^2}} \right| -\ln\left|\sqrt{-r^2} \right| \right] $$
But we know that $$\frac{1}{4}d^2-r^2<0$$The final equation I wrote down was
$$r^2= \frac{3d}{\pi}i\sqrt{r^2-\frac{1}{4}d^2} -\frac{6r^2}{\pi}\left[ \ln\left|{\frac{d}{2}+i\sqrt{r^2-\frac{1}{4}d^2}} \right| -\ln\left|ir\right| \right] $$
and this is where I probably slammed the notebook shut in frustration. I'm more mathematically mature now (college student) and want to finally get an answer to this problem. There are probably a few different ways to approach this problem. I found a version of this problem on MSE here , but mine is the particular case $n=2$. Can anybody help me put this decade-old problem to rest? I mainly posted this because I want to know if there is some elegant solution out there to this seemingly simple problem (e.g. solution without numerical methods).","['geometry', 'numerical-methods']"
1210572,Find the distance to the edge of a hexagon,"I'm trying to make a nice graphical gimmick for my game, but for it to work I need to find a way to get the distance from the center of a hexagon to it's edge, based on the angle. For example, if I'd draw a line from the center to the edge at an angle of 5 degrees, how long would that line be? And what would it be when I draw a line at 45 degrees?

1210580,trigonometry of interfering waves,"I have a book which makes the following claim: $$ A \cos( \omega t + \phi ) = A_1 \cos( \omega t + \phi_1 ) + A_2 \cos( \omega t + \phi_2 ) $$ ...where: $$ A^2 = A_1^2 + A_2^2 + 2 A_1 A_2 \cos( \phi_1 - \phi_2 ) $$ ...and: $$ \tan( \phi ) = \frac{ A_1 \sin( \phi_1 ) + A_2 \sin( \phi_2 ) }{ A_1 \cos( \phi_1 ) + A_2 \cos( \phi_2 ) } $$ However, I've been unable to derive this set of relations, and I've used every trig identity I've been able to think of.  Either I'm missing something, or there's a simplifying assumption or approximation the author is making that they aren't explicitly stating. If it helps at all, this is a book about optics (specifically: holography), and these formulas are being used to describe the interference of spherical wavefronts of light from two point sources.  The original sources $O_1$ and $O_2$ have phases $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, respectively, and at the point of measurement $M$ the phase of the resulting wavefront is $\phi$ (and $\omega$ is the same throughout).  The amplitues of the waves at $M$, from $O_1$, and from $O_2$ are $A$, $A_1$, and $A_2$, respectively. Additionally, we have: $\omega = 2 \pi \nu$ and $k = 2 \pi / \lambda$, where $\nu$ is frequency and $\lambda$ is wavelength; and we also have $ \phi_1 = \phi_{01} - k r_1 $ and $ \phi_2 = \phi_{02} - k r_2 $, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the distances to $M$ from $O_1$ and $O_2$, respectively, and $\phi_{01}$ and $\phi_{02}$ are the initial phases at those same sources.  Though I'm not sure how relevant this last group of quantities is to the part of the problem I'm stuck on. Am I trying too hard to find an exact solution?  Is this really just an approximation? I'd like to post photographs of the relevant pages in the book, but I'm not sure whether that complies with site policy (or more importantly, with copyright law - does it constitute fair-use?).

So I think probably here the result of Lebesgue integral is different. But how to compute the iterated integral using Lebesgue integral? The domain are split equally into 2 squares in the unit box if using Riemann integral. Do we still have this in Lebesgue integral?

1210651,Product of affine varieties is the product of topological spaces,"Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, and $A, B$ affine $k$-algebras.  We can define a functor $\mathfrak F$ from the category of affine $k$-algebras to that of affine algebraic varieties, by making $Max(A)$ into a topological space (for $g \in A$, set $D(g)$ to be the set of $\mathfrak m \in Max(A)$ for which $g \not\in \mathfrak m$; this is a basis for a topology of which every open set is a finite union).  We then define a sheaf $\mathcal O_A$ on $Max(A)$ in a natural way, and obtain the affine $k$-algebra $(Max(A), \mathcal O_A) = \mathfrak F(A)$. I know how to prove that the functor $\mathfrak F$ induces an antiequivalence of categories.  I know that the tensor product $A \otimes_k B$ is a coproduct in the category of affine $k$-algebras, so it follows that $\mathfrak F(A \otimes_k B)$ is a product in the category of affine varieties.  But I have also read that the cartesian product $Max(A) \times Max(B)$, along with the natural projections onto $Max(A), Max(B)$, can serve as the underlying set (usually not in the product topology) of the product of affine varieties $\mathfrak F(A)$ and $\mathfrak F(B)$.  Is there an easy way to see this? I'm trying to do things as ""categorically"" as possible, in particular avoiding noncanonical descriptions of affine $k$-algebras (as quotients of polynomial rings by radical ideals) where I can.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.","['algebraic-geometry', 'affine-geometry', 'sheaf-theory']"

1210721,How to maximize the number of operations in process,"In my research project I have encountered the following problem, concerning a tuple of words in the formal language $L=\{0,1\}^*$, with $\epsilon$ denoting the empty word. If we are given an ordered triple of words  $(a,b,c)$, an operation on that tuple consists of replacing one of the $x\in\{a,b,c\}$ by $x0,\ x1,$ or $y$ such that $x\neq y\in\{a,b,c\}$, e.g:
$$(\epsilon,\epsilon,\epsilon)\xrightarrow{b:=b1}(\epsilon,1,\epsilon)\xrightarrow{b:=b0}(\epsilon,10,\epsilon)\xrightarrow{c:=c1}(\epsilon,10,1)\xrightarrow{a:=b}(10,10,1) $$
Given a non-negative integer $h$, we say that $(a,b,c)$ is $h$-complete if the length of each of $a,b,c$ is $h$, that is $|a|=|b|=|c|=h$. We say that a series of operations is healthy if and only any tuple $(a,b,c)$ appears at most once. For example, the sequence
$$(\epsilon,\epsilon,\epsilon)\xrightarrow{b:=b0}(\epsilon,1,\epsilon)\xrightarrow{ b:=c}(\epsilon,\epsilon,\epsilon)$$
is not healthy because $(\epsilon,\epsilon,\epsilon)$ appears twice. The length of a tuple $(a,b,c)$ is defined as $|(a,b,c)|=\max(|a|,|b|,|c|)$ My question: What is the maximum number of healthy operations in a sequence which can transform $(\epsilon,\epsilon,\epsilon)$ into an $h$-complete tuple with all the intermediate tuples have length less than or equal to $h$ The minimum number of operations is $h+2$, but I'm interested in the worst case, and my problem consists of a generalization for $n$ words and not just $3$. If you know any references for such problems, or have any idea about this problem, it will be appreciated! Edit : the answer for couples is $f_2(h)=\frac{(h+2)(h+1)}{2}-1$ when we are taking pairs $(x,y)$ instead of $3$-tuples $(a,b,c)$ If $h=1$ there is only two operations which can transform $(\epsilon,\epsilon)$ to $(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)$ so:
$$f_2(1)=2 $$ Suppose that there is only that the result is true for $h$ given two words of lenght $|x|=|y|=h+1$ my idea is described by the following process:
$$(\epsilon,\epsilon)\underbrace{-------\rightarrow}_{m(h) \text{ operations}} \begin{Bmatrix}
(0,0)\\
(0,1)\\ 
(1,0)\\ 
(0,0) \\
(w,w') \big/ |w|\text{or }|w'|>1
\end{Bmatrix}\underbrace{-------\rightarrow}_{x(h) \text{ operations}}  (x,y)$$
the added intermediate step is necessary (we can not complete the process without passing throught it) and one can prove that : $m(h)\leq h+2$ and clearly $x(h)\leq f_2(h)$ so:
$$f_2(h+1)\leq f_2(h)+h+2$$
to complete the proof we have to construct a process with $f_2(h+1)=h+2+f_2(h)$ which can be done using the schema","['computer-science', 'computational-complexity', 'combinatorics']"
1210752,The completion of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra the same as the completion of the Lebesgue outer measure?,"My study group and I were discussing this question today. We can construct the Lebesgue measure using Caratheodory's extension theorem in the usual way: Given the function $F(x) = x$, we can construct a pre-measure $\mu_F$ associated with $F(x)$ defined on an algebra of ""intervals"" (Folland uses right-closed h-intervals); From this premeasure, we can induce an outer measure $\mu^*$ on the power-set of the reals; Using Caratheodory's extension theorem, the collection of $\mu^*$-measurable sets is a complete $\sigma$-algebra, and $\mu^*$ restricted to this $\sigma$-algebra is a complete measure. This complete $\sigma$-algebra is in some sense a ""big"" structure; it is certainly larger than the Borel sets, and it must contain all of the Lebesgue measurable sets. However, Folland provides a related Theorem: Theorem 1.14 Let $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$ be an algebra, $\mu_0$ a premeasure on $\mathcal{A}$, and $\mathcal{M}$ the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{A}$. There exists a measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal{M}$ whose restriction to $\mathcal{A}$ is $\mu_0$ -- namely, $\mu = \mu^*|_\mathcal{M}$, where $\mu^*$ is given by $$\mu^*(E) = \inf \left\{\sum_1^\infty \mu_0(A_j) : A_j \in \mathcal{A}, E \subset \bigcup_1^\infty A_j\right\}.$$ He then goes on to claim uniqueness. The proof of the theorem invokes Caratheodory, but there is a question that remains. I will try to make my thoughts clear: Caratheodory gives us a complete measure space, this structure is large. Theorem 1.14 as written tells us that we can use a premeasure on an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ to generate a measure on the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{A}$ -- this $\sigma$-algebra is not necessarily complete. In fact, this $\sigma$-algebra is just the Borel $\sigma$-algebra. We can complete the Borel $\sigma$-algebra to obtain the Lebesgue measurable sets. However, is the completion of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra the same thing as we get by just applying Caratheodory's extension theorem to the Lebesgue outer measure to directly obtain a complete $\sigma$-algebra? Or is this a ""bigger"" structure than the completion of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra?","['lebesgue-measure', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1210818,Are there number systems or rings in which not every number is a product of primes?,"I am reading through some number theory and abstract algebra books, and in the number theory books they all prove the theorem which states that every integer is a product of primes (irreducibles). In particular, in Hardy and Wright, they prove that every element in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[\rho]$ where $\rho:=e^{\frac{2}{3}\pi i}$ is a product of primes, where they define primes to be elements who are only divisible by themselves and the units of their ring. They prove it in a way which uses the norm function ($N(a+bi)=a^2+b^2$), and I believe the proof can be easily adapted to include any euclidean domain. This property (ability for every element to be written as a product of primes, not necessarily unique) seems so inherent to me, so I am wondering: are there any number systems or rings in which not every element can be written as a product of primes? Clarification: I am only talking about the non-units of a ring (that aren't 0). Units are not considered to be prime. $\mathbb{Q}$ satisfies this property because there are no non-units (except 0). Clarification 2: The answer given by Barry Smith was great in that it gave an example of a ring which was not a field but contained no primes so it had nonunit elements that were not products of primes, but I was really looking for a ring which contained primes/irreducibles and also contained elements that could not be expressed as a product of primes/irreducibles. My intuition states that this does not exist straightforwardly from the definition of prime/irreducible.

1210866,To Find $a$ such that $2^{1990} \equiv a\pmod {1990}$. [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : What is the remainder when $2^{1990}$ is divided by $1990$? (4 answers) Closed 9 years ago . To Find $a$ such that  $2^{1990} \equiv a\pmod {1990}$. $1990 = 2 \times 5 \times 199$. Now $a \equiv 0 \pmod {2}$, $a \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$ and $a \equiv 29 \pmod{199}$. Taking first two together we get $a \equiv 4 \pmod {10}$. $199x \equiv 1\pmod {10}$ has a solution $x =-1$ and $10x \equiv 1\pmod{199}$ has a solution $x = 20$. Thus using Chinese Remainder Theorem we have, $a \equiv 4(-1)199 + 29(20)10 \equiv 5004 \equiv 1024\pmod {1990}$. Thus our $a = 1024$. Is the solution correct?

1211510,Orbits of properly discontinuous actions,"Definition Let $G$ be a group and $X$ a topological space. Let $G\curvearrowright X$ by homeomorphisms. We call the action properly discontinuous if for all $x\in X$ there exists an open neighborhood $U\ni x$ such that for all $g\in G\smallsetminus\{1_G\}$ we have $gU\cap U=\varnothing$, $gU$ being the image of $U$ by the action of $G$, i.e. $gU=\{g\cdot x:x\in U\}$, having denoted the action by $\cdot$. Remark If $G\curvearrowright X$ is a properly discontinuous action, then its orbits are discrete and closed. That is what I have on  my Geometry 3 notes. I tried to prove the remark, whose proof was left as an exercise, and got stuck on the closed part. Let me show you what I have managed. Claim 1 The orbits are discrete, i.e. the subspace topology on the orbits is the discrete one. Which means all subsets of the orbits are open in the subspace topology the orbit inherits from $X$. Proof Let $x\in X$. There exists, by definition, a neighborhood $U\ni x$ such that if $g\neq1_G$, $gU\cap U=\varnothing$. This means $U\cap(G\cdot x)=\{x\}$, so $\{x\}$ is open in the orbit. The same line of thought can be conducted for any element of the orbit. Therefore, the orbit is discrete. $\hspace{1cm}\square$ Claim 2 If $X$ is not Hausdorff, I cannot prove the orbits are closed, since in general they are not. Proof If $X$ is not Hausdorff, there exists at least a couple of topologically indistinguishable points, i.e. there exist $x,y\in X$ such that if $U\ni x$ is a neighborhood of $x$, then $y\in U$, and viceversa. There can be no $g\in G$ such that $gx=y$, because we have the neighborhood in the definition which separates $x$ from the rest of the orbit, and if $y$ were in the same orbit as $x$ we would have a contradiction. Let me say this better. Suppose $y=gx$ for some $g\in G$. We know $g\neq1_G$ as $x\neq y$. But then there exists $U\ni x$ a neighborhood such that $gU\cap U=\varnothing$ for all $g\in G\smallsetminus\{1_G\}$, in particular for the element sending $x$ to $y$, let it be $\overline{g}$. But $y\in\overline{g}U$, and $x\in U$, so that would separate $x,y$, against the hypothesis of topological indistinguishability, since $x\mapsto\overline{g}x$ is a homeomorphism and thus $\overline{g}U$ is still open. But if there exist such two points, then $y$ is an accumulation point of $G\cdot x$ and viceversa, so $G\cdot x$ and $G\cdot y$ are not closed. $\hspace{2cm}\square$ Claim 3 If $x\in X$, and $y$ is an accumulation point of $G\cdot x$, that is for all neighborhoods $U\ni y$ there exists $g:gx\in U\smallsetminus\{y\}$, then $y\not\in G\cdot x$. Proof Suppose $y=\overline{g}x$ for $\overline{g}\in G$. By definition of p.d. actions, we can find a neighborhood $U\ni y$ such that $gU\cap U=\varnothing$ for all $g\in G\smallsetminus\{1_G\}$. This $U$ will contain at least a point $\tilde x$ of $G\cdot x$ different from $y$. $G$ is transitive over $G\cdot x$, so we can find $\tilde g:\tilde gy=\tilde x$. But then $\tilde gU\cap U\ni\tilde x$, against the definition of p.d. action. $\hspace{6cm}\square$ Claim 4 If $|G|<\infty$, then the orbits are closed. Proof If $|G|<\infty$, then $|G\cdot x|\leq|G|<\infty$. Since by now we have the hypothesis that $X$ is Hausdorff, as we have show above that the orbits are, in general, not closed in a non-Hausdorff space, we conclude that for all $g\in G,y\not\in G\cdot x$ there exist neighborhoods $U_g\ni gx,V_g\ni y$ such that $U_g\cap V_g=\varnothing$. Let $V=\bigcap_{g\in G}V_g$. This is a finite intersection of neighborhoods, so is still a neighborhood of $y$, and it is disjoint from the orbit since we have excluded every $gx$ from it. Btw, $gx$ is $g\cdot x$, so I'm implying the $\cdot$. So $y$ is in the interior of the orbit's complement, which is therefore open. $\hspace{11cm}\square$ And here is where I got stuck: with infinite groups. Problem If $G$ is infinite, how do I show that there cannot be a point $y\in X$ such that if $U\ni y$ is open, $U\cap(G\cdot x)\neq\varnothing,\{y\}$? For the moment, I have shown that if there exists such a $y$, besides being outside the orbit by claim 3, there are infinitely many such points. More precisely, I have the following two further claims. Claim 5 If $y$ is a point as described above, then $gy$ is another such point, for all $g\in G$. Proof If $U$ is a neighborhood of $gy$, then $g^{-1}U$ is a neighborhood of $y$. $y$ is as above, so $g^{-1}U$ contains a point of the orbit $\overline{g}x$. But then $g\overline{g}\in gg^{-1}U=U$, proving $U$ contains a point of the orbit. Thus, $gy$ is as above, just like $y$. $\hspace{8cm}\square$ Claim 6 If an action is properly discontinuous, then its orbits are in bijection with the group $G$. Proof Suppose it is not so. This means there exist $g_1,g_2\in G,x\in X$ such that $g_1x=g_2x$. But then we have $g_2^{-1}g_1x=x$. So without loss of generality, we can assume there exists $g\in G:gx=x$. But this cannot be, since there is a neighborhood of $x$ mapped by $g$ into a disjoint neighborhood of $gx$. $\hspace{8cm}\square$ That is all. I did not manage to show there cannot be a $y$ as above. I tried reaching a contradiction by supposing there was, but ended up with an orbit of such $y$s and an infinite number of subsets of $G\cdot x$ accumulating each around a different point of $G\cdot y$. I am tempted to say well, but then there are more points in $G\cdot x$ than in $G\cdot y$, but that cannot be since they are both in bijection with $G$. But then, $G$ is infinite, and this arguments works terribly with infinity. For example, a countable union of countable subsets would be more than countable with that argument, but in fact it is countable.

1211608,Analytic variety is a countable union of complex manifolds,"In an article on real analytic manifolds I came across the following remark: Let $W$ be a purely $k$-dimensional analytic subvariety of a domain in $\mathbb{C}^n$ and let $S$ be its singular locus. Let $V$ be an open relatively compact subset of $W$. Here is the remark: $\overline{V} \cap S$ is contained in the singular locus $S$ which, being an analytic variety of dimension $k-1$ , is ( by induction) a countable union of complex manifolds of dimensions $ \le k-1$. Could you tell me why is it so? Here is what I've found in Lojasiewicz's book ""Introduction to complex analytic geometry"" , page 217, thanks to Theo: $9.$ The decomposition of an analytic set $V \subset M$ into simple
  components  is the representation of $V$ as the union of a locally
  finite family of analytic  subsets $V_i$ of $M$ which are irreducible
  and such that $V_i \not\subset V_j$ for $i \neq j$. (Such  a family is always countable; see D. 1.) According to theorem
  $4$ below, such  a decomposition always exists and is unique. The sets
  $V_i$ are called simple  components of the set $V$. And here's the theorem: THEOREM 4 (On the decomposition into simple components). Every analytic set $V \subset M$ has a unique decomposition into
  simple components: $V =  \bigcup V_i$. Then
  $$V_i \setminus V^* = V_i^0 \setminus V^* =  V_i^0 \setminus \bigcup_{m \neq i}V_m $$ and all these sets are submanifolds, open and dense in $V_j^o $ (and
  hence also in $V_i$), and form the family of all connected components
  of the set $V^0$. Therefore  the simple components of the analytic set
  $V$ are precisely the closures of the connected components of the set
  $V^0$. We have the formulae : 
  $$ V^* = \bigcup V^*_i \cup \bigcup_{i,j} (V_i \cap V_j)$$ and 
  $$V^0 = \bigcup_i (V_i^0 \setminus \bigcup_{m \neq i} V_m)$$ I think this solves the problem. Am I right?","['complex-geometry', 'complex-analysis']"
1211612,Isomorphism of G with product group $H \times N$.,"This is a question I attempted from a text book. And I would like to know how far I am correct in my arguments and thought process. Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$, and let $\phi: G \to H $ be a homomorphism whose restriction to $H$ is the identity map:  $\phi(h) = h$ , if $h \in H$. Let $N = ker(\phi)$ (a) Prove that if $G$ is abelian then it is isomorphic to the product group $H \times N$.
(b) Find a bijective map $G\to H \times N$ without the assumption that $G$ is abelian, but show by an example that $G$ need not be isomorphic to the product group. My attempt: (a) Aim is show a bijection and homomorphism between $G$ and $H \times N$.
Denote the isomorphism as $\psi :  H \times N \to G$ First looking at the homomorhism $\phi$, I see that it's surgective homomorphism since each element in the codomain $H$ is mapped at least to $H$ subgroup in $G$. We have $\phi: G \to H $, i.e., the the whole group has $H$ as it's image which is also the image of  $H$ subgroup in $G$. $\phi(H)=H$  and $\phi^{-1}(\phi(H))=G=NH$(also $=HN$ since $N$ is a normal subgroup). Thus $G = HN$ which assures the surgectivity of $\psi$ Next observation is that $H \cap N$ is $\{1\}$ since $\phi(h) = h$ , if $h \in H$. Consider elements $(h_1,n_1), (h_2,n_2)$ in $H \times N$ which have same image $h_1n_1=h_2n_2$ in $HN$. i.e.,  $h_1h_2^{-1}=n_1^{-1}n_2$. So, $h_1h_2^{-1}=n_1^{-1}n_2 = 1$. Hence $h_1=h_2$ and $n_1=n_2$. Injectivy of $\psi$ is shown. Now consider the composition of two elements in $H \times  N$ $(h_1,n_1)$ and $(h_2,n_2)$, $(h_1h_2,n_1n_2)$. It's image in $G=HN$ would be $h_1h_2n_1n_2$ while the composition of individual products in $G$ would be $h_1n_1h_2n_2$. Since $G$ is abelian we say these are equal. Hence we have a homomorphism along with bijection making it isomorhism for $\psi: H \times N \to G$ . (b) If $G$ is not abelian, we don't have homomorphism, but we still have bijection $\psi: H \times N \to G$ defined by  $\psi(h,n)=hn$ Please let me know if there are any incorrect/loose arguments.

The question is: Let $\mathcal{T}_1$, $\mathcal{T}_2$ be two topologies on some set $X$, when is the identity map $id:X \to X$, $id(x) = x$ continuous? Here is my reasoning: If $\mathcal{T}_1 = \mathcal{T}_2$, then for any $S \in \mathcal{T}_2$, $id^{-1} (S) = S \in \mathcal{T}_1$ so then it's continuous. If $\mathcal{T}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_1$, then it's exactly like above, then it's also continouos. Now: If  $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$ then take some $x \in U \in \mathcal{T}_2 \setminus \mathcal{T}_1$, then $id^{-1}(U) \not\in \mathcal{T}_1$, so it's not continuous.

1211651,"Hoffman ""Linear Algebra"": why need such a long proof?","I'm reading ""Linear Algebra"" by Kenneth Hoffman and Ray Kunze. I don't quite understand why there's a long proof in $\S$6.4 Theorem 6. First the triangular matrix is defined: An $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is called triangular if $A_{ij}=0$ whenever $i>j$ or if $A_{ij}=0$ whenever $i<j$. Then defined triangulable: The linear operator $T$ is called triangulable if there is an ordered basis in which $T$ is represented by a triangular matrix. Then there's Theorem 5: Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over the field $F$ and
  let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$. Then $T$ is triangulable if and
  only if the minimal polynomial for $T$ is a product of linear
  polynomials over $F$. Now it comes Theorem 6: Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over the field $F$ and
  let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$. Then $T$ is diagonalizable if and
  only if the minimal polynomial for $T$ has the form $p = (x - c_1)
\dots (x - c_k)$ where $c_1, \dots , c_k$ are distinct elements of
  $F$. The proof is: (the (1)(2).. numbers are added by me) Proof (1) We have noted earlier that, if $T$ is diagonalizable, its minimal
  polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors (see the discussion
  prior to Example 4). (2)To prove the converse, let $W$ be the subspace spanned by all of
  the characteristic vectors of $T$, and suppose $W \ne V$.  .... What I don't understand is (2) -- why we need such a long proof (details are below) here? Since Theorem 5 already proved that ""minimal polynomial factors $p=(x-c_1)^{r_1}\dots(x-c_k)^{r_k}$, $c_i$ distinct $\Rightarrow$ $T$ is triangulable""; this part of Theorem 6 is ""minimal polynomial factors $p=(x-c_1) \dots(x-c_k)$, $c_i$ distinct $\Rightarrow$ $T$ is triangulable"", so we just need to let all the $r_i$ be $1$, isn't it? Proof details excerpted from Hoffman (1) We have noted earlier that, if $T$ is diagonalizable, its minimal
  polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors (see the discussion
  prior to Example 4). (2)To prove the converse, let $W$ be the
  subspace spanned by all of the characteristic vectors of $T$, and
  suppose $W \ne V$. (3)By the lemma used in the proof of Theorem 5,
  there is a vector $\alpha$ not in $W$ and a characteristic value $c_j$
  of $T$ such that the vector $\beta= (T - c_jI)\alpha$ lies in W. (4)Since $\beta$ is in $W$, $\beta = \beta_1+\dots\beta_k$ where
  $T\beta_i = c_i\beta_i$, $1\le i\le k$, and therefore the vector
  $h(T)\beta = h(c_1)\beta_1+\dots+h(c_k)\beta_k$ is in $W$, for every
  polynomial $h$. (5)Now $p = (x-c_j)q$, for some polynomial $q$. (6)Also $q- q(c_j) = (x - c_j)h$. (7)We have $q(T)\alpha - q(c_j)\alpha = h(T)(T - c_jI)\alpha = h(T)\beta$. (8)But $h(T)\beta$
  is in $W$ and, since $0 = p(T)\alpha = (T - c_jI)q(T)\alpha$, the
  vector $q(T)\alpha$ is in $W$. (9)Therefore, $q(c_j)\alpha$ is in
  $W$. (10)Since $\alpha$ is not in $W$, we have $q(c_j) = 0$. (11)That contradicts the fact that $p$ has distinct roots. QED.","['linear-algebra', 'minimal-polynomials', 'diagonalization', 'matrices']"

1211947,What is abstraction of direction in considering vectors such as used in Engineering & Physics?,"In the use of vectors of engineering and physics, we encounter objects that obey the axioms of a vector space but also have two new attributes of length (or, magnitude) and direction (e.g. direction in space). In the study of vector spaces, you do not encounter these notions of length and direction.  To obtain the idea of length, you need to consider a vector space with added structure to include the concept of normed vector elements as commonly displayed in Banach Space or Hilbert space (or others).  Indeed, other attributes such as a metric (e.g. Banach), and inner product can be included. But, where does the notion of direction come in?  The closest I get is the idea of using direction cosines derived from the inner product of an N-dimensional space of vectors.  But, is this the only abstraction of direction (which is not much of an abstraction to me).

1212012,Poincare-like inequality,"I would like to prove that there exists $C>0$ such that $$\| u \|^2_{L^2(B(0,1))} \leq C \left ( \| \nabla u \|^2_{L^2(B(0,1))} + \| u \|^2_{L^2(\partial B(0,1))} \right )$$ for every $u \in C^\infty(\overline{B(0,1)})$, where $B(0,1)$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^2$. To me this looks similar to a Poincare inequality except that it compensates for the fact that $u$ may not be zero on the boundary. With this in mind, I tried manipulating the version of the Poincare inequality where we subtract off the average so that it would look like this situation. With that I get a $C>0$ such that $$\| u \|^2_{L^2(B(0,1))} \leq C \left ( \overline{u}^2 + \| \nabla u \|^2_{L^2(B(0,1))} \right )$$ where $\overline{u}$ is the average of $u$ over $B(0,1)$. Now I get stuck trying to relate $\overline{u}$ to $u$ on the boundary. From here I would want to show that $\overline{u}^2 \leq C \| u \|^2_{L^2(\partial B(0,1))}$. But that can't work, because we could have a nonzero function which is zero on the boundary yet strictly positive on the interior. Of course, in this case the result follows from the Poincare inequality for $H^1_0$. So this result seems to be somewhat like an interpolation between the Poincare inequality for $H^1_0$ and the Poincare inequality for $H^1$ functions with mean zero.

Now if for a fixed positive integer $n$ , $3 * 2^n - 1$ and $3 * 2^n - 5$ are both prime then we have a Thâbit ibn Kurrah cousin prime.

Although its not reasonable to expect a proof for the conjecture since prime twins and cousin primes are not proven to be infinite sequences , it might be possible to disproof the conjecture. But I was not able to find a reason why the conjecture would fail. I know that there are only a finite amount of prime twins of type $2^n + 3$,$2^n + 5$ because from working with mod $24$ you can show that at least one of the two must be divisible by $3,5,7,11$ or $13$.

1212043,Prove $f$ is uniformly continuous,"I have a question about uniform continuity and want to verify what I did is correct. The question is Suppose that $f : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and all first partial derivatives exist and bounded. Prove $f$ is uniformly continuous or give counter example. I believe this is true statement. I tried this as follows. Proof.
Since the first partial derivatives of $f$ exist and bounded, then $\|\nabla f\| \leq M$ for some real number $M$. The Mean Value Theorem says that there exists $c \in \text{dom}(f)$ such that $f(x)-f(y) = \nabla f(c)(x-y)$. Caucy inequality shows that $\|f(x) - f(y)\| \leq \|\nabla f(c) \| \|x-y\| \leq M \|x-y\|$. Let $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{M} > 0$ and $\epsilon > 0$. Then, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $\forall x,y \in \text{dom}(f)$, $\|x-y\| < \delta$ implies $\|f(x)-f(y)\| \leq M \|x-y\| < M \delta = \epsilon$. Can anyone verify that this is correct?? It seems that it is not formally stated but I tried my best. Also one thing I am not sure about is that if I can use the mean value theorem for the function defined on $\mathbb{R}^2$. One variable mean value theorem can be applied to a function defined on a closed interval such as $[a,b]$. The textbook I am using defines the mean value theorem on a line segment with two end points $a,b$. So I was confused if I can use the mean value theorem to a function defined on $\mathbb{R}^2$.","['uniform-continuity', 'multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"

He derives the transformation law for the matrix $A$ as $A_{\alpha}=\varphi_{\beta\alpha}^{-1}d\varphi_{\beta\alpha}+\varphi_{\beta\alpha}^{-1}A_{\beta}\varphi_{\beta\alpha}$ Where $\varphi_{\beta\alpha}$ are the transition maps associated with the trivialisations of the vector bundle.

I want to get a better understanding of this statement. I understand how covariant and contravariant tensors transform under a change of coordinates.

I'm not sure if this is valid Attempt: Let $f\not\equiv\infty$ (otherwise there is nothing to be done). 
Suppose that there is an accumulation point $z$ of $A$ inside of $\Omega$.

Essentially, the left hand side of the identity can be interpreted as the number of ways to choose 2 $b$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$. What I am interested in is the derivation of the right hand side of the identity; I have read the proof in The American Math Monthly, and the author mentioned that the expression $\binom{n+b-j}{2b}$ refers to the selection of $2b$ objects from the original set $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$, augmented by the adjunction of $b-j$ ""jokers"", where $0\leq j\leq b-1$, to allow for the fact that the intersection of two distinct $b$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$ can have a minimum and a maximum cardinality of $0$ and $b-1$ respectively.
