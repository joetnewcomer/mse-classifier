624196,Calculating the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse,"I have a problem with a project requiring me to calculate the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse. I've also posted about this on StackOverflow, where you can see my progress. From what I understand from Planet Math you can simply compute the pseudoinverse only the first formula which I can understand, but it also says that this is for general cases , and you have to do SVD (singular value decomposition) and the formula becomes much complicated ( the second formula ) which I don't understand... I mean, What is V? What is S? I'm confused. How can I calculate SVD? Can you please help me building the code/algorithm, or just a simple advice? Why there are two pseudo inverse formulas? Left pseudo inverse formula
$$A_\text{left} = (A^TA)^{-1}A^T$$
Right pseudo inverse formula
$$A_\text{right}=A^T(AA^T)^{-1}$$ Thank you very much,

624213,Relation between $L^1(\partial\Omega)$ and the surface integral on $C^1$ domains,"Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a $C^{1}$ bounded domain. It is possible to define the space $L^1(\partial\Omega)$ as the set of functions $u\colon \partial\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ with the finite norm
$$\lVert u \rVert_{L^1(\partial\Omega)} := \sum_i\lVert {\phi_i(u\circ g_i)}\rVert_{L^1(B_i)}$$
where $\phi_i$ partition of unity, $g_i$ is a $C^1$ diffeomorphism and $B_i$ are subsets of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. There are lots of definitions like this (eg. see Renardy and Rogers, Krylov, James Robinson's Infinite Dimensional Dynamical System) or with small variations. There is also the surface integral of a function $v\colon \partial\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$:
$$|u| := \int_{\partial \Omega}fdS$$
where $dS$ is the surface density. To compute this quantity, we need to use a parametrisation. Now my question, is it always the case that
$$\lVert u \rVert_{L^1(\partial\Omega)} \qquad\text{and}\qquad |u|$$
are equivalent? Does this hold for all the little variations of the $L^1$ norm in the first equation?? Now when we have a Lipschitz surface, these norms are equivalent (see Necas). BUT their definition of the $L^1$ norm is different so let us not use that result here. Edit : hmm, it seems $C^1$ domains are not a subset of Lipschitz domains.","['differential-geometry', 'banach-spaces', 'sobolev-spaces', 'partial-differential-equations', 'functional-analysis']"

624226,Higher dimensional analogue of the correspondence between $2$d TQFTs and Frobenius algebras?,"It's well known that there is an equivalence between the category of $2$-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) over $\mathbb{C}$ and commutative Frobenius $\mathbb{C}$-algebras. This is fairly easy to prove by some standard diagram manipulation and a bit of topological intuition. Given that higher dimensional TQFTs are much more complicated than their $2$-dimensional cousins, I'm not expecting a full answer, but hopefully some partial results. Is there an algebraic category which is equivalent to the category of $n$-dimensional TQFTs over $\mathbb{C}$? It's possible that the 'algebraic category' part of the above question isn't well-formulated enough, but I hope that at least the spirit of my question is clear. Can we study the collection of $n$-dimensional TQFTs in an 'algebraic way'?","['quantum-field-theory', 'category-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

624234,Concrete Mathematics Reducing sums to closed form,"In reducing the sum $S_n = \sum_{1\leq j<k\leq n}(\frac{1}{k-j})$ to a closed form, the authors start by replacing $k$ with $k+j$, such that $S_n = \sum_{1\leq j<k+j\leq n}(\frac{1}{k})$. The next step then reduces $S_n$ to $\sum_{1\leq k\leq n}\sum_{1\leq j\leq n-k}(\frac{1}{k})$, and giving "" summing first on j "" as an explanation. I understand how $[1\leq j < k \leq n]=[1\leq k\leq n][1\leq j < k]=[1\leq j \leq k][j<k\leq n]$ (where $[P]$ denotes the Iverson bracket ), which is used in reducing many other sums in the book. But how do the authors use this identity to reduce  $\sum_{1\leq j<k+j\leq n}(\frac{1}{k})$ to $\sum_{1\leq k\leq n}\sum_{1\leq j\leq n-k}(\frac{1}{k})$? Is there any other identity used, or the previous one is somehow maniuplated?","['summation', 'discrete-mathematics']"
624239,Rational points and dimension of a variety,"Notice that $|GL_n(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ is a polynomial of degree $n^2$ in $p$, and that $GL_n(k)$ is a variety of dimension $n^2$.  Similarly, $|SL_n(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ is a polynomial of degree $n^2-1$ in $p$, and $SL_n(k)$ is a variety of dimension $n^2-1$. If $V\subset\mathbb{A}^2$ is the one-dimensional $k$-variety defined by the equation $xy-1=0$, then $\#V(\mathbb{F}_p)=p-1$.  As a final example, the $2$-dimensional variety defined by the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=0$ has $p^2$ $\mathbb{F}_p$-points. All of these examples cause me to ask a question that I doubt is true in general, but perhaps is true with some conditions. If $V$ is an $n$-dimensional variety defined over $\mathbb{Z}$, and $P$ is the set of primes, we can define a function $f:P\to\mathbb{N}$ by $f(p)=\#V_p(\mathbb{F}_p)$ where $V_p$ is the variety over $\mathbb{F}_p$ given by reducing mod $p$ the equations defining $V$.  Is $f$ a polynomial of degree $n$? I'm sure a counterexample exists, and I'd love to see one.  Also, if this is not true in general, what conditions can we add to $V$ that might make the claim true? Edit: PVAL's counterexample shows that $f$ might not be a strict polynomial, but that $f$ might be a ""piecewise"" polynomial, such that each piece has the appropriate degree: $$f=\begin{cases}2&p\equiv 1\;\mathrm{mod}\; 4\\0&p\equiv 3\;\mathrm{mod}\;4\\1&p=2\end{cases}$$ Notice that the dimension of $V(x^2+1)\subset\mathbb{A}^1$ is $0$.","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra']"

624246,Showing all p-local subgroups are char p given that all are contained in char p locals,"Question: How does one prove that if every $p$-subgroup $U$ is contained as a subnormal subgroup of a characteristic-$p$, radical, local subgroup containing the normalizer of $U$, then the normalizer of every $p$-subgroup $U$ has characteristic $p$? Here a group $X$ is said to have characteristic $p$ if $F^*(X) = O_p(X)$, that is, every minimal normal subgroup is a $p$-group and there are no subnormal subgroups $N$ with $N/Z(N)$ simple. In other words, suppose $G$ has the (weaker) property: If $U$ is a $p$-subgroup of $G$, then there is a $p$-subgroup $R \leq G$ such that $N_G(U) \leq N_G(R)$ and $U \leq R = O_p( N_G(R) ) = F^*( N_G(R) )$ where $F^*(X)$ is the generalized Fitting subgroup of $X$. I would like to conclude that $G$ has the (seemingly much stronger) property that if $U$ is a $p$-subgroup of $G$, then $O_p(N_G(U)) = F^*( N_G(U) )$. Motivation: I'm writing up an answer to this question and showed such groups have the weaker property. I'm reasonably confident this is a good direction, since page 94 of number 3 in GLS's CFSG claims that this follows from Thompson's A×B lemma on page 73 of number 2 in GLS's CFSG : Lemma: (Thompson's A×B Lemma) Assume $A\times B$ acts on $P$, where $A$ is a $p'$-group and $B$ and $P$ are $p$-groups. If $A$ does not centralize $P$, then $A$ does not centralize $C_P(B)$. More generally, suppose that $AB$ acts on $P$, where $B$ and $P$ are $p$-groups and
$[A,B] = 1$. If $A$ centralizes $C_P(B)$, then $O^p(A)$ centralizes $P$. Minimal Progress: Set $L=N_G(U)$ to be the local subgroup of $G$, and $K=O_p(L)$ to be its $p$-core. We need to show $F^*(L) = K$. By the property, we can find $R$ such that $K \leq R = O_p(N_G(R)) = F^*(N_G(R))$ and $N_G(K) \leq N_G(R)$. Indeed, one can check that $N_G(U) = L \leq N_G(K) \leq N_G(R)$. However, we need control on how $N_G(U)$ sits inside $N_G(R)$ to compare $F^*(N_G(U))/O_p(N_G(U))$ to $F^*(N_G(R))/O_p(N_G(R))$. I'm not sure how to use Thompson's A×B lemma. My best guess is the definition of the generalized Fitting as the intersection of the extended centralizers of the chief factors, but certainly not all of the chief factors are $p$-groups. Disturbing example: So a super-easy idea (that I wrote up to near completion before I realized it was flawed) was an induction. In the specific $G$, $N_G(R)/R$ is actually isomorphic to a direct product of smaller $G$ with the property, so if direct products and quotients by $p$-core work nicely, then everything is good. Unfortunately $(G=A_5,p=2)$ has the property (both weak and strong) while (somewhat obviously) $(G=A_5 \times A_5,p=2)$ does not (have either). If $G$ is $\operatorname{PSL}(4,4)$ then $N_G(R)/R$ can be $A_5 \times A_5$, hence the quotient induction cannot work.","['sylow-theory', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'linear-groups']"

624417,Are there an infinite number of binary operations for any set?,"I have just begun to take a look at A First Course in Abstract Algebra by Fraleigh. The following definition is provided (ed. 6, pp. 32). Definition: A binary operation, $*$ on a set $S$ is a function mapping $S \times S$ into $S$. For each $(a,b) \in S \times S$, we will denote the element $*((a,b))$ of $S$ by $a*b$. After experimenting with the definition, I began to wonder whether regardless of what $S$ is, will there always be a possible binary operation. I thought, yes. Conjecture: Let $S$ be a set. Regardless of what $S$ contains, there always exists at least one binary operation on $S$. Proof: Let $S = \emptyset $. Then the statement there exists a function mapping $S \times S$ into $S$ is vacuously true since there are no elements to map. Thus the proposition is true for the empty set case. Suppose $S$ is not empty. Let $a$ and $b$ be two arbitrary elements of $S$, and in the case where $S$ has just one element $a= b$. Definite $*$ to always return the first item in the ordered pair, such that $a*b=a$. This would map $S \times S$ into $S$ regardless of what the set $S$ may be. Therefore, every possible set has a possible binary operations. This seems to demonstrate there is always a binary operation for a set, but then it lead me to wonder whether there is also an infinite number of binary operations for any given set $S$. Conjecture: Let $S$ be a set. Regardless of what $S$ contains, there is an infinite number of possible binary operations on $S$. After thinking of possible binary relations, I think I have come up with a proof that shows the above statement is true. Proof: If $S$ is empty, then any declared binary operation would be vacuously true. If $S$ is not empty, and $S$ is an infinite set. Define a binary operation on $S$ as: let $a$ and $b$ be two arbitrary elements of $S$. Then $a *_n b$ always returns the $n^{th}$ element in the set $S$. Any infinite number of $n$ can be chosen, thus there are an infinite number of binary relations on $S$ when $S$ is infinite. If $S$ is not empty and finite, define a new set $S'$. $S'$ contains the same elements as $S$ in the same order, and where $S$ terminates, $S'$ continues with the last element of $S$ repeated over again. Thus defining the binary operation as in the infinite case, but on $S'$, we get the same result since every element in $S'$ is in $S$. Example: Let $S = \{ a , b , c \}$. Then $S' = \{ a , b , c , c , c , ... \}$ What I am wondering is: Are my proofs of my conjectures correct? Is there a more elegant way to address the question?","['binary-operations', 'abstract-algebra']"

624458,Let $f$ be an entire function which takes every value no more than three times. What can it be?,"Let $f$ be an entire function which takes every value no more than
  three times. What can it be? Consider the singularity at infinity. If it is removable then $f$ is constant. If it is a pole then $f$ is a polynomial, and it's clear that degree of $f$ is less than or equal to three. Suppose $f$ has an essential singularity at infinity. The Big Picard theorem says that it takes every value except for possibly one (call it $\omega$) in a neighborhood of $\infty$. Let $w\neq \omega$ and take some value $z_1$ where $f(z_1)=w$. Then there is a neighborhood of infinity which does not include $z_1$, and so there must exist another point $z_2$ where $|z_2|>|z_1|$ and $f(z_2)=2$. By induction there must exist a sequence $z_n$ of distinct points with strictly increasing moduli where $f(z_n)=w$, for all $w\neq \omega$. Edit: I suppose I should clarify why the degree of $f$ must be at most three. This should follow from the density of separable polynomials...suppose $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree greater than three. If $f(z)$ is separable, then $f$ takes the value zero at $>3$ distinct points. If $f$ is not separable, then I want to say that there is a constant $b$ such that $f+b$ is separable, and then $f$ takes the value $-b$ at $>3$ distinct points. But I should make this rigorous...after all, separable polys may be dense, but how do we know that a set of inseparable polynomials is not parallel to the subspace spanned by the constant polynomials (so $f+b$ is inseparable for all $b\in \mathbb{C}$)?

In 3d, I understand the curl as $d:\Omega^1(M^3)\to\Omega^2(M^3)$ and the divergence as $d:\Omega^2(M^3) \to \Omega^3(M^3)$. But what is the analog in 2d? It seems the curl is the operator $d:\Omega^1(M^2)\to \Omega^2(M^2)$, and then what could the divergence be? I recall using before the divergence theorem for two-dimensional vector fields...that $$\int_D\text{div}\,\sigma=\int_{\partial D}\sigma\cdot \nu, \tag{1}$$ where $\nu$ is the unit normal to the two dimensional region $D$. Where does this fit in with generalized Stokes' theorem, if $d:\Omega^1(M^2)\to \Omega^2(M^2)$ is the curl, not the divergence?

624701,find all subcartesian products of $S_4$ and $D_{12}$,"The following exercise is from [Cameron, Permutation Groups ]: Find all permutation groups of degree 10 which have orbits of length 4 and 6 and act on these orbits as the symmetric group $S_4$ and the dihedral group $D_{12}$ respectively, where $S_4$ acts in the natural way and $D_{12}$  acts as on the vertices of a regular hexagon. I think the problem is asking to find all the subcartesian products of the two groups $S_4$ and $D_{12}$.  Recall that given two groups $G_1 \le S^{\Omega_1}$ and $ G_2 \le S^{\Omega_2}$,  a subcartesian product of these two groups is any subgroup of the cartesian product $G_1 \times G_2$ whose restriction map on $\Omega_i$ is onto $G_i$ for each $i$. One way to obtain these subgroups is to work with generators of the two groups. We know that $x=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\alpha_4), y=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$ are two elements that generate $G_1=S^{\Omega_1}$ and $r=(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_6),s=(\beta_2,\beta_6)(\beta_3,\beta_5)$ generate $G_2=D_{12} \le S^{\Omega_2}$.  We are looking for all subgroups $H$ of $G_1 \times G_2 = \langle x,y,r,s \rangle$ that satisfy the property that $H^{\Omega_1} \cong S_4$ and $H^{\Omega_2} \cong D_{12}$. One such subgroup $H$ is of course all of $G_1 \times G_2$ itself, which has 288 elements. We could also consider different combinations of the two generating sets; for example, $H = \langle xr, ys \rangle$ is also a subcartesian product, but it needs to be shown it is a proper subgroup of $G_1 \times G_2$.  Surely any $H$ that answers our question would have at least 24 elements since $|G_1|=24$.  But it's not clear to me how all these subgroups $H$ can be obtained.","['permutations', 'discrete-mathematics', 'abstract-algebra']"
624703,Gross-Zagier formulae outside of number theory,"(Edit: I have asked this question on MO. ) The Gross-Zagier formula and various variations of it form the starting point in most of the existing results towards the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. It relates the value at $1$ of the derivative of the $L$-function of an elliptic curve $E$ to the canonical height of a very special rational point on $E$ called a Heegner point. Let me describe the Gross-Zagier formula in the simplest case. Setup . Let $E/\mathbf Q$ be an elliptic curve. According to the modularity theorem, there exists a finite $\mathbf Q$-morphism $p :X_0(N) \to E$ mapping the cusp $\infty$ to the origin of $E$, where $N$ is the conductor of $E$. Let $K\subseteq \mathbf C$ be an imaginary quadratic field, other than $\mathbf Q[i]$ or $\mathbf Q[\sqrt{-3}]$, in which the prime factors of $N$ split. Then we can choose an ideal $\mathcal J$ in $\mathcal O_K$, such that $\mathcal O_K/J \simeq \mathbf Z/N\mathbf Z$. Viewing $\mathcal J$ as a lattice in $\mathbf C$, we can form the elliptic curves $C_\mathcal J = \mathbf C/\mathcal J$ and $C_K = \mathbf C/\mathcal O_K$. While they are a priori elliptic curves over $\mathbf C$, we know from the theory of complex multiplication that they are actually defined over the Hilbert class field $H$ of $K$. Anyways, the inclusion $\mathcal J \subseteq \mathcal O_K$ induces by passage to the quotient an isogeny $C_\mathcal J \to C_K$ of degree $N$, which is precisely the kind of gadget that $X_0(N)$ parametrizes as a moduli space. Thus we get a point in $X_0(N)(H)$. We can take the image of this point via the modular parametrization $p$ to get a point $y_J \in E(H)$. Taking the sum of its Galois conjugates down to $K$ we get a point $y_K \in E(K)$, which, it turns out, doesn't depend on the choice of $\mathcal J$, up to sign and up to torsion. This means that its Néron-Tate height $\hat{h}(y_K)$ is a well-defined non-negative real number, which, by the non-degeneracy of the height pairing, is zero if and only if $y_K$ is a torsion point on $E$. With this setup, Gross and Zagier proved: Theorem : $$L'(E/K, 1) = \hat{h}(y_K) \frac{\iint_{E(\mathbf C)} \omega \wedge i\omega}{\sqrt D},$$ where $\omega$ is the invariant differential on $E$ (suitably normalized), and $D$ is the discriminant of $K$. Since the factor $\frac{\iint_{E(\mathbf C)} \omega \wedge i\omega}{\sqrt D}$ is never zero, we have: Corollary : Suppose that $L(E/K, s)$ has a simple zero at $s=1$. Then $y_K$ is a point of infinite order in $E(K)$, and in particular, $\text{Rank}_\mathbf{Z}E(K)>0$. Thus, we have an example of a situation where the vanishing of $L(E/K, s)$ at $s=1$ implies the existence of an (explicit!) point of infinite order in $E(K)$ -- a behavior which is, of course, predicted by the BSD conjecture (minus the ""explicit"" part, which comes as a surprise). If we believe BSD, it is natural to make the following: Conjecture (Gross-Zagier): Suppose that $L'(E/K, 1)$ is nonzero, or equivalently, that $\hat{h}(y_K)$ is nonzero, or still equivalently, that $y_K$ is non-torsion. Then $E(K)$ has rank exactly one, and $\left<y_K\right>$ has finite index in it. This conjecture was proven by Kolyvagin. In any case, since $\hat{h}(y_K) = \left<y_K, y_K\right>$ where $\left<,\right>$ is the Néron-Tate height pairing on $E$, we can rewrite the Gross-Zagier formula as $$L'(E/K, 1) = \left<y_K, y_K\right> \times C$$
where $C$ is the nonzero constant of the formula. Let me now tell you about something completely different, namely the Minakshisundaram-Pleijel zeta function. (I don't know enough about this, so please forgive any inaccuracies.) Given a compact Riemannian manifold $M$, one has the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ on $M$ which generalizes the familiar Laplacian on $\mathbf R^n$. The spectrum of this operator is an important invariant of $M$, and it is encoded in the M-P zeta function
$$\zeta(\Delta, s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \lambda_n^{-s}.$$
It admits a meromorphic continuation to the whole plane, and is holomorphic at $s=0$. Its Taylor coefficients at $0$ around contain geometric data about $M$. Let us specialize to the case where $M$ is a surface; then
$$\zeta'(\Delta, 0) = \frac{1}{12}\int_M K dA$$
where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature. According to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, this is essentially the Euler characteristic, so:
$$\zeta'(\Delta, 0) = \chi(M) \times C.$$
But there is a more suggestive way of writing the Euler characteristic. The diagonal $D \subseteq M \times M$ determines a cohomology class (its Poincaré dual) on $M \times M$; moreover it lies in the piece of the cohomology of $M\times M$ which is self-dual with respect to Poincaré duality, so the expression $\left<D, D\right>$ makes sense (it is the ""self-intersection"" number of the diagonal). In fact, as is well-known, $\left<D, D\right>$ is precisely the Euler characteristic of $M$. So, we can write 
$$\zeta'(\Delta , 0) = \left<D, D\right> \times C.$$ Corollary: If $\zeta'(\Delta, 0) \neq 0$, then $D$ is a nontrivial cohomology class on $M\times M$. Thus, we have a (completely different!) example of a situation where the non-vanishing of the derivative of a zeta function implies the existence of a non-trivial cohomology class which ""accounts"" the non-vanishing (viewing a rational point on $E(K)$ as a degree $0$ Galois cohomology class). Questions : Is the similarity between the two formulas, and between their Corollaries, coincidental? (This question probably doesn't have a precise answer, but I feel that it's worth asking.) And, assuming that the answer to this question is not completely disappointing... Have things like this been pointed out before?  Are there more examples of formulas outside of number theory which bear resemblance to the Gross-Zagier formula?","['zeta-functions', 'number-theory', 'homology-cohomology', 'riemannian-geometry', 'elliptic-curves']"

Then there is some $x\in D_0$ and $x\in D_1$, i.e., $x\in B\backslash A$ and $x\in f[\,B \backslash A \,]$, so we have $x= f(y)$ for $y\in B\backslash A \subseteq C$. But then $f(y)\in A$ by definition of $f$, which contradicts that $x = f(y)\in B\backslash A$. Now suppose we have already proven the assertion for $n\ge 0$ and we may assume that $D_{n+1} \cap D_{n+2} \not= \varnothing$. Let $x \in D_{n+1} \cap D_{n+2}$. So $x = f(y)$ for $y\in D_{n}$ and $x=f^2(z)$ for $z\in D_n$. Since $f$ is 1:1, we have $y= f(z)$. Then $y=f(z)\in D_{n} \cap D_{n+1}$. But, by inductive hypothesis $D_{n} \cap D_{n+1} = \varnothing$, a contradiction. (2) Now we have to show $D_n \cap D_{n+1+\ell}=\varnothing$ for all $\ell \in \mathbb{N}$. The base case follows from (1). We may assume that the claim is true for $\ell \ge 0$ and we will show that also hold for $\ell+1$. By contradiction suppose that $D_n\cap D_{n+1+\ell+1} \not= \varnothing$. Let $x\in D_n\cap D_{n+1+\ell+1}$. So, $x= f^2(z)$ where $z\in D_{n+\ell}$, if we set $y = f(z)$, so $\,y \in D_{n+1+\ell}$. And there is where I'm stuck. Some hint? I've not try yet the last part of the exercise. Thanks in advance. Note: I'm not sure if the title is  really appropriate. If someone think that is better idea to change it, for me is ok.","['proof-verification', 'self-learning', 'elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"

Also, they may have an inverse which is not necessarily in $\mathbb{Z}^{n\times n}$. I made some approachs (I don't know how to spoil, so if you want to think it yourself stop reading): As my intuition says to me that there will always be solutions for $n>1$, then, it suffices to show there will be solutions for $n=2$ and $n=3$ (because then you can form a matrix composed by matrices $2\times 2$ and $3\times 3$ in its diagonal).

ANSWERED ($a_2$) Let $C(\mathbb{R})$ be as before and let $I$ be denote the subring of functions which are eventually zero. Clearly $I$ is an ideal of $C(\mathbb{R})$. (We can think of the coset $f + I$ as the set of all functions that eventually coincide with $f$ and then by multiplying $(f+I)(g+I)= fg + I$ we get functions which eventually coincide with $fg$.) ($a_2?$) Is $I$ maximal in this case? What is a natural way of thinking about the quotient $C(\mathbb{R})/I$? ANSWERED [$b$] Let $C(\mathbb{R})_B$ denote the ring of real valued bounded functions defined on $\mathbb{R}$. That is for every $f(x) \in C(\mathbb{R})_B$ there exists $M>0$ such that $|f(x)| \leq M$ for all $x$. $C(\mathbb{R})_B$ is a ring under pointwise addition and multiplication of functions. Let $I \subset C(\mathbb{R})_B$ denote the the subset of all functions $f(x)$ with $\lim_{x \to \pm \infty} f(x)=0$. $I$ is an ideal (any bounded function times a function that vanishes at infinity vanishes too). [$b?$] Is $I$ maximal in this case? How should i think about the quotient ring $C(\mathbb{R})_B/I$? My thought is that if $C(\mathbb{R})_B$ contained only function with well defined limits at $\pm \infty$ then $C(\mathbb{R})_B/I$ was isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$ yet this is not the case so I'm not sure at all what to make of this. I have some more examples which i would like to verify but it's getting to be a long question so I'll end it here.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Here we have zero in the region, so the squaring map is not conformal there. Any ideas? Update: There is a nearly identical problem in Ahlfors, exercise 3.4.2 #8, as @bryanj points out.

625491,radius of convergence of half iterate of sinh(z)?,"The half iterate of sinh(z) has a formal power series, centered around z=0.

If it converges, what is the radius of convergence?  Are there any other singularities in the complex plane for the half iterate of the sinh(z)?  The sinh(z) is an entire function, with exponential growth at the real axis, for both positive and negative z.  It has a fixed point of zero, with a fixed point multiplier of 1.
$$\sinh(x)=\frac{\exp(x)-\exp(-x)}{2} = x + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^5}{120}+ \frac{x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^9}{9!} ....$$ One can generate a formal half iterate of the function, such that half(half(x))=sinh(x). $$\text{half}(x) = x + \frac{x^3}{12} + \frac{-x^5}{160}+ \frac{53x^7}{40320} + \frac{-23x^9}{71680} + \frac{92713x^{11}}{1277337600} + ....$$ Such a half iterate would have ""half-exponential"" growth as abs(real(z)) gets bigger, which is why I was curious if it was entire, since I don't know of any entire ""half exponential"" functions.  The coefficients of the half iterate of asinh(z) appear to be mostly decreasing, with the 41st coefficient $\approx  0.0000000047072111$.  Does such a half iterate function converge at the fixed point at the origin, or is the convergence only illusory, with the series actually asymptotic, rather than converging?

This gives us a total of 24 perfect squares so far. Now we create a set $  A$ of 24 unique elements, where each element represents one of the 24 unique perfect squares. (Note that we have not counted $ 1^2$ as a perfect square that divides the product yet; we'll do this later). $ S=\{p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,...,p_{24}\} $ Since we have that the product of any number of perfect squares is also a perfect square, then we have count to the number of ways we can choose $1,2,3,4,...,23,24$ elements from the set since the product of $n$ elements, where $ 1 \le n \le 24$, is also a perfect square. Hence we evaluate: $ \displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{24} {24 \choose n}=2^{24}-1 $ Since we still have to count $ 1^2$, we add that in hence the number of perfect squares that divide $ \displaystyle \prod_{n=1}^9n!$ is $ 2^{24}-1+1=\boxed{2^{24}} $.

All i can do is  : If Sylow $3$ subgroup, Sylow $5$ subgroup, Sylow $7$ subgroup is normal then $G$ is abelian. Notation : $P_3$ for Sylow $3$ subgroup ; $P_5$ for Sylow $5$ subgroup; $P_7$ for Sylow $7$ subgroup We know that  : For $H\leq G$ the quotient group $N_G(H)/C_G(H)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\text{Aut(H)}$ . As $P_3\unlhd G$ we have $N_G(P_3)=G$ As $P_5\unlhd G$ we have $N_G(P_5)=G$ As $P_7\unlhd G$ we have $N_G(P_7)=G$ Thus, we will have The quotient group $G/C_G(P_i)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\text{Aut($P_i$)}$ for $i=3,5,7$ . In case of $P_3$ we have $G/C_G(P_3)\cong M \leq \text{Aut($P_3$)}$ Now, $|P_3|=3^2$ so, $|\text{Aut($P_3$)}|=3(3-1)=6$ As $C_G(P_3)\leq G$ we see that $|C_G(P_3)|$ divides $|G|$ with the condition $|G/C_G(P_3)|$ divides $6$ . As $P_3$ is abelian we have $H\leq C_G(P_3)$ so, $G/C_G(P_3) \leq G/P_3$ i.e., $G/C_G(P_3)\leq G/P_3$ i.e., $|G/C_G(P_3)|$ divides $|G/P_3|=5^2\cdot7$ we already have a condition that $|G/C_G(P_3)|$ divides $6$ . But, $6$ and $5^2.7$ do not have a common factor other than $1$ so, $|G/C_G(P_3)|=1$ i.e., $C_G(P_3)=G$ i.e., $P_3\leq Z(G)$ . In case of $P_5$ we have $G/C_G(P_5)\cong M \leq \text{Aut($P_5$)}$ Now, $|P_5|=5^2$ so, $|\text{Aut($P_5$)}|=5(5-1)=20$ As $C_G(P_5)\leq G$ we see that $|C_G(P_5)|$ divides $|G|$ with the condition $|G/C_G(P_5)|$ divides $20$ . As $P_5$ is abelian we have $H\leq C_G(P_5)$ so, $G/C_G(P_5) \leq G/P_5$ i.e., $G/C_G(P_5)\leq G/H$ i.e., $|G/C_G(P_5)|$ divides $|G/P_5|=3^2\cdot7$ we already have a condition that $|G/C_G(P_5)|$ divides $20$ . But, $20$ and $3^2.7$ do not have a common factor other than $1$ so, $|G/C_G(P_5)|=1$ i.e., $C_G(P_5)=G$ i.e., $P_5\leq Z(G)$ .

As $P_7$ is abelian we have $H\leq C_G(P_7)$ so, $G/C_G(P_7) \leq G/P_7$ i.e., $G/C_G(P_7)\leq G/P_7$ i.e., $|G/C_G(P_7)|$ divides $|G/P_7|=3^2\cdot7$ we already have a condition that $|G/C_G(P_7)|$ divides $6$ . Now there is a hitch.... I can not use same arguments as i have used for $P_3$ and $P_5$ as $3$ does divide $6$ and $3^2.7$ . So, I can not immediately conclude $|G/C_G(P_7)|=1$ i.e., $G=C_G(P_7)$ i.e., $P_7\leq Z(G)$ . Assuming I have Proved $P_i\leq Z(G)$ for $i=3,5,7$ It would not take much time to conclude $G=Z(G)$ As $P_i\cap P_j =\{e\}$ for $i\neq j$ and $i,j\in \{3,5,7\}$ we see that $G=\langle P_3,P_5,P_7\rangle$ But then $P_i\leq Z(G)$ for $i=3,5,7$ i.e., $G =\langle P_3,P_5,P_7\rangle \leq Z(G)$ i.e., $G=Z(G)$ which means $G$ is abelian. So, I am done on more than $40$ percent of the problem leaving possibility of $|G/C_G(P_7)|=3$ and I do not really understand how to make use of $P_3$ being Normal to conclude $P_5$ and $P_7$ are Normal. I am not sure of the procedure but I have something to say  on $P_5$ being normal : As $P_3$ is normal I can consider $G/P_3$ with $|G/P_3|=5^2.7$ So, If i see this group as something named $M$ This subgroup have a Sylow $5$ subgroup and a Sylow $7$ subgroup. But the condition $n_5=1+5k$ dividing $7$ gives only possibility that $n_5=1$ Which means that Sylow $5$ subgroup of $M$ (I wish i could make this as $P_5$ ) is normal. With similar reason $n_7=1+7k$ dividing $5^2$ gives only possibility that $n_7=1$ Which means that Sylow $7$ subgroup of $M$ (I wish I could make this as $P_7$ ) is normal. So I guess I am done up to $60$ percent. I am not so sure how to make use of (believing that I can make use of) Sylow $5$ subgroup, Sylow $7$ subgroup of $M$ being normal to conclude $P_5$ and $P_7$ are normal. I would be thankful if some one can help me to clear two gaps in this : How to get rid of $|G/C_G(P_7)|=3$ .
