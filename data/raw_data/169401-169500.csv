2979398,What is the valid range for elements of a Quaternion vector to be used for rotation?,"I have seen different people saying different things about this so I'm confused. Assuming that each element of the Quaternion vector represents a rotation along some axis, it does not make sense to be able to rotate something more than $\pm360^\circ$ . Based on this intuition, we can normalize all elements of this 4-D vector to get values in the range $[-1, 1]$ . Although I might be wrong in my intuition/interpretation, some other people say that the $L_2$ Norm of the 4-D Quaternion vector must not exceed more than $1$ . However, if all values of the Quaternion vector are $\pm1$ the $L_2$ Norm would be $2$ . So I am confused on what is the range of valid values for the elements of a Quaternion vector. More specifically, what would be the valid range of values for the elements of the Quaternion vector if I want to limit the rotation in a 3D (XYZ) space to, say, $\pm30^\circ$ or $\pm45^\circ$ along each axis? I would appreciate if someone can clarify on this. The reason that I need to know the valid ranges for the Quaternion vector elements is that I want to avoid using Euler angles to rotate 3D shapes. Instead, I want to be able to randomly sample valid Quaternion vectors. So I need to know what to set the maximum and minimum value of each of the elements so that I get a valid Quaternion rotation. Also, I need to set these bounds in an optimization algorithm.","['coordinate-systems', 'geometry', 'complex-analysis', 'quaternions', 'rotations']"

2979595,Picking the correct Ansatz for valid solutions in Asymptotic Methods,"I am trying to find the solution to the following equation, $\epsilon x^3 -x^2 +x-\epsilon^{\frac{1}{2}}=0$ , for the first two non-zero solutions as $\epsilon \to 0^+$ . I have used the principal of dominant balance (by a Kruskal Newton Graph) to find that my ansatz should be of the form $x(\epsilon)=\dfrac{z(\epsilon)}{\epsilon^\alpha}$ where $\alpha=0,\dfrac{1}{2},1$ . Now if we substitute these into our equation we get, for each $\alpha$ : $\alpha=0 : \ \epsilon x^3 -x^2 +x-\epsilon^{\frac{1}{2}}=0 $ - noting $x=z$ ; $\alpha=\dfrac{1}{2}: z\epsilon^{\frac{1}{2}}-z^2+z\epsilon^\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon^\frac{3}{2}$ ; $\alpha=1: \ z^3-z^2+z\epsilon-\epsilon^\frac{1}{2}$ . Now it is clear that if we perturb our equations in the form $z(\epsilon)=z_0+\epsilon z_1 +...$ then we have, for $\alpha=0 \ \& \ 1$ , an $\epsilon^\frac{1}{2}$ term which can only be equated to zero. Does this mean that we do not have a valid solution for these choices of $\alpha$ ? Whereas, if we consider $\alpha=\dfrac{1}{2}$ then we have an equation of the form: $(z_0+\epsilon z_1)^3\epsilon^\frac{1}{2} -(z_0+\epsilon z_1)^2 +(z_0+\epsilon z_1)\epsilon^\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon^\frac{3}{2}=0$ whose coefficients can all be equated, thus valid solutions.

Let the point $P = (-6, 3, 3)$ and the line $L=(-2t,-6t,t)$ . I am trying to find the shortest distance between the point and the line. From my observation, I believe the line passes through the origin because it can be written as $$L=\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} +t \begin{bmatrix}-2 \\ -6 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$ . Let $Q$ denoted $(a, b, c)$ be a point on $L$ such that $\vec{QP}$ is the shortest distance between $L$ and $P$ . Note that $\vec{QP}$ is normal to $L$ . Therefore, I need to find $\vec{QP}$ which is $\vec{P}-\vec{Q}$ . $\vec{QP} = (-6 - a, 3 - b, 3 -c)$ We know that $\vec{QP}$ and $L$ are perpendicular so the dot product is 0. $$-2(-6 - a) - 6(3 - b) + (3 - c) = 0$$ Simplifying gives us $$2a + 6b - c -3 = 0$$ let $a=0$ , $b=1$ , then by solving we know that $c=3$ . From my understanding, we should have found $Q$ which intersects $L$ and $\vec{QP}$ . Unfortunately, it seems $||\vec{QP}||$ is not the correct answer.

2979945,A continuous Function from $R$ to a Banach Space is Borel-Measurable,"I think the notation of my book is a bit odd, so I'm having trouble finding any other sources to help me with this proof. The thing I'm trying to prove is that a continuous function, $f$ , from $R$ to a Banach Space, $B$ , is Borel-Measurable. The definition that my book uses is that a function, $f$ is Borel-Measurable if there exists a sequence of functions that converges pointwise to $f$ , s.t every entry of the sequence is the finite sum of scaled indicator sets of the $\sigma$ -ring formed by the Borel subsets of $R$ . My thoughts so far are that any point, $b \in B$ is closed, and so the pre-image of $b$ under $f$ should also be a closed set, and thus $f^{-1}[b]$ is in my $\sigma$ -field. As such, I could use the indicator function for this set and express $f$ as $f = \sum_{b \in B}b\dot E_{f^{-1}[b]}$ where $E_{f^{-1}[b]}$ is the indicator function for the set $f^{-1}[b]$ . However, this sum may not be finite. My next thought was to instead of summing over $b \in B$ , sum over balls of radius $\frac{1}{n}$ and then this would converge to my function in the pointwise limit. However, this would assume that my Banach Space is totally bounded. It seems no matter what I think of I'm missing something. Can anyone offer any advice or suggestions?

2980015,Showing that all elements of a Field Extension are transcendental,"My question is whether my strategy for this proof is correct. I'll put the fact to be proven, my strategy, and why I am hesitant about my strategy. Thing to be proven: I want to show that if $E$ is an extension field of $F$ , and $\alpha \in E$ is transcendental over $F$ then every element of $F(\alpha)$ (field of quotients of $F[\alpha]$ ) is also transcendental over $F$ . My Proof Strategy: Assume $\beta \in F(\alpha)$ and $\beta$ is algebraic. Then $\exists p(x) \in F[x]$ such that $p(\beta) = 0$ . But since $\beta$ is a polynomial in $\alpha$ , that means that some polynomial in $\alpha$ with coefficients in $F$ is equal to $0$ so $\exists q(x) \in F[x]$ such that $q(\alpha) = 0$ . My Concerns: $\beta$ is in a field of quotients of $F[\alpha]$ , but this can be circumvented because in order for that to be $0$ we just need the ""numerator"" which is in $F[\alpha]$ to have a root. Showing rigorously that $p(\beta)$ is a polynomial in $\alpha$ seems like a pain. It makes sense, but doing a general solution seems hard. This makes me think that an easier solution might be to somehow employ theorems about the fact that $\langle p(x)\rangle$ must be a maximal ideal. So my question is, which route would yield an easier and more elegant solution?","['field-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'extension-field']"

And that's when I had a thought. Using the double angle formula for tangents, we have: $$\arctan x=2 \arctan \frac{\sqrt{1+x^2}-1}{x}$$ This seems to work for any values of $x$ , but what' especially important, we have: $$\left|\frac{\sqrt{1+x^2}-1}{x} \right| \leq 1, \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}$$ Which means, we can use the usual arctangent addition formula for this: $$\arctan x+\arctan y=2 \arctan \frac{f(x)+f(y)}{1-f(x)f(y)} \\ f(x)=\frac{\sqrt{1+x^2}-1}{x}=\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}+1}$$ If we divide by $2$ , this could be called the ""arithmetic mean of arctangents"".. My questions are: is this formula valid for any $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ ? is there a simpler formula for the whole domain, which doesn't require us to add some multiple of $\pi$ to the result, depending on the signs and the values of $x,y$ ?

Prove that every set of five points such that no three are collinear and no four are concyclic has exactly four separators. (IMO Shortlist 1999 G2) This problem can be solved by means of inversion or Möbius transformations. But I was stuck making elementary solution which does not makes use of those tools. I reached at the point that the following may be useful For each three distinct points $P$ , $Q$ , $R$ , let $\Gamma(P,Q,R)$ be the outer circle of $PQR$ . Let $A_1A_2A_3 \cdots A_n$ be a convex polygon where no three of the consecutive vertices are colinear and $n \ge 3$ .

But after trying some quick treat, I realized that this is essentially the problem of curvature.(Anyway, I cannot prove this either) So my question is the following Let $\gamma$ be a smooth closed simple curve whose curvature never vanishes. Prove that the osculating circle at the point where the curvature is minimum encloses the curve. I know that the question is so elementary that it is almost surely duplicate.

J. P. Ballantine [1] shows that you can formally divide by $d$ and get the correct integral. For example, he arrives at $$\int x^2 \sin x\,dx=(2-x^2)\cos x + 2x\sin x + C$$ using long division! [1] J. P. Ballantine. Integration by Long Division. The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 58, No. 2 (Feb., 1951), pp. 104-105 Surely the claim that this is rigorous is questionable. However, it would be fascinating to understand how to follow this method and maybe even understand why it works; the example has no explanation, and I can’t put the steps together via reverse engineering. Could someone shed some light on this technique? addendum: An additional example would really complete the perfect response $\ddot\smile$","['integration', 'indefinite-integrals']"

The video is 800 pixles tall, so the Y-values range from about 200 to 600. This is a graph of ( the data ): Using this Python/OpenCV script , was able to manually fit a sine wave to the data. The thick blue line is the source data. The thick green line is the manually fitted sine wave, which is composed of the two thinnest sine curves: From manually fitting the sine wave, I know that this function is the sum of two sine waves. The period of the longer wave is 2x the period of the shorter wave. A FFT seems to confirm this: In conclusion, I can describe this data by manually (visually) fitting a sine curve.

After the test is completed, the grader tells you how many you got correct but not which ones. What's the best way to maximize the expected value of the fourth attempt? My thoughts: So, to clarify the question, one way to make the expected value equal to $9.5$ is as follows: Attempt 1: Answer question $1$ and leave the rest blank. If the grader tells you that you got $1$ right, you know the answer to question $1$ with certainty. If the grader tells you that you got $0$ correct, then you still know the question to $1$ with certainty (if you put true, then it will be false). Attempt 2: Repeat with question 2. Attempt 3: Repeat with question 3. So, we're guaranteed three questions right, and the expected value for attempt four is $3 + \sum_{i=1}^{13}1 \cdot 1/2 = 3 + 6.5 = 9.5$ . So we're expected to get $9.5$ right. Another thing that someone could do is answer ""TRUE"" for every question on attempt $1$ . That'll tell you how many true/false questions there are in total. Then, on the second attempt, leave the second half of the test blank, and answer TRUE for everything in the first half. This is sort of like a binary search. It tells you how many are true in the first half, and in the first quarter, etc. I didn't get anywhere with this. Is my solution of an expected value of $9.5$ the most optimal solution?

2981713,Are inner product-preserving maps always linear?,"Let $E,F$ be Pre-Hilbert spaces and $T: E \rightarrow F$ be a map that preserves the inner product, that is $\langle Tu , Tv \rangle = \langle u , v \rangle$ for all $u,v \in E$ . Must it be true that $T$ is linear? If $T$ is surjective one has $$\langle T(\lambda u+v), Tw\rangle = \langle \lambda u + v, w \rangle = \lambda \langle u, w \rangle + \langle v, w \rangle = \langle \lambda Tu, Tw \rangle + \langle Tv, Tw \rangle  \iff \langle T(\lambda u + v) - \lambda T u - Tv, Tw\rangle = 0$$ Now since $T$ is surjective one can choose $Tw$ to be $ T(\lambda u + v) - \lambda T u + Tv$ , and by positive definiteness the linearity follows. Can this somehow be extended if $T$ isn't surjective?","['isometry', 'linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis', 'linear-transformations']"

x_n = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)^2} - \sqrt n
$$ Show that $\{x_n\}$ is a bounded sequence. This sequence appears a bit tricky because it involves harmonic series. Below are steps I take. Lower bound: $$
\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)^2} \ge \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k}{k}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n1}=\sqrt{n}\implies\\
\implies x_n \ge \sqrt n - \sqrt n \ge 0
$$ Lower bound is simple. Upper bound: To get rid of radical lets use Cauchy-Schwarz (note the below is incorrect as shown in Zvi's answer): $$
\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)^2} \le \sqrt{\left(\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)\right)^2} =\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right) = n+\sum_{k=1}^n{1\over k} = n + H_n
$$ So this doesn't show $x_n$ is bounded above. I've tried another approach: $$
\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)^2} - \sqrt n = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)^2 - n}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)^2} + \sqrt n}
$$ Consider nominator: $$
\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)^2 - n=n+\sum_{k=1}^n{2\over k}+\sum_{k=1}^n{1\over k^2}-n = \sum_{k=1}^n{1\over k^2} + \sum_{k=1}^n{2\over k}
$$ For denominator: $$
\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\frac{k+1}{k}\right)^2} + \sqrt n = \sqrt{n + \sum_{k=1}^n{1\over k^2}+\sum_{k=1}^n{2\over k}} + \sqrt n
$$ So $x_n$ is: $$
x_n = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^n{1\over k^2} + \sum_{k=1}^n{2\over k}}{ \sqrt{n + \sum_{k=1}^n{1\over k^2}+\sum_{k=1}^n{2\over k}} + \sqrt n }
$$ But i don't see how to proceed from this point. What else could i try? How to show $x_n$ is bounded above? Please note the precalculus tag.","['algebra-precalculus', 'upper-lower-bounds', 'sequences-and-series']"

(\bar z_1, \bar z_2, ...) \cdot (z_1,z_2, ...) \equiv (z_1,z_2, ...)^\dagger\cdot (z_1,z_2, ...)=1,
$$ It looks that we have a unitary group $$u \in U(n+1)$$ with $$u^\dagger \cdot u =1$$ symmetry group, so $$
z_i \to u z_i

(u(z_1,z_2, ...))^\dagger\cdot (u(z_1,z_2, ...))=(\bar z_1, \bar z_2, ...)u^\dagger \cdot u (z_1,z_2, ...)=1,

The same can be done with the other two sides, obtaining other $2$ couples of circles and other $4$ points $F,G,H,I$ . My conjecture is that The sum of the areas of the triangles $\triangle IDG$ and $\triangle FHE$ is equal to the area of the triangle $\triangle ABC$ . (Notice that $I,D,G$ and $F,H,E$ are the intersection points of three distinct couples of circles, underlined by the different colors. I suspect that similar conjectures can be formulated starting from different choice of these points. E.g., if we consider the triangles $\triangle EHG$ and $\triangle FID$ , the sum of the area of the first one and the area of the original triangle $\triangle ABC$ seems to give the area of the second one, as illustrated below). This is probably a very obvious result, and I apologize in this case. However, I would need some hint to provide a compact proof of such conjecture.
