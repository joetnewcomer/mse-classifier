77824,Limit proof of a sqrt-heavy expression with binomial formula / sandwich-rule,"Let be
$$b_n := \sqrt{n+\sqrt{2n}}-\sqrt{n-\sqrt{2n}}, n\in\mathbb{N}$$
a sequence. I am to determine $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}b_n$ which is obviously $\sqrt{2}$. My first step was to transform the sequence to $-\sqrt{(-\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{n})\sqrt{n}}+\sqrt{(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{n})\sqrt{n}}$ however this didn't helped me out. Some fellow students used some funky binomial formula to bound the limit to a specific range via the ""sandwich rule"" (I didn't found a suitable translation from german to english) which is defined by: Definition. Let $a_n\leq a_n'\leq a_n''$ for nearly all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Then one has
$$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}a_n = \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}a_n''=a\Rightarrow\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}a_n'=a.$$ I do understand the basic idea to find an expression similiar to $\sqrt{n\pm\sqrt{2n}}$ to be able to bound the limit to a range however it doesn't seem obvious to me what I can do here. My second idea was to show that $b_n$ is bounded by $[0;2)$ and then to conclude, that $\sqrt{2}$ is the proper limit. Is anyone able to explain the idea with the binomial formula and the sandwich-rule? EDIT My fellow students tried to prove $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\sqrt{n\pm\sqrt{2}}=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\sqrt{n\pm\sqrt{2}+0.5}=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\sqrt{(n\pm\sqrt{2}/2)^2}$ however I do not understand how to develop this idea. Their next step was to show $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}b_n=\sqrt{2}$ via $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left(\sqrt{n\pm\sqrt{2}}-(n\pm\sqrt{2}/2)\right)=0$. Can anyone tell me whether this is correct and explain what is the clue behind this?","['arithmetic', 'convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"
77837,Showing that one axiom of the concept group action implies another (similar to group homomorphisms),"[Beware that my question is at the bottom of all this text.] We defined in a group theory course a group action to be a mapping $$\nu:G\times X \rightarrow X,$$ $(G,\cdot)$ group and $X$ some set, such that the axioms $$ \textrm{(GA1)} \ \ \  \nu(1,x)=x$$ and $$ \textrm{(GA2)} \ \ \ \nu(g,\nu(h,x))=\nu(g h, x)$$
hold for every $g,h\in G$ and $x\in X$. We defined a group homomorphism to be a map $$f:G\rightarrow H,$$ such that the axioms $$\textrm{(HOM1)} \ \ \  f(1_G)=1_H $$  and $$\textrm{(HOM2)} \ \ \ f(gh)=f(g)f(h)$$ hold for all $g,h \in G$. Now, obviously, these axioms for the homomorphism aren't minimal, meaning (HOM2) $\Rightarrow$ (HOM1). So, naturally, I asked myself, if the same doesn't happen with the group action axioms, meaning (GA2) $\Rightarrow$ (GA1). Now the thing is, I can show that this is the case by showing that a mapping $\nu$  satisfies (GA2) iff the mapping $$\tau: G\rightarrow X_{\leftrightarrow} ,$$ where $X_{\leftrightarrow}$ is the group  of all bijections on $X$ together with the composition, defined by $$\tau(g)(x)=\nu(g,x),$$ is a homomorphism: $(\tau(g)\circ \tau(h))(x)=\tau(g)(\nu(h,x))=\nu(g,\nu(h,x)),$ which by (GA2) equals $\nu(gh,x)=\tau(gh)(x)$, and $\nu(g,\nu(h,x))=\tau(g)(\tau(h)(x))$ which by (HOM2) equals $\tau(gh)(x)=\nu(gh,x)$ for all $g,h\in G$ and $x\in X$. From that I can now show (GA1) by the following implications:
$$ \textrm{(GA2)} \Leftrightarrow \textrm{(HOM2)} \Rightarrow \textrm{(HOM1)}  \Rightarrow \textrm{(GA1)}. $$ Now (finally) my question: Can't I show that (GA1) follows from (GA2) directly ? I tried doing that, but couldn't succeed, because unlike showing  $ \textrm{(HOM2)} \Rightarrow \textrm{(HOM1)}  $ I don't have an thing like an ""inverse to $\nu(1,x)$"" that I can apply upon $\nu(1,\nu(1,x))=\nu(1,x)$ to get $\nu(,x)=1$.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

77886,Bounded spherical derivative implies finite order,"Let $f$ be an entire function. The Spherical Derivative $\rho(f)$ is defined by
$$\rho(f)(z):= \frac{|f'(z)|}{1+|f(z)|^2}.$$ A result from Clunie and Hayman states that if $\rho(f)$ is bounded, then $f$ is of exponential type. The proof uses the machinery of Nevanlinna's theory of value distribution. My question is the following : Is there an ""elementary"" proof that if $\rho(f)$ is bounded, then $f$ is of finite order ? (Note that this is a weaker result, since I'm only asking for finite order here).
Finite order means that there exists constants $K$ and $\alpha$ such that
$$|f(z)| \leq Ke^{|z|^\alpha}$$
for all $z$. Motivation : Motivation : I'm interested in this because it would lead to a quick proof of Picard's little theorem. Indeed, if there exists a non-constant entire function which omits $0$ and $1$, then it is possible to obtain (using normal families techniques) a non-constant entire function $f$ which omits $0$ and $1$ and that has bounded spherical derivative. Write $f=e^g$ for some entire function $g$. Since $f$ is of finite order, $g$ is a polynomial. But f does not take the value $1$, so g must be constant, a contradiction. Any reference is welcome,

77896,Does this contradict the Closed Graph Theorem?,"Question: Let $C^{'}[0,1]$ and $C[0,1]$ be endowed with sup norm. Define $T:C^{'}[0,1]\to C[0,1]$ by $$Tf=f^{'}\text{ for each }f\in C^{'}[0,1]$$
Where, $'$, indicates differentiation. Prove that $T$ is a linear map with closed graph but it is not bounded. $Proof:$ For linearity: Let $f_{1}$, $f_{2}\in C^{'}[0,1]$ $\alpha,\beta$ scalars, then $$T(\alpha f_{1}+\beta f_{2})=(\alpha f_{1}+\beta f_{2})^{'}=\alpha f_{1}^{'}+\beta f_{2}^{'}=\alpha Tf_{1}+\beta Tf_{2}.$$ For the closer of $T$, Let ${f_{n}}$ be a sequence in $C^{'}[0,1]$ such that $f_{n}\to f$ and $Tf_{n}=f_{n}^{'}\to y$. Then $\|Tf_{n}-y\|=\sup_{t\in [0,1]}|T(f_{n})(t)-y(t)|=\sup_{t\in [0,1]}|T(f_{n}^{'})(t)-y(t)|\to 0$ as $n\to \infty$ Thus, the convergence is uniform and $y(t)=\lim_{n\to \infty}f_{n}^{'}(t)$. Since the convergence is uniform $f^{'}(t)=y(t)$ for all $t\in [0,1]$. Thus, $f\in C^{'}[0,1]$ and $Tf=y$ so $T$ is closed. To show $T$ is not bounded, take $f_{n}(t)=t^{n}$, then $\|f_{n}\|=\sup_{t\in [0,1]}|t^{n}|=1$ and $f^{'}_{n}(t)=nt^{n-1}$ so that $\|Tf_{n}\|=\sup_{t\in [0,1]}|nt^{n-1}|=n$. Thus, $T$ is not bounded. This implies $T$ is not continuous. My question here is, does this example contradict the Closed Graph theorem? Which says: If you have two Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$ and $T$ a linear map from $X$ to $Y$ such that the graph of $T$ is closed. Then $T$ is continuous.",['functional-analysis']
77898,Subgroups as isotropy subgroups and regular orbits on tuples,"Is there some natural or character-theoretic description of the minimum value of d such that G has a regular orbit on Ω d , where G is a finite group acting faithfully on a set Ω ? Motivation :
In some cases, there are so many kinds of orbits of G on Ω that every subgroup of G appears as a point-stabilizer.  However, these actions are quite rare, even in the case of a point group of a group of Euclidean isometries. (The only such actions in 2D are C 1 , D 1 , and C p for primes p .  This follows because rotation subgroups only stabilize the origin.) (example for D4 by Bill Cook) . If we allow the group to act on subsets too, then we may have better luck.  See for instance, the lovely example of dihedral groups and cyclic groups acting naturally on the Euclidean plane as Rosette groups.  Here one can take various natural subsets of the polygon to get all subgroups. In general a finite point group of a group of Euclidean isometries has a regular orbit, and the blocks of that orbit suffice to specify all subgroups (there is a 1-1 correspondence between subgroups containing a point stabilizer and blocks of the orbit given, and this correspondence is given by the set-wise stabilizer).  This is true more generally for small groups acting on large vector spaces (if V is n -dimensional over K and | G |−1 < 1+| K |+…+| K | n −1 , then G has a regular orbit on V in any faithful, linear action of G on V ; in particular finite groups acting on infinite vector spaces are fine). However, determining which medium-ish linear groups over medium-ish vector spaces have regular orbits is really hard, as far as I know.  I wondered if it was much easier if we allowed one to replace V by V ⊕ V .  Certainly we can replace V by V V (taking d =| V |), but that is a bit extreme. Is there some reasonable value of d that can be read from the permutation character of G on Ω , from the (Brauer) character of G on V , or some other natural invariant of the action of G on Ω ? An expression for the minimum would be nice, but even some decent bound on d in terms of invariants would be fine. To identify Galois groups, one also looks for certain invariants for polynomials, and I believe what I am asking is relevant to how complicated such invariants need to be.  GAP for instance takes d ≤ 5, I think (and used to take d ≤ 3, I think), but it has lots of ""backup"" routines to identify various other subgroups, possibly for efficiency, but possibly because one cannot choose d that small in general.","['finite-groups', 'representation-theory', 'group-theory', 'characters']"

What about $\Omega$ a set with cardinality greater than that of the natural numbers? That is, is the cardinality of $S_{\Omega}$ equal to, or greater than, that of $\Omega$ ?

Let $x$ be a curve,  $s(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t} \left \| \frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t} \right \| d\tau$ is an arc length parameter. We have the unit-speed reparametrization $y(s) = x(t(s))$, in fact $$1=\left \| \dot{y}(s) \right \| = \left \| \frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t} \right \| \, \frac{\mathrm{d} t}{\mathrm{d} s}.$$ Suppose that u is a parameter that makes $y(u) = x(t(u))$ a unit-speed parametrization. Then $$1=\left \| \dot{y}(u) \right \| = \left \| \frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t} \right \| \, \frac{\mathrm{d} t}{\mathrm{d} u}$$

78065,Find conjugation invariant functions without using eigenvalues?,"Let $M_n(\mathbb C)$ be the algebra of $n\times n$ complex matrices.  The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial $\det(\lambda I-A)=\sum f_i(A)\lambda^i$ are polynomials in the entries of $A\in M_n(\mathbb C)$, and are conjugation invariant.  Moreover, every conjugation invariant polynomial function $F:M_n(\mathbb C)\to \mathbb C$ is of the form $P(f_0,f_1,\ldots, f_{n-1})$ for $P\in \mathbb C[x_0,\ldots,x_{n-1}]$. Here is a proof (hover mouse over to view): Given a group action on a space, any continuous invariant function must be constant on the closure of each orbit.  Because the closure of every conjugacy class contains a diagonal matrix, the entries of which are the eigenvalues of the matrices in the conjugacy class, invariant functions must be polynomials in the eigenvalues.  Given any permutation $\sigma\in S_n$, we have that $\operatorname{diag}(a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ is conjugate to $\operatorname{diag}(a_{\sigma(1)},\ldots, a_{\sigma(n)})$, and hence an invariant function must be a symmetric function in the eigenvalues.  The coefficient $f_i(A)$ is up to a sign the $(n-i)$th elementary symmetric function in the eigenvalues of $A$, and since the elementary symmetric functions generate the ring of all symmetric functions, the result follows. Is there a proof that doesn't require reducing the problem to eigenvalues and symmetric functions?

It didn't quite work out... $2^nabc$ is always even. So if $a^2+b^2+c^2 = 2^nabc$, then  $a^2+b^2+c^2$ must be even. That means there is $a_1$, $b_1$, $c_1$ so that 
$a = 2a_1$, $b = 2b_1$, and $c = 2c_1$ So 
$(2a_1)^2+(2b_1)^2+(2c_1)^2 = 2^nabc \rightarrow 2(2a_1^2+2b_1^2+2c_1^2)= 2^nabc$ and we get $2a_1^2+2b_1^2+2c_1^2= 2^{n-1}abc$ We can continue to do this procedure with $a_2$, $b_2$, $c_2$ then $a_3$, $b_3$, $c_3$ then ... $a_n$, $b_n$, $c_n$. With $a_n$, $b_n$, $c_n$ we'd get $2^na_n^2+2^nb_n^2+2^nc_n^2= 2^{n-n}abc=abc$ Since $a_n=2a_{n-1}$ and $a_0=a$, $a_n = \frac{a}{2^n}$ and we get $2^n(\frac{a}{2^n})^2+2^n(\frac{b}{2^n})^2+2^n(\frac{c}{2^n})^2=abc$ This just becomes the original equation.

Locally, the gradient descent path is described by the gradient of $F_{A}$ $$ \nabla_{M} F_{A} = 2 (M A - I ) A^{T}  $$ or in component notation (trying very hard to not use Einstein summation notation), looks like: $$ \frac{\partial F_{A}^{(ij)} }{ \partial M_{xy}} = 2 \sum_{k} ( \sum_{p} (M_{ip} A_{pk}) - \delta_{ik} ) A_{jk}   $$ now, it is pretty clear from the above expression that its third derivative is zero.

78264,Close zeros of analytic functions,"If an analytic function $f(z)$ has two zeros which are close together, there is a zero of $f^\prime(z)$ which is nearby.  This is clear if $f(z)$ is a quadratic polynomial, and intuitive in general from the Hadamard product: $f(z)$ is a quadratic polynomial times a function which is nearly constant in the neighborhood of the zeros. How rigorous can we make this statement? Without loss of generality, we can translate so the origin is the midpoint of the two zeros, rotate so they are both real, and dilate so the zeros are $\pm1$, so $f(z)=(1-z^2)g(z)$, with (suppose) $g(z)\ne0$ on $|z|<1$.  Thus $\log(g(z))$ is well defined on the disk, and we can write $g(z)=\exp(h(z))$ with analytic $h(z)$. Thus we seek $z$ (hopefully in $|z|<1$) satisfying $-2z+(1-z^2)h^\prime(z)=0$. Edit :  Based on robjohn's comment, we need to quantify the heuristic above that the 'remainder' of the Hadamard product is roughly constant near the zeros.

It may be useful to know that the polynomials are dense in $L^2(\mu)$. Edit : Here is a proof for $n=1$. It is sufficient to show that any $f \in C^\infty_c(\mathbb{R})$ can be approximated by polynomials.

Then $$ Pr(X=k) \approx \binom{n}{k}\left(\frac{1}{e}\right)^{k}\left(1-\frac{1}{e}\right)^{n-k} $$ where $1/e$ is an approximation for $(1-1/n)^{n-1}$. This approximation works great when $n$ is big and poorly when $n$ is small (like $n<5$). Anyway, I'm looking for an exact expression.  Anyone have an idea?

78445,Does law of large numbers converge in $L^1$?,"I've seen the law of large numbers stated mainly in two (or three) forms: $S_n/n$ converges in probability (weak law) and converges almost surely (strong law).  Also, there is convergence in the $L^2$ -norm for uncorrelated random variables ( $L^2$ weak law). However there is a backwards martingale proof of the strong law of large numbers (any graduate level probability theory book, for example Durrett, should have it).  The important thing is that $M_{-n}:=S_n/n$ is a backward martingale, and backward martingales converge both a.e. and in the $L^1$ -norm.  Then, in particular, $S_n/n$ converges in the $L^1$ -norm.

It would be nice if “ordinary” ones (e.g. rotations about one face-centered axis) had smaller numbers. It would be nice if the digits of the numbering had significance in base 2 (an example would be if $i \bmod 2$ indicated whether transformation $i$ was a reflection), or otherwise gave meaning to arithmetic operations on them. In the relevant coordinate system, the cube is axis-aligned and has opposite corners $(0,0,0)$ and $(d,d,d)$. This is going to be implemented in a computer program, and the symmetries are eventually going to be used in the form of a precomputed table of points and basis vectors, so the best form would be a function of the symmetry number, a point to transform, and $d$. (In case it's interesting: I'm working with axis-aligned voxels, i.e. $\mathbb{Z}^3$ rather than $\mathbb{R}^3$. Non-right angles are therefore completely irrelevant to this part of my work.)

The question is: The limit superior of a numerical sequence $\{x_{k}\}$ (presumably this means the sequence is real valued) can be defined as the supremum of the set of limit points of the sequence. Show that this is the same thing as defining $$ \limsup _{n \to \infty} ~ x_n = \bigwedge_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigvee_{k=n}^{\infty} x_k .$$ This question comes from Chapter 4 of ""Probability and Measure"" by Patrick Billingsley. The problem is that Billingsley assumes the reader knows what the symbols $\bigwedge$ and $\bigvee$ are - but I do not! The best I have come up with is that they are the ""meet"" and the ""join"" symbols used in a lattice? Could anybody shed some light on how this problem might be attacked? Billingsley does give some hints to the problem. He says that the following are all equivalent: $x<x_k$ i.o. OR $x<x_k$ for some $k\geq n$, for all $n\geq 1$ OR $x<\bigvee_{k=n}^{\infty} x_k$ for all $n\geq 1$. Using this kind of logic he shows that $$\bigwedge_{n=1}^{\infty}\bigvee_{k=n}^{\infty}x_{k} = \sup\{ x: x<x_n \text{ i.o.}\} .$$ Apparently the supremum of the set above can be seen to be the supremum of the limit points of the sequence - this would prove the result. I think I follow this derivation but I was taking the $\bigvee$ and $\bigwedge$ symbols to simply mean $\bigcup$ and $\bigcap$ for singleton sets $\{x_{k}\}$. I think this is the wrong assumption. I also cannot see the last assertion about the limit points of the sequence. Any help would be much appreciated.","['limsup-and-liminf', 'lattice-orders', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"

One of the provided series should converge, and the other should diverge. A divergent series was easy to find: $\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n-1} \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)$.  I'm having a much harder time coming up with a convergent series, though.  In fact, I suspect there isn't one. Informally (since it's been many years since I myself studied this topic): Since $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n \neq 0$, then it either diverges or converges to some other number.  Since the series is positive and monotone nonincreasing, it cannot diverge.  Let $L$ be the positive number to which it converges.  Then the odd terms of the alternating series converge to $L$ from above, and the even terms converge to $-L$ from below.
