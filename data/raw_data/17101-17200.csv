140271,How does Combination formula relates in getting the coefficients of a Binomial Expansion?,"Sorry for the very basic question. I'm a programmer, not a mathematician. The title says it all but I'll just include a little background on why I asked the (stupid?) question. I'd just finished solving Problem 15 from Project Euler . I used brute force (soooo slow) and I was curious if there's a faster way to do solve the problem. Most people from the Project Euler forum said that the problem could be solved using Combination or Pascal's Triangle. I googled those terms and found these interesting posts: Pascal's Triangle and Binomial Expansions Binomial Expansions The Binomial Theorem and Pascal’s Triangle I understood the facinating relationship between Binomial Expansions and Pascal's Triangle, but I don't quite get the ""Combination formula"" as the shortcut/formula in getting the Binomial Coefficients. Request: Since I'm not a math gal, please refrain from posting very ""deep""/complicated formulas. Just imagine you're trying to teach Binomial Expansions to a 9th grade student. ;) If this is a duplicate post, I'm sorry, I don't know what math terms to search for. If I used the wrong terminologies, I'm sorry. Feel free to edit them. Thanks in advance. :) Related but hard to grok (for me) post: question about binomial expansion's coefficients","['binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"
140291,Diagonal in projective space,"This is exercise $2.15$ from Harris book ""Algebraic Geometry: A First Course"". Show that the image of the diagonal in $\mathbb{P}^{n} \times \mathbb{P}^{n}$ under the Segre map is isomorphic to the Veronese variety $v_{2}(\mathbb{P}^{n})$. Would the idea is just map everything to itself and ignore the repeated monomials of degree $2$ for example if $n=1$ we get that the diagonal under the Segre mapping sends a point $([a : b],[a:b]) \mapsto [a^{2} : ab : ab : b^{2}]$. Now this almost looks like the $2$-Veronese map $\mathbb{P}^{1} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{2}$ given by $[s : t] \mapsto [s^{2} : st : t^{2}]$. So what I  mean is simply ignore the repeated monomial $ab$ and map $[a^{2} : ab: ab : b^{2}]$ to $[a^{2} : ab : b^{2}]$. Would this work?",['algebraic-geometry']
140292,Convex hull of balls,"The convex hull is defined as the smallest convex set containing a set of points. Now we want to generalize it to a set of balls. If these balls have the same radius, then it can be shown that a ball lies on the boundary of the convex hull of balls if and only if its center lies on the boundary of the convex hull of center. My question is: what about the case when the balls have different radii? Can we solve it in $O(n\log n)$ time, when there are $n$ balls? The correspondence between the convex hull of centers and the convex hull of balls seem to disappear, thus giving me the difficulty.

140302,A problem about the twisted cubic,"I have some difficulty  with the following problem: Let $f : k → k^3$ be the map which associates $(t, t^2, t^3)$ to $t$ and let $C$ be the image of $f$ (the twisted cubic). Show that $C$ is an affine algebraic set and calculate $I(C)$ . Show that the affine algebra $Γ(C)=k[X,Y,Z]/I(C)$ is isomorphic to the ring of polynomials $k[T]$ . I found a solution in the case when $k$ is an infinite field: Clearly $C$ is the affine algebraic set $C=\big<X^3-Z,\;X^2-Y\big>$ and moreover $\big<X^3-Z,\;X^2-Y\big>\subseteq I(C) $ . To prove the inclusion "" $\supseteq$ "", let $F$ be a polynomial with $F\in I(C)$ . Then we can write (thanks to successive divisions): $$F(X,Y,Z)=(X^3-Z)\cdot Q(X,Y,Z)+(X^2-Y)\cdot P(X,Y)+R(X).$$ For all $t\in k$ we have $$0=F(t,t^2,t^3)=R(t)$$ and since $k$ is infinite then $R$ is the zero polynomial and $I(C)=\big<X^3-Z,\;X^2-Y\big>$ . Now since the function $f$ is an isomorfism between $C$ and $k$ follows that $\Gamma(C)\cong \Gamma(k)=k[T]$ . I can not find the ideal $I(C)$ if the field $k$ is finite.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

140311,Number of permutations for a cycle-type,"In the proof that the alternating group $A_5$ is a simple group, we first write cycle-types of the conjugacy classes of $S_5$ which correspond to cycle-types $$1, 2^1, 2^2, 3^1, 2^13^1, 4^1, 5^1$$ and clearly the permutations of cycle-types $1, 2^2, 3^1, 5^1$ are even. But then my lecture notes state that there is $1$ permutation of cycle type $1$, $15$ of type $2^2$, $20$ of type $3^1$ and $24$ of type $5^1$ making $60$ in total. My question is how did they find the number of permutations for each cycle-type? A follow up question is that my lecture notes then state that: 'The problem is that these classes are in $S_n$, and two permutations could conceivably be conjugate in $S_n$ but not in $A_n$.' Is this because it could be possible that the element $f \in G$ which 'links' two elements in the same conjugacy classes could be in $S_n$ but not in $A_n$?

140381,Prove that every finite p-group is nilpotent.,"Let $G$ be a p-group $|G| = p^n$ . Then $G$ is nilpotent in the following sense: Let $C^1(G) = [G,G] = G'$ And $C^n(G) = [G,C^{n-1}]$ . $G$ is nilpotent iff there is a $n_0$ such that $C^n = \{e\}$ . What I proved in previous exercises is: If $H$ is a proper subgroup of a nilpotent group then $H$ is a normal proper subgroup of its normalizer. i.e.
if $H \lneq G$ then $H \lneq N_G(H)$ . I use induction: If $|G| = p$ , then $G$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ which is cyclic. therefore $C^1(G) = G' = \{e\}$ .
Suppose that the following assertion is true: if $|L| = p^i$ , for $i \lt n$ then $L$ is nilpotent. Let $G$ be a group of order $p^n$ . If I can just prove $G' \neq G$ , then we'd have $|G'| = p^i, i \lt n$ and in such a case $G'$ would be nilpotent. So that $G$ would be nilpotent. Is it?

140423,"Maximize the integral of $f$, knowing the integral of $\frac{1}{f}$, for a Lipschitz function $f$","This question is related to this recent other question , where two intervals $[a,b] $ and $[c,d]$ were considered. Here I ask about a simpler version with just
one interval $[a,b]$. Consider the following optimization problem : $f$ is a positive continuous function $[a,b] \to ]0,+\infty[$, satisfying the Lipschitz condition $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq L|x-y|$ for any $x,y \in [a,b]$. Given the constraint $\int_{a}^{b}\frac{dt}{f(t)}=\alpha$ (where $\alpha$ is a positive constant), the problem is then to find the maximum (or supremum) value $M$ of $\int_{a}^{b}f(t)dt$ under this constraint, and find the functions for which this maximum is attained, if any. Although my evidence for this is still incomplete, I believe the maximum is attained when $f$ is a decreasing affine function with coefficient $-L$. In this case, $$
f(t)=L\bigg(b-t+\frac{b-a}{e^{L\alpha}-1}\bigg), \
\int_a^{b} f(t)dt= L(b-a)^2\bigg(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{e^{L\alpha}-1}\bigg)
$$ By the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, when looking for the maximum we may assume that $f$ is differentiable (we may even assume that $f$ is a polynomial). In this case, one may apply the methods explained in the abovementioned post : $|f'| \leq L$, so $|(f^2)'| =|2ff'| \leq 2L|f|$ and hence $f^2(x) \leq f^2(a)+2LF(x)$, where we put $F(x)=\int_a^x f(t)dt$. So $f(x)=\frac{f^2(x)}{f(x)} \leq \frac{ f^2(a)+2LF(x)}{f(x)}$. Putting $G(x)=f^2(a)+2LF(x)$, we deduce $\frac{G'(x)}{G(x)} \leq \frac{2L}{f(x)}$. integrating between $a$ and $b$, we obtain
${\sf ln}\big(\frac{G(b)}{G(a)}\big) \leq 2L\alpha$. Now $G(a)=f^2(a)$ and
$G(b)=f^2(a)+2L\int_a^b f(t)dt$, so that one finally obtains $$
\int_a^b f(t)dt \leq \frac{e^{2L\alpha}-1}{2L}f^2(a)
$$ Any feedback appreciated on the following questions : what is the maximum/supremum, which functions attain equality.","['optimization', 'lipschitz-functions', 'calculus', 'integration', 'functional-analysis']"
140428,Continuous versus differentiable,"A function is ""differentiable"" if it has a derivative. A function is ""continuous"" if it has no sudden jumps in it. Until today, I thought these were merely two equivalent definitions of the same concept. But I've read some stuff today which seems to be claiming that this is not the case. The obvious next question is ""why?"" Apparently somebody has already asked: Are Continuous Functions Always Differentiable? Several answers were given, but I don't understand any of them. In particular, Wikipedia and one of the replies above both claim that $|x|$ has no derivative. Can anyone explain this extremely unexpected result? Edit: Apparently some people dislike the fact that this is non-obvious to me. To be clear: I am not saying that the result is untrue . (I'm sure many great mathematicians have analysed the question very carefuly and are quite sure of the answer.) I am saying that it is extremely perplexing . (As a general rule, mathematics has a habit of doing that. Which is one of the reasons why we demand proof of everything.) In particular, can anyone explain precisely why the derivative of $|x|$ at zero is not simply zero? After all, the function is neither increasing nor decreasing, which ought to mean the derivative is zero. Alternatively, the expression $$\frac{|x + a| - |x - a|}{a}$$ becomes closer and closer to zero as $a$ becomes closer to zero when $x=0$. (In fact, it is exactly zero for all $a$! ) Is that not how derivatives work? Several answers have suggested that the derivative is not defined here ""because there would be a jump in the derivative at that point"". This seems to assert that a continuous function must never have a discontinuous derivative; I'm not convinced that this is the case. Can anyone confirm or refuse this argument?","['continuity', 'intuition', 'derivatives', 'analysis']"

Suppose $W : \Bbb{R}^n \to \Bbb{R}_+$ is a continuous, positive function, with exactly $n$ zeros $\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n$ . Define the following 'distance': $$ d(\xi_i,\xi_j)=\inf\left\{\int_0^1 \sqrt{W(\gamma(t))}| \gamma'(t)|dt : \gamma \in C^1([0,1];\Bbb{R}^n), \gamma(0)=\xi_i,\ \gamma(1)=\xi_j\right\}$$ Suppose I have a set of real, positive numbers $\sigma_{ij}>0,\ i \neq j$ with the property that $\sigma_{ij}=\sigma_{ji}$ and $\sigma_{ij} \leq \sigma_{ik}+\sigma_{kj},i,j,k=1,...,n$ . My question is: Can we find $\alpha_i, i=1..n$ and $W$ with the desired properties, such that $d(\alpha_i,\alpha_j)=\sigma_{ij}$ ? I have asked the question on MathOverflow also, and got an answer which is not complete and I couldn't finish it myself. It is possible to prove the existence of such a function if there is a finite metric space with distances $\sigma_{ij}$ that can be embedded in $\Bbb{R}^n$ , but I would like to prove the general case also. I think I might have proved a weaker form, that there exists a sequence of continuous functions $W_n$ such that the corresponding distances $d^n(\alpha_i,\alpha_j)$ converge to $\sigma_{ij}$ . I did this by embedding in $\Bbb{R}^n$ a set of $n$ points with pairwise distance $1$ . Then define a function $f$ on the union $K$ of segments with these endpoints such that the path-integral on each segment $[\alpha_i,\alpha_j]$ is $\sigma_{ij}$ . Then extend $f$ to the whole $\Bbb{R}^N$ continuously and positively and consider $\sqrt{W_\varepsilon(x)}=f(x)+\frac{1}{\varepsilon}d(x,K)$ . Then I used a $\Gamma$ -convergence trick to obtain that the limits of minimizers $d^\varepsilon(\alpha_i,\alpha_j)$ for $W_\varepsilon$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$ are in fact $\sigma_{ij}$ . I have a few questions: It seems that I've used the existence of geodesics, i.e. distance minimizing paths between $\alpha_i,\alpha_j$ . I have heard of Hopf-Rinow theorem , but I've never used this theorem. Is it applicable here? Does the existence of the sequence of functions $W_\varepsilon$ such that the respective geodesics with lengths $d^\varepsilon(\alpha_i,\alpha_j) \to \sigma_{ij}$ implies somehow the existence of my desired function? Is there another way to approach the problem? I tried to consider functions of the form $$ W(x)=\prod_{i=1}^n |x-\alpha_i|^2 \cdot \sum_{1\leq i<j \leq n} a_{ij}x_i^2x_i^2 $$ so that the function has as many parameters as the desired distances $\sigma_{ij}$ . The problem is that when $a_{ij}$ change, the minimizing path, if exists also change, and this is not a linear problem.

In such a space, an object which travels out to the left hand side of the cube instantly reappears at the right hand side (and similarly for the top-bottom and the front-back).  Therefore, standing inside the center of a 3-torus, we could look to the right (or left) and see the back of our own head.  We could also look straight up (or down), or straight out the front (or back) of the cube and see ourselves. Is the conceptualization of a 3-torus described above considered to be topologically equivalent to an actual 3-torus that is obtained by embedding the cube in 3-dimensional space or higher, and physically gluing the three pairs of opposite faces of the cube? Now, you construct a string-like path in three dimensions made up of three double-vortex figures which start at the center of a cube (with its opposite sides conceptually joined together), spiral out to cover two faces of the cube (the top and left rear, the right front and right rear, and the left front and bottom), and come back to the center.  The purpose of constructing this particular path is to geometrically model a type of flower called a calla lily. This path has a 1.5 turn spiral vortex directly above the top face of the cube that is exactly the mirror image of a 1.5 turn spiral vortex directly below the bottom face.  The two vortices are conceptually joined together.  Similarly, the 1.5 turn vortices from the left rear and right front are conceptually joined together, and the vortices from the right rear and left front are also conceptually joined together.  If this string-like path is arrayed around a cube conceptualized as a 3-torus, and the vortices projected out from the cube are conceptually joined together in similar fashion as the top-bottom, right-left, and front-back face pairs, would such a path be considered as topologically equivalent to an actual 3-torus as described above?",['general-topology']

Or should it just be $P(\{3\}) = \frac{1}{6}\times\frac{4}{6}$ since the dice are similar and there is no mention that the two dice are unique (e.g. different in colour, size etc.).

In this situation, my understanding is : since $\Vert\varphi_n-u\Vert_p\to 0$ and $\Vert\varphi_n-v\Vert_{p^*}\to 0$ there is a subsequence $\{\varphi_{n_{k_i}}\}$ converges almost everywhere to both $u$ and $v$, then $u=v$ a.e. But in the $D_0^1(\Omega;a)$ case, does there also a subsequence converges to $\varphi$ a.e.? Or some other approachs? Any advice will be appreciated! Edit Here is some of my thought: For $u_k\in L^p(\Omega), 1\leqslant p\leqslant\infty$, $u_k\to u$ in $L^p(\Omega)$, define 
$$
\langle u,\varphi\rangle=\int_{\Omega}u\varphi
$$ 
for all $\varphi\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$. We see this integral makes sense since $\varphi$ has compact support and $u$ is locally integrable. And it is a continuous linear functional on $C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$. Furthermore
$$
|\langle u_k,\varphi\rangle-\langle u,\varphi\rangle|\leqslant \int_{\Omega}|u_k-u||\varphi|\to 0
$$
by Holder's inequality. Thus we have $u_k\to u$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$. In Sobolev case we have $u_k$ tends to both $u$ and $v$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$, so $u=v$ a.e. For $u_k\in D_0^1(\Omega;a)$, $u_k\to v$ in $D_0^1(\Omega;a)$, define 
$$
\langle u,\varphi\rangle=\int_{\Omega}a^{1/2}(x)|\nabla u|\varphi.
$$
for all $\varphi\in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$. Then the integral makes sense by applying Holder's inequality. And it is also a linear continuous functional on $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$. Furthermore
$$
|\langle u_k,\varphi\rangle-\langle v,\varphi\rangle|\leqslant \int_{\Omega}a^{1/2}(x)|\nabla u_k-\nabla u||\varphi|\to 0
$$
by Holder's inequality. So we have $u_k \to v$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$, which implies $u=v$ a.e. And this answers my question why $\psi=\varphi$ a.e. Is there something wrong in my ""proof""? Or some better approaches? Thanks! Edit $$

seems only mean $a^{1/2}(x)|\nabla u|\to a^{1/2}(x)|\nabla v|$ in $\mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$, and this says nothing about my question I think! Could any one help me?","['sobolev-spaces', 'partial-differential-equations', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

I just accidentally came up with an example of a ring $R$ with a proper subring $S$ such that $R\cong S$ as rings. I may be mistaken, but I think this is the first such example I've ever come across. The example is this. $R$ is the ring of $\mathbb Z\times \mathbb Z$-matrices over $\mathbb R$ with finite-support columns, and $S$ is the subring of matrices with zeroes in all places indexed by at least one negative number. Then $S$ is isomorphic to the ring of $\mathbb N\times\mathbb N$-matrices over $\mathbb R$. But then $R$ is isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the direct sum of $\aleph_0$ copies of $\mathbb R$ and $S$ is too. I would like to know if there are other examples of such rings and if it has anything to do with the rings being Dedekind-infinite.

It is mentioned in Atiyah in p. 31 that the map $\alpha \mapsto f(\alpha) \otimes g(\alpha)$ is a ring homomorphism $A \rightarrow D$. However, it seems to me that this map does not preserve addition, since $\alpha+\alpha' \mapsto f(\alpha+\alpha') \otimes g(\alpha+\alpha')$ and the latter quantity is not equal (seemingly) to $f(\alpha) \otimes g(\alpha) + f(\alpha') \otimes g(\alpha')$.

141063,Quotient of an affine variety by a finite group coincides with topological quotient as a point set?,"I have just read the construction of the quotient of a closed subset $X$ of affine space by a finite group $G$ of automorphisms of $X$, in Shafarevich, Basic Algebraic Geometry I . Shafarevich gives this construction: Replacing the elements of $G$ by their pullbacks, $G$ becomes a group of automorphisms of the coordinate ring $k[X]$.  Then the ring of invariants, $k[X]^G$, is a finitely generated $k$-algebra (we know this from the theory of invariants), and it contains no nilpotents because it is a subring of $k[X]$. Therefore, it is the coordinate ring of some closed $Y\subset\mathbb{A}^n$. Define $X/G=Y$. The quotient map $f:X\rightarrow Y=X/G$ is characterized by having the inclusion $k[Y]=k[X]^G\hookrightarrow k[X]$ as a pullback. Shafarevich convinced me that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ with  $x_1,x_2\in X$ if and only if $\exists g\in G$ such that $gx_1=x_2$. This shows that $\operatorname{im}f$ parametrizes the orbits of $X$ under the $G$-action. The question I still have, though, is why it should be that $\operatorname{im}f$ exhausts $Y$. Since $k[X]^G\hookrightarrow k[X]$ is an injection, it is clear why $\operatorname{im}f$ needs to be dense in $Y$; but in order for this notion of quotient to coincide with my more familiar topological notion, I would like to be sure that it actually exhausts it. So, How can we be sure that $\operatorname{im}f=Y$? Here is an equivalent form of the same question, which I am finding it easier to think about. The points of $X,Y$ can be identified with maximal ideals of $k[X],k[Y]$. If I am thinking about this correctly, then for any regular map $g:X\rightarrow Y$, $g(x_0)=y_0$ if and only if $\mathfrak{x_0}$ contains $g^*(\mathfrak{y_0})$, where $\mathfrak{x_0},\mathfrak{y_0}$ are the maximal ideals of $k[X],k[Y]$ corresponding to $x_0\in X,y_0\in Y$. Thus $y_0\in \operatorname{im}g$ if and only if $g^*(\mathfrak{y_0})$ is contained in some maximal ideal of $k[X]$, i.e. it does not generate the unit ideal in $k[X]$. So the above question can be restated: How can we be sure that $k[X]^G$ does not have any maximal ideals that generate the unit ideal of $k[X]$? Is it because if a unit of $k[X]$ is $G$-invariant, then its inverse is also $G$-invariant? Note: I am fairly new to algebraic geometry, so please do not answer in the language of schemes if possible. I am conversant with commutative algebra at the level of Atiyah-Macdonald. EDIT : As often happens to me on this website, as I wrote out my question I got some new ideas. I now think I can prove what I want if the characteristic of the ground field $k$ does not divide the group order $|G|$. But I hope the surjectivity of $f:X\rightarrow X/G$ doesn't depend on this, so I still very much want to hear your answers. My argument is this: Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be any ideal of $k[X]^G$. Suppose that $\mathfrak{a}$ generates the unit ideal in $k[X]$. Then there is some equation $$1=u_1a_1+\dots+u_ma_m$$ where $a_1,\dots,a_m\in \mathfrak{a}\subset k[X]^G$ and $u_1,\dots,u_m\in k[X]$. If $\operatorname{char} k \nmid |G|$, then $|G|$ is a nonzero element of $k$, so we can average the above equation across $G$, to obtain $$1=u_1'a_1+\dots+u_m'a_m$$ where $u_j'=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} gu_j$, since $1$ and all the $a_j$'s are fixed under action of $G$. But then $u_1',\dots,u_m'\in k[X]^G$, so that actually $\mathfrak{a}$ must already have been the unit ideal of $k[X]^G$. How can the reliance on the condition $\operatorname{char}k\nmid |G|$ be removed? Is a totally different argument needed?","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'invariant-theory']"

$$S_{n} = \sum _{i=1}^{i=\dfrac{\left(n+1\right)} {2}}\dfrac {\left( n-i\right) \left( n-\left( n-i\right) \right) } {\dfrac {\left(n+1\right) } {2}} = \sum _{i=1}^{i=\dfrac{\left(n+1\right)} {2}}2i\left(\dfrac {n-i} {n+1}\right)$$
so 
$$\lim _{n\rightarrow \infty } \dfrac {S_{n}}{n^{2}} = \lim _{n\rightarrow \infty } \sum _{i=1}^{i=\dfrac{\left(n+1\right)} {2}}\dfrac{2i}{n^{2}}\left(\dfrac {n-i} {n+1}\right)$$ I am unsure how to proceed from here to show the result. Any help would be much appreciated.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"
141154,Fourier transform on $\mathbb{R}^3$,"I've been stuck on this one homework problem for nearly a day now, so I'd be really thankful for any pointers. The problem is to find
$$\int\int\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{1}{\mathbf{x}^2+1}e^{-2\pi i (x_1\zeta_1+x_2\zeta_2+x_3\zeta_3)}dx_1dx_2dx_3$$
where $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^3$. I'm not sure how to go about this; I know that the Fourier transform of $1/(1+x^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is $\pi e^{-2\pi |\zeta|}$, but I don't think that helps at all. I've tried changing it to spherical coordinates as well. Also, if anyone could briefly explain how this relates to solving the equation $u(x)-\Delta u(x)=f(x)$, $x\in \mathbb{R}^3$ and $\Delta$ being the Laplacian operator, I'd be eternally grateful.","['fourier-analysis', 'complex-analysis']"

141175,Computing degree and ramification indices for given morphism of irreducible smooth curves in $\mathbb P^2$,"Let $V = Z(X_0^8 + X_1^8 + X_2^8) $ and $W = Z(X_0^4 + X_1^4 + X_2^4)$ in $\mathbb P^2$. It can be shown that $V$ and $W$ are irreducible curves. Let $\phi : V \to W, (X_i) \mapsto (X_i^2)$ be a morphism. I want to show that $V$ and $W$ are smooth, compute $\mathrm{deg}(\phi)$ and find $e_P(\phi)$ for all $P \in V$. I'm getting in a mess though, and would appreciate some feedback on the following: First consider $V$ and work in the affine chart $\{X_0 \neq 0 \}$ i.e $V_0 = Z(1 + x^8 + y^8)$. Let $h = x^8 - (y^8 + 1)$. We see that $\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = 8x^7$ and $\frac{\partial h}{\partial y} = 8y^7$. If $(x_0, y_0)$ is a point in $V_0$, and $x_0 \neq 0$ then $y - y_0$ is a local parameter. If $y_0 \neq 0$ then $x - x_0$ is a local parameter. $(0,0)$ is not on the curve so all points in $V_0$ are smooth. Now work in the affine chart $\{X_1 \neq 0 \}$, i.e. $V_1 = Z(w^8 + 1 + y^8)$. It's easy to see that the exact same thing happens here: if $(w_0, y_0)$ is a point then $y - y_0$ is a local parameter if $w_0 \neq 0$ and $w - w_0$ is a local parameter if $y_0 \neq 0$. The curve is smooth at every point in $V_1$. The same happens in $V_2$, and also in $W_0, W_1$ and $W_2$. So suppose $p = (x_0, y_0) \in V_0$ and $\phi : V_0 \to W_0$, $(x_0,y_0) \mapsto (x_0^2, y_0^2)$. If $x_0 \neq 0$, then $x_0^2 \neq 0$ and so $t = y - y_0^2$ is a local parameter at $\phi(p)$. Then $t \phi : (x, y) \mapsto y^2 - y_0^2$. We want to find $\nu_p(t \phi)$, noting that a local parameter of $p$ is $y - y_0$. So $e_p(\phi) = \nu_p(t\phi) = \nu_p((y+y_0)(y - y_0)) = 1$. If instead $y_0 \neq 0$, then $t = x - x_0^2$ is a local parameter at $\phi(p)$ and again we get $e_p(\phi) = 1$. Is it valid to then say that by symmetry $e_p(\phi) = 1$ for all $p \in V$? I can't see why not, but this doesn't seem to give the correct result, since (by the Finiteness Theorem) it would imply that all the sizes of the pre-images are the same, which doesn't look to be true. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks",['algebraic-geometry']

141198,A net version of dominated convergence?,"Let $G$ be a locally compact Hausdorff Abelian topological group.  Let $\mu$ be a Haar measure on $G$, i.e. a regular translation invariant measure.  Let $f$ be fixed in $\mathcal{L}^1(G, \mu)$.  Define the function from $G$ to $\mathcal{L}^1(G)$ that assigns to each $y$ in $G$ the function that takes $x$ in $G$ to $f(xy^{-1})$.  I.e. it assigns the $y$-translate of $f$.  Is this a continuous function of $y$ into $\mathcal{L}^1$? On p.94 3.10 of these notes it is asserted that it is.  The usual proof of this sort of thing in cases where $G=\mathbb{R}$, say, is you use density of compactly supported continuous functions, and then dominated convergence.  The former survives, but dominated convergence does not work on nets.  In fact, a limit of a net of measurable functions need not be measurable.","['topological-groups', 'measure-theory', 'harmonic-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'locally-compact-groups']"

141212,Eigenvalues for $3\times 3$ stochastic matrices,"This is a plot of the non-real eigenvalues of $10^4$ randomly 
generated $3\times3$ stochastic matrices. It's pretty clear
that they lie in the convex hull of the three cube roots of unity. The boundary on the left hand side is easy to explain. If the 
stochastic matrix $P$ has a non-real eigenvalue $\lambda$, then 
$\text{trace}(P)=\lambda+\bar\lambda+1=2\text{Re}(\lambda)+1$.
On the other hand, the trace of $P$ is 
also the sum of its diagonal entries, and hence 
is non-negative real number. Therefore, $\text{Re}(\lambda)\geq -{1\over 2}$. I hope that there is an easy explanation for the other 2 sides of 
the triangle, perhaps in terms of some other matrix invariant. 
So far, I can't think of any. Any ideas? By the way, it is not hard to show that every point in 
the triangle can be achieved as the eigenvalue of 
a stochastic matrix of the form
$$P=\begin{bmatrix}1-s-t&s&t\\ t&1-s-t&s\\ s&t&1-s-t \end{bmatrix}$$

Exact sequences are ubiquitous - and I've encountered them enough to know that they can provide a very useful and efficient framework to work within. However, I have no idea what this framework truly is, or why it is effective. So, my questions are: What makes exact sequences natural objects to deal with? What do they encode, generally speaking? Or if you are unable to think of a satisfactory answer in general, what are some specific examples of exact sequences encoding some desirable property? Please set me straight! It seems like all of the references that I've come across only encyclopedically develop the idea of an exact sequence, sparing the reader of any qualification or exposition.","['abstract-algebra', 'homological-algebra', 'category-theory', 'commutative-algebra', 'abelian-categories']"
