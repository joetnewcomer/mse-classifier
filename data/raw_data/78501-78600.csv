1004275,Is area under an integral limit exact or an approximation?,"Suppose we need to calculate the area of the the curve $y=sin x$. Then we calculate the area  enclosed by the curve from $x=x_1$ to $x=x_2$ as $\int_{x_1}^{x_2}sin x\, dx$. Is the area calculated so exact or approximate?. In case of a linear curve such $y=ax+b$, we do get an exact value (as justified by geometry) This confusion stems from the question whether limits are exact or not (and hence all operations related to limits). Note: I did see other posts to see an answer, but none of them were complete or the questions were something else entirely. So this is not a duplicate.","['definite-integrals', 'integration']"
1004277,rational quartic in $\mathbb{P}^3$,"According to Hartshorne (exercise IV.6.1), a rational curve of degree 4 in $\mathbb{P}^3$ is contained in a unique smooth quadric surface. If this is the case, then it must define a divisor on it. My question is, what is the type of this divisor? It looks like it must be of type $(1,3)$ (by the following example) but I do not know how to show this in general. One can work out an example where the quadric is $\{xw-yz=0\}$ and the quartic is $$\{xw-yz=0,wy^2-xz^2=0,z^3-w^2y=0,y^3-x^2z=0\}.$$ This intersects $\{x=0,z=0\}$ with multiplicity $1$ and $\{x=0,y=0\}$ with multiplicity $3$, so we get type $(1,3)$ (which is rather surprising, because I thought we must get $(2,2)$ by symmetry). In general, I can see that it can only be of type $(2,2)$ or $(1,3)$, but do not see how to rule out $(2,2)$.","['intersection-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

1004341,Ring of polynomials as a module over symmetric polynomials,"Consider the ring of polynomials $\mathbb{k} [x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n]$ as a module over the ring of symmetric polynomials $\Lambda_{\mathbb{k}}$. Is $\mathbb{k} [x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n]$ a free $\Lambda_{\mathbb{k}}$-module?
  Can you write down ""good"" generators explicitly? (I think that it has to be something very classical in representation theory). Comment:
My initial question was whether this module flat. But since all flat Noetherian modules over polynomial ring are free (correct me if it is wrong), it is the same question. There is much more general question, which seems unlikely to have good answer. Let $G$ be a finite group and $V$ finite dimensional representation of G. Consider projection $p: V \rightarrow V/G$.

Problem 6(a): Let $m$ , $n$ , $p$ , $q$ be integers such that $n>0$ , $q>0$ , and $r = m/n = p/q$ . Then [I've managed to] prove that $$ b^{m/n} = b^{p/q}.$$ So we can reasonably define $b^r$ as $$b^r \colon = \sqrt[n]{b^m}.$$ Problem 6(b) [From this definition we can] prove that $$ b^{r+s} = b^r \cdot b^s, $$ where $r$ and $s$ are any rational numbers. Problem 6(c): Now for a rational number $r$ , let the set $B(r)$ be defined as follows: $$B(r) \colon= \{ \, b^t \colon \, t\in \mathbb{Q}, \, t \leq r \, \}. $$ Then it is clear that $$b^r = \sup B(r).$$ So for every real $x$ , we can define $b^x$ as follows: $$b^x \colon= \sup B(x) = \sup \big\{ \, b^t \, \colon \, t \in \mathbb{Q}, \, t \leq x \, \big\}. $$ Problem 6(d): Using this definition, (we are required to) prove that, for every pair of real $x$ and $y$ , the equation $$b^{x+y} = b^x \cdot b^y$$ holds. My Attempt: If $r$ , $s \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $r \leq x$ and $s \leq y$ , then $r+s \in \mathbb{Q}$ also and $r+s \leq x+y$ so that we can write $$ B(x) \cdot B(y)  = \{ \, b^r \cdot b^s \, \colon \, r \in \mathbb{Q}, s\in \mathbb{Q}, \, r \leq x, s\leq y \, \} \subseteq \{ \, b^t \, \colon \, t \in \mathbb{Q}, \, t \leq x+y \, \} = B(x+y),$$ and hence $$b^x \cdot b^y = \sup B(x) \cdot \sup B(y) = \sup \{ \, b^r \, \colon \, r \in \mathbb{Q}, \, r \leq x \, \} \cdot \sup \{ \, b^s \, \colon \, s \in \mathbb{Q}, \, s \leq y \, \} = sup \{ \, b^{r+s} \, \colon \, r \in \mathbb{Q}, \, s\in \mathbb{Q}, \,  r \leq x, \, s \leq y \, \} \leq \sup \{ \, b^t \, \colon \, t \in \mathbb{Q}, \, t \leq x+y \, \} = \sup B(x+y) = b^{x+y}.$$ Here we have used the following definition: Given two non-empty sets $U$ and $V$ , say of real numbers, we define the set $U \cdot V$ as follows: $$U \cdot V \colon= \{ \, u \cdot v \, \colon \, u \in U, \, v \in V \, \}.$$ And we have also used the fact that if $W$ and $Z$ are two non-empty bounded above subsets of the set of positive real numbers such that $W \subseteq Z$ , then we must have $$ \sup W \leq \sup Z.$$ So far, we have shown that $$b^x \cdot b^y \leq b^{x+y}.$$ Now how to prove the reverse inequality using the machinery developed above?

My attempt at showing $|<a>| = m \implies m$ is the smallest positive integer such that $a^{m} = e$: The only thing I can really work with is that $<a> = \{a^{i} | i \in \mathbb{Z}\}$, so certainly the set $\{e,a,a^{2},...,a^{m-1}\}$$\subset$ $<a>$, and furthermore we can require that each $a^{j} \in \{e,a,a^{2},...,a^{m-1}\}$ is distinct (i.e. no $a^{j} = a^{n}$ unless $j\equiv n$, $mod$ $m$), and that the set size is $m$.

1004990,Double induction,"Hi I'm studying Introduction to Set Theory by Hrbacek and Jech and I am not sure if I am doing a certain problem correctly.

Conclude that $P(m,n)$ holds for all $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$. Now, my interpretation of this is that

(*) \,\,\,\,\forall k,l \in \mathbb{N} [k < m \vee (k=m \wedge l<n) \to P(k,l)] \to P(m,n)

\forall k,l \in \mathbb{N} [k < m \to P(k,l)] \to P(m,n) \,.

as desired. Is this proof valid? The fact that the problem is titled ""Double Induction"" leads me to believe that I have made a mistake somewhere since I only had too use induction once. Any guidance here is appreciated.",['elementary-set-theory']

Erdos proved in 1965 that for any set $A$ of nonzero integers, there exists a sumfree $B\subset A$ such that $|B|>|A|/3$ . Specifically, I am having trouble understanding a detail in a proof of this theorem. The proof I am referring to occurs in the first section of Additive Combinatorics by Tao & Vu (pg. 4) and in section 20.2 of Extremal Combinatorics With Applications In Computer Science by Jukna (pgs. 246-247). Here are snapshots I took of the proofs from each book (Tao & Vu first, then Jukna's proof): The thing I do not get is the stipulation for the size of $p$ . In Jukna's book, it is required that $p>2\max_i|a_i|$ where the $a_i$ are the elements of $A$ . In Tao & Vu it is required that $A\subset[-p/3,p/3]$ . Firstly, why do we need $p$ to be large at all? Does this affect the probabilities in any way? Secondly, clearly the ""largeness"" of $p$ varies in the two books and yet still the proofs work, so I'd like to understand what restrictions on the size of $p$ is really essential. These sizes don't seem to be mentioned in the proofs after they are stated, so I know I must be missing something.

Reply (Nov 5) to Greg's and mixedmath's answers/comments Thanks for your answers/comments. $P(n)$ has the bounds you mention and it is irregular but I do not understand how boundedness and irregularity imply the non-existence of an asymptotic formula for $P(n)$, if that is what you are saying. The boundedness of $P(n)$ does not determine its behavior within those bounds and $P(n)$ may have quite a lot of regularity depending on its domain. For example, a domain of $P(n)$ can be constructed as follows: Let $X$   be the set of square-free Naturals with $k$ prime factors. Let $X_j $ be the subset of $X$ such that $P(n) = p_j $, the j-th prime, and where $j \geq k$. The cardinal number of this set will be finite and will depend on $j$  and $k$ . Let $ X'_j $  be the subset of $X_j$ consisting of members of $X_j$ that are greater than any member of the sets $X_1, X_2,\dots,X_{j-1} $ . This ensures the sets $ X'_j $  are disjoint and the members of each set of the sequence are greater than the members of any previous set. The set $ X'_j$ will be non-empty and have a finite cardinal number. Let $ X''_j $ be the set  $ X'_j $ ordered by size. Then $P(n)$ on the domain {$ {X''_1, X''_2 \dots}$}   will be an increasing step function. The length of a step will depend on $j$  and $k$ and the height of a step will be the $ j $ th  prime gap. $ P(n)$  on this domain has quite a lot of regularity.","['reference-request', 'number-theory']"
1005081,Dense sets in a subset of $\mathbb{R}$,"$\def\Irr{\operatorname{Irr}}$
Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the space of real numbers. If $A$ is a dense set in $\mathbb{R}$ and $B \subset \mathbb{R}$. We know that $A\cap B$ need not be dense in $B$. By dense sets in $B$, I mean $\overline{A\cap B}=B$. For example, take $A=\mathbb{Q}$ ""the set of all rational numbers"", and take $B=\left\{1\right\}\cup \Irr$, where $\Irr$ is the set of all irrational numbers. Then it is clear that $A$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$; however, $A\cap B$ is not dense in $B$. My question is that: Under what conditions, the statement will be true; i.e. when $A\cap B$ will be dense in $B$, if  $A$ is a dense in $\mathbb{R}$?","['general-topology', 'complex-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
1005105,What is the minimum number of vertices needed to represent a solid of genus $n$ in $\Bbb R^3$?,"The image below shows a $9$-vertex polyhedron that is topologically equivalent to a torus, and hence has genus $1$. The question is: what is the smallest number of vertices needed to represent a surface of genus $n$ in $\Bbb R^3$? Self-intersections are allowed, although I doubt they are necessary in any minimal examples. Labelling this as $f(n)$, this example shows that $f(1)\le9$ and obviously $f(0)=4$ (a tetrahedron is topologically equivalent to a sphere, and nothing smaller is non-planar. I claim that $f(1)=9$, i.e. there are no smaller 
polygons than the one above that maintain homeomorphism to a torus, although I don't see how to prove it. Can you generalize these two examples to an $n$-genus solid and get a bound on $f(n)$? Lower bounds seem quite hard to prove, though. Edit in response to some of the comments: I believe that this problem can be tackled purely combinatorially, as my answer below hints at. The question boils down to this: Given a set $F$ of ""oriented"" three-element sets (i.e. ordered only up to cyclic permutation), define $V=\bigcup F$ and $E$ as the set of two-element subsets of some $f\in F$. This defines the set of vertices, edges, and faces. That this constitutes a polygon is the demand that every $\{e_1,e_2\}\in E$ is a subset of exactly two elements of $F$, once in the same direction as the cycle and once in the opposite direction, and the genus of the resulting surface can be calculated from $|V|-|E|+|F|=2-2g$. The orientation of elements of $F$ ensures that the resulting polygon is orientable, and then we can simply ask what is the smallest $k$ such that there exists such an arrangement with $|V|=k$ and $g=n$. This mapping is justified by the classification theorem for closed surfaces, which says that the above conditions imply that the polyhedron is homeomorphic to a set of disconnected multiple tori of various genuses. And noting that one can connect the pieces by replacing two triangles on each surface with a triangular prism (which lowers the overall Euler characteristic by $2$), we see that under the reasonable assumption that $f(n)$ is non-decreasing, it follows that any minimal $k$ satisfying the combinatorial assumptions must describe a connected $n$-torus, which was our original goal.","['general-topology', 'graph-theory', 'combinatorics']"

1005162,Could characters in harmonic analysis be generalized into $S^2$?,"Consider a locally compact abelian (LCA) group $G$. The start of commutative harmonic analysis is the fact that the collection of characters $\chi : G \to S^1$ (thought of as $S^1 = \mathbb{T} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$) form an LCA group themselves under pointwise multiplication, and additionally the relationship between $G$ and $\widehat{G}$ is a duality (the Pontryagin duality). The notion of characters is similarly defined for Banach algebras, where they are non-trivial multiplicative linear functionals. If we consider the group algebra $L^1(G)$ under a Haar measure with convolution for the product, then the use of the group structure in convolution allows us put characters $\mathcal{M}(L^1(G))$ on $L^1(G)$ (here $\mathcal{M}$ stands for the maximal ideal space of $L^1(G)$) and characters $\widehat{G}$ on $G$ in direct correspondence. In particular, to every character $\psi \in \mathcal{M}(L^1(G))$ there is some $\chi_\psi \in \widehat{G}$ such that $$\psi(f) = \int_G f(x) \ \overline{\chi_\psi (x)} \ d\mu(x).$$ Then the Gelfand transform, which transforms an object in a Banach algebra into a decaying continuous function on the space of characters of the algebra, is precisely the Fourier transform on $L^1(G)$, which decomposes an integrable function into its effect on characters of $G$. It seems as though there are many directions that one can take this. If commutative Lie groups are all that one is concerned with, these can be exhausted rather quickly to form classical Fourier transforms (the transform on $\mathbb{R}$, discrete Fourier transform, and Fourier series). One can then proceed to talk about noncommutative harmonic analysis where the trace of representations (from where we derive characters) is no longer a group, or you can investigate the connection with the Laplacian and just look at the Laplacian on a general manifold. When looking at this whole thing however, one gets a little tingling feeling that the characters going from $G \to S^1$ feels like homotopy. Of course we desperately need the group structure on $S^1$, and this is precisely what higher dimensional structures like $S^n$ lack. On the other hand, $S^2$ can be identified with the Riemann sphere. Although this isn't a group and doesn't have some immediate ""structure"", it does have ties (so to speak) with $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{C}^\times$ that makes it more significant than arbitrary $S^n$. My question is this: Is there some generalization of a character that maps in some (possibly vague) way to $S^2$, that generalizes some of the things about harmonic analysis summarized here?","['complex-analysis', 'harmonic-analysis', 'lie-groups', 'abstract-algebra']"
1005193,Expected value of inverse of a random variable,"My problem is as follows: I have a point $A$ and a circle with center $B$ and radius $R$.

My question is how to calculate the expected value of $AC^{-4}$.

Denote $r$ as the distance of BC then distribution of $r$ in $[0,R]$ is $\frac{2r}{R^2}$. Using the formula $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2AB\times BC \times \cos\theta$ , I have \begin{align}

1005619,The derivative as a linear transform,"I'm having trouble wrapping my head around thinking about the derivative as a linear transform. Here is an example I came up with to try and understand it better. Let $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ be defined by $f(x,y) = (x+y,xy,x^2-y^2)$ Then the derivative of $f$ at $\vec{x_0} = \left[\matrix{
   x_0 \cr
   y_0 \cr
}\right]$ is given by: $f'_\vec{x_0} = \left[\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{1}&{1}\\
{y_0}&{x_0}\\
{2x_0}&{-2y_0}\\
\end{array}\right]
$ This means that $f'_\vec{x_0}$ is the linear transformation that takes a vector $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and sends it to $f'_\vec{x_0}\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^3$. Here are my questions: How do I interpret the derivative in higher dimensions? In one dimension we can think of the derivative as the slope of a tangent line. Is there a similar notion for higher dimensions? I'm looking at the above matrix and trying to attach some meaning to it, but I can't come up with anything. What does  $f'_\vec{x_0}\vec{v}$ represent? Is it just the derivative of $f$ at $\vec{x_0}$ in the direction of $\vec{v}$? Do the components of this vector represent how fast $f$ is changing along each axis?","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"

Then I've managed to show that (a) $E$ is not countable, and (b) $E$ is not dense in $[0,1]$. How to determine if $E$ is closed (and hence compact)? And, if closed, then how to determine if $E$ is perfect? My effort: Suppose $y \in [0,1] - E$, and let $n$ be the smallest natural number such that the $n$th digit after the decimal point $d_n$ in the decimal expansion of $y$ is neither $4$ nor $7$. Let us take $\epsilon$ such that $$0 < \epsilon < \frac{\min (|d_n-4|, |d_n-7|)}{10^{n+1}}. $$ Then is it true that this $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $y$ contains no point of $E$? If so, then how to show this fact rigorously? If this holds, then of course no point $y$ not in $E$ can be a limit point of $E$, implying that $E$ is closed. To see if $E$ is perfect, let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $E$, and let the decimal expansion of $x$ be as follows: $$x \colon = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{d_i}{10^i}, $$ where each $d_i$ is either $4$ or $7$. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. Let's choose $n$ such that $$ \frac{4}{10^{n}} < \epsilon.$$ Now we can find an element $y$ of $E$ whose decimal expansion is given by $$ y \colon = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{d^\prime_i}{10^i}, $$ where $$d^\prime_i \colon= \begin{cases} d_i \mbox{ if } i \neq n; \\ 4 \mbox{ if  } i =n \mbox{ and } d_n = 7; \\ 7 \mbox{ if } i=n \mbox{ and  } d_n = 4.\end{cases} $$ Then evidently, we have $$d(x,y) = \frac{3}{10^n} < \epsilon, $$ and moreover $y \in E$ and $y \neq x$.

So I start with the simplest case of vectors. Here's my own attempt, please bear with me: Suppose that $V$ is a vector space and $\alpha=\{v_1,\cdots,v_n\}$ and $\beta = \{w_1,\cdots,w_n\}$ are two ordered bases for $V$. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ give rise to the dual bases $\alpha^*=\{v^1,\cdots,v^n\}$ and $\beta^*=\{w^1,\cdots,w^n\}$ for $V^*$ respectively. If $[T]_{\beta}^{\alpha}=[\lambda_{i}^{j}]$ is the matrix representation of coordinate transformation from $\alpha$ to $\beta$, i.e. $$\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ \vdots \\ w_n \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1^1 & \lambda_1^2 & \dots &\lambda_1^n \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \lambda_n^1 & \lambda_n^2 & \cdots & \lambda_n^n\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix}$$ What is the matrix of coordinate transformation from $\alpha^*$ to $\beta^*$? We can write $w^j \in \beta^*$ as a linear combination of basis elements in $\alpha^*$: $$w^j=\mu_{1}^{j}v^1+\cdots+\mu_n^{j}v^n$$ We get a matrix representation $[S]_{\beta^*}^{\alpha^*}=[\mu_{i}^{j}]$ as the following: $$\begin{bmatrix} w^1 & \cdots & w^n \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} v^1 & \cdots & v^n \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \mu_1^1 & \mu_1^2 & \dots &\mu_1^n \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \mu_n^1 & \mu_n^2 & \cdots & \mu_n^n\end{bmatrix} $$ We know that $w_i = \lambda_{i}^1v_1+\cdots+\lambda_{i}^nv_n$.
Evaluating this functional at $w_i \in V$ we get: $$w^j(w_i)=\mu_{1}^{j}v^1(w_i)+\cdots+\mu_n^{j}v^n(w_i)=\delta_{i}^j$$
$$w^j(w_i)=\mu_{1}^{j}v^1(\lambda_{i}^1v_1+\cdots+\lambda_{i}^nv_n)+\cdots+\mu_n^{j}v^n(\lambda_{i}^1v_1+\cdots+\lambda_{i}^nv_n)=\delta_{i}^j$$
$$w^j(w_i)=\mu_{1}^{j}\lambda_{i}^1+\cdots+\mu_n^{j}\lambda_{i}^n=\sum_{k=1}^n\mu_{k}^j \lambda_{i}^k=\delta_{i}^j$$ But $\sum_{k=1}^n\mu_{k}^j \lambda_{i}^k$ is the $(i,j)$ entry of the matrix product $TS$. Therefore $TS=I_n$ and $S=T^{-1}$. If we want to write down the transformation from $\alpha^*$ to $\beta^*$ as column vectors instead of row vector and name the new matrix that represents this transformation as $U$, we observe that $U=S^{t}$ and therefore $U=(T^{-1})^t$. Therefore if $T$ represents the transformation from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ by the equation $\mathbf{w}=T\mathbf{v}$, then $\mathbf{w^*}=U\mathbf{v^*}$. The important case is when $T=(T^{-1})^t$ which happens if and only if $T$ is an orthonormal transformation. What I don't understand is why the transformation from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ is called a contravariant transformation while the transformation from $\alpha^*$ to $\beta^*$ is called a covariant transformation .

1006093,Without L'Hopitals rule: $\lim_{x\rightarrow3}\frac{(x-3)\cdot\ln(x-2)}{1-\cos(3-x)}$,"$$f(x) = \frac{(x-3)\cdot\ln(x-2)}{1-\cos(3-x)}$$ Is there any procedure to solving this expression? The problem right now is the fact that $\lim_{x\rightarrow3}f(x) = [\frac{0}{0}]$ I've tried multiplying by the conjuage of the denominator so I had $$\lim_{x\rightarrow3} = \frac{(x-3)\cdot\ln(x-2)(1+\cos(3-x))}{\sin^2(3-x)}$$ But of course, that didn't do much. Wolfram tells me $\lim_{x\rightarrow3}\frac{x-3}{\sin(3-x)} = -1$, however, I'd then have to extend by another $(x-3)$ and when I tried, it didn't make it any easier.","['limits-without-lhopital', 'calculus', 'limits']"
1006101,What is the distribution of the area between a Brownian Bridge and the x-axis?,"Lets say that we have a Standard Brownian Bridge ($\sigma=1$) with endpoints $(0,0),(1,0)$ Is there a way to derive the distribution of the area between a sample path of this bridge and the x-axis?? Below is an image that represents examples of my problem. I would want the distribution of the total area colored red in both examples: Progress thus far I've come up with crude bounds based on hitting time distributions, based on a formula for the distribution of the first time a standard ($\sigma=1$) Brownian bridge on $[0,T]$ with endpoints $(0,0),(T,x)$ hits level $b$. I found the formula here (see top of page 19). $$P(\tau_b\leq T|T,x)=e^{\frac{-2b(b-x)}{T}}$$ In the interests of simplicity, I started my analysis to just the standard brownian bridge, where $T=1,x=0$, this simplifies the formula to: $$P(\tau_b\leq 1)=e^{-2b^2}$$ Ok, now let $A$ be the area between a standard brownian bridge and the x-axis. I know that $P(A\leq a) \geq P\left( \{\tau_{c}>1\} \cap \{\tau_{c-a}>1\}\right),\; 0\leq c \leq a$, which is simply the probability that the brownian bridge is contained inside a rectangle of area $a$ on $[0,T]$ such that it contains the x-axis. The $\leq$ is justified since $\sigma(\{\tau_{c}>1\} \cap \{\tau_{c-a}>1\})\subset \sigma(\{A\leq a\})$. Now, there is nothing special about any particular choice of $c$ in the above, so I'd like to integrate the RHS of above over all valid choices of $c$, for this, I need the density of $P\left( \{\tau_{c}>1\} \cap \{\tau_{c-a}>1\}\right)$ as a function of $c$. $$P\left( \{\tau_{c}>1\} \cap \{\tau_{c-a}>1\}\right) = P(\tau_{c-a}>1)P(\tau_{c}>1|\tau_{c-a}>1)=\left(1-e^{-2(c-a)^2}\right)P(\tau_{c}>1|\tau_{c-a}>1)=\left(1-e^{-2(c-a)^2}\right)\left(1-P(\tau_{c}\leq 1|\tau_{c-a}> 1)\right)$$ The conditional probability measure $P(\tau_{c}\leq 1|\tau_{c-a}> 1)$ stops me from getting anywhere with this approach. Question Can the conditional measure $P(\tau_{c}>1|\tau_{c-a}>1)$ be derived? Is there another route to getting the distribution function of the area bounded by the standard brownian bridge?","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'stopping-times', 'brownian-motion']"
1006111,Finding the limit $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n\left(\sqrt[n]{n}-1\right)}{\log n}$,"I try to calculate the following limit:
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n\left(\sqrt[n]{n}-1\right)}{\log n}$$
I think it should equal 1, because:
$$\exp(x)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n}$$
(Already proven) Solving for $x$ gives:
$$
\log x = \lim_{n \to \infty} n \left(\sqrt[n]{x}-1\right)
\implies \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n\left(\sqrt[n]{n}-1\right)}{\log n}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log n}{\log n}=1
$$
But I like to calculate the limit with just standard things like L’Hôpital’s rule, because the previous way is maybe wrong and contains too much magic. For example, I tried this:
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n\left(\sqrt[n]{n}-1\right)}{\log n}
&= \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\frac{d}{dn}\!\!\left(n\left(\sqrt[n]{n}-1\right)\right)}{\frac{d}{dn}\log n} \\[6pt]
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n^{1/n-1}\left(-\left(\log\left(n\right)-1\right)\right)+n^{1/n}-1}{1/n} \\[6pt]
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(n\left(n^{1/n-1}\left(-\left(\log\left(n\right)-1\right)\right)+n^{1/n}-1\right)\right) \\[6pt]
&=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(n^{1/n}\left(-\left(\log\left(n\right)-1\right)\right)+n^{1/n+1}-n\right) \\[6pt]
&=???
\end{align*}
$$
But then it becomes really ugly and looks wrong. Have I done something wrong? Is there another way to find the limit? Thank you for any ideas.","['exponential-function', 'logarithms', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"
1006116,Differential Equations Question involving a spring-mass system,"I'm working through a Differential Equations book and came across a question that puzzles me: ""Consider a spring-mass system where there are two masses connected in series by springs, with each spring having a different constant ($k_1$ and $k_2$)"" (set up like this): |<><>($m_1$)<><>($m_2$) Where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses, and $k_1$ and $k_2$ would be the spring constants. The position of each mass is given by $x_1$ and $x_2$. It asks to show that (using $F=ma$) the system can be described by this pair of DEs:
\begin{align}
m_1\ddot{x}_1 &= -(k_1+k_2)x_1 + k_2x_2\\
m_2\ddot{x}_2 &= k_2x_1 - k_2x_2
\end{align} and then reduce these to a single equation for the position of mass 2 ($x_2$). Any suggestions on how to get these equations?
