1470576,"Turn a group representation into a $\mathbb C[G]$-module, is the new multiplication an extension of the old one","In these lecture notes by Daniel Bump the $\mathbb C[G]$-module of a group representation is contructed the following way. If $G$ is a finite (possible non-abelian) group, then the group algebra $\mathbb C[G]$ is the set of functions $f : G \to \mathbb C$ with the convolution product
$$
 (f_1 \ast f_2)(x) := \sum_{\begin{array}{c} y,z \in G \\ yz = x\end{array}} f_1(y)f_2(z).
$$
A (complex) representation of the group $G$ is a homomorphism $\pi : G \to GL(V)$ for some vector space $V$, denotes $(\pi, V)$. Given such a representation, we can define a multiplication $\mathbb C[G] \times V \rightarrow V$ by
$$
 f \cdot v := \sum_{g\in G} f(g) \pi(g) v.
$$
Now I am curious, reduces this multiplication to the multiplication $\mathbb C \times V \to V$  already given on the $\mathbb C$-vector space $V$? To show this I embed $\mathbb C$ into $\mathbb C[G]$ by identifying $\mathbb C \cong \{ c \cdot \overline 1 : c \in \mathbb C \}$, i.e. each element with the constant function taking this element as its constant value. For $c$ denote this constant function by $\overline c : G \to \mathbb C$, and compute
\begin{align*} 
 \overline c \cdot v = 
   \sum_{g\in G} \overline c(g) \pi(g) v 
   = \sum_{g\in G} c \pi(g) v
   = c \sum_{g\in G} \pi(g) v.
\end{align*}
But I have no idea how to show that $\sum_{g\in G} \pi(g) v = v$ (if this holds at all)? This is my question, does it hold and this new multiplication reduces to the old one in the vector space, and if so, how to show it?","['representation-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'finite-groups']"

1470636,How can I show that this matrix exponential has norm strictly less than one?,"Let $t,\sigma,R \in \mathbb{R^+}$.  Let

want to show that the induced $\mathcal{l}_2$ norm of $\exp(\mathrm{A} t)$ is strictly less than one. This is what I have tried. $$\exp(\mathrm{A} t) =  \exp(-R t/2) \left\lbrack\begin{array}{cc} \cosh (\omega t) + \frac{R}{2 \omega} \sinh( \omega t)& -\frac{\sigma}{\omega} \sinh(\omega t)\\

\left\lbrack\begin{array}{cc} \cosh (\omega t) + \frac{R}{2 \omega} \sinh( \omega t)& -\frac{\sigma}{\omega} \sinh(\omega t)\\
\frac{\sigma}{\omega} \sinh(\omega t) & \cosh(\omega t) - \frac{R}{2\omega} \sinh(\omega t)  \end{array} \right\rbrack
$$ has norm strictly less than $\exp(R t/2)$. This is pretty much where I am stuck. I attempted to consider if $\omega$ is purely rule or purely imaginary separately, but they were both seemingly dead ends.  I also have used the eigen decomposition of $\mathrm{A}$ but that only tells us that the matrix exponential is eventually (for large enough $t$) strictly less than 1.

1470771,$m$ and $n$ are two integers. Prove $mn+n$ is odd if and only if $m$ is even and $n$ is odd,"I get that this has to be solved as a by conditional. So first I would just solve directly: $m$ is even and $n$ is odd, so $m = 2k$ and $n = 2j+1$. Therefore $mn+n = 2(2kj+k+j)+1$, which is odd. This is where I'm getting confused. Next when you solve the the converse, by way of contrapositive you would try to prove that $mn+m$ is even if $m$ is even OR $n$ is odd. The book I'm using says that there are two cases to consider: case one : $m$ is even case two : $m$ and $n$ are both odd I don't understand why you need to do multiple cases to begin with since you are dealing with an OR state.

To prove that $2^{B}$ is a lattice I know I have to show that for any two sets $B_{1}, B_{2} \in 2^{B}$ there is a unique $A_{sup} = B_{1} \vee B_{2}$ and $A_{inf} = B_{1} \wedge B_{2}$ (is there anything else to show?). I know from set theory that the smallest superset of $B_{1}, B_{2}$ will be $B_{1} \cup B_{2}$ and the largest subset will be $B_{1} \cap B_{2}$.

(If $a,b\in G$, then there exists an injective path $\alpha$ connecting $a,b$ in $G$. Since $E$ has no limit point, there exist only finitely many poins of $E$ on the trace of $\alpha$.

1471006,Need help with technical detail in Dedekind's 1872 paper,"I found the restatement of Dedekind's construction of real numbers in Rudin quite confusing. As a German speaker, I started to read the paper by Dedekind (1872), which is very beautiful and gives a great intuition for what he is trying to achieve (an English translation of the paper is also available on the internet). However, Dedekind is a bit too ingenious for me. He constructs a cut that does not correspond to a rational number, and I have technical difficulties with the proof that the cut has this property. Let me list his assumptions and conclusions, in particular the one I don't understand: (1) He assumes that $D$ is a positive integer which is not the square of another integer. Then, he says, there exists another positive integer $\lambda$ such that
$$\lambda^{2} < D < (\lambda + 1)^{2}.$$
This claim can be accepted. (2) He assumes (by way of contradiction) that $\sqrt{D}$ is a rational number. Then there are positive integers $t,u$ such that
\begin{equation}\tag{1}
t^{2} - Du^{2} = 0.
\end{equation}
This is also fine. Moreover, he assumes $u$ to be the smallest positive integer such that for a positive integer $t$ the equation (1) is fulfilled. (3) From this follows, he argues, that
$$\lambda u < t < (1+\lambda)u,$$
and that the number $u' := t - \lambda u$ is a positive integer which is smaller than $u$. I agree with all of this. (4) Now, however, he defines a number 
$$t' = Du - \lambda t$$
and claims that $t'$ is a positive integer. Here I cannot follow him anymore. I have no idea why $t'$ should be positive. How does this follow from what he has done so far? Looking forward to hearing the answer to this personal riddle...",['number-theory']

My solution: 1) Let $f\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to E$, $f(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)=\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_ix_i$ then $C_n = f(S)$ with $S = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon \lambda \geq 0, \, \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i = 1\}$. hence $C_n$ is compact. $D=\bigcup_n C_n$ is dense because $(x_n) \subset D$. 2) I don't know how to do this. 3) $E'$ is finite dimensional and $T_n$ lives on the closed ball, then exists a subsequence $(T_{n_k})_k$ which converges to an operator $T$ with $||T||=1$.

Set $S$ is not empty because $1\in S$ and is bounded above because $2^3=8>5>x^3,\forall x\in S$, by the completeness axiom, $S$ has a least upper bound, $b$. Consider that if $b^3>5$, we can pick a small $\epsilon=(b^3-5)/(3b^2+3))$ such that $b-\epsilon<b$, then we can have $$(b-\epsilon)^3=b^3-3b^2\epsilon+3b\epsilon^2-\epsilon^3>b^3-3b^2\epsilon-3\epsilon^3>b^3-3b^2\epsilon-3\epsilon=5\tag 1$$ So $(b-\epsilon)^3>5>x^3,\forall x\in S$ which contradicts $b$ is the least upper bound. Now consider that $b^3<5$, then so we can pick a $\epsilon=(5-b^3)/(3b^2+3b+1)$ such that $b+r>b$.

1471337,Cyclically reduced words in free groups,"Let $F$ be a free group on $\{x_1,x_2,\cdots\}$, $w$ a word in $F$. Then $w$ is a finite expression in $x_i$'s and their inverses. By cancellation, $w$ can be reduced to simplest expression. Let $w=x_{i_1}x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_r}$ be a reduced word in $F$. It may happen that end letters can be inverses of each other, i.e. $x_{i_r}=x_{i_1}^{-1}$. In this case, $w$ can be written as 
$$w=x_{i_1} (x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_{r-1}})x_{i_1}^{-1}.$$
Thus, a representative, namely $(x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_{r-1}})$, of conjugacy class of $w$ is found which has length smaller than that of $w$. Continuing such process, we obtain an expression for $w$ as
$$w=h(x_j x_k\cdots x_l)h^{-1},$$
in which no cancellation can be done (or it is exactly same expression as beginning reduced form) $x_j$ and $x_l$ are not inverses of each other. This gives a minimum-length representative of conjugacy class of $w$ in $F$. Question 1. Is this minimum-length conjugacy class representative uniquely determined? (I think, it is unique by the process described). Question 2. If it is not uniquely determined, then is its length uniquely determined? I confused with following sentence on Wikipedia (and so posted above questions): Every word is conjugate to a cyclically reduced word. The cyclically reduced words are minimal-length representatives of the conjugacy classes in the free group. This representative is not uniquely determined , but it is unique up to cyclic shifts (since every cyclic shift is a conjugate element).","['group-theory', 'free-groups']"

Solution: The number of Sylow $2$ -subgroups is $1$ or $3$ . In the first case, there is a normal subgroup of order $16$ so we are done. In the second case, let $G$ act by conjugation on the Sylow $2$ -subgroups. This produces a homomorphism from $G$ into $S_3$ . Because of the action, the image cannot consist of just $2$ elements. On the other hand, since no Sylow $2$ -subgroup is normal, the kernel cannot have $16$ elements. The only possibility is that the homomorphism maps $G$ onto $S_3$ , and so the kernel is a normal subgroup of order $48 / 6 = 8$ . I don't understand parts of the second paragraph. I understand we can choose to let $G$ act on the $3$ Sylow $2$ -subgroups by conjugation.

So the $w$ mapping fails to conform where $w_n = (2n+1)\pi i$. On the $z$ plane, that corresponds to where $z_n=w_n+e^{w_n}$ or

1471636,Mathematical descriptions of physical space,"Bear with me as I'm a philosophy (not math) student. First some philosophical background, and then the math question. One philosophical view is that physical space is composed of infinitely many points of zero volume. But the question arises, how can points of zero volume add up to a non-zero finite volume? Even with an infinite number of points this seems impossible--from nothing you get nothing, no matter how many times you add nothing. The response to this question is typically an appeal to measure theory in mathematics. While the Lebesgue measure of a set containing a single point, e.g. $[1,1]$ is $0$, the Lebesgue measure of the set of points $[0,1]$ is non-zero. Hence we have what is in some sense an addition of $0$'s equaling something nonzero. Thus if it is the case that measure theory correctly describes physical space, we have an answer to our original question. Now here is my question to you guys. Are there any alternatives to measure theory which yield different results? That is, are there any instances of mathematics where the sum of an actually infinite amount of zeros (this rules out limits and sums defined in terms of limits) is $0$? One candidate to me seemed to be the hyperreal numbers from non-standard analysis. While I do not know how to formalize an ""infinite sum"" in non-standard analysis (e.g. is there a sort of measure theory equivalent in non-standard analysis?) but I can do something similar--in non-standard analysis, $0$ times infinity is always zero (right?). Whether this calculation is a better analog to physical space than measure theory is something I am skeptical of, but nonetheless it would be interesting to hear from you mathematicians about sums of zeros in non-standard analysis or other alternative mathematical tools/theories.","['infinity', 'nonstandard-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

Then because $$-K_{P_\Sigma} = \sum_{\rho} a_\rho D_\rho + D$$ where $D$ is a effective divisor, we know $-K_{P_\Sigma}$ is a big divisor.

 $$\frac{4 \cdot 3}{52 \cdot 51} = \frac{1}{221}$$ But the official solution says that the answer is:
$$\frac{4}{52}$$

$$\frac{4 \cdot 3}{52 \cdot 51} = \frac{1}{221}$$ Assuming that the 2nd card is Ace, then:
$$\frac{(52-4) \cdot 4 \cdot 3}{52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50} = \frac{24}{5525}$$ We notice a pattern here. Having the 1st Ace at the $k$'th draw, then the probability (for a second Ace after that) is:
$$
p_1 = \frac{ {_{52-4}P_{k-1}} \cdot 4 \cdot 3 }{ {_{52}P_{k-1}} \cdot {_{52-k}P_{2}} }
$$ We need to consider the least-possible scenario - we draw 48 non-Ace cards, then:
$$
p_2 = \frac{48! \cdot 4 \cdot 3}{ {_{52}P_{50}} } = \frac{1}{270725}
$$ So, the required probability is:
$$\begin{align}

Task is to find all integer solutions to equation. This is a typical example of inclusion-exclusion principle. First number of solution, which satisfy

According to the formula, we calculate all selections with repetitions from a set of 5 elements $$x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5$$ and the length of selection is $$21 -15 -1 = 5$$ hence:  $$C(5 + 5 -1, 5 ) = 126$$ Assume, that given result is the universal set of solutions in this situation $U$
Now to use the inclusion-exclusion principle, opposite conditions are counted for $$x_1 \le 3$$ and $$x_2 \le4 $$ These conditions are respectively $$x_1\ge 4, x_2\ge 5$$ To find them calculate $$C_1(5+17-1,17) = 5985$$ and $$C_2(5+16-1,16) = 4845$$

I can show that it is true for primes as follows: $x_t=0$ for $0\leq t<n$ (all $v\neq 0$ are generators of $\mathbb{Z}_n$). $x_t=t$ for $n\leq t<2n$ (all locations for $v=0$). The zero common to both parts can be eliminated for a total length of $2n-1$. And similar logic shows that the same sequence works for prime powers. I have not been able to come up with anything for odd composite numbers. What I'm hoping for is an algorithm to generate sequences given $n$, or keywords I can research to make progress on that.",['abstract-algebra']
1472517,"I just proved that $\lvert \sin(nx)\rvert \leq n \cdot \lvert \sin(x) \rvert$ for $n \geq 1$, but it's not true...what went wrong?","I was trying to prove that for $n \geq 1$ and $n = 0$, $$\lvert \sin(nx)\rvert \leq n \cdot \lvert \sin(x) \rvert$$ Turns out it's actually not true...but I don't know why. My proof seems reasonable to me, please help me find the problem(s). EDIT : This is for real numbers $n$ $\\$ Proof : Since we're interested in the absolute value of $\sin(nx)$ we only have to consider $nx$ over the interval $[0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, because any angle $kz \gt \frac{\pi}{2}$ can be expressed as $nx$ such that $\lvert \sin(nx) \rvert = \lvert \sin(kz) \rvert$. We know that the rate of change of $\sin(x)$ with respect to $x$ decreases continuously as $x$ increases, for $x$ over $[0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$. We also know that any angle $nx$ can be broken into the sum of $x$ and  $(nx - x)$. Therefore we know that $$\frac{\sin(x)}{x} \geq \frac{\sin(nx) - \sin(x)}{nx - x}$$ In other words, since $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \sin(x)$ is continuously decreasing over the interval $[0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, the slope over the interval $[0,x]$ is always greater than or equal to the slope over $[x, nx]$. From this, we get $$nx \cdot \sin(x) - x \cdot \sin(x) \geq x \cdot \sin(nx) - x \cdot \sin(x)$$ $$nx \cdot \sin(x) \geq x \cdot \sin(nx)$$ $$n \cdot \sin(x) \geq \sin(nx)$$ $\\$ I'm pretty sure what's wrong is my first assumption that: Since we're interested in the absolute value of $\sin(nx)$ we only have to consider $nx$ over the interval $[0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, because any angle $kz \gt (\frac{\pi}{2})$ can be expressed as $nx$ such that $\lvert \sin(nx) \rvert = \lvert \sin(kz) \rvert$. But I'm not sure exactly why. I'd really appreciate an explanation of why this part or others of my proof are wrong. EDIT : A second question I have is whether my proof would actually work if we did indeed constain $nx$ to $[0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$. What about constraining just $x$ to $[0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$","['calculus', 'proof-verification', 'trigonometry']"
1472528,Why is the Fourier transform self-inverse?,"I've seen the standard proof that the Fourier transform is self-inverse (up to an overall factor determined by conventions), which is essentially equivalent to 
$\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{2 \pi i \omega x} dx = \delta(\omega)$.
That isn't too hard to see from definitions. But intuitively, the Fourier transform of a function gives the amplitude of each component frequency in an obvious sense.  Is it intuitively obvious that this operation is self-inverse or is there a deep reason why it must be so?","['fourier-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"
