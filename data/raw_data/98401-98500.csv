1359636,"Inverse image of $[-2,2]$ under cosine.","I solved the following problem: Let $g(z) = \cos z$.  Find $g^{-1}[-2,2]$. but my solution was kind of long.  I was wondering if there was a faster way to do this problem. Here's my solution: Write $\cos z = \frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2}$, and $z = a+bi$, so $$\cos z = \frac{e^{-b + ia} + e^{b - ia}}{2} = \frac{e^{-b}}{2}[\cos a + i \sin a] + \frac{e^b}{2}[\cos a - i \sin a]$$ $$ = \frac{e^{-b} + e^b}{2} \cos a + i \frac{e^{-b} - e^b}{2} \sin a$$ We first of all want $\cos z$ to be real, so either (i) $e^{-b} - e^b = 0$ or (ii) $\sin a = 0$.  The first case is not interesting, this just says that $b = 0$, and we already know in this case that $\cos a \in [-1,1]$.  For the second case, we will have $a = k \pi$ for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.  This implies that $$\cos z = \pm \frac{e^{-b} + e^{b}}{2}$$ so to make $\cos z \in [-2,2]$ we need $h(b) := e^{-b} + e^b$ to be in $[-4,4]$.  Clearly $h$ is an even function, increasing in either direction, so we need to solve $e^{-x} + e^x = 4$ for $x$.  Let $y = e^x$, then $\frac{1}{y} + y =4$, so $y^2 - 4y + 1 =0$.  Then $$y= \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = 2 \pm \sqrt{3}$$ so $x = \log (2 \pm \sqrt{3})$.  Looking at the equation we were supposed to solve, we know without calculating anything that $- \log(2 + \sqrt{3}) = \log(2 - \sqrt{3})$.  Letting $\alpha = \log(2 + \sqrt{3})$, it holds that $e^b + e^{-b} \leq 4$ for $- \alpha \leq b \leq \alpha$. Thus $g^{-1}[-2,2]$ consists of the real line unioned together with $$\bigcup\limits_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} \{ k \pi + bi : -\alpha \leq b \leq \alpha\}$$","['complex-analysis', 'complex-numbers']"

1359698,dimension formula for fiber product of affine varieties,"Let $X \subset \mathbb{A}^n, \,  Y \subset \mathbb{A}^m, \,  Z \subset \mathbb{A}^{\ell}$ be irreducible affine varieties and let $f: X \rightarrow Z, \, g: Y \rightarrow Z$ be surjective morphisms. Problem: Show that $\dim X \times_Z Y = \dim X + \dim Y - \dim Z$, where 
  $X \times_Z Y$ is the fiber product $\left\{(a,b)\in X\times Y: \, f(a)=g(b)\right\}$. My proof when $Z=\mathbb{A}^d$: The map $f$ is given by a $d$-tuple $(f_1,\dots,f_d)$ of elements of $A(X)$ and similarly $g=(g_1,\dots,g_d)$, where $g_i \in A(Y)$. 
Since $f$ is surjective, we have an injective ring homomorphism $A(Z)=k[z_1,\dots,z_d] \hookrightarrow A(X)$, given by $z_i \mapsto f_i$. Thus we can write $A(X)=k[f_1,\dots,f_d,x_1,\dots,x_s]$, where $f_1,\dots,f_d$ are algebraically independent over $k$. Similarly, we can write $A(Y)=k[g_1,\dots,g_d,y_1,\dots,y_t]$, where $g_1,\dots,g_d$ are algebraically independent over $k$. Now $A(X) \otimes_k A(Y) = k[f_1,\dots,f_d,g_1,\dots,g_d,x_1,\dots,x_s,y_1,\dots,y_t]$, with $f_1,\dots,f_d,g_1,\dots,g_d$ algebraically independent over $k$. Then 
\begin{align}
A(X \times_Z Y) &= k[f_1,\dots,f_d,g_1,\dots,g_d,x_1,\dots,x_s,y_1,\dots,y_t]/(f_1-g_1,\dots,f_d-g_d)\\&=k[f_1,\dots,f_d,x_1,\dots,x_s,y_1,\dots,y_t] = A(X) \otimes_{k} \left(A(Y)/(g_1,\dots,g_d)\right)
\end{align} and the dimension of this last ring is $\dim X+ (\dim Y - \dim Z)$. Question 1: Any comments on the proof above? Issue with the general case: When $Z \subset \mathbb{A}^\ell$ is any $d$-dimensional affine variety, we can write $f=(f_1,\dots,f_d,\dots,f_\ell)$, where $f_i \in A(X)$, $f_1,\dots,f_d$ are algebraically independent over $k$ and $f_{d+1},\dots,f_\ell$ are integral over $k[f_1,\dots,f_d]$. Similarly for $g=(g_1,\dots,g_d,\dots,g_\ell)$.
Now, to obtain $A(X \times_Z Y)$ we have to take the quotient of $A(X \times Y)$ by all $f_i-g_i$. This gives 
\begin{align}
A(X \times_Z Y) = k[f_1,\dots,f_d,x_1,\dots,x_s,y_1,\dots,y_t] / (f_{d+1}-g_{d+1},\dots,f_\ell - g_\ell).
\end{align} The challenge now is to show that 
\begin{align}
\dim k[f_1,\dots,f_d,x_1,\dots,x_s,y_1,\dots,y_t] = \dim \frac{k[f_1,\dots,f_d,x_1,\dots,x_s,y_1,\dots,y_t]} {(f_{d+1}-g_{d+1},\dots,f_\ell - g_\ell)}\end{align} All i know about the
$f_{d+1}-g_{d+1},\dots,f_\ell - g_\ell$ is that they are integral over 
$k[f_1,\dots,f_d,g_1,\dots,g_d]$ but this seems insufficient to show that the dimension remains unchanged. Question 2: Can the algebraic argument above be adjusted to yield a proof? Question 3: Is there any other, possibly more geometric, proof of the statement?","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"
1359701,Conditional probability as a primitive concept,"Most of the popular axiomatizations/theories of probability define conditional probability as a ratio involving unconditional probability.
Therefore, conditional probability is second class to unconditional one in such axiomatizations, and I suspect may suffer from some irregularities because of that.

1359720,The length of an quarter outer circle given an inner quarter circle of known length unknown radius.,"This question was asked by someone on reddit.  He wants to know the length, $K$, that a beam must be to surround a quarter circle segment of length $L$ at a distance $d$. This is his drawing. https://i.sstatic.net/9dLlq.jpg In the drawing the length of the inner quarter circle is $L$ and $d$ is the distance between the inner and outer quarter circle. The formula I derived is $$K= \frac{\pi d}{2} + L$$ But I'm not sure. I have a tendency to make trivial mistakes. I also think there might be an easier or more elegant way to derive this. I calculated the radius of the inner circle using $C/2r = \pi$ with $C=4L$ and  $L=\frac{(r\pi)}{2}$ so $r=\frac{2L}{\pi}$. Then I added $d$ to that to get the radius of the outer circle $R=r+d$ and used $\frac{C}{2R}=\pi$ with $C=4K$ and $K=\frac{R\pi}{2}$ to calculate $K$. This is my calculation: Assuming that the curved part is a quarter circle then from $\frac{C}{D} = \frac{C}{2r}= \pi$ and dividing by $4$ because you are dealing with a quarter circle and taking the length of the curved part equal to $L (C=4L)$ Then $$\frac{L}{r} = \frac{\pi}{2}$$ and solve for $r$ to get the radius of the inner circle. $$\frac{1}{r} = \frac{\pi}{2L}$$ $r=\frac{2L}{\pi}$ Then $r+d=R$ where $R$ is the radius of the outer circle Then reapply the formula $\frac{L}{r} = \frac{\pi}{2}$ for the outer curved part with unknown length $K$. (So replace $L$ with $K$ and $r$ with $R=r+d= \frac{2L}{\pi} + d$) $$\frac{K}{R}= \frac{\pi}{2}$$ where $R= d+r = d+\frac{2L}{\pi}$ Solve for $K$. $$K=\frac{R\pi}{2} =\left(d+\frac{2L}{\pi}\right)\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=\left(\frac{d\pi}{2}\right) +L$$ $$=\frac{d\pi}{2} + L$$","['geometry', 'algebra-precalculus']"
1359730,When are we permitted to multiply or divide both sides of an equation by a variable?,"As it is said in the mathematics books (at least the one I have), we are not permitted to divide or multiply both sides of an equation by a variable, because it is possible to lose some answers. For example, in the following equation $$x^2=x$$ if we divide both sides by $x$, we would have $x = 1$, but the original equation has two answers, $0$ and $1$, and we've lost $x = 0$ by dividing it by a variable. But in the same book, in order to solve a rational equation, the author multiplies both sides of the equation by $x(x-2)$, solving the equation: $$\begin{align*}
\frac {x+2}{x-2} - \frac1x &= \frac{2}{x(x-2)}\\\\
x(x-2)\frac {x+2}{x-2} - x(x-2)\frac 1x &= x(x-2)\frac{2}{x(x-2)}\\\\

1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}^x \equiv
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1

If you haven't looked at the linked answer, my question relates to the Fibonacci sequence in the following way:  If there exists an integer $n$ and an integer $x$ that satisfy the equation above, then the fibonacci sequence $ \pmod n$ repeats every $x$ terms.  That is,  $F_{i}\equiv F_{i+x}\pmod n$ To reiterate, can we characterize those integers $n$ for which there exists an associated integer $x$ that satisfies the matrix equation above? For $n=5$ we have the $x$ value of 20. For $n=6$ we have the $x$ value of 24. I am very interested to know if there are infinitely many solutions like this, or perhaps there is some largest $n$?  (I doubt the latter)  I am also interested to know what sorts of techniques can be used to solve the above matrix equation.

I didn't understand why $|AB:A|=|B:A\cap B|$. It is obvious if $AB$ is finite because using the Second Isomorphism theorem we have $|AB:B|=|A:A\cap B|$ because $AB/ B \cong A/ A\cap B$. Then

1359923,"Numerical methods (for ODE/PDE) that could take approximate solutions/good initial guesses, and further refine it to an certain accuracy","I am currently playing with an old analog computer, which could solve time-dependent ODE/PDEs pretty fast, without time-stepping; thus there is no convergence issues caused by time-stepping because of its computing nature. But the problem with analog computer's solutions is that they are not accurate due to physical limitations. I am very curious that: is there any numerical methods/solvers which can take analog computer's approximate solution (over the time domain) to further process it, and generate a more accurate solution??

$$
x'' = -0.2\cdot x' - 0.4\cdot x;\quad x(0)=1, x'(0) =0;\quad t_{stop} = 60s.
$$
To solve the above equation on an analog computer, we need to map the above equation to an electrical system. Usually an analog computer could perform several basic arithmetic operation in the continuous-time domain, e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication, integration etc. The output of an integrator represent an state-variable of the ODE; the input of that integrator represent the corresponding first-order time derivative. By configuring the basic computing blocks in feedback loops, we could map the equation as the following: (I use Simulink) After you load the initial conditions onto the integrators, you can let the analog computer run and solve. If you measure the electrical signal at the output of integrator1, you will get the solution of $x(t)$ over the time domain: But, due to the physical limitations (e.g. electrical noise, offsets), the solution of $x(t)$ is not accurate. What I am looking for is a numerical method that can take the above solution of $x(t)$ by analog computer, e.g. the solutions $x(t=1s), x(t=2s), x(t=3s), x(t=4s)... x(t=60s)$, start from these approximate solution points and further refine these solution $x(t=1s), ... x(t=60s)$ to a much higher accuracy.

There is another random variable $\mu$ where $\mu=\mu^G$ when $X_1=X^A_1+X^B_1 < X_2=X^A_2+X^B_2$ and $\mu=\mu^B$ otherwise. In this setup, I'd like to calculate $E[e^{-rX_1}\mu]$.

1360019,"Prob. 4, Sec. 28, in Munkres' TOPOLOGY, 2nd ed: For $T_1$-spaces countable compactness is equivalent to limit-point-compactness.","Definition (Countable Compactness): A topological space $X$ is said to be countably compact if every countable open covering of $X$ has a finite subcollection that also covers $X$ . Definition (Limit-Point Compactness): A topological space $X$ is said to be limit-point-compact if every infinite subset of $X$ has a limit point in $X$ . Then how to prove the following result? Let $X$ be a $T_1$ -space. Then $X$ is countably compact if and only if $X$ is limit point compact. My effort: Suppose $X$ is countably compact. If $X$ is not limit point compact, then let $A$ be an infinite subset of $X$ such that $A$ has no limit point in $X$ . Let $$ B \colon= \left\{ b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots \right\} $$ be a countably infinite subset of $A$ . Since we have assumed that $A$ has no limit point in $X$ and since $B \subset A$ , therefore $B$ has no limit point in $X$ either. So, the set $B^\prime$ of all the limit points of $B$ in $X$ is empty and thus contained in $B$ ; hence $B$ is closed in $X$ . Since $B$ has no limit points in $X$ and since $B \subset X$ , none of the elements of the set $B$ itself is a limit point of $B$ ; so for each element $b_n \in B$ , there is an open set $U_n$ in $X$ such that $$ U_n \cap B = \left\{b_n \right\} \tag{1} .$$ Now the collection $$ \left\{ \ U_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} \bigcup \{ X-B \} $$ forms a countable open covering of the countably compact space $X$ , so some finite subcollection of this covering also covers $X$ and hence that finite subcollection also covers $B$ . But the set $X-B$ contains no point of $B$ . So $B$ is covered by finitely many of the sets $$ \left\{ \ U_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}, $$ each of which contains exactly one point of set $B$ [Refer to (1) above.]. This implies that set $B$ is a finite set, contrary to our choice of $B$ . Hence $X$ is limit point compact. Is this proof correct? How to prove the converse? PS: From the above proof (where we haven't required $X$ to be a T $_1$ -space), we can even state the following: Every (countably) compact topological space $X$ is also limit point compact. Am I right? P.S.: Based on the answers below, I state and prove the following result: Let $X$ be a $T_1$ topological space. If $X$ is limit point compact, then $X$ is also countably compact. Proof: Suppose that $X$ is a limit point compact, $T_1$ topological space that is not countably compact. Then there is a countable open covering $\left\{ \ U_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}$ of $X$ that has no finite subcollection that also covers $X$ . Let us define the collection $\left\{ \ V_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}$ of sets as follows: $$ V_n \colon= \begin{cases} U_1 \ & \mbox{ if } \ n = 1, \\ V_{n-1} \cup U_n \ & \mbox{ if } \ n = 2, 3, 4, \ldots. \end{cases} $$ That is, $$
\begin{align}
 V_1 & \colon= U_1, \\
 V_2 & \colon= U_1 \cup U_2, \\
 V_3 & \colon= U_1 \cup U_2 \cup U_3, \\
 V_4 & \colon= U_1 \cup U_2 \cup U_3 \cup U_4, \\
     & \cdots \\
\end{align}
$$ We note that $$ V_1 \subset V_2 \subset V_3 \subset \cdots. \tag{1} $$ For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , as $U_n \subset V_n \subset X $ and as $$ \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty U_n = X, \tag{2} $$ so we must also have $$ \bigcup_{n = 1}^\infty V_n = X. \tag{2*} $$ Thus $\left\{ \ V_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}$ is also a countable open covering of $X$ . Now as $V_1 = U_1$ is a proper subset of $X$ [Refer to the first paragraph of this proof.], so there exists a point $x_1 \in X \setminus V_1$ . In fact, the set $X \setminus V_1$ is an infinite set, becuase if this set were finite, then  the open covering $\left\{ \ U_n \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}$ of $X$ would have a finite subcollection also covering $X$ . Suppose that $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n > 1$ , and suppose that the $n-1$ distinct points $x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1} \in X$ have been chosen. Using the same reasoning as in the paragraph preceding the last one, the set $V_n = U_1 \cup \cdots \cup U_n$ is a proper subset of $X$ [Refer to the first paragraph of this proof again.] and as  the set $X \setminus V_n$ is an infinite set; so there exists a point $x_n \in X \setminus V_n$ such that $x_n \neq x_j$ for any $j = 1, \ldots, n-1$ . In this way we obtain the infinite subset $S$ of $X$ given by $$ S \colon= \left\{ \ x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots \ \right\}. \tag{3} $$ Furthermore we note that, for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , as $x_n \not\in V_n$ , and as $V_n \supset V_j$ for each $j = 1, \ldots, n$ , by virtue of (1) above, so we can also conclude, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , the following: $$ x_n \not\in V_j  \mbox{ for any } j = 1 \ldots n. \tag{4} $$ Since $X$ is limit point compact, the infinite set $S$ of $X$ as defined in (3) above in the paragraph prior to the preceding paragraph has a limit point $p$ in $X$ . Now using (2*) above, as $$ p \in X = \bigcup_{n = 1}^ \infty V_n, $$ so there exists a natural number $r$ such that $p \in V_r$ ; let $r$ be the smallest such natural number. Now as $p$ is a limit point in $X$ of set $S$ and as $V_r$ is an open set of $X$ containing $p$ , so $$ V_r \cap \big( S \setminus \{ p \} \big) \neq \emptyset, $$ that is, there exists an element $x_k$ of $S \setminus \{ p \}$ such that $x_k \in V_r$ also. Thus we have $x_k \in V_r$ . But by (4) above as $x_k \not\in V_k$ , so $$ V_r \not\subset V_k, $$ and hence in view of (1) above we can conclude that $$ r \not\leq k, $$ which implies that $$ r > k , $$ that is [Note that $x_k \in S$ . Refer to (3) above.], $$ k \in \{ 1, \ldots, r-1 \}. $$ Therefore the open set $V_r$ containing the limit point $p$ of set $S$ can intersect $S$ in only finitely nany points. But since $X$ is a $T_1$ space, $V_r$ must intersect $S$ in infinitely many points, by Theorem 17.9 in Munkres. Thus we have a contradiction. Thus if a $T_1$ topological space $X$ is limit point compact, then $X$ is also countably compact. Is this proof correct and clear enough in its presentation? Or, are there any problems in it of accuracy, clarity, or detail?","['general-topology', 'compactness']"
1360044,Looking for a direct proof of the following exercise,"A friend of mine told me about the following problem: Let $\{r_n\}$ be a sequence of rational numbers such that $\lim_{n\to\infty}r_n=x\in\Bbb R,$ $r_n\neq x,$ for every $n\in\Bbb N$ and $r_n=\dfrac{a_n}{b_n},$ for each $n\in\Bbb N,$ where $\{a_n\}$ is a sequence of integers and $\{b_n\}$ is a sequence of positive integers. Prove that $\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n=+\infty.$ I proved such result by contradiction: If $\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n\neq+\infty,$ then $\exists M\in\Bbb R$ such that $\forall N\in\Bbb N,$ there exists some $n\geq N$ such that $b_n<M.$ Therefore, we can construct a subsequence $\{b_{m_k}\}$ of $\{b_n\}$ as follows: First $\exists m_0\geq0$ such that $b_{m_0}<M.$ Having chosen $m_1,\ldots,m_p,$ let $m_{p+1}$ be such that $m_{p+1}>m_p$ and $b_{m_{p+1}}<M.$ Since $1\leq b_{m_k}<M,$ for every $k\in\Bbb N$ and $\{b_n\}$ is a sequence of positive integers, there must exist some constant subsequence $\{b_{n_k}\}$ of $\{b_n\}.$ Let $b$ be the positive integer such that $b_{n_k}=b$ for every $k\in\Bbb N$ and let $\delta>0$ be arbitrary. Since $\{r_n\}$ converges to $x,$ then $\{r_{n_k}\}$ converges to $x$ and hence, there is some natural $N_0$ such that $$0<\left|\dfrac{a_{n_k}}{b}-x\right|<\dfrac{\delta}{b},$$ for each $k\geq N_0.$ Then $$0<\left|a_{n_k}-bx\right|<\delta,$$ for every $k\geq N_0.$ Since $\delta$ is arbitrary, this means that $\lim_{k\to\infty}a_{n_k}=bx.$ Therefore $\exists N_1\in\Bbb N$ and $\exists a\in\Bbb Z$ such that $a_{n_k}=a,$ for every $k\geq N_1.$ Therefore, $r_{n_k}=\dfrac{a}{b},$ for sufficiently large $k,$ which contradicts the fact that $r_n\neq x,$ for every $n\in\Bbb N.$ My questions are , is there a direct proof of the exercise? or is there an elegant solution? and, is the idea of my proof correct?","['sequences-and-series', 'alternative-proof', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

$$
\left\{ \omega: \lim_{n \to\infty} X_n(\omega) = X(\omega) \right\} = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \lim_{n \to\infty} \left\{ \omega: |X_m(\omega)-X(\omega)| < \epsilon, \mbox{for all } m \geq n \right\}. (***)

We define the upper integral $\int^* f d\mu$ as follows. $\int^* f d\mu = \text{inf }\{\int g d\mu: f \le g, g:\text{ measurable}\}$. It seems to me that the following proposition is correct. Let $f_1\le f_2 \le \cdots$ be a non-decreasing sequence of functions $X\rightarrow [0, \infty]$.
  Let $f(x) = \text{lim}_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n(x)$ for all $x\in X$.
  Then $\int^* f d\mu = \text{lim}_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int^* f_n d\mu$. How do you prove this if it is correct? Actually I think I have a proof of it, but I am not 100% sure that it is correct. I think it would be nice that someone confirms that I am on the right track.",['measure-theory']

1360428,$|\mathbb N^{\mathbb N}| = |2^\mathbb N|$ by finding a bijection,"I was trying to find a direct proof that $|\mathbb N^{\mathbb N}| = |2^\mathbb N|$, by finding a bijection between the two sets. The idea that came to mind was to start with the sequence of natural numbers. Each natural number would be 'translated' in a sequence of zeroes of the length given by the natural number. A  1 would be added to the sequence obtained, and all the 01 sequences thus obtained would be concatenated in the order dictated by the original sequence of naturals. However, this would run into problems, since all complete 01 sequences thus obtained would end on 1, so that the function from $\mathbb N^{\mathbb N}$ to $2^\mathbb N$ would not be surjective. I turned to Stack Exchange for advice and found out that the post Cardinality of the set of all natural sequences is $2^{\aleph_0}$ contained the same solution, except that ones were switched for zeroes and vice versa. Of course, this could not work either: all 01 sequences obtained end on 0. As a workaround to the problem, I would propose the function as described above, except that the last natural number in the original series would now be translated in its binary form, and no 0 or 1 added. I think that would result in a bijection. Could that be right? Would there be other possibilities? Edit: I am now convinced that the approach I proposed cannot work either. The function is not injective. At first I thought that the last part of the 01 sequence corresponding to the last natural number of the original sequence would be identifiable by its starting with 11 (one 1 stemming from the previous number, the other from the binary form of the last natural in the sequence - except when that would be 0). I now realize that 11 may occur within the binary form itself.

1360475,Bivariate infinite series: explicit sum?,"Let $S_n(x,y)=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}\frac{x^k}{k!}y^{n-k}$, and consider the series $S(x,y)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty S_n(x,y)$, where $x,y\in \mathbb{R}$.  My question is: does this series have an explicit sum (i.e. closed-form expression)? The main reason why such a sum may exist is that if the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ were set equal to unity in $S_n$, then the series becomes $S(x,y)=\frac{\exp x}{1-y}$ by the Cauchy product.  It is possible that we have a ""simple"" modification of this function that produces the binomial coefficients in $S_n$.  This seems plausible, since it can be shown that $S$ is absolutely convergent for all $x$ and for $y\in(-1,1)$, which mimics the properties of $\frac{\exp x}{1-y}$.","['sequences-and-series', 'multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"

\begin{eqnarray}\frac{p_{0}(y)}{(2m)!}x^{2m}+\frac{p_{1}(y)}{(2m-2)!}x^{2m-2}+\cdots+\frac{p_{m-1}(y)}{2!}x^2+p_{m}(y)\end{eqnarray}
and $Q_{2m+1}$
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{p_{0}(y)}{(2m+1)!}x^{2m+1}+\frac{p_{1}(y)}{(2m-1)!}x^{2m-1}+\cdots+\frac{p_{m-1}(y)}{6}x^3+p_{m}(y)x
\end{eqnarray} $Q_k(k+1-2i, k+1)$ as a polynomial in $i$ has roots $1, 2, \cdots, k$. Find a general formula of $Q_k(x, y)$. The following are the first 4 polynomials in the sequence:
\begin{align*}
Q_1&=x\\
Q_2&=\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{y}{6}\\
Q_3&=\frac{x^3-xy}{6}\\
Q_4&=\frac{x^4-2x^2y}{24}+\frac{y(5y+2)}{360}
\end{align*} In fact, it suffices to find the sequence of polynomials $p_j(y)$. Here's what I've got so far. By condition (2) and (3), we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{j=0}^m \frac{p_j(2m+1)}{(2m-2j)!}(2i-2m-1)^{2m-2j}=\frac{2^{2m}}{(2m)!}(i-1)(i-2)\cdots(i-2m)
\end{eqnarray}
If we let $m=j+k$, differentiate both sides with respect to $i$ $2k$ times and put $\displaystyle i=\frac{2j+2k+1}{2}$, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
p_j(2j+2k+1)=\left.\frac{d^{2k}}{di^{2k}}\right|_{i=\frac{2j+2k+1}{2}}\frac{2^{2j}}{(2(j+k))!}(i-1)(i-2)\cdots(i-2(j+k))
\end{eqnarray}
Letting $k=0, 1, \cdots, j$, we get the $j+1$ values taken by $p_j$ at $2j+1, 2j+3, \cdots, 4j+1$. $p_j$ then can be computed using Lagrangian interpolation. It seems to me that, though the above algorithm can be implemented on a computer to get a few polynomials in the sequence, it does not yield directly a general formula I want. Is there another better way to go about getting a general formula? Edit: The first 6 members in the polynomial sequence $p_j(y)$ are the following:
\begin{align*}
p_0(y)&=1\\
p_1(y)&=-\frac{y}{6}\\
p_2(y)&=\frac{y(5y+2)}{360}\\
p_3(y)&=-\frac{y(35y^2+42y+16)}{45360}\\

Assume that $T\in M_{5\times 5}(\mathbb{Q})$, with $|T|=8$, and let $f(x)=x^8-1$. Since $f(T) = 0$, it follows that, if $m(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $T$, then we must have $m(x)$ dividing $f(x)=x^8-1=(x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1)(x^4+1)$. Since $T\in M_{5\times 5}(\mathbb{Q})$, we must also have $\deg(m)\leq 5$, and so $m(x)=(x-1)^{e_1}(x+1)^{e_2}(x^2+1)^{e_3}(x^4+1)^{e_4}$, with each $e_i \in \{0,1\}$. If $e_4 = 0$, then $|T|\leq 4$; so $x^4 + 1$ must divide $m(x)$. As the largest of $T$'s invariant factors, $m(x)$ must be divisible by any smaller invariant factors; however, $x^4+1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. And so, recalling our constraint on the degree of $m$, we must have $m(x) = (x-1)^{e_1}(x+1)^{e_2}(x^4+1)$, where $e_1+e_2 =1$. (By the way, $m(x)=p(x)$, the characteristic polynomial of $T$.) At this point, my first time through the problem, I still thought I was proving the statement and wanted to show a contradiction.

$$
 A_k := \{ B_n > k \mbox{ for infinitely many }n \}

and $A := \bigcap_k A_k$, then $\omega \in A$ iff the path of $\omega$ is unbounded, i.e. $A = \{\limsup_n B_n = +\infty\}$. Each set $A_k$ is in the tail-$\sigma$-algebra as the limsup of sets, and so $A$ as a countable intersection is a tail-event, therefore by Kolmogoroff's 0-1-law we have $P(A) \in \{0,1\}$. As for each $n$ we have
$$ 
 P(B_n > \sqrt n) = 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{\sqrt n}{\sqrt n}\right) > 0.1

$$ 
 \bigcup_n \{ B_n > \sqrt n \} \subseteq A

we could not have $P(A) = 0$, therefore $P(A) = 1$. Similarly the case $P(\liminf_n B_n = -\infty) = 1$ might be establised.

for every $m \in \mathbb{Z}_N$ and every primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ modulo $N$. Prove or disprove that each $a_k = 0$ for every $k \in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^\times$. Thanks!","['fourier-analysis', 'number-theory', 'analytic-number-theory', 'characters', 'convolution']"
