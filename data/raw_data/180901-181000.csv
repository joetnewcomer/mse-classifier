3294841,Probability distribution of the distance after $n$ random jumps in a plane,"I want to know if there is an analytical way to approximate the distribution of a random variable defined by $$Y_n:=\left|\sum_{k=1}^n e^{i X_k}\right|$$ where the $X_k\sim U[-\pi,\pi]$ are i.i.d. I did some computer simulations, however Im trying to see if there is some analytic machinery to, at least, approximate the distribution of $Y_n$ . I know how to write analytically $E[Y_n]$ for $n$ (indeed I have the estimate $E[Y_n]\le\sqrt n$ , via Jensen's inequality because $E[Y_n^2]=n$ ), and I could write explicitly $F_{Y_2}$ , however for $n>2$ I dont know how to proceed (or how to approximate). Also I know how to explicitly write the iterated integrals for the computation of the distribution of $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{i X_k}$ , however I dont know any approach to compute the distribution of it absolute value. Some help will be appreciated or, if someone knows, some paper or book where to dig about similar questions. EDIT: also note that $Y_n=|Y_{n-1}+e^{i X_n}|$ , so it seems possible to approximate the distribution of $Y_n$ using some kind of recursion. Also it is easy to check that $$Y_n=\sqrt{n+2\sum_{1\le j< k\le n}\cos(X_j-X_k)}$$ However this last expression at first glance doesn't seems useful for an analytic (approximation) to it distribution. EDIT 2: adding some histograms that approximate the densities For $n\le 5$ the estimated densities are strange (not of bell form), however for $n=2$ the density approaches the theoretical density, that is $$f_{Y_2}(x)=\frac1{\pi\sqrt{1-(x/2)^2}}\chi_{[0,2]}(x)$$ (Note the vertical asymptote at $x=2$ in $f_{Y_2}$ . Anyway the empirical approximation tends to it). If someone is interested this was the code, written in Julia, that I had used for the simulations: # Sum of random jumps in the plane
function rsum(n::Int)
    p = 1.0
    for j in 2:n
        p += exp(2pi * im * rand())
    end
    return p
end

# Distance after n random jumps
function rd(n::Int)
    abs(rsum(n))
end

 # Data array to build an histogram
 function sim(n::Int, m::Int = 22)
    datos = zeros(2^m)
    for i in 1:2^m
        datos[i] = rd(n)
    end
    return datos

\nabla^i(\varphi\psi)\nabla_i(\varphi\psi) = \varphi^2 \nabla^i\psi\nabla_i\psi + \psi^2\nabla^i\varphi\nabla_i\varphi + \varphi\psi(\nabla^i\varphi\nabla_i\psi + \nabla^i\psi\nabla_i\varphi).

3295061,"Let $p,q > 2$ be distinct primes. Show that $\mathbb{Z}_{pq}^*$ is not cyclic.","I recognize this question has been asked many times before ( here , here , and here ) and in other forms (that $pq$ does not have a primitive root for example). I am also self-studying Aluffi's Algebra and am wondering specifically about the last solution above I have linked. We know that $\mathbb{Z}_{pq}^*$ has order $pq$ less the multiples of $p$ or $q$ between $1$ and $pq$ . These multiples of $p$ are $p,2p,...,(q-1)p$ , of $q$ are $q,2q,...,(p-1)q$ , and of course their least common multiple $pq$ . So the order is $pq - (p-1) - (q-1) - 1 = (p-1)(q-1)$ . We aim to show that there is no element of this order so that the group cannot be cyclic. Put $n = (p-1)(q-1) /2$ . Both factors in the numerator are even so we can do this and still have both factors dividing $n$ . The last solution linked above uses that for $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{pq}^{*}$ we have $m$ in both $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{*}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{q}^{*}$ , with $$ m^{n} \equiv m^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p  \\
m^{n} \equiv m^{q-1} \equiv 1 \mod q.$$ From which we get $p,q | m^{n} - 1$ so $pq | (m^{n}-1)$ since $p,q$ are coprime. But how do we know that $$ m^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p  \\
m^{q-1} \equiv 1 \mod q$$ without something like Lagrange's theorem? Aluffi doesn't develop a lot for us to work with...","['elementary-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

I've found (in Steen & Seebach's ""Counterexamples"") some examples of spaces which have $\sigma$ -locally finite bases but are not second-countable. Problem is, they all have an explicit metric... In fact, most of them are only described as metric spaces, with no metric-independent description of the topology. So these examples are not very motivating... I know there are theoretical implications of NG thm that provides motivation, but right now I'm looking specifically for a down-to-earth, tangible example, preferably one that the average undergrad can cope with. Edit: here is the formulation of the thms: Urysohn: A $T_{3}$ , second-countable space (i.e. $X$ has a countable base for its topology) is metrizable. Nagata-Smirnov: A topological space is metrizable iff it's $T_{3}$ and has a base for its topology that is a countable union of locally finite families. (where a family $A_i, i \in I$ of subsets of $X$ is locally finite in $X$ iff every $x \in X$ has a neighbourhood $O_x$ such that $\{i \in I: O_x \cap A_i \neq \emptyset\}$ is finite.)","['metrizability', 'general-topology']"

My attempt: $$\left[ 2 \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2n} \right) \right]^n = \left( e^{i \frac{\pi}{2n}} + e^{-i \frac{\pi}{2n}} \right)^n = \left( i^{\frac{1}{n}} + \frac{1}{i^{\frac{1}{n}}} \right)^n = \left( \frac{i^{\frac{2}{n}} + 1}{i^{\frac{1}{n}}} \right)^n$$ But I am stuck here and I am no more sure that this is a real quantity.

3295662,In how many way can 4 men and 3 women be arranged if 3 men always sit together?,"If it were the three women that had to sit together i could solve this as by putting them in a single group among the men. If i multiply the permutation of these groups by the permutation of women inside this group i would get a total of 5! * 3!  = 720. I thought of using this strategy for the problem of arranging the men and multiplying by C(4,3)=4 because the group is a combination of 3 out of 4 men, which would give 4 * 720 = 2880. From creating a list of all permutations, labelling them man/women and searching for three adjacent men i know however that the answer must be 2304. That means my approach above is double counting some of them. For example when i would number the men and women these two permutations with the constructed group between brackets, would be equal: (M1, M2, M3), M4, W1,W2, W3 M1, (M2, M3, M4), W1,W2, W3 Also from the result of 2304 i would suspect it to contain factors like 3! * 4! * 4 * 4 = 2304, but can't put it together.

[duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Probability, conditional on a zero probability event (3 answers) Closed 4 years ago . Yeah, like in the title, how do Regular Conditional Probabilities assign values to $P(A|B)$ when $P(B) = 0$ ? Because I am not trained in advanced probability, please explain it as simply as possible. It'll be great if you can demonstrate with an example. Let $X$ be a random variable between $[0, 1]$ . What is the $P(X=\frac{2}{3}|X=\frac{2}{3})$ ? Also, can it also assign values to $P(A|B)$ in finite spaces? For example, imagine you throw a die, and you observe that the die landed on an odd number at 12 noon. So letting $O$ be the event that the die landed odd, $P(O)$ changes from $\frac{1}{2}$ to $1$ after noon. Hence, after noon, letting $E$ be the event that the die landed even, $P(E)$ changes to $0$ . But even after 12 noon, I still intuitively want to say that $P(E|E)$ is still $1$ . It seems to me that for any non-empty set $A$ in the sigma-algebra, $P(A|A) = 1$ . Can regular conditional probabilities assign $P(E|E)$ a value of $1$ ? Is it possible? Or do I need to give that intuition up? Thanks for your help. Edit: I think my question is different from this: Probability, conditional on a zero probability event Because I'm asking about finite spaces too. Also, I'm asking for a demonstration of how regular conditional probabilities assign value to $P(X=\frac{2}{3}|X=\frac{2}{3})$ . Edit 2: Let the sample space in the dice example be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Edit 3: The sample space for the dice example is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The initial probability function before noon is $P$ . After noon, the probability function becomes $P'$ . So $P(O)$ = $P(E)$ = 0.5. But $P'(O) = 1$ and $P'(E) = 0$ . Still, I want to say that $P'(E|E) = 1$ .","['conditional-probability', 'probability']"

Next, solve the system of equations for $x$ and $y$ , we end up with the coordinates of $E(\frac{15}{8},\frac{5}{2})$ . To solve the first question, we can use the distance between two points formula, therefore $AE=\sqrt{(3-\frac{15}{8})^2+(4-\frac{5}{2})^2}=\frac{15}{8}$ cm. Hence D is the correct choice. To solve the second question, we can use the area of triangle formula, area of $\triangle ABC=\frac{1}{2}\times 3\times 4=6$ cm $^2$ . area of $\triangle CDE=\frac{1}{2}\times 5\times \frac{5}{2}=6.25$ cm $^2$ . Hence B is the correct choice. In the exam, calculators are not allowed. It is simple to determine to coordinates of $E$ without a calculator, but it will take time! For the first question, I think there is a good way to solve, maybe $BD$ divides $AC$ into two parts ( $AE$ and $CE$ ) in a ratio, this ratio can be calculated somehow. For the second question, I think also a good way to think, like moving $D$ will make $\triangle CDE$ bigger or smaller, while $\triangle ABC$ will be unchanged. But this has a limitation since the areas $6$ and $6.25$ cm $^2$ are close, it will not be obvious to us.

Now by Fatou's lemma, we have \begin{align}
\int_0^1 f(x)dx&=\int_0^1\lim_{k_i\to\infty}f_{k_i}(x)dx\\
&\le\varliminf_{k_i\to\infty}\int_E f_{k_i}(x)dx+\varliminf_{k_i\to\infty}\int_{[0,1]\setminus E} f_{k_i}(x)dx\\
&\le\varliminf_{k_i\to\infty}\int_0^1 f_{k_i}(x)dx\\
&=\int_0^1 f(x)dx

Then we have \begin{align}
\sum\limits_{q=0}^2 (-1)^q\mathrm{Tr}(h^*, H^q_{et}(X, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})) \equiv \mathrm{deg}(\Gamma^*_h(\Delta))\mod n
\end{align} I have trouble interpreting what $\Gamma^*_h(\Delta)$ really is. I understand that it is meant to represent the intersection of the diagonal and the graph of $h$ in $X \times_k X$ , projected in $X$ , to represent the fixed points of $h$ . In particular, if $h$ has as only finitely many isolated fixed points $x_1,\ldots, x_r$ with multiplicity $m_1,\cdots,m_r$ , then $\Gamma^*_h(\Delta)$ should be the divisor on $X$ defined as $\sum_k m_k[x_k]$ . But I know that divisors don't pull back that easily, for instance is $h$ is simply the identity, I don't know what divisor $\Gamma_h^*(\Delta)$ on X could be. As I interpret it, $\Gamma^*_h$ is not in general a well defined divisor, but rather the image by $\Gamma^*_h : H^{2}(X \times_k X, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}) \to H^{2}(X, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ of the class of the divisor $\Delta$ seen in $Pic(X)/nPic(X) \cong H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ through the connection morphism $H^1(X, \mathcal{O}^*_{X_{et}}) \to H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ given by Kummer's theory and the short exact sequence \begin{align}
0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}^*_{X_{et}} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}^*_{X_{et}} \longrightarrow 0
\end{align} Then $\deg(\Gamma_h^*(\Delta)) \mod n$ makes sense as $\overline{deg}(\underbrace{\Gamma_h^*(\Delta)}_{\in H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})})$ where $\overline{deg} : \mathrm{Pic}(X)/n\mathrm{Pic}(X) \to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ arises from $\mathrm{deg} : \mathrm{Pic} \to \mathbb{Z}$ . This interpretation does not seems to change anything in the proof given by the author, except when he writes: \begin{align}
\mathrm{cl}(\Delta) = \mathrm{cl}(\mathcal{L}(\Delta)) = \mathrm{cl(\mathcal{L}(\Gamma^*_h(\Delta)))}
\end{align} Where $\mathrm{cl}$ is the class in $H^2(X \times_k X, \mathbb{Z}/n)$ or $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ (depending of the argument) of a cycle, and $\mathcal{L}(D)$ is an invertible $\mathcal{O}_X$ module associated to the divisor D. It is shown that in this case the image of its class in $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ is the same as $\mathrm{cl}(D)$ . The first equality remains true but the second makes no sense if $\Gamma_h^*(\Delta)$ is not a divisor. But since the trace of such an expression is then taken, and that the Trace $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}) \to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ , is defined as the composite $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathrm{Pic}(X)/n\mathrm{Pic}(X) \overset{\overline{\mathrm{deg}}}{\to} \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ , this does not seem to impact the proof. I still have two questions Is my interpretation correct? I think that as I said, this interpretation of $\Gamma_h^*(\Delta)$ does not change anything to the proof, but I am still a bit unsure. If it is correct, how does this interpretation translates back to the ""nice"" interpretation, in the case of a function with isolated fixed points $x_1,\cdots, x_r$ with multiplicities $m_1,\cdots,m_r$ , so that $\mathrm{deg}(\Gamma_h^*(\Delta)) = \sum_k m_k$ as expected?","['etale-cohomology', 'divisors-algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

3296182,Notions of continuity for stochastic processes,"I would like to receive some clarification regarding the difference between continuous in probability and continuous almost surely . Using the definition of the wikipedia page (that match the one I have seen in other references), we have Continuous in probability for all $\varepsilon>0$ \begin{equation}
\lim_{s\rightarrow t} \mathbb{P}\left(\left\{\omega \in \Omega : |X_s(\omega) - X_t(\omega) | \geq \varepsilon\right\} \right)= 0
\end{equation} and Continuous with probability 1 (almost surely) \begin{equation}
\mathbb{P}\left(\left\{\omega \in \Omega : \lim_{s\rightarrow t} |X_s(\omega) - X_t(\omega) | = 0 \right\} \right)= 1
\end{equation} Now, I can see that the second condition is stronger than the first one, but to me they seem analogous, since the first should be valid for arbitrarily close $\varepsilon$ . Obviously, my intuition is wrong, but I cannot understand how the difference can be significant. Could you please explain how the two definitions give raise to different processes?

Then in $\mathbb{R}^k$ we have $\text{closed} \land \text{bounded} \implies \text{compact}$ (Heine-Borel theorem), so by simple logic knowing it is not compact we have: $$\neg\text{compact} \implies \left( \neg\text{closed} \lor \neg\text{bounded} \right),$$ and since it is closed by definition, it must be unbounded.

The property $ A - g [B] \subseteq A_1 $ probably stems from the fact that if every  element in $A$ that is not in the range of $g$ is not inside of $ A_1 $ then we could end up having a blindspot in constructing $ h $ to be bijective since we're using $h(x)= f(x)$ for $ x\in A_1 $ I'm slightly confused about how to prove things when the big intersection $ \bigcap $ sign involved.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions', 'solution-verification']"

Solution: (1)If $x\ge3$ , then, among all solutions $(x,y,z)$ , select $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ which minimizes the sum $x_0+y_0+z_0$ . By Modulo 8, $$3^{y_0}\equiv5^{z_0}$$ Note that $3^{y_0}\equiv1\pmod8$ whenever $y_0$ is even, and $3^{y_0}\equiv3\pmod8$ whenever $y_0$ is odd.
Also, $5^{z_0}\equiv1\pmod8$ whenever $z_0$ is even, and $5^{z_0}\equiv5\pmod8$ whenever $z_0$ is odd. Therefore, both $y_0$ and $z_0$ must be even.

But we already know that $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is the smallest solution. This could only mean that $a\le2$ . Case I. $a=1$ . $$\begin{cases}5-3^b=2^m\\5+3^b=2^n\end{cases}$$ From this, $2^m+2^n=10$ . The only possible solution to this is $(m,n)=(1,3)$ Hence, $3^b=3\implies b=1$ .
This shows that $(m,b,a)=(1,1,1)\implies(x_0,y_0,z_0)=(4,2,2)$ . Case II. $a=2$ . $$\begin{cases}25-3^b=2^m\\25+3^b=2^n\end{cases}$$ From this, $2^m+2^n=50$ . There are no integer solutions for this equation. (2)If x=2 ,note that [1^{z}-(-1)^{y}\equiv 0(mod4)]and [(-1)^{^{z}}\equiv 1(mod3)].So z is even and y is is even.Let $z=2c$ and $y=2d$ .So $4=(5^c-3^d)(5^c+3^d)$ .But $(5^c-3^d)$ and $(5^c+3^d)$ is even ,There are no integer solutions for this equation.

You have $5^z \equiv 2 \pmod9$ , which implies $z\equiv 5 \pmod6$ .
Then you have $5^5-3^y \equiv 2 \pmod7$ ,which implies $y\equiv 0 \pmod6$ .
You have also $-3^y \equiv 2 \pmod5$ ,which implies $y\equiv 1 \pmod4$ .

However, I think it's very nice, because it highlights the properties of logarithms, including the $x \to 1/x$ antisymmetry, and again, converges fast. Due to the fact that it's alternating, we can also use a better approximation with the truncated sum: $$\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2} \left(\frac{\log x}{x-1}+\frac{x+1}{2x} \right)  \approx \\ \approx  \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \frac{(-1)^n}{1-4 n^2} \binom{2n}{n} \frac{\left(x+ \frac{1}{x}-2 \right)^n}{2^{4n}}+\frac{(-1)^N}{2(1-4 N^2)} \binom{2N}{N} \frac{\left(x+ \frac{1}{x}-2 \right)^N}{2^{4N}}$$ What's really interesting (to me at least) is how I obtained this series. I didn't even think about hyperbolic functions. I started with a Frullani integral: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{t} \left(\frac{1}{1+t}-\frac{1}{1+xt} \right)= \log x$$ Then I used the inverse function identity: $$y= f(t)=\frac{1}{t} \left(\frac{1}{1+t}-\frac{1}{1+xt} \right)$$ $$\log x= \int_{y(\infty)}^{y(0)} f^{-1} (y) dy$$ We can get the inverse function explicitly: $$y t (1+t) (1+x t)=(x-1) t$$ $$t^2+\frac{x+1}{x} t+\frac{y-x+1}{x y}=0$$ Solving this simple quadratic and taking the positive root, we obtain: $$t(y)=\frac{1}{2x} \left( \sqrt{\frac{x-1}{y}} \sqrt{(x-1) y+4x}-(x+1) \right)$$ $$\log x= \int_0^{x-1} t(y) dy$$ Substituting: $$y=(x-1) z^2$$ We have: $$t(z)=\frac{1}{2x} \left( \frac{1}{z} \sqrt{(x-1)^2 z^2+4x}-(x+1) \right)$$ $$\log x=\frac{x-1}{x} \int_0^1 \left( \sqrt{(x-1)^2 z^2+4x}-(x+1)z \right) dz$$ Simple rearrangement and expanding the square root immediately leads to (1), including the condition for convergence. I wonder if other, even more interesting series for the logarithm can be obtained by this method, using the general integral: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{F(t)-F(x t)}{t} dt=(F(0)-F(\infty)) \log x$$ * Update, more information about convergence rate: If we denote: $$f(x)=\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2} \left(\frac{\log x}{x-1}+\frac{x+1}{2x} \right)$$ $$S(x)=\sum_{n=0}^N \frac{(-1)^n}{1-4 n^2} \binom{2n}{n} \frac{\left(x+ \frac{1}{x}-2 \right)^n}{2^{4n}}$$ $$G(x)=\sqrt{x} \left(\frac{1}{x-1} \sum_{k=0}^N \frac{1}{2k+1}\left(\frac{x-1}{x+1}\right)^{2k+1}+\frac{x+1}{4x} \right) $$ Then it's clear that for a very small number of terms $N \leq 10$ and for $x$ close to $1$ , $S(x)$ performs better than $G(x)$ , but for larger number of terms it's not as good. There's another series I found for the logarithm, but it has even slower convergence: $$\log x= \frac{x^2-1}{2x} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1) \binom{2n}{n}} \frac{(x-1)^{2n}}{x^n}$$","['integration', 'logarithms', 'sequences-and-series']"

3296695,Can I get disjoint cycles decomposition of $\sigma \in S_n$ from the partition of $I_n$ into orbits under the action of $\langle \sigma \rangle$?,"I'm aware of this similar post, whose answer, though, is too ""implicit"" for my understanding. Then, I reformulate as follows. Given a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ , let's consider the cyclic subgroup generated by $\sigma$ , $\langle \sigma \rangle = \lbrace \sigma^k, k=1,\dots,o(\sigma) \rbrace \le S_n$ , and its action on the set $I_n=\lbrace 1,\dots,n \rbrace$ . The orbit by $j \in I_n$ induced by this action is given by the collection $O_\sigma(j)=\lbrace \sigma^k(j), k=1,\dots,o(\sigma) \rbrace \subseteq I_n$ . By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the size of the orbit -namely the cardinality of the set $O_\sigma(j)$ - is given by: $$|O_\sigma(j)|=\frac{o(\sigma)}{|\mathcal{Fix}_\sigma(j)|}=[\langle\sigma\rangle:\mathcal{Fix}_\sigma(j)] \tag 1$$ where $\mathcal{Fix_\sigma(j)}:=\lbrace \sigma^k \in \langle\sigma\rangle \mid \sigma^k(j)=j \rbrace \le \langle \sigma \rangle$ . Furthermore, the number of the orbits is given by: $$|\mathcal{O}_\sigma| = \frac{\sum_{j \in I_n}|\mathcal{Fix}_\sigma(j)|}{o(\sigma)} \tag 2$$ where $\mathcal{O}_\sigma:=\lbrace O_\sigma(j), j \in I_n\rbrace$ . Lemma. $\forall \sigma \in S_n, \forall j \in I_n$ , $\exists l, 1 \le l \le o(\sigma)$ , such that $\sigma^i(j) \ne \sigma^k(j), \forall i,k, 1 \le i< k \le l$ . Proof. Call $V_\sigma(j):=\lbrace k \in I_{o(\sigma)} \mid \sigma^k(j)=j \rbrace$ ; note that $1 \le o(\sigma) \in V_\sigma(j)$ , so that $V_\sigma(j) \cap \mathbb{Z}_+ \ne \emptyset$ . For the Well-Ordering Principle, $\exists m=m(\sigma,j)$ such that $m=\operatorname{min}V_\sigma(j)$ . Suppose, by contrapositive, that $\exists i,k, 1 \le i < k \le m$ such that $\sigma^i(j)=\sigma^k(j)$ ; then, $\sigma^{k-i}(j)=j$ and then $k-i \in V_\sigma(j)$ ; but $i \ge 1 \Rightarrow -i \le -1 \Rightarrow k-i \le k-1 \le m-1 < m = \operatorname{min}V_\sigma(j) \Rightarrow$ $k-i \notin V_\sigma(j)$ : contradiction. Therefore, the positive integer $m$ is the $l$ claimed in the Lemma. $\Box$ In turn, the positive integer $l=l(\sigma,j)$ claimed in the Lemma is $|O_\sigma(j)|$ given by $(1)$ . So, finally, $\forall \sigma \in S_n, \exists \lbrace i_1,\dots,i_r \rbrace \subseteq I_n$ , with $r=|\mathcal{O}_\sigma|$ given by $(2)$ , such that: \begin{alignat}{1}
\mathcal{O_\sigma}=\{O(i_k), k=1,\dots,r\}=\lbrace &\lbrace \sigma(i_1), \sigma^2(i_1),\dots,\sigma^{l(\sigma,i_1)}(i_1)=i_1 \rbrace, \\
&\lbrace \sigma(i_2), \sigma^2(i_2),\dots,\sigma^{l(\sigma,i_2)}(i_2)=i_2 \rbrace, \\
&\dots, \\
&\lbrace \sigma(i_r), \sigma^2(i_r),\dots,\sigma^{l(\sigma,i_r)}(i_r)=i_r \rbrace \rbrace \\
\tag 3
\end{alignat} and $\sum_{k=1}^r l(\sigma,i_k)=n$ . Q1: Is this formulation correct? Q2: Can I use it to derive the decomposition of $\sigma$ into its disjoint cycles, $\sigma=c_{\sigma,i_1} c_{\sigma,i_2} \dots c_{\sigma,i_r}$ , by a suitable definition of the $c_{\sigma,i_k}$ 's prompted by $(3)$ ? I expected so, but I can't conclude. Edit . (Subscripts "" $_\sigma$ "" omitted) For every orbit, let's define $\alpha_k$ the extension by the identity map of the restriction of $\sigma$ to the orbit $O(i_k)$ , namely: \begin{alignat}{1}
\alpha_k(j):=\sigma(j), j \in O(i_k) \\
\alpha_k(j):=j, j \in O(i_{l\ne k}) \\
\tag 4
\end{alignat} Firstly, $\alpha_k \in S_n, k=1,\dots,k$ , because $\sigma_{|O(i_K)} \in \operatorname{Sym}(O(i_k))$ . Then, since $j \in O(i_m) \Rightarrow$ $\sigma(j) \in O(i_m)$ , it is: \begin{alignat}{1}
&\alpha_k^{l_k}(\sigma^j(i_k))=\sigma^{l_k}(\sigma^j(i_k))=\sigma^j(\sigma^{l_k}(i_k))=\sigma^j(i_k), j=1,\dots,l_k \Leftrightarrow \alpha_k^{l_k}(j)=j, j \in O(i_k)\\
&\alpha_k^{l_k}(j)=j, j \in O(i_{j\ne k})
\end{alignat} and finally $$\alpha_k^{l_k}=\iota_{S_n}, k=1,\dots,r \tag 5$$ So, $\alpha_k$ is a $l_k$ -cycle, $k=1,\dots,r$ . Moreover, by definition $(4)$ , for $l\ne k$ we get: \begin{alignat}{1}
&(\alpha_l\alpha_k)(j)=\alpha_l(\alpha_k(j))=\alpha_l(\sigma(j))=\sigma(j), j \in O(i_k) \\
&(\alpha_l\alpha_k)(j)=\alpha_l(\alpha_k(j))=\alpha_l(j)=\sigma(j), j \in O(i_l)\\
&(\alpha_l\alpha_k)(j)=\alpha_l(\alpha_k(j))=\alpha_l(j)=j, j \in O(i_{j\ne k,l}) \\
\end{alignat} or, equivalently: \begin{alignat}{1}
&(\alpha_l\alpha_k)(j)=\sigma(j), j \in O(i_k) \sqcup O(i_l) \\
&(\alpha_l\alpha_k)(j)=j, j \in O(i_{j\ne k,l}) \\
\end{alignat} By induction, \begin{alignat}{1}
&(\alpha_1\dots\alpha_r)(j)=\sigma(j), j \in O(i_1) \sqcup \dots \sqcup O(i_r)=I_n \\
&(\alpha_l\alpha_k)(j)=j, j \in \emptyset \\
\end{alignat} and finally: $$\alpha_1\dots\alpha_r=\sigma \tag 6$$","['permutations', 'permutation-cycles', 'finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

The square may come from the growth rate of the Mertens function $M(n) = \sum_{r \le n}\mu(r)$ while the appearance $\zeta(2)$ may be due to the fact that it appears in many sums involving the Pillai function $P(n) = \sum_{r \le n} \gcd(n,r)$ .

3296853,A series for $\log (a) \log (b)$ in terms of hypergeometric function,"I was experimenting with Frullani integral again, and obtained a very curious series: $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{{_2 F_1} (2k+1,2k+1;4k+2;s)}{(2k+1)^2 \binom{4k+2}{2k+1} r^{2k+1}}= \frac{1}{4} \log (a) \log (b)$$ Here: $$r= \frac{1}{2} \frac{ab+1+a+b}{ab+1-a-b} \left(1+\sqrt{1-\frac{16 ab}{(ab+1+a+b)^2}} \right)$$ $$s= \frac{2\sqrt{1-\frac{16 ab}{(ab+1+a+b)^2}}}{1+\sqrt{1-\frac{16 ab}{(ab+1+a+b)^2}}} $$ For example: $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{{_2 F_1} (2k+1,2k+1;4k+2;\sqrt{3}-1)}{(2k+1)^2 \binom{4k+2}{2k+1} (3+\sqrt{3})^{2k+1}}= \frac{1}{4} \log (2) \log (3)$$ What's really amazing is that $7$ terms of the series already give $16$ correct digits for the right hand side: $0.1903750026047022 \ldots$ . On the other hand $48$ terms give $100$ correct digits. The result might be pretty useless for computations, because the terms feature hypergeometric functions, but they are a very special case ( ${_2 F_1} (n,n;2n;x)$ ) and probably have some special properties which could make them easier to evaluate. Have you seen any series like that? Is there a list of series with ${_2 F_1}$ terms which have elementary closed forms? How would you prove this result? Can it lead to any useful or interesting identities? As a more practical question, can we express $a(r,s)$ and $b(r,s)$ in radicals? The way I obtained the series is too long to fully provide here, but I started with a double Frullani integral: $$\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \frac{d x dy}{x y} (e^{-x}-e^{-a x})(e^{-y}-e^{-b y})=\log (a) \log (b)$$ Then used polar substitution $x= \rho \cos \phi$ , $y= \rho \sin \phi$ , integrated w.r.t. $\rho$ , used half-angle tangent substitution, expanded the logarithm and then integrated each term using Appell function which then reduced to hypergeometric function. Update: Using a known transformation, we can write: $${_2 F_1} (2k+1,2k+1;4k+2;x)= \frac{1}{(1-x/2)^{2k+1}} {_2 F_1} \left(k+\frac12,k+1;2k+\frac32;\frac{x^2}{(2-x)^2}\right)$$ Which makes the particular case above more beautiful since both the parameters become rational: $$\color{blue}{\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{{_2 F_1} \left(k+\frac12,k+1;2k+\frac32;\frac{1}{3}\right)}{(2k+1)^2 \binom{4k+2}{2k+1} 3^{2k+1}}= \frac{1}{4} \log (2) \log (3)}$$ In the general case the parameters also become rational: $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{{_2 F_1} \left(k+\frac12,k+1;2k+\frac32;u\right)}{(2k+1)^2 \binom{4k+2}{2k+1} v^{2k+1}}= \frac{1}{4} \log (a) \log (b)$$ Where: $$u= 1-\frac{16 ab}{(ab+1+a+b)^2} $$ $$v= \frac{1}{2} \frac{ab+1+a+b}{ab+1-a-b} $$ It seems that for $a,b>0$ we have $0<u<1$ and $v>1/2$ which is good for convergence. Update 2: Using Euler integral for the hypergeometric function, and summing the series we obtain another, more simple identity: $$\int_0^1 \text{arctanh} \left(\frac{1}{2v} \sqrt{\frac{x(1-x)}{1-u x}} \right) \frac{dx}{x \sqrt{(1-x)(1-u x)}}=\frac{1}{2} \log (a) \log (b)$$ While the general solution for $a(u,v)$ and $b(u,v)$ eludes me, there's a single parameter case that's easy to express: $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{{_2 F_1} \left(k+\frac12,k+1;2k+\frac32;\frac{1}{p}\right)}{(2k+1)^2 \binom{4k+2}{2k+1} p^{2k+1}}= \frac{1}{4} \log \left(\frac{2 p+\sqrt{8 p+1}+1}{2 (p-1)} \right) \log \left(\frac{2 p+\sqrt{8 p+1}+1}{2 p} \right)$$ $$p>1$$","['integration', 'logarithms', 'hypergeometric-function', 'sequences-and-series']"
3296855,What is the period of Langton's ant on a torus?,"Langton's ant runs on an infinite white grid. At every white square, it turns right, flips the color of the square, and moves forward one square. At every black square, it turns left, flips the color of the square, and moves forward one square.

It follows its two rules, thus changing the coloring of the torus. At some point, however, it encounters a colouration it has seen before, while being in the same spot as before, and finds itself in a cycle. How do we find the length of a cycle for a size $n$ torus, and is this result known?

However, when I undid all the integration by parts to substitute in the original integral, both sides had the same terms and I ended up with $$0 = 0.$$ Is there any other way to solve this integral?","['integration', 'indefinite-integrals', 'partial-fractions']"

3297225,Why do the digits of a number squared follow a similar quotient?,"I realized that, any number $k$ with $n$ digits, and when $k$ is squared, i.e $k^2$ will have $2n-1$ or $2n$ digits. Per example, let $k = 583$ , thus $n = 3$ and the digits of $583^2$ are $2n$ . But I started thinking, how can I narrow the result to be more precise? But, I asked myself. How can I determine when I will have $2n-1$ or $2n$ digits? What I did was the following: $1)$ The last number of $1$ digit whose square has $2n-1$ digits, is $3$ since $3^2 = 9$ , and the next number $4^2 = 16$ have $2n$ digits. And the quotient between the max numbers of $1$ digit( $9$ ) and the last number of $1$ digit to the pow of $2$ with $2n-1$ digits(3) is: $9/3 = 3$ $2)$ The last number of $2$ digits whose square has $2n-1$ digits, is $31$ , since $31^2 = 961$ . The quotient here is $3.19354839$ $3)$ The last number of $3$ digits whose square has $2n-1$ digits, is $316$ since $316^2 = 99856$ . The quotient here is $3.16139241$ $4)$ The last number of $8$ digits whose square has $2n-1$ digits, is $31622776$ , since $31622776^2 = 9.9999996\cdot10^{14}$ . The quotient here is $3.16227768871$ The quotient is each time smaller and closer to $3.16$ $i)$ Why does the quotient between the largest number with $n$ digits and the last number with $n$ digits squared that have $2n-1$ follow this ""pattern"" closer and closer to $3.16$ ? $i)$ With this I can assure for all numbers that: If i have a number, per example $k = 7558$ and $k$ have $4$ digits and the quotient between $9999/7558 < 3.2$ , then $k$ have $2n = 8$ digits? That more generally, I can assure you this?: If i have a number $k$ with $n$ digits, this number have $2n$ digits if $\frac{10^{n}-1}{k} \leq 3.2$ otherwise it will have $2n-1$ digits",['number-theory']

3297283,Dixmier's lemma as a generalisation of Schur's first lemma,"What mathematicians call Schur's lemma is known to physicists as Schur's second lemma : An intertwiner of two irreducible representations of a group is
either zero or isomorphism. It is valid for all dimensionalities -- finite, countable,
   uncountable. The following statement is referred to in physics books as Schur's first lemma : An intertwiner from an irreducible representation to itself is a scalar times the identity operator. In finite dimensions, the latter lemma easily follows from the former one: Let $\,{\mathbb{A}}\,$ be the said irreducible representation, with
an element $\,g\,$ of the group $\,G\,$ mapped to an operator $\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,$ . If $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ is an intertwiner, i.e.,
if $~{\mathbb{M}}\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,=\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,{\mathbb{M}}~$ for $\,\forall\, g\in G\,$ , then $~({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,\lambda\,{\mathbb{I}})\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,=\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,\lambda\,{\mathbb{I}})\,$ ,
where $\,\lambda\,$ is any eigenvalue of $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ , while $\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is the identity matrix. Schur's Second Lemma says
that the matrix $\,({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,\lambda\,{\mathbb{I}})\,$ is
either zero or nonsingular. The latter option, however, is excluded
because the eigenvector corresponding to $\,\lambda\,$ is mapped by
the operator $~({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,\lambda\,{\mathbb{I}})\,{\mathbb{A}}_g\,$ to
zero. So this is a zero operator, and $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,=\,\lambda\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ . $\left.\qquad\right.$ ${\mathbb{QED}}$ This proof works only for finite dimensions, because it requires a nonzero $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ to possess at least one nonzero eigenvalue. A generalisation of Schur's first lemma to countable dimensions is Dixmier's lemma . I present its formulation for group representations, because this is the language understandable to a physicist. Suppose that $\,V\,$ is a countable-dimension vector space over $\,{\mathbb{C}}\,$ and that $\,{\mathbb{A}}\,$ is a group
representation acting irreducibly on $\,V\,$ . If the intertwiner $\,{\mathbb{M}}\in\,$ Hom $\,_C(V, V )\,$ commutes with the action of $\,{\mathbb{A}}\,$ , then there exists a number $\,c\in{\mathbb{C}}\,$ for 
which $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is not invertible on the space $\,V\,$ . Proof To employ reductio ad absurdum , start with an assumption that the map $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is invertible for $\,\forall c\in {\mathbb{C}}\,$ .
 Then, for any non-zero polynomial $$\,P(x)\,=\,(x-p_1)\,(x-p_2)\,.\,.\,.\,(x-p_N)\,\;,$$ invertible is the map $$\,P({\mathbb{M}})\,=\,({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,p_1\,{\mathbb{I}})\,({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,p_2\,{\mathbb{I}})\,.\,.\,.\,({\mathbb{M}}\,-\,p_N\,{\mathbb{I}})\,\;,$$ because the composition of invertible maps is invertible. Consider all rational functions $\,R(x)\,=\,P(x)/Q(x)\,$ , with $\,P(x)\,$ and $\,Q(x)\,$ complex-valued polynomials in a complex variable $\,x\,$ .
 Defined on $\,{\mathbb{C}}\,$ except an unspecified finite subset (allowed to vary with each function), they constitute a space $\,{\mathbb{C}}(x)\,$ over $\,{\mathbb{C}}\,$ . While the space $\,{\mathbb{C}}[x]\,$ of polynomials is of countable dimensions over $\,{\mathbb{C}}\,$ , the space $\,{\mathbb{C}}(x)\,$ of rational functions is of uncountable dimensions. For any $\,R(x)\,=\,P(x)/Q(x)\,$ , there exists a map $\,R({\mathbb{M}})\,=\,P({\mathbb{M}})/Q({\mathbb{M}})\,$ .
  Hence a map $$
 {\mathbb{C}}(x)\,\longrightarrow\,\mbox{Hom}_C\,(V,\,V)\,\;.
 $$ As we saw above, our initial assumption that the map $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is invertible for $\,\forall c\in {\mathbb{C}}\,$ implies that all nonzero polynomials in $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ are invertible. For an invertible polynomial $\,Q({\mathbb{M}})\,$ , invertible is the map $\,1/Q({\mathbb{M}})\,$ . So the maps $\,R({\mathbb{M}})\,=\,\left(\,Q({\mathbb{M}})\,\right)^{-1}\,P({\mathbb{M}})\,$ are compositions of invertible transformations, and thus are invertible. Stated alternatively, if $\,v\in V\,$ is non-zero, then $\,R({\mathbb{M}})\, v\,=\,0\,$ necessitates $\,P({\mathbb{M}})v\,=\,0\,$ . This, in its turn, can be true only if $\,P\,$ is the zero polynomial: $\;P(x)\,=\,0\;$ and, therefore, $\,R\,$ is the zero function, $\,R(x)\,=\,0\,$ . In other words, only one element of the space $\,{\mathbb{C}}(x)\,$ , the function $\,R(x)\,=\,0\,$ , is mapped to the zero element $\,R({\mathbb{M}})\,=\,0\,$ of the space $\,\mbox{Hom}_C\,(V,\,V)\,$ . Hence the map $\,{\mathbb{C}}(x)\,\longrightarrow\,\mbox{Hom}_C\,(V,\,V)\,$ is injection -- which implies that the dimensionality of $\,\mbox{Hom}_C\,(V,\,V)\,$ is uncountable, because such is the dimensionality of ${\mathbb{C}}(x)\,$ . This, however, is incompatible with the assumption that $\,V\,$ is of countable dimensions. ${\mathbb{QED}}$ Now, my question. We have proven that, for some $\,c\in{\mathbb{C}}\,$ , the operator $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is not invertible. Can we now use Schur's second lemma, to state that $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ is a scalar multiple of the identity operator? In finite dimensions, the noninvertibility of $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is equivalent to $\,c\,$ being an eigenvalue of the matrix $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ . However, in infinite dimensions this is not necessarily so. When $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is noninvertible (while the linear operator $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ is bounded), $\,c\,$ is said to belong to the spectrum of $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ -- which does not necessitate it being an eigenvalue. An operator on an  infinite-dimensional space may have a nonempty spectrum and, at the same time, lack eigenvalues. Despite this circumstance, will it be legitimate to say that, if $\exists\,c\in{\mathbb{C}}\,$ for which $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is not invertible, $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,$ is an intertwiner of an irreducible representation to itself, Schur's second lemma works in all dimensions, then $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,-\,c\,{\mathbb{I}}\,=\,0\,$ and $\,{\mathbb{M}}\,$ is proportional to the identity operator?","['group-theory', 'operator-theory', 'representation-theory']"

3297344,Are Sequences Continuous?,"This might be a dumb question, but if so it will at least be easy to answer. Let $X$ and $Y$ be metric spaces. Let $A \subseteq X$ . Let $a \in A$ . Let $f : A \to Y$ be a map.

Let $n$ be any positive integer. Let $a_n$ denote the value of the map $(a_n)$ at $n$ . Let $\varepsilon > 0$ .
