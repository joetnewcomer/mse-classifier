609078,Divisibility of binomial coefficient by prime power - Kummer's theorem,"Let's say we have binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{m}$. And we need to find the greatest power of prime $p$ that divides it. Usually Kummer's theorem is stated in terms of the number of carries you perform while adding $m$ and $n-m$ in base $p$. I found an equivalent statement of this theorem that reads like this: if we write
$$
\binom{n}{m}\equiv\binom{n_0}{m_0}\binom{n_1}{m_1}\ldots\binom{n_d}{m_d}\pmod{p},
$$
where $n = n_0 + n_1p + n_2p^2 + \ldots + n_dp^d$ and $m = m_0 + m_1p + m_2p^2 + \ldots + m_dp^d$, then the power dividing $\binom{n}{m}$ is precisely the number of indicies $i$ for which $n_i<m_i$. Now let's take an example. Let's look at $\binom{25}{1}$ and $p=5$. We have
$$
\binom{25}{1}\equiv\binom{1}{0}\binom{0}{0}\binom{0}{1}\pmod{5}.
$$
We have only one index $i$ for which $n_i < m_i$, which is the last one. This suggests that $\binom{25}{1}$ can't be divided by $25$, which obviously isn't true. Where's the problem?

609124,Show that the nth order statistic is a consistent estimator of a uniform parameter,"We assume that our observations come from a uniform $(0,\theta)$ distribution. Can you please check my work on the following? We can derive the distribution function of the maximum of the sample, $Y_n$ for some $t$ as follows: $$ F_{Y_n} (t)= \begin{cases}  1 \quad t> \theta \\ \left( \frac{t}{\theta} \right)^n \quad 0<t \leq \theta \\ 0 \quad t\leq 0 \end{cases} $$ Now the definition of consistence states for our estimator $Y_n$ to be consistent we require that $\lim_{n\to \infty} P\left[|Y_n - \theta| <\epsilon \right]=1$ for all $\epsilon>0$ Using the above CDF, $P\left[ \theta< Y_n<\epsilon+\theta \right]=1-\left(\frac{\epsilon}{\theta} \right)^n$ The second term goes to zero in the limit so we get $1$.

609131,Killing the automorphisms to make a functor representable,"I was told (quickly) by my professor about the following yoga: Say we want to define a functor $F:\operatorname{Sch}\to \operatorname{Set}$ which parametrizes some class of objects. If those objects have nontrivial automorphisms, then we cannot expect $F$ to be representable. There are two solutions to this issues: Sheafify the functor $F$ in order to obtain an fppf sheaf Rigidify the objects we want to parametrize, in order to kill their automorphisms Now, at the present moment I don't have the time to go through the underlying theory. So $$$$ Could you give me some intuition on the above yoga? Why are the automorphisms an obstruction to the representability of the functor? What does it mean, in simple terms, for a functor to be a fppf sheaf? $$$$ I have a motivating example for this question: Let $X$ and $T$ be schemes over $S$ ; the relative Picard functor $Pic_{X/S}:Sch_S \to Ab$ is defined by $$ T \mapsto \left\{ \text{Rigidified line bundles}\text{ on } X_T/T \right\} $$ and not as $$ T \mapsto \left\{ \text{Line bundles}\text{ on } X_T/T \right\} $$ The main difference between line bundles and rigidified ones is that the latter don't have any nontrivial automorphisms. Under reasonable hypothesis the first functor turns out to be representable, while the first one doesn't.","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
609135,The limit supremum of a function involving Brownian motion,"I would like, for some $\delta>0$ and a Brownian motion $B$, to calculate $\displaystyle\limsup_{t\to\infty}\left(\exp\left( (1+\delta)t\right)\cdot\exp\left(-B_t-\frac{t}{2}\right)\right)$ which, upon calculation, is equal to $\displaystyle\limsup_{t\to\infty}\left(\exp\left(t\left(\frac12+\delta\right)\right)\exp\left(-B_t\right)\right)$. I reckon this is $\infty$, simply by looking at the function and noting that the least upper bound for the Brownian motion must be infinite. This doesn't seem to be a satisfactory argument. I tried arguing via the law of the iterated logarithm and similar results but very quickly got stuck. If I am right in saying that the value is infinite, surely there must be a short argument which doesn't fall into the category of ""proof by handwaving""?

609222,T. Y. Lam's definition for the rank of a projective module,"This is a concept from Lectures on Modules and Rings of T. Y. Lam. It's on page 34-35 of the book. Throughout this post, $R$ will be used to denote a commutative ring. Let $P$ be a f.g $R-$projective module. For any prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subset R$, the localization $P_{\mathfrak{p}} := P \otimes_R R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is also a f.g projective $R_{\mathfrak{p}}-$module. $\color{green}{\textbf{I get this part. Yay!!!}}$ Since $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a local ring, $P_{\mathfrak{p}}$ must actually be free (by FC 19.29). $\color{green}{\textbf{Sounds good!!!}}$, say $P_{\mathfrak{p}} \cong R_{\mathfrak{p}}^{n_{\mathfrak{p}}}$ (for some $n_\mathfrak{p} \in \mathbb{N}$), so we have a function $f: \text{Spec}(R) \to \mathbb{Z}$, sending each $\mathfrak{p}$ to $n_\mathfrak{p}$. If that function $f$ is constant, i.e $n_\mathfrak{p} = n, \forall \mathfrak{p} \in \text{Spec}{R}$, we shall say that $P$ has rank $n$. And denote it as: $\text{rk}(P) = n$. $\color{red}{\textbf{What I don't really get is the idea behind this definition.}}$. And then, the author leaves a fact unproved: Fact. Let $P$, $Q$ be two f.g projective $R-$modules of rank $n$, and $m$ respectively. Show that $\text{rk}(P^*) = n$, and $\text{rk}(P\otimes_RQ) = nm$, where $P^* = \text{Hom}_R(P; R)$. I think it should be very easy, since the author doesn't prove it. So here's my try on the problem. Since $P$, $Q$ are both f.g $R-$projective, there exists $R-$modules $P'$, and $Q'$, such that $R^i = P\oplus P'$, and $R^j = Q\oplus Q'$. So we'll have: $R^i = \text{Hom}(R^i,R) = \text{Hom}(P \oplus P',R) = \text{Hom}(P,R) \oplus \text{Hom}(P',R)$ $R^j = \text{Hom}(R^j,R) = \text{Hom}(Q \oplus Q',R) = \text{Hom}(Q,R) \oplus \text{Hom}(Q',R)$ So basically, we'll have $P \oplus P' \cong \text{Hom}(P,R) \oplus \text{Hom}(P',R)$, and $Q \oplus Q' \cong \text{Hom}(Q,R) \oplus \text{Hom}(Q',R)$. How can I proceed from here? Is this the correct way to start? I just wanna ask 2 things: Firstly, can you guys please give me the idea (or some motivation) behind this definition for the rank of a projective modules? Secondly, can you guys check my work (are there any subtle errors, or something), and give me a little push on the problem? :( Thank you so much for your help, And have a good day,","['modules', 'projective-module', 'abstract-algebra']"

Note that if $X$ is of finite dimension we can identify $X$ with $\mathbb{C}^n$ for some natural $n$ and endow it with a norm $\|x\|=|x_1|+\ldots+|x_n|$ . Thus $X$ becomes a banach space. However, if $X$ has a countable dimension, we cannot endow it with a banach norm! Really, suppose $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots\}$ is a countable Hamel base in $X$ . It is easy to see that $X_n=\mathrm{Span}(x_1,\ldots, x_n)$ is closed and does not contain any ball. But $X$ is a union of $X_n$ hence $X$ cannot be a full metric space under Baire theorem!

609336,Find the maximum of an integral function with respect to another function,"I'm facing this statistical data analysis problem, where I have to maximize a certain statistic in order to find the optimal filtering function. I'm a little bit out of practice with the mathematics needed for solving it... Well, the statistic I got from the Neyman-Pearson Lemma is a function of the data set $\{s(t)\}$ and of some ($6$) unknown functions $S^{AB}(t)$ (symmetric under $A \leftrightarrow B$), with $A,B=1,2,3$, of the form:
$$\Lambda\big(s(t)\big)=\sum_{A,B}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \mathrm{d}t\ M^{AB}\big(s(t)\big)\,S^{AB}(t).$$
$M^{AB}\big(s(t)\big)$ is a known function of the data set. For the sake of simplicity of the notation, I considered continuous times and an infinite interval of integration. Of course this is not true in practice but I think it won't matter for this analysis problem. In order to evaluate the $6$ unknown functions $S^{AB}(f)$ through their maximum likelihood estimators , I'm asked to maximize $\Lambda$:
$$\widehat{S^{AB}}:\qquad \max_{S^{AB}}\Lambda\big(s(t)\big).$$ Well, tese are my attempts: in order to find this maximum, I thought to find the derivative of $\Lambda\big(s(t)\big)$ with respect to $S^{AB}$ and impose it equals to zero for every $A,B$:
$$ {\partial\over\partial S^{A'B'}}\Lambda\big(s(t)\big)=0.$$How could I perform this derivative? Can I consider the unknown function as an independent variable and put the derivative inside the integrand, writing:
$$\sum_{A,B}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\mathrm{d}t\,M^{AB}(t)\delta^{AA'}\delta^{BB'}=0$$
which does not depends on the filtering functions I'm looking for... Is it correct? How can I interpret this result? Also, I thought to try to solve the problem with this change of variables:
$$ {\partial\over\partial S^{A'B'}}\Lambda\big(s(t)\big)= \left|{\partial S^{A'B'}\over\partial t}\right|^{-1}{\partial\over\partial t}\Lambda=\left|{\partial S^{A'B'}\over\partial t}\right|^{-1}\sum_{A,B}M^{AB}(t)\,S^{AB}(t)=0$$

So the proof uses Dynkin's $\pi$-system lemma to show we get all indicator functions of sets in $\mathcal{F}$, then use the upwards approximation by simple functions of the form $2^{-n}\lfloor2^{n}f\rfloor \wedge n$. My question is whether we can extend the result to include all measurable functions, including unbounded ones. It seems like the proof carries over, and one might think that boundedness is necessary to ensure the construction $2^{-n}\lfloor2^{n}f\rfloor \wedge n$ takes on finitely many values but it already does so as we are bounding it by $n$.

609434,Proper ideal containing power of maximal ideal is primary? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : An ideal whose radical is maximal is primary (4 answers) Closed 5 years ago . In Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra, Chapter 3.9, it says, ""If $P$ is a maximal ideal of $R$ and $I$ is any proper ideal containing a power of $P$, then $I$ is $P$-primary: For in this case $P$ is the only prime containing the annihilator $I$ of $R/I$."" If the power $n$ is 1, it's trivial by definition, but for $n>1$ I don't see why this is true. First why $P^n\subseteq I$  implies $I\subseteq P$? And since $R$ is not necessarily local ring, why it's not possible that there is another maximal ideal $Q$ so that $P^n\subseteq I \subseteq Q$ for $n>1$?","['commutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"
609437,Two different M/G/Infinity queues,"I need some help with this problem. We have a service system where customers arrive randomly, following a Poisson process (intensity λ). The times that the customers spend in service are independent, following a Weibull distribution with parameters α > 0 and β > 0. The times in service are also independent of the arrival process. The system has an infinite number of service stations and infinite capacity. In the problem, the system is simulated and we get a set of data. The data is a random sample of number of customers at random times. We do two simulations with the parameters: α1 = 0.0241
β1 =  2 α2 = 1.75
β2 = 1 Since the system has got an infinite number of service stations and an infinite capacity, we get two different M/G/∞ queues, and in this case it is known that L/W = λ, which gives me the expected number of customers in the system L = λ*W. W is the theoretic average (the expected value) of the Weibull distribution. We get L1 = 19.980

The result that $y$ is a translation of $x$ reminds me of Lie symmetries of ODEs. The condition (SYM) feels like, smells like, tastes like a symmetry condition. But symmetry methods involve changing the coordinates of the ODE to canonical coordinates and here we are not doing this? Or are we? My question is: Is there a way of interpreting (*) as arising from some change of variables as in the symmetry analysis of ODEs? If so, how? Sorry if this is all too obvious. \begin{align} 
&F(x,x)\,x^\prime(t)-F(x,y)\,y^\prime(t)-1=0 \tag{ODE_1}\\ \\

&F(x(t),x(t))+F(x(t),y(t))=F(y(t),x(t))+F(y(t),y(t)) \tag{SYM}.
\end{align} We also are assuming the ODE system is not under-determined, that is we can be solve it for $x^\prime$ and $y^\prime$. For almost all $x$ and $y$ we require:
$$ \det \pmatrix{ F(x,x) & F(x,y) \\ F(x,y) & F(y,y)}\neq 0 $$ Notice also SYM does not hold for any $x,y$ but only for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ that solve the ODE system.","['symmetry', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'lie-groups']"

$$\|A\|=\sup \frac{\|Ax\|}{\|x\|} \text{ and } \|x\|=1$$
so take $f \in C[0,1]$ and I went to it:
\begin{align*}
\|A\| &= \sup \frac{\|Af(t)\|}{\|f(t)\|} \\

609739,The existence of a singular point on the circle of convergence (Ahlfors),"I want to solve the following exercise from Ahlfors' complex analysis text. Below is my attempt followed by questions I have regarding it: If a function element is defined by a power series inside its circle of convergence, supposed to be of finite radius, prove that at least one radius is a singular path for the global analytic function which it determines. (""A power series has at least one singular point on its circle of convergence."") Here is my attempt: Let $f$ be defined and analytic in the disk $\Delta(z_0;R)$ where $R<\infty$ is the radius of convergence around the point $z_0$. Let $\mathbf{f}$ be the global analytic function determined by the function element $(f,\Delta(z_0;R))$, and let $\mathfrak{S}_0(\mathbf{f})$ be its Riemann surface (which is a connected component of the sheaf of germs of analytic functions). For $\theta \in[0,2 \pi)$ denote by $\gamma_\theta:[0,R] \to \mathbb C$ the radius of the circle of convergence parallel to $e^{i \theta}$ (i.e. $\gamma_\theta(t)=z_0+t e^{i \theta}$), and by $\overline{\gamma_\theta}:[0,R] \to \mathfrak{S_0}(\mathbf{f})$ the unique analytic continuation of $\mathbf{f}$ along $\gamma$ (if it exists). By way of contradiction suppose that none of the radii are a singular path. We can extend $f$ to a (univalent) function $F$ which is analytic in a larger concentric disk, and  coincides with $f$ on the original disk $\Delta(z_0;R)$. Clearly, this should be done using analytic continuation along all radii. I would like to define $F$ the following way: For $z \in \Delta(z_0;R)$ set trivially $F(z)=f(z)$ For any germ $\overline{\gamma_\theta}(R)$, consider its power series expansion at $z_0+R e^{i \theta}$. For all points $z$ in the series' disk of convergence, which are not in $\Delta(z_0;R)$, set $F(z)$ to be the value of the series at $z$. The second part seems to be ambiguous, since several different germs may define $F$ at the same point $z \notin \Delta(z_0;R)$. We will now prove that there is no ambiguity. Let $z \notin \Delta(z_0;R)$ be a ""possible ambiguous point"" for $F$. Thus there exist germs $\overline{\gamma_{\theta_1}}(R),\overline{\gamma_{\theta_2}}(R)$ with $\theta_1 \neq \theta_2$ and with power series developments $F_1,F_2$ which converge in the disks $\Delta_1,\Delta_2$ centered at $z_0+Re^{i \theta_1},z_0+Re^{i \theta_2}$ respectively, where both disks contain $z$. Ahlfors has previously proven the equivalence between analytic continuation along arcs and along chains of function elements. Using his construction we can form a chain $\{(f_k,\Omega_k \}_{k=1}^N$ of function elements which follow the radius $\gamma_{\theta_1}$. Combining this with the fact that the analytic continuation along an arc is unique, we find that $$f_{N-1} \big|_{\Delta(z_0;R) \cap \Omega_{N-1}} \equiv f,$$ thus the identity theorem for analytic functions gives $$F_1 \equiv f $$ on $\Delta_1 \cap \Delta(z_0;R)$. Similarly, we find that $$F_2 \equiv f $$ on $\Delta_2 \cap \Delta(z_0;R).$ Now I would like to say that the intersection $\Delta_1 \cap \Delta_2 \cap \Delta(z_0;R)$ is nonempty (by some geometric argument), and from there applying the identity theorem one last time will yield $F_1(z)=F_2(z)$. Hence, $F$ is indeed a univalent analytic function which extends $f$ to an open neighborhood of $\overline{\Delta(z_0;R)}$. By elementary topology, this open neighborhood contains a larger disk $\Delta(z_0,R+\epsilon)$ concentric  with $\Delta(z_0,R)$, contradicting the maximality of the radius of convergence. Questions: Overall, is my solution correct? More specifically, how would one go about proving the ""geometric argument"" that $\Delta(z_0,R) \cap \Delta_1 \cap \Delta_2 \neq \emptyset$?

609757,Sum of Homogeneous Ideals vs Homogeneous Ideal of Intersection,"Sorry for the recent question spam, but I've been striving furiously over the last few days to solve a problem in Hartshorne ( Algebraic Geometry ) discussed in this question . The problem (II.8.4a) says: Let $Y$ be a closed subscheme of codimension $r$ in $\mathbb{P}^n_k$ ($k$ algebraically closed). Then the homogeneous ideal of $Y$ is generated by $r$ elements in $S=k[x_0,...,x_n]$ if and only if $Y$ is equal to the scheme-theoretic intersection of $r$-many hypersurfaces (locally principal closed subschemes), i.e., $\mathcal{I}_Y=\mathcal{I}_{H_1}+\cdots+\mathcal{I}_{H_r}$ where these are ideal sheaves. Hartshorne gives the hint to use the unmixedness theorem for $S$. The direction $\implies$ is easy. I'm trying to prove the other (where we assume $Y$ is a scheme theoretic intersection of hypersurfaces). In exploring this problem, I think I've twigged to how it's ""supposed"" to be solved, but it relies on something not obvious to me, but perhaps obvious to the sources I'm appealing to. The something is this: Let $I_{H_1},...,I_{H_r}$ denote the homogeneous ideals of the hypersurfaces, $I_Y$ the saturated homogeneous ideal of their scheme theoretic intersection. Then the primary components of $\sum{I_{H_j}}$ corresponding to minimal primes, and the primary components of $I_Y$ corresponding to minimal primes coincide. In other words, these ideals only differ in their embedded components. (Matt E seems to use something like the above in answering my question here ). Once this is established, the result follows easily from the unmixedness theorem, but again I'm not sure why this should be obvious. These ideals clearly have the same minimal primes, since they cut out the same irreducible subsets of $\mathbb{P}^n$, but as for why the minimal primary components should agree, I'm at a loss.

We are told that on closed intervals uniform continuity = continuity and on open intervals uniform continuity is strong than continuity.
i.e. Let $f : (0,1] \to [1,\infty) $ . $ f $ is continuous on $(0,1]$ but not uniformly continuous. Here is my proof, there are bits that are not correct and I'd like to clear up the confusion. So we know that f is continuous if $\exists c \in (0,1]$ s.t $\forall \epsilon > 0 \exists \delta>0$ s.t if $|x-c| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon $ .
i.e. $|x-y| < \delta  \Rightarrow |1/x - 1/c| = |\frac{x-c}{xc}| < \epsilon$ $|\frac{x-c}{xc}| < |\frac{\delta}{xc}|$ but from here do I set epsilon to $|\frac{\delta}{xc}|$ ? But then epsilon depends on $x$ ? Anyway if I could clean this up then i would be able to show its continuous, but I cant quite manage the last step. After I do this, how do I show its not uniformly continuous?","['uniform-continuity', 'continuity', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
609770,Cups of water from a bucket,"We have an empty container and $n$ cups of water and $m$ empty cups. Suppose we want to find out how many ways we can add the cups of water to the bucket and remove them with the empty cups. You can use each cup once but the cups are unique. The question:  In how many ways can you perform this operation. Example: Let's take $n = 3$ and $m = 2$. For the first step we can only add water to the bucket so we have 3 choices.
For the second step we can both add another cup or remove a cup of water.
So for the first 2 steps we have $3\times(5-1) = 12$ possibilities.
For the third step it gets more difficult because this step depends on the previous step.
There are two scenarios after the second step. 1: The bucket either contains 2 cups of water or 2: The bucket contains no water at all. 1) We can both add or subtract a cup of water
2) We have to add a cup of water So after step 3 we have $3\times(2\cdot3 + 2\cdot2) = 30$ combinations. etc. I hope I stated this question clearly enough since this is my first post. This is not a homework assignment just personal curiosity.",['combinatorics']

609792,Find the number of ways that 2n people may be paired.,"Question: Find the number of ways that 2n people may be paired. I have figured this problem out, and I'm fairly certain that there are $\frac{(2n)!}{2^{n} n!}$ ways. However, I cannot seem to work this out using generating functions. Consider the recurrence relation for this problem. It is given by $a_{n} = (2n-1)a_{n-1}$. It is immediate by inspection that this is just $(2n-1) \cdot (2n-3) \dots 3 \cdot 1$, which agrees with my above answer. However, this does not agree with the way I have been instructed to solve recurrence relations (other than through the use of generating functions), which is to set $a_{n} = \alpha^{n}$, and solve for $\alpha$, which gives us $a_{n} = (2n-1)^{n}$. Why did this approach not work out? And as far as solving this using generating functions, I've worked out that $$g(x) - a_{0} = \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}x^{n}= \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(2n-1)a_{n-1}x^{n}= 2\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n a_{n-1}x^{n} - \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n-1}x^{n}$$ This reduces to: $$g(x)-a_{0} = 2x\displaystyle\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}(m+1)a_{m}x^{m} - xg(x)$$ I'm having trouble re-expressing the power series with the $(m+1)$ multiplier. To this end, I would like to ask if there is a straightforward way to re-express a power series of the form 
$\displaystyle\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}m \cdot a_{m}x^{m}$? I know that $x\left(\frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{1-x}\right) = \displaystyle\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}mx^{m}$, so I figure that $x\left(\frac{d}{dx} g(x) \right)$ should do the trick, but I wasn't able to make that approach work out.","['generating-functions', 'recurrence-relations', 'combinatorics']"

$$
 (f, h)(f', h') = (g, hh') 
$$
where $g$ is defined, for each $q \in H$ by
$$
 g(q) = f(q) + f'(qh).
$$
(the additive notation does not imply it to be commutative!) Now the lamp lighter group is $\mathbb Z_2 \wr \mathbb Z$. So as I see it with the above mentioned definitions for example $f(n) = n \mbox{mod} 2$ and $f'(n) = 1_{\mathbb N}$ (indicator function of the natural numbers) then
$$
 (f, 3) \mbox{ and } (f', 5)
$$
would be both elements of the lamp lighter group, and their product would be $(g, 15)$ with $g(n) = f(n) + f'(n+3)$. But as I read elsewhere, and according to a famous interpretation of this group, as functions are just those allowed for which $\{ n : f(n) = 1 \}$ is finite. But where does this come from, to quote a book: ... consider the lamplighter group $\mathbb Z_2 \wr \mathbb Z$, the wreath product of $\mathbb Z_2$ with $\mathbb Z$. One can define this group by using as a state space $X$ the configuration space of a doubly infinite sequence of lamps (indexed by the inegers), with each lamp being either ""on"" or ""off"", and with at most finitely many of the lamps begin ""on"", together with the position of a lamplighter, located at one of the lamps; more formally, we have $X := (\mathbb Z)^{\mathbb Z}_0 \times \mathbb Z$, where $(\mathbb Z)^{\mathbb Z}_0$ is the space of compactly supported sequences from $\mathbb Z$ to $\mathbb Z_2$. The lamplighter has the ability to toggle the lamp on and off at his or her current location, and also the ability to move left or right... On wikipedia there is a similar interpretation. But where does this interpretation and also the requirement that just functions whose roots are a cofinite set comes from?

So I thought that the comments an answers brought up a great point about increasing the doors to 100 or something much larger, and using that as a way to help visualize why switching is always the best choice when trying to explain the problem to others. And then I was thinking about the game show, Deal or No Deal. For those unfamiliar with Deal or No Deal: there are 26 cases, each containing amounts of money ranging from \$0.01 to one million dollars. You choose one case, and it's ""yours"" and out-of-play (this is analogous to choosing the first door in the Monty Hall problem). Throughout the game you open 24 of the remaining cases, and you see how much money was in each case. In the end, you are left with 2 cases: ""your"" case, that you chose in the beginning, and the only other case you didn't open. This is where it becomes Monty Hall: you can either choose to keep your case, or switch cases and get the other one. So what I'm wondering is, does the Monty Hall logic of ""always switch doors/cases"" apply here? The differences: 1) It's not a case of there being simply 1 car and a bunch of goats. All the money values are different in each case. You aren't always going to end up with a choice between a million dollars or something small... The two remaining cases might end up being \$10,000 and \$250,000. Or it might be \$10 and a million dollars. Or \$10 and $100. 2) I think part of what makes Monty Hall work is that the car always remains in play. Your first choice is a 1/26 probability of selecting the car/million dollar case. But in Deal or No Deal, the car/million dollar case can be eliminated partway through the game. So I'm thinking that probably changes things. My first vague thoughts are... If you make it to the end and the million dollar case still is in play, Monty Hall applies and you should switch cases. Because it's the same idea; I had a 1/26 shot at the million. 24 have been eliminated. It's much more likely that the other case has the million. But if the million is eliminated while you're playing, what then? Can Monty Hall not help us, because you can't compare the probability of selecting the million dollar case because now it's zero? I'm trying to think of a way to figure out whether or not you should switch, in an attempt to get the case with the most money in it . We know that \$1,000,000 is no longer available. But is there anything we can do to decide which case is likely to be more valuable? Or is this outside Monty Hall's bounds?","['game-theory', 'probability', 'monty-hall']"

This plot is usually represented by a line, e.g. $f(x)=x$ is represented by a straight line. Now consider a section of this line, e.g. $f(x)=x$ for $0 \leq x \leq 10$. Measuring the length of this line is trivial by using the Pythagorean Theorem or the Distance Formula, etc. Now consider a graph of a semicircle. In this instance, we can also find the length of the line: we use the radius to find half the circumference. Now consider a different graph, e.g. $f(x)=x^2$. I can think of no direct way to find the length of this line for some interval on $x$. Is there a way? I can propose a way, which, to me, seems intuitively related to Riemann Integration. In Riemann Integration, we try to approximate the area under the graph for some interval by fitting arbitrarily small rectangles between the curve and the x-axis. Similarly, one ought to be able to find the length of a line on some interval
by fitting arbitrarily many right-angled triangles with equal width on the curve: this way, we can partition a curve into arbitrarily many lines that are approximately straight, which we can measure by finding the hypotenuses of our triangles. Then to find the length of the curve, we just sum those hypotenuses. Diagrams for illustration below: As stated: in each image, the approximated length of the line is the sum of the lengths of the green straight lines. Clearly, as we let the size of the triangle base $a$ become arbitrarily small, our approximation of the length of the curve will become more accurate. On a final note, obviously this method has something in common with how we 'intuitively' take a derivative. Any Thoughts?","['graphing-functions', 'calculus', 'functions']"

610383,Alternative methods to prove that $Z_m$ is a field under addition and multiplication $\bmod\ m$ iff $m$ is a prime,"I am looking for ways to prove that $\mathbb{Z}_m=\{0,1,2,\dots,m-1\}$ is a field under addition and multiplication $\bmod\ m$ iff $m$ is a prime. I tried it this way:
If $m$ is a prime $p$,it is obvious that most importantly, we need to prove that every non-zero element in $\mathbb{Z_p}$ has an inverse in $\mathbb{Z_p}$.We note that if $a,b\in \mathbb{Z_p}$, then $a\cdot b\in \mathbb{Z_p} \dots \boxed{*}$. Next, $a^p\equiv a \bmod p$ for prime $p$(the proof follows by induction on $a$).As  $\displaystyle 0\leq a\leq p-1$,$a\not =p$. Thus $$a^{p-1}\equiv 1 \bmod p$$ for prime $p$ which,together with $\boxed{*}$ guarantees the existence of an inverse in $\mathbb{Z_p}$.Proving the other properties is simple. Conversely,if $\mathbb{Z_m}$ is a field,then every non-zero element of $\mathbb{Z_m}$ has an inverse.Note that inverse of an element is unique.For if $a\cdot b\equiv a\cdot c\equiv 1 \bmod m$,then $(a\cdot b)\cdot c\equiv c\equiv (a\cdot c)\cdot b\equiv b \bmod m$ i.e $m|(b-c)\implies b-c=0(0\leq a\leq m-1,a\in \mathbb{Z_m})$.So, inverses must be unique and every element is either an inverse of itself or has in inverse in the field.That allows us to conclude that $[(m-1)!]^2\equiv 1 \bmod m$ which can only mean that either 
$(m-1)!\equiv 1 \bmod m$ or $(m-1)!\equiv -1 \bmod m$. If $m$ is not a prime, it has a prime factor, say $p$. $ 0\leq p\leq m-1\implies p|(m-1)!\implies p|1$or $-1$ which is absurd, a contradiction.Thus $m$ is prime. I feel that this method is too involved and complicated. Can anyone please suggest some other method?(Some context: This is a problem from Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces by Paul Halmos.
