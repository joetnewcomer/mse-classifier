1575083,"Cantor's Theorem holding simply because every power set includes a singleton set for each element, and the empty set?","I have just been learning about Cantor's Theorem, which has been stated in by book as ""the carndinality of every set is strictly less than the cardinality of it's power set"", and I have a question about the theorem. In the proof I have been given for Cantor's Theorem, the argument is put forward that the power set contains a singleton set corresponding to each element of the original set, and hence cardX $\le$ cardP(X). They then must just prove that X$\ne$P(X), that is that there exists no surjective function from X to P(X), and hence there can exist no bijective function between them, so the theorem must be true. Is this introductory step correctly stated? If it is, then I don't understand why Cantor's Theorem doesn't trivially hold true. Using the same reasoning, could it not be said that if the power set contains a singleton set corresponding to each element in the original set, but it also contains the empty set, then surely the power set must have strictly greater cardinality than the original set? Does this reasoning perhaps not apply when dealing with infinite sets? If not, please try and provide some intuitive reason why the argument I have supplied above fails.",['elementary-set-theory']

1575093,Intersection theory question from Vakil's notes on Algebraic Geometry,"I cannot seem to solve what I think should be a straightforward intersection theory question in Ravi Vakil's algebraic geometry notes. Let $X$ be a scheme and $Y$ a closed subscheme of dimension less than or equal to $n$, and $\mathscr{L}_1,\ldots,\mathscr{L}_n$ be a collection of line bundles on $X$. Then Vakil defines the intersection product: $$(\mathscr{L}_1 \cdots \mathscr{L}_n\cdot Y)=\sum_{\{i_1,\ldots,i_m\}\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}}\chi(X,\mathscr{L}_{i_1}^\vee\otimes\cdots \otimes \mathscr{L}_{i_m}^\vee \otimes \mathscr{O}_Y)$$
where $\chi$ is the euler characteristic and $\mathscr{O}_Y$ is really its pushforward to $X$. Problem 20.1.B asks if $k$ is field and $X=\mathbb{P}^n_k$ and $Y$ any dimension $n$ subscheme, $\{H_i\}_{i=1}^n$ hypersurfaces of degree $d_i$, then we are asked to show $$(\mathscr{O}(H_1) \cdots \mathscr{O}(H_n)\cdot Y)=d_1\cdots d_n \operatorname{deg}Y$$ I am having a hard time on this, because I cannot seem to find a natural way to induct.

1575121,Ordered Pairs and Set Theory,"So, first of all I'm gonna start with stating that I'm a complete noob in mathematics that started doing this as a hobby. I encounter problems that I can't figure out on a regular basis, like a few times per page but I usually find someone to help me. This time those same people were of no help so I came here. We have an ordered pair $(a,b)$, okay? And if we wanted to show the world that ordered pair using set theory it would look like this: $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$. Yeah, I don't get that at all. As I've came to understand in the ordered pair order does matter. So how come it doesn't look like this when using set theory: $\{\{a\},\{b\}\}$? I know my question is probably retarded but this seems awfully confusing to me. How come the second coordinate can be either a or b? Logic makes me believe that my previous way of thinking can't be true and that I'm understanding it completely wrong. Can someone help me with this using simple language? Improvements: Now I understand why $\{\{a\},\{b\}\}$ doesn't apply. Thanks for the first step helpers.",['elementary-set-theory']
1575146,Multiple choice exercise on $f(x)= \frac {\sin x}{|x|+ \cos x}$,"Let $f : \Bbb R \to \Bbb R$ be the function defined by $f(x)= \frac {\sin x}{|x|+ \cos x}$ . Then A. $f$ is differentiable at all $x \in \Bbb R$ . B. $f$ is not differentiable at $x =0$ . C. $f$ is differentiable at $x=0$ but $f'$ is not continuous at $x=0$ . D. $f$ is not differentiable at $x=\frac {\pi}{2}$ . Using the standard definition of derivative, I get that $f$ is differentiable at $0$ as well as $\frac {\pi}2$ . This is as follows, $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac {f(0+h)-f(0)}{h}=1=\lim_{h \to 0} \frac {f(0-h)-f(0)}{-h}$ and $\lim_{h\to 0} \frac {f(\frac {\pi}2 +h)-f(\frac {\pi}{2})}{h}=0=\lim_{h \to 0} \frac {f(\frac {\pi}2 -h)-f(\frac {\pi}2)}{-h}$ using L'Hospital rule at one stage.

1575209,Distribution of monochromatic edge counts in 2-colored square lattices,"The question is how to compute in general the following: given integers $n$ and $k$, how many 2-colored $n \times n$ lattices have $k$ monochromatic edges. There are no diagonal edges. Observations : I noticed that when you do a plot of the distribution (normalized so that it's a probability distribution) for $n=10$, you get something which is approximately Gaussian in $k$. I thought that it might have some relationship with the Central Limit Theorem, which is used to explain why Gaussians show up in so many places. The CLT says that the probability distribution of the average of a large number of IID random variables is Gaussian. The random variables in this case act as indicators of whether an edge is monochromatic or not. This then suggests a binomial approximation where the Bernoulli trials correspond to checking if an edge is monochromatic or not. I tried this out and it works well. The insight from these approximations is that whether some edge is monochromatic or not is largely independent of other edges. Of course they actually are dependent so these approximations can't be perfect. I imagine, and I haven't had a chance to test this, that the graphs of log probabilities of the actual probability distribution and its binomial approximation diverge as you go along the tails. So can anyone give an exact formula?","['combinatorics', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"
1575213,Wave equation with angular variable,"Suppose that the variable of a mono-dimensional wave equation is an angle: $$\frac{\partial^2 f(\phi)}{\partial \phi^2} + k_{\phi}^2 f(\phi) = 0$$ This equation is derived from a more complex (and separable) equation in cylindrical coordinates and $\phi$ is one of these coordinates. According to the definition , $0 \leq \phi < 2\pi$. If I choose a cosinusoidal solution for $f(\phi)$, $k_{\phi}$ must be an integer. $$\cos (\omega t - k_{\phi}\phi), k_{\phi} \in \mathbb{Z}$$ Why? Let the time $t$ be fixed and $0$. I know that the $f(\phi)$ must have for $\phi \to 2 \pi^-$ the same behaviour as for $\phi \to 0^+$, so that the function appears to be ""continuous"" in that point. This is possible only when the period of the function is a submultiple of $2\pi$, so $k_{\phi} \in \mathbb{Z}$. But which could be a rigorous motivation for this? Should the function be continuous across $\phi = 2\pi$?

1575290,A misunderstanding concerning $\pi$,"The very well-known expression
$$\frac {\pi} {4} = 1 - \frac {1} {3} + \frac {1} {5} - \frac {1} {7} + \cdots$$

$$s_N = \sum_{k = 0}^{N} \frac {1} {4k + 1} - \sum_{k = 0}^{N} \frac {1} {4k + 3}.$$
Then it is obvious that
$$\frac {\pi} {4} = \lim_{N \to \infty} s_N.$$
By Euler-MacLaurin summation formula,
$$\sum_{k = 0}^{N} \frac {1} {4k + 1} = \int_{0}^{N} \frac {dx} {4x + 1} + \frac {1} {2} \left(1 + \frac {1} {4N + 1} \right) + o \left (\frac {1} {N^2} \right)$$

We then have
$$s_N = \frac {1} {4} \log \left(3 - \frac {6} {4N + 3} \right) + \frac {1} {3} + \frac {1} {(4N + 1) (4N + 3)} + o \left (\frac {1} {N^2} \right)$$

$$\lim_{N \to \infty} s_N = \frac {\log 3} {4} + \frac {1} {3}.$$

Indeed, any $k$ subsets $E_1 , \dots , E_k$ of $\mathbb{R}$ partition $\mathbb{R}$ into $2^k$ disjoint sets, each of which is an intersection of $E_i$ or the complement $\mathbb{R}\setminus E_i$ for $i = 1,\dots , k$ (and in particular, is measurable).

1575663,"What are general sets of conditions in which the inequality, $E\left(\frac{X}{Y}\right) \geq 1$ holds for positive r.v.'s $X$ and $Y$?","I am currently trying to determine what sorts of general conditions will allow the inequality, $E\left(\frac{X}{Y}\right) \geq 1$ to hold for positive r.v.'s $X$ and $Y$. One condition is to let $X$ and $Y$ be exchangeable, that is, the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$ is the same as the joint distribution of $(Y,X)$. However, I read in a book that an even more general condition than exchangeability holds. The hint given was to determine a concave function and to use Jensen's Inequality. One idea I had was to define the function $g(x,y) = \frac{x}{y}$. If this function is convex, then we have that: $$E\left(g(X,Y)\right) = E\left(\frac{X}{Y}\right) \geq g(E(X,Y)) = g(E(X), E(Y)) \geq \frac{E(X)}{E(Y)}$$ which then implies that the condition is the the means are equal. However, $g(x,y) = \frac{x}{y}$ is not convex and I am not able to think of another example that works.

1575805,20 balloons are distributed amongst 6 children: Probability that one child gets no balloon?,"20 balloons are randomly distributed amongst 6 children. What is the probability, that at least one child gets no balloon? What's the mistake in the following reasoning (I know there has to be a mistake; by simulation I know, that the actual probability has to be appr. 0.15, which is not what the following formula gives): I start to think about the opposite case: What is the probability that every child gets at least one balloon. There are all together ${20+6-1\choose 20} = {25\choose 20}$ ways to distribute the balloons amongst the children. The number of the desired ways (i.e. distribute balloons so that every child gets at least one balloon) is ${14+6-1\choose 14} = {19\choose 14}$. So, the probability that every child gets at least one balloon, when the balloons are randomly distributed amongst the children should be $$ \frac{19\choose 14}{25\choose 20}$$ For the opposite  case, i.e. the probability that at least one child gets no balloon is: 
$$ 1 - \frac{19\choose 14}{25\choose 20} = 0.78114...$$ At which point did I get wrong?? BTW: I used the following R-Code to simulate: v <- vector()
  for (i in 1:100000){
     t <- table(sample(1:6, 20, replace=T))
     v[i] <- length(t)<6
  }
  print mean(v) One Remark : The answer from mlu is in my opinion correct; thank you very much for it! However: My questions was, where my mistake is in the above reasoning? The number of different ways to distribute k indistinguishable balls (=balloons) into n distinguishable boxes (=children) is ${n+k-1\choose k}$. So: where did I actually got wrong, because the denominator as specified above is correct, right? So whats wrong about the counter? Solution Thank you very much, again, mlu, for the answer as a commentary below. Now I got it: I counted the number of partitions and tried to calculate the probability with the Laplace-Technique (the nominator for the total number of cases, and the counter for the number of cases we are interested in) but I missed, that not every partition is equally probable. For instance the partition where one child gets all balloons is much more improbable than the partition, that child1 to child4 gets 3 balloons and child5 and child6 get 4 balloons is much more probable, which is clear even by intuition: In the first case, there is always just one possibility to put the balloon whereas in the second case there are (at least at the beginning) many possibilities to put balloons.","['combinatorics', 'probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1575809,Correct Intepretation of Total Derivative,"My question is how should the total derivative (and functions in general) be interpreted in the multivariate case. I came up with two different ways and wish to know which is the agreed upon way. Let's say we have the following function of f(x(y), y): $$f(x(y), y)=x^2 + yx + y^2$$ x is a function of y following the relation: $$x=2y$$ Now, the there is no ambiguity for total derivative of y. It's simply the derivative of $(2y)^2+y(2y)+y^2$ with respect to y (alternatively the formula for total derivative can be used yielding the same result). The derivative equals $8y+4y+2y = 14y$ The total derivative of x on the other hand depends what we define the function sign to mean. If we define that x does not affect y, so that y is an independent variable (giving a not strict relationship for the above equation), then the total derivative reduces only to the direct effect x has on the function and is simply the partial derivative, giving: $$\large \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x} = 2x+y$$ However, this is might be the wrong interpretation. Since x is a function of y, then by y must also be a function of x, if the 2nd equation presented is interpreted as strict relationship (rather than as dependent/independent variable). Thus we can solve for $y = \frac{x}{2}$ and then the total derivative with respect to x can be obtained from $$4\large x^2+x(0.5x) + (0.5x)^2 \rightarrow \large 2x+x+0.5x= 3.5x$$ Which of these is the correct interpretation? Both of the relationships of course can hold, so the question becomes whether $f(x(y), (y))$ is even a possible function or should we write it as $f(x(y), y(x))$. Then we should use completely different notation involving sub variables for the case where x depends on y but the relationship does not swing the other way around giving for example $f(x(t,z), y(t))$.","['multivariable-calculus', 'functions']"
1575815,Contour integral of $\sqrt{z^{2}+a^{2}}$,"Suppose $a$ is real and nonnegative. Say we wanted to compute the above function (for whatever reason, be it to solve an improper real integral, or something else) along the curve $C$, as on the picture. I have chosen the contour as to avoid the branch cut connecting the three branch points. Supposing  $arg\left ( z \right ) \in \left [ 0,  2\pi \right )$ I also made parametrisations for each part of the contour. However, I wasn't able to do so for the parts  $C_{i}$, $i=1,2,3$. In several integrals like this and this one Ron talks about assigning a phase to the segments. To me it seems like he is assigning the phase  as if the branch point was now the origin of the plane, and the phase he added was relative to that point, am I right on this one? With that being said I would say that $$C2:  z=iye^{i\pi}$$
$$C3:  z=iye^{-i\pi}$$
$$C1:  z=iye^{i0}$$
However this doesn't look right as the argument wasn't defined for $\left [ -\pi,\pi \right )$. How do we deal with these branch cuts? And how to know what phase to add? Note that I have asked a similar question here for a different function, but I didn't receive satisfactory answers(due to my poor wording, I guess).","['complex-analysis', 'contour-integration', 'branch-cuts']"

1575851,Which functional space does feedforward neural network approximate?,"I'm pretty sure this question has already studied by at least one paper, but I can't figure out where. The question is the following : Given $l$ layers of $n_l \in L$ neurons, we can build a set of functions $\mathcal{N}(l, \{n_i | 1 \leq i \leq l\}\}$, which are the functions given by any neural feedforward neural network with this amount of layers and neuron (n_1 and n_l are respectively the input layers and output layers). Those functions are continuous $\mathcal{N}(l, n_i) \subset \mathcal{C}(R^n_1, R^n_l)$, and as the number of layers, or the number of neurons in a layer increase, we have bigger set of functions ($\mathcal{N}(l, n_i) \subset \mathcal{N}(l', m_i), \forall l \leq l', n_i \leq m_i$). But what kind of functions those $\mathcal{N}(l, n_i)$ (let's say n_0 and n_l are given and fixed) sets are approximating? I would be surprised if this set is dense in the set of continuous functions. I guess it is not the case, and then ask what is the smallest human-named set containing those functions. Are they dense in that set? If no, which functions are missing? Once we know that, what probability law does a uniform law on the weights ''induce'' on this function set? N.b. : This question is related to computer science, but since I'm looking for functional space, and probabilities, I thought it's better to ask on math exchange.

1575876,"The value of the rational ""Möbius""-like transformations at infinity","If $\mathbb F$ is some field, the group $PSL(2, \mathbb F)$ consists of the mappings
$$
 x \mapsto \frac{ax + b}{cx + d}
$$
with $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb F$ and $ad - bc = 1$. These mappings are defined over the extended field $\mathbb F_{\infty} := \mathbb F \cup \{\infty\}$ (or the so called projective line). As for example written on wikipedia:Möbius transformation we have $f(\infty) = \infty$ if $c = 0$. But I am asking myself what happens with $f(\infty)$ if $c \ne 0$? There is another way to view these mappings, consider $SL(2, \mathbb K)$, the group of matrices 
$$
 \begin{pmatrix} 
   a & b \\ c & d 
 \end{pmatrix}
$$
with $ad - bc = 1$. Then each such matrix could be mapped onto such a mapping as above, and this correspondence is surjective. By computation we find
$$
 \frac{a\left( \frac{a'x + b'}{c' + d'} \right) + d}{c\left( \frac{a'x + b'}{c' + d'}\right) + d}
 = \frac{(aa' + c'b)z + (ab' + bd')}{(ca' + dc')z + (cb' + d'd)}
$$
and of course
$$
 \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} 
 \begin{pmatrix} a' & b' \\ c' & d' \end{pmatrix}
 = \begin{pmatrix} aa' + bc' & ab' + bd' \\ a'c + dc' & cb' + dd'  
   \end{pmatrix}
$$
so this correspondence is a homomorphism. Such a mapping is the identity if $a = d, c = b = 0$, and the condition $ad = 1$ leaves the possiblities $a = b = \pm 1$, hence the kernel of this correspondence is
$$
 \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
 \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}.
$$
and this is precisely the center in the group $SL(2, \mathbb F)$. Hence $PSL(2, \mathbb F) \cong SL(2, \mathbb F) / Z(SL(2,\mathbb F))$. Now $SL(2, \mathbb F)$ acts on $\mathbb F^2$ in a natural way by matrix multiplication, hence we have an induced action of $PSL(2,\mathbb F)$ on $\mathbb F^2$. Now each $v = (x, y)^T\in \mathbb F^2$ could be identified with $(x/y, 1)^T$ if $y \ne 1$ and $(1,0)^T$ if $y = 0$, and by this we get an identification of $\mathbb F^2$ with $\mathbb F_{\infty}$ where $(1,0)^T$ corresponds to $\infty$. As
$$
 \begin{pmatrix}
   a & b \\ c & d 
 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ c \end{pmatrix}
$$
I guess we would have $f(\infty) = a/c$ if $c \ne 0$ (which corresponds to the projective point $(a,c)^T \equiv (a/c, 1)^T$).

Is this enough to show that $T$ is not a surjection? I am not entirely convinced. Clearly the only $g\in X$ for which this holds is $g=0$, the zero function in $X$.

The degree 2 polynomial is $x^2+x+1$.
The degree 3 polynomials are $x^3+x^2+1$ and $x^3+x+1$.
The degree 4 polynomials are $x^4+x+1$, $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$ and $x^4+x^3+1$. The binary Lyndon words are:
$a(1)=2=\#\{""0"",""1""\}$,
$a(2)=1=\#\{""01""\}$,
$a(3)=2=\#\{""001"",""011""\}$,
$a(4)=3=\#\{""0001"",""0011"",""0111""\}$ I would like to know if there is an easy correspondence between these objects or if there is some explanation as to why the formula counts the irreducible polynomial over $GF(2)$.","['finite-fields', 'galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'number-theory', 'combinatorics']"
1576082,"Probability - analyzing ""randomness"" of data","Forgive me, I am a probability novice and am looking for a little guidance. My question is based on real-world data. I have obscured it a bit for confidentiality reasons but the spirit of the question is the same. Okay, here is the setup: Suppose that 100 students from 37 different schools have applied to take part in a math camp. We are told that 188 students will be chosen randomly from the 3700 total applications. Suppose the following number of students are selected from each school: 7 8 1 5 11 3 6 15 3 7 43 1 1 2 1 23 4 3 5 5 6 2 16 1 1 2 (Schools 27-37 have 0 students selected) Now, I am suspicious about the large number of students chosen from School 11 (43 students), so I wish to analyze this data to determine the likelihood that the applications were randomly selected. Mathematically I believe this equates to determining whether or not the data follows a normal distribution. My attempt at the solution is the following. Since there are 37 different schools, and each school submitted the same number of applications, I would expect 188/37 ~ 5 students chosen from each school (i.e. this is the mean of my random variable). I would like to determine a range such that - if the students were randomly selected - ""there is a 99% probability that the number of students chosen from each school would be between x and y"" (so that I can see whether 43 falls into this range). However I am unsure what to use for the standard deviation. Thanks in advance for your help.","['statistics', 'probability']"

If $\{v_n\mid n\in\Bbb N\}$ are linearly independent and lie the unit sphere, the function $f(v_n)=n$ can be extended to a linear functional on $X$. It is unbounded and therefore not continuous.

If it is true, can you give me a reference? Thank you.","['reference-request', 'fiber-bundles', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"
1576526,"If a linear operator preserves positive functions, then it leaves some linear functional invariant","I have the following question which I cannot seem to make any progress on: Suppose that $T:C[0,1]\to C[0,1]$ is a linear operator satisfying that $Tf\geq 0$ whenever $f\geq 0$, and $T1=1$. Show that there exists a linear functional $\ell:C[0,1]$ satisfying $\ell(1)=1, \ell(f)\geq 0$ if $f\geq 0$ and $\ell(Tf)=\ell(f)$. My biggest issue is with the last condition, I just don't see how we know enough about $T$ to construct something that satisfies this. An obvious candidate would be $T^{-1}$ but how do we know that even exists or is well defined?","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"
1576580,Proving a theorem related to convex cone,"Let $V$ be a finite dimensional real Euclidean space. Let $C$ be a non-empty convex cone in $V$. I need to prove that the following are equivalent. int($C$) is non-empty. $C$ contains a basis of $V$. $C-C=V$. I have proved 1 implies 3 and 2 implies 3. I tried proving 3 implies 2 as follows. Let $C-C=V$. I need to prove that $C$ contains a basis of $V$. Suppose C doesn't contain a basis of V. Let $\{v_{1},...v_{r}\}$ be a maximal linearly independent set in $C$ where $r<n$=dim$V$. I know that $C-C$ is the smallest subspace of $V$ containing $C$. So if I can prove that $C \subset  span\{v_{1},...v_{r}\}$ which is a proper subspace of $V=C-C$, I will get a contradiction. But I'm not able to prove that $C \subset  span\{v_{1},...v_{r}\}$. Is my approach correct? Can someone help to prove it?! Also I need help to prove either 2 implies 1 or 3 implies 1.","['linear-algebra', 'analysis']"
1576588,"Prove without using graphing calculators that $f: \mathbb R\to \mathbb R,\,f(x)=x+\sin x$ is both one-to-one, onto (bijective) function.","Prove that the function $f:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ defined by $f(x)=x+\sin x$ for $x\in \mathbb R$ is a bijective function. The codomain of the $f(x)=x+\sin x$ is $\mathbb R$ and the range is also $\mathbb R$. So this function is an onto function. But I am confused in proving this function is one-to-one. I know about its graph and I know that if a function passes the  horizontal line test (i.e horizontal lines should not cut the function at more than one point), then it is a one-to-one function. The graph of this function looks like the graph of $y=x$ with sinusoids going along the $y=x$ line. If I use  a graphing calculator at hand, then I can tell that it is a one-to-one function and $f(x)=\frac{x}{2}+\sin x$ or $\frac{x}{3}+\sin x$ functions are not, but in the examination I need to prove this function is one-to-one theoritically, without graphing calculators. I tried the method which we generally use to prove a function is one-to-one but no success. Let $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ and we have to prove that $x_1=x_2$ in order fot the function  to be one-to-one. Let $x_1+\sin x_1=x_2+\sin x_2$ But I am stuck here and could not proceed further.","['real-analysis', 'calculus', 'functions']"

It is clear that $f$ is continuously differentiable but Inverse map theorem gives locally injectiveness of $f.$ How to show that $f$ is one one but not onto? For onto i think $(u,v)$ such that $u+v-1=0$ does not have pre image. Please help me. Thanks in advance.","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis', 'calculus']"
1576633,Distributing arbitrary union over arbitrary intersection (and vice versa),"Suppose $I, J$ are arbitrary index sets. Let $X$ be a set and $X_{i, j} \subseteq X$. I claim that
$$\bigcap_{i\in I} \bigcup_{j\in J} X_{i,j} = \bigcup_{(j_i) \in J^I}\: \bigcap_{i\in I} X_{i, j_i}.$$ $$\bigcup_{i\in I} \bigcap_{j\in J} X_{i,j} = \bigcap_{(j_i) \in J^I}\: \bigcup_{i\in I} X_{i, j_i}.$$ For the first result:
$\newcommand{\lra}{\longleftrightarrow}$
\begin{align*}
x \in \bigcap_{i\in I} \bigcup_{j\in J} X_{i,j} &\lra \forall i \in I\: \exists j \in J\: (x \in X_{i, j})\\
&\lra \exists (j_i) \in J^I \: \forall i \in I \: (x \in X_{i, j_i})\\
&\lra x \in \bigcup_{(j_i) \in J^I}\: \bigcap_{i\in I} X_{i, j_i}.
\end{align*} For the second result, we employ the first combined with De Morgan's laws: \begin{align*}
X - \bigcup_{i\in I} \bigcap_{j\in J} X_{i,j} &= \bigcap_{i\in I} \left[X-\bigcap_{j\in J} X_{i,j}\right]\\
&= \bigcap_{i\in I} \bigcup_{j\in J} (X - X_{i,j})\\
&= \bigcup_{(j_i) \in J^I}\: \bigcap_{i\in I} (X - X_{i,j_i})\\
&= \bigcup_{(j_i) \in J^I}\: \left[X - \bigcup_{i\in I} X_{i,j_i} \right]\\
&= X - \bigcap_{(j_i) \in J^I}\: \bigcup_{i\in I} X_{i,j_i}.
\end{align*} Is this result true, and is my proof valid? I couldn't find such a general result on Google (only stuff about finite unions/intersections), so I wanted to double check.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"
