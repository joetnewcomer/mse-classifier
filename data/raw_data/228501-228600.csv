I am not sure how to check $E[|Z_n|]< \infty $ either I am not sure if this makes a lot of sense: $ Q(\eta_{n+1})= \mathbb P \{\exists m  < \infty : \eta_m = 0 |\eta_0 = \eta_{n+1}\}$ then $n+1=0 $","['martingales', 'markov-chains', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

4729128,"Form of invariant measures for SDsE on the toroidal domain $[0,1)^d$","Consider the SDE $${\rm d}X_t=b(X_t){\rm d}t+\sigma(X_t){\rm d}W_t\tag1$$ with Lipschitz continous $b:\mathbb R^d\to\mathbb R^d,\sigma:\mathbb R^{d\times d}\to\mathbb R$ and a $d$ -dimensional Brownian motion $(W_t)_{t\ge0}$ . Now, let $$\iota:\mathbb R^d\to[0,1)^d\;,\;\;\;x\mapsto x-\lfloor x\rfloor,$$ where $\lfloor x\rfloor:=(\lfloor x_1\rfloor,\ldots,\lfloor x_d\rfloor)$ . Question : Can we prove existence of a solution to an SDE similar to $(1)$ , but evolving in $[0,1)^d$ (with toroidal wrap arround at the boundary) instead of $\mathbb R^d$ ? Would the correct formulation of that SDE be $$X_t=\iota\left(X_0+\int_0^tb(X_s)\:{\rm d}s+\int_0^t\sigma(X_s)\:{\rm d}W_s\right)\tag2?$$ If that's correct, does $(2)$ admit an invariant measure? My hope would be that existence of an invariant measure would be easier to verify here, since one problem in $\mathbb R^d$ is that ""all the probability mass could go to infinity""; which is not possible in $[0,1)^d$ with the wrap around. Can we also give an explicit form of (the density of) that measure? EDIT : Let me concretize my question: In my actual application, $b,\sigma$ are only defined on $[0,1)^d$ . I guess this is not a problem, since we can extend them periodically to $\mathbb R^d$ by $$b(x):=\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z^d}1_{[k,\:k+1)}(x)b(x-k)\tag3$$ and analogously for $\sigma$ . Next, I've also got a probability density $p:[0,1)^d\to[0,\infty)$ and would like to see how I need to choose $b$ and $\sigma$ such that the wrapped solution of the SDE has an invariant measure with density $p$ . The paper Langevin diffusions on the torus: estimation and applications is close to what I'm asking, but I don't really understand why Proposition 1 holds (asked for that here ) and it is somehow different in the treatment of $p$ .","['measure-theory', 'stochastic-analysis', 'stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-differential-equations', 'probability-theory']"
4729181,Proving that quotient of orthogonal polynomials is a PadÃ© approximant of Stieltjes transform.,"Conext and notation. In the question below, $R_n(z) / S_n(z)$ denotes the n-th convergent of the continued fraction $$ \frac{1|}{|z-b_1} + \frac{-a_2|}{|z-b_2} + \dots + \frac{-a_n|}{|z-b_n} + \dots,$$ where $a_n,b_n$ are the coefficients of a generic orthogonal sequence of monic polynomials $\{p_n(z)\}$ that satisfies the three term recurrence relation $$ p_n(z) = (z-b_n)p_{n-1}(z) - a_np_{n-2}(z), \quad \text{ for } \, \, n= 1,2,\dots$$ The problem. Define the function $$ \hat w(z) = \int_a^b \frac{1}{z-t}w(t) dt,$$ which is normally known as the Stieltjes transformation. I wish to prove that \begin{equation} \tag{1} \hat w(z) - \frac{R_n(z)}{S_n(z)} = \frac{1}{p_n(z)}\int_a^b \frac{p_n(t)}{z-t}w(t) \, dt.\end{equation} and \begin{equation} \tag{2} \hat w(z) - \frac{R_n(z)}{S_n(z)} = \frac{k_n^1}{z^{2n+1}} + \frac{k_n^2}{z^{2n+2}} + \dots, \quad |z| > R,\end{equation} where $R$ is big enough to guarantee uniform convergence of the series $\displaystyle{\sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac{t^j}{z^{j+1}}}.$ My attempt. I was able to prove $(1)$ with ease. Identity $(2)$ gave me quite some more problems. Follows my attempt: We have that \begin{equation*}
 \begin{split}
 \hat w(z) - \frac{R_n(z)}{S_n(z)} &= \frac{1}{p_n(z)} \int_a^b
 \frac{p_n(t)}{z-t}w(t) \, dt \\[.25cm]
&= \frac{1}{p_n(z)} \int_a^b \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac{t^j}{z^{j+1}}p_n(t) w(t) \, dt \\[.25cm]
&= \frac{1}{p_n(z)} \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac{1}{z^{j+1}} \boxed{\int_a^b t^j p_n(t) w(t) \, dt}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*} So, all we have to do is study the boxed integral above. From the theory of orthogonal polynomials, we know that for $j<n$ this integral is zero and for $j=n$ we have that $$ \int_a^b t^np_n(t) w(t) \, dt = \gamma_n h_n, $$ where $\displaystyle{h_n = \int_a^b p_n^2(t)w(t) \, dt}$ and $\gamma_n$ is such that $\displaystyle{t^n = \sum_{i=0}^n \gamma_i p_i(t)}$ (recall that $\{p_0(t),\dots,p_n(t)\}$ forms a basis for the vectorial space of the polynomials in one variable of degree equal or smaller than $n$ ). So everything we have to do is to study the boxed integral for values of $j$ such that $j > n.$ For this cases, it is clear that $\{ p_0(t),\dots,p_j(t)\}$ forms a basis for the vectorial space of the polynomials in one variable of degree equal or smaller than $j$ . Therefore, we can find scalars $\delta_i$ such that $$ t^j = \sum_{i=0}^j \delta_i p_i(t). $$ Then, $$ \int_a^b t^j p_n(t) w(t) \, dt = \sum_{i=0}^j \delta_i \int_a^b p_i(t)p_n(t) w(t) \, dt = \delta_n h_n. $$ Therefore, we have that $$ \hat w(z) - \frac{R_n(z)}{S_n(z)} = \frac{1}{p_n(z)}\left[ \frac{\gamma_n h_n}{z^{n+1}} + \sum_{j=n+1}^\infty \frac{\delta_n h_n}{z^{j+1}} \right].$$ Thanks for any help in advance.","['stieltjes-integral', 'real-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'orthogonal-polynomials', 'continued-fractions']"
4729241,Show that $ \left\{ \sum_{k=0}^\infty(-1)^{k+1}\frac{2^{2k}-1}{2^{2k-1}}\zeta(2k) \right\}=\frac{\pi}{2}\tanh\frac{\pi}{2}-1 $,"I want to prove the following: $$ \left\{ \sum_{k=0}^\infty(-1)^{k+1}\frac{2^{2k}-1}{2^{2k-1}}\zeta(2k) \right\}=\frac{\pi}{2}\tanh\frac{\pi}{2}-1 $$ where $ \{ x \} $ is the fractional part of $x$ . In fact, this is an abuse of notation, since actually the series doesn't converge. What it does is oscillate between two values that are exactly an integer apart (as you can see here ), so they have the same fractional part, hence the notation. It would have been more correct to write: $$\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\left\{\sum_{k=0}^N(-1)^{k+1}\frac{2^{2k}-1}{2^{2k-1}}\zeta(2k) \right\}=\frac{\pi}{2}\tanh\frac{\pi}{2}-1$$ However, I attacked the problem in several ways, including: using $\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^s}$ and then exchanging the order of summation we get: $$\sum_{k=0}^N(-1)^{k+1}\frac{2^{2k}-1}{2^{2k-1}}\zeta(2k)=\sum_{k=0}^N(-1)^{k+1}\frac{2^{2k}-1}{2^{2k-1}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^{2k}}=$$ $$=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sum_{k=0}^N(-1)^{k+1}\frac{2^{2k}-1}{2^{2k-1}}\frac{1}{n^{2k}}$$ which doesn't seem much easier. using $\zeta(2s)=\frac{(-1)^{s+1}B_{2s}(2\pi)^{2s}}{2(2n)!}$ : $$\sum_{k=0}^N(-1)^{k+1}\frac{2^{2k}-1}{2^{2k-1}}\zeta(2k)=\sum_{k=0}^N\frac{(2^{2k}-1)B_{2k}\pi^{2k}}{(2k)!}$$ but I don't recognise this to be a known sum with Bernoulli numbers. Plus notice the fact that $$\frac{\pi}{2}\tanh\frac{\pi}{2}=\frac{i}{2}\left[\psi\left(\frac{1-i}{2}\right)- \psi\left(\frac{1+i}{2}\right) \right]$$ which didn't help me at all but perhaps it can be useful. The real problems are that all these sums are not converging, but rather oscillating, and it's not clear how and when to use the fractional part to get the desired result. Maybe using some integral representation of the zeta function? Any ideas?","['integration', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'sequences-and-series']"

4729361,$\alpha$-quantum wedge in Liouville Quantum Gravity,"We consider a proper simply connected subdomain $D\subset\mathbb{C}$ and let $\overline{\mathcal{D}}(D)$ be the space of smooth functions in $D$ with finite Dirichlet energy, which we consider modulo constants. The closure of $\overline{\mathcal{D}}(D)$ with respect to the Dirichlet inner product $$\langle f,g\rangle_\nabla:=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_D\nabla f\cdot\nabla g$$ will be denoted by $\overline{H}^1(D)$ . Let $\{\overline{f}_j\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$ be an orthonormal basis for $\overline{H}^1(D)$ and let $\{X_j\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$ be independent $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ random variables. The random series $$\overline{h}_n:=\sum_{j\in\mathbb{N}}X_j\overline{f}_j$$ converges almost surely in the space of distributions modulo constants, and the law of the limit does not depend on the choice of orthonormal basis $\{\overline{f}_j\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$ . The Neumann Gaussian free field (NGFF) is defined to be the limit $h$ of this random series. Let $S=\mathbb{R}\times(0,\pi)$ be an infinite strip. We can decompose $\overline{H}^1(S)$ as follows: Let $\overline{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{rad}}$ be the subspace of $\overline{H}^1(S)$ obtained by closing the smooth functions which are constant on each vertical segment, modulo constants and let $\mathcal{H}_{\text{circ}}$ be the subspace obtained by closing off the smooth functions which have mean zero on all vertical segments. We have that $$\overline{H}^1(S)=\overline{\mathcal{H}}_{\text{rad}}\oplus\mathcal{H}_{\text{circ}}.$$ This allows us to write the NGFF on $S$ as $h=h_{\text{rad}}^{\text{GFF}}+h_{\text{circ}}^{\text{GFF}}$ , where $h_{\text{rad}}^{\text{GFF}},h_{\text{circ}}^{\text{GFF}}$ are independent, $h_{\text{rad}}^{\text{GFF}}(z)=B_{2s}$ if $\text{Re}(z)=s$ , where $B$ is an independent standard Brownian motion modulo constants, and $h_{\text{circ}}^{\text{GFF}}(z)$ has mean zero on each vertical segment. Now let $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$ be the space of signed Radon measures $\rho$ on $S$ with finite and equal positive and negative mass, so that $\int_D\rho(dx)=0$ , such that $$\overline{f}\mapsto\int_D\overline{f}(x)\rho(dx)$$ defines a continuous linear functional on $\overline{H}^1(S)$ . We define $$\mathcal{M}:=\{\rho:\rho=\tilde{\rho}+f\text{ with }\tilde{\rho}\in\tilde{\mathcal{M}}\text{ and }f\in\mathcal{D}_0(S)\},$$ where $\mathcal{D}_0(S)$ is the space of smooth test functions that are compactly supported in $S$ . An $\alpha$ -quantum wedge is defined as follows: Let $$h_{\text{rad}}=\begin{cases}B_{2s}+(\alpha+Q),&\text{if Re}(z)=\text{ and }s\geq0;\\\widehat{B}_{-2s}+(\alpha-Q)s,&\text{if Re}(z)=s\text{ and }s<0,\end{cases}$$ where $B$ is a standard Brownian motion, and $\widehat{B}$ is an independent Brownian motion conditioned so that $\widehat{B}_{2t}+(Q-\alpha)t>0$ for all $t>0$ and $Q$ is just a constant $Q=\frac{2}{\gamma}+\frac{\gamma}{2}$ and $\gamma\in[0,2)$ . Let $h_{\text{circ}}$ be a stochastic process indexed by $\mathcal{M}$ that is independent of $h_{\text{rad}}$ and has the same law as $h_{\text{circ}}^{\text{GFF}}$ . We call $h=h_{\text{rad}}+h_{\text{circ}}$ an $\alpha$ -quantum wedge in $S$ . Can someone help me understand why the $\alpha$ -quantum wedge is important for LQG? To my eyes the definition includes a lot of formalities that don't necessarily form a good picture or vision in my head. Why is this construction necessary/useful? Edit: I want to explain why this is a math question, and not a physics question, since I've been asked. Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) is a ""poorly"" named field of math. It was inspired by Polyakov's 1984 seminal work The Quantum Geometry of Bosonic Strings . From that paper blossomed the field of Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT), a 2D theory of quantum gravity. When physicists first tried to solve LCFT, they did so through a nonrigorous analytic continuation argument, from which they found the DOZZ formula -- A sort of good guess. When mathematicians came to tackle the problem (just like how the Feynman path integral is formalized by Brownian bridges), they discovered that a two dimension version of the Brownian bridge, called the Gaussian free field (GFF), was involved. Now, LQG has branched off significantly from LCFT: The rigorous proof of the DOZZ formula was recently completed, and the next goal is to work on the conformal bootstrap (this is work in LCFT; I'll be publishing notes soon on the rigorous proof of the DOZZ formula, since it takes hundreds of pages across multiple papers and books). LQG on the other hand, focuses more on the random geometry. We consider things like random models on graphs, and discover that their scaling limits are Liouville quantum gravity surfaces, explicitly construct a random metrics, and as you saw above, notions of GFF, etc. This is only the tip of the iceberg for LQG, which has deep connections to imaginary geometry, SLE and other random processes, etc., and even the motivating LCFT.","['analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'stochastic-processes', 'brownian-motion', 'probability-theory']"
4729384,"Let $T: \mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\{0\}\cup X, X$ is a finite set. Only a finite number of integers are not sent to $0$.

4729441,Can the Stinespring Dilation Theorem extend to *unbounded* operators?,"I have some (possibly basic) questions about $C^*$ -algebras, the Stinespring Theorem (Theorem 3.6 in Takesaki's book ), and unbounded operators. This is motivated by quantum mechanics, where unbounded operators are common. For example, the momentum operator $\hat{p}$ (which is related to $-i \partial^{\,}_x$ ), or the boson number operator $\hat{n}$ , whose eigenvalues are $n \in \mathbb{N}^{\,}_0$ . For reference, I have come across these two works from 2008 and from 2020 , which seem relevant, though I lack the background to understand them fully in finite time. Do the two references above generically extend the Stinespring Theorem to unbounded operators? In other words, if a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ admits unbounded operators, and I replace the usual set of bounded operators $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ with the set  End( $\mathcal{H}$ ) of all (possibly self-adjoint) linear operators on $\mathcal{H}$ , does the following aspect of the Stinespring Theorem still hold: Let $\mathcal{H}$ and $\mathcal{K}$ be Hilbert spaces, with corresponding operator sets ${\rm End}(\mathcal{H})$ and ${\rm End}(\mathcal{K})$ . If the adjoint map $\psi^* = \phi: \mathcal{A} \to {\rm End}(\mathcal{H})$ is completely positive and unital, then there exists a unital *-homomorphism $\pi : \mathcal{A} \to {\rm End} (\mathcal{K})$ and an isometry $V : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{K}$ such that, $ \forall A \in \mathcal{A}$ , $\phi (A) = V^* \pi (A) V$ , up to multiplication by a unitary. The statement above is the part of the Theorem relevant to me, and please correct me if I've been sloppy. For quantum mechanics, the $C^*$ -algebra $\mathcal{A}$ is unital, the map $\psi$ and its adjoint $\phi$ are generally completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP), we can restrict to self-adjoint operators in End( $\mathcal{H}$ ), and/or require that dim( $\mathcal{K}$ ) â¥ dim( $\mathcal{H}$ ), if helpful. If these papers are not familiarâand because I am new to *-algebrasâit would also be helpful to me to know, e.g., what goes wrong in trying to construct $C^*$ -algebras with unbounded operators, if anything? If there are issues, do they persist if we restrict to unital algebras / CPTP maps / self-adjoint operators? Or, are things like ""completely positive"" or other aspects of $C^*$ -algebras difficult to define with unbounded operators? Lastly, do unbounded operators pose a particular obstacle to proving the Stinespring Theorem beyond the considerations above? If this is a bad question in any respect, please let me know how I could improve it / what is missing. I did not find any similar questions while searching Stack, and my more general search came up with the two papers referenced above.

4729448,Difference Between Riemann Integrals and Definite Integrals,"I'm currently using a textbook that covers Calculus and Analytic Geometry, however, the author seems to have confused me with notations and definitions. He first proves that the area under the curve within the interval $[a,b]$ can be calculated by allowing $n$ to approach infinity in $\Sigma_{k = 1}^ n f(c_k) \Delta x$ , ... (1) where $c_k$ is the minimum of the function at the $k$ th interval, and $\Delta x$ is the length of each interval (so that $\Delta x = \frac{b â a}{n}$ ). He first defines (1) to be the ""Area under the graph"". Later in the text, he calls (1) specifically the ""lower bound"", because it approaches the actual graph from below. And so $\Sigma_{k = 1}^ n f(c_k) \Delta x$ , where $c_k$ is the maximum of the function at the $k$ th interval is called the ""upper bound"", because it approaches the actual graph from below. A question arises for me: although the upper bound and lower bound are equal as $n$ approaches infinity, is the notion of ""Area under the graph"" specifically defined as the lower bound? However, this question is only subsidiary to my next. Later, the author begins considering arbitrary intervals instead of fixed ones. He defines the ""norm"" to be the length of the greatest interval. He proves that $\Sigma_{k = 1}^ n f(c_k) \Delta x_k$ , (where $c_k$ is a randomly chosen point in the interval $\Delta x_k$ ) is equal to the upper and lower bound as the norm approaches $0$ . He calls this expression the Riemann Integral (named adter Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann), and denotes it by $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ . He then says that the area we defined earlier in (1) is the Riemann Integral over the interval $[a,b]$ . He then says that the Integral $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ is called the Definite Integral. I was completely thrown off. So are the ""area under the graph"", the Riemann Integral, the Definite Integral all identical concepts? Is there a difference between the terminologies?

I have consider using Lebesgue-dominated convergence theorem by letting $\{t_n\}\subset \mathbb{R} - \{0\}$ so that $t_n \to 0$ and defining $$I_n(t) := \int_a^b \frac{|f(x) + t_n g(x)|^p - |f(x)|^p}{t_n}\, dx$$ however I am not too sure how to carry on from here. Alternatively, I suspect the derivative at $t = 0$ should be the following expression $$A := \int_a^b p  |f(x)|^{p-1} |g(x)| \, dx$$ so i tried to consider proving the following $$\lim_{t \to 0} \int_a^b \frac{|f(x) + t g(x)|^p - pt |f(x)|^{p-1}|g(x)| - |f(x)|}{t}\, dx = 0.$$ However, I am not sure of any inequalities to estimate the integrand.

4729755,"Topology, Normal Spaces - Proving a function is continuous knowing that any composition is continuous.","my question is regarding topology. Given two topological spaces $X, Y$ and we know that $Y$ is $T_4$ . Let $f:X \rightarrow Y$ be a function such that for any continuous function $\phi:Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , the composition $\phi \circ f$ is continuous . Show that $f$ it self is continuous.

If we could find a function $g$ such that $g:Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ would be zero in exactly $Y \setminus V$ and positive else where, then we could take the preimage of the open set $(0,\infty)$ which would be open in $X$ and be exactly $f^{-1}[V]$ . As I looked around, it seems we can build such a function when knowing that a set is $G_{\delta}$ , and the space is normal but here we don't know that the set is $G_{\delta}$ .

We say that a binary operation $f \, \colon S \times S \to S$ is a choice operation if it always returns one of its arguments. In other words, $\forall \, a \in S \, \colon f(a,a)=a$ and $\forall \, a, b \in S, \, a \ne b \, \colon f(a,b) \in \{ a, b \}$ . If $f$ is associative , it defines a semigroup on $S$ . We'll use more simple and common to semigroups notation $a \cdot b$ instead of $f(a,b)$ further. Several notable (and, in some sense, exhaustive) examples of such operations are $a \cdot b \equiv \max (a,b)$ , $a \cdot b \equiv \min (a,b)$ on some totally ordered set and $a \cdot b \equiv a$ ( ""leftArg"" ), $a \cdot b \equiv b$ ( ""rightArg"" ) on any set. The first two are commutative, while the last two are not. How to describe all semigroups $(S, \, \cdot)$ based on a choice operation? It is not hard to prove that such semigroup is commutative if and only if there is a total order on $S$ such that $a \cdot b \equiv \max (a,b)$ (or, alternatively, $a \cdot b \equiv \min (a,b)$ for the reverse order). That's why I've said that $\max (a,b)$ is exhaustive. What about non-commutative semigroups? My conjecture is that $(S, \, \cdot)$ is a semigroup with a choice operation $\cdot$ if and only if there exist a totally ordered set $(T, \, \leq)$ and two functions $r \, \colon S \to T$ (rank) and $s \, \colon T \to \{\mathcal L, \mathcal R\}$ (side) such that $\cdot$ is a combination of the above max, leftArg and rightArg functions in the following sense: $$ a \cdot b \equiv

4729926,Prove the (path-) connectedness of the graph of a compact- and convex-valued upper hemi-continuous correspondence.,"Let $\Gamma: [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a compact- and convex-valued, upper hemi-continuous correspondence. Prove that the graph of $\Gamma$ is a connected set. Is it path-connected? This is what I have so far: Proof $\space$ We first show that $Gr(\Gamma)$ is connected. Assume to the contrary that $Gr(\Gamma)$ is not connected. Then $Gr(\Gamma) = A \cup B$ where $\overline{A} \cap B = \phi$ and $A \cap \overline{B} = \phi$ , $A \neq \phi$ , and $B \neq \phi$ . Since $\Gamma$ is compact- and convex-valued, $\Gamma(x)$ us a closed interval or a singleton for all $x \in [0, 1]$ . Since $\Gamma$ is upper hemi-continuous, $Gr(\Gamma)$ is closed. Let $(x, y)$ be a limit point of $Gr(\Gamma)$ . Without loss of generality, assume $(x, y) \in A$ , where $y \in \Gamma(x)$ . Then $(x, y) \notin \overline{B}$ . Take a sequence $\{x_n\}$ such that $x_n \to x$ . Then there exists a subsequence ${x_{n_k}}$ such that $(x_{n_k}, y_{n_k}) \in \overline{B}$ , $y_{n_k} \in \Gamma(x_{n_k})$ , and $x_{n_k} \to x$ . However, no subsequence of $\{y_{n_k}\}$ can converge to $y$ , for otherwise $(x, y)$ would be in $\overline{B}$ . This contradicts the sequential characterization of upper hemi-continuous correspondence. Therefore, $Gr(\Gamma)$ is connected. I would really appreciate it if someone could check if my proof of the connectedness is correct. In addition, I have difficulties to determine whether $Gr(\Gamma)$ is path-connected or not. I tried to use the $Gr(\Gamma)$ = Deleted Comb Space as a counterexample, but it turns out that $Gr(\Gamma)$ is not closed, because its closure is the Comb Space. By the closed-graph theorem, if $\Gamma$ is upper hemi-continuous, $Gr(\Gamma)$ would be closed. Hence $\Gamma$ is not upper hemi-continuous, a contradiction. This is a question about set-valued analysis and topological spaces . I would like to provide some related definitions and results first, because they are usually not covered in a standard math course in analysis or topology: Definition $\space$ Let $X$ and $Y$ be two sets. If with each element $x$ of $X$ we associate a subset $\Gamma(x)$ of $Y$ , we say that the correspondence $x \to \Gamma(x)$ is a mapping of $X$ into $Y$ ; the set $\Gamma(x)$ is called the image of $x$ under the mapping $\Gamma$ . Definition $\space$ Let $\Gamma$ be a mapping of a topological space $X$ into a topological space $Y$ , and let $x_0$ be any point of $X$ . We say that $\Gamma$ is lower hemi-continuous at $x_0$ if for each open set $G$ meeting $\Gamma(x_0)$ , there is a neighborhood $U(x_0)$ such that \begin{equation}
x \in U(x_0) \Longrightarrow \Gamma(x) \cap G \neq \phi.
\end{equation} We say that $\Gamma$ is upper hemi-continuous at $x_0$ if for each open set $G$ containing $\Gamma(x_0)$ there exists a neighborhood $U(x_0)$ such that \begin{equation}
x \in U(x_0) \Longrightarrow \Gamma(x) \subset G.
\end{equation} We say that the mapping $\Gamma$ is continuous at $x_0$ if it is both lower and upper hemi-continuous at $x_0$ . Definition $\space$ We say that $\Gamma$ is lower hemi-continuous in $X$ (l.h.c. in $X$ ) if it is lower hemi-continuous at each point of $X$ . We say that $\Gamma$ is upper hemi-continuous in $X$ (u.h.c. in $X$ ) if it is upper hemi-continuous at each point of $X$ and if, also, $\Gamma(x)$ is a compact set for each $x$ . If $\Gamma$ is both lower hemi-continuous in $X$ and upper hemi-continuous in $X$ , then it will be called continuous in $X$ . Definition $\space$ The correspondence $\Gamma$ is closed-valued if for each $x \in X$ , $\Gamma(x)$ is closed in $Y$ . Definition $\space$ The correspondence $\Gamma$ is compact-valued if for each $x \in X$ , $\Gamma(x)$ is compact in $Y$ . Definition $\space$ The correspondence $\Gamma$ is convex-valued if for each $x \in X$ , $\Gamma(x)$ is a convex set in $Y$ . Definition $\space$ The graph of the correspondence $\Gamma$ is the set $Gr(\Gamma) = \{(x, y) \in X \times Y | y \in \Gamma(x)\}$ . Lemma $\space$ [Sequential characterization of lower hemi-continuous] A correspondence $\Gamma: X \to Y$ is lower hemi-continuous at $x_0 \in X$ if and only if, for any sequence $\{x_m\}$ converges to $x_0$ and any $y \in \Gamma(x_0)$ , there exists a sequence $\{y_m\}$ converges to $y$ such that $y_m \in \Gamma(x_m)$ for all $x_m$ . Lemma $\space$ [Sequential characterization of upper hemi-continuous] Let $\Gamma: X \to Y$ be a correspondence. If, for every sequence $\{x_m\}$ in $X$ that converges to $x_0 \in X$ and for every sequence $\{y_m\}$ such that $y_m \in \Gamma(x_m)$ , there exists a subsequence of $\{y_m\}$ that converges to a point in $\Gamma(x_0)$ , then $\Gamma$ is upper hemi-continuous at $x_0$ . If $\Gamma$ is compact-valued, then the converse is true. Theorem $\space$ [Closed graph theorem] Let $\Gamma: X \to Y$ be a correspondence.

4730104,Is Schwartz space canonical in any sense?,"Schwartz space $\mathcal S(\mathbb R^n, \mathbb C)$ is a dense subspace of $L^2(\mathbb R^n,\mathbb C)$ that appears frequently in physics, because the position operators $X_i$ and momentum operators $P_i$ , defined by $(X_if)(x) = x_if(x)$ and $P_if=-i (\partial/\partial x_i)f$ are defined and well behaved on it. However, there are many other spaces of test functions that could be used (and sometimes are used) in this context, and elsewhere in functional analysis. Still the Schwartz functions seem to appear the most often, so I wonder if they are ""natural"" or ""canonical"" in any sense.

\varepsilon^{-1} (\vartheta_\varepsilon^*-\vartheta_0)=\Delta_\varepsilon +   \frac{\bar{\vartheta}_{\tau_\varepsilon}-\vartheta_0}{\varepsilon} R_\varepsilon^*

\sup_{\vartheta_0 \in \mathbb{K}}\mathbb{E}_{\vartheta_0} \left| \frac{\bar{\vartheta}_{\tau_\varepsilon}-\vartheta_0}{\varepsilon} R_\varepsilon^* \right|^p \underset{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0}{\longrightarrow} 0

In particular we have $(1+x)^n< 1 + (n+1) x$ for $x> 0$ small enough.  How small is just the question.  I have approximated the logs on both sides with their quadratic terms and got $x_n\simeq \frac{2}{n^2+n+1}$ for the solution of the equation $$(1+x_n)^n = 1+(n+1) x_n$$ Now it turns out that we  have $$x_n > \frac{2}{n^2}$$ equivalently $$\left(1+\frac{2}{n^2}\right)^n < 1+\frac{2(n+1)}{n^2}$$ This is not hard to show with some calculus ( take the second derivative). I am   interested in better estimates for $x_n$ defined above. I am thinking about large $n$ 's Any feedback would be appreciated! Got some great feedback. @Somos solution finds it as a power series in $\frac{1}{n}$ .  It seems that all of the coefficients are positive.  I wonder how one could prove that.
Also @Somos expressed the problem as an inversion of a function. In @Claude Leibovici solution it seems we find the Pade approximants.  They themselves have expansion in $\frac{1}{n}$ with positive coefficients it seems.  Intriguing. This is still evolving.  The way I see it now: Let $t = \frac{1}{n}$ , $t$ small.  Also take $k$ a parameter ( assumed positive). The equation in $x$ with parameters $k$ and $t$ $$(1+ x)^{\frac{1}{t}} - (1 + (\frac{1}{t} + k) x)$$ has a solution for $x$ that is approximately $2 k t^2$ .  So write $x = 2 k t^2 \cdot y$ and consider the equation in $y$ $$\frac{ \log( 1+ 2 k t^2 y) - t \log (1 + (\frac{1}{t} + k) 2 k t^2 y)}{t^3} =0$$ or $f(k,t,y) = 0$ .  In this setup $f$ is analytic (in $k$ , $t$ , $y$ ), $f(k, 0, 1) = 0$ , and moreover, $\frac{\partial f(k,0,1)}{\partial y} = 2 k^2 \ne 0$ (if $k\ne 0$ ).  So now we  get a solution $$x= x(t) = 2 k t^2[ 1+ \frac{1}{3}( 3 - 2k)t + \frac{1}{9} ( 9+ 5 k^2) + \frac{1}{135}( 135 + 90 k - 30 k^2 - 68 k^3)t^3 + \cdots ]$$ This series is convergent for small $t$ . For $k=1$ ( the original problem) it seems the coefficients are positive, still not elucidated. With calculus ( using the known series expansion of @Somos) we could show that $$x(t) = x(1,t) > 2 t^2( 1 + 1/3 t + 14
/9 t^2)$$ by showing that $$f(t) \colon = t \log ( 1+ (\frac{1}{t} + 1)2 t^2( 1 + 1/3 t + 14/9 t^2)) - \log ( 1 + 2 t^2( 1 + 1/3 t + 14/9 t^2))>0$$ For this, check that $f(0) = f'(0) = 0$ , and $f''(t) > 0$ for $t> 0$ ( see this WA link )","['calculus', 'asymptotics', 'inequality']"

I'm pretty sure this is true for Riesz spaces and am wondering if it holds more generally. If the above holds with additional conditions (complete, complemented, distributive, etc) that would also be interesting.

Update: As an attempt, I've been trying to start with an arbitrary path $\gamma(t)$ and using completeness to construct another path $ \bar \gamma(t) = sup_{t' \leq t} \gamma(t') $ . But there's no reason to believe that the new $\bar \gamma$ is a continuous path in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . It also seems that a necessary condition to this problem is that we can find an uncountably infinite chain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ .

But is it always true for any continuous meet and join operations? Update 2: I've dug up the following result from ""A Compendium of Continuous Lattices"" (Gierz et. al.) which is close: Unfortunately the results in this text rely heavily on compactness. But the result is also stronger than required: it shows that there's an arc-chain (the correct terminology for the above) between any $x < y$ , while I'm only looking for the existence of any arc-chain.

4730468,Is state space representation useful for nonlinear control systems?,"I understand that the state space representation is mathematically equivalent to the transfer function representation for linear systems, and that it allows us to solve the corresponding DE by finding the eigenvalues of a matrix.

But what's the advantage of using state space form for nonlinear systems, if we can't generally solve them by matrix methods? How does state space representation help us analyze or design nonlinear control systems any better than we could by sticking with the original DE representation? Some background: My impression was that the state space form of linear systems is essentially just syntactic sugar for the final result of transforming a nth order DE into a system of n first order DE's, and writing that system as a single matrix equation. It ""hides"" the derivatives under the extra parameterization variables. But for nonlinear systems, we can't just get a system of linear equations and write it as a single matrix equation that doesn't explicitly involve derivatives.

{
\frac{{\mathrm{d}}^{2}u}{{\mathrm{d}z}^{2}}+\left[2(A+B)-2B   sn^{2}(z,1)\right] u(z)=0

These starting distances are denoted as $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ for probes $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ , respectively. For a clearer representation, please refer to the revised diagram below (figure 2): The following variables are known : $a$ , $b$ , $c$ - the distances measured by the 3 probes $\theta$ - the probe mounting angle around the center of the    measuring bung $D$ - the bore diameter of the master part The following variables are unknown : $r_a$ , $r_b$ , $r_c$ - the probe mounting distances from the center ofthe measuring bung Objective: The objective is to find $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ . These distances will be determined during the calibration process (using the master part). Once these distances are determined, the master part can be replaced with a new part having an unknown diameter, such that the diameter of any part can be accurately measured. Measurement Process: The calibration process involves taking any number of measurements $(K)$ with the tooling seated in various configurations. Each time, the tooling was seated in a new position. Using CAD software, I can determine the probe measurements ( $a_k, b_k, c_k$ ) for each measurement $(K)$ . $D = 25.0;$ $R = 12.5;$ $Î¸ = 120^\circ;$ $K=01 :\qquad   a_{01} = 5.2491254 ;\quad  b_{01} = 3.6421203 ;\quad  c_{01} = 5.5479800 ;$ $K=02 :\qquad   a_{02} = 3.5261623 ;\quad  b_{02} = 4.0069957 ;\quad  c_{02} = 6.9097135 ;$ $K=03 :\qquad   a_{03} = 5.2425714 ;\quad  b_{03} = 2.2366199 ;\quad  c_{03} = 6.9231890 ;$ $K=04 :\qquad   a_{04} = 5.6053228 ;\quad  b_{04} = 4.0762025 ;\quad  c_{04} = 4.5958384 ;$ $K=05 :\qquad   a_{05} = 2.6211544 ;\quad  b_{05} = 4.3330685 ;\quad  c_{05} = 7.3330685 ;$ $K=06 :\qquad   a_{06} = 5.6305936 ;\quad  b_{06} = 1.7881182 ;\quad  c_{06} = 6.8966301 ;$ $K=07 :\qquad   a_{07} = 3.1218340 ;\quad  b_{07} = 5.3989306 ;\quad  c_{07} = 5.7511286 ;$ $K=08 :\qquad   a_{08} = 2.8136425 ;\quad  b_{08} = 3.7336225 ;\quad  c_{08} = 7.7652347 ;$ $K=09 :\qquad   a_{09} = 6.7312779 ;\quad  b_{09} = 1.6301678 ;\quad  c_{09} = 5.7985227 ;$ $K=10 :\qquad  a_{10} = 3.7744161 ;\quad  b_{10} = 5.6724511 ;\quad  c_{10} = 4.7375570 ;$ Find $r_a; r_b;r_c;$ (Prove that $r_a = 8;r_b = 9;r_c = 6;$ for this example) Solution based on answers from Fedja This is my understanding on the solution provided by Fedja... from the perspective of a learner. If you are reading this and you are not Fedja, I recommend you read his answer instead of this. We will deploy the least-squares method to find numerical approximations of the $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ . Let's establish a few important functions: A mathematical expression for the radius, in terms of the variables a,b,c,ra,rb, and rc. I recommend referring to the answer provided by Joshua Wang for a detailed understanding. $R=\sqrt{\frac{\left(x^2+y^2+xy\right)\left(x^2+z^2+xz\right)\left(y^2+z^2+yz\right)}{3x^2y^2+3x^2z^2+3y^2z^2+6x^2yz+6{xy}^2z+6xyz^2}}$ The mean quadratic error G. This function returns the square root of the sum of the squared errors for each measurement point $(k)$ . It provides a measure of how well the given guess ( $r_a$ , $r_b$ , $r_c$ ) fits the measurements. This is the function that is being minimized in order to find the values of $r_a, r_b$ and $r_c$ that provides the best fit to the given measurements. $G\ =\ \sqrt{\frac{1}{K}\ \sum_{k=0}^{K}\left(Error_k\right)^2}$ Where, $K$ is the number of measurements. $Error_k=\sqrt{\frac{\left({x_k}^2+{y_k}^2+x_k\ast y_k\right)\left({x_k}^2+{z_k}^2+x_kz_k\right)\left({y_k}^2+{z_k}^2+y_kz_k\right)}{3{x_k}^2{y_k}^2+3{x_k}^2{z_k}^2+3{y_k}^2{z_k}^2+6{x_k}^2y_kz_k+6x_k{y_k}^2z+6\ast x_ky_k{z_k}^2}}-R$ Where $x_k=a_k+r_a $ $y_k=b_k+r_b $ $z_k=c_k+r_c $ $F(x,y,z)$ â This function is used as a constraint in the algorithm to ensure that the calculated values of $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ satisfy the given measurements. $F\left(x,y,z\right)=3x^2y^2+3x^2z^2+3y^2z^2+6x^2yz+6{xy}^2z+6xyz^2-\frac{\left(x^2+y^2+xy\right)\left(x^2+z^2+xz\right)\left(y^2+z^2+yz\right)}{R^2}$ The partial derivatives of $F\left(x,y,z\right)\ - F_x\left(x,y,z\right)$ , $F_y\left(x,y,z\right)$ , $F_z\left(x,y,z\right)$ with respect to $x,\ y,\ z$ .
The partial derivatives are an essential to optimization process as they directly affect magnitude and direction that $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ is incremented with each iteration ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ . $F_x(x,y,z) = 6xy^2+ 6xz^2+ 12xyz + 6y^2 z + 6yz^2 - \frac{(2x + y)(x^2+ z^2+ xz)(y^2+ z^2+ yz)}{R^2} -\frac{(x^2+ y^2+ xy)(2x + z)(y^2+ z^2+ yz)}{R^2} $ $F_y\left(x,y,z\right)=F_x\left(x,y,z\right) $ $F_z\left(x,y,z\right)=F_x\left(x,y,z\right) $ (Due to the symmetry of $F(x,y,z)$ ) An system of linear equations for the increments ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ .
These equations represent the conditions that need to be satisfied for the increments ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ to ensure that the changes in the function $F\left(x,y,z\right)$ with respect to each variable are zero at the specific point ${(x}_k{,y}_k{,z}_k)$ . $F_x\left(x_k,y_k,z_k\right)dr_a{+F}_y\left(x_k,y_k,z_k\right)dr_b+F_z\left(x_k,y_k,z_k\right)dr_c=-F(x_k,y_k,z_k)$ The left-hand side of this equation represents change in $F$ at the point ${(x}_K{,y}_K{,z}_K)$ caused by the increments ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ , while the right-hand side is the negative value of $F$ at that point. By setting them equal to each other, you are essentially trying to make the net change in $F$ equal to zero. This equation ensures that the increments ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ are chosen in a way that counteracts the change in $F$ caused by variations in $(x, y, z)$ and moves the solution towards the desired minimum or maximum of $F$ with each iteration. $\frac{f(x_K,y_K,z_K)}{R}\ dr_a=0 $ $\frac{f(x_K,y_K,z_K)}{R}\ dr_b=0 $ $\frac{f(x_K,y_K,z_K)}{R}\ dr_c=0 $ These equations represent additional constraints on the increments ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ .
These equations ensure that the increments ${dr}_a{,dr}_b$ and ${dr}_c$ are constrained in a way that aligns with the behaviour of the function $F(x_K,y_K,z_K)$ and its relationship with $R$ . By satisfying these conditions, the algorithm can find solutions that minimize the error and converge towards the desired result. With the required functions established lets define the steps of the iterative method. The following steps will be executed: Initialize the values of $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ to some initial guess, such as $R/2$ . Construct the matrices $U$ and $V$ by evaluating the partial derivatives and function values for each measurement point $k$ . Solve the system of linear equations to obtain the increments $V$ $V\ =\left(U^TU\right)^{-1}U^TV$ Update $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ by adding the corresponding elements of $V$ to the previous values. Check if any of the updated values of $r_a$ , $r_b$ , or $r_c$ are negative. If so, revert them back to their previous values. Calculate the mean quadratic error $G$ based on the updated values of $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ Compare the new mean quadratic error $G$ with the previous minimum error $e$ If it is lower, update $e$ and store the values of $r_a$ , $r_b$ and $r_c$ as the new suspected minimizer. Repeat steps 2-7 until the termination condition is met (e.g., when $e$ is within the desired tolerance or after a maximum number of iterations). We can now implement these steps.

4730612,Differentiation on an arbitrary set,"The subject of this question is differentiability of a function on an arbitrary set. It doesn't matter if we exclude isolated points from the domain of a function. So, let $X$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ whose every point is an accumulation  point of $X$ . For a function $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and a point $p\in X$ , we can define $fâ(p)=\lim\limits_{x\to p}\frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p}$ . If this limit exists at all points $p\in X$ , $f$ is differentiable . Two other definitions are known for the differentiability of a function on an arbitrary subset. The question is that if $f$ is differentiable in the above sense, is it differentiable in each of the following senses? (1) $f$ is differentiable if there is an open set $U$ including $X$ and a differentiable function $\tilde{f}:U\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f=\tilde{f}|X$ . (2) $f$ is differentiable is for all $x \in X$ , there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ and a differentiable function $\tilde{f}:U\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f|U\cap X=\tilde{f}|U\cap X$ .

Then we can conclude that $A=C(X)$ . This is how the Stone-Weierstrass theorem is stated on the book Foundations of Modern Analysis by Avner Friedman (Theorem 3.7.1). If we remove the closed hypothesis from $A$ , then the closure of $A$ is $C(X)$ , that is, every continuous function defined on $X$ can be approximated (uniformly) by functions from $A$ . The main application of this theorem is that every function defined on a compact subset $X\subset\mathbb R^n$ can be approximated by polynomials. My question is: Can we find a set $A$ of continuous functions defined on a compact subset $X\subset\mathbb R^n$ that has no polynomial functions, with the exception maybe of the constant ones, but still every continuous function defined on $X$ can be uniformly approximated by functions from $A$ .","['continuity', 'analysis', 'compactness']"

I'm trying to evaluate the following integral in a closed form: $$\mathcal U=\int_0^1\int_0^x\int_{xâ¯-â¯y}^{xâ¯+â¯y}\sqrt{S(x,y,z)â}âdzâdyâdx.\tag2$$ I wasn't able to evaluate it symbolically (either manually or using Mathematica ), but using numerical integration and heuristic methods, I found a plausible form: $$\mathcal U\stackrel{\color{gray}?}=\frac\pi{12\sqrt{2â}}+\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac14\right)^4\sqrt{10â}}{1440â\pi^2}\left(\left(\small\frac12-\frac1{\sqrt{5â\phiâ}}\right)\textbf K(\alpha)^2-\textbf K(\alpha)â\textbf E(\alpha)\right)\\ \quad\quad\;\approx0.117599420842157114228246644831065494814051852697â¦,\tag3$$ where $\textbf K(\cdot),\textbf E(\cdot)$ are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and the second kind, and $\alpha=\frac1{\phiâ\sqrt2}+\frac1{\sqrt{2â\phi}}$ . Can we prove that $(3)$ is indeed the true value of the integral? Update: You might ask, what heuristic methods could possibly give us the conjectured value? Here is a brief explanation. First, calculate a sequence of values of $\int\!\int\!\int S^{2n}dzâdyâdx,n\in\mathbb N;$ their evaluation is straightforward and they are all rational numbers. Then, use FindSequenceFunction to find a possible recurrence relation for that sequence. We need at least $30$ elements of the sequence to get a result: $$\small{(5+2 n)^2 (7+4 n) (9+4 n) (11+4 n) (27+20 n)\cdot a(n+2)=\\4 (2+n) (7+4 n) \left(6750+16947 n+15764 n^2+6416 n^3+960
   n^4\right)\cdot a(n+1)+\\128 (1+n)^2 (2+n) (3+2 n) (3+4 n) (47+20 n)\cdot a(n)}\tag4$$ Of course, there is no guarantee that this relation holds for all larger $n$ , but we cross our fingers ð¤ and conjecture that it does. Next, use FunctionExpand to find a possible explicit expression for the general term determined by this recurrence relation; it's complicated and involves generalized hypergeometric functions; we also need to manually adjust a periodic factor to ensure the result remains real even for non-integer $n$ . After some simplifications we arrive at this: $$\small\tfrac{4^n (20 n+27) \Gamma (2 n+2)\sqrt\pi}{(n+1) (16 n+12) \Gamma \left(2 n+\frac{7}{2}\right)}\,{_5F_4}\left(1,n+\tfrac{3}{2},n+\tfrac{3}{2},n+\tfrac{3}{2},n+\tfrac{47}{20};n+\tfrac{27}{20},n+\tfrac{7}{4},n+2,n+\tfrac{9}{4};-4\right)\tag5$$ Then we cross our fingers again ð¤ and conjecture that the same formula holds for all non-integer $n$ as well. Next, substitute $n=1/4$ and use FunctionExpand again to expand the generalized hypergeometric functions in terms of elliptic integrals. The result is quite large and unwieldy ( $19$ terms), but it appears to match the integral numerically, which is a sign we might be on the right track. We cross our fingers one more time ð¤ and conjecture that only a few terms of the expression are actually linearly independent over $\mathbb Z,$ and the result can be significantly simplified. Using FindIntegerNullVector and high enough numeric precision, we find a possible basis, and a linear combination of its elements that numerically matches the integral. After some radical denestings (using ResourceFunction[""RadicalDenest""] ) and other simplifications, this gives us the conjectured value $(3).$","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'calculus', 'closed-form', 'elliptic-integrals']"
4730737,Expanding a Probability Tree,"Consider the following situation: Take some integer $N$ Each day there is a: $p_1$ probability that $N$ will increase by $n_1$ % of its current value $p_2$ probability that $N$ will decrease by $n_2$ % of its current value $p_3 = 1- p_1+ p_2$ probability that $N$ keep its current value My Question: On any given day, I am trying to find out what possible values $N$ can assume - and what are the probabilities of assuming these values. To solve this question, I first wrote the possible values that $N$ can take on the first day: $$N_{1} = N \times [ p_3 + p_1(1+n_1) + p_2(1-n_2)]^{1}$$ On the second day, we can write: $$N_{2} = N \times [ p_3 + p_1(1+n_1) + p_2(1-n_2)]^{2}$$ $$  N_{2} = N \times [p_3^2 + 2p_3p_1(1+n_1) + 2p_3p_2(1-n_2) + p_1^2(1+n_1)^2 + 2p_1(1+n_1)p_2(1-n_2) + p_2^2(1-n_2)^2]$$ By analyzing the above expression, I can indirectly see that on the second day, $N$ can have 9 possible values: $N$ can happen one possible way with probability $p_3^2$ $N*(1+n_1)$ can happen two possible ways with a total probability $2*p_3p_1$ $N*(1-n_2)$ can happen two possible ways with a total probability $2*p_3p_2$ $N*(1+n_1)^2$ can happen one possible way with probability $p_1^2$ $N*(1+n_1)(1-n_2)$ can happen two possible ways with a total probability $2*p_1p_2$ $N*(1-n_2)^2$ can happen one possible way with probability $p_2^2$ Based on this, I can observe that : $$(p_1 + p_2 + p_3)^2 = p_3^2 + 2p_3p_1 + 2p_3p_2 + p_1^2 + 2p_1p_2 + p_2^2 = 1$$ Thus, it would appear that I could find out all possible values that $N$ can assume on any given day along with the corresponding probabilities using the relationship: $$N_{k} = N \times [ p_3 + p_1(1+n_1) + p_2(1-n_2)]^{k}$$ Is my understanding correct? Can this above logic be used to expand any Probability Function corresponding to any Discrete Random Variable - and thus find out the possible values and corresponding probabilities that a Discrete Random Variable can take in the future? And is there a more compact way (in mathematical notation) to represent this expansion in the general case? Thanks!

In order to calculate the probability that a message is in its original form after 10 data transfers we first have to calculate the probability of one bit being transferred correctly and then do that for the next 100 bits to lastly calculate the probability of doing this 9 more times (10 total). so: P(X=100) = (1-p)^100 = (0.999)^100 and for 10 total transfers we get P(X=10) = ((1-p)^100)^10 == (0.999)^1000 ~= 0.3677 so the probability that the message is received in its original form is 0.3677 (~36.8%)",['probability']

We either go back one step, go forward one step or go forwards two steps, each with equal probability. Let us take $P_k$ to be the probability of starting at $x=k$ and hitting $x=0$ eventually.

Can we conclude that the limit $$\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)$$ exists? If not, what other condition we need to add to ensure the limit exists? Intuitively, this is true to me. The first functional equation means that each function value is a weighted average of some previous values, so overall it should converge to some sort of average of the ""seeding region"" $x\in(0,a]$ . But I can't really convert this intuition to a concrete proof. Another attempt I had was to try solving the functional equation. I can find the following solution basis $$f(x) = e^{tx},$$ where $t$ is a (potentially complex) solution to the equation $$ke^{-at} + (1-k) e^{-bt} = 1.$$ I don't know if this is the entire solution space, nor how to solve the coefficient for each term. Nevertheless, this equation always has a solution $t = 0$ , whose corresponding term in $f(x)$ would be a constant, which is the limit if it exists. All other solutions $t$ have negative real components (but can be arbitrarily close to 0), meaning their corresponding term in $f(x)$ shrinks and has individual limit of 0. However, I don't think I can directly say the limit of the function is the sum of the limit of each term in this case. Another path I tried to explore is to consider the function on a grid $F: \mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ , $F(x, y) = f(ax+by)$ . It would be a great first step to prove that $\lim_{\mathbf{v}\to(+\infty,+\infty)}F(\mathbf{v})$ exists, and then we can ""fill in"" other values for $f(x)$ using continuity. On the grid, it can be seen that what contributes to $F(x, y)$ is a structure similar to binomial expansion: \begin{aligned}
F(x, y) &= kF(x-1, y) + (1-k) F(x,y-1)\\
&= k^2 F(x-2, y) + 2k(1-k) F(x-1,y-1) + (1-k)^2 F(x,y-2)\\

\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} 
$$ however such involutions have two $ -1 $ eigenvalues instead of one so they are not reflections in a codimension 1 hyperplane and so it is still hard to say if $ W_n $ is a coxeter group or not. As previously stated, it is the case that $ C_2^n,S_n,W(B_n),W(D_n) $ are all Coxeter groups. But what about $ W_n $ ? Question: Is it the case that $ W_n \cong W(D_n) $ if and only if $ n $ is odd?

What I observe in the initial step is the numerator is positive because of the even powers and denominator is negative because cubic power dominates square power and we get negative in the denominator. Still what if we didn't knew the initial step and knew only the last one. How one will conclude it's $-\frac{2}{3}$ . Whether $x \to -\infty \;\text{or}\; \infty$ the last expression always comes out to be $\frac{\sqrt{16}}{6}$ or my steps are wrong?,"['limits', 'calculus']"

Now, we must prove that if $xax^{-1} = yay^{-1}$ , that $C_a x = C_a y$ . My progress is that $xax^{-1} = yay^{-1}$ implies that $(y^{-1}x)a = a(y^{-1}x)$ , so $y^{-1}x \in C_a$ .

4731499,More examples of morphisms of ringed spaces that aren't local?,"$\def\Spec{\operatorname{Spec}}$ All questions and answers that I've found in MSE regarding a morphism of ringed spaces between affine schemes that isn't a morphism of locally ringed spaces are the same example, namely, this one . On the other hand, there are infinite counterexamples for l.r.s. that aren't affine schemes: given any non-local morphism of local rings $R\to S$ , the morphism of ringed spaces $(\{*\},R)\to(\{*\},S)$ is not local. But can we produce more counterexamples between affine schemes different from the linked one? In Example 6.17 here (p. 29) one finds a morphism of ringed spaces $\Spec\mathbb{Q}\to\Spec\mathbb{Z}$ that is not local. More generally, given a PID $R$ and a prime $(p)\in R$ , we can similarly produce a non-local ringed spaces morphism $\Spec Q(R)\to\Spec R$ that sends $*\in\Spec Q(R)$ to $(p)$ . However, this idea reduces to that of the first linked case with the DVR $R_{(p)}$ , by factoring the last morphism as $\Spec Q(R)\to\Spec R_{(p)}\to\Spec R$ (where the second arrow is the morphism of l.r.s. induced by $R\to R_{(p)}$ ). So: can we cook up some genuinely new kind of morphism of ringed spaces $\Spec B\to\Spec A$ that is not of l.r.s.? Maybe this has been answered here before, but I have been unable to find it. (My question is motivated by, assuming $B$ is Jacobson, trying to find a morphism of ringed spaces $\Spec B\to\Spec A$ that is not of l.r.s. but such that the composite $\operatorname{Spm}B\to\Spec B\to\Spec A$ is a morphism of l.r.s. If such a morphism $\Spec B\to\Spec A$ were to exist, this would imply that at least one of â $A$ is Jacobson,â â $A\to B$ is of finite typeâ is false.) EDIT: I just found a proof that if $B$ is Jacobson and the composite $\operatorname{Spm}B\to\Spec B\to \Spec A$ is a morphism of l.r.s., then so is $\Spec B\to\Spec A$ . However, I'm still interested on the original question of constructing novel examples of non-local morphisms of ringed spaces between affine schemes.","['affine-schemes', 'ringed-spaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'examples-counterexamples']"
4731557,Probability of winning a match given probability of winning a game,"If a team has probability p of winning each game, and if the team wins/loses a match when it is 2 games ahead/behind the other team, is there an analytical formula or approximation for the probability that the team wins the match, as a function of p? One can of course resort to Monte Carlo. Here is what I tried: p = prob of A winning each game
p1 = prob of A winning when match tied
p2 = prob of A winning when ahead by 1 game
p3 = prob of A winning when behind by 1 game

p1 = p*p2 + (1-p)*p3 = p*p2 + p3 - p*p3
p2 = p + (1-p)*p1    = p + p1 - p*p1
p3 = p*p1 + 1 - p    = p*p1 + 1 - p

plug last into first:

p1 = p*p2 + (1-p) * (p*p1 + 1 - p)

plug 2nd into above

p1 = p*(p + p1 - p*p1) + (1-p) * (p*p1 + 1 - p)
   = p^2 + p*p1 - p^2*p1 + p*p1 + 1 - p - p^2*p1 - p + p^2

The inner product of $x$ and $z$ is minimized when the angle between them is the largest and this happens when all three vectors are coplanar and $x$ and $z$ are on opposite sides of $y$ $$\therefore \min \langle z, x \rangle = \cos{(\theta + \phi)} = \cos{\theta} \cos{\phi} - \sin{\theta} \sin{\phi} = ab - \sqrt{1 - a^2} \sqrt{1 - b^2}$$ I however want to approach this question from a purely algebraic perspective without involving trigonometric or visualization, using purely the results from the algebra of inner product spaces.

4731696,Proof that $V$ is an open set,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{n}\to \mathbb{R}$ be of class $C^{k+2}$ , $k \ge 0$ and suppose that, for each $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{n}$ , the matrix: $$\bigg{[}\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial y_{i}\partial y_{j}}(x,y)\bigg{]}_{1\le i,j\le n}$$ is positive. In other words, for each fixed $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ , the mapping $y \mapsto f_{x}(y) = f(x,y)$ is strictly convex. For each fixed $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $p \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ , define $\varphi_{x,p}: \mathbb{R}^{n}\to \mathbb{R}$ by: $$\varphi_{x,p}(y) = \langle y, p \rangle - f(x,y).$$ It follows from the hypothesis on $f$ that $\varphi_{x,p}$ has at most one critical point and, any such critical point (if it exists) is a global maximum. I want to prove the following: Proposition: The set $V =\{(x,p)\in \mathbb{R}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{n}: \mbox{$\varphi_{x,p}$ has a global maximum}\}$ is nonempty and open. Attempted Proof: Note that $(x,p) \in V \iff \exists y_{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $\nabla_{y}\varphi_{x,p}(y_{0}) = 0 \iff \nabla_{y}f(x,y_{0}) = p$ . Hence: $$V = \{(x,p) \in \mathbb{R}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{n}: \mbox{$ y_{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $\nabla_{y}f(x,y_{0}) = p$}\}$$ For each $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ fixed, $\nabla_{y}f(x,\cdot)$ is injective and, hence, invertible. Let $p$ be an element of its range. In this case, there exists a unique $y_{0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $\nabla_{y}f(x,y_{0}) = p$ , so that $V \neq \emptyset$ . My question is: how to prove $V$ is open? I sketched the following proof. Let $V_{x} = \{p \in \mathbb{R}^{n}: \mbox{$p=\nabla_{y}f(x,y_{0})$ for some $y_{0}$}\}$ . This is open because it is the pre-image of $\nabla_{y}f(x,\cdot)$ . Now $V = \bigcup_{x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}}\{x\}\times V_{x}$ . But is this set open? Note: the notation $\nabla_{y}f(x,y)$ means $(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y_{1}}(x,y),...,\frac{\partial f}{\partial y_{n}}(x,y))$ .","['multivariable-calculus', 'solution-verification', 'convex-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

Notice that all these steps where valid only for $k>1$ , so we would get $$\mathcal{S}=\log\left(\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\right)+\frac{\gamma}{2}\left(1-\frac{\pi^2}{12} \right) +\sum_{k=2}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k^2}\left[\frac{1}{2n}+\log\left(1-\frac{1}{k+2n}\right)\right]$$ which had me stuck. Attempt (2): I tried splitting the sum into even and odd terms, in order to get rid of the gamma functions. For instance, the odd terms form the following series: $$\mathcal{S_1}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{1}{(2k+1)^2}\log\left[ \frac{\Gamma(k+1+\frac12)}{\Gamma(k+1)} \right]$$ Now, using the fact that $$\frac{\Gamma(n+\frac12)}{\Gamma (n)}={{2n} \choose n}\frac{n}{4^n}\sqrt{\pi}$$ we have $$\mathcal{S_1}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{1}{(2k+1)^2}\log\left[{{2k} \choose k}\frac{2k+1}{4^k}\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \right]$$ $$=\frac{\pi^2}{8}\log\left(\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\right)+\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{1}{(2k+1)^2}\log\left[{{2k} \choose k}\frac{2k+1}{4^k} \right]$$ but now this series has this $\log$ term that is difficult to handle. We can't even split it using $\log$ properties, since the resulting series wouldn't converge at all. Attempt (3): It can be shown that $$\int_0^1\int_0^1\frac{\log(1+x^a)}{1+x}\text{d}x \text{d}a=2\log^22+\frac{\pi^2}{24}\log\pi+\mathcal{S}$$ and notice that here, changing the order of integration is allowed. I couldn't evaluate this double integral either in the end. EDIT: Attempt (4): Using this we can rewrite $\mathcal{S}$ as: $$\mathcal{S}=-\frac{\pi^2}{24}\log\pi-\int_0^1\frac{\text{Li}_2(-x)+\frac{\pi^2}{12}}{(x+1)\log x}\text{d}x$$ and this integral is similar to the ones that appear here and here , so maybe it can be expressed as a series involving harmonic numbers as well?","['integration', 'analysis', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'sequences-and-series']"

If $p$ is a base point for $V$ I have that $E(p)\neq0$ for each $E\in V:$ hence we must have $E(p)\geq 1,$ since each divisor $E\in|D|$ satisfies $E\geq0.$ If we take a function $f\in\overline{V}$ we can consider the divisor $E=\operatorname{div}(f)+D\in V:$ using the previous observation and we must have $$\operatorname{ord}_p(f)+D(p)\geq 1$$ To conclude I must prove that $\operatorname{ord}_p(f)\geq1,$ and this is certainly true if $D(p)\leq0,$ but I don't see how to continue from this point if $D(p)\geq 1.$ I don't think this is a difficult thing to prove, since this is a simple observation in the notes, but I don't see how to conclude...","['riemann-surfaces', 'divisors-algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"
4731830,Another integral representation of Catalan's Constant?,"The integral in question: $$I=\int_{0}^{1} {\frac{\arctan\left(\frac{x-1}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\right)}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}}dx.$$ So I have a solution and it's rather straightforward, but I don't much like it. I'm not sure how to tackle this integral head-on, as you'll see, and I was wondering if anyone had another way of arriving at the result. My Solution: Let $$I(a)=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} {\ln{(\sin{(x)}+a)}}\hspace{1pt}dx.$$ Then $$I'(a)=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} {\frac{1}{\sin{(x)}+a}}dx=\frac{2}{\sqrt{a^2-1}}\arctan{\left(\frac{a-1}{\sqrt{a^2-1}}\right)}.$$ To show this one can apply the Weierstrass Substitution and complete the square in the denominator. Now consider the following $$\int_{0}^{1} {\frac{2}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\arctan{\left(\frac{x-1}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\right)}}dx=I(1)-I(0).$$ Noticing the famous result $I(0)=-{\pi}\ln(2)/2$ (check 1 for more details) we have $$I=\frac{\pi}{4}\ln{(2)}+\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1} {\ln{(\sin{(x)}+1)}}\hspace{1pt}dx.$$ Using $$\sin{(x)}+1=2\sin{\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(x+\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\right)}\cos{\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\right)}$$ we arrive at the following $$I=\frac{\pi}{2}\ln{(2)}+2\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} {\ln{(\cos{(x)})}}\hspace{1pt}dx$$ and now by 2 we have $I=C$ , where $C$ is Catalan's Constant. If you have seen this integral before please let me know where and again if you have a different solution that would be much appreciated. :)","['integration', 'calculus', 'catalans-constant', 'definite-integrals']"
4731876,Why do complex numbers lend themselves to rotation?,"In the introductory complex analysis course I am taking, nearly every theorem relates to rotation and argument. Why do complex numbers love doing this so much?
I can understand why these theorems work; however, aside from basic knowledge of polar coordinates, I do not intuitively understand what property of complex numbers make rotation and angle such a common/convenient idea.","['complex-analysis', 'angle', 'complex-numbers', 'rotations']"
4731910,How to Create a Mathematical Model of an Elevator?,"This is a problem I have been thinking about for a while. Everyday, I take an elevator and observe that people get on and off. Given the current situation (i.e. what floor I am on and how many people are currently in the elevator) - I find myself always trying to guess: When the elevator will reach my destination? What floor will the elevator stop on next? How many people will enter and exit the elevator on the next stop? While I wait in the elevator, I always think: Suppose if we had an entire elevator log that detailed every elevator trip that was made over a year , and this included information how many people got on/off at each floor: How could we create a mathematical model to represent this system and answer the above questions? To begin, let's state some of the following conditions: The elevator has a maximum capacity of $n_k$ people : once $n_k$ people have entered the elevator, no one outside the elevator can request the elevator to stop. The elevator can only stop when someone inside requests the elevator to stop or once the elevator has reached the final floor. When the elevator starts, there are currently $n_0$ people on the elevator (where $n_0$ is some positive integer) There are $m$ floors in total On the $j^{th}$ floor (where $ j\leq m$ ) , the number of people that enter can be denoted by $x_j$ and the number of people that exit can be denoted by $y_j$ The immediate future of the elevator is only decided by the current situation of the elevator (i.e. what floor we are on and how many people are in the elevator) - i.e. the elevator has the memoryless property The time of day does is not being taken into consideration and is being considered as irrelevant in this problem (i.e. peak hours like lunch break, end of day, etc. are not important). The first thing that comes to mind is to use (Discrete Time) Markov Chains. As such, I think the elevator can be thought of to contain two underlying Markov Chains: Markov Chain for Floor Transitions: A Markov Chain can be created which will look at the probability of the elevator stopping at any other floor given the current floor Markov Chain for Elevator Capacity: A Markov Chain (similar to a queue/birth-death process) can be created which will look at the net change in capacity given the current capacity My Question: Given access to the elevator log - I know how to create two independent Markov Chains to model floor transitions and elevator capacity independently. Using conditional probabilities, I could analyze the number of times the elevator was on the $i^{th}$ floor - and of those times, how many times was the next stop made at the $i^{th}$ floor: this information would serve as an estimate of $p_{i,j}$ , the probability of directly transitioning from the $i^{th}$ floor to the $j^{th}$ floor (note that $p_{j,i}$ does not need to be equal to $p_{i,j}$ ). Using conditional probabilities, I could also analyze the probability of the change in capacity. If the elevator current has 5 people - I could calculate what is the probability that after the next stop, there will now be 9 people. But it is unclear to me how to ""jointly"" model both of these Markov Chains together. For example, if the elevator reaches capacity at the 3rd last floor - it might be very likely that no one will request a stop until the final stop. However, if the elevator reaches maximum capacity early on - it might be more likely that someone on the elevator will have to go to an intermediate floor and give the elevator another chance to start accepting more passengers and take on more possible trajectories. I thought perhaps I could combine both of these chains together into a single chain - but the number of states in this single chain would explode in size , for example: State 1: 1st Floor, 0 People State 2: 1st Floor, 1 Person State 3: 1st Floor, 2 people State 4: 1st Floor, 3 people ... State 1-k: 1st Floor, $n_k$ people ... State k-m: $n_k$ people, $m^{th}$ floor Apart from resulting in a very large number states and make all computations difficult - more concerning would be the fact that I might not have enough data (i.e. joint combinations of floor transitions at varying capacity levels) to reliably estimate all state probabilities Can someone please advise me on how I can use Markov Chains to jointly model both of these processes (i.e. floor transitions and capacity)?

4732007,Tangents from a point to two given circles that form equal angles with a line passing through that point,Line $p$ and circles $k$ and $l$ are given. Construct  point $T$ on line $p$ such that  tangents to circles $k$ and $l$ from  point $T$ form equal angles with line $p$ . How many solutions are there? I don't know why but I just drew a line $t$ parallel to $p$ passing through the center of circle $l$ . Then I found the perpendicular bisector of $IJ$ where $I=t\cap l$ and $J=t \cap k$ . I thought the interesction of that perpendicular bisector with the line $p$ would be point $T$ . But apparently it's not even tho it's close. Any hints would be appreciated.
