4248517,Weaking the path test for multivariable limits,"The multivariable limit $\lim_{(x,y)\to (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y)$ exists and is equal to some scalar $L$ if and only if the limit $\lim_{t\to 1} f(r(t))$ exists and is equal to $L$ for all functions $r:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $\lim_{t\to 1} r(t) = (x_0, y_0)$ . It is common to use this fact as a way to conclude that a certain limit does not exist, by checking that taking the limit along different paths leads to different limits or by showing that the limit along a certain path does not exist. I wonder if this characterizarion can be weakened in the following way: The multivariable limit $\lim_{(x,y)\to (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y)$ exists and is equal to some scalar $L$ if and only if $\lim_{y\to y_0} f(x_0,y)=L$ and $\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x,g(x)) = L$ for all functions $g:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\lim_{x\to x_0} g(x) = y_0$ . That is, it the limit exists and is the same going through all graphs of functions $g(x)$ and through the $y$ axis, can I conclude the existence of the multivariable limit? EDIT: I substituted my initial condition of $\lim_{y\to y_0} \lim_{x\to x_0} f(x,y)=L$ by $\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x,g(x)) = L$ since, as Jos√© Carlos Santos noted in the comments, formalizes better the idea of approaching the limit vertically.","['multivariable-calculus', 'limits', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"
4248598,Convergence in bounded Lipschitz metric from convergence of bounded Lipschitz expectations,"Let $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $X$ be random variables and assume that $$

\sup_{f \in \textrm{BL}_1} |E(f(X_n)) - E(f(X))| \leq \sup_{f \in \textrm{BL}_1} |E(f(X_n)\mathbf{1}_{(X_n \not\in K)}) - E(f(X)\mathbf{1}_{(X \not\in K)})|  + \sup_{f \in \textrm{BL}_1} |E(f(X_n)\mathbf{1}_{(X_n \in K)}) - E(f(X)\mathbf{1}_{(X \in K)})|.

$$ I'm not sure how to deal with the second term though. It is clear that the inside of the second supremum goes to $0$ for each $f$ but I presume there's some way of relating this to the Lipschitz constant? Any ideas?

Specificaly, the exercise asks us to prove that the $i$ -eth term in the lower central series is the set of all unitriangular matrices with "" $0$ "" in the $i$ super-diagonals. In particular, this means the group is nilpotent of class $n-1$ . While I believe I could do it in a rather straightforward way by calculating the commutators explicitly (by hand), Rotman provides a hint: ""Given $A \in UT(n, \mathbb{Z}_p)$ , consider the powers of the matrix $A -I_n$ "". What I don't get is how to use this hint... I get that $A - I_n$ is nilpotent of class $n - z$ , where "" $z$ "" denotes the number of super-diagonals with only $0$ .

4249066,Reducing download time using prime numbers,"An issue has cropped up recently in programming with which I could greatly benefit from the expertise of proper mathematicians. The real-world problem is that apps often need to download huge chunks of data from a server, like videos and images, and users might face the issue of not having great connectivity (say 3G) or they might be on an expensive data plan. Instead of downloading a whole file though, I've been trying to prove that it's possible to instead just download a kind of 'reflection' of it and then using the powerful computing of the smartphone accurately reconstruct the file locally using probability. The way it works is like this: A file is broken into its bits (1,0,0,1 etc) and laid out in a predetermined pattern in the shape of a cube. Like going from front-to-back, left-to-right and then down a row, until complete. The pattern doesn't matter, as long as it can be reversed afterwards. To reduce file size, instead of requesting the whole cube of data (the equivalent of downloading the whole file), we only download 3 x 2D sides instead. These sides I'm calling the reflection for want of a better term. They have the contents of the cube mapped onto them. The reflection is then used to reconstruct the 3D cube of data using probability - kind of like asking a computer to do a huge three-dimensional Sudoku. Creating the reflection and reconstructing the data from it are computationally heavy, and as much as computers love doing math, I'd like to lighten their load a bit. The way I'm picturing is like a 10x10 transparent Rubik's cube. On three of the sides, light is shone through each row. Each cell it travels through has a predetermined value and is either on or off (either binary 1 or 0). If it's on, it magnifies the light by its value. If it is off, it does nothing. All we see is the final amount of light exiting each row, after travelling through the cube from the other side. Using the three sides, the computer needs to determine what values (either 1 or 0) are inside the cube. At the moment I'm using normal prime numbers as the cell values to reduce computing time, but I'm curious to know if there is another type of prime (or another type of number completely) that might be more effective. I'm looking for a series of values that has the lowest possible combination of components from within that series. Here is a rough diagram: It might help to imagine that light shines in at the green arrows, and exits with some value at the red arrows. This happens for each row, in each of the three directions. We're left with only three 2D sides of numbers, which are used to reconstruct what's inside the cube. If you look where the 14 exits on the left, it can have two possible combinations, (3 + 11 and 2 + 5 + 7). If for arguments sake we were to assume it were 3 and 11 (coloured green), then we could say at the coordinate where 3 and 11 exist, there are active cells (magnifying the light by their value). In terms of data, we would say this is on (binary 1). In practice we can rarely say for certain (for 2 and 3 we could) what an inside value has based on its reflection on the surface, so a probability for each is assigned to that coordinate or cell. Some numbers will never be reflected on the surface, like 1, 4 or 6, since they can't be composed of only primes. The same happens in the vertical direction, where the output is 30, which has multiple possibilities of which two correspond to the possibility shown in the horizontal direction with an exit of 14, coloured blue and pink (since they hit the 23, the same as 3 in the horizontal direction). This probability is also added to that coordinate and we repeat in the front-to-back direction, doing the same a final time. After this is done for each cell in the whole cube, we have a set of three probabilities that a cell is either on or off. That is then used as the starting point to see if we can complete the cube. If it doesn't 'unlock' we try a different combination of probabilities and so forth until we have solved the 3D Sudoku. The final step of the method is once the cube is solved, the binary information is pulled out of it and arranged in the reverse pattern to how it was laid out on the server. This can then be cut up (say for multiple images) or used to create a video or something. You could cough in theory cough download something like Avatar 3D (280GB) in around 3 minutes on decent wifi. Solving it (nevermind building the pixel output) would take a while though, and this is where I'm curious about using an alternative to prime numbers. You might have guessed that my maths ability goes off a very steep cliff beyond routine programming stuff. There are three areas of concern / drawbacks to this method: it is rubbish at low levels of data transfer. A 10 x 10 x 10 cube for instance has a larger 'surface area' than volume. That's because while each cell can hold one bit (either 1 or 0), each surface cell needs to be a minimum of 8 bits (one character is one byte, or 8 bits). We can't even have 'nothing', since we need null to behave as a type of placeholder to keep the structure intact. This also accounts for why in the above diagram, a 1000x1000x1000-cell cube has its surface areas multiplied by 4 characters (the thousandth prime is 7919 - 4 characters) and the 10'000(cubed)-cell cube has its surface areas multiplied by 6 characters (10'000th prime is 104729, six characters). The aim is to keep total character length on the 2D side to a minimum. Using letters could work, as we could go from a-Z with 52 symbols, before paying double bubble for the next character (the equivalent to ""10""). There are 256 unique ASCII characters, so that's the upper limit there. the factorials are still too high using prime numbers. Is there a series of numbers that are both short in character length (to avoid the problem above) and have very few possible parents? I'm leaning towards some subset of primes, but lack the maths to know which - some sort of inverted Fibonacci? The fewest possible combinations, the faster the computer will solve the cube. I haven't tested yet if its possible to use a third, fourth or nth side to increase either the capacity of the cube or the accuracy of the reflection. Using a say octahedron (yellow below) instead of a cube might be better, just hurts the brain a little to picture how it might work. I'm guessing it would tend towards a sphere, but that's beyond my ability. EDIT: Thank you for your helpful input. Many answers have referred to the Pigeonhole principle and the issue of too many possible combinations. I should also correct that a 1000 x cube would require 7 digits not 4 as I stated above, since the sum of the first 1000 primes is 3682913. I should also emphasise the idea isn't to compress in the common sense of the word, as in taking pixels out of an image, but more like sending blueprints on how to build something, and relying only on the computation and knowledge at the receiving end to fill in the blanks. There is more than one correct answer, and will mark correct the one with the most votes. Many thanks for the detailed and patient explanations.","['factorial', 'probability', 'prime-numbers']"
4249181,Unpacking a proof that the degree of the field extension $[L:L^H]$ is equal to $|H|$.,"I'm trying to understand the proof provided in this link . It goes as follows: Theorem : Let $L$ be a field and let $H$ be a finite subgroup of $\text{Aut}(L)$ . If $L^H$ is the fixed field of $H$ , then $$[L:L^H]=|H|$$ Proof : let $H=\{\sigma_1,\ldots ,\sigma_r\}$ . Every $\alpha \in L$ has a finite orbit $\{\sigma_1(\alpha),\ldots ,\sigma_r(\alpha)\}$ under $H$ , so the polynomial $$p(x)=\prod_i \big(x-\sigma_i(\alpha)\big)$$ is in $L^H[x]$ . This shows the extension is separable, normal, and that every element $\alpha\in L$ has degree lower or equal than the cardinality of $H$ . So $[L:L^H]$ is finite, and given that $H\leq \text{Gal}(L:L^H)$ we have that $[L:L^H]=|H|$ . There are a few things I do not understand about this proof: Why is the extension separable? Is it not possible that $\sigma_i(\alpha)=\sigma_j(\alpha)$ for some $i\neq j$ ? Why is $[L:L^H]$ finite? Just because every element is algebraic over $L^H$ it does not follow that the degree of the extension is finite.

So, the only cases in which $S\cup \left( S+1\right)=\{1,2,3,4\}$ is when $S=\{1, 3\}$ and $S=\{1, 2, 3\}$ . In other words, we have two subsets which satisfy the relationship when $n=3$ . As mentioned, I did this for $n=1,2,3,4,5$ to find a pattern, and it appears to be the Fibonacci sequence, but again, I am completely unsure how to show this through induction.

4249266,Does $(n^p-1)/(n-1)=m^2$ have any positive integer solutions for $p\ge 2$ prime?,"I was working on my partial answer to this question, which led me to consider the diophantine equation $$
\frac{n^k-1}{n-1}=m^2
$$ with $k>1$ odd. It's not too hard to prove that if $(n,k)$ is a solution, then if $k$ is a perfect square, $(n,p^2)$ is a solution for all $p\mid k$ , and otherwise $(n,p)$ is a solution for $p\mid k$ the largest prime factor of $k$ with $\operatorname{ord}_p(k)$ odd. Therefore, it is natural to ask whether there are any solutions with $k=p$ prime. I have absolutely no idea to start. Perhaps note that $$(m^2)=\prod_{i=1}^{p-1}\left(n-\zeta_p^i\right)\subseteq\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p],$$ and that all the ideals in this product are pairwise coprime. Therefore, they must all be squares of ideals in $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]$ . Also, if $q\mid m$ is prime, then $q\equiv 1\pmod p$ and the decomposition of $(q)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]$ is $$
(q) = \prod_{i=1}^{p-1}\left(q,n-\zeta_p^i\right),
$$ whence $\left(q,n-\zeta_p\right)^2\mid \left(n-\zeta_p\right)$ . I have no idea to continue. Perhaps if the class group of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)/\mathbb{Q}$ has odd order, we can use that $(n-\zeta_p)$ must be the square of a principal ideal? Descending solutions: Suppose $(n,k)$ is a solution and $p^2\mid k$ for some prime $p$ , then $$
\frac{n^k-1}{n^{k/p^2}-1}\cdot \frac{n^{k/p^2}-1}{n-1} = m^2.
$$ Let $q\mid n^{k/{p^2}}-1$ be prime, then $\frac{n^k-1}{n^{k/p^2}-1}=\sum_{j=0}^{p^2}(n^{k/p^2})^j\equiv p^2\pmod q$ . Hence, the only prime that can possibly divide both $\frac{n^k-1}{n^{k/p^2}-1}$ and $\frac{n^{k/p^2}-1}{n-1}$ is $p$ . However, if $p$ divides both, let $t:=\operatorname{ord}_p(n^{k/p^2}-1)$ and let $g$ be a primitive root mod $p^{t+3}$ . Write $n^{k/p^2}\equiv g^a\pmod {p^{t+3}}$ , then $\operatorname{ord}_p(a)=t-1$ , whence $\operatorname{ord}_p(p^2a)=t+1$ , so $\operatorname{ord}_p(n^k-1)=t+2$ . We conclude that $\frac{n^k-1}{n^{k/p^2}-1}$ and $\frac{n^{k/p^2}-1}{n-1}$ are both perfect squares. In particular, $(n,k/p^2)$ is a solution. This way, we can remove the $p^2$ factors from $n$ one by one, until we're either left with an exponent which is itself a square of a prime (if $k$ is a perfect square) or with a square-free exponent. Assume we end up with a solution $(n,k)$ with $k$ square-free. Let $p\mid k$ be the smallest prime factor of $k$ . Note that the product of $(n^k-1)/(n^{k/p}-1)$ and $(n^{k/p}-1)/(n-1)$ is a perfect square, and that $p$ is the only prime that can possibly divide both. However, $(p-1,k/p)=1$ , so if $p\mid n^{k/p}-1$ then $p\mid n-1$ and $p\nmid (n^{k/p}-1)/(n-1)$ . Therefore, $(n^{k/p}-1)/(n-1)$ is a perfect square, and $(n,k/p)$ a new solution. This is how we can remove the primes from $k$ one by one, until only the largest remains.","['algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'galois-theory']"
4249279,power series expansion of holomorphic function self-composes to the identity,"I struggle with the following problem that I came across dealing with discontinuous group actions on Riemann surfaces. Let $D\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ be a domain that contains $0$ and $f:D\to\mathbb{C}$ a holomorphic function with the power series expansion $f(z)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_iz^i$ at $z=0$ . The function satifies $f(0)=0$ , i.e. $a_0 = 0$ , and there exists a $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $f_k:=\underbrace{f\circ...\circ f}_{k\text{-times}}\neq\operatorname{Id}$ for $k=1,...,n-1$ and $f_n=\operatorname{Id}$ . Prove or disprove the following : $a_k=0$ for all $k>1$ and $a_1$ is a $n$ -th root of unity. Surely $a_1$ is a primitive root of unity. If $f$ was a polynomial, the rest would be easy too (although I have a feeling that it is easy either way and I'm just blind): if $f(z)=\sum_{i=0}^m a_iz^i$ , then the leading coefficient of $f_n$ would be a power of $a_m$ and equal to zero, so $a_m=0$ , and by induction the same follows for all coefficients. With $f$ not being a polynomial, I thought I could start computing the second coefficient of $f_m$ and show that $a_2=0$ and so on. However, the second coefficients is, if I'm correct, $a_2\sum_{j=m-1}^{2m-2}a^j$ . Since $a_1$ must be a primitve $n$ -th root of unity, the sum is equal to the sum of all $n$ -th roots of unity and hence 0. Thus the second coefficient of $f_n$ is zero independent of what $a_2$ is. Same for the third coefficient. I feel like computing coefficients won't help here and some other (maybe geometric) tool is needed, but I can't think of one that helps.","['complex-analysis', 'power-series', 'analysis']"

Here, the max-norm is defined as $|v|_{\infty}=\max_{i}|v_{i}|$ and the distance function $d_{K}(\cdot)$ is defined to be $d_{K}(x):=\inf_{y \in K}|x-y|_{\infty}$ . Let us use the notation $D_{K}(x;v)$ to denote the directional derivative of $d_{K}(x)$ with respect to the direction $v \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ , i.e., $$D_{K}(x;v):=\lim_{h \to 0^{+}}\frac{d_{K}(x+hv)-d_{K}(x)}{h}$$ Then the question that I want to ask is: If $x$ is a point in $\mathbb{R}^{n}-K$ with $D_{K}(x;v) \leq 0$ for some $v \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ , then is it possible that there exists a sequence $\{ x_{n} \}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}-K$ and $\epsilon>0$ such that $x_{n}$ converges to $x$ and $D_{K}(x_{n};v) \geq \epsilon$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ? I provide some remarks and my opinions related to this question. If the ambient space was just a Euclidean space, i.e., $(\mathbb{R}^{n},|\cdot|_{2})$ , then the answer of this question is obviously NO. The reason is that the directional derivative $D_{K}(x;v)$ is continuous with respect to both $x$ and $v$ since $d_{K}(\cdot)$ is continuously differentiable ( $C^{1}$ ). I checked that this question also fails if $K$ is convex polytope. So, I guess that this statement is false for general convex and compact set $K$ in the real Banach space $(\mathbb{R}^{n}, |\cdot|_{\infty})$ but I don't have an idea to derive a contradiction for such a general set.

The same idea could be used to show that the ‚Äúright‚Äù group axioms are also sufficient. These sets of axioms might be considered ‚Äúweak‚Äù group axioms, but I am curious whether we can get weaker. Consider the following ‚Äúultraweak‚Äù axioms: Let $G$ be a set and $*$ be a binary operation on $G$ satisfying: $*$ is associative. There exists an ultraweak identity element $e\in G$ such that for all $x\in G,$ either $e*x = x$ or $x*e=x$ (that is, the ‚Äúsidedness‚Äù of $e$ may differ for each element of $G$ ). For all $x \in G$ there exists an ultraweak inverse $x^{-1}\in G$ such that either $x^{-1} * x = e$ or $x*x^{-1}=e$ (that is, each element of $G$ has at least a one-sided inverse, where the side may differ for each element). Do these axioms guarantee that $(G,*)$ is a group? And if not, how much closer to these axioms can we get, starting from just the ‚Äúweak‚Äù left or right axioms? [For example, maybe assuming an ultraweak identity element with left (or right) inverses is sufficient.] REVISED UPDATE: In the comments to the accepted answer by Vincent, @Yakk asks whether the following condition is sufficient to guarantee a group (assuming associativity of $*$ ): There exists an $e\in G$ such that for all $x\in G$ , either (1) $e*x=x$ and there exists an $x'\in G$ such that $x'*x=e$ , or (2) $x*e=x$ and there exists an $x'\in G$ such that $x*x'=e$ . At first I thought this was true due to the standard ""left identity + left inverses"" and ""right identity + right inverses"" cases applying element by element, but now I realize this reasoning is flawed (these proofs also require the one-sided inverse to have their own one-sided inverse with the same sidedness). So the question remains: Does the above condition, proposed by @Yakk, guarantee a group? Please provide a proof or counterexample. The answer to the revised update is ‚Äúyes;‚Äù see here . There remains a further question about even weaker conditions, where the left and right identities can be different elements.

My flawed thought process : When an ant lands on a point ""x"" foot away it can go either left or right (equal probability). So expected time taken by it is 0.5 x + 0.5 (1-x) = 0.5, which is independent of x. So all ants regardless where they land will take an expected time of 0.5min. However the solution says that the time taken is x or 1-x and we can just solve for expected value of maximum value of 500 X's. ( because x , 1-x are symmetric.) .

I have tried to derive a recurrence for $d(n,k)$ but not sure if it is right or not. Any help/ advice/ correction would be appreciated. Here is my attempt:
We count the ways to partition $[n]$ into $k$ cycles of length at least $2$ . There are two cases: 1st Case: If the cycle containing the element $n$ has length $2$ , then there are $n-1$ ways to pick its other element, and there are $d(n-2,k-1)$ ways to derange the remaining $n-2$ elements into $k-1$ cycles. 2nd Case: If the cycle containing the element $n$ has length $\geq$ 3, then skipping element $n$ in its cycle still leaves cycle of length at least $2$ , and we can produce a derangement of $[n-1]$ into $k$ cycles, which gives us $d(n-1, k)$ ways. On the other hand, every derangement of $[n]$ with $n$ into $k$ cycles arises from a derangement of $[n-1]$ of $k$ cycle by inserting $n$ immediately following some $x\in[n-1]$ on the cycle containing $x$ . So, there are $(n-1)d(n-1,k)$ of this type. So, the derived recurrence is $d(n,k)= (n-1)(d(n-2,k-1)+ d(n-1,k))$ Any help/ advice/ correction would be appreciated.","['derangements', 'solution-verification', 'combinatorics', 'combinatorial-proofs']"

Non-linear equations don't always have general solutions or transformations to simpler equations given particular solutions, but perhaps someone is aware of one for such an equation?

I tried generating large numbers of partial orders for larger $n$ (up to $n = 40$ ) and noticed that all posets I generated with this algorithm contain most of the tuples they could contain (about ~740 tuples on average; partial orders on $[40]$ can contain at most 820 tuples). Assuming this algorithm is still accurate with $n^2$ steps for larger $n$ , this would suggest that there are vastly more posets with a large number of tuples than there are posets with a small number of them. Since for each $n$ , there is exactly one smallest but $n!$ largest posets on $[n]$ , this intuitively makes sense to me, but are there any more exact results on how many ""large"" posets there are compared to ""small"" ones?","['order-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

4250550,Extension of functional calculus of continuous functions,"On Reed & Simon's book , we can find the following theorem, which is called the continuous functional calculus .

Theorem: Let $A$ be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$ . Then there exists a unique map $\phi: C(\sigma(A)) \to \mathscr{L}(\mathscr{H})$ with the following properties: (a) $\phi$ is an algebraic $*$ -homomorphism, that is: $$\phi(fg) = \phi(f)\phi(g) \quad \phi(\lambda f) = \lambda \phi(f) \quad \phi(1) = I \quad \mbox{and} \quad \phi(\bar{f}) = \phi(f)^{*}$$ (b) $\phi$ is continuous, that is, $||\phi(f)||_{\mathscr{L}(\mathscr{H})} \le C||f||_{\infty}$ for some $C>0$ . (c) If $f(x) = x$ then $\phi(A) = A$ . (d) If $A\psi = \lambda \psi$ , then $\phi(f)\psi = f(\lambda)\psi$ , $\psi \in \mathscr{H}$ , (e) $\sigma[\phi(f)] = \{f(\lambda): \lambda \in \sigma(A)\}$ (f) If $f \ge 0$ then $\phi(f) \ge 0$ (g) $||\phi(f)|| = ||f||_{\infty}$ . The proof of this theorem is given by the authors and I have no problem with it. Later in the book, the authors discuss the extension of this theorem for bounded Borel measurable functions. In this latter case, $\phi$ is now a map $\hat{\phi}: B(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathscr{L}(\mathscr{H})$ , where $B(\mathbb{R})$ denotes the space of all bounded Borel measurable functions on $\mathbb{R}$ . All properties (a) - (g) remain unchanged for $\hat{\phi}$ . The discussion uses spectral measures to prove this Borel functional calculus. However, the authors state that the Borel functional calculus can be proven directly by extending the above continuous functional calculus . Question: How do I extend the above stated continuous functional calculus to prove the Borel functional calculus? The authors give no hint on how to do it and I have no clue on how to approach such extension.

For the contestant, a strategy of always switching doors gives a $2/3$ probability of winning, and a strategy of never switching doors has a $1/3$ probability of winning. Intuitively the switching strategy is better because in order to win, you need to have choosen a door with a goat behind it; for the non-switching strategy, in order to win you need to have choosen the door with a car behind it. Since you're more likely to choose a goat door than the car door, you're better off switching. I have two further questions about this: I think it's clear that the contestant's ""gain"" from adopting a switching strategy is 2, in the sense that over many trials, the contestant is twice as likely to win by using the switching strategy. However, is there a way to compute a ""gain"" given that the contestant will only play the game once? How would we prove that the strategy of switching is optimal? I have searched but not found anything. Obviously if you only consider the two strategies, then computing the $2/3$ and $1/3$ probabilities above constitutes the proof. However, you could open up the model to allow for weird strategies like ""Always switch when selecting door 1 and Monty opens door 3, but switch only half the time when Monty selects door 2"", and so on.

4251039,$L^1(G)$ is a $C^*$-algebra $\iff$ $G$ is trivial,"Let $L^1(G)$ be the group Banach $*$ -algebra of a locally compact Hausdorff group $G$ . Then it is known that $L^1(G)$ is a $C^*$ -algebra if and only if the group $G$ is trivial. The proof of this fact can be found here and it is not elementary. To my surprise, I came across a seemingly much simpler and completely elementary proof in Vahid Shirbisheh's Lectures on $C^*$ -algebras , Proposition 2.2.21., Page 24. However, upon more careful reading, I think that the proof is wrong. It goes like this: Assume that $G$ is nontrivial and pick $s \in G\setminus \{1\}$ . Pick an open relatively compact neighbourhood $U$ of $1$ in $G$ such that $U \cap sU = \emptyset$ . Then by properties of left Haar measure we have $0 < \mu(U) < +\infty$ . If we define $$f : G \to \Bbb{C}, \quad f(x) := \frac1{\sqrt{\Delta(x)}}(\mathbf{1}_{U} - i \mathbf{1}_{sU})(x), \quad x \in G$$ it is easy to show that $f \in L^1(G)$ , where $\Delta : G \to \langle0,+\infty\rangle$ is the modular function. We have \begin{align}
\|f * f^*\|_{L^1(G)} &= \int_G |(f * f^*)(x)|\,d\mu(x)\\
&=\int_G \left|\int_G f(y)\Delta(x^{-1}y)\overline{f(x^{-1}y)}\,d\mu(y)\right|d\mu(x)\\
&= \int_G \left|\int_G \Delta(x^{-1}y)\cdot \frac{\mathbf{1}_{U}(y) - i \mathbf{1}_{sU}(y)}{\sqrt{\Delta(y)}}\cdot \frac{\mathbf{1}_{U}(x^{-1}y) + i \mathbf{1}_{sU}(x^{-1}y)}{\sqrt{\Delta(x^{-1}y)}}\,d\mu(y)\right|d\mu(x)\\
&= \int_G \frac1{\sqrt{\Delta(x)}} \left|\int_G (\mathbf{1}_U(y)\mathbf{1}_{U}(x^{-1}y) + i\mathbf{1}_U(y)\mathbf{1}_{sU}(x^{-1}y) - i\mathbf{1}_U(x^{-1}y)\mathbf{1}_{sU}(y) + \mathbf{1}_{sU}(y)\mathbf{1}_{sU}(x^{-1}y))\,d\mu(y)\right|d\mu(x)\\
&= \int_G \frac1{\sqrt{\Delta(x)}} \left|\mu(U \cap x U) + i \mu(U \cap xsU) - i\mu(xU \cap sU) + \mu(sU \cap xsU)\right|d\mu(x).
\end{align} Now comes the dubious step. The author writes (paraphrased): ""In the last integral each term of the integrand is non-zero at least for some values of $x\in G$ and when one of the terms is non-zero the other three terms are zero. This feature justifies the following steps of our argument:"" \begin{align}
\|f * f^*\|_{L^1(G)} &< \int_G \frac1{\sqrt{\Delta(x)}} (\mu(U \cap x U) +  \mu(U \cap xsU) +\mu(xU \cap sU) + \mu(sU \cap xsU))\,d\mu(x)\\

&= \int_G \left(\int_G \Delta(x^{-1}y)\cdot \frac{\mathbf{1}_{U}(y) + \mathbf{1}_{sU}(y)}{\sqrt{\Delta(y)}}\cdot \frac{\mathbf{1}_{U}(x^{-1}y) + \mathbf{1}_{sU}(x^{-1}y)}{\sqrt{\Delta(x^{-1}y)}}\,d\mu(y)\right)d\mu(x)\\
&= \int_G \left(\int_G \Delta(x^{-1}y)\cdot \left|\frac{\mathbf{1}_{U}(y) -i \mathbf{1}_{sU}(y)}{\sqrt{\Delta(y)}}\right|\cdot \left|\frac{\mathbf{1}_{U}(x^{-1}y) -i \mathbf{1}_{sU}(x^{-1}y)}{\sqrt{\Delta(x^{-1}y)}}\right|\,d\mu(y)\right)d\mu(x)\\
&= \int_G \left(\int_G \Delta(x^{-1}y)|f(y)||f(x^{-1}y)|\,d\mu(y)\right)d\mu(x)\\
&= \int_G \Delta(y)|f(y)|\left(\int_G |f(xy)|\,d\mu(x)\right)\,d\mu(y)\\
&= \int_G \Delta(y)|f(y)|\Delta(y^{-1})\left(\int_G |f(x)|\,d\mu(x)\right)\,d\mu(y)\\
&= \|f\|_{L^1(G)}^2.
\end{align} So, the idea seems to be to notice that the supports of the functions $$x \mapsto \mu(U \cap x U), \quad x \mapsto \mu(U \cap xsU), \quad x \mapsto \mu(xU \cap sU), \quad x \mapsto \mu(sU \cap xsU)$$ are pairwise disjoint and nonempty. Hence we somehow get the strict inequality, but I argue that it should in fact be equality. Precisely because the supports are pairwise disjoint we have $$\left|\mu(U \cap x U) + i \mu(U \cap xsU) - i\mu(xU \cap sU) + \mu(sU \cap xsU)\right|=\mu(U \cap x U) +  \mu(U \cap xsU) +\mu(xU \cap sU) + \mu(sU \cap xsU)$$ for all $x \in G$ . It is irrelevant that the supports are nonempty. My questions are: Is the proof indeed wrong? If yes, can it be easily fixed?","['c-star-algebras', 'measure-theory', 'representation-theory', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"
4251189,Interpretation of standard deviation,"I've come across many articles that describe standard deviation to be a measure of how much spread out our distribution is. In other words, it is a measure of how far away from the mean, we expect a data point to land. Now, imagine we have a distribution of random variables, like in the case of a symmetric random walk. The mean of the distribution is obviously $0$ . So we can write $\langle x_i \rangle = 0 $ . In this case, let $\sigma$ be the standard deviation. Then we have the following : $$\sigma^2 = \langle x_i^2 \rangle - \langle x_i\rangle^2$$ In our example, we can say : $$\sigma = \sqrt{\langle x_i^2\rangle}$$ The term on the right is often referred to as root mean squared distance in random walk and other problems of the sort. It is often interpreted as, if we repeat the experiment many many times, and take the squares of the final outcome, and average it, and then take the square root, our average outcome is $\sigma.$ What I know is, the likelihood of getting a data point is maximum between $+\sigma$ and $-\sigma$ i.e. within one standard deviation of the mean with a likelihood of around $70 $ percent. However, I still don't understand why many authors, interpret the root mean squared distance to be the average distance where we find the final answer. To me, the root mean squared distance is actually the boundary of the region (strip) where we are most likely to obtain our results. However, even though we are likely to obtain our data within the root mean squared distance, or the standard deviation, we do find many data points outside of this range. If we take an average of all these distances where we happen to find the range, it does lie around the standard deviation. Is this alternate interpretation of standard deviation correct? Normally standard deviation marks the boundary of the region in which, we are most likely to obtain the outcomes. However, it is also the average distance from the mean, where we expect our outcomes to be. This is usually the description of the root mean squared position, but in this instance, it is equivalent to the standard deviation. In random walk, most of our walkers, about $70$ percent of them, are found within the region bounded by $\pm \sigma.$ These walkers have taken more steps in one direction compared to the other. Since $\sigma \approx  \sqrt{n}$ , the difference in steps for 70 percent of walkers is less than $\sqrt{n}$ . However, for the rest of the walkers, about 30 percent of them, this difference is more than $\sqrt{n}$ and can be enormously large. So, we have 70 percent of walkers with a small difference in steps and a small no. of walkers with a large difference in steps. The average difference thus happens to lie around the standard deviation, and so it is often interpreted as the average distance where we happen to find our walker. Is this reasoning correct?","['statistics', 'standard-deviation', 'random-walk', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

4251469,Lemma 2.3. of Riemannian Geometry by do Carmo; Existence/Uniqueness of the Geodesic field $G$ on $TM$,"Lemma 2.3 states: There exists a unique vector field $G$ on $TM$ (+) whose trajectories are of the form $t\mapsto (\gamma(t),\gamma'(t))$ , where $\gamma$ is a geodesic on $M$ . Uniqueness: Suppose that there exists a vector field $G$ on $TM$ with (+). Choose $q\in TM$ . By assumption, we then know that the trajectory $\alpha:(-\delta,\delta)\to M$ with $\alpha'(t)=G(\alpha(t))$ and $\alpha(0)=q$ is of the form $\alpha(t)=(\gamma(t),\gamma'(t))$ , where $\gamma$ is a geodesic of $M$ . Now $\gamma$ , in local coordinates, has to satisfy a first order system with initial conditions given by $q$ , for which there is a unique solution. Since $\alpha'(0)=G(\alpha(0))=G(q)$ and $\alpha$ is completly determined by this unique solution $\gamma$ , we conclude that $G(q)$ is also uniquely determined. Since this holds for every $q\in TM$ , $G$ has to be unique. In order to show existence, do Carmo locally defines $G$ by the system mentioned above. It follows that the trajectories of $G$ are of the form $(\gamma,\gamma')$ . He finishes the proof by stating: Using the uniqueness, we conclude that $G$ is well-defined on $TM$ . My idea: In the uniqueness argument, we have shown that $G(q)$ is uniquely determined for every $q\in TM$ . It follows that for every open subset $O\subset TM$ , there also exists at most one vector field with the property (+). Now let $x:U\subset \mathbb{R}^n \to M$ and $y:V\subset \mathbb{R}^n \to M$ be two parametrizations with $x(U)\cap y(V)\neq \phi$ and denote by $G_x$ and $G_y$ their corresponding vector fields on $x(U)$ and $y(V)$ which satisfy (+) (which we know exist by the construction above). Then $G_x$ and $G_y$ also satisfy (+) on the open set $x(U)\cap y(V)$ . It follows that $G_x\bigg|_{x(U)\cap y(V)}=G_y\bigg|_{x(U)\cap y(V)},$ which shows that $G$ is well-defined. I am not sure if this argument is correct. It also seems a little too complicated to me/not what do Carmo intended.

$$ The result is conjectured. How can we prove it? This problem is derived from integrating the EGF of the Bernoulli & Euler polynomials after dividing it by a power of $x$ . See my previous post , which outlines the far more generalized problem (and a generalized conjecture).","['definite-integrals', 'bernoulli-polynomials', 'generating-functions', 'riemann-zeta', 'limits']"
4251527,Finding a basis for the canonical line bundle of $f=y^3-x^5+1$,"Consider the canonical line bundle $K_C$ for $C$ defined by the compactification of $f=y^3-x^5+1$ . $K_C$ is the as a set the set of holomorphic $1$ -forms on $C$ . How does one go about finding the basis for $K_C$ ? I have seen an example for hyperellptic curves that gives the basis as $z^adz/w$ , where $w$ is the product of rational functions having divisors precisely at ramification points and infinity. This does not even seem holomorphic to me, and I am thus confused in general.","['curves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'riemann-surfaces', 'differential-geometry']"
