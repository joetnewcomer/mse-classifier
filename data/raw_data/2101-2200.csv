I'm really hoping of something in the middle between Hartshorne's appendix and say Fulton's intersection theory (or Fulton-Lang RR algebra), which concentrates more on coherent sheaves.

14714,Characteristic Functions and motivations,"I've recently studied characteristic functions in my probability course and I can't get why we define it to be the Fourier transform of the distribution (if the random variabile is continuous). I mean that if $X$ is a random variable, $\varphi_X (t) = \mathbb{E}(e^{i t X}) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{i t x}f_X(x) dx$ where $f_X(x)$ is the distrubution function of $X$, and I can't see any motivation for doing this. I asked my professor but he wasn't clear at all; he said something like this: ""Since we proved the theorem that if $\varphi_X (t) = \varphi_Y (t)$ then $X \sim Y$ (or $P_X \equiv P_Y)$, it is natural to define it this way"". But of course, to prove that we need the definition! So I couldn't really make up my mind about it, if you could provide some help in this sense (motivation for defining the characteristic function of a random variable as the Fourier transform of its distribution) it would be much appreciated.",['probability-theory']
14715,The logic behind the rule of three on this calculation,"First,
to understand my question, checkout this one: Calculating percentages for taxes Second, 
consider that I'm a layman in math. So, after trying to understand the logic used to get the final result. I was wondering: Why multiply $20,000 by 100 and then divide by 83? I know this is the rule of three, but, I can't understand the ""internals""  of this approach. It isn't intuitive as think in this way: Say 100% of one value, is the same of divide this value by 100. In other words: I have 100 separeted parts of this integer. It's intuitive think about the taxes like this: $$X - 17\% = \$20.000$$ So: $$\$20.000 = 83\%$$ For me, the most easy and compreensive way to solve this is: $$\$20.000 / 83 = 240.96$$ It's the same as think, if 100% is 100 parts of one integer, 83% of that integer is the same of divide this integer by 83. And finally to get the result: $$\$20.000 + 17 * 240.96$$ My final question is: How can I think intuitively like this using the Rule of Three?
In other words, why multiply 20.000 by 100 and then divide by 83 is a shorcut to get the result?",['algebra-precalculus']

14735,Is a uniformly continuous function vanishing at $0$ bounded by $a|x|+c$?,"Let $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be uniformly continuous with $g(0)=0,c\geq 0, c \in \mathbb{R}$. Show: $$\exists a\geq 0 \in \mathbb{R}: \forall x \in \mathbb{R}: |g(x)| \leq a \cdot |x|+c$$ I could also say $g(x) \in \mathcal{O}(x)$. Notes: I could not make up any counterexample so I guess it could be true, all uniformly continuous functions I know grow too slowly. My approach: Given $\epsilon > 0$, we have that: $$\exists \delta(\epsilon): |x-y|<\delta=> |g(x)-g(y)|<\epsilon$$
because of the continuity of $g$. Now choose $n=\text{max}\{n \in \mathbb{N}: (n-1)\delta/2\leq|x|\}$. Obviously, such an $n$ exists, and $n > 0$. We also easily see that an upper bound for $n$ is $n \leq \frac{2}{\delta}|x|+1$. Now we use this to separate $|x|$ into $n-1$ distinct parts of size $s<\delta/2$, and the last part which is smaller than $\delta$ :
$$|x|=|x_1-x_0|+|x_2-x_1|+|x_3-x_2|+...+|x_n-x_{n-1}| < (n-1)\delta/2 + \delta = (n+1)\delta/2.$$ $$\begin{align}
\Rightarrow  |g(x)| & =|g(x_1)-g(x_0)+g(x_2)-g(x_1)+g(x_3)-g(x_2)+...+g(x_n)-g(x_{n-1})| \\
& \leq |g(x_1)-g(x_0)|+|g(x_2)-g(x_1)|+|g(x_3)-g(x_2)|+...+|g(x_n)-g(x_{n-1})| \\
& \lt n \cdot \epsilon \leq (\frac{2}{\delta}|x|+1) \cdot \epsilon = \frac{2\epsilon}{\delta} \cdot |x|+\epsilon
\end{align}$$ So we can see that the constant $c$ we were given can be set as the $\epsilon := c$, and that was also the reason why generally speaking $c>0$. Then we can choose $a := \frac{2\epsilon}{\delta}$, as our $\delta$ only depends on the $\epsilon$, and we have that $|g(x)| \leq a \cdot |x| + c$ for $c > 0$. $\quad \square$","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"
14742,Find the values of $m$ in the 2nd degree equation $(3m-2)x^2+2mx+3m=0$ so that it has only one root between -1 and 0.,"I am looking at the following problem: Find all values of $m$ for which the equation $(3m-2)x^2 + 2mx + 3m = 0$ shas only one root between $-1$ and $0$. I don't know what only one root between -1 and 0 actually means. I count these possibilities: $-1<x_1=x_2<0$ $x_1<-1<x_2<0$ $-1<x_1<0<x_2$ Let $a=3m-2$, $\Delta$ be the discriminant, and $S/2$ the $x$-coordinate of the vertex ($S/2 = -m/(3m-2)$) and also the arithmetic mean value of the roots $(x_1+x_2)/2$. Conditions to solve 1 alone would be:
$af(-1)<0$,
$af(0)<0$ and
$\Delta \geq 0$ Conditions to solve 2 alone would be:
$af(-1)<0$,
$af(0)>0$,
$\Delta>0$ and
$S/2<0$ Conditions to solve 3 alone would be: $af(-1)>0$,
$af(0)<0$,
$\Delta>0$, and
$S/2>-1$ Then it could also mean that it is all conditions intersected $ 1 \cap 2 \cap 3$
or just $2 \cap 3$. What am I doing wrong? the correct answer for this problem according to the book is $0<m<1/2$ PS.: Although this question was already answered correctly I would like to see how to use the theorems that I brought in, and the book as well, to solve this. Solving questions any way or another is always welcomed and helpful, what should certainly be done. Yet the purpose in the book is not a general math challenge, it's intended to teach the theorems and aplly them. So if I can, let me try it also: I will put the theorems here because no one seems to know what theorems I am refering to: If $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ presents two real roots $x_1 \leq x_2$ and $ \alpha $ is the real number that will be compared to $x_1$ and $x_2$, we have: $af(\alpha)<0 \implies x_1 < \alpha <x_2$. $af(\alpha)=0 \implies \alpha$ is one of the roots. If $af(\alpha)>0$ and $\Delta \geq 0$, then (a)  $\alpha <x_1 \leq x_2$ if $\alpha < S/2$; (b) $x_1 \leq x_2 < \alpha$ if $\alpha > S/2$ There is two situations in this problem: $-1<x_1<0<x_2$ and $x_1<-1<x_2<0$. I. $$-1<x_1<0<x_2 \implies af(-1)>0 \wedge af(0)<0 \wedge \Delta > 0 \wedge S/2 > -1.$$
\begin{align*}
af(-1)>0 &\implies (3m-2)[(3m-2)(-1)^2+2m(-1)+3m]>0\\
 &\implies (3m-2)(4m-2)>0 \implies 12m^2-14m+4>0\\
 &\implies m<1/2\text{ or }m>2/3.\\
af(0)<0 &\implies (3m-2)[(3m-2)0^2+2m0+3m]<0 \\
&\implies 9m^2-6m\lt 0 \implies 0\lt m\lt 2/3.\\
\Delta \gt 0 &\implies (2m)^2-4(3m-2)3m\gt 0 \implies 4m^2-12m(3m-2)\gt 0\\

S/2\gt -1 &\implies -b/2a\gt -1 \implies -m/(3m-2) \gt -1\\
 &\implies (-m+3m-2)/(3m-2) \gt 0 \implies (2m-2)/(3m-2) \gt 0\\
 &\implies m \lt 2/3 \text{ or } m \gt 1.
\end{align*} $$(af(-1) \gt 0) \wedge (af(0) \lt 0) \wedge (\Delta \gt 0) \wedge (S/2 \gt -1) \implies 0 \lt m \lt 1/2.$$ II. $$x_1<-1<x_2<0 \implies af(-1)<0 \wedge af(0)>0 \wedge \Delta > 0 \wedge S/2<0.$$

S/2 \lt 0 &\implies -b/2a<0 \implies -m/(3m-2)<0 \\
&\implies m \lt 0 \text{ or }m \gt 2/3.
\end{align*} $(af(-1)<0 \wedge af(0)>0 \wedge \Delta \gt 0 \wedge S/2 \lt 0) = \emptyset$ As both set of solutions are possible answers, non-exclusory, I think the answer is to unite the two sets: $I \cup II = (0 \lt m \lt 1/2) \cup \emptyset = 0 \lt m \lt 1/2$.

14786,Going to the Movies!,"I was looking at movie times today and was struck by the oddly-spaced showing times. For example, at the local Loew's Theater ""Tron: Legacy 3D"" (127 min.) is playing on two screens at the following interlaced times: 1:00 pm, 1:45 pm, 4:00 pm, 4:45 pm, 7:00 pm, 7:45 pm, 10:00 pm and 10:45 pm. Why not space the times equally? Is there an algorithm at work here? Other than optimizing food sales by cleverly keeping a pool of waiters, the strange times might have to do with overbooking and accommodating johnnys-come-lately. Consider the following idealized scenario. Suppose only $1$ movie is a playing at a theater with $n$ screens, and free popcorn and refreshments is given upon sitting in the theater, so no other factors are relevant for spacing movie times but ticket sales. Suppose each showing can accommodate at most $N$ people. Suppose $N \pm M$ arrive at the kiosk reasonably before any particular showing time, where $0 < M < N$, and $0 < L < M$ people show up just a little too late for any particular show -- the same number of latecomers come by each time. If any person has to wait for more than some fraction $0 < R < 1$ of the time $t$ of the movie in question to watch the next movie in the cue, then he/she returns the ticket and goes home. Suppose the $\pm$ sign above is governed by tossing a fair coin, $+$ for heads, $-$ for tails. Question: Given the above data, what is the optimal spacing of $X$ movie times, each movie of the same length $t$, on $n$ different screens that maximizes the total number of ticket purchases and (happy) moviegoers? If this question is too easy, then generalize the above scenario to multiple movies showing at the same theater. If this question is too hard, then simplify it. (Of course, feel free to edit and improve.) ( Added Thoughts ) The constraints above are in place to try to model the scenario as closely as possible while keeping the mathematics simple. I'd like to account for a little randomness, and the simplest truly non-trivial random event is the tossing of a fair coin. If $N - M$ or $N + M$ people come every time, then the problem is trivial or cumulatively impossible, respectively. What makes this problem tractable is that there are some occasions when some people are left out of a showing. These people are either at the end of a long cue or literally late; either way they must wait but few, if any, will wait longer than the length of the movie. I believe the answer of spacing depends heavily on the amount of wait time. That is, if $R = 0$, $L + M > 0$ people go home every time (not optimal). If $R = 1$, then any reasonable spacing should suffice to accommodate the extremely patient moviegoers. I think this possibility oversimplifies the problem, unless I'm missing something crucial or obvious. I suppose also that the condition $L < M$ could be relaxed to $L < N$, but my reasoning is that latecomers seem to be rarer than overbookers. Are these constraints reasonable?","['stochastic-processes', 'recreational-mathematics', 'probability']"

Wikipedia gives the definition: A set $S$ is called countable if there exists an injective function $f$ from $S$ to the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ It would seem to my mathematically naïve brain that such an injective function exists—for any element $r \in R$ you can simply ""reverse the number"" and remove the decimal point to end up with, e.g.,: $f(0.0001) = 10000$ This leads me to three questions: Is this intuition correct?

It is also true that the tensor product of line bundles corresponds to adding cohomology classes. It follows that if $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then the line bundles of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ are generated by the tensor powers of the tautological line bundle, or, equivalently, by the tensor powers of the sheaf typically denoted  $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in algebraic geometry (because the dual of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ is the tautological bundle). It is also true that the isomorphism classes of algebraic line bundles on $\mathbb{CP}^n$ forms  a group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, given by the powers of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, as one can see by studying the Weil class group. It follows that the isomorphism classes of line bundles are the same in both the algebraic and the topological category.

14917,Does there exist a Latin square of order 16 that admits a specific automorphism?,"One of the perks of my research topic (Latin squares) is that it's somewhat possible to explain what I do to those with a fairly minimal mathematics background.  I'll pose a typical question that comes up in one of my main research topics as a problem here  -- I'm hoping that this will whet the appetite of someone considering doing postgrad mathematics. A Latin square is an $n \times n$ matrix with symbols from $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ such that each row and each column contains every symbol. Let $L=(l_{ij})$ be a Latin square.  For any row $i$ and column $j$, We say $(i,j,l_{ij})$ is a entry of $L$.  The set of entries $O=\{(i,j,l_{ij}):i \in [n], j \in [n]\}$ is called the orthogonal array of $L$. An automorphism of $L$ is a permutation $\alpha$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ such that $O$ is preserved under $(i,j,l_{ij}) \mapsto (\alpha(i),\alpha(j),\alpha(l_{ij}))$. This definition might seem a little complicated, but we can view this property reasonably easily.  Here's an example for order 15: $\left(\begin{array}{cccccccccccc|ccc}

14919,Zebra groups and counting stripes,"How many stripes can you paint on a $2$-group of fixed size? A group of order $2^ap^b$ is solvable, by Burnside's theorem, so its chief factors are either abelian $2$-groups or abelian $p$-groups.  Such a group is a zebra group if its chief factors in any chief series alternate between the $2$ and the $p$.  In other words, if you take a chain of normal subgroups $$1 = N_1 ⊲ N_2 ⊲ \cdots ⊲ N_n = G$$ of maximal length, then the quotient groups $N_{i+1}/N_i$ alternate between being abelian $2$-groups (the stripes) and abelian $p$-groups (the background). If we fix $a$, say $a=8$, then how many stripes can a zebra group have? Obviously no more than $8$ $2$-stripes, but with a little work one can see that it can have no more than $4$ $2$-stripes.

14970,Choice of $q$ in Baby Rudin's Example 1.1,"First, my apologies if this has already been asked/answered.  I wasn't able to find this question via search. My question comes from Rudin's ""Principles of Mathematical Analysis,"" or ""Baby Rudin,"" Ch 1, Example 1.1 on p. 2.  In the second version of the proof, showing that sets A and B do not have greatest or lowest elements respectively, he presents a seemingly arbitrary assignment of a number $q$ that satisfies equations (3) and (4), plus other conditions needed to show that $q$ is the right number for the proof.  As an exercise, I tried to derive his choice of $q$ so that I may learn more about the problem. If we write equations (3) as $q = p - (p^2 - 2)x$ , we can write (4) as $$
q^2 - 2 = (p^2 - 2)[1 - 2px + (p^2 - 2)x^2].
$$ Here, we need a rational $x > 0$ , chosen such that the expression in $[...]$ is positive.  Using the quadratic formula and the sign of $(p^2 - 2)$ , it can be shown that we need $$
x \in \left(0, \frac{1}{p + \sqrt{2}}\right) \mbox{ for } p \in A,
$$ or, for $p \in B$ , $x < 1/\left(p + \sqrt{2}\right)$ or $x > 1/\left(p - \sqrt{2}\right)$ . Notice that there are MANY solutions to these equations! The easiest to see, perhaps, is letting $x = 1/(p + n)$ for $n \geq 2$ .  Notice that Rudin chooses $n = 2$ for his answer, but it checks out easily for other $n$ . The Question: Why does Rudin choose $x = 1/(p + 2)$ specifically?  Is it just to make the expressions work out clearly algebraically?  Why doesn't he comment on his particular choice or the nature of the set of solutions that will work for the proof?

If each person in a group of n people is a friend of at least half the people in the group, then show that it is possible to seat the n people in a circle so that everyone sits next to friends only. My idea was to use induction on $n$; if $n$ is odd we can remove a person, note that the remaining $n-1$ people all have at least $n/2$ friends left, use our inductive hypothesis to seat them, and then use the pigeonhole principle to seat the last person. Unfortunately, this doesn't work when $n$ is even because after removing a person, some of the remaining people might have less than $n/2$ friends left.  In fact, my friend who actually participated in the seminar said they had the same issue, but didn't address it because they ran out of time. Is this sort of induction a reasonable approach?

15011,How can I assign weights to coins so that they can be counted in a single weighing?,"I was sorting out the coins in my loose-change jar the other day, and the following thought crossed my head:  Is it possible to deduce the number of each type of coin in this pile by simply weighing them? The coins I were counting were Australian 5c, 10c, 20c and 50c.  According to Wikipedia , they weights are: 5c     2.83 grams
10c    5.65 grams
20c   11.30 grams
50c   15.55 grams But this might be a particularly bad choice of weights for the coins.  Since 565 divides 1130, we can't tell the difference (through weighing) between two 10c coins and one 20c coin.  It seems that two 5c coins and one 10c coin would be hard to distinguish also. So my question is: Question : What would be a better way to designate the weights of these coins so that we could (in most cases) uniquely determine the number of each type of coin in a single weighing? This would be subject to some practical constraints: Each coin is a reasonably light, but not too light (e.g. between 2 and 20 grams). If A and B are two multisets of coins, and A and B have equal weights, then |A| and |B| should be very large (more than is likely to be in a typical jar). The scales do not measure with infinite precision.  Coins are not minted with infinitely accurate weights. The weights of the coins must differ by a reasonable amount (e.g. by at least 3 grams).","['combinatorics', 'number-theory']"

We know the coordinates for the vertex $V$ . The angle must start from the incoming edge ($e_1$) and ends at another edge ($e_2$, $e_3$, $e_4$). Also, the angle must be form in such a way that the face constructed from $e_1$ to $e_2$ must be in counter-close-wise direction. In other words, the face that you construct when you link all the vertexes $V$ in $e_1$ and $e_i$ together, must be a counter clockwise cycle. So in the case below, edge $e_2$ must be picked because the $\theta$ is the smallest. Is there an algorithm that does this elegantly? The few algorithms I devise are just plain ugly and requires a lot of hacks. Update: One method that I think of ( and proposed below ) is to use the cross product for each edge against the incoming edge $e_1$, and get the minimum $\theta_{i}$. i.e., $$e_{1} \times e_{i} = |e_{1}||e_{i}| \sin\, \theta_{i}$$ But the problem of this is it doesn't really work. Consider the following test cases:
$$e_1=(1,0)$$
$$e_2=(-1/\sqrt(2),1/\sqrt(2) )$$
$$e_3=(1/\sqrt(2),-1/\sqrt(2))$$ One would find that $$\theta_2 = -45^o$$

Given a natural number $a$, are there infinitely many natural numbers not of the form $anm \pm m \pm n$, $n, m$ positive natural? I give a proof that for $a=6$ the question is equivalent to the twin prime conjecture so it is known that we don't have any proof. But what about other values of $a$? There are infinitely many twin primes if and only if there are infinitely many natural numbers that are not of the form $6nm \pm n \pm m$. Proof: Every number that is not a multiple of $2$ or $3$ is of the form $6N\pm 1$. So the only pairs that are not divisible by $2$ or $3$ are $(6N-1,6N+1)$ for any $N$. Now are there infinitely many such prime pairs (twin primes)? If the number $6N-1$ is prime it should not be written as a product of some numbers $6n+1,6m-1$ for any $n,m > 0$. So $(6n+1)(6m-1)=6(6nm-n+m)-1$, which means that $N$ should not be of the form $6nm-n+m$ for any $n,m>0$. Similarly, if $6N+1$ is a prime it should not be a product of some numbers $(6n-1)(6m-1) =6(6nm-n-m)+1$, or $(6n+1)(6m+1) =6(6nm+n+m)+1$.

15141,Expressing bitwise operations in terms of other functions,"I'm asking in the spirit of these two questions : can bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR) be expressed in terms of other (more familiar?) functions? I had been playing around with the bitwise operations in Mathematica a while back, and was at first struck by this identity for bitwise NOT: ~ n == -1 - n (I'll use C-ish notation/syntax for this question, but I'm using Mathematica 's definitions , which assume a two's complement representation for negative integers.) Try as I might, I have not managed to figure out alternative ways of expressing the other bitwise operations. I have also tried Using The Fabulous Search Engine to see if other people have looked into this, but I probably am not using the right keywords. I have noticed that the implementation of the bitwise operators in Mathematica satisfies de Morgan's theorem : i | j == -1 - ((-1 - i) & (-1 - j))

i & j == -1 - ((-1 - i) | (-1 - j)) and the following identity for bitwise XOR is satisfied as well: i ^ j == (i | j) & (-1 - (i & j)) I suppose then that any alternate expression for the bitwise operators would have to satisfy these identities as well. (I am not intending to replace the bitwise expressions in actual programming, of course; they are already optimized, and there is really no practical reason to replace them with ""more mathematical"" expressions. I am asking merely for curiosity's sake.) References and sundry information will be appreciated.",['functions']
15143,Does the method for solving exact DEs generalize like this?,"Differential equations of the form $M\,dx+N\,dy=0$ such that $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$ are said to be exact , because the left hand side of our equation is the exact differential of some function f , and the DE has a solution of the form $f(x,y)=c$, where c is a constant. Standard textbooks give us a procedure for solving such equations that essentially amounts to using the identity  $f=\int\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\: dx+\int(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\int\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\: dx)\: dy$. Specifically, we integrate M (respectively N, &c. ) with respect to x to get $f=\int\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\: dx+C(y)$, and then differentiate this with respect to y and do algebra to find C'(y) , which we can then integrate to find C(y) , which we can substitute back into our expression for f . It occurred to me that this technique should generalize---that is, when instead of $M\,dx+N\,dy=0$  such that $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$, we have $\sum_{i}M_{i}\,dx_{i}=0$ where the $M_{i}$ satisfy the criteria for being an exact differential, then we can iteratively apply the same procedure to solve the equation. And so I came up with the following--- Theorem (?). A differential equation of the form $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}=0$ for some function f has an implicit solution of the form $f=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=c$ where $a_{0}=0$, $a_{i}=\int\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}-\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}a_{j}\right)\right)\: dx_{i}$ for $i\in\mathbb{N}_{+}$, and c is an arbitrary constant. Proof (?). By induction on the number of variables n . The theorem is true for n =1 because $f=\int\,(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}-0)\,dx$ by the fundamental theorem of calculus. To complete the induction, we need to show that if $f(x_{1},...,x_{n})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=c$
is a solution to $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}=0$, then $f(x_{1},...,x_{n+1})=\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}a_{i}=c$ is a solution to $\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}=0$. Think of $f(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ as being the ""special case"" of $f(x_{1},...,x_{n+1})$ where $x_{n+1}$ is being ""treated like a constant."" (My thinking here is not nearly as precise as it should be and I'm overloading the function name f , but hopefully you understand the intuition to which I am appealing.) So we can say that $f(x_{1},...,x_{n+1})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}+C(x_{n+1})$. Then we proceed analogously as in the two-variable case. Differentiating by $x_{n+1}$ and applying algebra yields $C'(x_{n+1})=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n+1}}-\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{n+1}}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\right)$, and then integrating with respect to $x_{n+1}$ yields $C(x_{n+1})=\int\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n+1}}-\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n+1}}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\right)\right)\: dx_{n+1}$. Then substituting into our earlier expression for $f(x_{1},...,x_{n+1})$ we get $f(x_{1},...,x_{n+1})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}+\int\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n+1}}-\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n+1}}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\right)\right)\: dx_{n+1}$, which by virtue of the definition of $a_{i}$ is equivalent to $f(x_{1},...,x_{n+1})=\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}a_{i}$. But by the principle of induction, this is quod erat demonstrandum . Example . In the n =3 case (and naming our variables x, y, and z), we get $f(x,y,z)=\int\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\: dx+\int(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\int\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\: dx)\: dy$
$+\int(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(\int\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\: dx+\int(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\int\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\: dx)\: dy))\, dz$, which is seen to be an identity by performing the integrations. What's going on is that $a_{1}=\int\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\: dx=f$, and all following terms are zero by design, e.g. , $a_{2}=f-f$. So my question is (and I offer my sincerest apologies if this is not an appropriate question, or if my poor exposition has rendered my intentions virtually unreadable) does this seem basically correct , or am I doing something wrong? And how do I fix my sloppy reasoning in the inductive step (""special case"" ... ""treated like a constant"")? I would be much obliged for any input.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

15194,The arithmetic-geometric mean for symmetric positive definite matrices,"A while back, I wanted to see if the notion of the arithmetic-geometric mean could be extended to a pair of symmetric positive definite matrices. (I considered positive definite matrices only since the notion of the matrix square root is a bit intricate for other kinds of matrices.) I expected that some complications would arise since, unlike scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication is noncommutative. Another complication would be that the product of two symmetric matrices need not be symmetric (though the positive definiteness is retained, so one can still speak of a principal matrix square root). By analogy with the scalar AGM, I considered the iteration $$\mathbf A_0=\mathbf A \; ; \; \mathbf B_0=\mathbf B$$ $$\mathbf A_{i+1}=\frac12(\mathbf A_i+\mathbf B_i) \; ; \; \mathbf B_{i+1}=\sqrt{\mathbf A_i \mathbf B_i}$$ I cranked up a short Mathematica routine: matAGM[u_, v_] := First[FixedPoint[
      {Apply[Plus, #]/2, MatrixPower[Apply[Dot, #], 1/2]} &, {u, v}]] /;
      MatrixQ[u, InexactNumberQ] && MatrixQ[v, InexactNumberQ] and decided to try it out on randomly generated SPD matrices. (A numerical note: Mathematica uses the numerically stable Schur decomposition in computing matrix functions like the matrix square root.) I found that for all of the randomly generated pairs of SPD matrices I tried, the process was convergent (though the rate of convergence is apparently not as fast as the scalar AGM). As expected, the order matters: matAGM[A, B] and matAGM[B, A] are usually not equal (and both results are unsymmetric ) unless A and B commute (for the special case of diagonal A and B , the result is the diagonal matrix whose entries are the arithmetic-geometric means of the corresponding entries of the pair.) I now have three questions: How do I prove or disprove that this process converges for any pair of SPD matrices? If it is convergent, what is the rate of convergence? Is there any relationship between matAGM[A, B] and matAGM[B, A] if the two matrices A and B do not commute? Is there any relationship between this matrix arithmetic-geometric mean and the usual scalar arithmetic-geometric mean? Would, say, arithmetic-geometric means of the eigenvalues of the two matrices have anything to do with this? (added 8/12/2011) More digging around has me convinced that I should indeed be considering the formulation of the geometric mean by Pusz and Woronowicz : $$\mathbf A\#\mathbf B=\mathbf A^{1/2}(\mathbf A^{-1/2}\mathbf B\mathbf A^{-1/2})^{1/2}\mathbf A^{1/2}$$ as more natural; the proof of convergence is then simplified, as shown in the article Willie linked to. However, I'm still wondering why the original ""unnatural"" formulation seems to be convergent (or else, I'd like to see a pair of SPD matrices that cause trouble for the unnatural iteration). I am also interested in how elliptic integrals might crop up in here, just as they did for the scalar version of the AGM.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

where $\displaystyle 0\lt \alpha \lt 1$ and $\displaystyle i=\sqrt{-1}$. ${\bf Edit.}$ As Willie Wong shows below, the correct equation is 
$$\left |\int\limits_1^N e^{ix^\alpha} \ \text{dx} \right| = \mathcal{O}(N^{1-\alpha}).$$","['integration', 'analysis']"
15360,Does the integral test work on higher dimensions?,"The integral test of convergence states that, if $f:[1,+\infty)\to[0,+\infty)$ is a monotonically decreasing nonnegative function, then the series $\sum_1^\infty f(n)$ converges iff $\int_1^\infty f(n) dn$ is finite. Is the high-dimensional generalization also true? That is, given $f:[1,+\infty)^N \to[0,+\infty)$, and $f(\dotsc,n_i,\dotsc) \ge f(\dotsc,n_i+\epsilon,\dotsc)$ for all $1\le i\le N$ and $n_i\in[1,+\infty)$ and $\epsilon>0$, then the sum
$$ \sum_{n_1=1}^\infty  \cdots \sum_{n_N=1}^\infty f(n_1,\dotsc,n_N) $$
converges iff the multiple integral
$$ \int_1^\infty \cdots \int_1^\infty f(n_1,\dotsc,n_N) dn_1 \dotsm dn_N $$
is finite. (This is just for checking if my answer over physics.SE is reasonable.)","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
15366,Spreading points in the unit interval to maximize the product of pairwise distances,"This is prompted by question 15312 , but moved to the reals.  It must be solved already.  Pick n points $x_i \in [0,1]$ to maximize $\prod_{i < j} (x_i - x_j)$.  A little playing shows you don't want them evenly distributed-they need to push out to the ends.  With four points, Alpha says to use $\{0,\frac{1}{2}\pm\frac{1}{2\sqrt{5}},1\}$ and with five, $\{0,\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{\frac{3}{7}}}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{\frac{3}{7}}}{2},1\}$","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"
15371,Using the second principle of finite induction to prove $a^n -1 = (a-1)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2} + ... + a + 1)$ for all $n \geq 1$,"The hint for this problem is $a^{n+1} - 1 = (a + 1)(a^n - 1) - a(a^{n-1} - 1)$ I see that the problem is true because if you distribute the $a$ and the $-1$ the terms cancel out to equal the left side.  However, since it is telling me to use strong induction I am guessing there is more I am supposed to be doing.  On the hint I can see that it is a true statement, but I am not sure how to use that to prove the equation or how the right side of the hint relates to the right side of the problem.  Also, I do realize that in the case of the hint $n = 1$ would be the special case.","['induction', 'algebra-precalculus']"
15383,Finding standard ellipse characteristics from specific ellipse parametrisation,"I have found the following ellipse representation $(x,y)=(x_0\cos(\theta+d/2),y_0\cos(\theta-d/2))$, $\theta \in [0,2\pi]$. This is a contour of bivariate normal distribution with uneven variances and correlation $\rho=\cos(d)$. I know that this is a rotated ellipse with centre $(0,0)$.

15388,"Uniqueness follows from explicit solution of $\ a + x = b\,$ in a group","I just started real analysis.  I don't have a background in proofs or logic, simply calculus.  So I'm trying to learn more about proofs--so forgive the basic question, please. How do you go about proving this theorem: If $a$ and $b$ are any numbers, then there is one and only one number $x$ such that $a + x=b$.  This number is given by $x=b+(-a)$. First part of the proof I understand--it's simple.  We simply use some axioms and do the following: $a+b-a=b$, which of course is true.  This is just true from plugging in the $b+(-a)$ for $x$. But how about the uniqueness issue?  In my text, it says: $$(a+x)+(-a)=b+(-a)
x=b+(-a)$$ How does this prove uniqueness?  Is this equation essentially saying that the ONLY possible value of $x$ is expressed by $b+(-a)$? How would I have known to set this up as part of the proof if I was asked to prove something is unique? Sorry for the basic question--have to start somewhere.","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'group-theory', 'real-analysis']"
