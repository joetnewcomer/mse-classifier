1169561,Why is a metric space an open subset of itself?,"I've been reading about topology, and I've come across the following: Given a metric space $X$, the entire space $X$ is an open subset of $X$. I'm having some trouble thinking about this. I have a counterexample in mind. Suppose we consider the closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ called $A = [a, b] \in \mathbb{R}$. Isn't $A$ also a metric space? As far as I know, the answer is yes. So, based on the above, $A$ is an open subset of $A$. But, since $a$ and $b$ aren't interior points of $A$, how is $A$ an open subset?

1169684,Does a left-invariant vector field on a complex Lie group preserve holomorphic functions?,"Let $G$ be a (finite-dimensional) complex Lie group, and suppose $f : G \to \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic.  Let $X$ be a left-invariant vector field on $G$.  Must $Xf$ be holomorphic? I think I have a proof, but I feel that I may have missed some subtlety, or overcomplicated matters.  I'm still learning this area and I don't think my intuition is completely calibrated yet.  I would also be happy to see alternate proofs. Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the Lie algebra of $G$, considered as the tangent space of $G$ at the identity $e$.  Then $\mathfrak{g}$ has a complex structure; call it $J$.  Without loss of generality we can assume $X$ is a real vector field, so let $\xi = X(e) \in \mathfrak{g}$. By left-invariance it is sufficient to show $Xf$ is holomorphic at $e$.  Fix a holomorphic system of coordinates $(z^1, \dots, z^n)$ in a neighborhood of $e$.  I claim $\displaystyle \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}_j} f = 0$ at $e$.  Let $\bar{Z}$ be a left-invariant complex vector field with $\bar{Z} = \displaystyle \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}_j} $ at $e$.  Then $\bar{Z}$ is of type (0,1) so we can write $\bar{Z}(e) = \eta + i J \eta$ for some $\eta \in \mathfrak{g}$. Now we have $(\bar{Z}Xf)(e) = (X \bar{Z} f)(e) + ([\bar{Z}, X]f)(e)$.  Since $f$ is holomorphic and $\bar{Z}$ is of type (0,1), $\bar{Z} f = 0$ so the first term vanishes.  The second term equals $[\eta + iJ\eta, \xi]f = ([\eta, \xi] + i J [\eta, \xi]) f$ which also vanishes since $[\eta, \xi] + i J [\eta, \xi]$ is also of type (0,1).","['complex-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'several-complex-variables', 'lie-groups', 'proof-verification']"
1169709,Why first fundamental form?,"Here is an excerpt from the notes we are using: The first fundamental form dictates how one computes dot products of vectors
  tangent to the surface assuming they are expanded according to the basis $\frac{\partial q}{\partial u},\frac{\partial q}{\partial v}$. In particular, we see that while the metric coefficients depend on our parametrization,
  the dot product $\text{I} (X, Y )$ of two tangent vectors remains the same if we change
  parameters. I assume that first fundamental form is really a map from $T_pM \times T_pM\to \text{R}$, but I don't understand what the first part is talking about. Why would we need a matrix to tell us how to perform dot products? I mean, suppose we have vectors $<a,b,c>$ and $<d,e,f>$, we just multiply them term by term, isn't that correct?

1169930,Help me find the flaw in my method for prime counting,"I've been playing around with my own notation for estimating the number of integers relatively prime to a given primorial and I came up with a result that cannot be right. I would appreciate it if someone could help me restate my observations in standard notation and help me understand my mistake. Here's my notation: $H_{p_i}(x)$ = the number of integers less than or equal to $x$ that are relatively prime to $p_i\#$ For example: $H_3(10) = 3 \left\{ 1,5,7 \right\}$ $H_5(30) = 8 \left\{ 1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29 \right\}$ I use this notation because if I assume $p_0 = 1$ and $H_1(x) = x$, I get: $H_{p_i}(x) = H_{p_{i-1}}(x) - H_{p_{i-1}}\left(\left\lfloor\dfrac{x}{p_i}\right\rfloor\right)$ I also use this notation: $p_i\#_{-1} = (p_i -1)(p_{i-1}-1)(p_{i-2}-1)\dots(2-1)$ So that the standard primorial would be: $p_i\#_{0} = p_i\#$ And the number of pairs of $x,x+2$ that are relatively prime to $p_i\#$ and where $x < p_i\#$ is $p_i\#_{-2}$. So, I was reasoning about primorials using my notation as I normally do when I struck upon a simple formula for the lower bound for any $H_{p_i}$ Let me start with $H_2(x)$ which is easy to state in terms of an upper and lower bound: $\dfrac{x}{2} \le H_2(x) \le \dfrac{x+1}{2}$ Now, I would like to come up with a similar expression for $H_3(x)$ which gets overly complicated and unuseful if we approach it in the obvious way. So, I thought about using two different values: $H_{\text{min}\,3}(x)$ and $H_{\text{max}\,3}(x)$ which I derive in a simple way from $H_2(x)$: $H_{3}(x) = H_2(x) - H_2\left(\left\lfloor\dfrac{x}{3}\right\rfloor\right)$ $H_{\text{min}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{x}{2} - \dfrac{\frac{x}{3}-\left\{\frac{x}{3}\right\}+1}{2}$ $H_{\text{max}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{x+1}{2} - \dfrac{\frac{x}{3} -\left\{\frac{x}{3}\right\}}{2}$ so that I get the following upper and lower bounds: $\dfrac{2x-3}{6} \le H_{\text{min}\, 3}(x) \le \dfrac{2x-1}{6}$ $\dfrac{2x+3}{6} \le H_{\text{max}\, 3}(x) \le \dfrac{2x+5}{6}$ where $H_{\text{max}\,3}(x) \ge H_3(x) \ge H_{\text{min}\,3}(x)$ Let: $H_{\text{min}\, \text{low}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{2x-3}{6}$ $H_{\text{min}\, \text{high}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{2x-1}{6}$ $H_{\text{max}\, \text{low}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{2x+3}{6}$ $H_{\text{max}\, \text{high}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{2x+5}{6}$ Then, I have the following: $H_{\text{min}\, p_i}(x) = H_{\text{min}\, \text{low}\, p_{i-1}}(x) - H_{\text{min}\, \text{high}\, p_{i-1}}\left(\left\lfloor\dfrac{x}{p_i}\right\rfloor\right)$ $H_{\text{max}\, p_i}(x) = H_{\text{max}\, \text{high}\, p_{i-1}}(x) - H_{\text{max}\, \text{low}\, p_{i-1}}\left(\left\lfloor\dfrac{x}{p_i}\right\rfloor\right)$ Using induction (see below for my logic), I was able to generalize this to: $\dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}x - p_i(p_{i-1}\#_{-1})}{p_i\#} \le H_{\text{min}\, p_i}(x) \le \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}x - p_i\#_{-1}}{p_i\#}$ $\dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}x + p_i(p_{i-1}\#_{-1})}{p_i\#} \le H_{\text{max}\, p_i}(x) \le \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}x + p_i(p_{i-1}\#_{-1}) + p_i\#_{-1}}{p_i\#}$ Using the results above, I attempt to analyze Legendre's Conjecture : Let $p_i$ be the largest prime less than or equal to $x$ $\pi(x^2 + 2x) - \pi(x^2) = H_{p_i}(x^2 + 2x) - H_{p_i}(x^2) \ge H_{\text{min}\, p_i}(x^2+2x) - H_{\text{max}\, p_i}(x^2)$ $H_{\text{min}\, p_i}(x^2+2x) - H_{\text{max}\, p_i}(x^2) \ge \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}(x^2+2x) - p_i(p_{i-1}\#_{-1})}{p_i\#} - \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}(x^2) + p_i(p_{i-1}\#_{-1}) + p_i\#_{-1}}{p_i\#} =$ $= \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}(x^2+2x -x^2) - (p_i + p_i + [p_i-1])(p_{i-1}\#_{-1})}{p_i\#} =$ $=  \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}(2x) - (3p_i-1)(p_{i-1}\#_{-1})}{p_i\#} > \dfrac{(p_i-1)(2x) - (3p_i-1)}{p_i p_{i-1}}$ $\dfrac{(p_i-1)(2x) - (3p_i-1)}{p_i p_{i-1}} > \dfrac{2x-3}{p_i} \ge \dfrac{2x-3}{x} =2  -\dfrac{3}{x}$ which would suggest that Legendre's Conjecture is true for $x \ge 3$ This result is ridiculous given the primitiveness of my method.

Suppose that at some later time, the probability of each person being alive is $p$, independently of other persons. At that later time, let $A$ be the number of persons that are alive and let $S$ be the number of couples in which both partners are alive. For any number of total surviving persons $a$, find $E[Sâˆ£A=a]$. I don't have the answer to the problem. Here is my proposed solution, can anyone verify whether it is correct. Let $$(S| A= a) = (S_1| A = a) + (S_2| A = a) + ... + (S_m | A = a)$$ Here $(S_i| A = a)$ is a indicator variable indicating whether both members in a couple are alive or not. So the probability of $p(S_i | A = a)$ is given by $$\frac{p(S_i \cap A = a)}{p(A = a)}$$ where the numerator is given by $p^2 {n - 2 \choose a-2}p^{a-2}(1-p)^{n-2-(a-2)}$ and denominator is given by ${n \choose a}p^a(1-p)^{n-a}$. Therefore $E[S_i | A = a]$ is now known to us, and by symmetry all the indicator variables will have same expectation. So we have the final answer as $m \cdot \frac{p(S_i \cap A = a)}{p(A = a)}$.

Moreover, there exists some nonempty open subset $O\subseteq Y$ such that $\dim\pi^{-1}(O) = \dim X -\dim Y$. Some progress: I have shown that $Gx$ is a locally closed subvariety. It is the image of the morphism $\phi_x:G\rightarrow X$ where $g\mapsto gx$, thus a union of locally closed sets. Therefore it contains a subset $U$ which is dense and open in $\overline{Gx}$. Since the set GU = $\bigcap_{g\in G} gU$ is contained in $Gx$, but invariant under $G$ we have $Gx = GU$, which is open in $\overline{Gx}$.

Let $\mu$ be a positive number  such that $\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} x^{\mu}f(x)$ exists. If $\mu > 1 $ , then $\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x)dx$ converges. If $ \mu \leq 1 $ , then $\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x)dx$ diverges. My proof: $\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} x^{\mu}f(x) =L $ then for suitable $\epsilon >0$ we will get $x_{0} $ such that $(-L+\epsilon)< |x|^{\mu}|f(x)| < (L- \epsilon)$ for $x>x_{0}$ . This will lead to to $|f(x)| < (L- \epsilon)|x|^{-\mu}$ then using comparison test we will get as $\mu$ >1 $\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x)dx$ converges absolutely. But this proof cannot be used for discussing divergence. Even though we use left inequality $|x|^{-\mu}(-L+\epsilon)< |f(x)|$ . There are two problems I felt. One is comparison test is applicable for positive functions. $|x|^{-\mu}(-L+\epsilon)$ need not be positive. Can we solve this problem  by taking out $(-L+\epsilon)$ ? Second problem is this: Even though we got for $\mu \leq 1$ this integral diverge  by comparison test we get $\int_{a}^{\infty} |f(x)|dx$ diverges.

Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertible sheaf on X.
  (a) If $\text{deg}\mathcal{L}\geq2g$, then $\mathcal{L}$ is generated by its global sections. The proof goes as follows: We may suppose that $k$ is algebraically closed, and $\mathcal{O}_X(D)\simeq \mathcal{L}$ for a divisor $D$ on $X$. We then can show that 
\begin{equation}l(D-E)=l(D)-\text{deg}E  \end{equation}
for all effective divisors $E$ such that $\text{deg}E\leq 1$. Liu then mentions that $\mathbf{\text{in particular, }l(D)\neq 0\text{, so by linear equivalence } D\geq 0}$ . The claim should then follow by Lemma 4.2., so I follow its proof applied to my problem to deduce the claim: For all closed points $x\in X$, we should have $\mathcal{O}_X(D-x)_x=\mathfrak{m}_x\mathcal{O}_X(D)_x$. Further, since all closed $x\in X$ are effective divisor of degree 1, we have $l(D-x)<l(D)$. Consequently, we find an $s\in H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(D))\setminus H^0(X,\mathcal{O}(D-x))$. Thus, $s_x\notin \mathcal{O}_X(D-x)_x$ so $s_x$ is a generator of $\mathcal{O}(D)_x$. $\textbf{My question}$: Where do I need the information $D\geq 0$ that Liu was deducing in the proof of the proposition? $\textbf{Lemma 4.2. }$ Let $X$ be a projective curve over a field $k$ and let $D$ be an effective divisor on $X$ with support in the regular locus of $X$.

What is the answer for arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $m \in \{0, \dots, n\}$? What is the answer for $n=30, m=4$? Background of the question This is the background of my question. Is it not necessary to understand it / answer it. I have developed a symbol recognition application (see http://write-math.com ) and I am now thinking about different possibilities to extend it to formula recognition. One part of formula recognition is to recognize the single symbols. I get on-line data, that means I get the information how the symbol is written (in contrast to off-line data, where you only have pixels). My data is a list of strokes, where each stroke is a point. A point has x/y coordinates and a time: [[(x=12, y=21, t=0), (x=7, y=13, t=3), ((x=7, y= 21, t=5), ...],
 [(x=0, y=0, t=6)],
 [...], ...] Now I know that people always segment their symbols perfectly. That means a symbol can have multiple strokes, but one stroke always belongs to exactly one symbol. As I have one recognizer for symbols which works fairly well, it would be possible to simply use it to recognize multiple symbols by trying every possible segmentation. This can be modeled by taking a $n$-bit string for $n+1$ strokes. If a given bit is 0, then the neighboring strokes are connected: stroke1   stroke2   stroke3
        0         1

Stroke1 and stroke2 are connected, but separated from stroke3
Hence the first symbol has the first 2 strokes,
the second symbol has the last stroke I know that symbols with more than 4 strokes are very rare. So rare in fact, that I don't use any stroke after the 4th stroke for recognition. Hence I don't need to check $2^n$ segmentation, but less. My question is how many segementations I have to check.","['recreational-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

According to Durrett (ISBN-10:1461436141), $X_n$ is a Markov chain with transition matrix $p(i,j)$ if for any $j, i, i_{n-1}, \ldots, i_0$:
$$P(X_{n+1}=j \mid X_n=i, X_{n-1}=i_{n-1}, \ldots, X_0=i_0)=p(i,j)$$ It seems to me that this property can never be satisfied. For example, suppose the transition matrix: \begin{array}{c|ccc}
  & a & b & c \\ \hline
a & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
b & 0.5 & 0 & 0.5 \\
c & 0 & 1 & 0 
\end{array} which is graphically represented as: $P(X_3=c \vert X_2=b, X_1=b)=0 \neq p(b,c)=0.5$.  I can similarly do this to any chain and have every probability be equal to $0$.
Is this because I'm conditioning on an event with 0 probability?  Or is it because I should be saying
$$\sum_{x \in \{a,b,c\}} P(X_3=c \mid X_2=b, X_1=x)=0.5=p(b,c)$$ Or am I just thinking about it completely wrong?","['stochastic-processes', 'markov-chains', 'markov-process', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

His paper is here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0765 . [Note that he refers to $J_p$ unconventionally as $M_p$; everybody, including all the papers he cites, calls this set $J_p$.] A lemma from within reads Lemma 2. If $a$, $b$, $c$ are three distinct elements of $J_p$ with $a < b$ and $c - b \equiv 0$ (mod $p$) then $$c - b + a \in J_p.$$ Immediately after the proof of the lemma, the argument becomes hard to follow: Let us suppose, now, that $J_p$ is infinite. Then at least one residue class in $J_p/(p^2-p)$ is infinite; let $a$ be the smallest positive integer in such a class es . $p^2-p$ belongs to $J_p$, so, by Lemma 2, we have that $$a + (p^2-p)\mathbf{N} \subseteq J_p\tag{1}$$
  holds, and by applying Lemma 2 again, $$(p^2-p)\mathbf{N}\subseteq J_p.\tag{2}$$ Let's pick this apart. An infinite subset of $\mathbf{Z}$ modulo any nonzero integer will split into finitely many classes, so they can't all be finite. Thus, at least one residue class of $J_p$ modulo $p^2-p$ is infinite: pick one such class and call it $S$. Let $a = \min S$. The fact that $p^2 - p$ belongs to $J_p$ is a theorem of Eswarathasan and Levine. So far, so good. Questions. Why is (1) true?

1171121,The canonical height of a point on an elliptic curve,"I am struggling with exercise 3.3 in Silverman-Tate Rational Points on Elliptic Curves . Here is the paraphrased problem with necessary background: Let $C:y^2 = x^3 + a x + b$ be a nonsingular cubic and let $P=(x,y)\in C(\mathbb{Q})$ be a rational point on the curve. We define the height $h (P)$ of $P$ to be $h (P) = \log\max\left\{ \left\vert m \right\vert , \left\vert n \right\vert \right\}$ where $x = m/n$ is in lowest terms. Prove that the limit
$$\hat{h} (P) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{h(2^n P)}{4^n}$$
exists (this is the canonical height of $P$). My attempt is to prove the sequence $a_n = 4^{-n} h(2^n P)$ is Cauchy, so take $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ and WLOG assume $m\leq n$. We proved in the text that for any point $P_0 \in C(\mathbb{Q})$ there exists a constant $\kappa_0 = \kappa_0 (P_0, a, b)$ such that for all points $Q\in C(\mathbb{Q})$ we have a bound $h(Q+P_0) \leq 2 h(Q) + \kappa_0$. Using this idea we can bound the height of $2^n P$ in terms of $2^m P$ by splitting up $2^n P$ as a sum of terms of the form $2^r P$, where $r$ decreases from $n$ to $m$. This introduces new constants $\kappa_r$ but since there are only finitely many of them we can take a maximum and not be too hindered: $$h(2^n P)=h(2^{n-1}P + 2^{n-1} P)\leq 2 h(2^{n-1} P) + \kappa_0 = 2 h(2^{n-2}P + 2^{n-2} P) + \kappa_0$$
$$\leq 4 h(2^{n-2} P) + 2 \kappa_1 + \kappa_0 \leq \dots$$ $$\dots\leq 2^{n-m} h (2^m P) + \sum_{r=0}^{n-m-1} 2^r \kappa_r$$ Set $\kappa^* = \max\left\{\kappa_r : 0\leq r \leq n-m-1\right\}$. (Note that $\kappa^*$ depends on $m$ and $n$.) Then we have $$h (2^n P)\leq 2^{n-m} h(2^m P) + (2^{n-m}-1)\kappa^*$$ Therefore $$ a_n - a_m \leq \frac{2^{-m} - 2^{- n}}{2^n} (h(2^m P)+\kappa^*)$$ We also proved in the chapter that there exists a constant $\mu=\mu(a,b)$ ( not depending on $P$) such that $h(2 P)\geq 4 h(P) - \mu$. If we then apply this to bound $h(2^n P)$ from below in terms of $h(2^m P)$ and $\mu$, we obtain a similar recurrence as above, which (assuming I have calculated correctly) gives $$h(2^n P)\geq 4^{n-m} h (2^m P) - \frac{4^{n-m}-1}{3} \mu$$ Therefore we have the bounds $$-\frac{4^{-m}-4^{-n}}{3}\mu \leq a_n - a_m \leq \frac{2^{-m} - 2^{ -n}}{2^n} (h(2^m P)+ \kappa^*)$$ So
$$\left\vert a_n - a_m \right\vert \leq \max\left\{ \left\vert \frac{4^{-m}-4^{-n}}{3} \mu \right\vert , \left\vert \frac{2^{-m} - 2^{ -n}}{2^n} (h(2^m P)+ \kappa^*) \right\vert \right\}$$ $$ \leq (4^{-m} - 4^{-n}) \max\left\{ \frac{\left\vert \mu\right\vert }{3} , \left\vert h(2^m P)+ \kappa^* \right\vert \right\}$$ But I don't know where to go from here since I don't know what happens to  $h(2^m P) + \kappa^*$ as $m,n\rightarrow\infty$, because $\kappa^*$ depends on $n$. We could of course apply the same procedure to $h(2^m P)$ to bound it above in terms of $h(P)$ and terms depending on $m$ and $n$, but I have not found this to be particularly helpful.

1171142,"$X$ compact Hausdorff space, characterize the maximal ideals of $C(X)$","I know this question has been asked before, but I think I'm very close to a new solution and wanted to know if it is a viable approach. Let $C(X)$ be the ring of continuous functions $X \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ where $X$ is compact Hausdorff, and let $\mathfrak M$ be a maximal ideal.  We want to show that $\mathfrak M = I_{x_0} = \{ f \in C(X) : f(x_0) = 0\}$ for some $x_0$. For each nonempty closed set $A$, we define the ideal $I_A = \{ f \in C(X) : f(x) = 0, \forall x \in A\}$.  Clearly $A \subset B$ implies $I_B \subset I_A$ (I also need to show that $I_B \subseteq I_A$ implies $A \subseteq B$, which I haven't done yet).  We let $\mathcal S$ be the set of ideals $I_A$ which are contained in $\mathfrak M$ . An ascending chain $I_{A_i} \in \mathcal S$ corresponds to a descending chain of closed sets $A_i$, whose intersection is nonempty because $X$ is compact.  Thus the union $J$ of the chain $I_{A_i}$ is an ideal which is contained in $I_{\bigcap A_i}$ (now we have to show that $I_{\bigcap A_i} \subseteq \mathfrak M$ to show that it is an upper bound for the chain, I haven't been able to do this). So by Zorn's Lemma, $\mathcal S$ has a maximal element $I_D$ for some nonempty closed set $D$.  Now, I just want to show that $D$ is a singleton set $\{x_0\}$; then $I_D$ is a maximal ideal contained in $\mathfrak M$, whence $I_D = \mathfrak M$.  That will finish the proof. Edit: Assuming I can fix the holes, I finished the problem (answered below). Current problems with the proof: (i) Need to show that $I_B \subseteq I_A$ implies $A \subseteq B$. (ii) Need to finish the Zorn's lemma argument by showing that $I_{\bigcap\limits_i A_i} \subseteq \mathfrak M$. Second edit: (i) follows from the Urysohn lemma.  A compact Hausdorff space is normal.  If $x \in A$, but not in $B$, then $\{x\}$ and $B$ are disjoint closed sets, so by Urysohn there exists a continuous function $f: X \rightarrow [0,1] \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ for which $f(x) = 1$ and $f(b) = 0$ for all $b \in B$.  Thus $f \in I_B$, but not in $I_A$.  So there is only one hole in the proof left. Third edit: (ii) also follows from the Urysohn lemma.

The first part of the problem itself, makes sense. I'm unsure on the steps needed to prove this though.
The second part for (1), would I want to use induction to show that it keeps getting closer to 2 but never reaches it. For part (2), I may be way off, but as simple as plugging into the contractive condition above? I am confused on part 3. A lot here, I appreciate any sort of help.

1171316,Why hasn't the median function made the mean (effectively) obsolete?,"I've learned in my AP statistics class that means can really only be used on nearly-normal distributions, but I know that many studies, experiments, etc. don't always give that perfect normal curve that one might find on a histogram. Why use medians? To my knowledge medians are a good averaging function because they are able to eliminate outliers. Consider finding the averages of the amount of money a person makes in a career. Typically, the curve would be skewed and there would be leveraging points (such as the high amount of money people with executive positions in a career would be making). Point: Medians are Means I've noticed that as a data-set becomes more and more normal, or 'better' suited for the use of a mean, the median approaches the value of the mean. If the median takes care of outliers and skewed data and embodies the value of the mean when it meets the 'conditions' of the mean, Why isn't the median always favored over the mean? (especially with the influx of computer based averaging solutions that would effectively eliminate the issue of efficiency of calculation for either averaging function)","['statistics', 'means', 'median']"

My intuition wants to say yes, but then I know funky stuff goes down with sums, products, intersections, unions and the likes when they deal with infinity. When dealing with a situation like this I would probably inductively show the partial sums have a positive difference, then assume that the limits of the series must have a positive difference too.

1171623,a question about the proof of theorem 5.3 of Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry,"This is on page 33 of Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry . Let $Y$ be an affine variety, and Sing $Y$ be the set of singular points of $Y$. Suppose we already know that Sing $Y$ is a close subset of $Y$, now we need to show that $X := Y -$Sing $Y$, which is an open subset of $Y$, is not empty. In order to do this, the author considers a hypersurface in $\mathbb P^n$ which is birationally equivalent to $Y$. Since birational varieties have isomorphic open subsets, we reduce to the case of a hypersurface. I have three questions about this. As in Corollary 4.5(i)(ii) of this same book, two varieties are birationally equivalent if and only if they each contains one nonempty open subsets isomorphic to each other. Does this mean the existence of an isomorphism correspondence between all the open subsets of the two varieties? Another question is, let $Y,Y'$ be birationally equivalent varieties, and $X = Y -$Sing $Y$, $X'=Y'-$Sing $Y'$, then is it true that $X$ and $X'$ must be isomorphic? Combining with the first question, if the isomorphism correspondence between the open subsets of $Y$ and $Y'$ does exist, does it necessarily corresponds $X$ and $X'$? I think the answer to both of my questions must be negative, since the open subset might be the variety itself. But how can I understand the proof? Why can the author just consider $Y$ as a hypersurface? Thanks.",['algebraic-geometry']
