886070,An arctan problem including a diophantine equation,This is a follow-up question to An equation of the form A + B + C = ABC . I totally messed up with making the equation from the question specification . Actually the question was $$  \arctan(\frac{1}{A}) = \arctan(\frac{1}{B}) + \arctan(\frac{1}{C})$$ So the equation after rearranging becomes $$\frac{1}{A} = \frac{B+C}{BC-1}.$$ Now we have to find the $\min(B+C)$ where A is given to be a fixed positive integer and $B$ and $C$ and are some positive integers which satisfy the equation. I tried some values which satisfy the equation but I don't have enough mathematical background on solving diophantine equations.

886083,Minimum number of out-shuffles required to get back to the start in a pack of $2n$ cards?,"So I'm stuck on this problem. If you perform a faro out-shuffle (i.e. a perfect ""riffle shuffle"" where the top and bottom cards stays in place) on a pack of 52 cards ($n=26$), you can get back the original order in 8 shuffles. Call $8$ the order for $n=26$. That's easily seen if you write the permutation in cycle notation. I checked the order for $n=1$ all the way to $n=26$. I looked for some pattern, but I found none. So my question is, is there a general formula to determine order for any arbitrary $n$? I'd be much obliged if someone could point me in the right direction.

So every element of $\mathbb{R_k}$ can be expressed as a union of open intervals. But, we can express  any open interval as a union of intervals of the form $[x,b)$ as we have done in the beginning .

To say that $X=\mathcal V(I)$ for some ideal generated by its intersection with $K[X_1, ... ,X_n]$ is not to say that $\mathcal I(X)$ has this property. Can someone give a example of the phenomena?

886175,Why are morphisms of schemes locally given by ring homomorphisms?,"I am trying to prove the statement: A morphism $f:Y \rightarrow X$ of schemes is determined locally by homomorphisms of rings.

There is also an affine neighborhood $V = \mathrm{Spec}\: B \subset f^{-1}(U)$ containing $y$ . Restricting the map $f$ we have a map $f:V \rightarrow U$ which is determined by the corresponding ring homomorphism $f^* : A \rightarrow B$ . So we have shown that for any point in $Y$ there is a neighborhood on which the map is determined by a map of rings. Is this ok? I think I have confused myself pretty badly.

886180,Formal approach to (countable) prisoners and hats problem.,"I've found this nice puzzle about AC (I'm referring to the countable infinite case, with two colors). The puzzle has been discussed before on math.SE, but I can't find any description of what is happening from a formal point of view. I'm not really into probability theory, therefore I apologize in advance if I do any mistake or if I can't understand something which is obvious. In particular, I don't know much about infinite sequences of random variables. Intuitively, the solution is quite paradoxical, and this seems to be the reason: it seems that each prisoner has 50% chance to go free and 50% chance to be killed and nothing (i.e. no strategy) can change this probability , since each prisoner gets no data about his hat from the others and from ""the environment"". Furthermore, every prisoner's guess is independent from the others. Thus, for the way we intuitively think about probability, it seems that the expected value of prisoners going free should be ""a half of $\mathbb N$ "" (whatever this means). It turns out that (using AC) there exists a strategy which allows all but a finite number of prisoners go free (and for sure this is not ""a half of $\mathbb N$ "", whatever this means). Now, the above intuitive explanation seems really bugged and unclear to me. For example, even the fact that the prisoners can adopt any kind of strategy seems  to me a ""violation of the rules"" (doesn't that change the probability distribution, since the choice is not random anymore?). Therefore I would like to understand what is formally happening. If you look at the comments in that page, it seems that many people are quite confused about a formal explanation (someone writes even about non-standard integers). The only comment which does really make sense to me is Terence Tao's one: This paradox is actually very similar to Banach-Tarski, but involves a violation of additivity of probability rather than additivity of volume. Consider the case of a finite number $N$ of prisoners, with each hat being assigned independently at random. Your intuition in this case is correct: each prisoner has only a 50% chance of going free. If we sum this probability over all the prisoners and use Fubini’s theorem, we conclude that the expected number of prisoners that go free is $N/2$ . So we cannot pull off a trick of the sort described above. If we have an infinite number of prisoners, with the hats assigned randomly (thus, we are working on the Bernoulli space ${\Bbb Z}_2^{\Bbb N}$ ), and one uses the strategy coming from the axiom of choice, then the event $E_j$ that the j^th prisoner does not go free is not measurable, but formally has probability $1/2$ in the sense that $E_j$ and its translate $E_j + e_j$ partition ${\Bbb Z}_2^{\Bbb N}$ where $e_j$ is the j^th basis element, or in more prosaic language, if the j^th prisoner’s hat gets switched, this flips whether the prisoner gets to go free or not. The “paradox” is the fact that while the $E_j$ all seem to have probability $1/2$ , each element of the event space lies in only finitely many of the $E_j$ . This can be seen to violate Fubini’s theorem – if the $E_j$ are all measurable. Of course, the $E_j$ are not measurable, and so one’s intuition on probability should not be trusted here. So, the trick seems to be that we can't expect probability to be $\sigma$ -additive and to measure the probability of every event, at the same time (which seems really similar to Vitali's and Banach-Tarski's arguments).
This explanation makes quite sense to me, but I can't fully understand it. How is the event $E_j$ formally defined? And how is Tao precisely using Fubini's theorem in order to get to a contradiction? Could someone give me a formal definition of $E_j$ and a formal proof which shows that, for every $j \in \Bbb N$ , $E_j$ is not measurable?","['probability-theory', 'puzzle', 'paradoxes', 'axiom-of-choice']"

this inequality I have$$f(x+y)=f(x)+f'(x)y+f''(\xi)\dfrac{y^2}{2}$$
$$f(x-y)=f(x)-f'(x)y+f''(\eta)\dfrac{y^2}{2}$$
then 
$$f(x+y)-f(x-y)=2f'(x)y+\left(f''(\xi)-f''(\eta)\right)\dfrac{y^2}{2}$$
then 
$$2y|f'(x)|=|f(x+y)-f(x-y)-(f''(\xi)-f''(\eta))\dfrac{y^2}{2}|\le 2a+by^2$$

886383,The space $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{Q}_p^*)$ of smooth compactly supported functions on $\mathbb{Q}_p^*$,"Let $p$ be prime. Let $\mathbb{Q}_p^*$ be the multiplicative group of the field of $p$-adic numbers. We call a function $f:\mathbb{Q}_p^*\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ smooth if it is invariant under translation by some open subgroup. Let $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{Q}_p^*)$ be the space of (complex-valued) smooth compactly supported functions on $\mathbb{Q}_p^*$. Equivalently, $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{Q}_p^*)$ is the space of locally constant and compactly supported functions on $\mathbb{Q}_p^*$ (locally constant = continuous relative to the discrete topology on $\mathbb{C}$). I would like to visualize the elements of $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{Q}_p^*)$, and understand how taking their integral works. I thought about it for a while, and I'm looking for someone who is familiar with this to verify what I did (and possibly give some advice). I use the direct product decomposition $\mathbb{Q}_p^*=\langle p\rangle\cdot \mathbb{F}_p^*\cdot(1+p\mathbb{Z}_p)$. So, $\mathbb{Q}_p^*$ is partitioned into countably many cosets of $\mathbb{F}_p^*\cdot(1+p\mathbb{Z}_p)$. Normalize the Haar measure $\mu$ so that $\mu(\mathbb{F}_p^*\cdot(1+p\mathbb{Z}_p))=1$.
Each coset of $\mathbb{F}_p^*\cdot(1+p\mathbb{Z}_p)$ is partitioned into $p-1$ cosets of $1+p\mathbb{Z}_p$ (each of measure $\frac{1}{p-1}$).
Each coset of $1+p\mathbb{Z}_p$ is partitioned into $p$ cosets of $1+p^2\mathbb{Z}_p$ (each of measure $\frac{1}{p(p-1)}$) and so on. This iterated partition has another nice property - From the level of cosets of $1+p\mathbb{Z}_p$ onwards, each part in each level is a $p$-adic ball, and each $p$-adic balls appears as a part in the appropriate level of the iterated partition. That was the topology and Haar measure on $\mathbb{Q}_p^*$. Now, back to $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{Q}_p^*)$. A function $f:\mathbb{Q}_p^*\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is compactly supported exactly when its support is contained in a finite number of cosets of $\mathbb{F}_p^*\cdot(1+p\mathbb{Z}_p)$ (since a compact set is totally bounded and these cosets are open sets). The function $f$ is locally constant if it is a (finite) linear combination of characteristic functions of open sets. So, the conclusion in that a function $f\in C_c(\mathbb{Q}_p^*)$ is, in general, made up in the following way: Choose a finite number of complex numbers for the range: $z_0=0,z_1,\dotsc,z_m\in\mathbb{C}$. Choose a finite number of cosets of $\mathbb{F}_p^*\cdot(1+p\mathbb{Z}_p)$. In each of the chosen cosets, associate each part in the iterated partition of the coset with one of the $z_i$, where a part may be associated with $z_i$ for $i\neq 0$ only if all parts containing it are associated with $z_0=0$. The association of values to parts in the iterated partition defines a linear combination of characteristic functions of open sets. Integrating such function is obvious by the previous discussion of the Haar Measure. My questions are: Main question: Is what I presented correct? Any suggestions? This was a warmup before looking at $C_c^\infty(\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p))$. Any suggestions before going there?","['general-topology', 'measure-theory', 'integration', 'p-adic-number-theory']"

886549,2 player game subtracting perfect squares from a given number,"this is my first question on these forums.  I apologize in advance if I've overlooked a rule or done something wrong.  Unfortunately, I can't remember where I came across this problem, but it's been bothering me for some time.  I'd appreciate any sort of help here. The Question: Two people, $A$ and $B$, are playing a game.  Given some number $N$, $A$ subtracts a perfect square less than or equal to $N$ from $N$.  $B$ then subtracts a perfect square less than the resulting number from that number.  And so on.  The winner is the last person to subtract a number. Determine all $N$ such that $A$ has a winning strategy. An Example: $N=13$; $A$ subtracts $1$, $B$ subtracts $9/4/1$, $A$ subtracts $1/1/9$, $B$ subtracts $1/(1 or 4)/1$, $A$ subtracts $1/(4 or 1)/1$, $B$ subtracts $-*/1/-*$, $A$ subtracts $-/1/-$, $B$ subtracts$-/-*/-$.  Since $A$ can force $B$ to lose regardless of how $B$ plays, $A$ wins. Work I've done so far: We say a number $x$ is a winning number if $A$ has a strategy for winning when $N=x$ and is a losing number if $A$ doesn't have a strategy for winning when $N=x$.  Note that if $x$ is a winning number, then there exists a perfect square $k^2$ such that $x-k^2$ is losing.  Also, if $x$ is a losing number then for any $k^2$, $x-k^2$ is a winning number.  The difference between any $2$ losing numbers can never be a perfect square.  We also note that, if $x-L$ (where $L$ is any losing number less than $x$) isn't a perfect square, then $x$ can't be a winning number.  So, using this I found a recursive means of computing some losing numbers $(0,2,5,7,10,12...)$.  The losing numbers didn't seem to have a pattern, so I figured I'd try showing that there were only a finite number and then bashing through the recursion to find them all.  But as it turns out there are infinitely many losing numbers.  I'm at a dead end here, which probably means I'm overlooking a trick of some sort. Research: I did a google search of something along the lines of ""game subtracting perfect squares"" and didn't find anything helpful.  I also checked a few of the related posts that Stack Exchange had as ""Questions that may have your answer"" and this one looked similar, but it wasn't particularly useful since parity doesn't seem to be very helpful in this problem.  I posted this question on another math forum as well, but I haven't gotten a response.","['combinatorial-game-theory', 'number-theory']"
886555,Deriving cost function using MLE :Why use log function?,"I am learning machine learning from Andrew Ng's open-class notes and coursera.org. I am trying to understand how the cost function for the logistic regression is derived. I will start with the cost function for linear regression and then get to my question with logistic regression. (Btw a similar question was asked here , which answers the question how the derivative of cost function was derived but not the cost function itself.) 1) Linear regression uses the following hypothesis: $$ h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$$ Accordingly, the cost function is defined as: $$J(\theta) = \dfrac {1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^m \left (h_\theta (x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)^2$$ - 2) The logistic regression uses a sigmoid/logistic function which is $ 0 \leq h_\theta (x) \leq 1 $. Defined as : $$
\begin{align*}
& h_\theta (x) =  \dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-(\theta^T x)}} \newline \newline
\end{align*}
$$ Accordingly, our cost function has also changed. However, instead of plugging-in the new h(x) equation directly, we used logarithm. $$
\begin{align*}
& J(\theta) = \dfrac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m Cost(h_\theta(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)}) \newline
& Cost(h_\theta(x),y) = -log(h_\theta(x)) \; & \text{if y = 1} \newline
& Cost(h_\theta(x),y) = -log(1-h_\theta(x)) \; & \text{if y = 0}
\end{align*}
$$ And the new cost function is defined as: $$ J(\theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m [y^{(i)}\log (h_\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\log (1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))]$$ From class notes "".. the more hypothesis is off from y, the larger the cost function output. If our hypothesis is equal to y, then our cost is 0."" It's also mentioned in the class notes that  MLE (maximum-likelihood estimation) is used to derive the logs in the cost function. I can see how logs function and set penalty values until we find the right values, but I don't see how we came to choose them in the cost function.","['statistics', 'regression', 'logarithms', 'machine-learning']"

886597,Reinventing The Wheel - Part 2: The Lebesgue Integral,"Disclaimer After struggling for some time to find an appropriate definition for the notion of integration I came across another attempt for which I would need your help deciding to what extend this can or cannot be reasonable. Context The Lebesgue integral as most of you know can be interpreted as some sort of absolute integrability. Very much the same holds true for the Bochner integral that - being equivalent to the Lebesgue integral - makes this fact even more light up. While studying the concept of summation I noticed similarities of this technique within infinite sums. That is in order to handle infinite sums and their conditional convergence one introduces a Banach space structure. Then by absolute convergence or similar square summability these can be controlled so to guarantee unconditional convergence. However, taking a closer look on the concept of summation itself one understands that these problems merely arise as a missuse of sums by series giving all sort of problems of conditional convergence. So I started wondering is the analogues problem happening within the Lebesgue integral... Starting from sums one might guess that nets can handle the problem (of course one has to be very careful as measures are considered as 'only' countably additive). Now the big problem stands in the middle: If an appropriate concept can give a satisfactory notion of integral what will be the ordering giving nets then? A first try will give the Riemann integral. Passing from halfopen partitions to measurable partitions pathological examples like the Dirichlet function are managed while keeping continuous functions over compact sets integrable. However unbounded functions like the reciprocal squareroot stay untouched. So one has to work harder. Thinking about the problems one understands that there is two conceptual problems, unboundedness of domain and unboundedness of range. The first one can be handled rather easily by first allowing naturally only finite measure spaces as for example in the case of complex measures and then extending by improper integrals by the use of the net of all finite subspaces (not only some sequence). This immediately rules out the possibility to salvage the reciprocal squareroot as an improper integral as other unbounded functions. Now, any way of introducing an ordering on tagged partitions of the domain fails to handle general unbounded functions (a control of unbounded functions taking values in a topological vector space becomes even harder). Another attempt is to introduce a gauge. Though being very very powerful over compact intervals they heavily rely on the compactness of the interval and moreover on the measure space being Borel. So one has hard chance to generalize the gauge integral for example to the situation faced in the spectral theorem. The very much the same problem arises for any kind of gauge integral... So one must find another way to attack unboundedness of the range. A guess then is to of course as Lebesgue already did so somehow partition the range - this time however conceptually similar to the case of summability as described above. Once more said: The idea is to find a concept similar to summability without absolute convergence! Attempt Here comes the second attempt... Let $\Omega$ be a finite measure space and $V$ a topological vector space and $f:\Omega\to V$. Call a triple $\rho:=(S,U;A_s)$ a resolution w.r.t. $f$ with: $S$ a finite subset of $V$, $U$ an open neighborhood of zero and $A_s$ disjoint measurable sets of $\Omega$ if: $A_s\subseteq f^{-1}(U+s)$ $\bigcup_{s\in S}A_s=f^{-1}(U+S)$ (This should not be interpreted as a gauge but rather as a partition.) Introduce an ordering $\rho\leq\rho'$ on the resolutions by: $S\subseteq S'$ $U\supseteq U'$ $f^{-1}(U+S)\subseteq f^{-1}(U'+S')$ (The ordering is directed.) Construct the net of sums by:
$$I(f;\rho):=\sum_{s\in S}\mu(A_s)s$$
(The neighborhood $U$ takes the role of relating measures to vectors.) Define $f$ to be integrable with integral $I(f)$ if:
$$I(f;\rho)\to I(f)$$
(The integral being unique provided $V$ being Hausdorff.) Now these definitions seem horribly complicated but they follow a few simple ideas: The central idea here is to focus on vectors as the major object within the sums also since the integral itself is one, so start with a finite sum of vectors $s\in S$ The problem now is to relate vectors to sets, this is basically done by the neighborhood of zero $U$. Having a topological vector space makes $U+s$ a neighborhood of $s$. The integral of a function should involve the function itself of course, that is the preimage of the function under consideration relates the neighborhoods $U+s$ to measurable subsets $A_s$. The requirement that $U$ be better open becomes evident here. Finally these measurable sets weight the individual summands by their mass $\mu(A_s)$ and closes the circle vector-set-set-number-vector. Here again having a vector space makes it evident to allow/restrict to complex measures rather than positive ones (for nonfinite measure spaces see doscussion in the context) The rest is technicalities... Moreover, these can be interpreted as an approximation by simple functions.
The nice thing in here is that it automatically sorts out bad steps like blocks escaping to infinity or towers blowing up as peaks... Discussion As a first check: Is $f(x)=c$ for some $c\in V$ integrable over $[0,1]$ with integral $I(f)=c\cdot 1=c$? Is $f(x)=x$ integrable over $[0,1]$ with integral $I(f)=\frac12\cdot1^2=\frac12$? Is $f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$ integrable over $[0,1]$ with integral $I(f)=2\cdot\sqrt{1}=2$? Now comes the dry (interesting) part: Does it include simple functions resp. continuous functions over compact sets? Does it include/extend the Riemann integral resp. Lebesgue integral resp. McShane integral? Does it allow convergence theorems resp. the fundamental theorem of calculus? Does it allow computational methods? Etc. ...

We say that $a \in \mathbb{C} \cup \{\infty\}$ is an asymptotic value for $F$ if there exists a continuous curve going from a finite point to infinity such that $F$ tends to $a$ along that curve. Prove that for any non constant entire function $\infty$ is an asymptotic value. I encountered this problem in an old qualifying exam. My thoughts on this are that if we assume that $\infty$ is not an asymptotic value, then for every continuous curve from a finite  point to infinity $F$ tends to some finite value along that curve. One possibility is that $F$ tends to the same finite value in which case $F$ has a finite limit at $\infty$. Hence on the compact set $\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}$, $F$ is bounded. Then we reach the contradiction that $F$ is bounded by Liouville's theorem. The other possibility is that $F$ does not have a limit at $\infty$ but takes on finite values in the neighborhood of $\infty$. In this case, we are probably getting a contradiction from Picard's Great Theorem.

Then for all $i > k$ the homology groups are $H_i(V)=0$. Is the following proof correct? My proof: It can be shown that $V$ is induced by a $k$-dimensional manifold $\bar{V} \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, i.e. $V = q(\bar{V})$, where $q: \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}P^n$ is the quotient map. 
Because of the properties of the quotient map $q$, we can choose $\bar{V} \subset S^n$, where $S^n \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ is the $n$-sphere.
From Theorem 7.1 in John Milnor's book ""Morse Theory"" it follows that for all $i > k$ we have $H_i(\bar{V})=0.$ Consider the map $p: V \rightarrow \bar{V}$ that sends an equivalence class $[x] \in V$ to $p(x) := \frac{x}{|x|} \in \bar{V}$.
The composition of this map with $q$ is the identity on $V$, i.e. $q \circ p = id$.
Hence the induced maps in homology give $q_* \circ p_* =id$, therefore:
$$q_* \circ p_* =id: H_i(V) \stackrel{p_*}{\rightarrow} \underbrace{H_i(\bar{V})}_{=0 \text{, if } i>k} \stackrel{q_*}{\rightarrow} H_i(V)$$

  number and picks a random seat for herself. After this, every single person who get to the theatre sits on his
  seat if its available else chooses any available seat at random.
  Neymar is last to enter the theatre and 99 seats were occupied. What's the probability what Neymar gets to sit in his own seat? The solution was $1/2$, their reasoning being that there are two possibilities, Neymar either gets his seat or not. This seems very flawed thinking to me because nothing says the two possibilities have equal probability. I calculated it as $1/100 + 1/99$, but I think this is still wrong. My reasoning was there are two scenarios which result in Neymar's seat being available, either: Bruna sits in the right seat in which case everyone also sits in their correct seat, this has a $1/100$ chance; or, Bruna sits in the wrong seat and there's a $98/99$ chance it is not Neymar's seat, then the next person has a $97/98$ chance of not sitting in Neymar's seat, and so on. Which gives $98!/99!$ or $1/99$. My confusion lies in the fact that the subsequent people in the second scenario do not always take their seat at random, they only select a random seat if their seat is occupied.

Thank you. I am currently thinking about something : let suppose we deal with planes, as pictured bellow. I want to project a vector $\vec v$ on their intersection line (green line). Each plane is defined by two vector director. If the two planes intersect, they must have a common vector director ($\vec u_1 = \vec u_2 = \vec u$ on the picture). I project $\vec v$ on each subspace, giving $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$. Finally, I project each $\vec v_i$ on $\vec u$, and sum the results. Or equivalently, directly project $\vec v$ onto $\vec u$. Well, it is not quite satisfying as it requires to find $\vec u$, which seems to me to be equivalent to find the intersection, which I don't want.","['vector-spaces', 'geometry']"

Is this still true, if $k$ is no longer algebraically closed, but still a perfect field? In particular, I am interested in the case where $k=\mathbb{R}$.",['algebraic-geometry']

887228,Question about the definition of $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ on real valued functions,"I understood the definition of $\liminf$ and $\limsup$ for sequences well. But there is a little bit of confusion when it comes to functions. If I did learn it correctly, the definition of $\limsup_{x \to l} f(x)$ is given as the following: Let $A(\delta)$ a set with $A(\delta) = \left\{f(x): 0<| x-l | < \delta \right\}$ for each $\delta > 0$. Then it is $\limsup_{x \to l} f(x) = \lim_{\delta \to 0^{-}} \sup A(\delta)$. For a regular limit $\lim_{x \to l}f(x)$ it is not important whether $f$ is defined at $l$ or not. For example let $f(x)$ be a well behaved, continuous function except only at $l$ where it makes a pointwise ""jump"". Then it is $\lim_{x \to l}f(x) = a$ where $a$ is the value which makes $f$ completely continuous if it were $f(l)=a$. My question is whether the same is valid for $\limsup$ and $\liminf$. Let's say that we calculate $\limsup_{x \to l} f(x)$ for the same $f(x)$ which makes a jump at $l$. Since the set $A(\delta)$ at the definition does not cover $0$, $f(l)$ is not included in $A(\delta)$. But since we take the limit of $\sup A(\delta)$s as $\delta$ approaches to $0$, $\limsup$ again becomes $a$ which is equal to $\lim_{x \to l}f(x)$. Is this logic correct here?","['limsup-and-liminf', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

887374,Independence of increments of a pair of independent Brownian motions,"Suppose I have two Brownian motions $X$ and $Y$, which are independent.

While I know that the increments $X(t)-X(s)$ and $X(u)-X(v)$ are independent for any $v < u  \leq s < t$ (by definition), I would like to show that any two increments $X(t) - X(s)$ and $Y(t) - Y(s)$ are independent.

887378,Ways to calculate the spectrum of an operator,"Friends, I am learning some very basic stuff of spectral theory and kind of lost, in some sense. I am trying to find ways to compute the spectra of different operators, when they work and don't work. For example, by applying directly the definitions, I am able to compute the spectrum of the orthogonal projection to be the set $\{0,I\}$. But, in order to find the essential spectrum of some differential operators, say $L=\partial_{xx}+c\partial_{x}+F$ where $F$ is some linearized term of a nonlinear function $f(u)$, I would perform a Fourier transform $\mathfrak{F}(L)$ and calculate the eigenvalues of this operator. (I am not even sure if this is the correct way of doing it.) Other ways are taking different kinds of transforms (which I have no idea; but by talking to some people, I sensed that taking a Laplace transform sometimes works, too!). I think applying directly the definitions would not be possible in at lot of the cases. Can someone give me references for techniques of finding spectra of different operators, when they fail and work? At least, when I see some kind of operator, I would like to know that I have a sense of what to do.
