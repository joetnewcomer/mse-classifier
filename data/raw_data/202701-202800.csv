3996444,Change of Variable finding simple bounds,"I have a very simple problem that I've solved before (and it gave me a lot of trouble then) and I somehow can not come up with the right bound again. In Michael Corral's book he uses a change of variable transformation to make $x = \frac{1}{2}(u+v)$ and $y = \frac{1}{2}(v-u)$ . The original substitutions are: $x - y = u$ $x + y = v$ The bounds on the $x,y$ plane are $(1,0)$ , $(0,1)$ and $x = 1-y$ Setting x to $0$ I can come up with the first bound of $u = -v$ I did so by plugging in $0$ for $x$ and $\frac{1}{2}(v-u)$ for $y$ and set it equal to $u$ i.e. $u = -\frac{1}{2}(v-u)$ It also works simply pluggin in the numbers. But the second bound for when $x = 1-y$ should be $u = v$ When plugging in I always get $0$ (i.e. the u's go away)
or I get $v = 1$ which is a correct line but I have no bound for u on this?
I'm doing something wrong and I'd be so grateful if you could help me out.
I have a total black out here.
I weirdly am super comfortable with polar and spherical substitution bounds but they don't apply here. Thank you very much! Edit: also if someone could recommend a ressource that has lot's of practice for finding these bounds that'd be great!","['multivariable-calculus', 'change-of-variable', 'multiple-integral']"

How many combinations can I order these pens so that there is no sequence of 5 pens with the same color? For instance, the combination RRRRG GGGBB BBRGB is okay because there is no sequence of pens where 5 colors are after each other. The combination RRRRR ... would need to be excluded because 5 red pens are in a row. My initial strategy was to count the total number of combinations to build with these pens and then subtract the total number of combinations where at least 5 colors are in sequence. The total number of combinations: $$\frac{15!}{(5!*5!*5!)} = 756756$$ The issue I am having is how to create all the combinations where 5 colored pens are in order.

3997088,"Contruction of a triangle, knowing one angle and it perimeter. What is the locus of a point which splits the perimeter in two at a specific length?","Building a triangle (ABC) with a fixed perimeter (P) knowing just one angle (Summit A) is not that easy.
Having fixed one adjacent side (segment AB), we know that the sum of both the others sides is a constant (P-|AB|), and so the third summit (C) is on an ellipse whose focuses are A and B, and passing by the point I called “HalfPerimeter”. Now, the problem is that I would like to know the locus of a point dividing the perimeter in two equal or not unequal parts. By tracing it, It appears that if we cut it in two equal parts, the locus of this moving point is the arc of a circle, which we can draw by finding that both the degenerates cases of the triangle are tangent to this circle. And, if we cut it in two unequal parts, the locus of the moving point is another arc, of a larger circle but with the same center. However, I have no idea how to prove that this locus is a circle, nor how to prove that all those circles have the same center. EDIT: A consequence of this (Corollary of the first part), would be that in the following figure, the perimeter of ABC is independent of the position of M (the moving point), and both ABM and AMC have the same perimeter. This become obvious, since AB is tangent to the circle in $T_B$ , AC is tangent in $T_C$ and BC is tangent in M : $|AB|+|BM| = |AB|+|BT_B| = (*) = |AC|+|CT_C| = |AC|+|CM|$ (*) those two are independents of M (But It still doesn't solve the problem with the unequal parts)","['euclidean-geometry', 'locus', 'geometry']"

In my problem, the last digit of any even number is either 0, 2, or 4.

3997190,How would you define $>$ and $<$ on $\mathbb{C}$?,"Is there a way to find out whether complex numbers are greater then or less than another complex number? For numbers like $i$ and $-i$ , it is clear than one is bigger than the other. However, what about numbers like $2+3i$ and $5+2i$ ? Here's what I think. In the real numbers, you measured how big numbers are with their magnitude and direction. If two real numbers pointed in the same direction, the one with the bigger magnitude is bigger, and if two real numbers were pointed in opposite directions, the one facing the positive direction is bigger. So, I tried the same thing for complex numbers. For a complex number $a+bi$ , the positive directions are along the north of $a$ and east of $b$ axes. So, $2+3i \gt -2-3i$ because $2+3i$ goes in both positive directions, while $-2-3i$ goes in both negative directions. Also, $2+3i \gt -2+3i$ because $2+3i$ goes in both positive directions, while $-2-3i$ goes positive in only one direction. You have to compare numbers like $3-5i$ and $-3+6i$ using their magnitudes because they both go in a positive and negative direction. Also, for numbers lying on the axes themselves, you can't compare them unless they are on the same axis.

3997259,Why was Apery's constant believed to be rational?,"Apéry's theorem states that Apéry's constant $\zeta(3) := \sum_{n=0}^\infty n^{-3}$ is irrational. The Wikipedia article claims that this result was ""wholly unexpected"" to the point that the mathematical community initially did not believe it. But for me personally, Apéry's theorem states exactly what I expected. Broadly speaking, I find that almost all ""interesting"" or ""natural"" series have an irrational sum (with pretty much the only exception being geometric series with a rational initial term and common coefficient). Indeed, as this question points out, it's arguably more natural to expect that Apéry's constant is a rational multiple of $\pi^3$ (and therefore irrational). Why was the mathematical community so convinced that Apéry's constant was rational before Apéry published his proof to the contrary? (Note: I don't really care exactly who believed what at the time. What I'm wondering is which mathematical heuristic(s) the community was using to conjecture that Apéry's constant was rational.) Edit: the consensus view of the comments and answer is that the proof was unexpected, but the theorem itself was not. Since the standard usage of the word ""result"" refers to a theorem but not to a particular proof, I have edited the Wikipedia page to change the phrase ""unexpected nature of the result"" to ""unexpected nature of the proof"" in order to clarify the sentence's meaning.","['rationality-testing', 'irrational-numbers', 'sequences-and-series', 'riemann-zeta', 'math-history']"

So to compute $e^{tA}$ I want to proof that $A^{n}$ is equal to the matrix A with the ""diagonal"" of ones moved up n-1 times, which results in $A^{n} = 0$ . I have tried to proof it with induction. So claim: If A $ \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is of the above form, then $A^{n} = 0$ . For n = 2, the 2 x 2 matrix is equal to: \begin{equation*}
A = 
\begin{pmatrix}

3997417,"To check $N\preccurlyeq^+ M$, does it suffice to consider single-variable formulas?","Let $R$ any unital ring, and let $\mathcal{L}_R=\{+,-,0,r\}_{r\in R}$ be the language of left $R$ -modules, where each $r$ is a unary function symbol. Recall that a positive primitive (pp) $\mathcal{L}_R$ -formula is one of the form $\exists\overline{w}\bigwedge_{i=1}^k\overline{r_i}\bullet\overline{v}=\overline{s_i}\bullet\overline{w}$ , where each $\overline{r_i}$ and $\overline{s_i}$ is a tuple of elements of $R$ , and $\bullet$ denotes the ""dot product"". (So, eg, $\overline{r_i}\bullet\overline{v}=\sum_{j=1}^mr_{ij}\cdot v_j$ .) It is well-known that, modulo the complete theory of any $R$ -module, every $\mathcal{L}_R$ -formula is equivalent to a boolean combination of pp-formulas. Given a pair of modules $N\leqslant M$ , we say that $N$ is a pure submodule of $M$ , denoted $N\preccurlyeq^+M$ , if $$N\models\psi(\overline{a})\iff M\models\psi(\overline{a})$$ for any pp-formula $\psi$ and any tuple $\overline{a}\in N$ . (Note that the forward implication always holds, so the content of purity is the backwards implication.) Question: When checking that $N$ is a pure submodule of $M$ , does it suffice to consider pp-formulas in a single variable? $\square$ This seems like a very natural and straightforward question, but the answer is unclear to me. Certainly if $\psi$ is of the form $\exists\overline{w}(\overline{r}\bullet\overline{v}=\overline{s}\bullet\overline{w})$ then the desired implications hold. Indeed, then the sentence $\psi(\overline{a})$ for a tuple $\overline{a}\in N$ is equivalent to the sentence $\psi'(a^1)$ , where $a^1=\overline{r}\bullet\overline{a}\in N$ and $\psi'$ is the single-variable formula $\exists \overline{w}(v=\overline{s}\bullet\overline{w})$ . However, things seem less straightforward if $\psi$ has multiple conjuncts. By a similar argument as above (considering each $\overline{r_i}\bullet\overline{a}$ as a single element of $N$ ), it suffices to consider formulas of the form $\exists\overline{w}\bigwedge_{i=1}^kv_i=\overline{s_i}\bullet\overline{w}$ . Then saying that $N$ is pure in $M$ with respect to formulas in one variable amounts to saying that each equation $a_i=\overline{s_i}\bullet\overline{w}$ has a solution in $N$ if and only if it has a solution in $M$ , for every $a_i\in N$ . But I don't immediately see how we can ""stitch"" these solutions together in the way that we want, and I'm not even sure if we can in general. Does anyone have any thoughts? A counterexample, or a proof for a particularly nice class of ring (PIDs perhaps?), would also be much appreciated. For instance, I believe the result holds if $R$ is a local PID. Sketch: suppose $R$ has maximal ideal $(\pi)$ . Then every element of $R$ is associate with a power of $\pi$ , so we may assume that the length of the tuple $\overline{w}$ in the formula above is $1$ , and that each $s_i$ is of the form $\pi^{n_i}$ for some $n_i$ . Then, assuming wlog that $n_1$ is minimal among the $n_i$ , we have $N\models\exists w\bigwedge_{i=1}^ka_i=\pi^{n_i}w$ if and only if $$\text{(i) }a_1\text{ is divisible by }\pi^{n_1}\text{ in }N\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{  and }\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(ii) }a_i=\pi^{n_i-n_1}a_1\text{ for each }i.$$ Clearly (ii) holds in $N$ if and only if it holds in $M$ , and (i) is covered by the pp-criterion for single variable formulas, and so we are done.","['model-theory', 'logic', 'modules', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

3997583,Catalan numbers using the recurrence.,"A gambler tosses a coin, winning 1\$ on heads and losing 1\$ on tails. We know they got $t$ tails and $k+t$ heads, thus winning $k$ \$. The total ways in which this could have happened is ${2t+k \choose t}$ and the number of ways such that they reached $k$ \$ for the first time on the last toss they made (call this ""the Catalan constraint"") is given by the Catalan numbers: ${2t+k-1 \choose t}-{2t+k-1 \choose t-1}$ . See here: Probability that random walk will reach state $k$ for the first time on step $n$ . Now, let $n(k,t)$ be the number of ways in which they get to $k$ for the first time on toss $2t+k$ (which we know from other means is the generalized Catalan numbers). Then, conditioning on the first toss, we get the recurrence: $$n(k,t)=n(k-1,t)+n(k+1,t-1) \tag{1}$$ Both the total number of paths (total ways of getting to $k$ \$ in $2t+k$ tosses), as well as the paths with the Catalan constraint (ways of getting to $k$ \$ for the first time after $2t+k$ tosses) satisfy the recurrence above. The only difference is in the initial conditions. For both series, we have: $$n(0,0)=1$$ For paths with the Catalan constraint; $$n(0,t)=0 \;\;\forall \;\; t>0$$ While for un-constrained paths; $$n(0,t)={2t \choose t}$$ There must be a way to go from the recurrence in equation (1) to the solutions for the counts of the two kinds of paths (depending on which starting conditions we substitute), using generating functions or other techniques. Is there a way to do this? Note that @robjohn's answer in the question linked above does do this, but he uses the interpretation that these are paths on the grid. I was hoping for a solution that doesn't depend on this intuition and only equation (1) with the starting conditions. Specifying the initial conditions explicitly. In addition to the recurrence given by equation (1) which both series satisfy, we have the following initial conditions: Case-1: Paths that satisfy the Catalan constraint. $$n(0,0)=1$$ $$n(0,t)=0 \forall t>0$$ We know the solution of the recurrence in equation (1) with these initial conditions is: $$n(k,t) = {2t+k-1 \choose t}-{2t+k-1 \choose t-1}$$ Case-2: All paths (no constraint). $$n(0,0)=1$$ $$n(0,t)={2t \choose t} \forall t>0$$ We know the solution of the recurrence in equation (1) with these initial conditions is: $$n(k,t) = {2t+k \choose t}$$","['catalan-numbers', 'combinatorics']"
3997615,What does group theory add to the understanding of error correcting codes?,"I'm learning about group codes. Here's how I understand it (please correct me if I'm wrong): $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$ under xor is an abelian group. $\text{syn}: \mathbb{Z}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_2^n$ , the syndrome function, is a homomorphism. The kernel of this homomorphism is, by definition, the set of codewords. Let's call it $C$ . Being a kernel, it's also a normal subgroup. It can also be shown that $C$ is generated by the rows of the parity check matrix of the code. By the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem, $\mathbb{Z}_2^n / C \cong \text{Im}\ syn$ . So, every coset corresponds to a different syndrome and the elements in a given coset all have the same syndrome. From the item above, it follows that the received message and the error pattern that generated it (from the sent codeword) are in the same coset. Finally, choose the element with smallest number of $1$ s (the coset leader). Let's call it $\mathbf{e}$ . And let's call the received word $\mathbf{r}$ . The codeword to be reconstructed is $\mathbf{e} + \mathbf{r}$ . Now, we can explain the same thing without any reference to group theoretical concepts, and dealing only with matrices instead. Even in the explanation above, we have to use matrices anyway. So it doesn't seem to be adding anything to understanding of this type of code. But, of course, I'm missing something. What is it? Is there any insight we can get by looking at this subject from a group theoretical perspective, that we wouldn't get otherwise?

The latter fact can be shown with a two-step argument: (1) the continuous functions $C([0,1])$ are dense in $L^2(0,1)$ , with $\|f\|_{L^2}\leq\|f\|_{L^\infty}$ ; (2) by Stone-Weierstrass $\mathbb{C}[x]$ is dense in $(C([0,1]),\|\cdot\|_{L^\infty})$ .

(For example: $d\mu(x)=e^{-x^2}dx$ .) In particular, $\mu$ is a finite measure. Thus, $\mathbb{C}[x]\subset L^2(\mathbb{R},d\mu)$ and its closure in the $L^2$ -norm is a closed Hilbert subspace of $L^2(\mathbb{R},d\mu)$ .

Is that true? Can anyone give me an example of lack of density?

3997916,Why is the sine function analytic?,"$\newcommand{\set}[1]{\{#1\}}$ $\newcommand{\norm}[1]{\|#1\|}$ $\newcommand{\R}{\mathbf R}$ Let me define the sine function in the geometric way.
I want to say that the sine of an angle is `perpendicular divided by hypotenuse.'
So first let us define what we mean by an angle. Let $C=\set{(x, y)\in \R^2:\ x^2+y^2=1, 0\leq x, y\leq 1}$ be the part of the unit circle in the first quadrant.
To each point $p$ of $C$ we will associate a numerical quantity $f(p)$ which we will refer to as the angle corresponding to $p$ .
This quantity $f(p)$ is the length of the arc along $C$ joining the points $(1, 0)$ and $p$ .
Then $\sin(f(p))$ is declared to be equal to $p_2$ , the $y$ -coordinate of $p_2$ . So we need to recall the notion of length.
Given a twice differentiable curve $\gamma:[a, b]\to \R^2$ , we define the length of $\gamma$ as $$
\int_a^b \norm{\gamma'(t)}\ dt
$$ Here the norm is the Euclidean norm.
Intuitively, this says that the distance travelled by the particle whose position is governed by $\gamma$ is the integral of its speed, which makes a lot of sense.
It is important to note that one may re-parametrize $\gamma$ and not alter the length.
More precisely, if $\alpha:[c, d] \to [a, b]$ is a diffeomorphism, then $\gamma\circ \alpha$ has the same length as $\gamma$ . Now let us define the notion of angle using this.
We define a map $\gamma:[0, 1]\to \R^2$ as $$\gamma(t) = (1-t, \sqrt{1-(1-t)^2})$$ Note that the usual parameterization of the circle comes from trigonometric functions but we cannot use that since those are what we are trying to define here. We declare that the angle associated to a point $p\in C$ as the length of $\gamma:[0, t_0]\to \R^2$ where $t_0\in [0, 1]$ is the unique element such that $\gamma(t_0)=p$ .
Let us denote the length of $\gamma:[0, 1]\to \R^2$ as $\pi/2$ . Finally, we define the sine function $\sin:[0, \pi/2]\to \R$ by declaring $\sin(a)$ to be the second coordinate of the point in $C$ whose angle is $a$ .
We extend this function to all of $\R$ in the obvious way. It can be showing using geometric arguments that the sine function thus defined is differentiable and its derivative happens to be the cosine function (which we can similarly define as the `base upon hypotenuse' function).
The cosine function itself turns out to be differentiable and its derivate is the negative of the sine function.
Therefore the sine function is smooth. Question. However, it is not clear to me how to show that the sine function, as defined above, is analytic. Can somebody please help me with this.

For any permutation $w\in\mathcal{S}_n$ we denote with $\mathsf{Des}(w)$ the descent set of $w$ , i.e. $$\mathsf{Des}(w)=\left\{ i\in\left[n\right]\mid w\left(i\right)>w\left(i+1\right)\right\} $$ We denote with $A_S$ the set of permutations that corresponds to the natural labelings of $P_S$ , i.e. $$A_{S}=\left\{ w\in\mathcal{S}_{n}\mid w=\left(\omega\left(1\right),\omega\left(2\right),\dots,\omega\left(n\right)\right)\text{ for some natural labeling }\omega\text{ of }P_{S}\right\} $$ The question We want to calculate, for any given $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ the sum of the order polynomials on the subsets $S\subseteq[n-1]$ , i.e. $$\sum_{S\subseteq[n-1]}\Omega\left(P_{S},m\right).$$ My progress It seems that the requested sum is equal to $$m(1+m)^{n-1},$$ but I did not manage to show it. It is not hard to show that the set of all the natural labelings for a given subset $S$ has the same cardinality as the set of all permutations of $[n]$ with descent set equal to $S$ , i.e. $$\#A_S=\#\left\{ \omega\colon P_{S}\to[n]\mid\omega\;\text{natural labeling}\right\} =\#\left\{ w\in\mathcal{S}_{n}\mid\mathsf{Des}\left(w\right)=S\right\} .$$ It is well known that $$\Omega\left(P_{S},m\right)=\sum_{w\in A_{S}}\binom{m+n-\mathsf{des}\left(w\right)-1}{n}.$$ I tried to use these facts in order to calculate the requested sum but I failed...","['order-theory', 'combinatorics', 'combinatorial-proofs']"

Now we consider the fiber $F$ that lies along the equator of the equitorial sphere where $x^4 = 0$ . Now we want to show that any other fibre of the Hopf map can connect any other point in $S^3$ to antipodal points along $E$ . If the point on $S^3$ is $(z_1, z_2$ ) I can use a complex number $\lambda$ in order to 'rotate' the fiber into the plane of $x^4 = 0$ . I really then struggle to understand how this shows that the fibers are linked by following this geometric argument.

3998511,How to construct a chamfered dodecahedron with equilateral or coplanar faces?,"According to wikipedia , ""The chamfered dodecahedron is a convex polyhedron with 80 vertices, 120 edges, and 42 faces: 30 hexagons and 12 pentagons. It is constructed as a chamfer (geometry) (edge-truncation) of a regular dodecahedron. The pentagons are reduced in size and new hexagonal faces are added in place of all the original edges ."" And according to this question , the steps to create a chamfered polyhedron are as follows: shrink the given polyhedron's faces by a factor $r, 0<r<1$ translate the shrunken faces outward [I'll call this distance $s$ ], so that their edges are coplanar with the
original polyhedron's edges construct the required hexagons from the original polyhedron's vertices and the vertices of the shrunk faces. I haven't found any other explicit details regarding the relationship between $r$ and the shape of the hexagons, and so my questions are these (note that the value of $s$ will be directly dependent on the shape of the original face, and so $s$ will need to be represented with some parameter(s) that represent the face's shape somehow): What is the general relationship between $r$ and $s$ in order to get coplanar vertices? Does this relationship change depending on how many times the polyhedron is chamfered? What is the general relationship between $r$ and $s$ in order to get equilateral vertices? Does this relationship change depending on how many times the polyhedron is chamfered? For equilateral and coplanar vertices, what value does $r$ need to be so that the diameter of the resulting hexagon equals the original side length? (ie. given pentagons that share edge $AB$ , the resulting hexagon between the two would have a diameter equal to the length of $AB$ - shown in the images below) I assume this relationship could be obtained by setting up the answers to the previous questions as a system of equations Note that this is different than my question here as it takes a different approach in constructing the chamfered faces - scaling along the relative Z axis vs. translating.","['trigonometry', 'polyhedra', 'geometry', '3d']"
3998634,2nd order nonlinear ODE,"I have to solve the following ODE $$
  \frac{y''}{y'^2} + y'e^y = 0
$$ by finding a function $F(y',y)$ such that its derivative is equal to $\frac{y''}{y'^2} + y'e^y$ , then using initial conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y'(0) = 1$ . What I have done so far is this. Using the multivariable chain rule we can deduce the following: $$
  \frac{d}{dx} \left(F(y',y)\right) = \underbrace{\frac{d}{dx} y'(x)}_{=y''} \cdot \frac{\partial F(y',y)}{\partial y'} + \underbrace{\frac{d}{dx} y(x)}_{=y'} \cdot \frac{\partial F(y',y)}{\partial y}
$$ So by simple comparison we need that $\frac{\partial F(y',y)}{\partial y'} = \frac{1}{y'^2}$ and $\frac{\partial F(y',y)}{\partial y} = e^y$ . Then by integrating both of these equations with respect to either variable $y'$ and $y$ we get $$
\begin{align*}
  &F(y',y) = \int e^y \, dy = e^y + c(y') \\
  &F(y',y) = \int \frac{1}{y'^2} \, dy' = -\frac{1}{y'} + c(y)
\end{align*}
$$ Thus an appropriate function would be $F(y',y) = e^y - \frac{1}{y'} + C$ .
So we have the relationship $$
  \frac{d}{dx} \left(e^y - \frac{1}{y'} + c\right) = 0
$$ Integrating both sides yields $$
  e^y - \frac{1}{y'} + c_1 = c_2
$$ Now if $c_1$ and $c_2$ were zero (or identical), this would be easy to solve using separation but as this is nonlinear and inhomogeneous, I have no idea.","['derivatives', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

Let $K(x)$ be the field of fractions of $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ , i.e. it is the field of germs of meromorphic functions at $x$ . Definition: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf over $X$ , then we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is coherent if for each $x\in X$ there exist a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and an exact sequence \begin{equation*}\mathcal{O}_U^{\oplus q}\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_U^{\oplus p}\rightarrow\mathcal{F}_{|U}\rightarrow 0\end{equation*} for some $p,q>0$ where $\mathcal{O}_U$ is the restriction to $U$ of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on $X$ . In particular the sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ is locally finitely presented.

3999019,When is the restriction of a quotient map $p : X \to Y$ to a retract of $X$ again a quotient map?,"Quite a number of questions in this forum deal with the problem when the restriction $p' : A \stackrel{p}{\to} p(A)$ of a quotient map $p : X \to Y$ to a subspace $A \subset X$ is again a quotient map. An example is The restriction of a quotient map to a saturated closed set is a quotient map . Here the question is Given a quotient map $p : X \to Y$ and a subspace $A \subset X$ . When is the restriction $p \mid_A : A \to Y$ a quotient map? This question occurs in hidden form in the context of projective spaces. Let $\mathbb K = \mathbb R, \mathbb C$ . Then $$\mathbb{KP}^n = (\mathbb K^{n+1} \setminus \{0\})/ \sim$$ where the equivalence relation $\sim$ is defined by $x' \sim x$ if $x' = \lambda x$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb K \setminus \{0\}$ . It is well-known that an alternative representation of $\mathbb{KP}^n$ is $$\mathbb{KP}^n = S(\mathbb K^{n+1}) / \sim$$ where $S(\mathbb K^{n+1})$ denotes the unit sphere in $\mathbb K^{n+1}$ (i.e $S(\mathbb R^{n+1}) = S^n$ , $S(\mathbb C^{n+1}) = S^{2n+1}$ ). This shows in particular that $\mathbb{PK}^n$ is compact. Note that for $\mathbb K = \mathbb R$ the relation $\sim$ restricts to $S^n$ via $x' \sim x$ if $x' = \pm x$ and for $\mathbb K = \mathbb C$ restricts to $S^{2n+1}$ via $x' \sim x$ if $x' = \lambda x$ for some $\lambda \in S^1 \subset \mathbb C$ . The above alternative representation of $\mathbb{KP}^n$ is an obvious consequence of the following fact: Given a map $p : X \to Y$ and a retraction $r : X \to A$ onto a subspace $A \subset X$ such that $p \mid_A \circ \phantom{.} r = p$ . Then $p$ is a quotient map if and only if $p \mid_A : A \to Y$ is a quotient map. The question is to give a proof of this fact to obtain a standard reference in this forum. Note that $S(\mathbb K^{n+1})$ is a retract of $\mathbb K^{n+1} \setminus \{0\}$ ; simply define $r : \mathbb K^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \to S(\mathbb K^{n+1}), r(x) = \dfrac{x}{\lVert x \rVert}$ and note that the quotient map $\pi : \mathbb K^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{KP}^n$ has the property $\pi \mid_{S(\mathbb K^{n+1})} \circ \phantom{.} r = \pi$ .","['general-topology', 'projective-space', 'quotient-spaces']"

I tried to use the power series method: $$y=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n x^n$$ So the equation becomes: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n+2}x^n(n+1)(n+2)-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n x^{n+2}=0$$ Here I need to get both sums to the same power of n, so I removed the first two terms from the first sum, so that I can later change the index: $$2c_2+6c_3x+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_{n+2}x^n(n+1)(n+2)-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n x^{n+2}=0$$ now I change the index in the fist sum: $$2c_2+6c_3x+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}c_{n+4}x^{n+2}(n+4)n(n+3)-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n x^{n+2}=0$$ Now I factor out the sum: $$2c_2+6c_3x+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}x^{n+2}(c_{n+4}(n+4)(n+3)-c_n)=0$$ Now all three terms must be zero at the same time, so $c_2=c_3=0$ , and: $$c_{n+4}(n+4)(n+3)-c_n=0$$ $$c_{n+4}=\frac{c_n}{(n+4)(n+3)}$$ The first terms of the series are: $c_4=\frac{c_0}{4\times 3}$ , $c_8=\frac{c_4}{8\times 7}=\frac{c_0}{8\times 7\times 4\times 3}$ However, I don't really know how to proceed from here.

3999320,Picking pawns from pouch,"You have a pouch containing 4 chess pawns. Your prior knowledge is that the pouch does
not contain exactly 2 black and 2 white pieces. All other proportions of colours are equally
probable (e.g. 3 black and 1 white is equally probable as 4 black pieces). The first piece drawn from the bag is black. What is the probability that the next piece drawn is also black? I tried solving this problem in the following way: The states can be represented by the number of black pieces in the pouch and is then written as: $$B = \{0,1,3,4\}$$ , with probability distribution $$P = \{\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4}\}$$ .
The possible states of a measurement are picking up a black piece or picking up a white one. We denote these states as $$C = \{b, w\}$$ The first measurement has a probability distribution of $$Q = \{q_{b}, q_{w}\} = \{\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\}$$ where we are equally likely to pick up a white or a black piece. This is due to the weighted sum of black and white pieces in the possible states being equal. Let's say we pick a black piece.
Now reevaluate the probabilities of the states $B$ . This can be done by counting in how many ways we could have picked a black piece from each state and weighting the probabilities by that number. $$P|b = \{0,\frac{1}{8},\frac{3}{8},\frac{4}{8}\}$$ From these probabilities we can once again do a weighted sum of black and white pieces. It's a bit more complicated this time so I'll write it out. $$b_{sum} = 0\cdot-1+\frac{1}{8}\cdot 0 +\frac{3}{8}\cdot 2 +\frac{4}{8}\cdot 3 = \frac{18}{8} = \frac{9}{4}$$ $$w_{sum} = 0\cdot4+\frac{1}{8}\cdot 3 +\frac{3}{8}\cdot 1 +\frac{4}{8}\cdot 0 = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}$$ $$Q|b = \{q_b|b, q_w|b\} = \{\frac{b_{sum}}{b_{sum} + w_{sum}}, \frac{w_{sum}}{b_{sum} + w_{sum}}\} = \{\frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{4}\}$$ This result was so unintuitive to me that I had to doubt the logic of my reasoning. I tried redoing the calculations with a bag of pieces where the state of two black and two white was allowed and got a similar result of black being much more likely as the second pick if it was the first.

3999593,Unifying the connections between the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions,"There are many, many connections between the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, some of which are listed here. It is probably too optimistic to expect that a single insight could explain all of these connections, but is there a holistic way of seeing the parallels between $\sin$ and $\sinh$ , $\cos$ and $\cosh$ ? Can all of these seemingly disparate connections be shown to be essentially the same, or at least very similar? Geometric connections Sine and cosine parameterise the unit circle $x^2+y^2=1$ , just as hyperbolic sine and cosine parameterise the 'unit hyperbola' $x^2-y^2=1$ . Both circles and hyperbolas are conic sections . The sector of the circle connecting the points $(0,0)$ , $(1,0)$ , and $(\cos t,\sin t)$ has an area of $t/2$ . The region of the hyperbola connecting the points $(0,0)$ , $(1,0)$ , and $(\cosh t,\sinh t)$ has an area of $t/2$ . This can even be used to define the hyperbolic functions geometrically , and many authors do the same with the trigonometric functions. Sine and hyperbolic sine are odd, whereas cosine and hyperbolic cosine are even. But sine and cosine are periodic functions, unlike the hyperbolic counterparts. The analogue of the identity $\cos^2x+\sin^2x \equiv 1$ is $\cosh^2x-\sinh^2x \equiv 1$ . The compound angle formulae are almost identical to their hyperbolic counterparts, save for a pesky minus sign: \begin{align}
\sin(x+y) &= \sin(x)\cos(y)+\cos(x)\sin(y) \\
\sinh(x+y) &= \sinh(x)\cosh(y) + \cosh(x)\sinh(y) \\[4pt]
\cos(x+y) &= \cos(x)\cos(y) \color{red}{-} \sin(x)\sin(y) \\
\cosh(x+y) &= \cosh(x)\cosh(y) \color{blue}{+} \sinh(x)\sinh(y) \, .
\end{align} In general, given a trigonometric identity, it is (usually) possible to find a corresponding hyperbolic identity using Osborn's rule: replace every occurrence of $\cos$ with $\cosh$ ; replace every occurrence of $\sin$ by $\sinh$ , but negate the product of two $\sinh$ terms. Analytic connections $\sin$ is the unique solution to the initial value problem \begin{align}
f''(x) &= \color{red}{-}f(x) \\
f'(0) &= 1 \\
f(0) &= 0 \, ,
\end{align} and the corresponding initial value problem for $\sinh$ is the same, except $f''(x) = \color{blue}{+}f(x)$ . Likewise, the initial value problem for $\cos$ is \begin{align}
f''(x) &= \color{red}{-}f(x) \\
f'(0) &= 0 \\
f(0) &= 1 \, ,
\end{align} and again we see a mysterious sign change for $\cosh$ : $f''(x) = \color{blue}{+}f(x)$ . It follows that the higher-order derivatives of $\sin$ and $\sinh$ form periodic sequences. If we solve the initial value problems shown above, we obtain the exponential forms of all $4$ functions: \begin{align}
\sin x &= \frac{e^{\color{green}{i}x}-e^{-\color{green}{i}x}}{2\color{green}{i}} \quad{} \cos x = \frac{e^{\color{\green}{i}x}+ e^{-\color{green}{i}x}}{2} \\[3pt]
\sinh x &= \frac{e^{x}-e^{-x}}{2} \quad{} \cosh x = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} \, .
\end{align} All $4$ functions are analytic, and their Taylor series bear a striking resemblance to each other: \begin{align}
\sin x &= x \color{red}{-} \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} \color{red}{-} \frac{x^7}{7!} + \ldots \\[4pt]
\sinh x &= x \color{blue}{+} \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} \color{blue}{+} \frac{x^7}{7!} + \ldots \\[4pt]
\cos x &= 1 \color{red}{-} \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} \color{red}{-} \frac{x^6}{6!} + \ldots \\[4pt]
\cosh x &= 1 \color{blue}{+} \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} \color{blue}{+} \frac{x^6}{6!} + \ldots
\end{align} And Euler's formula $$
e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x
$$ is replaced by the underwhelming $$
e^x = \cosh x + \sinh x \, .

Triangle $DEF$ is also an equilateral triangle and it is inscribed in triangle $ABC \left(D\in BC,E\in AC,F\in AB\right)$ . Find $\cos\measuredangle DEC$ if $AB:DF=8:5$ . Firstly, I would be very grateful if someone can explain to me how I am supposed to draw the diagram. Obviously I have made it by sight. Let $\measuredangle DEC=\alpha$ . We can note that $\triangle AEF \cong \triangle BFD \cong CDE$ . This is something we can always use in such configuration. So $$AE=BF=CD, $$ $$AF=BD=CE.$$ Let $AB=BC=AC=8x$ and $DF=DE=EF=5x$ . If we denote $CD=y,$ then $CE=AC-AE=AC-CD=8x-y$ . Cosine rule on $CED$ gives $$25x^2=(8x-y)^2+y^2-2y\cos60^\circ(8x-y)$$ which is a homogenous equation. I got that $\dfrac{y}{x}=4\pm\sqrt{3}.$ Now using the sine rule on $CED$ $$\dfrac{CD}{DE}=\dfrac{\sin\alpha}{\sin60^\circ}\Rightarrow \sin\alpha=\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{10}\cdot\dfrac{y}{x}=\dfrac{4\sqrt3\pm3}{10}.$$ Now we can use the trig identity $\sin^2x+\cos^2x=1$ but it doesn't seem very rational.

3999672,Why doesn't my derivation of the arcsec derivative formula not work?,"We would like to find the derivative of $\operatorname{arcsec}(x) = y$ . Rearranging this, we get $x = \sec(y)$ . Taking the derivative of both sides, we get $1 = \sec(y)\tan(y)y^\prime$ . Thus, $$y^\prime = \frac{1}{\sec(y)\tan(y)}.$$ Now, draw a right triangle with an acute angle $y$ , hypotenuse $x$ , and a side adjacent to angle $y$ with length $1$ . By the Pythagorean theorem, the side opposite angle $y$ is equal to $\sqrt{x^2-1}$ . Thus, we have $x = \sec(y)$ , which we already knew and got from the triangle, and $$\tan(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}$$ from the triangle we drew. We substitute these values in to our derivative expression to get $$y' = \frac{1}{x\sqrt{x^2-1}}.$$ However, $y^\prime$ should equal $$\frac1{|x|\sqrt{x^2-1}}$$ (note the absolute value). Since the difference occurred in the $|x|$ part, that means I must've done something wrong when I said $\sec(y) = x$ , but I do not know why this assumption is wrong.
