748325,Mysterious Proof about Induced Norms (was: Uniqueness of SVD),"In order to prove non-uniqueness of singular vectors when a repeated singular value is present, the book (Trefethen), argues as follows: Let $\sigma$ be the first singular value of A, and $v_{1}$ the corresponding singular vector. Let $w$ be another linearly independent vector such that $||Aw||=\sigma$, and construct a third vector $v_{2}$ belonging to span of $v_{1}$ and $w$, and orthogonal to $v_{1}$. All three vectors are unitary, so $w=av_{1}+bv_{2}$ with $|a|^2+|b|^2=1$, and $v_{2}$ is constructed (Gram-Schmidt style) as follows: $$ {v}_{2}= \dfrac{{w}-({v}_{1}^{T} w ){v}_{1}}{|| {w}_{1}-({v}_{1}^{T} {w} ){v}_{1} ||_{2}}$$ Now, Trefethen says, $||A||=\sigma$, so $||Av_{2}||\le \sigma$ but this must be an equality (and so $v_{2}$ is another singular vector relative to $\sigma$), since otherwise we would have $||Aw||<\sigma$, in contrast with the hypothesis. How that? I cannot see any elementary application of triangle inequality or Schwarz inequality  to prove this claim. I am pretty well convinced of partial non-uniqueness of SVD in certain situations. Other proofs are feasible, but I wish to undestand this specific algebraic step of this specific proof. Thanks.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'svd']"
748355,"Modular Form, but Cusp Form in Disguise","Suppose I have a holomorphic modular form $f \in M_k(\Gamma_0(N), \chi)$ with $k \in \mathbb Z^+$ and $f = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a(n)q^n$. Considering the $q$-expansion, one may suspicious that $f$ is actually a cusp form. Then, it remains to check that $f$ vanishes at the cusps of $\Gamma_0(N)$ (say $\Gamma_0(p)$, so we only have the two cusps). It is clear from the $q$-expansion of $f$ that it vanishes at the cusp at $\infty$, but how exactly do you show that it vanishes at the cusp at $0$? I have heard that it has something to do with finding $\gamma = \left( \begin{array}{c c} a & b \\ c & d \end{array} \right) \in GL_2(\mathbb Z)^+$ that takes $\infty$ to $0$ under the transformation $\gamma z = \frac{az+b}{cz+d}$. Then, somehow wrangle $f |_k \gamma = (cz+d)^{-k} f(\gamma z)$ back into a $q$-expansion at $\infty$. If this has no constant term, then $f$ vanishes at the cusp at $0$. If this is indeed the procedure for verifying vanishing at the cusps, then it is unclear to me what sort of ""wrangling"" needs to occur. I think the Fricke involution $W_N = \left( \begin{array}{c c} 0 & -1 \\ N & 0 \end{array} \right)$ would work for $\gamma$, but the $q$-expansion of $f$ is an unintelligible mess after hitting it with the $|_k$ operator.","['modular-forms', 'number-theory']"

748368,Odd and even functions.,"I have a book which says: If a function $f$ satisfies $f(-x)=f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain, then $f$ is called an even function. However, if $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for every $x$ in the domain of $f$, then $f$ is called an odd function. But this is not clear. Because it does not mention what happens when, for a particular function, $a$ is in its domain but $-a$ isn't. The ambiguity arises in a function like $f:\{-5,-1,0,1,6\} \to \{-6,0,1,5\}$ given by $f(-5)=5, f(-1)=f(1)=1, f(0)=0$ and $f(6)=-6.$ We cannot decide in which one of the following categories the function $f$ falls: 1. Both odd and even, 2. Odd, 3. Even, and 4. Neither odd nor even. [This is because I assumed that no one  wants a fifth category like ""can't decide"".] For that, can anybody please state the formal non-ambiguous definitions of odd and even fuctions? And also, regarding a problem such as this, can anybody tell me if there is any international body of Mathematics (like IUPAC is there for Chemistry), which decides which definitions and conventions to adopt and if it exists, how can I find those rules? I know such a question might sound silly, but I have a set of questions for interviews which has the following question: ""Give an example of a function which is both odd and even. Is your choice unique?"" - The answer to the second part of the question depends on the precise definition of odd and even functions.","['reference-request', 'functions', 'definition']"

I want to find the equation of a torus (I mean the process, not just the final equation that I can find on Google). Knowing that a torus is the set of point on the circles having all their centers on another circle I came with something like: Let $C_c$ be the ""central"" circle with a radius $R$ and and center $P_c(a, b, c)$. Also, let $M_1(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ be all the points on $C_c$. Let $C_a$ be an ""auxiliary"" circle (one that has $M_1$ as a center), $r$ his radius and $M_2(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ a point on that circle.

748576,What exactly is a dimension?,"Maybe this is too broad a question, maybe I need to be more specific. I am just clearing my head here, feel free to ignore at your pleasure. In Linear Algebra, we learned that the dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in its basis. This to me makes sense, since according to my understanding, the dimension of some space or some set with some 'structure' on it (Sorry, don't know how to put this) is the number of independent 'parameters' needed to specify each 'point' in it. Does this same understanding of dimension carry over to say a topological space or some other type of space? I read the following paragraph in Basic Topology by M.A. Armstrong Taking the dimension of $X$ to be the least number of continuous parameters needed to specify each point of $X$ is no good. Peano's example shows that the square has dimension 1 under this definition. This does my head in a little. What is the dimension of say a sphere or a torus? What does it mean to say that a surface is a two-dimensional, topological manifold? Or is it just the case that we have defined it to be that way, meaning that we say a set $A$ is said to have dimension $n$ if such and such is true? Is there some basic underlying principles guiding these definitons? The following definiton also confuses me if I think about it too much Let $V$ be a vector space over an arbitrary ﬁeld F. The projective space
  $P(V)$ is the set of 1-dimensional vector subspaces of $V$ . If $dim(V ) = n + 1$, then the

Can we find examples where this module induced by $\phi$ is not isomorphic to $M$? It seems that the two modules are at least in many ways similar, for example they have the same submodules. I can see that they must be isomorphic if $M$ is free, since then any basis of $M$ is also a basis for the induced module.

748872,Local Isometry of Sphere,"How does one show that there exists no neighborhood of a point on a sphere that may be isometrically mapped into a plane?  I understand that I can find the first fundamental form of the sphere $(u, v, \sqrt{r^2 - u^2 - v^2})$, for fixed $a>0$, which is given by: $E = 1 + \frac{u^{2}}{r^2 - u^2 - v^2}$, $F = \frac{u v}{r^2 - u^2 - v^2}$, and $G = 1 + \frac{v^2}{r^2 - u^2 - v^2}$.  Meanwhile, for the plane $(u,v,0)$, the first fundamental form is given by: $E = 1$, $F = 0$, $G = 1$.  Since these first fundamental forms are not equal, the isometry is impossible. But is this enough?  How do I account for the ""neighborhood"" condition? In some sense, this is a follow up question to ones like that which is given here: There is no isometry between a sphere and a plane. , but it is not truly derived therefrom.

748890,A gap in Halmos' definition of dimension? And how to repair?,"In Halmos' Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces , section I.8 has a proof of the Steinitz exchange lemma , which says that if $V$ is a vector space, $S$ is a finite independent subset of $V$, and $T$ is a finite generating subset of $V$, then the cardinality of $T$ is not less than the cardinality of $S$. Having proved this, Halmos goes on to assert that ""The number of elements in any basis of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ is the same as in any other basis."" But this is not quite right, because the lemma only proves that any two finite bases have the same number of elements. I don't see where it has been ruled out that there might still somehow be infinite bases lurking in a vector space with a finite basis. There is a theorem in section I.7 which says that any independent set can be extended to a basis. Halmos assumes that the independent set is finite, but I think the proof still goes through if we assume it possibly infinite, so that if there are any infinite independent subsets, we can extend it to an infinite basis. So it seems we need to rule out the possibility that a vector space with a finite basis might have an infinite independent set. Have I made a mistake anywhere in the above? And if not, can we repair the gap in this theorem easily? I took a quick look at Roman's Advanced Linear Algebra and it seems to have the same defect of assuming that in a vector space with a finite spanning set, all bases must be finite. I'm not able to find where this is proved. Roman has a proof that works for arbitrary vector spaces, but it uses cardinal arithmetic, which I am not familiar with.

748933,"Looking for a a measure-theoretic treatment of ""differential entropy""","If $X$ is a discrete random variable, its entropy $H(X)$ is usually defined as something along the lines of $-\sum \def\P{\mathbb{P}}\P(x) \log_2( \P(x))$, where the sum ranges over all the possible values $x$ of $X$. I have seen a few expositions of the problem of extending this definition to continuous random variables.  I take it that the standard counterpart to $H$ in the continuous case is the so-called differential entropy , denoted by $h(X)$, and defined as $$
\int f(x)\log_2(f(x)) dx\,,
$$ where $f$ is the probability density of $X$, and the integral runs over the (continuous) set of values of $X$. This definition is always contingent on the existence of the integral, but even putting aside this existence question, I'm a bit confused about the proper way to interpret this integral. None of the derivations (of the passage to the continuous case) has been terribly concerned over mathematical subtleties, such as well-definedness, convergence, etc.  A possible clue to this attitude is that all these derivations are based on the Riemann integral formalism, which strikes me as particularly ill-suited for thinking about this particular integral's convergence. I'm looking for a (hopefully mathematically rigorous) measure-theoretic approach to this generalization of the entropy to the continuous case.

R is reflexive if $( \forall x\in S)((x,x) \in R)$ R is symmetric if $(\forall x,y \in S)[(x,y) \in R \rightarrow (y,x) \in R]$ R is transitive if $(\forall x, y, z \in S)[((x,y) \in R \land (y,z) \in R) \rightarrow (x,z) \in R]$ For reflexivity, we have, $( \forall x \in S)((a,b),(a,b) \in R)$ and $a+b=b+a$ For symmetry, we have $(\forall x, y, \in S)[(a,b),(c,d) \in R \rightarrow (c,d),(a,b) \in R]$ and $a+d=b+c$ and $c+b=d+a$ For transitivity, we have $(\forall x,y,z \in S)[(a,b),(c,d) \in R \land (c,d),(e,f) \in R \rightarrow (a,b),(e,f) \in R]$ and $a+d=b+c$ and $c+f=d+e$ $a+d+c+f = b+c+d+e$ Subtracting c and d from both sides, we have $a+f =b+e$ which is $(a,b),(e,f) \in R$. We have proven that $R$ is an equivalence relation. My question is that how do I put more words into this proof or does this proof look fine? I have arrows drawn (on scratch paper) on the pairs which made it a bit easier to see how the proof process for reflexivity and symmetry is done. Another question I have is on this part for transitivity . Why  does $a+d=b+c$ and $c+f=d+e$ result in 
$a+d+c+f = b+c+d+e$? I don't see anything to substitute unless I just focus on gathering the left side of the equations which is $a+d+c+f$ and gather the right hand side of the equations together like  $b+c+d+e$ and that becomes $a+d+c+f = b+c+d+e$.

749528,"Isoperimetric inequality, isodiametric inequality, hyperplane conjecture... what are the inequalities of this kind known or conjectured?","Question: Which inequalities similar to the famous isoperimetric inequality is known?
  conjectured? I recently learned about some inequalities which are all similar to the famous isoperimetric inequality. Each time we consider two size functionals $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$ and along all the convex bodies (convex and compact) $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying $\Sigma'(K)=1$, we give a bound for $\Sigma(K)$.
For example in $\mathbb{R}^2$, with $\Sigma=\mathrm{Area}$ and  $\Sigma'=\mathrm{Perimeter}$ we have an upper-bound given by the famous isoperimetric inequality . If $\Sigma$ (resp. $\Sigma'$) is homogeneous of degree $k$ (resp. $k'$). The problem is equivalent to giving a bound to 
$$\frac{\Sigma(K)^{1/k}}{\Sigma'(K)^{1/k'}}$$
for all $K$ with $\Sigma'(K)\neq 0$.
Below I list the inequalities I encountered and give a quite general definition of what I consider size functionals. The classical isoperimetric inequality in higher dimensions states that for any convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with positive $(d-1)$- intrinsic volume we have $$0<\frac{V_d(K)^{1/d}}{V_{d-1}(K)^{1/(d-1)}}\leq \frac{V_d(\mathrm{Ball})^{1/d}}{V_{d-1}(\mathrm{Ball})^{1/(d-1)}}$$ where $V_d$ is the $d$-dimensional volume, $V_{d-1}$ the $(d-1)$-intrisic volume (twice the perimeter if $d=2$ and twice the surface area if $d=3$), and $\mathrm{Ball}$ is any $d$-dimensional ball. The isodiametric inequality state that for any convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with positive perimeter we have $$\frac{\mathrm{Diameter}(\mathrm{Disk})}{\mathrm{Perimeter}(\mathrm{Disk})} \leq\frac{\mathrm{Diameter}(K)}{\mathrm{Perimeter}(K)} \leq\frac12$$ where $\mathrm{Diameter}(K)$ is the maximum distance between two points of $K$.
 It has been proved by Bieberbach in 1915 (in german), I found this reference in the introduction of the article Isodiametric Problems for Polygons by by Michael J. Mossinghoff.
I guess this inequality is true in higher dimensions but I have no reference. Jung's theorem states that for any convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with positive diameter we have the second of the following inequalities (the first is obvious) $$\frac{\mathrm{Outradius}(\mathrm{Disk})}{\mathrm{Diameter(\mathrm{Disk})}}\leq \frac{\mathrm{Outradius}(K)}{\mathrm{Diameter(K)}}\leq \frac{\mathrm{Outradius}(\Delta_d)}{\mathrm{Diameter(\Delta_d)}}$$ where $\Delta_d$ is the $d$-dimensional regular simplex. The hyperplane conjecture states there exists a universal constant $C$ such that in any dimension, for any convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with positive volume, we have $$C\leq\frac{\mathrm{MaxSection}(K)^{1/(d-1)}}{\mathrm{Volume(K)}^{1/d}}<\infty$$ where $\mathrm{MaxSection}(K)=\max\left(V_{d-1}(K\cap H) : H \text{ any hyperplane of }\mathbb{R}^d\right)$ is the maximal hyperplane section of $K$. More generally if we note $\mathcal{K}=\mathcal{K}_d$ the set of convex body of $\mathbb{R}^d$ we can consider any size functional $\Sigma:\mathcal{K}\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ satisfying the following natural axioms: $\Sigma$ is continuous, not identically zero, homogeneous of some degree $k$, that is: $\Sigma(\lambda K)=\lambda^k \Sigma(K)$. increasing under set inclusion, that is: $K\subset M \Rightarrow \Sigma(K)\leq\Sigma(M)$ invariant under translation, that is: $\Sigma(K+x)=\Sigma(K)$. This covers most of the size functionals we usually consider: volume = area in dimension 2, surface area =perimeter in dimension 2, mean-width, min-width, max-width (=diameter) , width with a given direction in-radius : the radius of the biggest ball include in $K$, out-radius : the radius of the smalles ball include in $K$, intrinsic volumes the maximal hyperplane section: $\max\left(V_{d-1}(K\cap H) : H \text{ any hyperplane of }\mathbb{R}^d\right)$ ... Now for any choice of couple of size functionals $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$ of degree $k$ and $k'$, if $K$ is a convex body with $\Sigma'(K)\neq0$ the fraction
$$\frac{\Sigma(K)^{1/k}}{\Sigma'(K)^{1/k'}}\in[0,\infty[$$
is invariant under translation or rescaling of $K$. I am interested by lower or upper bound for such fraction once we have fixed the dimension $d$ and $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$.","['convex-analysis', 'inequality', 'differential-geometry', 'conjectures', 'big-list']"

750095,Some problems with evaluating $\int_0^{\pi}\ln(\sin x+\sqrt{1+\sin^2x})dx$,"I'm trying to evaluate
$$\int_{0}^{\pi}\ln\left(\sin\left(x\right) + \sqrt{\,1 + \sin^{2}\left(x\right)\,}\,\right)\,{\rm d}x .
$$ I tried to evaluate it by making the substitution $u =\sin x$, but I faced a problem. Since $\sin\left(\pi\right) = \sin\left(0\right) = 0$, the integral is equal to $0$. But by plotting the integrand, the integral seems to have a real non-zero value. To avoid this problem I expressed the integral as  $ \displaystyle 2\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \ln\left(\sin\left(x\right) + \sqrt{\,1 + \sin^{2}\left(x\right)\,}\,\right)\,{\rm d}x $. Then I tried letting  $u = \sin x$. How do you explain that the integral has a real non-zero value but by some substitution it's equal to zero? And how does one evaluate the integral?","['definite-integrals', 'integration']"
750118,Elementary proof that there is no paradoxical decomposition using triangular pieces,"I am teaching a geometry course and I am trying to understand two definitions in the textbook (""Geometry with Geometry Explorer"" by Michael Hvidsten.) Definition: The area of a rectangle is its base times its height. Definition:  If two figures can be made equivalent, we will say that they have the same area. Here we say that two figures can be made equivalent if each can be split into the same finite number of polygons (without loss of generality, triangles) such that corresponding pairs are congruent.  Note that ""split"" does not exactly mean ""partitioned"" here, because we allow the edges of the triangles to overlap. To me it seems that the first definition is defining ""area"" in a special case, and the second definition is defining ""has the same area.""  However, we are clearly meant to infer that if two rectangles ""have the same area"" in the second sense then they have the same ""area"" in the first sense.  Is this obvious? Of course one can prove it using analytic methods because triangles are Lebesgue measurable.  However, the course takes a synthetic approach to geometry, so it would be better to avoid this.  So my question is the following: Is there a proof in elementary synthetic geometry that two rectangles $R$ and $R'$ with different values for ""base times height"" ( e.g. $1 \times 1$ and $2 \times 1$) cannot be split into finitely many triangles $T_i,\ldots,T_n$ and $T'_1,\ldots,T'_n$ respectively, with $T_i \cong T'_i$ for all $i \le n$?","['geometry', 'area', 'paradoxes']"
750131,Degree of closure of $\mathbb{Q}_p$,"In order to prove that algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is infinite, I took the polynomial $x^n-p$ with $n>1$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ to show that this eqaution has no solution for infinite cases to get the result but I want to make one part of the proof precise. It's clear that $x^2-p$ has no solution in the field so we adjoin $\sqrt{p}$ to get $\mathbb{Q}_p(\sqrt{p})$. For higher powers of $n$, clearly $p^{1/n}$ is not contained in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ but how do we show that $p^{1/n}$ is not contained in the extensions with smaller $n$? For instance how do we show that $\sqrt[3]{p}\notin \mathbb{Q}_p(\sqrt{p})$?

750166,"Is there any general function $x(t)$ that gives the solution to $x''(t) = k/x(t)^2$, where k is a constant?","In physics class, I  often come across various inverse square law equations like the following: $F_G= G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$ $F_E = k_e\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$ Specifically, we are typically given problems involving one fixed body and one body that interacts with that body over a one-dimensional axis (in a manner given by one of the above laws). Thus, the acceleration at any given time of the free body can be modeled by the following differential equation, where the masses/charges/physical constants involved collapse into a single value, k. (This physics stuff is just included for some context.) $x''(t)=\frac{k}{x(t)^2}$ However, my exact mathematical question is, given any initial conditions for x(0) and x'(0), is there a general solution to the above equation? In short, tell me about solving the subsequent equations for x(t) please. $x(0) = \mathrm{some\, initial\, value} $ $x'(0) = \mathrm{some\, initial\, value} $ $x''(t) = \frac{k}{x(t)^2} $, where k is a constant Again -- please help, A Curious Calculus Student Who Doesn't Know Much P.S.

750207,What is the kernel of a Maurer-Cartan form?,"The Maurer-Cartan form on the Lie group $Gl(n,\mathbb{R})$ is a one-form taking values in $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R})$ as defined in the link. It has a rather concrete ""extrinsic definition"" as $\omega_{A}=A^{-1}dA$, which is apparently a slight abuse of notation. Question: What precisely is the kernel of $\omega_{A}$, as referred to in the foliation literature? Is there a concrete way to
  see the kernel of $\omega_{A}$ using the above ""extrinsic definition""? I think the kernel of the lie-algebra-valued one form is locally the space of horizontal vectors as described on page 94 of this reference . The present question should be interpreted as asking how to most easily interpret this from the point of view of the above ""extrinsic definition"". For example, can we calculate this kernel by multiplying matrix of $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R})$ (perhaps by the natural identification with the tangent space) by the matrix of one-forms $\omega_{A}=A^{-1}dA$? (I don't think this is right.) How concrete can this calculation be made in the matrix case?","['manifolds', 'lie-algebras', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"
