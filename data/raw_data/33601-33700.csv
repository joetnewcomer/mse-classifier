319979,How to write permutations as product of disjoint cycles and transpositions,"$$\sigma=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 &3 & 4& 5& 6&7 &8 &9 &10 & 11 \\ 4&2&9&10&6&5&11&7&8&1&3    \end{pmatrix}$$ (1) I am asked to write this permutation in $S_{11}$ as a product of disjoint cycles and also as a product of transpositions. (2) Also find the order of the element. Is this permutation even or odd? I think these are the disjoint cycles $E_{1}=(1,4,10)$ , $\;\operatorname{order}E_1 =3$ $E_{2}= (3,9,8,7,11),\;$ $\operatorname{order}E_{2} =5$ $E_{3}=(5,6),\;$ $\operatorname{order}E_{3} =2$ $S_{11}$ = $E_{1} \cdot E_{2}\cdot  E_{3}$ The order of $\operatorname{order}E_{3}$ is even so the order of the permutation is even. Why are they asking this? And what is the significance of it being even or odd? Transpositions – I have read this a couple times but the one example in my textbook is rather unclear, I am not sure what this means? I think the transposition for $E_{1}$ is $(1,4)(1,10)$ but I'm not sure what this means.","['permutations', 'abstract-algebra']"

B_{x}:=\cap_{x\in A_{i}}A_{i}$ . [Note: $B_{x}\in S$ $\impliedby$ ( $B_{x}$ - countable intersection]. Lemma : $B_{x}\cap B_{y}\neq\emptyset \implies B_{x}=B_{y}$ .

If: there are finite sets of the
form $B_{x}$ then: $S$ is a union of a finite number of disjoint sets $\implies$ $S$ is finite $\implies$ there is an infinite number of sets of
the form $B_{x}$ . $\implies$ $|\bigcup\limits_{i\in A \subseteq\mathbb{N}}B_{x_{i}}| \geq \aleph_{0}$ .(contradiction) $\square$ There are couple of things I don't understand in this proof: Why the fact that we found a set ( $B_{x}\setminus B_{z}$ ) in $S$ containing $x$ and is strictly contained in $B_{x}$ a contradiction

320078,Bezier Curves and Acceleration,"So I'm working on a program that graphs a bezier curve by manipulating the control points.  This curve represents the velocity of something over time; I also want the option manipulate it all in terms of acceleration in respect to that velocity.  My initial thought was to take the derivative of the bezier curve function and plot that with the same control points. In my program it works, however I think the math doesn't really do what I want. This nice article has helped me on the math so far, but the problem I'm facing is that the derivative curve is simply ""off."" The graphs below are velocity on the Y axis and time on the X axis. Here's what the graph looks like with my bezier function: Now, the derivative of that looks like this... I'm not sure if my math is off, or if that's simply what the derivative of the bezier function actually does.  But, what I really want to do is take my bezier curve and draw the rate of change over the same domain.  However, the derivative seems to take it out of the domain (when you see my graphs below you'll see how the derivative changes the scope). What can I do to extrapolate the data I'm looking for from this curve (turning velocity over time with a bezier function into acceleration over time)? Here's the code where I'm drawing the point of the graph (it is calculating the curve from 0 to 1 and drawing a point there).  I subract an extra 1 with n (the number of control points) as I calculate in an extra 1 at some point in the code above to be more efficient elsewhere: Bezier function: position $+=$ linearCombination$(n - 1, z) \cdot$ Mathf.Pow$((1.0f - t), n - 1 - z) \cdot$ Mathf.Pow$(t, z) \cdot$ controls[$z$].position; Derivative: position $+=$ linearCombination$( n - 2, z ) \cdot$ Mathf.Pow$(1.0f - t, n - 2 - z) \cdot$ Mathf.Pow $(t, z) \cdot (n - 1) \cdot$ (controls[$z + 1$].position - controls[$z$].position );","['graphing-functions', 'bezier-curve', 'derivatives']"

320137,Signed Multinomial Expansion Coefficients?,"I've been spending probably an undue amount of time trying to compute the coefficients of polynomials of the form $p_n(x_1, ..., x_n) = \displaystyle\prod_{\sigma \in \{ -1 , 1 \}^{n-1} } (x_1 + \displaystyle\sum_{i=2}^n \sigma_{i-1} \cdot x_i ) ,$ for $n\ge 3.$ $\sigma_i$ is simply the $i$th component of $\sigma .$ These polynomials arise naturally as the templates for minimial polynomials defining the critical point loci in the Fermat Weber problem. Clearly the resulting polynomial will be homogeneous of degree $2^{n-1},$ and arguing by symmetry shows that the coefficients of a particular monomial are invariant under permutation of the indices. It's not too hard, for instance, to see that the coefficients for terms of the form $x_i^{2^{n-1}}$ and $x_i^2x_j^{2^{n-1}-2}$ are $1$ and $-2^{n-2},$ respectively.

Given a function $z = f(x,y)$, the first derivative with respected to $x$ is written as $$ \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} $$ So, for example $$
z = 5x+3y\\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 5

$$a_i^{N}+f^i_{N-1}(y_1,\ldots,y_m)a_i^{N-1}+\ldots+f^i_0(y_1,\ldots,y_m)=0$$
for every $i=1,\ldots,n$, or equivalently
$$X_i^{N}+f^i_{N-1}(\tilde{y_1},\ldots,\tilde{y_m})X_i^{N-1}+\ldots+f^i_0(\tilde{y_1},\ldots,\tilde{y_m})=g_i(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$$
for some $g_i\in I(X)$. If $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is a point of $X$, the $g_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0$ thus $x_i$ is a solution of $f^i(x)=0$, where
$$f^i(x)=x^{N}+f^i_{N-1}(y_1,\ldots,y_m)x^{N-1}+\ldots+f^i_0(y_1,\ldots,y_m)$$
Now, $X$ irreducible implies $I(X)$ prime and so $A$ is an integral domain. We can take field of fractions and consider $f^i(x)\in k(a_1,\ldots,a_n)[X]$. Now by fundamental theorem of algebra, we get that there are only finitely many solutions $x_i^0$ of $f^i(x)=0$
This is what i understood. Now what follows is obscure for me: for every point $y=(y_1,\ldots,y_m)\in\mathbb{A}^m$ we have only finitely many points $x=(x_1^0,\ldots,x_n^0)\in X$ such that $\Phi(x)=y$.

320579,Probability question involving sets of cards,"I have an infinite deck built out of sets of 10 cards (in other words 10*n cards). The sets are identical so one '2' is identical to another '2'. A player draws 6 cards. If he draws: any '1' AND a '2', or any '3' AND a '4', or any '5' AND a '6', or any '7' AND a '8', or any '9' AND a '10', he wins. In other words there are 5 pairs and if the player draws a complete pair he gets a point. What is the probability he won't win any points at all? To expand on the problem, if the player gets a point for every pair he completes in a hand, what is the probability he'll get 1, 2, or even 3 points? (3 points being 6 cards of 3 completed pairs) From what I know of Newton's Binomial, there are : $\binom{10}{6} = 210$ different hand combinations. To expand even further, how do the probabilities change if the source deck ceases to be infinite? From trial and error I can see that if the deck has only 10 cards then the player has to draw at least 1 complete pair. Example: For example, a hand of {1,1,3,5,5,9} will get no points. A hand of {1,1,2,3,4,5} will get 2. Script: I've made a simple js script to roughly calculate the probabilities of the infinite deck to verify if your mathematical answer is on track. I am yet to write a script which simulates a finite number of cards in a deck. http://jsfiddle.net/ch3shirecat/xZ8s5/ After azimut's answer: A slight explanation. If the deck has more than 10 cards (10*n with n>1) then any card can have more than 1 other card as a pair. For example, in a deck of 30 there'll be three '1' cards and three '2' cards with 9 possible pairings between them (with each giving a point). So the hand of {1,2,1,2,1,2} is possible and will give 3 pairings. Does it make sense? Thank you!","['card-games', 'inclusion-exclusion', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

320596,No well-ordered set is isomorphic to any of its initial segments,"I'm trying to solve a simple problem of set theory. I found it in Kuratowski's book (Corollary $8$,chapter $1$), but I'd like to solve it in an slightly different way. This is the statement and a first attempt, until the point where I got stuck. Let $(A,\trianglelefteq)$ be a well ordered set. Then there is no isomorphism between the set and any of its initial segments. Let us consider a well ordered set $(A,\trianglelefteq)$ and, by contradiction,  suppose that does exist an isomorphism $$f:(A,\trianglelefteq)\rightarrow (pred(A,a,\trianglelefteq )),$$ where $(pred(A,a,\trianglelefteq )$ is the initial segment generated by $a$.
Since the set is well ordered, each of its non-empty subset has a least element (w.r. to the ordering). Then consider $B=\{y\in A | f(y)\neq y\}$, that is non-empty (e.g. $f(a)\neq a$, because we are supposing that the isomorphism is not the identity). I wish to derive a contradiction working only on the least element of $B$, say $m=\min_{\trianglelefteq}B$, That is, the unique possibility is $m=f(m)$ (it is not possible that $m\trianglelefteq f(m)$ or $f(m)\trianglelefteq m$).
Now I have some idea but there's something wrong, and up to now I haven't gotten the exact and rigorous solution. 
I've found some other questions concerning this topic, but I would like to solve it just in this way, using the $m$ defined above.

I tried manipulating things, the only potentially useful expression I could come up with was: $$(n!-1)(m!-1)=1+k^2$$ I have tried modular arithmetic on both sides to get some additional conditions but nothing useful came up.

The cards as you see them on the screenshot above are placed from left to right using the index i (because they are sorted by color and rank already at the server) using this call: // 12 cards (1 full) should fit into table width,

320842,Metric Tensor and Curvature,"I have a doubt about the metric tensor and curvature. My point is: last year I was talking to a mathematician that I know and he said to me that the metric tensor is something that we define on a manifold like an inner product is defined on a vector space. What he said is: given a vector space $V$ we can define any inner product that we want, it just must comply with the axioms. The same happens with the metric tensor: given a manifold $M$ we can define any metric tensor, it just needs to assign to each point a valid inner product on the tangent space. But hat brought me some doubts: the $2$-sphere is a manifold $S^2$, and it has curvature. This is obvious geometrically: we can see that $S^2$ cannot be considered flat in any way. However, the curvature tensor which gives the curvature, is defined in terms of the metric. If we can define any metric that we want, then how we're going to recover the "" true "" curvature of the sphere ? In other words, I think that there wouldn't be a problem to assign to the $S^2$ as a metric tensor the tensor field that at each point assign just the euclidean inner product. I thought that the metric tensor was derived from the charts, but this mathematician said that it's not, it's just defined at our will, having to satisfy the inner product properties at any point. Can someone point out a good reference for me to read more about how to obtain the metric and so on ? Or even give some example ? Thanks in advance. And sorry if the question is silly.
