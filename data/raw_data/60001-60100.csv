667974,"Show that exists a function not increasing $f:(a,b)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous only over $(a,b)\setminus D$","Let $D$ a infinity countable subset of $(a,b)$. Show that exists a function not increasing $f:(a,b)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous only over $(a,b)\setminus D$ This is an exercise of my course of Measure and Integration. The next exercise is to show there is a function not increasing over $[0,1]$ that is continuous only over the $[0,1]\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ and I'm thinking that the first exercise is a more geral approach. I'm right or there is two versions of the same exercise? I know how to solve the second (the example to solve), but I'm not convinced that the first exercise is the same thing. If the first is a more geral approach, I need help how to solve this.","['lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"
668065,Adelic/Idelic method for number fields,"I'm searching for a place where is developed all the machinery of adeles and ideles of a number field; the functional equation for the zeta functions is gained by idelic integration, and it's seen the connection between the compactness(and the finitness of measure, that comes from the functional equation) of the quotient (ideles of absolute value 1)/(nonzero rationals) and the two finitness theorem of class group and Dirichlet unit theorem. I would like somewhere, where is proved that: 1)The only valutations for number field archimedean are the $[K:\mathbb{Q}]$ given by the immersion composed with standard absolute value(the non archimedean are easy to work out as the usual p-adic relatevily to the primes of the ring of integers). 2)The standard fourier analysis is developed for adeles of number field(at least i've seen in the rational case,the deduction of the functional equation for the zeta, using self duality of this group, discrete immersion of Q, and fourier expansion by characters e(ax) for Q periodic function, a in Q, and so Poisson summation formula, that is(as it seems to me)the major tool that pushes the computation to the functional equation). 3)The basic theorems of algebraic number theory are proved by the finitness of (ideles of absolute value 1)/(non zero rational) I think i've worked the second thing by analogy with the rational case that i've already seen, and 3) just by inspection because once someone told you that these things are related is just clear to see how. But i would really like a reference for all this stuff: also more of them are welcome, since i'm curious to see people's intuition about this stuff, since i'm studying it on my own.

668068,"How would you prove that the graph of a linear equation is a straight line, and vice versa, at a ""high school"" level? [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Why do we believe the equation $ax+by+c=0$ represents a line? (7 answers) Closed 10 years ago . This is something I've been wondering about. Namely, I've always accepted ""on intuition"" that the equation $$ax + by = c$$ is, when graphed, a line. You can plot the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation and see that yeah, they do indeed form a line. But when I came across this, I realized was that I had accepted this idea without proof : http://www.math.jhu.edu/~wsw/ED/harelfinal.pdf There is enough material in the text to convince the students empirically that a line in the
  plane is represented by a linear equation, and that the graph of a linear equation is a line.
  However, these two fundamental theorems on linear functions are not justified mathematically.
  (pg. 5) and Important theorems on linear functions are not proved. Relevant to the above two
  standards are two fundamental theorems: A line in the plane is represented by a linear equation
  and the graph of a linear equation is a line. Neither of these theorems is proved.
  (pg. 16) Which made me wonder (I haven't seen the texts) -- just how would you not only ""justify"" this mathematically, but in a way a high-schooler would understand? And not only that, but in a manner which is actually enlightening? In addition, this criticism is leveled against all four high school geometry/algebra books. For example, consider if we were using, say, Hilbert's axioms as our axiom set for Euclidean geometry. Then we could show that the equation is a line by something like this: find three points A, B, and C satisfying it so that $A * B * C$ (the ""betweenness"" relation), then show that for any point $D$ which is not $A$ or $B$, then one of $D * A * B$, $A * D * B$, or $A * B * D$ must hold. Going the other way (the converse), to show the line is given by the equation, you'd show that for any points A, B, C with $A * B * C$, then every point $D$ with $D * A * B$, $A * D * B$, or $A * B * D$ satisfies some equation of the form $ax + by = c$. However, it seems this kind of proof is fairly tedious (you have to check three cases in both implications), and relies on quadratic functions and radicals since you have to use the distance formula as that's how you'd define the ""betweenness"" relation for three points. I suppose the details would vary with regard to the axiom set we use (I don't know if Hilbert's would necessarily be the best for ""high school geometry"") -- but it seems no matter which one we use, we need some way to determine that three points A, B, and C ""lie on the same line"" (which is what the ""betweenness"" relation does, although it does more, since it also orders the points), and a way to express this with regards to coordinatized points as well as points in the axiomatic geometry which the coordinate plane models. It seems that any formula I've seen for that fact using Cartesian coordinates requires a quadratic polynomial expression, for one. Any proof along these lines seems like it would be tedious, or require additional motivation, and so might not be enlightening at this lower level of the person's mathematical development. The ""message"" seems to easily get lost as one gets bogged down in mechanics. How would you solve this problem? What's a good way to justify this at such a level?","['geometry', 'education', 'algebra-precalculus', 'euclidean-geometry']"

668172,Number of sylow subgroups of $A_5$ and $S_5$ - Dummit foote $4.5.31$,"Question is : For $p=2,3$ and $5$ find $n_p(A_5)$ and $n_p(S_5)$. [Note that $A_4\leq A_5$] What i have done so far is : for $A_5$ we have $|A_5|=5.4.3$ possible number of sylow subgroups are $n_2(A_5)=(1+2k)\mid 15\Rightarrow n_2(A_5)=1\text { or }3\text { or }5\text { or }15$ $n_3(A_5)=(1+3k)\mid 20\Rightarrow n_3(A_5)=1\text { or }4\text { or }10$ $n_5(A_5)=(1+5k)\mid 12\Rightarrow n_5(A_5)=1\text { or }6$ Now, by thanking the result $A_5$ is simple I would conclude that possibilities are : $n_2(A_5)=(1+2k)\mid 15\Rightarrow n_2(A_5)=3\text { or }5\text { or }15$ $n_3(A_5)=(1+3k)\mid 20\Rightarrow n_3(A_5)=4\text { or }10$ $n_5(A_5)=(1+5k)\mid 12\Rightarrow n_5(A_5)=6$ With this it is concluded that there are exactly $6$ sylow $5$ subgroups. Number of elements of  order $3$ in $S_5$ (they are actually in $A_5$) are $\frac{5.4.3}{3}=20$ Now, each element of order $3$ has to be in some sylow $3$ subgroup.As there are $20$ non identity elements of order $3$ and each sylow subgroup affords only $2$ non identity elements there should be $10$ sylow $3$ subgroups ($10\times 2=20$) So, now we have $n_5(A_5)=6,n_3(A_5)=10$ Suppose $n_2(A_5)=3$ we would have (assuming no two sylow subgroups intersect non trivially) $3\times 3=9$ non identity elements and adding up with above collection of non identity elements we would get $(3\times 3=9)+(10\times 2=20)+(6\times 4=24)=53$ which is a contradiction as there are $59$ non identity elements in $A_5$ So, Possibilities are  $n_2(A_5)=5\text { or }15$ and there are two chances : there are $5$ sylow $2$ subgroups with no two sylow subgroup intersecting non trivially adds upto $5\times 3=15$ non identity elements and with above calculation we have $(5\times 3=15)+(10\times 2=20)+(6\times 4=24)=59$ so we do not have any problem with this. there are $15$ sylow $2$ subgroups  such that for any two  distinct sylow $2$ subgroups we have $|P_2\cap P_2'|=2$ then each sylow $2$ subgroup contribute only one non identity element which is not there in any other sylow $2$ subgroup adding upto $15\times 1=15$ non identity elements. In this case also we are not getting any problem as all non identity elements adds up to $59$ with $(15\times 1=15)+(10\times 2=20)+(6\times 4=24)=59$ But then I have seen that all sylow $2$ subgroups are of order $4$ and are of the form $\mathbb{Z_2}\times \mathbb{Z_2}$ and then $$\{e,(1 ~2)(3~ 4),(1~ 3)(2~ 4),(1~4)(2~3)\}\cap\{e,(1~2)(3~5),(1~5)(2~3),(1~3)(2~5)\}=\{e\}$$ So, I have two sylow $2$ subgroups that intersect trivially (I have actually listed out the other sylow subgroups and they also intersect trivially) which contradicts above possibility of $|P_2\cap P_2'|=2$ (I have also checked it and $2,2$ cycles got exhausted after writing $5$ sylow $2$ subgroups) Thus i strongly believe there are $5$ sylow $2$ subgroups which are intersecting trivially... But then how do i write this with less labour work i mean I do not like the idea of writing down all sylow $2$ subgroups until the elements got exhausted so i would like to know if there is any better idea to say that $n_2(A_5)=5$. Thus, we have : $n_2(A_5)=5$ $n_3(A_5)=10$ $n_5(A_5)=6$ For $S_5$ we have $|S_5|=120=5.4.3.2=5.3.2^3$. Possible no.of sylow subgroups are $n_2(S_5)=(1+2k)\mid 30 \Rightarrow n_2(A_5)=1\text { or }3\text { or }5\text { or }15$ $n_3(S_5)=(1+3k)\mid 40\Rightarrow n_3(A_5)=1\text { or }4\text { or }10\text { or }40$ $n_5(S_5)=(1+5k)\mid 24\Rightarrow n_5(A_5)=1\text { or }6$ As $S_5$ is not simple, I can not say for the same reason as above i would exclude the possibility of $n_p=1$ but then, I know that $H\leq G\Rightarrow n_p(H)\leq n_p(G)$. for this reason we have : $n_2(S_5)=5\text { or }15$ $n_3(S_5)=10\text { or }40$ $n_5(S_5)=6$ So, It is confirmed thar number of sylow $5$ subgroups in $S_5$ are $6$. any element in  $3$ sylow subgroup is a $3$ cycle so it has to be in $A_5$ so there is no possibility of having another sylow $3$ subgroup outside $A_5$ thus $n_3(S_5)=10$ for this reason we have : $n_2(S_5)=5\text { or }15$ $n_3(S_5)=10$ $n_5(S_5)=6$ We would count the number of non identity elements in more worst cases : Suppose $n_2(S_5)=5$ with trivial intersection between any two sylow $2$ subgroups gives $5\times 7=35$ non identity elements adding up non identity elements of sylow $3$ subgroups and sylow $5$ subgroups adds upto $(5\times 7=35)+(10\times 2=20)+(6\times 4=24)=79$ but then there are $119$ non identity elements in $S_5$. So, I should get (for no good reason) that there are $15$ sylow $2$ subgroups of $S_5$. Conclusion is that : $n_2(A_5)=5;n_2(S_5)=15$ $n_3(A_5)=n_3(S_5)=10$ $n_5(A_5)=n_5(S_5)=6$ I would be thankful if some one verify this calculation and i would be much more thankful if someone suggest me a better/well written/less labored approach. Thank you :) P.S: I do not even understand the special mention he have in the question saying : $\textbf{[Note that $A_4\leq A_5$]}$. please help me to know if i am missing anything.","['sylow-theory', 'symmetric-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
668244,What is the right interpretation of the axiom of extensionality,"A set $a$ can be called extensional if it has the following propery:
$$\forall b\left[\forall x\left[x\in b\iff x\in a\right]\Rightarrow a=b\right]$$
Based on this the axiom of extensionality can be formulated as: $$\forall a\left[a\text{ is extensional}\right]$$ How exactly should  this axiom be interpreted? I see two options: 1) The statement that every set is extensional. 2) The statement that  sets that are not extensional are to be neglected. The first looks like a statement of a dictator. The second 
more like an admittance that there is more, but that we agree to keep that out of sight. If statement 2) could be practicized
then I would choose for it, but I have my doubts about that, which is the reason
for asking this. addendum Inspired by comments and answers (thank you very much!) I have decided
to share something about my motivation and also my doubts about option
2). A set $a$ is regular if it has the following property: $$\forall b\left[a\in b\Rightarrow\exists c\in b\; c\cap b=\emptyset\right]$$ Based on that the axiom of regularity can be formulated as: $$\forall b\left[b\text{ is regular}\right]$$
This axiom can be accepted in the awareness that you just restrict
your scope and focus on studying the regular ones. You could say that
option 2) 'works' here. If $\mathbf{V}$ denotes the class of all
extensional sets then there is a subclass $\mathbf{G}$ of regular
extensionals. Option 1) applied on regulars says: $\mathbf{V}=\mathbf{G}$
while option 2) says: focus on $\mathbf{G}$. Here I prefer the second
option. This is facilitated by the fact that the elements
of regular sets are regular, which means that by focusing on regulars
their elements do not get out of sight. It should be remarked here that you need the
axioms PAIR and SUM to prove this. This facilitation lacks (or seems to lack; uptil now I was looking for it in vain) when
it comes to extensionals, which was the reason for my doubt concerning
the second option applied on extensionals.","['axioms', 'philosophy', 'elementary-set-theory', 'soft-question']"

Put $$A_n=\sum_{k=0}^n a_k,\quad B_n=\sum_{k=0}^nb_k,\quad C_n=\sum_{k=0}^nc_k,\quad \beta_n=B_n-B.$$ Then after some manipulations we obtain $$C_n=A_nB+\underbrace {a_0\beta_n+a_1\beta_{n-1}+\dots+a_n\beta_0}_{\gamma_n}$$ We wish to show that $C_n\to AB$. Since $A_nB\to AB$, we only need to show that $\gamma_n\to0$ as $n\to \infty$. Then the proof proceeds as below. Put $$\alpha=\sum_{n=0}^\infty|a_n|.$$
Let $\epsilon>0$ be given. By (c), $\beta_n\to0$. Hence we can choose N such that $|\beta_n|\leq\epsilon$ for $n\ge N$, in which case $$\begin{align}|\gamma_n|&\leq|\beta_0a_n+\dots+\beta_Na_{n-N}|+|\beta_{N+1}a_{n-N-1}+\dots+\beta_na_0|

(3) Show the statement for measurable non-negative functions. (4) Show the statement for any measurable functions $f$. For (2) I can use the properties of the integral relating to measurable non-negative functions (such as monotony, linearity,...). For (32) I can use the approximation by elementar functions. And for (4) I can use the sepation $f=f^+-f^-$. (1) Let $A\in\mathcal{A}'$ arbitrary. Then by definition
$$
\int 1_A\circ T\, d\mu=\int_{T^{-1}A}\, d\mu=\mu(T^{-1}(A))=\int 1_A\, d(\mu\circ T^{-1}).

$$
\int f\circ T\, d\mu=\int\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\alpha_i 1_{A_i}\circ T)\, d\mu=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i\int 1_{A_i}\circ T\, d\mu=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i\int 1_{A_i}\, d(\mu\circ T^{-1})\\=\int\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i 1_{A_i}\, d(\mu\circ T^{-1}).
$$ (3) Let $f\geq 0$ measurable. Then there exists a sequence $(f_n)$ of elementar function with $f_n\nearrow f$. From this it follows that $0\leq f_n\circ T\nearrow f\circ T$. From this it follows (together with (2))
$$
\int f\circ T\, d\mu=\sup_n\int f_n\circ T\, d\mu=\sup_n\int f_n\, d(\mu\circ T^{-1})=\int f\, d(\mu\circ T^{-1}).
$$ (4) Let $f$ be any measurable function and $f\circ T\in\mathcal{L}_{\mu}^1$. Then it is $f=f^+-f^-$, whereat $f^+$ and $f^-$ are measurable, nonnegative functions. So one can apply (3), getting
with the linearity of the integral for measurable, non-negative functions

\int f\circ T\, d\mu=\int f^+\circ T\, d\mu - \int f^-\circ T\, d\mu=\int f^+\, d(\mu\circ T^{-1})-\int f^-\, d(\mu\circ T^{-1})\\=\int f\, d(\mu\circ T^{-1}).

Some snarky statement about using this to prove 1=0. Calm down, I know that the above is not a proof in $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual notion of convergence. And I am not claiming that it is. I know all about infinite series and partial sums and epsilons and deltas and all that great fantastic stuff. This is just a neat mathematical exploration and I'm hoping some of you come along with me on this. Motivation Now the above ""doubly infinite geometric series"" actually has some uses. One thing is that it provides and insight in how to determine the representation of $-1$ as a p-adic number. For instance in the context of so called $10-adic$ numbers we can easily see from the arithmetic that, $$ \dots \overline{999}. + 1 = 0 $$ Now in the reals, $$1 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{9}{10^k} $$ In the 10-adic numbers, $$ \dots \overline{999} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty 9 \cdot 10^k $$ Which means that we could write, $$ 0 = \dots \overline{999}. + 1 = \left(  \sum_{k=0}^\infty 9 \cdot 10^k 
\right)_{\mathbb{Q}_{10}} + \left(\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{9}{10^k} \right)_{\mathbb{R}}$$ So it seems as if somehow this identity allows us to to relate the expressions for rationals in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ to the expressions for rationals in $\mathbb{R}$. Observation Something which has always struck me about the usual proof of the finite/infinite geometric series is that the formula depends only on the algebraic properties of the number system. In that sense perhaps we can think of this identity not as a statement about the real numbers (for which it is obviously not true) but somehow a statement about the properties of fields. The Question I want to know other contexts in which this ""identity"" has proven useful. Possible answers include but are not limited to, Any useful application of the identity distinct from the one above. Rigorous notions of convergence for which the identity makes sense.

Then, show that the volume $V(r)=\int_{0<\left|z\right|<r}\rho(z)^{2}\left|dz\right|^{2}$ is finite for each $0<r<1$ and compute its value. Finally, verify that $V(r)=2V(r^{2})$ and give the intuition here. Here is what I have done thus far: I used the universal covering map $\pi(z)=e^{iz}$ which then induces a metric $\rho(z)=\frac{1}{z\log(z)}dz$. We get this because $\frac{(dx)+(dy)}{y}$ is the metric on the upper half plane that clearly corresponds to $\left|dz\right|/(r\log(r))$ where $\left|z\right|=r$ and $y=\log(r)$. This tells us that the circle has a length of $\frac{2{\pi}}{\log(r)}$, which tends to zero as $r$ goes to zero. I think this is all pretty reasonable so far.

That is ${\pi}^{*}(\rho(z))=\rho(\pi(z))\left|dz\right|$, which is clearly equivalent to $\left|dz\right|/(\mathrm{Im}(z))$ given how we have defined the universal covering map and the induced metric on the punctured unit disk.

$(\frac{3}{7},\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5},\frac{3}{7}, \frac{1}{3})\notin A_1$.
Thus, we can not conclude that $A_1\subset A_2$ or $A_2 \subset A_1$. Since $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the subsets of unit cube in $\mathbb{R}^6$, the volume of $A_1$ and $A_2$ are finite. My question is that could one compare the volume of $A_1$ and $A_2$? Thank you for your kindness.","['geometry', 'inequality']"
669233,Inverse Functions and $u$-Substitution,"Back in my undergrad days I wrote a false proof of the following. Problem. Prove that $\displaystyle\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{dx}{1+e^{\sin{x}}}=\pi$ Proof. Integrating by parts gives
$$
\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{dx}{1+e^{\sin{x}}}
= \left.\frac{x}{1+e^{\sin{x}}}\right\vert_0^{2\pi}+\int_0^{2\pi}
x\cdot\frac{e^{\sin x}\cos{x}}{(e^{\sin{x}}+1)^2}dx 
=\pi+\int_0^{2\pi}
x\cdot\frac{e^{\sin x}\cos{x}}{(e^{\sin{x}}+1)^2}dx 
$$
Taking $u=\sin x$ in the last integral gives
$$
\int_0^{2\pi}
x\cdot\frac{e^{\sin x}\cos{x}}{(e^{\sin{x}}+1)^2}dx 
=\int_0^0\arcsin u\frac{e^u}{(e^u+1)}du=0
$$
and combining the two equations gives the result. $\Box$ Of course, the problem with this proof is that the equation $x=\arcsin u$ is only valid on $[0,\pi/2]$. However, $\sin{x}$ is invertible on the intervals $[\pi/2,3\pi/2]$ and $[3\pi/2,2\pi]$ so it seems that this problem can be circumvented by splitting the integral up into three integrals and individually applying the $u$-substitution. Can this proof be salvaged? Edit: I'm aware that there are other ways to prove this result. I'm mainly concerned with the validity of this proof. Edit: I've voted up both answers because they give correct proofs. I haven't accepted an answer, however, because neither addresses the issue of breaking up a noninvertible function into seperate integrals where the function is invertible, which was my main reason for posting this question.","['calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'differential-forms', 'real-analysis']"

669280,Why outer measure?,"In constructing the Lebesgue measure we start by defining the outer measure of a set in terms of coverings of the set by countable collection of cubes. Suppose we instead start by approximating sets from the inside. Say, by defining the ""inside measure"" of a set as the supremum of the total volume of any countable collection of disjoint cubes contained in the set. I can see that we would run into problems. For example on $[0,1]$ the set of rationals and set of irrationals would both have ""inside measure"" $0$ whereas the interval as a whole would have ""inside measure"" $1$. What I would like to have is an intuitive understanding of why we run into these problems when approximating from inside whereas approximating from outside gives us a measure theory which works. The reason I am asking is that for simple sets, for eg. when calculating the area of a circle, approximating from outside and approximating from inside works equally well.",['measure-theory']

669306,Definition of the Energy of a curve,"The energy of a curve $c: I \to S$ assuming S is a regular surface with a Riemannian metric $g$ is defined as : $$ E[c] = \frac{1}{2} \int_I g_{c(t)}(\dot c(t),\dot c(t))\mathsf{dt} $$ This is quite similar to the definition of the length in terms of the defining functions i.e.: $$L[c] = \int_I \sqrt{g_{c(t)} (\dot c(t), \dot c(t) )}\mathsf{dt}$$
I proved that the former is not an invariant under reparametrisation while the latter is. And moreover a parametrisation proportional to arc length is desirable to minimise energy. However I wish for a more physical connotation to this result. Also rather vaguely, why is the energy functional defined thus? The definition of length is motivated by partitions and taking limits and gives rise to the distance metric as the infimum of the lengths of all possible curves connecting two points. Would it be feasible to incorporate the energy here?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

Let $f:\mathbb R^2\rightarrow \mathbb R$ be differentiable.
At $(1,2)$ $f$ has directional derivative $2$ in the direction towards $(2,2)$ and $-2$ in the direction towards $(1,-1)$.

          direction vector from $(1,2)$ to $(1,-1)$ is $(0,-3)$. direction vector from $(1,2)$ to $(4,6)$ is $(3,4)$.

669334,Why should we use the Fourier Transform?,"I'm a CS/Math double major, and during my study (and reading sources out of my own interest) I've had some encounters with the Fourier Transform. I understand the theory behind Fourier series, and why the integral to calculate the coefficients works. (Nevertheless, my understanding is obviously far from complete; I feel the topics that I ask about are kind of basic). I basically understand/view the Fourier transform as an extension from the calculations from the discrete coefficients to the real numbers. Instead of a coefficient for each natural number, we have a coefficient for each positive real number. I have some questions about this approach. My first question is: why does the Fourier transform make sense? How do we know the Fourier transform spikes at the right spots and not at spots inbetween natural numbers? Further, the Fourier transform obviously seems have some nice properties, otherwise people wouldn't use it so much. What are the cons of using the Fourier transform as opposed to using the Fourier series?","['fourier-series', 'fourier-analysis', 'analysis']"
