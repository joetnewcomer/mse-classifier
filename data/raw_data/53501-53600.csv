567784,How does a smooth structure on a subset of a manifold determine its status as an immersed submanifold?,"As titles are limited to 150 characters, allow me to rephrase my question in a way that is hopefully more precise: Given a $d$-dimensional smooth manifold $M$ and some $k$-dimensional subset $S\subset M$, how does a smooth structure on $S$ turn $S$ into an immersed submanifold (or alternatively, prevent $S$ from being an immersed submanifold)? I have the following definition: $S\subset M$ is an immersed submanifold if there exists a smooth manifold structure on $S$ such that the inclusion $i:S\hookrightarrow M$ is a smooth immersion. Continuing, $i$ is a smooth immersion if $i$ is a smooth map between $S$ and $M$ (which in this case, it must be) and $di_a: T_aU\to T_{i(a) }M$ is injective for all $a\in U$. At first glance, I have a difficult time seeing where the smooth structure you build on $S$ even comes into play (just to be more clear about what I mean when I just say ""building a smooth structure on $S$"", I mean to give $S$ with some atlas of smooth charts $\varphi_i:S\to\mathbb{R}^k$). Though after giving it some thought, the smooth structure you build determines a topology on $S$, and as $i$ is continuous, you would need the inverse images of open sets in $M$ to be open in $S$, something which would need to be facilitated by the smooth structure you pick. Is this the correspondence between the two notions, or is there something more I'm completely missing? In summary, my thoughts on the matter are as follows: The smooth structure you build determines a topology on the subset $S$, and you need this topology to satisfy certain properties in order to allow $i$ to be a smooth immersion. Any input is welcome!","['differential-topology', 'geometry', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

567802,How can I transform the fuction $x=y$ under the complex function $f(z)=z^2+z$?,"How can I transform the fuction $x=y$ under the complex function $f(z)=z^2+z$??? First I define the horizontals and verticals lines of the complex plane. Then if $z=x+iy$ the function $z^2+z=x^2-y^2+2ixy+x+iy$. There is a horizontal line $l_1$, exists $c_1\in R$ such that $l_1$ is represented by $y=c_1$, for any $z\in l_1$ then $z=x+ic_1$. The next step is $z^2+z=x^2-c^2_1+2c_1ix+x+c_1i$ consequently $u=x^2+c^2_1+x$ and $v=2c_1x+c_1$. When $c_1$ its different to zero then $x=\frac{v-c_1}{2c_1}$ so we have $u=(\frac{v-c_1}{2c_1})^2-c^2_1$ for horizontal lines. Analogously, if $l_2$ its a vertical line, then exists $c_2\in R$ such that $l_2$ is represented by $x=c_2$, for any $z\in l_2$ then $z=c_2+iy$. The next step is $z^2+z=c^2_2-y^2+2c_2iy+c_2+iy$ consequently $u=c^2_2-y^2+c_2$ and $v=2c_2y+y$ when $c_2$ its different to zero then $y=\dfrac{v}{2c_2+1}$ so we have $u=c^2_2-(\frac{v}{2c_2+1})^2+c_2$ for vertical lines. Then the complex map is Now if I have the function $x=y$. Then $z^2+z=x^2-x^2+2ix^2+x+ix=x+i(2x^2+x)$. I have a doubt about if my conversion is correct.

567806,Bernoulli distribution vs the probability mass function,"What is the difference between the two? They seem to mean the same thing to me. The probability mass function can be used to find the probability of getting a tail from a coin flip: X{1 tail}=P(X)=P(H),P(T)=1/2 The Bernoulli distribution equation goes like: (1/2)^1(1-.5)^(1-1)=1/2 because p(success) is 1/2, and p(failure) is 1-(1/2). Are they the same thing? If not what types of problems would one shine over the other? I know that we can use the Bernoulli distribution as the basis of the Binomial distribution to find the number of tails in n trials but is that it? Is the difference that the bernouli distribution equation can be used to find n tails until a head comes up? Are the bernoulli and the probability mass function just used for the probability of a fixed random variable X, which is a subset of the bionomial distribution?","['discrete-mathematics', 'random-variables', 'probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

The idea in the paper is to change of variable of polar coordinates, but the technique is  useful when $b=c=0$, however for arbitrary $b$ and $c$, I try the same technique, which integrates over $z$ and $y$ first, and run into integral like change of variable

568037,Theorem 4.2.21 in Liu: Regular closed point in a geometrically reduced algebraic variety,"I dont't understant the beggining of the proof of theorem 4.2.21 in Liu. Theorem: A geometricaly reduced algebraic variety X contain always a regular closed point. The proof begin in saying that we can suppose that X is affine and integral and I don't understand why. I explain my ideas, wich can be totaly out of the right way... For integral I had the idea to take an irreducible compponent Y of X such that $\operatorname{dim}X=\operatorname{dim}Y$. Then Y is integral because irreducible and reduced (geometricaly reduced imply reduced). If Y has a regular closed point $y$ then $y$ is closed in $X$ but why is it regular in $X$? As $y$ is closed then (2.5.24) $\operatorname{dim}\mathcal{O}_{Y,y}=\operatorname{dim}Y=\operatorname{dim}X$ but we don't have $\operatorname{dim}T_{X,y}=\operatorname{dim}T_{Y,y}$ but only $\operatorname{dim}T_{X,y}\geqslant\operatorname{dim}T_{Y,y}$ wich proove that $\operatorname{dim}\mathcal{O}_{X,y}\leqslant\operatorname{dim}T_{X,y}$ wich is always right. I don't see how obtain $\operatorname{dim}\mathcal{O}_{X,y}=\operatorname{dim}T_{X,y}$. But maybe I'm not in the right way. For affine I had the idea to take a minimal (finite) affine covering $(U_i)_i$. Let $i_0$ with $\operatorname{dim}U_{i_0}=\operatorname{dim}X$. With minimality we have $F:=X\setminus\cup_{i\neq i_0}U_i\neq\emptyset$ and $F\subseteq U_{i_0}$. As $F$ is closed in $U_{i_0}$ then it is affine. If $F$ has a regular closed point $x$ then $x$ is closed in $X$, but the problem is to show the regularity in $X$. My idea was regular in $F\Rightarrow$ regular in $U_{i_0}\Rightarrow$ regular in $X$. I see wy the second is write but not the first: I don't have information about $\operatorname{dim}F$ nor $\mathcal{O}_{F,x}$.

I have two question relating to this which I've bolded below. Attempt to answer (*) $f$ has degree $4 \ge 2$ so if $f$ has a root then $f$ is reducible. Well the rational root test says that if $\exists$ a rational root $\frac{p}{q}$ with $p, q$ coprime then $p|a_0$ and $q|a_n$ . Hence the potential rational roots are $\pm 1$ . Neither of these are roots so $f$ does not have a root. But (*) only says that if $f$ has a root then $f$ is reducible, it does not imply that if $f$ does not have a root then $f$ is irreducible. Is this correct? Now we can't apply Eisenstein's irreducibility criterion theorem as there is no prime $p$ such that $p\mid a_0, a_1,..., a_{n-1}$ $p \nmid a_n$ $p^2 \nmid a_0$ So where do we go from here? One other fact I am aware of is that if $f$ is primitive, which it is, $f$ irreducible in $Q[x] \iff f$ is irreducible in $Z[x]$ . But I don't see how that can help me here.

568513,Is a set closed under finite intersections?

To make the problem accessible for these who have not read my book , I will define it in elementary terms: $\operatorname{GR} ( \Delta \times^{\mathsf{FCD}} \Delta)$ is a set of binary relations on $\mathbb{R}$ defined by the formula: $$f \in \operatorname{GR} ( \Delta \times^{\mathsf{FCD}} \Delta) \Leftrightarrow
\forall X \in \mathscr{P} \mathbb{R} : ( (\forall D \in \Delta : X \cap D \neq

Wolfram and Wikipedia (citing ""Chow's theorem"") give the statement without proof. The converse is trivial of course. Solution (paraphrasing Georges below ).

I could not find a suitable integral in DLMF or Gradshteyn—Ryzhik or Prudnikov tables of integrals. Mathematica was not able to evaluate it either, even when the parameter $q$ was fixed to an integer ( Note : In Mathematica you would write EllipticK[x^2] for $K(x)$ because of a different convention for the modulus parameter). But , numerical integration and lookups in WolframAlpha and ISC+ suggest that there are closed forms for (at least some) postitive integer values of the parameter $q$. For example, $$\mathcal{J}_1\stackrel?=\frac{7\,\zeta(3)}4,\ \mathcal{J}_2\stackrel?=\frac{7\,\zeta(3)}8+\frac14,\\\mathcal{J}_3\stackrel?=\frac{77\,\zeta(3)}{128}+\frac{17}{64},\ \mathcal{J}_4\stackrel?=\frac{119\,\zeta(3)}{256}+\frac{881}{3456},\tag2$$
where $\zeta(3)$ is the Apéry constant .
It looks that the general formula for postitive integer values of $q$ is
$$\mathcal{J}_q\stackrel?=a_q\,\zeta(3)+b_q,\tag3$$
where $a_q,\,b_q$ are some rational coefficients. I tried to find general formulae for these coefficients, and actually discovered plausible candidates for both. Conjecturally, $a_q$ can be expressed in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function :
$$a_q\stackrel?=\frac{7\,\pi}4\cdot\frac{{_4F_3}\left(\begin{array}{c}\frac12,\,\frac12,\,1-q,\,1-q\\1,\,\frac32-q,\,\frac32-q\end{array}\middle|\ 1\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac32-q\right)^2\ \Gamma(q)^2}.\tag4$$
Somewhat suprisingly, this scarish expression seems to evaluate only to rationals for all $q\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. For $b_q$ I found only a conjectural recurrence relation:
$$b_1\stackrel?=0,\ b_2\stackrel?=\frac14,\ b_q\stackrel?=\frac{2 \,(2\,q-3)\,\left(2\,q^2-6\,q+5\right)\cdot b_{q-1}-4\,(q-2)^3\cdot b_{q-2}+1}{4\,(q-1)^3},\tag5$$
but I could not find a general term formula for it. Can we prove that the closed forms shown in $(2)$ are correct?

Approach 2: Proceed as usual, obtaining $\mu*\nu$ a probability measure on $[0,2]$, then use the bijection $x \mapsto 2x$ between $[0,1]$ and $[0,2]$ to get a measure defined only on $[0,1]$; i.e. define $\mu \# \nu ([a,b]) = \mu*\nu([2a,2b])$.

Let me explain, they don´t have researchers, a decent teachers, the content (I mean the content in the subject is very low in quality if you compare with more prestiges universities in Mexico like ITAM, UNAM). Besides, they assign you a ""teacher"" and when you ask him a question (by email) never respond you, so it is on you to learn mathematics. After that, i´m here to ask for help,tips and recommendation about books, pages or materials that help me to learn very well, with the condition that these materials have to be very well explained, remember I´m learning myself.

For clarification, when I say ""watch course"" it means i already got the lectures, homeworks and exams for the three subjects. I´m taking other subjects but it is about economics and history in Mexico, so for this purpose it doesn´t matter. If any could help me about where i can get introductory materials about this subject I will be really thankful. What do you think about these courses and books? may be a better introductory book or video course?, advices about how to learn mathematics?.

Recently a friend was doing some computer animation work that involved a sine wave with an amplitude and period that were functions of time. Let's call value $V$, amplitude $a$, period $p$, time $t$. He ran into a classic problem where he was doing: $$
V(t)=a(t)\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{p(t)}\right)
$$ With $t$ set to the elapsed time since the start of the program, i.e. $t=t_\text{now}-t_\text{start}$. The problem, of course, is that as $p(t)$ changed, all sorts of artifacts were visible and the sine wave did not smoothly transition in apparent speed. He asked how to solve this problem. I explained to him that he instead needed to work with the current phase instead of absolute time, incrementing each frame based on the period, like so (initializing $t$ to 0): $$
t = t + \frac{\Delta t}{p(t)}
$$
$$
V(t)=a(t)\sin(2\pi t)
$$ Then I awkwardly launched into some explanation (that ultimately required a pen and paper) about how you want to ""smoothly move around the circle, incrementing so that changes in speed don't jump to far away positions"" rather than ""jumping between graphs of sine waves of different frequencies"" or something. In the end he got it, and fortunately he intuitively understood what I was trying to say, but I did a really poor job of explaining it. So my first question is, and apologies if this is asking too much, but how would you explain this to somebody, succinctly, using proper math terms? I realize there are many answers, but currently I know 0 answers. How can I explain to somebody why incrementing the phase based on $\Delta{t}$ and $p(t)$ leads to continuity, while calculating the value based on the total elapsed time doesn't? My second question is this: My friend then asked me, ""do I need to do the same with amplitude?"" The answer is no (assume that the ""continuity"" of $a(t)$ is ""good enough""). I couldn't explain why, though. I mean, intuitively, I knew why, and I said, ""No. I don't know the math term for it but the $a(t)$ is outside the $\sin()$ so it works out."" What are the words I was looking for there? How can I explain to somebody that $a(t)$ doesn't suffer the same problem as the $t/p(t)$ did? I know it has something to do with the way $\sin(x)$ varies with $x$, but I don't know the proper way to describe it. My third question is that at some point during this process I was explaining why the two equations above were identical for a constant $p(t)$. My explanation involved something like, ""Well, I mean, the elapsed time is the same as all of the delta times added together, so you can see if you pull these terms out of the $\sin()$ and increment instead, the value is the same."" Even typing that, it makes very little, if any, sense. On paper I wrote: The original: $$t=t_\text{now}-t_\text{start}$$ $$\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{p(t)}\right)$$ Is the same as: $$t=t+\Delta t$$ $$\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{p(t)}\right)$$ Is the same as: $$t=t+\frac{\Delta t}{p(t)}$$ $$\sin\left(2\pi t\right)$$ When $p(t)$ is a constant function. ... but I couldn't explain why . How can I explain to somebody that incrementing by deltas every frame is the same as the difference between the current frame and the first frame? Is there some terminology that fully encapsulates this so that an example is not necessary? Heck, I don't even know what the fundamental problem is called, I always just refer to it as an ""artifact"" in a generic sense. How would you explain this problem and its solution to somebody? Note: I realize I am liberally interchanging ""time"" (i.e. seconds) and ""phase"" above -- this is really just another symptom of my inability to express these thoughts clearly. Update: I have created two JavaScript demos that try and illustrate the problem: Example 1: Period is linear function of x (i.e. time) Example 2: Period is step function of x (i.e. time) Sorry, the examples are no longer online (11/11/15). The first example is a more typical case in my experience. The second example shows the problem very sharply and may be more illustrative. Basically, my question is: How could I explain why the incorrect approach is incorrect, and why the correct approach is correct, without using pictures or animated examples, but instead with proper and clear mathematical language?","['continuity', 'discrete-mathematics', 'terminology']"
568752,Curvature of the Archimedean spiral in polar coordinates,"Let's take a look on the Archimedean spiral. The parametric equation  is: $$c : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R^{2} \,;\, c(t) := (t\cos(t), t\sin(t))$$ The goal of the exercise is to compute the curvature of the spiral in polar coordinates.  What I've tried? I convert the parametric equation into polar coordinates: $$x(\varphi) = r(\varphi)\cos(\varphi)$$ $$y(\varphi) = r(\varphi)\sin(\varphi)$$ Is that correct so far? I know how to compute the curvature with the parametric equation, that's not the point. But how I can do it with the polar coordinates? Thanks in advance",['geometry']

Indeed, I observed that $I(r, 0) = 0$ and $$\frac{\partial I}{\partial s}(r, s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \left\{ \frac{2\sqrt{y}}{(r-s)y^{2} + 2(2-r)y + (r+s)}+\frac{2\sqrt{y}}{(r+s)y^{2}+ 2(2-r)y + (r-s)} \right\} \,\mathrm dy, $$ which can be evaluated using standard contour integration technique. But simplifying the residue and integrating them seems still daunting. EDIT. By applying a series of change of variables, I noticed that the problem is equivalent to prove that $$ \tilde{I}(\alpha, s) := \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{x}\sqrt{\frac{1+x}{1-x}} \log \left( \frac{ 1 + 2sx \sin\alpha + (s^{2} - \cos^{2}\alpha) x^{2}}{ 1 - 2sx \sin\alpha + (s^{2} - \cos^{2}\alpha) x^{2}} \right) \, \mathrm dx = 4\pi \alpha $$ for $-\frac{\pi}{2} < \alpha < \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $s > 1$. (This is equivalent to the condition that the expression inside the logarithm is positive for all $x \in \Bbb{R}$.) Another simple observation. once you prove that $\tilde{I}(\alpha, s)$ does not depend on the variable $s$ for $s > 1$, then by suitable limiting process it follows that $$ \tilde{I}(\alpha, s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \log \left( \frac{ 1 + 2x \sin\alpha + x^{2}}{ 1 - 2x \sin\alpha + x^{2}} \right) \, \frac{\mathrm dx}{x}, $$ which (I guess) can be calculated by hand. The following graph may also help us understand the behavior of this integral.","['definite-integrals', 'closed-form', 'calculus', 'integration']"

But I came across the following from Keisler's book ""Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach"". ""We have no way of knowing what a line in physical space is really
  like. It might be like the hyperreal line, the real line, or neither.
  However, in applications of the calculus, it is helpful to imagine a
  line in physical space as a hyperreal line."" We get real number answers to physical problems in distance, from integers to transcendental numbers. However, we never get a nonzero number $w$ s.t. $w \lt 1/k, \forall k \in \mathbb N$ coming from a physical calculation, theoretical or applied. Isn't this what makes physical distances real and not hyperreal? Is it really possible that our space was never (locally) Euclidean all this time? Where are these infinitesmals and why are they hiding? Secondly, we say the real line, by construction from completing the rationals, has ""no holes"". Yet, the reals are a proper subfield of the hyperreals. Where do these infinitesmals ""fit"" on the real line to make a hyperreal line when there is no room for them to fit? In other words, if we begin by assuming a physical line segment is a hyperreal line segment and then (mathematically) remove all the infinitesmals, we get a hyperreal line segment with ""holes"" in the form of missing hyperreal points, but this just gives a real line segment, which has no holes. There seems to be problems in assuming physical lines can be hyperreal lines.","['nonstandard-analysis', 'calculus', 'infinitesimals', 'soft-question']"

I need to find a way to make the second two terms zero. I'm trying to do it by integration by parts, noting that the last two terms can be written as $$\left.f'g\right]_{x-t}^{x+t}$$ or $$\int_{x-t}^{x+t} f''g+g'f',$$ but this isn't getting me anywhere.","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-differential-equations', 'wave-equation']"
