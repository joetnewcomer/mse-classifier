294150,Motivation behind the definition of ideal class group,"Let $O$ be a Dedekind domain and $K$ its field of fractions. The set of all fractional ideals of $K$ form a group, the ideal group $J_K$ of K. The fractional principal ideals $(a) = aO, a \in K^*$, form a subgroup of the
  group of ideals $J_K$, which will be denoted $P_K$. The quotient group
  $$CL_K=J_K/P_K$$ is called the ideal class group of $K$. This definition looks completely arbitary, I fail to see why the class group or the ideal class group is worth studying. So, why is the class group or ideal class group interesting? I've read that ideal class group ""measures"" how much unique factorization fails in a domain, but I don't understand how it does so. This from Algebraic Number Theory by Neukirch. The class group $C_K$ measures the expansion that takes place when we pass from numbers to ideals, whereas the unit group $O^*$ measures the contraction in the same process. This immediately raises the problem of understanding these
  groups $O^*$ and $C_K$ more thoroughly. I don't understand the above paragraph. What does it mean by  ""the expansion that takes place when we pass from numbers to ideals""? And why should we even bother about such ""expansion""?","['ideal-class-group', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"
294171,How to check the strong ergodicity of the $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$-action on the torus?,"Suppose $\Gamma\subset SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is a non-amenable subgroup, especially, $\Gamma=SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Consider the natural action of $\Gamma$ on $S^1\times S^1=T^2$. How to check that this action is strongly ergodic? ($T^2$ is equipped with the Haar measure). Recall that an action $\Gamma\curvearrowright (X,\mu)$ is called strongly ergodic if for every sequence of measurable sets $A_n\subset X$ such that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\mu(A_n\Delta\gamma A_n)=0,\forall \gamma\in \Gamma$, we have that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\mu(A_n)(1-\mu(A_n))=0$. Note that since $T^2$ is considered as the Pontryagin dual of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, we know that for any $f\in T^2$, such that $f(n,m)=z_1^nz_2^m, (z_2,z_2)\in T^2\forall (n,m)\in\mathbb{Z}^2$, then, for $$\gamma=\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix},$$ $\gamma f$ satisfies $(\gamma f)(n,m)=(z_1^az_2^c)^n(z_1^bz_2^d)^m$. But how to check the strong ergodicity condition? Since I do not know how to calculate $\mu(A_n\Delta\gamma A_n)$ in practice.

Now chain rule:
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial a} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial b}\frac{\partial b}{\partial a} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial c}\frac{\partial c}{\partial a} = \text{this equals to the above}.$$ So, what's wrong with this?","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"

So we'd just have $(L+N)/N = L/N$, so why would he bother to use $(L+N)/N$ instead of $L/N$?

294224,"A theorem about Cesàro mean, related to Stolz-Cesàro theorem","Original Title: Tauberian theorems and Cesàro sum Theorem (Landau-Hardy, From Rudin's Principle of Mathematical Analysis Exercise 3.14) $\newcommand\abs[1]{\left\lvert#1\right\rvert}$
If $\{s_n\}$ is a complex sequence, define its arithmetic means $\sigma_n$ by
$$\sigma_n=\frac{s_0+s_1+\dotsb+s_n}{n+1}\qquad(n=0,1,2,\dotsc)$$
Put $a_n=s_n-s_{n-1}$ for $n\ge1$.
Assume $M<+\infty$ and $\abs{na_n}\le M$ for all $n$, and $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sigma_n=\sigma$, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}s_n=\sigma$. The outline of the proof If $m<n$, then
$$s_n-\sigma_n=\frac{m+1}{n-m}(\sigma_n-\sigma_m)+\frac1{n-m}\sum_{k=m+1}^n(s_n-s_k)\tag{*}$$
Notice that $\abs{s_n-s_k}\le(n-m-1)M\,/\,(m+2)$, fix $\epsilon>0$ and associate with each $n$ the integer $m$ that satisfies
$$m\le\frac{n-\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}<m+1$$

Suppose $U$ is homeomorphic to an open set $V$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ via homeomorphism $f$. Now if we remove the $x$-axis from $S$ then it will have $4$ connected components, so if we can show that removal of the image of $x$-axis from $V$ can leave at most three connected components then we are through, is it the case? Another approach : if we remove the point $p$ from $S$, then the fundamental group of the resulting space is same as the fundamental group of $X:=\lbrace (x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^3 : z=0 \mbox{ and } x^2+y^2=1,\mbox{ or } y=0\mbox{ and } x^2+z^2=1\rbrace$. Can the two fundamental groups $\pi_1(X)$ and $\pi_1(V\setminus \lbrace f^{-1}(p)\rbrace )$ be same?

aces can be high or low, if you are dealt a five-card hand, what is the probability that it will be a straight with high card 10? What is the probability that it will be a straight?
What is the probability that it will be a straight flush (all cards in the same suit)? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- First, I calculated the number of possible 5-card hands that can be dealt out: ${{52}\choose{5}}=2598960$. To answer the first question, I imagined how the cards could be dealt out to generate a straight, since order doesn't matter. I know that, to make a straight, Jacks , Queens, Kings, Aces, 1s, 2s ,3s 4s, and 5s are out of the question. So, if I was dealt a 10, there would be 4 choices (two black and two red); and since either a red or a black will be chosen, then there are only two possibilities for the 9. If the 10 happened to be hearts or diamonds, then the the 9 would have to be a spades or clubs. Using this reasoning for the rest of them, I calculated that there would $4⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅2=64$ different straight hands with 10 as the highest card. Thus, the probability would be $64/2598960=.000024625$. However, the answer is .000394. What did I do wrong?

294885,What is the norm of the gradient of $f$ in normal coordinate?,"Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold and $f$ a smooth function on $M$. The Bochner formula proved in Schoen-Yau's book ""lectures in Differential Geometry"": (prop. 2.2)
$$
\Delta |\nabla f|^2(p)=2\sum _{ij} |f_{ij}|^2 +2 R_{ij}f_i f_j +2 \sum f_i(\Delta f)_i
$$
The proof assumes that ${x_i}$ are normal coordinates around $p$. and $f_i$ is the co variant differential of $f$ with respect to $\partial/\partial x_i$. $R_{ij}$ is the Ricci tensor. Then the proof proceed as follows: Since $|\nabla f|^2=\sum f_i^2$. Hence at $p$ one has
$$
\Delta |\nabla f|^2 =\sum_j(\sum f_i^2)_{jj}=.....
$$ My question is actually the first claim $$|\nabla f|^2=\sum f_i^2$$
It seems for my that in general $$\nabla f=f_sg^{si}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$$
In normal coordinate we can only get the expression $|\nabla f|^2=\sum f_i^2$ only holds at the point $p$, not other points. But clearly we need to take derivative, the value at the point $p$ is not enough. It's most likely I miss some point here, but I can't figure out why.

294894,Finding the limit of a piecewise function,"I had a question about finding limits of piecewise functions through graphs. I believe, I am missing something in my fundamentals about finding limits for these functions. Firstly, I would like to confirm that the empty dot represents a ""hole"" and the point is not included in the function of the line. For example, line closest to $h(x)$ is an example. Therefore, a coloured in dot represents a point that is on the graph e.g. $(3,2)$. So now for my main question How do I determine the limit of a $x$ that has two $y$'s? For example, the $\lim_{x\to 3^+} h(x)$ The back of the book says the answer is 3 but how can that be the case when, to my knowledge, an empty dot means that the point is hole? Or if that is not the case, then why is the answer not 2? If someone could please clear this up for me, that would be great. Thanks for the help!

Since 
$\frac{\sqrt{n}[\bar{X}-\lambda]}{\sigma}$ appraches N(0,1) in distribution by CLT, and since $(\frac{\sigma}{S})$ appraches 1 in probability, the whole thing approaches N(0,1). For $\frac{\sqrt{n}[\bar{X}-\lambda]}{\sqrt{\bar{X}}}$, we get the same result...since the mean is equal to the variance in a poisson distribution. 2) I'm a little confused about this one... 3) From a theorem in my textbook, I know that if $\sqrt{n}(X_n - \theta) \rightarrow N(0,\sigma^2)$ and if there is a differentiable function g(x) at theta where the derivative at theta is not zero...then $\sqrt{n}(g(X_n)-g(\theta)) \rightarrow N(0,\sigma^2(g'(\theta))^2)$.

The key to the problem would be to show that a and b must both have and odd power of 3 in their prime factorization. The outline of my proof for the above specific case is as follows: Note that $a,b$ cannot both be perfect squares. We write $a=3^{k_1}\alpha, b=3^{k_2}\beta$, where $3∤α,β$ By considering congruences, prove that $k_1, k_2$ must be of the same parity. Considering the case where $k_1, k_2$ are both even $\alpha,\beta$ cannot both be perfect squares. By squaring both sides of the original equation, we find that $\sqrt{\alpha\beta}$ must be rational, and thus it must be an integer too. Expressing ${\alpha, \beta}$ as products of perfect squares and square free integers, we find that their square free components must be equal. Denote this square free component as $f$. $12\sqrt{3}=C\sqrt{f}$, where $C$ is an integer. Then $f=3$, which is a contradiction. An alternative, shorter proof by a friend: Note that $ab$ is perfect square. $a=0, b=0$ each give 1 solution. Otherwise, $a,b>0$. Let $d=gcd(a, b)$. Since $ab$ is a perfect square, $a={x^2}d, b={y^2}d$ for some relatively prime positive integers x, y. ${(x+y)^2}d=432$, allowing one to calculate the number of positive integer solutions.
