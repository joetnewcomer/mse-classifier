725232,Groups statements equivalence,"Problem statement Let $G$ be a group and $H \subset G$ a subset. Prove that the following statements are equivalent (i) $H$ is a subgroup (ii) $H$ is nonempty and for any $x, y \in H, xy^{-1} \in H$ If $G$ is finite, prove that these statements are equivalent to (iii) $H$ is nonempty and for any $x,y \in H, xy \in H$ The attempt at a solution I didn't have problems to show the equivalence of statements (i) and (ii): $(i) \implies (ii) $ This is by definition, since if $H$ is a subgroup, then is closed under operation, so it satisfies $xz \in H$ for all elements in $H$, in particular, for $z=y^{-1}$. $(ii) \implies (i)$ is also easy: To prove the existence of $e \in H$, we can write $e=xx^{-1}$ for any $x \in H$ (we can assure there exists some $x$ since $H$ is non-empty).Now that we've proved the existence of the identity element, by hypothesis, if $x \in H$, then $ex^{-1}=x^{-1} \in H$, so all the elements have inverse in $H$. We prove closure of the operation just by using that $y={y^{-1}}^{-1}$, by hypothesis, $xy=x{y^{-1}}^{-1} \in H$. Associativity follows directly from the fact that $G$ is a group. Now, $(i),(ii) \implies (iii)$ is immediate, by definition of group, we have that $H$ is closed under the operation, so, for any $x,y \in H, xy \in H$. I got stuck trying to show that $(iii)$ implies $H$ is a subgroup. If I could prove that for any $x \in H$, $x^{-1} \in H$, then I would be done but I don't know how to show this. I thought to prove it by the absurd: suppose there is an element $x : x^{-1} \notin H$, then how I could conclude that $G$ cannot be finite?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

725252,Do I correctly understand the constructions involved in definition of Cartier divisor?,"Let $(X,\mathcal O)$ be a ringed space, where $\mathcal O$ is a sheaf of unital commutative integrity domains. Let $\widetilde{\mathcal M}_U$ be the field of fractions of ring $\mathcal O_U$ for any open $U$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal M}$ be the presheaf given by $\widetilde M_U$ over an open $U$. Sheafification $\mathcal M$ of $\widetilde{\mathcal M}$ is called the sheaf of meromorphic functions on $X$. Its sections over an open $U$ will be denoted by $\mathcal M_U$. Then $\mathcal O_U$ is naturally included in $\mathcal M_U$. Now let $\mathcal O^\times$ and $\mathcal M^\times$ be the sheaves of multiplicative groups of invertible elements of $\mathcal O$ and $\mathcal M$. Again, $\mathcal O_U^\times \subset \mathcal M_U^\times$. We can consider the sheaf $\mathcal M^\times / \mathcal O^\times$. Its global sections are called Cartier divisors. If I'm not mistaken, any section of $\mathcal M$ over an open $U$ is given by an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $U$ together with a family of elements $\{f_i / g_i \mid f_i, g_i \in \mathcal O_{U_i}$, $g_i \neq 0 \}$ and such that 
$$
  f_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} g_j|_{U_i \cap U_j} - g_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} f_j|_{U_i \cap U_j} = 0
$$
 if $U_i \cap U_j \neq \varnothing$.Thus the inclusion $\mathcal O_U \to \mathcal M_U$ for any $f \in \mathcal O_U$ is given by the data of the single set $U_1 = U$ and of a single fraction with $f_1 = f$, $g_1 = 1_{\mathcal O_U}$. Then any section of $\mathcal M^\times / \mathcal O^\times$ over an open $U$ is given by an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $U$ together with a family of elements $\{f_i / g_i \cdot \mathcal O_U^\times|_{U_i} \mid f_i, g_i \in \mathcal O_{U_i}$, $f_i, g_i \neq 0 \}$ each of which represents a set and such that 
$$
f_i|_{U_i \cap U_j}/ g_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} \cdot \mathcal O^\times_U |_{U_i \cap U_j} = f_j|_{U_i \cap U_j} / g_j|_{U_i \cap U_j} \cdot O^\times_U |_{U_i \cap U_j} \tag{1}

If we show the above factors are coprime, saying that they are the 5th powers of some ideal doesn't help much, since we know that the 5th power of any ideal is a principal ideal due to the class group being $C_5$. -How does ""3"" come into play?","['algebraic-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
725297,About B. Ya Levin's proof that $|f(x)| \leq M$ implies $|f(x+iy)| \leq Me^{\sigma y}$,"This question is about Theorems 1 through 3 on pages 37-38 of B. Ya Levin's Lectures on Entire Functions , available on Google Books . If you can't access the Google Books link there is also a screenshot of the relevant portion of the book available here: https://i.sstatic.net/8f9kV.jpg I'm trying to understand the proofs of these three theorems for the case where the hypotheses of Theorem 3 are satisfied. In Theorem 3, $f$ is a function analytic in $\operatorname{Im} z \geq 0$ which is bounded on the real axis by a constant, $M$.  Further, there is a positive number $\sigma$ such that, for any $\epsilon > 0$, the bound $$
|f(z)| < e^{(\sigma + \epsilon)|z|}
$$ holds for $|z|$ large enough with $\operatorname{Im} z > 0$.  The theorem states that, for such an $f$, $$
|f(x+iy)| \leq M e^{\sigma y}
$$ for all $x+iy \in \mathbb C$ with $y \geq 0$. To prove Theorem 3, the author recommends applying Theorem 2 with $\alpha = \pi/2$ and $\rho = 1$ to the rotated function $f(iz)$.  (Actually the author suggests using $f(-iz)$ instead, but I believe this is a typo.  This function is not analytic for $\operatorname{Re} z > 0$, which is a requirement of Theorem 2.) Now in Theorem 2, the author defines $$
D = \left\{z : |\arg z| < \alpha = \frac{\pi}{2\rho}\right\} = \{z:\operatorname{Re}z > 0\}
$$ and $$
\varphi_\epsilon(z) = f(iz)e^{-(\sigma + \epsilon)z}.
$$ The function $\varphi_\epsilon$ is bounded by $M$ on the boundary of $D$, since $$
|\varphi_\epsilon(ix)| = \left|f(-x) e^{i(\sigma + \epsilon)x}\right| \leq M.
$$ Further, it tends to zero along the positive real axis.  Indeed, for $|z|$ large enough we have $|f(z)| < e^{(\sigma + \epsilon/2)|z|}$, so for $x > 0$ large enough we see that $$
|\varphi_\epsilon(x)| < e^{(\sigma+\epsilon/2)x}e^{-(\sigma+\epsilon)x} = e^{-x\epsilon/2}.
$$ Thus there is a constant $C_\epsilon$ such that $$
|\varphi_\epsilon(x)| \leq C_\epsilon
$$ for all $x \geq 0$.  I believe this is what the author means by the first sentence of the proof, The function $\varphi_\epsilon(z)$ is bounded on a positive ray and on the boundary of $D$. I can understand the next line, According to the previous theorem [Theorem 1], it is bounded by a constant in each angle $D_+ = \{z:0<\arg z<\pi/2\}$ and $D_- = \{z:-\pi/2<\arg z<0\}$. Here the author seems to have applied Theorem 1 with $\rho = 1$ and $\lambda = 2$ to $\varphi_\epsilon(z)$ in each of the angles $D_+$ and $D_-$.  It seems that the $M$ in Theorem 1 was taken to be $\max\{M,C_\epsilon\}$.  This is then the constant bound being referred to. I do not understand the next line, Applying the previous theorem once more, we obtain $|\varphi_\epsilon(z)| \leq M$ for $z \in D$. How was the previous theorem applied this time?  How does he conclude that $|\varphi_\epsilon(z)| \leq M$ when we apparently only have $$
|\varphi_\epsilon(z)| \leq \max\{M,C_\epsilon\}?

725335,Help finishing proof via induction for a summation,"So I have to prove the following equation using induction for n >= 2: 
$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n 4/5^i < 1

However the question asks me to prove something stronger such as this:
$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n 4/5^i <= 1 - \frac{1}{5^n}
$$
first to imply the first equation is true.
So far I have the following: Base Case: Let n = 2 $$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^2 4/5^i = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{25} = \frac {24}{25}
$$ 
then I also applied it to 
$$ 1 - \frac{1}{5^n} \rightarrow 1 - \frac{1}{5^2} = \frac{24}{25}$$
Therefore I can make the following assumptions yes? Inductive Hypothesis for all 2 <= n <= k it is 
$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n 4/5^i = 4\frac{\frac{1}{5^n} - 1}{\frac{1}{5} - 1} = 1 - \frac{1}{5^n} < 1
$$ Inductive Step Hopefully I'm ok up to here, I'll show what I have so far for this step. 
$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k+1} 4/5^i = \frac{\frac{1}{5^{k+1}} - 1}{\frac{1}{5} - 1} = 4\frac{(\frac{1}{5^k}-1) * \frac{1}{5} - \frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5} -1} $$
$$
= \frac{1}{5} *   4\frac{(\frac{1}{5^k}) - 1}{\frac{1}{5} -1} -  4\frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{1}{5} - 1}
$$
so here I have:
$$
4\frac{(\frac{1}{5^k}) - 1}{\frac{1}{5} -1}
$$
which I know is:
$$
= \sum\limits_{i=1}^k 4/5^i
$$
which is my inductive hypothesis, I am unsure of how to finish my proof from here... any help correcting or finishing the proof is very much appreciated","['discrete-mathematics', 'education', 'proof-verification', 'induction', 'summation']"
725350,Is Geometric Algebra isomorphic to Tensor Algebra?,"Is geometric algebra (Clifford algebra) isomorphic to tensor algebra?  If so, how then would one relate a unique 2-vector (this is what I'm going to call a multivector that is the sum of a scalar, vector, and bivector) to every 2nd rank tensor? Edit by the OP, converted from ""answer"" Okay.  Well I'm still curious if there's a way to represent any 2nd-rank tensor by a bivector, vector, and scalar.  Or in particular, can any $3 \times 3$ matrix be represented by a 2-vector in 3D. It seems to me that they can't because I would guess the matrix representation of a bivector (grade 2 element of a 2-vector) would be exactly the same as the $3 \times 3$ matrix representation of the cross product (i.e. $[a \times b]_{ij} = a_j b_i - a_i b_j$) which only uniquely identifies 3 components. I would also assume that the scalar part of the 2-vector would be represented by a scalar times the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix.  This would fill in 3 numbers, but really only uniquely gives 1 component. I don't know how to represent the vector component of the 2-vector as a $3 \times 3$ matrix but I don't see how it could identity the remaining 5 components by itself. Am I right then in assuming that there is a canonical matrix representation of a general 2-vector, but that there are matrices that cannot be represented by any 2-vector?","['geometric-algebras', 'clifford-algebras', 'abstract-algebra']"

725434,"LU factorization problem - Writing a code, don't understand partial pivoting","I'm trying to write a matlab code for the following question: The program gets a matrix $A$ (lets say square matrix) and it returns $P,L,U$ such that $PA=PLU$ and $P$ is the permutation matrix, the partial pivoting matrix. The obvious way to go about this is to:
1) find matrix $P$ via switching rows with the maximum value, and then doing gauss eliminiation, and continuing with the row switching. 2) doing regular LU decomposition of $A$ 3) We now have $PA=PLU$ The problem here is that we essential do gauss elimination twice. once to find the $P$ matrix, and then to find $LU$ such that $A=LU$ The second problem, is that the entire point of partial pivoting is so we don't have to find such $LU$ matrices such that $A=LU$ since we don't know how numerically stable it is. So it defeats the point. My problem is this : after switching rows, I don't know what value to put in matrix $L$. For example: $A=\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 & 4\\ 1 & 5 & 9 \\ 9 & 2 & 6\end{pmatrix}$ A row change is needed since $9>3$, so we now have: $P=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}$ and $PA = \begin{pmatrix} 9 & 2 & 6\\1 & 5 & 9\\ 3 & 1 & 4\end{pmatrix}$ Now I somehow need to find the original $L$ that I would get if I hadn't done the row change, by doing gauss elimination on $PA$ and  I don't understand how that's possible. Take heart, we need to find such matrices $L,U$ such that $A=LU$ without actually doing an lu decomposition of $A$, but of the more numerically stable $PA$ rather.

$$f_{x}(3,-1) = sec^2(\frac{\pi}{4}) = 2$$
$$f_{y}(3,-1) = 3sec^2(\frac{\pi}{4}) = 6$$ So the gradient vector for $f$ is $(2,6)$ The letting $u = x + 3y + \frac{\pi}{4}$, I get that $\frac{du}{dx}= 1 $ and $\frac{dy}{dx}= 3 $ So, $$f_{x}(u) = sec^2(u)$$
$$f_{xx}(u) = 2tan(u)sec^2(u)\frac{du}{dx}$$
$$f_{xy}(u) = 2tan(u)sec^2(u)\frac{du}{dy}$$ and similarly, $$f_{y}(u) = 3sec^2(u)$$
$$f_{yx}(u) = 6tan(u)sec^2(u)\frac{du}{dx}$$
$$f_{yy}(u) = 6tan(u)sec^2(u)\frac{du}{dy}$$ Substituting back for $u$ and plugging in $(3,-1)$ I get: $$f_{xx}(3,-1) = 2tan(\frac{\pi}{4})sec^2(\frac{\pi}{4})\cdot1 = 4$$
$$f_{xy}(3,-1) = 2tan(\frac{\pi}{4})sec^2(\frac{\pi}{4})\cdot3 = 12$$ and similarly, $$f_{yx}(3,-1) = 6tan(\frac{\pi}{4})sec^2(\frac{\pi}{4})\cdot1 = 12$$
$$f_{yy}(3,-1) = 6tan(\frac{\pi}{4})sec^2(\frac{\pi}{4})\cdot3 = 36$$ So, $$T_{2}((x,y),(3,-1)) = 1+(2,6) \cdot (x-3,y+1) + \frac{1}{2} \bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}

It's not hard to see that $\sigma$ is injective: If $\sigma(x)=(tx_1,...,tx_n)=(ty_1,...,ty_n)=\sigma(y)$, then $tx_i=ty_i$ for all $i$, so $x_i=y_i$ and $x=y$.

This means that the identity function doesn't need to be in $G$ either. As a simple example, consider the set $T$ of transformations $x\to x+a$, where $a>0$. Each element of this set has an inverse ($x\to x-a$), but neither the inverses nor the identity transformation are members of $T$. So I'm looking for something very roughly like this: A <<insert name here>> is a tuple $\langle G, H, e, \cdot \rangle$, where $G$ is the set of forward elements and $H$ is the set of reverse elements, and $e$ is the identity element. The binary operation $\cdot$ is: closed independently for $G$ and $H$.

It's very similar to a group, but where the elements are partitioned into (possibly overlapping) ""forward"" and ""reverse"" sets that might not contain the identity element. Note that if $g\in G$ and $h\in H$ then $fh$ might not be in either set. In the example above, $G$ is the set of translations in the positive direction and $H$ is the set of translations in the negative direction.

726376,Does this really converge to 1/e? (Massaging a sum),"Short version: can we prove that
$$\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \binom{n}{k}^2 \frac{k!}{n^{2k}} \to \frac1e$$
as $n \to \infty$? Long version: First, consider
$$a_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$$
It is well-known that $a_n \to \dfrac1e$ as $n \to \infty$; indeed $a_n = \dfrac{!n}{n!}$ is the truncation to the first $n$ terms of the power series for $e^x$, evaluated at $x = -1$ (where $!n$ denotes the subfactorial; it is also equal to the number of derangements on $n$ elements). There is also a simple expression for the generating function $A(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n$, which is $A(z) = \dfrac{e^{-z}}{1-z}$. (See Exponential Generating Functions For Derangements .) Next, consider
$$b_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{n^{\underline k}}{n^k} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$$
where $n^{\underline k} = \binom{n}{k}k!$ denotes a falling factorial, so the extra factor $\frac{n^{\underline k}}{n^k}$ is $\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{n(n)\cdots(n)} = 1\cdot\left(1 - \frac1n\right)\cdot\left(1 - \frac2n\right)\cdots\left(1 - \frac{k-1}n\right)$ which for large $n$ (and fixed $k$) is close to $1$. 
I don't know if $b_n$ has a simple form for its generating function too, but it is easy to see that $b_n \to \dfrac1e$ as well; indeed by the binomial theorem we have $b_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (\frac{-1}{n})^k = \left(1 - \frac1n \right)^n$ which is well-known to converge to $\frac1e$ (indeed such a limit is sometimes taken to be the definition of $e^x$). Finally, consider
$$c_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{n^{\underline k}}{n^k} \frac{n^{\underline k}}{n^k} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$$ This is the same transformation going from $b_n$ to $c_n$ as from $a_n$ to $b_n$. But can we prove that $c_n \to \frac1e$ too? (And can we write down its generating function compactly, perchance?) More generally, what techniques exist that help in proving something about $\sum t_n s_n$, given $\sum s_n$? This question arose from an attempt to answer this question , where I arrived at the expression $c_n$ above (there I called it $P_{n, n, 0}$; next I'll try to understand $P_{m, w, k}$).

How does this incorrect notation do such a good job ensuring that we do not disobey the ""reverse chain rule"" and ensures that our integrand is in the form $f'(g(x))\,g'(x)$ ? People often say that it is very suggestive and I am wondering how. Excuse the LaTeX if it looks weird. This is my first time using it.","['calculus', 'integration', 'notation', 'math-history', 'differential']"
726976,Solve $\lim_{x\to0}{\frac{x^2\cdot\sin\frac{1}{x}}{\sin x}}$,"Find the limit: $$\lim_{x\to0}{\frac{x^2\cdot\sin\frac{1}{x}}{\sin x}}$$
After treating it with l'Hopital rule, we get:
$$\lim_{x\to0}{\frac{2x\cdot\sin \frac{1}{x}-\cos\frac{1}{x}}{\cos x}}$$
Now, the numerator of fraction doesn't have a limit, so I can't use l'Hopital rule again.
What to do?
I can split it into two fractions, but I'm not sure how would it help:

727012,"A function continuously differentiable that is bijection from $\mathbb R$ to $ \mathbb R$, but the continuous inverse is not differentiable.","Does there exist a function $f: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ , $f$ is continuously differentiable and bijection and has a inverse function $g: \mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ , but $g$ is not differentiable everywhere? I compare it with the inverse theorem and found that the difference is that the differentiable function of $f$ doesn't have to be invertible, but I am struggling to find such a function.","['calculus', 'analysis']"
727036,How did the Symmetric group and Alternating group come to be named as such?,"The Dihedral group makes sense, ""Di"" means two, and ""hedral"" means.. shape I think (I've just realised how much of what I think words mean are guesses based on experience) like a ""polygon"" is a 2d shape, a ""polyhedron"" I've always thought is just ""any shape"" (example 3 dimensions). So ""Dihedral"" means 2 dimensions, which it is. (Octagon and cube have different ... reflection+rotation groups (I hope)) The symmetric group has nothing to do with symmetries of shapes, it instead is the group of all bijections from one set to another. I suppose this means symmetry as in ""abc->acb"" has the ""symmetric"" version ""$abc\to bac$"". Now the alternating group... I have no idea. Now I discovered these in ""Algebra"" and ""Abstract Algebra"" but I've peeked at the contents page of the Combinatorics book I am reading and the symmetric is discussed there, this makes a lot of sense really, combinatorics seems to be the study of finite functions and seems to be easier than functions on the reals and stuff (which felt odd as I was sketching $x^3$ before I was considering ""discreet"" functions, but if anything they're easier) So I guess that they were named because Combinatorics got there first. How? What (general case) question was being faced that lead to the solution being called ""The symmetric group"" (or even set, I doubt combinatorics would care that it is a group). Sometimes how and why are similar, like turning points, ""how did we decide to call $\frac{dy}{dx}=0$ a turning point"" and ""why"" are identical. However there may be many ""whys"" with these groups as they apply in many areas, there can be only one how. Where the term first cropped up would be a good starting point, but I've yet to find anything. I'll answer this myself if my searching yields anything.","['math-history', 'group-theory', 'symmetric-groups', 'terminology', 'combinatorics']"
727050,"Is the determinant the ""only"" group homomorphism from $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb R)$ to $\mathbb R^\times$?","This might be a dumb question; I know only enough group theory to be able to ask dumb questions. Ken W. Smith has pointed out that one way to get intuition about the determinant is to observe that it maps matrix multiplication to real multiplication. As it is continuous, too, this means that it is a Lie group homomorphism from $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb R)$ to the multiplicative group of the nonzero reals, $\mathbb R^\times$. The natural question to ask, then, is whether it is the only such homomorphism. Obviously not: any function $\mathbf A \mapsto (\det\mathbf A)^k$ for $k\in\mathbb Z$ is also a homomorphism. But are all homomorphisms between the two groups of such a form? That is, Is every Lie group homomorphism from $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb R)$ to $\mathbb R^\times$ identical to $\mathbf A \mapsto f(\det\mathbf A)$ for some homomorphism $f:\mathbb R^\times\to\mathbb R^\times$?","['lie-groups', 'linear-algebra', 'group-theory']"
