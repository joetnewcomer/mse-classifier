1794795,Arithmetic-geometric mean of 3 numbers,"The arithmetic-geometric mean $^{[1]}$ $\!^{[2]}$ of 2 numbers $a$ and $b$ is denoted $\operatorname{AGM}(a,b)$ and defined as follows: 
$$\text{Let}\quad a_0=a,\quad b_0=b,\quad a_{n+1}=\frac{a_n+b_n}2,\quad b_{n+1}=\sqrt{a_n b_n}.$$
$$\text{Then}\quad\operatorname{AGM}(a,b)=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n.$$
The arithmetic-geometric mean can be expressed in a closed form using the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and elementary functions. Let us try to generalize the arithmetic-geometric mean to 3 numbers $a,b$ and $c$. One way to define it would be just as $\operatorname{AGM}\left(\frac{a+b+c}3,\sqrt[3]{abc}\right)$. Apparently, this gives us nothing really new or interesting. Let us consider a different approach:
$$\text{Let}\quad a_0=a,\quad b_0=b,\quad c_0=c,$$
$$\quad a_{n+1}=\operatorname{AGM}(b_n,c_n),\quad b_{n+1}=\operatorname{AGM}(a_n,c_n),\quad c_{n+1}=\operatorname{AGM}(a_n,b_n).$$
$$\text{Then}\quad\operatorname{AGM}(a,b,c)=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}c_n.$$
This gives us a function different than one in the previous approach. For example, we can calculate that
$$\operatorname{AGM}(1,2,3)\approx1.909157449373156462538798818255615478726285889167...$$ (you can see more digits here ) Have this function and its properties been already studied? What is known about it? Is it possible to express $\operatorname{AGM}(a,b,c)$ (or, at least, some of its non-trivial special values) in a closed form using known special functions?","['reference-request', 'calculus', 'closed-form', 'elliptic-integrals', 'sequences-and-series']"

1794875,What is the difference between an adapted process and a predictable process?,"As the footnote on page 1 of this document mentions, even most experts in the field of stochastic processes don't seem to know rigorously what the difference is. However, since I don't have any idea of what the difference between the two is, I can't remember a definition, right or wrong for either of them. Would it be possible to give the difference in terms of ""simple"" adapted and predictable processes (i.e. the composition of a discrete-time process with an a.s. increasing sequence of stopping times) as is done here for predictable processes only ? (i.e. what about simple adapted processes?) Moreover, I know that an adapted process is a well-defined concept for discrete time; is the same true for a predictable process? If so, what is the difference between their definitions in discrete time? I would be happy to understand even just this, because then I could take the intuition behind the Ito Isometry to just be ""it's true for discrete time, now take the limit in probability and somehow it works magically in continuous time"". Seemingly related: Proof that the predictable sigma algebra is also generated by continuous and adapted processes Is a predictable process adapted?

Here's what I did: We know that $P(A\cap B) = \frac{1}{6}$ and $[1 - P(A)] \cdot [1 - P(B)] = \frac{2}{3}$ So, $$[1 - P(A)] \cdot [1 - P(B)] = \frac{2}{3} $$
$$1 - P(A) - P(B) + P(A) \cdot P(B) = \frac{2}{3}$$

Our TA provided us with a solution, but I don't understand what is going on: So it looks like they are trying to find an estimator $\delta(X)$ so that $E[\delta(X)] = g(\theta)$ ($g(\theta)$ is what we're trying to estimate). So I see they start with writing that out but I'm not sure why they are using $\gamma$ (for $n\lambda$ instead of $\lambda$). Then I'm wondering how they got the equality: $$\sum_{t=0}^\infty \frac{\gamma^t}{t!}\delta(t) = \sum_{t=0}^\infty \frac{\gamma^t}{t!}\gamma^k?$$ It's like they just got rid of the $e^{-\gamma}$. So my two questions are: 1) Why are they using $\gamma = n\lambda$ instead of just $\lambda$? 2) Where did the equality above come from?

1794931,$\bar{z}$ cannot be uniformly approximated by polynomials in $z$ on the closed unit disc in $\mathbb{C}$.,"In reference to this question, I tried to prove that $\bar{z}$ cannot be uniformly approximated by complex polynomials in $z$ on the closed unit disc $D$. I came up with a proof, but I'm not entirely sure whether it's correct. Here's how the proof goes: Assume it can be done. Pick an $\varepsilon < 0.1$ and then you'll have a polynomial $p$ such that $|p(z) - \bar{z}| < \varepsilon$ for all $z \in D$. Multiply both sides by $z$ to get:
$$|zp(z) - z\bar{z}| < |z|\varepsilon$$
Now if we just look at the points where $|z| = 1$, the inequation becomes:
$$|zp(z) - 1| < \varepsilon$$ Now I'll show on some point on the unit circle $C$, $zp(z)$ has a non-positive real part, which will lead to a contradiction because then $|zp(z) - 1| > 1 > \varepsilon$. Notice that $zp(z)$ is of the form:
$$zp(z) = a_nz^n + \cdots + a_1z$$
Pick $2(n!)$ points on the circle such that the angle between two adjacent points is $\frac{\pi}{n!}$. The sum of $zp(z)$ over these points will be $0$. Here's why: For each point, there exists a point $\pi$ radians away, so the $z$ term in $zp(z)$ goes to $0$. Similarly, the $z^2$, $z^3$ and so on terms also add up to $0$ hence the polynomial adds up to $0$. Which means at one of those points, the real part of $zp(z) \leq 0$. This leads to the contradiction mentioned above and completes the proof. Is this proof correct? And if it is correct, this only works for sets containing a neighbourhood of $0$. But you'd expect a proof a global property (i.e. uniform approximation) to not depend on any local properties (i.e. a neighbourhood of $0$). It'd be nice if someone could explain how to extend this proof to any compact set in $\mathbb{C}$.","['complex-analysis', 'weierstrass-approximation']"

1795006,Exterior derivative on principal bundle,"In Nakahara's Geometry, Topology and Physics on page 375, he constructs a Lie-algebra-valued one-form $\omega$ on a principal bundle $P$ by ""lifting"" a Lie-algebra-valued one-form $\mathcal A_i$ on an open covering $\{U_i\}$ on the base manifold $M$. Given a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued one-form $\mathcal{A}_i$ on $U_i$ and a local section $\sigma_i:U_i\to\pi^{-1}(U_i)$, he defines the connection one-form $\omega$ like this: $$
\omega_i := g_i^{-1}\pi^*\mathcal A_i g_i + g_i^{-1}\mathrm{d}_Pg_i
$$ Here, $\mathrm{d}_P$ denotes the exterior derivative on $P$ and $g_i$ is the canonical local trivialization such that $\phi_i^{-1}(u)=(p,g_i)$ and $u=\sigma_i(p)g_i$. Later he proves that $\sigma_i^*\omega_i=\mathcal A_i$, where he uses the fact that $\mathrm{d}_Pg_i({\sigma_i}_*X)=0$ because of $g\equiv e$ along ${\sigma_i}_*X$. I don't understand the notation used here. I know that $G$ acts from the right on $u\in P$. I think that's the operation meant in $\sigma_i(p)g_i$. There's the adjoint action of the group $G$ on its Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$. I think that's what's meant with $g_i^{-1}\pi^*\mathcal A_i g_i + g_i^{-1}\mathrm{d}_Pg_i$, because $\omega_i$'s values should be in $\mathfrak g$. But what is $\mathrm{d}_Pg_i({\sigma_i}_*X)$ and why does it vanish? How does $g_i$ act on the exterior derivative on $P$? And how does $\mathrm{d}_P$ produce a one-form? I thought $\mathrm{d}_P$ maps $p$-forms onto $(p+1)$-forms, so it needs a 0-form (function) as input to produce a one-form.

1795030,The Rotation Group of a Cube,"Show that the group of rotations of a cube is isomorphic to $S_4.$ This proof is from Gallian's Abstact Algebra Theorem $7.3$ Proof:Using the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem we know that the group of rotations of a cube has the same order as $S_4$ (24 elements), we need only prove that the group of rotations is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_4$. To this end, observe that a cube has four diagonals and the rotation group induces a group of permutations on the four diagonals. But we must be careful not to assume that different rotations correspond to different permutations. To see that this is so, all we need do is show that all $24$ permutations of the diagonals arise from rotations. Labeling the consecutive diagonals $1,2,3,$ and $4$, it is obvious that there is $90^\circ$ rotation that gives the permutation $\alpha = (1234)$; another $90^\circ$ rotation perpendicular to our first one gives the permutations $\beta=(1423)$. See Figure.So the group of permutations induced by the rotations contains the eight-element subgroup $\{\epsilon,\alpha,\alpha^2,\alpha^3,\beta^2,\beta^2\alpha,\beta^2\alpha^2,\beta^2\alpha^3\}$ and $\alpha\beta$, which has order $3$. Clearly, then, the rotations yield all the $24$ permutations. My Doubt :I don't understand how $\beta =(1432)$?$\,\,$ I understand how $\alpha=(1234)$ beacuse in this case you rotate the cube shown by the circular turn and $1$ takes the place of $2$, $2$ takes the place of $3$ and $3$ takes the place of $4$. But this is not so in the case of $\beta$. If you rotate as per the figure then $1$ should go to $3$ right?","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

1795049,How to prove Poisson Distribution is the approximation of Binomial Distribution?,"I was reading Introduction to Probability Models 11th Edition and saw this proof of why Poisson Distribution is the approximation of Binomial Distribution when n is large and p is small: An important property of the Poisson random variable is that it may be used to approximate a binomial random variable when the binomial parameter $n$ is large and $p$ is small. To see this, suppose that $X$ is a binomial random variable with parameters $(n, p),$ and let $\lambda=n p .$ Then $$
\begin{aligned}
P\{X=i\} &=\frac{n !}{(n-i) ! i !} p^{i}(1-p)^{n-i} \\
&=\frac{n !}{(n-i) ! i !}\left(\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^{i}\left(1-\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^{n-i} \\
&=\frac{n(n-1) \cdots(n-i+1)}{n^{i}} \frac{\lambda^{i}}{i !} \frac{(1-\lambda / n)^{n}}{(1-\lambda / n)^{i}}
\end{aligned}
$$ Now, for $n$ large and $p$ small $$
\left(1-\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^{n} \approx e^{-\lambda}, \quad \frac{n(n-1) \cdots(n-i+1)}{n^{i}} \approx 1, \quad\left(1-\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^{i} \approx 1
$$ Hence, for $n$ large and $p$ small, $$
P\{X=i\} \approx e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^{i}}{i !}

1795112,Would an integral defined using partitions of an interval into infinitely many intervals make sense?,"In the definition of Riemann integral or Darboux-integral we first study partitions (or tagged partition) of the given interval determined by finitely many points. To each partition and a function $f$ we assign a number, which serves as an ""approximation"" of the integral. And the integral is then defined as some kind of limit of these approximations. Would it be possible to define something similar with partitions consisting of infinitely many points instead of just finitely many? If there is some reasonable definition, would it bring something new, or do we just get another - and more complicated - definition of the same thing? Was something along these lines studied? To make a bit clearer what I have in mind, let me add a few comments and some examples. We want to have partition with infinitely many points. One thing we need is to know how to sum infinitely many values induced by the partition. But another thing is that the order of the points in the partition seems also to be important. (In the usual definition, we take finitely many points in the interval, but their ordering is also important. The Darboux sums and Riemann sums are defined by adding terms of the form $f(x)(a_{i+1}-a_i)$, so it is important to know which point is an immediate successor of $a_i$. This is clear for finitely many points, but less clear if we have an infinite set.) Perhaps the simplest generalization would be to take a partition of the interval $[x,y]$ determined by an increasing sequence $(a_n)$ such that $a_0=x$ and $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} a_n=y$. Then we could use infinite sums of the form $$\sum_{i=1}^\infty f(x_i)(a_{i+1}-a_i),$$ where $x_i$ belongs to the interval $[a_i,a_{i+1}]$. (My guess would be that this should give the usual Riemann/Darboux integral, at least for bounded functions. However, this definition is ""not nice"", since it treats the right endpoint of the interval differently from the left one. From a reasonable definition we would expect to be symmetric.) We could do something like that for any ordinal $\alpha$. So the partition would be an increasing transfinite sequence $(a_\gamma)_{\gamma<\alpha}$. We probably also want $\lim\limits_{\beta<\gamma} a_\beta=a_\gamma$ for any limit ordinal $\gamma$. Sums of sequences defined by ordinals can be reasonably defined, see Wikipedia . So we could use something like $$\sum_{\gamma<\alpha} f(x_\gamma)(a_{\gamma+1}-a_\gamma).$$ The preceding example would correspond to $\alpha=\omega$. There are also sums over arbitrary index sets . Such sums were discussed here or in some other posts linked there . But since here we simply take limit of sums of finite subsets, I think that this yields the same notion of integral, only described in a more convoluted way. Of course, there may be many other approaches I did not think of. I have tried to search whether similar question was asked in the past. The closest I was able to find was this: Lebesgue integration and countable partitions .
This question mentions an approach to Lebesgue integral using countable partitions. Lebesgue integral is defined in this way in the book A Primer of Lebesgue Integration by Herbert Stanley Bear, see page 62 . However, it is slightly different from what I described above. They use partition into countably many measurable sets , not countably many intervals. (But still, this relates to my questions, since it shows that somewhat similar approach can lead to Lebesgue integral .)","['real-analysis', 'integration', 'partitions-for-integration', 'riemann-sum']"

We have (admitted) $$ \langle (x_{vv}^T)_u (u,v) - (x_{vu}^T)_v (u,v) , x_u(u,v) \rangle = K \circ x(u,v)  (EG-F^2)(u,v) $$ where $x_{vv}^T$ is the tangential component of $x_{vv}$. $K$ denotes the Gaus curvature and $x_u$ is the partial derivative in $u$. Let $f$ be a local isometry bewteen $S$ and $S'$ two surfaces. Prove that $K' \circ f = K$ where $K'$ is the Gauss curvature of $S'$. I first proved that, if $x$ is a local parametrization of $S$ and $x'$ a local parametrization of $S'$ defined by $x'=f \circ x$ then : $$\begin{align*}
df_{x(u,v)} ([x_{uu}]^T (u,v)) &= [x'_{uu}]^T (u,v), \\
 df_{x(u,v)} ([x_{vv}]^T (u,v)) &= [x'_{vv}]^T (u,v)\\
df_{x(u,v)} ([x_{uv}]^T (u,v)) &= [x'_{uv}]^T (u,v)

Let $X_i$ be the $2$-dimensional subspace of $\Bbb{Z}_p^3$ containing $x\in\Bbb{Z}_p^3$ such that $w_i^\top x=0$. The line $L_i$ is formed by the points $P_j$ such that $P_j\subseteq X_i$.

Then one can obtain $(n+1)!$ singular simplices from this by permuting the standard basis via linear maps and composing with $\sigma$ . My intuition is that two such singular simplices will only differ up to some boundary of a singular $(n+1)$ -chain (additively) and up to the sign of the permutation (multiplicatively), since homology should only depend on the orientation of a simplex. More precisely, if $s$ is a permutation as described above and $\sigma_s$ is the simplex thus obtained, I expected $$\sigma = (-1)^s \sigma_s +\partial c$$ for some $n+1$ -chain $c$ , with the image of $c$ contained in the image of $\sigma$ .

Consider the $n$ -simplex $\sigma$ in $\mathbb R^n$ given as the convex hull of the standard basis and the vector $(-1, \dots, -1)$ , interpreted as a singular simplex.

1795956,Is continuity at a point only defined for points in the domain?,"I'm using Michael Spivak's Calculus , 3rd edition textbook. Without ado, I'll state the definition given for continuity at a point: DEFINITION $\;\;\;\;$The function $f$ is continuous at $a$ if: $$\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)$$ And I might as well give the definition for the limit at a point: DEFINITION $\;\;\;\;$The function $f$ approaches the limit $l$ near $a$ means: for every $\epsilon>0$ there is some $\delta>0$ such that, for all $x$, if $0<|x-a|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-l|<\epsilon$. It is clear, then, that in order to verify whether a function is continuous at a point $a$, we need to compute $f(a)$, and this is only possible if $a$ is in the domain of $f$. So, what happens when a point $a$ is not in the domain of $f$? On this matter, I've had some people telling me that statements about continuity only make for points in the domain of $f$. Spivak himself also mentions in the Continuity chapter of his textbook that ""We also often simply say that a function is continuous if it is continuous at $x$ for all $x$ in its domain."" But that means functions like $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2-1}$ and $f(x) = \sin{\frac{1}{x}}$ can all be said to be continuous. It just doesn't seem right, in fact I always thought these were textbook examples of discontinuous functions. It also means that we can't say that $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is discontinuous at $0$, because we don't even know the value of $f(0)$ in order to decide whether it's continuous or not. Are all of these conclusions correct, or did I misinterpret the definitions?

$$F(z)=\left(\phi^z - \cos(\pi z)\,\phi^{-z}\right)/\sqrt5,\quad\text{where}\,\phi=\left(1+\sqrt5\right)/2.\tag1$$
This definition is used, for example, in Mathematica . $^{[4]}$ It produces real values for $z\in\mathbb R$, and preserves the usual functional equation for Fibonacci numbers for all $z\in\mathbb C$: $$F(z)=F(z-1) + F(z-2).\tag2$$ The fibonorial $^{[5]}$ $\!^{[6]}$ $\!^{[7]}$ is usually denoted as $n!_F$, but here we prefer a different notation $\mathfrak F(n)$. It is defined for non-negative integer $n$ inductively as
$$\mathfrak F(0)=1,\quad \mathfrak F(n+1)=\mathfrak F(n)\times F(n+1).\tag3$$
In other words, the fibonorial $\mathfrak F(n)$ gives the product of the Fibonacci numbers from $F(1)$ to $F(n)$, inclusive. For example, $$\mathfrak F(5)=\prod_{m=1}^5F(m)=1\times1\times2\times3\times5=30.\tag4$$ Questions: Can the fibonorial be generalized in a natural way to an analytic function $\mathfrak F(z)$ of a complex (or, at least, positive real) variable, such that it preserves the functional equation $(3)$ for all arguments? Is there an integral, series or continued fraction representation of $\mathfrak F(z)$, or a representation in a closed form using known special functions? Is there an efficient algorithm to calculate values of $\mathfrak F(z)$ at non-integer arguments to an arbitrary precision? So, we can see that the fibonorial is to the Fibonacci numbers as the factorial is to natural numbers, and the analytic function $\mathfrak F(z)$ that I'm looking for is to the fibonorial as the analytic function $\Gamma(z+1)$ is to the factorial. Update: While thinking on this question it occurred to me that perhaps we can use the same trick that is used to define the $\Gamma$-function using a limit involving factorials of integers:
$$\large\mathfrak F(z)=\phi^{\frac{z\,(z+1)}2}\cdot\lim_{n\to\infty}\left[F(n)^z\cdot\prod_{k=1}^n\frac{F(k)}{F(z+k)}\right]\tag5$$
or, equivalently,
$$\large\mathfrak F(z)=\frac{\phi^{\frac{z\,(z+1)}2}}{F(z+1)}\cdot\prod_{k=1}^\infty\frac{F(k+1)^{z+1}}{F(k)^z\,F(z+k+1)}\tag{$5'$}$$

1796633,Formalizing continuously indexed spaces in fiber bundles?,"This MSE question asks for clarification of the local triviality condition imposed in the definition of a fiber bundle. As mentioned there, the point of local triviality seems to somehow ensure a ""continuous variation of fibers"". I would like to understand how this can be formalized (as suggested in the comments there). Let $\pi:E\longrightarrow B$ denote our fiber bundle. The extension space $E$ is partitioned into homeomorphic copies of $F$ by its fibers: $$\left\{ \left\{b\right\}\times F \mid b\in B \right\}$$ We want this collection of sets to be continuously indexed by $B$. In section 2 of his Notes on Compactness , Martín Escardó makes the following definition: Definition. Let $E$ be a topological space and $\left\{ V_b\mid b\in B \right\}$ be a family of subsets of $E$. This family will be called continuously indexed if the graph $\left\{ (x,b)\in E\times B\mid x\in V_b \right\}$ is open in the product topology in $E\times B$. At any rate, this seems like exactly the kind of continuity condition we want from the partition corresponding to a fiber bundle, so I was hoping for something along the lines of Partition by fibers is continuously indexed $(\implies,\iff,\impliedby$ bundle is locally trivial And/or anything along those lines. Finally, it would be nice if someone could explain where sheaves are related here, since they are supposed to represent continuously variable sets...","['intuition', 'fiber-bundles', 'continuity', 'general-topology', 'definition']"

Now, take $M=\mathbb{R}$ and $I$ the ideal of functions with compact support. $I \nsubseteq \mathfrak{m}_p$ for any $p \in \mathbb{R}$, but there must exist a maximal ideal $I' \subseteq C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ containing $I$.

1796863,Why Are Semimartingales the Largest Possible Class of Stochastic Integrators?,"I am trying to understand why semimartingales are the most general possible class of stochastic integrators. (I was hoping that this question would give me my answer, but it didn't.) I thought at first it was because they were the most general class of processes with defined quadratic variation. (Because I thought local martingales are supposed to be the most general class for which the quadratic variation was non-zero and could not be decomposed into the sum of non-trivial processes, one with zero quadratic variation, and because adapted processes of locally bounded variation have zero quadratic variation.) However, it turns out that this is not the content of the Bichteler-Dellacherie theorem (as I had expected). Furthermore, there are apparently counter-examples involving fractional Brownian motion (which I do not understand at all) Quadratic variation - Semimartingale The definition of the stochastic integral, when moving from Brownian motion for which the differential is just $dt$ because the quadratic variation is $t$, to arbitrary local martingales, and then semimartingales, clearly has something to do with quadratic variation, but I feel like I must be missing some part of the story if semimartingales are not the most general processes for which quadratic variation exists, is defined, and can be non-zero. EDIT: I guess it probably has something to do with p.52 of Protter, Stochastic Integration and Differential Equations , namely where a semimartingale $X_t$ is defined as any adapted process such that it is cadlag and for which the integral of the simple predictable process $H_t$ $$I_X(H)= H_0X_0 + \Sigma_{i=1}^n H_i [X_{T_{i+1}}-X_{T_i}]$$ is continuous. However, what I don't understand: 1. Why cadlag? I assume because it guarantees only jump discontinuities, and with that at most countably many discontinuities (like for a distribution function? or is that only because a distribution function is increasing -- if we don't have that the sample paths are of locally bounded variation anymore, does it still hold that we can only have countably many jump discontinuities?) 2. Why do we care if that integral is continuous? I know it forms the basis for the Ito integral, but what's wrong with having it be a discontinuous process? (If for example we can generalize from continuous semimartingales to arbitrary semimartingales which must be cadlag, why can't we consider cadlag integrals?)","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'stochastic-integrals', 'stochastic-analysis', 'stochastic-calculus']"
