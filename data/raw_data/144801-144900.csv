2362001,Using Fourier series to determine if a function is odd or even,"Determine if the following function is odd or even using Fourier series. $$f(x)=x^5\sin x$$ If a function is even then $b_n=0$ and you have to evaluate $a_n=\frac 2 \pi \int_0^\pi f(x) \cos nx \, dx$ And if a function is odd then $a_n=0$ and you have to evaluate $b_n=\frac 2 \pi \int_0^\pi f(x)\sin nx \, dx$ However, this means that I have to do integration by parts five times. Is there a more efficient method to determine if the function is even or odd?","['algebra-precalculus', 'fourier-series', 'calculus']"
2362004,How to prove this statement about polynomials?,"Consider the following statement: Let $F$ be an infinite field and $g$ be a given non-zero polynomial in $F[x_1,\ldots,x_r]$. If $f(x_1,\ldots,x_r)\in F[x_1,\ldots,x_r]$ and $f(a_1,\ldots,a_r) = 0$ for all $a_i$ such that $g(a_1,\ldots,a_r) \neq 0$, then $f$ is the zero polynomial. I can see e.g. why this is true for $F = \mathbb R$, but the way I see it is extremely unhelpful - I see it through measure-theoretic means. I would like to prove this for any field and through purely algebraic means. Any hints on how to do this?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'polynomials', 'field-theory']"
2362054,Compute $\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(1+x^2)^{n+1}}dx$ via residue calculus.,"Let $\Gamma_R$ be the semicircle of radius $R$ in the upper half plane. Then, 
\begin{align}
\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(1+x^2)^{n+1}}dx 
&= \lim_{R\to \infty}\int_{\Gamma_R}\frac{1}{(1+z^2)^{n+1}}dz \\
&= 2\pi i \operatorname{Res}\left(\frac{1}{(1+z^2)^{n+1}},i\right)
\end{align}
The pole of the function at $i$ is of order $n+1$, so the residue is computed by
\begin{align}
\operatorname{Res}\left(\frac{1}{(1+z^2)^{n+1}},i\right) &= \frac{1}{n!}\lim_{z\to i}\frac{d^n}{dz^n}\left(\frac{1}{(z+i)^{n+1}}\right) \\
&= \frac{1}{n!}\lim_{z\to i}(-1)^n\frac{(n+1)(n+2)\cdots(2n+1)}{(z+i)^{2n+1}} \\
&=\frac{(2n+1)!}{i2^{2n+1}(n!)^2}

2362068,The limit of the product of two convergent sequences,"Let $\{x_n\}$ and $\{y_n\}$ be convergent sequences. Prove that the sequence $\{z_n\},$ where $z_n=x_n y_n,$ converges and $\lim_{n\to\infty} (x_n y_n) =\lim_{n\to\infty} z_n = (\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n)(\lim_{n\to\infty} y_n).$ (Partial  proof) Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. As ${x_{n}}$ is convergent, it is bounded. Therefore, we find a $B>0$ s.t. $|x_{n}|\le B $ for all $n\in N$. Next We find $M_{1}$ s.t. for all $n\ge M_{1} $ we have   $$|x_{n}-x|\le \frac{\varepsilon}{2(|y|+1)} $$ We find $M_{2}$ s.t. for all $n\ge M_{2} $ we have   $$|y_{n}-y|\le \frac{\varepsilon}{2B}. $$ I didn't write the whole proof.

2362083,Rank of a Submatrix,"Let 
  $$B=\left[\begin{array}{c |cc}
  1 & \begin{array}{ccc}0 & \cdots & 0\end{array} \\
\hline
  \begin{array}{c}0\\ \vdots\\0\end{array} & B' \\
\end{array}\right],$$
  where $B'$ is an $m \times n$ submatrix of $B$. Prove that if $rank(B)=r$, then $rank(B')=r-1$. Here is an attempt at a proof. As you will notice, I am not sure how to finish it, so hopefully someone might help me with finishing it. First note that $f : F^n \to F^{n+1}$ defined by $$f(v) = f(\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \\ \end{bmatrix}) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \\ \end{bmatrix}$$ is a injective linear operator and therefore maps linearly independent sets to linearly independent sets. For simplicity, we may write $f(v) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ v \\ \end{bmatrix}$ Let $B = [e_1 ~|~ b_1 ~|~ b_2 ~|~ \dots ~|~ b_n]$, where $e_1$ is the first column of $B$, $b_2$ the second, etc; similarly, let $B' = [b_1' ~|~ b_2' ~|~ \dots ~|~ b_n']$. Then it can easily be seen that $b_i = f(b_i')$. Moreover, let $S$ denote the maximal set of linearly independent columns of $B$, and let $S'$ denote the same thing of $B'$; then we have $rank(B)=|S|$ and $rank(B')=|S'|$. Since the columns of $B$ have zeros in their first entry, clearly the first column $e_1$ cannot be in the span of the remaining columns and is therefore included in $S$. Here is the part I am having trouble with. I am trying to argue that $S = \{e_1\} \cup f(S')$. The sets involved in the union are clearly disjoint, since $e_1 \notin f(F^n)$, so $|S| = 1 + |f(S')|$. Since injective maps preserve cardinality, we have $|f(S')| = |S'| = rank(B')$, and the problem follows immediately. I am being a knucklehead; I can't figure out how to finish this last step. I could use some help. EDIT: When you read this post, if you could please check that the dimensions of the matrix are consistent with the spaces over which $f$ acts, I would appreciate that, since I often mess up those details.","['matrix-rank', 'linear-algebra', 'vector-spaces']"

2362209,"Central limit theorem -- Is it about sums, averages, or both? [closed]","Closed . This question needs details or clarity . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 6 years ago . Improve this question The central limit theorem is, as far as I know, a statement about the probability distribution of the average ${\sum (X_i)_n\ /\ n}$ of $n$ iid random variables $(X_i)_n$, where $(X_i)_n:=(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ and $\sum (X_i)_n:=X_1+\cdots+X_n$. Both the average ${\sum (X_i)_n\ /\ n}$ and the sum ${\sum (X_i)_n}$ of $n$ iid random variables will converge in distribution to a normal distribution $\mathcal{N}$. More precisely, let $(X_i)_n$ be a sequence of $n$ iid random variables, let $D[\mu,\nu]$ be a probability distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\nu$, let $\sum (X_i)_n$ be the sum of all $X_i$, let $\textbf{A}(X_i)_n$ be the average of all $X_i$ (where the average of an $n$-tuple is the sum divided by $n$). The following hold (I think): If $X_i \sim D[\mu_i,\nu_i]$, then $\sum(X_i)_n \sim \mathcal{N}[\sum(\mu_i)_n, \sum(\nu_i)_n]$ If $X_i \sim D[\mu_i,\nu_i]$, then $\textbf{A}(X_i)_n \sim \mathcal{N}[\textbf{A}(\mu_i)_n, \textbf{A}(\nu_i)_n]$ where $\mathcal{N}[\mu,\nu]$ stands for a normal  distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\nu$. Assuming these results are true, then both have a ""central limit flavor"" to them. So why not refer to either of them as ""the"" central limit theorem? In any case, the central limit theorem seems to be a result about linear operators ($\sum$ and $\textbf{A}$, in this case) acting on vectors of random variables. Why is the central limit theorem not usually seen as a result about sums? Sums and averages seem like almost the same to me, but sums are simpler. More importantly, is there a general theory that studies (linear, or otherwise) operators acting on vectors of random variables?","['probability-theory', 'central-limit-theorem', 'probability-distributions']"
2362218,Solving an ordinary differential equation with Laplace Transform,"I am trying to solve the following ordinary differential equation, where $y$ is a function of $t$: $$ty''+(2+4t)y'+(4+4t)y=0.$$ My attempt was to use the Laplace Transform. The following formulae were assumed, where $\mathcal{L}(y)$ is the Laplace transform of a function $y$ defined by
$$\mathcal{L}(y(t))=\int_0^{\infty}e^{-st}y(t)dt=Y(s):$$ $\mathcal{L}(ty'')=-s^2Y'(s)-2sY(s)+y(0)$; $\mathcal{L}(ty')=-sY'(s)-Y(s)$; $\mathcal{L}(ty)=-Y'(s)$; $\mathcal{L}(y')=sY(s)-y(0)$. After applying $\mathcal{L}$ to both sides of $ty''+(2+4t)y'+(4+4t)y=0$ and simplifying, I obtain 
$$Y(s)=\frac{y(0)}{s+2}+C$$
and here $C=0$ because $\displaystyle\lim_{s\to\infty}Y(s)=0$. Then applying the inverse Laplace Transform to $Y(s)=\dfrac{y(0)}{s+2},$
we obtain the solution 
$$y(t)=y(0)e^{-2t}.$$ But the general solution to the original differential equation should be
$$y(t)=y(0)e^{-2t}+C_1e^{-2t}t^{-1}.$$ My Question : Why is the term $C_1e^{-2t}t^{-1}$ missing in my solution? Somehow I failed to find any mistake in my process, but the general solution is incomplete (although applying variation of parameters may make it complete, but my question is about the Laplace Transform method).","['laplace-transform', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'proof-verification']"

Use the curl theorem to find $\displaystyle\int_\mathcal{C}F\cdot ds$ . My approach: I know, by the curl thm. that $\displaystyle\int_{\partial S}F\cdot dr =\int_{ S}\operatorname{curl}(F)\cdot d\Sigma$ I calculated the curl for $F$ and the result was $\operatorname{curl}(F)(x,y,z)=(-2z,-3x^2,-1)$ .

2362584,Linearly independent subset of polynomials,"Let $S$ be a set of non-zero polynomials over a field $F$.

Besides, is there other method to prove the statement? Thanks! Let n be the number of elements in a finite subset of S. Base case $n = 1$ $\alpha f = 0 \implies \alpha = 0$ because $f \ne 0$. Assume the statement is true for $n=k$. When $n = k+1$,
suppose $$\sigma= \alpha_1 f_1+....+\alpha_k f_k+ \alpha_{k+1} f_{k+1}=0$$
WLOG, we may assume that $f_{k+1}$ has the highest degree among all $f_i${i=1,2,...,k+1}. Let $m= \deg f_{k+1}$ Denote the leading coefficient of $f_{k+1}$ by $\lambda$. The coefficient of $x^{m}$ will be zero for all other $f_i$. Note that the coefficient of $x^{m}$ in $\sigma$ will then be $$\alpha_{k+1}\lambda=0$$
By the definition of leading coefficient, $$\lambda  \ne 0$$. So $$\alpha_{k+1}=0$$
This implies $$\alpha_1 f_1+....+\alpha_k f_k=0$$
By induction assumption, $$\alpha_1 = \alpha_2=...=\alpha_{k}=0$$
Hence, $f_1,f_2,....,f_{k+1}$ are linearly independent.

2362636,$n$ points are picked uniformly and independently on the unit circle. What is the probability the convex hull does not contain the origin? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Centre in N-sided polygon on circle [closed] (2 answers) Closed 6 years ago . We place $n$ points on the unit circle uniformly and independently . What is the probability that their convex hull does not contain the origin? I came up with this: If the convex hull does not contain the origin then there is one point $x$ such that the next point $y$ in clockwise order forms an angle $xOy$ larger than $\pi$. Therefore we just need to calculate the probaility that this happens at least once, but notice that this cannot happen more than once . Suppose that $x_1,x_2,\dots x_n$ are the points that are to be placed independently, then the probability that the next point after $x_i$ forms an angle larger than $\pi$ is $\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$. Therefore the probability the hull does not contain the origin is $\frac{n}{2^{n-1}}$ I would greatly appreciate a proof verification, alternative proofs and insight as to whether this can be generalized to higher dimensions, when there are $d+2$ points it is possible, as is shown here .","['convex-geometry', 'probability', 'convex-hulls', 'geometry']"

2362811,Derivative and partial derivative of complex functions,"I know the formal definition of a derivative of a complex valued function, and how to compute it (same as how I would for real-valued functions), but after doing some problems, I feel as if I could just take the partial derivative w.r.t $x$ of the function to compute the derivative (so it doesn't depend on $y$ ?) as opposed to taking derivative w.r.t $z$ first then substitute.
That might be a bit obscure, so I'll put in a couple of examples Examples All of the examples are analytic (satisfy the Riemann conditions) with $z = x+iy$ and $f(z) = u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$ . $f(z) = z = x+iy =u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ . The derivative is $f'(z) = 1$ . Another way would be just to take partials of $f(z)$ w.r.t $x$ to get the result. $f(z) = z^2 = (x+iy)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy$ $f'(z) = 2z = 2x + 2iy$ Another way is to just directly take partial derivative of $f$ w.r.t $x$ since $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 2y$ . $f(z) = z^3 = (x+iy)^3 = x^3 - 3xy^2 + i(3x^2 y - y^3)$ . $ f'(z) = 3z^2 = 3x^2 -3y^2 + 6ixy$ . This can also be found similarly in other examples since $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3 y^2$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 6xy$ . So it seems that I could just take the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ of the resultant complex number, and ignore the $y$ to find the derivatives.

2362845,Is the complement of an injective continuous map $\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2$ with closed image necessarily disconnected?,"I am interested in the following Jordan curve theorem-esque question: Suppose that you are given a continuous, injective map $\gamma:
 \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2$ such that the image is a closed subset of
  $\mathbb{R}^2$.  The complement of the image is an open subset of
  $\mathbb{R}^2$ and therefore consists of some number of path connected
  components.  Must this number always be greater than 1? There are several cases in which this question reduces to the Jordan curve theorem, and one in which it does not (this last case is where the subtlety seems to lie): Case 1: If the limits $\lim_{t\to \pm \infty} |\gamma(t)| = \infty$ then we can extend $\gamma$ continuously to a continuous, injective map $S^1\to S^2$ via stereographic coordinates. The result then follows by the Jordan curve theorem. Case 2: If either of the limits $\lim_{t\to \pm \infty} \gamma(t)$ exist, then since the image of $\gamma$ is closed, the limit must equal $\gamma(t_0)$ for some $t_0 \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $\gamma$ induces a continuous, injective mapping $S^1 \to \mathbb{R}^2$, and the result follows by the Jordan curve theorem. Case 3: If neither of the limits $\lim_{t\to \pm \infty} \gamma(t)$ exist, and $\lim_{t\to  \infty} |\gamma(t)| \neq \infty$ or $\lim_{t\to - \infty} |\gamma(t)| \neq \infty$, then it's unclear what may happen, but I can't imagine an example where the complement is connected. For example, consider a figure-8 type curve such that the ends approach the middle of the figure 8 from both sides like a topologists sine curve pictured below (this picture is edited from a picture in Munkres Topology, 2ed, p381, or the examples discussed in this answer: Is there a continuous injective map from $\mathbb{R}$ that has compact image? ).

2362924,Name for the property of “being a Cartesian product of arbitrary sets”,"Suppose I have a set $S$ of pairs (or, in general, tuples, or objects with two or more parts/attributes/projections). This set may have the property that $$(a, b) \in S  \wedge (a', b') \in S \implies (a, b') \in S$$ which can also be described as $S$ is the Cartesian product of some sets. $S$ is closed under $f$ where $f((a, b), (a', b')) = (a, b')$. Is there a more direct, and well-known or obvious, name for this property, or perhaps for $f$? Preferably one readily understood by those with a background in computer science. The application is generally that $S$ is some collection of usable objects which have at least two independent attributes, and I want to talk about whether, for the values those attributes actually take on, every combination of those attributes is available, or whether $S$ is instead incomplete (not closed, not orthogonal). More concretely, where this question arose is that I'm writing a collection of functions (in the programming-language sense) which all do “the same thing” but with different details of the input and output types, and I wanted to talk about the concept of whether or not the set of functions actually written has any obvious gaps, where my notion of “obvious” is “can be constructed by $f$” — note that $f$ is a meta-operation here, and not something the program actually deals in. So $f$ is really not associated with $S$ inherently; it's a tool for understanding, which I don't actually want to have to define in order to communicate that understanding. “is a Cartesian product” seems fairly good, but it doesn't convey the notion that it's a product of possibly arbitrary sets, as opposed to meaningful ones. That is, suppose I have $S = \{\mathrm a, \mathrm b\} \times \{1, 2, 5\}$ which is a subset of $\mathbb \{\mathrm a, \mathrm b\} \times \mathbb Z^+$ — one could easily want $(\mathrm b, 3)$ which is not a member, so I would prefer to talk specifically about $S$ being closed under $f$ , without implying that it is complete in the sense of containing everything one might want, but I don't know a good name for $f$.","['terminology', 'magma', 'elementary-set-theory']"

2363181,Understanding the Proof of L'Hopital's Rule,"The following is an excerpt from Bartle and Sherbert's Introduction to Real Analysis : Okay. I am having a little trouble following this proof. What is $c$ and why is it in $(a,b)$? What confuses me is that there is no reference to any $\delta$ nor any reference $x$ such that $0 < x - a < \delta$. They just simply write $L - \epsilon \le \frac{f(\beta)}{g(\beta)} \le L + \epsilon$ and claim that the conclusion follows. I suspect they are using $\beta$ in place of $x$, but this still doesn't account for the absence of a $\delta$ and why $\beta$ wouldn't satisfy $0 < \beta - a < \delta$. On second thought, perhaps $\beta$ and $c$ are intended to stand for the typically used $x$ and $\delta$, respectively. It seems that what the authors have shown is that for every $\epsilon> 0$, there exists a $c > 0$ such that if $\beta$ satisfies $a < \beta \le c$, then $|\frac{f(\beta)}{g(\beta)} - L| \le \epsilon$. Even on that interpretation, why is $c$ (i.e., $\delta$) in $(a,b)$? In fact, if $a$ and $b$ are negative, this doesn't make much sense... EDIT: Okay. I think I follow what you, @Jack, are saying. However, there is one last thing giving me trouble. Just before equation (2), the authors claim that there exists a specific $u \in (\alpha, \beta)$ by the Cauchy Mean Value theorem such that equation (2) holds. Now, in order to validly substitute this in the inequality below (2) to obtain inequality (3), we need that that specific $u$ is in $(a,c)$, but this has not been demonstrated. All that we have is that if $u \in (a,c)$, then $L - \epsilon < \frac{f'(u)}{g'(u)} < L + \epsilon$, but how do we know that the specific $u$, guaranteed to exist by the Cauchy Mean Value theorem, falls in the interval $(a,c)$? Also, it doesn't seem that we merely want to assume that $\beta \in (a,b)$ but that $\beta$ is arbitrary in $(a,c)$, right? Or may be it doesn't matter, since if we have ""$\beta \in (a,b) \implies |\frac{f(\beta)}{g(\beta)} - L | <\epsilon$"", then we would clearly have ""$\beta \in (a,c) \subseteq (a,b) \implies |\frac{f(\beta)}{g(\beta)} - L | < \epsilon$"".

So I considered taking instead the derivative between the two points adjacent to $x$ as represent in the function in the title above of $\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f\left(x+h\right)-f\left(x-h\right)}{2h}$. But the question that I have is a valid redefinition? Some of my thoughts: If $$\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f\left(x+h\right)-f\left(x-h\right)}{2h}=f'(x)$$ then $$\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f\left(x+h\right)-f\left(x-h\right)}{2h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f\left(x+h\right)-f\left(x\right)}{h}$$ further implying that $$f(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)+f(x-h)}{2}$$ When I input this function in WolframAlpha I get an output telling me that this is true for all analytical functions and the series expansion approaches $f(x)$.

(Stanford's ""basic"" discrete math is apparently more than the one I had) I want to make sure I get these concepts here, so my question is: Q: Is the below a reasonable working understanding of the gist of a probability distribution, event, discrete random variable, and random algorithm? Some of the notation is a bit confusing. I'm going to assume I made mistakes so any feedback is greatly appreciated. A probability distribution defines a function mapping events to a range $[0,1]$ An event is a subset of the sample space (are the objects in the set considered equivalent?) The probability of anything from an event set occurring is the sum of the probabilities of its elements (naturally) The probability of a union of events is bounded above by the sum of their probabilities (union bound / Boole's inequality, seems straightforward) A discrete random variable is a function mapping a value from $U$ to some other set $V$ (it is said to ""take values in V"" -- why ""take""?) and it defines a distribution on $V$ $Pr[X=x]$ represents the probability that event x will occur under the probability distribution defined by random variable (function) $X$ (I'm especially interested in getting this right since he seems to use this syntax a lot) A uniform random variable is a random variable whose probabilities are all $1/|U|$ (simple enough) The notation for a uniform random variable is $r \xleftarrow R U$ -- what does the $R$ represent here? A randomized algorithm has an implicit parameter $r$ (a random variable). A randomized algorithm points to a region of outputs (this matches with Shannon's ""region of uncertainty"" for signals in n-space, so that makes sense) The output of a randomized algorithm is a random variable taken from the codomain, representing a probability distribution over a subset of the codomain.

2363847,First approximation of the expected value of the positive part of a random variable,"Consider a random variable $X$ with mean zero ( $\mu_X = 0$ ), known variance ( $\sigma_X^2$ ), and all other moments finite but unknown. I am interested in obtaining an estimate of the expected value of the positive part of this random variable, i.e., given $X^{+} \equiv \max(0, X)$ I want $\mathbb{E}(X^{+})$ . Preferably this would only be a function of the variance as I have no other information, but this may not be possible. It is simple to apply a standard Taylor series approach to this problem, e.g. if $f$ is the positive part function: $$\mathbb{E}\left[f(X)\right]\approx f(\mu _{X})+{\frac  {f''(\mu _{X})}{2}}\sigma _{X}^{2}$$ However, as $\mu_X = 0$ , we need to find $f''(\mu_X)$ , which is undefined. It is easy to make a function which converges to $X^+$ in some limit and has defined $f''(\mu_X)$ , but this behavior is not unique, so I don't expect the behavior this function has to also apply to $X^+$ . It is not difficult to show that $\mathbb{E}(X^{+}) < \sigma_X$ , but I'd prefer to know something like $\mathbb{E}(X^{+}) \approx \alpha \, \sigma_X$ , where $\alpha$ is a constant to be determined. (Thanks to stud_iisc for noting that the inequality is strict.)

2363855,Which open sets $O$ satisfy $\text{Int}[O^c] \cup O = X$?,"Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space, let $O\in\tau$, let $O^c$ be the complement of $O$ in $X$, let $\text{Int}[O]$ be the interior of $O$. Which open sets $O$ satisfy $\text{Int}[O^c] \cup O = X$? My guess is that it's precisely the clopen sets. I think the following is a proof. Is it correct? Suppose $O$ is clopen. Then, in particular, $O$ is closed. So, its complement $O^c$ is open. Since the interior of an open set is again that open set, we have that $\text{Int}[O^c]$ is again $O^c$. Therefore, $\text{Int}[O^c] \cup O$ equals $O^c \cup O$, which equals $X$ by the definion of complement . This proves one direction. Now suppose $\text{Int}[O^c] \cup O = X$. Since $O^c\cup O = X$ by definition, we must have that $O^c \subseteq \text{Int}[O^c]$, because otherwise the union $\text{Int}[O^c] \cup O$ wouldn't be enough to cover all of $X$. But the interior of a set is always a subset of that set, meaning $\text{Int}[O^c]\subseteq O^c$. Now we have $\text{Int}[O^c] = O^c$. This means $O^c$ is open, and so $O$ is closed. Also, $O$ is open by hypothesis.","['general-topology', 'proof-writing', 'proof-verification']"

2364027,"Prove that $\forall x > 0, x - 1 \ge \ln(x)$","Prove that $\forall x > 0, x - 1 \ge \ln(x)$ . Here is my proof: We prove the inequality on two intervals, $(0,1]$ and $[1,+\infty)$. First the easier one, $[1,+\infty)$. Notice that at $x=1$, the inequality holds true. Notice also that $\forall x\in [1,+\infty)$, $\frac{1}{x} \le 1 \le x$. But this is the same as: $$\forall x\in [1,+\infty), \frac{d[ \ln{x}]}{dx} \le 1 \le \frac{d[x-1]}{dx}$$ But we know that if $f,g$ are two functions such that, for some $x_0$, $f(x_0) \ge g(x_0)$ and $\forall x\ge x_0, f'(x)\ge g'(x),$ then $\forall x \ge x_0 , f(x) \ge g(x). $ Therefore our inequality holds on the interval $[1,+\infty)$. Now for the second interval. Consider the functions $f(x) = -x -1$ and $g(x) = \ln(-x)$. These are essentially the reflections of our two previous functions in the y-axis. We will consider these functions only on the interval $[-1, 0)$. Notice that at $x=-1$, we have $f(x) = g(x)$. Furthermore, on our interval $\frac{1}{x} \le -1 \le x$. But this is exactly the same as: 
$$\forall x \in [-1, 0), g'(x) \le f'(x)$$ By the same theorem as before, we have: $$\forall x \in [-1, 0), \ln(-x) \le -x-1$$ Now let $y=-x$. Then $y \in (0,1]$ and the previous statement is equivalent to: 
$$\Leftrightarrow \forall y\in (0,1], \ln(y) \le y-1$$ Hence we have shown that the equality holds on $(0,+\infty].$ Is the proof complete? I am especially curious about the validity of the last step, where we let $-x = y$. Is that a valid step?
