15400,A helical cycloid?,"While combing around my notes looking for other possible examples for this question , I chanced upon another one of my unsolved problems: Cycloidal curves are curves generated by a circle rolling upon a plane or space curve. It's not too hard to derive the required parametric equations if the fixed curve is a plane curve , but I've had some trouble deriving the corresponding expression for space curves. More specifically, here is the particular problem I was concerned with: consider a (cylindrical) helix: $$\begin{align*}x&=a\cos\;t\\y&=a\sin\;t\\z&=ct\end{align*}$$ and imagine a circle of radius $r$ whose plane is always perpendicular to the x-y plane rolling on the helix, starting at the point $(a,0,0)$ ($t=0$). Imagine a point in the plane of the circle at a distance $hr$ from the center. What are the parametric equations for the locus of the point? The two obvious pieces of information I have are that the center of the circle also traces a helix, whose parametric equation differs from the original by a vertical shift of $r$ (per Tony, that was an erroneous assumption), and that the expression for the arclength of the helix, $s=\sqrt{a^2+c^2}t$, should figure into the final parametric equations. Otherwise, I'm not sure how to start. How does one derive parametric equations for the ""helical cycloid""? The physical model I had in mind was a screw ramp winding around a cylinder. Supposing that there was a car that needed to go to the top of the cylinder by driving on the ramp, and supposing that a spot is placed on one of the car's wheels, what are the equations for the locus of the spot?",['geometry']

The method suggested by the book is to define a map $k$: $\text(\mathbb{Z},G) \to G$ by $f \to f(1)$. I am stuck on how exactly to show that it is an isomorphism. Could anyone shed some light into this? Is $f(1)$ an element of G? (For those who wanted to know, this is not homework)",['group-theory']

15425,Approximating the volume of the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve,"For an abelian variety $A_{/\mathbb{Q}}$, its volume $vol(A(\mathbb{R}))$ appears in the conjectured Birch Swinnerton-Dyer formula for the L-series at 1. I am having trouble in understanding the size of this volume, as a function of the (minimal) equations defining the variety. Hence the question: Say we have a hyperelliptic curve given by $$y^2 = x^{2g+1}+a_{2g}x^{2g}+\ldots +a_0$$ for simplicity, assume that $a_i\approx M > 0$ for all $i$. What is a good crude estimate for the volume of the Jacobian? Note: for an elliptic curve this is easy, since there is only one differential and hence only one simple integral.","['algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'number-theory']"
15426,2 slightly different situations in which 2 coins are tossed. Does the knowledge of an observer effect the probabilities of the outcomes?,"Situation A: Once only, I toss 2 identical fair coins and don't look at the outcomes. A truthful observer looks at one of the coins and tells me that at least one of the coins is a head. Situation B: Once only, I toss 2 identical fair coins and don't look at the outcomes. A truthful observer looks at both of the coins and tells me that at least one of the coins is a head. In A, what is the probability that there are 2 heads? In B, what is the probability that there are 2 heads? Aren't both probabilities 1/2? EDIT Let me refine the question. The agreement I have with the observer is this:
1) I will toss 2 identical coins. 2) In situation A a third party will cover the coins with a cloth. The observer will look only at the outcome of the coin that comes to rest nearest him and report it to me. What is the probability that the second outcome will be the same as the first? 3) In situation B the observer will look at both outcomes and report only the state (heads or tails) of the coin that came to rest nearest him. What is the probability that the second outcome will be the same as the first? 2nd EDIT Changing 3) above to:
3) In situation B the observer will look at both outcomes, choose one of them, and truthfully report, ""There is at least one heads"", or ""There is at least one tails"", whichever is the case. What is the probability that the second outcome (that of the other coin) will be the same as the first?",['probability']

Do you know if it has a name ?",['geometry']
15443,What are polar co-ordinates?,"This is a very basic question that I feel that I should know the answer to but haven't been able to think through clearly. In linear algebra, we learn that the basis of a finite dimensional vector space can be thought of as 'co-ordinates' of that space. And, we model what we intuitively understand as the euclidean plane, using the vector space $\mathbb{R^2}$ equipped with the standard inner product and metric etc. The underlying space is taken to be independent of the choice of basis, that is we understand that properties that are inherent to the space are those that will be invariant under change of basis. Now, $\mathbb{R^2}$ comes with a canonical basis: this can be understood as saying that given any arbitrary two dimensional vector space and any basis, the vectors $v_i$ of the basis under the co-ordinate map maps to $e_i$. Since, we have also introduced inner products and thus a notion of parallel, the intuitive picture we now have of the co-odrinate grid is a criss-cross of lines. and the 'co-ordinates' are called, imaginatively, 'rectangular co-ordinates'. In school, we also learn about polar 'co-ordinates' of the plane. The associated picture is of concentric circles and rays fanning out of the origin.
However, these 'co-ordinates' do not fit within the 'Basic Linear Algebra' framework (since among other things, $0$ has no unique representation and the functions that change the variables are not linear). The one way of seeing the transformation of the 'rulings' of the plane is to consider $\mathbb{R^2}$ as $\mathbb{C}$ and the change as the map $\exp: \mathbb C \to \mathbb C$. What is the framework in which the notion of 'co-ordinates' subsumes both these pictures (likewise for cylindrical, spherical, etc in dimension(?) three). My second and connected question: is there a linear algebraic connection for using two numbers to represent points in polar co-ordinate, i.e. is it because the vector space dimension of $\mathbb{E^2}$ is two. My third question is: am I confusing different concepts of 'dimension' here? Added : Thanks for all the replies. They are all great but given my continuing dissatisfaction, either I have not really understood the answers or haven't been able to communicate the question properly (or perhaps and quite likely, I don't know what I want to ask). Now, when we think of a (topological) manifold, we think of some object that is locally euclidean, i.e., we already have a 'handle' on $\mathbb{E^n}$ and want to use our knowledge of being able to do things, such as calculus, onto the new object . In my question, I am looking at ways we can 'handle' $\mathbb{E^2}$ itself, so invoking manifolds, seems a bit like putting the cart before the horse. I want to say something like this: The point of polar co-ordinates is to represent the plane by looking at it as $S^1\times \mathbb{R}$, where $S^1$ is a basic object like $\mathbb R$.","['linear-algebra', 'calculus']"

15461,"Definition of functions based on ""fuzzy"" truth table","I'm stuck on this problem: I have a ""truth-table"" (well, I don't know if it can be called truth table, if there aren't true/false values only): string |  a |  b
---------------------
      x |  1 |  0
      z |  1 |  0
     xx |  1 |  1

    zxx |  2 | -1
    zxz |  2 | -1
    zzx |  0 | -1
    zzz |  0 | -1 ... the list goes on for string of any length, e.g. xxzxxzxxzzxzzxx -> a = -4, b = -1. I can calculate the a and b values from a given string, but the number of steps grows with the length of the string. I am hoping for some kind of better algorithm. Edit: Here is my original algorithm: rotation = 0 // 0 -> up, 1 -> right, 2 -> down, 3 -> left
pos_x = 0    // this is the ""b""
pos_y = 0    // this is the ""a""

function rotate (n):
    rotation += n
    rotation %= 4 // result is positive integer, e.g. -1 % 4 = 3

function forward (n):
    if n == 0: pos_y++
    if n == 1: pos_x++
    if n == 2: pos_y--
    if n == 3: pos_x--

for char in string:
    forward()
    if char == ""x"": rotate(1)  // to the right
    else:           rotate(-1) // to the left I can easily get the final rotation from a string: function final_rotation (n):
    rot = (number of occurences of ""x"") - (number of occurences of ""z"")
    rot %= 4
    return rot But the pos_x and pos_y (or a and b)? No idea :/ The Karnaugh-maps came to my mind - but I'm unsure how to deal with this, since the values of a and b aren't true/false, but integers. Also it looks like it's ternary logic, because of the three possible states of string[position] - x, z, none . As far as I understand this, the last (rightmost) letter of a string doesn't have a say in what the a and b values will be. But what does? So, my question is - how to find the algorithm for a and b ?","['functions', 'fuzzy-logic', 'algorithms']"

(The case listed as ""Zariski's main theorem""  in Hartshorne is the case of $f$ birational and $Y$ normal.) This may be proved via the formal function theorem. The fancier version of ZMT (EGA IV-8) is that a quasifinite separated morphism of finite presentation between quasicompact, quasiseparated schemes factors as the composite of an open immersion and a finite morphism.

The community reviewed whether to reopen this question last month and left it closed: Original close reason(s) were not resolved Improve this question From the first day that I entered college, I was wondering about the relationship between some basic mathematical abstract concepts and nature. I'm going to explain them here and you may find them a little bit opinion-based, but it's not. So please guide me in case you have good scientific-based answers/examples. Infinity :
Does infinity exist in reality? We all know it is an abstract concept but what I'm curious to know is if there are any physical phenomena out there that can show, stimulate or somehow help us understand the concept of infinity in reality/nature/the physical world. Zero :
What about Zeno's paradox ? In nature (our physical world) there is a "" smallest distance "". It's about $1.6 \times 10^{-35}$ meters . Another example would be when someone says ""there are three apples on the desk, if you take all of them there are $0$ apples on the desk"". Obviously, it's an abstract concept, but what I would like to know is that if there is any observable physical event that can anyhow show us the concept of nothingness or absolute zero. E.g., we don't have absolute zero temperature in thermodynamics, absolute zero distance between 2 points in mechanics, or absolute zero gravity in a given space, etc. Axiom of empty set : This axioms states: ""There is a set such that no element is a member of it."" One can imagine an empty set in nature as an absolutely empty box. But one can see it the other way around: the element ""nothing"" is there (quoting from Prof. Lawrence Krauss's book ""nothing is something""). So, the same way one can say the element ""nothing"" is a member of a set. Obviously, it's an abstract concept and this may look like a play on words, but it's also an interesting paradox. $\mathbb R$ ?!

15596,Mean of interpolated data or interpolation of means in geostatistics,"Say I have a time series, with actual measurements of a variable $a$ in different locations.  If I want to know the average of $p$ from time $t_1$ to $t_n$, I could say that $\overline{a_{p}}=\frac{\sum\limits_{t=1}^n a_{{p}_t}}{n}$, where $p$ is the coordinate of the point of measurement.  So far, so good.  Let's generalize and call this averaging function $m_p=f(a_p,t)$, where $f(a,t)$ is some deterministic function and $m$ is its result. Now, say I want to calculate $m$ for a location $o$, where $o$ is a points for which I don't have actual measurements and $a_o$ was estimated through a an interpolating function $g(a,o)$.  My intuition tells me that in this case, we should first estimate every $a_{o_t}$ before applying $f(a,t)$. In other words, considering that $a_o = g(a,o)$, we get $m_o$ by doing: $m_o=f[g(a,o),t]=f(a_o,t)$ But I have seen so many papers that do the other way around.  They first calculate $f(a,t)$ for every known $a$ and then interpolate the results using the same g() even though there is no guarantee that $m$ behaves like $a$, or: $m_o=g[f(a,t),o]=g(m,o)$ In some cases, they use the same logic when instead of $t$, there is some other variable $b$, i.e., it's not a time series, but $f(a,b)$ is a deterministic function.

An argument is used which concludes that the integrand is zero inside the sphere $S$. Using Gauss' theorem: $\int_S \vec F \cdot \mathrm d \vec S = \int_V \nabla \cdot \vec F \mathrm dV $. Since the calculation is not easy to explicitly calculate in (or on) $S$, instead it is shown that $\nabla \cdot \vec F = 0$ exterior to $S_{\epsilon}$, which is a sphere containing the singularity, and since $S$ is exterior to $S_{\epsilon}$ the integrand must be $0$ and so $\int_V \nabla \cdot \vec F \mathrm dV = 0$. $$S_{\epsilon}: |\vec r - \vec r_0 | = \epsilon, \epsilon > 0$$ translate the coordinate system so that $S_{\epsilon}$ is the origin in the translated system: $$\vec R = \vec r - \vec r_0 = R (\sin \theta \cos \phi, \sin \theta \sin \phi, \cos \theta)$$ $$F(\vec R) = k \frac{\vec R}{|\vec R|^3} = k \frac{1}{R^2} \hat R$$ $$S_{\epsilon}: |\vec R| = \epsilon$$ $$\nabla \cdot \vec F (\vec R) = \frac{1}{R^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial R} \left(R^2 \vec F_R \right) = \frac{1}{R^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial R} \left(R^2 k \frac{1}{R^2} \right) = 0$$, ($k$ is a constant) This is true for any value of $R$ except at the singularity ($\epsilon$ can be made as small as required), since $S$ does not contain the singularity, the integrand ($\nabla \cdot \vec F(\vec r)$ is 0 and the integral is therefore zero. My question (updated) I am having difficulties in explicitly calculating the value of this integral. 
Specifically, the divergence of the field becomes messy, I am not able to see how I can use the symmetry of $S$ due to $\vec r_0$. (When applying the Gauss' theorem, I am stuck in evaluating the divergence of the field). I am able to argue for that this integral is indeed zero (the field only has one singularity and it is exterior to the sphere $S$). However, I am not able to explicitly show (by calculation) that this integral is zero. Thankful for any help. Please note that this is not homework, I am studying for an exam. My question (original) What is an easy way to calculate this integral? Any suggestions on the approaches below? My apologies if this is due to lack of some basic knowledge (I am back studying after 2.5 years) Intuitively I understand the integral is zero (the point charge is located outside the sphere, anything flowing into the sphere will also flow out), however, I have issues with the calculation. Calculate directly $$\int_S \vec F \cdot \mathrm d \vec S = \int_0^{\pi} \mathrm d \theta \int_0^{2\pi} \mathrm d \phi r^2 \sin {\theta} \vec F_r \cdot \hat r = \int_0^{\pi} \mathrm d \theta \int_0^{2\pi} \mathrm d \phi r^2 \sin \theta k \frac{a - \frac{3a}{5} \left(  \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \theta \sin \phi - \cos \theta) \right)}{ {\left| \vec r - \vec r_0 \right|}^3 }$$ Using Gauss theorem I am tempted to use Gauss theorem, $\int_S \vec F \cdot \mathrm d \vec S = \int_V \nabla \cdot \vec F \mathrm dV $, in spherical coordinates. However $\vec F$ has components also in $\hat \theta$ and $\hat \phi$ (due to $\vec r_0$) and ${\left| \vec r - \vec r_0 \right|}^3$ is not that nice to derivate. $$\vec F_r = k \frac{\vec r - \vec r_0}{ {\left| \vec r - \vec r_0 \right|}^3 } \cdot \hat r = k \frac{r - \frac{3a}{5} \left(  \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \theta \sin \phi - \cos \theta) \right)}{ {\left| \vec r - \vec r_0 \right|}^3 }$$ $$\vec F_{\theta} = k \frac{\vec r - \vec r_0}{ {\left| \vec r - \vec r_0 \right|}^3 } \cdot \hat \theta = k \frac{ \frac{3a}{5} \left( \cos \theta \cos \phi + \cos \theta \sin \phi - \sin \theta) \right)}{ {\left| \vec r - \vec r_0 \right|}^3 }$$ $$\vec F_{\phi} = k \frac{\vec r - \vec r_0}{ {\left| \vec r - \vec r_0 \right|}^3 } \cdot \hat \phi = k \frac{ \frac{3a}{5} \left( - \sin \phi + \cos \phi ) \right)}{ {\left| \vec r - \vec r_0 \right|}^3 }$$ $$\nabla \cdot \vec F = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^2 \vec F_r \right) + \frac{1}{r \sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \left( \sin \theta F_{\theta} \right) + \frac{1}{r \sin \theta} \frac{\partial F_{\phi}}{\partial \phi}$$","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"

$L(f)(a) = \int_{f^{-1}(a)} d\mu $ 
where the measure $d\mu$ might be the induced measure from the metric on $R^n$, or it might also depend on the original $f$ in some intelligent way. For instance, if the initial function is $f:R^2 \rightarrow R$ is defined $f(x)=x^2+y^2$ then $L(f)(a) = 2 \pi \sqrt{a}$.

It seems that the point is that most elliptic integrals cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. The Wikipedia article defines an elliptic integral as an integral of the form $$\int R \left( x, \sqrt{ P(x) } \right ) \, dx$$ where $R(x, y)$ is a rational function and $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3$ or $4$ with no repeated roots. Now, the article does mention in its introductory section that two exceptions in which the elliptic integrals can be expressed in terms of elementary functions are when the polynomial $P(x)$ has repeated roots or when the rational function $R(x, y)$ does not contain odd powers of $y$. In the example in question we have $P(x) = 1 + x^4$ and $$R(x, y) = \frac{1 + x^2}{(1 - x^2)y}$$ so certainly it does not correspond to the two exceptions mentioned before. Thus I have a couple of questions about this: 1) What are the conditions for an elliptic integral (as defined in the Wikipedia article) to be expressible in terms of elementary functions? More specifically, are the two above cited conditions the only exceptions or are there any others which may explain why the above integral is expressible in terms of elementary functions? 2) Depending on the answer to my first question, why is it that the above ""elliptic integral"" can be expressed in terms of elementary functions?

Let $\mathcal{E}_\tau = \{ A \in \mathcal{E} : \tau^{-1}(A) = A \}$. In my lecture notes, it is claimed that a measurable function $f$ is invariant (i.e. $f \circ \tau = f$) if and only if it is measurable with respect to $\mathcal{E}_\tau$. This is evidently false: Let $E = \{ 0, 1 \}$, and let $\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{P}(E)$ be the power set. Let $\mu$ be the uniform distribution. Let $\tau$ act on $E$ by transposing 0 and 1. Let $f: (E, \mathcal{E}) \to (E, \mathcal{E}_\tau)$ be the identity map on $E$. Clearly, $f$ is measurable and not invariant. Yet it's also measurable with respect to $\mathcal{E}_\tau$: the preimage of every measurable set in its codomain is in $\mathcal{E}_\tau$, by construction. Have I misinterpreted the claim? If not, is there a similar claim which is true, e.g. by fixing the codomain of $f$?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"

15801,On nonintersecting loxodromes,"The (spherical) loxodrome , or the rhumb line, is the curve of constant bearing on the sphere; that is, it is the spherical curve that cuts the meridians of the sphere at a constant angle . A more picturesque way of putting it is that if one wants to travel from one point of a (spherical) globe to the antipodal point (say, from the North Pole to the South Pole) in a fixed direction, the path one would be taking on the globe would be a loxodrome. For a unit sphere, the loxodrome that cuts the meridians at an angle $\varphi\in\left(0,90^\circ\right]$ is given by $$\begin{align*}x&=\mathrm{sech}(t\cot\;\varphi)\cos\;t\\y&=\mathrm{sech}(t\cot\;\varphi)\sin\;t\\z&=\tanh(t\cot\;\varphi)\end{align*}$$ While playing around with loxodromes, I noted that for certain values of $\varphi$, one can orient two identical loxodromes such that they do not intersect (that is, one can position two ships such that if both take similar loxodromic paths, they can never collide). Here for instance are two loxodromes whose constant angle $\varphi$ is $60^\circ$, oriented such that they do not cross each other: On the other hand, for the (extreme!) case of $\varphi=90^{\circ}$, the two loxodromes degenerate to great circles, and it is well known that two great circles must always intersect (at two antipodal points). Less extreme, but seemingly difficult, would be the problem of positioning two 80° loxodromes such that they do not intersect: This brings me to my first question: 1) For what values of $\varphi$ does it become impossible to orient two loxodromes such that they do not cross each other? For simplicity, one can of course fix one of the two loxodromes to go from the North Pole to the South Pole, and try to orient the other loxodrome so that it does not cross the fixed loxodrome. That's the simpler version of my actual problem. Some experimentation seems to indicate that it is not possible to orient three loxodromes such that they do not cross each other. So... 2) Is it true that for all (admissible) values of $\varphi$, one cannot position three loxodromes such that none of them cross each other? I've tried a bit of searching around to see if the problem has been previously considered, but I have not had any luck. Any pointers to the literature will be appreciated.","['spheres', 'geometry']"

Now if we look at the powers of $2$ we will notice that they are $$\lbrace f_2(n)\rbrace=\lbrace 0,1,0,2,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,4\rbrace$$ and for the powers of $3$ we have $$\lbrace f_3(n)\rbrace=\lbrace 0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0\rbrace$$
This, of course, is a well known fact. Since then I wondered if there was a formula for $f_2(n)$ or $f_3(n)$ or $f_p(n)$, with $p\in \mathbb{P}$. It seemed impossible but I was able to devise the suitable formulas. They are
$$\displaystyle\begin{align} f_2(n)=\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{r}{{2^{r+1}}}\sum_{k=0}^{2^{r+1}-1}\cos\left( \frac{2k\pi(n+2^{r})}{2^{r+1}} \right)\end{align}$$
and for the general case we have
$$\displaystyle f_p(n)=\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{r}{p^{r+1}}\sum_{j=1}^{p-1}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p^{r+1}-1}\cos\left( \frac{2k\pi(n+(p-j)p^{r})}{p^{r+1}} \right)\right)$$
If one cares to analyse the formula for $f_p(n)$ it can be concluded that it needs not to be restricted to the prime numbers, so that we have $f_m(n), m \in \mathbb{N}$ and similar  patterns for $\lbrace f_m(n)\rbrace$ will result. Now, the wonderfull thing is that we can express the arithmetical divisor functions $\sigma_k(n)$ in terms of $f_m(n)$ as follows
$$\displaystyle \sigma_a(n)=1+\sum_{m=2}^{\infty}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{m^{a}}{m^{r+1}}\sum_{j=1}^{m-1}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{m^{r+1}-1}\cos\left( \frac{2k\pi(n+(m-j)m^{r})}{m^{r+1}} \right)\right)$$
And, if we consider the divisor summatory function , $D(n)$, as
$$D(n)=\sum_{m \leq n}d(m)$$
with $$d(n)=\sigma_{0}(n)=\sum_{d|n}1$$
we can express $D(n)$ as 
$$D(n)=\sum_{m=2}^{\infty}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{r}{m^{r+1}}\sum_{j=1}^{m-1}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{m^{r+1}-1}\cos\left( \frac{2k\pi(2^{n}+(m-j)m^{r})}{m^{r+1}} \right)\right)$$
Now, we know that, $d(n)$ and $D(n)$ are related to the Riemann zeta-function by
$$\zeta^{2}(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{d(n)}{n^{z}}$$
and 
$$\zeta^{2}(z)=z\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{D(x)}{x^{z+1}}dx$$ Now, my questions What can we say about the convergence of $f_m(z)$, $\sigma_a(z)$ and $D(z)$ with $z \in \mathbb{C}$? We can see that they converge for $z \in \mathbb{N}$. I think that $\sigma_a(z)$ and $D(z)$ are only curiosities and aren't interesting in the context of the Riemann zeta-function because they are hard to compute. What do you think? Are formulas $f_m(z)$, $\sigma_a(z)$ and $D(z)$ original. I think they are. I'd like to know if anyone has found something like this before. I've posted this as an answer to this post sometime ago. Finally, is this intereting enough to publish somewhere? I'm just an amateur... To conclude I'd like to apologise for presenting all this formulas without showing how I got them but you can consider this previous post of mine and the question Greatest power of two dividing an integer , Difficult Infinite Sum and On the 61-st, the 62-nd, and the 63-rd Smarandache's problem page 38.

&1\;\;\;\text{ if } n \in \mathbb{P} \\
&\\
&\\
&0\;\;\;\text{ if } n \notin \mathbb{P}

$$ I have found that $u(n)$ is given by the following formula $$

15866,"arc-arc intersection, arcs specified by endpoints and height","I need to compute the intersection(s) between two circular arcs. Each arc is specified by its endpoints and their height. The height is the perpendicular distance from the chord connecting the endpoints to the middle of the arc. I use this representation because it is numerically robust for very slightly bent arcs, as well as straight line segments, for which the height is zero. In these cases, representing an arc using the center of its circle could lead to the center being far far away from the endpoints of the arc, and hence, numerically unstable. My question at the highest level is how I would go about computing the intersection points, given that the centers of the circles of the arcs cannot necessarily be computed robustly. At a lower level, I am wondering if there is a parameterization of an arc using only the information I have stated above (which does not include the circle center). Of course, keep in mind numerical robustness is my principal concern here; otherwise I would just do the naive thing and compute the circle center for all non-linear arcs and hope for the best. Edit : Formula for computing center of circle of arcs: Suppose the chord length is $2t$, and the height is $h$. The distance from the chord to the circle center is $c$, so that $r=h+c$. Then it follows that $c=(t^2-h^2)/2h$, which breaks down when $h$ is very small.

15875,When is a function satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations holomorphic?,"It is, of course, one of the first results in basic complex analysis that a holomorphic function satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations when considered as a differentiable two-variable real function. I have always seen the converse as: if $f$ is continuously differentiable as a function from $U \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$ and satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, then it is holomorphic (see e.g. Stein and Shakarchi, or Wikipedia ). Why is the $C^1$ condition necessary? I don't see where this comes in to the proof below. Assume that $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ are continuously differentiable and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Let $h=h_1 + h_2i$. Then \begin{equation*}
u(x+h_1, y+h_2) - u(x,y) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} h_1 + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}h_2 + o(|h|)
\end{equation*}
and 
\begin{equation*}
v(x+h_1, y+h_2) - v(x,y) = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} h_1 + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} h_2 + o(|h|).
\end{equation*}
Multiplying the second equation by $i$ and adding the two together gives

(u+iv)(z+h)-(u+iv)(z) &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} h_1 + i \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} h_1 + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} h_2 + i \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} h_2 + o(|h|)\\\
 &= \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \right) (h_1+i h_2) + o(|h|).

Let $Y$ be a Hausdorff space and assume that each $y \in Y$ has a neighborhood $V$ such that $\overline{V}$ is regular. Prove $Y$ is regular. Proof: In order to show that $Y$ is regular we are going to show that for each $y \in Y$ and each open set $U$ which contains $y$ there exists an open neighborhood $W$ of $y$ such that $y \in W \subseteq \overline{W} \subseteq U$. First observation: since regularity is hereditary then $V$ is regular. Now let $y \in Y$ and $U$ a neighborhood of $y$. By assumption there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $y$ such that $\overline{V}$ is regular and hence $V$ is regular. Observe $U \cap V$ is a non-empty subset of $V$ and this set is open in $V$ as well. Since $V$ is regular we can find a non-empty subset $S$ of $V$ such that: $S \subseteq \overline{S} \subseteq U \cap V \subseteq U$ But since $V$ is open then $S$ is open in $X$ so the same set $S$ given by regularity of $V$ shows that $U$ is regular as well.

15955,Density of zeros of a power series over the reals,"Let $f(x) = \sum_{i =0}^\infty a_i x^i$ be a power series which converges for all real $x$. Assume that $f(x)$ is not identically zero. I'm interested in the density of the zeros of $f(x)$. Let $Z$ be the set of zeros of $f(x)$. Which of the following claims about density of $Z$ are true? Claim 1: $Z$ is nowhere dense. Claim 2: $Z$ is countable. Claim 3: For any $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ , $Z \cap [a,b]$ is finite. I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) that claim 3 implies the other two. I suspect all three claims are true. I suspect that the answers to these questions are well-known, though I was not able to find an obvious reference. Can anyone suggest a reference with a nice treatment of these questions?","['power-series', 'analysis']"
15963,What is the intuition for the point-set topology definition of continuity?,"Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is defined as continuous if for each open set $U \subset Y$, $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. This definition makes sense to me when $X$ and $Y$ are metric spaces- it is equivalent to the usual $\epsilon-\delta$ definition. But why is this a good definition when $X$ and $Y$ are not metric spaces? 
How should we think about this definition intuitively?","['general-topology', 'intuition']"
15966,Ramanujan's First Letter to Hardy and the Number of $3$-Smooth Integers,"A positive integer is $B$-smooth if and only if all of its prime divisors are less than or equal to a positive real $B$. For example, the $3$-smooth integers are of the form $2^{a} 3^{b}$ with non-negative exponents $a$ and $b$, and those integers less than or equal to $20$ are $\{1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,16,18\}$. In Ramanujan's first letter to G. H. Hardy, Ramanujan emphatically quotes (without proof) his result on the number of $3$-smooth integers less than or equal to $N > 1$,
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\log 2 N \ \log 3N}{2 \log 2 \ \log 3}.
\end{eqnarray}
This is an amazingly accurate approximation, as it differs from the exact value by less than 3 for the first $2^{1000} \approx 1.07 \times 10^{301}$ integers, as shown by Pillai. Question : Knowing full well that Ramanujan only gave proofs of his own claims while working in England, I wonder if a proof of this particular estimate appears somewhere in the literature. Is this problem still open? If not, what is a reference discussing its proof? Thanks!","['analytic-number-theory', 'reference-request', 'real-analysis', 'number-theory']"
15970,Does closed set contain only boundary points or interior points also?,"I am reading this . It says Intuitively, an open set is a solid region minus its boundary. If we include the boundary, we get a closed set, which formally is defined as the complement of an open set. Now, question is if a closed set includes interior points also then how can it be complement ? I know basic set theory.
Enlighten me! :) Thanks!","['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Can anybody think of any more nice, relatively elementary proofs of this result? Thanks in advance.","['alternative-proof', 'number-theory']"

15984,Does $\sum \limits_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\sin n}{n}(1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n})$ converge (absolutely)?,"I've had no luck with this one. None of the convergence tests pop into mind. I tried looking at it in this form $\sum \sin n\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}{n}$ and apply Dirichlets test. I know that $\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}{n} \to 0$ but not sure if it's decreasing. Regarding absolute convergence, I tried: $$|\sin n\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}{n}|\geq \sin^2 n\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}{n}=$$ $$=\frac{1}{2}\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}{n}-\frac{1}{2}\cos 2n\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}{n}$$ But again I'm stuck with $\cos 2n\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}{n}$. Assuming it converges then I've shown that $\sum \sin n\frac{1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}}{n}$ doesn't converge absolutely.","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"

16000,"question regarding Waterhouse, affine group schemes","Excerpt from Waterhouse, 14.4 Structure of Finite Connected groups. Thm. Let $A$ represent a finite connected group scheme over a perfect field of characteristic $p$. Then $A$ has the form $k[X_1, ..., X_n]/(X_1^{p^{e_1}}, \ldots, X_n^{p^{e_n}})$. Proof. Let $I_A$ be the augmentation ideal of $A$. By connectedness, $I_A$ is nilpotent. [...] We assume therefore that the Hopf subalgebra $B = A^p$ is one of these truncated polynomial algebras, say with generators $x_i$ and relations $x_i^{q_i} = 0$. Choose $y_i \in A$ with $y_i^p = x_i$, and choose also a set $\{z_j\}$ in $A$ maximal with resprect to the requirements that $z_j^p = 0$ and that the $z_j$ be linearly independent in $I_A/I_A^2$. Let $C = k[Y_i, Z_j]/(Y_i^

{pq_i}, Z_j^p$ which maps in the obvious way to $A$. We claim that this map is an iso. Embed $A^p$ in $C$ by $x_i \mapsto Y_i^p$. Then $C$ is a free $B$-module. By the main theorem, $A$ is also free over $A^p$. As in (14.2), then, it is enough to show that $C/I_BC \to A/I_BA$ is an iso. I don't understand the last sentence.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-groups']"
