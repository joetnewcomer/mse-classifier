4693931,Prove that two finite sets have the same cardinality if and only if there exists a bijection between them,"The textbook ""Discrete Mathematics with Applications"" by Thomas Koshy states a theorem (3.5): For function $f: X \rightarrow  Y$ , where $X$ is the finite domain and $Y$ is the finite co-domain Two finite sets have the same cardinality if and only if there exists
a bijection between them. I can prove that if $f$ is a bijective function then $|X| = |Y|$ .
However, I am struggling to understand Koshy's proof for the biconditional part.
For example, in the case below where $|X| = |Y|$ , the sets have the same cardinality but are not bijective: $X = \{-2,-1,1,2\}$ $Y = \{0, 1, 2, 4\}$ $f(x) = x^2$ Any ideas if Koshy's proof is wrong, or if not, how one would go about proving this? edit: adding Koshy's proof below Let $X$ and $Y$ be two finite sets with $|X| = m$ and $|Y| = n$ .
Let $X = \{x_1, . . . , x_m\}$ .
Let $f : X → Y$ be bijective.
Since $f$ is injective, $f(x_1), . . . , f (x_m)$ are $m$ distinct elements in $Y$ . Consequently, $m \leq n$ . Since $f$ is surjective, every element $y$ in $Y$ has at least one input in $X$ , so $n \leq m$ . Thus $|X| = |Y|$ . Conversely, suppose $m = n$ and $Y = \{y_1, . . . , y_m\}$ . Define a function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ by $f(x_i) = y_i$ for every $i$ . We will now show that f is injective. Let $x_j$ and $x_k$ be two elements in $X$ such that $f (x_j) = f (x_k)$ . Then, by definition, $y_j = y_k$ ; so, $j = k$ and hence $x_j = x_k$ . Therefore, $f$ is injective and hence, by Theorem 3.4, $f$ is bijective. Theorem 3.4: Let $X$ and $Y$ be any two finite sets with $|X| = |Y| = n$ . A function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is injective if and only if $f$ is surjective.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

4694057,Is $\cos^2A+\cos^2B+\cos^2C+2 \cos A \cos B \cos C=1$ both Necessary and Sufficient for a triangle,"When $P^2+Q^2+R^2+2PQR=1$ , one can show that all of $|P|,|Q|,|R|$ are either $\ge 1$ or $\le 1$ . One of the consequences of this is the trigonometric identity in a triangle: $$\cos^2 A+ \cos^2 B+ \cos^2 C+2 \cos A \cos B \cos C=1.$$ We want to point out that it is only necessary but not sufficient for forming a triangle. Given $\cos A, \cos B$ , we can set up the quadratic $$\cos^2 C + (2\cos A \cos B) \cos C+ \cos^2 A+ \cos^2 B-1=0,\quad (*)$$ We get two roots for $C: C_1, C_2$ , then either  ABC $_1$ or ABC $_2$ , will be a triangle such that $A+B+C=\pi$ .

On the other hand the identity $\tan A+ \tan B + \tan C=\tan A \tan B \tan C$ is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of a triangle.

4694060,Unable to reason about game theory question involving marbles,"Here is the prompt: You choose to put 1-100 marbles in a bag. Your opponent also has the
same option. Then we pick one marble from the bag. If your marble gets
picked from the bag you get the amount of marbles you did not put in
as your payout. So if you put in 20 marbles and your marble gets
picked you get 80. What is the optimal number of marbles to put in? I understand the basics of game theory and Nash equilibria but I don't know how to reason about a question like this where the opponent has so many options. Here is what I have so far: If the opponent picks $k$ marbles then I should pick $j$ marbles to maximize my payout, where the payout is given by $$\frac{j}{j + k} (100 - j)$$ using the definition of expected value. However, clearly the value of $j$ that optimizes this function varies with respect to $k$ , the number of marbles the opponent picks. I am guessing I need to use the value of $k$ that the opponent would pick if they were to maximize their own payout, but I don't know how to find that.

4694176,"Hartshorne AG, proof of proposition 5.7 and 5.8: ""The question is local, so we may assume $X$ is affine ...""","On several instances, Hartshorne states that certain questions are ""local"". What is the reasoning behind it? Some instances in the text by Hartshorne, algebraic geometry, occur on p. 114 f., proof of proposition 5.7, or proof of proposition 5.8. In section 5 chapter 2, quasi-coherent sheaves are discussed. Quasi-coherent sheaves deal with $\mathcal{O}_X$ -modules, which on some open covers of $X$ are isomorphic to a sheaf associated to a $A_i$ -module for some appropriately chosen ring $A_i$ . The elements of the open covers each equal the spectrum of a ring $A_i$ . Proposition 5.7 deals with a scheme $X$ , which is not necessarily affine, and states that kernels, cokernels and images of morphisms between quasi-coherent sheaves $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ on $X$ are quasi-coherent. Hartshorne simply states in the proof that by localness of the question, affineness can be assumed. I interpret it in the way that quasi-coherence requires that the restriction of a sheaf of modules to each element of some open covering is isomorphic to $\widetilde{M_{i}}$ where $M_{i}$ is a module over a ring $A_{i}$ with $\text{Spec}(A_{i})=U_{i}$ . An interpretation of the Hartshorne's explanation is that the property in question can be checked on the stalks. By proposition 1.1., p. 63 a morphism of sheaves on $X$ is an isomorphism if and only if the induced map on the stalks at $P$ is an isomorphism for each element $P$ of the topological space $X$ . Certainly for an affine structure, the stalk of a sheaf of $A_i$ -modules at $\mathfrak{p}$ is isomorphic to the localisation $(\widetilde{M_i})_{\mathfrak{p}}$ , where $M_i\cong \Gamma(\text{Spec}(A_i),\widetilde{M_i})$ (proposition 5.1 (b) and (d)). An alternative interpretation might be that localness refers to the open covers $\{U_i\}_i$ , but I am sightly doubtful about the latter interpretation. In part (a) of  proposition 5.8, the assumption of quasi-coherence of $\mathcal{G}$ is a local property on $X$ and $Y$ . Also the claim regarding $f^{*} \mathcal{G}$ relates to quasi-coherence. I wonder why in proposition 5.8 part (c) it is claimed in the proof that the question is local on $Y$ only. Especially part (c) of proposition 5.8 is unclear to me, but the other occurences of the approach ""the question is local, so affineness can be assumed"", remain unclear to me, as well.",['algebraic-geometry']

The process $X$ is called fractional Brownian motion of Riemann-Liouville type with Hurst parameter $H.$ I have read in various articles that it is well-known that $X$ is not a semimartingale. I am trying to understand why this statement is true. However, I find it difficult to show this. I tried approximating the non-differentiable kernel $K(t)=\frac{t^{H-1/2}}{\Gamma(H+1/2)}$ by continuously differentiable kernels, $\varepsilon>0,$ $$
K_\varepsilon(t)= \frac{(t+\varepsilon)^{H-1/2}}{\Gamma(H+1/2)}.
$$ Then, an application of the stochastic Fubini theorem shows that $$
X_t^\varepsilon = \int_0^t K_\varepsilon(t-s) dB_s

This just shifts $A-A$ to the right. Some negative elements might change into positive ones, but we do not care about that. What is important is, that every positive element stays positive. Therefore again, this set contains more or equally as many positive than negative elements. Now it gets tricky. My next idea is to look at the set $a_2 + A - A$ and take the union with the set $a_1 + A - A$ . I want to do this with every $a_i$ . That means in the end I take the following union: $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}a_i + A - A$ which is exactly $ A+A-A$ . I want to prove at each step that there are still more or equal positive than negative elements in the current set. My idea to do this is to think of the following: Since $A-A$ was symmetric around $0$ , I can split $A-A$ into elements that are $>0$ and elements that are $<0$ (we do not care about the $0$ ). These two subsets have the same size. If we add an $a_i$ to a positive element, we have two cases: case: We get a new element that does not already occur in our union of sets.
In this case we do not have to do anything. case: We get a duplicant. In this case we need to show that we also get a unique duplicant if we add $a_i$ to a certain negative element. I do not want to go into too much detail, but I was very close to find a method for the 2. case. It always gave me a negative duplicant, but was not unique in very few specific cases. If somebody has an idea for this problem, maybe even with a complete other method, I would be very grateful to hear and also very excited to discuss it. Thank you very much.",['combinatorics']
4695187,Is the following function continuous? Has partial derivatives?,"Let $f(t)$ be a differentiable function for every $t$ such that $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$ . Define: $$
g(x,y)=\begin{cases}
\frac{f(x)^2 + f(y)^2}{x^2+y^2}, &\quad (x,y)\neq(0,0) \\
1 &\quad (x,y)=(0,0).
\end{cases}
$$ Is $g$ continuous at $(0,0)$ ? Do the partial derivatives $g_x(0,0),g_y(0,0)$ exist? My attempt:
We know that $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x)=0$ and $\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{f(x)}{x}=1$ . Therefore $\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{f(x)^2}{x^2}=1$ .
In particular, taking the paths $y=0$ or $x=0$ leads to $\lim_{x\to 0} g(x,0)= \lim_{y\to 0} g(0,y)=0$ . Trying polar coordinates leads to $g(r \cos \theta , r\sin \theta) = \frac{f(r\cos \theta) ^2 + f(r\sin \theta)^2 }{r^2}$ for $r\neq 0$ . If hypothetically I would have known that somehow this limit is zero for any choice of $\theta$ , this would solve the problem, but we don't know that since we don't have $f(r)^2 $ in the numerator. First question: How can I prove the function is continuous at $(0,0)$ ? As for partial derivatives:
Using the definition, we need to calculate $$
\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{g(h,0)-g(0,0) }{h } = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(h)^2-h^2 }{h^3 }.
$$ My intuition is that this limit doesn't exist, but choosing $f(x)=sin(x)$ or $f(x)=x$ seems to do work. So, second question is: What might be a possible counterexample for the existence of partial derivatives? Thank you","['limits', 'multivariable-calculus']"
4695193,Approximate tangent space agrees with tangent space of submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$,"I am stuck on trying to prove that the approximate tangent space of a submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ agrees with its tangent space. To make things more precise I'll give the relevant definitions. Note that $\mathcal{H}^k$ denotes the $k$ -dimensional Hausdorff measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathcal{L}_n$ denotes Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Definition. (Approximate tangent space) Let $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ be a $\mathcal{H}^k$ -measurable set such that $\mathcal{H}^k(E\cap K)<\infty$ for all compact $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ . and let $P$ be a $k$ -dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . We say that $P$ is the approximate tangent space of $E$ at $x\in E$ if $$\lim_{\lambda\downarrow0}\int_{\frac{E-x}{\lambda}}f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k=\int_P f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k$$ for all compactly supported continuous $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ . Definition. (Tangent space) Let $M$ be a $k$ -dimensional $C^1$ -submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , and let $x\in M$ . We define the tangent space of $M$ at $x$ , denoted $\mathrm{T}_xM$ , as the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ consisting of all vectors $v$ such that $v=\gamma'(0)$ for some $C^1$ -curve $\gamma:(-1,1)\to M$ with $\gamma(0)=x$ . What I am trying to prove is that if $M$ is a $k$ -dimensional $C^1$ -submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , then $\mathrm{T}_xM$ is also the approximate tangent space of $M$ at $x$ . In particular then what I need to show is that $$\lim_{\lambda\downarrow0}\int_{\frac{M-x}{\lambda}}f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k=\int_{\mathrm{T}_xM} f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k$$ for all compactly supported continuous $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ . Before giving my attempt, I'll also state the Area formula, which I'm using. Theorem. (Area formula) Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ be Lipschitz, where $n\leq m$ , and let $g\in\mathscr{L}^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ . Then $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}gJf~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{L}_n=\int_{\mathbb{R}^m}\sum_{x\in f^{-1}(\{y\})}g(x)~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^n(y),$$ where $$Jf(x)=\sqrt{\det(Df(x)^*\circ Df(x))},$$ with $^*$ denoting the adjoint. The following is what I've tried so far: We consider first when we can parameterize all of $M$ by a $C^1$ -map $\psi:V\to M$ on some open set $V\subseteq\mathbb{R}^k$ . Suppose without loss of generality that $\psi(0)=x$ . We have that $$\mathrm{T}_xM=\mathrm{span}\{\partial_1\psi(0),\dots,\partial_k\psi(0)\},$$ and so in particular we can consider the function $h:\mathbb{R}^k\to\mathrm{T}_xM$ defined by $$h(y)=D\psi(0)y,$$ which gives us an isomorphism, and in particular $h$ is Lipschitz with $$Jh(y)=J\psi(0)$$ for all $y\in\mathbb{R}^k$ , and so by the Area formula we have that $$\int_{\mathrm{T}_xM} f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k=\int_{\mathbb{R}^k}f(D\psi(0)y)J\psi(0)~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{L}_k(y).$$ Now take $\lambda>0$ , define $\eta_\lambda:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ by $$\eta_\lambda(y)=\frac{y-x}{\lambda},$$ and observe that $\eta_\lambda\circ\psi$ then parameterizes $\frac{M-x}{\lambda}$ , and $$J(\eta_\lambda\circ\psi)=\frac{1}{\lambda^k}J\psi.$$ We thus have, again by the Area formula, that $$\int_{\frac{M-x}{\lambda}} f~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}^k=\int_V f\left(\frac{\psi(y)-x}{\lambda}\right)\frac{J\psi(y)}{\lambda^k}~\mathrm{d}\mathcal{L}_k(y).$$ At this point I suppose I want to let $\lambda\downarrow0$ and use some convergence theorem to show that this integral converges to the previous one. I am however stuck on how to actually do this, and so need help on how to progress from here (assuming my idea even works and is correct so far). Edit: So I realized that if $y\neq0$ , then $\psi(y)\neq x$ , which means that $\frac{\psi(y)-x}{\lambda}$ is outside of the support of $f$ for sufficiently small $\lambda$ . This means that we have that $$\lim_{\lambda\downarrow0}f\left(\frac{\psi(y)-x}{\lambda}\right)\frac{J\psi(y)}{\lambda^k}=0$$ for all $y\neq0$ . I'm a bit unsure about how useful this actually is right now, but I'll try to investigate what happens when $y=0$ when I get home, and hopefully get some useful behavior out of the integral.","['tangent-spaces', 'geometric-measure-theory', 'differential-geometry']"

Most of the parity restrictions are easy enough to cast as kernels of group homomorphisms: the restriction on cubie placement can be interpreted as taking a group homomorphism from the larger group to $S_{20}$ , and then composing with the sign homomorphism to $\{ \pm 1 \}$ , and taking the kernel.  Similarly, the edge orientation restriction can be interpreted as taking a group homomorphism from the larger group to $S_{24}$ (taking the corresponding permutation of edge stickers), and then again composing with the sign homomorphism to $\{ \pm 1 \}$ , and taking the kernel. What's left is the restriction on corner orientation.  I have seen descriptions of corresponding functions from the larger group to $\mathbb{Z} / 3 \mathbb{Z}$ ; what is not clear to me is whether any of these functions gives a homomorphism of groups.

4695331,Definition of stabilizer of a point in a stack,"I was reading in Adeel Khan's ''A Modern Introduction to Algebraic Stacks'' and came across the definition of the stabilizer of an $R$ -valued point $x$ of a stack $X$ . My question will be about that the definition does not quite make intuitive sense to me, but let me first make some definitions. The eventual questions are bold-faced. I look at stacks as $(2,1)$ -sheaves $\mathrm{Sch}^\mathrm{op}_\mathrm{fppf}\to\mathsf{Grpd}$ in the fppf-topology, where $\mathsf{Grpd}$ is the $(2,1)$ -category of groupoids. Then, given an $R$ -valued point $x\colon\mathrm{Spec}\,R\to X$ in $X(R)$ , we define the stabilizer of $x$ in $X$ as the pullback (in the $(2,1)$ -category of stacks) $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD}
{\mathrm{St}_X(x)} @>>> {\mathrm{Spec}\,R}\\
@V V V @VV x V\\
{\mathrm{Spec}\,R} @>>x> X
\end{CD} We can also define the intertia stack $\mathcal{I}_X$ of $X$ by the pullback $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD}
{\mathcal{I}_X} @>>> X\\
@V V V @VV \Delta V\\
X @>>\Delta> X\times X
\end{CD} where $\Delta\colon X\to X\times X$ is the diagonal. Because $\mathrm{Spec}\,R$ is a set-valued stack, I can find that for any ring $R'$ , the groupoid $\mathrm{St}_X(x)(R')$ is actually the set of triples $(y,z,\varphi)$ with $y,z\colon R\to R'$ maps of rings, and $\varphi\colon x|_y\to x|_z$ an isomorphism in $X(R')$ . Now comes my question: why do we call this a stabilizer of $x$ in $X$ ? I would expect that a stabilizer consists of all the automorphisms of $x$ , in some sense. More precisely, I would expect the $R'$ -valued points of the stabilizer to consist precisely of a groupoid with objects $x|_y$ for all $y\colon R\to R'$ , and morphisms the automorphisms of these $x|_y$ in $X(R')$ . This is not what $\mathrm{St}_X(x)$ does: we get not only automorphisms, but just general isomorphisms between different restrictions of $x$ , and we only have a set, and not a groupoid. All in all, it seems like it is not completely resembling a stabilizer. Does anyone have an explanation why this is then the correct notion of the stabilizer of $x$ ? Why do we want to look at isomorphisms between different restrictions of $x$ ? When I compute the $R'$ -valued points of $\mathcal{I}_X$ , I find that $\mathcal{I}_X(R')$ is equivalent to a groupoid consisting of objects $(y,\alpha)$ , with $y\in X(R')$ and $\alpha\colon y\to y$ a morphism in $X(R')$ . The morphisms $(y,\alpha)\to(y',\alpha')$ in this groupoid are morphisms $\zeta\colon y\to y'$ in $X(R')$ such that $\alpha=\zeta^{-1}\alpha'\zeta$ . So $\mathcal{I}_X(R')$ has the automorphisms of $R'$ -valued points of $X$ as objects, and their conjugations as morphisms. This seems much closer to what I would want from a stabilizer, but this is of course not the stabilizer of a single point. We can remedy this by defining for $x\colon\mathrm{Spec}\,R\to X$ a stack $F_x$ by a pullback $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD}
{F_x} @>>> {\mathcal{I}_X}\\
@V V V @VV \pi V\\
{\mathrm{Spec}\,R} @>>x> X
\end{CD} where $\pi\colon\mathcal{I}_X\to X$ maps an object $(y,\alpha)$ to $y$ and a morphism $\zeta\colon(y,\alpha)\to(y',\alpha')$ to $\zeta\colon y\to y'$ . I can show that for a ring $R'$ the groupoid $F_x(R')$ is actually equivalent to the set consisting of pairs $(y,\omega)$ , for $y\colon R\to R'$ and $\omega\colon x|_y\to x|_y$ in $X(R')$ . In other words, $F_x$ collects all automorphisms of restrictions of $x$ to $R'$ into a set, but forgets about the conjugations (which is not weird, given its definition). Now, this seems more like a stabilizer to me than $\mathrm{St}_X(x)$ , where we also allow isomorphisms between different restrictions of $x$ . Why is this not the definition of the stabilizer of $x$ ? As an aside, via the definition of $\mathrm{St}_X(x)$ we have a pullback $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD}
{\mathrm{St}_X(x)} @>>> {\mathrm{Spec}\,R}\\
@V V V @VV (x,\mathrm{id}_x) V\\
{F_x} @>>> {\mathcal{I}_X}
\end{CD} So we can recover $\mathrm{St}_X(x)$ from $F_x$ by ''further restriction'' along the identity automorphism of $x$ . Because this is a $(2,1)$ -pullback, it is of course not purely a restriction, but it seems still like $F_x$ is a slightly more powerful stack.","['algebraic-stacks', 'algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory']"

Not prone to rapid inflation or deflation Doesn't encourage players to ""protect"" their rating Doesn't allow manipulation of pairings to create  beneficial match ups Preferably includes a margin of victory multiplier to encourage teams to continue to play to the best of their ability even when very far behind in a game. This would imply that it can predict the margin of victory as well as the probability of win/loss. Low computation requirements and easy to implement in a spreadsheet Options Elo is perhaps the best-known rating system made popular from its use by FIDE but has many well-known flaws . It also needs to be adapted to allow tracking individual ratings when only team results are known. Perhaps it can be altered to take into account margin of victory by scaling the scores from 0-1 instead of 0 for a loss, 1 for a win and 1/2 for a draw? Another system is the KGS rank system . A frequently-used improvement upon Elo's work is the Glicko-2 system . It introduced concepts such as rating volatility, improves prediction reliability and has replaced the use of Elo on many rating leagues. However, it also doesn't account for teams made of of pairings from a pool. Rating systems that do account for this include Microsoft's TrueSkill2 but this is a licensed system.  Another method would be to use Glicko-2 treating each 2v2 match it as 4 individual simultaneous matches. Nate Silver also apparently uses some sort of algorithm for team sports . There are some similar questions but, as far as I can see, none take into account both the margin of victory and individual ratings in team matches. Does anyone have any suggestions for a simple rating algorithm to use?","['statistics', 'probability', 'algorithms']"

4695700,Does Taylor's theorem (Peano's form) generalize to other fields?,"Let $\mathbb F$ be a field with a non-trivial absolute value, such as $\mathbb F_p(X)$ or $\mathbb Q$ or $\mathbb Q_p$ , and let $f:\mathbb F\to\mathbb F$ be a function. Limits, continuity, and derivatives are defined as usual: $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=b$ means that for any real $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $\delta>0$ such that, for all $x\in\mathbb F$ where $0<|x-a|<\delta$ , $|f(x)-b|<\varepsilon$ . We say that $f$ is $n$ th-order Peano differentiable at $a$ , if there's a polynomial $\sum_{k=0}^nc_kx^k$ and a function $h$ continuous at $h(0)=0$ such that $$f(a+x)=\sum_{k=0}^nc_kx^k+x^nh(x).$$ Suppose $f$ has both ordinary derivatives and Peano derivatives up to order $n$ at $a$ . Must they be proportional, $$f^{(k)}(a)=k!\,c_k\quad?$$ Related: In characteristic $2$, can a function have a non-zero second derivative? A function may have Peano derivatives but not ordinary derivatives of order $n$ . Here's an example with $\mathbb F=\mathbb R$ (I suppose a similar example could be constructed for $\mathbb F=\mathbb Q$ using $2^{\lfloor-1/x^2\rfloor}$ on the dyadic rationals): $$f(x)=\begin{cases}e^{-1/x^2},\quad x\in\mathbb Q\setminus\{0\}; \\ 0,\quad\text{otherwise};\end{cases}$$ this satisfies $f(0+x)=0+0x+\cdots+0x^n+x^nh(x)$ where $\lim_{x\to0}h(x)=0$ . But $f''(0)$ doesn't exist, because $f'(x)$ doesn't exist in a neighbourhood of $0$ , because $f(x)$ is not continuous in a neighbourhood of $0$ . Conversely, a function may have ordinary derivatives but not Peano derivatives of order $n$ . An example with $\mathbb F=\mathbb Q_p$ is given here : $$f(x)=\begin{cases}p^{2m},\quad x=p^m+yp^{2m+1},\quad y\in\mathbb Z_p,\quad m\in\mathbb N; \\ 0,\quad\text{otherwise};\end{cases}$$ this satisfies $f'(x)=0$ for all $x$ , hence $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ for all $n>1$ . But $\lim_{x\to0}f(x)/x^2$ doesn't exist, so $f$ can't have a $2$ nd-order Peano derivative; $f(0+x)=0+0x+c_2x^2+x^2h(x)$ would imply that the limit exists as $c_2$ .","['p-adic-number-theory', 'analysis', 'field-theory', 'taylor-expansion', 'derivatives']"
4695727,Limit of $L^p$ norm of a function depending on $p$,"Background Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space (or a finite measure space).
Then, it is well-known that, for a fixed function $f$ with $\lVert f \rVert_\infty := \mathrm{ess.sup}_{x} \lvert f(x) \rvert < \infty$ , we have $$
\lVert f \rVert_p := \left( \int |f|^p \, dP \right)^{1/p}
\ 
\overset{p \to \infty}{\rightarrow}
\ 
\lVert f \rVert_\infty
\text{.}
$$ (See, e.g., this question .) I'm curious what happens if $f$ depends on $p$ .
More precisely, suppose we have a sequence of functions $\{f_p\}_{p=1}^\infty \subset L^\infty$ that converges to $f \in L^\infty$ a.s.
Do we always have $
\lim_{p \to \infty} \lVert f_p \rVert_p
=
\lVert f \rVert_\infty
$ ?
If not always, under what conditions? What I've tried so far Maybe one of the possible sufficient conditions is that $|f_p| \nearrow |f|$ almost surely.
Under this condition, we can prove $\lim_{p \to \infty} \lVert f_p \rVert_p
= \lVert f \rVert_\infty$ as follows. By the assumption, for any $p = 1, 2, \ldots$ , we have $|f_p| \leq |f| \leq \lVert f \rVert_\infty$ a.s.
So the monotonicity of integral implies $\int |f_p|^p \, dP \leq \lVert f \rVert_\infty^p$ , which proves $\limsup_{p \to \infty} \lVert f_p \rVert_p \leq \lVert f \rVert_\infty$ . Now we are going to prove $\liminf_{p \to \infty} \lVert f_p \rVert_p \geq \lVert f \rVert_\infty$ .
To this end, fix any $\epsilon > 0$ and define the events $A_p(\epsilon) := \{|f_p| > \lVert f \rVert_\infty - \epsilon\}$ for $p = 1, 2, \ldots$ .
Then, we have \begin{align}
\int_\Omega |f_p|^p \, dP
\geq 
\int_{A_p(\epsilon)} |f_p|^p \, dP
\geq 
\int_{A_p(\epsilon)} (\lVert f \rVert_\infty - \epsilon)^p \, dP
=
P(A_p(\epsilon)) (\lVert f \rVert_\infty - \epsilon)^p
\end{align} and therefore $$
\lVert f_p \rVert_p
\geq 
P(A_p(\epsilon))^{1/p} (\lVert f \rVert_\infty - \epsilon)
\text{.}
$$ Now, $|f_p| \nearrow |f|$ implies $A_p(\epsilon) \nearrow A(\epsilon) := \{|f| > \lVert f \rVert_\infty - \epsilon\}$ .
Noting that $A(\epsilon)$ is a positive constant (by the definition of $\lVert f \rVert_\infty$ ), by the continuity of measure, we have $$
\lim_{p \to \infty} P(A_p(\epsilon))^{1/p}
= 
P(A(\epsilon))^{0}
= 1
\text{.}
$$ Therefore, we have proven that $\liminf_{p \to \infty} \lVert f_p \rVert_p \geq \lVert f \rVert_\infty - \epsilon$ .
Since $\epsilon > 0$ can be taken arbitrarily small, we obtain $\liminf_{p \to \infty} \lVert f_p \rVert_p \geq \lVert f \rVert_\infty$ as desired. Questions So my questions are: Is the proof that I wrote above correct? Are there any other conditions under which we have $
\lim_{p \to \infty} \lVert f_p \rVert_p
=
\lVert f \rVert_\infty
$ ? Are there any counterexamples?","['probability-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis', 'measure-theory']"

Pick $k$ elements of S two times $a_1,\dots,a_k$ , $b_1,\dots b_k\in S$ in such way that: there is a unique way to order the two choices $a_1<\dots<a_k$ and $b_1<\dots<b_k$ , we ask that $a_i\le b_i$ for each $i=1,\dots,k$ . Consider then $a_{k+1}<\dots<a_n$ the remaining
elements in order of $S\setminus\{a_1,\dots,a_k\}$ and $b_{k+1}<\dots<b_n\in S\setminus\{b_1,\dots,b_k\}$ . The claim is that $a_i\ge b_i$ for each $i=k+1,\dots,n$ . For example: $S=\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \},$ so $n=6$ , and let $k=3$ . Pick $(a_1,a_2,a_3)=(1,3,5)$ and $(b_1,b_2,b_3)=(2,5,6)$ . Of course we have $a_i\le b_i$ . Taking the complements we have $(a_4,a_5,a_6)=(2,4,6)$ and $(b_4,b_5,b_6)=(1,3,4)$ and here $a_i\ge b_i$ as wanted. The question is really elementary, but I struggled to write a general proof. My progress is: we can assume in the first choise that each $a_i < b_i$ , otherwise if $a_i = b_i$ we can drop this pair. This implies in the complement that $a_{k+1}>b_{k+1}$ and $a_{n}>b_n$ . I tried to use induction on the index between $k+1$ and $n$ but I can't figure it out how to conclude. Also I tried for contraddiction assuming there is an index such that $a_j\le b_j$ , and taking the smaller of those, but I cannot finish the proof.

and I have also become acquainted with the graph theoretic approach of the same question asked at Number of functions such that $f(f(f(x)))=f(f(x))$ , while solving this problem in a class, our instructor said there must be at least one $(x,x)$ mapping in the function to satisfy the condition given, where $x \in$ { $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ }. He then proceeded to take cases of when there are $1, 2, 3, 4,$ and $5$ respectively of such pairs in our mapping, summing these cases to get $756$ , which is the final answer. What I could not acquaint myself with, nor find an explanation for online was why this statement (at least one $(x,x)$ mapping) is true.

I am thinking of the following question: Suppose $M$ is a compact manifold. Is it true that any locally finitely generated $C^\infty(M)$ submodule of $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ us a finitely generated submodule? If I am not mistaken, this is what is mentioned in some result.

So, there is an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of $M$ such that $P|_{U_\alpha}$ is finitely generated for each $\alpha$ .

Unfortunately, I don't know how to find residues at those points. I can Taylor expand $e^{z^2}-1$ around any point, but since I divide by this, I don't see how it helps (or maybe is there any easy way to find a Laurent expansion of 1/f, when we have a Taylor expansion of f?) As for the second one, I'm totally lost. Usually, when I have an integral over a real axis, I find a suitable contour (semi-circle, keyhole) where the integral vanishes over a semicircle etc. Here, however, the integral is over a finite interval, and the numerator is ""big"", so even if I integrate over a semicircle, I don't think the upper part (over the circle) will vanish (one of my ideas was to substitute $x=u^2$ , look at the integral over whole real axis, since the one I'm interested in should be just a real part of that, and integrate over a semicircle - it will be just using a residue theorem with residue at $\sqrt{3}i$ , but I don't think the integral over semicircle will vanish (not mentioning the problems with a branch of a square root...).

Then find the limit $$\lim_{x\to\infty}(\frac{f(3+\frac 3x)}{f(3)})^x.$$ The thing is, I managed to solve the problem. I will give the detailed steps how I solved it: We observe that $$L=\lim_{x\to\infty}(\frac{f(3+\frac 3x)}{f(3)})^x,$$ is of the form $1^\infty.$ So, we try a popular recommended transformation, as $$L=e^{\lim_{x\to\infty}x(\frac{f(3+\frac 3x)}{f(3)}-1)}\implies e^{\frac 1{f(3)}\lim_{x\to\infty}x(f(3+\frac 3x)-f(3))}.$$ We focus on the limit $\lim_{x\to\infty}x(f(3+\frac 3x)-f(3)).$ We assume $\frac 1x=k$ and as $x\to\infty$ we have, $k\to 0.$ So, $$\lim_{x\to\infty}x(f(3+\frac 3x)-f(3))=\color{green}{\lim_{k\to 0}\frac 1k(f(3+ 3k)-f(3))}\color{blue}{=3\lim_{k\to 0}\frac 1{3k}(f(3+ 3k)-f(3))}.$$ We note that $f'(3)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(3+h)-f(3)}{h}\color{blue}{=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(3+3h)-f(3)}{3h}}=\lim_{k\to 0}\frac{f(3+3k)-f(3)}{3k}$ so, we write, $$\lim_{x\to\infty}x(f(3+\frac 3x)-f(3))=\color{green}{\lim_{k\to 0}\frac 1k(f(3+ 3k)-f(3))}\color{blue}{=3\lim_{k\to 0}\frac 1{3k}(f(3+ 3k)-f(3))}=3f'(3).$$ Hence, $$L=e^{\lim_{x\to\infty}x(\frac{f(3+\frac 3x)}{f(3)}-1)}\implies e^{\frac 1{f(3)}\lim_{x\to\infty}x(f(3+\frac 3x)-f(3))}=e^{\frac{3f'(3)}{f(3)}}=e^{\frac{3f'(3)}{3f'(3)}}=e.$$ I hope my solution is correct.

My understanding: My understanding that of why $$""f'(3)=\lim_{k\to 0}\frac{f(3+k)-f(3)}{k}\color{blue}{=\lim_{k\to 0}\frac{f(3+3k)-f(3)}{3k}}"",$$ is a valid transformation ? We note, here $k\to 0$ and hence $3k\to 0$ and the limit expression i.e $\frac{f(3+k)-f(3)}{k}$ (before transformation), has all the $k's$ approaching to zero, and as $3k$ approaches zero as well, it doesn't really matter if we replace all the $k's$ in $\frac{f(3+k)-f(3)}{k}$ by $3k$ and write, $$f'(3)=\lim_{k\to 0}\frac{f(3+k)-f(3)}{k}\color{blue}{=\lim_{k\to 0}\frac{f(3+3k)-f(3)}{3k}},$$ due to which, $f'(3) $ is invariant due to this transformation. By the same preceding logic, why can't I argue about the correctness of this $$\lim_{x\to\infty}x(f(3+\frac 3x)-f(3))=\color{green}{\lim_{k\to 0}\frac 1k(f(3+ 3k)-f(3))}\color{red}{=\lim_{3k\to 0}\frac 1{3k}(f(3+ 3k)-f(3))}$$ ?","['limits', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"

Some forms of context include: background and motivation, relevant definitions, source, possible strategies, your current progress, why the question is interesting or important, etc. Closed last year . Improve this question Is there a vector algebra/calculus proof of the fact that $\cos^{2} A + \cos^{2} B + \cos^{2} C \geq \frac{3}{4}$ for any triangle $\Delta ABC$ ? I have seen many algebra/trig proofs, but I was wondering if there was a way to prove this using vectors, like the way you prove the law of cosines from expanding $(\vec{u} - \vec{v})^{2}$ ? This is my progress so far: A triangle can be specified by two vectors, $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ ; these form two sides of a triangle (the vertex being at the origin). Then, $\vec{v} - \vec{u}$ forms the other side. Let $u = |\vec{u}|$ and $v = |\vec{v}|$ , and $(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2} = (\vec{v} - \vec{u}) \cdot (\vec{v} - \vec{u}) = u^{2} + v^{2} - 2 \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}$ . If $A$ denotes the angle between $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ at the origin, then $\cos^{2} A = \frac{(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}}{u^{2} v^{2}}$ . Likewise, if $B$ denotes the angle between $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v} - \vec{u}$ , then $\cos^{2} B = \frac{((\vec{v} - \vec{u}) \cdot u)^{2}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}u^{2}} = \frac{(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u} - u^{2})^{2}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2} u^{2}} = \frac{(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u})^{2} - 2u^{2}(\vec{v}\cdot \vec{u})+u^{4}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}u^{2}}$ . If $C$ denotes the angle between $\vec{v} - \vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ , then $\cos^{2} C = \frac{((\vec{v} - \vec{u}) \cdot v)^{2}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}v^{2}} = \frac{(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u} - v^{2})^{2}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2} v^{2}} = \frac{(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u})^{2} - 2v^{2}(\vec{v}\cdot \vec{u})+v^{4}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}v^{2}}$ . Using the common denominator of $(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}u^{2}v^{2}$ , we then have the following: $$\cos^{2}A + \cos^{2} B + \cos^{2} C = \frac{(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}[(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}+u^{2} + v^{2}] - 4(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2}v^{2} +u^{4}v^{2} + u^{2}v^{4}}{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}u^{2}v^{2}}$$ Simplifying the numerator gives: $$\cos^{2} A + \cos^{2} B + \cos^{2} C = \frac{u^{2}v^{2}(u^{2} + v^{2} - 4(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})) + 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}(u^{2} + v^{2} - \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}) }{(\vec{v} - \vec{u})^{2}u^{2}v^{2}}$$ The statement that $\cos^{2} A + \cos^{2} B + \cos^{2} C \geq \frac{3}{4}$ then becomes equivalent to the statement that $$u^{2}v^{2}(u^{2}+v^{2} - 4(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})) + 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})(u^{2} + v^{2} - \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}) \geq \frac{3}{4} (u^{2} + v^{2} - 2 \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2}v^{2}$$ Subtracting the right-hand side from the left-hand side gives: $$\frac{1}{4}u^{2}v^{2}(u^{2} + v^{2} - 10(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})) + 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})(u^{2} + v^{2} - \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}) \geq 0$$ One thought I had to prove this inequality was to rewrite the left-hand side as follows: $$\frac{1}{4}v^{2}(u^{2} - 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}))^{2} + \frac{1}{4}u^{2}(v^{2} - 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}))^{2} + (\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2} - \frac{1}{2}(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2}v^{2} - (\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{3}$$ It would then suffice to show that $ (\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2} - \frac{1}{2}(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2}v^{2} - (\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{3} \geq 0$ or equivalently that $(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}) ((\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})-\frac{1}{2}u^{2}v^{2} -(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}) \geq 0$ . However, if $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $u^{2} = v^{2} = 1$ (angle $A$ is $30^{\circ}$ ), then $(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} - \frac{1}{2}u^{2}v^{2}-(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})) = \frac{1}{8}(6- 5\sqrt{3}) < 0$ . Is there another way to rewrite $$\frac{1}{4}u^{2}v^{2}(u^{2} + v^{2} - 10(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})) + 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})(u^{2} + v^{2} - \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})$$ as a linear combination of $(u^{2} - 2\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}$ and $(v^{2} - 2\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}$ (with coefficients that are all nonnegative?) Note that the equality case should imply that $A = B = C = 60^{\circ}$ , which should be equivalent, in this context, to $u^{2} = 2 \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}$ and $v^{2} = 2\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}$ . $A = 60^{\circ} \iff u^{2}v^{2}=4(u \cdot v)^{2}$ ; $B = 60^{\circ} \iff (\vec{u} - \vec{v})^{2}u^{2} = 4(\vec{u} \cdot (\vec{v} - \vec{u}))^{2} \iff u^{4} + u^{2}v^{2} - 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2} = 4u^{4} + 4(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}- 8(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2} \iff 3u^{4}  - 6(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})u^{2}  = 0 \iff u^{2} = 2 u \cdot v$$ $C= 60^{\circ} \iff (\vec{u} - \vec{v})^{2}v^{2} = 4(\vec{u} \cdot (\vec{v} - \vec{u}))^{2} \iff v^{4} + u^{2}v^{2} - 2(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})v^{2} = 4v^{4} + 4(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})^{2}- 8(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})v^{2} \iff 3v^{4}  - 6(\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v})v^{2}  = 0 \iff v^{2} = 2 \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}$ )","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry', 'vector-analysis']"
4696629,Proximal operator of squared $\ell_1$-norm,"For any $a \in \mathbb R^d$ and $t \ge 0$ , let $p_t(a)$ be the unique minimizer of $f_t(x;a) := \|x-a\|_2^2 + t\|x\|_1^2$ over $x \in \mathbb R^d$ . Question. Is there an analytic formula for $p_t(a)$ ? Observation 1. By the subdifferential characterization of prox-operators, we know that $p_t(a) = (1+t\partial f)^{-1}(a)$ , where $\partial f$ is the subdifferential operator of $f$ . Thus, if $R := \|p_t(a)\|_1$ , then $p_t(a)$ satisfies $p_t(a) = (1+Rt\partial \|\cdot\|_1)^{-1}a = \mbox{prox}_{Rt\|\cdot\|_1}(a)$ , i.e the components of $p_t(a)$ are given by $$
(p_t(a))_j = \mathrm{ST}(a_j;Rt),
\tag{1}
\label{1}
$$ Here, $\mathrm{ST}(u;\lambda)$ is the well-known soft-thresholding operator defined by $$
\mathrm{ST}(u;\lambda) :=
\mbox{sign}(u)(|u| - \lambda)_+.
$$ However, the issue is that $R$ is unknown, since it depends on the sought-for $p_t(a)$ . Observation 2. From \eqref{1}, we deduce that: if $Rt \ge \|a\|_\infty := \max_j |a_j|$ , then $p_t(a) = 0$ . Thus, we may assume $Rt \le \|a\|_\infty$ . We may therefore search for $p_t(a)$ in form \eqref{1} with $Rt$ restricted to the compact interval $[0,\|a\|_\infty]$ . This is one-dimensional problem! Unfortunately, it's still not a closed-form solution...","['convex-optimization', 'proximal-operators', 'linear-algebra', 'signal-processing', 'convex-analysis']"
4696630,Does the distance induced from a Riemannian metric on a manifold determine the Riemannian structure?,"Let $(M, g), (N,h)$ be Riemannian manifolds and consider $d_g$ and $d_h$ the corresponding distance functions induced from $g$ and $h$ . Suppose $f: M \rightarrow N$ is a bijective isometry in the metric sense i.e. $d_h(f(x), f(y)) = d_g(x,y)$ . Is it true that $f$ must be smooth and, moreover, that $f^* h = g$ ? In more generality, if $M$ and $N$ are only smooth manifolds and $d_M, d_N$ are smooth distance functions, is it true that a bijective isometry $f: M \rightarrow N$ must be smooth?","['riemannian-geometry', 'metric-spaces', 'smooth-manifolds', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
4696639,relations between obstructions coming from Moore-Postnikov towers,"Roughly speaking, I am interested in understanding what (if any) relationships there are between certain obstructions to constructing sections of a bundle of the form $$
P\times_G G/H\to M
$$ where $M$ is a (compact) manifold, $G$ is a (compact) Lie group with Lie subgroup $H$ and $P\to M$ is a principal $G$ -bundle. More precisely, I know there is an associated universal bundle $$
EG\times_G G/H\to BG
$$ where $EG\to BG$ is the bundle that classifies principal $G$ bundles. I also know that the bundle above admits a Moore-Postnikov tower $\{Z_i\}_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ such that $Z_{n+1}\to Z_n$ comes from pulling back the fibration $PK_n\to K_n$ (here $K_n=K(\pi_n(G/H),n+1)$ and $PK_n$ is the corresponding path space) by a map $Z_n\to K_n$ . Such a map gives rise to a cohomology class $o_{n+1}\in H^{n+1}(Z_n,\pi_n(G/H))$ , which give obstructions to lifting constructing a section of $EG\times_G G/H\to BG$ over the various skelta of $BG$ . There is a similar Moore-Postnikov tower $\{W_i\}_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ for the fibration $$EG\to BG$$ that gives rise to similar obstruction classes $\tilde o_{n+1}\in H^{n+1}(W_n,\pi_n(G))$ . Since $EG$ is contractible, I believe that some people might call this a Whitehead tower. At least that is what I believe from looking at the wikipedia page for Postnikov towers . We have a commutative diagram of fibrations $$\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
EG @>>> BG;\\
@VVV @VVV \\
EG\times_G G/H @>>> BG;
\end{CD}$$ where the right hand vertical map is the identity and the other three maps are the other maps are the obvious bundle projections. According to this post , the Moore-Postnikov towers have nice naturality properties and so this diagram should induce maps $\Phi_n:W_n\to Z_n$ . There are also maps $\Psi_n:K(\pi_n(G),n+1)\to K(\pi_n(G/H),n+1)$ , induced by the natural projection $G\to G/H$ . My naive expectation is that the following maps should fit together in a new commutative diagram (possibly just up to homotopy) of the form $$\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
W_n @>>> K(\pi_n(G),n+1);\\
@V{\Phi_n}VV @V{\Psi_n}VV \\
Z_n @>>> K(\pi_n(G/H),n+1);
\end{CD}$$ where the horizontal maps are the ones giving rise to $o_{n+1}$ and $\tilde o_{n+1}$ above. I further naively believe that if $\alpha:H^{n+1}(W_n,\pi_n(G))\to H^{n+1}(W_n,\pi_n(G/H))$ is the map coming from ""changing coefficients"" then $\alpha(\tilde o_{n+1})=\Phi^\ast_{n}(o_{n+1})\in H^{n+1}(W_n,\pi_n(G/H))$ . Given all of the above, I have a few questions Is all of the above true? If not, is it true with some minor modifications? If it is true, can anyone provide a proof or a good reference? I have a feeling that if it is true it is not that hard to show and that the reason I can't do it is that I only know that Moore-Postnikov towers exist and have various  nice properties, but don't really know how they are constructed. FYI: my background is in differential geometry and less in algebraic topology. My understanding of classifying space and Postnikov towers is coming from reading Hatcher's Algebraic topology book over the last several days. For context, I really want to understand the obstructions $o_n$ , but they seem complicated. On the other hand the obstructions $\tilde o_n$ appear to be more tractable (at least in small dimensions where they are related to classical characteristic classes, e.g. Stiefel-Whitney/Pontryagin classes).","['principal-bundles', 'fiber-bundles', 'obstruction-theory', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
