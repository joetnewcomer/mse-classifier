360747,Prove that $\tan(75^\circ) = 2 + \sqrt{3}$,My (very simple) question to a friend was how do I prove the following using basic trig principles: $\tan75^\circ = 2 + \sqrt{3}$ He gave this proof (via a text message!) $1. \tan75^\circ$ $2. = \tan(60^\circ + (30/2)^\circ)$ $3. = (\tan60^\circ + \tan(30/2)^\circ) / (1 - \tan60^\circ \tan(30/2)^\circ) $ $4. \tan (30/2)^\circ = \dfrac{(1 - \cos30^\circ)}{ \sin30^\circ}$ Can this be explained more succinctly as I'm new to trigonometry and a little lost after (2.) ?

360790,Classifying groups of order 90.,"Since $3\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 5=90$, we know that we have a $3$-Sylow subgroup $P_3$ of order $9$, a $2$-sylow subgroup $P_2$ of order $2$, a $ 5$-Sylow subgroup $P_5$ of order $5$. I know that $P_5 \cong Z_5$ and $P_2 \cong Z_2$, right? But I'm not sure what $P_3$ is isomorphic to, because we cannot necessarily conclude that it is cyclic...since it might have $4$ different elements of order $3$. So when I'm looking at the different cases for the semidirect products (for example if I look at the case when all of the sylow subgroups are normal), I will just say $G \cong P_3 \times Z_{10}$, right?

360795,Generalization of Banach's fixed point theorem,"I wanted to show that if $f:X\to X$ is a function from a complete metric space to itself and if $f^k$ is a contraction, then $f$ has a unique fixed point (say $p$) and for any $x$ in $X$ $f^n(x)\longrightarrow p$. What I did is use what I know from Banach as follows:
Take $x$ arbitrary in $X$.
Then consider the sequence $f^n(x)$, which I denote by $x_n$.
Let $x^{(i)}$ be the sequence $x_i, x_{i+k}, x_{i+2k}...$ for $i$ between 0 and $k - 1$.
As $f^k$ is a contraction, we can apply Banach and so it has a fixed point (say $l$) and all the $x^{(i)}$ are convergent to $l$. Then $x_n$ is convergent to $l$ (for any $\epsilon$ exists $N$ such that $d_X(x_n, l) < \epsilon$, this $N$ being the maximum of the corresponding N's obtained from each of the $x^{(i)}$). Since $x$ was arbitrary and $l$ is unique, this means that $p=l$ and the proof is completed. Am I doing something wrong or missing anything? I just want to ensure I understand this properly, this is not a homework or something similar. Thank you!","['general-topology', 'fixed-point-theorems']"
360807,derivative with respect to constant.,"I have been beating my head against this question for quite some time, I do not know whether it has been asked before, but I can't find any information about it! I am taking Calculus 1 course and I cannot grasp the concept of a derivative. From what I understand, a derivative is a function with the following signature: $$(\text{derivative with respect to particular free variable}) :: (\lambda x \to (f)\; x) \to (\lambda x \to (f') x)$$ also phrased as $$(\text{derivative with respect to particular free variable}) = ((\lambda x \to (f) x) \to (\lambda x \to (f') x))$$ e.g: $$(\text{derivative with respect to x}) (\lambda x \to x^2) = (\lambda x\to 2\cdot x)$$ This makes sense but one thing bothers me: what does ""derivative with respect to x"" mean? 
In particular, in single variable Calculus this notation assumes $x$ is always a particular variable such as ['a'..'z'] . This works fine for basic derivatives such as:
$$(\text{derivative with respect to x}) (\lambda x \to \ln x) = (\lambda x \to \tfrac{1}{x})$$ What I would like to understand is: Why does (derivative with respect to x) make sense
but 
$(\text{derivative with respect to} (\lambda x \to 2))$ and $(\text{derivative with respect to} (\lambda x \to \ln(x)) $
do not seem to make any sense to me. in classical terms, I cannot do (derivative of $\ln x$ with respect to $1$) nor (derivative of $\ln x$ with respect to $\ln x$) without my head starting to hurt, because those concepts were not taught to me yet, or I have not payed enough attention to understand them. Can somebody please explain what the following two really mean? Derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to a constant such as $1,2,3,\ldots 9999$ Derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to a function such as $\ln(x)$, $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$ Thanks ahead of time, this has been bothering me for quite a few years! $\langle$Editor's note: I've left the following in the post for archival's sake.$\rangle$ PS: I am terrible at formatting so to the great ones responsible for

  make sense to me since derivatives are taught to be polymorphic
  function rather than a function of two variables, and division only

360816,About the proof that a simple group of order 60 is isomorphic to A5,"I am stuck proving that a simple group $G$ of order $60$ is isomorphic to $A_5$.

I could further show $|Syl_2(G)|\notin\{1,3\}$. Now, where I get stuck: I need to show $|Syl_2(G)|\neq15$ and therefore $|Syl_2(G)|=5$.
I know I have to use the fact that there are already $20+24=44$ elements of order coprime to $2$. That leaves only $60-44-1=15$ elements to have order 2 or 4, which somehow has to lead to a contradiction to $|Syl_2(G)|=15$. But the 2-Sylow-groups have order $2^2$ and can thus intersect non-trivially. So how can I argue from here?

360832,Proving that a critical point is a minimum,"I am solving a problem, which is ""Find the point of the paraboloid $P:=\{(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^3 | x^2+y^2=z\}$ which is the nearest to the point $(1,1,\frac12)$."" I have already determined (using the Lagrange multipliers method) that $p=(2^{-\frac23},2^{-\frac23},2^{-\frac13})$ is a critical point of $f(x,y,z)=(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-\frac12)^2$ (which is the square of the distance function) with the restraint $g(x,y,z)=0$, where $g(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2-z$. I need some help in order to prove that $p$ is the minimum of $f|_P$. If possible, give me only a hint, as it is homework and I only want some idea to finish the problem by myself. EDIT: As requested, I'm showing my calculations so far. A critical point of $f|_P$ is, by the Lagrange multipliers method, one which satisfies $g(x,y,z)=0$ (that is, $x^2+y^2=z$) and $\nabla f(x,y,z)=\lambda \nabla g(x,y,z)$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. We have $\nabla f(x,y,z)=(2x-2,2y-2,2z-1)$ and $\nabla g(x,y,z)= (2x,2y,-1)$, which yields the system
$$(2x-2=\lambda 2x)\wedge(2y-2=\lambda 2y)\wedge(2z-1=-\lambda),$$
which is equivalent to
$$(x=\tfrac{1}{1-\lambda})\wedge (y=\tfrac{1}{1-\lambda}) \wedge(z=\tfrac{1-\lambda}{2}).$$ So we get $x=y$ and $2x^2=z$ (because $x^2+y^2=z$), which gives $\frac{2}{(1-\lambda)^2}=\frac{1-\lambda}{2}$, that is, $\lambda = 1-2^\frac23$. This gives us $x=y=2^{-\frac23}$ and $z=2^{-\frac13}$.",['multivariable-calculus']

In fact, I can prove that $T(X/G) \simeq (TX)/G$, for a suitable action of $G$ on $TX$. My question here is motivated by trying to understand the tangent space of $\mathbb CP^n$. It can be seen as $S^{2n+1}/U(1)$, but here, the action of $U(1)$ is not properly discontinuous, and everything breaks down. $U(1)$ acts on $TS^{2n+1} \simeq \{ (x,v) : x,v \in \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \|x\| = 1, x \bot v \}$ (orthogonality is for the real inner product on $\mathbb{R}^{2n+2} = \mathbb C^{n+1}$) by multiplication on both factors.

361217,Are these two definitions of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ over a ruled surface closely related?,"All varieties are assumed over $\mathbb{C}$. Consider a geometrically ruled surface $X$ over a curve $C$, it is known that $X$ can be realized as the projective bundle associated to a rank $2$ vector bundle $E$ over $C$, that is $X=\mathbb{P}(E)$. But there are two ways to associate a projective space $\mathbb{P}(V)$ to a vector space $V$: $\mathbb{P}_l(V)$ consists of lines in $V$; $\mathbb{P}_h(V)$ consists of hyperplanes in $V$ (all passing through $0$). These two projective spaces are dual to each other but not isomorphic naturally. (This is the problem!) Hartshorne uses $\mathbb{P}_h(E)$, since he defined it by $\textrm{Proj }S(E)$; while Beauville uses $\mathbb{P}_l(E)$. It is obviously true that $\mathbb{P}_h(E)=\mathbb{P}_l(E^*)$, we denote it by $X$. Let $\pi:X\rightarrow C$ be the projection map. The difference comes from the definitions of $O_X(1)$ over $X$. Hartshorne defines it using $\textrm{Proj}$ construction, so $O_l(1)$ is a natural quotient of $\pi^*E$; while Beauville defines it using the exact sequence $0\rightarrow N\rightarrow \pi^*E^*\rightarrow O_h(1)\rightarrow 0$, here $N$ is the natural line bundle over $X=\mathbb{P}_l(E^*)$. Question : Are these two definitions closely related? When $E$ is decomposable, I prove that $O_h(1)\cong O_l(1)\otimes \pi^*(\wedge^2E^*)$, but I cannot prove it in general.

My thoughts were something like $K/\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, where $t$ is transcendental over $\mathbb{F}_p$, and $K$ is the splitting field of $g(x)=x^p-t$. I know that $g$ is irreducible and not separable (it has a repeated root $s\in K$, $g(x)=x^p-t=x^p-s^p=(x-s)^p$), and if I could show that $g$ was the minimal polynomial of $s$ over $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ then I think I'd be done ($K/F$ is Galois if and only if for every $\alpha\in K$, the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$ is separable and $K$ contains its splitting field).

As the limit is $0$, we can remove the modulus, so we get: $$\lim_{y\rightarrow x} \frac{f(x) - f(y)} {x-y} = 0$$
So $f$ is derivable and $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$.
Note that the reason we can add the limit $y\rightarrow x$ is because $[a,b]$ is closed in $\mathbb R$. However, the question gives as a hint using the mean value theorem.

For example when $n=m$ it seems numerically that $S \sim 1.841 n$ and in fact if $n=m$ then it is suggested that $S \sim n\left(2-\left( -W\left(-\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}^2}\right)\right)\right)$ (see Is $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{2n-k} \binom{n}{k} \sim\frac{n^{2n}}{2\pi} $? ). Update 2. When $m=1$ then $S$ is precisely the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday.  This is solved at the wikipedia entry for the Birthday Problem and so $S \sim \sqrt{\frac{\pi n}{2}}$ (which equals  my guess above).  I would however ideally like to find the asymptotics in terms of $m$ and $n$ without assuming that $m$ is fixed. Update 3. For the $m=1$ case we can prove that the correct asymptotics is $\sqrt{\frac{\pi n}{2}}$ in two ways. We will first show the result using the following identity. $$n  + 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^{k-1} \binom{n}{k} \frac{(n-k)^{n+1-k}}{n^{n+1-1}}=1 + \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{n!}{(n-k)!n^k} = 1+Q(n)$$ The numerator of the sum on the left is $n^{n+1}-Q(n)n^n$ (Q(n) is called Ramanujan's function by Knuth) according to A219706 and A063169 .  This immediately gives the identity. We also know that $Q(n) \sim \sqrt{\frac{\pi n}{2}}$ from the wikipedia (is there a better reference?). The second proof follows from the amazing answer of GEdgar where he shows that $$\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} k^{k-1}(n-k)^{n-k+1} =
	n^n\Bigg( n
	-\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{2} n^{1/2} + \frac{1}{3}
	-\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{24} n^{-1/2}
	+\frac{4}{135}n^{-1}
	-\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{576}n^{-3/2}

Here ""angle-preserving"" means that the linear map $T$ satisfies $$\frac{ \langle x, y \rangle}{\|x\| \|y\|} = \frac{ \langle T(x), T(y) \rangle}{\|T(x)\| \|T(y)\|},$$
and that $T$ is injective. My first problem with this question is that the claim is false. Taking $n = 2$, $x_1 = (1, 0)$, $x_2 = (1,1)$, $T(x_1) = -x_1$, $T(x_2) = x_2$, and setting $x = x_1$, $y = x_1 + x_2$, the expression in the RHS above evaluates to $0$, while the expression in the LHS evaluates to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

So basically what this problem is saying is that there's a canonical way to define a metric on the countable product of metric spaces.  I showed in a previous problem that the topology induced by $\rho_n$ is equivalent to that induced by $\frac{\rho_n(x_n,y_n)}{1+\rho_n(x_n,y_n)}$.  And thus we can go ahead and just assume that $\rho_n< 1$ for all $n$ and replace our infinite series by $$\rho(x,y)=\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\rho_n(x_n,y_n)}{2^n}.$$ Now comes the interesting part: how should I go about showing that the product topology on $X$ and the topology induced by $\rho$ are equivalent? The basis for the product topology given to me in my book's definition is that of cartesian products made up the $X_n$ except for finitely many which are $O_n$ for some open subset of $X_n$.  However I believe I was able to improve upon this and show that I could decompose these into a basis where the $O_n$ were all open balls induced by their respect $\rho_n$ metric. For $\rho$ I'm using the basis of open balls that it induces, as I can see no other reasonable choice. However I can't seem to match these two bases up.  There are many different points $\{x_n\}\in X$ which make my infinite series less than a certain value and there is so much freedom in which terms in the series I choose to reduce in size that it seems hopeless to try and fit an open ball induced by $\rho$ into any one of my basis elements for the product topology. Is there a more appropriate strategy for proving these two topologies are equivalent?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'real-analysis', 'product-space']"

It could be ${\binom{17+23-1}{23}} + {\binom{19}{2}}$ but I dont think that is quite right. ${\binom{17+23-1}{23}}*19*18$ could maybe be a possibility? I think this number is larger than the original though so that can't be right.","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

361885,Counting 1:1 and onto functions,"I'm faced with the following questions: 1) How many functions are there from a set of size 3 to a set of size 5? How many of them are 1-to-1? 2) How many functions are there from a set of size 10 to a set of size 2? How many of them are onto? Attempt: 1) To determine the the number of functions, we can set $A = \{a,b,c\} = a$ and $B = \{d, e, f, g, h\} = b$. So the number of functions is $b^a$ or $5^3$. However, this is a large figure for me to do each one by paper and pencil to determine how many are 1:1.

361894,Block Matrices of Operators,"I'm trying to prove the following: Consider the vector space of matrices of size $n\times n$ whose entries in $\mathcal B(H)$. Denote this vector space by $M_{n,n}(\mathcal{B(H)})$. We can define involution on $M_{n,n}(\mathcal{B(H)})$ by 
$$
T^*=[T_{ij}]^*=[T_{ji}^*],\qquad\text{where}\quad T=[T_{ij}]\in M_{n,n}(\mathcal{B(H)}).
$$
Thus we have an involutive algebra $M_{n,n}(\mathcal{B(H)})$. I want to prove that there exist a norm on $M_{n,n}(\mathcal{B(H)})$ which makes it a $C^*$-algebra. First I try to prove that there exists a $*$ isomorphism between $M_{n,n}(\mathcal{B(H)})$ and $\mathcal{B}\left(\bigoplus\limits_{k=1}^n\mathcal H\right)$. So I define the following map: 
$$J:M_{n,n}(\mathcal{A})\to\mathcal{B}\left(\bigoplus\limits_{k=1}^n H\right):[T_{ij}]\mapsto\left((x_1,.....,x_n)\mapsto\left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^n(T_{1j})x_j,\ldots,\sum\limits_{j=1}^n(T_{nj})x_j\right)\right)
$$ I proved that this map is $1-1$. My question is : is it onto ? or does it have a closed range? Also , to prove that $J([T_{ij}]^*)= J([T_{ji}^*])=J^*([T_{ij}]))$. I did the following using the definition of the adjoint operator, but I'm not sure where things go wrong: I take $x=(x_1,......,x_n), y=(y_1,.....,y_n)\in \bigoplus\limits_{k=1}^n H $, then $$\begin{align}(J(T)^*x)(y)= x(J(T)y)&= x(\sum\limits_{j=1}^n(T_{1j})y_j,....,\sum\limits_{j=1}^n(T_{nj})y_j)\\& = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left [x_i(\sum\limits_{j=1}^n(T_{1j})y_j,....,\sum\limits_{j=1}^n(T_{nj})y_j)\right] \\&=\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n (T_{ij}y_j)(x_i)\\&=\sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n (y_j)(T^*_{ij}(x_i))

361902,Evaluating a double integral involving exponential of trigonometric functions,"I am having trouble evaluating the following double integral: $$\int\limits_0^\pi\int\limits_0^{2\pi}\exp\left[a\sin\theta\cos\psi+b\sin\theta\sin\psi+c\cos\theta\right]\sin\theta d\theta\, d\psi$$ I will be satisfied with an answer involving special functions (e.g. modified Bessel function). I tried expanding the product terms using the product-to-sum identities, as well applied other trigonometric identities , to no avail.  Can anyone help? I suspect that the solution will involve a modified Bessel function $I_n(x)$ with argument in the form $\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$.  The reason I think so is because the above integral is related to a likelihood function used in evaluation of a non-coherent detection of signals that are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (for example, see Proakis ""Digital Communications"" 4th Edition pp. 304-306). However, these signals are in the two-dimensional domain (they are complex numbers) and the corresponding integral is as follows: $\int_{0}^{2\pi}\exp[a\sin\theta+b\cos\theta]d\theta=2\pi I_0(\sqrt{a^2+b^2})$.  The double integral that I am trying to evaluate is the extension of this problem to a three-dimensional space, with the corresponding change from polar to spherical coordinate system .","['definite-integrals', 'trigonometry', 'exponential-function', 'integration']"
