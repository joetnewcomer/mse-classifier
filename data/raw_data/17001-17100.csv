139307,Set operations in the constructions of the Weak Topology cannot be reversed,"Let $X$ be a generic set and let $(Y_i)_i$ be a family of topological spaces. Let $(\varphi_i)_i$ be a collection of functions of the kind $X \to Y_i$. It is possible to determine a topology (that would be the coarser) in which all those functions are continuous, as follows: 1) if $\omega_i$ is an open set from some of the $Y_i$, then $\varphi_i^{-1}(\omega_i)$ is necessarily an open set (because we are supposing the functions to be continuous). So we can obtain a family $U$ of subsets in $X$ given by these pre-images. 2) We can consider finite intersections of members from $U$ obtaining a space $\phi$ that includes $U$ and that is stable under finite intersections. $\phi$ may not be stable for arbitrary unions. 3) Then we can consider the family $\mathcal{F}$ obtained by forming arbitrary unions of elements from $\phi$. It can be proven that $\mathcal{F}$ is stable under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. The process of taking finite intersections first and then arbitrary unions cannot be reversed because we can obtain a family of subsets that is not stable under arbitrary unions. Do you know some concrete examples showing why the ""reverse"" construction fails?","['general-topology', 'functional-analysis']"
139334,$\coprod_{i \in I} (Y \times X_{i})$ and $Y \times \coprod_{i \in I}X_{i}$ are homeomorphic,"To prove that $\coprod_{i \in I} (Y \times X_{i})$ and $Y \times \coprod_{i \in I}X_{i}$ are homeomorphic, I constructed
$h: \coprod_{i \in I} (Y \times X_{i}) \rightarrow Y \times \coprod_{i \in I}X_{i}: ((y,x),i) \longmapsto (y,(x,i)).$ Now it is clear without any proof that $h$ is bijective. To prove that $h$ is continuous I did the following: $A \subseteq Y \times \coprod X_{i}$ is open $\iff A = B \times C, B \subseteq Y $ open, $C \subseteq  \coprod X_{i}$ open $\iff A = B \times C, B \subseteq Y$ open, $C \cap X_{i}$ open in $X_{i}, \forall i \in I$. To prove that $h^{-1}(A)$ is open in $\coprod Y \times X_{i}$, we must show that $A \cap (Y \times X_{i})$ is open in $Y \times X_{i}, \forall i \in I$.
Now we have $A \cap (Y \times X_{i}) = (B \times C) \cap (Y \times X_{i}) = (B \cap Y) \times (C \cap X_{i}) = B \times (C \cap X_{i})$, where the first component is open in $Y$ and the second in $X_{i}$ because of the previous facts. Is this reasoning correct? For the second part of the prove, we must show that $h^{-1}$ is continuous, or, equivalent, that $h$ is open. Therefore I take $A \subseteq \coprod (Y  \times X_{i})$ open. This means that $\forall i \in I: A \cap (Y \times X_{i})$ open in $Y \times X_{i}$. So write $A = E \times F$, to prove that $h(A)$ is open in $Y \times \coprod X_{i}$ we must show that $ E \cap Y$ is open in $Y$ (which is already the case) and that $\forall i \in I F\cap X_{i}$ is open in $X_{i}$ (which is also true). Is this second reasoning also correct? If not, where do I go wrong? As always, thanks for the help!",['general-topology']

139495,A compact Lie group has descending chain condition on closed subgroups.,"Proposition: Let $G$ be a compact Lie group and let $$G\supset G_1\supset G_2\supset\ldots$$ be a chain of closed subgroups $G_i$ of $G$. Then this chain must eventually stabilize. Question: The hint for the proof is that $G_i$ are closed manifolds and if $G_{i+1}\neq G_i$, either $\dim G_{i+1}<\dim G_i$ or $G_{i+1}$ has fewer connected components than $G_i$. I understand first part since closed subgroup of compact Lie group is subgroup that is also (embedded) submanifold, but I don't understand second part of the hint, ie. if $G_{i+1}\neq G_i$, either $\dim G_{i+1}<\dim G_i$ or $G_{i+1}$ has fewer connected components than $G_i$. Can you please help me with that? And I believe the rest of the proof is (please correct me if i'm wrong or if I missed something): Since dimensions are finite they must stabilize, ie. there exist $n_0$ such that $\dim G_{n_0}=\dim G_{i}=\dim G_{i+1}=\ldots=constant$ But then (from the hint) the number of components of  $G_{i+1}$ $<$ number of components of $G_i$ $<$ number of components of $G_{n_0}$. Since $G_{n_0}$
 is closed in $G$ it is compact and therefore has a finite number of connected components (since compact and locally-connected topological space has at most finitely many connected components). So it follows that eventually these number must also stabilize and proposition is true. Thank you!","['general-topology', 'topological-groups', 'lie-groups']"

A\cos(2\omega t+\beta_1)+B\cos(3\omega t+\beta_2)+C\cos(5\omega t+\beta_3)

Since each part is at a different frequency, i cannot sum the magnitudes of each part. I have also thought about using variations of the double/triple angle formulae and some basic trigonometric identities, so that I can write the equation under a single frequency, but by doing so, I am introducing some higher order terms, which seem to negate the ability to sum the amplitudes together. For example, the term with $5\omega$ would look like
$$16\cos^5(\omega t)-20\cos^3(\omega t)+5\cos(\omega t)$$ I suppose another method would be to plot the first equation and then record the amplitude, but i would like a more generalised approach to solve this problem.  All input is welcome and appreciated.","['trigonometry', 'harmonic-analysis']"

Although the paper treats it as such, it is not obvious to me why we have the restriction (x mod 15, y mod 30), or how f and g are picked - he says in the description of the algorithm: Given positive integers $\delta < 60$, $f \le 15$, and $g \le 30$ such that $\delta \equiv 4f^2 + g^2$ (mod 60), ... Does this mean that we can simply pick one particular pair (f, g) for which the congruence holds, or if more than one pair exists does one need to enumerate over all pairs in order to generate all triples (x, y, k)?","['linear-algebra', 'algorithms', 'number-theory']"

It is a few lines to show the $(\Rightarrow)$ direction, but I'm really stuck on the $(\Leftarrow)$ direction.  In fact, I'm actually not able to find the difference between a sequential space (one where sequentially closed subsets are closed) and a Frechet space (one where the sequential closure of subsets coincides with the topological closure). It seems that the definitions are the same if $sc(sc(A)) = sc(A)$ for all subsets $A$ of some topological space.  I can't prove this fact, but cannot come up with a counter-example either. Of course Frechet implies sequential: If $A\subset X$ is sequentially closed, then $sc(A) = A$ .  Since $X$ is Frechet, $sc(A) = \overline{A}$ .

I'm really bad at geometry problems and when I came across ones like this, I don't even know what should I try to do and end up gazing at the picture and being unable to find anything useful... Edit one day later: OK, I'm trying my best to beat it and here's what I have: Let $\angle AXB=2\alpha$, then $\angle ADB = \alpha$. Similarly $\angle ASB=2\beta$ and $\angle ACB = \beta$. $|AS|=|SB|=R$ where R is the radius of the circle circumscribed on $\triangle ABC$. Then, $\triangle ASB$ is isosceless. Also $|AX|=|BX|=r$ where r is the radius of the circle circumscribed on $\triangle ADB$ so $\triangle ADB$ is isosceless as well. And here I get stuck. We know that we have both isosceless triangles but I can't find a way to show that R=r which would prove all the sides being even. The ""mutual"" angle for both circles is $\angle ADB$ so I suppose I should use it. However, I don't think I can put it to use within the circle circumscribed on $\triangle ABC$ as its vertex doesn't lie on the circle. I thought about the law of sines but $\frac{|AB|}{\sin \alpha}=R$ and $\frac{|AB|}{\sin \beta}=r$ don't look promising. Could you give me a hint on how to move on? Edit again: I believe I got it! Firstly, let's note something regarding what I wrote above and clarify: $\angle AXB=2\alpha$ so the reentrant angle $\angle AXB'=360^\circ-2\alpha$. Then, $\angle ADB=180^\circ-\alpha$. Then, Let E be the foot of the altitude from B to $|AC|$ and let F be the foot of the altitude from A to $|BC|$. Let's have a look at AFDE quadrilateral. $\angle CEF=\angle CFD=90^\circ$. $\angle ECF = \angle ACB = \beta$ Then $\angle EDF=360^\circ - 90^\circ-90^\circ-\beta = 180^\circ-\beta$. $\angle EDF = \angle ADB$ so $\alpha = \beta$. Hence $\frac{|AB|}{\sin \alpha}=\frac{|AB|}{\sin \beta}=R=r$. All the sides are then equal and $|SX|$ is a perpendicular bisector of $|AB|$ so $ASBX$ is a rhomb q.e.d.","['geometry', 'triangles', 'euclidean-geometry']"

In the first place, one can easily show that $||x_{n+1}||^2=\langle x_{n+1},x_n\rangle$, from which one easily deduces that the sequence of norms is decreasing, so that $\lVert x_n\rVert\to\ell\geq 0$. Then one can also show that if $V\cap W=\{0\}$ and a subsequemce $\{x_{2n_k}\}_k$ converges weakly to some $x$, then the sequence $\{x_{2n_k+1}\}_k$ also converges weakly to $x$, whence $x=0$.

For this, I first note that $$\lVert x_n\rVert^2=\langle x_{n+1},x_{n-2}\rangle=\cdots=\langle x_{2n-1},x_0\rangle$$ And now I would like to use that the sequence of norms converges and Riesz's representation theorem to conclude weak convergence but I am unsure as to how to proceed, since while it is true that any functional in $H$ is of the for $\langle \cdot,x_0\rangle$, varying $x_0$ also varies the sequence $\{x_{2n-1}\}$.

For instance, when we are calculating the surface area, we would denote $T_s\triangle s$ and $T_t\triangle t$ as the vector which is spanning a paralleogram to approximate the rectangle $ \triangle s \times \triangle t$ where $T_s =\frac{\partial F}{\partial s} $ and F is the surface. In lagrange multiplier, we know f has extremum point if $\nabla f= \lambda\nabla g$, from this expression, we know the grandient f should be perpendicular to the level set g, where it is the domain of f. From the proof, the idea is if $\nabla f $ is not parallel to $\nabla g$ then there is change in f, but here come the question, why if $\nabla f $ is not parallel to

Show that $2\notin G_P(|K|)$ if and only if $X$ is hyperelliptic and $P$ is a ramification point.

Technically, $G_P(|K|)$ is the set of gap numbers. I have shown the if part fine. The other direction I think is true because there will be two points in the preimage of the projection to $\mathbb P^1$ if $P$ is not ramified. Hence, I want to say that if there is a pole at $P$, there will be a pole at the other point in the preimage.

139906,Is it possible to find radical solution of $\sin(5\beta)+\sin(\beta)=1$  and finding radical approximation of $\pi$,"ABCD is a unit square. There are 2 circles in picture. The center of one is A and passing from F. The center of another is D and passing from C. If $\alpha=2\beta$ then
I got the following results $|AF|=x$ $\cos(2\beta)=\frac{1}{x}$ and from isoscale triangle (ADG): 
$\sin(3\beta)=\frac{x}{2}$ $\sin(3\beta)\cos(2\beta)=\frac{1}{2}$ $\sin(5\beta)+\sin(\beta)=1$ $\sin(\beta)=P$ my first question: Is it possible to find a solution of P via radicals? Second question:
During my drawing the figure that Area of (CGH region) is equal about Area of (HBF region) (just I noticed with  geometrical drawing tool).I do not claim that they are equal Because I know very well that it is impossible to Squaring a circle .(more info is in Wiki link) I try to find approximation of $\pi$ in radicals via the figure if possible.
Note:If you know interesting $\pi$ approximations via Squaring a circle, I would like to know them.
Thanks for advices and answers EDIT: I asked the question to wolfram alpha . I got fifth degree polinom with real coefficients. $\sin(5\beta)+\sin(\beta)=1$ $\sin^5(\beta)+5\sin(\beta)\cos^4(\beta)-10\sin^3(\beta)\cos^2(\beta)+\sin(\beta)=1$ $\sin^5(\beta)+5\sin(\beta)(1-\sin^2(\beta))^2-10\sin^3(\beta)(1-\sin^2(\beta))+\sin(\beta)=1$ $\sin(\beta)=P$ $16P^5-20P^3+6P=1$ Really $P=\sin(\pi /6)=\frac{1}{2}$ is a solution of the polinom. All roots are in the link . What a pity that wolfram did not offer me radical solutions for 4 degree polinom either. I will check other tools to find radical solutions of the roots.
For my second question  UPDATE: I decided to see if really Areas are about eqaul to each other. the  root is for my first drawing: I will take the solution about $P\approx0.188286$ from wolfram solution. $\sin(\beta)\approx0.188286$ $\beta\approx0.189416$ $|AF|=x$ $\cos(2\beta)=\frac{1}{x}$ $x=\frac{1}{\cos(2\beta)}\approx1.076314$ Area of (CGH region)=  ( wiki link ) Area of (HBF region)=  ( Wiki Link ) RESULT: I wonder if I use more digits of the root what Areas will be.
it seems that numerical solution of areas are very near each other.
I will update if I find radical solution of polinom and I will update if I find some other results.
Your helps will be appreciated very much to analyze the results. Thanks a lot to Chris K. Caldwel for his contribution.

139972,Parametric equations for elliptical orbits,"(Editing because I left out the actual question part. Oops!) Given a situation like a comet going round the sun in an elliptical orbit, what would parametric equations for the comet's path look like? It'd be extra rad if it was expressed in terms of polar coordinates with the sun(one of the foci) at the origin. Even just pointers on a better way to approach the problem would be cool. Here's how I approached it but it didn't get me to a solution: The acceleration at any point is
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
F &=& \frac{Gm_{sun}m_{comet}}{r^2} \\
r &=& \|\vec{x}\|\\
\vec{a} &=& -\frac{F}{m_{comet}}\frac{\vec{x}}{\|\vec{x}\|}\\
&=& \frac{Gm_{sun}}{\|\vec{x}\|^2}\frac{\vec{x}}{\|\vec{x}\|} \\
&=& \frac{Gm_{sun}\vec{x}}{\|\vec{x}\|^3}\\
\end{eqnarray*}$$
and of course acceleration is the second derivative of the position, so
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{x} &=& \iint \frac{Gm_{sun}\vec{x}}{\|\vec{x}\|^3} dt\,dt\\
&=& Gm_{sun}\iint \frac{\vec{x}}{\|\vec{x}\|^3} dt\,dt
\end{eqnarray*}$$
but I have no idea what do with integrating a norm like that, so breaking the vector down:
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{x} &=& \left \langle x,y \right \rangle \\
\vec{a} &=& \left \langle x'',y'' \right \rangle \\
\|\vec{x}\| &=& \left ( x^2+y^2 \right )^\frac{1}{2} \\
\|\vec{x}\|^3 &=& \left ( x^2+y^2 \right )^\frac{3}{2} \\
\frac{1}{\|\vec{x}\|^3} &=& \left ( x^2+y^2 \right )^{-\frac{3}{2}} \\
\left \langle x'',y'' \right \rangle&=& Gm_{sun} \left \langle \frac{x}{\|\vec{x}\|^3}, \frac{y}{\|\vec{x}\|^3} \right \rangle\\
\left \langle x'',y'' \right \rangle&=& Gm_{sun} \left \langle x\left ( x^2+y^2 \right )^{-\frac{3}{2}}, y\left ( x^2+y^2 \right )^{-\frac{3}{2}} \right \rangle
\end{eqnarray*}$$
which gives me a system of differential equations I could write like 
$$\begin{eqnarray*}
{\partial^2\over\partial t^2} x(t) &=& Gm_{sun}x(t)\left ( x(t)^2+y(t)^2 \right )^{-\frac{3}{2}} \\
{\partial^2\over\partial t^2} y(t) &=& Gm_{sun}y(t)\left ( x(t)^2+y(t)^2 \right )^{-\frac{3}{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}$$

Since $N\cap Z(G)$ is normal in $Z(G)$, in both cases ($N\cap Z(G)=\{1\}$ and $N\cap Z(G)\neq\{ 1\}$), I used the Second Group Isomorphisms Theorem to get: $G/N\cong Z(G)/N\cap Z(G)$ so $|G/N| = |Z(G)/N\cap Z(G)|$ Since N is normal in G, $|G/N|=p^{n-m}$, with $n-m>0$.

140080,Is this action of $\mathbb F[[x]]$ on $\bigoplus_{i=0}^{\infty}\mathbb F$ natural?,"The title of my question has a field $\mathbb F$ in it, but to make sure I'm not losing anything, I would like to introduce my question in full generality. But still, I will be happy with an answer in fields, which is why I chose this title. Please feel free to consider $R$ a field and all modules to be vector spaces. Notation I'm assuming $\mathbb N=\{0,1,\ldots\}$ in this question. Let $R$ be any unital ring. $R[x]$ denotes the ring of polynomials over $R$. $R[[x]]$ denotes the ring of formal power series over $R$. (The linked article requires that $R$ be commutative. I don't.) $M_n(R)$ will denote the ring of all square matrices over $R$ indexed by the set $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\times\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}.$ $M_{\infty}(R)$ denotes the set of all $\mathbb N\times\mathbb N$-matrices over $R$ whose columns have finitely many non-zero coefficients. This restriction allows the usual multiplication of such matrices, and so they form a ring. I will also be using the ring of endomorphisms $E(R)$ of the free $R$-module $V(R)=\bigoplus_{i=0}^{\infty}R,$ with a fixed basis $e_0,e_1,\ldots$ Background The rings $M_\infty (R)$ and $E(R)$ are isomorphic. Just like for finite matrices over fields, the $i$-th column of a matrix $A$ represents the element $y$ of $V(R)$ to which $e_i$ is mapped by a corresponding endomorphisms $\alpha.$ To be precise, the column contains the coefficients of $y$ in the basis $e_0,e_1,\ldots$ This explains the requirement that there be only finitely many non-zero elements in the columns, because every $y\in V(R)$ can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the basis, and linear combinations are finite sums. Let now $\phi:R[[x]]\longrightarrow M_\infty(R)$ such that $$\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_ix^i\mapsto 
\begin{pmatrix}
a_0    & a_1    & a_2    & a_3    & \ldots\\
0      & a_0    & a_1    & a_2    & \ldots\\

0      & 0      & 0      & a_0    & \ldots\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{pmatrix}
$$ $\phi$ is a ring isomorpisms onto its image $M_\triangledown(R).$ I found it very interesting that formal power series (and therefore also polynomials) can be embedded in matrices. It turns out to be useful. I'm reading a 1974 paper by Jan Krempa which uses it. The title is On the Jacobson Radical of Polynomial rings . Very similarly, we can define the map $\psi:R[x]/\langle x^n\rangle\longrightarrow M_n(R)$ such that $$
\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ix^i\right)+\langle x^n\rangle\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
a_0    & a_1    & a_2    & \ldots & a_{n-1}\\

0      & 0      & a_0    & \ldots & a_{n-3}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
0      & 0      & 0      & \ldots & a_0
\end{pmatrix}$$ Question Let $f=\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_ix^i\in R[[x]].$ Now $\phi(f)$ is a matrix over $R$ and as such can be identified with an endomorphism $\alpha_f$ of $V(R).$ As an endomorphism, $\alpha_f$ can take arguments from $V(R)$ and send them to some other elements of $V(R).$ However, the original power series $f$ is not usually thought to have such a capability. We can define for any $f\in R[[x]]$ and $y\in V(R)$ $$fy:=\alpha_f(y).$$ I would like to know if thinking of formal power series acting in this way on $V(R)$ is natural. I was trying to see some natural way in which a power series can be thought of as an endomorphism of a free module or vector space but I failed. It's easy to write what $fy$ actually is. Let $y\neq 0$ for simplicity. Let $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ be the coefficients of $y$ in the basis $e_0,e_1,\ldots$ Let $n$ be the greatest index such that $y_n=0$ but $y_{n-1}\neq 0$. Now calculating $fy$ is essentially the same as calculating $$
\begin{pmatrix}
a_0    & a_1    & a_2    & \ldots & a_{n-1} & \ldots\\
0      & a_0    & a_1    & \ldots & a_{n-2} & \ldots\\

140102,How to invert this function on matrices which involves the permanent?,"I'm interested in understanding whether a particular natural function on matrices, closely related to the permanent of a matrix, is invertible, and whether its inverse admits a simple closed form. The function $f$ I'm concerned with maps  doubly stochastic $n \times n$ matrices to doubly stochastic $n \times n$  matrices, and is given by the following expression. $ f_{ij}(A) = \frac{A_{ij} \  perm(\tilde{A}_{ij})}{perm(A)} $ where $perm$ denotes the permanent function, and $\tilde{A}_{ij}$ denotes the $(i,j)$'th minor of $A$ --- i.e. the matrix gotten by removing the i'th row and j'th column of $A$. Observe that, by the row [column] expansion formula for the permanent, $f(A)$ is doubly stochastic whenever A is doubly stochastic. Also observe that $f$ is continuous, and each entry of $f(A)$ is the ratio of two multilinear functions of the entries of $A$. I have three questions: (a) Is $f$ invertible? If not, does $f$ at least have a right inverse, and is there such a right inverse that is continuous? (b) If $f$ has an inverse, is there a simple closed form for $f^{-1}$? Otherwise, if $f$ has a continuous right-inverse, is there a simple closed form for this right inverse? (c) If $f$ has an inverse (or continuous right-inverse), but the answer to (b) is no, can the inverse at least be (approximately) computed by a simple, preferably efficient (polynomial-time in n) procedure?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'permanent', 'multilinear-algebra', 'combinatorics']"

It is about (global) complete intersection in $\textbf P^n$. For those without Hartshorne' book at hand, I describe the problem: $Y$ is a closed subscheme of $\textbf P^n$ of codimension $r<n$.
I assume that $Y$, as a scheme, is the same as $H_1\cap\dots\cap H_r$, where $H_i=V_+(f_i)$ are hypersurfaces. I have to show that $Y$ is a complete intersection (that is, its homogeneous ideal $I(Y)$ can be generated by $r$ elements). Well, I know that the ring $S=k[x_0,\dots,x_n]$ is Cohen-Macauley, so we have the unmixedness theorem in $S$. That is, whenever an ideal $J\subset S$ of codimension $q$ can be generated by $q$ elements, it is unmixed: it shares its own height with all of its associated primes - the elements of $\textrm{Ass}_S(S/J)$. Thus what I can say (?) is \begin{equation}
r=\textrm{ht}\,(f_1,\dots,f_r)=\textrm{ht}\,I(Y)
\end{equation} and hence $L:=(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ is unmixed. So if $\mathfrak p$ is an associated (necessarily minimal) prime for $L$ then $\textrm{ht}\,\mathfrak p=r$.

140123,"How do different definitions of ""degree"" coincide?","I've recently read about a number of different notions of ""degree.""  Reading over Javier Álvarez' excellent answer for the thousandth time finally prompted me to ask this question: How exactly do the following three notions of ""degree"" coincide? (1) Algebraic Topology. Let $f\colon X \to Y$ be a continuous map between compact connected oriented $n$-manifolds. Wikipedia tells me that $H_n(X) \cong H_n(Y) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, and that a choice of orientations for $X$ and $Y$ amount to choices of generators $[X], [Y]$ for $H_n(X), H_n(Y)$, respectively.  We then define $\deg f$ via $$f_*([X]) = (\deg f)[Y].$$ (2) Differential Topology. Let $f\colon X \to Y$ be a smooth map between oriented $n$-manifolds, where $X$ is compact and $Y$ is connected. Let $y \in Y$ be a regular value of $f$ (which exists by Sard's Theorem), let $D_xf\colon T_xX \to T_yY$ denote the derivative (a.k.a. pushforward), and define $$(\deg f)_y = \sum_{x \in f^{-1}(y)}\text{sgn}(\det D_xf).$$
It can be shown that $(\deg f)_y$ is independent of the choice of $y \in Y$, so we can talk meaningfully about a single quantity $\deg f = (\deg f)_y$. (3) Riemann Surfaces. Let $f\colon X \to Y$ be a holomorphic map between compact connected Riemann surfaces. For $x \in X$, we let $\text{mult}_x(f)$ denote the multiplicity of $f$ at $x \in X$.  For $y \in Y$, we define $$(\deg f)_y = \sum_{x \in f^{-1}(y)} \text{mult}_x(f).$$
As in (2), it can be shown that $(\deg f)_y$ is independent of the choice of $y \in Y$.  (Does this generalize to arbitrary complex manifolds?) Thoughts: As was mentioned in my topology class last semester (and also on Wikipedia), there is this concept of ""local homology"" which lets us compute (1) as a sum of ""local degrees."" I imagine that in the case of (2), each of these local degrees is, in fact, equal to $\text{sgn}(\det D_xf)$ because $f$ is a local diffeomorphism at each regular point $x$.  I also imagine that in the case of (3), each of these local degrees is, in fact, equal to $\text{mult}_x(f)$ because the degree of $\mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{S}^n$, $z \mapsto z^k$ is $k$.  (Does this also mean that $f$ is not regular at any point where $\text{mult}(f) \geq 2$?  This would make sense, but what is the proof?) This all seems correct in my head, but I would really like more details if possible.","['differential-topology', 'riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"

Well, certainly is converges for all $x$ if $V$ is a Hilbert space. But what if $V$ is not a Hilbert space? Is the completeness property that a Hilbert space possesses necessary to ensure the Fourier series converges in $V$ for all $x\in V$? Might there be incomplete inner product space $V$, e.g. maybe $c_{00}$ - sequences in $\mathbb{F}$ with finitely many non-zero entries, along with associated inner product $\langle(a_n),(b_n)\rangle = \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty a_n \overline{b_n}$. Then we choose the obviously countable orthonormal basis. Isn't it true that for each $x$ the Fourier series converges? If this is the case then what can we say about such inner product space whose Fourier series of $x$ converges to any given $x$ in the space, assuming the space is not a Hilbert space, i.e. not complete? Is the point that these spaces are arbitrary and the completeness property will guarantee us Fourier convergence? Perhaps Hilbert spaces are, in turn, easier to deal with in general because they guarantee us nice properties. Also (more basic question), can we always find an ONB of a well-defined inner product space? Edit : I just realized Gram-Schmidt does this for us in all Hilbert spaces.

I've started by just looking at the product $$\frac{n!\,\,n^z}{z(z+1)\cdots(z+n)}\cdot\frac{n!\,\,n^{z+1/2}}{(z+1/2)(z+3/2)\cdots(z+(2n+1)/2)}$$ and the numerator very nicely becomes $(n!\, n^{2z})(n!\,n^{1/2})$, so we have the beginning stages of $\Gamma(2z)$ and $\Gamma(1/2)=\sqrt{\pi}$. But the denominator is killing me! Any advice? Also, where in the world does this $2^{2z-1}$ come from? Thanks!","['gamma-function', 'special-functions', 'complex-analysis']"
140180,A scalar product in the space of oriented volumes?,"Let $L\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^N$ be an injective linear map. By the Cauchy-Binet formula, $\det(L^TL)$ equals the sum of the squares of all minors of $L$ of order $n$: this looks just like a norm. Also, the square root of this number has a geometrical interpretation as the scale factor by which $L$ maps $n$-volumes, which makes Grassmann's exterior product come into mind. Question If we let $\Lambda^n(\mathbb{R}^N)$ denote the vector space spanned by $n$-vectors $$v_1\wedge \ldots \wedge v_n,\qquad v_j \in \mathbb{R}^N, $$ does there exist a scalar product $\langle ,\rangle$ on it such that 
  $$\det(L^TL)=\langle Le_1\wedge \ldots \wedge Le_n, Le_1\wedge \ldots \wedge Le_n\rangle ?^{(\star)}$$ If the answer is affirmative, is this scalar product geometrically related to the concept of 
  ""oriented $n$-volume in $\mathbb{R}^N$""? And finally, is it possible to
  generalize all this to an arbitrary Riemannian manifold? Bibliographical references as answers are fine. Thank you. (*) $e_1\ldots e_n$ denotes the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$.","['linear-algebra', 'riemannian-geometry', 'reference-request', 'euclidean-geometry', 'exterior-algebra']"
140184,Expected Ratio of Coin Flips,"If you flip a coin until you decide to stop and you want to maximize
  the ratio of heads to total flips, what is that expected ratio?

you flip again if there are more tails than heads you flip again if you have more heads then tails you don't flip How do you put this into an equation form to solve for expected ratio? Thanks","['recreational-mathematics', 'probability', 'problem-solving']"

140232,P.D.F. of independent/dependent Uniform R.V.'s,"I am trying to solve this: Consider a stick of length 1.  You break the stick in two
  random places, X and Y. a. Define the individual
  probability distribution functions of the breaking points X and Y. b. Write the joint PDF of the breaking points, if X and Y are
  independent.  Sketch its  support (domain) and indicate the density
  values of this domain. c. Assume that Y is such that $Y > X$. What is the joint PDF of $(X,Y)$ if it needs to be  uniform on this domain. Again, sketch its support and indicate the density value. d. The two breaking points divide the stick in three segments. 
  What is the probability of the left-most segment is the shortest
  segment, when $Y > X$?  Sketch the area in the $X-Y$  plane that
  corresponds to this event.  (Hint: to be the shortest segment the
  leftmost segment  needs to satisfy two constraints simultaneously.) Solutions: a/b) $$PDF(X,Y) = 1 | (x,y) \in [0,1]\times [0,1]$$$$0|otherwise$$ c) we know that $X$~U$(0,1)$. The clause that $Y\gt X$ means that $Y$~U$(X, 1)$. Now, Y has become dependent on X, correct? Therefore, the joint PDF isn't as simple as multiplying the PDF's together. How do I get the joint PDF in this case? The answer I was given is that $$PDF(X,Y) = 2|(X,Y)\in [0,1]\times [0,1] \cap (Y > X)$$ but I'm having trouble understanding why this is... I think I understand the concept that, because $Y>X$, the area in which Y can live is halved, because, when X is chosen (since it is chosen uniformly), Y's value depends on the value of X, and the uniform distribution means that the area Y can occupy is halved. but, why does the P.D.F. = 2 in this case? Wouldn't it still be equal to 1, as in: $$PDF(X,Y) = 1|(X,Y)\in [0,1]\times [0,1] \cap (Y > X)$$ I thought the only change would be in the are for which the PDF was valid (hence the distribution needing to intersect the area where $Y>X$ d) For this one, I came up with 3 constraints: $\frac{1}{2} <Y<\frac{3}{4}$ and $X<\frac{1}{4}$ thus, $X$~U$(0,\frac{1}{4} )$ and $Y$~U$(\frac{1}{2} , \frac{3}{4})$ making $$PDF(X) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}} = 4$$and $$PDF(Y)= \frac{1}{\frac{3}{4} -\frac{1}{2}} = 4$$ so joint $PDF(X,Y) = 16|\frac{1}{2} <Y<\frac{3}{4}$ and $X<\frac{1}{4}$ However, this is incorrect, and I can't rightly figure out why.

My argument is that there are 23 choose 2 ways times $\displaystyle \frac{1}{365^{2}}$ for 2 people to share the same birthday. But, we also have to consider the case involving 21 people who don't share the same birthday. This is just 365 permute 21 times $\displaystyle \frac{1}{365^{21}}$.

140261,Factorial canceling on expansion of binomial coefficients on Concrete Mathematics,"On Concrete Mathematics section 5.5, which is teaching the hypergeometric functions, generalized factorials is defined as: \[
\frac 1 {z!} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \binom{n+z}{n}n^{-z}
\] where \[
\binom r k =
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
r^{\underline k} / k! = r(r-1) \cdots (r-k+1) / k! & k > 0 \\
1 & k = 0 \\
0 & k < 0
\end{array}
\right.
\] follows the ordinary definition. So $z! = z(z-1)!$ for all complex $z$ (except negative integers), then we can check $0! = 1$ and $n! = n(n-1) \cdots 1$ for $n > 0$. Then, a binomial coefficient can be written \[
\binom z w = \lim_{\zeta \to z} \lim_{\omega \to w} \frac{\zeta!}{\omega!(\zeta-\omega)!}
\] Let $t_k = \dbinom r k \dbinom s {n-k}$. However, the succeeding paragraph says that \[ t_k = \frac{r!}{(r-k)!k!} \frac{s!}{(s-n+k)!(n-k)!}\]
  and we are no longer too shy to use generalized factorials in these expressions. without limits (it is said that we must use appropriate limiting values when these formulas give $\infty / \infty$) and considers the ratio $t_{k+1} / t_k$ for all $t_k \neq 0$ and cancels some factorials using the property $z! = z(z-1)!$ I'm ""too shy"" and my question remains: why can we do such canceling? To observe closely, we take a variety of an example from section 5.7: Considering indefinite summation
 \[
 \sum \binom n {-k} \delta k, \qquad n < 0
 \] Let $t(k) = \dbinom n {-k} = \dfrac{n!}{(-k)!(n+k)!}$, we have
 \[
 \frac{t(k+1)}{t(k)} = \frac{n!}{(-k-1)!(n+k+1)!} \frac{(-k)!(n+k)!}{n!} = -\frac{k}{n+k+1}
 \] Let $n = -1$, we have $t(k+1) / t(k) = -1$ for $t(k) \neq 0$. But it's wrong for $k = 0$, where $t(1) = 0$ and $t(0) = 1$. To see how the error happens, we resume the $\lim$ notation: \begin{align*}
 t(k+1)
  &= \binom n {-k-1} \\
  &= \lim_{z_2 \to 0} \lim_{z_1 \to 0} \frac{(n+z_2)!}{(-k-1+z_1)!(n+k+1-z_1+z_2)!} \\
  &= \lim_{z_2 \to 0} \lim_{z_1 \to 0} \frac{-k+z_1}{n+k+1-z_1+z_2} \frac{(n+z_2)!}{(-k+z_1)!(n+k-z_1+z_2)!} \\
  &= \binom n {-k} \lim_{z_2 \to 0} \lim_{z_1 \to 0} \frac{-k+z_1}{n+k+1-z_1+z_2} 
 \end{align*}
 So when $n = -1$ and $k = 0$, we have $\lim_{z_2 \to 0} \lim_{z_1 \to 0} (-k+z_1)/(n+k+1-z_1+z_2) = 0$ not $-k/(n+k+1)$. Another example (also from section 5.5) is: \[
  \lim_{x \to -1} \frac{x!}{(x-1)!} = \lim_{x \to -1} x = -1
 \]
 but
 \[
  \lim_{x \to -1} \frac{x!}{(2x)!} = -2
 \]
 because of $(-z)! \Gamma(z) = \pi / \sin(z\pi)$, so expression $(-2)! / (-1)!$ is illegal. My question is: in the frame of Concrete Mathematics , how to prevent such errors? Thanks a lot.","['factorial', 'discrete-mathematics', 'binomial-coefficients', 'limits']"
