36834,Can someone explain the math behind tessellation?,"Tessellation is fascinating to me, and I've always been amazed by the drawings of M.C.Escher, particularly interesting to me, is how he would've gone about calculating tessellating shapes. In my spare time, I'm playing a lot with a series of patterns which use a hexagonal grid, and a tessellating design I saw on a chair in my dentist's surgery. Here's some examples of patterns I've worked up... Because I don't really understand the math, I've had to create the basic unit shape by hand, I can see the 60/120 degree angles well enough, but I really want to figure out the proportions of the shape, which appear (from just looking) to be tightly interrelated. A few observations I've made during this process (aside from it being a bit more tricky than I first imagined.) There appears to be a equilateral triangle which contains the key dimensions, and of course the regular hexagon is important, since this essentially forms 2 interwoven hexagonal grids. Beyond this I'm unable to express mathematically what is going on. Key things I'd like to learn are... How to calculate the relative positions of each shape to build the grid programmatically. How to construct the shape unit mathematically. I know that this doesn't help too much in understanding less rigid tessellation designs, such as Escher's reptiles, which I assume MCE made intuitively (I read that he wasn't a mathematician, which I was surprised by.) Anyway, I hope this question isn't too sprawling, and thank you for looking. Additional notes on the origin of this pattern. Previously I'd said, (I believe the pattern is pretty old and of Chinese origin.) . However, this statement was pure speculation based on the appearance of similar patterns in Chinese art, also using the p31m wallpaper tiling method, this one below for example.. Well, it turns out that this specific pattern: Appears originally in Islamic / Arabic / Moorish art. Within the confines of my limited research, it seems that geometric designs in Islamic art hold no specific religious significance (I expect this is a highly controversial statement.) and instead provide an opportunity for craftsmen to demonstrate the skill and subtlety of their workmanship, and to dazzle and intrigue the viewer with their complexity. It seems that using circle construction of a grid of equilateral triangles, this pattern can be discovered, along with numerous variations, eg: After working with this and other Islamic patterns I find that this not only appeals  to the viewer but as much to the artist. Every time I begin working with these patterns I'm constantly amazed by them. Apparently Keith Critchlow an artist, lecturer, author, and professor of architecture, has made extensive studies in Islamic architecture, arts and decoration, and I've ordered a couple of books written by him, Order in Space and Islamic Patterns: An Analytical and Cosmological Approach , to further my own education on this topic. (I should note that Critchlow received high praise from Buckminster Fuller, who commented on his genius. Personally, as a long time acolyte of Fuller, I'm very intrigued to see Professor Critchlow's books.) New York Metropolitan Museum of Art provides this PDF book for free download... Animated Construction Hexagonal Tessellation Construction (draft) from ocodo on Vimeo . Click the image to watch... Update So I discovered through pencil/compass construction that the base unit is 1/8th of the radius of the initial construction circle (i.e. the length of one side of the hexagon.) The width of the struts are 1/4 (or 2 base units) I'm pushed for time to get this done tonight so I'm just posting progress as I work things out... (and noting where I make mistakes) Construction: Here is the construction mapped to the the 31m wallpaper group... (handily iPhone4 wallpaper sized... well, the link through is.) Gallery. I've added a Flickr set to post various designs on the hexagonal lattice theme, take a look. Interactive pattern generators I've made some processing sketches which you might like to see, they generate patterns like this... and this... (They have some keyboard controls to tame the randomness a bit.) 3D / Blender experiments. I have these shapes being 3D printed, I'll post a report when I get them in the mail (will be about 10 days) (I used Shapeways.com who print 3D objects in plastic, metal and other assorted materials.) The intention with this set of 7 is to assemble them, and frame them nicely. I also get to test the precision of the 3D print material. 3D prints arrive. Due to my inexperience with solid manufacture, I completely overlooked the need to allow for manufacturing/material tolerance. After a brief study on this aspect I'm remodelling my figures to add this in. However I need to fabricate a few sets to test optimal tolerance. Anyway, this is what I've got back from shapeways, (nb: they use UPS shipping, included in the cost and the items are packaged very well, there is no risk of breakage.) When I get the tolerance right I'll post again. By the way, I found a very cool feature in CARMetal, (the software I've used to do the geometric construction.) I can add controls like sliders and text inputs that affect dimensions. For example, I create a slider t (tolerance) and can then apply t to the radius of my tolerance circles, which I use subsequently to construct the line segments which make up the adjusted shape, these all stay in sync with the slider value. It's probably easier to see it, the tolerance is marked green (way too much in this example.) Hand sanded Clay tiles... Well, not actually clay, I've used Sculpey, and pressed the tiles out using these tile cutters, which were 3D printed by Shapeways. Additional notes... (These are mostly for my reference, I'm summarising, but please feel free to correct me where I've gone wrong, it would be a big help.) In addition to the p31m symmetry, there's an interesting relationship within the shape dimensions. The struts are of course all of equal width, and obviously all the angles are multiples of $60^\circ$ . I've noted before, that the strut width is one quarter of the construction radius ( $w = \frac{r}{4}$ or as shown below, $2u$ .) To calculate all required measurements we need to use the base unit $u = \frac{r}{8}$ . The distance between the centres of each shape is $9u$ . The length of a edge of the exterior arrow head (and of course it's corresponding interior edge) is $5u$ . The remaining dimensions are the interior 
lengths of the arrow head, which are both $2u$ (of course, these interlock with each other.) Another minor update I found some interesting information in this article (and page 2 ) on Islamic art. I also took a photo of the chair in my dentists surgery, which began this little study of mine.","['geometry', 'tessellations']"

However, could someone explain to me why this is invalid for $x>1$? What is invalid about $(1-2)^{-1}$ i.e. $-\frac{1}{1} = -1$? Thanks! Edit: Also take the next question. I incorrectly guessed it would be valid for all x greater than or equal to 0, as you can take the square root of any positive number greater than 0.

36956,Calculating mean and standard deviation of very large sample sizes,"I have about 3.5GB worth of data that I need to get statistics from, all split up into about 71MB files, with an (approximately) equal number of samples.  From this data, I would like to gather mean and standard deviation.  Parsing the entirety of the standard deviation is probably a bad idea, since it's 3.5GB. However, I know that with mean, I can at least (with some accuracy, since they're approximately the same size), take the average for each file, and then take the average of each of those sub-averages. With standard deviation, it's a little more tricky, though.  I've taken some time to run tests and found out that the standard deviation of a large sample size seems to be approximately similar to the average of the standard deviations of equivalently sized smaller chunks of samples.  Does this actually hold true, or was that just a coincidence within the few tests that I've run?  If it does hold true, then can I calculate what my percent error is probably going to be?  Finally, is there a more accurate way to test for standard deviation that doesn't require me mulling over 3.5GB of data at a time?","['statistics', 'standard-deviation']"
36960,Help to find cubics with square discriminant,"If the discriminant $b^2-4c$ of the quadratic $x^2 + bx + c$ is a square then it factors. For every discriminant $d^2$ we have can parametrize them all $(b,c) = (d + 2 h,h(d+h))$. edit I realized now that the quadratic case is trivial because it the discriminant is a square iff it factors, so the two variable parametrization is $(x-a)(x-b)$ so it might not represent what is happening with the cubic. I was hoping to do a similar parametrization for the cubics $x^3 - ax + b$ with square discriminant $4a^3 - 27b^2 = d^2$ but factoring in the Eisenstein integers does not seem to make the problem any easier. Are there any other promising approaches I could try? I noticed the problem is simple when $d=0$. In that case we have $a = 3 m^2$, $b = 2 m^3$. Also when $d = b$ we also get a simple parametrization, $a = 7m^2$, $b = 7m^3$ but I don't think these will help to get the general case.","['diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"

37031,Formula to assign weights to expert reviewers based on ratio between total votes and helpful votes,"I'm working on a computer program but I need help coming up with a formula. This program has list of customers that wrote reviews for products. For each review written by this customers there is a number of votes and also a number indicating how many of these votes marked the review as helpful (think of Amazon). And I would like to come up with a shorter list of expert reviewers. The way I envisioned my solution was to assign weights to each customers based on the votes given to the reviews, so I thought a ratio between the number of votes and number of those votes marked as ""helpful"" could be meaningful. However, I ran into instances in which one reviewer had 1 vote and that one vote was marked as helpful, thus the ratio = 1/1 =1 And there are some other instances in which a customer had 19 votes and all of those votes were marked as helpful. that is 19/19 = 1 It's evident that mathematically they are similar; however I would like to assign a bigger weight to the customer who got 19 votes versus only 1. Similarly, I believe a review that got 24 helpful votes out of 25 (24/25 = .96) should have a bigger weight than the customer who got 1 vote which was marked as helpful. Do you have any thoughts on how I could come up with a formula that takes into consideration the ratio and also the number of reviews? Thank you!",['functions']

37045,De Morgan's law on infinite unions and intersections,"While going through Probability: Theory and Examples by Rick Durrett (4th edition, p.9), I came across the familiar definition of $\sigma$-algebras where, if $A_i \in \mathcal{F}$ is a countable sequence of sets for some $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ and $\cup_i A_i \in \mathcal{F}$ by definition, then it follows that $\cap_i A_i^C \in \mathcal{F}$ by de Morgan's law. That's when it occurred to me that I had never seen a proof that de Morgan's law holds over a countably infinite number of sets. I don't have my measure theory/probably theory books with me right now, but I'm quite sure that I've never seen any of them prove this before extending $\sigma$-algebras to countable union or intersection, depending on which definition it started with. On the one hand, it seems obvious that it would hold. On the other hand, seeming obvious is not a proof, especially when it comes to something involving infinity. I can imagine an inductive proof where I assume de Morgan's law holds for an index set of size $n$ Then prove that it holds for an index set of size $n+1$ and wrap it up by $n \rightarrow \infty$ but I'm not convinced that's right.

37151,"Showing any countable, dense, linear ordering is isomorphic to a subset of $\mathbb{Q}$","I'm trying to knock out a few of the later exercises from Enderton's Elements of Set Theory. This problem is #17, found on page 227. A partial ordering $R$ is said to be dense iff whenever $xRz$, then $xRy$ and $yRz$ for some $y$. Assume $(A,R)$ is a linearly ordered structure with $A$ countable and $R$ dense. Show that $(A,R)$ is isomorphic to $(B,<_Q)$ for some subset $B$ of $\mathbb{Q}$. I had an idea, but I'm not sure how to communicate it formally, so I'm hoping to get some help on this. First, since $A$ is countable, I can list it as a sequence, $A=\{a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots\}$, even if this isn't the actual linear ordering dictated by $R$. The text suggests that I define some order isomorphism $f$ by defining $f(a_i)$ by recursion on $i$. I began by letting $f(a_0)=q_0$ for some arbitrary rational. I then look at $a_1$, if $a_0Ra_1$, I would then let $q_0<f(a_1)$, and if $a_1Ra_0$, I instead choose $f(a_1)<q_0$. This continues, so for example, if $a_2Ra_1\land a_0Ra_2$, I would then want to choose $f(a_2)$ such that $q_0<f(a_2)<q_1$ and so on. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense, I just want to choose some rational to preserve the order as I go along sequentially in $A$, and figure out the order as I go. Is this right? If so, what's the rigorous way to state this idea? I'm particularly concerned about how $f$ can respond to where the next element $a_{i+1}$ might be in relation to the previous $a_0,\ldots, a_i$, and how to decide which element to pick out.

When x is less than 0, there's no problem as obviously the function is infinitely differentiable.  Similarly, when x is greater than zero the function is infinitely differentiable, by the properties of the exponential function.  As I see it, the difficulty arises in what happens right at 0.  For the function to be differentiable there, the function needs to be continuous at 0, and for that to happen both the right hand and left hand limits need to equal 0.  So for the function to be infinitely differentiable, one would need to show that in the limit the function $e^{-1/x}$, and all its derivatives, go to zero as x goes to 0. Am I on the right track?

The first distribution is to put a station in A, another at distance $L/2$ from $A$ and the third in $B$. The second distribution is to put the stations at distance $L/4$, $L/2$ and $3L/4$. Clearly the second distribution is better. However, the reference (from which I took the exercise) admits that the second distribution is not optimal!

37277,Extending a convolution operator from $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d;L^q(\Omega))$,"Let $1<p,q<\infty$ and $\Omega$ some $\sigma$-finite measure space. Let $T$ denote a bounded convolution operator on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with scalar valued kernel $K$ which is locally integrable on $\mathbb{R}^d\setminus\{0\}$. Define the associated $L^q(\Omega)$-valued extension $\vec{T}$ via $$(\vec{T}u)(x,\cdot)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}K(x-y)u(y,\cdot)dy$$ for sufficiently well-behaved $u\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^d;L^q(\Omega))$.
Analogously, one can define a Banach space valued extension of $T$ for any Banach space $X$ via $$(\vec{T}u)(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}K(x-y)u(y)dy$$ for well-behaved $u\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^d;X)$.
I'm looking for sufficient conditions for the $L^q(\Omega)$-valued extension $\vec{T}$ to extend to a continuous operator on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d;L^q(\Omega))$. The cases $q=p$ and $q=2$ work without any assumptions on $T$ besides continuity on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ by Fubini and Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund, respectively. The case $q$ between $2$ and $p$ then follows by interpolation. Not taking the convolution structure into account, that's the best one can get in general. If $K$ is in fact in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ then $\vec{T}$ is continuous for any $p,q\in[1,\infty]$ by Young's inequality. This actually works for any Banach space valued extension of $T$, but $K\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is quite restrictive. If $K$ satisfies a Hörmander condition, then $\vec{T}$ is continuous for any $p,q\in (1,\infty)$ and again this actually works for any Banach space valued extension of $T$, provided $\vec{T}$ is continuous on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d;X)$ for some $p\in (1,\infty)$. Now the above conditions either exploit the structure of $L^q(\Omega)$ without exploiting the structure of $T$, i.e. that $T$ is a bounded convolution operator or they rely mainly on the structure of $T$ without taking the structure of $L^q(\Omega)$ into account. This leaves me with the vague feeling that one might be able to do better, i.e. that there are conditions on the convolution kernel $K$ which are less restrictive than the Hörmander condition or at least different but which still ensure that one can extend the bounded operator $T$ on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to a bounded operator $\vec{T}$ on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d;L^q(\Omega))$ for any $q\in (1,\infty)$. Any ideas or references would be highly appreciated.
Of course the same holds true for counterexamples illustrating that one cannot do (significantly) better, if such counterexamples exist. In fact, I even wonder whether there is an example of a convolution operator which is bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $1<p<\infty$ but does not admit a bounded extension to $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d;L^q(\Omega))$ for every $q\in(1,\infty)$.","['harmonic-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"

The proof I am referring to is taken verbatim from the English Wikipedia: Given an $x^{**} \in B_{X^{**}}$, a tuple $(\phi_1, \dots, \phi_n)$ of linearly independent elements of $X^*$ and a $\delta>0$ we shall find an $x \in (1+\delta) B_{X}$ such that $\phi_i(x)=x^{**}(\phi_i)$ for every $i=1,\dots,n$.

If the requirement $||x|| \leq 1+\delta$ is dropped, the existence of such an $x$ follows from the surjectivity of $\Phi : X \to \mathbb{C}^{n}, x \mapsto (\phi_1(x), \dots, \phi_n(x)).$

Let now $Y = \cap_{i} \ker \phi_i = \ker \Phi$.
Every element of $x+Y \cap (1+\delta) B_{X}$ has the required property, so that it suffices to show that the latter set is not empty.

Assume that it is empty. Then $\mathrm{dist}(x,Y) \geq 1+\delta$ and by the Hahn-Banach theorem there exists a linear form $\phi \in X^*$ such that $\phi|_{Y}=0$, $\phi(x) \geq 1+\delta$ and $||\phi||_{X^*}=1$. Then $\phi \in \mathrm{span}(\phi_1, \dots, \phi_n)$ and therefore
$$1+\delta \leq \phi(x) = x^{**}(\phi) \leq ||\phi||_{X^*} ||x^{**}||_{X^{**}} \leq 1,$$ I agree with most of the proof, however, I have a problem with one of last steps, namely why or how it follows that $\phi \in \mathrm{span}(\phi_1, \dots, \phi_n)$. There will be many functionals that fulfill the previous conditions $\phi|_{Y}=0$, $\phi(x) \geq 1+\delta$ and $||\phi||_{X^*}=1$, but are not in $\mathrm{span}(\phi_1, \dots, \phi_n)$. E.g. I think I could construct by Hahn-Banach also a functional $\psi$ that has a kernel $\ker \psi\supsetneq\ker \Phi$ and fulfills $\psi(x) \geq 1+\delta$ and $||\psi||_{X^*}=1$, but cannot be in $\mathrm{span}(\phi_1, \dots, \phi_n)$, since the kernel is a strict superset.

  $\pi:M\to P$ then $\pi$ is a locally trivial fiber bundle whose standard
  fiber is $\mathbb{T}^k\times\mathbb{R}^{n-k}$. Is this just an easy exercise? or is a special case of some other result? and in such a case is there a useful reference?

37398,What is the geometric interpretation of the transpose?,"I can follow the definition of the transpose algebraically, i.e. as a reflection of a matrix across its diagonal, or in terms of dual spaces, but I lack any sort of geometric understanding of the transpose, or even symmetric matrices. For example, if I have a linear transformation, say on the plane, my intuition is to visualize it as some linear distortion of the plane via scaling and rotation. I do not know how this distortion compares to the distortion that results from applying the transpose, or what one can say if the linear transformation is symmetric. Geometrically, why might we expect orthogonal matrices to be combinations of rotations and reflections?","['geometric-interpretation', 'transpose', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'orthogonal-matrices']"
37417,A Question on Schlicht Functions,"Denote the class of Schlicht functions (injective, holomorphic on the unit disk, with $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$) by $\mathcal{S}$.  And let $\gamma :[0,\infty )\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a simple curve (continuous and injective) and such that $\gamma (0)=0$ and $\lim _{t\to \infty}\gamma (t)=\infty$. I have to show that, for each such $\gamma$, there is a unique $t>0$ so that $\mathbb{C} \backslash \gamma \left( [t,\infty )\right)$ is the image of some $f\in \mathcal{S}$. Here's my idea so far: For each $t$, via the Riemann Maping Theorem, I can construct a bijective, holomorphic function $f_t:\mathbb{C} \backslash \gamma \left( [t,\infty )\right) \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$ ($\mathbb{D}$ is the unit disk) such that $f_t(0)=0$.  Furthermore, such an $f_t$ is unique up to a choice of the argument of $f_t'(0)$.  If I could somehow show that there must be some $t>0$ such that $\left| f_t'(0)\right| =1$ I would be done, but I am stuck as how to do this. Anyone have any ideas?  In the same direction or not, all suggestions are welcome.",['complex-analysis']
37432,nth powers modulo all primes,"Let $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, $n \in \mathbb{N}^*$ be integers, and set $P=X^n - a$. Let us consider the three following statements : 1) $P$ has a root in $\mathbb{Z}$ (i.e. $a$ is an nth power) 2) $P$ has a root in $\mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z}$ for all $d \ge 1$ (i.e. $a$ is an nth power mod $d$ for all $d$) 3) $P$ has a root in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for all prime $p$ (i.e. $a$ is an nth power mod $p$ for all prime $p$) I would like to prove that they are equivalent, but I still can't prove $3 \Rightarrow 1$. Here's what I already know : Obviously we have $1 \Rightarrow 2 \Rightarrow 3$ Proving $2 \Rightarrow 1$ is not very difficult ($2 \Rightarrow$ all $p$-adic valuations of a are multiples of $n$) I think I can prove $3 \Rightarrow 1$ in the case $n = 2$. But my proof seems quite involved (and frankly a bit of an overkill) for this question : Roughly, if $a$ is not a square, I use the quadratic reciprocity law and Dirichlet's theorem to prove that there exist a prime $p$ for which the Legendre symbol of $a$ mod $p$ is $-1$. So I guess my questions are : Can we prove $3 \Rightarrow 1$ ? Is there an ""elementary"" proof ?

37446,When a change of variable results in equal limits of integration,"Here is something that's been bugging me for a while. Say we want to find $$I = \displaystyle\int\nolimits_{a}^{b}f(g(t))g'(t)\,\mathrm dt.$$ If we substitute $x = g(t)$, then $$I = \displaystyle\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)}f(x)\,\mathrm dx.$$ But what do we do in the case where $g(a) = g(b)$? How do we interpret that? For example, if $x = \sin{t}$, $a = 0$, and $b = \pi$, then $g(a) = \sin(0) = \sin(\pi) = g(b)$. It would appear that the integral would be zero, but I find it isn't. What to do when a given substitution makes both limits the same?","['definite-integrals', 'calculus', 'integration']"

37496,Nitpicky question about harmonic series,"I wanted to prove as much as I could about the rate of divergence of the harmonic series without resorting to textbooks; I did this by checking a little computationally and using that as motivation for the next bit. It wasn't very hard to prove the following $$
\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{n} = \log N + \gamma + O\Big(\frac{1}{N}\Big).
$$ I then wanted an estimate for the implied constant above, and extensive computations showed that for all $N \in \mathbb{N}$, $$
N\bigg( \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{n} - \log N - \gamma\bigg) < \frac{1}{2} \qquad\qquad\qquad (1)
$$ although this quantity does converge to $\frac{1}{2}$ from below (I plotted this sequence up to $N=10^{200}$ or so). This suggests that $C=\frac{1}{2}$ is the best implied constant we can get. Now, Example 2.1.10 here seems to imply $$
N\bigg( \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{n} - \log N - \gamma\bigg) > \frac{1}{2}, \qquad\qquad\qquad (2)
$$ at least for all $N$ large enough. Question: I am confused -- why is there an apparent contradiction in (1) and (2)?

My first question is: Is this limit really a probability? Also, the nonrigorous/heuristic proofs that I have seen of this start by mentioning that ""the probability that a prime $p$ divides a positive integer is $1/p$"". This makes intuitive sense. I was wondering though: Is there a way of defining a probability measure on the positive integers in such a way that the set {$n \in \mathbf Z_+$ | $p$ divides $n$} has measure $1/p$ (that we can use for a rigorous proof)?","['probability', 'number-theory']"

37528,Topology on the general linear group of a topological vector space,"Let $K$ be a topological field . Let $V$ be a topological vector space over $K$ (if it makes things convenient, you may assume it is finite dimensional). Naive Question: Is there a canonical way of defining a topology on $\text{GL}(V)$? Attempted Focusing of Naive Question: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the subcategory of $\mathsf{TVect}_K$ with the same objects (topological $K$-vector spaces) but where the morphisms are just the isomorphisms from $\mathsf{TVect}_K$. Can we define a functor $A:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathsf{TGrp}$ such 
that $B(A(V))=\text{GL}(V)$ for all $V\in \mathcal{C}$, where $B:\mathsf{TGrp}\rightarrow\mathsf{Grp}$ is the forgetful functor Let $X=K^d$ with the standard (product) topology. Then $A(X)\cong\!\! \text{GL}_d(K)$, where $\text{GL}_d(K)$ is given the subspace topology from $K^{d^2}$ Let $Y=K^d$ with the trivial (indiscrete) topology. Then $A(Y)\cong\!\!\text{GL}_d(K)$, where $\text{GL}_d(K)$ is given the trivial topology In short, I want to avoid ""silly"" answers, like $A(V)=\text{GL}(V)$ with the trivial topology for all $V$. I'm not sure if my above conditions will sufficiently rule out that kind of thing, but if you see a ""silly"" answer, I encourage you to post it so that either I can hone my question better, or I can see why there is no well-defined question to ask here. Motivation: In my differential topology class today, there was a lot of debate about what the topology on the Grassmanian $\text{Gr}(r,V)$  was (for $V$ an $\mathbb{R}$-vector space). The professor ultimately gave what was, in my opinion, an unaesthetic answer that depended on choosing a basis for $V$ (which I avoid when possible) and, now that $V$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ are identified via the choice of basis, using the inner product structure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ (which I also avoid when possible) to define a metric, and hence topology, on the set of $r$-dimensional subspaces. In particular, I saw no reason there should fail to be a topology on $\text{Gr}(r,V)$ in the absence of an inner product structure on $V$, so my motivation here is to define a canonical topology on $\text{Gr}(r,V)$ for any topological vector space $V$. Looking at the Wikipedia page on Grassmanians , it seems the natural way of going about this would just be to have a topology on $\text{GL}(V)$, and then put the quotient topology on $\text{Gr}(r,V)=\text{GL}(V)/H$ where $H=\text{Stab}(W)$ for some $r$-dimensional subspace $W\subset V$. This raised the question of what exactly the topology was on $\text{GL}(V)$, which is what I'm asking here now.","['topological-vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra', 'grassmannian', 'topological-groups']"

I obviously realise that the formula implies that an exponential with a variable imaginary part can be visualised as a complex function going around in a unit circle about the origin of the complex plane. But WHY is this? And why is e so special that it moves at just a fast enough rate so that the argument of the exponential is equal to the arc length of the path made by the locus (i.e. the angle in radians we've moved around the circle)?
