156144,Big Oh notation Question in calculus,"In my text book, they state the following: $$\begin{align*}f(x) &= (\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2}) (x-\frac{1}{2}x^2+\frac{1}{3}x^3+O(x^4))-1& ,x \rightarrow 0\\&= 1-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{3}x^2+\frac{1}{2}x-\frac{1}{4}x^3+O(x^3)-1& ,x \rightarrow 0 \end{align*}$$ However, when I calculate this, I get $1-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{3}x^2+\frac{1}{2}x-\frac{1}{4}x^3+O(x^3)+\frac{O(x^4)}{2}-1$.
That $O(x^4)$ part disappears I guess, due to the big O notation. However, I cannot figure out why. Furthermore, a few pages later, they say that $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} O(x) = 0$.

156203,Essentially continuous a.e. characteristic function,"I'm reading a few papers and trying to understand why one paper is supposed to be a strengthening of the other. The bulk of the papers didn't have to do with what follows, but at one point they imply that an a.e. essentially continuous characteristic function is automatically a characteristic function of a set which is a.e. an open set, and this is stronger. I'll make the definitions rigorous: We say $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a point of $\textit{essential continuity}$ for $f$ (a function on $\mathbb{R}^n$) if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a neighborhood $U_{x,\varepsilon}$ of $x$ such that $|f(y)-f(x)| < \varepsilon$ for a.e. $y \in U_{x,\varepsilon}$ (hence the ""essentially"" continuous). I have two main questions (and one side question which is less important): Suppose the characteristic function $1_E$ is a.e. essentially continuous, that is, for a.e. $x$, $x$ is a point of essential continuity for $1_E$. Then why must $E$ be a.e. equivalent to an open set? For this question, I was thinking of letting $\varepsilon < 1$ be fixed, and then the definition of essential continuity implies that for a.e. $x$, there is a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that for a.e. $y \in U$, we have $|1_E(x)-1_E(x)| < 1$. In particular, this means either both $x$ and $y$ are in $E$, or both are not in $E$. I tried to let my open set $U$ be the union of all the $U_x$ for $x \in E$ which are points of essential continuity, but the problem is there may be points $y$ in each $U_x$ which are not in $E$, and there could be uncountably many $U_x$. Thus the resulting $U$ is not in fact open. Is there a good example of a set $E$ which is a.e. equivalent to an open set, but $1_E$ is not a.e. essentially continuous? I don't really know where to start with this one, but I imagine we require a highly disjoint set, like some sort of fat cantor set. This particular set won't work though, since the fat Cantor set, say $K$, is not equivalent to an open set, but perhaps the complement $[0,1] \setminus K$ will work - I'm stuck on this too though. I'm curious if we can strengthen 1 and 2: with the hypothesis of 1, why must both $E$ and $E^c$ be a.e. equivalent to open sets? And for 2, does there exist a set $E$ a.e. equivalent to an open set such that $E^c$ is also a.e. equivalent to an open set, and $1_E$ is not a.e. essentially continuous? The motivation for 3 is that I believe the first paper's result can be strengthened from a statement about $E$ being a.e. equivalent to an open set, to a statement about both $E$ and $E^c$ being equivalent to an open set. If so, then in order for the second paper to be a true generalization, point 3 must hold. Any help is appreciated, thanks.",['measure-theory']

156218,Covering points on a sphere with a disk,"Suppose $m$ points (""sites"") are selected on the unit sphere $S^2$. For a given radius $r < \pi$, we can define a disk around any point on the sphere as the set of points at geodesic distance at most $r$ from it. Let $k$ be the maximum number of sites contained in any such disk. Is there a nice lower bound on $k$ in terms of $r$? In other words, what should the function $k(r)$ be so that, no matter where the $m$ sites are placed, we can always find a disk of radius $r$ containing $k(r)$ of them? I would hope it is simply $m$ times the fraction of the surface area of the sphere covered by a disk. After all, if the average density of sites on the sphere is $m/A$, there must be some disk whose density is at least the average, right? This would be easily proved if you could tile the sphere with disks with no overlap, but you can't, so I'm not sure. If it turns out to depend on the packing density of disks on a sphere, I'll be happy with a reasonable lower bound. If you replace the unit sphere and the disks with unit ball and smaller balls of radius $r < 1$ in $\mathbb R^3$, and the area ratio with the volume ratio, then the naive guess doesn't work. You can have $m/2$ sites clustered around one point near the surface of the unit ball and the other $m/2$ sites around the antipodal point, so that for $\sqrt[3]{\frac1{2}} < r < 1$, the volume of a ball of radius $r$ is more half that of the unit ball, but you can't get more than $m/2$ sites inside it. Perhaps it still works in some asymptotic sense; I'm curious about anything rigorous that can be said in this case too. Finally, although I've stated the above question for the 2-sphere and ball in $\mathbb R^3$, I'm also interested in the generalization to higher dimensions.","['general-topology', 'geometry', 'geometric-topology', 'tiling']"

156238,Kaplansky's theorem of infinitely many right inverses in monoids?,"There's a theorem of Kaplansky that states that if an element $u$ of a ring has more than one right inverse, then it in fact has infinitely many. I could prove this by assuming $v$ is a right inverse, and then showing that the elements $v+(1-vu)u^n$ are right inverses for all $n$ and distinct. To see they're distinct, I suppose $v+(1-vu)u^n=v+(1-vu)u^m$ for distinct $n$ and $m$. I suppose $n>m$. Since $u$ is cancellable on the right, this implies $(1-vu)u^{n-m}=1-vu$. Then $(1-vu)u^{n-m-1}u+vu=((1-vu)u^{n-m-1}+v)u=1$, so $u$ has a left inverse, but then $u$ would be a unit, and hence have only one right inverse.

156263,Solving a quadratic?,"Lets say you have a quadratic that you factor into root form. To solve for the roots, you let the $y$ value be $0$: $0 = (x_1-h)(x_2-k)$ Following this you would divide both sides by one of the multipliers. 
This would leave you with $x_1-h =0$ and therefore $x_1 =h$ and $x_2-k = 0$ and therefore $x_2 = k$. However since the product of both the multipliers is zero, one of them has to be zero (the product of two or more numbers can't be zero unless atleast one of them is zero). Therefore, aren't you essentially dividing by zero by dividing by one of the multipliers? For example, $x_1-h = 0$. To solve for $x_2$, you would do the following: $0 = (x_1-h)(x_2-k)$ $\frac{0}{x_1-h} = \frac{(x_1-h)(x_2-k)}{(x_1-h)}$ $0 = x_2 - k$ $x_2 = k$ However, since $x_1 -h = 0$, didn't you essentially divide by zero to solve for $x_2$?

156264,Building the integers from scratch (and multiplying negative numbers),"Now I understand that what I am about to ask may seem like an incredibly simple question, but I like to try and understand math (especially something as fundamental as this) at the deepest level possible. And for the life of me, I can't shake this feeling I have that something is not quite right. Let me begin: First of all, I was reading Terry Tao's discussion about the construction of the standard number system and was very pleased with the way in which $\mathbb{C}$ can be systematically constructed from the natural numbers through a system of homomorphisms (as a direct limit): $$\mathbb{N} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$$ In particular, he talks about how the integers can be constructed as the space of equivalence classes of formal differences between natural numbers, where $$[a-b]\sim[c-d ] \iff a+d=b+c$$ with $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{N}.$ He then goes on to say "" with the arithmetic operations extended in a manner consistent with the laws of algebra ."" Now, for $(\mathbb{N},+,\cdot)$ addition is straight forward, and $$n\cdot k:=\underbrace{k+\cdots+k}_{n\;\text{times}}$$ is well defined with $n\cdot k=k\cdot n$. Moreover, the distributive law, $n\cdot(m+k)=n\cdot m+n\cdot k$, also holds. However, when I want to construct $(\mathbb{Z},+,\cdot)$ as above, I run into some trouble. Addition of two equivalence classes seems pretty straightforward, given by $$[a-b] + [c-d] := [ (a+c)-(b+d) ],$$ and is well defined. This makes sense as we simply ""add up"" the positive and negative amounts together. This definition also behaves nicely with the map $\varphi:\mathbb{N}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{Z}$, given by $n\mapsto[ n-0 ]$; with $\varphi(n+k)=\varphi(n)+\varphi(k)$, where the second addition is the addition of equivalence classes. Moreover, we have commutativity of addition; the existence of an additive identity, namely $[0-0]$; and the existence of additive inverses, $[a-b]+[b-a]\sim[0-0].$ But now, when I try to define the multiplication of classes, I am unsure how to proceed: If we consider our usual algebraic rules, we get that $$(a-b)\cdot(c-d)=a\cdot c-a\cdot d-b\cdot c+b\cdot d,$$ which might lead us to define the multiplication of two equivalence classes as $$[ a-b ]\cdot[ c-d ]:=[ (a\cdot c+b\cdot d)-(a\cdot c+b\cdot c) ].$$ Now it's easy to check that this is indeed well defined, and obeys the distributive law with the definition of addition we've given above. However I feel that we've simply gone in a circle (logically) as we've assumed a priori that $(-b)\cdot c=-(b\cdot c)$ and $(-b)\cdot(-d)=-(b\cdot d)$. Now, I am very familiar with the fact that if your set is a ring (with unity) then these results (particularly that negative times negative is positive ) come as simply a result of playing around with additive inverses and the distributive laws ( see here ). However my problem is that we've only gotten this ring structure on our set of equivalence classes by appealing to the ring structure of the integers, which is exactly the thing we are trying to construct from scratch! And I do not want to simply define multiplication in this way ""because it works""; it has always been my feeling that results like $(-1)\cdot(-1)=1$ should come as consequences of the structure, and not as properties we impose. So I'm curious if there is a way around this issue. Is this particular definition of multiplication the only one that: is well defined? satisfies the distributive laws? is associative? has a multiplicative identity? $$[1-0]\cdot[a-b]=[a-b],\;\text{for all $a,b\in\mathbb{N}$}$$ gives a homomorphism which splits over multiplication? $$\varphi:(\mathbb{N},+,\cdot)\hookrightarrow(\mathbb{Z},+,\cdot),\; n\mapsto[ n-0 ]$$ $$\varphi(n\cdot k)=\varphi(n)\cdot\varphi(k)=[ n-0 ]\cdot[ k-0 ]$$ If our deffiniton of of multiplication has all these properties, then we'll have a ring structure on our set of equivalence classes, and all the familiar properties of the integers will be established. However, it is not immediately clear to me that this is our only option. Can someone shed some light on this?","['arithmetic', 'elementary-set-theory']"

156285,Proving that $S_n$ has order $n!$,"I have been working on this exercise for a while now. It's in B.L. van der Waerden's Algebra (Volume I) , page $19$. The exercise is as follows: The order of the symmetric group $S_n$ is $n!=\prod_{1}^{n}\nu$. (Mathematical induction on $n$.) I don't comprehend how we can logically use induction here. It seems that the first step would be proving $S_1$ has $1!=1$ elements. This is simply justified: There is only one permutation of $1$, the permutation of $1$ to itself. The next step would be assuming that $S_n$ has order $n!$. Now here is where I get stuck. How do I use this to show that $S_{n+1}$ has order $(n+1)!$? Here is my attempt: I am thinking this is because all $n!$ permutations of $S_n$ now have a new element to permutate. For example, if we take one single permutation
$$
p(1,\dots,n)
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & \dots & n\\
1 & 2 & 3 & \dots & n
\end{pmatrix}
$$
We now have $n$ modifications of this single permutation by adding the symbol $(n+1)$: \begin{align}
p(1,2,\dots,n,(n+1))&=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & \dots & n & (n+1)\\
1 & 2 & \dots & n & (n+1)
\end{pmatrix}\\
p(2,1,\dots,n,(n+1))&=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & \dots & n & (n+1)\\
2 & 1 & \dots & n & (n+1)
\end{pmatrix}\\
\vdots\\
p(n,2,\dots,1,(n+1))&=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & \dots & n & (n+1)\\
n & 2 & \dots & 1 & (n+1)
\end{pmatrix}\\
p((n+1),2,\dots,n,1)&=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & \dots & n & (n+1)\\
(n+1) & 2 & \dots & n & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align} There are actually $(n+1)$ permutations of that specific form, but we take $p(1,\dots,n)=p(1,\dots,n,(n+1))$ in order to illustrate and prove our original statement. We can make this general equality for all $n!$ permutations: $p(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)=p(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n,x_{n+1})$ where $x_i$ is any symbol of our finite set of $n$ symbols and $x_{n+1}$ is strictly defined as the symbol $(n+1)$. We can repeat this process for all $n!$ permutations in $S_n$. This gives us $n!n$ permutations. Then, adding in the original $n!$ permutations, we have $n!n+n!=(n+1)n!=(n+1)!$. Consequently, $S_n$ has order $n!$. How is my reasoning here? Furthermore, is there a more elegant argument? I do not really see my argument here as incorrect , it just seems to lack elegance. My reasoning may well be very incorrect, however. If so, please point it out to me.","['induction', 'group-theory', 'symmetric-groups']"

156317,Combinatorics and graph theory - counting connected graphs,"We denote by $C(n,n+k)$ the number of connected graphs on $n$ vertices with $n+k$ edges. I have 2 problems I wish to prove, but after much effort have gotten nowhere with. I would greatly value some help on this, as I have an exam coming up soon and this is the last section of my course I feel I am failing to understand. Question 1. Show that for every $k \geq -1$ there is some constant $c_k$ such that $C(n,n+k) \sim c_k n^{n + (3k-1)/2}$. As I said, I've tried to come up with something, but I've really not made any progress; I can't say $(3k-1)/2$ is an expression I've come across before in graph-counting, so I can't see any obvious route to take. So, knowing this we can say for example that $C(n,n-1) = n^{n-2}$ by Cayley's formula; every connected graph on $n$ vertices with $n-1$ edges must be a tree, and therefore $c_{-1} = 1$. Similarly it can be shown that $c_0 = \sqrt{\pi / 8}$; e.g. by considering graphs with single cycles. Thus my next question may be somewhat obvious: Question 2. Show that $c_1$ = 5/24; i.e. $C(n,n+1) \sim (5/24)n^{n+1}$. (The question also says: ""To save you the trouble of computing the central absolute moments of the standard normal distribution, use that $\int_0^\infty x^3 e^{-x^2/2}dx = 2$."" This probably gives a big hint about how to solve the problem, though if you have an alternative method that would be equally welcome.) Once again, I've gotten nowhere with this one. I think maybe you have to consider it as a case-by-case basis: start with a tree with $n-1$ edges and then consider all the ways you could possibly add 2 edges and the different graph structures that could result. However, I've had no success. Anyway, these questions have me stumped and as I said above, any proof you could provide (or if necessary a source for a proof) would be greatly valued - preferably as soon as you are able please, sadly exams wait for no (wo/)man! As a matter of interest, I'd also like to know (though less important than the previous 2 questions): Question 3. Are any other values of $c_i$ known? Is there some clever method which will allow us to calculate lot of these constants, or (as is the case with $i = -1,\,0$) do they all require some clever gimmick unique to that value of $i$? No worries if you don't know, it's not important but I was just interested in whether they got much academic interest or whether these were questions purely for the sake of asking questions.

156318,Proof that every metric space is homeomorphic to a bounded metric space,"I have tried to show that every metric space $(X,d)$ is homeomorphic to a bounded metric space.  My book gives the hint to use a metric $d'(x,y)=\mbox{min}\{1,d(x,y)\}$. If we can show that $d(x,y) \le c_1 \cdot d'(x,y)$ with $c_1$ some positive constant and $d'(x,y) \le c_2 \cdot d(x,y)$ for $c_2$ some positive constant, then the identity map $i:(X,d) \to (X,d')$ is continuous, and also obviously a bijection, thus showing that $(X,d)$ is homeomorphic to $(X,d')$, where $(X,d')$ is bounded, thus giving the desired result. Suppose $d(x,y)<1$.  Then $d'(x,y)=d(x,y)$.  If $d(x,y)\ge 1$, then $d'(x,y) \le d(x,y)$.  Thus we can set $c_2 = 1$ and $d'(x,y) \le d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \in X$. But when $d(x,y)>1$ why won't it always be the case that $c_1$ will depend on what $d(x,y)$ is?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

If we have a perfect coin and we flip it twice we get the probability to equal this: $$\frac 12 \times \frac 12 = \frac 14$$ or for four flips we get this: $$\frac 12 \times \frac 12 \times \frac 12 \times \frac 12 = \frac 1{16}$$ So as we approach an infinite amount of coin flips, the probability gets smaller and smaller, but it shouldn't ever reach zero, so the probability shouldn't be zero, it should be $1/+\infty$.

156584,Mathematical idea behind tax bracket,"This may be a lame question. The tax bracket is a way to calculate the tax based on the taxable income. For example Imagine that there are three tax brackets: 10%, 20%, and 30%. The 10%
  rate applies to income from $\$$1 to $\$$10,000; the 20% rate applies
  to income from $\$$10,001 to $\$$20,000; and the 30% rate applies to
  all income above $\$$20,000. Under this system, someone earning $\$$10,000 would be taxed at a rate of
  10%, paying a total of $\$$1,000. Someone earning $\$$5,000 would pay
  $\$$500, and so on. Meanwhile, someone earning $\$$35,000 would face a more complicated
  calculation. The rate on the first $\$$10,000 would be 10%; the rate
  from $\$$10,001 to $\$$20,000 would be 20%; and the rate above that
  would be 30%. Thus, he would pay $\$$1,000 for the first $\$$10,000 of
  income; $\$$2,000 for the second $\$$10,000 of income; and $\$$4,500
  for the last $\$$15,000 of income; in total, he would pay $\$$7,500,
  or about 21.4%. In my understanding, the idea of tax bracket for computing tax is as follows: first fill the taxable income into the tax brackets in the order of  tax rates from low to high, then multiply the amount in each tax bracket, by the corresponding tax rate, finally sum up the the products over the tax brackets to obtain the tax. I was wondering if such an idea is also used (elsewhere) in mathematics, including statistics, mathematical modelling? If yes, in what situations is this idea used usually? Thanks! Added: After some further thought, I realized the following thing. What we called tax rate at a certain amount of income is actually the tax per unit increase from the income, also called marginal tax rate , so the tax rate is a function of the income, i.e. a function from $[0, \infty) \to [0,1]$.
