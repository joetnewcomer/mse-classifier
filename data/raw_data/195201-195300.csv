3757690,Prove that a graph on $2n$ vertices with at least $n^2+1$ edges has at least $n$ triangles.,"Let $n>1$ be an integer.  A graph $G$ consists of $2n$ vertices and at least $n^2+1$ edges.   Show that there exists at least $n$ triangles. I already have a proof which is induction on $n$ . But is there any direct method to do it? UPDATE:
Sketched inductive proof:
Consider $n=k+1$ case. It can be shown there exists triangle $ABC$ . Suppose in the rest of $2k-1$ points there are $P_A, P_B,P_C$ edges connecting to $A,B,C$ respectively. Case 1: $P_A+P_B+P_C \geq 3k-1$ . It can be shown there are at least $k$ triangles taking one of $AB,BC,CA$ as edge, plus $ABC$ , we get $k+1$ triangles. Case 2: $P_A+P_B+P_C \leq 3k-2$ . Then one of $P_A+P_B, P_B+P_C,P_C+P_A$ must $\leq 2k-2$ . Suppose $P_A+P_B \leq 2k-2$ . One can show the other $2k-1$ points and C form a graph and have at least $(k+1)^2+1-(2k-2)-3=k^2+1$ edges ( $3$ is from triangle $ABC$ ). By induction we have $k$ triangles, plus $ABC$ , and we get $k+1$ .","['graph-theory', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
3757701,Integrate $\Omega=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\operatorname{arccot}(x)}{x^4+x^2+1}dx$,"A friend of mine got me the problem proposed by Vasile Mircea Popa from Romania, which was published in the Romanian mathematical Magazine . The problem is to find: $$\Omega=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\operatorname{arccot}(x)}{x^4+x^2+1}dx$$ As per the Wolfram alpha the evaluated value is found to be $0$ . The reason is since $\operatorname{arccot}(x)=-\operatorname{arccot}(-x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb C^+$ is an odd function . However, the next answer obtained is $\frac{\pi^2}{ 2\sqrt{3}}$ where  the relations $\text{arccot}(x)=\frac{\pi}{2}-\operatorname{arctan}(x)\cdots(1)$ is used keeping in the view of principal branch of $\operatorname{arccot}(x)$ . The works is as follows: $$\Omega=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\frac{\pi}{2}-\operatorname{arctan}(x)}{x^4+x^2+1}dx=\frac{\pi}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{dx}{x^4+x^2+1}-\underbrace{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\operatorname{arctan}(x)}{x^4+x^2+1}}_{\text{odd function}}dx\\\overbrace{=}^{xy=1}\frac{\pi}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{x^2 dx}{x^4+x^2+1}=\frac{\pi}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{dx}{\left(x-\frac{1}{x}\right)^{2}+3}$$ then, by Cauchy Schlömilch transformation (Special case of Glasser's Masters  theorem) we obtain $$\Omega= \frac{\pi}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{dx}{x^2+3}=\frac{\pi^2}{2\sqrt{3}}$$ Note that former integral can be solved without using aforementioned theorem, by the partial fraction of $x^4+x^2+1=(x^2+x+1)(x^2-x+1)$ . My question is, Which of the above work is correct? In my view the first work is correct.

3757773,Is there a simple proof that a non-invertible matrix reduces to give a zero row?,"Let $A$ be a square matrix that is non-invertible. I was wondering if there is a simple proof that we can apply elementary row operations to get a zero row. (For a matrix $C$ to be invertible, I mean there is $B$ such that $CB = BC = I$ .) I can prove this using elementary column operations but I would like a more direct proof that doesn’t appeal to column operations or the fact that row rank equals column rank, or anything to do with transposes, or the existence of RREF, or determinants, etc. The difficulty seems to be that elementary row operations are applied on the row space, whereas invertibility is sort of defined in terms of the column space. You could also use (but it is preferred not to) facts like: A matrix $C$ being invertible is equivalent to null space of $C$ being zero (i.e. injective) is equivalent to $C$ being surjective.","['matrices', 'gaussian-elimination', 'linear-algebra']"
3757779,Significance of Codomain of a Function,"We know that Range of a function is a set off all values a function will output.

My Questions Does knowing codomain of a function give any insight/information about the function? Every function has a specific range and it is universal? Is it true for codomain also? What I am trying to say is that range of $\sin x$ is $[-1,1]$ .While as per my understanding codomain is $\mathbb R$ (Real Numbers). But defining codomain of $\sin x$ as say $(-2,2)$ is not going to change anything. So $(-2,2)$ is a valid codomain for $\sin x$ . Am I right? What compelled mathematicians to define codomain, why were they not happy with the concept of range only?","['notation', 'real-numbers', 'definition', 'functions']"

3757844,Proof verification: polynomials $\mathbb R[X]$ are a vector space that is not isomorphic to its dual,"I have never seen an elementary proof of the fact that $V$ need not be isomorphic to $V^*$ that does not require some set theoretic background. I came up with this [most likely incorrect] argument, which does not seem to depend so much on set theoretic arguments, except for basic ideas of cardinality. I wish to have this particular proof vetted. Consider the vector space of polynomials $V \equiv \mathbb R[X]$ as an $\mathbb R$ vector space.
The set $B_V \equiv \{x^i : i \in \mathbb N \}$ is a basis for the vector space $V$ . Given any polynomial $p(x) \in \mathbb R[X]$ , since the polynomial $p$ only has finitely many non-zero coefficients. Thus $p(x)$ must be of the form $p(x) = \sum_{i \in \text{nonzero-powers}(p)} a_i x^i$ where the index set $\text{nonzero-powers}(p)$ has finite cardinality. Hence we can write any polynomial $p(x)$ as a finite linear combination of elements from the set $B_V$ . Next, consider the dual space $V^* \equiv \{ f : \mathbb R[X] \rightarrow \mathbb R \mid f \text{ is a linear function}  \}$ . We have the elements $eval_r$ which evaluate a polynomial at point $r \in \mathbb R$ as elements of $V^*$ .
More formally, $eval_r(p) \equiv p(r); \forall r \in \mathbb R, eval_r \in V^*$ . All the $eval_r$ are linearly independent. Intuitively, this is because we cannot pin down the value of all polynomials by evaluating them at some finite number of points. More formally, suppose that we have that $\sum_{i \in I} a_i eval_{r_i} = 0$ for some finite index set $I$ . So this gives us a way to extrapolate $eval_{i_0}$ from the other $eval_i$ . However, this is absurd, since the value of a polynomial of degree $2|I|$ is not determined by its value at $|I|$ points.  Hence all the $eval_r$ are linearly independent. This means that we have a linearly independent set $L_{V^*} \equiv \{ eval_r : r \in \mathbb R \}$ whose cardinality is that of $|\mathbb R|$ . Wrapping up, we have that the basis of $V$ , $B_V$ has cardinality $|\mathbb N|$ . A linearly independent set of $V^*$ , whose cardinality is a lower bound on the cardinality of $V^*$ , has cardinality $|\mathbb R|$ . Hence the vector spaces cannot be isomorphic since the cardinality of their bases are different. Is this correct?","['solution-verification', 'linear-algebra', 'vector-spaces']"

The question was to find the length of $OB$ . $\angle ABC = 90^o$ What I've done is so far: I made the triangle $ABC$ and named $\angle BAC = \alpha$ . By trigonometry, I have the values for $\sin{\alpha}$ and $\cos{\alpha}$ . I get $\cos{\alpha}=\frac{6}{\sqrt{40}}$ . Then I made the triangle $OCA$ and named $\angle OAB = \beta$ so $\angle OAC = \alpha + \beta$ . By using the cosinus rule, I have $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$ . Using the formula, $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos{\alpha}.\cos{\beta} - \sin{\alpha}.\sin{\beta}$ and making $\sin{\beta} = \sqrt{1 -\cos^2{\beta}}$ I finally get that $\cos{\angle OAB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ . Finally, by using the cosinus rule on the triangle $AOB$ I get $OB = \sqrt{26}$ . My only problem is this takes me way too long!

Little update I think there is also an invariance as in question here Conjecture $a^{(\frac{a}{b})^p}+b^{(\frac{b}{a})^p}+c\geq 1$ Theoretical method Well,Well this method is very simple but the result is a little bit crazy (for me (and you ?)) Well ,I know that if we put $n=2$ we can find (using parabola) an upper bound like $$x^{\left(\frac{1-x}{x}\right)^2}\leq ax^2+bx+c=p(x)$$ And $$(1-x)^{\left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right)^2}\leq ux^2+vx+w=q(x)$$ on $[\alpha,\frac{1}{2}]$ with $\alpha>0$ and such that $p(x)+q(x)<1$ In the neightborhood of $0$ we can use a cubic . Well,now we have (summing) : $$x^{\left(\frac{1-x}{x}\right)^2}+(1-x)^{\left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right)^2}\leq p(x)+q(x)$$ We add a variable $\varepsilon$ such that $(p(x)+\varepsilon)+q(x)=1$ Now we want an inequality of the kind ( $k\geq 2$ ): $$x^{\left(\frac{1-x}{x}\right)^{2k}}+(1-x)^{\left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right)^{2k}}\leq (p(x)+\varepsilon)^{\left(\frac{1-x}{x}\right)^{2k-2}}+q(x)^{\left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right)^{2k-2}}$$ Now and it's a crucial idea we want something like : $$\left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right)^{2k-2}\geq \left(\frac{1-(p(x)+\varepsilon)}{q(x)}\right)^y$$ AND : $$\left(\frac{1-x}{x}\right)^{2k-2}\geq \left(\frac{1-q(x)}{p(x)+\varepsilon}\right)^y$$ Now it's not hard to find a such $y$ using logarithm . We get someting like : $$x^{\left(\frac{1-x}{x}\right)^{2k}}+(1-x)^{\left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right)^{2k}}\leq q(x)^{\left(\frac{1-q(x)}{q(x)}\right)^{y}}+(1-q(x))^{\left(\frac{q(x)}{1-q(x)}\right)^{y}}$$ Furthermore the successive iterations of this method conducts to $1$ because the values of the differents polynomials (wich are an approximation of the initial curve) tend to zero or one (as abscissa).

The gradient $\nabla^{M}$ of $f$ is defined by the property, that $g_{p}(\nabla^{M}f,X)=d_{p}f(X)$ , where $p\in M$ , $X\in TM$ satisfying $X(p)\in T_{p}M$ and $d_{p}f:T_{p}M\longrightarrow T_{f(p)}\mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R}$ .

3757944,How do you move between an observer's frame orbiting a Kerr B-H and the B-H's frame? In context of photon emission from accretion disk.,"I'm struggling with the concept of moving to and from reference frames in GR. I'm doing a problem in Spacetime and Geometry by S. Carroll (Chapter 6, Question 6 - the text for the question is very long) and it's the idea of iron in an accretion disk on geodesics emitting photons of known frequency $$\nu_{0}$$ and then, depending on where the photon is emitted and the direction of rotation of the accretion disk compared to the Kerr B-H, what is the frequency of the photon measured by an observer very far away. One method I tried was using, from earlier in the book, $$\omega = -g_{\mu \nu}U^{\mu}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\lambda}$$ then if you assume the observer is stationary, and in the equatorial plane (as given in the question) you get that $$\omega = (1 - \frac{2GM}{r})^{\frac{-1}{2}}E$$ from the Killing vector and the normalisation of U in the Kerr metric. Then I think that the energy will be conserved along the Killing vector so just take $$E = \nu_{0}$$ if hbar = 1. So you end up with the formula $$\frac{\omega}{\nu_{0}} = (1 - \frac{GM}{r})^{\frac{-1}{2}}$$ which is just the Schwarzchild redshift formula right? So clearly this doesn't depend on anything to do with the accretion disk, or even the 'angular momentum' of the Kerr B-H, and I definitely feel like I'm doing something wrong. Furthermore, I have rearranged the Killing vectors for L and E then used them, and the fact the photon is on a null path in the equatorial plane, to get the full form for the dx/d(lambda) in terms of conserved quantities. I want to try doing the idea of moving between frames of a particle in the accretion disk but I'm really struggling with deriving the transformation between the particle's rest frame and then Black-Hole's frame. I'm thinking along the lines of the preservation of the line element and saying that, in a very small vicinity around the particle, spacetime looks like Minkowski spacetime so, using again that we're in the equatorial plane, $$ds^2 = -dt'^2 + dr'^2 + r^2d{\phi'}^2 = -(1 - \frac{2GM}{r})dt^2 + \frac{2GMa}{r}(dtd{\phi} + d{\phi}dt) + \frac{r^2}{\Delta}dr^2 + \frac{\Sigma^2}{r^2}d{\phi}^2$$ where $$\Sigma^2 = [(r^2 + a^2)^2 - a^2{\Delta} ] || \Delta = r^2 - 2GMr + a^2$$ then if you leave all the other components constant, you get the effects of, for example, $$\frac{dr'}{dr} = \frac{r}{\sqrt{\Delta}} $$ I'm really not sure if this is correct. I've also had some ideas like $$U^{\mu'} = \frac{\partial{x^{\mu'}}}{\partial{x^{\mu}}}U^{\mu}$$ where the particle frame is un-primed and the Black-Hole frame is primed, but still I'm struggling to find (convincingly) the partial derivatives. Please can someone give me a push in the right direction? I'm self studying (lockdown and all that) and I feel I'm missing some little conceptual, well basic, ideas like this. I don't know if this is against Stack Exchange policy, but please can you not give a full answer to Carroll's question, I would still like to try and fill in the gaps!","['physics', 'general-relativity', 'differential-geometry']"

Now I can change the form of the denominator to become easy enough to substitute as follows: $$\bigg (4 \bigg (\ \frac{9}{4}\ +x^2\bigg)\bigg) ^\frac{3}{2} $$ Which makes it clear that $x$ needs to be substituted as $x = \frac{3}{2} \tan \theta $ , and $dx = \frac{3}{2} \sec^2 \theta $ for later use. At this point I can represent $(1)$ in terms of my substituted trignometric function. The only problem comes with the denominator where I get stuck on the power.

The set of Appell sequences is an abelian group under umbral composition. The set of sequences of binomial type is a non-abelian group under umbral composition. The group of Sheffer sequences is a semi-direct product of those other two groups.

We have $X=\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}$ , $Y=\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,\pm i,\pm i\sqrt{2}\}$ , $p\colon Y\to X$ given by $p(z)=(z^2+1)^2$ . It is easy to see that this defines an (unbranched) 4-sheeted covering map, and that $\varphi\colon z\mapsto -z$ is a deck transformation. (1) I want to proof that apart from $\varphi$ and the identity, there are no other deck transformations for $p$ . One way to see this is as follows: We can extend $p$ to a branched holomorphic covering map $\overline{p}\colon \hat{\mathbb{C}}=\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}\to\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ , since $p$ is a meromorphic function. Then one can show that any deck transformation of $p$ extends to a deck transformation of $\overline{p}$ by Riemann's theorem on removable singularities. Now one notes that a deck transformation of a branched covering map must preserve the ramification index to see that our list of deck transformations was exhaustive. My question is:
Is there a way to prove statement (1) without going to the extension of $p$ to an unbranched covering map?**","['complex-analysis', 'riemann-surfaces', 'covering-spaces']"

Let $G\in\mathbb R^{k\times d}$ be a matrix with independent Gaussian entries. I'm interested in the mean and variance of $$\rho'=\frac{\langle Gx, Gy\rangle}{\|Gx\|_2\|G y\|_2}.$$ Another way to state this is that $Gx,Gy\in\mathbb R^k$ are Gaussian vectors with covariance matrix $\big(\begin{smallmatrix}1&\rho\\\rho&1\end{smallmatrix}\big)$ .
Thus $E[\langle Gx, Gy\rangle]=k \rho$ and $E[\|Gx\|_2^2]=E[\|Gy\|_2^2]=k$ .
From this we would expect $E[\rho']\approx\rho$ . I can make this more precise using the Gaussian Johnson Lindenstrauss lemma, which says that if $k=\varepsilon^{-2}\log1/\delta$ , then $\langle Gx, Gy\rangle=\rho(1\pm\varepsilon)\|x\|_2\|y\|_2$ with probability at least $1-\delta$ .
We can get similar bounds for $\|Gx\|_2^2=\|x\|_2^2(1\pm\varepsilon)$ and for $y$ . By Cauchy Schwartz we always have $\rho'\in[-1,1]$ , so we get roughly $$
E[\rho'] = \rho\,(1\pm O(1/\sqrt k)).
$$ However, if I series expand $\rho'$ at $\rho=0$ I get $$
\begin{align}
E[\rho']
&= E\left[\frac{g}{\sqrt{\chi^2_{k-1} + g^2}} + \frac{\chi_{k} \chi^2_{k-1} }{(\chi^2_{k-1} +g^2)^{3/2}}\rho
+O(\rho^2)\right]

+O(\rho^2)
\\&= \rho(1 + 1/(2k) + O(1/k^2)) +O(\rho^2),
\end{align}
$$ where $\chi_k^2$ and $\chi_{k-1}^2$ are independent Chi-Square distributed random variables, and $g$ is a standard Gaussian. At the same time it seems $f(\rho)=E[\rho']$ for $\rho\ge 0$ is a convex function, that $f(\rho)\le\rho$ , and that $f(1)=1$ .
Hence we must have $f(\rho)\ge \rho(1-1/(2k))$ and $$E[\rho'] = \rho(1+O(1/k)).$$ This is a quadratic improvement over the previous bound.

(\alpha^1)^{\alpha^1} & \cdots & (\alpha^1)^{\alpha^m}\\
(\alpha^2)^{\alpha^1} & \cdots & (\alpha^2)^{\alpha^m}\\

Question: "" is the matrix $V$ invertible? "" I have tested several examples, and it seems that $V$ is always invertible, but I have no idea how to prove it or find a counterexample. Here are two facts I understood: all diagonal elements are strictly positives, so the trace of $V$ is strictly positive. the matrix $V$ is not symmetric. Can anyone help prove or disprove the invertibility of $V$ ? Thanks a lot in advance for sharing any idea, any useful discussion and remark. For a better understanding of the problem, I add here an example: Example: Let $n=3$ and $d=2$ , then we have all possible choices for putting $2$ balls into $3$ bins as: $$B = \{(2,0,0),(0,2,0),(0,0,2),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1)\}.$$ The elements in the first row of the matrix $V$ are computed as: $$(\alpha^1)^{\alpha^1} = (2,0,0)^{(2,0,0)} = 2^2\times 0^0\times 0^0 = 4,$$ $$(\alpha^1)^{\alpha^2} = (2,0,0)^{(0,2,0)} = 2^0\times 0^2\times 0^0 = 0,$$ and so on. Thus, we have the matrix $V$ as: $$V = \begin{bmatrix}
4&0&0&0&0&0\\
    0&4&0&0&0&0\\
    0&0&4&0&0&0\\
    1&1&0&1&0&0\\
    1&0&1&0&1&0\\
    0&1&1&0&0&1\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$ which is clearly invertible. Remarks: Note that, the matrix $V$ is not always triangular. as an example, for n=3, d=3, the element $$(2,1,0)^{(1,2,0)} = 2^1\times 1^2 \times 0^0 = 2,$$ and $$(1,2,0)^{(2,1,0)} = 1^2\times 2^1 \times 0^0 = 2$$ which are both non-zeros, thus $V$ will be never invertible in this case. When the elements $(\alpha^i)^{\alpha^j}$ and $(\alpha^j)^{\alpha^i}$ (with $i\neq j$ ) are non-zeros, they may not be equal.
E.g., n=4, d=8, we have $$(1,1,2,4)^{(2,2,2,2)} = 64$$ but $$(2,2,2,2)^{(1,1,2,4)} = 256.$$ As a conclusion: ""the matrix $V$ is neither triangular nor symmetric in general.""","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'inverse']"

If $z_n$ is near $0$ , then $1+z_n\approx1$ , and $|z_{n+1}|\approx2\sqrt{|z_n|}>2|z_n|$ ; the sequence gets pushed away from $0$ . But of course if $z_n=0$ exactly, then $z_{n+1}=0$ and it converges trivially. If $z_n=1+\varepsilon$ is near $1$ , then $1+z_n\approx2$ , and $z_{n+1}\approx\sqrt{z_n}\approx1+\tfrac12\varepsilon$ is even closer to $1$ . So, given $z_0\in\mathbb C\setminus\{-1,0\}$ , if the sequence converges it must converge to $1$ . Consider the distance from $1$ : $$1-z_{n+1}=\frac{1+z_n-2\sqrt{z_n}}{1+z_n}=\frac{(1-\sqrt{z_n})^2}{1+z_n}=\frac{(1-z_n)^2}{(1+z_n)(1+\sqrt{z_n})^2}.$$ Since a square root has non-negative real part, $|1+\sqrt{z_n}|>1$ , and thus $$|1-z_{n+1}|<\frac{|1-z_n|^2}{|1+z_n|}.$$ Now consider the distance from $-1$ : $$1+z_{n+1}=\frac{1+z_n+2\sqrt{z_n}}{1+z_n}=\frac{(1+\sqrt{z_n})^2}{1+z_n}$$ $$|1+z_{n+1}|>\frac{1}{|1+z_n|}.$$ We also have $$1-z_{n+1}\!^2=(1-z_{n+1})(1+z_{n+1})=\frac{(1-z_n)^2}{(1+z_n)^2}$$ and $$\frac{1-z_{n+1}}{1+z_{n+1}}=\frac{(1-\sqrt{z_n})^2}{(1+\sqrt{z_n})^2}.$$ I don't know where this is going. Can we show that $\lim_{n\to\infty}|1-z_n|=0$ ? Here's another approach: $$z_{n+1}=\frac{2\sqrt{z_n}}{1+z_n}=\frac{2\sqrt{z_n}(1+z_n^*)}{|1+z_n|^2}$$ $$=\frac{2}{|1+z_n|^2}\big(\sqrt{z_n}+|z_n|\sqrt{z_n}^*\big).$$ Both $\sqrt{z_n}$ and its conjugate $\sqrt{z_n}^*$ have non-negative real part. This expression shows that $z_{n+1}$ is a conical combination of them, so its angle is between their angles, which are half of the original angle of $z_n$ . Thus, with $z_n=r_ne^{i\theta_n}$ , $$|\theta_{n+1}|\leq\frac{|\theta_n|}{2}$$ $$|\theta_n|\leq\frac{|\theta_0|}{2^n}\leq\frac{\pi}{2^n}$$ $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\theta_n=0.$$ I found something interesting, but maybe not useful. If $|z_{n+1}|=1$ then $$|1+z_n|^2=4|z_n|;$$ this equation represents a limacon , with shape parameters $a=4,\,b=\sqrt8$ . If $|z_{n+1}|<1$ then $z_n$ is outside of the curve, or in the tiny loop containing $0$ . If $|z_{n+1}|>1$ then $z_n$ is in the larger inside part of the curve (which includes the unit circle $|z_n|=1$ ). Going in the other direction, if $|z_n|=1,\,z_n=e^{i\theta_n}$ , then $$z_{n+1}=\frac{2}{|1+e^{i\theta_n}|^2}\big(e^{i\theta_n/2}+1e^{-i\theta_n/2}\big)$$ $$=\frac{2}{1+2\cos\theta_n+1}\big(2\cos(\theta_n/2)\big)$$ $$=\frac{\cos(\theta_n/2)}{\cos^2(\theta_n/2)}=\sec(\theta_n/2)>1.$$ And if $z_n=r_n>0$ , then $$z_{n+1}=\frac{2\sqrt{r_n}}{1+r_n}<1$$ because $$2\sqrt{r_n}<1+\sqrt{r_n}^2$$ $$0<\big(1-\sqrt{r_n}\big)^2.$$ My angle argument shows that $z_n$ is in the right half of the plane for $n\geq1$ , so $$|1+z_n|>1$$ and thus $$|1-z_{n+1}|<\frac{|1-z_n|^2}{|1+z_n|}<|1-z_n|^2$$ $$<|1-z_{n-1}|^4<\cdots<|1-z_1|^{2^n}$$ which clearly converges to $0$ , provided that $|1-z_1|<1$ . So we only need to show that the sequence eventually comes within the unit circle around $1$ .","['sequences-and-series', 'inequality', 'convergence-divergence', 'complex-numbers', 'dynamical-systems']"

Intuitively from single variable calculus I would expect the gradient $ \nabla \vec{f} = (\partial \vec{f}/ \partial x_1,\partial \vec{f}/ \partial x_2,\partial \vec{f}/ \partial x_3) $ to be proportional to $2x$ , however I also would expect it to be a 3x3 matrix.

3758394,"If an infinite set $S$ of positive integers is equidistributed, is $S+S$ also equidistributed?","By $S+S$ , I mean $\{x+y,$ with $x,y \in S\}$ . By equidistributed, I mean equidistributed in residue classes, as defined here (the definition is very intuitive, and examples of such equidistributed sets are provided on that page). My goal here is to prove that if $S$ is equidistributed and contains enough elements (see here ), then $S+S$ covers all the positive integers except a finite number of them. The first step, I think, would be to prove that $S+S$ is equidistributed. I d guess the proof is not difficult and this fact has probably been established, but I could not find a reference. The result seems obvious if you consider ""equidistribution modulo 1"" instead, so I suppose it can also be derived (probably in a similar way) for ""equidistribution in residue classes"", as the two concepts are closely related and based on a similar Weyl criterion (a continuous version for modulo 1, a discrete version for residue classes.) Special case If the infinite set $S$ of positive integers is such that if $x,y\in S$ then $x+y\notin S$ , it is easy to prove that $S$ equidistributed implies $S+S$ is also equidistributed. Note that $S$ is called a Sidon set or sum-free set .
Let $N_S(z)$ be the number of elements of $S$ less or equal to $z$ , and let's assume that $$N_S(z)\sim \frac{a z^b}{(\log z)^c} \mbox{ as } z\rightarrow\infty$$ where $a,b,c$ are non-negative real numbers with $b\leq 1$ . The sets that I am interested in all have $b>\frac{1}{2}$ , for instance, pseudo-primes ( $a=b=c=1$ ) or pseudo-superprimes ( $a=b=1, c=2$ ). Such sets satisfy this conjecture A (see here ) : all but a finite number of positive integers can be written as $z=x+y$ with $x, y \in S$ . That conjecture would imply that $S+S$ is de facto equidistributed, since essentially, in this case $S+S$ it is the set of all positive integers minus a finite number of them. However, that conjecture A is precisely what I would want to prove, so I can not use it as a justification to establish the much weaker result that $S+S$ is supposedly equidistributed if $b>\frac{1}{2}$ and $S$ is equidistributed. If $b\leq \frac{1}{2}$ , conjecture A is not true. Hints to prove the result and win the bounty In case it is not true, a counter-example will do. Assuming it is correct, a sketch of a proof for a simple case is enough. Here is how it could start. Let $T = S+S$ and $$S(n,q) = \{x\in S, x=q \bmod{n}\}.$$ We have $$T(n,q) = \bigcup_{p=0}^{n-1}\Big[S(n,p) + S(n,(q-p) \bmod{n} )\Big]$$ $$T=\bigcup_{q=0}^{n-1}T(n,q)$$ $T(n,q)$ is the subset of elements of $T$ that are equal to $q$ modulo $n$ . The subsets $T(n,q)$ for any given $n>1$ form a partition of $T$ . However the first union for $T(n,q)$ consists of potentially overlapping sets, making the problem non-trivial. Proving the result consists in proving that for any integer $n>1$ and $0\leq q,q'<n$ we have $$\frac{N_{T(n,q)}(z)} {N_{T(n,q')}(z)}\rightarrow 1 \mbox{ as } z\rightarrow \infty.$$ Again $N_T(z)$ counts the number of elements of $T$ less than or equal to $z$ . We can focus on sets $S$ such that $$N_S(z) \sim \frac{a z^b}{(\log z)^c} $$ with $0\leq b \leq \frac{1}{2}$ . I will offer the bounty even if the proof is only for the special case $b=\frac{1}{2}, c=0$ and $n=2$ . For computer experiments (generating such a set $S$ that is supposed to be equidistributed), proceed as follows: the positive integer $k$ belongs to $S$ if and only if $U_k < a/(2\sqrt{z})$ where the $U_k$ 's are independent uniform deviates on $[0, 1]$ . I did some experiments and here are the results, using $n=12, b=\frac{1}{2}$ and looking at all elements of $S$ and $T=S+S$ up to $10^6$ : Equidistribution in $S$ (modulo $n=12$ in this case) means that the ""Ratio_1"" tend to be identical and equal to $\frac{1}{n}$ as you look at more and more elements of $S$ , while equidistribution in $T$ means that the ""Ratio_2"" tend to be identical also converging to $\frac{1}{n}$ . I also did the same test on the set $S$ of perfect squares, which is notoriously not equidistributed. The results are below. Final notes: For perfect squares, $a=1, b=\frac{1}{2}, c=0$ . Even though $T$ , the set of sums of two perfect squares is not equidistributed, the set $T+T$ is the set of all non-negative integers, and is thus equidistributed (that set of course has $a=0, b=1, c=0$ ). The last table suggests that the equations $x^2 + y^2 = 12z+ 3$ , $x^2 + y^2 = 12z+ 7$ , $x^2 + y^2 = 12z+ 11$ do not have integer solutions, while $x^2 + y^2 = 12z$ , $x^2 + y^2 = 12z+6$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 12z+9$ might have only finitely many solutions.","['number-theory', 'additive-combinatorics', 'sumset', 'modular-arithmetic']"

As $\mathcal{L}$ is a subbundle of ${\rm P}V \times V$ , it inherits a fiber metric via $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ and so we may project the standard flat connection ${\rm D}$ on the trivial bundle to a connection $\nabla$ on $\mathcal{L}$ . Now, sections of $\mathcal{L}$ correspond to homogeneous functions $\mu\colon V\setminus \{0\} \to \Bbb C$ of degree $-1$ via passing $x \mapsto \mu(x)x$ to the quotient. If $X \in \mathfrak{X}({\rm P}V)$ , then the derivative of this map is $$({\rm D}_X\mu)_x = {\rm d}\mu_x(Xx)x+\mu(x)Xx,$$ so since $Xx \in (\Bbb Cx)^\perp$ (since $T_{{\Bbb C}x}({\rm P}V) \cong {\rm Hom}(\Bbb C x, (\Bbb C x)^\perp)$ ), we obtain $(\nabla_X\mu)_x = {\rm d}\mu_x(Xx)$ .

3758597,Proof that $\frac{d(\sin x)}{dx} = \cos x$ for $\frac{\pi}{2} < x < \pi$,"Let us assume that $x$ is an angle that lies in the second quadrant i.e. $\dfrac{\pi}{2} < x < \pi$ . We have to prove that $\dfrac{d(\sin x)}{dx} = \cos x$ . I will use the unit circle to prove this. The method will be like the one used by Grant Sanderson of 3Blue1Brown in this video , which is a part of his Essence of Calculus series. The angles are measured in radians. In the diagram below, I have marked the angle $x$ and $dx$ on the unit circle. The angle $dx$ approaches $0$ , so it is very very small but for the sake of clarity, I have made it considerably large. Now, since $dx$ is actually really small, we can approximate arc $AB$ as a straight line approximately perpendicular to $OA$ . We are measuring the angles in radians and we have a unit circle, so its radius is $1 \text{ units}$ . Hence, the length of arc (now line segment) $AB$ is $\dfrac{\theta}{r}$ , where $\theta$ is $\angle AOB$ i.e. $dx$ and $r = 1 \text{ units}$ . So, $AB = \dfrac{dx}{1} = dx$ . Now, $d(\sin x) = \sin(x+dx)-\sin x$ which is the change in the ordinate of $A$ and $B$ . Now, $AP = d(\sin x)$ and $AB = dx$ . Also, $\triangle APB \sim \triangle AOQ$ . So, $\angle BAP = \angle OAQ = \pi - x$ . $\cos(\angle BAP) = \dfrac{AP}{AB} = \dfrac{d(\sin x)}{dx}$ . And $\cos(\angle BAP) = \cos (\pi - x) = -\cos x$ So, $\dfrac{d(\sin x)}{dx} = -\cos x$ which is not the case at all, since $\dfrac{d(\sin x)}{dx}$ will be negative as $\sin(x+dx) < \sin x$ but the sign of $-\cos x$ will be positive as $\cos x < 0$ . So, what mistake did I make here? According to me, the mistake was in assuming that $AP = d(\sin x)$ . I think that $AP$ should be $|d(\sin x)|$ . And as $d(\sin x) < 0 \implies |d(\sin x)| = -d(\sin x)$ . This fixes everything but I still want to verify if this indeed is the cause of the error. Thanks! PS : Let me know if I should justify why $\triangle APB \sim \triangle OQA$ to make the question clearer.

Find the area of the largest square that contains exactly $n$ lattice points in its interior. This question is inspired by 1998 AHSME Problem 29, where $n=3$ . In that case, it suffices to consider squares containing $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)$ . Note that an optimal square must have parallel sides containing lattice points, and the distance between parallel lines through $(0,-1)$ and $(1,1)$ is $\leq \sqrt{5}$ , so the largest possible area for the square is $5$ . In fact, The following four lines intersect to form a square containing exactly $3$ lattice points with area $5$ : $$2x-y=-2, \quad 2x-y=3, \quad x+2y=-2, \quad x+2y=3.$$ $\hspace{3cm}$ Pick's theorem might be useful if one can translate the lattice so that all the vertices of square fall on points of the new lattice.","['area', 'geometry']"

The Weierstrass substitution , (named after K.Weierstrass (1815)), is a substitution used in order to convert trigonometric functions rational expressions to polynomial rational expressions. Integrals of this type are usually easier to evaluate. This substitution is constructed by letting: $$t = \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \iff x = 2\arctan(t)  \iff dx = \frac{2}{t^2+1}$$ Using basic trigonometric identities it is easy to prove that: $$\cos x = \dfrac{1 - t^2}{1 +  t^2}$$ $$\sin x = \dfrac{2t}{1 + t^2}$$ But I couldn't express $\ln(x)$ in terms of $t$ . Attempt 2 I tried using integration by parts but I couldn't find a workaround, it gets more complicated, really fast. $$ \int \frac{dx}{\sin(\ln(x))} \ = x \sin(\ln(x)) - \int \frac{\cot \left(\ln \left(x\right)\right)}{x\sin \left(\ln \left(x\right)\right)} $$ Attempt 3 The most logical substitution I could think of. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere though.

3758924,Why exactly can you change the order of integration in a double (and triple) integral?,"I'm currently studying multivariable Calculus doing double and triple integrals, and I'm slightly confused on why one can change the order of integration for a double integral. I have my own explanation, but it could be wrong. Is the following reasoning correct? Fubini's Theorem states that the double integral over a given 2D region where at least one of the variables has constants as their highest and lowest values (called a horizontally or vertically simple region, depending on which variable has the constants) is equal to the iterated integral where those constants are the outer integral's limits of integration (and the inner integral's limits are functions of the outer variable). My reasoning is: If the 2D region is describable as an equation of your two variables, say x and y, and the equation is separable, then you could simply solve for either x or y to get the inner integral's limits of integration, then see from your separated equation what endpoint values the other variable could take on. The 2D region doesn't necessarily have to have abrupt, flat lines as the endpoints for the outside-integral variable (as is depicted in pictures of these such regions in textbooks), but it does need to have endpoint values in terms of the outside variable that are constants. So, if the region doesn't have these abrupt lines to describe its endpoints for either variable, but either variable's endpoint values could be described as constants, then you could use any order of integration you like as long as your outer iterated integral has constants as the limits of integration. Is this correct, or does Fubini's Theorem explicitly state that any order of integration is usable (as long as the limits of integration are valid)? Also, in the proof for Fubini's Theorem for Triple Integrals, does the same logic essentially hold or is there another reason you can switch the order of integration?

I was able to only prove that if $b>\frac{1}{\|z_i\|}$ , $z=0$ is a stable fixed point by using lyapunov function as: \begin{align}& V =\frac{1}{2} z^T K z +\frac{1}{2}\dot{z}^T \dot{z}\\
\implies &  \dot{V}=\|\dot{z}\|^2\left(-b+ \frac{cos(\theta)}{\|z-z_i\|^2}\right)
\end{align} where $\theta$ is the angle between $\dot{z}$ and $z-z_i$ , so if $b>\frac{1}{\|z_i\|}\implies \dot{V}|_{z=0} <0$ independent of $cos(\theta)$ in an open neighborhood of the origin so $z=0$ is a stable fixed point. I tried to study the system near $z_i$ by using perturbation and introduced the parameter $\mu$ to the system as: $$\ddot{z}+b\dot{z}+ K z-(\|\dot{z}\|+\mu) \frac{z-z_i}{\|z-z_i\|^3}=0$$ to study the system near $z_i$ , I chose $\mu \gg \|\dot{z}(0)\|$ so the system becomes: $$\ddot{z}+b\dot{z}+ K z-\mu \frac{z-z_i}{\|z-z_i\|^3}=0$$ Choose lyapunov function as: $$\begin{align}&V=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} z^T K z +\frac{1}{2}\dot{z}^T \dot{z}+U_i}\\
\implies &\dot{V}=\frac{b\|\dot{z}\|^2}{(\frac{1}{2} z^T K z +\frac{1}{2}\dot{z}^T \dot{z}+U_i)^2}

$$ where $U_i=\frac{\mu}{\|z-z_i\|}$ , so at $z=z_i$ , $V=0$ and $\dot{V}>0$ , so $z=z_i$ is unstable. However, if I check the equilibrium points by letting the derivatives vanish the system is reduced to: $$K z=\mu \frac{z-z_i}{\|z-z_i\|^3}\implies \|z-z_i\|^3 K z=\mu(z-z_i) \text{ and } z \neq z_i$$ The right hand side can be made arbitrary small by choosing $\mu$ arbitrary small,since $K$ is full rank and $z\neq 0$ so it must be that $\|z-z_i\|$ is getting arbitrary small i.e. $z\rightarrow z_i$ . So the system has another equilibrium point $q$ that is getting closer and closer to the unstable node $z_i$ . I believe $q$ is a saddle point (I don't know how to prove it) and so I concluded that $z_i$ in my original system is a bifurcation between an unstable node and a saddle node.

    \int_{-1}^{1}g(x)\,\mathrm{d}x = 1.

3758984,"Show that $\mathrm{Cov}[g(X), h(X)] \ge 0$ whenever $g$ and $h$ are nondecreasing. [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Show $\mathbb{E}[f(X)g(X)] \geq \mathbb{E}[f(X)]\mathbb{E}[g(X)]$ for $f,g$ bounded, nondecreasing (2 answers) Closed 3 years ago . Intuitively, the covariance of two nondecreasing functions of a random variable should be nonnegative. However I can't seem to come up with a proof for this. Here is the formal setup: Let $X: (\Omega, \mathcal A)\to (\mathbb R, \mathcal B)$ be a random variable defined on the probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal A, P)$ and let $g$ and $h$ be nondecreasing functions $\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ . To make sure that everything is well-defined assume that $E[g(X)^2]<\infty$ and $E[h(X)^2]<\infty$ . Question: Is is always true that $$\mathrm{Cov}[g(X),h(X)]\ge 0\,?$$ Some notes: Note that the assertion is equivalent to showing that $E[g(X)h(X)]\ge E[g(X)]E[h(X)].$ I tried reducing the problem to showing that $$E[Xf(X)] \ge E[X]E[f(X)]$$ holds for every nondecreasing $f$ whenever $E[X^2]$ and $E[f(X)^2]$ are finite. To do this, I defined $Y=h(X),$ $f = g \circ h^{-1}$ and wrote $$E[g(X)h(X)]=E[g(h^{-1}(Y)Y] = E[f(Y)Y].$$ But this assumes that $h$ is strictly increasing, which is not necessarily true. Moreover, even in this case I'm not sure how to start.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'inequality', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

My second question is, assuming $S$ is a set. What is even met by the gluing compatibility conditions, $$res_{V \cap W }(s_i) = res_{V \cap W }(s_j) $$ For instance in the case of the skyscraper sheaf at a point $p$ , give an open covering of $U$ , $s_i$ may only even exist for the $U_i$ containing $p$ . From the definitions, it feels like you need to elements of a set to make the definition to make things work and implicitly a function associated with each element defined for every open subset of $U$ that maps to the empty set over subsets where an element disappears.

3759008,Proof for a combinatorial identity,"I have the following formula, which I believe it's true since it works in Mathematica for all values of $N$ I have tried, but I don't know how to prove it: $$\sum_{q=0}^{N} {N \choose q}^2 x^{q} =  \frac{1}{{2N \choose N}} \sum_{k,l=0}^N \; \sum_{s=0}^{\min(m, \ N-M)} \;  \sum_{t=0}^{\min(m, \, N-M)} \\ {N \choose M} {M \choose m-s} {N-M \choose s} {N \choose N-m} {N-m \choose N-M-t} {m \choose t} x^{M-m+s+t} $$ where $m=\min(k,l)$ and $M=\max(k,l)$ , and $x$ can be any complex number. I know one can write the LHS as a Legendre polynomial $ \sum_{q=0}^N { N \choose q }^2 x^q = (1-x)^N P_N \left( \frac{1+x}{1-x} \right)$ , and as a Hypergeometric function $ \sum_{q=0}^N { N \choose q }^2 x^q = \, _2F_1 (-N, -N, 1, x)$ , but apart from that I don't know how to simplify the RHS.

Again I have tried Egorychev method on the RHS, which allows you to write the sums in $s$ and $t$ as complex contour integrals, and then you can easily choose your limits in the sum to be whatever is more convenient so that you can actually compute the sums in $r$ and $s$ . But in exchange you now have four complex contour integrals (one for every summation limit you want to ""kill""), so I don't know if this is simpler.

(For example, swapping the $2$ $nd$ and $3$ $rd$ digit to give $11221212$ as a result, but swapping the $3$ $rd$ and $4$ $th$ digit is not allowed.) There is no limit on how many operations you can do on the number(no operation is also possible). How many possible numbers can be formed? Questions Is there a name to this kind of problems? How can it be solved? Extra: What if the original is not $12121212$ but some other numbers(like for example $121212121111111111$ ? Will this make the question very complicated? My attempt I am not sure how to approach this question. My observation is that the final configuration $11112222$ remains unchanged after any operations. So it seems that the first ' $2$ ' originally at $2$ $nd$ position moves to the $5$ $th$ position, the first ' $2$ ' orginally at $4$ $th$ position moves to the $6$ $th$ position and so on. However, some of the cases are invalid but at least I know that number of possible configurations is less than $4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1 = 24$ .

If such a non-constant field exists, it's clear that we can first choose some point $\vec x$ and decompose our vector field, into a component $F_{\vec x}^1$ that always points towards (or away from) $\vec x$ and another vector field $F^2_{\vec x}$ that is constant and equal to $F(\vec x)$ .

3759344,The quotient scheme $X/\Gamma$ when $X$ is separated and every orbit is contained in an affine.,"I am trying to solve Problem II.4.7(a) of Hartshorne: The only candidate I can think of for $X_0$ would be the quotient scheme $X/\sigma$ . If it exists, it must be unique by the usual argument. First starting with the affine case, taking $A=\mathbb C[x_1,...,x_n]/I$ to be a finitely generated $\mathbb C$ -algebra, then the associated ring morphism that commutes with conjugation would leave us with the invariant algebra being $A^\sigma=\mathbb R[x_1,...,x_n]/\bar I $ where $\bar I$ is the real part of $I$ . Then here it follows that $\text{Spec}A^\sigma\times_\mathbb{R}\mathbb C=\text{Spec}A$ by just tensoring $A^\sigma\otimes_\mathbb{R}\mathbb C=A$ . For the general case, I found a helpful clue from Bosch's AG book.  Exercise 7.1.8 of Bosch says: Let $X$ be a scheme and $\Gamma$ a finite group of automorphisms. The quotient $X/\Gamma$ exists if there is a $\Gamma$ -invariant affine open cover of $X$ . Further,  if $X$ is separated, then the quotient $X/\Gamma$ exists if all the points in any $\Gamma$ -orbit are contained in an open affine. Since by assumption we have that any two points are in an open affine and our orbit has at most two points, this exercise will give us the existence of the quotient. But I want to prove it first. My idea is to first construct the scheme to be locally the invariant rings. That is, if $X=\bigcup_{i=1}^n\text{Spec}A_i$ , take $X/ \Gamma := \bigcup_{i=1}^n \text{Spec}A_i^{\Gamma}$ as a set. Since $X$ is separated, the intersection of any two affines is affine, and define $\text{Spec}A_{ij}:=\text{Spec}(A_i^\Gamma\otimes_\mathbb{C} A_j^\Gamma)=\text{Spec}A_i^{\Gamma}\cap \text{Spec}A_j^{\Gamma}$ , which I naively want to use to glue together. However, the cocycle condition is not necessarily satisfied since we don't seem to have an isomorphism here: $\text{Spec}A_{ij}\cap \text{Spec}A_{ik}=\text{Spec}(A_{ij}\otimes_\mathbb{C} A_{ik})$ , but $\text{Spec}A_{ji}\cap \text{Spec}A_{jk}=\text{Spec}(A_{ij}\otimes_\mathbb{C} A_{jk})$ , and $A_{ij}\neq A_{jk}$ , and from here I'm lost. A second idea is the following: let $U$ be an affine open, and since $\gamma\in\Gamma$ is an automorphism, then $\gamma(U)$ is affine. Then, since intersections of finitely many affines is affine in a separated scheme, we have that $\bigcap_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\gamma(U)$ is nonempty, affine, and $\Gamma$ -invariant. Since every orbit lies in some affine, then we have that open sets of this form actually form an open cover of $X$ . So this proves that the second part of the exercise, once we show the first part.","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'real-algebraic-geometry']"

3759453,"Bayesian statistics notation: ""$P(\text{event}|x)$"" vs ""$P(\text{event}|\theta, x)$""","Now I am  new to the subject so, having some rotational problems. My issues are - What is the meaning of $P(\text{good bus tomorrow}|x) $ and $P(\text{good bus tomorrow}|\theta, x)$ or what are the differences between these two? Why $ P(\text{good bus tomorrow}|\theta, x)= \theta$ ? Is it because, actually $ P(\text{good bus tomorrow}|\theta, x)= p(\theta)$ but in this case,  the probability of $\theta $ is $\theta$ , i.e. $p(\theta)=\theta$ ? Let me clarify what I am talking about. The problem on page $22$ of the text of Introduction to Bayesian Statistics by Brendon J. Brewer is written as following  - After moving to Auckland, I decided that I would take the bus to work
each day. However, I wasn’t very confident with the bus system in my
new city, so for the first week I just took the first bus that came
along and was heading in the right direction, towards the city. In the
first week, I caught 5 morning buses. Of these 5 buses, two of them
took me to the right place, while three of them took me far from work,
leaving me with an extra 20 minute walk. Given this information, I
would like to try to infer the proportion of the buses that are ""good"", that would take me right to campus. Let us call this fraction $\theta$ and we will infer $\theta$ using the Bayesian framework. Here, $\theta =2/5.$ For example, look the following image - Recall that, if there are $N$ repetitions of a ""random experiment"" and the ""success""
probability is $\theta$ at each repetition, then the number of ""successes"" $x$ . To get the likelihoods, we need to think about the properties of our experiment. In particular, we should imagine that we knew the value of $\theta$ and were trying to predict what experimental outcome (data) would occur. Ultimately, we want to find the probability of our actual data set (2 out of the 5 buses were ""good""), for all of our possible $\theta$ values. $P(\theta|x)$ is the posterior probability. It describes $\textbf{how certain or confident we
are that hypothesis $\theta$ is true, given that}$ we have observed data $x$ . Calculating posterior probabilities is the main goal of Bayesian statistics! $P(\theta)$ is the prior probability, which describes $\textbf{how sure we were that}$ $\theta$ was true,
before we observed the data $x$ . $P(x|\theta)$ is the likelihood. $\textbf{If you were to assume that $\theta$ is true, this is the
probability}$ that you would have observed data $x$ . $P(x)$ is the marginal likelihood. This is the probability that you would have observed data $x$ , whether $\theta$ is true or not. So, $P (\theta|x) = \frac{P (\theta) P(x|\theta)}{P (x)}$ The following part is an excerpt from the same text - In the Bayesian framework, our predictions are always in the form of
probabilities or (later) probability distributions. They are usually
calculated in three stages. First, you pretend you actually know the true value of the parameters,
and calculate the probability based on that assumption. Then, you do this for all possible values of the parameter $\theta$ (alternatively, you can calculate the probability as a function of $\theta$ ). Finally, you combine all of these probabilities in a particular way to
get one final probability which tells you how confident you are of
your prediction. Suppose we knew the true value of $\theta$ was $0.3$ . Then, we would
know the probability of catching the right bus tomorrow is $0.3$ . If
we knew the true value of $\theta$ was $0.4$ , we would say the
probability of catching the right bus tomorrow is 0.4. The problem is, we don’t know what the true value is. We only have the
posterior distribution. Luckily, the sum rule of probability (combined
with the product rule) can help us out. We are interested in whether I will get the good bus tomorrow. There
are $11$ different ways that can happen. Either $\theta=0$ and I get
the good bus, or $\theta=0.1$ and I get the good bus, or $\theta=0.2$ and I get the good bus, and so on. These 11 ways are all mutually
exclusive. That is, only one of them can be true (since $\theta$ is
actually just a single number). Mathematically, we can obtain the posterior probability of catching
the good bus tomorrow using the sum rule: $$P(\text{good bus tomorrow}|x) = \sum_{\theta} p(\theta|x) \times P(\text{good bus tomorrow}|\theta, x) $$ $$=  \sum_{\theta} p(\theta|x) \times \theta$$ This says that the total probability for a good bus tomorrow (given
the data, i.e. using the posterior distribution and not the prior
distribution) is given by going through each possible $\theta$ value, working out the probability assuming the $\theta$ value you are considering is true, multiplying by the probability (given the data)
this $\theta$ value is actually true, and summing. In this particular problem, because $P\text{(good bus  tomorrow}|\theta, x) = θ$ , it just so happens that the probability for
tomorrow is the expectation value of $\theta$ using the posterior
distribution. To three decimal places, the result for the probability tomorrow is $0.429$ . Interestingly, this is not equal to $2/5 = 0.4$ .","['statistics', 'statistical-inference', 'proof-explanation', 'bayesian', 'notation']"
3759464,Is it true that $\operatorname{meas}(\partial(\operatorname{supp}(f)))=0$?,"Let $\Omega$ be a open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $C_c^{m}(\Omega)$ the space of $m$ -times continuously differentiable functions with compact support with $0 \leq m \leq \infty$ . Denote by $\partial X$ the boundary of the set $X$ and  by $\operatorname{meas}(X)$ the measure of the set $X$ . My question: Is it true that $\operatorname{meas}(\partial(\operatorname{supp}(f)))=0$ for all $f \in C_c^{m}(\Omega)$ ? Intuitively it seems true. For example, if $n=1$ then $\partial(\operatorname{supp}(f))$ has two points. If $n=2$ , then $\partial(\operatorname{supp}(f))$ looks like a deformed circumference. But I do not know how to give an analytical proof of this fact. Observations: The support of $f$ is the set $\operatorname{supp}(f)=\overline{\{x \in \Omega:f(x) \neq 0\}}^{\Omega}$ . Here $\operatorname{meas} (X)=0$ can be the Lebesgue measure or prove that for all $\varepsilon>0$ there is a sequence of $d$ -dimensional cubes $C_1, C_2, \dots, C_i, \dots$ such that $\operatorname{supp}(f) \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} C_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \operatorname{vol} C_i<\varepsilon.$","['measure-theory', 'smooth-functions', 'real-analysis']"
3759467,Combinatorics With Relations,"The twelvefold way offers a framework for counting functions, under various conditions which can be expressed as n-fold Cartesian Products of the function's domain, function, and codomain attributes.

3759499,Brezis-Kato regularity argument - Some questions about Struwe's proof,"The following is in Appendix B of Struwe's Variational Methods Let $u$ be a solution of $-\Delta u = g(x, u(x))$ in a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^N$ , $N \geq 3$ , where $g$ is a Carathéodory function with subcritical superlinear growth. Theorem :
Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^N$ be a smooth open set  and let $g: \Omega \times \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be a Carathéodory function such that $$
|g(x, u(x))| \leq a(x)(1 + |u(x)|) \quad \text{ a.e. in } \Omega
$$ for some $0 \leq a \in L_{loc}^{N/2}(\Omega)$ . Let $u \in H^1_{loc}(\Omega)$ be a weak solution to $-\Delta u = g(x, u)$ . Then $u \in L^q_{loc}(\Omega)$ for all $1 < q < \infty$ . If $u \in H_0^1(\Omega)$ and $a \in L^{N/2}(\Omega)$ , then $u \in L^q(\Omega)$ for all $1 < q < \infty$ . The proof begins as follows: Take $\eta \in C_c^\infty(\Omega)$ , $s \geq 0$ and $L \geq 0$ and let $$
\varphi = u \min \{|u|^{2s}, L^2\} \eta^2 \in H_0^1(\Omega)
$$ Testing the equation against $\varphi$ yields $$
\int_\Omega |\nabla u|^2 \min\{|u|^{2s}, L^2\} \eta^2 \ dx + \frac s2 \int_{\{|u|^s\leq L \}} |\nabla(|u|^2)|^2 |u|^{2s - 2} \eta ^2 \ dx \leq \\
-2 \int_\Omega \nabla u u \min \{|u|^{2s}, L^2\} \nabla \eta \eta \ dx + \int_\Omega a(1 + 2|u|^2)\min \{|u|^{2s}, L^2\}\eta^2 \ dx. 
$$ Why is $\varphi \in H_0^1(\Omega)$ ? How do the second term in the left-hand side of the inequality arises? I tried the following: We want to compute $$
\int_{\{|u|^s \leq L\}} \nabla u u \nabla |u|^{2s} \eta^2 \ dx .
$$ But $$
\nabla |u|^{2s} = \nabla(u^+ - u^-)^{2s} = 2s |u|^{2s - 1} \nabla |u|
$$ so we get $$
\int_{\{|u|^s \leq L\}} \nabla u u \nabla |u|^{2s} \eta^2 \ dx =
2s \int_{\{|u|^s \leq L\}} (\nabla u \nabla |u|) u |u|^{2s - 1} \eta ^2 \ dx 
$$ On the other hand, $$
\frac s2 \int_{\{|u|^s \leq L\}} |\nabla |u|^2|^2 |u|^{2s - 2} \eta^2 \ dx = \frac s2 \int_{\{|u|^s \leq L\}} |2 |u| \nabla |u||^2 |u|^{2s - 2} \eta^2 \ dx \\
= 2s \int_{\{|u|^s \leq L\}} |\nabla |u||^2 |u|^{2s} \eta ^2 \ dx.
$$ How to conclude that these two expressions are the same? Also, what is the intuition for the proof of this theorem? It is seeming like just a lot of calculations.
