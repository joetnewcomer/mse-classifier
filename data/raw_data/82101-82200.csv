1070756,Sizes of Hamming balls on the discrete torus,"Consider the discrete torus $\mathbb Z^2_k $, with $k$ even, i.e. the graph with vertex set $\{0,1,\dots, k-1\} \times \{0,1,\dots, k-1\}$ and edges between any pair of vertices which differ in exactly one coordinate by $1$ (modulo $k$). Denote by $d(0,v)$ the graph distance on $\mathbb Z^2_k $ between the origin, that is the vertex of coordinate $(0,0)$ and the vertex $v$. Let $B_r$ be the Hamming ball of radius $r$ centered at the orgin, defined as
$$
B_r:=\{ v \in \mathbb Z^2_k ~:~d(0,v) \leq r\},
$$
and denote by $b(r):=|B_r|$ its cardinality. Is there a way to characterize/describe/compute the sequence $b(1),\dots,b(k)$? If $r<k/2$, then the toroidal boundary has no effect on the Hamming balls and thus $b(r)=1+4 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^r i$.

1070853,Geometrical calculation to determine size difference between two rectangles when rotating one,"I've asked a programming question on StackOverflow here which should give you a good understanding why I'm trying to do this. I'm asking it here because it's now down entirely to the mathematics of the calculation. I've got two rectangles: a ""crop"" rect and an ""image"" rect that are on top of each other. I've designed it so that either both widths or both heights of each will start out the same (e.g. if they are landscape rectangles, regardless of width, the height of both will be the same). When rotating the image rect, the crop rect stays the same size, but I need to mathematically calculate how much to enlarge the image rect so that it always completely fills the crop rect. (The .gif in my linked question illustrates this rather well). Known values: The size and coordinates of each rect before rotation The size of the bounding rect that the rotated image rect fits into The angle of rotation in radians How, based on the degree of rotation (radians), and the size of each rectangle, can I calculate the difference in scale required to enlarge the image rect to fit entirely inside the crop rect when rotating it?","['geometry', 'rectangles', 'rotations']"

(6 answers) Closed 6 years ago . I ran across this problem in my Analysis class and can't seem to come up with a good solution. Here's the question: Show that if $\lim_{x\to a}f'(x) = A$ then $f'(a)$ exists and equals $A$. $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. I tried applying the Mean Value theorem like this:
There exists a $c \in (a, x)$ st $f(x)-f(a)=f'(c)(x-a) \implies \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=f'(c) \implies f'(a)=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=\lim_{c\to a}f'(c)=A$ However, I think this is wrong.

1071001,A question on the relation of the Galois group as field automorphisms and the Galois group as permutations of roots,"Let $f\in K[X]$ be a monic separable polynomial and $L$ a splitting field of $f$. Let $M=\{l_1,\ldots,l_n\}$ be the set of roots of $f$ in $L$, i.e.
$$

$$

h: Gal(L/K) & \to &\Sigma(M)\\

In interpreted this as the following statement: The image of $h$ consists exactly of the permutations $\sigma\in\Sigma(M)$ such that for each polynomial $g\in K[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ with the property that $g(l_1,\ldots,l_n)=0$ holds, the statement $g(\sigma(l_1),\ldots,\sigma(l_n))=0$ is also true.

1071261,How the cardinality of $\mathbb{R^+}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ same?,"Let me first confirm you that this question is not a duplicate of either this , this or this or any other similar looking problem. Here in the current problem I'm asking to disprove me(most probably I'm wrong). As you can see in this problem as answered by Nicolas that if a map is from $A \to B$ and is bijective then the cardinality of $A$ and $B$ is same. Logarithmic map is from $\mathbb{R^+} \to \mathbb{R}$ and it is a bijective map and therefore it implies that the cardinality of $\mathbb{R^+}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ is same. My logic We can rewrite $\mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R^-} \cup \{0\} \cup \mathbb{R^+}$ Now we can see that $\mathbb{R}$ has all the elements of $\mathbb{R^+}$ and over that it has {0} and elements of $\mathbb{R^-}$. Now using pigeonhole principle , if we pair each element of $\mathbb{R^+}$ to itself from $\mathbb{R^+} \to \mathbb{R}$ (eg. 5.124 is paired to 5.124 and so on) now when the pairing gets over then you have elements of $\mathbb{R^-}$ which have not been paired. Now one can say that since they are infinite sets therefore we cannot talk about pairing as I did above. When we are dealing with the pigeonhole principle then at that time it is not necessary to know the exact numbers involved. Now whatever method you use for pairing you will always end with some elements of $\mathbb{R}$ which have not been paired (acc to pigeonhole principle). Most probably I'm wrong but how?.

What are few examples of parallelizable manifolds of dimension at least ? What is an example which is compact? What are some nonparalleizable ones?

I am a total beginner with these smooth manifold things, so any help or references to a book that can help answer my quetsions would be greatly appreciated! Some thoughts so far. I give some examples in $\mathbb{R}^3$. A cylinder is certainly paralleizable by taking vector fields $X_1$ constant, parallel to the direction of the axis and $X_2$ constant, pointing around the circumference of the cylinder. Another example is a torus; take vector fields $X_1$ constant, pointing along the circumference of the ""big circle"" and $X_2$ constant, looping in and out of the ""donut hole."" The torus is compact, and the cylinder is also compact if it is finite. As for nonparallelizable manifolds $S^2$ is an example; any attempt to parallelize $S^2$ leads to points on the sphere at which the vector field cannot be nonzero, which isn't good if we want to get the tangent spce at those points by combining tangent vectors from the vector fields.

What I did: I noticed that if we have 6 consecutive successes, then the first success in our winning streak can be anywhere from the first experiment to the 194'th experiment. So when you think about it, we can have first 6 coin flips successful, and then whatever. or we can have first flip failure, and then 6 successes, and then whatever, or we can have 2 failures and then 6 successes and then whatever, and so on. When you sum it all up, it looks like $S=(\frac{1}{2})^6+\frac{1}{2}*(\frac{1}{2})^6+(\frac{1}{2})^2*(\frac{1}{2})^6+...+(\frac{1}{2})^{193}*(\frac{1}{2})^6$ This is a geometric series, with $a_1=(\frac{1}{2})^6$, $n=194$, $q=\frac{1}{2}$.

1071650,Max flow min cut from duality,"I have been having some trouble deriving the max flow min cut theorem from duality, which I was told is possible.  To begin with, I need to cast the problem into the form ""maximize $\langle c, x\rangle$ subject to the constraint $Ax\le b$ and $x\ge0$.  This needs to be done in such a way so that the dual of this LP, i.e. minimize $\langle b, x\rangle$ subject to the constraints $A^t y\ge c$, and $y \ge 0$, ""is"" the min cut problem. Of course, it is not literally the min cut problem, being a problem lying within a Euclidean space.  But it's not even that there exists a bijection between the set of feasible points for this second (dual) problem and min cut that preserves the ordering on the objective values.  In fact, min cut is an optimization problem over finitely many points, namely $2^{|V|}$ of them.  A friend told me what may be intended is that the vertices of the polytope constituting the feasible region are in bijection with the cuts.  Optimal values must occur on vertices.  Even if so, this seems only as much of an equivalence as saying ""they're equivalent because the optimal values are always the same."" But even this weak ""equivalence"" is one I cannot see.  Choose an enumeration $e_1, \dots, e_{|E|}$ of the edges in a graph $V(G), E(G)$ and an enumeration of the vertices $v_1, \dots, v_{|V|}$.  Max flow will be identified with the LP I construct below with the map associating each flow to a vector in Euclidean space of dimension $|E|$  I will use this identification freely without further remark.)  $c(e)$ are the capacities, $s, t$ the source and sink respectively, $h(e)$ the head and $t(e)$ the tail of an edge. To start with, I force ""max flow"" into the form above by defining a vector $c:=\sum_{e:t(e)=s}1_{e}-\sum_{e:h(e)=s}1_{e}$.  Then I take $A=(a_{ie})$ where $e\in E$ and for $1\le i \le |E|$ we have $a_{ie}=\delta_{e_ie}$, for $|E|<i\le |E|+|V|-2$ we have $a_{ie}=1$ if $e$ points away from $v_{i-|E|}$, $-1$ if it points towards, and $0$ otherwise.  Then we set the rest of the $a_{ie}=-a_{i-|V|+2\,e}$.  We set $b$ to be the capacities in the first $E$ slots and then $0$ after that. Effectively, I use $|E|$ dimensions to write the constraints of capacity, and then $|V|-2$ dimensions to write the constraints of flow in one inequality, and the rest for the other inequality.  I don't see where to go now.  Particularly, the reason I believe I am stuck is manyfold, but mainly because once I transpose $A$ I get $|E|$ constraints, and I have no idea why that polytope even determines $2^{|V|}$ vertices.","['graph-theory', 'linear-algebra', 'linear-programming', 'combinatorics']"

Now a point on the surface of the resulting sphere is defined as: $\vec P(\vec x) = (R + s \cdot f(\vec x)) \cdot \vec x$ where $R$ and $s$ are constants for the radius and the modulation depth, respectively. The question now: Is this information sufficient to calculate the surface normal to the point $\vec P$? I feel like this should be possible, but it is entirely possible that it is not. More information: The function in my case is 3D Simplex Noise which gives values on the range $(-1,1)$ for any $\vec x$. The values for $R$ are about 10 times larger than those of $s$, probably more. Maybe this helps if only an approximation is possible. UPDATE: Yes, it is possible, though there is still some error in here: Calculate the gradient: $\vec g = \nabla f(\vec x)$ Then project it into the tangent plane to the sphere passing through the point:
$\vec h = \vec g - (\vec g \cdot \vec x)\vec x$ The normal can then be calculated as
$\vec n = \vec x - s \cdot \vec h$ This works as long as the radius is $R=1$ and something like $s \ll R$. I think for $R \ne 1$ the gradient has to be rescaled: $\vec g = \dfrac{1}{R} \nabla f(\vec x)$ But I have no idea why the error gets larger with increasing $s$. UPDATE 2: Alright, the rescaling factor was only half complete $\vec g = \dfrac{\nabla f(\vec x)}{R + s \cdot f(\vec x)}$ Now it works for all $R$ and $s$. Here is an image to give some intuition what this thing looks like (with approximated normals).","['geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'differential-geometry']"

My Research: After a moment of thought, I realized there wasn't one, since we could merely compose it with itself or square it or tack a factorial on the end or do any number of other things. But I was still curious, so I took to the internet and was able to find things like the Ackerman Function and the Fast-growing Hierarchy on Wikipedia. These functions are cool and all, but, as far as I can tell, they don't serve a purpose other than being functions that increase really quickly. So this led to my question...

Here's what I know: Best case scenario all 10 bad eggs go into 1 basket, giving me 9 good baskets out of 10. Worst case is each basket carries 1 bad egg giving me 0 good baskets. Probability of any one basket being good, p, is 0.90^10=0.349. Mean number of good baskets would be 10*0.349=3.49? However this calculation assumes replacements, or at least requires large number of baskets/eggs to be a good approximation. Every good basket created decreases the probability that the next basket(s) will be good. For large numbers of eggs, say 50,000, is the non-replacement a big issue?

I define my $\mathrm{am}(t|k)$ as the inverse to the integral $$\int_0^t (1-k^2 \sin^2x)^{-1/2} \, \mathrm{d}x  = \mathrm{am}^{-1}(t|k) $$ And I'm interested in the special case of $k^2 = 2$ I understand the Jacobi elliptic functions to be defined as parametrising the ellipse $$x^2 + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$ and $k^2 = 1-b^{-2}$ . Then parametrise the ellipse by $x = \mathrm{cn}(t|k)$ , $y = b \,\mathrm{sn}(t|k)$ . In the special case of $k = 0$ it's simple to show that the ellipse becomes a circle, and these functions reduce to standard trig functions, and for $k = 1$ that the ellipse becomes two parallel lines, and that the elliptic functions reduce to $\tanh$ and $\mathrm{sech}$ . Now let $b = i \beta$ , and the ellipse becomes a hyperbola. $k^2 = 1 + \beta^2$ , and the special case of $\beta = 1$ is the rectangular hyperbola $$x^2 - y^2 = 1$$ This corresponds to $k^2 = 2$ , so my claim is that it should be possible to solve the integrals for the elliptic functions in this case to give $$ \mathrm{sn}(t|\sqrt{2}) = \sinh(t)$$ $$ \mathrm{cn}(t|\sqrt{2}) = \cosh(t)$$ Which would then agree with the parametrisation of the original ellipse equation, with $b = i$ However the defining integral reduces to $$\int_0^t \sqrt{\sec(2x)} \, \mathrm{d}x  = \mathrm{am}^{-1}(t|\sqrt{2}) $$ Which I don't believe to be integrable in terms of non-special functions.

To see this, define an equivalence relation on the unit sphere $S^2\subset\mathbb R^3$ by $p\sim q$ iff $q=\pm p$ . The quotient space (the set of equivalence classes is called the real projective plane and is denoted by $$\mathbb RP^2:=S^2/\{\pm1\}.$$ It is equipped with the quotient topology, i.e. a subset $U\subset\mathbb RP^2$ is open, by denfinition, iff its premiage under the obvious projection $S^2\to\mathbb RP^2$ is an open subset of $S^2$ . Now the map $f:S^2\to\mathbb R^6$ defined by $$f(x,y,z):=(x^2,y^2,z^2,yz,zx,xy)$$ descends to a homeomorphism from $\mathbb RP^2$ onto $M$ .

1072167,How do I follow part of this simple proof that $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} (a_n b_n) = a b$?,"I'm working through some analysis textbooks on my own, so I don't want the full answer. I'm only looking for a hint on this problem. In Rosenlicht's Introduction to Analysis , he proves, in a few short steps, that if $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} a_n = a$ and $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} b_n = b$, then $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} (a_n b_n) = a b$. Although I'm able to follow parts of the proof, there's one nexus I'm having trouble understanding. His steps (up until I get stuck) are: Start with the fact that all convergent sequences are bounded to get a number $M > 0$ such that $|a_n| < M$ and $|b_n| < M$. My work: This is saying that the sequences of points $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ are contained in the open ball centered at 0 with radius $M$. I understand this because if I pick any $\epsilon > 0$, the fact that the sequence $\{a_n\}$ converges to $a$ means that $\exists N \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $|a - a_n|< \epsilon$ whenever $n > N$. Then $\{a_n\}$ is contained in the closed ball of radius $r_a = \max\{\epsilon, |a - a_1|, |a - a_2|, \dots, |a - a_N|\}$ centered at $a$. The same holds true for $\{b_n\}$ and $b$, which gives me some $r_b$ for any $\epsilon > 0$. Then, I can pick $r = \max\{d(0, a)+r_a, \ d(0, b)+r_b\} = \max\{|a|+r_a, \ |b|+r_b\}$ so all points in $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ the closed ball centered at 0 with radius $r \geq 0$. I can then pick some real number $M > r$, which completes this step of the proof. Since a closed ball is a closed set, the preceding theorem implies $|a|, |b| \leq M$. My work: This is the step I don't understand. The preceding theorem states that if $S$ is a subset of the metric space $E$, then $S$ is closed if and only iff, whenever $p_1, p_2, \dots, $ is a sequence of points of $S$ that is convergent to $p$ in $E$, we have $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} p_n = p \in S$. I think this is how this step follows, but I'm not sure. Since the points in $\{a_n\}$ are contained in the closed ball $B_a$ centered at 0 with radius $r^*_a = d(0, a)+r_a = |a| + r_a$, and since an earlier proposition proved that a closed ball is a closed set, we have $a \in B_a$ by the theorem above. Since $a$ is in the closed ball centered at 0 with radius $r^*_a$ and by construction, $M > r^*_a$, we know that $a$ is also in the closed ball centered at 0 with radius $M$, so $|a| \leq M$. The same holds true for $|b|$. Is my logic correct?","['real-analysis', 'limits']"

Note that isometric must be overlapping pieces of charts only; however, mapping from charts to manifold can be arbitrary non-linear function. I know such manifolds exist. For example: Trivial example: a graph of a differentiable function is such manifold. A circle: I can construct an atlas of two charts: upper and lower parts that overlap by $\varepsilon$. Since charts overlap by intervals of equal length $\varepsilon$, I can build isometric transition map. A 2D torus ($\mathbb{T}^2$): I can build 4 charts that overlap by small rectangles. These rectangles can be made isometric to one another. Also, places where all 4 charts overlap can be made isometric as well. This construction seems to fail for a 2D sphere. So, I'm wondering which class of n-dimensional differentiable manifolds satisfies given constraints on differential structure? EDIT: In mathematical terms: Which differentiable manifolds allow
  differential structure
  $\big\{\big(\phi_\alpha, U_\alpha\big)\big\}_{\alpha \in \mathcal{A}}$
  such that: $\forall \alpha, \beta \in \mathcal{A}$, 
  if $U_\alpha \bigcap U_\beta \not= \emptyset$, then the restriction
  $\phi_\alpha \circ \phi^{-1}_\beta\big|_{\phi_\beta (U_\alpha \cap U_\beta)}$
  is an isometric map between sets $\phi_\beta (U_\alpha \cap U_\beta)$ and
  $\phi_\alpha (U_\alpha \cap U_\beta)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$? Note that neither $\phi_\alpha$ nor $\phi_\beta$ need not be
  isometric maps. Also note that $U_\alpha$ and $U_\beta$ need not be
  isometric to each other as well.","['manifolds', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
1072187,How to solve this questions about regular surfaces?,"I'm trying to solve the following: $i)$ Show that if all normals to a connected surface pass trough a fixed point, the surface is contained in a sphere. $ii)$ Prove that if a regular surface $S$  meets a plane $P$ in a single point $p$, then this plane coincides with the tangent plane of $S$ at $p$. $iii)$ Let $S\subset \mathbb{R^3}$ be a regular surface and $P\subset \mathbb{R^3}$ be a plane. If all points of $S$ are on the same side of $P$, prove that $P$ is tangent to $S$ at all points of $P\cap S$. The second one is intuitive but I don't know how to proceed. For the other two I have to say that I don't know how to start. I'll appreciate any help.","['surfaces', 'differential-geometry']"

It is not mentioned specifically in Partitio Numerorum III. This conjecture is usually expressed as $$\pi(x+y)\leq \pi(x)+\pi(y). $$ in which $\pi(x)$ is the number of primes not exceeding $x.$ See, for example, Mathworld's note.","['math-history', 'reference-request', 'number-theory']"
