1662498,Determining the bounds for a triple integral?,"I need help with a triple integration problem. I don't need help actually integrating this thing, I just need help with setting the actual integral(s) up. Specifically, I dont know how to determine what the bounds are. We basically have a 3D donut. The problem says we can model the donut as a torus centered at the origin (0,0,0) with outer radius R=4 and inner radius r=2. The points (x,y,z) inside the torus are described by the following condition: Equation Link Here, c is the radius from the origin to the center of the torus tube (so I think it's 3), and a is the radius of the donut tube (so I think it should be 1), the cross section of the donut tube is a circle. I need to calculate the volume of the donute after 2 cuts. The first cut happens parallel to the x axis at y = -3, and then parallel to the y axis at x = 1. So far, I set up the following integral (in polar coordinates) that I think represents the volume of the whole donut: Integral Eq But I dont know how to subtract the cuts? I'm assuming I need two more integrals that have to be subtracted from the whole volume, but I cant set it up. Can anyone help? Is the volume I have correct so far?","['volume', 'calculus', 'multivariable-calculus', 'integration', 'geometry']"
1662502,Jensen's inequality in measure theory,"Here cites its original claim from http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~ostrover/Teaching/18125.pdf . Theorem 3.1 Jensen's Inequality Let $(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ be a probability space (a measure space with $\mu(X) = 1)$ , $f: X \to \mathbb R \in L^1(X, \mu)$ , and $\psi: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be a convex function, then $$\psi\int_X f d\mu \le \int_X (\psi \circ f)d\mu$$ . Proof: Since $\psi$ is convex, at each $x_0 \in \mathbb R$ , there exist $a,b \in \mathbb R$ such that $\psi(x_0) = ax_0 + b$ and $\psi(x) \ge ax + b, \forall x \in \mathbb R$ , (here, $y = ax + b$ defines a supporting plane of the epigraph of $\psi$ at $x_0$ ). Let $x_0 = \int_X fdµ$ , then we have $$\psi(\int_Xf d\mu) = \psi(x_0) = ax_0+b=a\int_Xf\mu + b = \int(af+b)d\mu \le \int(\psi\circ f)d\mu$$ , q. e. d. Generally I have two questions. First is how could the $a, b$ be guaranteed to exist? The other is if the $\mu$ is not from probability space and just Lebesgue measure or even general measure, will this Jensen inequality still hold (I think the requirement is $\mu$ should be finite measure at least)?","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'convex-analysis']"
1662503,Integrate $\int\frac{\sin(2x)}{2+\cos x} dx$,"$$\int\frac{\sin(2x)}{2+\cos x} dx $$ Attempt: let $u = 2 + \cos x$. Then $du = -\sin x$. As we can see, $u - 2 = \cos x$, and $\sin(2x) = 2\sin x\cos x$. Using the change of variables method, we see that $$\int\frac{\sin(2x)}{2+\cos x} dx = -2 \int(u-2)\frac{1}{u}du = -2 \int 1 - 2\frac{1}{u} du = -2 (u - 2\ln u) + C$$ After substituting for $u$, I get $4 \ln(2+ \cos x) - 2\cos x - 4 + C$. According to Wolfram Alpha, the solution is $4 \ln(2+ \cos x) - 2\cos x + C$.

1662520,Bayesian Expected loss integral,"Thanks. I don't understand how to calculate the integral for a Bayesian Expected Loss. The problem is from Berger 1985 Stat Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis page 8. Example 1. Assume no data is obtained, so that the believed distribution of $\theta_2$ is simply $\pi(\theta_2)=10 I_{0.1,0.2} (\theta_2) d\theta_2$

$$\rho (\pi^*, a)=E^{\pi^*} L(\theta,a)= \int_{\Theta} L(\theta,a) dF^{\pi^*} (\theta)  $$ $$=\int^a_0 2(a-\theta_2) 10 I_{0.1,0.2} (\theta_2)d\theta_2 +\int^1_a (\theta_2-a) 10 I_{0.1,0.2} (\theta_2)d\theta_2 $$

1662548,Determinate analytically the range of a given function,"Is there a general way to obtain analytically the range of a function? For instance, for the function $f(x)=4+\sqrt{x-3}$, I proceed as follows: If $y \in ran(f)$ then for some $x$, $4+\sqrt{x-3} = y$ then $y-4 = \sqrt{x-3}$ now since we only consider non negative values of the square root then $y-4 = \sqrt{x-3} \geq 0$ so $y \geq 4$ and $ran(f) = [4, \infty)$.

1662631,The magic of existential transfer,"Yesterday I finished grading the final exam in a course on infinitesimal calculus taught to 130 freshmen. One of the problems on the exam was to show that if a function $f$ is differentiable at $c\in\mathbb{R}$ and satisfies $f'(c)>0$ then there is a point $x>c$ such that $f(x)>f(c)$. One of the students provided an original solution. If $\alpha>0$ is infinitesimal then $st(\frac{f(c+\alpha)-f(c)}{\alpha})>0$ and it easily follows that $f(c+\alpha)-f(c)>0$. Hence the hyperreal $x=c+\alpha$ satisfies $f(x)>f(c)$ and therefore the following formula is satisfied over the hyperreals: $$(\exists x)\;f(x)>f(c).$$ Now by existential transfer the same formula holds over the reals. Therefore there exists $x\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)>f(c)$, QED. Are there additional examples of existential transfer at this level?","['nonstandard-analysis', 'logic', 'calculus']"
1662643,Estimation of probability distribution for alternating renewal process,"I am studying so-called alternating renewal process, and I have a question concerning estimation of on-time/off-time distributions. Settings Let $\{(Z_0,Y_0),(Z_1,Y_1),(Z_2,Y_2),...\}$ be a sequence of pairs of positive random variables in $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}=\{1,2,3,\cdots\}$, and assume that $Y_i$ and $Z_i$ are independent and identically distributed random variables whose associated distributions are $f_Y(m)$ and $f_Z(m)$, respectively. Also, let $t\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. Then, one can introduce $S_{Z;n},S_{Y;n}$ and $N_t$ by $$S_{Y;n}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}(Z_i+Y_i),\quad S_{Z;n}=S_{Y;n-1}+Z_n,\ where\ S_{Y;-1}:=0;$$$$N_t=\mathrm{card}(\{n|S_{Y;n}\in[0,t)\}).$$ Now, define two positive constant integers $t_0$ and $T$, and observe the process for $t\in[t_0,t_0+T]$. The observation procedure can be given as follows. (1) If $S_{Z;N_{t_0}}\le t_0$, define $Y_*$ by $Y_*=S_{Y;N_{t_0}}-t_0$, or otherwise, define $Z_*$ by $Z_*=S_{Z;N_{t_0}}-t_0$. (2) Similarly, if $S_{Z;N_{{t_0}+T}}< t_0+T$, define $Y_{**}$ by $Y_{**}=t_0+T-S_{Z;N_{{t_0}+T}}$, or otherwise define $Z_{**}$ by $Z_{**}=t_0+T-S_{Y;N_{t_0+T}-1}$. (3) We obtain a new sequence (hereafter ""subsequence"") $O=\{[(Z_*,Y_{N_{t_0}})\ or\ (0,Y_*)],(Z_{N_{t_0}+1},Y_{N_{t_0}+1}),(Z_{N_{t_0}+2},Y_{N_{t_0}+2}),\cdots,(Z_{N_{t_0+T}-1},Y_{N_{t_0+T}-1}),$$[(Z_{**},0)\ or\ (Z_{N_{t_0+T}},Y_{**})]\}$. Repeating this observation for independent $\{(Z_i,Y_i)\}$ sequences gives us ensemble of subsequences. Question Can we construct estimators of $f_Z(m)$ and $f_Y(m)$ (for $1\le m\le T$) from the subsequence $O$, or from the ensemble of subsequences? If yes, how can we do that? If no, what extra assumptions are needed (for example, what if we know $f_Z(m)\propto\exp(-m/\lambda)$, or how rapidly should $f_Z(m)$ and $f_Y(m)$ decay)? I appreciate that one can naively make a ""histogram"" of $Z_i$ and $Y_i$ by defining $p_Z(m)$ and $p_Y(m)$ as $$p_X(m):=\frac{\mathrm{card}\{n\in[N_{t_0},N_{t_0+T}-1]|X_n=m\}}{N_{t_0+T}-N_{t_0}}\ where\ X=Z,Y,$$ and that one can expect that $p_Z(m)$ and $p_Y(m)$ converge to $f_Z(m)$ and $f_Y(m)$ respectively in a limit of $T\rightarrow\infty$. However, if $T$ is finite, I suspect that the problem gets complicated for two reasons: (1) The process is censored by a window of finite length, and thus we have to compensate the missing intervals, (2) The denominator $N_{t_0+T}-N_t$ of $p_X(m)$ $(X=Z,Y)$ is also a random number and is sensitive to rare events of large $m$. Thus, I have no idea how I can appropriately estimate $f_Z(m),f_Y(m)$ so far. I would be grateful if you share your idea to tackle this problem, or you recommend me some literatures (if any) concerning this problem. Note My numerical experience with the case $f_Z(m)\propto m^{-6/5}\exp(m/\xi_{Z})$ and $f_Y(m)\propto \exp(m/\xi_{Y})$ with $\xi_{Y}\ll T$ tells me that the naive histogram over many realization, that is, estimating $p_X(m)$ from set of independent subsequences $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^M$ by $$p_X(m):=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^M\mathrm{card}\{n\in[N_{t_0;i},N_{t_0+T;i}-1]|X_n=m\}}{\sum_{i=1}^M(N_{t_0+T;i}-N_{t_0;i})}\ where\ X=Z,Y$$ underestimates $f_Z(t)$ (in particular $\xi_{Z}$) for $\xi_{Z}\sim T$. Meanwhile I have found that the two estimators shown below give us rather reasonable agreement with $f_Y(t)$: Calculating the sample probability for each realization $O_i(i=1,2,\cdots,M)$ and averaging over the ensemble; that is, $$q_X(m):=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\frac{\mathrm{card}\{n\in[N_{t_0;i},N_{t_0+T;i}-1]|X_n=m\}}{M(N_{t_0+T;i}-N_{t_0;i})}.$$ It should be noted that $q_X(m)$ itself does not satisfy normalization in general, that is, $\sum_{i=1}^{T-1}q_X(m)\ne 1$. Giving a correction to the forementioned histogram by multiplying $1/(1-m/T)$ for each $m$, considering that the interval of length $l$ is censored by the window (and therefore cannot be observed) with probability of approximately $m/T$, even if either of the edge of the interval is inside the window: $$r(m):=p_X(m):=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^M(\mathrm{card}\{n\in[N_{t_0;i},N_{t_0+T;i}-1]|X_n=m\}/(1-m/T))}{\sum_{i=1}^M\sum_{m=1}^T(\mathrm{card}\{n\in[N_{t_0;i},N_{t_0+T;i}-1]|X_n=m\}/(1-m/T))}.$$ Also, it seems to me that giving a rigorous estimation of the estimation is rather complicated task (e.g. E. E. Alvarez, Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference 131 , 209-229 (2005)), and thus I am wondering how we can evaluate the ""goodness"" of the heuristically constructed (approximate) estimators. Any suggestions or comments are gratefully appreciated.","['stochastic-processes', 'statistics', 'statistical-inference']"

However, the sequence described in this question is infinite, while my strings have all possible lengths. A bijection between the reals and infinite binary strings . The strings in this question are still infinite. Besides, they're binary. This question originates from my attempt to map all DNA sequences (4-encoded) to $[0,1]$. Then I was wondering if this question could be expanded to any $k$-encoded string. The basic idea was to consider every string as a decimal of base $k$. For example, suppose $X_4=\{0,1,2,3\}$, then string ""23102"" is mapped to 0.23102 (base 4), and string ""321"" is mapped to 0.321 (base 4). However, string ""23102"", ""231020"" and ""2310200"" will all be mapped to 0.23102 (base 4). This situation can be circumvented if the string is binary by adding one extra 1 after the string. For example, consider string ""01"" and ""010"". Transform them by adding the extra 1, and they become ""011"" and ""0101"". Then map them to 0.011 and 0.0101 (both base 2), respectively. This way works because every finite decimal of base 2 will necessarily end up with 1 (and infinite decimals don't have the problem above). But this trick doesn't work when the string is not binary ($k\ne2$).","['combinatorics', 'elementary-set-theory']"

1662861,Is it irrational?,"Suppose I generate a number $0 < x < 1$. In general, after the decimal point, the first digit is $1$, the second is $0$, the third is $1$, etc. However, every digit in position $n$ has a $1/n$ chance of being $2$ instead. The tenths place, for example, must have a $2$. The number might look like this: $$x = 0.221210101020101010101010101010121010101010101010101010101010...$$ (There are an infinite number of possible values of $x$. My question applies to any number in this set, excluding numbers where the digits begin to repeat interminably at a finite point, which has 0 probability of happening. Ex. not interested in 0.222222...) Such a number doesn't seem to be rational, because $2$ will continue to pop up, even as it becomes less frequent. However, as the position $n$ of a digit approaches infinity, the probability of that digit being $2$ approaches $0$. It seems that as $n$ goes to infinity (and there are an infinite number of digits), the digits approach rational behavior, for lack of a  better phrase. Would this number be irrational? Clarification: What I am asking is whether a number would be considered irrational if its digits ""approach repetition""; if they could be said to repeat interminably at infinity, but not at a finite point.","['number-theory', 'real-numbers', 'infinity']"
1662872,Number of ways of coloring projected faces of any hypercube,"EDIT: This is the concrete problem in its current state: How many ways are there of separating a figure consisting of $l$ layers of squares with connected vertices (as the one seen in Fig. 5, for which $l=4$) into faces, when one can only create faces between any four vertices along the edges? An attempt is shown in Fig. 6 for $l=3$. Original question: If we look at the 2D projection of the outline of a cube Fig 1. we can choose to see it as a normal person, Fig. 2 or we can choose to view it in a slightly more perverted way (so that the edge between green and orange faces is closest to the viewer): Fig. 3 Note that the number of different ways of seeing the cube corresponds to the number of different ways of completely covering (without overlap) the area of the projection by rectangular faces with four different vertices as corners. For an $n$-cube ($n \geq 2$), let us call this number $C_n$. As we have seen, $C_3=2$ and obviously $C_2=1$. What is the general expression for $C_n$? At first, when investigating the $4$-cube, I simply drew the projection of one seen at an angle and started constructing the combination tree (blue indicates that a branching choice was made to color that face - the ones in the same figure as the blue face are the ones that were determined as soon as the one in blue was chosen): Fig. 4 However, this was unsystematic and confusing, so I instead realized (hopefully this is true!)$^\dagger$ that I might as well represent it (and indeed any hypercube, by adding more layers) like this: Fig. 5 Let the edges of a square (as it is seen in Fig. 5) be one layer. There is then $1$ layer for a $2$-cube, $2$ for a $3$-cube, $4$ for a $4$-cube, and in general (since there are $2^n$ vertices in an $n$-cube and $4$ vertices in one layer) $2^{n-2}$ layers for an $n$-cube. The idea is now to find out how many new possibilities each layer introduces. Here are the possibilities for two and three layers (I've excluded the ones not unique under rotation and two adjacent faces with the same color is viewed as one face): Fig. 6 This is where I'm stuck: I'm having a hard time seeing the pattern in that there are two ways of having a total of two ""split"" faces in the three-layer case (fifth and sixth three-layer structure in Fig. 6), but only one way of having one, three or four split faces. And even if I knew how to deal with this, the task still seems daunting. Any help is much appreciated! $^\dagger$ There may be introduced some extra symmetries when drawing the cube as the ""inner"" cube in Fig. 4, so that the same object will have less possibilities that are unique under rotation, than when seen as in Fig. 6. This is an unfortunate choice in drawing style, but I believe that this discrepancy in possibilities (only one unique possibility of coloring the ""inner"" cube in Fig. 4) can be avoided if we draw the inner cube in Fig. 4 in two- or three-point perspective instead, so that ""the front"" surface is bigger than the ""back"" (or, which makes it count as two possibilities again, the other way around). If that is not the case, however, it will surely be impossible to order all possible scenarios under continuous rotation of any hypercube so as to be able to account for this effect, so let's focus our attention on the problem as it is given from Fig. 6, and not worry about how to interpret the final result.

Thanks a lot for answers. During my research on $P(n,d)$ , I got a conjecture. Thus the question has been going into very interesting points. 
(I do not know if it is known conjecture or not? Please let me know if you heard it. If it is true, this can let us to generalize The Fermat's Little theorem for any positive number. ) Fermat's little theorem:
$n^{p}\equiv n \pmod {p}$ where $p$ is prime number; $n$ is positive integer and $\gcd(n,p)=1$. My conjecture: $$n^{d}\equiv P(n,d) \pmod {d}$$ where $d$ and $n$ are any positive integers. The conjecture is true for the (7X7) table that @Markus Scheuer gave in his answer. All values in the table were tested with success. I need your contribution to test my conjecture for large numbers. I have not found any counter-example to disprove my conjecture yet. Note that I have the conjecture without proof. 
How can the conjecture be proven? I would like to share  some my results for $P(n,d)$ . Please let me know if any fault in my formulas below. $$P(n,1)=0$$ $$P(n,2)=n$$ $$P(n,3)=n$$ $$P(n,4)=n+\cfrac{n(n-1)}{2!}\cfrac{4!}{2!2!}=3n^2-2n$$ $$P(n,5)=n+\cfrac{n(n-1)}{1!}\cfrac{5!}{2!3!}=10n^2-9n$$ $$P(n,6)=n+\cfrac{n(n-1)}{2!}\cfrac{6!}{3!3!}+\cfrac{n(n-1)}{1!}\cfrac{6!}{4!2!}+\cfrac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}\cfrac{6!}{2!2!2!}$$ $$P(n,6)=n+25n(n-1)+15n(n-1)(n-2)=15n^3-20n^2+6n$$ $$P(n,7)=n+\cfrac{n(n-1)}{1!}\cfrac{7!}{4!3!}+\cfrac{n(n-1)}{1!}\cfrac{7!}{2!5!}+\cfrac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2!}\cfrac{7!}{3!2!2!}$$ $$P(n,7)=n+56n(n-1)+105n(n-1)(n-2)$$ Note that those formulas  above satisfy the $(7x7)$  (n/d) table that @Markus Scheuer gave in his answer. We can write more terms if we want. $$P(n,8)=n+\cfrac{n(n-1)}{1!}\cfrac{8!}{2!6!}+\cfrac{n(n-1)}{1!}\cfrac{8!}{3!5!} +\cfrac{n(n-1)}{2!}\cfrac{8!}{4!4!}+\cfrac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2!}\cfrac{8!}{2!2!4!}+\cfrac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2!}\cfrac{8!}{2!3!3!}+\cfrac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{4!}\cfrac{8!}{2!2!2!2!}$$ .. .. $$P(n,d)=n+\cfrac{n(n-1)}{1!}\cfrac{d!}{2!(d-2)!}+\cfrac{n(n-1)}{1!}\cfrac{d!}{3!(d-3)!} +\cfrac{n(n-1)}{1!}\cfrac{d!}{4!(d-4)!}+.....$$ $$n^{d}\equiv P(n,d) \pmod {d}$$ 
If we put the results on above in my conjecture , we can get: $$n^{2}\equiv n \pmod {2}$$ 
$$n^{3}\equiv n \pmod {3}$$ 
$$n^{4}\equiv 3n^2-2n \pmod {4}$$ 
$$n^{5}\equiv 10n^2-9n\pmod {5}\equiv -9n\pmod {5}\equiv n\pmod {5}$$ 
$$n^{6}\equiv 15n^3-20n^2+6n \pmod {6} \equiv 3n^3-2n^2 \pmod {6}$$ 
$$n^{7}\equiv n+56n(n-1)+105n(n-1)(n-2) \pmod {7}\equiv n \pmod {7}$$ 
$$n^{8}\equiv n^2(n-2)^2 \pmod {8}$$ EDIT: (2/22/2016) An observation: $$(n+1)^{d}=\sum_{k=0}^{d}{d\choose k}\>n^k$$ $$(n+1)^{d}\equiv \sum_{k=0}^{d}{d\choose k}\>n^k \pmod {d}$$ If $n^{d}\equiv P(n,d) \pmod {d}$ true; $$P(n+1,d)\equiv \sum_{k=0}^{d}{d\choose k}\>P(n,k) \pmod {d}$$ Because of ${d\choose d-1}=d$ $$P(n+1,d)\equiv P(n,d)+ \sum_{k=0}^{d-2}{d\choose k}\>P(n,k) \pmod {d}$$ This result is very similar result  with the recursion formula of @Christian Blatter wrote in his answer. $$P(n+1,d)=P(n,d)+\sum_{k=0}^{d-2}{d\choose k}\>P(n,k)\qquad(d\geq2)$$ EDIT I have tested my conjecture with big numbers. According to the table in sequence A231797 (Thanks a lot to @MarkusScheuer for the link) There is an output for big numbers Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..410 . I tested for $n=d=410$ $P(410,410)$ is 990 digits integer, you can see in the table that I gave in the link above. I confirmed in an online calculator that my conjecture is still true for that big number. $$410^{410}\equiv 0 \pmod {410}$$ $$P(410,410)\equiv 0 \pmod {410}$$ $$410^{410}\equiv P(410,410) \pmod {410}$$ Note: I have not tested my conjecture with big numbers for the case that $d \neq n$ . I do not know a generating function for the case $d \neq n$ as we have for $d=n$ as Markus Scheuer informed in his answer. Any idea for generating function for $d \neq n$? Generating function for $d = n$ \begin{align*}
P(n,n)=n![x^n]\left(e^x-x\right)^n\qquad\qquad n\geq 0
\end{align*} Thanks for helps and contributions EDIT (26/2/2016): I have posted a proof for my conjecture above. You can find it below as an answer. Please feel free to write comments on it. $$n^{d}\equiv P(n,d) \pmod {d}$$ where $d$ and $n$ are any positive integers. Many special thanks to @ChristianBlatter and @MarkusScheuer  for their contributions to prove it. Especially  Christian Blatter's recurrence formula for $P(n,d)$  is the key to prove the conjecture.

1662958,A probability theory question about independent coin tosses by two players,"Say Bob tosses his $n+1$ fair coins and Alice tosses her $n$ fair coins. Lets assume independent coin tosses. Now after all the $2n+1$ coin tosses one wants to know the probability that Bob has gotten more heads than Alice. The way I thought of it is this : if Bob gets $0$ heads then there is no way he can get more heads than Alice. Otherwise the number of heads Bob can get which allows him to win is anything in the set $\{1,2,\dots,n+1\}$. And if Bob gets $x$ heads then the number of heads that Alice can get is anything in the set $\{0,1,2,..,x-1\}$. So\begin{align}P(\text{Bob gets more heads than Alice})&= \sum_{x=1}^{n+1} \sum_{y=0}^{x-1} P( \text{Bob gets x heads }\cap \text{Alice gets y heads }) \\[0.2cm]&= \sum_{x=1}^{n+1} \sum_{y=0}^{x-1} \left(C^{n+1}_x \frac{1}{2}^{x} \frac{1}{2}^{n+1-x}\right)\left( C^n_y \frac{1}{2}^y \frac {1}{2}^{n-y}\right)\\[0.2cm]& = \sum_{x=1}^{n+1} \sum_{y=0}^{x-1} \frac{C^{n+1}_x C^n_y}{2^{2n+1}}\end{align} How does one simplify this? Apparently the answer is $\frac{1}{2}$ by an argument which looks like this, Since Bob tosses one more coin that Alice, it is impossible that they toss both the same number of heads and the same number of tails.
So Bob tosses either more heads than Alice or more tails than Alice (but not both).
Since the coins are fair, these events are equally likely by symmetry, so both events
have probability 1/2.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

Define the Grassmann functor as $\underline{Grass}(V,r):(Sch/k)^o \rightarrow (Sets)$ associating to any $k$-scheme $S$ of finite type the set of all subsheaves $K \subset \mathcal{O}_S \otimes V$ with locally free quotient $ F = \mathcal{O}_S \otimes V/K$ of rank $r$.

1663215,Showing that a function with a second-order zero at $m$ is sent to zero by the whole $T_mM$.,"I was given the following as an exercise. Prove that if $f\in\mathcal{C}^\infty(M)$ where $M$ is a manifold, $f(m)=0$ for some $m\in M$, and the zero is second-order, i.e. in some chart $\phi$ we have $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ with derivatives all zero, then all $v\in T_mM$ send $f$ to 0, i.e. $v(f)=0$ for all $v\in T_mM$. $T_mM$ was defined as the space of all tangent vectors, which were defined as follows. $v:\mathcal{C}^\infty(M)\to\mathbb R$ is a tangent vector at $m\in M$ if: It is linear, i.e. $v(\alpha f+\beta g)=\alpha v(f)+\beta v(g)$ for all $f,g\in\mathcal{C}^\infty(M)$; It satisfies the Leibniz rule, that is $v(fg)=f(m)v(g)+g(m)v(f)$ for all $f,g\in\mathcal{C}^\infty(M)$. In another course, tangent vectors were defined as linear functionals on germs satisfying Leibniz. So the domain of $v$ were not $\mathcal{C}^\infty(M)$, but a quotient of that, identifying all functions coinciding in a neighborhood of $m$. Unfortunately, no mention of germs was made in the definition of this course, so a priori I cannot say that if $f=g$ in a neighborhood of $m$, then $v(f)=v(g)$ for any $v\in T_mM$. My try would have been to use the well-known basis of $T_mM$, the derivative vectors. However: The exercise was given before proving those vectors are a basis, so it should be possible to do it without them; The exercise was used to prove those vectors are a basis, so it must be possible without them. Here is how the statement about derivative vectors was proved. Consider $D$ a derivation at $m$ acting on $\mathcal{C}^\infty(M)$. Then it induces a derivation at $m$ acting on $\mathcal{C}^\infty(U)$, where $U$ is any open set in $M$. That is because I can take $f\in\mathcal{C}^\infty(U)$ and extend it. This extension is done via a bump function $\rho\in\mathcal{C}^\infty(M)$ which is one in a neighborhood of $m$, zero outside $U$, and smooth all over $M$. We define $\hat D(f)$ to be $D(\rho f)$. As long as we choose $\rho$ as said above, the $\hat D$ will not depend on $\rho$, since any two extensions $\rho_1f,\rho_2f$ will coincide in a neighborhood of $m$, precisely where both $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ are equal to 1. If two functions coincide in a neighborhood of $m$, their difference has a second-order zero at $m$, hence, by the exercise, $D(\rho_1f-\rho_2f)=0$. If I choose $U$ to be the domain of a local chart $\phi$, I can expand $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ with a sort of Taylor expansion, then deduce a similar expansion for $f$, and finally deduce from that expansion that I can reconstruct any derivation at $m$ acting on $\mathcal{C}^\infty(U)$ via the particular derivations that map a function $f\in\mathcal{C}^\infty(U)$ to one of the derivatives of $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ at $\phi(m)$. But then any derivative acting on $\mathcal{C}^\infty(M)$ induces one on $\mathcal{C}^\infty(U)$, so I have a system of generators for $T_mM$. And oh well those generators are independent and thus a basis. So I cannot (AFAICS) go local in my exercise, because that would require inducing a tangent vector to $U$ from $v\in T_mM$, and that should be done by some extension of $f$ to $M$, and that would require well-posedness of the image of the extension, which, as seen above, was proved with the second-order thing, since clearly any two extensions of $f$ to $M$ coincide in the neighborhood $U$ of $m$. So how can I solve this problem? How can I prove either of the following two? The properties given for tangent vectors imply locality, i.e. that if $f=g$ in a neighborhood of $m$ then $v(f)=v(g)$ for all $v\in T_mM$.

$$\pi=\lim_{n\to\infty} n\sin \left(\frac{180}{n}\right)^o$$
I have been trying to rewrite the above expression without $sin$ in it explicitly. So, I researched other expressions for $sin$, and found this:
$$\sin (x) = x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!}+\frac{x^9}{9!}-\frac{x^{11}}{11!}+\cdots$$

1663453,Resolving threefold quotient singularities without the quotient,"Consider a threefold $X$ with an action by a finite group $G$, everything over $\mathbb{C}$. There are some fairly nice singularities that can occur in $X/G$. For example, suppose we have a transversal $A_1$ singularity, where it is known that blowing up the quotient gives a single fixed $\mathbb{P}^1$ bundle resolving the singularity. Moreover, this resolution is crepant. Instead of blowing up $X/G$, one can instead look at this fixed curve on $X$ in local coordinates, say $\mathbb{C}^3$ where the $x$-axis is the transversal $A_1$ singularity, and the action is (locally) given by $(0,-1,-1)$. One can blowup this $\mathbb{C}^3$, note that the exceptional divisor is fixed by the induced action and so there is now a fixed divisor. Hence, the quotient of this blowup by $G$ is smooth. Similarly we can do this for a transversal $A_2$, $A_3$, etc... as well as an isolated fixed point with (local) action given by $(\zeta_3,\zeta_3,\zeta_3)$ where $\zeta_3$ is a primitive third root of unity. This corresponds to a cone over a triple Veronese surface. When $X/G$ admits a crepant resolution, for example when $G\subset \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ by Bridgeland-King-Ried, is it always possible to blowup smooth local charts to get fixed divisors, so that after sufficiently many blowups the quotient is smooth, giving a crepant resolution? I am interested in more complicated actions, where the singular quotient is not such an easy thing to work with, whereas blowing up smooth $\mathbb{C}^3$ (or eventually $\mathbb{C}^n$) is quite doable! However, I have been trying and cannot seem to always get this to work. For a small example, let $G = \langle \zeta_6\times \zeta_3\times \zeta_2\rangle$ act on $\mathbb{C}^3$, where $\zeta_n$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity. The $y$-axis is a transversal $A_1$ singularity, while the $z$-axis is a transversal $A_2$ singularity, and these can be blown up to fixed divisors, but the point of intersection at the origin is fixed by the whole group, and every approach I take to blowing up the smooth $\mathbb{C}^3$ never gives me a fixed divisor corresponding to this point. My concern is that when dealing with the quotient $X/G$ you can do small resolutions, which do not show up on a smooth variety, and perhaps there is no way to get the same effect without taking the quotient first. For example, if we take the example above and blowup the $y$ and $z$ axes, we get
$$ \{ (x,y,z),[u:v] \mid xv = yzu \} $$
with a smooth affine $\{(y,z,\frac{u}{v}\}$ and a nodal chart $\{(x,y,z,\frac{v}{u} | x\frac{v}{u} = yz\}$. A small resolution of the node is given by blowing up $(x,z)$, say
$$ \{ (x,y,z,\frac{v}{u}),[a:b] \mid xb = za,\ x\frac{v}{u} = yz \}. $$
This has (smooth) affine charts $\{(z,\frac{v}{u},\frac{a}{b})\}$ and $\{(x,y,\frac{b}{a})\}$. Blowing up the $z$-axis on the 2 charts it appears, and contracting the $[u:v]$ bundle afterward would correspond to a crepant resolution of the transversal $A_1$ and $A_2$ singularities. However, there are only fixed points and fixed curves under $(\zeta_6,\zeta_3,-1)$, no fixed divisors, and I cannot see anyway to (crepant) resolve them. (The same issue occurs if we first blowup the origin, and then the transversal singularities.)",['algebraic-geometry']

1663531,"How exactly does writing $f(z)=f(z,\bar{z})$ work?","I know that we can just define the differential operators
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial z} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - i \frac{\partial}{\partial y})$$
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial}{\partial y})$$
and that $f$ is holomorphic means that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar{z}}=0$, that's all clear. However, what I don't get it is how we can write any arbitrary function $f(z)=f(z,\bar{z})$, and then calculate 'formally' with the above differential operators and expect the outcomes to be as expected (or even well defined). So this question is really not about the derivation/definition of the  Wirtinger Derivatives, that's all document very well. It's about why we can write for example \begin{align}
\frac{\partial (g\circ f)}{\partial z}&=\frac{\partial (g(f(z,\bar z),\bar f(z,\bar z))}{\partial z}\\\\
&=\left.\frac{\partial g(w,\bar w)}{\partial w}\right|_{w=f(z,\bar z)}\times \frac{\partial f(z,\bar z)}{\partial z}+\left.\frac{\partial g(w,\bar w)}{\partial \bar w}\right|_{\bar w=\bar f(z,\bar z)}\times \frac{\partial \bar f(z,\bar z)}{\partial z}\\\\
&=\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}\circ f\right)\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}+\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial \bar z}\circ f\right)\frac{\partial \bar f}{\partial z}
\end{align} (copied from here ). I just don't see how the formal definition of the Wirtinger derivatives makes it so that all of this goes through. An answer to this question would explain, rigorously, why the steps in the above calculation are justified, starting from the fact we can write $f(z)=f(z,\bar{z})$ in a well-defined way s.t. the operators $\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}}$ behave as expected.

Factoring $10^{900}-2^{1000} = 2^{900}(5^{450}+2^{50})(5^{225}+2^{25})(5^{225}-2^{25})$ reduces the problem to seeing if $997$ divides any of the above terms, but that didn't seem to help much either as again, the numbers involved are so large.

As it so happens, this claim turned out to be true which yields the desired result by setting $k=100$.  Giving him the claim as a clue, he was able to proceed. As it required proving a much stronger statement first and taking a stab in the dark, I wondered if this was indeed the intended solution or if there is something that I missed that yields the result a bit more easily. Is there a better/alternative way to prove this? Short version of my proof: Let $k=1$.  Then $10^{9}-2^{10} = 999998976=1994\cdot 501504$ so the base case holds. Assume claim holds for some $k\geq 1$.

If the maxima/minima occurs in the interior of $\Omega$, since $u_x = u_y = 0$ we get $\max u = \min u = 0 $, and so $u$ vanishes identically.

$$ f'(\theta) = -u_xy + u_yx = 0 \implies u_x = \lambda x; \, u_y = \lambda y $$ This is where I am stuck. To specify that this is a maxima and not a minima, we need to differentiate $f$ further.

Proof by the Well Ordering Principle. Let $d$ be the set of all such possible combinations in form $(a, b, c)$. By the Well Ordering Principle, we that every nonempty set of non-negative integers always has a smallest element. So, there must be a tuple $(a, b, c)$ such that $\max(a, b, c)$ is the least possible value in $d$. We also know that $a$, $b$ and $c$ must be even. Since $a$ must be even if $4c^3$ has to be even but we know that $4c^3$ is even, so $a$ is the same. Similarly it can be shown that all $a$, $b$ and $c$ are even. Now, let $a = 2x$, $b = 2y$ and $c = 2z$. But then, 
$$a^3 + 2b^3 = 4c^3$$
$$\implies (2x)^3 + 2*(2y)^3 = 4*(2z)^3$$
$$\implies 8x^3 + 16y^3 = 32z^3$$
$$\implies x^3 + 2y^3 = 4z^3$$ So, $(x, y, z) \in d$. But, $\max(x, y, z) < \max(a, b, c)$. But $(a, b, c)$ was supposed to be the smallest such member. We have a contradiction here. There is no smallest $(a, b, c)$ which satisfy this criterion and hence no $(a, b, c)$ at all and $d$ is empty. Hence, there exist no integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ which satisfy  $a^3 + 2b^3 = 4c^3$ I wrote this proof. Is it enough to prove the above question? Am I right? Are there any mistakes in the above proof? If there are any, please help me. Do you have any other ways of proving it?","['number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'proof-verification', 'elementary-number-theory']"
1664075,proof - if $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2xyz$ then $x = y = z = 0$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Integer solutions of the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2 = 2xyz$ (4 answers) Closed 8 years ago . Well, I have been trying to prove that: $$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2xyz \implies x = y = z = 0$$ and have made little progress. Till now, I have only been able to prove that if this is to happen then $x$, $y$ and $z$ must be even. I am explaining how I arrived to this result but don't know how to proceed further or even figuring this out would make sense. If $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2xyz$, then at least one of $x$, $y$ or $z$ must be a multiple of 2. Let that one number be x and now $2|x$. Also let $x = 2a$.Then, $4a^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4ayz$. Now assume that one of $y$ or $z$ is odd. So the other must be odd as well as odd and odd add upto even and we need an even number to make the equality true. But it can be proved that the sum of squares of two odd numbers is never a multiple of $4$ . Then the LHS would no longer be a multiple of 4 ($4a^2$ is a multiple of $4$ but $y^2 + z^2$ isn't) while the RHS would be. This is a contradition. Hence, $y$ and $z$ both are even. That's what I have been able to prove till now and still don't know if that is useful. Please help if you have an answer.","['number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'elementary-number-theory']"

$\textbf{Background}$:
This is part of a project to figure out how slowly the errors of power law distributed sums obey the law of large numbers. So it may not be necessary to find the logic of the sequence above, but these correspond to the exponent $\left\{{\alpha:\frac{MD(n)}{MD(1)}=\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^{1-\frac{1}{\alpha }}}\right\}$,where $MD(n)$ is the mean absolute deviation of an n-summed Student T distributed variable with tail exponent/degrees of freedom equal 3 (and a mean of $0$). Numerically we get $$\{1.70951,1.72741,1.73951,1.74855,1.7557,1.76158,1.76655,1.77084,1.7746,1.77795,1.78095,1.78367,1.78615,1.78843,1.79054,1.79249,1.79432,1.79602,1.79762,1.79913,1.80056,1.80191,1.80319,1.80441,1.80557,1.80669,1.80775,1.80877,1.80974\},$$

1664140,$4$ married couples and $2$ single men will sit at a circular table.,"$4$ married couples and $2$ single men sit at a circular table. In how many ways can they sit so that a man can't sit next to a woman who is not his wife? I have tried but I am not sure to the following answer : First, the husbands sit in the circular table of which the possible ways is $3!$. The wives should sit next to her husband which is only $1$ way. The two men can only be put between two husbands in only $2$ ways and they then can be permuted in $2$ ways. So the number of ways is $4$. By applying the multiplication principle, the total number of ways for this possibility is $3! \times 4$ = $24$. The second possibility is similar which is making the wives sit first and put each husband next to his own wife and then put the single men. The total number of ways is also $24$. So the answer is $24 + 24 = 48$.",['combinatorics']

1664222,The strong topology on $U(\mathcal H)$ is metrisable,"The strong operator topology on a Banach space $X$ is usually defined via semi-norms: For any $x \in X$, $|\cdot|_x: B(X) \to \mathbb R, A \mapsto \|A(x)\|$ is a semi-norm, the strong topology is the weakest/coarsest topology which makes these maps continuous. Alternatively it is generated by the sub-base $\left\{B_\epsilon(A;x)=\{B\in X \mid |B-A|_x<\epsilon\}\phantom{\sum}\right\}$. If we define this topology on a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ and restrict it to the subset of unitary operators, a statement in a book I am reading is that this is then a metrisable topology. My question is then, how can I prove this (especially, why do we need separability)? What does the metric look like (is it constructable)? When can this result be extended to other bounded subsets of $B(\mathcal H)$?","['functional-analysis', 'c-star-algebras', 'operator-theory', 'hilbert-spaces']"
1664242,Differentiation: Vectors or scalars,"As you know, we can geometrically interpret the set of all reals $\Bbb R$: every point on the line can be uniquely expressed by a real number x (it's coordinate). However, we could go a step further and use the line to geometrically express operations between real numbers, such as addition. In order for us to do this we introduce vectors and now every point on the line and every coordinate associated with that point represent a vector starting from the origin and ending at the given point. Thus every real number either represents a point on the line or a vector on the line. Now, in the definition of the derivative$$ \frac{{\rm d} }{{\rm d}x} y(x) =\lim_{h\rightarrow0} \frac{1}{h}( y(x+h)-y(x)) $$ we have x+h, which only makes sense geometrically if x and h are both vectors (addition of points on the line makes no sense). My question is: In order to have a meaningful definiton of the derivative, should the function y(x) be geometrically interpreted as mapping vectors to vectors?","['vectors', 'geometry']"

1664299,Convergence of zeta functions for schemes of finite type over the integers,"In his lecture ""Zeta functions and $L$-functions"", Serre presents a very elegant proof of the convergence of the zeta function 
$ \zeta (X,s) = \prod_{x \in |X|} (1- N(x)^{-s})^{-1}$ in the half plane $R(s) > dim(X)$, where $X$ is a scheme of finite type over $\mathbb{Z}$, $|X|$ the set of closed points of $X$ and $N(x)$ the number of elements in the residue field $k(x)$. He reduces the claim to the case where $X = Spec \, A[x_1, \ldots x_n]$ and $A$ is either $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{F}_p$. The decisive input is the following lemma: a) If $X$ is the finite union of the schemes $X_i$, and the claim holds for all $X_i$, then it holds for $X$. b) If $f: X \to Y$ is finite and the claim holds for $Y$, then it holds for $X$ as well. I've been trying to prove b) but I seem to be missing something. Here's what I've tried so far:
I was considering $\zeta(X,s) = \prod_{y \in |Y|} \zeta(X_y \, ,s)$, where $X_y$  is the fiber of $f$ at $y$. I now the fibers are finite but I don't know how to connect this with the fact that $\zeta(Y,s)$ converges. Is it true that the residue field $k(y)$ is a finite extension of $k(x)$ for all $x \in X_y$ (of degree $\deg f$)? I know this is the case for the function fields. Any help is very appreciated!","['zeta-functions', 'algebraic-geometry']"
