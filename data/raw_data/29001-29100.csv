269434,non-continuous function satisfies $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$,"As mentioned in this link , it shows that For any $f$ on the real line $\mathbb{R}^1$, $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$  implies $f$ continuous $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$  measurable. But how to show there exists such an non-measurable function satisfying $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$? I guess we may use the uniform bounded principal and the fact that $f$ is continuous iff it is continuous at zero under the above assumption.

269478,non constant bounded holomorphic function on some open set,"this is an exercise I came across in Rudin's ""Real and complex analysis"" Chapter 16.

Does there exist a non-constant bounded holomorphic function on $\Omega$? Especially, do this for $\Omega=[-1,1]$. Some observations: Suppose there exists such function $f$, then WLOG, we may assume $f$ has no zeros points in $\Omega$ by adding a large enough positive constant, then, $\Omega$ is simply-connected implies $\int_{\gamma}fdz=0$, for any closed curve $\gamma\subset \Omega$, how to deduce any contradiction?","['complex-analysis', 'analysis']"
269481,"Difference between fields $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]$? [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Closed 11 years ago . Possible Duplicate: Is $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) = \mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})$? How would one describe elements from $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]$? I was under the mistaken impression, that if $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]$ elements are $a+b\sqrt{2} \mid a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$, then  $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}]$ elements would be be $a+b(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}) \mid a,b \in \mathbb{Q} $ , but that is not correct. Similarly, I am unsure, what exactly $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]$ means. Surely, it does not mean the obvious $a+b\sqrt{2}+c\sqrt{3}) \mid a,b,c \in \mathbb{Q} $? From what little I understand, the correct answer is that both sets are described by $a+b\sqrt{2}+c\sqrt{3}+d\sqrt{6} \mid a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Q}$ and this is basis , but how do we get there? This was an extra credit assignment in Number Theory course as the lecturer did not cover the subject. EDIT: We use Ireland and Rosen's A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory, where on p.69 it is stated that we denote by $\mathbb{Q}[\alpha]$ the ring of polynomials in $\alpha$ with rational coefficients and then immediately it is proven that when $\alpha$ is in a ring of algebric integers $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ = $\mathbb{Q}[\alpha]$ That still leaves me unclear on what $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]$ means, because $\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}$ can not be an algebraic number, it is a tuple, a vector but not a single number. Thanks for the answers guys, but it looks like a very similar question was posted last year: Is $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) = \mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})$? so I suppose my question should be merged and I should make a more basic question about meaning of $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}]$","['quadratics', 'field-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'number-theory']"
269484,How can the graph of a complex function be embedded in three dimensional space?,"In his book Visual Complex Analysis (an awesome book, by the way), Needham, on the topic of graphing complex functions, says that Actually, the situation is not quite as hopeless as it seems. First,
  note that although two-dimensional space is needed to draw the graph
  of a real function $f$, the graph itself is only a one-dimensional
  curve, meaning that only one real number (namely $x$) is needed to
  identify each point within it. Likewise, altough four-dimensional
  space is needed to draw the set of points with coordinates $(x,y,u,v)= (z, f(z))$, the graph itself is two -dimensional, meaning that only two real numbers (namely $x$ and $y$) are needed to identify each
  point within it. Thus, intrinsically, the graph of a complex function
  is merely a two-dimensional surface, and it is this susceptible to
  visualization in ordinary three-dimensional space. Is this actually possible? I've been thinking for a while about how one would graph a complex function using only three dimensions, but I can't find a way.",['complex-analysis']

Let $F$ be a functor from the category of $A$ modules to the category of $B$ modules. Suppose that $F$ preserves injectivity and surjectivity: whenever $f : X\rightarrow Y$ is an injective map of $A$-modules, we have that $F(f) : F(X)\rightarrow F(Y)$ is an injective map of $B$ modules, and similarly for a surjective map. In other words, $F$ is both left and right exact. Is $F$ necessarily exact, in the sense that it takes short exact sequences to short exact sequences? It seems like all of the examples of non-exact functors one usually sees ($Hom$, $\otimes$, etc.) fail to preserve either injectivity or surjectivity, so I am wondering if there are any examples which preserve both.","['category-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-categories']"

I am trying to show that the Toeplitz operator $T_\phi$ is invertible if the function 1 is in the range of $T_\phi$.  Here is what I got so far: There exists a function $f\in H^2$ such that $T_\phi(f)=1$.  This implies $\phi \bar{f}=1+h$ is in $H^2$.  Then $\phi f\bar{f}=(1+h)f$ is in $H^1$.  Hence $\phi f\bar{f}=\alpha$ for some constant $\alpha$.  So $\phi$ and $\alpha$ have the same sign.  Thus $\phi$ is always positive or always negative. I do know that $\sigma(T_\phi)=[\operatorname{ess\,inf}(\phi),\operatorname{ess\,sup}(\phi)]$ but I do not know where to go from here. So I think it boils down to showing that if $\phi$ is always positive or always negative, then essinf$(\phi)$>0 or esssup$(\phi)<0$ respectively.","['functional-analysis', 'complex-analysis']"

Notice that in general I am not requiring $A$ and $B$ to be $k$-algebras, i.e. I am not requiring any kind of compatibility between the multiplicative structure and the product with scalars from the field.

Here I gather some things I can prove: 1) if the field is $k=\mathbb{Q}$ and $A$ and $B$ are $k$-algebras, then the answer is yes. 2) if the field is $k=\mathbb{R}$, $A$ and $B$ are $k$-algebras and they are fields, then the answer is yes again. 3) if $A$ and $B$ are finite $k$-algebras (and so $k$ is finite too) the answer is yes again. Unfortunately these rule out most of the examples from a first course in ring theory, so I suspect the answer would be more exotic than this, but I can't find anything.

269713,Does there exist a diagonal dominance concept for integral kernels?,"A self-adjoint diagonally dominant square matrix $M$ with nonnegative diagonal is positive semi-definite. Does there exist a similar concept for integration kernels that define compact operators over, say, $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$? Let me be more specific: Suppose $M$ is a self-adjoint square matrix.
$M$ is diagonally dominant if and only if, for all $i$,
$$ |M_{ii}| \geq \sum_{j\neq i} |M_{ij}|. $$
$M$ is invertible.
Suppose the diagonal satisfies $M_{ii}\geq 0$. Then $M$ is automatiaclly positive semidefinite. Thus, a simple criterion on the matrix elements determine whether $M$ is positive semidefinite -- a question which in general would involve computation of the whole spectrum of $M$. Let us turn to integration kernels. Suppose $u:\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is (for simplicity assumed to be) a Schwartz  function, such that we may define a compact operator $U$ over $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ using $u$ as integration kernel, viz,
$$ [U\phi](x)  := \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} u(x,y)\phi(y) d^n y. $$
Assume $u(x,y) = \overline{u(y,x)}$ such that $U$ is self-adjoint. $u(x,y)$ is analogous to the matrix elements $M_{ij}$ of $M$. Does there exist some sort of criterion for $u(x,y)$ analogous to $M$ being diagonally dominant, that guarantees $U\geq 0$? I.e., can we say something about whether $U$ is postive semidefinite by studying the behavior of $u(x,y)$ near the diagonal $x=y$? In general, positive semidefiniteness of $U$ is much harder to ascertain, i.e., we would have to study the spectrum of $U$.","['compact-operators', 'functional-analysis']"
269714,When a number is a square in the p-adic rationals - proof question (Quadratic Residues),"I'm a little stuck with the proof of a theorem I'm trying to understand.

Then $\exists\beta\in Q_p$ such that $\alpha=\beta^2\iff \exists\gamma\in Z/pZ$ such that $|\alpha-\gamma^2|_p<1$."" The proof is: Suppose $\exists\gamma\in Q_p$ such that $|\alpha -\gamma^2|_p<1$, (i.e. $\beta^2\equiv\alpha(modp)$ is soluble).
Now we construct a sequence $(\beta_n)$ by letting $\beta_1=\gamma$ and defining $\beta_n$ to satisfy: $|\beta_n^2-\alpha|_p<\frac{1}{p^n}$ and $|\beta_{n+1}-\beta_n|<\frac{1}{p^n}$ If we take $\beta_n$ as given, then we take $\beta_{n+1}=\beta_n+\delta_n$, so that $\beta_{n+1}^2=\beta_n^2+2\beta_n\delta_n+\delta_n^2$, and it is sufficient to take $\delta_n=\frac{\alpha-\beta_n^2}{2\beta_n}$. Conversely, the necessity is obvious if we choose $\gamma=\beta^2$. $\square$ I feel that I'm missing something which is stopping me from understand this. $|\beta_{n+1}-\beta_n|_p<\frac{1}{p^n}\implies p^n$ divides $(\beta_{n+1} - \beta_n)$, and if $\beta_{n+1}=\beta_n+\delta_n$ then this must mean $\delta_n$ is divisible by $p^n$. If we take $\delta_n$ as $\delta_n=\frac{\alpha-\beta_n^2}{2\beta_n}$, then this gives us $\beta_{n+1}^2=\alpha+\delta_n^2 \implies \beta_{n+1}^2-\alpha=\delta_n^2$. Then we have shown that $\beta_{n+1}-\alpha$ is divisible by $p^{n+1}$, i.e. that $|\beta_{n+1}^2-\alpha|_p<\frac{1}{p^{n+1}}$. Was this the aim of the proof? An inductive argument on the terms of $(\beta_n)$? If not what is it that I have misunderstood in this theorem?

They state that the transformation that quantifies the perpendicular displacement of a point from this line with be given by: $d = x \sin \theta - y \cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the slope angle of the line. I understand this to mean that the given equation should tell me the perpendicular distance from the point to the line. I have two problems: I can't see how this works, and it gives me different answers to other formulae that I do understand. The diagram below shows a point (A) and two lines, $y = x$ and $y = x + 6$. Obviously the distance from the point (the dotted line) should be longer for $y = x + 6$ than it should be for $y = x$, but the formula given in the paper gives the same result for both. Of course this is the case, as the formula takes into account three of the four variables involved (gradient of the line and x and y locations of the point, but not the y-intercept of the line). So, I have two questions: Am I correct in stating that the formula given in the paper does not calculate the distance from the point to the line. Given that it doesn't do that - what does it do? I assume it does something relevant (either that or the paper is completely wrong!) - but I can't seem to work out what it does by using trigonometry, constructing various triangles, and trying to understand where the equation came from - but I can't work it out!. It does seem to produce an answer that is vageuly related to the direction (if we just look at lines of different gradients - ignoring the intercepts - it seems to give a result which is related to the distance from the line).

To prove Relation (1) I first prove the relation:

$$AB^2+(R_g-R_b)^2=(R_b+R_g)^2\,.$$
(It was the previous Sengaku in the book.) We thus get the relations

AC^2 & =4R_gR_r\quad (3) \\

where $A$, $B$, $C$ are the orthogonal projections of the centers of the circles $C_b$, $C_g$ and $C_r$ on the line $d$. The relation $AB^2=AC^2+BC^2+2AC.BC$ then yields, using Relations (2) to (4),
$$4R_gR_b=4R_gR_r+4R_bR_r+8\sqrt{R_bR_g}R_r$$
Divided by $4R_rR_gR_b$ this equation is

There is a particular characterization of this distribution: it is the unique circularly symmetric distribution whose projections onto any line through the origin are uniformly distributed. Showing the projections of $f(x,y)$ are uniform is simple calculus. However I can't seem to think of an elegant proof for uniform projections implying $f$ must have the above density. If we let $R$ denote any rotation of coordinates $x,y\rightarrow x',y'$, then by assumption, $f(x,y)=R\circ f(x,y):=f(x',y')$. It would then suffice to show that $f(x,0)=\large\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$. Writing out the projected density as $u(x)$: $$u(x):=\int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}}f(x,y)dy$$ and we must have that $u(x)=1/2$ (being uniform on $[-1,1]$). Differentiating in $x$ with Leibnitz's rule seems to get nowhere. I've also tried considering the characteristic function of $f$ but got nowhere. If it helps, $f(x,y)$ arises from projecting the uniform distribution on the sphere to the $x,y$ plane.

One way I just realize is that for a kind of set systems to admit a generator, it suffices that the intersection of arbitrarily many such set systems still a set system of the same kind. In other words, the family of all set systems on the same ground set must be closed under arbitrary intersection. Am I right? Is it a necessary condition for existence of a generator? 
What kinds of  set systems are such that all such set systems on a grounding set are closed under arbitrary intersection, and what kinds are not? Added: A link says: Any type of algebraic structure on subsets of $S$ that is defined

What I mean by ""nice:"" For the measure, it should satisfy e.g. $\mu^{\circ}([a,b]) = b-a$ (e.g. like the Lebesgue measure). For the limit, I do not know exactly what I want, but it should not be something utterly useless and trivial. Let me try to be more clear. For example, set $\mu^{\circ}$ to be the Lebesgue measure, and the limits defined in the standard manner, i.e.
let

\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty} \mathcal{A}_n = \{x:x\in\mathcal{A}_n\mbox{ for all but finitely many }n\},

270093,Bayes Theorem Example in Nate Silver's The Signal and the Noise,"In his book The Signal and the Noise , Nate Silver presents this example application of Bayes's Theorem on pp. 247-248: Consider a somber example: the September 11 attacks. Most of us would
  have assigned almost no probability to terrorists crashing planes into
  buildings in Manhattan when we woke up that morning. But we recognized
  that a terror attack was an obvious possibility once the first plane hit
  the World Trade Center. And we had no doubt we were being attacked
  once the second tower was hit. Bayes's theorem can replicate this result. You can view the complete example in Amazon.com's previw, and I've made the two pages available here . Silver assumes the prior probability of a terrorist plane attack to be 1 in 20,000. After the first plane crash, using Bayes's Theorem he updates that to 38%. And after the second plane crash, he comes up with a 99.99% probability. However, I think he may be mistaken. I'll provide the details below. To be precise, let us define the following three events: $PC$ = Plane Crash: At least one plane crashes into a Manhattan skyscraper on a given day. $TPA$ = Terrorist Plane Attack: At least one plane is intentionally crashed into a Manhattan skyscraper on a given day. $APC$ = Accidental Plane Crash: At least one plane is accidentally crashed into a Manhattan skyscraper on a given day. We assume all plane crashes into buildings are either terrorist plane attacks or accidental (i.e. $PC = TPA \cup APC$). Using historical data, Silver estimates the prior probability of an accidental plane crash to be 1 in 12,500. In summary: $$P(TPA) = \frac{1}{20000},$$$$P(APC) = \frac{1}{12500}.$$ Furthermore, Silver assumes $P(APC) = P(PC|\overline{TPA})$ (which is true if $APC$ and $TPA$ are independent events). Applying Bayes's Theorem, he comes up with 
$$\begin{align}P(TPA|PC) &= \frac{P(PC|TPA) \times P(TPA)}{P(PC|TPA) \times P(TPA) + P(PC|\overline{TPA})(1-P(TPA))} \\
&= \frac{1 \times \frac{1}{20000}}{1 \times \frac{1}{20000} + 
\frac{1}{12500} \times (1 - \frac{1}{20000})} = 0.385\end{align}$$ Silver continues: The idea behind Bayes's theorem, however, is not that we update our 
  probability estimates just once. Instead, we do so continuously as new
  evidence presents itself to us. Thus our posterior probability of a
  terror attack after the first plane hit, 38 percent, becomes our prior probability before the second one did. And if you go through the calculation again, to  reflect the second plane hitting the World
  Trade Center, the probability that we were under attack becomes a
  near-certainty -- 99.99 percent. That is (this is Silver's calculation): $$P(TPA|PC) = \frac{1 \times 0.385}{1 \times 0.385 + 
\frac{1}{12500}(1-0.385)} = 99.99 \%$$ ""Cool!"" I thought, until I thought a bit more. The problem is that you can apply the same logic to calculate the conditional probability of an accidental crash, too. I'll spare you the math, but I come up with $P(APC|PC) = 0.615$ after the first crash, and $P(APC|PC) = 99.997\%$ after the second. So we can be almost certain the second plane crash is a terrorist attack, and we can be even more certain that it's accidental? I think the problem is that when Silver applies Bayes's Theorem after the second crash, he uses the updated probability of a terrorist plane attack as his prior, but fails to update the prior probability of an accidental plane crash (which should become 0.615). After the second crash, then, the correct formula is
$$P(TPA|PC) = \frac{1 \times 0.385}{1 \times 0.385 + 
0.615(1-0.385)} = 0.504$$ Similarly, the probability that we're observing an accidental crash given that there have been two crashes is 
$$P(APC|PC) = \frac{1 \times 0.615}{1 \times 0.615 + 
0.385(1-0.615)} = 0.806$$ Question 1 : Am I correct that Nate Silver is doing it wrong? Question 2 : Am I doing it right?","['bayesian', 'probability']"

270117,Where does this elliptic curve come from?,"In Zeta functions of an infinite family of K3 surfaces , Scott Alhgren, Ken Ono and David Penniston compute the zeta functions (given a good reduction restriction mentioned below) of the K3 surfaces $X_\lambda$ that are the smooth complete model of the double cover of $\mathbb{P}^2$ branched over the six lines
$$ U_\lambda : XYZ(X+\lambda Y)(X+Z)(Y+Z) = 0,$$
where $\lambda\in \mathbb{Q}\setminus\{0,-1\}$. Given a few pages of manipulating character sums, they find a nice relationship when counting points on $X_\lambda$ and on the elliptic curve
$$ E_\lambda : y^2 = (x-1)\left(x^2 - \frac{1}{\lambda + 1}\right),$$
and can show that over any finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ where $E_\lambda$ has good reduction, the zeta function of $X_\lambda$ is
$$ Z(X_\lambda/\mathbb{F}_p,T) = \frac{1}{(1-T)(1-p^2T)(1-pT)^{19}(1-\gamma pT)(1-\gamma \pi_{\lambda,p}^2T)(1-\gamma \bar{pi}_{\lambda,p}^2T)},$$
where $\pi_{\lambda,p}$ and $\bar{\pi}_{\lambda,p}$ are the eigenvalues of the Frobenius at $p$ on $E_\lambda$, and $\gamma$ is the Legendre symbol $\left(\frac{\lambda+1}{p}\right)$. Now certainly one could say the elliptic curve $E_\lambda$ comes from the character sum manipulation and leave it at that, but there's something deeper going on. If we go a little farther back, to the work of Jan Stienstra and Frits Beukers, On the Picard-Fuchs Equation and the Formal Brauer Group of Certain Elliptic K3-Surfaces , (on page 291) they associate to the K3 surface $X_1$, the elliptic curve
$$ E : y^2 = x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x, $$
and going through their references, one finds this curve comes from the cohomology of $X_1$. A result of Shioda shows that $E$ is very intrinsically attached to $X_1$ (over $\mathbb{C}$), as it is given by
$$ H^2(X_1,\mathcal{O})/j^*H^2(X_1,\mathbb{Z}),$$
where $j$ is the natural map in the exponential exact sequence
$$ 0 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \stackrel{j}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{O} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}^* \rightarrow 0$$
and $j^*$ is the induced map on cohomology
$$ H^1(X_1,\mathcal{O}^*) \rightarrow H^2(X_1,\mathbb{Z}) \stackrel{j^*}{\rightarrow} H^2(X_1,\mathcal{O}).$$ Now the work of Shioda (and Inose) only guarantees a model of the elliptic curve over some sufficiently large field of characteristic $p$, and in many small cases, the curves $E$ and $E_1$ are not isomorphic over $\mathbb{F}_p$ (as per a checked cases in Sage). So, is there any way to explain the use of the $E_\lambda$ without resorting to character sums? Is the choice of $E_\lambda$, despite giving a great result, perhaps the ''wrong'' choice of elliptic curve, given there are examples where $E$ and $E_1$ are not isomorphic over the base field? Either way, the idea of choosing a model over $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{F}_p$ from a given model over $\mathbb{C}$ is nontrivial, so something is, or may be going on here, and any thoughts would be appreciated.","['algebraic-geometry', 'characters', 'arithmetic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves', 'k3-surfaces']"

270184,Statistical Data Reconstruction,"As I read an introductory statistics book, a question struck me which am curious to find a good answer for. Background The author teaches that statistical classification (understand this to mean organizing raw data into say classes -e.g by grouping the data into equal-sized categories, and assigning them frequencies, like what happens in preparation of a histogram) is a form of data compression. He further teaches that much as this compression approach aids in extraction and learning of the important information embedded in the data, he warns that certain approaches (e.g the use of the mode as a measure of central tendency) risk leaking away important information. Of significance, he states that the mean (a measure of central tendency) and variance (a measure of variation / dispersion) are most important. Problem Now, I wonder, assuming one was to follow this line of thinking, and given a data sample, proceeded to statistically-compress it (in the sense indicated above). What statistical compression mechanism is sufficient to be able to recover without any loss whatsoever, the original data? And assuming such a lossless recovery is not possible, how can one reconstruct the most statistically-close (a probably approximate ) approximation to the original data? Side-Note What compression information is sufficient to best reconstruct (or approximate) the original dataset: Only the mean and variance? Knowledge of the probability distribution of the mean and that of the variance? Or a smaller, but more representative sample of the original population? Or just the probability distribution of the data? Any other better mechanism?

Now, assume there was some statistical operation(s),$f$, such that applying it to any of the above samples would yield a (smaller) set of information,$s$, from which the original dataset could be reconstructed ( preferably without any loss -- but a probably approximate reconstruction is equally good for me). The problem in this case would be to find such a function $f$ that can yield the small set of information $s$, from which (via some reverse-transformation, $f'$), one can obtain the original data: $$f(Data) = s$$  such that  $$f'(s) = Data$$ And $f$ is an application of statistical methods.",['statistics']

Let $u=\cos x$ and $v=\sin x$, we have $u^2+v^2=1$ and $av+bu=uv$. We can work on these equations, but I prefer the trigonometric way, i.e, analyze the properties of $f(x)$. I want to illustrate some details about $f(x)$, which might be useful. Let $a=r\cos\phi$ and $b=r\sin\phi$, where $r=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$, we have
$f(x)=r\sin(x+\phi)-\frac12\sin2x$. It's a linear combination of $\sin(x+\phi)$ and $\sin2x$. I don't know whether there's a systematical way to deal with it. Any idea? Thanks!","['trigonometry', 'calculus']"

270214,Generated sigma algebra from Brownian Motion,"Suppose that we have a Brownian motion and we define the P-augmented filtration by $$\mathcal{F}^W_t:=\sigma(\mathcal{F}^0_t \cup \mathcal{N})$$
where $\mathcal{F}_t^0:=\sigma(W_s;s\le t)$ and $\mathcal{N}:=\{B\subset \Omega|\exists A\in\mathcal{F}^0_\infty \mbox{ with }B\subset A \mbox{ and } P(A)=0\} $ Now suppose we have an equivalent measure of Girsanov type, i.e. the density has the form $$ \frac{dQ}{dP}=\mathcal{E}(\gamma \cdot W)$$ where $\mathcal{E}$ is the stochastic exponential. Moreover to be an equivalent measure we assume that $\mathcal{E}(\gamma\cdot W)_\infty >0$ and it is an uniformly integrable martingale. Hence we know, $W^*=W-\int\gamma ds$ is a $Q$-Brownian Motion. If we now define the Q-augmented filtration of $W^*$, is this the same as the P-augmented filtration for $W$, i.e. $$\mathcal{F}^W_t=\mathcal{F}^{W^*}_t$$ If $\gamma$ would be deterministic, I would intuitively say yes, but $\gamma$ is usually assumed to be an predictable process, so I'm not sure about it. As motivation: This question shows up in a script about mathematical finance: Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\{\mathcal{F}_t^W\},P)$ be a filtered prob. space. Suppose we have equivalent martingale measure for all the risky asset $S^1,\dots,S^n$, i.e. $Q$ is equivalent to $P$ and under $Q$, every $S^i$ is a martingale. We had the following martingale representation theorem: let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{F}_t^W),P)$ as above, then every local $P$ martingale $M$ has a continuous version and there exists a pred. process $b$(nice enough) such that
  $$ M(t)=M(0)+\int_0^t b(s)dW(s)$$ Am I right about the following: Saying that $Q$ is an EMM, means $S^i$ is a martingale with respect to $Q$ and the filtration given in the setup, here $(\mathcal{F}_t^W)$? In the script they say, we can write every $S^i$ as: $$dS^i_t=b(t)dW^*(t)$$ which comes from the martingale representation. So the thing I do not see is, we have a $Q$ martingale, with respect to the filtration $(\mathcal{F}_t^W)$ but we want to use the martingale rep. with $W^*$. Hence we must either know that $S^i$ is a $(\mathcal{F}_t^{W^*})$ martingale (w.r.t to $Q$), or the two filtrations should be equal. If $\mathcal{F}_t^W=\mathcal{F}_t^{W^*}$ then trivially $S^i$ is also a martingale w.r.t to $Q$ and $(\mathcal{F}_t^{W^*})$","['stochastic-calculus', 'stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory']"
270228,(geometric/intuitive) interpretation of ext,"In my current work I have to deal a lot with ext-groups (of modules). I feel kind of familar with the formalism, e.g. the connection between n-th extensions and ext. 
But I don't have a feeling about the meaning of $Ext$. Is there a informal/intuitive (geometric) interpretation of $Ext(M,N) $ in terms of Morphisms $M \to N$? For example, how far is the following interpretation away from beeing right? Consider a free resolution $\cdots \to F_n \to \cdots \to F_1 \to F_0 \to M$ of $M$ does $Ext^i(M,N)$ tells me something about the morphisms in the i-th syzygy $M_i$? e.g consists $Ext^1(M,N)$ of the morphisms of the module generated by the relations of the generators of $M$ modulo the ones, which come from the trivial relations?

Also, it's not quite difficult if only the first fundamental form is known and it is of the form $I=f(u,v)du^2+g(u,v)dv^2$. But what can I do if the coefficient of $du\ dv$ is not $0$ in the first fundamental form? For example, what is the Gaussian curvature if $I = (1+v^2)du^2+2uv\ du\ dv+(1+u^2)dv^2$?

Is there a diffeomorphism between it and half of an open disk? I think not since this would make the square $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ a manifold with boundary.

Start by taking $x,y \in U$. As path connected there exists continuous $\gamma : [0,1] \to U$ such that $\gamma (0) = x$ and $\gamma(1) = y$. Take $p \in U$. If $p$ is not on the the path $\gamma$. Then $x$ and $y$ are still path connected. If $p$ is lying on the path $\gamma$ then as $U$ is open, there exists a $\delta >0$ such that the ball $B(p,\delta) \subset U$. The path $\gamma$ crosses the boundary of this ball. Now one can create a new path which traverses round the edge of the ball. Hence $x$ and $y$ are still path connected. Is this proof valid?
