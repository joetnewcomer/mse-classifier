3904962,Is integration by substitution always the reverse chain rule?,"I understand that integration by substitution can be justified in the following way. If $I=\int f'(g(x))g'(x) \, dx$ then $I=f(g(x))+C$ . If we make the substitutions $$
u=g(x) \text{ and } du=g'(x)dx
$$ then $I$ becomes $\int f'(u)du=f(u)+C=f(g(x))+C$ , which is the same. However, I often see substitutions that don't seem to take this form. For example, a common way to evaluate $$
I=\int \sqrt{1-x^2} \, dx
$$ is by setting $x=\sin u$ (or, to be more precise, $u=\arcsin x$ ). The derivative of $\arcsin x$ is $$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, ,
$$ which does not appear in $I$ . It doesn't seem like $I$ is of the form $\int f(g(x))g'(x) \, dx$ . So why is this substitution justified? Are we still doing the chain rule in reverse, or is something else going on?","['integration', 'calculus', 'substitution']"
3905020,If $f(nx)=f(x)^n$ then $f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)$,"If $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}_{+}$ is injective monotone function and if, $f(nx)=f(x)^n$ for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ and for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$ , then, $$f(x+y)=f(x)f(y),\text{ for all }x,y\in\mathbb{R}$$ It is easy to check the equality if $y$ is a multiple of $x$ . I thought about proving the inequalities, $f(x+y)\le f(x)f(y)$ and $f(x+y)\ge f(x)f(y)$ , but I couldn't get to them. Assuming that $f$ is increasing and $x<y$ , then $y=kx+r$ , for some $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $0< r\le \lvert x \rvert$ , so $$f(x+y)=f(x+kx+r)=f(x(k+1)+r)\ge f(x(k+1))=f(x)^{k+1}=f(x)f(x)^k=f(x)f(kx)$$ That is, $f(x+y)\ge f(x)f(kx)$ , but the problem is that $f(kx)<f(y)$ so I can't continue the demonstration.","['algebra-precalculus', 'monotone-functions', 'real-analysis']"

3905321,Is my Calculus Proof Correct?,"Question:
A not uncommon calculus mistake is to believe that the product rule for derivatives says that $(fg)'=f'g'$ . If $f(x)=e^{x^2}$ , determine, with proof, whether there exists an open interval $(a,b)$ and a nonzero differentiable function $g$ defined on $(a,b)$ such that this wrong product rule is true for $x$ in $(a,b)$ . Is my solution correct? Is there anything I need to improve? My solution: We're trying to find a function $g$ such that $(fg)'=f'g'.$ Using the product rule, we get $$f'g + fg' =  f'g'.$$ Plugging in both $f(x)=e^{x^2}$ and $f'(x)=2xe^{x^2},$ we get $$2xe^{x^2}g + e^{x^2}g' = 2xe^{x^2}g'.$$ Simplifying and canceling $e^{x^2},$ we get $$\frac{g'}{g} = \frac{2x-1}{2x} = 1 +  \frac{1}{2x-1}.$$ Taking the integral of both sides, $$\int \frac{dg}g = \int 1+ \frac{1}{2x-1} \, dx.$$ $$\log|g| = \frac{\log|2x-1|}{2} + x + C.$$ $$|g| = e^{\frac{\log|2x-1|}{2}}e^xe^C.$$ Letting $e^C=K,$ we get $$\boxed{g = Ke^x\sqrt{|2x-1|}},$$ Where K is a constant greater than 0.
Therefore, on any interval $(a,b)$ that does not contain the value of $\frac{1}{2},$ there exists nonzero differentiable function $g$ defined on $(a,b)$ such that $(fg)'=f'g'$ is true for $x$ in $(a,b)$ .","['integration', 'calculus', 'solution-verification', 'derivatives']"

3905403,(Borel) Normal number problem,"Problem: Given an integer $b \ge 2$ , a number $x \in [0,1)$ is (Borel) normal base-b, if its b-ary representation as a sequence $(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,...)$ -where $\sigma_i \in \{0,1,...,b-1\}$ are such that $x=\sum_{i \ge 1} \sigma_i b^{-i}$ -obeys the following: For eaach $r \ge 1$ and each $\overline{\sigma_1},...,\overline{\sigma_r} \in \{0,1,...,b-1\}, \frac{1}{n}\#\{k=1,...,n:(\sigma_{k+1},...,\sigma_{k+r})=(\overline{\sigma_1},...,\overline{\sigma_r})\}$ converges to $b^{-r}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ . A number x is absolutely normal if it is normal base b for every integer $b \ge 2$ . Prove if $\mathcal{U}=\textbf{Uniform}([0,1])$ , then $\mathcal{U}$ is absolutely normal almost surely. Theorem 1: Almost every real number is absolutely normal. Proof: A number $x \in (0,1)$ is not absolutely normal if there exist $b \ge 2$ , $L \in \mathbf{N}$ and $a_1,...,a_L \in \{0,...,b-1\}$ such that if $x=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{c_n}{b^n}$ then $$\textbf{lim inf}_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\# \{n \le N-L |c_{n+i}=a_i,i=1,...,L\}}{N}<\frac{1}{b^L}$$ . Then there exists $s \in \{0,...,L-1\}$ such that $$\textbf{lim inf}_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\# \{n \le N-L, n \equiv s (\textbf{mod L}) |c_{n+i}=a_i,i=1,...,L\}}{N}<\frac{1}{Lb^L}$$ . Hence for some rational $\beta<\frac{1}{Lb^L}$ , $$\textbf{lim inf}_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\# \{n \le N-L, n \equiv s (\textbf{mod L}) |c_{n+i}=a_i,i=1,...,L\}}{N} \le \beta$$ . Denote by $R_{b,La,s,\beta}$ the set of all $x=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{c_n}{b^n}$ satisfying $$\textbf{lim inf}_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\# \{n \le N-L, n \equiv s (\textbf{mod L}) |c_{n+i}=a_i,i=1,...,L\}}{N} \le \beta$$ . The result of the prvious paragraph is that the set of not absolutely normal number is a subset of $$\bigcup_{b=2}^{\infty} \bigcup_{L=1}^{\infty} \bigcup_{a_1,...,a_L}^{b-1} \bigcup_{s=0}^{L-1} \bigcup_{\beta \in (0, \frac{1}{Lb^L}\cap \mathcal{Q}} R_{b,L,a,s,\beta}$$ .
It is sufficient to prove every set $R_{b,L,a,s,\beta}$ has zero measure. Then the set of not absolutely normal numbers is a subset of a countable union of null sets, hence it is a null set. Let $b \ge 2, L \in \mathcal{N}, a_1,...,a_L \in \{0,...,b-1\}, s \in \{0,...,L-1\}$ and $\beta \in (0,\frac{1}{Lb^L}$ . Put $A=a_1b^{L-1}+a_2b^{L-2}+...+a_L$ . Let $$x=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{c_n}{b^n}=\sum_{n=1}^s \frac{d_n}{b^n}+\frac{1}{b^s}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{d_{s+n}}{b^{Ln}} \in R_{b,L,a,s\beta}$$ . Then obviously $$\# \{n \le N-L,n \equiv s(\textbf{mod L})|c_{n+i}=a_i,i=1,...,L\}=\# \{s<n \le [\frac{N-s}{L}]|d_n=A\}$$ . Hence $$\textbf{lim inf}_{M \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\# \{s<n \le M| d_m=A}{M}=\textbf{lim inf}_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\# \{s<n \le [\frac{N-s}{L}]|d_n=A\}}{[\frac{N-s}{L}]} \le L\beta$$ . From this we obtain $R_{b,L,a,s\beta} \subseteq P$ , where $$P=\{x=\sum_{n=1}^s \frac{d_n}{b^n}+\frac{1}{b^s}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{d_{s+n}}{b^{Ln}}|\textbf{lim inf}_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\# \{s<n \le N |d_n=A\}}{N} \le L \beta\}$$ . Then it is sufficient to prove that the set P has zero measure. The complete version of the proof is found here.

In the research of switched linear systems, often problems of controllability(See here ) are considered. Other topics of research include minimizing , among all $\sigma$ suitable (e.g. steering to a certain point/region), a quadratic functional of $\sigma$ . However, I am not aware of any research looking at the minimum number of switches to reach a point/region. More precisely, consider a fixed $\mathbf x \in \mathbb R^n$ , a destination region $S \subset \mathbb R^n$ with $\mathbf x \notin S$ , a fixed $T>0$ (think of $T$ as being very large) and let $$\Sigma = \{\sigma : [0,T] \to \{1,2,...,N\}, \text{ The solution  of $\dot{x}(t) = A_{\sigma(t)}x(t)$ reaches $S$ before time $T$}\}$$ Assume that $\Sigma$ is non-empty. Now, for each $\sigma \in \Sigma$ , the number of times it switches is its number of discontinuities, so define $D(\sigma) = n$ if $\sigma$ has $n$ discontinuities, and $D(\sigma) = \infty$ if $\sigma$ has infinitely many discontinuities. Is there literature available on studying $\min_{\sigma \in \Sigma}D(\sigma)$ ? In words : Assuming there is a control steering $\mathbf x$ to $S$ , there is a control with at most $\_\_\_$ switches also steering $\mathbf x$ to $S$ . I would like to know if there are papers/textbooks which discuss this exact question, in the context of linear switched systems.

$$ How can we prove the existence and uniqueness of a homoclinic orbit (i.e. a solution $X$ of the system
for which $\lim_{t \to \infty} X(t) = \lim_{t \to -\infty} X(t) = x_0,$ where $x_0$ is an equilibrium point of the system) for the system? It is not hard to determine the equilibrium points: $(0,0), (-3, -6)$ and $(2/3, 1/9)$ . The latter two are asymptotically stable equilibrium points, so there cannot be a homoclinic orbit for those points. However, $(0,0)$ is a saddle equilibrium, so perhaps there is a homoclinic orbit here.
We can also see that the function $H(x,y) = - y^2 + x^2(1-x)$ is constant on the solutions of the system.
The set $H(x,y) = 0$ seems to be comprised of three solutions of the system, one of which is indeed a homoclinic orbit, so this proves existence. However, how do we prove that this is unique? I don't really know how to approach this part.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"

3905809,On the proof of the Stochastic Exponential by Protter (Thm 37 of Ch 2),"This is a theorem on the stochastic exponential from Protter's Stochastic Integration and Differential Equations. I have seen some questions about this theorem and the book from the site, but not on these questions which I believe are not so easy to understand as written in the proof. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone who has read through this text or know the subject well could enlighten me on these questions. Here, $X$ is cadlag, adapted, semimartingale and $\Delta X_s = X_s - X_{s-}$ . We define the quadratic covariation process $[X,Y]$ of two semimartingales $X$ and $Y$ as the unique adapted cadlag process with paths of finite variation on compacts that makes $XY - [X,Y]$ a local martingale and can be computed by $$[X,Y] = X_0 Y_0 + \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_i (X^{T_{i+1}^n} -X^{T_i^n})(Y^{T_{i+1}^n} -Y^{T_i^n})$$ where convergence is uniform on compacts in probability for a sequence of random partitions $\sigma_n$ tending to identity and $\sigma_n$ is the sequence $0=T_0^n \le T_1^n \le \cdots T_{k_n}^n$ with $T_i^n$ stopping times. Tending to identity means that $\lim_n \sup_k T_k^n = \infty$ and $\Vert \sigma_n \Vert = \sup_k |T_{k+1}^n - T_k^n| \to 0$ a.s. Moreover, $[X,Y]^c$ denotes the path by path continuous part of $[X,Y]$ . And a semimartingale is called a pure jump if $[X,X]^c = 0$ . I have attached the theorem and proof at the bottom. Questions: It is written in the proof that clearly the product $$\Pi_{s \le t} (1+\Delta X_s) \exp(-\Delta X_s)$$ is cadlag, adapted. But why is this infinite product cadlag, adapted? Adapted I think follows since this is just a limit of adapted processes, but I cannot see how to show that this is right continuous with left hand limits. Second, the proof shows that since $X$ has cadlag paths, it has only a finite number of $s$ such that $|\Delta X_s| \ge 1/2$ on each compact interval for each fixed $\omega$ , and so it suffices to show that $$V_t = \Pi_{0 < s \le t} (1+\Delta X_s 1_{|\Delta X_s| <1/2}) \exp (-\Delta X_s 1_{|\Delta X_s | <1/2})$$ converges and is of finite variation. Convergence is clear since we need only multiply finite terms to get $Z_t$ . But how do we get that $Z_t$ is also of finite variation if $V_t$ is? In the second part of the proof uses Ito's formula (or the Change of Variables) by setting $K_t = X_t - \frac{1}{2}[X,X]_t^c$ and $S_t = \Pi_{s \le t} (1+\Delta X_s) \exp(-\Delta X_s)$ , and $f(x,y) = ye^x$ and set $Z_t = f(K_t, S_t).$ In going to the second equality in (*), it is claimed that $S$ is a pure jump process and so $[K,S]^c = [S,S]^c = 0$ . But I cannot prove how to show that $S$ is a pure jump process, i.e. its quadratic variation has no continuous part, and why does this give $[K,S]^c=0$ ? In fact, I cannot see where he uses $[K,S]^c = 0$ since the only thing that changes in the two forms is that $\frac{1}{2}\int_{0+}^t Z_{s-} d[K,K]_s^c$ becomes $\frac{1}{2} \int_{0+}^t Z_{s-} d[X,X]_s^c$ , so it seems like we only need that $[K,K]_s^c = [X,X]_s^c$ . Where does $[K,S]^c$ come into play here? Finally, it is claimed that $Z_s = Z_{s-} (1+ \Delta X_s)$ . Why does this hold? I would greatly appreciate some help with these questions.","['stochastic-integrals', 'stochastic-analysis', 'probability-theory', 'stochastic-calculus']"

$$ (using a ""minimal industry"" of relations, possibly remaining inside the real analysis)? So i have found a solution to the problem, it is part of my solution for math.stackexchange.com - questions - 3854736 ,
but not a satisfactory solution. ""There should be more"", explaining why there is a ""clean result"" for the integral. Here, i am not strictly interested in a computational approach. I just want to share this with the community in these days of isolation. Any idea to attack this, or a related integral involving ""three log factors"" is welcome. (Well, the $\arctan$ is a sort of $\log$ in a sense that i don't want to define closer, see below.) Computations may be safely done ""modulo integrals involving two or one log factor"". But an illuminating, short way to show the above formula for $J$ would be wonderful. Motivation: The above relation appeared as i tried to solve the integral posted at the above link: Calculate $\displaystyle\int_0^{2\pi} x^2\; \cos x \cdot\operatorname{Li}_2(\cos x)\; dx$ . After several simplifications and substitutions, it turns out that the above integral is related to integrals of the shape $\int_0^1\log t\; R(t)\; dt$ ,  and $\int_0^1\arctan t\cdot \log t\; R(t)\; dt$ ,  and $\int_0^1\arctan^2 t\cdot \log t\; R(t)\; dt$ , and ""similar"" expressions. Here $R$ is in each case a (rather simple) rational function.
(The more log and/or arctangent factors, the higher the computational complexity.) I could compute more or less algorithmically most of the the needed integrals to solve the linked problem, all of them but the integral $$
K=\int_0^1\arctan^2 t\cdot\log t\cdot\frac2{1-t^2}\; dt\ ,
$$ which turned out to be very hard to attack with the methods of real analysis.
Computing this integral is more or less equivalent to computing $J$ , and the question wants $J$ instead, since we have a ""clean formula"", so that some speculation about a ""clever substitution"" may be accepted. My solution (for $K$ ) works in complex analysis, the first step is to write $$
\int_0^1 =\int_0^i+\int_i^1\ ,
$$ then parametrize the first integral using a linear path, the second one using a path on the unit circle. Some comments: I will say some more words, because the situation is rich in coincidences. Since a numerical evidence is the simplest and shortes way to present (instead of showing how to show), i will use this method to at least list the coincidences. Many equalities below are ""equivalent"" (modulo computation of integrals of lower complexity) to the formula for $J$ . First of all, a numerical experiment using pari/gp delivers some connection between $K$ and a ""cousin"" of $J$ : ? 2 * intnum( t=0, 1, atan(t)^2 * log(t) / (1-t^2) )

3906337,Distance between two circles with known size and intersection area,"Caution - biologist at work I am trying to plot some circles and want to work out how far apart my circles should be with a target in mind. The ditance between the centre points of the two circles is $d$ . The first circle has a radius of $r_1$ = 5 cm and the second has a radius of $r_2$ = 4 cm. The area of these circles is 78.54 cm $^2$ and 50.27 cm $^2$ respectively, making the joint area $a_{1,2}$ = 128.81 cm $^2$ . I want 30% of that area, $0.3 \times 128.81$ cm $^2$ to be intersection area (area shared by the two circles). Therefore I have a known pair of radii and a known intersection area, and an unknown distance. By trial and error with various values of $d$ in the equation $$ a_{1,2} = r_1^2 cos^{-1} \frac{d^2 + r_1^2 - r_2^2}{2dr_1} + r_2^2 cos^{-1} \frac{d^2 + r_2^2 - r_1^2}{2dr_2} - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(-d+r_1+r_2)(d+r_1-r_2)(d-r_1+r_2)(d+r_1+r_2)} $$ I find that, to get 30% of the total area into the intersection area, when the radii are 5 and 4, $d$ needs to be approximately 2.71. However, is there a way to solve $d$ from known radii and intersection area?

3906610,"If a measure $\mu$ arises from the restriction of an outer measure $\mu^{*}$, is it true that $\mu$ is saturated?","A measure $\mu$ on a measurable space $(X, \mathcal{M})$ is called saturated if given a subset $E$ of $X$ the condition $E \cap A \in \mathcal{M}$ for every $A \in \mathcal{M}$ with $\mu(A) < \infty$ implies that $E \in \mathcal{M}$ (that is if any locally measurable subset of $X$ is measurable). The Wikipedia article on saturated measures states that ""measures arising as the restriction of outer measures are saturated"". I know how to prove this result when the outer measure itself arises from a pre-measure (a nice proof can be found in the answer to this question ), but not every outer measure is generated by a pre-measure so I'd like to know if the previous assertion is actually true and, if it is, how can I prove the result in the general case, that is how can I show that any measure $\mu$ resulting from the restriction of an outer measure $\mu^{*}$ is saturated? I wasn't really sure about the validity of the result so I tried to construct a counterexample by considering the set $X = \{0,1\}$ and the outer measure $\mu^{*} : \mathcal{P}(X) \rightarrow [0, \infty]$ given by $\mu^{*}(\emptyset)=0$ , $\mu^{*}(\{0\}) = 2$ , $\mu^{*}(\{ 1 \})=2$ and $\mu^{*}(X)=3$ which is not generated by a pre-measure and has $\emptyset$ and $X$ as the only two $\mu^{*}$ -measurable subsets of $X$ . The problem is that the measure induced by this outer measure $\mu^{*}$ is saturated (since $\mu^{*}(X) is finite), so if a counterexample does exist it would be nice to know it. If every measure obtained by the restriction of an outer measure is actually saturated, I'd like to know a proof of this result and my attempt was to consider the measure space $(X, \mathcal{M}^{*}, \overline{\mu})$ where $\mathcal{M}^{*}$ is the $\sigma$ -algebra on $X$ consisting of the $\mu^{*}$ -measurable subsets of $X$ and $\overline{\mu}$ is the restriction of the outer measure $\mu^{*}$ to $\mathcal{M}^{*}$ and then considering the outer measure, say $\mu^{+}$ , induced by the measure $\overline{\mu}$ . Since the outer measure $\mu^{+}$ is induced by the measure $\overline{\mu}$ , we know that the measure obtained by restricting $\mu^{+}$ to the collection of $\mu^{+}$ -measurable subsets of $X$ , say $\hat{\mu}$ , is a saturated measure and I believe I would be able to finish the proof if $\mathcal{M}^{*}$ is equal to the $\sigma$ -algebra of $\mu^{+}$ -measurable subsets of $X$ and $\mu^{+}= \mu^{*}$ (but I think this is only true if the original outer measure $\mu^{*}$ is induced by a pre-measure which leads us back to the original problem of proving the desired result when we drop this assumption).

P\left( \log(X) > E[\log(X)] + \eta \right)
\end{eqnarray*} for a given $\eta > 0$ . One bound can be obtained this way: \begin{eqnarray*}
P\left( \log(X) > E[\log(X)] + \eta \right) &=&  P\left( X > \exp(E[\log(X)] + \eta) \right) \\
& \leq & E[X] / \exp(E[\log(X)] + \eta)  \\
& = & \exp( \log E[X] - E[\log(X)] - \eta ) \\
& \leq & \exp(\epsilon - \eta)

P\left( \log(X) > E[\log(X)] + \eta \right) & \leq & \exp(-\eta)

P\left( \log(X) > E[\log(X)] + \eta \right) = 0.

Recall that in the case $R=k$ an algebraically closed field, $V_k(I)(k)$ is in bijective correspondence with the maximal ideals of $k[x_1,\dots ,x_n]$ . Now, in the course, we talked about the geometric points of a ring $A$ , defining them as the equivalence classes of ring homomorphisms $A\to K$ , where $K$ is a field (not fixed). The motivation that we were given is that this is a generalization of the construction above, since in this way we can obtain a correspondence between homomorphisms and prime ideals, not only maximal ideals; moreover, one can consider any ring, not necessarily a $k$ -algebra. However, I don't understand in what sense this is a generalization: it seems to me that they are just different constructions.

Am I right? Moreover, I have not clear the sense of arriving to the prime ideals, but not to any ideal (i.e. why geometric points of a ring $A$ are not defined as the classes of homomorphisms from $A$ to any ring).

3907213,What is 'Operator valued function is holomorphic' ? Does Neumann series imply holomorphic?,"Let $H_1$ and $H_2$ be Hilbert spaces and $K(w):H_1 \rightarrow H_2$ be an operator for given $w\in\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}$ .(like a resolvent. It would not be resolvent.) In complex analysis, a function $f:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic if $$f'(w_0):=\lim_{w\rightarrow w_0} \frac{f(w)-f(w_0)}{w-w_0}$$ exists for every $w_0\in\Omega$ . And its limit takes modulus.
However, since an operator valued function $w \mapsto K(w) $ is not complex value, $\left|\frac{K(w)-K(w_0)}{w-w_0}\right|$ cannot be defined.
So, I can GUESS its limit is defined in operator norm, i.e. if $K'(w_0)$ is defined such that $$\left\|\frac{K(w)-K(w_0)}{w-w_0} - K'(w_0)\right\|_{H_1 \rightarrow H_2} \rightarrow 0 \quad as \quad w \rightarrow w_0,$$ $K(w_0)$ is holomorphic for $w_0 \in \Omega$ . In my book, there is no mention about this detail. By the way, consider the Neumann series, $$(I-K(w))^{-1} = \sum_k^\infty (K(w))^k.$$ In order to show $(I-K(w))^{-1}$ is holomorphic, I can think about 'analytic' first (since analytic and holomorphic is equivalent in $\mathbb{C}$ ) and Neumann series say ' $K(w)$ is analytic for each $w$ '. But, again,  it is not complex number. Questions What is definition of 'Operator valued function is holomorphic' ? Is my guess right ? Does it suffice to show existence of its Neumann series ?

3907304,An extension of Baire's category theorem,"In a topological space, a set is said to be rare if its closure has empty interior, and a set is said to be meager if it is a countable union of rare sets. If meager sets all have empty interior, then the topological space is said to be a Baire space. The following fact is known as Baire's category theorem. Theorem. Complete metric spaces and locally compact Hausdorff spaces are Baire spaces. [Zălinescu 2002] provides the following extension of this theorem for complete metric spaces, attributing it to C. Ursescu . Theorem. ([Zălinescu 2002, Theorem 1.4.5]) Let $X$ be a complete metric space, and $\{S_n\}$ be a sequence of open sets in $X$ . Then $\mathrm{cl}(\cap_{n=1}^\infty S_n)$ and $\cap_{n=1}^\infty \mathrm{cl}(S_n)$ have the same interior. It is easy to check that a topological space is a Baire space if and only if any countable intersection of dense open sets is still dense in this space. Consequently, the theorem above implies that complete metric spaces are Baire spaces. Thus it is considered as an extension. Question. Does the extension hold for locally compact Hausdorff spaces? Update: As pointed out by @Alex Kruckman, the property in Ursescu's theorem is indeed equivalent to the fact that $X$ is a Baire space. Theorem. A topological space is a Baire space if and only if $\mathrm{cl}(\cap_{n=1}^\infty S_n)$ and $\cap_{n=1}^\infty \mathrm{cl}(S_n)$ have the same interior for any sequence of open sets $\{S_n\}$ . Recall that a space is a Baire space if and only if any countable intersection of dense open sets is still dense. The theorem is essentially another way to state that a space is a Baire space if and only if all its open subspaces are Baire spaces. Combined with Baire's category theorem, this observation by Alex proves the desired theorem. My answer below proves it from scratch, the proof being essentially the same as that of Baire's category theorem for locally compact Hausdorff spaces. I will accept Alex's answer a few days later if nobody else has anything to add. Thanks.","['general-topology', 'baire-category', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

A point of codimension 1 in $X \times \mathbb A^1$ is called type I if its image $y$ under the projection to $X$ is codimension 1. We can see such an $x$ is the generic point of the fiber of $y$ . A point of codimension 1 in $X \times \mathbb A^1$ is called type II if its image is the generic point of $X$ . I understand on a technical level, thanks to other questions on this site, the first two paragraphs of the proof. However, when Hartshorne goes to show the map $$\pi^* : \operatorname{Cl} X \to \operatorname{Cl} (X \times \mathbb A^1)$$ given by $\sum n_i Y_i \mapsto \sum n_i \pi^{-1} Y_i$ , where $\pi$ is the projection to $X$ , I do not understand the following statements: Injectivity: If $D = \operatorname{div} f \in \operatorname{div} X$ , then $\pi^*D$ involves only prime divisors of type I. Why? Injectivity: The above forces $f \in K$ , the function field of $X$ . Why? He gives the reasoning that otherwise $f = g/h$ , with $g, h \in K[t]$ , which I understand, but then claims that if both are not in $K$ , the divisor of $f$ will involve some type II divisor. Why is this true? Surjectivity: Why does it suffice to check that prime type II divisors are linearly equivalent to sums of prime type I divisors? Do we already know we are surjective on type I divisors? Surjectivity: Why does localizing a type II prime divisor at the generic point give us a prime divisor in the spectrum of $K[t]$ ? Assuming the above statement, we see this divisor corresponds to a principal prime $P = (f)$ in $K[t]$ . I see that just fine. Hartshorne then claims the divisor of $f$ is $Z$ plus possibly some purely type I divisors. Why?

3907666,Intuition behind the general form of the solution in Frobenius Method?,"When we solve the equation $z^{2}u''+p(z)zu'+q(z)u=0$ using Frobenius method , we first find zeros of the indicial polynomial $r_1>r_2$ to get a solution $u_1$ . In the case that the difference of roots $r_1-r_2$ is an integer, we might need to find a second linearly independent solution using a different method. It is given on the Wikipedia page (and many other places) that $$
u_{2}=Cu_{1}\ln x+\sum _{{k=0}}^{\infty }B_{k}x^{{k+r_{2}}}
$$ gives the desired second solution. My question is: how do we come up with this general form of solution? I try to derive it in various ways, but find it hard to achieve - I have tried to write $u_2 =vu_1$ , which reduces the order of the DE and gives $$
v'= u_1^{-2}\exp\left(- \int \frac{p(z)}{z} dz\right),
$$ but this looks completely different from the formula above. I do see some vague intuition about the logarithmic term - we are basically saying: if multiplying by $x^{-r}$ does not make the solution analytic, then something stronger like $\ln x$ will.

It seems that $z$ should run from $1$ to $-(ax+by)/c$ and we can let $x$ and $y$ run from $1$ to $N$ , my reasoning being that if $x$ and $y$ are fixed, $z$ gets automatically fixed. Then our integral transforms into $$\iiint _S 1 dz dy dx=\int_1^N \int_1^N \int_1^{-(ax+by)/c} 1 dz dy dx=\int_1^N \int_1^N -(ax+by+c)/c  \mathrm{d}x dy$$ which is equal to $$\int_1^N-(ax^2/2+bxy+cx)|^{N}_1 dy=\int_1^N \left(-(aN^2/2+bNy+cN)+a/2+by+c\right)dy=-aN^3/2-bN^3/2-cN^2+aN/2+bN^2/2+cN+aN^2+bN/2+cN-a/2-b/2-c.$$ I feel like i am making an error somewhere, but I am not sure.

Any ideas ? After playing with formal Taylor series, here's a partial answer.
We can write $$\sum_{i=1}^M e^{x_i} = \sum_{\alpha\in \mathbb{N}_0^M} c_{\alpha} x^{\alpha}, \quad \text{with } c_{\alpha} =
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{k!}, &\mbox{if } \alpha = k e_k, \\

3908611,How did the author take the gradient to get $\overline{W} \Leftarrow \overline{W} - \alpha \nabla_{W} L_i$?,"I am currently studying the textbook Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Charu C. Aggarwal. Chapter 1.2.1.1 What Objective Function Is the Perceptron Optimizing? says the following: Can we find a smooth loss function, whose gradient turns out to be the perceptron update? The number of classification errors in a binary classification problem can be written in the form of a $0/1$ loss function for training data point $(\overline{X_i}, y_i)$ as follows: $$L_i^{(0/1)} = \dfrac{1}{2} (y_i - \text{sign}\{ \overline{W} \cdot \overline{X_i} \})^2 = 1 - y_i \cdot \text{sign} \{ \overline{W} \cdot \overline{X_i} \} \tag{1.7}$$ The simplification to the right-hand side of the above objective function is obtained by setting both $y_i^2$ and $\text{sign}\{ \overline{W} \cdot \overline{X_i} \}^2$ to $1$ , since they are obtained by squaring a value drawn from $\{ -1, +1 \}$ . However, this objective function is not differentiable, because it has a staircase-like shape, especially when it is added over multiple points. Note that the $0/1$ loss above is dominated by the term $- y_i \cdot \text{sign} \{ \overline{W} \cdot \overline{X_i} \}$ , in which the sign function causes most of the problems associated with non-differentiability. Since neural networks are defined by gradient-based optimization, we need to define a smooth objective function that is responsible for the perceptron updates. It can be shown that the updates of the perceptron implicitly optimize the perceptron criterion. This objective function is defined by dropping the sign function in the above $0/1$ loss and setting negative values to $0$ in order to treat all correct predictions in a uniform and lossless way: $$L_i = \max\{ - y_i ( \overline{W} \cdot \overline{X_i} ), 0 \} \tag{1.8}$$ The reader is encouraged to use calculus to verify that the gradient of this smoothed objective function leads to the perceptron update, and the update of the perceptron is essentially $\overline{W} \Leftarrow \overline{W} - \alpha \nabla_{W} L_i$ .

3908753,Understanding norm convergence of the truncated Hilbert transform,"For $\epsilon > 0$ and $f \in L^p, p \geq 1$ then it is not difficult to show that the function $$ H_\epsilon f(x) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{|y| > \epsilon} \frac{f(x-y)}{y}dy $$ is well defined.  In fact, much like the Hilbert transform, $H_\epsilon$ is weak $(1,1)$ and strong $(p,p)$ for $1< p < \infty$ . What I'm working to understand is why if $f \in L^p, 1 \leq p < \infty$ then the sequence $\{H_\epsilon f\}$ converges to $Hf$ in $L^p$ .  For now let's assume $p > 1$ (the $p=1$ case boils down to replacing norm convergence with convergence in measure in the following statements).  Letting $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of Schwartz functions converging to $f$ in $L^p$ then I have $$ \|Hf - H_\epsilon f\|_p \leq \|Hf - Hf_n\|_p + \|Hf_n - H_\epsilon f_n\|_p + \|H_\epsilon f_n - H_\epsilon f\|_p . $$ Given the strong $(p,p)$ inequalities of $H_\epsilon$ and $H$ , then I am good with the first and third terms on the right-hand side of the inequality.  My struggle is with the middle term: I can't seem to understand why $H_\epsilon f_n$ would converge to $Hf_n$ in $L^p$ .

3908766,Uniqueness of solution of an integral equation [Updated],"Problem. Be $f\in \mathcal{C}(\mathbf{R})$ and fix $c_0\in\mathbf{R}$ and $c_2<0$ . Consider the integral equation $$ f(y) = c_0 + c_2 y^2 + \int dz\, f(z) \exp(f(y-z)) $$ where the integral is over $(-\infty,\infty)$ . Under some conditions on $c_0$ and $c_2$ , it is possible to find $a_0$ and $a_2$ such that $f(y)=a_0+a_2 y^2$ is a solution. The problem is: Is this solution unique? Let's be free to choose specific (nontrivial) values for $c_0$ and $c_2$ if that simplifies the analysis; in particular though, let's keep $c_2\neq 0$ . Also, let's be free to assume that $f$ is smooth, e.g. $f\in \mathcal{C}^2(\mathbf{R})$ . Roughly speaking, the problem is how to prove that there is only one solution to an equation like $$ f * \exp f(y) = c_2 y^2 + f(y). $$ Attempt 1. From the form of the equation, it is natural to define the operator $$ F_r(f)(y) \triangleq c_0 + c_2 y^2 + \int_{-r}^r dz\, f(z) \exp(f(y-z)) $$ and regard the solution as a fixed point of $F_r$ for any fixed $r>0$ . So my first attempt would be to apply Banach fixed point theorem to $F_r$ . I don't know if this works at all, even in principle, since $f\in \mathcal{C}(\mathbf{R})$ , but for now this is what I have: \begin{align} \| F_r(f)-F_r(g) \|_\infty 
& \leq \sup_{y\in\mathcal{B}_r(0)} \int_{-r}^r dz  \left| f(z)\exp(f(y-z)) - g(z)\exp(g(y-z)) \right|
\end{align} where $\mathcal{B}_r(0)$ is the ball of radius $r$ and center the origin. From here, I should try to end up with something like $C\|f-g\|_\infty$ for some $C>0$ ... Attempt 2. A different approach is to show that, if $f^*$ and $g^*$ are two solutions, i.e., $F(f^*)=f^*$ and $F(g^*)=g^*$ , then $f^*=g^*$ . I tried the following: Since by assumption $f^*$ and $g^*$ are two solutions, then $$ f^*(y) - g^*(y) = F(f^*)(y) - F(g^*)(y) = \int dz\, \big[f^*(y-z) \exp(f^*(z))-g^*(y-z) \exp(g^*(z))\big]. $$ I should show that the above quantity is identically equal to zero (for all $y$ ). I would proceed by contradiction. Suppose that $f^*\neq g^*$ , that is, there exists $h=f^*-g^*$ that is not identically zero. Suppose that $h(y)\neq 0$ in a neighborhood of $y=y_0$ . Then I try to expand $h$ in Taylor series around $y=y_0$ . For any $y\neq y_0$ it results \begin{multline} 0 \neq h(y_0) + h'(y_0)(y-y_0) + \cdots \\ = \int dz\, \bigg[ ( f^*(y_0-z) + (f^*)'(y_0-z)(y-y_0+z) + \cdots) \exp(f^*(z)) \\ - ( g^*(y_0-z) + (g^*)'(y_0-z)(y-y_0+z) + \cdots) \exp(g^*(z))  ) \bigg]. \end{multline} In the end, I should lead to some contradiction, e.g. the integrand is zero... Attempt 3. I don't know if it is just a coincidence or not, but the solution $f(y)=a_0 + a_2 y^2$ has the same form of the term $c_0+c_2 y^2$ . In other words, if we define the operator $$ G(f) \triangleq f * \exp f - f $$ then the problem is to find $f$ such that $$ G(f)(y) = c_0 + c_2 y^2 .$$ Therefore, an approach may be to find the solution to a “Green equation” like $$G(\varphi)(y)=\delta_y$$ where $\delta_y$ represents a Dirac mass at $y$ . Such a $\varphi$ would (?) unlock the possibility of solving the “inhomogeneous” case.","['functional-equations', 'integral-equations', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

The operator is defined by $$(T\mathbf{a})_{n}=a_{n+1}-a_{n}.$$ I want to compute the spectral resolution of this operator. From this website, https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Spectral_resolution , the spectrum measure $\mu$ can define resolution by $\mu((-\infty, t))$ . So I guess the key is to get the spectral measure of this operator. Edit 1: I think I got at least the spectrum Given $\Psi\in\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ , we can define $\hat{\Psi}\in L^{2}([0,2\pi))$ by $\hat{\Psi}(\xi):=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}e^{in\xi}\Psi_{n},$ with $$\Psi_{n}=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}e^{in\xi}d\xi.$$ Then, the map $$U:\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z})\longrightarrow L^{2}([0,2\pi),\dfrac{d\xi}{2\pi}),\ \ \Psi\longrightarrow_{U}\hat{\Psi},$$ is unitary. We want to know what does $UTU^{-1}$ give us. Take $f(\xi)\in L^{2}([0,2\pi))$ , then $$(TU^{-1}f)(n)=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}(e^{-i(n+1)\xi}-e^{-in\xi})f(\xi)d\xi=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}e^{-in\xi}(e^{-i\xi}-1)f(\xi)d\xi,$$ which implies that $$(UTU^{-1})(\xi)=(e^{-i\xi}-1)f(\xi).$$ Now we have the form of our operator in Fourier space, we are equipped to determine its spectrum. Look at the resolvent: \begin{align*}
R(T):=\{\lambda:(\lambda-T)\ \text{is invertible}\}&=\{\lambda:\lambda-e^{-i\xi}+1\neq 0\ \ \text{for all}\ \ \xi\in [0,2\pi)\}\\
&=\{\lambda:\lambda\neq e^{-i\xi}-1\ \ \ \text{for all}\ \ \xi\in [0,2\pi)\}\\
&=\mathbb{C}\setminus \{|\lambda+1|=1\}.
\end{align*} This implies that the spectrum is $$\sigma(T)= \{|\lambda+1|=1\}.$$ We denote this set to be $\mathbb{S}_{1}^{*}(-1,1)$ . Am I correct? Edit 2: I possibly get the spectral measure. But it confuses me Now, for $f\in C(\mathbb{S}^{*}(-1,1))$ in Fourier space $f(T)$ is just multiplication by $f(e^{-i\xi}-1)$ . Fix $\Psi\in\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ , and let $\hat{\Psi}$ be the corresponding function in $L^{2}([0,2\pi))$ . Then \begin{align*}
\int f(T)d\mu_{\Psi}=\langle \Psi|f(T)\psi\rangle_{\ell^{2}}&=\langle U^{-1}U\Psi|f(T)U^{-1}U\Psi\rangle_{\ell{^2}}\\
&=\Big\langle U\Psi\Bigg|\Big(Uf(T)U^{-1}\Big)U\Psi\rangle_{L^{2}}\\
&=\langle \hat{\Psi}|f(e^{-i\xi}-1)\hat{\Psi}\rangle_{L^{2}}\\
&=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\overline{\hat{\Psi}}f(e^{-i\xi}-1)\hat{\Psi}d\xi\\
&=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}f(e^{-i\xi}-1)|\hat{\Psi}(\xi)|^{2}d\xi.
\end{align*} Write $\lambda:=e^{-i\xi}-1$ , then $d\xi=\frac{d\lambda}{-e^{-i\xi}}$ and $\xi=i\log(\lambda+1)$ where $\log$ is taking over the principal branch (it's okay if just a general $\log$ since $\xi\in [0,2\pi]$ ). Then, \begin{align*}
\int fd\mu_{\Psi}&=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\mathbb{S}_{1}^{*}(-1,0)}f(\lambda)|\hat{\Psi}(i\log(\lambda+1))|^{2}\dfrac{d\lambda}{-e^{-i\xi}},
\end{align*} therefore, $$d\mu_{\Psi}=|\hat{\Psi}(i\log(\lambda+1))|^{2}\dfrac{d\lambda}{-e^{-i\xi}}\Bigg|_{\mathbb{S}_{1}^{*}(-1,0)}.$$ According to this website, https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Spectral_resolution , the spectrum measure $\mu$ can define resolution by $\mu((-\infty, t))$ . But you see my spectrum density is restricted to the unit circle. I am not sure how to go back to the real line. Are the above things correct?
