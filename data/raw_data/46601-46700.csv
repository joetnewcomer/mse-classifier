468028,Which integration theory to use?,"As far as I know the Lebesgue integral generalises the Riemann integral. One key ingredient to this generalisation is that the Lebesgue integral partitions the range, not the domain as in the Riemann theory, to obtain subsets of the domain. The sum of measures of the subsets is the evaluation of the (definite) integral. An upshot is that there is more freedom with the Lebesgue integral than with the Riemann integral (such as freely interchanging limits and integral sign, for example) My question is this: If I'm working with a (definite) integral which is Riemann integrable, then might it be helpful to apply the Lebesgue theory? For example, suppose the integral is proving tricky to evaluate. Could considering the integral as a Lebesgue integral possibly make the evaluation easier? I don't suppose this would help much with an indefinite integral since Lebesgue derives the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus from his theory which is ""the same as"" that of the Riemann theory.","['lebesgue-integral', 'integration']"

468045,Equivalence of the Lebesgue integral and the Henstock–Kurzweil integral on nonnegative real functions,"Let $f:[a,b]\to[0,\infty)$ ($\mathbb{R}\ni a<b\in\mathbb{R}$), and fix $c\geq0$. I want to establish the equivalence of the concepts of Lebesgue integrability and Henstock–Kurzweil integrability for this class of functions. In particular, consider the following statements: (1)  For any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a simple function $\omega=\sum_{j=1}^n z_j\mathbf{1}_{E_j}$ (where $n\in\mathbb{Z}_+$, the $\{z_j\}_{j=1}^n$ are distinct non-negative numbers, and the $\{E_j\}_{j=1}^n$ are Lebesgue measurable sets that form a partition of $[a,b]$) such that $0\leq\omega\leq f$ and (1a) $f$ is Lebesgue measurable and $\sum_{j=1}^n z_j\mu(E_j)\in( c-\varepsilon,c]$, where $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure, and the analogous sum of any non-negative simple function dominated by $f$ does not exceed $c$; OR (1b) $f$ is Lebesgue measurable and $\sum_{j=1}^n z_j\mu(E_j)> \varepsilon$. (2) For any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a “gauge” function $\delta_{\varepsilon}:[a,b]\to(0,\infty)$ such that for any $(x_j,t_j)_{j=1}^n\subset[a,b]$ ($n\in\mathbb{Z}_+$) satisfying $a<x_1<\ldots<x_{n-1}<x_n=b$, $t_j\in[x_j,x_{j-1}]$ for all $j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$ (where $x_0\equiv a$), and $x_j-x_{j-1}<\delta_{\varepsilon}(t_j)$ for all $j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, then (2a) $\left|\sum_{j=1}^n f(t_j)(x_j-x_{j-1})-c\right|<\varepsilon$ for all $j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$; OR (2b) $\sum_{j=1}^n f(t_j)(x_j-x_{j-1})>\varepsilon$ for all $j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$. I want to show that $(1a)\Longleftrightarrow(2a)$ and $(1b)\Longleftrightarrow(2b)$. The tricky parts are as follows: For a given Lebesgue measurable function with integral $c$ (or $\infty$), how can one construct the desired gauge function so that the Henstock–Kurzweil integral is $c$ (or does not exist, respectively)? For a given Henstock–Kurzweil integrable function whose integral is finite or does not exist because it would be unbounded, how can one prove that it is Lebesgue measurable? For a given Henstock–Kurzweil integrable function, how can one construct the desired step function? I skimmed through some of the relevant literature, but I failed to find any satisfying and not-too-abstruse explanation. (Disclaimer: I'm a newbie in HK-integration with some background in measure theory.) Thank you very much for your help in advance. Note: (1a) basically states that $\int_{[a,b]}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x)=c$ and (1b) that $\int_{[a,b]}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x)=\infty.$","['integration', 'measure-theory', 'gauge-integral', 'real-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral']"

468124,What does it mean for the coordinate ring of an affine variety to be graded?,"My question is relatively simple, assume that $X$ is an affine variety such that its coordinate ring $A:=\Bbbk[X]:=H^0(\mathcal O_X,X)$ is $\Lambda$-graded for some monoid $\Lambda$. Now if $\Lambda=(\mathbb Z,+)$ and the grading is in some sense 'compatible' with the one on the polynomial ring after embedding $X$ into affine space, then this would imply that $X$ is a cone, i.e. cut out by homogeneous polynomials. More precisely, assume $\phi:\Bbbk[X_0,\ldots,X_n]\twoheadrightarrow A$ induces a closed immersion $X\hookrightarrow\mathbb A^n$. Then if $\phi$ is a morphism of graded algebras, we know that $\ker(\phi)=I(X)$ is generated by homogeneous polynomials. However, I would like to be able to see this kind of thing from the grading on $A$ in a more intrinsic manner, i.e. without talking about compatibility to some specific embedding into affine space. Is there a result that makes this vague notion of compatibility precise? What other kind of geometrical information can I obtain from properties of a grading on $A$?

&\color{gray}{\verb+C.4.1+}\,\,\,\,\,\text{Equality Constraints}
\end{align}$ We will first focus on linear equality constraints and then generalize to the nonlinear case. Although the philosophy for both cases is the same, it is easier to grasp the basics when linear constraints are involved . Thus the problem is cast as 
$$\text{minimize}\,\,\,\, J(\theta)\\\text{subject to}\,\,\,\,A\theta=b$$
where $A$ is an $m\times l$ matrix and $b$, $\theta$ are $m\times1$ and $l\times 1$ vectors, respectively. It is assumed that the cost function $J(\theta)$ is twice continuously differentiable and it is, in general, a nonlinear function. Furthermore, we assume that the rows of $a$ are linearly independent, hence $A$ has full row rank. This assumption is known as the regularity assumption . Let $\theta_*$ be a local minimizer of $J(\theta)$ over the set $\{\theta:\,A\theta=b\}$. Then it is not difficult to show (e.g.,[Nash 96]) that, at this points, the gradient of $J(\theta)$ is given by

468324,Finding an invisible circle by drawing another line,"A friend of mine taught me the following question. He said he found it in a book a few years ago. Though I've tried to solve it, I'm facing difficulty. Question : You know on a plane there is an invisible circle whose radius is less than or equals $1$. Fortunately, you have already found that the lengths of the chords of a circle by two lines $l_1, l_2$ are $d_1, d_2$ $(2\gt d_1\ge d_2\gt0)\ $respectively. By drawing another line, let's find this circle. If the line you'll draw crosses a circle at two points, then you'll get the length of the chord of a circle by the line. If the line you'll draw and a circle come in contact with each other, then you'll get the coordinates of the point of contact instead of getting $0$ as the length of the chord. If the line you'll draw neither crosses nor comes in contact with any circle, then you'll be able to draw another line just once more. Find the coordinates of the center of a circle. This is all the question says. Could you give me how to find the coordinates? The situation so far : The $l_1\parallel l_2$ case : This case has been already solved (see Blue's answer below). The $l_1\not \parallel l_2$ case : This case has not been solved yet. Supposing that   $l_1:y=x\tanθ$, $l_2:y=-x\tanθ$ and $l_3:y=0$ ($l_4:x=0$ if needed) for $0<θ<\pi/2$, then we can get two possible coordinates as the center of a circle. However, it seems difficult to decide just one coodinates because each line is symmetric about the origin. Hence, a new line, which is not $y=0$, is needed as $l_3$. My approach :
Let each of $l_{1,d+}, l_{1,d-}, l_{2,D+}, l_{2,D-}$ be the followings:$$l_{1,d+}:y=x\tanθ+\frac{d}{\cosθ}, l_{1,d-}:y=x\tanθ-\frac{d}{\cosθ}$$
$$l_{2,D+}:y=-x\tanθ+\frac{D}{\cosθ}, l_{2,D-}:y=-x\tanθ-\frac{D}{\cosθ},$$
where $D=\sqrt{d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2-{d_2}^2}{4}}.$ Note that each distance between $l_1$ and $l_{1,d\pm}$ is $d$, and that each distance between $l_2$ and $l_{2,D\pm}$ is $D$. Also, note the following:
$$\sqrt{\left(\frac{d_1}{2}\right)^2+d^2}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{d_2}{2}\right)^2+D^2}.$$
This means that the radius of a circle which crosses $l_1$ equals the radius of a circle which crosses $l_2$. Note that $d$ must satisfy the following:$$0\le d\le \sqrt{1-\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}}.$$ Then, Letting each of the intersections of $l_{1,d-}$ and $l_{2,D+}$, $l_{1,d+}$ and $l_{2,D+}$, $l_{1,d+}$ and $l_{2,D-}$, $l_{1,d-}$ and $l_{2,D-}$ be $P_{-+}$, $P_{++}$, $P_{+-}$, $P_{--}$ respectively, we can represent these as the follwoings:
$$P_{-+}\ \left(\frac{d+D}{2\sinθ}, \frac{-d+D}{2\cosθ}\right), P_{++}\ \left(\frac{-d+D}{2\sinθ}\frac{d+D}{2\cosθ}\right),$$$$P_{+-}\ \left(\frac{-d-D}{2\sinθ}, \frac{d-D}{2\cosθ}\right), P_{--}\ \left(\frac{d-D}{2\sinθ}, \frac{-d-D}{2\cosθ}\right).$$ Since each radius is $\sqrt{d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}}$, we can represent the circles by $d$ as the followings:
$$C_{-+}:\left(x-\frac{d+D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{-d+D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}$$
$$C_{++}:\left(x-\frac{-d+D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{d+D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}$$
$$C_{+-}:\left(x-\frac{-d-D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{d-D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}$$
$$C_{--}:\left(x-\frac{d-D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{-d-D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}.$$ Changing $d$ to $-d$ in $C_{++}$ gives $C_{-+}$ and changing $d$ to $-d$ in $C_{+-}$ gives $C_{--}$. Hence, we can represent each possible invisible circle by $d$ as the following:
$$C_{\pm+}:\left(x-\frac{-d+D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{d+D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}$$
$$C_{\pm-}:\left(x-\frac{-d-D}{2\sinθ}\right)^2+\left(y-\frac{d-D}{2\cosθ}\right)^2=d^2+\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}$$
for $d$ which satisfies the following:
$$-\sqrt{1-\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}}\le d\le \sqrt{1-\frac{{d_1}^2}{4}}.$$ In addition to this, letting $(x,y)$ be the center of each circle, we get the following:
$$xy=\frac{{d_1}^2-{d_2}^2}{16\cosθ\sinθ}.$$ This shows that the center of each possible invisible circle is on this hyperbola if $d_1-d_2>0$.

468334,An integer counting function n(x),"Counting the number of positive integers ($n(x)$) below a certain number x, is obviously simple and trivial: it is just $x$, however only when $x$ is an integer. In the logarithmic prime counting function $\psi(x) = x - \log(2\pi) - \frac12 \log(1- \frac{1}{x^2})  -  \sum_{\rho} \dfrac{x^{\rho}}{\rho}$, a constant (first term), the infinite sum of trivial zeros (middle term) and the infinite sum of non-trivial zeros (last term) of $\zeta(s)$, nicely account for the gaps between $x$ and $\psi(x)$. This annihilates the approximation errors of $\psi(x)$ at the integers, but also between them and induces the required prime step-function. I wondered if a similar 'bottom up' formula exists, i.e. involving the infinite sums of (complex) zeros (call them $\mu$) of a function. Such formula would then look like: $n(x) = x - c -  \sum_{\mu} \dfrac{x^{\mu}}{\mu}$. At the integers it obviously needs to be zero, but between the integers it needs to sum up an infinite amount of sine waves that then culminates into the saw tooth pattern in the graph below. Does such a function exist? And if so, could it be extended towards counting e.g. only even or only odd numbers? EDIT: The formula for the sawtooth wave in the graph above is easy to derive and is: $$\displaystyle saw(x):=\frac12 - \frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(2nx\pi)}{n}= \frac12 +\frac{i}{2\pi}\ln(e^{-2\pi i (x-\frac12)})$$ However, this does not yet allow me to express $n(x)$ into an infinite sum involving (complex) zeros.",['number-theory']

468358,Finding the most general class of solutions to $x\partial_{y}f = y\partial_{x}f$,"Consider the following PDE for $f(x, y)$:
$$
x\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = y\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\tag{1}

Clearly, one can separate the variables, so take $f(x, y) = p(x)q(y)$:
$$
xp(x)q'(y) = yq(y)p'(x)\implies \frac{p'(x)}{xp(x)}=\frac{q'(x)}{yq(x)}=C
$$
Then:
$$
\frac{p'}{p}=Cx\implies d(\ln p) = d(Cx^2/2)\implies p(x) = e^{Cx^2/2}

Similarly for $y$, so we have that $f(x, y) = e^{C(x^2 + y^2)/2}$. Now here's the thing, one could notice here that in fact $f(x, y) = g(u(x, y)), u(x,y) = C(x^2 + y^2)$ for any $g$ solves the equation as:

468359,Looking for first course textbooks on probability and statistics for math majors,"I am taking a probability and statistics course soon and would like to find a text book that is targeted more towards math majors rather than engineers (which is what this class is). The book my class will officially be using is Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences by Devore (ISBN-13: 978-0538733526). To be clear I have not seen the book yet but for now I am assuming it is not what I am looking for. To give an idea of mathematical maturity and (possibly) relevant background by the time I plan to really start looking through whatever book I end up getting I will be through the integration chapter of Rudin's Principles (ch6), be through a course of point set topology (Topology and Groupoids), and I have familiarity with Linear Algebra (I have been learning from Course of linear algebra and multidimensional geometry by Ruslan Sharipov and getting exercises from various books). I don't have any real specification other than it doesn't focus on ad-hoc calculation skills and has a good amount of theory. Also the book should be a first course book, so it shouldn't assume previous probably and statistics classes. Also the book could be probability or statistics(not necessarily both).  Here are some things that would be nice to have but not necessary:  a book that covers a lot of the material from the book that will be used in the class; a book that has special topics or applications to things like number theory or combinatorics (basically anything separate from probability and statistics); not greater than 500 pages; reasonably priced. There are already many questions that have asked for probability or statistics books, but it is not obvious from the questions and answers (that I have seen) that any of those books fit what I am looking for. It looks like this answer might have what I am looking for but it is hard to tell and its expensive. Edit: 
What am looking for is not necessarily a replacement for this class, I just figure that I might as well learn some probability or statistics at a more sophisticated level while I am taking the required class that I suspect is more focused on calculations.","['statistics', 'reference-request', 'book-recommendation', 'probability']"

However, I don't see where the necessity of $m(E) < \infty$ comes up in the proof. The proofs I have seen all look like: Let $A_n = \{x \in E: |f_n(x) - f(x)| > \epsilon \}$. Then, $\int_E |f_n(x) - f(x)|^p \ge \int_{A_n} |f_n(x) - f(x)|^p \ge \int_{A_n}  \epsilon^p = \epsilon^p m(A_n) \ge 0$ Thus $||f_n - f||_p \rightarrow 0$ implies that lim $m(A_n) = 0$ and hence it converges in measure.

Based on the one answer so far, and the comment, I suspect that this was an incorrect question. It came up from a Qualifying exam I was going over.

As distance travelled by car P between 7:00 to 9:00 (that is 2 hrs ) is $\frac{2\times D}{5} $ so the cars meet at $D_{AR} + \frac{2}{7}\times \frac{2\times D}{5} $ =  $ \frac{18 \times D }{35} $ from city A SO Time is calculated as like To travel D distance if it takes 5 hours , then to travel $ \frac{18 \times D }{35} $ it should take $\displaystyle\frac{5}{D} \times \frac{18D}{35}$ So $\frac{18}{7}$ hours .

468652,Formal definition for indexed family of sets,"Essentially I'd like to know the formal definition of the object $\{A_{i}|i\in I\}$ .This is my context: 1.- From Wikipedia ( Here ) I understand that a family of elements in $S$ indexed by $I$ and denoted by $\{A_{i}|i\in I\}$ is a function $A:I\longrightarrow S$. 2.- From Hrbacek's book (Introduction to set theory): ""We say that $A$ is indexed by $S$ if $A=\{S_{i}|i\in I\}=Ran(S)$, where $S$ is a function on $I$"". Here I understand that I have the function $S:I \longrightarrow A$ and $\{S_{i}|i\in I\}$ is defined as the range of $S$. 3.- From Hagen von Eitzen's answer ( Here ), I understand that a family $\{A_{i}|i\in I \}$ is a function $S:I\longrightarrow A$ and we write $A_{i}$ instead of $S(i)$. So, I'm very confused because these definitions seems to be different to me, or maybe I'm missing something. I don't know. Could you guys help me clarify this? Edit: I intuitively understand the concept. My problem basically is that there are some ""inconsistencies"" that I just don't get in the defintions: In definition $1)$ if $A=\{A_{i}|i\in I\}$ is a function then $\bigcup A=\bigcup \{A_{i}|i\in I\} $. But formally the elements of a function are order pairs and then $\bigcup A$ is a set that doesn't equal the union of all the sets $A_{i}$. In definition $2)$ It's been said that $A$ is indexed by $S$. So here I always thought that a $I$ is the set that index funtions, though here it does make sense to say $\bigcup \{A_{i}|i\in I\}$ because we are talking about the union of all the sets $A_{i}$. When we are talking about sets, the object  $\{A_{i}:i\in I\}$ cannot contain repeated elements, but if we talk about a function it does matter the order and repeatition of elements. So, it's confusing.","['elementary-set-theory', 'definition']"

468658,How common is it for a densely-defined linear functional to be closed?,"I've always held the vague belief that any densely-defined operator encountered ""in nature"", if it isn't bounded, is probably at least closable. But, today I noticed the following thing: Consider the Banach space $C_0(\mathbb{R})$ of continuous, complex-valued function vanishing at $\pm \infty$ in the uniform norm. We have a densely-defined linear functional  $\int : C_c(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{C}$ given by Riemann integrating compactly supported functions. This functional is not closable. Indeed, choose $f \in C_c(\mathbb{R})$ with $\int f = 1$ and put $f_n(t) = (1/n) \cdot f(t/n)$. Then $f_n \to 0$ uniformly, but $\int f_n = 1$ for all $n$. Thus $(0,1)$ belongs to the closure of $\operatorname{Graph}(\int) \subset C_0(\mathbb{R}) \times \mathbb{C}$, and $\overline{\int}$ is not single-valued. This surprised me because integration against an infinite measure is one of the most fundamental examples of an unbounded linear functional. So, if integration is not closed, how ubiquitous could closed linear functionals possibly be? Question: Can you come up with any good ""natural"" examples of densely-defined linear functionals on Banach spaces which are closable? Do you have a sense for how important, or common, such examples are? Or are non-closable functionals the rule rather than the exception?

Suppose $\varphi$ is an involution, so $\varphi^{-1} = \varphi$, and $\varphi = \tau_Q\phi$ as above. What can we say about $\tau_Q$ and $\phi$? If $\phi = \mathrm{id}_E$, then $\varphi = \tau_Q$ where $Q$ is a point of order 2. If $\phi = [-1]$, then $\varphi(P) = Q - P$ for some $Q \in E$. I think that these are the only possibilities, but I don't see how to prove it.
I'm most interested in the case that $k$ has characteristic zero, in which case $[-1]$ is the only isogeny of order 2, because $\mathrm{Aut}(E,O)$ is cyclic of order 2, 4, or 6 (p. 103). Can we somehow prove that $\phi$ can't have an order greater than 2? Then we would be done. Using $\varphi^{-1} = \phi^{-1}\tau_{-Q}$, the condition for $\varphi$ to be an involution becomes $\phi^2(P) + \phi(Q) = P - Q$. This might be helpful, but I am not sure as I am quite sleepy.

$$dF=d(U-ST)=dU-TdS-SdT$$
but I can't get the above result. Here is my reasoning: Choose $S$ and $T$ as independent variables According to the definition of total differential:
$$dF=\frac{\partial (U-ST)}{\partial U}dU+\frac{\partial (U-ST)}{\partial S}dS+\frac{\partial (U-ST)}{\partial T}dT$$
By (2), we know that the value of $U$ depends on $S$ and $T$, so:
$$dF=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial U}-\frac{\partial (ST)}{\partial U}\right)dU+\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}-T\frac{\partial S}{\partial S}\right)dS+\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}-S\frac{\partial T}{\partial T}\right)dT \\
=\left(1-\frac{\partial (ST)}{\partial U}\right)dU+\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}-T\right)dS+\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}-S\right)dT $$
It seems that the author of my book assumed $U$ to be indepedent of $S$ and $T$ to get $\frac{\partial (ST)}{\partial U}=0$, $\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}=0$ and $\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}=0$, but doesn't it contradict assumption (2)? Would you explain to me how can the author obtain his result? Oh! I finally got it! There is no contradiction with assumption (2). I thought there was, just because I didn't pay attention to an important fact: when doing partial differentiation with respect to one variable, the other variables are regarded as constants! Also, as Hurkyl said below, the number of variables doesn't matter at all! Let me try to explain it: Case 1: we treat $F$ as a function of three variables, i.e. $F(U,S,T)$, then we got the following result as I did in my original post:
$$dF=\left(1-\frac{\partial (ST)}{\partial U}\right)dU+\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}-T\right)dS+\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}-S\right)dT$$
but when we are doing partial differentiation of $F(U,S,T)$ with respect to $U$, the other variables, $S$ and $T$, are regarded as constants, so $\frac{\partial (ST)}{\partial U}=0$, similarly, $\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}=0$ ($U$ and $S$ kept constant) and $\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}=0$ ($U$ and $T$ kept constant), so $$dF=(1-0)dU+(0-T)dS+(0-S)dT=dU-TdS-SdT$$
notice that it does not contradict with assumption (2), because the variables are regarded as unrelated just because we are doing partial differentiation, whereas in assumption (2), we are defining $dU$, not doing partial differentiation. Case 2: we treat $F$ as a function of any two variables, not necessarily $S$ and $T$. For example, we treat $F$ as $F(U,S)$, then
$$dF=\left(\frac{\partial (U-ST)}{\partial U}\right)_S dU+\left(\frac{\partial (U-ST)}{\partial S}\right)_U dS$$
notice that in this case, $T$ can not be regarded as constant, because it is not a variable of $F$, but a function of $U$ and $S$, so:
$$dF=\left(1-S\frac{\partial T}{\partial U}\right)dU+\left(-S\frac{\partial T}{\partial S}-T\right)dS \\ 
=dU-S\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial U}dU+\frac{\partial T}{\partial S}dS\right)-TdS \\
=dU-SdT-TdS$$
we can get the same result if we choose any two variables. Case 3: we treat $F$ as a function of one variable, $F(t)$, where $U=U(t)$, $S=S(t)$, $T=T(t)$, in this case we can just use single variable differentiation:
$$\frac{dF}{dt}=\frac{d(U-ST)}{dt}=\frac{dU}{dt}-\left(T\frac{dS}{dt}+S\frac{dT}{dt}\right)$$
multiply the above equation by $dt$, we can get $dF=dU-TdS-SdT$ So, we can get the same result no matter how we choose variables. And it doesn't matter whether the variables are independent or not! We can still have good approximation from the total differential $dF$ (please refer to Mary Boas's Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences , 3rd Edition, p.200 and p.201 problem #8 for an explanation of this). Anyway, thank all of you for sharing your ideas here.","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-derivative']"

As $|g|< \infty$, suppose $|g|=n$ then, $g^n=e=g.g^{n-1}$ So, if we can see that $g^{n-1}$ is in $T(G)$, then we are done as $g^{n-1}$ would be inverse of $g$ in $T(G)$. Now, $(g^{n-1})^n=(g^n)^{n-1}=e^{n-1}=e$. So, $g^{n-1}$ is in $T(G)$ and thus we are done.[we did not use abelian property of G in proving existence of inverse] So, we have $T(G)$ which is closed under group operation and inverse.

468962,Using discrete calculus to study convergence of series and sequences,"From some personal investigation, I've noticed that all convergence tests for infinite series (at least, the real kind) can be rephrased in terms of the discrete derivative $∆f(x)$ of a function $f(x)$, sometimes to give interesting results. For example, the statement:
$$\text{If } \lim_{k → ∞} a_k ≠ 0 \text{ then } ∑a_k \text{ diverges.}$$ Is equivalent to the statement:
$$\text{If } \lim_{x → ∞} ∆f(x) ≠ 0 \text{ then } f(x) \text{ diverges.}$$
Except that the second statement is arguably more general, since $f(x)$ is not explicitly required to be in the form of a sum. Note that the limit of $∆ f(x)$ follows the definition of a limit of a sequence, rather than a function. Another example, is the ratio test which is given:
$$ \text{If } \lim_{k → ∞} \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} < 1 \text{ then } ∑a_k \text{ converges.}$$ This statement is equivalent to:
$$ \text{If } \lim_{x → ∞} \frac{∆^{\!2} f(x)}{∆ f(x)} < 0 \text{ then } f(x) \text{ converges.}$$ Besides said generalization, this representation is also interesting because proving convergence tests in terms of $∆ f(x)$ and $f(x)$ does not require manipulating sums directly. Instead, the proofs can be given in terms of basic theorems about $∆ f(x)$. They generally resemble proofs you'd find in calculus. Is anyone familiar with some thorough treatment of studying infinite series using discrete calculus in this way?","['sequences-and-series', 'discrete-calculus', 'discrete-mathematics']"
468970,Rank of free submodules of a free module over a commutative ring. [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : $A^m\hookrightarrow A^n$ implies $m\leq n$ for a ring $A\neq 0$ (4 answers) Closed 10 years ago . Free modules over a commutative ring $R$ with $1$ have well-defined rank. I have been wondering if there is a ring $R$ such that there are free modules $M'\subset M$ with $\operatorname{rank}(M')>\operatorname{rank}(M)$ for a while, but can't come up with examples or a proof of the contrary in general. All I know is that this never happens if $R$ is a domain, since you can consider $M'$ and $M$ as vector spaces over the fraction field of $R$.","['modules', 'commutative-algebra', 'examples-counterexamples', 'abstract-algebra']"

469085,Convergence of Integral of Matrices,"I have proved the following convergence, but I'm not convinced with my answer. Suppose we have the following $$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \text{tr}\int_{0}^{t}e^{sQ^T}Pe^{sQ} ds$$
where tr is trace. I know $P$ is positive semi-definite, $Q$ is negative-definite. Let the Jordan normal form of $Q$ be $Q = SJS^{-1}$. Step 1 : bring trace inside and use cyclic permutation property $$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \int_{0}^{t}\text{tr}(Pe^{sQ}e^{sQ^T}) ds$$ Step 2 : $P$ is positive semi-definite, $Q$ negative-definite, so $e^{sQ}$ is positive semi-definite. Space of PSD Matrices has an inner product, and tr can be one, so apply Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and get $\text{tr}(Pe^{sQ}e^{sQ^T}) \le \sqrt{\text{tr}(P^2)\text{tr}((e^{sQ}e^{sQ^T})^2)}$. But since they are PSD, we can take out the squares and get $$\text{tr}(Pe^{sQ}e^{sQ^T}) \le \sqrt{\text{tr}(P)^2\text{tr}((e^{sQ}e^{sQ^T}))^2} = {\text{tr}(P)\text{tr}((e^{sQ}e^{sQ^T}))}$$ Step 3 : Take out $\text{tr}(P)$ from the integral $$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \int_{0}^{t}\text{tr}(Pe^{sQ}e^{sQ^T})ds \le \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \text{tr}(P)\int_{0}^{t}\text{tr}(e^{sQ}e^{sQ^T})ds$$ Step 4 : Apply Step 2 to term inside integral
$$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \text{tr}(P)\int_{0}^{t}\text{tr}(e^{sQ}e^{sQ^T}) ds \le \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \text{tr}(P)\int_{0}^{t}\text{tr}(e^{sQ})\text{tr}(e^{sQ^T})ds$$ Step 5 : Trace is sum of eigenvalues $$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \text{tr}(P)\int_{0}^{t}\text{tr}(e^{sQ})\text{tr}(e^{sQ^T})ds  = \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \text{tr}(P)\int_{0}^{t} 2\sum_{i=0}^N e^{s\lambda_i} $$ Step 6 : Swap integral and summation, and integrate $$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \text{tr}(P) 2\sum_{i=0}^N \int_{0}^{t} e^{s\lambda_i} = \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \text{tr}(P) 2\sum_{i=0}^N \frac{e^{t\lambda_i} - 1}{\lambda_i}$$ Step 7 All $\lambda_i < 0$ $\Rightarrow \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} e^{t\lambda_i} \rightarrow 0$. Take out $-1$ from all $\lambda$ and we get $$\le 2*\frac{tr(P)}{|tr(Q)|}$$

469128,Terminology for blow-ups in algebraic geometry,"Definition (from Eisenbud-Harris' Geometry of Schemes): Let $X$ be any scheme, $Y \subset X$ a subscheme. We say that $Y$ is a Cartier subscheme in $X$ if it is locally the zero locus of a single nonzerodivisor. Given a scheme $X$ and a closed subscheme $Z$, is there a common name for the (closed) locus where the ideal sheaf corresponding to $Z$ is not Cartier? My motivation is as follows. Let $X$ be a scheme, $Z$ some closed subscheme, and consider the blowup of $Z$ in $X$. $Z$ is known as the ""center"" of the blowup, and the blowup is guaranteed to be an isomorphism on $U = X \setminus Z$. However, it is certainly possible that there is a larger open subscheme $V$ such that the blowup is an isomorphism over $V$. Indeed, where ever $Z$ is Cartier the blowup will be an isomorphism which is an open subscheme by Nakayama. For example, take the scheme $X = \operatorname{Spec}(k[x,y,z]/(z^2-xy))$ and $Z$ corresponds to the ideal $(x,z)$. Then the blow-up is an isomorphism except at the point corresponding to $(x,y,z)$. In this case, the center of the blow up is the closed subscheme corresponding to $(x,z)$ and my question is what should we call the point corresponding to $(x,y,z)$?","['blowup', 'algebraic-geometry', 'terminology']"
