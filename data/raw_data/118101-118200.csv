1751251,Convergence of the integral $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^3} \mathop{\mathrm{d}x}$,"I want to test the convergence of the integral $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^3} \mathop{\mathrm{d}x}$.
There are some parts of the solution which does not make sense to me, I'm hoping that someone can explain it to me. The solution says: The integrals $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^3} \mathop{\mathrm{d}x}$ and $\int_1^\infty e^{-x^3} \mathop{\mathrm{d}x}$ diverge and converge simultaneously. Therefore, $$\int_1^\infty e^{-x^3} \mathop{\mathrm{d}x} \leq \int_1^\infty e^{-x} \mathop{\mathrm{d}x} = 1.$$
  We conclude that $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^3} \mathop{\mathrm{d}x}$ converges by the comparison principle of Question $11$. For reference, Question $11$ says: Let $f$, $F$ be continuous on $(a,b)$. If the improper integral $\int^b_a F(x) \mathop{\mathrm{d}x}$ converges and $|f(x)| \leq F(x)$ for all $x:a < x < b$, then the improper integral $\int^b_a f(x)$ converges as well. Here $-\infty \leq a < b \leq \infty$. I really feel that the solution has made an error somewhere. $1.$ What does it mean when it says that the integrals diverge and converge simultaneously? $2.$ How does the inequality say anything about the convergence of $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^3} \mathop{\mathrm{d}x}$?","['real-analysis', 'improper-integrals', 'integration', 'convergence-divergence', 'analysis']"

I think that I have to show the relation ""$\leqslant$"" first and then ""$ \geqslant$"" by finding an injective function in both cases.

1751444,Why is $\phi^* g = g$ a PDE for a pseudo-Riemannian metric $g$ on a manifold?,"Given a (locally trivial) bundle $\pi: E \to M$ a PDE of order $k$ is usually defined to be a submanifold of the jet-bundel $J^k(E)$. Now assume $E = M \times M$ and $\pi$ is the projection on the first factor. Thus $J^k(E) = J^k(M,M)$ and local sections of $\pi$ are nothing else than smooth maps $\phi: U \to M$ defined on an open subset of $U \subset M$. Furthermore assume, we have a given metric $g$ on $M$. Now we are interested in all local diffeomorphisms (that is all diffeomorphisms between open subsets of $M$), that act isometrically. In other words: We are looking for local diffeomorphisms $\phi$ for which $\phi^*g = g$ holds. Now everybody (except me!) seems to be sure, that this relation definies a PDE of order 1. Hence my question is: Why is the set $S= \lbrace j^1_p f \in J^1(M,M), (f^*g -g)(p)=0 \rbrace$ a submanifold of $J^1(M,M)$? This cleary links to my former question: Why is a differential equation a submanifold of a jet bundle? (this one beeing an example of the other one): If $\rho: H \to M$ is the bundle of (2,0)-tensors over $M$, we can define a map $D_f: \Gamma_{loc}(\pi) \to \Gamma_{loc}(\rho)$, which takes a local section $\phi$ of $\pi$ to the section $p \to (\phi^*g -g)(p)$ of $\rho$. It is not hard to see, that there is a bundle morphism $f: E=M\times M \to H$ for which $D_f (\phi)(p)=f(j^1_p \phi) $ holds for everey local section $\phi \in \Gamma_{loc}(\pi)$, namly $f(j^k_p \phi)(X,Y)=g_{\phi(p)}(d\phi_p X, d\phi_p Y)-g_p(X,Y)$.
Obviously $S$ ist the preimage of the zero-section in $\rho$ under $f$. But as Anthony Carapetis pointed out in his answer, we need to require something about the rank of the map $f$ for the preimage of a section of $\rho$ to be a submanifold. (Anthony Carapetis asked surjectivity of $Df$ restricted to the vertical bunde, but actually I think constant rank should be enough). Anyhow, I can't figure out, why such a condittion should hold. All of the manifolds and maps in this post are $C^{\infty}$. I'm gratefull for any hint.","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'partial-differential-equations']"

As the two quadratic equations would give four roots i.e. four values I can substitute, I would be able to calculate all the four constant $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$.

1751611,Powers of a function being analytic [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : $f^2$ and $f^3$ are holomorphic implies $f$ is holomorphic. (1 answer) Closed 8 years ago . Question is as follows : Suppose that $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is continuous such that $f^3,f^4$ are analytic in $\mathbb{C}$ then prove that $f$ is analytic in 
$\mathbb{C}$.. Choose $z_0\in \mathbb{C}$. Suppose that $f(z_0)\neq 0$. As $f$ is continuous, in a nbd around $z_0$ the value of $f$ is nonzero. So, $f^4(z)/f^3(z)=f(z)$ in a small open ball centered at $z_0$.. So, $f$ is analytic at $z_0$. Suppose $z_0$ is such that $f(z_0)=0$ then we can not say that $f^4(z)/f^3(z)=f(z)$ for all $z$ in a small open ball around $z_0$ as $f(z_0)=0$ we can not cancel. But then we can certainly say that there is a ball where $f(z)$ is non zero except at $z_0$. Then in this ball we do have that $f^4(z)/f^3(z)=f(z)$. So, $f(z)$ is analytic in punctured disk around $z_0$. I some how feel that function being analytic on punctured disk and function being continuous imply that function is analytic.. Could not figure out the proof for my supposedly correct statement. As $f$ is analytic on punctured disk around $z_0$ we have laurent expansion for $f(z)$ as $$f(z)=\cdots+\frac{a_{-2}}{(z-z_0)^2}+\frac{a_{-1}}{z-z_0}+a_0+a_1(z-z_0)+a_2(z-z_0)^2+\cdots$$ Suppose there is atleast one coefficient of $\dfrac{1}{z-z_0}$ that is non zero, then $|f(z)|\rightarrow \infty$ as $z\rightarrow z_0$.. But then, it is given that $f(z)$ is continuous.. continuous function on compact set is bounded so $f(z)$ has to be bounded on the disk where as we have $|f(z)|\rightarrow \infty$ if atleast one coefficient of negative powers of $(z-z_0)$ is non zero. So, this says all negative powers coefficients are zero.. So, we have $f(z)=a_0+a_1(z-z_0)+a_2(z-z_0)^2+\cdots$ in a nbd around $z_0$. Could not deduce anything from here.

I'm kind of teaching these to myself, and the only examples I've seen with a $0$ in them have involved something like $0< |z+2| <|a|$, or something like that where you'd have to make a substitution $w$... Please let me know how to take care of examples like (a). Also, here are my attempts at parts (b) and (c). Please let me know if they're correct, and if not, let me know what I need to do in order to fix them: (b) $\mathbf{|a|<|z|<|b|}$.

Now, if $|z|> |a|$, then $\left\vert \frac{a}{z}\right\vert< 1$, so we write $\frac{1}{(a-b)(z-a)} = \frac{1}{(a-b)z(1-a/z)} = \frac{1}{a-b}\cdot \frac{1}{z} \cdot \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{a}{z}\right)^{n} = \frac{1}{(a-b)}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{a^{n}}{z^{n+1}}$. If $|z|<|b|$, then $\left\vert \frac{z}{b}\right\vert < 1$, so we write $\displaystyle \frac{-1}{(a-b)}\cdot \frac{1}{(z-b)} = \frac{-1}{(a-b)}\cdot \frac{1}{b\left( \frac{z}{b} - 1 \right)} = \frac{1}{b(a-b)}\frac{1}{1-\frac{z}{b}} = \frac{1}{b(a-b)}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left( \frac{z}{b}\right)^{n} = \frac{1}{(a-b)}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{b^{n+1}}$ So, the whole expansion is $\displaystyle \frac{1}{z-b} \left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{a^{n}}{z^{n+1}} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{b^{n+1}}\right)\\ \displaystyle  = \frac{1}{a-b} \left( \frac{1}{z} + \frac{a}{z^{2}} + \frac{a^{2}}{z^{3}} + \cdots + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{z}{b^{2}}+\frac{z^{2}}{b^{3}}+\cdots\right) \\ \displaystyle =  \frac{1}{z(a-b)} + \frac{a}{z^{2}(a-b)} + \frac{a^{2}}{z^{3}(a-b)} + \cdots + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} + \frac{z}{b^{2}(a-b)}+\frac{z^{2}}{b^{3}(a-b)}+\cdots$ (c) $\mathbf{|b|<|z|}$.  If $|a|<|z|$, we have, as in part (b) $\displaystyle \frac{1}{(a-b)}\frac{1}{(z-a)} = \frac{1}{(a-b)}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{a^{n}}{z^{n+1}}$.

1751791,Why do we like sticking random variables into their own distributions?,"Let $X$ be a random variable taking values in the set $S$. It has some distribution $f(s)$. Often in statistics, we are interested in the real valued random variable $f(X)$. Here are some examples: The value ${\bf E}(\log \frac{1}{f(X)})$ is called entropy and is very important in information theory. If we have a family of distributions $f(s,\theta)$ where $\theta \in \Theta$ is a parameter, then ${\bf E}[(d_{\theta} \log f(X,\theta))^2]$ is called the Fisher information metric which shows up in the Cramer-Rao bound and other places. These examples are enough to convince me that $f(X)$ is extremely fundamental, but without foresight, $f(X)$ seems like a strange object to consider. Is there any way to motivate $f(X)$, where $f$ is the distrubution of $X$ without saying things like ""noisy channel coding theorem"" or ""Cramer-Rao bound""?","['information-theory', 'statistics', 'probability']"

Primarily I want to know why they concluded that ""there is some evidence that there is some difference in mean circulating levels of androgens"" even though the t-statistic 2.06 value falls within the no rejection region $-2.145 < t < 2.145,$ another reason for not rejecting the $H_0$ is because our p-value of 0.6 is greater than our significance level of 0.5. These two things agree with one another to not reject $H_0$ but they still concluded that there is some difference. Or maybe the reason why they said ""there is SOME evidence that there is a difference in mean"" is because the t-value of 2.06 is so close to the critical value of 2.145? Another question I have pertains to to how they got the p-value of 0.6. It has that squiggly equal sign $\approx$ so it means roughly equal to 0.6. I've uploaded the t-distribution table. With $\nu=14$ and we're finding the probability of $T > 2.06.$ Now whatever we get, we need to multiply by 2 since we have a two-tailed test. I found that probability to be between 0.05 and 0.025, indicated with red horizontal and vertical lines. Half way between those two proportion is 0.0375, multiply be 2 (since two-tailed test), which equals to 0.075. Everything is illustrated in both images. Are my assumptions correct?

Since I have these results, I've been given the hint to use Weierstrass Theorem to take the derivative of $\displaystyle \frac{1}{z-a}$. The particular Weierstrass Theorem of which I speak is Weierstrass’ theorem on uniformly convergent series of analytic functions : ""If the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f_{n}(z) = f(z)$ is uniformly
  convergent on every compact subset of a domain $G$, and if every term
  $f_{n}(z)$ is analytic on $G$, then $f(z)$ is analytic on $G$.
  Moreover, the series can be differentiated term by term any number of
  times - i.e., $ \displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f_{n}^{(k)}(z)= f^{(k)}(z)$, $\forall
> z \in G$, $\forall k \geq 0$, and each differentiated series is uniformly convergent on every
  compact subset of $G$."" Do I need to show anything special about $\displaystyle g(z) = \frac{1}{z-a}$ before I can do that here? It's pretty obvious that it's analytic on both of the annuli, so the only problem we might run into is the uniformly convergent part. But it's a geometric series, and those are known to be uniformly convergent, are they not? Once I have made sure all the conditions are met to apply the theorem, then, since the $k-1$st derivative gives us the denominator we want; i.e., $ \displaystyle f^{(k-1)}(z) = \frac{(-1)^{k-1}(k-1)!}{(z-a)^{k}}$, we have, by the theorem that $\displaystyle \frac{1}{(z-a)^{k}}= \frac{-1}{(-1)^{k-1}(k-1)!}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(z^{n})^{(k-1)}}{a^{n+1}}$ (where ^${(k-1)}$ means the $k-1$st derivative) for the annulus $0 < |z|<|a|$. Is this correct? It just looks awfully ugly... So, (1) let me know if I need to prove any conditions in order to use this Weierstrass test, and (2), let me know if I have used it correctly for $0<|z|<|a|$ (I do realize it needs to be simplified a bit and have derivatives taken, but is the gist of what I'm supposed to do correct?)","['derivatives', 'complex-analysis', 'laurent-series', 'complex-numbers']"

1751896,$\epsilon-\delta$ definition for limits involving $\infty$,"For a general limit the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of a limit (the formal definition of a limit) states that $$\lim_{x \ \to \  a} f(x) = L \Leftrightarrow \forall \epsilon > 0 \ (\exists \  \delta > 0  \ : \  (0<|x-a|<\delta \implies |f(x)-L| < \epsilon))$$ However the $\epsilon -\delta$ definition of a limit changes for limits as $x \to +\infty$ and $x \to  -\infty$, and it changes again for limits that evaluate to $+\infty$ and $-\infty$ 1. Limit as $x \to +\infty$ $$\lim_{x \ \to \  +\infty} f(x) = L \Leftrightarrow

While some of these differences might be subtle, it just seems counter-intuitive to change a formal and general definition. I know that the fundamental idea behind the $\epsilon - \delta$ definition remains the same throughout all of these examples (that no matter how small we want to make our ""error distance"" ($\epsilon$) we can always find a ""distance to our limit point"" ($\delta$) that satisfies the definition of a limit) , but to get to that fundamental idea, the $\epsilon - \delta$ definition has to be subtly modified (and I'm not referring to modifications in notation) for each of these examples.

Set $p(x,y)=u(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})$ and $q(x,y)=v(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})$ Then, $$\partial p/\partial x=(\partial u/\partial x)(x/\sqrt{x^2+y^2}),\partial p/\partial y=(\partial u/\partial y)(y/\sqrt{x^2+y^2})$$
and  $$\partial q/\partial x=(\partial v/\partial x)(x/\sqrt{x^2+y^2}),\partial q/\partial y=(\partial v/\partial y)(y/\sqrt{x^2+y^2})$$ Suppose it is holomorphic then it has to satisfy cauchy riemann equations and so we should have
$$x(\partial u/\partial x)=y(\partial v/\partial y),y(\partial u/\partial y)=-x(\partial v/\partial x)$$ After writing this then i realized that $u,v$ are functions of single variable..

Therefore:}\\n = 2m\\\text{Now, working mod 5:}\\2^{2m} + 3^{2m} \equiv 4^m + 9^m \equiv 2 \times(-1)^m \equiv \pm 2 \mod{5}\\\text{However, quadratic residue mod 5 is }0, \pm 1\\\text{As such, } 2^n + 3^n \text{ is never a perfect square.}$ Naturally, I questioned if the $2^n+ 3^n$ is ever a perfect cube, which a friend and I managed to prove was false, by working mod 7 and mod 9, and using Fermat's Last Theorem. This led us to consider the equation $2^n + 3^n = x^p,\,(n,x,p)\in \mathbb{N}^3,\,p\geq2$ and conjectured that there are no solutions. Obviously, if $p$ is composite and there are no solutions for any one of its factors then there are no solutions for p (e.g. $p = 4$ has no solutions because $x^4 = (x^2)^2$, so it is only necessary to consider the cases where $p$ is prime. $p = 5$ was next, and we managed to partially prove it by working mod 11 and 25, and again, Fermat's Last Theorem, leaving only the case $n\equiv 6 \mod{10}$. So my question is: is $2^n + 3^n$ ever a perfect power, and if not, how can this statement be proved?

1752548,Capacity vs measure of a set - intuitive understanding,"There is a concept of measure of ""largeness"" of a set, called capacity. The intuition is, instead of physical largeness (measured by Hausdorff or Lebesgue measure), capacity measures how good a given set is in at holding charge. Analytically, the $2$-capacity of a set $\Omega$ sitting inside a Riemannian manifold $M$ is given by $$cap_2(\Omega) = \inf_{u \in C^\infty_0(M), u|_\Omega \equiv 1} \int_M |\nabla u|^2 dM.$$
In the special case $M = \mathbb{R}^3$, I would like to intuitively understand what large capacity actually means. By the heuristic of ability to contain charge, it seems to me that a disc on the surface of the sphere $S^2$ would have larger capacity than that same (isometric) disc if it were rolled and folded upon itself. As another example, consider a book held open so that the angle between the pages is $180^\circ$. Intuitively it seems that the open surface of the pages now have a higher capacity than if the book were partially closed to make the angle, say, $45^\circ$. Is this intuitive understanding correct? How do I prove these rigorously from the definition?","['real-analysis', 'reference-request', 'potential-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

These functions are different, but it's extremely cumbersome to have to write out this difference every time. (By the way, the context this has come up in has been in thinking about algebraic substructures. For example, if $G$ is a group then there is a binary operation $m$ on $G$ satisfying the usual properties. We'd like to define a subgroup by saying that it is a subset $H$ of $G$ which is a group under the restriction of $m$ to $H \times H$, but unfortunately this restriction is not a binary operation (because it's range is technically still $G$).

The numerical results for $k=2$ and $3$, i.e. $5$ and $7$ bins, are around $0.12$ and $0.13$, respectively (compared to $\frac1{2\pi\sqrt3}\approx0.092$ for $k=1$).

Define the set $E$ to be $E=\cap_{k=1}^{\infty}E_{k}$. If $m(E_{1})<\infty$, show that $m(E)=\lim_{k\to\infty}m(E_{k})$. Show by example that this need not to be the case if we remove the assumption that $m(E_{1})<\infty$. My attempt of proof: Since $E$ is subset of $E_{k}$ for each $k$, then $m(E)\leq m(E_{k})$ - this is according to a theorem stating that Lebesgue measure of a subset is less or equal than Lebesgue measure of its superset. Thus, it's certainly true that $m(E)\leq\lim_{k\to\infty}m(E_{k})$ too. If the limit is 0, then $m(E)$ is equal to the limit, as Lebesgue measure of any set is greater or equal to zero.  However, now I don't see how to eventually prove that $m(E)$ cannot be less that the limit, in case when limit greater than 0.

Question : Does $(x^n)$ converge component-wise with respect to the usual norm? (And if not: Are there simple counter-examples?) Up to now, I know the basics: The case is solved if $d$ is induced by a norm, because all norms on $\mathbb R^N$ are equivalent and $(x^n)$ converges componentwise iff it converges with respect to any $p$-norm. The reverse of my question is not true. If for example $d$ is the discrete metric or the TGV metric, convergence in norm need not to imply convergence in metric. If $\mathbb R^N$ is viewed as a topological space $(\mathbb R^N,\tau)$, then convergence with respect to $\tau$ need not to imply convergence in norm. (E.g. $\tau = \{\emptyset,\mathbb R^N\}$, which is not induced by a metric.) All examples for metrics I considered so far (the usual examples) posess the desired property (and the proofs are easy, as these metrics are defined by using componentwise distances $|x_k-y_k|$). One could say, these metrics are just too normy, but I don't know, if there are not so normy examples or if my question can only be solved in a more abstract way.

     52   1000000 Rules of War: You start with a standard 52-card deck, shuffled, and two players. Distribute 26 cards to each player. Start of a round: Each player displays their top card; the higher rank wins the round, and proceed to the ""Disposition of a round"" step. If there's a tie, proceed to the next step: Each player displays four more cards off the top. Among the respective last cards displayed by each player, the higher rank wins the round, and proceed to the ""Disposition of a round"" step. If there's a tie, repeat this step. If a player has run out of cards, their last card is always the one to compare to the other player's, no matter how many times the other player displays four more cards. If both players have run out of cards and there's a tie, the game is over: it's a draw. [4] Disposition of a round: The winner of the round takes all the cards that have played this round and puts them at the bottom of their set of cards. Note the ambiguity in this last step — I haven't said what order the player should take them in. Indeed, in my experience playing War, there is no rule, and each player can do what they want, including taking them in differing orders during different rounds. For the purposes of this question, I'd be happy with an answer that answers the question according to any rule of your choosing. I don't know what rules war.pl uses (I didn't trace through its dependencies), and you should feel free to use those rules instead of my own. [1] This is unlikely, but let's assume it anyway. [2] I edited the script to not give up after any finite number of turns, but every game ended anyway. I also edited it so it would give me the information noted in the text above. (See the next footnote.) But I didn't change the rules it used for the game. [3] In case anyone is wondering (or finds a bug), here's the script I used. To war.pl I added the line map {$size[$_] = $Hands[$_]->size if $size[$_] < $Hands[$_]->size} keys @Hands to the start of each turn and print $size[$other[$winner]] to sub win . Then in a separate script I collected the $m_i$ s by for (1..1_000_000) {my $score = `perl war.pl`; $scores{$score}++;} and displayed the $w$ s by $\=$/;for my $score (sort{$a<=>$b} keys %scores) {print (($score+1) . ' ' . ((sum0 map { ($_<=$score) * $scores{$_} } keys %scores) / sum0 values %scores))} . [4] I made that rule up for the purposes of this question, so the game is well defined. I don't think it has ever actually come up in my years of playing War, and I don't know what I would do if it did. If you prefer to use a different rule in answering this question, by all means do so.","['combinatorics', 'card-games']"

$$P = \left\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\, \left|\, \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\in\mathbb{N}, \gcd\left(x,y,\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right)=1\right.\right\}$$ (using the convention that $\mathbb{N}$ does not include $0$; i.e., the set of all $(x,y)$, with $x>0$, $y>0$, integers, so that $\left(x,y,\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right)$ forms a primitive Pythagorean triple). Define $\Omega_f$ to be the restriction of $f$ to $P$ (or the image of $P$ under $f$). If $C = \{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2 \mid x> 0,y> 0, x^2+y^2=1\}$ is the segment of the unit circle lying in the first quadrant, and $C_f = \Omega_f \cap C$, then is $C_f \subset C$ dense? Relevant things I have considered: There are (countably) infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples, but this doesn't say anything about their distribution in angle. Equivalently, set $C = \{(\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta))\in\mathbb{R}^2\mid 0< \theta < \pi/2\}$ (note this is the same set as $C$ above). Is the set $\{(\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta))\in \mathbb{R}^2\mid 0<\theta<\pi/2, \cos(\theta)\in\mathbb{Q},\sin(\theta)\in\mathbb{Q}\}$ dense as a subset of $C$? Equivalently, let $P$ be as above.

1752976,posterior probability of bag given ball (evidence),"Question: Given the distribution of the coloured balls in three different bags: - Bag A: 1 Red 2 Black 2 Blue - Bag B: 2 Red 4 Black 4 Blue - Bag C: 10 Red 2 Black 3 Green we carry out two independent experiments: 1) pick a bag, then pick a ball from the chosen bag. 2) pick a ball uniformly and random from all of the 30 balls. We observe that the ball is red (for both experiment). Now, we want to find the posterior probability of ball was taken from bag C given the ball chosen is Red for each of the experiment (i.e. P(Bag C | Red)). My attempt: For Experiment 1: Using Bayes Rule we have: P(Bag C | Red) = P(Bag C and Red) / P(Red) From the distribution, we have P(BagC, Red) = 10/30
Now,P(Red)
= (by law of total probability) sum of conditional probability of
    P(Red | Bag X) * P(Bag X) 
= P(Red|BagC)*P(BagC) + P(Red|BagB)*P(BagB) + P(Red|BagA)*P(BagA)
= (1/3)(10/15) + (1/3)(2/10) + (1/3)(1/5) 
= 16/45

And hence P(BagC|Red) = (10/30) / (16/45) = 15/16 ??? For Experiment 2: this is the part where i am confuse, because intuitively, i dont not see the difference between both question! But i slept over it and think maybe the difference is in the way we calculate P(red), and thats why the following answer: So using the same formula above, but with difference calculation of the probability of getting a red ball from the bag: P(Red) = total number of red / total number of balls = 13/30
Hence, P(BagC|Red) 
= P(Red, BagC) / P(Red) 
= (10/30) / (13/30) 
= 10/13 Intuitively, i thought my answer made sense because if we were to choose a bag first, the probability of the red ball coming from bag C will be larger since the proportion of red balls in bag C is significantly higher. In comparison, if we pick randomly from the pool of 30 balls, the contribution of C into the pool is higher as well (10/13 red balls from C). I am not entirely sure if my approach is correct here, and would wish that you can validate my answers. EDIT: Rectify the error pointed out in the comments","['bayes-theorem', 'probability']"

$$\begin{bmatrix}a &b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\cos x_0\\ \sin x_0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\ 0\end{bmatrix}$$ As $\begin{bmatrix}a &b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}$ is with nonzero determinat $ad-bc$ we see that $\cos x_0=\sin x_0=0$ which is not possible as $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ can not be zero simultaneously. Now, to show that zeros of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ occur alternatively. Suppose $x_0,x_1$ be zeros of $f(x)$ we then have by mean value theorem an element $z_0\in(x_0,x_1)$ such that $f'(z_0)=0$..

Existence of $z_0\in(x_0,x_1)$ with $f'(z_0)=0$ is valid even then $f(x_0)\neq 0\neq f(x_1)$. So, I thought I am neglecting some crucial information by deducing this weak result..

Here's a diagram demonstrating the curved space I'd like to bend/stretch my ellipse into. The white bottom-most curve is the parabolic curve, defined by the function: $$y=-\frac{x(x+30)}{45}$$ The other two green curves are defined as parallel (equidistant) to the parabola at all points, matching the flat rectangles above. As you can see from the diagram, the vertical minor axis for the ellipse becomes slanted, making the top of the ellipse ""longer"" than the bottom of the ellipse - which follows the stretching of the enclosing space. But the ellipse should still touch the top and bottom of the slanted minor axis, as well as touching the left-hand end of the center green curve, which is the transformed major axis for the ellipse.

To this end, we first count the number of sets $B \subseteq A$, with $|B| = n$, and multiply this by the number of onto functions $f \colon A \to B$. This results in the following formula: $$\binom{m}{n}n!{m\brace n}\;.$$ We can now write the following identity: $$m^m = \sum_{n=1}^{m}\binom{m}{n}n!{m\brace n}\;,$$ where $m^m$ is the total number of functions $f \colon A \to A$. Motivation: Let $A$ be a set of size $m$. Pick a random function $g$ from the set $F = \{f \colon A \to A\}$. Let $X_m = \frac{|\text{range}(g)|}{m}$. What is $E[X_m]$? Example: Let $A = \{a,b\}$.
