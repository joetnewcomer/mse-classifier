2451739,Solving the equation $15=|135-60t|$ on $0\le{t}\le{5}$; two possible solutions,"Ann is driving along a highway that passes through Boston. Her distance $d$, in miles, from Boston is given by the equation $d=\vert{135-60t}$| where $t$ is the time in hours since the start of her trip and $0\le{t}\le{5}$. Determine when Ann will be exactly 15 miles from Boston. I have solved the equation $15=|135-60t|$ and I found two solutions by the mean of the absolute value by solving the equation $15=135-60t$ and after the calculation is found that $t=2$; or by solving the equation $-15=135-60t$ and after solving the equation is found that $t=2.5$. I am not clear in understanding the meaning of this exercise. What does the sign minus in the second equation express? When is Ann exactly 15 miles from Boston?

2451789,Why is the domain of $x^2$ the set of all real numbers?,"I try to understand, why domain of $x^2$ is the set of all real numbers. My doubts:
The domain of square root is not defined for negative numbers. Reason to that (If I am not wrong) is that function is supposed to have output with only one input leading to it. Therefore 9 cannot be square-rooted to -3 and 3, only to the positive number (in this case it's 3). Is not the situation with  $x^2$ the same? Should not a domain for it be limited to non-negative numbers? Otherwise, we are having an ambiguity of 3 and -3 leading to 9...","['square-numbers', 'polynomials', 'functions']"
2451796,"$q:X\to Y$ continuous, show that $X$ is compact [duplicate]","This question already has an answer here : Perfect Map $p:\ X\to Y$, $Y$ compact implies $X$ compact (1 answer) Closed 6 years ago . I've been stuck on this problem for a very long time: Problem: Let $X,Y$ be topological spaces, $Y$ compact, and let $q:X\to Y$ be a continuous and closed map. Assume that $q^{-1}(\{y\})$ is compact for every $y\in Y$. Show that $X$ is compact. What I have so far: $q:X\to q(X)$ is also continuous and closed, and $q(X)$ is compact (as a closed subset of a compact space). Thus, we could assume that $q(X)=Y$, or that $q$ is onto $Y$. If $q^{-1}(A)\subset X$ is open, Then $(q^{-1}(A))^c=q^{-1}(A^c)$ is closed, and so ($q$ is onto) $A^c=q(q^{-1}(A^c))$ is closed and $A$ is open. Thus $q$ is a quotient map. Thus, the quotient space $X^*=\{q^{-1}(\{y\})|y\in Y\}$ is compact, as it's homeomorphic to $Y$. How do I carry on from here?","['general-topology', 'compactness']"
2451826,"Probability of ending on a certain point of a circle after randomly moving clockwise or counterclockwise, in succession.","Suppose that $100$ points are equally spaced around a circular path, and at $99$ of these points there are sheep which do not move, and at the other point there is a wolf who will randomly move. Suppose that each time the wolf moves, he will be equally likely to move clockwise by one point or counterclockwise by one point, and if a sheep is at his new location he will eat it. If the wolf continues moving randomly until all of the sheep are eaten, what is the probability that the sheep who is located directly opposite the wolf’s starting point will be the last one eaten? Start at a Solution: I think there would be $2^{99}$ different ways the wolf could move. Consider a more simple situation where there are $8$ points where the wolf starts at point $1$ and the points are numbered $1$-$8$ going clockwise. Then the wolf must end on point $5$. After writing out all the possibilities where it ends on $5$, it appears as if it initially has $2$ numbers to go to, followed by $4,6,6,4,2$. Then maybe with $10$ points it would be $2,4,6,8,8,6,4,2$. So perhaps there is a pattern but I don't know how I'd use it to find a solution. Edit: I think both of my above thoughts are incorrect because from my understanding, the wolf wouldn't skip points where no sheep are present.","['combinatorics', 'statistics', 'probability']"
2451912,"A $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega=\{0,1\}^{\Bbb N}$ strictly smaller than $2^{\Omega}$","Let $\Omega=\{0,1\}^{\Bbb N}$ and $X_n:\Omega\to\{0,1\}$ be the projection onto $n^{\text{th}}$ coordinate, i.e. $X_n(\omega)=\omega_n$ for $\omega=(\omega_1,\omega_2,\dots)$. Consider the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal A:=\sigma\left(\{X_n:n\in\Bbb N\}\right)$ generated by $X_n$'s. How do we show that $\mathcal A\ne 2^{\Omega}$? One way I could think of is to find a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal B$ containing all sets of the form $\{\omega\in\Omega:\omega_n=0\}$ and that $\mathcal B$ is strictly smaller than $2^{\Omega}$. For now I couldn't find such $\mathcal B$ yet. The other way is to write down $\mathcal A$ constructively but that seems even harder. PS : I learned of this statement from a crash course in probability, where a $\sigma$-algebra is thought of as some kind of information available to us, $X_n$ representing the outcome of the $n^{\text{th}}$ coin toss. If that is the case, then doesn't the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal A$ contain all possible events since we know the outcome of every toss ?

2451928,How to evaluate $\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{ - a x } \sinh(\pi x) K_{ix}(b) K_{ix}(c) dx$?,"I'm interested in evaluating the integral  $\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{ - a x } \sinh( \pi x ) K_{ix}(b) K_{ix}(c) \,dx$, where $0 < a < \pi$, and $b, c >0$. I've notice that if I evaluate the following integral then I should be in the clear:
$$
I(A,B,C) \ = \ \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{ - A x } K_{ix}(B) K_{ix}(C)\,dx
$$ Interestingly, in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik (Eq 3 in Ch 6.79) I have encountered the following integral:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{(\pi - \gamma)x} K_{ix+iy}(a) K_{ix+iz}(b) = \pi e^{- \beta y - \alpha z} K_{iy-iz}(c)\,dx
$$ where $0<\gamma<\pi$, and $\alpha, \beta,\gamma$ are the angles of the triangle with sides $a,b,c>0$. This reduces to the following integral more similar to mine:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{(\pi - \gamma)x} K_{ix}(a) K_{ix}(b)\,dx = \pi K_{0}\left(\sqrt{ a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos( \gamma ) } \right)

I just need the limits of integration to match up with mine - I have wasted many hours last night trying to transform this and other integrals in G&R to try and come up with something. Is there any way to do this?

2451977,Proving diffeomorphism invariance of boundary,"I'm trying to follow Lee's book Introduction to Smooth Manifold in details. In chapter 2, Exercise 2.19 asks the reader to prove that if $F:M \to N$ is a smooth diffeomorphism between manifolds with boundary, then $F (\partial M) = \partial N$ . It suffices to show that $F(\partial M) \subseteq \partial N$ . I thought about mimicking the proof given in the book that, in a smooth manifold, a point cannot be a boundary point and be in the domain of an interior chart at the same time (Theorem 1.46). However, I noticed that the argument would rely on knowing forehand that the two manifolds have the same dimension, that is to say their charts map to open subsets of the same $\mathbb{H}^n$ , but it is not clear for me at all that I can assume that. For completeness, a sketch of my proof would go like this: Given $p \in \partial M$ , by definition of $F$ smooth there exists $(U, \phi)$ and $(V, \psi)$ charts such that $F(U) \subseteq V$ and $\hat{F} = \psi \circ F \circ \phi^{-1}$ is smooth. Since $p$ is a boundary point, this means there exists an open set $U_x$ containing $x = \phi(p)$ and $F_x: U_x \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $F_x = F$ in $\phi (U) \subset \mathbb{H}^m$ (and not necessarily $m = n$ ). Now let us suppose that $F(p) \in \mathrm{int} \, M$ . Then, since $F$ is a diffeomorphism (and thus an open mapping), by restricting if necessary we may suppose that $F(U) = V$ . If $G = F^{-1}: N \to M$ , it is known that $\hat{G} = \phi \circ G \circ \psi^{-1}: \psi (V) \to \phi (U)$ is smooth (in the sense of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , because $F(p)$ is an interior point). Now, we may find a ball $B$ around $\psi (F(p)) = \hat{F} (x)$ such that $\hat{G}(B) \subseteq \phi(U) \cap U_x$ . Thus, we could write $$\mathrm{Id}_B = F_x \circ \hat{G} $$ as a composition of smooth functions in the regular sense (defined on open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$ , respectively). The conclusion would follow by noticing that pointwise $DF_x \circ D\hat{G} = \mathrm{Id}$ and thus $D \hat{G}$ is non-singular, but this would only be true if $m = n$ - otherwise I can only conclude it has a left-inverse. I wonder if: there's some independent more basic argument that allows me suppose that $m = n$ right from the start; or the actual proof of this fact goes in a completely different direction, and implies somewhere along the way that $m = n$ . An answer for 1. or a tip for 2. would be appreciated.","['smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'manifolds-with-boundary']"

2452048,"Prob. 8 (b), Sec. 20, in Munkres' TOPOLOGY, 2nd ed: All four topology on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ are distinct","Here is Prob. 8, Sec. 20, in the book Topology by James R. Munkres, 2nd edition: Let $X$ be the subset of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ consisting of all sequences $x$ such that $\sum x_i^2$ converges. Then the formula 
  $$ d( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} ) = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^\infty \left( x_i - y_i \right)^2 \right]^{1/2} $$
  defines a metric on $X$. . . . On $X$ we have the three topologies it inherits from the box, uniform, and product topologies on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. We have also the topology given by the metric $d$, which we call the $\ell^2$-topology. . . . (a) Show that on $X$, we have the inclusions 
  $$ \mbox{ box topology } \supset \ell^2\mbox{-topology } \supset \mbox{ uniform topology}. \tag{0} $$ This I've managed to do. (b) The set $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ of all sequences that are eventually zero is contained in $X$. Show that the four topologies that $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ inherits as a subspace of $X$ are all distinct. My Attempt: The set $\prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/k^3 \right)$, for example, is open in the box topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$; so the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap \left[  \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3 , 1/k^3 \right) \right]$ is open in the corresponding subspace topology on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$; the zero sequence $\mathbb{0} \colon= (0, 0, 0, \ldots)$ is in this set, but for any $\delta > 0$, we note that if $n$ is any natural number such that $n > 2/\delta$, then the element $$\mathbf{x} \colon= \left(\underbrace{ 1/n^3,  \ldots, 1/n^3 }_{n \mbox{ terms } }, 0, 0, 0, \ldots  \right)$$ 
  is in $$ \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, \delta) \colon=  \left\{ \ \mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ d( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) < \delta \ \right\}, $$
  because 
  $$ d ( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n 1/n^3 } = 1/n < \delta/2 < \delta, $$
  but $\mathbf{x} \not\in \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/k^3 \right),$
  because 
  $ 1/n^3 \not\in \left( -1/n^3, 1/n^3 \right)$, 
  and hence 
  $\mathbf{x} \not\in \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap \left[ \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/K^3 \right) \right]$. Thus although $\mathbf{0} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap \left[ \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/K^3 \right) \right]$, no $d$-metric open ball in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ about $\mathbf{0}$ is contained in this set, showing that this set, which is open in the ""box topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ is not open in the ""$\ell^2$-topology"". From part (a), we can conclude that the corresponding subspace topologies on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ also satisfy these very inclusion relations as in (0) above. So we can conclude that on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, the ""box topology"" is strictly finer than the ""$\ell^2$-topology"". Is what I have done so far correct? The set 
  $$ \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, 1 ) = \left\{ \ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ d( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) < 1 \ \right\}$$ 
  is open in the ""$\ell^2$-topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ and contains the point $\mathbf{0}$. However, for any real number $\delta > 0$, if we take a natural number $n > 4/\delta^2$, then the point 
  $$ \mathbf{p} \colon= \left( \underbrace{ \delta/2, \ldots, \delta/2}_{ n \mbox{ terms } }, 0, 0, 0, \ldots \right) $$ 
  is in 
  $$ \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{ \bar{\rho} } ( \mathbf{0}, \delta ) \colon= \left\{ \ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ \bar{\rho} ( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) < \delta \ \right\}, $$
  because 
  $$ \bar{\rho} ( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) \leq \delta/2 < \delta, $$
  but 
  $$ d( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) =  \frac{\delta}{2} \sqrt{ n} > 1,$$
  and so 
  $$ \mathbf{p} \not\in \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, 1 ).$$ Thus, although the point $\mathbf{0}$ is in the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, 1 )$, no $\bar{\rho}$-metric open ball in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ about $\mathbf{0}$ is contained in this set, showing that this set, which is open in the ""$\ell^2$-topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, is not open in the ""$\bar{\rho}$-topology""; therefore the former topology is strictly finer than the latter one. Is this portion of my proof correct? The product topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is the same as the topology induced by the metric $D$ on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ given by the formula
  $$ D ( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} ) = \sup \left\{ \ \frac{ \min \left\{ \ \left\lvert x_n -y_n \right\rvert, \ 1 \ \right\} }{ n } \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}. $$ Now the set $$\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{\bar{\rho}}  ( \mathbf{0}, 1/2 )  \colon= \left\{ \ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ \bar{\rho} ( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) < 1/2 \ \right\}$$
  is open in the ""uniform topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ and contains the point $\mathbf{0}$. However, for any real number $\delta > 0$, if we take $n$ to be any natural number such that $n > 1/\delta$, then the point 
  $$ \mathbf{p} \colon= \left( \underbrace{ 0, \ldots, 0}_{ n-1 \mbox{ terms } }, 1, 0, 0, \ldots \right)$$ 
  is in the set 
  $$\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_D ( \mathbf{0}, \delta) \colon= \left\{ \ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ D( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) < \delta \ \right\}, $$
  because 
  $$ D( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) = \frac{1}{n} < \delta,  $$
  but 
  $$ \bar{\rho}( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) = 1 > \frac{1}{2} $$
  so that 
  $$ \mathbf{p} \not\in \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{\bar{\rho}} (\mathbf{0}, 1/2 ),$$
  thus showing that, although the point $\mathbf{0}$ is in the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{\bar{\rho}} (\mathbf{0} , 1/2 )$, for no $\delta > 0$ is the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_D ( \mathbf{0}, \delta)$ contained in 
   $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{\bar{\rho}} (\mathbf{0} , 1/2 )$. Thus the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{\bar{\rho}} (\mathbf{0} , 1/2 )$, which is open in the ""unifrom topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, is not open in the ""product topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$. Since the uniform topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is (strictly) finer than the product topology (i.e. the $D$-metric topology) on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, so the subspace topology on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ corresponding to the former topology is finer than the subspace topology corresponding to the latter, and, on the basis of what we have shown in the last few paragraphs, the ""unifrom topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ is strictly finer than the ""product topology"". Is this part of my proof correct? Therefore, we have shown that all the four topologies in question are distinct. Is my proof accurate? If so, is my presentation clear enough too?","['product-space', 'general-topology', 'proof-verification']"

After this, I concluded that there might not be any more solutions, because $$\lim_{x\to \infty} (4*\frac{x}{x-7}) = 4*1=4,$$ and that means that when $x$ is another multiple of $7$, $y$ will never equal $4$. However, how can I prove that there are no other solutions rigorously, without checking each number case by case? Is there a way to find the total number of integer solutions without knowing what they are?","['number-theory', 'proof-verification']"
2452189,Defining a probability on the natural numbers set,"The standard definition of a probability on a set A is as a sigma-additive function from a sigma-algebra constructed on the power set of A to the extended real positive line (also called a measure), such that the measure of the whole set A is 1. If A is the set of real numbers, such a definition cannot be made in such a way that any set consisting of only one natural number has equal probability, for, if mu({n}) = c > 0 for any n natural (where mu is the measure), then any infinite set would have infinite measure, and, in particular, mu(A) != 1. But it is trully natural to think, for example, about the probability of certain events relating to the choice of a random natural number, such as the probability of getting an even number out of a random choice of a natural number, which would be 1/2. This kind of probability should satisfy the above condition of having odds 0 of getting any particular natural number. I searched the forum and saw that many people work with probability on the natural numbers by relaxing the assumption of the probability being sigma-additive to just being additive. This seems to solve the problem, although I still didn't find an algebra and a probability function which would seem satisfying (but I guess it is not so hard). The question, then, is what exactly one misses when relaxing the assumption of sigma-additivity. Does a definition of probability in the subsets of natural numbers via a finitely additive set function lead to inconsistencies? What theorems about probability stop applying under such a definition? Also, am I being to restrictive in my general definition of probability, and is it acceptable in modern mathematical culture to define probabilities via only finitely aditive functions?","['probability', 'measure-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"
2452192,How to improve at combinatorics?,"I'm currently learning some basic combinatoric techniques in a class called ""Intro to Combinatorics"", and while all the material makes perfect sense and the steps are always clear after-the-fact, I cannot for the life of me seem to derive anything on my own. As an example, we were learning about using bijections to show that two sets have equal cardinality. If you have a set $A$, which is difficult to count, and a set $B$ which is easy to count, and a bijection $f:A\to B$, then $\|A\| = \|B\|$. So here's an example problem on one of the assignments: Show that the number of $k$-multisubsets of $[n]=\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ is 
  $$
{n+k-1\choose k}
$$
  where a $k$-multisubset of $[n]$ is a $k$-tuple $(a_1,\cdots, a_k)$ with $a_i\in[n]$, and $1\le a_i\le a_{i+1}\le n$. I toiled over this for a while , but I simply couldn't find a bijection between the set of $k$-multisubsets of $[n]$ and the set of $k$-subsets of $[n+k-1]$. I listed out tons of cases, stretched my imagination to come up with any and all ideas I could, but nothing worked in general, it only worked for ""that case"". Then, I asked a friend, and the answer is apparently this: $$
f(\vec a) = \vec a + (0, 1, 2,\cdots, k - 1)
$$
(where the result is interpreted as a set). After the fact, it seems so obvious that this should be the result (or that the bijection should look something like this). The basic idea of this bijection is to ""remove"" the cases where $a_i = a_{i+1}$. I recognized that I had to remove that restriction, but I kept thinking of ""bijections"" $f(a)\to b$ where if $a_i = a_{i+1}$ then $b_i = b_{i+1}-1$ (working incrementally, so that if $a_i = a_{i+1} = a_{i+2}$ then $b_i = b_{i+1}-1 = b_{i+2}-2$), but this didn't work. Here's another example of something we did in class: find the number of partitions of $n$ with parts in $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$. The solution is to denote $S = \{\emptyset\}\cup A\cup A^2\cup A^3\cup\cdots$, and then define a weight function $w:S\to\mathbb{N}$ by $w(\alpha) = \sum_{a\in\alpha}a$ (and $w(\emptyset) = 0$). Then the number of partitions of $n$ with parts in $A$ is given by $\|\{a\in S\ |\ w(a)=n\}\|$, which is also given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
[x^n]\sum_{a\in S}x^{w(a)} & = [x^n]\sum_{k\ge 0}\sum_{a\in A^k}x^{w(a)} \\
& = [x^n]\sum_{k\ge0}\left(\sum_{a\in A}x^{w(a)}\right)^k \\
& = [x^n]\left(1-\sum_{a\in A}x^{w(a)}\right)^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$
I completely understand the machinery at play here, and have no qualms with the derivation of this result. In class we even did examples such as when $A = \mathbb{N}\backslash\{3\}$, and I have no problem. However, now I'm confronted with this problem: Determine the number $c_n$ of compositions of $n$ in which there are no consecutive pairs of even parts using generating functions. ...and I'm completely and utterly lost. I don't know where to start. I can't use the same idea as in the previous proof, since we can't describe the set $S$ of partitions with no consecutive even parts as a set of combinations with elements in some $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$. I do know that 
$$
c_n = [x^n]\sum_{s\in S} x^{w(s)}
$$
but from here I have absolutely no ideas. I have to know something about $S$ in a sense, so I can manipulate this generating function and turn it into something else, but exactly what piece of information I need to know about $S$ is beyond me. Maybe a bijection from $S$ onto itself in some weird way, like $A\mapsto A\times B\backslash C$ where $B$ and $C$ are other sets, and then I can derive a functional equation for this generating function? As for what bijection I even could derive, I have absolutely no idea. I've listed out the elements of $S$ for $n = 0$ to $7$ and can't see any patterns. So, I hope I've demonstrated where my lack of understanding in combinatorics arises; I can't see the steps to take. I can't see the patterns at all, and I can't make the logical connections necessary to manipulate things in useful ways (such as the generating function above). This is actually quite a shock to me, I thought I would've been at least ok at combinatorics. I've never had any of these problems in functional analysis, complex analysis, calculus, number theory, linear algebra, abstract algebra, general topology... So what's the deal with combinatorics? Why is it so ""distant"" and esoteric, and what can I do to improve?","['combinatorics', 'self-learning']"

Suppose $f$ is a continuous differentiable function on the interval $[a,b]$ then there exists some $c\in(a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$. Proof: Let $B=\{e_1,e_2\}$ be the standard basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then let $\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\right)$, that is, the angle that the secant line forms with the $x$-axis.

T = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta

$$ Then $T(B)$ is a basis one of whose component vectors is parallel with the secant line. Thus we may apply Rolle's theorem and the result follows. $\blacksquare$ My thinking here is that by rotating the basis vectors we can just consider it as $f(a)=f(b)$ and Rolle's theorem gives it to us right away then.

2453039,Expected value of PMF,"I am stuck on this question, would appreciate any hints for how to start: Let X have PMF
$$P(X = k) = \frac{cp^k}{k} for\:k = 1,2,...,$$

Find the mean and variance of X. Now, this might be silly - but I'm a little confused by the statement 
""as seen from the Taylor series"". However, I proceeded as such: $$E(X) = cp + \frac{cp^2}{2} + \frac{cp^3}{3} + \frac{cp^4}{4} + ... $$ If we factor out c and p , we get: $$E(X) = cp \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (1+\frac{p^{k-1}}{k}) $$ Does anyone have tips for proceeding? Update I computed E(X) as such: $$E(X) = \frac{-1}{log(1-p)}\frac{p}{1-p}$$ Now I'm having trouble with finding Var(X), namely the first component, E(X^2). Here are the steps I've done: $$E(X^2) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}k^2P(X=k) =  \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}k^2\; \cdot c \; \cdot\frac{p^k}{k} = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}kcp^k $$ $$cp\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}kp^{k-1} = \frac{1}{1-p}$$ $$cp\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}k^2p^{k-2} = \frac{1}{(1-p)^2}$$ $$E(X^2) = c\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}k^2p^{k} = \frac{p}{(1-p)^2}$$ Therefore our entire expression is: $$E(X^2) = \frac{-1}{log(1-p)}\frac{p}{(1-p)^2}$$ Is this the correct expression for E(X^2)?

We are given with the following relations:- $$u^3+v^3=x+y\tag{1}$$
$u^2+v^2=x^3+y^3\tag{2}$ On partially differentiating the above given relations we have, $$3u^2\frac{\partial u}{\partial{x}}+3v^2\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}=1\tag{3}$$
$$2u\frac{\partial u}{\partial{x}}+2v\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}=3x^2\tag{4}$$ The equations $(3)$ and $(4)$ can be written as a matrix as follows
$$\begin{bmatrix}
3u^2 & 3v^2\\
2u & 2v
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}\\
\dfrac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}

2v & -2u\\

\implies

\end{bmatrix}=
\dfrac{1}{6uv(u-v)}\begin{bmatrix}
2v-6ux^2\\
9u^2x^2-3v^2

$$ So, we get $$\dfrac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}=\dfrac{2v-6ux^2}{6uv(u-v)}\\
\&\\
\dfrac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}=\dfrac{9u^2x^2-3v^2}{6uv(u-v)}$$ And due to the symmetry in the equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, we get $$\dfrac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}=\dfrac{2v-6uy^2}{6uv(u-v)}\\
\&\\
\dfrac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}}=\dfrac{9u^2y^2-3v^2}{6uv(u-v)}$$ So, we get the Jacobian determinant as $$\frac{\partial(u,v)}{\partial(x,y)}=

2453484,$P$ is a prime ideal of $R$ iff $R/P$ is an integral domain. : $P≠R$,"Here is the theorem and proof in my textbook. Thm. Let $P$ be an ideal of a commutative ring $R$ with identity $1$.  Then $P$ is a prime ideal of $R$ if and only if $R/P$ is an integral domain. Proof. Suppose that $P$ is a prime ideal of a commutative ring $R$ with $1$. 
Then $P$≠$R$ implies $1+P≠0+P$.
Hence $R/P$ is a commutative ring $R$ with identity. 
Assume that $(a+P)(b+P)=0+P$. 
Then $ab+P=0+P$ and $ab∈P$. 
By the definition of a prime ideal P we get $a∈P$ or $b∈P$. 
That is, $a+P=0+P$ or $b+P=0+P$. 
Thus $R/P$ is an integral domain. Conversely, if $R/P$ is an integral domain, then $1+P≠0+P$ and $R/P$ is a commutative ring $R$ which has no zero divisors. 
Hence $P≠R$. 
Assume $ab∈P$. 
Then $ab+P=0+P$ and $(a+P)(b+P)=0+P$. 
Since $R/P$ is an integral domain, we get $a+P=0+P$ or $b+P=0+P$. 
So $a∈P$ or $b∈P$. 
Thus $P$ is a prime ideal. I am having problems understanding proof with ""Conversely, if $R/P$ is an integral domain, then $1+P≠0+P$."". I know that $R/P$ has an identity. (cause it is ID) But, why doesn't ""$P$"" have an identity? Isn't there a case $P=R$? Please help me understanding.

Edit: My main question is really not about the inequality, but rather about the equation I got: $$x^\frac{1}{x} + x^{1+\frac{1}{x}} = 1/3$$ is it possible to solve it by taking logs and such? Can't wrap my head around it! Edit 2: Turns out there's a special function for this kind of equations, called Lambert W , which is an inverse of $f(z)=ze^z$! So the answer to my question is no, I cannot solve it with my high-school level math chops!","['algebra-precalculus', 'inequality']"
2454325,Finding $g(x)$ if $f(x) = 2x + 1$ and $g(f(x)) = 4x^2 + 4x + 3$.,"I got this question for my homework in Integrated Math 3+ (IB system). If $f(x) = 2x + 1$ and $g(f(x)) = 4x^2 + 4x + 3$, find $g(x)$? I understand how this works, whereas $f(x)$ is being inputted into $g(x)$. I can also solve this by simply looking at it and doing it in my head: the answer is $x^2 + 2$ However, what would be the complete equation and solving method used to find this answer? I am eager to know because I assume a much more difficult question will appear on the test, so I need to know how to properly solve it if i can't do it in my head.","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions']"
