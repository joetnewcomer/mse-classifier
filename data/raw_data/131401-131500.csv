2053777,How should we understand change of the basis matrix?,"I'm rather new to linear algebra and my professor isn't very clear, so although this question may seem ""too easy"" for MSE it would be of great help to me! I'm trying to understand the concept behind a change of basis matrix. Let's say we have some $m \times n$ matrix $A$, formed by a basis $\alpha$. This means that all the columns of $A$ are a linear combination of elements of $\alpha$, right? And if we want a change of basis to $\beta$, we're essentially finding $[A]_\beta$, right? And, the thought behind this is ""reforming"" the columns of $A$ with respect to the basis $\beta$? And, to do this, we take the elements of $\beta$ as columns of a new matrix $C$, then multiply it by the coordinates of $A$ w.r.t. $\beta$? Am I on the right track to understanding this, or am I mistaken?","['matrices', 'change-of-basis', 'linear-algebra']"

2053947,How to show that $f$ and $\mathcal{F}(f)$ can't both be compactly supported?,"Let $f : \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous, I want to show that it can't happen that both $f$ and its Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}(f)$ are compactly supported unless $f = 0$. That means that I want to show that if both $f$ and $\mathcal{F}(f)$ are compactly supported, $f = 0$. I've seem some questions like this here, but I believe this is not duplicate. That because on those questions I've seem people using the Fourier series , while here I'm talking about the Fourier transform. In the Fourier series we require $f$ to be periodic. Here $f$ needs not to be periodic. In that case, I can't restrict $f$ to $[-\pi,\pi]$ and talk about its Fourier series, because it need not be the case that $f(-\pi)=f(\pi)$, since $f$ is arbitrary. Now, if $f$ is compactly supported, there's an interval $[a,b]$ such that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x\notin [a,b]$. If $\mathcal{F}(f)$ also is compactly supported there's $[c,d]$ such that $\mathcal{F}(f)(\xi)=0$ if $\xi\notin [c,d]$. I've then thought of two approaches: Try to use this together with the Fourier inversion formula, to show that $f(x) = 0$. Try to use this together with Plancherel's theorem to show that $\|f\|_2 =0$ and hence $f = 0$. Now, in the first case I get $$f(x)=\int_{c}^{d}\mathcal{F}(f)(\xi)e^{2\pi i x\xi}d\xi = \int_c^d \int_a^b f(y)e^{-2\pi i y\xi}e^{2\pi ix\xi} dyd\xi$$ Or yet $$f(x)=\int_a^b f(y)\int_c^d e^{2\pi i\xi (x-y)}d\xi dy,$$ but this doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Plancherel's theorem also doesn't seem of great aid here. We have $$\int_a^b |f(x)|^2 dx = \int_c^d |\mathcal{F}(f)(\xi)|^2 d\xi,$$ which doesn't help much indeed.

Till now, I am able to construct a continuous map from $S^2$ to closed unit disk in $\mathbb{R^2}$( from projection map from $\mathbb{R^3}$ to $\mathbb{R^2}$). Continuous map from closed unit disc to unit circle is defined in the following way: First we construct an onto map $f$ from closed unit disc to $\mathbb{R}\cup \{\infty\}$. $f(x,y)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-\frac{1}{2}}$ if $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\neq\frac{1}{2}$ and $f(x,y)=\infty$ if $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\frac{1}{2}$.

An equivalent formulation is to look at the $\frac14$ blowup of the square and ask whether we can fit 9 circles with radius $\frac14$ in it or not. Moreover, the pigeonhole principle seems intuitively to be too weak for proving this, because if the shapes will be disjoint then each will have area around $\frac18$ and for, say, squares diameter half enforces area exactly $\frac18$, but we can't fit 8 such squares without gaps.","['packing-problem', 'recreational-mathematics', 'euclidean-geometry', 'geometry']"

I have started by setting S=the set of all integers whose digits are 6,7, or 8. From there I am not too sure what function to define. From this set S to what other set? And I know I would also have to show a function the other way around; in both cases one-to-one functions. I am more concerned as to how to go about setting this up.

2054563,"Some confusion about what a function ""really is"".","Despite my username, my background is mostly in functional analysis where (at least to my understanding), a function $f$ is considered as a mathematical object in its own right distinctly different from the values it takes under point evaluation (i.e. $f(x)$). Another way of stating this is that the possible values of a function under evaluation are properties of the function, when considered as its own mathematical object. However, I am reading a book about the foundations of mathematics by Kunen and he refers to a function as being identified with its graph (i.e. a set of ordered pairs) in axiomatic set theory. I was under the impression that this definition of a function as a set of ordered pairs was an oversimplification that teachers used in high school that one grew out of past calculus. So anyways, what is the most fundamental definition of a function? Obviously we all (students of mathematics) know what a function is intuitively but formally, I have a hard time swallowing the idea that a function is the same thing as its graph. I realize that the whole point of axiomatic set theory is to make it possible to denominate every mathematical object in terms of sets but I find this definition to be particularly disappointing. I suspect that this is one of those things that just depends on what area one chooses to work in but I'd love to see what thoughts some of the more experienced mathematicians on here can offer.","['functions', 'foundations', 'elementary-set-theory', 'definition', 'philosophy']"
2054592,Do Bernoulli random variables always satisfy the Lyapunov condition?,"It seems to me that the Lyapunov CLT condition holds for any sequence of independent Bernoulli random variables $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$ no matter how they are distributed.
Restating the condition says that we can apply the CLT if there exists a $\delta>0$ such that
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{s^{2+\delta}} \sum_{i=1}^n E[ |X_i - E[X_i]|^{2+\delta}] = 0,
$$
where $s = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n Var[X_i]}$. 
For every $i$ and probability $p_i = Pr[X_i=1]$, setting $\delta=1$ shows that

2054623,On the definition of trigonometric functions in the right triangle.,"The question is the following: what are the principal reasons to define the sine, cosine, etc., of an angle, in terms of the right triangle and not, for example, in terms of an obtuse triangle? 1) Is the pythagorean theorem a good reason for using a right triangle? Why? Also, is it true that the ratios of sides of a triangle are always functions of the angle, or this is only true in right-angled ones? 2) Also, I think that, if we define the trigonometric functions in terms of ratios of the sides, we need the right triangle, because it's the only triangle for which their sides can be localized. For example, if we have an obtuse or acute triangle, we cannot determine what is the adjacent side to the angle $A$, because there are two sides who satisfies that property, but in the right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is always bigger and hence clearly distinguishable of the adjacent side of the angle $A$. Is this a good reason to prefer the right angles triangles to define the trigonometric ratios? Also, every triangle can be decomposed into two right angled triangles. Is this also a good reason to prefer right triangles, or also any triangle can be decomposed into an obtuse triangle?","['trigonometry', 'triangles', 'geometry']"

2054654,Risk and Die-Rolling Probabilities,"If you aren't familiar with Risk, here is a short description of how the game works: In the game of Risk, players control countries by occupying them with a variable number of “armies.”  The object is to gain more territory by conducting battles between neighboring countries.  A battle consists of the armies of a single country going against an opponent’s armies occupying a neighboring country.  The battle progresses by each player rolling a prescribed number of dice, and applying rules to determine from the outcome how many armies are lost for each player.  The dice are rolled repeatedly until either the defender loses all his armies (in which case the attacker can occupy the disputed country), or until the attacker is reduced to a single army (in which case there is no army to spare for occupying the opponent’s country).  An attacker can never lose control of his own country.  The battle may also be stopped at any prior time at the attacker’s discretion. The rules for determining how many dice a player may shake are as follows: The attacker may shake one less die than the number of armies on his country, to a maximum of three. The defender may shake as many dice as the number of armies on his country, to a maximum of two. The rules for deciding the outcome of a particular throw of the dice are as follows: The highest attacker die is compared against the highest defender die.  Whoever has the lower number loses one army.  Ties go to the defender. The procedure is repeated for the second-highest dice. In cases where either the attacker or the defender only rolls a single die, a total of only one army will be lost; in all other cases a total of two armies will be lost. For the 1-1 die rolling situation, it is easy to determine that the probability of winning one battle is 15/16. How can I determine probabilities for the other scenarios? Do I have to brute force the calculation (which wouldn't be hard if I were to use python), or does there exist a mathematical way to determine the probabilities of the attacking side winning?",['probability']

Does it have a name?  It is similar to harmonic mean with the difference that the numerator is one rather than the number of terms. Can it be called harmonic sum?  I think it stands to reason that since: you can replace $n$ series resistors with $n$ equal resistors having resistance equal to the mean of those resistors, you can replace $n$ parallel resistors with $n$ equal reistors having resistance equal to the harmonic mean of those resistance, and you can replace $n$ series resistor with 1 resistor having resistance equal to the sum of those resistors, then — by analogy — you should be able to replace $n$ parallel resistors with 1 resistor having resistance equal to the “harmonic sum” of those resistors. That is, mean is to harmonic mean as sum is to “ harmonic sum ”.",['functions']

Prove that all the coefficients of the expansion of the Newtonian binomial $(a+b)^n$ are odd if and only if $n$ is of the form $2^k-1$. Why in the solution below do they take $n > 8$? Also, I don't get the middle paragraph argument about $n_1$. What do those values represent using $n_1$? Solution: For $n \leq 8$ the theorem is immediately verifiable. It is therefore sufficient to assume that the theorem is true for the binomials $a+b,(a+b)^2,\ldots,(a+b)^{n-1}$ for $n > 8$, and prove that the theorem holds for $(a+b)^n$. The coefficients of the binomial expansion (except for the extreme ones both equal to $1$) are $$\dfrac{n}{1}, \dfrac{n(n-1)}{1 \cdot 2},\ldots,\dfrac{n(n-1) \cdots 1}{1 \cdot 2 \cdots (n-1)}.$$ A necessary and sufficient condition in order that all these numbers be odd is that $n$ is odd and the numbers obtained by deleting the odd factors from the numerators and denominators of the remaining numbers be odd. But setting $n = 2n_1+1$ these numbers can be represented by the terms of the sequence $$\dfrac{n_1}{1},\dfrac{n_1(n_1-1)}{1 \cdot 2}, \ldots, \dfrac{n_1(n_1-1) \cdots 1}{1 \cdot 2 \cdots (n_1-1)}.$$ Since $n_1 < n$, the latter are all odd if and only if $n_1$ is of the form $2^k-1$, i.e. if and only if $n$ is of the form $2(2^k-1)+1 = 2^{k+1}-1$.",['number-theory']

2055146,Lipschitz Implicit Function,"I am reading a paper entitles ""Sphere Tracing: a Robust Antialiased Rendering of Distance Based Implicit Surfaces"" , written by John C. Hart. Here are some definitions: Surfaces/shapes can be defined implicitly. An implicit function is a continuous mapping $f$ : $R^n \rightarrow R$ that describes the set $A \subset R^n$ as the locus of points: $A \equiv \{ x : f(x) \le 0\}.$ The boundary of the surface may be denoted $f^{-1}(0)$ . Distance to a set. The distance $d(x,A)$ from a point $x \in R^3$ to a closed set $A \subset R^3$ is given by $d(x,A) = \min_{y \in A}||x - y||.$ Then Hart writes that if you have $|f(x)| = |d(x, f^{-1}(0))|$ (eq. 1) then you have what he calls a distance implicit function or DIF. And if you have $|f(x)| \le |d(x, f^{-1}(0))|$ then you have distance underestimate implicit function or DUF. I don't want to get into the details of why he is interested in the DUF type of function but in short within the context of ray-tracing (in computer graphics) this helps the process of finding if a ray (defined by an origin and a direction) intersects surfaces (which can be defined implicitly in this case). The property of DUF functions is that they guarantee to return a distance to the surface from a given point $x$ within which the ray ""cannot interest the surface or can intersect the surface (where the intersection point is exactly on the surface)"" but in no circumstance can overshoot the surface. That's just to provide some context to my questions. Then he goes on defining Lipschitz implicit functions or LIF. It is an implicit function such that $|f(x) - f(y)| \le \lambda ||x-y||$ (eq. 2) for some positive constant $\lambda$ . This constant is denoted the Lipschitz constant and is written as $Lip \; f$ . Any LIF can be made into a DUF. Let $f$ be a LIF with Lipschitz constant $\lambda$ . Let $y \in f^{-1}(0)$ be one of the points such that: $||x -y|| = d(x, f^{-1}(0))$ (eq. 3). Then by eq. 2 $|f(x)| \le Lip \; f \; d(x, f^{-1}(0)).$ Hence, $f(x)/ Lip \; f$ is a DUF for any LIF $f$ . QUESTIONS: I believe that Hart's point is to show that if an implicit function is a Lipschitz function, then it has a DUF, and thus this DUF can be used later on to compute the ""underestimate"" distance of a ray's origin to a given surface. Okay I get that. The proof from his paper is something I hope I understand as well: $\lambda ||x-y|| \ge |f(x) - f(y)|\\$ then replace $||x-y||$ by $d(x,f^{-1}(0))$ (eq. 3) $\lambda \; d(x,f^{-1}(0)) \ge |f(x) - f(y)|\\$ $f(y)=0$ in this particular case since $y \in A$ thus we can re-write: $\lambda \; d(x,f^{-1}(0)) \ge |f(x)|\\$ and finally: $ \dfrac {f(x)}{\lambda} \le d(x,f^{-1}(0))$ If this correct? Finally, this is the part where I am the most interested in an explanation. Hart writes: The Lipschitz constant of a continuous function is its maximum slope. The maximum slope can be found by setting the function's second derivative equal to zero and solving for x. Since x is a vector, these derivatives can be the squared magnitude of the gradient. Could someone explain me this part with possibly an example? (using a real function) PS: as a helper later on in the paper Hart uses the function: $C(r) = 2 r^3/R^3 - 3r^2/R^2 + 1$ then he computes the first and second derivative: $C'(r) = 6r^2/R^3 - 6r/R^2$ and $C''(r) = 12r/R^3 - 6/R^2.$ Setting C''(r) = 0 yield the max slope, which occurs at the midpoint r=R/2, which is C'(R/2) = -3/2R = Lip C(r). I really don't understand this at all. Could someone please explain? EDIT I believe I understand most of it myself now. The paper says the Lipschitz constant is equal to the maxima of the function which you can find if you know the second derivative of that function and solve for f''(x) = 0. So it would be great to learn/know how I can explain this property. So I understand how Hart finds the value of $r=R/2$ for C''(r) but why do we re-inject this value in C'(r) ( $C'(R/2)$ ) in order to find about the value of Lip C(r)? Is that because: $\lambda = \dfrac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{||x - y||}.$ Can be assumed as the first order derivative of the function f(x)?","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'implicit-differentiation']"

2055535,Cat dead or alive?,"You put a cat into a toxic box, it might be dead or alive after an
  hour. Two witches $A$ and $B$ have the ability to predict the status of the cat
  with the accuracy of $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively.Suppose their prediction are independent. Both of them claim
  that they ""see"" the cat is still alive in the future. Question: from
  their words, can you calculate the probability that the cat is still
  alive after an hour? I have two solutions, I am so confused about them, especially the second one, please have patience and feel my confusion. Solution 1 Two possibilities: $A$ right, $B$ right, so cat is alive $A$ wrong, $B$ wrong, so cat is dead One right and one wrong is impossible, therefore the probability that the cat is alive $p_1p_2/(p_1p_2+(1-p_1)(1-p_2))$ Solution 2 I will translate A has the accuracy of $p_1$ to
$$
p_1 = P(L)P(A_L|L)+P(D)P(A_D|D)
$$
above formula says if the cat is alive, $A$ predict it is alive; if the cat is dead, $A$ predict it is dead. Similarly:
$$
p_2 = P(L)P(B_L|L)+P(D)P(B_D|D)
$$
Because the cat is either alive or dead, so $P(L)+P(D)=1$ We want to calculate the probability that the cat is alive based on the words of $A$ and $B$: $$
P(L|A_L,B_L) = \frac{P(A_L,B_L|L)P(L)}{P(A_L,B_L)} = \frac{P(A_L,B_L|L)P(L)}{P(A_L,B_L|L)P(L)+P(A_L,B_L|D)P(D)}
$$ which seems not the same as solution 1 as far as I can tell. This solution makes me very uncomfortable about the meaning of $P(D)$ and $P(L)$ , are they the unknown probability of the cat is dead or alive if I have no witches words? Edit I found the solution 1 is the result of explaining the accuracy of prediction differently than solution 2. Explicitly, it explain $p_1=P(D|A_D)=P(L|A_L)$, which means, when $A$ says the cat is dead, the probability that the cat turn out to be dead is $p_1$; when $A$ says the cat is alive, the probability that the cat turn out to be alive is also $p_1$. Therefore, $$
P(L|A_L,B_L)=\frac{P(L|A_L,B_L)}{P(L|A_L,B_L)+ P(D|A_L,B_L)}= \frac{p_1p_2}{p_1p_2+(1-p_1)(1-p_2)}
$$ Edit2 As discussed, I think the most confusing part is how to properly define the accuracy of the witches, do you think there are ambiguities in the definition of this quantity? At least three candidates make some sense to me: $p_1=P(A_L|L)=P(A_D|D)$ This says: if the cat is alive, then the witch predict it as alive with probability $p_1$; if the cat is dead, then witch predict it as dead with probability $p_1$; $p_1 = P(L|A_L) = P(D|A_D)$ This says: if the witch says the cat is alive, then the probability that the cat turn out to be alive with probability $p_1$; same as when the witch says the cat is dead. $p_1 = P(A_L|L)P(L) + P(A_D|D)P(D)$ This says: the cat is either dead or alive, if it is alive, the witch predict it as alive; if it is dead, the witch predict it as dead; the sum of them should be the accuracy of the witch.

2055751,How to prove there are no solutions to the equation $a^2-4ab+b^2=0$ if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $b \neq 0$?,I am trying to prove $a^2-4ab+b^2=0$ has no solutions for all real numbers $a$ and $b$ and $b \neq 0$ My attempt: We know that $a^2 \geq 0$ and $b^2 > 0$ since $b \neq 0$. So then $a^2 + b^2 >0$. Now I'm stuck as I'm not sure how to show that $a^2 + b^2 = 4ab$ has no solutions given the above conditions. A little assistance would be greatly appreciated.,['algebra-precalculus']

2055910,Lipschitz continuous Gradient and bounded Hessian,"Is the following proposition true? Is there a simple proof? Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a twice continuously differentiable function. If there exists $M$ such that $||\nabla^2 f(x)||_2 \leq M$ for all $x$ then 
$$
\forall x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n: \quad ||\nabla f(x) - \nabla f(y)||_2 \leq M ||x - y||_2
$$ Update I believe I was able to prove it. Please tell me if I am wrong here, and where. First, we remember that any real symmetric matrix $H$ is diagonalizable $H = P^T \Lambda P$, and therefore:
$$
u^T H u = (P u)^T \Lambda (P u) \leq \lambda_H ||P u||^2 = \lambda_H ||u||^2
$$
where 
$$\lambda_H = \max_{i = 1, \dots, n} \{ |\lambda_1(H)|, \dots, |\lambda_n(H)| \}$$
Also, since $||H||_2^2 = \lambda_{max}(H^T H)$ and we know that $H^T H = P^T \Lambda^2 P$, then we also know that $||H||_2 = \lambda_H$ and therefore:
$$
u^T H u \leq ||H||_2 ||u||^2
$$ Now, using the multivariate first order Taylor approximation, we have:
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) - f(y) = \nabla f(y)^T (x - y) + 0.5 (y - z)^T \nabla^2 f(z) (y - z) \\
f(y) - f(x) = -\nabla f(x)^T (x - y) + 0.5 (x - w)^T \nabla^2 f(w) (x - w)
\end{aligned}
$$
where $z \in [x, y]$ and $w \in [x, y]$. Adding both equations, and re-arranging, we have:
$$
\begin{aligned}
(\nabla f(y) - \nabla f(x))^T(x - y) 
 &=  -0.5 (y - z)^T \nabla^2 f(z) (y - z) - 0.5 (x - w)^T \nabla^2 f(w) (x - w) \\
 &\geq -0.5 ||\nabla^2 f(z)||_2 ||y - z||^2 - 0.5 ||\nabla^2 f(w)||_2 ||x - w||^2 \\
 &\geq -0.5 M ||y - z||^2 - 0.5 M ||x - w||^2 \\
 &\geq -M ||x - y||^2
\end{aligned}
$$
Using Cauchy-Schwartz we also obtain
$$
- ||\nabla f(y) - \nabla f(x)|| \cdot ||y - x|| \geq (\nabla f(y) - \nabla f(x))^T(x - y) \geq -M ||x - y||^2
$$
Dividing both sides by $-||y - x||$ gives the desired result.","['lipschitz-functions', 'analysis']"
2055927,Is a map between Riemannian manifolds with bounded derivative Lipschitz?,"Let $X,Y$ be Riemannian manifolds. Let $f:X \to Y$ be an everywhere differentiable map, such that the operator norm $\|df_p\|_{op}$ is globally bounded (from above) by $L$. Is it true that $f$ is Lipchitz? (what about $L$-Lipschitzity?) I am interested in the general question in the case of low regularity , i.e I do not assume $f$ is $C^1$ (then it's quite easy ). In particular this means that for a smooth path $\alpha:I \to X$, we do not know a-priori that $f\circ \alpha$ is Lipschitz, so we cannot necessarily write its length as the integral of its speed. Note that in the case where $X,Y$ are Euclidean spaces, the answer is positive and is known as the ""mean value inequality"". However, the standard proof does not seem to pass over to the general case. Updated ""conjecture"": I guess $f$ does have to be Lipschitz, and even $L$-Lipschitz. First, since locally the Riemannian metric is ""close"" to Euclidean metric, I guess one could claim local-Lipschitzity certainly holds (admittedly, some details are probably required to justify this rigorously). Then, for any smooth path $\alpha$ in $X$, $f \circ \alpha$ will also be locally-Lipchitz and (compactness?) even Lipchitz. So we can express its length as the integral of its speed, so $f$ will be $L$-Lipschitz by the usual argument.","['derivatives', 'riemannian-geometry', 'lipschitz-functions', 'metric-spaces', 'differential-geometry']"

If $B$ is invertible, show that rank($AB$) = rank($A$). I've seen this question asked elsewhere but all had answers I didn't understand. I know how to solve the following problem If $A$ is invertible, then rank($AB$) = rank($B$) Because if $Bx=0$, then $ABx = A0 = 0$, and when $ABx=0$ then $Bx=0$ because $A$ is invertible, so null($AB$)=null($A$), and by the rank-nullity theorem, rank($A$) = rank($AB$). However when $B$ is invertible, as in the problem we have to tackle, I don't know how to use that fact. $ABx = 0$, but $B$ is in the middle so we can't simply get rid of it to get a meaningful expression.
