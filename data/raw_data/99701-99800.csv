1380768,Algorithm to answer existential questions - Reduction,"Lemma 1. For any $x$ in the ring $F[t,t^{-1}]$ ($F[t,t^{-1}]$: the polynomials in $t$ and $t^{-1}$ with coefficients in the field $F$), $x$ is a power of $t$ if and only if $x$ divides $1$ and $t-1$ divides $x-1$ (the divisibilities are meant, of course, in $F[t, t^{-1}]$). Lemma 2. $t^n-1$ divides $t^m-1$ in $F[t, t^{-1}]$ ($F[t,t^{-1}]$: the polynomials in $t$ and $t^{-1}$ with coefficients in the field $F$) if and only if $n$ divides $m$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. Lemma 3. Assume that the characteristic of $F$ is $p$ and $p>2$. 
  Then $(t^m-1)/(t^n-1)$ is a square in $F[t, t^{-1}]$ ($F[t,t^{-1}]$: the polynomials in $t$ and $t^{-1}$ with coefficients in the field $F$) if and only if $(\exists s \in \mathbb{Z}) m=np^s$. THEOREM. Assume that $F$ has characteristic $p>2$. Then the existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is undecidable. PROOF. We think of the powers of $t$ as representing the integers; thus, $t^n$ represents the integer $n$. By Lemma $1$, the set of powers of $t$ is existentially definable. Addition of integers $m+n$ corresponds to multiplication of the corresponding powers of $t$, $t^mt^n$. By Lemma $2$, the relation ""$n$ divides $m$"" (where $n$ and $m$ are given through their corresponding powers $t^n$ and $t^m$) is existentially definable. Moreover, the relation $(\exists s \in \mathbb{Z})m=p^sn$, by Lemma $3$, is also existentially definable. Therefore, if we had an algorithm to answer existential questions over $F[t, t^{-1}]$, we could convert it to an algorithm to answer existential questions in $\mathbb{Z}$ with the structure of addition, divisibility, and the relation $(\exists s \in \mathbb{Z})m=p^sn$. In an other paper it is shown that the last structure has undecidable positive existential theory (more accurately, one can define multiplication in a positive existential way in it, and therefore, the complexity of its positive existential theory is the same as the complexity of the positive existential theory of $\mathbb{Z}$ with addition and multiplication). It follows that the existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is undecidable. $$$$ How exactly do we conclude from the lemmas to the following? I haven't really understood it... Could you explain it to me? Therefore, if we had an algorithm to answer existential questions over $F[t, t^{-1}]$, we could convert it to an algorithm to answer existential questions in $\mathbb{Z}$ with the structure of addition, divisibility, and the relation $(\exists s \in \mathbb{Z})m=p^sn$. $$$$ EDIT1 : The language is $\{+,\cdot , 0,1,t\}$. I read again the proof and I undetstood the following: We suppose that the existential theory of $F[t,t^{-1}]$ is decidable, that means that there is an algorithm that answers existential questions over $F[t,t^{-1}]$. We want to reduce it to the existential theory of $\mathbb{Z}$ with the structure of addition, divisibility, and the relation $(\exists s\in\mathbb{Z})m=p^sn$, which is undecidable. To do so, we do the following: One part of the ""translation"" of the reduction is the mapping $t^n\mapsto n$. So, the set ""powers of t"" corresponds to ""integers"". So, we have to be able to ""filter out"" the powers of $t$ from all the other elements of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ in an existential way, according to Lemma $1$, permitted by the language. We have that $t^mt^n=t^{m+n}\mapsto m+n$ so $\mathbb{Z}$ has the structure of addition. By Lemma $2$ , $\mathbb{Z}$ has the structure of divisibility. And by Lemma $3$, $\mathbb{Z}$ has the structure of the relation $(\exists s\in \mathbb{Z})m=np^s$. Is that the idea of reduction? Have I understood it correctly? $$$$ EDIT2: I am reading again the proof and I got stuck at the following point: We say that by Lemma $2$, $\mathbb{Z}$ has the structure of divisibility. Do we conclude to that because this lemma can be written as an existential formula which is true in $F[t,t^{-1}]$ ? But the language does not consist of the divisibility. How is this existential formula? $$$$ EDIT3: Why doesn't the theorem stand also for $p=2$ ?","['proof-explanation', 'number-theory', 'logic', 'formal-languages', 'computability']"

In sedimentation involving mixtures of particles of various sizes, the larger particles hinder the movements of the smaller ones.

1380881,An alternative proof of Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem,"Let's focus on the following version of Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem: Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem : Let $f, g$ be functions defined on closed interval $[a, b]$ such that 1) Both $f, g$ are continuous on $[a, b]$ 2) Both $f, g$ are differentiable on $(a, b)$ 3) $g'$ does not vanish at any point in $(a, b)$ then there is a point $c \in (a, b)$ such that $$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}$$ In most good textbooks it is mentioned that this theorem can't be derived from the usual Mean Value Theorem. Using MVT we can get $$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)} = \frac{(f(b) - f(a))/(b - a)}{(g(b) - g(a))/(b - a)} = \frac{f'(c_{1})}{g'(c_{2})}$$ and we can't guarantee that $c_{1} = c_{2}$ and hence the above strategy to prove Cauchy's theorem fails. However I beg to differ and I provide the following argument. The geometrical interpretation of MVT is that if we take any two points on a continuous and smooth curve (with some further restrictions on nature of curve) then between this portion of the curve there is a point at which the tangent to the curve is parallel to the chord joining these two points . Cauchy's theorem is obtained at once if we use the parametric equation of the curve with $x = g(t), y = f(t), dy/dx = f'(t)/g'(t)$ for $t \in (a, b) $ and the endpoints of the curve are $(g(a), f(a)), (g(b), f(b))$. Hence Cauchy's Theorem is derivable from MVT. The rigorous proof proceeds as follows. Since $g'$ does not vanish it is clear from Rolle's theorem that $g$ is one one function so that $g(a) \neq g(b)$. If $g(a) < g(b)$ then we can show that $g$ is strictly increasing. Let $a \leq c < d \leq b$. Clearly $g(c) \neq g(d) \neq g(a)$. Let us suppose $g(d) < g(a)$ so that $g(d) < g(a) < g(b)$ and hence by IVT there will be a point $x$ in $(d, b)$ with $g(x) = g(a)$ contrary to the fact that $g$ is one one. So we must have $g(a) < g(d)$. Similarly $g(c) < g(b)$. Now suppose that $g(c) > g(d)$ so that $g(a) < g(d) < g(c)$ and by IVT there is an $x \in (a, c)$ with $g(x) = g(d)$ contrary to the fact that $f$ is one one. Hence $g(c) < g(d)$. We have thus shown that $g$ is strictly increasing. If $g(a) > g(b)$ then we can show in same manner that $g$ is strictly decreasing. Hence by inverse function theorem $h = g^{-1}$ exists and is continuous and differentiable. Suppose $g$ is increasing and let $A = g(a), B = g(b)$ so that $a = h(A), b = h(B)$ and consider the function $F(x) = f(h(x))$ on $[A, B]$. By MVT there is a $C \in (A, B)$ such that $$F(B) - F(A) = (B - A)F'(C)$$ or $$f(h(B)) - f(h(A)) = (g(b) - g(a))f'(h(C))h'(C)$$ If $h(C) = c$ then $c \in (a, b)$ and $h'(C) = 1/g'(c)$ and we get $$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}$$ I would like to get feedback on this proof above. I haven't found any issue with the argument and think it is perfectly valid.","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"

1380974,Probability of the card following first ace being ace of spades or two of clubs,"I am learning probability from Scheldon Ross' book . The question reads like this: A deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled, and the cards are turned up one at a time until the first ace appears. Is the next card – that is, the card following the first ace – more likely to be the ace of spades or the two of clubs? Solution given is: Each ordering of the 52 cards can be obtained by first ordering the 51 cards different from the ace of spades and then inserting the ace of spades into that ordering. Furthermore, for each of the 51! orderings of the other cards, there is only one place where the ace of spades can be placed so that it follows the first ace. Thus, $$P{(\text{the ace of spades follows the first ace})} = \frac{51!}{52!}=\frac{1}{52}$$ Similarly, the probability that the two of clubs (or any other card) follows the first ace is also $\frac{1}{52}$ . which sounds reasonable. However the author carefully notes the confusion usually made while solving this problem. I got his point, but somehow the explanation given to eliminate the confusion is still confusing me. The author notes below: Many people’s common reaction is to suppose initially that it is more likely that the two of clubs follows the first ace, since that first ace might itself be the ace of spades. This reaction is often followed by the realization that the two of clubs might itself appear before the first ace, thus negating its chance of immediately following the first ace. Upto this I got it, but did not get how the probability of first ace itself is ace of spade and probability that the two of clubs comes before the first ace are same, as author explains: However, as there is one chance in four that the ace of spades will be the first ace (because all 4 aces are equally likely to be first) and only one chance in five that the two of clubs will appear before the first ace (because each of the set of 5 cards consisting of the two of clubs and the 4 aces is equally likely to be the first of this set to appear), it again appears that the two of clubs is more likely. However, this is not the case as explained above. I did not get this: only one chance in five that the two of clubs will appear before the first ace (because each of the set of 5 cards consisting of the two of clubs and the 4 aces is equally likely to be the first of this set to appear) What I think is we have to prove: $$P(\text{first ace itself is an ace of spade}) = P(\text{two of clubs appear before first ace})$$ How authors' explanation proves this.

1381042,Dividing the whole into a minimal amount of parts to equally distribute it between different groups.,"Suppose we have a finite amount of numbers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ ($x_i\in\mathbb{N}$) and an object that should be divided into parts in such a way that it can be without further dividing distributed in $x_i$ equal piles for any $1\leq i\leq n$. The question is what is the minimal amount of parts for some $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ that would allow us to do that? Example: we have a cake and expect some friends, but we don't know for sure how many of them are coming. But somehow we know, that the total amount of people will be either 5 or 6 $(x_1 = 5, x_2 = 6)$. So we divide a cake beforehand into $5\times 6 = 30$ parts, and so in each scenario we can just give the guest his share of the cake. Optimization. Of course, 30 parts is too many. In the example above we could just divide the cake into 5 parts, then ignore it and divide the cake (like it was whole) into 6 parts. First we do 4 cuts, second we do 5 cuts; they don't coincide because 5 and 6 are coprimes. Total 9 cuts gives us 10 pieces. So instead of cutting the cake in 30 pieces, we can only cut it in 10. And that is the minimum here. Simple case. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be two coprime numbers. Then, using the same argumentation as above with the case $x_1=5, x_2=6$, we can note that the minimal amount of parts is $(x_1-1)+(x_2-1)+1$ which is equal to $x_1+x_2-1$. Generalization. First I thought that for $n$ coprime numbers the solution is simple and beautiful:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-1) + 1
$$
But this formula is wrong for $n>2$ as shows the following counterexample. Counterexample. For $x_1=3, x_2 = 4, x_3 = 5$ the formula gives the answer 10. But that's not the minimum, as we can divide at least in nine portions:
$$
\frac{1}{60} + \frac{2}{60} + \frac{4}{60} + \frac{5}{60} + \frac{7}{60} + \frac{8}{60} + \frac{10}{60} + \frac{11}{60} + \frac{12}{60} = 1
$$ 
so we can split it equally in 3 pieces:
$$
\left(\frac{1}{60} + \frac{2}{60} +  \frac{7}{60} + \frac{10}{60}\right) + \left(\frac{4}{60} + \frac{5}{60} +\frac{11}{60}\right) + \left(\frac{8}{60} + \frac{12}{60}\right) = 1
$$ 
in 4 pieces:
$$
\left(\frac{1}{60} + \frac{2}{60} +  \frac{12}{60}
\right) + \left(\frac{4}{60} +\frac{11}{60}\right) + \left(\frac{5}{60} + \frac{10}{60}\right) + \left(\frac{7}{60} + \frac{8}{60}\right) = 1
$$ 
in 5 pieces:
$$
\frac{12}{60}+\left(\frac{1}{60} +  \frac{11}{60}
\right) + \left(\frac{2}{60} +\frac{10}{60}\right) + \left(\frac{4}{60} + \frac{8}{60}\right) + \left(\frac{5}{60} + \frac{7}{60}\right) = 1

1381093,Curtains and groups,"This picture is a copy of the pattern on my curtains.  The points of a hexagonal lattice are each coloured with one of four possible colours.  It has translational symmetry in two directions: a vertical shift by four lines and a horizontal shift by six lines.  One generating patch is shown with a solid line. However if you change just three colours of the 24 in the generating patch, many more symmetries appear.  This picture shows the same pattern, except that the colours within the dotted line have been changed.  The new symmetries are: 180 degree rotational symmetry about any of the marked points and also a horizontal translation by three composed with the operation which switches dark blue for light blue and dark pink for light pink.  The latter symmetry can be applied twice to get the horizontal translation by six symmetry from before. If the person who designed this pattern didn't know about the extra symmetries, they might have just filled in the 24 colours in the generating patch at random and then translated it to produce the whole curtain.  The number of ways of doing this is $4^{24}$. However, they might have started by generating the full pattern.  If they had done that, I think they would have only had 6 choices (both the rotation and the translation by 3 should cut the number of choices in half).  If instead they had decided to start with the full pattern and then make up to three changes to it, they would have needed to make the 6 original choices, then choose three of 24 colours to change and the colours to change them to.  The number of ways of doing this is $4^6 \times \binom{24}{3} \times 4^3$. Thus, the probability that the first scenario (choosing 24 colours at random) would produce a pattern so close to the modified one is $\frac{4^6 \times \binom{24}{3} \times 4^3}{4^{24}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6}$.  This might suggest that they broke the full symmetry group intentionally to upset people like me.  However, I do not know how to calculate the chance that a randomly chosen generating 6 by 4 patch would be close to a pattern with some extra symmetries. My questions Suppose I generate a curtain pattern by choosing an $n$ by $m$ generating patch from $c$ possible colours.  This pattern automatically has symmetry group $\mathbb{Z}^2$.  What is the average number of colours I will have to change to get a larger group? (Or more precisely, if I want the group to be, say, twice as big, how many changes will I have to make on average?)  It's likely this depends on the underlying lattice (here, it's hexagonal) but I'm looking for techniques to answer this kind of question rather than numerical answers. The modified pattern has symmetry group generated by: $a$, the vertical translation by 4 $b$, the horizontal translation by 3 combined with the colour switching $c$, the rotation by 180 degrees about one of the marked points. It is $<a,b,c \mid c^2=e, cac=a^{-1}, cbc=b^{-1}>$, which is like two infinite dihedral groups combined together.  Does this group have a name? Why would the designer intentionally break such a nice symmetry group?","['tiling', 'group-theory', 'discrete-geometry']"

1381428,Symplectic group and Quaternion Inner product,"I have a problem understanding a passage from ""Naive Lie theory""(by John Stillwell), here is the passage from section $3.9$ ,page $71$: The idea of treating orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups uniformly
  as generalized isometry groups of the spaces $R^n$, $C^n$, and $H^n$ seems to
  be due to Chevalley [1946]. Before the appearance of Chevalley’s book,
  the symplectic group $Sp(n)$ was generally viewed as the group of unitary
  transformations of $C^{2n}$ that preserve the symplectic form: \begin{equation}
(\alpha_1 \bar\alpha'{_1}-\beta_1 \bar\beta'{_1})+ ...+(\alpha_n \bar\alpha'{_n}-\beta_n \bar\beta'{_n}) 
\end{equation} where $(α_1,β_1, . . . ,α_n,β_n)$ is the typical element of $C^{2n}$. This element corresponds to the element $(q_1, . . . ,q_n)$ of $H^n$, where: \begin{equation}
q_i=\begin{bmatrix}
    \alpha_i & -\beta_i  \\
    \bar\beta_i & \bar\alpha_i 
   \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation} The invariance of the quaternion inner product: \begin{equation}
q_1 \bar{q}'{_1}+...+q_n \bar{q}'{_n}
\end{equation}
  is therefore equivalent to the invariance of the matrix product: \begin{equation}
 \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
\alpha_1 & -\beta_1\\
\bar{\beta_1} & \bar{\alpha_1}\end{array} \right)\
 \left( \begin{array}{ccc}\
\bar{\alpha'_1} & \beta'_1\\
-\bar{\beta'_1} & \alpha'_1\end{array} \right)+...+
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
\alpha_n & -\beta_n\\
\bar{\beta_n} & \bar{\alpha_n}\end{array} \right)\
 \left( \begin{array}{ccc}\
\bar{\alpha'_n} & \beta'_n\\
-\bar{\beta'_n} & \alpha'_n\end{array} \right)
\end{equation} which turns out to be equivalent to the invariance of the symplectic form. My problem is that i couldn't see how the invariance of matrix product results in invariance of symplectic form mentioned by the author. I have checked the Chevalley book but i didn't find the specific symplectic form used by Stillwell.
Chevalley and other authors have used a symplectic form that doesn't include complex conjugate. This free complex conjugate symplectic form makes sense because it is the off-diagonal element of matrix product above, .i.e: \begin{equation}
(\alpha_1 \beta'{_1}-\beta_1 \alpha'{_1})+ ...+(\alpha_n \beta'{_n}-\beta_n \alpha'{_n}) 
\end{equation} Other authors also use symplectic form without complex conjugate, for example Modern Geometry Modern Geometric Structures and Fields But i don't know how to see the symplectic form defined by Stillwell is remained invariant.

1381464,Is there a closed-form approximation to a band-limited sawtooth?,"A partial Fourier Series with no coefficients is equal to the closed form expression: $${A \over n} \sum_{k=1}^n \cos(k\theta) = {A \over 2n} \left\{{\sin([2n + 1]\theta/2) \over \sin(\theta/2)} - 1\right\}$$ The sum of the harmonic series does not have a closed form expression, but can be approximated with the formula: $$H_n = \sum_{k=1}^n h_k = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac1k
= \ln n + \gamma 
+\frac1{2n} -\frac1{12n^2} + \frac1{120n^4} + ...
$$ This can be done with varying accuracy, depending on how many terms are used in the approximation. A band-limited sawtooth is a partial Fourier Series with harmonic coefficients.  Given that the two parts of its Fourier series have approximations to n terms, does a band-limited sawtooth also have an approximation to n terms? Observation #1 Related might be the harmonic generating function, which is: $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty z^k H_k = {-\ln(1 - z) \over 1 - z}$$ If expressed as a partial sum, it could be used in summation by parts. $$\sum_{k=1}^n h_k \cos(k\theta) = \sum_{k=1}^n h_k {1\over 2}(e^{ik\theta} + e^{-ik\theta}) = {1 \over 2} \sum_{k=1}^n h_k e^{ik\theta} + {1 \over 2} \sum_{k=1}^n h_k e^{-ik\theta}$$ $$\sum_{k=1}^n h_k e^{ik\theta} = H_n e^{in\theta} - \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} H_k e^{i(k+1)\theta} + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} H_k e^{ik\theta}$$ The latter two terms being the partial sums.  However, I can't find a partial sum of the generating function anywhere. Observation #2 Also related is the following: $$\sum_{k=1}^n H_k = (n + 1)H_n - n$$ Which could be used to further break up the problem through summation by parts: $$\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} H_k e^{ik\theta} = ( nH_{n-1} - n + 1)e^{i(n-1)\theta} - \sum_{j=1}^{n-2}((j + 1)H_j - j)e^{i(j+1)\theta} + \sum_{j=1}^{n-2}((j + 1)H_j - j)e^{ij\theta}$$ If I kept using summation by parts this way, I'd eventually get to a point where I could stop and ignore the new summations... right? If I were to stop here, I would get: $$nH_n\cos((n-1)\theta) - n\cos((n-1)\theta) + nH_n\cos(n\theta) - n\cos(n\theta) + H_n\cos(n\theta)$$ Or: $$(nH_n - n) * \left\{\cos([n-1]\theta) + \cos(n\theta)\right\} + H_n\cos(n\theta)$$ Graphing this does not give me a sawtooth wave, it gives me two sinusoids added together.  What this method seems to do is approximate the sawtooth with more partials each time I break up the summation, from N to 1, which has no benefit over just evaluating the Fourier Series. Observation #3 The Dirichlet Series is one way of expressing the sawtooth: $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty {a_k \over k^s}, a_k = cos(k\theta)$$ This doesn't seem to have a partial sum either. Observation #4 The Maclaurin Series for $\cos(\theta)$ is: $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty {(-1)^k \over (2k)!} \theta^{2k}$$ Each term of the Fourier Series could be represented as a Maclaurin Series. $$\sum_{k=1}^{n} h_k \cos(k\theta) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} h_k \sum_{j=0}^\infty {(-1)^j \over (2j)!} (k\theta)^{2j} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} {1 \over k} \sum_{j=0}^\infty {(-1)^j \over (2j)!} (k\theta)^{2j} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^\infty {(-1)^j \over (2j)! * k} (k\theta)^{2j}$$ But I'm not entirely sure where to go from there.

1381502,A combinatorial proof by tesselation of the plane.,"Some days ago the following problem was posed in the site: given a set of $N$ points in the plane such that for each pair of points $p,q$ we have $\lVert p-q\rVert >1$ , prove there is a subset of size at least $N/7$ such that every pair of points $p,q$ we have $\lVert p-q\rVert >\sqrt 3$ . My idea was to consider a tesselation of the plane by equilateral triangles of side $1$ . If one glues two of them by a common side we obtain a rhombus of great diagonal $\sqrt 3$ . One then may define a colouring of the set of $N$ points according to this tesselation (for example, coloring ${i,j}$ if they are in triangles that share a common side) and try to obtain a good anticlique using properties of the graph obtained. An observation is that if two points are apart at a distance $1$ or more then they are in different triangles, but two points can be in different triangles but be arbitrarily close. In the colouring defined before, one can see that if there is a $6$ -cycle $v_1\cdots v_6$ then for $w\in N(v_1)$ , say, we have $w\notin N(v_i)$ for $i\neq 1$ . I am trying to figure out if some finer tesselation (perhaps one should consider the three equilateral subtriangles in each big triangle) or colouring should be used. I insist that the proof should be in the lines of Ramsey theory, colouring and similar combinatorial ideas.","['combinatorics', 'tessellations']"

It is an open book test, where the internet and any other resources are fair game. Here's the question - I'm stuck on how to approach it and would appreciate pointers. My intuition is posted underneath. Background Your neighbor is a farmer with two cows, Clarabelle and Bernadette. Each cow has its own square pen that is 11m on a side (see first figure). The farmer is heading out of town for a trip and plans to leave the cows in their respective pens, which are completely filled with grass to start. The cows begin in the center of the pen, and will slowly move around the pen eating the grass. They move around the pen very slowly, always pausing to eat or rest after every step. If you divide the pen into 1m squares, the cows can move one square in any direction each step (like a king on a chess board), as shown in the second figure. Fig 1/2 After each move, the cow will spend 20 minutes in the new square eating grass, if it is available. Once the grass in a square is eaten, it is gone forever. If the cow moves to a square whose grass was already eaten, then the cow will spend 20 minutes resting in that square. After 20 minutes, whether resting or eating, the cow moves to another square. If a cow is in a square adjacent to the fence, she will never try to move in the direction of the fence. The cows never stay in the same square twice in a row -- they always move to a different one after resting or eating. The first figure shows an example of what a pen might look like after some hours, with the brown spots indicating squares that have been grazed. The first cow, Clarabelle, has no preference for direction when she moves. She is equally likely to move in any direction at all times. Let p be the probability that she moves in a direction, as shown in the first figure below. The second cow, Bernadette, prefers to move towards squares with grass. She is twice as likely to move towards a space that has grass as she is towards a space that she has already eaten, as shown in the second figure below. Fig 3/4 Questions If the farmer returns after 48 hours, what percentage of the grass in her pen do you expect Clarabelle to have eaten? How long do you expect it will take for Bernadette to eat 50% of the grass in her pen? Suppose that if either of the cows go 24 hours without eating any grass, she will die. Which cow is expected to survive longer? My intuition This appears to be modeling a random walk through a 2 dimensional grid. I can for instance figure out the probability of being at a particular node in the grid, after a given time. But I'm not sure how to think about the area covered by the cow as it walks through. Would appreciate any insights.","['probability', 'algorithms', 'random-walk']"
1381888,Set theory: $A-(B-C)=(A-B)\cup C$.,"I'm working through the set theory exercises in Apostol's Calculus Volume 1. I'm down to the last problem: Show that one of the following results is always correct and the other one is sometimes wrong. Then find a necessary and sufficient condition for the one that is sometimes wrong to always be correct. i) $A-(B-C)=(A-B)\cup C$ ii) $A-(B\cup C)=(A-B)-C$. So far I've worked out (by drawing some venn diagrams) that (i) is sometimes wrong and (ii) is always correct. I even found a counter-example to (i) so it's definitely sometimes wrong. I proved (ii) is always correct. The ""necessary and sufficient"" condition part is the one that I'm stuck on but I think I found the answer. Basically I've also worked out that if $C\underline{\subset} A$ then $x\in (A-B)\cup C\Rightarrow x\in A-(B-C)$. The motivation for $C\subseteq A$ is as follows: From the right side we see that if $x\in (A-B)\cup C$ then $x\in$ at least one of $(A-B)$ or $C$; now in the case that $x\in C$, we see that $x\not\in A-(B-C)$ unless $C\subseteq A$; this is because $B-C$ gets rid of all $C$ elements in $B$, so that $A-(B-C)$ doesn't get rid of any $C$ elements in $A$, SO ALL $C$'s in $A$ are still there; therefore, in order for $x\in C\Rightarrow x\in A-(B-C)$, we must have $C\subseteq A$, so I'm thinking that maybe $C\subseteq A$ is the condition we are looking for. The only problem now is proving that if $C\subseteq A$ then $x\in A-(B-C)\Rightarrow x\in (A-B)\cup C$ and this is proving difficult. I think my main problem is that I don't know how to manipulate $A-(B-C)$. I've reasoned as follows so far: If $x\in A-(B-C)$ then $x\in A$ and $\not\in (B-C)$. Then $x\in A$ and $\not\in$ the part of $B$ that isn't $C$. (I think saying it like this isn't rigorous enough, but correct if if I'm wrong.) Then there are two cases: $x\in A$ and $x\in B$, so then $x\in C$, since it cannot be in the part of $B$ that isn't $C$. This checks, because $C\subseteq A$. So one possibility is $x\in C$. On the other hand, we could also have $x\in A$ and $x\not\in B$, i.e. $x\in (A-B)$. Thus $x\in(A-B)\cup C$. I'm not sure how rigorous this is and would really like to know how someone experienced would write such a proof. It just seems to be hard to word and I'm having trouble going from step to step in set theory proofs in general due to the ""vagueness"" of such proofs. E.g.

  average of one sequence of events is the same as the ensemble average. Suppose that we have thrown a die one time in 10 consequent days and gotten these results: $\{5,5,1,5,4,1,2,3,5,5\}$ If we consider $(X_i)_{1\le i\le10}$ the random process for this experiment, in the $i$th day we have 6 possible values for random variable $X_i$ each with probablilty $\frac{1}{6}$ so:  $$ensemble\;average=\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6}=\frac{21}{6}=3.5$$
but for temporal average base on this single realization we have:$$temporal\;average=\frac{36}{10}=3.6$$

1382067,"Proof of the integral operator in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ being self-adjoint ""by hand""","Suppose we have an integral operator $A$ such that
$$Af(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}e^{-\frac{(x-y)^2}{2}}f(x) \, dy$$ This operator is bounded and $\|A\|=1$ (see Norm of the integral operator in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. ). So in order to prove $A$ to be self-adjoint it's suffice to show that it is symmetric, i.e.
$$\forall f,g\in L^2(\mathbb{R}):\,\, \langle Af, g \rangle = \langle f,Ag \rangle$$ We can prove it using unitary Fourier transform $F$ and its property that $\langle f,g \rangle = \langle Ff, Fg \rangle$ for any $f,g\in L^2(\mathbb{R})$: $$
\langle Af, g \rangle = \langle FAf, Fg \rangle 
= \langle \exp\left[-\frac{x^2}{2}\right](Ff), Fg \rangle = 
$$
$$
= \langle Ff, \exp\left[-\frac{x^2}{2}\right](Fg) \rangle 
= \langle Ff, FAg \rangle 
= \langle f, Ag \rangle
$$
So operator $A$ really is self-adjoint. The question is how one proves this fact without using Fourier transform? My attempts: $$\langle Af, g \rangle = \int\limits_\mathbb{R}\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}} e^{\frac{-(x-y)^2}{2}}f(y) \, dy \right)\overline{g(x)} \, dx.$$
Move the constant outside of the outer integral and the actor $\overline{g(x)}$ inside of the inner integral: $$\langle Af, g \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int\limits_\mathbb{R} \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}} e^{\frac{-(x-y)^2}{2}}f(y)\overline{g(x)} \,dy\,dx$$ It's to justify the following interchange of integrals: $$\langle Af, g \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int\limits_\mathbb{R} \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}} e^{\frac{-(x-y)^2}{2}}f(y)\overline{g(x)} \, dx\,dy$$
Move real-valued function and real constant under conjugation line and function $f(y)$ that doesn't depend on $x$ outside of the inner integral: $$\langle Af, g \rangle = \int\limits_\mathbb{R} f(y)\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}} \overline{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{-(x-y)^2}{2}}g(x)} \, dx\,dy$$
Do conjugation before integration: $$\langle Af, g \rangle = \int\limits_\mathbb{R} f(y)\left(\overline{\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{-(x-y)^2}{2}}g(x) \, dx}\right) \, dy = \langle f, Ag \rangle$$ So if we justify the interchange of integrals, the result will stand.","['integral-operators', 'operator-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

1382120,"$F[t]$ has undecidable positive existential theory in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$","Consider the ring $F[t, t^{-1}]$ (the polynomials in $t$ and $t^{-1}$ with coefficients in the field $F$). Theorem 1. Assume that the characteristic of $F$ is zero. Then the existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$ is unecidable. Theorem 2. Assume that $F$ has characteristic $p>2$. Then the existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is undecidable. We have that even the positive existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is undecidable. Now we give a Lemma that, together with the preceding results, allows us to conclude the undecidability of the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$. Lemma. If the characteristic of $F$ is other than $2$, then the solutions of $$X^2-(t^2-1)Y^2=1$$ with $X$ and $Y$ in $F[t]$ are given by $$(X, Y)=(\pm x_n, y_n)$$ where $$x_n+\sqrt{t^2-1}y_n=(t+\sqrt{t^2-1})^n$$ fr $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. Theorem 3. If the characteristic of $F$ is other than $2$, then $F[t]$ has undecidable positive existential theory in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$. Proof. Write $u=t+\sqrt{t^2-1}$. Then $u^{-1}=t-\sqrt{t^2-1}$ and $F[u, u^{-1}]=F[t, \sqrt{t^2-1}]$. We interpret the positive existential theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ in $F[t]$ in the following way: an element $x$ of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is represented as a pair $x=(a, b)$ with $a, b$ in $F[t]$ being the components of $x$ with repsect to the base $\{u, u^{-1}\}$ considering $F[u, u^{-1}]$ as a module over $F[t]$; addition and multiplication of elements of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is defined accordingly. So, we see that the positive existential theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is interpretable in $F[t]$ with only one problem: we do not have constants for $u$ and $u^{-1}$ but only for $\frac{u+u^{-1}}{2}=t$. So, the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ is undecidable provided that the theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is undecidable in the language $\{0, 1, u+u^{-1}/2, +, \cdot\}$. It is only a matter of routine checking to see that our undecidability result for $F[u, u^{-1}]$ holds true in this language as well: simply substitute $v=u-t$, write all equations involved in the form $fv=g$, where $f$ and $g$ have coefficients in $F[t]$ (the quantity $v^2$, wherever it appears, is replaced by $t^2-1$ which is in $F[t]$) and substitute the equations of this last form by the corresponding equations $f^2(t^2-1)=g^2$. Of course, it is necessary to check that the new solutions that come onto the scene through the squaring do not do any harm to the stated equivalences. Hence, the theorem follows. $$$$ How do we use the Lemma at the proof of Theorem $3$ ? How is it useful? $$$$ EDIT: That's how I understood the whole proof of Theorem $3$ : We know that the existential theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, u\}$ is undecidable. We want to reduce the positive existential theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, u\}$ to the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$ to show that this theory is also undecidable. To do that we do the following: We suppose that the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$ is decidable. We set $u=t+\sqrt{t^2-1}$. So, we have that $u^{-1}=t-\sqrt{t^2-1}$. So, we have $F[u, u^{-1}]=F[t, \sqrt{t^2-1}]$. So, $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is an extension of $F[t]$. Each element $x$ of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ can be written as followed: $x=a+b\sqrt{t^2-1}$, where $a,b \in F[t]$. So, the mapping of the reduction is $x \mapsto (a,b)$. $+ \ \ : \ \  $ $$x_1+x_2=a_1+b_1\sqrt{t^2-1}+a_2+b_2\sqrt{t^2-1}=(a_1+a_2)+(b_1+b_2)\sqrt{t^2-1} \mapsto (a_1+a_2, b_1+b_2)$$
$\cdot  \ \ : \ \  $ $$x_1\cdot x_2=(a_1+b_1\sqrt{t^2-1})(a_2+b_2\sqrt{t^2-1})=a_1 \cdot a_2+a_1 \cdot b_2 \sqrt{t^2-1}+a_2 \cdot b_1\sqrt{t^2-1}+b_1 \cdot b_2 (t^2-1)=(a_1 \cdot a_2+b_1 \cdot b_2 (t^2-1))+(a_1 \cdot b_2+a_2 \cdot b_1)\sqrt{t^2-1} \mapsto (a_1 \cdot a_2+b_1 \cdot b_2 (t^2-1), a_1 \cdot b_2+a_2 \cdot b_1)$$ 
$0  \ \ : \ \  $ $$0=0+0 \sqrt{t^2-1} \mapsto (0,0)$$ 
$1 \ \  :  \ \ $ $$1=1+0 \sqrt{t^2-1} \mapsto (1,0)$$ $u \ \ : \ \  $ $u \mapsto u-t=:v$. We write all the equations in the form $fv=g$ where $f,g \in F[t]$ and squaring these equations we get $f^2v^2=g^2 \Rightarrow f^2(t^2-1)=g^2$, so all these equations are in $F[t]$, where $t=(u+u^{-1})/2$. So we can convert the algorithm that answers to positive existential questions of $F[t]$ to an algorithm that answers to existential questions of $F[u, u^{-1}]$. Since the second theory is undecidable, we get aa contradiction. So the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ is undecidable. $$$$ Is this correct?","['logic', 'number-theory', 'formal-languages', 'computability']"

From a sample of $n$ individuals of a normal
population the mean and the standard deviation of
the population may be estimated by using two easily
calculated statistics. The best estimate of $m$ is $x$ where $$\overline{x} = \frac{1}{n} \, S(x),$$ while for the best estimate of sigma , we calculate s from
$$S^2= \left(\frac{1}{n-1}\right)(X-\overline{X})^2$$
these two statistics are calculated from the sums
of the first two powers of the observations (see
Appendix, p. 73), and are specially related to the
normal distribution, in that they summarise the whole
of the information which the sample provides as to
the distribution from which it was drawn, provided
the latter was normal. Fitting by sums of powers,
and especially by the particular system of statistics
known as moments, has also been widely applied to
skew (asymmetrical) distributions, and others which
are not normal. On the other hand, on page 73 he writes: A. Statistics derived from sums of powers.
If we have $n$ observations of a variate $x$, it is easy
to calculate for the sample the sums of the simpler
powers of the values observed, these we may write

s_2 &= S(X^2) \\
s_3 &= S(X^3) \\
s_4 &= S(X^4)
\end{align}
and so on. It is convenient arithmetically to calculate from
these the sums of powers of deviations from the mean
defined by the equations 
\begin{align}
S_2 &= s_2- \frac{1}{n} \cdot s_1^2 \\
S_3 &= s_3 - \frac{3}{n} \cdot s_2\cdot s_1 + \frac{2}{n^2} \cdot s_1^3 \\
S_4 &= s_4 - \frac{4}{n} \cdot s_3 \cdot s_1 + \frac{6}{n^2} \cdot s_2 \cdot s_1^2 - \frac{3}{n^3} \cdot s_1^4
\end{align} Many statistics in frequent use are derived from these
values.
(i) Moments about the arbitrary origin, $x = 0$;
these are derived simply by dividing the corresponding
sum by the number in the sample; in general if $p$ stand
for $p= I, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$, they are defined by the formula
$$m'p = \frac{1}{n} \cdot sp,$$ where  ($p$ is index). Clearly m'l is the arithmetic mean, usually written $\overline{x}$
(ii) In order to obtain values independent of the
arbitrary origin, and more closely related to the
intrinsic characteristics of the 'population sampled,
values called"" moments about the mean"" are widely
used, which are found by dividing the sums of powers
about the mean by the sample number; thus if
$p=2, 3, 4, \ldots$ $$mp= \frac{1}{n}\cdot S p$$
(again $p$ is the index) My question are: 
1) which is the intuition behind moment ( i searched on google but it was a bit complicated to get the point.) Pls try to explain the logic and not so many equations. 
2) Where are these equations coming from? 
\begin{align}
S_2 &= s_2 - \frac{1}{n}\cdot s_1^2 \\
S_3 &= s_3 - \frac{3}{n}\cdot s_2\cdot s_1 + \frac{2}{n^2}\cdot s_1^3 \\
S_4 &= s_4 - \frac{4}{n}\cdot s_3\cdot s_1 + \frac{6}{n^2}\cdot s_2 \cdot s_1^2 - \frac{3}{n^3}\cdot s_1^4 \text{ ?} 
\end{align}
3) Why in the case of normal distribution,  sums of first and second power they summarise the whole of the information which the sample provides as to
the distribution from which it was drawn, provided the latter was normal, and in other distributions you have to calculate greater power sums? Thanks in advance!","['statistics', 'moment-generating-functions']"
1382288,Finding $P$ such that $P^TAP$ is a diagonal matrix,"Let $$A = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 2&3 \\ 3&4  \end{array}\right) \in
M_2(\mathbb{C})$$ Find $P$ such that $P^TAP = D$ where $D$ is a diagonal matrix. So here's the solution: $$A = \left(\begin{array}{cc|cc} 2&3&1&0\\ 3&4&0&1    \end{array}\right) \sim \left(\begin{array}{cc|cc} 2&0&1&-3/2\\ 0&-1/2&0&1    \end{array}\right)$$ Therefore, $$P = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 1&-3/2\\ 0&1    \end{array}\right) \\ P^TAP = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 2&0\\ 0&-1/2    \end{array}\right) $$ What was done here exactly? I'd be glad elaborate about the process. Thanks.","['solution-verification', 'linear-algebra', 'diagonalization', 'matrices']"
