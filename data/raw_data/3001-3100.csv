21191,"Is the complex exponential function injective, surjective and/or bijective - and why?","I was just reading about the e -function in the complex plane and was trying to understand the differences between the real and the complex case.

21199,Is $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ not a ratio?,"In the book Thomas's Calculus (11th edition) it is mentioned (Section 3.8 pg 225) that the derivative $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ is not a ratio. Couldn't it be interpreted as a ratio, because according to the formula $\textrm{d}y = f'(x)\textrm{d}x$ we are able to plug in values for $\textrm{d}x$ and calculate a $\textrm{d}y$ (differential). Then if we rearrange we get $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ which could be seen as a ratio. I wonder if the author say this because $\mbox{d}x$ is an independent
variable, and $\textrm{d}y$ is a dependent variable, for $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ to be a ratio both variables need to be independent.. maybe?","['nonstandard-analysis', 'math-history', 'calculus', 'analysis']"

21243,Knowledge about Graph Spectral Theory and correlation between a graph Weighted Adjacency matrix and its eigenvalues,"I know that this question is some sort of bridge between Informatics and Mathematics, not knowing the best place where to post this question, I opted for this place because of the type of answer I want (which concerns Math more than anything). Consider to have a graph represented by a collection of nodes and connections. The best way to describe the graph is through the adjacency matrix (AM): a matrix that has 0 or 1 if one node is connected to another (we consider non-directed graphs, so we have all bidirectional connections). Does anyone know whether the eigenvalues of the matrix implies something for the graph??? properties, topology....
I ask this question because I've almost finished studying Markov Chains. In a chain, the matrix of transition probabilities P (for discrete time markov chains), or the matrix of transition frequencies Q (for cont-time markov chains), can be evaluated (their eigenvalues) in order to inspect whether the chain is ergodic or not (with a parallelism to Control Theory: eigenvalues in the unitary circle or in the negative half-plane).

21250,Pasting Together Fibers of a Vector Bundle,"Everyone:
  Please forgive that I do not yet know LaTex, bro, and my English ( I am from UCV in Venezuela). I think I understand  concept of bundles almost well, and that, once a vector bundle with a fiber is known/given, that we can define a new fiber pointwise, in manipulating each of the fibers, e.g., we may change the fiber from being R (over itself) to being R(+)R, or from R to R(x)R ; RxR*, (dual)etc.
    What I  not too clear on, is on how one put together all the new fibers coherently into a bundle, i.e., how one construct new trivializations and transition functions to turn the space with altered fiber into a new bundle. I am particularly interest in the quotient bundle, if someone  knows. I imagine we use initial charts, trivialization to construct the altered bundle, but I don't see fully how, other than I pretty sure we use multilinear algebra and functoriality somehow.   Would be great if someone knew about how to do this for general fiber bundles. Thanks You from Caracas.","['general-topology', 'linear-algebra', 'vector-bundles']"

21257,On Some Properties of Hölder Continuous Functions,"The function space $H^{\alpha} (\Omega)$ for $0 < \alpha \le 1$,  is the set of functions: $$\{ f \in C^0(\Omega) : \sup_{x \neq y} \dfrac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x-y|^{\alpha}} < \infty \}$$ with the metric $d_{H^{\alpha}} = || f - g ||_{H^{\alpha}}$, where 
$$||f||_{H^{\alpha}} = ||f||_{sup} + [f]_{H^{\alpha}} \text{ ,        } [f]_{H^{\alpha}} = \sup_{x \neq y}  \dfrac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x-y|^{\alpha}} $$ Now, if $0 < \alpha < \beta \le 1$, then $$[f]_{H^{\alpha}} \le 2 ||f||_{sup}^{1-\frac{\alpha}{\beta}}  [f]_{H^{\beta}}^{\frac{\alpha}{\beta}} \space \forall f \in H^{\beta}$$ And also, there is some constant $M$ so that: $$||f||_{H^{\alpha}} \le M ||f||_{sup}^{1-\frac{\alpha}{\beta}}  ||f||_{H^{\beta}}^{\frac{\alpha}{\beta}} \space \forall f \in H^{\beta}$$ These were some questions on a problem set: I have checked that $d_{H^{\alpha}}$ is a metric, and proved the two properties (in the second I found that $M = 2$ is sufficient). However, rather blindly. It's easy to show from the first that if $0 < \alpha < \beta \le 1$, then $H^{\beta} \subset H^{\alpha}$. What else do these formulas mean? Are they just some useful inequalities, or do they establish some connection between $H^{\beta}$ and $H^{\alpha}$? Thanks.","['holder-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
21263,Sufficient conditions on subsequences for convergence of a sequence,"Given a sequence $a_n$, I know that if I can find a divergent subsequence of $a_n$, or two subsequences of $a_n$ that converge to different values, $a_n$ diverges, since, if I have understood correctly, a sequence $a_n$ converges to a limit $L$ if and only if every subsequence of $a_n$ converges to that value $L$. I've been wondering if this last condition was equivalent to showing that some subsequences converge to $L$, picking the subsequences such that every element of the original sequence is in at least one of the subsequences. Is it? I would guess that the terms ""partition"" or ""covering"" fit this description. Thanks.","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"
21292,Morphisms of finite type are stable under base change,"I am trying to prove that morphisms of finite type are stable under base change, but I am having some trouble moving from the case where everything is affine to the general case.  Suppose $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is a morphism of finite type and $Y'$ is a $Y$-scheme.  I want to show that the morphism $g: X \times_Y Y' \rightarrow Y'$ is of finite type.  In the case that $X$, $Y$, and $Y'$ are affine, I understand why this is true.  For the general case, by a lemma in Liu's book, it is enough to show that there is an affine open cover $\{V_i\}_i$ of $Y'$ such that for each $i$, $g^{-1}(V_i)$ is a finite union of affine open subsets $U_{ij}$ such that for each $i$ and $j$, $O_X(U_{ij})$ is a finitely generated algebra over $O_Y(V_i)$. Here is my attempt at proving this. Choose an affine open cover $\{V_i\}_i$ of $Y'$.  Is it true that $g^{-1}(V_i)=X \times_Y V_i$?  I think this should follow from how we constructed the fibered product by gluing.  Since $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is of finite type, we may choose an affine open cover $\{Y_j\}$ of $Y$ such that $f^{-1}(Y_j)$ is covered by a finite number of affine opens $W_{jk}$.  Now, $W_{jk} \times_Y V_i$ are open subschemes that cover $X \times_Y V_i$, but since $Y$ is not necessarily affine, these schemes are not necessarily affine, right?  Furthermore, if we are using the $W_{jk}$ to cover all of $X$, there could be infinitely many of them.  To make the $W_{jk} \times_Y V_i$ affine, we could further cover them with $W_{jk} \times_{Y_k} V_i$, but we are not guaranteed finitely many $Y_k$ either, so while these schemes will be affine, there will not necessarily be finitely many.  I have been having some trouble with these sorts of arguments where one can immediately reduce to the affine case, and some help here would be greatly appreciated.",['algebraic-geometry']

Proving the convergence of this series is trivial but finding the value to which converges has defied me so far. Mathematica says this series converges to $\approx 1.29129$. I tried Googling about this series and found very little information about this series (which is actually surprising since the series looks cool enough to arise in some context). We were joking that it should have something to do with $\pi,e,\phi,\gamma$ or at the least it must be a transcendental number :-). My questions are: What does this series converge to? Does this series arise in any context and are there interesting trivia to be known about this series?

21380,Proving that there exists a unique f(x) given Area and arc-length of f(x) on a given interval,"I've been suggested to this site by some nice people at mathoverflow.net Before I get started, let me tell you a little about myself. I’m a fourth year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Michigan, Dearborn Campus. This said, I am not a mathematician, however I do know a bit about math, and I also enjoy doing math. Please excuse any redundancies I may make and my “lack of rigor”. The problem I’m working on now is an interesting one, and it goes as follows: Suppose we have some unknown function of some real variable x, namely f(x), which is “well-behaved” on some known, finite interval, {a,b}. What is meant by “well-behaved” is that it is at least once differentiable, once integrate-able, smooth, and continuous on {a,b}. Suppose further that we are given some finite area-under-the-curve A, and some finite arc-length S. Suppose finally that we are given f(x=a) and f(x=b). The problem is this: Given the above restraints on f(x), prove that there always exists some unique function f(x) that “fits the bill”. For example: Say f(x) = Sin(x), a = pi/2, and b = pi. We know that: f(a) = 1, f(b) = 0, A = 1, S = Sqrt[2]*EllipticE[1/2] ≈ 1.9101. The problem in this case would be to prove that f(x) = Sin(x) is the only function that has the known area A, and known arc-length S. Side Note: f(x) in this case could also be Cos(x - pi/2), however, this would not constitute two unique functions, f(x). A corollary question could be posed if a proof to the first problem was given, and is as follows: Given the same criterion for f(x) as before, devise a method of determining what f(x) would have to be to “fit the bill”. That is, like in our previous example, given: A = 1, S = 1.9101; devise a method of determining that f(x) must equal Sin(x). Another Side Note: I have realized (with help from mathoverflow.net) that f(x)=(x-1)^2(x+1) and f(-x) have the same Area and arc-length on [-1,1]. Making a potentially erroneous proposition, let us say that for all polynomials of nth order P(x), P(-x) will have the same Area and arc-length on any [-c,c]. This would prove difficult to prove analytically due to the ""ugly"" expression for arc-length. While in general f(x) and f(-x) are unique functions, there must be some way of thinking about them as similar enough to ""lump"" them into one unique function... Just a thought Thank you all. I look forward to any insight you can shed on the problem.","['calculus', 'integration']"

21490,"For a polygon on complex plane, when are the vertex 'Fourier coefficients' non-zero","Consider an $n$-sided convex polygon $P$ that contains the origin in the complex plane. Let the $j$-th vertex be denoted $z_j = r_j e^{i\theta_j}$ ($0 \leq \theta_j < 2 \pi$) for $j= 1 \dots n$. I'm interested in non-zero values of $$ a_k(P)= \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{z_{j}^{k}}{|z_{j}|^{k-1}}=\sum_{j=1}^{n} r_j e^{ik\theta_j} \textrm{ for } k \geq 1.$$ Lemma: Given a integer $m \geq 2$, if, for every $k \geq 1$ where $m$ does not divide $k$, $a_k(P)=0$, then the polygon $P$ is $m$-fold rotationally symmetric, that is, a rotation of $e^{i\frac{2 \pi}{m}}$ rotates the polygon into itself. Pseudo-Proof: Re-imagine the $n$-sided polygon $P$ as a $2 \pi$-periodic function $f(\theta)$ of the angle $\theta$ where each vertex $z_j$ is represented as a Dirac delta function at $\theta_j$ with integral $r_j$, that is,
$$f(\theta)=\sum_{j=1}^{n} r_j \delta (\theta - \theta_j).$$ The calculation $a_k(P)$ is then just $2 \pi$ times the $k$-th Fourier coefficient for $f(\theta)$. If, for all $k$ where $m$ does not divide $k$, $a_k(P)=0$, then the corresponding Fourier coefficients of $f(\theta)$ are all zero, implying that $f(\theta)$ is $\frac{2 \pi}{m}$-periodic. Hence the polygon will be $m$-fold rotationally symmetric. $\square$ Firstly, is there a good way to prove this lemma without resorting to non-converging Fourier series? Then, in the same vein, the lemma implies that, if $P$ is not rotationally symmetric, then for every $m$, there are values of $k$, that are not multiples of $m$ for which $a_k(P) \neq 0$. But I believe much more is true, namely, that for 'almost' all $k$, $a_k(P) \neq 0$. In particular, if $k$ is the smallest so that $a_k(P) \neq 0$, I'd like to show that there is a $k'$ relatively prime to $k$ so that $a_{k'}(P) \neq 0$, but I'm not sure how to approach the issue.

Ideally, wouldn’t the determinant be defined in the following manner: “Given a matrix $A$ , let $\det A$ be an element of $\mathbb{F}$ such that $x$ , $y$ and $z$ .” Then one would proceed to prove that this element is unique, and derive the familiar formulae.

21851,"Connecting a $n, n$ point grid","I stumbled across the problem of connecting the points on a $n, n$ grid with a minimal amount of straight lines without lifting the pen. For $n=1, n=2$ it is trivial. For $n=3$ you can find the solution with a bit trial and error (I will leave this to the reader as it is a fun to do, you can do it with 4 lines). I found one possible solution for a $4,4$ grid and animated it, it uses 6 lines and is probably optimal (will hopefully help you to understand the problem better, the path doesn't have to be closed like in the animation, open ends are allowed!): Now my question is, for higher $n$ , is there a way to get the amount of minimal lines to use and does an algorithm exist to find a actual solution? I think its quite hard to model the ""straight lines"" with graph theory. Edit:
Reading Erics excellent answer I found the following website: http://www.mathpuzzle.com/dots.html that also gives an algorithm to connect the points in $2n-2$ steps, solutions up to $10,10$ and mentions: Toshi Kato conjectures: On $(2N+1)x(2N+1)$ grid, $N \geq 2$ , Using $4N$ continuous lines, and not lifting your
pencil from the paper, can go through
all the dots of a $(2N+1)x(2N+1)$ grid,

must visit at least one dot twice in
the route. On $(2N)x(2N)$ grid, $N \geq 2$ , Using $4N-2$ continuous lines, and not lifting your

all the dots of a $(2N)x(2N)$ grid,
ending at the same place started. And
can visit each dots just once. It seems to be an open problem to show that $2n-2$ is optimal. Also I found the following page with a proof that in the $3,3$ grid there cannot be $2$ parallel lines: http://fahim-patel.blogspot.com/2011/01/proof.html I think it might be interesting for coming up with a proof that $2n-2$ is optimal (however maybe there is no such proof, as we only saw solutions for very small $n$ , for bigger $n$ there might be some developments we don't know about).","['geometry', 'puzzle', 'graph-theory']"
21852,Techniques to compute complex integrals over infinite contours,"In asymptotic analysis and analytic number theory, one often has to deal with complex integrals over infinite contours in the complex plane, and the required techniques to do so often go beyond the standard courses of complex analysis in one variable. In particular, I am interested in the following type of argument which I don´t fully understand and which I will try to illustrate by an example (taken from Paris and Kaminski, ""Asymptotics and Mellin-Barnes Integrals""): Consider the so called Cahen-Mellin integral
$$e^{-z}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{(c)}\Gamma(s)z^{-s}ds,\ \arg(z)<\frac{\pi}{2}, z\neq 0,$$
which is an integral representation of the exponential function by taking the inverse Mellin transform of the Gamma function, where the integration contour $(c)$ stands for the vertical line $\{\Re(s)=c\}$ with some $c>0$. It can be shown that the integrand has ""the controlling behavior"" $|z|^{-\sigma}O(|t|^{\sigma-{1\over 2}}e^{t\arg(z)-{1\over 2}\pi|t|})$ as $|t|\to\infty$, where $s=\sigma + it$. Now, aside from the obvious way to show the validity of the above integral representation, Paris and Kaminski argue that because of the aforementioned exponential decay of the integrand we are allowed to move the contour of integration over the poles of the Gamma function and use the residues of the latter to obtain the exponential series. This is precisely the argument I want to understand, so I will try to break it down into few smaller questions: (Q1) How does the exponential decay of the integrand allow us to displace the contour of intagration over singularities? Is there a more general setup where the asymptotic behavior of the integrand allows for moving the contour of integration through and over singularities? (Q2) After the displacement of the integration contour (still a vertical line), what kind of a residue theorem allows for considering all of the infinitely many singularities of the gamma function? The version of the residue theorem I know uses bounded interior of a (simply) closed contour in the complex plane and only finitely many residues contained in there. Remark 1: In order to compute the above integral in a classical way, I would take a finite line segments of the vertical line, symmetric with respect to the positive real axis, i.e. $\{Re(s)=c, -r_n\leq\Im(s)\leq r_n\}$, construct circle segments with radii $r_n$ encompassing each of the poles, with $r_n\uparrow \infty$ suitably chosen such that no poles lie on the segment contours, and then show that the integrals over the half-circles tend to zero as $n\to\infty$, thus obtaining on the one hand the integral over the infinite vertical line and on the other hand the infinite sum of the residues. However, I haven´t really checked whether the exponential decay of the integrand would suffice for the half-circle integrals to vanish in the limit. Remark 2: I could imagine that there might be a version of the residue theorem suitably formulated for the Riemann sphere resp. $\bar{\mathbb{C}}:=\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}$, where basically infinite contours from the complex plane correspond to closed ones on the sphere. (Q3) Where could one find a more systematic treatment of integrals over infinite contours in the complex plane, including contour shifting over poles, other types of contour modifications, usage of infinitely many residues, as well as other techniques for the exact computation of such integrals? I understand that such techniques are often to be applied ""individually"", thus such literature would ideally contain a few good examples. Thanks in advance for your attention and sorry if I appear to sound too confused :-), I am only trying to fill in certain ""gaps"" in my knowledge of complex analysis. PS: I am not interested in numerical computations or general asymptotic expansions for contour integrals (even though in the above example the residues ""expansion"" appears as a special case thereof).","['reference-request', 'complex-analysis']"

where $q = e^{\pi i \tau}$ (or $e^{2 \pi i \tau}$ depending on which text you consult) and $r_{2,n}(k)$ is the number of ways to represent $k$ as a sum of $n$ squares, i.e. , the integral solutions of the equation $k = x_{1}^{2} + \dots + x_{n}^{2}$.

This is already monic, so to show that this is a minimal polynomial I only need to show that it is irreducible. Edit: To do that, I can use the Eisenstein: $p=2$ does not divide $a_1 = 1$ and $p^2$ does not divide $a_0 = -2$, therefore it is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. (ii): This time, $\sqrt[4]{2}i$ is a root of $f(x) = x^2+\sqrt{2}$. For polynomials of degree two it's enough to check if they have a root.
