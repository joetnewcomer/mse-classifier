183476,Rounding of complementary percentages [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Rounding Percentages (1 answer) Closed 8 years ago . This problem arose while tallying votes in a poll and displaying the results as a whole number percentage. So if ""Option A"" received $300$ votes and ""Option B"" received $100$, the display should read ""$75\%$, $25\%$"". There is a requirement that the integer percentages must add up to $100\%$. Which means that rounding up one percentage will cause the other to round down. How should the following percentages be rounded? $20.5\%$ & $79.5\%$ (which one rounds up?) $49.5\%$ & $50.5\%$ (equal or not?) $0.5\%$ & $99.5\%$ (is $0.5\%$ statistically significant?) I tend to feel that the small numbers should be given more priority (so $0.5\%$ rounds up to $1$, while the $1\%$ difference in the $49.5$/$50.5$ split gets increased to $2\%$ giving $49$/$51$). Is there any ""one rule to round them all""?",['statistics']
183483,Rating system incorporating experience,"I am looking to rank players on something and right now I am using a win-loss percentage to ""rank"" the players. The issue is that I have some people who just beat out the 5 game threshold and have a win/loss ratio of say 5 wins, 1 loss for 83% and then I have someone who has 54 wins and 10 losses for ~82%. I want to ""rank"" the more experienced player higher than the other, but I have no idea how to include ""experience"" as part of the formula. I know there are many many ways this can be done, I am just interested in a few of the most simplistic accurate and common approaches and perhaps links to rating theory discussion when only knowing the wins and losses.",['statistics']
184157,What type of object is a differential form?,"This is a naive question; apologies in advance.
For a point $p \in M$ on a smooth manifold $M$, a differential form can be viewed as
a map
$$T_p M\times \cdots \times T_p M \to \mathbb{R} \;.$$
What puzzles me about this object is that it is not ""differential.""
Yes, I know, the tangent space $T_p M$ is differential in that it is tangent .
But if $M=\mathbb{R}^n$, then I lose the intuitive sense of tangency, and just
end up with a map from $k$ vectors to $\mathbb{R}$ with certain properties
(the map is multilinear, and alternating). I seek a way to view differential forms intuitively that somehow emphasizes their differential aspects.  Help would be much appreciated---Thanks!",['differential-geometry']

184211,"Rainwater theorem, convergence of nets, initial topology","I've stumbled upon a result called Rainwater's theorem a few times, it seems to be a very useful result in connection with weak convergence in Banach spaces. Rainwater's theorem. Let $X$ be a Banach space, let $\{x_n\}$ be a bounded sequence in $X$ and $x \in X$. If $f(x_n)\to f(x)$ for every $f\in\operatorname{Ext}(B_{X^*})$, then $x_n \overset{w}\to x$. The symbol $x_n \overset{w}\to x$ denotes the convergence in weak topology . 
By $B_{X^*}$ we denote the unit ball of the dual $X^*$ (with respect to the usual operator norm ) and $\operatorname{Ext}(B_{X^*})$ is the set of all extreme points of this set. See e.g. Corollary 3.137, p.140 in Banach Space Theory: The Basis for Linear and Nonlinear Analysis by Marián Fabian, Petr Habala, Petr Hájek, Vicente Montesinos, Václav Zizler. In particular, if we apply the above to the space $C(K)$, where $K$ is compact, we get the following result (Corollary 3.138) in the same book. Corollary. Let $K$ be a compact topological space. Let $\{f_n\}$ be a bounded
  sequence in $C(K)$ and $f\in C(K)$. Then, if $f_n\to f$ pointwise, we have $f_n \overset{w}\to f$. Weak convergence of a sequence in $X$ means, by definition, that $f(x_n)\to f(x)$ for each $f\in X^*$. Rainwater's theorem essentially says that there is a smaller set of functionals we need to check - namely the set $\operatorname{Ext}(B_{X^*})$. It is quite natural to ask whether the same is true for nets. Let $(x_\sigma)_{\sigma\in\Sigma}$ be a net in a Banach space $X$ and let $x\in X$. Is it true that $x_\sigma \overset{w}\to x$ if and only if $f(x_\sigma)\to f(x)$ for every $f\in\operatorname{Ext}(B_{X^*})$? The weak topology is precisely the initial topology on $X$ w.r.t. all linear continuous functionals. Again, it is natural to ask whether we can replace $X^*$ by a smaller set. In this way we get a reformulation of the above question. Is the weak topology on $X$ the initial topology w.r.t. $\operatorname{Ext}(B_{X^*})$? If the answer to the above questions is negative, I would like to know whether they hold at least for $C(K)$. If $(f_\sigma)_{\sigma\in\Sigma}$ is a net in $C(K)$ and let $f\in C(K)$. Is it true that $f_\sigma$ converges to $f$ weakly if and only if it converges pointwise? Is the weak topology on $C(K)$ the same as the initial topology w.r.t. the maps $f\mapsto f(x)$ for $x\in K$ (i.e. the evaluations at all points of $K$)?","['examples-counterexamples', 'locally-convex-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"
184212,When do all derivations come from automorphisms?,"Let $k$ be a field (algebraically closed for simplicity) and let $A$ be an $n$-dimensional algebra over $k$ (not necessarily commutative or even associative). The group $G=\mbox{Aut}(A)$ is an algebraic group. The elements of the lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ act (naturally) on $A$ and they act as derivations over $k$. So we have the inclusion $\mathfrak{g}\subseteq \mbox{Der}_k(A)$. My first questions: Can this inclusion be strict? If so, how can $\mathfrak{g}$ be characterized within $\mbox{Der}_k(A)$? is it an Ideal (in the lie algebra sense)? Are there reasonable conditions on $A$ that ensure equality? Now, for a more specialized setting, in Serre's book ""Lie algebras and Lie groups"" there is a proof of the theorem that if $\mathfrak{s}$ is a semi-simple real lie algebra with a definite killing form then it is a Lie algebra of some compact real Lie group $G$ (Thm 6.3). The group $G$ is taken to be $\mbox{Aut}(\mathfrak{s})$ and it is stated without explanation that ""The Lie algebra of $\mbox{Aut}(\mathfrak{s})$ is the algebra of derivations of $\mathfrak{s}$"" (which then equals $\mathfrak{s}$ itself since $\mathfrak{s}$ is semi-simple), so the more specialized question is Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra, under what conditions the lie algebra of $\mbox{Aut}(\mathfrak{g})$ is the whole $\mbox{Der}_k(\mathfrak{g})$?","['algebraic-groups', 'lie-algebras', 'abstract-algebra']"
184213,Irreducibility of an Affine Variety and its Projective Closure,"Volume I of Shaferevich's Basic Algebraic Geometry has the following as an exercise: Show that the affine variety $U$ is irreducible if and only if its closure $\bar U$ in a projective space is irreducible. Unfortunately, he doesn't explicitly give a definition of irreducibility for quasiprojective varieties.  Based on the definition for (closed) sets in affine space, I assumed that a quasiprojective variety $X$ is reducible if there are closed sets $Z_1, Z_2$ such that neither contains $X$ and such that 
$$\left ( Z_1 \cap X \right ) \cup \left ( Z_2 \cap X \right ) = X$$
 (i.e. $X$ can be written as a nontrivial union of sets that are closed with respect to $X$). I found a pretty easy proof that $U$ is reducible iff $\bar U$ is, which gives the proposition.  However, I'm suspicious because it doesn't rely at all on the fact that $U$ is an affine variety, or even a quasiprojective variety at all (in the sense that if you defined irreducibility for arbitrary subsets of projective space, it would still work). One reason for this could be that a quasiprojective variety is irreducible iff its projective closure is, and the point of the exercise is to notice this, and that the definitions of irreducibility for affine varieties and for affine closed sets agree. The other could be that my solution doesn't work, or that I have the wrong definition. I'm asking which is the case. My proof is as follows: First assume that $U$ is reducible. The we have closed sets $Z_1$, $Z_2$, neither of which contain $U$, such that $ \left ( Z_1 \cap U \right ) \cup \left (Z_2 \cap U \right ) = U$.  As $Z_1 \cup Z_2 \supseteq U$ is closed, we have $Z_1 \cup Z_2 \supseteq \bar U$.  But then neither of the $Z_i$ contain $\bar U$, since $\bar U \supseteq U$, and since $Z_1 \cup Z_2$ is a closed set containing $U$, $Z_1 \cup Z_2$ contains $\bar U$ and $\left ( Z_1 \cap \bar U \right ) \cup \left ( Z_2 \cap \bar U \right ) = \bar U$ so that $\bar U $ is reducible.  The proof for the other direction is almost identical.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-geometry']"

184222,"Evaluate the determinant $\det\left[ \binom{2n}{n+i-j} \right]_{i,j=0}^{n-1}$","I am trying to show that:
\begin{equation}
\det\left[ \binom{2n}{n+i-j} \right]_{i,j=0}^{n-1}=\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{\binom{2n+i}{n}}{\binom{n+i}{n}}
\end{equation} I have tried playing with the algebra for some time. For example, if we fix $i$ and consider a particular row vector, we have:
\begin{equation}
\left[ \begin{array}{c} 
\binom{2n}{n+i} & \binom{2n}{n+i-1} & \binom{2n}{n+i-2} & \dots & \binom{2n}{i+1} 
\end{array}
\right] 
\end{equation}
Which equals
\begin{equation}
\left[ \begin{array}{c} 
\frac{(2n)!}{(n+i)!(n-i)!} & \frac{(2n)!}{(n+i-1)!(n-i+1)!} & \frac{(2n)!}{(n+i-2)!(n-i+2)!} & \dots & \frac{(2n)!}{(i+1)!(2n-i-1)!} 
\end{array}
\right] 
\end{equation}
It seems that our goal should be to factor out $\binom{2n+i}{n} / \binom{n+i}{n}$ and leave a matrix whose determinant evaluates to 1. Clearly:
\begin{equation}
\binom{2n+i}{n} / \binom{n+i}{n} = \frac{(2n+i)!}{n!(n+i)!} \cdot \frac{n!(i!)}{(n+i)!} =  \frac{(2n+i)!}{(n+i)!} \cdot \frac{i!}{(n+i)!}
\end{equation}
However, I am unsure of how to proceed. For those interested, the determinant given enumerates plane partitions contained within an $n\times n \times n$ cube, or equivalently, rhombic tilings of a regular hexagon with side length $n$.","['linear-algebra', 'determinant', 'combinatorics']"

184276,"If $(f'_n)$ converges uniformly, does $(f_n)$ necessarily converge uniformly?","I've been studying complex analysis problems, and get stuck on the following: Let $D \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be a domain (open connected set) and $z_0 \in D$. Assume that $(f_n)$ is a sequence of analytic functions in $D$ such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(z_0) = w_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ and that sequence of derivatives $(f'_n)$ converges uniformly on compact subsets of $D$ to a function $g$. 
Is it true that there exists an analytic function $f$ in $D$ such that $f_n \to f$ uniformly on compact subsets of $D$? Prove or give a counterexample. I don't even know if this is true. I thought I had a solution (see below) but I realized that I was using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus on sets which were not necessarily simply connected, which is invalid. However, I have been unsuccessful in finding a counterexample either. Does anyone know a way to fix the hole in my reasoning, or a counterexample if the statement is false?  Thanks. Suppose $K$ is connected compact subset of $D$ which contains $z_0$ with Lebesgue number $\delta$. Then there exists of an open cover of $K$ by some number $k$ of $\delta$-disks. For each $m$ there exists  $M>0$ such that $|f'_n(z)-g(z)| < 1/m$ and $|f_n(z_0) - w_0| < 1/m$ for all $n > M$ and all $z \in K$. 
Now let $z \in K$, and let $\gamma$ be a path of minimal length from $z_0$ to $z$ inside the $\delta$-cover of $D$. Then for $n > M$, 
$$\left | \int_\gamma f'_n(t) - g(t) dt\right| \leq  \ell (\gamma) /m \leq 2\delta k /m. $$
Then 
\begin{align*} \left| f_n(z) - \left(w_0 + \int_\gamma g(t) dt\right ) \right | &= \left| \left(f_n(z)- f_n(z_0) - \int_\gamma g(t) dt \right) + (w_0- f_n(z_0))\right| \\
& \leq \left| f_n(z)- f_n(z_0) - \int_\gamma g(t) dt \right| + |w_0- f_n(z_0)| \\
&\leq (2\delta k+1)/m \\
& \to 0 \text{ as } m \to \infty
\end{align*}
Thus $f_n$ converges uniformly to $w_0 + \int_{z_0} ^ z g(t) dt $ on compact subsets of $D$ [every compact subset is contained in a  connected compact subset which contains $z_0$].","['complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

184296,Lower bounds for the partition function,"In this question we consider the partition function $p(n)$ - that is, the number of ways to express $n$ as a sum of positive integers.

So every partition is of a very specific way.

Since the intersection of these subgroups must be $1$ , it follows that $G$ is a direct product of these two subgroups. But subgroups of order $p^{2}$ are abelian, where $p$ is a prime. Thus $G$ is abelian. The question I have upon completing this proof is that it seems to imply that $G$ is isomorphic to $\Bbb Z_{25} \times \Bbb Z_{49}$ .

Now, he doesn't give an explicit definition of $[x]$, so I'm going with this one: DEFINITION Given  $x\in \Bbb R$, the integer part of $x$ is the unique $z\in \Bbb Z$ such that $$z\leq x < z+1$$ and we denote it by $[x]$. Now he asks to prove some basic things about it, such as: if $n\in \Bbb Z$, then $[x+n]=[x]+n$ So I proved it like this: Let $z=[x+n]$ and $z'=[x]$. Then we have that $$z\leq x+n<z+1$$ $$z'\leq x<z'+1$$ Then $$z'+n\leq x+n<z'+n+1$$ But since $z'$ is an integer, so is $z'+n$. Since $z$ is unique, it must be that $z'+n=z$. However, this doesn't seem to get me anywhere to prove that 
$$\left[ {2x} \right] = \left[ x \right] + \left[ {x + \frac{1}{2}} \right]$$ in and in general that $$\left[ {nx} \right] = \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{n - 1} {\left[ {x + \frac{k}{n}} \right]} $$ Obviously one could do an informal proof thinking about ""the carries"", but that's not the idea, let alone how tedious it would be.

$$[-x]=\begin{cases}-[x]\text{ ; if }x\in \Bbb Z \cr-[x]-1 \text{ ; otherwise}\end{cases}$$ I argue: if $x\in\Bbb Z$, it is clear $[x]=x$. Then $-[x]=-x$, and $-[x]\in \Bbb Z$ so $[-[x]]=-[x]=[-x]$. For the other, I guess one could say: $$n \leqslant x < n + 1 \Rightarrow  - n - 1 < x \leqslant -n$$ and since $x$ is not an integer, this should be the same as $$ - n - 1 \leqslant -x < -n$$ $$ - n - 1 \leqslant -x < (-n-1)+1$$ So $[-x]=-[x]-1$","['summation', 'calculus', 'ceiling-and-floor-functions']"

I want to show that such a process is Markov w.r.t. $\mathcal{F_{t}}, \ $ i.e. $$\mathbb{P}[B_{t \land T_{0}} \in \Gamma | \mathcal{F}_{s}]=\mathbb{P}[B_{t \land T_{0}} \in \Gamma |B_{s \land T_{0}}]$$ for every pair of $0<s<t$.

$$\phi\colon w\mapsto \int_0^w\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}$$
on $\mathbb{C}\setminus[-1,1]$ to get $\phi$ well-defined up to periods of the integral. The choice of the interval $[-1,1]$ is made so that $\sqrt{1-z^2}$ admits a single-valued branch. Now, I know that the principal branch of the square root $\sqrt{z}$ is discontinuous on the half-line $(-\infty,0)$, so to get a holomorphic map we restrict to $\mathbb{C}\setminus (-\infty,0]$. Substituting $1-z^2$ for $z$ we get that the appropriate branch cuts for the above mapping $\sqrt{1-z^2}$ would be $(-\infty,-1]$ and $[1,\infty)$, which is somewhat the opposite of the suggested interval $[-1,1]$. From that I conclude that they didn't choose the principal branch, otherwise for e.g. $z=2$ the map would be discontinuous. My question is: Are both choices possible? Then there must be some way to choose another branch of $\sqrt{1-z^2}$. Is there a good way to see how to choose ""elegant"" branch cuts and the corresponding holomorphic branches?

Write down variations of it and compute the corresponding variational field. Conclude that $S^n $ has constant sectional curvature $1$. I tried the following: The geodesic is given by $$\gamma (t)= \exp_p tv.$$ A variation of this geodesic could look something like this: $$f(s,t) = \exp_p t v(s),$$ where $v(0)=v$, $v'(0)=w$ and $|v|=1$. The variational field is: $$V(t)=\frac{\partial f }{\partial s}(0,t)=(d\exp_p)_{tv}(tw).$$ For calculating the sectional curvature I tried to use the formula for the second variation $$\frac{1}{2}E''(0)=0=-\int_0^\pi \left\langle V, \frac{D^2V}{dt^2}+R(\gamma',V)\gamma '\right\rangle ~dt,$$ where the left side is zero because $f(s,t)$ is a geodesic for all $s$. I then tried to show, that $\left\langle V, \frac{D^2V}{dt^2}\right\rangle=-1$ (i.e. $\frac{D^2V}{dt^2}=-V$) because then i would get $\langle V,R(\gamma',V)\gamma\rangle =1$ .

184463,How was the Monster's existence originally suspected?,"I've read in many places that the Monster group was suspected to exist before it was actually proven to exist, and further that many of its properties were deduced contingent upon existence.

Subsequent work by Fischer, Conway, Norton and Thompson estimated the order of $M$ and discovered other properties and subgroups, assuming that it existed. Or Wikipedia , The Monster was predicted by Bernd Fischer (unpublished) and Robert Griess (1976) in about 1973 as a simple group containing a double cover of Fischer's baby monster group as a centralizer of an involution. Within a few months the order of $M$ was found by Griess using the Thompson order formula [...] Or The Spirit of Moonshine , Its existence is a non-trivial fact: when the original moonshine
  conjectures were made, mathematicians suspected its existence, and had been able to work
  out its character table, but could not prove it actually existed. They did know that the
  dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations would be 1, 196883; and 21296876.

Take for instance the description in this AMS review of Moonshine Beyond the Monster : The proof of the moonshine conjectures depends on several coincidences. Even
  the existence of the monster seems to be a ﬂuke in any of the known constructions:
  these all depend on long, strange calculations that just happen to work for no
  obvious reason, and would not have been done if the monster had not already been

The collection $\mathcal{C}$ is said to shatter $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ if $\mathcal{C}$ picks out each of its $2^n$ subsets. The VC index $V(\mathcal{C})$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is the smallest $n$ for which no set of size $n$ is shattered by $\mathcal{C}$. A collection of sets is called a VC class if its VC index is finite. A collection of functions $\mathcal{F}:=\{f:\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{R}\}$ is said to be a VC class of functions if the collection of all subgraphs $\{(x,t):f(x)<t\}$, if $f$ ranges over $\mathcal{F}$, forms a VC class of sets in $\mathcal{X}\times\mathbb{R}$. Then goes a proposition : A collection of sets $C$ is a VC class of sets if and only if the collection of corresponding indicator functions $1_C$ is a VC class of functions. It is said to be not difficult to see but I got stuck trying to prove it. Say $V(\mathcal{C})=n$.

Note that this task is on the part of the test without calculator. My first thought was that the whole thing is 90 degrees. And the other to angles I can fine easily. AB is 1 and BE is 0.5. And the length of AE is $\frac{\sqrt 5}{2}$. So I calculate the angle for the bottom triangle. $sin \space = \frac{BE}{AE} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt 5}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt 5}$ I know that sine of 90 is 1, right. Now it all falls apart, the following is wrong. 
The angle on the top side of the red angle is equal to the one just calculated. So I did this. $1 - 2 \times \frac{1}{\sqrt 5}$ And expected to get $\frac{3}{5}$, which I didn't. The following is correct. $\arcsin(1) - 2 \times \arcsin(\frac{1}{\sqrt 5}) = 36.86$ $\arcsin(\frac{3}{5}) = 36.86$ Why won't the expression without arcsin give me $\frac{3}{5}$ ?

The set of primitive $m$-th roots of unity is $A_m=\{\zeta_k:\zeta_k^m=1,\zeta_k\text{ is primitive}\}$. Hence, the set of all primitive roots $A$ is given by the union of $A_m$ over $m=1,2,3,\ldots$. But I can't seem to get started on how to prove that $A$ is dense in $D$.",['general-topology']
184667,Countability of irrationals,"Since the reals are uncountable, rationals countable and rationals + irrationals = reals, it follows that the irrational numbers are uncountable. I think I've found a ""disproof"" of this fact, and I can't see the error. Since $Q$ is countable, list $q_1, q_2, \dots$ such that $q_i < q_{i+1}$. I want to show that between $q_i$ and $q_{i+1}$ there is exactly one irrational number; this will give us a bijection and prove the irrationals countable. Since the irrationals are dense, it follows that there is at least one irrational number in $\left(q_i,q_{i+1}\right)$. Suppose there was more than one in this range, e.g. $x$ and $y$. Since $(x,y)$ is an open subset of $R$ and the rationals are dense, there must be some rational $q_c$ in this interval. But that means $q_i<q_c<q_{i+1}$, which contradicts our ordering. So there must be exactly one irrational in this range. QED. Where is the problem? The only thing I can think of is that the rationals can be put into a sequence, but cannot be put into an increasing sequence, which seems odd.","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

184708,non-intuitive results in random sampling,"I play a card game (Magic The Gathering) that involves creating a deck of cards that can loosely be split into two categories: land and spells. You are permitted to play only one land per turn, and the land are used to cast your spells. Due to the one-per-turn limitation, it is advantageous to have access to exactly X land on turn X (otherwise your hand  is wasted on land you can't play.) For purposes of my current experiment, I consider myself to be in a good position if on turn X, I have access to (that is, have either drawn or played) either X, X+1, or X+2 land. Having access to X-1 land means I'm not playing spells of cost X on turn X, while my opponent is, so I'm probably at a disadvantage. Having X+3 or more land on turn X means I don't have a good choice of spells to play. I desire the happy medium, with the potential buffer of 2 extras. You start the game with 7 cards, and draw an additional card every turn. There are other effects that can cause you to draw more, discard more, play additional lands, or play more powerful lands, but these are edge cases that are not included in this experiment. In order to gather data, I wrote a small java application that enables me to simulate drawing cards from my deck. The experiment consists of a 40 card deck with either 16 or 17 land. (A good rule of thumb is 40% land.) For simulation purposes, I do monte-carlo of 1 million hand draws. Here are the results for having 16 land.

Naive Guess: Suppose $X$ is a second countable locally compact Hausdorff space.  Then $C_0(X)$ is separable. Proposed Proof: Since $X$ is second countable, so is its one-point compactification $\tilde{X}$.  By the theorem above $C(\tilde{X})$ is is separable, and thus $C_0(X)$ is separable since subspaces of separable metric spaces are separable (not true for subspaces of arbitrary separable spaces, but OK for separable metric spaces).

184769,Average Number of Blocks in a Partition Containing a Large Block,"Notation Let $[n]$ denote the set of integers from 1 up to $n$,
inclusive. Let $A_n$ denote the average number of blocks over all partitions of $[n]$. Let $B_n$ denote the number of partitions of $[n]$ (the $n$th Bell number). Question For any given $n \geq 1$, how small can $m$ be (as a function of $n$) and still ensure
$$
A_{n-m} + 1 < A_n$$
(or, equivalently,
$$
\frac{B_{n+1-m}}{B_{n-m}} < \frac{B_{n+1}}{B_n}-1)?
$$ Remarks The lefthand side of the inequality comes from fixing a particular block of size $m$ and considering all partitions of $[n]$ containing that fixed block. The idea is that if a partition contains a single large block, the expected number of blocks must fall. For my purposes, smaller values of $m$ are superior, but I would be interested to see anything. The following reasoning led me to believe $m = \lceil n / A_n \rceil$ would be big enough. The average size of a block in a partition of $[n]$ is at most $\lceil n / A_n \rceil$. Having a single larger-than-average block should reduce the average number of blocks appearing in such a partition. Exploring with Maple shows $\lceil n / A_n \rceil$ is not quite big enough to establish the inequality, but $\lceil n / A_n \rceil + 1$ works for $n \leq 500$. I keep mentioning averages because I'm hoping there is a quick proof of the kind I attempted in the preceding paragraph. If that vantage point is not helpful, there is the alternative statement of the inequality in terms of Bell numbers. This expression can possibly be analyzed asymptotically (though the Moser-Wyman expansion fails here), but I was rather hoping to avoid it. Still, any suggestions in this direction are welcome.","['set-partition', 'combinatorics']"

184777,Hermitian/positive definite matrices and their analogues in complex numbers,"I've heard a couple of times some people say that in a way, Hermitian matrices are to matrices as real numbers are to complex numbers. I know two examples where this is sort of true: Complex conjugate vs conjugate transpose We can realize complex numbers as a set of matrices, where complex number $z = a + bi$ corresponds to a matrix $$A = \begin{bmatrix}a & -b \\ b & a\end{bmatrix}$$ Then the conjugate $\bar{z} = a - bi$ corresponds to the conjugate transpose $A^*$. A complex number is real if and only if $z = \bar{z}$. On the other hand, matrix $A$ is called Hermitian if and only if $A = A^*$. Polar form vs polar decomposition: We can represent every complex number $z$ as $z = re^{i\varphi}$, where $r \geq 0$ and $\varphi \in [0, 2\pi[$. This representation is unique when $z \neq 0$. On the other hand, any $n \times n$ matrix $A$ with complex entries can be represented as $A = RU$ where $R$ is positive semidefinite (thus Hermitian) and $U$ is unitary. This representation is unique when $A$ is invertible. Also, if $\det A = re^{i\varphi}$, then $\det R = r$ and $\det U = e^{i\varphi}$. Taking the second example really far, you could say positive semidefinite matrices are like nonnegative real numbers and unitary matrices are like points on the unit circle. Are there more examples?

  $f(g) = f(g')$, and $e_{H} = f(g)^{-1} · f(g') = f(g^{−1}) · f(g) = f(g^{−1}g')$

and if we chose 2, we got 1, 2, 2 and the game ends. Suppose the expected number is S , we can write S = 1/2 * (S + 1) + 1/2 * (1) and we get S = 2 Things become very complicated when N > 2 , so I turn for help.

I tried doing something like $(a*b)^{-1} * (a*b) =  e = a * a^{-1} * b^{-1} * b $ $(a*b)^{-1} * (a*b) =  e = a * (a^{-1} * b^{-1}) * b $ However, I can't get the RHS to $ (a * b)* (a^{-1} * b^{-1}) $ without assuming communitivity. How would I go about doing this? Any help is appreciated. Thanks Edit: Given that correction, would this be correct? $ (a*b)^{-1} * (a*b) = e = a*(b*b^{-1})*a^{-1}$ Then $ a*(b*b^{-1})*a^{-1} = a*b* (b^{-1}*a^{-1}) = (a*b)*(b^{-1}*a^{-1})$ Thus $ (a*b)^{-1} = (b^{-1}*a^{-1})$",['group-theory']

Let us adopt the convention that $A \in R^{m \times n}$ while $C \in R^{k \times n}$ so the answer should be in terms of $m,n,k$. Further, one may suppose that entries of $P$ are rational numbers whose numerators and denominators take $B$ bits to specify, so that in the bit-model answers should be in terms of $B$ as well.","['convex-analysis', 'linear-algebra', 'polyhedra']"

184980,Elliptic functions and (meromorphic) simply periodic functions.,"Let be $f:\mathbb C\rightarrow\overline {\mathbb C}$ a meromorphic function. The set of periods $\Omega_f$ is a discrete (additive) group and we have one of these possibilities: i) $\Omega_f= \{0\}$ ii) $\Omega_f= \mathbb Z\omega$ iii) $\Omega_f= \mathbb Z\omega_1+\mathbb Z\omega_2$ In the case iii) we say that $f$ is an elliptic function and we now that the foundamental regions are compact subset of $\mathbb C$ (for example foundamental parallelograms). Elliptic fuctions, respect a fixed group of periodicities $\Omega_f=\Lambda$, form a field $E(\Lambda)$ and one can prove that $E(\Lambda)=\mathbb C(\wp,\wp')$. Now I have not found in literature similar results for the case ii) of meromorphic simply periodic functions. In this case foudamental regions are not compact sets and, fixed the group $\Omega_f$, simply periodic functions respect $\Omega_f$ form a field. I ask if this field is in fact $\mathbb C\big(e^\frac{2\pi iz}{\omega}\big)$; moreover what is the relation beethween the meromorphic functions: $$\varepsilon_k=\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}(z-n)^{-k}$$ and the field of simply periodic funcion, where $\Omega_f=\mathbb Z$?","['elliptic-functions', 'complex-analysis', 'periodic-functions']"
