1892350,Dirichlet-multinomial distribution,"I'm reading ""Microbiome, Metagenomics, and High-Dimensional Compositional Data Analysis"" by Li ( Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application , 2015). There is a part on using Dirichlet-multinomial to model joint-count data that I don't quite follow. In addition to scalar summary statistics, such as $\alpha$-and
  $\beta$-diversity, one can directly model observed taxa count data
  using Dirichlet multinomial regression (La Rosa et al. 2012, Chen & Li
  2013b, Holmes et al. 2012). One advantage of this approach is that it
  automatically accounts for measurement errors and other uncertainties
  associated with the counts. Suppose we have $p$ bacterial taxa, and
  their counts $ n = ( {n}_{1}, {n}_{2},..., {n}_{p} ) $ follow a
  multinomial distribution with probability mass function 
  $$ 			{f}_{M}( {n}_{1}, \dots, {n}_{p}; \phi) = \binom{ {n}_{+} }{ n } \prod_{j=1}^{p}{ {\phi}_{j}^{ {n}_{j} } },  
$$
  where $ {n}_{+} = \sum_{ j=1 }^{ p }{ {n}_{j} } $ and $\phi = ({\phi}_{1}, {\phi}_{2}, \dots, {\phi}_{p} )$ are underlying species proportions for which $\sum_{ j=1 }^{ p }{ {\phi}_{j} } = 1$. Okay, here I don't get what is $n$ in the binomial coefficient. Moving further... For microbiome composition data, the observed variation is usually
  larger than what would be predicted by the multinomial model. This
  increased variation results from the heterogeneity of the microbiome
  samples and from variation among samples in the underlying
  proportions. To account for the extra variation or overdispersion, we
  assume the underlying proportions are themselves positive random
  variables $ ( {\Phi}_{1}, {\Phi}_{2}, \dots, {\Phi}_{p} ) $, subject
  to the constraint $ \sum_{ j=1 }^{ p }{ {\Phi}_{j} } = 1$. This
  assumption implies that the underlying proportions follow a Dirichlet
  distribution $ Dir( {\gamma}_{1}, {\gamma}_{2}, \dots, {\gamma}_{p} )
$. The counts then marginally follow a Dirichlet-multinomial (DM)
  distribution, 
  $$ 	{f}_{DM}( {n}_{1}, \dots, {n}_{p}; \gamma ) =
\binom{ {n}_{+} }{ \mathbf{y} } \frac{ \Gamma( {n}_{+} + 1 ) \Gamma(
{\gamma}_{+} ) }{ \Gamma( {n}_{+} + {\gamma}_{+} ) }  \prod_{ j=1 }^{
p }{ \frac{ \Gamma( {n}_{j} + {\gamma}_{j} ) }{ \Gamma( {\gamma}_{j} )
\Gamma( {n}_{j} + 1 ) } } 
$$
  To relate a $q$-dimensional covariate vector $ \mathbf{Z} = ( {z}_{1}, {z}_{2}, \dots, {z}_{q} ) $ to taxa composition, we assume that the parameters $ {\gamma}_{j} $ in the DM model depend on the covariates via a log-linear model
  $$
{\gamma}_{j} (\mathbf{Z}) = \exp \left ( {\alpha}_{j} + \sum_{k=1}^{q}{ {\beta}_{jk} {z}_{k} } \right ),
$$
  where $ {\beta}_{jk} $ measures the effect on the $j$-th taxon of the $k$-th covariate. Here I don't get what is $ \mathbf{y} $. I suppose $ {\gamma}_{+} $
is the sum over $ \gamma $, though the author doesn't state it explicitly. The author says nothing about $\alpha$ either. In both cases I suppose that the author uses the notation for binomial coefficient to actually represent multidimensional slices of $p-1$-dimensional Pascal simplex. Am I right?","['statistics', 'mathematical-modeling', 'multinomial-coefficients', 'probability-distributions']"
1892367,Generalization of Euclidean Similarity,"In Euclidean geometry two polygons are said to be similar if, by rotation and scaling, one can be transformed into the other, and vice versa. If we consider a general metric space, does this notion exist? I can think of how this works by scaling: you consider $d(a_i , a_{I+1} )$, where $a_i$ are the vertices of the polygon, then two figures are similar if each pair can be scaled with the same constant to yield the distances of the second figure. My problem is more with rotation and angle. The notion if homeomorphic is too general because all (non-self intersecting) polygons are homeomorphic.","['metric-spaces', 'metric-geometry', 'geometry']"

1892412,"If $A$ and $B$ are integral domains, how to make $A\times B$ an integral domain?","I've been lately reading a bit of ring theory and when I reached the 'Integral Domains' section a question suddenly arised and it seems pretty natural to me. It is clear that if $A$ and $B$ are integral domains, then $A\times B$ is not neccesarily an integral domain (if the product on $A\times B$ is defined by $(a,b)(a',b')=(aa',bb')$). In fact, if $A$, and $B$ are rings with unit, $A\times B$ is NOT an integral domain as $(1,0')(0,1')=(0,0')$. The question is Is it possible to define a 'canonical' product on $A\times B$ in order to make it into an integral domain? With 'canonical' I mean 'definable from the operations on $A$ and $B$, or from some fixed relation between them' (for example, when the semi-direct product on groups is defined it only depends on a certain homomorphism from a group $G$ to the automorphism group of another group $H$).

1892423,Zeta Function In Real And Imaginary Parts,The zeta function is defined for a complex input $s$: $$\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}}$$ What I am wondering is if there are functions $f$ and $g$ such that: $$\zeta(s) = f(s) + ig(s)$$ By using simple algebra on the Dirichlet series you can show that the real and imaginary components are separable into the form: $$\zeta(\sigma + it) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(t\ln(n))}{n^\sigma} - i\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(t\ln(n))}{n^\sigma}$$ Are there any other functions like this?

1892441,Do derivations over a commutative ring form a ring?,"Given a commutative ring $R$ and a derivation $D : R \rightarrow R$, we might consider a ring built over ""differential operators"" built over this operator, with the elements of the ring being spans of the operators $D,D^2,D^3,\dots$ over the ring $R$. For example, if $R$ is the ring of smooth functions $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, an example of such an element of this ring would be $sin(x) \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + 5\frac{d}{dx}$. Multiplication in this ring is just composition of operators, and addition is just operator addition. Does this construction actually give a ring in general? If this is a ring, what are its properties? (Specifically, I'd like to know if $R$ is reduced, and $D$ is a derivation on $R$, is the ring of differential operators over $R$ also reduced? But that might be better as another question) What is such a ring typically called in the literature?","['abstract-algebra', 'reference-request', 'differential-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1892477,Prove that $ T $ is at most countable,"There is a theorem from Rudin's $ \textit{Principle of Mathematical Analysis} $ which says that if $ \displaystyle \{E_{n}\}, \; n = 1, 2, 3, \dots $ is a sequence of countable sets, then their union $ \displaystyle S = \bigcup\limits_{n = 1}^{\infty} \; E_{n} $ is at most countable. I have successfully understood the proof for this theorem. (The notion of a countable set used in Rudin's book is slightly different from the one I find on Wikipedia, please see below for the clarification of the concept.) Rudin then goes on to this theorem: Let $ A $ be an at most countable set and for every $ \alpha \in A, \; B_{\alpha} $ is at most countable. Prove that $ \displaystyle T = \bigcup\limits_{\alpha \; \in \; A} \; B_{\alpha} $ is at most countable. He says that since $ T $ is equivalent to a subset of $ S $ from above, this theorem must be true, but I can't see why it is the case. Specifically, if all the $ B_{\alpha} $s are finite or if they are all countable, then $ T $ is finite or countable and hence $ T $ is at most countable. But what happens when some $ B_{\alpha} $s are finite and some are countable? In addition, I don't see the reason why the set $ A $ must be at most countable? Any help would be appreciated! Some definitions used in Rudin's book: Let $ M $ be a set and $ J_{n} $ be the set of all positive integers up to $ n, $ then $ M $ is finite if there is a bijection from $ M $ to $ J_{n} $ for some positive integer $ n, M $ is countable if there is a bijection from $ M $ to $ \mathbb{Z}^{+}, $ and $ M $ is at most countable if $ M $ is finite or countable.",['elementary-set-theory']

I suspect that there is no continuous path from $K_1$ to $K_2$ (try imagining what such a thing would look like), but don't know how to approach showing this. I don't know how to wrangle anything useful out of the notion of a continuous path in $\mathcal K(C)$. It's not hard to show that if $X$ is connected, so is $\mathcal K(X)$. I read the corresponding question about path connectedness a while back in C.C. Pugh's Real Mathematical Analysis .

1892744,Irrationals yet as ordered pairs of rationals?,"Let's consider the naturals $\mathbb{N}$ as being given . Then we have the following sequence of extensions: The whole numbers $\mathbb{Z}$ are defined as ordered pairs of naturals
(: Wikipedia ) The rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ are defined as ordered pairs of whole numbers
(: Wikipedia ) The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ are not defined as ordered pairs of rational numbers
(: Wikipedia ) The complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ are defined as ordered pairs of real numbers
(: Wikipedia ) All extensions of the number system are such that many important properties of the previous number type
are inherited. Three out of four extensions are done by the formation of ordered pairs, with proper
definitions of the four basic operations: addition, substraction, multiplication and division.
The step from the rational numbers to the real numbers, however, differs essentially from the other extensions.
According to standard mathematics, it cannot be done by considering pairs of rational numbers. But let's be
stubborn and nevertheless try the following Definition. A real number $r$ is an ordered pair of rationals $(a,b)$ such that $a < b$.
The absolute difference $|a-b|$ is called the error of the real number $r$.
The main problem is to minimize the error (i.e. preferrably there is a limit that makes it zero).
The idea is that irrational numbers can be understood as the number squeezed between ever more
converging pairs of rational numbers. It is noticed, however, that this idea is rather an idealization of a not-so-nice reality, where errors do really exist. Example 1. Let the real number $\,e\,$ for any natural $n$ be defined by 
$$e = \left(\left[1+\frac{1}{n}\right]^n , \left[1+\frac{1}{n}\right]^{n+1}\right)$$
Where it is noticed that there is a lot of theory in $\mathbb{Q}$ preceding this.
The error can be made as minimal as desired with help of a theory about limits in $\mathbb{Q}$,
which is assumed to be fully developed:
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \left[ \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n+1}-\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n \right]
=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n\frac{1}{n} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{e}{n}=0$$ Example 2. Let the real number $\,\pi\,$ for any natural $n$ be defined by Leibniz formula :
$$
\pi = \left( 4\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} \frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} , 4\sum_{k=0}^{2n} \frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)
$$
Again, the error can be made as minimal as desired:
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \left[ 4\sum_{k=0}^{2n} \frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} - 4\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} \frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} \right]
= \lim_{n\to\infty} 4 \frac{(-1)^{2n}}{4n+1} = 0

where $\color{orange}{C}=\frac{\omega_pq}{ck}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z^2}-\lambda z},\quad k\text{ and }z\text{ are free variables}$ Then substitute $\color{red}{R}\to\frac{\omega_pq}{ck}\color{red}{R},\quad \color{blue}{E}\to\frac{\omega_pq}{ck}\color{blue}{E},\quad\color{orange}{C}\to\frac{\omega_pq}{ck}\color{orange}{C}\quad$ and divide both eq. by $\frac{\omega_pq}{ck}$ New $\color{orange}{C}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z^2}-\lambda z}$ Now I look for solution in form of $\color{red}{R}=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\color{red}{R^i}\frac{1}{k^i},\quad\color{blue}{E_z}=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\color{blue}{E^i}\frac{1}{k^i},\quad$where in case of $\frac{1}{k^i}-$ $i$ means power, in other cases upper index.

1892907,What are the measurement units of Fisher information? (Dimensional Analysis),"I know that there is a strong relationship between Shannon entropy and thermodynamic entropy -- they even have the same units and differ only by a constant factor. This suggests that they both intrinsically describe the same fundamental concept. Wikipedia says that there is a strong relationship between Fisher information and relative entropy (also called Kullback-Leibler divergence), as does an answer to a previous question on Math.SE. However, looking at the relevant formulas, it does not look like Fisher information would be measured with the same units that relative entropy would. This suggests that they are measuring fundamentally distinct, albeit related, physical concepts. The formula for the Shannon entropy can be written as follows: $$\int  [ - \log p(x) ]\ p(x) \, dx $$ This is usually measured in bits. What are the units of Fisher information (given that Shannon entropy can be measured in bits)? Fisher information can be written as: $$\int \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log p(x; \theta) \right)^2 p(x;\theta) \, dx $$ My guess, based on comparing the definitions of Shannon entropy and Fisher information, is that the latter would be measured in units something like $$\frac{\text{bit}^2}{\Theta^2} $$ where $\Theta$ is the unit of measurement of the parameter $\theta$ that is to be estimated. I am not quite sure how to account for the effects of the extra partial differentiation compared to the definition of Shannon entropy. Perhaps the expectation operation $\int ( \cdot) p(y) \, dy$ should leave the units unchanged, although I don't know how to give a non-intuitive explanation of this suspicion. Since the Fisher information is the variance of the score, this question might be answered by first deriving the units of the score. This question might be related, although it was unanswered.","['information-theory', 'fisher-information', 'statistics', 'dimensional-analysis']"

If $X(t)$ is a white noise process the correlation function is given by the Dirac delta function $\rho(t_1-t_2) = \delta(t_1-t_2)$. The integral of this process is given by: $$I = \int_0^L X(t) \, dt$$ According to this CrossValidated post the variance of $I$ is given by: $$\text{Var}[I] = L\sigma^2$$ However this does not agree with the results I obtained through simulation. The approach is to discretise the white noise Gaussian process into $N$ independent normal variables. The integral can then be approximated through: $$ I = \int_0^L X(t) \approx \frac{L}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NX_i$$ Where $X_i$ are indepedent random variables $X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$.

1892976,The Space $\mathcal{D}(\Omega)$ of Test Functions is Not a Sequential Space,"Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a nonempty open set, and $\mathcal{D}(\Omega)$ the 
space of test functions (that is infinitely differentiable functions 
$f:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ with compact support contained in $\Omega$), with the usual 
topology defined through inductive limit of Fréchet spaces (see Distribution or any good book which deals with distributions as Rudin, Functional Analysis, or Reed and Simon, Methods of Mathematical Physics, Volume I or the wonderful Schwartz, Théorie des Distributions). Now, let us recall that a topological space $X$ is called a Fréchet-Urysohn space if for every $A \subseteq X$, the closure of $A$ coincides with the sequential closure $[A]_{seq}$ of $A$, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
[A]_{seq} = \{ x \in X : \exists (a_j)_{j=0}^{\infty} :   a_j \rightarrow x  \textrm{ and }  a_j \in A \textrm{ for } j=0,1,2,\dots \}.

A set $A \subseteq X$ for which $A= [A]_{seq}$ is called sequentially closed. Note that every closed set $A$ is sequentially closed. If also the converse is true, that is if every sequentially closed set turns out to be closed, the space $X$ is called a sequential space (see Sequential Space for more details and references about sequential spaces). 
Clearly, every Fréchet-Urysohn space is a sequential space, but the converse is not true (see the post Understanding two similar definitions ). With this terminology we may ask: is $\mathcal{D}(\Omega)$ a Fréchet-Urysohn space? Is it a sequential space? The answer to these two questions is negative, as I will show in my answer below.

Let $a_n=a-\frac{T(a)x_n}{T(x_n)}$. See that $a_n$ is in kernel of $T$ and $a_n\rightarrow a$ as $x_n$ is of norm $1$ and $Tx_n$ diverges.

Each time we can get Heads (H) or Tails (T) , regardless of whether it is fair or not. So for example this is one possible outcome: HHHHHHHHHH ie 10 heads. Let's call this a 10-toss sequence. The total number of possible 10-toss sequences is 2^10 because each toss has 2 possible outcomes: Heads or Tails. --The first question is What is the meaning of 10!/(3!7!) ? The answer is that It is the total number of ways, by which we can place the three heads inside the 10-toss sequence. The order by which we place the three heads does not matter. --The second question is : What is the total number of possible 3-head sequences?
Is it 10!/(3!7!)? Some say YES. Others, say NO. A 10-toss sequence with three heads, can be this one: HHH THTHTHT. So three positions are fixed to 'heads'. The remaining seven positions can be H or T. So we have 2^7 possible 7-toss sequences. And the three heads can be anywhere in this 10-toss sequence.

That is in the 10-toss sequence the number of ways by which we can place 3 heads is 10!/(3!7!). Then, we have to say something about the remaining 7-toss sequence. Each position can take Heads or Tails . So 2^7 is the possible number of this 7-toss sequence. However, I know that the correct answer is 10!/(3!7!) and that we don't need to multiply by 2^7.

This is because $\mathbb{CP}^2\#\mathbb{CP}^2$ has a definite intersection form but the intersection form of $\mathbb{CP}^2\mathbin{\#}\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ is indefinite, and any homeomorphism can only change the signature of the intersection form by $\pm{1}$ according to whether it preserves or changes the orientation. (Question 1: Is this argument okay?) Now, on some level I find this completely flummoxing. The manifolds $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and $\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ $\it{are}$ homeomorphic (not as manifolds with orientation however, since $\mathbb{CP}^2$ has no orientation-reversing self-homeomorphisms). So you take two copies of the same manifold and glue them together, but the second time you do the gluing of the second manifold in the mirror (but this image is still homeomorphic to the original!), and you get two different results.

Does there exist a ""measure"" function $\mu: \mathcal{B} \to X$ satisfying the following conditions? $\mu(\varnothing) = \boldsymbol{0}$. For all $d \in [0,\infty)$, if $A \in \mathcal{B}$ and $\mu_d$ is $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure , then:
$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\mu(A)(x)}{x^d} = \mu_d(A).$$
(Specifically if $A$ has Hausdorff dimension $d$ and measure $a$ in that dimension, we want it to grow like $ax^d$, if $a \ne 0, \infty$.) $\mu$ is countably additive, in the following sense: let $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$ be disjoint Borel sets with union $A$,
$\mu(A_n) = f_n$ and $\mu(A) = f$.
If $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n$ converges uniformly on compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, then $$

What about 1-3? Motivation While Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$ fails to capture any size differences between different measure-zero sets, we can capture such information with the Hausdorff dimension . By identifying a set with its Hausdorff dimension and its Hausdorff measure in that dimension, we get a much richer notion of size. For example, $\varnothing$ (dimension 0 measure 0) is smaller than $\{1,4\}$ (dimension 0 measure $2$), which is smaller than $\mathbb{Q}$ (dimension 0 measure $\infty$), which is smaller than the Cantor set (dimension $\frac{\ln 2}{\ln 3}$ measure $1$) which is smaller than $[0,1]$ (dimension $1$ measure $1$), which is smaller than $\mathbb{R}$ (dimension $1$ measure $\infty$).

$$g_{0}\left(X,\,Y\right)=\frac{1}{2}\mbox{Tr}\left(X^{T}Y\right),$$
Then I define a leftinvariant metric defined  for every point $R$ in $SO(3)$ through the left action, i.e.
$$g\left(X,\,Y\right)=g_{0}\left(L_{R^{-1}*}\left(X\right),\,L_{R^{-1}*}\left(Y\right)\right).$$ It's clearly left invariant by construction. Now let's say I take the following base $\left\{\left(E_{1}\right)_{R},...,\left(E_{n}\right)_{R}\right\} $ for the point of the tangent space in $R$ where $$\left(E_{1}\right)_{R}=L_{R*}\left(\left(E_{1}\right)_{\mathbb{1}}\right)$$
 where of course $\left\{ \left(E_{1}\right)_{\mathbb{1}},...,\left(E_{n}\right)_{\mathbb{1}}\right\} $ is the canonical base at the identity.
Now it should be that 
$$g\left(\left(E_{i}\right)_{R},\,\left(E_{j}\right)_{R}\right)	=	\frac{1}{2}\mbox{Tr}\left(\left(R\left(E_{i}\right)_{\mathbb{1}}\right)^{T}\left(R^{-1}\right)^{T}\left(R^{-1}\right)\left(R\left(E_{j}\right)_{\mathbb{1}}\right)\right)=

So that the coefficient of the metric in the base given by $ \left\{ \left(E_{1}\right)_{R},...,\left(E_{n}\right)_{R}\right\}$ are constant.
Being that the Christoffel Symbols are identically zero and I have that $\nabla_{X}Y$ is nothing else that the partial derivative in the point. Defining the torsion $$T\left(X,Y\right)=\nabla_{X}Y-\nabla_{Y}X-\left[X,Y\right].$$ I then have $$T\left(X,Y\right)=-\left[X,Y\right],$$ and therefore in the base

1893963,"""The music of the primes"" by Sautoy: Is $\sqrt x$ correct?","I have recently read ""The music of the primes"" by Marcus du Sautoy (see excerpt here >>> ). There he writes: ""So how fair are the prime number dice? Mathematicians call a dice ""fair"" if the difference between the theoretical behaviour of the dice and the actual behaviour after $N$ tosses is within the region of the square root of $N$. The heights of Riemann's harmonics are given by the east-west coordinate of the corresponding point at sea-level. If the east-west coordinate is $c$ then the height of the wave grows like $N^c$. This means the contribution from this harmonic to the error between Gauss's guess and the real number of primes will be $N^c$. So if the Riemann Hypothesis is correct and $c$ is always $1/2$, the error will always be $N^{1/2}$ (which is just another way of writing the square root of $N$). If true, the Riemann Hypothesis means that Nature's prime number dice are fair, never straying more than the square root of $N$ from Gauss's theoretical prime number dice."" However, we know from Helge von Koch (1901)[2] that if the Rieman Hypothesis true, then:
$$\pi(x)=Li(x)+\mathcal O(\sqrt x \log x)$$
where $\pi(x)$ prime counting function and $Li(x)$ according Gauss. My question: Is what Sautoy says correct? Is the error indeed $(\sqrt x \log x)$ or as Sautoy states $\sqrt x$?

$$ Hence, am I right to say that $(*)$ is a travelling wave, winding around the $x-$axis to the right with speed $\omega/k$? What I am a bit confused about is that we now have the factor $1/k$. Moreover, when considering $f(x-ct)$ we have one speed $c$ which is multiplicatd with $t$; here, we seem to have two kind of speeds (some spatial, namely $k$, which is multiplied with space $x$ and some temporal, namely $\omega$, which is multiplied with time $t$.

  iff $Q$ is also discrete (not necessarily on the same support), and if  $d(P,Q)=\infty$  the $Q$ is not discrete. Note that Kullback–Leibler divergence almost has this property, since if $P$ and $Q$ are mutually singular than $d(P,Q)=\infty$.  The problem is that if $P$ and $Q$ are discrete but defined on different supports than we also have $d(P,Q)=\infty$. Note that we also want a metric such that for convergence in this metric would imply convergence in distribution. Note that as long as we can find a distance that in some way 'detects' that the distribution is discrete then we can relax  $d(P,Q)=\infty$ if $Q$ is not discrete.
