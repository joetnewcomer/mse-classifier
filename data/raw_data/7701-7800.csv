58239,Linear functions with rounding,"If I convert 47°F to Celsius, rounding to the nearest integer, I get 8°C. If I then convert back to Fahrenheit, again rounding, I get 46°F. Back to Celsius, 8°C. Now of course if I continue this process it will remain stable, going back and forth between 8°C and 46°F. Will it always stabilize, for any given starting value? More generally, suppose I have an arbitrary linear function, $f(x) = ax + b$ , with inverse $f^{-1}(x) = \frac {x - b} a$ . Using the rounding function $r(x) = \lfloor x + \frac 1 2 \rfloor$ , define the round-trip function $g = r \circ f^{-1} \circ r \circ f$ . Then the question is, does $g = g \circ g$ ? If not, is there always some $n$ for which $g^n = g^{n+1}$ ? Empirically, it seems that $g$ is idempotent, but the proof has defied my meagre abilities. Also, are there any more general things we can say? For instance if $f$ isn't necessarily linear, but strictly monotone, does the process of repeatedly applying, rounding, inverting, and rounding again always converge? PS: Please feel free to add meaningful tags to this... I'm not sure what would be appropriate for this question. Edit Vlad has found a counterexample, so let me amend the definition of rounding to be that if the fractional part is exactly .5, it yields the adjacent even number...",['functions']
58244,Which branch of mathematics is this and what are the introductory references?,"I am self-studying a physics textbook on waves. While discussing solutions to linear homogeneous ODEs, the author talked about the exponential as ""irreducible"" solutions  and on a footnote, said that they were, formally, ""irreducible representations of the translation group"". I am understanding the material that is presented in the book, but I think I would like to explore the relevant area of mathematics alongside. Which branch of mathematics is this and what are the introductory references? Another persistent theme in the book is solving differential equations (oscillating systems, but a general approach would also be good for me) using arguments such as linearity and symmetry. What are good books on differential equations that approach the subject in a similar fashion and are accessible. I have studied calculus and ODEs before, but it was very ""application oriented"" and most of the material was presented as ""methods"" (i.e you have a linear 1st order ODE, you use integrating factor, etc). I know with a lot of contemplation I can connect some dots myself, but it will be helpful to have some guiding material.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'self-learning', 'reference-request']"
58255,Range scaling with constraints,"I'm not a mathematician, so sorry for the possible trivial question. I have a set of values in $x_i\in[0,1]$ (say for $i=1,\ldots,n$) whose sum can be greater than $1$.
Now I want to scale them so that the new values $\hat{x}_i$ fall in the interval $[a,b]\subseteq[0,1]$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^n\hat{x}_i=b$.

58265,"Why $X$ independent from $(Y,Z)$ implies that $E(XY^{-1} | Z)= E(X) E(Y^{-1}|Z)$?","I have three random variables. Let $X$ be independent from $(Y,Z)$ ($:=\sigma(Y,Z))$,

From answers to an older question that this follows under the assumption X independent from $(\frac{1}{Y}, Z)$, however I would really like to avoid to have to assume this directly. I know that there is a propositon that for $X_i\colon \Omega \to E_i$ independent, $\varphi_i\colon E_i \to E'_i$ measurable, $\varphi_i \circ X_i$ are independent as well, this used for $(X,Y,Z)$, (id, $x \mapsto \frac{1}{x}$, id$)$,  I have $X,\frac{1}{Y}, Z$ independent, but this means that $\sigma(X), \sigma(\frac{1}{Y}), \sigma(Z)$ are independent, and not $\sigma(X), \sigma(\frac{1}{Y},Z)$.

Hence $$u(t) = Ce^t x_1+ De^{3t}x_2$$ $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the eigenvectors of $A$, and the constants $C$ and $D$ are determined by two initial values $y(0)$ and $z(0)$.

58320,Subgroup of a Finite Group,"Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $S$ be a nonempty subset of $G$. Suppose $S$ is closed with respect to multiplication. Prove that $S$ is a subgroup of $G$. (Hint: It remains to prove that $S$ contains $e$ and is closed with respect to inverses. Let $S = \{a_{1},...,a_{n} \}.$ If $a_{i} \in S$, consider the distinct elements $a_{i}a_{1}, a_{i}a_{2},...a_{i}a_{n}$.) Preliminary questions: Can I assume that every element in $S$ unique? If each element is unique, then does that imply the products $a_{i}a_{1}, a_{i}a_{2},...a_{i}a_{n}$ are distinct? If I cannot assume that each element is not unique, then why should I just consider the distinct products? (i). Show that $S$ contains $e$: Because we know $S$ is closed under multiplication, we know that each element in $S$ can be written as a product of elements in $S$. The book claims that I can write $a_{1} = a_{1}a_{k}$ for some $k$. I don't really understand why I can make such a claim. Does the following explain why? If $a_{1} \in S$ then will one of the following products $a_{1}a_{1}, a_{1}a_{2}, ... , a_{1}a_{n}$ be equal to one element in $S$ and eventually will every product be paired with each element in $S$? How do we know $a_{1} \neq a_{3}a_{2}$? Because if I assume $a_{1} = a_{1}a_{k}$, then $a_{1}^{-1}a_{1} = a_{1}^{-1}a_{1}a_{k}$ shows that $e = a_{k}$. And I can still make use of $a_{1}^{-1}$ because if $a_{1} \in S$, then $a_{1} \in G$ and $a_{1}^{-1} \in G$ since $G$ is a group. Is this reasoning correct? (ii). Show that every element $a_{p} \in S$ has an inverse $a_{p}^{-1} \in S$: Let $a_{p} \in S$, then we can write $a_{p} = a_{1}a_{q}$ for some $q$. We can rearrange and get $a_{q} = a_{1}^{-1}a_{p} = (a_{p}^{-1}a_{1})^{-1}$. At this point I've shown that $(a_{p}^{-1}a_{1})^{-1} \in S$, but now I have been stuck for a while. Could I get a hint? Thanks in advance. Update (i). Show that $S$ contains $e$: Using the hint, ``If $a_{i} \in S$, consider the distinct elements $a_{i}a_{1}, a_{i}a_{2},...a_{i}a_{n}$,"" if $a_{1} \in S$, then we consider $a_{1}a_{1}, a_{1}a_{2},...a_{1}a_{n}$. Then we can write the following:
\begin{align*}
a_{1} &= a_{1}a_{k} \newline
a_{1}^{-1}a_{1} &= a_{1}^{-1}a_{1}a_{k} \newline
e &= ea_{k} \newline
e &= a_{k}
\end{align*} (ii). Show that every element $a_{p} \in S$ has an inverse $a_{p}^{-1} \in S$: To show that $e \in S$, we can write $a_{1}a_{p} = e$ for $a_{1}, a_{p} \in S$
\begin{align*}
a_{1}a_{p} &= e\newline
a_{1}a_{p}a_{p}^{-1} &= ea_{p}^{-1}\newline

58325,The degree of an algebraic curve in higher dimensions,"This might be a very simple question but I can't seem to find a precise definition of the degree of an algebraic curve, if such can even be defined. In the plane, the degree of an algebraic curve is clear; it is simply the degree of the defining polynomial (a curve in the plane is defined by the equation $f(x,y) = 0$, for some polynomial $f$). In higher dimensions, say $n$, an algebraic curve is defined by $n-1$ polynomial equations $f_1 =0, f_2 =0, \cdots, f_{n-1} = 0$. However, the degree of the curve is no longer clear.

58339,"Rate of change of $\mathbb{E}X_{\frac{2^n}{2},2^n}$ as $n$ increases?","I am trying to get an equation that will show the rate of change of the expected value of $\frac{2^n}{2}$th lowest of $2^n$ draws from $X$ as $n$ increases (where $n >1$). Let's call the order statistic in question $X_n$ for shorthand.  Let's define function $g(n) = X_{n+1} -X_n$ as the function I'm looking for.  So, for example, $g(2) = \mathbb{E}X_{4,8} - \mathbb{E}X_{2,4}$ , and  $g(3) = \mathbb{E}X_{8,16} - \mathbb{E}X_{4,8}$ $X$ is represented by cdf $F(x) = (1-(1-x)^2)^2$. The median of this is $m=1-\sqrt{1-1/\sqrt2}$.  I know that as $n\to\infty$, $\mathbb{E}X_n \to m$, and $g(n) \to 0$.  I can manually calculate the values of $g(2) . . . g(6)$ using Mathematica, but the equations I use hang Mathematica after that.  The equation I use is: $$g(n) = \int_0^1 (\sum_{k=\frac{2^{n}}{2}}^{2^{n}} \frac{(2^{n})!}{k!(2^{n}- k)!}F(x)^k(1-F(x))^{2^{n}- k} - \sum_{k=\frac{2^{n+1}}{2}}^{2^{n+1}} \frac{(2^{n+1})!}{k!(2^{n+1}- k)!}F(x)^k(1-F(x))^{2^{n+1}- k})  \, dx $$ Is there any way I can create a manageable $g(n)$ (or otherwise managebley  calculate $\mathbb{E}X_n$) for high values of  $n$?  In terms of underlying problem, what I'm really trying to ultimately calculate is $h(n) = (\mathbb{E}X_{2^n,2^n} -\mathbb{E}X_{\frac{2^n}{2},\frac{2^n}{2}})- (\mathbb{E}X - \mathbb{E}X_{\frac{2^n}{2}, 2^n})  $.  Doing manual caluclations for the first 6 values, this function starts positive, increases, then starts decreasing, with its limit being negative (note the amount of initial increasing increases when I change $F(x)$ to $F(F(x))$ and so on).  My first priority, I suppose, is to know when $h(n) = 0$, but having a manageable way to calculate its value at any $n$ would be fantastic.

58363,How do I prove that the following method to find whether a point lies within a polygon is correct?,"I came across the following method to determine whether a given point lies inside a convex polygon - however, I'm not sure how to prove it. Given any three points on the plane $(x_0,y_0)$ , $(x_1,y_1)$ , and $(x_2,y_2)$ , the area of the triangle determined by them is
given by the following formula: $$A=\frac12\begin{vmatrix}x_0&y_0&1\\x_1&y_1&1\\x_2&y_2&1\end{vmatrix},$$ where the vertical bars represent the determinant.  If you
don't know what a determinant is, it doesn't matter too much;
the value of the expression above is: $$\frac12(x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2 -x_0 y_2 + y_0 x_2 + x_0 y_1 - y_0 x_1)$$ The amazing thing is that $A$ is positive if the three points are
taken in a counter-clockwise orientation, and negative otherwise. To be inside a rectangle (or any convex body), as you trace
around in a clockwise direction from $p_1$ to $p_2$ to $p_3$ to $p_4$ and
back to $p_1$ , the ""areas"" of triangles $p_1 p_2 p$ , $p_2 p_3 p$ , $p_3 p_4 p$ ,

58413,Wald's definition of parallel transport,"I was unsure whether to ask this here or at a physics SE. Wald's ""General Relativity"" defines parallel transport as follows: $\nabla$ is a derivative operator (is linear, obeys Leibniz rule, commutative with contraction, torsion free and is consistent with the notion of vectors as directional derivatives). A vector $v^b$ given at each point of a curve C is parallel transported is said to be parallelly transported as one moves along the curve if the equation $t^a \nabla _a v^b =0$ is satisfied along the curve, where $t^a$ are vectors tangent to the curve. How does this definition reproduce what we intuitively understand as parallel transport? Also, other references use different terminology, with a $\nabla _v$ meaning the derivative along a vector $v$, (the same role $t^a$ plays in the definition above) which is easier to understand but (1) seems ill defined, unlike wald's definition, and (2) both definitions should be related in some way.",['differential-geometry']
58416,How to see that the inverse limit and group completion are isomorphic?,"I'm having a bit of a hard time understanding a proof from Lang on why the completion and the inverse limit $\displaystyle \lim_{\longleftarrow}\ G/H_r$ are isomorphic. Here $\{H_r\}$ is a sequence of normal subgroups in $G$ with $H_r\supset H_{r+1}$ for all $r$ . Theorem 10.1 The completion and the inverse limit $\displaystyle \lim_{\longleftarrow}\ G/H_r$ are isomorphic under natural mappings. Proof. We give the maps. Let $x=\{x_n\}$ be a Cauchy sequence. Given $r$ , for all $n$ sufficiently large, by the definition of Cauchy sequence, the class of $x_n\mod H_r$ is independent of $n$ . Let this class be $x(r)$ . Then the sequence $(x(1),x(2),\dots)$ defines an element of the inverse limit. Conversely, given an element $(\bar{x_1},\bar{x_2},\dots)$ of the inverse limit, with $\bar{x_n}\in G/H_n$ , let $x_n$ be a representative in $G$ . Then the sequence $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy. We leave to the reader to verify that the maps we have defined are inverse isomorphisms between the completion and the inverse limit. I want to see if I'm understanding this correctly (unlikely). So $x(r)$ is the class of all elements $y\in G$ such that $x_ny^{-1}\in H_r$ ? Then $(x(1),x(2),\dots)$ is an element if the inverse limit as for $n\geq m$ , we can take $f^n_m\colon G/H_n\to G/H_m$ to be the canonical homomorphism such that $\bar{x_n}$ in $G/H_n$ maps to $\bar{x_n}=\bar{x_m}$ in $G/H_m$ since $H_m\supset H_n$ ? Also, to see that $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy from $(\bar{x_1},\bar{x_2},\dots)$ , I know that $f^n_m(\bar{x_n})=\bar{x_m}$ by definition of the inverse limit, so $\bar{x_n}=\bar{x_m}$ in $G/H_m$ , so $\overline{x_nx_m^{-1}}=\bar{e}\in G/H_m$ , so $x_nx_m^{-1}\in H_m$ . Then given any $H_r$ , for $n,m\geq r$ , $x_nx_m^{-1}\in H_m\subset H_r$ , and $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy? But then how exactly are the two maps inverses? I didn't quite understand the maps since Lang seems to map a Cauchy sequences $\{x_n\}$ to an element of the inverse limit, but the completion consists of equivalence classes mod the null sequences, so actual Cauchy sequences aren't even elements of the completion $C/C_0$ ?

58467,A question on closed convex plane curves (from Do Carmo),"Let $\alpha (s)$ , $s\in [0,l]$, be a closed convex plane curve positively oriented.
The curve $\beta(s)=\alpha (s) -rn(s)$, where $r$ is a positive constant and $n(s)$ is the normal vector, is called a parallel curve to $\alpha$.
Show that: $$ \text{Length}(\beta)=\text{Length}(\alpha) +2\pi r$$ $$ A(\beta)=A(\alpha)+rl+\pi r^2$$ $$k_{\beta}(s)=\frac{k_{\alpha}(s)}{1+r}$$ where the $k$'s are the curvatures of the corresponding curves. For 1, I used the equation 
$$L(\beta)=\int_{0}^{l} \|\beta'(s)\| ds = \int_{0}^{l} (\|(1+rk_{\alpha})\alpha'(s) \| +\tau r |b(s)|) ds =L(\alpha) (1+rk)+r\tau$$ I don't see how from this I arrive at equation 1. For 2, in this case it's the area enclosed by the curve, not sure what formulas to use here. Any hints? For 3, I calculated according to the definition of the curvature, where $$k_{\beta}(s)=\frac{\|\gamma '(s)\|}{\|\beta '(s) \|}$$ where $\gamma (s)=\frac{\beta '(s)}{\|\beta '(s)\|}$. One of my assumptions is that we're in arclength representation, so $k_{\alpha}(s)=\|\alpha ''(s) \|$.
But I didn't arrive at the same equation, on the contrary it looks like a messy calculation that leads to nowhere.
I got that $$\gamma '(s)= \frac{r^2[r\tau ^2 k'_{\alpha}-(1+rk_{\alpha})\tau \tau ']\alpha '(s)+[(1+rk)k+r\tau ^2][(1+rk)^2+(r\tau)^2] n(s) +r\tau '(1+rk)^2 b(s)}{[(1+rk)^2+(r\tau)^2]^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$

58533,What are the explanations for certain steps in these proofs for the irrationality/rationality of certain numbers?,"From Stephen Abbott's Understanding Analysis : Theorem: There is no rational number whose square is 2. Proof: Assume for contradiction, that there exist integers $p$ and $q$ satisfying (1) $\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^2 = 2$. We may also assume that $p$ and $q$ have no common factor, because, if they had one, we could simply cancel it out and rewrite the fraction in lowest terms. Now, equation (1) implies (2) $p^2 = 2q^2$. From this we can see that the integer $p^2$ is an even number (it is divisible by 2), and hence $p$ must be even as well because the square of an odd number is odd. This allows us to write $p=2r$, where $r$ is also an integer. If we substitute $2r$ for $p$ in equation (2), then a little algebra yields the relationship $2r^2=q^2$. This last equation implies that $q^2$ is even, and hence $q$ must also be even. Thus, we have shown that $p$ and $q$ are both even (i.e., divisible by $2$) when they were originally assumed to have no common factor. From this logical impasse, we can only conclude that equation (1) cannot hold for any integers $p$ and $q$, and thus the theorem is proved. Exercise: (a) Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational. Does a similar argument work to show that $\sqrt{6}$ is irrational? (b) Where does the proof of the irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$ break down if we try to use it to prove $\sqrt{4}$ is irrational? Solution: (a) Assume, for contradiction, that there exist integers $p$ and $q$ satisfying (1) $\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^2 = 3$. Let us also assume that $p$ and $q$ have no common factor. Now, equation (1) implies (2) $p^2 = 3q^2$. From this, we can see that $p^2$ is a multiple of $3$ and hence $p$ must also be a multiple of $3$. This allows us to write $p = 3r$, where $r$ is an integer. After substituting $3r$ for $p$ in equation (2), we get $(3r)^2 = 3q^2$, which can be simplified to $3r^2=q^2$. This implies $q^2$ is a multiple of $3$ and hence $q$ is also a multiple of $3$. Thus we have shown $p$ and $q$ have a common factor, namely $3$, when they were originally assumed to have no common factor.
  A similar argument will work for $\sqrt{6}$ as well because we get $p^2 = 6q^2$ which implies $p$ is a multiple of $2$ and $3$. After making the necessary substitutions, we can conclude $q$ is a multiple of $6$, and therefore $\sqrt{6}$ must be irrational. (b) In this case, the fact that $p^2$ is a multiple of $4$ does not imply $p$ is also a multiple of $4$. Thus, our proof breaks down at this point. Question(s): Could somebody please help and spell out for me some of the theorems which are being used along the way in the arguments above? Since the theorem quoted above is the first theorem in the book, I am not exactly sure what is assumed to be common knowledge or whatever... For $\sqrt{3}$, what exactly is being used to justify ""$p^2$ is a multiple of $3$ and hence $p$ must also be a multiple of $3$""? I've seen some other proofs for this which have to do with even and odd numbers, but the one above has to do specifically with $3$, right? For $\sqrt{6}$, why is it important to say ""$p^2 = 6q^2$ implies $p$ is a multiple of $2$ and $3$"" instead of ""is a multiple of $6$""? For $\sqrt{4}$, why is it so clear that ""the fact that $p^2$ is a multiple of $4$ does not imply $p$ is also a multiple of $4$""? I know I can think of a counterexample like $p=2 \Rightarrow p^2=4$ and $4$ is divisible by $4$, but $2$ is not. But what is the pattern to notice? Any help is appreciated.

58548,Why are infinitely dimensional vector spaces not isomorphic to their duals?,"Assuming the axiom of choice, set $\mathbb F$ to be some field (we can assume it has characteristics $0$). I was told, by more than one person, that if $\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal then the vector space $V=\mathbb F^{(\kappa)}$ (that is an infinitely dimensional space with basis of cardinality $\kappa$) is not isomorphic (as a vector space) to the algebraic dual, $V^*$. I have asked several professors in my department, and this seems to be completely folklore. I was directed to some book, but could not have find it in there as well. The Wikipedia entry tells me that this is indeed not a cardinality issue, for example $\mathbb R^{<\omega}$ (that is all the eventually zero sequences of real numbers) has the same cardinality as its dual $\mathbb R^\omega$ but they are not isomorphic. Of course being of the same cardinality is necessary but far from sufficient for two vector spaces to be isomorphic. What I am asking, really, is whether or not it is possible when given a basis and an embedding of a basis of $V$ into $V^*$, to say "" This guy is not in the span of the embedding""? Edit: I read the answers in the link given by Qiaochu. They did not satisfy me too much. My main problem is this: suppose $\kappa$ is our basis then $V$ consists of $\{f\colon\kappa\to\mathbb F\Big| |f^{-1}[\mathbb F\setminus\{0\}]|<\infty\}$ (that is finite support), while $V^*=\{f\colon\kappa\to\mathbb F\}$ (that is all the functions). In particular, the basis for $V$ is given by $f_\alpha(x) = \delta_{\alpha x}$ (i.e. $1$ on $\alpha$, and $0$ elsewhere), while $V^*$ needs a much larger basis. Why can't there by other linear functionals on $V$? Edit II: After the discussions in the comments and the answers, I have a better understanding of my question to begin with. I have no qualms that under the axiom of choice given an infinite set $\kappa$ there are a lot more functions from $\kappa$ into $\mathbb F$, than functions with finite support from $\kappa$ into $\mathbb F$. It is also clear to me that the basis of a vector space is actually the set of $\delta$ functions, whereas the basis for the dual is a subset of characteristic functions. My problem is, if so, why is the dual space composed from all functions from $A$ into $F$? (And if possible, not to just show by cardinality games that the basis is much larger but actually show the algorithm for the diagonalization.)","['vector-spaces', 'dual-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

58565,Is there a constructive proof of this characterization of $\ell^2$?,"I would like to revisit this question , which can be equivalently stated as: Proposition .  Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence of real (or complex) numbers such that $\sum a_n b_n$ converges for every $(b_n) \in \ell^2$.  Then $(a_n) \in \ell^2$. The proof given here by Bruno Stonek is the only one I know, which applies the uniform boundedness principle to the linear functionals $(b_n) \mapsto \sum_{n=1}^m a_n b_n$ in $(\ell^2)^*$.  But I am inclined to agree with GEdgar's comment on Davide Giraudo's answer that this approach, though slick, is ""far too advanced"". One could write the contrapositive as: Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence of real numbers which is not $\ell^2$.  Then there exists $(b_n) \in \ell^2$ such that $\sum a_n b_n$ diverges. A natural way to try to prove that statement would be to explicitly construct such a $(b_n)$, by somehow manipulating $(a_n)$.  Our current proof is far from constructive in that sense, since the uniform boundedness principle essentially just says that the set of such $(b_n)$ is comeager in the Hilbert space $\ell^2$, and then uses Baire to assert it is nonempty. So my question: Can anyone think of a way to explicitly construct $(b_n)$?  Or alternatively, is there some reason to think that such a construction might be impossible? For instance, as a wild guess, perhaps one could show that any map sending each $(a_n) \notin \ell^2$ to an appropriate $(b_n)$ would have to be nonmeasurable in some sense.","['hilbert-spaces', 'sequences-and-series', 'functional-analysis']"

58583,"If $X$ is inductive, then the set $\{ x\in X : x$ is transitive}  is inductive. Hence every $n\in N$ is transitive","First some definitions: 
$X$ is inductive if $\emptyset\in X$ and $x\in X\implies x\cup\{x\}\in X$ Let $N = \cap\{X : X \text{ is inductive }\}$. 
Let us use the following notation: $0 = \emptyset$, $1 = \{0\}$, $2 = \{0 , 1\}$, ... if $n\in N$ let $n + 1 = n \cup \{n\}$. Let us define $<$ (on $N$) by $n < m$ iff $n\in m$. A set $T$ is transitive if $x\in T$ implies $x\subset T$. Then I have : If $X$ is inductive, then the set $\{ x\in X : x$ is transitive} is inductive. Hence every $n\in N$ is transitive. Solution. Suppose $X$ is inductive, it follows that $\emptyset\in X$. The empty set is also vacuously transitive, hence $\emptyset\in \{ x\in X : x$ is transitive}. Now suppose that $x\in\{ x\in X : x$ is transitive} it follows that $x\in X$ and hence $x\cup\{x\} \in X$. Similarly it follows that $x$ is transitive. Now, let $a\in x\cup\{x\}$, then there are two cases either $a\in x$ or $a\in \{x\}$. In the first case it follows that since $a\in x$ and $x$ is transitive $a\subset x$, and hence $a\subset x\cup\{x\}$. In the second case since $a\in\{x\}$ and $\{x\}$ is a singleton set it follows that $a = x$, thus $a \subset x\cup\{x\}$. Thus $x\cup\{x\}$ is transitive, and hence $x\cup\{x\} \in\{ x\in X : x$ is transitive}. Therefore we can conclude that $\{ x\in X : x$ is transitive} is inductive. $\Box$ Now the problem, I really cannot see how the corollary ""Hence every $n\in N$ is transitive."" follows from this. But I do note that I know $N$ is transitive, and for each $n\in N$, $n = \{m\in N : m < n\}$ by the previous question. So I was wondering if someone could help shed light on how the corollary follows from the initial question, or point out the flaw in my proof thus suggesting a reason it doesn't currently follow.

Routinely, we define a dual operator $U^n$ related to $P^n$ as follows: $$ U^n f(x) = \int\limits_{X} f(y)P^n(x,dy) ,$$ for any $f\in C(X)$. We also assume that $P$ has the Feller property; that means that $Uf \in C(X)$ for $f\in C(X)$. I know three different definitions of so-called e-property and I wonder about the relationships between them. (i) for all $f\in C(X)$ with bounded support the family $\{U^n f: n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is uniformly equicontinuous on each compact subset of $X$, (ii) for all $f\in C(X)$ with bounded support the family $\{U^n f: n\in\mathbb{N}\}$  is equicontinuous in each point of $X$. (iii) for all Lipschitz functions $f \in C(X)$ with bounded support the family $\{U^n f: n\in\mathbb{N}\}$  is equicontinuous in each point of $X$. I've proved that (ii) $\Rightarrow$ (i), the implication (ii) $\Rightarrow$ (iii) is obvious. I think that the implication (i) $\Rightarrow$ (ii) is true only when $X$ is additionally locally compact, am I right or may be it is more general?

At time t=n , the circle is at (0, s n ) with radius r+b n . As the circle moves and expands, it sweeps a shape. What is the formula for the shape swept by the circle in a given amount of time N? It occurs to me that there are two cases. First, when s <= b , the motion of the circle is overshadowed by the expansion, and the final shape ends up being a circle at (0, s N ) with radius r+b N . But when s > b , the expansion can't keep up with the motion, and it sweeps a shape through space. It appears to me that the exact shape is that of both circles connected by line segments tangent to both, like two pulleys with a belt. This related question says that it's called the convex hull of two circles. The questioner wants to know how to determine whether a point is within the convex hull.

If we consider the equation $x^tAx=\lambda$, for $\lambda \in K$, what are the criteria for the existance of solution and simple methods to solve it?","['algebraic-k-theory', 'quadratic-forms', 'linear-algebra', 'number-theory']"
58951,Comparison between Rademacher average and random average,"Let $X$ be a Banach space. We let $j=e^{2i\pi/3}$.
Let $(\epsilon_i)$ be a sequence of independent Rademacher variables on a fixed probability space $\Omega$. Let $(\varphi_i)$ be a sequence of independent complex random variables such that $P(\varphi_i=1)=\frac{1}{3}$, $P(\varphi_i=j)=\frac{1}{3}$ and $P(\varphi_i=j^2)=\frac{1}{3}$ for any $i$. Do there exist sufficient conditions on $X$ such that there exist constants $m,M>0$ such that
$$
m\Big\vert\Big\vert\sum_i \epsilon_i\otimes x_i \Big\vert\Big\vert_{L^p(\Omega,X)}\leq \Big\vert\Big\vert\sum_i \varphi_i \otimes x_i \Big\vert\Big\vert_{L^p(\Omega,X)}\leq M\Big\vert\Big\vert\sum_i \epsilon_i\otimes x_i \Big\vert\Big\vert_{L^p(\Omega,X)}

58961,Stalks of the graph of a morphism,"I am interested in the graph $\Gamma_f$ of a morphism $f: X\rightarrow Y$ between two sufficiently nice schemes $X,Y$. One knows that it is a closed subset of $X\times Y$ (when the schemes are nice, say varieties over a field). I would like to know the following: if you endow it with the reduced structure, what are the stalks of it's structure sheaf in a point $(x,f(x))$ ? Thanks you very much!","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

59003,Can one avoid AC in the proof that in Noetherian rings there is a maximal element for each set?,"More specifically, I just want to prove that in a Noetherian (even Dedekind) ring, every ideal in contained in a maximal ideal. Is the axiom oh choice needed here? The usual proofs (for general rings use Zorn's lemma; for Noetherian rings one can build an infinite ascending chain if there is no maximal element) seem to rely on it. If the axiom of dependent choice can be avoided as well, even better.","['abstract-algebra', 'axiom-of-choice']"
59007,"How can I calculate $a$, $f$, $x_0$ and $y_0$ in $y = a \cos(f(x - x_0)) + y_0$ given four arbitrary points?","How can I calculate $a$, $f$, $x_0$ and $y_0$ in $y = a \cos(f(x - x_0)) + y_0$, given four arbitrary points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, … that the graph must go though? The complexity of substituting each $x_n$ for $x$ and $y_n$ for $y$, solving for a variable and substituting back in to the original equation becomes impossible.  Every variable I substitute carries the rest of the variables in its solution. I'm getting the idea that I'm going to have to use an iterative method, but even there I don't know how I would do it since each variable depends on the definition of all the rest, and this is a transcendental equation.",['trigonometry']
