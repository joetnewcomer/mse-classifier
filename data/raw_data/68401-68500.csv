821881,"Riemann Zeta function, quaternions and physics","Disclaimer: This question is rather vague, and thus probably not suitable for Mathoverflow, so I prefer to ask it here. I'm sorry if it doesn't meet the standards of this site. Several years ago, I tried to define a notion of ""hyperholomorphy"" for functions of the quaternionic variable and, as I wrote down the equivalent of the Cauchy Riemann equations for such ""hyperholomorphic"" functions, I obtained a matrix that, when multiplied on the left by the metric tensor of special relativity (that is, passing from an euclidean metric to a lorentzian one), provided a wave equation and a continuity equation, suggesting a strong connexion between those ""hyperholomorphic"" functions and physics. I would like to know if, defining the Riemann Zeta function on quaternions and then using this ""metrick"" (multiplying by the metric tensor of special relativity), one could obtain some kind of an explanation of the famous observation of Dyson that the formula in Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the Riemann Zeta function was the same as the pair correlation function of random Hermitian matrices. For example, can the vertical distribution of the Riemann zeros under RH be shown to be invariant under the application of the considered ""metrick""? Once again, I apologize for the vagueness of the question, but it would be great if someone could use it to get interesting results about the connexion between number theory and physics. Thanks in advance. Edit: writing the analogue of the Cauchy-Riemann conditions for a quaternionic function $P(q)+iQ(q)+jR(q)+kS(q)$ defined for a quaternion $q=(t, x, y, z)$ gives
$(\partial_{t}+i\partial_{x}+j\partial_{y}+k\partial_{z})(P+iQ+jR+kS)=0$ hence the ""hyper-Cauchy-Riemann"" matrix is: $M=\begin{pmatrix}
   \partial_{t} & -\partial_{x} & -\partial_{y} & -\partial_{z} \\
   \partial_{x} & \partial_{t} & -\partial_{z} & \partial_{y} \\
   \partial_{y} & \partial_{z} & \partial_{t} & -\partial_{x} \\
   \partial_{z} & -\partial_{y} & \partial_{x} & \partial_{t} \\
\end{pmatrix}$ so that $M.\begin{pmatrix}
   P \\
   Q \\
   R \\
   S \\ 
\end{pmatrix}=0$. Multiplying on the left by the transpose of $^{4}\nabla=\begin{pmatrix}
   \partial_{t} \\
   \partial_{x} \\
   \partial_{y} \\
   \partial_{z} \\
\end{pmatrix}$ and then the transpose of the resulting matrix on the left by $\begin{pmatrix}
   -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}$ gives $\partial_{t}^{2}=\nabla^{2}$ and $\partial_{x}+\partial_{y}+\partial_{z}=0$, hence the wave equation and the continuity equation. The fact that multiplying the matrix $M$ on the left by $\begin{pmatrix}
   -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}$ (that is, the application of the ""metrick"") yields the same matrix with the opposite signs of the coefficients of the first row shows that any hyperholomorphic function defined on an euclidean 4-manifold remains hyperholomorphic when defined on the correspondent lorentzian 4-manifold. This is thus an invariant property when one passes from the purely mathematical realm to the physical one. The key idea is to show that this holds true for the vertical distribution of the Riemann zeros, those ones having to be the mathematical equivalent (i.e on the euclidean side) of the energy levels of an atom (on the lorentzian side).","['riemann-zeta', 'number-theory', 'mathematical-physics', 'quaternions', 'soft-question']"
821886,Finding the maximum value of $\displaystyle \frac{x^n-a\sin x}{x^{n+1}}\ (x\gt 0)$,"For $a\ge 1\in\mathbb R,n\ge 1\in\mathbb N$, let us define $f(x)$ as $$f(x)=\frac{x^n-a\sin x}{x^{n+1}}\ \ \ (x\gt 0).$$
Also, let $M(a,n)$ be the maximum value of $f(x).$ We may be able to know the approximate value of $M(a,n)$ using some tools, but... Question 1 : Can we represent $M(a,n)$ by $a,n$? Since Question 1 seems very difficult for me, I've been trying to find the explicit value of $M(a,n)$ for smaller $(a,n)$. However, even proving that $M(1,1)=1/\pi$ for $x=\pi$ was not very easy for me. So... Question 2 : For what $(a,n)\not=(1,1)$ can we find the explicit value of $M(a,n)$?

821959,Derivable doesn't exist in english?,"I have a question about terminology. See this is what happens: someone says ""this function is derivable"", and then another, more experienced Anglo-Saxon mathematician goes on to correct this someone, saying that the term is ""differentiable"". Or at least in my experience. However, in Spanish (and other romance languages I believe), the situation would be: ""this function is derivable"", then the more experienced, romantic-language mathematician goes ""yes, but that doesn't make it differentiable"". This is because, in Spanish, the term derivable means just that, the directional derivatives all exist, they just may not be a linear map of the direction. For example, in 1D ""derivable"" and ""differentiable"" would be the same thing (in fact this is a common stress point in lessons, how ""it's not the same in higher dimensions!""). Furthermore, in 1-var. calculus I was urged to use the term ""derivable"", as opposed to ""differentiable"", so as to not gain a false understanding of the meaning of differentiability. Call it a trifle, but I've really been wondering about this for my whole math education (and other things about real math, not to worry). So I ask if there is an analogue to ""derivable"" in English or if you have to work up a long phrase every time.","['terminology', 'derivatives']"

When : (a) $Ker ~\Psi= S_3 \rightarrow$ then this is the trivial homomorphism with all mappings converging to identity. There is one homomorphism in this case (b) $Ker ~\Psi= (1) \rightarrow \Psi(x) = y \implies$ then $O(y)$ must divide $O(x)$. Hence, $(123)$ can get mapped only to $(132)$ or $(123)$. $(12), (13) ,(23)$ can be mapped among themselves in $3! = 6$ ways. Hence $6 .2 =12$ homomorphisms are possiblie in this case (c) $Ker ~\Psi=(\langle 123 \rangle) \rightarrow$  now $(\langle 123 \rangle) = \{ (1), (123),(132) \}$ . All elements in this set get mapped to $(1)$ in just $1$ way. We have to think of how the other elements get mapped in this case, the image of $\Psi$ is a subgroup of order $2$ since $S_3/ Ker~\Psi \approx \Psi(S_3) \implies |\Psi (S_3)| = 2$ $ \implies \Psi (S_3) = \{1, (12)\}$ or $\{1,(13)\}$ or $\{1,(23)\}$ There are $3$ possible homomorphisms in this case Hence total number of homomorphisms possible = $16$.

822284,(Ito lemma proof): convergence of $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(W(t_{i}))(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i}))^{2}.$,"The purpose of this question is to complete my personal exposition on the rigorous proof of Ito's lemma.  I have consulted more than half a dozen mathematical finance texts and not a single one, for all its importance, rigorously proves this.  The closest I've seen is Shreve's treatment in Stochastic Calculus for Finance Vol II Let $\{W(t)\}_{t\geq0}$ be a standard Brownian motion.  Let $f$ be a smooth function, $T>0$, and $\Pi=\{t_{0}=0,t_{1},\ldots,t_{n}=T\}$ be a partition of $[0,T]$. Consider the random variable
$$X(\omega)=\lim_{||\Pi||\to0}\;\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(W(t_{i}))(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i}))^{2}.$$ If $f\equiv1$, then almost surely $X\equiv T$.  This is the standard result that Brownian motion accumulates quadratic variation at a unit rate. If we make the substitution $(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i}))^{2}\approx(t_{i+1}-t_{i})$, then after $||\Pi||\to0$ and summing, the errors committed with this approximation go to $0$ and we recover almost surely
$$X\equiv \int_{0}^{T}f(W(s))\;ds.$$ Is there a way to make this more precise?  I would like to adapt the usual proof that $$\lim_{||\Pi||\to0}\;\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i}))^{2}=T,$$
which proceeds by showing that the expectation of the sampled quadratic variation (i.e. the sum on any partition) is $T$ and that the variance tends to $0$ as the partition becomes finer.  Indeed, $$\mathbb{E}[(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i}))^{2}]=\text{Var}[W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i})]=t_{i+1}-t_{i}$$ and $$\text{Var}[(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i}))^{2}]=2(t_{i+1}-t_{i})^{2}$$ and the claim follows after summing, taking limits, and performing a simple estimate on the variance.  Based on my efforts, it does not seem like such simple formulas hold for the expectation and variance when the quantity is multiplied by $f(W(t_{i})).$ A heuristic for the approximation above can be obtained by noting that (if $\Pi$ is a uniformly spaced partition) $$(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i}))^{2}=\frac{T}{n}\left(\frac{W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i})}{\sqrt{t_{i+1}-t_{i}}}\right)^{2}.$$ Thus if
$$Y_{i}:=\left(\frac{W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i})}{\sqrt{t_{i+1}-t_{i}}}\right)^{2},$$
then (being a collection of squared normal iid random variables with mean $1$) the law of large numbers implies
$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i}))^{2}=T\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{Y_{i+1}}{n}\to T\;\text{as}\;n\to\infty.$$
Thus, while $(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i}))^{2}\neq t_{i+1}-t_{i}$, the law of large numbers says that the error committed with this approximation cancels out in the limit.  In other words, we may write
$$(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i}))^{2}=(t_{i+1}-t_{i})+\phi(t_{i})$$
where $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\phi(t_{i}))\to0\;\text{as}\;n\to\infty.$  What I'm trying to rigorously establish is that the above equations/limits all remain valid if we multiply them by $f(W(t_{i}))$. In other words, is it correct to write $$f(W(t_{i}))(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i}))^{2}=f(W(t_{i}))(t_{i+1}-t_{i})+\phi(t_{i}))$$ where $\sum_{i=0}^{n}f(W(t_{i}))\phi(t_{i})\to0\;\text{as}\;n\to\infty?$ The obvious problem with the above heuristic is that the random variables
$$Y_{i}':=f(W(t_{i}))Y_{i}:=f(W(t_{i}))\left(\frac{W(t_{i+1})-W(t_{i})}{\sqrt{t_{i+1}-t_{i}}}\right)^{2}$$
are no longer independent, so the law of large numbers cannot be used in the manner above.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-calculus', 'probability', 'brownian-motion']"

822362,Prove the existence (or well-definedness) of the induced connection in tensor bundle,"Given a connection $\nabla$ on a vector bundle $E$ over a smooth manifold $M$, we know there is a unique extension of $\nabla$ to all tensor bundles of $E$ that satisfies Leibniz rule and contraction. I am going to prove this. We can first define the connection on the dual space of $E$ using the formula forced by the axioms above. Then the rest is essentially just proving one lemma: Given two bundles $E$, $F$ on $M$ and connections on $E$ and $F$, both denoted by $\nabla$, then there is a unique connection $\nabla$ on $E\otimes F$ such that 
$$\nabla_X(s_E\otimes s_F)=\nabla_X s_E\otimes s_F+s_E\otimes \nabla_X s_F$$ I tried to invoke the universal property of tensor product as usual, to use bilinearity to prove well-definedness. However this tensor product of sections is not the strict tensor product in linear algebra tense (it takes tensor product pointwise, and it cannot be understood as a tensor product of two $\mathbb R$-vector spaces. It can be tensor product of $C^\infty(M)$ modules though, but $\nabla_X$ is not $C^\infty$ linear). So I get in problem here, and I ask for a conceptual way to show why $\nabla_X$ is a well defined map from the space of sections of $E\otimes F$ to itself.","['connections', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds']"

822419,Question about Differentials,"I am reading the book ""Advanced Calculus"" written by Kaplan, and here is what I have: Suppose that $y(x)$ is a differentiable function at $x = x_0$ . Then, we can write $y(x_0+\Delta x) = y(x_0) + y'(x_0)\cdot \Delta x + \epsilon\cdot \Delta x, \, where \, \epsilon \rightarrow 0  \:  as \, \Delta x \rightarrow 0$ . We denote the differential of $y$ by $dy = y'(x_0)\cdot\Delta x$ . Now note that if $g(x) = x$ , then $g$ is clearly differentiable at $x = x_0$ , so we have $dg = dx = 1\cdot\Delta x$ , from which it follows that $dy =   y'(x_0)\cdot\Delta x=  y'(x_0)\cdot dx$ Also, if $y'(x_0) \neq 0 $ , we can write $dx = \dfrac{1}{y'(x_0)}dy$ I am uncomfortable with the last line $dx = \dfrac{1}{y'(x_0)}dy$ because I think that in order for this expression to be ""meaningful"", it must be true that x can be written as a function of y, and this function must be differentiable at $y = f(x_0)$ . But, as far as I know, mere existence of nonzero derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=x_0$ does not imply the invertibility of y(x), let alone its differentiability. To illustrate my point, say, for instance, that we have $y(2) = 1$ and $y'(2)= 3$ so that $dy = 3dx$ Then, according to Kaplan, we can write $dx = \dfrac{1}{3}dy$ .
But then, if somone else sees only $dx = \dfrac{1}{3}dy$ at $(x,y) = (1,2)$ , then he/she would think that x is a function of y with $x(1) = 2$ and $x'(1) = \dfrac{1}{3}$ . But, the fact that $y(2) = 1$ and $y'(2) = 3$ does not imply $x(1) = 2$ and $x'(1) = \dfrac{1}{3}$ . Right? How can you freely move around $dy$ and $dx$ as if it does not matter which variable is an independent varible?","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
822421,A sphere is homeomorphic to a cylinder where the top and bottom bases are identified to single points.,"Let $\sim$ denote the equivalence relation on the cylinder $S^1 \times [-1, 1]$ defined by $(v,-1) \sim (v',-1)$ for all $v, v' \in S^1$, and $(v, 1) \sim (v', 1)$ for all $v, v' \in S^1$. Here $S^1$ is the unit circle $\{(x, y) \in \Bbb{R}^2 | x^2 + y^2 = 1\}$. Prove that the quotient space $S^1 \times [-1, 1]/\sim$ is homeomorphic to the unit sphere
  $S^2 = \{(x, y, z) \in \Bbb{R}^3| x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1\}$. State carefully results about homeomorphisms and the quotient topology that you use in your proof. Let $X = S^1 \times [-1,1]$ and $Y = S^2$, where $S^2$ is the sphere centered at the origin with radius $1$. Define $f: X \rightarrow Y$ by homeomorphically mapping each circle $S^1 \times \{t\}$ for $t \in (-1,1)$ to the correspoding circle in $S^2$ at $z = t$. Map $S^1 \times \{1\}$ and $S^1 \times \{-1\}$ to the top and bottom points on the sphere respectively. Obviously, $f$ is both surjective and continuous. Since both $S^1$ and $[-1,1]$ are compact, so is there product $S^1 \times [-1,1]$. Since $S^2$ is a subspace of a Hausdorff space, it must also be Hausdorff. This tells us that $f$ must be closed, implying that $f$ is a quotient map. 
Since $f$ is a quotient map, the map $\bar{f}: X/\sim \rightarrow Y$ (induced by $f$) is a homeomorphism as it is an injective quotient map. I was wondering if there was a more explicit way of showing that $f$ is surjective and continuous.

My idea is to substitute cube roots of unity in binomial expansion of $(1+x)^{3m}$. But, how do I get the additional divisibility by $3^{m-1}$? Perhaps we can use some variation of $\displaystyle \binom{3m}{3k} \equiv \binom{m}{k} \pmod {3^{2+2\operatorname{ord}_3 m}}$, or induction on $m$ henceforth. ($\operatorname{ord_{3}}n$ is the heighest power of $3$ in $n$). Edit: I add my approach (induction on $m$) We have the identity $$(1+x)^{3m}+(1+\omega x)^{3m}+(1+\omega^2 x)^{3m} = 3\sum\limits_{k=1}^{m}\binom{3m}{3k}x^{3k}$$ Let, $\omega_1 = 1+x$, $\omega_2 = 1+\omega x$ and $\omega_3 = 1+\omega^2 x$, then $\omega_i$ are the roots of $P(t) = t^3 - 3t^2 + 3t -(1+x^3)$. Denoting, $S_k = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{3}\omega_j^k$, then it satisfies the recurssion: $S_{k+3} - 3S_{k+2} + 3S_{k+1}-(1+x^3)S_k = 0, \forall \, x \in \mathbb{N}$ Setting $x = \sqrt[3]{3n-1} \implies x^3+1 = 3n$. The recurssion becomes $S_{k+3} = 3S_{k+2} - 3S_{k+1} + 3nS_k$. A small calculation shows $S_{k+7}= 63nS_{k+2} + 9(n^2-3n+3)S_{k+1} + 27n(2n+1)S_k$. Where, $S_{2+1} = 9n$, so it follows from induaction that $3^{2k+2}n \mid S_{6k+3}$, i.e. $3^{m+1}n \mid S_{3m}$, where $m=2k+1$.

Is the union $\bigcup_{i=1}^k A_i$ triangulable$^1$? If so, why? Background: I'm trying to better understand the Nerve Theorem from Topology. In his Book Computational Topology (p.71) Edelsbrunner presents the following Nerve theorem without giving a proof: Let F be a finite collection of closed, convex sets in Euclidean Space. Then the nerve$^2$ of $F$ is homotopy equivalent to $\bigcup F$. He also mentions the following classical nerve theorem, which one can find in Topological methods (p.1850) , and which is supposed to be more general: Let $X$ be a triangulable space and let
  $\mathcal{A} = \{A_1, \ldots, A_k\}$ be a finite closed cover$^3$ of $X$ such that
   every non-empty intersection of the ${A_i}'s$ is contractible. Then the nerve of $\mathcal{A}$ is homotopy equivalent to $X$. So does the former follow from the later? $^1$ A space is called triangulable if it is homeomorphic to some simplicial complex. $^2$ The nerve of a collection $F$ of sets is the abstract simplicial complex $\{Y \subseteq F : \bigcap Y \neq \emptyset\}$. $^3$ A closed cover is a covering by closed subset of a topological space.","['general-topology', 'convex-analysis', 'computational-mathematics']"

822845,Understanding of Brownian Motion,"My background is functional analysis rather than probability, but I would like to understand what is a Brownian motion. Below I'm giving my current understanding, can anyone verify whether I'm correct. Thank you. Canonical Brownian motion $\mathbf{B}$ is a space $C([0, \infty), \mathbb{R}^n)$ equipped with a certain probability measure. 
We can write it as $\mathbf{B}= (B_t)_{t \geq 0}$, where $B_t ( f ) = f(t)$, for all $f \in C([0, \infty), \mathbb{R}^n)$. 
Measure is given by 
$$P \big( \bigcap_{j=1}^{k} B_{t_j}^{-1}(F_j) \big) = \int_{F_1 \times \ldots \times F_k}  p(t_1, x, x_1) \ldots p(t_k - t_{k-1}, x_{k-1}, x_k) \mathrm{d}x_1\ldots \mathrm{d} x_k,$$
where $$ p(t,x,y) = (2\pi t)^{-\frac{n}{2}}\exp\big( - \frac{| x- y|^2}{2t}\big)$$ for $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and it is defined on a $\sigma-$field $\sigma( \{ B_t \colon t \geq 0\})$.
From this definition we can conclude that $B_t$ is a Gaussian process, that is, that for all $0 \leq t_1 \leq \ldots \leq t_k$ the random variable $(B_{t_1}, \ldots, B_{t_k}) \in \mathbb{R}^{nk}$ has a normal distribution. $B_t$ has independent increments, and $t \mapsto B_t(f) = f(t)$ is continuous and hence show that canonical Brownian motion has properties which define usual Brownian motion - as a Wiener process.","['stochastic-processes', 'functional-analysis', 'brownian-motion']"

823045,Galois group of the quintic polynomial $X^5+X+1$,"I'm trying to find the Galois group of the polynomial $p(X)= X^5+X+1$ over $\mathbb Q$. First, one notes that, if $\omega$ is a primitive cubic root of unity, then it is a root of $p(X)$. So, $X^2+X+1$ is a factor of $p(X)$. We have the following factorisation:
\begin{equation}
p(X) = (X^2+X+1)(X^3-X^2+1).
\end{equation}
Now, the derivative of $p(X)$ is $p'(X) = X^4+1$, which is always positive. Hence, $p(X)$ has only one real root, which is a root $\alpha$ of $X^3-X^2+1$. Let me denote by $\eta$ and $\overline{\eta}$ the other two complex roots of $X^3-X^2+1$. Then, a splitting field of $p(X)$ over $\mathbb Q$ is clearly given by
\begin{equation}
K = \mathbb Q(\alpha, \omega, \eta).
\end{equation}
Next, I have to compute the degree $[K : \mathbb Q]$ of the extension. It is simple to prove that $[\mathbb Q(\alpha, \eta) : \mathbb Q] = 6$: in fact, $\mathbb Q(\alpha, \eta)$ is a splitting field of $X^3-X^2+1$ over $\mathbb Q$, and this polynomial has only one real root. So, I try to compute as follows:
\begin{equation}
[K : \mathbb Q] = [K : \mathbb Q(\alpha,\eta)][\mathbb Q(\alpha, \eta) : \mathbb Q].
\end{equation}
Here comes my problem: clearly, the degree $[K : \mathbb Q(\alpha,\eta)]$ is $1$ or $2$. The point is to understand whether $\omega \in \mathbb Q(\alpha, \eta)$ or not, and I'm unable to give an answer. I think that actually $[K : \mathbb Q(\alpha,\eta)] = 2$, and that eventually one can prove that the Galois group $\mathrm{Gal}(K | \mathbb Q)$ is isomorphic to $S_3 \times C_2$.

823643,subsets and sets,"I'm not so bad in math however I want to understand math the way mathematicians do, so I picked up this book How to Think Like a Mathematician . The book seems the book that I'm looking for. Definitely, it gonna be very long dark tunnel to me until I see the light. Any ways, he started with sets and I came across the following 1- For any set $X$, we have $X \subseteq X$. 2- For any set $X$, we have $\emptyset \subseteq X$. I couldn't imagine  what do the two aforementioned statements imply. For the first one, how come a set is part of or equal itself? I can imagine the equality here but not the partition. The second statement, how come a non-empty set has an empty set? For example, let $ X = \{1, 2, 3\}$, now why $\emptyset \subseteq X$?",['elementary-set-theory']
823686,"Finding an efficient estimator for $\theta$ in $U[0, \theta]$ in terms of the sample maximum","This question appeared in a past exam paper, in the form: Let $X = (X_1\dotsc X_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ be an i.i.d. sample from $U[0, \theta], \theta>0$ Apply Rao-Blackwell's theorem to the unbiased estimator $2X_1$ using the statistic $X_{(n)} = \max\{X_i\}$ to compute the efficient estimator for $\theta$. (In other parts of the problem we showed that $X_{(n)}$ is a complete sufficient statistic) My working looks like this: \begin{align}
F_{X_{(n)}}(y)
    &= P(X_{(n)}\leq y)= F_{X_1}(y)^n \\
    &= \left(\frac{y}{\theta}\right)^n\mathbf{1}(0\leq y\leq \theta) 
        + \mathbf{1}(y>\theta)\\
f_{X_{(n)}}(y)
    &= \frac{ny^{n-1}}{\theta^n}\mathbf{1}(0\leq y\leq \theta)\\
F_{(X_{1},X_{(n)})}(x, y)
    &= P(X_1\leq x, X_{(n)}\leq y)\\ 
    &= \left\{
        \begin{array}{cl}
            \theta^{-n}xy^{n-1} & :0\leq x\leq y\leq \theta \\
            \theta^{-n}y^n &: 0\leq y\leq x\leq \theta
        \end{array}
    \right.\\
f{(X_{1},X_{(n)})}(x, y) 
    &= \theta^{-n}(n-1)y^{n-2}\mathbf{1}(0\leq x\leq y\leq \theta)\\
f_{X_{1}|X_{(n)}}(x| y)
    &=\frac{\theta^{-n}(n-1)y^{n-2}}{\theta^{-n}ny^{n-1}}\mathbf{1}(0\leq x\leq y)\\
    &= \frac{n-1}{n}y^{-1}\mathbf{1}(0\leq x\leq y)\\
\mathbf{E}(X_1|X_{(n)}=y)
    &=\frac{n-1}{n}\int_0^y\frac{x}{y}dy \\
    &=\frac{n-1}{n}\frac{y}{2} \\
\mathbf{E}(2X_1|X_{(n)})
    &= \frac{n-1}{n} X_{(n)}
\end{align}
According to Rao-Blackwell's theorem , this should yield an unbiased estimator for $\theta$. Unfortunately, it is not unbiased and also yields an impossible value of $\theta$, since $X_{(n)}<\theta$. Playing around with the result, I found that $\frac{n+1}{n} X_{(n)}$ does the job and makes sense, but I can't figure out where I went wrong in my calculations and would be very grateful if someone could point my error out.","['statistics', 'parameter-estimation', 'conditional-probability']"

[duplicate]","This question already has answers here : How do you prove ${n \choose k}$ is maximum when $k$ is $ \lceil \tfrac n2 \rceil$ or $ \lfloor \tfrac n2\rfloor $? (6 answers) Closed 8 years ago . Prove that the binomial coefficient $\binom {n}{k} = \frac {n!} {(n-k)!k!}$, viewed as a function of $k$, has maximum at $k=\lfloor n/2 \rfloor, \lceil n/2 \rceil$ if $n$ is odd and maximum at $k=n/2$ if $n$ is even. Also how do I see that $\binom {n}{k} = \frac {n!} {(n-k)!k!}$ is increasing on $[0;n/2]$ and decreasing on $[n/2;n]$ ? I see that $\binom {n}{k} = \frac {n!} {(n-k)!k!} = \frac {n!} {(n-(n-k))!(n-k)!} = \binom {n}{n-k}$, so clearly the function is symmetric around $n/2$.

823720,Find maximal possible determinant value given constraint,"Task is to find maximal possible determinant value for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices given following constraint: 
$$\sum_{i,j=1}^na_{ij}^2 \le 1$$ I was able to come up with solution, but I received the test result, where I scored zero for this task. I still hasn't got a chance to take a look at my examined paper, but for now I just want to find whether or not my solution was actually true. Solution First trivial idea is that optimum would be reached in the point of exact equality $\sum_{i,j=1}^na_{ij}^2 = 1$. Then, terms which participate in det calculation with minus sign, must be negative or zero. $$\left( \begin{matrix}  \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac 1 {\sqrt 2} \end{matrix}\right)$$ $$\left( \begin{matrix} \frac 1 {\sqrt 3} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \frac 1 {\sqrt 3} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac 1 {\sqrt 3} \end{matrix}\right)$$ So, I came up with these matrices and respective det values are $\frac 1 2$ and $\frac 1 {3\sqrt 3}$. Is that correct?

It is mentioned that orthonormal bases make for ""good coordinate systems"". I didn't quite digest that - up to this point, I was under the impression that a ""coordinate system"" was just a set of vectors: $\mathbb{R}^2$ would be the set of all vectors with two real numbers, for instance. Now I am told that a basis is also a coordinate system. So clearly my understanding of ""coordinate system"" is not clear. What IS a coordinate system, exactly? Can any set of vectors be a coordinate system? Is a vector space and a subspace considered coordinate systems? (I guess yes, because $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector space).","['coordinate-systems', 'linear-algebra']"
