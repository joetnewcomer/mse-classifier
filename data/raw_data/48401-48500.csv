489232,Z scoring and normal distribution,"I tackled a question that asked Given the mean and std dev for rainfall in a city, Mean = 1126mm of rain std Dev. = 355mm of rain What is the probability that a year would have more than 2191mm of rainfall. The way I went about this was Using the Value - Mean/ Std Dev formula I retrieved a Z score from the table in my textbook as 0.0013 as the answer to the calculation was 3.00 . So I interpreted this as, to get a rainfall value of larger than 2191mm there is a 0.13% chance as the Z score is 0.0013 . So my Question is, how would I calculate this for LESS THAN not MORE THAN 2191, do I just calculate like so? 1 - P where P is 0.13%? EDIT: This is confusing for me then, if that is how you calculate it what if you retrieve a negative Z value If I take 685mm for a graph distributed like so And 685 is clearly towards the left side of the 1126mm mean value. If i retrieve a negative Z score of -1.24 using the same formula above to calculate it, do I just use the Z table normally? If so then I get a value of .1075 and to find out the P of less than 685mm would be 1-.1075 but that would mean the probability of it being less than 685mm is 0.8925 It is obvious that it's not 0.8925 . So I assume that for values less than the mean of  the  given data and you're calculating less than you don't have to do 1-P but if you were calculating the probability of MORE THAN 685mm of rain it would be 1-P. Is this correct thinking or am I going mad? Regards","['statistics', 'normal-distribution']"

489342,Heat equation with Neumann boundary condition,"Background: In our PDE class we explored the heat equation with Dirichlet boundary condition $$u_t - \Delta u = 0 \;\text{ in } \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n \;\text{bounded}\\
u = u_0(x) \;\,\text{at} \; \,t=0\\
u = 0  \;\, \text{at} \;\, \partial \Omega$$ Multiplying by $u$ on both sides and using the divergence theorem gives us $$\frac12 \frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega}u^2 + \int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^2 = 0 \tag{1}$$ Now since the function $u$ is zero on the boundary, we can employ Poincare's inequality and say that $$-\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^2 \leq \frac{-1}{C_{\Omega}}\int_{\Omega}|u|^2,$$ which together with (1) gives that $$\frac12 \frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega}u^2 \leq \frac{-1}{C_{\Omega}}\int_{\Omega}|u|^2,$$ so $\int_{\Omega}u^2$ decays exponentially to $0$ as $t \to \infty$. Question: Having concluded that $\int_{\Omega}u^2$ decays exponentially, we are asked to prove an analogous statement for a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition which says that $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial \vec{\nu}}=0 \;\, \text{at} \;\, \partial\Omega, $$ for $\vec{\nu}$ the normal vector to the boundary. We are given the hint that there is a constant $M_{\Omega}$ with the property that if $u: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ has mean value $0$ then $\int_{\Omega} u^2 \, dx \leq M_{\Omega} \int_{\Omega} |\nabla u|^2 \, dx$. Now, I understand $u$ having mean value zero to mean that $\int_{\Omega} u \, dx=0$. One way to achieve that might be to subtract (the function of $t$) $\int_{\Omega}u\,dx$ from $u$, so that $v : = u - \int_{\Omega}u\,dx$ has mean value zero for all $t$. But this seems to screw things up when we try to square $v$. How can we use the Neumann boundary condition to find out something regarding the mean value of $u$? For instance, the divergence theorem would tell us $$\int_{\partial \Omega} u\cdot \vec{\nu} \, ds = \int_{\Omega} \nabla \cdot u \, dx.$$ The left side here is zero, I believe, but I'm not sure that tells us anything about the mean value. Could someone help me see the next step? I'm stuck.","['multivariable-calculus', 'integration', 'partial-differential-equations', 'derivatives']"
489369,Difference between a type and a set,"I've been trying to understand this distinction for a while, buts its still not making sense to me. Originally, I thought the distinction between type and set was as follows. The relationship between any two sets is already determined. For example, given sets $A$ and $B$ , either its the case that $A \subseteq B,$ or else its the case that $A \not \subseteq B.$ Along a similar vein, we can always take the union of two sets $A$ and $B$ , and we always have $A \subseteq A \cup B.$ Furthermore, in a set-theoretic foundation, no function needs a codomain. On the other hand, types ""float free"" in the universe, and are only related by the functions between them. Thus, we cannot write $A \cup B$ if $A$ and $B$ are types, although we can form the sum type $A + B,$ which is basically a disjoint union. Furthermore, in a type-theoretic foundation, every function needs to have a codomain. So, that's what I used to think. However, for a variety of reasons, the above paragraph is completely wrong ! For example, there are set-theoretic foundations in which sets float free, functions have codomains, etc. (e.g. ETCS ). So now I'm just completely confused. Can someone explain to me, once and for all, what the difference is?","['type-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'definition']"

I think it is monotonic in these variables. I tried with simulations and it works. I also can prove this for scalar case but I would like  to prove it for more general case where $\mathbf{H_i}$, $\mathbf{H_j}$ are complex valued constant matrices.

489388,"Analyticity of a real function on $[0,\infty)$","I'm struggling to understand the difference of the analyticity of a real and a complex functions. Consider the following real valued function which is a minimal example of a somewhat more involved problem. I'm only interested in the behavior on the real axis in the interval $[0,\infty)$ and for $b>1$ $$f(x)=\exp\left( -x^b\right)$$ Since the composition of two analytic functions is again holomorphic, I guess we could reduce this further, leave out the exponential and concentrate on the power function. For this, a related problem was already given in this question although there, the goal was to investigate in the complex plane. Question: What can be said about the analyticity of $f$ especially at $x=0$ when the real valued $b>1$ ? Some observations and side questions I chose $b>1$ to ensure that the derivative exists at $x=0$ . If we derive we get $$\partial_x \,f(x)=-bx^{b-1}\cdot \exp\left(-x^b\right)$$ and choosing $b\leq1$ would lead in the limit $x\to0$ to either $0^0$ or infinity. This doesn't seem to solve anything because even when $b>1$ I cannot calculated the limit $x\to-0$ because the expression is complex (and not real valued) for $x<0$ . This leads to some side questions which I really like to have an answer for: Can one say the first derivative of $f$ exist at $r=0$ , although I cannot take the limit from the right side? If I only need the function for $x\in[0,\infty)$ , what are the practical considerations I have to take care of? Obviously, the second derivative is not ensured to exists.

Theorem: $(A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A) = (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)$ Proof: I'm using element chasing to show that $(A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A) \subseteq (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)$ and $(A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B) \subseteq (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)$. First, let $x \in (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)$. Then we have three options: $x \in A \setminus B \wedge x \in B \setminus A$, so $x \in A \cap B^C \wedge x \in B \cap A^C$. This mean that $x \in A \wedge x \in A^C$ so this is not possible. $x \in A \setminus B \wedge x \notin B \setminus A$. Since $x \in A$, $x \in A \cup B$. Also, $x \notin B$, so $x \notin A \cap B$. Together $x \in (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)$. $x \notin A \setminus B \wedge x \in B \setminus A$. Since $x \in B \cap A^C$, $x \notin A$, so $x \notin A \cap B$. Also, $x \in B$, so $x \in A \cup B$. This means that $x \in (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)$. Then, let $x \in (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)$. That is, $x \in A \cup B \wedge x \notin A \cap B$. Again, we have three options: $x \in A \wedge x \in B$. This means that $x \in A \cap B$, but this contradicts that $x \notin A \cap B$, so this is not an option. $x \in A \wedge x \notin B$. This means that $x \in A \cap B^C$, so that $x \in (A \cap B^C) \cup (B \cap A^C)$, that is, $x \in (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)$. $x \notin A \wedge x \in B$. This means that $x \in A^C \cap B$, so that $x \in (A \cap B^C) \cup (B \cap A^C)$, that is, $x \in (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)$.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"
489432,Self multiplication of a CDF degenerates into a Dirac Delta?,"Because of some work I need to do, I bumped into this problem. A CDF $F(x):\mathbb{R} \mapsto [0,1]$ of some random variable is raised to the n-th power. The function is continuous all over its domain and has the typical characteristics of CDFs (monotonic ascending etc.). What happens when I consider the following? $$\lim_{n\to+\infty}F^n(x)$$ I plotted some stuff and as the power increases, I get an interesting situation. In some cases, it seems like the function tends to a dirac delta, but in other circumstances, I get different evidence. For example, using the Gaussian distribution I have the following: Looks like the function approaches to a delta. In the picture this is not evident sorry, but as $n$ increases, the function looks like converging to a vertical line on the right. If I use an exponent like $n=10000$ I get a diagram with a rect vertical line on the right.
But if I use the exponential CDF: Here no matter the exponent, The curve seems translating to the right.

489556,Is a connected sum of manifolds uniquely defined?,"It is a standard excercise in differential geometry to prove that a connected sum $M\#N$ of two smooth manifolds $M,N$ of the same dimension is uniquely defined (under some assumptions regarding orientation). In the proof one needs to show that $M\#N$ does not depend on: the choice of balls (chart maps) around fixed points $(m,n)\in M\times N$ (assuming that maps in comparison induce the same local orientation near $m$ or $n$), the choice of points. I can prove the first for smooth manifolds (for two neighbourhoods of $m\in M$, I choose such a small neighbourhood that it looks like a ball in both charts, and I observe that the claim is trivial for balls). The second follows from homogeneity of both: topological and smooth manifolds. My question is: Prove or disprove the first point for topological manifolds. If necessary, one can assume orientability, but the smooth case gives hope that the claim may be true also for non-orientable manifolds. Technical clarifications : For the sake of this question ""the"" definition of $M\#N$ is as follows. Take $(m,n)\in M\times N$ and chart maps establishing homeo/diffeo of neighbourhoods of $m,n$ with open balls. Then canonically identify the punctured balls with cylinders and glue the cylinders reversing the vertical coordinate:
$$B\setminus \{m\} \simeq  S^{n-1}\times (0,1)\owns(s,t) \mapsto (s,1-t) \in S^{n-1}\times (0,1)  \simeq B'\setminus \{n\}.$$
To avoid problems we can assume that the chart maps can be extended to bigger balls. P.S. Some related doubts Update: My earlier doubts resolved thanks to discussion in the comments: why wikipedia needs (note that the definition of connected sum in wiki is slightly different than mine): oriented manifolds (in both cases if I understand correctly). Resolved: Thanks to George Lowther's comment I already know that the connected sum depends on the orientation of the spheres/cylinders glued (I missed that in my proof previously). and why it mentions some ""canonical glueing"" as necessary for the uniqueness (in the smooth case)? Resolved: as studiosus states in the comments, the thing is that wikipedia allows ugly diffeomorphisms of spheres that can not be extended to the whole disk, which is not the case in this question, wikipedia claims the answer is affirmative ""crucially"" by the disc theorem , however the article cited handles the differential case. Resolved: The disc theorem is false for the topological case, because a sum of Alexander horned sphere and the bounded component of its complement is homeo with the disk, while the unbounded component is not homeo with complement of the unit disk in $\mathbb R^3$.","['general-topology', 'differential-topology', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

489630,Multiplying the roots of polynomials using only their integer coefficients,"I am trying to write a function that takes the integer coefficients of two polynomials and returns the coefficients of a polynomial that has a root for each way you can multiply a root pair from the pair of input polynomial. The application I had in mind is representing algebraic numbers exactly. Instead of storing a given number $x$ as a float or a symbol, I'd store the coefficients of a polynomial that has $x$ as a root. Operating on numbers stored that way, without losing precision, requires operating on the roots without actually computing the roots. (It's clear to me that this representation strategy has serious flaws, both in terms of efficiency and multiplicity of solutions, but I still want to solve the problem.) Example Suppose the coefficient lists of the input polynomials are [1,0,-1] and [1,5,6]. That is to say, the input is the polynomial $x^2 - 1$ and the polynomial $x^2 + 5x + 6$. They have roots $-1,+1$ and $-2,-3$ respectively. Thus the output polynomial must have roots $-1 \cdot -2,-1 \cdot  -3,1 \cdot  -2,1 \cdot -3 = -3,-2,2,3$ and is equal to $(x-3)(x-2)(x+2)(x+3)$ which is $x^4 - 13x^2 + 36$ and so the output is [1,0,-13,0,36]. Partially Solved I have worked on the problem, and managed to factor the effects of the input polynomials into separate pieces (I think so, anyways). It would take far too long to explain how I got where I am... suffice it to say it was very ad-hoc. The following function seems to compute what I want, and is almost independent of the roots: var decreasings = DecreasingSequencesOfSize(
    length: poly1.Degree, 
    total: indexOfOutputCoefficient, 
    max: poly2.Degree);

var outputCoefficient =
    (from coefRepeatSequence in decreasings
     let coefs2Factor = 
        coefRepeatSequence
        .Select(e => coefs2[e])
        .Product()
     let coefs1Factor = F(coefRepeatSequence, roots1, coefs1)
     select coefs2Factor*coefs1Factor
    ).Sum();

private static BigInteger F(IReadOnlyList<int> d, IReadOnlyList<BigInteger> roots, IReadOnlyList<BigInteger> coefs) {
    return (from p in d.DistinctPermutations()
            select p.Select((e, i) => BigInteger.Pow(roots[i], e)).Product()
           ).Sum();
} I'm sorry if that's not totally clear. I cut down the code as much as possible. Here's an alternate formulation of F, as a recursive function: private static BigInteger F2(IReadOnlyList<int> d, IReadOnlyList<BigInteger> roots) {
    var zeroes = d.Count(e => e == 0);
    if (zeroes == d.Count) return 1;

    var min = d.Min();
    if (min > 0) {
        var mecs = d.Where(e => e > 0).Select(e => e - min).ToArray();
        return BigInteger.Pow(roots.Product(), min) * F2(mecs, roots);
    }

    var decs = d.Where(e => e > 0).ToArray();
    return (from x in roots.Choose(d.Count - zeroes)
            select F2(decs, x)
            ).Sum();
} As you can see, the only dependence on the roots is for computing the function F. It does seem that it can always be reduced to an expression in terms of the coefficients... I can do it by hand for small degree polynomials, and can stumble towards reducing it for larger ones, but I don't see the pattern yet... Question So... Is this problem already solved? Is there a technique I should know about that might help? Am I missing something obvious? Update I used Jyrki's solution, and implemented it.

Let $f = \{ (x,y) | x \in X, y = f(x) \}$ and define $f^{-1} = \{ (y,x) | y \in f(X), x = f^{-1}(y) \}$.  Show that $f^{-1}$ is a one-to-one function from $f(X)$ onto $X$. 1.  Since $f$ is one-to-one, $f(x) = y = f(x') \rightarrow x = x'$.  If $(y, x), (y, x')$ are elements of $f^{-1}$, $x = x'$.  So $f^{-1}$ is a function. 2.  Since $f$ is a function, $y = f(x) = y'$, entailing that if $(y, x), (y', x)$ are elements of $f^{-1}$, $y = y'$.  $f^{-1}$ is one-to-one. 3.  By the fact that the domain of $f^{-1}$ is $f(X)$, for all $x \in X$, there is a $y \in f(X)$ such that (y, x) is an element of $f^{-1}$.  So $f^{-1}$ is onto. I want to argue that there is only one $x$ and only one $y$ such that $(x, y) \in f$ and $(y,x) \in f^{-1}$.  Therefore, $f(f^{-1}(y)) = f(x) = y$ and $f^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}(y) = x$.

Is it really necessary to consider the case when $A=\emptyset$? I mean deductively we are only concerned when $x\in A$ is true. This means that we can directly consider the fact $x\in A$ as true and then deduce $\phi$ and we don't care about the case $A=\emptyset$ so we can forget about it. But then I'm confused here becase I've read in some books and seen some of my teachers saying something like ""if $A=\emptyset$ then the case is trivialy true because.... Let's now suppose
  that $\exists x\in A$, then...."". In the case of my example I would simply write something like: Let's suppose an arbitrary $x$ such that $x\in A$. Then $x\in A \vee x \in B$. This means $x\in A\cup B$, by definition. Therefore $\forall
x(x\in A\longrightarrow x\in A\cup B)$, which means $A\subseteq A\cup
B$. So, my question here is if my proof is really complete or if I'm missing the case when $A=\emptyset$. In a more general case I can think of proving somegthing of the form $\forall x(\phi\longrightarrow \psi)$. Then I would just write as a proof by using deduction something like ""Let's suppose an arbitrary $x$ such that $\phi$ then... but this implies that... therefore $\psi$.

My working theory is that we need only the equation $$V-E+F=2,$$ and the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. In fact, we might also need the fact that the star is a fraction of the whole, and some other symmetry to rely on to create a system of equations. That is $$\frac{V}{n}-\frac{E}{n}+\frac{F}{n}=2$$ and $$\frac{V}{m}-\frac{E}{m}+\frac{F}{m}=2,$$ where we know the relationship between $m$ and $n$. Actually, that makes no sense... Hmm...

I feel this problem is one of algebra. My friend here thinks that if you measured the shape of $T$, then you could find it easily with the surface area of a sphere, but she can't seem to work out how to get the number of $T$'s. If you need more photos, let me know. Just in case you don't see it: This appears to be a snub dodecahedron--as was pointed out by one of the commenters--and can be seen in an overlay here: Look at this: I believe these two can be related in a system of equations via the Euler Characteristic--perhaps I'd need a third distinct shape...

It seems to me that the working convention is that $\sqrt[n]{z}$ refers to the root which makes the smallest angle with the real axis in the complex plane (in the counter-clockwise direction).

If a smooth manifold $X$ is covered by an odd dimensional sphere, then $X$ is orientable. I see this question has been posed here , but it received little attention. The one answer I did see was not particularly illuminating. I hoped that if $X$ was not orientable, then its orientation double cover is connected, and hence by the universal property also covered by $S^{2n+1}$. I'm also aware that $\chi(X)=0$, but I'm not sure how to proceed. Regrettably, this problem is not as easy as the case where the space is covered an even sphere, since this permits you to employ the fact that $Z_2$ is the only group acting freely on $S^{2n}$ (and hence must be $RP^n$ or $S^{2n}$).

490232,Working with projection of areas?,"I was recently solving a physics problem which had to do with the momentum imparted by a photon beam to a perfectly absorbing sphere and a perfectly reflecting one. Considering the former and Putting aside the physical part of the question, I needed to do the following:- Find the net momentum per unit area of the beam $I/c$ and multiply this with a small area on my sphere to ultimately integrate over half a sphere to get the net momentum. My efforts Consider a sphere of $radius=r$ placed with the center on origin of the co-ordinate axes. Let the position vector characterizing the sphere be $$\vec r=r \cos \theta \hat z+r \sin \theta \cos \phi \hat x+ r \sin \theta \sin \phi \hat y$$ Where $\theta$ is the angle of the position vector with $z$ axis and $\phi$ the angle of the projection of the position vector in x-y plane with x axis. Now, suppose the beam is falling along the $x$axis. Therefore at a point $(x,y.z)$ the incoming beam will make an angle $\phi$ with the normal at that point. Therefore, for an area $da=r^2 \sin \theta d\theta d\phi$, the momentum imparted will be $\frac{I}{c} da \cos \phi (-\hat x)$, since the area of the beam imparting momentum on the area $da$ is only $da \cos \phi$ normal to the beam. Therefore the net momentum should be $$\int_0^\pi \int_{-\frac \pi 2}^{\frac \pi 2} \frac {r^2I}c \cos \phi \sin \theta d\phi d\theta (-\hat x)$$ 
But that evaluates to $\frac {4r^2I}c$. But the answer and intuitive understanding ($\pi r^2$ area of the beam is intercepted and absorbed so the net momentum is this area times the momentum per unit area) both gives $\pi r^2I/c$ as the answer. Where did I go wrong? The same problem arises if we consider a reflecting sphere. I guess the problem is in dealing with the projected areas, i.e the projection of $da$ as $da \cos \phi$ normal to the direction of the incoming beam. Sorry if this has a trivial mistake. Can anyone help me with solving the perfectly reflecting case properly? I do not know how to proceed therein appropriately ( in reflection, the laws of reflection need to be followed and the given answer is the same as calculated for the absorption case)","['definite-integrals', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'surfaces']"

For instance, I've seen the following image: I understand intuitively why the triangle is rigid and quadrilateral is non-rigid. It is also my understanding that inserting a single diagonal connection into the quadrilateral would make the shape rigid? However, given the following image (labeling the shapes $S_1$ , $S_2$ and $S_3$ in sequence left to right): If $S_1$ had a single diagonal connection AB, it would be possible to flip ADB over axis q to obtain a shape similar to $S_2$ with the addition of connection AB (my explanation may not be the greatest).

490250,Showing that a given PDE is a solution to harmonic motion via transform,"OK, here's an problem that should, by all accounts, be pretty simple, but I want to make sure I am approaching this correctly. Given: $$\frac{\partial ^2u}{\partial t^2}=c^2\frac{\partial ^2u}{\partial x^2}$$ use the change of variables $\alpha = x+ct$, $\beta = x-ct$ to transform the above equation into $$\frac{\partial ^2u}{\partial \alpha \partial \beta}=0$$ This should be straightforward enough. So, using the chain rule: 
$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}= \frac{\partial u}{\partial \alpha}\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial t}+ \frac{\partial u}{\partial \beta}\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial t} \text{and } \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}= \frac{\partial u}{\partial \alpha}\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x}+ \frac{\partial u}{\partial \beta}\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial x}$$ we take the partial derivatives with respect to t and x in the alpha and beta expressions: $$\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial t}=c, \frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x} = 1,\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial t}=-c,\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial x}=1$$ Plug these back into the above PDEs: 
$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=c \frac{\partial u}{\partial \alpha}-c \frac{\partial u}{\partial \beta} \text{and } \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}= \frac{\partial u}{\partial \alpha}+ \frac{\partial u}{\partial \beta}$$ taking another derivative with respect to beta: 
$$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t \partial \beta}=c \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \alpha \partial  \beta}-c \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \beta^2} \text{and } \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x \partial \beta}= \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \alpha \partial \beta}+ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \beta^2}$$ I saw there are two terms that are $\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \alpha \partial \beta}$ and rearranging things a bit, and noting they are equal: $$ c \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \alpha \partial  \beta}=c \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \beta^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t \partial \beta} \text{and } \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \alpha \partial \beta}=\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \beta^2}-\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x \partial \beta}  $$
The problem I am having is that I feel I messed up a substitution someplace. Because I end up with $$-c\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x \partial \beta}=\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t \partial \beta}$$
and the terms aren't going to zero. Or there's some stupidly simple step I missed. I guess what I am asking is if I am right so far.","['harmonic-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"

490415,How do the infinitesimal generators generate the whole compact Lie group?,"Suppose that $G$ is a connected compact Lie group, $g(a)\in G$ is its element, and $a=(a_1,a_2,...,a_r)$ is the parameter of the group element $g(a)$. Then the infinitesimal generator of the group can be defined as 
\begin{equation}
X_i=\frac{\partial{g(a)}}{\partial{a_i}}\bigg|_{a=0} 
\end{equation}
Then an infinitesimal element $g(\delta a)=E+\sum_i \delta a_i X_i$, in which
$\delta a\in O({\bf0})$, $E=g({\bf0})$ is the identity element and $O({\bf0})$ is the neighborhood of the ${\bf 0}$ point in parameter space. We know that the parameter of the product of two infinitesimal elements is the sum of the parameters of the two infinitesimal elements (to the first order of the infinitesimal parameter), that is
$$
g(\delta a)g(\delta b)=(E+\sum_i \delta a_i X_i)(E+\sum_i \delta b_i X_i)=E+\sum_i (\delta a_i+\delta b_i) X_i=g(\delta a+\delta b). \tag{1}
$$
Then, in every book I have read, it says that, any finite element $g(a)$ can be generated by $\{X_i\}$: let $\delta a=a/N$,
\begin{align}
g(a)=g(N\frac{a}{N})=g(N\delta a)&=g(\delta a+\delta a+...+\delta a)\\
 &=*=g(\delta a)g(\delta a)...g(\delta a)=g(\delta a)^N\\
 &=(E+\sum_i\delta a_iX_i)^N=(E+\frac{\sum_i a_iX_i}{N})^N\\
 &=\exp(\sum_i a_iX_i)~~[\text{let } N\rightarrow \infty] \tag{2}
\end{align}
In the above proof, the key step is the $(=*=)$ step, which uses the relation in Eq.(1) $g(\delta a+\delta b)=g(\delta a)g(\delta b)$. But this relation is ONLY valid for infinitesimal elements and between two infinitesimal elements, it can not be used to derive the $(=*=)$ step directly because  both $a$ is finite and there are $N$ elements here. My questions are: Since the ($=*=$) step is wrong, is the conclusion Eq.(2) also wrong? (not limited to this proof) If the the conclusion Eq.(2) is right, how to prove it in a right way? I think I have a counterexample. Using the same logic as the above proof, we consider a scalar function $f(x)$ with single parameter. It has the property $f(0)=1$. Then the ""infinitesimal generator"" of $f(x)$ is just its derivative at 0, let it be
$$
t=\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}\bigg|_{x=0}=f'(0)
$$
Then for any infinitesimal parameter $\delta x$ and $\delta y$, to the first order, we have $f(\delta x)=f(0)+f'(0)\delta x=1+\delta x\cdot t$ and $f(\delta y)=1+\delta y\cdot t$, and 
$$
  f(\delta x)f(\delta y)=(1+\delta x\cdot t)(1+\delta y\cdot t)=1+(\delta x+\delta y)t=f(\delta x+\delta y)
$$
Then, if the logic in Eq.(2) is right, we can also derive the conclusion that: ""For any finite $x$, there is the relation $f(x)=\exp(tx)$"". But this conclusion is obviously wrong! Because here $f(x)$ can be any function satisfying $f(0)=1$, e.g. $f(x)=1+\sin(x)$. Obviously, $1+\sin(x)\ne\exp(tx)$ ! Only when $f(x)$ satisfies $f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)$ for any $x$ and $y$ (not limited to infinitesimal parameters), we can derive $f(x)=\exp(tx)$.","['lie-groups', 'group-theory']"

490610,Balls and bins conditioned on the number of non-empty bins,"The expected number of occupied bins in the standard balls and bins problem (with $m$ balls into $N$ bins) is $N\left( {1 - {{\left( {1 - \frac{1}{N}} \right)}^m}} \right)$. How do I compute this expectation given that at least $k$ bins are non-empty after the $m$ balls were thrown? In particular, how do I formulate the probability that some $i^{th}$ bin is empty given that at least $k$ bins are non-empty? in addition, it seems obivious, but how do I prove that the conditional expectation is a monotonic increasing function of $k$?","['balls-in-bins', 'probability']"
490629,"About solutions to $x^2+y^2+z^2=8n+3,n\in \mathbb N$","As we know that $x^2+y^2+z^2=8n+3,(n\in \mathbb N)\tag{1}$ has integer solutions $x,y,z\in  \mathbb N.$ If $k\in \mathbb N$ has at least one prime factor which is $\equiv 3 \mod 4,$ then we call $k$ a good number. If $x^2+y^2+z^2=8n+3\implies x,y,z$ are all good numbers, then we call $n$ a nice number. For example, $n=8$ is a nice number since $x^2+y^2+z^2=8n+3\implies \{x,y,z\}=\{7,3,3\}.$ $n=8, 17, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62, 71, 152, 176\cdots$ are all nice numbers. Is it true that if $n$ is a nice number then $x^2+y^2+z^2=8n+3\implies 3\mid xyz$? PS: It seems that  if $n$ is a nice number then $n\equiv 2 \pmod 3,$ hence $8n+3\equiv 1 \pmod 3,$ hence two of $x,y,z \equiv 0\pmod 3,$ and the rest one $\equiv \pm1\pmod 3.$ Here are some eaxmples($n<2000$): $\{n,\{x,y,z\}\}$ {8,{{3,3,7}}} {17,{{3,3,11},{3,7,9}}} {26,{{3,9,11},{7,9,9}}} {35,{{3,7,15},{9,9,11}}} {44,{{3,11,15},{7,9,15}}} {53,{{9,11,15}}} {62,{{3,7,21},{7,15,15}}} {71,{{3,11,21},{7,9,21},{11,15,15}}} {152,{{3,11,33},{7,9,33},{7,21,27}}} {176,{{3,21,31},{15,15,31},{21,21,23}}} {233,{{3,3,43},{7,27,33},{11,15,39}}} {314,{{7,21,45},{9,15,47},{15,21,43}}} {395,{{7,33,45},{11,21,51},{11,39,39},{15,27,47},{15,33,43}}} {698,{{3,33,67},{9,45,59},{23,33,63},{31,45,51}}} {743,{{3,3,77},{15,31,69},{21,45,59},{27,27,67},{39,45,49}}} {887,{{3,23,81},{3,51,67},{9,33,77},{21,27,77},{23,51,63},{27,49,63},{33,39,67}}} {1265,{{3,33,95},{3,67,75},{9,59,81},{15,63,77},{23,45,87},{23,63,75},{31,51,81}}} {1328,{{3,3,103},{9,39,95},{27,63,77},{39,59,75},{49,51,75}}} {1832,{{3,3,121},{3,31,117},{3,75,95},{9,63,103},{9,77,93},{21,23,117},{23,81,87},{39,67,93},{45,45,103},{51,67,87},{63,69,77}}} {1958,{{3,23,123},{9,81,95},{23,87,87},{33,63,103},{33,77,93},{59,75,81}}}","['diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"

490647,Can there be an abelian group $G$ where $\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb N} nG$ is not divisible?,"I heard a talk yesterday on MacIntyre's theorems, which involved a decomposition of ($\omega$-stable) groups into a divisible part and a bounded exponent part.  Apparently there is a result of Kaplansky that all abelian groups have a maximal divisible part. Clearly, if $D$ is a divisible subgroup, then $D=\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb N} nD\subseteq \bigcap_{n\in\mathbb N} nG$.  Under certain hypotheses (e.g. $\omega$-saturation of the group), it's easy to show that this subset relation is actually equality.  I was told that some hypothesis is necessary to guarantee that, which made me wonder: Is there an abelian group $G$ such that $\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb N} nG$ is not divisible? So, there would have to be an element $x$ which is ""divisible"" (in that you can divide $x$ by $n$ for every $n>0$, since $x\in \bigcap_{n\in\mathbb N}nG$), but in order to divide it by $n$, the result must not be divisible (i.e. for some $n$, and every $y$, if $ny=x$, then $y$ is not ""divisible""). Is such a group possible?","['group-theory', 'model-theory']"
490674,Hartshorne Example II 4.0.1 [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : How to compute the topological space of fibered product of schemes? (2 answers) Closed 10 years ago . This example wanted to show if $k$ is a field, $X$ the affine line with a double point as in Ex 2.3.6, then X is not separated. It argued that $X$(product over $k$)$X$ is affine plane with double axes and four origins. It is not closed because all four origins are in the closure of the diagonal.So the diagonal is not a closed immersion. But I don't know how to display the product scheme explicitly. Although it looks natural, usually the underlying space of the product scheme may not be the product of the corresponding topological spaces. I tried to construct it from the method in arbitrary product schemes but got messy. Can anyone help me with that?
