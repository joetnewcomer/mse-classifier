82804,Surface area of a flexible tube,"Consider the hollow tube formed by sweeping a circle of radius $r(t)$ along a curve $\gamma(t)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$; in other words, the set of points $$S=\{\gamma(t) + r(t) \hat{n}\quad \vert\quad \|\hat n\| = 1, \hat{n}\cdot \gamma'(t) = 0, t \in [a,b]\}.$$ What is the surface area of this tube? There are some easy special cases: when $\gamma$ is a straight line, $S$ is a surface of revolution. When $r$ is constant and $\gamma$ is a circle, $S$ is a torus -- and, surprisingly, the surface area of this torus is the same as if we ""straightened"" the centerline of the tube, turning the torus into a cylinder! Does a similar result hold generally?","['surfaces', 'differential-geometry']"
82816,Mixing two different biased coins,"My problem is as follows: I have two biased coins with probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$ of landing heads. I start with coin 1 and toss it until it lands heads. Then I swap to coin 2 and toss until it lands heads. I then repeat the procedure until I have tossed $n$ times. $X_n$ is the random variable which counts the number of heads in the process. My objective is to show that with probability $1-e^{-\Omega(n)}$ $X_n$ will be in the interval $[(1-\varepsilon)\mathbb{E}[X_n], (1+\varepsilon)\mathbb{E}[X_n]]$ for a fixed $\varepsilon>0$. I have observed that if $p_1<p_2$ I know that $np_1\leq\mathbb{E}[X_n]\leq np_2$ so if I can somehow use Chernoff's or Azuma's inequality I don't need to calculate the expectation of $\mathbb{E}[X_n]$. I have tried looking at this problem with Markov chains but I haven't been successful there. I have also observed that for each $n$ I can define new random variables $Y_{k,n}$ where I throw coin 1 $k$ times and coin 2 $n-k$ times and let $Y_{k,n}$ denote the number of heads I got. I then know that for each $n$ there exists a unique $k$ such that $\mathbb{E}[Y_{k,n}]\leq \mathbb{E}[X_n] < \mathbb{E}[Y_{k+1,n}]$. I can't take that approach further though because I can't find suitable bounds for the variance of $X_n$ I'm not asking you to spoil the problem for me. I'm merely asking if someone could push me in the right direction.","['asymptotics', 'probability']"
82817,Modulus of Continuity,"Let $\rho(t)$ be a function on the set $\mathbb{R}^+$ of nonnegative real numbers such that: $\rho$ is nondecreasing (and continuous - thanks for the correction) $\rho(t) = 0$ if and only if $t = 0$ Let $X$ be a metric space and let $f$ be a real valued function on $X$.  Say that $f$ has modulus of continuity $\rho$ if $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq \rho(d(x,y))$ for every $x$ and $y$ in $X$.  For example, a function is Lipschitz if and only if it has modulus of continuity $Ct$ for some positive real number $C$.  Observe that a function with modulus of continuity $\rho$ is necessarily continuous. Question: If $X$ is a compact metric space without isolated points, is it true that the set of all functions with modulus of continuity $\rho$ is nowhere dense (meaning its closure contains no open set) in $C(X)$ equipped with the supremum norm? I am a TA in a class in which it was claimed that the answer is yes, but I don't completely believe the proof given and I can't seem to find a correct argument except in special cases.  For example, one can show that the set of all Lipschitz functions on $[0,1]$ with Lipschitz constant $C$ is nowhere dense in $C[0,1]$ using the existence of piecewise linear functions of arbitrarily small norm whose linear pieces all have slope larger than $C$ (or smaller than -C).  So the idea for general $X$ should be to construct continuous functions of arbitrarily small norm with arbitrarily rapid oscillation, but I don't see how to do this.

The example I have in mind is the sphere $S^2$ : it seems clear that the usual metric gives maximal symmetry and that any other metric would either give the same group of symmetry or one strictly smaller.

82866,"If $X^n+Y^n+1$ is reducible, is the degree divisible by the characteristic?","I was playing around with the Frobenius map, and made a small observation. Suppose $F$ is a field, and $F[X,Y]$ is the corresponding polynomial ring in two indeterminates. If $\text{char}(F)=p$ divides some integer $n$, then $n=pq$ for some $q$. Consider the polynomial $X^n+Y^n+1$. Then
$$
X^n+Y^n+1=X^{pq}+Y^{pq}+1^{pq}=(X^q+Y^q+1^q)^p
$$
so $X^n+Y^n+1$ is reducible. I hope this observation is correct. Does the converse also hold? That is, if $X^n+Y^n+1$ is reducible, can you conclude that $\text{char}(F)$ divides $n$?

82871,Examples of Taylor series with interesting convergence along the boundary of convergence?,"In most standard examples of power series, the question of convergence along the boundary of convergence has one of several ""simple"" answers.  (I am considering power series of a complex variable.) The series always converges along its boundary $\left(\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n^2}\right)$ The series never converges along its boundary $\left(\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^\infty\ x^n\right)$ The series diverges at precisely one point along its boundary $\left(\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty\ \frac{x^n}{n}\right)$ The series diverges at a finite number of points along its boundary (add several examples of the preceding type together). Can anything else happen? For starters, are there examples where the series converges at
precisely a finite number of points along the boundary? Can there be a dense mixture of convergence and divergence along the boundary?  For example, maybe a series with radius $1$ that converges for $x=\mathrm{e}^{2\pi it}$ with $t$ rational, but diverges when $t$ is irrational. Can there be convergence in large connected regions on the boundary with simultaneous divergence in other large connected regions?  For example, a series with radius $1$ that converges along the ""right side"" of the boundary $\left(x=\mathrm{e}^{2\pi it}\mbox{ with }t\in\left(-\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4}\right)\right)$ and diverges elsewhere on the boundary.

82876,"Given a prime $p\in\mathbb{N}$, is $A=\frac{x^{p^{2}}-1}{x^{p}-1}$ irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$?","If $p \in \mathbb{N}$ is a prime, is $\displaystyle A=\frac{x^{p^{2}}-1}{x^{p}-1}$ irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$? I don't think it is. If somebody sees a contradiction, I would be glad to see it. The link of Qiaochu links to the Eisenstein criterion. There it is written that: cyclotomic polynomials can be obtained by dividing the polynomial $x^{p}-1$ (in this case $x^{p^{2}}-1$) by $x-1$ (in this case $x^{p}-1$, which is it's obvious root. Then the article makes a substitution so the criterion can be applied: by substituing x+1 for x this gives : $((x+1)^{p}-1)/x = x^{p-1} + (p nCR p-1)x^{p-2} + .... + (p nCR 1) $. The coefficients are divisible by p  because of the properties of binomial coefficients, and therefore not divisible by $p^{2}$. How to find the substitution so Eisenstein criterion can be applied?

82944,Interpolating between the $L^{p}$ norm and the Hölder semi-norm,"Set-up. For a bounded continuous function $u \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, the $\gamma$-Hölder semi-norm of $u$ is 
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
[u]_{C^\gamma} 
&=& 
\sup \left\{\frac{|u(x) - u(y)|}{|x-y|^\gamma} : x,y \in U, x \neq y \right\} 
\\ &=&
\inf \left\{ C \geq 0 : |u(x) - u(y)| \leq C |x-y|^{\gamma} \text{ for all } x,y \in U \right\}.
\end{eqnarray}
$$ The Problem Fix $1 \leq p < \infty$, $0 < \gamma \leq 1$, and $0 < \lambda < 1$ such that
$$
0 = \frac{\lambda}{p} - (1-\lambda)\frac{\gamma}{n}.
$$
I am trying to prove that there is a constant $C$ such that
$$
\|u\|_{L^\infty} \leq C \|u\|_{L^p}^{\lambda} [u]_{C^\gamma}^{1-\lambda}
$$
for every compactly supported $C^{1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ function $u$. My Strategy My plan is to use the interpolation result for Lebesgue spaces:  For every $q,r$ satisfying $p < q < r \leq \infty$ and 
$$
\frac{1}{q} = \frac{\lambda}{p} + \frac{1-\lambda}{r},
$$
we have
$$
\|u\|_{L^q} \leq \|u\|_{L^{p}}^{\lambda} \|u\|_{L^r}^{1-\lambda}
$$
for every $u \in L^p \cap L^r$. Solving for $1/r$ in terms of $q$ and using the relationship between $p$, $\gamma$, and $n$, we find
$$
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1/q - \lambda/p}{1-\lambda} = \frac{1/q}{1-\lambda} - \frac{\gamma}{n}
$$
So, by letting $q \to \infty$, we have $r \to -n / \gamma$, and
$$
\frac{1}{q} = \frac{\lambda}{p} + \frac{1-\lambda}{r},
$$
goes to
$$
0 = \frac{\lambda}{p} - (1-\lambda)\frac{\gamma}{n}.
$$
Meanwhile, for $u \in L^{\infty}$ (which certainly holds when $u$ is compactly supported and $C^1$), we have that $\lim_{q \to \infty} \|u\|_{L^q} =\|u\|_{L^\infty}$. So if I could prove that $\|u\|_r \to [u]_{C^{\gamma}}$ as $q \to \infty$ (i.e., as $r \to -n / \gamma$), I'd be done. The problem is that I don't know how to prove this.  Moreover, I'm not sure if this is even the right approach to prove the desired inequality. Can someone please help me out?","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

82997,When is a local algebra reduced?,"Let $k$ be a field and let $A$ be a local $k$-algebra which has finite dimension over $k$. Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $A$ and let $k' = A / \mathfrak{m}$ be the residue field. For every $a \in A$ we define $\mathrm{Tr}(a) \in k$ the trace of the $k$-linear endomorphism $A \to A$ given by the multiplication by $a$. The map $\mathrm{Tr} \colon A \to k$ is $k$-linear. Consider the symmetric $k$-bilinear form $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle \colon A \times A \to k$ given by $\langle a, b \rangle = \mathrm{Tr}(ab)$. Now consider the following statements: $A$ is reduced, or equivalently $\mathfrak{m} = 0$, i.e. $A = k'$; $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ is non-degenerate; $k' / k$ is a finite separable extension of fields. $\mathrm{Tr} \colon A \to k$ is surjective. (Some assertions contained in this paragraph are wrong.) I know a proof of the facts ""(2) implies (1)"" and ""(2) iff (3) iff (4)"". (1) does not implies (2) because it suffices to pick $A$ as an inseparable finite field extension of $k$. Is there some fact which involves the field extension $k' / k$ and which is equivalent to (1)? My question comes from studying the property of the discriminant and the ramification in finite extensions of Dedekind domains. Lemma 7.4.14 at page 289 of Qing Liu's Algebraic geometry and arithmetic curves concerns the problem above; but, in my opinion, the condition ""every nilpotent element $\epsilon$ of $A$ verifies $\epsilon^m = 0$ for some integer $m$ prime to $\mathrm{char}(k)$"" is empty. Am I wrong? It seems to me that the following proposition holds: Proposition Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer and let $A$ be a noetherian ring with nilradical $\mathcal{N}$. There exists an integer $m$ prime to $n$ such that $\mathcal{N}^m = 0$. EDIT . I hope to do true assertions, unlike my original post. (2) implies (1) because a nilpotent element of $A$ belongs to the radical of the form $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$. If (1) holds, then (2), (3) and (4) are equivalent. (4) holds if an only if $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ is non zero. So it is obvious that (2) implies (4). Now consider the further statement: 5 . $k'/k$ is separable and every nilpotent element of $A$ has nilpotence order prime to $\mathrm{char} (k)$. (4) and (5) are equivalent by the lemma cited above.So (4) implies (3). Now my questions are: Is there exists a proof of the lemma cited above that does not require scheme theory? Are there any other implications among the statements above?

83011,Conditional Expectation and the floor function,"I have a piece of code the produces random integers. int c = 250 - (int) floor(rand() * 50);
    while (c < 0) {
        c = 250 - (int) floor(rand() * 50);
    } The floor() function returns the largest floating-point value less than or equal to the argument and that is equal to an integer. The rand() function returns floating-point values drawn from the standard normal distribution. Let's assume that both functions work as intended and that the pseudo random number generator works correctly, otherwise further discussion would be pointless. The question is, what is the expectation of the integers generated by this piece of code? Casting the code in mathematical terms, I want to calculate the conditional expectation
$\mathbb{E}\bigl[250-\lfloor50\cdot Z\rfloor\quad\vert\quad 250-\lfloor50\cdot Z\rfloor\ge0\bigr]$ where the random variable Z is standard normal distributed, that is $Z\sim N(0,1)$. The condition stems from the fact, that the code above throws away negative integers and draws again. Note that $\lfloor250 - 50\cdot x\rfloor=250-\lfloor 50\cdot x\rfloor$ holds, so the placement of the floor function shouldn't make a difference. The question at this point is, is this mathematical model correctly describing what is going on in the code? I think so, if you think otherwise please leave a comment. The reason for the linear transformation $250-50\cdot x$ above is simply that via rand() only a standard normal distribution is available. And $X=\mu-\sigma\cdot Z$ just turns an $N(0,1)$ distribution into an $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ distribution, here $N(250,50^2)$, so the standard normal distribution is shifted to the right and widened. Rejecting negative integers corresponds to truncating $N(250, 50^2)$ at $0$ removing the lower tail. Neglecting the floor function for a moment, my intuition is, that the truncation of the distribution and the necessary rescaling should move the mean further to the right, that is $\mathbb{E}\bigl[X\bigr]>250$ when $X\sim N_{\ge0}(250,50^2)$. Indeed Mathematica confirms N[Expectation[x,  x \[Distributed] TruncatedDistribution[{0, \[Infinity]}, 
TransformedDistribution[250 - 50*x, x \[Distributed] NormalDistribution[]]]], 30]

250.000074335997045245285622087 By the definition of the expectation for a continuous distribution we have
$$
\mathbb{E}\bigl[250-50\cdot Z \quad \vert \quad 250-50\cdot Z\ge0\bigr]=\mathbb{E}[X]=\int_{-\infty}^\infty x f(x)\;dx
$$
with $Z\sim N(0,1)$ and $X\sim N_{\ge0}(250,50^2)$. The pdf $f(x)$ of the truncated and transformed standard normal distribution is
$$
f(x)=\frac{g(x)}{1-\Phi\left(\frac{0-250}{50}\right)}\qquad g(x)=\begin{cases}0&x<0\\\phi\left(\frac{x-250}{50}\right)&x\ge0\end{cases}
$$
where $\phi(x)$ and $\Phi(x)$ are the pdf and cdf of the standard normal distribution. The scaling factor $1-\Phi\left(\frac{0-250}{50}\right)$ is just the probability mass that is left after truncation. Dividing by it ensures that we have a distribution. And indeed
$$
\int_0^\infty f(x)\;dx=1
$$
is checked easily. Now the only way I know of incorporating the floor function, is by treating it as what it is, a piecewise constant function. The next goal is to turn this continuous distribution into a step function. Each step collects all the floating-point values that are mapped by the floor function onto the same integer. Therefore
$$
h(a)=\int_a^{a+1}f(x)\;dx
$$
is the height of the step $[a,a+1]$ where $a\in\mathbb{N_0}$. Checking that the step function is a probability distribution yields
$$
\sum_{a=0}^\infty h(a)=1
$$
Now the sought-after expectation should simply be
$$
\mathbb{E}\bigl[250-\lfloor50\cdot Z\rfloor \quad \vert \quad 250-\lfloor50\cdot Z\rfloor\ge0\bigr]=\sum_{a=0}^\infty a\cdot h(a)
$$
A quick computation with Mathematica evaluates this sum to be 249.5000743384745... Which is puzzling me for two reasons. My intuition is that the mean should shift to the right, not left, despite the flooring. Actually executing the code, letting it produce a sample of random integers of size 317440000 yields a mean of 250.507 Calculating $h(0)$ and $h(250)$ and comparing them to their respective relative frequencies from the sample yields
$$
\begin{align*}
h(0)&=0.0000000312698&h(250)&=0.00797832\\
h(1)&=0.0000000345445&h(251)&=0.00797513\\
\hat{h}(0)&=0.0000000346522&\hat{h}(250)&=0.00796824
\end{align*}
$$
A statistician may find it amusing to test whether the hypothesis that my derivation of the expectation is correct should be rejected. For me this hints an off-by-one error and it turns out that taking the right endpoint of the step and summing
$$
\sum_{a=0}^\infty (a+1)\cdot h(a)
$$
yields 250.50007433847... Assuming that Mathematica works correctly and the generation of the sample and its processing are correct and that this derivation actually describes what the code is doing, this suggests that I have made an off-by-one error. Unfortunately I cannot pinpoint the error. So the questions are: Can someone pinpoint an error in the modeling? Can someone pinpoint an off-by-one error? Can someone pinpoint another error? Perhaps my intuition is flawed once again and someone can confirm the expectation of $249.5+\epsilon$ by another method? Can someone confirm the expectation of $250.5+\epsilon$ by another method?

And the post office metric is defined by $m(x,y) = d(x,0) + d(y,0)$ for distinct points $x$ and $y$, and $m(x,x) = 0$ where $d$ is metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$. My idea for the proof: For every $x \in \mathbb R^2$ we can find an $r_x$ such that $x$ is seperated from other elements of $\mathbb R^2$ (for instance if $r_x = d(x,0)$). And for a $D$ which is dense in $\mathbb R^2$ we can find a $y \in D$ st $y \in B(x,r_x)$. Then, we can match each $x \in \mathbb R^2$ with a $y \in D$. And since $\mathbb R^2$ is uncountable, $D$ is also uncountable. Thus, $\mathbb R^2$ is not separable since any dense set in it is uncountable. Is my proof correct? I am not sure since $r_x$ depends on $x$.",['real-analysis']

Imbed $S_n$ as a subgroup of $A_{n+2}$, but show, for $n\ge2$, that $S_n$ cannot be imbedded in $A_{n+1}.$ Since the alternate subgroup has the property of even parity, I thought that a little investigation of parity for the second and third symmetric groups was in order. So I constructed a table for each of them, grouped by even and odd number of disjoint products. I'll forego writing the actual table and simply provide the answers. In symmetric groups with an even idegree, two even permutations come together under composition to produce an even permutation. Two odds also make an even. Two different parities produce odd elements. When the symmetric group has an odd degree, e.g. $S_3$, two odds make an odd, two evens make an odd, and two different parities make an even element. Exactly the opposite results from the symmetric groups with even index. Two questions: is this enough to prove the $A_{n+1}$ case?

83182,"Modulus of Continuity, Take 2","This is a follow-up to my last question: Modulus of Continuity .  I accidentally asked the wrong question there, so I'm going to start over and hopefully ask the right question. I'll repeat the relevant definitions.  Let $\rho: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+$ be a continuous nondecreasing function such that $\rho(t) = 0$ if and only of $t = 0$.  If you can answer my question in the special case $\rho(t) = Ct$ where $C$ is a constant then it will probably be possible to adapt your construction to the general case. Say that a function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ on a metric space has modulus of continuity $\rho$ at a point $x_0 \in X$ if $|f(x) - f(x_0)| \leq \rho(d(x,x_0))$ for every $x \in X$.  For example, a function has modulus of continuity $Ct$ at $x_0$ if and only if it is Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant $C$ at $x_0$. Question If $X$ is a compact metric space without isolated points, is it true that the set of all continuous functions on $X$ which have modulus of continuity $\rho$ at some point of $X$ is nowhere dense in $C(X)$ equipped with the supremum norm? To prove that the answer is affirmative for a given $X$ one must be able to construct functions of arbitrarily small norm which oscillate arbitrarily rapidly.  For example, if $\rho(t) = Ct$ and $X = [0,1]$ then one can use a piecewise linear function such that the slope of each linear piece is larger than $C$ in absolute value.  However, I don't see how to generalize this idea to an arbitrary compact metric space without isolated points.","['metric-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

I also have limited access to a sequence $Y_1,\ldots,Y_n$ of elements of $X$, where $n$ is really fairly small, like $n ≤ 50$.  I would like to know the identification $f : [1..n] → [1..m]$ so that $Y_i = X_{f(i)}$. The problem is I only have limited access to the $X_i$ and the $Y_i$: I have random variables $x_i$ and $y_i$ on unknown, but hopefully somewhat uniform, measure spaces, that take values in $X_i$ and $Y_i$. Sampling $x_i$ and $y_i$ takes a small but non-neglible time, and I wish to compute $f$ as quickly as possible.  My plan is to simply keep records of the samples, and look for collisions, since $X_i$ and $Y_j$ are either equal or disjoint.  I can generate about one thousand samples per second. The question is how often should I sample from the $x_i$, and how often from the $y_i$? I began by only sampling once from the $x_i$, and then sampling the $y_j$ until I found that specific value of $x_i$, but this seems very unlikely to happen early (out of $578000$ $y$ samples, I have $532405$ distinct values, none of which are the specific $x$ values found).

How can one get the monomial symmetric functions $m_\lambda(X_1,X_2,...,X_N)$ as products and sums in $e_k$?
For example: $N=4$ 
$$
m_{(2,1,1,0)}=X_1^2X_2X_3 + \text{all permutations}= e_3\cdot e_1 - 4 e_4 ,

$$
m_{(2,2,0,0)}=X_1^2X_2^2 + ... = e_2^2-6e_4 - 2m_{(2,1,1,0)}=e_2^2 - 2e_3\cdot e_1 +2e_4

It seems clear that the products on the RHS run over all partitions $\mu$ of $N$. For each $\lambda$ there should be a set of integers $C_{\lambda\mu}$ such that
$$
m_\lambda  = \sum_\mu C_{\lambda \mu} \prod_j e_{\mu_j}

and for $N=2$ we get

For a given $N$, is it a kind of composition of matrices $C_{k<N}$ and some few other matrices? Beside that, the following is also of interest: 
The matrices so far are symmetric and their entries sum up to $0$. Is this true in general? Is this related to (conjugate) Young Tableaux? Balls&Boxes If we bring the matrix on the LHS we get:

(b) In the plane $x,y$ the circle is $x = a + b \cos \psi$ , $y = b \sin \psi$ . From part (a), we get the following parametrization for the torus: $$x = (a + b \cos \psi)\cos \theta, \quad y = b \sin \psi, \quad z = (a + b \cos \psi)\sin \theta$$ where $0\leq\psi,\theta\leq 2\pi$ .

Tate was trying to convey that one must relate the $L$ -function to some Galois-groups, that was the rough picture in my mind! But later luckily to my surprise it was a coincidence that in an work of John Coates (John Coates, The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves with Complex  Multiplication , Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians Helsinki, 1978, pdf - warning, large file!), I encountered the same words where Coates describes that "".....They also gave a conjectural formulathe coefficient of $\large(s-1)^{g_{Q}}$ ( $g_{Q}$ is rank) in the expansion of $L(E,s)$ about $s=1$ but we shall not discuss this here.

characteristic polynomial of some canonical element  in a

For any $x \in D$, the subfield $K(x)$ of $D$ has a unique extension of the valuation on $K$, so I can define $v: K \to \mathbb Z \cup \{\infty\}$ by setting $v(x) = v_D(x): = v_{K(x)}(x)$. But why is $v$ defined this way multiplicative? That is, why is $v_{K(xy)} (xy) = v_{K(x)} (x) + v_{K(y)}(y)$? It's clear in the case that $x$ and $y$ commute: then all three fields $K(xy)$, $K(x)$, and $K(y)$ are all subfields of the field $K(x, y)$, and the valuations on the three subfields agree with the restriction on the valuation on $K(x, y)$. But this should be true for any $x, y \in D$. (Here's a silly argument I can make. Construct $v$ instead using the reduced norm. Then it's clear that $v$ is multiplicative. Also show that $v$ extends the valuation on $K$ and on intermediate fields, and is non-Archimedean -- this last using the trick that, by multiplicativity, $v(x + y) = v(x) + v(1 + y/x)$, and then $y/x$ and $1$ live in the same subfield.

Doing this for each place of $k$ gives a map $\beta:H^2(K/k,\mathbb{G}_m)\rightarrow\prod_vH^2(K_w/k_v,\mathbb{G}_m)$ (this requires choosing a place above each $v$). My question: is there an obvious reason that the image of $\beta$ is contained in the direct sum of the local cohomology groups? Phrased differently: is a global class with coefficients in the multiplicative group locally trivial almost everywhere? I know that the image of $\beta$ is contained in the direct sum because if $I_K$ is the idele group of $K$, then by considerations with Shapiro's lemma and some cohomological results from local class field theory (specifically the vanishing of the cohomology of units for an unramified extension), one gets $H^2(K/k,I_K)\cong\sum_vH^2(K_w/k_v,\mathbb{G}_m)$, and the composite $H^2(K/k,\mathbb{G}_m)\rightarrow H^2(K/k,I_K)\rightarrow\sum_vH^2(K_w/k_v,\mathbb{G}_m)$, where the first map comes by embedding $K$ into $I_K$ diagonally, is $\beta$. I'm wondering if there is an easier way. By passing to the limit over all finite Galois extensions, one gets the corresponding locally trivially almost everywhere result for $H^2(\bar{k}/k,\mathbf{G}_m)$, which is what I really care about. I know that this result can be proved by identifying $H^2$ with the Brauer group of $k$ and invoking the fact that a central simple algebra over $k$ is split almost everywhere (admittedly I don't know much about this point of view, so I don't know how hard this fact is). I'm not sure how to describe what kind of argument I'm looking for, and it's entirely possible I've missed an easy one. I'm hoping to use just basic facts about Galois cohomology. I guess I have in mind something like proving that a class in $H^1(\bar{k}/k,A)$ is locally unramified almost everywhere for a discrete $\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)$-module $A$, which just uses the fact that any class comes from $H^1$ of a finite Galois extension, which is unramified outside finitely many places.

Show that the $n$-family $(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ is affinely independent if and only if the $n$-family $(\bar{x_{1}},...,\bar{x_{n}})$ of vectors from $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ is linearly independent. - Here is what I have so far, it is mostly just writing out definitions, if you can give me some hints towards how I can start the problem that would be great. $(\Rightarrow)$ Assume that for $x_{i} = (\alpha_{1i},...,\alpha_{di})$, the $n$-family $(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ is affinely independent. Then, a linear combination $\lambda_{1}x_{1} + ... + \lambda_{n}x_{n} = 0$ can only equal the zero vector when $\lambda_{1} + ... + \lambda_{n} = 0$. An equivalent characterization of affine independence is that the $(n-1)$-families $(x_{1}-x_{i},...,x_{i-1}-x_{i},x_{i+1}-x_{i},...,x_{n}-x_{i})$ are linearly independent. We want to prove that for $\bar{x_{i}}=(1,\alpha_{1i},...,\alpha_{di})$, the $n$-family $(\bar{x}_{1},...,\bar{x}_{n})$ of vectors from $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ is linearly independent.",['linear-algebra']
83521,"A function $f\in C([0,1])$ with certain properties","Let $f\in C([0,1])$ be differentiable on $(0,1)$. Suppose that $f(0)=f(1)=0$ and that there is an $x_0\in(0,1)$ where $f(x_0)=1$. I have to prove that there is a $c\in(0,1)$ satisfying $|f^\prime(c)|>2$. This is what I have done: $f(x)=\int^x_0f^\prime(t)dt=-\int^1_xf^\prime(t)dt$. Now suppose in the seek of a contradiction that $|f^\prime(x)|\leq2$ for every $x\in(0,1)$. Then we have $|f(x)|\leq\int^x_0|f^\prime(t)|dt\leq 2x$ and $|f(x)|\leq\int^1_x|f^\prime(t)|dt\leq 2(1-x)$. And so $|f(x)|\leq\mathrm{min}\{2x,2(1-x)\}$. Evaluating this inequality in $x_0$ we obtain $1\leq2\mathrm{min}\{x_0,1-x_0\}$ and this is a contradiction if $x_0\neq1/2$. Now, if $x_0=1/2$ we can easily reduce to the case $|f(x)|<1$ if $x\neq1/2$. But I can't continue the proof in this case. Could you help me ,please?","['functions', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

83530,"If $X$ is an order topology and $Y \subset X$ is closed, do the subspace topology and order topology on $Y$ coincide?","Let $(X,<)$ be a linearly ordered set and give $X$ its order topology. Suppose that $Y \subset X$. There are 2 sensible ways to topologise $Y$: View $Y$ as a subspace of $X$ and give it the corresponding subspace topology $\tau_\text{ss}$. View $Y$ as a suborder of $X$ and give it the corresponding order topology $\tau_\text{ord}$. In general, $\tau_\text{ss}$ is finer than $\tau_\text{ord}$, or equivalently, the identity map $(Y,\tau_\text{ss}) \to (Y,\tau_\text{ord})$ is continuous. It is sometimes the case that $\tau_\text{ss} = \tau_{ord}$. For example, if $\tau_\text{ss}$ is compact, then the above identity map is a continuous bijection from a compact space onto a Hausdorff space, hence a homeomorphism. I would like to know what happens if we only assume $Y$ is closed in $X$. For locally compact $X$, the above would seem to show $Y$ closed implies $\tau_\text{ord} = \tau_\text{ss}$.

83585,somewhere between sub-gaussian and central limit theorem,"(problem statement revamped.) Definition :
A random variable $X$ is a sub-gaussian if $$\Pr(|X|>t) \leq \exp(-t^2/k^2) \quad \text{for all $t\geq 0$ and for some constant $k$.}$$ I want to compute trace of a matrix by Monte Carlo simulation. For example, in lattice Quantum Chromodynamics, we need to compute the trace of a function of a large matrix, trace($f(\mathbf{A}')$) where explicit computation of $f(\mathbf{A}')$ is impractical but computing $\mathbf{x}f(\mathbf{A}')\mathbf{x}^T$ is feasible. For simplicity, let's say the quadratic form is $\mathbf{x}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}^T$. One standard approach is Monte Carlo simulation where the trace is estimated by $X=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M\mathbf{x}_i\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i^T$ where each entry in $\mathbf{x}_i$ is sampled from $N(0,1)$ independently. I know that $X$ is sharply concentrated around $E(X) = tr(\mathbf{A})$, and $X$ is sub-gaussian, to be precise. One standard way to show that a random variable is sharply concentrated around the mean is $(\epsilon,\delta)$-approximation of tail bound.
$$\Pr(|X - E(x)|>\epsilon)<\delta$$
which can be easily computed from the definition of sub-gaussian in my problem. And this tells us how many samples $M$ are required to guarantees $(\epsilon,\delta)$-approximation. Meanwhile, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that $\sqrt{M}(X- E(x))$ converges in distribution to $N(0, \sigma^2)$, which is sharply concentrated around the shifted mean 0.
 Even though it requires $M\to\infty$, it tells us the exact probability distribution of $X$. Maybe it's not a correct interpretation, but it seems to me that these two are the exact opposite of the spectrum. Sub-gaussian: a finite number of samples, but $(\epsilon,\delta)$-approximation CLT : number of samples $\to\infty$, but exact probability distribution. Let's say I have two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ which differ at only one entry. I ran Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the value $X=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \mathbf{x}_i\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_i^T$ and $Y=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \mathbf{y}_i\mathbf{B}\mathbf{y}_i^T$ where each entry in $\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is independently sampled from $N(0,1)$. Question : Is there anyway to point-wise compare the probability distribution functions of $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ to show that 
$$\exp(-\alpha)f_Y(t) \leq f_X(t) \leq \exp(\alpha)f_Y(t)$$
with probability at least $1 − \beta$ over $t$ drawn from the range of $X$ or $Y$? This kind of inequality may seem odd, but it's used in some recent papers. For example, let's say $X$ is sampled from a Laplace distribution with density function 
$$h(x)=\frac{1}{2b}\exp(-|x|/b)$$ and compare it to Y which is sampled from a shifted Laplace distribution with density function
$$h(x+\delta)=\frac{1}{2b}\exp(-|x+\delta|/b).$$
Then the ratio $h(x)/h(x+\delta)\leq \exp(|\delta|/b)$ where I can show that $$h(x) \leq \exp(|\delta|/b)h(x)$$
for the entire domain of $X$. In case that the random variable is sampled from a standard Gaussian with density function $$g(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-\frac{x^2}{2}),$$ the picture is slightly nuanced: we can show that $g(x)/g(x+\delta)$ is bounded in the region of $|x|\leq \xi$ where $\xi$ depends on $\delta$. This results in $(\alpha,\beta)$ approximation. This inequality may look too strong, but it's based on the intuition that sub-gaussian random variables must be sharply concentrated around the mean, and subgaussian ranodm variable is a generalization of Gaussian random variable. Is there any way to do that, or is my conjectured inequality too strong?",['probability-theory']
83610,Is invertibility a stalk-local property?,"Given a locally ringed space $(X,\mathcal O_X)$ and a global section $s\in \Gamma (X,\mathcal O_X)$, which does not vanish at any point $x\in X$, meaning the image of $s$ in the stalk $\mathcal O_{X,x}$ does not belong to the maximal ideal of the local ring $\mathcal O_{X,x}$, does it mean that $s$ is invertible as an element of the ring $\Gamma (X,\mathcal O_X)$? In other words, if $s$ is invertible stalk-locally, does it mean that $s$ is invertible? It is easy to see that if $s$ is locally-invertible in the usual sense, then it is invertible, since the uniqueness of the inverse guarantees that the local inverses can be patched together. It is also easy to see that for schemes, the answer is yes, since for an affine scheme this follows from the fact that an element of a ring that does not belong to any prime (or maximal for that matter) ideal is invertible.

So I have $\pi : X \rightarrow Y$ surjective with Y being the quotient of X.
