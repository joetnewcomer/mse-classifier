851932,Finding tight upper/lower bounds for $\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{1+X^{2}}]$ where $X$ is a RV with $\mathbb{E}[X]=0$ and $\mbox{Var}(X)=\nu<\infty $,"The question is pretty much in the title. My first thought was using Jensen's inquality to get some sort of lower bound. Since $\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}$
  is convex on $\mathbb{R}\backslash\left[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right]$
  I think by Jensen's inequality I get a lower bound of the form: $$\frac{1}{1+\nu}\leq\frac{1}{1+\mathbb{E}\left[\left(X\cdot1_{\left\{ X>\frac{1}{2}\right\} }\right)^{2}\right]}\leq\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{1+\left(X\cdot1_{\left\{ X>\frac{1}{2}\right\} }\right)^{2}}\right]\leq\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{1+X^{2}}\right]
 $$
 I'm not sure if it's even correct to use Jensen's inequality in this manner, the formulation of the inequality I'm familiar with is for an integrable RV and a convex function over an interval of the form $\left(a,b\right)$
  with $a,b$
  possibly being $\pm\infty$. EDIT : like a comment suggested it's not hard to apply Jensen's Inequality correctly to obtain the second inequality. Unfortunately I just noticed the third inequality is incorrect since $$\frac{1}{1+\left(X\cdot1_{\left\{ X\geq\frac{1}{2}\right\} }\right)^{2}}\geq\frac{1}{1+X^{2}} $$ Yet the bound itself still feels like it should be correct. I also verified you can approach it as desired with a uniform RV defined on the interval $\left(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon\right)$ as $\varepsilon$ tends to $0$. As can be seen:
$$\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{1+X^{2}}\right]=\int\limits _{-\varepsilon}^{\varepsilon}\frac{1}{2\varepsilon}\cdot\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}dx=\frac{\tan^{-1}\left(\varepsilon\right)}{\varepsilon}\overset{\varepsilon\to0}{\longrightarrow}1$$
$$\frac{1}{1+\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2}\right]}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{3}}\overset{\varepsilon\to0}{\longrightarrow}1$$
I'd appreciate help showing a bound of the form $\frac{1}{1+\nu}\leq\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{1+X^{2}}\right]$ indeed holds (or a contradicting example and an alternative bound).","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'random-variables', 'expectation']"

851960,Is this an immediate consequence of the Straddle Lemma?,"As main book, I'm using Bartle, Introduction to Real Analysis (2011 4 ed) . Exercise 17 Section 6.1, p 171 asks you to prove the Straddle Lemma: Let $f:I\rightarrow\mathbb R$ be differentiable at $c\in I$ . Establish the Straddle Lemma : Given $\varepsilon >0 $ there exists $\delta >0$ such that if $u, v\in I$ satisfy $c-\delta \lt u\leq c\leq v\lt c+\delta$ then we have $|f(v)-f(u)-(v-u)f'(c)|\leq \varepsilon (v-u).$ [Hint: The $\delta$ is given by Definition 6.1.1. Subtract and add the term $f(c) - cf'(c)$ on the left side and use the Triangle Inequality.] It is sufficient to know the formal definition of derivative to prove this result. Later, in exercise 18 of section 6.2, p 180 (that is based on the Mean Value Theorem and some of its consequences) asks Let $I:=[a,b]$ and let $f:I\rightarrow\mathbb R$ be differentiable at $c\in I$ . Show that for every $\varepsilon >0 $ there exists $\delta >0$ such that if $\;0<|x-y|\lt \delta$ and $a \leq x \leq c \leq y \leq b$ , then $$\left|\frac {f(x)-f(y)}{x-y}-f'(c)\right|\lt \varepsilon$$ Is this a direct consequence of the Straddle Lemma? I didn't get to anything keeping distance from the Straddle Lemma and trying to use the Mean Value Theorem. I'm unsure about using the Straddle Lemma firstly because it gives me a not strict inequality and the second exercise has a strict inequality, and secondly because I'm not using any ""tools"" provided from the respective section. Is the Straddle Lemma useful? If so, how can I end up with a strict inequality? If not, any hints would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
851962,Homogeneous groups,"Let's call a group $G$ homogeneous if for every two distinct, non-identity elements $a$ and $b$ there is an automorphism $\phi$ of $G$ such that $\phi(a)=b$. Examining this definition, we can see that the underlying additive group of any field (indeed, any division ring) is homogeneous by examining the automorphism $\phi(x)=ba^{-1}x$. Thus for any $n$ and any prime $p$, we have that $Z_p^n$ is homogeneous. Conversely, if we also know that $G$ is finite, we can show that $G$ is of the form $Z_p^n$ for some $n$ and $p$. We can clearly see that all elements of a homogeneous group have the same order. And by Cauchy's theorem, we get that $G$ must have prime-power order. Say $|G|=p^n$. The Conjugacy Class Equation then implies that $G$ has non-trivial center. And since $G$ is homogeneous, all elements are in the center and thus $G$ is abelian. Since $G$ is finite, abelian, and all elements have the same order, we can conclude that $G$ is isomorphic to $Z_p^n$. If it weren't the fundamental theorem of abelian groups would imply there were an element of order $p^i$ for $i>1$ contradicting the fact that all elements have the same order (Cauchy's theorem still implies there's an element of order $p$). Thus finite, homogeneous groups are kind of boring. Infinite examples are more interesting as we can garner a couple examples just from fields, and they are more difficult to investigate. We can still surmise a couple things when $G$ is infinite. For example, if $G$ has a single non-identity element of finite order then all (non-identity) elements of $G$ have prime order. Let $x\neq e$ have finite order $n$. Let $n=p^em$ for some prime $p$ with $e\geq 1$ and $p\nmid m$. Then the element $x^{p^{e-1}m}$ has order $p$, and thus all elements have order $p$. Also, in general, If $G$ has a non-trivial center then it is abelian. Any quotient by a characteristic subgroup is also homogeneous. I am having difficulty figuring out other, even basic, things though. My question is kind of general: What else can we determine about homogeneous groups? I am specifically interested in these questions: Does $G$ have to be abelian? If not, can $G$ be perfect? Can $G$ be free? It clearly can't have rank 1, but what about other ranks? If all elements have prime order, is $G$ a direct sum of multiple copies of $Z_p$? But any addition is welcome and appreciated. -UPDATE Qiaochu Yuan has deftly answered three of my original questions, but one still remains though it may be difficult. However his answer has left me intrigued for a proof of the following claim: Every abelian, homogenous group is the underlying additive group of some field. I don't see how you could construct the multiplication operation, but it seems the choice for which element would become unity is a free choice.","['infinite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
851968,number of Lattice paths from origin to diagonal after removing vertices,"i am stuck with the following problem:
consider the quarter plane $\mathbb{N}_0^2$ with vertices $(i,j)\in\mathbb{N}_0^d$ and edges from each vertex $(i,j)$ to $(i+1,j)$ and $(i,j+1)$, i.e. one ""right"" edge and one ""up"" edge. Now you can turn each vertex off or on. How many different possibilites are there such that 
$i\in\{1,2,\ldots,\frac{(N+1)(N+2)}{2}-1\}$ vertices are turned off and there is no path from the origin to the diagonal $(n,k)$ satisfying $n+k=N\in\mathbb{N}$ left? I figured that with $N=2$ you have $5$ vertices and the number of possibilities turning $i$ vertices off and having no path left is $(0,0,1,6,5,1)$, i.e. turning off none or one there is always a path left, turning two off there is one possibility that no path is left, turning three off there are 6 possibilites and so on. For $N=3$ there are 9 vertices and I calculated the number as $(0,0,1,10,45,x,76,36,9,1)$ where x is unknown. So it seems that the corresponding coefficients of the pascal triangle are added up, i.e. 1,9,36. However, I am not experienced in combinatorics and have no clue how to get a general formula.

\begin{aligned}
a & \in \mathbb{C}\\

\end{aligned} Solving one integral, I can get the other through the relation
$$I_2 = \frac{d I_1}{da}.$$ My approach I can not get an answer out of Mathematica. Below are some of the approaches I tried. a) Integration by parts I can simplify the integrand enormously by taking the derivative of Erfi, which can be done by integration of parts. I know that the definite integral $\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{a/z^2-z^2}z^n dz$ is related to the Bessel functions, but I need the indefinite integral when doing partial integration, which I can not find. b) Using a known integral I know that
\begin{aligned}
\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}e^{1/x^2 -b^2x^2}\text{Erfc}(\frac{1}{x})dx & = \frac{1}{b\sqrt{\pi}}\left[\sin(2b\cdot\text{Ci}(2b))-\cos(2b\cdot\text{si}(2b))\right] \\
\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}e^{1/x^2 -b^2x^2}\text{Erfc}(\frac{1}{x})xdx & = \frac{\pi}{2b}\left[H_1(2b) - Y_1(2b)-\frac{1}{b}\right], \quad |\text{arg}\,b| < \frac{\pi}{4} \\
\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}e^{1/x^2 -b^2x^2}\text{Erfc}(\frac{1}{x})\frac{dx}{x} & = \frac{\pi}{2}\left[H_0(2b) - Y_0(2b)\right], \quad |\text{arg}\,b| < \frac{\pi}{4} \\
\end{aligned}
where Ci and si are the Cosine and Sine integrals, and $H$ is the Struve function. What I try to do is to make the variable substitution $z\to\frac{1}{z}$, then to turn Erfi into Erf (and Erfc) with the same argument as in the above equation $z \to \frac{iz}{\sqrt{2}}$. I can not figure out the limits however when doing this last substitution. c) Rewriting the integrand I can rewrite the integrals as
\begin{aligned}
I_1 & = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} e^{a(1/x - x)}\text{Erfi}(\sqrt{\sqrt{a}x/2}) dx\\
I_2 & = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x}e^{a(1/x - x)}\text{Erfi}(\sqrt{\sqrt{a}x/2}) dx.

852096,Does the median tend to the lower limit of the median class?,"The median for a continous distribution is given by $M= L +\dfrac{(N/2-C)\cdot I}{f}$ where $M$ is median, $L$ is lower limit of median class, $N$ is the total frequency, $C$  is the cumulative frequency of class BELOW the median class, $F$ is frequency of median class, $I$ is class width. The way I see it $N/2$ is close to the medial value. $(N/2-C)$ is hence the frequency of the values in the medial class lesser than the median. You then express that as a fraction of the total class size and add it to the lower limit.
So, if there is a higher percentage of values in the $N/2$ to $C$ range, the median should tend to the lower limit of the medial, class, right?
But then, in this case, $(N/2-C)$ is high, so the median will tend to the upper limit, which is not right.
Where is the mistake?

The problem is the following: $N$ teams play a round-robin tournament, i.e. each pair of teams plays exactly one game and the winner gets 3 points, the loser gets 0 points, and both teams get 1 point in case of a draw. Q1: What is the minimum score the 1st place can get? Q2: What is the maximum score the last place can get? I started tackling this problem by brute-force calculations and the results were that the minimum score for the first place is achieved when all games result in a draw, therefore the answer to the first question is $N-1$. The maximum score for the last place is achieved when all the teams have won exactly half of their matches and lost in the other half (if $N$ is even, then each team plays exactly one draw).

852386,Confused about the possibility of different differentiable structures.,"In Loring Tu's ""An Introduction to Manifolds"" an atlas on a manifold is a collection of coordinate charts that are pairwise compatible and cover the manifold. A smooth manifold is defined to be a topological manifold together with a maximal atlas or differentiable structure. The maximal atlas is constructed by taking an atlas and appending all coordinate charts that are compatible with the atlas and using this he shows that any atlas on a locally Euclidean space is contained in a unique maximal atlas. He also later shows that for any chart on a manifold, the coordinate map is a diffeomorphism onto it's image. My question arises when Tu mentions in an aside that every compact topological manifold in dimension four or higher has a finite number of differentiable structures. What I don't understand is how it is possible for a smooth manifold to have more than one differentiable structure. Doesn't the fact that for any chart the coordinate map being a diffeomorphism coupled with the fact that composition of smooth functions is smooth mean that any two coordinate charts on a manifold are compatible and thus they must all belong to one maximal atlas?

$M = \dfrac{-1}{f'(x)}$ = $\dfrac{x^4 + 2x^2 + 1}{4x}$. The segment that pass through the origin with the angular coeficient $M$ is: $g(x) = M * (x - x0) + y0$; to $x0$ = 0 and $y0$ = 0. So, $g(x) = \dfrac{x^4 + 2x^2 + 1}{4}$ Finally to get the common points between $g(x)$ and $f(x)$, I have the equality: $f(x) = g(x)$. $\dfrac{x^4 + 2x^2 + 1}{4}$ = $\dfrac{2}{x^2 + 1}$ Resulting in two real solutions: $x = -1$ and $x = 1$ and another four complex roots.

852678,Known methods to detect coordinate singularities?,"MOTIVATION In Riemannian geometry, when one writes the metric tensor in a particular coordinate system, certain 'fake' singularities might appear that have little to do with the geometry near them. For instance, on the sphere $S^2$, one has (with appropriate labelling) $$ds^2 = d\phi^2 + \sin^2(\phi)d\theta^2$$ and so it looks as though the spherical metric is singular at $\phi = 0$ or $\phi = \pi/2$, but we know it is actually not. However, the only reason we know this is because we have other descriptions of this metric that are evidently not singular anywhere. SETUP Suppose you have a smooth manifold (let's say three-dimensional) $M$ and you are given a 
local description of a metric $$ds^2 = g_{ij}dx^idx^j$$ on a coordinate patch $U \subseteq M$. If you want, you can assume this $U$ is dense in $M$, like in the sphere. Suppose that the metric looks singular near the points in $M\backslash{}U$. Here, I mean the same type of singularity as in the sphere, that is, some crucial terms $g_{ij}$ vanish when you go away from $U$, so that the matrix $[g_{ij}]$ would have zero determinant. Question : What are the known methods for not just detecting, but actually proving that the metric is not singular and therefore can be extended to the whole $M$?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

852951,Deck transformation acting properly discontinuously assumed covering space is path-connected,"Let $p:E\rightarrow X$ be a covering space, $x\in X$ fixed point, $E$ path-connected and $\Delta(p)$ – Deck transformation group of $p$, that is $\Delta(p) = \{f\in \text{Homeo}(E):pf=p\}$. Let $\pi_1(X,x)$ be  a fundamental group, and it acts on $E$ from right in the following way: $(e, [w]) \mapsto \bar{w}(1)$, where $w:[0,1]\rightarrow X$ is a representative path of $[w]$ and $\bar{w}:[0,1]\rightarrow E$ is the (unique) path lift. You might be familiar with this construction if you recall Hatcher's. The problem is: Given all above, prove that $\Delta(p)$ acts properly discontinuously on $E$. Properly discontinuous action is a group action $G\times X \rightarrow X$ such that $\forall x\in X \,\,\exists \text{ neighborhood} \,U \,\text{of}\, x : \forall g\neq 1 \in G$ holds $ g(U)\cap U = \varnothing$. So roughly speaking it means that a deck transformation has no fixed points, or ""areas"" (neighborhoods) in this context, unless its identity. In the first part of the exercise I proved that $f(e\cdot[w]) = f(e)\cdot[w]$. Actually it's not necessary to prove this for the whole $E$, I guess it will be enough to show this only for preimage $p^{-1}(x)$, whence $\pi_1(X,x)$ was introduced. What appears an obstacle for me is the whole deal with neighborhoods. For instance, if we had found a non-identity homeomorphism from $\Delta(p)$ with a  fixed point $f(x)=x$ (which for me appears a natural interpretation of properly discontinuous map, but it's more general in the definition), then we'd be done because of 1., path-connectedness of $E$ and application of path lifting theorem (this map would be an identity). If we try to prove this by contradiction then we only get a point whose each neighborhood and image of the neighborhood under some image $f$ share at least one point. Because of 1. it applies for all points, but it neither proves that $f$ is identity nor contradicts with the assumptions. So this is where I'm stuck. I guess path lifting theorem should be used at some point. Just a guess. Help appreciated. Thanks in advance!","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"
852961,Classical tensor analysis and Tensors on Manifolds,"I learned tensors the bad way (Cartesian first, then curvilinear coordinate systems assuming a Euclidean background) and realize that I am in very bad shape trying to (finally) learn tensors on manifolds. In particular, I am struggling to understand which properties of ""classical"" tensor algebra / analysis carry over into tensors on manifolds. By ""classical"" I mean the the one that assumes a background 3D Euclidean space and allows general curvilinear coordinate systems in it. 1) For instance, I have seen equations of the following sort in physics-type books 
$$
\mathbf{v} = v^i \mathbf{e_i} = v_i \mathbf{e^{*i}}
$$
The argument is that if a non-degenerate metric tensor exists, it also has an inverse, i.e.
$$
g^{ij} \equiv g_{ij}^{-1} \text{ and } g_{ij} g^{jk} \equiv \delta_i^k\\
v^i \equiv g^{ij} v_j
$$
and thus $v_j$ are the ""covariant"" components of the vector $\mathbf{v}$. My question is: Can the equation
$$
\mathbf{v} = v^i \mathbf{e_i} = v_i \mathbf{e^{*i}}
$$
be made meaningful for tensors (at each point) on a manifold by proceeding in a similar way? I suspect yes but I am not sure. One could introduce a (0,2) metric tensor on the manifold. But is its ""inverse"" automatically a (2,0) tensor as in the ""classical"" case? Also, which metric? I understand they are not unique? 3) Is there some good resource (a book perhaps) which clearly helps one to transition to tensors on manifolds?

Clearly $n_q$ can't be $r$, so at the very least there are $p$ Sylow $q$-groups, and therefore at least $(q-1)p$ elements of order $q$.  Since $p > q > r$, $p$ and $q$ must be odd primes, and therefore $p = q + k$ with $k \geq 2$.  Thus $$(q-1)p = (q-1)(q+k) = q^2 + kq - q + k \geq q^2 + 2q - q + 2 > q^2$$ (iii) If $n_r, n_p,$ or $n_q = 1$ we are done.  So assume all of these numbers are $> 1$.  By parts (i) and (ii) we can find at least $pqr - qr$ elements of order $p$, and $q^2$ elements of order $q$. The elements which do not have order $p$ or $q$ must be numbered $|G| - (pqr - qr) - q^2 = qr - q^2 = q(r-q)$ or less.  But this number is negative, contradiction.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'normal-subgroups']"

853344,"If $h$ is closer to $f$ than to $g$, its integral on $\{f > g\}$ must ""agree"" with $f$'s?","I have the following question (a result I would like to prove, with an admirable record of failing at it so far) -- I actually do not know if it is obvious or just plain wrong. Let $f,g,h\colon [0,1]\to\mathbb{R}_+$ be 3 (integrable) functions such that $\int_{[0,1]}f=\int_{[0,1]}g=\int_{[0,1]}h=1$; set $$A_{fg}\stackrel{\rm def}{=}\left\{x\in[0,1]\mid f(x) > g(x)\right\}$$
and write $\omega_f=\int_{A_{fg}} f$, $\omega_g=\int_{A_{fg}} g$, $\omega_h=\int_{A_{fg}} h$. Suppose $\int_{[0,1]} \lvert g - h\rvert \geq \int_{[0,1]} \lvert f - h\rvert + \gamma$, for some constant $\gamma > 0$. Can we prove a quantitative bound on $\omega_h$, namely that it must be ""closer to $\omega_f$ than to $\omega_g$?"". I hope that a statement of this form holds: There exists an absolute constant $c>0$ (e.g., $1/10$) such that $\omega_h > \frac{\omega_f+\omega_g}{2}+c\cdot\gamma$. It does sound ""intuitive"" to me, yet I have learnt not to give too much credit to my intuition. Especially since I have been struggling with this for one day now, and quite a few sheets of paper: I know how to prove it with the extra assumption that $\int_{[0,1]} \lvert f - h\rvert \leq \frac{\gamma}{10}$, but this is not enough for my purpose. Small note: one can assume without loss of generality $f,g,h$ to be ""regular enough"" (continuous, for instance).","['definite-integrals', 'functional-analysis']"
853354,Stronger version of AMM problem 11145 (April 2005)?,"How to show that for $a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n >0$ real numbers and for $n \ge 3$: $$\sum_{k=1}^{n}\dfrac{k}{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{k}}\le\left(2-\dfrac{7\ln{2}}{8\ln{n}}\right)\sum_{k=1}^{n}\dfrac{1}{a_{k}}$$ This version seems stronger than the inequality mentioned here . Addition: A sister problem : For $a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n >0$ real numbers and for $n \ge 2$, we have the version: $$\displaystyle \dfrac{1}{1+a_{1}}+\dfrac{1}{1+a_{1}+a_{2}}+\cdots+\dfrac{1}{1+a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}} \le \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{a_{1}}+\dfrac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\dfrac{1}{a_{n}}}$$ The stronger vesrion claims that: For each $n$, $c_n = \left(1-\dfrac{\ln{n}}{2n}\right)$ we have:
$$\displaystyle \dfrac{1}{1+a_{1}}+\dfrac{1}{1+a_{1}+a_{2}}+\cdots+\dfrac{1}{1+a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}} \le c_n\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{a_{1}}+\dfrac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\dfrac{1}{a_{n}}}$$","['inequality', 'real-analysis']"

853398,On proving an identity given a system of trig equations,"We are given the following: $$a^2 + b^2 + 2ab\cos\theta = 1 \tag1$$ $$d^2 + c^2 + 2cd\cos\theta = 1 \tag2$$ $$ac + bd + (ad + bc)\cos\theta = 0\tag3$$ It is required to prove that: $$a^2 + c^2 = \csc^2\theta$$ $$b^2 + d^2 = \csc^2\theta$$ I right away noticed that this problem didn't change if we replaced $a, b$ with $c, d$ respectively. This suggested a that a reduction of the problem might be possible, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I then noticed that the first two equations represented the magnitude of the vector sum of the vectors $a, b$ and $c, d$. But again, this was not very helpful, as I couldn't relate the third equation to the problem. I lastly tried to specialize the problem to a special case, hoping it would yield some useful insight. For instance, if $\cos\theta = 0$, the equations reduces to: $$a^2 + b^2 = 1 \tag4$$ $$d^2 + c^2 = 1\tag5$$ $$ac + bd = 0\tag6$$ and we are required to prove:: $$a^2 + c^2 = b^2 + d^2 = 1$$ this can be immediately seen if we solve $(6)$ for $a$ and then substitute in $(4)$ getting, $b = c$. This however, did not give me any insight into solving the problem. In general, I have a lot of trouble figuring out how to relate the hypothesis given in such (algebraic) problems to the conclusion. Most of the time, I just keep transforming the equations aimlessly until I stumble upon the conclusion. I would prefer a solution with the motivation behind it, and also, if possible, some general tips on approaching such problems.","['trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus']"
853406,Question about Riemann Mapping theorem,"The Riemann mapping theorem says that given a simply connected region R not all off $\mathbb{C}$ and $z_0 \in R$ then there is a unique conformal map $f: R \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ such that $f(z_0) = 0$ and $f'(z_0) > 0$.  What I am unclear about is what exactly the uniqueness statement means?  Is the value $f'(z_0)$ unique?  That is, given $z_0$, is $|f'(z_0)|$ unique?  As in, there do not exist different conformal maps $f:R \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$ with $f(z_0) = 0$ and $|f'(z_0)| = 0.5$ for one map, and $0.24$ say for another?

853407,4 heads in 8 tosses,"If someone asked me the odds of getting 4 heads in 8 flips of a fair coin. I would initially think to do something like this: $\dfrac{2^8 - \left( \binom{8}{0} + \binom{8}{1} + \binom{8}{2} + \binom{8}{3} \right)}{2^8} = \dfrac{163}{256} \simeq 63.67\%$ In that there's $2^8$ total different outcomes of 8 flips, and of those (in the numerator) I subtract out the outcomes that have 0 heads, 1 heads, 2 heads, or 3 heads.  (Or equivalently, I could have subtracted out those with 8, 7, 6, or 5 tails). However, I think this is more like asking ""getting at least 4 heads in 8 fair flips""?  I assume if you were tossing these as soon as you hit 4 heads you'd be in a ""win"" state, so it wouldn't matter if the rest of the flips would result in greater than 4 heads for that particular outcome? However, suppose that as soon as 4 heads were obtained, the flips would stop, so it would not be possible to get greater than 4 heads in any outcome. So wouldn't that mean the total outcomes would be less? Either 0 heads happen, 1 heads, 2 heads, 3 heads, or 4 heads: $\binom{8}{0} + \binom{8}{1} + \binom{8}{2} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{8}{4} = 163 $ Then, I only care about those that have 4 heads: $\dfrac{\binom{8}{4}}{163} = \dfrac{70}{163} \simeq 42.94\%$ So why are the probabilities different?
