1859082,Intuition of the relation between poisson process and order statistics,"Lemma: Let $T_n$ be the time of the nth arrival in a Poisson process and $U_k$, $k=1,2....n$ be independent uniform on $(0,1)$.

1859086,A question on the non trivial rank three bundle on $S^2$,"We know that number of rank $3$ vector bundles on $S^2$ is just the number of equivalence classes of maps from $S^1$ to $SO(3)$. This implies that there is one and only one non trivial vector bundle on $S^2$. Also we know that this rank $3$ vector bundle can be written as a whitney sum of a rank $2$ and trivial line bundle. Now I was wondering which rank $2$ vector bundles on $S^2$ when added to a trivial line bundle yield the non trivial bundle. My try: There are an integer number of rank $2$ vector bundles. We know the trivial bundle and the tangent bundle do not give a non trivial bundle. Also I calculated the clutching function for the tangent bundle, I got it as $z \to z^2$ after doing the identification of $SO(2)$ with $S^1$. So I am guessing that all odd degree clutching functions give a non trivial bundle and the even ones give a trivial bundle. I am confused as to how one proves this.

1859116,Geometric interpretation of a hollow symmetrical 3D matrix,"Any matrix $A$ can be presented as a sum of its symmetrical and skew-symmetrical part: $A=sym(A)+skew(A)$. Decomposition can go further and we can present symmetrical part as a sum of some diagonal matrix and hollow (zeros on diagonal) symmetrical matrix. Now we have (used below notation is only for the needs of this question) $A= diag(A)+hols(A)+ skew(A)$. Let's assume the dimension of $A$ is $3$. In this case we have the sum of   $3$ components where every component has $3$ DOF (decoded in three 3D vectors). We can also present these components in the form $A= k_d{diag_n}(A )+k_h{hols_n}(A )+ k_s{skew_n}(A )$, where coefficients $k_d, k_h, k_s$ are  calculated so to assure that vectors which represent DOF of components are unit vectors , index $n$ denotes here this kind of ""normalization""
 (so in these unit vectors we have decoded 2 degrees of freedom and additional DOF is in the appropriate scaling coefficient $k_{\{d,h,s)\}}$) Example of such decomposition: $\begin{bmatrix}  
1 & 3 & 5 \\
1 & 4 & 4 \\
1 & 8 & 8
\end{bmatrix}$ = 
9$\begin{bmatrix}  
\dfrac{1}{9} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \dfrac{4}{9} & 0 \\
0 &0 & \dfrac{8}{9}

7$\begin{bmatrix}  
0 & \dfrac{2}{7} & \dfrac{3}{7} \\

-\dfrac{1}{3} & 0 & -\dfrac{2}{3} \\

\end{bmatrix}$ Two of components have distinct geometric interpretation: $diag(A)$ is simply a scaling matrix and $skew(A)$ is a scaled composition of a projection and  rotation by $\pi/2$ (See question*) . However the geometric interpretation for the $hols_n(A)$ is unknown to me.. In the general case matrix  $hols(A)$ has a form $\begin{bmatrix}  
0 & a & b \\
a & 0 & c \\
b & c & 0
\end{bmatrix}$ Some properties of this matrix    maybe  provide some information about its nature: it has real eigenvalues (as a special case of symmetric matrix) so
rotation probably can't be engaged for this interpretation (unless it
is by $\pi$) determinant of this matrix  $det(hols(A))= 2abc$ so its rank $=3$      if $ a,b,c \neq 0$. If one of $a,b,c=$ $0$ its rank decreases ( unlike $skew_n(A)$ where zeroing a single entry (and its skew-symmetrical one) doesn't change geometric interpretation - only axis of rotation which determines at the same time the direction of projection ). few others  are in Wikipedia . So my question is: Could   hollow symmetrical matrix $hols_n(A)$ be decomposed in such a way that geometric    interpretation of $hols_n(A)$ would be explicit ? If geometric interpretation of the hollow matrix is too difficult one can propose other method for decomposition of symmetrical part $sym(A)$ only on condition that both parts should have 3 DOF and each part should have explicit geometric interpretation..","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

1859160,Lebesgue integration by substitution,"I read that, if $f\in L^1[c,d]$ is a Lebesgue summable function on $[a,b]$ and $g:[a,b]\to[c,d]$ is invertible and such that $g\in C^1[a,b]$ and $g^{-1}\in C^1[a,b]$, then $$\int_\limits{g([a,b])}f(x)\,d\mu_x=\int_\limits{[a,b]}f(g(t))|g'(t)|\,d\mu_t$$where $\mu$ is the linear Lebesgue measure. I know that the function $F$ defined by $$F(x):=\int_\limits{[c,x]}f(\xi)\,d\mu_{\xi}$$is absolutely continuous, and that the derivative $\varphi$ of an absolutely continuous function $\Phi:[c,d]\to\mathbb{R}$, which exists almost everywhere on $[c,d]$, is such that $$\int_\limits{[c,d]}\varphi(\xi) \,d\mu_{\xi}=\Phi(d)-\Phi(c)$$but I cannot use these two facts alone to prove the desired result.

1859176,Argument of a composite trigonometric function,"While dealing with trigonometric functions, we usually assume the argument to be in radians. The operator then returns a unitless output.

1859211,What is $dy/dy$?,"Say you have the following function:
$$y=x^2+x$$
Then
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=2x+1$$
However, what if you wanted to find $dy/dy$? I differentiated both sides of the original equation with respect to $y$, getting
$$\frac{d}{dy}[y]=\frac{d}{dy}[x^2+x]$$
Now, I’ve always thought that $dy/dy=1$. After all, the derivative of a variable alone with respect to that variable is 1. However, if I apply the differentiation to the RHS, I’ll find that either of the terms are affected by the differentiation. Thus, 
$$\frac{dy}{dy}=x^2+x$$
The RHS here is the original $y$, so
$$\frac{dy}{dy}=y$$
This does not suggest that $dy/dy=1$. Obviously I’m making a mistake somewhere in my reasoning above. Can someone point out where I went wrong? $dy/dy=1$, correct? It does not equal $y$?","['derivatives', 'calculus']"
1859215,Proving that $\lceil f(x) \rceil$ $=$ $\lceil f(\lceil x \rceil )\rceil$ when $f(x) =$ integer $\implies x =$ integer,"On P. 71 in 'Concrete Mathematics' the following Theorem is given: Let $f$ be any continuous, monotonically increasing function on an interval of the real numbers, with the property that
  \begin{equation}f(x) = \mathit{integer}\ \ \ \implies\ \ \ x = \mathit{integer} . \end{equation}
  Then we have \begin{equation} \lfloor f(x) \rfloor = \lfloor f(\lfloor x \rfloor )\rfloor\ \ \ \ and\ \ \ \lceil f(x) \rceil = \lceil f(\lceil x \rceil )\rceil,
\end{equation}
  whenever $f(x)$, $f(\lfloor x \rfloor)$, and $f(\lceil x \rceil)$ are defined. The proof for the second equation goes as follows: If $x = \lceil x\rceil$, there's nothing to prove. Otherwise $x < \lceil x\rceil$, and $f(x) < f(\lceil x \rceil)$ since $f$ is increasing. Hence $\lceil f(x)\rceil \leq \lceil f(\lceil x\rceil)\rceil$, since $\lceil \cdot\rceil$ is nondecreasing. If $\lceil f(x) \rceil < \lceil f(\lceil x\rceil)\rceil$, there must be a number $y$ such that $x \leq y < \lceil x\rceil$ and $f(y) = \lceil f(x)\rceil$, since $f$ is continuous. This $y$ is an integer, because of $f$'s special property. But there cannot be an integer strictly between
  $\lfloor x\rfloor$ and $\lceil x\rceil$ . This contradiction implies that we must have $\lceil f(x) \rceil = \lceil f(\lceil x \rceil )\rceil$. The part of the proof that I don't understand: If $\lceil f(x) \rceil < \lceil f(\lceil x\rceil)\rceil$, there must be a number $y$ such that $x \leq y < \lceil x\rceil$ and $f(y) = \lceil f(x)\rceil$, since $f$ is continuous.

1859263,"How do I calculate this loop spline given the length, angle and horizontal offset?","I'm developing a formula to calculate a loop spline from a length, angle and horizontal offset. I can successfully calculate the loop from the first two parameters, but taking the horizontal offset into account is over my head. I can simply add the horizontal offset, but that will make the spline longer and no longer match with the required ""length"" parameter. Assuming $\theta = angle \neq 0$ and $x \in [0,1]$, the formula I use is this $$
\begin{align}
r &= \dfrac{\dfrac{length}{2\pi}}{\dfrac{\theta}{2\pi}} = \dfrac{length}{\theta} & (1)\\[2ex]
p_x &= cos(x * \theta)*r \\
p_y &= sin(x * \theta)*r & (2)\\
p_z &= x * h_{offset}

$$ (1) Radius of a circle $r = \dfrac{C}{2\pi}$ (2) Calculating the $xyz$ coordinates of the circle in 3D space, gradually offsetting the z-coordinate with the progress of the loop spline to finally meet the horizontal offset (Disclaimer: My use of mathematical notation is probably far off from how its used properly.) This gives a nice loop spline, but unfortunately, given $h_{offset} \ne 0$, the resulting spline does not match the $length$ requirement. Example below: The spline also needs to be smoothed in the x-component (as currently there's no soft transition when traveling in z-direction and entering the loop, that is coming from the bottom of the grid from the pictures perspective). This is a function I use to smooth the $h_{offset}$ in each step, resulting in a smooth transition. $$
x \in [0,1], \ f(x) = \begin{cases}
  \dfrac{4x^2}{2} & \text{if } x < \dfrac{1}{2} \\
  1-\dfrac{4(1-x)^2}{2} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \ \ \ \ (3)
$$ $$
p_z = f(x) * h_{offset} \ \ \ (4)
$$ (3) I hope I translated the formula correctly, here 's the Python version of it
(4) New formular for computing the Z component I think that applying $f()$ to $p_x$ should also have an effect on the length of the spline, but I'm not sure how. Ultimately, my question is: How can I calculate the radius so that in the end the length of the spline matches the $length$ parameter for any given $hoffset$? I'd be happy to correctly calculate the radius for the version without smoothing out the loop with $f(x)$ as a starter. Edit#1: I've taken samples of the actual length of the spline. From the plot, it appears the length that the horizontal offset adds is marginal at first and then smoothly transitions into a linear function...? Update: June 18th So basically all I need is a way to calculate the formula that gives the above graph in order to subtract it from the input $lenght$ parameter to counteract the effect of the $h_{offset}$. I've found this formula to come relatively close to what you can see above in terms of the shape, but I haven't been able to find the exact formula, and using trial & error isn't a very sophisticated approach to the problem. $$
f(x)=\dfrac{x^2}{x+1}

1859332,Chowla's Construction of prime having least quadratic non-residue $\gg \log p$,"This paper by NC Ankeny mentions that "" S. Chowla has proved that there exist infinitely many primes $k$ where the
 first $c_1\log k$ residues $(\bmod k)$ are all quadratic residues"". I recently found a proof of this here . The proof constructs such primes using this idea: Consider numbers which satisfies these condition : $n=1\bmod 8$ and $n=1\bmod r_i$ where $r_i$ are first consecutive odd primes less than $y$. Let $R:= 8\prod r_i $ , clearly $n=1\bmod R$ by Chinese remainder theorem. By Linniks there exist a prime $p$ in this arithmetic progression $\{ 1+rk_j\}$ such that $p= \mathcal{O}(R^6)$. Note that for this prime all numbers less than $y$ are quadratic residue, since p $\equiv  1 \bmod 8 \implies \big(\frac{a}{p} \big) = \big( \frac{p}{a} \big) $. By prime number theorem it is easy to see that y = $O(\log p)$ But this analysis clearly doest rule out the possibility of having least quadratic non-residue $O(\log p)$ . Infact if we write all the constants and work it out than it doesn't even rule out the possibility of least quadratic non residue less than $10\log p$. I want to know is this just what Chowla proved or there is a better argument for this. Any refrence for the same would be of great help.","['number-theory', 'quadratic-reciprocity', 'analytic-number-theory', 'quadratic-residues']"

It is then claimed (Hartshorne III.12.3) that the map

is an isomorphism for any $A$-module $M$. Since $\otimes$ and $h^i$ commute with direct limits we reduce to $M$ finitely generated and write $$0\rightarrow R\rightarrow E\rightarrow M\rightarrow 0$$ for $E$ free f.g., $R$ the finitely-generated kernel. Since $L^{\boldsymbol\cdot}$ is a complex of free $A$-modules and $C^{\boldsymbol\cdot}$ is a complex of flat $A$-modules we get an exact, commutative diagram of complexes

Since the result holds for $i+1$ by induction, and for $E$, since $E$ is free and $h^i(L^{\boldsymbol\cdot})\rightarrow h^i(C^{\boldsymbol\cdot})$ is an isomorphism, one deduces that the five vertical arrows in the diagram above are (?,iso,?,iso,iso). It follows that the middle map is an epimorphism from one of the four-lemmas but it is concluded ('from the subtle 5-lemma') that the middle map is in fact an isomorphism.

The multi-dimensional partial integration is a special case of the divergence theorem. But the divergence theorem in the version that I know only can be applied on compact subsets $K$ of $\mathbb R^d$ with smooth boundary $\partial K$. Smooth boundary means that for all $p\in\partial K$, there is an open set $U\subseteq\mathbb R^d$ with $p\in U$ such that there is a continuously differentiable $F:U\to\mathbb R$ with $K\cap U=\left\{x\in U:F(x)\le 0\right\}$ and $F'(x)\ne 0$ for all $x\in U$ Let's so what we've got in the situation of $\phi,\psi\in C_c^\infty(\Omega)$.

The polynomial $f_{m,n,r}(q)$ counts the number of $m$-by-$n$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of rank $r$, when $q$ is a power of a prime natural number.  Since the transpose map from $\text{Mat}_{m\times n}\left(\mathbb{F}_q\right)\to\text{Mat}_{n\times m}\left(\mathbb{F}_q\right)$ is a bijection that preserves rank, we conclude that the number of $n$-by-$m$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of rank $r$ is also $f_{m,n,r}(q)$.  Ergo, $f_{m,n,r}(q)=f_{n,m,r}(q)$ whenever $q$ is a prime power, whence the equality $f_{m,n,r}(q)=f_{n,m,r}(q)$ is indeed an identity in $\mathbb{Z}[q]$.

$$
f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\mathrm{sign}\left(\sin(nx)\right)}{n}\, .

This is a bizarre and fascinating function. A few properties of this function that SEEM to be true: 1) $f(x)$ is $2\pi$-periodic and odd around $\pi$. 2) $\lim_{x\rightarrow \pi_-} f(x) = \ln 2$. (Can be proven by letting $x = \pi-\epsilon$, expanding the sine function, and taking the limit as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$.) 3) $\int_0^{\pi}dx\, f(x) = \frac{\pi^3}{8}$ (Can be ""proven"" by integrating each $\mathrm{sign}\left(\sin(nx)\right)$ term separately. Side question: Is such a procedure on this jumpy function even meaningful?) All of this despite the fact that I can't really prove that this function converges anywhere other than when $x$ is a multiple of $\pi$! A graph of this function (e.g. in Mathematica) reveals an amazing fractal shape. My question: What is the fractal dimension of the graph of this function? Does the answer depend on which definition of fractal dimension we use (box dimension, similarity dimension, ...)? This question doesn't come from anywhere other than from my desire to see if an answer exists. As requested, a plot of this function on the range $x\in[0,2\pi]$: Edited to add: Other, perhaps more immediate, questions about this function: 1) Does it converge? Conjecture: It converges whenever $x/\pi$ is irrational, but doesn't necessarily diverge if $x/\pi$ is rational. See, e.g., $x = \pi$, where it converges to zero, and apparently to $\pm \ln 2$ on either side of $x = \pi$. 2) I would guess that it diverges as $x\rightarrow 0_+$. How does it diverge there? If this really is a fractal function, I would suppose that the set of points where it diverges is dense. For instance, it appears to have a divergence at $x = 2\pi/3$. Edit 2: Another thing that's pretty straightforward to prove is that:
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow {\frac{\pi}{2}}_-} f(x) = \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\ln 2}{2}
$$
and
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow {\frac{\pi}{2}}_+} f(x) = \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{\ln 2}{2}
$$ Final Edit: I realize now that the initial question about this function - what is its fractal dimension - is (to use a technical term) very silly. There are much more immediate and relevant question, e.g. about convergence, etc. I've already selected one of the answers below as answering a number of these questions. One final point, for anyone who stumbles on this post in the future. The term $\mathrm{sign}(\sin(nx))$ is actually a square wave , and so we can use the usual Fourier series of a square wave to derive an alternate way of expressing this function:
$$
f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\mathrm{sign}\left(\sin(nx)\right)}{n}
 = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}
\frac{\sin(n(2m-1)x)}{n(2m-1)}

1859893,Origins of Differential Geometry and the Notion of Manifold,"The title can potentially lend itself to a very broad discussion, so I'll try to narrow this post down to a few specific questions.  I've been studying differential geometry and manifold theory a couple of years now.  Over this time the notion of a manifold, as some object that locally looks Euclidean though globally may not be, has become a very comfortable notion for me.  However, the definition of a (smooth) manifold is quite abstract, and it's not particularly obvious from the outset why such an object would be of importance.  The modern definition as I've come to know it, which can be found in many textbooks ( John Lee's book, or this reprint of the definiton), I'm guessing is the byproduct of a long evolution of definitions.  It's my guess that many candidate definitions were adopted and discarded until we eventually settled on the one we use today. What is the origin of our modern definition of manifold?  As succinctly as possible, what was the evolution of this definition and
  what was the original inspiration for defining such an object? What were the origins of some of the standard manifolds that are used in practice?  For instance, I'm certain that some of the objects
  that gave impetus for the definition of a manifold consisted of $\mathbb{S}^2, SO(3)$, and
  $\mathbb{T}^2$, but what are the origins of say the projective spaces
  $\mathbb{RP}^n, \mathbb{CP}^n$, as well as the Grassmann and Stiefel
  manifolds?  The role of manifolds in Hamiltonian mechanics? Are there any ""vestigial"" concepts that were at one time considered important but eventually discarded due to their
  ineffectiveness, or ones that possibly yielded contradictory results? How did the evolution of topology as a subject intermingle with that of differential geometry? What are some good books tracing the history of differential geometry (that is, the evolution of the ideas)?  I know of a few math
  history books, including Boyer's
  book ,
  but the parts about differential geometry/topology are left almost as
  afterthoughts with the main text dealing with ancient civilizations
  leading up to the calculus. This is a rather long question, and I don't expect anyone to answer each point in it's entirety.  Partial answers are welcome.","['reference-request', 'smooth-manifolds', 'soft-question', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

Exercise 4.13 in Rudin asks: Let $E$ be a dense subset of a metric space $X$, and let $f$ be a uniformly continuous real function defined on $E$. Prove that $f$ has a continuous extension from $E$ to $X$. My proof: Suppose $p \in X \setminus E$.  Then there is a sequence $\{p_n\} \to p$ in $E$, because $p$ must be a limit point of $E$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous on $E$, we have for each $\epsilon > 0$ the existence of a $\delta > 0$ such that $$d(p_n, p_m) < \delta \implies d(f(p_n), f(p_m))<\epsilon$$  However, since $\{p_n\}$ converges, it is also Cauchy so that there is some $N$ such that $$n, m \geq N \implies d(p_n, p_m) < \delta \implies d(f(p_n), f(p_m))<\epsilon$$ This statement implies that $\{f(p_n)\}$ is Cauchy.  Now since $f$ is real-valued, cauchy sequences converge and thus $\{f(p_n)\}$ converges.  Now just define $$g(p) = f(p) \text{ if } p \in E$$
$$g(p) = \lim_{n\to\infty} f(p_n) \text{ for } p \notin E, \{p_n\} \to p \text{ in } E$$ This is the desired continuous extension.($p_n$ is an arbitrary sequence in $E$ that tends to $p$)","['real-analysis', 'cauchy-sequences', 'continuity', 'uniform-continuity', 'analysis']"

The key to me seems to be that the $\Delta x $ approaches 1 but does not reach it. This allows for the best approximation $\Delta x = 1 $ at each moment. In other words, at each moment of growth the value x experiences $\Delta x = 1 + \frac1n $ , or as $n \to \infty$ ... $$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} 1 + \frac1n = 1 $$ Growth with n = 2 moments: $1 \times 1\frac12 \times 1\frac12 $ = 2.25 insight: If 2 moments of growth occur to x where $\Delta x = 1\frac12$ , this amounts to discrete growth by $\Delta x = 1\frac12$ twice. Growth with three moments: $1\times 1\frac13 \times 1\frac13 \times 1\frac13 $ = 2.35 insight: If 3 moments of growth occur to x in where $\Delta x = 1\frac13$ , this amounts to discrete growth by $\Delta x = 1\frac13$ three times. Growth at seven moments: $1\times \frac17 \times 1\frac17  \times 1\frac17 \times 1\frac17 \times 1\frac17 \times 1\frac17 \times 1\frac17 $ = 2.55 insight: If 7 moments of growth occur to x in this period where $\Delta x = 1\frac17$ , this amounts to discrete growth by $\Delta x = 1\frac17$ seven times. $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \frac1n\right)^n $ is a definition of $e$ as it models n moments of growth occurring where at each instant the initial value is scaled by a factor $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} 1 + \frac1n = 1 $ . To me this seems intuitive to a small extent. If we want to grow continuously we scale by an infinitely small increase an infinite number of times and this converges onto the number $e$ . Why it must converge is mysterious to me, and besides seeing a proof I can't intuit to something that is satisfying. Now there is also the Taylor series representation of $e$ $$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac1{n!} = 1 + 1 + \frac12 + \frac1{3\times2\times1} + \frac1{4\times3\times2\times1} ... $$ Speaking loosely it seems to get $e$ you can sum a whole and itself, with $ \frac12$ that whole, and $ \frac13$ of $ \frac12$ of that whole and so on...and I have no intuition for this. Again, the Taylor Series converges to $e$ but I don't see the same intuition for how this can model continuous growth. Furthermore, with my limited math skills I wouldn't know how to prove: $$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \frac1n\right)^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac1{n!}$$ My 3 questions I am seeking to answer are 1. By what application or intuition can it be seen that $ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac1{n!} $ models continuous growth? 2. What are some proofs that: $$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \frac1n\right)^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac1{n!}$$ 3. Is euler's number inextricably linked to time as $\pi$ is to the circle? When discussing $e$ it seems necessary to talk of periods of continuous growth $ p = kt $ being represented by $ e = e^p $ where $ p = 1 $ in the fundamental case. I do not know how to think of $e$ without seeing it as one period of continuous growth proven to be $e$ by the convergence of the intuitive definition I gave . I cannot see this same inextricable link to a period in the Taylor Series nor in other definitions of $e$ . Thanks for any comments, I have been trying to wrap my head around $e$ at the most fundamental level for a long time so that I can more deeply understand differential equations. How was it arrived upon that e best modeled continuous growth? Was it an experimental observation or was it a proof that convinced mathematicians and scientists that $e$ embodies the idea of continuous growth i.e. growth at all instances?

So I substituted $$U=\sum_{n=0}^{\lambda}C_nx^n\tag{2}$$ into $(1)$ and equated coefficients of $x^n$ to get the recursion relation:
$$C_{n+2}=\frac{(n-\lambda)}{(n+1)(n+2)}C_n$$ So I am looking to find the values of the coefficients $C_0,C_1,C_2$ for $$U=\sum_{n=0}^{3}C_nx^n=C_0+C_1x+C_2x^2+x^3$$

We can show that $\Delta\langle\phi\rangle$ has a unique extension $F\in H'$ with $$F(v)=-\langle\nabla v,\nabla\phi\rangle\;\;\;\text{for all }v\in H\;.\tag 2$$ We continue to denote $F$ by $\Delta\langle\phi\rangle$.

1860168,Uncountability of increasing functions on N,"I believe I have made a reasonable attempt to answer the following question. I would like a confirmation of my proof to be correct, or help as to why it is incorrect. Question:
Let $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be increasing if $f(n+1) \ge f(n)$ for all $n$. Is the set $A$ of functions $f$ countable or uncountable? For each $f$ in $A$, there is a function $g: \mathbb{N}\cup \{0\} \to \mathbb{N} \cup\{0\}$ defined by $g(0)=f(1)$ and $g(n)=f(n+1)-f(n)$ for $n>0$. Conversely, for each $g: \mathbb{N}\cup \{0\} \to \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ with $g(0)>0$, there is an increasing function $f$ defined recursively by $f(1)=g(0)$ and $f(n+1)=f(n)+g(n)$ for $n>0$. Consequently, there is a bijection between $A$ and the set $B$, of $g: \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\} \to \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, $g(0)>0$. If $B$ is uncountable, then $A$ must be uncountable. The set $C$ of $h: \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\} \to \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ with $h(0)=1 $is a subset of $B$. For each real $x \in [1,2)$, there is a unique decimal expansion with 1 before the decimal point, ending NOT in trailing 9's. By defining for $n>0$, $h(n)=$ (n'th digit of x after decimal point), we have an injection from $[1,2)$ to the set $C$ (different $x$ => different decimal expansions => x maps to different h). Since the set of reals on $[1,2]$ is uncountable,
the set C is uncountable,
=> the set B is uncountable,
=> the set A is uncountable.",['elementary-set-theory']

1860248,Estimating Distributed Cache Hits Based On Local Cache Hit Data,"This needs a bit of an introduction. We have 6 servers with a local cache, in other words, we have 6 different systems of cache that do not speak to each other. A request that comes through our system is assigned a concrete server in a ""Round Robin"" fashion, e.g. Req1 -> Server1, Req2 -> Server2 ... Req7 -> Server 1 . You could think of it as Server assigned = Request number % number of servers . Our cache works as follows: if one request is identical to another received in that server in the last 30 minutes, we return the previously cached response for that request. We currently have a very low hit (i.e. statistically speaking, the chances of two identical request landing in the same sever is low). More specifically, the amount of repeated requests (based on real-world recollected data) ranges between 3% and 5%. That hit probability is very low, so low that it makes no sense to maintain the code necessary to configure the cache. We are thinking of using a distributed cached, i.e. one that is shared between all servers, so cache will be server-independent. The problem is that building that system is expensive. I will like to know what is the hit probability that could be expected in order to take that step or not. Now, to the maths I am guessing that the new distributed system will have a hit probability ranging from 5% to 30%. 30% being: average hit amongst server multiplied by number of servers . However, I am not very sure of that upper limit and my statistics knowledge is a bit rusty. Is there a way to calculate with proper confidence intervals what would the distributed cache hit be? TL;DR If the probability of a request being repeated on a given server in the last 30 minutes ranges between [0.03, 0.05] . Assuming that there are six servers and that a request is assigned to a server as follows: Server assigned = request number % number of servers (Round Robin). What would the probability be if we replace all that six servers by just one which manages all the requests.","['statistics', 'statistical-inference']"

Here the W represents a win for A , L represents a loss while D represents a draw. If a character is in red, it means that it can be exchanged (rearranged) with the other characters in red. If in black, it's position is fixed. Underscores represent any value can be taken at that point. The procedure I followed is that, for zero draws, I kept adding an extra red L before the last W and still letting A win the tournament. Then I added a red D, then kept adding a red L, again letting A win the tournament. I wrote all such arrangements in this fashion and wrote the corresponding probabilities and added them together. There were 16 such rows for me. The answer i got was $651/3^7$ or $217/729$, but the answer given is $299/729$.
