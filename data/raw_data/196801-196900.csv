3793869,"USAMO $1989$, Problem $2$","Problem $2$ from USAMO, $1989$ : The $20$ members of a local tennis club have scheduled exactly $14$ two-person games among themselves, with each member playing in at least one game. Prove that within this schedule there must be a set of six games with $12$ distinct players. My attempt at a solution: Since there are $20$ players, each of whom has played at least one game, the least number of matches which must be organised to accommodate all players would be $10$ . Now, $4$ more matches are left, which can be played by at most $8$ of these $20$ players. Thus, at least $12$ of the players get to play no more than $1$ match, and hence there must exist a set of six games with $12$ distinct players . This, I believe, will be the guiding principle of a rigorous proof. I have the following doubts clouding my mind: Is my reasoning sound, i.e., free of any pitfalls? If correct, how to frame the above reasoning in a mathematically rigorous proof? Edit: As pointed out by Ben in the comments, the statement in italics is unjustified. I overlooked a lot of possibilities while framing this proof, it seems. Thus, I would like to get some hints to proceed with more reasonable proof.","['contest-math', 'recreational-mathematics', 'solution-verification', 'combinatorics']"

3793887,"Solve the ODE $(x-1)y'' - xy' + y = 1$ subject to boundary conditions $y(0)=0,y(1)=2$ using Greens function","I'm looking to solve the BVP $$(x-1)\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - x\frac{dy}{dx} + y = 1$$ subject to the conditions $y(0)=0,y(1)=2$ , firstly by getting the problem into self adjoint form and then by finding the Greens function. I think I have the self adjoint form for the problem, namely $$\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{e^{-x}}{x-1}\frac{dy}{dx}) +\frac{e^{-x}}{(x-1)^2}y=\frac{e^{-x}}{(x-1)^2}$$ where the boundary conditions remain unchanged as I have just multiplied through by a factor and then used the chain rule to simplify. Then, I have noted that $y=x$ and $y=e^x$ are solutions to the homogeneous form of the above which are linearly independent since they have non-zero Wronskian on the domain we are considering. Here I've also noted that $u=2x$ satisfies the homogeneous problem and the inhomogeneous boundary conditions, so then $\hat{y} = y - u$ is a solution to the inhomogeneous problem with the homogeneous boundary conditions (which we can find by the Greens function and use to get the solution $y$ of the problem we are considering). It is in finding the Greens function that I'm struggling, as I seem to always get a wrong answer. I wonder if my understanding of the method is wrong. Could someone provide a step by step process of how to get the Greens function in this case, and then how to get a solution from that?","['boundary-value-problem', 'self-adjoint-operators', 'greens-function', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

3793920,Lower a polytope into the water $-$ are vertices at the water level connected to those at the bottom?,"Suppose we take a convex polyope $P$ and a face $A$ with vertices $a_1,\ldots, a_n$ . We hold the polytope with $A$ flush with the surface and slowly lower it, keeping $A$ parallel to the surface thoughout. We continue lowering until the water level reaches some vertex $b_1$ not belonging to $A$ . Then let $b_1,\ldots, b_m$ be all the vertices at the water level. I wonder: Is every $b_i$ joined by an edge to some $a_i$ ? Seems physically obvious. But so do many facts about polytopes, such as the linear-inequalities/convex-hull definitions being equivalent. If you consider the part of the polytope between the water level and the plane spanned by $A$ you get a smaller polytope $Q$ . This $Q$ has all $a_i,b_j$ as vertices but might have extra vertices created when edges of $A$ pass through the water. Nevertheless all the vertices are contained in one of the two planes. This suggests the following perhaps easier question. Suppose $P_1,P_2$ are two parallel planes, and $P$ is a polytope whose every vertex is in either $P_1$ or $P_2$ . Is each vertex in $P_1$ joined by an edge to a vertex of $P_2$ ?","['polytopes', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'geometry']"

3794022,Need help minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between discrete observations and a complicated distribution.,"TL;DR: I want to fit the probability distribution $P(x) = \int_{0}^{x} N_0(z) \hspace{0.1cm} dz \int_{x}^{W} N_1(z) \hspace{0.1cm} dz$ to a bunch of discrete observations in order to obtain $N_0$ and $N_1$ which produced them. I fail at solving the following equations and need help at how to approach this: $$\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu_1} \sum_{z=0}^{x} O(x)\hspace{0.1cm} ln \left(\int_{0}^{x} \frac{1}{\sigma_1 \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_1)^2}{2\sigma_1^2}} dz \right), \hspace{0.5cm}\frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma_1} \sum_{z=0}^{x} O(x)\hspace{0.1cm} ln \left(\int_{0}^{x} \frac{1}{\sigma_1 \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_1)^2}{2\sigma_1^2}} dz \right)$$ My motivation comes from this paper: Probabilistic Object Detection: Definition and Evaluation . The authors define a probability distribution over all pixels $(u', v')$ of an image as a product of integrals of two 2D-Gaussian distributions $N_0$ and $N_1$ , which represent bounding box corners. The exact formula is: $$P(u', v') = \int \int_{0, 0}^{u', v'} N_0(u, v) \hspace{0.1cm} du \hspace{0.1cm} dv \int \int_{u', v'}^{H, W} N_1(u, v) \hspace{0.1cm} du \hspace{0.1cm} dv$$ where $H$ and $W$ are width and height of the image. This procedure allows one to get from two bounding-box gaussians to a probability distribution over all pixels - however, I wanted to solve the opposite problem of trying to reconstruct the two gaussians given the pixel-wise probability distribution. To do that, I first want to solve a simpler, 1D version of this problem. Here is an image showing the 1D problem: Visualization of the 1D problem In a 1D setting, the element-wise probability distribution simplifies to this calculation: $$P(x) = \int_{0}^{x} N_0(z) \hspace{0.1cm} dz \int_{x}^{W} N_1(z) \hspace{0.1cm} dz$$ In this example there are 16 discrete probability valuse at each of 16 positions of the 1D array. In my toy example I just made up two gaussians to calculate the resulting $P(x)$ . The ""observations"" are discretizations of that $P$ with some gaussian noise added. My approach to reverse engineer the two gaussians from the observations was to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between observations and the combined integrated distribution. This leads to my problem: After some reformulation of the KL-divergence I'm stuck at actually minimizing it, because the logarithm doesn't act directly on the gaussians but on the integrals. I don't know how to approach the problem from here, or if an analytical solution even exists at all. I'll write down the steps I have done so far. $W$ is the width of the 1D array and $O(x)$ the observation at position x: $$D_{KL} (O||P) = \sum_{x=1}^W O(x) ln \left(  \frac{O(x)}{\int_{0}^{x} N_0(z) \hspace{0.1cm} dz \int_{x}^{W} N_1(z) \hspace{0.1cm} dz} \right)$$ $$= \sum_{x=1}^W O(x) \left[ln (O(x) - ln \left( \int_{0}^{x} N_0(z) \hspace{0.1cm} dz \right) - ln \left( \int_{x}^{W} N_1(z) \hspace{0.1cm} dz \right)\right]$$ $$= \sum_{x=1}^W O(x) ln(O(x) - \sum_{x=1}^W O(x)\hspace{0.1cm} ln \left( \int_{0}^{x} N_0(z) \hspace{0.1cm} dz \right)- \sum_{x=1}^W O(x)\hspace{0.1cm} ln \left( \int_{x}^{W} N_1(z) \hspace{0.1cm} dz \right)$$ If I want to minimize this term, that brings me to the following subproblem (each of the optimization variables $\mu_1, \mu_2, \sigma_1, \sigma_2$ is only in one of the terms, so for each only one of the addends is relevant): $$max \hspace{0.1cm} \mu_1,\sigma_1 \sum_{z=0}^{x} O(x)\hspace{0.1cm} ln \left(\int_{0}^{x} \frac{1}{\sigma_1 \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_1)^2}{2\sigma_1^2}} dz \right) \rightarrow$$ $$\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu_1} \sum_{z=0}^{x} O(x)\hspace{0.1cm} ln \left(\int_{0}^{x} \frac{1}{\sigma_1 \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_1)^2}{2\sigma_1^2}} dz \right)$$ $$\frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma_1} \sum_{z=0}^{x} O(x)\hspace{0.1cm} ln \left(\int_{0}^{x} \frac{1}{\sigma_1 \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_1)^2}{2\sigma_1^2}} dz \right)$$ This is the point at which I don't really know what to do anymore. If anybody can point me at how to solve this or a completely different approach to get to the two original gaussians without iterative numeric approaches, I'd be really thankful!","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"

3794036,What's the right definitition of continuously differentiable?,"Suppose $V$ and $W$ are Banach spaces, $U\subset V$ is open, and $F:U\to W$ is a differentiable function. Then the derivative of $F$ is the map $$ DF:U\to B(V;W) $$ where $B(V;W)$ is the Banach space of continuous linear maps $V\to W$ . We say that $F$ is of class $\mathcal{C}^1$ at a point $x_0\in U$ if the mapping $$ U\ni x\mapsto DF(x) \in B(V;W) $$ is continuous at $x_0$ ; we say that $F$ is of class $\mathcal{C}^1$ on $U$ if $F$ is of class $\mathcal{C}^1$ at each point in $U$ . If $X$ is an arbitrary subset of the Banach space $V$ and $f:X\to W$ is a map, then we say that $f$ is of class $\mathcal{C}^1$ on $X$ if there exists an open subset $U$ of $V$ where $X\subset U$ and a function $F:U\to W$ of class $\mathcal{C}^1$ on $U$ where $F|_X=f$ . (Informally, we can extend $f$ to an open set on which it is of class $\mathcal{C}^1$ .) See this answer for a function $f$ which is continuously differentiable at only a single point. Namely, if $g(t)=t^2\sin(1/t)$ for $t\in\mathbb{R}$ then the function $$ f(t) = \sum_{n\geq 1} \frac{g(t-1/n)}{2^n} $$ is continuously differentiable at $t=0$ . However, $f$ has discontinuities arbitrarily close to the origin so $f$ cannot be of class $\mathcal{C}^1$ on any open set containing $0$ . That is, $f$ is a function which is of class $\mathcal{C}^1$ at $0$ , but $f$ is not $\mathcal{C}^1$ on $\{0\}$ . This does not seem right to me. Of course, it is not ""typical"" for a function we encounter to behave this way. However, this example still bothers me. What can we do? Can we slightly modify the above definitions so that this does not happen? Is the answer I referenced somehow incorrect?

3794228,"Is there a bijective function $f:[0,1] \to [0,1]$ such that the graph of $f$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a dense subset of $[0,1] \times [0,1]$?","Is there a bijective function $f:[0,1] \to [0,1]$ such that the graph of $f$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a dense subset of $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ ? (Exact same as title). I think the question is not affected much if we ask the same question but for a function $f:(0,1) \to [0,1]$ or $f:[0,1) \to (0,1]$ etc, as opposed to $f:[0,1] \to [0,1]$ , which was in the original question. All that really matters is that the domain and range are bounded, connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . I suspect the answer to the question is yes, but I don't know how to construct such a function. The first thing to note is that, if such a function exists it must be nowhere continuous, else the graph of f would not be dense throughout all of $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ . However, it is not clear if the graph of our function would be a totally disconnected subset of $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ . Can a nowhere continuous function have a connected graph? I have actually not read the answers to the above question in any detail, and anyway, it may not be relevant to answer the question here (although it might). My attempt: Let $f_{ Conway_{(0,1)} }:(0,1) \to \mathbb{R} $ be the Conway base-13 function , but with domain restricted to $(0,1)$ . Now define $f_{Conway_{(0,1)}bounded}(x) = \frac{1}{\pi} \arctan(f_{ Conway_{(0,1)} }(x)) + \frac{1}{2}$ with domain $(0,1)$ and range $(0,1)$ . Then the function is well-defined, and the graph of $f_{Conway_{(0,1)}bounded}:(0,1) \to (0,1)$ is a dense subset of $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ . Now we can easily modify our function $f_{Conway_{(0,1)}bounded}$ so that it has domain $[0,1]$ and range $[0,1]$ , and I will assume the reader can do this and leave the details for brevity. But the point is, these missing two points in the domain, $0$ and $1$ , are not a problem. The problem is that our function is not injective. Note that we cannot answer the question by only removing points from the graph of $f_{Conway_{(0,1)}bounded}$ , for then you would be removing lots of points from the domain, and so this would not be a function with domain $(0,1)$ . So maybe doing something clever to $f_{Conway_{(0,1)}bounded}$ , or perhaps coming up with an entirely different way to construct a function to answer the question is necessary.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

3794380,Show that an increasing function has derivative $0$ a.e.,"Let $0<p<1$ and define $F:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1]$ by $$F(x)=\begin{cases}
pF(2x),&x\in\left[0,\frac12\right]\\
p+qF(2x-1),&x\in\left[\frac12,1\right]
\end{cases}$$ where $q=1-p$ .  I would like to prove that $F'(x)=0$ a.e. I am working my way through ""How to Gamble If You Must"" by Kyle Siegerst, which is basically a series of exercises. $F(x)$ is the probability that a gambler starting with a bankroll $0\leq x\leq 1$ will reach his target of $1$ if he engages in ""bold play"" in the game of red and black.  When his bankroll is $\leq\frac12$ he bets it all, winning the amount bet with probability $p$ , and losing it with probability $q$ .  When his bankroll is $>\frac12$ , he bets just enough to reach the target, that is, $1-x$ . In the exercises, I have shown that there is a unique function $F$ satisfying the functional equation above, and that it is continuous and strictly increasing.  Following exercise $33$ , the author remarks that when $p\neq\frac12$ , $F'(X)=0$ a.e., so that $F$ is a devil's staircase.  I have been trying to prove this statement.  (I know that an increasing function is differentiable a.e.  It's the value that I'm having trouble with.) Vague $50$ -year-old memories of measure theory have led me to Proposition 3.31 in Folland's ""Real Analysis"", to wit If $F\in NBV, \text{ then }F\in L^1(m).$ Moreover, $\mu_F\perp m \text{ iff } F' =0$ a.e., and $\mu_F \ll m \text{ iff } F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xF'(t)dt. $ Here $m$ is Lebesgue measure, and a.e. is with respect to Lebesgue measure. $\mu_F$ is the Borel measure defined by $\mu_F([a,b])=F(b)-F(a)$ .  Folland uses $NBV$ to mean that $F$ is of bounded variation, $F(-\infty)=0$ and $F$ is right continuous.  This is no problem, as we can extend $F$ to $\mathbb{R}$ by defining $F(x)=0$ for $x<0$ and $F(x)=1$ for $x>1$ . So it seems to come down to showing $\mu_F\perp m$ .  This means that there is an $E\subset[0,1]$ with $m(E)=0$ and $\mu_F(E)=1$ if I'm not mistaken.  I don't see how to prove this.  Indeed it doesn't seem at all likely to me, so I must misunderstand something. In exercise 29, I proved that $$F(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty p_{x_1}\cdots p_{x_{n-1}}px_n$$ where $x_i$ is bit number $i$ of $x$ , and $p_0=p,\ p_1=q$ .  (When $x$ is a dyadic rational, we take the terminating representation.)   If we represent wins by $1$ and losses by $0$ , this means that the gambler reaches the goal if and only if the first time a bit in his bankroll matches the corresponding game bit, those bits are both $1$ .  This is the most concrete representation of $F$ in the paper, but I don't see how it helps. Can you cast any light on this for me?","['measure-theory', 'probability', 'radon-nikodym']"
3794418,Difficulty in understanding significance of Grelling's Paradox.,"Background: I'm a math rookie, yet to enrol in university. I randomly started reading Mendelson's Introduction to Mathematical Logic , when I stumbled upon this paradox in the introductory section: Grelling's Paradox: An adjective is called autological if the property denoted by the adjective holds for the adjective itself. An adjective is called heterological if the property denoted by the adjective does not apply to the adjective itself. For example, 'polysyllabic' and 'English' are autological, whereas 'monosyllabic' and 'French' are heterological. Consider the adjective 'heterological'. If 'heterological' is heterological, then it is not heterological. If 'heterological' is not heterological, then it is heterological. In either case, heterological is both heterological and not heterological. I'd like to understand the following: What is the source of logical fallacy in this paradox? If I formulate a set $A$ of all adjectives and subsets $A_a$ and $A_h$ corresponding to autological and heterological adjectives, respectively, then it could be the case that $\text{(heterological)}\in A-(A_a\cup A_h)$ , i.e., it belongs to neither of the two sets(unless $A_a\cap A_h=\emptyset$ and $A_a\cup A_h=A$ ). On a lighter note, I'd like to know about the mathematical significance of this paradox, and how it's dealt with in modern set theories.

3794458,Proof of the spectral decomposition theorem for normal operators on a finite-dimensional vector space,"So, I was reading the book Nielsen and Chuang and it's introductory chapter on Quantum Mechanics and it had a theorem called the ""Spectral Decomposition Theorem"" which states that an Operator $M$ is a normal operator if and only if it can be diagonalized in the orthonormal basis (which turn out to be the eigen-vectors). Now, I have some trouble understanding the forward proof, which was to prove that if I have a Normal operator, it can be diagonalized. I am attaching the proof that is written in the book. Ultimately, it uses Projectors onto eigenspaces of a particular eigen value $P_\lambda=\sum_i |\lambda ; i\rangle \langle\lambda;i |$ and it's Orthogonal complement $Q_\lambda \equiv I-P_\lambda$ and rewrite $M=(P_\lambda+Q_\lambda)M(P_\lambda+Q_\lambda)$ which then simplifies to $M=P_\lambda MP_\lambda +Q_\lambda M Q_\lambda$ and using principle of mathematical induction, one can indeed prove that M can be diagonalized with respect to some orthonormal basis. The part of the proof that I don't understand is that somehow, it implies that the operator $M$ can be diagonalized with respect to eigenvectors of this Normal Operator and that they are necessarily orthogonal. Also, if I try to write down $M$ in outer-product representation, it somehow simplifies as $M=\sum_i \lambda_i |e_i\rangle\langle e_i|$ where $\lambda_i$ 's are the eigen-values and $|e_i\rangle$ 's are the eigenvectors.

3794651,Commuting of derivation on localization and canonical map,"This problem is from van der Put's ""Galois Theory of Linear Differential Equations"". Show that there exists a unique derivation $\partial$ on $RS^{-1}$ (the localization of $R$ with respect to $S$ ) such that the canonical map for $R \rightarrow RS^{-1}$ commutes with $\partial$ where $R$ is a commutative ring and $S \subset R$ is a multiplicative subset. Here is my attempt with my rough understanding of the concepts in this problem. Let $\phi : R \rightarrow RS^{-1}$ be the canonical map. We want to show that $\partial (\phi (x)) = \phi (\partial (x))$ for $x \in R$ . Observe that by definition, $\phi (\partial (x))$ maps $x \mapsto [\partial (x)],$ the equivalence class of $\partial (x)$ in $RS^{-1}$ (this IS how the canonical map works, right?). On the other hand, $\partial (\phi (x))$ maps $x \mapsto \partial ([x]) = [\partial (x)],$ which is the same equivalence class in $RS^{-1}$ as mapped to by $\phi (\partial (x)).$ Thus, we conclude that $\phi$ and $\partial$ commute. But I'm not sure how to show that there is a unique $\partial$ that satisfies this problem. Could someone please help?

Show that $F+ \Bbb{R}v$ is closed. If $E=F+ \Bbb{R}v$ , show that $E$ is the direct sum of $F$ and $\Bbb Rv$ (meaning the map $\phi(f,rv)= f+rv$ is a toplinear isomorphism from $F\times \Bbb Rv$ to $E$ , i.e. a homeomorphism and isomorphism). I can prove $F+ \Bbb{R}v$ is closed by looking at the quotient space $E/F$ . As the image of $F+ \Bbb{R}v$ under the quotient map $\rho$ is homeomorphic to $\Bbb R$ , it is automatically closed in $E/F$ , whose inverse image is closed in $E$ by continuity of $\rho$ . But $\rho^{-1}(\rho(F+ \Bbb{R}v))=F+ \Bbb{R}v$ , thereby proving the closeness of $F+ \Bbb{R}v$ . But I am stuck at showing the latter statement. It suffices to show that $\phi$ is an open map, which amounts to showing $U_1+U_2$ is open if $U_1$ and $U_2$ are open subsets of $F$ and $\Bbb Rv$ , respectively. Lang mentions that this is an easy consequence of the open mapping theorem, which is a more general result. However, doesn't that assume completeness of $E$ ? I try to use the quotient space technique, but that doesn't seem to apply here as $U_1+U_2$ needs not be saturated. How should I proceed?

If the limit is finite, say $L$ , then for every $\varepsilon >0$ there exists an $M(\varepsilon)$ such that for $$x>M(\varepsilon) \colon \quad |f(x)-L|\leq \varepsilon$$ Assume $f (x) \ne c$ . By definition of convexity, it has to hold (for $t \in [0,1]$ ) $$t f(M)+(1-t)f(M+1) \leq f(t M + (1-t)(M+1))$$ Now, by definition of limit, $f(M)$ and $f(M+1)$ are less than $L-\varepsilon$ . Also, the argument in the rhs of the inequality can be simplified: $$L-\varepsilon <t f(M)+(1-t)f(M+1) \leq f(t M + (1-t)(M+1)) = f(M-t)$$ Therefore $$L-\varepsilon < f(M-t)$$ , which is a contradiction because $M-t<M$ and hence it can be greater than $L-\varepsilon$ .

By IVT, $ x^{-1} : (c,1) \to [0, +\infty)$ . Applying the inverse function theorem a second time we see that the unique solution on $[0,  \epsilon]$ can be extended to a unique solution on $[0, \infty)$ . Taking should now be justified.

So the density function of the sample is given by a multivariate hypergeometric distribution: $$f(x_1,\ldots, x_n) = \frac{\binom{M}{x_1}\cdots\binom{M}{x_n}}{\binom{Mn}{Mn/6}}.$$ Can one say anything about the limiting behavior of the distribution as $M\to\infty$ , where the number of colors $n$ is fixed? Since the sample size grows at the same rate as the population size, this wouldn't converge to a binomial/multinomial distribution as it would if the sample size were fixed. Any help is appreciated! (The $1/6$ in $Mn/6$ is arbitrary, I'm just curious in general about the case where the sample size is always a fixed fraction of the population size). I guess it wouldn't surprise me if nothing really useful can be said, in which case I have a related question. Suppose you consider the same scenario, but instead of starting off with $M$ balls of each color, we only started off with, say, $5M/6$ balls of each color. So the modified density function would be: $$g(x_1,\ldots, x_n) = \frac{\binom{5M/6}{x_1}\cdots\binom{5M/6}{x_n}}{\binom{5Mn/6}{Mn/6}}.$$ As $M\to\infty$ , is there any meaningful relationship between $f$ and $g$ that can be made?

3795454,Using the Snowflake Method to Factor Trinomials,"In school, students may be taught different ways to factor the trinomial $$ax^2+bx+c$$ where $a \neq 1,0$ . Possible methods include the classic Guess and Check Method, Grouping, Box Method , and the Snowflake Method , which is the one I'm focused on right now. If the Snowflake Method is used correctly, factoring trinomials can happen much quicker than using the traditional Guess and Check Method. Indeed, the Snowflake Method works for factoring the following trinomial: $$5x^2-x-18$$ First we set up the snowflake: To briefly summarize, we label and fill in the ""wings"" as seen above. Then we find the factors of $c$ that add to $b$ and multiply to $ac$ and put them in the empty wings. This creates fractions which I circled, and they must be reduced if possible. This gives us the correct factored form of $\boxed{(x-2)(5x+9)}$ . Now, here is my problem. I tried to use the Snowflake Method to factor $$7x^2+37x+36$$ I set up the snowflake as follows: There was no ""nice"" factor pair here because no pair multiplied to get $ac=252$ . However, I noticed that $(7)(36)=252$ , so I chose the pair $(36,1)$ . This would imply that the factored form is $$(7x+36)(7x+1)$$ but clearly this is incorrect. The answer should be $$(7x+9)(x+4)$$ I don't see how the Snowflake Method can produce this. It seems to impossible to produce the $(x+4)$ term because if we divide $7$ by any of the factors of $36$ , we will not get $4$ . I would like to understand: Why did the Snowflake Method not work for this example? Is there some restriction when using the Snowflake Method that I missed?","['algebra-precalculus', 'factoring', 'polynomials']"

Let $U$ be the set of all permutations without any conditions. Then $$|U|=\frac{(3+3+3)!}{3!3!3!}=1680.$$ We have $$|\Delta_3|=\frac{(1+3+3)!}{1!3!3!}=140$$ (as $\Delta_3$ is the set of permutations of $DDD,O,O,O,G,G,G$ ), and $$|\Delta_2|+2|\Delta_3|=\frac{(1+1+3+3)!}{1!1!3!3!}=1120$$ since this number counts the permutations of $DD,D,O,O,O,G,G,G$ .

3795526,Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Space curves using Rigid Transformation by Peter Baxandall ( Vector Calculus ),"I am reading Vector calculus by Peter Baxandall which proves the Fundamental theorem of Space curves ( Curves with equal torsion and curvature are identical except probably their position) in the following manner: In the proof, the author says : Pick any $p \in E$ . Hold $C_g$ fixed and move $C_h$ rigidly in $\Bbb R^3$ until $T_h(p) = T_g(p) , \cdots$ . I do not see very clearly the motive and mechanism by which the author is able to do so. I understand rigid transformation as something which preserves the length of the curve. However, we may even have to employ rotation to make the unit tangent vector $T_g$ and $T_h$ the same. But, in the last line, he ultimately says that $C_h$ is a translation of $C_g$ . Also, I couldn't find where has the author used the fact that the torsion and curvatures of the two curves are equal . $$\phi = T_g \cdot T_h + N_g \cdot N_h + B_g \cdot B_h \\ \implies \phi' = T_g' \cdot T_h + T_g \cdot T_h' + N_g' \cdot N_h + N_g \cdot N_h' +  B_g' \cdot B_h + B_g \cdot B_h'$$ . But since, we have already have : $T_g=T_h,N_g=N_h,B_g=B_h$ , thus : $T_g⋅T_h'=0=T_g'⋅T_h$ . Similarily, for others, each dot product turns out to be $0$ . We haven't seemed to use the fact that the torsions and curvatures of the two curves are equal ? Could someone please explain what's actually going on. Thanks a lot!

3795551,"Prove that any injective function from $\{ 1, \dots, n \}$ to itself is bijective.","This is Exercise 1 from page 50 of Analysis I by Amann and Escher. I have found similar questions here and here but neither of those questions has a solution that uses what's hinted at in the text. Exercise: My attempt: It seems simple to argue that, since an injective function sends each element in its domain to a different element in the codomain, it has to ""hit"" all the elements in $\{ 1, \dots, n \}$ . I am not sure if this is formal enough, and at any rate it doesn't use the hint given. If I use the hint, then the base case of an injective function $\{ 1 \} \to \{ 1 \}$ is definitely bijective. Assume that any injective function from $\{ 1, \dots, n \}$ to $\{ 1, \dots, n \}$ is bijective, and consider the injective function $f \colon \{ 1 , \dots, n + 1 \} \to \{ 1 , \dots, n + 1 \}$ as described. We want to show that $f$ is bijective. It seems to me that there are at least two basic ways to show that $f$ is bijective. First, we can show that it's surjective, which involves considering some element $l \in \{ 1 , \dots, n + 1 \}$ and showing there exists an element $m$ in the same set such that $f(m) = l$ . The second way is to show that there exists a function $i$ such that $f \circ i$ is the identity function. However, an inductive proof should really use the inductive assumption, and I'm not sure either of these tactics do. I find the hint given pretty mystifying, but I have collected a few thoughts regarding the hint below. I see that $g$ is bijective. It is almost the identity function except that it sends $k$ to $n + 1$ and $n + 1$ to $k$ . Since $f$ and $g$ are injective, $h$ is also injective. I also see that $g$ undoes what $f$ does to $n + 1$ , hence $h(n + 1) = n + 1$ . The function $h$ is almost the same as $f$ , except for the swapping done by $g$ as described in 1. The restriction $h \mid \{ 1, \dots, n\}$ does not send any element to $n + 1$ , because the only element that $h$ sends to $n + 1$ is $n + 1$ , and $n + 1$ is outside the restriction.
