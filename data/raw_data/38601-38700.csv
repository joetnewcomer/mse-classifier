377310,Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$ is not a probability measure,"So I'm not a math student hence the (probably rather simple) question in the title. I could not find an answer in the slides or the internet. My intuition is that the elements (ie. reals) of  $\mathbb{R}$ are not countable, hence no probability measure can be established.

377333,Sum of stationary process,"Suppose you have two stationary process $A_{t}$ and $B_{t}$. Suppose $Z_{t} = A_{t} + B_{t}$. Show that $Z_{t}$ is stationary. I am unsure how to solve this without knowing if the processes are independent from each other. $\gamma_{z}(h) = E[Z_{t}Z_{t+h}] = A_{t}A_{t+h} + A_{t}B_{t+h} + B_{t}A_{t+h} + B_{t}B_{t+h} = \gamma_{A}(h) + \gamma_{BA}(h) + \gamma_{AB}(h) + \gamma_{B}(h)$. Now if the series are independent, then the cross-covariance functions are 0 and $\gamma_{z}(h) = \gamma_{A}(h) + \gamma_{B}(h)$. So my question is, do we require that $A_{t}$ and $B_{t}$ are independent from each other in order for $Z_{t}$ to be stationary?","['stochastic-processes', 'probability']"

And let $x_i$ be the number of balls chosen of type $i$ (excluding the $k$ previously chosen) and these $x_i$'s should satisfy: $$ x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_{n-k} = m .\tag{1}$$ and clearly $$ 1 \leq x_i \leq 2 \tag{2}$$ Taking the generating function to solve this partition problem . $$ (x+x^2)^{n-k} \tag{3}$$ the $x^m$ term in $(3)$ is say $X_m$ and the answer becomes $n\choose k$$X_m$.

377496,Why matrix representation of convolution cannot explain the convolution theorem?,"A record saying that Convolution Theorem is trivial since it is identical to the statement that convolution, as Toeplitz operator, has fourier eigenbasis and, therefore, is diagonal in it, has disappeared from Wikipedia. The Convolution Theorem states that convolution of functions, h(t) and x(t), in time domain is equivalent to their multiplication in the frequency domain. That is, you convolve them, h*x, and take result into frequency domain. Result F(h*x) must be the same as multiplying their Fourier images, H and X: $F(h*x) = H \cdot X$, where H and X are fourier images, $H = F(h)$ and $X = F(x)$. This was the definition where I used the letters h and x for the functions, instead of conventional f and g, because convolution h*x is often represented by h(x), where h is a convolution matrix derived from the first function, h, which is applied to the second function, x. Being Toeplitz, matrix h has eigenbasis F -- the same as apply to vector to take it into Fourier domain (see change of basis to see why base matrix product for base transform). Therefore, matrix h, translated into its eigenbasis, happens to be diagonal and H. That is, according to the Convolution Theorem, we must prove that $$F(h \vec x) = H \vec X$$ But, there is nothing to prove. We just can show that $$H \vec X = (FhF^{-1})(F\vec x) = F(F^{-1}F)h(F^{-1}F)\vec x = F(h \vec x)$$ or, the other way around $$F(h \vec x) = F(F^{-1}F)h(F^{-1}F)\vec x = (FhF^{-1})(F\vec x) = H \vec X$$ just to exercise the beautiful algebra of relationships and diagonalization in F. We just need to keep in mind that $H = FhF^{-1}$ is diagonal ( multiplication operator ) because F is eigenbasis of h. This discussion was classified as nonsense. But why? I find it amazing that Toeplitz (or convolution) has Fourier eigenbasis. Should this precious fact be hidden from the general population? Why should general population appreciate the integral-based proof rather than enjoy this fact? Can I say that Toeplitz operator = Convolution (operator)? Can I say that operator is a (continuous-case) generalization of matrix? Is convolution theorem related with the Fourier eigenbasis? Can it be explained simpler, based on this fact?","['convolution', 'operator-theory', 'proof-without-words', 'matrices', 'alternative-proof']"

377557,What is the proof that anti-derivative gives function = area under curve?,"For many years now I have thought about this but have not been able to get a clear answer.

This part of $\displaystyle \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ has been explained to me many times since high school and is crystal clear. By using this I obtain that derivative of $\sin$ is $\cos$ and derivative of $x^n$ is $nx^{n-1}$.

377580,A (partial) argument converting sums in $\ell^1$ into Lebesgue-integrable functions.,"First, I want to mention that this problem is off of a take home final I have. I was given permission to research/ask about this specific line of reasoning, in large because I think the professor thinks it might work and this is not a ``standard'' solution to this problem. The question on the exam is: Given  a measurable space $(X,B)$, and $\mu_n$ a sequence of measures on $(X,B)$ with $\mu_n(A) \rightarrow \mu(A)$ for each $A \in B$. If $\mu(X) < \infty$, then $\mu$ is a measure. A little notation: Let $\{a^{(n)}\}$ be a collection of sequences, where the $i$th term in the $j$th sequence is given by $a^{(j)}_i$. The above theorem can be deduced readily from the following lemma: Let $\{a^{(n)}\}$ be a collection of sequences of non-negative real numbers. Suppose $\exists M >0$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^\infty a^{(n)}_i < M$ for each $n$. Suppose further that $a^{(n)}_i \rightarrow a_i$, some real number as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Then $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^\infty a^{(n)}_i =\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i$$ Now, my attempt at proving the lemma was to turn this into a problem in measure theory. Given $\{a^{(n)}\}$ as in the lemma, define $$\phi_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty a^{(n)}_i \chi_{(i,i+1]}$$.
Where $\chi_A$ is the usuall characteristic function for a set $A$.  Intuitively, $\phi_n(x)$ looks like an infinite step function, where $\phi_n(x) = a^{(n)}_i$ if $x \in (i,i+1]$. Now, it is clear that $\int \phi_n(x) dx = \sum_{i=1}^\infty a^{(n)}_i$. Moreover, we have that $\phi_n(x) \rightarrow \phi(x) := \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i \chi_{(i,i+1]}$. All that remains is to show:
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int \phi_n(x) = \int \phi(x)$$ This will require some kind of convergence theorem. There doesn't seem to be one readily available, but these functions have lots of special properties. Such a convergence theorem would start with ``Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of non-negative Lebesgue integrable functions. '' Here are some hypotheses one could take: $f_n \rightarrow f$ pointwise. $\int f_n  < M$ for some universal bound $M$. As a sequence in $n$, $\int f_n$ converges and is finite. $\|f_n\|_\infty < M$ for some universal constant $M$. Unfortunately, I don't believe these hypotheses quite do it. Say $\phi_n = \chi_{(n,n+1]}$. These guys converge pointwise to $0$ but in integral to $1$. My question is: Is there a set of additional hypotheses one can take to deduce a convergence theorem that resolves the lemma? EDIT: Okay, it has been pointed out that the lemma isn't true (with a clear counterexample). The question now becomes can one take the theorem, and build the correct lemma that allows you to employ this kind of technique? I've basically managed to do nothing but persuade myself that $\mu(X)< \infty$ must tell you more than  one can assume there is some $M$ such that for any countable collection of disjoint sets in $B$ $\sum \mu_n(A_i) < M$","['measure-theory', 'convergence-divergence']"
377614,2-dimensional percolation and a random graph,"Imagine turning the square grid defined by $\mathbb{N}^2$ in the plane into a directed graph. The vertices are $\mathbb{N}^2$ and for each vertex $(x,y)$, there is an edge pointing from it to $(x+1, y)$ and another pointing to $(x,y+1)$. Turn it into a random graph, by letting the edges appear independently at random with probability $p$. Let $p_n$ be the probability that there is a directed path from (0,0) to the set of points of taxi-cab distance $n$ to the origin. Then we see that $p_n$ is a decreasing sequence, whose limit is the probability that there is an infinite directed path. Take $n$. I want to know how close $p_n$ is to the limit. Let $r_n=p_{n+1}/p_n$. If I know tha t $r_n, r_{n+1}, \dots$ are ""large"", then somehow, I know I am ""close"" to the limit. I am trying to come up with a lower bound for $r_n$. The easiest thing, is to argue that, this equals the probability that there is a path reaching points at taxi-cab distance $n+1$ given that there is a path reaching those at distance $n$. This conditional probability is at least $(1-(1-p)^2)$, which is the probability that at one vertex there are edges pointing out from it.

What is the ultimate confusion is the statement: $\text{we will use the notation} P(X) \text{ to denote the distribution of the random variable X}$ Again, what exactly is meant by the probability distribution $P$ here?

This is very straight forward to show (this is a separable ODE).  But I'm not too sure about the method of averaging. There is a section in Arnold's Mechanics on this..... which I don't understand.  Any ideas greatly appreciated. A partial result is that the solution should look like the following: $$x(t) \approx x(0)(1-\epsilon t)$$
This can be obtained by Taylor expanding the exact solution of the exponential, throwing out terms squared or higher, and approximating $\sin(t)$ by t.

(a) Prove that any simple module is isomorphic to R/M, where M is a maximal ideal. My questions are: Is $R/M$ a left module over $R$? or over itself $R/M$? When we defined a module $N$ we defined a map $R\times N\to N$ where $R$ is a ring and $N$ is an Abelian group. Now let the ring $R$ be $M$ as given in question, where $M$ is a maximal ideal of $R$. So the map becomes 
$M\times N\to N$. As far as I know, there no equivalent notion of ideal in module. The reason I said that is because from the definition of quotient module $V/W$, $W$ is just a submodule of $V$, not an ""ideal"" submodule of $V$. Is my reasoning correct? If my reasoning in 2. above is wrong, then how can we interpret a maximal ideal in a language of module? Is there a definition of maximal ideal in module distinct to definition of a maximal ideal in ring? To prove the question, I consulted other sources in the internet. There is a proof that says ""Any submodule of $R/M$ is an ideal, since it would be an additive group that is closed under multiplication by elements of $R$ and therefore $R/M$.""

377764,"Given some data, how can I tell how well it fits a (continuous) uniform distribution?","I have a set of $30$ real numbers between zero and one.  Let's say that the null hypothesis is that this data set fits a uniform distribution and that the alternative hypothesis is that this data set does not fit a uniform distribution.  How would I test this? My only ideas so far would be to divide the continuous distribution into a set of several categories so that the expected count in each category is at least five.  With a set of $30$ numbers, I would divide the interval $(0,1)$ into six equal sections, such as $(0,0.166)$, $(0.166,0.333)$, etc.  For each interval, I would count the quantity of data points that fall within the interval. Now that I have converted the original data into categorical data, I can run a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test with (in this case) $5$ degrees of freedom. The above paragraph is just speculation on my part.  Is there a better way to determine how well data fits a uniform distribution?",['statistics']

377782,Application of Liouville's Theorem,"Let $f(z)$ be an entire function such that $$|f(z)|<\frac{1}{|\text{Im}(z)|},\qquad z\in\Bbb C-\Bbb R.$$ The question asked me to prove that $f(z)=0$. At least looking at it, it really seems to have an application of Liouville's theorem lurking around somewhere, but I haven't found it. My thoughts first led me to think about doing this by contradiction and using Picard's little theorem. So, I've considered a strip containing the real axis (say of width $2$ for simplicity). This will imply the complement maps into the unit disk, which implies that this strip has to map almost everywhere else on the complex plane. Now, on the imaginary axis, I know that $f(z)$ will vanish as $z\to\infty$, and this seems like it might be useful. I'm sort of under the impression $f(z)$ might have an essential singularity at $\infty$, which would mean $f(1/z)$ has an essential singularity at $0$. Either way, it of course can't have a pole at $\infty$ because of $f(z)$ vanishing on the imaginary axis, and if it is a removable singularity, it must be $0$, which still gives the solution. Therefore, I think it must have something to do with $f(z)$ having an essential singularity at $\infty$. I was hoping to combine this with the above inequality and deduce a contradiction, but I haven't thought of one yet. Any hints or suggestions? I'm studying for a prelim. exam, so this isn't homework. Update: So, in the spirit of searching methods using the essential singularity at $z=0$, we have $$\left|f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)\right|\leq\frac{1}{\left|\text{Im}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)\right|}=\frac{|z|^2}{|y|}.$$ Thus, for $|y|>1$, we have $$\left|f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)\right|<|y|\left|f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)\right|<|z|^2.$$ Thus, if I can show that $|f(1/z)|$ is a polynomial, we'll know it can't have an essential singularity at the origin, concluding my proof.",['complex-analysis']
377793,Submanifold with boundary of a manifold with boundary,"Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. (1) A subset $S$ of $M$ that with the subspace topology is a topological manifold (with or without boundary), together with a differential structure that makes the inclusion $\iota:S\rightarrow M$ a smooth embedding (that is, a smooth map with constant rank equal to the dimension of $S$), is called a smooth submanifold with or without boundary. (2) Equivallently, you could ask for $S$ to satisfy the following condition: There's a fixed $k$, such that, for every $p$ in $S$, there's a smooth chart $(U,\varphi)$ of $M$, such that $\varphi(U\cap S)$ is a k-slice of $\varphi(U)$, where  a k-slice fo a set $U$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ will be $\lbrace x\in U:x_k \geq 0$ and $x_{k+1}=\cdots=x_n=0\rbrace$. Now, if we now let $M$ have a boundary, I think these two definitions aren' t equivalent anymore. I see how the second definition still implies the first one, but I have problems with the other impliciation. So, does the first one imply the second one? That is, Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and $S\subseteq M$ as in (1). Does $S$ satisfy the condition stated in (2)? The difficulty is that when proving this for $M$ without a boundary, you use the constant rank theorem, which (I understand), may no hold when the codomain has non-empty boundary.","['manifolds-with-boundary', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

377918,Isomorphism between $E_8$ lattice and lattice defined by Extended Hamming Code,"I have read that the following two lattices are isomorphic, and of course it seems believable, but it would be nice to have a sketch of how to construct the bijection.

For example, let it be generated by: $$G = \left(\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ {\bf 1} & {\bf 1} & {\bf 1} & {\bf 0}\end{array}\right)$$ Let $L$ be the lattice defined as containing all points in $\mathbb{Z}^8$ such that reduction modulo $2$ component-by-component ($\phi$) gives you a codeword, or in other words, $L = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}^8: \phi(x) \in C\}$. It is well-known and pretty easy to show that the minimum norm is $2$. These minimum norm vectors of norm $2$ corresponding to weight $0$ codewords have a $\pm 2$ in one of the $8$ entries, so there are $2 \times 8 = 16$ of these. The vectors of norm $2$ corresponding to weight $4$ codewords have a $\pm 1$ in four digits. There are $14$ weight $4$ codewords, so there are $14 \times 2^4$ of these. Then there are $2^4 + 14 \times 2^4 = 15 \times 16 = 240$ vectors of minimum norm $2$. Let $E$ by the $E_8$ lattice with the even construction so that the parity is even and all points are either all integral or all half-integral. By a similar argument, there are also $240$ vectors of minimum norm $\sqrt{2}$. But these look different. For example, any vectors with a $1$ in two of the eight positions has minimum norm $2$, and each of these you can permute the signs to give ${{8}\choose{2}} \times 4$ of them. Any half-integer vector of minimum norm $2$ must have all $\frac{1}{2}$ with an even number of positive (or negative) entries, so there are ${{8}\choose{2}} \times 4 + \left({{8}\choose{8}} + {{8}\choose{6}} + {{8}\choose{4}} + {{8}\choose{2}} + {{8}\choose{0}}\right) = 112 + 2^7 = 240$ total minimum norm $\sqrt{2}$. My problem is that the vectors of minimum norm in $L$ and $E$ are totally different, even after rescaling. In $L$, there are vectors with $1$ and $4$ nonzero entries, while in $E$ there are vectors with $2$ and $8$ nonzero entries. Plus, the way that the minimum norm vectors are counted doesn't give a lot of insight.

377931,Asymptotic related to the infinite product of sine,"The amount is somewhat complicated ($x$ is a constant): $$S_n=\sum_{k=1}^n\ln\left(1-\frac{\sin^2\big(x/(2n+1)\big)}{\sin^2\big(k\pi/(2n+1)\big)}\right)\tag{*}$$ I want to enrich my handy powerful tools to discover the asymptotic behavior of such a summation directly as sharp as possible. Such an amount could be reduced in such a way: Since $(\cos x+i\sin x)^n=\cos nx+i\sin nx$, it's not hard to show that $$\sin(2n+1)\theta=\sin\theta\cdot P_n(\sin^2\theta)$$ where $P_n$ is a polynomial depend on $n$. From the zeros of $P_n(x)$, we could easily obtain that $$P_n(x)=(2n+1)\prod_{k=1}^n\left(1-\frac x{\sin^2\big(k\pi/(2n+1)\big)}\right)$$ Therefore $$S_n=\ln\sin x-\ln(2n+1)\sin\frac x{2n+1}\tag{1}$$ However, I want to obtain some techniques to estimate the summation directly. The methods and the disciplines are much more important than the result. As a result, one can compare with identity (1) to obtain some useful results. That's common in Eulerian mathematics. If $k$ is small enough, i.e $k=o(n)$, the summand $$a_{k}(n)=\ln\left(1-\frac{\sin^2\big(x/(2n+1)\big)}{\sin^2\big(k\pi/(2n+1)\big)}\right)$$ is approximately $$\ln\left(1-\frac{x^2}{k^2\pi^2}\right)$$ From some mechanical computation (Taylor expansion, etc), we could obtain a stronger result (if there's no calculation mistakes): $$a_k(n)=\ln\left(1-\frac{x^2}{k^2\pi^2}\right)+\frac{x^2}{3(2n+1)^2}+O(k^2n^{-4})$$ We could split the sumation $S_n=\sum_{k=1}^n=\sum_{0<k<n^{1-\epsilon}}+\sum_{n^{1-\epsilon}\le k\le n}$, where $\epsilon>0$ is a small constant, then the major distribution $\sum_{0<k<n^{1-\epsilon}}a_k(n)$ could be easily controlled, estimated as good as we want; however, the tail $\sum_{k\ge n^{1-\epsilon}}a_k(n)$ is a bit messy. It's not very small. I can only show that $\sum_{k\ge n^{1-\epsilon}}a_k(n)=O(n^{-1+2\epsilon})$, therefore the best result I could get is: $$S_n=\sum_{k=1}^\infty\ln\left(1-\frac{x^2}{k^2\pi^2}\right)+O(n^{-1+2\epsilon})$$ which is strong enough to prove the infinite product of $\sin$ function. However, I want to look into the $O$ notation to obtain sharper and sharper results. Can we do that directly through the definition (*)? Thanks! EDIT: $x$ might be a real constant (for my ignorance), but one could assume that it's a complex constant. The question of the real version is just the special case of the complex version, and there's no doubt that I'm pleased if one can deal with the complex version well. Remark: The case is somewhat like the case when Euler-Maclaurin formula is applicable. In that case, there's no tail after all! Here, the tail is small, but it's not small enough, say, exponentially small. I guess the key is to use an integral to estimate the error.","['asymptotics', 'sequences-and-series']"

The entry in OEIS does not mention exactly which elements should be compared (and when), though. I guess this is mentioned in the article it refers to, but I am not certain, since I don't have the moment and they don't seem to be available for free. But let's suppose we do know which elements should be compared. Then we can write up a list of pairs of these elements. Then, we could visualize these pairs by drawing a graph, in which each node represents an element of the list (that ought to be compared with another element in order to sort the list) and each vertex between two elements represents a comparison between two elements of the list that must be compared in order to sort the list.

So this means we need to show that the complex plane without the origin is isomorph to a cylinder of radius 1 'just above' the complex plane. Now if we can find a bijection $f:\mathbb{C}^* \to\mathbf{T}\times \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ where $f(x\cdot y) = f(x)\cdot f(y)$ we are done. I was thinking of using the function $$f:(a+bi) \mapsto (e^{i\tan^{-1}(\frac{b}{a})},a^2+b^2)$$ which simply means that we map every point in $\mathbb{C}^*$ to a point in the cylinder with angle equal to the angle of the original point and height equal to the magnitude of the original point. I got this idea from thinking about cylindrical coordinates $(r,\theta , z)$ where $r=1$. This is certainly a bijection because there exist an inverse transformation $f^{-1}: (u,r) \mapsto \left(r \left(\cos(\frac{\log(u)}{i}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\log(u)}{i}\right)\right)$ leading back to the original point in $\mathbb{C}^*$.

Does the above group arise naturally as a kernel of some map? 3) Is there a more natural notion of the above group in terms of ideles? 4) A general question on Dirichlet's unit theorem for $S$-units: Is there a version without any constraints on $S$, i.e. without having to assume that the archimedian places are in $S$, i.e. $S_\infty \subset S$?

For 1): My guess (above) is not right, but: Is $R_{K,S} = E_{K,S,1} \otimes \Bbb Z_p$, where $E_{K,S,1}$ denote the subgroup of $E_K$ that are principal units at every place $\nu \in S$? For 2): I know now that tensoring over $\Bbb Z_p$ kills the prime-to-$p$-part and every module becomes a $\Bbb Z_p$-module, one can therefore speak of the $\Bbb Z_p$-rank of every module. For 4): I now know that there can't be any version without the infinite places, because they are essential to the proof.

Now I would like to rotate the circle $C_1$ such that the sum of squares of the Euclidean-distances $\sum_i^nd(p_i,q_i)^2$ is minimized, where $d(.)$ indicates the Euclidean-distance. Note that both $p_i$ and $q_i$ are 2-d coordinates in real space. What is the angle of optimal rotation, in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction that minimizes these sums of Euclidean distances? I was looking at it as $P$ being hit by a rotation matrix and was finding the gradient w.r.t $\theta$ in the rotation matrix.","['optimization', 'geometry', 'rotations', 'linear-algebra', 'euclidean-geometry']"
378486,Conditioning a Poisson process on the number of arrivals in a fixed time,"Let T1 and T5 be the first and fifth arrivals in a Poisson process with rate lambda. (a) Find the conditional density of T1 given that there are 10 arrivals in the time interval (0,1) (b) Find the conditional density of T5 given that there are 10 arrivals in the time interval (0,1) I feel like this question should be really easy but i'm not sure where to get started.","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability', 'conditional-probability']"
