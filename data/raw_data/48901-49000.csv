496436,Construct dense subspace of codimension $n$ for all $n$,"I want to prove the following:
Let $X$ be an infinite dimensional normed space. For all integer $n\geq1$: $X$ has a dense subspace of codimension $n$, i.e. a subspace $L$ such that $\dim(X/L)=n$. How can i do this? My first thought was: Take a basis $e_1,e_2,\ldots$ such that $X=Span(e_1,e_2,\ldots)$ and let $L=Span(e_2,e_3,\ldots)$ than $\dim(X/L)=1$. On the same way you can go on.

496474,Bounding a function on sets with a prescribed measure,"In the proof of a lemma in a paper I'm reading the following is claimed. Let $f$ be a measurable function with $f(t) \geq 0$ for $0 \leq t \leq 1$ and $\int_0^1 f(t)\,dt = 1$.  Let $k$ be a fixed number with $0 \leq k < 1$.  Then we can find an $E \subseteq [0,1]$ with Lebesgue measure $\mu(E) = k$ and a number $p$ such that $$f(t) \leq p \,\text{ for }\, t \in E \,\text{ and }\, f(t) \geq p \,\text{ for }\, t \notin E.$$ Why can we always find such $E$ and $p$ at the same time?

496488,"Universality of $(\mathbb Q,<)$","I have few questions to the proof on Universality of linearly ordered sets. Could anyone advise please?  Thank you. Lemma: Suppose $(A,<_{1})$ is a linearly ordered set and $(B,<_{2})$ is a dense linearly ordered set without end points. Assume $F\subseteq A$ and $E\subseteq B$ are finite and $h:F \to E$ is an isomorphism from $(F,<_{1})$ to $(E,<_{2})$. If $a\in A-F$, then $\exists b\in B-E$ such that $h\cup \left\{(a,b)\right\}$ is an isomorphism from $F \cup \left\{a\right\}$ to $E \cup \left\{b\right\}$. Theorem: Every countable linearly ordered set is embeddable into the linearly ordered set $(\mathbb{Q},<)$ Proof: Let $(A,<_{1})$ be countably linearly ordered set. Let $f:\mathbb{N}\to A$ be a bijection. Fix bijection $g:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$. Define an embedding $h:A\to \mathbb{Q}$. Let $h(f(0))=g(0).$ The Induction hypothesis:$h:\left\{f(i): i<n\right\} \to \left\{h(f(i)): i<n\right\}$ is an isomorphism.

496489,"Examine phase portrait $(f,f')$ for $f""+vf'+\alpha^2f(1-f)=0$ and determine asymptotic behavious of solutions as $x\to \pm \infty$","Find the travelling wave solutions, in the form $u(x,t)=f(x-vt)$, of Fisher's equation $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+a^2u(1-u)$$ where $a>0$ is a constant. Investigate the nature of these solutions by examining the phase-plane $(f,f')$ and show, in particular, that there exist solutions such that $f\to0$ as $x\to-\infty$, $f\to1$ as $x\to\infty$, for all $v\le-2a$. This equation originally arose in a theory of genuine selection in a species (in a paper by Fisher, 1937). It also arise in the theory of combustion, and chemical kinetics. I have the Fisher equation:
$$u_t=u_{xx}+\alpha^2u(1-u)$$
I use the ansatz $u=f(x-vt)$ so that the DE turns into
$$f''+vf'+\alpha^2f(1-f)=0$$
Then I define $x_1=f$ and $x_2=f'$ so that:
$$   \left( \begin{array}{cc} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{array} \right)'= \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1  \\ -\alpha^2(1-x_1) & -v  \end{array} \right)     \left( \begin{array}{cc} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{array} \right)$$
Now I need to examine the nature of the solutions $f$ by examining the phase portrait for $(x_1,x_2)$ and in particular show that there exists solutions such that $f\to0$ as $x\to -\infty$ and $f\to 1$ as $f\to \infty$ for all $v\leq 2\alpha$. I am not sure how to examine the phase portrait here because I have no experience drawing them for non-linear two-dimensional system of differential equations. Also, I am not sure how to show the desired solution exist satisfying $f\to0$ as $x\to -\infty$ and $f\to 1$ as $f\to \infty$ for all $v\leq 2\alpha$. If anyone could help me in solving or give me some hints I would be very grateful. Also if anyone knows of a free software package that can draw phase portraits like this for me I would be very happy. Thanks in advance! UPDATE: NOTE: I decided to not change to $x_1$ and $x_2$ but just keep $f$ and $f'$ instead. Now $f'' = -\alpha^2f(1-f)  -vf'$, then we can write:
$$   \left( \begin{array}{cc} f \\ f' \end{array} \right)'= \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1  \\ -\alpha^2(1-f) & -v  \end{array} \right)     \left( \begin{array}{cc} f \\ f' \end{array} \right)$$\
We can find the stationary points by setting 
$$ \left( \begin{array}{cc} f \\ f' \end{array} \right)' = \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1  \\ -\alpha^2(1-f) & -v  \end{array} \right)     \left( \begin{array}{cc} f \\ f' \end{array} \right) =  \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right)$$
This immediately gives us $f'=0$ and $\alpha^2(1-f)f=0$, so $f$ is either $0$ or $1$. This gives the stationary points for $(f,f')$ as $(1,0)$ and $(0,0)$. Now we can compute the Jacobian in these points, first we write:
$$ \left( \begin{array}{cc} f \\ f' \end{array} \right)' = F(f,f') =  \left( \begin{array}{cc} f' \\ -\alpha^2(1-f)f -vf' \end{array} \right)$$
So the Jacobian $J(F)$ is:
$$J(F)=\left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1  \\ -\alpha^2(1-2f) & -v  \end{array} \right)  $$
So that: $$J(F(0,0))=F_{0,0}=\left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1  \\ -\alpha^2 & -v  \end{array} \right)\ \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \ \  J(F(1,0))=F_{1,0}=\left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1  \\ \alpha^2 & -v  \end{array} \right)  $$
Now we can calculate their eigenvalues using the characteristic polynomials and setting it to 0:
$$\det\left(\lambda I -F_{0,0}\right)      =   \left| \begin{array}{cc} \lambda & -1  \\ \alpha^2 & \lambda+v  \end{array} \right| = \lambda^2 +v\lambda + \alpha^2 = 0 $$
This gives us the eigenvalues of $F$ in the stationary point $(0,0)$ as:
$$\lambda_{1,2}(F_{0,0}) = \frac{-v \pm \sqrt{  v^2 - 4\alpha^2 }}{2}$$
Similarly 
$$\det\left(\lambda I -F_{1,0}\right)      =   \left| \begin{array}{cc} \lambda & -1  \\ -\alpha^2 & \lambda+v  \end{array} \right| = \lambda^2 +v\lambda - \alpha^2 = 0 $$
So
$$\lambda_{1,2}(F_{1,0}) = \frac{-v \pm \sqrt{  v^2 + 4\alpha^2 }}{2}$$ I have a feeling this is incorrect though, because using $v \leq -2\alpha <  0$ both eigenvalues have positve real part which makes them unstable... Also, the fact that im looking for $v \leq -2\alpha (<0) $ leads me to believe that I need to have we need a positive discriminant. This would of course also be the case if $v>2\alpha$ but then $v$ is positive which I guess we dont want. Thanks for any help. I am sorry if this is unclear, plz ask any questions if you would like to know more!! Thanks 2ND UPDATE:
Starting here:
$$ \left( \begin{array}{cc} f \\ f' \end{array} \right)' = F(f,f')=\left( \begin{array}{cc} f_1(x,t) \\ f_2(x,t) \end{array} \right) =  \left( \begin{array}{cc} f'(x,t) \\ -\alpha^2[f(x,t)-f(x,t)^2] -vf'(x,t) \end{array} \right)$$
Remembering that $f=f(x-vt)$, then using the chain rule in a fairly straight forward manner we find that the Jacobian is given by:
$$\left(     \begin{array}{cc} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial t}\\  \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial t}
\end{array}			\right)  =     \left(    \begin{array}{cc}  f'' & -vf'' \\ -\alpha^2(f'-2f) -vf'' & v\alpha^2(f'-2f) +  v^2f''
\end{array}				\right)$$
We have already found that $f'' = -vf' - \alpha^2(f-f^2)$. At the stationary points $(f,f') =(1,0)$ or $(0,0)$ we find that $f''= 0$. Thus at $(1,0)$ the Jacobian is:
$$ F_{(1,0)}= \left(    \begin{array}{cc}  0 & 0 \\ 2\alpha^2  & -2v\alpha^2 
\end{array}				\right)$$
And at $(f,f')=(0,0)$ the Jacobian is:
$$F_{(0,0)} =  \left(    \begin{array}{cc}  0 & 0 \\ 0  & 0 
\end{array}				\right)$$
So we find the eigenvalues:
$$\det(\lambda I - F_{(1,0)})   =   \left|    \begin{array}{cc}  \lambda & 0 \\ -2\alpha^2  & \lambda -2v\alpha^2 
\end{array}				\right| = \lambda^2 - \lambda2 v\alpha^2 $$ So we have a repeated eigenvalue $\lambda_{(1,0)}=2v\alpha^2$. For the stationary point $(0,0)$ the eigenvalues of the Jacobian is $\lambda_{(0,0)}=0$ repeated.
Is this right? I am not sure how to continue form here... I worry that because I am using the notation $f'$ and then differentiating w.r.t. both $x$ and $t$ later on that I might be making mistakes. What I am using is that $f=f(\eta)$ where $\eta =x-vt$ and thus we can just write $f'$ and still differentiate w.r.t. $x$ and $t$ by using the chain rule.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"

  $\text{E}[X^2]$. Note that
  $\text{E}[X(X-1)]=\text{E}[X^2]-\text{E}[X]$. The geometric series
  formula is $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}r^n=\frac{1}{1-r}$$ If you
  differentiate this once and then again you get the useful identities:
  $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty
> nr^{n-1}=\frac{d}{dr}\frac{1}{1-r},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\sum_{n=2}^\infty
> n(n-1)r^{n-2}=\frac{d^2}{dr^2}\frac{1}{1-r}$$ The following is not to
  be turned in. This same ""summation by differentiating"" trick can be
  used in other setting. Take the binomial identity
  $$(x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}x^ky^{n-k}$$ Differentiate with
  respect to $x$, then set $x=p$, $y=1-p$ and you get an identity that
  helps you compute the mean of the binomial distribution. Differentiate
  twice and you get an identity that will lead to the variance. I am not sure where I am going wrong in trying to reach the proper solution.
Can anyone help me to solve this, please?","['probability-distributions', 'probability']"

496815,Why does the derivative not exist at a cusp?,"I'm trying to grasp what's going on at a cusp geometrically. For instance, $y^2=x^3$ is not differentiable at the origin. In $y$ things appear fine: differentiate $y = \pm x^{3/2}$ and we get $y'=0$ regardless of approach from the top or bottom branch. But in $x$, we get the slope $x'$ is $\pm\infty$ depending on approach. But then again, for the circle $y^2+x^2=1$, we get $y' = \pm\infty$ at (1,0) depending on approach from the top or bottom. Yet it's clear that $dy/dx$ exists since, among many reasons, the Jacobian matrix has full rank everywhere. On the surface the two cases seem the same; at some point the derivative wrt to the other variable is 0, and flipping the variable we get two different slopes for the vertical tangent. Either there is some subtle difference or I'm missing something glaringly obvious. I think given any parameterization of the cuspidal cubic that tangent vectors at the origin only point in the negative x direction, while we can get opposite pointing tangent vectors everywhere on the circle depending on our parameterizations, but I'm not sure how to interpret this formally.","['differential-geometry', 'geometry', 'calculus', 'multivariable-calculus']"

\begin{equation*}
u_1=\sin \big(\log (\log |x|^{-1})\big), \quad u_2=\cos \big(\log (\log |x|^{-1})\big).
\end{equation*}I have already shown that $u=(u_1, u_2)\in L^{\infty}(B)\cap H^1(B)$. Further, $u$ has certain second weak derivatives in $B$. Also, 
\begin{equation}
u\in L^{\infty}(B)\cap H^1(B)\cap C^{\infty}(B\setminus\{0\})
\end{equation}and $u$ satisfies the system outside the origin (I have shown this). To show that it is a weak solution, I would like to show that for any $\phi\in L^{\infty}(B)\cap H^1(B)$ with compact support in $B$ I have \begin{equation}
-\int_BDu_i\cdot D\phi\ \mathrm{d}x=\int_B \triangle u_i\phi\ \mathrm{d}x

I started off by noting that if $\phi\in L^{\infty}(B)\cap H^1(B)$ with compact support in $B$, then $T\phi=0$ where $T$ is the trace operator, hence $\phi\in H_0^1(B)=\overline{C_c^{\infty}(B^0)}$. Consequently, there exists a sequence, $\{\phi_m\}_{m=1}^{\infty}\subset C_c^{\infty}(B^0),$ such that 
\begin{equation}
\|\phi_m-\phi\|_{H^1(B)}\rightarrow 0\quad(\text{as }m\rightarrow \infty).

\begin{equation}
-\int_BDu_i\cdot D\phi_m\ \mathrm{d}x=\int_B \triangle u_i\phi_m\ \mathrm{d}x
\end{equation}since $u_i$ has second weak derivatives (in those directions). Then
\begin{equation}
\|Du_i(D\phi_m-D\phi)\|_{L^1(B)}\leq\|Du\|_{L^2(B)}\|D\phi_m-D\phi\|_{L^2(B)}\rightarrow 0
\end{equation}as $m\rightarrow\infty$. Therefore, the left hand side converges to
\begin{equation}
-\int_BDu_i\cdot D\phi\ \mathrm{d}x
\end{equation} for each $i=1, 2$ and now I want to show that the right hand side converges to
\begin{equation}
\int_B\triangle u_i\phi\ \mathrm{d}x

He says that we can assume that X and Y are varieties and $\pi$ is surjective which seems pretty clear to me. But then he says ""This is a local calculation involving local ring of irreducible components so we may assume that X and Y are spectra of fields, Y' is a local artinian ring, and X' is the tensor product that you imagine. I've been trying out to work out the details of that assumption for almost a day now, and i cant seem to reduce the problem to what Fulton says it is reduced. It's even worse because he says that in this case the reults follow form a lemma (fairly straightfoward) that is if $A\to B$ is a local moprhism of local rings, that induces an extension of degree d of residual fields, then the length of a B module seen as an A module is d times the length of the B module seen as a B module. And i'm having the hardest time to see how this lemma implies the statement! To me there should be a sum of length of localisation at minimal prime ideals somewhere to compute the cycle [X']. This leads me to a more general wondering. I'm getting a little bit hopeless after a couple days trying to understand that book. And i thought i had a decent formation in scheme theory. I often have a problem ""reducing a geometric claim to its algebraic content""; like for instance when people say, ""after base change we are left to prove that for a local domain etc...."", this part always seems obscure to me, and i have to work out tediously the details to be convinced of the ""reduction procedures"". Is that supposed to be so? Because Futlon seems so casual about it, like it should be obvious, and if you dont see it, well, there's something that you have failed to understand. In the maths i've done up to now, sometimes i said that something was ""clearly"" so, and i knew that if i wanted to i could work out the details, but i feel, in algebraic geometry, sometimes you cannot chop down an argument into tiny bits, you have to see it or not.

497627,What is nonhomogeneous linear mapping?,"In Milnor's Topology from the differentiable viewpoint , page 3, he said: One thinks of the nonhomogeneous linear mapping from the tangent hyperplane at $x$ to the tangent hyperplane at $y$ which best approximates $f$. Translating both hyperplanes to the origin, one obtains $df_x$. What is nonhomogeneous linear mapping? As far as I know, linear maps are all homogeneous.","['differential-topology', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
497637,Is any permutation the product of two involutions?,"The abstract of this paper says: ""It is well-known that any permutation can be written as a product of two involutions."" I was looking for any web resource that can provide an affirmation and (hopefully easy) proof of this statement -- can anyone please help? And if any permutation can indeed be written as a product of two involutions, are the following guesses correct? If $P$ is a permutation and $X$ & $Y$ are involutions, and $P = XY$, then $P^{-1} = YX$ If $X$ & $Y$ are distinct involutions such that neither is the identity permutation $I$, then the permutation $XY$ is not an involution. The only ways to express any involution $X$ as a product of two involutions is $X = XI$ & $X = IX$ (given that $I$ itself is an involution) Thanks ...","['permutations', 'combinatorics']"
497643,Compute the mean of $(1 + X)^{-1}$ where $X$ is Poisson$(\lambda)$,"Question Let $X$ be Poisson with parameter $\lambda$.  Compute the mean of $(1 + X)^{-1}$. (Introduction to Probability Theory, Hoel, pp. 104) Answer Key The answer key shows that the mean is $\lambda^{-1}(1 - e^{-\lambda})$ My Solution $$E(1 + X)^{-1} = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^\infty (1 + j)^{-1} \dfrac{\lambda^{(1 + j)^{-1}}e^{-\lambda}}{(1 + j)^{-1}!}$$
$$= e^{-\lambda} \sum\limits_{j = 1}^\infty \dfrac{\lambda^{(1 + j)^{-1}}}{((1 + j)^{-1} - 1)!}$$
$$= \lambda^{-1} e^{-\lambda} \sum\limits_{j = 1}^\infty \dfrac{\lambda^{(1 + j)^{-1} - 1}}{((1 + j)^{-1} - 1)!}$$
$$= \lambda^{-1} e^{-\lambda}(e^{\lambda} - 1)$$
$$= \lambda^{-1}(1 - e^{-\lambda})$$ EDIT: I found why I got the answer incorrect.  Thanks for those who answer the question! :)",['probability']
497649,interpret a sum geometrically [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Direct Proof that $1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots+ (2n - 1) = n\cdot n$ (10 answers) Closed 10 years ago . I have this sum: $1+3+5+...+(2n+1)$, where $n$ is a natural number.
I have to calculate it and interpret geometrically.
Well, it's easy to find out that it equals $(n+1)^2$.
But how to interpret it geometrically?
I don't think it's about a graph(parabola).
could you please give me at least an idea?",['algebra-precalculus']

497690,Why are torsion sheaves like effective divisors?,"I'm very new to algebraic geometry, but am trying to read some papers, and am confused by a few things. Let $X$ be a projective surface. My first question is notational: (0) If an author writes 
$$ch_2(E) < c_1^2(E)$$
should I understand this to really mean
$$\int_X ch_2(E) < \int_X c_1(E) \wedge c_1(E)?$$
Because I think of chern classes and chern characters as living in $H^\bullet(X,\mathbb Q)$ and $H^\bullet(X,\mathbb Z)$ respectively, I don't know how else to interpret the inequality. Now let's say $T$ is a torsion sheaf supported in dimension 1. (1) Why is is that $c_1(T)$ is effective? If $T$ locally comes from a quotient $\mathcal O_X/ I$ with no nilpotence, I understand that the locus where functions vanish is cut out by a positive divisor, so $c_1$ is Poincare dual to an effective divisor. But I am not as familiar with the case that $T$ might in general might look define a ring of functions for some ""divisor with infinitesimal neighborhood of order k"". For instance, $\mathbb C[x,y]/x^n$. Second, let's say that F is an ample divisor. (2) Why do I know that $c_1(T) . F > 0$? I know that for curves, I think of ample line bundles as effective divisors, hence (2) follows from (1); but I am uncomfortable with surfaces. The line bundle $L$ corresponding to an ample divisor $F$ eventually has enough global sections to generate it (i.e., $L^{\otimes N}$ is generated by global sections for $N$ large enough) but I am not sure why this implies that $L$ itself must have an effective divisor. A related question might be: How does the divisor $F$ change as you tensor $L$? Third, let's say that $T$ is a torsion sheaf supported in dimension 0. (3) Why is $ch_2(T) > 0$? I believe this is more or less the question (1) above, but in codimension 2.",['algebraic-geometry']

497702,"Do there exist an infinite number of integer-solutions $(x,y,z)$ of $x^x\cdot y^y=z^z$ where $1\lt x\le y$?","Question : Do there exist an infinite number of integer-solutions $(x,y,z)$ of $x^x\cdot y^y=z^z$ where $1\lt x\le y$ ? Motivation : After struggling to find a solution, I've just got one solution, which is 
$$(x,y,z)=(1679616, 2985984, 4478976).$$ In the following, I'm going to write how I got this solution. Letting $d$ be the greatest common divisor of $x,y,z$, we can represent
$$x=ad, y=bd, z=cd$$
where $a,b,c$ are coprimes with each other. Then, we get
$$d^{a+b-c}\cdot a^a\cdot b^b=c^c.$$ In the following, let's consider without the condition $x\le y$. Here, I suppose $$a=2^m, b=3^n, a+b-c=1.$$ (As a result, this supposition works.) Then, we get
$$d=\frac{c^c}{2^{ma}\cdot 3^{nb}}.$$ Hence, letting $c=2^k\cdot 3^l$, if 
$$kc\ge ma=m\cdot 2^m, lc\ge nb=n\cdot 3^n,$$
then $d$ is an integer. Since $(m,n)=(4,2)$ satisfies the above conditions, then we get $d=2^8\cdot 3^6=186624.$ Hence we can get 
$$x=9d=2^8\cdot 3^8=1679616, y=16d=2^{12}\cdot 3^6=2985984, z=24d=2^{11}\cdot 3^7=4478976.$$
Note that here I interchanged $x$ and $y$. P.S : I was surprised to get this solution because I got this almost by chance. So, I don't know the other solutions. If you have any helpful information, please teach me.","['diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"
