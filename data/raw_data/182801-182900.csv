3339164,Simply connected compact Lie groups have even dimension - Where is the mistake?,"I am a bit confused because I think I have a proof for a statement which I think is wrong. The statement is: \begin{equation}
\text{Every compact simply connected Lie group has even dimension.}
\end{equation} However, if I remember correctly $S^3$ has a Lie group structure. I will now elaborate on my ""proof"" for the above statement. Corollary 21.6 in MilnorÂ´s Morse Theory says the following: A simply connected Lie group $G$ with bi-invariant (Riemannnian) metric splits as a cartesian product $G'\times \mathbb{R}^k$ , where $G'$ is compact and the Lie algebra of $G'$ has trivial center. Let now $G$ be a compact simply connected Lie group. As $G$ is compact it posseses a bi-invariant Riemannian metric $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle$ . By the corollary, the Lie algebra $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$ of $G$ has trivial center, i.e. for every non-zero $X\in \operatorname{Lie}(G)$ there exists $Y \in Lie(G)$ s.t. $[X,Y]\neq 0$ . Define a bilinear form $q$ on $Lie(G)$ by $q(X,Y)=[X,Y]$ . As this is bilinear, there ex. a linear transformation \begin{equation}
A: \operatorname{Lie}(G)\to \operatorname{Lie}(G)
\end{equation} such that \begin{equation}
q(X,Y)=\langle AX,Y\rangle \quad \text{for all } X,Y\in \operatorname{Lie}(G).
\end{equation} Since $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$ has trivial center $A$ is injective and hence an automorphism. The fact that $q$ is skew-symmetric translates into \begin{equation}
A^T=-A.
\end{equation} If we denote the dimension of $G$ by $n$ , this implies \begin{equation}
\det(A)=\det(A^T)=(-1)^n\det(A).
\end{equation} However, as $A$ is an automorphism we know $\det(A)\neq 0$ . Therefore, $n$ is even. I would be grateful for clarifications. That can either be pointing out a mistake in my ""proof"" or any other mistake I made. Thanks in advance.","['lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

3339199,Homotopy of integral curves of a gradient field preserves levelsets (?),"Given a differentiable scalar field $f$ on a Riemannian manifold $X$ (with properties as required)
I would like to formulate a homotopy of maximal integral curves $\gamma, \tilde{\gamma}$ of the gradient field $\nabla f$ . Edit : If $X$ has a boundary, i.e. $\partial X \neq \emptyset$ then $f$ shall obey the Neumann boundary condition $g(\mathbf{n}, \nabla f) = 0$ on $ \partial X$ with $\mathbf{n}$ denoting the outward-pointing normal and $g$ the Riemannian metric. I assume the term ""maximal integral curve"" as defined in http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/diffgeomPage/handouts/intcurve.pdf , Theorem 5.1. Edit : For the constructions below I mainly care about the images of $\gamma, \tilde{\gamma}$ so I allow for an arbitrary parametrization of the curves, even if this parametrization does not strictly coincide with the gradient any more (i.e. not in terms of absolute value, but just in terms of direction). Then, without loss of generality, let $\gamma, \tilde{\gamma}$ be parameterized over the unit interval $I$ .
Then I mean in particular a homotopy $H$ : \begin{align} \tag{1}
H(\,\cdot\,, 0) \quad &= \quad \gamma \\
H(\,\cdot\,, 1) \quad &= \quad \tilde{\gamma} \tag{2}\\
\forall t \in I \colon \; H(\,\cdot\,, t) \quad & \text{is a maximal integral curve of $\nabla f$} \tag{3}
\end{align} The requirement of the intermediate states being also maximal integral curves is not usual for a homotopy AFAIK. Also it would not necessarily require the end points of each curve to be the same. First bunch of questions: Is $H$ then actually a homotopy or should I call it rather an isotopy or how else? What would be the proper terminology for this definition? Now what I need is that all curves that are homotopic to an initial maximal integral curve $\gamma_0$ in this sense cross the same level sets of $f$ in the same order. Formally: For every $\gamma$ homotopic to $\gamma_0$ in sense (1)/(2)/(3) there exists a homeomorphism (a reparametrization) $\psi \colon I \longrightarrow I$ such that \begin{equation} \tag{4}
f \circ \gamma = f \circ \gamma_0 \circ \psi
\end{equation} This seems like a triviality as a levelset cannot abruptly end unless it contains critical points of $f$ . But at critical points the maximal integral curves of $\nabla f$ would end and a homotopy could not be continued in first place. Integral curves of $\nabla f$ must cross a level set orthogonally which would not be defined at the boundary of the level set. Second bunch of questions: Is there a more formal argument for this or a known theorem yielding this? Or how would I prove it? Or do I even overlook something and there is a counter example? Given an initial maximal integral curve $\gamma_0$ I suppose there is a well-defined subset $U_0$ of the manifold $X$ consisting of points that lie on any integral curve that is homotopic to $\gamma_0$ in the sense of (1)/(2)/(3). I further suppose that $X$ can be split into disjoint regions $U_j$ in this manner. I.e. such that each region consists of points lying on an integral curve homotopic to an initial integral curve $\gamma_j$ but $\gamma_j$ not homotopic to $\gamma_i$ for $i \neq j$ in sense of (1)/(2)/(3). Third bunch of questions: Is there a proper terminology for this construction, e.g. ""homotopy regions"" of $\nabla f$ or something (maybe related to the ""domain of flow"" from the lecture notes linked above)? Is there a reason to assume that $X$ splits into a finite or at least countable number of these regions $U_j$ ? I guess $X$ would have to be something like a fractal to yield an infinite number of such regions. Final bunch of questions: At the top I wrote ""with properties as required"". What properties are required to make the constructions in this question reasonable? I would prefer to not require $X$ to be compact or bounded, nor to expect that the maximal integral curves would be complete. Further I would like to have this for manifolds with or without boundary. Is that feasible? Does $X$ have to be orientable? Edit: I realized this may require some more regularity assumptions on $f$ . In my use case, $f$ arises as a solution of an elliptic differential equation, thus it should obey a unique continuation property, i.e. $\nabla f$ would not vanish on an open set. $\nabla f$ would vanish almost nowhere on $X$ . I am not sure if $f$ can be assumed to be analytic or if $X$ can. However, $f$ should be twice continuously differentiable as the differential equation is second order. Further, I suppose one can only have finitely many $U_j$ if the set of critical points of $f$ consist only of finitely many connectivity components. I am not sure what role it would play whether $X$ is bounded or not.

3339244,Turning an Abelian Group into a Vector Space,"This question is inspired by the question Are these vector spaces? but is free-standing. Suppose $\mathbb{F}$ is a field, and that $X$ is the multiplicative group of $\mathbb{F}$ . Let us write this abelian group $X$ additively. To be precise the set is $\mathbb{F}\setminus\{0\}$ , the zero element is $\hat{0}:=1$ , the addition operation is $x \hat{+}y:=xy$ , and the negative operation is $\widehat{-}x:=x^{-1}$ . Let $V$ be the abelian group of $n$ -tuples $X^n$ with the usual co-ordinatewise operations. Question : Can we define an $\mathbb{F}$ -scalar multiplication on $V$ so that $V$ becomes an $\mathbb{F}$ -vector space? By looking at $-1$ in $\mathbb{F}$ , which satisfies $(-1)\hat{+}(-1)=(-1)^2=1=\hat{0}$ we see that if there is to be any chance of turning $V$ into a vector space then the field $\mathbb{F}$ must have characteristic $2$ . More than that, a similar argument on $(2^k -1)$ -th roots of unity will show that $\mathbb{F}$ has no finite subfields $\mathbb{F}_{2^k}$ except $\mathbb{F}_2$ . Beyond that I cannot go.","['vector-spaces', 'modules', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"
3339246,Stalk of quasicoherent sheaf on fibre,"Let $\pi: X \to Y$ be a morphism of schemes mapping $x$ to $y$ . Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a qcoh sheaf on $X$ . Consider the fibre $X_y = \pi^{-1}(y)$ , equipped with the natural morphism $i : X_y \to X$ . The point $x$ is in this fibre. We can consider the pullback $i^* \mathscr{F}$ as a sheaf on $X_y$ . I want to show $$
(i^*\mathscr{F})_x = \mathscr{F}_x/\mathfrak{m}_y \mathscr{F}_x.
$$ In particular, when $\mathscr{F} = \mathcal{O}_X$ we get $\mathcal{O}_{X_y, x} = \mathcal{O}_{X,x}/\mathfrak{m}_y \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ . Here $\mathfrak{m}_y$ is the maximal ideal of the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{Y,y}$ . This result is used everywhere but I can't find a reference. I always get my algebra confused when I try to prove it. Here's what I have so far. As we're looking at stalks we can work locally and assume our schemes are affine. This allows us to translate the above into the following algebraic setup. The map $\pi$ corresponds to a ring homomorphism $\varphi : B \to A$ with $\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p}) = \mathfrak{q}$ . The sheaf is an $A$ -module $M$ . The fibre is the (spectrum of) the ring $A \otimes_B k(y) = A_\mathfrak{q}/\mathfrak{q} A_\mathfrak{q}$ . The inclusion of the point $x$ in the fibre $X_y$ corresponds to a homomorphism $\alpha : A \otimes_B k(y) \to k(x)$ , and $x$ is the prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}' = \alpha^{-1}(0) \subset A \otimes_B k(y)$ . Then what I want to show is $$
(A \otimes_B k(y))_{\mathfrak{p}'} = A_\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{q} A_\mathfrak{p}.
$$ The problem is I'm not sure how to do this. Maybe we can construct an explicit isomorphism of rings, but I feel like it would be nicer to use some universal property of localization stuff. Is there an easy/clear way to do this? This is exactly what we want when $\mathscr{F}$ is the structure sheaf, and should imply the result in general. I think $i^* \mathscr{F}$ will correspond to $M \otimes_A A_\mathfrak{q}/\mathfrak{q} A_\mathfrak{q} = M_\mathfrak{q}/\mathfrak{q} M_\mathfrak{q}$ , and then taking the stalk at $x$ with be like tensoring with $A_\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{q} A_\mathfrak{p}$ over $A_\mathfrak{q}/\mathfrak{q} A_\mathfrak{q}$ so we get $M_\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{q} M_\mathfrak{p}$ .","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra']"

Show that u is a constant function. To show that $\nabla u(0) = 0$ , I tried to show that $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}(0) = 0, \forall i$ , but came up with nothing. For example, I know that the partial derivatives are also harmonic functions, so using the mean value theorem i get that: $$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} = \frac{1}{\operatorname{Vol}(r \cdot B^n)}\int_{r \cdot B^n}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}(x) dx
$$ and then I tried to use the divergence theorem on the vector field $F = (0,\ldots,0,u,0,\ldots,0)$ where the $u$ is in the i-th coordinate, so I get: (sorry about the strange formatting of that vector) $$
= \frac{1}{\operatorname{Vol}(r \cdot B^n)} \int_{r \cdot S^{n-1}} \left< \left(\matrix{0\\ \vdots\\u\\ \vdots \\ 0}\right),\frac{x}{r}\right> dS =\frac{1}{\operatorname{Vol}(r \cdot B^n)} \int_{r \cdot S^{n-1}}u \cdot \frac{x_i}{r}dS

Any help will be very appreciated. Do note that this is a question from a past exam in an advanced multivariate calculus class, so we don't have so much claims about harmonic functions and that's why I thought I could find a solution with the divergence theorem. I did find this answer ,
which somehow answers both questions together, but seems like a complete overkill, and probably this is not close to the solution the professor thought of when he wrote the questions and the solution to the second question somehow involves the first question.","['multivariable-calculus', 'harmonic-functions', 'vector-analysis']"

If $f$ has an antiderivative $F: (0,\infty)\to \mathbb{R}$ such that $$F(xy)+xy=xy(f(x)+f(y)),\forall x,y,\in (0,\infty),$$ find $f$ . This problem is from the Romanian magazine ""Gazeta Matematica"", No.6-7-8/2018. I would like you to review my two solutions to this problem and post any others that you may find. Solution 1: For $y=1$ in the given relation we get that $$F(x)+x=xf(x),\forall x\in (0,\infty).(*)$$ From here it follows that $f(x)=\frac{F(x)}{x}+1,\forall x\in (0,\infty)$ and therefore $f$ is differentiable. By differentiating $(*)$ we get that $$f(x)+1=f(x)+xf'(x),\forall x\in (0,\infty)\iff f'(x)=\frac{1}{x},\forall x\in (0,\infty)$$ Hence, $f(x)=\ln x+C$ , $\forall x\in (0,\infty)$ , where C is a constant. Since $f(1)=0$ , it follows that $C=0$ and $f(x)=\ln x,\forall x\in (0,\infty)$ . Solution 2: As in Solution 1, we deduce that $f$ is differentiable, so in particular it is continuous. From $f(x)=\frac{F(x)}{x}+1,\forall x\in (0,\infty)$ , we get that $f(xy)=\frac{F(xy)}{xy}+1,\forall x,y\in (0,\infty)\iff F(xy)+xy=xyf(xy),\forall x,y\in (0,\infty)$ . After substituting this back into the original equation we get that $$xyf(xy)=xy(f(x)+f(y)),\forall x,y\in (0,\infty)\iff f(xy)=f(x)+f(y),\forall x,y\in (0,\infty)$$ Now, this is Cauchy's logarithmic equation and since $f$ is continuous it follows that $f(x)=C\ln x, \forall x\in (0,\infty)$ , where $C$ is a constant.

I claim the sequence becomes periodic, with period $(k+1)$ if $k$ is odd, and $2(k+1)$ if $k$ is even. 
For example, for $k=4$ , and initial values $$
\left(\; f_4(0),f_4(1),f_4(2),f_4(3) \;\right) = (1,2,3,4) \;,

For example, \begin{eqnarray}
f_4(5) &=& f_4(4)-f_4(3)+f_4(2)-f_4(1)\\
f_4(5) &=& 5-4+3-2\\
f_4(5) &=& 2 \;.

  Fibonacci sequences $f_k(n)$ are periodic for any initial values? I can prove that, e.g., $f_4(n)$ is periodic with period $10$ , but only via induction for that specific $k{=}4$ ,

Definition of Weak Solution A weak solution of (NS) is a function, $u$ , on $\Omega \times [0,T)$ such that: (1.) $u \in L^2(0,T' ; H^{1}_{0,\sigma})$ , for all $T' \in (0,T)$ (2.) $u \in L^{\infty}(0,T ; L^{2}_{\sigma})$ (3.) $\int^s_{r} -(u,\partial_{t}\Phi) + (\nabla u , \nabla \Phi) + (u \cdot \nabla u, \Phi) \text{d}t = \int^s_r (f, \Phi) \text{d}t - (u(s), \Phi(s)) + (u(r), \Phi(r))$ for all $0 \leq r \leq s < T$ and all $\Phi \in H^1(r,s; Y)$ . Theorem (Masuda, 1984) There exists a weak solution, $u$ , of (NS). In particular, this function is weak continuous in $L^2_\sigma$ with respect to $t \in [0,T)$ , and $||u(t)||^2_{L^2(\Omega)} + 2 \int^{s}_{0} ||\nabla u(t)||^{2}_{L^2(\Omega)} \text{d}t \leq 2 \int^{s}_{0} (f, u) \text{d}t + ||a||^{2}_{L^2(\Omega)}$ for all $0 \leq t < T$ (Energy Inequality) and $\lim_{t \rightarrow 0}||u(t) - a||_{L^2(\Omega)} = 0 \ \ \ $ (Continuity at $t=0$ ) Here, $(u,f)$ denotes the inner-product of $u$ and $f$ in $L^2(\Omega)$ . That is, $(u,f) = \int_{\Omega} u \cdot f \ \text{d}x$ . We explain the meaning of weak continuity of $u$ . $u$ is weakly continuous in $L^2(\Omega)$ with respect to $t \in [0,T)$ if: $(u(t), g) = \int_{\Omega} u(t) \cdot g \ \text{d}x$ is continuous in $t$ , for all $g \in L^2_\sigma$ . Proof of Existence (Outline) (Please feel free to skip this and see the remaining problem of continuity at $t=0.$ ) I have proven the existence of a weak solution, $u$ , as described in the definition above. I have also shown that this $u$ is weakly continuous in $L^2_\sigma$ with respect to $t$ and satisfies the Energy Inequality. We prove this using a Galerkin Method. We find a countable set $\{\phi_l \}_{l=1}^{\infty} \subseteq C^{\infty}_{0,\sigma}$ whose span is dense in $Y$ and in $L^{2}_{\sigma}$ (with respect to their respective norms). We then define $u_{m}(x,t) = \sum^m_{l=1} c_{ml}(t) \phi_{l}(x)$ , where $c_{ml}$ are solutions in $C^1(0,T)$ to the below locally Lipschitz ODE: \begin{cases}\text{d}_t c_{ml} + \sum^m_{i=1} (\nabla \phi_{i} , \nabla \phi_{l})c_{mi} + \sum^m_{i,j=1} (\phi_i \nabla \phi_{j} , \nabla \phi_{l})c_{mi}c_{mj} = (f,\phi_l), \ \text{for all } l=1,...,m \\
c_{ml}(0) = (a, \phi_l), \ \text{for all } l=1,...,m.
\end{cases} We find that these $u_m$ are uniform bounded in $L^2(0,T' ; H^{1}_{0,\sigma})$ , for all $T' \in (0,T)$ and in $L^{\infty}(0,T ; L^{2}_{\sigma})$ . Thus, since these are Hilbert spaces, there exists subsequences which converge weakly. It is easy to show that $u_m$ convergese to the same function, $u$ , in both spaces. Thus we have satisfied (1.) and (2.) from the definition of Weak Solutions. We can use Arzela-Ascoli to show that this $u$ is weak continuous, as described above. See this previous question for details on the weak convergence and weak continuity of $u$ . Using the weak convergence and definition of $u_m$ , we show that this $u$ satisfies the Energy Inequality. Using weak convergence and several Lemmas from Masuda's paper, we show that $u$ satisfies the integral equation (3.) from the definition of Weak Solutions. Last Remaining Problem, Continuity in $L^2$ at $t=0$ It remains only to show that $\lim_{t \rightarrow 0}||u(t) - a||_{L^2(\Omega)} = 0$ . In fact, Masuda makes no mention of this property in his proof of the theorem!!! We know that $u$ is weakly continuous with respect to $t$ , as explained above. Also, by the definition of $u_m$ , each $u_m$ is continuous with respect to $t$ . That is, $u_m \in C((0,T); L^2_{\sigma})$ , for all $m$ . I suspect this should be enough to obtain the final result, but I am struggling to show it without requiring uniform continuity. Here is my initial attempt to prove: $\lim_{t \rightarrow 0}||u(t) - a||_{L^2(\Omega)} = \lim_{t \rightarrow 0}(u(t) - a, u(t) - a) $ $ = \lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty}(u(t) - a, u_{m}(t)) - (u_{m}(t) - a, a)$ By an earlier step in the existence proof, we know that $(u_{m}(t), g)$ converges as $m \rightarrow \infty$ uniformly with respect to $t$ . (Again, see this previous question for details.) Thus the term on the right, $(u_{m}(t) - a, a)$ , converges uniformly with respect to $t$ . Therefore, we are able to swap the position of the limits in $t$ and $m$ . By definition of $u_m$ , it is clear that $\lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} ||u_m(t=0)||_{L^2(\Omega)} = ||a||_{L^2(\Omega)}$ , so the term on the right vanishes. We are stuck with the term on the left, $\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty}(u(t) - a, u_{m}(t))$ . As demonstrated in another previous question , we know that, for each fixed $m$ , this is continuous in $t$ . So we would be able to show that this term vanishes, if we are able to swap the limits in $t$ and $m$ . I know we could do this if we have uniform convergence again, but I am not sure if this is possible, as we now have dependence on $t$ for both sides of the inner-product. We do have uniform boundedness of this term, as the $u_m$ are uniformly bounded in $L^2(0,T' ; H^{1}_{0,\sigma})$ , for all $T' \in (0,T)$ and $L^{\infty}(0,T ; L^{2}_{\sigma})$ , so we could obtain uniform convergence by showing equicontinuity. But I'm not sure if this can be done. In short, the question is as follows: can we swap the limits in $t$ and $m$ in $\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty}(u(t) - a, u_{m}(t))$ ? Or is there another way to show that $\lim_{t \rightarrow 0}||u(t) - a||_{L^2(\Omega)} = 0$ ?","['weak-convergence', 'real-analysis', 'lp-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

A base case for this would be n=0: $f(2^0+1)=f(1+1)=f(2)=f(1)=1$ , with the end result, 1, being equal to n+1 (in this case, 0+1) Next, suppose that we already know that $f(2^n+1)=n+1$ . Through induction, it suffices to show that $f(2^{n+1}+1)=n+2$ . Since $2^{n+1}+1$ is odd, we have: $f(2^{n+1}+1)=f(2^n)+f(2^n+1)=1+(n+1)=n+2$ . The second part of the equality above was reached using the fact that $f(2n+1)=f(n)+f(n+1)$ . This completes our induction. We have shown that $f(2^n+1)=n+1$ for all positive integers (including 0).

3340545,Intuition for Freudenthal Suspension,"One version of the Freudenthal suspension theorem is the following: Suppose a CW complex $X$ is a union of two subcomplexes $A,B$ with $A\cap B\neq\emptyset$ connected and nonempty. If $(A,A\cap B)$ is $m$ -connected and $(B,A\cap B)$ is $n$ -connected, then $$\pi_k(A,A\cap B)\cong \pi_k(X,B)$$ for $k<m+n$ . Further, $\pi_{m+n}(A,C)$ surjects onto $\pi_{m+n}(X,B)$ . One can find proofs of this in Hatcher (theorem $4.23$ ) and Dieck (proposition $6.4.1$ ). My goal is to find some intuition for why this is true. The corresponding statement in homology is excision, and the proof is fairly intuitive (although tedious). To show $$H_n(A,A\cap B)\cong H_n(A\cup B,B),$$ one can pretty easily hand-wave that, after subdivision, simplices in $A$ but not $A\cap B$ are the same as simplices in $A\cup B$ but not $B$ . Hatcher's proof of Freudenthal suspension is vaguely reminiscent of this subdivision argument as well. By analogy, I have some intuition for why we have $\pi_k(A,A\cap B)\cong \pi_k(X,B)$ . My main (soft) questions are the following: What is it about homotopy groups that makes excision fail in the first place? There are examples here, but I still can't really visualize them. What is the significance of $m+n$ ? This is my biggest source of confusion, because I really can't come up with any hand-waving argument that justifies the appearance of $m+n$ . The best hand-waving I have come up with is fairly pathetic: take a map $(D^{m+n},\partial D^{m+n})\to (X,B)$ , and apply some simplicial structure so that the map is locally linear. Since $(A,A\cap B)$ is $m$ -connected, you need to use $m+1$ of the dimensions to get into $A\setminus A\cap B$ (whatever that means). But then there are $n-1$ dimensions left, so they must map into $A\cap B$ . I don't even expect that to make sense to other people, and the dimensions are still off by one anyway.

In a lot of texts on algebraic geometry, when $V=k^n$ , then the coordinate ring $k[k^n]$ is identified as the polynomial ring $k[x_1,\cdots ,x_n]$ This definition makes sense when the field is infinite. In that case, $I(V)=\{0\}$ , so every equivalence class in $k[x_1,\cdots ,x_n]/I(V)$ has exactly one element, hence $$k[k^n]\cong k[x_1,\cdots ,x_n]/\{0\}\cong k[x_1,\cdots ,x_n]$$ But what if $k$ is finite?

Since the functions $f=x^2+x$ and $g=x^4+x^3+x^2+x$ (and more) vanish on $\mathbb{F}_2$ , we must have the equivalence class $[0]$ has more than one element (in fact, infinitely many) In this case, is it still appropriate to identify the coordinate ring to the polynomial ring?

Are there any generalizations to $3\times 3$ or higher determinants? The last result, which states that $p\Re (q)=1$ , is also quite interesting. How to interpret this result? To summarize, this question seems to be tackling a very deep theory in geometry in an elementary way. I try to find more about this in complex methods textbooks, but I have not found any.

What is that lemma/proposition/step where 2 is excluded in such a way that Wiles' proof does not imply that Pythagorean triples are impossible?

The simplicity of $A_n$ for $n\geq 5$ is what makes quintics (and higher degree polynomials) fundamentally different from quartics and lower degree polynomials, and allows us to use Galois Theory to show that these higher degree polynomials are unsolvable.""

One number that stands out is $$x = 10^5 + \frac{1}{10}\cdot\Big(\frac{3}{5}\Big)^2.$$ Surprisingly, $f(x)$ is almost equal to $\frac{2}{3}$ , as the first $12,897$ binary digits of both numbers agree. Just after that, they disagree. You don't need a sophisticated algorithm to check this. Just compute $\mbox{sgn}(\sin kx)$ for $k=1, 2, \cdots, 12,897$ . These signs alternate perfectly depending on whether $k$ is odd or even, just like the binary digits of $\frac{2}{3}$ . Question I started to have some doubts about the fact that if $x$ is rational, then the sequence $z_k = \mbox{sgn}(\sin kx)$ can not be periodic. Can someone prove that I am right, and that this weird number $x$ is just a coincidence, not leading to periodicity anyway. Do you have some explanation for these coincidences for so many different $f(x)$ values: very often, 20 or 30 binary digits match those of a simple rational, sometimes 40 and even 87 digits for the number $x=10^5$ itself -- but no pattern for $x=10^5-1, x=10^5-\frac{1}{10}, \mbox{ or } x = 10^5+1$ . A pattern again for $x=2\cdot 10^5$ and for so many other numbers, starting with $x=1$ resulting in $f(x)=0.11111113\cdots$ (in base $10$ ). Update Another number leading to almost periodicity is $x=\log_2 3$ resulting in $f(x) = 2/5$ (almost). But $x=\sqrt{2}/2$ does not yield the same spectacular result. It is a hit and miss. Finally, try $x=\frac{355}{113}$ . The first $11776655$ binary digits of $f(x)$ are identical to those of $\frac{2}{3}$ . Not only $11776655$ is large, but even more surprising, look at the base- $10$ digits of $11776655$ : two $1$ , two $7$ , two $6$ , two $5$ . Note that if you concatenate the base- $10$ digits of $355$ with those of $113$ , you get $113355$ .","['approximation', 'number-theory', 'irrational-numbers', 'sequences-and-series', 'recreational-mathematics']"

3341686,Colouring the elements of a group such that $x$ and $gx$ have different colours.,"$\mathbf{Question:}$ Let $G$ be a finite group and $g\in G$ be an element of even order. Prove that the elements of the group can be coloured using two colours in such a way that $x$ and $gx$ have different colours $\forall x\in G$ . $\mathbf{Attempt:}$ By Lagrange's theorem, $G$ is of even order, say $2n$ . We ""bifurcate"" $G$ into two equal halves, say $A= \{x_1,x_2,...,x_n\}$ and $B=\{y_1,y_2,...y_n\}$ , where $x_1=e$ and $y_i=gx_i, \ 1\leq i \leq n$ . So, $y_1=g$ , $A\cup B=G$ and $A\cap B=\emptyset$ Clearly, $\phi_1:A \to B$ defined by $\phi_1(x_i)=gx_i$ is an injection, consequently, it is a bijection. Again, $\phi_2:B \to A$ defined by $\phi_2(y_i)=gy_i=g^2x_i$ sends $x_i's$ back to $A$ . If we give the elements of $A$ the same colour and the elements of $B$ another, the colouring is done.

3341701,Is equicontinuity independent of the chosen metric of the state space,"There already exist several posts on similar questions, but I could not find any, which really gives a precise answer to my problem. Let $A \subseteq C([0,T],E)$ , where $E$ is a topological space and C $([0,T],E)$ denotes the set of all continuous functions from $[0,T]$ to $E$ . Assume I am given a metric on $E$ , let me call it $d$ , which induces the prescribed topology on $E$ . Then, equicontinuity of $A$ means $sup_{f \in A}d(f_{t_n},f_t) \to 0$ for each $t \in [0,T], (t_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converging to $t$ . One usually does not find this as the definition of equicontinuity, but I think this is an equivalent way to express it, right? Now, suppose someone considers a topologically (i.e. ""weakly"") equivalent metric, $\rho$ , on $E$ . Is equicontinuity of $A$ invariant under switching between such equivalent metrics? Intuitively, this should be the case, but I would very much like to have clarification for it. Thanks in advance!","['equicontinuity', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis', 'metric-spaces']"

This statement is true for the following borderline cases: If $X_{1, 1}$ is uniformly distributed on $G$ , then $H$ is equal to $G$ . This is because if $A$ and $B$ are two independent uniformly distributed random elements of a finite group, then $AB$ is also uniformly distributed. If $X_{1, 1}$ is degenerate ( $\exists g \in G$ , such that $P(X_{1, 1} = g) = 1)$ ), then $H$ is trivial, as $\forall g \in G$ $g^{ord(g)} = e$ by definition of group element order.

3341823,Prove that an integer $a$ which satisfies the equation $a^2=1+2b^2$ for integer $b$ is of the form $a=c^2\pm1$ for some integer $c$,"This question is a bit involved so thanks for your patience. After a lot of work I could show that each $b$ that satisfies this equation corresponds to another smaller integer say $s$ which satisfies the equation. here are the formulas for the solutions. $$t=s\pm\sqrt{2s^2+1}\tag{1}$$ $$x=3t\pm2\sqrt{2t^2-1}\tag{2}$$ $$y=\pm\sqrt{tx-1}\tag{3}$$ $$b=2x+y\tag{4}$$ $$a=3x+y\tag{5}$$ for nonzero $t$ and $x$ . Let $x_+$ and $x_-$ denote the $x$ with the positive sign and negative sign respectively and define $y_+$ and $y_-$ similarly. Use the following rules: If you choose positive $t$ not $1$ you may  choose any one of the $x$ s, but you must choose $y_+$ if you take $x_+$ . If $t=1$ you may take both $x$ s and with $x_+$ you must choose only $y_+$ . If you take $t$ positive and choose $x_-$ you must choose $y_-$ , this last solution repeats the previous solutions but it generates one the others don't when $s=2$ , $t=5$ , $x_-=1$ , $y_-=-2$ , $b=0$ , $a=1$ . There are similar rules for negative $t$ but they are just the negatives of the previous solutions. I (think) I could prove that no $s$ can lead to a $b=s$ since all solutions either get smaller or larger but the absolute value always increases except for the case I singled out which leads to $b=0$ , which implies that this is the complete set of solutions. I noticed that the values of $b$ increase and at some point they reach a constant ratio which is roughly $\phi=93222358/15994428$ and I used this to derive the function $$f(x)=\phi^{\left(x-11\right)}93222358$$ which is extremely accurate at first and almost exact for $x\ge7$ . It gives the $x$ -th nonzero value of $b$ where the zeroth value is just $0$ . Here's where it gets interesting, I noticed a pattern among the $a$ s, that for nonzero even $x$ , $a$ can be written in the form $a=c_1^2-1$ and for odd $x$ , $a=\ c_2^2+1$ . I checked this until $x=15$ and it holds. Also, another reason to believe that $a$ can't be a square is that while I was trying to prove Fermat's last theorem for $n=4$ (where this equation came up), I could reduce the proof to verifying that that no such $a$ can be a square. Of course, I'm a lot more interested now than when I first encountered the equation and I want to prove this pattern.","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'diophantine-equations']"
