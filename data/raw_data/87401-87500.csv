I know that the word ""conformal"" can mean different things: sometimes it means the derivative is nonzero; sometimes the function should be injective; and sometimes the word is synonymous to biholomorphic.  I also know that if the word mean ""biholomorphic"", such a map has to be a linear fractional transformation of the form $e^{i\theta}(z - a)/(1 - \bar a z)$, in which case the conditions are so restricted that I imagine such a map doesn't exist. Do maps that satisfied the condition above exist, possibly depending on what you mean by ""conformal""? EDIT: clarification in bold.","['conformal-geometry', 'complex-analysis']"

1167658,Probability of the Center of a Square Being Contained in A Triangle With Vertices on its Boundary,"Background : I happen to love solving tough problems. Problem is, I simply cannot answer some! It happened again today, as I attempted to solve the questions in this site: http://www.skytopia.com/project/imath/imath.html This site seems to have really, really difficult questions, and in fact, I'm struggling to answer the second question! That struggle is not without reason, as you shall understand after reading the below question... The Question is: 3 points are chosen at random along the square's outline. They then combine to form a triangle. What is the probability that the centre of the square will be 'engulfed' by this triangle? My effort: I divided the square as below (I tried my best people,- assume the gaps between the line segments are points; I've been only ably to name the vertices of the square), - a1 a2 a3 a4

                                 c1 c2 c3 c4 After having made these divisions and naming them accordingly... Considering point to be random, evaluated the probability of a point lying on any one of the sixteen segments to be 1/16. Realised centre of the square is engulfed in some cases of 3 points lying on (some examples):- _(a1,b3,c3);(a2,b4,c4);(a3,c1,d1);(a4,c2,d2)_
_(b1,c3,d3);(b2,c4,d4);(b3,d1,a1);(b4,d2,a2)_

_(d1,a3,b3);(d2,a4,b4);(d3,b1,c1);(d4,b2,c2)_ Realised that I'm not accounting for so many more favourable cases (Not able to aptly apply concept of permutation and combination in this question). Realised that I'm not able to calculate the sample space. Realised that the answer is much tougher to compute because I'm not accounting for special cases of collinearity, as well as cases where the vertices and points of separation in my diagram (Not able to assign those points any segment; even if one for each, square's vertices cause problems when evaluating cases, preventing successful generalisation) A convincing, ingenious, enlightening and accurate solution to question bolded above will be immensely appreciated.","['geometric-probability', 'calculus', 'probability']"

1167723,"Qing Liu's definition of an algebraic variety, a non-separated line","First, a little reminder. In Qing Liu's Book on algebraic Curves, algebraic varieties are defined as Let $k$ be a field. An affine variety over $k$ is the affine scheme
  associated to a finitely generated algebra over $k$.  An algebraic variety over $k$ is
  a $k$-scheme $X$ such that there exists a covering by a finite number of affine open
  subschemes $X_i$ which are affine varieties over $k$. A projective variety over $k$ is
  a projective scheme over $k$. a little later, he describes the well-known example (Example 3.3.8) of the line with a doubled point at the origin (see also Hartshorne, II.2.3.6): $$

Hence $$G\equiv(\frac {a^2+b^2}{a}\sec\theta,0), \, G'\equiv(0,\frac {a^2+b^2}{b}\tan\theta)$$ C is the origin and CF is perpendicular to the normal. Hence $$ CF\equiv b\,x\sec\theta-a\,y\tan\theta=0\implies y=\frac {b\,x\sec\theta}{a \tan\theta}$$ Substituting this in the equation of the normal we get $$a\,x\cos\theta+b \,\cot\theta\,\frac {b\,x\sec\theta}{a\,\tan\theta}=a^2+b^2\ $$ implies $$ (a^2 \cos\theta \sin^2\theta+ b^2\cos\theta)x=(a^2+b^2)\sin^2\theta$$ After finding the coordinates of F, the calculation becomes very complicated.

1167988,"For normed vectorspaces $V$, $A,B \subset V$ if $A$ is compact and $B$ is closed then $A+B$ is closed","I am looking for a 'direct' way to show the following statement: Problem : Let $V$ be a normed vectorspace, show that if $A$ is compact and $B$ is closed then $A+B:= \lbrace a+b \mid a \in A, b \in B \rbrace$ is closed My approach : I am trying to show this statement directly i.e. premise $\implies$ conclusion. This was ridiculously easy for $A,B$ compact $\implies A+B$ compact. I don't seem to have much luck with this one though. Let $(x_n)$ be a convergent sequence in $A+B$ such that $x_n \to x$. If I manage to show that $x \in A+B$ then I am done. It is true that $x_n = a_n + b_n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $(a_n,b_n) \in A \times B$. Luckily I have that $A$ is compact, that means that there exists a subsequence $(a_{n_k})$ of $(a_n)$ such that $a_{n_k} \to a \in A$ thanks to  compact $\equiv $ bound & closed and Bolzano-Weierstrass. Now I fail to make any statement about the sequence $(b_n) \in B$. I know that if $(b_n)$ converges, then thanks to $B$ being closed it follows that the limiting point would also be a member of $B$. However it feels rather vague to me to say that $(b_n)$ converges because $(x_n) \in A + B$ converges. Could someone give me some nudges in the right direction? Or do I need to forfeit the direct approach and try to come up with a contradiction if I assume $x \notin A+B$?

(Indeed, with hindsight, I have to admit that the connection is ""obvious"", especially because it follows from an elementary trigonometric identity I already used yesterday.)

1168043,Why can you chose how to align infinitely long equations when adding them?,"I saw in a video this proof: Take this equation: $$f=1+\frac12+\frac14+\cdots$$ and do this: $$\begin{align}
f&=1+1/2+1/4+\cdots\\
-\quad f/2&=\quad\:\:\:1/2+1/4+\cdots\\
\hline
f/2&=1+0+0+\cdots
\end{align}$$ This bugs me, and here's why. $$f/2=1/2+1/4+\cdots$$ We took this equation, but shifted it 1 spot over, effectively making it smaller. Here's what I mean by shifting. Here's the same thing, but without anything shifted. $$\begin{align}
f&=\:\:\:\:1+1/2+1/4+\cdots\\
-\quad f/2&=1/2+1/4+1/8+\cdots\tag{1}\\
\hline
f/2&=1/2+1/4+1/8+\cdots
\end{align}$$ 1: Now this part isn't shifted anymore. Basically by shifting, I'm talking about how we align the equations. I don't like the shifting part and here's why. If we take the equation $f=1+1+1+\cdots$ and do a similar thing, first without shifting. $$\begin{align}
f&=1+1+1+\cdots\\
-\quad f&=1+1+1+\cdots\\
\hline
0&=0+0+0+\cdots

Is there something I'm doing wrong in my example? Am I just not understanding infinity correctly?

Since $f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ it must attain its bounds on $[0,1]$. Now, by mean-value theorem, there exists $c_x\in[0,x]$ such that $\int_0^xf(t)dt=f(c_x)x$. Now we have $\dfrac{|f(x)|}{x}\leq f(c_x)$. Taking $x\to0$ we have LHS is unbounded while RHS is bounded and so this is a contradiction.

I am well aware that you can easily see why this is the case with math . I mean, even in the 2-D case, take a square with side length $1$, and it has a perimeter of $4$ and an area of $1$. Now take a rectangle with side lengths $0.5$ and $1.5$, then the perimeter is $4$, but now the area is $0.75$. But where did all the extra area go? We have the same amount of material there. Intuitively I'd like to say that the same area is covered, but it's just distributed differently, but this clearly isn't the case. I know that different shapes with the same surface area have different volumes, but I can't picture why. I can take a sheet of (ideal) paper, turn it to a sphere, and then turn it into a cube, and they'll have different volumes, despite using the same sheet of paper.

$x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)\cdot (x^2 - xy + y^2) = 35$. The only integer factors of $35$ are $(1, 35)$ or $(5, 7)$. There are no integers $x$ and $y$ that add to $1$, so $x + y = 5$ or $7$. Using $x + y = 5$ we get that $y = 5 - x$, so $y^3 = 125 - 75x + 15x^2 - x^3$ so
$x^3 + y^3 = 15x^2 - 75x + 125 = 35$
or
$$15x^2 - 75x + 90 = 0$$
$$x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$$
$$(x - 3)(x - 2) = 0$$
So $x = 2$ or $x = 3$
Thus $y = 3$ or $y = 2$ respectively. Using $x + y = 7$ we get that $y = 7 - x$, so $y^3 = 343 - 147x + 21x^2 - x^3$ so
$$x^3 + y^3 = 21x^2 - 147x + 343 = 35$$
$$21x^2 - 147x + 308 = 0$$
$$3x^2 - 21x + 44 = 0$$
or
$$x = \frac{21 \pm \sqrt{-87}}{6}$$

1168635,Why are 1 and -1 eigenvalues of this matrix?,"This is a subject I've been working on for a very long time now, but still did not manage to fully understand the interesting properties of this matrix. I have already asked a (viewed but unanswered) question about the same matrices ( cf. here ), but the question here is different. First, let's define two matrices: $\mathbf{N}$ is the following matrix:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{N}=\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{I}_n & \mathbf{0}_n \\  \mathbf{0}_n & \mathbf{P}^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}1 & && \\ & \ddots && \\ & & 1& \\ &&& -1 \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{P}  \end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{2n\times2n}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{P}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is any invertible matrix. with $\omega_i>0$ and $t>0$, the block-diagonal matrix:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S}(t)=\begin{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega_1t) & \\& \ddots & \\ & & \cos(\omega_n t) \end{bmatrix} & \begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{\sin(\omega_1t)}{\omega_1} & \\& \ddots & \\ & & \dfrac{\sin(\omega_nt)}{\omega_n} \end{bmatrix} \\
\begin{bmatrix}  -\omega_1 \sin(\omega_1t) & \\& \ddots & \\ & & -\omega_n\sin(\omega_n t) \end{bmatrix} &  \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega_1t) & \\& \ddots & \\ & & \cos(\omega_n t) \end{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{2n\times2n}
\end{equation} The eigenvalues of $\mathbf N$ are of course 1 (multiplicity $2n-1$) and $-1$ (multiplicity $1$). The eigenvalues of $\mathbf{S}(t)$, which is an exponential matrix, are the $n$ couples of the complex conjugates $(\exp(i\omega_jt),\overline{\exp(i\omega_jt)})$. Now, we can define $\forall t>0$, $\mathbf{A}(t)=\mathbf N\mathbf S(t)$. We know that the product of the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}(t)$ is the product of those of $\mathbf{N}$ and $\mathbf S(t)$, i.e. $-1$. I observe an interesting property but can't prove where it stems from: $1$ and $-1$ are eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{A}(t)$ ($\forall t$); $1$ and $-1$ are $\color{red}{\text{not}}$  eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{A}(t_2)\mathbf{A}(t)$ ($\forall t,t_2$, except maybe for specific values of $\mathbf P$ and $\omega_k$); $1$ and $-1$ are eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{A}(t_3)\mathbf{A}(t_2)\mathbf{A}(t)$ ($\forall t,t_2,t_3$); $1$ and $-1$ are $\color{red}{\text{not}}$  eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{A}(t_4)\mathbf{A}(t_3)\mathbf{A}(t_2)\mathbf{A}(t)$ ($\forall t,t_2,t_3,t_4$, except maybe for specific values of $\mathbf P$ and $\omega_k$); $\dots$ I managed to prove $1$ and $-1$ are eigenvalues of  $\mathbf{A}(t)$ by considering $\mathbf{S}(t)\pm\operatorname{diag}(1,\dots,1,-1,\dots,1)$, calculating its kernel, and building the appropriate vectors (without having to calculate them explicitly ). Also, I understand that the product of the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}(t_2)\mathbf{A}(t)$ is 1, while that of $\mathbf{A}(t_3)\mathbf{A}(t_2)\mathbf{A}(t)$ is -1, but that does not prove anything. Questions 1) Any suggestion to prove the framed observation would be very welcome: why are apparently 1 and -1 eigenvalues of $\prod_{i=1}^m A(t_i)$ if and only if $m$ is odd? 2) Also, I have the impression that there exists a powerful mathematical framework to study these matrices, but I can't figure out which one, as not being a mathematician; Lie algebra because $\mathbf S(t)$ is an exponential? Galois groups because the eigenvalues are complex conjugate? Zariksi topology because @loup blanc mentioned it (see end of answer)? Edit A simple Mathematica file to reproduce the results is available here . Just play with the arguments of calculateEigenvals to change the dimension $n$ or/and the exponent $m$ (to prove: 1,-1 eigenvalues iff $m$ is odd).","['zariski-topology', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"

First, I found this 6-year-old solution to a problem very similar to mine here at MathHelpForum, but on closer inspection I think not only the author left lots of gap, but also I am not sure if this is a correct solution, and on top of it I do not really understand it. And then internally in MSE, I found this 2012's posting and also this 2013's posting , which are similar but not exactly the same.

I forget to include definition to Lebesgue measurability and Lebesgue measurable function until @PhoemueX brought it up.

Let $\mathcal l(I) = b - a$ if $I = (a, b]$ ... Define $\mu^*$ as an outer measure... however, that if we restrict $\mu^*$ to a $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal L$ which is strictly smaller than the collection of all subsets of $\mathbb R$ , then $\mu^*$ will be a measure on $\mathcal L$ . That measure is what is known as Lebesgue measure. The $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal L$ is called the Lebesgue $\sigma$ -algebra .... A set is Lebesgue measurable if it is in the Lebesgue $\sigma$ -algebra. If $X$ is a metric space, $\mathcal B$ is the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra, and $f: X \to \mathbb R$ is measurable with respect to $\mathcal B$ , we say $f$ is Borel measurable.

Some versions of Morera's theorem weaken the hypothesis to say every curve consisting of the sides of a rectangle with each side parallel to either the real axis or the imaginary axis.  Some use triangles or circles.  A question arises: which classes of curves can serve? The usual simple proof says $f(z)=\frac d {dz} \int_{x_0}^z f(w)\,dw$ where $z_0$ is some base point, and uses the hypothesis to show that the integral does not depend on which path is taken from $z_0$ to $z$.  Then one must use the fact that derivatives of holomorphic functions are holomorphic, a proposition whose proof requires some work. Thus it may at first appear that one must use some class of curves that can connect any chosen base point to any other point in the domain.  But I think one could make a slight variant of the proof work if one simply assumed $\int_\gamma f(z)\,dz=0$ whenever $\gamma$ is a circle of radius $<0.0001$ within the domain. So: Which classes of curves will serve? Is there some nice simple proof that doesn't use an arbitrary choice of base point and that makes the answer to that first question obvious?",['complex-analysis']

1169267,Reduction of Factoring to Order Finding,"Theorem Let $N$ be a general odd number, which written as its prime factorisation is $N = {p_1}^{\alpha_1} {p_2}^{\alpha_2} \dots {p_s}^{\alpha_s}$. If $x$ is chosen uniformly at random from $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_N$ (group of numbers coprime to $N$) and $r$ is the order of $x$ modulo N. Then
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{P} [r\text{ is even and }x^{r/2} \not\equiv -1 \text{ mod } N] \geq 1 - \frac{1}{2^{s}}
\end{equation} Proof We need to show that,
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{P} [r\text{ is odd or }x^{r/2} \equiv -1 \text{ mod } N] \leq \frac{1}{2^s}
\end{equation*} The Chinese remainder theorem states that $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_N \cong \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{{p_1}^{\alpha_1}} \times \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{{p_2}^{\alpha_2}} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{{p_s}^{\alpha_s}}$ from which we can deduce that choosing $x$ uniformly at random from $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_N$ is equivalent to choosing $x_i$ uniformly at random from $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{{p_j}^{\alpha_j}}$. Let $r_j$ be the order of $x_j$ modulo ${p_j}^{\alpha_j}$ and let $2^{m_j}$ be the largest power of $2$, which divides $r_j$. So $k_j 2^{m_j} = r_j$ and $k_j$ odd. Assume that $r$ is odd, which implies that $r_j$ must be odd for each $j$ (so $m_j = 0$), which occurs with probability $2^{-s}$ (from a previous result). Now assume that $r$ is even, but $x^{r/2} \equiv -1 \text{ mod } N$. Then $x^{r/2} \equiv -1 \text{ mod } {p_j}^{\alpha_j}$. This implies that $r_j$ does not divide $\dfrac{r}{2}$, to see this suppose $r_j \Big| \dfrac{r}{2} \implies cr_j = \dfrac{r}{2}$ and therefore $x_j^{r/2} \equiv x_{j}^{cr_j} \equiv (x_{j}^{r_j})^c \equiv 1 \text{ mod } {p_j}^{\alpha_j} \not\equiv -1 \text{ mod } {p_j}^{\alpha_j}$ giving a contradiction. Therefore we must have that all $m_j$ are equal to a common value $m$. It is proving this final statement where I am stuck. The notes, which I am using say; ""Because $r_j$ all divide $r$ and in fact $r$ is a common multiple of the $r_j$, so if one of the $m_j$ has an extra power of $2$ removing this the others should still divide $\dfrac{r}{2}$. But we have shown this is not true."" My Attempt of a Proof (WLOG $r_1$ has extra power of $2$)
\begin{align*}
r &= c r_1 r_2 \dots r_s \text{(since r is common multiple)}\\
r &= c (k_1 2^{m+1}) r_2 \dots r_s \\
\dfrac{r}{2} &= c (k_1 2^{m}) r_2 \dots r_s
\end{align*}
and therefore $r_j, \Big| \dfrac{r}{2}$ for $j = 2 \dots s$ the contradiction. However, surely we can repeat this proof when all $m_j$ are equal an obtain the same contradiction?
So where I am going wrong?","['order-theory', 'number-theory']"

1169308,Showing two forms on a manifold are equal,"Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be two forms on a manifold $M$. To show that they are equal, does it suffice to show that for arbitrary $p\in M$ there exists some chart such that $\alpha_p=\beta_p$. I was told that this is not sufficient. For example, for $f\in C^\infty(M)$, in normal coordinates $x^1,\dots,x^n$ centered at $p$, only at $p$ do we have that the laplacian $\Delta f$ is $$\Delta_pf=\sum_{i,j}g^{ij}(p)\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i\partial x_j}.$$But I was told this equality is only at $p$ and it is not true that as functions on $M$ these two are equal. I don't understand why not, don't they agree at each point meaning they're the same? What confuses me further is that I was told on a complex manifold it is true that as global functions $$\Delta f=2\sum_{j,k}g^{j\overline k}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z_j\partial \overline z_k}.$$Does the above argument work in normal coordinates on a complex manifold for some reason?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

1169409,Formula to best fit a rectangle inside another by scaling,"I am very weak in Math. I am a web programmer, and usually my work does not involve too much math - it's more of putting records into databases, pulling out reports, making those fancy web pages etc etc. So, I got a task that is ""mathy"" for me, but I am hoping it's child's play for some of you Math guys out there, and you will help me out... It might even be an interesting problem for you, its just too complex for me. So recently I got this task, where I am given an image with an area marked on top of it. This area would be marked as top left pixels (x1,y1) and bottom right pixels (x2,y2)
So for the image I have the following information: Image Width (iw)
Image Height (ih)
Image Area Top Left (x1,y1)
Image Area Bottom Right (x2,y2) Now there are a collection of frames, each frame will have Frame Width (fw) and Frame Height (fh) . My job is to find optimal way to fit Image Area inside frame without having any blank area inside frame, using image scaling if required. So I broke it down to following tasks: Image Area (not fill image) has to fit inside Frame. If Image Area > Frame , I should scale Image down (to a %). If Image Area < Frame I should scale Image Up. The aspect ratio of the image should not be disturbed when I scale. I should scale Image based on the longer side of Image Area to make sure that whole Image Area comes inside Frame. However when scaling Image down, sometimes this may cause the other side to have blank space inside Frame because of extreme aspect ratios. In such case, I should only scale down until one side hits Image Height or Image Width. This means that the Image Area is not fully shown inside the Frame, but that is fine because the first priority is to not have blank space inside Frame. Now that I have written all these rules, I am unable to wrap my head around formalizing this into a mathematical ""formula""/""procedure""/""rule-set"" that I can then recreate in my software. For scaling, I found that this formula works well (this is a programming pseudo-code): imageX = Image.width()
imageY = Image.height();
imageRatio = imageX / imageY;

frameX = Frame.width();
frameY = Frame.height();
frameRatio = frameX / frameY;

if (imageRatio < wellRatio) 
{
    scale = imageX / wellX;
} 
else 
{
    scale = imageY / wellY;
}
resizeX = (imageX / scale);
resizeY = (imageY / scale); However I do not know how to tie this into the whole picture. Can anyone help me please?

1169466,Is It Always Possible to Draw A Connected Compact Set in $\mathbb R^2$?,"Inspired by this answer , I wondered whether a printer could render all continuous functions ""well enough"". In particular, I am curious about the following statement: Let $S$ be a compact, connected subset of $\mathbb R^2$. For any $\varepsilon>0$ define $$S_{\varepsilon}=\bigcup_{s\in S}B(s,\varepsilon)$$ where $B(s,\varepsilon)$ ithe ball of radius $\varepsilon$ around $s$ (under the usual metric) - that is $S_{\varepsilon}$ is $S$ ""expanded"" everywhere by $\varepsilon$. For all $S$ and $\varepsilon$, must there exist a curve $\gamma:\mathbb [0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb R^2$ of finite length such that $$S_{\varepsilon}=\bigcup_{x\in[0,1]}B(\gamma(x),\varepsilon)$$ Or, putting it informally: Given a compact, connected set, is it possible for a printer, which always draws a swath of radius $\varepsilon$, to render the set as closely as possible? My thinking is ""yes"", because, we can clearly do this if we allow any sloppiness -that is, if we don't care whether the the points within some $0<\varepsilon'$ of the boundary of $S_{\varepsilon}$ are covered. Hopefully, complex figures on the boundary will be swallowed up when we expand out the set $S$ - but I'm suspicious of pathological examples and can't seem to draw up a proof or counterexample. A statement I believe is equivalent (and of which equivalence I believe a simple proof likely exists) is the following: Define $F_{\varepsilon}(S)$ to be the ""inflation"" of $S$ by $\varepsilon$ - the set of points within $\varepsilon$ of some $s\in S$. Define $f_{\varepsilon}(S)$ to be the ""deflation"" of $S$ by $\varepsilon$ - the set of points $s\in S$ such that the ball of radius $\varepsilon$ around is contained in $S$. Then, we wish to show that the boundary of $f_{\varepsilon}(F_{\varepsilon}(S))$ has finite length for any compact $S$.","['metric-spaces', 'continuity', 'real-analysis']"

1169483,What IS the value of a complex line integral?,"The value of a line integral in vector calculus can be seen as ""the sum of how much the of a vector valued function affects every point of the curve"". I know this is not a mathematical definition, but it helps in giving a mental picture of what the value of the integral is. It can also be related to physics, we can for example think of a particle moving in a streaming fluid, then the line integral is the sum of the work done on the particle by the force of the fluid along the line the particle moves. So for example if the fluid has a very strong force along with the movement of the particle, then the value of the line integral will be large, while if it's weak it will be small. It's easy to see the correlation between the math and the physics here. However, when it comes to complex line integrals, I find it hard to even find a definition in words of it that can be related to making a mental picture of it, and even less connected to some physical example. I mean if we calculate a complex line integral, like
$$
\int_C f(z) dz=S
$$
Then what IS the value $S$? In a regular integral it's easy to say for example ""it's the area under the function curve"", and in a real valued line integral it can be said to be the total work done on a particle, for example. But when it's a complex line integral, WHAT IS IT that has actually been calculated? What does the size of the value $S$ mean? If $S$ is a big or small number, what does that signify about the function and the curve that can be visualized geometrically and give a mental picture of it? I want to understand it not just as a mathematical concept, but in a way that connects it to the real world. I know it must be possible since this is being studied in engineering programs (which deal with real world applications) and not just theoretical mathematics.",['integration']
