74630,reference for strongly continuous semi-groups,"At the moment I am trying to understand the proof of the Fredholm property in Salamon's notes on Floer homology. There I came across the notion of an unbounded operator on a (real) Hilbert space which is symmetric and does not have $0$ as an eigenvalue. It is then claimed that the operator generates strongly continuous semigroups on the respective eigenspaces. In fact I would like to understand these notions, but I don't seem to  find good introductory texts. Since the topic seems rather old googling mostly gives me very recent result which are in particular much too specific. Can anyone give me a reference on symmetric unbounded operators on real Hilbert spaces and their corresponding semigroups?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'symplectic-geometry', 'spectral-theory', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
74641,Hartshorne Exercise III.2.1(a),"Show that $H^1(\mathbf{A}^1_k, \mathbf{Z}_U) \neq 0$ for $U = \mathbf{A}^1_k \setminus \{P,Q\}$, $k$ infinite field. Is it really neccessary that $P \neq Q$? My proof is as follows: Take the long exact sequence of $0 \to j_!j*\mathbf{Z} \to \mathbf{Z} \to i^*i_*\mathbf{Z} \to 0$ and get ($H^1(\mathbf{A}^1_k, \mathbf{Z}) = 0$ since $k$ is infinite, so the space is irreducible) $0 \to \mathbf{Z} \to \mathbf{Z} \to \mathbf{Z}^{|X \setminus U|} \to H^1(\mathbf{A}^1_k, \mathbf{Z}_U) \to 0$.  Now tensor with $\mathbf{Q}$ and count the ranks: $1 - 1 + |X \setminus U| - rk H^1(\mathbf{A}^1_k, \mathbf{Z}_U) = 0$, so $H^1(\mathbf{A}^1_k, \mathbf{Z}_U) \neq 0$ for $|X \setminus U| > 0$.

74676,"Axiom of choice, non-measurable sets, countable unions","I have been looking through several mathoverflow posts, especially these ones https://mathoverflow.net/questions/32720/non-borel-sets-without-axiom-of-choice , https://mathoverflow.net/questions/73902/axiom-of-choice-and-non-measurable-set and there still are many questions I would like to ask: 1) According to the first answer of the first post ""It is consistent with ZF without choice that the reals are the countable union of countable sets"" (and therefore all sets are borel, and hence measurable), however this seems in contrast with the answer to the second post which states that ""the existence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set does not imply the axiom of choice"" (and therefore it is possible to construct a ZF model without choice where there exists a non-Lebesgue-measurable set). How can these two statements be both right? 2) I can't understand why the axiom of (countable) choice is necessary to prove that a countable union of countable sets is countable. By saying that the sets are countable, I have already assumed the existence of a bijection from every set to the set of natural numbers, in other words, I have indexed the elements of each set. So what is the problem in chosing elements from each set? This relates to the above topic in that if the AC weren't necessary to prove that countable union of countable sets is countable, then ""It is consistent with ZF without choice that the reals are the countable union of countable sets"" can no longer be correct, since this would imply that in ZF without choice the reals are countable.

74712,Proving rigorously a map preserves orientation,In the following link: http://hilbertthm90.wordpress.com/2009/09/09/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-orientation/ They state that the antipodal map $f: \mathbb{S}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{S}^{n}$ is orientation preserving if n is odd. I'm trying to show this rigorously. Can we argue as follows? We can consider the map $h: \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ given by $h(x)=-x$ then $f$ is the restriction of $h$ to $\mathbb{S}^{n}$. Viewing the restriction as the composition of $h$ with the inclusion map $i$ we get that $D(f)(a)=Dh(i(a)) \circ Di(a)$. But since the inclusion is essentially the identity map then its derivative is the identity map. So $Df(a) = Dh(a)$ so the representation of the derivative of the map $f$ in local coordinates is the same as the jacobian of $h$. Would it suffice then to observe that the determinant of the Jacobian of $h$ is simply $(-1)^{n+1}$ ?,['differential-geometry']

74751,Upper semi-continuity and lower semi-continuity of particular functions,"Let $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded function. Let
$$\bar{f}(x) = \inf_{\delta>0}\sup_{|x-y|<\delta} f(y)$$
$$\underline{f}(x) = \sup_{\delta>0}\inf_{|x-y|<\delta} f(y)$$ (small side question, does anyone know the latex code for a small bar underneath an item?) The problem (well it's got 4 parts, but I'll just put one and hopefully figure things out on the other 3 with a little nudge) Show that $\bar{f}$ is upper semi-continuous on $[a,b]$ The definition of upper semi-continuous we are using is: A function $f$ is upper semi-continuous at $x$ if whenever $f(x)<\alpha$ there is an open set $O$, containing $x$, such that $f(y)<\alpha$ for $y\in O$. I've tried showing this directly and by contradiction, but in both cases I'm simply finding I don't fully understand how to deal with these functions. For example, my direct argument: We must show that when $\bar{f}(x) < \alpha$, there is an open set $O\subset [a,b]$, containing $x$, such that $\bar{f}(z) < \alpha$ for all $z\in O$. But this means we must show if
$$\inf_{\delta>0}\sup_{|x-y| < \delta} f(y) < \alpha,$$
then there is an open set $O\subset[a,b]$ containing $x$ such that
$$\inf_{\delta>0}\sup_{|z-y| < \delta} f(y) < \alpha,$$
for all $z\in O$. Fix some $\delta'>0$. For all $\delta > \delta'$,
$$ \inf \sup \{y:|z-y|<\delta\}f(y) \leq \inf \sup \{y:|z-y|<\delta'\} f(y).$$
so...? Some other thoughts: We note if we have
$$ f(y) > \alpha$$
for all $y\neq x$ on some open neighbourhood of $x$, with $f(x) < \alpha$, then $\bar{f}(x) \geq \alpha$, as $\bar{f}(x)$ does not actually use the value of $f$ at $x$. Hence if $f$ has a removable discontinuity or singularity, $\bar{f}$ will not notice. Hence we may assume our function $f$ does not have a removable singularity. But then $f$ can only have jump discontinuity or an essential discontinuity. If $f$ has a jump discontinuity, perhaps we can find some open neighbourhood $U$ of $f$ containing $x$ such that $f(U)$ is homeomorphic to something connected apart from the jump, and well behaved. If $f$ has an essential discontinuity at $x$, the limit must not exist (as our function is bounded), thought $\bar{f}$ still exists. Again, we could `zoom in' to some connected component (apart from the discontinuity) and things should be nicer there? I'm not sure how to pick such an open neighbourhood of our point though... Even the slightest nudge would be appreciated :) Thanks!","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

74763,How to represent uniformity of a surface?,"My knowledge of math is very basic, my statistics knowledge is even less.  It was suggested to me that I try asking this question here, so here we go: I am developing a software application that will measure and analyze properties of an object's surface.  We want to determine how uniform the surface is and compare it to another object to determine which is ""more uniform"".  Due to confidentiality issues as well as simplicity, I'll use an analogy of a dirt field: Field ""A"" is level, however it has many small pits and little mounds.  All of the bumps and pits are pretty close to the same size, but they are everywhere on the field. Field ""B"" is also level and has much less pits and bumps than field A, however the pits and bumps it DOES have are quite large (and deep). Let's say we have this great machine that can measure the the depth and height of the field in a 6"" grid pattern - so we have this large set of data presenting an evenly spaced grid of points for each field. The first part of my problem was to determine uniformity and after asking around and doing some research it seems that ""variance"" is what I was after.  I am now determining variance by dividing the sum of the squared distances from the mean for each point, something like:
 1. determine the mean
 2. for each point, calculate the square of the distance from the mean
 3. Divide the sum of squared distances by number of points. So { 1, 3, 3, 2, 1 } = 0.8 Honestly I'm not sure I'm doing it correctly, but let's assume I am (for now).  My next question is ""what is 0.8?""  It's my variance... OK, but how would I explain that to a layperson?  Our application is not intended for the scientifically minded person, we basically want to convey the message that ""Field A is smoother than field B"" or ""Field A, while it has more imperfections they are evenly spread out and not as intense as field B"" This is difficult to describe...  I basically need to know what 0.8 ""means""?  Percentages are easy, you can say that ""XYZ is 98% efficient"" (at something) and most people can process that information and understand it.  However I don't know how I can say ""XYZ's surface is 0.8 uniform.""  The person would say ""Well what does that mean?  Is that good?"" That's my first problem: How to express uniformity in simple terms or relative to some other value that makes it easily understandable.  If I plug some more severe numbers into my test program, say { 1,1,1,1,60 } I get a variance of 652.6875 - what!? Please keep in mind, I really don't know what I'm talking about Math wise.  What it boils down to is how to express uniformity of a set of values in a meaningful way to a layperson. I also wasn't sure what tags to use, so if I missed some relevant ones please let me know.

They say this $l$ is the value the sequence converges to, but why...? For example, if the sequence looks like a exponential function, it is monotonic increasing. Just cut off this function somewhere, and it is a bounded monotonic sequence, right? So then the least upper bound $l$ , in this case the maximum value, should be the limit of the sequence? Since the main sequence in the Bolzano-Weierstrass is bounded, it has a monotonic subsequence according to (1), and is bounded as well? Then this subsequence converges.

I can then make $h_{2}(i)=1$ for all $i\in\mathbb N$ , $h_{3}(i)=2$ for all $i\in\mathbb N$ and so on ...

Consider the set $E_i = \{x \in (\alpha, \beta) | m_i < f(x) < m_{i+2}\}$ We have that $(\alpha, \beta)= \bigcup_{i=-\infty}^{\infty}E_i$ and $x_1, x_2 \in E_ i \Rightarrow |f(x_1) - f(x_2)| < m_{i+2} - m_i < \frac{1}{k}$ The oscillation of $f$ on $E_i$ is less than $1/k$. Lebesgue begins by using the fact that $f$ is the limit of continuous functions to prove that each $E_i$ is a countable union of closed sets (this will lead to $f$ being measurable). In fact, he does more than this. He proves that $f$ is a limit of continuous functions if and only if, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the domain can be represented as a countable union of closed sets so that the oscillation of $f$ on each set is strictly less than $1/k$. He next proves that given any set $E$ that is a countable union of closed sets, we can construct a function for which the points of discontinuity are precisely the points of $E$. Let $\phi_i$ be a function on $(\alpha, \beta)$ for which the points of discontinuity are precisely the points in $E_i$. Could all of the functions $\phi_i$, $-\infty < i < \infty$, be pointwise discontinuous? If they were, then there would be a point in $(\alpha, \beta)$, call it $c$, where all of them are continuous. But $f(c) \in E_j$ for some $j$, and that means that $j$ is not continuous at $c$, a contradiction. At least one of the $\phi_i$ must be totally discontinuous. If $\phi_j$ is totally discontinuous on $(\alpha, \beta)$, then there is an open subinterval of $(\alpha, \beta)$ for which $j$ is discontinuous at every point of this subinterval. By the way we defined $j$, the set $E_j$ contains an open subinterval of $(\alpha, \beta)$. From the definition of $E_j$, the oscillation is less than $1/k$ at every point in this subinterval. We have shown that $P_k$ is nowhere dense, and, therefore, $f$ is pointwise discontinuous. In the other direction, if $f$ is not the limit of continuous functions, then there is some $k$ for which the domain cannot be expressed as a countable union of closed sets with oscillation strictly less than $1/k$ on each set. Lebesgue uses this to find an open interval contained in $P_k$. The function $f$ must be totally discontinuous.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

75271,Primitive permutation group with subdegree 4,"What are the possible sizes of a point stabilizer in a primitive permutation group, where the point stabilizer has an orbit of size 4? In the tradition of subdegree 3 and subdegree 2 , I wonder about subdegree 4.  This would be the next exercise in the series 8B.5, 8B.6, 8B.7 on page 249 of Isaacs's Finite Group Theory textbook. I have a rough proof that the point stabilizer has order of the form 2 a 3 b , and (so far at least) all the examples I've looked at have a ≤ 5, b ≤ 2. Is it true that the point stabilizer has order of the form 2 a 3 b ?  If so, is it true that a ≤ 5, b ≤ 2? In general, I think it is true that every prime divisor of the order of the point stabilizer is less than or equal to the size of the suborbit, but I don't have any real feel for how large the prime powers can be.  My proof is silly-easy and doesn't use any graph theory. I haven't yet had a chance to carefully read Sims (1967) [exact a for subdegree 3] , Wong (1967) [exact structure for subdegree 3] , Sims (1968) [exact a for subdegree 4, but assuming b =0?] , Thompson (1970) [general control] , or Cameron et al. (1983) [existence of general bound] , so the answer could be fairly easy. I think CPSS (1983) radically simplifies (maybe even trivializes) for subdegree 4, but Sims (1968) seems like only a partial answer.  It's not clear to me if we know some simple (at least for subdegree 4) combinatorics problem equivalent to this problem. Sims, Charles C.

Then there is an $x_1 \in A$ such that $|x_1-x_0| \leq |x-x_0|, \forall x \in A$. (The norm is Euclidean) Proof: Since $x_0 \notin A$ we have $0<|x-x_0|$. Thus $d=\inf_{x \in A}|x-x_0|$ can be defined. Take a $\delta>0$. Consider the set $S=\{x:|x-x_0| \leq d+\delta\} \cap A$. Clearly $S$ is bounded. It is also closed, being the intersection of two closed sets. Because the function $f(x)=|x-x_0|$ is continuous, it will attain its minimum value over $S$. So there exists an $x_1 \in A$ s.t. $|x_1-x_0| \leq |x-x_0|$  for all $x\in A$ with $|x-x_0| \leq d+\delta$. But this means that $d \leq |x_1-x_0| \leq d + \delta$ for an arbitrary $\delta$.

My logic is consider $A$, the set of all bounded sequences with all terms in $\mathbb{Q}$.  We show that all bounded sequences $(x_n)$ are in the closure of this set.  To show this, we must show that for all $\epsilon$, an $\epsilon$-ball around $(x_n)$ intersects $A$.  But since you can find a rational number arbitrarily close to any number in the reals, you can just find a rational sequence $(a_n)$ such that $|a_n - x_n| < \epsilon$ for all $n$.

75478,"""Trivial"" trigonometry problem","I am really stuck on this problem, and I figured you people could probably help me with it. I have a rectangle with width w and height h with a certain point p inside it. This point is given by the offsets x and y from the topleft of the square. In a picture: Now, I rotate this rectangle by angle a . I draw the surrounding box around it. I want to know the new (x, y) coordinates of point p from the topleft of the surrounding box (or, the lenghts of the purple lines). Notes: this is not homework, this is a programming problem I'm stuck on. In the images the angle a < 90 , this is not necessarily the case. Also, the lengths of the surrounding box are already known, they need not be calculated.","['trigonometry', 'rotations']"
75487,Number of point subsets that can be covered by a disk,"Given $n$ distinct points in the (real) plane, how many distinct non-empty subsets of these points can be covered by some (closed) disk? I conjecture that if no three points are collinear and no four points are concyclic then there are $\frac{n}{6}(n^2+5)$ distinct non-empty subsets that can be covered by a disk. (I have the outline of an argument, but it needs more work. See my answer below.) Is this conjecture correct? Is there a good BOOK proof? This question is rather simpler than the related unit disk question . The answer to this question provides an upper bound to the unit disk question (for $k=1$).","['discrete-geometry', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
75491,How does the existence of a limit imply that a function is uniformly continuous,"I am working on a homework problem from Avner Friedman's Advanced Calculus (#1 page 68) which asks Suppose that $f(x)$ is a continuous function on the interval $[0,\infty)$. Prove that if $\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)$ exists (as a real number), then $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous on this interval. Intuitively, this argument makes sense to me. Since the limit of $f(x)$ exists on $[0,\infty)$, we will be able to find a $\delta > |x_0 - x_1|$ and this implies that, for any $\epsilon>0$, we have $\epsilon > |f(x_0) - f(x_1)|$ (independent of the points chosen). I am aware that the condition of uniform continuity requires that $\delta$ can only be a function of $\epsilon$, not $x$. What information does the existence of a real-valued limit provide that implies $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous on this interval?","['uniform-continuity', 'calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

75510,Motivation behind the definition of tangent vectors,"I've been reading the book Gauge, Fields, Knots and Gravity by Baez. A tangent vector at $p \in M$ is defined as function $V$ from $C^{\infty}(M) $ to $\mathbb R$ satisfying the following properties: $V(f+g)=V(f) + V(g)$. $V(\alpha f)= \alpha V(F)$. $V(fg) = V(f)g(p) + V(g)f(p)$. Can someone explain me what is the physical interpretation of tangent vectors and the above definition?","['motivation', 'differential-geometry']"

75538,How this integral $ \int_0^z\frac{1-e^x}{x} dx$ is connected to the Gamma function and Euler constant?,"This is my first question in this forum; I hope it is an appropriate question.
The Wolframalpha website tells me that
$$
\int\nolimits_0^z\frac{1-e^x}{x} dx = \log (-z)+\Gamma(0, -z)+\gamma\quad \text{for}\quad \Re(z)<0.
$$
I tried to prove this for myself, but I would appreciate it if you could give 
me some help.
This is not a homework question, and I would appreciate it if someone could point me to a reference or tell me what you expect to happen when $ℜ(z)>0$.
Thanks.","['special-functions', 'integration', 'complex-analysis']"
