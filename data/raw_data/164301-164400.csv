2861815,Differences between homeomorphic and topologically conjugate dynamical systems.,"I have begun studying homeomorphisms between dynamical systems. I have a few related questions about homeomorphic and topologically conjugate dynamical systems. Questions How can I determine if a homeomorphism is orientation presevering? If two dynamical systems are Topologically Conjugate (that is $f \circ h=h \circ g$), does this imply that $h$ is an orientation preserving homeomorphism? (Answered see comment below this post) What properties are preserved between two topologically conjugate dynamical systems, compared to two dynamical systems which are only homeomorphic to each other? Definitions $f:X \rightarrow X$, $g:Y \rightarrow Y$ and $h:Y \rightarrow X$ are continuous functions on smooth orientable manifolds, $X$ and $Y$. Topologically Conjugate: $f \circ h=h \circ g$ and $h$ is homeomorphsim. Homeomorphism What it means for a manifold to be orientable . Notes Partial answers are appreciated. If you need any clarification please ask.","['dynamical-systems', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"

2861941,"Find the second degree Taylor polynomial of $f(x,y)=e^{-x^2-y^2}cos(xy)$ at $x_0=0$, $y_0=0$.","I would like to either confirm my solution is correct, or find the error in it. I used the following MATLAB code to try to check my answer, but the solution it gave differs from mine. f = exp(-(x^2+y^2)) cos(x y); taylor(f,[x,y],[0,0]) ans = x^4/2 + (x^2*y^2)/2 - x^2 + y^4/2 - y^2 + 1 My solution: The second degree Taylor polynomial at the point $(a,b)$ is given by
$$p_2(x,y)=f(a,b)+Df(a,b)\left[\begin{array}{c}
x-a\\y-b
\end{array}\right]+\frac{1}{2}[x-a\mbox{ }y-b]Hf(a,b)\left[\begin{array}{c}
x-a\\y-b
\end{array}\right]$$
where $Df(a,b)$ is the Jacobian matrix and $Hf(a,b)$ is the Hessian matrix (i.e. first and second order partial derivatives, respectively). Thus, we begin by computing the partial derivatives:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)=-e^{-x^2-y^2}(y\mbox{ sin}(xy)+2x\mbox{ cos}(xy))\\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)=-e^{-x^2-y^2}(x\mbox{ sin}(xy)+2y\mbox{ cos}(xy))\\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(x,y)=e^{-x^2-y^2}((4x^2-y^2-2)\mbox{cos}(xy)+4xy\mbox{ sin}(xy))\\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}(x,y)=e^{-x^2-y^2}(4xy\mbox{ sin}(xy)-(x^2-4y^2+2)\mbox{cos}(xy))\\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y}(x,y)=\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x}(x,y)=e^{-x^2-y^2}((2x^2+2y^2-1)\mbox{sin}(xy)+3xy\mbox{ cos}(xy))
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Then, at the point $(x_0,y_0)=(0,0)$,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
f(0,0)=1\\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(0,0)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(0,0)=0\\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(0,0)=\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}(0,0)=-2\\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y}(0,0)=\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x}(0,0)=0
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, the second degree Taylor polynomial at the point $(0,0)$ is
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
p_2(x,y)=f(0,0)+Df(0,0)\left[\begin{array}{c}
x-0\\y-0

Does it follows that $T$ itself is an isometry (in fact it is then an isometric isomorphism)? This is true if $E$ is reflexive. Indeed, if $T$ is injective, $T^{*}$ has a dense range. An isometry with a dense range must be an isometric isomorphism, and so $T=T^{**}$ is also an isometric isomorphism. However, if $E$ is not reflexive we cannot conclude that $T^{*}$ has a dense image, only weak* dense, and so I expect that there is a counterexample.","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"

2862028,Why is $\sin(x+y)=c$ not a smooth curve for $c = \pm 1$?,"I understand that, for $c= 1$ and $c=-1$, the derivative of the function $f(x,y)=\sin(x+y)-c$ is a zero vector, and hence the locus which is given by $\sin(x+y)-c=0$ fails to satisfy the definition of the smooth curve. However, I have the following doubt: Suppose $c = 1$. Then, $$ \sin(x+y) = 1  \implies y = -x + \arcsin(1)$$ So, $$y = -x + (4n+1)\pi/2, \quad\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}$$ satisfies the equation. These are a set of parallel lines.
But, why is it failing to satisfy the definition of a smooth curve? I tried to plot the function for $c=1$ in WolframAlpha, but the plot did not contain any points.

2862063,Advice on thinking as an algebraist or topologist to prove theorems in analysis,"Browsing through stackexchange, I'm often struck by the elegance of topological/algebraic proofs for claims in analysis. Time and again, I can come up with one proof but would not have thought of the other, with the ones I think of coming from an analyst's, or sometimes more sacrilegiously, an engineer's perspective. I'm good at juggling around epsilons, establishing inequalities, or proving one of many types of  convergence, but whenever the key step is to invent new spaces as simple as a quotient space, I get stuck. Infuriatingly, I tend to understand the proof once it is presented - I just cannot come up with it on my own. Let me illustrate with an example: The claim to be proven is the following: Let $T: X \rightarrow Y $ be a linear mapping between two normed
  linear spaces. Assume you have proved that if $X$ is finite dimensional,
  $T$ is continuous. Prove that if $Y$ is finite dimensional, $T$ is
  continuous if and only if $\ker(T)$ is closed. If $T$ is continuous, then since $\ker(T) = T^{-1}(0)$ is the preimage of a closed set, it is closed. So far so good. For the second portion I have two different proofs: The first proof is gritty, and in a style of an analysis textbook: Without loss of generality, $T$ is surjective. Let $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a basis for $Y$. Then there exists $\{u_i\}_{i=1}^n$ such that $Tu_i = e_i$. If $T$ were not continuous, there is a sequence $\{x_j\}_{j=1}^\infty \rightarrow 0$ such that $\|Tx_j\|=1$. The unit sphere in $X$ in $Y$ is compact, hence there is a subsequence (for simplicity just $\{x_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$) and a $y \in Y$ with $\|y\| =1$ such that $Tx_j \rightarrow y$. Since $Y$ is finite-dimensional, we have for some appropriate coefficients that 
$$Tx_j = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_{i,j} e_i, \quad y = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i e_i , \text{ where } \alpha_{i,j} \rightarrow \alpha_i \text{ as } j \rightarrow \infty .$$
Denote $w_j = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_{i,j} u_i, w = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i u_i $. Note that $T(w_j - x_j) = 0$, so $w_j - x_j \in \ker(T)$. Since $\ker(T)$ is closed $w = \lim w_j - x_j \in \ker(T)$, but $Tw = y \neq 0$, a contradiction. Hence $T$ must be continuous. The second proof is somewhat topological, and much more clean and elegant: Since $\ker(T)$ is closed, $X/\ker(T)$ is a normed linear space. Define $\bar{T}:X/\ker(T) \rightarrow Y$ by $\bar{T}(x + \ker(T)) = T(x)$, which is linear, and continuous since $X/ker(T)$ is finite-dimensional. Define $\pi: X \rightarrow X/\ker(T)$ in the obvious way. Then note that $T = \bar{T} \circ \pi$ is a composition of continuous function, hence continuous. # This is definitely not a perfect example, but in my imperfect vocabulary, the first, gritty proof is very detailed, full of analysis concepts such as convergence, or simple linear algebra, whereas the second deals with properties of the space as a whole, without relying much on the objects within it. I realize that it is hard to compare these 'styles' in proof, and the first style can go a long way. Nevertheless, I feel that to become a better student of mathematics, and even of analysis, I should get a better handle on algebraic or topological techniques. I've taken courses in abstract algebra and topology, but my intuition for these has not grown sufficiently for me to think of questions in analysis in largely algebraic or topological ways, at least beyond standard linear algebra. In the end, I am sure that I want to study analysis, mostly for applied purposes, and I'm aware that there are practical constraints - I won't be in school forever. Would you still agree that developing greater topological intuition is worthwhile? Why or why not? If you feel that it is worth it, how should I go about cultivating said intuition (keeping in mind that eventually, I will enter applied rather than pure math)?","['real-analysis', 'normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'soft-question', 'general-topology']"

I was asked to evaluate the following expression: $\lim_{n \to \infty} \left({\frac{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)...(3n)}{n{^{2n}}}}\right)^{1/n}$ My first step was to assume that the limit existed, and set that value to $y$. $ y = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left({\frac{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)...(3n)}{n{^{2n}}}}\right)^{1/n}$ And then, I took the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation. I obtained the expression: $ \ln y = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \cdot \left(\ln(1+\frac{1}{n}) + \ln(1+\frac{2}{n}) + ... + \ln(1+\frac{2n}{n})\right) $ This simplified to: $ \ln y = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \cdot \sum_{k = 1}^{\color{Red}{2n}} \ln(1+\frac{k}{n}) $ I realize that this is similar to the form of a Riemann sum, which can then be manipulated to give the expression in the form of a definite integral. However, the part bolded in red, which is $ 2n$, throws me off. I have only seen Riemann sums be evaluated when the upper limit is $ n - k $, where $k$ is a constant. Therefore, how would I go about evaluating this expression? Thank you for all help in advance.","['calculus', 'limits']"

2862257,Sum of digits of sum of digits of sum of digits of $7^{7^{7^7}}$,"On the back of a mathematical magazine, I came across some ""quick facts"" about the number 7. Most of them were real life related ones, like ""Rome was buit on 7 hills"", ""the neck of most mamals is made out of 7 bones"", ""a ladybird has 7 black spots on its back"" etc. But the last one was very intriguing: denote by $A$ the sum of digits of the number $7^{7^{7^7}}$, by $B$ the sum of digits of $A$, and by $C$ the sum of digits of $B$. What is the sum of digits of $C$? After doing some research on the power of usual computers, I concluded that it would not be possible to calculculate this number and find the sums like this. So the solution must be pure mathematical. But I could not manage to find any path to a solution. If it helps, we have that $7^7=823543$ which has sum of digits $25$, but online big number calculators can't even compute $7^{7^7}$, and I figured it was not worth it to write such a program myself. Edit : After some good hours I want to draw some conclusions about the question as well as proposing some extensions. We saw that for the proposed number $^4 7$, the searched sum is $7$. Mees de Vries found a rigorous proof for that, but which doesn't seem to work in a general case; Henry gave a quite tedious solution which may be generalizable with some extra explanations needed, and Gottfried Helms came up with a computer algorithm which he used to deduce that the sum of digits (repeated as many times as necessary) will repeat with period 3 across consecutive powers of 7. Now, based on the fact that from Euler's Theorem we will get that $^n 7$ has residue $7$ mod 9, for any $n\in\mathbb{N}^*$, I came to believe that if we repeatedly do sum of digits for larger $^n 7$ we will also get 7. The question is  how many times we would have to do the sum-of-digits. Also, I would like to notice that the number 7 here is not a simple coincidence. It is because it is $\varphi(9)+1$, and the sum-of-digits conserves mod 9. It would be interesting to find a similar property for 3, which has totient function 2, and also ""conserves"" the residue of the sum-of-digits (here it seems that the sum will be 9 - at least this is how it is for $3^3$ and $3^{3^3}$).

Proof Let $B$ be a countable set and $A$ a nonempty subset of $B$ . First consider the case that $B$ is finite. Let $f$ be a one-to-one correspondence between $\{1,\dots,n\}$ and $B$ . Define $g(1)$ to be the first natural number $j$ , $1\le j\le n$ , for which $f(j)$ belongs to $A$ . If $A=\{f(g(1))\}$ the proof is complete since $f\circ g$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $\{1\}$ and $A$ . Otherwise, define $g(2)$ to be the first natural number $j$ , $1\le j\le n$ , for which $f(j)$ belongs to $A\sim\{f(g(1))\}$ . The pigeonhole principle tells us that this inductive selection process terminates after at most $N$ selections, where $N\le n$ . Therefore $f\circ g$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $\{1,\dots,N\}$ and $A$ . Thus $A$ is finite.

For example, if $p\in (1,\infty )$ we have that $L^p(\mathbb R)$ is reflexive, which mean exactly that $\Phi$ is bijective, right ? So I have a truble with this theorem. Moreover, the proof looks correct : The fact that $\Phi$ is injective is fine. We show the contrapositive, i.e. we suppose $E$ has infinite dimension and we prove that $\Phi$ is not surjective. Fo the surjectivity, let $F=\text{Span}(e_1^*,...,e_n^*)\neq E$. I know that there is a non zero linear form $f:E^*\to K$ s.t. $F\subset \ker(f)$. For all $x=(x_i)_{i\in I}\in E$, $$\Phi(x)(e_{i}^*)=x_i.$$
Therefore, if $\Phi (x)(F)=0$, then $x=0$ and thus $\Phi (x)=0$. Therefore, $f$ is not in the range of $\Phi$ and thus its not surjective. What do you think ?

Then $\lambda^T A = \mathbf{0}^T \Rightarrow \lambda^TA\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\lambda^{T}\mathbf{b}=0$ For the other direction the proof that the notes give proceeds as follows: The implication $\lambda^TA= \mathbf{0}^T \Rightarrow \lambda^T\mathbf{b}=0$ means that both matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ and $(A|\mathbf{b}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times (d+1)}$ have the same linear dependencies among their rows, therefore the same row rank, which means that they have the same column rank. That means that $\mathbf{b}$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$ which implies that $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a solution.

In the very simple case that $Span\{u,v\} = Span\{e_i,e_j\}$ , i.e., the linear space spanned by $u,v$ is the same as the one spanned by $e_i, e_j$ we can compute $R$ as follows: $R = I_n - M$ , in which $M\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is only zeros except for its $i$ -th and $j$ -th rows and columns: $$M_{i, j\times i, j} = \begin{bmatrix}

I wondered about the probability that a stick randomly broken in three places can form a triangle. More generally, we can ask for the probability distribution of the number of triangles that can be formed from the four pieces. Since each triple of the pieces has probability $\frac14$ of forming a triangle, the expected number of triangles we can form is $\frac14\cdot4=1$, which is already a rather nice result. I tried various ways of applying inclusion–exclusion, with or without first ordering the segments by size, but it all seemed too complicated and unenlightening, and I ended up writing a program to output all the inequalities in order to let qhull compute the volumes of the polytopes they define. The result (confirmed by simulations) is: \begin{array}{c|c|c}
&\text{probability}&\text{probability}\\
\#\triangle&\text{(reduced)}&\text{(unreduced)}\\\hline

4&\frac1{15}&\frac7{105}

While the overall distribution is somewhat complicated, the probabilities that we can form all triangles ($\frac1{15}$), any triangle ($\frac47$) and no triangles ($\frac37$) come out as nice low fractions, so I thought that maybe there's hope to find an elegant way to compute (one of) them after all.

2862730,Powers of Irreducible Polynomials in Partial Fractions,"Fractions are normally decomposed by finding the numerator that goes with each individual factor of the denominator of the original fraction.  However, when a denominator factor is repeated, the solution algorithm involves finding numerators for ascending powers of that factor.  So there appears to be a difference in how we treat repeated and non-repeated factors. I thought it might be insightful to work out a couple of examples with almost-repeated factors.  We can find, either trivially or via partial fraction decomposition, that $$\frac{x + 5}{x^2} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{5}{x^2}$$ Compare this to the decomposition of a similar fraction $$\frac{x + 5}{(x + \varepsilon)(x)} = \frac{\varepsilon - 5}{\varepsilon(x + \varepsilon)} + \frac{5}{\varepsilon x}$$ where $\varepsilon$ is an arbitrarily small constant.  To me, it's not particularly clear that the right-hand side (RHS) of each equation relates to that of the other.  We can't set $\varepsilon$ to $0$ in the second RHS, but even using limits to let $\varepsilon$ approach $0$ doesn't yield the first RHS, as I would have guessed.  Furthermore, the solution process does not harmonize the degree disparity between the top and bottom RHS; the top has the form $\frac{degree 0}{degree 1} + \frac{degree 0}{degree 2}$ , while the bottom has the form $\frac{degree 0}{degree 1} + \frac{degree 0}{degree 1}$ . A less trivial example, comparing $$\frac{x^2 + 1}{(x^2)(x + 3)} = -\frac{1}{9x} + \frac{1}{3x^2} + \frac{10}{9(x + 3)}$$ to $$\frac{x^2 + 1}{(x + \varepsilon)(x)(x + 3)} = \frac{1}{3\varepsilon x} + \frac{\varepsilon^2 + 1}{\varepsilon(\varepsilon - 3)(x + \varepsilon)} + \frac{10}{3(3 - \varepsilon)(x + 3)}$$ reveals a similar absence of clarity.  Confusingly, one gets the urge to let some of the $\varepsilon$ approach $0$ while letting others approach $3$ , but even arbitrarily allowing this much freedom won't allow us to reach the top RHS in this pair. Why is this analysis not providing more insight into the repeated factor rule for partial fraction decomposition, and will some other analysis in a similar vein work better?","['intuition', 'partial-fractions', 'limits', 'calculus', 'fractions']"

Best known examples are the logarithmic spiral and the Archimedean spiral . Problem : Find a spiral whose centroid is the origin of the coordinate system. Progress so far : We want $$\int_\gamma x\,ds = \int_\gamma y \,ds = 0 \tag1$$
Note that $x = f(\theta)\cos\theta$, $y = f(\theta)\sin\theta$, and $ds = \sqrt{(f'(\theta))^2 + f(\theta)^2}\,d\theta$. Thus, we need the function 
$$g(\theta) = f(\theta) \sqrt{(f'(\theta))^2 + f(\theta)^2} $$ 
to be orthogonal to both $\cos \theta$ and $\sin\theta$ on the interval $[a, b]$, meaning $$\int_a^b g(\theta)\cos\theta\,d\theta = \int_a^b g(\theta)\sin\theta\,d\theta  = 0\tag2$$ A natural way to satisfy (2) is to take $[a, b] = [0, 2\pi]$ and $g$ to be constant (say $g\equiv 1$ as scaling does not matter). However this fails, because solving the equation $g\equiv 1$ for $f$ (as an autonomous ODE) yields $f(\theta) = \sqrt{\sin 2\theta}$ (up to a shift), which is not even defined, let alone monotone, on any interval of length $2\pi$.

Then $\sum a_n$ converges iff $\sum \frac{a_n}{1+a_n}$ converges. My attempt : $\Rightarrow$ $$\frac{a_n}{1+a_n} \leq a_n$$ and this follows from comparison test. $\Leftarrow$ Since $$a_n = \frac{a_n}{1+a_n} (1+a_n) = \frac{a_n}{1+a_n} + \frac{a_n^2}{1+a_n}$$ it suffices to show that $\sum \frac{a_n^2}{1+a_n}$ converges. For this, it suffices to show that $(a_n)$ is bounded, because then the result follows from the comparison test. Indeed, let $M$ be an upperbound. Then $$\frac{a_n^2}{1+a_n} \leq \frac{Ma_n}{1+a_n}$$ We will prove that $a_n \to 0$, and this will prove the boundedness. Let $\epsilon > 0$. Choose $N$ such that $\frac{a_n}{1+a_n} < \frac{\epsilon}{1+ \epsilon}$ for $n \geq N$, which is possible since $\frac{a_n}{1+a_n} \to 0$ since the series converges.

$$ This probability is claimed to converge to 1 , when $n \rightarrow +\infty$. Empirically simulating this function, indeed it converges to 1, for different values of $p$. Additionally, I conjecture that this function is an strictly increasing with $n$ (for $n > 2$ and $p > 0.5$). Any thoughts on how we can prove/disprove this conjecture? Here is an effort: If I prove that $f(n) - f(n-1) > 0$ for any $n > 2$, I'm done (proving that it's strictly increasing).

$$ Since $p > 0.5$, $1-p < 0.5$ and $\frac{n-1}{n-i} (1-p)^{i} < 1$ (for any $i$). Hence the first term is positive. However, this is not enough for proving the strict increasing behavior of $f(n)$; we have to show that this is first term is strictly biggeer than the 2nd (negative) term.

$$f(z)=\frac{\ln^2 z}{(1+z^2)^2}=\frac{\ln^2 z}{(z+i)^2(z-i)^2}\,.$$
The integral over $C_R$ and $C_\epsilon$ vanish as $R$ approaches $\infty$ and $\epsilon$ approaches $0$. So we only need to evaluate the residues
$$\oint\limits_C f(z)dz = 2\pi i \sum \text{Res}\big(f(z)\big)\,.$$ The poles are $\pm i$ and of second order. Here is our chosen contour . Let us recall the residue of an $m$-th order of pole is
$$\text{Res}[f(z);z_0]=\frac{1}{(m-1)!}\lim_{z\to z_0} \frac{\text{d}^{m-1}}{\text{d}z^{m-1}}\,(z-z_0)^m\,f(z)\,.$$ Consequently the residues are
$$\text{Res}[f(z);i]=\lim_{z \to i}\Bigg(\frac{2\ln z}{z(z+i)^2}-\frac{2\ln^2 z}{(z+i)^3}\Bigg)=\frac{2\cdot \left(\frac{i\pi}{2}\right)}{-4i}-\frac{2\cdot (-\frac{\pi^2}{4})}{-8i}=-\frac{\pi}{4}+i\frac{\pi^2}{16}$$
As for the other pole
$$\text{Res}[f(z);-i]=\lim_{z \to -i}\Bigg(\frac{2\ln z}{z(z-i)^2}-\frac{2\ln^2 z}{(z-i)^3}\Bigg)=\frac{2\cdot \left(\frac{i3\pi}{2}\right)}{4i}-\frac{2\cdot \left(-\frac{9\pi^2}{4}\right)}{8i}=\frac{3\pi}{4}-i\frac{9\pi^2}{16}\,.$$ Adding these two together and remembering the residue theorem, we have
$$\oint\limits_C f(z)\,\text{d}z = 2\pi i \cdot \left(\frac{\pi}{2}-i\frac{\pi^2}{2}\right)=i\pi^2+\pi^3$$
On the other hand, for the integrals over $C_+$ and $C_-$, $z=x$ and $z=xe^{2\pi i}$ respectively. Hence, we can write
$$\int\limits_\epsilon^R\frac{\ln^2 x}{(1+x^2)^2} \,\text{d}x + \int\limits_R^\epsilon \frac{(\ln x +2\pi i)^2}{(1+x^2)^2} \,\text{d}x=i\pi^2+\pi^3\,.$$
If we let $R \to \infty$ and $\epsilon \to 0$ and change the direction of the second integral, we get
$$-4\pi i\int\limits_0^\infty\frac{\ln x}{(1+x^2)^2}\,\text{d}x + 4\pi^2\int\limits_0^\infty\frac{\text{d}x}{(1+x^2)^2}=i\pi^2+\pi^3\,.$$ Comparing the real and the imaginary parts
$$\int\limits_0^\infty\frac{\ln x}{(1+x^2)^2}\,\text{d}x = -\frac{\pi}{4}$$

By assumption, $\psi$ is surjection so we find some $a\in X$ such that $\psi(a)=A$. Then we have two cases, either $a\in A$, but the, by definition of $A$: $a\notin \psi(a)$ which is a contradiction. So $a\notin A$ but then $a\in \psi(a)=A$ which is a contradiction aswell thus such surjection cannot exist. So now, for my question. The definition of $A$ seems really weird to me. Because, in the first place. Assume $X=\{1,2\}$ then $\mathcal{P}(X)=\{\{1,2\},\{1\},\{2\},\emptyset\}$. In the proof $A$ is supposed to be the set of all members of $X$ (thus numbers) that are not in the range of $\psi$ but, the range of $\psi$ are sets, aren't they? Thus $A=\{1,2\}$ and the case is $\forall a\in X:a\in{A}$ thus the second case of the proof applies. Basically this leads me to the following idea: instead of constructing this set $A$, we can say that: Estabilish injection and thus $|X|\leq|\mathcal{P}(X)|$ by $\varphi:x\mapsto\{x\}$ thus $\forall{S}\in\varphi(x):|S|=1$, but for any set $X:$ $\emptyset\subset\mathcal{P}(X)$ but $|\emptyset|=0$ so $\emptyset\notin ran(\varphi)$ thus $\varphi$ is not surjective.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-explanation']"

From my understanding, this is a secant line, since it intersects the function two times, whereas a tangent only intersects once at a certain point. Since this is the derivative, how does it give me a secant line? It may be false that the tangent line can only intersect at one point, but that still does not make sense to me. If that is true, how would you know the difference between a tangent line and the secant line? In my case here, how would I find the tangent line? it seems to me that functions with a degree greater than two will have this complication as well. $$f(x) = x^n, n > 2$$ So, if someone would help me understand that relationship between these three concepts and why the tangent line may, in most cases, intersect the function more than once it would help me very much.

Suppose $M\subseteq \Bbb R^n$ is an embedded $m$-dimensional submanifold. For each $x\in M$, we define the normal space to $\pmb M$ at $\pmb x$ to be the $(n-m)$-dimensional subspace $N_xM\subseteq T_x\Bbb R^n$ consisting of all vectors that are orthogonal to $T_xM$ with respect to the Euclidean dot product. The normal bundle of $\pmb{M}$ , denoted by $NM$, is the subset of $T\Bbb R^n\approx \Bbb R^n\times\Bbb R^n$ consisting of vectors that are normal to $M$:
$$
NM = \big\{(x,v) \in \Bbb R^n\times\Bbb R^n : x\in M,\ v\in N_xM \big\}.
$$ The statement and part of the proof of Theorem 6.23 in Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds is reproduced below: Theorem 6.23. If $M\subseteq \Bbb R^n$ is an embedded $m$-dimensional submanifold, then $NM$ is an embedded $n$-dimensional submanifold of $T\Bbb R^n\approx \Bbb R^n\times\Bbb R^n$. Proof. Let $x_0$ be any point of $M$, and let $(U,\varphi)$ be a slice chart for $M$ in $\Bbb R^n$ centered at $x_0$. Write $\widehat U = \varphi(U)\subseteq \Bbb R^n$, and write the coordinate functions of $\varphi$ as $\big(u^1,\dots,u^n\big)$, so that $M\cap U$ is the set where $u^{m+1}=\dotsb=u^n=0$. At each point $x\in U$, the vectors $E_j|_x = (d\varphi_x)^{-1}\big(\partial/\partial u^j|_{\varphi(x)}\big)$ form a basis for $T_x\Bbb R^n$. We can expand each $E_j|_x$ in terms of the standard frame [emphasis added] as
  $$
E_j\big|_x = E_j^i(x)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\bigg|_x,
$$
  where each $E_j^i(x)$ is a partial derivative of $\varphi^{-1}$ evaluated at $\varphi(x)$, and thus is a smooth function of $x$. The proof goes on, but my question is about this part of the proof. Is $\partial/\partial u^j|_{\varphi(x)}$ literally the partial derivative operator in the $e_j = (0,\dots,0,\underbrace{1}_{\text{$j$th component}},0,\dots,0)$ direction? If not, what is it precisely, using Lee's notation? I suspect that if $\partial/\partial u^j|_{\varphi(x)}$ is not literally the partial derivative operator in the $e_j$ direction, then
$\partial/\partial x^j|_x = (d\varphi_x)^{-1}\big(\partial / \partial x^j|_{\varphi(x)}\big)$, where $\partial / \partial x^j|_{\varphi(x)}$ is
literally the partial derivative operator in the $e_j$ direction, and that $\partial/\partial u^j|_{\varphi(x)}$ must be something else. What is $E^i_j(x)$ explicitly?

Let $a<b$ being two real numbers. Define $\tau = \inf\{t:X_t\notin [a,b]\}$ and I want to find $E[X_\tau\mid X_0=x]$. I know one method using Feynman-Kac theorem. Denote $u(t,X_t) = E[X_\tau\mid X_t]$ exploiting its markovian property. Then $u$ is a martingale by Tower property. By Ito's lemma:

Since $u(x)$ should have a form like
$$
u(x)=aP(X_\tau=a) + bP(X_\tau=b)

Is it safe to guess $P(X_\tau=a \mid X_t=x)=\frac{\int_x^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}{\int_a^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}$ and $P(X_\tau=b \mid X_t=x)=\frac{\int_a^x e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}{\int_a^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}$? My reason is that it seems very reasonable if $x$ increases from $a$ to $b$, $X_\tau$ varies from $a$ and more and more likely becomes $b$ when $x$ increases. Besides, $\frac{\int_a^x e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}{\int_a^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx} + \frac{\int_x^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}{\int_a^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}=1$. I generally have three questions: How to justify $P(X_\tau = a) + P(X_\tau = b) = 1$, namely $P(\tau = \infty) = 0$? How to justify $P(X_\tau = a)$ and $P(X_\tau = b)$ happen to be the coefficient of $a$ and $b$ in the expression of $u(x)$? I also learned a technique to compute this type of problem by constructing martingales like $B_t^2-t$ when we compute the exit time of Brownian motion. Is there similar way to solve this problem? I notice $e^{-t}X_t$ is a martingale but don't know how to proceed. Thank you for any help!","['stochastic-processes', 'expectation', 'probability', 'martingales']"

2863907,characteristic classes arising from connections are well-defined,"I am reading an excerpt from Morita's book. The story is that if you have a connection $\nabla$ on a vector bundle $E$ over some manifold $M$ and a function $M_n(\mathbb{R})\to \mathbb{R}$ which is a homogeneous polynomial invariant under conjugation, then you obtain a form on $M$ by applying $f$ to the curvature matrix $\Omega$. What needs to be shown is that $f(\Omega)$ is a closed form, and that $[f(\Omega)]$ doesn't depend on the connection you started with. The second part is what I'm having trouble with. What Morita does is suppose we are given connections $\nabla^0$ and $\nabla^1$ on $E$. Consider the bundle $E\times\mathbb{R}\to M\times\mathbb{R}$ and define a connection $\tilde{\nabla}$ on $E\times \mathbb{R}$ in the following way. Suppose $s$ is a section of $E\times\mathbb{R}$ which is independent of $t$ (that is, $s(p,t) = s(p,t')$ for all $t, t'$). Then define $\tilde{\nabla}_{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}} s = 0$ and 
$$
\tilde{\nabla}_X s = (1-t)\nabla_X^0 s + t\nabla_X^1 s 
$$
for $X\in T_{(p,t)}(M\times\mathbb{R})$. I understand that every vector field on $M\times \mathbb{R}$ can be written as a linear combination with function coefficients of $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ and vector fields which are tangent to $M\times \{t\}$. Morita says that also every section of $E\times \mathbb{R}$ can be written as a linear combination with function coefficients of sections which are independent of $t$. I don't see why this is true. Moreover, aren't you supposed to be feeding connections vector fields and not tangent vectors? Is the point here that a vector field on $M\times\mathbb{R}$ which is tangent to $M\times \{t\}$ can be considered as a vector field on $M$?","['characteristic-classes', 'connections', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"
2863921,Cellular Automata on the Collatz Conjecture,"I have a Cellular Automaton that of any initial integer (initial condition of the automaton) generates states of Collatz sequences. The neighbourhood of the automaton is shaped like an L-tetromino (including two time-states). The (quiescent) background is represented as $0$ (the state zero). The other $1$-state (on-state) generates active border on the left side during the generation of the automaton. The border is the interesting part because that is where the ""currect"" generation either increases (is odd), are still (is odd) or decreases (is even). My earlier post on the matter was closed due to my question being unclear. I have found out that if I can write a paper about this (or get somebody to help me writing it - helping me with terminology and such), we could represent the ($3n+1$) Collatz-problem with an Cellular Automaton (or Adaptive Cellular Automaton), and someone could approach the problem from that standpoint; like for example, Matthew Cook proved that Rule 110 was Turing Complete (i.e universal); and an undergraduate from UK proved that a $2,3$ Turing machine was universal. I have a feeling that we might perhaps find out if the conjecture is true, false or unprovable by solving some properties of this automaton. Since now the Collatz Conjecture is represented as a Cellular Automaton, I think we can make one or more conjectures; one that either indirectly proves or disproves the conjecture, or one that gives us some information about its behaviour or if its undecidable. I have not been able to reach out to the mathematics community with my Cellular Automaton on the Collatz conjecture, and I don't know if it allready exists (that is; if someone else have allready done it), I have not yet found a paper that looks similiar to my representation (on an binary integer lattice using L-tetromino shaped neighbourhood). On the automaton: I think convergence is difficult to prove in a Cellular Automaton, but it might be possible depending on the neighbourhood, rule and CA-setup perhaps. I think maybe proving that the paths that the neighbourhood takes (Transition Function) reaches some boundary (or not) will prove that the Conjecture is true or not. It's hard for me to actually describe what I mean about this. Please, if anyone have tried this before? I would like to hear more about it. Anyone how knows about information, or a paper on this specifically I would like to know. My question is; does there allready exists a conjecture on the Collatz in the form of an Cellular Automaton, and such that if something about it can be proven true or false - it will also prove if the original Conjecture is true or false?

$$
\mid 1+z\mid^2+\mid 1-z\mid^2

for (arbitrary) complex $z$ lying on the unit circle. This evaluates to $4$. Consider the triangle $0,1+z,1-z$ and shift it to the left by $1$. We get a triangle inscribed in a circle with one of its sides lying on a diagonal. Conversely, if we start with any triangle inscribed in a circle lying on a diagonal we can embed the figure in $\mathbb{C}$, so that the image of the circle is the unit circle, and the vertices of the triangle are $-1,z,-z$ for some $z\in\mathbb{C}$. Now, shift the triangle to the right by 1. Two of its sides become $1+z$ and $1-z$. Our computation shows that this triangle is a right triangle. This result is known as the Thales's theorem. Question 1. Is this a well-known proof of the Thales's theorem? Question 2. Did the author actually mean this to be ""discovered""? If yes, then should one expect to find a lot of such ""purposefully hidden"" stuff in Rudin's books?","['real-analysis', 'complex-numbers', 'soft-question', 'geometry']"

2863971,"Closed or Open Intervals in Extreme Value Theorem, Rolle's Theorem, and Mean Value Theorem","I am a little confused by the openness of intervals in Extreme Value Theorem (EVT), Rolle's Theorem (RT), and Mean Value Theorem (MVT): EVT: Given a function $f:[a,b]\rightarrow R$ is continuous, $f$ attains its maximum and minimum at some $c\in [a,b]$. ( closed intervals ) RT: Given $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, if $f(a)=f(b)$, then there exists $c\in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=0$. ( I believe if $f$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$, then, there exists $c\in [a,b]$ such that $f'(c)=0$. Why do we need an open interval in this statement? ) MVT:  Given $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, then there exists $c\in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$. ( Obviously, MVT goes with RT. Again, I believe we can just replace ""differentiable on $(a,b)$ by ""differentiable on $[a,b]$"", and then get ""there exists $c\in [a,b]$ such that $\dots$."" Do we use an open interval for some specific reason? ) Thanks in advance for any explanation.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'continuity']"
