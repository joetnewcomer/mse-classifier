371151,Let G be a group and let $a\in G$. Define $F_a:G\mapsto G$ via $F_a(x)=axa^{-1}$ for all $a\in G$. Prove that $F_a$ is an isomorphism from G onto G,"This is what I have for my proof: $F_{a^{-1}}(F_{a}(x))=F_{a^{-1}}(axa^{-1})=a^{-1}axa^{-1}a=(a^{-1}a)x(a^{-1})(a)=1x1=x$ $F_{a}(F_{a^{-1}}(x))=F_{a}(a^{-1}xa)=aa^{-1}xaa^{-1}=(aa^{-1})x(aa^{-1})=1x1=x$ $\Rightarrow F_{a}$ has a two sided inverse $\Rightarrow F_a$ is invertible $\Rightarrow F_a$ is one-to-one and onto G So I need to establish that $F_a$ preserves that group operations to show its an isomorphism and since $F_a$ is a map between two groups we only need to show that it preserves that group product Let $x,y\in G$ $F_a(xy)=axya^{-1}=ax1ya^{-1}=ax(a^{-1}a)ya^{-1}=(axa^{-1})(aya^{-1})=F_a(x)F_a(y)$ $\Rightarrow F_a$ preserves the group product $\therefore F_a$ is an isomorphism from G onto G Do I need to add anything else or is that exactly what I need?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'solution-verification']"

371184,Predicting Real Numbers,"Here is an astounding riddle that at first seems impossible to solve.  I'm certain the axiom of choice is required in any solution, and I have an outline of one possible solution, but would like to see how others might think about it. $100$ rooms each contain countably many boxes labeled with the natural numbers.  Inside of each box is a real number.  For any natural number $n$ , all $100$ boxes labeled $n$ (one in each room) contain the same real number.  In other words, the $100$ rooms are identical with respect to the boxes and real numbers. Knowing the rooms are identical, $100$ mathematicians play a game.  After a time for discussing strategy, the mathematicians will simultaneously be sent to different rooms, not to communicate with one another again.  While in the rooms, each mathematician may open up boxes (perhaps countably many) to see the real numbers contained within.  Then each mathematician must guess the real number that is contained in a particular unopened box of his choosing.  Notice this requires that each leaves at least one box unopened. $99$ out of $100$ mathematicians must correctly guess their real number for them to (collectively) win the game. What is a winning strategy?","['puzzle', 'axiom-of-choice', 'sequences-and-series', 'recreational-mathematics']"

371223,elementary ring proof with composition of functions and addition of functions as operations,"Consider the set $\mathcal{F}=\lbrace f\mid \mathcal{f}:\Bbb{R}\to\Bbb{R}\rbrace$, in which an additive group is defined by addition of functions and a second operation defined as composition of functions. The question asks to verify that the resulting structure does not satisfy the ring properties. This is the question 24.10 from Modern Algebra , by Durbin, 4th edition. So what I have so far is that all of the properties for the additive group (with addition of functions as the operation here) hold, associativity of the composition of functions hold, and that the failure must come from the distributive laws. My proof of my claim, so far; 
$$1\,\,\,\,\,[(\mathcal{f}\circ\mathcal{g})+\mathcal{h}](\mathcal{x})=\cdots=\mathcal{f}(\mathcal{g}(\mathcal{x}))+\mathcal{f}(\mathcal{h}(\mathcal{x})).$$
...but, 
$$2\,\,[(\mathcal{f}\circ\mathcal{g})+\mathcal{h}](\mathcal{x})=$$
$$3\,\,(\mathcal{f}\circ\mathcal{g})(\mathcal{x})+\mathcal{h}(\mathcal{x})=$$
$$4\,\,\,\mathcal{f}(\mathcal{g}(\mathcal{x}))+\mathcal{h}(\mathcal{x}).$$
...which brings me to my contradiction of the properties of rings that; 
$$5\,\,\,[\mathcal{f}\circ(\mathcal{g}+\mathcal{h})](\mathcal{x})\neq[(\mathcal{f}\circ\mathcal{g})+\mathcal{h}](\mathcal{x}).$$ So my question is, is this the correct path to showing the distributive laws are not obeyed when composition is taken as an operation on $\mathcal{F}$? particularly my proceeding from 2 to 3 to 4 is what i feel uncomfortable about, like i may be missing a step in there. thanks","['proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra']"

371244,Outer measure defined with rectangles,"I'm studying Measure Theory by myself and I would appreciate some guidance about my proof. My textbook constructs an outer measure as following: $$m_*(E)=\inf\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|Q_k|$$ where the infimum is taken over all coverings of $E
$ with closed cubes . In an exercise it asks to prove that the above definion, only with rectangles instead of cubes, will give rise to the same measure, i.e. I need to prove that: $$m_*(E)=\inf\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|Q_k|=\inf\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|R_k|=m_*^R(E)$$ where on the left the infimum is taken over covering with cubes, and on the right is taken over covering with rectangles. The fact that $m_*(E)\geq m_*^R(E)$ is obious. STEP 1 : When the infimum is taken only over ""rational"" rectangles, i.e. rectangles in which the ratio between all edges is rational, then each of these rectangles can be devided into a finitely many cubes and it follows that the infimum must be equal . STEP 2 : This is the step that I'm not sure about. What is left to prove that coverings with rational rectangles give rise to the same measure as covering with general rectangles. Let $\{R_j\}$ be a covering of $E$ with rectangles and let $\{R_j^*\}$ be the subseries of not rational rectangles in $\{R_j\}$. Then each $R_j^*$ can be extended to a rational rectangle $R_j^{**}$ so that  $|R_j^{**}|=|R_j^{*}|+\epsilon/2^j$. We remain with a covering of $E$ and thus: $$\inf \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|R_j|=\inf\left(\sum_{rational\ rect.}|R_j|+\sum_{irrational\ rect.}|R_j^{*}|\right) = \inf\left(\sum_{rational\ rect.}|R_j|-\sum_{j=1^\ }^\infty\frac{\epsilon}{2^j}\right)$$
$$=\inf\left(\sum_{rational\ rect.}|R_j|\right)-\epsilon$$ And since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary the claim is proven. Is it correct? Thanks!",['measure-theory']
371247,Statistical Freedom,"What is the English counterpart of the French term ""statistique libre""? The following excerpt, translated by me from an excellent 70's French textbook in mathematical statistics ([BAR]), defines the term ""a free statistic"" (""statistique libre""). As i am unfamiliar with either the term or its definition, and as i did not find a definition thereof in the French Wikipedia, i was wondering whether this concept has a standard English name, or whether it has not withstood the test of time and its use is essentially confined to this textbook. Let $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathbf{P}\right)$ be a statistical space. An event $A$ is said to be free if $P(A)$ is the same value for all $P\in\mathbf{P}$ . A sub- $\sigma$ -algebra $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{A}$ is said to be free if each of its events is. The statistic $T$ , taking values in $\left(\Gamma,\mathcal{B}\right)$ is said to be free if $T^{-1}\left(\mathcal{B}\right)$ is, i.e. if $T$ 's distribution is the same for all $P\in\mathbf{P}$ . -- Ch. II, Sec. 4, Definition 1 I should add that, as far as the author of the textbook is concerned, this is a very important concept: It features in the title of a chapter right next to ""sufficiency"" (chapter II: ""Sufficiency and Freedom""), and the author goes on to write that the two notions of sufficiency and freedom are distinctive features of statistics that separate it from probability.

Prove that $\cup _{n=1}^\infty B_n$ is not necessarily a closed set. What I thought : Using a counterexample: If I say that each $B_i$ is a set of all numbers in range $[i,i+1]$ then I can pick a sequence $a_n \in \cup _{n=1}^\infty B_n$ s.t. $a_n \to \infty$ (because eventually the set includes all positive reals) and since $\infty \notin \Bbb R$ then $\cup _{n=1}^\infty B_n$ is not a closed set.

371318,What is the number of ways to divide a rectangle into $n$ smaller rectangles line by line? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Number of ways to partition a rectangle into n sub-rectangles (4 answers) Closed 4 years ago . The original problem was to consider how many ways to make a wiring diagram out of $n$ resistors. When I thought about this I realized that if you can only connect in series and shunt. - Then this is the same as dividing an area with $n-1$ horizontal and vertical lines. When each line only divides one of the current area sections into two smaller ones. This is also the same as the number of ways to make a set of $n$ (and only $n$) rectangles into a bigger rectangle. If the rectangles can be drawn by dividing the big rectangle, line by line, into the set of rectangles without lose endpoints of the line. - Can someone come to think of ""a expression of $n$"" which equals this amount, independent of the order of the rectangles or position? (It is only the relations between the area sections that matters and not left or right, up or down. However dividing an area with a horizontal line is not the same as dividing it with a vertical line.)",['combinatorics']

I've been looking for any tutorial or some explanations about the topic but I haven't found anything useful and - what's more important - well explained. 1) Do ALL ordinary generating functions look like the polynomial 1 + a1x + a2x^2 + a3x^3 + ..., where (a)n depend on the given sequence? So for example the generating function for the (1, 0, 1, 0, ...) sequence would be 1 + a1x + a3x^3 + a5x^5 + ... ? 2) What actually is the generating function?

371467,Convergence of random variables (Durrett: Probability Theory and Examples),"I was working out some problems from Rick Durrett's Probability theory and Examples (2010 edition), when I came across a very unusual question(reproduced here ad-verbatim): If $X_n$ is ANY sequence of random variables, there are constants $c_n \to \infty$ so that
$$\frac{X_n}{c_n} \to 0 \quad \mbox{a.s}$$ You will find it in Chapter 2: Laws of Large Numbers, under the section on Borel Cantelli Lemma. What makes this question unusual is that there are NO assumptions made on the random variables. My attempt: I rephrased the question equivalently as: If $X_n$ is ANY sequence of random variables, there are constants $a_n \to 0$ so that we need to show
$$a_nX_n \to 0 \quad \mbox{a.s}$$ Then I showed that it was sufficient to assume $a_n > 0$ and $X_n \geq 0$. To see this, since the limit is going to , the sign of the constants do not matter, hence positivity of $a_n$ can be assumed w.l.o.g. As for an arbitrary r.v, any r.v can be written as: $$X_n = X_n^+ - X_n^-$$ where $X_n^+ = \max(X_n,0)$ and $X_n^- = \max(-X_n,0)$ Suppose we prove the result for non-negative random variables, then say we have 
$$b_n X_n^+ \to 0 \quad c_n X_n^- \to 0 \quad \mbox{a.s}$$ Then pick $a_n = \min(b_n,c_n)$. Then this will ensure 
$$a_nX_n \to 0 \quad \mbox{a.s}$$ For the non-negative case, I was able to prove the result for simple functions: If $X_n$ is simple, and $X_n = \sum_{k=1}^n s_k 1_{A_k}$, take $a_n = \frac{1}{2^{n} \sum_{k=1}^n s_k}$ would work, but only if all functions were simple. Now the tough part. Handling the non -ve measurable function case. I had difficulty here. Hence my question is: I'd like a hint/answer (preferably a hint) on how to solve this particular case. Right now I am looking at manipulating the lemma that every non-negative measurable function can be approximated by a monotone sequence of simple functions. Thank you.

371487,Dihedral group as a matrix group,"I wish to consider the dihedral group as a matrix group.

I also understand that as you go down the line of slots, there are less and less objects available to select for a particular slot that is relatively far from the first slot.

371521,Broken Calculator: only certain unary functions work.,"I have run into a challenge on Codecademy.com that has me absolutely bewildered. I'm sure I'm just overlooking an obvious solution, but I've been scouring tables of trigonometric and logarithmic identities for days and I still don't know where to start. The original task is here , and it's simply called ""Broken Calculator"". I've found other ""Broken Calculator"" problems online, but this one is the first I've seen that makes use of trig and log functions.  Specifically, the only functions available are $e^x$, $ln$, $x^2$, √, $sin$, $cos$, $arcsin$, and $arccos$. The calculator defaults to 0, so you can get the number 1 by hitting $e^x$, and you can get 2 by hitting $e^x$ again, then $x^2  $, then $ln$. That's all simple. Now, I can get any power of 2 by repeating the steps above, and similarly, given any number to start from, I can multiply or divide by a power of 2. That's easy. The next challenge is to get 3, which I found using a 1, 2, √3 triangle and the appropriate trig functions: $e^x$, $e^x$, √, $ln$, $arcsin$, $cos$, $e^x$, $x^2$, $ln$, $x^2$ -> 3 Again, I'm sure you find this trivial, but how would I use the same functions to get the number 11, or really any odd number for that matter other than 3? Edit The first two comments point out that the factorial operator is available for the first task where we need to find 3. However, in the very next task , we lose the factorial operator in exchange for the trig functions.

371523,Binary tetrahedral group and $\rm{SL}_2(\mathbb F_3)$,"The binary tetrahedral group $\mathbb T$ is an interesting 24-element group. For instance it can be expressed as the subgroup
$$ \mathbb T = \left\{ \pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k, \dfrac{\pm 1 \pm i \pm j \pm k}2 \right\} \subseteq \mathbb{H}^\times$$
of the multiplicative group of the quaternions (which also gives you a fascinating regular 24-vertex 4-polyhedron). Alternatively, the binary tetrahedral group can be thought of as the inverse image of $\mathfrak A(4)$ through the 2:1 morphism $\rm{SU}_2 \to \rm{SO}_3$ ($\mathfrak A(4) \subseteq \rm{SO}_3$ being the group of direct isometries of the regular tetrahedron). The property which puzzles me is the following: $\mathbb T$ is isomorphic to the matrix group $\rm{SL}_2(\mathbb F_3)$ . I'm able to give a proof of this result, but not an enlightening one. Essentially, a 24-element group with a normal subgroup isomorphic to the 8-element quaternion group $\rm Q_8$ is either isomorphic to $\rm Q_8 \times \rm C_3$ or to the unique nontrivial semidirect product $\rm Q_8 \rtimes \rm C_3$; it's not that hard to prove that both $\mathbb T$ and $\rm{SL}_2(\mathbb F_3)$ satisfy this property and belong to the second case. The only interesting thing about this proof is the description of that normal $\rm Q_8$: on the one hand $\{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\} \subset \mathbb T$ is the inverse image of the quite exceptional Vierergruppe $V_4 = \{ \rm{id}, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\} \lhd \mathfrak A(4)\subseteq \rm{SO}_3$; on the other hand, the elements of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb F_3)$ which are diagonalisable over $\mathbb F_9$ — or, equivalently, $\pm I_2$ and the matrices whose trace is zero — form a normal subgroup isomorphic to $\rm Q_8$ (and it's quite astonishing they do form a subgroup!) whose elements are
$$\begin{array}{l} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix},\\ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\ -1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}. \end{array}$$ As I said earlier, this proof isn't very satisfying.

371528,Positive curvature on holomorphic vector bundles,"There must be a mistake in my understanding the definition of positivity for the curvature. Let me summarize:
Let $ (L,\nabla,h) \rightarrow M $ be a hermitian hol line bundle with Chern connection. Then one can show (e.g. Huybrechts, complex geometry Prop. 4.3.8) that the curvature $F = \nabla^2 \in \mathcal{A}^{1,1}(M,\mathbb{C})$ is a (1,1)-Form with the property that (i) $h(F_{X,Y}\sigma,\tau)=-h(\sigma,F_{X,Y}\tau) $. Now, writing $F$ in local coordinates $(z_i)$ of $M$, we see $F=\sum_{i,j}F_{Z_i,\bar Z_j}dz_i \wedge d\bar z_j$ where $ a_{ij}:=F_{Z_i,\bar Z_j}$ is a hermitian symmetric matrix.
Now my question is: From the first equality (i) we deduce, that $ F_{X,Y} $ is a purely imaginary complex number. Why isn't this a contradiction to $ a_{ij} $ being hermitian symmetric? The matrix entries of $ a_{ij} $ are special $ F_{X,Y} $, so we get a matrix with purely imaginary entries which cannot be positive definite.

371647,"Finding the locus of the midpoint of chord that subtends a right angle at $(\alpha,\beta)$","There is a circle $x^2+y^2=a^2$. On any line that cuts the circle in two distinct points(it is a secant), the points of intersection with circle are taken and at those two points I draw the tangents that intersect at some point, say $(\alpha,\beta)$. It's given that the tangents intersect at right angles at the point $(\alpha,\beta)$. I need to find the locus of the midpoint of the chord. THE BOOK'S WAY: Let the midpoint be $(h,k)$. Using $T=S_1$ for the equation of chord, the chord is $hx+ky=h^2+k^2$ If the chord intersects the circle at $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, then by condition of perpendicularity 
$$m_1m_2=-1$$
$$({y_1-\beta \over x_1-\alpha})({y_2-\beta \over x_2-\alpha})=-1$$
$$(x_1x_2+y_1y_2)+(\alpha^2+\beta^2)=\alpha(x_1+x_2)+\beta(y_1+y_2)$$
Then using the equation of chord and separately eliminating $x,y$ we obtain quadratics
$$\lambda x^2-2\lambda hx+\lambda^2-a^2k^2=0$$
$$\lambda y^2-2\lambda ky+\lambda^2-a^2h^2=0$$
where $\lambda=h^2+k^2$. Using the values of product of roots and sum of roots, the locus is
$$x^2+y^2-\alpha x-\beta y+{1 \over 2}(\alpha ^2+\beta ^2-a^2)=0$$
MY WAY: I translate the origin to $(\alpha,\beta)$ so that $x=X+\alpha$, $y=Y+\beta$ Circle becomes $X^2+Y^2+2\alpha X+2\beta Y+\alpha^2+\beta^2-a^2=0$ To get the equation of pair of lines that join the circle and chord intersection points to origin(translated), I homogenise the equation of circle, then retranslate the axes to previous origin by using $X=x-\alpha$, $Y=y-\beta$   and then put the sum of coefficent of $x^2$ and coefficient of $y^2$ equal to zero. Then I get an equation that doesn't match the book's answer. What's the flaw?

I understand that as an arrow targeting $A$, it is an object of $C/A$.  However, in $C$, $1_A$ is not practically composable, because it is an identity morphism and $(X\to A) \circ 1_A$ is just reduced to $X\to A$.  This doesn't seem like it would necesarily be the case in $C/A$, because in $C/A$, $1_A$ is not the identity morphism (the commutative diagram that represents $1_A\to 1_A$ should play this role). It seems possible that $1_A\to 1_A$ could be reduced to $1_A$, but I don't know if this is the case and how I would validate it.  If it isn't the case, then it would seem that for every other object, $Z\to A$ in $C/A$, at least two morphisms would exist: #1, $(Z\to A) \to (Z\to A)$, (the identity morphism in $C/A$); and, #2, $(Z\to A)\to (A\to A)$.

And that got me thinking, I don't know of a good interpretation for integrals of functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$. By a good interpretation I mean some (possibly geometric) way of intuitively understanding what such an integral means and why it's calculated like it is. It's easy to understand why, if $\mathbf{r}(t)$ describes the position of a particle at time $t$, then $\int_a^b \mathbf{r}'(t)\ dt = \mathbf{r}(b)-\mathbf{r}(a)$, by imagining lots of small tangents to the curve $\mathbf{r}(t)$ being added up. It's harder to picture what $\int_a^b \mathbf{r}(t)\ dt$ means without thinking of $\mathbf{r}(t)$ as a derivative. Does anyone know of an intuitive interpretation for this kind of integrals?","['multivariable-calculus', 'integration']"

371748,Are geodesic flows on surfaces with negative curvature Anosov?,"I'm just going through the original book by Anosov, where he tries to proof this result.
I don't quite understand it. So let $\phi_t:TM\rightarrow TM$ be a geodesic flow on a compact surface $M$ of negative curvature. Let $\theta=(x,v)\in TM$, then there exists an isomorphism $T_\theta TM\cong T_pM\oplus T_pM$ So how can we find stable and unstable directions and show that vectors in this direction contract or expand exponentially, as it is required by an Anosov flow? First of all, I understand that the direction of the flow itself is invariant and the phase velocity stays constant there.
Then I have also understood that a vector $\xi=(\xi_h,\xi_ v)\in T_pM\oplus T_pM$, that is transversal to the flow direction will have a length that is convex for all $t$, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\Big|\;\xi\;\Big|^2>0

In $\mathbb{R}^n$ the compact sets are those that are closed and bounded, however the guy who answered this question and had his answer accepted says that compactness is some analogue of finiteness .  In my intuitive view of finiteness, only boundedness would suffice to say that a certain subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is in some sense ""finite"". On the other hand there's the other definition of compactness (in terms of covers) which is the one I really need to work with and I cannot see how that definition implies this intuition on finiteness. To prove a set is compact I know they must show that for every open cover there's a finite subcover; the problem is that I can't see intuitively how one could show this for every cover . Also when trying to disprove compactness the books I've read start presenting strange covers that I would have never thought about. I think my real problem is that I didn't yet get the intuition on compactness. So, what intuition should we have about compact sets in general and how should we really put this definition to use?

The problem is that many different binomial sums are known, but I cannot remember among them sums of binomial “polynomials” of degree greater than 1, containing the summation index above. If the summation diapason was a triangle $\{i,j\ge 0:i+j\le 2n\}$ instead of a rectangle $[0;n]\times [0;p]$, a sum should be simplified as follows: $$\sum_{i,j=0}^{i+j\le 2n} \binom {i+j}i^2=\sum_{k=0}^{2n}\sum_{i,j=0}^{i+j=k}\binom ki^2=\sum_{k=0}^{2n}\binom {2k}k.$$ A rough asymptotic of $K(n,n)$ should be $\log K(n,n)\sim n\log n+O(\log n)$, which follows form the bounds: $$\binom {2n}n^2\le K(n,n)= \sum_{i=0}^n\sum_{j=0}^p \binom {i+j}i\binom{i+j}j\le  2(n+1)^2\binom {2n}n^2.$$ Since we are topologists, it is complicated for us to obtain a highly estimated asymptotic, so we decided to ask specialists about that.","['probability-theory', 'asymptotics', 'summation', 'binomial-coefficients']"

So how come the condition of $n = 1$ or $D$ is finite take place?","['matrices', 'abstract-algebra']"
372125,How many positive numbers need to be added together to ensure that the sum is infinite?,"The question in the title is naively stated, so let be make it more precise: Let $\sum_{n\in\alpha}a_n$ be an ordinal-indexed sequence of real numbers such that $a_n>0$ for each $n\in\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is an ordinal number. What is the smallest $\alpha$ which guarantees that $\sum_{n\in\alpha}a_n$ diverges? Since bijections correspond to rearrangements of the sum, and since the $a_n$ are positive, the sum is either absolutely convergent or diverges to $+\infty$ regardless of the order, so it follows that $\alpha$ is a cardinal number. My intuition tells me that $\alpha=\omega_1$, but I can only prove that $\alpha\le\frak{c}^+$, as follows: Let $\sum_{n\in\frak{c}^+}a_n$ be a sum of positive reals with $\frak{c}^+$ terms, and let $s_\beta=\sum_{n\in \beta}a_n$ be the sequence of partial sums, so that $s_{\beta+1}=s_\beta+a_\beta$. Then if $\beta<\gamma$, $s_\beta<s_\beta+a_\beta=s_{\beta+1}\le s_\gamma$, so in particular, the $\{s_\beta\}$ are all distinct, and $|\{s_\beta\}|=\frak{c}^+$. If $\sum_{n\in\frak{c}^+}a_n=A$ is finite, then every partial sum is less than $A$, so $\{s_\beta\}\subseteq [0,A]\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, so $\frak{c}^+=|\{s_\beta\}|\le|\mathbb{R}|=\frak{c}$, a contradiction. Thus $\sum_{n\in\frak{c}^+}a_n$ is not finite. As indicated above, $\alpha\ge\omega_1$ is obvious because $\alpha$ is a cardinal, and $\sum_{n\in\omega}2^{-n}=2$ is finite, so $\alpha>\omega$. Can anyone prove that $\alpha\le\frak{c}$ or that $\alpha=\frak{c}^+$? I can't imagine any set of positive numbers indexed by reals whose sum could possibly be finite, so I lean strongly toward $\alpha\le\frak{c}$, but I don't know how to prove it.","['set-theory', 'sequences-and-series', 'ordinals']"

I know this is a surface integral of the form $$A(S) = \int\int_s dS$$ I computed dS, $dS = \sqrt{1+{\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}}^2 + {\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}}^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 +2}$ Then I integrate this function over the region... $\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \sqrt{4x^2+2} dydx$

372293,The Axiom of Choice and definability,"I've seen a lot of relations between the notion of the existence of a definable set with a given property and the necessity of AC is proving that there is a set with the property. For example: Under ZFC, the reals can be well-ordered, and under ZF, it is consistent that the reals cannot be well-ordered. There is no definable well-order of the reals. Under ZFC, there is a Lebesgue-nonmeasurable set, and under ZF, it is consistent that every subset of the reals is Lebesgue-measurable. There is no definable Lebesgue-nonmeasurable set. How does one formalize or prove this relationship, either in general or for particular cases such as these? It makes some intuitive sense to me that the sets described in the axioms of ZF can all be described via comprehensions (i.e. $\bigcup X=\{x|\exists y\in X:x\in y\}$, $\{a,b\}=\{x|x=a\vee x=b\}$, $f(X)=\{x|\exists y\in X:x=f(y)\}$, and so on), while the choice function described in AC is inherently not definable given only its domain, so facts which are provably dependent on AC must also inherit this nonconstructive nature, but I have no idea how to prove any of that.","['logic', 'elementary-set-theory', 'model-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"

$\mathbf{Y}(u)= (x_1(u), x_2(u), …, x_{N}(u))$, with $u$ denotes the $N-1$ local coordinates on the surface. I verified that two formulas for 2D surfaces as $div \mathbf{N}=-H $ (Eq.
