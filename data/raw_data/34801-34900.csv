332011,Why is the tensor product constructed in this way?,"I've already asked about the definition of tensor product here and now I understand the steps of the construction. I'm just in doubt about the motivation to construct it in that way. Well, if all that we want is to have tuples of vectors that behave linearly on addition and multiplication by scalar, couldn't we just take all vector spaces $L_1, L_2,\dots,L_p$, form their cartesian product $L_1\times L_2\times \cdots \times L_p$ and simply introduce operations analogous to that of $\mathbb{R}^n$ ? We would get a space of tuples of vectors on wich all those linear properties are obeyed. What's the reason/motivation to define the tensor product using the free vector space and that quotient to impose linearity ? Can someone point me out the motivation for that definition ? Thanks very much in advance.","['motivation', 'abstract-algebra', 'tensor-products', 'linear-algebra', 'multilinear-algebra']"
332019,Log-likelihood for multinominal normal distribution,"Given $n$ jointly-normal random variables $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$, with 
$$\mu_i=\mu\forall i \in\mathbb{N}^+$$
$$\sigma_i=\sigma\forall i$$
$$\rho_{i,j}=\rho\forall i,j \mbox{ with } i\neq j$$
what is their log-likelihood function? My idea is the following:
Be $\mathbf{x}=(X_1,X_2, \dots,X_n)^T$ the vector of observed values and $\mu=(\mu, \dots,\mu)^T$ a $n\times1$-Vektor. Then the $n\times n$ covariance matrix is given by $\Sigma$ with all diagonal elements being $\sigma^2$ and all other entries $\rho\sigma^2$. The log-likelihood is given by:
$$ L(\mu, \sigma, \rho) =\log [ exp(\frac{-1}{2}(\mathbf{x}-\mu)^T)\Sigma^{-1}(\mathbf{x}-\mu))]$$ Is this correct?","['statistics', 'normal-distribution']"
332023,Semidirect Products and the definition of a function.,"When we say $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is a function, we mean that we take elements in $X$ and end up with elements in $Y$, right? But semidirect products are confusing me... Definition Let $\alpha: K \rightarrow \text{Aut}(H)$ be a homomorphism. By the semidirect product of $H$ and $K$ with respect to $\alpha$, written $H \rtimes_{\phi} K$, we mean the set $H\times K$ with the binary operation given by setting $$(h_1, k_1) \cdot (h_2, k_2) = (h_1, \alpha(k_1)(h_2), k_1k_2).$$ This is confusing me, because we are not taking elements from K and ending up with elements in $\text{Aut}(H)$...since $(h_1, k_1) \not\in K$. Can anybody please clarify this for me? Thanks in advance","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

332108,Showing that every connected open set in a locally path connected space is path connected,"I'm trying to figure out whether my proof is correct for a question I'm trying to tackle in Topology by James R. Munkres. Task : Let $X$ be locally path connected. Show that every connected open set in $X$ is path connected. My attempt at a proof : Well, every open subset of the locally path connected space $X$ is locally path connected. In addition, the path components and components of $X$ are the same in view of Theorem $25.5$ (p. $162$), which states that if a space $X$ is locally path connected, then the components and the path components of $X$ are the same. Altogether, this implies that then every connected open set in $X$ is path connected. Am I right, or do I need to make any changes? Please provide your input, thanks.",['general-topology']
332111,How do I find the limit of the sequence $a_n=\frac{n\cos(n)}{n^2+1}$ and prove it is a Cauchy sequence?,"I need to study the limit behavior of $a_n=\frac{n\cos(n)}{n^2+1}$, which can be written as $\frac{n}{n^2+1}\cos(n).$ I knew that it wasn't going to be monotone because $cos(n)$ oscillates between -1 and 1, so I attempted to prove it was Cauchy. I think I did it the right way: $a_n$ is a Cauchy sequence if for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists an $N$ such that $|a_m-a_n|<\epsilon$ for $m,n>N$
$$|a_m-a_n|= \bigg|\frac{m\cos(m)}{m^2+1}-\frac{ncos(n)}{n^2+1}\bigg|\leq\bigg|\frac{m\cos(m)}{m^2+1}\bigg|+\bigg|\frac{n\cos(n)}{n^2+1}\bigg|=\frac{|m\cos(m)|}{m^2+1}+\frac{|n\cos(n)|}{n^2+1}\leq\frac{m}{m^2+1}+\frac{n}{n^2+1}\leq \frac{m+n}{mn}=\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{m}<\frac{1}{N}+\frac{1}{N}=\frac{2}{N}<\epsilon$$ Thus there exists an $N$, namely $N>\frac{2}{\epsilon}$ such that $m,n>N$ implies $|a_m-a_n|<\epsilon$. That is how I proved that the sequence is a Cauchy sequence. Was my work correct? Also, I have a feeling that the limit of this sequence is $0$ because $\frac{n}{n^2+1}$ tends to $0$. This assumption makes me want to show that $\lim \bigg|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\bigg|=L<1$ which would imply that $\lim|a_n|=0$. This doesn't get me very far because I cant find a way to simplify it and find the limit L, and I end up with a big mess. Any hints on how I should approach finding the limit?

332130,Prove that $\mathcal{P}(A)⊆ \mathcal{P}(B)$ if and only if $A⊆B$. [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Prove/Disprove that if two sets have the same power set then they are the same set (3 answers) Closed 11 years ago . Here is my proof, I would appreciate it if someone could critique it for me: To prove this statement true, we must proof that the two conditional statements (""If $\mathcal{P}(A)⊆ \mathcal{P}(B)$, then $A⊆B$,"" and, If $A⊆B$, then $\mathcal{P}(A)⊆ \mathcal{P}(B)$) are true. Contrapositive of the first statement: If $A \nsubseteq B$, then $\mathcal{P}(A) \nsubseteq \mathcal{P}(B)$ If $A \nsubseteq B$, then there must be some element in $A$, call it $x$, that is not in $B$: $x \in A$, and $x \notin B$. Since $x \in A$, then $\{x\} \in \mathcal{P}(A)$; moreover, since $x \notin B$, then $\{x\} \notin \mathcal{P}(B)$, which proves that, if $A \nsubseteq B$, then $\mathcal{P}(A) \nsubseteq \mathcal{P}(B)$. By proving the contrapositive true, the original proposition must be true. To prove the second statement true, I would implement nearly the same argument, so that isn't necessary to write. So, does this proof seem correct? Also, was the contrapositive necessary? Or is there another way to prove the initial statement?","['discrete-mathematics', 'proof-writing']"

In this way the saddle isn't symmetric and I want to determine the curve which has the same role of the ""less wide parabola"" of the first case (so where to put my legs comfortably in a certain sense) I thought that a possible solution could be to calculate the gradient field (which is immediate since only derivations are needed) and then determine the path which goes through the ""steepest descent"" through the gradients.

332279,Problem with the Lebesgue integral of Dirichlet function,"According to all sources $\int\limits_{[0,1]}{{{\chi }_{\mathbb{Q}\cap [0,1]}}\left( x \right)}dx=0$ (Lebesgue integral out of Dirichlet funtion). However, below I constructed a sequence of functions ${{f}_{n}}$ which converges to $\underset{n\to \infty }{\mathop{\lim }}\,{{f}_{n}}(x)=\Phi (x)$ and ${{\chi }_{\mathbb{Q}\cap [0,1]}}\left( x \right)=\Phi (x)$ $\underset{n\to \infty }{\mathop{\lim }}\,\int\limits_{[0,1]}{{{f}_{n}}(x)}dx=\int\limits_{[0,1]}{\Phi (x)}dx=p\in (0,1)$ so $p$ is an arbitrary number from the interval (0,1). This is a contradiction because $\int\limits_{[0,1]}{{{\chi }_{\mathbb{Q}\cap [0,1]}}\left( x \right)}dx=0$. Maybe somebody will be able to find a problem in my reasoning ... The biggest problem in the method is the assumption that [\Phi (x)=0] for $x$ which is irrational number in the interval [0,1]. In my opinion I proved that it is true. Do you agree with my reasoning (see below for details). Let us consider characteristic function of the set $\mathbb{Q}\cap [0,1]$ (Dirichlet funtion)
${{\chi }_{\mathbb{Q}\cap [0,1]}}\left( x \right)=\left\{ \begin{align}
  & 1\text{ for }x\in \mathbb{Q}\cap [0,1] \\ 
 & 0\text{ for }x\notin \mathbb{Q}\cap [0,1] \\ 
\end{align} \right.$
Let $\left\{ {{a}_{i}} \right\}_{i=1}^{\infty }$ be a sequence which contains all rational numbers i.e. $\mathbb{Q}=\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty }{\left\{ {{a}_{i}} \right\}}$.
Let’s define the following function
${{f}_{n}}(x)=\left\{ \begin{align}
  & 1\text{ if }\underset{i\in \{1,...,n\}}{\mathop{\exists }}\,x\in \left[ {{a}_{i}}-\delta _{i,n}^{-},{{a}_{i}}+\delta _{i,n}^{+} \right] \\ 
 & 0\text{ otherwise} \\ 
\end{align} \right.$ where 
$\delta _{i,n}^{+}-\delta _{i,n}^{-}={{\delta }_{n}}$ and $p=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{{{\delta }_{n}}}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{\left( \delta _{i,n}^{+}-\delta _{i,n}^{-} \right)}$
and $p\in (0,1)$. For every sequence of rational numbers $\left\{ {{a}_{i}} \right\}_{i=1}^{\infty }$ and $1>p>0$ it is possible to construct the intervals $\left[ {{a}_{i}}-\delta _{i,n}^{-},{{a}_{i}}+\delta _{i,n}^{+} \right]$ such that $p=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{{{\delta }_{n}}}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{\left( \delta _{i,n}^{+}-\delta _{i,n}^{-} \right)}$ and $\left[ {{a}_{i}}-\delta _{i,n}^{-},{{a}_{i}}+\delta _{i,n}^{+} \right]\cap \left[ {{a}_{j}}-\delta _{j,n}^{-},{{a}_{j}}+\delta _{j,n}^{+} \right]=\varnothing $. In order to do that first it is necessary to construct a sequence of intervals
$\left[ {{a}_{i}}-\varepsilon _{i,n}^{-},{{a}_{i}}+\varepsilon _{i,n}^{+} \right]$ such that $1=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{{{\varepsilon }_{n}}}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{\left( \varepsilon _{i,n}^{+}-\varepsilon _{i,n}^{-} \right)}$ and $\left( {{a}_{i}}-\varepsilon _{i,n}^{-},{{a}_{i}}+\varepsilon _{i,n}^{+} \right)\cap \left( {{a}_{j}}-\varepsilon _{j,n}^{-},{{a}_{j}}+\varepsilon _{j,n}^{+} \right)=\varnothing $. For any fixed $n>1$ it is possible to order all $\{{{a}_{1}},...,{{a}_{n}}\}$ such that ${{a}_{{{\alpha }_{1}}}}<{{a}_{{{\alpha }_{2}}}}<...<{{a}_{{{\alpha }_{n}}}}$.

332341,Bodyguards and Laser Beams,"Suppose you are a point in a square room.  The walls of the room are mirrors, and there is a man with a laser gun standing somewhere else in the room.  The man is also a point, and both of your positions are fixed points, that is, neither of you can move.  A beam from the laser will bounce off of the walls of the room at an angle equal to its angle of incidence.  To protect yourself, you are allowed to place any number of bodyguards (possibly infinitely many) at any points in the room.  The laser beam will stop if it hits a bodyguard. Is there an arrangement of finitely many bodyguards that completely protects you from being shot?  If so, what is the largest number of bodyguards you need to protect yourself no matter how you and the gunman are placed in the room? I encountered this problem a while back, and haven't been able to solve it.  An initial idea is to tile the plane with 'rooms' and translate your image into each square, but only draw the gunman in one of the tiles.  Then all possible fatal shots are represented by a segment from the shooter to one of your images.  Somehow, we must place bodyguards along these segments, and cover each one. A simple generalization of this problem is to begin with a room of a different shape (triangle, hexagon, circle, etc.).  I imagine these problems could get quite tough, for instance, my approach above would only work with shapes that tile the plane.","['geometry', 'puzzle']"

Consider the closure of $V$, $\overline{V}$. Then since $V$ is dense in $\overline{V}$, there exists a unique extension $\overline{f}$ of $f$ to $\overline{V}$. Moreover since $\overline{V}$ is a closed subspace of $H$ then it is also a Hilbert space, so by the Frechet-Riesz theorem we have $\overline{f}(v)$ = $\langle v,y_{\space\overline{f}} \rangle$ for some unique element $y_{\space\overline{f}} \in \overline{V}$ Take $ h(x) = \langle x,y_{\space\overline{f}} \rangle$.

332362,Can an uncountable family of positive-measure sets be such that each point belongs to only finitely many of them?,"Suppose $M$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure space, and $\Gamma$ a set of positive-measure subsets of $M$ such that every point in $M$ belongs to only finitely many members of $\Gamma$.  Must $\Gamma$ be countable?  (And if the answer to this question is no for general σ-finite measures, is it also no for, say, Lebesgue measure?) • I can see that if the conjecture that Γ has to be countable is true when $M$ has finite measure, it must be also be true when $M$ is σ-finite.  (Just decompose $M$ into $M_0 ∪ M_1 ∪ \ldots$ where each $M_i$ is finite-measure.  For each $i$, only countably many of Γ will have positive measure intersection with $M_i$; but every member of Γ must have positive-measure overlap with some $M_i$, so Γ must be countable.)  So we can focus on the case where $M$ is finite measure. • I can prove the following weaker result: suppose $M$ is finite-measure and Γ a set of positive-measure subsets of $M$ such that every point in $M$ belongs to at most $n$ members of Γ, then Γ must be countable.  (For each ε>0, at most $nμ(M)/ε$ members of Γ have measure ≥ε.  So we can enumerate all the members of Γ by first enumerating those with measure≥1, then those with measure ≥1/2, then those with measure ≥1/4, etc.) • Returning to the original conjecture, I can see how to prove it if only I could take it for granted that for each $i$, the set $E_i$ of points in $M$ that belong to exactly $i$ members of Γ is measurable.  In that case, I could first use the weaker result to show that for each $i$, at most countably many members of Γ have positive-measure overlap with $E_i$, and then argue that since $M = E_0 ∪ E_1 ∪ \ldots$ and the $E_i$ are measurable, every member of Γ must have positive-measure overlap with at least one of the $E_i$, establishing that Γ is itself countable.  Unfortunately this doesn't work if the $E_i$ aren't measurable, and I don't see any way to show that they are.

332369,Log-concave functions whose sums are still log-concave: possible to find a subset?,"Rationale: I am puzzled by a problem of log-concavity, which arises in population dynamics where the curvature of the logarithm of sums is a quantity of interest. It is well-known that sums of log-convex functions are log-convex (used in Cohen 1980, ref. below). 
However, not all sums of log-concave functions are also log-concave. This is important to me because many convex functions are log-concave. My investigation so far suggests that log-concavity of the sum is frequent when the functions are log-concave but convex, and similar. I would therefore like to delineate the set of real-valued log-concave AND convex functions whose sums are log-concave, conditional on some further restrictions. Any hint appreciated. Formal definition of the problem: Let $r(x) = \ln(b(x)+s(x))$ be the quantity of interest, with $b$ and $s$ functions obeying properties P0-4. P0: Defined over some interval $I=[0, x_c] , x_c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ P1: Positive P2: Increasing P3: Convex P4: Log-concave ($\forall x \in I, \ln(f(x))''<0$, $f=b,s$) What additional conditions on $b(x)$ and $s(x)$ are needed to obtain $r''(x)<0$? Two instructive cases: Let's assume $b(x)=b_m f(x), s(x)=s_m f(x)$, with $f(x)$ obeying P0-4. 
Then $r(x) = \ln(b_m f(x)+s_m f(x))= \ln(s_m+b_m) + \ln(f(x))$. 
If $b,s$ obey P0-4, then $\ln(f(x))''<0$ which implies $r''(x)<0$. Here the two functions are nearly equal, but numerical investigations suggest that whenever first and second derivatives of $b(x)$ and $s(x)$ are relatively close, log-concavity follows. Power functions are good examples of convex yet log-concave functions. Let us assume that $s(x)=x^{1+\alpha}$ and $b(x)=x^\beta$, $\alpha,\beta>0$. Using $\alpha = 1$ so that $s(x) = x^2$, one can show numerically that $r(x)$ is concave if $\beta<6$. When $\beta>6$, for some values $x_0 \approx 1$, we observe $r''(x_0)>0$. General question: Q0. Has this problem been treated previously? If yes, for what kind of functions? Polynomials? Questions on possible ways to tackle the problem: Q1. A sufficient condition for log-concavity of the sum ($r''(x)<0$) is log-concavity of $1+b(x)/s(x)$. Could that lead somewhere, studying properties of the ratio $b(x)/s(x)$? Q2. Flipping the problem on its head, log-convexity of the sum (i.e. $r''(x)>0$) yields a necessary condition $b''(x)s(x)-b'(x)s'(x)>0$ (or equivalent one exchanging $b$ and $s$). Proof: developing $f''(x)f(x)-f'(x)^2>0$ with $f=b+s$. Rewriting the above expression suggests $k(x)=b'(x)/s(x)$ has to verify $\ln(k(x))'>0$. 
Is this a worthwhile thread of research, or should I try directly to get sufficient conditions? Q3. Numerical investigations suggest that two conditions are necessary to meet $\exists x_0 \in I, r''(x_0)>0$: $s(x_0)$ and $b(x_0)$ of commensurate values. Otherwise, the behaviour of one function dominates that of the other, $\ln(b(x)+s(x)) \approx_{x_0} \ln(b(x))$, if $b(x_0)>>s(x_0)$. $s''(x_0)$ and $b''(x_0)$ are very dissimilar (e.g. $6 \times 5 >> 2$ for $x \approx 1$ in the power function example with $\alpha=1$).

332667,Alternative Almost Complex Structures,"Let $V$ be a real vector space. An almost complex structure on $V$ is a map $J : V \to V$ such that $J^2 = -\mathrm{id}_V$ . An almost complex structure gives $V$ the structure of a complex vector space by defining $(a+bi)v = av + bJ(v)$ . The idea behind this definition is that $J$ represents multiplication by $i$ . What if you instead consider multiplication by other complex numbers? Let $n > 2$ be a fixed positive integer and let $J : V \to V$ be such that $J^n = -\mathrm{id}_V$ which I will refer to as an alternative almost complex structure . One can regard $J$ as trying to capture multiplication by $\zeta = \exp\left(\frac{\pi i}{n}\right)$ . In particular, as $\{1, \zeta\}$ is linearly independent over $\mathbb{R}$ , it is a basis for $\mathbb{C}$ as a real vector space. One can then endow $V$ with a complex structure by defining $(a + b\zeta)v = av + bJ(v)$ . Do alternative almost complex structures give rise to the same results as the standard almost complex structures?

332669,Exchangeability via Symmetric Functions,"There are three ways to define the exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of a stochastic process: one via symmetric functions, another via $n$-symmetric functions and a third via exchangeable events. Why are these three formulations equivalent? Denote by $S(n)$ ($n\in\mathbb{N}_1$) (with $\mathbb{N}_1=\left\{1,2,3,\dots\right\}$ the set of positive integers) the set consisting of all bijections $\rho:\mathbb{N}_1\rightarrow\mathbb{N}_1$ that leave all numbers $>n$ unchanged. If $D$, $E$ are non-empty sets, $x=\left(x_1, x_2, \dots\right)\in E^{\mathbb{N}_1}$ and $\rho:\mathbb{N}_1\rightarrow\mathbb{N}_1$, $x^\rho$ will denote $\left(x_{\rho(1)},x_{\rho(2)},\dots\right)$. If $f:D\rightarrow E^{\mathbb{N}_1}$ and $\rho:\mathbb{N}_1\rightarrow\mathbb{N}_1$, $f^\rho:D\rightarrow E^{\mathbb{N}_1}$ will denote the function $f^\rho(x):=[f(x)]^\rho$. $f:E^{\mathbb{N}_1}\rightarrow D$ will be called $n$-symmetric (for a fixed $n\in\mathbb{N}_1$) iff $f(x)=f(x^\rho)$ for all $x\in E$ and $\rho\in S(n)$. $f$ will be called symmetric iff it is $n$-symmetric for all $n\in\mathbb{N}_1$. Let $X=\left(X_n\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}_1}$ be a sequence of random objects defined over the measurable space $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A}\right)$, each taking values in the measurable space $\left(E,\mathcal{B}\right)$. If $B\in\otimes_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{B}$ (the product $\sigma$-algebra), we will define $B^\rho:=\left\{X^\rho\in B\right\}$ for $\rho:\mathbb{N}_1\rightarrow\mathbb{N}_1$. $B$ will be called range-side $n$-symmetric (for a fixed $n\in\mathbb{N}_1$) iff $B^\rho=X^{-1}(B)$ for every $\rho\in S(n)$. $B$ will be called range-side symmetric iff it is range-side $n$-symmetric for all $n\in\mathbb{N}_1$. It is easy to verify that the collection of range-side $n$-symmetric events is a sub-$\sigma$-algebra of $\otimes_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{B}$. It will be denoted by $\mathcal{D}_n$ and referred to as the range-side $n$-exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of $X$ . It is likewise easy to see that $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{D}_n$ is the collection of range-side symmetric events, which is therefore a $\sigma$-algebra too. It will be denoted by $\mathcal{D}$ and referred to as the range-side exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of $X$ . With $\mathfrak{B}$ denoting the Borel field on the real line, define $$\begin{array}{lcl}
\mathcal{E}_n & := & \sigma\left(\bigcup\left\{\left.\left(f\circ X\right)^{-1}\left(\mathfrak{B}\right):\right|\space f:E^{\mathbb{N}_1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\space\mathrm{is}\otimes_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{B}\space/\space\mathfrak{B}\space\mathrm{-measurable}\space\mathrm{and}\space n\mathrm{-symmetric}\right\}\right) \\

\mathcal{F}_n & := & X^{-1}\left(\mathcal{D}_n\right) \\
\mathcal{F} & := & X^{-1}\left(\mathcal{D}\right)
\end{array}$$ According to Klenke (Definition 12.6 and Remark 12.7), $\mathcal{E}_n=\mathcal{F}_n$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}_1$ and $\mathcal{E}=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{E}_n=\mathcal{F}$ The collection in 1 is the domain-side $n$-exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of $X$ ; its members are the domain-side $n$-symmetric events of $X$ . The collection in 2 is the domain-side exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of $X$, or simply the exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of $X$ ; its members are the domain-side symmetric events of $X$ , or simply the symmetric events of $X$ . I see why $\mathcal{E}_n\subseteq\mathcal{F}_n$ and why $\mathcal{E}\subseteq\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{E}_n\subseteq\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{F}_n=\mathcal{F}$. Any help with proving the converse containments required to establish Klenke's claims, namely $\mathcal{F}_n\subseteq\mathcal{E}_n$ and $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathcal{E}$, will be appreciated. Comments There are a couple possible alternative definitions of an exchangeable $\sigma$-field. After defining them, i will explore their relation to the $\sigma$-algebras defined above. The first alternative definition is due to David Freedman (p. 39). An event $B\in\otimes_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{B}$ will be called range-side $n$-symmetric of the 2nd kind iff $x\in B\implies x^\rho\in B$ for all $x\in E^{\mathbb{N}_1}$ and all $\rho\in S(n)$. It will be called range-side symmetric of the 2nd kind iff it is $n$-symmetric of the 2nd kind for all $n\in\mathbb{N}_1$. The collection of range-side $n$-symmetric events of the 2nd kind (for a fixed $n\in\mathbb{N}_1$) constitutes a $\sigma$-algebra that will be denoted $\mathcal{D}_n^{(2)}$ and called the range-side $n$-exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of the 2nd kind . The intersection $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{D}_n^{(2)}$ is the collection of range-side symmetric events of the 2nd kind, which is therefore a $\sigma$-algebra that will be denoted $\mathcal{D}^{(2)}$ and called the range-side exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of the 2nd kind . $X^{-1}\left(\mathcal{D}_n^{(2)}\right)$ will be denoted $\mathcal{F}_n^{(2)}$ and called the domain-side $n$-exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of the 2nd kind of $X$ , its members - the domain-side $n$-symmetric events of the 2nd kind of $X$ . Similarly, $X^{-1}\left(\mathcal{D}^{(2)}\right)$ will be denoted $\mathcal{F}^{(2)}$ and called the domain-side exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of the 2nd kind of $X$ (or simply the exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of the 2nd kind of $X$ ), its members - the domain-side symmetric events of the 2nd kind of $X$ (or simply the symmetric events of the 2nd kind of $X$ ). The second alternative set of definitions derives from Klenke's definition (12.1) of an exchangeable sequence of random objects over a probability space. Suppose, then, that a measure $\mu$ is defined on $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A}\right)$ and denote by $\mu_X$ its distribution, i.e. the measure induced on $\left(E^{\mathbb{N}_1},\otimes_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{B}\right)$ by $X$. For each $\rho\in\mathbb{N}_1\rightarrow\mathbb{N}_1$ write $\mu^\rho:=\mu_{X^\rho}$, i.e. the measure induced on $\left(E^{\mathbb{N}_1},\otimes_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{B}\right)$ by $X^\rho$. Then $B\in\otimes_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{B}$ will be called a range-side $n$-symmetric event of the 3rd kind iff $\mu_X(B)=\mu^\rho(B)$ for all $\rho\in S(n)$ (for a fixed $n\in\mathbb{N}_1$). It will be called a range-side symmetric event of the 3rd kind iff it is an $n$-symmetric event of the 3rd kind for all $n\in\mathbb{N}_1$. The collection of all range-side $n$-symmetric events of the 3rd kind (for a fixed $n\in\mathbb{N}_1$) is a $\sigma$-algebra that will be denoted $\mathcal{D}_n^{(3)}$ and called the range-side $n$-exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of the 3rd kind . $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{D}_n^{(3)}$ is the collection of range-side exchangeable events of the 3rd kind, which is therefore a $\sigma$-algebra that will be denoted $\mathcal{D}^{(3)}$ and called the range-side exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of the 3rd kind . A ""domain-side ($n$-)exchangeable $\sigma$-algebra of the 3rd kind"" will not be defined. It is interesting to note that the definition of $\mathcal{D}^{(2)}$ makes no use of either $X$ or $\mu$, the definition of $\mathcal{D}$ relies on $X$ but not on $\mu$ and the definition of $\mathcal{D}^{(3)}$ relies on both $X$ and $\mu$. It is evident that $\mathcal{D}_n^{(2)}\subseteq\mathcal{D}_n\subseteq\mathcal{D}_n^{(3)}$ and that $\mathcal{D}^{(2)}\subseteq\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{D}^{(3)}$. Similarly, $\mathcal{F}_n^{(2)}\subseteq\mathcal{F}_n$ and $\mathcal{F}^{(2)}\subseteq\mathcal{F}$. It is also easy to check that $$\begin{array}{lcl}
\mathcal{D}_n^{(2)} & = & \bigcup\left\{\left.f^{-1}\left(\mathfrak{B}\right):\right|\space f:E^{\mathbb{N}_1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\space\mathrm{is}\otimes_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{B}\space/\space\mathfrak{B}\space\mathrm{-measurable}\space\mathrm{and}\space n\mathrm{-symmetric}\right\} \\
\mathcal{D}^{(2)} & = & \bigcup\left\{\left.f^{-1}

332793,Trichotomy of well ordering,"I'm trying to prove trichotomy of well ordering and I have a question concerning the proof of the following fact: If $(A,\triangleleft_A)$ and $(B,\triangleleft_B )$ are two well ordered sets, then the following statements cannot be both true: $$
\textbf{1.} \ \exists a\in A \  \text{s.t.} \ pred(A,a,\triangleleft_A)\cong (B,\triangleleft_B),\\
\textbf{2.} \ \exists b\in B \ \text{s.t.} \ (A,\triangleleft_A) \cong pred(B,b,\triangleleft_B).
$$ Likely wrong proof: Suppose that $\textbf{1}$ and $\textbf{2}$ hold. Let us define the function $$g:pred(B,b,\triangleleft_B)\rightarrow pred(A,a,\triangleleft_A).$$ From $\textbf{1}$ , since $\forall b'\in pred(B,b,\triangleleft_B)$ ,  we have $g(b')=a'$ with $a'\in pred(A,a,\triangleleft_A)$ , then $g$ is injective. In general it is not surjective because an element of $pred(A,a,\triangleleft_A)$ can be mapped in $B\setminus pred(B,b,\triangleleft_B)$ . But now, if $a''\in pred(A,a,\triangleleft_A)$ is such that $g^{-1}(a'')=b$ , can we say that the function $$
h:pred(B,b,\triangleleft_B)\rightarrow pred(A,a'',\triangleleft_A)
$$ is surjective and order preserving (taking advantage of the properties of $g$ and of the isomorphism in the hypothesis)? In such a case, since $h$ inherits the injectivity from $g$ , it would be an isomorphism and, from $\textbf{2}$ we would get the contradiction: $$
(A,\triangleleft_A) \cong pred(B,b,\triangleleft_B) \cong pred(A,a'',\triangleleft_A),
$$ that is, $(A,\triangleleft_A)$ would be isomorphic to an initial segment of itself.

332851,Showing that a modifying function which is continuous at 0 is uniformly continuous,"This is the definition of a modifying function I've got to work with: In this problem, a function $\phi :[0,\infty)\rightarrow [0,\infty)$ is called a modifying function if (a) $\phi (0)=0$ (b) $\phi $ is strictly increasing (c) $\phi$ is subadditive; i.e. $\phi (s+t) \leq \phi (s)+\phi (t)$ for all $s,t \in [0,\infty)$. The idea is to show that a modifying function which is continuous at 0 is uniformly continuous. My question: Is the following proof correct or is at least the reasoning correct? If $\phi$ is continuous at $0$, then $0<|t-0|<\delta \Rightarrow |\phi (t)-\phi(0)|<\epsilon $, or using (a) and that $\phi$ is positive, $t<\delta \Rightarrow \phi (t)<\epsilon $. Then we have that for any $s,t\in [0,\infty)$:  $s<\frac{\delta}{2} \Rightarrow \phi (s)<\frac{\epsilon}{ 2} $ and  $t<\frac{\delta}{2} \Rightarrow \phi (t)<\frac{\epsilon}{ 2}$. But then $\phi (s+t)\leq \phi (s) + \phi(t) < \epsilon$, and since $s+t$ is an arbitrary number in $[0,\infty) $ that is larger than $s$ or $t$, $\phi$ must be uniformly continuous.

Suppose that $x \in \overline{(A \cap B \cap C)}$; for $x$ to be in this set, $x$ can't be in $(A \cap B \cap C)$, that is, $X \notin (A \cap B \cap C)$. This means that $x$ can't be in $A$, $B$, and $C$ ; however, by this fact, $x$ can be in $\overline{A}$, $\overline{B}$, or $\overline{C}$.

$$R^jS^i$$ CORRECTED Now, since $\omega$ is a primitive $2^n$-th root of unity, we can let $j$ range over $1\leq j\leq 2^n$ to get all possible powers $R^j$ for $j\in \Bbb Z$.
