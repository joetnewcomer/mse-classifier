1393976,Relationship between two integrals,"I'm reviewing for an intro calculus exam, and the following problem appears on a past final exam: If: $$\int^3_1 \frac{1}{x^4\sqrt{1+x}}\, dx = k$$ What is:
 $$\int^3_1 \frac{1}{x^5\sqrt{1+x}}\, dx $$ (I'm assuming the answer will be in terms of $k$) It seems that most basic integration techniques(substitution, integration by parts, trig sub, etc.) will not allow the solution of the integral, and I'm not sure how else to approach this problem at my level. I've run this by both my lecturers, and they cannot find a solution in a reasonable amount of time either. I'm curious because it seems the there would be a simple solution or rule I'm ignorant of (considering this is on an intro calc exam), but I'm stumped. Where am I going wrong?

1393992,How many bitstrings of length 8 contain 5 consecutive 0's?,"I worked this problem using a recursive sequence, i.e. it can end in 
$1$, leaving $a_{n-1}$, or $10$, leaving $a_{n-2}$, $100$ leaving $a_{n-3}$, $1000$ leaving $a_{n-4}$, $10000$ leaving $a_{n-5}$, and finally $00000$ leaving $2^{n-5}$ possibilities. $a_{0}=a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=a_{4}=0$
Then I worked it up to $n=8: a_{5}=1, a_{6}=1+2^{6-5}=3, a_{7}=3+1+2^{7-5}=8, a_{8}=8+3+1+2^{8-3}=20$. My question is, aside from counting each individual bit string (which I did, by the way), how else can this type of problem be worked? Thanks!",['discrete-mathematics']
1393993,Counting the size of the largest sets of independent strings,"This question derives from a PPCG coding challenge I posed previously. For a given positive integer $n$ , consider all binary strings of length $2n-1$ .  For a given string $S$ , let $L$ be an array of length $n$ which contains the count of the number of $1$ s in each substring of length $n$ of $S$ . For example, if $n=3$ and $S = 01010$ then $L=[1,2,1]$ . We call $L$ the counting array of $S$ . We say that two strings $S1$ and $S2$ of the same length match if their respective counting arrays $L1$ and $L2$ have the property that $L1[i] \leq 2*L2[i]$ and $L2[i] \leq 2*L1[i]$ for all $i$ . Problem For increasing $n$ starting at $n=1$ , we want to compute the size of the largest set of strings, each of length $2n-1$ so that no two strings match. Known answers For $n=1,2,3,4,5$ the optimal answers are $2,4,10,16,31$ . For $n=6,7,8,9,10$ , the best known values are $47, 76, 112, 168, 235$ from a combination of the answers of joriki and Peter Taylor. The question Plotting these values they appear to be subexponential but it is hard to say much more than that. This leads to the question: How do optimal solutions scale with $n$ ?

1393994,Can one have a nontrivial 'resolution of singularities' of a smooth variety?,"Suppose $z_1,z_2$ are coordinates on $\mathbb{A}^2$ and $(w_1,w_2)$ homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^1$. We can define a subvariety $X \subset \mathbb{A}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ by $w_1z_2 - w_2z_1 = 0$. Then this is smooth (right?) and the projection $\pi:X \rightarrow \mathbb{A}^2$ is an isomorphism away from $(0,0)$, but $\pi^{-1}(0,0)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$. So my question is: Is this a valid resolution of singularities, or am I misunderstanding the definition of a resolution of singularities. For reference: I thought that if $f:X' \rightarrow X$ is a proper map, $X'$ is smooth, and there is a dense open set $U$ of $X'$ such that $f\mid_U$ is an isomorphism, then $f$ is a resolution of singularities.",['algebraic-geometry']
1394016,Existence of fair parallel queues,"I just spent a few days at a major theme park.  The queue for one particular ride (involving pirates) bifurcated upon entry; the two sides wound independently through a maze and emerged next to each other at the other side.  Two people nearby were debating whether both sides had the same physical length, or whether one side was shorter.  I spent lots of time in queues that day mulling over the following problem: Define an $(m,n,k)$-queue to be an $m\times n$ grid, together with $k$ disjoint paths from one of the $m$-long sides to the other, such that each grid point is contained in one path; each of the paths has the same length; the entry points are contiguous, and the exit points are contiguous. Question: What are necessary and sufficient conditions on $m$, $n$ and $k$ such that there exists an $(m,n,k)$-queue? As examples, below are pictures of $(6,6,k)$-queues for $k=1,2,3,4,6$. There are some obvious necessary conditions.  First, $k$ must divide $mn$ (and the common path length is $l=mn/k$).  Second, $k\le m$.  However, these conditions are not sufficient; for example, it's not hard to show that there is no $(8,3,4)$-queue. Some special cases are straightforward.  An $(m,n,m)$-queue trivially exists; it consists of $m$ vertical paths of length $n$ (see the $(6,6,6)$-queue in the figure above.)  An $(m,n,1)$-queue always exists; the $(6,6,1)$-queue above illustrates a ubiquitous construction.  An $(m,n,n)$-queue always exists if $n\le m$; for example, here's the canonical construction of a $(6,4,4)$-queue: Constructing larger queues from smaller queues One easy way to extend a queue is to stack one queue on top of its reflection; thus the existence of an $(m,n,k)$-queue implies the existence of a $(m,cn,k)$-queue for any integer $c>0$. Here's a more interesting construction.  In an $(m,n,k)$-queue with $k|m$, there's a possibility that some horizontal line in the grid is crossed exactly $m/k$ times by each of the $k$ paths. (This happens, for example, in
the pictured $(6,6,2)$-queue; both paths intersect the line below the top line three times.)  In this case you can insert an extra row at this line, extending all $k$ paths vertically to get an $(m,n+1,k)$-queue: Iterating, this proves the existence of a $(6,n,2)$-queue for all $n\ge 6$.  (If you've been to the Haunted Mansion, this construction will look familiar!) You can also extend horizontally (if $k|n$ and every path intersects a vertical line $n/k$ times) to get an $(m+1,n,k)$-queue. Remarks The contiguousness requirement was motivated by observation of actual queues.  However, the problem seems trivial if that requirement is dropped; in that case, the necessary conditions $k|mn$ and $k\le m$ are also sufficient. Observe that there are some parity consequences of the bipartiteness of the grid.  If $l$ is odd, the paths connect points of the same color in a ""checkerboard"" coloring of the grid, otherwise paths connect points of opposite color.  If $mn$ is odd, then there's a ""majority color""; the line of entry points (and the line of exit points) must begin and end with that majority color. By connecting the first exit point to the second exit point, reversing direction and so on, the problem can be viewed as asking whether there is a Hamiltonian path in the grid with additional structure.  This led to some interesting references but no solution. There are plenty of related problems here, such as the problem of counting queues.  Some variant of the Gessel-Viennot lemma seems like it might be useful; this has been extended to graphs with cycles (e.g. here ) but the property that all paths have the same length is not preserved by tail-swapping, so there's room for innovation.","['combinatorial-geometry', 'hamiltonian-path', 'combinatorics']"
1394029,Infinite series of integrals of $L^2$ functions,"I'm hoping someone can help me with this integration problem I've been struggling with.

The assumptions of the problem lead me to believe that some sort of Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality result can be used, maybe along with Dominated Convergence Theorem. However, every attempt I've made at using CSI has led to unwanted square roots. I was, however, able to prove with Fatou's Lemma that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty |f_n|^2$ is integrable.

The only thing mentioned in my notes so far is in relation to finite-dimensional vector spaces, namely, that a vector space is finite-dimensional if it has a finite basis. My question(s): how is it exactly that one understands these spaces to be infinite-dimensional; what does it mean to say that they are infinite-dimensional and how do they differ from an example of a finite-dimensional vector space, say, $\mathbb R^n$. Going on what I know about finite-dimensional spaces, is it simply then that an infinite-dimensional space has an infinite basis? How would one visualize this?

1394191,Need help to understand Uniqueness of Lifts theorem's proof.,"Theorem: Let $p:E \to B$ be a covering map. Fix $b_0 \in B$ and $e_0 \in p^{-1}(b_0)$. Let $f: X \to B$ be a continuous map with $f(x_0)=b_0$ and $X$ is connected. Suppose $g_1,g_2: X \to E$ are two continuous maps such that $p \circ g_1= p \circ g_2 = f$ and $g_1(x_0)=g_2(x_0)=e_0$, Then $g_1=g_2$. For proving this theorem, my teacher first considered a set $S=\{x \in X |g_1(x)=g_2(x)\}$. The theme of proof was showing $S$ to be both open and closed in $X$ and then using connectedness of $X$ to show that $S=X$. Now, the part of proof I am not able to understand is proving that $S$ is open. It is as follows: Fix $x_1 \in X$ arbitrarily. Let $V_{f(x_1)}$ be any evenly covered neighbourhood of $f(x_1)$. Since $f$ is continuous, there exists a neighbourhood $W_1$ of $x_1$ such that $f(W_1) \subseteq V_{f(x_1)}$.
  Put $e_1=g_1(x_1)=g_2(x_1) \in E$. Let $U$ be the slice over $V_{f(x_1)}$ containing $e_1$.
  Since $g_1,g_2$ are continuous, there exist open neighbourhoods $W_2,W_3$ of $x_1$ in $X$ such that $g_1(W_2) \subseteq U$ & $g_2(W_3) \subseteq U$.
  Let $W_0=W_1 \cap W_2 \cap W_3$.
  Now, since $p \circ g_1 = p \circ g_2 = f$, therefore $f(x)=p(g_1(x))=p(g_2(x)) \forall x \in W_0$ where $g_1(x),g_2(x) \in U \forall x \in W_0$.
  But $p|U: U \to V_{f(x_1)}$ is a bijection $\Rightarrow g_1(x)=g_2(x) \forall x \in W_0$. Hence $W_0 \subseteq S \Rightarrow S$ is open. Last line of the proof i.e. getting $S$ to be open is clear to me. But how we get $g_1(x)=g_2(x) \forall x \in W_0$is not clear to me.","['algebraic-topology', 'general-topology', 'functions']"

Unfortunately in a set of lecture notes on (Lie) group representations (material for our study group) the author accidentally used here $\min$ instead of $\inf$. Probably a mostly harmless booboo, because at that point it was only needed to get a Banach space structure on the quotient, and we will probably be concentrating on Hilbert spaces anyway, where the problem does not arise. Namely from Rudin's Functional Analysis I could not find a proof that the minimum should always be attained. Except in the case of a Hilbert space, where an application of parallelogram law (the sum of the squared norms of the two diagonals of a parallelogram equals that of the four sides) allows us to find a Cauchy sequence among a sequence of vectors $(y_n)\subset x+F$ such that 
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left\Vert y_n\right\Vert_E=\left\Vert x+F\right\Vert_{E/F}.$$ But anyway, the suspicion was left that the infimum is there for a reason (other than conveniently allowing us to sweep this detail under the rug at that point of the development of theory), so in the interest of serving our study group I had to come up with a specific example, where the minimum is not achieved. It's been 25 years since I really had to exercise the Banach space gland in my brain, so it has shrunk to size of a raisin. Searching this site did help, because I found this question . There we have $E=C([0,1])$, the space of continuous real functions on $[0,1]$ equipped with the sup-norm. If we denote by $\Lambda$ the continuous functional

\Lambda: E\to\mathbb{R},f\mapsto\int_0^{1/2}f-\int_{1/2}^1f
$$
and let $F=\ker\Lambda$, then the answer to the linked question proves that there is no minimum sup-norm function in the coset $\Lambda^{-1}(1)$. So I have a (counter)example, and the main question has evolved to: When can we use minimum in place of infimum in the definition of the quotient space norm? My thinking: It seems to me that the answer is affirmative, if $F$ has a complement, i.e. we can write $E=F\oplus F'$ as a direct sum of two closed subspaces such that the norm on $E$ is
equivalent to the sum of the norms on $F$ and $F'$-components. But the first point also raises the suspicion that the question may be a bit ill-defined (and uninteresting) in the sense that the answer might depend on the choice of the norm $\left\Vert\cdot\right\Vert_E$ among the set of equivalent norms. However, if we, for example, perturb the sup-norm of $C([0,1])$ in the above example by multiplying the functions with a fixed positive definite function before taking the sup-norm, the argument seems to survive, so may be replacing the norm with an equivalent one is irrelevant? So to satisfy my curiosity I also welcome ""your favorite example"" (one with a finite-dimensional $F$ would be nice to see), where we absolutely need the infimum here. Bits about any sufficient or necessary conditions for the minimum to be sufficient or (as a last resort :-) pointers to relevant literature are, of course, also appreciated.","['quotient-spaces', 'banach-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'normed-spaces']"

1394422,Find two homeomorphic topological spaces and a bijective continuous map between them which is not homeomorphism.,"I'm aware that it is duplicate, but I'd like to know whether my example is appropriate or not. Let our function $f$ be on the set $\mathbb{Q}\cap\mathbb{Z}$ induced by standard topology of a line. I'm going to construct a bijection from $\mathbb{Q}\cap\left((0,1)\cup(1,2)\right)$ to $\mathbb{Q}\cap(0,1)$. The rest from $(2n,2n+1)\cup(2n+1,2n+2)$ to $(n,n+1)$ is similar. My idea is that if the restriction of $f$ on $(n,n+1)$ is monotonous then we are done, because $f$ becomes continuous but its inverse does not.
Let's denote elements from $(0,1)$ in domain as $\dfrac{a'}{b}$ and elements from $(1,2)$ in domain decrease by $1$ and denote as $\dfrac{a''}{b}$ .
$$f(\dfrac{1'}{2})=\dfrac{1}{2}\text{and}f(\dfrac{1''}{2})=\dfrac{1}{3}$$
$$f(\dfrac{1'}{3})=\dfrac{1}{4}\text{and}f(\dfrac{1''}{3})=\dfrac{1}{5}$$
$$f(\dfrac{2'}{3})=\dfrac{2}{3}\text{and}f(\dfrac{2''}{3})=\dfrac{3}{4}$$
$$f(\dfrac{1'}{4})=\dfrac{1}{6}\text{and}f(\dfrac{1''}{4})=\dfrac{1}{7}$$
$$...\text{so.on}...$$
So $f(x'')=y$ means $f(1+x)=y$ and $f(x')=f(x)$ The idea is next:
We start from the elements with smallest denominator and map them on element which satisfies the condition of monotone on the one hand, and has the smallest possible denominator on the other hand.

1394423,Conjugacy in $S_n$ with composing permutations left to right vs. right to left,"I realize there are two conventions for composing permutations. Left to right: $(1\ 2)(1\ 3) = (1\ 2\ 3)$ Right to left: $(1\ 2)(1\ 3) = (1\ 3\ 2)$ Among others, Dummit and Foote and Contemporary Abstract Algebra (Gallian) use the right to left convention, while Handbook of Computational Group Theory (Holt), Sage, and GAP use the left to right convention. Now, given permutations $\sigma, \tau \in S_n$ , where $\sigma = (\sigma_1\ \sigma_2 \ldots\ \sigma_n) \ldots$ (in cycle notation), in the right to left convention we have the convenient fact that $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1} = (\tau(\sigma_1)\ \tau(\sigma_2)\  \ldots\ \tau(\sigma_n) ) \ldots$ . Proof: Observe that if $\sigma(i) = j$ , then $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1} (\tau(i)) = \tau(j)$ . Therefore if the ordered pair $i, j$ appears in the cycle decomposition of $\sigma$ , then the ordered pair $\tau(i), \tau(j)$ appears in the cycle decomposition of $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1}$ . Now if you believe that, you can use a similar proof to obtain the ugly fact that in the left to right notation $\tau \sigma \tau^{-1} = (\tau^{-1}(\sigma_1)\ \tau^{-1}(\sigma_2) \ldots\ \tau^{-1}(\sigma_n))\ldots$ To me this makes the left to right convention inferior, because conjugation follows a less natural rule. Am I missing something? Are there other reasons to compose permutations from left to right that result in simpler algebraic laws? And if not, I am curious why we don't exclusively use right to left notation.","['convention', 'permutations', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'gap']"

(You actually get continuity for free, but I include it because it belongs there if you replace $\mathbb{R}^d$ with something infinite dimensional.)  In this case, I write $v^a\nabla _af(x):=\mathrm{D}_vf(x)$.

The result is true for the Fréchet derivative (see, e.g., Pugh pg. 281), but false for the Gâteaux derivative (see, e.g., the standard example on Wikipedia).  This is not a counter-example for the definition above because the second derivative fails to be linear at the origin (and so it is not considered to be twice differentiable there).  Furthermore, it is true for all three definitions if we require continuity of $\nabla _a\nabla _bf(x)$ at $x$.  But can we remove this continuity hypothesis?

But to use l'Hospital's and know the limit existed, it was sufficient to assume $f(x)$ was differentiable at $x = a$.

$$|a| + |b| \leq \sqrt{2} \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$ And the triangle inequality, $$|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$$ Expanding the numerator gives us $$\frac{2x^5 + 4x^3y^2 - 2xy^4}{(x^2 + y^2)^2}$$ For starters, I use the triangle inequality theorem to make the numerator look like this: $$|2x^5 + 4x^3y^2 - 2xy^4| \leq |2x^5|+|4x^3y^2|+|2xy^4|$$ Also, in regard to the denominator, since it is even, it is always positive and thus equal to its absolute value.

$$|2x^5|+|4x^3y^2|+|2xy^4| \leq 6|x^5+2x^3y^2+xy^4|$$ My question is, since $|a+b| \leq |a|+|b|$, I feel as though I cannot violate that rule and am stuck. What trick(s) can I use from here?

Notes: The latter index is the degree of the Gauss map $\partial B^n \to S^{n-1}$ defined by the vector field on the boundary of a small ball $B^n$ containing the zero, as in Poincaré-Hopf. I'm looking for an argument that is intrinsic or at least preserves the Riemannian structure, maybe using the Hessian. (Here's a sketch of my unsatisfying argument: Any two Riemannian structures on $M$ define gradient vector fields for $f$ with the same critical points, and you can define a time-dependent flow connecting any two such vector fields to see that the index of every zero is preserved. Thus it suffices to invoke the Morse lemma and use a Morse chart to pull back to $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard Riemannian metric.

s_1&1&0\\

\mathbb P\,(X_{n}=s_1\,|\,X_{n-1}=s_1)=&\,1,\\

Something similar appears to occur in the study of metric spaces. Each metric space $X$ is equipped with a ball bundle $BX$, defined as $(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \cup \{\infty\}) \times X.$ I'm not 100% sure how to make this into a metric space in its own right. Anyway, we get a projection $\pi_X : BX \rightarrow X$ given by $\pi_X(r,x) = x$. Given a function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ between metric spaces, we get a pushforward $f_* : BX \rightarrow BY$ that works as follows: we assert that $(s,y)$ equals $f_*(r,x)$ iff two conditions hold. Firstly, $y = f(x).$ Secondly, $s$ equals the least element of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \cup \{\infty\}$ such that closed the ball of radius $s$ centered at $y$ includes the image under $f$ of the closed ball of radius $r$ centered at $x$. I'm not sure if we need any conditions on $f$ to ensure that such an $s$ exists. So whereas the pushforward in differential geometry measures the directed sensitivity of the function to an infinitesimal directed change, the pushforward of a function between metric spaces (as defined above) measures the undirected sensitivity to an undirected error. Anyway, it seems to me that these ball bundles provide a sensible foundation for the basic numerical analysis we're learning in class at the moment. For example, this construction generalizes and improves upon the notion of interval arithmetic . Question. Is anyone talking about ""ball bundles"" of metric spaces?

LEMMA. ( Generalized Jensen's inequality ) Let $(\Omega, \mathscr{F}, \mathbf{P})$ be a probability space, $X$ an integrable random variable on this space, and $\mathscr{G}$ a sub-$\sigma$-field of $\mathscr{F}$. We shall denote by $Y$ a version of $\mathbf{E}[X\mid \mathscr{G}]$. Let $f$ be a measurable mapping of $\Omega \times \mathbf{R}$ (with the natural product $\sigma$-field) into $\mathbf{R}$, such that (a) The mapping $\omega \mapsto f(\omega,t)$ is $\mathscr{G}$-measurable for each $t\in\mathbf{R}$. (b) The mapping $t\mapsto f(\omega,t)$ is convex for each $\omega \in \Omega$. Suppose that the random variable $\omega \mapsto f(\omega,X(\omega))$ is integrable. We then have the inequality
  $$\mathbf{E}[f(\cdot,X(\cdot))\mid \mathscr{G}] \geq f(\cdot,Y(\cdot))\ \text{a.s.}$$ He indicates that one could prove the theorem for simple $X$ and then pass to a limit ""which is a little more delicate than usual"" and then omits the proof. As a side note, I have searched Dubins' paper and find nothing even remotely similar in it. I don't see how assuming $X$ is simple would help, but here's what I've tried so far. Proof. By the convexity assumption, for all $x,x_0,\omega$ we have
$$
f(\omega,x) \geq \partial_2 f(\omega,x_0)(x-x_0) + f(\omega,x_0)
$$
where
$$
\partial_2 f(\omega,x_0) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(\omega,x_0+1/n)-f(\omega,x_0)}{1/n}
$$
is the right-handed derivative in $f$'s second variable. Note that $\partial_2 f(\cdot,x_0)$ is a limit of $\mathscr{G}$-measurable functions and hence is as well, for each $x_0$. Now plug in $x=X(\omega)$, so we have
$$
f(\omega,X(\omega)) \geq \partial_2 f(\omega,x_0)(X(\omega)-x_0) + f(\omega,x_0)
$$
for all $x_0$. At this point I would like to condition both sides relative to $\mathscr{G}$ to get
$$
\mathbf{E}[f(\cdot,X(\cdot))\mid \mathscr{G}](\omega) \geq \partial_2 f(\omega,x_0)(Y(\omega)-x_0) + f(\omega,x_0)
$$
for almost all $\omega$ in $\Omega_{x_0}$ with $\mathbf{P}(\Omega_{x_0})=1$, and hence for all $\omega \in \Omega^*$ where $\Omega^* = \cap_{q \in \mathbf{Q}} \Omega_{x_0}$ has full measure. Then for all $\omega \in \Omega^*$ I can take a sequence $q_n \searrow Y(\omega)$ to obtain
$$
\mathbf{E}[f(\cdot,X(\cdot))\mid \mathscr{G}](\omega) \geq f(\omega,Y(\omega))
$$
where here we make use of the local boundedness of $x_0 \mapsto \partial_2 f(\omega,x_0)$ given to us by convexity, and the continuity of $x_0 \mapsto f(\omega,x_0)$ also given to us by convexity. I said like up in bold because I do not know that $\omega \mapsto \partial_2 f(\omega, x_0)X(\omega), \omega\mapsto \partial_2 f(\omega,x_0)$, and $\omega \mapsto f(\omega, x_0)$ are integrable, so I cannot just pull out the $\mathscr{G}$-measurable parts. Is there some way I can resolve this? EDIT: It may be useful to note that $f$ is actually $\mathscr{G}\otimes \mathscr{B}(\mathbf{R})$-measurable: define $f_n(\omega,x) := f(\omega, d_n(x))$ where $d_n(x) = \inf\{ \frac{k}{2^n} : \frac{k}{2^n} \geq x, k \in \mathbf{Z}\}$. Then $\{ f_n \in B \} = \cup_{\frac{k}{2^n}, k \in \mathbb{Z}}( \{\omega:f(\omega,\frac{k}{2^n}) \in B\} \times [\frac{k}{2^n},\frac{k+1}{2^n}))$.

1395251,"Proof of onto and one-to-one functions, composition","I want to prove this: Let $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C $ be functions. if $g \circ f$ is onto, and $g$ is one-to-one, then f is onto. Here is what I have done, can someone please verify my work: Let $y \in B$. And let $z = g(y) \in C$. Since $g \circ f$ is onto, there exists an $x \in A$ such that $g \circ f(x) = z$. So, we have, $g(f(x)) = z$. We also have, $g(y)=z$, hence $g(f(x)) = g(y)$. Since $g$ is one-to-one, we conclude that $f(x)=y$. Therefore, shown that for any $y \in B$, there is an $x \in A$ such that $f(x) = y$. Therefore, $f$ is onto.","['function-and-relation-composition', 'discrete-mathematics', 'functions']"

1395269,Average order of $\mathrm{rad}(n)$,"Let $\mathrm{rad}(n)$ denote the radical of an integer $n$, which is the product of the distinct prime numbers dividing n. Or equivalently, $$\mathrm{rad}(n)=\prod_{\scriptstyle p\mid n\atop p\text{ prime}}p.$$ Assume $\mathrm{rad}(1)=1$, so that $\mathrm{rad}(n)$ is multiplicative. I was wondering if one has a nice asymptotic formula for the sum $$\sum_{n\le x}\mathrm{rad}(n).$$
At first, I wanted to use the Wiener-Ikehara Theorem. Using Euler Product, we have 
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
R(s)&=\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{\mathrm{rad}(n)}{n^s}=\prod_{p}(1+\frac{p}{p^s}+\frac{p}{p^{2s}}+\cdots)\\
&=\prod_{p}(1+\frac{p}{p^s}\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}})\\
&=\zeta(s)\prod_{p}(1+\frac{p-1}{p^s}).
\end{split}
\end{align}
However, the Wiener-Ikehara Theorem seems not to work here because the product part diverges when $s=1.$ Comparing term-wisely with the product and using $1<p-1<p$, we can get
$$\frac{\zeta(s)^2}{\zeta(2s)}<R(s)<\frac{\zeta(s)\zeta(s-1)}{\zeta(2s-2)}.$$ Moreover, if multiplicative function $\mathrm{core}(n)$ is defined to map positive integers ''n'' to square-free numbers by reducing the
exponents in the prime power representation modulo 2, or in formula 
: $$\mathrm{core}(p^e) = p^{e\mod 2}.$$ with $\mathrm{core}(1) =1 .$ Or equivalently, $$\mathrm{core}(p^{2k+1})=p,$$ $$\mathrm{core}(p^{2k})=1$$
Then we always have $$\mathrm{core}(n) \le \mathrm{rad}(n).$$
Since the Dirichlet generating function of $\mathrm{core}$ is
: 
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
C(s)&=\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{\mathrm{core}(n)}{n^s}
=\prod_{p}(1+\frac{p}{p^s}+\frac{1}{p^{2s}}+\frac{p}{p^{3s}}+\frac{1}{p^{4s}}+\cdots)\\
&=\prod_{p}(1+\frac{\frac{p}{p^s}+\frac{1}{p^{2s}}}{1-\frac{1}{p^{2s}}})\\
&=\frac{\zeta(2s)\zeta(s-1)}{\zeta(2s-2)}.
\end{split}
\end{align} $$\frac{\zeta(2s)\zeta(s-1)}{\zeta(2s-2)}<R(s)<\frac{\zeta(s)\zeta(s-1)}{\zeta(2s-2)}$$
Here we may use the Wiener-Ikehara Theorem to derive asymptotic bounds. This was as far as I could work out.

1395359,Degree of a projective variety,"Let $X \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ be a projective variety of dimension $k <n$.

In other words, the general $(n-k-1)$-plane does not meet $X$. Question 1: How can we show that there exists an open set of $G(n-k,n)$, such that every $(n-k)$-plane in that open set meets $X$ in zero dimension? Question 2: Taking a step further, how can we show that the number of points that the general $(n-k)$-plane (of Question 1) meets $X$ is constant? This is known as the degree of $X$. PS: I am interested in arguments making use of basic principles rather than invoking results from intersection theory. I am aware that if we intersect $X$ with an $(n-1)$-plane that meets $X$ but does not contain it, then the dimension of the intersection is precisely $k-1$. Now, an $(n-k)$-plane is the intersection of $k$ $(n-1)$-planes and so i can intuitively see the existence of the required open set of Question 1. But how to establish this rigorously?

Explain. d) How many elements of $f \in F$ are there so that $fRI$ A and $f$ is onto? Explain. My attempt to answer: a) We know a relation $R$ is reflexive iff for all $x\in A$, $xRx$ We know a relation $R$ is symmetric iff for all $x1, x2\in A$, if $x1Rx2$ then $x2Rx1$ We know a relation $R$ is transitive iff for all $x, y, z\in A$, if $xRy$ and $yRz$ then $xRz$ Now, using these definitions, we should be able to answer a). $R$ is reflexive: Let $f\in F$. Then $f(1)\leq f(1)$, so $fRf$. If $n=1$ then $F$ contains exactly one element and it is obvious that in that case $R$ is symmetric and transitive. This as a consequence of the fact that it is reflexive. So let us assume that $n>1$ from here. $R$ is not symmetric: Let $f\in F$ be prescribed by $i\mapsto1$ and $g\in F$ by $i\mapsto2$. Then $fRg$ but not $gRf$. $R$ is not transitive: Let $f,g,h\in F$ with $f(1)=f(2)=2$, $g(1)=2\wedge g(2)=1$ and $h(1)=h(2)=1$. Then $fRg\wedge gRh$ but not $fRh$. Now b) We know that Identity function returns the same values as its parameter, right? So, if you pass f(1) = 2, then identity function of f I A (2) = 1 so the question is how many elements $f \in F$ are there so that $fRI$ A ?
