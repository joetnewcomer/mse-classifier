478389,What algorithm is a good to search a lotto design?,"I'm interested what kind of algorithm would be suitable to find a lotto design? I saw that is has been proven that $L(39,7,4,7)=329$. This notation is explained in http://web.archive.org/web/20070824014211/http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/csgnotes/LottoDesigns.pdf and it goes as follows: In a lotto, one chooses seven distinct numbers $n_1<\ldots < n_7$ from the set $\{1,\ldots,39\}$ and forms a tuple $(n_1,\ldots,n_7)$ called row. It is possible to choose 329 of such rows such that for any arbitrary row $(n_1,\ldots,n_7),$ the set of those 329 rows contains at least one row $(m_1,\ldots,m_7)$ such that $$|\{n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4,n_5,n_6,n_7\}\cap \{m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4,m_5,m_6,m_7\}|\geq 4?$$
I think this result is due to Hämäläinen based on the inequality $$L(39,7,4,7) \leq L(16,7,4,4) + L(23,7,4,4)\leq 76+253=329$$ that I'm not familiar. Now the question: Is it possible to list those $329$ rows from the design $(39,7,4,7)$ explicitly with reasonable time? Is simulated annealing the best algorithm to list those rows? I asked this on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18486523/what-algorithm-is-a-good-to-search-a-lotto-design but it turned out a bad question there.","['combinatorial-designs', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics']"
478397,Components of a closed set are closed,"Prove that the components of a closed set $E$ are closed. For each point $a$, let $C(a)$ be the component containing $a$. Then $C(a)$ is the union of all connected sets containing $a$. We must prove that $C(a)$ is closed. We have $a\in C(a)\subseteq E$. Since $C(a)$ is connected, we have that its closure $\overline{C(a)}$ is also connected. Also, $\overline{C(a)}\subseteq\overline{E}=E$ since $E$ is closed. So we have $a\in C(a)\subseteq \overline{C(a)}\subseteq\overline{E}$. We must prove that $C(a)=\overline{C(a)}$. How?","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"
478422,"Prove that if 33 rooks are placed on a chessboard, at least five don't attack one another","The question asks to prove that when 33 rooks are placed on an $8 \times 8$ chessboard that there are a total of 5 rooks that aren't attacking each other. What I know: 64 squares Rooks attack in straight lines at least 1 row must have more than 5 rooks at least 1 column must have more than 5 rooks I've set up an empty chessboard and randomly picked a row and place 5 and a column that contained five and found that no matter where you place them 1 X-shaped diagonal will have four rooks in it. So i counted all the holes that would have to have a rook placed in it to complete the diagonal of 5 and came up with 12. I just don't know how to use that. I understand that concept that it works via diagonals and that 32 is the max number you can place on a chessboard with only having 4 in each diagonal. The minute you place the 33 one you make atleast one diaganol have 5 in it. Making it so that 5 aren't attacking each other. But I don't know how to write that into the form of a proof. The proffesor said to use the pigeonhole principle, but I'm not sure what is the pigeon and what is the hole.","['pigeonhole-principle', 'discrete-mathematics']"

478470,"Is the zero matrix the only symmetric, nilpotent matrix with real values?","My intuition tells me that the zero matrix is the only matrix that is symmetric and nilpotent with real values, but I'm having trouble proving it (or finding a counterexample.) I have searched for related problems, but I've found only one where nilpotent was defined as any matrix $A$ where $A^2=0$; using this definition, the problem is pretty easy.  I'm using the more general definition that $A$ is nilpotent if and only if there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $A^k=0$. Based on my observations while trying to find a counterexample, I've been trying to formulate some argument about the positive semi-definiteness of the entries on the main diagonal, but I'm not getting very far with it.  Is this the right approach?  Is my gut feeling even true?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
478480,Isomorphism of quotients of powers of maximal ideals,"Let $R$ be an integral domain, and $\mathfrak{m}$ a maximal ideal of $R$.  Let $R_\mathfrak{m}$ denote the ring localized at $\mathfrak{m}$, and let $\mathfrak{m}_\mathfrak{m} = \mathfrak{m}R_\mathfrak{m}$ denote the maximal ideal of $R_\mathfrak{m}$. Then we have an isomorphism $$R/\mathfrak{m}^n \cong R_\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}_\mathfrak{m}^n,$$ for $n \geq 1$.  (See for example Neukirch, Algebraic Number Theory , pg. 66). My question: Can this result extend to an isomorphism
$$\mathfrak{m}^k/\mathfrak{m}^n \cong \mathfrak{m}_\mathfrak{m}^k/\mathfrak{m}_\mathfrak{m}^n,$$

It would seem the proof goes through, but I wanted to check with the experts, since I hadn't seen this result explicitly written down before. 2nd question (added later): Is the ""integral domain"" condition really necessary to either Neukirch's result or the other one I suggested?","['commutative-algebra', 'ideals', 'abstract-algebra']"

478534,"Two questions regarding $\mathrm {Li}$ from ""Edwards""","I would appreciate help understanding a relation in Edwards's ""Riemann's Zeta Function."" On page 30 he has: $$\int_{C^{+}} \frac{t^{\beta - 1}}{\log t}dt = \int_{0}^{x^{\beta}}\frac{du}{\log u}= \mathrm {Li} (x^{\beta}) - i\pi$$ He states for $\beta$ positive and real, change variables $u = t^{\beta}$ which implies $\log t = \log u/\beta$ and $dt/t = du/u \beta$. Here $C^{+}$ is a path which is a line segment from $0$ to $1 - \epsilon$ and passes over the singularity at $u = 1$ in a semi-circle in the upper half-plane and continues in a line segment from $1 + \epsilon$ to $1$. I would appreciate help with two aspects: -- Since most of the discussions of the logarithmic integral I have seen take the integral from $2$ rather than from $0$, how do you treat what looks like a $- \mathrm {Li}(0)$ term? -- How do you actually get the $- i \pi$ term. I would guess it's from integrating around the half-circle above $u = 1$ in a clockwise direction. But I have tried parametrization with $u = r e^{i \theta}$.

478541,Find the number of zeroes of the polynomial $h(z)=z^{5} + 5z^{3} + 2z^{2} + 4z + 1$ in the right half-plane.,"Question: Find the number of zeroes of the polynomial $h(z)=z^{5}+5z^{3}+2z^{2}+4z+1$ in the right half-plane. Comments: There may be a number of ways to arrive at a solution to this problem, but it would be instructive for me to know if anyone can solve it using Rouché's theorem (or the principle of the argument if that proves impossible). My idea is to count the zeros on an area bounded by the imaginary axis and a half-circle $C$ on the right half-plane with center in $z=0$ and of radius $R$ where $R$ is a large enough number to contain all the zeros in the right-half plane. To do so using Rouché, I would need to see if there is a $g(z)$ which has an absolute value larger than $|f(z)-g(z)|$ on the boundary (that is, on the imaginary axis and on $C$). I am unsure however which $g(z)$ to choose. This is a problem from an old complex analysis exam, it is similar to this problem which I posted earlier. All input appreciated.",['complex-analysis']
478562,Proving a well-known formula regarding adj(A),"The adjugate of a matrix $A$ is defined as
$$
(\mathrm{adj}(A))_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j}M_{ji}(A)
$$
where $M_{ji}(A)$ is the determinant of the matrix $A$ after row $j$ and column $i$ have been removed. It is well-known that
$$
A\,\mathrm{adj}(A) = \mathrm{adj}(A)A = \det(A) I
$$
Therefore, if $A$ is invertible, we get the famous formula $A^{-1} = \det(A)^{-1}\mathrm{adj}(A)$. There is also a well-known expansion of $A$ using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, that looks like this:
$$
p_0 I + p_1 A + p_2 A^2 + \dots + p_n A^n = 0
$$
where the $p_i$ are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of $A$.
I have seen it written in many places (wikipedia, planetmath, textbooks) that the following also holds:
$$
\mathrm{adj}(A) = -(p_1 I + p_2 A + \dots + p_n A^{n-1})
$$
where the $p_i$ are the same as in the previous equation. It is easy to prove this formula in the case where $A$ is invertible by applying the identities given above together with the fact that $p_0 = \det(A)$. However, I think the adjugate expansion still holds when $A$ is not invertible... how do I prove it for such a case?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
478566,Is it possible to put $+$ or $-$ signs in such a way that $\pm 1 \pm 2 \pm \cdots \pm 100 = 101$?,"I'm reading a book about combinatorics. Even though the book is about combinatorics there is a problem in the book that I can think of no solutions to it except by using number theory. Problem: Is it possible to put $+$ or $-$ signs in such a way that $\pm 1 \pm 2 \pm \cdots  \pm 100 = 101$? My proof is kinda simple. Let's work in mod $2$. We'll have: $\pm 1 \pm 2 \pm \cdots  \pm 100 \equiv 101 \mod 2$
but since $+1 \equiv -1 \mod 2$ and there are exactly $50$ odd numbers and $50$ even numbers from $1$ to $100$  we can write: $(1 + 0 + \cdots + 1 + 0 \equiv 50\times 1 \equiv 0) \not\equiv (101\equiv 1) \mod 2$ which is contradictory. Therefore, it's not possible to choose $+$ or $-$ signs in any way to make them equal. Now is there a combinatorial proof of that fact except what I have in mind?",['combinatorics']
478588,Combinatorial total space for finitely generated torsion-free groups?,"Motivation : I'm an operator algebraist and I'm looking for an answer to the main question in order to build non-trivial spectral triples for a class (as large as possible) of discrete groups. $\to$ It's noncommutative geometry ""à la Alain Connes"". Definition : Let $G$ be a group, then a total space for $G$ is a weakly contractible topological space $X$ (i.e., every homotopy groups $\pi_{n}(X)$ are trivial), together with a free action of $G$ (i.e, $\forall x \in X$ and $\forall g \in G$ , if $g.x = x$ then $g = e$ ). It is generally noted $EG$ . Definition : A group $\Gamma$ is finitely generated if there is a finite generating subset $S \subset \Gamma $ . In general such groups can be defined by generators $S$ and  relations $R$ , as $\Gamma := \langle S \hspace{0.1cm} \vert \hspace{0.1cm} R \rangle$ . The pair $(\Gamma , S)$ is called a marked group . Definition : Let $(\Gamma , S)$ be a marked group with $|S| < \infty$ (i.e. finitely generated), $S=S^{-1}$ and identity $e \not \in S$ . Let $\Gamma_{n}$ be the sets of irreducible $n$ -blocks , defined by induction as follows: $\Gamma_{0} := \Gamma$ , $\Gamma_{1}:=\{ \{ g ,gs \}  \hspace{0.1cm}   \vert \hspace{0.1cm}    g \in \Gamma, s \in S  \}$ , for $n \geq 2$ , a $n$ -block is a nonempty finite set $\mathfrak{a}$ of irreducible $(n-1)$ -blocks such that $$ \forall \mathfrak{b} \in \mathfrak{a}, \forall \mathfrak{c} \in \mathfrak{b}, \exists ! \mathfrak{b}'\in \mathfrak{a}  \text{ such that }  \mathfrak{b} \cap \mathfrak{b}' = \{\mathfrak{c}\};$$ it is called irreducible if for all $n$ -blocks $ \mathfrak{a}_1$ and $\mathfrak{a}_2$ $$ \mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{a}_1 \triangle \mathfrak{a}_2 := (\mathfrak{a}_1 \cup \mathfrak{a}_2) \backslash \mathfrak{a}_1 \cap \mathfrak{a}_2 \Rightarrow  max(\vert \mathfrak{a}_1 \vert ,\vert \mathfrak{a}_2\vert) \ge \vert \mathfrak{a}\vert. $$ Geometric realization : Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated marked group, and let $\Gamma_{n}$ its set of irreducible $n$ -blocks. Its geometric realization $X$ is the topological space built by induction : Each element $\mathfrak{a}$ of $\Gamma_{n}$ is related to a $n$ -polytope $r(\mathfrak{a}) \subset X$ as follows : $\mathfrak{a} \in \Gamma_{0}$ is related to a  vertex. $\mathfrak{a} \in \Gamma_{1}$ is related to an edge. $\mathfrak{a} \in \Gamma_{2}$ is related to the regular polygon with $\vert \mathfrak{a} \vert$ edges. $\mathfrak{a} \in \Gamma_{n+1}$ is related to the $(n+1)$ -polytope, obtained  as the (n+1)-dimensional filling of the gluing of the $\vert \mathfrak{a} \vert$ $n$ -polytopes related to the elements of $\mathfrak{a}$ , such that $\forall \mathfrak{b}, \mathfrak{b}' \in \mathfrak{a}$ then: $r(\mathfrak{b} \cap \mathfrak{b}') = r(\mathfrak{b}) \cap  r(\mathfrak{b}')$ . Definition : Let $X_{n}$ be the regular CW complex obtained by gluing together all these $m$ -polytopes $\forall m \leq n$ such that $\forall \mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{a}' \in \Gamma_{m}$ then $r(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{a}') = r(\mathfrak{a}) \cap  r(\mathfrak{a}')$ . Note that the Cayley graph is $X_{1}$ , and the Cayley complex is ""close"" to $X_{2}$ . Each $X_{n}$ admits a natural distance $d_{n}$ , and $X_{n-1}$ naturally embeds into $X_{n}$ . Definition : Let $d$ be the distance on $ \bigcup{X_{n}}$ , defined as follows : $d(x,y) = \lim_{n \to \infty} d_{n}(x,y)$ . Remark : There is a small abuse in the previous definition because $d_{n}(x,y)$ is defined only for $x, y \in X_{n}$ . But because we take $n \to \infty$ , there is no problem. Definition : Let $X:=\overline{\bigcup{X_{n}}}$ , the complete metric space obtained as a completion of $\bigcup{X_{n}}$ for $d$ . We call it the total Cayley space of the pair $(\Gamma, S)$ . Main question : Is the total Cayley space $X$ of a finitely generated marked group $(\Gamma, S)$ , a total space $E \Gamma$ , for $\Gamma$ torsion-free ? Dimension : if $\Gamma_{n} \neq \emptyset$ and $\Gamma_{n+1}  = \emptyset $ , then $X$ is an $n$ -dimensional topological space and $X \simeq X_{n}$ . if $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ then $\Gamma_{n} \neq \emptyset$ , then $X$ is an $\infty$ -dimensional topological space. $\to$ The Thompson group $F$ (see B. Steinberg comment below). Sketch of proof ( it needs to be completed ) Finite dimensional case: The natural action of $\Gamma$ on $X$ is free . Let $x \in X$ and $g \in G$ such that $g.x = x$ , then $\exists n \geq 0$ and $\mathfrak{a} \in \Gamma_{n}$ such that $x \in r(\mathfrak{a})$ and $g.\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{a}$ . So a finite subset of $\Gamma$ is stable under the left multiplication by $g$ , then $g$ is torsion, so $g=e$ by assumption. $\square$ $X$ is weakly contractible : By construction, an embedding of a sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ is homotopic to the border of the realization $r(\mathfrak{a})$ of an irreducible $n$ -block $\mathfrak{a}$ . Now $r(\mathfrak{a})$ is a polytope, so it's homotopic to a point,  its border also. $\square$ $\infty$ -dimensional case: The natural action of $\Gamma$ on $X$ is free (inspired by Andreas Thom) : Let $x \in X$ and $g \in G$ such that $g.x = x$ . Now, $x = [(x_{n})]_{\sim}$ and $g.x = [(g.x_{n})]_{\sim}$ , so $d_{n}(x_{n},g.x_{n}) \to 0$ . Let $n$ with $d_{n}(x_{n},g.x_{n})$ sufficiently small , and let $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{a'}\in \Gamma_{n}$ such that $x_{n} \in r(\mathfrak{a})$ and $g.x_{n} \in r(\mathfrak{a'})$ . By construction, $r(\mathfrak{a}) \cap r(\mathfrak{a'}) \ne \emptyset$ and $\exists r \le n$ , $\mathfrak{b} \in \Gamma_{r}$ such that $r(\mathfrak{b}) \subset r(\mathfrak{a}) \cap r(\mathfrak{a'})$ and $g.\mathfrak{b} = \mathfrak{b}$ . The result follows as previously. $\square$ $X$ is weakly contractible ? See the generalized post here . In the literature $E \Gamma$ is well known as the universal covering of the classifying space $B \Gamma$ , which is (in the discrete groups case) the Eilenberg-MacLane space $K(\Gamma , 1)$ . There is also the Milnor construction . The construction here, specific to finitely generated groups, is very combinatorial . Question : Is there a good reference containing  this combinatorial construction ?","['noncommutative-geometry', 'geometric-group-theory', 'operator-algebras', 'metric-spaces', 'group-theory']"

I'm with the same kind of doubts in the first paragraph. I understood that $F^T$ is the polynomial after the change of coordinates, but I didn't understand what is $T^{-1}(V)$, is it  just a notation or is the pre-image of $V$? I'm trying to found a concrete example of $V, I^T, V^T$: Let $F\in k[X_1,X_2]$, (in this example $k=\mathbb R$) given by $F=X_1^2+X_2^2-1$ and the change of coordinates be given by $T(X_1,X_2)=(2X_1,2X_2)$, then we have: $F^T=4X_1^2+4X^2_2-1$ and in our example, $V=V(F)$, then $I^T$ is the ideal generated by $\{F^T=4X_1^2+4X^2_2-1\}$, since $I=I(V)=I(V(F))=F$, by definition. Then $V(I^T)$ is the points which vanish $F^T$, so $V(I^T)$ is the circle around the origin with radius $1/2$.

However I am completely stumped when it comes to finding $\gamma_1$.
The one thought I've had is that whatever $\gamma_1$ is, it cannot be a curve that partitions $K$ into two connected spaces, for then each side doesn't interact and for each side we'd be trying to retract a compact connected manifold onto its boundary, which is not possible. Some hints or advice would be greatly appreciated.","['general-topology', 'mobius-band', 'klein-bottle', 'algebraic-topology']"

Claim $[s_1 \dots s_n, z_1 \dots z_m] \in \left<[S,S] \right>$, for $s_1, \dots, s_n, z_1, \dots, z_m \in S$. First, show that $[s_1, \dots, s_n, z] \in \left<[S,S]\right>$, where $s_1, \dots, s_n, z \in S$. To do this, use induction on $n$. The case for $n=1$ is trivial. For $n >1$, 
\begin{align*}
[s_1 \dots s_n, z] =& (s_1\dots s_n)^{-1} z^{-1} s_1 \dots s_n z \\

By induction hypothesis, $[s_1 \dots s_{n-1}, z], [s_n,z] \in \left<[S,S]\right>$. Not sure how to complete this here, so let's just move on for now and pretend that $[s_1 \dots s_{n-1}, z]^{s_n} \in \left<[S,S]\right>$ by some miracle.

478999,Is this proof correct? (left inverse and topologically complementary subsets),"I want to prove the following theorem: Theorem . Assume $T \in \mathcal L ( X, Y )$ is injective. The following statements are equivalent: $T$ admits a left inverse; Im($T$) is closed and admits a complement in $Y$. Notation. $\mathcal L(X,Y)$ is the space of all continuous linear transformation from $X$ to $Y$. Im($T$) is the image (or the range ) of $T$. Ker($T$) shall denote the kernel of $T$. When $M$ and $N$, closed linear subset of a Banach space $X$, are complentary we write $X = M \bigoplus N$. It is a well known theorem (for example, is the theorem 2.13 of Brezis's book on functional analysis) and should be simple to prove, but all proofs I saw seem to be too concise, therefore some doubts hold on correctness of my try. Let's recall a Lemma (for example, Lemma 4.47 in Rynne and Youngson) Lemma. Suppose $X$ is a Banach space, $Y$ is a normed space and $T \in \mathcal L (X, Y)$. If there exists $\alpha > 0$ such that $\lVert Tx \rVert \geq \alpha \lVert x \rVert$ for all $x \in X$, then Im($T$) is closed. and the characterization of topological complementarity: Lemma. Assume $M$ is a closed linear subspace of a Banach space $X$. $M$ admits a complement in $X$ iff there exits $P \in \mathcal L(X)$ projection such that Im($P$) = $M$. and finally (Lemma 5.61(b) in Rynne and Youngson) Lemma. Suppose that $P$ is a projection on $X$. Then the subspaces Im($P$), Im($I-P$) are complementary. So here my try. Proof . (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2). Let $R\in \mathcal L(Y,X)$ the left inverse of $T$. So $RT = Id_X$ and $\lVert x \rVert = \lVert RT x \rVert \leq \lVert R \rVert \lVert Tx \rVert$. Hence $\lVert Tx \rVert \geq \alpha \lVert x \rVert$, $\alpha = \lVert R \rVert^{-1}$ (that is finite because $R$ is bounded) and Im($T$) is closed. Let $P = TR$; then $P$ is a projection and Im($P$) = Im($T$). Furthermore, Im($I - P$) is a complement of Im($P$) and Im($I - P$) = Ker($P$) = Ker($TR$) = Ker($R$) (because $T$ is injective). [ Is it correct? ] (2) $\Rightarrow$ (1). Assume that Im($T$) is closed and admits a complement, $N$, in $Y$. Then exists $P \in \mathcal L(Y)$, $P^2 = P$ such that Im($P$) = Im($T$). Since $Py \in$ Im($T$), there exists a unique $x \in X$ such that $T x = Py$. Set $Ry = x$. So $RT = Id_X$ and $R$ is continuous by theorem of inverse operator. The second part is the same as Brezis's one but the first part is different. He only says that it is an obvious fact that Im($T$) is closed. So my questions are: Why does he state that it is so obvious? Which is the quickest way to verify that an operator has closed image? Are there other possible complements? Sorry for such a long question, but since notations are not universal in this subject I preferred to be explicit. Thank you. References: H.

479192,Squaring rectangles,"it is a nice high-school exercise to prove that a square can be tiled with n squares if and only if n=1, 4 or is any integer greater or equal to 6. A direct consequence is that any rectangle that can be tiled with n squares can be tiled as well with n+3 squares and any number of squares that is greater or equal to n+5. A result of Dehn (not trivial) asserts that a rectangle can be tiled with finitely many squares if and only if it has integer lengths. Let R be such a rectangle and let m denote the least number of squares needed for a tiling of R. As we have already seen, R can be tiled with m+3 squares and any number greater or equal to m+5. Then there can be at most 6 classes of rectangles : those that cannot be tiled with any other number of squares, those that can be tiled with m+1 and m+4 squares, those that can be tiled with m+2 squares, those that can be tiled with m+1, m+2 and m+4 squares, those that can be tiled with m+2 and m+4 squares, those that can be tiled with m+4 squares. It seems that any of these classes is not empty. However, it is not so easy to compute the class of a given rectangle (at least for me!).

I feel that the first class contains all rectangles whose lengths are of the form (1,n) ; (2,2n+1) and (3,3n+2) and I don't know if there are others. Is it possible to determine all the rectangles of a class, or at least some subclasses in it?

The ratios $z_1:z_2\neq 0:0$ are the points of the complex projective line, and the two equations above identify the group of linear transformations with the one-dimensional projective group over the complex numbers, usually denoted by $P(1,\mathbb{C})$ . What is meant by the complex projective line here? What about the one-dimensional projective group over the complex numbers? Isn't this transformation just taking the set of extended plane (i.e. all complex numbers, union with infinity) onto itself?",['complex-analysis']

479377,Linear fractional transformation fixing origin and preserving all distances,"Prove that the most general transformation which leaves the origin fixed and preserves all distances is either a rotation or a rotation followed by reflection in the real axis. We represent a (linear fractional) transformation by $f(z)=\dfrac{az+b}{cz+d}$ for some complex constants $a,b,c,d$ with $ad-bc\neq 0$. Since the origin is fixed, we have $0=f(0)=\dfrac{b}{d}$, so that $b=0$, and $f(z)=\dfrac{az}{cz+d}$. Now, the transformation preserves all distances. So $$|z_1-z_2|=|f(z_1)-f(z_2)|=\left|\dfrac{az_1}{cz_1+d}-\dfrac{az_2}{cz_2+d}\right| = \frac{|a||d||z_1-z_2|}{|cz_1+d||cz_2+d|}$$ for all complex values $z_1,z_2$, so that $|cz_1+d||cz_2+d|=|ad|$. Since this holds for all $z_1,z_2$, we have that $|cz+d|$ must be constant, and that constant is equal to $\sqrt{|ad|}$. Also, when $z_0$, $|cz+d|=|d|$. So $\sqrt{|ad|}=|d|$ implies $|a|=|d|$.

I have defined $df$ for a differentiable function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ in the following naive but intuitive way and he has happily accepted this definition: $\large \displaystyle df = \lim_{\Delta{x} \to 0} \Delta{y}$ where $\large \Delta{y} = f'(x)\Delta{x} + \epsilon(\Delta{x})\Delta{x}$ and  $\large \epsilon(\Delta{x})$ is a function of $\large \Delta{x}$ that compensates the error for turning $\large f'(x) = \displaystyle \lim_{\Delta{x} \to 0}\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}}$ into an equality and by definition we have $\large \displaystyle \lim_{\Delta{x} \to 0}\epsilon(\Delta{x}) = 0$ Using that definition, I convinced him why the differential of a multivariable function is generalized to higher dimensions that way. But I failed to convince him why it's not a good idea to cancel $\partial{x_i}$ in the denominator with $dx_i$ just like we're dealing with fractions. I'm also afraid of proving the chain rule for him by dividing $\Delta{t}$ and then letting $\Delta{t} \to 0$.

479535,Orbits of affine group scheme actions,"Motivation Let $F$ and $K$ be distinct algebraically closed fields.  Then $GL_n(F)$ acts on $M_n(F)$ by conjugation, and the nilpotent orbits of this action can be characterized by the Jordan normal form.  Similarly for $GL_n(K)$ acting on $M_n(K)$, so that we have a bijection between the nilpotent orbits of $M_n(F)$ and $M_n(K)$ under their respective actions. Background Let $G$ be an affine group scheme over $\mathbb{Z}$, and let $X$ be an affine $\mathbb{Z}$-scheme on which $G$ acts via a map of schemes: $$G\times X\to X$$ or equivalently via a map of rings $$\varphi:\mathbb{Z}[X]\to \mathbb{Z}[G]\otimes\mathbb{Z}[X]$$ For a commutative ring $R$, we obtain an action of the $R$-points of $G$ on the $R$-points of $X$.  Specifically, given $\rho:\mathbb{Z}[X]\to R$ and $\tau:\mathbb{Z}[G]\to R$, we can define $\tau\cdot\rho$ to be the $R$-point given by the composition $$\mathbb{Z}[X]\xrightarrow{\varphi}\mathbb{Z}[G]\otimes\mathbb{Z}[X]\xrightarrow{\tau\otimes\rho}R\otimes R\to R$$ where the last map is multiplication in the ring.  With this notion of an action, we can similarly define $R$-orbits (of $G$ on $X$). Question For two commutative rings $R$ and $S$, when can we expect there to be a bijection between the $R$-orbits and $S$-orbits?  What are some reasonable hypotheses for $R$, $S$, $G$, $X$, and/or $\varphi$ to obtain such a bijection? Edit: As stated in the comments, a bijection is a rather weak result to seek; there should be something richer.  However, I don't know enough about group scheme actions to even hypothesize something else about two orbit spaces coming from the same action. In general, I'd like to learn more about the similarities between different orbit spaces coming from the same group scheme action.","['ring-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'abstract-algebra']"
479547,Fundamental group of a space under a group action,"The short version: Why does a Borcea-Voisin threefold has trivial fundamental group? Well, what is a Borcea-Voisin threefold? These are named after Borcea and Voisin, who introduced a method of constructing Calabi-Yau threefolds from elliptic curves (CY-onefolds) and K3 surfaces (CY-twofolds), and going through Voisin's proof that these threefolds are indeed Calabi-Yau, I'm stuck on why the fundamental group is trivial. In detail, let $E$ be an elliptic curve with canonical involution $(x,y)\mapsto (x,-y)$ (we're working in characteristic $0$). Let $S$ be a K3 surface with (non-symplectic) involution $\sigma$ acting by $-1$ on $H^{2,0}(S)$. Then the (crepant) resolution of $E\times S/\iota\times\sigma$ is a Calabi-Yau threefold. Denote the resolution by $X$. To see this, there are a few things to show (though I'm happy with showing the necessary Hodge numbers are zero, once $\pi_1(X)$ is trivial). Firstly, we can write the resolution $X$ as $\widetilde{E\times S}/\widetilde{\iota\times\sigma}$, where we blowup the fixed locus of $\iota\times\sigma$ on $E\times S$, then extend the action of $\iota\times\sigma$. The fixed locus of an elliptic curve under the involution is four isolated points (topological Lefschetz trace) and the fixed locus of $S$ under $\sigma$ is the union of (say) $N$ disjoint curves (holomorphic and topological Lefschetz trace). Thus, the fixed locus of $E\times S$ is the union of each $P_i\times C_j$, where each $P_i$ is an isolated (fixed) point on $E$ and $C_j$ is a (fixed) curve on $S$. If there is at least one fixed curve $C$ on $S$, there is at least one fixed point on $E\times S$, say $P$, and $\widetilde{\iota\times\sigma}$ acts on the fundamental group $\pi_1(\widetilde{E\times S},P)$ by $-1$, as
$$ \pi_1(\widetilde{E\times S},P) \simeq \pi_1(E\times S,P) \simeq \pi_1(E)\times\pi_1(S) \simeq \pi_1(E), $$
and the action of $\iota$ on $E$ passes through to $\pi_1(E)$. Voisin now claims this implies $\pi_1(X)$ is trivial, and I'm guessing it shouldn't be too difficult to justify, given there are no details, but I'm not too sure how this is done. I've also asked a few people that know far more about the fundamental group than I do, and no one had a solution (though they all say it's probably simple...) I'd love to just say
$$ \pi_1(X/G) \simeq \pi_1(X)^G, $$

I've tried to make it more abstract, but then it would raise more questions than give answers. I've come across a statistic where it says that men have slept on average with 13 women in their lifetime, and women with 7 men. Now, I know that this is not reliable information and so on but let's make the following presumptions: Man/Woman ratio is 1:1 Only type of coitus is in a heterosexual pair People don't lie in this sort of studies When two people pair up, it counts for both Is there any possibility for this?

479707,Ratio of Circumference to Diameter on a sphere,"I was listening to an audiobook of Einstein when they started discussing spherical geometry and how Pi was no longer the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, so I set out to find the answer.  From what I gathered, it is a variable that depends on an angle $\theta$ between the pole and the circle in question, since there are infinite parallel circles on a sphere. So the circumference I calculated through Euclidean methods would be $2\pi$ times the length of a side of a triangle opposite $\theta$.  If $r$ is the radius of the sphere, then we can find this two dimensional circles's radius as 
$$x=r\sin\theta.$$
So the circumference, $C_{\theta}$, then is $2\pi\cdot{r}\sin\theta$ Now we need the radius, which is the arc length from the pole, $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\sin\theta$.  Using parametrization of 
$$\mathbf{x}(t)=(r\cos{t},r\sin{t}),$$
The arclength would just be
$$\rho_{\theta}=\int_{\sin{\theta}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}||\mathbf{x}(t)||dt=\int_{\sin{\theta}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}rdt=r\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\sin\theta\right)$$
Multiplying by 2 gives us our diameter
So I think that this is the function in $\theta$ that gives us the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter;
$$R(\theta)=\frac{2\pi\cdot{r}\sin\theta}{2r\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\sin\theta\right)}=\frac{\pi\sin\theta}{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\sin\theta\right)}$$
Is this a correct approach? Edit; I can see my lower bound for my arclength integral was completely off, as it was 2 in the morning here when I was figuring this out....  The upper bound would be $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and my lower bound would be $\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta$.  Thus, if i would have integrated properly, 
$$\int_{\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}||\mathbf{x}(t)||dt=\int_{\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}rdt=r\left[\frac{\pi}{2}-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\right)\right]=r\theta$$
This would give the correct answer that was given below of
$$R(\theta)=\frac{\pi\sin\theta}{\theta}$$","['geometry', 'calculus', 'spherical-geometry']"

$$x^k+(x+1)^k+(x+2)^k+\cdots+(x+k-1)^k=(x+k)^k \tag{$\star$}.$$ The following two are famous:
$$3^2+4^2=5^2, 3^3+4^3+5^3=6^3.$$ I've tried to find the other integers which satisfy $(\star)$, but I can't find any nontrivial solution. Then, I suspect that the following might be proven true. My conjecture : There is no integer which satisfies $(\star)$ except $(k,x)=(2,-1),(2,3),(3,3)$. The followings are what I found: 1. In $k=4$ case, there is no integer which satisfies $(\star)$. Proof : Suppose that there exists an integer $x$ which satisfies $(\star)$
Then, considering in mod $4$, we reach a contradiction in each remainder, so the proof is completed. 2. Supposing that the one's digit of $k$ is $1$, then there is no integer which satisfies $(\star)$. Proof : In $k=1$ case, it's obvious. Letting $k=10n+1$ ($n$ is a natural number), let's consider in mod $5$. Let $a_l=l^k$ (mod $5$) ($l$ is an integer). (i) The $n=1,3,5,\cdots$ cases : 
$$a_{5m}\equiv 0, a_{5m+1}\equiv 1, a_{5m+2}\equiv 3, a_{5m+3}\equiv 2, a_{5m+4}\equiv 4.$$
(ii) The $n=2,4,6,\cdots$ cases :
$$a_{5m}\equiv 0, a_{5m+1}\equiv 1, a_{5m+2}\equiv 2, a_{5m+3}\equiv 3, a_{5m+4}\equiv 4.$$
Suppose that there exists an integer $x$ which satisfies $(\star)$. Letting $l=x+k-1$, we get
$$(0+1+2+3+4)\times 2n+a_l \equiv a_{l+1}\ \Rightarrow\ a_l\equiv a_{l+1}.$$
in both (i) and (ii). However, this doesn't happen because of the above. Hence, the proof is completed. 3. Suppose that $k+1$ is a prime number. If there exists an integer $x$ which satisfies $(\star)$, then $k=2$. Proof : Let's consider when $k=p-1$ ($p$ is a prime number which is more than or equal to $5$). We are going to consider in mod $p$. By Fermat's little theorem, note that 
$$a^{p-1}\equiv 0 (a\equiv0), 1(a\not\equiv 0).$$
Suppose that there exists an integer $x$ which satisfies $(\star)$. (i) The $x\not\equiv1$ case (the multiples of $p$ exists in the integers from $x$ to $x+p-2$): we get 
$$0+1\times (p-2)\equiv 1.$$
However, this doesn't happen because $p\ge5$. (ii) The $x\equiv1$ case (there is no multiples of $p$ in the integers from $x$ to $x+p-2$): we get 
$$1\times (p-1)\equiv 0.$$
However, this doesn't happen. Hence, the proof is completed. I crossposted to MO. https://mathoverflow.net/questions/141969/solving-xkx1kx2k-cdotsxk-1k-xkk-for-k-in-mathbb-n","['summation', 'exponential-function', 'number-theory']"

If $f$ can be extended to $\partial{\mathbb{H}}$, then the condition implies that $f$ must takes purely imaginary number on $\{x=0\}$. By proper rotation we can extend $f$ to the whole plane by Reflection Principle and thus the entire function $e^{f(z)}$ have at most growth order of 1, whence by Hadamard's factorization theorem with some detailed argument we get the conclusion. Here's the only obstacle that left within the argument: Can $f(z)$ be continuously extended to the boundary $\{x=0\}$ from the assumptions?",['complex-analysis']
