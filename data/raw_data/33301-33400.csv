317125,Topologist's sine curve is connected,"I just came across the example of the topologist's sine curve that is connected but not path-connected. The rigorous proof of the non-path-connectedness can be found here . But how can I prove that the curve is connected? To be honest, even intuitively I am not being able to see that the curve is connected. I am thinking if it is proved that the limit point of $\sin(1/x)$ as $x \to 0=0$, then it would be proved. But, why is this true? IMO, this limit doesn't exist. Intuitively also, it seems that the graph would behave crazily and not approach a particular value as a tends to $0.$ EDIT (Brett Frankel): There are a few different working definitions of the topologist's since curve. For the sake of clarity/consistency, I have copied below the definition used in the linked post:

\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) & \mbox{if $0\lt x \lt 1$,}\\\

317143,Compound Poisson process: distribution of stopped local time $L_T$,"Let $X_t$ be a compound Poisson process with positive drift
$$
X_t = t + \sum_{i=1}^{N_t}Y_i,

where $N_t \sim$Poisson$(\lambda t)$ and the $Y_i$ are i.i.d. with pdf $f$. With $M_t$ the process $X$ reflected from its maximum,
$$
M_t = \bar X_t - X_t,
$$
where $\bar X_t = \sup_{s\le t}X_s$, let $L_t$ be the local time at zero for $M_t$. Let $T$ be the hitting time of $M_t$ for $c>0$,
$$
T = \inf_{t\ge0}\{M_t \ge c\}.
$$
Find the distribution of $L_T$. Since $X_t$ is a compound Poisson process, then
$$
L_t = \int_0^t 1_{\{M_s=0\}}ds.
$$
Whence, by conditioning on $T$,
$$

317149,"Please, help me to find where is a mistake in the solutions of the equation.","I have this equation and I will be very thankful to anyone who can provide me any help with the one discrepancy in my solution and the solution from the self-learning website:

$$ My solution I solved it in not too graceful way. First I found the roots for this equation:
$$
\require{cancel}
\begin{align}
&\boxed{\frac{1+\tan(x)}{1-\tan(x)}= 1+\sin(2x)} \\ \\
&\frac{(1+\tan(x))\cancel{(1-\tan(x))}}{\cancel{1-\tan(x)}}= (1+\sin(2x))(1-\tan(x))\\ \\
&\cancel{1}+\tan(x)=\cancel{1} - \tan(x) + \sin(2x) - \sin(2x)\tan(x) \\
&\frac{\sin(2x)}{\tan(x)} - \frac{\sin(2x)\cancel{\tan(x)}}{\cancel{\tan(x)}} -\frac{2\cancel{\tan(x)}}{\cancel{\tan(x)}} = 0\\ \\
&\bbox[Beige]{\boxed{\sin(2\alpha)=2\sin(\alpha)\cos(\alpha)}} \\ \\
&\frac{\cancel{2}\cancel{\sin(x)}\cos(x)\cos(x)}{\cancel{\sin(x)}} - \cancel{2}\sin(x)\cos(x) - \cancel{2} = 0 \\ \\
&\cos^2(x) - \sin(x)\cos(x) -1 = 0\\ \\
&\bbox[Beige]{\boxed{\sin^2(\alpha) + \cos^2(\alpha) = 1}} \\ \\
&\cancel{\cos^2(x)} - \sin(x)\cos(x) - \sin^2(x) - \cancel{\cos^2(x)} = 0\\ \\
&\sin^2(x) + \sin(x)\cos(x) = 0 \\ \\
&\sin(x)(\sin(x) + \cos(x)) = 0 \\ \\
&\sin(x) = 0 \implies \boxed{x_1=\pi k ,\space k \in \mathbb{Z}} \\ \\
&\sin(x) + \cos(x) = 0 \implies \tan(x) = -1 \implies \boxed{x_2=\frac{\pi}{4}\left(4m - 1\right) ,\space m \in \mathbb{Z}}
\end{align}
$$
Also I checked that there were no parasite and missing roots, cause I've divided the equation by $\tan(x)$ and multiplied it by $1-\tan(x)$. There were no such ones cause $\tan(x)$ cannot assume $1$, when $\sin(x)=0$ or $\tan(x) = -1$, and the missing roots with $\tan(x) = 0$ are a subset of $x_1$. Then I checked which of these roots fitted the next equation:
$$
\frac{1+\tan(x) + \tan^2(x)}{1-\tan(x) + \tan^2(x)}= 1+\sin(2x)
$$ And it turned out that only $x_1$ did. Then my logic was: if there were another roots for the next steps of this sequence, e.g. $\frac{1+\tan(x) + \tan^2(x) + \tan^3(x)}{1-\tan(x) + \tan^2(x) - \tan^3(x)}= 1+\sin(2x)$ they would not fit the first step while $x_1$ would fit all steps. So the only solution is $x_1 = \pi k ,\space k \in \mathbb{Z}$ Possibly the wrong solution with my correction. You can see the original one at the www.bymath.com It is obvious that the fraction numerator and denominator are geometrical sequences (progressions) with the common ratios $\tan(x)$ and $-\tan(x)$ correspondingly. Note, that here $|\tan(x)| < 1$, otherwise the left-hand side expression is meaningless. Therefore it is possible to transform the fraction numerator and denominator by the sum formula for the unboundedly decreasing geometric sequence (progression) $\bbox[Beige]{\boxed{S = \frac{b_1}{1-q}}}$, where $b$ is the first member of a sequence and $q$ in a ratio. $$
\begin{align}
&\frac{1}{1 - \tan(x)} : \frac{1}{1 - (-\tan(x))} = 1 + \sin(2x) \\
&\frac{1}{1 - \tan(x)} * (1 + \tan(x)) = 1 + \sin(2x) \\
&\bbox[Beige]{\boxed{\sin(\alpha) = \frac{2\tan(\frac{\alpha}{2})}{1+\tan^2(\frac{\alpha}{2})}}} \\
&\frac{1 + \tan(x)}{1 - \tan(x)} - 1 - \frac{2\tan(x)}{1+\tan^2(x)} = 0\\ \\
&\frac{(1 + \tan(x))(1+\tan^2(x)) - (1 - \tan(x))(1+\tan^2(x)) - 2\tan(x)(1 - \tan(x))}{(1 - \tan(x))(1+\tan^2(x))} = 0\\ \\
&\frac{1 + \tan^2 x + \tan x + \tan^3 x  -(1 + \tan^2 x - \tan x - \tan^3 x ) -2\tan x + 2\tan^2 x}{(1 - \tan x)(1+\tan^2 x)} =0 \\
\end{align}
$$ So here is the point where this second solution is wrong . The right is this: $$
\begin{align}
&\frac{\cancel{1} + \cancel{\tan^2 x} + \cancel{\tan x} + \tan^3 x -\cancel{1} - \cancel{\tan^2 x} + \cancel{\tan x} + \tan^3 x -\cancel{2\tan x} + 2\tan^2 x}{(1 - \tan x)(1+\tan^2 x)} =0 \\
&\frac{2\tan^3 x + 2\tan^2 x}{(1 - \tan x)(1+\tan^2 x)} =0 \implies \tan x = 0, \ \tan x = -1 \\
\end{align}
$$ Whereas the author of the site got this : $\frac{4\tan^3 x}{(1 - \tan x)(1+\tan^2 x)} =0 \implies \tan x = 0$ and lost one root $x_2=\frac{\pi}{4}\left(4m - 1\right) ,\space m \in \mathbb{Z}$ ACTUALLY QUESTION So when I looked to the second solution I was pretty confused with this: in that solution it is said that unless $|tan(x)| < 1$ the left-hand side of the equation in meaningless. Why, can somebody explain, please? I suppose that this is not true cause: while the transformation with the sum formula was correct, the solution itself was wrong the right solution gives us two roots one of which does not fit all possible steps of the sequences, hence the numerator and denominator are not a unboundedly decreasing geometric sequence (progression) . Is my conclusion correct? My sincerest appreciation.","['trigonometry', 'self-learning', 'sequences-and-series', 'roots']"

What I'm trying to calculate is the number of possible combinations we could have for this puzzle. My first thought was (6^36) since we have 36 field with 6 options for each ( just like coin flipping) but that is n * 10^28. which is a lot ! and far from accurate. The solution is a partial set of that value because we have a lot of extra constrains on it, which are: 1 must come only after 1 (since the car is two blocks in length) and not at the end of the line ( location (1) % 6 != 5). same condition apply to 2 but this time 2 is repeated 3 times and (location (2) % 6 < 5) 5 must only be between (12 and 17) and follow 1 restrictions. 6 similar rules to 1 but applies vertically.

The number of ways that it can be expressed as the difference of two squares depends on how many factors it has.  For example, d can always be expressed as the difference of the squares of (d+1)/2 and (d-1)/2, and if it is composite (d=ab; it may be factorable in many distinct ways), then the squares of the numbers (a+b)/2 and (a-b)/2 have the difference d.  Note that if d is prime, then the only set of numbers whose squares differ by d are (d+1)/2 and (d-1)/2; if d is a semiprime (d=pq) then the only additional set of numbers whose squares differ by d are (p+q)/2 and (p-q)/2.  Odd numbers with more than two prime factors will in general be expressable as the difference of multiple pairs of squares (cubes of primes are one exception; I don't know whether there are others).

317309,"Favourable modification of ""Double or Nothing""","I am working through 'Great expectations: the theory of optimal stopping' by Y.S. Chow, H. Robbins, D. Siegmund and cannot fill in the gap in reasoning regarding the existence of optimal stopping rule. Let me describe the problem: Favourable modification of ""Double or Nothing"". A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. After each toss we have the option of stopping or going on to the next toss, our decision at each stage being allowed to depend on the outcomes thus far. We must stop after some finite (but not preassigned) number of tosses, and it is agreed that if we stop after the $n$th toss we are to receive a reward $X_n$. In ""Double or Nothing"", for the player starting with $1$ unit, the reward would be $\prod_{i=1}^n (Y_i+1)$ where $Y_i=1$ denotes heads on the $i$th toss and $Y_i=-1$ tails. We, however, consider the case in which we are encouraged to continue playing by multiplying the above reward by the increasing sequence $2n/(n+1)$, yielding the reward sequence $$X_n=\frac{2n}{n+1}\prod_{i=1}^n (Y_i+1) \quad (n=1,2,\ldots),$$ which is $0$ if there are any tails in the first $n$ tosses and $2^{n+1}n/(n+1)$ otherwise. Let me define $V=\sup_\tau\{\mathbb{E}X_\tau\}$ (supremum over the class of all possible stopping rules $\tau$ for which $\mathbb{E}X_\tau$ exists). We shall call $V$ the value of the sequence $\{X_n\}$. We are interested in finding $V$ and an optimal rule (i.e. stopping rule $\tau^*$ such that $V=\mathbb{E}X_{\tau^*}$) if it exists. After defining the problem authors proceed to solve the problem: (?) A little reflection will show that we need to consider only the class of stopping rules $\{\tau_k\}, k=1,2\ldots,$ where $\tau_k=k$; i.e. $\tau_k$ stops after the $k$th toss no matter what sequence of heads and tails has appeared. (?) Clearly, $$\mathbb{E}X_{\tau_k}=\frac{1}{2^k}\cdot\frac{k2^{k+1}}{k+1}+\left(1-\frac{1}{2^k}\right)\cdot0=\frac{2k}{k+1},$$ and therefore $V=2$ but no optimal stopping rule exists. Here is my problem: I have literally no reflection why is it the case that one can restrict only to the class of constant stopping rules. Precisely, why does the inequality $$\sup\{\mathbb{E}X_\tau\mid\tau=k\}\ge\sup\mathbb{E}X_\tau$$

317467,How to correct/filter inaccurate speeds calculated from a GPS track,"I am working on a simple application that allows the user to do a lot of different things with a GPX file (GPS track).  Some things computed are: average speed, max speed, etc.  The max speed values I'm getting are very unrealistic, and when I look at a plot of the data, it's clear that there are spikes that represent inaccuracies.  See the image below, which was a snowboarding run I did the other day... there are two spikes of ~57mph and 70mph, which I know are inaccurate. I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but I know there are probably multiple approaches to filtering/smoothing/correcting this data to remove the erroneous values, while retaining the quality I desire. What is the best approach to accomplish that goal, and why? A quick explanation of how the values in the plot are generated: each point logged by the GPS unit contains latitude/longitude values and a time value.  Using the spherical law of cosines, the distance between any neighboring points in the track can be calculated, and that along with the time elapsed gives the average speed for the segment between those two points.  This is repeated for each set of neighboring points in the track to generate the plot above.  Obviously the inaccurate speed values are a result of positioning error from the GPS unit... if it logs me too far backward for one logged point, and then too far forward for the next point, the distance covered in that segment is calculated as much higher than it really was, and therefore so is my speed.  In the segment leading up to the highest spike in the plot above, I supposedly increased my speed from ~12mph to 70mph over a segment of 100ft.",['statistics']
317470,The definition of distance and how to prove the ruler postulate in Euclidean geometry,"I have started to read some books about geometry. At the moment I've just started to read Hilbert's axioms and also some elementary books for highschool. From the basic perspective of an axiomatic system, the elementary books, I mean not necessarily for highschool but also not for mathematicians, start with some axioms that are not entirely independent. Most of them states the ruler postulate as an axiom, for example from Venema's approach: For every pair of points $P$ and $Q$ there exists a real number $PQ$, called the distance from $P$ to $Q$. For each line there is a one-to-one correspondence from $l$ to $R$ such that if $P $ and $Q$ are points on the line that correspond to the real numbers $x$ and $y$, respectively, then $PQ=|x−y|$. So, my question is more in the sense of the definition of ""distance"". With this postulate, for example, the definition is implicit. So I wanted to know, right from the Hilbert's system or some other system that is more basic, how do they define ""distance"". Also I'd like to know how to prove the ruler postulate.","['analytic-geometry', 'geometry', 'foundations']"

I was wondering whether there is an easier proof - my own proof seems rather like overkill to me. Thanks!","['probability-theory', 'weak-convergence', 'convergence-divergence', 'random-variables']"

317878,Group actions transitive on certain subsets,"Let $G$ be a group acting on a finite set $X$. This also gives an action of $G$ on the subsets of $X$ of any given size, and we can ask whether this action is transitive for some specified size of subsets. My question is first whether there is a term for this (Edit: Derek Holt has pointed out that if the induced action on subsets of size $n$ is transitive, then the action is called $n$-homogeneous). It is clear that transitive is equivalent to $1$-homogenous, and further, one can show that if the action is $n$-homogenous for some $1\leq n\leq |X| - 1$ then it is also transitive. To see this, let $a$ and $b$ be distinct elements of $X$ and consider two subsets of $X$ of size $n$, $A = \{a,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}\}$ and $B = \{b,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}\}$. Let $g\in G$ be given such that $g.A = B$. Since $X$ is finite, there is some $m$ such that $g^m.a = a\not\in B$ so let $i$ be the smallest such that $g^i.a\not\in B$. If $g^j.a\in A$ then $g^{j+1}.a\in B$, so by construction we have $g^{i-1}.a\in B\setminus A = \{b\}$ so $g^{i-1}.a = b$ and the proof is done. Another thing to note is that if $|X| = m$ then the action is $n$-homogenous if and only if it is $(m-n)$-homogenous (by looking at the corresponding action on the complements). Now, my second question is: If the action is $n$-homogenous for some $1\leq n\leq \frac{m}{2}$ can we conclude that the action is $(n-1)$-homogenous?","['group-theory', 'group-actions']"

Is it possible to derive any results on $W_1(\mu,\nu)$ using $\{d(X_i,Y_j)\}_{ij}$, with some confidence-like bounds? Some thoughts: let $\gamma(d):=\int_{X\times X}d(x,y)\mathrm d\gamma$.
