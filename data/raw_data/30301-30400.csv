283654,How do I use student's-t distribution without the sample size?,"Here is my question (homework obviously): A sample from a normal population produced variance 4.0.
Find the size of the sample if the sample mean deviates from the population
mean by no more than 2.0 with a probability of at least 0.95. So I'm trying to find $n$, the sample size, having only $\hat{\sigma}$, the sample variance, and a bound on the distance between $\bar{x}$ and $\mu$. My intuition was normally in this situation we need to use the t distribution since $\hat{\sigma}$ is an unbiased estimate for $\sigma$ (we did all the proofs in class).The problem is the t distribution changes depending on $n$, the sample size, so which distribution (how many degrees of freedom) should I consult when looking up the t-values containing 95% of the probability mass? I tried it for different values of $n$, and then squared the values to compare them to the d.f. of the t distribution - the closest I could get was 0.6 off. (I took the t-value at $\alpha = 0.025$ (right-tail) for 5 d.f., implying $n$ is 6, and squaring the t-value gave me 6.61, which is a discrepancy of 0.61 (isn't this large?). The reason I squared the t-values becomes apparent if you ""normalize"" the bound on the means into a t-statistic. Am I going about this correctly? This doesn't seem right...","['statistics', 'estimation']"

283679,Proof that monotone functions are integrable with the classical definition of the Riemann Integral,"Let $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ be a monotone function (say strictly increasing). Then, do for every $\epsilon>0$ exist two step functions $h,g$ so that $g\le f\le h$ and $0\le h-g\le \epsilon$ ? Does there exist some closed form of these functions like the one below? I encountered the problem when trying to prove the Riemann Integrability of monotone functions via the traditional definition of the Riemann Integral (not the one with Darboux sums). The book I am reading proves that a continuous function is integrable via the process below: Let $\mathcal{P}=\left\{ a=x_0<...<x_n=b \right\}$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ . Define $m_i=\min_{x\in [x_{i-1},x_i]}f(x)$ and $M_i=\max_{x\in [x_{i-1},x_i]}f(x)$ . By the Extreme Value theorem $M_i,m_i$ are well defined. We approximate $f$ with step functions: \begin{gather}g=m_1\chi_{[x_0,x_1]}+\sum_{i=2}^nm_i\chi_{(x_{i-1},x_i]}\\
h=M_1\chi_{[x_0,x_1]}+\sum_{i=2}^nM_i\chi_{(x_{i-1},x_i]}\end{gather} It is easily seen that they satisfy the ""step function approximation"" and as $0\le \int_a^bh-g\le \epsilon$ (uniform continuity) by a previous theorem $f$ is integrable. The book then goes on to generalise by discussing regulated functions. I would like however to see a self contained proof similar to the previous one if $f$ is monotone.

283680,Functions in calculus - notation,"I don't have an extensive formal training in calculus, but I'm doing quite a lot of differential calculus work at the moment and there's something which bothers me. Say I have the differential $\dfrac{d\ln (P(x))}{d\ln(x)}$ Where $P$ is some unknown function By defining $u = \ln(x)$ I can re-write this as $\dfrac{d\ln (P(e^u))}{du}$ Which I would then solve (using prime notation) as follows $\dfrac{f(g(h(u)))}{du}$ $f(z) = \ln(z)$ , $f'(z) = \dfrac{1}{z}$ $g(z) = P(z)$, $g(z)' = P'(z)$ $h(z) = e^z$, $h'(z) = e^z$ So using the chain rule ( note I'm being super explicit in my steps ) $\dfrac{f(g(h(u)))}{du} = f'(g(h(u)) \times g(h(u))' $ $g(h(u))' = g'(h(u)) \times h'(u)$ $\dfrac{f(g(h(u)))}{du} = f'(g(h(u)) \times  g'(h(u)) \times h'(u) $ $\dfrac{f(g(h(u)))}{du} = \dfrac{1}{P(e^u)} \times  P'(e^u) \times e^u $ $\dfrac{f(g(h(u)))}{du} = \dfrac{P'(e^u)e^u }{P(e^u)}  $ $\dfrac{f(g(h(x)))}{dx} = \dfrac{xP'(x)}{P(x)}$ $\dfrac{d\ln (P(x))}{d\ln(x)} = \dfrac{x}{P(x)}P'(x)$ 1) is this kind of mixing and matching of Leibniz and prime notation even ""legal""? If not, should I really re-write the differential as $V'(\ln(x)) = \dfrac{d\ln (P(x))}{d\ln(x)} \text{ where } \Bigg(V(x) = \ln (P(x))\Bigg)$
(i.e. is this correct?) 2) I prefer to use prime notation, but does this have any significant drawbacks (other than being less ""clean"" in places, i.e. you can treat $\dfrac{df(x)}{dx}$ as a fraction in certain conditions). 3) given that P is a function (say P is defined as $P = kx + cx^2$), what is the difference between $\dfrac{P(x)}{dx}$ and $\dfrac{P}{dx}$ I'm trying to work out if the stuff I'm reading is just using inconsistent notation, or if there are crucial functional/semantic differences I'm not understanding. UPDATE: Dealing with $\dfrac{d\ln(P(x))}{d\ln(x)}$ For a concrete example, say P(x) = 2x+5, so, as mentioned above, we define $u = \ln(x)$ We would re-write $\dfrac{d\ln(2x+5)}{d\ln(x)}$ as $\dfrac{d\ln(2e^u+5)}{du}$, then solve this getting $\dfrac{2e^u}{2e^u+5}$ And finally substitute $\ln(x)$ back in for $u$ $\dfrac{2x}{2x+5}$","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'functions']"

  adjoints going the other way, $\bf Semigroup \to \bf Monoid$ (adjoin a 1), and
  $\bf Monoid \to \bf Group$ (enveloping group). So: first adjoin a 1, then
  construct the enveloping group. What are the properties of the composed functor: $F: \bf Group \to \bf Semigroup$? In particular is it full and/or faithful? Or are there multiple inclusion functors from which a particular one needs to be specified? Faithful functor: $\forall (f,g: A \to B),  Ff = Fg \implies f = g$ Full: $\forall (h: FA\to FB), \exists (f: A \to B):Ff = h$ As an FYI, as magma cites from Adamek & Herrlich's Abstract and Contrete Categories , a fully faithful functor reflects isos, sections, and retracts.

283747,"Determine whether $\lim_{(x,y)\to (2,-2)} \frac{\sin(x+y)}{x+y}$ exists.","I am trying to determine whether $\lim_{(x,y)\to (2,-2)} \dfrac{\sin(x+y)}{x+y}$ exists. I should be able to use the following definition for a limit of a function of two variables: Let $f$ be a function of two variables that is defined on some open disk $B((x_0,y_0),r)$ , except possibly at the point $(x_0,y_0)$ itself. Then $$\lim_{(x,y)\to (x_0,y_0)}f(x,y)=L$$ if for any $\varepsilon>0$ , however small, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $$\text{if } 0<\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2}<\delta \text{ then } |f(x,y)-L|<\varepsilon$$ The limit definition above applied to the limit $\lim_{(x,y)\to (2,-2)} \dfrac{\sin(x+y)}{x+y}$ requires that the function $\dfrac{\sin(x+y)}{x+y}$ be defined on every point of some open disk $B((2,-2),r)$ (with the possible exception of the point $(2,-2)$ ). My problem here is that the function $\dfrac{\sin(x+y)}{x+y}$ is undefined for $x+y=0$ , that is, it is undefined for all points in the line $y=-x$ . If I understood it correctly, it seems to mean that I can't find any open disk $B((2,-2),r)$ on which the given function is defined. Therefore, it seems that I can't apply the limit definition. What am I misunderstanding here? The argument above makes me believe that this limit does not exist (because I can't apply the definition), but Wolfram|Alpha says that the value of this limit is $1$ . Why this apparent contradiction? Edit : I should point out that this problem and the limit definition that I'm using are both taken from the same book. So, the book assumes that I will use the given limit definition. Update I have one more doubt concerning this. The same book that I'm using says that the function below is continuous for all points $(x,y)$ in $R_2$ . $$f(x,y)=\begin{cases} \dfrac{\sin(x+y)}{x+y} & \text{ if $x + y \neq 0$} \\ 1 & \text{ if $x + y = 0$}\end{cases}$$ The proof is as follows: Let $h(t)=\begin{cases} \dfrac{\sin(t)}{t} & \text{ if $t \neq 0$} \\ 1 & \text{ if $t = 0$}\end{cases}$ and $g(x,y) = x+y$ ; so, $f(x,y) = h(g(x,y))$ . The domain of $g$ is $R_2$ and it is continuous everywhere in its domain. Since $g(x,y)\to 0$ as $x+y\to 0$ and $h$ is continuous at $0$ , $h(g(x,y))$ is continuous everywhere. The definition of continuity in this book states that, for a two-variable function $g$ to be continuous at $(x_0,y_0)$ , $g(x_0,y_0)$ has to exist and $\lim_{(x,y)\to (x_0,y_0)} g(x,y)$ has to be equal to $g(x_0,y_0)$ . So, by the given definition of continuity, $f(x,y)$ being continuous everywhere means that $\lim_{(x,y)\to (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0)$ for all $(x_0,y_0)$ . The proof above seems to imply that $\lim_{(x,y)\to (2,-2)} \dfrac{\sin(x+y)}{x+y}$ should exist. But the problem is that this limit should not exist, considering the definition of limit that I am using in this question. Is there a contradiction here or am I missing something?","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'limits']"
283749,Irreducibility of $X^n - 2$ over $\mathbf Z[i]$.,"I was “playing” with Eisenstein's criterion and the polynomials $X^n-p$ ($p$ being a prime number). Over $\mathbf Z$, the classical Eisenstein's criterion directly applies and shows that $X^n - p$ is an irreducible element of $\mathbf Z[X]$. The question was “what happens over $\mathbf Z[i]$?” We know that in this new ring, a prime number $p$ has one of three different fates: if $p \equiv -1\ (\mathrm{mod}\, 4)$, $p$ still is an irreducible element of $\mathbf Z[i]$, or equivalently $(p) \subset \mathbf Z[i]$ still is prime. (Unless I'm mistaken, number theorists say that $p$ is inert ). Eisenstein's criterion still applies and the polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbf Z[i]$. if $p \equiv 1\ (\mathrm{mod}\, 4)$, $p$ can be written as a sum of two squares: $p = n^2 + m^2$ and is therefore reducible on $\mathbf Z[i]$: $p = (n+im)(n-im)$. These two factors aren't associated (the units in $\mathbf Z[i]$ being $\pm 1$ and $\pm i$) so $(p)$ splits : $(p) = (n+im)(n-im)$ is the product of two different prime ideals. One can still use Eisenstein's criterion with either of these prime ideals, and $X^n - p$ is irreducible over $\mathbf Z[i]$. if $p = 2$, the oddest of all primes, one still has a factorisation $p = (1+i)(1-i)$ but this time, $1+i$ and $1-i$ are associated. In NT slang, $(2)$ is ramified : $(2) = (1+i)(1-i) = (1+i)^2$ and one cannot directly use Eisenstein's criterion. So here's my question: how do we prove (or disprove) the irreducibility of $X^n - 2$ over $\mathbf Z[i]$?","['irreducible-polynomials', 'number-theory']"

283770,"when integrating a Laurent series $f(z)=\sum\limits_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}a_j(z-z_0)^j$, why do all terms for $j\neq-1$ dissappear?","In my complex analysis book we are looking at a Laurent series expression for $f(z)$ around a singularity $z_0$ that converges to $f(z)$ for all $z\in C, z\neq z_0$. The Laurent series looks like $$f(z)=\sum\limits_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}a_j(z-z_0)^j$$
We are integrating this series along some simply connected closed contour $\Gamma$ lying in $C$ which goes around $z_0$ with a positive orientation. (So f(z) is analytic everywhere on and within $\Gamma$ except at $z_0$). It says that we can integrate termwise which makes a lot of sense but somehow the integral of all terms for $j\neq-1$ is said to dissappear. This is strange to me because these terms are of the form $\frac{a_{-2}}{(z-z_0)^2}, \frac{a_{-3}}{(z-z_0)^3}\ldots$ meaning that each of these terms has a singularity at $z_0$ and thus the integral along $\Gamma$ should not vanish?

283805,insphere/circumsphere ratio of a polyhedron the same as its dual polyhedron?,"Is the $r/R$ ratio for any polyhedron always the same as the $r/R$ ratio of the dual of that polyhedron? Given any polyhedron, we can find the biggest sphere that fits inside it (its insphere) and the smallest sphere outside it (its circumsphere).
I'm interested in $r/R$, which is the ratio of the radius of the insphere to the radius of the circumsphere. Motivation: the worst-case linear distortion of a polyhedral global map projection is roughly (at least) $r/R$.
The $r/R$ ratio is one of many ways to measure how close a polyhedron is to a sphere. Some of those measures say the dodecahedron is the closest Platonic solid to the sphere.
Others say the icosahedron is the closest Platonic solid to the sphere.
Polyhedrons with larger r/R ratio are better, in the sense that they (usually) produce maps with less linear distortion. I'm surprised to discover that that ratio seem to be equal between the dodecahedron and the icosahedron (both ~ $0.7946$), and a (somewhat smaller) ratio is the same between the cube and the octahedron (both ~ $0.5773$).
(I'm not so surprised that an (even smaller) ratio is the same between the remaining Platonic solid and its dual polyhedron: $1/3$).
Can this surprising-to-me fact be generalized to some larger group of polyhedrons?

$$\Gamma_1: z=t \text{ where } -R\leq t \leq R$$
$$\Gamma_2: z=Re^{i\theta} \text{ where } 0\leq \theta \leq \pi$$
And $\Gamma_3=\Gamma_1+\Gamma_2$. Basically $\Gamma_3$ is the closed half circle in the upper half of the complex plane and $\Gamma_1$ runs along the real axis from $-R$ to $R$. Now we have:
$$I=\lim\limits_{R\to \infty}\int\limits_{\Gamma_1}f(z)dz=\lim\limits_{R\to \infty}\oint_{\Gamma_3}f(z)dz-\lim\limits_{R\to \infty}\int_{\Gamma_2}f(z)dz$$
We can compute $\lim\limits_{R\to \infty}\oint_{\Gamma_3}f(z)dz=\lim\limits_{R\to \infty}\oint_{\Gamma_3}\frac{z\sin(3z)}{(z+2i)(z-2i)}dz$ fairly easily after recognizing that it has simple poles at $z_0=\pm 2i$ and only $z_0=2i$ is enclosed in $\Gamma_3$. By the residue theorem:
$$\lim\limits_{R\to \infty}\oint_{\Gamma_3}f(z)dz=2\pi i \left(\mathop{Res} _{z=2i}(f)\right)=2\pi i \lim\limits_{z\to 2i}(z-2i)f(z)=2\pi i \frac{2  i\sin(6 i)}{2 i +2i}=\pi i \sin(6i)$$
Now the only obstacle to finding the value of our original integral is finding $\lim\limits_{R\to \infty}\int_{\Gamma_2}f(z)dz$. If $f(z)$ were such that the degree of the polynomial in the denominator was at least 2 higher then the polynomial in the numerator (ignoring the $\sin$) we could easily show that the integral vanishes.

For a total of $$\left(N-1\right)!{{N+M} \choose N}\sum_{k_1+...+k_N=M} \left( {{M} \choose k1 \ldots k_N} \prod_{i,k_i>0} k_i^{k_i-1} \right)$$ Can this expression be simplified?

Being unfamiliar with analytic combinatorics (Though I have signed up to the course in Coursea just now :), I can only try to reach the result Marko Riedel shows from the previously stated formula, $$\left(N-1\right)!{{N+M} \choose N}\sum_{k_1+...+k_N=M} \left( {{M} \choose k1 \ldots k_N} \prod_{i,k_i>0} k_i^{k_i-1} \right)$$ by rewriting it as $$\frac{(M+N)!}{N} \sum_{k_1+...+k_N=M} \left( \prod_{i,k_i>0} \frac{k_i^{k_i-1}}{k_i!} \right)$$ Wanting to express the sum as the $[X_M]$th element of the $N$th power of a formal series, as $k$s can be $0$ we rewrite t as $$
\frac{(M+N)!}{N} \cdot [x_M] \left(1 + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^{k-1}}{k!} x^k \right)^N
= \frac{(M+N)!}{N} \cdot [x_M] \left(1 - W(-x)\right)^N$$ Where $W$ is the Lambert W function. Yes hindsight is nice... :) Somewhat similar interesting problems are: (1) The same problem removing the restriction of growing a single tree onto every node of the cycle. This is the same as asking for the number of undirected graphs with $N+M$ labeled nodes where only a single cycle exists and it's length is $N$. $$\frac{(N+M)!}{N} \sum_{k_1+\ldots+k_N=M}\prod_{i,k_i>0}\left(N\frac{k_i^{k_i-1}}{k_i!}\right)$$ (2) The same problem but having the cycle already in place. That is the amount of ways to grow $M$ labeled nodes as trees (One per cycle node at most) onto a given cycle of length $N$. $$M! \sum_{k_1+\ldots +k_N=M}\prod_{i,k_i>0} \frac{k_i^{k_i-1}}{k_i!}$$ (3/4) The same problem having the labeled cycle already in place but the trees being grown onto it (Either with the restriction of one tree at most per cycle node or without) are unlabeled.","['graph-theory', 'combinatorics']"

Then $S_n = X_1 + \dots+ X_n$ is a Binomial random variable with parameters $(n,p)$, and the sum we are interested in is just:

The sequence $(S_n)$ is a random walk over $\mathbb{Z}$ but since we are only interested in its residue modulo $m$ it will be better to see it as a random walk over $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ (with an abuse of notation, we will still write $S_n$ for this residue). Step 2 (limit behaviour of the random walk). Quick version, with Markov Chains The random walk $(S_n)$ is an irreducible (and aperiodic) Markov Chain over the finite state space $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ with transition matrix given by $Q(i,i)=1-p$ and $Q(i,i+1)=p$ for $i \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. It admits the uniform distribution as a stationnary distribution, hence it converges to this distribution. QED Step 2 (bis). Without Markov Chains The following result (inversion formula for the discrete Fourier transform) is a generalization of @vonbrand's trick: Note $S = \{0,\dots,m-1\}$ and $\omega=\exp\left(i2\pi/m\right)$. For every function $f \colon S\to \mathbb{C}$ and every $x \in S$,
  $$ f(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^{m-1} \widehat{f}(k)\,\omega^{kx},\qquad\text{where}\quad \widehat{f}(k) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{x=0}^{m-1}f(x)\omega^{-kx}.
$$ In particular, we have
$$
E(f(S_n)) = \sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\widehat{f}(k)\,E\left[\omega^{k S_n}\right] 
$$
The sequence $X_1,X_2,\dots$ being i.i.d.,
$$
E\left[\omega^{k S_n}\right] = \left(E\left[\omega^{k X_1}\right] \right)^n = ((1-p)+p\omega^k)^n \xrightarrow[n\to\infty]{}\begin{cases}1 & \text{if } k=0\\0 & \text{else}\end{cases}
$$
Hence, $\lim_{n\to\infty} E[f(S_n)] = \widehat{f}(0)$. Taking $f(x) = 1_{\{x = r\}}$ yields the result.","['random-walk', 'binomial-coefficients', 'limits']"
284294,Quotient-lifting properties,"I borrowed this terminology from K. Conrad's article on series of subgroups , in which he discusses solvability of groups. This property of certain groups satisfies Let $N\triangleleft G$. Then $G$ is solvable if and only if both $N$ and $G/N$ are solvable. This says solvability is a quotient-lifting property in the sense that it can be passed down to substructures and quotients, and it can also be lifted up. I think it is natural to abstract this a little bit. Say we are studying some structures $\mathcal{A}$, with a substructure $J$ and the quotient $\mathcal{A}/J$, and P is a certain property. We say P is quotient-lifting if $\mathcal{A}$ has P if and only if both $J$ and $\mathcal{A}/J$ have P . Apart from solvability of groups, being Noetherian is a quotient-lifting property of modules. Quotient-lifting properties allow us to break a large structure to smaller parts, and probably would make life easier. Also, whenever we have a quotient-lifting property P , it allows us to define a maximal object with property P inside a given $\mathcal{A}$. This follows from similar argument in Let $N,H\triangleleft G$. If both $N$ and $H$ are solvable then $NH$ is solvable. (So in particular, we can take all solvable normal subgroup $\{N_{\alpha}\}$ in $G$ then $\Pi N_{\alpha}$ is the maximal solvable normal subgroup in $G$.) I hope to learn more about these properties: 1) do we have some general results concerning quotient-lifting properties? 2) what are other nice examples of quotient-lifting properties? 3) apart from abstract algebra, do we have such things in other parts of mathematics?

284360,Computing the limit of the expectation of a function of a stochastic process (phew!),"I state my problem in a few lines then describe what I have already done. I have a quite simple stochastic differential equation (SDE): $dx=-2x \, dt+\sqrt{1-x^2} \, dW$ with $W$ a brownian. I want to compute $\displaystyle{\lim_{t\to 0}}~\mathbb{E}\left[B_t\tanh\left(A_t\frac{x(t)-x(0)}{t}\right)|x(0)\right]$ and can't manage to do it. I want to describe a given phenomenon obeying my SDE, thus the factors B_t and A_t will depend on $t$. This is to ensure that as I decrease the time increment $t$ through which I approximate my continuous phenomenom by a ""discrete"" growth rate, as one cannot differentiate a Brownian, I will converge towards a given value. It is equivalent to the normalisation having to be applied to a random walk diffusion coefficient when one wants to converge to the ""underlying"" brownian.   EDIT : $A_t\propto \sqrt{t}$ and $B_t \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} This is my problem, any suggestions are welcome, below i expand on where I am, and how I approach the problem : Let $\phi(x(t),t)$ be a twice differentiable function, Ito's lemma yields that if $\phi(x(t),t)$ is solution of : 
$$(1)~\frac{\partial \phi }{\partial t}-2x\frac{\partial \phi }{\partial x}+\frac{1-x^2}{2}\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2}=0\textrm{, with }\phi(x,0)=\Phi(x(0))\textrm{ as initial condition,}$$ then $\phi(x(t),t)=E[\Phi(x(0))|x(t)=x]$. Noting that the partial differential equation (1) can be rewritten as $\partial_t\phi=M[\phi]$ with $M[.]$ a linear operator, any function of the form : $$\phi(x,t)=f(x)+\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty}\frac{t^n}{n!}M^n[f]$$ is a solution to the PDE (1), satisfying the initial condition $\phi(x,0)=f(x)$. Taking $\Phi(x(0))=x(0)$, for example, and with $t>0$, yields $$\mathbb{E}[x(t)|x(0)]=x(0)e^{-2t}$$ thus $\displaystyle{\lim_{t\to 0}}~\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{x(t)-x(0)}{t}|x(0)\right]=-2x(0)$ My problem is that $B_t~tanh\left(A_t\frac{x(t)-x(0)}{t}\right)$ is undefined at $t=0$, thus I cannot use the same approach. I tried to compute the characteristic function as i can compute all the moments, then Fourier-transform it to get the distribution, but it doesn't seem to give any meaningful result, which I guess comes from the fact that the distribution tends towards pathological functions (Dirac distributions) as $t\to 0$ thus I i am not allowed to switch the limit and the expectation operator anymore. I can expand if need be, but i think I'll already be lucky if anyone read this far :). Thanks in advance EDIT I also tried to Taylor expand the $tanh$ (not bothering about radius of convergence to start with) apply the expectation operator, which I can compute when applied to any power of $x$. By $b_{2n}$ I denote the coefficient of the Taylor expansion of $tanh$.
\begin{eqnarray} 
B_t\tanh\left(A_t\frac{x(t)-x(0)}{t}\right)&=&B_t\tanh\left(A_t\frac{\Delta x}{t}\right)\\
&=&B_t\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty}b_{2n}\frac{A_t^{2n-1}}{t^{2n-1}}\Delta x^{2n-1}\\
&=&B_t\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty}b_{2n}\frac{A_t^{2n-1}}{t^{2n-1}} \displaystyle{\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1}}(-1)^k\binom{2n-1}{k}x(0)^k x(t)^{2n-1-k}
\end{eqnarray} For simplicity I denote $x(0)=x$ and $x(t)=x_t$, and I apply the expectation operator : 
$$B_t\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty}b_{2n}\frac{A_t^{2n-1}}{t^{2n-1}} \displaystyle{\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1}}(-1)^k\binom{2n-1}{k}x^k \mathbb{E}[x(t)^{2n-1-k}|x]$$
\begin{eqnarray} 
=&B\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty}b_{2n}\frac{A_t^{2n-1}}{t^{2n-1}}\displaystyle{\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1}}(-1)^k\binom{2n-1}{k}x^k \displaystyle{\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}}\frac{t^m}{m!}M^m[x^{2n-1-k}]\\
\end{eqnarray}
Moreover, computations give that  : 
$$\forall(n,k)\in\mathbb{N^2},~M^n(x^k)=\displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor k/2\rfloor}}\alpha_{i,n}(k)x^{2i+\delta_k}$$
with $\delta_k=0$ if $k$ is even, $\delta_k=1$ if not, 
$$\alpha_{i,n+1}(k)=\alpha_{i,n}(k)(2i^2+3i+\delta_k(2i+1))-\alpha_{i+1,n}(k)(2i^2+3i+\delta_k(2i+1))$$
and initial condition : $\alpha_{i,0}(k)=\delta_{i,\lfloor k/2 \rfloor}$, with $\delta_{i,j}$ Kronecker's symbol. We can rearrange the sum : \begin{eqnarray}
S&=&B\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty}b_{2n}\frac{A_t^{2n-1}}{t^{2n-1}}\displaystyle{\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}}\frac{t^m}{m!}\displaystyle{\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1}}(-1)^k\binom{2n-1}{k}x^k \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor k/2\rfloor}}\alpha_{i,m}(2n-1-k)x^{2i+\delta_{k+1}}\\
&=&B\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty}b_{2n}\frac{A_t^{2n-1}}{t^{2n-1}}\displaystyle{\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}}\frac{t^m}{m!}\displaystyle{\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1}}(-1)^k\binom{2n-1}{k}\displaystyle{\sum_{i=\lfloor k/2\rfloor}^{n-1}} x^{2i+1} \alpha_{i,m}(2n-1-k)
\end{eqnarray} In addition $x^{2i+1}\alpha_{i,m}(k)$ is a polynomial in $k$ of degree $d\leq 2m$, therefore its sum over $i$ has a maximal degree of $2m$ too. This implies that $$\forall m< n, ~\displaystyle{\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1}}(-1)^k\binom{2n-1}{k}\displaystyle{\sum_{i=\lfloor k/2\rfloor}^{n-1}} x^{2i+1} \alpha_{i,m}(2n-1-k)=0$$
We are left with :
\begin{eqnarray}
S&=&B_t\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty}b_{2n}\frac{A_t^{2n-1}}{t^{2n-1}}\displaystyle{\sum_{m=n}^{\infty}}\frac{t^m}{m!}\displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}} x^{2i+1}\displaystyle{\sum_{k=0}^{2i+1}}(-1)^k\binom{2n-1}{k} \alpha_{i-\lfloor k/2\rfloor,m}(2n-1-k)
\end{eqnarray} If we take $A\propto t$ and $B\propto \frac{1}{t}$, as $t\to0$, only the term $n=1$ is kept, therefore we obtain a result linear in $x$, which is neglecting all the terms in $x$ coming from the term $M^n(x^k)$. If $A\propto \sqrt{t}$ and $B\propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}$ we keep all the terms $m=n$. This expansion reduces to $$S=\displaystyle{\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}}(-1)^{k+1} a_k C^{2k+1}x(1-x^2)^k$$
where $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor ! \leq a_k \leq n!$ numerically (I calculated the first 100 terms...). Thus this expansion diverges. This seems normal to me (now) because $tanh$ has a finite radius of convergence, and as $t\to 0$ when taking the expected value, $\frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{t}}$ gets larger and larger for some values of $x_t$, those divergences are taken care of by the distribution of $x_t$ which converges to $0$, but the taylor expansion assumes that the argument of $tanh$ is bounded, which is not the case.","['stochastic-processes', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'stochastic-calculus', 'brownian-motion', 'probability']"
284361,Looking for proof that an open set in vector space contains the sum of two open sets.,"Problem: To show that, in a topological vector space, for a given neighborhood of zero $W$, there exist two neighborhoods of zero, $V_1$, $V_2$, whose sum is contained in the first neighborhood, $V_1+V_2\subset W$. Background:
I am reviewing some foundations of functional analysis and was looking at Rudin's book.
Near the beginning he states his theorem 1.10.  Its point is to show that if we start with two disjoint sets in a topological vector space $X$: a compact set K and a closed set C, then there are disjoint open sets containing them. However, I got stuck in a small detail of the proof. He shows first that if $W$ is a neighborhood of $0$ (the zero vector), then there is a neighborhood $U$ of $0$ (the zero vector) which is symmetric (in the sense that $U = - U$) and which satisfies $U + U \subset W$. 
He says: we note that $0+ 0 = 0$, that addition is continuous, and that $0$ therefore has neighborhoods $V_1$, $V_2$ such that $V_1 + V_2 \subset W$. etc... This last statement I do not get. It is clear that $W$ as an open set contains other open sets (for example itself). I can construct, using the continuity of the multiplication by scalars, many other sets properly contained in $W$, contracting and, if needed, taking intersections with $W$. But it is not clear to me how to construct (or show that exist) sets with addition still in $W$. If the vector space is finite or normed or convex this is not hard to do. In the normed case I simply take the balls centered at the origin that are half the size of the least norm of the elements of $W$, but he is stating this in the general topological vector space case. I have not found the generalization of my procedure to the general setting. I also tried looking at all possible pairs of $0-$neighborhoods contained in $W$. If every single pair of open sets adds up to a set with nonempty intersection with $W$ then every pair of sets give a pair of points $x$, $y$ with sum $x+y$ not in $W$. I would like to show this eliminates all points but the origin (but I I am not sure I can do this). Then either we reach a contradiction, or are forced to consider $0+0=0$ as counterexample which works in the case of the discrete topology in $X$. Since the statement is so brief, I am afraid I am missing something. Thank you for your help.","['general-topology', 'vector-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"

284461,Proving dependent choice with initial value from dependent choice without,"A precise statement of the Axiom of Dependent Choice (DC1) is as follows: $$\forall A,F\big[\big(A\ne\emptyset\wedge [F\!:A\to{\cal P}(A)-\{\emptyset\}]\big)\to\exists g\big([g\!:\omega\to A]\wedge(\forall n\in\omega)[g(n+1)\in F(g(n))]\big)\big]$$ In words, this says that for any set $A$, and any function $F$ from $A$ to nonempty subsets of $A$, there exists a sequence $g(n)$ such that $g(n+1)$ is a member of $F(g(n))$ for every $n$. (Note that this can be proven for a sequence of any given finite length by induction without needing any new axioms.) I would like to prove, from this statement of the axiom, the following generalization (which I'll call DC2): $$\begin{align}
\forall x,A,F\big[\big(\!\!&x\in A\wedge [F\!:A\to{\cal P}(A)-\{\emptyset\}]\big)\to \\
&\quad\exists g\big([g\!:\omega\to A]\wedge g(0)=x\wedge(\forall n\in\omega)[g(n+1)\in F(g(n))]\big)\big]
\end{align}$$ The obvious difference is that now the initial value is specified, where previously it was completely unrestricted (except that $g(0)\in A$). My question is how to reconstruct DC2 from DC1. Obviously going the other way is trivial, but if we were after a certain sequence starting from $x$, say ($x,x_1,x_2,\dots$), then in particular any sequence $x_n,x_{n+1},x_{n+2},\dots$ starting in the middle of the sequence is also a possible ""solution to the equation"" provided by the $g$ of DC1, since $F$ is ""memoryless"" and the initial value could be any point in the domain. Now this is alright, because if we actually coincide with a possible solution to the problem with $x$ as initial value (that is, there is some sequence of choices starting at $x$ and containing $x_n$), we can use finite induction to patch the sequence back together. But in general, this is not the case, and there seems to be no way to construct $F$ to restrict the values of $g$ at the beginning, since the initial value is completely unpredictable and the same $F$ is used for all $n$.

284637,"Prove transitivity of $\forall X( X\subseteq A\setminus\{a, b\}\rightarrow(X\cup \{a\}\in\mathcal{F}\rightarrow X\cup\{b\}\in\mathcal{F}))$","This one is from Velleman's ""How to Prove It, 2nd Ed."", exercise 4.3.23. Suppose $A$ is set, and $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(A)$. Let $$R=\{(a,b)\in A\times A : \text{for every } X\subseteq A\setminus\{a, b\}\text{, if } X\cup \{a\}\in\mathcal{F}\text{ then } X\cup\{b\}\in\mathcal{F}))\}$$ Show that $R$ is transitive. First of all, I'm not sure if I read this correctly and if my notation is correct: $$R=\{(a,b)\in A\times A : \forall X( X\subseteq A\setminus\{a, b\}\rightarrow(X\cup \{a\}\in\mathcal{F}\rightarrow X\cup\{b\}\in\mathcal{F}))\}$$ To prove that $R$ is transitive, we need to prove that $$\forall a\in A\;\forall b\in A\;\forall c\in A\;((aRb\wedge bRc) \rightarrow aRc),$$ so for starters we suppose and let all the usual stuff: let $a,b,c\in A$ suppose $aRb \wedge bRc$ expand $aRc$ to $\forall X( X\subseteq A\setminus\{a, c\}\rightarrow(X\cup \{a\}\in\mathcal{F}\rightarrow X\cup\{c\}\in\mathcal{F}))$ let $X$ be arbitrary and suppose $X\subseteq A\setminus\{a,c\}$ suppose $X\cup\{a\}\in\mathcal{F}$ show that $X\cup\{c\}\in\mathcal{F}$ Now Velleman suggests splitting proof to cases: $b\not\in X$ and $b\in X$. Showing that $R$ is transitive for $b\not\in X$ is rather straightforward. All we need to do is to show from $b\not\in X \wedge X\subseteq A\setminus\{a,c\}$ that $X$ is also subset of both $A\setminus\{a,b\}$ and $A\setminus\{b,c\}$, and we just follow assumptions $aRb$ and $bRc$ to conclude $X\cup\{c\}\in\mathcal{F}$. Now we must show transitivity when $b\in X$. For this case Velleman suggests working with $X'=(X\cup\{a\})\setminus\{b\}$ and $X''=(X\cup\{c\})\setminus\{b\}$, and this is the part I totally don't get. Why would using $X'$ and $X''$ work for this proof, and how do actually connect them with all the givens/assumptions? I can see how all this connects after expanding $aRb$ and $bRc$, but I fail to see how this makes a correct proof. So my questions are: is the 1. correct notation for given relation $R$ and how does 4. connect to givens. If there is some other approach, I would be most thankful for any pointers.","['relations', 'proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Note that $e^{x+\delta}-e^{x}=e^{x}(e^{\delta}-1)$. So, for $x$ large enough (so that RHS $>1$), the relation $(\star)$ does not hold.
