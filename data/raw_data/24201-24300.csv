213851,How to find the min and max of $y = x \sin(\ln|x|)$?,"I'm trying to find the minimum and maximum points of the following equation: $y = x \sin(\ln|x|)$ where $x > 0$ which, when graphed, looks something like this: I tried deriving the equation using the chain rule: $$\begin{align}\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{d}{dx}\left(x \cdot \sin(\ln|x|)) \right) \\
& = \sin(\ln|x|) + x \cos(\ln|x|) \frac{1}{x} \\
& = \sin(\ln|x|) + \cos(\ln|x|)
\end{align}$$ ...and setting it equal to zero: $$0 = \sin(\ln|x|) + \cos(\ln|x|)$$ I set $\ln|x|$ equal to $\frac{3\pi}{4}$ or $\frac{7\pi}{4}$ (because using the unit circle, using those two should cause the sin and cos to cancel out), so that $x = e^{{3\pi}/{4}}$ or $x = e^{{7\pi}/{4}}$, but both of those are clearly far more higher then the x-coordinates of the min and max points in the graph. How can I find the min and max x-coordinates of this equation?

213872,"Why are half-open intervals $(a,b]$ ""special"" in probability theory?","I'm learning probability theory and I see the half-open intervals $(a,b]$ appear many times. One of theorems about Borel $\sigma$-algebra is that The Borel $\sigma$-algebra of ${\mathbb R}$ is generated by inervals of the form $(-\infty,a]$, where $a\in{\mathbb Q}$. Also, the distribution function induced by a probability $P$ on $({\mathbb R},{\mathcal B})$ is defined as

F(x)=P((-\infty,x])
$$ Is it because for some theoretical convenience that the half-open intervals are used often in probability theory or are they of special interest?","['probability-theory', 'soft-question']"
213879,What is the curvature 2-form on the associated vector bundle?,"Consider a principal bundle $P\rightarrow M$ and the associated vector bundle $P\times_{\rho}V$ over $M$ such that $(p,v)=(pg^{-1},\rho(g)v)$. The connection on the principal bundle $A$ defines a covariant derivative on $P\times_{\rho}V$ as follows. View a section $s$ on $P\times_{\rho}V$ as a $G$-equivariant map $s^{P}:P\rightarrow V$. This means $S^{P}(pg^{-1})=\rho(g)s^{P}(p)$. This defines a $G$-equivariant homomorphism $s^{P}_{*}$ from $TP$ to $V$. Let $x\in M$ and $v\in TM_{x}$, $H_{A}$ be the horizontal vector bundle in $TP$ defined by $A$. Then for any $p$ be the inverse image of $x$, there is a unique horizontal vector $v_{A}\in H_{A}|_{p}$ being the horizontal lift of $v$ such that $\pi_{*}v_{A}=v$. The covariant derivative $\nabla_{A}$ sends section $v$ to the equivalence of the pair $(p,s^{P}_{*}v_{A})$. A routine exercise showed this is not dependent on the choice of $p$. Taubes claim in his book Differential Geometry that locally we can write the covariderive $\nabla_{A}$ on $P\times_{\rho}V$ as $$x\rightarrow (x,ds_{U}+\rho_{*}(a_{U})s_{U})$$where $\rho_{*}:\mathcal{G}\rightarrow End(V)$ is the differential of $\rho$ at the identity. I do not understand how he derived this identity given the above definition of $\nabla_{A}$. Even if we use the canonical identification $$\phi_{U}^{*}H_{A}=(x,-g^{-1}a_{U}(v)g)\in TU\oplus \mathcal{G}$$ where $\phi_{U}^{*}$ is the local trivialization. I still do not know how to derive the desired identity. Note in particular the connection 1-form on $P$ is given by $$g^{-1}dg+g^{-1}a_{U}g$$ where $a_{U}:U\rightarrow \mathcal{G}\otimes T^{*}M$. However I do not know how to put all these formulas together.",['differential-geometry']
213904,"How to prove the sequence $a_0, a_1, \ldots$ converges iff $a_0, a, a_1, a \ldots$ converges?","Problem Prove that the sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots$ converges to $a$ if and only if the 
  sequence $a_0, a, a_1, a, a_2, a, a_3, \ldots$ converges. Here is my approach: $\Rightarrow$: Since $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots$ converges to $a$, by definition of limit,
            for every $\epsilon > 0$, $\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all 
            $n > N$, then $|a_n - a| < \epsilon$. Now consider the subsequence
            $$a, a, a, a, \ldots$$
            We have that $|a - a| < \epsilon, \, \, \forall \epsilon > 0$, thus
            $a, a, a, a \ldots$ also converges to $a$. Hence,
            $a_0, a, a_1, a, a_2, a, a_3, \ldots$ converges. $\Leftarrow$: Suppose that $a_0, a, a_1, a, a_2, a, a_3, \ldots$ converges to $L$, 
            $L \neq \pm \infty$, by definition of limit, for every $\epsilon > 0$, $\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ 
            such that for all $n > N$, then $|a_n - a| < \epsilon$, thus there must be a sequence
            $$a_{N+1}, a, a_{N+2}, a, a_{N+3}, a, a_{N+4}, \ldots$$
            that is getting closer and closer to $L$. But there is always an alternating 
            $a$ between each $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$, so $L = a$ otherwise $|a_n - L| < \epsilon$ would
            make no sense. Therefore $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots$ converges to $a$. However I still feel it's not complete because all my reasons were based on the definition of infinite sequence. I think there must be a way to give a strong argument for this problem. I wonder if anyone could give me a hint/suggestion on my solution? Thanks.","['limits', 'sequences-and-series', 'analysis']"
213906,"Does the following function on $ \mathbb{R}^{4} $ iterate to $ (0,0,0,0) $ after infinitely many steps?","Define $ f: \mathbb{R}^{4} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{4} $ by
\begin{equation}
\forall (a,b,c,d) \in \mathbb{R}^{4}: \quad f(a,b,c,d) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} (|a - b|,|b - c|,|c - d|,|d - a|).
\end{equation} For many of the 'obvious' $ (a,b,c,d) \in \mathbb{R}^{4} $ that you start with, you will obtain $ {f^{n}}(a,b,c,d) = (0,0,0,0) $ for all $ n \in \mathbb{N} $ large enough. There is also an example where $ {f^{n}}(a,b,c,d) \neq (0,0,0,0) $ for all $ n \in \mathbb{N} $ but still $ \displaystyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} {f^{n}}(a,b,c,d) = (0,0,0,0) $. The example is constructed as follows. Let $ \alpha $ be the real root of the quartic polynomial $ x^{4} - 2 x^{3} + 1 = 0 $ that lies in the interval $ (1,2) $. Then
\begin{align}
f(1,\alpha,\alpha^{2},\alpha^{3}) &= (|1 - \alpha|,|\alpha - \alpha^{2}|,|\alpha^{2} - \alpha^{3}|,|\alpha^{3} - 1|) \\
&= (\alpha - 1,\alpha^{2} - \alpha,\alpha^{3} - \alpha^{2},\alpha^{3} - 1) \\
&= (\alpha - 1) \cdot (1,\alpha,\alpha^{2},\alpha^{3}),
\end{align}
where the last equality is obtained by observing that $ (\alpha - 1) \alpha^{3} = \alpha^{3} - 1 $, which, in turn, is obtained from the quartic polynomial above. It follows that $ {f^{n}}(1,\alpha,\alpha^{2},\alpha^{3}) = (\alpha - 1)^{n} \cdot (1,\alpha,\alpha^{2},\alpha^{3}) $ for all $ n \in \mathbb{N} $. As $ \alpha - 1 \in (0,1) $, we see that $ \displaystyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} {f^{n}}(1,\alpha,\alpha^{2},\alpha^{3}) = (0,0,0,0) $, but clearly, no term is equal to $ (0,0,0,0) $. Is there an example where $ {f^{n}}(a,b,c,d) $ does not converge to $ (0,0,0,0) $? Thanks!",['functions']

213958,Generating Functions: Partitions of Integers,"I'm somewhat stuck on a problem involving using generating functions to determine the number of possible solutions to an equation.  I've attempted to solve the problem by following an example in my textbook, however I am unsure still if I have correctly answered the problem. The problem follows: Find the generating function for the number of integer solutions of: a) $2w + 3x +5y + 7z = n$ where $0 \leq w, x, y, z$ b) $2w + 3x + 5y + 7z = n$ where $ 0 \leq w, 4 \leq x, y, 5 \leq z$ Now, the work I've so far attempted to do is to assign the following functions to each of the terms: $2w = 1+a^2+a^4+a^6+ ..$ $3x = 1 + a^3 + a^6 + a^9+..$ $5y = 1 + a^5 + a^{10} +a^{15} +..$ $7z = 1+a^7+a^{14}+a^{21}+..$ Again, I've only just followed the example in the textbook as I am unsure of what to do.  Could anyone explain what this means? (if it is correct?) Then, I've come up with the generating function by multiplying these values together: $$f(x)=(1+a^2+a^4+..)(1+a^3+a^6+..)(1+a^5+a^10+..)(1+a^7+a^14+..) $$ Now as far as I know, this is a valid generating function.  However, my textbook takes one more step, and I've followed suit: $$f(x)=\frac{1}{1-x^2}*\frac{1}{1-x^3}*\frac{1}{1-x^5}*\frac{1}{1-x^7}$$ I don't understand the step that is taken here, but this is what I have come up with for my final answer to a) . Now for b) , I've taken the equations that I lined out and simply eliminated the earlier terms according to the restrictions on $w,x,y,z$ $2w = 1+a^2+a^4+a^6+ ..$ $3x = a^9+a^{12}+..$ $5y = a^{15} + a^{20}+..$ $7z = a^{28}+a^{35}+..$ If anyone can offer any insight here I would greatly appreciate it.

This is claimed in various places, but a comment on my blog has made me doubt the source I got my proof from (Borceux). Borceux's argument crucially uses the following result: If $A \subset X$ is a closed subspace of a Hausdorff space $X$, then the quotient $X/A$ is Hausdorff. This appears to be false. As far as I can tell, if $X/A$ is Hausdorff, then $A$ and points in $X$ not in $A$ must be separated by open neighborhoods in $X$. But if this is true for every closed subspace $A$ of $X$, then $X$ is necessarily regular, and there are examples of Hausdorff spaces that aren't regular.

In more detail: Say $(G,\mathscr{T})$ is a topological group. It has a left uniformity $\mathscr{L}$ and a right uniformity $\mathscr{R}$.  (It also has a two-sided uniformity $\mathscr{U}$, which is the join of the two.) Now, uniformities on a given set form a complete lattice, so we can also consider the meet of the two, $\mathscr{V}$.  However, the meet of two uniformities that yield the same topology does not necessarily again yield the same topology, so it's possible that $\mathscr{T}'$, the topology coming from $\mathscr{V}$, is coarser than our original topology $\mathscr{T}$. (Obviously, this does not happen if the group is balanced, i.e. $\mathscr{L}=\mathscr{R}$; it also does not happen if $\mathscr{T}$ is locally compact, since the meet of two uniformities yielding the same locally compact topology does again yield the same topology. I think it also can't happen if $G$ embeds in a locally compact group, but I didn't work out all the details there .  Actually, I don't know an actual case where this does happen, so I guess a first question I can ask is, are there any actual examples of this?) So my question is, is $(G,\mathscr{T}')$ again a topological group?  Obviously inversion is continuous, since $\mathscr{V}$ makes inversion uniformly continuous, but it's not clear what would happen with multiplication. If it is a topological group, then we can ask things like, how does $\mathscr{V}$ compare to $\mathscr{L}'$, $\mathscr{R}'$, $\mathscr{U}'$, and $\mathscr{V'}$?

However, there are a lot of sources on the net which claim that the correct solution is the Catalan number : $C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}{2n\choose n} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!\,n!} = \prod\limits_{k=2}^{n}\frac{n+k}{k} \qquad\mbox{ for }n\ge 0$ $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132...$ Which is correct, and why?  Or are they both correct depending on the assumptions you make about the somewhat vague problem statement?","['elementary-set-theory', 'set-partition', 'combinatorics']"

I am trying to show there must be an bijection from $A$ to $\mathbb{N}$. My train of thought so far has been: Assume there is no bijection from $A$ to $\mathbb{N}$. Then $f$ is not surjective. Let $i \in \mathbb{N}$ be the smallest element of $\mathbb{N}$ which is not mapped to $\mathbb{N}$ by $f$. This gives rise to an injective map $f_i:A \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\setminus \{i\}$. If $f_i$ were surjective this means for all $j \in \mathbb{N}\setminus \{i\}$ there exists some $a_j$ in $A$ such that $f_i(a_j)=j$. Define $g:\mathbb{N}\setminus \{i\} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ by $g(n)=n$ for $i<n$ and $g(n)=n-1$ for $n>i$. $g$ is a bijection, and so $g\circ f_i: A \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is a bijection, contradiction our assumption no such function exists. Thus $f_i$ cannot be surjective. Repeating this process shows that there is no bijective map $$f_P:A \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\setminus \{P\},$$ where $P$ is a finite set of elements of $\mathbb{N}$.

After searching around, I picked up Halmos' Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces and Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right . I've noticed that they state theorems which they prove by a method which I would describe as ""algorithmic"". For example, verbatim from Axler (although Halmos is very similar): Theorem: In a finite-dimensional vector space, the length of every lin. ind. tuple is $\leq$ to the length of every spanning tuple
  of vectors. Proof : Suppose that ($u_1$, ... $u_m$) is lin. ind. in $\mathcal{V}$ and ($w_1$, ... $w_n$) spans $\mathcal{V}$. We need to prove $m \leq n$. We do so through
  the multi-step process described below.... Step 1 : The tuple $(w_1, ... w_n)$ spans $\mathcal{V}$, and thus adjoining any vector produces a linearly dependent tuple. In particular, the tuple $(u_1, w_1, ... w_n)$ is linearly independent. Thus, by the linear dependence lemma, we can remove one of the $w$'s so that the n -tuple B consisting of $u_1$ and the remaining $w$'s spans $\mathcal{V}$. Step j : The n -tuple B from step $j-1$ spans $\mathcal{V}$, and thus adjoining any vector to it produces a linearly dependent tuple. In particular, the $(n+1)$-tuple obtained by adjoining $u_j$ to B , placing it just after $u_1,...u_{j-1},$ is linearly dependent. By the linear dependence lemma (2.4), one of the vectors in this tuple is in the span of the previous ones.... We can remove that $w$ from $B$ so that the new $n$-tuple $B$ consisting of $u_1, ... u_j$ and the remaining $w$'s spans $\mathcal{V}$. After step $m$, we have added all the $u$'s and the process stops. If at any step we added a $u$ and had no more $w$'s to remove, then we would have a contradiction. Thus there must be at least as many $w$'s as $u$'s. I take issue with the level of rigor of ""algorithmic"" proof. Although I think these proofs might be amenable to treatment by induction, I'm not sure how to carry it out. As they stand, although I get the intuition, they don't really convince me. If I had to be precise about what bothers me, I'd say that the actual sets resulting from each step of the operation aren't stated explicitly, and I'm not sure how these sets are being ordered/indexed (they play fast and loose there).

Let $x$ be a limit point of $C \setminus U$.  It should follow that if $C \setminus U$ is closed, then $x \in (C \setminus U)$.  Now we know that $\forall$ regions $R$ containing $x$, there is a nonempty intersection with $C \setminus U$.  Also, $x$ cannot be a point of the interior of $U$ because any intersection with a region containing it would be empty, which wouldn't be in accordance to our assumption that $x$ is a limit point of $C \setminus U$.  So $x$ is not in the interior of $U$ or $x \notin U$.  This would mean that $x \in (C \setminus U)$ and thus $C \setminus U$ is closed.

I am able to prove $\lim \limits _{k\rightarrow \infty} \int \limits _E f_k \leq \int \limits _E f$ but am struggling to prove the second condition. My idea was to use fatou's lemma to get 
$$
\int \limits _E \liminf \limits _{k\rightarrow \infty} f_k = \int \limits _E \lim \limits _{k\rightarrow \infty} f_k = \int \limits _E f \leq \liminf \limits _{k\rightarrow \infty} \int \limits _E f_k = \lim \limits _{k\rightarrow \infty} \int \limits _E f_k
$$
but I don't know how to show $\liminf \limits _{k\rightarrow \infty} f_k = \lim \limits _{k\rightarrow \infty} f_k$, besides showing $\liminf \limits _{k\rightarrow \infty} f_k = \limsup \limits _{k\rightarrow \infty} f_k$ . Any ideas on how I could finish this? Also, is my approach wrong? Could I do it a better way?",['real-analysis']
215018,Direct limit of $\mathbb{Z}$-homomorphisms,"What is the direct limit of the following sequence of $\mathbb{Z}$-homomorphisms (as groups)? $$ \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{2} \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{3} \mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{5} \mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{7} \mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{11} \mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{13}\cdots $$ Here the label $p$ indicates multiplication by $p$, and the sequence is just the sequence of primes. Is there an easy description of this limit? Would we get a different limit if we take a subsequence of the primes, or the sequence of primes squared?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups']"
215034,"rate of convergence of mean ,variance & skewness estimators","We are asked a question which of mean,variance or skewness converges faster. At first I thought it was straight forward answer: mean->variance->skewness. But I am not sure anymore because I read somewhere standard error of the mean estimator is only slightly smaller.
std_error_of_mean=sigma/sqrt(n) std_error_of_varaince=sqrt(2) * (sigma^2)/sqrt(n) So it is only sqrt(2) times better ? I am not a statician, so can some one please explain what the general pattern is for standard error of higher order moments. Also are there equations for the rate of convergence of moments, so that I could compare with observation.

215038,Why this topological space is not a topological manifold?,"I'm having troubles to prove that the following space is not a topological manifold: Let $r:S^1\to S^1$ be a rotation of $\frac{2\pi}{3}$, i. e., $r(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)=\left(\cos\theta+\frac{2\pi}{3},\sin\theta+\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)$, such that $X=B^2/\sim$, where the partition is given by
$P=\{x\}$ if $|x|\lt1$ and $P=\{x,r(x),r^2(x)\}$ if $|x|=1$. So this is my attempt: Let $x\in X$ be a point in the boundary of $B^2$, the neighborhood of $x$ in $B^2$ is an open set $U$ of $B^2$ with $r(U)$ and $r^2 (U)$.
My strategy is to prove that this neighborhood is not homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$, anyone can help me in this part? Thanks","['general-topology', 'manifolds', 'algebraic-topology']"
