1911022,Understanding the behaviour of order statistics of samples of uniform distribution,"Let $P$ denote any continuous distribution with density $p$ on $[0,1]$ and $Q$ the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$ whose density is $1$.

Any help towards this would be appreciated. The reason why I encountered this is because of the observation that if I use a Gaussian Kernel Density estimator with weights $w_i$ and $\tilde{w}_i$ respectively, both the weights are able to fit the pdf $p(x)$ perfectly across a range of distributions $P$ and $Q$.

1911042,Real life birthday paradox.,"This question is inspired by the Birthday paradox. Suppose we have a sample space $S$ of $n$ elements. Is there a probability distribution $\mu$ on $S$ so that $$P(\text{you pick $k$ elements of $S$, according to $\mu$, without repeating}) < P(\text{you pick $k$ elements of $S$ uniformly, without repeating})$$ To avoid triviality assume $1 < k < n$. (I assume the answer is no, I tried checking by hand, but I got stuck). The reason I ask, is that I am going to teach the Birthdng Paradox in class on Friday, and, of course, I'm going to assume that a person's birthday is uniformly distributed throughout the year. This is empirically false, and I guess that the fact that there is a bias towards certain days increases the likelihood of a shared birthday.

For any finite $n$ the value of $g(n)$ is False which leads me to believe that the limit is False but I’m sure about this. Possibly this depends on the domain of $f$. If the domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$ then is the limit different to the case when the domain of $f$ is  $\mathbb{N}$?","['discrete-calculus', 'limits']"

1911128,Closed line integral gradient relation proof,"Prove the following relation: $$ \oint f \vec{\bigtriangledown}g \cdot d\vec{l} = -\oint g \vec{\bigtriangledown}f \cdot d\vec{l} $$ where f, g are scalar functions. I've tried a lot of work, but can't seem to figure this relation out.
I initially tried using stokes theorem thinking it would give me some kind of result but I ended up just proving the relation: $$ \oint f \vec{\bigtriangledown}g \cdot d\vec{l} = \int_S ((\vec{\bigtriangledown}f)\times(\vec{\bigtriangledown}g))$$ Which is correct, apparently, but I still want to prove the top relation. I tried taking the gradient of g, and distributing f as a scalar, but I can't see any relation that would re-arrange the del operator. $$\oint f \vec{\bigtriangledown}g \cdot d\vec{l} = \oint \langle f \frac{\partial g}{\partial x},f\frac{\partial g}{\partial y},f\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}\rangle \cdot\langle dxdydz\rangle  $$ Everything I've seen related to closed line integrals states that it is equivalent to 0, but I just don't see how to get this result. I've even thought of using the gradient theorem, by replacing with g, and distributing f (this is the general equation): $$ \int_{a}^{b} (\vec{\bigtriangledown}f)\cdot d\vec{l} = f(\vec{b})-f(\vec{a}) $$ Any help would be appreciated.",['multivariable-calculus']

Let Q(x) be some other polynomial in $x$, also with integer coefficients. Prove that 
$$
\prod_i Q(r_i) \in \Bbb{Z}
$$ For example, if $P(x) = x^5+2x^2+1$ and $Q(x) = x^2-2$ then $\prod Q(r_i) = -7$. I am pretty sure it is true, because you can express each term in the product of those polynomials in a form like $$
\sum_{i<j<\ldots <n} r_i^{p_1} r_j^{p_2} \ldots
$$
and laboriously express those sums as sums of  products of combinations of the roots that match expressions determined by the (integer) coefficients of $P(x)$.  But making that constructive proof anything more than hand-waving seems  difficult. I wonder if any ideals in the theory of rings, for instance, can make this proposition easier to prove.

1911196,The Whitney sphere immersion,"The standard unit sphere $S^n = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb R^n \times \mathbb R  \mid \lvert x \rvert^2 + y^2  = 1\}$ can be immersed inside $\mathbb C^n$ through the formula $(x,y) \mapsto (1+iy)x$. This is a Lagrangian immersion with a double point at the poles $(0,\pm 1)$. In the special case $n = 1$, this yields a figure 8 in the plane. What is an easy way to see that this formula does indeed yield an immersion? The case $n = 1$ is easy enough, but things get ugly for arbitrary $n$. I've tried using generalized spherical coordinates, but the matrix of the differential in these coordinates is nasty, and it's unclear to me why it has maximal rank. Alternatively, viewed as a map $\mathbb R^{n+1} \to \mathbb R^{2n}$, the immersion has a nice enough differential, but these rectangular coordinates are not adapted to the tangent bundle of the sphere.","['symplectic-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"

Notation: we work over an algebraically closed field $k$, and $Z(S)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^n$ denotes the zero locus of a subset $S\subseteq k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. Given Zariski closed subsets $X_i,Y_i\in\mathbb{A}^1$ for $1\leq i \leq n$, I'd like to show that $\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}X_i \times Y_i$ is Zariski closed in $\mathbb{A}^1\times \mathbb{A}^1=\mathbb{A}^2$ (where we identify these two sets in the obvious way). Attempt at a solution: it suffices to show that $X_1\times Y_1$ is closed, as a finite union of closed sets is closed. Also, we know $X_1=Z(U)$ and $Y_1=Z(W)$ for some subsets $U,W\subseteq k[x]$.

1911219,Where is the logical flaw in my combinations answer?,"I encountered the following problem in DeGroot and Schervish's Probability and Statistics : Selecting Baked Goods. You go to a bakery to select some baked goods for a dinner party. You need to choose a total of $12$ items. The baker has seven different types of items from which to choose, with lots of each type available. How many different boxfuls of $12$ items are possible for you to choose? Here we wlil not distinguish the same collection of $12$ items arranged in different orders in the box. This is an example of unordered sampling with replacement because we can (indeed we must) choose the same type of item more than once, but we are not distinguishing the same items in different orders. There are $\binom{7+12-1}{12} = 18{,}564$ different boxfuls. My impression would be that for each of the $12$ spots, any one of the types of items could be chosen, i.e. $7$ to the $12$th power. Then, we would just divide out the different orderings of the same group, leading to the answer $7^{12} \,/\,12!$. What's wrong with my intuition?",['combinatorics']
1911231,Riemann-Roch equation for proper integral curves (not necessarily non-singular!),"In Qing Liu - Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves , chapter 7.3, Theorem 3.26 the author states the Theorem of Riemann-Roch as follows: Let $f: X \rightarrow \text{Spec }k$ be a projective curve over a field $k$. Then for any Cartier divisor $D \in \text{Div}(X)$, we have
    $$\dim_kH^0(X,\mathcal{O}_x(D)) - \dim_k H^0(X,\omega_f \otimes \mathcal{O}_x(-D)) = \deg D +1 -p_a.$$ Here $\omega_f$ denotes the 1-dualizing sheaf for $f$ . On the next page, in Remark 3.33, he points out that if $X$ is a local complete intersection and integral curve, then one obtains 
$$\dim_k H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_x(D)) = \deg D +1 -p_a(X)$$ if the degree of $D$ is sufficiently large. That equation is the one I'm looking for, except that I want to drop the assumption that $X$ is a local complete intersection curve . Thus the question: Let $X$ be a proper integral curve over the field $k$. Does the equation $$\dim_k H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_x(D)) = \deg D +1 -p_a(X)$$ hold for any Cartier divisor $D$ on $X$ with $\deg D \geq 2p_a(X)-1$? Thoughts: The desired equation holds in the case of a l.c.i. curve since then the dualizing sheaf is invertible and then we can work with the degree of $\omega_f \otimes \mathcal{O}_x(-D)$, i.e. for $\deg D$ large enough, $\omega_f \otimes \mathcal{O}_x(-D)$ has negative degree and thus no global sections. Maybe there is another way to show that this is the case if $\deg D$ increases. Another approach is to think about the first cohomology term $\dim_k H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D))$ instead of $\dim_k H^0(X,\omega_f \otimes \mathcal{O}_x(-D))$ (i.e. avoid using the dualizing sheaf at all) and to show it vanishes for $\deg D$ large enough. One possible approach: Assume $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$ to be a proper integral morphism and let $\mathbb{P}^1 = U_0 \cup U_\infty$ be an open affine cover where $x$ is regular on $U_0$ and $1/x$ regular on $U_\infty$. Let $V_0 = \pi^{-1}(U_0)$, $V_\infty = \pi^{-1}(U_\infty)$, then $C = V_0 \cup V_\infty$ is an open affine cover of $C$ where $V_0$ is the open subset where the function $x$ is regular and analogously $V_\infty$ the open subset where the function $1/x$ is regular. Following the definitions of Cech cohomology, $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D)) = 0$ if and only if $$\mathcal{O}_X(D)(V_0 \cap V_\infty) = \text{im}(d^0:C^0(\mathcal{O}_X(D))\rightarrow C^1(\mathcal{O}_X(D)))$$ where the latter is $$\left\{ (a_1 - a_0)_{V_0 \cap V_\infty} \mid (a_0,a_1) \in C^0(\mathcal{O}_X(D)) = \mathcal{O}_X(D)(V_0) \times \mathcal{O}_X(D)(V_\infty) \right\}.$$ Then all this provides the equivalence $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D)) = 0$ if and only if $$\forall \gamma \in \mathcal{O}_X(D)(V_0\cap V_\infty) \exists (a_0,a_1) \in \mathcal{O}_X(D)(V_0) \times \mathcal{O}_X(D)(V_\infty): \gamma = (a_1-a_0)_{V_0 \cap V_\infty}.$$ Can you show that the latter is true? I found no reference for this equation with this few assumptions, but if you know one, please let me know. Further I'd be grateful for any kind of help. Edit: It would be sufficient if there is a statement as follows: Let $f: X \rightarrow \text{Spec }k$ be a projective curve over a field $k$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertible sheaf on $X$ and $\mathcal{F}$ an arbitrary quasi-coherent sheaf on $X$. Then if $\deg \mathcal{L}$ is positive enough, it would imply $$\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{F}) = 0.$$ Hence if anybody knows a reference for this (or even a proof) please let me know or post it!

1911265,Proof of Peano's existence theorem for ODEs,"Theorem : Given a continuous function $f:(a,b)\times (c,d)\to \mathbb R$, the problem $$\begin{cases} y'(t)=f(t,y(t))\\
y(t_0)=y_0\end{cases}$$
has a local solution in some neighbourhood of a given point $t_0$. A ""standard"" proof of Peano existence theorem makes use of the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem. I suspect that the following proof, which doesn't, is therefore wrong. But where? Consider, instead of the open rectangle $(a,b)\times (c,d)$, a closed rectangle contained in it (since the thesis is local, this makes no difference), say $[a',b']\times[c',d']$. Consider polynomials $P_n(t,y)$ which converge uniformly to $f$ on the closed rectangle. These exist because of the Weiertrass theorem.
Now the problems $$\begin{cases} y_n'(t)=P_n(t,y_n(t))\\
y_n(t_0)=y_0\end{cases}$$ have a unique global solution in $[a,b]$, since $P_n$ is a polynomial, hence globally Lipschitz on the rectangle (recall that globally Lipschitz implies global existence by gluing local solutions). Now we say that the function $P_n$ has an uniform limit $f$, and therefore the functions $t\to y_n'(t)$ have an uniform limit, which we shall denote by $g(t)$. (This is the point which I am less sure of.) Now we have a sequence of functions $y_n$ which take the same value in $t_0$, which are $C^1([a',b;])$ and whose derivatives converge uniformly to a function $g$. Therefore a limit for $y_n$ exists, is differentiable in a neighbourhood of $t_0$ and its derivative is $g$. (This is a theorem of elementary analysis: $f_n(a)\to l$ for a given $a$, $f'_n\to g$ uniformly, then $f_n$ has a limit $f$ which satisfies $f(a)=l$, $f'=g$.)

I have completed this exercise by first showing that $\displaystyle \Big( \int |K(x,y)||f(y)| dy \Big)^2 \leq A w(x) \int |K(x,y)||f(y)|^2w(y)^{-1}dy$, and then use this inequality to argue that $\displaystyle ||Tf||^2 \leq \int Aw(x) \int |K(x,y)||f(y)|^2w(y)^{-1} dydx = \int A|f(y)|^2 w(y)^{-1} \int |K(x,y)|w(x) dxdy \leq A^2 ||f||^2$. Now I want use a similar argument to show the following statement in $L^p$: Let $(X,\mu)$ and $(Y,\nu)$ be two finite measure spaces, and $K(x,y)$ measurable on $X \times Y$. 
  Let $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, and let $\displaystyle A = \sup_x \int_Y |K(x,y)|d\nu$, $\displaystyle B = \sup_y \int_X |K(x,y)|d\mu$. Define $T \colon L^p(Y) \to L^p(X)$ by $\displaystyle Tf(x) = \int_Y K(x,y) f(y) d\nu$. If $A,B < \infty$, then $||T|| \leq \max\{A,B\}$. The function $w(x)$ in the previous exercise just becomes $w=1$ here.
I use Holder's inequality to say that $\displaystyle \Big( \int_Y |K(x,y)||f(y)| d\nu \Big)^p \leq \int_Y |K(x,y)| d\nu \cdot \Big( \int_Y |K(x,y)||f(y)|^q d\nu \Big)^{p/q} \leq A\Big( \int_Y |K(x,y)||f(y)|^q d\nu \Big)^{p/q}$. In the next step, I would like to use Fubini's theorem to interchange the order of integration, just as in the previous exercise. But the exponent on the integral is preventing me from doing that.

1911427,Is $f(C)$ a convex set if $f$ and $C$ are convex?,"The complete claim is, Let $F$ be an ordered field and $\bar F=F\bigcup\{+\infty,-\infty\}$ . Let $f:A \to \bar F$ be a convex map from affine space $(A,V)$ to affine space $(F,F)$ , then $f(C)$ is a convex set if $C$ is convex. Here $F$ can be treated as $\Bbb R$ except for that we do not use its topology and metric. $A$ is a point set, and $V$ is a vector space. A convex function is defined using epigraph, $f$ is a convex set if its epigraph $\text{epi} f=\{(x,y)\in A\times F:y\ge f(x)\}$ is a convex set. I am not sure if this claim is right but it seems so. I find difficulty in proving it. The following is an attempt, but no contradiction is found. If $f(C)$ is not convex, then there exists $y_1,y_2\in f(C)$ st. $y_1>y_2$ and $\theta y_1 + (1-\theta) y_2 \notin f(C)$ for some $\theta \in (0,1)$ .

1911440,Strong Counterexample to MVT on Q,"A well-known application of the MVT is to prove that any $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f'= 0$ is constant. But of course, the MVT relies fundamentally on the properties of $\mathbb{R}$, and in particular does not hold in $\mathbb{Q}$. A standard counter-example is the function $f :\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ defined by $ f(x)=0 $ if $ x <\sqrt{2}$, and
$f(x)=1$ if $ x > \sqrt{2}$, for this function is locally constant. There are several ways of thinking about the difference between $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ : $\mathbb{R}$ is connected while $\mathbb{Q}$ is totally disconnected, closed bounded intervals are compact in $\mathbb{R}$, but not in $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the least upper bound axiom, $\mathbb{Q}$ does not. Now, I wanted to see how far one could push this counterexample - is there a function $f :\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ such that $f'=0$ and $f$ is strictly increasing? Clearly, any slight modification of the usual counterexample where $f$ is locally constant will not do. Also, one can show that if $f$ is uniformly differentiable with derivative zero, it must be constant, even in $\mathbb{Q}$, so I knew I was looking for non-uniformly differentiable but still differentiable $f$. Eventually, I came up with a construction, albeit not a very explicit one: the idea is that, since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, one can enumerate it $q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, \cdots$, and then define $f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ inductively and recursively. If one could define $f$ in such a way that $ \forall \ q_{n} \in \mathbb{Q} \ \exists \ c_{n} \in \mathbb{Q} : \forall \ x \in \mathbb{Q} \ |f(x)-f(q_{n})| \leq c_{n}|x-q_{n}|^2$, and $f$ is strictly increasing, we would be done. The recursive definition essentially defines $f(q_{n+1})$, after having defined $f(q_{1}),f(q_{2}),f(q_{3}), \cdots , f(q_{n})$, in such a way that these inequalities hold and $f$ is strictly increasing, and at each step the new $c_{n}$ is chosen large enough so that these inequalities do not become incompatible at subsequent steps ( I am willing to provide more details of this construction if asked). Note that, as $n \to \infty$, we must have $c_{n} \to \infty$, so that $f$ is not uniformly differentiable. Interestingly, the only key fact about $\mathbb{Q}$ used in the construction is that it is countable, so in a sense the construction provides a proof that $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable, given the MVT. While the construction works, it is not very simple nor explicit, which is perhaps to be expected, and the function must be evaluated point by point in the order given by the enumeration of $\mathbb{Q}$. So I was wondering if anyone else knows or can come up with a simpler construction of a function
$ f : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ such that $f'=0$ and $f$ is strictly increasing. Any thoughts and ideas are welcome. Edit: I've asked the same question on MO: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/248913/strong-counterexample-to-mvt-on-q","['real-analysis', 'calculus']"
1911457,Number of Partial Surjective Functions from X to Y,"The number of total surjective functions from $X$ to $Y$ is known to be $T = y!\left\{{x \atop y}\right\}$, with $|X|=x, |Y|=y$. However, I am interested in the number $P$ of partial surjective functions, that is, elements of $X$ do not necessarily map to an element of $Y$. An approach I was thinking about was that you can map each partial function $f:X \to Y$ to a total function $f': X \to Y \cup \{\epsilon\}$, where $\forall x \in X \setminus \operatorname{dom}(f), f'(x) = \epsilon$. That is, extending the domain of the partial function such that elements undefined through $f$ map to a special element in $f'$. Using this, we can say:
$$P = (y+1)!\left\{{x \atop y+1}\right\} + T.$$ The added $T$ is to count the partial functions that happen to be total. The first term does not count them since $\left\{{x \atop y+1}\right\}$ counts the number of ways to partition a set of $x$ objects into $y+1$ non-empty subsets. Interrestingly enough, by rearranging a bit, we also have: $$P = y!\left\{{x+1 \atop y+1}\right\}.$$ Is the reasoning correct?

1911460,Parabolic Maximum Principle on Geometric Flows,"I am trying to understand the main aspects of geometric flows. The parabolic maximum principle (PMP) plays an important role to bound geometric quantities, however, I haven't found a reference in which they show (for beginners) how to apply it and they only mention that it is an application of the PMP. To be precise, in Huisken and Ilmanen's paper ""The inverse mean curvature flow and the Riemannian Penrose inequality"" ( https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1090349447 ) they show that the evolution of the mean curvature is given by (equation 1.3):
$$\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}H=\dfrac{1}{H^2}\Delta H-2\dfrac{|D H|^2}{H^3} -\dfrac{1}{H}\text{Ric}(\nu,\nu)-\dfrac{1}{H}|A|^2$$
and they mention the following:
""This equation is cause for optimism, because in view of the fact that $|A|^2 \geq \dfrac{H^2}{n−1}$, the parabolic maximum principle yields the curvature bound
$$\max\limits_{N_t} H^2 \leq \max_{N_0} H^2+C.$$
as long as the Ricci curvature is bounded below and the flow remains smooth."" It seems that the reason could be that from the evolution of H,
$$\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}H \leq \dfrac{1}{H^2}\Delta H+\frac{|c|}{H}, $$
which calls for an application of the PMC, however from the usual statements of the PMC I have seen, I am not sure how to deal with the $1/H^2$. I also tried writing the evolution of $H^2$, but I got similar issues. To add up, the constant $C$ also puzzles me, since all the conclusions or uses I have seem of the PMP, point out to a bound of the type $\max\limits_{N_0} H^2$ (no constant).","['maximum-principle', 'mean-curvature-flows', 'differential-geometry']"

The function is defined as the limit of: $$f_1(x)=x$$ $$f_2(x)=x+x^2$$ $$f_3(x)=x+(x+x^3)^2$$ etc. For $|x|$ 'small enough' we have a finite limit $f(x)$, but I'm not really interested in it right now. What I'm interested in - if we consider the function to be represented by a (formal) power series, then we can expand the terms $f_n$ and study the sequence of coefficients. It appears to converge as well (i.e. the coefficients for first $N$ powers of $x$ stop changing after a while). For example, we have the correct first $50$ coefficients for $f_{10}$: $$(a_n)=$$ 0,1,1,0,2,0,1,6,0,6,6,24,15,26,48,56,240,60,303,504,780,1002,1776,3246,3601,7826,7500,18980,26874,38130,56196,99360,153636,210084,390348,486420,900428,1310118,2064612,3073008,4825138,7558008,11428162,18596886,26006031,43625940,65162736,100027728,152897710,242895050,365185374 I say they are correct, because they are the same up until $f_{15}$ at least (checked with Mathematica). Is there any other way to define this integer sequence? What can we say about the rate of growth of this sequence, the existence of small $a_n$ for large $n$, etc.? (see numerical estimations below) Does it become monotone after $a_{18}=60$? (Actually, $a_{27}=7500$ is smaller than the previous term as well) (see numerical estimations below) Are $a_0,a_3,a_5,a_8$ the only zero members of the sequence? (appears to be yes, see numerical estimations below) The sequence is not in OEIS (which is not surprising to me). Edit Following Winther's lead I computed the ratios of successive terms for $f_{70}$ until $n=35 \cdot 69=2415$: $$c_n=\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}$$ And also the differences between the successive ratios: $$d_n=c_n-c_{n+1}$$ We have: $$c_{2413}=1.428347168$$ $$c_{2414}=1.428338038$$ I conjecture that $c_{\infty}=\sqrt{2}$, but I'm not sure. After much effort, I computed $$c_{4949}=1.4132183695$$ Which seems to disprove my conjecture. The nearby values seem to agree with this. $$c_{4948}=1.4132224343 \\ 
c_{4947}=1.4132265001$$ But the most striking thing - just how much the sequence stabilizes after the first $200-300$ terms. How can we explain this behaviour? Why does the sequence start with more or less 'random' terms, but becomes monotone for large $n$?

It seems to me that matrix multiplication and addition are used for completely different purposes. The typical application of matrix multiplication is to matrices that represent a system of linear equations, but the typical application of matrix addition is to matrices that represent quantities of variables that have some 2 dimensional relation to eachother. An  example of the latter is a matrix who's row represents gender, and who's column represents an age group, and where each entry represents the amount of people in that age group and gender. This example does not represent a system of linear equations, so matrix multiplication seems to be meaningless.

Context to aid answering the question is provided below Details Say we have a 4x4 square with 16 cells. We lay this square on the on a beach and measure the presence of animals in each cell. Weekly Statistics We fill in each cell with the following rule If a animal is present in a cell, cell value = 1 if the cell is empty (animal does NOT appear), cell value = 0 This results in a cell like so, Monthly Totals We repeat this each week of each month. We add up the weekly quadrats to create  month summary, where each cell has a number between 0 and 4. 0 = no animal present in any of the weeks 1 = animal present in 1/4 of the weeks 2 = animal present in 2/4 of the weeks 3 = animal present in 3/4 of the weeks 4 = animal was present in every week value count

Two equivalent definitions for $B_t(x)$ with $|x|<1$ : $$B_t(x):=-t\zeta(1-t,x)$$ or \begin{align*}  
B_t(x+1):=&-\frac{2\Gamma(1+t)}{(2\pi)^t}\cos \left( \frac{\pi t}{2} \right)  \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{(2\pi x)^{2k}}{(2k)!}\zeta(t-2k) \\

With https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238803313_Bernoulli_numbers_and_polynomials_of_arbitrary_complex_indices , page 86, Theorem 5, using equation (11) with the lower limit of $1$ instead of $0$ ( $k=1$ instead of $k=0$ )  the formula for the sum of fractional powers is $$S_x(t):=\sum\limits_{k=1}^x k^t =\frac{B_{t+1}(x+1)-B_{t+1}(1)}{t+1}$$ with $x\in\mathbb{N}_0$ and $t\in\mathbb{R}_0^+$ (general: $t$ can be complex but I don’t need this possibility here). The right side may be differentiated by $x$ and therefore one can write $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} S_x(t)=B_t(x+1)$$ On the other hand differentiated by $t$ and the definition with $M_x(t):=\prod\limits_{k=1}^x k^{k^t} $ it's $$\ln M_x(t)=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}S_x(t)=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{B_{t+1}(x+1)-B_{t+1}(1)}{t+1}$$ Together one gets (by exchanging the derivatives, which is possible here) $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}B_t(x+1)=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\ln M_x(t)$$ Note : Perhaps this equation becomes a bit clearer if one looks at $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Delta B_t(x)=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Delta \ln M_{x-1}(t)$$ with $\Delta B_t(x):=B_t(x+1)-B_t(x)=tx^{t-1}$ and $\Delta \ln M_x(t):=\ln M_{x+1}(t)-\ln M_x(t)=(x+1)^t\ln(x+1)$ . The problem now is : I need a formula for $\ln M_x(t)$ or $M_x(t)$ , independend of $B_t(x)$ (otherwise it's a trivial identity), where $x$ and $t$ are variable. It could be a series of (more or less known) functions of $x$ (or perhaps $x$ and $t$ ) which becomes a sum/term for $t\in\mathbb{N}$ - similar to $B_t(x)$ . Alternative: To proof that the two definitions above for $B_t(x)$ are indeed equivalent (a link to the literatur is enough). Note : The Euler-MacLaurin-formula can perhaps give a formula for $\ln M_x(t)$ . Does someone know a link, where this is computed ?

$$ for $|x|<1$ and $t>0$ . It is known, that $\frac{d}{dx}\ln M_x(1)=-\ln\sqrt{2\pi}+\frac{1}{2}+x+\ln\Gamma(1+x)$ . Using $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}B_t(x)|_{t=1}=\frac{d}{dx}\ln M_{x-1}(1)$$ and derivating the fourier series of $B_t(x)$ (above) by $t$ and having regard to $(\ln\Gamma(1+t))'|_{t=1}=1-\gamma$ one gets $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{\frac{\ln k}{k}}\sin \left( 2\pi kx \right) =\frac{\pi}{2}\left( \ln \frac{\Gamma \left( x \right)}{\Gamma \left( 1-x \right)}-\left( 1-2x \right) \left( \gamma +\ln \left( 2\pi \right) \right) \right)

\ln M_x(m)&=H_m\frac{B_{m+1}(x+1)- B_{m+1}(1)}{m+1}+\ln Q_m(x)+ \\
&+\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\binom{m}{k}(-x)^{m-k}\sum_{v=0}^k \binom{k}{v}x^{k-v}(\ln A_v -\ln Q_v(x))
\end{align*} The definition of $Q_m(x)$ is (4.2) on page 13, it’s something like a modified Multiple-Gamma-Function. $\frac{d}{dx}\ln M_x(m)$ can be computed by using the differentiation rule (4.4) for the equation above. Now one gets with $B_t(1)=-t\zeta(1-t)$ and $\frac{d}{dt}B_t(1)|_{t=m}=\frac{d}{dx}\ln M_x(m)|_{x=0}$ the equation chain $$\frac{B_{m+1}(1)}{m+1}+(m+1)\zeta’(-m)= \zeta(-m)+(m+1)\zeta’(-m)=(-t\zeta(1-t))’$$ $$=\frac{d}{dt}B_t(1)|_{t=m+1}=\frac{d}{dx}\ln M_x(m+1)|_{x=0}=H_{m+1}B_{m+1}(1)-(m+1)\ln A_m$$ and this result dissolved for $\zeta’(-m)$ and took into account that $H_{m+1}-\frac{1}{m+1}=H_m$ and $H_m B_{m+1}(1)=H_m B_{m+1}$ for $m\in\mathbb{N}_0$ one gets Adamchik’s result. Most simple solution for proofing $\displaystyle \frac{\partial}{\partial t}B_t(x+1)=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\ln M_x(t)$ by using the 2nd development  of G Cab with the

\frac{\partial}{\partial t}B_t(x+1)&= \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\zeta(-t,1)-\zeta(-t,x+1)) \\

$$\mathbb{E}(X) = \mathbb{E}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i \right) =  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{E}\left( Y_i \right) = n \cdot \mu.$$
Moreover,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\operatorname{Var}(X) &=& \operatorname{Var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i \right) \\
&=&  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \operatorname{Var}\left( Y_i \right) + 2\cdot\left(\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} \operatorname{Cov}(Y_i,Y_j) \right) \\
&=&  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \operatorname{Var}\left( Y_i \right) + 2\cdot\left(\frac{ n(n -1 )}{2}\right) \cdot C \\
&=& n \cdot \sigma^2 + n(n -1)\cdot C\\
&=& n\cdot ( \sigma^2 + (n-1)\cdot C),
\end{eqnarray*}
where we have used the properties of the variance, and the fact that for any $i\neq j$, the variables $Y_i,Y_j$ follow the same distribution,  and so $\operatorname{Cov}(Y_i,Y_j)=C$ for all $i\neq j$, for some constant $C$. Question 1: Is this right? I have an uneasy feeling about assuming that all the covariances equal a constant C. Is there some additional hypothesis on the original random variables $Y_1,\ldots,Y_n$ that one needs to assume so that the covariance   $\operatorname{Cov}(Y_i,Y_j)=C$ independent of the chosen $i\neq j$? Question 2: Also, is $C=\operatorname{Cov}(Y_i,Y_j)=\operatorname{Cov}(Y_i,Y_i)=\sigma^2$? Thanks!","['statistics', 'probability', 'variance', 'covariance']"

1912242,Stopping rule for quality control problem,"Problem: Suppose I have a production process that yields output in batches of $n$ items. For each batch, I can test whether they are of good or bad quality. Let $q_i\in\{1,0\}$  be the quality of tested item $i$. If more than half of the items are ‘bad’, the batch should be discarded. In other words: the batch should be discarded if the average quality of items is $\bar{q}(n)<0.5$. Suppose testing is sequential (i.e. you learn the quality of items one at the time), and each test is a random draw from a Bernoulli distribution with unknown mean $p$. I would like to know when to stop testing items in a batch, in order to decide whether to discard it without testing all items,  and yet be statistically confident that the outcome (discard vs not discard) is the same as the one that would have been reached if all items had been tested. What I currently have: If I knew $p$, I could use a normal approximation to estimate the confidence interval of the binomial proportion $\bar{q}(k)$ for any $k$. With this, for any arbitrary width of the interval, I could calculate the number of tests that are required to achieve a given confidence level (let me call such number of tests $k^*$). Since I don’t know $p$, one option would be to solve for $k^*$ assuming the worst case scenario (i.e. $p=0.5$). This was proposed (and discussed) in a related question here . This approach, however, does not take into account that $n$ is finite, so once many items have been tested, it becomes very unlikely that one more test will swing the outcome...","['stochastic-processes', 'bayesian', 'statistics', 'probability']"

Question: Is this an actual weakness of non-standard analysis?  Or is Keisler not doing the subject justice by failing to mention that the Lebesgue integral and its generalizations can also be well understood in the framework of nonstandard analysis? Explaining in detail how the construction of the Lebesgue integral carries over to non-standard analysis would be too broad and too much to ask or expect of any answer, so I will without hesitation accept answers only giving references to sources which discuss this issue. This is why I have tagged the question (reference-request). Background: I have been reading Keisler's books about non-standard analysis, the introductory Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach and the more advanced and rigorous Foundations of Infinitesimal Calculus . The argument for why differentiation is more intuitive with non-standard analysis is fairly clear to me, however, I am not convinced yet that the same is true of integration. Specifically, both of Keisler's books only mention how to perform Riemann integration using non-standard analysis, but say nothing about Lebesgue integration (i.e. general integration with respect to an arbitrary measure, not just the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$ and its subsets). In fact, the Lebesgue integral is not mentioned at all.

This has no geometrical extension: just take a function space, for example. But even if we are working in, say, $\mathbb{R}^2$, I could define an inner product that is not the standard one, such that two vectors that are $\it{orthogonal}$ are not $\it{perpendicular}$.

So, I decided to find out if it is true that for all positive integers $k$, $$ 2^{10^k} \equiv 7 \pmod{9} $$ My proof is as follows: Lemma 1. $\, 10^k \equiv 4 \pmod{6}$ for all integers $k \geq 1$ Proof. For all integers $k \geq 1$, the number $10^k + 2$ must be divisible by $6$ since it is even (implying divisibility by $2$), and its digit sum is $3$ (implying divisibility by $3$). Therefore, you can show that
\begin{align*}
10^k + 2 &\equiv 0 \pmod{6} \\
10^k &\equiv 4 \pmod{6} \,\, \text{    for all integers  } k \geq 1
\end{align*} Lemma 2. $\, 2^{4 + 6k} \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, for all integers $k \geq 0$ Proof. If $a \equiv c \pmod{n}$ and $b \equiv d \pmod{n}$, then $a\,b \equiv c\,d \pmod{n}$.
And, by extension, $a\,b^k \equiv c\,d^k \pmod{n}$ (for integers $k \geq 0$). Therefore, with
\begin{align*}
2^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
2^6 \equiv 64 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}

we can show that,
\begin{align*}
2^{4 + 6k} \equiv 7 \cdot 1^k \equiv 7 \pmod{9} \,\, \text{    for all integers  } k \geq 0
\end{align*} Theorem. $\, 2^{10^k} \equiv 7 \pmod{9} $ for all integers $k \geq 1$ Lemma 1 implies that for all integers $k \geq 1$, $10^k = 4 + 6n$ where $n$ is some positive integer. Therefore,
\begin{align*}
2^{10^k} &= 2^{4 + 6n} \\
2^{10^k} \!\!\!\! \mod a &= 2^{4 + 6n} \!\!\!\! \mod a
\end{align*}
for any positive integer $a$. Using this result along with Lemma 2, 
\begin{align*}
2^{10^k} \equiv 7 \pmod{9} \,\, \text{    for all integers  } k \geq 1

Mainly because, I think proving Lemma 2 is a much too long a way to prove this theorem - since it proves a generalization of the theorem first. Also, I discovered that lemma numerically, which feels a bit like cheating. Either way, is there a quicker, more elegant proof which does not: Use Lemma 2, or prove some generalization of the theorem first. Uses Euler's Theorem.
