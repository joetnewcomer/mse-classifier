1063185,$55$ of registered voters favor incumbent mayor. Find probability that the race ends in a tie.,"Fifty-five percent of the registered voters in Sheridanville favor their incumbent mayor in her bid for re-election. If four hundred voters go to the polls, approximate the probability that: (a) the race ends in a tie. Attempt: For part (a) given $n = 400$ and $p = 0.55$ and $(1-p) = 0.45$ we recognized this is a binomial representation.
Thus if the race ends in a tie, then $X = k = 200$.
Thus $P(X = k = 200) = \binom{400}{200}(0.55)^{200}(0.45)^{400-200}$. 
However, I don't know how to simplify, when I plug in the value for a calculator I get error since it is to big. The answer is $0.0053$ (b) the challenger scores an upset victory Attempt: For part b) we  have $P(X < 200) = {\Sigma_{k = 0}^{199} }{\binom{400}{k}(0.55^k)(0.45^{400 - k}}$. The answer is $0.0197$ at the back of the book. can someone please help me simplify or if someone knows a better way to approach it? Any feedback/help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.","['statistics', 'probability']"
1063188,Accuracy of distance and bearing between GPS locations,"I'm writing on an Android app that tracks the distance and bearing between two GPS location (each from a different device). Finding the mean distance and angle between the devices is quite easy, and seems to work well. 
But since my locations are rather close, and I really need the results to be as reliable as possible, I'm also trying calculating the uncertainty of the calculations, and here I need some help. I'm using the accuracy parameter I get from android as my error estimation for the GPS readings (Android docs say this parameter gives a circular radius that the location has a 68% certainty to be within, so I assume the result is normally distributed, and that this parameter is the SD). I know how to officially calculate the propagated uncertainty (using partial derivatives) if I ignore the covariance (which I have no idea if I could even theoretically find) - But this gives me a tremendous uncertainty, since both GPS readings have a very large uncertainty. The thing is, all I'm looking for is the relative distance (or angle) between these location, and I don't care where they really are compared to earth. And since I know that at lest some of this uncertainty is the same for both devices (for instance, Ionospheric effects), I could safely ignore them and get much more precise results.
Even better, if part of the uncertainty comes from random errors, I could filter most of it out even before comparing the locations (Although I suspect that that the location Android provides is already filtered). The thing is, I don't know what part of the uncertainty is random and what part is constant, and I obviously have to deal with them separately... So, to sum up my problem - given two sets of GPS reading, plus their 'accuracy' , how can I tell apart the uncertainty that is the same for both sets, from the part the varies between them?
I'm sure there is a good mathematical way to do this, I just can't think of one...","['statistics', 'error-propagation']"
1063211,Factorizations in the symmetric group,"Notation notes: The cycle $(i,i+1,\dots,j)\in S_n$ is the permutation $(1)(2)...(i,i+1,\dots,j)\dots(n)$ in cycle notation. Motivation Given a factorization of a permutation into certain cycles with non negative exponents, is it possible to find a factorization of the permutation to the same cycle factors (in the same order) but with bounds on the exponents of the factors? For example (factorizing $(1,2)$ ): $(1,2) = (1,2)^1(1,2,3)^0(2,3)^0$ But if the exponent of $(12)$ must be zero we also have $(1,2) = (1,2)^0(1,2,3)^1(2,3)^1$ The Cycles We are given the cycles $\{\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_{2n-1}\}$ in $S_n$ , where $\sigma_1=(1)$ , $\sigma_{2n-1}=(n)$ (the identity element). for every $m$ , $\sigma_m=(i,i+1,\dots,j)$ such that For every two consecutive cycles $\sigma_m=(i,i+1,\dots,j)$ and $\sigma_{m+1}=(k,k+1,\dots,l)$ either $(k=i$ and $l=j+1)$ or $(k=i+1$ and $l=j)$ allowing a special case $(i,i-1)$ to mean $Id$ . In other words, the cycle brackets keep moving one by one to the right from $(1)$ to $(n)$ : Example in $S_4$ : $\bbox[yellow]{(1)}(2)(3)(4)$ $\quad\sigma_1=(1)$ $\bbox[yellow]{(1)(2)}(3)(4)$ $\quad\sigma_2=(1,2)$ $\bbox[yellow]{(1)(2)(3)}(4)$ $\quad\sigma_3=(1,2,3)$ $(1)\bbox[yellow]{(2)(3)}(4)$ $\quad\sigma_4=(2,3)$ $(1)(2)\bbox[yellow]{(3)}(4)$ $\quad\sigma_5=(3)$ $(1)(2)(3)(4)$ $\quad\sigma_6=()\;\;(=Id)$ $(1)(2)(3)\bbox[yellow]{(4)}$ $\quad\sigma_7=(4)$ Equal Factorizations Now we are given $\pi\in S_n$ such that $$ \pi = \sigma_1^{\alpha_1}\dots\sigma_{2n-1}^{\alpha_{2n-1}}.$$ where $\{\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_{2n-1}\}$ are non negative integer exponents. We are also given $2n-1$ non negative integer bounds on the exponents $\{m_1,\dots,m_{2n-1}\}$ . We can assume that each bound $m_i$ is also smaller than the length of the cycle $\sigma_i$ . Are there non negative integer exponents $\{\beta_1,\dots,\beta_{2n-1}\}$ such that $\beta_i\leq m_i$ for every $i$ and $ \pi = \sigma_1^{\beta_1}\dots\sigma_{2n-1}^{\beta_{2n-1}}$ ? Comments It is not important what are the values of $\beta_i$ , just whether they exist. One could go over every possible combination of values of $\beta_i$ , which is $\prod m_i$ options, is there a faster way? Empirical The following was generated going over all possible exponents: $\pi=(1,5)(2,4)$ in $S_5$ can be presented as $\pi=(1)^{\alpha_1}(1,2)^{\alpha_2}(1,2,3)^{\alpha_3}(1,2,3,4)^{\alpha_4}(1,2,3,4,5)^{\alpha_5}(2,3,4,5)^{\alpha_6}(3,4,5)^{\alpha_7}(4,5)^{\alpha_8}(5)^{\alpha_9}$ for the following values of $(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_9)$ : (0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)

From the problem, it is quite obvious that the two variables are not independent; however, I am having trouble showing this formally. I want to find some way to show $f_{X,Z}(x,z)\neq f_X(x) \cdot f_Z(z)$ for some $(x, z)$, but I'm not sure what the joint density function actually is.

Let $f_n$ be defined via $$f_n : D_n \rightarrow \mathbb R: \tfrac kn \rightarrow \tfrac kn + \tfrac 1n$$ The limit I have in mind would be $f: [0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb R: x \mapsto x$.

Hence the answer is $\displaystyle\frac{1}{e}\cdot\frac{a^{\frac{a}{a-b}}}{b^{\frac{b}{a-b}}}$. How can I get that answer? A classmate of mine had a good idea, but we are stuck. The idea is take $f(x)=x^{t+1}$, by the mean value theorem exists $c\in(a,b)$ such that
$$f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.$$
But
$$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}=\frac{b^{t+1}-a^{t+1}}{b-a}\quad\mbox{and}\quad f'(c)=(t+1)c^t.$$
Hence, since $c>0$
$$\left(\frac{1}{t+1}\cdot\frac{b^{t+1}-a^{t+1}}{b-a}\right)^{1/t}=(c^t)^{1/t}=c.$$
Thus
$$\lim_{t\to0}\left(\frac{1}{t+1}\cdot\frac{b^{t+1}-a^{t+1}}{b-a}\right)^{1/t}=\lim_{t\to0}c=c.$$ We are stuck here. Someone has some hint for this? Or some other idea for compute the limit above? Thanks!","['exponentiation', 'derivatives', 'limits']"

This has sometimes been a position of cooperation and sometimes one of conflict, as followed the discovery that $\sqrt 2$ is irrational. It is often the case that new ideas emerge from such areas of tension, resolving the conflict and allowing previously irreconcilable ideas to interact fruitfully.

1063863,Solving Special Function Equations Using Lie Symmetries,"The Lie group and representation theory approach to special functions, and how they solve the ODEs arising in physics is absolutely amazing. I've given an example of its power below on Bessel's equation. Kaufman's article describes algebraic methods for dealing with Hermite, Legendre & associated Legendre functions. Can we take the other special functions mentioned in this paper, obtainable as linear combinations of the conformal symmetries of the Laplacian (expressed as Lie algebra elements), and obtain their solution analogously to how Bessel is solved below? I believe it's something like a geometric interpretation of Weisner's method . Bessel's equation seems to be saying: find a function in the plane such that when we shift it right, then shift it back left again, all locally (i.e. differentially) in polar coordinates, we get the same function: (c.f. Killingbeck, Mathematical Technique's and Applications, sec. 8.21). The idea is to take Bessel's equation, factor it, add an extra variable to make the factors parameter independent so that they become elements of a Lie algebra, identify the meaning of those factors, in this case notice the Lie algebra factors are translations in polar coordinates, and realize it's just a differential expression of a symmetry. Bessel's equation arises from $L R v = v$ when you express $L$ & $R$ in polar coordinates. It makes sense to express them in polar coordinates since Bessel arises from separating the Laplacian assuming cylindrical symmetry, and the $LRv = v$ assumption (not $LRv = w$ ) is motivated by the symmetry of the Laplacian. Using this idea we can, for some reason, actually solve Bessel's equation with a picture!: We just want to shift $\mathcal{J}_n(r,\phi)$ in the x-direction using the operator $e^{a\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}}$ expressed in polar coordinates: $e^{\tfrac{a}{2}(\mathcal{L}-\mathcal{R})}$ and realize it will be equal to $\mathcal{J}_n(r',\phi')$ : So the last line comes from dragging all this to the origin and putting it along the x-axis, here we see the geometric meaning of Bessel functions! (I am not yet completely sure how we link this calculation to the matrix representation of the Euclidean Group $E_2$ $$ g(x,y,\theta)  =  \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
\cos(\theta) & - \sin(\theta) & x \\
\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & y \\
0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right)$$ Sadly, vaguely we can see it represents planar motions, and this is all linked to representation theory , but it's not fully clear to me how exactly). The question is: Is there a similar, easy, unified, geometric exposition for the rest of these types of equations, analogous to [or a better version of] this one, such as those in the following list: It'd be great to understand these other equations, their formulation and solution, with a geometric interpretation like this one.

Then the idea is to glue along the $U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$ but $U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$ is not affine so $\mathbb{A}^n_{U_\alpha\cap U_\beta}$ has no meaning and even if $U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$ is affine, the induced morphism $\varphi_{\alpha,\beta}:\mathbb{A}^n_{U_\alpha \cap U_\beta}\to\mathbb{A}^n_{U_\alpha}$ is not an open immersion so $X_{\alpha,\beta}:=\varphi_{\alpha,\beta}(\mathbb{A}^n_{U_\alpha \cap U_\beta})\not\simeq\mathbb{A}^n_{U_\alpha \cap U_\beta}$ so $X_{\alpha,\beta}\not\simeq X_{\beta,\alpha}$. So the question is: how to glue the $\mathbb{A}^n_{U_\alpha \cap U_\beta}$ to build $\mathbb{A}^n_S$?

Then if (1) the $\psi_{\alpha,\gamma}$ are open immersion then for all $\gamma$ one has $X_{\alpha,\gamma}\simeq X_{\beta,\gamma}$. But I don't see (2) how to conclude that $X_{\alpha,\beta}\simeq X_{\beta,\alpha}$ because the $X_{\alpha,\gamma}$ are only a covering of $X_{\alpha,\beta}$ and not a topology basis and so it is not enough (isn't?). For the point (1) I see that if $(U_\alpha)_f\subseteq U_\alpha$ the $\mathbb{A}^n_{(U_\alpha)_f}\to \mathbb{A}^n_{U_\alpha}$ is an open immersion. But it is not enough because $(U_\alpha)_f$ has no reason to be a $(U_\beta)_g$.

Must this set $A$ have Hausdorf dimension at least $1$?  This is a general part of a question I have in my mind which is whether or not one can use Fubini-type intuitions to count Hausdorf dimensions from intersections with lower dimensional subspaces.  The reason I call this Fubini is that if I know that $A$ intersects every such plane with full $n-1$ dimensional lebesgue measure, then by Fubini, I know $A$ is almost every point in $(a_1, a_2)\times \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ appropriately rotated. Viewed another way, this result, if true, would be intuitive because if $A$ intersects all hyperplanes, then you can translate the points of intersection to form a line, which has Hausdorf dimension $1$.

1064090,Module of differentials in the functorial approach to schemes and quasi-coherent modules,"Recall that for a functor $X : \mathsf{CAlg}(R) \to \mathsf{Set}$ from commutative $R$-algebras to sets one can define quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules as ""compatible"" families of $A$-modules $M_A$ for $A$-points $s \in X(A)$. The compatibility is given by (coherent) isomorphisms $M_A \otimes_A B \cong M_B$ for homomorphisms $A \to B$ (inducing a  $B$-point of $X$). In other words,
$$\mathsf{Qcoh}(X) = \int_{A} \mathsf{Mod}(A)^{X(A)}.$$
In this functorial approach to quasi-coherent modules, I wonder how to define the module of differentials $\Omega^1_{X/R}$ (in such a way that we recover the usual module in the case that $X$ is a scheme)? Notice that $\Omega^1_{X/R}|_A = \Omega^1_{A/R}$ won't be correct; this even fails when $X$ is a scheme. So probably one should first describe the $A$-module $\Omega^1_{X/R} |_A$ if $X$ is a scheme and $\mathrm{Spec}(A) \to X$ is a morphism of schemes. When $\mathrm{Spec}(A) \to X$ is Ã©tale, then the result is $\Omega^1_{A/R}$, but otherwise it will be something more complicated. I've tried to use the fundamental sequences for $\Omega^1$, but didn't succeed. Perhaps it's not even possible to describe $\Omega^1_{X/R} |_A$?

1064193,The missing vector derivative operation,"Generally, the differential operator $d$ takes differential $k$-forms to $(k+1)$-forms.  In $\mathbb{R}^n$ (or more generally on an oriented Riemannian manifold), we can identify vector fields with $1$-forms and $(n-1)$-forms, and functions with $0$-forms and $n$-forms.  If we write $\phi$ for the map between vector fields and 1-forms, and $\psi$ for the map between vector fields and $(n-1)$-forms, then the composite function $=$ 0-form $\xrightarrow{d}$ 1-form $\xrightarrow{\phi}$ vector field is the gradient, and the composite vector field $\xrightarrow{\psi}$ $(n-1)$-form $\xrightarrow{d}$ $n$-form $=$ function is the divergence.  When $n=3$, we also have the composite vector field $\xrightarrow{\phi}$ 1-form $\xrightarrow{d}$ 2-form $\xrightarrow{\psi}$ vector field which is the curl.  And when $n=2$, we have the composite vector field $\xrightarrow{\phi}$ 1-form $\xrightarrow{d}$ 2-form $=$ function which is the ""scalar curl"" that appears in Green's theorem.  Note that it differs from the $n=2$ case of the divergence only in that it involves $\phi$ rather than $\psi$.  When $n=2$ both $\phi$ and $\psi$ relate vector fields to 1-forms, but they do it differently; we have $\phi(\langle F,G\rangle) = F\,dx + G\,dy$, while $\psi(\langle F,G\rangle) = -G\,dx + F\,dy$. This suggests that there is another way to put these together when $n=2$: function $=$ 0-form $\xrightarrow{d}$ 1-form $\xrightarrow{\psi}$ vector field This looks like the $n=2$ case of the gradient, but involves $\psi$ rather than $\phi$.  In coordinates, it takes a function $f$ to the vector field $\langle \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} , -\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\rangle$. I've never seen this operation before; does it have a name?  It seems potentially interesting, e.g. when we specialize the generalized Stokes' theorem to it we get an FTC for its flux line integrals along curves, analogous to the usual FTC for the flow line integral of a gradient field.","['multivariable-calculus', 'vector-analysis', 'differential-geometry']"

1064375,Nonobvious examples of metric spaces that do not work like $\mathbb{R}^n$,"This week, I come to the end of the first year analysis, and suffer from a ""crisis of motivation.""  With this question, I want to chase away my thought, ""Why is it important to study the general properties of metric spaces? Is every good example just a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$?"" I will explain.  During many proofs, I visualize something like $\mathbb{R}^2$.  The professor always draws these pictures: This is good for many theorems, since much of the analysis is motivate by questions about $\mathbb{R}^n$.  But my mental picture is now only $\mathbb{R}^n$. For appreciate the study of metric spaces in full generality, and for intuition, I request more useful examples of metric spaces that are significantly different from $\mathbb{R}^n$, and are not contain in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Here, I say ""useful"" to mean that the example ""could naturally arise in another context"" , in mathematics or an application.  It is frustrate when I ask why some property does not hold in general, and someone tells me consider the discrete metric.  Yes, it is true, and it is easy to see, but the discrete metric is stupid.  Does my property fail in any metric space that someone would care about? In other words, I have the following taxonomy of metric spaces: $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the subsets degenerate examples like the discrete metric contrived examples that I would not see except in analysis (I mean if they are only exist to be pathological, this is where I think to place the Cantor set) I want to expand this taxonomy, so that when I hear the new definition or theorem, I can compare to this collection of good examples.  I know there must be examples with intricate and intuitive interpretations in statistics, science, and engineering. Which metric spaces are not in my mental taxonomy?  In general, what are the useful, non-obvious metric spaces that a student should keep in his mind when learning analysis? To me, the ideal answer includes the description of the metric space, what properties it has to be unique and different, some consequences of the properties that make different from my examples, and (if not obvious) where I could find the metric space in practice. One last thing is that I am looking specifically for the examples which are different as metric spaces , so no equivalence to $\mathbb{R}^n$ or any of the subsets or my other list items.  I mean isometry with equivalence, I think, but maybe to homeomorphism, I am not sure how I make the best cut.

Starting with an initial point of form $(x, y, z)$ and a vector of $(\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z)$ you can get other points on the line by adding the vector to the initial point. Since we are interested in a line that passes through four points, the fourth point on this line will be $(x + 3\Delta x, y + 3\Delta y, z + 3\Delta z)$ You need each of these points to be between 1 and 4 (inclusive). If the initial and final points are within the boundary then all points inbetween will also be. Thus if, $$1 \leq x\leq 4$$ and $$1 \leq x + 3\Delta x \leq 4$$ then you have the following choices: $x = 1$ and $\Delta x = 0, 1$ $x = 2$ and $\Delta x = 0$ $x = 3$ and $\Delta x = 0$ $x = 4$ and $\Delta x = 0$ Resulting in a total of $1\cdot2 + 1\cdot1 + 1\cdot1 + 1\cdot1 = 5$ valid for $x$ and $\Delta x$. The same holds true for the $y$ and $z$ cases, resulting in a total of $5^3$ total choices. However, because the points need to be distinct a vector of $(0, 0, 0)$ is not allowed, and thus we must subtract all cases where $\Delta x = 0$, which make up $(1\cdot1 + 1\cdot1 + 1\cdot1 + 1\cdot1)^3$ cases. The total is thus $5^3 - 4^3 = 61$. However, the correct answer is 76. Why did I not get the right answer?","['algebra-precalculus', 'contest-math', 'combinatorics']"

\mathbf{A}=\{2^n+k,k=0,1,\dots,2^n-1\}
$$ ie the set of all the integers from $2^n$ to $2^{n+1}-1$.
Now let's define a word to be a sequence of zeroes and ones of length $n$. Finally Let's denote by $\mathbf{W}$ the set of all distinct words. Every $x \in \mathbf{A}$has an ""address"" in $\mathbf{W}$ which we denote by $path(x)$, given by $$
path(x)=\{x,T(x),G(x,2),...G(x,n-1)\} \pmod{2}
$$ Now here is the punch line: There is a $1-1$ correspondence between the set of numbers $\mathbf{A}$ and the set of words $\mathbf{W}$, given by the path function. Once we establish that we will have to deal with words instead of numbers which might prove to be more informative. How to show that? First of all note that both sets have $2^n$ elements. So if we can show that the path function is invertible we are done. Equivalently that every word $w \in \mathbf{W}$ has a unique element $a \in \mathbf{A}$ with $path(a)=w$. Equivalently $path(a)=path(b) \Rightarrow a=b$. Here is where I need help because the words are not in standard order, they come scrambled!. Take a look: For $n=1$: $\mathbf{A}=\{2,3\}$, $path(\mathbf{A})=\{0,1\}$ For $n=2$: $\mathbf{A}=\{4,5,6,7\}$, $path(\mathbf{A})=\{00,10,01,11\}$ For $n=3$: $\mathbf{A}=\{8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15\}$, $path(\mathbf{A})=\{000,101,010,110,001,100,011,111\}$ I have checked it for up to $2^8$ and it holds. No word is repeated, so I am convinced it's true. For any $x \in \mathbf{N}$ now we find the corresponding $n$ (which is basically $[\log{x}]$), the $\mathbf{A}$ set and then we find the path, so the path function is defined over all of $\mathbf{N}$. The power of the words representation: $1101001$ means go up twice, go down, go up, go down twice and go up. There are many interesting questions to ask: Can this be a non-trivial cycle? Conversely, given any word $w$, can it belong to a non-trivial cycle? Must there be more ones than zeroes in a non-trivial cycle? Is there an upper bound or lower bound on the fraction of number of ones over the number of zeroes? I guess you can say that I am asking too many questions, but the only answer I really need is this $1-1$ correspondence. I can't crack it but I bet some group theorist out there can help. Many thanks in advance.","['discrete-mathematics', 'limits']"
1064700,Sample path of Brownian Motion within epsilon distance of continuous function,"Given a continuous function $f:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, $f(0)=0$, how can one show that $P(\underset{0\leq t\leq1}{\sup}\left|B_{t}-f(t)\right|<\varepsilon)>0$, where $P$ is the probability measure under which $(B_{t})_{t\geq0}$ is a standard Brownian Motion. Any help would be much appreciated.","['probability-theory', 'brownian-motion']"

1064765,Approximation of $L^2$ function by smooth functions on a manifold,"Let $M$ be a $C^2$ compact Riemannian manifold with boundary. Suppose $f \in L^2(M)$ is such that $0 \leq f \leq 1$. Is it possible to find $f_n \in C^\infty(M)$ such that $0 \leq f_n \leq 1$ for all $n$ and $f_n \to f$ in $L^2(M)$? If $M$ were a bounded set this I could prove via convolution and mollification. Is it possible to do this on a manifold too?  But I don't know if I can just patch it all together. Also, does my manifold need to be $C^\infty$ to make sense of the smooth functions on it?","['manifolds', 'convergence-divergence', 'functional-analysis', 'lp-spaces']"
