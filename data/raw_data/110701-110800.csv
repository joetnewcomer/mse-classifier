1594597,Why are there $12$ automorphisms of $\Bbb Z\oplus \Bbb Z_{3}$?,"Let $A:=\Bbb Z\oplus \Bbb Z_{3}$, then what is $|\text{Aut}(A)|$?  My answer is $4$ but the correct answer  (without explanation) turns out to be $12$! How come? Well my understanding is, it just suffices to find out all the possibilities of $f(1,\bar 1)$ where $f$ is an arbitrary automorphism, since $(1,\bar 1)$ is the generator. So I think there are altogether $4$ possibilities: $(\pm 1, \pm \bar 1),(\pm 1, \mp \bar 1)$. How could there be any more? I'd be very grateful if anyone would solve this puzzle for me!

1594599,Morse functions and connected sum,"My question is closely related to this post but it is slightly different. Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be two smooth closed $n$-manifolds such that there is a Morse function $f_i:M_i\rightarrow \mathbb R$ for $i=1,2$. Moreover suppose that $\mu_k(f_i)$ is the number of critical points of index $k$ of $f_i$ for $k=0,\ldots,n$. If $X:=M_1\#M_2$ is the connected sum, I'd like to find a Morse function $F:X\rightarrow \mathbb R$ such that 
$$\mu_k(F)=\mu_k(f_1)+\mu_k(f_2)\quad\text{for}\; k=1,\ldots, n-1$$
(note the range of the index $k$ from $1$ to $n-1$) Pay attention: I don't want necessarily the critical points of $F$ to be the union on the critical points of $f_1$ and $f_2$. How can I construct such $F$? Edit: I understand that I need to glue $M_1$ and $M_2$ near a maximum and a minimum, but then I don't know how to construct $F$.
When $f_1$ and $f_2$ are heights in $\mathbb R^n$ the geometric picture is clear, but I don't know how to deal with the general case.","['general-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology', 'morse-theory']"

1594617,Difficulty using Excel to solve the double pendulum problem using RK4 to solve four simultaneous first order ODEs,"I have set up a spreadsheet in Excel to solve the double pendulum problem using RK4 on the four first order DEs. However it isn't working, as the energy in the system is increasing drastically, instead of staying constant. I have spent days (literally) checking the Lagrangian and the spreadsheet entries, and I can't find any faults. I wonder if I am mis-applying the RK4 procedure. I can't find any examples of this in Excel - only Matlab, which is quite different, and I don't have it! I'm desperate and so thought I would post here. I have four first order DEs. The first two are simple  W'=Y,   X'=Z.    Y' & Z' are both very long with terms in W, X, Y & Z.    So, I have W'=f(t,Y)

X'=f(t,Z)

Y'=f(t,X,Y,Z)

Z'=f(t,X,Y,Z) I calculate Wn+1 = Wn + h/6*(J1 + 2*J2 + 2*J3 + J4)

Xn+1 = Xn + h/6*(K1 + 2*K2 + 2*K3 + K4)

Yn+1 = Yn + h/6*(L1 + 2*L2 + 2*L3 + L4)

Zn+1 = Zn + h/6*(M1 + 2*M2 + 2*M3 + M4) The values of these constants are worked out as follows: (Is this where I'm going wrong?) J1 = f(tn, Yn)

J2 = f(tn + h/2, Yn + h/2*L1) 

J3 = f(tn + h/2, Yn + h/2*L2)

J4 = f(tn + h, Yn + h*L3) The values for K1, K2, K3 & K4 are calculated in the same way using Zn & M1, M2 M3 & M4. As Y is a function f(t, W, X, Y, Z), I calculate as follows: L1 = f(tn, Wn, Xn, Yn, Zn)

L2 = f(tn + h/2, Wn + h/2*J1, Xn + h/2*K1, Yn + h/2*L1, Zn + h/2*M1)

L3 = f(tn + h/2, Wn + h/2*J2, Xn + h/2*K2, Yn + h/2*L2, Zn + h/2*M2)

L4 = f(tn + h, Wn + h*J3, Xn + h*K3, Yn + h*L3, Zn + h*M3). The values for M1, M2, M3 & M4 used to calculate Z were computed in the exact same manner as for  L1 etc. above.

1594619,Am I using a correct method to derive these orders?,"As an exercise I am calculating some orders of some elements but I don't know if my method is correct. Please can you tell me if my solutions (not the results but the steps
  to deduce the results) are correct? The first exercise is this: If $|a^5| = 12$ , what are the possibilities for $|a|$ ? If $|a^4| = 12$ , what are the possibilities for $|a|$ ? My method: In general, if $|a|=n$ then $|a^k|={n\over \gcd(n,k)}$ . Using this we can derive: $$ 12 = {n\over \gcd(n,5)} \tag{$\ast$}$$ We also know that $a^{12 \cdot 5} = a^{60} = e$ and therefore $n \mid 60$ . Divisors of $60$ are $1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30 $ and $60$ . From $(\ast)$ we know that $n$ is a multiple of $12$ . This narrows down the possibilities for $n$ to: $$ n \in \{12, 60\}$$ If $n=60$ then $|a^5| = 12$ . Also, if $n=12$ then $|a^5|=|a|=12$ . Therefore the possibilities for $n$ are $12$ and $60$ . Now for the equation $|a^4|=12$ : By the same argument as before we deduce $$ 12 = {n\over \gcd(4,n)}$$ and $a^{4 \cdot 12} = a^{48}=e$ and therefore $n\mid 48$ . Divisors of $48$ are $1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,24$ and $48$ . Again we know from the equation above that $n$ is a multiple of $12$ . This narrwos down the possibilities to $$ n \in \{12,24,48\}$$ If $n=12$ then $|a^4|=3$ so this is not possible. Similarly, if $n=24$ then $|a^4|=6$ . Therefore the only possible $n$ is $48$ .","['group-theory', 'proof-verification']"

1594683,Compute the Jacobson radical of the group ring $\mathbb{F}_2S_3$.,"Compute the Jacobson radical and the maximal semisimple quotient of
  the group ring $\mathbb{F}_2S_3$ of the symmetric group on three
  letters over the field with two elements, and compute the same for
  $\mathbb{F}_3S_3$. Since the ring is left Artinian (being finite), the Jacobson radical is a nilpotent two-sided ideal. So to find it, we just need to look for a maximal nilpotent ideal. I started by narrowing down the candidates: the Jacobson radical of $R = \mathbb{F}_2S_3$ is the intersection of the annihilators of the simple modules over $R$. The trivial representation is a simple $R$ module, and it has annihilator the augmentation ideal $\mathfrak{a}$. Therefore $J(R) \subset \mathfrak{a}$. The only nilpotent ideal I succeeded in finding in $\mathfrak{a}$ was the ideal $I$ generated by $s =  \sum_{g \in S_3}g$. Note that $rs = 0$ if $r$ has an even number of terms and $rs = s$ if $r$ has an odd number of terms. Therefore $I$ has two elements. I haven't been able to prove that $I$ is a maximal nilpotent ideal, or that $R/I$ is semisimple. Beyond just this particular problem, how would you approach computing the Jacobson radical or nilradical of a ring (including a noncommutative ring) in general?","['abstract-algebra', 'noncommutative-algebra', 'representation-theory', 'group-rings']"
1594692,"Gauss´s law proof ""details""","I know that this question has already been asked multiple times but I´m still not getting on the mathematical details behind the answers... So I hope that this question doesn´t get closed; also I already published it in https://physics.stackexchange.com/ but unfortunately nobody answered me and I´m guessing because this is more a mathematical question rather than a physics question. First I will consider the case of discrete charges 
(I suppose that there are $M$ charges inside the volume and $N-M$ charges outside the volume; hence a total of $N$ charges): $$\begin{align}
\oint_{\partial\Omega}\vec{E}\cdot\vec{dA} & =\int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot \vec{E} dV \\
& = {1\over 4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{k=1}^{N}q_k\int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot({\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}\over |\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}|^3})dV \\
& = {1\over 4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{k=1}^{M}q_k\int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot({\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}\over |\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}|^3})dV +  {1\over 4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{k=M+1}^{N}q_k\int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot({\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}\over |\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}|^3})dV
\end{align}$$ Note that in the second term of the last equality is zero because we are just integrating over $\Omega$ and in this term the charges are outside $\Omega$ hence: $\int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot({\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}\over |\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}|^3})dV=0$ Know we can compute the first term of the last equality using the fact that: $\nabla\cdot({\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}\over |\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}|^3})=4\pi\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r_k})$ $${1\over 4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{k=1}^{M}q_k\int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot({\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}\over |\vec{r}-\vec{r_k}|^3})dV={1\over \epsilon_0}\sum_{K=1}^{M}q_k\int_{\Omega}\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r_k})dV={1\over \epsilon_0}\sum_{k=1}^{M}q_k$$ (In the last equality I´m not sure that I can use the fact that $\int_{\Omega}\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r_k})dV=1$ because I´m not integrating over all the space) Now if we want to derive the differential form: $$\int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot \vec{E}dV={1\over \epsilon_0}\sum_{k=1}^{M}q_k={1\over \epsilon_0}\sum_{k=1}^{M}q_k\int_{\Omega}\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r_k})d^3\vec{r}={1\over \epsilon_0}\int_{\Omega}\rho(\vec{r})d^3\vec{r}$$ And then we conclude that $$\nabla\cdot E={1\over \epsilon_0}\rho$$ (becuase the equality of integrals is valid for all region $\Omega$) So if everthing is right then that is gauss law for discrete charges; Now what happens if a have a continuous charge that is inside $\Omega$? (for example a solid charged cone inside a sphere) this is the part where I´m having trouble: The electric field of a continuous dsitribution is given by $$E(\vec r)={1\over 4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{\Omega´}\rho(\vec s)({\vec{r}-\vec{s}\over |\vec{r}-\vec{s}|^3})d^3\vec{s}$$ where $\Omega´$ is the charged region in the space we have that
$$\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot{E(\vec{r})} & = {1\over 4\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{\Omega´}\rho(\vec s)\nabla \cdot({\vec{r}-\vec{s}\over |\vec{r}-\vec{s}|^3})d^3\vec{s} (\text{differentiation under the integral sign})\\
& = {1\over \epsilon_0}\int_{\Omega´}\rho(\vec{s})\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{s})d^3\vec{s} \\
& = {1\over \epsilon_0}\rho(\vec{r}) (\text{shifting property of delta function})
\end{align}$$ (I have a big issue in this part becuase the density $\rho$ is just defined in the charged solid region $\Omega´$ so it doesn´t make sense to talk about the density in all the space;also i´m not sure if the last equality is valid because I´m not integrating over all the space) Know assuming that it makes sense to talk about $\rho$ in all the space then if we want to obtain the integral form we use the divergence theorem:
 $$\oint_{\partial \Omega}E\cdot \vec{dS}=\int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot\vec{E}dV={1\over \epsilon_0}\int_{\Omega}\rho(\vec{r})dV={Q_{int}\over \epsilon_0}$$ I would really appreciate if you can help me with the ""details"" of the proof, also any comments or suggestion would be highly appreciated.","['physics', 'mathematical-physics', 'proof-verification', 'multivariable-calculus', 'vector-analysis']"

1594750,Properties of the per-element exponential (Hadamard exponential) for matrices,"I'm asking this question mostly out of curiosity, though I do also have a potential application. In linear algebra we usually define the matrix emponential as $e^A = I + A + \frac{1}{2}A^2 + \frac{1}{6}A^3 + \dots$, which has lots of nice properties. However, we could also define a different kind of ""matrix exponentiation"", which I'll write $e^{\circ A}$, where $(e^{\circ A})_{ij} = e^{A_{ij}}$, i.e. we just apply the exponential function to each element independently. After writing this question I guessed that the name of this operation would be ""Hadamard exponential."" An internet search revealed that it's mentioned by this name in a few textbooks and research papers, but in general I can find very little written about its properties from a linear algebra point of view. (I've edited this post to use what seems to be standard notation for the Hadamard exponential.) One obvious thing is that it inherits all the usual properties of exponentiation, as long as we use the Hadamrd product $(\circ)$ (i.e. per-element multiplication) instead of the usual matrix product. Then we can immediately apply results like the Schur product theorem to conclude that if $e^{\circ A}$ and $e^{\circ B}$ are both positive definite then so is $e^{\circ (A+B)}$. Another obvious property is that for real matrices, the elements of $e^{\circ A}$ are all positive, and hence the Perron-Frobenius theorem applies. However, what I would particularly like to know is whether anything can be said about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $e^{\circ A}$ in terms of the eigendecomposition of $A$. I suspect that there is no straightforward relationship in general, but I would expect there to be inequality constraints. In short, my question is, has the operation I've called $\operatorname{eexp}$ been studied in linear algebra, and what is known about its properties?","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'exponential-function', 'linear-algebra']"

1594803,Projective Plane Embedding Ambiguity,"I'm working in a problem in do Carmo: let $F: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^4$ be given by $$
F(x,y,z) \;\; =\;\; (x^2 - y^2, xy, xz, yz).
$$ Let $\varphi: \mathbb{S}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ be the restriction $\varphi = F|_{\mathbb{S}^2}$.  Observing that $\varphi(p) = \varphi(-p)$ for all $p \in \mathbb{S}^2$ we can unambiguously define the mapping $\tilde{\varphi}: \mathbb{RP}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^4$ given by $\tilde{\varphi}[p] = \varphi(p)$.  Ultimately we want to show that $\tilde{\varphi}$ is an immersion, and subsequently an embedding of the projective plane into $\mathbb{R}^4$. My Problem: It's not hard to see, considering $\mathbb{RP}^2 \approx \mathbb{S}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$, that the map $\tilde{\varphi}$ is well-defined, but when I try to take the differential, wouldn't we expect $d\tilde\varphi_p$ to be well-defined as well?  This is to say, shouldn't we expect $d\tilde{\varphi}_p = d\tilde{\varphi}_{-p}$, or at least the columns of each Jacobian to span the same 2-dimensional affine subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$? Example 1 : First consider the case that we restrict $F$ to the upper and lower open hemispheres.  We can rewrite these restrictions as \begin{eqnarray*}
F^{z+}(x,y) & = & \left (x^2 - y^2, xy, x\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}, y\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2} \right ) \\
F^{z-}(x,y) & = & \left ( x^2 - y^2, xy, -x\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}, -y\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2} \right )
\end{eqnarray*} where we can see that $F^{z+}(x,y) = F^{z-}(-x,-y)$.  This yields two Jacobians which are incompatible at antipodal points: \begin{eqnarray*}
dF^{z+}_{(x,y)} & =& \left [ \begin{array}{cc}
2x & -2y \\
y & x \\
\frac{1- 2x^2 - y^2}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}} & -\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}} \\
-\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}} & \frac{1-x^2-2y^2}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}}
\end{array} \right ] \\
dF^{z-}_{(x,y)} & = & \left [ \begin{array}{cc}
2x & -2y \\
y & x \\
-\frac{(1-2x^2-y^2)}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}} & \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}} \\
\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}} & -\frac{(1-x^2-2y^2)}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}} \\
\end{array} \right ].
\end{eqnarray*} Wouldn't we expect that if $F(p) = F(-p)$ for all $p \in \mathbb{R}^3$ that at least $dF^{z+}_{(x,y)} = dF^{z-}_{(-x,-y)}$, or at least have their columns span the same affine subspace? Example 2: Another approach I've considered for this problem is using the stereographic projection $\pi^{-1}:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{S}^2/\{N\}$ given by $$
\pi^{-1}(u,v) \;\; =\;\; \left ( \frac{2u}{u^2+v^2+1}, \frac{2v}{u^2+v^2+1}, \frac{u^2+v^2-1}{u^2+v^2+1} \right )
$$ and writing $\varphi|_{\mathbb{S}^2/\{N\}} = F \circ \pi^{-1}$. The problem that I see with this latter approach is that antipodal coordinates in the plane don't map to antipodal coordinates in $\mathbb{S}^2/\{N\}$. Overall my main question is how we appropriately compute the Jacobian $d\tilde{\varphi}_p$, and how are we guaranteed that the Jacobian is well-defined on antipodal points of $\mathbb{S}^2$?  I assume that this condition is necessary in order to show that $\tilde{\varphi}$ is an immersion.  Am I mistaken?","['multivariable-calculus', 'differential-geometry', 'manifolds']"

$$f(x)=\frac{1}{5+4 \cos x}$$
is periodic with the main period being $T=2\pi$. The graph is easily obtained, but here is a graph from Desmos as it looks better: The function is even, so all the coefficients $b_{n}$ vanish: $$b_{n}=\frac{2}{t}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} f(x)\sin\left ( \frac{2n\pi x}{T} \right )\,dx=0.$$

I know that we can invoke the Riesz representation theorem to conclude that $M(X)\equiv C_0(X\to\mathbf{C})^*$, since the dual is always a Banach space, then the claim follows. I want to prove it without using the Riesz representation theorem. Let $(\mu_n)$ be a Cauchy sequence in $M(X)$, we observe that 
$$|\mu_m(E)-\mu_n(E)|\leq |\mu_m-\mu_n|(E)\leq \|\mu_m-\mu_n\|$$

I get everything up until the bold part and I have a feeling some crucial steps are omitted, can anybody help clear this up? Let $R$ be an integral domain. If every two elements of $R$ have a greatest common divisor, then every irreducible element in $R$ is prime. Proof: Consider an irreducible element $p \in R$ and $x,y \in R$ such that $p\vert xy$. Suppose now that $py$ and $xy$ have a greatest common divisor $z$ in R. We want to conclude from this that $p \vert x$ or $p \vert y$. This is obvious if $xy = 0$, so we may assume that $xy \neq 0$. Then $z \neq 0$. As both $p$ and $y$ divide each of $py$ and $xy$, we have that $z = pu = yv$ for certain $u,v \in R$. Using the cancellation law with $\boldsymbol z \boldsymbol \neq \boldsymbol 0$, we obtain that $\boldsymbol v \boldsymbol \vert \boldsymbol p$ . As $p$ is irreducible, either $v \in R^\times$ (i.e. the set of invertible elements of $R$) or $v \sim p$ (i.e. $Rv = Rp$). If $v \sim p$, then $p \vert x$.

1595046,"A ""new"" formula relating the quotients of the upper central series, method of proof and background information","For a finite group $G$ the upper central series is defined inductively by 
$$
 Z_1(G) := Z(G), \qquad Z_{i+1}(G) / Z_i(G) = Z( G / Z_i(G) ).
$$
Now I am interested in generalising this formula, i.e. for $j > i$ do we have
$$
 Z_j(G) / Z_i(G) = Z_{j - i}( G / Z_i(G) ).
$$
Of course for $j = i + 1$ this is just the definition. I have two proofs, the first is by direct computation, i.e. using
$$
 Z_{i+1}(G) = \{ x \in G : [x,y] \in Z_i(G) \mbox{ for all } y \in G \}.
$$
Suppose inductively that $Z_{j-1}(G)/Z_i(G) = Z_{(j-1)-i}(G/Z_i(G))$ and $j > i+1$,
then
\begin{align*}
 xZ_i(G) \in Z_j(G) / Z_i(G) 
  & \Leftrightarrow x \in Z_j(G) \\
  & \Leftrightarrow \forall y \in G : [x,y] \in Z_{j-1}(G) \\
  & \Leftrightarrow \forall y \in G : [x,y]Z_i(G) \in Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G) \\
  & \Leftrightarrow \forall y \in G : [x,y]Z_i(G) \in Z_{(j-1)-i}(G / Z_i(G)) \\
  & \Leftrightarrow \forall y \in G : [xZ_i(G), yZ_i(G)] \in Z_{(j-1)-i}(G / Z_i(G)) \\
  & \Leftrightarrow xZ_i(G) \in Z_{j-1}( G / Z_i(G) ).
\end{align*}
But I do not like that approach. As for subgroup series, using properties of subgroups like the Dedekind identity or isomorphism theorem are preferable, as they lead more easily to generalisations for other subgroup series, and I guess it might be possible to give such a proof here, without breaking it down to computing with commutators. I tried, and arrived at a second proof. Suppose inductively that for $j > i + 1$
$$
 Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G) = Z_{(j-1)-i}( G / Z_i(G) )
$$
then by taking the quotient of both sides of the formula we want to prove, the isomorphism theorems and using the definition for $j = i + 1$
$$
 (Z_j(G) / Z_i(G)) / ( Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G) ) \cong Z_j(G) / Z_{j-1}(G) = Z(G / Z_{j-1}(G)) 
$$
and by induction hypothesis and using the definition
\begin{align*}
 Z_{j-i}( G / Z_i(G) ) / Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G)
  & = Z_{j-i}( G / Z_i(G) ) / Z_{(j-1)-i}( G / Z_i(G) ) \\
  & = Z( ( G / Z_i(G) ) / Z_{(j-1)-i}( G / Z_i(G) ) ) \\
  & = Z( G / Z_i(G) / ( Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G) ) )  \\
\end{align*}
and as $G / Z_i(G) / ( Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G)) \cong G / Z_{j-1}(G)$ we have
$$
 Z(G / Z_i(G) / ( Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G) ) ) ) \cong Z( G / Z_{j-1}(G) ).
$$
So we have that both subgroups
$$
 ( Z_j(G) / Z_i(G) ) / ( Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G) )
$$
and
$$
 Z_{j-i}( G / Z_i(G) ) / Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G)
$$
are isomorphic to the same group, so in general we just get that they are isomorphic. But to conclude $(Z_j(G) / Z_i(G)) = Z_{j-i}( G / Z_i(G) )$, i.e. that their inverse images under the quotient are equal, we need more than isomorphism, we need equality. Looking at the proof of the isomorphism theorems, we see that a map realising the mentioned isomorphisms is $\varphi : G / Z_i(G) \to G / Z_{j-1}(G)$ with
$$
 xZ_i(G) \mapsto xZ_{j-1}(G).
$$
Then the map $\overline \varphi(x \cdot \mbox{ker}(\varphi)) := \varphi(x)$
with $x \in G / Z_i(G)$ gives the isomorphism, and as
$$
 \overline{\varphi}( (Z_j(G) / Z_i(G)) / (Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G) ) )
 = \overline{\varphi}( Z_{j-i}( G / Z_i(G) ) / Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G) ) 
$$
and as $\overline{\varphi}$ is an isomorphism we have
$$
 (Z_j(G) / Z_i(G)) / (Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G) )
 = Z_{j-i}( G / Z_i(G) ) / Z_{j-1}(G) / Z_i(G)
$$
hence $Z_j(G) / Z_i(G) = Z_{j-i}( G / Z_i(G) )$. Okay, both proofs make me at least confident that the formula holds. But I do not like them both. The first is commutator computation, which I guess could be avoided by reasoning on the ""higher level"" of the subgroup series, in the other a specific map used in the proof of the isomorphism theorem is involved, which also takes some flavour of generality as the isomorphism theorem are not used plainly, but with respect to some arbitrary choice, i.e. a map realising the stated isomorphisms. So is there any proof of this formula which does not has these drawbacks? I also looked up the literature, but I nowhere found this formula. So maybe most authors consider it to trivial to state or do not mind it, I do not know but at least if it is trivial there must be some (preferable elegant) short proof. So specifically I am asking about an elegant proof of this formula, and maybe some background information. Is it known, used somewhere?","['finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

Let's say we measure how much are sea fish toxic and we want to know the expected value of toxicity, when we catch some fish. From my understanding we should do something like this: 
If we knew the random variable of toxicity $X$, we could compute the expected value, but we don't know that. If we want to estimate the expected value, the estimation is:
$E(\bar x)= u$, where $\bar x$ is sample mean. So we catch, for example, $100$ fish and measure the toxicity - now is the part, where I am lost: In my scripts it says, that this is a random sample, from which we get random vector $(X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots, X_{100})$. How can we get a random vector? Random vector should consist of random variables - does that mean, that each of the fish get's it's own random variable? Or does it mean, that the random vector gives us values of random events and those random events mean : I will catch $100$ of fish from Atlantic is $1$ event and I will catch $100$ fish from Pacific is second event? The second one seems right to me. Ok let's say we have this random vector To compute the estimation: $E(\bar x)=\frac 1n \sum_{i = 1}^{100}x_i$ $N$ = all fish in sea Now does $x_i$ represent the numerical values of toxicity of each fish caught from our random vector $(X_1, X_2, \dots)$? So if we would be able to catch all the fish in sea, wouldn't this be just an average? Maybe the best thing to understand this would be, if someone could estimate the expected value, when for example we caught $10$ fish: toxicity of each fish: $5,2,7,8,9,1,1,1,2,1 - $

I start off by using the definition: $\frac{\phi(n)}{n} = \sum_{d|n} \frac{\mu(d)}{d}$ Where $\phi$ is Eulers function, and $\mu$ is the Mobius mu function. From here, I use the Mobius inversion formula to give: $\frac{\mu(n)}{n} = \sum_{d|n}d\frac{\phi(\frac{n}{d})}{n}\mu(d)$ Now summing $n$ up to $x$: $\sum_{n \leq x}\frac{\mu(n)}{n} = \sum_{n \leq x}\sum_{d|n}d\frac{\phi(\frac{n}{d})}{n}\mu(d)$ Now I'm not fully sure on how I can rearrange things inside the two summations on the right hand side, so leaving things as they are; using that $\sum_{d|n} \mu(d) = 1$, if and only if $n =1$. Hence: $\sum_{n \leq x}\frac{\mu(n)}{n} = \sum_{d|1}d\phi(\frac{1}{d})\mu(d)$ Thus $d=1$.

1595368,On a step in Egorov's measure theorem,"I am in the midst of proving the following Theorem Let $(f_n)$ be a sequence of measurable functions converging almost everywhere to a function $f$ on a measurable set $E\subset [0,1]=\Omega$. Then given any $\delta >0$ there exists a measurable set $E_{\delta} \subset E$ where the convergence is uniform on (as well as some other conditions but I dont care to write them as they do not pertain to my question). I will write out the first few lines of the proof to where I have a question. Proof The function $f$ is measurable since it is the limit of a sequence of measurable functions that converges almost everywhere (we are tacitly assuming our measure $\mu$ is complete). Let
$$E_n^m=\bigcap_{i>n} \left\{x\in \Omega : |f_i(x)-f(x)|<\frac{1}{m}\right\}.$$
Moreover, let 
$$E^m=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n^m.$$
It follows that
$$E_1^m \subset E_2^m \subset \dotso, $$
and hence, by the continuity theorem of $\mu$, we have given any $\delta >0$, there is a $n_0(m)$ such that
$$\mu(E^m\setminus E_{n_0(m)}^m) < \frac{\delta}{2^m}.$$ (The continuity theorems are if $A=\cup_n A_n$ where $A_n$ are measurable and increasing in the sense that $A_1 \subset A_2 \subset \dotso$ then $\mu(A)=\lim_{n\to \infty} \mu(A_n)$, and a similar statement and conclusion for decreasing sets and their intersection.) I don't understand how they are exactly applying the continuity theorem to the increasing sequence at hand to get $\mu(E^m\setminus E_{n_0(m)}^m) < \frac{\delta}{2^m}.$ I know it follows, by applying the theorem, that we may make,
$$|\mu(E_n^m)-\mu(E^m)|<\epsilon$$

1595387,dropping injectivity from multivariable change of variables,"The change of variables for multivariable integration in Euclidean space is almost always stated for a $C^1$ diffeomorphism $\phi$, giving the familiar equation (for continuous $f$, say) $$\boxed{\int_{\phi(U)}f=\int_U(f\circ\phi)\cdot|\det D\phi|}$$ Of course, this result by itself is not very useful in practice because a diffeomorphism is usually hard to come by. The better advanced calculus and multivariable analysis texts explain explicitly how the hypothesis that $\phi$ is injective with $\det D\phi\neq0$ can be relaxed to handle problems along sets of measure zero -- a result which is necessary for almost all practical applications of the theorem, starting with polar coordinates. Despite offering this slight generalization, very few of the standard texts state that the situation can be improved further still: there is an analogous theorem for arbitrary $C^1$ mappings $\phi$, not just those that are injective everywhere except on a set of measure zero. We simply account for how many times a point in the image gets hit by $\phi$, giving $$\boxed{\int_{\phi(U)}f\cdot\,\text{card}(\phi^{-1})=\int_U(f\circ\phi)\cdot|\det D\phi|}$$ where $\text{card}(\phi^{-1})$ measures the cardinality of $\phi^{-1}(x)$. I think this theorem is a lot more natural and satisfying than the first, for many reasons. For one thing, it removes a huge restriction, bringing the theorem closer to the standard one-variable change of variables for which injectivity is not required (though of course the one-variable theorem is really a theorem about differential forms). It emphasizes that a certain degree of regularity is what's important here, not injectivity. For another thing, it's not a big step from here to degree theory for smooth maps between closed manifolds or to the ""area formula"" in geometric measure theory. (Indeed, the factor $\text{card}(\phi^{-1})$ is a special case of what old references in geometric measure theory called the ""multiplicity function"" or the ""Banach indicatrix."") It's also used in multivariate probability to write down densities of non-injective transformations of random variables. And last, it's in the spirit of modern approaches to at least gesture at the most general possible result. The traditional statement is really just a special case; injectivity only becomes essential when we define the integral over a manifold (rather than a parametrized manifold), which we want to be independent of parametrization. I think teaching the more general result would greatly clarify these matters, which are a constant source of confusion to beginners. Yet many otherwise excellent multivariable analysis texts (Spivak, Rudin PMA and RCA, Folland, Loomis/Sternberg, Munkres, Duistermaat/Kolk, Burkill) don't mention this result, even in passing, as far as I can tell. I've had to hunt for discussions of it, and I've found it here: Zorich, Mathematical Analysis II (page 150, exercise 9, for the Riemann integral) Kuttler, Modern Analysis (page 258, for the Lebesgue integral) Csikós, Differential Geometry (page 72, for the Lebesgue integral) Ciarlet, Linear and Nonlinear Functional Analysis with Applications (page 34, for the Lebesgue integral) Bogachev, Measure Theory I (page 381, for the Lebesgue integral) the Planet Math page on multivariable change of variables (Theorem 2) I'm also confident I've seen it in some multivariable probability books, but I can't remember which. But none of these is a standard textbook, except perhaps for Zorich. My question : are there standard references with nice discussions of this extension of the more familiar result? Probability references are fine, but I'm especially curious whether I've missed some definitive treatment in one of the classic analysis texts.

However, we also see that the explicit solution for this problem is $(x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (\frac{-1}{t+c_1}, c_2e^{-t}, c_3e^t)$. The global stable manifold is defined as the set of $(x(t), y(t), z(t))$ such that $\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (0,0,0)$. This means $c_3 = 0$ is the only choice, while $c_1$ and $c_2$ can be anything. Thus, the global stable manifold are the entire $xy$-plane. Similarly, for the global unstable manifold, $\lim_{t\rightarrow -\infty} (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (0,0,0)$. This occurs only if $c_2 = 0$. Thus, the unstable manifold is the entire $xz$-plane.

Prove that $$\lim _\limits{x \to 0} xf(x) = 0.$$ My attempt at a solution We may assume without loss of generality that $f$ is positive, and unbounded near zero; thus we can write $$\infty >\int_0^1 f\,dm=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \int_{\frac{1}{n+1}}^{\frac 1n}f\,dm.$$ Then $$ \int_{\frac{1}{n+1}}^{\frac 1n}f\,dm \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{as}\quad n\rightarrow \infty. $$ Also since $f$ is decreasing, we have $$f \left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\left( \frac 1n - \frac{1}{n+1}\right) \leq \int_{\frac{1}{n+1}}^{\frac 1n}f\,dm \leq f \left(\frac{1}{n+1}\right)\left( \frac 1n - \frac{1}{n+1}\right).$$ I want to say $$ \lim _\limits{x \to 0} xf(x) = \lim _\limits{n \to \infty} \frac 1n f \left( \frac 1n \right) = 0,$$ But that's not exactly what I have in my inequalities. Added as pointed out by @Hetebrij below, Note that by showing $\lim _\limits{n \to \infty} \frac1n f\left( \frac 1n  \right) =0$ you have not shown $\lim_\limits{x\to 0}xf(x)=0$ unless you know
  (1) the limit exist or (2) $xf(x)$ is decreasing or increasing. Any hints or suggestions? Would contradiction be better suited for this problem? UPDATE Another attempt: Take any $n>1$. Then $$\frac {1}{2n}f \left(\frac 1n\right) = \left(\frac 1n-\frac {1}{2n}\right)f \left(\frac 1n\right) \leq \int_{[0,1]}f(x)\chi_{\left[\frac{1}{2n},\frac 1n\right]}(x)dx.$$ Now the sequence of functions $$f(x)\chi_{\left[\frac{1}{2n},\frac 1n\right]}(x)$$ is dominated by the integrable function $f$, and converges to $\infty\cdot \chi_{\{0\}}$. Thus by the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem, we have $$\int_{[0,1]}f(x)\chi_{\left[\frac{1}{2n},\frac 1n\right]}(x)dx \rightarrow 0.$$","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'integration', 'measure-theory', 'convergence-divergence']"

1595606,Computational methods for the limiting distribution of a finite ergodic Markov chain,"We wish to show what can be discovered about the limit of a finite, homogeneous, ergodic Markov Chain $X_1, X_2, \dots,$ using simple methods of computation and simulation. Specifically, consider the chain with state space $S = \{0, 1, 2\}$ and transition matrix $P =  \begin{bmatrix}p & q & 0 \\0 & p & q \\q & 0 & p \end{bmatrix},$ where $0 < p < 1$ and $q = 1 - p.$ Imagine states arranged clockwise around a circle, with  3 adjacent to 0. At a transition, a particle moves one state clockwise with probability $q$ and stays put with probability $p$.
This is an ergodic chain because $P^2$ has all positive elements. [Alternatively, it would be enough to observe that 'round trip' transitions $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 0$ are possible (the chain has a single class), and that there positive elements on the principal disgonal (aperiodic).] Also, in our example, the transition matrix $P$ is doubly stochastic (columns, as well as rows, sum to unity), we know that the limiting distribution of the chain is uniform on $S.$  That is $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} P(X_n = k | X_1 = j) = 1/3,$ for $j, k \in S.$ We say that the limiting distribution of this ergodic Markov chain is the probability vector $\lambda = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)$. In our initial answer to this question, we use various algebraic and simulation methods to illustrate this limiting process. Additional Answers on related theoretical and computational topics are welcome.","['markov-chains', 'simulation', 'probability']"

Some trivial observations: The problem is equivalent to finding the smallest $k$ so that $\max\{(1+x)^{500+k}(1-x)^{500-k}|x\in[0,1]\} < 10^9$ Clearly it is equal to $(1-x^{1000-2k})(1+x)^{2k}$ so we must have $(1+x)^{2k}\geq10^9$, since $1+x\leq 2$ this implies $2k\geq 30\implies k\geq 15$. Of course, this is probably useless.

The square root of $A$ is a  bounded non-negative operator $B\geq $ such that $B^2=A$. First, We can assume without loss of generality that $0\leq A\leq I$. Note that $B^2=A$ if and only if 
$$I-B=\frac{1}{2}((I-A)+(I-B)^2).$$
Hence, we definite inductively a sequence $C_n$ of operators as follows: $C_0:=0$, and $C_{n+1}:=1/2((I-A)+C_n^2))$. Then it is easy to see that $C_n$ converges to a bounded non-negetive operator $B$ in the strong operator topology and we also have $B^2=A$, thus the square root exists, but I don't know how to show that it is unique.",['real-analysis']
1595738,Center of the Quaternions: Proof and Method,"I have to calculate the center of the real quaternions, $\mathbb{H}$. So, I assumed two real quaternions, $q_n=a_n+b_ni+c_nj+d_nk$ and computed their products.  I assume since we are dealing with rings, that to check was to check their commutative product under multiplication.  So i'm looking at $q_1q_2=q_2q_1$.  When I do this, I find that clearly the constant terms are identical, so it is clear that the subset $\mathbb{R}$ is in the center.  So, perhaps then that $\mathbb{C}\le\mathbb{H}$.  However i ended up, after direct calculation with the following system; $$c_1d_2=c_2d_1$$
$$b_1d_2=b_2d_1$$
$$b_1c_2=b_2c_1$$ So the determination is then found by solving this system.  Intuitively, I felt that this lead to $0$'s everywhere and thus the center of $\mathbb{H}$, $Z(\mathbb{H})=\mathbb{R}$.  I then checked online for some confirmation and indeed it seemed to validate my result.  However, the proof method used is something I haven't seen.  It was pretty straight forward and understandable, but again, I've never seen it.  It goes like this; Suppose $b_1,c_1,$ and $d_1$ are arbitrary real coefficients and $b_2, c_2,$ and $d_2$ are fixed.  Considering the first equation, assume that $d_1=1$ (since it is arbitrary, it's value can be any real...).  This leads to 
$$c_1=\frac{c_2}{d_2}$$
And that this  is a contradiction, since $c_1$ is no longer arbitrary (it depends on $c_2$ and $d_2$) I really like this proof method, although it is unfamiliar to me.  I said earlier that for my own understanding, it seemed intuitively obvious, but that is obviously not proof: 1) What are some other proof methods for solving this system other than the method of contradiction used below?  I was struggling with this and I feel I sholnd't be. 2) What other proofs can be found in elementary undergraduate courses that use this method of ""assume arbitrary stuff"", and ""fix some other stuff"" and get a contradiction?

If $\mathbf{A}$ is an $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}_p$ whose characteristic polynomial is $m(x)$, then $\mathrm{ord}(\mathbf{A})=p^n-1$, where $\mathrm{ord}(\mathbf{A})$ denotes the least positive integer $k$ such that $\mathbf{A}^k = \mathbf{I}$, where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.
