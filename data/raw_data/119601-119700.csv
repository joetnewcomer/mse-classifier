1784875,About the derivative of a function defined on rational numbers,"I have found this problem: Let $f : \mathbb{Q} → \mathbb{R}$ with property: $$|f(x) − f(y)| \le (x − y)^2 \tag1$$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}$. Prove $f$ is constant. My idea is to consider the formal derivative of $f$ like this: $$f'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac {f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}, h \in \mathbb{Q} $$ Using (1) it's easy to prove the limit exists and is equals $0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Q}$. So $f$ has derivative and $f'(x)=0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Q}$. It follows that $f$ is constant. Unfortunately, it's not that simple because: $$f'\equiv 0 \implies \ f  \ constant \tag 2$$ is a consequence of Mean Value Theorem which is valid only on real intervals. My question: is (2) valid for $f: \mathbb{Q} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$? Obs. I don't need a proof for the problem.","['derivatives', 'functional-equations']"
1784898,Tangent bundle of sphere as a complex manifold,"I'm trying to show that the tangent bundle, $TS^n$ of the n-sphere $S^n$ is diffeomorphic to the set $\sum z_i^2 = 1$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. It's relatively straightforward to see that the tangent bundle of the sphere can be identified with: $$TS^n = \{ (x_0,...,x_n,y_0,...,y_n) : x_i,y_i \in \mathbb{R}, \sum x_i^2 = 1, \sum x_i y_i = 0 \}$$ Now to show this diffeomorphism I tried the natural thing of writing $z_j = x_j + iy_j$ but now we have $\sum z_j^2 = 1 - \sum y_i^2$ so it only lies in the required subspace if we restrict the tangent spaces of the sphere. I'm wondering how to write down a different map that does this? I'm also a little concerned about how to show such a map is a diffeomorphism, how could I show that the identification I've made above as the tangent bundle embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{2(n+1)}$ is smooth? It's probably obvious but I'm struggling to see it! Thanks for any help","['manifolds', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"
1784930,How to find the integral of a quotient of rational functions?,"How do I compute the following integral: $$\int \dfrac{x^4+1}{x^3+x^2}\,dx$$ My attempt: We can write $$\dfrac{x^4+1}{x^3+x^2} = \dfrac{A}{x^2} + \dfrac{B}{x} + \dfrac{C}{x+1}$$ It is easy to find that
$A=1$,
$B=2$, and
$C=-1$. Therefore $$\frac{x^4+1}{x^3+x^2} = \frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{2}{x} - \frac{1}{x+1}$$ Therefore: 
$$\int \frac{x^4+1}{x^3+x^2}\,dx = \int \frac{dx}{x^2} + \int \dfrac{2\,dx}{x} - \int \frac{dx}{x+1} = -\frac{1}{x} +2\log \vert x\vert - \log \vert x+1 \vert + C$$ The problem is I was supposed to find:  $$\int \frac{x^4+1}{x^3+x^2}\,dx = \frac{x^2}{2} - x - \frac{1}{2} - \log \vert x \vert + 2 \log \vert x+1 \vert + C$$ Where is my mistake?","['real-analysis', 'integration', 'calculus']"

1784962,Why the existence of Taylor series doesn't imply it coverges to the original function,"Please note that I've read this question and it did not address mine. I've been presented with the following argument regarding Taylor series: We have a function $f(x)$, now assume that there exists a power series that's equal to it: $$f(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 +\dots$$ One can quickly show, using differentiation, that $$f(x) =f(0) + f'(0) x + \dfrac{f''(0)}{2! }x^2 +\dots$$ It seems that this argument implies two things: For the Taylor series around a point to exist, it has to be
  continuously differentiable (infinitely many times) and defined at
  that point. If the Taylor series for a function exists, then this implies
  it's equal to it, or that it converges to the original function at
  every point $x$. Now I know very well that point 2 is false (not every smooth function is analytic). But point 2 seems to be implied from the argument I presented above which assumes that if a power series exists such that it's equal to the function or in other words, converges to the function for all $x$, then it will be given by the Taylor series. So what's wrong regarding this argument above?","['taylor-expansion', 'calculus']"

1785044,A simple proof that a polygon circumscribing a circle overestimates its perimeter,"Looking at the picture below, it's easy to see why the perimeter of a polygon inscribed in a circle is an underestimation of the circle's perimeter. This follows from the triangle inequality: Any side (say $AB$) of the polygon is shorter than the circular arc with the same endpoints ($\stackrel{\frown}{AB}$). Summing all these inequalities shows the perimeter of the inscribed polygon is indeed smaller than that of the circle. I'm wondering if there is proof that the perimeter of a circumscribed polygon always overestimates the perimeter of the circle, which is as simple as that of the inscribed polygon case.

1785065,Do there exist simple groups of order $n(n+1)$ for some integer $n>1$?,"In the comments to this question , it was remarked that the question of whether a finite group of order $p(p+1)$ is necessarily not simple becomes fairly interesting if we do not assume that $p$ is a prime— if it is a prime, that question's answer and the linked duplicate's answers (and comments) answers in the affirmative. The following basic GAP code for n in [2..10^5] do 
  iter:=SimpleGroupsIterator(n*(n+1),n*(n+1)); 
  for i in iter do 
    Print(n, ""->"", i, ""\n"");

  od; 
od; Shows that no simple groups of such order exist for $n\leq 10^5$ (so no examples with $|G|\leq 10^5(10^5+1)$).  The iterator function quickly starts hitting issues soon after this point, especially once the order meets or exceeds $|A_{15}|$, which occurs before $n=10^6$, limiting how far one can search with this method.  It takes a few minutes to check up through $n=10^5$.  The following variant finds no simple groups of suitable order before $A_{15}$: iter := SimpleGroupsIterator(3,Factorial(15)/2-1);; 
for G in iter do 
  if (Tau(4*Order(G)+1) mod 2) = 1 then

od; I would expect one should be able to hammer out a proof that all such groups are not simple (assuming this is a true statement) by using the classification of finite simple groups and doing a brute-force check on the sporadic and infinite family orders.  But is there a less brutal and more clever way, or does such a simple group actually exist?

1785074,"What should ""The Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra"" assert? [closed]","Closed . This question is opinion-based . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post . Closed 8 years ago . Improve this question Unlike some other basic fields of mathematics, linear algebra does not seem to have a universally agreed-upon fundamental theorem. This I imagine might be because the subject usually admits a lot of equivalent formulations to statements and it is perhaps hard (or pointless) to tell which are the fundamental ones and which are the consequences. Still, some of them might be arguably more natural or less constructed than others, so maybe there is some value in the question of what the ""right"" statement of the ""key idea"" of linear algebra should be, and it what sense it is fundamental? There is a vague entry on this on Wikipedia. What I don't like about it most is simply that it is stated in terms of matrices, which I am accustomed to think of no more and no less than just convenient block notations to encode linear maps on finite-dimensional vector spaces (sure it could be rewritten in terms of linear maps, but do singular value decompositions really fit the above description?) What rings truly fundamental to me is the statement that if $V, W$ are vector space, then any map defined on some basis of $V$ and with values in $W$ extends uniquely to a linear map on $V$ (and what's more, it is injective/surjective/bijective if and only if the system of image vectors is linearly independent/spanning/a basis). I've seen courses calling such a statement the fundamental theorem, a slogan and Lemma x.y, but it seems to me that this statement in particular (and the straightforward proofs of its sub-statements) make it beautifully clear how the concepts of linearity, basis, subspace etc. click. What are people's thoughts on this? EDIT: I agree that the dimension/basis existence theorem is perhaps the most fundamental statement we can make about vector spaces, but it seems to me that the righteous owner of such results is matroid theory. And what's more, this would mean that there is no linear algebra in a choice-free world. I think there is, in principle, nothing to stop us from thinking of linear algebra as being a theory of objects, which are pairs consisting of a vector space with some given basis - shouldn't the FTLA be a statement about such objects (and not care about basis existence in general)?","['linear-algebra', 'soft-question']"

It doesn't look like it would make any integral easier. Except maybe the square root approximation may make some integrals for arc length easier to solve with great accuracy, because you could just enter the derivative of your function as n in the equation.

1785294,Two definitions of the first Chern class,"there are two definitions of the first Chern class that I don't know how to relate - hints and references are both welcome. So, first approach: say that I have a complex vector bundle $E\to M$; I can pass to the frame bundle $F(E)\to M$, where I have a $U(n)-$action, for some $n$. Then I consider the Chern-Weil map
\begin{equation}
S({\frak u}(n)^*)^{U(n)}\to H^*_{U(n)}(F(E))\simeq H^*(M)
\end{equation}
and pick the image of the invariant polynomial $tr$, the trace. (up to some constant) Second approach: I pick a connection $D:\Gamma(E)\to \Gamma(E\otimes TM)$, with $\Gamma(\cdot)$ representing the space of sections, and consider its curvature. Work locally on some $U$ and pick a section $s$ which generates the bundle: we get $D(s)=\theta(s)\cdot s$, with $\theta(s)$ a $1-$form, and apparently the first Chern class is proportional to $d\theta(s)$. I am a bit confused: the very idea of connection seems to be absent from the first approach, so either there's a natural choice of connection, or I get the same result no matter which one I pick. Moreover, it would seem to me that also the choice of generator $s$ matters. Honestly, I don't have much of a clue about where to start tackling the problem - the two things seem quite unrelated.","['algebraic-topology', 'connections', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

1785633,Is it Possible to Construct all Proofs in Complex Analysis using Brownian Motion?,"(First, I am very aware of the fact that Brownian motion is actually probably more difficult to understand than at least basic complex analysis, so the pedagogical merits of such an approach would be questionable for anyone besides a probabilist wanting to refresh or reshape their already existing complex analysis knowledge.) During my stochastic processes lecture, my professor said something to the effect that: ""Every statement in complex analysis can be proven using Brownian motion, in particular using the fact that the image of a Brownian path under a conformal map is Brownian motion up to a time change."" To what extent is this true? Even after he gave a proof of Liouville's Theorem using Brownian motion and promised to give a proof of the Riemann Mapping Theorem during the next lecture, I was still unconvinced. However, now the more that I think about it, it becomes more plausible -- Brownian motion is very closely related to the theory of harmonic functions, and analytic functions are just 2-dimensional harmonic functions satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations (is this correct?). Brownian motion has already been shown to have numerous applications to potential theory and PDEs (to the best of my knowledge), so is a similar formulation of complex analysis in terms of Brownian motion also theoretically possible?

$$\mathbf{\theta} = [\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_j]$$
$$P(\theta|x) = \frac{P(x|\theta)*P(\theta)}{P(x)}$$ which is essentially Likelihood * Prior / Normalizer .

I don't know if this is correct, but in the Lee's book Introduction to Smooth Manifolds, there's something about proper actions that may be related: The discrete group $\mathbb{Z}^n$ acts smoothly, freely and properly on $\mathbb{R}^n$ by translations. Then there is a unique smooth structure making the quotient map into a smooth covering map. To verify that this smooth structure is the same as the one we defined proviously (thinking of $T^n$ as the product manifold $S^1\times ...\times S^1$) we just check that the covering map $\pi:\mathbb{R}^n\to T^n$ [defined above] is a local diffeomorphism with the product smooth structure on $T^n$. Hence $\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$ is diffeomorphic to $T^n$.

1785715,"Finding properties of operation defined by $x⊕y=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}}$? (""Reciprocal addition"" common for parallel resistors)","I have recently found some interesting properties of the function/operation: $$x⊕y = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}} = \frac{xy}{x+y}$$ where $x,y\ne0$ . and similarly, its inverse operation: $$x⊖y = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{y}} = \frac{xy}{y-x} = x⊕(-y)$$ This is a formula often used in physics, for calculating equivalent resistance/capacitance in circuits. I've heard this referred to by my teacher as ""reciprocal addition"" but have not been able to find much significant mention of this operation outside of its direct connection to circuits and an isolated youtube video. Since there is no common name/use for this operation, I'm asking for help in finding properties of this function. to denote that the operations (""o-plus"" and ""o-minus"" -- name from the youtube channel 3Blue1Brown) and proven a few simple properties of it, including many similarities, but also differences, with addition. For example, the ⊕ (""o-plus"") operation is: Associative (EDIT: this only seems fully true if we extend the domain to the projective reals, and say $\infty$ is the identity and $a⊕0=0$ while $a⊕-a=\infty$ ) Commutative Distributive with multiplication However, it does not have an identity (such as zero for addition or 1 for multiplication) at least among the real numbers. EDIT: adding $\infty$ to the domain and working under the projective reals gives $\infty$ as the identity. I've done a lot of playing around with simple properties of ⊕ and found many interesting things about it, such as ways to do arithmetic using it - for instance: $$\frac{a}{x}⊕\frac{a}{y} = \frac{a}{x+y}$$ Which means one would ""o-plus"" fractions by finding a common numerator instead of a common denominator. Also, just as repeated addition is a form of multiplication( $a+a+a+a = 4a$ ), repeated ""o-plussing"" is a form of division. $$a⊕a⊕a⊕a = \frac{a}{4}$$ There are a multitude of cool properties that come out of the definition of this operation that I've defined here, including one the the aforementioned 3Blue1Brown explains in this video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOtduunD9hA ): $$\sqrt[a] x \sqrt[b] x = \sqrt[a⊕b]{x}$$ One other thing I found was the derivative of two ""o-plussed"" functions: $$\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)⊕g(x)) = \frac{f'(x)g(x)^2 + g'(x)f(x)^2}{(f(x)+g(x))^2}$$ which looks over-complicated, and I think it is. I'd like to find a way to describe this function that actually includes the ⊕ operation itself, but have been unable to find one. However, there is a nice parallel which I found which makes more sense of this derivative rule: $$ f⊕g = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{f}+\frac{1}{g}} = \frac{fg}{f+g} = \frac{fg}{f+g}\frac{(f+g)}{(f+g)} = \frac{fg^2+gf^2}{(f+g)^2}$$ which parallels perfectly with what I said before, $$ (f⊕g)' = \frac{f'g^2+g'f^2}{(f+g)^2}.$$ Again, my question is if there exists a generally accepted notation or mathematical discussion of this operation, or if it is used or mathematically discussed outside of a few very specific locations. If not, could anybody just offer comments on my work or prove other interesting properties of this operation? Thanks to anybody for your help! EDIT: Thanks to dls's comment about the Harmonic Mean, I've also found that a⊕b is the solution to the ""crossed ladder problem"" Which asks to find h, given A and B as heights to ""cross ladders"" over. PHOTO: Wikipedia. This leads me to believe it would be natural to define a⊕0 to be zero, since the lines given those heights would intersect at a height of 0. This is not a formal 'definition', just pattern-continuation. One might also define a⊕-a to be 'infinite', since that seems to solve the associativity problem in some cases, though this may not rigorously work... Edit:
Since oplus is so closely related to the Harmonic Mean, it's also interesting to view how the definition of the oplus operation makes the connection between the three means (arithmetic, geometric and harmonic) so much more natural. Starting with the arithmetic mean, $$A = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^n{x_i}$$ we see it involves repeated addition, followed by division, which is the inverse of multiplication (the operation which repeated addition of the same number defines). Similarly, for the geometric mean, $$G = ({\prod_{i=0}^n{x_i}})^{1/n}$$ it involves repeated multiplication, followed by a root, which is the inverse of exponentiation (the operation which repeated multiplication of the same number defines). And finally, the harmonic mean can be written, (there is no easy way to write this in a similar notation to the above, but the idea is the same) $$H = n(x_i⊕x_2⊕x_3⊕...⊕x_n) $$ which involves repeated oplussing, followed by multiplication, which is the inverse of division (the operation which repeated oplussing of the same number defines - as described above). I find this parallel to be an extremely natural way to define the Harmonic mean, and any mean for that matter. In fact, one might imagine a mean defined by any operation of any order (for example, an exponentiation mean, which would use repeated exponentiation followed by a super-root, the inverse of tetration). UPDATE:
I have found a really cool connection between this operation and another area:
Since the oplussing of two real numbers creates an output which is less than both of the originals, I wanted to see what conditions were necessary for the case to be that this is true: $$x⊕y=x-y$$ and the result was fantastic (derivation below)! $$x⊕y=x-y$$ $$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}} = x-y$$ $$\frac{xy}{x+y} = x-y$$ $$xy = x^2-y^2$$ $$0 = x^2-xy-y^2$$ and, using the quadratic formula, $$x = \frac{y±\sqrt{y^2+4y^2}}{2}$$ $$x = y\frac{1±\sqrt{5}}{2}$$ which means that the ratio between x and y is φ≈1.618, the golden ratio! $$x = φy$$ And through this, I saw that only the quadratic formula was necessary to find this ratio, and wondered if there was a number (clearly complex) which might satisfy: $$x⊕y=x+y$$ and there is! $$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}} = x+y$$ $$\frac{xy}{x+y} = x+y$$ $$xy = x^2+2xy+y^2$$ $$0 = x^2+xy+y^2$$ $$x = \frac{-y±\sqrt{y^2-4y^2}}{2}$$ $$x = y\frac{1±\sqrt{-3}}{2}$$ $$x = y\frac{1±\sqrt{3}i}{2}$$ And this is an extremely interesting number - I call it (and I found one internet forum from 2011 which has also named it this) the ""imaginary golden ratio"". $$φ_i = \frac{1+\sqrt{3}i}{2}$$ It has a ton of interesting properties similar to the real golden ratio, and some of its own. I was wondering if anybody could help me uncover a bit of this mystery. Once I am able to write a question which asks more in depth about this number, because I'd like to reignite a discussion that seems to have been left unmentioned since the other forum in 2011. Here are some properties of the imaginary golden ratio. $$φ_i = cos(π/3)+ isin(π/3) = e^{iπ/3}$$ $$|φ_i|=1$$ $$φ_i^2=φ_i-1$$ which parallels $$φ^2=φ+1$$ Here is the link to the other forum: http://mymathforum.com/number-theory/17605-imaginary-golden-ratio.html","['means', 'golden-ratio', 'complex-numbers', 'abstract-algebra', 'calculus']"
1785722,Geometric Intuition about the relation between Clifford Algebra and Exterior Algebra,"It is common to see a relation being established between the Clifford Algebra and the Exterior Algebra of a vector space. Recently reading some texts written by Physicists I've seem applications of Clifford Algebras on which it seems that the author is dealing with the usual exterior algebra somehow. It seems, in that case, that this relation is quite often used when appliying Clifford Algebras on Physics and Geometry. Searching for this a little I've found the Clifford Algebra page on Wikipedia, where we can find a section ""Relation to the exterior algebra"". It is then said: Given a vector space $V$ one can construct the exterior algebra $\bigwedge (V)$, whose definition is independent of any quadratic form on $V$. It turns out that if $K$ does not have characteristic $2$ then there is a natural isomorphism between $\bigwedge(V)$ and $\mathcal{Cl}(V,Q)$ considered as vector spaces. This is an algebra isomorphism if and only if $Q = 0$. One can thus consider the Clifford algebra $\mathcal{Cl}(V,Q)$ as an enrichment of the exterior algebra on $V$ with a multiplication that depends on $Q$ (one can still define the exterior product independent of $Q$). Now I want to get some geometrical intuition on this. I know that the exterior algebra is the algebra inside of which all $k$-vectors can be manipulated together for all possible values of $k$. I also know that a $k$-vector has a direct geometrical meaning: it is a piece of oriented $k$-dimensional subspace. Also I know that one quadratic form $Q$ also has one geometric meaning: it might represent some sort of length defined on $V$. Now, what is the idea here? That when we construct $\bigwedge (V)$ we somehow are not accounting for the idea of ""measure"" of those pieces of $k$-dimensional subspace, because no idea of length was defined in $V$ and then $\mathcal{Cl}(V,Q)$ is the result of carrying the idea of length introduced in $V$ by $Q$ to all the $k$ vectors and hence to the algebra where we manipulate them together? I feel this is not quite the right intuition yet. What is the correct geometrical intuition behind the relation between the clifford algebra and the exterior algebra?","['intuition', 'exterior-algebra', 'multilinear-algebra', 'clifford-algebras', 'linear-algebra']"

Convolution is simply pointwise multiplication under the Fourier transform: $h = f*g$ iff $\hat h = \hat f\hat g$. Relativistic velocity addition is just regular addition under the map $\tanh^{-1}(\cdot/c)$ . ""Reciprocal addition"", $(x,y)\mapsto\cfrac1{\frac1x+\frac1y}$, is just addition under the reciprocal.

Commutativity and associativity are automatically inherited from the original operation, and the identity element is the inverse image of the original identity (if it exists). Of course, one can easily generalize this to $n$-ary operations. My question is twofold: Does this idea of ""performing an operation under the action of a bijection"" have a standard name, perhaps in some specialized context? Can it be considered a group-theoretic conjugation? A differential-geometric pullback? Some category-theoretic operation? What would be a good thing to call it in general?

See the first image below. standard clothoid transition spiral After searching the internet I found a solution for the standard case.  It is possible to calculate the variables y and x which are the distance along the tangent and the perpendicular distance to a point on the spiral, defined by the length along the spiral.  Using y and x it is easy to calculate the coordinate of the point on the spiral in relation to the tangent line.  The given or known values for the solutions are extracted from the Autocad design drawing.  They include the coordinates of the tangent points, start and end of arcs, start and end of clothoids, radiuses of arcs and lengths of clothoids.  The formula used to calculate y and x are shown above.  The calculation is an expansion of Fresnel integrals.  A clothoid is used as a transition spiral because the radius changes linearly along the length of the spiral from infinity at the tangent point to the radius of the arc segment at the end of the spiral.

1785849,How to minimize a distance (more than one problem),"Minimizing a Distance When we seek a minimum or maximum value of a function, it is sometimes easier to work with a simpler function instead. (a) Suppose $g(x) = \sqrt{f(x)}$ where $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$. Explain why the local minima and maxima of $f$ and $g$ occur at the same values of $x$. (b) Let $g(x)$ be the distance between the point $(3, 0)$ and the point $(x, x^2)$ on the graph of the parabola $y = x^2$. Express $g$ as a function of $x$. (c) Find the minimum value of the function $g$ that you found in part (b) . Use the principle described in part (a) to simplify your work. My solutions: (a) The square root of a number is always smaller than the number itself. So, in this case, whenever $f(x)$ will be the greatest, its root will also be the greatest for that value of $x$. (b) $g(x) = \sqrt{(3-x)^2 + (0-x^2)^2}$ (c) Because we haven't reached Calculus yet in the book, I suspect that we'll use a graph to determine the result, correct?

I want to show that if $A$ and $B$ are path-connected in $G$, so are $A^{-1}$ and $B^{-1}$. Here is my proof: So let us define $\beta:[0,1]\to \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ by
$$\beta(t)=(\alpha(t))^{-1}$$ Then $\beta(0)=A^{-1}$, $\beta(1)=B^{-1}$, and $\beta(t)\in G \forall t\in[0,1]$. So we only need to show that $\beta$ is continuous. I noticed that
$$\beta(t+\delta)-\beta(t)=\beta(t+\delta)\left[\alpha(t)-\alpha(t+\delta)\right]\beta(t)$$
(Eq. 1) Now here is the step I am not sure. If I can then write
$$||\beta(t+\delta)-\beta(t)||\le||\beta(t+\delta)||||\alpha(t)-\alpha(t+\delta)||||\beta(t)||$$
(Eq. 2) Then let
$$M=\sup_{t\in[0,1]}||\beta(t)||$$
and then $\forall \epsilon$, because $\alpha$ is continuous, $\exists \delta$ s.t.
$$||\alpha(t+\delta)-\alpha(t)||<\frac{\epsilon}{M^2}$$
and hence
$$||\beta(t+\delta)-\beta(t)||<\epsilon$$

1786108,Interpretation of definitions and logical implication in Calculus - e.g. monotonic strictly increasing function,"I read definitions in Calculus books that often confuse me from a logical perspective.

\forall x_1, x_2 \in A ~~~ x_1 < x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) < f(x_2) \tag{1}\label{1}
$$ Now let's try to forget the intuitive knowledge of a strictly increasing function. This definition should pinpoint a class of functions that are OK and a class of functions that are KO. The functions that are OK are the ones for which the property \eqref{1} is TRUE for every $(x_1, x_2)$ couple in $A$. I've circled the TRUE cases in the attached truth table (only the $\Rightarrow$ part for now; 1) 2) 3) 4) and a) b) c) d) are labels). I've been schematic and tried to represent each possible case in the following graphs (the KO cases are marked with an X). The cases that puzzle me are the ones marked with question marks. For example, the $\delta)$ case is an allowed case since the property $\eqref{1}$ is TRUE. In fact, $x_1 < x_2$ is false and $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ is true, giving us TRUE for $\Rightarrow$. This is counterintuitive and either is $\eqref{1}$ or my logic wrong. Another allowed case is $\theta)$, for which $x_1 < x_2$ is false and $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ is false (in fact $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$) so $\Rightarrow$ is TRUE. Admitting for a minute that $\eqref{1}$ may be wrong, I adjusted it as in $\eqref{2}$. $$

$$ This adjustment gets rid of the $\delta$ case but not the $\theta$ one, so I'm logically confused. What is the correct definition of a strictly increasing function if not $\eqref{1}$?

Show that $\phi(N) \leq H$ So this is what I did: Obviously $\phi(N)$ is a subset of H because $N$ is a subset of the domain $G$. Since $N$ is a subgroup of $G$ the identities of $G$ and $N$ are the same, namely: $e_G=e_N$. From this and the properties of homomorphisms it follows that $\phi(e_N)=\phi(e_N e_N)=\phi(e_N)\phi(e_N)=\phi(e_N)=e_H$. So $e_H$ is an element of $\phi(N)$. Suppose now $\phi(N)$ has elements $x$ and $y$ so that $x=\phi(a)$ and $y=\phi(b)$. By definition $a,b \in N$ and since $N$ is a group $ab^{-1} \in N$ as well. Lemma: $\phi(e_G)=\phi(bb^{-1})=\phi(b)\phi(b^{-1})=e_H$. If we multiply the last equation by $\phi(b)^{-1}$ we get $\phi(b)^{-1}\phi(b)\phi(b^{-1})=\phi(b)^{-1} e_H.$ Thus $\phi(b^{-1})=\phi(b)^{-1}$. From the above and the properties of homomorphisms it follows that: $\phi(ab^{-1})=\phi(a)\phi(b^{-1})=\phi(a)\phi(b)^{-1}=xy^{-1}$. So for every $x,y \in \phi(N)$ we have $xy^{-1} \in \phi(N)$ as well. So $\phi(N)$ is closed under multiplication and inverses. Now we have: $\phi(N)$ is a subset of $H$, is closed under multiplication and inverses and has the identity. Therefore $\phi(N)$ is a subgroup of $H$.

$$A(x)=C(x)-\frac{\alpha x}{1-x} A(\alpha x)$$
where $C$ is some particular rational function (although, I'd be interested in solutions for any or every rational $C$). By making infinitely many substitutions of this equation into itself, we can solve this as:
$$A(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{-\alpha^{k+1} x}{1-\alpha^kx}\right)C(\alpha^n x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n\alpha^{n(n+1)/2}x^nC(\alpha^nx)}{(x;\alpha)_n}$$

$$(x;\alpha)_n = \prod_{k=0}^{n-1}(1-x\alpha^k).$$
Is there a simpler form for the sum for $A$? I am hopeful that there is such a form since I the Wikipedia page on q-Pochhammer symbols lists the following identity:
$$(x;q)_{\infty}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^nq^{n(n-1)/2}x^n}{(q;q)_n}$$

What I know about compact operators is the following: I know that they map bounded sets into compact sets (although I've also heard pre-compact sets; not sure 100% if that's true, though). I know that the image of a bounded sequence under a compact operator has a convergent subsequence. Then, I thought perhaps I could use the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem (Let $X$ be a compact metric space and $\{f_{n}\}$ a uniformly bounded equicontinuous sequence of real-valued functions on $X$.

1786495,Estimating the curvature of a discretized curve in 3d with cubic splines,"I have a computer simulation in which I'm modeling a physical curve by discretizing it and updating the locations of these points. I want to find/estimate the location of the maximum curvature of the curve and it seems like a way to approach this is to try and calculate which discretized point has maximum curvature. Note, I never have an actual curve, just the discretized points that are suppose to be representing the curve. So far, the approach I have been thinking about is to estimate the curvature by interpolationg the points with cubic splines and then finding the curvature of the spline at each point. If you think there is a better approach, please let me know, but my questions below will be assuming this approach. My first question is in setting up the cubic splines. Previously, I have only done it for scalar functions of one variable, but the points in question lie on a 3d space curve. The approach I would be inclined to take is to treat the curve parametrically as $\langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle$ and then apply the 1d cubic spline algorithm I know to each component function. Finally, I would apply the curvature formula $\frac{\sqrt{(z''y'-y''z')^2 + (x''z' - z''x')^2 + (y''x'-x''y')^2}}{(x'^2+y'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}}$ from wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature#Curvature_of_space_curves ) at each of the discretized point and find the maximum. Does this seem like a valid approach? Do you think there is an approach that would be better?","['multivariable-calculus', 'spline']"

1786649,Discrete Mathematics: Prove Expression Is Even,"I'm brushing up for my Discrete Math final exam, and would like to know if the following proof is valid... Prove by direct proof that $a^2-5a+8$ is even for any integer $a$ . Proof: By factoring, we achieve $a(a-5)+8$ . Suppose $a$ is an even integer. Then $a(a-5)$ would be even, as the product of an even integer and another integer is an even integer. So, $a(a-5)+8$ would also be even, as the sum of an even integer and an even integer is even. Suppose $a$ is an odd integer. Then $a-5$ would be even, as the difference of two odd integers is even. So, $a(a-5)$ would also be even, as the product of an even integer and another integer is an even integer. So, $a(a-5)+8$ would also be even, as the sum of an even integer and an even integer is even. Therefore, for any integer $a$ , $a^2-5a+8$ will be even. Let me know if this is a valid & satisfactory formal proof, or of anything I could change or improve.
