200855,Confusion on the meaning of confidence interval,"The standard deviation of test scores on a certain achievement test is  10.9. A random sample of 60 scores on this test had a mean of  72.1. Based on this sample, find a 95% confidence interval for the true mean of all scores. The formula for confidence interval in this case is then we look up from the z table we get Confusion starts here : 95% confidence interval means there's 47.5% to the left 47.5% to the right if the sample mean is in the middle Suppose that our sample mean, 72.1, is below the actual mean of the population. We have the following graph, just by looking at the graph, you can tell there's more area under the curve to the right of 72.1 than there is area to the left How is it possible that the area to the left is 47.5% and area to the right is 47.5% ?? im confused.....How can we say that confidence interval is equal distant $\approx$ 2.758 (distance to the left and distance to the right) from the sample mean? the graph above is the sampling distribution of sample means",['statistics']

In terms of $f^{-1}$, we see that $$\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)\, dx = \int_{0}^{1}f^{-1}(y)\, dy.$$ The way I saw this was by drawing an $f(x)$ and noticing that if I integrate in $y$ instead, the left handed integral becomes the right handed integral.

200926,How are tangent spaces defined through equivalence classes of curves?,"I have a doubt about the definition of the tangent space to a manifold $M$ using equivalence classes of smooth curves. I understood the definition using derivations, which in the end uses curves showing that each curve defines a derivation which is it's tangent vector. But I hear there's a definition which says that a vector is an equivalence class of curves. I really don't understand what that's supposed to mean. I'm associating a vector with a curve? But the vector shouldn't be associated with the derivative of the curve? I know what's an equivalence class, but I really don't understand how this fits into this definition. I know those questions may seem silly, but I think it's important to know how to construct the tangent space both as equivalence class of smooth cuvers and as derivations.

Therefore for any $\epsilon > 0$ , $\exists N:$ $|b_n - a_n - (M - L)| <\epsilon$ whenever $n > N$ Take $\epsilon = L - M$ and we get $|b_n - a_n - (M - L)| <L -M$ whenever $n > N$ and since $a \leq |a|$ , we have $b_n - a_n - (M - L) < L -M \iff a_n >b_n$ , but this contradicts the assumption and therefore $L > M$ must be false","['sequences-and-series', 'limits']"

$$
(Df,g) = \int_0^\infty f''\overline g dx = ... = \left. (f'\overline g - f \overline g') \right|_0^{\infty} + (f, D^*g).
$$ To satisfy adjointness we should zero out free term with fixed $g$ and for all $f \in D_D$ - domain of D 
$$
 \left. (f'\overline g - f \overline g') \right|_0^{\infty} = 0.
$$ Second term in it zero outs because of $f(0) = 0$, so 
$$
\left. (f'\overline g ) \right|_0^{\infty} = 0.
$$ Because $f$ arbitrary from domain of $D$ and hence can have not zero first derivative, so this equality holds for fixed $g$ if and only if 
$$g(0) = 0.$$ Thus domain of direct and adjoint operator the same, which means that it is self-adjoint. What I see in article. Boris Pavlov wrote :

This operator is symmetric and it’s adjoint $L^+_0$ is defined by the same differential expression on all square integrable functions with square integrable derivatives of the first and second order and no additional boundary condition at the origin. Where is error? It certainly is, because operator $D$ with domain $f'(0)=\alpha f(0)$ is symmetric, It's domain is superset of regarded in my message domain hence my operator is not maximal symmetric and hence can not be self-adjoint.","['operator-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'differential-operators']"

Based on this result, is it true that if there is a global change of variables which makes $g_{ij}=\delta_{ij}$ hold then this change of varibles can also be considered as locally at each point on the surface,  thus by above result the Gauss curvature of each point on the surface is zero?","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

201217,Visualizing Infinity discerning countable and uncountable,"This is rather a philosophical question. Although it uses topological notions, it isn't any precise mathematics, so maybe one cannot take it very seriously. Sometimes I try to picture an infinite set of points. Assuming that the space $E$ in which my visual imagination takes place is a simply connected bounded subspace of the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$, I can only visualize at most uncountably many points. But since $E$ is separable, so is every subspace and I can't really explicitly imagine uncountably many points, e.g. having a circle in mind: I couldn't decide whether there only lie denumerably points on it or not. I could decide for myself that there are uncountably many, but this I would consider cheating. But I sometimes try to explicity imagine a countable set, viz as discrete, which isn't possible for uncountable sets, again because $E$ is separable. Since it's also bounded such a subset cannot be closed therein, for otherwise it would be compact, and therefore finite. One example would be the set $\{\tfrac{1}{n};\; n\in\mathbb{N}\}$, but here again it's hard for me to tell if its visualization is indeed denumerable. This might be due to the feeling that visualized points have an actual ""size"" in my mind.
And it seems that any bounded countable discrete set must locally look like this particular set because it must have an accumulation point outside of it. Or maybe one can determine that such a visualization is in fact denumerable? The problem for me seems to be the phenomenon of an accumulation point, and I feel that there's no hope if ""too many"" of such points are actually in the set. I just don't know how many ""too many"" exactly is. Maybe one is already too much. And maybe it's enough if there's any accumulation point at all, i.e. not even in the set. In that case, it would be impossible (if my argumentation isn't wrong or an assumption too strict). So my question would be if this is the end of this discussion or not? Is there any, maybe completely alternative, way of visualizing a countable set knowing it isn't uncountable?

$$\ddot{Z}=0   \ \ \ => \ \ \ Z=Ct+D$$ Then the soln to the particular case I wasn't quite as sure but this is what I tried: let $Z = pt^2 + qcos(\omega t)$ where p, q are arbitrary then
$$\dot Z = 2pt - q\omega sin(\omega t)$$ $$\ddot Z = 2p - q(\omega)^2 cos(\omega t)$$ and thus: $$2p - q(\omega)^2 cos(\omega t) = A+Bcos(\omega t)$$ $=>$ $$p=A/2 ; q = \frac{-B}{(\omega)^2}$$ which would give us our soln: $$Z =Ct + D + (A/2)t^2 - \frac{B}{(\omega)^2}cos(\omega t)$$ Is this right ?! and if so, is this the most efficient method of solving this ODE? ..... If this is right, I have an intial condition that : $$ t=0, => \dot Z = 0 $$ which solves to $C=0$ and $$Z = D + (A/2)t^2 - \frac{B}{(\omega)^2}cos(\omega t)$$ Which is obviously not unique, and I was wondering about the significance of the undetermined parameter D.

Right after that he states that $g$ is a one-to-one correspondence. As an example of this construction I tried $f: X \to Y$, $f(x)= x^{2}$, with $X=\{-3, -2, 2, 3\}$ and $Y=\{4, 9, 11\}$. In this case: $$R=\{(-3, -3), (-3, 3), (3,3), (3, -3), (-2, -2), (-2, 2), (2, 2), (2, -2)\}$$ and
$$X/R=\{\{-3, 3\}, \{-2, 2\}\}.$$
And for each element $y$ in $Y$,
$$g(4)=\{-2, 2\};$$
$$g(9)=\{-3, 3\};$$
$$g(11)=\{\}.$$
But then, $g(11)=\{\} \notin X/R$, when $g(11)$ should be an equivalence class of $R$. Probably there's some gross mistake above. I'd appreciate if someone could point it to me. Thanks!",['elementary-set-theory']

I have a ""construction"" that works in the following manner: Step 1: Remove an arbitrary $x_1\in A$ from $A$ to come up with the set $A_1 = A - \{x_1\}$, and for $n=2,\ldots,N$, Step n: Remove an arbitrary $x_n \in A_{n-1}$ from $A_{n-1}$ to come up with the set $A_n = A- \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$. It can be shown that for any $n$, we have $\inf_{x\in A_n}|x-y| = 0,\,\forall{y\in [0,1]}$  as well. That is, removing finitely many terms from $A$, we still get $0$. I cannot guarantee though that repeating the above process infinitely many times I still get $0$, as I may have removed all the elements of $A$. My first question is why this is happening?

But now, I guess, even if I repeat the steps of this new construction infinitely many times, I would still get $0$ as my final answer. How can I prove this? In general, I have a construction in which I repeat some well-defined steps infinitely many times; how can I verify the correctness of my final answer?

201603,Pathologies in module theory,"Linear algebra is a very well-behaved part of mathematics. Soon after you have mastered the basics you got a good feeling for what kind of statements should be true -- even if you are not familiar with all major results and counterexamples. If one replaces the underlying field by a ring, and therefore looks at modules, things become more tricky. Many pathologies occur that one maybe would not expect coming from linear algebra. I am looking for a list of such pathologies where modules behave differently than vector spaces. This list should not only be a list of statements but all phenomena should be illustrated by an example. To start the list I will post an answer below with all pathologies that I know from the top of my head. This should also explain better what kind of list I have in mind.","['vector-spaces', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'big-list', 'modules']"

We know that $N \rtimes_{\phi} H = N \times H$ if and only if $\phi$ is trivial, but this question is a bit different. Does $N \rtimes_{\phi} H \cong N \times H$ imply that $\phi$ is trivial? My first idea is that there should be a counterexample, but I haven't been able to figure out anything yet. Since nontrivial semidirect products are always nonabelian, we definitely need at least one of $N$ or $H$ nonabelian. I think finding a counterexample to the statement would also be equivalent to finding $G$ such that $G = NH = N'H'$ where $N \cap H = N' \cap H' = 1$ $N \cong N'$ and $H \cong H'$ $N, N', H' \trianglelefteq G$  but $H$ is not normal in $G$","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
201732,What is it called when a function is not continuous but still can have a derivative?,"Consider the following function (I think it has a name, but I don't remember it):
$$

0 & $x = 0$ \\

$$ $f'(x)$ is zero everywhere except at $x=0$, where $f$ is not continuous. But suppose we ignore the right half of the real line and define $f(0)$ to be $-1$. Then $f$ has a left derivative at $x=0$, and it is zero. We can do the same thing from the right, so in a way it could make a little bit of sense to say that $f'(0) =0$. Of course, I understand that going by the definition $f$ isn't differentiable at $x=0$. But one could imagine an alternative definition of derivative for discontinous functions, in which one calculates lateral derivatives by redefining the function to be continuous, and then we see if the lateral derivatives match. This doesn't always work; for example it's hard to meaningfully assign a derivative to $x \mapsto |x|$ at $x=0$. Are there other functions with this property?
