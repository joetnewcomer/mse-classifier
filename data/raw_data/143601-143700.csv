2335046,Area of plane inside cylinder; problem with parametrization of plane,"I'm being asked to find the surface area of a plane defined by $x+y+z=a$ inside a cylinder defined by $x^2+y^2=a^2$ and I thought, ""simple enough, I'll just use the normal vector and integrate its norm over a polar domain with $0\leq r\leq a$ and $0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi$"". Sure enough, that seems to give the correct solution, according to my solution sheet: $$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^a\sqrt{3}r\,dr\,d\theta = \int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2\,d\theta = \sqrt{3}\pi a^2$$ But let's say I want to use a parametrization $r(s,t)$ for the plane such as $r(s,t)=(a+ta+sa,-ta,-sa)$. That seems to be a correct parametrization, and it gives a normal vector $r_s \times r_t = (-a^2,-a^2,-a^2)$. Now the norm of this is $\sqrt{3}a^2$, which is gonna mess up the result obtained above. Is there a necessity for a change of variables due to the parametrization of the plane? I'm honestly out of ideas... It seems like the surface area of the plane would depend on the chosen normal vector, which is ridiculous. (edit: $a$ is some scalar.)",['multivariable-calculus']
2335048,Using Rolle's Theorem to Prove the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem,"Sorry for the broad title. The question is too long to fit in the title. Here is the question: Let $\space f,g: \space [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \space$ be differentiable functions with $\space g'(x) \neq 0 \space$ for all $\space x\in (a,b).$ Suppose we define the following function: $$h: \space [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ With $\space h(x)=f(x)-kg(x)$ . Using Rolle's theorem for a suitable choice of $\space k \space$ ; prove that there exists a real number $\space c\in (a,b) \space$ such that: $${f'(c)\over g'(c)} = {{f(b)-f(a)}\over {g(b)-g(a)}}$$ I gave it a try, but not sure if I'm right. Here is what I did: For Rolle's Theorem to  be applied, we require $\space h(a)=h(b) \space $ . In other words: $$f(a)-kg(a) = f(b)-kg(b)$$ By rearranging, we get: $$f(a)-f(b) = kg(a)-kg(b)$$ $$f(a)-f(b) = k \big(g(a)-g(b) \big)$$ $${{f(a)-f(b)}\over {g(a)-g(b)}} = {{f(b)-f(a)}\over {g(b)-g(a)}} = k$$ Which gives us the equality: $${f'(c)\over g'(c)} = k$$ Here is where I get confused. Is this what it's asking me to do? Or have I dived into the uncharted and gone in the completely wrong direction (won't be my first time haha).","['derivatives', 'rolles-theorem', 'functions']"
2335051,Determine all convex polyhedra with $6$ faces,"I want to determine all convex polyhedra with 6 faces ( not necessarily regular). Based on the Euler characteristic, $v-e+f=2$, we know that $v-e+6=2$, or $v+4=e$. Let $n_i$ be the number of edges on the $i$th face. Then $\sum n_i=2e$. Each face has at least $3$ edges, so each $n_i \geq 3$. No face can have more than $5$ edges (because if there were a hexagonal face, it would have to meet $6$ other distinct faces, causing there to be more than $6$ total faces). So each $n_i \leq 5$. We know there are at least $5$ vertices, since the only convex polyhedron with $4$ vertices is the tetrahedron. Since no face has more than $5$ edges, no face has more than $5$ vertices. So there are at most $5 \cdot 6 = 30$ vertices, but this over counts. Each vertex is incident to at least $3$ faces, so is counted at least $3$ times. Thus we get the upper bound $v \leq 30/3=10$. Thus $5 \leq v \leq 10$ and using the Euler characteristic we get $9 \leq e \leq 14$, so $18 \leq 2e = \sum n_i \leq 28$. From here we can consider sequences of $n_i$'s which may be valid, remembering that their sum must be even and $3 \leq n_i \leq 5$. The possibilities are: $(3,3,3,3,3,3)$ $(3,3,3,3,3,5)$ $(3,3,3,3,4,4)$ $(3,3,3,3,5,5)$ $(3,3,3,4,4,5)$ $(3,3,3,5,5,5)$ $(3,3,4,4,5,5)$ $(3,4,4,4,4,5)$ $(3,4,4,5,5,5)$ $(3,5,5,5,5,5)$ $(4,4,4,4,4,4)$ $(4,4,4,4,5,5)$ $(4,4,5,5,5,5)$ 1 is the triangular bipyramid, 2 is the pentagonal pyramid, 3 I don't know the name for but is realized in the image below by ""popping out"" a triangular face of the square pyramid. 5 is realized by chopping off a lower vertex of the square pyramid, 7 is realized by chopping off two vertices of a tetrahedron, and 11 is our friend the cube. My friends and I think the rest are not possible. Note that any pentagonal face must touch every other face. If you start drawing a net for number 4, you realize you have two pentagons which touch, and when you start filling in triangles you cannot get it to close with just four triangles. Three or more pentagons also will not work (we considered different ways that three pentagons could all touch one another, and there are just too many edges to fill in the rest of the polyhedron with only three more faces). This rules out 6, 9, 10, and 13. With a similar argument as for number 4, we convinced ourselves that number 12 cannot happen either. Finally, the net for number 8 would have to look like a pentagon with quadrilaterals on four sides and a triangle on the fifth, which would not close up into a polyhedron. Here are our questions: 1. Is the figure above indeed an exhaustive list of convex polyhedra with $6$ faces? Can this list be found anywhere? (Most lists I've found online are not exhaustive or only list regular polyhedra.) 2. Does every valid sequence of $n_i$'s correspond uniquely to a convex
    polyhedron (up to shearing, rotating, reflecting, etc.)? 3. Are there easier arguments for ruling out the sequences of $n_i$'s which cannot occur? The arguments we used (which I have not written rigorously here) rely on a lot of case analysis.","['polyhedra', 'convex-geometry', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'geometry']"
2335052,For which $n$ does $\{a^2:a\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ contain the additive inverse of each element modulo $n$?,"Take $S=\{a^2:a\in\mathbb{Z}\}$. Now, for which $n$ does $S$ contain the additive inverse of each element modulo $n$? For all $a,b,x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$ we have:
$$(ax+by)^2\equiv-(ay-bx)^2\pmod{a^2+b^2}$$
and since all numbers $n\equiv 1\pmod 4$ can be written as the sum of two coprime squares, we can find $a,b\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $ax+by$ can take on all values in $\Bbb{Z}$, so the above congruences is enough to show the existance of inverses. The congruence doesn't work with numbers $n\equiv 3\pmod 4$, since those can't be written as the sum of two squares. Numbers of the form $n\equiv 0\pmod 4$ can't be written as the sum of two coprime squares, so that doesn't work either. $n\equiv 2\pmod 4$ seems to work sometimes. The first few 'non-trivial' (read: not congruent to $1\pmod 4$) values of $n$ I found were:
$$2,10,26,34,50,58,74,82$$ Question: is there a simple (fast) way to determine for any given $n\in\Bbb{N}$ whether or not $S$ does contain the additive inverse of each element modulo $n$? I found A008784 which appears to have all values of $n$. Apparentely these are the positive integers with prime factors all of the form $4k+1$ except for at most one factor of $2$, but I can't seem to find a proof of that. Edit: as Thomas Andrews points out, not all numbers congruent to $1$ modulo $4$ can be expressed as sums of two squares, though I'm pretty sure primes congruent to $1$ modulo $4$ can.","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"
2335075,Are there any solvers to Chance Constrained Programming Problems?,"I'm trying to solve a chance constrained programming (CCP) problem $\min_x f_0(x, \xi), \text{ such that } \mathbb{P} ( f_i(x, \xi) \ge \alpha_i ) \le \epsilon_i, \text{ where } i = 1,2,\cdots, m$ Most of approaches to solve CCP problems are reformulating the chance constraint into some computationally tractable forms. For example, the chance constraint $\mathbb{P}(\xi^\intercal x \ge b) \le \epsilon $ can be rewritten in 3 different ways (not equivalent) assume $\xi$ satisfies a Gaussian distribution $\xi \sim N(\bar{\xi}, \Sigma)$, then $\mathbb{P}(\xi^\intercal x \ge b) \le \epsilon $ is equivalent with $b - \bar{\xi}^\intercal x \ge \Phi^{-1}(1-\epsilon) || \Sigma^{1/2} x ||_2 $. This is a deterministic Second Order Cone Constraint. which is convex and will not cause intractable issues.

The key idea is to obtain a deterministic optimization problem whose optimal solution is suboptimal to the original CCP problem.
I will not write their solutions here since I don't want to scare you away. All these approaches are reformulating the chance constraint into some computationally tractable forms (by which I mean current solvers like gruobi/cplex/mosek could handle).

2335123,Curve embedding in $\mathbb{P}^3$ - role of divisors,"I'm following a course in algebraic geometry and have a question about the fact that every non-singular curve can be embedded in $\mathbb{P}^3$. You should be aware that I have almost no background in algebraic geometry. When I assume that the curve $X$ lies already in some $\mathbb{P}^m$ it is doable. It is done by taking a point $P \in \mathbb{P}^m \backslash X$ outside the curve and project the curve from the point onto a hyperplane $H \cong \mathbb{P}^{m-1}$, this works when $m \geq 4$. The conditions $P$ has to fulfil are the following: $P$ is not on any secant line of $X$, $P$ is not on any tangent line of $X$. By my very limited background it is hard to understand many things from the book of Hartshorne. Does anyone has a good reference on this subject? I would also like to ask what divisors and linear systems precisely do and how they come into play? Note: This is a follow-up to a previous post on the same subject. The new question is specifically about the role of divisors in this construction. This issue was raised, but not addressed, in the comments beneath an answer in the previous post, which is why it is asked as a separate question here.","['algebraic-curves', 'projective-space', 'algebraic-geometry', 'divisors-algebraic-geometry']"

2335196,Commutative ring category is not additive category,"I was told that commutative ring category is not additive category all the time and it is thus not abelian category. A category is additive if $Hom(A,B)$ is abelian group for all objects $A,B$ and morphisms satisfy distributive laws, it has zero objects and it has finite coproduct and products. It seems commutative ring satisfies most of the requirement except $Hom(A,B)$ being abelian group. $Hom(A,B)$ is not abelian group by taking any $f\in Hom(A,B)$. If $f$ has inverse $g$, I can check $g(a_1a_2)=f(a_1a_2)$ which never cancels out with $f(a_1a_2)$. It definitely satisfies distributive laws of morphisms.(Wrong. Distributive law fails due to not fixing $1$.) Zero object is 0 ring as identity element is $0$ in 0 ring. Coproduct is tensor and product is direct sum.

2335209,$f$ irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ implies $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$,"Let $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be a non-constant polynomial and let $p$ be a prime number which is not a divisor of the leading coefficient of $f$. I need to prove that if $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, then $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. I decided to approach this proof by proving the contrapositive: i.e., that $f$ is reducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ $\implies $ $f$ is reducible over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. Now, it is certainly the case that $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, if $f$ reducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ implies that $f$ is reducible over $\mathbb{Z}$. So, the proof therefore reduces to showing that $f$ reducible in $\mathbb{Z} \implies$ $f$ reducible in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. To that effect, suppose $f$ is reducible in $\mathbb{Z}$. Then, $\exists g,h \in \mathbb{Z}[x] $ such that $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$. Now, the fact that $p$ is not a divisor of the leading coefficient of $f$ means that when we reduce $\,f \mod p$ (call this result $\overline{f}$), $f$ and $\overline{f}$ have the same degree. From this point, I am not sure how to proceed. It seems to make sense to me intuitively that if we reduce $\, f \mod p$, we can reduce $\, g \mod p$ and $\, h \mod p\,$ as well so that we will have shown that $\overline{f}$ is factorable/reducible. But, I'm not sure how to show this in a rigorous way. Could anyone please help me on how I should proceed?

I think that $\sqrt{z} = k \pi$ with $k \in \mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$. Then: For instance $ \sqrt{z} = \pi$ implies $e^{\frac{\log(|z|) + i\angle{z}}{2}} = \pi$ and therefore $\sqrt{|z|} e^{i\frac{\angle{z}}{2}} = \pi$ then $|z| = \pi^2$ and $\angle{z} = 4k\pi$ with $k\in \mathbb{Z}$ therefore $z = \pi^2 e^{i 4k\pi}$ On the other side  $\sqrt{z} = -\pi$ implies $e^{\frac{\log(|z|) + i\angle{z}}{2}} = -\pi$ hence $\sqrt{|z|} e^{i\frac{\angle{z}}{2}} = -\pi$ therefore $|z| = \pi^2$ and $\angle{z} = (4k + 2)\pi$ with $k\in \mathbb{Z}$ hence $z = \pi^2 e^{i(4k+2)\pi}$ Therefore the zeros are $$z \in \{(k\pi)^2 e^{i4p\pi}| k,p \in \mathbb{Z}, k\neq 0\} \cup \{(k\pi)^2 e^{i(4p+2)\pi}| k,p \in \mathbb{Z}, k\neq 0\} = \{(k\pi)^2 e^{i2p\pi}| k,p \in \mathbb{Z}, k\neq 0\} = \{(k\pi)^2| k \in \mathbb{Z}^*\}$$ Is it correct?","['complex-analysis', 'roots', 'proof-verification']"

2335258,A module that has a basis shorter than its rank?,"Rank has been defined to me as the maximum number of elements of M which are linearly independent, allowing the rank to be $0$ if the module is of torsion, or $\infty$ if there is no maximum. Now, the course is based pretty much on the book Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote, and there the rank is defined to be as the length of a basis of $M$ (assume $M$ has a finite basis and that $R$ is commutative with $1$ here to have a well defined rank). We now are seeing the following theorem: Let $R$ be a PID and $M$ a free module of rank $n$ . Then any submodule $N$ of $M$ satisfies: (1) $N$ is free of rank less than $n$ . (2) There is a basis $y_1,...,y_n$ of $M$ such that $r_1y_1,...,r_ty_t$ is a basis for $N$ , for some $t \le n$ . I think that, according to my definition, the length of the basis' of M doesn't have to be n. It certainly can't be more than n, cause then the elements would be l.d., but it could be less than n. In consequence, the assertion (2) makes no sense a priori. My question is whether the fact that $R$ is a PID and $M$ is a free module over $R$ implies that both definitions of rank coincide (i.e., that the maximum number of l.i. elements is also the length of a basis's of $M$ ), or whether this was just a mistake due to my professor giving a different definition of rank.","['abstract-algebra', 'modules']"

2335334,Frobenius Method general solution not providing an expected solution,"I'm trying to solve the following ODE:

3\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } {(n+r-1)(n+r)}a_{n} x^{n+r-1} +\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } {(n+r)}a_{n} x^{n + r-1} +  3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } {(n+r-1)}a_{n-1} x^{n + r -1} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } a_{n-1} x^{n + r - 1} = 0 $$ In order to make all sums start from the $n=1$: $$ \tag{2}
 3r(r-1)a_{0}x^{r-1} + ra_{0}x^{r-1} + 3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } {(n+r-1)(n+r)}a_{n} x^{n+r-1} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } {(n+r)}a_{n} x^{n + r-1} + 3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty } {(n+r-1)}a_{n-1} x^{n + r -1} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty } a_{n-1} x^{n + r - 1} = 0   
$$ If I understood correctly, the indicial equation should then be:
$$ 3r(r-1)a_{0}x^{r-1} + ra_{0}x^{r-1} = 0 $$ and since $x^{r-1} \neq 0 $ and $a_{0} \neq 0 $: $$ 3r(r-1) + r = 0 $$
$$ r_{1} = 0 $$
$$ r_{2} = \frac{2}{3} $$ From $(2)$: $$ [3(n+r)(n+r-1)+(n+r)]a_{n} + [3(n+r-1)+1]a_{n-1} = 0
$$
which seems to give for both solutions of $r$:
$$ a_{n} = \frac{-a_{n-1}}{n}  $$
It seems to me that this is in terms of $a_{0}$: $$ a_{n} = \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!}a_{0} $$ So rewriting $(1)$ now would give me the solution and $y$ would be an infinite sum since all $a_{n} \neq 0$.

It'd be easy to note that $L(x)$ is the logarithmic function, so all these things hold, but since we haven't discussed logarithms in class, I suppose this exercise is built to derive some of its properties. My work: a) Note how $\frac 1t$ is continuous on $(0,\infty)$ ; it follow immediately that $L(x)$ is differentiable and $L'(x)=1/x$ . Note also how $1/x>0$ for all $x>0$ . Because of this, $L(x)$ is strictly increasing. b) Consider $L(1)=\int_1^1\frac1t dt=0$ . (Fundamental theorem of calculus) Since $L(x)$ is strictly increasing, $L(2)>L(1)=0$ . c) No significant results, as I don't want to use the logarithm for this. d) Let $n\geq 0$ , then this follows immediately from c) . For $n<0$ I've tried to play around with the fundamental theorem of calculus but didn't get to any significant result. e) Note how $L(x)$ is strictly increasing and thus injective. To prove that $L(x)$ is on to, we have to take an arbitrary $y\in\mathbb{R}$ and show that $L(x)=y$ for some $x\in (0,\infty)$ . I can intuitively see how this would be the case and that it could probably be proven without use of logarithms, but find it difficult to come up with any sort of formal argument.

2335550,Significance of the Triangle Inequality,"After working through a few problems regarding the Cauchy Integral Formula, I'm still a little confused on the significance of the triangle inequality. Why do we use it and what information does it tell us? See the following example below. Determine $\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{(x^2 + 1)^2} dx$ First, we'll create the contour $$ \begin{cases} C_1: Rt & -1 \le t \le 1 \\ C_2:R e^{i\theta} & \ \ \, 0 \le \theta \le \pi \\ C=C_1+C_2 \end{cases} $$ $$ x^2 +1 =0 \Rightarrow x=\pm i \ \ \  ; \ \ \ \ \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{(x^2 + 1)^2} dx = \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{(x^2 + 1)^2} dx$$ $$ \Rightarrow \int_C \frac{z^2}{(z+1)^2}dz = \int_C \frac{z^2}{[(z+i)(z-i)]^2} 
 = \int_C \frac{z^2}{(z+i)^2 (z-i)^2} $$ $z=-i$ is outside the contour and therefore irrelevant, so choosing $z=i$ for the integration. $$ \Rightarrow z_0=i \ \ \text{and} \ \ f(z)=\frac{z^2}{(z+i)^2} $$
$$ f'(z)=\frac{d}{dz}\left[ \frac{z^2}{(z+i)^2} \right] = \frac{2z}{(z+i)^2}-\frac{2z^2}{(z+i)^3}$$ Therefore, by the Cauchy Integration Formula, 
$$ \int_C \frac{f(z)}{(z-i)^2}dz = 2\pi i f'(i) = 2\pi i \left[ \frac{2i}{(2i)^2}-\frac{2i^2}{(2i)^3} \right] = \pi \left[1 + \frac{2}{4i^2} \right] = \pi - \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{2} $$ The following part is where I'm a little confused. I know the work, but am not quite sure why I'm doing it or what the end result is telling us. So, by the triangle inequality, $$ \left| z^2 +1 \right|^2 \le \left( \left|z^2 \right| +1 \right) ^2 = z^4 +2\left| z^2 \right| +1 \Rightarrow \left| \int_C \frac{z^2}{(z+1)^2}dz \right| \le \frac{R^2}{R^4 +2R +1} $$ $$ \Rightarrow \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{(x^2 + 1)^2} dx = \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{(x^2 + 1)^2} dx \le \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} \int_C \frac{z^2}{(z+1)^2}dz \\ \le \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} \frac{R^2}{R^4 +2R +1} = 0 $$ $$ \therefore \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{(x^2 + 1)^2} dx = \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{(x^2 + 1)^2} dx = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{\pi}{2} \right] = \frac{\pi}{4} $$ Any help in deciphering the part in the work I pointed out would be very helpful, thank you for your time.","['cauchy-integral-formula', 'complex-analysis']"

$$\langle T, v \rangle = \int_\Omega (\bar uv + \nabla \bar u \cdot \nabla v),\qquad \forall v \in H^1_0(\Omega)$$

$$a(u, v) = \int_0^1 u'v' + \int_0^1 uv \color{red}{=} {(u, v)}_{H^1_0(0, 1)}$$

I noticed that the covariance matrix which should get updated over each iteration is not symmetric. I am debugging through MATLAB. 
I know that P should be symmetric and stay symmetric. What does it mean if the covariance matrix is not symmetric? Where it could be the error? EDIT: Any covariance matrix MUST be symmetric no matter what. The symmetry comes from its definition. The covariance tells you how two variables are related and therefore if $x$ is related to $y$ also $y$ will be related to $x$ and of course in the same way. My problem was that I was checking with the MATLAB function issymmetric(A) if the matrix $A$ was symmetric. 
Apparently that function checks for exact symmetry and therefore if the involved matrixes are computed numerically and therefore it is not exactly symmetric it will give you false / 0 as a result. But, if for the same matrix I checked A-A' I had something of the order of 1e-15 . Thanks in advance.","['matlab', 'kalman-filter', 'covariance', 'linear-algebra']"

We've learnt the basics, then the convergence criteria, and how to get the taylor expansion of some basic functions like $e^x$ and $\ln(x+1)$. After that we dealt with finding the sum of a specific series. If you had a series $\sum{a_n}$ you would take a part of it and put it as $x$ and then define a function in that way. For example: For $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n(n+1)}$$ the defined function was (seemingly defined out of nowhere) $f:[-1,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ $$f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{x^{n+1}}{n(n+1)}$$ and we noticed that the second derivative of the given function looked nicely. Then we applied some basic integral identities, and basically from there on it was understandable.$\\$ The next example was $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{(-1)^n\cdot n}{(2n+1)!}}$$ and again the beginning looked like this: we define a function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ as $$f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{(-1)^n\cdot n}{(2n+1)!} \cdot x^{2n+1}}$$ and then through totally random number manipulation we achieved $f(1) = (\cos{1} - \sin{1})/2$ and then of course it's understandable since the Taylor expansions of $\sin$ and $\cos$ are available to us even during the tests.$\\$ Now, I'm having a really hard time figuring out how this works, these examples were the only ones shown to us, and I've unsuccessfully tried solving the problems left to us for practicing this method.

This is also has the nice side-effect that, for any continuous linear operator $T:E\rightarrow F$, $*(T):F^*\rightarrow E^*$ is the adjoint operator $T^*$ (and indeed, some more categorical treatments of functional analysis define the adjoint this way). However, usually in category theory when one says that an object is the ""dual"", this refers to taking the dual of some universal mapping property: for example, the coproduct is the object which satisfies the dual UMP of the product.

Then $\phi(u)=u$ for every $u \in \mathbb{Q}$, so that $\phi(\sqrt{n})^2=\phi(n)=n$. If $\phi(\sqrt{n})=a+b\sqrt{m}$ for some $a,b\in\mathbb{Q}$, then $(a+b\sqrt{m})^2=a^2+b^2m + 2ab\sqrt{m}=n$ implies
$$a^2+b^2m = n$$ and $$2ab=0.$$ Then $b=0$ cannot happen since that would imply that $\sqrt{n}\in\mathbb{Q}$, where $n$ is a square-free integer. Also $a=b=0$ cannot happen. Hence $a=0$ and we have $$b^2m=n.$$
If $\psi:\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})\to\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$ were an isomorphism then there would exist some $s\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $$s^2m=n,$$ then $s=b$ or $s=-b$.

What I would like to be able to do is apply some sort of effective chain rule for quaternionic differentiation to calculate the time derivative: $$\dot{\mathbf{p}}=\frac{\partial\mathbf{p}}{\partial\mathbf{q}}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{q}}$$ Where the dot operator ($\cdot$) represents the usual quaternion multiplication. With some effort, I believe that I have shown that $\mathbf{p}$ is quaternionic holomorphic and that its quaternionic derivative with respect to $\mathbf{q}$ is exactly what you'd expect: $$\frac{\partial\mathbf{p}}{\partial\mathbf{q}} = \tau\mathbf{q}^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{p} = \tau\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{q}^{-1}=\tau\mathbf{q}^{\tau-1}$$ Unfortunately, when I try different functions for $\mathbf{q}\left(t\right)$ and the above chain rule, I don't get the actual rate of change of the function $\mathbf{p}\left(t\right)$, which I am estimating numerically.

2336318,Understanding solutions to the Mathieu Equation in the context of Classical Mechanics,"I have have two questions concerning the following system in Classical Mechanics . I will list them here and then give some context in which I will note where the questions occur. The Questions (1) Is it the case that the Mathieu Characteristic Functions have a ""frequency"" half that of the parametric driving term? If so, are there conditions that must be met or is it a general fact? (2) Is there any way to facially distinguish between periodic and divergent solutions to this system? Why do small changes in the parameters of the Mathieu equation sometimes result in huge transitions in the solution space? The Problem Consider a simple pendulum whose hinge is attached to the end of a Hooke's Law spring hanging from the ceiling. Assume that the spring and the hinge of the pendulum are both massless and that the the hinge (and spring) is constrained to vertical motion only. The pendulum is free to swing in the plane. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$, the length of the pendulum is $l$, the mass of the pendulum bob is $m$, and the spring constant is $k$. Taking $\theta$ to be the angle with which the pendulum swings from the vertical and $D$ to be the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium length, this system has the following Lagrangian :
$$
\mathscr L=\frac{1}{2}m\dot D^2+\frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot\theta^2+ml\sin(\theta)\dot D \dot\theta - \frac{1}{2}kD^2-mgD+mlg\cos(\theta)
$$ Applying the Euler-Lagrange Equation for each dynamical variable yields the following equations of motion:
$$
\ddot\theta=-\frac{\sin(\theta)}{l}\ddot D-\frac{\sin(\theta)}{l}g\\
\ddot D+l\cos(\theta)\dot\theta^2+l\sin(\theta)\ddot\theta=-\frac{k}{m}D-g
$$ Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $\ddot\theta$ and applying the small angle approximation (ignoring all $\theta$ terms of quadratic order or higher) yields
$$
\ddot D+l\dot\theta^2=-\frac{k}{m}D-g
$$
We can eliminate the non-linear term by requiring $\dot\theta\ll\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}$. The remaining equation is the simple harmonic motion equation with a constant driving force. Solving this equation with appropriate initial conditions yields
$$
D(t)=\frac{mg}{k}\cos(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t)-\frac{mg}{k}
$$ Taking two derivatives and substituting this solution into the first differential equation above (still under the small angle approximation, of course) yields
$$
\ddot\theta+(\frac{g}{l}-\frac{g}{l}\cos(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}t))\theta=0
$$ This is a slightly modified Mathieu Equation which produces the following even solution given appropriate initial conditions (i.e. $\theta(0)=\theta_0$)
$$
\theta (t)=\theta_0 C(\frac{4mg}{kl},\frac{2mg}{kl},\sqrt{\frac{k}{4m}}t)
$$ I have been told that the pendulum ought to naturally oscillate with a frequency half that of the spring's. The reasoning being that the pendulum passes through its equilibrium position (where the tension in the rod is greatest) twice in every period. This position should correspond to the maximum downward displacement of the spring since the hinge is massless. Assuming that what is meant by ""frequency"" is related to the pendulum's perceived, visual swing rather than a true mathematical repetition, then a little testing produces examples where this appears to be at least approximately true ( example 1 , example 2 ). However, I have heard that this halving of the frequency is closely related to Floquet's Theorem , but that doesn't seem right since it is easy to find examples that definitely don't have half the ""frequency"" if one does not restrict one's solutions too much ( example 3 ). Moreover, it is simple to find solutions which quickly diverge, and surprisingly, these solutions are not very different from bounded solutions ( example 4 , example 5 ). The Questions Re-stated Is it possible to identify bounded or divergent solutions simply by looking at their parameters? Is there a hard-and-fast relationship between the frequency of the spring and the ""frequency"" of the pendulum? How does this relationship relate to Floquet's Theorem?","['periodic-functions', 'euler-lagrange-equation', 'special-functions', 'classical-mechanics', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

2336401,Why is adding the same as extending a length?,"I've come to realize that the more I study some math subjects the more I question some results or ideas that seemed trivial or obvious to me. My question is about the real numbers and their geometric interpretation as a line. I get that real numbers being complete and ordered are naturally visualized as a number line. Now, consider two positive numbers $a$ and $b$ and find them in the number line. We define the binary operation $a•b$ like this: ""take a compass and open it from O to $b$, now draw a circle with such compass with $a$ as its center. The point on the right where the circle intersects the line is $a•b$"". This, of course, corresponds to $a+b$ but the reason is not that obvious to me. Intuitively we use addition when we ""add"" something so if I'm ""adding"" a line segment with length $a$ to another line segment with length $b$ the length of the resulting line must be $a+b$. But with a formal definition of addition (via Dedekind cuts for example) that property of addition doesn't seem that clear to me. I guess my question is: why must addition correspond to $a•b$? Why, if I have a line segment of length 3/2 and other one of length 5/3 can I be sure that if I arrange them so that one starts exactly when the other one ends, the length of the resulting line will be 19/6?

2336455,Hahn Banach Theorem: Transfinite Induction,"In the 4th book of Stein and Shakarchi, the statement of the Hahn-Banach theorem is as follows: Suppose $V_0$ is a linear subspace of $V$ and $p$ is a real sub-linear function on $V$, and that we are given a linear functional $l_0$ on $V_0$ that satisfies $$l_0(v)\leq p(v) ~\forall ~v\in V_0$$
  Then $l_0$ can be extended to a linear functional $l$ on $V$ that satisfies 
  $$l(v) \leq p(v)~ \forall ~ v \in V$$ The proof given is as follows: We have already proved that if $l_0$ can be extended to a subspace W, then it can also be extended to the subspace $W+ w$ for any vector $w$. We well order all the vectors in $V$ that do not belong to $V_0$, and denote this ordering by $<$. Among these vectors, we call a vector $v$ extendable if the linear functional $l_0$ has an extension of the kind desired to the subspace spanned by $V_0.v$ and all the vectors $<v$. What we want to prove is in effect that all vectors not in $V_0$ are extendable. Assume the contrary, then because of the well-ordering we can find the smallest $v_1$ that is not extendable. Now if $V_0'$ is the space spanned by $V_0$ and all the vectors $<v_1$,then by assumption $l_0$ extends to $V_0'$. The previous step, with $V_0'$ in place of $V_0$ allows us then to extend $l_0$ to the subspace spanned by $V_0'$ and $v_1$, reaching a contradiction. This proves the theorem. Firstly, how does proving that all vectors not in $V_0$ are extendable imply that an extension exists for the whole space? We know that for any $v \notin V_0$ there exists a valid extension, say $l_v$ for the space spanned by $V_0,v$ and all vectors $<v$. Say we define $l(v):=l_v(v)$. Now we take an arbitrary $w>v$. Couldn't it happen that $l_w(v) \ne l_v(v)$. In this case how can one define $l$? Will it help if we change the definition of ""extendable"" to something like: A vector $v \notin V_0$ is called extendable if $l_0$ has an extension of the kind desired to the relevant subspace which is equal to the already defined functionals $l_w~ \forall w<v$ in the relevant subspaces?

I'm having some trouble to show that $\mathbb{P}(A_x) > 0$","['probability-theory', 'probability']"
