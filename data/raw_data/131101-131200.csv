2045683,Integer solutions question simple,"Suppose I have:
$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 12$$ and I want to find all solutions $x_i \geq 1$ Well firstly I can give 1 to each x, so that leaves me with:
$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 8$$
Then, I can just make 3 dividers, like such:
$$x_1 | x_2 | x_3 | x_4$$
and so my answer is $$\binom{8+3}{3} = \binom{11}{3}$$
My sheet says: $\textit{Theorem}$: The number of ways to distribute $r$ identical objects into $n$ distinct boxes with at least $one$ object in each box is:
$$\binom{r-1}{n-1}$$

2045692,What is the idea to show this property of a function based on its Fourier transform?,"Let $f\in \mathcal{M}(\mathbb{R})$ be a function of moderate decrease such that the Fourier transform $\mathfrak{F}(f)$ is continuous and satisfies: $$\mathfrak{F}(f)(\xi) = O\left(\dfrac{1}{|\xi|^{1+\alpha}}\right), \quad \text{as $|\xi|\to\infty$}$$ where $\alpha \in (0,1)$. I want to show that $f$ satisfies the Hölder condition of order $\alpha$: $$|f(x+h)-f(x)|\leq M|h|^\alpha, \quad \text{with $M> 0$ and for all $x,h\in \mathbb{R}$}.$$ Now the condition on $\mathfrak{F}(f)$ says that it is continuous and furthermore, there's $K\in \mathbb{R}$ such that if $|\xi|> K$ we have $$\mathfrak{F}(f)(\xi)\leq \dfrac{A}{|\xi|^{1+\alpha}}, \quad \text{for all $|\xi|> K$ and for some $A\in \mathbb{R}$}.$$ Now, I really have no idea on what to do here. The obvious initial step is to write: $$|f(x+h)-f(x)| = \left|\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathfrak{F}(f)(\xi)e^{2\pi i (x+h)\xi}d\xi-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathfrak{F}(f)(\xi)e^{2\pi i x\xi}d\xi\right|$$ So that we have $$|f(x+h)-f(x)| \leq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\mathfrak{F}(f)(\xi)| | e^{2\pi i h\xi}-1|d\xi.$$ Now one suggestion is to break this integral as follows: $$|f(x+h)-f(x)|\leq \int_{|\xi|\leq 1/|h|} |\mathfrak{F}(f)(\xi)||e^{2\pi ih\xi -1}|d\xi + \int_{|\xi|\geq 1/|h|} |\mathfrak{F}(f)(\xi)||e^{2\pi ih\xi -1}|d\xi. $$ And now I'm completely stuck. First of all, I really have no idea or intuition whatsoever on what has to be done . My only guess would be to use continuity on the compact $[-1/|h|,1/|h|]$ to bound $\mathfrak{F}(f)$ there, but this would not produce the desired $|h|^\alpha$. On the other integral I can't also use the other condition over $\mathfrak{F}(f)$ because the integral is for $|\xi| \geq 1/|h|$ not $|\xi| > K$. Anyway, I'm quite lost here. So how can I show this? But much more importantly than how to prove this , how can I actually arrive at the proof? How can I have the idea on what has to be done? What is the right way to think about this problem, in order to solve it? I'm much more interested here in how should I reason about this, and how can I have the idea of how to prove it.","['real-analysis', 'fourier-analysis', 'problem-solving', 'functional-analysis', 'integration']"

2045722,Why is the upper Riemann integral the infimum of all upper sums?,"I was reading the theory of Riemann integration when I cam across the following , If $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$ , and $P = \{x_0,x_1,x_2.......x_n\}$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ , let $$M_j = \sup_{x_{j-1}\leq x\leq x_j}f(x)$$ The upper sum of f over P is $$S(P) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} M_j(x_j-x_{j-1})$$ and the upper integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$ , denoted by $$\int_{a}^{b^-} f(x)dx$$ is the infimum of all upper sums. The theorem similarly goes on to state the result for lower sums. My doubt is : I do not understand how is $$\int_{a}^{b^-} f(x)dx$$ the infimum of all upper sums. I understand that if we refine the partition P, then the upper sum would decrease, so it may be a lower limit for all the upper sums computed on the refinements of P (but still being the lower limit does not prove that it is the infimum) and what about those partitions for which P itself is the refinement of? 
How do I know that it will be a lower limit for those, let alone a infimum?","['real-analysis', 'riemann-integration']"
2045724,Proving limit using precise limit definition,"I would like to prove that $$
\lim_{x \rightarrow 2}\frac{1}{x^2}=\frac{1}{4}
$$ using the epsilon-delta definition of a limit. I start with the formal definition: For every $\varepsilon$ > 0 there exist a $\delta$ > 0 such that if $|x - a| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - a|$ < $\varepsilon$. So I need to prove that if $|x - 2| < \delta$ then $|\frac{1}{x^2} - \frac{1}{4}| < \varepsilon$ . I start by doing scratch-work to turn the left hand side of $|\frac{1}{x^2} - \frac{1}{4}| < \varepsilon$ into $|x-2|$

I would be able to complete the proof if the right-hand side were simply $\frac{\varepsilon}{|x+2|}$, but the $4x^2$ is throwing me off. Normally I would pick: $\delta \leq 1$ then use $|x-2|<\delta=1$, or $-1<x-2<1$ to turn $x-2$ into the denominator with $\varepsilon$, then pick the lowest bound of the inequality, giving me $\delta = min:\{1, \frac{\varepsilon}{<lowest bound>}\}$ I don't know how to handle the extra $4x^2$ however.

2045783,Prove that if $n \mid 1 + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^{n-1}$ then $n$ is prime.,"How can I show that if $$n \mid 1 + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^{n-1}$$ then $n$ is prime? I was able to prove that $n$ must be squarefree as follows: since $n \mid 1 + \sum_\limits{k=0}^{n-1} k^{n-1}$ then $\sum_\limits{k=0}^{n-1} k^{n-1} \equiv -1 \pmod n.$ Suppose some prime $p \mid n$, and let $q = n/p$. Now $\sum_\limits{k=0}^{n-1} k^{n-1} \equiv -1 \pmod p$, so
$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}k^{n-1} = \sum_{m=0}^{q-1}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}(mp+k)^{n-1} \equiv \sum_{m=0}^{q-1}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}k^{n-1} = q\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}k^{n-1} \equiv -1 \pmod p.$$
Since $-1$ is a unit in $\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$, then so must be $q$, so since $p$ is prime we have $p \nmid q$, and thus $p \mid n$ but $p^2 \nmid n$. I have not been able to show that $n$ must be prime. By reducing exponents using Fermat's Little Theorem, I can show that for every prime $p \mid n$ (again $q = n/p$) we have
$$q \sum_{k=0}^{p-1} k^{q-1} \equiv -1 \pmod p$$

This method allowed me to solve a simple equation like the Airy equation. But if I try to do that in this case, the moment I divide the boxed equation on both sides by $x^2$, you get a $\frac{1}{x}$ as the co-efficient for the first-derivative term, which doesn't represent the form of my differential equation's 2nd term (which has $\frac{1}{\tau + t}$ as its coefficient). I am wondering if I am missing something here, or perhaps there's an intermediary step that's required before I can use this method.

Does $C$ contain only univariate polynomials, i.e. $C = \mathbb Z[x]$? My intuition is that this must be the case. Since $f$ is well-defined $\mod p$ for every prime $p$, then I feel that $f$ must be defined based only on ring operations generically, so that the same definition of $f$ (with ring operations) works for any ring $\mathbb Z / p\mathbb Z$.

2046470,Details in applying the Barr-Beck monadicity theorem to Tannakian reconstruction,"The Barr-Beck monadicity theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a category $\mathcal{C}$ to be equivalent to a category of (co)algebras over a (co)monad. A functor $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$  is said to be comonadic if it has a right adjoint $G$ and the ""enhanced functor"" $F': \mathcal{C}\to\mathsf{Coalg}_{FG} (\mathcal{D})$ into colagebras over the comonad $FG$ on $\mathcal{D}$ is an equivalence. The comonadic version of Barr-Beck says: A functor $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ is comonadic if and only if: F has a right adjoint; F reflects isomorphisms; Every $F$-cosplit pair in $\mathcal{C}$ admits an equaliser in $\mathcal{C}$ and it is preserved by $F$. I have recently learned that this substantially simplifies the proof of Tannaka duality for a (neutral) Tannakian category $\mathcal{C}$ with fiber functor $\omega:\mathcal{C}\to\mathsf{Vecf}_k$ to be equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional representations of an affine group scheme $G$. Namely, the Barr-Beck theorem applied to $\omega$ establishes that $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to the category of comodules over a coalgebra $A$. Then the rigid tensor structure on $\mathcal{C}$ can be used to show that $A$ is a commutative Hopf algebra and hence is the coordinate ring of an affine group scheme. I would like some tips towards the Barr-Beck part of this proof. Firstly, note that by definition $\omega$ is exact and faithful, so conditions (2) and (3) in Barr-Beck are satisfied. I am not sure how to easily show condition (1), that $\omega$ has a right adjoint $R$ (adjoint functor theorems seem too general, but maybe I have missed something). Can anyone help with this? Secondly, assume that Barr-Beck applies and that $\omega'$ induces an equivalence $\mathcal{C}\simeq\mathsf{Coalg}_{C} (\mathsf{Vecf}_k)$, where $C = \omega\circ R$ is the comonad induced on $\mathsf{Vecf}_k$ by the adjunction $\omega\dashv R$. Then $A=C(k)$ is a $k$-coalgebra, and I believe that $\mathsf{Coalg}_C (\mathsf{Vecf}_k)$ is equivalent to the category $\mathsf{Comodf}_A$ of finitely-generated comodules over the coalgebra $A$. However, I am not sure how to do this because I don't know whether $k$ can be made into a $C$-coalgebra $a_k: k\to C(k)$. If it can, I would want to define the $A$-comodule structure on a $C$-coalgebra $V$ as $$V\xrightarrow{\sim} k\otimes V\xrightarrow{a_k\otimes \text{id}} A\otimes V,$$ but I don't know if this is correct.

Show that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$ . Well, since $f(a) = 0$ , we have that $|f'(a)| \leq C|0|$ , so $|f'(a)| = 0$ . Since $f$ has a continuous derivative, we also know that $f$ is continuous. Since $f$ is continuous on a compact interval, $f$ obtains a maximum, say at $\xi \in [a,b]$ . So, $|f'(x)| \leq C|f(\xi)|$ . Since the derivative is bounded, we obtain that $f$ is Lipschitz, so $f$ is also uniformly continuous. Suppose to the contrary that $f(\xi) > 0$ ?

In the $p = \frac{1}{2}$ case, the first derivative is zero, hence we use the second order delta method: Suppose that $\sqrt{n}(T_n-\theta_0) \to_D Z$ and that we are interested in $g(T_n)$ where $g'(\theta_0) = 0$ but $g''$ is continuous and nonzero in a neighborhood of $\theta_0$.

$\sqrt{n}(g(T_n)-g(\theta_0)) \to_D \frac{g''(\theta_0)}{2}Z^2

2048078,Why keeping a disctinction between almost surely equal elements in probability theory?,"[[This is a rephrasing of this question , intended to be more general.]] One of the fundamental rules of the mathematical language is that one is allowed to give a name only to a unique object. Now, in probability theory, we can consider examples like conditional expectation and conditional probabilities (wrt to a $\sigma$-algebra) that are defined as any random variable that respect some given statements but that are given names $E(X|\mathcal{F})$ and $P(B|\mathcal{F})$. Another example is the Radon–Nikodym $\frac{d\mu}{d\nu}$ (although this is more generally a concept of measure theory) and more generally probability theory generates a lot of objects that are almost surely unique . Similarly, many statements are ""only"" almost surely true and it seems to me that the Borel Kolmogorov paradox implies that what happens in a null set can only be consider meaningfull / interesting if one specifies how to reach this null set (so if one specifies sequences / nets / filters of non null sets that in some sense ""converge"" to it). When mathematicians have multiple objects satisfying a given property but do not want to care about this variability, they generally resort to a powerful and amazing concept : quotient set and equivalent classes. This is to my knowledge the canonical tool used every time one wants to forget irrelevant variability. This can also bring unexpected structures out. $L^p$ are only Banach spaces (and $L^2$ is only a Hilbert space) because one does want to make a difference between almost everywhere equal functions. A $S$-valued random element is traditionally described as a measurable function  $X : (\Omega, \sigma_\Omega, P) \mapsto (S, \sigma_S)$. Here I consider with $S$ all type of spaces, including functional spaces. So the definition here is intended to encompasses all types of random variables, stochastic processes, random fields, point processes, random measures, random set, etc. In the end, why hasn't any attempt to simplify the entire theory of probability by considering equivalent classes wherever possible (which seems everywhere) and then defining any kind of $S$-valued random element as an equivalent class of almost surely equal random function on $S$? What could be a fundamental obstacle (mathematically speaking, I'm not considering social traditions) to such an approach, or what relevant information might be lost with it ? It seems to me that most of the current phrasing of probability theory (and I don't even mention statistics) is laborious.

2048114,The lebesgue integral equals the Riemann integral,"Suppose that $f$ is integrable on $[a, \infty)$ for some $a \in \mathbb{R}$.

$$ \int_{[a, \infty)} f ~ d\lambda = \int_a^{\infty} f(x) ~ dx $$
My attempt: we know that there is an increasing sequence $(u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of step functions that converges uniformly to $f$ (from below) and
$$ \int_{[a, \infty)} f ~ d\lambda = \sup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \int_{[a, \infty)} u_n ~ d \lambda $$
However, since $u_n$ is a step function on $[a, \infty)$, it assumes only finite different values on $[a, \infty)$, say the values $r_{n, 1}, \ldots, r_{n, k_n}$. Writing $A_{n, i} = u^{-1}(r_{n, i})$, the disjointness of the $A_{n, i}$ yields
$$ \int_{[a, \infty)} f ~ d\lambda = \sup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \sum_{i = 1}^{k_n} \int_{A_{n, i}} u_n ~ d\lambda = \sup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \sum_{i = 1}^{k_n} r_{n, i} \cdot \mu(A_{n, i}) $$
But now, I am stuck. What I see is that the right hand side is basically just the interval $[a, \infty)$ split into a finite ($k_n$) amount of pieces and then some lower sum of the integral is computed. Intuitively, this lower sum converges to the integral, but I am unable to prove this. I have also read something about the Lebesgue and Riemann integral of step functions are identical. However, this would only give me

For this reason, with any solutions, could you possibly include the 'steps'/'clues' that led you to the solution, and how similar questions could be approached. Thanks... Edit: Initially I was a bit wary of using anything involving Taylor polynomials as it is not something that has been remotely touched on in lectures (only the 'obvious' properties of functions such as log have been used/manipulated in inequalities), but now that I think about it, log is (usually) just defined in terms of its series expansion (correct me if I'm wrong here... I know it is also sometimes defined in terms of an integral). Hence, I feel that answers involving Taylor polynomial are good too... nevertheless, given the fact that none of this has been used in any of the other questions or examples from lectures, I am still wondering if there is another way of proving convergence just using inequality manipulation and only 'basic' logarithm inequalities. ...

I'm guessing the correspondence between the precise and the heuristic is as follows: Heuristic: $\text{If I expect to expect} \ \color{green}{\text{something}} \ \text{at} \ \color{red}{\text{some date in the future}},$ $\text{then I already expect that} \ \color{green}{\text{something}} \ \text{at} \ \color{purple}{\text{present}}.$ Precise in the case of one non-trivial $\sigma-$ algebra, $$E[E[\color{green}{X}|\color{red}{\mathscr F_t}]] = E[\color{green}{X}|\color{purple}{\mathscr F_0}] (= E[\color{green}{X}])$$ Or Precise in the case of two non-trivial $\sigma-$ algebras, $$E[E[\color{green}{X}|\color{red}{\mathscr F_{t+1}}]|\color{purple}{\mathscr F_t}] = E[\color{green}{X}|\color{purple}{\mathscr F_t}]$$ where $\color{green}{X}$ is a random variable in $(\Omega, \mathscr F, \mathbb P)$ with filtration $\{\mathscr F_t\}_{t\in I}$ where $I \subseteq \mathbb R$ An example I thought of for second case I currently expect to expect tomorrow at 1pm that someone will try to prank me tomorrow at 3pm if and only if I currently expect someone to prank me tomorrow at 3pm Where 3pm refers to the larger $\mathscr F_{.}$ and 1pm refers to the smaller $\mathscr F_{.}$ . 1.

$$
\phi\otimes \psi(x,y) = \langle x,\phi \rangle_1 \langle y,\psi \rangle_2

We note that since only $H_1$ has a complex inner product, we can in general for $\lambda\in \mathbb{C}$ only say that
$$
\lambda (\phi \otimes \psi) = (\lambda \psi)\otimes \psi \quad \quad \text{and not}\quad \quad  \lambda (\phi \otimes \psi) =  \psi\otimes (\lambda\psi).
$$
Anyways I have proven (I can add the proof, but i think it is correct) that we can create an inner product of the space $\mathcal{E}$ of all finite linear combinations of the bilinear mappings considered above, by letting 
$$
\langle \phi_1 \otimes \psi_1 , \phi_2\otimes \psi_2 \rangle = \langle\phi_1,\phi_2 \rangle_1 \langle\psi_1,\psi_2 \rangle_2

$$
We now define $H_1\otimes H_2$ as the completion of the space of finite linear combinations with respect to the metric induced by the above inner product. Furhtermore it is well-known that the above inner product can be extended to $H_1\otimes H_2$, such that it satisfies

2048396,Relationship between Cauchy-Goursat Theorem and conservative vector fields,"In vector calculus we know that if $\,\,\underline{F}\,\,$ is a $\,\,\underline{conservative}\,\,$ vector field, then: $\oint_\gamma{\textbf{F}\cdot d{\textbf{r}}} = 0$, where $\gamma$ is a closed curve. $\nabla\times \textbf{F} = 0$, i.e. the Curl Vanishes $\oint_{\gamma_1}{\textbf{F}\cdot d{\textbf{r}}}= \oint_{\gamma_2}{\textbf{F}\cdot d{\textbf{r}}}$, where $\gamma_i$ starts at $A$ and ends at $B$, Path Independent $\textbf{F} = \nabla\phi$, Existence of Potential, $\phi$ is a scalar field. However in Complex Analysis we know that if $f$ is holomorphic along and inside a simple closed contour $C$, then: $$\int_Cf(z)dz = 0$$ where $z\in\mathbb{C}$. I wanted to know what is the relationship between these two properties in $\mathbb{R}$ and in $\mathbb{C}$. Indeed in both we have a closed path that does not intersect itself (simple). However, in $\mathbb{R}$ we require that the vector field is conservative, whereas in $\mathbb{C}$ we require that the function is holomorphic inside and into the contour. My idea was that the property of the conservative vector field that the curl vanishes, somehow connects to $f$ being holomorphic. Indeed by the sufficiency theorem we know that $f$ is holomorphic if the four partial derivatives $u_x,u_y,v_x,v_y$ exists and are continuous on and in the contour, furthermore the Cauchy Riemann equations hold, i.e. $u_x = v_y$ and $v_x = -u_y$. The Cauchy-Riemann equations look like they could come out of the cross product between $\nabla$ and $\mathbf{F}$ somehow. Even though I couldn't figure it out. I tried to make some kind of function that transforms $f: \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ to a function $g:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$, where $u(x,y)\to x'$ and $v(x,y) \to y'$, where $g(x',y') = (u(x,y),v(x,y))$. However I have no idea if what I am doing even makes sense. So I would like to know if you could explain to me how the conditions of a conservative vector field translate to those in $\mathbb{C}$ and vice versa. Indeed in both cases we have that the integral around the path is zero, so there could be some relationship. Please let me know how you would go about showing the link between these two apparently separate properties.","['complex-analysis', 'vector-fields', 'vector-analysis']"
2048410,"In expectation, does conditioning reduce moments beyond the second?","I know that conditioning on a random variable, in expectation, reduces variance. This is a consequence of the law of total variance. Formally, I refer to the following:
$$E[Var(x|y)]=Var(x)-Var[E(x|y)]\le Var(x)$$
where equivalence holds only in the case of independence. 
My question is whether this type of argumentation extends to higher moments. In particular, is it the case that: $$E[(x-E(x|y))^k]\le E[(x-E(x))^k]$$
for $k>2$ and arbitrary distributions of $x$ and $y$? Intuitively, I believe it must hold for $k$ even, but haven't thought of a suitable proof technique. I'm not sure whether or not it will hold for $k$ odd.","['statistics', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"
2048416,Which would you rather have?,"Q.  Which would you rather have, a piece of an 8-inch pie that's been cut into sixths or a piece of a 10-inch pie that's been cut into eights? A.  This is a problem involving sectors. One-sixth of a pie is $\frac {1}{6}$ of $ 2\pi$ radians. The measure of the central angle is $\frac{1}{6} \cdot 2\pi = \frac{\pi}{3}$. An 8-inch pie has a 4-inch radius. Putting the angle and radius into the formula, for the area of a sector, $A= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{3} \cdot 4^2 = \frac{16\pi}{6} = \frac{8\pi}{3} \approx 8.38$ square inches. One-eighth of a pie is $\frac{1}{8}$ of $2\pi$ radians. The measure of the angle is $\frac{1}{8} \cdot 2\pi = \frac{2\pi}{8} = \frac{\pi}{4}$. A 10-inch pie has a 5-inch radius. Putting the angle and radius into the formula, for the area of a sector, $A= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot 5^2 = \frac{25\pi}{8} \approx 9.82$ square inches. There isn't too much difference, but it looks like the smaller part of the bigger pie has the larger piece, in terms of area. My question: Is how do one, get, $2\pi$ radians?",['trigonometry']
2048469,How to prove that a function is affine?,"I am trying to understand the concept of affinity of functions. First, I thought that every affine function has to be a linear function, too, because my teacher's notes define linear and affine functions as follows: $$ T(\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_iu_i) = \sum_{i=0}^n\alpha_iT(u_i) $$
is a linear function. An affine function is defined as $ T(\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_iu_i) $ with $ \sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i = 1 $ and the above condition of a linear function. Then, I found the example of $ f(x) = 2x + 3 $ which is an affine function but not linear which is pretty confusing to me (I understand why it is not linear, but have no clue as to why it is affine according to the definitions). I also have to solve a problem such as:
$$ T: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R},  T(x,y,z) := (x − z + 1, y - 5, z - y, 2) $$
but I really have no idea how to proof if it's affine or not. There are no $ \alpha $ and that function is not linear, so I am kind of stuck here. I appreciate any sort of help, like links to websites or anything that helps me to understand this because I have no strategy to solve this problem.","['linear-algebra', 'vectors', 'vector-spaces']"
2048490,Anyone knows a transformation that can lump non-zero values in a matrix together?,"Suppose you have a matrix that contains a lot of zeros (like spare matrix). Is there any known transformation that can gather non-zero values (e.g., into a corner of the matrix)? I am not sure but I think such a transformation is very likely to be non-linear. There is a naïve transformation can be used as an example of the intention (however it does not well achieve the above objective). You can count the number of zeros of each row and rearrange rows by those counts in an ascending order. This can be done by multiplying a corresponding permutation matrix on the left. Then you can count the number of zeros of each column and do the same thing -- rearrange the columns by those counts in an ascending order. After rearrangement of both rows and columns, a sparse matrix would approximate a diagonal block matrix, as shown below, with blue color meaning 0. However, I am asking if there is any transformation that can lump most non-zero values into approximately one block , rather than a diagonal block. It would be greatly appreciated if someone could help provide some hint or reference.","['numerical-linear-algebra', 'matrices', 'sparse-matrices', 'numerical-methods', 'linear-algebra']"
2048539,Using the commutator to show unit vectors in polar coordinates are a noncoordinate basis?,"I'm having trouble getting the algebra right here and don't know where I'm going wrong: Show that the unit basis vector fields for polar coordinates in the Euclidean plane, $$\hat{\mathbf{r}} = \cos\theta \hat{\mathbf{x}} + \sin\theta \hat{\mathbf{y}} \\
\hat{\mathbf{\theta}} = -\sin\theta \hat{\mathbf{x}} + \cos\theta \hat{\mathbf{y}}

I started by noting that $x=r\cos\theta$, $y=r\sin\theta$, therefore $\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\cos\theta = \dfrac{1}{r}$ and $\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\sin\theta= \dfrac{1}{r}$. Then I wrote out the commutator components: $$ [\hat{\mathbf{r}}, \hat{\mathbf{\theta}}] = \left[r^i {\partial\over\partial x^i}, \theta^j {\partial\over\partial x^j}\right] \\
 = \left(r^i {\partial\theta^j\over\partial x^i}- \theta^i {\partial r^j\over\partial x^i}\right){\partial\over\partial x^j} \\

2048590,How do we know what the integral of $\sin (x)$ is?,"Since I started more or less formally learning the foundations of calculus, I naturally came across the Riemann definition of the integral. At first I considered this definition intuitive but not really useful since to obtain a closed form expression, one needed to add an infinite amount of values. Later on, an exercise prompted me to calculate a Riemann Integral, and from the definition and the expression for the sum of squares, I was able to calculate the limit with nothing more than I had learned at school. This was a revelation for me, since so far I had considered the definition a mere formalism. Now I knew how it gave results. The next integral I tried to calculate this way was, for obvious reasons $\sqrt {1-x^2}$. Unfortunately, I found the sum intractable and gave up. I started to question the usefulness of the definition again. If it only works for simple functions like polynomials, how did we ever find out that the integral of $\sin (x)$ is $-\cos (x)$? Did we use the Riemann definition or did we just say ""the derivative of $-\cos (x)$ is $\sin (x)$ and therefore its integral must be $-\cos (x)$? I would like to get some insight into the theory as well as the history that led to the tables of integrals we have today","['math-history', 'calculus']"
