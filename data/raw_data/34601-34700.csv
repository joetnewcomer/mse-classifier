329970,Trigonometry / Geometry Puzzle with a Circle Inscribed within a Square,Point $P$ is any point on the inscribed circle. You must prove that $$(\tan(a))^2 + (\tan(B))^2 = 8$$ I first moved point $P$ down to the point where the square would be tangent to the curve to make the problem easier. I realized that $(\tan(a))^2 = (\tan(b))^2 = 4$ in this simplified case. Next I separated $(\tan(a))^2$ into $$\frac{\sin(a)}{\cos(a)} \frac{\sin(a)}{\cos(a)} =4$$ and from there $$\frac{\sin(a)}{\cos(a)} =2$$ Then I used the law of sine to find that $$\frac{\sin(a)}{2^{1/2}\cdot AB} = \frac{\sin(A)}{1/2AB}$$ And that $\sin(a) = 2\cdot 2^{1/2}\cdot \sin(A)$ After that I was kind of lost on what to do. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you in advance!,"['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'contest-math']"

329983,"$ a $ and $b$ are real numbers with $0 < b < a$. Prove that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $a^n - b^n \leq na^{n-1}(a - b)$.","I'm taking a basic discrete math course and I'm having a hard time with Mathematical Induction. The problem is stated as: Suppose that $ a $ and $b$ are real numbers with $0 < b < a$. Prove that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $a^n - b^n \leq na^{n-1}(a - b)$. The work I have so far is: Basis Step:
$$\begin{aligned} 
P(1) \equiv a^1 - b^1 &\leq (1)a^{(0)}(a - b) \\\
a - b &\leq (1)(1)(a - b) \\\

Assume that $P(k)$ is true for any fixed integer $k \geq 0$. Induction Hypothesis : $$ P(k) \equiv a^k-b^k \leq ka^{k-1}(a-b)$$
Prove that $ P(k+1) $ is true given $P(k)$:
$$\begin{aligned}
P(k+1) &\equiv& a^{k+1} - b^{k+1} &\leq (k+1)a^k(a-b)\\\

330040,I thought I proved the Limit here didn't exist....,"So, this seems like it should be fairly simple, right?
$$ F(x,y) = {xy\over \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} $$ If one takes $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)}F(x,y)$ along the line $y=x$, the limit simplifies to $ \lim_ {x \to 0}\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{x^2+x^2}} $ which quickly reduces to $|x|/\sqrt{2}$, ie 0. If one takes $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)}F(x,y)$ along the parabola $y=x^2$, the equation simplifies to $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x^3}{\sqrt{x^2+x^4}}$ which evaluates to $ 0 $ not as I thought $ \infty $ by multiplication by $\frac{1 \over \sqrt{x^6}}{1 \over \sqrt{x^6}}$. Therefore the limit could (as opposed to not, as I originally thought) exist.  Alas, according to the book, this is incorrect - the limit is 0 ( of course ).

330055,"Irreducible subgroups of $\text{GL}(2,p)$","I just wonder any sources that provides the list of all minimal irreducible subgroups of $\text{GL}(2,p)$. Here the term ""minimal"" means there is no proper subgroup that is irreducible. A list of maximal subgroups of $\text{PSL}(2,p)$ is available here . For some case, it is easy to know the subgroup is reducible, but generally I am not sure how to dig information from here. I think it would be good if there is some reference which provides full list of all irreducible subgroups. I think first we need to know all the maximal subgroups of $\text{GL}(2,q)$. Since $\text{GL}(2,q)'=\text{SL}(2,q)$, so a maximal subgroup $M$ of $\text{GL}(2,q)$ contains $Z$ or $\text{SL}(2,q)$. If $M>Z$, then we look at the subgroups of $\text{PGL}(2,q)$; if $M>\text{SL}(2,q)$, then we look at the subgroups of $\text{PSL}(2,q)$. Then the next thing is that if you know a group is irreducible, how do you analyse the irreducibility of its subgroups? Since sometimes it seems not clear to me that how the subgroup acts on the vectors space. And I am also not too sure how to find the critical subgroups, that is the minimal one.

For example, the set $\{10,4,5\}$ is fat, $\{1,562,13,2\}$ is not. Define $f(n)$ to count the number of fat sets of a set of integers $\{1...n\}$ where we count the empty set as a fat set. eg: $f(4) = 8$ because $\{Ø, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{4\}, \{2,3\}, \{2,4\}, \{3,4\}\}$ Show that $f(n) = F_{n+2}$ where $F_n$ is the nth fibonacci number. (So for $n=4, f(4)=F_6=8$). I was given a hint to first construct a recursive equation of $f(n)$ then use the initial condition to infer that the recursive equation has to be a fibonacci recurrence thus arriving at our goal. My main guess at the recursive equation was $f(n) = f(n-1)+f(n-2)$. As to how I arrived at this, I kind of cheated by assuming the identity to be true then split $F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_{n}$ and applied the identity. I want to show that this recurrence is true (which I guess is done by induction in some form or even better, a combinatorics argument as the structure looks rather familiar) then the rest I'm sure will follow given initial conditions.

330147,Some questions about functions of bounded variation: Jordan's theorem,"I was trying to do some of these questions to check my understanding about the topic, but I'm not sure if they're correct. Here are my answers. 1) Suppose $f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$. Must there be a nondegenerate closed subinterval $[a,b]$ of $[0,1]$ for which the restriction of $f$ to $[a,b]$ is of bounded variation? No, because $f(x)$ might be a constant function. In this case, $f(x)$ will not be the difference of two increasing functions...and so will not be of bounded variation. 2) Let $f$ be the Dirichlet function, the characteristic function of the rationals in $[0,1]$. Is $f$ of bounded variation on $[0,1]$? No, because we cannot express it as the difference of two increasing functions. 3) Let $f$ be a step function on $[a,b]$. Find a formula for its total variation. If we partition $[a,b]$ in such a way that for each $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ (which is part of the partition), $x_{i-1}$ and $x_i$ each correspond to the midpoint of a step.

330314,Counting Balanced Brackets with a twist,"I have $n$ ""1""s written as a sum: $1+1+1+\dots+1$, and proceed to add some brackets to the sum. Call the modified sum ""good"" if the brackets are balanced and not redundant*. [Since in fact placing any brackets is redundant, redundancy here is limited to brackets around a single ""1"", that is $(1)$ and more than one pair of brackets around the same sum, such as $((1+1))$.] For example, if $ n = 4 $, then $$(1+1)+(1+1)$$
$$(1+1+1)+1$$
$$(1+(1+1)+1)$$ are all good. The full list (as far as I can see) of good sums for $n=4$ is 1+1+1+1, 1+1+(1+1), 1+(1+1+1), 1+(1+(1+1)), 1+((1+1)+1), (1+1+1)+1, (1+(1+1))+1, ((1+1)+1)+1, (1+1)+1+1, (1+1)+(1+1), and all those sums with an outermost pair of brackets added. Edit : I missed out one of the good sums, namely 1+(1+1)+1 . How many good sums are there for each $n$? My attempt at a solution is as follows. First, let a ""spanning bracket pair"" be a pair of open and close brackets that include the entire sum; for example $(1+1+1+1)$ contains a spanning bracket pair. Let $a_n$ and $b_n$ be respectively the number of sums for each $n$ with and without a spanning bracket pair respectively, and $c_n=a_n+b_n$. For convenience, we define $a_0=0, b_0=0$ For $n=1$, $a_1=0, b_1=1$, and for $n\geq 2$, $a_n=b_n$. Edit : My initial recurrence relation was far more complicated than it had to be. The edited recurrence relation is as follows. To set up a recurrence relation for $b_n$, we note that all good sums without a spanning bracket pair of length $n$ can be classified into exactly two types: those with an initial open bracket $($, and those without. To count the number with an initial open bracket $($, we split each of the sums into two good sub-sums such that the first sum has a spanning bracket pair. For example, the sum (1+1)+1+(1+1) would be split into (1+1) and 1+(1+1) . The number of sums with an initial open bracket is then just $$a_2c_{n-2}+a_3c_{n-3}+a_4c{n_4}+\dots+a_{n-1}c_1=\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} a_ic_{n-i}$$ To count the number without an initial open bracket, we note that by removing the leading $1+$ term, we are simply left with a good sum of length $n-1$ (that may or may not have a spanning bracket pair). Thus, the number of such terms is simply $$c_{n-1}$$ Thus, the required relation is just $$b_n=c_{n-1}+\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} a_ic_{n-i}=\sum_{1=2}^{n-1} b_ic_{n-i}$$ Since $a_n=b_n$ for $n=2$, while $b_1=1$. Calculating a few initial terms, I found that the values of $c_n$ were $1, 2, 6, 22, 90, 394, 1806, \dots$ and plugging this into OEIS as suggested, I found that this was just A006318 , the large Schroeder numbers. At the moment, though, I'm still trying to figure out how to produce the generating function for the large Schroeder numbers from this recurrence. For your reference, $$f(x)=\frac{1-x-\sqrt{1-6x+x^2}}{2x}$$ is the generating function.","['catalan-numbers', 'generating-functions', 'combinatorics']"

However, how can I conclude this? Is $(2mk + k + m)$ in fact an integer? How do I know if the product of any two integers is an integer; similarly, does adding any two integers yield another integer?

Given a set $A$ we wish to construct a vector space $F(A)$ which intuitively is the vector space whose elements are linear combination of $A$ (in other words, we think of $F(A)$ as the vector space that has $A$ as it's base). Well, the problem here is that $A$ is just a set, without additional operations defined on it's elements. So what we do is to consider indicator functions $\delta_a : A \to \left\{0,1\right\}$ such that $\delta_a(x) = 1$ if $x = a$ and $\delta_a(x) = 0$ if not. Then we consider the set $F(A)$ of all functions with finite support on $A$. Well, this seems very natural: the indicator functions themselves are in $F(A)$ since they have finite support. In this case, $\delta_a\in F(A)$ is the ""representative"" of $a \in A$ at $F(A)$. Now, for those functions we can define their sum and multiplication by scalar in the natural pointwise fashion. Now, each $\delta_a$ represents some element of $A$ and the linear combinations of those functions represents the linear combinations of the elements of $A$ that we wanted to define. Since all functions with finite support can be expressed as linear combination of those indicator functions, and since they are linearly independent, we can say that they indeed form a base for the space. And then we can check that the set $F(A)$ with the operations defined really is a vector space. With all of this, given a set $A$ we've succesfully constructed a vector space $F(A)$ that intuitively has all linear combinations from the elements of $A$. And since $\delta_a$ represents the element $a \in A$ we usually forget the delta, and just write $a \in F(A)$. Is all of this correct ? My understanding of the construction is indeed correct ?

330766,Showing an analytic map has closed irreducible image,"Let $X,Y$ be complex algebraic varieties with $X$ (algebraically hence also analytically irreducible), $\pi : Y \to X$ an algebraic map with each fiber a finite set, and $g:X \to Y$ an analytic map such that $\pi \circ g=id$.
Then $g(X)$ is a closed analytically irreducible subvariety of the same dimension as $Y$. It seems quite elementary to be honest, but I cannot figure out why it is true. Does anyone have any idea? EDIT: The irreducible part is easy, I am interested in why it is closed and has dimension same as $Y$. EDIT II: OK, I think I figured out the closed too, not in this generality but at least for the purposes that I want it. The dimension somehow seems intuitively clear since each fiber of $\pi$ is a finite set, but I'd still like to see a proof (or at least a hint in the right direction). EDIT III: Damien's answer does not seem to work here because the map $g$ is assumed $analytic$, not algebraic (in fact this lemma is part of trying to show that in that context, $g$ is in fact algebraic, but we don't know it a priori).

330829,"How can I tell if the sequence $a_n=\frac {2^n} {n!}$ converges, and if it converges what is its limit?","I know this question was asked before, but I couldn't find it and I think my question is slightly different. I'm new here so if I do something wrong, I'm sorry, I'm still trying to learn. I need to ""study the limit behavior of the sequence and when it exists compute their limits."" This is what I have tried so far: I studied the first few terms of the sequence, and I claimed that the sequence was monotone and decreasing. Then I showed that $a_{n+1}-a_n\leq0$ by:
$$a_{n+1}-a_n= \frac {2^{n+1}} {(n+1)!}\ - \frac {2^n} {n!}= \frac {2^{n+1}} {n!(n+1)}- \frac {2^n} {n!}=\frac {2^n} {n!}(\frac {2} {n+1})-\frac {2^n} {n!}=\frac {2^n} {n!}(\frac {2} {n+1}-1)=\frac {2^n} {n!}(\frac {n-1} {n+1}) $$
Then I said: $\frac {2^n} {n!}(\frac {n-1} {n+1})\leq 0$ only if $\frac {n-1} {n+1}\leq 0$ because $2^n>0$ and $n!>0$ .
Then I said that $n+1>0$ for n existing the naturals and $1-n\leq0$, thus $\frac {n−1} {n+1}\leq 0$ and $a_{n+1}-a_n\leq 0$. Therefore the sequence is monotonic and decreasing. Because the first term is 2 and $\frac {2^n} {n!}>0$, the sequence is bounded and together the monotonicity and and boundedness means that a limit exists. Now I feel that what I have done so far is correct, and instinctually I know the limit is $0$, but how do I compute that? Do I just claim it is $0$ and prove it using the epsilon definition of a limit?

I have shown that $\mathrm{Inn}(G)$ is non-empty and that it is closed under composition of functions. I am now trying to show that the inverses of inner automorphisms are also inner automorphisms. This is what I have so far in this regard: $f:G \rightarrow G$ is an inner automorphism with $f(x)=c^{-1}xc$ for some fixed $c \in G$. If $a \in G$ then since $f$ is an isomorphism, it is also a bijection and so there is some $x,y \in G$ where $f(x)=a$ and $f(y)=c$. It follows $x=f^{-1}(a)$ and $y=f^{-1}(c).$ Hence
$$f^{-1}(a)=f^{-1}(f(x))=f^{-1}(c^{-1}xc)=\left[ f^{-1}(c)\right]^{-1}f^{-1}(x)f^{-1}(c)=y^{-1}f^{-1}(x)y.$$ At this point I want $f^{-1}(x)=a$ but then $x=f(a)$ which seems suspicious as then $x=c^{-1}ac$ so then $f(x)=f(c^{-1}ac)=(c^{2})^{-1}ac^2=a$ so $(c^{2})^{-1}a=a(c^{2})^{-1}$ but we aren't assuming $G$ is abelian.
