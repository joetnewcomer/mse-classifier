1999693,Why does Friedberg say that the role of the determinant is less central than in former times?,"I am taking a proof-based introductory course to Linear Algebra as an undergrad student of Mathematics and Computer Science. The author of my textbook (Friedberg's Linear Algebra , 4th Edition) says in the introduction to Chapter 4: The determinant, which has played a prominent role in the theory of linear algebra, is a special scalar-valued function defined on the set of square matrices. Although it still has a place in the study of linear algebra and its applications, its role is less central than in former times. He even sets up the chapter in such a way that you can skip going into detail and move on: For the reader who prefers to treat determinants lightly, Section 4.4 contains the essential properties that are needed in later chapters. Could anyone offer a didactic and simple explanation that refutes or asserts the author's statement?","['matrices', 'math-history', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"

1999777,Understanding torsors and semidirect products of groups,"I'm trying to understand the semi-direct product of groups from either a categorical or a geometric perspective and failing miserably. The four things I'm hoping will fit into a coherent picture are: Semidirect product as left adjoint ; Semidirect product in terms of torsors ; Semidirect product as a homotopy quotient ; Semidirect product in terms of subobjects of the product. I'll try to explain my struggles with each point. I started by trying to find a universal property and stumbled upon the first description, but I feel it did not help me even understand why semidirect products are interesting. Let $\mathsf{Grp^2}$ be the arrow category of the category of groups, and let $\mathsf{Grp}\circlearrowleft$ be the category of groups acting on groups: an object is a group action of a group $G$ on a group $H$ that respects all the operations, an arrow is an equivariant one. Such actions are in bijection with group homomorphisms $G\to \mathsf{Aut}(H)$. If these hold, we'll say $H$ is a $G$-group. The right adjoint is the forgetful functor $\mathsf{Grp^2}\to \mathsf{Grp}\circlearrowleft$ taking a group homomorphism to action by conjugation. The left adjoint, if I understand correctly, takes a $G$-group $\alpha:G\times H\to H$ to the inclusion $G\to H\rtimes G$. But why even care about $G$-groups? What is the semidirect product actually doing? Seeking intuition I hoped torsors might be related. Now, I don't know anything about torsors from the algebraic-geometry standpoint - for me a $G$-torsor is just a uniquely transitive $G$-set. John Baez's Torsors Made Easy and the linked answer made it clear torsors are somehow related to semidirect products, but I still don't get how, and still don't have a geometric picture of the semidirect product. What I understand of the answer is as follows: We start with an $H$-group $G$, and a $G$-torsor $S$. As a $G$-set, $S$ has $G$ as a group of autobijections. If we pick a unit in $S$ then we have a group isomorphism $G\cong S$ which makes $S$ into an $H$-group. This gives the set $S$ another group $H$ of autobijections. The semidirect product $G\rtimes H$ is the subgroup of $\mathsf{Sym}(S)$ generated by the subgroups $G,H\leq \mathsf{Sym}(S)$. But what is the geometry of this story? As the question itself mentions, the group $H$ seems to be keeping track of ""orientation"", while $G$ is doing the ""movement"". Does the semidirect product reflect the geometry of a torsor? I just don't get it. In Tao's Compactness and Contradiction I found a very useful page or two about torsors, with a brief discussion of the lamplighter group. The idea was to think of an element of $G$ as a ratio $\frac BA$ between elements in some convenient $G$-torsor of ""states"". This makes conjugation intuitive since $g\frac BA g^{-1}=\frac{gA}{gB}$ is the unique group element with initial state $gA$ and terminal state $gB$. I was very hopeful this intuitive approach might actually motivate the unpleasant multiplication of the semidirect product, but I haven't been able to make sense of that myself.

1999788,Weak convergence counter-example,"Given probability measures $\mu,\mu_n: \mathcal{B}(X)\to R$. Construct an example such that $$\langle f,\mu_n\rangle \rightarrow \langle f,\mu\rangle$$
for all convex function $f:X\to R$ but $\mu_n$ does not converge weakly to $\mu$. This question is from a problem in a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process. In there we can guarantee that starting from any initial prior $\pi$, for all cost function the ACOE has a bounded solution, which implies that $E[v(\pi_n)\mid\pi_0=\pi] \rightarrow C$. But the expected cost function $v(\pi)$ can only be a certain convex function of $\pi$ even if we allow all kind of cost function. So I wonder whether or not there's a counter-example saying that convex test function $f$ is not enough for weak convergence.

1999791,Inverse of a symmetric tridiagonal almost-Toeplitz matrix,"I'm trying to analytically find the inverse of the following $N \times N$ tridiagonal matrix: $$T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & -c \\
-c & 2 & -c \\
& -c & 2 & \ddots \\
& & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots \\
& & & \ddots  & 2 & -c \\
& & & & -c & 2 & -c \\
& & & & & -c & 1
\end{bmatrix}$$ That is, all elements just off the main diagonal are $-c$, where $c \in (0, 1)$; the main diagonal has a one in the top-left and in the bottom-right, and twos in between; and everything else is a zero. This comes from a statistical model I'm using (a CAR spatial model for a path graph) where, by construction, $T^{-1}$ is a covariance matrix.  Thus I know $T^{-1}$ is symmetric and the elements of its main diagonal are all positive.  I'd happily settle for only getting formulas for those main diagonal elements. Copying from the Wikipedia page on tridiagonal matrices (and doing a little bit of work), the $i$th diagonal element of $T^{-1}$ is $(T^{-1})_{ii} = \theta_{i-1} \theta_{N-i} / \theta_N$, where $$\theta_i = a_i \theta_{i-1} - c^2 \theta_{i-2} \text{ for } i = 2,3,\dots,N$$ with initial conditions $\theta_0 = \theta_1 = 1$.  The $a_i$ are the main diagonal elements of $T$, so e.g. if $N = 5$ then $\{a_i\} = \{1,2,2,2,1\}$.  One way to answer my question would be to solve the above recurrence relation, i.e. find a closed-form for $\theta_i$ for any $N \ge 2$.  (I tried this using a generating function, but got stuck due to the pesky non-constant diagonal of $T$, i.e. the $a_i$.) In the following related question, the person who answered it used a very different, very involved approach: Inverse of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix. .  There, the matrix to be inverted had a constant main diagonal, so it was easier.","['recurrence-relations', 'tridiagonal-matrices', 'matrices', 'generating-functions', 'linear-algebra']"
1999796,Constructing a nearly 0 stochastic process or stopping times,"I'm trying to define a stochastic process $X_t$ with values on $\mathbb{R}$ which has the following properties, for the time interval $t \in [0,T]$: $X_t$ takes values in $[0,1]$ $m(\{t \in [0,T] : X_t>0\})\leq \epsilon$, for some prescribed $\epsilon\geq 0$, where $m$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. $X_t$ is adapted to some other Lévy process $Z_t$ which takes values in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Most importantly I am looking for the following Stopping condition to hold: Let $\tau_1,...$ and $r_1,...$ be the hitting times corresponding to when $X_t>0$ and when $X_t$ first becomes $0$ again.  I want $r_i -\tau_i$ to be small, always but stochastic. I am not sure how to rigorously construct such a process...  Could I just have a sequence of stopping times (this seems to make sense) but then how do I enforce the 2 and 4th conditions?","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'stochastic-analysis', 'stopping-times']"
1999816,Dominated Convergence Theorem Exercise,"I am asked to find $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0^\infty n^2e^{-nx} \tan^{-1} x \, dx.$$ Here is my attempt. Write $$\int_0^\infty n^2e^{-nx}\tan^{-1}x \, dx=\int_0^1 n^2e^{-nx} \tan^{-1} x \,dx + \int_1^\infty n^2e^{-nx}\tan^{-1} x \, dx$$
$$=\int_0^{n^2} e^{-\frac x n} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac x {n^2}\right) \, dx+\int_1^\infty n^2 e^{-nx} \tan^{-1}x \, dx.$$ Then note that $$\left| 1_{(0,n^2)}(x)e^{-x/n}\tan^{-1} \left(\frac x {n^2}\right) \right| \le \frac \pi 2$$ for all $x>0$ and all $n\ge 1$ and $$|n^2e^{-nx}\tan^{-1}x| \le \frac{\pi}{2}\frac 2 {x^2}$$ for all $x\in [1,\infty)$ and all $n\ge 1$. Thus the dominated convergence gives $${\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_0^\infty 1_{(0,n^2)}(x)e^{-x/n}\tan^{-1} \left(\frac x {n^2}\right) \, dx = 0}$$ and $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_1^\infty n^2e^{-nx} \tan^{-1}x\,dx=0,$$ and hence $$\lim_{n \to \infty}\int_0^\infty n^2e^{-nx}\tan^{-1}x\,dx=0.$$ Is this correct? EDIT: Unfortunately the above is not correct (see Dr. MV's comment). The correct justification is shown below (given by Sangchul Lee).
$$\int_0^\infty n^2e^{-nx} \tan^{-1} xdx=\int_0^\infty ne^{-x} \tan^{-1} (\frac{x}{n}) \, dx.$$ Since $$|ne^{-x}\tan^{-1} (\frac{x}{n})|\le xe^{-x}$$ for all $x>0$ and all $n\ge1$ we deduce that  $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0^\infty n^2e^{-nx} \tan^{-1} x \, dx=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_0^\infty ne^{-x} \tan^{-1} (\frac{x}{n}) \, dx=\int_0^\infty \lim_{n
\to\infty}ne^{-x} \tan^{-1} (\frac{x}{n}) \, dx=\int_0^\infty xe^{-x} \, dx=1.$$ The point is that $\tan^{-1}x\le x$ for all $x\ge0$, an inequality I had forgotten!","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1999869,Evaluate $\int\frac1{1+x^n}dx$ for $n\in\mathbb R$,"I was wondering on how to evaluate the following indefinite integral for all $n\in\mathbb R$. $$\int\frac1{1+x^n}dx$$ It seems to be peculiar in that we have $$\begin{align}
\int\frac1{1+x^{-1}}dx&=x-\ln(x+1)+c\\
\int\frac1{1+x^0}dx&=\frac12x+c\\
\int\frac1{1+x^{1/2}}dx&=2\sqrt x-2\ln(1+\sqrt x)+c\\
\int\frac1{1+x^1}dx&=\ln(x+1)+c\\
\int\frac1{1+x^2}dx&=\arctan(x)+c\\
\int\frac1{1+x^3}dx&=\frac13\ln(1+x)-\frac2{3\sqrt3}\arctan\left(\sqrt{\frac43}\left(x-\frac12\right)\right)+c
\end{align}$$ Naturally, there appears to be some combination of $\ln$ and $\arctan$, though no simple formula arises to solve the general case. It is, however, easy to see that $$\int\frac1{1+x^{-n}}dx=\int1-\frac1{1+x^n}dx$$ So there is an easy enough connection between positive and negative $n$. Also, it is easy enough to find the series expansion, taking advantage of the above connection we just made to circumvent problems concerning convergence. $$\frac1{1+x^n}=1-x^n+x^{2n}-x^{3n}+\dots\forall\ |x|<1$$ $$\int\frac1{1+x^n}dx=c+x-\frac1{n+1}x^{n+1}+\frac1{2n+1}x^{2n+1}-\dots$$ $$=c+\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{kn+1}x^{kn+1}\ \forall\ |x|<1$$ Though this isn't very much along the lines of closed form. For $n=\frac ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are whole numbers, we can use the substitution $x=u^b$ to get $$\int\frac1{1+x^n}dx=\int\frac{bu^{b-1}}{1+u^a}du$$ though I'm unsure where that could lead. This reduces the integral down to $$\int\frac1{1+x^n}dx=b\int P(u)+\frac{u^{b-1-ak}}{1+u^a}du,\quad k\in\mathbb N$$ for some polynomial $P(u)$.  Though I'm still clueless as to how this can be advanced. How can I evaluate $\int\frac1{1+x^n}dx\ \forall\ n\in\mathbb R$ in closed form?  Can someone prove there at least exists some closed form solution for all $n\in\mathbb Q$ if the above is not possible?

1999916,What is the position of the maximal value of this bell-shaped function?,"Consider the following function :

The plot of this function (for $0 \le v < \infty$) shows an almost bell-shaped curve, so it has a single maximal value. Now, I would like to find the position $v = v_0(\alpha, d)$ of the maximal value of this function.  I need an analytical expression for $v_0(\alpha, d)$, probably an approximation.

EDIT : Function (1) describes the ""deformation"" of a black body luminosity caused by the expansion of space in a cosmology model.  From Wien's and Planck's laws, $\alpha$ should be around 3 (depending on the presence of gaz and dust).  $d$ describes the kind of fluid contained in the cosmological model.  We have $d = 3$ for a dust filled universe, and $d = 4$ for a radiation universe.  $d = 0$ for an empty universe with a cosmological constant.  Since $\frac{d}{2} + 1$ gives 2.5 for dust and 3 for radiation, I suspect that $\alpha$ should be close to $\frac{d}{2} + 1$ (while it is an independant parameter).  In this special case, it is easy to explicitely evaluate the integral in (1) and we get the special case

2000075,Ring of Sets vs Ring in Universal Algebra,"I actually want to continue this post . I believe the naming convention in Mathematics is consistent, such that there are no clearly distinguish objects have the same name. However, I'm not sure how to relate the Ring of Sets and the Ring in Universal Algebra . The definition of Ring in Universal Algebra is $R$ is an abelian group under addition, meaning that: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$ for all $a, b, c \in R$ ($+$ is associative). $a + b = b + a$ for all $a, b \in R$ ($+$ is commutative). There is an element $0 \in R$ such that $a + 0 = a$ for all $a \in R$ ($0$ is the additive identity). For each $a \in R$ there exists $−a \in R$ such that $a + (−a) = 0$ ($−a$ is the additive inverse of $a$). $R$ is a monoid under multiplication, meaning that: $(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)$ for all $a, b, c \in R$ ($·$ is associative). There is an element $1 \in R$ such that $a · 1 = a$ and $1 · a = a$ for all $a \in R$ ($1$ is the multiplicative identity). Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition: $a ⋅ (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c)$ for all $a, b, c \in R$ (left distributivity). $(b + c) · a = (b · a) + (c · a)$ for all $a, b, c \in R$ (right distributivity). Next, the definition of Ring of Sets is $A,B\in\mathcal{R}$ implies $A\cap B\in \mathcal {R}$ and $A,B\in \mathcal {R}$ implies $A\cup B\in \mathcal {R}$. Then, I tried to relate between this two definition. Let assume that $\cap$ is the additive operator. Then, $\mathcal {R}$ must contain the additive identity and inverse for all $A \in \mathcal {R}$. The additive identity is the whole element set $S$, such that for all $A \in \mathcal {R}, A \subseteq S$. It can be easily seen that $A \cap S = A$, for all $A \in \mathcal {R}$. Nevertheless, pick $A \in \mathcal{R}$, such that $A \subset S$. Then, $A$ doesn't have the inverse, i.e. no $B \in \mathcal{R}$, such that $A \cap B = S$. Let assume that $\cup$ is the additive operator. The argument is similar to (1). I might be wrong, but what I'm trying to say is the structure of Ring of Sets isn't consistent with the structure of general Ring. Kindly need your explanation.

2000110,"Is ""generalized"" singular homology/cohomology a thing? If not, why not?","From what I understand, the singular homology groups of a topological space are defined like so: Topological Particulars. There's a covariant functor $F : \mathbb{\Delta} \rightarrow \mathbf{Top}$ that assigns to each natural number $n$ the corresponding $n$-simplex. This yields a functor $$\mathbf{Top}(F-,-) : \Delta^{op} \times \mathbf{Top} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}.$$ Hence to each topological space $X$, we can assign a simplicial set $\mathbf{Top}(F-,X) : \Delta^{op} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}.$ General nonsense. We observe that every simplicial set induces a simplicial abelian group; that every simplicial abelian group induces a chain complex; and that chain complexes have homology and cohomology groups. Ergo, simplicial sets have homology/cohomology groups. Putting these together, we may speak of the homology and cohomology groups of a topological space $X$. However, the topological particulars don't seem too important. In fact, for any category $\mathbf{C}$ and any functor $F : \Delta \rightarrow \mathbf{C}$, there's a simplicial set $\mathbf{C}(F-,X)$ attached to each $X \in \mathbf{C}$, and therefore $X$ has homology and cohomology. For example, the underlying set functor $U : \mathbf{CMon} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$ has a left-adjoint $F : \mathbf{Set} \rightarrow \mathbf{CMon}$. But since $\Delta \subseteq \mathbf{Set}$ and $\mathbf{CMon} \subseteq \mathbf{Mon}$, this yields a functor $F : \Delta \rightarrow \mathbf{Mon}$.

By using Cauchy's estimate, we can write $|f^n(0)| \leq \frac{n! M}{R^n}$ . Since this holds for any $R>0$ , it follows that for $n\geq 2$ , $|f^n(0)| \leq 0$ . This implies that $f^n(0) = 0$ for $n\geq 2$ . Hence $f$ is a polynomial of degree at most $1$ . Edit 1 : On the circle $|z| = R$ , $|f(z)|\leq A + B R^{3/2}$ . Thank you very much.

If $\,(a,b,c)\,$ and $\,b\,$ differs $\,-1\,$ from $\,c\,$ the other sid is the square root of the sum $\,a = \sqrt{b+c}$ .

2000414,Are all derivations of real-valued functions derivatives?,"To me it was obvious that all derivatives are derivations, since one can show that they are linear and satisfy the product rule. However, I was very surprised when I learned that every derivation of $C^{\infty}$ functions of a (smooth) manifold is essentially a directional derivative. The definition of a derivation is very simple and consists of two purely algebraic properties, while the definition of directional derivative should seemingly be inseparable from purely analytic notions like limits, Caucy/metric completeness, and the least upper bound property (although these notions may actually be purely topological, see here , although in any case they are not algebraic). However, the proof (see my community-wiki ""answer"" below) relies in a seemingly essential way on Taylor's theorem and its generalizations, and thus on the twice differentiability of the functions. This would seem to explain why calculus is taught in terms of derivatives and not derivations, in spite of the latter's greater simplicity, because to show that they are equivalent requires Taylor's theorem, which to understand requires a prior understanding of what differentiation is, and in any case is usually taught first in the second semester. Question: When we require only first differentiability and not second differentiability or continuous differentiability, is it still the case that all derivations are differential operators? Are there no derivations defined on the space of continuous real-valued functions? I.e., in every context where both derivatives and differentiation are defined, are derivations really exactly the same thing as derivatives? Or only when derivations are restricted to those functions for which Taylor's theorem holds? I have heard of there existing derivations for fields that are not even metrically complete, such as the finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p$ , and since the definition is really so much simpler than that of the derivative, I would be really surprised if they coincided exactly whenever both existed.

2000421,How did early mathematicians make it without Set theory?,"It is said that Cauchy was a pioneer of rigour in calculus and a founder of complex analysis. Yet if baffles me as set theory was an invention of the 1870s, 20 years after the death of Cauchy. Currently the beginning of most concepts in mathematics begins with the concept of set. Furthermore the concept of groups whose foundations were laid by Galois and Abel were done so long before set theory. I hope there is a genral way to answer these questions 1) We define functions with a domain and range both being sets. But when Cauchy used the symbol 'f(x)', what did it really mean to him? As Cauchy was notorious for his rigorous approach, it is hard to believe that he may have just used the word function ambiguously with intuitive satisfaction. (If the following question makes the topic too broad I'd be more than happy to list it as a separate question. 2)To a certain extent I can even brush away the idea of functions before sets. But I simply cannot grasp how the concept of group was formulated without a set and I'm puzzled as to how Galois and Abel were independently able to frame methods to prove the unsolvability of the quintic (these days the proof makes generous use of set theory)without sets. In these days where N, Z, Q and R all sets, how did the early masters do what they did?

Let $A$ be the event that each $(r-1)$-tuple is contained in at least one edge. For $\epsilon>0$, show that:
  $$\mathbb P(A)\rightarrow 
 \begin{cases} 
      0 & \text{if } p\leq (1-\epsilon)\frac{(r-1)\ln{n}}{n} \\
      1 & \text{if } p\geq (1+\epsilon)\frac{(r-1)\ln{n}}{n}

$\mathbb E(X_t)=\mathbb P(X_t=1)=(1-p)^{n-r+1}$, as there are $n-r+1$ such $r$-tuples containing $t$. Now $\displaystyle \mathbb P(A)=\mathbb P(\sum X_t=0)\ge 1-\sum_t P(X_t=1)=1-\binom{n}{r-1}(1-p)^{n-r+1}$. Now if $p\geq (1+\epsilon)\frac{(r-1)\ln{n}}{n}$, then clearly
$$\binom{n}{r-1}(1-p)^{n-r+1}\le \binom{n}{r-1}\left(1-(1+\epsilon)\frac{(r-1)\ln{n}}{n}\right)^{n-r+1} \rightarrow 0$$
by applying $\binom{n}{r-1}\le \left(\frac{en}{r-1}\right)^{r-1}$ and $1+x\le e^x$ for the second factor. So this gives the second case, however I don't know what to do about the first one.","['combinatorics', 'graph-theory', 'probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Therefore, we can put the $N$-th ball into any bucket. the previous $N-1$ balls have made $m-1$ buckets satisfies the condition, we are left with one empty bucket, the $N$-th ball must be put into that empty bucket.

Or is the case that this equation of the form $$z= f(x_1,x_2, \ldots x_{n-1}) +[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} (x_1,x_2, \ldots x_{n-1} ) ](x-x_1)+ \cdots + [\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n-1}} (x_1,x_2, \ldots x_{n-1})](x- x_{n-1})$$

$\mathbb R^n$? Question2 :
Can someone prove either of these statements if they are true or suggest where I might find it?

For part (a) I have: Let $x \in G$. Define $f: G/C_G(x) \to C_x$ by $f(gC_G(x))=gxg^{-1}$. Note that $f$ is well defined since if $gC_G(x)=hC_G(x)$ then $h^{-1}g C_G(x)=C_G(x)$ which means that $h^{-1}g \in C_G(x)$, so $h^{-1}gx=xh^{-1}g$ that is $gxg^{-1}=hxh^{-1}$, thus $f(g)=f(h).$ The same reasoning in opposite way shows that $f$ is injective. Moreover $f$ is trivially onto, then $f$ is a bijection. Therefore $|G/C_G(x)|=[G:C_G(x)]=\frac{|G|}{|C_G(x)|}=|C_x|.$ For part (b) I have. Since $N$ is proper and it is not contained in $Z(G)$, then let $x \in N-Z(G)$, then by part (a) and by taking $H=C_G(x)$ we have $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$ as if $H=G$ we have $x \in Z(G).$ Moreover, by our formula in part (a) we have $|G|=|H||C_x|.$ Now I am trying to show that $|C_x|$ is strictly less than $|H|$, then we are done. I know that $|C_x|$is less then $|N|$ because since $N$ is normal to $G$ and $x \in N$ we have $gxg^{-1} \in N$ for all $g \in G$. Then I have $|C_x|<|N|$.

I came up with the following, but I didn't quite like the proof, and was wondering if someone could offer a proof utilizing Laplace transforms, or something of that flavor. Here are the following ways I have tried to show it. 1) $f'(t) =\lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(t+h) - f(t-h)}{h} = f(t) f'(0) = f(t)$ a Therefore by differential equations we get our desired result. 2) using laplace transform on $f(t+a) = f(t)f(a)$. First notice that $f(t)$ cannot be zero anywhere (assume its zero at $x$, then $f(t) = f(t+x-x) = f(t-x)f(x) = 0)$. Since it cannot be zero, we know $F(s)$ is not zero anywhere (integral of a strictly positive function is strictly positive function is strictly positive). Therefore, we have $F(S)e^{Sa} = F(S)f(a)$ which is equivalent to $0 = F(S) (e^{Sa}-f(a))$. Which is only true if $e^{Sa} = f(a)$ for all $S$, and a fixed. However, this is only true if $a = 0\dots$ So I am not sure what I am doing wrong here... I wanted to try and prove it using Laplace transforms.

Yet when we have $x^2 = 4,$ we write $x = \pm\sqrt{4} \Longrightarrow x = -2, 2$ . The problem is that if I take the 1st equation, and square both sides, I get $$x = \sqrt{4} \Longrightarrow x^2 = 4 \Longrightarrow x = \pm\sqrt{4} \Longrightarrow x = -2, 2$$ My teacher says that if you introduce the radical sign, use $\pm$ , but those two equations are the same under the rules about radicals she taught us, so the ""taking the positive root"" rule feels arbitrary to me. I get that people want to make the radical mean something without ambiguity, but making arbitrary rules, like taking just the positive answer, seems to confuse things and lead to inconsistency, like in the above. There are other examples, such as solving for $x$ , then substituting the original equation with the value of $x$ , and not getting it to work because you can only take the positive root. For things like the Pythagorean theorem, people like to say it's obvious to take the positive one only, but there are ways to represent the Pythagorean theorem without relying on human judgement to decipher the final answer.  Say you have a right triangle with legs $a=3$ , $b=4$ , and you want to find c.  So you do: $3^2 + 4^2 = c^2$ , $c > 0$ . and solve the systems of equations, just like any other: $c = \pm\sqrt{25} \Longrightarrow c = -5, 5$ . $c = -5, 5$ intersects $c > 0$ at $c = 5$ , so the answer is $c = 5$ .  I don't see why you would need to redefine square root: $\pm\sqrt{}$ to mean principal square root : $\sqrt{}$ to find the correct answer. Does the ""taking the positive root"" rule have something to do with imaginary numbers, or am I missing something?

2001893,How to justify Einstein notation manipulations without explicitly writing sums?,"In calculating the expression for the coordinates of the Lie Bracket of two vector fields, one has to ""interchange the roles of the dummy indices $i$ and $j$ in the second term"" (p.187, Lee Introduction to Smooth Manifolds ) i.e. justify the following equality: $$X^j \frac{\partial Y^i}{\partial x\ ^j} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} - Y^i \frac{\partial X^j}{\partial x^i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x\ ^j} \overset{?}{=} X^j \frac{\partial Y^i}{\partial x\ ^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} - Y^j\frac{\partial X^i}{\partial x\ ^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}. $$ Now writing out the sums explicitly this is fairly easy to do: $$\sum_i\sum_j \left[X^j \frac{\partial Y^i}{\partial x\ ^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} - Y^i \frac{\partial X^j}{\partial x^i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j} \right] = \sum_i\sum_j\left[X^j \frac{\partial Y^i}{\partial x\ ^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \right] - \sum_i\sum_j\left[ Y^i \frac{\partial X^j}{\partial x^i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^j} \right] \\ = \sum_i\sum_j\left[X^j \frac{\partial Y^i}{\partial x\ ^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \right] - \sum_j\sum_i \left[ Y^j \frac{\partial X^i}{\partial x^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \right] = \sum_i\sum_j\left[X^j \frac{\partial Y^i}{\partial x\ ^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \right] - \sum_i\sum_j \left[ Y^j \frac{\partial X^i}{\partial x^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \right] \\ = \sum_i\sum_j \left[X^j \frac{\partial Y^i}{\partial x\ ^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} - Y^j \frac{\partial X^i}{\partial x^j}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \right] .$$ However, writing out all of these sums is fairly laborous and defeats the purpose of using Einstein notation in the first place. Question: Is there a list somewhere of allowed manipulations using Einstein notation? I would like to use such a list to rigorously justify manipulations like the above using Einstein notation in the future with a clean conscience. I could probably supply the proofs writing out the sums explicitly myself, so the list of allowed manipulations doesn't need to come with proofs for all of the rules. Note: This is related to a previous question of mine , where I asked (essentially) whether and if so which and how many manipulations using Einstein notation require finiteness of the index sets in order to be justified. Note that the above calculation is another example where the finiteness of the indexing sets is appealed to implicitly in order to justify switching the order of summation in the second-to-last step (the third-to-last step consists simply of renaming variables).","['reference-request', 'notation', 'differential-geometry']"
2001898,$f''+f \ge 0$ implies $f(x)+f(x+\pi) \ge 0$,"Let $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function of class $C^2$ satisfying $f''(t)+f(t) \ge 0$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$. Show that $f(t)+f(t+\pi) \ge 0$. What I did: Set $f''(t)+f(t)=g(t)$. This is an LDE of order 2, and we denote this equation by (E), and the corresponding homegoneous equation by (H). and $f$ is of the form $A\cos(t)+B\sin(t)+y_0(t)$ where $y_0(t)$ is a particular solution of (E), $A,B$ are constants. The trigonometric part cancels in the evaluation of $f(t)+f(t+\pi)$, so the problem boils down to finding a $y_0(t)$ which is always nonnegative. Well let's search for such a $y_0(t)$ using the technique of reductin of order, i.e let's set $y_0(t)=\lambda y_h(t)$ where $y_h(t)$ is a particular solution of $(H)$. All solutions of $(H)$ are sinusoidal so if this method is going to work we might as well set $y_0(t)=\lambda \sin(t)$. Substituting, we find $\sin(t)\lambda''+2\cos(t)\lambda'=g$. So if $\sin(t)=0$, $\lambda'=g(t)/2$. Let $I_{2k}=(2k\pi,(2k+1)\pi)$, $I_{2k+1}=((2k+1)\pi,(2k+2)\pi)$. Define $L_I=2k\pi$ if $I=I_{2k}$, $L_I=(2k+1)*\pi$ if $I=I_{2k+1}$. If $I \in \{I_{2k},I_{2k+1}\}$ we have $(\frac{d}{dt} [\lambda'\sin(t)])/\sin^2(t)=g$ for all $t \in I$ $\lambda'\sin^2(t)=\int^t_{L_I} g(u)\sin(u)\,du+C_I$ for all $t \in I$ where $C_I$ is a constant of integration.Note that the integral is well-defined since $gsin(u)$ is continuous, and the integral is therefore itself continuous. Note that if $I=I_{2k}$, then the integrand is positive, and $\sin^2(t)$  is always positive, so if we choose $C_I$ correctly then $\lambda'$ is positive. The opposite holds if $I=I_{2k+1}$. This is good because we want $\lambda$ positive on $I_{2k}$ and negative on $I_{2k+1}$. Now note that $\lambda'$ is continuous on all the $I$'s. However if we impose that $\lambda'$ be continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ then we run into a problem because 
$\lim_{t \to L_I, t>L_I}RHS=C_I$, which must be equal to $\lambda'(L_I)\sin^2(L_I)=0$, for all $I$. But then 
$\lim_{t \to L_I, t<L_I}RHS=\int^{L_I}_{L_I'} g(u)\sin(u)\,du=0$, where $I'$ is the interval that precedes $I$. Of course in general $g$ doesn't have to satisfy this. So this method kind of breaks down when we consider continuity but I believe it gives a function $f$ which is continuous and differentiable everywhere (and nonnegative, if we choose $C_I=0$) except for the points $L_I$.
