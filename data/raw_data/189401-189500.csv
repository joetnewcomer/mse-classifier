3550332,Proving Division Rings of $p^2$ Elements are Fields,"Exercise III.2.11 (Aluffi, Algebra Ch 0): Let $R$ be a division ring consisting of $p^2$ elements, where $p$ is a prime. Prove that $R$ is commutative (and thus $R$ is a field). Note: I do so without invoking Wedderburn's Theorem, that every finite division ring is a field. Also, within the context of this text, Rings must include unity. Proof Assume towards a contradiction that $R$ is not commutative. Then it's center, $C$ , is a proper subring of $R$ . Now, since $|R| = p^2$ , $|C| = p$ , as subrings are also subgroups and thus by Lagrange's Theorem $|C|$ must divide $|R|$ . Notice that since $0_R, 1_R \in C$ , $|C| > 1$ . Now, let $r \in R, r \not \in C$ be arbitrary. Notice that the centralizer of $r$ contains both $r$ and $C$ , as r commutes with itself and the center is the intersection of all centralizers. Thus the centralizer must contains more than $p$ elements. Since the centralizer is also a subring, this forces the centralizer to be all of $R$ . Lastly, since $r$ was arbitrary it follows the centralizer for every element is all of $R$ . Therefore, the center of $R$ is $R$ and thus we have a contradiction and it follows that $R$ is commutative. Personal Notes: I feel that this proof is a little wordy, but beyond that I'm curious for any advice on if there is a necessity for more clarity or if there are any elements that should be cut from the proof.","['division-ring', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'solution-verification']"

3550436,Action of $SO(4)$ on $\Lambda^2 \mathbb{R}^4$,"I'm beginning to study $4$ -dimensional Riemannian manifolds, in particular the decomposition induced by the Hodge $\star$ -operator on the space of the differential two-forms. I'm considering $\mathbb{R}^4$ as an example: I understood that $\Lambda^2 \mathbb{R}^4=\Lambda_{+}\oplus \Lambda_{-}$ , where $\Lambda_{\pm}$ is the eigenspace of $\star$ relative to the eigenvalue $\pm 1$ . The group $SO(4)$ acts on $\Lambda^2 \mathbb{R}^4$ in the standard way induced by the action of $SO(4)$ on $\mathbb{R}^4$ , i.e. if $X\in SO(4)$ and $a\wedge b$ is a two-form, then $X(a\wedge b)=Xa\wedge Xb$ . I've got three questions: $1)$ Since $\Lambda^2 \mathbb{R}^4\cong so(4)$ (the Lie algebra of $SO(4)$ ), are there some relations between the action of $SO(4)$ on $\Lambda^2 \mathbb{R}^4$ and the adjoint action of $SO(4)$ on $so(4)$ ? $2)$ What is the action of $SO(4)$ on $\Lambda^2 \mathbb{R}^4$ when restricted to $\Lambda_{\pm}$ ? I know that $so(4)\cong so(3)\oplus so(3)$ , so I thought it could be useful to compute the action, but I don't know how to do it. $3)$ I read that the restriction of the action to $\Lambda_{\pm}$ induces a surjective homomorphism $\phi:SO(4)\rightarrow SO(3)\times SO(3)$ which is two to one. How can I prove this and compute the homomorphism? I understood that there is a surjective homomorphism from $SU(2)$ to $SO(3)$ and that $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ is the universal cover of $SO(4)$ (a double cover, in particular): could it be useful?","['lie-algebras', 'riemannian-geometry', 'group-theory', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"
3550471,"Helical ""packing"" of deltahedra?","I'm looking for help with terminology: I'm a glass artist / PhD researcher aiming to use a modular, geometric approach to making.  I've been looking to use repeated polyhedra (with regular polygonal faces) as a modular substructure to hold more complex 'decorative' units. With so many options, I've initially limited myself to the convex deltahedra - and have been exploring how these can be put together. Rather than close packing, as is possible with the octahedron/tetrahedron, I'm interested in more loosely packed structures and formations. I found that I can create a wide variety of helical formations from pairs of the convex deltahedra. (Screen grabs of a two example CAD models below) With not having the correct words/terminology to describe these, I'm having trouble finding relevant work to read - or any areas of applied maths which might be relevant. I think that this is part of Topology - but is there a more specific area I should be looking at? And are these helices a form of packing - as the structure is only repeated in one rather than three dimensions? The closest thing I've found, is the Boerdijk-Coxeter helix - which does seem to relate to spherical packing. Also are the radius and vertical offset the only characteristics which I need to specify in order to designate the underlying helix, or do I need to consider other characteristics? Any pointers greatly appreciated.","['polyhedra', 'geometry', 'applications', 'packing-problem']"

3550588,"When tackling trig identities, which side is the best to start from?","I'm currently in Y13. I wanted to know which side of a trig identity is typically best to work from (since I know you have to work from one side to the other). Here's an example of an identity I just proved: $$\tan(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{x}{2}) = \sec(x)-\tan(x)$$ I figured out the proof after a false start by working from both ends, then putting the steps together. But working from the RHS is a lot more straightforward than the LHS; the latter requires you to deduce that: $$\frac{1-\tan(\frac{x}{2})}{1+\tan(\frac{x}{2})} = \frac{(1-\tan(\frac{x}{2}))^2}{1-\tan^2(\frac{x}{2})}$$ which is fine, but not immediately obvious. Even if you continue working in this direction, the next steps are not very reassuring either. I was trying to multiply by $\frac{1+\tan(\frac{x}{2})}{1+\tan(\frac{x}{2})}$ , which wasn't very helpful. So I was wondering: are there any giveaway signs that one side of the identity will be easier to work from than the other? In hindsight, for this one, the double angles on the RHS were much easier to manipulate than the angle addition on the LHS. Is there a sort of hierarchy anyone has learnt from their experience?","['trigonometry', 'proof-writing']"
3550591,"(Proof Updated, Verification in Need) Show that $(s,t)\mapsto t\wedge s$ for $s,t\geq 0$ and $(s,t)\mapsto e^{-|t-s|}$ are positive semi-definite.","We say a positive symmetric $n\times n$ matrix $M$ over $\mathbb{R}^n$ is semi-definite if $v^{\intercal}Mv\geq 0$ for all nonzero $v\in\mathbb{R}^n$ . We say a function $f:\mathbb{T}^2\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ to be positive semi-definite if $\Big(f(t_k, t_j)\Big)_{k,j=1}^n$ is a positive semi-definite matrix for all $(t_k)_{k=1}^n\in\mathbb{T}^n$ With this definition, I am working on an exercise asking me to show $(1)$ the function $f:(s,t)\mapsto t\wedge s$ defined for $s,t\geq 0$ is positive semi-definite; $(2)$ the function $c:(s,t)\mapsto e^{-|t-s|}$ is positive semi-definite. For the first one, I tried to use the fact that $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^{+}}\mathbb{1}_{[0,t]}\mathbb{1}_{[0,s]} \,d\mu = t\wedge s,$$ so that each term in the matrix is of the form $b_{i,j}:=f(t_i,t_j)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{+}}\mathbb{1}_{[0,t_{j}]} \mathbb{1}_{[0,t_{}} \, d\mu$ , for $t,j=1,\cdots,n$ . Let $v=(v_1,\ldots, v_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ , then $$v^{\intercal} Mv=a_1 \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_{i,1}+a_2\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_{i,2} + a_3 \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_{i,3}+\cdots+a_n \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_{i,n}.$$ But then I don't know what to do next.. For the second one, the exercise gives an hint: using an auxiliary Hilbert space $H$ and a $h_t\in H$ such that $\langle h_t, h_s\rangle=c(s,t)\ldots$ I don't really know how to use this hint... I really need an answer with some details, since this is an exercise in Stochastic Process, instead of functional analysis and so forth, so I don't have enough background of this... Thank you so much! Edit 1: (Proof of the first one) Following MaoWao 's suggestion, I think I proved the first one. Firstly let me claim that if $H$ is a Hilbert space, then its corresponding inner product $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle_H:H\times H\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is positive semi-definite. Indeed, we have for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , $x_1,\ldots, x_n \in H$ and $c_1,\ldots, c_n \in\mathbb{R}$ that $$\sum_{i,j=1}^n c_i c_j \langle x_i,x_j\rangle_H = \left<\sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_i,\sum_{j=1}^n c_j x_j \right>_H =\Big\|\sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_i\Big\|_H^2\geq 0.$$ In fact, the above result also holds for pre-Hilbert space, since the notion of completeness was not involved in the above argument. Thus, we only need to find a specific (pre-)Hilbert Space $H$ and a $h_{t}\in H$ such that $\langle h_t, h_s\rangle_H = t\wedge s$ . But this is easy, let's consider $H:=L^2(\mathbb{R}_{+})$ , and $h_t:=\mathbb{1}_{[0,t]}$ . It is clear that $h_t\in H$ , and for any $t,s\geq 0$ , we have $$\langle h_t, h_s\rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{R}_{+})} = \int_{\mathbb{R}_{+}}\mathbb{1}_{[0,t]} \mathbb{1}_{[0,s]} \, d\mu=t\wedge s,$$ and thus we are done. Edit 2: (Proof of the second one) I've searched all over the places. The function in $(2)$ is Abel kernel, but it is rarely discussed since Abel kernel is closely related to Poisson kernel, and most of the discussions are on the latter. Later, I found a really close one: the Gaussian kernel and here is a link about the proof of Gaussian kernel is really a kernel. That is, it is positive semidefinite. https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/35634/how-to-prove-that-the-radial-basis-function-is-a-kernel In this link, one answer used the characteristic function. This greatly inspired me. I also found a characteristic function, which is the one for Cauchy distribution. Below is the proof: Recall the Cauchy Distribution $(x_{0},\gamma)$ with $\gamma>0$ has the characteristic function $$\varphi(t)=e^{ix_{0}t-\gamma|t|}.$$ Using this, we can write $c(s,t)=h(s-t)$ where $h(t):=e^{-|t|}=\mathbb{E}e^{itZ}$ is the characteristic function of a random variable $Z$ with Cauchy $(0,1)$ distribution. Then for real numbers $x_{1},\cdots, x_{n}$ and $a_{1},\cdots, a_{n}$ , we have \begin{align*}
\sum_{j,k=1}^{n}a_{j}a_{k}h(x_{j}-x_{k})&=\sum_{j,k=1}^{n}a_{j}a_{k}\mathbb{E}e^{i(x_{j}-x_{k})Z}\\
&=\mathbb{E}\Big(\sum_{j,k=1}^{n}a_{j}e^{ix_{j}Z}a_{k}e^{-ix_{k}Z}\Big)\\
&=\mathbb{E}\Big(\Big|\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{j}e^{ix_{j}Z}\Big|^{2}\Big)\geq 0.
\end{align*} Thus, $c$ is positive semi-definite. It seems that I did not use the hint at all for part $(2)$ , so I believe there must be another way. I do need someone to check if my proof in the edit 1 and edit 2 is correct. I am gonna open a bounty in 19 hours later, for proof checking and possible new proof.

3550614,Part of proof of Yoneda's Lemma from Vakil,"I am trying to understand the second half of the proof of Yoneda's Lemma, which is given as a problem in Vakil's notes. So suppose we have two objects $A$ and $A'$ in a Category $D$ , and morphisms $i_C:Mor(C, A) → Mor(C,A′)$ that commute with the maps $Mor(C,A) → Mor(B,A)$ , which are induced by some morphism $f:B→C$ . Then I have shown that the $i_C$ (as $C$ ranges over the objects of $D$ ) are induced from a unique morphism $g: A → A′$ . Specifically, there is a unique morphism $g: A → A′$ such that for all $C \in D$ , $i_C$ is given by $u\mapsto g\circ u$ . Now, the next part of the problem, labelled (b), asks to show that if all the $i_C$ are bijections, then $g$ is actually an isomorphism. Now, the diagram that was useful for the first part is the following: $$\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
\operatorname{Mor}(A,A) @>{i_A}>> \operatorname{Mor}(A,A')\\
@V{}VV @V{}VV \\
\operatorname{Mor}(C,A) @>{i_C}>> \operatorname{Mor}(C,A')
\end{CD}$$ However, I am having trouble seeing how to apply this to (b). I know that $i_A(Id_A)=g\circ Id_A=g$ . Further, since the sets $\operatorname{Mor}(A,A)$ and $\operatorname{Mor}(A,A')$ are in bijection with each other, $g$ maps back to $Id_A$ via postcompositon with some morphism $h:A'\rightarrow A$ , giving $g$ a left inverse. Is this correct? If the right inverse for $g$ can be constructed in a similar manner, does this give the result?","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'yoneda-lemma', 'category-theory']"
3550700,Is there a generalized solution to the birthday problem? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Probability of 3 people in a room of 30 having the same birthday (9 answers) Closed 4 years ago . The problem of the calculating the probability that there is a birthday shared by at least 2 people in a group of size n is well known. I am wondering if there is a way of finding the probability of there being a birthday shared by m people in a group of size n. I couldn't find any info about this online and was unable to solve it myself. The particular question asked by a friend of mine was on the chances of there being some day which is at least 4 peoples birthday from a group of 50. I was able to get the answer through a monte-carlo simulation, but am still interested in an analytic solution. Edit: I have since solved the problem, using Bernoulli trials, a technique I just learned in my discrete math class. The general formula is $1-\left(\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\operatorname{nCr}\left(n,i\right)\cdot\frac{1}{365}^{i}\cdot\frac{364}{365}^{\left(50-i\right)}\right)^{365}$ . The part inside the sum is the chance of, for a fixed day, that there are exactly i shared birthdays. The sum finds the chance that there are less than m shared birthdays. Raising this to the power of 365 finds the chance that there are less than m shared birthdays every day. Subtracting this from 1 gets the chance that there are m or more shared birthdays. The answer I got for the specific case agreed with my simulation within +-.000001.","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics', 'birthday', 'probability']"

3550832,Why does the curl vector point along the axis of rotation?,"Thanks for reading. Say we have a vector-field $F=P(x,y,z)\hat{i}+Q(x,y,z)\hat{j}+R(x,y,z)\hat{z}$ , and we compute the curl of $F$ at some point $(x,y,z)$ by calculating $\nabla \times F$ at that point. Geometrically, I intuitively understand the components of the resulting vector. The $\hat{i}$ component will be a vector representing the curl of the vector field on the $(y,z)$ plane. The $\hat{j}$ component will be a vector representing the curl of the vector field on the $(x,z)$ plane. The $\hat{k}$ component will be a vector representing the curl of the vector field on the $(x,y)$ plane. Additionally, I geometrically understand each of the resulting ""curls"" independently, and their equations independently (for example, I understand why $(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y})\hat{k}$ gives us the curl on the $xy$ plane at that point). However, sources online (Khan Academy) say that the overall resulting vector points ""orthogonal to the overall direction of rotation at $(x,y,z)$ "". And that...I don't intuitively understand. That is, why is it that the fact that each of the resulting components of $\nabla \times F$ represents the curl on one of the planes at a point $(x,y,z)$ imply that the overall resulting vector points perpendicular to the overall rotational direction at that point (following the right-hand rule)? Thanks! Edit: Take a look at this post from Wikipedia: Suppose the vector field describes the velocity field of a fluid flow
  (such as a large tank of liquid or gas) and a small ball is located
  within the fluid or gas (the centre of the ball being fixed at a
  certain point). If the ball has a rough surface, the fluid flowing
  past it will make it rotate. The rotation axis (oriented according to
  the right hand rule) points in the direction of the curl of the field
  at the centre of the ball, and the angular speed of the rotation is
  half the magnitude of the curl at this point. And then.... The curl of the vector at any point is given by the rotation of an
  infinitesimal area in the $xy$ -plane (for $z$ -axis component of the curl), $zx$ -plane (for $y$ -axis component of the curl) and $yz$ -plane (for $x$ -axis

Suppose $x, y \in M$ , and consider the Euclidean line segment $c(t) = (1-t)x + t y$ where $t$ is a scalar: $t \in [0..1]$ . Now, define a curve $p(t) \in M$ by projecting $c(t)$ onto $M$ . Thus: $p(t) = Proj_{M} (c(t)) = \arg\min_{p \in M} \|p - c(t)\|_2$ . I'm wondering if there is a relation between the geodesic on $M$ between $x$ and $y$ and the length of the curve $p(t)$ (which must lie on $M$ by definition). Any simplifying assumptions such as $M$ being compact, without boundary and with a positive reach are OK in my context. For example, if $M$ is a sphere, then it seems that $p(t)$ will trace the geodesic between $x$ and $y$ , unless they are on the poles. Is there a characterization of this situation? Is this true locally (e.g., for $y$ in the neighborhood of $x$ )? To me, it seems that $p(t)$ must provide a better estimate of the geodesic, but I cannot find relevant results.

Then we say that 𝑔 is best linear approximation of 𝑓 in the neighbourhood of 𝑎 if the following equation holds : $$ \lim_{x\to a}  \frac{f(x)-g(x)}{x-a}=0$$ Such a linear approximation exists if and only if 𝑓′(𝑎) exists and moreover in that case we have 𝑔(𝑥)=𝑓(𝑎)+𝑓′(𝑎)(𝑥−𝑎). This answer also uses this theorem to prove that the derivative is truly the best linear approximation. More like this is the 'sense' in which it is the best approximation. After researching online I found that the idea seems to be that the derivative is the only linear approximation for which the approximation error tends to $0$ faster than $𝑥-𝑎$ as $𝑥→𝑎$ , and based on this we call it the best approximation. My question is, how does this actually prove that the derivative will beat any other linear approximation?

Because I am missing $4$ kings and one card of number $2$ , it remains only $11$ out of $13$ values to get $4$ of a kind from. When we have chosen our value, we can choose the last ( $5^\text{th}$ ) card in $11 \times 43 = 473$ different ways (according to the multiplication principle). $11$ is the values that remain and $43$ is the cards that remain after I have pulled $4$ cards. $47$ cards from the start (because I am missing $5$ cards). 
The total of different poker hands is $\displaystyle \binom{47}{5}$ and the probability to get $4$ of a kind is therefore $$(11 \times 43) \div \dfrac{47 \times 46 \times 45 \times 44 \times 43}{1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5} = \frac{1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 11}{47 \times 46 \times 45 \times 44} = \frac{1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 11}{47 \times (2 \times 23) \times (5 \times 3 \times 3) \times (4 \times 11)} = \frac{1}{47 \times 23 \times 3} = 0,0003 = 0,03 \%$$ Is this a correct calculation?

3551304,Counter intuitive Prior/Posterior relationship in Bayesian inference for estimated probability fusion,"I am trying to infer the probability distribution of a binary variable $X$ (True or False) using observations $O = \langle O_1,O_2,\ldots,O_n\rangle$ , mutually independent given X. I also have a ML algorithm that takes an observation $o_i$ and learns to predict a score $s_i$ which, I imagine, is an estimation of the probability of X being True, $\forall i, s_i \approx P(X=T\mid O_i=o_i)$ . Now, I want to compute the probability of $P(X=T\mid O=o)$ since I have multiple observations that should improve the final score by fusing the estimated probabilities given by the ML algorithm.
Using Bayes formula I get: $$P(X=T\mid O=o) = \frac{P(O=o_1,o_2,\ldots,o_n\mid X=T)P(X=T)}{P(O=o_1,o_2,\ldots,o_n\mid X=T)P(X=T)+P(O=o_1,o_2,\ldots,o_t\mid X=F)P(X=F)}$$ And since I can now separate each observation probabilities since they are independent given $X$ , I get: $$P(X=T\mid O=o) = \frac{P(X=T)\displaystyle\prod_{i}^{n}P(O_i=o_i\mid X=T)}{P(X=T)\displaystyle\prod_{i}^{n}P(O_i=o_i\mid X=T)+P(X=F)\displaystyle\prod_{i}^{n}P(O_i=o_i\mid X=F)}$$ But now here comes a problem, I can't put a value on $P(o_i\mid X)$ , I only have $s_i \approx P(X=T\mid O_i=o_i)$ and the priors $P(X)$ , so I use Bayes formula once again on $P(o_i\mid X)$ . It seems to go well, the $P(O_i=o_i)$ are also simplified, but at the end I get this: $$P(X=T\mid O=o) \approx \frac{P(X=T)^{-n+1}{\displaystyle\prod_{i}^{n}s_i}}{P(X=T)^{-n+1}\displaystyle\prod_{i}^{n}{s_i} + P(X=F)^{-n+1}{\displaystyle\prod_{i}^{n}(1-s_i)}}$$ It seems like a nice formula, and has nice properties (for instance, predicted scores of 0.5 are neutral to the final posterior probability, given $n$ is constant or given uninformative priors). Unfortunately, it starts to look very wrong once you play with the prior. If you look closely, the priors $P(X)$ are driving the final probability toward the opposite probability. For instance, with a prior $P(X=T)=0.9$ , the final probability goes towards $0$ which is very weird since it seems to me that priors shouldn't work like this at all. However, the formula seems to work quite well when I set $P(X=T)=P(X=F)=0.5$ and doesn't have the usual downsides of computing the average of the score probabilities. So, my questions are: Is there something wrong with the proof, the assumptions or with the interpretation, or is this a correct formula with prior behaving counter-intuitively? Is there already a proof of a formula for doing probability fusion like this? And also, are there other cases of prior driving the posterior to the opposite probability?","['statistical-inference', 'statistics', 'bayesian', 'solution-verification', 'probability']"

3551452,Understanding the $L^{2}-$Limit of Gaussian Random Vectors,"I am working on an exercise stating as follows: Suppose the process $X_{t}$ is a Gaussian process, and let $H$ be the Hilbert space generated by $(X_{t})_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ , that is, the space consisting of $L^{2}-$ limits of linear combinations of values of $X_{t}$ .  Prove that every element in $H$ is a Gaussian random variable. The solution of the exercise said that: It suffices to prove the $L^{2}-$ limit of Gaussian random vectors is still a Gaussian random vector. That is, if $\vec{X}_{t}$ , $t=1,2,\cdots$ is a sequence of Gaussian random vectors with mean $\vec{\mu}_{t}$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma_{t}$ such that $\vec{X}_{t}\longrightarrow \vec{X}_{\infty}$ in $L^{2}$ , then $\vec{X}_{\infty}$ is a Gaussian random vector. Then it proved as follows: Recall that the convergence in $L^{2}$ of $\vec{X}_{t}$ to $\vec{X}_{\infty}$ implies $\vec{\mu}_{t}=\mathbb{E}\vec{X}_{t}$ converges to $\vec{\mu}_{\infty}=\mathbb{E}\vec{X}_{\infty}$ , and the
  element-wise convergence of covariance matrices $\Sigma_{t}$ to the
  corresponding covariance matrix $\Sigma_{\infty}$ . Further, the $L^{2}-$ convergence implies the corresponding convergence in
  probability and hence by the bounded convergence we have $$\varphi_{\vec{X}_{t}}(\vec{\theta})\longrightarrow
> \varphi_{\vec{X}_{\infty}}(\vec{\theta})\ \text{for each}\
 \vec{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}.$$ Since $\varphi_{\vec{X}_{t}}(\theta)=e^{i<\vec{\theta},\vec{\mu}_{t}>}e^{-\frac{1}{2}<\vec{\theta},
> \Sigma_{t}\vec{\theta}>}$ for any $t<\infty$ , it follows that the same
  applies for $t=\infty$ , it follows that the same applies for $t=\infty$ . It is a well-known fact of linear algebra that the element-wise limit $\Sigma_{\infty}$ of positive semi-definite matrices $\Sigma_{n}$ is
  necessarily also positive semi-definite. Thus, in view of the definition of Gaussian random vector using
  characteristic function, we see that the limit $\vec{X}_{\infty}$ is a
  Gaussian random vector, whose parameters are the limits of the
  corresponding parameters of $\vec{X}_{t}$ . I have three questions about this solution: Firstly, why is showing the $L^{2}-$ limit of Gaussian random vectors still being a Gaussian random vector sufficient? Is that because then we know that $<b,\vec{X}_{\infty}>$ is a Guassian random variable for all $b$ ? but where is $b$ living in? $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}$ ? Secondly, in the proof, why $\varphi_{X_{t}}(\vec{\theta})\longrightarrow \varphi_{X_{\infty}}(\vec{\theta})$ for all $\vec{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$ ? if we take the limit, should it be $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}$ ? I believe the first and the second questions are both around one point: how to understand the limit of Gaussian vectors: so this proof basically shows that the ""entires"" of the Guassian vector $\vec{X}_{t}$ is not increasing. It is always a $\mathbb{R}^{d}-$ valued random vector. But why and how? If we increase the limit, why does not the entries change? so the limit is not from $\vec{X}_{t}:=(Y_{1},\cdots, X_{t})\longrightarrow(Y_{1},\cdots, Y_{\infty})=\vec{X}_{\infty}$ ?

Numerics suggests that $I(n)\sim \frac{1}{\sqrt n}\left(k-\sqrt{k^2-1}\right)^{2n}$ , however I have not yet been able to formally prove this fact. This is not an homework question. Any help is welcome! Thanks in advance! Progress. I briefly sketch my attempt to solve the problem, hoping that someone may find this useful. Note that $g(x,y)$ is analytic in a neighborhood of $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}$ . Thus, we can shift the integral in the complex direction $it$ as long as $g$ remains analytic. This is indeed the case for all $$
t < t_0 :=  \cosh^{-1} k
    =  \ln  \left(k + \sqrt{k^2-1}\right)= -\frac1{2\pi} \ln  \left(k - \sqrt{k^2-1}\right).

I(n) &= e^{-2 n t_0}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}e^{ in(x+y)}\,g(x+it_0,y+it_0)\,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\\

I'(n) &= \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}e^{ in(x+y)}\,g(x+it_0,y+it_0)\,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\\ &=\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\frac{e^{i n (x+y)}}{K}\frac{(K^2(2-K^2e^{-2i x})-e^{-2ix})(K^2(2-K^2e^{-2i y})-e^{-2 iy}) }{K(4k-K(e^{- i x}+e^{- i y}))-e^{ i x}-e^{ i y}}\,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\\
\end{align*} where $K:=k+\sqrt{k^2-1}$ . Although the integrand of $I'(n)$ blows up at $x=0$ , $y=0$ , $I'(n)$ still converges absolutely, and I think it should be possible to prove that $I'(n)$ exhibits subexponential decay. As a further observation, note that by using the change of variables $z=e^{i x}$ , $t=e^{iy}$ , $I'(n)$ can be rewritten as $$
I'(n):=\oint_{|z|=1} \oint_{|t|=1} \frac{z^{n-2}t^{n-2}\left(2K^2z^2-K^4-z^4\right)\left(2K^2t^2-K^4-t^4\right)}{K\left(4kzt-K(z+t)\right)-(z+t)zt}\,\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}t.

Moreover, I feel like I came across questions or problems where sets would sometimes have repeated elements (perhaps problems in probability or combinatorics), but I may be mis-remembering this or it may have simply been an abuse of the notation.

Here $H_n$ denotes the $n$ th harmonic number $\sum_{k = 1}^n 1/k$ . $$S = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n H_n H_{2n}}{n^2}$$ What I have managed to do so far is to convert $S$ to two rather difficult integrals as follows. Starting with the result $$\frac{H_{2n}}{2n} = -\int_0^1 x^{2n - 1} \ln (1 - x) \, dx \tag1$$ Multiplying (1) by $(-1)^n H_n/n$ then summing the result from $n = 1$ to $\infty$ gives $$S = -2 \int_0^1 \frac{\ln (1 - x)}{x} \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n H_n}{n} x^{2n}. \tag2$$ From the following generating function for the harmonic numbers $$\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{H_n x^n}{n} = \frac{1}{2} \ln^2 (1 - x) + \operatorname{Li}_2 (x),$$ replacing $x$ with $-x^2$ leads to $$\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n H_n}{n} x^{2n} = \frac{1}{2} \ln^2 (1 + x^2) + \operatorname{Li}_2 (-x^2).$$ Substituting this result into (2) yields $$S = -2 \int_0^1 \frac{\ln (1 - x) \operatorname{Li}_2 (-x^2)}{x} \, dx - \int_0^1 \frac{\ln (1 - x) \ln^2 (1 + x^2)}{x} \, dx,$$ or, after integrating the first of the integrals by parts twice $$S = -\frac{5}{2} \zeta (4) + 4 \zeta (3) \ln 2 - 8 \int_0^1 \frac{x \operatorname{Li}_3 (x)}{1 + x^2} \, dx - \int_0^1 \frac{\ln (1 - x) \ln^2 (1 + x^2)}{x} \, dx. \tag3$$ I have a slim hope the first of these integrals can be found (I cannot find it). As for the second of the integrals, it is proving to be a little difficult. Can someone find each of the integrals appearing in (3)? Or perhaps an alternative approach to the sum will deliver the closed-form I seek, I am fine either way. Update Thanks to Ali Shather, the first of the integrals can be found. Here \begin{align}
\int_0^1 \frac{\ln (1 - x) \operatorname{Li}_2 (-x^2)}{x} \ dx &=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n^2}\int_0^1 x^{2n-1}\ln(1-x)\ dx\\
&= -\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^nH_{2n}}{2n^3}\\
&=-4\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^nH_{2n}}{(2n)^3}\\
&=-4 \operatorname{Re} \sum_{n=1}^\infty i^n\frac{H_n}{n^3}.
\end{align} And using the result I calculated here , namely $$\operatorname{Re} \sum_{n=1}^\infty i^n\frac{H_n}{n^3} = \frac{5}{8} \operatorname{Li}_4 \left (\frac{1}{2} \right ) - \frac{195}{256} \zeta (4) + \frac{5}{192} \ln^4 2 - \frac{5}{32} \zeta (2) \ln^2 2 + \frac{35}{64} \zeta (3) \ln 2,$$ gives \begin{align}
\int_0^1 \frac{\ln (1 - x) \operatorname{Li}_2 (-x^2)}{x} \, dx &= -\frac{5}{2} \operatorname{Li}_4 \left (\frac{1}{2} \right ) + \frac{195}{64} \zeta (4) - \frac{5}{48} \ln^4 2\\
& \qquad + \frac{5}{8} \zeta (2) \ln^2 2 - \frac{35}{16} \zeta (3) \ln 2.

The first chapters talks about considering the $\leq$ as a morphism and seeing if we have a category. I get the first requirement of associativity, but I'm having trouble with the identity morphism requirement. As I understand it, the identity morphism must satisfy $f\circ id_{A} = f$ and $id_{B}\circ f = f$ for some $f::A\rightarrow B$ . I'm confused here because it seems that $id$ simply returns its input so wouldn't $id$ always exist?

I don't follow the reasoning here; why does the fact that $a\leq a$ being always true imply an identity morphism?","['functions', 'category-theory']"

3552435,Projective $n$ - space is not affine over any ring $R$,"A similar question has been asked here already, but there was no final answer to the problem in the most general case. I wish to show that: For $n>1$ and a ring $R$ , the projective $n$ - space $\mathbb{P}_R^n$ is not affine unless $R=0$ . What I have so far: Assume $\mathbb{P}_R^n$ was affine, then $\mathbb{P}_R^n\simeq \operatorname{Spec}(R)$ . Now by construction $\mathbb{P}_R^n$ contains the affine subspace $\mathbb{A}_R^n\simeq \operatorname{Spec}(R[\frac{t_1}{t_0},...,\frac{t_1}{t_0}])$ as an open subscheme. Hence the inclusion $\mathbb{A}_R^n\hookrightarrow\mathbb{P}_R^n$ induces some ring homomorphism $R\rightarrow R[\frac{t_1}{t_0},...,\frac{t_1}{t_0}]$ . And that is about it...

He shows that if $\mathbb{P}_K^n = \operatorname{Spec}(K)$ was affine, it would be a one - point space and then constructs a bijection $\mathbb{P}_K^n(K')\leftrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n(K')$ , where the RHS is the ordinary projective $n$ - space over $K'$ .

3552533,Show that no non-constant polynomial can generate only prime numbers,"This problem is taken from ""Mathematics for Computer Science"" (Lehman, Leighton, Meyer, 2018). Problem For $n = 40$ , the value of the polynomial $p(n) := n^2 + n + 41$ is not prime, as noted in Section 1.1. But we could have predicted based on general principles that no non-constant polynomial can generate only prime numbers. In particular, let $q(n)$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients, and let $c:=q(0)$ be the constant term of $q$ . (a) Verify that $q(cm)$ is a multiple of $c$ for all $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ . (b) Show that if $q$ is nonconstant and $c > 1$ , then as $n$ ranges over the nonnegative integers $\mathbb{N}$ there are infinitely many $q(n) \in \mathbb{Z}$ that are not primes. Hint : You may assume the familiar fact that the magnitude of any nonconstant polynomial $q(n)$ grows unboundedly as $n$ grows. (c) Conclude that for every nonconstant polynomial $q$ there must be an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $q(n)$ is not prime. Hint : Only one easy case remains. Solution attempt (a) The polynomial can be expressed as $q(n) = c + a_1n + a_2n^2 + \cdots + a_kn^k$ . So, $q(cm) = c + a_1cm + a_2c^2m^2 + ... + a_kc^km^k$ . Since all terms of $q(cm)$ are divisible by $c$ , $q(cm)$ is a multiple of $c$ for all $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ . (b) As $n$ ranges over the nonnegative integers, it will range over infinitely many values of the form $n=cm$ ( $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ ). As shown in (a), for each $n=cm$ , $q(cm)$ is a multiple of $c$ . Therefore, assuming that the magnitude of $q(n)$ grows unboundedly as $n$ grows, this means that $q(n)$ will take infinitely many non-prime values. (c) Item (b) covered the cases where $c > 1$ . For nonconstant $q$ , two cases remain: $c < -1$ and $-1 \leq c \leq 1$ . For $c < -1$ , a similar argument to (b) applies: as $n$ ranges over the negative integers, it will range over infinitely many values of the form $n=cm$ (where $m$ is a negative integer). For each of these values, $q(n)$ is a multiple of $c$ . Therefore, assuming that the magnitude of $q(n)$ grows unboundedly as $n$ grows, this means that $q(n)$ will take infinitely many non-prime values. For $c -1 \leq c \leq 1$ , $q(0) = c$ is an example of root that is not prime. Therefore, for every nonconstant polynomial $q$ , there must be an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $q(n)$ is not prime.

Then, I defined the exterior covariant derivative (ECD) of $\mathfrak{g}$ -valued $k$ -forms with respect of the connection $\omega$ as the $\mathfrak{g}$ -valued $(k+1)$ -form given by: $ \mathrm{D}_{\omega}\theta \left( \Xi^{(1)},...,\Xi^{(k+1)}\right) = \mathrm{d}\theta\left(\Xi^{(1)}_{(H)},...,\Xi^{(k+1)}_{(H)}\right)$ where $\Xi^{(1)}_{(H)},...,\Xi^{(k+1)}_{(H)}$ are the horizontal parts of the vector fields $\Xi^{(1)},...,\Xi^{(k+1)}$ with respect of said connection. This means that in order to find the ECD of a form, one should first compute the usual differential of said form, and then contract it with the horizontal parts of $k+1$ vector fields via the connection. My goal is to calculate the exterior covariant derivative of the connection 1-form $\bar{\omega}$ , which according to the book I'm using as reference (""Natural and Gauge Natural Formalism for Classical Field Theories"" by Lorenzo Fatibene and Mauro Francaviglia), it should have this form: $
\mathrm{D}_{\omega}\bar{\omega}=\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Ad}^{A}_{D}(g^{-1})\left( \partial_{\mu}\omega^{D}_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}\omega^{D}_{\mu}+c^{D}_{\cdot BC}\omega^{B}_{\mu}\omega^{C}_{\nu}\right)\mathrm{d}x^{\mu}\wedge\mathrm{d}x^{\nu}\otimes T_{A}

3553079,Does every topological manifold admit a good or sufficient cover?,"A topological manifold (without boundary) is a locally euclidean Hausdorff space, which is second countable (or maybe only paracompact, that is to say make the definition as strict as you like). A good open cover of a space $X$ is an open cover $(U_i)_i$ , where every finite intersection $U_{i_1} \cap ... \cap U_{i_k}$ is either empty or contractible. I define a sufficient open cover to be a cover, where every finite intersection is either empty or a disjoint union of contractible spaces. Does every topological $n$ -manifold admit a good open cover or a sufficient open cover? All the information I could find about good covers of manifolds involved smooth or differentiable manifolds. On ncatlab it is only stated that the methods involved for proving the existence of good covers in the smooth case don't work in the topological case. No reference to a counterexample or other disprove is given. Note that I am not really (just sort of) interested in the cover being finite. As explained in this answer every $n$ -manifold admits a cover by $n+1$ charts. However there is no reason, why this cover should possibly be a good cover. The closest reference for finite good covers is (again according to ncatlab ) this paper by Osborn Stern. However the connectivity conditions confuse me and I don't quite understand how they replace the contractibility condition. My goal is to show in an axiomatic way (see my question here ) that for every closed $n$ -manifold the homology groups of order $>n$ vanish. I think the existence of a (possibly infinite) sufficient cover would open a way for showing this by induction on the (by compactness) finite number of sufficient opens involved. Of cause, the general existence of a finite sufficient cover would (if my inductive argument is correct) imply that for arbitrary topological $n$ -manifolds the higher homology groups vanish... I would not be surprised, if there is a good reason, why there is no good or sufficient cover in general. However, as I am fairly new to the subject of topological manifolds, I remain hopeful that there is one.

The neutral is $\infty$ . This follows from the first three cases of the definition of $\boxplus$ . The opposite $-x$ is computed as in $\Bbb Z_p$ when $x\ne\infty$ , and we define $-\infty$ as $\infty$ . That $x\boxplus(-x)=\infty=(-x)\boxplus x$ follows from the first and third cases of the definition. Associativity $(x\boxplus y)\boxplus z=x\boxplus(y\boxplus z)$ needs to be proved in multiple cases: When any of $x$ , $y$ or $z$ is $\infty$ , we use the first two cases of the definition.

3553247,"How do we make the ""intuitive calculation"" of conditional probability, rigorous?","The definition of Conditional Probability for events $A$ and $B$ in sample space $S$ is $$\mathbb{P}(A|B)=\frac{\mathbb{P}(A\cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}.$$ Sometimes, we use a rearranged version of this formula to calculate the probability of the intersection of events - called the multiplicative law of probability: $$\mathbb{P}(A\cap B)=\mathbb{P}(A|B)\times \mathbb{P}(B)$$ When using this formula, how does one calculate $\mathbb{P}(A|B)?$ Since by definition the intersection is required to find the conditional probability? Is there an alternative definition/way to compute the conditional probability when you don't know the intersection? I have calculated the conditional probability through intuition many times (E.g. picking Red/Blue marbles out of a bag, without replacement), but I was wondering if there was some sort of standard convention on how calculate the conditional probability when you don't know the intersection? Example. Say we have three people (Alex, Bob, Carol) with their three hats. Say I take all their hats, mix them up, and then return one to each person. What is the probability that person A and B get exactly their own hat back? ""Solution"" : The way I would think of it is: Let $E_A$ and $E_B$ be the events that Alex and Bob get their hats back respectively. Then, $$\mathbb{P}(E_A\cap E_B)= \mathbb{P}(E_B)\times \mathbb{P}(E_A|E_B)$$ The probability of $E_B$ would be $\frac{1}{3}$ . Now, the way I would calculate $\mathbb{P}(E_A|E_B) $ intuitively , even though I don't know what the intersection is (because that's what I'm trying to find), is ""Since Bob has his hat, I have two hats left, which gives a probability of $\frac{1}{2}$ for Alex to get his hat back.""

3553273,"What is exactly spectral expansion, and how is it related to Fourier?","In the theory of automorphic forms, we often refer to the decompositions we write as to ""spectral expansions"". I would like to understand better how this is related to spectral theory of ""relevant"" operators. Let's begin with Fourier analysis on $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ . In that case, the usual Fourier theory states that all (nice enough, say continuous and $C^1$ by parts) function $f$ can be written in the form (I write as usual $e(x) = \exp(2i\pi x)$ . \begin{equation}
f(x) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} f_n e(nx).
\end{equation} However I do not see that particularly through the glasses of spectral theory. Since $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ is a compact spaces, spectral theory essentially ensures that it has discrete spectrum. But here is part of my lack of understanding: of what kind of spectrum are we talking about? I can see that $e(n \cdot)$ is an eigenfunction for certain operators, typically the differentiation or the one-dimensional laplacian. But why do we consider these operators more than any other? In other words: is Fourier analysis inherently of this form (instead of taking other ""good operator"" to use and providing other spectral expansions)? Now, what about Fourier analysis on $\mathbb{R}$ . In that case, we have the Fourier transformation theory, and every good enough (say Schwartz, even if it is a far too strong condition) function $f$ can be written in the form \begin{equation}
f(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \hat{f}(y) e(xy) \mathrm{d}y. 
\end{equation} This is a certain kind of ""continuous"" spectral expansion. Is it exactly a (continuous) spectral expansion (the $e(y\cdot)$ are also eigenfunctions of differential operators) or is that merely an analogy? Is there a formalism to make them both really appear as such? And, as above, is that an intrinsic form of spectral expansion or is it depending on a certain kind of operator we chose to look through? Finally, we arrive at automorphic forms. So we have a certain group $G$ , say $GL_2(\mathbb{R})$ , and we look at functions on it. It is quite a large group, so that we quotient by a maximal compact subgroup $K = O_2(\mathbb{R})$ . Any function $f$ on $G$ can therefore be expanded as \begin{equation}
f(g) = \sum_{m \in \mathbb{Z}} f_m(g),
\end{equation} where $f_m(g)$ satisfies the transformation rule $f_m(g r_\theta ) = e(m\theta) f_m(g)$ for the rotation $r_\theta \in K$ . I think this has a relation with the fact that $K$ is compact and should have discrete spectrum, but I do not see the relation with $f$ : it is not eve,n $K$ -invariant. Is that a kind of generalized spectral expansion, where $f$ can be summed over all the possible "" $K$ -periodic"" functions, i.e. satisfying the above transformation rule? So we have a function on $G$ and we split the study between a function on $G_K$ and a spectral decomposition over $K$ ? Finally, for more general automorphic forms and Maass forms. In that case, we decompose every function that is eigenfunction of the (hyperbolic) laplacian as a sum over the laplacian spectrum. Maybe a slightly different question than what is above but the one that motivated all the others is : Why do we chose the laplacian more than any other differential operator? Is it intrinsic/unique in some sense? Or could we get another theory of automorphic forms using another operator?","['number-theory', 'automorphic-forms', 'spectral-theory']"

If $T(v)$ is invertible, then $T(T^{-1})=(Av)(Av)^{-1}=(\lambda v)(\lambda v)^{-1}=I_n$ .

Quite remarkably, it has been proven that $4$ is the only value of $n$ for which there exists an exotic $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Moreover, it has also been shown that there are uncountably many exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ 's. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_R4 I admit that I do not at all understand the existence proof of an exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ , but it seems to be quite non-constructive. It rests upon the existence of a non-trivial smooth 5 dimensional $h$ -cobordism which must exist by some other theorem. https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.jdg/1214437666 However I had an idea of where these things could be coming from (or at least something interesting if not related to exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ 's). Recall the standard construction of $\mathbb{Q}$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ : on the set $\mathbb{Z}\times(\mathbb{Z}-\{0\})$ we define a relation by $$(a,b)\sim(c,d)\Longleftrightarrow ad=bc$$ Then you show it's an equivalence relation and on the set of equivalence classes, you define addtion, multiplication, show that they're well-defined, etc. However, recall from elementary set theory the definition of a relation: A relation on $X$ is nothing more than a subset of $X\times X$ . So from this perspective, $\mathbb{Q}$ can be identified with a particular subset of $\big(\mathbb{Z}\times(\mathbb{Z}-\{0\})\big)^2\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^4$ . But $\mathbb{Z}^4\subseteq \mathbb{R}^4$ , so that means that $\mathbb{Q}$ is sitting inside of $\mathbb{R}^4$ . Clearly, we already know that $\mathbb{Q}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^4$ by inclusion into any one of the coordinates. However, these are quite different than the $\mathbb{Q}$ coming from the set contruction, which I will call $\tilde{\mathbb{Q}}$ to distingtuish from the ""ordinary"" $\mathbb{Q}$ 's sitting inside $\mathbb{R}^4$ . Of course, $\tilde{\mathbb{Q}}$ has it's natural metric. However, it doesn't coincide with the standard metric as a subset of $\mathbb{R}^4$ .
