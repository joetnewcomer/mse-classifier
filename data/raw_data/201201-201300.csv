3953198,Find curve at the intersection of two level surfaces.,"Let C be the curve at the intersection of two level surfaces M(x, y, z) = 5 and N(x,y,z) = 0, passing through a point P (1,1,1). Let $M(x, y, z) = 2x^2 + y^2 + 2z^2$ and $N(x, y, z) = xy-z$ . Find curve C in the parametric form <x(t), y(t), z(t)>. I am quite stuck on this one. I could let $z = xy$ and then plugging that into M I'd have $2x^2 + y^2 + 2x^2y^2 = 5$ , and I have no idea what would be good ways to parametrize that. Another way is to let $y=z/x$ , in which case I end up with $2x^4 + (2z^2-5)x^2+z^2 = 0$ , but again, I'm quite stuck. Any help would be really appreciated! Or, if it is impossible to find the curve C, the question I'm working on actually asks for the tangent line to curve C at P if x'(0) = 3. If this makes things easier, how exactly is using this tangent more useful?","['multivariable-calculus', 'tangent-line', 'vectors', 'parametric']"
3953216,Positive definite solution to matrix differential equation (dynamical Riccati equation),"I am wondering how I can show that the solution ( $P$ ) to the following matrix differential equation $$\begin{align}
\dot{P}(t) &= -A^{\top}P - PA + PBR^{-1}B^{\top}P - Q \\[3mm]

\end{align}$$ where $$\begin{align}
A = \begin{bmatrix}-4&0\\0&0\end{bmatrix},\quad B = \begin{bmatrix}2\\-2\end{bmatrix},\quad Q = \begin{bmatrix}4&4\\4&4\end{bmatrix},\quad S = \begin{bmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{bmatrix}\quad \text{and}\quad R= \begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix},
\end{align}$$ is positive definite (i.e., $P > 0$ ) without solving the matrix differential equation. Is there some way we can see this, maybe by first rewriting the RHS? What are some useful properties one could use? For those of you unfamiliar with this equation, there actually exists a unique solution $P$ to this equation if $Q$ and $S$ are positive semidefinite and $R$ positive definite, which they all are in case. It is also true that the solution $P$ , in general, is positive semidefinite. I do not have the proof for this, unfortunately.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'optimal-control', 'control-theory', 'matrix-equations', 'positive-definite']"
3953242,"If A is an $m\times n$ matrix, show that $||A||_2 \le \sqrt{||A||_1*||A||_\infty}$","If $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix, show that $$\| A \|_2 \le \sqrt{\|A\|_1 \, \| A \|_\infty}$$ I reduced this to: $$\rho(A^TA) \le||A||1*||A||_\infty$$ I created a matrix for experimenting: $$A = \begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix} \\
A^T = \begin{bmatrix}a&c\\b&d\end{bmatrix} \\
A^tA = \begin{bmatrix}a^2+b^2&ac+bd\\ac+bc&c^2+d^2\end{bmatrix}$$ I tried to calculate the eigenvalues but that got me nowhere. $$-\lambda^2-\lambda(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)+(ad-bc)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow(ad-bc)^2 = \lambda(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)+\lambda^2$$ As for $||A||_1$ it can be either $a+c$ or $b+d$ , and $||A|||_\infty$ can be either $a+b$ or $c+d$ . This gives me 4 possible combinations: $$c^2+cd+a(c+d) \\
a^2+a(b+c)+bc \\
b^2+a(b+d)+db \\
d^2+d(b+c)+bc$$ I suppose I could do: $$\lambda = \frac{(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)\pm \sqrt{(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)^2+4*(ad-bc)^2}}{-2}$$ Since that root will always be bigger than $(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)$ , $\lambda$ will be either negative (because of the -2), in which case it's ""proven"" because the right hand side of the initial equation is always positive, or... it will be so big that the denominator will approach zero from the negative side, when the sign is negative, because you'll have $(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)-((a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)+ something)$ . In that case, the result will be a very small negative value, divided by -2, which is a very small positive value.

3953271,Quotient Stacks and Torsors,"The following definition of a quotient stack $[X/G]$ is taken from Martin Olsson's book ""Algebraic Spaces and Stacks"" Let $X$ be an algebraic space and let $G/S$ be a smooth group scheme which acts on $X$ . Define $[X/G]$ to be the stack whose objects are triples $(T, \mathcal{P}, \pi)$ where: $T$ is an $S$ -schemes, $\mathcal{P}$ is a $G \times_S T$ -torsor on the big 'etale site of $T$ , and $\pi: \mathcal{P} \to X \times_S T$ is a $G \times_S T$ -equivariant morphism of sheaves on $\operatorname{Sch}/T$ . Question: Suppose $Y$ is a moduli stack over $\operatorname{Sch}/\operatorname{Spec}k$ classifying some set of geometric objects $C$ (e.g. curves, sheaves, etc.). Suppose that to each such geometric object classified by $Y$ one may add an extra piece of data, say $\phi$ called a framing, such  that the set of geometric objects+ framings are classified by an algebraic space $X$ over $\operatorname{Spec} k$ . One can then define a morphism $q: X \to Y$ which simply forgets the framing, i.e. $(C, \phi) \mapsto C$ .  Now suppose that the set of framings for each object is a torsor for a smooth group scheme $G$ . Intuitively, this means that the fibers of $q$ should be $G$ -torsors. I am trying to understand how to go from this idea to actually proving that $Y=[X/G]$ . How do I rigorously go about showing that the map $q$ which forgets the framing $\phi$ has fibers $G$ -torsors? How do you conclude from there that $Y=[X/G]$ , for example, do I need to show that $q$ is a essential surjection?","['algebraic-stacks', 'algebraic-geometry', 'category-theory']"

3953334,Relationship between the spectrum of $AA^*$ and $A^*A$,"I'm currently reading something on unbounded operators and their spectra and the author notes that the nonzero spectra of $AA^*$ and $A^*A$ are equal. $A$ here is unbounded and densely defined (on $L^2$ , if that helps), but not self-adjoint. The only other useful point might be that $AA^*$ and $A^*A$ differ by a constant. This for me does not seem to help however; if $\lambda$ belongs to the resolvent of $AA^*$ , i.e. $AA^* - \lambda$ is invertible, and $A^*A = AA^* + c$ where $c \neq 0$ is the constant, then $A^*A - (c + \lambda) = AA^* - \lambda$ is invertible, so $c + \lambda$ belongs to the resolvent of $A^*A$ . But I guess if this was to be a proof I would expect $\lambda \in \sigma(AA^*) \setminus \{0\}$ if and only if $\lambda \in (A^*A) \setminus \{0\}$ ? On the other hand, some finite dimensional tests with real matrices in Mathematica seem to suggest this result is true (i.e. that the eigenvalues of $MM^t$ are equal to the eigenvalues of $M^tM$ , but the eigenvectors are not the same). I can't see why however? Do I need more hypotheses for this to be true? If not can someone provide a hint or proof?

I did this: Because $Aut(G) = \{id\}$ then there is only one way to rearrange all the elements, and by definition of $Aut(G)$ , then $|G| \leq 2$ , because you have to fix the neuter and the other element should be fixed if $|G| = 2$ .

3953398,What is the formal proof that the reciprocal of a number approaches 0 as the number increases without bound?,"In Calculus textbooks it seems assumed that $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0 ,$$ meaning that ""the limit of the reciprocal of $n$ as $n$ increases without bound is zero"". This makes intuitive sense: if $a/b$ gives the (potentially fractional) number of times $b$ fits into $a$ , then as $b$ increases without bound, $a/b$ should get increasingly small. What would be the formal proof that $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0?$$ More generally, this is usually expressed as $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{a}{n} = 0 ,$$ though if $a$ does not contain $n$ it gives the same result, $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{a}{n} = a \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} = a(0) = 0 .$$","['limits', 'calculus']"
3953416,What is a good metric for the distance between two collections of unordered sets of any size?,"There are unordered sets of unfixed length containing independent categorical elements.
(In the real world scenario, elements may possess similarity, but I am ignoring that, for now, to keep the problem simple.) There are unordered collections (sets) of these sets. What is a way I might define the distances between any two of these collections? I prefer distance metrics that fit the normal rules for a valid distance metric. I would like to consider that sets in different collections that are not identical but share some common elements possess some influence to reduce the distance compared to if no elements were the same, otherwise, the distance between such collections would be the same as the distances between the sets. Thoughts:
I have considered matching similar sets to each other and taking an average or total distance between the pairs, plus some distance for any leftover sets if the collections have an uneven number of sets, but I do not like the problems that come from a greedy algorithm and I dislike the computation cost that comes from a more sophisticated pairing.
I realize that comparing every set in collection A with every set in collection B requires some sort of adjustment so that large, but very similar collections do not receive a large distance simply because every possible pair of sets that do not match well add up to a large distance.","['elementary-set-theory', 'metric-spaces']"

My attempt: Suppose that $(C^1[0,1],\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle)$ is Hilbert space. Next, we denote $\Vert \cdot \Vert$ be the norm induced by $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle$ .

3953510,Secret-Santa: Probability of two people drawing each other.,"When playing Secret Santa this year, where a group of $n$ people buy presents and these $n$ presents get randomly distributed to the other people, excluding the possibility of someone getting his or her own present (we did it with a online-distributer, so this possibility really is excluded), someone in this round asked the question about the probabilty of two people giving presents to each other . Since then I've been thinking about this problem, but I didnt get very far. The only thing that comes to my mind is working with the symmetric group $S_{n}$ , and considering the possibilities $S_{n}\setminus F$ , with $F$ being the set of all permuations with at least one fixpoint, as this is not possible in the game of Secret Santa. The probabilty I'm interested in now can be calculated by coming up with the cardinality of the set $\{\pi \in S_{n}\setminus F\ \mid \pi $ contains at least a two-cycle $\}$ . Any futher ideas?","['symmetric-groups', 'combinatorics', 'probability', 'permutation-cycles']"
3953676,Evaluating $\lim_{n\to\infty}( f\left(x_0+\frac 1{n^2}\right)+\dots+ f\left(x_0+\frac n{n^2}\right)-nf(x_0) )$,"I'm doing an exercise in Real Analysis and I would like to have my proof check since I'm not 100% sure of it. The problem says to consider a function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ differentiable at $x_0$ and with $f(x_0)>0$ (which I guess it's useless at this point but the exercise had other points in which it was necessary so I put it anyway). Then, we are asked to evaluate the following $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(f\left(x_0+\frac 1{n^2}\right)+\dots+ f\left(x_0+\frac n{n^2}\right)-nf(x_0)\right).$$ Here is how I would do it: $f$ is differentiable and hence continuous at $x_0$ ; We apply Taylor's Theorem at $x_0$ , so that there is a neighborhood of $x_0$ , $I=(x_0-\delta,x_0+\delta)$ , and a function $h$ such that, for all $x\in I$ , $$f(x)=f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0)+h(x)(x-x_0)$$ and $h(x)\rightarrow 0$ as $x\rightarrow x_0$ . Now, if $n>\frac 1{\delta}$ then each of the $n$ points $x_0+\frac 1{n^2},\dots,x_0+\frac 1n$ are in $I$ so we can apply the previous point to get $$f\left(x_0+\frac k{n^2}\right)=f(x_0)+f'(x_0)\frac k{n^2}+h\left(x_0+\frac k{n^2}\right)\frac k{n^2}.$$ Summing from $k=1$ to $k=n$ we get $$f\left(x_0+\frac 1{n^2}\right)+\dots+ f\left(x_0+\frac n{n^2}\right)=nf(x_0)+\frac {f'(x_0)}{n^2}(1+\dots+n)+\frac 1{n^2}\left(h\left(x_0+\frac 1{n^2}\right)+\dots+nh\left(x_0+\frac 1n\right)\right)$$ Using the fact that $1+\dots+n=\frac {n(n+1)}2$ our original expression simplifies to $$f\left(x_0+\frac 1{n^2}\right)+\dots+ f\left(x_0+\frac n{n^2}\right)-nf(x_0)=\frac {f'(x_0)}{n^2}\frac {n(n+1)}2+\frac 1{n^2}\left(h\left(x_0+\frac 1{n^2}\right)+\dots+nh\left(x_0+\frac 1n\right)\right).$$ Fix $\epsilon>0$ , since $\frac {n(n+1)}{2n^2}\rightarrow \frac 12$ there is an $\bar{n}$ such that $n\geq \bar{n}$ implies that $\left|\frac {n(n+1)}{2n^2}-\frac 12\right|<\epsilon$ . On the other hand, there is a $\delta'$ such that $|h(x)|<\epsilon$ on $(x_0-\delta',x_0+\delta')$ . Since $x_0+\frac k{n^2}\rightarrow x_0$ and $\frac k{n^2}\leq \frac 1n$ we have that for $n>\frac 1{\delta'}$ $$\left|h\left(x_0+\frac k{n^2}\right)\right|<\epsilon.$$ By picking $n\geq\max\left\{\frac 1{\delta},\bar{n},\frac 1{\delta'}\right\}$ we obtain that $$\left|\frac {f'(x_0)}{n^2}\frac {n(n+1)}2+\frac 1{n^2}\left(h\left(x_0+\frac 1{n^2}\right)+\dots+nh\left(x_0+\frac 1n\right)\right)-\frac {f'(x_0)}2\right|\leq$$ $$f'(x_0)\left|\frac {n(n+1)}{2n^2}-\frac 12\right|+\frac 1{n^2}\left|h\left(x_0+\frac 1{n^2}\right)+\dots+nh\left(x_0+\frac 1n\right)\right|<$$ $$f'(x_0)\epsilon+\frac 1{n^2}\left|h\left(x_0+\frac 1{n^2}\right)\right|+\dots+\frac n{n^2}\left|h\left(x_0+\frac 1n\right)\right|<f'(x_0)\epsilon+\epsilon(1+\dots+n)=$$ $$=f'(x_0)\epsilon+\frac {\epsilon}{n^2}\frac {n(n+1)}2<f'(x_0)\epsilon+\epsilon\left(\frac 12+\epsilon\right).$$ Since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, we can conclude that $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(f\left(x_0+\frac 1{n^2}\right)+\dots+ f\left(x_0+\frac n{n^2}\right)-nf(x_0)\right) = \frac {f'(x_0)}2.$$ Is my proof correct?

3953740,Help with the gradient in different co-ordinate systems,"Let $L(x,y)$ be the linear Taylor series expansion of some function $f(x,y)$ . This can be written as $$L(x,y)=f(x_0,y_0)+f_x(x-x_0)+f_y(y-y_0)$$ Or in more compact form as $$L(x,y)=f(x_0,y_0)+\nabla f ^T \vec{p}$$ where $$
\vec{p}=
\begin{bmatrix}
x-x_0\\
y-y_0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$ and $$\nabla f(x,y)=f_x \vec{i}+f_y\vec{j}$$ Now, we find out that $x'= \alpha_1 x$ and $y'= \alpha_2 y$ , which is the linear transformation $A$ of the original co-ordinates and we want to find the Taylor series expansion in terms of $x' \text{ and } y'$ , i.e. the new co-ordinate system. Writing the composite function $$g(x',y')=f(x(x'),y(x'))$$ $$L(x',y')=g(x'_0,y'_0)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial x'}(x'-x'_0)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial y'}(y'-y'_0)$$ $\implies$ . $$L(x',y')=f(x_0,y_0)+\frac{1}{\alpha_1}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x'-x'_0)+\frac{1}{\alpha_2}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(y'-y'_0)$$ $\implies$ $$L(x',y')=f(x_0,y_0)+\vec{p}'^TA^{-T}\nabla f(x_0,y_0)$$ This function is describing exactly the same function but in the new stretched Cartesian co-ordinate system. By inspection the gradient in terms of the new co-ordinate system is $$\nabla g(x_0',y_0') = A^{-T}\nabla f(x_0,y_0)=g_{x'} \vec{i}'+g_{y'} \vec{j}'= \frac{1}{\alpha_1}f_x \vec{i}' + \frac{1}{\alpha_2}f_y \vec{j}'$$ Now because the Cartesian co-ordinate system has been stretched the basis vectors have changed, such that now $$\vec{i}'=\frac{\vec{i}}{\alpha_1}$$ and $$\vec{j}'=\frac{\vec{j}}{\alpha_2}$$ Substitution of these into $\nabla g(x_0',y_0')$ reveals that $$\nabla g(x_0',y_0')= \frac{1}{\alpha_1^2}f_x \vec{i} + \frac{1}{\alpha_2^2}f_y \vec{j}$$ which is different to the direction in the standard Cartesian co-ordinate system. On my travels to understand this I discovered Pavel Grinfeld's video series on Tensor algebra, where he shows that to make the gradient invariant under transformation I should use the definition $$\nabla f(x,y)=\frac{f_x}{\vec{i}\cdot\vec{i}}\vec{i}+\frac{f_x}{\vec{j}\cdot\vec{j}}\vec{j}$$ My background is in EEE, and frequently use steepest decent to solve numeric problems, I had never considered the transformation until I looked into conditioning the problem. I'm having a hard time understanding why the gradient derived from the transformed system is different to the original one in the first place. If anyone can shed any light on using the basis vectors $\frac{\vec{i}}{\vec{i}\cdot\vec{i}}$ and $\frac{\vec{j}}{\vec{j}\cdot\vec{j}}$ I would be very grateful. There seems to be a contradiction in here, or a subtle detail I a missing. I have seen several posts of people just saying the gradient is variant under transformation and to use the direction in the transformed co-ordinate system. My issue is, there shouldn't be any variation in the gradient, as per the geometric definition, it points in the direction of greatest increase and this doesn't change simply because co-ordinates are transformed. Example $$f(x,y)=2x+2y$$ $$\nabla f(x,y)=2\vec{i}+2\vec{j}$$ let $x'=2x$ and $y'=2y$ $$g(x',y')=x'+y'$$ $$\nabla g(x',y')=1\vec{i'}+1\vec{j'}$$ $\vec{i}=2 \vec{i}'$ and $\vec{j}=2 \vec{j}'$ and so this gradient in terms of the old basis vectors but in the new co-ordinate system is $$\nabla g(x',y')=0.5\vec{i}+0.5\vec{j}$$ so $\nabla g(x',y') \neq \nabla f(x,x) $ but $g(x',y') = f(x(x'),y(y')) $ [Gradient in two co-ordinate systems][1] I don't understand how the following would help, can anyone help me consolidate this? $$\nabla g(x',y')=\frac{1\vec{i'}}{\vec{i'} \cdot \vec{i'}}+\frac{1\vec{j'}}{\vec{j'} \cdot \vec{j'}}$$ [1]: https://i.sstatic.net/PArGk.png EDIT: Just to add, I found this thread on the same subject Definition of the gradient for non-Cartesian coordinates . They define the gradient geometrically as the directional derivative in the unit direction of steepest ascent, dotted with the unit direction of steepest ascent. That is: $$\nabla f = d(\vec{v}_{max})\vec{v}_{max}$$ Why am I getting two different gradients in two different co-ordinate systems? Why do these: http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt-S15/scribes/14-newton-scribed.pdf lecture notes describe the gradient decent method as affine variant? I understand that the sensitivities will be different because different co-ordinate systems are used, but the basis vectors should compensate for this such that the gradient points in the same direction regardless of the system used.","['multivariable-calculus', 'tensors', 'vector-analysis']"

region to region using crossing rule to add or subtract one at each

then it probably is a duck"" We have the 3 probabilities: $P(\text{look}) = 80\%$ $P(\text{swim}) = 70\%$ $P(\text{quack}) = 90\%$ I would assume then that $P(\text{duck}) = P(\text{look})·P(\text{swim})·P(\text{quack})$ $= 0.8 · 0.7 · 0.9$ $= 0.504$ This is obviously dead wrong. Common sense expects the resulted probability close to $1$ . What would be right operation among the individual probabilities to represent the original saying correctly? Update: Giving some context: We have a problem in an industrial environment, where we have to validate if our calculated values are true or not. We can conduct a few independent measurements, each addresses a different aspect of the same setup and each measurment returns a yes or no with a probability. Then we have to summarize them and compare to the theoretical calculations. What we do is duck typing. Update 2: While reading up the answers did hit me: the more independent measurement events we do on properties of the duck, should prove or disprove the ""duckness"" of the object.
Should we have 6 independent measurements (look, swim, quack, fly, eat, walk), each around probability of 0.1, our calculation should conclude that this is certainly not a duck. Should we get confirming measurements (higher than 0.5), I expect higher ""duckness"" probability.","['statistical-inference', 'statistics', 'probability']"

3954418,Expected number of coin tosses until $HH$ in a row,"I was asked the following problem: Given a coin with $\displaystyle P( H) =p,\ P( T) =1-p$ , what is the expected number of tosses until we receive two $\displaystyle H$ in a row? I may use the fact that the expected number of tosses until the first $\displaystyle H$ is $\displaystyle \frac{1}{p}$ . My solution: Let's denote $\displaystyle X_{2} =number\ of\ tosses\ until\ HH\ ( including\ the\ HH)$ . We want to find $\displaystyle E[ X_{2}]$ . At the same time, let's denote $\displaystyle X_{1} =number\ of\ tosses\ until\ H\ ( including\ H)$ . From the given we know that $\displaystyle E[ X_{1}] =\frac{1}{p}$ . Let's now try to simplify the expression $\displaystyle E[ X_{2}]$ with the Law of Total Probability. Let's denote two events: $\displaystyle A=after\ the\ 1^{st} \ H\ appears,\ the\ next\ toss\ is\ an\ H$ . $\displaystyle A^{c} =after\ the\ 1^{st} \ H\ appears,\ the\ next\ toss\ is\ a\ T$ . Let's also assume that the number of tosses until the first $\displaystyle H$ is some number $\displaystyle r$ . Since every toss is independent from each other, we know that $\displaystyle P( A) =P( H) =p$ . At the same, from the same reason, we will get $\displaystyle P\left( A^{c}\right) =P( T) =1-p$ . From the \ Law of Total Probability then, we can define: $\displaystyle E[ X_{2}] =P( A) \cdotp E[ X|A] +P\left( A^{c}\right) \cdotp E\left[ X|A^{c}\right]$ . $\displaystyle =p\cdotp E[ X|A] +( 1-p) \cdotp E\left[ X|A^{c}\right]$ . But, • $\displaystyle E[ X|A]$ = the expected number of tosses until the first HH, if we know that we had exactly $\displaystyle r$ tosses until the first $\displaystyle H$ , and after that we had an $\displaystyle H$ . Basically, this means we received $\displaystyle HH$ consecutively for the first time! So we will stop tossing here. The number of tosses, in this case, will be is $\displaystyle r+1$ . We know the expected value of $\displaystyle r$ is $\displaystyle E[ X_{1}] =\frac{1}{p}$ . So: $\displaystyle E[ X|A] =\frac{1}{p} +1$ . • $\displaystyle E\left[ X|A^{c}\right]$ = the expected number of tosses, if we know that we had exaclty $\displaystyle r$ tosses until the first $\displaystyle H$ , and after that we had a $\displaystyle T$ . Also, in this case, we tossed the coin $\displaystyle r+1$ times, but we won't be stopping, since we didn't achieve the $\displaystyle HH$ consecutively. The opposite, we are left facing the same problem recursively. Each toss is independent from the previous one, so after the $\displaystyle r+1$ , we have to ""start over"", and have again $\displaystyle E[ X_{2}]$ expected tosses. So: $\displaystyle E\left[ X|A^{c}\right] =\frac{1}{p} +1+E[ X_{2}]$ . Overall plugging into our initial equation we get: $\displaystyle  \begin{array}{{>{\displaystyle}l}}
E[ X_{2}] =p\cdotp \left(\frac{1}{p} +1\right) +( 1-p) \cdotp \left(\frac{1}{p} +1+E[ X_{2}]\right)\\
=1+p+\frac{1}{p} +1+E[ X_{2}] -1-p\cdotp E[ X_{2}]\\
\Rightarrow \\
p\cdotp E[ X_{2}] =\frac{1}{p} +1\\
\Rightarrow \\
E[ X_{2}] =\frac{1+p}{p^{2}} .
\end{array}$ I'm confident this solution is correct, by looking at this other question: Expected value of number of trials to get k SUCCESSIVE successes . I basically plugged in my numbers into their solution. Despite this, they used a different method it seems in the first passage, which I don't really understand where it's derived. At the same time, I feel like my answers use a lot of words especially for the cases of $\displaystyle E[ X|A] ,\ E\left[ X|A^{c}\right]$ . I hoped to have some formula to use instead of having to explain the solution ""logically"". Any advice?","['expected-value', 'probability']"

3954520,An unbounded sequence s.t. $\forall t>0 |[a_nt]-a_nt|\rightarrow 0$,"While studying probability I accidentally proved the result below by what I think is an overly complicated proof (a sketch of this proof below). Is there an easy way to prove it? The result is the following. Let $\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence over the reals such that for all $t>0$ we have $\lim_{n} |[a_nt]-a_nt|=0$ , where we denote with $[x]$ the nearest integer to x. Then $\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges to $0$ . This is equivalent to another result. Let $\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence over the reals and $a$ a real number such that for all $t>0$ we have $\lim_{n} \text{e}^{\text{i}a_nt}=e^{\text{i}at}$ Then $\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges. Proof. Let us suppose that $\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ doesn't converge. We will study two possible scenarios, both leading to contradiction. First case. The sequence $\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is bounded.
Then, choosing a small enough $t$ , we get that $\forall n |a_nt|<\pi$ , and we conclude, using the continuity of the complex logarithm, that the sequence converges to $a+2k\pi$ for some $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ . Second case. The sequence $\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is unbounded. Then, we consider a sequence $\{X_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of random variables such that $\forall n X_n\sim N(a_n,1)$ and their respective characteristic functions $\{\text{exp}(\text{i}a_nt-t^2/2)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ . Our initial assumptions imply that the sequence of characteristic functions is pointwise convergent to $\text{exp}(\text{i}at-t^2/2)$ , so, by Paul-Levy's theorem, the sequence of random variables $\{X_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges in distribution to a random variable $X$ such that $X\sim N(a,1)$ . However, it can be proved via Chebishev inequality that if the sequence of numbers $\{a_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is unbounded then the sequence of random variables doesn't converge in distribution to any random variable.","['real-numbers', 'elementary-number-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability-theory', 'complex-numbers']"

3954659,Determining how a Markov transition function move from one state to the next,"If $(X, \mathcal{F})$ is a measure space, we may define a Markov transition function $P: X \times \mathcal{F} \to \mathbb{R}$ as a function such that if $x$ is fixed, $P(x, A)$ is a probability measure on $\mathcal{G},$ and if $A$ is fixed, then $P(x,A)$ is a measurable function of $x.$ However, the definition does not say anything about how we move from one state to the next, so I'm trying to figure that out. My 1st guess: If $A$ is fixed, then starting at $x_0$ we move to $P(x_0, A),$ then $P(P(x_0,A), A)$ and so on. This is clearly deterministic and does not explain the case $X \ne \mathbb{R},$ so it's wrong. My 2nd guess: Instead, $P(x_0, A)$ represents the probability $x_0$ moves to a point in $A.$ However, how do we know that just by defining $P,$ the function doesn't contradict itself? If we have $X = \mathbb{R}$ and somehow arrive at $P(0, [-1,0]) = 1/5, P(0, [1,2]) = 2/5, P(0, [-1,0] \cup [1,2]) = 4/5,$ then $P$ is clearly inconsistent. If $P(x_0, \cdot)$ is $\sigma$ -additive as a function $\mathcal{F} \to \mathbb{R},$ then we can guarantee consistency, and the probabilities actually mean something. Luckily, this is implied by the italicized part of the definition. But how about actually calculating where $x_0$ goes? If $X = \mathbb{R},$ we should have some way of calculating a probability distribution. What would the distribution be in terms of $P$ ? Certainly, if $F_n(x)$ is the distribution that is $P(x, [i/n, (i+1)/n])$ on $[i/n, (i+1)/n]$ for all $i \in \mathbb{Z},$ then $F(x) = \lim\limits_n F_n(x),$ is the distribution we seek. But there has to be a simpler way, right? I thought of these issues while solving the problem below. It is easy, but I suspect if someone hands me a more complicated distribution in the future and asks me to calculate a different probability, I would be hard pressed to jump through the hoops I did in my solution. Consider  a  Markov  chain  whose  state  space  is $\mathbb{R}.$ Let $P(x,A), x \in \mathbb{R} ,A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}),$ be the following Markov transition function, $$P(x,A) =\lambda([x−1/2,x+ 1/2]\cap A),$$ where $\lambda$ is  the  Lebesgue  measure.  Assuming  that  the  initial  distribution  is concentrated at the origin, find $P(|\omega_2| \le 1/4).$ Solution: $P$ clearly models $x$ moving to a point selected from $[x-\frac{1}{2}, x+\frac{1}{2}]$ uniformly at random. Thus, the distribution of $\omega_1$ is a uniform distribution on $[-1/2, 1/2],$ and the probability $|\omega_2| \le 1/4$ is $\int_{-1/2}^{1/2} P(|w_2| \le 1/4 | w_1 = x) \, dx = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \lambda([x-0.5, x+0.5] \cap [-1/4, 1/4]) \, dx = 2(\int_0^{1/4} \frac{1}{2} \, dx + \int_{1/4}^{1/2} \frac{3}{4} - x \, dx) = 2(\frac{1}{8} + \frac{3}{32}) = 7/16.$ My solution relies on recognizing that $P$ is much simpler than it sounds. But what if it's impossible to interpret $P$ and you're just given a bizarre expression?

Now it is given that all the Sylow p subgroups are normal so unique.
My attempt:
I have uniquely one Sylow 11 subgroup of order 11 which is isomorphic to $Z11$ say $P_1$ , similarly I have uniquely one Sylow 7 subgroup which is isomorphic to $Z_7$ say $P_2$ , now say $P_1=<x>$ and $P_2=<y>$ now the order of $(xy)$ is $7,11 or 77$ , since there are uniquely one Sylow 7 and 11 subgroups so $|xy|=77$ otherwise $<xy>$ will be a group of order 7 or 11 otherthan $P_1$ and $P_2$ .
So, suppose $<xy>= P_3$ where $P_3$ is isomophic to $Z77$ . Now say $h$ is a generator of $P_3$ and $k$ is a generator of the unique Sylow 3 subgroup say $P_4$ , so, $P_4=<k>$ and $P_3=<h>$ where $|h|=77 , |k|=3$ , so now the $|hk|= 3,77 or 231$ , it can't be 3 because there is uniquely one subgroup of order 3 otherwise $<hk>$ will be a group of order 3 otherthan $P_4$ . Now $|hk|= 77 or 231$ , now if $|hk|=231$ then we are done because we have found a generator of this group so G is cyclic.
Now my question is if $|hk|=77$ can we get a contradiction or it is possible so in that case the G is not cyclic, then what is the examples of these type of groups.
Now does the generalisation hold? $|G|=P_1*P_2*....*P_n$ where all $P_i$ 's are primes and all Sylow $P_i$ subgroups are normal then is the group G cyclic? If not then give example.","['normal-subgroups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'sylow-theory']"

(when $0\le k \le n$ ) This is not obvious to me: at first glance, it seems that the expression $n?/(k? (n-k)?)$ contains $n$ binomial coefficients in both numerator and denominator so we could multiply by $(s!)^n$ and receive $$\frac{(n(n-1)...(n-s+1)) \cdot ( (n-1) (n-2) ... (n-s) ) \cdot (...) }{(k(k-1)...(k-s+1)) \cdot ((k-1) (k-2) ... (k-s)) \cdot (...)} = \frac{n! (n-1)! ... (n-s+1)!}{k! (k-1)! ... (k-s+1)! \cdot (n-k)!

But it is not equal to $\binom{n}{k}_?$ , for example, when $s = 2, n = 5, k=3$ , $\binom{5}{3}_? = \frac{\binom{5}{2} \binom{4}{2}}{\binom{2}{2}} = 60$ but $\frac{5!4!}{3!2! \cdot 2! 1!} = 120$ . It is strange, because I don't see the error. If I'm not mistaken, it comes from the fact that $n? = 1$ when $n< s$ . Indeed, when we write $\binom{n}{k}_?= \frac{[n][n-1]...[n-k+1]}{[k][k-1]...[s]}$ and $n-k+1 \ge s$ we get that the fraction above should be divided by $(s!)^{k-(k-s+1)}=(s!)^{s-1}$ . (which is the missing $(2!)^{2-1}=2$ for $s=2, n=5, k=3$ ) But if that fraction gets divided by $(s!)^{something} $ , I do not see how to prove that these numbers are integers.

 &= \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} p(\bar{x}-\eta)p(\eta) \|r_{\sigma}(\bar{x}) - \bar{x} + \eta  \|^2_2  \; d\eta d\bar{x} \\

\end{align*}
$$ We minimize this equation by differentiating it with respect to $r_{\sigma}(\bar{x})$ and setting it equal to $0$ . Let $r_\sigma^*(\bar{x})$ denote the the minimum: $$
\begin{align*}
0 &= \mathbb{E}_{\eta } \left[ p(\bar{x}-\eta) \left(r_\sigma^*(\bar{x}) - \bar{x} + \eta \right) \right] \quad(2)
\end{align*} \\
...
$$ My problem is the step between (1) and (2).
Although it looks correct, I failed to do this step more formally.
Any help is much appreciated! It is the first part of the proof 6.1 from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.4246.pdf Edit Thanks to Milo Brandt's answer I now understand why the integral vanishes. However I am very unsure about the correctness of the  following steps: Lets fix $\bar{x}$ and try to find a $r$ which minimizes $\mathbb{E}_{\eta} \left[ p(\bar{x}-\eta) \left\|r_{\sigma}(\bar{x}) - \bar{x} + \eta \right \|^2_2 \right] $ for this arbitrary $\bar{x}$ . To do so we take the derivativ with respect $r$ and get the minima $r^*$ by setting it to 0. $$
\begin{align}
0=&\frac{d}{dr}  \mathbb{E}_{\eta} \left[ p(\bar{x}-\eta) \left\|r_{\sigma}^*(\bar{x}) - \bar{x} + \eta \right \|^2_2 \right] \qquad (3) \\
0= &  \mathbb{E}_{\eta} \left[ \frac{d}{dr}  p(\bar{x}-\eta) \left\|r_{\sigma}^*(\bar{x}) - \bar{x} + \eta \right \|^2_2 \right] \qquad (4)\\
0 &= \mathbb{E}_{\eta } \left[ p(\bar{x}-\eta) \left(r_\sigma^*(\bar{x}) - \bar{x} + \eta \right) \right] \quad(4)
\end{align}

3955639,Rigorous graduate probability textbook for self-study.,"I have checked several answers that request graduate-level probability theory textbooks, but I have wanted to receive advice that fits my particular needs. My background is in mathematics and I am currently pursuing Ph.D. degree in statistics, but I am still more geared toward mathematics. In my first-year Ph.D. course for probability theory, we used Durrett's Probability Theory and Examples , but I found that the book is too terse for a first reading. I had no problem reading Terrace Tao's Introduction to Measure Theory and Folland's Real Analysis in my real analysis course, but the proofs in Durrett's book were often incomplete and most of the exercises were too hard to solve for someone who is studying the topic for the first time. Therefore, I am planning to use another textbook to supplement Durrett's, and I wanted to ask you advice on which books would be the best choice for me I wish the book is suitable for self-study, that is, it should have rather complete proofs to show each step especially in the earlier chapters. Since I have background in mathematics, I am looking for a book that is still rigorous so that it does not omit significant amount of proofs. Some of the alternatives I have found are Erhan Çinlar's Probability and Stochastics and Shiryaev's Probability 1, 2 . I have asked to my professor about the textbook and it seems like he approves of it, but I wanted to see other options as well. I would love to hear your recommendations and your rationales behind recommending the books.
