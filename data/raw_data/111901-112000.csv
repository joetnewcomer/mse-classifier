1617819,Can every filtration be written as $\mathcal F^X$ for some process $X$,"Given a stochastic process $\{X_t: t\in R^+\}$, which takes value in $R$, there is always a natural filtration $(\mathcal F^X_t)$ induced by $X_t$, i.e. $\mathcal F_t^X = \sigma(\{X_s^{-1}(A): s\le t, A \text{ is Borel-measurable}\})$. Now, consider the inverse situation: Given a filtration $(\Omega, \mathcal F_t)$, (we may consider the special case: $\Omega = R^{R^+}$ first) is it true that there is always a stochastic process $(X_t)$ which is adapted to $\mathcal F_t$, and that $\mathcal F_t = \mathcal F^X_t$ for all $t\in R^+$?

1617876,A construction with ruler and rusty compass,"In the book Geometry: Euclid and beyond , the exercise 2.20 says: Using a ruler and rusty compass, given a line $l$ and given a segment $AB$ more than one inch long, construct one of the points $C$ which the circle of center $A$ and radius $AB$ meets $l$.(Rusty compass's radius is 1 inch) But I don't think it can be done use ruler and rusty compass. As the picture below shown, we need to get point $C$, use ruler and rusty compass, we can easily twice long $BA$ to point $B'$ and construct perpendicular $BG,B'H$, but in order to get length of $GC$, we need to solve a quadratic equation and need to use square root operation, but some results before said that we can only get the length in $\mathbf{Q}$ use ruler and rusty compass.

  $$\text{if } A\subset E \text{ is measurable and } m(A) < \delta, \text{ then } \int_A |f| < \epsilon. \tag{*}$$ Royden's proof: We assume that $f \geq 0$ on $E$ and that $f$ is integrable over $E$.
Then by additivity over domains of integration and Chebyshev's Inequality,
if $A\subset E$ is measurable and $c > 0$,
then
$$ \int_A f = \int_{\{x\in A\, \mid\, f(x) < c\} } f
           + \int_{\{x\in A\, \mid\, f(x) \geq c\} } f
\leq c \cdot m(A) + \frac{1}{c} \int_E f. \tag{1}$$ Choose $c >0$ such that $1/c \cdot \int_E f < \epsilon /2$.
Then $$\int_A f < c \cdot m(A) + \epsilon /2. $$
Define $\delta = \epsilon / 2c$. Then (*) holds for this choice of $\delta$. I'm having trouble working out this last inequality.
So I have
$$\int_{\{x\in A\, \mid\, f(x) < c\} } f
= \int_A f \cdot \chi_{\{x\in A\, \mid\, f(x) < c\} } < \int_A c = c \cdot m(A),$$

$$\int_{\{x\in A\, \mid\, f(x) \geq c\} } f \leq \frac{1}{c} \int_E f,$$

$$\int_A \chi_{\{x\in A: f(x) \geq c\}} = m\{x\in A: f(x) \geq c\} \leq \frac{1}{c} \int_A f $$

1619509,Does $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k!}{k^k}$ converge?,"I have tried using ratio test:
$$P =\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\left|\frac{(k+1)!}{(k+1)^{k+1}}\cdot\frac{k^k}{k!}\right|$$

$$ P=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\left|\frac{k^{k+1}+ k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}\right|$$ In the final expression, the highest degrees in the denominator and numerator are both $(k+1)$. So according to the L'Hospital's Rule, the limit would goes to $1$. $$P=1$$ Thus the test failed.

1619574,Circular definition in proof,"I am confused by the following exercise in Velleman's How To Prove It: 'Suppose $m$ and $n$ are integers. If $mn$ is even, then either $m$ is even or $n$ is even. Proof: Suppose $mn$ is even. Then we can choose an integer $k$ such that $mn=2k$. If $m$ is even then there is nothing more to prove, so suppose $m$ is odd. Then $m=2j+1$ for some integer $j$. Substituting this into the equation $mn=2k$, we get $(2j+1)n=2k$, so $2jn+n=2k$, and therefore $n=2k-2jn=2(k-jn)$. To prove $n$ is even it suffices to find an integer $c$ such that $n=2c$, from the above $c=k-jn$ works. Since $k-jn$ is an integer, it follows that $n$ is even.' There are two things I don't understand: 1) How could $n=2(k-jn)$ be legitimate? Isn't that circular? Surely if he is to solve for n all n must be on one side of the equation? 2) I am not quite sure what he did. It seems that he split them into two cases to exhaust the possibilities of m. If one can prove exhaustively that the conclusion necessarily happens, the proof is correct. But in terms of the entire equation that doesn't seem exhaustive to me, i.e. what about $n$? Also, I understand that by existential instantiation the definition of an even number $$\exists x(m=2x) $$ leads to m=2k, and the same goes with m=2j+1.But why is it suffice to find an integer c such that n=2c? Is he going to use existential generalization to make n=2c into $$ \exists x(n=2x) $$ i.e. the definition of even number, to complete a direct proof? But this is not explicit in the proof. I am trying to self-study this and my maths is, needless to say, dire. So I really appreciate any help on this, thank you so much!","['proof-explanation', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1619632,meaning of the notation f'(-x),"What does $f'(-x)$ essentially mean? $\frac{df(-x)}{dx}$, or $\frac{df(x)}{d(-x)}$, or $\frac{df(x)}{dx}|_{x=-x}$ ? I am not sure if all the options are different, though! :) EDIT 1: Let me explain what I mean by all the options given. In all the cases, $f(x)$ is the original function, say $f(x)=x^3+2x$. Please note that many parts of the explanation are obvious, still I have mentioned them just to avoid any confusion. $\frac{df(-x)}{dx}$   : First we put $-x$ in place of $x$ in $f(x)$ to get $f(-x)=-x^3-2x$. Then we differentiate $f(-x)$ w.r.t $x$ and we get $-3x^2-2$ $\frac{df(x)}{d(-x)}$ : This means differentiating $f(x)$ w.r.t. $-x$, so applying the chain rule we get the value as $\frac{df(x)}{dx} \times \frac{dx}{dz} = (3x^2+2) \times (-1) = -3x^2-2$, where $z=-x$ and hence $\frac{dx}{dz}=-1$. $\frac{df(x)}{dx}|_{x=-x}$ : First we differentiate $f(x)$ w.r.t $x$ and in the derivative we put $-x$ in place of $x$ to obtain the result $3x^2+2$. Another option may be added, though it is not a strong candidate in this case. $\frac{df(-x)}{d(-x)}$ : Which means differentiating $f(-x)$ with respect to $-x$, and we get the result $3x^2+2$. Now I present a context where $f'(-x)$ is relevant. It's basically the question: Show that the derivative of an odd function is even (or vice-versa). The question is discussed here , here and at many other places. In all the answers, to prove the statement, it is shown that $f'(-x)=-f'(x)$. From the question what I interpret is that we have to show $\frac{df(x)}{dx}|_{x=-x} = \frac{df(x)}{dx}$ or in another notation, $f'(x)|_{x=-x} = f'(x)$. While the solutions seem to involve differentiation with respect to $-x$, thus, in my opinion, do not actually prove the statement at hand. Note: I have changed the title slightly to reflect my question more accurately. EDIT 2: David K's vivid explanation cleared my doubt. Here are the conclusions I have come to regarding the notations of concern: (please let me know if there is any flaw) (i) $f'(g(t))=f'(u)|_{u=g(t)}=\frac{d}{dz}(f(z))|_{z=g(t)}=\lim\limits_{h\to 0} \frac{f(g(t)+h)-f(g(t))}{h}$ [where $h$ is a small change in $g(t)$], hence $f'(x)$ does not necessarily mean that we have to find $f'$ by differentiating $f$ with respect to $x$. It just means that represent $f$ in the form of any 'dummy' variable (say $v$), differentiate it w.r.t. $v$ to get $f'$ and substitute $x$ for $v$ in $f'$ to get $f'(x)$. (ii) $f'(-x)=\frac{d}{d(-x)}(f(-x))=\frac{d}{dx}(f(x))|_{x=-x}$, hence option 3 and option 4 in my question are actually same and both are correct answer to my original question.","['derivatives', 'functions']"
1619656,Possible subbundles on $\mathbb{CP}^1$,"I have the vector bundle $E:= \mathcal{O}(1)^{\oplus k}$ on the projective line, $\mathbb{CP}^1$. I want to know what are the possible subbundles of this, and why? We know that the Birkhoff-Grothendieck Theorem says that any bundle on $\mathbb{P}^1$ must be a direct sum of line bundles. So any subbundle of $E$ must look like $\oplus_i^r \mathcal{O}(a_i) $ (where $r\leq k$). So what are the constraints on the $a_i$? Naively, I'd like to say that the $a_i$ just have to be 1 to match the decomposition of $E$, but I don't think this is true. And the same question, but more general would be what are the subbundles of $\oplus_i^k \mathcal{O}(b_i) $. This would probably be more useful to more people.","['projective-space', 'vector-bundles', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

1619699,"Does there exists a function $f$ such that for some prime $p_1$, $p_{n+1}=f(p_n)$ gives a sequence of primes?","It occurs to me that it would be very cool if for a prime $p_1$ we have $p_{2}=2^{p_1}-1$ prime, and then $p_3 = 2^{p_2}-1$ prime, and so on. This would be a sort of infinite sequence of Mersenne primes. I know this particular case isn't known, as it isn't known if there are an infinite number of Mersenne primes to begin with. So my question is as in the title. Does there exists a function $f$ such that for some prime $p_1$, $p_{n+1}=f(p_n)$ gives a sequence of primes? Either $f$ must grow incredibly fast, as otherwise that'd make computing large primes easy, or perhaps there is an $f$ and merely the existence of some $p_1$ proven. Both of these possibilities seem plausible to me, so I'm wondering if there is a result like this. Preferably $f: N \to N$ as some sort of expression in $Z[t]$ with exponentials, but if there are none, what about something more algorithmic such as computing gcd's or largest factors? I.e., prime in, prime out. I mean, obviously there is an algorithm for computing primes in sequence, but I'm thinking some more clean.","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"
1619702,Degree two homogeneous differentiable function is a quadratic form.,"Let $f: \Bbb R^n \to \Bbb R^k$ be a ${\cal C}^2$ function such that $f(tx) = t^2f(x)$ for all $t \in \Bbb R$ and all $x \in \Bbb R^n$. Then there is a bilinear map $B: \Bbb R^n \times \Bbb R^n\to \Bbb R^k$ such that $f(x) = B(x,x)$, for all $x \in \Bbb R^n$. Here's some progress. Using some reverse engineering, we can say what $B$ must be. If $\Delta$ is the diagonal inclusion, differentiating $f = B \circ \Delta$ at $x$ and evaluating at $y$ gives $B(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}{\rm d}f(x)(y)$. Then we're only left with proving that $B$ defined by that expression is linear in the first variable. We know that the maps $$\begin{matrix} \Bbb R \times \Bbb R^n & \stackrel{q \times f}{\longrightarrow} & \Bbb R \times \Bbb R^k &  \stackrel{m}{\longrightarrow} & \Bbb R^k \\ (t,x) & \mapsto & (t^2,f(x)) & \mapsto & t^2f(x)\end{matrix} \quad \text{ and }\quad \begin{matrix} \Bbb R \times \Bbb R^n & \stackrel{m}{\longrightarrow} & \Bbb R^n  & \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} & \Bbb R^k \\ (t,x) & \mapsto & tx & \mapsto & f(tx)\end{matrix}  $$are equal (yes, I'm abusing notation using $m$ twice). Differentiating $m \circ (q \times f) = f \circ m$ at $(t,x)$ gives: $${\rm d}m(t^2,f(x))\circ ({\rm d}q(t)\times {\rm d}f(x)) = {\rm d}f(tx)\circ {\rm d}m(t,x).$$Applying both sides on some $(s,y)$ gives (after a couple of steps): $$t^2 {\rm d}f(x)(y) + 2ts f(x) = t {\rm d}f(tx)(y) + s {\rm d}f(tx)(x).$$Making $s = 0$ we obtaing $t{\rm d}f(x) = {\rm d}f(tx)$ for all $t \neq 0$. Since ${\rm d}f(0) = 0$ (easy to check), we actually have ${\rm d}f(tx) = t{\rm d}f(x)$ for all real $t$.
