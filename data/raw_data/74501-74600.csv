922192,How to Integrate $\int\frac{(x^2)}{\sqrt{7-x^2}}dx$.,"I am trying to Integrate $\int\frac{(x^2)}{\sqrt{7-x^2}}dx$ and I have worked this problem a couple times and keep getting the same answer. So I will show my process and please point my errors out. 
$$a=\sqrt{7}\hspace{10pt} x=\sqrt{7}\sin\theta\hspace{10pt}dx=\sqrt{7}\cos\theta d\theta \hspace{7pt}7-x^2=7\cos^2\theta$$
$$\int\frac{7\sin^2\theta \sqrt{7}\cos\theta d\theta}{\sqrt{7\cos^2\theta}}$$
$$7\int\sin^2\theta d\theta\rightarrow \frac{7}{2}\int1-\cos(2\theta)d\theta$$
$$\frac{7}{2}\left(\theta-\frac{\sin(2\theta)}{2} \right) \rightarrow \frac{7}{2}\left(\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{7}}\right)-\frac{2\sin\theta\cos\theta}{2} \right)$$
$$\frac{7}{2}\left(\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{7}}\right)-\frac{x}{\sqrt{7-x^2}}\frac{\sqrt{7-x^2}}{\sqrt{7}} \right)$$
$$\frac{7}{2}\left(\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{7}}\right)-\frac{x}{\sqrt{7}} \right)$$
But apparently the answer is 
$$\frac{1}{2}\left(7\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{7}}\right)-x\sqrt{7-x^2} \right)$$
So how do I go about getting that answer? Thanks for all the help in advance.","['trigonometry', 'calculus', 'indefinite-integrals']"

922212,Area and volume relation (multivariable calculus problem),"Let $D \subset R^3$ a region over the plane $z=0$, if $C$ is the cone of base $D$ and vertex at $(0,0,1)$, show that $Vol(C)=\dfrac{1}{3}A(D)$, where $A(D)$ is the area of the region $D$. First I thought of applying Gauss (divergence) theorem over the region $W$, where $W$ is the region enclosed by the cone and the function $F=(x,y,z)$, in that case, we would have $$\iiint_W div(F)dV=\iint_{\partial W} F.dS.$$ We have $$\iiint_W div(F)dV=3\iiint_W 1dV=3Vol(C).$$ So I've tried to show $$\iint_{\partial W} F.dS=A(D)$$ but I couldn't. I've parametrized the cone ($\partial W$) by $T(u,v)=(u\cos(v),u\sin(v),u)$, then $T_u \times T_v=(-u\cos(v),-u\sin(v),u)$, so $$\iint_{\partial W} F.dS=\iint_{[0,1]\times [0,2\pi]} (u\cos(v),u\sin(v),u).(-u\cos(v),-u\sin(v),u)dudv=-u^2+u^2=0$$ Clearly the area of$D$ is not $0$.

922345,Closure of the difference of two sets vs difference of their closures,"This exercise is from Chapter 2, Section 17, number 8 (c), pag. 101, from Munkres's Topology. Let $A$, $B$ denote subsets of a space $X$. Determine whether the following equation holds: $$\overline {A - B} = \overline A - \overline B.$$ If it fails, determine whether one of the inclusions $\supset$ or $\subset$ holds. This exercise was very difficult for me. I tried the following way. Let $A^\prime$ be the set of all the limit points of $A$ that not belong to $A$; that is, $A \bigcap A^\prime = \varnothing$. Let $B^\prime$ be the set of all the limit points of $B$ that not belong to $B$; that is, $B \bigcap B^\prime = \varnothing$. By last, let $C$ be the set of all the limit points of $A - B$ that not belong to $A - B$; then, $(A - B) \bigcap C = \varnothing$. We proceed by contradiction. We have that $\overline A - \overline B = (A \bigcup A^\prime) - (B \bigcup B^\prime)$. Assume that there exists a point $x$ such that $x \in (\overline A - \overline B)$, but $x \not\in \overline {A - B}$. Then, the point $x$ does not belong neither to $B$ nor to $B^\prime$, because in such case $x$ would not belong to $\overline A - \overline B$. Besides, it can not belong to $A$ either, because in this case it would also belong to $\overline {A - B}$. Assume that $x \in A^\prime$; in such case, $x$ is one of the limit points of $A$ that not belong to $A$. Now, $x \not\in C$, because in this case it would also be in $\overline {A - B}$, which contradicts our initial hypothesis. But, to explain that $x \not\in C$, it is necessary to assume that $B$ extract from $A$ a subset which does not contain $x$, but it has $x$ as limit point . In such case, $x$ would be a limit point of $B$ as well, and this implies $x \in B$ or $x \in B^\prime$, contradicting our prior assertion. Therefore, it is not possible that $x \in (\overline A - \overline B)$ and $x \not\in \overline {A - B}$. It follows that $\overline {A - B} \supset \overline A - \overline B$. I'm not sure of this proof. Someone can tell me if there is another way of solving it? Thanks. Example of non-equality. Let $(0, 2)$ and $(1, 3]$ be intervals in $\mathbb{R}$. Then, the difference between the intervals is $(0, 1]$, and the closure of the difference is $[0, 1]$. On the other hand, the closures of the intervals $(0, 2)$ and $(1, 3]$ are $[0, 2]$ and $[1, 3]$, respectively. Consequently, the difference between closures is $[0, 1) \ne [0, 1]$.",['general-topology']

922419,Integrating $d\psi=(x+y)dx +x_0dy$,"I am quite embarrassed to ask this question, as I know i have lost track of the concept here, but Ill nevertheless ask it. I was going through Mathematical methods for physicists, and there was an example: ""Solve $y'+(1+\frac{y}{x}) = 0$"" My problem is, (a) when you put the equation into the general form of an exact equation, and get: $\psi = \int^{x}_{x_0} (x+y)dx + \int^{y}_{y_0} x_0dy$, $\psi   = \frac{x^2}{2} + xy + C$ , Why do you treat y and x as constant wrt to each other when integrating? More specifically, why is $\int^{y}_{y_0} x_0dy = x_0 \int^{y}_{y_0} dy$, and the same thing with y in the first integral? There is no explicit assumption of dependence of x on y and vice versa, So I'm guessing it is because P and Q of the exact solution are  functions of 2 variables, but you integrate only wrt one.

  at least 1 person has his own hat? The proposed solution uses inclusion-exclusion principle and gives the answer: $$\sum^{n}_{r=1} (-1)^{r-1} \frac{1}{r!}$$ But I think there is simpler solution: let's calculate the complement, i.e. no one gets his own hat. Total number of ways of distribution hats = number of permutations of hats, i.e. $n!$ Number of ways when no one gets his own hat is calculated as follows: fix a person, he can choose among n-1 hats, then, fix another person, he has n-2 hats at his disposal, and so on. This leads to $(n-1)!$ Therefore, my answer is $1 - \frac{(n-1)!}{n!} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$ which is wrong. My question is where did I make a mistake?","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

922524,Intersection of an open dense set and any dense set is dense.,"I am going through an introductory topology chapter and finding some difficulty in the following question. I had a chance to go through Daniel's and Brian's answers on this page .
However, I am still a bit not convinced. If $D_1$ is an open dense set in  $\mathbb R^p$ and $D_2$ is any dense set in $\mathbb R^p$, then,Show that $D_1 \cap D_2$ are also dense in $\mathbb R^p$ . Attempt: Given that $D_1$ is an open dense set in  $\mathbb R^p$ which means if $x \in D_1^c$, then every neighborhood of $x$ contains at least one element of $D_1$. But, this fact is contradictory because elements of $D_1$ are not supposed to be in every neighborhood of elements in $D_1^c$. $(a)~$Hence, can we infer that $D_1^c$ must not have any non void open set else any open ball in $D_1^c$ will also contain elements of $D_1$ which is a contradiction? Suppose that $D_1 \cap D_2$ is not dense in $\mathbb R^p$. Then, for some $y \in \mathbb R^p$, there is a neighborhood of $y = B(y,r)$ which does not contain any element of $D_1 \cap D_2$. This is certainly possible because $B(y,r)$ can contain elements of $D_1/ (D_1 \cap D_2)$ and $D_2/ (D_1 \cap D_2)$. How do I move forward?

922568,Some questions about Hartshorne chapter 2 proposition 2.6,"In Hartshorne chapter 2 proposition 2.6, Hartshorne shows that there is a fully faithful functor $t:\mathcal{Var}\rightarrow \mathcal{Sch}(k)$ from the category of varieties over $k$ to the category of schemes over $k$ . He proceeds as follows: First, for any topological space $X$ , define $t(X)$ to be the set of irreducible closed subsets of $X$ . We can define a topology on $t(X)$ by taking as closed sets the subsets of the form $t(Y)$ , where $Y$ is closed subset of $X$ . If $f:X_1\rightarrow X_2$ is continuous, then define a map $$t(f):t(X_1)\rightarrow t(X_2)\\ Y\mapsto \overline{f(Y)},$$ where $Y$ is a irreducible closed subset of $X_1$ . And, for any topological space $X$ , define $\alpha :X\rightarrow t(X)$ by $\alpha(p)=\overline{\{p\}}$ . Question 1: Why is $\overline{f(Y)}$ a irreducible closed subset of $X_2$ ? Next, let $V$ be an affine variety over $k$ with coordinate ring $A$ , and $O_V$ its sheaf of regular functions, he then shows that $(t(V), \alpha_*(O_V))$ is isomorphic to the affine scheme $(X,O_X)$ , where $X=\operatorname{Spec}A$ . Question 2: Why is $(t(V),\alpha_*(O_V))$ a locally ringed spaces, I mean why is $(\alpha_*(O_V))_Y$ a local ring for any $Y\in t(V)$ ? Now define a morphism of locally ringed spaces $\beta:(V,O_V)\rightarrow X=\operatorname{Spec}A,$ by $\beta(p)=m_p$ . And for any open set $U\subset X$ ,define a homomorphism of rings $O_X(U)\rightarrow \beta_*(O_V)(U)$ :given $s\in O_X(U)$ , $p\in \beta^{-1}(U)$ , we get a regular function $g$ on $\beta^{-1}(U)$ by $g(p):=\overline{s_{\beta(p)}}\in A_{m_p}/m_p=k$ ,where $s_{\beta(p)}\in O_{X,\beta(p)}$ and we identify the stalk $O_{X,\beta(p)}$ with the local ring $A_{m_p}$ . Question 3: Why is $g$ a regular function? It seems to me that $g$ is locally constant, is this true? Then he claims that the above homomorphism $O_X(U)\rightarrow \beta_*(O_V)(U)$ is an isomorphism and uses the fact that there is a 1-1 correspondence $t(V)\leftrightarrow \operatorname{Spec}A=X$ , then $(X,O_X)\cong (t(V),\alpha_*(O_V))$ as locally ringed spaces. I can't follow this part of proof. Question 4: What is this $\beta$ used for? Shouldn't we construct a morphism $(t(V),\alpha_*(O_V))\rightarrow (X,O_X)$ ? And why is $O_X(U)\rightarrow \beta_*(O_V)(U)$ an isomorphism?",['algebraic-geometry']

The question: Which general assumptions on $f$ ensure solvability in a (Sobolev) weak sense ? In particular, I want the solution $y$ to be in $H^1 = W^{1,2}$, i.e. $y$ should be $L^2$, $y$ should be weakly differentiable, $y'$ should be $L^2$ and the weak derivative of $y$ should coincide with $f(t,y(t))$ almost everywhere. This should be an extremely basic question, but I do not know relevant literature. [I seem to have an existence proof in the case $f(t,y) = A(t) y$, where $A \in L^2([0,T], \mathbb{R}^{n \times n})$, by mimicking the usual proof of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem and simply considering the usual integral operator as an operator $L^2([0,T], \mathbb{R}^n) \to L^2([0,T], \mathbb{R}^n)$.

For example if we put it in a true statement about the natural numbers it doesn't make sense: 4×2=8 does it mean that {{{{{}}}}}×{{{}}}={{{{{{{{{}}}}}}}}}? The only concept of set ""multiplication"" is the Cartesian product but unfortunately I don't know it... Also if we have 6/2=3 does it mean that {{{{{{{}}}}}}}/{{{}}}={{{{}}}}? So there's some sort of set ""division""? Also why does one think that a ""number"" is a set? Or is it that I'm the one who misunderstands things here maybe we ""assign"" a natural number to a set, that is for example: 1→{{}}, but then what does ""assign"" mean and how do you define the natural numbers in the first place?

922979,A question about a mathematical analysis book,"I am a newcomer to Analysis. All knowledge I know about ""Analysis"" are differentials,limit and integration (basically, what we have been taught in high school) I am studying Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin, and I must say that this is, by far, the most difficult book I have ever touched. Even my Ph.D Microeconomic Theory by Mas Colell is not as hard as this book. I struggled a lot with Rudin,trying to draw some pictures about open sets, closed sets,perfect sets,..., but I still cannot grasp the ""gist"" of Analysis. So, I realize that Rudin may not be good enough for self-study due to its superb terseness and decide to switch to other Analysis's book in order to get a good picture of what Real Analysis is. Rudin lacks of ability to do that since it assumes the reader must know some topology to a degree. Hence, I am looking for a good substitution of Rudin and have seen on Amazon that there is a book called ""Mathematical Analysis I"" and ""Mathematical Analysis II"" written by Zorich that can cover Real Analysis that a math major undergraduate needs to know. Is there anyone know how good those books are so I can prepare a very great Analysis courses for myself? I will definitely read Rudin again, but now I think I need some books as great as Spivak's Calculus book so that I can understand Analysis in a very good way. I know Apostol's is a good book, but I want to learn a book that can cover as much material as it can in the shortest time so that I can reach Royden's later on. I thank you very much for your advice. EDIT 1 : So, after having read all of your advice (and Mr.Dave's), I WANT TO ""invent""  a way to read and understand Rudin's Analysis. Since Rudin is now causing me difficulty in understanding concepts in chapter 2's topology(perfect sets,open sets, closed set, closure sets, cantor sets,connected sets), I have 3 choices: Spivak's Calculus => Apostol's => Rudin's => Royden's Spivak's Calculus => Zorich (I+II) => Rudin's => Royden's Spivak's Calculus => Munkres's Introduction to Topology => Rudin's => Royden's Which one do you think it is the most appropriate way? I thank you for your advice. EDIT 2 : I thank you very much for your advice, Mr.Dave. However, I have a big trouble with topology in the very chapter 2 of Rudin's Analysis. After reading Spivak's, does my trouble go away? Because after reading materials in chapter 2, I have A VERY VAGUE understanding of what a limit point, perfect sets,infinite,finite,countable,uncountable, open sets,closed sets,...etc. Topology is really really difficult.","['calculus', 'education', 'reference-request', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
923009,Memoryless property and geometric distribution,"Suppose $X$ is a random variable taking values in $\mathbb N_0$ with the memoryless property,i.e., for each pair of number $s,t \in \mathbb N$, $$P(X\geq s+t\mid X>t)=P(X\geq s)$$ Show that a random variable $X$ with values in $\mathbb N_0$ has the memoryless property if and only if $X \sim \text{Geometric}(p)$ of parameter $p=P(X=1)$. I could show that if $X \sim \text{Geometric}(p)$ (for an arbitrary parameter $p$), then $X$ has the memoryless property. I'll write that part of the answer: $$P(X\geq s)=\sum_{i=s}^{\infty} P(X=i)$$$$=\sum_{i=s}^{\infty} (1-p)^{i-1}p$$$$=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (1-p)^{i-1}p-\sum_{i=0}^{s-1}(1-p)^{i-1}p$$$$=\frac{p}{1-p}(\frac{1}{1-(1-p)}-\frac{1-(1-p)^s}{1-(1-p)})$$$$=(1-p)^{s-1}.$$ Similarly, $$P(X\geq s+t\mid X>t)=\dfrac{P((X\geq s+t)\cap (X>t))}{P(X>t)}$$$$=\dfrac{P(X\geq s+t)}{P(X>t)}.$$ After calculating the probability of the numerator and the probability of the denominator, one can arrive to the same expression $$\dfrac{P(X\geq s+t)}{P(X>t)}=(1-p)^{s-1}.$$ So from here one deduces that the geometric random variable has the memoryless property. I got stuck trying to show the other implication: Let $s \in \mathbb N, t=1$, let $E=\{X>1\}$, then $$P(X\geq k+1)=P(X \geq k+1\mid X>1)P(X>1)+P(X\geq k+1 \mid X \leq 1)P(X \leq 1).$$ Since the probability $P(X\geq k+1 \mid X \leq 1)=0$, then $$P(X\geq k+1)=P(X \geq k+1\mid X>1)P(X>1)$$ Using the hypothesis, we have $$P(X \geq k+1)=P(X \geq k+1\mid X>1)P(X>1)=P(X \geq k)P(X>1)$$ I got stuck at that point, I want to conclude that $P(X=k)=(1-p)^{k-1}p$, where $p=P(X=1)$.

If $x \in B_{1} \cap B_{2}$ for some $B_{1}, B_{2} \in \mathcal{B}$, then $\exists B_{3} \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B_{3} \subseteq B_{1} \cap B_{2}$.

Here is my question: I want to prove that if $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}}$.  Showing $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ is really easy.  To show $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T_{\mathcal{B}}}$ relies on some ""fact"" that I don't know to prove: that if $U \in \mathcal{T}$, and $x \in U$, $\exists B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subseteq U$. How do I prove that for any $U \in \mathcal{T}$, $\exists B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subseteq U$?  I don't see how this fact follows from the definition of a basis.

Using the fact that $\sum_{k = 0}^n k {n \choose k}=n2^{n-1}$ and that $\sum_{k = 0}^n k(k-1) {n \choose k}  =[\sum_{k = 0}^n (x^k)'' {n \choose k}]|_{x=1}=[\sum_{k = 0}^n (x^k) {n \choose k}]'' |_{x=1}=[(x+1)^n]'' |_{x=1} = n(n-1)2^{n-2}$ (where we use the binomial expansion $(x+1)^n=\sum_{k = 0}^n x^k {n \choose k}$), one can easily evaluate the desired sum as being equal to $n(n+1)2^{n-3}$. Clearly, one can continue this method to find (recursively) formulas for the sums $\sum_{k = 0}^n k^t {n \choose k}$ where $t$ is a positive integer. For example, one more iteration gives $\sum_{k = 0}^n k^3 {n \choose k}=n^2(n+3)2^{n-3}$ (if I did not made any calculation error). So, if we define $F(t)$ to be the polynomial such that $\sum_{k = 0}^n k^t {n \choose k} = 2^{n-t} F(t)$, my question is simply: Is there a closed formula for $F(t)$?

After all projects had been turned in, the instructor randomly ordered them before grading. Consider the first 15 graded projects. 1) What is the probability that exactly 10 of these are from the second section? My assumptions for a hypergeometric rv X are as follows:
You have a population of N objects. 
Each object can be characterized as S or F.
There are M successes in the population. 
A sample of n objects is selected without replacement in such a way that each subset of size n is equally likely to be chosen.
If x is the number of S's in a completely random sample of size n drawn from a population consisting of M S's and (N-M) F's, then the probability distribution of X, called the hypergeometric distribution, is given by $$
P(X = x) = h(x; n, M, N) = \frac{{M \choose x} {N-M \choose n-x}}{N \choose n}  
$$ Analyzing this problem, it seemed to me that the assumptions led to this correspondence:
Population of 50 students (N = 50).  Class 1 represented as F and Class 2 represented as S. M would be 30, since M is the number of S in the population. A sample of n objects is selected (15 papers chosen), and the question asks what the probability is that 10 of these is a S (10 are in class 2). So my understanding of the problem was that the answer would be h(10; 15, 30, 50), which is 0.2069. However, when I was checking my work against the solutions, I found that the correct answer was h(x; 10, 15, 50) and I have difficulty understanding why this is the case...

924116,Growth rate of logarithmic function?,Just curious about the growth rate of the logarithmic function: Does there exist a real number $n$ such that $lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{(ln(x))^{n}}{x}$ diverges (does not converge to $0$)? Thanks in advance!,"['logarithms', 'limits']"
924121,Geometric proof for triple vector product Jacobi identity,I believe the vector identity $\vec{a} \times (\vec{b} \times \vec{c}) + \vec{b} \times (\vec{c} \times \vec{a}) + \vec{c} \times (\vec{a} \times \vec{b}) = 0$ is called the Jacobi identity and I know the proof. Does anybody know of some elegant geometrical picture to illustrate why the identity is true?,"['cross-product', 'linear-algebra', 'vector-analysis']"
924134,factoring $x^n+x+1$,Is there a way of factoring a polynomial of the general form $$x^n+x+1$$ in the ring $\mathbb C[x]$ or $\mathbb R[x]$ or $\mathbb Z [x]$ for any $n \in \mathbb N$? (Or perhaps with certain conditions on $n$?),"['factoring', 'prime-factorization', 'abstract-algebra']"
924147,Prove that $|e^{i\theta_1}-e^{i\theta_2}| \leq |\theta_1 - \theta_2|$,"I'm trying to prove the inequality $$|e^{i\theta_1}-e^{i\theta_2}| \leq |\theta_1 - \theta_2|$$ I have tried to use Taylor's formula and got this $$|e^{i\theta_1}-e^{i\theta_2}| = |(1+i\theta_1 - \frac{\theta_1^2}{2} + \ldots) -(1 +i\theta_2 - \frac{\theta_2^2}{2} + \ldots)| = |i(\theta_1-\theta_2) + \frac{\theta_2^2-\theta_1^2}{2}+\ldots|$$ The first term looks right, but how do I proceed?","['exponential-function', 'inequality', 'complex-analysis']"
