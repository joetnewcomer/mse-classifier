1231181,Correspondence between line bundles and $U(1)$-bundles: a mistake from the physicists?,"I am reading a paper written by physicists and they say the following: Let $(L,h,\nabla)$ be an holomorphic line bundle equipped with a Hermitian metric $h$ and Chern connection $\nabla$ . If $e^{f_{ab}}$ are the transition functions of $L$ on the non-empty overlapping of two open sets $U_{a}$ and $U_{b}$ , then the transition functions in the associated $U(1)$ -bundle $\mathcal{U}$ are $e^{iIm(f_{ab})}$ . In addition, let $\theta$ be the local one-form connection of $\nabla$ on a local trivialization of $L$ . Then corresponding connection on the $U(1)$ -bundle $\mathcal{U}$ is $Im(\theta) = -\frac{i}{2}(\theta - \bar{\theta})$ . Then, the covariant derivative of any section $\Psi\in\Gamma(\mathcal{U})$ is $d\Psi + Im(\theta)\Psi$ . My question is: is this correct?

  $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2} < 1$ and $a,b,c$
  are positive constants. This is a question in a past exam paper that I am revising for. My attempt at the question: First scale the coordinates by making the change $(x,y,z) = (au,bv,cw)$, which means we are now integrating over a sphere, as opposed to an ellipsoid. The Jacobian for this transformation is abc and thus our new integral is $$abc\iiint_{\text{Unit Sphere}}\sin^2(au + bv + cw) \,\mathrm{d}u\,\mathrm{d}v\,\mathrm{d}w$$ Now I need to rotate the coordinates so that our integral will be easier to evaluate once we eventually transform to spherical polar coordinates. We consider this as $$abc\iiint_{\text{Unit Sphere}}\sin^2((a,b,c)\cdot\mathbf{r}) \,\mathrm{d}u\,\mathrm{d}v\,\mathrm{d}w$$ where $\mathbf{r}$ represents our coordinate system. Then by rotating the coordinates to form new coordinates $X,Y,Z$ in such a way that the $Z$ axis points in the direction of the vector $(a,b,c)$ the integral becomes $$abc\iiint_{\text{Unit Sphere}}\sin^2(\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}\mathbf{e_3}\cdot\mathbf{r})\, \mathrm{d}V = abc\iiint_{\text{Unit Sphere}}\sin^2(Z\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}) \,\mathrm{d}V$$ Now we change to spherical polar coordinates $(X,Y,Z) = (r\sin\theta\cos\phi, r\sin\theta\sin\phi,r\cos\theta)$ and our integral becomes $$abc\int_{r=0}^1\int_{\theta=0}^\pi\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} \left( \sin^2(r\cos\theta\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2})\cdot r^2\sin\theta\right)\,\mathrm{d}\phi\,\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}r$$ And it is at this point I become stumped.

1231431,Order-preserving map of regressive functions on $\omega_1$,"I posted the following question in March 2014 on MO . It did receive some attention, but the answer there remains incomplete. It was motivated by some paracompactness-type properties as discussed at the end, but the question is purely order-theoretic, about $\omega_1$ . Let $\omega_1$ be the first uncountable ordinal,
same as the set of all countable ordinals. Let $\mathcal F$ be the set of all functions $f:\omega_1\to\omega_1$ that
are: (a) regressive i.e. $f(\alpha) < \alpha$ for all $0 < \alpha < \omega_1$ ,
and (b) non-decreasing (same as $\le$ -order-preserving),
i.e., if $0\le\alpha \leq \beta<\omega_1$ then $f(\alpha)\leq f(\beta)$ . Define a partial order $\sqsubseteq$ on $\mathcal F$ by $f \sqsubseteq g$ if $f(\alpha) \leq g(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha < \omega_1$ . Let $\mathcal K$ be the subset of $\mathcal F$ , consisting of functions with
a finite range. Formally $\mathcal K=\{f\in\mathcal F: |\{f(\alpha):\alpha<\omega_1\}|<\aleph_0\}$ . Question: Is there a $\sqsubseteq$ -order-preserving map
(same as a $\sqsubseteq$ -non-decreasing map) $\psi : \mathcal F \to \mathcal K$ , i.e if $f \sqsubseteq g$ then $\psi(f) \sqsubseteq \psi(g)$ , and with the additional property that $\psi(f) \sqsupseteq f$ for all $f\in \mathcal F$ ? Let me summarize some comments made at MO, clarifying certain partial answers. Partial answer (A) . Since every $f\in\mathcal F$ is regressive and non-decreasing, it must be eventually constant and reach its maximal value $\mu_f=\max\{f(\alpha):\alpha < \omega_1\}$ . One is tempted to define $\psi(f)(\alpha)=\mu_f$ for all $\alpha$ . The problem is that this is not regressive: We have $\psi(f)(\alpha)<\alpha$ only when $\alpha>\mu_f$ , but I insist that $\psi(f)(\alpha)<\alpha$ whenever $0<\alpha<\omega_1$ . Partial answer (B) . If we drop the requirement that $\psi$ be a $\sqsubseteq$ -non-decreasing map then the answer by @NoahS at MO works, as well as one of my comments there, which  I include below. As above let $\mu_f=\max\{f(\alpha):\alpha < \omega_1\}$ and let $\gamma_f=\min\{\alpha:f(\alpha)=\mu_f\}$ . (Then $f(\alpha)=\mu_f$ for $\alpha\ge\gamma_f$ , and $f(\alpha)<\mu_f$ for $\alpha<\gamma_f$ . Usually $\mu_f<\gamma_f$ unless $\mu_f=0=\gamma_f$ .)
Let $\alpha_{0,f}=\mu_f$ . If $\mu_f\ge1$ then let $\alpha_{1,f}=f(\alpha_{0,f})<\alpha_{0,f}$ . There is a non-negative integer $n_f$ such that $\alpha_{k+1,f}=f(\alpha_{k,f})<\alpha_{k,f}$ for $k<n_f$ , and $\alpha_{n_f,f}=0$ . Define $\psi(f)$ as follows. If $\alpha>\alpha_{0,f}$ then let $\psi(f)(\alpha)=\alpha_{0,f}=\mu_f$ . If $\alpha_{k+1,f}<\alpha\le\alpha_{k,f}$ then let $\psi(f)(\alpha)=\alpha_{k+1,f}$ . (Formally also $\psi(f)(0)=0$ , but in general each function in $\mathcal F$ being regressive must take value $0$ at $1$ , and being non-decreasing must take value $0$ at $0$ as well.) Then $\psi(f)\in\mathcal K$ and $\psi(f)\sqsupseteq f$ . So partial answer (A) above achieves that $\psi(f)$ has a finite range, and $\psi(f) \sqsubseteq \psi(g)$ whenever $f \sqsubseteq g$ , and also $\psi(f) \sqsupseteq f$ . It almost achieves that $\psi(f)$ is regressive, but not quite, and it follows that $\psi(f)$ is not in $\mathcal K$ unless $\mu_f=0$ . (One could perhaps say that $\psi(f)$ is "" regressive on a tail "" only, which might in a different context be good enough, but the requirement in my question is that $\psi(f)(\alpha)<\alpha$ whenever $0<\alpha<\omega_1$ .) On the other hand, partial answer $B$ achieves that $\psi(f)\in\mathcal K$ (in particular both that $\psi(f)$ is regressive and has a finite range), and $\psi(f) \sqsupseteq f$ for all $f\in \mathcal F$ , but not necessarily that $\psi(f) \sqsubseteq \psi(g)$ whenever $f\sqsubseteq g$ . It is not clear to me if we could achieve all conditions simultaneously. Edit. Following a comment (on MO), let me clarify why in partial answer $B$ we need not have $\psi(f) \sqsubseteq \psi(g)$ whenever $f\sqsubseteq g$ . Fix any ordinals $0<\beta<\delta<\nu<\omega_1$ . Let $f(\alpha)=g(\alpha)=0$ if $0\le\alpha<\nu$ . Let $f(\alpha)=\beta$ and $g(\alpha)=\delta$ if $\alpha\ge\nu$ .
Clearly $f\sqsubseteq g$ .
Then $\psi(f)(\alpha)=\beta$ if $\alpha>\beta$ , and $\psi(f)(\alpha)=0$ if $0\le\alpha\le\beta$ (where $\psi$ is as in partial answer $B$ ).
While $\psi(g)(\alpha)=\delta$ if $\alpha>\delta$ , and $\psi(g)(\alpha)=0$ if $0\le\alpha\le\delta$ . In particular, if $\beta<\alpha\le\delta$ then $\psi(g)(\alpha)=0<\beta=\psi(f)(\alpha)$ ,
so $\psi(f)\not\sqsubseteq \psi(g)$ . If I were to make a guess, I would say the answer is no.
This question is an order-theoretic restatement of a question from general topology that a co-author and I considered : Whether $\omega_1$ has a monotone interior-preserving open operator $r$ , that is, if $\mathcal U$ is any open cover of $\omega_1$ , with the order topology, then $r(\mathcal U)$ is an interior-preserving open refinement that covers $\omega_1$ , and if $\mathcal U$ refines $\mathcal V$ then $r(\mathcal U)$ refines $r(\mathcal V)$ . As usual we would write $\mathcal U\preceq \mathcal V$ if $\mathcal U$ refines $\mathcal V$ . In this context $f$ is intended to encode an open cover $\mathcal U(f)=\{0\}\cup\{(f(\alpha),\alpha]:\alpha<\omega_1\}$ . Note that if $f\sqsubseteq g$ then $\mathcal U(g)\preceq \mathcal U(f)$ . Update Oct 19, 2018 (and May 21, 2019): This question has now been published in a journal. It is Question 3.2 in the following paper: Serdica Math. J. 44 (2018) (dedicated to the memory of Professor Stoyan Nedev (1942−2015)) ON MONOTONE ORTHOCOMPACTNESS S.G. Popvassilev, J.E. Porter Here is a temporary link from the editors: http://www.math.bas.bg/serdica/2018/2018-177-186.pdf (Update as of August 21, 2020.) This question has been answered in the negative by Gary Gruenhage. I will post a complete answer some time in the future. Here is a sketch of the proof. The existence of an order-preserving map $\psi$ as in the question is equivalent to $\omega_1$ being monotonically orthocompact via open refinements, abbrevaited MO $_o$ (this is Theorem 3.1 in the paper, a link to which is enclosed at the end of this question). What Gary proved is that MO $_o$ implies a certain property called (A $_o$ ) (defined in terms of certain neignborhoods), and that $\omega_1$ does not have this property (A $_o$ ). (Update April 25, 2021.) I am about to publish an answer here with details of Gary Gruenhage's proof (thus answering the above question is the negative).

1231645,Solutions of the constant coefficient Helmholtz equation via the Fourier transform,"When $f$ is a rapidly decaying Schwartz function, 
$$
g(x) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \sin \left(2\lambda\left|x-y\right|\right) f(y)\ dy
$$
is an element of $C^\infty\left(\mathbb{R}\right)$ and a solution of the Helmholtz equation
$$
y''(t) + \lambda^2 y(t) = f(t).
\tag{1}
$$
Moreover, the Fourier transform of $g$ is the tempered distribution
which is the principal value of 
$$
\frac{\widehat{f}(\xi)}{\lambda^2-\xi^2}.
\tag{2}
$$ If we assume only that $f$ is in $L^1\left(\mathbb{R}\right)$, then $g$ is still an element of $C^\infty\left(\mathbb{R}\right)$ and it is still a solution of (1) (this follows easily from the dominated convergence theorem).  However, it is not clear to me that (2) is defined (the Fourier transform might not be Lipschitz continous, in which case the principal value integral might not exist). I am not sure that (2) is not defined.  Is it the case that if $f$ is the Fourier transform of a $L^1\left(\mathbb{R}\right)$
function then 
$$
\lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \int_{|x|>\epsilon} \frac{f(x)}{x}\ dx
\tag{3}
$$
must exist?  It is easy to construct an example of a continuous function
$f(x)$ for which (3) does not exist -- for example,
$$
f(x) = \frac{\mbox{sign}(x)}{1+|\log(x)|}.
$$
I have not, however, been able to construct such a function and show that it is the image of an integrable function under the Fourier transform. Assuming that (2) does not define a tempered distribution for all $f \in L^1\left(\mathbb{R}\right)$, is there some other way of interpreting (2)?  Clearly, one could obtain the Fourier transform of g as a limit of some tempered distributions.  For instance, let
$$
\phi(x) = \frac{1}{2\lambda i} \exp\left(\lambda i |x|\right)
$$
so that $g$ is the real part of $\phi*f$.  Also, let 
$$
\phi_t (x) = \frac{1}{2(\lambda+i t) i} \exp((\lambda+i t) i |x|).
$$
Since $\phi_t * f $ converges to $\phi *f$ in the space of tempered
distributions (in fact, it converges in $L^\infty\left(\mathbb{R}\right)$),
$$
\frac{\widehat{f}(\xi)}{(\lambda +i t)^2 - \xi^2}=\widehat{\phi_t} \widehat{f} = \widehat{\phi_t*f} \to \widehat{\phi *f }
\ \ \ \mbox{as} \ \ t \to 0
$$
in the space of tempered distributions.  And we can, of course, recover $\widehat{g}$ from $\widehat{\phi *f}$. This is deeply unsatisfying to me for some reason --- perhaps because $g$ is defined as a convolution and I very much wish to interpret it as a product of Fourier transforms.","['harmonic-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

Determine which of the following three elements are in $H$. The answer is $p,pq,p^{q}$.  However, I am completely confused as how to get here. I thought I might know something, but I don't really have any reasons for why they might be, so I figured I don't actually know why. Could someone show me the proof or reasoning why this is so?","['abstract-algebra', 'prime-numbers', 'gre-exam']"

Obviously, $\emptyset$ is ${\mathbb Q}$-stable and has measure zero,
and $[0,1]$ is ${\mathbb Q}$-stable and has measure one.
Are there ${\mathbb Q}$-stable subsets with measure other
than $0$ or $1$ ? EDIT : Let $A$ be ${\mathbb Q}$-stable. It is easy to see that
if $[a,b[$ and $[c,d[$ are two subintervals of $[0,1]$ with
rational endpoints and with the same length ($d-c=b-a$), then
$A\cap [c,d[=(c-a)+A\cap [a,b[$ whence $\mu(A\cap [c,d[)=
\mu(A\cap [a,b[)$. It follows that
there is a function $\alpha : [0,1] \to {\mathbb R}_{+}$

$[0,1]$. The map $\alpha$ is obviously nondecreasing. Also,
if $x,y \in {\mathbb Q}$ are nonnnegative with $x+y\leq 1$ then
$(A\cap [0,x+y[)$ is the disjoint union of 
$(A\cap [0,x[)$ and $(A\cap [x,x+y[)$, and hence 
$\alpha(x+y)=\alpha(x)+\alpha(y)$. It follows that there is a constant $c$ such that
$\alpha(t)=ct$ for any $t\in{\mathbb Q}\cap [0,1[$. By monotonicity
the inequality stays true if we take $t\in [0,1[$. Not sure about

Then consider a morphism $f:X\to Y$, such that $f(p) = (f_1(p),\ldots, f_m(p))$, with $f_i\in K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ for $i=1\ldots m$.

It is defined by $\phi(y_i+I(Y)) = f_i+I(X)$. We can also go the reverse way and induce a morphism from this kind of homomorphism, in fact there is a bijection between these morphisms and homomorphisms. It is possible to go a step further and define a map (which is also called a morphism) $\phi^*:Spec(K[X])\to Spec(K[Y])$ given by $\phi^*(P) = \phi^{-1}(P)$. We say that $\phi^*$ is induced by $\phi$. From my reading, looks like $f$ is a isomorphism $\iff\phi$ is a isomorphism $\iff\phi^*$ is a isomorphism. I want to know if this is true. Also, it's said that obtaining $\phi^*$ from $\phi$ is a generalization of obtaining $\phi$ from $f$, how is that so? ADD: some important definitions below.

1231999,Why Are Fresnel Functions Used For Splines?,"Why are Fresnel functions still used in the research and implementation of clothoid splines?  They cannot represent curves of constant curvature, which has led to a lot of research/implementation complexity.  For example, see this paper: http://www.mit.edu/~ibaran/curves/ $\dots$that constructs a clothoid spline by finding the shortest path through a graph of possible clothoid/arc/line combinations. Fresnels are derived by integrating the following curvature function: $k = 2s$ There are many superior alternatives; I've attached one alternative I came up with to this post, but see Raph Levien's PhD thesis for another: http://www.levien.com/phd/phd.html Why are fresnels still around?  Levien's work dates from 2007, and some guy in the early 90s also did research on (polynomial) curvature functions.  As far as I can tell, most of the modern clothoid literature is little more advanced than where the literature was in the late 60s – it’s as if people like Levien never published at all.  Is this a failure of the peer review system?  Or does the fault lie with the way clothoid research is fragmented between many different fields that don't really communicate with each other? Anyway, here’s the curve I came up with.  See Levien's thesis for a more in-depth discussion of why simple fresnels aren’t good enough (as well we his method, which is a bit better than the one here). Addendum.
A Better Euler Spiral Formulation If our goal is to create a spline whose curvature function is piecewise linear, we can use this curvature function: $k = k_1*(1.0-s) + k_2*s$ This function interpolates two constants over the interval [0, 1].
If you integrate it, you get these replacements for the fresnel functions: $th(s) = s(k_2s - k_1s + 2k_1) / 2$ $x(s) = \int_{0}^{s} \sin(th(s))$ $y(s) = \int_{0}^{s} \cos(th(s))$ These functions can represent lines, arcs, and clothoids, and is far easier to work with than if all three types are treated separately.","['calculus', 'special-functions', 'plane-curves', 'geometry', 'spline']"

1232197,How do I show that a directional derivative is defined in every direction (for every vector) for a function $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$?,"I'm working through some analysis books, and while working through the section on directional derivatives, I searched here and found this answer , which states Let $f: R^2 \to R$ be defined by $f(x,y)= \frac{x^3y}{x^4+y^2}$ for $(x,y) \neq (0,0)$ and $f(0,0) = 0$.  This function is continuous; its directional derivative is defined at each point in every direction; and at each point its directional derivative is a linear function of the direction. I set about trying to show this at the origin, and here's what I have so far: We have $g(t) = (x, y) + (v, w)t$, so $g(0) = (x, y)$. To find the directional derivative, I want to find $(f \circ g)'(0) = G'(0)$. Taking the composition and doing the algreba, I get \begin{align}
G(t)
&= (f \circ g)(t) \\
&= \frac{(x+vt)^3 (y+wt)}{(x+vt)^4+(y+wt)^2} \\
&= (x+vt)^3 (y+wt) \left[ (x+vt)^4+(y+wt)^2 \right]^{-1}
\end{align} From the Chain Rule wrt $t$:
\begin{align}
G'(t) &= \frac{3v(x+vt)^2 (y+wt) + w(x+vt)^3}{(x+vt)^4+(y+wt)^2} - \frac{(4v(x+vt)^3 + 2w(y+wt)) (x+vt)^3 (y+wt) } {((x+vt)^4+(y+wt)^2 )^2} \\
\implies G'(0) &= \frac{3vx^2y + wx^3}{x^4+y^2} - \frac{(4vx^3 + 2wy) x^3 y } {(x^4+y^2)^2}
\end{align} Assuming I did all that algebra correctly, I don't see where this gets me. Do I then have to use the definition of a derivative in one dimension and show that $G'(0)$ satisfies differentiability at $0$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
G(t) = G(0) + G'(0)(t-0) + X(t-0)
\end{equation} and $\lim_{t\to0} \frac{X(t-0)}{t-0} = 0$? edit: I found this answer that takes another approach, so using that method, where $y$ is the direction vector and $a$ is the point at which we take the derivative, gives me this: \begin{align}
\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(\mathbf{a} + h\mathbf{y}) - f(\mathbf{a})}{h}
&= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f((0,0) + h(y_{1},y_{2})) - f(\mathbf{0})}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(hy_{1},hy_{2})}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{(hy_1)^3 (hy_2)}{h((hy_1)^4 + (hy_2)^2)} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{h^4 y_1^3 y_2}{h(h^4y_1^4 + h^2y_2^2)} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{h^4 y_1^3 y_2}{h^3(h^2y_1^4 + y_2^2)} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{h y_1^3 y_2}{(h^2y_1^4 + y_2^2)} \\
&= 0
\end{align} Since this limit exists, regardless of the values for the vector $\mathbf{y}$ (assuming that $\mathbf{y}$ isn't the zero vector, can I conclude that the directional derivative exists for all nonzero vectors?","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives']"
1232215,Evenly Spaced Integer Topology is Metrizable,"Furstenberg's proof uses an evenly spaced integer topology on $\mathbb Z$ which declares that a basis of open sets as those of the form $a + b \mathbb Z$ (i.e. arithmetic progressions). I'm interested in whether this space is metrizable. Pi-base claims that is, but I can't understand what's written. It says The topology on $X$ is generated by the metric $d(n,m) = \frac{1}{2^k}$ where $k$ is the largest number such that $p^k \mid |n-m|$ (and $d(n,n) = 0$ ). Note that with this metric, $B(n,\frac{1}{2^{-k}}) = \{m: p^l | |n-m|\}$ for some $l > k = \bigcup_{l > k} \{n+ap^l : a \in X\} = U_{k+1}(n)$ . I can't understand what this is saying. Presumably $p$ is a fixed prime (otherwise $\frac{1}{8} = d(0,81)+d(81,97) < d(0,97)=1$ , for example). But then I don't see how $q\mathbb Z$ can possibly contain any neighborhood of zero (where $q \ne p$ is also prime), since any neighborhood of zero seems to necessarily contain a power of $p$ .

1232394,infinite monkey problem - probability of an infinite sequence containing an infinite sequence [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Given an infinite number of monkeys and an infinite amount of time, would one of them write Hamlet? (13 answers) Closed 9 years ago . Note: This question is specifically about when the infinite monkey theorem is extended to reproducing an infinite sequence (as oppose to a finite one) I was browsing wikipedia, and came across the infinite monkey problem. I understand that if Random keys are selected for an infinite period of time, eventually any finite combination of characters will eventually be produced. For example, a complete copy of Hamlet. However, I am confused about what happens when this is extended to infinity. According to wikipedia: If the monkey's allotted length of text is infinite, the chance of typing only the digits of pi is $0$, which is just as possible as typing nothing but Gs (also probability $0$). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem#Almost_surely However, this suggests that the probability of typing any combination of characters (that are infinitely long) is also $0$. However, the probability that a combination is typed is 1. However the sum of all possible events appears to be $0$, not $1$ (as the probability of any combination of infinite length being typed such as pi is $0$ as $0+0+0+0+...+0=0$ I'm not sure if I have just misunderstood this problem or if I have made a false assumption. It might have something to do with concept of ""Almost certainly"", but I was a bit intimidated by the wikipedia article.","['infinity', 'probability']"

1232483,Metric tensors and linear (differential) operators defined on a manifold and its osculating sphere,"Given a 1D Riemannian manifold  $\Gamma$  embedded in 2D Euclidean space  (e.g. a parametric curve on a plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ ), and  point $x_{0}\in \Gamma$, we denote  $S^{1}(x_{0})$  the circle osculating $\Gamma$ at $ x_0 $. Denote also $ g = \lbrace g_{ij}\rbrace $ and $ h = \lbrace h_{ij}\rbrace  $ the induced metric tensors of $\Gamma$ and  $S^{1}(x_{0})$ respectively, with $ g^{ij} $ and $ h^{ij} $ their inverse matrices and $ G $, $ H $ their determinants. My questions are: Are the values of induced metric tensors $ \lbrace g_{ij} \rbrace$ and $  \lbrace h_{ij} \rbrace $ equal at the point $x_0\in \Gamma$? If yes, does it imply that for any  linear (differential)
  operator defined on a manifold via metric tensor we will have the
  equality again? In particular, the Laplace-Beltrami operator: $
> \forall f \in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2}) $ $$ \Delta_{\Gamma} \,f :=  \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{G}} \partial_{i} \Big(
 \sqrt{G} g^{ij} \partial_{i} \,f \Big) \bigg|_{x=x_{0}}
 \color{red}{\stackrel{(?)}{=}} \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{H}} \partial_{i} \Big(
 \sqrt{H} h^{ij} \partial_{i} \, f \Big) \bigg|_{x=x_{0}}
 =: \Delta_{S^{1}(x_0)}\, f. $$ If the answer for the previous question is yes , would it be possible to estimate the discrepancy of the values of these operators
  within  the $ \varepsilon$-neighborhood of $ x_{0} $? Is it possible to have similar conclusions for the manifolds of higher dimensions? Attempted solutions: Yes. 
Since the both $ g $ and $ h $ are defined as restriction Euclidean metric from $ \mathbb{R}^{2} $ to the tangent spaces of $\Gamma$ and  $S^{1}(x_{0})$, we conclude that $g\big|_{x=x_0} = h\big|_{x=x_0}$ if and only if the tangent spaces of $\Gamma$ and  $S^{1}(x_0)$ coincide at $ x_0 $. 
It follows from the definition of an osculating circle that the unit normal vectors of $\Gamma$ and  $S^{1}(x_{0})$ at $ x_0 $ are equal, so as the tangent vectors. 
Does the equity of tangent vectors imply the equity of tangent planes though? Yes, by definition? 
Or do we need to establish the proximity of operators not only at the point $ x_0 $, but also in some neighborhood? Consider a point $ x_1 \in \Gamma$ such that $ \big|x_0 - x_1\big|<\varepsilon $ for some $ \varepsilon>0 $. 
Given a linear (differential) operator $ \mathcal{F}_{\Omega} $ defined on a manifold $ \Omega $ in terms of its metric tensor, we want to estimate the norm of difference of operators $ \mathcal{F}_{\Gamma} $ and $ \mathcal{F}_{S^{1}(x_{0})} $ at the point $ x_1 $: $$
\bigg\| \mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}\big|_{x_1}  -  \mathcal{F}_{S^{1}(x_{0})}\big|_{x_1} \bigg\| =

	\dfrac{\Big\|  \big[\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}  -  \mathcal{F}_{S^{1}(x_{0})}  \big]\big|_{x_1} f \Big\|}{\| f\|}
\Bigg\rbrace ,
$$
where $ \big[\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}  -  \mathcal{F}_{S^{1}(x_{0})}  \big] \big|_{x_1} f = \big[\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma} \big] \big|_{x_1} f - \big[ \mathcal{F}_{S^{1}(x_{0})}  \big] \big|_{x_1} f $. Here $ \big[\mathcal{F}_{\Gamma} \big] \big|_{x_1} $ and $ \big[ \mathcal{F}_{S^{1}(x_{0})}  \big] f \big|_{x_1} $ denote the operator $ \mathcal{F} $ defined on $ \Gamma $ and  $S^{1}(x_{0}) $ respectively,   estimated at the point $ x_1 $ applied to a function $ f $.
$$
\bigg\| \mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}\big|_{x_1}  -  \mathcal{F}_{S^{1}(x_{0})}\big|_{x_1} \bigg\| \leq
\Big\| \mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}\big|_{x_1}\Big\| + \Big\| \mathcal{F}_{S^{1}(x_{0})}\big|_{x_1} \Big\|
$$ If we assume that the operator $ \mathcal{F} $ is defined as a linear combination of the entries of metric tensor matrix, i.e. $ \mathcal{F} : = a^{ij}g _{ij} $, then the norm $$
\Big\| \mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}\big|_{x_1} \Big\| \leq 
|a^{ij}| \cdot  \big\|g _{ij}({x_1})\big\| = \big| a^{ij}g_{ij}(x_1) \big|, 
\quad i,j = \overline{1,2}.
$$ Since we are talking about Riemannian manifolds, we know that the metric tensor has to vary smoothly from point to point. If $ \Gamma $ can be parametrized in terms of its arclength $ s $ with $ s_0, s_1 $ corresponding to $ x_0,x_1 $ respectively, then we can apply Taylor expansion to every entry of the metric tensor: $$  g_{ij}(s_1) = g_{ij}(s_0)  +  (s_1 - s_0) \cdot  \partial_{s} g_{ij}\big|_{s=s_1} + \frac{1}{2} (s_1 - s_0)^{2} \cdot  \partial_{s}^{2} g_{ij}\big|_{s=s_1} + \dots  
$$
If there exists  a constant $ C>0 $ such that $ |  \partial_{s} g_{ij} | \leq C $ $ \forall i,j = 1,2 $, we get $$
\big\| g_{ij}(s_1)  - g_{ij}(s_0)\big\| = 
C \varepsilon  + \frac{1}{2} C^{2} \varepsilon^{2} + \dots 
\approx \mathcal{O}(C\varepsilon).
$$ If, in addition, we assume the existance of a constant $ A $ s.t. $ a^{ij}\leq A $, then $$
\Big\| \mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}\big|_{x_1} \Big\| \leq 
4 A C\varepsilon, \quad 
\Big\| \mathcal{F}_{S^{1}(x_{0})}\big|_{x_1} \Big\| \leq 4 A C\varepsilon,
$$
so that 
$$
\boxed{
\Big\| \mathcal{F}_{\Gamma}\big|_{x_1}  -  \mathcal{F}_{S^{1}(x_{0})}\big|_{x_1} \Big\| \leq
8 A C \varepsilon
}
$$ Is there a way to obtain similar estimates for a wider class of linear operators $ \mathcal{F} $, and/or with less assumptions on the metric tensor? As for the manifolds of higher dimensions, I assume that we would have to reformulate the problem itself.
For example, in order to generalize the problem for case of 2D surface in 3D Euclidean space we will have to use two principle curvatures and construct something like osculating ellipsoid (perhabs, an oblate spheroid ) with its major and minor axis inverse proportional to the principle curvatures of the manifold. 
Similarly we can go over higher number of dimensions by osculating the manifold with an $ n $-dimensional ball stretched along the principle axis of the manifold.","['smooth-manifolds', 'functional-analysis', 'differential-operators', 'differential-geometry', 'multivariable-calculus']"

I do not think so. I went thus far, as the following indicates. By the mean-value theorem, given $x, y \in A,$ there is a $c$ in the line segment joining $x$ and $y$ such that
$$|f(x) - f(y)| = \big| \nabla f(c)\cdot (x-y) \big| = \bigg| \big[ D_{1}f(c), \dots, D_{n}f(c) \big] \big[ x_{1} - y_{1}, \dots, x_{n} - y_{n} \big]^{\top}\bigg|\\

$$\sum_{1}^{n}\big[ D_{i}f(c) \big]^{2} \leq M.$$
But since $\bigg| \sum_{1}^{n}D_{i}f(c) \bigg|$ need not be less than $\sum_{1}^{n}\big[ D_{i}f(c) \big]^{2}$ and $\bigg| \sum_{1}^{n}(x_{i} - y_{i})\bigg| $ need not be less than $\sum_{1}^{n}(x_{i} - y_{i})^{2},$ so we need not have the desired conclusion, ?","['proof-verification', 'multivariable-calculus']"

1232780,If there is an injection $f: X \to Y$ with $m=n$ then $f$ is a bijection.,"The Statement of the Problem: Let $X,Y$ be finite sets with $ \lvert X \rvert = m $ and $ \lvert Y \rvert = n $. Prove the following statement by induction on $ m \ge 1$: If there is an injection $f: X \to Y$ with $m=n$ then $f$ is a bijection. $(*)$ My Thoughts: I believe I'm supposed to invoke the Schröder-Bernstein theorem here, which I keep thinking I understand... until I have to actually use it in a proof. Furthermore, I always manage to screw up inductive proofs. Also, in simply thinking about the statement, I'm wondering if it is, in fact, even true. For example, is a function from an empty set to an empty set injective? I know that it's not surjective, so it wouldn't be bijective; I'm not sure about injectivity, though. Anyway, here we have the base case, $P(1)$, in which $m=n=1$ which is obviously true. Now, even with the base case here, I understand why it's true, but a formal proof of it is still difficult for me. Would it, perhaps, be useful to use contraposition to make this claim? And, as for the inductive step, I'm not really sure what to do. I know that I am to assume the the hypothesis is true, namely $(*)$, and then show that it's true for $m+1$. But, in order to do that, is the statement of $(*)$ simply the following: If there is an injection $f: X \to Y$ with $m+1=n+1$ then $f$ is a bijection? This is where I feel like I have a fundamental misunderstanding of inductive proofs. So, if anyone could give me some guidance here, I'd appreciate it.

1232862,Lagrange multipliers in Calculus of Variations,"I am trying to learn about Calculus of Variations and I am beginning to see some constrained optimization problems in the domain of functionals, by using Lagrange multipliers. It seems that things work like in the finite-dimensional calculus but I need some semi-formal explanations; which I failed to find anywhere. (Looks like this is a rare area of interest). In the finite dimensional calculus, when we wanted to optimize a function $f(x), f:\mathbb{R^n} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ such that it obeys the constraint $g(x)=0$ , the idea was that $g(x)=0$ was a $n-1$ dimensional surface and $\nabla g(x)$ was normal to the surface's tangent hyperplane. In order to move on the surface, we had to move in directions $u$ where $\nabla g(x)^T \cdot u=0$ . This requires that at a constrained extremum it is needed that $\nabla f(x)^T \cdot u=0$ whenever $\nabla g(x)^T \cdot u=0$ , which requires that $\nabla f(x) = \lambda \nabla g(x)$ . Is this valid in a function space, like $C[a,b]$ as well? Can it be shown that if we have a nice behaving constraint functional $G[y(x)]=0$ in this space, the gradient $\nabla G[y(x)]$ is perpendicular to the function space surface $G[y(x)]=0$ ? We have the inner product $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)g(x)dx$ defined for this space which introduces angles and orthogonality between functions; so I intuitively think that this is true, but I wonder what the actual explanation is. Assuming $1$ is true, can it be said that at a constrained extremum, it should be $\nabla F[y(x)] = \lambda \nabla G[y(x)]$ , like in the finite dimensional case? Does one build a ""Lagrangian functional"" $L[y(x),\lambda]=F[y(x)] + \lambda G[y(x)]$ like in the finite dimensional case, where the problem turns into the unconstrained optimization of the weird thing $L[y(x),\lambda]$ , which depends both on a functional and a scalar variable? How does one maximizes such a thing then: This space is something like $C[a,b] \times \mathbb{R}$ . How are derivatives etc. defined here; for example can we define a Gateaux variation here like $$\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \dfrac{L[y(x) + \epsilon h(x),\lambda + \epsilon] - L[y(x),\lambda]}{\epsilon}$$ which leads to unconstrained optimization? I need some explanations for such cases.","['real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus-of-variations', 'lagrange-multiplier']"

Let $\mathbf{f}(x,y,z) = (zx-y)\mathbf{i}$, where $\mathbf{i}$ is the usual unit vector in the $x$-direction. Verify that Stokes' Theorem is satisfied in this case. So this question is in two parts: I first have to evaluate $\iint_S \nabla \times \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}$, then $\oint_{\partial S}\mathbf{f} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}$, and finally show that they are equal. My Attempt I first calculated $\nabla \times \mathbf{f}$ to be $\begin{vmatrix}\
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k}\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\\
(zx-y) & 0 & 0\\
\end{vmatrix} = (0,x,1).$ I then parameterised the cylinder by $\mathbf{r}(\theta,z) = (\cos\theta,\sin\theta,z)$ , with my normal $\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial \theta} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial z} = (\cos\theta,\sin\theta,0)$ which is outward pointing as required. And my integral becomes $$\begin{align} \int_{\theta = 0} ^{2\pi}\int_{z=0}^{\sqrt{4-\sin^2\theta}}(0,\cos\theta,1)\cdot(\cos\theta,\sin\theta,0)\mathrm{d}z\mathrm{d}\theta & = \int_{\theta = 0} ^{2\pi}\int_{z=0}^{\sqrt{4-\sin^2\theta}}\sin\theta\cos\theta\mathrm{d}z\mathrm{d}\theta\\
& = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\theta = 0} ^{2\pi}\sin2\theta\sqrt{4-\sin^2\theta}\mathrm{d}\theta\end{align}$$ at which point I am stuck.
I think perhaps my parameterisation is wrong, or maybe I have to calculate the surface integrals in two steps, but the latter method didn't seem to work either and I can't find any better parameterisations.

I am interested because if the answer to (A) is no, it can be easily shown that the Kolmogorov formalization/calculus of probability is undermined. This holds because the Kolmogorov calculus seems to require that (A) is true. That the Kolmogorov calculus requires (A) can be easily shown given its axiom of countable additivity, and its theorem: the strong law of large numbers (ie, simply consider that any infinite sequence of independent and identical random variables/trails has probability zero, if the individual outcome probabilities on each trial is less than one). Even if non-standard analysis is applied (so that infinite sequences composed of individual independent and identical random variable with non zero probability are assigned infinitesimal probability values, rather then zero probability values), it appears that this result (ie (A)) is demanded by the Kolmogorov calculus","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'number-theory', 'real-analysis', 'combinatorics']"

$$\ln \phi(t) = \int_a^t \frac{\gamma'(s)}{\gamma(s)-z} \,\textrm{d}s \textrm{ implies } (\ln \phi(t))' = \frac{\phi'(t)}{\phi(t)} = \dots = \frac{\gamma'(t)}{\gamma(t) - z}.$$
