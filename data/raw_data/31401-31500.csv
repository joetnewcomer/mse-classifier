295297,Weighted Standard Deviation for Histogram Bin Height,"I'm plotting some binned data in the form of a histogram. Say I have 10 data points, each composed of a bin to be placed in, and then a ""height"". Then I might have something like: Bin   Height 0   - 2.2 1   - 1.3 2   - 0.1 0   - 2.4 2   - 0.28 1   - 0.8 0   - 1.8 1   - 1.0 0   - 2.6 0   - 2.2 I want to plot this, with the height of each bin being the sum of the heights of the pieces in each bin (so above, the full height of bin 2 would be 0.38). I'd like to find the standard deviation in the height of a bin. I know that my sample is drawn from a uniform distribution, but set up so that 0 is more likely than 2, since the range in the uniform distribution that corresponds to 0 is wider than that for 2. I know these ranges. The heights aren't generated using the uniform distribution. Update: how I get the heights - I start off with everyone in some bin, say 0, with each person having height 1. Then through some process, I get probabilities to move each one into another bin: Bin to move to:  Weight to move: 0                1 1                0.4 2                0.2 So then I add these heights up to get 1.6 or something, and use my uniform distribution to move to another bin (or stay in 0, depending on what I get). Then the ""height"" of the person is 1.6. If I do this update procedure multiple times, the total height is the product of these sums for each step. I want to add up all these total heights for everyone in the bin, and get a standard deviation on that so I'd have something like 0 - 11.2 +/- ?? 1 - 3.1 +/- ?? 2 - 0.38 +/- ??","['statistics', 'standard-deviation']"

This makes me wonder about classifying compact Riemannian 2-manifolds up to isometry.  In particular: Is there a classification of all Riemannian 2-manifolds that are diffeomorphic to the 2-sphere? I imagine this to be a very difficult question.  As such, I have two follow-up questions: If this is a tractable question, how much progress has been made in this direction?

295309,"Are the Ricci and Scalar curvatures the only ""interesting"" tensors coming from the Riemannian curvature tensor?","In studying Riemannian geometry, one learns about the Riemann curvature tensor
$$Rm(X,Y,Z,W) = \langle \nabla_X\nabla_YZ -\nabla_Y\nabla_XZ - \nabla_{[X,Y]}Z, W\rangle$$
and its various symmetries.  From the Riemann curvature tensor, one can define the Ricci and scalar curvatures, which give us ""pieces"" of the curvature. I understand that both the Ricci and scalar curvatures are important ways of measuring curvature. My question is: are these (in any sense) the ""only"" interesting tensors that come from the Riemann curvature? That is, I could imagine inventing other curvature tensors by performing various operations on $Rm$.  Is there a reason that doing so would be fruitless?  Why do we privilege the Ricci and Scalar curvatures?  Do they give us all the information that we might want?

295320,Which Algebraic Properties Distinguish Lie Groups from Abstract Groups?,"This question is motivated by a previous one: Conditions for a smooth manifold to admit the structure of a Lie group , and wants to be a sort of ""converse"". Here I am taking an abstract group $G$ and looking for necessary conditions for it to admit the structure of a Lie group. Of course I am thinking of structures with underlying manifold not $0$-dimensional (since every group can be given the discrete topology this wouldn't be interesting). In the mentioned question they take a manifold, put a group structure on it and look at the constraints this imposes on its ""geometric structure"" (homotopy, co-homology, bundles...); so here I want to take a group, put a manifold structure over it and find constraints on its ""algebraic structure"" (subgroups, quotients, representation, whatever...). In this question: Given a group $ G $, how many topological/Lie group structures does $ G $ have? there is a wonderful answer which addresses the problem of existence and uniqueness of Lie structure on a topological group. But this is not what I'm looking for, because there it is assumed a priori that $G$ admits the structure of a topological group; then this structure is ""smoothened"" to obtain a Lie structure. What I want to do is to start with a $G$ without any topological structure. So my question could also be rephrased as: Which algebraic properties distinguish Lie groups from abstract groups? To be explicit, the no-small-subgroups property quoted in the second question is the kind of things I'm looking for.","['topological-groups', 'manifolds', 'lie-groups', 'differential-topology', 'group-theory']"

While trying to expand this function into the Laurent series, convergent in $P(0,1,2):=\lbrace z\in\mathbb{C}:1<|z|<2\rbrace$ , a few questions popped into my mind. We can write $f(z)=\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{(z-1)^2}+\frac{1}{(z+1)^2}\right)$ . Both functions inside parentheses are complex derivatives of functions which have immediate Laurent series expansion: $\frac{1}{1-z}$ and $-\frac{1}{z+1}$ . Now, can we differentiate the obtained series term by term to get the desired expansion of $f$ ? If so, is it because the Laurent series is convergent almost uniformly?

295358,How are infinite-dimensional manifolds most commonly treated?,"At a summer school I recently attended, infinite-dimensional manifolds popped up.

Proof Let $G$ be a cyclic group generated by "" $a$ "" and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ . If $H = {\{e\}}$ , then $H = \langle e\rangle $ is cyclic. If $H \neq \space {\{e\}}$ , then $a^n \in H$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ . Let $m$ be the smallest integer in $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ such that $a^m \in H$ . We claim that $c = a^m$ generates $H$ ; that is, $$H = \langle a^m\rangle =  \langle c\rangle.$$ We must show that every $b \in H$ is a power of $c$ . Since $b \in H$ and $H \leq G$ , we have $b = a^n$ for some $n$ . Find $q$ and $r$ such that $$ n = mq + r \space \space \space \space for \space \space \space 0 \leq r < m,$$ Alright this is the first part in the proof where I start to get confused. Where does the division algorithm come from and why are we using it? The proof continues as follows: $$a^n = a^{mq + r} = (a^m)^q \cdot a^r,$$ so $$ a^r = (a^m)^{-q} \cdot a^n.$$ Now since $a^n \in H$ , $a^m \in H$ , and $H$ is a group, both $(a^m)^{-q}$ and $a^n$ are in $H$ . Thus $$(a^m)^{-q} \cdot a^n \in H; \space \space \space \text{that is,} \space \space a^r \in H.$$ This is another point at which I’m a little confused. What exactly about $a^n$ and $a^m$ being elements of $H$ allows us to accept that $(a^m)^{-q}$ and $a^{n}$ are in $H$ ? The proof continues: Since $m$ was the smallest positive integer such that $a^m \in H$ and $0$ $\leq r$ $< m$ , we must have $r = 0$ . Thus $n = qm$ and $$b \space = \space a^n \space = \space (a^m)^q \space = \space c^q,$$ so $b$ is a power of $c.$ This final step is confusing as well, but I think its just because of the previous parts I was confused about.

From previous exercises the coordinate system on $T^*M$ is of the form $(q^1,..,q^n,p_1,...,p_n)$, and to prove the assertion, the authors use the coordinates expression of $\Omega=dp_i\wedge dq^i$ and note that the tangent space to the fibres of $p$ is locally spanned by $\frac{\partial}{\partial p_i}$ . So my questions are: How is $\Omega$ defined on the submanifold ? Is it restricted in some specific way, and what would the coordinate expression of this restriction be ? If not, is there a meaning  for the expression
$\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}$ on the fibres as submanifolds ?
Because on a given fibre, all $q^i$ are constant, so you can't apply
derivatives along $q^i$ to functions defined on those submanifolds. And, ultimately this would give me the meaning of $dq^i$ and how to apply it to prove the non degenerate nature of $\Omega$ on the fibres.","['differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"

Now my question is: if a topological dynamical system $(X,T)$ is proximal, is the product system $(X\times X,T\times T)$ also proximal? Note that to show that $(X\times X,T\times T)$ is proximal we need to prove that for two points $(x_1,x_2)$ and $(y_1,y_2)$ in $X\times X$ are proximal, i.e. for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists an positive integer $n$ such that $d((T^nx_1,T^nx_2),(T^ny_1,T^ny_2))<\epsilon$. Since $X$ is proximal, we know that $x_1$ and $y_1$ are proximal and $y_1$ and $y_2$ are proximal. So there exists an positive integer $n_1$ such that $$d(T^{n_1}x_1,T^{n_1}y_1)<\epsilon$$ and an positive integer $n_2$ such that $$d(T^{n_2}x_2,T^{n_2}y_2)<\epsilon.$$ But that is not enough, since to show that $X\times X$ is proximal we need to show there exists a uniform $n$, which means that we

296004,Show that an equivalence relation is equal to the union of the cartesian product of its equivalence classes,"Given an equivalence relation $\sim$ with equivalence classes $C_1,\dots,C_n$ , show that $$\mathbin{\sim} = \bigcup_{j=1}^n\bigcup_{i=1}^n(C_j\times C_i)\;.$$ I could use a hint on where to start approaching this from. The beginnings of my proof: Suppose that $\langle a,b \rangle\in\sim$ .  This implies that $a\sim b$ , and by the symmetry of $\sim$ , $b\sim a$ .  The equivalence classes of $a$ and $b$ are defined $\bar{a}=\{b\in A | a\sim b\}$ and $\bar{b}=\{a\in A | b\sim a\}$ .  It follows from the properties of the equivalence relation that $a\sim b\iff \bar{a}=\bar{b}$ . $\bar{a}=\bar{b}\implies \{b\in A | a\sim b\}=\{a\in A | b\sim a\}$ . Now suppose that $\langle a,b\rangle\in\bigcup_{i=1}^n(C_i\times C_i)$ .  This means there exists $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$ such that $\langle a,b \rangle\in C_i\times C_i$ .  Consequently, $\langle a,b \rangle\in C_i\times C_i\implies a\in C_i$ and $b\in C_i$ .","['equivalence-relations', 'discrete-mathematics', 'elementary-set-theory']"
296035,Martingale and bounded stopping time,"A theorem of submartingale and bounded stopping time says: Theorem 5.4.1. If $X_n$ is a submartingale and $N$ is a stopping time with $\mathbb P (N \le 
k) = 1$ then $\mathbb EX_0 ≤ \mathbb EX_N ≤ \mathbb EX_k$. An exercise for this theorem is Example 5.4.1. Random walks. If we let $S_n = \xi_1 + · · · + \xi_n$ where the $ξ_m$
  are independent and have $\mathbb E \xi_m = 0$, $\sigma_m^2 = \mathbb E \xi_m^2 < \infty$. Suppose we have that $|\xi_m | \le K$ and let $s^2_n = \sum_{m \le n} \sigma^2_m$. Note that $S_n^2 − s^2_n$ is a martingale. Use this fact and Theorem 5.4.1 to conclude 
  $$\mathbb P \left(\max_{1 \le m \le n} |S_m| ≤ x \right) ≤ (x + K)^2/ \mathbb E(S_n^2)$$ Let $A = \{\max_{1 \le m \le n} |S_m| ≤ x\}$. Let $X_n = S^2_n - s^2_n$. Let $N = \inf\{m:|S_m| \ge x~\text{or}~n+1\}$. So $N$ is a bounded stopping time. Thus by the previous theorem we have
$$
0 = \mathbb E{X_1} = \mathbb E{X_N} = \mathbb E{X_{n+1}}.
$$
Since $X_{n+1} = X_N$ on $A^c$, we have $\mathbb E (X_{n+1} 1_A) = \mathbb E (X_N 1_A)$. Therefore, as long as we have $\mathbb E (X_N 1_A) \ge 0$, (which I don't know how to prove), we have $\mathbb E (X_{n+1} 1_A) \ge 0$. It follows that
$$
\mathbb E(s_n^2 1_A) \le \mathbb E(s_{n+1}^2 1_A) \le \mathbb E(S_{n+1}^2 1_A) \le (x + K)^2.
$$
But I have problem to show that $\mathbb E(X_N 1_A) \ge 0$. Am I on the right direction?","['probability-theory', 'martingales']"

296047,Order of general linear group of $2 \times 2$ matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_3$,"From problem 2.3.25 in Topics in Algebra , 2$\varepsilon$ by I. N. Herstein: Let $G$ be the group of all $2 \times 2$ matrices $\left(\begin{array}{c c}a & b \\ c & d\end{array}\right)$ where $ad-bc \ne 0$ and $a,b,c,d$ are integers modulo 3, relative to matrix multiplication. Show that $o(G) = 48$. I know that $o(G) \le 3^4 = 81$, since $a,b,c,d$ can each take one of 3 values (mod 3). I attempted to tighten this bound by finding the number of matrices such that $ad=bc$ (mod 3): Suppose $ad=bc=0$ (mod 3). Then ($a = 0$ or $d = 0$) and ($b = 0$ or $c = 0$), leading to 36 possible values for $(a,b,c,d)$. Suppose $ad=bc=1$ (mod 3). Then ($a=d=1$ or $a=d=2$) and ($b=c=1$ or $b=c=2$), leading to 4 possible values for $(a,b,c,d)$. Suppose $ad=bc=2$ (mod 3). Then ($(a,d)=(1,2)$ or $(a,d)=(2,1)$) and ($(b,c)=(1,2)$ or $(b,c)=(2,1)$), leading to 4 possible values for $(a,b,c,d)$. So, there are in total $36+4+4 = 44$ such $\left(\begin{array}{c c}a & b \\ c & d\end{array}\right)$ where $ad-bc=0$ (mod 3). That means there are at most $81-44 = 37$ such $\left(\begin{array}{c c}a & b \\ c & d\end{array}\right)$ where $ad-bc\ne 0$, i.e., $o(G) \le 37$. However, this contradicts the problem.

296082,cross product and RHR,"Edit : I really like the approach taken by $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the comments below. I posted this late last night and didn't get to ask him why $\bf R(a \times b) = Ra \times Rb$ for any rotation matrix $\bf R$. I'm not sure how to prove that: along with trying to evaluate the determinant directly, I looked in a linear algebra book and tried using the ""norm-preserving"" property of rotation matrices to evaluate $|\bf R(a \times b) - R(a) - R(b)|$ $^2$, but didn't succeed. How do you do this? In one of my courses, a professor briefly summarized properties of the cross product at the start of last class. I realized that the assertion $$ \bf a \times (b + c) = a\times b + a\times c$$ was actually surprising to me. Clearly this is fundamental (if you don't accept this, you can't derive a way of computing the cross product), but the proof is a bit slippery. If you start from $\bf{ a \times  b}$ $:= \bf \hat n |a||b|$ $ \sin\theta$, where $ \bf \hat n$ comes from the right hand rule, then if you can prove as a lemma $\bf a \cdot (b \times c) = (a \times b) \cdot c$, then there's a neat little proof which I found here . But the only argument I've seen for the needed lemma is about the volume of a parallelepiped, which only convinces me that $\bf | a \cdot (b \times c)| = |(a \times b) \cdot c|$. I think I prefer the approach in one of my textbooks, which starts by defining the cross product by determinants - so, distributivity holds - and proves most of the needed properties. But it wusses out at a crucial point: ""it can be proven that the orthogonal vector obtained from this matrix obeys the Right Hand Rule"". Could somebody either prove that lemma, or the textbook claim? (Preferably the latter.)","['multivariable-calculus', 'linear-algebra']"
