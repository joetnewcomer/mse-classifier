2233222,proving a double integral indentity,"Numerical integration suggests that the following identity holds for any $\lambda>0$:

2233344,An analytical proof for the punctured plane is not simply connected?,"I am trying to make a ""challenge problem"" for my (undergraduate) real analysis students. Currently, the students knows about connectedness, compactness in $\mathbb R^n$, functional limits and continuous functions from $\mathbb R^m$ to $\mathbb R^n$. They are also familiar with all the standard real analysis results on $\mathbb R$. The goal for this problem is to show that the punctured plane is not simply connected. I set up the problem by defining the terms ""path"", ""loop"", ""path homotopy"", and ""null-homotopic"". But I could not come up with a proof accessible to real analysis students showing that the path parameterized by $\alpha(t)
 = (\cos(2 \pi t),\sin(2 \pi t))$ is NOT null-homotopic. Can someone help? Things I definitely want to avoid: fundamental groups, Brouwer fixed point theorem, residue theorem. Things I wish to avoid: There is a proof using Green's theorem, which I guess has the same flavor as the residue theorem in complex analysis. I think this is something students are able to understand. But since we have not talked about vector calculus in this course, it would be better if the proof I write down as solution does not involve Green's theorem.",['real-analysis']

And I found that most of the solutions used the fact that if the linear map $B$ is one-one then it must be onto. But this fact appears trivial because of $AB = I$. Consider the equation $Bx = y$ and if there are two solutions $x, x'$ then $Bx = Bx' = y$ by multiplying by $A$ on left we get $x = x'$. This is what is referred to as $B$ is one-one. But the same argument also shows that $x = x' = Ay$ so that $B$ is onto (for each $y$ we have found $x = Ay$). I wonder why do the proofs in the linked question used some linear-algebra to show that $B$ is onto. It appears that most proofs use the left multiplication by $A$ to ensure that $x = x'$ but somehow this does not seem to guarantee $x = Ay$. Why is that the case? Or am I missing something? Update : Thanks to all those who replied. I got hold of my mistake. The argument proves that if $Bx = y$ has a solution it must be $x = Ay$. It does not show that there is a solution. Sorry to bother you all for such trivial matter (and if all agree I may delete this silly question). Existence of a left inverse of $B$ does not guarantee the solution of $Bx  = y$. Rather it is the existence of right inverse of $B$ which is needed here to get a solution.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'proof-explanation']"

If you take the logarithm of this equations, $$ \ln(y_i) = \sum_{\{j\}} \ln(x_j) $$ which can be written as $$  \ln(y_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij} \ln(x_j) $$ where $A_{ij}$ is a term that is either $0$ or $1$ depending on whether the corresponding $x_j$ showed up in the product above.

2233713,choosing two sets that intersect every given subset in the same amount of points,"I was given the following question in a course on the probabilistic method.

  can find some $X,Y \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ so that $X\ne Y$ and
  for all $1\le i \le k$ we have $|X\cap S_i| = |Y\cap S_i|$. I noted that we can assume that $\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}S_i = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ because if not we can simply take $X = \emptyset, Y = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^{k}S_i$ and then $|X\cap S_i| = |Y\cap S_i|=0$.

2233933,Rows of a matrix over an arbitrary ring,"I didn't know what to put on my search query so it's possible that this has already been asked before. If so, please give me a link to the answer and I'll delete this question. In linear algebra over fields, it is easy to see that if a matrix has more columns than rows, then there is a nontrivial relation between the columns. This result is easily expandable to commutative integral domains, since they can be embedded into fields, and I would think that proving the same result for division rings and hence for any integral domains in general wouldn't be such a problem. However I have read somewhere that this holds for matrices over arbitrary rings, but couldn't find a proof. Intuitively, this seems normal because removing integrity causes more things to be zero, more easily (for instance if the ring has trivial multiplication, then this is obviously true), and so should make creating non trivial relations easier. But when the ring is not ""regular"" enough, a theory of dimension over this ring is harder to put into place and so it wouldn't have surprised me that this result were actually false. So my question is : is this theorem true for arbitrary rings, and if so, how do you prove it ?","['matrices', 'abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'linear-algebra']"

2234070,Simple Connectedness of bounded region in $\mathbb{C}$ split by line,"Note: This is one of the problems from Complex Analysis by Stein and Shakarchi. Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$ be a bounded region (open, connected), and let $L \subset \mathbb{C}$ be a line that intersects $\Omega$, you may assume that $\Omega \cap L = I$ is an interval. The line $L$ splits the complex plane in two halves, and since $\Omega$ is open, $\Omega$ will have a nonempty intersection with each half. Let's call these intersections $\Omega_l$ and $\Omega_r$. In particular, $\Omega$ will be the disjoint union $\Omega_l \cup I \cup \Omega_r$. To prove: If $\Omega_l$ and $\Omega_r$ are simply connected, then so is $\Omega$. Intuitively, this seems rather obvious: if $\Omega_l$ and $\Omega_r$ ""have no holes"", then $\Omega$ can't have any holes either. However, proving this rigorously has me stumped. There seem to be a few possible approaches here: Use the following theorem/lemma: A bounded region is simply connected if and only if its complement is connected. This gives us that $\Omega^c \cup I \cup \Omega_l$ and $\Omega^c \cup I \cup \Omega_r$ are both connected, and that it suffices to prove that $\Omega^c$ is connected. I don't see how any of these help, though. Use the definition of simple connectedness: An open set is simply connected if any two curves with the same initial and final points inside the set are homotopic. We could take two curves inside $\Omega$ and try to deform one into the other. Inside $\Omega_l$ and $\Omega_r$ we can deform curves easily, but when they intersect $I$ I can't figure out how to do it. Use the winding number: A bounded region $\Omega$ is simply connected if and only if $W_\gamma(z) = 0$ for any closed curve $\gamma$ in $\Omega$ and any point $z \notin \Omega$. Ideally, we would take any curve $\gamma$ in $\Omega$ and somehow split this into two curves $\gamma_l, \gamma_r$ in $\Omega_l$ and $\Omega_r$ respectively, then write the winding number $W_\gamma(z)$ in terms of the winding numbers of these new curves. But, once again, I can't figure out how to handle this when $\gamma$ and $I$ intersect. Any hints, suggestions or solutions are appreciated.","['homotopy-theory', 'connectedness', 'complex-analysis', 'winding-number', 'general-topology']"

I am also trying to apply this to other concepts I have learned. Is $X$ open? X is open if every $x \in X$ is an interior point. Take an arbitrary $p \in X$ so that $p = (p_x, p_y)$ then $p_x > 0$ and $p_y = sin(1/p_x)$. Define an open ball $B_r(p)$, and take $q \in B_r(p)$ be an arbitrary point. Is $q \in X$? Is it possible for $q$ to not be in X? Since $y = sin(1/x)$ is defined and is continuous for all $x \neq 0$,then there will always exist a $q_y = sin(1/q_x)$, provided $q_x \neq 0$. How do I know $q_x \neq 0$? Otherwise, I propose that X is open. Alternatively, X is open if whenever $f: \mathbb{R^2 \to R}$ is continuous and $U \subseteq R$ so that if $U$ is open, then $f^{-1}(U)$ is also open. Could I construct such a $U$ to prove that it's open? My only concern is that if $U = (-1,1)$, then $f^{-1}(U) = (-\infty, \infty) = \mathbb{R}$ which is not open nor closed. Is $X$ closed? I am not sure about this one. I want to say that is not closed, since $X^c$ is not open. It is not open because $(0,0)$ defines a boundary point which lies in the set $X^c$.

2234230,Why do we want or need cross-norms on tensor products?,"If $(E, \|\cdot\|_1),(F, \|\cdot\|_2)$ are Banach spaces, their (algebraic) tensor product $E \otimes F$ is a vector space looking forward to be normed. A norm on a tensor product of vector spaces is called cross-norm if it behaves multliplicative on elementary tensors, i.e. for all $x \in E, y \in F$ we have $$
\|x \otimes y\| = \|x\|_1 \|y\|_2. \tag{1}
$$ Prominent examples of cross-norms are the projective $\pi$ and injective $\varepsilon$ tensor product. In my lecture notes I found that it is preferable to use cross-norms on tensor products. Somewhere else I found that one wants cross-norms since they are compatible with convergent sequences. This last staement does not convince me since I find it more natural to require only $$
\|x \otimes y\| \leq \|x\|_1 \|y\|_2 \tag{2}.
$$ I think we all agree that a useful norm on a tensor product should fulfill (2): If $x_n \to x$ and $y_n \to y$ , inequality $(2)$ implies that $x_n \otimes y_n \to x \otimes y$ . I have yet to find some occasion where I really need a norm fulfilling (1) and just (2) being not enough. What do you think: Are cross-norms not only pretty but indispensable? . This should be taken care of by the addition I provided below: It seems natural to want the algebraic tensor product of the duals to be ""included"" in the dual of the algebraic tensor product, i.e. $E^* \otimes F^* \subseteq (E \otimes^\sim F)^*$ (if we identify a functional $\varphi \otimes \psi$ with its continuous extension to the completion $\cdot^\sim$ of $E \otimes F$ w.r.t. the cross-norm) although I am not capable of anticipating the consequences if this inclusion does not hold: What are the downsides of not having this inclusion? -- Is it reasonable not to use reasonable cross-norms ? I think that $E^* \otimes F^*$ can be a nice point separating subspace of $(E \otimes^\sim F)^*$ but I am not sure about it. Can you provide examples of important norms for tensor products (of Banach spaces) that aren't (reasonable) cross-norms? Some more thoughts: Looking at Ryan's Introduction to Tensor Products p.127, reasonable norms on $E \otimes F$ are cross-norms in the sense of (1): Let $(E,\|\cdot\|_1$ and $(F, \|\cdot\|_2)$ be Banach spaces. A norm $\|\cdot\|_\alpha$ on $E \otimes F$ is called reasonable cross-norm if Inequality (2) holds. For all $\varphi \in E^*$ and $\psi \in Y^*$ , the linear functional $\varphi \otimes \psi$ on $X \otimes Y$ is bounded with operator norm $$
\|\varphi \otimes \psi\| \leq \|\varphi\| \|\psi\|.
$$ Then, in proposition 6.1 it is proved that each reasonable cross-norm fulfills (1) automatically. In Category theory, there seems to be the concept of uniform cross norms , see nLab but from the definition there it is not clear why they call it uniform cross norm and not just uniform tensor product norm or something else.","['tensor-products', 'banach-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'category-theory', 'topological-vector-spaces']"

To apply the alternating series test, I would need to argue that $\frac{1}{n^{1+\frac{1}{n}}}$ is decreasing with limit zero.

The first few of them have the following prime number factorizations: ($c_1=c_3=c_4=1)$ 
$$\begin{aligned}
c_6&=2^2\\
c_7&=5\\
c_9&=11 \times 7\\
c_{10}&=13\times 2^3\\

c_{15}&=23\times17\times13\\
c_{16}&=19\times11\times7\times5

In particular, it seems that the same prime number never appears in two consecutive $c_n$.
Can we find the general pattern? EDIT 2 : Let us apply the Lagrange inversion theorem, as suggested by Simply Beautiful Art in the comments. Our equation can be rewritten as
$$
f(x)=\epsilon,\qquad \text{ where }\qquad f(x)\equiv\frac{1-x^3}{x},
$$
and the unperturbed equation reads $f(1)=0$; then
$$\boxed{
x(\epsilon)= 1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{g_n}{n!}\epsilon^n
}
$$
and the coefficients are given by 
$$\begin{aligned}
g_n &= \lim_{x\to 1}\left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^{n-1}\left(\frac{x-1}{f(x)}\right)^n\\
&=(-1)^n \left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)^{n-1} \left(\frac{x}{1+x+x^2}\right)^n_{x=1}\\
&=(-1)^n \left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^{n-1} \left(\frac{t+1}{3+3t+t^2}\right)^n_{t=0}.
\end{aligned}$$
To calculate these derivatives, let us expand the functions appearing on the right-hand side as follows using the geometric series expansion for small $t$ and Newton's binomial formula:
$$\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{t+1}{3+3t+t^2}\right)^n
&=\frac{(t+1)^n}{3^n}\frac{1}{\left[1+\left(t+\dfrac{t^2}{3}\right)\right]^n}\\
&=\frac{(t+1)^n}{3^n}\sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \binom{n-1+k}{k} \left(t+\frac{t^2}{3}\right)^k\\
&=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \sum_{i=0}^k \sum_{j=0}^n \frac{(-1)^k}{3^{n+i}}\binom{n+k-1}{k}\binom{k}{i}\binom{n}{j}t^{k+i+j}.
\end{aligned}$$
Now the differentiation is easy:
$$
\left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^{n-1}t^{k+i+j}\bigg|_{t=0}=\frac{(k+i+j)!}{(k+i+j-n+1)!}\delta_{k+i+j,n-1}.
$$
We can use the Kronecker delta to get rid of the summation over $j$: we set $j=n-1-i-k$ as long as this value falls within the summation range
$$
0\le n-1-i-k \le n
$$
which in turn imposes $i\le n-1-k$ and $k\le n-1$. After a few algebraic simplifications, 
$$\boxed{
g_n=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-1)^{n-k}(n-1+k)!\sum_{i=0}^{\min(k,n-1-k)}\binom{n}{1+k+i}\frac{1}{3^{n+i}i!(k-i)!}.
}
$$
Is there a way to compute the radius of convergence of the above series?
A rough estimate is given by plugging $k,i\mapsto n/2$ which radius
$\rho=2$, but surely a more refined analysis is possible. Numerical evaluations of $1/\lim |g_n/n!|^{1/n}$ suggest that the convergence radius should be strictly less than $2$.","['recurrence-relations', 'roots', 'sequences-and-series', 'perturbation-theory']"
2234553,"If an infinite sequence has no last element, why do we say the $\sqrt2$ is irrational?","The arguments I've seen for certain square roots being irrational (like $\sqrt2$) boil down to proving by contradiction that if we assume p/q to be fully reduced we'll find that both p and q must be even (in the case of $\sqrt2$) and :boom: contradiction. But if I allow p to have an infinite number of digits (a valid member of the integers) then it has no last digit and cannot be classified as even or odd. Right? The proof by infinite descent, for example, seems to assume we can't descend infinitely but why not? I must be missing something important here about the integers. Similarly, why not define pi as the fraction 314159.../100000...? I believe both are valid integers. I've often heard people loosely describe rational numbers as the set of numbers whose decimal representations terminate or repeat, but I don't see what limits the construction of an arbitrarily large integer by an infinite process. Lets for example attempt to construct the numerator in the quotient above: Step 1: Construct the number 3 (1+1+1 = 3) Step 2: Construct 31 (3+1+1...+1 = 28) Step 3: Construct 314 (you get the idea) It seems I could continue the process above indefinitely and produce a valid integer at every step. Because it is an infinite process any one step has a finite integer, but the number this process describes is unlimited. Is the number this process describes then not an integer? Update As commenters and answerers of this question have pointed out, my question assumes that a number with an infinite number of digits could be called an integer. That underlying assumption has confused some readers of my question so I've edited the above in an attempt to make the meat of my question clearer. To that end, I'd like to point out that the essence of my question is either very similar to or a duplicate of A ""number"" with an infinite number of digits is a natural number? .","['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'irrational-numbers']"

If $u(x,y)$ is constant then $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=0$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=0$ therefore the riemann cauchy equations $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=-\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$ therefore $v(x,y)$ must also be constant which in turn means that f has to be constant, since $u(x,y),v(x,y)$ are constant
Can anyone confirm if my approach for part (a) is correct? Part (b) Show that the function $z\mapsto \overline {f(\bar{z})}$ is entire. My attempt 
 First calculating what $\overline {f(\bar{z})}$ looks like,
$f(\bar {z})=u(x,y)-iv(x,-y)$ therefore $$\overline {f(\bar{z})}=-u(x,y)+iv(x,-y)$$  i tried next to check if this satisfies the riemann cauchy equations but they dont so maybe i've made a mistake in my working of calculating $\overline {f(\bar{z})}$ Part (c) Let $D(0;1):=\{(x,y)\in \Bbb R^2:x+iy\in D(0;1)\}$ denote the open unit disk. Consider the function $g:D(0;1)\to \Bbb C$ defined by $$g(z):=\frac{1}{1-z}$$ $\forall z \in \Bbb C$ , we also denote $$E:=\{(x,y)\in \Bbb R^2:x+iy\in D(0;1)\}$$ The question is to find the functions $u,v:E\to \Bbb R$ such that $g(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$ $\forall (x,y)\in E$
 My attempt:
 $$g(z)=\frac{1}{1-z}=\frac{1}{1-(x+iy)}=\frac{1}{1-x-iy}$$ I have gotten stuck here can i split this fraction up to calculate $u(x,y)$,$v(x,y)$.

2234587,Can a number be a palindrome in 4 consecutive number bases?,"Edit $(2020)$ : Update is included at the end of the post. $4$ consecutive bases? Are there numbers that are a palindrome in $4$ consecutive number bases? I'm not counting a one digit palindrome as a palindrome. (Discarding trivial solutions.) After testing some of my plots of palindromic numbers & number systems, I noticed that I couldn't find any numbers which are a palindrome in more than $3$ consecutive bases. I was curious to find out why is this the case. I ran a simple code to check numbers up to $10^{7}$ (and all relevant bases), and didn't find any numbers that are a palindrome in $4$ or more consecutive bases. For reference, here are the smallest numbers which are palindromic in $1,2,3$ consecutive bases: $$3 = 11_2$$ $$10 = 101_3=22_4$$ $$178 = 454_6 =343_7 = 262_8$$ For example, $3=1\cdot 2^1 + 1\cdot 2^0=11_2$ is a binary palindrome. I strongly suspect that a solution for four consecutive bases does not exits, but I do not know how to prove this observation. For comparison, there are infinitely many numbers that are palindromic in $3$ consecutive number bases. Almost $4$ consecutive bases Lets examine numbers which are ""almost palindromic in four consecutive bases"" . That is, the numbers palindromic in bases $b$ and $b+3$ , and in either $b+1$ or $b+2$ number base. Checking separately some $d$ digit palindromes up to some number base $b$ , I found: ( $b\le6000$ ) For $2$ digits, there are no examples. ( $b\le900$ ) For $3$ digits, there are $1484$ examples . ( $b\le800$ ) For $4$ digits, there is only one example at $b=10$ . ( $b\le150$ ) For $5$ digits, only two examples at $b=16$ and at $b=17$ ( $b\le100$ ) For $6$ digits, there are no examples. And etc. Notice that other than the three exceptions, all other palindromes (examples) of this type have exactly $3$ digits in their palindromic bases. If we can prove this observation, then our solution should have exactly $3$ digits in its palindromic bases. This in fact would solve the problem, because $3$ digit numbers cannot be palindromic in more than $3$ consecutive number bases. That is, Two smallest three digit numbers that are a palindrome in three consecutive are: $$178 = 454_6 =343_7 = 262_8$$ $$300 = 606_7 = 454_8 = 363_9$$ All other three digit palindromes which are palindromic in three consecutive number bases are given by (Also mentioned in the OEIS sequence) the following expression using $n\ge7$ and is odd : $$\frac{1}{2}(n^3 + 6n^2 + 14n + 11)$$ Each term given by this is palindromic in bases $n+1, n+2, n+3$ and is $3$ digits long. $373$ is the first number given by this equation, and is palindromic in bases $8,9,10$ . This three digit pattern will never extend to a fourth consecutive base as TMM said in the comments; which Ross Millikan posted later in his partial answer. It remains to prove the observation that ""almost 4 consecutive base palindromes"" can't have more than $3$ digits if they are sufficiently large. This was also cross-posted on Math Overflow , with patterns for $5$ and $7$ digits also presented there; but nothing new came up so far. Update Thanks to Max Alekseyev's method , we know that if a palindrome in $4$ consecutive number bases exists, then either: It has an equal number of digits in all corresponding number bases and also has $15$ or more digits in those number bases (see this answer and corresponding OEIS sequence A323742 ). It does not have an equal number of digits in corresponding bases and is larger than $10^{12}$ (i.e. is a term of the OEIS sequence A327810 .)

Vinogradov reads: Prove that there exist an infinite number of primes by counting the number of integers, not exceeding $N$, whose canonical decomposition does not contain prime numbers different from $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_k$. This makes it seem as though both $N$ and $\{p_1, p_2, ..., p_k\}$ should be arbitrary.  However, if both are arbitrary, then the numbers whose canonical decomposition includes only $\{p_1, p_2, ..., p_k\}$ could easily exhaust the integers not exceeding $N$. I decided to let $\{p_1, p_2, ..., p_k\}$ be arbitrary, fixed $N = max(\{p_1, p_2, ..., p_k\})^2$, and worked from there, but I wonder if this is what Vinogradov had in mind.

One can directly apply the prime number theorem to show that if $p_n$ is the sequence of prime numbers, the limit $\lim_{n\to\infty}p_{n+1}/p_n$ exists (and equals $1$). I'm wondering whether one can show existence of this limit without appealing to the prime number theory, and I'd be especially happy if there's an elegant elementary proof. Given that my current guess is that such a proof is not too likely to exist, I'd also be happy to know what the core obstacles are.

2235028,"Doubt regarding proof that $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}[x]$ are unique factorization domains","The usual proof for unique factorization in $\mathbb{Z}$ proceeds via the concept of GCD (greatest common divisor) of two integers leading to the fundamental property of primes in $\mathbb{Z}$ : Theorem : If $p$ is prime and $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $p\mid ab$ then either $p\mid a$ or $p\mid b$ . And this is the result which guarantees uniqueness of factorization. Note that the same procedure does not apply in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ as we don't have a concept of GCD here. Thus for example we can't say that $2, x$ have GCD $1$ because we can't find polynomials $p(x), q(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that $$1 = 2p(x) + xq(x)$$ (contradiction arises when we put $x = 0$ in above equation). The problem is eliminated by considering polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ and then we have the GCD available here so that $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is a unique factorization domain. Next we use the fact that $\mathbb{Z}[x]\subset\mathbb{Q}[x]$ to factorize elements of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ as product of polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ and then use Gauss lemma to prove that the factorization can also be done using polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ only. Thus it appears that existence of GCD is not necessary to guarantee existence of unique factorization. Does that mean we can prove unique factorization in $\mathbb{Z}$ via some other means rather than the approach I outlined in the beginning? Also I would like to know if the property of prime numbers (mentioned in theorem at the beginning) is always a consequence of the existence of GCD in a more generally setting of integral domains? Update : From the comments and in particular the wiki link given by Hand Lundmark it is clear that the ideas of the usual ring of integers have been generalized in many ways to give rise to the famous chain of class inclusions (see wiki link on GCD Domains ) and this question is perhaps a very naive attempt to understand that all (or some of) those inclusions are proper . Further Update : I was a bit hesitant about asking question related to a seemingly trivial matter (namely unique factorization in integers and polynomials with integer coefficients), but the way it has been received here is so much more than what I expected. MSE never ceases to amaze me (and perhaps other users too)! Thanks to all those who answered/commented/chatted. I have now got a lot of food for thought (and study).","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'unique-factorization-domains']"
2235062,union of proper subgroup is proper?,"Question: Prove that a finite group is the union of proper subgroups IFF the group is not cyclic. Let G be a finite group. Suppose G is the union of proper subgroups $b_{i}$ . This means that there is an element in G that is not in $b_{1}$ .

This was a question I thought of many years ago. At that time I was able to prove it by writing a computer program to count for me.

Firstly, this webpage gives two different proofs that the answer is ""no"", and that there are exactly $120$ possible permutations of the corner pieces. Secondly, I give a proof below that my brother and I found. My question is whether there are other ways to prove this that are fundamentally different, and hopefully more elegant than these proofs.

2235253,"Which (3,1)-tensors with the symmetry properties of the Riemann curvature tensor, arise as the actual curvature tensor of a metric?","This is a question that came to me while reading Kazumi Tsukada's paper ""Totally Geodesic Submanifolds and Curvature-Invariant Subspaces"". (I haven't read the whole thing.) He takes the set up of a 'curvature tensor' $R$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which I assume means a multilinear map $$  \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n, \ \ (u,v,w) \mapsto R(u,v)w,  $$ with the symmetry properties of the Riemann curvature tensor. I'll call such a thing an 'abstract curvature tensor'. Then, Tsukada aims to classify 'curvature-invariant subspaces' $W \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. This must be relevant in the problem of finding/classifying totally-geodesic submanifolds in Riemannian manifolds, since by Cartan's criterion, a TGS passes through a point with a given tangent space $W \subset T_pM$ precisely when local parallel translates of $W$ are $R$-invariant, for $R$ the Riemann curvature tensor. But it all seems a bit silly to me unless these abstract curvature tensors on $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be realised as the curvature tensor of, if not a Levi-Civita connection of a metric, then at least of some connection on a manifold. So, Question: Given an abstract curvature tensor $R$ on a vector space $V = \mathbb{R}^n$, when can we realise $R$ as the curvature tensor at a point $T_pM = V$, ideally for a Levi-Civita connection? Or, more generally, for a connection on some other vector bundle? Idea: Do a parameter count. The number of parameters for an abstract curvature tensor is $ n \choose 2 $ $= n(n-1)/2$, since the abstract sectional curvatures $\langle R(u,v)v,u \rangle$ determine $R$ by the symemtry properties. However, there are $n(n+1)/2$ parameters 'at each point' in choosing a Riemannain metric $g$. So, if the process of going from $g$ to $R$ has redundancy no more than 2, I expect that at least an open subset of all abstract curvature tensors can be realised as Riemann curvature tensors at a point. If someone could point me in the direction to an answer to this (which I suspect exists...?), or just has ideas, I'd be super grateful.","['connections', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'curvature']"
