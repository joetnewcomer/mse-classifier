2891193,Direct image of vector bundle under projection map,"Let $\pi: Y \to X$ be a smooth projection map between manifolds, and assume the fibres of the map have constant dimension: dim $\left(\pi^{-1}(x)\right)=d ~~ \forall x \in X$ . Given a smooth map between manifolds, one can define the pushforward or direct image $\pi_*V$ of a vector bundle $V$ . Formally one thinks of the vector bundle as a sheaf and then defines the direct image as for a sheaf . My question is how to actually compute the result for common, simple vector bundles. Examples are the trivial vector bundle $\mathcal{O}_Y$ , the tangent $T_Y$ or cotangent bundle $T_Y^*$ , or the canonical $K_Y$ or anti-canonical bundle $K_Y^*$ . I would be interested to know how to work these out using the formal definition of the direct image, or how to cleverly avoid this explicit computation. Even better would be to understand also the answers in the case of the higher direct images $R^p\pi_*V$ .","['vector-bundles', 'algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory', 'differential-geometry']"

2891195,Pushforward of quasi-coherent sheaves to quotient stack for finite group action?,"Let $R$ be a ring and $G$ be a finite group. 
Assume there is a $G$ action on $\operatorname{Spec} R$. For example, the group $\{\pm1\}$ acts on $\mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$ by $(-1) z = -z$. 
let $\pi : \operatorname{Spec} R \longrightarrow (\operatorname{Spec} R) /G$ be the canonical projection map to the quotient stack. We can identify $\operatorname{QCoh} (\operatorname{Spec} R)$ with $R$-module and $\operatorname{QCoh} ( (\operatorname{Spec} R) /G)$
with $G$-equivariant $R$-module. 
Under this identification, the pullback $\pi^\ast$ is just the forgetful functor from $G$-equivariant $R$-module to $R$-module. My question is what is $\pi_\ast$ in this case? Answers or reference are both welcome. The definition I know for this pushforward is from D. Gaitsgory and N. Rozenblyum's book which is not very computational.","['finite-groups', 'modules', 'algebraic-stacks', 'algebraic-geometry', 'derived-functors']"

2891338,Pushforward-change-of-variable with quantile function,"I’ve been dealing with an issue about change-of-variable formula. Let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $\mathbf R_+$. Let $F(x) = μ([0,p])$ and $Q$ its quantile function, ie $Q(p) = \inf \{q \in \mathbf R_+ : F(q) \ge p\}$. As $Q$ is increasing, it is Borel. Thus, let $\ell$ be Lebesgue measure on $\mathbf R_+$ and $Q_*(\ell)$ its pushforward by $Q$, ie $Q_*(\ell)(A) = \ell(Q^{-1}(A))$. It is well-known (Galois formula) that for all $x \in \mathbf R_+$ and $p \in [0,1]$, $Q(p) \le x \iff p \le F(x)$. Thus, if $0 \le a \le b$, then
$$Q_*(\ell)((a,b]) = \ell(Q^{-1}( (a,b])) = \ell((F(a), F(b)]) = F(a) - F(a) = \mu((a,b])$$ The familiy of intervals of form $(a,b]$ is a $\pi$-system on the set $\mathbf R_+$ which generates the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathscr B(\mathbf R_+)$. It follows that $Q_*(\ell)$ and $\mu$ are the same measure. One can define the Lorenz function : $λ(p) = \int_0^p Q(t) \ell(\mathrm d t)$. Now, I apply the change-of-variable formula, and I get :
$$ \lambda(p) = \int_{Q(0)}^{Q(p)} u~ Q_*(\ell)(\mathrm d u) = \int_0^{Q(p)}u \mu(\mathrm d u) $$ But this equality is false if (and only if ?) $\mu$ has atoms. The simplest possible example is $\mu = \delta_1$, the Dirac mass in $1$ : $Q$ is a function that maps $0$ to $0$ and any value $p \in (0,1]$ to $1$, so $\lambda$ is the identity function on $[0,1]$. But $\int_0^{Q(p)}u \mu(\mathrm d u)$ is the same function than $Q$. Then, two questions : What is wrong in the previous calculus? Is the equality $\lambda(p) = \int_0^{Q(p)} u \mu(\mathrm d u)$ true if one assumes $μ$ is diffuse (ie has no atom)?

2891384,Counting equivalence classe - proof theorem,"THEOREM: ( Counting equivalence classes ) Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a finite set $A$. If all the equivalence relation of a finite set $A$ have the same size, $m$, then the number of equivalence classes is $|A|/m$. First comment, I think that the number of equivalence class is always $|A|$, because $\forall a \in A : a \in [a]$. In general we suppose different equivalence classes on $A$ like the theorem. Is that correct ? proof Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a finite set A and all the equivalence classes of $R$ have the same size $m$.
So, each equivalence class contains $m$ elements, $[a_1] = \{a_1, a_2, \dots,a_m\}$ and we know (every element is related to itself) $a_1 \in [a_1], a_2 \in [a_2], \dots, a_m \in [a_m]$. Because if $[a_i] \cap [a_j] \neq \emptyset, 1 \leq i < j \leq m$, then $[a_i] = [a_j]$. We have $m$ same equivalence classes. Now, I am not sure how continue... It can be question like this. We have 100 beads, and 10 different colours. Each colours have 10 beads (e. g. blue has 10 beads, green has 10 bead, and so
  on). How many different (by colour) beads we have? Of course answer is
  100/10 = 10. How many different equivalence classes we have? - immediately, the answer is $|A|/m$. Can you please check my proof? If it's ok, then please help me reformulate the end of the proof. Else say where is the problem. Thank you.",['discrete-mathematics']
2891456,Are there well-ordered towers of cardinality that of the continuum?,"Let $Y \supseteq^{*} X$ denote that all but finitely many members of X belong to Y. Recall that a tower is a linearly quasi-ordered subset of $(\mathcal{P}^{\omega}(\omega), \supseteq^{*})$ maximal with respect to upward extension (equivalently, with no infinite ""almost intersections""; note that the notation $\supseteq^{*}$ corresponds here to reverse inclusion), and that the cardinal $\mathfrak{t}$ is the least cardinality of any tower. Van Douwen defines $\mathfrak{t}$ equivalently as the least cardinality of any well-ordered tower. It is not too hard to show that $\omega < \mathfrak{t} \leq \mathfrak{c}$ and  that there exists a tower of cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$. However, it is less obvious to me that there exists a well-ordered tower of cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$. In other words, does the poset of subsets of $\omega$ up to almost-equality, ordered with respect to almost-inclusion, admit a subset of order-type $\mathfrak{c}$? My motivation for this question is that each of the cardinal characteristics of the continuum are usually defined as the minimum of sets of cardinals with trivial maximum, but it is not obvious to me whether the trivial maximum is attained in this otherwise natural alternative definition of $\mathfrak{t}$.","['general-topology', 'set-theory']"

First let's open the expression so we can take the derivative $$f(x -\lambda d) = a(x -\lambda d)^t(Qx -Q\lambda d) + b^tx -b^t\lambda d + c = \\ ax^tQx-a\lambda xQd-a\lambda d^tQx+a\lambda^2d^tQd + b^tx -b^t\lambda d + c $$ so $$f' = -axQd-ad^tQx + 2a\lambda d^tQd-b^td = 0\implies\\ 2a\lambda d^tQd = b^td+axQd + aQx$$ but this expression doesn't even have the gradient, neither the hessian.

Then, we draw the circle with center in $E$ and passing by $A,C$. If we take the perpendicular to $AC$ passing by $E$, we define a point $I$, where the circle intersects the perpendicular line. Now, we can draw the ellipse with focii in $A$ and $C$ and passing by $I$. Clearly, we can apply this procedure to both the other sides, obtaining other two ellipses.

  Then $(a_n)$ is convergent. My idea to prove that the proposition above is true is as follows: since $(a_n)$ is bounded, it has limit points. Then, by assuming that the sequence is not convergent, there are two different limit points $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and subsequences of $(a_n)$: $(a_{k_n})$ and $(a_{j_n})$ such that $a_{k_n}\to \alpha$ and $a_{j_n}\to\beta$. Now, I tried to build a subsequence $(a_{p_n})$ of $(a_n)$ with the property $p_{2n+1}=p_{2n}+1$ such that $(a_{p_{2n+1}})$ is a subsequence of $(a_{k_n})$ and $(a_{p_{2n}})$ is a subsequence of $(a_{j_n})$ thus there will exist a subsequence of the sequence $(a_{n+1}-a_{n})$ convergent to $\alpha-\beta$, which would be a contradiction.

  a binary operator. If I understand correctly, then it means $(a,b) \in S \times S \Rightarrow f(a,b)=a\text{*}b  \in S$ then $\text{*}$ is a binary operator. Alright fine. But that doesn't explain that why is $f$ a binary operator? Let me explain my doubt more clearly, I'm having trouble with notations here, If $f(a,b) = a \text{*} b$ where $\text{*}$ is a binary operator. And if I say that $f$ is the same binary operator as well, then $f= \text{*}$.
So I can write $f(a,b)= afb$ which seems to be absurd because $b$ is not the image of $a$ under $f$. The correct expression (according to me) should be $(a,b)f(a\text{*}b)$ So, $f$ can't be $\text{*}$. I don't understand how can a relation (function in this case) be equal to a binary operator EDIT: What I'm trying to say is, If $R$ is a relation, then if $b$ is the image of $a$ under $R$, then we write it as, $aRb$ By the definition in my textbook, $ * : S \times S \to S $ where $*$ is a binary operator $\Rightarrow$ function $\Rightarrow$ Relation.

Then $$X_{n} / s_n \rightarrow N(0,1) \Longleftrightarrow s_n \rightarrow \infty.$$ The reverse implication follows from the observation that the Lindeberg condition is satisfied (because each individual $X_{i,n}$ is bounded). But what about the forward implication? I would like to argue as follows: If $s_n \rightarrow S < \infty$ then the limit distribution $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} X_n/s_n$ exists and is not equal to $N(0,1)$ because well, I don't know , maybe an explicit computation or because of Cramer's decomposition theorem ???

As I am not a mathematician, I presume that my questions are rather basic in nature. I would very much appreciate, though, if someone (who might have a little time on their hands) could help me to see what I am missing. Provided that $\mu_n$ weakly converges to $\mu$, I learned that the following statements are equivalent

I do, however, struggle to see how b) implies c). Building on a couple of proofs I have seen so far, it would seem that it is key to construct a set $A_k$ such that $$A_k=\{x\in S:\text{inf}\{|x-y|:y\in A\}\leq k^{-1}\,\}.$$
Hence, as $k\to\infty$ it follows that $A_k\downarrow A$. Moreover, most proofs go on proposing to define a bounded, Lipschitz function $f_k:S\to\mathbb{R}$ such that 
$$\mathbb{1}_A\leq f_k\leq\mathbb{1}_{A_k}$$
Unfortunately, I have not been able to find a single proof that features an explicit function, so I am a little bit lost at this point. Question 1: How would such a function look like and how would one go about proving that this function is, in fact, Lipschitz continuous? Provided this function exists, it follows that
$$\underset{n\to\infty}{\lim\text{sup}} \int_S\mathbb{1}_A\text{d}\mu_n\leq\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_Sf_k\text{d}\mu_n=\int_Sf_k\text{d}\mu\leq\int_S\mathbb{1}_{A_k}\text{d}\mu$$ 
I understand that the last inequality follows from the increasing property of the Lebesgue integral and the penultimate equality follows from b). I struggle, however, with this part
$$\underset{n\to\infty}{\lim\text{sup}} \int_S\mathbb{1}_A\text{d}\mu_n\leq\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_Sf_k\text{d}\mu_n$$
As I am not a mathematician by education, I have looked up the definition of the limit superior on Wikipedia and I have learned that  $$\underset{n\to\infty}{\lim\text{sup}} \int_S\mathbb{1}_A\text{d}\mu_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sup\left(\int_S\mathbb{1}_A\text{d}\mu_m:m\geq n\right)$$
but I have no idea how that translates to the above inequality. Question 2: I would be very grateful, if someone could give me some sort of step-by-step explanation of how this first inequality comes about. Moving on; I do see how $k\to\infty$ then yields the desired result. But... Question 3: Statement d) is supposed to follow from c) ""by taking complements"". Since I do not even really see how the fact that all sets $A$ are closed factors into the line of reasoning above, I have no idea how the fact that all sets $B$ are open makes d) equivalent to c) by taking complements.

  What is this number? Now, I have an easy solution for this problem. The point is that I have read a different solution which seems cleaner and interesting but which I don't fully understand. Here the solution which I do not understand: Let $x_k$ be the last remaining number after proceeding as described
  with the numbers between $1$ and $2^k$. If you proceed with numbers
  between $1$ and $2^{k+1}$, after the first iteration remain only the
  $2^k$ even numbers, and the following $k$ iterations select the even
  number in position $x_k$ counting from the bottom ($x_k^{th}$ even number from the bottom). 
  So we have 
  $$
x_{k+1}=2(2^k-x_k+1)=2^{k+1}-2x_k+2
$$
  Knowing that $x_0=1$, we can easily obtain $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_7$.
  So $x_7=86$ is the solution. Now my problem is how to motivate the step from $2^k$ to $2^{k+1}$. Any clue?","['elementary-number-theory', 'algebra-precalculus', 'problem-solving', 'recreational-mathematics']"

Axiomatically $s$ is injective and not surjective. Now, $\Bbb{N}$ is infinite, just because it is being ""generated"" by function $s$. Consider following theorem: Theorem: Let $A$ be a set. Let there be a function $f:A\rightarrow A$ which is injective but not surjective. Then $A$ is infinite. We don't want to talk about natural numbers themselves, so we don't use the definition that set $X$ is infinite if there is no bijection $\psi:X\rightarrow\{1,2,...,n\}$. We define infinite set as follows. Definition: A set $X$ is infinite iff there is a bijection $\varphi:X'\rightarrow X$ where $X'\subsetneq X$ is a proper subset of $X$. I was wondering if someone could help me (dis)prove this hypothesis. My idea goes like this: Because $f$ is not surjective, that means $f(A)\subsetneq A$, which shows $f$ is the desired bijection between proper subset of $A$ and $A$ itself.

The $N\ge 2$ makes me think that somehow this problem on the line collapses because of dimension $1$, and for higher dimensions it's like I'm in a plane and can walk in many directions. I don't see how to connect this with the fact that $$\sum\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i^2} = 0$$ For the one dimensional case, $$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = 0$$ for all $x$ in some $\Omega$, so it's an interval. This is the same as saying that the function has second derivative $0$ at an open the interval. If it were just a point I'd say the function might have an inflection point, but in fact it's in an entire open interval. Let's first think of the most basic example: $u(x) = 1$. The set $u^{-1}(u(x))$ is the entire interval on which the function is harmonic (even more, but let's focus on that). So in this case it is infinite.

Generalising $(3)$ to any odd value  $n\in \mathbb{N}$, gives the following formula:

Now, by the Archimedean property, there is $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n} < \delta $. Pick $x_1 = \frac{4}{4n+1}$ and $x_2 = \frac{4}{4n+3}$ and note that $x_1 , x_2 <  \delta $.

The wikipedia page on division algebras mentions that any finite-dimensional division algebra over the reals must be of dimension 1, 2, 4, or 8. 
 It also mentions the only finite-dimensional division algebras over the real numbers which are alternative algebras are the real numbers themselves, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions. (And this claims we don't even need the finite-dimensional qualifier for the last statement.) Hurwitz's theorem tells us that these are also the only normed unital division algebras over the reals. So any finite dimensional division algebra over the reals other than $\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C},\mathbb{H},$ or $\mathbb{O}$ cannot have a norm if it is unital, nor have a matrix representation, nor even be alternative.

2892843,Solving the wave equation under a Neumann boundary condition on the gradient at one point,"This is my first question/contribution even though I have been following hot topics for a while, I have been confronted a to a problem recently and I don't really know how to address it. This comes from acoustics, there is a consequent amount of literature around solving the wave equation under homogeneous Neumann condition on some boundaries. This represent the case of a sound wave propagating in a room with perfectly reflecting walls. One method for addressing this problem is the image source method where we construct a lattice from the source by reflecting though a list of walls.
This was done for an arbitrary polyhedral room in 1984 in a paper named ""Extension of the image model to arbitrary polyhedra"" by Jeffrey Borish. Unfortunately he don't give proofs of his argument, just some intuition. I am currently researching on this and I would like to be able to prove his results, but I would like to also generalize the method for non closed rooms So long story short, I end up been stuck solving the following equation for the pressure
$$\nabla^2 p({\bf x}) + k^2 p({\bf x}) = 0$$
Subject to
$$\nabla p({\bf y}) = {\bf q}$$
Where we know $k$, ${\bf q}$ and ${\bf y}$ (${\bf x}$ and ${\bf y}$ are vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$)
Of course as is, there might even not be a solution to this problem, I have been reading through section 6 of the book ""Methods of Theoretical physics"" which gave me some useful insight, in the end of section 6.2 he states the cases when the solution exists and about uniqueness. For my case, Hyperbolic equation with open boundaries, they state that we have insufficient information about the problem. So I may actually have a solution. In the sane book section 6.3, he solve a lot of these kinds of equations but the boundaries condition always seems to be homogeneous. They are using an eigen decomposition of the problem, maybe it is possible to adapt this reasoning to my problem.
Finally I went through a substantial amount of literature on the subject but the boundaries conditions where almost always homogeneous. I also could not find a similar question here or somewhere else on the web. So if any one have an idea about this I would be glad to discuss it.
I hope that this is clear enough.
Thanks in advance. EDIT : I forgot to mention that in I also have boundaries conditions at infinite distance from the origin, the pressure is supposed to be zero. EDIT 2 : I think the solution may actually be unique. The uniqueness should not depend on the choice of ${\bf q}$ or ${\bf y}$ and so we can probably just look at ${\bf y} = {\bf q} = {\bf 0}$. In this case if we use a eigen decomposition argument, we get that our eigen functions would be of the form $\cosh(a_{k,i} x_i)$ for $x_i$ the i'th coordinate of ${\bf x}$ and for any $a_{k,i}$, then we can express our pressure as 
$$p({\bf x}) = \sum_k \sum_i A_{k,i} \cosh(a_{k,i} x_i)$$
and
$$\nabla^2 p({\bf x}) = \sum_k \sum_i A_{k,i} a_{k,i}^2 \cosh(a_{k,i} x_i)$$
Now the next step is a bit unclear but I think that in order to have $\nabla^2 p({\bf x}) + k^2 p({\bf x}) = 0$, then we need to have $A_{k,i} a_{k,i}^2 + A_{k,i} k^2 =0$ for all $k$ and $i$. This can only be true if for all $k$ and $i$, $A_{k,i}=0$.
Does this reasoning makes sense ? And is way to generalize to any ${\bf q}$ ? Then generalizing to any ${\bf y}$ is trivial.","['wave-equation', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

2892976,Operator characterizations of continuity and “co-continuity”,"$\let \op \operatorname$There are several characterizations of continuity of a map $f: X \to Y$ between topological spaces of the form $f^•[\op{op} A] \diamond \op{op} f^•[A]$ for every $A ⊆ X$ or $Y$ where $f^• ∈ \{f, f^{-1}, f^∀\}$ denotes image, preimage, and dual image ($f^∀[A] := Y \setminus f[X \setminus A]$), $\op{op} ∈ \{\op{cl}, \op{int}\}$ denotes the closure or interior operator, and $\diamond ∈ \{⊆, ⊇\}$ denotes the inclusion in either direction. This gives $3 × 2 × 2 = 12$ combinations. By using some symmetries and dualities, it is easy to show that some conditions are equivalent. Namely, the following conditions correspond to continuity, i.e. $f^{-1}[U]$ is open for every open $U ⊆ Y$, or equivalently $f^{-1}[F]$ is closed for every closed $F ⊆ Y$: $f[\op{cl}(A)] ⊆ \op{cl}(f[A])$, $f^∀[\op{int}(A)] ⊇ \op{int}(f^∀[A])$, $f^{-1}[\op{cl}(B)] ⊇ \op{cl}(f^{-1}[B])$, $f^{-1}[\op{int}(B)] ⊆ \op{int}(f^{-1}[B])$. The following conditions correspond to closedness, i.e. $f[F]$ is closed for every closed $F ⊆ X$, or equivalently $f^∀[U]$ is open for every open $U ⊆ X$: $f[\op{cl}(A)] ⊇ \op{cl}(f[A])$, $f^∀[\op{int}(A)] ⊆ \op{int}(f^∀[A])$. The following conditions correspond to openness, i.e. $f[U]$ is open for every open $U ⊆ X$, or equivalently $f^∀[F]$ is closed for every closed $F ⊆ X$: $f[\op{int}(A)] ⊆ \op{int}(f[A])$, $f^∀[\op{cl}(A)] ⊇ \op{cl}(f^∀[A])$, $f^{-1}[\op{int}(B)] ⊇ \op{int}(f^{-1}[B])$, $f^{-1}[\op{cl}(B)] ⊆ \op{cl}(f^{-1}[B])$. The remaining two conditions are also equivalent and correspond to what I call “co-continuity” here: $f[\op{int}(A)] ⊇ \op{int}(f[A])$, $f^∀[\op{cl}(A)] ⊆ \op{cl}(f^∀[A])$. The question: Is this co-continuity condition present somewhere in the literature? Does it have some nice properties? Or is there a reason why it is not interesting? For now, I have made the following observations: Co-continuous maps are stable under compositions, and similarly to continuity, it is easier to achieve if the domain topology is finer and if the co-domain topology is coarser. The map $f: X \to Y$ is co-continuous if for every open (in $Y$) $U ⊆ f[X]$ and every $f$-section $s: U \to X$ (i.e. $f ∘ s = \op{id}_U$) the set $s[U]$ is also open. In particular, if $f$ is co-continous, then $f^{-1}(y)$ is open discrete for every isolated point $y ∈ Y$. If $f$ is co-continuous then $f^{-1}[U]$ is open for every open (in $Y$) $U ⊆ f[X]$, so for surjective maps, co-continuity implies continuity. On the other hand, for injective maps, continuity implies co-continuity. $f$ is co-continuous with respect to the topology $τ$ on $Y$ if and only if it is co-continuous with respect to $τ' := \{U ∈ τ: U ⊆ f[X]\} ∪ \{Y\}$. And $τ'$-co-continuity implies $τ'$-continuity. (Similarly, $τ$-continuity is equivalent to $τ''$-continuity where $τ''$ makes $f[X]$ open and every $y ∈ Y \setminus f[X]$ isolated. Also, $τ''$-co-continuity implies $τ''$-continuity.) In general, if $f[X]$ is open, then co-continuity implies continuity. On the other hand, if $f[X]$ has empty interior, then co-continuity is trivial. If $f$ is co-continuous, then $f[C]$ is co-dense for every co-dense $C ⊆ X$, or equivalently $f^∀[D]$ is dense for every dense $D ⊆ X$.","['continuity', 'general-topology']"

2893106,"What is the ""right"" extra information needed to define the trace of a map between two different vector spaces?","Let $V,W$ be real vector spaces of dimension $d$, and let $T \in \text{Hom}(V,W)$. Is there a ""natural piece of additional information"" required in order to give a meaningful interpretation of the trace of $T$? (which is ""less than"" choosing an isomorphism $V \cong W$). Let me explain a bit what do I mean by ""additional information"" through other examples: Suppose we want to define the determinant of $T$. Then sufficient additional information is a choice of preferred volume forms on $V,W$. Assuming we are given such forms, we can then define $\det T$ by requiring 
$$T^*(\text{Vol}_W)=\det T \cdot \text{Vol}_V.$$ Perhaps an even more economical option would be to provide an isomorphism $\bigwedge^d V \simeq \bigwedge^d W$. Since $\bigwedge^d T:\bigwedge^d V \to \bigwedge^d W
$, by composing it with the given isomorphism we can identify $\bigwedge^d T$ with a map $\bigwedge^d V \to \bigwedge^d V$ which can then be naturally identified with a  scalar. (Choosing a volume form is equivalent to choosing an isomorphism $\bigwedge^d V \cong \mathbb{R}$). Of course, we could be given an isomorphism $V \simeq W$ and consider $T$ as a map $V \to V$, but my point is that this is much more than we really need. In the same spirit, in order to define the singular values of a map, we need to choose inner products on both spaces. (Which is again less information then choosing isomorphisms of $V,W$ to $\mathbb{R}^d$). The question is whether there is an ""analogous"" piece of extra structure which naturally fits into the definition of the trace. Of course, when $V=W$ (or when we are given some isomorphism between $V$ and $W$) we can define the trace of $T$ as a map $V \to V$. (A coordinate-free version would be using the natural identification $V^* \otimes V \cong \text{Hom}(V,V)$, and the contraction map $V^* \otimes V  \to F$. Alternatively we can choose a basis, and use the fact the trace of a matrix is invariant under conjugation). I am aware that it's not entirely clear whether the trace can be given a purely ""geometric meaning"" (in the sense that it's not invariant under isometries for instance). This is different than the situation with the determinant, or the singular values. Edit: In a slight contrast to the last contrast, here is some evidence that the trace is at least ""partially"" a geometric creature: The space of trace-free matrices is the tangent space at the identity to $SL_d$ (the group of volume preserving matrices). Thus, I am guessing that we shall need at least something like an isomorphism $\bigwedge^d V \simeq \bigwedge^d W$ (in order to define a notion of volume preservation for maps). Using this isomorphism, we can now identify $\bigwedge^d T$ as a map $\bigwedge^d V \to \bigwedge^d V$, and define 
$$
""SL""=\{ T \in \text{Hom}(V,W) \, | \, \bigwedge^d T=\text{Id}_{\bigwedge^d V} \}.
$$ The problem is that I am not sure if we can ""single out"" which element is the analog of the ""identity map"" among all these elements of our $""SL""$. Thus, I am not sure that a choice of an isomorphism $\bigwedge^d V \simeq \bigwedge^d W$ would suffice to even define what is ""trace=$0$""...","['trace', 'category-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'soft-question']"

(Perhaps someone could tell me how to solve such integrals by differentiation under the integral sign?) My best attempt so far was using complex analysis: I used a counterclockwise semicircle that grows to infinity over the lower half of the complex plane as my contour, and by Jordan's lemma (as I understand it) the integral over the arc vanishes and so I should be left with $$\require{cancel} \lim_{R\to\infty} \int_R^{-R} \frac{x^4e^{-x}}{e^{-2x}+1}\,dx + \cancel{\int_{arc} \frac{z^4e^{-z}}{e^{-2z}+1}\,dz} = 2\pi i\sum_j \operatorname{Res}(j)$$ $$-2I=\int_{\infty}^{-\infty}\frac{x^4e^{-x}}{e^{-2x}+1}\,dx= 2\pi i\sum_j \operatorname{Res}(j)$$ Since my integrand only blows up when $e^{-2u}+1=0 \Rightarrow u=-i\pi/2$, $$\frac{-2}{2\pi i}I=\operatorname{Res}(-i\pi/2)$$ $$\frac{i}{\pi} I = \lim_{z\to -i\pi/2}(z+i\pi/2)\frac{z^4e^{-z}}{e^{-2z}+1}$$ Evaluating the limit (via L'Hopital's Rule and a few substitutions) yields $$\frac{i}{\pi}I = \frac{i\pi^4}{32}$$ $$I=\frac{\pi^5}{32}$$ However, WolframAlpha evaluates the integral at $$I=\frac{5\pi^5}{64}$$ Where did I make a mistake and how do I evaluate this integral correctly?

2893136,Deformation theory formalism,"I just started reading Hartshorne's ""Deformation theory"" book and occasionally I get confused by the way he treats various objects (and it seems like it is common in the literature overall, e.g. in the literature on the moduli spaces of sheaves). A typical example would be as follows ( theorem 2.7 in the book): Given a scheme $X$ over $k$ with a coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ we call a (first-order) deformation of $\mathcal{F}$ over $D=Spec \ k[t]/t^2$ the data of a coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}'$ over $X'=X\times D$, flat over D, together with a homomorphism $\mathcal{F}' \to \mathcal{F}$ which induces an isomorphism $\mathcal{F}' \otimes k \to \mathcal{F}$. Then the statement is that such deformations are in one-to-one correspondence with $\text{Ext}_{X}^{1} (\mathcal{F},\mathcal{F}).$ The very first line of the proof says the following: flatness of $\mathcal{F}'$ over $D$ is equivalent to the exactness of $$0\to \mathcal{F} \xrightarrow{t} \mathcal{F}' \to \mathcal{F} \to 0 $$obtained by tensoring $\mathcal{F}'$ with $0 \to k \xrightarrow{t} k[t]/t^2 \to k \to 0$. Now the question is:
what does it mean to tensor a sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{X'}$-modules with a $k[t]/t^2$ module (not even a sheaf)? There are various ways I tried to make sense of it in a more sheaf-theoretic way, namely: Change the ringed space structure on $X'$ by replacing $\mathcal{O}_{X'}$ with constant sheaf of rings $k[t]/t^2$, interpret $\mathcal{F}'$ as a sheaf of $k[t]/t^2$ modules and treat $k[t]/t^2,k$ as constant sheaves of $k[t]/t^2$ modules on $X'$. Then interpret $\mathcal{F}' \otimes k[t]/t^2, \mathcal{F}' \otimes k$ in the usual way as a tensor product of sheaves of $k[t]/t^2$ modules. Then probably run this machine back and check that the resulting sheaves are actually sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_{X'}$ modules. Seems like a very round-about way of doing things, and seems like it is becoming more and more clumsy if we are taking higher order deformations, or even an arbitrary Artin ring to deform over. More naively, interpret say $(\mathcal{F}' \otimes k) \ (U) = \mathcal{F}' (U) \otimes k$, check that it is a sheaf and check that it has whatever structure you are interested in (sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{X'}, \mathcal{O}_{X}, k[t]/t^2$-modules, etc.) Seems like a nice shortcut way, but it also seems like certain functoriality properties are not so clear anymore, so that the existence of certain maps, behavior under exact sequences, etc. should now be separately checked locally on an open set. After all I think that the above two interpretations and actually all other conceivable interpretations give the same answer. But is anyone aware of a concise and precise way of interpreting operations like tensoring a sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ modules with a field, a vector space, an $R$-module, etc? A pointer to a resource where this is explicated in detail would be much welcomed.","['algebraic-geometry', 'deformation-theory', 'sheaf-theory']"
2893148,What is a relation between energy space and $L^p_s-$Sobolev spaces?,"We define energy space 
$$E= \left\{ f\in \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb R^d):\|\nabla f\|_{L^2} + \|xf\|_{L^2} < \infty \right\}.$$ and

where $\langle \cdot \rangle = (1+ |\cdot|^2)^{1/2}, s\in \mathbb R,$ and $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ are Fourier transform and the inverse Fourier transform. My Question is: Is there any relation between $E$ and $L^p_s (p\neq 2)$? Specifically, I'm interested to know the relation between $E$ and $L^p_s$ for $s>d(\frac{2}{p}-1), 1\leq p <2$? Side Thoughts : I think there is no any relations between $L^p-$spaces on $\mathbb R^d,$ I'm guessing there might no relations between $E$ and $L^{p}_s (p\neq 2).$ But I do not know how to construct counter examples? Motivation: This spaces appear in PDE very often. Rough Ideas in constructing counter example :
Define $$f_p(x)= \sum_{k\neq 0} |k|^{-\frac{d}{p}-\epsilon} e^{ik\cdot x} e^{-|x|^2}$$ in $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb R^d) \ (1< p<2).$ Can we say that $f_p\in E$? For simplicity  we consider one dimension case, that is, $d=1.$
We note that $$\nabla f(x) =f'(x)= \sum_{k\neq 0} |k|^{-\frac{d}{p}-\epsilon} e^{ik\cdot x} e^{-|x|^2}=\sum_{k\neq 0} |k|^{-\frac{d}{p}-\epsilon} (-2|x|e^{ik\cdot x} e^{-|x|^2} + ik e^{ik\cdot x} e^{-|x|^2} ) $$ Now $\|\nabla f\|_{L^2}^2 =  \int_{\mathbb R} \left|\sum_{k\in \mathbb Z \setminus \{0\} } |k|^{-\frac{d}{p}-\epsilon} (-2|x|e^{ik\cdot x} e^{-|x|^2} + ik e^{ik\cdot x} e^{-|x|^2} ) \right|^2 dx$ I do not know how to proceed but my guess is there might exists $1<p<2$ such that $f_p \notin E.$","['examples-counterexamples', 'fourier-analysis', 'analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
