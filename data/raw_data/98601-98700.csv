1363285,Why should I use derivatives and calculus?,"I know that this question maybe sounds pretty generic, but it's a curiosity that I have and I didn't found any answer yet. I recently started studying calculus using this material where is said that ""The fundamental idea of calculus is to study change by studying ""instantaneous"" change"". So, its said that when you're trying to find a instantaneous speed you should use the derivative of delta Distance by delta Time and not the ""common"" equation (without the derivate). My questions are: (1) why derivaties represents the instantaneous change in the system, (2) why the equation not-derived don't represent correctly that instantaneous change (considering that that still receives the instantaneous parameters for time and space) and (3) why should I use calculus? Thanks.","['calculus', 'derivatives']"

1363322,An open and connected subset $U\subseteq \mathbb C$ is still connected if you remove a curve that lies entirely in $U$,"Let $U\subseteq \mathbb C$ be open and connected. If $f\colon [0,1]\to U$ is continuous with $f(0)\neq f(1)$ and $f(s)\neq f(t)$ for $s\neq t$, then $U\setminus f([0,1])$ is connected. This seems to be ""obviously true"", so I'm looking for a proof. What I have so far: As $U$ is open, it is path-connected. I want to show, that $V:=U\setminus f([0,1])$ is path-connected as well. Let $a,b\in U$, then we have $\varphi\colon[0,1]\to U$ continuous with $\varphi(0)=a$ and $\varphi(1)=b$. If $\varphi([0,1])\subset V$ we're done. Now assume that $\varphi([0,1])\notin V$. For sufficient small $\varepsilon>0$ we have $0=t_0<\dots <t_n=1$ with $$f([t_{j-1},t_j])\in K_{\varepsilon}(f(t_j)\subset U,~j=1,\dots n$$ where $K_{\varepsilon}(f(t_j))$ denotes the open disk with radius $\varepsilon$ and origin $f(t_j)$. I want to cover the curve $f$ with small, overlapping circles, so when $\varphi$ gets near $f$, it first has to cross over $\partial K_{\varepsilon}(f(t_i))$ and I can use the $\partial K_{\varepsilon}(f(t_i))$ to get ""around $f$"". I have proven, that such circles as above exist, but do they always overlap? Edit: for my application it is enough to further assume that $f$ is differentiable. This might help/I might have an idea that I'll think through.","['algebraic-topology', 'connectedness', 'general-topology']"
1363336,Unique solution of Volterra integral equation of second kind,"Dear Maths Stackexchange, In the context of a physics problem, I am looking at a linear integral equation, more specifically a 2nd kind Volterra equation in the unknown $g(t)$:
\begin{equation}
\phantom{texttexttexttex}g(t) = f(t) + \int_0^t K(t,s) g(s) \mathrm{d}s \phantom{texttexttexttex}(1)
\end{equation}
The independent variable $t\geq0$ always. Now, the problem I have is that in my case $K(t,s)$ has the form $K(t,s)=K(t)K(s)$ where $K(t)$ is a (complicated) known function that has a pole of order 2 at $t=0$ (i.e. $t^2K(t)\to K_o<\infty$ as $t\to0$) but is smooth everywhere else. By contrast, the function $K(s)=s$ and $f(t)$ is smooth everywhere on $[0,\infty]$ and satisfies $\lim\limits_{t\to 0} f(t) = 0$.
Because of this, $K(t,s)$ is not in $L^2([0,\epsilon]\times[0,\epsilon])$. Now, an easy way of solving an integral equation of type (1) is by converting it into an initial value problem. If I differentiate (1) w.r.t. after dividing by $K(t)$, then I find the first order linear ODE,
\begin{equation}
\phantom{texttext}g'(t) + \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \log(\tilde{K}(t)) - tK(t)\right)g(t) = \tilde{f}'(t)K(t)\phantom{tetextxt}(2)
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{K}=\frac{1}{K(t)}$ and $\tilde{f}(t)=\frac{f(t)}{K(t)}$.
This equation I can solve exactly, but I need an initial condition to do so.
And here lies my problem. My first try would have been to require $g(0)=0$ as an intial condition. However, upon inspection of the coefficients at $t=0$, we see that they are singular there. Therefore, imposing any initial condition at $t=0$ fails. Now this leads me to the question: Does (1) have a unique solution despite the pole in $K(t)$ and which initial condition for $g(t)$ does this unique solution correspond to in (2)?
Since the differential equation (2) follows from the integral equation (1), any equation of (1) must satisfy (2), but if there was a unique solution of (1), then obviously only one single out of the many solutions of (2) would correspond to that unique solution of (1). Can you  help me sort out my confusion? I would like to use the ODE formulation of the problem because it allows an easy analytical solution.

While $df$ is just obtained by gluing together all these local differentials. Now I'm asked to compute the differential of the i-th-coordinate map $x_i:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$. Here is my (unsuccesful) reasonement.
I have to start by calculating, for every $p$, $(dx_i)_p$.
By definition $(dx_i)_p\in (T_p\mathbb{R^n})^*$ and the latter set is spanned by $\{(dx_i)_p:1\le i\le n\}$. Now, I am a bit confused. My professor defined the basis of $(T_p\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ as the dual basis of the tangent plane and the symbols $(dx_i)_p$ are just formal symbols, nothing to do with the differential. (Right?)
I would proceed by applying the differential of $x_i$ at $p$ to a general element of the tangent space $v=\sum_j v_j(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j})_p$

(dx_i)_p(v):=v_i

1363385,Confused about one to one functions and cardinality,"There is something that I'm not getting about functions and cardinality of sets. I've read the following: If $F$ is a one to one function, then $F^{-1}$ (the inverse) is also a one-to-one function. Because when I read about cardinality of sets, I encounter with the definition: $|A|\leq |\mathcal P(A)|$ if there is a one to one function from $A$ to $\mathcal P(A)$. This function is trivial $F(a) = \{a\}$ and it's one to one and not onto. But if I follow the statement from above of $F^{-1}$ (the inverse of $F$) being also one to one, this leads me to the following : $|\mathcal P(A)|\leq |A|$ Which I know is false.

1363429,Dominated convergence theorem for complex-valued functions?,"Suppose there is a sequence $\{f_n(x)\}$ such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n(x)=f(x)$. I've previously used the dominated convergence theorem for interchanging the limit and the integral in $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_n(x)dx$ when $f_n(x)$ was a real-valued function $f_n:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$.  Per the usual steps, I would find an integrable function $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that $|f_n(x)|<g(x)$ for all $n$ in the index set and $x\in\mathbb{R}$.  I would thus justify $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_n(x)dx=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n(x)dx=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)dx$. I am wondering what happens when $f_n(x)$ as well as the limiting function $f(x)$ are complex-valued, i.e., $f_n:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$, but their integral is real-valued. How do I safely interchange the limit and the integral? Specific example The semi-classical theory of optical homodyne detection (see section on homodyne detection, for example, here ) involves subtracting two independent Poisson random variables.  The resulting random variable, when appropriately normalized, converges to a Gaussian random variable in distribution.  I am wondering if a stronger result holds, where the density function converges pointwise to the Gaussina density as well. Consider Poisson random variables $N_-$ and $N_+$ with respective means $a^2_-=\frac{1}{2}(a_S-a_L)^2$ and $a^2_+=\frac{1}{2}(a_S+a_L)^2$.  Here, $a_S$ is the amplitude of the signal field, and $a_L$ is the amplitude of the much-stronger local oscillator field.  $N_-$ and $N_+$ are the photon counts at the two arms of the homodyne detector.  To recover the signal at the output, we subtract the two counts (and normalize), which effectively cancels the local oscillator field. Thus, consider the random variable $A=\frac{N_+-N_-}{2a_L}$.  Its characteristic function is just the product of the characteristic functions of the Poisson random variables $\frac{N_+}{2a_L}$ and $-\frac{N_-}{2a_L}$: $$\phi_A(t)=\exp\left[a_+^2(e^{it/2a_L}-1)+a_-^2(e^{-it/2a_L}-1)\right],$$ where $i=\sqrt{-1}$. Now, taking the limit as $a_L\rightarrow\infty$ yields: $$\begin{align}\lim_{a_L\rightarrow\infty}\phi_A(t)&=\lim_{a_L\rightarrow\infty}\exp\left[a_+^2(e^{it/2a_L}-1)+a_-^2(e^{-it/2a_L}-1)\right]\\
&=\lim_{a_L\rightarrow\infty}\exp\left[a_+^2\left(\frac{it}{2a_L}-\frac{t^2}{8a_L^2}+\mathcal{O}(a_L^{-3})\right)+a_-^2\left(-\frac{it}{2a_L}-\frac{t^2}{8a_L^2}+\mathcal{O}(a_L^{-3})\right)\right]\\
&\begin{aligned}=\lim_{a_L\rightarrow\infty}\exp\left[\frac{1}{2}(a_S^2+2a_Sa_L+a_L^2)\left(\frac{it}{2a_L}-\frac{t^2}{8a_L^2}+\mathcal{O}(a_L^{-3})\right)\\\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+\frac{1}{2}(a_S^2-2a_Sa_L+a_L^2)\left(-\frac{it}{2a_L}-\frac{t^2}{8a_L^2}+\mathcal{O}(a_L^{-3})\right)\right]\end{aligned}\\
&=\lim_{a_L\rightarrow\infty}\exp\left[ita_S-\frac{t^2}{8}-\frac{t^2a_S^2}{8a_L^2}+\mathcal{O}(a_L^{-1})\right]\\
&=\exp\left[ita_S-\frac{t^2}{8}\right],
\end{align}$$
which is the characteristic function of Gaussian random variable with mean $a_S$ and variance $\frac{1}{4}$, thus proving convergence of $A$ to Gaussian in distribution. Now, applying the inverse Fourier transform to $\phi_A(t)$ yields the density function of $A$. I am wondering if it's Gaussian in the limit of large $a_L$.  It would be if: $$\begin{align}\lim_{a_L\rightarrow\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left[-it(x-a_S)-\frac{t^2}{8}-\frac{t^2a_S^2}{8a_L^2}+\mathcal{O}(a_L^{-1})\right]dt=\\

$$q'(t)=Q(t,q(t),z)>0.$$
I know that $\forall t$, $\forall q(t)$, $\lim_{z \rightarrow -\infty}Q(t,q(t),z)=0$, and $\lim_{z \rightarrow +\infty}Q(t,q(t),z)=+\infty$. I know that $Q(t,q(t),z)$ is increasing in $z$. 1) Do I understand correctly that, if $Q(t,q(t),z)$ is continuous in $z$, I can always find $z$ such that I will hit exactly $q(1)=q_1$? Is it obvious, or some sort of a proof is in order? 2) My $Q(t,q(t),z)$ is not continuous in $z$, but the jumps, if they happen, only happen upwards, and they are not ""frequent"" in the sense that if there is a jump for a given $z$ at a given $t$ and $q(t)$, there is no jump for all $z$ in a small neighborhood of my $z$ for the same $t$ and $q(t)$. Can I still argue that I can always hit $q(1)=q_1$? I mean, my $Q(t,q(t),z)$ is still continuous where there are no jumps... 2.1) Would it help if I could impose that, generically, if $Q(t,q(t),z)$ has a jump at $z$ for a given $t$ and $q(t)$, $Q(t,q(t)+\varepsilon,z)$ is locally continuous at the same $z$? 3) My $Q()$ turns out to be continuously differentiable, except for the points where it jumps. That probably implies Lipschitz continuity almost everywhere, which guarantees the existence of the solution to the initial value problem if I start from $q(0)=q_0$? upd I can probably only care about $q\in[q_0+\infty)$, in which case my $Q()$ is bounded, and therefore continuous differentiability in $q$, which I have, is sufficient for being Lipschitz? 4) This guy ( http://www.math.washington.edu/~burke/crs/555/555_notes/continuity.pdf , p23) says that for continuity in $z$, my $Q$ should have a Lipschitz constant independent of $z$.

Since $P^X(\cdot\mid\cdot)$ is a regular conditional probability, we know that for fixed $A \in \mathcal{F}$, the mapping $x \mapsto P^X(A\mid x)$ is $(\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}),\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$-measurable.  Hence the composition $P^X(A\mid \cdot) \circ X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is a random variable for fixed $A \in \mathcal{F}$, which the author writes as $P^X(A\mid \cdot) \circ X = P^X(A|X)$.

Suppose that $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is continuously differentiable in an open set containing $a$ , and let $\det f'(a) \not= 0$ . Then there is an open set $V$ containing $a$ and an open set $W$ containing $f(a)$ such that $f: V\to W$ has a continuous inverse $f^{-1}:W \to V$ which is differentiable and for all $y\in W$ satisfies $$ (f^{-1})'(y) = [f'(f^{-1}(y))]^{-1}.$$ The proof starts off with the following. Proof . Let $\lambda$ be the linear transformation $Df(a)$ . Then $\lambda$ is non-singular, since $\det f'(a) \not= 0$ . Now $D(\lambda^{-1}\circ f)(a) = D(\lambda^{-1})(f(a))\circ Df(a) = \lambda^{-1}\circ Df(a)$ is the identity linear transformation. If the theorem is true for $\lambda^{-1}\circ f$ , it is clearly true for $f$ . Therefore we may assume at the outset that $\lambda$ is the identity.

Give an example of a family of probability measures $P_{n}$ on $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$ such that $P_{n}\Rightarrow P$ (weakly), $P_{n}$, $P$ are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, yet there exists a Borel set $A$ such that $P_{n}(A)$ does not converge to $P(A)$. My Efforts Denote the corresponding cumulative distribution functions by
$F_{n}$, $F$. Because $P_{n}\Rightarrow P$, $F_{n}(x)\to F(x)$ at
all points $x\in\mathbb{R}$ where $F$ is continuous, which is
everywhere since $F\ll\lambda$ ($\lambda$ denoting Lebesgue
measure). (Furthermore, since each $F_{n}$ is also continuous, the
pointwise convergence $F_{n}\to F$ is uniform in any compact set.) This seems to limit our options. For example, it implies that
$P_{n}(A)\to P(A)$ whenever $A$ can be written as a finite union of
intervals. Perhaps a countable union of intervals
could work. Since we are dealing with probability measures, though,
the component intervals 'running off to $\infty$' seems unlikely to
help. Because $F_{n}$, $F$ are absolutely continuous with respect to
$\lambda$, they have densities $f_{n}$, $f$. If $f_{n}\to f$ too
nicely (e.g. in such a way that allowed us to apply the Monotone or
Dominated Convergence Theorem), we'd find that
$P_{n}(A)=\int_{A}f_{n}\,\mathrm{d}\lambda$ converged to
$\int_{A}f\,\mathrm{d}\lambda=P(A)$ for any Borel set $A$. Thinking
along these lines, I looked around unsuccessfully for a kind of 
counterpart to Scheffé's Theorem , which says If $f_{n}\to f$ $\lambda$-a.e., then $P_{n}(A)\to P(A)$ for all $A\in\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ (and the rate of convergence is uniform). The Portmanteau Theorem tells us that if $P_{n}\Rightarrow P$, then
$P_{n}(A)\to P(A)$ for all Borel sets $A$ satisfying
$\lambda(\partial A)=0$. Fat Cantor sets are Borel sets whose
boundaries (themselves) have positive Lebesgue measure, so maybe
$P$ could be defined in terms of a fat Cantor set and each $P_{n}$
in terms of some step in its construction or something.","['probability-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'weak-convergence']"

This definition is pretty clear to me. In particular, giving a section of $U_i$ is the same as giving a polynomial in the $x_j/x_i$, which is to say a polynomial in the $x_j/x_i$. This is the same as giving an element of $k[x_0, \dots,x_n]$ localized at $(x_i)$ such that the degree of the numerator and denominator is the same. The difference between $\mathcal{O}(m)$ and $\mathcal{O}$ appears in their global structure which we see in the transition functions. In Hartshorne's book he defines the same sheaf as follows (chapter II section 5). Let $S = k[x_0, \dots, x_n]$ and let $S(m)$ be $S$ with the grading twisted by $m$. Then $\mathcal{O}(m)$ is the sheaf on Proj $S$ associated to $S(m)$, which on open sets $U$ is given by the set of functions $U \to \coprod_{p\in U} S(m)_{(p)}$ that are locally fractions, where $S(m)_{(p)}$ is the localization of $S(m)$ at the set of homogeneous elements of $S$ not in $p$. By my reading of this definition, a section of $U_i$ is then a rational function $f/x_i^r$ where the degree of $f$ (as a polynomial) is $r+m$. This contradicts my understanding from Vakil's definition. What have I missed?",['algebraic-geometry']

1364076,Integrable functions that take values in a Banach space,"Let $\mathbb K$ be $\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C$.
Let $(X, \mathcal M, \mu)$ be a measure space and let $F$ be a Banach space over $\mathbb K$.
I would like to define an integral of a function $f:X \rightarrow F$ that satisfies suitable conditions. My method is motivated by Bourbaki's Integration.
They assume that $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space and $\mu$ is a Radon measure.
So mine is sort of a generalization of their definition of the integral. If $g: X \rightarrow [0, \infty]$ is a non-negative extended real-valued function, we denote by $\int^* g d\mu$ the upper integral of $g$(for the definition of the upper integral, see Lebesgue's monotone convergence theorem for upper integrals ). We denote by $\mathcal F(X, F)$ the set of functions $X\rightarrow F$.
It is a vector space over $\mathbb K$.
If $f\in \mathcal F(X, F)$, then we denote $N_1(f) = \int^* |f(x)| d\mu(x)$.
We denote by $\mathcal F^1(X, F)$ the set $\{f\in \mathcal F(X, F): N_1(f) \lt \infty\}$. Then $\mathcal F^1(X, F)$ is a vector subspace of $\mathcal F(X, F)$.
It is easy to see that $N_1$ is a seminorm on $\mathcal F^1(X, F)$.
It can be proved by using Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem for upper integrals( Lebesgue's monotone convergence theorem for upper integrals ) that 
$\mathcal F^1(X, F)$ is complete with the seminorm $N_1$(you just mimic the proof of the corresponding theorem in Bourbaki's Integration). A function $f: X\rightarrow F$ is called a simple function if $f(X)$ is a finite set and $f^{-1}(a) \in \mathcal M$ for all $a\in f(X)$.
$f$ is said to have a finite support if $\mu(f^{-1}(a)) \lt \infty$ for all $a\in f(X) - \{0\}$.
Let $\mathcal S$ be the set of simple functions of finite support.
It is a subspace of $\mathcal F^1(X, F)$.
We denote by $\mathcal L^1(X, F)$ the closure of $\mathcal S$ in $\mathcal F^1(X, F)$ with respect to the seminorm $N_1$. If $f\in \mathcal S$, we can define $\int f d\mu \in F$ in the obvious way.
Since $|\int f d\mu| \le \int |f(x)| d\mu(x) = N_1(f)$, the map $\psi: \mathcal S\rightarrow F$ defined by $\psi(f) = \int f d\mu$ is a continuous linear map.
Since $\mathcal S$ is dense in $\mathcal L^1(X, F)$ and $F$ is a Banach space, $\psi$ can be extended to a unique continuous linear map $\phi: \mathcal L^1(X, F)\rightarrow F$.
We call an element $f \in \mathcal L^1(X, F)$ integrable and call $\phi(f)$ its integral. We denote $\phi(f)$ by $\int f d\mu$ or $\int f(x) d\mu(x)$. Now I would like to find some criteria to determine when a function $X \rightarrow F$ is integrable.
A function $f:X\rightarrow F$ is said to be $\mathcal B(F)$-measurable if $f^{-1}(U) \in \mathcal M$ for all open subsets $U$ of $F$, where $\mathcal B(F)$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by all open subsets of $F$. A function $f:X\rightarrow F$ is said to be Bochner measurable if it satisfies the following condition. There exists a sequence of simple functions $f_n,n=1,2,\cdots$ defined on $X$ such that $f(x) = \text{lim}_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n(x)$ almost everywhere on $X$. It can be proved that an integrable function is Bochner measurable(you just mimic the Bourbaki's proof of the corresponding fact). Conversely suppose $f$ is a Bochner measurable function.
There exists a null set $N$ and a sequence of simple functions $f_n, n = 1, 2, \cdots$ such that $f(x) = \text{lim}_{n\rightarrow \infty} f_n(x)$ for all $x\in X - N$.
Since the pointwise limit of a sequence of $\mathcal B(F)$-measurable functions is $\mathcal B(F)$-measurable(see Limit of measurable functions is measurable? ), if we redefine $f$ as $f(x) = 0$ for $x \in N$, then $f$ is $\mathcal B(F)$-measurable.
Hence the function $x \rightarrow |f(x)|$ is measurable.
If $\int |f(x)| d\mu \lt \infty$, it seems to me that $f$ is integrable in our sense. How do you prove this if it is correct?","['functional-analysis', 'measure-theory']"
1364080,Comparison of integrals,"Under what conditions on $f$ can we conclude the following inequality: $$\left(\int_a^b f \, \mathrm{d}x\right)^2 \leq \int_a^b f^2 \, \mathrm{d}x.$$ Cauchy-Schwarz looked appealing at first:
$$\left(\int_a^b fg \, \mathrm{d}x \right)^2 \leq \left(\int_a^b f^2 \, \mathrm{d}x\right)\left(\int_a^b g^2 \, \mathrm{d}x\right).$$
Setting $g \equiv 1$, we get
$$\left(\int_a^b f \, \mathrm{d}x \right)^2 \leq (b-a)\left(\int_a^b f^2 \, \mathrm{d}x\right),$$
so if $b - a \leq 1$, we are done. But what about for more general intervals? I think the answer lies in a more clever substitution/manipulation.

1364470,What tactics could help with this probability questions,"I'm not too sure if this question is solvable (I sort of just thought of it yesterday) but when I brute force numerical answers on my computer they seem to show a pattern, so I believe it to be solvable. The question: I have $N$ people in a stadium, and there are $5$ different coloured shirts. Each person has an equal chance of wearing any of the coloured shirts. (i.e. it's equally likely that you'll find a guy with a black shirt, than a blue or pink or grey or brown shirt). The love god suddenly starts playing music across the stadium, and every single person suddenly has an unresistable desire to pair up with a person who is wearing a same coloured shirt. Find the probability that nobody is left alone. (equivalent to asking find the probability that the number of people wearing each colour is an even number). Trivial Observations: If $N$ is odd, then the chance is $0$, only if $N$ is even is the chance finite. In fact (for the case where there are $5$ different coloured shirts), if $N$ is odd, the colours can end with only $3$ combinations (all odd, $3$ odd $2$ even, $4$ odd $1$ even) and for $N$ is even - (all even, $4$ odd $1$ even, $2$ odd $3$ even). A (seemingly crucial) observation: It seems that if I increase $N$ to an arbitrarily large amount, that the probability that all the colours are even at the end should asymptote for some value, because the bulk majority of people just pair off. I started my solution by attempting to prove this point. To do this, I assumed that at the beginning all $100$ people were shirtless, and we would add the shirts on to the people one by one. We will keep a 'lonely counter' that keeps count of all lonely people, and the moment someone gets paired they immediately are forgotten from memory for all we care. For the first person, the color shirt he chooses is arbitrary, because he will definitely be lonely, so our lonely counter is at $1$. The next person has a $0.2$ chance of picking the same shirt as the first person (in this case the lonely counter drops to $0$), and a $0.8$ chance of picking a different colour (in this case the lonely counter goes up to $2$). The maximum lonely counter value is $5$, and for the case where we want $0$ lonely people, by the time we are done assigning shirt values to everybody the lonely counter must again be at $0$. To test my asymptotic theory, I pretty much put this 'lonely counter' into excel to see what happens At $N = 0$, the lonely counter is $0$ with a $100\%$ probability (no people around). At $N = 1$, the lonely counter is $1$ with a $100\%$ probability (1 person by himself definitely lonely). At $N = 2$, the lonely counter is $0$ with $0.2$ chance, and $2$ with $0.8$ chance (as explained above). With math and excel magic I ran the data along, and wondrously, the chance the lonely counter was $0$ asymptoted toward a value of $6.25\%$. Then I tried for different numbers of shirts, and found a trend, so unless I messed up my math then I believe $$ P = \dfrac{1}{2^{p-1}} $$ For large $N$, and where $p$ is the number of shirts. I tried to use my lonely counter to actually prove the result though, and I'm sort of stuck now, and not really sure where to go from here. Any help is appreciated.","['probability', 'combinatorics']"
1364471,Do the matrices with maximum determinant always have integral values?,"Consider all $n$ by $n$ matrices whose elements are real values in $[0,1]$.  Now for a given $n$, consider all those matrices with maximum determinant. Are all the elements of these matrices always either exactly $0$ or $1$? From numerical experiments this seems to be the case but I don't see how to prove it. A very nice counterexample was given to my question as I didn't phrase it correctly. It should have been: Can the maximum determinant always be reached by a matrix with only
  $1$ and $0$ entries?","['determinant', 'linear-algebra', 'matrices']"
1364484,Continuity of distance function [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Distance to a set is continuous, revisited (1 answer) Closed 2 years ago . I wonder if this is obvious because it does not appear to me obvious at all: Reference: [Hormander: An introduction to Complex Analysis in Several Variables], page 37: Here is the quote Now, let $\delta$ be an arbitrary continuous function in
  $\mathbb{C}^n$ such that $\delta>0$ except at $0$, and 
  $$\delta(tz)=|t|\delta(z)$$ for all $t\in\mathbb{C}$ and
  $z\in\mathbb{C}^n$. Set 
  $$\delta(z,\Omega^c)=\inf_{w\in\Omega^c}\delta(z-w).$$ It is obvious
  that this is continuous. Why should this be obvious?? First I know it should be clear that $\delta(z,\Omega)$ is upper semicontinuous becase it is defined to be the infinimum over a family of continuous functions. But it is not yet clear to me that this should be lower semicontinuous as well. Any hints?

1364512,"What characterizes the equivalence classes of the quotient ring, P(N)/Fin(N)?","Let P(N) be the powerset of the natural numbers.  Let Fin(N) be the collection of all finite subsets of N. Then (P(N),symmetric difference, intersection) is a ring. I am taking my first course in ring theory (so I am not sure if I am using the correct terminology). I think I have made an interesting observation about the cosets of Fin(N).  My claim is that for subsets A and B in P(N),  A + Fin(N) = B + Fin(N) implies that there is a positive integer m such that for all n>=m, n is an element of BOTH A and B or n is in NEITHER A nor B.  In other words, if we compare A and B we eventually get to a point where they contain the same integers.  Does anyone agree/disagree? One reason I think this is interesting is that it illustrates a 1-1 correspondence between the cosets of Fin(N) (which themselves contain an infinite number of elements) and P(N).","['ring-theory', 'elementary-set-theory']"
1364517,Continuous dependence on an initial condition (SDE),"Let's say I have a (one-dimensional) diffusion process $$dX=\mu(X_t)dt+\sigma(X_t)dW.$$ Assume we have fixed $\epsilon > 0$ and $t >0$
Under what conditions is $\mathbb{P}^x(X_t < \epsilon)$ going to be a continuous function of $x$? Here, $\mathbb{P}^x(\cdot)$ denotes $\mathbb{P}(\cdot |X_0=x)$ as usual. I know I already asked a similar question, however, I demanded the marginal distribution function to be smooth, although I later realized I can relax that condition if I work a bit differently. There are some articles (as I mentioned before) that mention continuous dependence on initial data, specifically this one ( http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0219025702000870 ). However, the scope is very general and the article deals with  evolution equations, I would very much prefer to be able to find similar results for finite-dimensional diffusions since I am not very well versed in infinite-dimensional SDEs. What I actually want to have at the end is to have this result not for a fixed $t$, but for a stopping time which also depends on the process. The stopping time is sort of ""exponentially distributed with a continuous rate"" by which I mean that conditioned on the path of the diffusion it has a density $f(t)=\lambda(X_t)e^{-\int_0^t\lambda(X_s)ds}$, where $\lambda$ is a continuous non-negative function. Perhaps there is a proper name for such a distribution. In any case, I am interested in anything that can be said (from general statements to particular restrictive examples) about the continuity of the marginal distribution as a function of the initial condition.

1364526,Is outer measure a measure?,"In my text book Lebesgue measure is shown to have countable additivity on disjoint sets, i.e. if $A_k$ is a countable sequence of disjoint measurable sets, then $\mu(\bigcup A_k)=\sum\mu(A_k)$. Thus Lebesgue measure is a measure with an additional property that the empty set has zero measure. But for outer measure, my text book never says outer measure is a measure, and it does not say anything if outer measure has countable additivity on disjoint sets.

Is it true that there's a constant $C>1$ independent of $\theta$ and choice of $\{a_n\}$ such that $a_0^2+\sum_{n>0}(a_n-\theta a_{n-1})^2\ge C$? Discussion It's a result needed for estimation of roots of a monic polynomial. Suppose the sum $\sum_{n>0}(a_n-\theta a_{n-1})^2$ converges, then $a_n/a_{n-1}$ is a Diophantine approximation of $\theta$, so maybe a characterization of the speed of Diophantine approximation will work. And maybe the condition that $\theta$ is an algebraic integer is irrelevant. I mean, maybe it holds for every irrational number $\theta>1$. Any idea? Thanks! EDIT As Robert Israel pointed out, the original version, as was written, $\sum_n(a_n-\theta a_{n-1})^2\ge C$ is wrong (that was not a typo, but my shortage of understanding the problem), for $a_j=F_{n+j}$ and $\theta=(1+\sqrt 5)/2$.

1364617,Instrumental Variables and orthogonality conditions,"To obtain the method of moment estimate for instrument variables,
we use the moment condition $z'\varepsilon=0$ in the exact identified
case (number of endogenous variables = number of instruments) or $\hat{x}'\varepsilon=0$
in the overidentified case where the hat represents ttted value of
the endogenous variable in a first stage regression on the instrumets.
We use the sample counterpart and replace the true errors by the residuals.
In the former case, we obtain $\hat{\beta}_{IV}=(z'x)^{-1}(z'y)$
and in the latter $\hat{\beta}_{2\mathrm{SLS}}=(\hat{x}'\hat{x})^{-1}(\hat{x}'y)$.
The intuition for the usual Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions
is that we regress the endogenous variable on the instruments in the
first stage, obtain the predicted value of the endogenous variables,
use these predicted values in the second stage on the RHS and obtain
the (possibly) unbiased and conistent estimate of our parameters.
We then use this estimate of the paramaters to obtain unbiased estimates
of the true errors (the residuals in the second stage) and run the
following regression: $e=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 z_1+\cdots+\alpha_k z_k+u_k$
where $e$ represent the residuals (unbiased estimates of the true
errors) and $z$ represent the various instruments. We then run a usual $NR^2$ test to test the joint significance
of the instruments. If instruments are valid, then we should not be
able to reject the null of orthogonality. My question is that shouldnt
this always be the case by construction? After all, we use this specific
moment condition in the first place! Any help is much appreciated.",['statistics']
1364629,"What does it mean when two sets are ""adjoined"" in a metric space?","I encountered the word ""adjoined"" in Baby Rudin, Chapter 2 concerning basic topology on Euclidean space. It appeared in the proof to Theorem 2.35 Theorem $\quad$ Closed subsets of compact sets are compact Proof $\quad$ Suppose $F\subset K\subset X$ , $F$ is closed (relative to $X$ ), and $K$ is compact. Let $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ be an open cover of $F$ . If $F^c$ is adjoined to $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ ,we obtain an open cover $\Omega$ of $K$ . Since $K$ is compact, there is a finite subcollection $\Phi$ of $\Omega$ which covers $K$ , and hence $F$ . If $F^c$ is a member of $\Phi$ , we may remove it from $\Phi$ and still retain an open cover of $F$ . We have thus shown that a finite subcollection of $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ covers $F$ . First, to be honest I don't understand the meaning of ""adjoined"", I guess it might mean that the two sets are ""complementary"" except for the ""boundary"" between them. If this is what ""adjoined"" means, then I am still confused. Because since $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ is an open cover of $F$ , and $F^c$ is open. If these two open sets are ""adjoined"", then neither of them includes $\partial F$ , which is absurd. So it might be that I just failed to understand the word ""adjoined"" properly.

Has someone studied or run across literature that discusses the properties of random variables transformed by their own distribution functions? One interpretation I can see is that $E[Y]$ gives the degree of ""concentration"" of the random variable $X$.
