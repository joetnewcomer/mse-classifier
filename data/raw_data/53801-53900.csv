572324,Hilbert's Hotel and Infinities for Pre-university Students,"Hilbert's paradox of the grand hotel is a fun and exciting ground to base a talk on the set theoretic concept of infinity for interested students - even in middle- and high school. However, it does not deal with the question that whether there are different infinities or not. Question 1. Is it necessary to talk about uncountability of $\mathbb{R}$ after a session on  Hilbert's hotel paradox? Question 2. When teaching gifted middle school students, is it appropriate to use Cantor's diagonal argument to prove that $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable? Can one hope the students grasp the idea of the proof? How can the idea be illuminated?","['education', 'cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory', 'infinity']"
572331,Root of $f(z)$ inside $|z|<1$,"Let $c\in\mathbb{R}$. A non-constant function $f(z)$ is holomorphic in $|z|<2$. Suppose $|f(z)|=c$ for all $|z|=1$. Show that  $f(z)$ must have a root in $|z|<1$. I'm thinking about the maximum principle, which says $f(z)$ cannot attain a maximum inside $|z|<1$. But that still doesn't yield a root.

572415,Stability of Analytic Continuation,"Let $f(z)$ be an analytic function in an open set $U\subset\Bbb{C}$.  Recall that an analytic continuation of $f$ is a pair $(F,V)$ such that $U\subset V\subset\Bbb{C}$, $F$ is analytic on $V$, and $F(z)=f(z)$ for all $z\in U$. My question is, how stable is this process?  If $\|f-g\|$ is small, are we guaranteed $\|F-G\|$ small in any reasonable sense?  If not, are there easy counterexamples?  If the answer depends on the choice of norm, I would find that interesting as well. References gladly accepted in lieu of obvious arguments.  Thanks!","['reference-request', 'complex-analysis']"

I don't really know where to start with this one. I know that $p(0)=det(0*I_{n}-A)=det(-A)=(-1)^{n}*det(A)$, thus if both $p(0)$ and $det(0) = 0$ then $0$ is an eigenvalue of A and A is not invertible. If neither are $0$, then $0$ is not an eigenvalue of A and thus A is invertible. I'm unsure of how to use this information to prove $\vec{v}$ is also an eigenvector for $A^{-1}$ and how to find a corresponding eigenvalue.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'determinant']"
572523,Everything in the Power Set is measurable?,"Im taking a class in graduate probability. My background is in engineering (very used to math in an applied sense). I am also taking an undergraduate class in real analysis along side (should have taken it before, but I couldn't) I have a couple of questions: We're spending time looking at measurable functions on measurable
sets. The definition of a ""measurable set"" is one who lies in a
sigma algebra. My conceptual understanding of a sigma algebra (I 
know the technical def: countable additivity, etc.) is the resolution
with which we understand a certain space - the sets that can be measured - even more simply: the sets we can actually use .     We
say a sigma algebra is the ""domain"" of our measure. In other words, a (prob) measure can't measure just any old arbitrary set/sets
of set. We define a sigma algebra to handle this, and say our measure
operates over this sigma algebra. However, the power set is actually 
a sigma algebra (the largest one, according to our definition), and yet not every element of the power set is measurable? I'm having a little trouble reconciling my conceptual understanding of a sigma algebra (the behave good-measurable sets) with its actual def (which 
gives us the power set dilemma). How does the Borel Sigma Algebra fit into this conceptual understanding? How about non measurable sets? Is there a concept of the largest sigma algebra of only measurable sets, which is a subset of the power set?","['measure-theory', 'probability']"
572528,How to compute the eigenvalues of a block matrix with a special structure and when the submatrices are square.,"I have the next block matrix $$
M = \begin{bmatrix}A & B \\ C &D\end{bmatrix},
$$
where $A, D$ are Hurwitz (eigenvalues with negative real part) square matrices of different dimensions and $B, C$ have the right dimensions. Furthermore, we have the next relations $B D^{-1} C = 0$, $BC = 0$ and $CB=0$, where $0$ stands for the appropriated zero matrix. I know that $\det(M) = \det(D) \det(A-B D^{-1} C)=\det(D) \det(A)$. Can I say something about the eigenvalues of $M$ given this special structure? I guess this is the right characteristic polynomial right? $\lambda(M) = \det(D-\lambda I)\det((A-\lambda I)-B (D-\lambda I)^{-1} C)$ . I do not know if $B (D-\lambda I)^{-1} C$ could be nicely approximated, simplified or considered as a perturbation (small) matrix? And what about the next special case, if $A, B, C, D$ are square matrices with the same dimensions, can be simplified in some way the characteristic polynomial? i.e. is true for such case that $\lambda(M) = \det(A-\lambda I)\det(D -\lambda I) - \det(B)\det(C) = \det(A-\lambda I)\det(D -\lambda I) - \det(BC) \\

But it occurred to me that I don't actually understand how this is possible, because the substitution I made is not injective! In this case the integral is indefinite, but what if I were trying to integrate over some interval? Couldn't a non-injective substitution destroy important information - for example, eliminating signs if I square a variable - or something like that, thus giving the wrong answer?","['calculus', 'integration', 'indefinite-integrals']"
572553,Exercise 3.18 of Fulton's Algebraic curves.,"I'm trying to provide a proof of the following fact: If $p$ is a simple point on the curve $F$ then $I(p,F\cap G)=ord_p^F(G)$. Where $I(p,F\cap G)$ denotes the intersection number of the curves at $p$, and $ord_p^F$ is the order function in the discrete valuation ring $\mathcal O_p(F)$. The goal is use only the seven properties of the intersection numbers that him describes in the book. I have tried with the special case when $p$ is a simple point on $G$ and $F$, $G$ don't share any tangent at $p$; in which case the intersection number is one. But I don't know how to calculate $ord_p^F(G)$ in this simple case,  I even reduce the problem to $G$ irreducible but with no success. In fact I'm having problems with calculations of this kind, when the function $ord$ is involved; I would be very grateful with an answer that helps me in this aspect.

572564,Any irreducible representation of a $p$-group over a field of characteristic $p$ is trivial.,"In general, we know that if $G$ is a finite group and $K$ is a field, then $K[G]$ (the group algebra) is semisimple whenever $\operatorname{char}(K)$ does not divide the order of $G$.  However, this result does not hold when we have a $p$-group and a finite field of characteristic $p$. How would I go about showing that an irreducible representation of a $p$-group $G$ over a field $K$ of characteristic $p$ must be the trivial representation? It seems like this would perhaps entail some sort of application of Maschke's Theorem to get a contradiction.   I know that $|G| = \sum_i \operatorname{dim}(V_i)^2$, where $V_i$ is an irreducible representation. But it seems like that does not help me much here.

572568,Probability that a vertex in the spanning tree of an $N$ x $N$ grid graph is a leaf,"Suppose we have an $N$ x $N$ grid graph $G(V,E)$ and we construct a spanning tree of this graph in the following way. Start with a set $S$ which contains only the vertex at the top left corner of the grid graph (i.e location $(0,0)$), and an empty set $T$ which will contain our spanning tree. Now pick an edge at random (with equal probability) from the set of  edges $(p,q)\in E(G)$ such that $p \in S$ and $q \not \in S$. Add this edge to our set $T$ and add $q$ to set $S$, repeat this process until we obtain a spanning tree. Now, the problem is this: What is the probability that a given vertex of the grid graph at location $(x,y)$ is a leaf in our spanning tree? In general, what is the expected number of leafs in a spanning tree constructed in this way? If this problem is too difficult, what can we say about a smaller grid? For example if we consider an $N$ x $2$, $N$ x $3$, ... e.t.c grid graph Note: This was inspired by a more general question asked by Nick Wu on Quora","['algorithmic-randomness', 'random-variables', 'algorithms', 'graph-theory', 'probability']"

I'm unsure of how to proceed with this though. I know that the slope of the tangent line is equal to $\frac{dy}{dx}$ at any point on the curve. So the slope of the tangent line would be: $$y'=\frac{(x-3)(1)-(x)(1)}{(x-3)^2}=\frac{-3}{(x-3)^2}$$ I also know that the product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is $-1.$ I'm not sure how to apply this to the problem, and also I'm not sure about how to find $x$- and $y$-coordinates.

To see how this area looks like, I uploaded a picture from WolframAlpha: As you can see, it is quite egg-like.

572863,Show that the union over a collection of compact cubes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is Lebesgue measurable,"Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a (not necessarily countable) collection of compact cubes in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Show that $\cup\{K:K\in \mathcal{K}\}$ is a Lebesgue set (Measurable with respect to the Lebesgue measure). If the union is countable the argument is quite simple: each $K\in \mathcal{K}$ is closed and thus a Borel set (i.e. belongs to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra), and since $\sigma$-algebras are closed under countable unions, $S=\cup\{K:K\in \mathcal{K}\}$ is a Borel set. Since every Borel set is Lebesgue measurable, we are done. Thus, WLOG we can assume that $\mathcal{K}$ is an uncountable family. The hint given is to use the Vitali Covering theorem. I am not quite sure how to work this out yet but have a few ideas. My main idea is to use the fact that every Lebesgue measurable set can be written as the union of a Borel set and a set of Lebesgue measure zero, and every set that can be written in such a form is Lebesgue measurable. We can take $V=\{C\subset \mathbb{R}^n: C $ is a compact cube s.t. $C\subset K$ some $K\in \mathcal{K}\}$. This gives a Vitali covering of $S$, and so by the Vitali covering theorem there exists a sequence of pairwise disjoint cubes $C_1,C_2,...\in V$ such that $\cup_j C_j$ contains $\lambda_n$-almost every point of $\mathcal{K}$. Then $\mathcal{K}=\mathcal{K}\cap \left( \cup_j C_j\right)\cup \left(\mathcal{K}-\cup_j C_j \right)=\cup_j C_j \cup \left(\mathcal{K}-\cup_j C_j\right)$
(The last equality holding by how $V$ is defined). Since $\cup_j C_j$ is a Borel set (being a countable union of closed sets), and 
$\mathcal{K}-\cup_j C_j$ is a Lebesgue null set, $\mathcal{K}$ is a Lebesgue set.","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"

573203,Why is the modular $\lambda$ function a quotient of two meromorphic functions in the U.H.P.?,"In Ahlfors' complex analysis text, page 278 it says: It is quite clear from (9) that $\lambda(\tau)$ is the quotient of two analytic functions in the upper half plane $\text{Im} \tau > 0$. Formula (9) is the definition of the Weierstrass $\wp$ function $$\wp(z;\omega_1, \omega_2)=\frac{1}{z^2}+ \sum_{\omega \neq 0} \frac{1}{(z-\omega)^2}-\frac{1}{\omega^2} $$
where the sum is taken over all linear combinations $$\omega=n_1 \omega_1+n_2 \omega_2 $$ with integer coefficients (except the zero combination). The $\lambda$ function is defined as $$\lambda(\tau)= \frac{e_3-e_2}{e_1-e_2} $$ where $e_1=\wp(\omega_1/2),e_2=\wp(\omega_2/2),e_3=\wp((\omega_1+\omega_2)/2)$, and $\tau$ is the ratio $\omega_2/\omega_1$. My attempt: Following the author's advice I found that $\lambda$ equals $$\frac{\frac{1}{\left( \frac{\omega_1+\omega_2}{2} \right)^2}+\sum \left[ \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\omega_1+\omega_2}{2}-n_1 \omega_1-n_2 \omega_2 \right)^2}-\frac{1}{\left( n_1 \omega_1+n_2 \omega_2 \right)^2} \right]-\frac{1}{\left( \frac{\omega_2}{2} \right)^2}- \sum \left[ \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\omega_2}{2}-n_1 \omega_1-n_2 \omega_2 \right)^2}-\frac{1}{\left( n_1 \omega_1+n_2 \omega_2 \right)^2}\right]}{\frac{1}{\left( \frac{\omega_1}{2} \right)^2}+\sum \left[ \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\omega_1}{2}-n_1 \omega_1-n_2 \omega_2 \right)^2}-\frac{1}{\left( n_1 \omega_1+n_2 \omega_2 \right)^2} \right]-\frac{1}{\left( \frac{\omega_2}{2} \right)^2}-\sum \left[ \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\omega_2}{2}-n_1 \omega_1-n_2 \omega_2 \right)^2}-\frac{1}{\left( n_1 \omega_1+n_2 \omega_2 \right)^2} \right]}  $$ multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by $\omega_1^2$ we get the numerator $$ \frac{1}{\left( \frac{1+\tau}{2} \right)^2}+\sum \left[ \frac{1}{\left( \frac{1+\tau}{2}-n_1-n_2 \tau \right)^2}-\frac{1}{\left( n_1 +n_2 \tau \right)^2} \right]-\frac{1}{\left( \frac{\tau}{2} \right)^2}- \sum \left[ \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\tau}{2}-n_1-n_2 \tau \right)^2}-\frac{1}{\left( n_1 +n_2 \tau \right)^2}\right]$$ and the denominator $$\frac{1}{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2}+\sum \left[ \frac{1}{\left( \frac{1}{2}-n_1 -n_2 \tau \right)^2}-\frac{1}{\left( n_1+n_2 \tau \right)^2} \right]-\frac{1}{\left( \frac{\tau}{2} \right)^2}-\sum \left[ \frac{1}{\left( \frac{\tau}{2}-n_1-n_2 \tau \right)^2}-\frac{1}{\left( n_1 +n_2 \tau \right)^2} \right] $$ I think the next step is proving that both the numerator and denominator are analytic as a function of $\tau$ in $\Im \tau>0$. Firstly, I don't know how to do that, and secondly, shouldn't they be analytic for $\Im \tau<0$ as well?

573318,"Should a ""good"" equation divide the plane?","At the question Is there any equation for triangle? (MSE) the answer given by Henning Makholm received the most upvotes. Therefore let's define the following triangle function $H$ with (a,b,c) the vertices of the triangle and $x$ an arbitrary point in the plane (all vectors):
$$
   H(x) = \big(|x-a|+|x-b|-|a-b|\big)
          \big(|x-b|+|x-c|-|b-c|\big)
          \big(|x-c|+|x-a|-|c-a|\big)
$$
Due to the triangle equality, the outcomes between the parentheses $\big(\big)$ are always
positive or zero, hence the product $H(x)$ is always positive or zero, regardless of the
following question: is $x$ inside or outside the triangle ? The triangle function
$H(x)$ only discriminates between $H(x)=0$ at an edge or $H(x)>0$ not at an edge of the triangle. Now take a look at a common equation describing a circle with midpoint (vector) $a$ and
radius $R$. Let $x$ be a point (vector) in the plane. Define the circle function C(x) as:
$$
   C(x) = |x-a| - R
$$
Then for points at the circle $C(x) = 0$, for points inside the circle $C(x) < 0$
and for points outside the circle $C(x) > 0$. The circle equation divides the plane . Note. It is of course true that dividing the plane can be circumvented by proposing an equation like:
$$
   C(x) = (|x-a| - R)^2
$$
But it seems not to be quite natural to do so. Next take a look at the common function equation $y = f(x)$ , which can also be written as:
$$ z = F(x,y) = y - f(x) = 0
$$
The (graph of the) function $y = f(x)$ divides the plane in a positive and a negative region. And such is also the case with many common equations for straight lines, parabolas,
hyperbolas, ellipses and so on and so forth. Still another example is in Fermat's proof for $x^3 - y^2 = 2$ :
$$
   f(x,y) = x^3 - y^2 - 2
$$
Then for example $(x,y) = (0,0) \rightarrow f(x,y) < 0$ and $(x,y) = (2,2) \rightarrow f(x,y) > 0$. The equation
divides the plane. But Henning's triangle equation does not divide the plane. Another triangle equation has
been proposed as an answer to the abovementioned question and this equation does divide the plane. Question. Should a ""good"" equation $F(x,y) = 0$ divide the plane ? Or is it just my personal bias ?","['inequality', 'algebra-precalculus', 'plane-curves', 'graphing-functions', 'soft-question']"

573372,Continuity in the Krylov-Bogoliubov theorem,"I have the following proof of the Krylov-Bogoliubov theorem, which asserts that given a compact metric space $X$ endowed with a continuous transformation $T \colon X \to X$ one can find a $T$-invariant Borel probability measure $\mu$: Let $$S_f^N(x) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} f(T^n(x))$$ and fix $x \in X$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a countable dense subset of $\mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$. Using a diagonalization argument and the fact that $f(X)$ is bounded, it's easy to prove that there exists a strictly increasing sequence $N_k$ such that $S_f^{N_k}(x)$ converges for every $f \in \mathcal{F}$. Because $\mathcal{F}$ is dense in the uniform topology, $S_g^{N_k}(x)$ also converges for every $g \in \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$. Let $S_g(x) = \lim_{k \to \infty} S_g^{N_k}(x)$. Let $L_x(g) = S_g(x)$. Then $L_x \colon \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R}) \to \mathcal{R}$ is a continuous positive linear functional. By the Riesz representation theorem, there is a regular measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal{B}(X)$ such that $$L_x(g) = \int_X g d\mu$$ for every $g \in \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$. A simple computation shows that $L_x(g \circ T) = L_x(g)$ for every $g \in \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$, so $$\int_X g d\nu = \int_X g \circ T d\mu = \int_X g d\mu$$ for every $g \in \mathcal{C}(X, \mathbb{R})$, where $\nu = \mu(T^{-1}(\cdot))$. Since $\nu$ is a finite measure and $X$ is compact and metrizable, it follows that $\nu$ is also regular. This proves that $\mu = \nu$, so $\mu$ is $T$-invariant. My problem is that this proof doesn't seem to need the continuity of $T$, whereas there are examples that show that measurability alone isn't enough for the proof. What am I missing?

573694,Bayesian posterior with truncated normal prior,"Suppose we observe one draw from the random variable $X$, which is distributed with normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$. The variance $\sigma^2$ is known, $\mu$ isn't. We want to estimate $\mu$. Suppose further that the prior distribution is given by truncated normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu_0,\sigma^2_0,t)$, i.e., density $f(\mu)=c/\sigma \phi((\mu-\mu_0)/\sigma_0)$ if $\mu<t$, and $f(\mu)=0$ otherwise, where $t>\mu$ and $c$ is a normalizing constant. (Interpretation: we get noisy signals about $\mu$, which are known to be normally distributed with known variance---this is the draw of $X$. But we have prior knowledge that values $\mu\ge t$ are not possible.) In this setup, is the resulting posterior a truncated normal distribution (truncated at $t$ like the prior)? I tried to adapt the derivation of the posterior for the well known conjugate normal pair (e.g., here and here ), and it seems to work. Do you see any mistake in this derivation? The likelihood function is given by 
$$f(x|\mu)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left\{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right\} $$
The prior density is ($\Phi(.)$ is the cdf of the standard normal distribution)
$$f(\mu)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sigma_0\sqrt{2\pi}\Phi((t-\mu_0)/\sigma_0)} \exp\left\{-\frac{(\mu-\mu_0)^2}{2\sigma_0^2} \right\} &\text{ if } \mu\le t \\
0 & \text{else}.
\end{cases}$$
The prior density can be rewritten as 
$$f(\mu)=c \phi((\mu-\mu_0)/\sigma_0)\mathbf{1}\{\mu<t\},$$
where $c$ is the normalizing constant (independent of $\mu$, but dependent on $t$). Now, by Bayes' rule,
\begin{equation}
f(\mu|x)\propto f(x|\mu) f(\mu)\propto\exp\left\{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right\} \exp\left\{-\frac{(\mu-\mu_0)^2}{2\sigma_0^2} \right\}\mathbf{1}\{\mu<t\} \\

This is the kernel of the normal distribution with the usual mean and variance (as if we had done the derivation for an untruncated prior), but truncated at $t$ and above. In other words, ignoring the truncation in the prior distribution, using the usual learning rule for the conjugate normal pair, and then applying the truncation gives the same result as the derivation above (assuming it is correct). Is it correct? All I do is add the indicator function (and adapt the normalizing constant), does that introduce problems somewhere?","['bayes-theorem', 'bayesian', 'statistics', 'normal-distribution', 'probability']"

Then $\ln(e^a) = \ln(e^b)$ Then $a\ln(e) = b\ln(e)$ This means that $a = b$ Hence, $f$ is injective.

Below is the definition of the fundamental group for a simple algebraic group $G$. Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group over a field $k$, and fix a maximal torus $T\subset G$.  The adjoint action of $T$ on $\mathfrak{g}=\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ gives a root space decomposition of $\mathfrak{g}$ which corresponds to an abstract root system $\Phi$ inside of $E=\mathbb{R}\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}X(T)$.  Here $X(T)$ is the free abelian group of characters of $T$. Inside of $E$ there are abstract weights which are defined to be all $\lambda\in E$ such that $\langle \lambda,\alpha\rangle\in\mathbb{Z}$ for all $\alpha\in\Phi$, where $$\langle\lambda,\alpha\rangle=\frac{2(\lambda,\alpha)}{(\alpha,\alpha)}$$ and $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the (unique?) inner-product on $E$ relative to which the Weyl group $W(\Phi)$ consists of orthogonal transformations.  Let $\Lambda$ be the lattice of abstract weights, and $\Lambda_r$ the lattice generated by $\Phi$.  We have the following inclusion of lattices: $$\Lambda_r\subset X(T)\subset \Lambda$$ The fundamental group of $G$ is $\pi(G)=\Lambda/X(T)$.  We say that $G$ is simply-connected if $\pi(G)=0$ and $G$ is adjoint if $X(T)=\Lambda_r$.

I'd very much appreciate it is someone could describe how to arrive at the three lattices described above for each of these groups, to see that this claim is in fact true.  I'd also be interested in seeing the other groups of type $A$ which correspond to the intermediate lattices $X(T)$.  References are appreciated too.  Thanks!
