4523491,Argument using compactness to show continuity,"I'm reading Introduction to smooth manifolds (2nd edition) of John Lee.

4523619,Combinatorics contest math problem [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : The pebble sequence (Bulgarian solitaire) (2 answers) Closed 22 days ago . The problem is: We have $n(n+1)/2$ stones in $k$ piles. In each move we take one stone from each pile and form a new pile with these stones (if a pile has only one stone, after that stone is removed the pile vanishes). Show that regardless of the initial configuration, we always end up with n piles, having $1, 2, 3, \dots, n$ stones each. My ""Solution"":
I started by noticing that if we denote $f(x) = y$ our transformation from one configuration of stones to the other than $f(x) = x$ has only one solution $x = 1, 2, 3, \dots, n$ . Then, because for each number of stones (not necessary of the form $n(n+1)/2$ ) the number of possible configurations is finite we will always end up in a cycle that will repeat itself forever. I noticed from the Python script i wrote that for each initial number of stones regardless of the initial configuration we always end up in the same cycle and i wanted to prove it by induction thus completing the proof, with the induction base: for $p = 1$ stones we only have one cycle $1\to 1 \to 1\to \dots$ and the induction step: if $p > 1$ has more then one different cycle then p-1 has more then one different cycle too. If we don’t have a pile with only one stone for any combination in our cycle then we can just remove a stone from the pile with the maximum amount of stones for every configuration of the cycle thus giving us a cycle for $p-1$ stones. I’m stuck on the case when we have a pile with only one stone in a configuration of the cycle. Is there a simpler solution? Is there some core idea that i didn’t notice? can my proof be completed?
I would greatly appreciate any help.","['contest-math', 'induction', 'combinatorics']"

4523637,Extending a principal connection form to an associated principal bundle,"Suppose that I have a principal $G$ -bundle $\mathcal{G} \to M$ equipped with a principal connection form $\omega_\mathcal{G}: T\mathcal{G} \to \mathfrak{g}$ and a lie group homorphism $\varphi: G \to H$ . Explicitly, what is the formula for the extended principal connection form on the associated principal $H$ -bundle $\mathcal{G} \times_G H$ ?  I've tried looking in various textbooks but haven't found this discussed. This should be a linear map $T \mathcal{G} \times_{TG} TH \cong T(\mathcal{G} \times_G H)  \to \mathfrak{g}$ . My guess is that it would be obtained from the sum of the principal connection form $\omega_\mathcal{G}$ and the Maurer-Cartan form $\omega_H$ on elements in $T \mathcal{G} \times  TH$ . But I would need to show that this is a $TG$ -balanced map so that it descends to the quotient $T \mathcal{G} \times_{TG} TH$ . I can show that the Maurer-Cartan form transforms with respect to the tangent group structure as $$\omega_H((\varphi_* X) \cdot Y) = \operatorname{Ad}(h)\varphi_*\omega_G(X) + \omega_H(Y),$$ for $X \in T_g G$ and $Y \in T_h H$ But it seems more difficult to figure out how the principal connection form should behave with respect to the action of the tangent group $TG$ since we lack an explicit formula for the connection form.","['principal-bundles', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

$$ Some of My Efforts: The original problem is too difficult for me. I just want the accurate answer and do not have to require the complete analysing process. So I first tried to get the answer from WolframAlpha . But it seems to be failed to calculate the integral. Background: I was trying to calculate the average ""correlation"" value of a two-dimensional area $[0,H]\times[0,W]$ . In my task, the ""correlation"" $\rho$ is modeled as: $$
\rho(d)=e^{-\alpha d},
$$ where $d\in \mathbb{R}^+$ is the distance of two points. For a given point $(z,t)$ satisfying $0\le z\le H$ and $0\le t \le W$ , its average ""correlation"" is: $$
f(z,t)=\frac{1}{HW}\int_0^H{\int_0^W{\rho \left( \sqrt{\left( x-z \right) ^2+\left( y-t \right) ^2} \right)}dxdy}.
$$ And for the whole area, the average ""correlation"" is: $$
I=\frac{1}{HW}\int_0^H{\int_0^W{f\left( z,t \right)}dzdt}.
$$ Finally I get the formula in the original problem, resulting in a quadruple integral. Some Other Aspects of Help That You May Provide: I think that the original problem is too difficult. There may be some other operations helpful for me: I can change the modeling of $\rho$ . I model it from my observed data (see the figure below). Since when $d=0$ , there is $\rho=1$ (the value of each point is strongly correlated to itself), and $\rho$ is approximately decreasing but always positive in $[0,+\infty)$ . I guess the formula could be $\rho(d)=e^{-\alpha d}$ . Is there a better modeling? (The horizontal axis corresponds to $d$ , and the vertical axis corresponds to $\rho$ . The values of $\rho$ are more reliable when $0\le d\le 300$ , since the data sample number of $0\le d\le 300$ are sufficiently large and number of $d>300$ are relatively small.) I can change the calculation way of ""average"". Since the integration may be too difficult to calculate, I can use another way to measure the ""average"" of the area. Is there a better way? I try not to modify the original integral form, since it is easy to interpret and understand. Instead of directly calculating $I(H,W)$ , I can also change to calculate $I(H_1,W_1)-I(H_2,W_2)$ , since I care the difference of ""average correlations"" of two areas. However, the difference seems to be more difficult to calculate. Since $\rho$ is decreasing in $[0,+\infty)$ , I intuitively think that a small area will own a larger ""average correlation"", i.e. , $I(H_1,W_1)<I(H_2,W_2)$ when $H_1\times W_1 > H_2\times W_2$ . As you can see, I just have a vague and qualitative cognition of my above measuring and modeling now. So many things can be adjusted to make the problem easier. (I am now looking for them.) Could you please help me based on all the above descriptions?

I've been using standard references such as Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, Abramovitz and Stegun, Prudnikov et al. which have proven fruitful for almost all cases, except for this sum which I'm now struggling with for a closed form. Any help would be greatly appreciated! UPDATE 1: This arises in the context of finding a closed form for the series $$
\sum_{m=1}^\infty\left(J^2_{m-1}(mx)-J^2_{m+1}(mx)\right),
$$ I've already found that $$
\sum_{m=1}^\infty\left(J^2_{m-1}(mx)+J^2_{m+1}(mx)\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}},
$$ so by using this, equivalent series to find a closed form of would be $$
\sum_{m=1}^\infty J^2_{m\pm1}(mx).
$$ Thanks in advance! UPDATE 2: Another equivalent infinite series is by using the recurrence relations after completing the square on $$
\sum_{m=1}^\infty\left(J^2_{m-1}(mx)-J^2_{m+1}(mx)\right),
$$ which gives $$
\frac{4}{x}\sum_{m=1}J_m(mx)J'_m(mx).
$$ But this can be realised instead as a derivative with respect to $x$ as follows $$
\frac{2}{x}\frac{d}{dx}\sum_{m=1}\frac{J^2_m(mx)}{m}.
$$ Then, a fourth equivalent series that would answer my question would be $$
\sum_{m=1}\frac{J^2_m(mx)}{m}.
$$ This can be related to the original question by noting the relation $$
J^2_m(mx)=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}J_{2m}(2mx\cos\theta)d\theta.
$$ Fubini allows us to bring the infinite sum inside the integral and this is where the original sum involving not a squared Bessel but even order terms only. Effectively, finding a closed form to any of these series would aid me greatly! UPDATE 3 (Edited): After reading the comment below, we use the following two facts $$
J_n(a)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\pi dt\,\cos(tn-a\sin t),
$$ and $$
\sum_{n=1}\frac{\cos(nx)}{n}=-\frac{1}{2}\ln(2(1-\cos x))=-\ln(2\sin(x/2)).
$$ References can be find in either DLMF or Gradshteyn and Ryzhik. The sum reads $$
\frac{2}{x}\frac{d}{dx}\sum_{m=1}^\infty\frac{J^2_{m}(mx)}{m}=\frac{2}{x}\frac{d}{dx}\frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sum_{m=1}^\infty\frac{J_{2m}(2mx\cos\theta)}{m}d\theta.
$$ Let's define $z=x\cos\theta<1$ .
Then by the expansions, we have $$

Using the gender as a variable, we could say that $500 \times 0.55 + 500 \times 0.65 = 600$ students are expected to graduate on average Using hours of studied as a variable, we could say that $400 \times 0.8 + 600 \times 0.6 = 680$ students are expected to graduate on average But could we take the average for both of these numbers and say that $(600 + 680)/2 = 640$ students are expected to graduate on average?

Since $\gamma$ is a right-facing semicircle with radius $\epsilon$ centered at the point $z=i$ I parametarized it in the following way: $$z=\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi}{2}-t)}+i,\ t \in [0, \pi]$$ $$dz=-i\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi}{2}-t)}\ dt$$ The integrand after factorizing the denominator and is therefore $$\frac{e^{i(\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi}{2}-t)}+i)}}{(\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi }{2}-t)}+i+i)(\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi }{2}-t)}+i-i)(\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi }{2}-t)}+i+1)}(-i\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi }{2}-t)})\ dt$$ silplifying: $$(-i)\frac{e^{i(\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi }{2}-t)}+i)}}{(\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi }{2}-t)}+2i)(\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi }{2}-t)}+i+1)}\ dt$$ making the integral over $\gamma$ equal to $$-i\int_{0}^{\pi }\frac{e^{i(\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi }{2}-t)}+i)}}{(\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi }{2}-t)}+2i)(\epsilon e^{i(\frac{\pi }{2}-t)}+i+1)} \ dt$$ in the limit as $\epsilon$ goes to $0$ , the integral approaches $$-i\int_{0}^{\pi } \frac{e^{-1}}{1+3i}\ dt = \frac{-\pi}{e}\left (\frac{3+i}{10}  \right )$$ However I am unsure how to evaluate the integrals over $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ , if you can combine them into one integral when $\epsilon$ approaches zero since it would integrate over all numbers from $i$ R to $0$ except for $z=i$ or if there's some obscure theorem or something I don't know about, otherwise I don't know if there's anything I can do except integrate it non-elementary which defeats the entire purpouse of contour integrating in the first place.","['integration', 'improper-integrals', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration', 'complex-integration']"

4525127,Formulate constraints such that the intersection area of 4 half planes (formed by 4 lines) is an enclosed convex quadrilateral containing origin,"Background: There are four lines $A_ix + B_iy + C_i = 0 (A_i^2+B_i^2 \ne 0), i=1,...,4$ , not passing through origin $(0,0)$ , which means $C_i \ne 0, i = 1,...,4$ . Without loss of generality, we assume $A_ix + B_iy + C_i | _{(0,0)} < 0,  i=1,...,4$ , namely $C_i < 0, i=1,...,4$ . Thus, divided by $-C_i > 0$ on both sides of the line equation, we reduce the original line equation to $a_ix + b_iy - 1 = 0 (a_i^2+b_i^2 \ne 0), i=1,...,4$ where $a_i = A_i/(-C_i)$ and $b_i = B_i/(-C_i)$ . We will use the reduced equation in this problem, and for convenience I formally write it as a theorem below: Theorem: Any line not passing through the origin can be represented as $a_ix + b_iy - 1 = 0 (a_i^2+b_i^2 \ne 0)$ (namely, the set of all lines not passing through the origin = $\{ax+by-1=0: a,b \in \mathbb{R} \wedge a^2+b^2 \ne 0\}$ = $\{ax+by+c = 0: a,b,c \in \mathbb{R} \wedge a^2+b^2 \ne 0 \wedge c \ne 0\}$ ); Also, a line always cuts the whole plane into two half planes, and this representation ensures that any point in the same half plane as the origin $(0,0)$ always makes $a_ix + b_iy - 1 < 0$ . We define the half plane of a line where the origin locates as the inner side, and the other half plane as the outer side of the line. Problem: which constraints (on coefficients $a_i,b_i$ ) of the lines need to be formulated to guarantee that the area $S : = \{(x,y): \bigwedge a_ix + b_iy - 1 < 0(a_i^2+b_i^2 \ne 0), i = 1,...,4\}$ is a closed convex (the definition of $S$ guarantees if $S$ enclosed then it is convex) quadrilateral? (Of course, the origin is definitely inside $S$ , by definition of $S$ .)

4525291,"Spivak: what precisely is ""bounds on the error"" in Taylor theorem?","The following problem is from Chapter 20 of Spivak's Calculus (a) In Problem 11-41 you showed that the equation $x^2=\cos{x}$ has precisely two solutions. Use the third degree Taylor polynomial of $\cos$ to show that the solutions are approximately $\pm \sqrt{2/3}$ ,
and find bounds on the error. Then use the fifth degree Taylor
polynomial to get a better approximation. What precisely does ""bounds on the error"" mean here? Consider first the third degree Taylor polynomial and the use of Taylor's theorem $$\cos{x}=P_{3,0}(x)+R_{3,0}(x)\tag{1}$$ where $P_{3,0}$ is the third degree Taylor Polynomial at $0$ . Then $$P_{3,0}(x)=1-\frac{x^2}{2}$$ $$R_{3,0}(x)=\frac{\cos{t}}{4!}x^4, t\in (0,x)$$ $$\implies |R_{3,0}(x)|\leq \frac{x^4}{4!}$$ If we equate the polynomial $P_{3,0}(x)$ to $x^2$ we obtain $x=\pm\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}$ . At these particular values of $x$ , we know that the remainder is less than $\frac{1}{54}$ . What this means is that the value of $\cos{\left (\pm\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\right )}$ is within $\frac{1}{54}$ of $\frac{2}{3}$ . However, this does not tell us much about how far off we are from the actual $x$ at which $\cos{(x)}=x^2$ . Note that the problem statement makes reference to a previous problem 11-41. In that problem we showed that the two solutions to $x^2=\cos{x}$ are such that $|x|<1$ . Thus $R_{3,0}(x)<\frac{1}{4!}$ . If we equate $(1)$ to $x^2$ , however, and use $R(x)$ to denote $R_{3,0}(x)$ we obtain $$1-\frac{x^2}{2}+R(x)=x^2$$ $$|3x^2-2|\leq 2|R(x)|\leq 2\frac{x^4}{4!}\leq \frac{1}{12}$$ $$\implies \frac{\sqrt{23}}{6}\leq |x|\leq \frac{5}{6}$$ So, based on bounds on the remainder, we were able to determine bounds on $x$ . My questions are what is the ""bounds on the error"" in this case with a third degree Taylor polynomial? in general, how do we know that the value of $x$ we found by equating the Taylor polynomial to $x^2$ is within the intervals we found wherein $f(x)=x^2$ ?

 \limits_{\substack{A,B\subset \mathbb{Z}  \\ |A|=|B|=k}}\frac{|S\cap
 (A\times B)|}{|A||B|}.$$ Show that $\lim \limits_{k\to \infty} d_k(S)$ exists and is always either 0 or 1. This is the original version of the problem but I think it is more correctly to replace $\max$ with $\sup$ , i.e. $$d_k(S)=\sup
 \limits_{\substack{A,B\subset \mathbb{Z}  \\ |A|=|B|=k}}\frac{|S\cap
 (A\times B)|}{|A||B|}.$$ I have no idea how to attack this problem but after some thoughts I was able to solve the problem in particular case, when $S\subset\mathbb{Z}^2$ is a bounded set. More precisely, if $S\subset [-N,N]^2$ for some $N\in \mathbb{N}$ , then $d_k(S)=\dfrac{|S|}{k^2}$ for $k\geq 4N$ . Therefore, $\lim \limits_{k\to \infty} d_k(S)=0$ .

4525454,Calculate $\frac{4-5\sin\alpha}{2+3\cos\alpha}$,"Calculate $$\dfrac{4-5\sin\alpha}{2+3\cos\alpha}$$ if $\cot\dfrac{\alpha}{2}=-\dfrac32$ . My first approach was to somehow write the given expression only in terms of the given $\cot\frac{\alpha}{2}$ and just put in the value $\left(-\dfrac{3}{2}\right)$ . Now I don't think that's possible because we have constants (4 and 2). My try, though: $$\dfrac{4-5\sin\alpha}{2+3\cos\alpha}=\dfrac{4-5.2\sin\frac{\alpha}{2}\cos\frac{\alpha}{2}}{2+3\left(\cos^2\frac{\alpha}{2}-\sin^2\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)}=\dfrac{4-10\sin\frac{\alpha}{2}\cos\frac{\alpha}{2}}{2+3\cos^2\frac{\alpha}{2}-3\sin^2\frac{\alpha}{2}}$$ My second idea was to find the value of the trig functions of $\alpha$ . I don't know if this is the most straight-forward approach, but $$\cot\alpha=\dfrac{\cot^2\frac{\alpha}{2}-1}{2\cot\frac{\alpha}{2}}=\dfrac{\frac94-1}{-2.\frac32}=-\dfrac{5}{12}.$$ Am I now supposed just to find the values of $\sin\alpha$ and $\cos\alpha$ ? Nothing more elegant? We would have $\dfrac{\cos\alpha}{\sin\alpha}=-\dfrac{5}{12}\Rightarrow\cos\alpha=-\dfrac{5}{12}\sin\alpha$ and putting into $\sin^2\alpha+\cos^2\alpha=1$ we'd get $\cos\alpha=\pm\dfrac{12}{13}$ .",['trigonometry']
4525468,Is the cut-locus of $p$ homotoy equivalent to $M\setminus \{ p\}$?,"Suppose $p$ is a point in a connected and compact Riemannian manifold $M$ . Does it hold that the cut locus $\text{Cut}(p)$ is homotopy equivalent to $M \setminus \{p \}$ ?
I can show that every point in $M$ is either in a normal neighborhood of $p$ or else it is contained in its cut locus. From here my first candidate for a homotopy would be to take $v = \exp_p ^{-1}(q)$ , find its cut time $t(p, v/|v|)$ and then send $q$ to $\exp_p(t(p, v/|v|) v/|v|)$ . This is certainly continuous and maps the part of $M$ diffeomorphic to a neighborhood of $0 \in T_pM$ to $\text{Cut}(p)$ . To extend this function to the cut-locus, however, I am having more trouble because I don't know what the behavior of $\exp_p ^{-1}$ is as we approach a cut point. Furthermore, I still have to find the map from the cut locus to $M$ which can be deformed into the identity. What confuses me here is that the cut locus may consist of a single point, so that essentially any constant map is homotopic to the identity. This feels like I am either missing something or the homotopy equivalence condition is fairly weak. Maybe I am going on the totally wrong path. Is the claim even true?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
4525540,Why this test statistics for these distributions,"For a random sample $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ from the Poisson distribution I get where the T-statistic comes from because for a Poisson $E(X) = \lambda$ and $V(X)=\lambda$ so it becomes: $$T= \frac{\bar{X}-E(X)}{\sqrt{\frac{V(X)}{n}}} =\frac{\bar{X}-\lambda}{\sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{n}}},$$ where $\bar{X} = (X_1+\ldots,X_n)/n$ . But for the geometric distribution I have $E(X) = \frac{1}{p}$ and $V(X) = \frac{1}{p^2}$ . And if I substitute: $$T = \frac{\bar{X}-E(X)}{\sqrt{\frac{V(X)}{n}}} = \frac{\bar{X}-\frac{1}{p}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{np^2}}} \neq \frac{\bar{X}-\frac{1}{p}}{\sqrt{\frac{1-p}{np^2}}}$$ The expression on the right is the real expression.

For $z < x$ , I want to compute the probability that $\{X_t\}$ does NOT down-cross $z$ . Intuitively, this probability is positive, because the process has a positive drift. At least, I'd like to show formally that this probability is indeed positive. I have no idea how to start. Resources I can find online or in textbooks deal with random walks on lattices, not on continuums. Since I cannot write a recursive equation for each state as in the countable state space case, I think I need to take a different approach from the case where $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ .","['stochastic-processes', 'random-walk', 'probability']"
4525593,Converting SDE to ODE via Dynkin's formula,"I'm reading on Dynkin's formula.

So far so good. But then I came into this A celebration of Dynkin’s formula slides of Prof. Tommi Sottinen . It gives an application of Dynkin's formula, which got me totally lost -- Consider the 2nd order ordinary differential equations (ODE) on $u(x)$ : $$\mu(x)u'(x)+\frac12 \sigma^2(x) u''(x) = 0, \qquad x\in
(a,b)\subset \mathbb R$$ with boundary conditions $u(a)$ and $u(b)$ .
Let $X$ be the Ito diffusion $$dX=\mu(X) dt+\sigma(X) dW$$ It follows
from the Dynkin's formula that $$u(x)=\mathbb E^x u(X(\tau))$$ , where $\tau$ is the first exit time of $X$ from the interval $(a,b)$ . I really couldn't understand this SDE->ODE convertion. Why does it work? So far my trying to understand it is -- The ODE $\mu(x)u'(x)+\frac12 \sigma^2(x) u''(x) = 0$ is just $$\mathscr Lu(x)=0$$ Substitue with $u(x)=\mathbb E^x u(X(\tau))$ we get $$\mathscr L \mathbb E^x u(X(t)) = 0$$ , which is equivalent to $$\mathbb E^x \mathscr L u(X(t)) = 0$$ , which means $\mathscr Lu(X(t))$ is a martingale.

Below are some observations about the question. Observation 1: The right hand side of (1) is known as (an example of a) Lambert series . For $q=1/2$ it is equal to Erdős–Borwein constant ( A065442 ). Observation 2. Numerical evidence: According to numerical evaluation lhs and rhs of (1) match up to $10^{-16}$ . According to Wolfram Mathematica lhs and rhs of (2) match (as series in $q$ ) modulo $q^{1001}$ . Observation 3. Equivalent statements: The following statements are equivalent (thus, you can prove any one of these to answer the question). Equation (1) is true for all $q\in\mathbb{C}$ s.t. $\left|q\right| < 1$ . Equation (1) is true as a formal series in $q$ . For a positive integer $n$ denote by $d(n)$ the number of divisors of $n$ ( $d$ is known by the name of the divisor function ).

Consider a black box $B$ , which when queried returns a random vector $v\in V$ (with equal probabilities). Consider the following 2-stage process. Stage 1: ""Span"". In this stage we query $B$ for vectors $v_1,\dots,v_k$ until $\text{span}\{v_1,\dots,v_k\} = V$ . Stage 2: ""Linear dependence"". In this stage we query $B$ for vectors $v_1,\dots,v_k$ until they are linearly dependent. That is,
until there are numbers $n_1,\dots,n_k \in \mathbb{F}_p$ s.t. $\sum_{i=1}^k n_i v_i = 0$ and at least one of $n_i$ is non-zero. It can be proven that this process (the total of 2 stages) takes on average $2n+1+C_{p}+O(np^{-n})$ queries to the black box. The claim is that for infinitely many $p$ we have $C_p = 0$ . For any integer $p$ equal to an integer power of a prime we have $C_p = 0$ . Observation 4. Relationship to the Simon's problem: The process described in #4 of observation 3 above is related to the Simon's problem for $n+1$ qubits. For $p=2$ the number of queries in stage 1 is equal to the number of queries to the oracle needed by the quantum algorithm, while the number of queries in stage 2 is equal to the number of queries needed by the best classical algorithm for linear oracles (where there is no quantum advantage).","['integer-partitions', 'vector-spaces', 'combinatorics', 'generating-functions', 'sequences-and-series']"

4525835,Naive Line Bundle Functor isn't a Zariski Sheaf,"I'm reading a set of notes on algebraic stacks by Anatoly Preygel, and in the opening paragraphs it says Meanwhile moduli problems ... often have the property that the functor $$T \mapsto \{ \text{isomorphism classes of ... over $T$} \}$$ is not only not a scheme but not even a sheaf. Indeed taking ... to be ""line bundles"" shows that it is not even a Zariski sheaf: The stalks of the presheaf are all trivial, but there can exist non-trivial sections. I think I know what this means, but I'm relying on two guesses (which I'm charitably calling ""intuition"" in my attempt below). If someone could please verify them, and provide any other insight you think might be valuable, I would really appreciate it! Write $\mathsf{Aff}$ for the opposite of the category of finitely presented rings. Let's call this functor $\mathcal{L} : \mathsf{Aff}^\text{op} \to \mathsf{Set}$ , so it's a presheaf on $\mathsf{Aff}$ . We want to show that it's not a sheaf for the (big) Zariski topology. We'll do that by showing that each stalk is trivial there are nontrivial sections After all, if each stalk is trivial, then by uniqueness of gluing for sheaves, we should only get trivial sections. So if (1) and (2) are both satisfied, we'll show that $\mathcal{L}$ isn't a sheaf. Let's start with (2), which is easier. A section of $\mathcal{L}$ is just $\mathcal{L}(\text{Spec} S)$ for your favorite (finitely presented) ring $S$ . Of course, there are plenty of rings admitting nontrivial line bundles (said another way, there are plenty of rings $S$ with nontrivial picard group) so that nontrivial sections of $\mathcal{L}$ are abundant. Next up is (1). According to this MO question, points of $\mathcal{E} = \mathsf{Sh}(\mathsf{Aff}, \text{Zar})$ are local rings $R$ . Indeed, the inverse image part of the point (read: geometric morphism) $\mathsf{Set} \to \mathcal{E}$ will be given by $R^* : \mathcal{E} \to \mathsf{Set}$ , the kan extension of $\text{Hom}(\text{Spec}(R),-) : \mathsf{Aff} \to \mathsf{Set}$ along the (yoneda) embedding $y : \mathsf{Aff} \to \mathcal{E}$ . The good news is that we only need to understand $R^*$ , since the stalk of $\mathcal{L}$ at $R$ is exactly $R^* \mathcal{L}$ . The bad news is that I'm inexperienced with making these calculations... Intuition says that $R$ is a colimit of its finitely presented subrings, each of which is an object of $\mathsf{Aff}$ . So each finitely presented subring is like an ""open set containing $R$ "", and we should be able to compute the stalk of $\mathcal{L}$ at $R$ as $\text{colim } \mathcal{L}(\text{Spec} R_i)$ , where the $R_i$ are the finitely presented subrings of $R$ ... Much weaker intuition says that this should be the same thing as invertible sheaves on $R$ . This gives the expected answer since we know the picard group for local rings is trivial (remember $R$ was local). So indeed, if the above is correct, each stalk is trivial, showing (1), and we're done.

4526053,Finding the range of a Quadratic divided by a Quadratic,"I need to find the range of a function: $$f(x) = \frac{e^{2x} - e^x + 1}{e^{2x} + 3e^x - 7} $$ Substituting $e^x = t $ and equating $f(x)$ to $y$ , I get $$(y-1)t^2 + (3y+1)t - (7y+1) = 0$$ Since $t$ must be real and positive, I get the range of y to be $(-\infty, -\frac{1}{3})\bigcup(1, \infty) $ . Is this correct?","['functions', 'quadratics']"
4526076,A mistake in Bourbaki's construction of general tensor product?,"Fortunately someone seems to have a asked a similar question before here: Bourbaki's construction of generalized tensor product of modules ; to save space and time, I will use the same notation and terminology. I will begin where the other question ended. After defining $\bigotimes^{(c,p,q)}_{\lambda\in L}G_\lambda$ , Bourbaki writes the following: Then we are given details of the associativity properties: The existence of the claimed isomorphism is then proved by induction on $n$ . The proof of the base case is easy. However, I have found that ""permutability hypothesis (P)"" is not enough to allow the proof in the induction step. To highlight this, I will try to show that the case $n=3$ doesn't reduce to a routine application of the result for $n=2$ . So, let all notation be as before and let $n=3$ . That is to say, let $(L_1,L_2,L_3)$ be a partition of $L$ . Then $(L_1\cup L_2,L_3)$ is also a partition of $L$ and we should be able to apply the result for $n=2$ , right? But this is not possible! What do we need to apply $n=2$ result? We need the following: A family $(G_\lambda)_{\lambda\in L}$ of abelian groups; A mapping $c:\Omega\rightarrow L\times L$ ; Two mappings $p\in\prod_{\omega\in\Omega}\text{End}_{\mathbb{Z}}(E_{\rho(\omega)})$ and $q\in\prod_{\omega\in\Omega}\text{End}_{\mathbb{Z}}(E_{\sigma(\omega)})$ satisfying a corresponding form of hypothesis (P). The problem is that (3) is not satisfied. By assumption, we are given a map $c:\Omega\rightarrow L\times L$ and the two mapping $p,q$ . Then we have $$\Omega_1=c^{-1}(L_1\times L_1)\cup c^{-1}(L_1\times L_2)\cup c^{-1}(L_2\times L_1)\cup c^{-1}(L_2\times L_2)\text{ and }\Omega_2=c^{-1}(L_3\times L_3).$$ Now, let us see whether the corresponding hypothesis (P) holds for this partition and mappings. Fix $\omega\in\Omega-(\Omega_1\cup\Omega_2)$ , say, $\omega\in c^{-1}(L_1\times L_3)$ . Let $\xi\in\Omega_1\cup\Omega_2$ , say, $\xi\in c^{-1}(L_1\times L_2)$ . We need, for example, for $$p_\omega\circ p_\xi=p_\xi\circ p_\omega$$ to hold, but we have no reason to deduce that it does. By assumption we only have the above identity for $\xi\in c^{-1}(L_i\times L_i)\cap\rho^{-1}(\{\rho(\omega)\})$ for $i=1,2,3$ for a fixed $\omega$ not in sets of the form $c^{-1}(L_i\times L_i)$ . The same problem exists for the other identities. So, it's clear that hypothesis (P) in the form given by Bourbaki is not enough. Am I correct? Does anyone know how to fix it?

4526121,I'm having trouble computing a double integral in a probability question.,"The Question: Two points are chosen randomly and independently on two adjacent sides of a square, connecting them splits the square into two parts, one of which is a right-angled triangle. What is the probability the resulting triangle's area will be less than $\tfrac16$ th the area of the square? My Attempted Solution I started by defining k as the length of the side of the x And I decided the sides will be on the x and y axis respectively. $$X = \text{The first point's x value} \quad X \sim \mathrm{U}_{[0,k]}$$ $$Y = \text{The second point's y value} \quad Y \sim \mathrm{U}_{[0,k]}$$ since they're independent their shared pdf is $$f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{1}{k^2}$$ So solving then becomes: $$P\left(0.5XY<\frac{k^2}{6}\right) = \iint_{xy< \frac{k^2}{3} } f_{X,Y}(x,y) dxdy $$ this is the point where I'm getting confused, my current attempt is to then do $$\int_{\frac{k}{3}}^{k} \int_{\frac{k}{3}}^{\frac{k^2}{3x}} \frac{1}{k^2} dy dx = \frac{\ln(3)}{3} -\frac{2}{9}$$ Based on a drawing of the region I'm integrating, but what I'm getting is not the right answer.
I'd love to get help with whether my approach is okay, and where did I go wrong","['multivariable-calculus', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"
4526140,Bounding the expectation of a product of random variables using Hölder's inequality,"Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k$ be centered random variables which are not necessarily independent.  Under what conditions do we have a bound of the form $$\mathbb{E} \left\lvert X_1 X_2 \cdots X_k \right\rvert \leq C \sqrt{(\mathbb{E} X_1^2)(\mathbb{E} X_2^2) \cdots (\mathbb{E} X_k^2)}$$ for some constant $C > 0$ ? When $k \leq 2$ , this follows from Hölder's inequality: $$\mathbb{E} \left\lvert X_1 X_2 \right\rvert \leq \sqrt{(\mathbb{E} X_1^2) (\mathbb{E} X_2^2)}.$$ However, for general $k$ , Hölder only gives $$\mathbb{E} \left\lvert X_1 X_2 \cdots X_k \right\rvert \leq \sqrt[k]{(\mathbb{E} X_1^k) (\mathbb{E} X_2^k) \cdots (\mathbb{E} X_k^k)},$$ and in general we do not have $\sqrt[k]{\mathbb{E} X_i^k} \leq \sqrt{\mathbb{E} X_i^2}$ . This also holds if $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k$ are independent.  In that case, we have $$\mathbb{E} \left\lvert X_1 X_2 \cdots X_k \right\rvert = (\mathbb{E} \left\lvert X_1 \right\rvert) (\mathbb{E} \left\lvert X_2 \right\rvert) \cdots (\mathbb{E} \left\lvert X_k \right\rvert) \leq \sqrt{\mathbb{E} X_1^2} \sqrt{\mathbb{E} X_2^2} \cdots \sqrt{\mathbb{E} X_k^2}$$ But it cannot hold in general. Suppose $X_1 = X_2 = \cdots = X_k = X$ .  Then this inequality says $\mathbb{E} \left\lvert X^k \right\rvert \leq C (\mathbb{E} X^2)^{k/2}$ , which would imply that if a random variable $X$ has finite second moments, then it has moments of all orders.  This is false: consider a real-valued random variable with probability density function proportional to $\frac{1}{1+x^4}$ , for instance. The random variable $X$ in the counterexample in the previous bullet point is unbounded.  What if we assumed that $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k$ were bounded? Motivation I'm trying to follow an argument in Bryc, Dembo, and Jiang, ""Spectral measure of large random Hankel, Markov and Toeplitz matrices."" Near the end of their proof of Proposition 4.12 (page 30 of the arXiv version), they have $$f_n(w) = \sum_{i=1}^q \mathbb{E}\left[ L_w (Q_{a_i} - \tilde{Q}_{a_i}) \prod_{j=1}^{i-1} M_{a_j, a_j} \prod_{j=i+1}^q \tilde{M}_{a_j, a_j} \right],$$ and they write ""since the distribution of $(L_w, \{Q_i\}, \{\tilde{Q}_i\})$ is independent of $n > 2k$ , while $M_{ii}$ and $\tilde{M}_{ii}$ are normal of mean zero and variance at most $n + 2$ , it follows by Hölder's inequality that $\left\vert f_n(w) \right\rvert \leq C_w n^{(q(w) - 1) / 2}$ ..."" My real question is how this conclusion can be obtained.  I can see that based on the information provided, the outer summation and the terms with $L_w$ , $Q_i$ , or $\tilde{Q}_i$ do not depend on $n$ and can be absorbed into the constant $C_w$ .  So it remains to study $\mathbb{E}(\prod_{j=1}^{i-1} M_{a_j, a_j} \prod_{j=i+1}^q \tilde{M}_{a_j, a_j})$ , which is the expectation of a product of $q-1$ factors. If the inequality at the top of this post holds, then we would have $$\mathbb{E}(\prod_{j=1}^{i-1} M_{a_j, a_j} \prod_{j=i+1}^q \tilde{M}_{a_j, a_j}) \leq \sqrt{\prod_{j=1}^{i-1} \mathbb{E} M_{a_j, a_j}^2 \prod_{j=i+1}^q \mathbb{E}\tilde{M}_{a_j, a_j}^2}.$$ Using $\mathbb{E}M_{a_j, a_j}^2 = O(n)$ and $\mathbb{E}\tilde{M}_{a_j, a_j}^2 = O(n)$ , we deduce that the whole expression is $O(n^{(q-1)/2})$ , as claimed.  However, I'm not seeing the Hölder's inequality argument that would establish the last inequality.","['expected-value', 'holder-inequality', 'probability-theory']"
