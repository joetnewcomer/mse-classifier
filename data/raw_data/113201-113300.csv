1646308,Find the inverse of the following piecewise defined function,"Find the inverse of $f$ if $f(x)=$
$$
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{2-x}, &\text{for $x<0$}\\ 
1-x^2, &\text{for $x \ge 0$} \\ 
\end{cases}
$$ My effort For  $y=\sqrt{2-x}$ ,we find 
\begin{array}{c}
y=\sqrt{2-x} \\
y^2=2-x  &\text{(I can do this since $\sqrt{2-x}>0$ ,for $x<0$)} \\
x=2-y^2
\end{array} So for this piece of function we have $f^{-1}(x)=2-x^2$ for $x>\sqrt{2}$ since this the range of $f(x)=\sqrt{2-x}$ for $x<0$. Now, for the second part of the function we have 
\begin{array}{c}
y=1-x^2 \\
x^2=1-y \\
x=\sqrt{1-y} ,&\text{since $x\ge 0 $}
\end{array} So for this latter part we have $f^{-1}(x)=\sqrt{1-x}$ which has domain $(-\inf,1]$ . so our piecewise defined function for $f^{-1}$ is
\begin{array}{c}
2-x^2 , &\text{for $x> \sqrt{2} $} \\
\sqrt{1-x}, &\text{ for $x\le1$} \\

1646312,An inequality on the rank of a block matrix,"Let $\mathbb F$ be a field, and let $r_1, r_2, s_1, s_2$ be positive integers. Consider the matrix
$$X:=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
 A & B \\

 \right],$$
where $A \in \mathbb F^{r_1 \times s_1}$, $B\in \mathbb F^{r_1\times s_2}$, $C \in \mathbb F^{r_2\times s_1}$ and $D \in \mathbb F^{r_2\times s_2}$. Q1: Is the following inequality true? 
  $$rank [X] \geq rank \left[\begin{array}{c}
 B \\
 D  \end{array}
 \right]+\max \left\{rank[A\;\; B]- rank[B], rank[C\;\;D]-rank[D] \right\}$$
 If so, when does the equality hold? Q2: Is there some nice formula for $rank[X]$ depending only on the blocks? Thanks.
Alessandro Edit: The answer to the first question is YES. Is there an elementary proof of it? I can prove it using using results on completions of partial matrices, but I believe there should be an easy way to prove it. For the equality I suspect that it holds if and only if
$$rank \left[\begin{array}{c}
 A \\
 C  \end{array}
 \right]=\max \left\{rank[A],rank[C] \right\},$$
but I'm not sure.","['finite-fields', 'inequality', 'matrices', 'matrix-rank', 'linear-algebra']"
1646314,Convergence of Riemann sums of a periodic function,"Short version for people who don't like reading: Let $f\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be $1$-periodic, measurable and bounded.  Is it true that, for almost all $x$, the average of $f(x)$, $f(x+\frac{1}{n})$, $f(x+\frac{2}{n})$, …, $f(x-\frac{1}{n})$ tends to $\int_0^1 f$ when $n\to+\infty$? And now for a more detailed version of the question: Let $\mathbb{T} := \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ so that functions $\mathbb{T}\to\mathbb{R}$ can be identified with $1$-periodic functions $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$. If $f\colon\mathbb{T}\to\mathbb{R}$, we define $\mathscr{M}_n(f)\colon\mathbb{T}\to\mathbb{R}$ by
$$(\mathscr{M}_n(f))(x) := \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f\Big(\!x+\frac{k}{n}\Big)$$
the $n$-th “Riemann sum” of $f$, i.e., the average of the $n$ translates of $f$ by $n$-th periods.  If also $f \in L^1(\mathbb{T})$ we define $\mathscr{E}(f)\colon\mathbb{T}\to\mathbb{R}$ by
$$(\mathscr{E}(f))(x) := \int_{\mathbb{T}} f(t)\,dt$$
(constant function!) the integral, i.e., overall average of $f$. The general problem is in what ways and under what assumptions we can say that $\mathscr{M}_n(f) \to \mathscr{E}(f)$. Precise questions are below (at end), but first let me first state a few simple known facts relevant to this situation, that might help provide some background: If $f$ is a step function (where ""step function"" means a linear combination of characteristic functions of intervals) then $|\mathscr{M}_n(f) - \mathscr{E}(f)| \leq \frac{\|f\|_\infty}{n}$ everywhere.  (Sketch of proof: if $f = \mathbf{1}_{[0,r/n)}$ with $r\in\mathbb{N}$ then in fact $\mathscr{M}_n(f) = \mathscr{E}(f)$, and if 
$f_c = \mathbf{1}_{[0,c)}$ with $\frac{r}{n}\leq c<\frac{r+1}{n}$ then $f_{r/n} \leq f_c \leq f_{(r+1)/n}$ everywhere so that the same inequality holds after applying $\mathscr{M}_n$, i.e., $\frac{r}{n} \leq \mathscr{M}_n(f_c) \leq \frac{r+1}{n}$, whence the conclusion for $f_c$, and then for a general step function by translating and taking linear combinations.) If $f \in L^p(\mathbb{T})$ with $1\leq p<\infty$ then $\mathscr{M}_n(f) \to \mathscr{E}(f)$ in $L^p(\mathbb{T})$.  (Follows from the above by density of step functions in $L^p$ and the fact that $\mathscr{M}_n$ and $\mathscr{E}$ have norm $1$.) If $f$ is Riemann-integrable then $\mathscr{M}_n(f) \to \mathscr{E}(f)$ uniformly on $\mathbb{T}$.  (Fairly obvious using the first point and the following definition of R-integrable functions: for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exist $h$ and $\varphi$ step functions such that $|f-h|\leq\varphi$ everywhere and $\int\varphi \leq \varepsilon$.) If $u_n = n\mathbf{1}_{[0,1/n)}$ then $\mathscr{M}_n(f) - \mathscr{E}(f) = \mathscr{M}_n(f - (f*u_n))$ (writing $*$ for convolution), and when $f$ is measurable we have $f*u_n \to f$ almost everywhere (by the existence of right Lebesgue points). The Fourier coefficients of $\mathscr{M}_n(f)$ are those of $f$ at indices multiple of $n$, the other being $0$; so they converge punctually (i.e., for a given idnex) to those of $\mathscr{E}(f)$.  Also, if the Fourier coefficients of $f$ are $\ell^q$ then the convergence of Fourier coefficients of $\mathscr{M}_n(f)$ to those of $\mathscr{E}(f)$ holds in $\ell^q$. Update 2016-02-10: If $f$ is $L^1(\mathbb{T})$, it is not necessarily the case that $\mathscr{M}_n(f) \to \mathscr{E}(f)$ almost everywhere, or indeed, anywhere : this is a theorem of Marcinkiewicz and Zygmund ("" Mean values of trigonometrical polynomials "", Fund. Math. 28 (1937), chapter II, theorem 3 on p. 157).  Their counterexample (which is $(-\log|x|)/\sqrt{|x|}$ on $[0,\frac{1}{2}]$) is certainly not bounded, however. Birkhoff's ergodic theorem is probably also worth mentioning here: if $\xi$ is irrational, then for all $f\in L^1(\mathbb{T})$, for almost all $x$ we have $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} f(x+k\xi) \to \mathscr{E}(f)$. Now at last here are my questions , motivated by the gaps left in the above facts: If $f \in L^\infty(\mathbb{T})$, do we have $\mathscr{M}_n(f) \to \mathscr{E}(f)$ in $L^\infty(\mathbb{T})$?  If not, do we have $\mathscr{M}_n(f) \to \mathscr{E}(f)$ in $L^\infty(\mathbb{T})$ almost everywhere?

1646503,Ehrenfest Chain: stationary distribution,"In the Ehrenfest Chain model: There are M balls which are divided between urn A and urn B.

It turns out that the stationary distribution is $\pi_j=$$M\choose j$$2^{-M}$. The textbook claims this is quit intuitive. I don't understand what is ""by symmetry, it is equally likely to be in either urn"". This, however, is quite intuitive, for if we focus on any one ball, it
  becomes quite clear that its position will be independent of the
  positions of the other balls (since no matter where the other M − 1
  balls are, the ball under consideration at each stage will be moved
  with probability 1/M) and by symmetry, it is equally likely to be in

Notation: Here $C^2$ $(C^1)$ means twice (once) continuously differentiable. Possible approach: Lets start with trying to show that $A$ is continuous. If we can show that

I understand that the quasi-coherent property is local, since it can be checked on an affine cover by definition, so for proving that the pullback of a quasi-coherent sheaf is quasi-coherent, one can assume $X$ to be affine.

1646675,Find all $n$ such that $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$ is prime,"I'll try to format my question in a manner such that you can skip (irrelevant) parts. Exercise: Find all natural $n$ such that $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$ is prime. Motivation: I'm trying to prepare talented elementary school children for mathematics competition and the question from the title popped up somewhere as suggested for the purpose (explicitly stating this should be number theory exercise for elementary school). Now, this immediately rang some alarms, as powers are learned in grade 8 (final grade before high school), when they certainly don't know any modular arithmetic or induction, let alone more advanced number theory. I tried to solve it anyway to see if this could actually be used, but to my surprise, I couldn't. Obviously, when $n=1$ we get $17$, which is prime, but for $n>1$ it seems that it will never be prime again, although I fail to show it (computer says that the expression is never prime in range $n\in[2, 100000000]$). There is, of course, possibility of a typo in question, but computer check up makes me believe that this is ""legit"" question. My work: First of all, for $n=1$ we have $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n = 17$ which is prime. Secondly, it is easy enough to check that for $n = 2k,\ k\in\mathbb N$ we have $5\mid 3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$. This looked promising, but for $n = 5$, we get $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n = 211\cdot 857$ as prime decomposition which is definitely worrisome. I tried to find some appropriate $d\in\mathbb N$ such that $n = qd + r$ to build some casework with respect to $r$, but had no luck. What I did notice is that if you pick $n$ in some non-trivial ideal $(d)$, there is at least one prime $p_d$ such that $p_d\mid 3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$, for all $n\in (d)$. (though, I proved this only for $d=2$, for $d>2$ this is but a computer inspired conjecture) Here is a table: \begin{array}{c | c}
d & p_d \\ \hline
2 & 5 \\
3 & 19 \\
4 & 5, 13 \\
5 & 211 \\
6 & 5, 7, 19 \\
7 & 29, 71 \\
8 & 5, 13, 97 \\
9 & 19, 1009 \\
10 & 5, 11, 211\\
\end{array} Another attempt was obviously to try to factor $3^{2n+1}-4^{n+1}+6^n$ directly. Some obvious attempts led me to believe this approach might fail too. Indeed, polynomials $$x^{2n+1} - y^{2n+2} + x^ny^n,$$ $$x^{2n+1} - (x-1)^{2n+2} + x^n(x-1)^n$$ and $$x^{2n+1} - (x+1)^{n+1} + x^n(x-1)^n$$ are irreducible over $\mathbb Q$.

Recall that the Ellentuck topology is a topology on $X$ generated by sets of the form $\{A\text{ infinite} \mid s\text{ is an initial segment of }A\text{ and }A\setminus s\subset B\}$ for some finite $s\subset \mathbb{N}$ and (infinite) $B\subset \mathbb{N}$.

Because $Y$ is a closed subset of $X$, $Y$ is normal as well. On the one hand, since $Y$ is separable, the set of continuous function on $Y$, denoted by $C(Y)$, is of cardinality $\le 2^{\aleph_0}$. On the other hand, by the Tietze extension theorem, every (continuous) function on $Z$ can be extended to a continuous function on $Y$, and so $C(Y)$ is of cardinality at least $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$.

1646912,Which derivatives are eventually periodic?,"Which derivatives are eventually periodic? I have noticed that is $a_{n}=f^{(n)}(x)$, the sequence $a_{n}$ becomes eventually periodic for a multitude of $f(x)$. If $f(x)$ was a polynomial, and $\operatorname{deg}(f(x))=n$, note that $f^{(n)}(x)=C$ if $C$ is a constant. This implies that  $f^{(n+i)}(x)=0$ for every $i$ which is a natural number. If $f(x)=e^x$, note that $f(x)=f'(x)$. This implies that $f^{(n)}(x)=e^x$ for every natural number $n$. If $f(x)=\sin(x)$, note that $f'(x)=\cos(x), f''(x)=-\sin(x), f'''(x)=-\cos(x), f''''(x)=\sin(x)$. This implies that $f^{(4n)}(x)=f(x)$ for every natural number $n$. In a similar way, if $f(x)=\cos(x)$, $f^{(4n)}(x)=f(x)$ for every natural number $n$. These appear to be the only functions whose derivatives become eventually periodic.

$$U \mapsto \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X|U}(\mathcal{F}|U, \mathcal{G}|U)$$
makes a sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. (The restriction should be the natural one.) The question is to show that the functor $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\cdot, \mathcal{G})$ is left-exact (for fixed sheaf $\mathcal{G}$) i.e. if we have an exact sequence of sheaves
$$\mathcal{F}' \rightarrow \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}'' \rightarrow 0$$
then the sequence
$$0 \rightarrow \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{F}'', \mathcal{G}) \rightarrow \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G}) \rightarrow \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{F}', \mathcal{G})$$

Let's take two germs $f, g \in (\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{F}'', \mathcal{G}))_x$ such that their images are equals in $(\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G}))_x$. Let denote the map $ \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}''$ by $\delta$. Then we by definition of the stalk (by direct limit), we have
$$(f \circ \delta)_W = (g \circ \delta)_W \text{ i.e. } f_W \circ \delta_W = g_W \circ \delta_W$$
(as sheaf hom) for some open set $W$ containing $x$; and we want to show that $f_Z = g_Z$ for some open set $Z$ containing $x$. But this does not seems possible since we only know that $\delta_W$ is surjective under the limit. So I don't find anyway to produce such set $Z$.

First I want to point everything that I made: Some introduction: a regular value of a smooth map $\phi:M \rightarrow N$ is a point $a \in N$ such that for each $x \in \phi^{-1}(a)$ the derivative $D\phi_x$ is surjective. If $a$ is a regular value of $\phi$ then $$deg \ \phi=\sum_{x \in \phi^{-1}(a)} sgn \ (det \ D\phi_x)$$ Here in this particular case, $D\phi_x=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 
0 & 0 & -1 & 0\\ 
0 & -1 & 0 & 0\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$, so every $a \in S^3$ is a regular value of $\phi$. Moreover, $\phi$ is a bijection, so the above sum has only one component and $D\phi_x$ does not depend on $x \in S^3$. Then $deg \ \phi = -1$. For the second part of the question, I take the chart $(U,\varphi)$ of $S^3$, where $U=\{(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4):x_1>0\}$ and $\varphi:U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ given by $\varphi(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)=(x_2,x_3,x_4)$. So $\omega=-\frac{1}{x_1}dx_2 \wedge dx_3 \wedge dx_4$ is a well defined orientation on $U$. If we can show that $\omega \circ \phi (=\phi^* \omega) = -\omega$, then we can say that $\phi$ does not preserve orientation (I have a feeling that $\phi$ does not preserve orientation, but if the point was to prove that it does preserve orientation, we have to check every chart in an atlas of $S^3$, which is not quick and interesting at all) So $\omega \circ \phi = -\frac{1}{x_1}d(-x_3) \wedge d(-x_2) \wedge dx_4 = +\frac{1}{x_1}dx_2 \wedge dx_3 \wedge dx_4 = -\omega$. Then $\phi$ does not preserve orientation. Is this all correct? Something that I missed? Thanks!","['orientation', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-forms', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

$$\frac{\pi^6}{960}-1=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k+3)^6}$$ Multiplying the first by $\displaystyle-\frac{63}{2^6}$ and the second by $31^2=961$, then adding them, $$\pi^6-961=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left(-\frac{63}{(2k+2)^6}+\frac{961}{(2k+3)^6}\right)$$
This series can be rewritten in a single positive fraction per term as
$$\pi^6-961=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{57472 k^6+332736 k^5+786480 k^4+957920 k^3+616380 k^2+185316 k+15577}{64 (k+1)^6 (2 k+3)^6}$$ so it directly proves $\pi^6>961$ and hence $\pi^3>31$. However, this lacks the simplicity of the ones for $\pi-3$ and $10-\pi^2$. Q: How can we write $\pi^6−961$ as $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{P(k)}$ where $P$ is a polynomial with nonnegative, rational coefficients? [EDIT]

If the above holds $\forall \lambda a \in \lambda A$ then:

$$ Now for the other inequality, $\forall \lambda a \in \lambda A$ we have:
$$
\lambda a \geq \inf(\lambda A),

so:
$$
a\leq \frac{1}{\lambda}\inf(\lambda A)

and because above holds $\forall a\in A$, we can write:
$$
\sup(A)\leq \frac{1}{\lambda} \inf(\lambda A)

Can they change topologically? If not, what additional structure do we need to define unique isomorphisms between leaves? I think I can prove the following (i.e. I have an idea about the proof, but haven't checked the details. I can post my idea if you want.) Let $F$ be a fixed leaf. Then there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $F$ in $M$, obtained as an union of leaves, such that every leaf in $U$ is a covering of $F$.","['differential-geometry', 'foliations']"
1647867,"Why use C(n,r) instead of P(n,r) when considering how many strings can be formed in which a specific letter appears before another specific letter?","I am dealing with a problem in which I must determine how many strings can be formed by ordering the letters ABCDE subject to the conditions given. The condition that I am given is that A appears before D, examples of which include BCAED, BCADE. In tackling this problem, my first instinct was to utilize the permutation formula, specifically P(5,2) because it seems that we are picking 2 out of 5 elements and ORDERING them. Then I proceeded to multiply P(5,2) by 3! i.e. P(5,2) * 3! my reasoning being that after choosing the positions in which the letters A and D appear in the string, there are still 3! ways to order the remaining elements B,C,E in the string. The answer however is given as C(5,2)*3!, which is exactly what is confusing me. If we are told that A must appear before D doesn't this imply that order matters and that we are dealing with a permutation? I understand that the order of B,C,E is irrelevant, but don't we care about ensuring that A always comes before D? Also, when speaking of combinations, aren't we talking about groups in which order does not matter? It just seems to me that if you use C(5,2) you could be implying that you can have A before D but also D before A in positions 1-5 of your string.

1647884,Decomposition of an algebraic number into a sum or product of algebraic numbers with smaller degree,"An algebraic number can be identified by its minimal polynomial together with isolating intervals with rational bounds for its real and imaginary parts. The degree of an algebraic number is the degree of its minimal polynomial. There are known algorithms that allow to easily compute sum and product of algebraic numbers in this representation, raise them to a rational power, extract real and imaginary parts, compare them, or evaluate them numerically to an arbitrary precision. Is there an efficient algorithm that given an algebraic number $\alpha$ in this representation can decide if $\alpha$ can be represented as a sum or product of algebraic numbers of smaller degree?","['galois-theory', 'polynomials', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'algorithms']"

From what I can gather, the maximal solution of an ODE is the solution to an ODE that exists for the longest time. But why do we care about this? For example, given $\dot x = -x$, the solution is $x(t) = K\exp(-t)$ where $K$ is some constant. Solution exists for all times. And?

1647928,Definition of schematically dense,"In these notes on algebraic groups ( http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/iAG200.pdf ), assume $(X, \mathcal O_X)$ is an algebraic $k$-scheme for some field $k$, and $S$ is a subset of $X(k)$, where $X(k)$ is the set of $x \in X$ for which the residue field $\kappa(x)$ is equal to $k$.  A subset $S \subseteq X(k)$ is said to be schematically dense in $X$ if for any open subset $U$ of $X$, the family of maps $$f \mapsto f(s): \mathcal O(U) \rightarrow \kappa(s) = k; s \in S \cap U$$ is injective.  I don't understand what the definition is saying.  Is it saying that if we fix any $s \in S \cap U$, then the association $f \mapsto f(s)$ defines an injective function $\mathcal O(U) \rightarrow k$?  That seems absurd.  Or is it saying that if we fix any $f \in \mathcal O(U)$, and define a function $S \cap U \rightarrow k$ by $s \mapsto f(s)$, then this mapping is injective.  The latter makes more sense, but the former seems to be the literal interpretation of what was written. I'm trying to make sense out of this with an example.  Let $k = \mathbb{Q}$, and let $X$ be the affine $k$-scheme whose underlying space is the set of maximal ideals of $k[T]$.  Then $X$ is in bijection with the monic irreducible polynomials of $k[T]$, and has the cofinite topology.  Also, $X(k)$ is the set of monic linear polynomials $T - x : x \in \mathbb{Q}$, then we can identify $X(k) = \mathbb{Q}$.  Now if $S \subseteq k$ is schematically dense in $X$, then according to the second possible definition I mentioned, for any $f \in k[T]$, the map $s \mapsto f(s)$ should be injective, since $f(s)$ is the image of $f$ in the residue field $\mathcal O_{X,s}/\mathfrak m_s = \mathbb{Q}[T]/(T-s) \simeq \mathbb{Q}$.  This is also absurd, so the second possible definition I mentioned doesn't make sense either.","['algebraic-groups', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Of course, the stalk at the origin should have torsion, but I can't seem to locate it explicitly. I've wondered about this for a while.

1648154,The magic of the morphisms,"Given a set $X$. Let $S\subseteq X$ and consider $(X,S)$ as a very simple mathematical structure, lets call it a spotted set in analogy with pointed sets . Given two spotted sets, then a morphism $\alpha :(X,S)\longrightarrow(X^\prime,S^\prime)$ reasonably is a function
$\alpha :X\longrightarrow X^\prime$ such that $x\in S\Rightarrow \alpha(x)\in S^\prime$. In topology there is a spotted set $\tau\subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$. Then morphisms are functions $\mathcal{P}(X)\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}\mathcal{P}(X^\prime)$ such that 
$\mathcal{O}\in\tau \Rightarrow \alpha(\mathcal{O})\in \tau^\prime$. If there is a function
$f:X^\prime\longrightarrow X$ such that $\alpha = \mathcal{Q}(f)$, where $\mathcal{Q}$ is the contra-variant power set functor, this correspond to Top and $f$ is continuous with respect to the topologies. There are corresponding coincidences for several other structures, where the formulas of the morphisms can be derived, and my question is if there is an explanation to this correspondence? Examples: Group-like structures as magmas and categories are characterized by relations
$R\subseteq (X\times X)\times X$ and can obviously be expressed as spotted sets. Morphisms are functions 
$\alpha:(X\times X)\times X\longrightarrow(X^\prime\times X^\prime)\times X^\prime$ such that 
$((x,y),z)\in R \Rightarrow \alpha((x,y),z)\in R^\prime$.
Functions 
$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3:X\longrightarrow X^\prime$ exists such that
$\alpha((x,y),z)=((\alpha_1(x),\alpha_2(y)),\alpha_3(z))$ and if $\alpha$ is such that $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=\alpha_3$, then $\alpha_1$ correspond to group homomorphisms etc. Action-like structures $R\subseteq (A\times X)\times X$. Here morphisms are functions 
$(A\times X)\times X\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}(A\times X^\prime)\times X^\prime$ such that $((a,x),y)\in R \Rightarrow \alpha((a,x),y)\in R^\prime$. It exists functions 
$\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\alpha_2$ such that 
$\alpha((a,x),y)=((\alpha_0(a),\alpha_1(x)),\alpha_2(y))$. If $\alpha_0=1_A$ and $\alpha_1=\alpha_2$ this correspond to morphisms of actions . Uniform spaces with a set of entourages $\phi\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X\times X)$. Morphisms are functions 
$\mathcal{P}(X\times X)\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}\mathcal{P}(X^\prime\times X^\prime)$ such that
$\mathcal{U}\in\phi \Rightarrow \alpha(\mathcal{U})\in \phi^\prime$. The condition on the morphisms of spotted sets to correspond to a uniformly continuous function is similar as above. Multigraphs . Function $\varepsilon \subseteq E\times V^2$. Undirected graphs . $E\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$, $e\in E\Rightarrow \alpha(e)\in E^\prime$, 
where $\alpha$ is a function $\mathcal{P}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(X^\prime)$. It might be a good idea to point out that the formula for a morphism only depend on some outer structures. For example in magmas all formulas are the same and doesn't depend of ""inner"" conditions as associativity or inverses, with the exception of certain selected elements as a unit element. If $\tau\subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ isn't a topology but is an other structure, the same formula would still be valid: 
$\alpha$ would be a morphism if there was a funcion $f:X^\prime\to X$ such that 
$\alpha = \mathcal{Q}(f)$ and $\mathcal{O}\in\tau\implies f^{-1}(\mathcal{O})\in \tau^\prime$. There is an obvious an analogy with the Hom functor where magmas and universal algebras correspond to the covariant case, morphisms $\mathbb N\to X$, and the topological case correspond to the contravariant case with morphisms $X\to\mathbb N $.","['morphism', 'big-picture', 'soft-question', 'category-theory', 'general-topology']"
