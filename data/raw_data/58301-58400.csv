641302,Textbook suggestion for studying martingales,"I've been studying probability from Davar Khoshnevisan's graduate textbook since the beginning of the semester. A month ago, I came to the chapter of ""Martingales"". Since it's my first encounter with martingales, I found it a little confusing and hard to grasp. I totally understand the definitions and the theorems, but I feel like I am not seeing the big picture of it. I mean I need to digest it a little more. In such times, reading the same concept from different textbook or from a different perspective of view may help you to complete some missing pieces. My question is: Can you please suggest me a textbook or an article about martingales to read to supplement my textbook?","['probability-theory', 'martingales']"

641348,Definition of algebraic variety,"In general, the definition of an algebraic variety differs from one reference to other. The definition that I was used to is to consider an algebraic variety as an integral scheme of finite type. However this definition differs from the one in the book of Masayoshi Miyanishi (""Algebraic Geometry"", in page 89). The author defines an algebraic variety over a field $k$ as an integral $k$-scheme $X$ (this means that there exists a quasi-compact locally finite generated morphism $f: X \longrightarrow Spec(k)$) of finite type such that the base change by $\overline{k}$ ( $X_{\overline{k}} =X \times_{Spec(k)} Spec(\overline{k})$) is integral of finite type and the structure morphism is a $f: X \longrightarrow Spec(k)$ separated morphism ($\Delta_{X/Spec(k)}: X \longrightarrow X \times_{Spec(k)} X$ is a closed immersion). Could please someone explains why there is these additional assumptions in the above definition? The author just explains briefly (in page 92) why the separateness is useful in this case (he says that $f$ being separated is equivalent to two specializations of a point along a valuation ring $\mathscr{O}$ coincide under the assumption that the induced morphisms $k(x) \longrightarrow Q(\mathscr{O})$ are identical), however I didn't understand this too.

641639,Characterization of a closed mapping,"I'm having troubles with this basic question. I think it is really easy but I feel like blocked or blind with it. Suppose we have a mapping $f\colon X \to Y$ , the following are equivalent: a) $f$ is closed, b) $\forall U$ open on $X$ , $\{y\in Y\mid f^{-1}(y)\subset U\}$ is open on $Y$ , c) $\forall C$ closed on $X$ , $\{y\in Y\mid f^{-1}(y)\cap C\not= \emptyset \}$ is closed on $Y$ . I've tried seeing seeing that, as f is closed, and $X\setminus U$ is closed as $U$ is closed, then it's image is closed, so it complementary is open, and then try to see that $\{y\in Y\mid f^{-1}(y)\subset U\} = Y\setminus f(X\setminus U)$ , but without success. And also try with interior and adherences, but not success again. I hope somebody can give me some clues or telling me what I'm missing.

641657,A holomorphic function is conformal,"I am trying to show that if a function $f = u+iv$ is holomorphic with $\partial_z f(z)$ always non zero, then $f$ is a conformal mapping, i.e. it preserves angles between smooth curves. If $f$ is holomorphic, by Cauchy-Riemann
$$
\begin{vmatrix}
u_x & u_y\\
v_x & v_y

\begin{vmatrix}
u_x & -v_x\\
v_x & u_x

=
u_x^2 + v_x^2 = |\partial_z f|^2 \neq 0,
$$
so changing variables $r, \theta$ s.t.
$$ r = |\partial _z f(z)|, \cos \theta = \dfrac{u_x}{|\partial_z f|}, \sin \theta = \dfrac{v_x}{|\partial_z f|}$$
the jacobian matrix of $f$ becomes

Let $x(u, v)$ be a parametrization of $S$ at $p$ and ${x_u, x_v}$ the associated basis of $T_p(S)$. If $\alpha(t) = x(u(t), v(t))$ is a parametrized curve in $S$, with $\alpha(0) = p$, we have

641809,What specific algebraic properties are broken at each Cayley-Dickson stage beyond octonions?,"I'm starting to come around to an understanding of hypercomplex numbers, and I'm particularly fascinated by the fact that certain algebraic properties are broken as we move through each of the $2^n$ dimensions. I think I understand the first $n<4$ instances: As we move from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ we lose ordering From $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{H}$ we lose the commutative property From $\mathbb{H}$ to $\mathbb{O}$ we lose the associative property (in the form of $(xy)z \neq x(yz)$, but apparently it's still alternative and $(xx)y = x(xy)$. Is that right?) The move from $\mathbb{O}$ to $\mathbb{S}$ is where I start to get fuzzy. From what I've read, the alternative property is broken now, such that even $(xx)y \neq x(xy)$ but that also zero divisors come into play, thus making sedenion algebra non-division. My first major question is: Does the loss of the alternative property cause the emergence of zero divisors (or vice versa) or are these unrelated breakages? My bigger question is: What specific algebraic properties break as we move into 32 dimensions, then into 64, 128, 256? I've ""read"" the de Marrais/Smith paper where they coin the terms pathions, chingons, routons and voudons. At my low level, any initial ""reading"" of such a paper is mostly just intent skimming, but I'm fairly certain they don't address my question and are focused on the nature and patterns of zero divisors in these higher dimensions. If the breakages are too complicated to simply explicate in an answer here, I'm happy to do the work and read journal articles that might help me understand, but I'd appreciate a pointer to specific papers that, given enough study, will actually address the point of my specific interest--something I can't necessarily tell with an initial glance, and might need a proper mathematician to point me in the right direction. Thank you! UPDATE: If the consensus is that this is a repeat, then ok, but I don't see how the answers to the other question about why algebraic properties break answers my questions about what algebraic properties break. Actually, the response marked as an answer in that other question doesn't actually answer that question either. It provides a helpful description of how to construct a multiplication table for higher dimension Cayley-Dickson structures, but explicitly doesn't answer the question as to why the properties break. The Baez article many people suggest in responses to all hyper-complex number questions like mine is truly excellent, but is mostly restricted to octonions, and, in the few mentions it makes of higher dimension Cayley-Dickson algebras, does not refer to what properties are broken. Perhaps the question isn't answerable, but in any case it hasn't been answered in this forum. UPDATE 2: I should add that the sub question in this post about whether the loss of the alternative property specifically leads to the presence of zero divisors in sedenion algebra is definitely unique to my question. However, perhaps I should pose that as a separate question? Sorry, I'm not sure about that aspect of forum etiquette here.","['octonions', 'abstract-algebra', 'quaternions', 'sedenions', 'complex-numbers']"

641855,How can you describe topology to a non-mathematician without using continuous deformations?,"One of the most frequently used ways to describe topology to non-mathematicians is that it studies the properties of objects that are preserved under deformations where ripping or tearing is not allowed. I like this definition, but I've realized recently that it gives the wrong idea. In fact, this describes isotopy instead of homeomorphism. Does it matter? Take an annulus, cut it into a strip of paper. Twist it once and glue, then you get a Möbius strip. Twist is twice and glue, what you get is another annulus. But there is no way to deform a standard annulus into a doubly twisted annulus. So the intuition is very wrong here. In addition topology is much bigger than manifolds and isotopies anyways.

  $$ f(z)= \sum_{i=-m}^m A_i z^i$$
  where the $A_i$ are $n\times n$ matrices and $f(z) \in G(\mathbb C)$ for all $z \in \mathbb C^\times$. I believe that I understand the second statement regarding $G(\mathbb C[z,z^{-1}])$ but it required use of the equivalence of the category of finite type integral affine schemes over $\mathbb C$ with the category of affine varieties. This may not be the best way of dealing with this, but I do not know another way to nicely characterize those scheme morphisms. Unfortunately, $G(\mathbb K)$ is not amenable to this approach because it is not of finite type. (Edit: By this I mean $\mathbb K$ is not of finite type.) How do we realize the first statement regarding $G(\mathbb K)$? The (closed?) embedding $G \hookrightarrow GL_n$ should realize $G$ as a closed subscheme of $GL_n$, so that we are looking at $G(\mathbb K) \subseteq GL_n(\mathbb K)$. Despite the nomenclature ""$\mathbb K$-valued points of $G$ ($GL_n$)"" suggesting that the answer should be what it is, I do not understand the naming convention, nor how to see it directly. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Edit: Let's see if I can clarify where I think my issue is occurring. Let $G$ be a (smooth) complex semisimple linear algebraic group. From what I can see, we have three ways of thinking about $G$: as a manifold, as a scheme in terms of the spectrum of an algebra, and as a group scheme given by a functor of points. Given an embedding $G \hookrightarrow GL_n(\mathbb C)$ (as say, manifolds), how does this correspond to an embedding $G \hookrightarrow GL_n$ as affine group schemes (thought of as functors of points)? Does $G \hookrightarrow GL_n(\mathbb C)$ correspond to some map on closed points $G(\mathbb C) \hookrightarrow GL_n(\mathbb C)$ which lifts to a map of affine group schemes? Taking as the definition $GL_n(\mathbb C) = \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb C[x_{ij}]_{i,j=1}^{n+1}/(\det \cdot y -1) )$ and $R$ a $k$-algebra, can one recover the functor $GL_n: \text{Alg}_k \to \text{Grp}, R \mapsto GL_n(R)$ from this? I would posit that I'm really just having trouble reconciling all of the different ways of thinking of $G$ (or $GL_n$).","['affine-schemes', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'algebraic-groups']"

642139,Local cohomology with respect to a point. (Hartshorne III Ex 2.5),"I'm trying to do Hartshorne's exercises on local cohomology at the moment and seem to be stuck in Exercise III 2.5. The problem goes as follows: $X$ is supposed to be a Zariski space (i.e a Noetherian and sober topological space) and $P\in X$ a closed point. Let $X_P$ denote the subset of $X$ consisting of all points specializing to $P$, and give it the induced topology. Let $j:X_P\rightarrow X$ be the inclusion map and write $\mathcal F_P=j^{-1}\mathcal F$ for any sheaf (of abelian groups) $\mathcal F$ on $X$.

H_P^i(X,\mathcal F) = H^i_P(X_P,\mathcal F_P)

I tried to do this with the standard procedure by showing effaceability of these functors for $i>0$. So first I tried to show that pulling back along $j$ preserves flsaqueness, but meanwhile I'm quite convinced that this isn't true. I do not see why injectives would go to injectives, either. Then I thought maybe for special sheaves like sheaves of discontinuous sections flasqueness is preserved, but, as before, it didn't lead anywhere. Does anyone have some good advice?

where $\chi_A(t)= 0$ if $t\not\in A$ and $\chi_A(t) = 1$ if $t\in A$. I would like to determine directly from the joint PDF $f_{X,Y}$ the PDF of the random variable $Z:=X+Y$, and also to determine the joint PDF of the vector $(Z,W)$ where $W:=\min\{X,Y\}$. The first part isn't hard since I introduce a random variable $U:=Y$ in order to obtain the inverse of the measurable transformation, that is:
$$ \{z = x+y; u = y \leadsto \{x = z-u; y = u $$
so since the Jacobian of the inverse is $1$ I would get
$$ f_Z(z) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{Z,U}(z,u) du = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(z-u) f_Y(u) du. $$
where the integrand is 0 unless $0 \leq z-u< 1 \implies z-1 < u\leq z$ and $0< u < 1$. This gives me
$$ f_{Z}(z) = \left\{
\begin{array}{lll}
\int_0^z 4(z-u)u du &= \frac{2}{3} z^3 & \text{if } 0 < z < 1,\\
\int_{z-1}^1 4 (z-u)u du &= -\frac{2}{3} (z^3 -6z + 4) & \text{if } 1 \leq z < 2\\
0 & & \text{otherwise.}\end{array}
\right. $$
I've checked that $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_Z(z) dz = 1$. (Is this correct?, is there a shorter approach?). However, for the second part I'm having doubts because of the definition $\min\{X,Y\}$.
A first attempt I've considered is using
$$ F_{W}(w) = \mathrm P(W\leq w) = \mathrm P(\min\{X,Y\} \leq w\} = 1- \mathrm P(\min\{X,Y\} > w) = 1-\mathrm P(X > w, Y > w)  $$
$$ = 1- \mathrm P(X > w) \mathrm P(Y > w) = 1-(1- F_X(w)) (1-F_Y(w))=\cdots $$
since $\min$ is not differentiable.

I followed different lines of thought and mention $3$ of them below: $1.$ I tried using $\sin x<x<\tan x$. Knowing that $\sin x$,$\tan x$ increase in the mentioned interval, I tried applying $\tan$ and $\sin$ on different sides of $\sin x<x<\tan x$ in order to achieve something like that in the question.. But I just could not come to the inequality in the question. $2.$ I tried using the function $f(x)=\sin(\tan x)-x$. $f(0)=0$. If we prove that the derivative $f'(x)=(\sec ^2 x)(\cos(\tan x))-1$ is positive, then we will be done. But proving even this seems very difficult. $3.$ Since $\arcsin x$ is one-one and increasing in the mentioned interval, we can take $\arcsin$ on both sides of the inequality $\sin (\tan x) \geq {x}$ to get $\tan x > \arcsin x$. Thus proving  $\tan x > \arcsin x$ would be equivalent to solving the problem. All the three approaches are seeming impossible.. Any suggestions or other methods?

642557,Showing Measurability of empirical process (with respect to ball measurability),"I'm currently working on a problem in a certain proof which i do not fully comprehend, so i'm asking here to hopefully get some help for understanding :-) The situation of the problem is the following: $X:\Omega\rightarrow D(\mathbb{R}^2_{+})$  is a stochastic process which is locally uniformly bounded on every compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2_{+}$ with $D(\mathbb{R}^2_{+})$ denoting the space of cadlag functions (left side limits exist, right continuous) over $\mathbb{R}^2_{+}$. It can be shown that $X$ ist measurable with respect to the ball-$\sigma$-field on $D(\mathbb{R}^2_{+})$ but not the corresponding Borel-$\sigma-$field (with underlying uniform metric). Well so far so good, problem is now the following expression: $P\left( \underset{\substack{|x_{1}-x_{2}|^2+|y_{1}-y_{2}|^2<\delta \\ x_{1},x_{2},y_{1},y_{2}\in[0,1]}}{\sup} \left|X(x_{1},y_{1})-X(x_{2},y_{2})  \right|  \geq \varepsilon    \right)$   for arbitrary $\delta,\varepsilon>0$. Why is it possible to take probability here? How can we conclude measurability for this expression from the above stated ball measurability?

Edit 2: To be even more precise, is there any possibility to write the above expression as $P\left( X \in K_{\varepsilon,\delta}   \right)$ where $K_{\varepsilon,\delta}$ lies in the ball-$\sigma-$field of $D(\mathbb{R}^2_{+})$?","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory']"

Let $D$ be a dense subset of $\mathbb R$ and show that $f : X \to \mathbb R$ is measurable if $\{x \in X: f(x) \le d\}$ is measurable for all $d \in D$. My attempt: $f$ is measurable iff for all $c \in \mathbb R$ we have that $\{x \in X: f(x) > c\} \in \mathbb X$. \
Let $c \in \mathbb R$. Since $D$ is dense in $\mathbb R$, for any $c \in \mathbb R$ there is a sequence $(d_n) \subset D$ such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} d_n = c$. Hence
\begin{align*}
\{x : f(x) > c\} &= \cup_{n = 1}^\infty \{x: f(x) > d_n, \, d_n \ge c\} \cup \cap_{n = 1}^\infty \{x : f(x) > d_n, \, d_n < c\}.

642601,Maximum and minimum Correlation Coefficient,"I have a question regarding the correlation coefficient. The inspiration is from a story where a student collected a set of $(X,Y)$ pairs, but lost the pairings. Hence, he is left with two sets of values of $X$ and $Y$. Say we have eight readings each and the values of $X$ are $\left\{ 4, 6, 7, 3, 3, 1, 9, 4\right\}$ and the the values of $Y$ are $\left\{ 4, 5, 2, 2, 4, 2,7, 9\right\}$. I am asked to find the highest and lowest possible correlation coefficient given these values. Now, the naive way to find this is to maximize and minimze $\mathbb E (XY)$ since $\rho_{X,Y}= (\mathbb E(XY) - \mathbb E (X) \mathbb E(Y))/\sigma_X \sigma_y$ and the respective (unconditioned, of course) means and variances are fixed. So what I did was to arrange the values of $X$ and $Y$ in ascending order, multiply the paired values to get $\mathbb E_{\text{max}} (XY) = 25.75$ and so $\rho_{X,Y_{\text{max}}}=0.9619$. To get the minimum, I multiply the minimum of $X$ with the maximum of $Y$ and move backwards up the list of $Y$ to get $\mathbb E_{\text{min}} (XY) = 15.13$ and so $\rho_{X,Y_{\text{min}}}=-0.891$. My question is that is there a more elegant way like a differentiation method to do so? I believe someone here could enlighten me. I do not feel comfortable with this result as it feels like I am brute forcing my way through, and cannot find a way to convincingly say the values are the maximum or minimum.","['statistics', 'correlation']"

A function $f\colon [0,a]\times [0,b] \to \mathbb R$ is Borel if and only if for any $x\in[0,a]$ the slice $f_x$ is Borel (as a function $[0,b]\to \mathbb R$) the function $x\mapsto f_x$ is Borel (as a function $[0,a]\to \mathscr F$) This claim is somewhat similar to the fact that $L^1([0,a]\times [0,b]) = L^1([0,a]; L^1([0,b]))$ which follows from Fubini's theorem. But in the claim above we say nothing about the measure... Note that if $f\colon [0,a]\times [0,b] \to \mathbb R$ is Borel then point 1 holds, because intersection of any Borel set with $\{x\}\times[0,b]$ is Borel for any $x\in [0,a]$. Is the point 2 true?

(I already did the second condition where $\frac {a} {2b}$))  If we square the first condition and subtract, that gives us $(c^2-d^2)$; since this also equals $2(abc - a^2 d + 2b^2 d)=0$, we can multiply both sides by $(c^2-d^2)$ to get the final result. UPDATE #2: Actually, the more I thought about it, this is correct. $2) \displaystyle x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta = \cos (3 \theta)$; $x \sin \theta - y \cos \theta = 3 \sin (3 \theta)$ I'm not sure where to start...I've tried squaring both equations, multiplying, etc.  (The answer for this is $\displaystyle(x^2 + y^2)(x^2+y^2+18)+8x(x^2-3y^2) = 27$.) UPDATE: I was able to get the following for x and y (thanks to the suggestion!) $\displaystyle x= 2\cos 2 \theta - \cos 4 \theta$ $\displaystyle y = 2\sin 2 \theta + \sin 4 \theta$ UPDATE 2/16/14: BREAKTHROUGH! Never mind...that answer bombed out. UPDATE 2/17/14: Not giving up and using the advice below, I finally got $\displaystyle c = \frac {(x-1)^2 + (y^2-4)}{12}$...I'm going to plug this in to the equation for x and see how it goes.  If all works well, I should finally get the answer, save all the cleanup work. Never mind.

642796,Nice problem of combinatorics..,"I know a family that has $10$ children and half of them are married. Sometimes they ask me about mathematics, and ask me to show them nice things... I asked them: How many possible ways there are to pick $5$ of your children and that $3$ of them (at our selection) will be married? I explain them that this is a problem at combinatorics. My answer (and I'll be glad if you will correct me): $$\binom{5}{3}\cdot \binom{5}{2}$$  Why? First of all we choosing $3$ married children from the $5$ that we have - and this is $\binom{5}{3}$. Than, we have another more $5$ children to choose $2$ from them, and this is why we have   $\binom{5}{2}$. If the question was that we can have more then $3$ married children so the answer will be:$$\binom{5}{3}\cdot \binom{7}{2}$$ Why? Because we move the unchosen married children to the group of the unmarried children... At the next section I asked the same thing but I added one more thing - that the minimum of married children can be $1$ and the maximum is $4$ (e.g. at $2$ there can only be $2$ married children and no more... IF there can be more it will $7$ at the right binom and 5), my answer is: $$\sum_{i=1}^{4}\binom{5}{i}\cdot \binom{5}{5-i}$$ I'm right? I just want to tell you that I didn't show my answers to the family, I put here to know if I'm right... Thank you!","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
642801,Show $(h_1\mu_1)\otimes\ldots\otimes (h_n\mu_n)=h(\mu_1\otimes\ldots\otimes\mu_n)$ (and that this is a probability measure),"Let $\mu_1,\ldots\mu_n$ be $\sigma$-finite measures and $h_i$ probability densites on $(\Omega_i,\mathcal{A}_i,\mu_i),~i=1,\ldots,n$. Show that for 
    $$
h(\omega_1,\ldots\omega_n):=\prod_{i=1}^{n}h_i(\omega_i)
$$
    it is
    $$
(h_1\mu_1)\otimes\ldots\otimes (h_n\mu_n)=h(\mu_1\otimes\ldots\otimes\mu_n)
$$
    and that this defines a probability measure. Good evening, The first thing I showed was that the measures $h_i\mu_i, i=1,\ldots,n$ are $\sigma$-finite measures on $(\Omega_i,\mathcal{A}_i), i=1,\ldots,n$, i.e. it makes sense to talk about the product measure of the measures $h_i\mu_i, i=1,\ldots,n$. ( Is this a $\sigma$-finite measure? ) Starting on the LHS, I get the following: For $A:=A_1\times\ldots\times A_n\in\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n}\mathcal{A}_i$ it is
$$
(h_1\mu_1)\otimes\ldots\otimes (h_n\mu_n)(A)=\int_{\Omega_1}\ldots\int_{\Omega_n}(1_A)_{\omega_1\times\ldots\times\omega_{n-1}}(\omega_n)\, dh_n\mu_n\ldots\, dh_1\mu_1\\=\int_{\Omega_1}\ldots\int_{\Omega_n}1_{A_1}(\omega_1)1_{A_2}(\omega_2)\cdot\ldots\cdot1_{A_n}(\omega_n)\, dh_n\mu_n\ldots\, dh_1\mu_1\\=\int_{A_1}\int_{A_2}\ldots\int_{A_n}\, dh_n\mu_n\ldots\, dh_2\mu_2\, dh_1\mu_1\\=\int_{A_1}\int_{A_2}\ldots\underbrace{\int_{A_n}h_n\, d\mu_n}_{=h_n\mu_n(A_n)}\ldots\, dh_2\mu_2\, dh_1\mu_1\\=h_n\mu_n(A_n)\int_{A_1}\ldots\int_{A_{n-1}}h_{n-1}\, d\mu_{n-1}\ldots \,dh_1\mu_1\\=h_{n-1}\mu_{n-1}(A_{n-1})h_n\mu_n(A_n)\int_{A_1}\ldots\\=\ldots\\=h_1\mu_1(A_1)\cdot h_2\mu_2(A_2)\cdot\ldots\cdot h_n\mu_n(A_n)\\=\prod_{i=1}^{n}h_i\mu_i(A_i)
$$ Starting on the RHS, I get for $A$:
$$
h(\mu_1\otimes\ldots\otimes\mu_n)(A)=\int_A h\, d(\mu_1\otimes\mu_2\ldots\otimes\mu_n).
$$
Because the $\mu_i, i=1,\ldots,n$ are $\sigma$-finite, $h$ is measurable (because $h_i, i=1,\ldots,h_n$ are measurable) and $h$ is non-negative (because $h_i, i=1,\ldots,n$ are non-negative), one can apply Fubini:
$$
h(\mu_1\otimes\ldots\otimes\mu_n)(A)=\int_A h\, d(\mu_1\otimes\mu_2\ldots\otimes\mu_n)\\=\int_{A_1}\ldots\int_{A_n}h_{\omega_1\times\ldots\times\omega_{n-1}}(\omega_n)\, d\mu_n(\omega_n)\ldots\, d\mu_1(\omega_1)\\=\int_{A_1}\ldots\int_{A_n}h_1(\omega_1)\cdot h_2(\omega_2)\cdot\ldots\cdot h_n(\omega_n)\, d\mu_n(\omega_n)\ldots\, d\mu_1(\omega_1)\\=\prod_{i=1}^{n}h_i\mu_i(A_i)
$$
So it is LHS=RHS. Because $A$ was arbitrarily chosen out of $\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n}\mathcal{A}_i$, this identity holds for any $A\in\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n}\mathcal{A}_i$. So both measures (LHS and RHS) are identitical. Now it remains to show that this defines a probability measure.
From the shown identity it follows that it does not matter which measure (LHS or RHS) I choose to show that. I choose the right side. If I see it right, the only thing to show is that
$$
h(\mu_1\otimes\ldots\otimes\mu_n)(\times_{i=1}^{n}\Omega_i)=1.
$$
But this follows from the fact that $h_i, i=1,\ldots,n$ is a probability density and so
$$
h_i\mu_i(\Omega_i)=\int_{\Omega_i}h\, d\mu_i=1, i=1,\ldots,n.
$$
From this it follows with the result above
$$
h(\mu_1\otimes\mu_1\otimes\ldots\otimes\mu_n)(\times_{i=1}^{n}\Omega_i)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}h_i\mu_i(\Omega_i)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}1=1.
$$ $\Box$ Is my proof right? Or is there anything additional to show in order to prove that it is a probability measure? With greetings math12","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"
642807,"Are functions arbitrary? If so, is that okay?","I'm learning about functions between sets. I get the concept. But I'm having a hard time drinking the kool-aid, so to speak. There's some part of my mind that thinks (loudly), Wait. How does this author justify claiming that he can connect two things together however he likes. There has to be some justification to connect them . But I get that -really- all a function between two sets is doing is saying is This is what things would look like if you connected the elements of these two sets But still, intuitively, it strikes me as potentially problematic. For instance, we used to be able to assign any element we wanted to a set - that turned out to be a problem. I don't necessarily wonder whether functions would lead to the same problem, but perhaps to some other problem arising from arbitrarily relating things? Do functions have the potential to lead to that kind of a problem, or any other problem? Is there a better way to think of them than I've described?","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(h)+f(-h)}{h^{2}}
\\
\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{h^{2}}\int_{0}^{h}f(x)dx
$$ Regarding the first limit, I came up with he following, although I'm not sure it's correct: Given that: $$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(h))}{h^{2}}=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(-h))}{h^{2}}$$ This gives: $$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(h)+f(-h)}{h^{2}}=2\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(h)}{h^{2}}=2\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h} \frac{1}{h}=
2 \left [\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(0+h)-f(0)}{h} \ \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{h}  \right ]$$ Which tends to $+\infty$ As I said, I'm not completely convinced by my reasoning.

642854,Lower bound for the size of an atlas,"This question came up in a graduate-level class on differential topology I'm currently taking; the instructor couldn't come up with an answer off the top of her head and while I'm very new to the subject, it struck me as the kind of thing for which there ought to already be some results. Let $M$ be a (not-necessarily smooth) manifold. Is there any information on the least number of pairs $(U_i, \phi_i)$ where $U_i$ is an open subset of $M$ and $\phi_i: U_i\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a homeomorphism needed to produce an atlas for $M$? Or, perhaps a better way of phrasing the question is, is there any information on a smallest open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $M$ with the property that all the covering sets are homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$? Some examples I can work out pretty easily on my own are spheres of any dimension (where compactness of the sphere proves that 1 chart is not sufficient and the stereographic projection proves that 2 charts are) the torus (which appears to require 4 charts (although I don't have a proof for this and if a counterexample exists I'd love to hear about it)), and the surface of genus 2 (which appears to require 6 but I'm less sure of this because I can't quite construct the charts). [Edit: I overlooked the obvious fact that an orientable surface with an embedding in 3-space can be covered by exactly two charts with no effort. The math overflow link in the comments provides many wonderful references, but I'm still wondering if there are others that may have been missed there. Edit to the edit: In fact, the above observation I made above is incorrect, because as Anthony Carapetis points out in the comments, those charts are not contractible in general. However, the comments agree that 3 charts suffice for any surface, and armed with the suggestion I have been able to imagine such atlases for surfaces of low genus. A reference has not been produced yet, although in my spare time I'm still searching for one.] If anyone is familiar with any reading materials that may shed some light on this question and any answers--partial or otherwise--which may already exist, I'd be pretty happy to have a reference. Also, I hope the algebraic topology tag is appropriate; I assume if there is anything like an answer that it can be stated in algebro-topological terms.","['manifolds', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
642863,Real-life question: How to determine the winner of a quiz,"Imagine there's a quiz on the internet intended for a wide audience. It contains a (unlimited) number of questions, all of them with yes/no answers. A person gets one random question and must answer it, after that he can get another one. He can continue answering any number of questions he wants. So the only data you have is: Peter: 37 out of 45 questions correct
Mary: 42 out of 190 questions correct
John: 0 out of 127 questions correct
(etc.) Now if you want to make a list of winners, how would you sort them the clever way ? If you sort the people simply by the percentage of person's correct answers then the easy way to win is to correctly answer just one question (or two, three, ...). If you sort the people simply by the number of person's correct answers then an easy way to win is to spend a loong evening answering (or merely guessing) the questions. Then Mary (42 out of 190 correct) wins over Peter (37 out of 45 correct) even if Peter is significantly better. So is there any sophisticated way how to choose a proper winner based on having just this type of data?
