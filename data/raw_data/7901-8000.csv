59846,Proof of no prime-representing polynomial in 2 variables,"In ""The New Book of Prime Number Records"", Ribenboim reviews the known results on the degree and number of variables of prime-representing polynomials (those are polynomials such that the set of positive values they obtain for nonnegative integral values of the variables coincides with the set of primes). For example, it is known that there is such a polynomial with 42 variables and degree 5, as well as one with 10 variables and astronomical degree. Ribenboim mentions that it's an open problem to determine the least number of variables possible for such a polynomial, and remarks ""it cannot be 2"". It's a fairly simple exercise to show that it cannot be 1, but why can't it be 2? EDIT: here's the relevant excerpt from Ribenboim's book. Given that nobody seems to be familiar with such a proof, I'm inclined to assume that this is a typo and he just meant ""it cannot be 1"".","['prime-numbers', 'number-theory']"

59920,Curious Properties of 33,"Because my explanation has so many words, I'll start with my question and then you can read the explanation if you need to: The Bernstein Hash method uses the number 33 as a multiplier.  From what I've read Bernstein himself has no reasonable explanation as to why 33 has such useful properties.  I'm wondering if the mathematics community has any theories on the matter. The explanation: I'm a software engineer and I was recently working on a blog post about a hash function I was writing.  In the process of designing my hash function, I looked at a lot of implementations of other hash functions. For non-programmers, the gist is that the hashcodes produced by objects should be well distributed throughout the range of values in a 32 bit integer (-2,147,483,648 through 2,147,483,647). Let's say I have the string ""ABCD.""  A hash function would loop through each character, get the ASCII value of it, do something to it and aggregate it into a composite hashcode. For example, in a lot of implementations, they'd take a hashcode initialized to a large prime, multiply it by another prime and the XOR it with the value of 'A' which is 65.  Then, they'd take that and multiply it by the same prime and XOR that with the value of 'B'.  They'd do this until the end of the string is reached. I found a clever implementation in the Java framework code that loops over each item and effectively applies this: $i = ((i \ll 5) - i) \oplus j$.  I was confused at first until I worked out that $(i \ll 5) - i = 31i$.  For a computer, bit shifting is faster than multiplying so this is a clever way to multiply by a prime number. So, I looked in Microsoft's .Net framework and I found that they do it a little differently.  They use $(i \ll 5) + i$ instead!  I couldn't figure out for the life of me why they used 33 instead of 31 because from what I understand multiplying by prime numbers is the foundation of many hashing and cryptographic functions. I found out that this technique is called the Bernstein Hash and that Bernstein himself doesn't know why 33 produces such a good distribution of values as a multiplier in hashing functions.","['hash-function', 'computer-science', 'number-theory']"

59923,Finite differences of function composition,"I'm trying to express the following in finite differences: $$\frac{d}{dx}\left[ A(x)\frac{d\, u(x)}{dx} \right].$$ Let $h$ be the step size and $x_{i-1} = x_i - h$ and $x_{i+ 1} = x_i + h$ If I take centered differences evaluated in $x_i$, I get: $\begin{align*}\left\{\frac{d}{dx}\left[ A(x)\frac{d\, u(x)}{dx}\right]\right\}_i 

&= \frac{\left[A(x)\frac{d\, u(x)}{dx}\right]_{i+1/2} - \left[A(x)\frac{d\, u(x)}{dx}\right]_{i-1/2}}{h} \\

If I use forward or backward differences I need A values at $i$, $i + 1$, $i + 2$ and at $i$, $i -1$, $i -2$ respectively. Am I on the correct path? I would really appreciate any hint.

59984,General question about differential equations,"I have never studied differential equations and have just run across some notes that involve one.  I have a discrete function P that maps points in time (e.g. day1, day2, day3....) onto some real number on the interval [0, 1]. $P(t+1) = (1-3a)P(t) + a(1-P(t))$ the notes then define the change in P to be: $\Delta P(t) = P(t+1) - P(t) = (1-3a)P(t) + a(1-P(t)) - P(t) = a - 4aP(t)$ Ok, fine.  The notes then go on to say let's instead treat time as continuous.  As such the rate of change of this continuous function is: $ dP(t)/dt =  a - 4aP(t)$ The notes then state that the solution to this differential equation is: $P(t) = 1 / 4 + (P(0) - 1 / 4)e^{-4at}$ My question is for what values of $t$ does the above equation hold?  It appears to me from the broader context of this problem that this equation does not in fact hold for any specific $t$ but only for an unfixed $t$ as $t$ increases without bound.  As such, if I wanted to know the value of $P(500)$ in the continuous case I can't actually use this equation.  Is this understanding correct?",['ordinary-differential-equations']
59985,Trying to get the infinite product for $\sin x$,"I start with the fact that the zeros of $\sin x$ are $ n\pi$, $n\in\mathbb{Z}$.

From here I cannot factor out $\pi^2$ as there are infinite terms and $\pi^\infty$ doesn't look reasonable. If I take out $n^2$ then I have $$x(n!)^2 \prod_{n=1}^\infty (\frac{x^2}{n^2} - \pi^2)$$

60124,"Question about proof of ""nonsingularity of a point iff the local ring at that point is regular""","In Hartshorne, page 32 Theorem 5.1, the theorem says ""Let $Y\subset\mathbb{A}^n$"" be an affine variety. Let $P\in Y$ be a point. Then $Y$ is nonsingular at $P$ if and only if the local ring $\mathscr{O}_{P,Y}$ is a regular local ring. Now in the proof, Hartshorne puts $P=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$, $a_P=(x_1-a_1,\ldots,x_n-a_n)$ the maximal ideal corresponding to $P$ in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and $b$ the ideal of $Y$ in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. Also, $m$ is the maximal ideal in the local ring $\mathscr{O}_{P,Y}$ corresponding to the point $P$. Now, he says that $\mathscr{O}_{P,Y}$ is obtained by dividing $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ by $b$ and then localizing at the maximal ideal $a_P$. This is ok (even though it really should be the localization at $(a_P+b)/b$, not at $a_P$, but I guess we can identify $a_P$ with its maximal ideal in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/b$). Now comes my question, he says that because of this, $m/m^2\cong a_P/(a_P^2+b)$, and thus their dimensions are the same. However, I see that since $m$ is the localization of $(a_p+b)/b$, then this would really be $m/m^2\cong S^{-1}((a_P+b)/b)/S^{-1}((a_P^2+b)/b)$ (where $S$ is the multiplicative set with which one localizes), and I don't see how $S^{-1}((a_P+b)/b)/S^{-1}((a_P^2+b)/b)\cong a_P/(a_P^2+b)$.

Similarly, in number theory, we are interested in patterns and structure possessed by algebraic integers and algebraic prime numbers. Some googling and wiki-ing gave me that topology studies about deformation of objects in some space i.e. how an object in some space behaves under a continuous map. However, when I started reading the subject it starts of by defining what a topology is i.e. a set of subsets of a set with certain properties. I fail to see the connection immediately.

If every infinite subset of $X$ is in $\tau$, prove that $\tau$ is the discrete topology My idea was to show that every singleton set is in the topology and thereby the topology is discrete. Choose an infinite set $A$ from $X$ such that $A^c$ is also infinite. $A$ and $A^c$ belong to $\tau$ since they are infinite sets. Now consider any $x \in X$.

60444,Making trigonometric substitutions rigorous,"I've been tutoring some basic calculus, and it made me think about something pretty basic. Let me explain the problem by example: Say we are given the integral $\int \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\ \mathrm dx$. It is then customary to write $x=\cos(\alpha), \mathrm dx=-\sin(\alpha)\ \mathrm d\alpha$. So: 
$$\begin{align*}
\int \frac{\cos^2(\alpha)}{\sqrt{\sin^2(\alpha))}}(-\sin(\alpha))\ \mathrm d\alpha&=-\int\frac{\cos^2(\alpha)}{\sin(\alpha)}\sin(\alpha)\ \mathrm d\alpha\\
&=-\int \cos^2(\alpha)\ \mathrm d\alpha\\
&=-\int\frac{1+\cos(2\alpha)}{2}\ \mathrm d\alpha\\
&=-\frac{\alpha}{2}-\frac{\sin(2\alpha)}{4}\\
&=-\frac{\alpha}{2}-\frac{\sin(\alpha)\cos(\alpha)}{2}.
\end{align*}$$ We know plug in $\alpha=\arccos(x)$. It is left to know what $\sin(\arccos(x))$ is. For this, we now we pretend that $0\leq \alpha\leq \frac{\pi}{2}$ and draw a triangle which shows via the Pythagorean theorem that $\sin(\arccos(x))=\sqrt{1-x^2}$. Similarly there are the common substitutions $x=\tan(\alpha)$ and $x=\sec(\alpha)$. This technique seems less than rigorous. Here are some of my issues with it: At first it seemed to me like this is $u$-substitution in reverse (think that $x$ plays the role of $u$ and $\alpha$ plays the role of $x$). But in $u$-substitution, if the substitution is $u=g(x)$ then we eventually plug in $g(x)$ instead of $u$. But here the roles are reversed. So it seems that this really is ordinary $u$-substitution. But then that means that the substitution is $\alpha=\arccos(x)$ -- however there are many ways to choose inverses to $\cos$ and $\arccos(x)$ is only one of them. Are we really choosing just that one? I feel uncomfortable with $\sqrt{\sin^2(x)}=\sin(x)$. What if $\sin(x)$ is negative? What's going on here? Is the issue that we are just doing it on a segment where $\sin(x)$ is positive, do the whole thing, and then after we get an answer we do some argument using analytic continuation?
Or is perhaps the issue that we are looking at $-1<x<1$ (because that's where $\sqrt{1-x^2}$ is defined), and so $\arccos(x)$ would go from $0$ to $\pi$ where $\sin(x)$ is positive? Would this weird argument also work for other trigonometric substitutions? That part at the end where we figure out what the trigonometric function of an inverse trigonometric function is (in my example $\sin(\arccos(x))$ is fishy to me. To figure it out I draw a triangle, which seems to assume $\arccos(x)$ is between $0$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$. What's going on there. So, while I'm very familiar with the method, tutoring it made me realize I'm not sure what's really behind it. Could it really be something as complicated as analytic continuation behind it? Is there a uniform way of explaining this method with respect to the substitutions $x=\cos(\alpha), x=\tan(\alpha)$ and $x=\sec(\alpha)$?","['trigonometry', 'calculus', 'integration']"
60445,Numbering students inequality problem,"Ten students are sitting around a campfire. A teacher randomly assigns each student a different number from 1-10. Another teacher assigns a new number to each student with the requirement that the new number assigned to a student is equal to the students' old number plus the sum of the two numbers of his neighbors. Prove or disprove : one of the students must have a new number STRICTLY GREATER than 17. What I have done so far: It is very easy to show that one of the students must have a new number strictly greater than 16. This can be done by assuming that each of the numbers is less than or equal to 16. A quick sketch is as follows: Label the students $a_1, \dots a_{10}$. By contradiction, we have: $a_1+a_2+a_3 \le 16$ $\dots$ $a_{10} +a_1+a_2 \le 16$ Summing up: $3a_1+\dots +3a_{10} \le 16\cdot 10$ This is a contradiction as $a_1+\dots + a_{10} = 55$ But this argument breaks down when we try it for 17. Im not even sure that the proposition that a student must have a number more than 17 is even correct!

60480,Rings of integers are noetherian (question about a specific proof),"I'm reading Neukirch's book about Algebraic number theory and I totally fail to understand something. At one point he proves that the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ of a number field $K$ is noetherian in the following manner: ""every ideal is a finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$-module by (2.10) and therefore a fortiori a finitely generated $\mathcal{O}_K$-module."" Now 2.10 is the claim that for an integrally closed, principle ideal domain A, F its field of fractions, L a finite separable extension of F and B the integral closure of A in L, we have that ""every finitely generated B-submodule $M\ne 0$ of L is a free A-module of rank $[L:F]$"". I fail to see how 2.10 is used here. I guess in our case $F=\mathbb{Q}, L=K, A=\mathbb{Z}, B=\mathcal{O}_K$. So I know that every finitely generated $\mathcal{O}_K$ submodule (in other words, ideal) is a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module, which is additional information; but how can I assume that the ideal is finitely generated in the first place?

We are trying to compute a particular sum of the error term in Stirlings approximation.  The immediate simple approaches don't seem to work. Attempt: Why $\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$: By partial summation we know that $$\sum_{n=1}^M \frac{1}{n^s}= \frac{M^{1-s}}{1-s}+\zeta(s)+O\left(M^{-s}\right)$$ for $s>0$, $s\neq 1$.  This tells us where the $\frac{\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$ comes from since $$\sum_{n=1}^M \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi n}}=\sqrt{\frac{2M}{\pi}}+\frac{\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}+o(1).$$ Now all that remains is to prove that $$\sum_{n=1}^M  \frac{n^n}{n!e^n}=\sqrt{\frac{2M}{\pi}} -\frac{2}{3}+o(1).$$ I am kinda stuck here, as this series seems strange to deal with.
