1664331,Network contagion,"Suppose I have an undirected, unweighted network in which some node, $i$, is infected.  This (and any) infected node has probability $p$ of infecting adjacent nodes. Is there a closed form expression of the probability that an arbitrary node $j$ becomes infected?  Any references would be much appreciated! My thought is that this should be somehow related to the resistance distance between the nodes. EDIT: So after some simulations there doesn't appear to be much relationship with resistance distance.  I think this is because resistance can be understood as a situation where `voltage' doesn't change as additional paths are added.  Here however, adding more connections to the infected source node (in some sense) increases the outward flow of contagion (a voltage analog) EDIT 2:  Let me be more clear about the process I have in mind.  Take a connected undirected graph,$G$, as given.  Some node, $i$, starts out as infected.  In period 1, each node adjacent to $i$ has probability, $p$, of becoming infected.  In subsequent periods, for each newly infected node, each of its uninfected neighbors has probability $p$ of becoming newly infected for the next period.  Can we characterize the probability that an arbitrary node, $j$, becomes infected after infinitely many periods?","['graph-theory', 'network', 'probability']"

1664417,$52$ cards reciprocal sum probability,"Imagine a deck of $52$ cards but instead of having suits and ranks, they only have sequential (unique) integer ranks from $1$ to $52$. You could also imagine a standard deck of $52$ cards but convert the ranks and suits to an integer number from $1$ to $52$ so that all the cards have different numbers assigned to them. So the question is, what is the probability, if you randomly choose exactly $10$ cards from that deck without replacement, that the sum of the reciprocals of the cards ranks (from $1$ to $52$) totals exactly $1$?  For example, if you chose cards $5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45$ and $50$, the sum of the reciprocals would only be $0.58579$... so that is too small. As a hint, I believe if you sort the cards in ascending order, the first card (the lowest rank card) MUST be between a $2$ and $6$ (inclusive) to be a candidate solution.  This is because $1/1$ is already a sum of $1$ so any additional cards will make it too large a sum.  Also $7$ as a lowest card will not work cuz $1/7$ + $1/8$... + $1/16$ = $0.93$...  so the lowest card MUST be a $2,3,4,5$, or $6$.  I am re-running my modified simulation now with that added information to prune the state space it must check. Also I am seeing multiple solutions so there is not just $1$ solution but the probability is likely very low, only a small fraction of $1$% I would guesstimate. Also note than many solutions are very close to $1$ but not exactly $1$, thus making computer simulation of this type of problem more difficult.  An example of a ""close solution"" is $2,4,13,25,35,41,47,50,51,52$ which evaluates to $0.99999995750965$.  The closest sum not equal to $1$ happens with $3,4,8,14,17,22,26,29,46,47$ which evaluates to $1.00000000288991$.  That is $8$ zeros after the $1$. An interesting note...  That number very close to $1$ is gotten by summing only $10$ terms.  This is impressive since even summing negative powers of $2$ which converges to $1$, ($1/2$ + $1/4$ + $1/8$...), it takes $28$ terms to almost match that closeness to $1$ and $29$ terms to beat it.",['probability']

For each solution $n(m,t)$ with $t\le m\lt\frac{n}{2}$, there exist 3 others solutions: $n(t,m)$, $n(n-m,n-t)$ and $n(n-t,n-m)$. I have found the following four polynomial families of non-trivial solutions: $$ m(k) = 4 k - 1 , n(k) = 8 k + 1, t(k) = 2 k$$ $$ m(k)= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}, n(k) = k^2 + 4 k + 4, t(k) = 2$$ $$ m(k) = \frac{(k+1)(3k+2)}{2}, n(k) = 3 k^2 + 8 k + 6, t(k) = 3$$ $$ m(k) = \frac{(k+1)(3k+4)}{2}, n(k) = 3 k^2 + 10 k + 9, t(k) = 3$$ and the corresponding symetric families according to the above identies. By numerical observation, the other non-trivial  solutions look more sporadic. Illustration: This is a plot of the $m,n<131$ for which there exists $t<n+m$ such that $m,n,t$ is a non-trivial solution to the equation $ S(m,n+m,t)=\sum_{i=0}^{t}(-1)^i\binom{m}{i}\binom{n}{t-i}=0 $ The green, blue and black dots correspond to the above polynomial families of solutions, and the red dots are for the other non trivial solutions.

1664617,Where are sheaves in the functor of points perspective?,"Let $X$ be a scheme over a ring $S$, and $F$ some quasicoherent sheaf on $X$. The ""functor of points"" says that we can think of $X$ as the functor representing all of the $R$-points, for $R$ an $S$-algebra. This recovers the classical point of view, since it expresses the scheme as something which is locally the solution set to some equations over an $S$-algebra. Here locally means open subfunctors, and being a solution to some equations over $R$ would be like the $R$ points of $S[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/(f_1, \ldots, f_m)$ I would like to understand how quasicoherent sheaves fit into this point of view. The natural guess is that they arise as compatible families of things which are locally modules over these sets of $R$ points. But precisely what functor to SET do they represent? It no longer makes sense (I think) to ask about morphisms from $Spec R$ to the quasicoherent sheaf $F$ on $X$. One could consider the pullbacks, for each $R$ point $f: Spec R \to X$, we have the $R$ module $f^*(F)$. The equation $(f \circ g)^* \cong g^* \circ f^*$ suggests that this almost works, expect that this equation isn't literally an equality (I have heard that this causes problems).

1664722,Twin-prime sieve,"My question concerns the following sieve (call it S), which was an exercise in applying some elementary aspects of Brun's sieve while reading Halberstam's text. Using the Chinese Remainder theorem we can show : (S) The number of $n$ such that $n,n+2$ are co-prime to $p_k\#$  for $n =1,2,...,p_k\#$ is $$\prod_{i=1}^k (p_i-2).$$ So for example on $[1,5\#]$ there are 3 pairs n,n+2 co-prime to 2,3,5 and those are $(11,13),(17,19),(29,31).$ The smallest prime dividing any sieved $n$ is 7, and because $7^2$ is larger than $2\cdot3\cdot5$ it must be that the largest power of this minimal prime (a factor of $n$ or $n+2$) is 1. Therefore the sieved pairs are twin primes. For larger $p_k\#$ the minimal prime $p$ (the smallest such that $p< p_{k}\#< p^2$) is larger than $p_{k+1}.$ Put another way, the power $\Omega$ of $p_{k+1}$ such that $(p_{k+1})^{\Omega}\leq p_k\#$ is increasing.  The best we can say using (S) is that $n,n+2$ have at most $\Omega$ prime factors, and $\Omega$ grows without bound as $k$ gets large. For small $k$ we can avoid the problem in a facile way. Call the modified sieve S'. As an example, on the interval $[1,13\#]$ the number of $n,n+2$ co-prime to $13\#$ is 1485. Unfortunately $p_{k+1}=17$ and $17^3 <13\#. $ So the best we can say is that $n,n+2$ have at most 3 prime factors. However if we sieve (the same interval) using $p_{40}\#=173\#,$ then $p_{k+1} = 179$ and 179, not by accident, is the smallest prime $p$ such that $p < 13\# < p^2.$ Because we are using more primes to sieve the same interval, the number of counted (co-prime to $p_{40}\#$) pairs $n,n+2$ falls from 1485 to 456. On the other hand, because 179 is the smallest prime occurring in any sieved pair and cannot occur as a power greater than one (else it exceeds 13#), all 456 pairs are twin primes (I checked.) While one might hope show that the cardinality of prime pairs $n, n+2$ is increasing with $k$  despite the need to choose increasingly large minimal primes (in the sense above), what seems more likely (because simple approaches like this were discarded en route to Brun's sieve) is that as increasingly large primes are needed, even if they are small compared to $p_k\#$, a point is reached beyond which $|\{n, n+2\}|$ is no longer increasing. But the reason for this eludes me. There may be some other issue here, so my question is: Can someone explain why S' fails, or give an argument that the number of sieved pairs using S' above will eventually fail to increase as $k$ gets large? In the spirit of ""What have you tried?"" let $p_{k+m}$ be the the smallest prime s.t. $p_{k+m}< p_k\# <p_{k+m}^2 $ or $$p_{k+m}~ \text{minimal s.t.}~ p_{k+m} > p_k\#^{(1/2)}.$$ For large $k,$ $p_{k+m}$ is relatively close to $p_k\#^{(1/2)}$ and the proportion of the interval $[1,p_k\#]$ being sieved is $$\sim(1-1/\sqrt{p_k\#}).$$ So the number of primes greater than $p_k$ on the interval $[\sqrt{p_k\#},p_k\#]$ is $$\sim p_k\#/\log p_k\#\sim p_k\#/p_k.$$ The number of multiples of $p_{k+1}, p_{k+2},..., p_{k+m}$ on the same interval is $$p_k\#/p_{k+1}+p_{k\#}/p_{k+2},... = p_k\#(1/p_{k+1}+1/p_{k+2}+...+1/p_{k+m})$$ and $$1/p_k < 1/p_{k+1}+1/p_{k+2}+...+1/p_{k+m}. $$ So even though the number of primes is increasing, relatively few survive the sieve and we can't be sure the cardinality of sifted pairs is strictly increasing...? Notation: $p\#$ := $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5...\cdot p.$ The intervals $[1,p_k\#]$ are actually $[1,p_k\#+2]$ but it's hard to read and doesn't affect the question.","['number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'prime-numbers', 'sieve-theory']"

To find the area of a circle with my method is to first split the circle in half and first find the area of that and then multiply it by 2 in the end to make our life easier. A half circle is made out of bunch of vertical ""lines"" and I thought one could use integrals to add these ""lines"" up to get the area. To do this we need to find a function to get the length of one ""line"" and then integrate the function. If we draw a right triangle inside the half circle, the task will become easy. constructing a half circle triangle inside the half circle Now, to get $l$, we use sine: $l=r\cdot \sin(φ)$ Then we take the integral with respect to $φ$.

However there are surfaces with higher genus (higher numbers of ""holes"") which also can be represented as polygons (4$g$ polygon for a surface of genus $g$) with sides indetified. However higher genus surfaces are negatively curved.

1664789,Composition series for Verma modules.,"Let $L$ a Lie Algebra. I need prove that that every Verma module $\Delta(\lambda)$ admits a composition series, i.e a series of submodules with simple factors. 
I found a proof that is quite short in this scripts , at Proposition 5.5.
At the end of the proof, when builds a concrete series, the term $M_i$ is given and is considered $M_i$ a maximal sub-module of $M$. I am not too much sure how it is obvious that such a maximal sub-module exists. I thought to two ways to proceed, the first is to consider that $M$ is a sub-module of a Verma module, that the weights of $M$ are bounded by above and deduce (in someway, if it is true) that there is a finite number of maximal weights of $M$, say $\mu_1 \dots \mu_n $. Then since $\text{dim}$ $ M_{\mu_i} < \infty$ we can choose a basis $B_i$ of $M_{\mu_i}$. If $M$ is generated by all $v \in B_i$ for all $i$, then we can conclude using the theory of finitely generated modules (in particular, this question ). The second way is to consider a maximal weight $\mu$ of $M$ and $v \in M_\mu$, then try to prove that $M'=\sum N $, where the sum is over all the submodules of $M'$ that don't contain $v$, is maximal in $M$. Then, how can I prove that the factors (and their occurrence) are independent on the choice of the Jordan-Holder chain?","['modules', 'abstract-algebra', 'verma-modules', 'representation-theory', 'lie-algebras']"

1665054,Intuition behind the renewal equation,"So. I've acquired the unenviable task of having to learn renewal theory on my own. I'm finding most of it to be pretty intuitive, except for one thing. The intuition behind the renewal equation has completely eluded me. Every resource I've found so far basically dives right in with something like: If $f$ is a function in $[0,\infty)$ bounded on finite intervals and $F$ is a measure on $[0,\infty)$, an equation of the type $Z = f + Z \ast F$ is called a renewal equation . If $f$ is directly Riemann integrable, then the solution to this equation is given by... If $F(\infty) < 1$ then the equation is defective and if $F(\infty) > 1$ then the equation is excessive... etc... But... where does this equation even come from and why is it so important? It's just one possible relation out of many. Is there a natural, simple example to see how it arises in a basic, pure renewal process? I'm having a pretty hard time finding a textbook which does a good job of this. For example, I can derive that if I have a renewal process with renewal function $m(t)$ and interarrival distribution $F$, then $$ m = F + m \ast F $$ But when I move to more complicated functions besides $F$, I'm no longer sure what the result is saying. For example in the above example, the general solution for renewal equations says that $m$ also has a convolution form involving the measure $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} F^n$, where $F^n$ is the distribution of the $n$th renewal time. I can see that this measure is just the renewal function, but I'm having trouble interpreting it. I know it's asking a lot, but can someone de-mystify some of this? If it helps at all, I have a pretty decent grasp of measure-theoretic probability (but not good enough, apparently) and I'm trying to follow Asmussen's chapter on renewal theory.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'point-processes']"

Here's my thoughts.  The answer is probably some finite number based on $\alpha$ if $\alpha$ is rational and infinitely many if $\alpha$ is irrational.  So I'd like to confirm (or disprove) that guess. First we start with the formula $$(\cos(\alpha \pi) + i\sin(\alpha \pi))^n = \cos(n\alpha \pi) + i\sin(n\alpha \pi)$$ If $\alpha$ is rational, then I can see that some of the powers would be the same.  Let $\alpha = \frac pq$, then we'd get $\cos(n\alpha \pi) + i\sin(n\alpha \pi) = \cos(m\alpha \pi) + i\sin(m\alpha \pi) \iff n\alpha \pi = m\alpha \pi + 2\pi k$.  This implies that $$(n-m)p=2kq$$ So whenever that condition is satisfied, then the $n$th power and $m$th power will be the same.  But I don't see how to count those possibilities. Then if $\alpha$ is irrational, we'd still need $n\alpha \pi = m\alpha \pi + 2\pi k = (m\alpha + 2k)\pi$, but this time $\alpha \ne \frac pq$.  So we'd just get $$\alpha = \frac{2k}{n-m}$$ The right hand side is always rational, so there is no pair $(n,m)$ for which this holds.  So there are infinitely many solutions if $\alpha$ is irrational. So it seems I've gotten the irrational case, but I can't see how to count up the solutions in the rational case.",['complex-analysis']
1665572,Proof of semigroup property for family of operators,"I'm studying a proof of a large deviations principle and I'm having trouble with a part that is concerned with the semigroup property of a family of operators. Assumptions $(X_t)_{t\geq0}$ is a symmetric random walk on $\mathbb Z^d$. $\mathbb E_x$ designates the expectation given that $X_0=x$. Let $Q \in \mathbb Z^d$ be a finite connected subset.
$\mathbb R^Q$ is the set of functions from $Q$ to $\mathbb R$. $\ell_t$ defined by $\ell_t(z)=\int_0^t \mathbb 1_{\{X_s=z\}}\mathrm ds=\int_0^t \delta_{X_s}(z)\mathrm ds$ for $z\in\mathbb Z^d$ and $t>0$ are the local times of the walk, measuring the amout of time that the random walk spends in state $z$ up to time $t$. For an arbitrarily fixed $V\in\mathbb R^Q$ and $t>0$ define the operator $P_t^V$ on $\mathbb R^Q$ as
$$P_t^V f(x)=\mathbb E_x \left[\mathrm e^{\int_0^tV(X_s)\mathrm ds}f(X_t) \mathbb 1_{\{\mathrm{supp}(\ell_t)\subset Q\}} \right]$$
for $x\in Q$ and $f\in\mathbb R^Q$. Problem I don't get a remark in the proof that claims it's easy to check that the family $(P_t^V)_{t\geq0}$ is a strongly continuous semigroup of linear, continuous operators on $\mathbb R^Q$. Unfortunately, I have no prior knowledge of semigroups and I don't quite get why this is true. Mentioning continuous, I should say a word about the norm on $\mathbb R^Q$: Since $Q$ is finite, we can identify $\mathbb R^Q$ with the Hilbert space $\ell^2(Q)$ (of sequences in $\mathbb R$ indexed over $Q$) and consider the standard dot product on that space as well as the $2$-norm induced by that dot product. However, I'm mainly concerned with the algebraic properties of $(P_t^V)_{t\geq0}$ because only those are relevant for the proof. That $P_0^V$ is the identity operator/matrix is easy to see even for me. But I'm heaving trouble to ascertain that $P_t^V \circ P_t^V=P_{t+s}^V$. Let $x\in Q$ and $f\in\mathbb \ell^2(Q)$ be arbitrarily chosen. Then we get something like
$$P_t^V\left(P_s^V f(x)\right)=\mathbb E_x \left[\mathrm e^{\int_0^tV(X_h)\mathrm dh}P_s^Vf(X_t) \mathbb 1_{\{\mathrm{supp}(\ell_t)\subset Q\}} \right]=\mathbb E_x \left[\mathrm e^{\int_0^tV(X_s)\mathrm ds}\mathbb E_{X_t} \left[\mathrm e^{\int_0^sV(X_h)\mathrm dh}f(X_s) \mathbb 1_{\{\mathrm{supp}(\ell_s)\subset Q\}} \right] \mathbb 1_{\{\mathrm{supp}(\ell_t)\subset Q\}} \right]$$

My intuition is to start with $\vert f(z) - L \vert < \epsilon$ and manipulate this until the expression on the left looks like $\vert z-z_0 \vert$.

$$S = \sum\limits_{t \in E} \sum\limits_{x \in E} (t + x)(t + x^2)...(t+x^{2p})$$ where $E$ is a set of all $p$-th roots of unity and $p$ is a prime number. I also know the right answer (but cannot get the solution yet): $$S = p (\binom{2p}{p} + 4p - 2)$$ Small clarification: you don't have to read the wall of text below. This is just my attempt to get an answer and the real problem has been already told in the begging. So, what I have done: The plan goes like this: First fix $t$ and sum $x$ Split the sum into two sums for $x = 1$ and $x \neq 1$ ($S(t) = S_1(t) + S_2(t)$) The last step is to sum $t$. Lets find out $S_1(t) = \sum\limits_{t \in E} (t + 1)(t + 1^2)...(t+1^{2p})$.
Obviously, it is $S_1(t) = \sum\limits_{t \in E} (t + 1)^{2p}$ The first problem is to find out $S_2(t)$. I think, I can prove that:
$$S_2(t) = \sum\limits_{w \in E \setminus \{1\} } (t + w)(t + w^2)...(t+w^{2p}) = (p - 1)(t + w_1)(t + w_1^2)...(t+w_1^{2p})$$
where $w_1 = exp(\frac{2\pi i}{p})$ But I am not sure that is actually true. this is can be rewritten as:
$$(p - 1)((t + w_1)(t + w_1^2)...(t+w_1^p))^2$$
The next problem is to find the value of $$(t + w_1)(t + w_1^2)...(t+w_1^p)$$
It is easy to find the coefficient of $t^p$ (clearly, it is $1$), $t^{p-1}$ (not so obvious, but it is $0$ for sure) and $t^0$ (easy to show that it is $1$). So, my guess is that the hole polynomial equals to $t^p+1$. If I was correct (but I still want the proof for all this statements), then:
$$S = \sum\limits_{t \in E} [(t+1)^{2p} + (p - 1)(t^p+1)^2]$$
Let's split it again:
$$S' = \sum\limits_{t \in E} (p - 1)(t^p+1)^2 = 4 p (p - 1)$$
$$S'' = \sum\limits_{t \in E}(t+1)^{2p} = \sum\limits_{t \in E} \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2p} \binom{2p}{i} t^i = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{2p} \binom{2p}{i} \sum\limits_{t \in E} t^i$$
But I think (but have not proven that yet) that $\sum\limits_{t \in E} t^i = 0$ for every $i \neq p$. And then we can rewrite $S''$:
$$S'' = p \binom{2p}{p}$$ And the final result is then:
$$S = S' + S'' = 4 p (p - 1) + p \binom{2p}{p} = p(\binom{2p}{p} + 4p - 4)$$

Proof: Since $f''(0)=2$ then $\exists\delta>0$ such that for any $t\in \mathbb{R}^1$ with $0<|t|<\delta$ we have $\left|\frac{f'(t)}{t}-2\right|<1 \Leftrightarrow$ $1<\frac{f'(t)}{t}<3$. For $t\in(0,\delta)$ we have $f'(t)>t>0$ then $f'(t)>0$ and for $t\in(-\delta,0)$ we have $f'(t)<t<0$ then $f'(t)<0$. Hence $f$ strictly increases on $(0,\delta)$ and strictly decreases on $(-\delta,0)$ with $f(0)=0$. Hence $0$ is strict local minima of $f$.

Give examples to show that this result fails if either (a) $X$ is non-reduced, or (b) $Y$ is non-separated. [Hint: Consider the map $h : X \rightarrow Y \times_S Y$ obtained from $f$ and $g$.] I can solve the problem in case ``agree on an open dense subset of $X$'' , say $U$, means that $f|_U = g|_U$ as morphisms i.e. not only do the continuous maps agree but the sheaf parts also agree and I don't seem to need the assumption that $X$ is reduced. I guess the problem only means the continuous maps agree. In that case, how does one make use of the assumption that $X$ is reduced to solve the problem? I have tried many examples and it seems that when $X$ is reduced, the only open dense set is the whole space $X$ in which case there is nothing to do.

1666291,semantics or do I have a gap in my understanding of multivariable limits?,"Consider the limit $$\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} \frac{x^4-y^4}{x^2- y^2}$$ Now, many would argue  that:
$$\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} \frac{x^4-y^4}{x^2- y^2} = \lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} \frac{(  x^2-y^2)( x^2+y^2)}{ x^2-y^2}$$
$$\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} \frac{x^4-y^4}{x^2- y^2} = \lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} (x^2+y^2) = 0$$ Yet, when I read the (or some, in some book) definition it says if $f(x,y)$ is a real function defined at every point  in  an open disk
  containing $(a,b)$ excluding the point $(a,b)$ etc $\epsilon$... etc $\delta$.. If we accept the above definition, or something similar, then the above limit does not exist. However if we define a new function curing the issue, then we have a limit.. such as $$F(x,y)=
\begin{cases}
\frac{x^4-y^4}{x^2- y^2} &\text{if } x^2\ne y^2 ,\\
 x^2+ y^2 &\text{if } x^2=y^2

1666293,Expressing $(-8)^{\frac13}$ in polar form,"I want to express $(-8)^{\frac{1}{3}}$ in polar and cartesian coordinates. What I did was to solve the equation $-8 = r^3e^{3i\theta}= r^3(\cos(3\theta)+i\sin(3\theta))$ which implies that I must solve the equations
$$
r^3\cos(3\theta) = -8
$$
and the equation
$$
r^3\sin(3\theta)= 0
$$
The latter gives me $\theta = 0, \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{2\pi}{3},\dotsc$ and so using $\theta = 0$, using the equation $r^3\cos(3\theta) = -8$, I get $r = -2$ and in this case the polar and cartesian form is $-2$, then using $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}.$ I get $r =2$ and so the polar form is $2e^{\frac{\pi}{3}}$ and the cartesian form is $1+i \sqrt{3}$ and finally using $\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}$ I get $r=-2$ and in polar form the answer is $-2e^{\frac{2\pi}{3}}$ and in cartesian coordinates the answer is $-1 + i \sqrt{3}$.
