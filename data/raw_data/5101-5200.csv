37641,Finding integrating factor (IF) when integrating factor IF will be a function of both $x$ and $y$,"I'm not finding any resource or description or systemic methodology to find integrating factors when the integrating factor will be a function of both $x$ and $y$ . I'm on this problem, $$
( y - xy^2 ) dx + (x + x^2y^2) dy = 0
$$ In its present form its not exact, but multiplying through by an integrating factor $ \frac{1}{x^2y^2} $ does make it exact. Now I want to know how you find that, when the integrating factor is both a function of $x$ and $y$ . The technique on this page for finding an integrating factor $u(x)$ fails. Which means there's no function of purely $x$ that will make this equation exact. So I'm trying something like this: ####1. Multiply the original equation by a function $u(x,y)$ : $$
u(x,y)( y - xy^2 )dx + u(x,y)(x + x^2y^2)dy = 0
$$ ####2. Attempt to set $\frac{\partial M(x,y)}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N(x,y)}{\partial x} $ $$
\frac{\partial}{\partial y} u(x,y)( y - xy^2 ) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} u(x,y)(x + x^2y^2)
$$ (The two sides must be equal for u(x,y) to make the original equation exact, since $ \frac{\partial M(x,y)}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N(x,y)}{\partial x} $ for an exact equation) ####3. Now you have: $$
u_y(x,y)(y-xy^2) + u(x,y)(1-2xy) = u_x(x,y)(x+x^2y^2) + u(x,y)(1+2xy^2)
$$ I'm kind of stuck now. What is the next step, or is this an incorrect start?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"
37647,If $\sum a_n b_n <\infty$ for all $(b_n)\in \ell^2$ then $(a_n) \in \ell^2$,"I'm trying to prove the following: If $(a_n)$ is a sequence of positive numbers such that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n b_n<\infty$ for all sequences of positive numbers $(b_n)$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n^2<\infty$, then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n^2 <\infty$. The context here is functional analysis homework, in the subject of Hilbert spaces. Here's what I've thought: Let $f=(a_n)>0$. Then the problem reads: if $\int f\overline{g}<\infty$ for all $g>0,g\in \ell^2$, then $f\in \ell^2$. This brings the problem into the realm of $\ell^p$ spaces. I know the inner product is defined only in $\ell^2$, but it's sort of like saying: if $\langle f,g\rangle <\infty$ for all $g>0,g\in \ell^2$ then $f\in \ell^2$. I read this as: ""to check a positive sequence is in $\ell^2$, just check its inner product with any positive sequence in $\ell^2$ is finite, then you're done"", which I find nice, but I can't prove it :P From there, I don't know what else to do. I thought of Hölder's inequality which in this context states:
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nb_n \leq \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n^2 \right)^{1/2} \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n^2 \right)^{1/2}$$ but it's not useful here.","['hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

studied standalone independently of

independently of integers and

numbers, $\mathbb{R}$, regarded as a

integers and rational numbers, is
$\mathbb{R}$ regarded  as a special

37688,Self-collisions in a stack of cards,"(Copied verbatim from: A Project Euler thread I made in December of 2009 .) Lets say you have cards numbered from 1 to 5. You want to organize them into a stack such that you can move 1 card from the top to the bottom and turn over the next card to reveal a 1. Put it off to the side and move two cards from the top of the stack (one at a time) to the bottom. The next card is revealed and is a 2, which is then set aside. Repeat until you have 1 card left which will be 5. In order to achieve this, the cards must be ordered as such: [3, 1, 4, 5, 2] But what if I want to order 10 cards this way? Well...the required pre-order is then [9, 1, 8, 5, 2, 4, 7, 6, 3, 10]. Then I started wondering if there were any cases where the card's number was its actual position in the stack before the dealing. What a surprise! 7 ([5, 1, 3, 4, 2, 6, 7]) has 4 ! It turns out that 7 is the first number where the sequence generated thus has more than 2 self-collisions, as I call them. The first one to have 5 is 543, the first one to have 6 is 3117, and the first one to have 7 is 3226. I have not found one for 8 yet, but there may be a 9 before the first 8. If anyone can find an analytical solution to the following questions...I will be greatly amazed... :P What is the first one to have 8 self-collisions? What about 9? What about 10? P.S.

My thoughts so far: Is this even a question? If $f$ is analytic, then we can write $ f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n $ valid for all $ z \in D(0,1) $. Then $ f(0) = 0 $ gives that $ a_0 = 0 $. Then we can write a Laurent series $ g(z) = \frac{a_0}{z} + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_{n+1} z^n $, and as $ a_0 = 0 $, the point 0 is necessarily a removable singularity (and it's already been removed by setting $ f(0) = 0 $!)

37741,Can the Binomial Theorem be proved probabilistically?,"I believe that the answer is affirmative, as there is a reputable-appearing subscription-hidden link on the web claiming such, and because, although I have not seen that proof, I have (I believe) a proof of my own (which I’m pretty sure is similar to the hidden one). Here is the link to the subscription-hidden article. And here’s my take on the question that I have posed: Using elementary Probability Theory, and an appeal to symmetry and continuity, it is easy to prove the Binomial Theorem.
First, we note that it is easy to establish that $\binom{n}{k}$ = C(n,k), by first (easily) establishing the formula for P(n,k), and then (easily) modifying it to give C(n,k). We can easily show that the binomial coefficients must be C(n,k) for the expansion of ${(x + y)}^n$, for positive integers x and y, by noting the following situation:
If an urn contains x white balls and y black balls, then, given that (exactly) $n$ balls are selected, with replacement, the events:
0. picking n white balls
1. picking n – 1 white balls and 1 black ball
2. picking n – 2 white balls and 2 black balls
…
n – 1. picking 1 white ball and n – 1 black balls
n. picking n black balls
are mutually-exclusive and exhaustive events, and so the sum of their probabilities is unity.
However, it is obvious that the number of ways in which event k can occur is C(n,k). Since all the terms have a denominator of ${(x + y)}^n$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by ${(x + y)}^n$ to get the Binomial Theorem. The case for arbitrary integers x and y follows by symmetry, and the case for arbitrary real numbers x and y follows by continuity. Done. Notation: $\binom{n}{k}$ is $\frac{n!}{(k!)(n – k)!}$, C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time, and P(n,k) is the number of permutations of n things taken k at a time.","['probability', 'combinatorics']"
37745,Equivalent definitions of ordinals?,"The first definition of an ordinal number I found was that an ordinal number is the $\in$-image of a well-ordered set $(A,\lt)$. From this definition it was derived that an ordinal is just the set of all lesser ordinals under the $\in$ well-ordering, and every ordinal is a transitive set. Looking into other sources, I found that the $\in$ function is not even mentioned, but instead an ordinal is just defined as any transitive set of transitive sets. I see how the first definition implies the second, since any ordinal is transitive. But how does the second definition, which seems less restrictive to me for some reason, imply the first? Thank you.","['ordinals', 'elementary-set-theory', 'definition']"
37755,Integrating $\frac{x^k }{1+\cosh(x)}$,"In the course of solving a certain problem, I've had to evaluate integrals of the form: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{x^k}{1+\cosh(x)} \mathrm{d}x $$ for several values of k. I've noticed that that, for k a positive integer other than 1, the result is seemingly always a dyadic rational multiple of $\zeta(k)$, which is not particularly surprising given some of the identities for $\zeta$ (k=7 is the first noninteger value). However, I've been unable to find a nice way to evaluate this integral. I'm reasonably sure there's a way to change this expression into $\int \frac{x^{k-1}}{e^x+1} \mathrm{d}x$, but all the things I tried didn't work. Integration by parts also got too messy quickly, and Mathematica couldn't solve it (though it could calculate for a particular value of k very easily).

37799,"Does a ""backwards"" choice function imply the Axiom of Choice?","One of my favorite formulations of the Axiom of Choice is that for any nonempty family $A$ of nonempty sets, there is a choice function $F\colon A\to\cup A$ such that $F(X)\in X$ for each $X\in A$. Using this, I was able to prove that there is also a function $f\colon\cup A\to A$ such that $x\in f(x)\in A$ for all $x\in\cup A$. I did this by considering any $x\in\cup A$, and letting $B_x=\{X\in A\mid x\in X\}$, and then letting $C=\{t\in\mathscr{P}(A)\mid \exists_{x\in\cup A}t=B_x\}$, i.e. $C$ is the set of all $B_x$. Now each $B_x$ is nonempty, so there is a choice function $F$ such that $F(B_x)\in B_x$ for each $B_x$. Defining $f(x)=F(B_x)$, I have $x\in f(x)\in A$ for every $x\in\cup A$. I suppose this is what I mean by a ""backwards"" choice function, even though it's not really one. Is this equivalent to AC? That is, if for any set $A$, there exists a function $f\colon\cup A\to A$ such that $x\in f(x)\in A$ for all $x\in\cup A$, then AC holds? I couldn't immediately see a way to imply the Axiom of Choice, in any equivalent formulation assuming that the above is true for any set $A$. Is it just a one way implication?

37817,The maximum number of straight making ranks,"Poker nerd question here... I'll start out with some definitions of standard poker terms: A flop is $3$ cards chosen from a $52$ card deck. For example: $789$ (suits are irrelevant to this question). If you draw a fourth card from the deck you get a turn card . A straight is 5 cards in succession, for example $56789.$ When making a straight, an Ace can count both as $1$ and $14$. For example, $TJQKA$ is a straight, and so is $A2345$. However, you cannot ""wrap around the ace"": For example, $KQA23$ is not a straight. Finally, a holdem hand is just 2 cards chosen from a 52 card deck. Now, here's a definition I've made up myself. Let's say we are given a flop F. I define a straight making card for F as a turn card T for which there is a holdem hand H such that H didn't make a straight on F, but H makes a straight on F and T combined. A straight making rank is the rank of a straight making card. For example, 5 is a straight making rank for the flop 789 because the holdem hand 46 makes a straight on 7895, but not on 789. (The straight being made is 45678). All in all, 789 has four straight making ranks: 5,6, T and J. (4 and Q don't count because 56 (and TJ) were already making straights.) EDIT: In the context of this question, the holdem hand must use both of its two cards to make a straight. So, for example, the hand K6 making a straight on a 7895 board doesn't count. Now I have this conjecture: (*) No flop has more than 6 straight making ranks. Having examined a number of different flop types, I'm pretty sure that (*) is true. I'm just wondering if someone can come up with an elegant, succinct proof? (I admit that ""elegant"" and ""succinct"" are subjective terms).","['card-games', 'combinatorics']"

37827,Restricted Direct Products in Koch's Number Theory,"On p.353 of Number Theory: Algebraic Numbers and Functions by Helmut Koch, he considers a group $G$ which is the restricted direct product of the locally compact abelian groups $G_i$ with respect to subgroups $H_i$ for $i \in I$, some index set.

He then writes:
""For each $i \in I$ for which $H_i$ is defined we select that Haar measure on $H_i$ with $\int_{H_i} d \xi_i = 1$...On the compact group $G^S = \prod_{i \notin S} H_i$ we take the Haar measure $d \xi_S$ with $\int_{G^S} d\xi_S = 1$ and on $\prod_{i \in S} G_i$ the product measure $\prod_{i \in S} d\xi_i$. Then by $$\int_G f(\xi) d\xi = \int_{G^S} f(\xi_S) d\xi_S \times \prod_{i \in S} \int_{G_i} f(\xi_i) d\xi_i,$$ where $\xi_S$, respectively $\xi_i$, denotes the projection of $G$ onto $G^S$, respectively $G_i$, the Haar measure on $G$ is determined uniquely and independently of the choice of $S$. We denote it by $\prod_{i \in I} d\xi_i$. I don't understand where the equality of the integrals is from.

37871,Non-numerical vector space examples,"I've recently been thinking about why my peers and other people I've helped learn vector spaces had trouble intuitively understanding the concept, and it occurred to me that non-numerical (i.e. nothing like $\langle 3,2,3 \rangle$ or obvious addition/multiplication operations) examples could reinforce intuition. For example, a huge problem was understanding that a vector space is simply a set of vectors with two operations that follow 10 axioms, and that a zero vector isn't necessarily all zeroes, and so on. Does anyone have any great examples of vector spaces (and the vectors and operations in them, of course) that are non-numerical, and thus can't lead to those trying to prove their validity to being stuck in ruts (like assuming the zero vector is all zeroes, that the inverse vector is the negative scalar multiple, etc.)? Pictures, letters, and any others would certainly be interesting!

37889,Why is the error function defined as it is?,"$\newcommand{\erf}{\operatorname{erf}}$
This may be a very naïve question, but here goes. The error function $\erf$ is defined by
$$\erf(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2}dt.$$
Of course, it is closely related to the normal cdf
$$\Phi(x) = P(N < x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-t^2/2}dt$$
(where $N \sim N(0,1)$ is a standard normal) by the expression $\erf(x) = 2\Phi(x \sqrt{2})-1$. My question is: Why is it natural or useful to define $\erf$ normalized in this way? I may be biased: as a probabilist, I think much more naturally in terms of $\Phi$.  However, anytime I want to compute something, I find that my calculator or math library only provides $\erf$, and I have to go check a textbook or Wikipedia to remember where all the $1$s and $2$s go.  Being charitable, I have to assume that $\erf$ was invented for some reason other than to cause me annoyance, so I would like to know what it is.  If nothing else, it might help me remember the definition. Wikipedia says: The standard normal cdf is used more often in probability and statistics, and the error function is used more often in other branches of mathematics. So perhaps a practitioner of one of these mysterious ""other branches of mathematics"" would care to enlighten me. The most reasonable expression I've found is that
$$P(|N| < x) = \erf(x/\sqrt{2}).$$
This at least gets rid of all but one of the apparently spurious constants, but still has a peculiar $\sqrt{2}$ floating around.","['statistics', 'normal-distribution', 'special-functions', 'probability']"
37891,Injection of $E(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}}$ into $\tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_p)$?,"I'm looking at Example VII.3.3.3 (p.193, 2nd ed.) of Silverman's The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves . We have the elliptic curve $E:y^2=x^3+x$, with discriminant $\Delta=-64$, so there is good reduction for all primes $p\geq 3$. It is noted that $(0,0)$ is a point of order two in $E(\mathbb{Q})$, and that 
 $$\tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_3)=\{\mathcal{O},(0,0),(2,1),(2,2)\}\cong\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$$
 $$\tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_5)=\{\mathcal{O},(0,0),(2,0),(3,0)\}\cong(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^2$$
Then it is said that Since $E(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}}$ injects into both of these groups, we see that $(0,0)$ is the only nonzero torsion point in $E(\mathbb{Q})$. Now, my understanding of Proposition VII.3.1b (p.192, 2nd ed.) is that for any discretely valued local field $K$ with residue field $k$, the reduction map from $E(K)[m]$ to $\tilde{E}(k)$ is injective for all $\gcd(m,\text{char}(k))=1$, where $E(K)[m]$ denotes the $m$-torsion subgroup of $E(K)$. So, we are looking at the compositions
$$E(\mathbb{Q})[m]\hookrightarrow E(\mathbb{Q}_3)[m]\hookrightarrow \tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_3)\quad\text{ for all }3\nmid m$$
$$E(\mathbb{Q})[n]\hookrightarrow E(\mathbb{Q}_5)[n]\hookrightarrow \tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_5)\quad\text{ for all }5\nmid n$$
It seems the best we can say (I think) is that the $3$-torsion-free part of $E(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}}$ injects into $\tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_3)$, and the $5$-torsion-free part of $E(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}}$ injects into $\tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_5)$. This still clearly implies that $E(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}}$ must be of order 2 in this particular case , because $\tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_5)$ is $3$-torsion-free and $\tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_3)$ is $5$-torsion-free; but it seems to me that the reasoning in the block-quoted statement (at least without further explanation) is technically wrong. If $p$ is a prime of good reduction for $E$, then is it true that all of $E(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}}$ injects into $\tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_p)$, or just that $E(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}}[m]$ injects into $\tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_p)$ for any $m$ relatively prime to $p$ (and hence the $p$-torsion-free part of $E(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}}$ injects into $\tilde{E}(\mathbb{F}_p)$)?","['elliptic-curves', 'number-theory']"

Does it relate to the fact that the $n$ -sphere is the most compact shape in $n$ dimensions, or is that merely a coincidence?

I was trying to think of some sort of visually intuitive proof of this fact. (I already know several homotopical proofs), and this is roughly what I came up with: Suppose you have a vector field on a sphere. It's seems reasonable that if it is nonvanishing, all of the integral curves will be circles. (I think that's true? I know either an integral curve is periodic, a point, or a line... and we're assuming it's not a point, and I just feel like you couldn't fit a line in there for some silly reason.) If this is true then there is probably an integral curve with the smallest 'diameter,': a circle divides the sphere into two pieces (not easy to prove, but visually an audience could be convinced), and the 'diameter' is defined to be the smaller of the two different obvious ways one could define the diameter. This curve can't be a point, so it has nonempty 'interior' (again using the Jordan curve theorem, and we pick the 'smaller' interior). Pick a point in the interior and follow it's integral curve. This integral curve has to be contained inside the 'smallest'. Contradiction, since clearly the diameter of this one is less. Obviously there are lots of things that are not at all obvious. But I would be happy if this argument COULD be made rigorous, even with lots of technical details, because then I wouldn't feel bad giving it without the details since it's very visual.","['algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

In fact, the diagonal on the right side does capture every prime except for those that are the second prime of a twin prime pair because $p+3$ skips over $p+2$. However...there ARE some hold-outs. There are primes that do not appear in the main body of the triangle, but DO appear in the right side diagonal despite not being a twin prime. In other words, they appear only twice in the entire triangle while having composite odd neighbors. The first few are $23, 53, 79, 83, 131, 157, \dots$.

I'm supposed to show that the identity component of a matrix group is a subgroup in two steps.  I'm allowed to assume that ""matrix multiplication is a continuous operation"".  First question- what does this mean?  Does this mean multiplying matrices by a fixed matrix is continuous, or multiplying two matrices which vary? In the first step, I'm supposed to prove that if there are continuous paths in the group $G$ from 1 to $A \in G$ and  to $B \in G$ then there is a path in G from $A$ to $AB$. I did this by assuming that matrix multiplication by a fixed matrix was continuous.  I presume that this will get us closure under group operation by concatenating the path from 1 to $A$ with the path from $A$ to $AB$. Second, and where I am stuck, is in proving that if there is a continuous path in $G$ from 1 to $A$ there is also a continuous path from $A^{-1}$ to 1 .

If $T$ is symmetric and $D(T)=H$ then $T$ is self-adjoint . As a corollary, if the above is true then a symmetric and self-adjoint operator must be Hermitian since a symmetric operator defined on all of $H$ must be bounded.

38400,Paradox or Error: On the inclusion of dense subspaces into Hilbert spaces,"the following observations are very simple, but I suppose they contain an error, which I haven't been able to find it so far. Maybe somebody can help how to fix it: Let $H$ be a Hilbert space, $U$ be a dense subspace. Assume we can equip $U$ with another Hilbert space norm by itself. We denote this space by $\mathcal U$, to avoid misunderstandings. We then have the linear inclusion $ i : \mathcal U \rightarrow H$ with image dense in $H$. Assume furthermore, $i$ is bounded. Let us now inspect the dual arrow, which acts on the topological dual spaces:
    $i^\ast : H^\ast \rightarrow \mathcal U^\ast, \;\; w( \cdot) \mapsto w( i \cdot )$ As $i$ is a bounded injection, $i^\ast$ is now a bounded surjection. What is the kernel of $i^\ast$? We have $\ker i^\ast = \{ w \in H^\ast : w(x) = 0, x \in \operatorname{Im} i \}$ But then $\ker i^\ast = (\operatorname{Im} i)^\perp = U^\perp = H^\perp = \{0\}$, so $i^\ast$ is injective. Hence it is an isomorphism. Strange: But if we dualize $i^\ast$ again, we then see $i$ is an isomorphism, too. Furthermore, as $H$ and $\mathcal U$ are Hilbert spaces, we are given (isometric) isomorphisms $H \simeq H^\ast$, $\mathcal U \simeq \mathcal U^\ast$. We can compose these morphisms. Strange: We obtain $\mathcal U \simeq H$, where the injection is in fact an isomorphism. So this eventually means, if we equip any dense subspace of a Hilbert space with a stronger topology, then the injection $i$ as above is an isomorphism. This seems paradoxical, and I suppose there is an error in the above. For example, this implies the injection $H^1(\mathbb R) \rightarrow L^2(\mathbb R)$ is an isomorphism.
