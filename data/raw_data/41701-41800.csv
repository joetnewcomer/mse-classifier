412092,How does the Hahn-Banach theorem implies the existence of weak solution?,"I came across the following question when I read chapter 17 of Hormander's book ""Tha Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators"", and the theorem is Let $a_{jk}(x)$ be Lipschitz continuous in an open set $X\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $a_{ij}=a_{ji}$, and assume that $(\Re a_{ij}(x))$ is positive definite.  Then
$$
\sum_{ij} D_j(a_{jk}D_ku)=f
$$
has a solution $u\in H_{(2)}^{loc}(X)$ for every $f\in L_{loc}^2(X)$ The auther then says if we can show that 
$$
|(f,\phi)|\leq \|M \cdot\sum_{ij}  D_j(\bar{a_{jk}}D_k\phi) \|_{L^2}, \quad \phi\in C_c^{\infty}(X)
$$
for some positive continuous function $M$, then by Hahn-Banach theorem there exists some $g\in L^2$
$$
  (f,\phi)=\left(g,M\cdot\sum_{ij}  D_j(\bar{a_{jk}}D_k\phi)\right)
$$
which inplies that the weak solution is $u=Mg$. what confuses me is how the Hahn-Banach theorem is used here to show the existence of $g$. Thanks for your help","['functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
412096,Product of an increasing and a decreasing function,"I am interested on finding conditions on a function $f(x)$, $x>0$, such that $$g(x)=\dfrac{f(x)}{x^3},$$ is a decreasing function. Unfortunately, the function $f$ in my context is not in closed form but I know that it is increasing, positive, and asymptotically bounded. I would like to provide some general, but interpretable, conditions such that $g$ is a decreasing function. For instance, a general condition would be $$g'(x)<0 \Rightarrow x\dfrac{d}{dx}\log f(x)<3,$$ which, in my opinion, is not very informative . I wonder if there is a better criterion which provides milder or more interpretable conditions on $f$.","['calculus', 'functions']"

412164,Determine the Galois Group of $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)(x^2-5)$,"Determine all the subfields of the splitting fields of this polynomial. I chose this problem because I think to complete it in great detail will be a great study tool for all of the last chapter, as well. (I'm using Dummit & Foote). Can I have help outlining the method? I need to first find the splitting field, correct? Is there a more elegant observation than noting that I can use difference of squares factoring and rewrite the polynomial as $(x- \sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})(x-\sqrt{3})(x+\sqrt{3})(x-\sqrt{5})(x+\sqrt{5})$, where none of $\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}$ are in the field $\mathbb{Q}$? (The problem doesn't say this is the base field, but I'm assuming.) So the splitting field is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$. Is this how you recommend finding the splitting field, i.e. explicitly calculating the roots and ensuring your extension contains them? I wish there were a more theoretical way of doing this that would apply to any polynomial. Now, to find the Galois group, do you exhaustively compute automorphisms and just observe which elements the automorphism fixes in order to find the corresponding fixed field? This seems to get complicated very quickly. Is there some theoretical machinery to aid in this, as well? Once finding the fixed fields are accomplished, from the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory I know there exists a correspondence between the fixed fields and the subfields, so if I find all fixed fields of automorphisms, I will have found all subfields.

412180,one to one and onto problem,"Consinder the function $$f\colon\mathbb N\to \mathbb N\text{ via }f(n)=2n-1.$$ Is function one to one? Is function onto? First of all, I think it is one to one 
because when i put $n=1$, I get $2(1)-1=1$ $n=2$, I get $2(2)-1=3$ $n=3$, I get $2(3)-1=5$ $n=4$, I get $2(4)-1=7$ I get all odd numbers. I dont get even numbers. Therefore, this function is NOT onto. Am I right?? 
What if I get $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\ldots$ whole numbers, then wouldn't the function be onto?? The reason function is one to one is because by using the definition, if $f(n_1)=f(n_2)$ then $n_1=n_2$.  So $2n_1-1=2n_2-1 \Rightarrow n_1=n_2$, therfore it is one to one. That's how I think and I would like to know if I'm understanding the definition of one to one correctly.

412209,Circle Chord Sequence,"This is my first post, so be nice! When I was in my first Geometry class in high school, I asked the teacher the following: Given a circle of radius 2a, find the length of the chord running parallel to the diameter of the circle such that the semicircle cut by the chord is divided into two regions of equivalent area. The teacher looked at me as if he knew the answer but then paused, puzzled, and told me that we should work on it after class.  So we did, and it was at this moment that I was introduced to trigonometry.  Yet we did not find a solution and the problem was filed into the back of my memory for some time.  A year and a half later, at the end of Algebra 2/Trig, the problem re-entered my awareness and I took another crack at it.  After maybe an hour of work I found the solution!  I was so excited that I asked my teacher if I could present it to the class on the second to last day of school, and she consented.  So I presented it, but crap I forgot my notes and I screwed up the work leading to the solution and embarrassed myself in front of everybody.  I cleaned it up after class when I had more time, but by then only the real math enthusiasts were left.  Anyway, that was completely tangential, as I would now like to pose the question that I came here with: Skip to here if you don't care about anything but mathematics: Given a circle of radius 2a, find the sequence of real numbers given by the length of successive iterations of slicing the segment resulting from a chord which runs parallel to the diameter of the circle such that the area of the segment is halved with each successive slice. Oh, and the answer to the first question is something like 0.71... or 0.79..., I have forgotten by now.  Bonus points to the most elegant solution of the first problem.","['geometry', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'euclidean-geometry', 'circles']"

412229,Cover and avoidance properties of chief factors: can we avoid exactly the ones we want?,"If $G$ is a finite solvable group with chief series $1 = G_0 \leq \ldots \leq G_n = G$ (so each $G_i \unlhd G$ and if $G_{i-1} < H < G_i$ then $H$ is not normal in $G$) and $I \subseteq \{ 1,\ldots,n\}$.  Does there exist a subgroup $H \leq G$ such that $G_{i-1} H \geq G_i$ when $i \in I$ and $G_i \cap H \leq G_{i-1}$ when $i \notin I$? In other words, can I choose which chief factors a subgroup covers and avoids? (If so, can we describe how to find such a subgroup? If not, are there easy properties $I$ needs to have, like containing all the Frattini chief factors?) Here are some example sets $I$ that we can use: $I_p = \{ i : [G_i:G_{i-1}] \text{ is divisible by } p \}$, $H$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup $I_{p'} = \{ i : [G_i:G_{i-i}] \text{ is not divisible by } p \}$, $H$ is a Sylow $p$-complement $I_{\pi} = \{ i : [G_i:G_{i-1}] \text{ is a $\pi$-number} \}$, $H$ is a Hall $\pi$-subgroup $I_c = \{ i  : G_i/G_{i-1} \leq Z(G/G_{i-1}) \}$, $H$ is a Sylow system normalizer $I_\Phi = \{ i : G_i/G_{i-1} \leq \Phi(G/G_{i-1}) \}$, then $H$ is a pre-Frattini subgroup Indeed these can almost by used as definitions for the $H$ (there is a technical condition about behaving well with a Sylow system for the last one or two, I think). All of these subgroups exist in every finite soluble group. Do the allowable $I$ at least form a Boolean algebra? $I_c \cup I_\Phi$ is allowable (by Hawkes, though I don't know the details).

412250,Image on Stairs,"I am not a mathematician by any stretch but have this real world problem that I need help with. So imagine a set of steps that have a tread length of 12"" and a riser height of 6"". There are 30 steps in total. Your fifty feet away from the steps and you printed out a large image such as your face. You cut it into strips and apply it to each riser to form a very large portrait from your vantage point. You realize that the edges look pretty jaggy as it moves back 12"" on each step. The solution would be to increase the size of each strip by a certain amount to make the edges of your face line up to create the illusion from your 50' vantage point. I thought it would be a standard percentage from step to step but when I work it out it doesn't work that simply unfortunately. My initial belief was print the first step at say 100%. The second at 106% and the each strip would increase 106% from the previous one all the way up so the edges matched. When I drew it out the image got progressively larger as it went up each step.

$\begin{cases} \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = y^2z^3 - \gamma = 0\\ \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}  = 2xyz^3-2\gamma = 0\\ \frac{\partial F}{\partial z} = 3xy^2z^2 -3\gamma = 0\\ \frac{\partial F}{\partial \gamma} = -x-2y-3z+6 = 0\\ \end{cases}$ After the calculation I get the possible point is $P = (1, 1, 1)$.
So I count the 2nd derivatives : 
$$\left[\begin{array}{ccc}

This should be because od Lebesgue-Radon-Nykodym, so $s$ is singular and $h\in L^1$. I was also wondering how does $\nu$ look like? It should be that $(1+|h(x)|)dx$ is $d\nu$'s  absolutely continuous part with respect to Lebesgue measure and that $|ds(x)|$ is $d\nu$'s singular part (with respect to Lebesgue measure). But can we reconstruct $\nu$ from this?","['measure-theory', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
412505,Recognizing subadditivity,"Let $f: (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ be some continuous function. We say that $f$ is subadditive if the bound 
\begin{align}
f(x+y) \leq f(x) + f(y) \tag{1}
\end{align}
holds. I was attempting to understand a bit better what it means for $f$ to be subadditive by understanding what the condition says about the associated function $g:(0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $g(x) = \frac{f(x)}{x}$ (note that $f$ can be recovered from $g$). One finds that $f$ is subadditive if and only if $g$ satisfies
\begin{align}
\frac{g(x+y) - g(x)}{y} + \frac{g(y+x) - g(y)}{x} \leq 0 \tag{2}
\end{align}
i.e. the sum of the slopes of two particular secants of $g$ is always nonpositive. This gives a bit of intution for subadditivity. For instance, one sees immediately that a sufficient condition for $f$ to be subadditive is that $g$ be (weakly) decreasing (so that both of the above summands are nonpositive). But, not all subadditive $f$ have $g$ decreasing and, in general, this condition on $g$ seems no less confusing than subadditivity.  My vague question is: Can someone ""interpret"" this condition on $g$? Or somehow else shed some light on subadditivity? Roughly, should I be able to tell (as one can for linear functions) whether subadditivity holds by glancing the graph of $f$ or $g$? To stimulate discussion, let me close by pointing out a method of generating interesting examples of subadditive functions. If $x \mapsto \Phi_x$ is a semigroup homomorphism (i.e. $\Phi_{x+y} = \Phi_x \circ \Phi_y$ holds) from $(0,\infty)$ to the isometries of some metric space $(M,d)$, and $p \in M$, then, $f(x) = d(p, \Phi_x(p))$ is a subadditive function. For example, if
$\Phi_x = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos x & - \sin x \\ 
\sin x & \cos x \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
viewed as an isometry of Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $p=(1,0)$, then this construction yields the subadditive function $f(x) = \sqrt{ (\cos x - 1)^2 + \sin^2 x}$. The associated $g$ is not decreasing in this case and, just from looking at the graph , it seems far from obvious that (2) holds.","['graphing-functions', 'algebra-precalculus', 'abstract-algebra']"

412665,Using polynomials as recursions,"I made this observation in my discrete math course a while back.  I explored it further online, so not all the ideas contained are mine alone.  I still am confused about some things, though.  Consider the equation $x^2-x-1=0$ whose positive root is the golden ratio $\phi$.  Rewriting the equation we get $x^2=x+1$, and for nonzero $x$ we can divide to get $x=1+\frac1x$.  Now $x$ is defined recursively in terms of itself, so plugging it back into this defining equation we get $x=1+\frac1{1+\frac1x}$, and by continuing indefinitely we produce a continued fraction which converges exactly to $\phi$.  Returning to the quadratic, we see also that if $x^2=x+1$, then by taking the square root we have $x=\sqrt{x+1}$; since again $x$ is defined recursively in terms of itself we can plug it back into the equation to get $\sqrt{\sqrt{x+1}+1}$ and so on, to produce an infinitely iterated root that also converges to $\phi$. What is this process/idea called where you find a recursion that 'solves itself'?  By that I mean that we had an expression for $x$ in terms of itself, which can be used iteratively to compute $x$.  How can one recognize that iterated roots or fractions can be rewritten as polynomials and vice versa? Also, I find this argument of 'plugging $x$ into itself' to be very ad-hoc and non-rigorous.

$BC([0,1],R)$. I have been advised to use the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem (Take $K$ to be a closed subset of $C[0,1]$.  Then the following are equivalent: $K$ is compact; $K$ is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous). So basically we need to prove that the closure of $F$ is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous.  Can I prove that $F$ is uniformly bounded by saying that the $K$-th derivative is obviously bounded by $M$ for $x$ between $0$ and $1$, so the $(K - 1)$-th derivative must be bounded because it only changes by a finite amount (only achieves at maximum a velocity of $M$) and so must be bounded as well, and then extending this logic all the way to the original $f$? I also don't really know how to go about proving that the function is equicontinuous.  Any help is greatly appreciated!",['analysis']

Thanks for any insights. I also appreciate any references of results that go in this direction. Edit: In case one assumes that $Y$ is second countable , I've come up with the following approach: From a comment of @Martin to this answer I gather that the space of $k$-jets $J^k(X,Y)$ is second countable if $X$ and $Y$ are second countable. A result (on page 2) in this paper implies that if $X$ and $Z$ are second countable, then $C^0(X,Z)$ (endowed with the compact-open topology) is separable . Setting $Z:=J^r(X,Y)$ and using the fact that the $C^k$-topology on $C^k(X,Y)$ is induced by the $k$-jet extension
$$j^k:C^k(X,Y)\to C^0(X,J^k(X,Y))$$
we can deduce that $C^k(X,Y)$ is separable .
A metric space is separable if and only if it's Lindelöf.
Since $C^k(X,Y)$ is a metric space we conclude that it is Lindelöf . Does this approach work, or are there some problems that I'm overlooking?

Then we simply substitute this value to get: $$ \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}{\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{5^n}} = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}{\int_{C}{\frac{(1 + z)^{2n}}{(5z)^{n}}\frac{dz}{z}}} $$ The book then says that if we can show convergence is uniform on the closed curve chosen, then we can switch the order of summation and integration.

Once they show convergence on the unit circle this simply state this: $$ \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}{\binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{5^n}} = \frac{5}{2 \pi i}\int_C{\frac{dz}{3z - 1 - z^2}} $$ Can anyone shed some light on how this equality was deduced?

413007,Convex metric on a continuum.,"I am having troubles with this problem. Translation: A metric $d$ on a continuum is called convex if for any two points $p$ and $q$ of $X$ there is a point $x\in X$ such that $d(p,x)=\frac12d(p,q)=d(q,x)$. Prove that if the metric on $X$ is convex, then the balls are connected, and $X$ is locally connected. Once the balls shown that the balls are connected, the following implication comes for free. My idea is to suppose that there are $x_0\in X$ and $\epsilon_0>0$ such that $B(x_0,\epsilon_0)=\{x\in X:d(x,x_0)<\epsilon_0\}$ is not connected. Then there are $U$ and $V$, open, disjoint, and non-empty, such that $B(x_0,\epsilon_0)=U\cup V$. The next part is complicated to write, but the idea is to construct a Cauchy sequence in $B(x_0,\epsilon_0)$, and since we’re in a compactum it will converge to some element of $X$, which will in fact be in the boundary of $B(x_0,\epsilon_0)$. To do this we suppose without loss of generality that $x_0\in U$. Let $x_1\in V$. Since $d$ is convex there is an $x_2\in X$ such that $d(x_0,x_2)=\frac12d(x_0,x_1)=d(x_1,x_2)$. Then $x_2\in U\cup V$ (since $d(x_0,x_2)<d(x_0,x_1)<\epsilon_0$). If $x_2\in U$, then we look at $x_1\in V$, $x_2\in U$, and there is an $x_3\in X$ such that $d(x_1,x_3)=\frac12d(x_1,x_2)=d(x_2,x_3)$. (Again we see that $x_3\in B(x_0,\epsilon_0)$ and moreover $d(x_0,x_3)<\frac12\epsilon_0$.) If $x_2\in V$, then we look at $x_0\in U$, $x_2\in V$, and there is an $x_3\in X$ such that $d(x_0,x_3)=\frac12d(x_0,x_2)=d(x_2,x_3)$. (Again we see that $x_3\in B(x_0,\epsilon_0)$ and moreover $d(x_0,x_3)<\frac12\epsilon_0$.) I hope that the construction of the sequence $(x_n)$ is understood. According to me one can prove that we will have satisfied the following two conditions: i) $d(x_n,x_{n+1})<\frac1{2^n}\epsilon_0$ for all $n$ (so it will be Cauchy) ii) $d(x_0,x_n)<\frac12\epsilon_0$ for all $n$ Then on the one hand we have $(x_n)\to x$ for some $x\in X$. Then $x\in\operatorname{bdry}B(x_0,\epsilon_0)$. But on the other hand $d(x_0,x)\le d(x_0,x_n)+d(x_n,x)<\frac12\epsilon_0+\frac12\epsilon_0=\epsilon_0$ for each $n\ge k$ for some $k\in \mathbb{N}$. Then $x\in B(x_0,\epsilon_0)$, which is a contradiction. Therefore the open balls are connected, and therefore $X$ is locally connected. I don’t actually know whether this proof is okay or if there is another easier way. I hope you can help. Thank you.

Prueba que si la métrica para X es convexa, entonces las bolas son conexas y entonces X es localmente conexa."" Una vez teniendo lo de que las bolas son conexas, la siguiente implicación viene de regalo.

La siguiente parte es complicada de escribir, pero la idea es construir una sucesión de Cauchy en $B(x_{0},\epsilon _{0})$ y como estamos en un compacto ésta va a converger a algún elemento de X, que de hecho estará en la frontera de $B(x_{0},\epsilon _{0})$.
Para hacer esto, supongamos, sin pérdida de generalidad, que $x_{0}\in U$.
Sea $x_{1}\in V$, como d es convexa existe $x_2\in X$ tal que  $d(x_{0},x_{2})=\frac{1}{2}d(x_{0},x_{1}) =d(x_{1},x_{2})$, entonces (haciendo cuentitas $x_{2}\in B(x_{0},\epsilon _{0})$) entonces $x_{2}\in U\cup V$. Si $x_{2}\in U$ entonces nos fijamos en $x_{1}\in V,x_{2}\in U$ entonces, existe $x_{3}\in X$ talque $d(x_{1},x_{3})=\frac{1}{2}d(x_{1},x_{2}) =d(x_{2},x_{3})$. (de nuevo haciendo cuentas podemos llegar a que $x_{3}\in B(x_{0},\epsilon _{0})$ pero además $d(x_{0}, x_{3})< \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{0}$. Si $x_{2}\in V$ entonces nos fijamos en $x_{0}\in U,x_{2}\in V$ entonces, existe $x_{3}\in X$ talque $d(x_{0},x_{3})=\frac{1}{2}d(x_{0},x_{2}) =d(x_{2},x_{3})$. (de nuevo haciendo cuentas podemos llegar a que $x_{3}\in B(x_{0},\epsilon _{0})$ pero además $d(x_{0}, x_{3})< \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{0}$. Espero, que se entienda cómo va a ser la construcción de la sucesión $(x_{n})$
Según yo, se puede probar que así construida vamos a tener las siguientes dos condiciones: i)$d(x_{n},x_{n+1})< \frac{1}{2^{n}}\epsilon_{0} \forall n$  (por lo tanto va a ser de Cauchy) ii) $d(x_{0},x_{n})< \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0} \forall n$ Entonces, por un lado tenemos que $(x_{n}) \longrightarrow x$ para algún $x\in X$. Entonces $x\in Fr(B(x_{0},\epsilon _{0}))$. 
Pero por otro lado $d(x_{0}, x)\le d(x_{0}, x_{n})+d(x_{n},x)< \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0} + \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}= \epsilon_{0}$  $\forall n\ge k$ para alguna $k\in \mathbb{N}$.
Entonces $x\in B(x_{0},\epsilon _{0})$ lo cual es una contradicción.
Por lo tanto las bolas abiertas son conexas y por lo tanto X es localmente conexo. La verdad no se si esta demostración esté bien o si hay otra forma más sencilla.
Espero me puedan ayudar.

413032,How many $n$-colorings up to rotation using exactly 2 of each color are there on a $2n$-polyhedron?,"I'm a high-school student and I stumbled across a YouTube video explaining how Rubik's cubes work. A Rubik's cube has 6 colors, one for each side, but I started thinking about ways to $n$-color the cube and other $2n$-polyhedra. While researching it I came across group theory, which led me to learn about Burnside's lemma (this is a really deep rabbit hole!). As I understand it, the way that it works is that you first find the cycle index for the group you want to consider, which in our case lets us count all the ways you can permute the faces of the polyhedron. Then it's a straightforward substitution with $n$ = the number of colors to consider. For instance, the cycle index of the cube tells us that if we have n colors, then there are $\frac{1}{3}n^2 + \frac{1}{2}n^3 + \frac{1}{8}n^4 + \frac{1}{24}n^6$ ways to color the cube. So there are $1, 10, 57, 240, ...$ ways to color a cube with $n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...$ colors. I think I understand how to find the cycle index for a few of the 2n-polyhedra, so I know how many ways there are to color all the sides using up to $n$ colors. (I don't know how to find the cycle index for every 2n-polyhedron without considering the graphs one at a time, though; is there a generating function for that?) However, what I'd like to know is how to tell how many ways there are to color a $2n$-polyhedron using $n$ colors, where each color is used exactly twice . Any hints? Where I'm at right now is that it seems like the cycle index would still figure prominently, but now some of the enumerations aren't considered -- basically, every time there is a coloring that uses a color in a frequency other than twice, we want to throw it away. But I can't see how to count in which of the cases a color is used in a frequency other than twice.","['symmetry', 'group-theory', 'polyhedra', 'combinatorics']"

Denote the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$ by $|\cdot|$ and denote $C=\{x\in[0,1]:f'(x)=0\}$ . Note that $C$ is a closed. Using the fact that for every closed subset $K$ of $[0,1]$ , $$|f(K)|\le\int_K|f'(x)|dx,$$ or otherwise, we know that $f(C)$ is closed and $|f(C)|=0$ , so $f(C)$ , and hence $f(C\cap E)$ , are closed and nowhere dense. Note that $[0,1]\setminus C$ is a disjoint union of at most countably many intervals, say $[0,1]\setminus C=\sqcup_n I_n$ . Note that $f|_{\overline{I_n}}$ is homeomorphic, so $f(\overline{I_n}\cap E)$ is closed and nowhere dense. Then by Baire category theorem, $$f(E)=f(C\cap E)\cup\big(\cup_n f(\overline{I_n}\cap E)\big)$$ is nowhere dense. Moreover, I removed another question similar to Q1 in this post, and  started a new post for it. Any hint or suggestion is appreciated. Thanks in advance.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

Since $\mathscr{O}_X = f^{-1} \mathscr{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} A}$, there is a canonical ring homomorphism $\mathscr{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} A} \to f_* \mathscr{O}_X$. Let $\mathscr{J} \subseteq \mathscr{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} A}$ be the preimage of $f_* \mathscr{I} \subseteq f_* \mathscr{O}_X$. Clearly, $\mathscr{J}$ is an ideal sheaf, and moreover $\mathscr{I} = f^{-1} \mathscr{J}$ (as subsheaves of $\mathscr{O}_X$). Question. Is $\mathscr{J}$ quasicoherent? This is certainly true when $X$ is $\operatorname{Spec} A[S^{-1}]$ for some finitely-generated multiplicative set $S$: the question is then a simple matter of commutative algebra. On the other hand, at the level of topological spaces, every closed subset of $X$ (affine or not) can be obtained as the preimage of some closed subset of $\operatorname{Spec} A$, but unfortunately the map from ideal sheaves to closed subsets is not necessarily a bijection.","['quasicoherent-sheaves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

Through the Serre's criterion for affinity, we can know that $H^1(X,\mathcal{F})=0$ then $X$ is affine with some conditions on $X$ and $\mathcal{F}$. I have a question about the proof. In the book , the proof starts with choosing a closed point $x\in X$ and an affine open neighborhood $U$ of X. Then let $\mathcal{M}$ be the sheaf of ideals of $\mathcal{O}_X$ which defines the reduced closed subscheme of $X$ whose underlying space is $\{x\}$, and $\mathcal{J}$ be the sheaf of ideals on $X\setminus U$. With above, the author says, $0 \to \mathcal{MJ} \to \mathcal{J} \to \mathcal{J}/ \mathcal{MJ} \to 0$ is an exact sequence of sheaves. What is the sheaf $\mathcal{MJ}$ means? Actually, I have never seen the notation $\mathcal{FG}$ for two sheaves $\mathcal{F}$, $\mathcal{G}$.

413129,Self-adjoint projections of a C*-algebra as complete lattices?,"In Blackadar's Operator Algebras , there is the following remark after the proposition II.3.3.1 : The projections in a C*-algebra do not form a lattice in general In the answer of this question , it is said that: If you restrict $\leq$ to the set of self-adjoint projections in $A$ , you do get a lattice, which is isomorphic to the lattice of closed subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^2$ .  The supremum of $a$ and $b$ in this lattice is $I$ and the infimum of $a$ and $b$ is $0$ . Does this statement really holds?
And if this is the case, can we also prove that it is a continuous lattice?

413275,How many distinct translates of a (non-admissible) set $\mathcal{H}$ can consist entirely of primes?,"In a recent post , Terence Tao talks about the prime tuples conjecture, and in particular, he asks: ""Suppose one is given a ${k_0}$-tuple ${{\mathcal H} = (h_1,\ldots,h_{k_0})}$ of ${k_0}$ distinct integers for some ${k_0 \geq 1}$, arranged in increasing order. When is it possible to find infinitely many translates ${n + {\mathcal H} =(n+h_1,\ldots,n+h_{k_0})}$ of ${{\mathcal H}}$ which consists entirely of primes?"" To study this, the concept of an admissible set is introduced: a $k_0$-tuple ${\mathcal H}$ is admissible ""if it avoids at least one residue class ${\hbox{ mod } p}$ for each prime ${p}$."" It is pointed out that, since for non-admissible sets ${\mathcal H}$ there exists a prime $p$ such that ${\mathcal H}$ meets every residue class $\hbox{ mod } p$, then every translate of ${\mathcal H}$ must contain a multiple of $p$, and so there can only be a finite number of translates of ${\mathcal H}$ consisting entirely of primes: in particular, each translate consisting of only primes must contain $p$ itself. This seems incredibly restrictive. Given a non-admissible $k_0$-tuple ${\mathcal H}$, just how many translates are there consisting only of primes, and how does this depend on $k_0$? Can there even be more than 1? As an example, the non-admissible $3$-tuple $(0,2,4)$ has only a single translate consisting of primes -- $(3,5,7)$ -- since every third odd number greater than 3 is divisible by 3, and hence not prime. There are plenty of prime triplets, i.e. $3$-tuples of the form $(p, p+2, p+6)$ or $(p,p+4,p+6)$, but both $(0,2,6)$ and $(0,4,6)$ are admissible -- and similarly for prime quadruplets, quintuplets, and sextuplets. I'm thinking about writing up some Mathematica code to go prime-diving, but I wanted to see if there's some simple theory here first that would save time. Edit: The wiki page on prime k-tuples says that ""Some inadmissible k-tuples have more than one all-prime solution"" and gives the smallest example, but doesn't explain how it arrived at this or explains any of the theory behind it, let alone gives estimates on how many there are. This of course just makes the curiosity even worse.","['prime-numbers', 'number-theory']"
