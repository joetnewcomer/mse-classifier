17346,How does one characterize surfaces with constant nonzero Gaussian and mean curvature,"I know that for any surface, the Gaussian curvature $K$ and mean curvature $H$ satisfy the inequality $H^2 \geq K$ , and the sphere is a surface where that inequality becomes an equation. Thus, the sphere has both constant Gaussian and mean curvature. Are there other surfaces whose Gaussian and mean curvatures are constant and nonzero?",['differential-geometry']
17347,limsup and liminf of a sequence of points in a set,"My ways to define/write limsup and liminf of a sequence of points in a set $X$ : They come from what I have understood. If you have other ways of understanding, really appreciate if you can reply here. When $X$ is a complete lattice, then
$$\limsup \, x_n :=  \inf_{n \geq 0}
        \left(\sup_{m \geq n} \, x_m\right)
        = \mathop{\wedge}\limits_{n \geq 0}\left( \mathop{\vee}\limits_{m\
        \geq n} \, x_m\right). $$ When $X$ is a topological space and
also a partially ordered set (can be
strengthened to be complete in some
sense, such as a complete lattice if
needed), then there are different ways to
define/write: (1) $\displaystyle\limsup \, x_n :=  \sup
        \{\text{limit of any subsequence of
        }\{x_n\}\text{ that converges}\}$ (2) $\displaystyle\limsup \, x_n := \lim_{n
        \rightarrow \infty} ( \sup_{m \geq
        n}x_m )$. $\liminf x_n$ is defined similarly. Questions: Are there some conditions on $X$
that can make 2(1) and 2(2) equivalent? Are there some conditions on $X$
that can make 1 and 2(1) equivalent? For example, when $X$ is both a topological space and a complete lattice, I can define limsup in both 1 and 2(1) ways, so when will they agree? Are there other definitions/forms of
limsup of a sequence of points in a
set $X$ possibly with some
structures? Can they be related/shown to be equivalent to the definitions/forms given above? Is 2(1) exactly the specialization from limsup of a
filter base in $X$ to limsup of a sequence of points in $X$:
 $$\limsup \, x_n :=  \sup \cap \{\bar{B}_0 | B_0 \in B  \}$$
 where $B:=\{ \{x_n | n \geq n_0 \} \forall n_0 \in \mathbb{N}  \}$,
 and $\bar{B}_0$ is the closure of $B_0$? When $X$ is a topological space and
ordered, if $\limsup \, x_n =
    \liminf \, x_n$, both of which are defined in the same way as 2(1),
what is the condition for $\limsup
    \, x_n = \liminf \, x_n$ to be the
same as $\lim \, x_n$ defined with
respect to the topology? Thanks and regards! Self Answer to Question 4: As to Question 4, I think it is. $\forall B_0 \in B$, it is a tail sequence of $\{ x_n \}$, so any accumulation point of $B_0$ will be an accumulation point of any other tail sequence, and an accumulation point of the original sequence $\{ x_n \}$. Therefore 
\begin{align*}
\cap \{\bar{B}_0 | B_0 \in B  \} &= \{\text{accumulation point of }\{ x_n \}  \}\\
 &= \{\text{limit of any subsequence of }\{x_n\}\text{ that converges}\}.
\end{align*}
Please correct me if I am wrong. Added Questions: Arturo, really appreciate your reply! It can take me a while to fully understand what you wrote. I think I will probably put the following into a new post if it is not proper of adding questions here given the length of this post. But anyway, here they are: In definition 1, when will $\limsup
    x_n = \liminf x_n$? In definition 2(1), when will
$\limsup x_n = \liminf x_n$? Basically, I would like to know when one can define ""limit"" of a sequence in a set, not solely depending on or even independent of topology.","['order-theory', 'general-topology', 'lattice-orders', 'elementary-set-theory', 'limsup-and-liminf']"
17348,Locally ringed spaces and Riemann surfaces,"Let $X$ and $Y$ be Riemann surfaces, and $\mathscr{O}_X, \mathscr{O}_Y$ be the sheaves of holomorphic functions on $X$ and $Y$ respectively. It is obvious that a holomorphic map $f:X \to Y$ gives rise to a morphism of locally ringed spaces $(X, \mathscr{O}_X) \to (Y, \mathscr{O}_Y)$. I was always under the impression that a morphism of locally ringed spaces also gave rise to a holomorphic map, but I can't for the life of me prove it. I cant see why the induced stalk maps being local homomorphisms forces the topological map to be holomorphic.

17356,Angle for pointing at a certain point in 2d space,"Recently, I have been programming a simple game. Very simple:
There is a tank, and the cannon will aim at whatever position the mouse is at. Now lets talk about the cannon graphic. The cannon graphic points to the north, with 0 rotation. Here are the variables I have for my game, and that might be important factors for solving my problem: Tx = The tank's X position in the world. Ty = The tank's Y position in the world. Mx = The mouse's X position in the world. My = The mouse's Y position in the world. Also, in this programming language, the greater the Y coordinate, the lower you are. And the less the Y coordinate is, the higher you are. So, Y = 0 means the top. My problem is, how do calculate the rotation needed for my cannon graphic to ""point"" to the mouse's position?

Why is it not some other irrational number? My friend is in a fix as to how to answer this in a sensible manner. Could you help us with this?

\limsup \limits_{r \rightarrow 0} \frac{ \eta(\overline{B_r(0)}) }{ \mu(\overline{B_r(0)}) }

Nevertheless, I know there is a canonical topology on the linear space of bounded radon measures, so is probably on the cone of positive (not necessarily bounded) radon measures (Furthermore, I guess the thoughs pass over the linear space of signed Radon measures) Hence, I would like to obtain a good intuition how the definition of derivative of above relates to the canonical definition (if applicable) of derivative on infinite-dimensional vector spaces.

17437,"Existence of closed, surjective map defined in the Stone-Cech compactification","I'm not so sure if my ""solution"" to the following problem is correct. Can you please let me know if is? or what is wrong? I'm new with this stuff so sometimes I get confused with it. Anyway here it is: Suppose $Y$ is an arbitrary compactification of $X$, if $\beta X$ is the Stone-Cech compactification, prove there is a continuous, surjective closed map $g: \beta X \rightarrow Y$ that equals the identity on X. My work: Since $Y$ is a compactification of $X$ then by definition it is a Hausdorff compact space which contains a dense copy of $X$, so we can view $X$ as a subspace of $Y$.
Hence we can consider the inclusion map $i: X \rightarrow Y$. This is certainly continuous so by the universal property of extension there exists a cts extension:$g: \beta X \rightarrow Y$. So all it remains to show is that $g$ is surjective and closed. Now it is closed because $\beta X$ is compact , $Y$ is Hausdorff and any continuous map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is closed. Now to show $g$ is surjective I'm kinda stuck. Here's what I tried. By definition $X$ is dense in $Y$. But $\beta X$ contains $X$ so $\beta X$ is dense in $Y$ as well. Now the continuous image of a dense set is dense hence: $\overline{g(\beta X)} = Y$ But $\beta X$ is compact and the continuous image of a compact set is compact and a compact subset in a Hausdorff space (Y) is closed so $\overline{g(\beta X)} = g(\beta X)$. Thus $g(\beta X) = Y$.",['general-topology']

17440,On the continuation of a polynomial,"This exrcise is from the first section of Marden: Exercise 12. Let the interior of a piecewise regular curve $C$ contain the origin $\cal O$ and be star-shaped with respect to $\cal O$.  If the complex numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$ are given, then $n$ and $b_{m+1}, b_{m+2}, \ldots, b_n$ may be determined so that all of the zeros of $F(z) = 1 + a_1 z + \cdots + a_m z^m + b_{m+1} z^{m+1} + \cdots + b_n z^n$ lie on $C$. Hint: Choose the zeros $\zeta_j$ of $G(z) = z^n F(1/z)$ so that $z_j = 1/\zeta_j$ are points of $C$ and so that the Newton-Girard formulas $s_k + s_{k-1} a_1 + \cdots + k a_k = 0$ are satisfied by the sums $s_r$ of the $r^{\text{th}}$ powers of the $\zeta_j$. I understand how the requirements of the hint will imply the result, but I do not know how to establish them.  Indeed, if we can satisfy those requirements, then the remaining $b_j$ will be determined by the further Newton-Girard formulas. This is a generalization of the previous problem in the book: Exercise 11: If $F(z) = 1 + a_1 z + b_2 z^2 + \cdots + b_n z^n$, the quantities $n, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ may be so determined so that all the zeros of F lie on the unit circle. The solution to this is simpler: we choose $n > -a_1$ and values $\zeta_1, \ldots, \zeta_n$ on the unit circle with centroid $-a_1/n$.  Viète's formulas tell us that these are the zeros of a polynomial $z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + b_2 z^{n-2} + \cdots + b_n = z^n F(1/z)$, so that $1/\zeta_j$ are the zeros of $F(z)$ and lie on the unit circle. My problem with Exercise 12 lies in ensuring the Newton-Girard formulas are satisfied; it is not as simple as choosing a centroid, and I can't see a way to do it even for the case when $C$ is the unit circle.  How do I know that a solution exists here?  Can I extend this to the general case, or is a separate argument needed? Also, how do I center formulas?

17460,Connectedness of sets in the plane with rational coordinates and at least one irrational,"Can someone please let me know if my solution is correct: Define: 1) Let $A = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{2}: \text{all coordinates of x are rational} \}$. Show that

Enderton chooses to construct the reals with left sides of Dedekind cuts. His definition is $y$ is a Dedekind cut if $\emptyset\neq y\neq\mathbb{Q}$, $y$ has no largest member, and $y$ is downward closed, i.e., $q\in y\wedge r<q\implies r\in y$. The following, question 19 of chapter 5 has me a bit baffled. Assume that $p$ is a positive rational number. Show that for any real number $x$ there is some rational $q$ in $x$ such that $p+q\not\in x$. I have this intuitive argument in my head. I guess I want to take $q\in x$, preferably closer to the right in $x$ on the rational line than not, and add it to $p$. If $p+q\not\in x$, then I am done. Otherwise, since $x$ has no greatest element, I can find $q'\in x$ such that $q'>q$, and add it to $p$ until I finally get a $q$ that pushes $p+q$ out of $x$, supposing of course that this process eventually ends. But this is horribly informal, and I have very little experience with analysis, and can't see a way to formalize it (if this is even the correct approach.)

You need to solve this problem for $0 \leq X \leq 2,147,483,647$ . Examples: $10 \Rightarrow 1$ $25 \Rightarrow 2$ $3 \Rightarrow 0$ $0 \Rightarrow 1$ $1 \Rightarrow 1$ In response to my original question about optimizing this for F#, I got the following response which I'm unable to confirm solves the given problem correctly. Source: StackOverflow answer by Alexandre C. Again, the number of integer solutions
  of $x^2 + y^2 = k$ is four times the
  number of prime divisors of $k$ which

  gives the number of solutions is easy:
  compute prime numbers up to $46341$ once
  and for all. Given $k$ , compute the prime divisors of $k$ by using the above list (test up to $\sqrt{k}$ ). Count the ones which are
  equal to $1 \bmod 4$ , and sum. Multiply
  answer by $4$ . When I go through this algorithm for $25$ , I get $8$ which is not correct. For each prime factor (pf) of $25$ ( $5$ , $5$ are prime factors of $25$ ) if pf % $4$ = $1$ (true for both $5$ 's), add $1$ to count return $4$ * count (count would be $2$ here).

Given $R_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{n!}\int_{0}^{x}f^{n+1}(t)(x-t)^{n}dt$, find out why $R_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{(n+1)!}f^{n+1}(c)x^{n+1}$ for some $c\in [0,x]$ According to FTC, $\int_{0}^{x}f'(t)dt = f(x) - f(0)$ Also, according to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a $c$ such that $f'(c)(x-0)=f(x)-f(0)$ so $\int_{0}^{x}f'(t)dt = f'(c)(x-0)$ finding the derivative of both sides with respect to $x$: $f'(x) = f'(c)$ so $f^{n+1}(x) = f^{n+1}(c)$ Going back to the integral form of the remainder: $R_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{n!}\int_{0}^{x}f^{n+1}(t)(x-t)^{n}dt$, I replace $f^{n+1}(x)$ with $f^{n+1}(c)$ (This is the step I am most unsure of) Since $f'(c)$ is a constant, I pull it out of the integral and integrate what's left under the integral, giving me $R_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{(n+1)!}f^{n+1}(c)x^{n+1}$ for some $c\in [0,x]$ If this is right, then does it mean that $f'(c)$ is the average value of $f'(x)$  from $0$ to $x$?

On average, what test will the first failure be seen at?  Perhaps it is $(9/10)^n$ < 5/10?  What value of n do we reach a 50% chance of failure? Five tries is 59% chance of success, six tries 53%, and seven tries is 48%. Therefore, on average I think we will fail most likely on the seventh trial.

17638,Defining the determinant of linear transformations as multilinear alternating form,"Here is what our professor showed us in our linear algebra class to introduce the idea of determinants: Suppose we have an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$. Then we can create a function from $V^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$ called $vol$ (for ""volume"") satisfying these properties: $vol$ is multilinear $vol$ is alternating (i.e. if any two of $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ are the same, then $vol(v_1, \ldots, v_n) = 0$) From these two properties, we can see that if $e_1, \ldots, e_n$ is a basis of $V$, then the $vol$ function is completely defined by the value $vol(e_1, \ldots, e_n)$. Thus if $T$ is a linear operator on $V$, the ratio: $\dfrac{vol(Te_1, \ldots, Te_n)}{vol(e_1, \ldots, e_n)}$ is the same for any (multilinear and alternating) $vol$ function. However, I am having trouble understanding why the ratio is also independent of the basis $e_1, \ldots, e_n$. This is what I am asking for help with. I can see that this invariance implies that intuitively, every $n$-parallelotope is stretched by the same amount by the operator $T$. (Our professor then defined the determinant of $T$ as that ratio.)",['linear-algebra']
17643,"How can one prove that the union of two finite sets is again finite, without the use of arithmetic?","The notion that the union of two finite sets is again finite is something I took as intuitively true for quite a while. A proof using arithmetic is relatively straight forward. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are finite sets, so let $m=|A|$ and $n=|B|$. Now $A\cup B=A\cup(B-A)$, and since $B-A$ is a subset of a finite set, it is also finite (I have already seen this statement proven), so let $k=|B-A|$. Then $|A\cup B|=m+k=m+_\omega k\in\omega$, so $A\cup B\approx m+_\omega k$, and thus finite. I've read that it is possible to prove this without any use of arithmetic, but I don't quite see how, as arithmetic seems too essential in showing a set is equinumerous to a natural number. Does anyone have a reference to or a reproduction of such a proof?, I'm curious to see. Thank you. Edit: I was unaware of other definitions of what it means to be finite. I consider a set $A$ finite if there is a bijection $f\colon A\to n$ for some natural number $n$. For arithmetic, I'm trying to refrain from using cardinal arithmetic or the arithmetic of natural numbers, so no $+_\omega$, as was used in the other proof I gave. Also, my definition of natural number is the recursive definition that $0=\emptyset$, and $n^+=n\cup\{n\}$.",['elementary-set-theory']

17650,What is the probability that the boy is telling the truth?,"My professor and I have came to a disagreement. My problem is with question number 8. I am pretty sure that you have to use the Bayes'thm for the question. I have tried ONCE to convince him, but regrettably, I have failed. Here is the question(s). I have included the previous questions because some of the information (from previous questions) was used to solve the question 8. start For questions 5 and 6 use the following information: 
Diabetes - physicians recommend that children with type-1 diabetes keep up with insulin shots to minimize the chance of long-term complications. in addition, some diabetes researchers have observed that growth rate of weight during adolescence among diabetic patients is affected by level of compliance with insulin therapy. suppose 12 year old type-1 diabetic boys who comply with their insulin shots have a weight gain over 1 year that is normal distributed, with mean=12 lbs and variance =12 lbs. Q5) what is the probability that compliant type-1 diabetic 12 year old boys will gain at least 15 pounds over 1 year? no continuity correction. Q6) repeat problem #5 but now use the continuity correction (unit of measure is one pound). Q7) Conversely, 12 year old type-1 diabetic boys who do not take their insulin shots (non compliant) have a weight gain over 1 year that is normally distributed with a mean of 8 pounds and a variance of 12 pounds. what is the probability that these non compliant boys will gain at least 15 pounds over 1 year? no continuity correction. Q8) for the following problem, notice how the continuity correction is already built into the question: it is generally assumed that 75% of type-1 diabetics comply with their insulin regimen. suppose that a 12 year old type-1 diabetic boy comes to clinic and shows a 5lb weight gain over 1 year. (actually because of measurement error, assume this is an actual weight gain from 4.5 to 5.5 lbs). the boy claims to be taking his insulin medication. what is the probability that he is telling the truth? end I will jump right into the question. The question asked what is the P(he is telling the truth) i.e. pr(taking medication | weight gain of 5lbs). To me, this is unmistakably conditional. find P(A|B) where 
A= taking medication
B= weight gain of 5lbs. Bayes' thm states... 
P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B) Find P(B|A) i.e. what is the probability that he gains weight given he is taking med? Given: mu=12 theta= root 12. Using the continuity correction... area: min to 5.5 z = (x-mu)/theta = (5.5-12)/root 12 = -1.88 <-> A1 = 0.0301 area: min to 4.5 z = (x-mu)/theta = (4.5-12)/root 12 = -2.17 <-> A2 = 0.0150 A1-A2=0.0151 P(B|A)=0.0151* Find P(A) i.e. what is the probability that he is taking med. Given: In question 8, this was given as 75% or 0.75. Find P(B) i.e. what is the probability that he gains weight of 5lbs? Bayes' thm also states... 
P(B) = P(A int B)+(not A int B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A) i.e. P(weight gain given taking med) + P(weight gain given not taking med) We already found P(weight gain given taking med) = 0.0151* so find P(weight gain given not taking med) Given:mu=8 theta=root 12. Using the continuity correction... area: min to 5.5 z = (x-mu)/theta = (5.5-8)/root 12 = -0.72 <-> A1 = 0.2358 area: min to 4.5 z = (x-mu)/theta = (4.5-8)/root 12 = -1.01 <-> A2 = 0.1562 A1-A2=0.0796 so, P(B) = 0.0151+0.0796 Putting P(B|A), P(A), and P(B) together... P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B) = (0.0151)(0.75)/(0.0151+0.0796) = 0.1196 = 11.96% The following is what my professor said about the question: start Jeff –
     As worded, it is not a conditional probability problem, therefore you do not use posterior probability.  I strongly believe that the correct answer is the area from min to 5.5 (answer is then 0.0301).  However most students found the area from 4.5 to 5.5 (answer is 0.015) because I mentioned the continuity correction and they were confused so I let this answer stand.  In reality, from min to 5.5 would be non-compliance.  In fact and specific number, even if compliant (e.g., Pr(X = 17)) would be a SMALL number.  Thus the probability really should be 5 or less or Min to 5.5 with the continuity correction. end What I think he said was to find the area under the normal distribution curve (as in question 5) from min to 5.5, but that could not possibly be the final answer because the area under the curve is the probability that the boy gains 5lbs., assuming that he is compliant. I went to his office hour and asked him to explain himself. Unfortunately, I did not understand what he was saying. I feel like I just took a crazy pill. I don't see any logical mistakes in my part. If there is any algebraic mistakes that I've made, please let me know. Thank you! my best,

17892,Question about generalizing Schwarz Reflection,"You can use the proof of the Schwarz reflection principle to show that if $D$ is a domain in the complex plane, where $D^+$ denotes the subset of D above the real line, and $D^-$ the subset below, if $f:D\to C$ which is analytic on $D^+$ and $D^-$, and continuous on $D$, then $f$ is analytic on $D$. I want to generalize this as follows: Let $D$ be a domain in the complex plane, and $D'$ an open dense subset of $D$.  If $f$ is a function analytic on $D'$, and continuous on $D$, then $f$ is analytic on $D$. The proof of the Schwarz reflection principle uses integration along arbitrary triangles, and since the intersection of a triangle with the real line is really simple, you can ""cut the real line out"" so to speak when you are taking the integral.

We didn't manage to get through however, because we couldn't find a reason why $A$ actually had to be square in that case -- it seemed to me that it would just be $BA=I$ where $I$ is $m$ by $m$. So in both cases, we would have an Identity matrix, but of different dimensions (sounds strange, but as far as I recall, as long as the product yields an Identity, $B$ counts as an inverse, even if dimensions vary depending on whether you multiply it from left or right).

I'm currently self-studying complex analysis using the book by Stein & Shakarchi, and this is one of the exercises (p.67, Q14) that I have no idea where to start. Suppose $f$ is holomorphic in an open set $\Omega$ that contains the closed unit disc, except for a pole at $z_0$ on the unit circle. Show that if $f$ has the power series expansion $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ in the open unit disc, then $\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}} = z_0$. If the limit is taking on $|\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}|$ and assume the limit exists, by the radius of convergence we know that the answer is $1$. But what can we say about the limit of the coefficient ratio, which is a pure complex number? I've tried to expand the limit directly by definition, with no luck.

I'm interested in answers to either of the following two questions: Is there a name for such $f$ that do preserve units through preimages? If not, is there a class of maps broadly recognized as useful that enjoy this property? I'm actually only interested in the case of a surjection $R \twoheadrightarrow R_0$ whose kernel is an ideal $I$ satisfying $I^2 = 0$ (i.e., a square-zero extension of $R_0$ by $I$).

18041,When can we exchange order of two limits?,"My questions are about a sequence or function with several variables. I vaguely remember some while ago one
of my teachers said taking limits of
a sequence or function with respect to
different variables is not
exchangeable everywhere, i.e.
$$ \lim_n \lim_m a_{n,m} \neq \lim_m \lim_n a_{n,m}, \quad \lim_x \lim_y f(x,y) \neq \lim_y \lim_x f(x,y).$$

question is what are the cases or
examples when one can exchange the
order of taking limits and when one
cannot, to your knowledge? I would
like to collect the cases together,
and be aware of their difference and
avoid making mistakes. If you could
provide some general guidelines, that
will be even nicer! To give you an example of what I am
asking about, this is a question that
confuses me: Assume $f: [0, \infty)
   \rightarrow (0, \infty)$ is a
function, satisfying $$
   \int_0^{\infty} x f(x) \, dx < \infty.
   $$ Determine the convergence of this
series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
   \int_n^{\infty} f(x) dx$. The answer I saw is to exchange the
order of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}$ and
$\int_n^{\infty}$ as follows: $$
   \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \int_n^{\infty}
   f(x) dx
   = \int_1^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\lfloor x \rfloor}  f(n) dx \leq
   \int_1^{\infty} \lfloor x \rfloor 
   f(x) dx $$ where $\lfloor x \rfloor$
is the greatest integer less than
$x$. In this way, the answer proves the series converges. I was wondering why the two steps are valid? Is there some special meaning of the first equality? Because it looks similar to the tail sum formula for expectation of a random variable $X$ with possible values $\{ 0,1,2,...,n\}$: $$\sum_{i=0}^n i P(X=i) = \sum_{i=0}^n P(X\geq i).$$ The formula is from Page 171 of Probability by Jim Pitman, 1993 .

Given w and h , find x and y . Now things get very difficult to keep drawing graphically, to explain my attempts so far. But if i call the length of the line segment common to both triangles M : then: M = w∙sin(t1) Now i can focus on the other triangle, which i'll call O - x - M : and use trig to break it down, giving: x = M∙sin(t1)

18074,Measurable functions with values in Banach spaces,"My question refers to functions with values in Banach spaces and under what conditions the limit of a sequence of measurable functions is also measurable. But first, let me recall some well-known results from real analysis. Let $(X,\mathcal{F})$ be a measurable space, $\bar{\mathbb{R}}$ the extended real line, and $\mathcal{B}(\bar{\mathbb{R}})$ the standard Borel $\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets of $\bar{\mathbb{R}}$. (1) If a sequence of measurable functions $f_n:(X,\mathcal{F})\rightarrow(\bar{\mathbb{R}},\mathcal{B}(\bar{\mathbb{R}}))$ converges to a function $f$ pointwise in $X$, then $f$ is also measurable w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{B}(\bar{\mathbb{R}})$. (See, e.g., Rudin, Real and Complex Analysis, Theorem 1.14.) (2) This can be generalized to the case of a complete measure space $(X,\mathcal{F},\mu)$ and convergence of $f_n$ to $f$ pointwise-$\mu$-a.e. in $X$. (This is stated without proof in Hunter and Nachtergaele, Applied Analysis, Theorem 12.24. Can anyone point to a proof of this, or is it trivial?) Dudley (Real Analysis and Probability, Theorem 4.2.2) generalizes part (1) above to functions with values in metric spaces. Therefore (1) also holds for functions with values in a Banach space $(Y,\Vert\cdot\Vert)$, with corresponding Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(Y)$. My question is: can part (2) be also generalized? In other words, does the following result hold: Let $(X,\mathcal{F},\mu)$ be a complete measure space and $(Y,\Vert\cdot\Vert)$ be a Banach space. Let $f_n:(X,\mathcal{F})\rightarrow(Y,\mathcal{B}(Y))$  be a sequence of measurable functions that converges to a function $f$ pointwise-$\mu$-a.e. in $X$ (i.e., $\Vert f_n(x) - f(x)\Vert \rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, for $x$ $\mu$-a.e. in $X$), then $f$ is also measurable w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{B}(Y)$. Note, I use ""measurable"" in the standard sense: if $U\in\mathcal{B}(Y)$ then $f^{-1}(U)\in\mathcal{F}$. It seems to me that the result should hold but I haven't been able to find a proof in the standard references. Is it trivial? Also, why should the measure space $(X,\mathcal{F},\mu)$ be complete? What fails if it is not complete. Finally, if the result holds, does this mean that standard measurability is equivalent to so-called strong or Bochner measurability?
