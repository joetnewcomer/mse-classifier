41579,"Is the cardinality of the set of rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$ odd?","Let $\mathbb{Q}$ be the set of unique rational numbers of the form $m/n$ where $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Define the following two sets: $$\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}&=\{m/n\ \vert\ m/n \in \mathbb{Q},\ |m|>n\}\\
\mathcal{B}&=\{m/n\ \vert\ m/n \in \mathbb{Q},\ |m|<n,\ m\neq 0\}
\end{align}$$ Now, $f:\ \mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B},\ f(x)=1/x$ is bijective and so, the cardinality of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are the same. Denote $\kappa=\#\mathcal{A}$, where $\#$ denotes cardinality of the set. Now we can write $\mathbb{Q}=\mathcal{A}\cup\mathcal{B}\cup\{0,1,-1\}$. Hence, $$\begin{align}
\#\mathbb{Q}&=\#\mathcal{A}+\#\mathcal{B}+\#\{0,1,-1\}\\
&=\kappa+\kappa+3\\
&=2(\kappa+1)+1

41586,Proving $rank(\wp(x)) = rank(x)^+$,"Enderton defines the rank of a set $A$ to be the least ordinal $\alpha$ such that $A \subseteq V_{\alpha}$ (equivalently, $A \in V_{\alpha^+}$). He the derives the following identity: $rank(A) = \bigcup \{ (rank(x))^+ : x \in A \}$ for all sets $A$. In Exercise 30 of Chapter 7, the reader is asked to prove several identities involving rank. For instance, that $rank\{a,b\} = max(rank(a),rank(b))^+$. I am having trouble proving the second identity, that $rank(\wp(x)) = rank(x)^+$ for all sets $x$. I am not sure whether I am missing some elementary identity that would let me prove the identity, or whether I am misunderstanding the definition of rank. Clearly, $z \in rank(\wp(x)) \Leftrightarrow (\exists y)(y \subseteq x \wedge (z \in rank(y) \vee z = rank(y))$. On the other hand $z \in (rank(x))^+ \Leftrightarrow (\exists y)(y \in x \wedge z \in (rank(y))^+) \vee z = rank(x)$.

41591,standard symbol for a continuous function on some range,"Sorry for what must be a very simple question, but Internet searches have failed me. Is there a standard way to represent ""continuous on some range""? For instance, if I want to say $g^{\prime}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ , is there a way to represent the English words ""is continouus on"" by some standard symbol? I'm not looking for a definition of continuity, merely a standard symbol that represents the idea typographically. [ Edit, 2011.05.27 :] I've been asked to be more precise about the function. Actually, this example was taken from the first part of a published statement of the Substitution Rule for definite integrals, which I have been trying to put tersely on a flashcard using TeX. The full entry (James Stewart, Essential Calculus [N.p: Thomson, 2007] p.239 [Sec. 4.5]) reads: If $g^{\prime}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $f$ is continuous on the range of $u=g(x)$, then $$\int_a^bf\left(g(x)\right)g^{\prime}(x)~dx=\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)}f(u)~du$$ It's quite true that ""range"" appears in reference not to the interval $[a,b]$ but rather to $g(x)$. So I should further ask: is there a way to represent ""continuous on the range"" that is different from the representation ""continuous on the interval"", described by one of the commenters? Really, as a philologist, I am boundlessly impressed at the typographical creativity of mathematicians and was sorry not to find a ready-made symbol anywhere for ""continuous"". Though I see that the notion of continuity is closely connected to notions of interval and boundedness.","['terminology', 'functions']"

Let $\Omega^-$ be the reflection of $\Omega^+$ across the real axis. Take $F(z) = f(z)$ if $z \in \Omega^+$ and $F(z) = f(\overline{z})$ is $z \in \Omega^-$. We can extend $F$ continuously to $I$. Why isn't the function $F$ holomorphic on $\Omega^+ \cup I \cup \Omega^-$? I think there's some detail of a proof that I overlooked.

I have looked into the binomial coefficient, $\displaystyle \frac {n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, but this would solve for the number of combinations if the containers have the same maximums, not varying maximums. Generating functions can solve for combinations with constraints, but what about a formula that could be plugged in straight away so that you can find just the answer to the single coefficient and total that you are looking for; not all the possible coefficients and all the possible totals for those sets. I am having trouble understanding how this can be achieved using generating functions or any other method. Can you draw a formula to solve the number of combinations by knowing the following: the number of sets and their maximums, and the total number that can be divided among them?

I have been able to prove 1), by showing that $Y$ is a non-cyclic subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$ and therefore is dense (a well-known result which I can prove too). 2) had a hint attached: Hint : Start by proving that $0$ is in the closure of $X \backslash \{0\}$ I was able to prove this too: I took $Z = \{ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} b_k a^k / \forall k, b_k \in \{0, 1\} \}$. We have $\forall z \in Z, 0 \leq z \leq \frac{a^n - 1}{a-1} < \frac{a^n}{a-1}$. $Z$ has $2^n$ elements, so if we cut $[ 0, \frac{a^n}{a-1} )$ in the $2^n - 1$ intervals $I_k = [ \frac{(a/2)^n}{a-1} \times k, \frac{(a/2)^n}{a-1} \times (k+1) )$, then there is a $k$ such that $I_k \cap Z = \{z_1, z_2\}$ with $z_1 \neq z_2$. Therefore, $| z_1 - z_2 | \in X \cap [0, \frac{(a/2)^n}{a-1})$. Since $0 < a < 2$, $(\frac{a}{2})^n \rightarrow 0$ and we have that X is dense around 0. But now I'm stuck.

41807,"If Monty Hall doesn't know where the prize is, should the contestant still switch doors, after Monty opens one door and unveiss a goat?","The other day I was asked a variation of the Monty Hall Problem . The answer of the original question is, of course, $ 66\% $ in favor of changing doors, but this is based on the fact that the game show host knows where the prize is. Suppose Monty does not know where the prize is, and after you  pick, he opens one of the other two doors and it happens to be a goat.
Is it still better to change doors when he asks? I believe it is. (After all it still leaves us with two chances instead of one.) But some of my friends think otherwise. We are not mathematicians, just a couple of riddle-likers, so we are not sure of the correct answer. So I thought to post it here. Edit What are your thoughts on the following on Wikipedia ? This quotation  seems to support my answer. Morgan et al. (1991) and Gillman (1992) both show a more general solution where the car is (uniformly) randomly placed but the host is not constrained to pick uniformly randomly if the player has initially selected the car, which is how they both interpret the well known statement of the problem in Parade despite the author's disclaimers. Both changed the wording of the Parade version to emphasize that point when they restated the problem. They consider a scenario where the host chooses between revealing two goats with a preference expressed as a probability q, having a value between 0 and 1. If the host picks randomly q would be 1/2 and switching wins with probability 2/3 regardless of which door the host opens. If the player picks Door 1 and the host's preference for Door 3 is q, then in the case where the host opens Door 3 switching wins with probability 1/3 if the car is behind Door 2 and loses with probability (1/3)q if the car is behind Door 1. The conditional probability of winning by switching given the host opens Door 3 is therefore (1/3)/(1/3 + (1/3)q) which simplifies to 1/(1+q). Since q can vary between 0 and 1 this conditional probability can vary between 1/2 and 1. This means even without constraining the host to pick randomly if the player initially selects the car, the player is never worse off switching. However, it is important to note that neither source suggests the player knows what the value of q is, so the player cannot attribute a probability other than the 2/3 that vos Savant assumed was implicit.","['monty-hall', 'probability']"

41820,Deducing the Definition of the Directional Derivative,"I want to show that if a map $f$, defined on an open subset $X$ of a Banach space $E$ to another Banach space $Y$, is differentiable at a point $x_0 \in X$ then the directional derivative with respect to a nonzero vector $v \in E$ of $f$ at $x_0$ also exists. For this purpose, I will not assume the definition of the directional derivative but infer it from the consequences of the hypotheses above. There are two basic questions about this I would like to ask: Is my argument sound and is there a more concise argument that lead to the same conclusions? Now, assuming the above hypotheses, since $X$ is open we can take a sufficiently small $t$ such that $x_0 + tv$ lies in $X$. That is, there exists $\epsilon >0$ such that $x_0 + tv \in X$ for $|t| < \epsilon$. This means that the function
$$
g(t) = f(x_0 + tv)
$$
is defined on a neighborhood of $x_0$ Denote the derivative of $f$ at $x_0$ by $\partial f(x_0)$. Then, there exists a continuous map $r:X \rightarrow F$ such that $r(x_0) = 0$ and $$
f(x) = f(x_0) + \partial f(x_0)(x - x_0) + r(x)||x - x_0||
$$ Then, $$
g(t) = f(x_0 + tv)
$$ $$
= f(x_0) + \partial f(x_0)( (x_0 + tv) - x_0) + r(x_0 + tv)||(x + tv) - x_0||
$$ $$
= f(x_0) +\partial f(x_0)(tv) + r(x_0 +tv)||tv||
$$ By homogeneity of the norm and linearity of the derivative, it follows that $$
f(x_0 + tv) = f(x_0) + t \partial f(x_0)(v) + |t|r(x_0 + tv)||v||
$$ From algebraic manipluation, it follows that $$
\frac{f(x_0 + tv) - f(x_0)}{t} - \partial f(x_0)(v) = \frac{|t|}{t} ||v||r(x_0 + tv)
$$ Note that as $t \rightarrow 0$ the right hand side of the equation approaches $0$ since $\frac{|t|}{t}||v|| = Â±||v||$ is constant and $$
\lim_{t \to 0} \; r(x_0 + tv) = r(x_0) = 0
$$ where the first equality follows from the continuity of $r$ and the last follows from differentiability of $f$ as noted above. Therefore, $$
\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + tv) - f(x_0)}{t} = \partial f(x_0)(v) = D_v f(x_0)

41856,Drawing a thickened MÃ¶bius strip in Mathematica,"I would like to have Mathematica plot a ""thickened MÃ¶bius strip"", i.e. a torus with square cross section that is given a one-half twist. Ideally, I would like this thickened MÃ¶bius strip to be transparent with a (non-thickened) solid MÃ¶bius strip sitting at its center; here is the best approximation I could draw by hand of what I want: My motivation here is that I want to use the thickened MÃ¶bius strip a visual representation of a line bundle over $E$, where $E$ is the MÃ¶bius strip; that's why I'd like the MÃ¶bius strip at the center to be visible.

Modeling my line bundle as $$E\oplus E=\mathbb{R}^3/\langle (t,x,y)\mapsto(t+2\pi,-x,-y)\rangle,$$

$$F\left(\overline{(t,0,0)}\right)=(R\cos(t),R\sin(t),0)$$

41884,Is there any (nontrivial) constructible rational angle?,"Yesterday, I talked with a friend about a problem where the solution would be an angle of $2$ radians (about $114.6Â°$). Then somehow the question arose whether such an angle would be constructible (with straight edge and compass), and it looks like no - but I had not suddenly an idea on how to prove it either way. The ""easily"" constructible angles (e.g. the ones for which I would know how to construct them without long thinking) are some rational multiples of $\pi$: We know that we can half each angle, and also construct sums and differences of angles, and we have angles of $\frac\pi3$ and $\frac\pi2$ to start with. (Then there are some more from some constructible regular polygons). This is enough to approximate any angle, but does not really help to construct any rational (or even algebraic) angles (with the exception of the trivial angle $0$), since approximation is not a valid operation in constructive geometry. Wikipedia says : [...] The angles that are constructible form an abelian group under
  addition modulo $2\pi$ ([...]). The angles that are constructible are
  exactly those whose tangent (or equivalently, sine or cosine) is
  constructible as a number. [...] It looks like I don't know enough about these functions to utilize this information. The only angles of finite order that may be constructed starting
  with two points are those whose order is either a power of two,
  or a product of a power of two and a set of distinct Fermat primes. Okay, these are the mentioned rational multiples of $\pi$. In addition there is a dense set of constructible angles of infinite order. All rational angles are angles of infinite order, thus if any would be constructible, it would be in this category. And of course, if we had any rational angle, we would get quite a lot other ones from halving and addition. My question: Is there any rational angle $\alpha \in \mathbb Q \setminus\{0\}$ which is constructible, or is there a proof that no such angle exists?

So is there a general equation that can describe a regular polygon (in the 2D Cartesian plane?), given the number of sides required? Using the Wolfram Alpha site, this input gave an almost-square: PolarPlot(0.75 + ArcSin(Sin(2x+Pi/2))/(Sin(2x+Pi/2)*(Pi/4))) (x from 0 to 2Pi) This input gave an almost-octagon: PolarPlot(0.75 + ArcSin(Sin(4x+Pi/2))/(Sin(4x+Pi/2)*Pi^2)) (x from 0 to 2Pi) The idea is that as the number of sides in a regular polygon goes to infinity, the regular polygon approaches a circle. Since a circle can be described by an equation, can a regular polygon be described by one too? For our purposes, this is a regular convex polygon (triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon and so on). It can be assumed that the centre of the regular polygon is at the origin $(0,0)$, and the radius is $1$ unit. If there's no such equation, can the non-existence be proven?

42001,Is this functional weakly continuous?,"Take a $C^1$ function $G \colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ and define a functional $$\mathcal{G}(u)=\int_0^1G(u(t))\, dt, \quad u \in H^1(0, 1).$$ We then have $\mathcal{G}\in C^1\big(H^1(0, 1)\to \mathbb{R}\big)$. Now, I would like to apply Weierstrass's theorem to this functional, and so I need to show that it is weakly lower semicontinuous. Question 1 Is it true? Some course notes I'm reading act as if $\mathcal{G}$ were weakly continuous , because they claim the differential $$\mathcal{G}' \colon H^1(0, 1) \to \big[ H^1(0, 1) \big] ' $$ is weak-strong continuous. (This trivially implies the claim). To show that, they first compute $$\langle \mathcal{G}'(u), v \rangle = \int_0^1 G'(u)v\, dt,$$ which is clear to me, and then factor the mapping $$u \in H^1 \mapsto \mathcal{G}'(u) \in \big[ H^1 \big]'$$ as $$u \in H^1 \mapsto u \in L^\infty \mapsto G'\circ u \in L^\infty \mapsto \mathcal{G}'(u) \in \big[ H^1 \big]';$$ then, since the first embedding is compact (so they say) and the other arrows are continuous, the whole mapping is weak-strong continuous.

  $H^1(0, 1) \hookrightarrow L^\infty(0, 1)$ is not compact. Am I wrong?","['hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

42005,precise official definition of a cell complex and CW-complex,"I would be very grateful If someone could state a precise definition (direct one and inductive one) of a cell complex and CW-complex , since my intuition is telling that some restriction is missing and also, the definitions from several books seem to be very different. Conciseness is much desired, since everything seems so complicated. 1) DEFINITIONS From Introduction to Topological Manifolds (J. M. Lee) and from Algebraic Topology (T. tom Dieck): These definitions are so complicated, that I can't really see what's going on. Let $\mathbb{B^n}$ denote a closed n-ball. As far as I know, a cell complex is a space, obtained as $X=\cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}_0} X^{(i)}$, such that $X^{(0)}$ is a discrete space and $X^{(n)}$ is obtained from $X^{(n-1)}$ by attaching $n$-cells, i.e. $X^{(n)}$ $=$ $X^{(n-1)}\cup_{f_\lambda}\coprod_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\mathbb{B^n}$ $=$ $X^{(n-1)}\coprod\coprod_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\mathbb{B^n}/_{x\sim f_\lambda(x);\; x\in\mathbb{S}^{n-1},\lambda\in\Lambda}$ and $A\subseteq X$ is closed in $X$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}_0$: $A\cap X^{(n)}$ is closed in $X^{(n)}$. 2) MY PROBLEM: But shouldn't there be some condition on $f_\lambda$? For example, if we have a graph ($1$-dimensional complex) consisting of a single vertex and a single edge. Then when we are attaching $\mathbb{B^2}$, we can set $f$ to map the whole $S^1$ to a single point on the edge, that isn't the vertex. Thus we get a very weird space: Shouldn't $f$ go along each loop/edge in $X^{(1)}$ integer many times and not stop in the middle? Also, how do we prevent $f$ from oscillating infninitely? For example, if $X^{(1)}$ contains two edges $a,b\subseteq\{0\}\times\mathbb{R}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ with $a\cap b=\{(0,0)\}$, then $f(x)=(0,x^2\sin(1/x))$ can go infinitely many times into $a$ and $b$. 3) UNNECESSARY: If you have time/patience/interest, the definitions of a simplicial complex, abstract simplicial complex, Whitehead complex and any other complex are also welcome.","['general-topology', 'differential-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

The problem states Let $R$ be the ring of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ of integers modulo $n$, where $n$ may be prime or composite. Show that every ideal of $R$ is principal. His provided solutions goes as Since an ideal $I$ is a finite set in this case, it must have a finite set of generators $x_1,\ldots, x_k$. Let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of the $x_i$. Every element of $I$ is of the form $a_1x_1+\cdots+a_kx_k$, and hence a multiple of $d$. Thus $I\subseteq (d)$. But $d\in I$, because there are integers $a_i$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^k a_ix_i=d$. Consequently, $(d)\subseteq I$. Why is ""there are integers $a_i$ such that $\sum_i a_ix_i=d$ "" obvious? I don't see this automatically, and would appreciate an explanation. Also, does the proof using the division algorithm fall apart here? When solving it without looking at the answer, I said take $n$ to be the least congruence class in an ideal $I$, then for any $m\in I$, $m=qn+r$ for $0\leq r\lt n$, so $m-qn\in I$ as well, so $r\equiv 0$.

Applying the natural pairing to the $k$th $V$ factor and the $l$th $V^*$ factor, and using the identity on all other factors, defines the $(k,l)$ contraction operation, which is a linear map which yields a tensor of type $(m-1, n-1)$.

From what I gather, the $(k,l)$ contraction of, say, $$T = X_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes X_m \otimes \omega^1 \otimes \ldots \otimes \omega^n$$ is $$C(T) = \omega^l(X_k)\cdot X_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes \widehat{X_k} \otimes \ldots \otimes X_m \otimes \omega^1 \otimes \ldots \otimes \widehat{\omega^l} \otimes \ldots \otimes \omega^n,$$

Now, direct each edge $(u,v)$ towards $v$ if $u > v$. We have what we call a random graph order P, which can be seen as a DAG (directed acyclic graph). We define $L = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m)$ as the longest directed path in DAG (or chain in P) in P. That is, 
$x_i > x_{i+1}$ for all $1 \leq i < m$.  It is known that $|L| = \Theta(n)$.

If we take any $x_i$ in L, what is expected rank of $x_i$? My solution was to assume that $|L| = \frac{n}{t}$, and to assume that the path $L$ partitions the graph $G$ into $|L|$ layers.

What does it actually mean for a real symmetric bilinear form to be positive definite? The definition of positive-definitness in my notes is in terms of subspaces. Does it mean that the entire space is positive definite (w.r.t that particular form)? If so, how does this relate to matrices representing the form? How do we get from this definition to the one I'm finding online, which states that $A$ is positive definite iff $ x^T A x > 0 $ for all x in the space? Thanks. I know that I'm asking a lot, and will greatly appreciate any help.",['linear-algebra']
42268,how do you get values out of this function: $y = f(x)$?,"How can I plug in a value for $x$ in $y = f(x)$ and get a result for $y$? What does the $f$ do in the equation? I know it stands for a function, but does it actually represent a value that I should plug in?",['functions']
42276,Limit of a function. Integration problem,"I have this problem: Let $c\in \mathbb{R}$. If $\int_c^\infty f(x)dx$ converges, then $$\lim_{x\to \infty} f(x)$$ exist and is $0$. Moreover, if $f$ is monotonic, $\lim_{x\to \infty} xf(x)$ exist and is equal to $0$. Although I can't assume that $f$ is continuous, I have tihis question: If $F$ is a function with continuous first derivative, such that $$\lim_{x\to \infty}F(x)=L,$$ for some $L\in\mathbb{R}$. Is it true that $$\lim_{x\to \infty} F'(x)=0\;?$$","['integration', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
42277,Proving that $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f'(x) = 0$ when $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)$ and $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f'(x)$ exist,"I've been trying to solve the following problem: Suppose that $f$ and $f'$ are continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}$, and that $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)$ and $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}f'(x)$ exist. Show that $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}f'(x) = 0$. I'm not entirely sure what to do. Since there's not a lot of information given, I guess there isn't very much one can do. I tried using the definition of the derivative and showing that it went to $0$ as $x$ went to $\infty$ but that didn't really work out. Now I'm thinking I should assume $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}f'(x) = L \neq 0$ and try to get a contradiction, but I'm not sure where the contradiction would come from. Could somebody point me in the right direction (e.g. a certain theorem or property I have to use?) Thanks","['calculus', 'functions', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives', 'limits']"
