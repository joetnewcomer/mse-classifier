627263,Find all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\int_0^\infty \sin(x^\alpha)dx$ converges.,"Find all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\int_0^\infty
 \sin(x^\alpha)dx$ converges. There is an answer here that differs from mine (they claim for $-\infty<\alpha<-2$ and $1<\alpha<\infty$, but I'm not trusting it...they make an error in the third indented line of the solution...they claim that $$\int_0^\infty C u^\beta du$$ is finite for some $\beta$, which is false. Maybe it's just a slip of the pen, and they have the right answer, but here is my analysis: My answer: I claim it is convergent iff $\alpha < -1$. ( Update: iff $|\alpha|>1$.) Case 1 : $\alpha>0$: As $x\to 0$, sine goes to zero, and we have that $\sin(x^\alpha)= x^\alpha + O(x^{3\alpha})$. Therefore we are fine at zero iff $\alpha<1$. Now to examine behavior at infinity, make the substitution $u=x^\alpha$, and $$\int_0^\infty \sin(x^\alpha)dx=\frac{1}{\alpha}\int_0^\infty\sin(u)u^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}du.$$ As $x\to \infty$, also $u \to\infty$, so we consider the behavior at infinity of the above integral. By the Dirichlet test, it will converge iff $\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}<0$, which, along with $\alpha>0$, gives the condition $\alpha>1$. So it works for no $\alpha>0$, and since $\alpha =0$ is a non-starter, we are reduced to the case $\alpha<0$. Case 2 : $\alpha<0$: As $x\to \infty$, $x^{\alpha}\to 0$, so as $x\to\infty$, $\sin(x^\alpha)=x^{\alpha}+O(x^{3\alpha})$. So we have convergence as $x\to \infty$ iff $\alpha <-1$. Now to examine behavior at zero, again integrate by parts and get $$\int_0^\infty \sin(x^\alpha)dx=\frac{1}{\alpha}\int_0^\infty\sin(u)u^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}du,$$ only this time as $x\to 0$, $u\to \infty$. So we find that it is finite as $x\to\infty$ iff $\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}$, which is always true when $\alpha<0$. Therefore it is finite iff $-\infty < \alpha < -1$. Does this work? Can you see any errors in my analysis. I was confident before I read the other answer.

627303,Using the Levi-Civita alternating tensor and suffix notation to concisely write the vector product rule.,"I am reading through a section on vector calculus in an electromagnetism book and it has started to use suffix notation and the Levi-Civita alternating tensor in order to prove some identities.  Some of the identities I am familiar with and others I am not.  The notation is new to me as are the concept of tensors and I am struggling to apply both to do things which I can already do. As an example it is stated in the book that it is much simpler and more concise to write the product rule as $$\left(\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B}\right)_i=\epsilon_{ijk}A_jB_k$$ and I know to work out the product rule I can use the determinant formula. What I am having trouble formulating in my head is how to actually read the above definition and get the correct expansion for the vector-product.  So to make sure I understood the notation I expanded it out on paper but ended up getting the wrong answer.  My interpretations and assumptions are as below: $$\left(\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B}\right)_i = \epsilon_{ijk}A_jB_k$$
$$ = \epsilon_{ijk}A_yB_z\mathbf{i} + \epsilon_{jki}A_zB_x\mathbf{j} + \epsilon_{kij}A_xB_y\mathbf{k} + \epsilon_{jik}A_yB_z\mathbf{j} + \epsilon_{kji}A_zB_x\mathbf{k} + \epsilon_{ikj}A_xB_y\mathbf{i} $$ From here it can be seen that the first three terms are correct, but the last three are not.  I don't understand how the notation links back to the correct unit vector.  Here I have just take the first subscript letter in $\epsilon_{ijk}$ to also represent the relevant unit vector.  So I could really from getting the first three terms correct using the notation correctly write out the last three terms but that is just because I know what it should be.  What I do not understand is how the subscripts of the tensor link up to the subscripts of the two vectors.  I hope that is clear, if it isn't please leave a comment and I will try to remove anything confusing.","['multivariable-calculus', 'tensors', 'vectors']"
627322,Riesz Representation Theorem for functions in $C_0(X)$,"I've been analyzing the proof of Riesz Representation Theorem as presented in Rudin's book for Real and Complex Analysis as Theorem 6.19 and found some steps confusing. First I'd like to know why we can assume that $||\Phi||=1$. It seems to be vital step for proof but it's not fully clear for me why we do so. My first thought was that we can consider functions divided by measure of $X$, since they still belong to $C_0(X)$ and furthermore complex measure can take only finite values. Thus we have $f:=g/\mu(X)$ and $$|\Phi f| \leqslant \int_X |f| d\mu= \frac{1}{|\mu(X)|} \int_X |g| d\mu \leqslant 1$$
for some $g\in C_0(X)$ with sup norm $||g||\leqslant 1$ Is this valid argument? Second thing is why we can write $$\lambda(X)=\sup\{\Lambda f: 0\leqslant f\leqslant 1\; f\in C_c(X)\}?$$
It's obvious that $\sup\{\Lambda f: 0\leqslant f\leqslant 1\; f\in C_c(X)\} \leqslant \lambda(X)$, but how can I prove opposite inequality? These may seem really trivial questions, yet I cannot figure them out. Thanks in advance,

627369,Why does Group Theory not come in here?,"Here is a list of questions that I find quite similar, for the one and only reason that they all show much ""symmetry"". Which is at the same time my problem, because I don't have a very precise notion of that supposed ""symmetry"". Here comes: How prove this inequality $\frac{2}{(a+b)(4-ab)}+\frac{2}{(b+c)(4-bc)}+\frac{2}{(a+c)(4-ac)}\ge 1$ Interesting number theory questions How find this inequality $\max{\left(\min{\left(|a-b|,|b-c|,|c-d|,|d-e|,|e-a|\right)}\right)}$ How to prove this inequality $\frac{x^y}{y^x}+\frac{y^z}{z^y}+\frac{z^x}{x^z}\ge 3$ A generalization of IMO 1983 problem 6 How prove this inequality $(a^2+bc^4)(b^2+ca^4)(c^2+ab^4) \leq 64$ Find max: $M=\frac{a}{b^2+c^2+a}+\frac{b}{c^2+a^2+b}+\frac{c}{a^2+b^2+c}$ How prove this inequality $\frac{a}{b+3}+\frac{b}{c+3}+\frac{c}{d+3}+\frac{d}{a+3}\le 1$ Take the last question as an example. Let $a=b=c=d$ , then $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=4\,$
is of course fulfilled, because we know that $a,b,c,d\ge 0$ , if and only if $a=b=c=d=1$ . Nobody would be surprised (?) if $\;f(a,b,c,d)=a/(b+3)+b/(c+3)+c/(d+3)+d/(a+3)$ assumes
its one and only maximum $f(a,b,c,d)=1/4+1/4+1/4+1/4=1$ precisely for these equal values
of $(a,b,c,d)$ . Very much the same phenomenon is observed with the other of the above questions.
The optimizing parameters turn out to be all equal, which often may be suspected beforehand: ""due to symmetry"". It's frustrating that there seems not to exist a theorem somewhere that guarantees
a maximum or a minimum of a function when all variables in a problem with such high symmetry are just equal. I mean: sort of  formalization of ""by symmetry"" that helps us to find such solutions immediately. Now it is supposed that group theory is the discipline that should teach us a lot about symmetries. So the question is: why doesn't group theory routinely come in here? Update. Unfortunately - and I think it's against the spirit of MSE as well - 
it often happens that the better answers are actually given as a comment .
Indeed, a key reference for this sort of problems is: Do symmetric problems have symmetric solutions? It's only with help of this reference that I could (try to) answer another such question .

in the decimal representation. Is there a largest $n$ with the desired property for any $m$? If so, define $n(m)$ to be this number. Examples : $$m=2 \rightarrow 2^{168} = 374144419156711147060143317175368453031918731001856$$ does not contain the digit $2$. All the powers above up to $2^{10000}$ conatin all the digits, so 
$2^{168}$ seems to be the biggest power with the desired property. $$m=3 \rightarrow 3^{106} = 375710212613636260325580163599137907799836383538729$$ does not contain the digit $4$. All the powers above up to $3^{10000}$ contain all the digits, so
$3^{106}$ seems to be the biggest power with the desired property. So, probably $n(2)=168$ and $n(3)=106$ hold. Is $n(m)$ defined for any $m$, and if yes, can reasonably sharp bounds be given?","['exponentiation', 'decimal-expansion', 'number-theory']"
627412,Why do differential geometry textbooks bother with equivalence classes of smooth structures?,"In contemporary textbooks on differential geometry, the definition of smooth manifolds is given in a (IMHO) awkwardly obfuscated way, by saying that a smooth manifold is a topological space endowed with an equivalence class of compatible atlasses. 
Why does it not suffice to define a differentiable manifold as a topological space together with a single, not necessarily maximal, atlas? If I'm not mistaken, when you proceed by defining smooth maps between manifolds in the usual way, you end up with a category which is at least equivalent to the usual  category. One may argue that the definition of a smooth manifold in terms of a smooth structure has the advantage that two manifolds on the same underlying set which are diffeomorphic by means of a diffeomorphism which is simply the identity on the underlying set, are in fact the very same object, but I don't see why this should be a technical advantage.","['soft-question', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'definition']"
627426,Definition of a branch point (Ahlfors),"This is a continuation to my previous question here . In Ahlfors' complex analysis text, page 299 he says (defines) that a global analytic function $\mathbf{f}$ , which can be continued along all arcs in some punctured disk,  has an algebraic singularity at $z=0$ whenever the Laurent development in terms of the ""local uniformizing variable"" $\zeta$ contains only a finite number of negative powers: In special cases the Laurent development may contain only a finite number of negative powers. Then $F(\zeta)$ has either a removable singularity or a pole, and the multiple-valued function $f(z)$ (or, more correctly, the global analytic function obtained by continuing the given initial branch within a punctured disk) is said to have an algebraic singularity or branch point at $z = 0$ , provided of course that $h > 1$ . If $F(\zeta)$ has a removable singularity, the branch point is an ordinary algebraic singularity, in the opposite case it is an algebraic pole . In either case $f(z)$ tends to a definite limit $A_0$ or $\infty$ as $z$ tends to $0$ along an arbitrary arc. On the next page (I guess) he wants to generalize the concept of a global analytic function by including such branch points: In the case of an algebraic singularity it is desirable to complete the Riemann surface off so as to include a branch point with the projection $a$ . The branch point itself is not a germ of $f$ , but it is fully determined by a set of fractional power series developments $$f_\nu(z)=\sum_{n=n_0}^\infty A_n \omega^{n \nu} (z-a)^{n/h} \tag{3} $$ analogous to (2); for a singularity at infinity $z - a$ has to be replaced by $1/z$ . The neighborhoods of the branch point shall include the branch point itself as well as, for some $\delta > 0$ , all germs $(f_\nu,\zeta)$ with $|\zeta - a| < \delta $ obtained by substituting in (3) a single-valued branch of $(z - a)^{1/h}$ defined in a neighborhood of $\zeta$ . The resulting topological space will be a surface in the sense that every point, including the branch points, has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to a disk. My question is: What is the precise definition of a branch point? From the first quote it appears that it should be the point $a \in \mathbb C$ itself - but that doesn't make sense to me when reading the next quote. Also, if possible please illuminate how the resulting topological space becomes a surface. Thanks!",['complex-analysis']
627427,Puzzled by $\lim\limits_{x \to - \infty} \sqrt{x^2+x}-x$,"I am preparing for the next Semester and therefore review a few of my Analysis I limits, I have found this example in C.T. Michaels Analysis I: Compute $ \displaystyle \lim_{x \to - \infty} \sqrt{x^2+x}-x$ Aprior to this exercise I computed the same limit but as $x$ approaches $\infty$ rather than $- \infty$. So I thought that this should be a piece of cake, but apparently the $- \infty$ makes all the difference for me. My approach : This is the general approach I take when it comes to roots, especially square roots. Consider: $$ \sqrt{x^2+x}-x= \left(\sqrt{x^2+x}-x\right)\cdot \frac{\sqrt{x^2+x}+x}{\sqrt{x^2+x}+x}= \frac{x^2+x-x^2}{\sqrt{x^2+x}+x}=\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+x}+x}$$
Factoring out an $x$ will get me to: $$ \frac{x}{x\left(\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{x}}+1\right)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{x}}+1}$$
So as I take the limit of the above expressing as $x$ approaches $\infty$ I obtain the correct answer $1/2$. However, when I study the limit as $x$ approaches $- \infty$ I don't see how that would make a difference since $1 / - \infty=0$, but the correct answer in that case would be $\infty$ http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=lim+x+to+-infty+sqrt%28x%5E2%2Bx%29-x My question (s): Where is/are my mistakes?

627512,$f(x) \neq x$ ambiguity?,"The question is : An integer function $f(x)$ is valid only for $x = 0, 1, 2, 3$ and has an interesting property $f(f(x)) = x$. It is also known that $f(x) \ne x$. Find out how many such functions exist. This problem was on a mock mathcounts test that we did as a team at MATHCOUNTS Practice. My solution is as follows: We have two cases: Case 1: 0 goes to 1, 1 goes to 0, 2 goes to 3, 3 goes to 2. There are $\dbinom42 / 2 = 3$ ways this configuration can occur (we simply must form two groups of two) Case 2: 0 goes to 1, 1 goes to 0, 2 goes to 2, 3 goes to 3. There are $\dbinom42 = 6$ ways; we simply choose the two that are paired. We don't need to consider 0 - 0, 1 - 1, 2 - 2, 3 - 3 because $f(x) \ne x$. However, the answer was $3$ and the given solution was simply ""$\dfrac{\dbinom42}{2} = 3$"". Not very explanatory, but from this we can see that they intended a different meaning of $f(x) \ne x$ then I interpreted. I took $f(x) \ne x$ meaning the function, $f(x)$, is not equal to the function $f(x) = x$. In my mind, two polynomials are equal if their difference forms the zero polynomial. For example, $f(x) = x$ and $f(x) = 2x + 1$ are not equal, though they are equal at $x = -1$.

According to me, the question should have either specified their intended definition of $\ne$, or given an example of an acceptable configuration that would clear up the doubt. However, my coach believes that the question contains no ambiguity what so ever, the question is clear as it is, and $3$ is the one and only correct answer.

  Nelson gave a particularly short proof of this theorem, using the mean
  value property mentioned above: Given two points, choose two balls with the given points as centers and of equal radius. If the radius is large enough, the two balls will
  coincide except for an arbitrarily small proportion of their volume.
  Since f is bounded, the averages of it over the two balls are
  arbitrarily close, and so f assumes the same value at any two points. But this is an error, right? Because Nelson's proof works if the harmonic function is bounded in modulus , not just bounded above or below. What is a simple way to exetend the proof to the case that the function is bounded above or below? If such doesn't exist, where can I find a different proof of this fact?

Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity and consider the set $Z \subset R$ of zero divisors. If the ideal $I\subset Z$ is maximal with respect to the constraint, need it be prime? Since Zorn's Lemma applies equally well to proving that either minimal prime ideals exist or that maximal ideals contained in $Z$ exist, this would provide an alternative proof of that question if true. A naive approach to proving this is to assume $ab \in I$ with $a, b \notin I$. Since $ab \in I$, it follows that $ab$ is a zero divisor, so $abx = 0$ for some $x \neq 0$, and therefore either $a$ is a zero divisor annihilated by $bx \neq 0$ or $b$ is a zero divisor annihilated by $x$. In either case, the obvious thing to consider would be $aR+I$ or $bR+I$, but there's no obvious reason why either of these ideals should consist of zero divisors.

$$4xy''+2(1-x)y'-y=0  .$$
What I did is the following. First I let the solution $y$ be equal to 
$$y =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} b_ix^i =b_0 +b_1x+b_2x^2+\ldots$$
for undetermined $b_i$. Then I found the expression for $y'$ and $y''$,
$$y' =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} ib_ix^{i-1} =b_1 + 2b_2x+3b_3x^2+\ldots.$$
and
$$y'' =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} i(i-1)b_ix^{i-2} =2b_2+6b_3x+12b_4x^2\ldots.$$
Now I put these in the original DE to get
$$4\sum   i(i-1)b_ix^{i-1}+2\sum ib_i(x^{i-1}-x^i) - \sum b_ix^i =0   $$
where all sums range from $0$ to infinity. Finally this becomes
$$\sum \left\{    (4i(i-i)b_i+2ib_i )x^{i-1}+(-2ib_i-b_i)x^i \right\}=0.$$
At this point I am fairly certain I have already made a mistake somewhere, probably in working out the power series of $y'$ or $y''$. Who can help point it out to me, I am pretty sure in the last sum there should be terms like $b_{i+1}$ or $b_{i+2}$. Thanks for any help or tips! EDIT I have gotten further by realizing that $$y' =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} ib_ix^{i-1} =\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} ib_ix^{i-1}=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (i+1)b_{i+1}x^{i}$$
and 
$$y'' =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (i+2)(i+1)b_{i+2}x^{i}.$$
Putting these in the original DE I get
$$\sum \left\{   [4(i+2)(i+1)b_{i+2}-2(i+1)b_{i+1}]x^{i+1} + [2(i+1)b_{i+1}-b_i]x^i  \right\}=0.$$ 
This must be true for all $x$ and thus we have 
$$4(i+2)(i+1)b_{i+2}=2(i+1)b_{i+1}$$
and 
$$2(i+1)b_{i+1} = b_i.$$
After simplyfying these two conditions are seen to be identical. Now I've set $b_0=1$ to obtain the solution 
$$ y = 1 + \frac{x}{2}+ \frac{x^2}{8} +\frac{x^3}{48}+\ldots + \frac{x^i}{2^i(i!)}+\ldots.$$

628299,"What exactly is the ""Carathéodory Extension theorem""?","I have read four texts introducing a theorem so-called ""Carathéodory's Extension Theorem"", and they all differ. Here is the statement of the Carathéodory Extension Theorem in Wikipedia : Let $\mathfrak{R}$ be a ring of subsets of $X$
  Let $\mu:\mathfrak{R} \rightarrow [0,\infty]$ be a premeasure.
  Then, there exists a measure on the σ-algebra generated by $\mathfrak{R}$ which is a extension of $\mu$. I like this statement since it is very simple and clear. However mainstream textbooks don't introduce the Caratheodory Extension Theorem as this. For example, Royden's Real Analysis (4th edition) defines premeasure as a set function which is finitely additive , countably monotone (is this a widely used term?), which is different from the definition in wikipedia. Then, he proves a theorem so-called Carathéodory-Hahn Extension Theorem. This theorem does not imply the 'Carathéodory Extension Theorem in Wikipedia' but is deeper than that in Wikipedia, in my opinion. Since he defined premeasure differently, I am quite hesitant to memorize this. I don't want to be out of the mainstream. He even doesn't require the domain of a given set function to have an empty set. Another example, Folland's Real Analysis states Carathéodory's Theorem as follows: If $\mu^*$ is an outer measure on $X$, the collection $\mathcal{M}$ of $\mu^*$-measureable sets is a σ-algebra, and the restriction of $\mu^*$ to $\mathcal{M}$ is a complete measure. Even though this is critical in any proof for any kind of Extension Theorem, this is obviously not 'the Carathéodory Extension Theorem'. What is the Carathéodory Extension Theorem? It is off the topic, but I have one more question. Why Royden tries to include set functions whose domain does not contain an empty set? If the emptyset is not in a domain, can't we just extend a given set function by defining $\mu(\emptyset)=0$? Does this sometimes break structure of a given set?

That is, if 1 judge has rated then a relatively low score from 2 judges will not put in under 90, vice versa if 2 judges have rated, a relatively low score from 1 judge will not put in under 90. As an example, if 2 judges give the object a score of 97 and 1 member with weight 1600 gives it a score of 99, that is a total of 2*97*2500+99*1600, which would trigger the system that it is very unlikely that the 3rd judge will give it a score low enough to make the average dip below 90, therefore rating should end early, and without the 3rd needed judge.","['statistics', 'average']"

628564,Is there an elementary proof that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty {1\over n^s\{n\pi\}}<\infty$ for some $s>0$?,"Edit: David Speyer's answer made me realize a couple of things and I would like to clarify. Sorry if the length of this is getting out of hand. First, it is now clear that no estimate can be obtained for $\sigma(\alpha)$ without also obtaining an estimate for the irrationality measure of $\alpha$. This means that any technique used to estimate $\sigma(\alpha)$ can be translated into a technique for estimating the irrationality measure, and so it will not be any simpler as I'd hoped. Still, I wonder if there are any techniques that seem natural for estimating $\sigma(\alpha)$ (such as series transformations) that would not seem natural without introducing the series. For instance, though I'm sure it can be reasoned through directly, I would not have thought that the formula for the abscissa of convergence I referred to at the bottom in $(3)$ would provide an estimate for irrationality measure. Thus I suppose I'm still looking for a way to approach convergence of the series that does not involve simply obtaining a term-wise estimate (which would essentially be bounding the irrationality measure first). If you think this is a fool's errand, I'd certainly like to hear that as well. Second (and this might merit its own question if I can't resolve it), in light of David's answer I wonder if anything more can be said about the relationship between $\sigma(\alpha)$ and the irrationality measure. Can they ever be different? If so: We know that the irrationality measure of an algebraic number is $2$; are there any examples where we can explicitly compute $\sigma(\alpha)$? Finally, a minor correction to the definitions: What I've been calling $\mu(\alpha)$ is actually the irrationality measure of $\alpha$ minus one. I want to avoid getting caught up in trivial details so let me just redefine $\mu(\alpha)$ to be the least upper bound of the set of all exponents $s>0$ such that $\{n\alpha\} \geq n^{-s}$ for all but finitely many $s$. Everything below should remain the same. Original Question For $x\in\mathbb R$, let $\{x\} = x-\lfloor x\rfloor$ be the fractional part of $x$. I'm searching for an elementary proof that there exists a positive real number $s$ such that
$$
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty {1\over n^s\{n\pi\}}<\infty. \tag{1}
$$ The problem is certainly resolved by invoking the finite irrationality measure of $\pi$. It is known that
$$
\{n\pi\} \geq {1\over n^8} \tag{2}
$$
for all but finitely many integers $n$. (See the MathOverflow question numbers with known irrationality measure for references.) This implies that $(1)$ converges for $s>9$. But the proof of $(2)$ is very involved. There are other larger bounds on the irrationality measure of $\pi$ that have been known for longer and are probably easier to prove. But finite irrationality measure, while sufficient, does not seem necessary to ensure convergence of $(1)$. So I'm wondering if there isn't a qualitative way to prove that $(1)$ converges for some $s$ (no need to give an explicit $s$). While I say I seek an elementary proof, I'll settle for a proof that doesn't rely on explicit computation of irrationality measure. The choice of $\pi$ is somewhat arbitrary—I made that choice to give a sense of concreteness to the problem. Perhaps a more general framework for the question is as follows. For irrational $\alpha$, define $\sigma(\alpha)$ to be the abscissa of convergence for the Dirichlet series
$$
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty {1\over n^s\{n\alpha\}}.
$$
Clearly $\sigma(\alpha)\geq 1$ in all circumstances. If $\alpha$ has irrationality measure $\mu(\alpha)$, then $\sigma(\alpha)\leq \mu(\alpha) + 1$ (since then $(2)$ holds with $\alpha$ in place of $\pi$ and $\mu(\alpha)+\epsilon$ in place of the exponent $8$ for any $\epsilon>0$). But it's conceivable that $\sigma(\alpha)$ could be much less than $\mu(\alpha)+1$. Indeed, this seems likely: If $s > 1$ and $n_1,n_2,n_3,\dots$ is a sequence of integers such that $\{n_i\alpha\}\leq n_i^{-s}$, then the numbers $n_i$ must grow very fast. [ Edit: As David Speyer's answer indicates this is clearly foolish!] Note: According to the Wikipedia page on general Dirichlet series , the abscissa $\sigma(\alpha)$ is given by
\begin{align*}
\sigma(\alpha) = \limsup_{n\to\infty}{\log{\left({1\over\{\alpha\}}+\cdots+{1\over\{n\alpha\}}\right)}\over\log{n}}.\tag{3}
\end{align*}
I just now found this formula, so I haven't yet played with it. Maybe it could help prove that $\sigma(\pi)$ is finite.","['elementary-number-theory', 'irrational-numbers', 'number-theory']"

$$ \t a_0(f(x)) + \t a_1(f(x)) \dfrac{d u(y)}{dy} \Bigg|_{y=f(x)} = a_0(x) + a_1(x) \dfrac{du(x)}{dx}.$$
But how should I take $\t a_0, \t a_1$ to obtain this equality? ii) case $ d = 2$. A linear differential operator has the form
$$ A= a_{00} + a_{10} \dfrac{\p}{\p x_1} + a_{01} \dfrac{\p}{\p x_2} + a_{11} \dfrac{\p^2}{\p x_2} + a_{20} \dfrac{\p^2}{\p x_1 ^2} + a_{02} \dfrac{\p^2}{\p x_2^2}.$$ Considering  the change of variable $Y = (y_1, y_2) = (f_1(x_1, x_2), f_2(x_1, x_2)) = F(X)$, we will have that the operator $\t A$ expresses $A$ in the new coordinates if

$$C(y,z)= (\sqrt{1-z^2}, y,z).$$ Now to find the surface area across a bounded region $\Delta \subset D$, we would integrate $$\iint_\Delta |n(y,z)|dydz.$$ I get $|n(y,z)|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}.$ Now to find the surface area (of the back half of intersection between the two cylinders) we can just integrate $$\iint_\Delta \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}dydz,$$ where $\Delta$ is the unit disk in the $yz$-plane. I calculate this to be $4$. But my solution is off by a factor of 2 (according to the answer above, the total integral should be $16$, meaning the integral of the back half should be $8$).

628874,Quadratic Reciprocity Joke,"I found a joke on a site made by user Zev Chonoles on quadratic reciprocity, the joke is as follows: $$\text{Quadratic reciprocity: } \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)=\left(\frac{q}{p}\right), \text{ up to sign.}$$ I assume it's a joke because the quadratic characters on opposite sides of the equality can only take on values $\pm 1$ (assuming $p \ne q$ are distinct primes) making the statement trivial. That is the joke right? If not can someone explain","['quadratic-reciprocity', 'soft-question', 'number-theory']"
