For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta$ so that $|x-1|< \delta \Rightarrow \frac{x^2-x-2}{2x-3}-2 < \varepsilon$.

Riemann sums; and $A$ is the norm limit of finite linear combinations with
coefficients in $sp(A)$ of orthogonal projections $E_{\lambda'}-E_\lambda$. I want to know what (3) means and also what is the relationship between such so called ""spectral resolution"" $E_\lambda$ and the spectral measure?","['operator-theory', 'operator-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"

534245,Towards a Quantum Peter Weyl Theorem,"This is taken from Timmermann's Invitation to Quantum Groups and Duality . Let $(A,\Delta)$ be a *-Hopf algebra and let $\chi:V\rightarrow V\otimes A$ be a corepresentation of $(A,\Delta)$ on a vector space $V$. Call a vector subspace $W\subset V$ invariant with respect to $\chi$ if $\chi(W)\subset W\otimes A$. Question If $\chi$ is unitary and $W\subset V$ is an invariant subspace, then the orthogonal complement $W^\perp$ is invariant also. Timmermann proceeds as follows.
Define a map from the dual of $A$, $\pi:A'\rightarrow \hom(V)$ by
$$\pi(f)v:=(I\otimes f)\chi(v).$$
Timmerman proves that $W\subset V$ is invariant with respect to $\chi$ if and only if $\pi(A')W\subset W$. Now he simply states ""Now the claim follows from a standard argument."" The problem is that I don't see what this standard argument is. Initially I said suppose that $\tilde{w}\in W^\perp$ so that $\langle\tilde{w},w\rangle=0$. Then I calculated
$$\langle \pi(f)\tilde{w},w\rangle=\sum\langle {\tilde{w}}_{(0)}f(\tilde{w}_{(1)}),w\rangle$$
where the Sweedler notation is used. This didn't really go anywhere. The next idea was to say that $\pi$ was non-degenerate and use Timmermann's result that $\pi$ is an algebra homomorphism of $A'$ with the multiplication/convolution $(f,g)\mapsto (f\otimes g)\Delta$. The next part was what do inverses of $f$ look like here? $$(f\otimes f^{-1})\Delta(a)=1?$$ If I could do something like this I could certainly carry out a standard argument (familiar to me from the classical Peter Weyl Theorem). Let $\tilde{w}\in W^\perp$ and $w\in W$: $$\langle \pi(f)\tilde{w},w\rangle=\langle \pi(f^{-1})\pi(f)\tilde{w},\pi(f^{-1})w\rangle$$ but I can't quite justify those calculations.

534314,Substituting total derivative d for partial derivative \partial,"In economic models it seems to be commonplace to substitute a total derivative derived from one equation, say $\frac{d k}{d \tau}$ , for the partial derivative derived from another equation, say $\frac{\partial k}{\partial \tau}$ . Why is it allowed to perform this substitution? After all, $d$ and $\partial$ are different concepts, are they not? Here is a (simplified) example from a model on tax competition by Köthenbürger (2002) : A firm maximizes profits from the production and sale of a single good. One of the resulting first-order conditions is $f_k(k) = r(\tau) + \tau$ , where $f_k$ is the derivative of the production function with respect to the input capital $k$ , $r$ is the interest rate, and $\tau$ is the tax rate of a tax on capital. Differentiating with respect to $k$ and $\tau$ on both sides, we can rearrange to arrive at $$
\frac{d k}{d \tau} = \frac{\frac{\partial r}{\partial \tau} + 1}{f_{kk}}
$$ The model also contains the maximization problem of a government which yields the first-order condition $$
\frac{d u}{d \tau} = u_c \left( - f_{kk} \frac{\partial k}{\partial \tau} k + \dots \right) + \dots \overset{!}{=} 0
$$ The analysis of the model continues with a substitution of $\frac{d k}{d \tau}$ from the first equation for $\frac{\partial k}{\partial \tau}$ in the second equation.","['economics', 'partial-derivative', 'derivatives']"

$$3x^2y + x^3\frac{dy}{dx} - y^3 - 3y^2x\frac{dy}{dx} = 0. $$ So $$3x^2y - y^3 = (3y^2x -x^3)\frac{dy}{dx}, $$ and hence 
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2y - y^3}{3y^2x - x^3}. $$ Now, the slope of the other family of curves will be the negative inverse, so for the orthogonal trajectory, we have $$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{3y^2x-x^3}{3x^2y-y^3}, $$ which we can write as 
$$-(3y^2x-x^3)dx = (3x^2y-y^3)dy. $$ Integration of the last differential equation yields 
$$-\frac{3}{2}y^2x^2 + \frac{x^4}{4} = \frac{3}{2}x^2y^2 - \frac{y^4}{4} + \beta, $$ $\beta$ being an arbitrary constant. 
This simplifies to $$-3y^2x^2 + \frac{x^4}{4} + \frac{y^4}{4} = \beta. $$ which is not correct. Where am I going wrong?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus']"

534633,Equivalent definitions of Tangent space - 2,"L.S., In my book Vector Analysis by Klaus Jänich, Three different 'versions' of the Tangent space of a point $p$ at a differentiable variety are being discussed.

(with two curves equivalent when they have the same derivative in 0 on chart) The 'algebraic': the set of al derivations on the ring of germs at $p$, that satisfy the product rule. The 'physical' the set of al vectors that send al the charts around $p$ to a subspace of $\mathbb R^n$, with the property that for any two charts the associated vectors in $\mathbb R^n$ are mapped to eachother by the differential of the transition map. Then three maps are given, $\phi_1$ : geometric $ \rightarrow $ algebraic by $f\mapsto(f\circ\alpha$)$'$$(0)$ $\phi_2$ : algebraic $ \rightarrow $ physical by $(U,h)$ $\mapsto$ $(v(h_1), ..., v(h_n))$ $\phi_3$ : physical $ \rightarrow $ geometric by $(\alpha(t) := h^{-1}(h(p) + tv(U,h))$ and then is stated that $\phi_1 \circ\phi_2 \circ\phi_3 = Id$ $\phi_2 \circ\phi_3 \circ\phi_1 = Id$ $\phi_3 \circ\phi_1  \circ\phi_2 = Id$ And it is shown for the first equation that it holds. I also understand the third equation I think. These are pages 27 - 36 of the book. My question is: How to show that the second equation holds? (this is not a homework question) The book says it goes in a similar way as the first, but I get stuck at a point. If you take the composite, you'll get in the end a derivation that sends any $f$ in the ring of germs at $p$ to $f \circ h^{-1} \circ (h(p) + tv(U,h))'(0)$.

\begin{align}
I_2=\left(-\frac{\pi}{2} ,\frac{\pi}{2} \right] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \tag{Problem}

I first tried the easier case, i.e.
\begin{align}f_1:I_1=\left(-\frac{\pi}{2} ,\frac{\pi}{2} \right) &\longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \\ x& \longmapsto \tan(x)
\end{align}
which is a bijection. Now I know that the composition of bijective functions is still a bijection. Which means that it should be possible to 'make room' for the missing point $\pi/2$. The following function:
\begin{align}\phi : \mathbb{R} &\longrightarrow \mathbb{R \setminus}\lbrace 0 \rbrace \\ x & \longmapsto \begin{cases}x+1  \ \text{if} \ x \in \mathbb{N}_0 \\x \ \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\end{align} 
would be bijective, such that the composition $\phi \circ f_1: I_1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\setminus \lbrace 0 \rbrace  $ is bijective, and as desired it now has room for a point that I can map to. At this point I am not sure if my approach is correct because I can't find a function that would do the trick. Would I need to come up with another composition or is it enough to define a function that maps to the functions introduced above? Update (in consideration of the answers given) If I understand things correctly I can define: \begin{align}f_2: I_2 &\longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \\ x& \longmapsto \begin{cases}\phi(x) \ \text{for}  \ x \in I_2 \\0 \ \text{for}  \ x=\frac{\pi}{2} \end{cases} \end{align} Update 2 (Clarification required) . Define a new function to be equal to $\phi f_1$ over $I_1$ and have it map $π/2$ to $0$. As suggested (and upvoted) by @TBrendle. If I do understand this correctly, then I need to map $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $0$. However in this case it would make no sense to me to include $I_1$ in the domain, because $\pi/2$ is not in the domain, hence I don't see why I should include it in the codomain, however if I define:
\begin{align}w: I_2 &\longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \\ (\phi\circ f_1)(x) & \longmapsto \begin{cases} (\phi \circ f_1) \ \text{if} \ x \in I_2 \\ 0 \ \text{if} \ x= \frac{\pi}{2} \end{cases} \end{align}

that something like $\left(X\mid Y=y\right)$ , i.e. $X$ under condition
$Y=y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are real-valued random variables and $P\left\{ Y=y\right\}>0 $, is not a well defined random variable. To see
if he is right I need the definition of real-valued random variable.
Is there a commonly accepted one? Constructing an answer for myself
(see below) I come to a definition such that $\left(X\mid Y=y\right)$ is a well
defined real-valued random variable. In my view a real-valued random variable can be defined as a quadruple
$\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P,X\right)$ where $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P\right)$
is a probability space and $X:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a measurable
function. Here $\mathbb{R}$ is equipped with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra.
The quadruple is abbreviated by $X$. Now let $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P,X\right)$
and $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P,Y\right)$ be random variables according to this definition and
for $y\in\mathbb{R}$ such let it be that $P\left\{ Y=y\right\} >0$.
Then $\left(X\mid Y=y\right)$ can be recognized as random variable
$\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A},Q,X\right)$ where $Q\left(A\right):=P\left(A\cap\left\{ Y=y\right\} \right)/P\left\{ Y=y\right\} $
on $\mathcal{A}$. I also tag categories because my definition is interpreting the real valued random variable somehow as an arrow in a category. An arrow is determining for its domain.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'category-theory', 'soft-question']"

However, I'm having a lot of trouble finding a solution that sufficiently satisfies me. My best argument so far is as follows, $$a_{n} = \frac{n\cdot n\cdot n\cdot \ldots\cdot n}{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)\dots(2)(1)} = \frac{n}{n}\cdot \frac{n}{n-1}\cdot  \ldots \cdot \frac{n}2\cdot n$$ so $\lim a_{n}\rightarrow \infty$ since $n<a_{n}$ for all $n>1$.

This feels a little dubious to me, I feel like I can form a much better argument than that, or at the very least a more elegant one. I've tried to assume $\{a_{n}\}$ approaches some limit $L$ so there exists some $N$ such that $|a_{n} - L| < \epsilon$ whenever $n>N$ and derive a contradiction, but this approach got me nowhere.

What happens when instead of notions like ""$\sigma$ algebra"" and countable additivity, you replace every occurrence of countability with some larger cardinal?  So the reals may not be quite the right place to carry out such a theory because if you have an arbitrary sized disjoint union of ""measurable"" sets in the proposed theory, then unless all but countable many have ""measure 0"" we would have that the measure would have to be infinity or undefined in the signed case all the time.  But what happens if more general values of the measures are taken, like say in a Banach space?

535600,Sum of Sinusoids with Same Frequency = Sinusoid (proof),"I am studying Fourier analysis on my own, I realised that probably the first thing you want to proof in Fourier transform is that the sum of 2 sinuoids (namely a sine and cosine) with the same frequency gives another sinusoid. So I am trying to find a proof of this. In this document , I found this identity: $$ A\cos(\omega t + \alpha) + B\sin(\omega t + \beta)
= \color{red}{\sqrt{(A\cos\alpha + \beta\sin\beta)^2 + (A \sin\alpha - B\cos\beta)^2}} \cdot \cos\left(\omega t + \color{green}{\arctan \frac{A\sin\alpha - B\cos\beta}{A\cos\alpha+B\sin\beta}}\right)
$$ EDIT: sorry I made mistake in equation. Assuming I know how to go from the equation on the left to the equation on the right, would it be good enough as a proof since I can say that the terms that I highlighted with color are constants thus that the sum of the cosine and sine is equal to a constant multiplied by a cosine of the same frequency with some constant phase shift. It would be great to have the confirmation from an expert. Thank you.","['trigonometry', 'fourier-analysis']"
535605,Euler Lagrange equation for harmonic maps,"In the paper ""The existence of minimal immersions of 2-spheres"" by Sacks and Uhlenbeck the authors claim that the Euler Lagrange equation for the modified functional $E_\alpha(s) = \int_M (1 + |ds(x)|^2)^\alpha d\mu$, $\alpha>1$, is
$$
\Delta s + (\alpha - 1)\frac{(d^2s,ds)ds}{1+|ds|^2} + A(s)(ds,ds) = 0
$$
namely Equation (2). As far as I understand, this is a compact form. But how should I interpret it?
Can anyone help me unravel the equation in order to write it neatly in components? @John: what I mean is the following: if we were given the classical Euler-Lagrange equation for harmonic maps, i.e.
$$
\Delta s + A(s)(ds,ds) = 0,
$$
this could be re-written as, putting $\phi = i \circ s$,
$$
\Delta \phi^a(x) + g^{ij}(x) A^a_{s(x)} ( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x^i}; \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x^j} ) =0,
$$
where $i$ is the immersion in $R^k$ of the target manifold, $a=1,2,...,k$ and $x^i$ are local coordinates on the first manifold. Now I would like to do something similar to the equation above, but the middle term in the left hand side is troublesome.","['calculus-of-variations', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

535623,How many irreducible factors does $x^n-1$ have over finite field?,"The polynomial $x^n-1$ is needed to be factorized into irreducibles over finite field $\mathrm{F}_q$. How many are them? I guess the question is about of number of cyclotomic cosets. Let $p$ be the smallest positive that $n$ divides $q^p - 1$. The desired factors are the minimal polynomials of elements from field $\mathrm{F}_{q^p}$. Each minimal polynomial is known to have roots those can be obtained with help of some $q$-cyclomatic coset of $\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$. So, given $n$, $q$, $p$, how many unique $q$-cyclotomic cosets of $\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$ exist?","['finite-fields', 'irreducible-polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

535643,About the universal bundle $EG\rightarrow BG$,"For a topological group $G$, we define $EG$ to be the infinite join of $G$, and $B$ to be the quotient of $EG$ by the left action of $G$. Explicitly $EG$ can be expressed, as a set, as $EG=\lbrace(g_{0},t_{0},g_{1},t_{1},\cdots)\in(G\times I)^{\infty}\rbrace/\sim$ such that at most finitely many $t_{i}$ are nonzero, $\sum t_{i}=1$, and the equivalence relation is induced from the join. Milnor proved that this $EG\rightarrow BG$ is a numerable principal $G$-bundle, and this is a universal bundle. I am now studying the fact using some modern references (especially Paul Selick's ""Introduction to Homotopy Theory"" and Tammo tom Dieck's ""Algebraic Topology""), and I can understand most of the proof, but one thing matters in my mind. Specifically, the proofs in both books say that this bundle $EG\rightarrow BG$ is numerable since $\lbrace U_{i}\rbrace_{i=0}^{\infty}$ forms a numerable cover for the bundle where $V_{i}=\lbrace(g_{0},t_{0},\cdots)\in EG\mid t_{i}>0\rbrace$ and $U_{i}:=V_{i}/G\subset BG$. But I think this cover is not locally finite, but just point-finite. Indeed I can modify the definition of $V_{i}$ to be, for instance, something like $\lbrace(g_{0},t_{0},\cdots)\in EG\mid t_{i}>2^{-(i+2)}\rbrace$, and then I can believe that $U_{i}$'s form a numerable cover. But I am afraid of the possibility that I have some misunderstandings about the topology of joins. Am I wrong? Please clarify this issue for me.","['general-topology', 'homotopy-theory']"
535645,Weak* operator topology and finite rank operators,"We will say that ${T_i}\subset B(X,Y^*)$ converges to $T$ in W*-operator topology if $T_i(x)\rightarrow T(x)$ in W*-topology of $Y^*$( $\forall y\in Y \langle T_i(x),y\rangle \rightarrow \langle T(x),y\rangle$). Now someone has proved the below theorem. Is it true? BEGIN Let $X$ and $Y$ be two arbitrary Banach spaces. Then $F (X; Y^*)$(Finite rank operator) is dense in $B(X; Y^*)$ with
respect to the weak* operator topology. Proof. Let $T \in B(X; Y^*)$ and take a finite subset $F =\{ x_1,...,x_n\}$ of X. Assume
that $x_1,...,x_m$ are linearly independent for all $m\leq n$. By the Hahn Banach theorem, for
each $j\in \{1,2,...,m\}$ there is $f_j\in X^*$ such that $f_j(x_j) = 1$ and $f_j(x_i) = 0$ for all $i\in\{1,2,...,m\}-\{j\}$.For each $j\in\{1,...,m\}$ define $T_j\in B(X; Y^*)$ by $T_j(x) = f_j(x)T(x_j)$.Then $$T_j(x_j) = T(x_j); T_j(x_i) = 0\ \  (i, j\in\{1,...,m\}, i\neq j)$$
Now define $T_F = T_1 +...+ T_m$. It can be easily seen that $$T_F(x_i) = T(x_i)\ \ (i\in\{1,...,n\})$$
So $T_F = T$ on the span of $F$ and $\operatorname{rank}(T_F)\leq \dim F$. Now it is obvious that the net
$(T_F)_{F\in F(X)}$$\big(F(X)=$ all finite subset of $X\big)$ converges to $T$ in the weak* operator topology, as desired. END If it is true then my question is this that why we can't say $T_F\rightarrow T$ in strong operator topology($T_F(x)\rightarrow T(x) \ \ \forall x\in X$)?","['operator-theory', 'operator-algebras', 'compact-operators', 'functional-analysis']"
