2647909,Rational Trig Solutions for $n\ge 3$,"Are there solutions to
$$\sin(x+y)\sin(x-y)=n\ \sin(x)\sin(y)$$
for $n\ge 3$ where $x$ and $y$ are rational multiples of $\pi$? (excluding the trivial solutions when both sides are $0$). Known solutions are:
$$n=1:\quad x=\frac{2}{5}\pi\quad y = \frac{1}{5}\pi$$
$$n=2:\quad x=\frac{3}{8}\pi\quad y = \frac{1}{8}\pi$$ I've reworked the equation a few times using trig identities with no luck. I used identities like
$$3\sin(x)=\sin(3x)-4\sin^3(x)$$
$$2\sin(x)=\sin(x-\pi/4)+\sin(x+\pi/4)$$
$$2^k\sin(x)=\sin(2^kx)\prod_{i=0}^{k-1}\cos(2^ix)$$
One can work out that
$$x=\sin^{-1}\Big[\frac{1}{2}\sin(y)(n\pm\sqrt{n^2+4})\Big]$$
But this was of no help either. My last attempt was to use the identity
$$a\sin(x)+b\sin(x)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(x+a\tan 2(a,b))$$
to show that there is no solution when $n$ cannot be expressed as the sum of 2 squares. But I was unable to find an workable expressions for $\text{atan2}(a,b)$. The problem is originally about ratios of diagonals of polygons. Such ratios may be written with the roots of unity as
$$r=\Big|\frac{1-\zeta_c^a}{1-\zeta_d^b}\Big|$$
We wish to find integers $a,b,c,d$ such that $r$ satisfies $r-r^{-1}=n$ for some positive integer $n$. In the case $n=1$, we are looking for the golden ratio. The relationship to the former trig equations is that
$$r=\frac{\sin(\pi\frac{a}{c})}{\sin(\pi\frac{b}{d})}$$","['golden-ratio', 'trigonometry', 'roots-of-unity', 'rational-numbers']"

2647974,How to show equality $A = (A\setminus B) \cup (A\setminus C) \cup (A \cap B \cap C)$,"I need help with proving that:
$$\tag{1}A = (A\setminus B) \cup (A\setminus C) \cup (A \cap B \cap C).$$ I started first with $2$ sets I showed that $A = (A\setminus B) \cup(A\cap B)$ like this: $A \cap U$ $A \cap(\overline B \cup B) $ Distributive Law $\Rightarrow(A\cap\overline B) \cup(A\cap B) $ Using $(A\cap \overline B) = A\setminus B$ I got $(A\setminus B) \cup (A\cap B)  $ Now I tried to show, with same rules used up there, for sets $A,B,C$ that (1) holds. But the expression got ugly and I got stuck. I tried to show with inclusions that 2 sets are equal: $(\supseteq)$ is trivial, because for each of the 3 sets in the RHS has $x \in A$. $(\subseteq)$ Let $x\in A$. I ""split"" set $A$ in two cases. First I assumed that $x\in A \setminus(B\cup C)$. Then since $A \setminus(B\cup C)\subseteq A\setminus B$, we have
$$x\in (A\setminus B) \cup (A\setminus C) \cup (A \cap B\cap C) .$$
Second case was $x\notin A \setminus(B\cup C)$. Then $(x\notin A) \lor (x\in (B\cap C))$. $x\notin A$ is contradiction, so $x\in (B\cap C)$ and with that $x\in (A\setminus B) \cup (A\setminus C) \cup (A \cap B\cap C)$. Can I split $A$ in two cases like I did and if someone could hint me how to start with showing equality using laws because I want to know both ways.",['elementary-set-theory']
2647991,Change of variable and divergence,"Given $x=(x_1, \cdots , x_n)$ with $dx$ being the Lebesgue measure,
  suppose we do the change of variable  $h(x) = w$, a vector field
  $v(x)$ is divergence free $$\text{div}(v(x)) = 0$$  then after the
  change of variable $\tilde v = dh(v)$, multiplied by the new density
  $\rho$ from $dx \mapsto \rho dw$, is still divergence free
  $$\text{div}(\rho\tilde v(w)) = 0.$$ I worked out an example: $v= (x,-y)$ is a divergence free vector field in the Cartesian coordinate. $h(x,y) = (\sqrt{x^2+y^2}, \arctan(y/x)) = (r,\theta)$ is the change of variable from Cartesian to polar. The density $dxdy \mapsto rdrd\theta$ is $r$. The new vector field in terms of $\partial_r$ and $\partial_\theta$: $$\tilde v  = dh(v) = Jh(v) = (r(\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta), -2\sin\theta\cos\theta).$$ $\text{div}(r\tilde v) = 2r(\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta) -  2r(\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta)  = 0$. Now I am confused because the divergence in polar coordinate of a vector field $v(r,\theta)= (v_1, v_2)$ in my calculation is given by
$$ \text{div}(v) = \partial_r v_1 + \partial_\theta v_2$$ 
but there is also the formula of divergence in polar coordinate given by 
$$\text{div}(v)= \frac{1}{r}\partial_r (rv_1) + \frac{1}{r} \partial_\theta v_2.$$ I have a vague idea that in the second one, the directions of the vector field we are looking at are still in the Cartesian coordinate in terms of $(\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$ and $(-\sin\theta, \cos\theta)$. But this feels very unnatural to me, because with these $e_r$, $e_\theta$ instead of $\partial_r, \partial_\theta$, we do not have the formula $\tilde v = dh(v)$ Could you help me clarify this please. For Completeness, here is a sketch of the proof for the statement at the top, it is based on Liouville's theorem: The solution $\phi^t(x)$ of  $$\begin{cases} \dot y = v(y) \\ y(0) = x
 \end{cases}$$
  as a flow preserves measure $\rho dx$, $\int_D \rho dx = \int_{\phi^t(D)} \rho dx$ if and only if $\text{div}(\rho v) = 0$. So now it suffices to show that the solution to our new IVP after the change of variable $h(\phi^t(h^{-1}(w)))$ preserves the new volume $Jh^{-1} dw$, i.e. for each $K$ 
$$\int_K Jh^{-1} dw = \int_{h(\phi^t(h^{-1}(K)))} Jh^{-1} dw$$
and this is clear once we rewrite $K = h(h^{-1}(K))$ $$\int_{h(h^{-1}(K))} Jh^{-1} dw = \int_{h(\phi^t(h^{-1}(K)))} Jh^{-1} dw$$
which reduces to 
$$\int_{h^{-1}(K)} dw = \int_{\phi^t(h^{-1}(K))} dw$$
and this is true by our assumption $\text{div}(v) = 0$.","['divergence-operator', 'real-analysis', 'differential-geometry', 'calculus']"
2648027,Reflect a ray off a circle so it hits another point,"my problem is the following: I have two points ($e$ and $p$) in a 2D space and I am trying to figure out where on the circle is the reflection of $p$ as seen from $e$.
$$$$ $$$$
So the way I approached this is by looking for the vector from the center of the circle to the point, where the ray is reflected. [For simplicity the circle's center is located at $\color{darkturquoise}{(0,0)}$ and it has a radius with unit length. The two points are represented by the vectors $\color{deeppink}{e}$ and $\color{gold}{p}$] In the picture were looking for the vector $\color{red}{r}$, which coincides with the normal vector of the surface of the circle. So this vector has to fulfill 2 properties: $||\color{red}{r}|| = 1$ The angle between $\color{red}{r}$ and $\color{green}{p-r}$ should be equal to the angle between $\color{blue}{e-r}$ and $\color{red}{r}$. The equation for the fist property is pretty straight forward.
For the second property I came up with the following equation:
$$\Bigg|\Bigg|\frac{\color{blue}{e-r}}{||\color{blue}{e-r}||}\times\color{red}{r}\Bigg|\Bigg| = \Bigg|\Bigg|\color{red}{r}\times\frac{\color{green}{p-r}}{||\color{green}{p-r}||}\Bigg|\Bigg|\\
\frac{||(\color{blue}{e-r})\times\color{red}{r}||}{||\color{blue}{e-r}||} =\frac{||\color{red}{r}\times(\color{green}{p-r})||}{||\color{green}{p-r}||}\\
\frac{1}{||\color{blue}{e-r}||}\Big|\Big|(\color{deeppink}{e}\times\color{red}{r})-\big((-\color{red}{r})\times\color{red}{r}\big)\Big|\Big|=
\frac{1}{||\color{green}{p-r}||}\Big|\Big|(\color{red}{r}\times\color{gold}{p})-\big(\color{red}{r}\times(-\color{red}{r})\big)\Big|\Big|\\
\frac{||\color{deeppink}{e}\times\color{red}{r}||}{||\color{blue}{e-r}||}=
\frac{||\color{red}{r}\times\color{gold}{p}||}{||\color{green}{p-r}||}\\
\frac{||\color{green}{p-r}||}{||\color{blue}{e-r}||}=
\frac{||\color{red}{r}\times\color{gold}{p}||}{||\color{deeppink}{e}\times\color{red}{r}||}\\
\frac{\sqrt{1 + ||\color{deeppink}{e}||^{2} - 2(\color{red}{r}\cdot\color{pink}{e})}}{\sqrt{1 + ||\color{gold}{p}||^{2} - 2(\color{red}{r}\cdot\color{gold}{p})}}=
\frac{||\color{red}{r}\times\color{gold}{p}||}{||\color{deeppink}{e}\times\color{red}{r}||}
$$
After that I use the fact that the cross product of 2 2D-Vectors has a single non-zero value and it determines the length of that cross product.
$$
\frac{\sqrt{1 + ||\color{deeppink}{e}||^{2} - 2(\color{red}{r}_{1}\color{pink}{e}_{1} + \color{red}{r}_{2}\color{pink}{e}_{2})}}{\sqrt{1 + ||\color{gold}{p}||^{2} - 2(\color{red}{r}_{1}\color{gold}{p}_{1} + \color{red}{r}_{2}\color{gold}{p}_{2})}}=
\frac{\color{red}{r}_{1}\color{gold}{p}_{2}-\color{red}{r}_{2}\color{gold}{p}_{1}}{\color{deeppink}{e}_{1}\color{red}{r}_{2}-\color{deeppink}{e}_{2}\color{red}{r}_{1}}
$$
The left hand side is positive.
I want both angles to have equal signs, because they are both in the same general direction as $\color{red}{r}$. This means that the right hand side is also positive.
I square both sides to get rid of the roots on the left.
$$
\frac{1 + ||\color{deeppink}{e}||^{2} - 2(\color{red}{r}_{1}\color{deeppink}{e}_{1} + \color{red}{r}_{2}\color{pink}{e}_{2})}{1 + ||\color{gold}{p}||^{2} - 2(\color{red}{r}_{1}\color{gold}{p}_{1} + \color{red}{r}_{2}\color{gold}{p}_{2})}=
\frac{(\color{red}{r}_{1}\color{gold}{p}_{2}-\color{red}{r}_{2}\color{gold}{p}_{1})^{2}}{(\color{deeppink}{e}_{1}\color{red}{r}_{2}-\color{deeppink}{e}_{2}\color{red}{r}_{1})^{2}}
$$
And this is as far as I can get. I don't think substituting $p_{2}$ with $\sqrt{1-p_{1}^2}$ will get me anywhere and also avoid it, since I am going to use that in a graphic application and I am trying to make as few calculations as possible.$$$$

2648287,Is the definition of the binary operation of a group intrinsic to the set elements?,"I have a nagging, basic question as to the boundaries between elements in the set and composition rule (or operation) in the definition of a group : In mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element... For instance, in a finite cyclic group of order $n=4,$ i.e. $\mathbb Z_4=\{0,1,2,3\}$ the element $1$ moves all elements of the set by $1,$ while the element $2$ moves them by $2,$ etc. Now in the composition table, as an example, $1\;\circ\;3$ will move the elements first by $1,$ and later by $3,$ resulting in no move $(\mathbb Z/ 4\mathbb Z).$ The point being that the ""effect"" (I would like to say ""action"", but the word is taken to signify the action of a group on a set) of the binary operation is already somehow within the actual elements. In other words, the elements of the set are not inert or passive. They don't seem to be waiting for the definition of the operation - they carry with them a generating ""action"", which seems to overlap or preempt the role of the binary operation. At least in this example, they don't seem to be in need for an explicit definition of the composition rule. Up to what point are the elements ""active"", and already intrinsically containing the idea of the binary operation? Is the composition implicit in the set elements, relegating the composition table to a formalism? Or does it depend on the specific type of group? Another example: What else needs defining in the dihedral group $D_3$ when the elements are ""rotation"" and ""reflection"", that is $S=\{e,r,r^2,rf,r^2f\}?$ Please be lenient with terminological slights of hand to convey the conceptual problem.

2648331,How to find out the critical angle of a ball separating the circle?,"Question: Let function $x:\mathbf R_+\to[0,2\pi]$ satisfying the second-order nonlinear ODE

  where $0<\epsilon\ll1$ is a given constant. Suppose that there exist a $t_0\in\mathbf R_+$ such that ${\dot x(t_0)}^2=\cos x(t_0)$. Then how to find out the value $x(t_0)$? Actually the question arises from the following physical phenomenon: A small ball starts from the north pole of a large vertical circle with a sufficient small initial velocity, and then falls outside. For simplicity, we normalize all the coefficients like the gravitational acceleration, the radius of the circle and the friction factor, and neglect the size of the ball. Then it's easy to derive that the angle of the vertical line with the line connecting ball and center of circle satisfies the kinematic equation presented above, and the time $t_0$ is exactly the moment that the ball separates from the circle with critical angle $x(t_0)$. If the friction is not involved, then the equation of the angle degenerates into
$$\ddot x = \sin x,$$
and the question can be trivially solved by applying the first integral in the theory of ODEs. But how to solve the case that the friction is involved? That is, how to solve the general question described above analytically? The key difficulty is that the ODE in Question seems not to possess a first integral. I have no idea then...

Then $$f_1\left(\theta_n\right) = f_1(\theta_0) + \nabla f_1\left(\theta_0\right)(\theta_n - \theta_0) + (\theta_n - \theta_0)^T H_1(\theta') (\theta_n - \theta_0) $$ $$f_2\left(\theta_n\right) = f_2(\theta_0) + \nabla f_2\left(\theta_0\right)(\theta_n - \theta_0) + (\theta_n - \theta_0)^T H_2(\theta') (\theta_n - \theta_0) $$ If I try to put this in matrix form, I will get something like $$f\left(\theta_0\right) = f(\theta_0) + \begin{pmatrix} \nabla f_1(\theta_0)\\ \nabla f_2(\theta_0)\end{pmatrix} (\theta_n - \theta_0) + ???$$","['real-analysis', 'taylor-expansion']"

2648760,Proof that every group of order 4 is abelian,"I know there are questions on this already but I wanted to check if my attempt at proving it was valid, and I couldn't find anyone else presenting the same one in any other post. My attempt is as follows: Since there must be a unique identity, and a unique inverse for each element, I believe that without loss of generality I can let the group be $G = \{e, a, a^{-1}, b\}$ where $e$ is the identity and $a,b$ are some other elements not equal to $e$. Then by a previous result we know that the identity element is commutative and that an element and its inverse commute with each other. This tells us that $e.x=x.e$ for all $x$ in G, and that $a.a^{-1}=a^{-1}.a$. This leaves only $a.b$ and $a^{-1}.b$ to check. One of $a$ or $a^{-1}$ must be an inverse for $b$ and since $a,a^{-1}$ are arbitrary, say it is $a$. Then we have $a.b=b.a$. If we multiply both sides of this equality by $a^{-1}$ on the left and right we are left with $b.a^{-1}=a^{-1}.b$ which is the final possibility. We have shown that all elements in $G$ commute with each other so $G$ is abelian. I know this proof relies on some other results which of course must be proven too but I know how to proof these, so given these are previously proven is this proof valid?","['finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'proof-verification', 'abelian-groups', 'group-theory']"

(a) By equating imaginary parts in DeMoivre's Formula prove that
$$\sin {n\theta} = \sin^n\theta \left\lbrace \binom{n}{1} \cot^{n - 1}\theta - \binom{n}{3} \cot^{n - 3}\theta + \binom{n}{5} \cot^{n - 5}\theta - + \cdots \right\rbrace$$
(b) If $0 < \theta < \dfrac{\pi}{2}$, prove that
$$\sin{\left( 2m + 1 \right)\theta} = \sin^{2m+1}\theta . P_m\left( \cot^2 \theta \right)$$
where $P_m$ is the polynomial of degree $m$ given by
$$P_m(x) = \binom{2m + 1}{1} x^m - \binom{2m + 1}{3} x^{m - 1} + \binom{2m + 1}{5} x^{m - 2} - + \cdots$$
Use this to show that $P_m$ has zeros at $m$ distinct points $x_k = \cot^2 \left( \dfrac{k\pi}{2m + 1} \right)$ for $k = 1, 2, \dots, m$.
(c) Show that the sum of zeros of $P_m$ is given by
$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{m} \cot^2 \dfrac{k\pi}{2m + 1} = \dfrac{m \left( 2m - 1 \right)}{3}$$
and that the sum of there squares is given by
$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{m} \cot^4 \dfrac{k\pi}{2m + 1} = \dfrac{m\left( 2m - 1 \right) \left( 4m^2 + 10m - 9 \right)}{45}$$ Prove that $z^n - 1 = \prod\limits_{k = 1}^{n} \left( z - e^{\dfrac{2ki\pi}{n}} \right)$ for all complex $z$. Use this to derive the formula

But, in the second question, proving the zeros and their sum (and the sum of their squares) is getting really difficult. I am not getting any sort of hint as to how to prove it further. And for the second question, I could do the first half part since it was essentially finding the $n$ roots of unity. But for the second part, I have nearly proved everything but what was asked. Many times I came to the conclusion that $$\prod\limits_{k = 1}^{n} \sin \dfrac{k\pi}{n} = 0$$ which is obvious because at $k = n$, we have a term of $\sin \pi$ which is equal to $0$.

I know that this must be true by some basic abstract algebra as the signum of a permutation is given by $(-1)^{\textrm{number of inversion}}$ and $|A_n : S_n| = 2$, and as the above sum counts exactly all permutations it must vanish. But this argument I think is to advanced, so I am looking for an more elemetary one. For example, if $n$ is odd, then $\binom{n}{2}$ is odd too, and with $I_{n,k} = I_{n, \binom{n}{2}-k}$ (which is also part of the exercise)
it easy to see that this sum cancels, but this does not work if $n$ is even.","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

2649103,When can an infinite matrix have uniformly bounded rows and columns in $\ell^2$ but not be bounded on $\ell^2$.,"There is a famous result by Schur, which tells us that if we define an operator $A$ on $\ell^2$ by setting $\langle A e_i,e_j\rangle=a_{ij}$ such that $\sup_j\lVert a_{ij}\rVert_{\ell^1_i}=\alpha$ and $\sup_i\lVert a_{ij}\rVert_{\ell^1_j}=\beta$ are both finite, then $A\in\mathscr{L}(\ell^2)$ is a bounded operator, with operator norm $\lVert A\rVert_{\mathscr{L}(\ell^2)}\le\sqrt{\alpha\beta}$. Presumably, we cannot relax this condition by requiring an $\ell^2$-bound on the rows and columns and still expect $A$ to be a bounded operator. However, I have yet to find an example of how this may fail. Is there any such example that is easy to construct? Furthermore, is a uniform $\ell^1$ bound the best we can do?

2649340,Laplace transform of hitting time of Brownian motion with drift,"I have the process $X_t = W_t + \mu t$ where $W_t$ is Brownian motion and $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$. I also have the hitting time
$$\tau = \inf\{t\geq 0: X_t = a \text{ or } X_t = b \}$$
where $a < 0 < b$. I want to compute $E[e^{-\lambda\tau}]$ for arbitrary $\lambda > 0$. I suppose one way to do that is switch to the measure under which $X_t$ is Brownian motion but that would lead to an integral involving the joint distribution of Brownian motion, its running maximum and minimum. I want to avoid that path and instead find a martingale-based technique. Following the technique in a similar case where the hitting time is defined in terms of a single boundary (not two), I defined
$$M_t := e^{\theta X_t - \lambda t}$$
for $\theta$ chosen to make $M$ a martingale. This function turned out to be not restrictive enough for my purposes as it only got me so far as to compute the probability that one boundary is hit before the other. Then, I looked at the case where hitting time is defined in terms of two boundaries for Brownian motion with no drift. In that case, the martingale to work with is
$$M_t = f(t)\cosh\left(\theta W_t - \theta\frac{a+b}{2}\right)$$
for some $f(t)$ chosen to make $M$ a martingale. Unfortunately, defining $$M_t = f(t)\cosh\left(\theta X_t - \theta\frac{a+b}{2}\right)$$ does not get me far as this cannot be a martingale by any choice of a deterministic function $f$. So it seems like what I need is some function that only contains $X$ (and some constants) and evaluates to the same known value at both boundaries. Furthermore, this function should probably be monotonic (or bounded) so that I can apply an appropriate convergence theorem. I can multiply this function by another deterministic function (or add them together but nothing too involved) to make the resulting process a martingale. This is where I am at. Any tips on how to proceed from this point on or different approaches are appreciated. I think I have found the process to work with. I define
$$M_t = f(t)e^{\mu X_t}\sinh\left(\theta X_t - \alpha\right)$$ I can make $M$ a martingale by a suitable choice of $\theta$ and $f$. By choosing $\alpha$ appropriately I can make it behave nicely at the barriers.

2649741,Visualize ideals in number fields,"Let $K$ be a field extension of degree $n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. We know that the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module of rank $n$, and so is any fractional ideal $I$ in $K$. These are examples of lattices in $K$, which are by definition the $\mathbb{Z}$-span of a basis of $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. I would like to fully understand the geometric picture that we get from these lattices. In some cases I think I have, but in others I am not very sure how to picture things. I couldn't find any good reference on the literature, and I also didn't find any related question on stack exchange (I only found this less general question, but it does not address the full problem I am trying to understand). Example: If $\alpha_{1},\ldots, \alpha_{n}\in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a basis of $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\alpha_{1}^{\vee},\ldots,\alpha_{n}^{\vee}\in K$ is the dual basis with respect to the trace pairing. Let $M=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{Z}\alpha_{i}$ and $M^{\vee}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\mathbb{Z}\alpha_{i}^{\vee}$. Then, since any $x\in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ can be written as
$$ x=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\text{Tr}_{K/ \mathbb{Q} }(x\alpha_{i})\alpha_{i}^{\vee}$$ we have that $M\subseteq M^{\vee}$. Moreover, we can use the geometric picture with the lattices to compute the cardinality of the quotient $M^{\vee} / M$. Visualize $M^{\vee}$ as a grid in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (up to coordinate change, we may assume $\alpha_{i}^{\vee} = e_{i}$). Then $M$ is a subgrid and the cardinality of the quotient is the number of times we can fit the fundamental mesh of the finer grid into the one of the coarser grid. Since we did that coordinate change and our finer fundamental mesh is just the unit cube, the caridnality of the quotient is just the volume of the fundamental mesh of the grid given by $M$. By an elementary argument of integral calculus, this is just the determinant of the matrix of base chagne. By the previous formula, this is precisely $$ | \det(\text{Tr}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j})) |$$ My problem: (see EDIT below) I want to see that the norm of an ideal $I\subseteq \mathcal{O}_{K}$ is the number of times that the fundamental mesh of the grid corresponding to $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ fits into the subgrid defined by $I$. I tried to carry on similar arguments as in the example but I couldn't figure out how. In particular, one of my main problems is the following: Given the generator(s) of an ideal $I\subseteq \mathcal{O}_{K}$, how can I know what is its corresponding subgrid? My attempt: (see EDIT below) If $\mathcal{O}_{K}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{Z}\alpha_{i}$ and $0\neq x\in I$ has integral equation $x^{n}+a_{1}x^{n-1}+\ldots +a_{0}=0$, then $a_{0}\in I\cap \mathbb{Z}$ and we have
$$ \sum^{n}_{i=1}\mathbb{Z}a_{0}\alpha_{i} \subseteq I \subseteq \mathcal{O}_{K} $$ In particular, if $I=\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ above the prime $p$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, then the grid of $I$ contains the grid with fundamental mesh $[0,p]^{n}$ (if we again see $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ as $\mathbb{Z}^{n}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$). But this won't be an equality unless $p$ is inert in $K$, right? This brought me to the following question: If $p\mathcal{O}_{K}=\mathfrak{p}_{1}^{e_{1}}\cdots \mathfrak{p}_{g}^{e_{g}}$, is the fundamental mesh of $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ covered like a puzzle by those of the primes in the factorization? Any help/reference is appreciated! EDIT Thanks to the useful comment below, I realized that my hopes were wrong: the subgrid corresponding to the ideal is not always aligned with the grid of the ring of integers. But it is still possible to do a basechange to get this geometric interpretation of the norm. If $K$ has $r_{1}$ real embeddings and $r_{2}$ pairs of complex embeddings, then we can define a map $$ \lambda \colon K \to \mathbb{R}^{r_{1}+2r_{2}}=\mathbb{R}^{n} $$ given by $x \mapsto (\sigma_{1}(x),\ldots, \sigma_{r_{1}}(x),\text{Re}(\sigma_{r_{1}+2}(x)),\text{Im}(\sigma_{r_{1}+2}(x)), \ldots, \text{Re}(\sigma_{r_{1}+2r_{2}}(x)),\text{Im}(\sigma_{r_{1}+2r_{2}}))$. With this definition, the following equality holds $$\text{Vol}(\mathbb{R}^{n}/\lambda(I))=\frac{1}{2^{r_{2}}}\sqrt{|\text{disc}_{K}|}N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(I) $$ and we get the desired geometric interpretation. But I still couldn't figure out the answer to the second question. Is ramification also possible to picture in this lattice way with some appropiate base change?

Since $X$ is not $\sigma$-finite in $\mu$, $(L^1)^* \neq L^{\infty}$. The proof is as follow: Let $g(x)=x$ which is not measurable. Let $\Lambda f=\int fg d\mu$ for all $f\in L^1$, the integration here makes sense since we can prove $fg$ is measurable. We check that $\|\Lambda \|\leq1$ hence $\Lambda $ is a linear bounded functional. Suppose there is $h \in L^{\infty}$ such that $\Lambda f=\int fh d\mu=\int fg d\mu$, then we can choose some special $f$ to obtain $h=g$ a.e.. Thus we have a contradiction here since $h$ is measurable but $g$ is not. 2 Let $(X,\mu,M)$ be a measure space with $X=[0,1]$, $\mu$=Lebesgue measure.

Thus, by Hahn-Banach theorem, there is $\Lambda \in (L^{\infty})^*$ such that $\Lambda =0$ on $C(X)$ and $\Lambda \neq 0$ in $L^{\infty}$. Suppose there is $g\in L^1$ such that $\Lambda f= \int fgd\mu $. But $\Lambda f= \int fgd\mu=0 $ for all $f \in C(X)$, we can prove that $g=0$ which implies $\Lambda = 0$ contradicts to $\Lambda \neq 0$ in $L^{\infty}$. In both of the proof, it seems that they assume that the space $X$ is the dual of $Y$ if and only if they have a Riesz representation. But I am not sure if it is true. The above proof shows that the map $g \mapsto \Lambda$ by $\Phi(g)=\Lambda_g(f)=\int fg d\mu$ is not a isometry (not onto). But it does not mean that there exist no other isometry between the space.","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'lp-spaces', 'measure-theory']"

2650300,Bihomogeneous Nullstellensatz,"I'm reading 'Arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay Sets of Points in $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$ ' by Elena Guardo and Adam Van Tuyl. (One can read it partially on Google books .) I doubt whether the 'Bigraded Nullstellensatz' is true or not; they say: Theorem 2.11　(Bigraded Nullstellensatz) If $I\subset R=k[x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2]$ is a bihomogeneous ideal and if $F\in R$ is a bihomogeneous polynomial with $\deg F\neq (0,0)$ such that $F(P)=0$ for all $P\in V(I)\subset \mathbb P^1\times \mathbb P^1$ ,
  then $F^t\in I$ for some $t>0$ . ( $k$ is an algebraically closed field.) Here by a bihomogeneous polynomial they mean a polynomial F which is a homogeneous polynomial in $x_1,x_2$ (resp. $y_1,y_2$ ) with coefficients in $k[y_1,y_2]$ (resp. $k[x_1,x_2]$ ). A bihomogeneous ideal is an ideal in $k[x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2]$ generated by bihomogeneous polynomials. (Equivalently, one can define it to be an ideal I with the following condition: If $F=\sum F_{p,q}\in I$ , where $F_{p,q}$ is a bihomogeneous polynomial of degree $(p,q)$ , then each $F_{p,q}$ belongs to $I$ .) They don't give a proof in the textbook; they say the proof is the same as in the homogeneous case. (In the homogeneous case one must assume that $V(I)\neq \emptyset$ , but this is a trivial matter.) I've tried to prove it, but I can't. After the long grappling, I perhaps found a counterexample. Let $I=(x_1 y_1 ,x_1 y_2)$ . Then $I$ is bihomogeneous and $$V(I) = \{[0:1]\}\times \mathbb P^1.$$ Thus $x_1 \in I(V(I))$ , i.e., $x_1$ vanishes on $V(I)$ . However, any powers of $x_1$ are not in I . Is there something wrong?

\int_{0}^{\pi} \int_{u = 0}^{u= A \sin\theta} f(\theta, u)\,\mathrm{d}u \,\mathrm{d}\theta ~,\qquad 0 < A<1,\qquad f(\theta,u)\equiv \bigl(1 - \cos 2\theta \bigr) \Bigl(1 + \cos\bigl(\frac{\theta + 2 \pi u}2 \bigr)\Bigr)
$$ The region of integration is the ""hump"" under the sine curve with amplitude $A$. Note that $f(\theta,u)$ is asymmetric (either mirror or rotational) within $0<\theta<\pi$. Nonetheless, it is rotationally symmetric $f(2\pi - \theta, 1- u) = f(\theta,u)$ if one considers twice the integral by extending the domain of $\theta$. The figures below display the integrand as the yellow surface (front and back view). The sine hump region of integration is enclosed by the blue wall, and outside the region is dimmed. The top row is $f(\theta, u)$ itself, the middle row is for region $A = 9/10$, and the bottom row is $A = 1/4$. My Questions Can this deceivingly simple-looking integral be evaluated to a closed form as a function of $A$? Regardless of (1), is this integral related to some ""named"" integral or special functions? My Failed Attempts So Far This is a 2-dim region so the basic two ways are ""vertical first"" and ""horizontal first"". Doing vertical first $\int \mathrm{d}u$ for $u = 0$ to $u = A \sin\theta$ yields a nested sine $\sin\bigl( \frac{\theta}2 + A \pi \sin\theta\bigr)$. It doesn't take long for my Mathematica to declare that this cannot be evaluated (returning the input as is after 50 sec). Doing horizontal first $\int \mathrm{d}\theta$ for $\theta = \theta_u$ to $u = \pi - \theta_u$, where $\theta_u \equiv \arcsin(\frac{u}A)$, produces many terms like $\sin\bigl( \pi u + \frac{\theta_u}2 \bigr)$ which I don't know how to handle. My Mathematica churned out something (after about 3 min) with many complex (imaginary) terms and a lot of Erf function (antiderivative of Gaussian). On the coding side, I tried ComplexExpand with FullSimplify etc but it just got worse (over 30 thousand terms) and less comprehensible. So far I don't have any good ideas for change of variables.

2650430,Get the solution to the differential equation $\cos y \sin2x dx +(cos^2y - cos^2x)dy = 0$,"I was helping somebody on some math problems when a wild question appears. It goes like this: Get the solution to the differential equation $$\cos y \sin2x dx +(\cos^2y - \cos^2x)dy = 0$$ My work I was able to search the internet on how to get the solution to the differential equation shown above but I do not understand the way. We could perhaps rearrange the above differential equation into the form $$M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0$$ With the form above, we could see if the given differential equation is variable-separable, homogenous or an exact-type. Testing the given differential equation as variable-separable: No. We can't. The differential equation above isn't variable-separable. Testing the given differential equation as homogenous: $F(x,y)$ is a homogenous function of degree $n$ in $x$ and $y$ provided $F(kx,ky)$ = $k^nF(x,y)$. For example, $x^2 + y^2$ and $x^2 \sin \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$ are homogenous functions of degree $2$ in $x$ and $y$. With that in mind... Looking at the first term $\cos y \sin2x$:
$$F(x,y) = \cos y \sin2x$$
$$F(kx,ky) = \cos (ky) \sin(2kx)$$
Getting deeper, we conclude that
$$F(kx,ky) \neq k^nF(x,y)$$ Looking at the second term $\cos^2y - \cos^2x$:
$$F(x,y) = \cos^2y - \cos^2x$$
$$F(kx,ky) = \cos^2(ky) - \cos^2(kx)$$
Getting deeper, we conclude that
$$F(kx,ky) \neq k^nF(x,y)$$ The terms themselves must be homogenous if the differential equations are homogenous. No. We can't. The differential equation above isn't homogenous. Testing the given differential equation if it is an exact-type: A necessary condition for a differential equation to be exact is $$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$$ So getting the expression for $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}$: $$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(\cos y \sin2x) $$
$$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \sin 2x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(\cos y) $$
$$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \sin 2x(-\sin y)$$
$$\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = -\sin y \sin 2x$$ So getting the expression for $\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$: $$\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\cos^2y - \cos^2x) $$
$$\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = 0 - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\cos^2x) $$
$$\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = 0 - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\cos 2x\right) $$
$$\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = \sin 2x $$ We see that $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} \neq \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$, so the given differential equation isn't exact either. Let's try converting it into linear differential equation. Let's try rearranging the given differential equation above into a Bernoulli equation, having the form $$\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)$$
Then... $$\cos y \sin2x dx +(\cos^2y - \cos^2x)dy = 0$$
$$\frac{\cos y \sin2x dx}{dx} +\frac{(\cos^2y - \cos^2x)dy}{dx} = \frac{0}{dx}$$
$$\cos y \sin2x + (\cos^2y - \cos^2x)\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$
$$\frac{\cos y \sin2x}{\cos^2y - \cos^2x} + \frac{\cos^2y - \cos^2x}{\cos^2y - \cos^2x}\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{0}{\cos^2y - \cos^2x}$$
$$\frac{\cos y \sin2x}{\cos^2y - \cos^2x} + \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$
$$\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{\cos y \sin2x}{\cos^2y - \cos^2x} = 0$$ Screw that. We couldn't even discern what is the expression of $P(x)y$ because the expression $\frac{\cos y \sin2x}{\cos^2y - \cos^2x}$ is irreducible. We can't separate $x$'s from $y$'s.

2650706,"Compute a measure of ""near multiplicity"" from a list of noisy values","Question I posted this question on StackOverflow before but someone advised me to ask it there because it looks like a numerical algorithm problem. Let us say I've got a list of values which have a common multiple greater than 1. For example, let us take the multiple to be 3 and form a collection of multiples of this value: harmonicList = [3,6,6,3,3,9,27,3,15,18,9] Now I add some noise: harmonicList = [ v + (random() * 2 - 1 ) * 0.1 for v in harmonicList] I'm searching for an algorithm that will return a number near 1.0 when the items in the list are near to being multiples of a common value but near 0.0 when the numbers are not near to being multiples -- such as, for example when the list is a collection of prime numbers. Is there such a measure of ""near multiplicity""? Why I want to solve this problem I'm currently trying to detect Chessboard in a screenshot using Hough Transform. Sometimes the case is ideal, and it works very well : But sometimes not : I would like to detect the cases where there is a lot of aberrations. Thus, my idea is to compute the intersections of the lines detected, and create a collection of length  (only if the lines where horizontal or vertical). If the detection was good, I know that there will be a great ""harmonicity"" inside this collection I can then use that algorithm and a threshold.",['statistics']
2650721,Compactness gives Second countable space??,"Suppose that $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space. If we know that $X$ is compact can we assume that is also second countable ?? Because X is compact we have that $X=\cup_{i=1}^{n}V_{i}$ , where $V_{i}$ are open sets. So for every $U\subset X$ we have that $U\subset \cup_{i=1}^{n}V_{i}$ . Can we assume that by choosing some of the $V_{i}$ we will have that $U=\cup_{i\in J}V_{i}$ , $J$ is countable. In order for $(X,\mathcal{T})$ to have a countable topology base ??","['general-topology', 'examples-counterexamples', 'compactness', 'second-countable']"
2650748,Is the condition sufficient?,"I am stuck on the following problem: Let $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous and $2\pi$-periodic and $n$ be a positive integer. If for any integer $p \in [0,n-1]$,
$$\int_{0}^{2\pi} f(t) \cos(pt)\,\mathrm{d}t=\int_{0}^{2\pi} f(t) \sin(pt)\,\mathrm{d}t=0,$$ then is it true that $f$ has at least $2n$ roots on $[0,2\pi]$? I tried to prove the problem using induction. $p=0$ is easy , but $p=1$ is giving me a hard time. Edit: After the comment of Dear Dunham , it's seems that we need both integral to be equal to zero , in other to work , in that case  we have the form : 
$$ \int_{0}^{2\pi} f(t) e^{ipt} \mathrm{d}t=0$$   , 
Now it looks like the trigonometric version of Prove that $f$ has $m+1$ zeros if $\int_{a}^{b} x^nf(x)dx=0$ for all $n\le m$ Edit: I made some progress with the new version of the question in the case $f$ is not identicaly $0$ , and proved $M \geq n$ , where $M$ is the number of zeros of $f$ as follow : Let $(T_{n})$ the sequence of Tchebychev polynomial , $\cos(nt)=T_{n}(\cos(t))$ and $\deg(T_{n})=n$ . hence $(T_{0},...,T_{n-1})$ is a basis of $R_{n-1}[X]$ ,$0\leq a_{1}<a_{2}<... <a_{m}\leq \pi \leq a_{m+1}<..<a_{p}$ the zeros of $f$ and suppose that $p\leq n-1$  . For $i \in [1,m-1]$ such that $a_{i}<x<a_{i+1}$ since cosinus is decreasing in  $[0,\pi[$ then $b_{i+1}=\cos(a_{i+1}) < \cos(x) < b_{i}=\cos(a_{i})$  , on the other hand, for $j \in [m ,p-1]$ we have $c_{j}=\cos(a_{j}) < \cos(x) < c_{j+1}=\cos(a_{j+1})$  since here cosine is increasing in $[\pi ,2 \pi]$. 
We have then $(d_{n})$ constructed from $(b_{n})$ and $(c_{n})$ such that :  $\forall x \in [0,2\pi]-J :  f(x)  \Pi_{i=1}^{p} (\cos(x)-d_{i}) > 0$ where 
$J=\{a_{1},a_{2},....,a_{p}, d_{1},...,d_{p}\}$ , the polynomial $P(x)=\Pi_{i=1}^{p}(x-d_{i})$ is of degree at most $n-1$ , hence we have $(t_{i})$ such that:  $P(\cos(t))=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} t_{i}T_{i}(\cos(t))$ by linearity of the integral, we conclude that : $\int_{0}^{2\pi} f(t)P(t)=0$ hence $f(x)=0$ For any  $x \in [0,2\pi]-J$ , hence by continuity $f=0$ every where, contradiction . I feel that I can improve this solution , by a better choice of the sequence of polynomial , one that also include the orthoganility with the familly $\sin(pt)$ $p \in [[0,n-1]]$ this information is critical to improve the bound , any help ? thank you a lot .","['real-analysis', 'integration', 'periodic-functions']"
2650771,Why is vertical distance the standard in least squares?,"When fitting a curve in $\mathbb R^2$ to data points in $\mathbb R^2$ ( example ), why is each point's vertical distance from the curve squared instead of its shortest (possibly diagonal) distance from the curve? Ignoring my poorly drawn curves, it seems obvious that is a worse curve-to-point fit than even though the red line is shorter in the first image, because you can draw the much shorter blue line instead (which I labeled b in the second image).  Minimizing $b^2$ seems much more important than minimizing $a^2$.","['intuition', 'least-squares', 'statistics', 'geometry', 'linear-algebra']"
2650774,How do I find a Gauss map and what should it look like?,"So the problem says to compute the gauss map and it's derivative for the cone parametrized by 
$$\mathbf x (u,v)=(v\cos u, v\sin u, v).$$ From what I understand, a Gauss map takes the unit normal vectors of this cone and maps them into the unit sphere in order to give geometric meaning to the equation by examining the shape traced on the sphere by the normal vectors of the cone.
What I don't understand is what this should look like. It seems to me that the Gauss map should just be the equation for the unit normal vector, which I found like this: $$\begin{split} \mathbf x_u&= (-v\sin u, v\cos u, 0)\\
\mathbf x_v&= (\cos u, \sin u, 1)\\
U &= \frac{\mathbf x_u \times \mathbf x_v}{|\mathbf x_u \times \mathbf x_v|}\\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(\cos u,\sin u,-1).
\end{split}$$ But I'm not sure how I should state my answer. Should it be $f(u,v)= \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(\cos u,\sin u,-1)$? And for finding the derivative of the Gauss map, also called the second fundamental form, I know this is equal to the negative of the shape operator. This I am also a bit confused about. Here is what I know about the shape operator: I think this should look like a matrix $S$ so that if: $$\begin{split}
S(\mathbf x_u)&= a\mathbf x_u + b\mathbf x_v\\
S(\mathbf x_v)&=c\mathbf x_u + d\mathbf x_v.
\end{split}$$ then $$S= 
\left(
    \begin{matrix}
    a & c \\
    b & d \\
    \end{matrix}\right)
$$ And using $$E=\mathbf x_u \cdot\mathbf x_u = v^2, \ \ F= \mathbf x_u \cdot\mathbf x_v = 0, \ \ \ G= \mathbf x_v\cdot\mathbf x_v = 2.$$ $$l= \mathbf x_{uu}\cdot U = -\frac{v}{\sqrt 2},\ \ m= \mathbf x_{uv}\cdot U = 
 \mathbf x_{vu}\cdot U  = 0,\ \ n= \mathbf  x_{vv}\cdot U = 0.$$ I can find
$$
\begin{split} 
a&=-\frac{ Fm - Gl }{ EG - F^2 } = -\frac{1}{v\sqrt2}\\
b&=-\frac{ Fl + Em }{ EG - F^2 } = 0 \\
c&= -\frac{ -mG + Fn }{ EG - F^2 } = 0\\
d&= \frac{ En - Fm }{ EG - F^2 } = 0.
\end{split}$$ so the derivative of the gauss map is $$\left(
    \begin{matrix}
    -\frac{1}{v\sqrt2} & 0 \\
    0 & 0 \\
    \end{matrix}\right)
$$ Am I on the right path? Any insight would be appreciated.","['submanifold', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
