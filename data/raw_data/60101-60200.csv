Let $Q \subset P$ be a principal subbundle with fiber $H$, where $H \leq G$ is a (let's say closed and connected) Lie subgroup. Question: Suppose that $D$ restricts to a principal connection on $Q$.  Does it follow that $\text{Hol}(D)$ is a subgroup of $H$? As usual, this is not a homework question, but simply me trying to better organize my understanding.

669487,Prove that the product of some numbers between perfect squares is $2k^2$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : product is twice a square (2 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Here's a question I've recently come up with: Prove that for every natural $x$, we can find arbitrary number of integers in the interval
  $[x^2,(x+1)^2]$ so that their product is in the form of $2k^2$. I've tried several methods on proving this, but non of them actually worked. I know, for example, that the prime numbers shouldn't be in the product. I was also looking for numbers $x$ so that between $x^2$ and $(x+1)^2$ there is actually the number $2k^2$ for some natural $k$. If we find all of these numbers, then we should prove the case only for the numbers which are not in this form. These $x$s have this property: $x^2<2k^2<(x+1)^2$ leading to $x<k\sqrt 2<x+1$ and $x\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}<k<(x+1)\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}$. This means there should be a natural number between $x\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}$ and $(x+1)\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}$. I've checked some of the numbers that aren't like that with computer, and they were: $3,6,10,13,17,...$. the thing i noticed was that the difference between the two consecutive numbers of that form, is either $3$ or $4$. I think this has something to do with the binary representation of $\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}$ but I don't know how to connect it with that.

669567,Prove $\ell_1$ is complete,"I try to prove that $\ell_1$, the space of absolutely convergent sequences in $\mathbb{C}$ with norm $\| x \| = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_k|$, is complete.
I already proved that, if $\{ x_n \}$ is a Cauchy sequence (with elements in $\ell_1$), then, for a fixed $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the sequence $\{ x_{n,k} \}$ is Cauchy in $\mathbb{C}$. The obvious way to define a limit of a Cauchy sequence $\{ x_n \}$ is to take the limits of $\{ x_{n,k}\}$, which exist since $\mathbb{C}$ is complete. Let's call this sequence $x$.
But now we only know $x_n \to x$ pointwise. Problem: how do I prove $\lim_{n \to \infty} \| x_n - x \| = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n,k} - x_k| = 0$? I suppose I need to use the absolute convergence of $x_n$, but I do not see how. If I can prove the above, it follows that $x \in \ell_1$ therefore $\ell_1$ is complete. Edit: Knowing $x \in \ell_1$, to establish convergence, I know (for $n,m>N$) $\sum_{k=1}^K |x_{m,k} − x_{n,k} | \leq \|x_m−x_n\| < \epsilon$. I let $m \to \infty$, can I conclude $\sum_{k=1}^K |x_k − x_{n,k}| \leq \| x−x_n \| < \epsilon$? That seems odd. But so does $\sum^K_{k=1} | x_k − x_{n,k} | \leq \| x_m − x_n \|$.

Here is the homework problem for my course. Let $V \subset k^n$ and $W \subset k^m$ be two affine varieties, and let $$\begin{aligned}
V \times W &= \{(x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m) \in k^{n + m}|\\&\quad(x_1, \dots x_n) \in k^n, (y_1, \dots y_m) \in k^m\}

Hint: If $V$ is defined by $f_1, \dots, f_s \in k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, then we can regard $f_1, \dots, f_s$ as polynomials in $k[x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m]$, and similarly for $W$.  Show that this gives defining equations for the cartesian product. My Attempt Assume that $V \subset k^n$ and $W \subset k^m$ are affine varieties.  That is:
$$\begin{aligned}

W &= \{(y_1, \dots, y_m) \in k^m |g_1=g_2=\cdots=g_t = 0 \}

\end{aligned}$$ Using the hint for this problem, we have the following: If $V$ is defined by $f_1, \dots, f_s \in k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, then we can regard $f_1, \dots, f_s$ as polynomials in $k[x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m]$ Likewise, if $W$ is defined by $g_1, \dots, g_t \in k[y_1, \dots, y_m]$, then we can regard $g_1, \dots, g_t$ as polynomials in $k[x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m]$ I am not sure what to claim for this problem (e.g. for $V \cup W$, we claim $V \cup W = \mathbf{V}(f_ig_i : 1 \leq i \leq s, 1 \leq i \leq t)$), so I go on and write what I understand about this problem... Set $(x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m) \in (V \times W)$, where $(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in V$ and $(y_1, \dots, y_m) \in W$.  Then, at the same time $f_1, \dots, f_s$ vanish at $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ and $g_1, \dots, g_t$ vanish at $(y_1, \dots, y_m)$. For the next step, I thought for around hours or so and then gave the following try: Since $f_1, \dots, f_s \in k[x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m]$, and $f_1, \dots, f_s$ vanish at $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$, the set of those polynomials also vanish at $(x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m)$.  Likewise, since $g_1, \dots, g_t \in k[x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m]$ and $g_1, \dots, g_t$ vanish at $(y_1, \dots, y_m)$, the set of those polynomials also vanish at $(x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m)$.  So $f_ig_j$ for $1 \leq i \leq s$ and $1 \leq j \leq t$ vanish at $(x_1, \dots, x_n, y_1, \dots, y_m)$. I think my proof needs a bit of adjustment or extra reasoning, but I'm not sure about this.

$$F(x)=\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} f(t) dt=F(x)=\int_{a(x)}^{c} f(t)dt+\int_c^{b(x)} f(t) dt

669996,Oksendal SDE book mistake?,"I am reading through Oksendals SDEs. I think there may be a mistake in question 5.18b and I can not find an errata so I was looking for some confirmation. The problem concerns the following SDE $\mathrm{d}X_t = \kappa (\alpha - \log X_t)X_t\mathrm{d}t + \sigma X_t \mathrm{d}B_t,\;\;\;X_0 = x>0 $ There is a hint to change variables to $Y_t = \log X_t$. This gives the following SDE for $Y_t$ $\mathrm{d}Y_t = \kappa(\alpha - Y_t)\mathrm{d}t + \sigma \mathrm{d}B_t - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \mathrm{d}t$ This can be solved using an integrating factor $Y_t = Y_0 e^{-\kappa t}+(\alpha-\frac{1}{2\kappa}\sigma^2)(1-e^{-\kappa t})+\sigma e^{-\kappa t}\int_0^{t}e^{\kappa s}\mathrm{d}B_s$ Okay now part b wants us compute $E[X_t]$. For a fixed time all the terms in $Y_t$ but the  last one are constants hence $E[X_t] = E[\exp(Y_t)]\\
 = \exp(e^{-\kappa t }\ln x + (\alpha-\frac{1}{2\kappa}\sigma^2)(1-e^{-\kappa t}))E[\exp(\sigma e^{-\kappa t}\int_0^{t}e^{\kappa s}\mathrm{d}B_s)]$ Okay now it seems to me that the random variable $\sigma e^{-\kappa t}\int_0^{t}e^{\kappa s}\mathrm{d}B_s$ is normally distributed, since it is the limit of a sum of normally distributed random variables, I haven't rigorously proven this to myself but I do not think there is any subtlety that would mess things up. Clearly it must have mean $0$, and the variance can be computed using Ito isometry. If I do that I get that the variance is $E[(\sigma e^{-\kappa t}\int_0^{t}e^{\kappa s}\mathrm{d}B_s)^2]=\frac{\sigma^2(1-e^{-2\kappa t})}{2\kappa}$ Hence now the expectation term above becomes a moment generating function of a Gaussian with a known mean and variance, evaluated at $1$. It seems to me that this will give us $E[X_t] = \exp(e^{-\kappa t }\ln x + (\alpha-\frac{1}{2\kappa}\sigma^2)(1-e^{-\kappa t}))\exp(\frac{1}{2}\frac{\sigma^2(1-e^{-2\kappa t})}{2\kappa})\\
= \exp(e^{-\kappa t }\ln x + (\alpha-\frac{1}{2\kappa}\sigma^2)(1-e^{-\kappa t})+ \frac{\sigma^2(1-e^{-2\kappa t})}{4\kappa})$ The problem is that Oksendal wants us to prove that 
$E[X_t] = \exp(e^{-\kappa t }\ln x + (\alpha-\frac{1}{2\kappa}\sigma^2)(1-e^{-\kappa t})+ \frac{\sigma^2(1-e^{-2\kappa t})}{2\kappa})$ Is there a mistake in his answer or did I make a mistake somewhere?

670014,"If $X$ is a compact metric space, $Homeo(X)$ is second countable","I would like an easy way to show that if $X$ is a compact metric space, then the group $Homeo(X)$ of homeomorphisms of $X$ with the compact-open topology (or the topology of uniform convergence, they are the same in this case) is second countable. I have some ideas but I don't like them really much. My first idea was to construct the countable base. If $m$ and $n$ are fixed in $\mathbf{N}$, there is a finite number $M$ (resp $N$) of balls of radius $\frac{1}{m}$ (resp. $\frac{1}{n}$) which cover $X$. Then if for each of these balls of radius $\frac{1}{m}$, I choose one of radius $\frac{1}{n}$ (there are $N^M < +\infty$ possibilities), I can choose (if it exists) some $f \in Homeo(X)$ such that the center of each ball is sent in the chosen corresponding ball... Then if I take all the balls of $Homeo(X)$ centered in these $f$, and with a radius $\frac{1}{p}$ for $p \in \mathbf{N}$, this is countable and we could show that this forms a countable base of topology... But I actually also have to take an $f$ with some uniform convergence, so this idea is not a good idea :D Another way to do this is to cite some well-known results. It's easy to see that a compact metric space is second countable, and I have found some book that say ""It is well known that the space of continuous function from $X$ to $Y$ with the compact-open topology has a countable base when $X$ and $Y$ are locally compact and have countable base. I could use that result but I would like some references... (and this is perhaps a strong result for my easy case). I would like the reader of my text to be convinced that this result is true.

670235,Is the product of $\sigma$-algebras a tensor product in some sense?,"In the wikipedia page for product measures it says: Let $(X_{1},\Sigma _{1})$ and $(X_{2},\Sigma _{2})$ be two measurable spaces, that is, $\Sigma _{1}$ and $\Sigma _{2}$ are sigma algebras on $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ respectively, and let $\mu _{1}$ and $\mu _{2}$ be measures on these spaces. Denote by $\Sigma _{1}\otimes \Sigma _{2}$ the sigma algebra on the Cartesian product $X_{1}\times X_{2}$ generated by subsets of the form $B_{1}\times B_{2}$ , where $B_{1}\in \Sigma _{1}$ and $B_{2}\in \Sigma _{2}$ . This sigma algebra is called the tensor-product σ-algebra on the product space. A product measure $\mu _{1}\times \mu _{2}$ is defined to be a measure on the measurable space $(X_{1}\times X_{2},\Sigma _{1}\otimes \Sigma _{2})$ satisfying the property: $(\mu _{1}\times \mu _{2})(B_{1}\times B_{2})=\mu _{1}(B_{1})\mu_{2}(B_{2})$ for all $B_{1}\in \Sigma _{1},\ B_{2}\in \Sigma _{2}$ . a. I can see that the product of $\sigma$ -algebras is a categorical product; but is it correct to say that it is also a tensor product in some analogue to the tensor product in vector spaces? In which case how? And is there a universal property that expresses it as such? b. I don't see how to express the product of measures as a categorical product. Is it? Though tensor products are usually defined for vector spaces, its most generally defined for abelian groups : For $A$ and $B$ two abelian groups, their tensor product $A\otimes B$ is a new abelian group which is such that a group homomorphism $A\otimes B \rightarrow C$ is equivalently a bilinear map out of $A$ and $B$ . Then some evidence that we might be able to interpret the product of measures as a kind of 'tensor product' is that supposing $B_1$ and $B_1'$ are disjoint in $\Sigma_1$ , we have: $(\mu _{1}\times \mu _{2})((B_{1} \sqcup B_1')\times B_{2})=\mu _{1}(B_{1} \sqcup B_1')\mu_{2}(B_{2})=(\mu _{1}B_{1}+ \mu _{1}B_{1}') \times \mu_{2}B_{2}$ = $(\mu_1 \times \mu_2)(B_1,B_2)+(\mu_1 \times \mu_2)(B_1',B_2)$ That is it satisfies the bilinearity property for the tensor product for disjoint sets.","['category-theory', 'measure-theory']"

670293,What can we say about the kernel of $\phi: F_n \rightarrow S_k$,"Let $F_n$ denote the free group on $n$ generators and let $S_k$ denote the symmetric group on the integers $\{1,\dots, k\}$, and the action of homomorphism $\phi$ (as given in the title) on the generators of $F_n$ be known. Let $K_{\phi}$ denote the kernel. My question is two-fold. I've had GAP spit out a couple dozen random examples of such homomorphisms/kernels and in every case so far $K_{\phi}$ appears to be of infinite generation. Is this always the case? I can't imagine how it couldn't be if $\phi$ is chosen to be nontrivial (my reasoning is that, even if $\phi$ kills off all but one generator, so that $K_{\phi}$ is a subset of an infinite cyclic subgroup of $F_n$, $K_{\phi}$ is still not finitely generated, and if $\phi$ kills off fewer-than-all-but-one generators the complexity only increases) but I also can't see how I would begin a proof, unless my reasoning in the previous parenthetical is the proof strategy. (Supposing, though, that there is a counterexample, is there a way to tell from the presentation of $\phi$ whether or not $K_{\phi}$ is finitely-presented?) Can anything be said about the ""combinatorics"" of the embedding $\iota: K_{\phi} \hookrightarrow F_n$? (To clarify what I mean by this: Of course, if all the groups that arise as kernels in this way are on infinite generators then any two are isomorphic by Nielsen-Schrier, but even if two such arise from the same $F_n$, they're clearly not necessarily the same subgroup.) Edit: I seem to have forgotten or never learned something important--As James points out in a comment below, $K_{\phi}$ is a finite-index subgroup of a finitely-generated group, so it's necessarily finitely-generated by what I just learned is called Schreier's lemma. With that in mind, I think it's sensible to revise the first part of my question to ""What can we say about a generating set of $K_{\phi}$ given what we know about $\phi$?"" The second part of the question remains a question for the time being. I've given this the reference request tag in case there's a standard source on these topics that I should be familiar with.

This is my 5th attempt at learning the subject seriously, and I would like some advice, say in the form of answers to the following specific questions, thanks: Why is the solution space rarely specified?  Even in ODE theory, we need to say ""We are looking for solutions in the space of continuous functions."" (Or more usually $C^k$ where $k$ is the order of the DEQ, although vacuously no function with not enough smoothness could solve an ODE in the traditional sense.) Speaking of the traditional sense as opposed to distributional or whatever else exists in PDE theory (I've heard terms like ""weak solution""), how come none of this stuff showed up in ODE theory?  In $d=1$ are all distributions functions?  I am aware, without proof, of a result that says that all linear systems have a distributional solution if and only if it is, in some appropriate sense, a function, for $d=1$.  What about other systems?  Couldn't richer collections of solutions be obtained if we allowed distributions? In both PDE and ODE theory, I have noticed only half the problem is usually solved, in the sense that the authors usually take a given equation, and perform operations on it and end up at some ""solution.""  But this solution need not actually work, especially if noninvertible operations are used, such as the Fourier transform as it's defined on $L^1$.  In ODE theory, without allowing for the generalities in 2., it has usually been easy to verify a guessed solution indeed works.  Although it may not be as trivial, is this what authors are assuming in 3.?  Or is there some agreement among those in PDE theory that not all guessed solutions may actually work?","['partial-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"

I attempted it by taking the basis of the subspace U with Dim(m) and extending it to basis of V with Dim(n). Since mapping of all vectors of basis of W exists and taking the remaining m-n vectors as zero - we will get a linear map to an element that is in V by defining $T \in L(V,W)$ as: $T(a_1u_1 + ...+ a_mu_m+b_1v_1 + ...+b_nv_n)=a_1Su_1 + ...+a_mSu_m$ Then $Tu=Su \space  \forall u \in U$ What I dont get is this: 1) Please correct me if I'm wrong but a linear map on V should be defined for all elements of V.

Why does $\widetilde{GL}^+_n$ not admit finite-dimensional representations? I would be happy with a proof or a reference. This question is relevant in spin geometry. Normally, one uses $Spin_n$, which is the universal cover of $SO_n$ (if $n \geq 3$), and a finite-dimensional representation $\rho:Spin_n \to GL(V)$ to construct the spinor bundle of a Riemannian spin manifold $(M,g)$ with spin structure $\Theta^g: Spin^g M \to SO^g M$ via $\Sigma^g M := Spin^g \times _{\rho} V$. In texts like [1], the authors work with a topological spin structure $\widetilde{GL}^+ M \to GL^+ M$ up to the point where one has to construct the spinor bundle. I like this approach, which is why I would like to better understand why this part of the construction fails. Unfortunately, I do not know much about representation theory besides what is mentioned in [1].

670870,"Differentiability of $\mathrm{max}(x, y)$ at $x=y$","I am trying to figure out differentiability of $\mathrm{max}(x, y)$. Intuitively, it should not be differentiable at $x=y$, since it changes direction ""non-smoothly"" at those points. I can not, however, find a way to prove this algebraically.","['optimization', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
670872,"Given a matrix $A$, show that it is positive.","Show that
  $$A := \begin{bmatrix}7 & 2 & -4\\2 & 4 & -2\\-4 & -2 & 7 \end{bmatrix}$$
  is positive definite. Could this be proven by showing that each of the vectors of the standard basis gives a positive result, e.g.: $$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}7 & 2 & -4\\2 & 4 & -2\\-4 & -2  & 7 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} > 0.$$ The second part of the question asks me to diagonalize the matrix using an orthogonal matrix, which as I understand, is to use elementary matrices on the rows and columns of the matrix to get it to a diagonal form. Would it make a difference if Ifirstly only dealt with the rows and only afterward used the exact matrices only on the columns? Thanks for your time.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
670905,Invariance of the Haar measure -- upon inverses?,"To simplify, let's assume $\mu$ is an invariant Haar measure on a commutative locally compact group $G$. Then, this means that $\mu$ is invariant under translation $\mu(U)=\mu(aU)$. However, I noticed is that, for cases like $G=(\Bbb R, +)$, or $G=\Bbb R^*, \times)$, $\mu$, is also invariant, up to a minus, under inverses. Specifically: $$\begin{aligned}x\mapsto -x&&x\mapsto x^{-1}\\
dx\mapsto -dx&&\frac {dx} x \mapsto -\frac {dx} x\end{aligned}$$ This is pretty neat when we are integrating over some domain, because after taking the inverse on the integration variable, we can also get a second minus sign by swapping the limits of integration. Does this generalize to other locally compact groups?","['measure-theory', 'integration']"
