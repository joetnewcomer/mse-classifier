4674596,Describe $f(S)$ where S is the solution set of equation $\lfloor5\sin x\rfloor+\lfloor\cos x\rfloor+6=0$,"If $$\lfloor 5\sin x\rfloor+\lfloor \cos x\rfloor+6=0$$ then the solution set of range of $$f(x)=\sqrt{3}\cos x+\sin x$$ I tried solving this question by doing the following $5\sin x$ ranges from $[-5,5]$ So $\lfloor 5 \sin x\rfloor$ has the range $-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5$ . Similar logic for $\lfloor\cos x\rfloor$ ; $-5$ and $-1$ satisfies $\lfloor 5\sin x \rfloor+ \lfloor\cos x\rfloor+6=0$ But substituting these values in the second equation spent yield me the answer But seems like I'm totally wrong as the correct answer would be $$\left(\frac{3×\sqrt3+4}{5},-1\right)$$ I think Im missing something conceptual here.

4674599,Do general Riemannian manifolds satisfy the SAS (side-angle-side) postulate?,"By triangle I have in mind something where all sides must be length minimizing geodesics, i.e. geodesic segments. In particular the distances between their endpoints will be the length of the geodesic. Cf. this question . Question: Assume $M$ is a connected and geodesically complete smooth Riemannian manifold. Then given points $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , $A'$ , $B'$ , $C'$ , and $d(A,B) = d(A',B')$ , $d(B,C)=d(B',C')$ , and $\angle (A,B,C) = \angle(A',B',C')$ , can we conclude that $d(A,C)=d(A',C')$ , $\angle(B,C,A)=\angle(B',C',A')$ , and $\angle(C,A,B)=\angle(C',A',B')$ ? Question 2: Same as the above but assume $M$ is additionally simply connected. (E.g. no tori.) Because this is probably a basic and well-known result, a pointer to a reference would suffice. Background/motivation/what I've considered so far: The SAS postulate is true in absolute geometry (i.e. Euclidean or hyperbolic), cf. this question . And apparently it is also true in spherical geometry using the correct notion of ""triangle"" or ""side"", i.e. length-minimizing geodesics, cf. this question . So that covers all of the ( $2$ -dimensional, but the proofs probably don't depend on the dimension) Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature. But those are a very special class, so it's not clear to me that it would generalize. There would seem to potentially be topological obstructions in general, i.e. due to the Riemannian manifold being mildly ""pathological"", hence my restriction to connected and geodesically complete (= complete metric space by Hopf-Rinow theorem ) smooth Riemannian manifolds. (To be honest those are the only Riemannian manifolds I am interested in anyway.) But even for ""non-pathological"" Riemannian manifolds, it still seems like the most possible obstruction to generalizing a result that holds for those with constant curvature is topological. E.g. with a torus, if the hypothetical missing thirds segment ""passes through the donut hole"" for $A$ and $C$ , but not for $A'$ and $C'$ , then I could imagine this failing. But would that actually be a valid counterexample? And if so, is lack of simple connectedness the only possible obstruction? A ""global"" topological obstruction (such as lack of simple connectedness) being the only possible obstruction seems conceivable to the extent that Riemannian manifolds are ""locally"" or ""infinitesimally"" Euclidean. But of course all of this is mostly hand-waving and speculation on my part.

For background, the above question arises in considering the following puzzle: Alice and Bob are in prison, and the warden suggests a deal to them, where they will go free if they can win the following game: 0. First Alice and Bob are allowed to devise a strategy on their own, after being told about this game. However, after they agree to start the game, Alice and Bob may have no further contact. 1. The warden shows Alice an oriented $m\times m$ grid of coins, each of which will be randomly in either the heads or tails position. 2. Next, the warden points to a (randomly chosen) particular coin position, say position $P$ , which is seen by Alice. (He doesn't change the coins in any way.) 3. Alice is then required to flip exactly one coin, of her choosing. (She may not avoid flipping any coins.) 4. Alice leaves and Bob is shown the grid of coins. The two have had no contact since Alice saw the coins and Bob has not seen the coins before this. 5. Bob must determine the position $P$ , with no further input aside from looking at the coins. If this is accomplished, then Alice and Bob go free. The question is, for which $m$ is a winning strategy possible, and what would be such a strategy?

It is to be noted, $n\geq k\geq 0,$ with $n+k=m.$ This, means, $n=m-k$ and $$n\geq k\implies m\geq 2k\implies k\leq \frac m2.$$ We observe, if $$k=0,1,2,\cdots, \lfloor \frac m2\rfloor$$ , $$n=m,m-1,m-2,\cdots,m-\lfloor \frac m2\rfloor$$ , respectively. $$\sum\binom nk=\binom{m}{0}+\binom{m-1}{1}+\binom{m-2}{2}+\cdots +\binom{m-\lfloor \frac m2\rfloor}{\lfloor \frac m2\rfloor}=F_{m+1}.$$ Now, we try to represent $\sum\binom nk=F_{m},$ , such that $n\geq k\geq 0,$ with $n+k=m-1,$ in the same form as above.

The reason why I am asking is that I was reading the proof that Haar basis for $L^{2}[0,1]$ is complete . So we already have that if the integral of a continuous function is $0$ on all dyadic intervals then the function itself is $0$ . I was thinking whether we can use this to conclude for all $L^{2}$ functions by using the density of $C[0,1]$ . So to do this, I would need that $C[0,1]\subseteq\overline{span\{e_{n}\}}$ What I have tried is just naively defined $w_{n}=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\langle w,e_{n}\rangle e_{n}$ which will converge due to Bessel's inequality . Now all we have to do is show that $w_{n}\to w$ .
We directly have Cauchyness of $w_{n}$ so it does have a limit to some $w'\in\overline{W}$ . But to show that $w'=w$ , I'll end up using that $\overline{W}$ also has the property that $\langle w',e_{n}\rangle =0$ for all $n$ implies $w'=0$ .

4674745,"Instantiating single-variable ""ordinary"" derivatives from total derivatives","We've been learning total derivatives in class and I had some questions about how our ""ordinary"" single-variable derivatives are instantiated from all this. Let's say we have a differentiable real-to-real function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ . Just to see how everything relates, I will try to compute every ""derivative-related object"" that we've learned (e.g. total, ordinary, directional etc.) By definition, the total derivative $Df(x)$ is the linear function $T : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the following limit: $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|f(x+h)-f(x)-A(h)|}{|h|} = \lim_{h \to 0} |\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} - \frac{A(h)}{h}| = |\lim_{h \to 0}[\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}-\frac{A(h)}{h}]|$ $= |f'(x) - lim_{h \to 0}\frac{A(h)}{h}|$ (I believe it can be shown that for all x, $Df(x)$ exists iff $f'(x)$ exists?) This makes it clear that, if $Df(x)$ exists, then it must be $(Df(x))(v) = f'(x)v$ The directional derivative $D_{v}f(x)$ is simply the total derivative evaluated at v i.e. $D_{v}f(x)=(Df(x))(v)=f'(x)v$ Thus we get that: $$(1) f'(x) = Df(x)(1) = D_{1}f(x)$$ or equivalently $$ (2) f'(x) = Df(x)(e_{1}) = D_{e_{1}}f(x)$$ where $D_{e_{1}}f(x)$ is the partial derivative of f wrt x (the only possible direction). My questions are: Is it only accidental that (1) and (2) holds or is there some special reason behind it? Given that (1) and (2), is it fair to say that partial derivatives (each of which is the total derivative evaluated on vectors of the standard basis) is a true generalization of a ""ordinary derivative"" like $f'(x)$ in higher dimensions?","['multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives', 'analysis']"

4674821,Comparing two hypothetical investment opportunities.,"I came across a problem comparing two hypothetical investment opportunities. in both cases, you will invest some money and get a daily return on it. However, the return will follow one of these roles: You will get $\$35$ each day. You will have a $36\%$ probability of getting $\$70$ each day, however, if you did not receive it, the probability the next day will increase by $20\%$ . and if you receive it, the probability will reset back to $36\%$ .
(for example, if you did not receive money on day $1$ , you will have a probability of $56\%$ of getting the $\$70$ . And if you did not get any money on days $1$ and $2$ , the probability of getting $\$70$ on the third day is $76\%$ . and so on) I tried to formulate it mathematically and found that the second option is better, On the other hand, I model the problem in Excel and found that both of them are equal. my mathematical solution was based on: First: find the success probability of some sequenced days, and then average the $\$70$ on these days. \begin{align*}
\Bbb{P}(\text{return at day 1}) &= 36\%\\
\Bbb{P}(\text{return at day 2}) &= \Bbb{P}(\text{no return at day 1})\cdot (36\% + 20\%) = 35.84\%\\
\Bbb{P}(\text{return at day 3}) &= \Bbb{P}(\text{no return at day 1})\cdot\Bbb{P}(\text{no return at day 2}) \cdot (36\% +2 \cdot 20\%)= 21.4016\%\\
\Bbb{P}(\text{return at day 4}) &= 6.488\%\\
\Bbb{P}(\text{return at day 5}) &= 0.27\%
\end{align*} Second, find the equivalent daily return after getting the \$70, which is: $\$70$ if you get the return on the first day. $\$35(70/2)$ if you get the return on the second day. $\$23.33(70/3)$ if you get the return on the third day. $\$17.5 then \$14$ for the fourth and fifth days. finally, the total equivalent daily return of the second option is: $$Eq_r = \sum_{i=1}^5  P(\text{return at day i}) \cdot \frac{70}{i} =43.91 $$ What option will result in more return over time? Notes: The probabilities in the second option will increase by $20$ until it reaches $100\%$ , so they are $\{36,56,76,96,100\}$ .

I solved it, correctly, as follows: The case when D appears first in the list: $ \underline{1} \; \underline{5} \; \underline{4} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} = 120 $ The case when D appears second in the list: $\underline{4} \; \underline{1} \; \underline{4} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} = 96$ The case when D appears third in the list: $ \underline{4} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{1} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} = 72 $ The case when D appears fourth in the list: $\underline{4} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} = 48 $ The case when D appears fifth in the list: $  \underline{4} \; \underline{3} \; \underline{2} \; \underline{1} \; \underline{1} \; \underline{1} = 24 $ The sum is the answer: $ 120 + 96 + 72 + 48 + 24 = 360 $ However, the correct answer (that relates to combinations) is as follows: Begin with six blank spaces and select two of these spaces. Put the D in the first selected space and the A in the second. There are $ C(6, 2) = 15 $ ways of doing this. For each of these 15 choices there are 4! = 24 ways of filling in the remaining spaces. Thus the answer to the question is 15×24 = 360 such lists. I do not understand why $ C(6,2) = 15 $ accounts for the possible combinations of $ A $ and $ D $ , although I do understand the arithmetic behind it: $ \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 $ . I thought $C(6,2)$ represented the possible non-repeated subsets of length $ k $ from a set with $ n $ elements. Therefore, would not C(6,2) include all elements of the set $ \{A, B, C, D, E, F, G\} $ ? Could someone explain this solution?",['combinatorics']
4674841,Generalization of $y-x$ vector space,"I was wondering about, if we have two vectors $x=\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $y=\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \in \Bbb R^2$ , then $y-x=\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ . If we think about the subspace spanned by this $y-x$ vector, then we know it could be represented by the line along the $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ diagonal.

Now i guess that i need to show that exists some function $g: (T^{*}E^{*},\omega_1)\to (T^{*}E,\omega_2)$ such that $g^{*}\omega_2=\omega_1$ , so how can to start or how i need to define $g$ ? $E^{*}$ and $T^{*}E^{*}$ are simplectic manifolds and i guess that $T^{*}:E^{*}\to E$ such that $T^{*}E^{*}=\{(h,e)\in E^{*}\times E : g(h)=\pi(e)\}$ am I right?

Note: I am not sure about my definitions about $T^{*}E^{*}$ just it was intuition but i will appreciate if somebody can help me understand this point too.

Even this i am stuck i do not how to proceed. As a @Chris H said before, when the bundle is trivial we have the following: $T^{*}E$ is isomorphism with $$T^{*}M \times \mathbb{R^{n}}\times \mathbb {R^{n^{*}}}$$ and $T^{*}E^{*}$ is isomorphism with $$T^{*}M \times \mathbb{R^{n^{*}}}\times \mathbb{R^{n}}$$ then the canonical forms in $T^{*}E$ and $T^{*}E^{*}$ can be describe by $$\sum^{n}dx_i\wedge dy_i +dr_i\wedge ds_i$$ and $$\sum^{n}dx_i\wedge dy_i +ds_i\wedge dr_i$$ . Therefore, we can define a difeomorphism by $$\phi:T^{*}E\to T^{*}E^{*} $$ by $\phi(x,y,s,r)=(x,y,r,s)$ and this satisfies that $\phi^{*}\omega_1=\omega_0$ . How can continued by the general case?

Prove that there exists a constant $\kappa > 0$ such that $$\|(I_N+A)^{-1}\|_1 \leq \kappa $$ as $N \to \infty.$ Else show a counterexample. I attempted to demonstrate that the boundedness of $\|(I_N+A)^{-1}\|_1$ can be proven using the definition of $\| \cdot \|_1$ as follows $$ \|(I_N + A)^{-1} \|_1 = \sup_{x \neq 0} \frac{ \|(I_N + A)^{-1} x\|_1 }{\|x\|_1} = \sup_{z \neq 0} \frac{ \|z\|_1 }{\|(I_N+A)z\|_1} \leq \sup_{z \neq 0} \frac{ \|z\|_1 }{|\|Az\|_1 - \|z\|_1|} = \sup_{z \neq 0} \frac{1}{ \Big| \frac{\|Az\|_1}{\|z\|_1} - 1 \Big| } $$ However, it seems possible that $\inf_{z} \Big|\frac{\|Az\|_1}{\|z\|_1} - 1 \Big|=0$ , so I doubt this proof is wrong.

But the idea is similar. Let's look at the steps involved for the $(1+1)$ dimensional case $(\zeta^{1,1},u)$ where $u=\frac{dxdq}{xq}.$ The Cauchy foliation is simply $\ln(b)\ln(y)=t$ (solving for $y$ gives an explicit representation) which can then be transformed via Mellin-like transform: $$\Phi_s(t)= \int_{S=(0,1)} \exp {\frac{t s}{\ln b}}~db = \int_0^1 tb^{t-1} \exp \frac{s}{\ln b}~db = 2\sqrt{ts}K_1(2\sqrt{ts})$$ Observe that this is an unnormalized K-distribution and it's inverse transform yields an unnormalized distribution call it the ""Zeta-distribution"" (our Cauchy foliation). Observe that the Fisher information metric of the Zeta-distribution is $\Phi_s(t)$ up to a factor. Observe that the Zeta-distribution yields solutions to the Killing field $X=\langle x \ln x, -y\ln y \rangle.$ It also provides a distributional solution to the backwards heat equation with diffusivity depending on both space and time: $$\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\Phi(t,b)=-\frac{b}{t}\frac{\partial}{\partial b}\Phi(t,b)$$ In short, $\Phi_1(t)=v$ is a Lorentzian metric on the smooth $(1+0)$ manifold $(\Psi^{~1,0}, v).$ We have that $\Psi^{~3,1}=\Psi^{~1,1}\times \Psi^{~1,0} \times \Psi^{~1,0}$ so we can define the product metric on $\Psi^{~3,1}.$ What is the exact form of the metric (line element) for $(\Psi^{~3,1},v)?$ I believe it is of the form $v=v_1 \oplus v_2 \oplus v_3$ and should be expressed in terms of $K_1$ (Bessel functions).

If n denotes the minimum no. of roots of the equation $$ [f''(x)]^2+f'(x)f'''(x) =0$$ in [0,6]. Then the minimum value of n is? The answer is 12 and the approach used requires us to find the $x \in [0,6]$ where $f'(x) = 0$ , the solution only used the equation $f(x) = f(6-x)$ Differentiating both sides $f'(x) = -f'(6-x)$ Using this equation and the fact that $f'(0)=f'(2)=f'(5) = 0$ , it deduces that $f'(x) = 0$ at $x =0,1,2,3,4,5,6$ .

Then instead of having only a unique local function $y(x):(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)\longrightarrow V'$ such that $F(x,y(x))=0$ for some $V'\subset\mathbb{R}$ , we should be able to assert the existence of a unique global function $y^*(x):U\longrightarrow V''$ such that $F(x,y^*(x))=0$ . The way I was thinking of this was the following: say we have $y=y_0$ , $\varepsilon=\varepsilon_0$ on $(-\varepsilon_0,\varepsilon_0)$ . Then we can consider $F(\varepsilon_0,y_0(\varepsilon_0))=0$ , $F_y(\varepsilon_0,y_0(\varepsilon_0))\neq 0$ and find another uniques $y_1:(\varepsilon_0-\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_0+\varepsilon_1)\longrightarrow V'''$ and on the overlap by uniqueness $y_0\equiv y_1$ . So defining $y^*$ by cases as $y_0$ on $(\varepsilon_0,\varepsilon_0)$ and $y_1$ on $[\varepsilon_0,\varepsilon_1)$ we have, repeating this inductively, a $y_*$ globally defined not only on $(-\varepsilon_0,\varepsilon_1)$ , but on $U$ . However this can be only if the sequence $\varepsilon_i$ does not decrease too fast and the boundary values $y_i(\varepsilon_i)$ satisfy $F_y(\varepsilon_i,y_i(\varepsilon_i))\neq 0$ and $F(\varepsilon_i,y_i(\varepsilon_i))=0$ at each step. The second of these issues is taken care of by the hypothesis that $F(x,y)=0$ for every $x\in U$ , since this ensures that if $F(\varepsilon_i,y_i(\varepsilon_i))\neq0$ for some $i$ , we have covered the whole of $U$ (I am thinking only about its right half, the reasoning extends symmetrically). My question is: what are usual hypotheses which on the other hand ensure that the $\varepsilon_i$ do not decrease too fast? Are the ones given above already enough? Is it possible to devise one that ensures this? I think perhaps by contradiction one can show that the $\varepsilon_i$ can only stop at the boundary of $U$ , since if, say, they converge at some $-u<b<u$ , where $U=(-u,u)$ for example. Then one can take $b$ and apply the IFT there, extending the unique solution a little further, against the hypothesis that it could not be done. Is this the right idea?

A circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ touches $AB$ at $D$ , $BC$ at $E$ , $AC$ at $F$ . $G$ is on $DE$ such that $FG\perp DE$ . Prove $FG$ bisects $\angle{AGC}$ . I managed to prove this using cartesian coordinates, but my proof takes about two pages of equations. I'm looking for a more elegant proof. (Here is an outline of my proof. Let the circle have cartesian equation $x^2+y^2=1$ and assign coordinates: $D\space (-p,-\sqrt{1-p^2})$ , $E\space (p,-\sqrt{1-p^2})$ , $F\space (-q,\sqrt{1-q^2})$ . In terms of $p$ and $q$ , find the equations of the lines that make the three sides of the triangle, then find the coordinates of $A$ , $C$ and $G$ .

A problem solving approach was presented in the book, which goes as follows: Solve $(D^3+3D^2+2D)y = x^2$ The solution given was : The roots of $f(D)$ are $0,-2, -1$ ; and hence the complementary function is $c_1 + c_2e^{-2x}+ c_3e^{-x}.$ The particular integral $$\frac{1}{D^3+3D^2+2D}x^2=\frac{1}{2D}(1+\frac 32D+\frac {D^2} {2})^{-1}(x^2)=\frac{1}{2D}(1+\frac 32D+\frac {7D^2} {4}+...)(x^2)=\frac{1}{2D}(x^2-3x+\frac 72)=\frac{x}{12}(2x^2-9x+21),$$ and $\frac 1D x$ being merely $\int xdx.$ The complete solution is $$y=c_1 + c_2e^{-2x}+ c_3e^{-x}+\frac{x}{12}(2x^2-9x+21).$$ Then, they asked to: Solve $$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-y=2+5x$$ by this method ( method described above). I tried solving it,like this: Given, $$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-y=2+5x.$$ This implies $(D^2-1)y=2+5x.$ Now, we wish to calculate solution of the equation $(D^2-1)y=0,$ i.e the complementary function. The roots of the function $f(x)=x^2-1=0,$ is $x=\pm 1.$ So, the complementary function is $c_1e^{1}+c_2e^{-1}.$ Now, we proceed to calculate the particular integral of $$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-y=2+5x.$$ This is given by $y=\frac{1}{D^2-1}(2+5x).$ We can write this as $$y=\frac{1}{D^2-1}(2+5x)\implies \frac{1}{D}(D-\frac 1D)^{-1}(2+5x)=\frac 1D(1+D-\frac 1D-1)^{-1}(2+5x)=\frac 1D[1-(D-\frac 1D-1)+(D-\frac 1D-1)^2](2+5x)=\frac 1D(1-D+\frac 1D+1+D^2+\frac{1}{D^2}+1-2-2D+2\frac 1D)(2+5x)=\frac 1D[(2+5x)-D(2+5x)+\frac 1D(...$$ But the problem lies here.

4675140,The proof of additivity of total variation of complex measure by Axler.,"I'm reading the proof of ""total variation function is positive measure"" on p.261 in Measure, Integration and Real Analysis by Axler.
(The book pdf: https://measure.axler.net/MIRA.pdf ) Let $\nu$ be a complex measure on measurable space $(X,\mathscr S)$ , and $|\nu|:\mathscr S\to[0,\infty]$ be the total variation of $\nu$ , i.e., $$|\nu|(E)
=\{|\nu(E_1)|+\cdots+|\nu(E_n)| \ ;\ n\in\mathbb N, E_1,\cdots,E_n \in\mathscr S \ \mathrm{are \ disjoint,\ }\ E_1\cup\cdots\cup E_n\subset E \}.$$ Then, $|\nu|$ is a positive measure on $(X,\mathscr S)$ . What I have to see is: (i) $|\nu|(\emptyset)=0$ (ii) $|\nu|(\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty|\nu|(A_k)$ for disjoint $\{A_k\}_k\subset\mathscr S.$ I understand (i), and for (ii), I understand $|\nu|(\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k)\leqq\sum_{k=1}^\infty|\nu|(A_k)$ but I don't see the proof of the other direction. The written proof is as follows. Fix $m\in\mathbb N.$ For each $k\in\{1,\cdots,m\}$ , suppose $n_k\in\mathbb N$ and $E_{1,k}\ ,\dots,E_{n_k\ ,k}\in\mathscr S$ are disjoint s.t. $$E_{1,k}\cup\cdots\cup E_{n_k\ ,k}\subset A_k.$$ Then, $\{E_{j,k}\ ; 1\leq k\leq m, 1\leq j\leq n_k\}$ is a disjoint collection of sets in $\mathscr S$ that are contained in $\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k.$ Thus $$\sum_{k=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^{n_k}|\nu(E_{j,k})|\leqq |\nu|(\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k).$$ Taking the spremum of the left side over all choices of $\{E_{j,k}\}$ , we get $$\sum_{k=1}^m|\nu|(A_k)\leqq |\nu|(\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k).$$ Letting $m\to\infty$ , I get the result. I don't understand the part Taking the spremum of the left side over all choices of $\{E_{j,k}\}$ , we get $$\sum_{k=1}^m|\nu|(A_k)\leqq |\nu|(\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k).$$ Now, for each $k,$ we have, by the definition, $$|\nu|(A_k)=\{|\nu(E_{1,k})|+\cdots+|\nu(E_{n_k\ ,k})| \ ;\ n_k\in\mathbb N, E_{1,k}\ \dots,E_{n_k\ ,k} \in\mathscr S \ \mathrm{are \ disjoint\ }\ E_{1,k}\cup\cdots\cup E_{n_k\ ,k}\subset A_k \}.$$ At the first part, we picked arbitrarily $n_k\in\mathbb N$ and $E_{1,k},\dots,E_{n_k,k}\in\mathscr S$ so that they are disjoint and satisfy $$E_{1,k}\cup\dots\cup E_{n_k,k}\subset A_k,$$ so I think it is appropriate to take the supremum over all choices of $E_{1,k}\ ,\cdots,E_{n_k,k}$ , instead of $\{E_{j,k}\}$ . If we take the supremum over the choices of $\{E_{j,k}\}$ , we have to pick $\{E_{j,k}\}$ arbitrarily at first. What's going on here? How did he take the supremum and get $\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^m|\nu|(A_k)\leqq |\nu|(\cup_{k=1}^\infty A_k)$ ? Maybe I'm missing something easy, but I don't notice.

As a consequence, $f$ is not of bounded variation on any finite interval, ( $f$ is said to be of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ if for any partition $a=x_0<x_1<x_2<\cdots<x_{n-1}<x_n=b$ , $\sum_{k=1}^n|f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1})|\leq M$ for a constant $M$ independent of the choice of partition) since functions of bounded variation are differentiable a.e. (as a corollary of this and the Lebesgue theorem ). In particular, the proof that $f$ is not of bounded variation is not shown explicitly via the definition of functions of bounded variation. Question: Can we construct a sequence of partitions on any interval $[a,b]$ for which the sequence of sums $\sum_{k=1}^n|f(x_k)-f(x_{k-1})|$ increases to positive infinite, showing that $f$ is not of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ ?","['bounded-variation', 'real-analysis']"

My current understanding is that (1) is necessary to give a sign to the integral, just as we have in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . (3) is necessary to eliminate cases where the domain is infinite (for example, to rule out $\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx$ ). However, I am less certain about why (2) is necessary. In Lee's An Introduction to Smooth Manifolds , he gives some intuition about how top forms provide a way of measuring ""signed volume"" at each point of a manifold.

I conjecture the answer is no , though I'm unsure of how to prove it. I can answer some variations of the question, though. It is natural to ask what happens if the $1$ in the above question is replaced with other numbers. If $1$ in the above question is replaced with $\ln2$ (meaning we want $f_i(0)$ and $f_i(\ln2)$ to be integers), then there is such a sequence, namely $(e^x,e^x,e^x,\ldots)$ . Similarly, if $1$ is replaced with $\pi$ , then $(\cos x,\sin x,-\cos x,-\sin x,\cos x,\dotsb)$ is such a sequence. A little thought will reveal a generalization. Consider again the above question with $1$ replaced with some other number $\alpha$ . If $e^\alpha\in\Bbb Q$ then there is such a sequence of functions, and if both $\sin\alpha,\cos\alpha\in\Bbb Q$ then there is such a sequence of functions (in each case take some constant multiple of the sequences mentioned above). It is interesting to note that the sets $\{x:\sin x,\cos x\in\Bbb Q\}$ and $\{x:e^x\in\Bbb Q\}$ are both closed under addition and subtraction.

Since $g(x):=tan(f(x))+e^{-|x|^2}$ I can rewrite to $arctan(g(x)-e^{-|x|^2})=f(x)$ . Because $arctan$ is bounded and equal to $f$ it follows that $f$ is bounded. Applying the liouville theorem shows that $f$ is constant.

4676100,Integral over circular disk region to Integral over rectangular region.,"I was going through the double integral over the general region in the plane and had a question. When we integrate over a circular disk : $$
D=\{(x, y) \mid \delta(x) \leq y \leq \gamma(x), a \leq x \leq b\}

Instead of this if I wanted to make my work easier and instead of dealing with a case where the elementary region is a circle or semi-circle, I want to make it a rectangle. Because I need the same volume, I would need the base area to be equal at every height, which essentially boils down to making the base area the same. As in both cases, the base area won't decrease as a function of height.(i) So, now let's make the area equal. $\operatorname{Radius}(r)=\frac{|b-a|}{2}$ Area of the circular disk $=$ Area of the rectangle. $$

4676104,Cotangent space and pushforward,"I wonder if there is a connection between the following two notions: Pushforward: For a smooth map $f:M\to N$ between smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$ , we define the pushforward $$df:TM\to TN$$ between the tangent spaces $TM$ and $TN$ . For a derivation $X\in T_xM$ , we define $df(X)=df\vert_x(X)$ to send a smooth map $g:N\to\mathbb R$ to $X(g\circ f)$ . Cotangent Space: On the other hand, we also define the cotangent space of $M$ at $x\in M$ to be $T^*_xM$ , the dual space of $T_xM$ . If we have a chart $\phi=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ around $x$ , we have a basis $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$ with $1\leq i\leq n$ . It induces a dual basis on $T^*_xM$ , given by the linear maps $dx_i\vert _x:T_xM\to\mathbb R$ , defined by $dx_i\vert_x\big(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\big)=\delta_{ij}$ (Kronecker delta). Why do we use the same notation for both? If I consider for instance the map $$x_i:\mathbb R^n\ni(x_1,\dots,x_n)\mapsto x_i\in\mathbb R,$$ it is unclear if by $dx_i\vert_x$ I mean the pushforward map or an element of the dual basis of $T_x^*\mathbb R^n$ . I figured both cannot be the same, though: If we consider $dx_i\vert_x$ as a pushforward, then $dx_i\vert_x(X)$ is a derivtion (hence a map). If we consider $dx_i\vert_x$ as a basis element of $T_x^*\mathbb R^n$ , then $dx_i\vert_x(X)$ is a real number. While writing this, I got the idea that the derivation $dx_i\vert_x(X)$ is just an element of a one-dimensional vector space with a canonical basis, so we can just identify it with the corresponding scalar.

4676587,Homotopy lifting as iterated path lifting,"Let $X$ be a topological space, with $\gamma : [0,1] \to X $ some path in $X$ . Suppose $p : \hat{X} \to X$ is a covering map. Then, by the path-lifting lemma, we know that for each $\hat{x} \in p^{-1} ( \gamma(0))$ , there exists a unique lift $\hat{\gamma} : [0,1] \to \hat{X}$ such that $\hat{\gamma}(0) = \hat{x}$ . Similarly, the homotopy lifting lemma asserts the existence of unique lifts for maps $I \times I \to X$ . It has previously been remarked that homotopies may be considered as paths in $C(X,Y)$ endowed with an appropriate topology (e.g. compact-open). Therefore, my question is: Question : can the homotopy lifting lemma be deduced from the path-lifting lemma applied twice? I offer an outline of a plausible proof, which I would struggle to verify as I am not well-acquainted with the compact-open topology (or any topology on $C(X,Y)$ ). Let $H : I \times I \to X$ be our candidate map for lifting. Define $\gamma_i : [0,1] \to X, x \mapsto H(x,i)$ (for $i = 0,1$ ). These give unique lifts $\hat{\gamma_i} : [0,1] \to \hat{X}$ . Consider $\gamma_i$ as elements of $C([0,1],X)$ . Note that there is a path $\eta$ between them in this space, described by $H$ . Prove that $C([0,1] ,\hat{X})$ is a covering space of $C([0,1],X)$ . By the path-lifting lemma, there exists a unique lift of $\eta : [0,1] \to C([0,1],X)$ to $\hat{\eta}:[0,1] \to C([0,1],\hat{X})$ . This implies a unique lift $\hat{H}:I \times I \to \hat{X}$ of $H$ , concluding the proof. The steps (1),(2) and (5) are consequences of the path-lifting lemma. (3) may be assumed given a suitable topology on $C(X,Y)$ . Thus, this question boils down to proving that [there exists a topology on $C(X,Y)$ such that] steps (4) and (6) are valid. Edit : a natural suggestion for the covering map in (4) is: $$P : \hat{\gamma} \mapsto p \circ \hat{\gamma}$$ I am likely to have made a typographical error somewhere.

4676700,Prove the difference of 2 solutions of different initial values problems is increasing with time,"I'm trying to solve this problem. In fact, I'm not really sure how to solve this, but, with guesses, I do have an attempt which is the following: Since for the second coordinate(that is $y$ coordinate), $f_{2}$ only depends on $y$ and they have the same initial values, the second coordinate of the solution curve to be the same, so I just consider the first coordinate Suppose the solution in the first coordinate is $x(t,x_{0})$ . Here I use $x_{0}$ to denote the initial value which is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $X$ to denote this coordinate (direction). Then I have the following calculation $$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}(t,x_{0})&= f_{1}(x,y) \\ \\ \frac{\partial^2 x }{\partial X\partial t}(t,x_{0}) &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y) \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial X}(t,x_{0}) 
\end{align}$$ Then consider the ode $$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left( \frac{\partial x}{\partial X}(t,x_{0}) \right)=  \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x}(x,y) \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial X}(t,x_{0}) 
\end{align}$$ This is a first order linear ode with respect to $\frac{\partial x}{\partial X}$ . By solving it, I can obtain $$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial X}(t,x_{0})=C\exp\left( \int _{0}^t  \frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x} \ d s \right)
\end{align}$$ So far, I think that if all things above are right, then as long as $C>0$ , with $g(t)=\int_{0}^t\frac{\partial f_{1}}{\partial x} \ d s>0$ , then I can say that $\frac{\partial x}{\partial X}$ is increasing as $t$ is increasing, and hence if I have 2 different solutions $$\begin{align}
x(t,x_{1})< \tilde{x}(t,x_{2})
\end{align}$$ at $t=0$ . That is, $x_{1}<x_{2}$ , we can have, when $t>s$ $$\begin{align}
\frac{\tilde{x}(t,x_{2})-x(t,x_{1})}{x_{2}-x_{1}}&> \frac{\tilde{x}(s,x_{2})-x(s,x_{1})}{x_{2}-x_{1}} \\  \tilde{x}(t,x_{2})-x(t,x_{1})&> \tilde{x}(s,x_{2})-x(s,x_{1})
\end{align}$$ which is done. Now I have 2 questions: 1 I strongly doubt my attempt. If the above is wrong can anyone show me how to approach this problem? 2 If the reasoning above is right, how should I compute the constant $C$ ?

\|T\|_{1\to 1}=\sup_{\substack{A\in\mathbb C^{n\times n}\\A\text{ Hermitian, }\|A\|_1\leq 1}}\|T(A)\|_1\,?
$$ Two observations: 1. $\geq$ is obvious so we would only have to show $\leq$ .
2. Because the trace norm is convex and the trace norm unit ball is the convex hull of rank-1 matrices $uv^*$ (with $\|u\|=\|v\|=1$ ) this can be re-formulated as follows: If $T$ preserves Hermiticity , is it true that the operator norm of $T$ is attained on a rank-1 state, that is, $$
\sup_{v,w\in\mathbb C^n,\|v\|=\|w\|=1}\|T(vw^*)\|_1\leq\sup_{v\in\mathbb C^n,\|v\|=1}\|T(vv^*)\|_1\,?
$$ This is true if $T$ is positive (i.e. maps positive semi-definite elements to positive semi-definite elements) as a consequence of the Russo-Dye theorem, cf. Theorem 3.39 in ""The Theory of Quantum Information"" by Watrous, 2018. However, the proof given therein breaks down if $T$ is not positive but only Hermiticity-preserving as it relies on the fact that $\|\sum_j u_jP_j\|\leq\|u\|_\infty\|\sum_j P_j\|$ for all $P_j\geq 0$ (Lemma 3.3 in his book). Interestingly, this property holds for the ""stronger"" completely bounded trace norm --- sometimes called diamond norm --- which is defined as $$
\|T\|_\diamond:=\max_{k\in\mathbb N}\|T\otimes{\rm id}_{\mathbb C^{k\times k}}\|_{1\to 1}\,.
$$ The idea here (cf. Lemma 3.50 ff.) is that if $X$ attains the operator norm of $T$ , then the norm of $T\otimes{\rm id}$ on $$
\frac12\begin{pmatrix}0&X\\X^*&0\end{pmatrix}
$$ is $\|T\|_{1\to 1}$ because $T(X^*)=T(X)^*$ . Using the spectral decomposition of this block matrix together with convexity of the norm yields ""the"" desired rank-1 state $uu^*$ . So in some sense having access to ""more dimensions"" allows for a symmetrization of the problem.
However, numerics suggest that this is not necessary:
using that every Hermiticity-preserving map is the difference of two completely positive maps (cf. Theorem 2.25) I wrote some rough Mathematica code generating random cp maps and finding $\sup_{u,v}\|T(uv^*)\|_1$ and $\sup_u\|T(uu^*)\|_1$ via random search: (*Initialization*)d = 4;

Problems which prevent a straightforward proof are that the usual convexity arguments do not work because the convex hull operator of Hermitian and skew-Hermitian matrices from the unit ball are a strict subset of the unit ball (consider $e_1e_2^*$ ) $T$ preserving Hermiticity does not hand down any nice properties to $T^*(V)$ for $V$ unitary; at least I don't see why it should.

Consider next the group $G:=\langle p\rangle\leq (\mathbb Z/m\mathbb Z)^\times$ . The quotient group $(\mathbb Z/m\mathbb Z)^\times/G$ will contain $n$ elements, say $a_1G,\dots,a_nG$ .

As well known, the complex projective plane $\mathbb{C}P^2$ can be obtained from the sphere $\mathbb S^2$ by attaching a 4-dimensional cell along the Hopf map $\rho: \mathbb S^3\to \mathbb S^2.$ In other words, we have the following CW complex structure for $\mathbb{C}P^2$ : $$ \mathbb{C}P^2 = (\mathbb S^2\sqcup \mathbb D^4)/\sim\ = \mathbb S^2\cup_{\rho} \mathbb D^4$$ where the identification is given by $x\sim \rho (x)$ for $x\in \mathbb S^3$ . Taking the suspension of $\mathbb{C}P^2$ , we have $$\Sigma\mathbb{C}P^2 = (\mathbb S^3\sqcup S^1\sqcup \mathbb D^5)/\sim\ = \mathbb S^3\cup_{\rho} (\mathbb S^1\sqcup \mathbb D^5)$$ where the identification is given by identifying the basepoints of $\mathbb S^3$ and $\mathbb S^1$ and collapsing the $\mathbb S^1$ factor to a point. We can further simplify this space by noting that $\mathbb S^1\sqcup \mathbb D^5$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb S^5$ via the map $(\theta,x)\mapsto(\cos\theta x,\sin\theta x)$ for $\theta\in[0,\pi]$ and $x\in \mathbb D^5$ , which identifies the equator of $\mathbb S^5$ with $\mathbb S^1\subseteq \mathbb S^5$ . Under this homeomorphism, the Hopf map $\rho$ becomes a map $g: \mathbb S^3\to \mathbb S^5$ that sends the equator of $\mathbb S^3$ to the equator of $\mathbb S^5$ and the north and south poles of $\mathbb S^3$ to the two points where the equator of $\mathbb S^5$ intersects the $\mathbb S^3$ factor of $\Sigma\mathbb{C}P^2$ . Thus, we must have $\Sigma\mathbb{C}P^2\cong \mathbb S^3\cup_g \mathbb S^5\cong \mathbb S^3\vee \mathbb S^5.$ Give me your comments on this proof. Does it have any errors?

4677044,Invariant subspaces in the context of representation theory,"In what follows, let $G$ be a finite group, $F$ a field and $V$ a vector space over $F$ . First we fix some definitions: Representation: A homomorphism $\phi:G\to GL(V)$ . In this sense, if $V$ is a finite- $n$ -dimensional vector space over $F$ , we can conflate $\rho$ with the image of $\rho(G)$ a finite collection of $n\times n$ matrices over $F$ corresponding to the action of $g$ on $v\in V$ . Sometimes, we will conflate $\rho(G)$ with $V$ itself. Subrepresentation: If $W$ is a subspace of $V$ then we say $W$ is a subrepresentation of $V$ if it is $G$ -invariant. i.e. the action of $g\in G$ on vectors in $W$ map to other vectors in $W$ . It is clear to me from this that $V,\{0\}$ are $G$ -invariant. Now, my confusion with these concepts arises when trying to justify why we can conflate $V$ with $\rho(G)$ . This becomes particularly apparent when I try to prove Schur's lemma. First, I assume the following form of Maschke's Theorem: If $V$ is a representation of some finite group (by which we mean that there is a $rho:G\to GL(V)$ ), and there exists $U$ a subrepresentation of $V$ (taken to mean that there is a $G$ -invariant subspace $U$ of $V$ ), then there is another subrepresentation $W$ of $V$ so $V=U\oplus W$ . i.e. $V$ is the direct sum of $U, W$ . The version of Schur's lemma I am trying to understand in light of the above is as follows: If $M,N$ are irreducible representations of $G$ and $\phi$ is a $G$ -linear transformation in the sense that $\phi$ commutes with the action of $g\in G$ on vectors $V$ in the representation $M$ , then $\phi$ is either the zero map or an isomorphism. Furthermore, $\phi$ must take the form $\lambda I_V$ for $\lambda\in F$ . Here is proof attempt/understanding of the proof: We will show that $\ker{\phi},\text{Im}{\phi}$ are $G$ -invariant since they are subspaces of $V, W$ respectively, where $V,W$ are the vector spaces we conflate with the representations $M,N$ . Let $v\in\ker{\phi}$ . Then $\phi(v)=0$ . So $\phi(gv)=\rho(g)\phi(v)=\rho(0)=0$ , as required. Similarly for the image, let $y\in\text{Im}{\phi}$ then there is $x\in V$ so $\phi(x)=y$ . So $\phi(gx)=g\phi(x)=\rho(g)y$ . I think in this context $\rho$ is associated with $N$ since otherwise $\rho(g)y$ makes no sense. Please correct me if I am wrong. But anyway, this immediately implies that the kernel and image are subrepresentations. By the irreducibility of $M,N$ we conclude that $\phi$ is an isomorphism. A question which occurs to me immediately at this point in the proof is the necessity of all of this. i.e. could we not also prove this statement by the following reasoning: if $\phi$ is linear from $V\to W$ , then $V,W$ have the same dimension, otherwise the kernel fails to be non-trivial? Why the need to show $G$ -invariance? Does this statement alone not already give us the fact that $\phi$ is bijective and hence an isomorphism since certainly it is a homomorphism by its linearity which is assumed? As for the second bit of the proof, the logic seems to go completely over my head. We would like that show that $\phi$ takes the form $\lambda I_V$ . Now, in particular, I guess that $\phi$ is really a homomorphism of linear transformations since $M,N$ are representations which are simply a collection of transformations on some ambient vector spaces $V,W$ . i.e. It seems to me that $\phi$ maps elements of $L(V,V)$ onto elements of $L(W,W)$ . Am I mistaken in thinking this? Now since we just established that $V$ and $W$ have the same cardinality, $L(V,V)$ should be isomorphic to $L(W,W)$ ? I guess in some sense since $\phi$ is a map from $L(V,V)\to L(W,W)$ , we can identify it with a map from $V\to W$ ? Is this line of reasoning correct? If so, then I guess if $\phi$ was not of the form $\lambda I_v$ for some lambda, then it would have a non-trivial proper eigenspace in which case $W$ wouldn't be irreducible? Is this moving in the right direction? I guess my largest concern lies in understanding the justification behind why we can conflate all of these objects. Apologies for the long-winded question. Any help clearing all this up for me is immensely appreciated as I've been muddling around with it for a good while now. Thanks in advance! Edit: As a comment kindly pointed out, I should specify $F$ is an algebraically closed field. I figured out my point of confusion thanks to the poster below. As for the second part of Schur's Lemma, a proof is as follows. If $\phi$ is a $G$ -linear map over a complete field, it has eigenvalues in this field. Say one of them is $\lambda$ . Then consider the transformation $\phi-\lambda I$ . If this does not have the trivial kernel, then since $V$ is irreducible the kernel must be all of $V$ . i.e. $\phi-\lambda I=0$ . The result follows.","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'representation-theory', 'vector-spaces', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra']"
4677061,Matrix multiplication seen as derivative or integral,"I'm reading the book ""Introduction to Linear Algebra 5th edition"" page 24 about Inverse Matrix, below is the background info. $$ \mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad
\mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix}.
$$ In which the author mentioned
""The differences $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ become the derivative $\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = b(t)$ . In the inverse direction, the sums $\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b}$ become the integral of $b(t)$ ."" I'm so confused about these statements, I'm thinking he meant vector $\mathbf{x}$ as a function, which applied to matrix $\mathbf{A}$ , so $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ .  Then how could: "" $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ become the derivative $\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = b(t)$ ""? As I cant imagine the derivative of $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ or $x(t)$ here. $$ \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 - x_1 \\ x_3 - x_2 \end{bmatrix} $$","['integration', 'derivatives', 'calculus', 'linear-algebra']"
4677096,Show that the product of the sigma-fields $F_j$ is the minimal $\sigma-$field over measurable rectangles,"I'm reading and solving ""probability and measure theory"" by Robert B. Ash and I'm stuck with the following exercise: Show that $\Pi_{j=1}^\infty\mathscr{F}_j$ is the minimal $\sigma-$ field over the measurable rectangles. the definitions are as follows: For each $j=1,2,...$ let $(\Omega_j,\mathscr{F}_j)$ be a measurable space. If $\Omega=\Pi_{j=1}^\infty\Omega_j$ and $B^n\subset\Pi_{j=1}^n \mathscr{\Omega_j}$ we define $B_n=\{\omega\in\Omega: (\omega_1,\dots,\omega_n)\in B^n\}$ . The set $B_n$ is called the cylinder with base $B^n$ ; the cylinder is said to be measurable if $B^n\in\Pi_{j=1}^n\mathscr{F}_j$ . If $B^n=A_1\times\dots\times A_n$ where for each $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$ , $A_i\in\mathscr{F}_j$ then $B_n$ is called a measurable rectangle. The minimal $\sigma-$ field over the measurable cylinders is called the product of the $\sigma-$ fields $\mathscr{F}_j$ , written $\Pi_{j=1}^\infty\mathscr{F}_j$ . Since the measurable rectangles is a subset of the measurable cylinders, one contention is done. Is the other one I am having trouble with. I suspect it has something to do with the ""good sets principle"" (exposed in the book) since I'm not very good at using it.",['measure-theory']
4677120,Understanding $1$-forms as 'onions',"I stumbled across this paper providing an intuition of differential forms. On page $3$ the paper reads ""Think of a vector as a pin and a one-form as an onion. You evaluate a one-form on a vector by counting how many onion layers it goes through. More generally we represent a one-form on an $n$ -manifold by drawing $(n − 1)$ -dimensional surfaces on it. We call these surfaces leaves . In the general case we can still count how many of these leaves each vector goes through. [...] This picture makes it easy to integrate a one-form."" I understand the definition of a $k$ -form, as well as this (different?) interpretation of them, yet the phrase ""You evaluate a one-form on a vector by counting how many onion layers it goes through"" remains a mystery to me. What does the quoted passage mean?","['differential-forms', 'definition', 'intuition', 'differential-geometry']"

4677160,Understanding blowups at nonreduced loci,"Blowing up at a reduced subscheme is geometrically clear to me: it is just like blowing up at a reduced point, and point on the exceptional divisor corresponds to different tangent lines through the base point. However, I always have problem understanding blowing up at a nonreduced subscheme. Is it a geometric way to see it as the reduced cases? As examples, I would like to ask the following questions: Consider the blowup of $\mathbb A^2$ at a double point $x={\rm Spec}(k[x,y]/(x^2,y))$ . What is the exceptional divisor? Is it isomorphic to $\mathbb P^1$ ? Is the blowup smooth? (By the comment of mtrying46, the exceptional divisor is $\mathbb P^1$ but the blow up is not smooth) Consider that first blow up $\mathbb A^2$ at one point and then blow up at one point in the exceptional divisor of the blowup. The composition can be seen as blow up once (at a nonreduced center). Then what is the center? From the two examples above, it seems that blowup at nonreduced center will either result in singularity or central fiber not being projective space. I would like to know whether this is true in general. That is: Suppose $Y$ is the blow up of $X$ at $Z\subset X$ and both $X,Y$ are smooth. If we know every fiber of $Z$ is isomorphic to some $\mathbb P^m$ , can we conclude that $Z$ is reduced? Everything is over $\mathbb C$ . Any comments will be very helpful!","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'blowup']"

Then $X_n \to X$ almost surely if and only if every subsequence has a further subsequence converging almost surely to $X$ . However, given any subsequence $X_{n_k}$ we have $X_{n_k}\to X$ in probability so that $X_{n_k}$ has a subsequence converging to $X$ almost surely. Hence $X_n\to X$ almost surely.
