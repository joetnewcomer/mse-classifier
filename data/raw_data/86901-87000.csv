1156374,Confusion about basic Kahler geometry,"I am really struggling to understand the basics of Kahler geometry and hope someone can give me some guidance.
Suppose we have a complex manifold with some complex structure $J$ and let $g$ be a Hermitian metric. That is, $g$ is a Riemannian metric and satisfies the extra condition $g(JX,JY)=g(X,Y)$ . So we have a Riemannian manifold $(M^{2n},g)$ . Why do we all of a sudden start considering the complexified tangent space? What good does that do? The metric $g$ is of the form $$g=\sum_{i,j=1}^{2n}g_{ij}E^i\otimes E^j,$$ where $\{E^1,\dots, E^{2n}\}=\{dx^1,dy^1,\dots, dx^n, dy^n\}$ . We introduce $\frac{\partial}{\partial z_k}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial \overline z_k}$ and $dz_k$ and $d\overline z_k$ and then extend the metric to $TM^\mathbb{C}$ and start doing all these computations. But by doing this we've completely changed the domain of the metric. One metric is in $\Omega^2_\mathbb{C}(M)$ and the other is in $\Omega^2(M)$ . How is this new metric telling us stuff about the original one? What is the relationship between the matrix $g_{k\overline j}$ , where $1\leq j,k\leq n$ and $g_{jk}$ , where $1\leq j,k\leq 2n$ ? We introduce the 'extended' connection and curvature but again, I don't see how this new information tells us something about the original manifold. For example, apparently the 'extended' definition of Ricci curvature on $TM^\mathbb{C}$ is the same as the Ricci curvature on $(M^{2n},g)$ . How can these two things be the same, they are functions on completely different spaces?? Another example I am struggling with is how the Kahler form $\omega$ satisfies $\frac{\omega^n}{n!}=\text{vol}_M$ . We have $\omega=\sqrt{-1}g_{j\overline k}dz^j\wedge d\overline z^k$ an element of $\Omega^2_\mathbb{C}(M)$ . How can this be raised to powers to give an element of $\Omega^{2n}(M)$ ?? Really any help would be greatly appreciated!","['differential-geometry', 'kahler-manifolds']"
1156384,Definition of Euclidean domain [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Why is $v(a) \leq v(ab)$ superfluous in Euclidean domain definition? (2 answers) Closed 4 years ago . Today we learned about Euclidean domains in class but I don't understand why we need one of the conditions stated in the definition. We called an integral domain $R$ a Euclidean domain if there exists a function $f$ from $R$ to strictly positive integers such that: 1) For $a,b$ non zero in $R$, $f(ab)\ge f(a)$. 2) If $a,b\in R$, $b\neq 0$, then we can write $a=bq+r$ with $q,r\in R$ such that either $r=0$ or $f(r)<f(b)$. So from what I understand the whole point of a Euclidean domain is to be able to define a Euclidean algorithm, but I don't see why (1) is needed. Furthermore later in the class we proved a Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain and in the proof we didn't use the property (1), so my question is: Why do we need (1) in the definition? Thanks in advance.","['euclidean-domain', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'definition']"
1156389,$\zeta(2)=\frac{\pi^2}{6}$ proof improvement.,"Recently in one of my calculus exercise I have made out a (quite novel to me) proof for $\zeta(2)=\frac{\pi^2}{6}$ via the famous infinite product below:
$$\sin(x)=x\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}(1-\frac{x^2}{i^2\pi^2})\tag{0}$$
I feel that the proof which I am to give below should count as one proper way to compute $\zeta(2)$ apart from the others (usually very complicated and requiring advanced knowledge) .I think this proof is more accessible to students who are learning very basic calculus and analysis (me, for example). Therefore, I want to improve this proof so that it can really hold water, and as a greenhand at analysis and caculus I need to seek help from this site to improve this proof, which I cannot finish alone. Any help will be appreciated.Thanks in advance. Here goes the proof: From $(0)$ we immediately know that $\forall x\ne0$
$$\frac{\sin(x)}{x}=\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}(1-\frac{x^2}{i^2\pi^2})\tag{1}$$
Now let $y=x^2>0$ and rewrite $(1)$ as
$$\frac{\sin(\sqrt y)}{\sqrt y}=\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}(1-\frac{y}{i^2\pi^2})\tag{2}$$
For RHS in $(2)$, we may as well regard it as a ""polynomial"" with an infinite order and also infinitely many terms.Let's just call it $P(y)$. It is then obvious that all the solutions for $P(y)=0$ are as follows:
$$y_i=i^2\pi^2$$
where $i\in\mathbb N^+$. Apparently they are distinct. Now consider a finite polynomial 
$$P_n(y)=a_0+a_1 y+a_2 y^2+\cdots+a_{n-1}y^{n-1}+a_ny^n$$
Let $P_n(y)=0$, since $y>0$, it is ok to divide both sides by $y^n$, which yields
$$a_0 \Bigl(\frac1y\Bigr)^n+a_1\Bigl(\frac1y\Bigr)^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}\Bigl(\frac1y\Bigr)+a_n=0\tag{3}$$
For each $y_i$ that is a solution to $P_n(y)=0$, $\frac{1}{y_i}$ will also be a solution to $(3)$ if we regard $(3)$ as a polynomial in terms of $\frac1y$. Therefore, by applying  the fundamental theorem of algebra to $(3)$ we get
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{y_i}=-\frac{a_1}{a_0}\tag{4}$$
in which $y_i$s are distinct roots for $P_n(y)=0$. Then comes the key part, and that's also where I want more clarity on some issues . Let's return to $P(y)$, then infinite polynomial. By analogue, $(4)$ also holds for $P(y)$ ( clarification needed here!! ). Therefore,
$$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{i^2\pi^2}=-\frac{a_1}{a_0}\tag{5}$$
in which $y_i=i^2\pi^2$ are distinct roots for $P(y)=0$ and $a_0$, $a_1$ are respectively the ""constant"" and ""coefficient for $y^1$"" in $P(y)$. To calculate $a_0$ and $a_1$, we must use limits since they are in a limit sense themselves. First, we have 
$$a_0=\lim_{y\to 0}P(y)=\lim_{y\to 0}\frac{\sin\sqrt y}{\sqrt y}=1\tag{6}$$
Then we go on to calculate $a_1$, recall what we do with a finite polynomial, then by analogue it should be
$$a_1=\lim_{y \to 0}\frac{P(y)-a_0}{y}=\lim_{y \to 0}\frac{\frac{\sin\sqrt y}{\sqrt y}-1}{y}=\frac{-\frac16 y+o(y)}{y}=-\frac16\tag{7}$$
(Intuitively I find $(6)$ and $(7)$ acceptable, but I also want some clarification so that they can be convincing.) Hence, at long last

1156482,"The action of a group on a set, and the size of an orbit.","This question may be easy to solve with an example, but I am not able to think of any. Let's say that you have a group G, and a subgroup H, it is show that a the cosets $(aH), a \in G$, form an equivalence relation, so they partition G, but the interesting part in this case is that every part of the partition has the same amount of elements. But let's say you have a set X, which is not a group, but you have a group G, that acts on the group X. Formally this means that: $gx\in X, \forall g \in G, \forall x \in X$ $ex=x, \forall x \in X$ $(g_1g_2)x=g_1(g_2x)$. It can be show that the relation $x_1$~$x_2$, if there is a g such that $gx_1=x_2$, exists. Hence since we have an equivalence relation we get a partition of X, and we call these partitions for orbits in X under G . My question is: Are these orbits/partitions of the same size like in the coset case?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
1156537,"Tensor product notation for $(x,y)\mapsto f(x)g(y)$","I often stumbled across (variations of) the notation $f\otimes g$ for $(x,y)\mapsto f(x)g(x)$. If $f\in V^*$, $g\in W^*$ for vector spaces $V,W$ over ${\bf K}$ then $f\otimes g:x\otimes y\mapsto f(x)g(y)$ is the standard definition of the tensor product of linear maps where we associate ${\bf K}\otimes{\bf K}$ with ${\bf K}$ in the canonical way. But sometimes I read this in contexts where $f,g$ are not linear functionals, e.g. $f,g\in{\cal C}^\infty(\Omega)$ for $\Omega\subseteq{\bf R}^n$, here I always thought $f\otimes g$ denotes an element in ${\cal C}^\infty(\Omega)\otimes{\cal C}^\infty(\Omega)$, but I could not prove that ${\cal C}^\infty(\Omega)\otimes {\cal C}^\infty(\Omega)$ is a subset of ${\cal C}^\infty(\Omega\times\Omega)$, i.e. the space where $(x,y)\mapsto f(x)g(y)$ lives in. So is this just a notational convention derived from the case of linear functionals, or is there something more subtle going on which I'm not able to see yet?","['notation', 'tensor-products', 'linear-algebra']"

For acute triangles, orthocenter and circumcenter are inside the triangle, for right triangles both are at the border, and for obtuse triangles both are outside.

Problem: A function $f\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is zero almost everywhere iff $f(n)=0$ for all except a finite number of arguments. It can be shown that the set of functions that are zero almost everywhere is enumerable. Attempt: Let $E=\{f\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\mid f \text{ is zero almost everywhere}\}$. Let $Q\colon \mathbb{N}\to E$ such that $Q(n)=f_n$ where we define $f_n(x)=0$ for all but $n\in\mathbb{N}$ values. Fix $f\in E$, then we need show that there exists some integer $n\in N $ such that $f=f_n$, but by defnition $f$ is zero almost everywhere, so $f(x)=0$ for all but a finite  $r\in\mathbb{N}$ values. Choose $n=r$. I realize that this is a incorrect proof, but I'm not really sure where.

1156854,Proving that a family of functions converges to the Dirac delta.,"For each $\epsilon > 0$, define $f_\epsilon:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ as follows:
\begin{align}
  f_\epsilon(k) = \frac{1}{\pi}\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon^2+k^2}.
\end{align}
How does one rigorously show (in the sense of distributions) that $f_\epsilon(k) \to \delta(k)$ as $\epsilon\to 0$? I think I have the essential structure of an argument using contour integration, but it's missing some details that I don't have the expertise to fill in. For each $a>0$, let $C_a$ be the CCW contour consisting of a straight segment between $-a$ and $a$ on the real axis, and a semicircular segment in the upper half plane of radius $a$.  Then morally speaking, I'd hope the following steps are correct:
\begin{align}
  \lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_\epsilon(k)\varphi(k)\, dk
&= \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \lim_{a\to\infty}\int_{C_a} \frac{1}{\pi}\frac{\epsilon}{(z-i\epsilon)(z+i\epsilon)}\varphi(z) \, dz \\
&= \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} (2\pi i) \frac{1}{\pi}\frac{\epsilon}{(i\epsilon + i\epsilon)}\varphi(i\epsilon) \\
&= \varphi(0)
\end{align}
However, I'm most concerned about the details of extending the test function $\varphi$ to a sufficiently nice function on $\mathbb C$ in order to perform the contour integration.   In the book I'm studying, a test function is defined as a function in $C^\infty(\mathbb R)$ such that it and all its derivatives are $O(|x|^{-N})$ for all $N$ as $|x|\to\infty$. Does any test function have a nice continuation to $\mathbb C$ that makes the above steps valid?  Perhaps there is a way of doing this without contour integration so that one doesn't have to worry about continuation? Edit. I was made aware by Mister Benjamin Dover below that there is in fact a quite general way to argue convergence to $\delta$ without complex analysis.  I'm most interested at this point in determining if there is some way to make my manipulation above rigorous -- those sorts of arguments abound in the physics literature.","['distribution-theory', 'complex-analysis']"

Here, $p_A=6$. Let's also define $p_{A1}$ the number of $A$'s in the first interval in the pattern. Here, $p_{A1}=1$.) Simple example : with $X=\{A, B, C\}$ and $n=8$. The question is: how many eight-letter words with an $A$ in the third position have a (relative) majority of $A$'s and the pattern $BABCA$? And how many have a (relative) majority of $B$'s? Solution for the simple example : The fixed $A$ cannot be in the second $A$-interval in the pattern: $A$ is the last letter in the pattern, and so the fixed $A$ can be followed only by other $A$'s and the pattern would not be reproduced. Still, in general cases, the fixed $A$ could be in different intervals. Once we have decided that $A$ is in the first interval, we iterate on $k$, the number of $A$-letter in the word. There must be at least one in each interval, thus at least two in this example. With $k=2$ and $k=3$, there are no possible outcome, since there would be $k$ $A$'s letters and $k-1$ other letters ($B$ and $C$). Since there are only three letters, we cannot make an 8-letter word ($2+1*2, 3+2*2 \leq 8$). With $k=4$, the 7 possible outcomes are: $BAAABBCA$ $BAAABCCA$ $BAABBCAA$ $BAABCCAA$ $BBABCAAA$ $BBAABCAA$ $BBAAABCA$ With $k=5$, there are 3 possible outcomes: $BAAAABCA$ $BAAABCAA$ $BAABCAAA$ There are no possibilities with $k=6$ (no room to reproduce the pattern: 8 letters in total, minus 6 $A$'s, 2 spaces remaining, but 3 non-$A$ occurrences in the pattern). So in total, there are 10 possibilities for this simple example. How can I start to solve this problem using analytic combinatorics? I'm looking for a general expression for any pattern.

$$\frac{pq + 1}{p+q},$$

$$pq + 1 = r(p+q),$$
which is equivalent to
$$(p-r)(q-r) = (r-1)(r+1).$$
The problem is that the right hand side tends to be highly composite (indeed, if $r > 3$ then the right hand side is always divisible by $24$), so there should be lots of choices for the primes $p,q$ that appear on the left hand side. Are there infinitely many primes $r$ which admits this representation? Are there infinitely many primes which do not have such a representation?

Then, I began to consider the same problem for the other polynomials. Among some polynomials, $f(x)=(x+1)^n-x^n$ is the one that I can't grasp. So, here is my question. Question : For a given odd prime $p$, how can we find every positive integer $n$ satisfying the following condition? Condition : For $f(x)=(x+1)^n-x^n$, 
  $$\{f(0),f(1),f(2),\cdots,f(p-1)\}\equiv \{0,1,2,\cdots,p-1\}\pmod p.$$ Remark : We want that $f(x)$ covers all the residue classes $\pmod p$. The condition is not $f(x)\equiv x\pmod p$. I conjecture that the answer is $n=(p-1)m+2\ \ (m=0,1,2,\cdots)$, but I'm facing difficulty in proving that. Maybe I'm missing something important... Can anyone help?

This is equivalent to asking, for every section $g\in G(S)$, does there exist a section $p\in P(S)$ such that $f(S)\circ p = g$ ? Edit: In particular I'm thinking of the situation where in addition to the above, $S$ is connected with geometric point $s$ and $P$ is an inverse limit of finite etale group schemes over $S$, so we can think of $P$ as a profinite group $P_s$ with $\pi_1(S,s)$ acting on it via group automorphisms, and $G$ as a finite group $G_s$ with the trivial action of $\pi_1(S,s)$. Similarly, $f$ is then just a group homomorphism $P_s\rightarrow G_s$ respecting the $\pi_1(S,s)$-action, so the equation is, does every preimage $f^{-1}(g)$ for $g\in G_s$ contain a $\pi_1(S,s)$-invariant element? Intuition: The preimages  $f^{-1}(g)$ should be all isomorphic (I believe this statement is true for abelian schemes, and in general one would think that group schemes are ""locally the same everywhere"").

By the inverse function theorem, $z=f(w)=we^{w}$ is not invertible in the neighborhood of a point where $f'(w) = e^{w}(1+w)=0$. So $f(w)$ is not invertible in the neighborhood of $w=-1$. The principal branch of the Lambert W function assumes the value $-1$ at the point $z= -\frac{1}{e}$.  And by choice of closure, $W_{-1}(-\frac{1}{e})=-1$. The branch $W_{1}(z)$ does not include any portion of the real axis. So why then does $W_{1}(z)$ have a branch point at $z= -\frac{1}{e}$ when $W_{1}(-\frac{1}{e}) \ne -1$? EDIT : Sources that state $W_{1}(z)$ has a branch point at $z = - \frac{1}{e}$ include Wolfram Alpha , Maple , and this paper (page 17).

Solving the homogeneous case using the concept of eigenvalue and eigenvector I got $c_1(1,1)e^t$ and $c_2(1,1)e^t$. So the general solution is $c_1(1,1)e^t+c_2(1,1)e^t$. But I am in doubt,my question is am I correct? And if I am, what shall I do next to solve the non homogeneous case? A detailed answer is highly appreciated.","['linear-algebra', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
1158259,What is the maximum area two non intersecting circles can cover if they are contained in a unit square?,"What is the maximum area two non intersecting circles can cover if they are contained in a unit square? I think that they cover the most area when in the following position: However I haven't been able to prove this is the best possible way. In this configuration the large circle has radius $\frac{1}{2}$ and the small circle has radius $\frac{\sqrt2 -1}{2\sqrt{2}+2}$. So the sum of the areas is approximately $0.808$ I have an Idea as to how to prove it is maximum. Prove the two vertices must be on the diagonal and then do some algebraic inequalities. But I'd like to see a clean-cut proof, because I have come across this type of problem before and I often write sloppy solutions for them.","['geometry', 'contest-math']"

1158277,Square root-related calculations with matrices,"If $\mathbf A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix such that $\mathbf A^6 = \mathbf I_n$ (the identity matrix), is it true that either $\mathbf A^3 = \mathbf I_n$ or $\mathbf A^3 = \mathbf -I_n$? I'm struggling to solve this question. I re-wrote $\mathbf A^3$ as $\mathbf B$, which gives $\mathbf B^2 = \mathbf I_n$.
I do know that, if $\mathbf B^2 = \mathbf I_n$, then it is not necessarily true that $\mathbf B = \pm\mathbf I$ (I had a look at the following link, though I haven't fully understood the explanations given: If $A^2 = I$ (Identity Matrix) then $A = \pm I$ ). Can I (and if so, how do I) apply this fact to the case where $\mathbf B$ is the cube of another matrix $\mathbf A$?",['matrices']
1158292,"Equation for Tangent Line that passes through $(0,1)$ on the curve $y = \ln x$","I'm totally lost. I've been trying to figure this out.
This is what I've figured out: $dy/dx = 1/x$ $y$-intercept $= 1$ So I try to do $y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)+b,$ which I get as $y-1 = 1/x(x-0)+1,$ simplified to $y = 3.$ But I feel like that is totally wrong and well, obviously it isn't even an equation really.

1158304,CDF of middle of $3$ random variables,"Let the independent random variables $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ have the same cdf $F(X).$
Let $Y$ be the middle value (second largest) of $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$. Determine the cdf of  $Y$. (Hint: use a Binomial distribution). My approach is that this is a binomial distribution where I am trying to calculate the probability that $2$ of that random variables are less than or equal to some number $x$ and one is of the random variables is larger. Is this the right approach?","['statistics', 'order-statistics']"
1158323,"In what sense of ""structure"" do group homomorphisms ""preserve structure""?","It is commonly said that group homomorphisms ""preserve the structure of the group"", e.g., from Wikipedia : The purpose of defining a group homomorphism as it is, is to create functions that preserve the algebraic structure. Now, my default notion of structure is the one that holds that isomorphisms are structural identities---two isomorphic mathematical objects have the same structure. But that notion of structure requires preserving not just the operations on the elements of the domain but also requires the two sets of objects be equipollent. But homomorphisms aren't, in general, reversible---or else they'd be isomorphisms. Since homomorphisms don't preserve size, in what sense does it preserve ""structure""? Is there any more to the notion of structure here than the simple definition of algebraic structure as a set endowed with certain operations? Toy example illustrating the problem: suppose you have a group homomorphism between groups $G$ and $H$ (but no isomorphism). Suppose also that you have an isomorphism between $G$ and some further group $J$. Since there is a homomorphism between $G$ and $H$, the structure in $G$ is preserved in $H$. Since there is an isomorphism between $G$ and $J$ they have the same structure. But presumably if $H$ preserves the structure of $G$ then they have the same structure. That can't be true, though, since they aren't isomorphic. It seems then that either ""structure"" means two different things when discussing isomorphisms and homomorphisms, or ""preserves"" doesn't mean that the homomorphic sets have the same structure (and then I have no idea what ""preserves"" actually means in this context). I'm clearly confused about something. I'm just not sure what. TL;DR What is the difference between the notions of ""structure"" when you say that isomorphic structures have the same structure and when you say that a group homomorphism preserves the group structure?","['terminology', 'group-theory', 'model-theory']"
1158389,How to solve linear ODE? $e^{x^2}$ messing it up.,"How do you solve the ODE $\frac{dy}{dx} + 2xy = x^2$?
It's a linear equation with $P(x)=2x$ but that mean the integrating factor $e^{\int P(x) dx} = e^{x^2}$ which is really bad because then you integrate $\int x^2e^{x^2}$ which I'm not sure is possible to integrate? By the way, I know there is some way to integrate $e^{x^2}$ involving spherical coordinates. I can't find any examples but if someone has a link to an explanation can they share it? Given the context the question appeared in it is unlikely we were expected to integrate difficult functions (the focus was on ODEs) but maybe there was a typo in the question :(","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'integration']"
