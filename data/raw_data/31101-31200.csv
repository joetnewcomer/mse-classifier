291959,Do the polynomial germs generate all the ring of germs?,"I'm trying to understand some equality that comes up in stability theory involving sets of germs and I think I need a result like the next one, so if anyone knows anything about this and helps me it would be wonderful! Let $C^{\infty}_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be the ring of germs at $0\in \mathbb{R}^n$ of smooth maps from $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$. We write $[f]\in C^{\infty}_0$ to denote the germ of a smooth function $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, and define the set $$\mathrm{Pol}_k(x_1, \cdots,x_n)=\{x_1^{i_1} x_2^{i_2}\dots x_n^{i_n}\in K[X]\;| \;i_1+i_2+\dots+ i_n=k \},$$ where $K[X]$ is the polynomial ring in $n$ variables. Now, we can think of $C^{\infty}_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$ as a module over itself so the question is, Does the class of all polynomials generate $C^{\infty}_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$? Specifically, is this true? $$C^{\infty}_0(\mathbb{R}^n) = \langle 1,[\mathrm{Pol}_1(x_1,\cdots,x_n)],[\mathrm{Pol}_2(x_1,\cdots,x_n)],\cdots\rangle_{\mathbb{R}}$$ where by $\langle [f_1],\cdots,[f_n]\rangle_{\mathbb{R}} \subset C^{\infty}_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$ we mean the $\mathbb{R}$-submodule generated by $[f_1],\cdots,[f_n]\in C^{\infty}_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$. --I'm sorry I don't think I expressed correctly what I had in mind. Actually what I was trying to ask is something like this: If we denote by $\mathfrak{m}(n)$ the maximal ideal in $C^{\infty}_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$ consisting of elements in $[f]\in C^{\infty}_0(\mathbb{R}^n)$ such that their representatives have $f(0)=0$.

It looks to me that it could be right.

I want to learn Real and Complex Analysis, Measure Theory and all that other good stuff. but I am not exactly sure what book to use. My class used the text An Introduction to Analysis by William R. Wade, although I would consider this book rather easy because it's exercises are quite simple. The homework problems my professor gave were much more difficult and often took problems from Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis book.  Another thing worth mention is that the whole reason I got into math was from reading about the first half of Micheal Spivak's Calculus completely on my own. So (I think) I can say that I feel more comfortable with the theorem-proof format than most students who went through a class similar to mine. Anyway, I think Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis would probably be too hard for me.

292133,$R$ with an upper bound for degrees of irreducibles in $R[x]$,"One very convenient property of $\mathbb{R}$ as a ring is that there is an upper bound for the degree of irreducible polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x]$, as If $f\in\mathbb{R}[x]$ has degree larger than $2$, then $f$ is reducible. However, the proof as I know depends highly on the fact that $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed, and the very nice property: $z\in\mathbb{C}$ is in $\mathbb{R}$ if and only if $z=\bar{z}$. This makes a generalization to other integral domains rather difficult. So the problem is For what kind of integral domain $R$, we have a finite upper bound on the degree of irreducible elements in $R[x]$? Some most familiar examples are ruled out: in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ and $\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$, there is not such a bound. Unfortunately these exhaust all integral domains about which I have a working knowledge. Another result might help is Eisenstein's criterion and its generalized form , which says if we can find a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ in $R$ such that $\mathfrak{p}^2\neq\mathfrak{p}$, then by picking $a\in\mathfrak{p}^2\backslash\mathfrak{p}$ we have an irreducible $a+x^d$, where $d$ can be arbitrary, and hence the upper bound is not possible. So we only need to focus on domains where $\mathfrak{p}^2=\mathfrak{p}$ for all prime ideals. This seems to be a quite strong restriction but I am not sure what to make of it.

We also know that $ DF' = (DF)^{-1}= \frac{1}{\det DF} \text{adj}(DF) $
but the adjugate is computed in terms of the minors of $DF$, $\det DF$ is constant and thus $DF'$ is given by polynomial functions in its components, in particular $D^k F =0$ for some $k\in \mathbb{N}$. Thus $F'$ is polynomial  because of its Taylor expansion. Since $F'$ is polynomial it is defined on the whole space $\mathbb{C}^n$. Now we have $F' \circ F\mid_U= \text{id}$ for some open neighborhood $U$ of $0$, but this implies $F' \circ F= \text{id}$ since $F' \circ F$ is a polynomial.","['multivariable-calculus', 'linear-algebra', 'analysis']"

   }
\end{align} Specifically $\mathbf{g} \leftarrow c\mathbf{g}+ s\mathbf{h}$, so that row vector $\mathbf{g}$ is mixed with row vector $\mathbf{h}$. Now solving for $c$ and $s$ in the complex numbers that give $x \leftarrow 0$ results in two solutions. Both of which end with the same magnitude in the upper triangular portion
$$\Vert \mathbf{g} \Vert^2 + \Vert \mathbf{b} \Vert^2 \quad\text{is same for both solutions that give $x=0$}$$ I have yet to find the formulation that shows this, but multiple experimentation has yet to fail. EDIT I have made a silly mistake in that all tests were done on Hermitian matrices. Now I guess I solved my question, but any discussions or error corrections are welcome... Here is the formula for the rotation: \begin{align}
  \delta &= d_1 - d_0 \\
  \Delta &= \pm\sqrt{\delta^2 + 4xy} \\
  k^2 &= \delta\bar{\delta} + \delta\bar{\Delta} + \bar{\delta}\Delta + \Delta\bar{\Delta} +4y\bar{y}\\
  c & = \frac{2y}{k} \\
  s & = \frac{\delta + \Delta}{k} \\
\end{align} The following is the derivation. Using $d_1 - d_0 = \delta$, the top right element is desired to be zero $$\delta cs + x c^2 - ys^2 = 0$$ Use the substitution $$\alpha = \frac{s}{c}$$ then
\begin{align}
  \delta c^2\alpha + x c^2 - y\alpha^2c^2 = c^2\left(\delta\alpha + x - y\alpha^2\right) = 0
\end{align} The equation $\delta\alpha + x - y\alpha^2=0$ is easily solved using the quadratic formula:
$$ \alpha = \frac{-\delta \pm \sqrt{\delta^2 - 4(-y)x}}{2(-y)} = \frac{\delta \mp \sqrt{\delta^2 + 4xy}}{2y} = \frac{k\cdot s}{k\cdot c}$$
Here $k$ is the real and non-zero scale factor that gives $c\bar{c} + s\bar{s} = 1$. Denote $\Delta = \pm\sqrt{\delta^2 + 4xy}$.  Then we have
\begin{align}
  c &= \frac{2y}{k} \\
  s &= \frac{\delta+\Delta}{k} \\
  s\bar{s} + c\bar{c} &= \frac{(\delta+\Delta)(\bar{\delta} + \bar{\Delta}) + 4y\bar{y}}{k^2} = 1 \\
  \Rightarrow k^2 &= \delta\bar{\delta} + \delta\bar{\Delta} + \bar{\delta}\Delta + \Delta\bar{\Delta} +4y\bar{y}\\
\end{align}
This formulation gives the desired results for both $\pm\Delta$ (as is confirmed with computations). Now looking at the magnitude $\Vert c\mathbf{g}+ s\mathbf{h} \Vert^2 + \Vert  c\mathbf{b}  -s\mathbf{a} \Vert^2$ we have \begin{align}
  \Vert c\mathbf{g}+ s\mathbf{h} \Vert^2 + \Vert c\mathbf{b}  -s\mathbf{a} \Vert^2  = & (c\mathbf{g}+ s\mathbf{h} )(\bar{\mathbf{g}}^\top \bar{c}+ \bar{\mathbf{h}}^\top\bar{s}) \\
  & + (c\mathbf{b} - s\mathbf{a} )(\bar{\mathbf{b}}^\top \bar{c} - \bar{\mathbf{a}}^\top\bar{s})\\
  = & c\bar{c}\mathbf{g}\bar{\mathbf{g}}^\top + s\bar{s}\mathbf{h}\bar{\mathbf{h}}^\top + \bar{c}s\mathbf{h}\bar{\mathbf{g}}^\top + c\bar{s}\mathbf{g}\bar{\mathbf{h}}^\top\\
  & + c\bar{c}\mathbf{b}\bar{\mathbf{b}}^\top + s\bar{s}\mathbf{a}\bar{\mathbf{a}}^\top - \bar{c}s\mathbf{a}\bar{\mathbf{b}}^\top - c\bar{s}\mathbf{b}\bar{\mathbf{a}}^\top \\
  = & c\bar{c}(\underbrace{\mathbf{g}\bar{\mathbf{g}}^\top + \mathbf{b}\bar{\mathbf{b}}^\top}_{\omega}) + s\bar{s}(\underbrace{\mathbf{h}\bar{\mathbf{h}}^\top + \mathbf{a}\bar{\mathbf{a}}^\top}_{\theta}) + \bar{c}s(\underbrace{\mathbf{h}\bar{\mathbf{g}}^\top - \mathbf{a}\bar{\mathbf{b}}^\top}_{\mu}) + c\bar{s}(\underbrace{\mathbf{g}\bar{\mathbf{h}}^\top - \mathbf{b}\bar{\mathbf{a}}^\top}_{\bar{\mu}}) \\
  = & c\bar{c}\omega + s\bar{s}\theta + \bar{c}s\mu + c\bar{s}\bar{\mu}
\end{align} EXPERIMENT SHOWS that this magnitude is constant with choice of $\pm\Delta$ What is even more confounding to me is that when $x=0$ is true already, and the non trivial rotation that retains the zero is performed, in THAT case
the magnitude does indeed change. Yet should it not be the same if the two choices from the original position of $x \ne 0$ give no change? The non-trivial rotation that retains the zero (and which actually gives a diagonal swap $d_0 \leftrightarrow d_1$ and $y \leftarrow \bar{y}$):
\begin{align}
  \delta cs + x c^2 - ys^2 &= s(\delta c + 0 - ys) = 0\\
 \Rightarrow \frac{k\cdot s}{k\cdot c} &= \frac{\delta}{y} \\
 c & = \frac{y}{k} \\
 s & = \frac{\delta}{k} \\
 k^2 & = y\bar{y} + \delta\bar{\delta} \\
\end{align} The magnitude $c\bar{c}\omega + s\bar{s}\theta + \bar{c}s\mu + c\bar{s}\bar{\mu}$ then is
$$\frac{y\bar{y}\omega + \delta\bar{\delta}\theta + \bar{y}\delta\mu + y\bar{\delta}\bar{\mu}}{k^2} =
\frac{y\bar{y}\omega + \delta\bar{\delta}\theta + \bar{y}\delta\mu + y\bar{\delta}\bar{\mu}}{y\bar{y} + \delta\bar{\delta}}$$ The change in the upper triangular norm then is \begin{align}
  & \frac{y\bar{y}\omega + \delta\bar{\delta}\theta + \bar{y}\delta\mu + y\bar{\delta}\bar{\mu}}{y\bar{y} + \delta\bar{\delta}} - \omega \\

2\cos(4x)*\cos(2x)&=2\cos^2(4x)\\\\
\cos(4x)*(\cos(2x)-\cos(4x))&=0\\\\
\cos(4x)*2\sin(3x)*\sin(x)=&0
\end{align}
$$ $\cos(4x) = 0 \implies 4x = \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k \implies \boxed{x=\frac{\pi}{8} + \frac{\pi k}{4}}$ $\sin(3x) = 0 \implies 3x = \pi k \implies \boxed{x=\frac{\pi k}{3}}$ $\sin(x) = 0 \implies \boxed{x=\pi k}$ WRONG And this is the way how I have been tried to solve it (with different approach) and here I need a help to determine where I'm wrong:
$$
\begin{align}
\cos(2x) - \cos(8x) + \cos(6x) &= 1\\
\cos(2x) + \cos(6x) &= 1 + \cos(8x)

$$ Then using this formula: $$\bbox[Beige]{\boxed{\cos\alpha + \cos\beta = 2\cos(\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2}) \cos(\frac{\alpha - \beta}{2})}} \tag{1}$$ $$2\cos(4x)\cos(2x) = 1 + \cos(8x)$$ And then similarly: $$\bbox[Beige]{\boxed{\cos2\alpha=2\cos^2\alpha-1}} \tag{2}$$ $$2\cos(4x)\cos(2x) = 1 + 2\cos^2(4x) - 1$$ After that I subtracted $1$ from $1$ in the right part and divided both right and left parts by $2$: $$\cos(4x)\cos(2x) = \cos^2(4x)$$ Then once again I divided both parts. This time by $\cos(4x)$ and with the aim not to lose a root I checked whether $\cos(4x)$ can be equal to zero. $$\cos(4x) = 0 \implies 4x = \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k \implies \boxed{x=\frac{\pi}{8} + \frac{\pi k}{4}}$$ so here I found the first root. And using formula (2): $$\cos(2x) = \cos(4x) \implies \cos(2x) = 2\cos^2(2x) - 1$$ then I simply introduced new variable and solved quadratic equation: $$u = \cos(2x)$$
$$
2u^2 - u -1 = 0\\
u_1=1, \, u_2=-\frac{1}{2}
$$ So finally: $\cos(2x) = 1 \implies 2x = \pi k \implies \boxed{x=\frac{\pi k}{2}}$ (wrong) $\cos(2x) = -\frac{1}{2} \implies 2x = \pm \frac{2 \pi}{3} + 2\pi k \implies \boxed{x=\frac{\pi}{3} + \pi k}$ (wrong) But none of the two last roots fits to the original equation. And I lost another 2 roots. Where is my mistake? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks for attention.","['trigonometry', 'self-learning']"

292663,Motivation for a new definition of the derivative using the concept of average velocity,"As everyone knows, for a function $ f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} $ and a point $ a \in \mathbb{R} $, we say that the derivative of $ f $ at $ a $ equals $ L $ if and only if
$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} = L.
$$ Now, most textbooks on particle mechanics offer the following recipe for defining the instantaneous velocity of a particle traveling along a straight line. Let $ f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} $ denote the displacement function of a particle traveling along the $ x $-axis, with respect to time. The goal is to define the instantaneous velocity of the particle at time $ t_{0} $. Pick a sequence of non-degenerate bounded closed intervals $ ([a_{n},b_{n}])_{n \in \mathbb{N}} $ such that $ t_{0} \in (a_{n},b_{n}) $ for all $ n \in \mathbb{N} $ and $ \displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} (b_{n} - a_{n}) = 0 $. Compute the sequence of average velocities $ (v_{\text{ave},n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}} $ of the particle over these closed intervals, i.e.,
$$
(v_{\text{ave},n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \left( \frac{f(a_{n}) - f(b_{n})}{a_{n} - b_{n}} \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}.
$$ Define the instantaneous velocity of the particle at time $ t_{0} $ as $ \displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} v_{\text{ave},n} $, if it exists. This recipe is somehow proposing a new definition of the derivative of a function. Let me describe it in precise mathematical terms. Consider $ f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} $. Let $ a \in \mathbb{R} $, and let $ \Lambda $ be the set of non-degenerate bounded closed intervals $ I $ such that $ a \in I^{\circ} $. Define a partial ordering $ \preceq $ on $ \Lambda $ by $ I \preceq J \iff I \supseteq J $ for all $ I,J \in \Lambda $. One can easily verify that $ (\Lambda,\preceq) $ is a directed set. Next, define a net $ \lambda: \Lambda \to \mathbb{R} $ by
  $$
\forall I \in \Lambda: \quad \lambda(I) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \frac{f({\frak{l}}(I)) - f({\frak{r}}(I))}{{\frak{l}}(I) - {\frak{r}}(I)},
$$
  where $ {\frak{l}}(I) $ and $ {\frak{r}}(I) $ denote the left- and right-endpoints of $ I $ respectively. Then define
  $$
f'(a) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \lim_{I \in \Lambda} \lambda(I),
$$
  if it exists. Question: How can we show that this new definition of the derivative agrees with the usual one?","['calculus', 'order-theory', 'definition', 'real-analysis', 'derivatives']"
292664,"estimate population percentage within an interval, given a small sample","Given a small sample from a normally-distributed population, how  do I calculate the confidence that a specified percentage of the population is within some bounds [A,B]? To make it concrete, if I get a sample of [50,51,52] from a normally-distributed set, I should be able to calculate a fairly high confidence that 50% of the population lies within the range of 0-100, even with such a small sample. This is certainly related to the ""tolerance interval"", but differs in an important way. In all of the examples I can find for tolerance intervals, the required percentile and confidence is given, and the interval is found. In my problem, the interval and percentile are given, and I need to find the confidence. The relevant equation is this one: (Guttman 1970) $$1 - \gamma = P\left[P(X \geqq t_0) \geqq 1 - p\right] = P\left[T_{n-1}^*(\sqrt n z_p) \leqq \sqrt n K\right]$$ With definitions: $1 - \gamma$ is the confidence $n$ is the number of samples $100p$ is the percentage of the population required to be within the interval, as estimated from the sample mean and sample variance. $t_0 = x - K_{S, z_p}$ is the $(1 - p) 100$th percentile of the standard normal distribution $T_v^*(\delta)$ is the noncentral Student’s t distribution with $v$ degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter $\delta$. This solves the one-sided problem, but I'm having trouble extending this to the two-sided problem. In confidence-interval land, I'd use the fact that $P(t_1 \leqq X \leqq t_2) = 1 - P(t_1 \gt X) - P(X \gt t_2)$, to break this into two one-sided problems, but in tolerance-interval land I need to relate these back to the confidence ($1-\gamma$), and I don't see how. $$1 - \gamma = P\left[P(t_1 \geqq X \geqq t_2) \geqq 1 - p\right] = ??? $$ If I attempt to turn this into two one-sided problems: $$1 - \gamma = P\left[1 - P(t_1 \lt X) - P(X \lt t_2) \geqq 1 - p\right] = ??? $$ And I'm utterly stuck there. I don't see how to relate this back to the one-sided tolerance interval solution. I'm not certain this is useful for people to understand the question, but it might, so I'm putting it in this addenda. In scipy, I'm able to pretty easily calculate $K$ given $p$ $\gamma$ and $n$ as: def K(p, gamma, n):
    from scipy import stats
    return stats.nct.ppf(1-gamma, n-1, sqrt(n) * stats.norm.ppf(1-p)) / sqrt(n) I'm also able to find $\gamma$ given $K$ $p$ and $n$ as: def gamma(p, n, K):
    from scipy import stats                                                                                              
    z_p = stats.norm.ppf(1-p)
    return 1 - stats.nct.cdf(sqrt(n) * K, n-1, sqrt(n) * z_p) Much less important, but is this a valid simplification of the Guttman's formula? $$1 - \gamma = P\left[P(X \geqq t_0) \geqq 1 - p\right] = P\left[T_{n-1}^*(\sqrt n z_p) \leqq \sqrt n K\right]$$
$$\gamma = P\left[P(X \geqq t_0) \lt 1 - p\right] = P\left[T_{n-1}^*(\sqrt n z_p) \gt \sqrt n K\right]$$
$$\gamma = P\left[P(X \lt t_0) \lt p\right] = P\left[T_{n-1}^*(\sqrt n z_p) \gt \sqrt n K\right]$$ If so, this form seems way easier to understand, to me.","['statistics', 'sampling', 'probability-distributions']"

In order to do so, only comparisons are allowed. The result of a comparison is one of $\leq,\geq,=$. Comparisons are allowed between elements of $T$ or between $x$ and an element of $T$. How many comparisons are needed in the worst case to find $x$ (asymptotically)? Obviously, you can't do better than $O(\log n)$ comparisons because each comparison gives $O(1)$ bits of information, while there are $O(\log n)$ bits of information in the pair $i,j$. On the other hand, the best algorithm I could think of to find $x$ uses $O(n)$ comparisons. It works as follows: $i \leftarrow 1, j \leftarrow n$ While $T_{ij} \neq x$: a. If $T_{ij} < x$ Then $i \leftarrow i+1$ b. If $T_{ij} > x$ Then $j \leftarrow j-1$ Return $i,j$ In each iteration we rule out either a row or a column, so we are done after $O(n)$ comparisons. Can we close the gap between $O(\log n)$ and $O(n)$?","['algorithms', 'combinatorics']"

Attempt so far: for : $s_{f,m} := \frac{1}{2} a_{0} + \sum_{n=1}^{m} (a_{n}cos(nt)+b_{n}sin(nt))$ the Bessel equality is : $$||f - S_{f,m} ||^2 = ||f||^2 - [\frac{1}{2}a_{0}^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{m} (a_{k}^2 + b_{k}^2)]$$ and the Parseval equality is given by: $$\frac{1}{2} a_{0}^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (a_{k}^2 + b_{k}^2) = || f||^2 $$ where  $||f|| = (f,f)^{1/2} = (\int_{0}^{2\pi}f^2)^{1/2}$ $$||t||^2 = \int_{0}^{2\pi}t^2dt = \frac{8}{3}\pi^3, ||t^2||^2=\int_{0}^{2\pi}t^4 dt = \frac{32}{5}\pi^5$$ I don't see how to continue from here if this is correct at all","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

Then $f$ is a homomorphism precisely when the graph of $f$ is a subgroup of the direct product $G \times H$. Motivation . It has been proven elsewhere that if we replace the instances of the word ""groups"" with the word ""vector spaces"", and if we replace ""homomorphism"" with ""linear map,"" and ""subgroup"" with ""linear subspace"" then the conjecture is true.
