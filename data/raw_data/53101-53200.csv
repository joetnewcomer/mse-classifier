561076,"Is $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n+1}/a_n=L \implies \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt [n] {a_n}=L$ true? If not, is there a counter example? [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Limit of ${a_n}^{1/n}$ is equal to $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_{n+1}/a_n$ (3 answers) Closed 10 years ago .

Which goes as follows: if $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=L$ then $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt [n] {a_n}=L$. In a previous question I asked: This limit: $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt [n] {nk \choose n}$. I was told that this fact is not true.
My question is, can anyone think of a counter example for it?

561092,"Almost uniform convergence of $f_n(x) = x^n$ on the interval $[0, 1]$?","Consider $f_n(x) = x^n$ on the interval $[0, 1]$. This converges pointwise to
$$f = \begin{cases} 0, & \mbox{if } 0 \le x < 1\ \\ 1, & \mbox{if } x = 1 \end{cases}$$ Now I know $f_n(x)$ doesn't converge uniformly to $f$ but does it converge almost uniformly? For any $\delta > 0$ we can can take the subset $(1 - \epsilon, 1]$ of $[0, 1]$ such that $\epsilon < \delta$. Then as the measure of this subset is $\epsilon < \delta$ and $f_n(x)$ converges to $f$ on the complement of this subset we have almost uniform convergence.

561200,"Finding $a_n$ such that $x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}+a_n$ cannot be factored when $a_1,\cdots,a_{n-1}$ given","Let $n\ge 4\in\mathbb N$. Suppose that $a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_{n-1}$ are given integers. Then, here is my question. Question : Is the following true for any $(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_{n-1})$ ? There exists a composite $a_n$ such that $f(x)=x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+a_2x^{n-2}+\cdots+a_{n-1}x+a_n$ cannot be factored using integer coefficients. Motivation : I've known the following theorem : Theorem : There exit such prime number $a_n$ for any $(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_{n-1})$. Then, I got interested in the case that $a_n$ is not a prime number. The answer must be YES, but I can't prove that. Can anyone help? In the following, I'm going to write the proof for the above theorem. Proof for theorem : Let $a_n$ be a prime number. If $f(x)$ can be factored, then we can write
$$\begin{align}f(x)&=x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_n\\
&=(x^m+b_1x^{m-1}+\cdots+b_m)\cdot (x^{n-m}+c_1x^{n-m-1}+\cdots+c_{n-m})\\
&=g(x)\cdot h(x)\ \ \ \ \ (|b_m|\le|c_{n-m}|)\end{align}$$
Since $b_m\cdot c_{n-m}=a_n=\text{a prime number}$, we know that $b_m=\pm 1.$
Letting $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\cdots,\alpha_m$ be the solutions of $g(x)=0$, since we can write $g(x)=(x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)\cdots (x-\alpha_m),$ we know that $(-1)^m\alpha_1\alpha_2\cdots\alpha_m=b_m.$ If $|\alpha_1|\gt 1,|\alpha_2|\gt 1,\cdots,|\alpha_m|\gt 1$, then $|b_m|=|\alpha_1||\alpha_2|\cdots |\alpha_m|\gt 1,$ which is a contradiction. Hence, we know that there exists $\alpha$ such that $f(\alpha)=0, |\alpha|\lt 1$. Hence, we get
$$\begin{align}|a_n|&=|{\alpha}^n+a_1{\alpha}^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}\alpha|\\
& \le |\alpha|^n+|a_1|\cdot |\alpha|^{n-1}+\cdots+|a_{n-1}|\cdot |\alpha|\\
&\le 1+|a_1|+\cdots+|a_{n-1}|\end{align}$$
Hence, we can take a prime number which is larger than $1+|a_1|+\cdots+|a_{n-1}|$ as $a_n$ in order that $f(x)$ cannot be factored using integer coefficients. We now know that the proof is completed.","['factoring', 'polynomials', 'number-theory']"

561238,Determine continuity and differentiability,"Could you tell me how to determine continuity and differentiability of functions with two or more variables? I know how to do it for fairly simple functions, such as $f(x,y)=\sqrt{x^k + y^k}$, $f(x,y)=\sin (x^k + y^k)$ and for polynomials continuity is obvious. We check if the function and its partial derivatives are continuous. For functions for which it is evident that they are a composition of continuous functions, it is easy to establish continuity. I have problems determining continuity of more ambitious functions, say $f(x,y)  = \sqrt{xy}(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})^{-1}$ for $(x,y)$ in the domain of this function and $f(x,y) = 0$  elsewhere.

561247,Do there exist double points on a surface in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^3$ that are not rational?,"The title explains it all. I'm familiar with the du val singularities on surfaces, also apparently known as rational double points ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_Val_singularity ). In http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masda/surf/more/DuVal.pdf 2.1, du val singularities are characterized as those isolated double points that admit a resolution that is given by stepwise blowup of isolated double points. My question now is whether other type of multiplicity two points exist, i.e. nonrational double points? If so, can they occur on a surface embedded in $\mathbb{P}^3$? Due to Reids characterization i would say these are isolated double points such that somewhere in the blowup process either a singular point of multiplicity $>2$ or a singular curve appears. This would seem weird to me, but perhaps my intuition is not correct in this case. Thanks!","['surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'singularity-theory', 'complex-geometry']"

  and
  $$\dim V=\dim \, U_1 + \dots + \dim \, U_m.\tag{2.21}$$
  Then $V = U_1 \oplus \dots \oplus U_m.$ Proof: Choose a basis for each $U_j$. Put these bases together in one list, forming a list that spans $V$ (by $2.20$) and has length $\dim V$ (by $2.21$). Thus this list is a basis of $V$ (by $2.16$), and in particular it is linearly independent. Now suppose that $u_1 \in U_1,...,u_m \in U_m$ are such that $0=u_1+ ··· +u_m$. We can write each $u_j$ as a linear combination of the basis vectors (chosen above) of $U_j$.

Now assume that, we slightly relax the second constraint and change it to: If $A(i,j)>0$ then $A(i,j)\geq\min\{A(i,k),A(k,j)\} \forall i,j,k$ In words, the second constraint only holds for non-zero entries. Also for simplicity we can assume that the diagonal of $A$ is all $1$, and other entries are less than $1$. My question is can we say any of the following about $A^{-1}$: $A^{-1}$ is diagonally dominant. $A^{-1}(i,i) > \sum_{k\neq i, A(i,k)>0} |A^{-1}(i,k)|$ Specially I think the second one should be true.

$$

This is an example where $\lim E(X_n) \neq E( \lim X_n)$, and the dominated convergence theorem doesn't apply because $X_n$ can't be dominated by an integral random variable. I can see intuitively that this random variable can't be dominated by an integrable random variable; $X(\omega) = 1/\omega$ ""connects the dots"" and its expectation isn't finite. However, how could one prove that $X_n$ can't possibly dominated by an integrable random variable? I was thinking about a proof by contradiction, but I didn't succeed. I suppose that one way to prove it is by saying that since 1) $\lim E(X_n) \neq E( \lim X_n)$, 2) $X_n \rightarrow 0$, and 3) DCT doesn't apply, we can't have domination (the result doesn't follow, so at least one premise of the DCT must be false, which in this case is domination).

Prove that $A$ is self-adjoint. That is, prove that $(Ax,y) = (x, Ay)$ for all $x,y \in \mathcal{H}$ . Here's what I have so far. Because $A$ is positive we have $\mathbb{R} \ni (Ax,x) = \overline{(x,Ax)} = (x,Ax)$ , all $x \in \mathcal{H}$ .

561803,"$Df(x)=0$ for a differentiable function $f$ from $A \subset R^n$ to $R^m$ with $A$ open and connected, then $f$ is constant","Let $A \subset R^n$ open and connected and let $f:A \to R^m$ a differentiable function. If $Df(x)=0$ for every $x \in A$, then f is constant in $A$. This is what I did up to now: Take $x_1, x_2 \in A$ such that the line segment that joins these two points is also in $A$. Define $\phi:[0,1] \to R^n$ as $\phi(t)=(1-t)x_1+x_2$. Then, $f(x_2)-f(x_1)= \int_0^1 \frac{d}{dt} f \circ \phi(t)dt=\int_0^1 D(\phi(t)).\phi'(t)dt$. But $D(\phi(t))=0$, which means $\int_0^1 D(\phi(t)).\phi'(t)dt=\int_0^1 0dt=0$, so $f(x_1)-f(x_2)=0 \implies f(x_1)=f(x_2)$. From here I don't know what else I can do. I mean, all that I know is that if I have $x_1,x_2 \in A$ such that $\overline {x_1,x_2}$ is in $A$, then the function takes the same value on $x_1$ and $x_2$. Here's what I could do with Eldredge's idea: Let $x_0 \in A$ and let $U$ be the set of all points in $A$ that can be joined to $x_0$ by a finite number of line segments all contained in $A$. Then, it's easy to see that $f$ is constant in $U$: take $u,z \in U$, we know there are $l_1,...,l_n$ line segments that join $x_0$ with $y$. The extreme points of $l_1$ are $x_0$ and $y_1$, and $l_1$ is a line segment contained in $A$, then $f(x_0)=f(y_1)$. By the same argument, $f(y_i)=f(y_{i+1})$ where $y_i$ and $y_{i+1}$ are the extreme points of the line segment $l_i$ for $2\leq i \leq n-1$ and with $y_n=y$. By induction one can prove $f(x_0)=f(y)$. Using the same argument, $f(x_0)=f(z) \implies f(y)=f(z)$. Now I want to show that $U$ is an open set. Let $x \in U$, as $A$ is open, there exists $\delta>0$ such that $B(x,\delta) \subset A$. If $y \in B(x,\delta)$, then the line segment $\phi$ which joins $x$ with $y$ is also in $A$. Then, the polygon obtained from the composition of $\phi$ with the polygon that joins $x_0$ with $x$ is also contained in $A$ and it joins $x_0$ with $y$, this means $y \in U$, so $B(x,\delta) \subset U \implies U$ is open. Let's prove that $U$ is a closed set in $A$. Take $u$ a limit point of $U$. There exists a sequence $\{u_n\}_{n \in \mathbb N}$ such that $u_n \to u$. As $A$ is open, there is $\epsilon>0$ such that $B(u,\epsilon) \subset A$ and as $u_n \to u$, there is $N \in \mathbb N$ such that for all $n: N \leq n$, $u_n \in B(u,\epsilon)$. We know there is a polygon $A$ which joins $x_0$ with $u_N$ that is completely contained in $A$ and the segment that joins $u$ with $u_N$ is also in $A$, then $u \in U$. So, we have $U \subset A$ which is open and closed, as A is connected, $U=\emptyset$ or $U=A$, but $x_0 \in U \implies U=A$.","['derivatives', 'analysis']"

Since I have no one to consult with, I am posting here. If anyone check my proofs that would be great. I know it is a bit long, my apologies for that. Many thanks for your time in advance! Let $\tau$ be the system of sets consisting of $\emptyset$ and every subset of the the closed unit interval $[0,1]$ obtained by deleting a finite or countable number of points from $X$. Prove that $T=(X, \tau)$ is topological space $T$ satisfies neither the second nor the first axiom of countability Only convergent sequences in $T$ are stationary sequences i.e., the sequences all of whose terms are the same starting from some index $n$ $M=(0,1]$ has the contact point $0$ as a contact point, but contains no sequence of points converging to $0$ So, for (1):
$\emptyset\in\tau$ and if we delete $0$ points (finite) from $[0,1]$ then $X\in\tau$.
Let $\cup_\alpha G_\alpha$ be open sets, then $G_\alpha=X-F_\alpha$ where $F_\alpha$ is at most countable. Then $\cup_\alpha G_\alpha=\cup (X-F_\alpha)=X-\cap_\alpha F_\alpha$, but $\cap\alpha F_\alpha \subset F_\alpha$ is countable (subset of a countable set is countable). Thus arbitrary union of open sets is in topology. I can similarly show ""finite intersection property"". For (2): My idea is if I can show this topology does not satisfy first axiom of countability, then it also fails to satisfy second one (this idea might be wrong, though). Then, if $x\in T$, there is no countable neighbourhood base at $x$ since we have deleted countable points. The problem is I am not sure whether this explanation is true or not, also it does not seem rigorous enough to me. For (3): I don't understand this claim. For any stationary sequence, I can delete them from my system so there would be no stationary sequence in this topology, but then I can create uncountably many stationary sequence (choose any $x\in T$ as members of the sequence). So a bit confusing, but it is clear that a stationary sequence is convergent. That is, any neighbourhood $G$ of $x$ contains every point after certain index. For contradiction, take any non-stationary sequence $\left\{x_n\right\}\to x$. Take neighbourhood $G$ of $x$ such that after certain index, say $N$, every member of $\left\{x_n\right\}$ deleted, except for $x_n=x$. Than $G$ does not contain any member of $\left\{x_n\right\}$, except $x$. For (4): Suppose $G$ is neighbourhood of $0$ such that $G\cap M=\emptyset$. Then $G=\left\{0\right\}$ which cannot be an open set in this topology $T$. By using ii), if $x_n\to 0$ then, it should be stationary i.e., $x_n=0$ for $n>N$, which is impossible.","['general-topology', 'proof-verification']"

562509,"Given $A, B\in R^{n\times n}$ diagonal matrices, there exist $p,q \in R[x]$ and $X\in R^{n\times n}$ such that $A = p(X),B=q(X)$","(1) We are given $A,B \in R^{n\times n}$ diagonal matrices of n rows and n columns with real values. Show that there are $X \in R^{n\times n}$ and polynomials $q$ and $p$ such that: $$q(X)=B \text{ and }p(X)=A$$ What I've tried doing: I've tried a different combinations of X and p,q, for example: If we say that $X=A$ and we define $q(X) = X-A+B$ and $p(X)=X$ we indeed solve the problem
BUT those p and q are not polynomials, because if i use a scalar as an input for those polynomials instead of a matrix, it doesn't work. There is no scalar version of the matrix A (Unlike for example the unit matrix, which the scalar version of which is 1) So that isn't the way to solve the question (2) Is this correct for any 2 matrices or just for diagonal matrices? Hint: What basic difference is there between the polynomial ring and the matrix ring? (Haven't started working on this yet cause didn't solve question 1, but it probably involves that the matrix multiplication isnt commutative)","['matrices', 'polynomials']"
562531,Generic Points to the Italians,"When I first learned algebraic geometry, I naturally wiki-ed the subject and there was a line there that said the old school Italians used the notion ""generic points without any precise definition."" Now that I know what a generic point is, I am curious as to how did the Italians think about a generic point and/or what their intuition about it was and what kind of results did they prove using this notion .

562566,Are there sometimes only finitely many square roots of a positive matrix?,"Question: A positive (semi-) definite matrix has a unique positive (semi-) definite square root. What are its other square roots? In some cases there are infinitely many (such as for $aI$). Are there cases where there are finitely many? In [this][1] question it is shown that the identity matrix has infinitely many square roots (although of course it has a unique positive square root). But it doesn't seem to address the general question of the square roots of a positive operator. The behavior of the class of matrices $$\left( \begin{matrix} \sqrt{a} & t \\ 0 & -\sqrt{a} \end{matrix} \right)$$ as square roots of $aI$ seems to be due to the ""merging"" of the $-\sqrt{a}$ and $\sqrt{a}$ eigenspaces when you square. This might suggest that for a positive matrix with distinct eigenvalues, there are only $2^r$ square roots, with $r$ the rank of the matrix? Ideas: One thing that might narrow it down: if a matrix is normal, will all its square roots be normal, or not necessarily? If we know this, we can go straight to working with eigenvalues.

562591,Eigenbundle decomposition,"Let $G$ be a finite cyclic group and $X$ a smooth manifold equipped with a trivial $G$-action. It is known that we can decompose every $G$-equivariant vector bundle with respect to the action: Every smooth $G$-equivariant vector bundle $V \to X$ can be decomposed as the Whitney sum $V=\bigoplus_{\chi}V_\chi$ of $G$-equivariant vector bundles. Here $\chi$ runs the character group $X(G):=\mathrm{Hom}(G,\mathbb C^\ast)$ and the $G$-action on $V_\chi$ is given by $g \cdot v = \chi(g)v$ ($g \in G$, $v \in V_\chi$). I understand the case when $X$ is a point. This is just the eigenspace decomposition. Question: Why do the eigenspaces vary smoothly so that $V_\chi$ gives a smooth subbundle of $V$? Notes: I do not mention above whether the vector bundle is real or complex. Maybe we should assume it to be complex.

562616,K Nearest Neighbor Density Estimation,"An intuitive way to estimate the pdf of a distribution $f$ is described here . Given a set of points you find the distance to the $k$th nearest neighbor for a point $x$ that we want to know the value of $f$ at. This allows us to calculate the volume of the sphere containing $k$ points. Approximating the probability mass within this sphere as $k$/(number of points in set), we can estimate $\hat{f}(x)$ as the probability mass over the volume. This is fine, but there is a problem in more than dimension when the variance of the marginals  differs greatly. In this case, the volume of the sphere will depend very heavily on points in the dimension of greatest variance. For example consider distribution $f(X)$ s.t $X \sim N(0,1)$. The estimation above should perform well given we have enough points. However now consider $$g(x,y) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
         f(x) & \mbox{if $y = 0$}\\
        0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right.$$ In this case we will be estimating the 'volume' by a circle, when in reality the distribution $g$ is only 1 dimensional which  ends up giving a very different answer to the estimation of $f$. What is the most common way around this? Maybe perform the $k$ nearest neighbor in 2(+) dimensions and approximate the volume using ellipses?","['statistics', 'probability-distributions']"
562622,The number of cyclic subgroups of order 15 in $\mathbb{Z}_{30} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{20}$,"What is the number of cyclic subgroup of order 15 in $\mathbb{Z}_{30} \oplus  \mathbb{Z}_{20}$? I have counted the number of elements with order 15 in $\mathbb{Z}_{30} \oplus  \mathbb{Z}_{20}$ that is $48$, by counting all possibilities of $(a,b)$ where $a\in\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ , $b \in \mathbb{Z}_{20}$ and  $\def\lcm{\operatorname{lcm}}\lcm(|a|,|b|)=15$. My argument is that for an element that has order $15$, say $(x,y)$, then $\langle(x,y)\rangle  =  \langle(x,y)^2\rangle  =   \langle (x,y)^4\rangle    =  \langle (x,y)^7\rangle  = ...=\langle (x,y)^{14}\rangle$ So there are $8$ different elements with order $15$ such that the generate the same subrgroup. So my answer is that there are $\frac{48}{8}=6$ different cyclic subgroups of order 15,
 am i correct? or maybe there are more simpler ways to solve this problem?","['cyclic-groups', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
