1011639,How to understand/remember Hölder's inequality,"If $p$ and $q$ are nonnegative numbers such that
$\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1$ and if $f \in L^p$ and $g \in L^q$, then $f\cdot g \in L^1$ and
$$\int |fg| \leqslant ||f||_p \cdot ||g||_q$$ I think Hölder's inequality is derived in order to prove Minkowski's inequality, which is a generalization of triangle inequality to $L^p$ norm. But is there any intuitive understanding of Hölder's inequality? It's hard for me to remember it. It seems that it's a generalization of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, trying to compare $L^2$ inner product to norm, but the power of each term is different, which makes it harder to be understood compared with Minkowski inequality.","['inequality', 'real-analysis']"
1011677,Closed form for a zeta series :$\sum^\infty_{k=2}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}\zeta(k)}{(k+2)2^{k+2}}$,"It is not that diffcult to derive
\begin{align}
\sum^\infty_{k=2}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}\zeta(k)}{k2^k}=&-\frac{\gamma}{2}+\ln\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\right)\tag{1}\\
\sum^\infty_{k=2}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}\zeta(k)}{(k+1)2^{k+1}}=&-\frac{4+\gamma}{8}+\ln\left(A^{3/2}2^{5/24}\right)\tag{2}
\end{align}
Hence, I would like to know if there exists a closed form in terms of known mathematical constants for the following series
$$\mathscr{S}=\sum^\infty_{k=2}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}\zeta(k)}{(k+2)2^{k+2}}$$
As $(1)$ and $(2)$ follow immediately from the definitions of $\Gamma(z)$ and $G(z+1)$ respectively, my guess is that the evaluation of $\mathscr{S}$ involves the function $\Gamma_3(z)$. Unfortunately, I know almost nothing about higher order multiple gamma functions, and I would really appreciate it if someone can enlighten me on this matter and provide a viable solution to the series above. Thank you. This is what I have managed to get so far.
Begin with the sum
\begin{align}
\sum^\infty_{k=2}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}\zeta(k)}{k+1}z^{k+1}
=&\sum^\infty_{k=3}\sum^\infty_{m=1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k}\frac{z^{k}}{m^{k-1}}\\
=&\sum^\infty_{m=1}\left\{-m\ln\left(1+\frac{z}{m}\right)-\frac{z^2}{2m}+z\right\}\\
\end{align}
Compare this with $\ln{G(z+1)}$.
$$\ln{G(z+1)}=-\frac{z}{2}+\frac{z}{2}\ln(2\pi)-\frac{z^2}{2}-\frac{\gamma z^2}{2}+\sum^\infty_{m=1}\left\{m\ln\left(1+\frac{z}{m}\right)+\frac{z^2}{2m}-z\right\}$$
It follows that
$$\sum^\infty_{k=1}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}\zeta(k)}{k+1}z^{k+1}=-\frac{z}{2}+\frac{z}{2}\ln(2\pi)-\frac{z^2}{2}-\frac{\gamma z^2}{2}-\ln{G(z+1)}$$
Integrate from $0$ to $z$ to get
\begin{align}
&-\frac{z^2}{2}+\frac{z^2}{2}\ln(2\pi)-\frac{z^3}{2}-\frac{\gamma z^3}{2}-z\ln{G(z+1)}-\sum^\infty_{k=1}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}\zeta(k)}{(k+2)}z^{k+2}\\
=&\sum^\infty_{k=1}\left\{-k(k+z)\ln\left(\frac{k+z}{k}\right)+kz+\frac{z^2}{2}-\frac{z^3}{6k}\right\}
\end{align}
After letting $z=\frac12$, I have no idea how to proceed further as when I take the exponential of the partial sum, the portion with the $\ln$ term doesn't seem to telescope.","['special-functions', 'infinite-product', 'sequences-and-series', 'integration', 'gamma-function']"

1011715,Real Analysis : Self Studying vs Doing a Course,"I am an engineering graduate student. Recently I got interested in studying Maths. So, I have started self-studying Real Analysis(let's call it RA) using a few books. I will also be using problem books to supplement my learning. I told my adviser that I'd be devoting a certain amount of time in studying Maths, apart from the time that I devote to my engineering thesis. He told me that self-studying RA would not be a good option. RA is something which requires the discipline of a coursework. You might get some feel of it but the rigorousness can only be achieved through a course. He said that pure mathematics is not something like programming in which you can become master by self-studying. I did not debate him on this. But I wanted to ask you this: If I am extremely dedicated to studying RA, devoting 4-5 hours daily and doing problems given in the textbook or a separate problem book, trying to understand every theorem/concept which the author says is important, and honestly attempting problems, will I be able to understand Real Analysis in the same manner as doing a course. My target is to learn RA up to the level of an Undergraduate Mathematics Major. Your answer should answer some or all of the following questions: Is it possible at all to achieve the same level of understanding through self-studying as compared to a course? What is the essential difference (the ""gist"") between self-studying and doing a coursework in RA? How much more time should it take in self-studying, comparatively? Can honestly attempting problems in the books be an alternative to exams and assignments? PS: I'm in my masters right now but will be going for PhD which will also be in Engineering. However, during PhD also I'm thinking of honing my Maths skills and might go for a separate major later on if I so desire. So, essentially I am hell-bent in understanding Mathematics which has intimidated me for so long. And as it is turning out, I am actually enjoying it thoroughly!!

1011835,frustrating experience about differential geometry,"I am felling rather frustrated now, after taking a long time to study differential geometry, but with little progress... Indeed my major is mainly numerical analysis. I am studying modern geometry, because I am interested in some points of geometric mechanics, like in Arnold and Jerry Marsden's beautiful books. And on the other hand, I am preparing for some researches related to some ""geometric"" topics, like general relativity. I began to study differential manifold etc. from undergraduate, mostly by myself. I began by S.S.Chern's book. I thought it was a mistake, because that book is very formal. Indeed I read that for several times, but when I close the book, I did not know what I have read... Now the situation gets better, but still difficult... I try to drive the formulations by myself, try to write them down. But the progress is still quite slow. When I deal with PDEs, I can see clearly the essential points in estimates. But when I turn to  Riemannian geometry, Lie groups etc., I get lost in the confusing notions, and have no idea to start MY OWN proof.

1011884,Is the greatest common divisor injective? Is it bijective?,"In an examination paper, there were the following questions: Is gcd an injective function? Is gcd a bijective function? I found these questions odd because I thought that we need to first know the domain and codomain of a function before we can decide whether it is injective or bijective. The question did not specify what was the domain and codomain. Since every integer divides 0 (except 0 itself), then gcd(0, 0) would be undefined as there is no ""greatest"" integer that divides 0 and 0. Hence, it seems reasonable to exclude 0 from the domain. Also, since 0 does not divide any number, it is impossible for 0 to be the gcd of any two integers a and b, so 0 should be excluded from the codomain. Now, suppose we let both the domain and codomain be the set of all positive natural numbers. Would this domain be valid? I am confused because the gcd function contains two arguments, i.e. a and b in gcd(a, b). Since this is the case, should the domain instead be the cartesian product N*N? Clearly gcd is a function because it is not one-to-many. Every time we perform gcd we get exactly one output. Is it correct to claim that gcd is not an injective function because it maps two natural numbers a and b to a single output c, i.e. gcd(a, b) = c, hence it is many-to-one? Or should the correct reason be that gcd is not injective because more than one pair of numbers can have the same gcd, hence there is no strict one-one correspondence between the domain and the codomain? For example, gcd(2, 4) = 2 and gcd(2, 8) = 2. Also, is it correct to claim that gcd is a surjective function because every element in the codomain is the gcd of a pair of positive natural numbers, i.e. every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain? I came to this conclusion because every positive natural number k can be expressed as k = gcd(k, k).

1011961,Dual Radon transform: different conventions?,"I am having a hard time trying to understand apparently two different definitions of the dual Radon Transform. I am reading simultaneously the book ""Mathematics of computerized tomography"", by Frank Natterer, and ""Radon transform on homogeneous spaces"", by Sigurdur Helgason (by now, only the first chapter of each book). I will try to be thorough in the exposition of my doubt(s). To this end, let me explain a little bit the treatment of this subject in each author, to save you from the trouble of having to look at the books mentioned. (Note: in the sequel, $\omega_{n}$ is the surface area of the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^{n},$ $\mathcal{P}$ is the set of all hyperplanes, $R(f)(\pi)=\int_{\pi}f(y)dm(y)$ is the Radon transform, $R(f)(\theta,s)=\int_{\{ \langle x,\theta \rangle =0 \}}f(x+s\theta)dm(x),$ is also the Radon transform, seen as a symmetric function over the cylinder ) Let me start with Natterer. He defines the dual Radon transform as follows:  first, a continuous function $g(\pi)$ in the set of hyperplanes can be identified with a symmetric continuous function in $S^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R}$ of the form $g(\theta, s),$ where $\theta$ is the normal vector to the hyperplane and $s$ is the distance from the plane to the origin.  Then Natterer defines the dual Radon transform as: $ R^{\#}(g)(x):=\displaystyle \int _{S^{n-1}} g(\theta ,\langle x,\theta \rangle ) dS(\theta).$
He strongly motivates this definition, so I take it is not a misprint. Is with this definition that he derives an important formula (in particular, to derive the inversion theorem):
$$R^{\#}R(f)(x)=\omega_{n-1}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} \vert x-y \vert ^{-1}f(y) dy.$$ Now, let me very briefly explain what Helgason does: The dual transform is now defined as $R^{\#}(g)(x)=\displaystyle \int_{\{ \pi \in \mathcal{P} \hspace{1mm}:\hspace{1mm} x \in \pi \} }g(\pi) d\mu,$ where $\mu$ is the unique normalized measure invariant under rotations. Helgason readily says that this must be $\displaystyle c\int_{S^{n-1}} g(\theta,\langle x,\theta \rangle) dS(\theta)$ for certain constant $c,$ which seems very logical but I don't seem to be able to prove rigorously . Of course, for Natterer $c=1,$ but the point is that this is not so for Helgason.  For Helgason, is trivial that his definition implies that $R^{\#}(g)(x)=\displaystyle \int_{O(n)} g(x+k \pi_{0}) dk,$ where $dk$ is the Haar measure on the orthogonal group and $\pi_{0}$ is any fixed hyperplane containing the origin (so, another doubt , how do we prove this?). Now, an argument based upon the uniqueness of normalized rotationally invariant measures shows that $c=\frac{1}{\omega_{n}}.$ Due to this, Helgason derives the formula:
$$R^{\#}R(f)(x)=\frac{\omega_{n-1}}{\omega_{n}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} \vert x-y \vert ^{-1}f(y) dy.$$ My feeling is that Helgason's point of view is more correct, but I cannot completely grasp his arguments, and he seems a little thick in his exposition at some points. I am worried, because I do not know what's going on with Natterer's book. So, to sum up, I want to clarify: 1º: The arguments used by Helgason, which I have marked as doubts. 2º: The convention used by Natterer, which seems less logical than Helgason's. Also, I'd like to find out which convention or criterion is more widely employed. As a last point, if you have any suggestions about other books which I could use in my study of the Radon Transform, I will appreciate them! Thank you. EDIT:  From a quick overview of several lecture notes available online, I take that Natterer's convention is pretty common. This seems weird to me, for that convention is incompatible with the natural definition of Helgason $R^{\#}(g)(x)=\displaystyle \int_{\{ \pi \in \mathcal{P} \hspace{1mm}:\hspace{1mm} x \in \pi \} }g(\pi) d\mu.$",['analysis']

1012088,Confusion about the definition of self adjoint and formally self-adjoint,"I have some confusion about the definition of self-adjoint operators and formally self-adjoint operators. Let me write down the background information. Let $H$ be a infinite dimensional complex Hilbert space and $T:D(T)\to H$ a (not necessarily bounded) linear operator , where $D(T)$ is dense in $H$. The operator $T$ is said to be formally self-adjoint if for all $x, y\in D(T)$, we have $\langle Tx, y\rangle=\langle x, Ty\rangle.$ The operator $T$ is said to be self-adjoint if $T^*=T$, where $T^*$ is the adjoint of $T$. Of course if $D(T)=H$ and $T$ is formally self-adjoint in the above sense, then $T$ must be bounded and therefore $T$ is also self adjoint. Let $M$ be a closed Riemannian manifold and $P:C^\infty(M)\to C^\infty(M)$ an elliptic pseudodifferential operator. We know $C^\infty(M)$ is dense in $L^2(M)$ (and even in $H_s(M)$).

Suppose $P$ is formally self-adjoint, i.e., for all $f, g\in C^\infty(M)$, we have $\langle Pf, g\rangle_{L^2(M)}=\langle f, Pg\rangle_{L^2(M)}.$ We also know that the extension of $P$ to $P:H_s(M)\to H_{s-d}(M)$ is a bounded linear operator (indeed it's Fredholm). Well, then I don't know how to continue my question, perhaps I am really confused by my confusion. Anyway, I would appreciate if someone can clear my confusion for which I couldn't even explain.

1012089,Linear ODE with periodic coefficient,"Let $ f$ be a periodic function of period $T$ and $\phi $ an solution of the linear equation $$y'-f(x)y =0$$ Prove that if $ \phi(x)$ is a solution, then $\phi(x+T) $ is also a solution. More than this, prove that there exists a constant $c$ such that $$\phi(x+T) = c \phi(x)$$ My attempt Solving the linear ode, we have that
$$y=k \exp(\int - f(x) dx)$$ If $\phi$ is a solution, then $\phi(x) =k \exp(\int - f(x) dx)$ I  dont know how to rigorously proceed from here: We know that 
f(x)=f(x+T) 
since the function is periodic. So, is it sufficient to substitute f(x+T) for f(x) when calculating \phi(x+T)? I am not sure how I should work with periodic functions and indefinitive integrals.

1012104,Classification of operators,"I have a collection of questions about the limit point/circle concept and self-adjointness that are kind of connected, so I would like to ask them in a row. Apparently, an operator that is limit point/ limit circle has either deficiency indices one or two. This means for me that in Sturm-Liouville theory we do not want to study self-adjoint operators that would always have deficiency indices zero, but only these minimal operators, but I don't quite see why? 1.) I found the following definition: A minimal operator is a densely-defined, closed and symmetric operator (i.e. $T \subset T^{**} \subset T^*$). Thus, this operator cannot be unique, right? Especially, a self-adjoint extension (if one exists) of this operator would also be a minimal operator by this definition? Does this mean that the maximal operator is just the adjoint of the minimal operator (this would mean that the maximal operator is also closed, densely defined and an extension of the minimal operator)? 2.) Apparently for 2nd order Sturm-Liouville operators, it is said that there is this l.c. /l.p. dichotomy (so an operator is either l.p. or l.c.), but the self-adjoint extension would be neither l.c. or l.p. as the deficiency indices are clearly zero. This somehow contradicts the dichotomy in that way. I think there I am probably wrong about the definitions, so maybe anybody could help me with that? 3.) If we take a domain for a Sturm-Liouville operator in the l.c. case for example, then we have to impose boundary conditions sometimes in order to exclude unwanted solutions ( as we do for Legendre's differential equation). Now, if we study its self-adjoint extension ( which has a larger domain(!)), then I don't see how we could a priori know that this extension has not reintroduced the solutions that we tried to exclude or can this never happen? 4.) If we know that a Sturm-Liouville operator on a finite interval is l.p. and we know that the spectrum is purely discrete, does this always mean that there is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors that span $L^2$? ( I mean I know that it is true for l.c. operators in general and we know in the l.c. case a priori that the spectrum is discrete, but can we conclude the existence of an ONB in the l.p. case, if we know that all elements in the spectrum must be discrete)?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'operator-theory', 'real-analysis', 'analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

My task is explicitly to model this such that I can use Chernoff bounds. 
Chernoff bounds, in the context we had it, can be applied if we have a sum $X:=\sum_{i=1}^m X_i$ of independent indicator random variables $X_i \sim Be(p_i)$. My problem is that clearly the different $3 \times 3$ grids are not independent, so the easy approach to state $X=\sum_{s \in S} X_s$ where $S$ is the set of all $3\times 3$ subgrids and $X_s$ is $1$ if $s$ is a monochromatic grid, and calculate $P[X=0]$ does not work.

I know that by the Cramer-Wold theorem, for rotationally invariant random variables if we have a linear functional $t$ then $t'X$ has the same distribution as $|t|U$. Also $U$ and $W$ are rotationally invariant each in its own right in this case. I think these two assumptions should be used somewhere in the proof I just don't know how to start, because to me this is basically saying that the joint distribution of $(X, Y)$ is completely determined by the distribution of their first coordinate which is similar to Cramer-Wold except that the factor $|t|$ here is one so somehow ""length"" of $A'$ should be $1$ or it should appear as $A'A$ which is the identity.

Consider the following decoding method: At first a combination is chosen randomly and uniformly. At the next trial a digit from this combination is chosen uniformly at random and its entry is substituted by a uniformly randomly chosen element from $\left\{A,...,Z,0,...,9\right\}$. This procedure is repeated until the password is found. (a) What is the probability that the correct password will never be entered? (b) What is the probability that eventually the same combination will be entered two consecutive times? I already asked how to get the anwers to (a) and (b) without using the here mentioned special decoding method and I got great help, see Probability concerning a 6-digit password . Now I have to answer (a) and (b) using the decoding method and again I have enormous problems! Combinatorical thoughts are not my favourite business. Nevertheless I tried to find the probabilities in an analog way as it was shown to me in the linked thread. Additionally, I wonder if this task now maybe has something to do with Markov chains because the lecture this task is from is about Markov chains. I think there are (at least) the two following ways to understand the described decoding strategy, which sense is meant? Sense 1 We choose (randomly and uniformly) one of the $36^6$ possible combinations. If it is the right, we stop. Otherwise we then choose (randomly and uniformly) one of the 6 digits and substitute it (randomly and uniformly) by a symbol out of the alphabet. Then we choose (randomly and uniformly) one of the remaining 5 digits and subtitute it and so on until we substituted all the 6 digits. If this was the right password, we stop. If not, we again start substituting the 6 digits (the digits of the combination that we chosed at the beginning, that is, we stick to this combination). Sense 2 Same as above with the difference that after we substituted all 6 digits and saw that it is the wrong password, we choose (randomly and uniformly) another combination out of the $36^6$ possibilities (it can be the same as before) and then substitute the digits of this new combination. I think that sense 1 is meant and thus I considered the task in this sense. (a) Anyway, my result here is $0$, because as far as I see the probability not to have reached the right password after n passages is
$$
\left(1-\frac{1}{36^6}\right)\cdot\left(1-\prod_{k=1}^6\frac{1}{k\cdot 36}\right)^n
$$
and this tends to $0$ as $n\to\infty$. Remark : If we decode without this special method (see the linked thread) then the probability of (a) is 0, too. (b) The probability that we have eventually one pair of consecutive equal guesses is - to my results - 
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(1-\frac{1}{36^6}\right)\cdot\left(\prod_{k=1}^6\frac{35}{k\cdot 36}\right)\cdot\left(\prod_{k=1}^6\frac{34}{k\cdot 36}\right)^n\left(\prod_{k=1}^6\frac{1}{k\cdot 36}\right)
$$ Edit I think my last result for (b) was not correct, I think instead it has to be

1012631,Hodge Bundles on Tropical Spaces,"I am not sure that this question even makes sense, which I suppose is part of the questions itself. In any case, I attended a talk recently wherin there was some discussion about a ""tropical Teichmuller space"", as for example in this paper, associated to the tropical moduli space of abelian varieties. My understanding is that the moduli space of tropical abelian varieties $A_g^{trop}$ can be identified with the skeleton of a Berkovich analytic space associated to the moduli space of abelian varieties $A_g$. Does the Hodge Bundle on the moduli space of abelian varieties ""carry over"" (whatever that should mean) to the analytic space? If so, can you then ""pull it back"" to the skeleton, onto which the analytic space deformation retracts? My question is motivated by the fact that the speaker suggested that this ""tropical Teichmuller space"" gives some tropical analogy to the Siegel upper half space model for $A_g$, where you take a quotient by $GL_n$ to get the moduli space of tropical abelian varieties. I am basically wondering if there is some notion of a ""tropical Siegel modular form"", which arises as a section of a ""tropical Hodge bundle"". Some nice references for tropical geometry and Berkovich analytic spaces is also welcome.","['algebraic-geometry', 'modular-forms', 'tropical-geometry']"

1012656,Period of a mechanical system,"Im trying to solve the following problem. Consider $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with coordinates $(x,y)$. Let $H$ be a smooth function on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Also, consider the Hamilton equations: $$\dfrac{dx}{dt}=\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial y}, \qquad \dfrac{dy}{dt}=-\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial x}.$$ The Liouville $1-$form is $\Theta=y\,dx$. If $(x,y)$ lies on an integral curve $\Gamma^{+}$, we call the action to be the number $$I(x,y)=\int_{\Gamma^{+}}\Theta.$$ $1.$ What is the relation between the action and the area of the region inside $\Gamma$? $2.$ Is possible to express the period of $\Gamma$ as a line integral over $\Gamma$? Such integral is always improper? For the first part I used Stokes' theorem as follows: If $\Sigma$ is the region on the phase plane, whose boundary is $\Gamma$, and $\Sigma$ is oriented in such way that the induced orientation on $\Gamma$ is positive, we have $$I(x,y)=\int_{\Gamma^{+}}\Theta=\int_{\partial \Sigma^{+}}y\,dx=\int_{\Sigma^{+}}d(y\,dx)=\int_{\Sigma^{+}}dy\wedge dx=-\int_{\Sigma^{+}}dx\wedge dy=-\text{area}(\Sigma).$$ For the second part, we know from Hamilton equations that $dt=\left(\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial y}\right)^{-1}dx$. Now, let E be a value of Energy and $\Gamma$ a curve of level $E$ on the phase plane. Then the period $T$ of $\Gamma$ is: $$T=\int_{\Gamma^{+}}dt=\int_{\Gamma^{+}}\left(\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial y}\right)^{-1}dx.$$ Of course, the last integral is always improper, because that $1-$form is not defined on the whole plane, just on an open subset not containing any periodic orbit. I would like to know if there is another $1-$ form defined on the whole plane, whose integral is the period. I have the next idea but I'm not sure. For a curve $\Gamma$ of level $E$, define $\tau=\dfrac{dI}{E}$. So, $$T=\int_{\Gamma^{+}}\tau.$$ This is suggested by a problem in Arnold's book, Mathtematical Methods of Classical Mechanics , where a problem is to show that $T=\dfrac{dI}{dE}$.

1012678,Bernoulli event expansion in 0 to 3 occurrences cancel to first order,"I am working through Hamming's The Art of Probability and am having trouble with a problem in the Bernouilli Trials section. The wording is the following Expand the binomials in the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, and 3 occurrences, and show that the expansions cancel out to the next term provided $np \lt 1$. Hence if $np \ll 1$, the first term neglected in the expansion is close to the exact result for 4 or more events. I am assuming that the solution should give something like $\sum_{k = 0}^{3}B(k; n, p) = np + \mathcal{O}\left [(np)^4 \right ]$ but I can't actually get anything that cancels to the first order. Using the recursion relation of Bernouilli trials, $B(k+1; n, p) = \frac{n - k}{k+1}\frac{p}{q}B(k; n,p)$, I get $$(1 - p)^n \left (1 + \frac{np}{q} + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\frac{p^2}{q^2} + \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}\frac{p^3}{q^3} \right)$$ Expanding this and keeping the terms 0th and first order in $np$ yields $$(1-p)^n \left (1 - \frac{1}{6}\frac{6 p^3 -29 p^2 + 33 p - 12}{(1-p)^3} + \mathcal{O}\left [(np)^2 \right ]\right )$$ Am I misunderstanding the question? I expected the second term to cancel. Edit: I guess one could use the expansion for $\exp (-np) \approx \left ((1-p)^{\frac{1}{p}} \right )^{-np}$ and then expand it in a Taylor series, $\exp (-np) = 1 - np + \frac{(np)^2}{2} - \frac{(np)^3}{6} + \mathcal{O}\left [(np)^4\right ]$. This matches the terms of the form $(np)^k$ and they do have the opposite signs, but I don't quite understand why you can get away with ignoring the $q$ in the denominator. That is, $$\begin{eqnarray}
& \exp (-np) + \frac{np}{q} + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\frac{p^2}{q^2} + \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}\frac{p^3}{q^3} \\

(Proof Verification) Proof: Let G be generated by c, b, where $c^2 = b^2 = 1$. Let $a = cb$ be an element of order, say n. The element a is of finite order since G is finite. G is clearly generated by a, b since $c = cbb = ab$ is generated by a, b. Note that $a^{-1} = bc$ since $bca = bccb = 1$. Therefore $bab = bcbb = bc = a^{-1}$. Let $\alpha$ be the rotation of $2\pi/n$ degree and $\beta$ the reflection along the line formed by $v_0$ and the origin in $D_{2n}$. Let $f: G \to D_{2n}$ be defined by $f(a^kb^l) = \alpha^k\beta^l$ for $0 \leq k \leq n$ and $0 \leq l \leq 1$. It is clear that $f$ is homomorphic and injective. Now, we need to prove that $f$ is surjective. It is sufficient to show that f is surjective by showing that G has $2n$ elements since $f$ is injective. The group G contains 2 subgroups $H_1 = <a>$ and $H_2 = <b>$ of order n and 2, respectively. If we can show that $H_1 \cap H_2 = 1$, then G must contain $2n$ elements. Clearly $b \notin H_1$ . If $a^i = b$, for $1 \leq i \leq n - 1$  then $a^{i-1} = a^ibc = bbc = c$, which is a contradiction to the fact that a is of order n. We also know that $a \neq b$, else c will be the identity, which is a contradiction. This implies that $a^i \notin H_2$ Hence, the result.","['proof-verification', 'abstract-algebra']"

(That is, do there exist two representations $\phi:A\otimes_{\max} B\rightarrow A\otimes_{min}B$ and $\psi: A\otimes_{\min} B\rightarrow M_{n}(\mathbb{C})$ such that $\pi=\psi\circ\phi$.)","['c-star-algebras', 'operator-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"
1013122,A problem on distributing 29 disks on $7\times 7$ grid,"I got this problem: Given a $7\times 7$ grid, if we distribute $29$ disks on the grid such that each square cannot hold more than $1$ disk, what is the probability that there will be at least one row full of disks on the grid? My first try: $P(\{\text{there is at least one row full of disks}\}= \frac{7\times{42\choose 22}}{49\choose 29}$ Since we have $7$ ways to choose the row that we will fill by disks, and then we have remaining $22$ disks which we will distribute over the remaining $42$ squares. But this is obviously wrong since we count some combinations multiple times. My second try: $P(\{ \text{there is at least one row full of disks}\}= P(\{\text{there is exactly 1 row full of disks}\}\cup\{\text{there is exactly 2 rows full of disks}\}\cup\{\text{there is exactly 3 rows full of disks}\}\cup\{\text{there is exactly 4 rows full of disks}\})=P(\{\text{there is exactly 1 row full of disks}\}+P(\{\text{there is exactly 2 rows full of disks}\}+P(\{\text{there is exactly 3 rows full of disks}\}+P(\{\text{there is exactly 4 rows full of disks}\}$ But this probably makes things harder and does not simplifies things. My third try: $P(\{\text{there is at least one row full of disks}\}= 1-P(\{\text{there are no rows full of disks}\})$ But I got stuck, I tried to count the number of combinations in which each row got an empty square but here too I counted some combinations multiple times. Any hint/help will be appreciated.","['probability', 'combinatorics']"
