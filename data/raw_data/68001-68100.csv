815803,How to extend an existing orthogonal set of vectors?,"Suppose I have $k$ vectors in $\mathbb R^n$ that are orthogonal to each other ($k \ll n$). Is there an efficient way to find another vector that is orthogonal to all these given vectors? If we put the $k$ vectors in a $k \times n$ matrix, denoted by $A$, then the problem is identical to finding a vector in the null space of $A$. Of course one can resort to the method of solving an underdetermined linear system to find the null space of $A$, but by doing this we have got all the vectors that span the null space of $A$. For $k \ll n$, this is definitely not efficient, since I only need one vector in the null space. I'm wondering if there exists a smarter way.","['linear-algebra', 'algorithms']"
815826,Prove $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\Gamma(n+1/2)}{\Gamma(n)~n^{1/2}}=1$,"Prove $$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\Gamma(x+1/2)}{\Gamma(x)~x^{1/2}}=1.$$ I got this problem from Probability and Statistics by Degroot & Schervish. There is a hint to use Stirling's formula which is stated as: $$\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{(2\pi)^\frac{1}{2}x^{x-1/2}e^{-x}}{\Gamma(x)}=1.$$ One way is to reduce the problem by using the hint to $$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\Gamma(x+1/2)~e^x}{(2\pi)^\frac{1}{2}x^{x}}=1.$$ But that did not helped me much. I though about doing the following, but I'm not sure that it is correct: $$\begin{align}\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\Gamma(x+1/2)}{\Gamma(x)~x^{1/2}}&= \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\int_o^\infty u^{x-1/2}e^{-u}du}{\int_o^\infty u^{x-1}e^{-u}x^{1/2}du}\\
&=\lim_{x \to \infty} \left(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\int_o^k u^{x-1/2}e^{-u}du}{\int_o^k u^{x-1}e^{-u}x^{1/2}du} \right)\\
&= \lim_{x \to \infty} \left(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{k^{x-1/2}e^{-k}}{k^{x-1}e^{-k}x^{1/2}} \right) \\
&=\lim_{x \to \infty} \left(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{k^{1/2}}{x^{1/2}} \right) \\
&=1.\end{align}$$ I basically tried to apply L'hopital's rule and to play with double limits but I'm really not sure whether this is so to speak 'permissible'. Thus, I would be grateful for any comments or corrections. Please note: the book is relatively at an introductory level so elementary methods should suffice.

815859,Is it compulsory to make transformation to the econometric model in order to have only diagonal elements on variance-covariance matrix of errors?,"I need some sharped and advanced advices for the following issue ... Model and its assumptions I'm working on the methodology of a two-way error component model.
Here is the model: $y_{jis} = x_{jis} \beta + \upsilon_{jis}$.
$j$ refers to school, $i$ refers to individual and $s$ to tested area/topic (mathematics or english, ...). $J$ is the number of schools and $S$ is the number of tested fields. $N$ is the number of students among all schools. $\upsilon_{jis}$ is the error term and can be decomposed as follows: $\upsilon_{jis} = \theta_{j} + \phi_{js} + \epsilon_{jis}$ $\theta_{j}$ is the random effect for students attenting a school $j$, $\phi_{js}$ is the random effect for students attenting a school $j$ for a topic $s$ and $\epsilon_{jis}$ is the traditionnal idiosyncratic error. In multivariate form it gives: $$Y = X \beta + \upsilon$$ 
where $\upsilon = R \theta + F \phi + \epsilon $ $R$ and $F$ are matrices that enable to correclty distribute their respective random effect.
R: size $= NS \times J$.   F: size $= NS \times JS$ $\theta$ follows a multivariate normal with mean $0$ and a variance covariance matrix $= \tau I_{J}$. $\tau$ is a scalar and $I_{J}$ is the identity matrix (size: $J \times J$). $\phi$ follows a multivariate normal with mean $0$ and a variance covariance matrix $= \gamma I_{JS}$. $\gamma$ is a scalar and $I_{JS}$ is the identity matrix (size: $J S \times J S$). $\epsilon$ follows a multivariate normal with mean $0$ and a variance covariance matrix $= \sigma I_{NS}$. $\sigma$ is a scalar and $I_{JS}$ is the identity matrix (size: $N S \times N S$). Estimation of unknown parameters I have to make estimation of the different variances: $\tau$, $\gamma$ and $\sigma$ before running FGLS method. 
I work step by step to delete the different random effect. First I made a within regression to get rid of $\phi$ effect. Since $\phi$ is an effect for a given school, that within operator ($W$) will automatically make the $\theta$ effect vanishing. $\epsilon$ is the only survivor and I can use the methodology in Hayashi to calculate the expectation of $( (We)' We | X) = . ..$ in order to correct with the right degree of freedom. It is easy since the variance of that element is only diagonal, it will then lead to calculate the trace .... Now, I only want to make the term theta disappear with another within operator ($W_{2}$). By construction, it deletes $\theta$, so there are $\phi$ and $\epsilon$ left. Once again I try to perform the expectation of $ ( (W_{2}e)' W_{2}e | X)$ where $e$ is composed now of $\phi$ and $\epsilon$. The variance of that vector is not diagonal, thus we don't have a beautiful formula for the estimated variance of $\phi$ ... I carefully follow the good methodology but I don't have a good-looking formula. Is it compulsory to make transformation to the model in order to have only diagonal elements on variance-covariance matrix of errors? I can also provide more details about the development of Hayashi that I reuse ... Thanks in advance.","['statistics', 'regression', 'estimation', 'mathematical-modeling']"

815948,Radius of Convergence for a Complex Function,"I'm really rusty on my series convergence, and I guess I was more asking for a bit of clarification on a question I'm working on. I've been asked to find the power series expansion for $\frac{1}{3 - z}$ about the point $4i$, and to then give the radius of convergence. After a bit of tedium, I got the power series expansion as follows; $$\frac{1}{3 - z} = \frac{1}{3 - 4i - (z - 4i)}$$
$$ = \frac{1}{3-4i} \frac{1}{1 - \frac{z-4i}{3-4i}}$$
$$ = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{3-4i} (\frac{z-4i}{3-4i})^n$$
$$ = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(3-4i)^{n+1}} (z-4i)^n$$ Now, I know this will hold true for $\frac{|z - 4i|}{5} < 1$, which is equivalent to $|z-4i| < 5$, so is it correct to say that the radius of convergence for this function is 5 (ie; the ball of radius 5, centred at 4i)??","['power-series', 'complex-analysis']"

[duplicate]","This question already has an answer here : $b_n$ bounded, $\sum a_n$ converges absolutely, then $\sum a_nb_n$ also (1 answer) Closed 10 years ago . My attempt: Since $(b_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is bounded it follows that there exists a bounded sequence $$(c_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}: 0 \leq |b_n| \leq |c_n|, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$$ Therefore it follows that: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_nb_n \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_nc_n$$ Since $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$ converges absolutely $\Rightarrow$ $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$ converges $\Rightarrow (a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} $ is a null sequence $\Rightarrow \exists N \in \mathbb{N}: \forall n \geq N: |a_n| \lt \frac{\epsilon}{|c|p}$, where $c:= max\{c_1,\dots,c_n,\dots\}, p \in \mathbb{N}$ Then it follows that: $$\forall n \geq N: |a_nc_n|=|a_n||c_n| \lt |a_n||c| \lt \frac{\epsilon}{|c|p}|c|=\frac{\epsilon}{p}$$ $$\Rightarrow \forall n \geq N: |a_{n+1}c_{n+1}+\dots+a_{n+p}c_{n+p}|\leq  |a_{n+1}c_{n+1}|+ \dots +|a_{n+p}c_{n+p}| \lt p\frac{\epsilon}{p}=\epsilon$$ So after Cauchy's convergence test, it follows that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_nc_n$ is a convergent majorant of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_nb_n$ and therefore $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_nb_n$ converges absolutely. Was this proof correct? And a second part of that question is: If $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges, but not absolutely, does $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_nb_n$ converge? For my proof I didn't really needed $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}$ to converge absolutely, I just used the fact that it converges when it converges absolutely and since I proved that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_nb_n$ converges absolutely, it converges as well.

816136,"Is a sigma algebra (up to null sets, as in conditional expectation) always generated by a random variable?","Motivation Let $(\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb P)$ be a standard probability space. For two $\mathcal H, \mathcal G \subset \mathcal F$, we say $\mathcal H = \mathcal G$ mod 0, if they are same up to null sets (i.e. if for each $H \in \mathcal H$, there is a counterpart $G \in \mathcal G$ with $H \Delta G$ being a null set and vice versa.). Let $X$ be a $L^1$ random variable on $\Omega$. Let $\mathcal H$ be a sub-sigma-algebra of $\mathcal F$. Then the conditional expectation of $X$ given $\mathcal H$, denoted by $E(X | \mathcal H)$, is another random variable and is unique up to null sets. I wonder if reasoning about quantities like $E(X | \mathcal H)$ reduces to reasoning about quantities like $E(X | \sigma(Y))$ (where $Y$ is another random variable). Question Is it true that every sub-sigma-algebra $\mathcal H$ (of $\mathcal F$) is (up to null sets) generated by a random variable? In other words, can we always find a random variable $Y$ such that $\sigma(Y) = \mathcal H$ mod 0? Cautions Recall that $(\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb P)$ is assumed to be a standard probability space. This assumption is there to avoid pathological cases. The question does not require that $\sigma(Y)$ and $\mathcal H$ be exactly the same, only that they be the same up to null sets. This weak requirement is because of the motivation, and because of: Is every sigma-algebra generated by some random variable? Some thoughts Counterexamples cannot be formed by taking many random variables: Any $\sigma$-algebra of the form $\sigma(Y_1, Y_2, \cdots)$ can be generated by a single random variable $Y$ because $\mathbb R^{\mathbb N}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb R$ as measurable spaces. The invariant sigma algebra (from the $L^1$ ergodic theorem for non-ergodic measures) cannot be a counterexample: if $f_1, f_2, \cdots$ forms a countable dense subset of the $L^1$ space associated with the system, then their time averages $f_1^*, f_2^*, \cdots$ generate the invariant sigma algebra up to null sets.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'conditional-probability']"

816179,Asymptotic expansion of $\int\limits_0^{\pi / 2} {e^{ix\cos t}}dt$,"Using the method of stationary phase, I was able to obtain the first term of the asymptotic expansion of the following integral, as $x \rightarrow \infty$:
$$\int\limits_0^{\pi / 2} {e^{ix\cos t}}dt \sim \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2x}} e^{i({x-\pi/4})}.$$ However, I'm interested in finding a few more terms of the asymptoptic expansion, so I guess I have to apply the method of steepest descent. This was my reasoning: We have an integral of the form $$\int \limits_0^{\pi/2} e^{x\phi (t)}dt $$
with
$$\tag{1} \phi(t) = i\cos t.$$ We want to find paths for which $\operatorname{Im} \phi(t)$ is constant and determine which directions along these curves cause $\operatorname{Re} \phi(t)$ to decrease. Let’s start by taking $t=x +iy$ on (1) , so we can find the real and imaginary parts of $\phi(t)$; we get: $$\phi(x + iy) = i\cos(x + iy) = \sin x\sinh y + i\cos x\cosh y$$ so $\operatorname{Re} \phi(t) = \sin x\sinh y$ and $\operatorname{Im} \phi(t) = \cos x\cosh y.$ Thus, the paths that make $\operatorname{Im} \phi(t)$ constant constitute the family of curves $$\tag{2} \cos x\cosh y = k, \, k \in \mathbb{R}.$$ There are two curves which belong to family (2) that are useful in the context of this problem, as they will allow us to follow a path from $t=0$ to $t=\pi/2$   in the steepest descent sense, namely $$\gamma_1(x,y) = \cos x\cosh y - 1$$ which will takes us from $(x,y)=(0,0)$  to $(x,y)=\left( \frac{\pi}{2}-\epsilon,-R \right)$, with $R$ very large and $\epsilon$ a small positive quantity (this path will be named $C_1$), and $$\gamma_3(x,y) = \cos x\cosh y $$ which will takes us from $(x,y)=\left( \frac{\pi}{2},-R \right)$  to $(x,y)=\left( \frac{\pi}{2},0 \right)$ (this path will be named $C_3$). To join paths $C_1$ and $C_3$, we need to resort to another path $C_2$, parallel to the x-axis, which will takes us from $(x,y)=\left( \frac{\pi}{2}-\epsilon,-R \right)$ to $(x,y)= \left( \frac{\pi}{2},-R \right)$. These are the contour lines of $\operatorname{Re} \phi(t) = \sin x\sinh y$ (darker means smaller) So, to apply the method of steepest descent we should take the following contour We have then $$\int\limits_0^{\pi / 2} {e^{ix\cos t}}dt = \int\limits_{{C_1}} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt}  + \int\limits_{{C_2}} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt}  + \int\limits_{{C_3}} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt}.$$ Now, making  $R \rightarrow \infty$, the lenght of $C_2$ becomes arbitrarily small as does the integrand, which decays exponentially in the direction of steepest descent, so the contribution of this integral is negligible. To compute the contour integral along path $C_1$, we use a substitution of the form $\phi(t) = -u + ik$, so that the exponential in the integrand becomes $\exp (-xu + ix)$, as  $k=1$ on $C_1$. We then have $$t = \arccos (1 + iu) \to \frac{dt}{du} = - \frac{i}{\sqrt{1- (1 + iu)^2}} \Rightarrow dt = 
\frac{1 - i}{2 \sqrt{u} \sqrt{1 + iu/2}}du$$ and, from $u(t) = i(1- \cos t) = i - \sin x\sinh y - i\underbrace {\cos x\cosh y}_{ = 1} = - \sin x\sinh y$, we get
$$u(0 + i0) = - \sin 0 \sinh 0 = 0$$ and $$u\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-i\infty \right) = - \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2} \right) \sinh(-\infty) = + \infty.$$ We finally arrive at $$\tag{3} \int\limits_{C_1} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt}  =  e^{ix} \int\limits_0^{+\infty} {\frac{1 - i}{2\sqrt{u} \sqrt{1 + iu/2}} e^{-xu} du}.$$ Regarding the contour integral along path $C_3$, we use a substitution of the form $\phi(t) = -u + ik$, so that the exponential in the integrand becomes $\exp (-xu)$, as  $k=0$ on $C_3$. We then have $$t = \arccos (iu) \to \frac{dt}{du} = - \frac{i}{\sqrt{1 + u^2}} \Rightarrow dt = 
- \frac{i}{\sqrt{1 + u^2}}du$$ and, from $u(t) = - i \cos t) = - \sin x\sinh y - i\underbrace {\cos x\cosh y}_{ = 0} = - \sin x\sinh y$, we get
$$u\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-i\infty \right) = - \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \sinh (-\infty) = +\infty$$ and $$u\left(\frac{\pi}{2} + i0 \right) = - \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2} \right) \sinh(0) = 0.$$ We finally arrive at $$\tag{4} \int\limits_{C_3} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt}  =  \int\limits_0^{+\infty} {\frac{i}{\sqrt{1 + u^2}} e^{-xu} du}.$$ We are now able to find the asymptotic series for both (3) and (4) , using Watson’s lemma. The first result we need is the following MacLaurin series $$\tag{5} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 4x}} \sim \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty  {\frac{(2k)!x^k}{(n!)^2}}. $$ Now, making the substitution $x=-iu/8$ in (5) and multiplying by $(1-i) / u^{1/2} = \sqrt{2} e^{-i \pi/4} / u^{1/2}$, we get $$\tag{6} \frac{1 - i}{2 \sqrt{u} \sqrt{1 + iu/2}} \sim \frac{e^{-i \pi/4}}{\sqrt{2}} \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty  {\frac{(2k)! (-i)^k u^{k-1/2}}{8^k (k!)^2}}.$$ Similarly, making the substitution $x=-u^2/4$ in (5) and multiplying by $i$, we get $$\tag{7} \frac{i}{\sqrt{1 + u^2}} \sim \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty  {\frac{i(2k)! (-1)^k u^{2k}}{4^k (k!)^2}}.$$ Finally, applying Watson’s lemma we arrive at $$\begin{align} \int\limits_0^{\pi / 2} {e^{ix\cos t}}dt &\sim \int\limits_{{C_1}} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt} + \int\limits_{{C_3}} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt} \\
&\sim {\frac{e^{i(x - \pi/4)}}{\sqrt{2}} \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty  \frac{(2k)! (-i)^k \Gamma(k+1/2)}{8^k (k!)^2 x^{k+1/2}}} + \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty  {\frac{i (-1)^k (2k)! \Gamma(2k+1)}{4^k (k!)^2 x^{2k+1}}}.\end{align}$$ So, for example, the first two terms in the asymptotic series would be
$$\int\limits_0^{\pi / 2} {e^{ix\cos t}}dt \sim \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2x}} e^{i({x-\pi/4})} + \frac{i}{x}.$$ Is my reasoning correct?
Is there any way to check the final result? Thanks in advance!","['definite-integrals', 'asymptotics', 'integration']"

Simplifying the resultant mess indeed yields the above identity.

What does it mean, in measure theoretic terms, to draw a sample from $X$? When $\Omega$ is finite, things make sense: we might say nature rolls its dice and draws an $\omega \in \Omega$ according to $\mathbb{P}$, and our sample is simply $X(\omega)$. In uncountably infinite domains its not clear to me how this is defined.  As we all know, every element $\omega \in \Omega$ has zero measure, only measurable subsets $A \subseteq \Omega$ have measure.  But sampling implies getting elements of $\Omega$.
How does one reconcile the idea of drawing a sample $x$ from some distribution with the fact that $P(X=x) = 0$? And yet, I can call the rand function in my favourite programming language and it will sample from a continuous distribution.  But of course it is not really continuous, it is a floating point approximation.  Could it be that the discretisation is required to have a well-defined notion of sampling?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'sampling']"

Then $f^\omega : X \rightarrow X$ also kind of makes sense; basically, for any $x \in X$, we say that $f^\omega(x)$ is well-defined iff the sequence $i < \omega \mapsto f^{i}(x)$ converges, in which case $f^\omega(x)$ is taken to equal $\mathrm{lim}_{i<\omega}f^{i}(x).$ Proceeding in this way, we should be able to raise $f$ to the power of an arbitrary ordinal. Along a similar vein, suppose that $\alpha$ is an ordinal and that $f : \alpha \rightarrow \mathrm{Par}(X,X)$ is a sequence of partial function $X \rightarrow X$.

817011,"To what extent is it possible to generalise a natural bijection between trees and $7$-tuples of trees, suggested by divergent series?","In the paper ""Seven Trees In One"" by Andreas Blass, a ""very explicit"" bijection is found between trees and 7-tuples of such trees. The idea to construct such a bijection stems from looking at some particular divergent series, as mentioned in Chapter 2 of the paper: To see why seven is special, we ﬁrst give an argument to establish Theorem 1
  in the style of eighteenth-century analysis, where meaningless computations (e.g.,
  manipulating divergent series as though they converged absolutely and uniformly)
  somehow gave correct results. This argument begins with the observation that a
  tree either is 0 or splits naturally into two subtrees (by removing the root). Thus
  the set T of trees satisﬁes $T = 1 + T^
2$
  . (Of course equality here actually means
  an obvious isomorphism. Note that the same equation holds also for the variant
  notions of tree mentioned at the end of Section 1.) Solving this quadratic equation
  for T, we ﬁnd $T =
1/2
 ± i \sqrt{3}/2 $
  . (The reader who objects that this is nonsense has
  not truly entered into the eighteenth-century spirit.) These complex numbers are
  primitive sixth roots of unity, so we have $T^
6 = 1$ and $T^
7 = T$. And this is why
  seven-tuples of trees can be coded as single trees. A more elaborate explanation can be found here . Mr. Blass does not elaborate a lot on the divergent series he mentioned. This is explained in a bit more detail in a blog post on the ""Everything Seminar"". The divergent sum of the Catalan numbers (where the $n$'th Catalan number is defined as $C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} $) is computed by looking at the corresponding generating function of these numbers: $$ T(z) =  1 + z + 2z^2 + 5z^3 + 14z^4 + 42z^5 + \dots $$ It is mentioned in that blog post that the coefficient of $x^n$ is the number of binary rooted trees with $n+1$ leaves. Combining these pieces of information, it can be computed that $$T(z) = \frac{1- \sqrt{1-4z}}{2z} .  $$ By plugging in $x=1$, we obtain that $$ 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 14 + 42 + \dots ""="" \frac{1}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = e^{-\pi i/3} . $$ Therefore, we ""know"" that $$ 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 14 + 42 + \dots ""="" (1 + z + 2 + 5 + 14 + 42 + \dots)^7 $$ This suggested the bijection in the paper by Blass. I am curious, though, whether there are more instances of divergent series that suggest bijections between certain combinatorial objects. For instance, we also have the Fibonacci generating function $$ F(z) = 1 + z + 2z^2 + 3z^3 + 5z^4 + 8z^5 + \dots = \frac{z}{1-z-z^2} .  $$ (Here, the $n$'th coefficient is defined as $f_{n} = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} $, where $f_0 = f_1 = 1$.) If we let $z$ go to $1$, we find that $$ 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + \dots ""="" -1 .$$ Therefore, we find that $$ 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + \dots ""="" (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + \dots)^{2k+1} \qquad (1), $$ is true as well, for integer $k > 0 $ . Question 1 : Does this ""equality"" (1) involving the Fibonacci divergent series admit a combinatorial interpretation as well? Can a bijection between combinatorial structures similar to the one mentioned in Blass' paper be constructed based on this interpretation as well? Furthermore, we can compute that $$ 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \dots = -1 $$ by means of a generating function as well. (Here, the $n$'th term is of the form $2^n$.) So we have $$ 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \dots = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \dots)^{2k+1} \qquad (2)  $$ for integer $k>0$ as well. Question 2 : Does equality (2) admit a combinatorial interpretation and a corresponding ""very explicit"" bijection as well? Question 3 : If there are combinatorial interpretations of equalities (1) and (2), could there exist ""very explicit"" bijections between these different combinatorial structures too?","['divergent-series', 'combinatorics']"

Doing a discrete math review and am trying to solve problem 1.6 in the text found here: http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/fall13/ch1-to-3.pdf - I believe I've gotten parts (a) and (b) correctly, but (c) is a bit tricky for me. Would appreciate a review of a/b and a hint for c if possible. Restatement here: For n = 40, the value of polynomial $p(n)::=n^2 + n + 41$ is not prime, as noted
in Section 1.1. But we could have predicted based on general principles that no
nonconstant polynomial can generate only prime numbers. In particular, let $q(n)$ be a polynomial with integer coefﬁcients, and let $c::=q(0)$
be the constant term of q. (a) Verify that $q(cm)$ is a multiple of c for all $m \in Z$ Proof:
Since q is a polynomial, it will be of the form:
$q(x) = a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + c$ If $x = cm$, then notice that cm will be inside every term of the polynomial, and since the final term is c, c can be factored out of every term. Hence, q(cm) is a multiple of c for all $m \in Z$. b) Show that if q is nonconstant and c > 1, then as n ranges over the nonnegative integers, $N$, there are infinitely many $q(n) \in Z$ that are not primes. Proof: Continuing from the result found in (a), it is easy to see that for all $m \in Z$, there will be an infinite number of multiples of c that will be generated by q. Since c > 1, these multiples are guaranteed not to be prime. c) Conclude that for every nonconstant polynomial, q, there must be an $n \in N$ such that $q(n)$ is not prime. Hint: Only one easy case remains. c = 0 is trivially easy to prove using the (b) above. I assume the ""easy"" case is referring to c = 1, but in this case I'm not sure how to continue, since the result of (a) and (b) don't apply: I can't use them since adding 1 to any even number may make it prime. If the result of the terms not including c is odd, then adding 1 to that result makes it even and it is not prime. However, if the terms add up to an even number, I don't see a way of using the knowledge I have so far to prove conclusively that that number + 1 will NOT in fact be prime.","['prime-numbers', 'polynomials', 'elementary-number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"
