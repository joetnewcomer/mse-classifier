3494386,Number of ways to label die with opposing faces summing to 7,"A friend and I have a disagreement about the number of unique ways to label the faces of a six-sided die with integers from one to six so that each pair of opposing faces sums to seven. I think the answer is 8 since swapping each pair of opposing faces results in (I think) a different handedness for the two hemi cubes centered on the two faces being swapped, without affecting the other hemi cubes. So I think the problem is represented by the possible independent states of the three opposing pairs, giving $2^3=8$ permutations. My friend thinks the answer is 2, as he argues that a single swap changes the handedness of the entire die , and that further independent swaps can’t further change the die’s handedness, and thus don’t generate unique states.

3494451,Is there a linear mapping $L$ that is not a scalar multiple of the identity?,"Let $V$ be an $n$ -dimensional vector space. Can we find a linear map $A : V\to V$ with $n+1$ eigenvectors, any $n$ of which are linearly independent, which is not a scalar multiple of the identity? Here's a solution I found.
The answer is no. Let the $n+1$ corresponding eigenvalues have sum $k$ . Given any eigenvector with eigenvalue $\lambda,$ the remaining $n$ eigenvectors are linearly independent, so they form a basis. The basis formed by the remaining $n$ eigenvectors diagonalizes the matrix of the linear transformation. The trace of the resulting matrix is $k-\lambda$ . Since trace is independent of the choice of basis, all eigenvalues are equal to lambda. Hence $A$ is a scalar matrix (i.e. a scalar multiple of the identity). I still can't convince myself that $A$ is a scalar matrix. What if $A$ is a matrix such that it that satisfies the given conditions and before it is diagonalized by the basis, it is not a scalar multiple of the identity?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'linear-transformations']"

3494530,Why does the beta distribution become U shaped when $\alpha$ and $\beta$ <1?,"In the Beta distribution (used to model Bernoulli probabilities), the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters can be interpreted as the number of heads $+1$ and the number of tails $+1$ seen. So, if they were both $2$ , it would lean towards the coin being fair and have a maximum at $0.5$ . If they are both $20$ , the distribution would become even surer we're dealing with a fair coin and peak even more at $p=0.5$ . What I don't get is its behavior when $\alpha$ and $\beta$ both become $<1$ . In that case, it becomes U-shaped and the density peaks at $p=0$ and $p=1$ . Meaning the coin is likely to be two-sided.

3494541,Combinatorial approach to prove divisibility results with the sequence $u_{n+p+1} = u_{n+p} + u_{n}$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$,"For a fixed prime number $p$ , we consider the sequence : $$\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
u_n = 1, & 0\leq n \leq p \\
u_{n+p+1} = u_{n+p} + u_n
\end{array}\right.
$$ I want to prove that $\forall a \in \mathbb{N},\ p|u_{pa}-u_a$ My attempt : I think that there are two natural approaches to tackle this problem: One way is to apply results about linear sequences, but i'm not very familiar with how it should be done in the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ .
We thus consider the characteristic polynomial $Q(X) := X^{p+1}-X^p-1$ in the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ . One can easily check that $Q'(X) = X^p$ and has only $0$ as a root, which is not a root of $Q(X)$ , thus every roots of $Q(X)$ are simple. If we could say that $u_n = \sum_{k} \lambda_k\alpha_k^n$ with $\alpha_k$ roots of $Q(X)$ , then we would be done by Fermat's theorem. My problem is that I think that $Q(X)$ has at most $2$ roots, that are those of $X^2-X-1$ (and actually we would need that $5$ is a square $mod(p)$ , ie. that $p$ must be either $1\ mod(5)$ or $-1\  mod(5)$ by quadratic reciprocity) The second approach is more combinatorial, and use the fact that $u_n$ can be interpreted as the number of ways one can tile a $(p+1)\times n$ rectangle with $(p+1)\times 1$ dominos. Indeed the relationship can be derived by observing that a $(p+1)\times(n+p+1)$ tiling is either a $(p+1)\times(n+p)$ tiling with a vertical domino filing the last slice, or a $(p+1)\times n$ tiling with $(p+1)$ horizontal domino filing the remaining square. If we consider a $(p+1)\times pa$ rectangle, then we can ""naturally"" slice it in $p$ rectangles of size $(p+1)\times a$ . There are $u_a^p$ ways of tiling the initial rectangle with dominos that doesn't ""cut"" a small rectangle. By Fermat's theorem, we need to show that the number of tilings $v_{pa}$ having a domino that ""cut"" a small rectangle is a multiple of $p$ , because we would have $u_{pa} = u_a^p + v_{pa} = u_a\ mod(p)$ . I don't know how to show this. The ideal proof would be to find an action splitting the possible tilings into $p$ orbits of the same size for example. I also tried to explicit $v_{bp}$ with the inclusion-exclusion principle (but I assumed $a\geq 2p$ so that's not very satisfying): If we note the inner vertical edges of the small rectangles from left to right by $1,\dots,p-1$ we can try to split by the events $A_j = \{ \text{tilings with a domino cuting the edge}\ j\}$ and I found, if not mistaken: $$
v_{pa} = \sum_{k=1}^{p-1}(-1)^{k-1}\sum_{1\leq i_1 \leq \dots \leq i_k \leq p-1}\ \sum_{n^k \in \{1,\dots,p\}^k}\ \prod_{j=1}^{k+1}(u_{i_j a - (p+1-n_{j-1}^k+n_j^k)})
$$ with the boundary conditions $i_{k+1} = p-\sum_{j=0}^k i_j$ and $n_0^k = n_{k+1}^k = 0$ , but I'm not sure we can make something out of it. Because I haven't got a proof of this result, anything would be welcomed but I'm particularly curious about where the combinatorial approach would lead as it seems more elementary.","['finite-fields', 'linear-algebra', 'combinatorial-proofs', 'combinatorics']"

3494782,Closed forms of $f(s;q)=\sum_{k\ge1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k^s+q^s}$,"I am investigating closed forms of the function $$f(s;q)=\sum_{k\ge1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k^s+q^s}.$$ I of course don't expect a closed form for general $s$ and $q$ (such that the series converges), but I am rather interested in special cases. There is of course the easily-shown relation $$f(s;0)=(2^{1-s}-1)\zeta(s),$$ from which it is immediately evident that $f$ is some sort of analog of the classic zeta function. My efforts have mostly been focused on special cases for fixed values of $s$ , such as the easily shown $$f(1;q)=\int_0^1\frac{x^qdx}{1+x}.$$ Note that since this integral has no closed form for general $q$ , I am willing to count the integral itself as a closed form, as it is certainly easy to evaluate for $q\in\Bbb Q_{\ge0}$ . If something similar is the best we can do in other cases, so be it. My own work has been primarily regarding the cases $f(2^n;q)$ , and I have succeeded in finding a recurrence in $n$ . First, we evaluate $f(2;q)$ . To do so we define $\zeta_m=\exp\frac{i\pi}{m}$ , as we will use it a lot later. Recall the formula $$\frac{\pi}{\sin\pi z}=\sum_{k\in\Bbb Z}\frac{(-1)^k}{z+k},$$ so that $$\sum_{k\ge 1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k^2-z^2}=-\frac\pi{2z\sin\pi z}+\frac1{2z^2}.$$ Setting $z=iq$ and simplifying gives $$f(2;q)=\sum_{k\ge1}\frac{(-1)^k}{k^2+q^2}=\frac{\pi e^{\pi q}/q}{e^{2\pi q}-1}-\frac1{2q^2}.$$ This, interestingly enough, gives the limit $$\lim_{q\to 0}\left(\frac{\pi e^{\pi q}/q}{e^{2\pi q}-1}-\frac1{2q^2}\right)=-\frac{\pi^2}{12}.$$ I would like to discuss this limit further, but that may not be on topic on this post. Back to the investigation at hand, we see that $$\begin{align}
f(2M;q)&=\sum_{k\ge1}\frac{(-1)^k}{(k^{M}-iq^{M})(k^{M}+iq^{M})}\qquad [M=2^n]\\
&=\frac{1}{2iq^M}\sum_{k\ge1}(-1)^k\left(\frac{1}{k^M-iq^M}-\frac{1}{k^M+iq^M}\right)\\
&=\tfrac{1}{2iq^M}f(M;\zeta_{2M}^3q)-\tfrac{1}{2iq^M}f(M;\zeta_{2M}q).
\end{align}$$ Thus, since we know $f(2;q)$ , we also know $f(M;q)$ . So, my question: For what other values of $s$ can $f(s;q)$ be evaluated in closed form?","['special-functions', 'analysis', 'closed-form', 'sequences-and-series', 'zeta-functions']"

Let furthermore $f : (\{0, \ldots, n\})^d \rightarrow \mathbb{B}$ be some monotone oracle function, i.e., such that for each $\vec x, \vec x' \in (\{0, \ldots, n\})^d$ with $\vec x \leq_d \vec x'$ with $f(\vec x)=\mathbf{true}$ , we have $f(\vec x')=\mathbf{true}$ , where $\leq_d$ is the product order over elements from $(\{0, \ldots, n\})^d$ . We say that some point $\vec x$ is a Pareto point for $f$ if $f(x)=\mathbf{true}$ and for no $\vec x \neq \vec x'$ , we have $\vec x' \leq_d \vec x$ and $f(x)=\mathbf{true}$ . Likewise, a co-Pareto point is some point $\vec x$ with $f(x)=\mathbf{false}$ and for no $\vec x \neq \vec x'$ , we have $\vec x \leq_d \vec x'$ and $f(x)=\mathbf{false}$ . By these definitions, every oracle function $f$ has a fixed number of Pareto points $c_p(f)$ and co-Pareto points $c_c(f)$ . Question: How many co-Pareto points can a function $f$ have at most have for a given number of Pareto points $c_p(f)$ and for a given number of dimensions $d \in \mathbb{N}$ ? More precisely, I am searching for an as-simple-as-possible representation of a function $g : \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1} \times \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $(d, c) \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 1}^2 $ , we have: $$
g(d,c) = \max_{n \in \mathbb{N}, f : (\{0, \ldots, n\})^d \rightarrow \mathbb{B}, f \text{ is monotone}, c_p(f) = c} c_c(f)
$$ Background: This question is rooted in multicriterial optimization over a discrete space of potential solutions. For instance, let $d = 2$ and $f$ be a function that maps from a number of bread rolls and a number of cabbages to whether there is some recipe for making dinner for a football team with these ingredients. If we have a combination of bread rolls and cabbages that is suitable for making dinner, then adding more bread rolls or adding cabbages will not change this. Hence, $f$ is monotone. For some fixed upper bound $n$ , we can draw the values of $f$ into a diagram as follows: Here, the dark green cells represent the Pareto points, i.e., the smallest combinations of resources suitable for making dinner. The dark blue cells, on the other hand, represent the co-Pareto points, i.e., the largest combinations of resources not suitable for making dinner. In can be seen that for the function $f$ depicted in the Figure, we have $c_p(f)=4$ , and $c_c(f)=5$ . For $d=2$ , it should be relatively easy to show that indeed the worst-case number of co-Pareto points is always the number of Pareto points plus one. Hence, we should have $$
g(2,c) = c+1
$$ But for higher number of dimensions, the shape of $g$ is unknown. I acknowledge that I may simply have the wrong search terms to find a  publication with a suitable result. Known Lower Bound: For even $d = c$ , we have that $g(d,c) \geq 3^{(c/2)}$ . To see this, consider the set of Pareto points of the following form (for $0 \leq i < c/2-1$ ): $$
(\underbrace{0,0,\ldots}_{2i \text{ many } 0s},1,2,\underbrace{\ldots,0,0}_{(c-2i-2) \text{ many } 0s})
$$ and $$
(\underbrace{0,0,\ldots}_{2i \text{ many } 0s},2,1,\underbrace{\ldots,0,0}_{(c-2i-2) \text{ many } 0s})
$$ The co-Pareto points in this case are arbitrary concatenations of $c/2$ many elements from of $\{(0,n), (1,1), (n,0)\}$ , such as: $(0,n,0,n,\ldots,0,n)$ $(0,n,0,n,\ldots,1,1)$ $(0,n,0,n,\ldots,n,0)$ $\ldots$ $(n,0,n,0,\ldots,n,0)$","['discrete-optimization', 'combinatorics']"

It is easy to see that $\ker\varphi = \{h\mid \mathrm{Im} f\subseteq\ker h\}$ so that $\dim\ker\varphi = (n-\mathrm{rk} f)\cdot n = n\cdot \dim\ker f$ .
So that by rank theorem, $\mathrm{rank}\varphi = n(n - \dim\ker f) = n\cdot\mathrm{rank}(f)$ . To conclure, notice that $\mathrm{Im}(f) \subseteq \{h\mid \ker f\subseteq \ker h\}$ but the last vector-space is of dimension $n\cdot\mathrm{rank}(f)$ so we have equality.

At the end of the election both candidates receive the same amount of votes. What is the probability $P$ that candidate $C_1$ leads during the whole election process until the penultimate vote? (The last vote must always be in favor of candidate $C_2$ ) This question was presented in our lecture in the context of the ballot-theorem . So one should think of paths which start at $(0, 0)$ along the $x$ -axis and end at some point $(n,s)$ , where $n,s \in \mathbb{Z}$ . My approach: My sample space $\Omega$ includes all possible paths along the $x$ -axis. If the path is above the $x$ -axis then candidate $C_1$ has more votes and if the path is below then $C_2$ has more votes . If the paths touches the $x$ -axis then both candidates have the same amount of votes. Hence, $|\Omega|={2p \choose p}$ , where $p \in \mathbb{N}$ is the number of votes of each candidate. Firstly, I count all paths which start at $(1,1)$ and end at $(2p,0)$ . These are ${2p-1 \choose p-1}$ many. Now I subtract all paths that touch the $x$ -axis, these are ${2p-2 \choose p-2}$ many.

One can interpret all these paths as desired outcomes, i.e. where candidate $C_1$ leads until the penultimate vote. As all paths are equally probable I get the solution just by dividing by $|\Omega|={2p \choose p}$ . Hence, $P = \frac{{2p-1 \choose p-1}-{2p-2 \choose p-2}}{{2p \choose p}}$ .

3495120,The calculation of the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1}\frac{H_{2n}}{n^4}$,"Happy New Year 2020, Romania In this recent post, Evaluate $\int_0^1 \frac{\arctan x\ln^2 x}{1+x^2}\,dx$ , the proposed integral reduces to the calculation of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1}\frac{H_{2n}}{n^3}$ which is known in the literature. Now, what can we say about the more advanced version of it, the one with $n^4$ in the denominator? $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1}\frac{H_{2n}}{n^4}$$ Can we do it by series manipulations? It looks like a new series in the literature. A good note : With the previous result in hand which we combine with some of the Cornel 's work, we immediately arrive at two delightful series results, $$i) \ \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }(-1)^{n-1} \frac{ H_{2 n}^{(2)}}{n^3}=\frac{61 }{192}\pi ^2 \zeta (3)+\frac{1973 }{128}\zeta (5)+\frac{\pi ^5}{16}-\frac{1}{128} \pi  \psi ^{(3)}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right);$$ $$ii) \ \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } (-1)^{n-1} \frac{ H_{2 n}^{(3)}}{n^2}=\frac{\pi ^3 G}{8}+\frac{1}{64}\pi ^2 \zeta (3)-\frac{2997 }{256}\zeta (5)-\frac{\pi ^5}{32}+\frac{1}{256} \pi  \psi ^{(3)}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right).$$ How would you go proving these last two results?

3495231,Separability of bounded operators on normed spaces,"In the case of Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H$ , $\mathcal G$ it is known that the Banach space of all bounded operators $\mathcal B(\mathcal H,\mathcal G)$ is norm-separable if and only if $\operatorname{dim}(\mathcal H)<\infty$ and $\mathcal G$ is separable (or vice versa). In particular if $\operatorname{dim}(\mathcal H)=\infty$ then $\mathcal B(\mathcal H)$ is never norm-separable (regardless of whether $\mathcal H$ is separable or not) as is usually shown via a diagonal argument which isometrically embeds the non-separable space $\ell^\infty$ into $\mathcal B(\mathcal H)$ . The overall question I am interested in is: Given infinite-dimensional normed spaces $X,Y$ (where at least one is not a Hilbert space) is $\mathcal B(X,Y)$ non-separable? Can an affirmative answer be given for some special cases (such as $X=Y$ , or $X$ Banach, or $X$ having a Schauder basis, etc.)? If so what is the idea of the proof? I would like to sketch the Hilbert space argument in more detail to point out where I see issues arising from passing over to more general spaces. Given an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ (and assuming the axiom of choice) we can find an orthonormal basis $\{x_i\}_{i\in I}$ of $\mathcal H$ (w.l.o.g. $\mathbb N\subset I$ ). This yields an orthonormal system $\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ in $\mathcal H$ which---for any $z\in\ell^\infty$ ---lets us define $T_{z,0}(x_n):=z_nx_n$ for all $n\in\mathbb N$ and $T_{z,0}(x_i):=0$ for all $i\in I\setminus\mathbb N$ together with the linear extension onto all of $\mathcal H_0:=\operatorname{span}\{x_i\}_{i\in I}$ . Thus $T\in\mathcal L(\mathcal H_0)$ and, moreover $$
\|T_{z,0}\|=\sup_{x\in\mathcal H,\|x\|=1}\|T_{z,0}x\|\geq\sup_{n\in\mathbb N}\|T_{z,0}x_n\|=\sup_{n\in\mathbb N}|z_n|=\|z\|\,.
$$ For the converse let any unit vector $x\in\mathcal H_0$ be given so one finds coefficients $\alpha_k$ such that $x=\sum_{k=1}^m \alpha_k x_{n_k}+\sum_{k=1}^{m'}\alpha_k' x_{i_k}$ (where $n_1,\ldots,n_m\in\mathbb N$ and $i_1,\ldots,i_k\in I\setminus\mathbb N$ ). Using the Pythagorean theorem this yields $$
\|T_{z,0}x\|^2=\Big\|\sum\nolimits_{k=1}^m \alpha_k z_{n_k}x_{n_k}\Big\|^2=\sum\nolimits_{k=1}^m|\alpha_k|^2|z_{n_k}|^2\leq \|z\|^2\sum\nolimits_{k=1}^m|\alpha_k|^2\leq \|z\|^2\|x\|^2\tag{1}
$$ Thus in total $\|T_{z,0}\|=\|z\|$ and $T_{z_0}\in\mathcal B(\mathcal H_0)\subset\mathcal B(\mathcal H_0,\mathcal H)$ . Because $\overline{\mathcal H_0}=\mathcal H$ (orthonormal basis property) there exists a unique extension $T_z\in\mathcal B(\mathcal H)$ with $\|T_z\|=\|T_{z_0}\|$ so the map $$
\iota:\ell^\infty\to\mathcal B(\mathcal H)\qquad z\mapsto T_z
$$ is well-defined, linear and an isometry. But with this the standard proof that $\ell^\infty$ is not separable transfers onto $\mathcal B(\mathcal H)$ showing non-separability of the latter. $$\boxed{\text{So far, so standard.}}$$ (1) The easiest generalization one might think of is the case of $\mathcal B(X)$ where $X$ is a Banach space which has a Schauder basis $\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ (w.l.o.g. $\|x_n\|=1$ ). Pursuing the Hilbert space idea given $z\in\ell^\infty$ one can define an operator $T_{z,0}\in\mathcal L(X_0)$ via $T_{z,0}x_n:=z_nx_n$ on $X_0:=\operatorname{span}\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ which satisfies $\|T_{z,0}\|\geq \|z\|$ . Problem 1: Why should $T_{z,0}$ be bounded? (After all (1) crucially relies on the Pythagorean theorem and there to my knowledge is no general connection between the coefficients $\alpha_k$ and $\|\sum_{k=1}^m\alpha_k x_{n_k}\|_X$ ) Assuming we can surmount these difficulties we get a unique extension (because of the Schauder basis property and because $X$ is a Banach space) $T_z\in\mathcal B(X)$ so the map $\iota:\ell^\infty\to\mathcal B(X)$ , $z\mapsto T_z$ is well-defined, linear and satisfies $\|T_z\|=\|T_{z_0}\|\geq \|z\|$ . This is enough to carry over the non-separabilty argument of $\ell^\infty$ because $\|T_z-T_{\tilde z}\|=\|T_{z-\tilde z}\|\geq\|z-\tilde z\|$ . (2) The next step would ask about $\mathcal B(X,Y)$ where $X,Y$ are Banach spaces ( $X\neq Y$ ) and $X$ has a Schauder basis. Same procedure as before but now take a set $\{y_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of linearly independent unit vectors in $Y$ and define $T_{z,0}x_n:=z_ny_n$ . Then $T_{z,0}\in\mathcal L(X_0,Y)$ with $\|T_{z,0}\|\geq\|z\|$ . Problem 2: Why should $T_{z,0}$ be bounded? (Following Problem 1 we additionally have to deal with the problem of $\|\cdot\|_Y$ being independent of $\|\cdot\|_X$ , i.e. we would have to relate the coefficients $\alpha_k$ of $\sum_{k=1}^m\alpha_kx_{n_k}$ with the norm of the image $\sum_{k=1}^m\alpha_k\boxed{y_{n_k}}$ ) Solving this problem would enable us to finish the argument as before. (3) Assuming things did not break down until here the most general (and also the most unpleasant) case to consider is the one of the domain being an arbitrary Banach space $X$ . As before one could find an infinite set $\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ of linearly independent unit vectors in $X$ (and similarly for $Y$ ) to define $T_{z,0}:X_0\to Y$ via $T_{z,0}x_n:=z_ny_n$ where $X_0:=\operatorname{span}\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ . Again $\|T_{z,0}\|\geq\|z\|$ . Problem 3 : Even if one could prove that $T_{z,0}$ is bounded how would one extend $T_{z,0}$ to a bounded operator on all of $X$ ? (We assume that $X$ does not have a Schauder basis anymore so $X_0$ is not dense in $X$ no matter how we choose our linearly independent unit vectors. Thus the image of $X\setminus \overline{X_0}$ has to be decided on beyond the usual continuity argument) Such an extension seems possible if $T_{z,0}$ is of finite rank or if $Y$ is an injective space but seems dangerous in general. These are most of the thoughts I had on this topic up until now. I of course am aware that there might be a more general argument (beyond this diagonal one) which settles (non-)separability of $\mathcal B(X,Y)$ for general normed spaces $X,Y$ . Either way I am thankful for any comments and or ideas!","['banach-spaces', 'operator-theory', 'normed-spaces', 'separable-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

3495383,Relations or functions other than $\in$ in first order formulas in ZF,"According to my understanding of first order logic, a first order formula in ZF must only contain the relation symbol $\in$ and no function symbols.

My book explains for example that $\forall a \forall b \exists c \forall v_0\ (v_0 \in c \iff (v_0 \in a \vee v_0 \in b))$ is a theorem of ZF. But then it goes on to treat this as a function. By my understanding $\forall v_0(v_0 \in a \cup b \iff (v_0 \in a \vee v_0 \in b))$ is not a first order formula in the language of ZF because it contains $\cup$ which is not a symbol in the language of ZF. Is there a formal explanation of why this formula is allowed, and how to introduce new function symbols, or is this formula actually some slightly informal logic, and we just have to believe that there is a formula using only the $\in$ symbol equivalent to that formula? Obviously stating any maths theorem using just $\in$ is really hard. For example how would one state $\forall x \ y \in \mathbb{N}, x + y = y + x$ ?

It's also immediate that we have the circumcircle (and hence the circumcenter) of $\triangle ABC$ , but making use of the relationships between the circumcenter and the medians via, say, the perpendicular bisectors is also tricky since obviously I don't have the sides of the triangle. Something else I've tried is letting $X$ , $Y$ , and $Z$ denote the intersections of the symmedians through $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ with the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ , respectively, and noting that the symmedian of $\triangle XYZ$ equals the symmedian point of $\triangle ABC$ .

Now let's imagine a sphere with radius $R$ . Let's center it at the origin of the standard 3-dimensional space so that its top point is located at $(0,0,r)$ and its bottom point is centered at $(0,0,-r)$ . Now we will remove the bottom hemisphere and let the top hemisphere stay. The surface area of the top part is equal to half the whole sphere so it is equal to $2\pi r^2$ . Now consider the point $(0,0,-r)$ and call it $P$ . It is clear that every point on the top hemisphere can be connected using straight lines to our point. All points of the top hemisphere pass through the equator of our sphere which is a circle centered at the origin defined by $x^2+y^2=r^2$ which has area $\pi r^2$ . All points on the hemisphere correspond bijectively to points on the circle. This implies that there are equal points on the sphere and our circle which implies that the hemisphere has surface area $\pi r^2$ . But we know that the surface area of the hemisphere is $2\pi r^2$ . This is only true if and only if $2=1$ . This is clearly wrong, where have I gone wrong?

Further, the function $x(t)$ should be bijective on $[0, t_0]$ This is how I got a solution for $x(t)$ . I just guessed what seemed right until I got it working. Perhaps there also exists a polynomial solution. $$\ddot x=-rsin(t)$$ Thus $\ddot x(0)=0$ and $\ddot x(t_0) \implies t_0 \in 0,\pi,2\pi , ...$ $\dot x(t) = rcos(t) + C_1$ $\dot x(0) = 0 = r + C_1$ $\dot x(t_0) = 0 = rcos(t_0) + C_1$ Since $t_0 \in 0, \pi, 2\pi,...$ . We can isolate $C_1$ if we force $t_0 = 2\pi$ Thus $\dot x(t_0) = 0 = r + C_1 \implies C_1 = -r$ $x(t)=rsin(t) - rt + C_2$ $x(0) = x_a = C_2$ $x(t_0) = x_b = rsin(2\pi) - r2\pi + C_2 \implies r = \dfrac{x_a - x_b}{2\pi}$ Therefore, $x(t) = rsin(t) - rx + x_a$ , where $r = \dfrac{x_a - x_b}{2\pi}$ Now here is where I am stuck.

The Artin $L$ -series $L(E/K,\chi,s)$ admits an analytic continuation holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$ . A trivial consequence of inductive invariance is that: $$
\zeta_E(s) = \zeta_K(s) \prod_{\chi \neq \chi_0}L(E/K,\chi,s)
$$ The product being taken over all non-trivial simple characters of $\textrm{Gal}(E/K)$ . A corollary of this is that for a Galois extension $E/K$ , the ratio of the corresponding $\zeta$ -functions, $\frac{\zeta_E(s)}{\zeta_K(s)}$ is holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$ . This has in fact been proved by other means - without assuming the Artin conjecture - and is known as the Aramata-Brauer theorem. On p. 83 of $\textit{An Introduction to the Langlands Programme}$ Ehud de Shalit says that: The corresponding theorem for non-Galois $K/k$ is open, although it would follow from the [Artin] conjecture. That is to say, he claims that the holomorphicity of the ratio of zeta functions follows from the Artin conjecture. I have been trying to prove this, but have had some difficulties circumventing the fact that we cannot make sense of the $L$ -series related to non-Galois extensions $E/K$ . One could take the normal closure (say $E \subset N$ ), but then one would be dealing with $N/K$ , which would show that the ratio of the $\zeta$ -functions corresponding to this extension is entire, but how could we relate this to $E/K$ ? So why does the Artin conjecture imply the holomorphicity of the ratio of the zeta function?

3496098,Short Exact Sequences as Fiber Bundles,"I am very much a visual thinker, and so to me, to feel that I have understood a concept, it is rather important for me to be able to ""see a picture of it in my head"". Now I recognize that for many concepts, this is bluntly impossible--I don't think that I ever will be able to think in 5-dimensional Euclidean space, for instance--but I want to at least be able to get an ""approximate"" or ""cartoony"" or ""conceptually accurate"" illustration in my mind. So for instance, take a fiber bundle. It was introduced to me in one lecture as $(E,B,\pi,F)$ : total space, base space, projection, and fiber, and that was it. As far as the lecturer was concerned, he had given a perfectly reasonable description of what a fiber bundle was. No need to dwell on it further than that. And sure, in a sense, I ""knew"" what a fiber bundle was after that lecture, but I feel that it was first when I got home later that day and googled and started seeing pictures of hairbrushes and Möbius stripes and other things that I actually knew what a fiber bundle was. So, a topic that has long confused me are short exact sequences . When they were first introduced to me, the concept, though straightforward, seemed eminently arbitrary: the image of one map is the kernel of the next. Why is that interesting? Sure, from differential geometry and what little algebraic topology I knew at the time, I was aware of that such sequences of structures and maps between them frequently occurred in mathematics, but I could not see why they were interesting structures in and of themselves . What was the concept that they encoded? I feel that my understanding is much better now, having had a look at some questions posted by other Stack Exchange users with the same stumbling block as me, such as What are exact sequences, metaphysically speaking? and Intuitive meaning of Exact Sequence . Nevertheless, I am still not 100% certain, and so I am posting this question in the same vein to see with more knowledgeable users if this understanding is correct: A way I've heard short exact sequences explained by many people is that they are meant to give an illustration of structures that are ""almost product spaces"", in the sense that $$0 \rightarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow 0$$ along with the trivial $$0 \rightarrow A \rightarrow A \oplus C \rightarrow C \rightarrow 0$$ implies that $B$ is ""almost"" $A \oplus C$ . This makes me wonder, is it fair to think of short exact sequences as ""generalized fiber bundles"", or fiber bundles where the ""spaces"" are groups, rings, modules, etc., akin to how the Möbius stripe is ""almost"" a cylinder?

It includes the familiar definitions of Riemann and Lebesgue, the less familiar but still well known Stieltjes integrals, and quite unfamiliar (but cool) definitions like the Henstock–Kurzweil integral and the Khinchin integral . Now my background is in physics, where we have another kind of integration called path integral (or functional integration ), which remains generally ill-defined despite many decades of fruitful use in theoretical physics.  Naturally, one of my first thoughts upon discovering the exotic integrals in the aforementioned Wikipedia pages (like Henstock–Kurzweil) was whether they could help give rigorous definition to physicists' path integrals, but unfortunately it doesn't look like that's the case. Thinking about all these different sorts of integrals got me to wondering: What are the common features of all these different sorts of integrals that make them ""integrals""? In other words, what are the minimal requirements for some mathematical definition to be an integral?  If I had to guess, I would say the following is a plausible, though imprecise, start: Given a vector space of functions $V$ , a definite integral $\int$ on this space is a function from a subspace $I\subseteq V$ of ""integrable functions"" to a number field $F$ , such that: $\int$ is linear. $\int$ agrees with our intuition for certain simple functions.  In finite dimensions, this could be e.g. that $\int$ applied to the indicator function of a cube is the volume of the cube.  In infinite dimensions, you might prefer to work with Gaussians instead of indicator functions of cubes. I would be tempted to add some condition about continuity, but I'm not sure that would be appropriate in infinite dimensions (i.e. $\int$ might be unbounded?). 
 I wonder if anyone has tried to define integrals in the abstract along these lines, or if these conditions are roughly the minimal ""common features"" of all integrals?","['integration', 'definition', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

3496408,Complex series - convergence criteria,"I am doing Apostol sections concerning series/sequences. In all his statements of tests, like ratio and root tests, it is mentioned that the tested series are non-negative, which automatically precludes the use of these tests for the complex series, since complex numbers cannot be non-negative. However, in Wiki, it is mentioned that the root and ratio tests are actually used with the complex series too. Moreover, some of Apostol exercises are not easily solvable without using these tests with the complex series. But how does it work? Both the root and ratio tests are based on the comparison with the geometric series. In order to use the root test, we first need to take the absolute value of the complex sequence, because the limit has to be compared to 1, which is a real number. Thus, even if the root test shows that the convergence, it only shows the absolute convergence! It says nothing about conditional convergence. An example from Apostol: $\sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty (1 + \frac{1}{n})^{n^2} z^n, z \in \mathcal{C}$ By the root test we get: $|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}} = (1 + \frac{1}{n})^n |z| = e|z|$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ Now, we can see for which values of $z$ the series converges. If $|z| < 1/e$ , then the series converges absolutely . If $|z| > 1/e$ , the series diverges, if $|z| = 1$ , the result is inconclusive. By saying the series diverges in the case $|z| > 1/e$ , why? To me, it says that the series does not converge absolutely ( absolutely diverges ?), however, it does not say if the series can still converge conditionally if $z > 1/e$ . Moreover, is it valid to test the above series without the modulus operation? So that $a^{\frac{1}{n}} = ez, n \rightarrow \infty$ .

I thought this was an interesting class of function to analyze, but didn’t get anywhere- I may simply not have the tools necessary. I call it drunken periodic not to insult the student who made the mistake, but only because I find that name amusing.","['quasiperiodic-function', 'periodic-functions', 'functions']"

3496618,Can there be a geometry where angles can be infinite?,"In Euclidean (and and Riemanian) geometry an angle can be from $0$ to $2\pi$ . The distance in Euclidean geometry is not limited. In spherical geometry the angles are limited as well, but the distance is also limited. I wonder, can there be a geometry where the angles can be unlimited at any point while the length is limited (or not, I am interested in the both cases). I think such geometry would not be locally Euclidean? What would be other properties?","['trigonometry', 'angle', 'geometry', 'riemannian-geometry']"
3496634,Asymptotic Distribution of Order Statistic for a uniform random variable,"I am trying to find the asymptotic distribution of an order statistic $X_{(n)}$ for  iid RVs $X_1, ..., X_n \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0,a)$ , where $a>0$ . The distribution for $X_{(n)}$ $$f(X_{(n)}=x) = \frac{nx^{n-1}}{a^n}I(0<x<a)$$ My gut reaction was to find the limit as $n\rightarrow \infty$ of the CDF, and see if this resembled another distribution.  This gave me $$\frac{x^n}{a^n}$$ My guess is there is a trick or a property I am forgetting.  Note: the actual problem was more involved, I simplified it to just include the component I unsure about.","['probability-limit-theorems', 'uniform-distribution', 'order-statistics', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"
3496698,How to derive this series,"The function $\dfrac1{1-x}$ , equal to $$1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots,$$ can also be developed according to the series $$1 + \frac{x}{1 + x} + \frac{1\cdot2\cdot x^2}{(1 + x)(1 + 2x)} + \frac{1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot x^3}{(1 + x)(1 + 2x)(1 + 3x)} + \cdots $$ when $x$ is positive and smaller than $1$ . I know the first series and it is easy to obtain it. But the second series is strange. It is not a power series, not a Taylor series. How does one obtain this series?","['calculus', 'taylor-expansion', 'sequences-and-series']"
3496701,Is there any rigorous treatment of Markov Decision Process?,"I am trying to find a mathematically rigorous introduction to MDP. There are tons of resouces online but all of them are ... frankly terrible (and not even properly typesetted). Just picking a few: top three links Google returns for ""MDP tutorials"" https://engineering.purdue.edu/~givan/talks/mdp-tutorial.pdf http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./awm/tutorials/mdp09.pdf https://hub.packtpub.com/reinforcement-learning-mdp-markov-decision-process-tutorial/ I don't know why, but they all read something like: A MDP is a tuple $(S,A,R,P)$ (sometimes $(S,A,R,P,\pi)$ , or $(S,A,R,P,\pi,\gamma)$ or $(S,A,R,P,\pi,\gamma, T)$ ) where $S$ is a set of states, $A$ is a set of
  action, $R$ is (depending on who the author is) a determinstic function, a set containing a finite set of values, or a probability distribution over the
  action and the states, $P$ is a conditional probability or sometimes
  conditional probability distribution. In addition, almost all of the references use different notations (various subscripts and superscripts will be added) and have different assumptions and they are all called MDP. I just want one standard reference that eliminates all these ambiguities and conflicting definitions.","['statistics', 'reference-request', 'machine-learning', 'markov-process', 'probability-theory']"
3496714,Deriving a particular form of Stirling's Approximation of the Gamma function?,"I am working from some notes concerning bounds on Dedekind zeta functions and am trying to derive a supposed version of Stirling's approximation contained therein: Let $\sigma$ be fixed and $|t|\rightarrow \infty$ , then a version of Stirling's approximation formula yields $$|\Gamma(\sigma+it)| \sim |t|^{\sigma-\tfrac{1}{2}}e^{-\tfrac{\pi}{2}|t|}\ll |t|^{\sigma-\tfrac{1}{2}}e^{-|t|}$$ where we define $$f(z)\ll g(z) \text{ iff } \exists c\in \mathbb{R}: \exists z_0\in \mathbb{C}: \forall |z|>|z_0|: |f(z)|<c|g(z)|$$ I started working from what appears to be the standard rendering of Stirling: $$\Gamma(s)=\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}s^{s-\frac{1}{2}}}{e^s}\big(1+O(\tfrac{1}{s})\big) \qquad \underset{\text{Since }O\big(\tfrac{1}{s}\big)\ll \tfrac{1}{s} \text{ by definition}}{\Rightarrow} \qquad \Gamma(s)\ll \Big|\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}s^{s-\frac{1}{2}}}{e^s}\Big|\cdot (1+|\tfrac{1}{s}|)$$ But making the relevant substitutions, shuffling things around, and ignoring the negligible contribution of $\sigma$ to the modulus when applicable, I have only been able to find $$|\Gamma(\sigma+it)|\ll |t|^{\sigma-\tfrac{1}{2}}+|t|^{\sigma-\tfrac{3}{2}}$$","['complex-analysis', 'approximation', 'upper-lower-bounds', 'gamma-function']"
3496752,Extension of binary classification to multi-class classification,"Multi-class classification is a generalization of logistic regression wherein we are dealing with binary classification. The latter problem is a setting where a number should be mapped to either $0$ or $1$ . Hence, Logistic regression needs to convert the output of a neural network ( $\hat{y}$ ) to to either $0$ or $1$ to decide. Therefore it use the sigmoid function defined as $$\sigma(\hat{y})=\frac{e^\hat{y}}{1+ e^\hat{y}}\tag{1}$$ where $\hat{y} \in \mathbb{R}$ is the output of the network. On the other hand, Multi-class classification uses the softmax function to decide which is defined as $$\text{softmax}(\hat{\textbf{y}})=\frac{e^{\hat{\textbf{y}}_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{\hat{\textbf{y}}_i}}\tag{2}$$ where $\hat{\textbf{y}} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the output of the network. Question : How can we can play with $(1)$ to get $(2)$ algebraically or vice versa? If we start with $(1)$ how one can get rid of $1$ in denominator? or if we start with $(2)$ how we can generate $1$ in the denominator where $n=2$ .","['machine-learning', 'statistics', 'probability']"
