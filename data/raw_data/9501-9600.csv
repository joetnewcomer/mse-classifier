72247,Question about a recursively defined function,"Problem. Let $(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of functions $f_n\colon [-1,\infty)^n\to\mathbb{R}$ that are recursively defined in the following way: $$f_1(x_1)=1+x_1,$$ $$f_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \begin{cases} (1+x_n)f_{n-1}(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}) & \text{if } f_{n-1}(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}) \le 1, \\ x_n + f_{n-1}(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}) & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}$$ Let $(g_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of functions $g_n\colon [-1,\infty)^n\to\mathbb{R}$ that are defined in the following way: $$g_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \prod_{k=1}^n (1+x_k).$$ Show, for any $n\ge1$ and any $x_1,\ldots,x_n\in[-1,\infty)$, that if $f_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n) <1$, it also holds that $g_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \le1$. Observations. I have tried doing this with induction, but that doesn’t seem to work. It appears that I need more intricate knowledge of the relationship between $f_n$ and $g_n$ in order to solve the problem. Clearly, both are multivariate polynomials. It also seems like all the terms in $f_n$ are also contained in $g_n$, but I don’t know how that could help. Real-life motivation. Note that the quantity $g_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is nothing but 1 dollar that has been invested in $n$ different ventures with percentage returns (positive or negative) of $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, where the profits from each venture have been reinvested in the next venture . The quantity $f_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is similar, except that profits are not reinvested. The objective is to show that if investing in ventures without reinvesting profits results in a loss, then reinvesting the profits couldn’t possibly have resulted in a profit.","['induction', 'functions', 'polynomials']"
72261,A question about direct sums and products of modules,"I'm reading about tensor products of modules and I don't understand the following paragraph on page 2: Even though elements of $M \times N$ and $M \oplus N$ are written in the same way, as pairs $(m, n)$, bilinear functions $M \times N \rightarrow P$ should not be confused with linear functions $M \oplus N \rightarrow P $. For example, addition as a function $ R \oplus R \rightarrow R $ is linear, but as a function $R \times R \rightarrow R$ it is not bilinear. Multiplication as a function $R \times R \rightarrow R$ is bilinear, but as a function $R \oplus R \rightarrow R$ it is not linear. Linear functions are generalized additions and bilinear functions are generalized multiplications. My questions are: Why the distinction between $\times$ and $\oplus$? Aren't they the same for finite sums (products)? I don't understand how addition can be linear but not bilinear. Surely, if $(a,b) \mapsto a + b$ then it doesn't matter in which argument it is linear. (Thinking of e.g. $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$) And if $(a,b) \mapsto ab$ then how can it be linear in both arguments (bilinear) but not be in one (linear). It's difficult to write this sentence as it makes no sense to me whatsoever. Many thanks for your help!","['modules', 'abstract-algebra']"
72273,Integers with square-related properties,"For the sake of convenience, let's define an integer to be a ""supersquare"" if: The number itself is a positive square number Each digit of the number is a positive square (1, 4, 9) The sum of digits is a square For example, 144 is a supersquare because: $144=12^{2}$ Each digit is a positive square (1, 4 and 4) $1+4+4=9=3^{2}$ Here are the first few supersquares that I could find: 1, 4, 9, 144, 441, 44944 Now I'd like to ask: Are there infinite supersquares? If we allow ""almost supersquares"" to have exactly one 0, for example, $9941409=3153^2$, are there infinite almost supersquares? (allowing for two 0s is trivial, because multiplying a supersquare by powers of 100 will give the required integers, e.g. 4494400, 449440000, etc.) Unfortunately, motivation is out of my own personal curiosity and because of that I have little idea as to how to approach the problem. However, a quick check with Python for integers below $10^{14}$ has found 44944 to be the highest supersquare so far, and 4410449411449 to be the highest almost supersquare. Edit: After searching through integers below $10^{18}$ the highest supersquare is still 44944, but here is the sequence of almost supersquares: 9941409, 141111419904, 941911011441, 1119444409444, 1144944940441, 4410449411449, 4991441999419044, 49041994144141441, 141114911949411904, ...",['number-theory']

So $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}) \otimes_\mathbb{Z} (\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z})$ has the basis $\{ 1 \otimes 1 \}$. Therefore, any element in $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}) \otimes_\mathbb{Z} (\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z})$  is of the form $(ab) 1 \otimes 1$ and any element in $\mathbb{Z}/ \gcd(m,n)\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form $k 1 = k$ where $k \in \{ 0, \dots , \gcd(n,m) \}$. I would like to construct an isomorphism that maps $ab$ to some $k$. Let this map be $ab (1 \otimes 1) \mapsto ab \bmod \gcd(n,m)$. This is a homomorphism between modules: it maps $0$ to $0$ because it maps the empty sum to the empty sum. It also fulfills $f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)$ because there is only one element, $a = 1$. It is surjective. So all I need to show is that it is injective. But that is clear too because if $ab \equiv 0 \bmod \gcd(m,n)$  then both $a \equiv 0 \bmod n$ and $b \equiv 0 \bmod m$ so the kernel is trivial.

72317,A resemblance between 2 binomial identities - why?,"Let $F$ be any field (or even ring). The following formal power series identity (i.e., equality in $F[[x]]$) holds for any $j \ge 0$: $$(1-x)^{-j} = \sum_{i \ge 0} \binom{i +j -1}{i} x^i $$ The other identity is the following: let $F_{p}$ be a finite field with $p$ elements. The following holds for each $1 \neq x \in F_{p}$: $$(1-x)^{-j} = \sum_{i \ge 0}^{p-1} \binom{i +j }{i} x^i$$ Are the identities equivalent or related in some way? I feel that the first identity is more formal and concerns equality of coefficients (after multiplying both sides by $(1-x)^j$), yet the second identity is not only formal: $x$ can be plugged in and both sides give an element in the field. Any insights are welcome - I'm not sure what I'm expecting. Context: I've encountered the first identity - which is quite useful - while studying generating functions.

72459,Do I understand complex differentiability correctly?,"I don't use complex analysis much in my ""day job"", but I'm perusing the materials for personal interest. I just wanted to check with the community about my understanding of complex analytic (holomorphic) functions, and why they are ""special"" compared to real-valued functions. A far as I understood it, the definition of a complex holomorphic function is a consequence of the fact that complex numbers essentially live in $\mathbb{R}^2$ but has a funny definition of algebraic multiplication $(x_1,y_1)(x_2,y_2) = (x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2, x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1)$ that makes it useful for defining roots of negative numbers, while at the same time still acting like real numbers when the $y$ component is zero. Complex functions, since they can essentially be mapped to something that's $f:\mathbb R^2 \rightarrow \mathbb R^2$, have by definition derivatives that are Frechet derivatives ($2 \times 2$ linear operators in this case). However, the derivative also need to act like a single complex number, so the $2 \times 2$ linear operator needs to act like multiplication by a complex number. By the definition of complex products above, this means there are special restrictions on the matrix elements of this operator. And by extension of the fact that Frechet derivatives is just a matrix of partial derivatives, special relationships exist between the partial derivatives. Quite a bit down the road, this essentially leads to the consequences laid out in the Cauchy Integral Theorem. Is that correct? TLDR: the definition of complex number products, along with their $\mathbb R^2$ nature, leads to the definition of holomorphic functions and the Cauchy Integral Theorem. Correct?","['complex-numbers', 'complex-analysis', 'analysis']"

72508,An inequality in the proof of characterization of the $H^{-1}$ norm in Evans's PDE book,"I'm reading through the Sobolev Spaces section in Evans's Partial Differential Equations book, and I was stuck on a theorem characterizing the $H^{-1}$ norm. On page 299 Theorem 1 (in the second edition), he proves that for $f \in H^{-1}(U)$,
$$\begin{multline}\|f\|_{H^{-1}(U)} = \inf \Big\{ \left( \int_U \sum_{i=0}^n |f^i|^2 dx \right): \langle f, v \rangle = \int_U f^0 v + \sum_{i=1}^n f^i v_{x_i} dx,\\ \;f^0,\ldots,f^n \in L^2(U), \; \forall v \in H^1(U)\Big\}.
\end{multline}$$ Here $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes the dual pairing of $H^{-1}$ and $H_0^1$. To show this, he first states that given $f \in H^{-1}(U)$, we can apply to the Riesz Representation Theorem to get an element $u \in H_0^1$ such that $(u,v)_{H_0^1} = \langle f,v \rangle \; \forall v \in H_0^1$, where $(u,v)_{H_0^1} = \int Du \cdot Dv + uv dx$ is an inner product on $H_0^1$. Then we can define $f^0=u$ and $f^i = u_{x_i}$ for each $i$. Now, if $\langle f, v \rangle = \int_U g^0 v + \sum_{i=1}^n g^i v_{x_i} dx$, for $g^0,\ldots,g^n \in L^2(U)$, then by choosing $v=u$, we can see that 
$$\int_U |Du|^2 +|u|^2 dx \leq \int_U \sum_{i=0}^n |g^i|^2 dx.$$ How does he get this inequality? When you let $v=u$, you get
$$\int_U |Du|^2 +|u|^2 dx = \int_U g^0 u + \sum_{i=1}^n g^i u_{x_i} dx$$

72572,Natural Euclidean Function Not Satisfying the $d$-inequality,"Let me provide some background before I begin (although I feel as though it's hardly needed): Let $R$ be an integral domain. I call a function $d:R\setminus \{0\}\to\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ a Euclidean function if for every $a,b\in R$ , $a\ne0$ , there exists $q,r\in R$ with $b=aq+r$ and 
  either $r=0$ or $d(r)<d(a)$ . I say that a Euclidean function satisfies the $d$ -inequality if $x\mid y$ implies $d(x)\leqslant d(y)$ . It is often assumed that Euclidean functions for example, in the context of Euclidean domains, always satisfy the $d$ -inequality since
given a Euclidean function $d$ the function $\displaystyle \widetilde{d}(x)=\min_{y\ne 0}d(xy)$ is a Euclidean function satisfying the $d$ -inequality. Thus, Euclidean domains (i.e. rings for which there exists a Euclidean function on) are precisely the same as the rings that admit Euclidean functions satisfying the $d$ -inequality. Now, while, as I said above, the study of such rings (where the only key is the existence of such functions) is no different, practically it's much nicer to have Euclidean functions satisfying the $d$ -inequality since they enjoy such benefits as $a\in R^\times$ if and only if $d(a)=d(1)$ . The strange thing is, most naturally occurring Euclidean functions satisfy the $d$ -inequality (e.g. the degree function on $F[x]$ , field norms, etc.) And, for the life of me, I can't think of a non-contrived example of a Euclidean function that does not satisfy the $d$ -inequality. So, what are some? Moreover, there will undoubtedly be some trivial, common one that I've overlooked, then I would still love to hear more obscure ones that arise naturally in more advanced contexts.

72646,"Help me put these enormous numbers in order:  googol, googol-plex-bang, googol-stack and so on","Popular mathematics folklore provides some simple tools
enabling us compactly to describe some truly enormous
numbers. For example, the number $10^{100}$ is commonly
known as a googol ,
and a googol
plex is
$10^{10^{100}}$. For any number $x$, we have the common
vernacular: $x$ bang is the factorial number $x!$ $x$ plex is the exponential number $10^x$ $x$ stack is the number obtained by iterated exponentiation
 (associated upwards) in a tower of height $x$, also denoted $10\uparrow\uparrow x$,
$$10\uparrow\uparrow x = 10^{10^{10^{\cdot^{\cdot^{10}}}}}{\large\rbrace} x\text{ times}.$$ Thus, a googol bang is $(10^{100})!$, and a googol stack is
$10\uparrow\uparrow 10^{100}$. The vocabulary enables us to
name larger numbers with ease: googol bang plex stack.  (This is the exponential tower $10^{10^{\cdot^{\cdot^{^{10}}}}}$ of height $10^{(10^{100})!}$) googol stack bang stack bang googol bang bang stack plex stack and so onâ€¦ Consider the collection of all numbers that can be named in
this scheme, by a term starting with googol and having
finitely many adjectival operands: bang, stack, plex, in
any finite pattern, repetitions allowed. (For the purposes
of this question, let us limit ourselves to these three
operations and please accept the base 10 presumption of the
stack and plex terminology simply as an artifact of its
origin in popular mathematics.) My goal is to sort all such numbers nameable in this
vocabulary by size. A few simple observations get us started. Once $x$ is large
enough (about 20), then the factors of $x!$ above $10$
compensate for the few below $10$, and so we see that
$10^x\lt x!$, or in other words, $x$ plex is less than $x$
bang. Similarly, $10^{10^{:^{10}}}x$ times is much larger
than $x!$, since $10^y\gt (y+1)y$ for large $y$, and so for
large values we have $x$ plex $\lt$ $x$ bang $\lt$ $x$ stack. In particular, the order for names having at most one
adjective is: googol
 googol plex
 googol bang
 googol stack And more generally, replacing plex with bang or bang with
stack in any of our names results in a strictly (and much)
larger number. Continuing, since $x$ stack plex $= (x+1)$ stack, it
follows that $x$ stack plex $\lt x$ plex stack. Similarly, for large values, $x$ plex bang $\lt x$ bang plex, because $(10^x)!\lt (10^x)^{10^x}=10^{x10^x}\lt 10^{x!}$.
Also, $x$ stack bang $\lt x$ plex stack $\lt x$ bang stack, because $(10\uparrow\uparrow x)!\lt (10\uparrow\uparrow
x)^{10\uparrow\uparrow x}\lt 10\uparrow\uparrow 2x\lt
10\uparrow\uparrow 10^x\lt 10\uparrow\uparrow x!$. It also
appears to be true for large values that $x$ bang bang $\lt x$ stack. Indeed, one may subsume many more iterations of plex and
bang into a single stack. Note also for large values that $x$ bang $\lt x$ plex plex since $x!\lt x^x$, and this is seen to be less than
$10^{10^x}$ by taking logarithms. The observations above enable us to form the following
order of all names using at most two adjectives. googol
 googol plex
 googol bang
 googol plex plex
 googol plex bang
 googol bang plex
 googol bang bang
 googol stack
 googol stack plex
 googol stack bang
 googol plex stack
 googol bang stack
 googol stack stack My request is for any or all of the following: Expand the list above to include numbers named using
more than two adjectives. (This will not be an
end-extension of the current list, since googol plex plex
plex and googol bang bang bang will still appear before
googol stack.) If people post partial progress, we can
assemble them into a master list later. Provide general comparison criteria that will assist
such an on-going effort. Provide a complete comparison algorithm that works for
any two expressions having the same number of adjectives. Provide a complete comparison algorithm that compares
any two expressions. Of course, there is in principle a computable comparison
procedure, since we may program a Turing machine to
actually compute the two values and compare their size.
What is desired, however, is a simple, feasible algorithm.

algorithm that would compare any two names in polynomial

What happens if I consider instead $ \mathbf{Proj}\left ( \mathrm{Sym}(\mathcal{I} ) \right )$? Is this a related object, and what's its geometric interpretation?

Prove that the derivative of an odd (resp. even) function, when exists, is even (resp. odd) Since the graph is symmetric with respect to the origin, the slopes of the tangent lines at $x=a$ and $x=-a$ must equal, hence the derivative is even. Similarly for the even function. 2. If $f$ is one-one and continuous, then $f^{-1}$ is also continuous. This can't be more obvious. $f^{-1}$ is just the reflection of $f$ about the line $y=x$ . 3. $\displaystyle\int_a^bf(x)dx+\int_b^cf(x)dx=\int_a^cf(x)dx$ The sum of the area from $a$ to $b$ and the area from $b$ to $c$ is, of course, the area from $a$ to $c$ . 4. If $f$ is a one-one function one $[a,b]$ , then $\displaystyle\int_a^bf(x)dx+\int_{f(a)}^{f(b)}f^{-1}(x)dx=bf(b)-af(a).$ Quite clear if you draw a diagram. The sum of the two integrals is the difference of two rectangles. 5. If $f$ is increasing and $f(0)=0$ , then for $a,b>0$ we have $\displaystyle\int_0^af(a)dx+\int_0^bf^{-1}(x)dx\ge ab$ . Also clear from the diagram. There's a ""leftover"" part outside the rectangle of area $ab$ . Of course, these proofs are not rigorous, and possibly not valid at all. Firstly, I only consider the easy cases. Secondly, I used the intuitive properties of geometric objects without proofs. So I'm wondering, is there any theory that connects calculus with geometry rigorously? Such a theory would help simplify calculus proofs tremendously, as I roughly outlined above.","['geometry', 'calculus']"

I have no problems showing that the vector field is complete. However, it's the flow part that bugs me. So far I've tried the following: 
Look at $h(s,t,p) = \phi_{X,t}\circ \phi_{Y,s}(p)$, for some point p. Set $c(t,p) = h(t,t,p)$. We then have, after differentiating that $\frac{d}{dt}_{t=0}c(t,p) = D_1h(0,0,p)+D_2h(0,0,p)$.Since $h(t,0,p)=\phi_{t,x}(p)$ and $h(0,t,p) = \phi_{t,Y}(p)$ we get that $D_1h(0,0,p) = X(p)$, and $D_2h(0,0,p) = Y(p)$ and thus, the flow is $X(p)+Y(p)$.",['differential-geometry']

72913,"Are measurable functions closed under addition and multiplication, but not composition?","The statement ""Measurable functions are closed under addition and multiplication, but not composition."" was generated by Wolfram Alpha from a source of mixed quality by turning all references (and hyperlinks) from the original text into a ""related topics"" section with no connection to the main text. I have two questions related to this: Is automatic removal of references from a mathematical text (as done by Wolfram Alpha) an ""invalid"" text transformation? For example, if I write a text, do I have to take care that it won't change its meaning dramatically if all references are ""silently"" removed? (Checking my last publication, I realized that some sentences in it would also ""break"" if the references would be ""silently"" removed.) Should Wolfram Research fix this ""automatism""? Is there something wrong (or evil ) with the ""subsets of sets with measure zero"" modification that make it especially ""fragile"" with respect to minor inaccuracies? Isn't such a ""fragile"" concept difficult to remember correctly, and hence would require a really good justification by a corresponding significant benefit with respect to more ""canonical"" concepts? Context (original question) In theory, I think the ideas behind Wolfram Alpha are very worthwhile. In practice, google seems to be good enough for me. But now I tried to use Wolfram Alpha for my math questions. It was surprisingly good at understanding my questions. Most answers were disappointingly ""shallow"", but not wrong. However, the answer to measurable function deeply worries me: ... When $X=\mathbb{R}$ with Lebesgue measure, or more generally any Borel measure, then all continuous functions are measurable. In fact, practically any function that can be described is measurable. Measurable functions are closed under addition and multiplication, but not composition. Both the statement that the Lebesgue measure is a Borel measure and the statement that measurable functions are not closed under composition are seriously misleading for me. (I had to read the Wikipedia article to reassure me that my current understanding wasn't completely wrong). You may object that I quoted this out of context, but the removal of context done by Wolfram Alpha is exactly what worries me. The original article from MathWorld certainly wasn't great, but the removal of the hyperlinks and references by Wolfram Alpha really killed it. However, this also made me think about the usefulness of the ""subsets of sets with measure zero"" modification to the Borel measurable sets. Is there any good practical reason that justifies the confusion created by the difference between ""Lebesgue measurable"" and ""Borel measurable""? Are there any practically relevant functions that are ""Lebesgue measurable"" but not ""Borel measurable""?","['measure-theory', 'math-software']"
