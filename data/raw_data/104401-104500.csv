1468484,Under what conditions can a collection of sets be turned into a pairwise disjoint collection of sets?,"I am looking at the construction of the Lebesgue measure, and the following doubt came up. When defining the outer Lebesgue measure, we let
$$m\left(\bigcup_{k \in \mathcal{K}}I_k\right) = \sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}} m(I_k)$$
for any countable pairwise disjoint collection of intervals $\{I_k \mid k \in \mathcal{K}\}$, thus satisfying the countable additivity requirement. Now I want to argue that this definition also works for any countable collection of intervals, not just pairwise disjoint ones. My understanding is that the standard construction is the following. Given a countable collection $\mathcal{A} = \{A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots\}$, we can construct $\mathcal{B} = \{B_1, B_2, B_3, \dots\}$ by
$$B_n = A_n \cap \left(\bigcap^{n - 1}_{i = 1} (A_i)^c\right).$$
Then we have $\bigcup_i A_i = \bigcup_i B_i$.
So back to the outer measure, if we have a countable collection $\mathcal{I}$ of intervals, then we can use the previous procedure to construct a countable pairwise disjoint collection $\mathcal{I}'$ such that
$$m\left(\bigcup \mathcal{I}\right) = m\left(\bigcup \mathcal{I}'\right).$$ My question is whether my understanding of this is correct, and under which conditions the construction holds. I guess we have to have closure under intersection for the construction to hold, but is there anything else?","['lebesgue-measure', 'elementary-set-theory']"

1468538,Exterior Derivative in overlapping charts,"Given a smooth manifold $M$, say of dimension $n$ and two charts $ (U,x)$ & $ (V,y)$, I want to prove that if $U \cap V \neq \emptyset $, then the exterior derivatives $d_x$ and $d_y$ coincide in $ U \cap V$.

If $\alpha$ is an exact form, then $\alpha = d\beta$ for some differential form $\beta$. The exterior derivative $d$ satisfies that $d \circ d = 0$, so $d_x\alpha = d_y\alpha = d \circ d \beta = 0 $.

1468650,Clarification about the definition of Calabi-Yau manifold,"There are a lot of different definitions of a Calabi-Yau manifold. Roughly, we can divide them in two sets, see Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold . I will refer to this link for notations and everything else. Wikipedia says that when $M$ is simply-connected, these two definitions are equivalent. But if $M$ is only connected, then we have that the first one implies the second one but not the vice versa. I agree with both the statements. My problem is the following. Suppose that $M$ is not simply-connected and the holonomy group $Hol(M)$ is contained in $SU(n)$ (here $n$ is the complex dimension of $M$). By the holomy principle there exists a parallel $n$-form, i.e. a parallel section of the canonical bundle $K_M=\Omega_M^n$. In particular this implies that $K_M$ is flat and since the curvature of $K_M$ is proportional to the Ricci tensor of $M$, we get that $M$ is Ricci-flat. According to Wikipedia, $M$ is Ricci-flat if and only if $c_1(M)=0$. So we are leading to say that $Hol(M)\subset SU(n)$ if and only if $c_1(M)=0$. But Wikipedia itself says that this double implication is not true when $M$ is not simply-connected. I am stuck in front of this absurd. Can someone please point out where my argument fails and why? Thank you in advance! EDIT: I think to have solved my problem(s) now. 1) first of all I was wrong because Wikipedia talks about local holonomy and not restricted holonomy (for which the holonomy principle doesn't hold); 2) if $Hol(M)\subset SU(n)$ I conclude that $M$ is Ricci-flat, but the vice versa is not true in general because of the following: if $K_M$ is flat I claimed that there exists a parallel section; but what happens if the bundle has no sections? We cannot go the other direction. This is for example the case of an Enrique surface. 3) in the non simply-connected case, I can run my argument on the universal cover of $M$, which is simply-connected and hence everything works well. After that I can push-down the result and see what happens. In the case the holonomy is contained inside $SU(n)$ we can still state that the canonical bundle is trivial, but it can have non trivial curvature.","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'kahler-manifolds', 'holonomy']"

for any $\theta \in [0,2 \pi)$

\lim_{r \rightarrow 0} f(r e^{i \theta}) = a,

where $r$ is a positive real number. In other terms, all the radial limits of $f$ in $0$ exist and are equal. Does there exist the limit of $f$ in $0$?
Clearly, if we suppose that $f$ is bounded in a neighborhood of $0$, then a well known result states that $f$ is holomorphic in $U$, so the answer is yes. The only interesting case is so that of a function $f$ which is unbounded in any neighborhood of $0$.

Some of my friends tell me lots of facts about these and define several structures and invariants, but I feel like the logical sequence of facts and some motivation for definitions are missing. Some questions I have (among a lot of others): For example, I would really like to know more about the Decomposition Group and the Inertia Group of an ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ over $\mathfrak{p}$. I get the definitions but it is not really clear if these groups are simply subgroups of the Galois group that have arithmetic information encoded in them or if they really help computationally to find some invariants (e,f,g) which would be hard to find without them. Again about the Decomposition and Inertia Groups; It is clear that we are interested in the Decomposition group because we want to find the ideals that get fixed (not pointwise, I know) by the automorphisms of the Galois group. However, It is not clear why would we look at the automorphisms which induce the identity in the quotient ($B/\mathfrak{q})/(A/\mathfrak{p}$) (the elements of the Inertia Group).

1469132,Only two parts left : Problem on Fourier Transform and convergence of Tempered Distributions,"I recently met this problem from Folland's real analysis second edition involving a specific question on distributions (exercise 19 page 299) which reads as follows: On $ R $ let $ F_0 = PV(\frac{1}{x}) $ where PV stands for ""Principle Value"" and defined as follows: $ \langle PV(f),\phi\rangle = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \int_{|x|>\epsilon} f(x)\phi(x) \, dx $ for all $ \phi \in C_C^\infty $ . Also for $ \epsilon > 0 $ we define $ F_\epsilon(x) = x(x^2+\epsilon^2)^{-1} $ , $ G_\epsilon^\pm(x)=(x \pm i\epsilon)^{-1} $ and $ S_\epsilon(x) = \operatorname{sgn}(x) e^{-2 \pi \epsilon |x|} $ a. We are to prove $ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} F_\epsilon=F_0 $ in the weak topology* on $ \mathcal{S}' $ (distributions on Schwartz class of functions where we define the weak topology in the usual point-wise convergence sense). As hint we are told to use the theorem below the question with a=0. b. We are to prove that $ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} G_\epsilon^\pm = F_0 \mp i \pi \delta $ (Hint : $(x \pm i\epsilon )^{-1} = (x \mp i\epsilon)(x^2+\epsilon ^2)^{-1} $ ). c. We are to prove that $ \widehat{S}_\epsilon = (i\pi)^{-1} F_\epsilon $ and hence $ \widehat{\operatorname{sgn}} = (i\pi)^{-1}F_0 $ . d. From part c it follows that $ \widehat{F}_0 = -i\pi \operatorname{sgn} $ . We are to prove this directly by showing $ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0 , N \to \infty } H_{\epsilon,N} = F_0 $ where we define $ H_{\epsilon,N} $ to be $ \frac{1}{x} $ if $ \epsilon < |x| < N $ and 0 otherwise, and via the exercise at the bottom. e. We are to compute $ \widehat{\chi}_{(0,\infty)} $ (i) By writing $\chi = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{sgn} + \frac{1}{2} $ and by using part c (ii) By using $ \chi(x) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} e^{-x\epsilon} \chi_{(0,\infty )} $ and by using b.

1469159,Does this extension of the Collatz sequence converge for n=550?,"The Collatz function , or $3n + 1$ function is well known. A heuristic argument that most inputs should converge with repeated application of the function is as follows. With probability 1/2 an input $n$ will be either even or odd. If it is even, it will be multiplied by a factor of 1/2. If it is odd, it will be multiplied by a factor of roughly 3, and then divided by 2. So on average we would expect the growth rate per two iterations to be $\frac{1}{2}*\frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{4} < 1$. Now consider the following extension to numbers $p$ and $q$. $f(n) =  \begin{cases}
    n/p       & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is divisible by }p\\
    qn \text{ rounded up to the nearest multiple of }p  & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is not divisible by }p\\
  \end{cases}$ We can also express this function as (for ease of computation) $f(n) =  \begin{cases}
    n/p       & \quad \text{if } n \text{ mod }p=0\\
    qn + p - (qn\text{ mod }p)  & \quad \text{otherwise}\\
  \end{cases}$ Then, heuristically we can argue that an input $n$ has a $\frac{1}{p}$ probability to be a multiple of $p$ and hence will be multiplied by $\frac{1}{p}$, and a $\frac{p-1}{p}$ probability to be multiplied by a factor of $\frac{q}{p}$. So the average growth factor we expect after $p$ iterations is $\frac{1}{p}(\frac{q}{p})^{p-1}$. Now consider the case $p=3$, $q=5$. The heuristic growth factor is $\frac{1}{3}(\frac{5}{3})^2 = \frac{25}{27} < 1$, so we predict convergence. Indeed, for every starting $n \leq 549$ the sequence formed by repeated application of $f$ converges to one of two cycles. $4 \rightarrow 21 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 36 \rightarrow 12 \rightarrow 4$ $8 \rightarrow 42 \rightarrow 14 \rightarrow 72 \rightarrow 24 \rightarrow 8$ However, the sequence starting with $n = 550$ eventually overflows the integer arithmetic in Matlab. (~$10^{200}$). Note that the sequence hovers in the $10^{15}$ range for a while before skyrocketing straight to $10^{200}$, so I don't quite trust the computation. Can someone either $(a)$ show that $550$ actually does converge using better numerics or $(b)$ prove that $550$ diverges?","['collatz-conjecture', 'number-theory']"

We see that $\{a_n\}$ is decreasing and has limit $0$ . We have to see now that $$\sup_{N}{\left| \sum_{n=1}^{N}{\cos(nx)} \right|}<\infty.$$ $$\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{N}e^{inx}=\sum_{n=0}^{N}(e^{ix})^{n}= \frac{1-e^{ix(n+1)}}{1-e^{ix}}, \text{if x} \neq 2k\pi. $$ So $${\left| \sum_{n=0}^{N}{\cos(nx)} \right|}={\left| \Re\left(\sum_{n=0}^{N}{e^{inx}}\right) \right|}={\left| \Re\left(\frac{1-e^{ix(N+1)}}{1-e^{ix}}\right) \right|} \leq {\left| \frac{1-e^{ix(N+1)}}{1-e^{ix}} \right|}\leq {\frac{\left|1\right|+\left| e^{i(N+1)x} \right|}{\left|1-e^{{ix}}  \right|}}=\frac{2}{\left|1-e^{{ix}}  \right|}.$$ So, by Dirichlet, if $x\neq 2k\pi$ , the series is convergent. What happens if $x= 2k\pi$ ? $$\displaystyle\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{\cos(n(2k\pi))}{n^\alpha}=\displaystyle\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{n^\alpha}$$ and we know that this series converges when $\alpha>1$ and diverges if $\alpha\leq 1$ .

If on the wings of the windmill $4$ parts are colored black, $3$ parts are colored red, and $3$ parts are colored orange, in how many ways can one then color the windmill? (In different ways when one looks at the windmill from the front and the wings rotate.) Use Pólya's theorem and the fact that the group $C_n$ that consists of rotations of a regular $n$-polygon has the cycle index $$\frac 1n\sum_{d\,|\, n} \varphi(d)t_d^{\frac nd},$$
where $\varphi(d)=\left |\{j\,:\, 0\leq j\leq d-1,\; \textrm{gcd}(j,d)=1\}\right |$, but observe that in this case the number of orbits is double that of a regular $n$-polygon because each wing is built from two parts. Here $\sum_{ d\,|\,n}$ means that we take the sum over all integers $d$ such that $1\leq d\leq n$ and $n$ is divisible by $d$ and the term $t_d^{\frac nd}$ is due to the fact that in the rotation group there is an element so that the cyclic group generated by it has $\frac nd$ orbits with length $d$. Pólya's theorem says that if in the cycle index the variable $t_j$ is replaced by $b^j+r^j+o^j$ then the coefficient of the term $b^4\cdot r^3\cdot o^3$ is the number one is looking for! My attempt: I set $n = 4 + 3 + 3 = 10$ and determined all divisors $d$ of $n$ to be $1,2,5,10$. Now $\varphi (1) = 1,\,\varphi (2) = 1,\,\varphi (5) = 4,\,\varphi (10) = 4$. Plugging into equation i got the cycle index $$\frac{1}{{10}}\left( {t_1^{10} + t_2^5 + 4t_5^2 + 4{t_{10}}} \right)$$ Calculating for $b^4\cdot r^3\cdot o^3$

1469204,Morita equivalent rings have homeomorphic spectra?,"For two unital rings $R,S$, let $R\sim S$ denote that $R$ and $S$ are Morita equivalent , i.e. the categories $\mathrm{Mod}_R$ and $\mathrm{Mod}_S$ are equivalent. Examples include: Matrix rings: $R\sim M_n(R)$ for any $n\geq 1$, Full corners: $R\sim eRe$ whenever $e$ is a full idempotent in $R$, i.e. $e=e^2$ and $ReR=R$. The former is an example of the latter, since $R\simeq \varepsilon_{11}M_n(R)\varepsilon_{11}$ where $\varepsilon_{11}\in M_n(R)$ is the idempotent with $1$ in the $(1,1)$ entry and $0$'s everywhere else. It turns out these are essentially the only ways to construct Morita equivalent rings. Theorem. $R\sim S$ if and only if $S\simeq eM_n(R)e$ for some $n\geq 1$ and some full idempotent $e\in M_n(R)$. If $R$ is a unital ring, a proper ideal $P\subseteq R$ is prime if $IJ\subseteq P$ implies $I\subseteq P$ or $J\subseteq P$ for all ideals $I,J$. Let $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ denote the set of prime ideals of $R$, called the prime spectrum of $R$, with the usual Zariski topology : the closed sets are $$V(I):=\{ P\in\mathrm{Spec}(R) : P\supseteq I\}$$ for $I$ an ideal of $R$. My question is: if $R$ and $S$ are Morita equivalent rings, then is $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ homeomorphic to $\mathrm{Spec}(S)$? I'm also wondering if Morita equivalence determines the poset of ideals. By the above Theorem, we just have to investigate the cases where $S=M_n(R)$ or $S=eRe$. It's not hard to see that $I\mapsto M_n(I)$ is an order-preserving bijection between ideals of $R$ and ideals of $M_n(R)$, which is multiplicative in the sense that $M_n(IJ)=M_n(I)M_n(J)$, and this multiplicativity implies that it takes prime ideals to prime ideals. It's also easily seen to be continuous when restricted to $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$. So we can conclude that $$\mathrm{Spec}(R) \simeq \mathrm{Spec}(M_n(R)).$$ Now how about full corners? If $eRe$ is not full then it's easy to see that it's false: for example $S=\mathbf{Z}$ is a corner of $R=\mathbf{Z}\oplus \mathbf{Z}$ where $e=(1,0)\in R$, and yet $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbf{Z})\not\simeq \mathrm{Spec}(\mathbf{Z}\oplus\mathbf{Z})$. This corner is not full though. Here's my idea: we have a map
$$\Phi:\{\text{ideals of } R\} \rightarrow \{\text{ideals of } eRe\}$$
$$I\longmapsto eIe$$
which is surjective --- a right inverse is given by $\Psi(J):=RJR$. Is $\Phi$ injective if $eRe$ is a full corner? Does $\Phi$ preserve prime ideals? Would it be Zariski-continuous?

Later he makes the remarks that the function $f$ depends on $s_{0}$ as well as $n$ . I didn't quite understand what he means by dependence on $s_0$ ? Does he mean if you get $n^x$ via two sets $S_{s_0}$ and $S_{s_1}$ for two numbers $s_0$ and $s_1$ , then do we get two distinct $p$ -adic numbers? Can I see an example where this happens?

1469294,"Recommendations for an ""illuminating"" (explained in the post) group theory/abstract algebra resource?","I recently asked a question regarding why homomorphisms and isomorphisms are important. The best answer to that question was actually a comment, which referred me to Brian M. Scott's answer here: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/242370/115703 That answer was mind blowingly insightful for me. I finally began to understand why someone would care about homomorphisms, and why the ""kernel"" might actually be called a kernel. Revelation upon revelation. Frisson all over. Why isn't this sort of an explanation easy to find in algebra textbooks though? (I am reading Dummit and Foote, and Rotman) Shouldn't this be the first thing a textbook says. Example: Say we are interested in studying the structure of the odd and even numbers. If we look at it from the perspective of the set $\mathbb{Z}$ , then we are likely to carry on a lot of extra baggage since $\mathbb{Z}$ has more structure in it than just ""odd and even"". What if studied the structure $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ instead? Well, it would be useful then to have some sort of a mapping between $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/\mathbb{2Z}$ , since we are really studying integers, in a ""reduced structure"" setting. What sort of mappings might we be interested in... (ellipsis for a better way to explain the argument between where I have left off, and where I am going to, which eludes me right now) -- so the concept of a homomorphism . However, we might also be interested in asking how a homomorphism between $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ changes/preserves the structure of $\mathbb{Z}$ . For instance, we might be curious about which elements in $\mathbb{Z}$ essentially become the ""same"" in $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ ...--so, the concept of a kernel . On the other hand, which elements retain some sense of ""difference""...--so, the concept of image . An isomorphism is just a homomorphism which preserves detail exactly -- i.e. it doesn't collapse any elements in $\mathbb{Z}$ into the ""same"" element in $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ ..-- which is why its kernel is just the identity . Actually, maybe instead of viewing homomorphisms and isomorphisms as structure preserving maps between groups, we should view them as generators of groups ? i.e. given some group, and we construct something that is a homomorphism in order to explore a new group related to the old group, given that homomorphism ? A lot of what I have written is very ""soft"" and not formally fleshed out. Some parts are outright skipped over (ellipsis) because I still lack the wisdom to explain it well. Regardless, the point is that, when first learning these topics, in order to understand the definitions well, it would be very illuminating to read the ""big picture"" behind all the details that are about to follow. Is there an abstract algebra text that provides this sort of illumination? Ideally, it such a text would also contain all the necessary proofs for formally defining a topic, but perhaps that is asking for too much? Even more ideally, such a text would deal with most of abstract algebra (at least groups, rings and fields), but that might be asking for too much, again. So, perhaps recommendations can be split up into categories depending on which aspect of abstract algebra they tackle in particular.","['big-picture', 'abstract-algebra', 'reference-request', 'soft-question']"

1469636,Two cards are drawn without replacement from an ordinary deck of 52 cards. What is the probability that the cards are of the same suit?,"What is the probability that the cards are of the same suit? This specific type of question deals with the use of combinations and permutations. I know that because the cards aren't being replaced after being taken out, order does matter and therefore permutations are used. So I started off with this: (13)P(2) since at first there are 13 cards of the same suit, then 12 after one of the suit is picked out and not replaced. The total came out to be 156 ways. For the sample space I did (52)P(2) since at first there are 52 cards to choose from, and then there are 51 cards to choose from after the first card is picked and not replaced. The total came out to be 2652 ways. So then to find the probability of the question: (13)P(2)/(52)P(2)= 156/2652= 1/17 What is the probability that the cards are both face cards? I started off with this: There are 12 face cards in total, and because cards aren't being replaced, order does matter. So since there are 12 face cards as choices in the first try, then 11 in the second I did (12)P(2) as the numerator. The total came out to be 132. For the denominator, which is the sample space, I did (52)P(2), since you are choosing 2 out of 52 cards and got 2652 ways. So now I do : (12)P(2)/(52)P(2)= 132/2652= 11/221 What is the probability that the cards are a diamond and a spade? I was a little confused on this one, but I tried. Even though I said order matters and to use permutations, I felt like for the numerator I was supposed to combinations since choosing a diamond and spade didn't matter. Since there are 13 spades and 13 diamonds, for the numerator I did (13)C(1)*(13)C(1) which equals to 169 ways of choosing a diamond and a spade. For the sample space I stayed with (52)P(2) since order still matter on this one which equals to 2652 ways. So the final step is : [(13)C(1)*(13)C(1)]/(52)P(2)= 169/2652= 13/204 I would like to know if I did these questions right, because i'm a little confused between using combinations and permutations.","['combinations', 'probability', 'permutations']"

More importantly, I didn't find any reference for this comparison, so I'm asking for your help. We begin with the definition, taken from [tom Dieck's Algebraic Topology]: Definition 1 [Deformation Retract] A subspace $K \subset X$ is a deformation retract iff $\exists$ an homotopy relative to $K$ $h_t \colon X \to X$ s.t. $h_0=Id_X$ and $h_1 = i\circ r$ , where $i$ is the inclusion $K\subset X$ and $r\colon X \to K$ is the so-called retraction (i.e $r\circ i = Id_K$ ) Definition 2 [ENR] $K$ is a ENR if $\exists \ j \colon K \to \mathbb{R}^n$ , an embedding, and exists an open nbd $U$ of $K':=j(K)$ , and a retraction $r\colon U \to K$ s.t. $j\circ r=Id_{K'}$ To be precise , on [tom Dieck] def. $2$ is stated as above with the only difference that the retraction is required to satisfy $j\circ r = Id(K)$ (page 448) but I don't know what does it mean $Id(K)$ and the domain of $r$ is contained in $\mathbb{R}^n$ , so cannot be $K$ . First observation , if $K$ is a subset of some $\mathbb{R}^n$ , then setting $j$ as the inclusion, we retrieve the definition of a retract, i.e exists a retraction which leaves $K=K'$ untouched. And now the my reasoning. According to my understandings, any retract $K$ of an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ seems to be an ENR according to def. 2. Then noticing that any open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is trivially ENR, we can apply the following result [tom Dieck Proposition 18.4.3] Proposition 18.4.3 Let $X$ be an ENR. Suppose $f_0,f_1 \colon Y \to X$ are maps which coincide on a subset $B\subset Y$ . Then there exists a neighbourhood $W$ of $B$ in $Y$ and a homotopy $h \colon f_0|W \simeq_{rel B} \ \  f_1|W$ Take $Y=W=X$ and consider $f_0=Id_W$ and $f_1=i\circ r$ where $W \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an open nbd of $K$ ENR. $W$ is ENR and using the prop ( $B$ is $K$ clearly) we have that $K$ is a deformation retract of $W'\subset W$ . So in conclusion, it seems to be true that any retract of an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a deformation retract of some open nbd, and up to restriction, any retract of some opens, is instead a def. retract of it. So to recap, I drew these conclusions: 1) In the case $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ , ENR if an only if Deformation retract (up to restriction of the open nbd) 2) In the general case, if the nbd of $X$ is ENR on its own, then (up to restriction)the two notions are equivalent.

1470402,"When solving for eigenvector, when do you have to check every equation?","For example, suppose we want to solve for the eigenvectors of: $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 2 & -1 \end{bmatrix} $$ We quickly find the eigenvalues are $1, -2$ i.e. $\sigma(A) = \{1, -2\}$ Then $Av_1 = \lambda_1 v_1$ $$ \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 2 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}v_{11} \\ v_{12} \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} -2v_{11} \\ -2v_{12} \end{bmatrix}$$ We get two equations: $v_{12} = -2 v_{11}$ $2v_{11} - v_{12} = -2 v_{12}$ Solving either equation will yield equivalent eigenvectors i.e. $v_1 = [1 -2]^T$. What account for this property? Why is it that we only need to check for one equation in this case? Are there conditions or criteria for when we should check all equations instead just a single one?","['vector-spaces', 'matrices', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'matrix-rank', 'linear-algebra']"

Find the $w$ range. My attempt：
since
$$\sin{(wa)}\le 1,\sin{(wb)}\le 1,\sin{(wc)}\le 1$$
then $$\sin{(wa)}=\sin{(wb)}=\sin{(wc)}=1$$ $$aw=\dfrac{\pi}{2}+2k_{1}\pi,k_{1}\in Z$$

Let $k$, $r$ be positive integers such that $2k-1 \leqslant r$ and let $p$ a prime number such that $r < p$. I would like to find the rank of the following $k \times k$ matrix with coefficients in the field $F_p$ 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\binom {r}{k} & \binom {r}{k+1} & \dotsm & \binom {r}{2k-1}\\

\binom {r}{1} & \binom {r}{2} & \dotsm & \binom {r}{k}

1470489,"If I show that an iterated integral is less than $\infty$, does it necessarily mean that the integral is finite?","I am currently trying to show that an function has a finite integral. I am trying to find the iterated integral of: $$
\frac{e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}}\frac{1}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}}\frac{e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}}\frac{1}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}}
$$ over $-\infty < \alpha, \beta <\infty$. I am able to see that $\frac{e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}}\frac{1}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}} < e^{|\alpha + 0.3\beta|}$, and that $\frac{e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}}\frac{1}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}} < e^{|\alpha + 0.05\beta|}$. Hence, I have that: $$
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}}\frac{1}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}}\frac{e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}}\frac{1}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}} d\alpha d\beta
$$ $$
< \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}e^{|\alpha + 0.3\beta|} e^{|\alpha + 0.05\beta|}d\alpha d\beta = \infty
$$ How I got the $\infty$ was by looking at the four cases, when $|\alpha + 0.3\beta|$ is greater than or less than 0, and when $|\alpha + 0.05\beta|$ is greater than or less than 0. However, if I look at alpha, it will either be $e^{-\alpha}e^{\alpha} = 1$, $e^{\alpha}e^{\alpha} = e^{2\alpha}$, or $e^{-\alpha}e^{-\alpha} = e^{-2\alpha}$. In any of these cases, the integral with $d\alpha$ will be infinity. Would this suffice to conclude that: $$
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}}\frac{1}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.3\beta}}\frac{e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}}\frac{1}{1+e^{\alpha + 0.05\beta}} d\alpha d\beta < \infty

1470490,Fixed Effects Estimation,"Consider the following panel data regression model: $$y_{it}=X_{it}\beta+\alpha_{i}+u_{it},$$ where $\alpha_{i}$ indicate
the nuisance parameters (indiviudal specific), $y_{it}$ is an $nt\times1$
vector of the dependent variable, $i$ represents individual $i$
, $t$ represents the time period, $X_{it}$ is an $nt\times k$ matrix
of the regressors, $\beta$ is a $k\times1$ vector of coefficients
that need to be estimated and $u_{it}$ is an $nt\times1$ vector of
the error terms assumed to be orthogonal to the regressors, conditional
on $\alpha_{i}$. When we estimate this panel data model by fixed
effects, we include a dummy variable for every individual, effectively
removing the nuisance paramter. This is equivalent to demeaning the
data and estimating $(y_{it}-\bar{y_{i})}=(X_{it}-\bar{X_{i}})\beta+(u_{it}-\bar{u})$.
In a sense, we are 'controlling' for time invariant individual unboservables
in order to get unbiased estimates of our parameters of interest.
Intuitively, I was wondering if the parameter estimates we obtain
are equivalent to estimating the coefficients separetely for
each individual and then averaging over all individuals?","['statistics', 'statistical-inference']"
