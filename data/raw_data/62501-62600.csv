711018,Generating the symmetric group $S_n$,"I know that $\sigma =(1 2 \ldots n)$ and $\tau =(1 2)$ together should generate the symmetric group by virtue of conjugation, i.e. $(\sigma)^k \circ \tau \circ (\sigma^{-1})^k = (k+1, k+2)$; we know that the set of adjacent transpositions generates $S_n$, so we're done. However-- and I realize that this question is incredibly dumb-- when I try this for $n=3$, I should have that $\sigma \circ \tau \circ \sigma^{-1} = (2 3)$. But I get $\sigma \circ \tau = (1 2 3) \circ (1 2) = (2 3)$ when I work it out by hand, writing out the digits and physically switching them; then $(2 3)\circ \sigma^{-1}= (1 3)$. What am I doing wrong? EDIT: I'd confused sigma and tau. I've edited the question to reflect this.","['symmetric-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
711075,Understanding a Proof for Why $\ell^2$ is Complete,"Setting: Let $(x_n)$ be Cauchy in $\ell^2$ over $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$.  I'm trying to show that $(x_n) \rightarrow x \in \ell^2$.  That is, I'm trying to show that $\ell^2$ is complete in a particular way outlined below.  I only used the first few steps of the proof because once I understand the third step I think I can understand how the rest of the proof unfolds. Attempt: View $(x_k) = (x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ s.t. $$
x_k = x_{k,1}, x_{k,2}, \ldots
$$ For any $i \in \mathbb{N}$ we have that for large enough $n$ and $m$ that $$
 \left| x_{i,m} - x_{i,n} \right| < \varepsilon
$$ Therefore $$
\sum_{i=1}^\infty \left| x_{i,m} - x_{i,n} \right| < \varepsilon
$$ Question: Why is this last step true?  I can see how if it is true, then for $k$ large enough we would have that $\{x_{i,k}\}_{i=1}^\infty \rightarrow y_i$ for some $y_i \in \mathbb{F}$ (since $\mathbb{F}$ is complete).","['linear-algebra', 'complex-analysis', 'analysis']"

I'm trying to prepare myself for competitions in the future and I'm trying to improve my problem solving skills. I've come accross this problem from the book ""Problems in mathematical analysis"" by Witkowski and Piotr. It asks us to find the set of accumulation points of $$A=\{ \sqrt{n}-\sqrt{m}: m,n \in \mathbb{N} \}$$ Well, I guess $0$ is one of the accumlation points. Because if we set $n=m+1$ then we'll find a non-constant subsequence that converges $0$. I've been trying to find other non-constant sequences that converge to other real numbers, but I haven't succeeded so far. I'm very hesitant to think that $0$ is the only accumulation point of $A$. The main problem is that $n$ and $m$ must be natural numbers, that is very restricting for my intuition. I tried several subsequences of $\sqrt{n}-\sqrt{m}$ by hand or by using wolfram alpha but either they diverged to infinity or they converged to $0$. So, please, give me some hints. I'm NOT looking for a full solution YET! Just give me some ideas about how a problem solver might attack this problem. If this problem shows up in a competition, how should I analyze it? Should I start by trying several subsequences of it to get a picture or I should think more abstractly? If you're giving a hint, please try to explain how that idea has come to you.

711192,Two random variables from the same probability density function: how can they be different?,"The definition of $X$ as a random variable according to Wiki is as follows: $Let (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space and $(E,
> \mathcal{E})$ a measurable space. Then an $(E, \mathcal{E})$-valued
  random variable is a function $X\colon \Omega \to E$ which is
  $(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{E})$-measurable. The latter means that, for
  every subset $B\in\mathcal{E}$, its preimage $X^{-1}(B)\in
> \mathcal{F}$ where $X^{-1}(B) = \{\omega : X(\omega)\in B\}$. This
  definition enables us to measure any subset B in the target space by
  looking at its preimage, which by assumption is measurable. And for real-valued random variables: In this case the observation space is the real numbers. Recall,
  $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ is the probability space. For real
  observation space, the function $X\colon \Omega \rightarrow

> \mathbb{R}$. Now in statistics and fields alike, they introduce random variables like $X \sim p(x)$ where $p(x)$ is a probability distribution. My question is if you say that $X\sim p(x)$ and $Y\sim p(x)$ how can these two represent two different random variables (like two different standard normal random variables) when they are sampled from the same $p(x)$, viz. how should you translate this to the formal measure theoretic definition that could differentiate between these two?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'probability', 'random-variables']"

711201,Are a finite cylinder and the corresponding planes iso/homeomorphic?,"Let me give some context first. In the scope of physics, I often have to compute the area of the side of  a right circular cylinder with height $h$ and radius $r$, namely $2\pi rh$. I think this can be proven by integration (please enlighten me about that). The way I ""prove"" this formula is unorthodox: take a rectangle with sides $2\pi r$ and $h$. Stick the sides of length $h$ together and you get a right circular cylinder of  height $h$ and radius $r$.  Hence the formula for the area of the side of the cylinder. (Also please tell me if this reasoning has any mathematical significance). This led me to topological thoughts : is a right circular cylinder of, say, radius $1$ and height $h$, so described as the set $$\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid x^2+y^2=1, 0 \leq z \leq h \}$$ iso/homeomorphic to any rectangle of sides $2\pi$ and $h$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ ? Inspired by this Homeomorphism between punctured plane and cylinder , I think the homeomorphism  $f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta,\log(r))$ fails because $\log$ doesn't respect limitations on $z$. I tend to think $f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta,r)$ works here...","['general-topology', 'geometry']"

711287,What is wrong with my calculation about a wave equation here?,"Consider the following wave equation in ""negative"" time: $$u_{tt}=\Delta u, \quad x\in {\Bbb R}^3, \ \color{red}{t<0}$$

  $$
u(x,0)=g(x),\quad u_t(x,0)=0,\quad x\in{\Bbb R}^3.
$$ For $t>0$, define $v:\Bbb{R}^3\times[0,\infty)\to{\Bbb R}$ as 
$$v(x,s):=u(x,-s).$$
Then we have
$$
v_{s}(x,s)=u_t(x,-s)\cdot(-1),\quad v_{ss}(x,s)=u_{tt}(x,-s)\cdot (-1)(-1)=u_{tt}(x,-s)
$$
and $$
\Delta v(x,s)=\Delta u(x,-s).

  $$
v(x,0)=g(x),\quad v_t(x,0)=0,\quad x\in{\Bbb R}^3.

  $$
v(x,t)=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{1}{4\pi t}\int_{B(x;|t|)}g(y)dS(y)

$$
  which implies that when $t<0$,
  $$
u(x,t)=v(x,-t)=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{1}{4\pi (-t)}\int_{B(x;|t|)}g(y)dS(y)
\right).
$$ When $g(x)\equiv 1$, using the formula above, we have
$$
u(x,t)=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{1}{4\pi (-t)}(4\pi t^2)
\right)=-1.
$$
It follows that 
$$

Definition 6.3.9 states that we let $R_1$ and $R_2$ be relations on a set $S$. The composition of $R_2$ with $R_1$ is the relation $R_2 \circ R_1 =[(x,y) \in S \times S :(\exists v \in S)((x,v) \in R_1 \land (v,y) \in R_2$. Definition 6.2.9 states that we let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a set $S$. For each element $x \in S $ the set $[x]=[y \in S: (x,y) \in R$ is the equivalence class with respect to $R$. Definition 6.2.3 states that $R$ is transitive if $( \forall x, y,z \in S)((x,y) \in R \land (y,z) \in R) \rightarrow (x,z) \in R)$ Definition 3.1.2 states that we let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Then A is the subset of B, written $ A \subseteq B$ when the statement $(\forall x)[x \in A \rightarrow x \in B]$ My attempt: We have a biconditional statement. If $R$ is transitive, then $R \circ R \subseteq R$. By definition 6.2.3 $R$ is transitive if $( \forall x, y,z \in S)((x,y) \in R \land (y,z) \in R) \rightarrow (x,z) \in R)$ The final result of the proof has to be $(x,z)$ but I don't know the steps...then afterwards by applying definition 6.3.9, we have $R \circ R =[(x,z) \in S \times S :(\exists v \in S)((x,v) \in R \land (v,z) \in R$. Next, we apply definition 6.2.9 , so we have,   $[x]=[z \in S: (x,z) \in R$ Since $ R \circ R \subseteq R$ from definition 3.1.2, we know that $R \circ R$ is a subset of $R$. They have elements in common as well. If $R \circ R \subseteq R$, then $R$ is transitive. By definition 3.1.2, we have $(\forall x)[x \in R \circ R \rightarrow x \in R]$ By definition 6.3.9, we have $R \circ R =[(x,y) \in S \times S :(\exists v \in S)((x,v) \in R \land (v,y) \in R$. So, I know that we have $(x,y)$ involved for $R \circ R \subseteq R$, but what I don't understand is how to bring the $z$ into the picture because the transitive definition has $\forall x,y,z $, so there's like three elements while $ R \circ R$ and $R$ has two. I can see that they do belong to each other because both of them have $(x,y)$ in the definitions. Somehow I need to have the $(x,z)$ as the final result, but the problem is that I don't know how to prove that R is transitive...this was a part of my last homework and I didn't do too well on that part. If only $R$ was reflexive or symmetric then I would know what's going on because there are two elements which are $x$ and $y$.","['relations', 'equivalence-relations', 'elementary-set-theory', 'function-and-relation-composition']"

My try was the following: $M=\mathbb{R}^3$, and $E\in\mathfrak{X}(M)$ the electric field due to a point charge on the origin we have using the spherical coordinate system $$E = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \dfrac{1}{r^3} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial r},$$ we want to compute the divergence of $E$ using differential forms. Considering then the metric tensor $g = dr^2+r^2d\theta^2+ r^2\sin^2\phi d\phi^2$ we can associate a $1$-form to $E$. Before doing that we are going to use basis $dr$, $r d\theta$, $r\sin\theta d\phi$ so that the metric tensor has the identity matrix at each point. Now, the form associated with $E$, has components $E_i$ given by $$E_i = g_{ij}E^j,$$ then since $g_{ij} = 0$ for $i\neq j$, $g_{11}=1$ and since $E^j = 0$ for $j \neq 1$ there remains just $E_1 = E^1$ so that we consider the $1$-form $$E^\flat = \dfrac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \dfrac{1}{r^3}dr,$$ but this is a $1$-form, since we want divergence we need a $2$-form, so we want to take the hodge star operator. In the basis we are working with it maps $dr\mapsto r^2\sin\theta d\theta\wedge d\phi$ so that we have $$\ast E^\flat = \dfrac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac{1}{r^3}r^2\sin\theta d\theta\wedge d\phi$$ now we take the exterior derivative of this which by definition is $$d(\ast E^\flat) = \dfrac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_0}d\left(\dfrac{1}{r^3}\right)\wedge r^2\sin\theta d\theta\wedge d\phi = \dfrac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac{-3}{r^2}dr\wedge rd\theta\wedge r\sin\theta d\phi,$$ but this isn't right.

Then, every contractive completely positive map $\phi:E\rightarrow B(H)$ extends to a contractive completely positive map $\bar{\phi}: A\rightarrow B(H)$. Proof. Let $P_{i}\in B(H)$ be an increasing net of finite-rank projections which converge to the identity in the strong operator topology. For each $i$, we regard the contractive completely positive map $\phi_{i}: E \rightarrow P_{i}B(H)P_{i}$, $\phi_{i}(e)=P_{i}\phi(e)P_{
i}$ as taking values in a matrix algebra. Thus , by Corollary 1.5.16, we may assume that each $\phi_{i}$ is actually defined on all of $A$.

Keep going on this way and you'll have an increasing sequence of positive terms that is bounded above by $x$.. Therefore the sequence must be convergent..

While thinking about planar graphs, I noticed that a finite planar graph corresponds to a (finite) polygonisation of the Euclidean plane (or whichever surface you're working with). By considering, for example a full triangulation of the plane, you can find an object that I feel perfectly comfortable considering as a countably infinite planar graph. Can we take this even further? As soon as you start considering uncountably many vertices, you necessarily get accumulation points in the plane (as the plane is separable). Can we find a (formal) way for the property of being planar to make sense in such a context? Perhaps something along the lines of: ""an infinite graph is planar if every finite subgraph is planar."" It seems that our graph can have cardinality at most the continuum, as a planar graph defines a natural injection from the set of vertices into the plane (although perhaps this breaks down if we use the above definition?) For finite graphs, you can always extend a planar graph to a maximal planar graph. Can we use Zorn's lemma to do the same for arbitrary uncountable planar graph? For example, if we take the real line as an uncountable path in the sense of graph theory, it certainly feels like it should give an example of a continuum-cardinality planar graph. Our course mainly focused on finite graphs. Still, we considered a couple of uncountable examples every now and again when there was something interesting to say. I would be grateful for any insight/references/nudges in a fruitful direction that anybody could provide.","['planar-graphs', 'graph-theory', 'elementary-set-theory']"

712087,Problems with a proof that -in a linear order- a minimal element is the smallest element,"I have a problem with a proof I found in Velleman's ""How to prove it"". This is sort of interesting, because it is the very first time I cannot see the structure of a proof presented in the book. The following are the theorem and Velleman's proof. Theorem: Suppose $R$ is a partial order on a set $A$, and $B \subseteq A$. If $R$ is a total order and $b$ is a minimal element of $B$, then $b$ is the smallest element of $B$. Velleman's Proof: Suppose $R$ is a total order and $b$ is a minimal element of $B$. Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $B$. If $x = b$, then since $R$ is reflexive, $bRx$. Now suppose $x \neq b$. Since $R$ is a total order, we know that either $xRb$ or $bRx$. But $xRb$ can’t be true, since by combining $xRb$ with our assumption that $x \neq b$ we could conclude that $b$ is not minimal, thereby contradicting our assumption that it is minimal. Thus, $bRx$ must be true. Since $x$ was arbitrary, we can conclude that $ \forall x \in B(bRx)$, so $b$ is the smallest element of $B$. Problem My problem is with the structure of the proof. In particular, I see a bit as a ""rabbit out of the hat"" the fact that we start by assuming that $x \neq b$. In the pages of the book before the the actual proof, the author presents the scratch work behind the proof. Now, I can see the logic behind it (the all problem about the $x$ being or not being equal to $b$), but I do not see how this smoothly enters in the picture of the proof. Just consider that using ""Proof Designer"" (the software that can be found on Velleman's site and that goes along the book), I could actually prove the theorem without starting with the assumption that $x \neq b$. Indeed, the proof in words should go along the following lines: Proof: Assume that $B \subseteq A$, that $R$ is a total order, and that $b$ is a minimal element of $B$. Let $x \in B$ be arbitrary. Thus, by the fact that $b$ is minimal, we have that if $(x,b) \in R$, then $x=b$. Proceed by cases. 1. $(x,b) \notin R$: Since $x \in B$ and $b \in B$, we can conclude that $x \in A$ and $b \in A$. From the completeness of $R$ we have that either $(x,b) \in R$ or $(b,x) \in R$. Thus, by assumption that $(x,b) \notin R$, we have that  $(b,x) \in R$. 2. $x=b$: Since $x \in B$ and $b \in B$, we can conclude that $x \in A$ and $b \in A$. From the reflexivity of $R$ we have that $(b,b) \in R$. But, since by assumption $x=b$, we can conclude that $(b,x) \in R$.  QED QUESTIONS: Is my proof sound? Is there somebody who can give me a feedback on what is actually the structure of Velleman's proof? I actually tried to replicated Velleman's structure of the proof with ""Proof Designer"", but I did not succeed. Thanks a lot for any help. PS: Conditional on my proof being sound, any feedback on the writing is more than wellcome.","['proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification', 'order-theory']"

Case 2) Let $G(v) = 0$, $v$ as above it follows that: $$ F(G(v))=\lambda v = F(0)=0 \implies \lambda =0 \text{ because } v \neq 0  $$ It is clear to me that I cannot use $G(v)= 0$ as an Eigenvector of $G \circ F$ because $G(v)$ is now the zero vector and therefore, by definition, not a Eigenvector. Therefore I have to come up with a better statement $$\ker (G \circ F) \neq \lbrace 0 \rbrace \iff \lambda =0 \text{ is a Eigenvalue of } G \circ F \tag{*} $$
I have several problems now with the above statement (*), focussing on the $\implies$ direction Can I use the same Vector $v \in V \setminus \lbrace 0 \rbrace $ for this statement? It is not really clear to me if and why I can do this, I believe that I have to, because all I know for this case is that $G(v)=0 \implies v \in \ker \lbrace G \rbrace $ and applying $F$ to both sides would give $ F(G(v))=F(0)=0 \implies v \in \ker \lbrace F \circ G \rbrace $. If I for example just say let $ k \in \ker (G \circ F ) \neq \lbrace 0 \rbrace $ such that $k$ is an Eigenvector of $G \circ F$ with Eigenvalue $\lambda$ it would follow that $$G(F(k))= \lambda k = 0 \implies \lambda =0  $$
which seems very artificial (or forced up) to me, furthermore I have not even made use of my premise that $G(v) = 0$, so the above procedure must be wrong. On the other hand if I choose $v \in \ker \lbrace G \circ F\rbrace \neq \lbrace 0 \rbrace $ (which I don't know if I am allowed to do) it would follow that: $$G(F(v))=\lambda v=0 \implies \lambda =0  $$

712212,Spectral gap of mixture of Markov chains,"Context Let $P$ be the transition matrix of an irreducible, aperiodic, discrete-time Markov chain. The spectral gap is given by $$\xi = 1 - \lambda_\max$$ where $\lambda_\max = \max\{\lambda_2, -\lambda_n\}$, i.e. the second largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix $P$. This is related to the mixing time of the Markov chain; the bigger the spectral gap, the faster the convergence to the stationary distribution.

It then follows that $u$ is Lipshitz continuous and has $\sigma$ as a Lipschitz constant. We have that $\Vert \nabla u \Vert_{L^{\infty}} \leq \liminf\limits_{m\rightarrow \infty} \Vert \nabla u_{m} \Vert \leq \sigma$ since the norm is lower semi-continuous. We first note that since $u \in W^{1,\infty}(I)$ it follows that $u$ is locally Lipschitz (since $I$ is compact it follows that $u$ is Lipschitz on $I$). So $u$ is differentiable almost everywhere in the classic sense of differentiation. We now use the following: Consider $\phi(t):= u(tx + (1-t)y)$    $\text{     }$     for  $\text{          }$     $t \in [0,1]$ Then $\phi(1) - \phi(0)  = \int_{0}^{1}{\phi}^{'}(t)dt = \int_{0}^{1}\nabla u(tx + (1-t)y)\cdot(x-y)dt$ $\therefore |u(x) - u(y)| \leq \int_{0}^{1}|u(tx+(1-t)y)||x-y|dt \leq \Vert \nabla u \Vert_{L^{\infty}}|x-y| \leq \sigma|x-y|$ This shows that $u$ is locally Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant $\sigma$.

712357,Showing a subcategory of $\mathbf{Top}$ is Cartesian-Closed,"We start with some preliminary definitions (necessary because there is not much literature on this): a test map is a continuous function $\varphi:V\rightarrow X$ where $V$ is an open subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$. Given a topological space $X$, we say that a subset $U$ of $X$ is numerically open if $\varphi^{-1}(U)$ is open for every test map $\varphi$. A topological space $X$ is said to be numerically generated if a subset $U$ of $X$ is open if and only if it is numerically open. Given any topological space $X$, we define the numericalization of $X$, denoted $X^\#$, to be the set underlying $X$ equipped with the final topology induced by the family of test maps into $X$. The numerically generated product of two numerically generated spaces $X$ and $Y$ is the numericalization of the product space $X\times Y$ (henceforth simply denoted $X\times Y$). The numerically generated mapping space of the numerically generated spaces $X$ and $Y$, denoted $Map(X,Y)$, is the collection of all continuous maps from $X$ to $Y$ equipped with the numericalization of the compact-open topology. The category $\mathbf{Num}$ is the full subcategory of $\mathbf{Top}$ with objects as numerically generated spaces; this has as coproduct the disjoint union with the disjoint union topology (it is not difficult to show that the disjoint union of numerically generated spaces is numerically generated) and product as the numerically generated product. I wish to show that $\mathbf{Num}$ is a cartesian-closed category.  Ultimately, this simply boils down to showing that the numerically generated mapping space is an exponential object in $\mathbf{Num}$.

712538,Spectral decomposition of $TT^*$,"On $l_{2}$ let $T$ be given by $Te_{n}=\frac{e_{n+1}}{n+1}$ where $(e_{n})_{n\ge1}$ is the canonical orthonormal basis. Find the spectral decomposition of $TT^*$. I find that $T^*(e_{n})=\frac{e_{n-1}}{n}$ for $n$ greater than 1 and $T^*(e_{1})=0$
I find that the $e_{n}$ are the orthonormal eigenvectors for $TT^*$ with corresponding eigenvalues $\frac{1}{n^2}$ for $n\ge2$ and $0$ for $n=1$ so that the spectral decomposition is $TT^*x=\sum_{i=2}^{{\infty}}\frac{1}{n^2}\langle x,e_{n}\rangle e_{n}$.

712547,How likely is it not to be anyone's best friend?,"A teenage acquaintance of mine lamented: Every one of my friends is better friends with somebody else. Thanks to my knowledge of mathematics I could inform her that she's not alone and $e^{-1}\approx 37\%$ of all people could be expected to be in the same situation, which I'm sure cheered her up immensely. This number assumes that friendships are distributed randomly, such that each person in a population of $n$ chooses a best friend at random. Then the probability that any given person is not anyone's best friend is $(1-\frac{1}{n-1})^{n-1}$, which tends to $e^{-1}$ for large $n$. Afterwards I'm not sure this is actually the best way to analyze the claim. Perhaps instead we should imagine assigning a random ""friendship strength"" to each edge in the complete graph on $n$ vertices, in which case my friend's lament would be ""every vertex I'm connected to has an edge with higher weight than my edge to it"". This is not the same as ""everyone choses a best friend at random"", because it guarantees that there's at least one pair of people who're mutually best friends, namely the two ends of the edge with the highest weight. (Of course, some people are not friends at all; we can handle that by assigning low weights to their mutual edges. As long as everyone has at least one actual friend, this won't change who are whose best friends). (It doesn't matter which distribution the friendship weights are chosen by, as long as it's continuous -- because all that matters is the relative order between the weights. Equivalently, one may simply choose a random total order on the $n(n-1)/2$ edges in the complete graph). In this model, what is the probability that a given person is not anyone's best friend? By linearity of expectations, the probability of being mutually best friends with anyone is $\frac{n-1}{2n-3}\approx\frac 12$ (much better than in the earlier model), but that doesn't take into account the possibility that some poor soul has me as their best friend whereas I myself has other better friends. Linearity of expectation doesn't seem to help here -- it tells me that the expected number of people whose best friend I am is $1$, but not the probability of this number being $0$.

712566,Area of the intersection of regular pentagons,"I was playing around in Geogebra and came up with an interesting problem. Take an arbitrary point $A$ and draw a circle with center $A$. Then draw any line through $A$. Call the points where the circle intersects with the line $B$ and $C$. Construct two regular pentagons with base $AB$ and $AC$, such that the pentagons intersect in a kite-shaped region. What is the area of the region divided by the area of either of the pentagons? I created a diagram with the circle removed: Now, using Mathematica, trigonometry, and analytical geometry, I was able to come up with a solution: $$ 2-\frac{4 \sqrt{5}}{5} $$ I won't reproduce the entire solution here, I'll just give a quick sketch. Referring to the above figure, I considered $A$ to be the center of the coordinate system, and let each pentagon have side length one. I found the $y$-coordinate of $H$ by adding the apothem and the radius of the pentagon. The slope of line $HG$ must be $\tan 144^\circ$, so I was able to find the equation of the line, and therefore, the $y$-coordinate of $J$ which is equal to $JA$. I found $GF = DF - DG$. After that, I had the two diagonals of the kite so I found the area. Finally, I divided by the area of the pentagon. As you might imagine, this solution isn't really feasible by hand. Is there a solution which uses only geometry (or clean trigonometry, where ""clean"" is subjectively defined)?","['geometry', 'polygons', 'trigonometry']"

I've tried to manipulate MC = CD in Einstein notation (C, a matrix that diagonalizes M and D, the matrix of eigenvalues) with little luck. I've also tried manipulation of arbitrary elements of M*C and C*D to get an expression for the inner product of the eigenvectors, but I'm not finding any relationships that force the dot product to be non-zero when the off-diagonal elements of M aren't equal.

712619,Shortcut in proof of continuity/differentiability in inverse function theorem,"The messiest, least interesting part of the various proofs of the inverse function theorem comes after you have constructed the inverse function and must now establish continuity and differentiability. The estimates required are not very hard, but it has always bothered me aesthetically. While pondering this today, I realized that these estimates could be bypassed if continuity and differentiability were defined in terms of topological and geometrical properties of the graph. If $f : X \subset \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is invertible then $\Gamma_f = \{(x, f(x)) : x \in X\} \subset \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\Gamma_{f^{-1}}$ are related by an isometry, so a characterization of continuity and differentiability in terms of a function's graph would immediately imply that $f$ is continuous or differentiable iff the same is true for $f^{-1}$. With a single variable, we have the characterization that $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous iff its graph is connected and closed in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For differentiability, we can consider the pencil of lines through a point $x$ and say that $f$ is differentiable at $x$ iff the graph is pathwise connected in a neighborhood $U \subset \Gamma_f$ of $x$ and if for all sequences $\{x_i\}$ in $U$ converging to $x$ the corresponding secants all converge (in the projective space structure) to the same limit. With this, we have a completely qualitative proof of the inverse function theorem for one variable. Assume $f$ is continuously differentiable and that $f'(x_0) \neq 0$. By continuity of $f'$, we see that $f'$ has constant sign in a neighborhood of $x_0$. Therefore $f$ is locally monotone and hence invertible on that neighborhood. As f is continuous and differentiable and we've defined these properties in terms of graphs, it follows that this local inverse is likewise continuous and differentiable since the two graphs are reflections. What about definitions for the general case of $f : X \subset \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$? Well, the definition of differentiability is easily extended. Instead of sequences of single points, we must use sequences of $m$-tuples of points and require that the points in each tuple are affinely independent so they span an $m$-flat in $\mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$. The pencil of lines is replaced with the pencil of $m$-flats carrying the standard structure as a Grassmannian. Straightforward stuff, I think. The thing I'm unsure about is whether the graph-based definition of continuity can be extended to several variables. The definition using closedness and connectedness works for $m = 1$ since $\mathbb{R}^n$ is locally compact, but for larger $m$ there are counterexamples already with $m = 2$ and $n = 1$. Can the definition of graph-based continuity be repaired to work for all $m$ and $n$? At least in the $n \geq m$ case we care about for the IFT? Maybe the one based on closedness and connectedness is actually adequate if we presuppose graph-based differentiability as well? Do you see any holes in my reasoning?","['general-topology', 'geometry', 'real-analysis']"

712728,"Morse functions are dense in $C^{\infty}(M,\mathbb{R})$ questions.","Hi here is a proof inspired from the reference below. Feel free to get very technical with your comments so that at the end I understand it well. 
I am more concerned about the questions I added below, so if you want feel free to go straight in answering the questions. Morse function is generic in $C^{\infty}M$,where M is compact smooth manifold. Proof: Step 1 Given any smooth f on M we have: By compactness $\exists$ finitely many coordinate charts $ \{V_{p}\ ,\ \phi_{p}\}$,$M\subset \bigcup_{k=1}^{N}V_{k}$ 
 with coordinates $x_{p,1},...,x_{p,m}\ $. Define $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^{N\cdot m}\times M\ni (\lambda_{p,i},x) \mapsto  f(x)+\sum_{p}\sum_{i=1,...,m}\lambda_{p,i}x_{p,i}(x)\cdot \phi_{p}(x) \in \mathbb{R}$ $\Rightarrow d\Phi:\mathbb{R}^{N\cdot m}\times M\to T^{*}M$, $d\Phi(\lambda_{p,i},x)=df(x)+\sum_{p,i=1,...,m}\lambda_{p,i}dl_{p,i}(x)$. Step 2 We will show that $d\Phi\pitchfork 0_{M}$ and so we can approximate f by a Morse function. Any $x\in M$ is contained in some $V_{p_{x}}$ and so setting $\lambda_{p,i}=0 ~\forall ~p\neq p_{x}$ we get: $df+\sum_{i=1,...,m} \lambda_{p_{x},i}dx_{i} \Rightarrow$ by varying $\lambda_{p_{x},i}$, we get span$(x,\{df+\sum_{i=1,...,m} \lambda_{p_{x},i}dx^{i}\})=\{x\} \times T_{x}^{*}M $ $\stackrel{0_{M}~const.}{\Rightarrow} T(T_{x}^{*}M) =\{x\}\times T_{x}^{*}M+T_{x}^{*}M\times \{x\}=T_{x}(d\Phi_{x})+T_{x}(0_{M})\stackrel{P.~Tran.(*)}{\Rightarrow}$ $d\Phi_{\lambda}\pitchfork 0_{M} $ ~ a.e. $\stackrel{\lambda\to 0}{\Rightarrow}f(x)+\sum_{p,i=1,...,m}\lambda_{p,i}l_{p,i}(x)\pitchfork 0_{M}$ $ \square$ (*) By P.Trans., I mean the following lemma: If smooth $F:M\times S\to N$ has $F\pitchfork Z\subset N$,then $f_{s}\pitchfork Z$,where $f_{s} (x)= F(x,s):M\to  N ~$ for a.e. s. $\textbf{Questions}$: Is $\Phi$ well-defined in the intersections of charts i.e. $V_{p}\cap V_{p'}$ ?
