106546,Can the natural numbers be uncountable?,"Definition of a countable set, from Stanford , as I didn't want to quote Wikipedia : Definition. A set S is countable if |S| = | N |. Thus a set S is countable if there is a one-to-one mapping of Num onto S, that is, if S is the range of an infinite one-to-one sequence. So it seems that if we can define a set of numbers that does not map one-to-one to the natural numbers, then it is not a countable set. The natural numbers quite obviously map one-to-one to the natural numbers, so can they possibly be uncountable? Let's say we have a list containing all of the natural numbers. Excerpt: ... 000099 000100 000101 000102 ... We can define a number that is different from each element in this list as follows: for the i th number in the list, the i th digit is one of the 8 (or 9) non-zero alternatives that make our new number different from the number on the list. For example: ... 00009 9 0001 0 0 000 1 01 00 0 102 ... 12 3456 As we keep going, we will end up with a sequence of non-zero digits, which forms a valid Natural number, that is not on our list of all natural numbers, so our mapping of the natural numbers to the natural numbers breaks. Does this make sense, or is there something I'm missing?","['natural-numbers', 'elementary-set-theory', 'combinatorics']"
106553,"Volumes of cones, spheres, and cylinders","Given a sphere with radius r, a cone with radius r and height 2r, and a cylinder with radius r and height 2r, the sum of the volume of the cone and sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder. If we look at the volume formulas, this is obvious. However, any ordinary person without mathematical training probably wouldn't find this intuitive. I recall reading in a museum exhibit that before proving anything, Archimedes was able to slice up the sphere and cone and fit the pieces together into the cylinder--all in his mind. Can someone explain how one can slice up the shapes to do that?","['geometry', 'calculus', 'math-history']"
106558,sub martingales and more,"This is a problem on sub-martingales. Given : $X_n = X_0 \mathrm{e}^{\mu  S_n}$, $n= 1,2,3,\ldots$, where $X_0 > 0$ and
where $S_n$ is a symmetric random walk and $\mu$ is greater than zero.
We have to prove that $\{X_n\}$ is a sub martingale. How do we go about this? I understand that, if $Z_n$ is a stochastic process, with $\mathbb{E}(Z_n) < \infty$ , then it is a sub martingale if $\mathbb{E}(Z_{n+1} | Z_1,Z_2,Z_3,\ldots,Z_n) \geqslant Z_n$.

106564,reducing $x^4+1$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Closed 12 years ago . Possible Duplicate: reducible polynomial modulo every prime Ok so we have to prove the following: If $R=\mathbb{Z}_p$ for $p$ a prime, then, $x^4+1$ is reducible over $R[x]$. This is are my ideas (please let me know if there is an easier way to tackle this problem): First if $p=2$ then we know that $x+1$ is a factor since $1^4+1=0$ and it follows that $x-1=x+1$ is a factor. Hence from now on let us assume $p$ is odd. First if $x^4+1=(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)$, I have that the leading coefficients in the factors is $1$ since I can always force this, and now I obtain the following: $bd=1$ $ad+bc=0$ $d+ac+b=0$ $a+c=0$ Where the above are obtained by multiplying out the factors and setting the coefficients for the value they ought to be. However, we can use the last equation and plug in the second equation, to obtain $a(b-d)=0$ and since $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a field, then we know it has no zero divisors. If $a=0$ then we have that $b=-d$ and hence $-d^2=1$, which means that $d^2=-1$. By using quadratic residues (here is where I worry since my class has not cover that) we have that if $p\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ then we know that (The Legendre Symbol) $(\frac{a}{p})=\bar{a}^{(p-1)/2}$, using $a=-1$, we have that $(\frac{a}{p})=1$, so $-1$ is not a quadratic residue, i.e., it is a square., hence $x^4+1=(x^4-(-1))=(x^2-d)(x^2+d)$ I am stuck in the case when $p\equiv 3\pmod{4}$.

106572,Unusual version of the binomial theorem?,"This was an old problem I had years ago, but never really solved. Maybe it can be cracked here? The situation is as follows. Denote by $\mathbb{Q}(q)[X,Y]$ the algebra of polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}(q)$, the field of rational functions. Moreover, $X$ and $Y$ are indeterminates but do not commute. Let $\mathbf{Q}[x,y]=\mathbb{Q}(q)[X,Y]/I$, with $I$ being the (two-sided) ideal generated by $YX-qXY$. So $\mathbf{Q}[X,Y]$ is the ring whose generators satisfy the relation $YX=qXY$. Why then is 
\[

&= \sum_iq^{n-i}\binom{n}{i}_qX^{i+1}Y^{n-i}+\sum_i \binom{n}{i}_qX^iY^{n-i+1}.

$$

106705,Find intersection(s) between parametrized parabola and a line,"I'm trying to find the value(s) of the parameter $t$ at the intersection point(s) between a 2D general parabola (as a parametric function of $t$) and a line whose equations can be derived from two points $p$ and $q$ ($p \not = q$).  The parabola is defined below: $$x(t) = \frac{1}{2} a_x t^2 + v_x t + x_0 \\
  y(t) = \frac{1}{2} a_y t^2 + v_y t + y_0$$ My Interest: If I could find this solution, then I could predict the time-to-collision between two non-rotating, rigid line segments.  By using the relative motion between them as the $a$ and $v$ in this parabolic curve for each point, and finding the intersection between it and the other line segment, I can find the smallest $t > 0$ such that the lines are colliding. This would be for a physics engine, and using acceleration in the calculation would allow for some huge efficiency gains (not having to constantly predict and handle collision between every pair of line segments, only during relevant time frames or when acceleration changes). Edit: Thanks to Andrea Mori, I was able to solve for this equation (given the line defined by $p$ and $q$): $$(q_y - p_y) x(t) - (q_x - p_x) y(t) - |p \times q| = 0$$ (By treating $a_x b_y - a_y b_x$ as equivalent to $\left| a \times b \right|$ for 2D).  Then, substituting $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, I was able to simplify down to more cross products: $$\frac{1}{2}\left(\left| a \times q \right| - \left| a \times p \right|\right) t^2 + (\left| v \times q \right| - \left| v \times p \right|)t + (\left| r \times q \right| - \left| r \times p \right| - \left| p \times q \right|) = 0$$ The quadratic formula can then be applied using the clearly visible $a$, $b$, and $c$ values (though writing it out would get ugly).  A negative discriminant ($b^2 - 4ac$) indicates no collision, zero indicates exactly one, and positive indicates two (the smallest $t > 0$ being the most important one). I think the second formula would then translate to 3D, though I don't know without evaluating it some more.","['conic-sections', 'parametric', 'algebra-precalculus']"

The problem reads: Let $K$ be an extension of $F$ of degree $n$. $\bf\text{(a)}$ For any $\alpha\in K$ prove that $\alpha$ acting by left multiplication on $K$ 
      is an $F$-linear transformation of $K$. $\bf\text{(b)}$ Prove that $K$ is isomorphic to a $\bf\underline{subfield}$ of the ring of $n\times n$ matrices over $F$, so the ring of $n\times n$ matrices over $F$ contains an isomorphic copy of every extension of degree $\leq n$. I've already worked out $\bf\text{(a)}$, it's the part in $\bf\text{(b)}$ about 
a ""$\bf\underline{subfield}$ of the ring of $n\times n$ matrices"" that I'm a bit confused on. What I have done so far is defined a map $\psi:K\to M_{n}(F)$ from $K$ to the ring of $n\times n$ matrices over $F$ given by $\psi(\iota)=\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{B}}(T_{\iota})$ where $\iota$ is any element of $K$, $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{B}}(T_{\iota})$ is the matrix that represents the $F$-linear transformation $T_{\iota}:K\to K$, with respect to a basis $\mathcal{B}$ of the vector space $K$. I can readily establish that $\psi$ is an injective homomorphism that is surjective to its image in $M_{n}(F)$ and since $K$ is a field, every nonzero $\alpha\in K$ has an inverse $\alpha^{-1}\in K$ so that $\psi(\alpha^{-1})=\psi(\alpha)^{-1}\in M_{n}(F)$. So this establishes an isomorphism between $K$ and the image of $K$ under $\psi$. This is the part that I'm confused about: the elements in $\text{im}\,(\psi)$ are elements of the noncommutative ring of $n\times n$ matrices over $F$. How is it that $\text{im}\,(\psi)$ is a subfield of $M_{n}(F)$ if a subfield is commutative and $M_{n}(F)$ is a noncommutative ring?

106807,(Possibly) alternative statement of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz,"In my notes, there is a statement entitled ""Nulstellensatz version 2"": If $k = \bar{k}$, and $\mathfrak{m} \subseteq k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a maximal ideal, then $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/\mathfrak{m} \cong k$.

I can see that ""version 2"" follows from the ""usual version"" as follows: Usual version $\implies$ $I(Z(\mathfrak{a})) = \sqrt{\mathfrak{a}}$ for ideals $\mathfrak{a}$ of $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.

So if $\mathfrak{m}$ is a maximal ideal, then it corresponds to a minimal irreducible closed subset of $k^n$ (since $\mathfrak{m}$ is prime and maximal), which must be a point $\{p = (p_1,\ldots,p_n)\}$. So $\mathfrak{m} = I(p)$, which one can see is just $\langle (x_1-p_1)\cdots(x_n-p_n) \rangle$. So $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/\mathfrak{m} \cong k$ via the ""evaluate at $p$"" map.

106832,Eigenvalues of a infinitesimal generator matrix,"Consider a Markov process on a finite state space $S$, whose dynamic is determined by a certain infinitesimal generator $Q$ (that is a matrix in this case) and an initial distribution $m$. 1) Is there anything general that can be said on the spectrum of the matrix $-Q$? 2) Is there any bounds on the eigenvalues of $-Q$? And on their ratios? I am interested in linear algebra results as well as more probabilistic ones, maybe using information about the structure of the state space or on the process itself. 
If can be of any help, for the problem I am addressing, I usually have a quite big state space and the Q-matrix is quite sparse, but unfortunately without any symmetry or nice structure. For discrete-time Markov chains there is an huge literature linking properties of the spectrum of the transition matrix $P$ to various mixing times, geometric properties of the state space, etc. Of course one can move from the continuous setting to the discrete one via uniformization and thus ""translate"" most of these results, but I was wondering the following 3) Is there any bounds on the eigenvalues developed specifically for the continuous time setting?

Suppose a person from town $A$ goes in a boat with velocity $v$ to $B$, always poiting at $B$ (see the picture), and let the river flow in the positive direction of $y$ with velocity $u$. Find the curve that gives the person's trayectory over time. In an arbitrary point of the curve there will always be a system of three vectors, $v$, $u$ and $w=v+u$ in the following manner, where $w$, the tangent vector, is $u+v$. Their modulus is constant, thus since $v+u$ varies, the variables here are the angles and the modulus. Remember that $v$ always points at $B$. IN the image, the lengths of $v$ and $v_1$ and of $u$ and $u_1$ should be the same (since they're the same vector). You can see that $v$ is ""pushing"" to get to $B$ but the vector $u$ will always modify $v$'s direction (and thus the man's), making the tangent actually be $w = u+v$. The dotted parallel lines are a reference to the tangent angle which is that between the dotted line and $w$. My approach is: $$ \tan \theta = \frac{dy}{dx}$$ and the modulus of $v+u$ will satisfy, being a function of time. $$|| v+u||(t) = \frac{ds}{dt}$$ I just need then to find a way of relating the modulus to the angle to find the solution. Another thing that comes to mind is thinking as the solution in a parametric way, thus first finding $$\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t) $$ and $$\frac{dx}{dt} = g(t) $$ then taking the quotient and integrating.","['analytic-geometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

107156,The Space of Bilinear Forms,"Background Consider the set of all bilinear forms $\text{Bil}_F(X \times Y)$ over finite dimensional vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ with common ground field F. If we choose bases for $(u_1, \dots, u_m)$ for $X$ and $(v_1, \dots , v_m)$ for Y, a basis for the tensor product of $X$ and $Y$ is given by $\{u^i \otimes v^j | i = 1, \dots, m; j=1, \dots n \}$ where $u^i$ and $v^i$ denote the respective dual bases. Now, it is a theorem that the tensor product  $X \bigotimes Y$ is isomorphic to $\text{Bil}_F(X \times Y)$ and  counting the $m \cdot n$ basis elements of  $X \bigotimes Y$ we know that the tensor product is isomorphic to the set of all $m \times n$ matrices over $F$, $\mathcal{M}^m_n(F)$ which also has $m \cdot n$ basis elements and therefore, $\text{Bil}_F(X \times Y) \approx \mathcal{M}^m_n(F)$ Question Now, my question is: Assuming the above argument makes sense, this seems like a lot of technology to prove this isomorphism. Is there a better/more direct way to do this that doesn't involve, for example, constructions such as the tensor product? Attempt I know that there is a unique matrix associated with given bilinear form that has entries determined by $B_{ij} = B(u_i, v_j)$ and this insures that one can, in principle, construct at least an injection between $\text{Bil}_F(X \times Y)$ and $\mathcal{M}^m_n(F)$. Also, given any matrix $A$, the mapping $B(x,y) = x^T A y$ is a bilinear form. It seems that a good candidate for an isomorphism might be
$$
\phi(A)(x,y) = x^T A y
$$

107168,Pigeonhole principle and sequences problem,"Could you please tell me if this is the right approach to tackle this problem.I translated it from Spanish into English, so please excuse the wording and let me know if there's something that is not clear. Problem statement Let $S$ be the set of all sequences $s=(x_1,x_2,...,x_8)$ that are composed of four zeros and four ones. There is a match between two sequences when both have zero or one in the same position. For instance, there are three matches in $(1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0)$ and $(0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1)$, in the following positions: two, four and seven. And also, for each sequence $s$  we consider the following seven sequences: $$s_i=(x_i,x_{i+1},...,x_8,x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_{i-1}),i=2,...,8$$ Prove that there are at least four matches between any sequence $s$ and some of the sequences $s_i$. My approach First of all, I build a table to figure out how $s$ and all the $si$ are related: $$\begin{array}{ccc}
s=x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5x_6x_7x_8\\
s_2=x_2x_3x_4x_5x_6x_7x_8x_1\\
s_3=x_3x_4x_5x_6x_7x_8x_1x_2\\
s_4=x_4x_5x_6x_7x_8x_1x_2x_3\\
s_5=x_5x_6x_7x_8x_1x_2x_3x_4\\
s_6=x_6x_7x_8x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5\\
s_7=x_7x_8x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5x_6\\
s_8=x_8x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5x_6x_7\\
\end{array}$$ We observe that  $x_i$ from $s$ is left-shift seven times in the $s_2,...,s_8$ sequences. This means that $x_i$ will not have a match with itself in any of the $s_i$. However, as $s$ is composed of four zeros and four ones, $x_i$, there are at least three matches of $x_i$ with $s_2,...,s_8$. That is, if $x_i=1$ there are other three ones, and similarly when $x_i=0$. For each $x_i$ there are three matches in $s_2,...,s_8$. As the length of $s$ is eight, there are $8·3=24$ matches in total. As there are seven $s_2,...,s_8$, we use the pigeonhole principle to prove that $\lceil{24 \over 7}\rceil=4$. Therefore there is at least one $si$ that contains four or more matches with $s$.","['pigeonhole-principle', 'discrete-mathematics']"

I guess this is true when $K=\mathbb{Q}_p$ because in the ordinary case the representation is reducible, while in the supersingular case, the representation is irreducible.

107291,The preimage of a maximal ideal is maximal,"I'm having some difficulty with this homework problem: Let $A, B$ be reduced finitely generated $\mathbb{C}$-algebras, and $\psi : A \longrightarrow B$ a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra homomorphism. Let $\mathcal{M} \subset B$ be a maximal ideal. Show that $\psi^{-1}(\mathcal{M})$ is also a maximal ideal. Here's what I have so far. The preimage of a prime ideal under a homomorphism is a prime ideal, so we know $\psi^{-1}(\mathcal{M})$ is a prime ideal. Also, if the homomorphism is surjective, then the image of an ideal is an ideal; but unfortunately we don't know $\psi$ is surjective. So suppose that there is an ideal $\mathcal{J} \subset A$ such that $\mathcal{J} \supsetneq \psi^{-1}(\mathcal{M})$. Then $\psi(\mathcal{J}) \supsetneq \mathcal{M}$. But $\psi(\mathcal{J})$ is not necessarily an ideal, so consider the ideal it generates (which I'll denote $\langle\psi(\mathcal{J})\rangle$ - not sure if this notation is standard). This ideal contains $\mathcal{M}$, and since $\mathcal{M}$ is maximal we have $\langle\psi(\mathcal{J})\rangle = B$. Therefore any $f \in B$ can be written as a linear combination of elements of $B$ with coefficients in $\psi(\mathcal{J})$, and in particular, all of the generators of $B$ can be written this way.

107292,Rapid approximation of $\tanh(x)$,"This is kind of a signal processing/programming/mathematics crossover question.  At the moment it seems more math-related to me, but if the moderators feel it belongs elsewhere please feel free to migrate it. I'm working on a project where I have limited computational power and need to make a speedy approximation of the hyperbolic tangent function over a fairly large range of input arguments. Assuming the numbers are stored in fixed point with an 8 bit fractional part then the approximation to $\tanh(x)$ should work to the limit implied by the resolution, or for arguments  $\tanh^{-1}(\pm[1 - \frac{1}{2^8}]) \approx \pm3.1$.  I know that Taylor series will not converge fast enough over this range, and I haven't fully looked into it but I don't believe that a Chebyshev polynomial approximation will converge rapidly enough either.  For various reasons a table lookup is also not possible. $\tanh(x)$ is algebraically equivalent to $\mathrm{sgn}(x)(1 - \frac{2}{e^{2|x|} + 1})$.  This looks promising; a series expansion of $e^x$ converges better than $\tanh(x)$.  For a rapid numerical calculation on limited hardware the "" + 1"" in the denominator throws a wrench into the works - it means a division has to be carried out, and since many simple processors don't have ""hardware divide"" the division has to be done in software through repeated shifts and subtractions, which is achingly slow. To get around this I'm considering the following approach.  Instead of using $\mathrm{sgn}(x)(1 - \frac{2}{e^{2|x|} + 1})$ to exactly represent tanh(x), define the following similar type of function: $\mathrm{sgn}(x)A(1 - e^{-B|x|})$ for unknown constants A and B.  Then define a loss function: $f(x) = \int_0^{3.1}[\tanh(x) - A(1 - e^{-Bx})]^2dx$ Then use a numerical method (gradient descent?) to find the values of A and B that minimize the loss.  The problem of approximating $\tanh(x)$ rapidly is then converted into approximating $e^{-x}$ rapidly plus an extra subtraction and multiplication. $e^{-x} = \dfrac{1}{e^x} = \dfrac{1}{2^{x \log_2(e)}} = \dfrac{2^{-x}}{2^y}$, where y is the integer part and x is the fractional part.  Expressing $e^{-x}$ this way lets me reduce the range of the input argument; dividing an unsigned number by $2^y$ where y is a positive integer can be accomplished by logical shifting.  For arguments between 0 and -1 just eyeballing a Taylor series expansion of $2^x$ looks pretty good for just 3 terms. Does this approach seem reasonable, from a mathematical perspective? Pitfalls I haven't considered? Thanks for any advice. Edit: I should add that in this application (audio processing) I'm willing to trade off absolute accuracy of the calculated value in exchange for speed of processing and a function that works ""reasonably"" well over the entire range of input arguments - the return value for every argument in the approximation doesn't have to be accurate to the $2^{-8}$ limit implied by the resolution.","['signal-processing', 'trigonometry', 'approximation', 'computational-mathematics', 'numerical-methods']"

This has the advantage of being concrete, but the disadvantage that the local coordinates are usually completely irrelevant- the choice of atlas and chart is arbitrary, and rarely if ever seems to play any role in differential geometry/topology. There is a much better definition of differentiable manifolds, which I don't know a good textbook reference for, via sheaves of local rings . This definition does not involve any strange arbitrary choices, and is coordinate free. Paragraph 3 in Wikipedia (which is the actual definition) states: A differentiable manifold (of class $C_k$) consists of a pair $(M, \mathcal{O}_M)$ where $M$ is a topological space, and $\mathcal{O}_M$ is a sheaf of local $R$-algebras defined on $M$, such that the locally ringed space $(M,\mathcal{O}_M)$ is locally isomorphic to $(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathcal{O})$. This confuses me, because I don't see why such a sheaf should be acyclic, or where conditions like ""paracompact"" or ""complete metric space"" or ""second countable Hausdorff"" are implicit. So either: The wikipedia entry has a mistake (I would want to sanity-check this before editing the entry, because this is such a fundamental definition which thousands must have read). Somewhere in that definition, the condition that $M$ be paracompact is implicit. Question : Should the definition above indeed require that $M$ be second-countable Hausdorff or paracompact or whatever? Or is it somehow implicit somewhere, and if so, where? Also, is this definition given carefully in any textbook? Update : I have editted the Wikipedia article to require that $M$ be second-countable Hausdorff.

The topology induced on $\mathbb{R}$ by restricting open sets of $T^2$ is strictly coarser than the usual order topology on $\mathbb{R}$.  In fact, the basis consists of countable unions of neighborhoods.  The topology has a sort of ""fractal"" feel to it: for any integer $N$, $\epsilon>0$, there exists some $x>N$ with $d(x,0)<\epsilon$.  In fact, for a fixed $\epsilon$, the ball of radius $\epsilon$ about $0$ ""unwraps"" to intervals which, loosely speaking, approach length $2\epsilon$ as one approaches $\infty$.  The spacing of the intervals also seems like it is regular and governed by $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$.  That seems pretty neat to me.

I have done some exercises (using the book of Atiyah / MacDonald) and I will do some more, but a more practical question took my attention. I started with an easy example and considered the ring $k[x]_x$. Localizing at $x$ means that $x$ and its powers become units in the localization. Hence
$$k[x]_x\cong k[x,x^{-1}]\cong k[x,y]/\langle xy-1\rangle,$$
am I right there for a start? Then I wanted to compute the localization of $k[x,y]/\langle xy-1\rangle$ at $\langle x-1,y-1\rangle$. This should be a maximal ideal in the quotient, since $\langle xy-1\rangle\subset\langle x-1,y-1\rangle$. (Geometrically, what does this mean here? The maximal ideal corresponds to the point $p=(1,1)$ on the hyperbola $xy-1=0$, so we ""gather only local information around $p$"" in some way?) Localization commutes with the quotient, thus

Prove that $\int f \; d\mu < \infty$ if and only if $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^n \mu(x \in X : f(x) \geq 2^n) < \infty.$$ I am having trouble thinking of where to begin in proving this result, and wanted to see if anyone visiting had some suggestions on how to proceed.",['measure-theory']
107405,Calculating a Lebesgue integral involving the Cantor Function,"I came across the following challenging problem that concerns evaluating a Lebesgue integral rather than being asked to prove something about it: Let $\varphi: [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$ be the Cantor (ternary) function, and let $m_\varphi$ be the Lebesgue-Stieltjess measure associated to it. Let $f(x) = x$. Evaluate $$\int_{[0,1]} f \; dm_\varphi.$$ A friend of mine suggested that if you study this integral in Mathematica, its value is fairly large, but I am having trouble thinking of how to proceed in computing the value without a computer algebra package. I post this question in hopes that anyone visiting will find the problem curious too, and to see if anyone visiting had some suggestions on how to proceed in computation.",['measure-theory']

107426,Existence of morphism of curves such that field extension degree > any possible ramification?,"Throughout I would like to work over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 (so no separability issues), say $k$. My question is the following: Do there exist two curves $X$ and $Y$ and a necessarily finite morphism $f:X \rightarrow Y$ such that 
$$[k(X):k(Y)] > \text{max}_{P \in X}\{e_P\}$$
where $k(X)$ denotes the function field of $X$ and $e_P$ denotes the ramification index of the map at a point $P \in X$? My thoughts/attempts so far: Hurwitz's Theorem tells us that for a finite separable morphism of curves $f:X \rightarrow Y$ we have
$$2g(X)-2=(\text{deg }f)(2g(Y)-2)+\text{deg }R$$
where $\text{deg }f=[k(X):k(Y)]$, $g(X)$ is the genus of $X$ and $R$ is the ramification divisor. That is, $\text{deg }R=\sum_{P\in X} (e_P-1)$. Using this I can note that a simple example may come from a morphism between two genus 0 curves that gives a field extension of degree 3 and ramifies at 4 points. In this case each ramification index would have to be 2 and hence the condition would be satisfied. I thought I had an example of higher genus using the double cover of the projective line over $k$ by an elliptic curve, however at one of the four points of ramification the index would have to be at least equal to the field extension degree. A related extension to this question is whether it is possible to have such a map that any possible ramification type occurs - that is, given two fixed genus values (necessarily $g(X)\geq g(Y)$ by Hurwitz) and $[k(X):k(Y)]$ fixed, can a morphism be constructed that ramifies at any allowable number of points with indices? Now I do not insist on the ramification indices all being smaller than the degree of the field extension. By allowable here I mean that deg $R$ is controlled by the fixed values by Hurwitz's Theorem, and so the greatest number of ramification points is deg $R$ each with index 2, but other partitions of deg $R$ with integers $\geq 2$ are possible.

107439,Application of Kolmogorov Zero-One Law,"I'm having some trouble with an exercise. 
Suppose $(X_n)_n$ is a sequence of independent r.v with $\mathbb{P}(X_n > x) = e^{-x}$ for positive x and one otherwise. The exercise first asks for what values of $\alpha>0$  is it almost surely the case the $X_n > \alpha \log \ n$ i.o. which I have managed. Then it asks if $L= \limsup_n \frac{X_n}{\log \ n}$ show that $\mathbb{P}(L=1)=1$. So far I can show $\mathbb{P}(L \geq 1)=1$ and now want to show $\mathbb{P}(L > 1)=0$.
