1287321,Lebesgue outer measure with open balls,"I'm not sure if this has been asked before; if so please redirect me to the appropriate question. The Lebesgue outer measure of $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as $$\mu_*(A) = \inf\left\{ \sum_{i} |R_{i}|: A \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} |R_i|, I \,\,\mbox{countable} \right\}$$ where the infimum is taken over open boxes $R_i$. Now suppose we define a new measure in this exact same manner, except we take the infimum over open balls, defining their volume using the usual formula for the volume of an $n$-sphere. Why is this equivalent to the above definition? It seems somewhat related to the Vitali covering lemma.","['lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory']"
1287344,continuous image of a locally compact space is locally compact,Is continuous image of a locally compact space is locally compact? Let $X$ be locally compact(l.c.). Let $f: X\to Y$ be continuous and surjective. A space $X$ is locally compact if for each $x\in X$ such that $\exists $ a  compact set $V$ such that $x\in U\subset V$ for some open set $U$ containing $x$ . To show that $Y$ is locally compact My try: Let $y=f(x)\in Y$ and let $V\subset Y$ be an open set containing $y$ .then $x\in f^{-1}(V)\subset X$ .As $f$ is continuous then $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$ which is locally compact so there exists a compact set $C\subset X$ such that $x\in f^{-1}(V)\subset C\subset X\implies f(x)\subset V\subset f(C)\subset Y$ Now $f(C)$ being continuous image of  a compact set is compact. Thus proved. But the problem is it has been given that only continuity will not do the map has to be open also.

1287350,Fourier transform in three dimensions getting out of hand,"I have the following integral I wish to compute, it transforms a quantum position wave function into momentum space: $$\phi(\mathbf p)=\int\frac{\mathrm d^3r}{(2\pi\hbar)^{3/2}}e^{-i\mathbf{p\cdot r}}\psi(\mathbf r)$$
Where $\psi(\mathbf r)=e^{-|\mathbf r|/a}/\sqrt{\pi a^3}$, the wave equation for the ground state of hydrogen. So I thought about converting it to polar coordinates first then evaluate the integrals, but it turned out to be unexpectedly complicated. Below is my attempt (note, since this is physics related, $\theta$ is swapped with $\varphi$ in polar coordinates): We first rewrite the integral in polar coordinates:
$$\phi(r_p, \varphi_p, \theta_p)=\frac{1}{(2a\hbar)^{3/2}\pi^2}\int_0^\pi\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\infty e^{-i\mathbf{p\cdot x}/h-r_x/a}\mathrm d r_x\mathrm d\varphi_x \mathrm d\theta_x$$ Where the dot product in spherical coordinates is:
$$\mathbf{p\cdot x}=r_xr_p[\sin\theta_p\sin\theta_x\cos(\varphi_p-\varphi_x)+\cos\theta_p\cos\theta_x]$$ Substitute and integrate, we get:
\begin{align*}\phi(r_p, \varphi_p, \theta_p)&=\frac{1}{(2a\hbar)^{3/2}\pi^2ir_p}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi \frac{\mathrm d\theta_x \mathrm d\varphi_x}{\sin\theta_p\sin\theta_x\cos(\varphi_p-\varphi_x)+\cos\theta_p\cos\theta_x}\\
\textrm{Now let: } a &=\sin\theta_p\cos(\varphi_p-\varphi_x)\\
b &=\cos\theta_p \\
\phi&=\frac{1}{(2a\hbar)^{3/2}\pi^2ir_p}\int_0^\pi \frac{\ln(\sqrt{a^2+b^2}-a)-\ln(\sqrt{a^2+b^2}+a)}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}\mathrm d\varphi_x\\
\end{align*} The second integral is evaluated from wolfram alpha. From here I'm quite stuck. The final integral looks rather hopeless. Is there any tricks to Fourier transforms in space or did I make a mistake somewhere? Edit: I think I accidentally substituted $2\pi$ instead of $\pi$, but the correct version is even more complicated.","['fourier-analysis', 'definite-integrals', 'integration']"

1287487,Abstract interpretation of isomorphism between tensor product with dual and hom,"I'm interested in the following statement, coming from Remark 6.4.21 of Qing Liu's Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves : Let $\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G}$ be quasi-coherent sheaves on a scheme $X$. Then we have a canonical homomorphism $\mathcal{F}^\vee \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G})$ which on any affine open subset $U$ sends $\phi \otimes y \in \mathcal{F}^\vee(U) \otimes \mathcal{G}(U)$ to the homomorphism $x \mapsto \phi(x)y$. It is easy to verify that it is an isomorphism if $\mathcal{F}$ or $\mathcal{G}$ is locally free. Here $\mathcal{H}om$ denotes the internal hom functor. My question is how to understand this isomorphism in an abstract sense, by appealing to a map defined in terms of something like a tensor-hom adjunction. Since everything is well-defined in terms of (locally free) sheaves, I'd expect it to be something canonical, i.e. not requiring a choice of basis. (Since even in the case of line bundles, we don't have the isomorphism $\mathcal{L} \simeq \mathcal{L}^\vee$). How should I think about this? EDIT: as the comment by Zhen Lin points out, the map is canonical in that it is choice free. I suppose I'm looking for an abstract characterization of the map as an instance of some more abstract categorical property. In addition, why does the locally free assumption come in? I'm not sure if in this context, locally free means of locally constant rank (i.e. free on some open cover) or just free at every point. The latter seems necessary in order to describe why the map is an isomorphism on stalks, but I don't see why the former would come up.","['algebraic-geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'modules', 'sheaf-theory']"

1287496,Orbit Stabilizer problem (I think),"Let $G$ (finite) act transitively on the nonempty set $\Omega$. Show that if $\alpha \neq \beta$ are elements of $\Omega$ then $G_{\alpha}G_{\beta}$ is a proper subset of $G$, where $G_{\alpha}$ and $G_{\beta}$ are the stabilizers of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in G, respectively. Here's what I've done: Let $\mathcal{O}$ denote the orbit of the elements from $G$ acting on $\Omega$. Then using the orbit stabilizer theorem and the fact that $|G_{\alpha}G_{\beta}| = \frac{|G_{\alpha}||G_{\beta}|}{|G_{\alpha}\cap G_{\beta}|}$ we can deduce that

|G_{\alpha}G_{\beta}|=\frac{|G|^{2}}{|\mathcal{O}|^{2}\cdot |G_{\alpha} \cap G_{\beta}|}.

This would then give that $G_{\alpha}G_{\beta}=\frac{|G|}{\mathcal{O}}$ since $|G_{\alpha}|=\frac{|G|}{\mathcal{O}}$ in which case I could probably make an argument for why $|\mathcal{O}| > 1$.

number $k$ in that segment. And the sum of all the probabilities is $1/n + 1/n
+ \dots + 1/n = n.1/n = 1$, as it should. But something weird happens if we
take the limit for $n \rightarrow \infty$. Then each of the probabilities for
picking one natural number becomes $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} 1/n = 0$$
while the sum of all probabilities is still $1$, according to
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} 1 = 1$$
How can this happen? A bunch of zeroes that sums up to one? Oh well, it's not just a sum of zeroes. It's an infinite sum of zeroes.
But nevertheless. Let's take another example, that seems only remotely resemblant. The following
trivial integral is expressed as the limit of a Riemann sum:
$$
  \int_0^1 dx = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=1}^n 1/n
              = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} n.1/n
              = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} 1 = 1
$$
Am I blind or what? The only difference with the above ""probabilities"" is the
geometrical interpretation. Here come the probabilities. It is a histogram with
height of the blocks $1/n$ and width of the blocks $1$ for $n$ blocks. So the
total area of the blocks is $(n.1.1/n) = 1$ : And here comes the Riemann sum of the trivial integral. The blocks are $1/n$
wide, $1$ high and there are $n$ of them. The total area is $(n.1/n.1) = 1$. Obviously, $\,\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} n.1/n\,$ is exactly the same
algebraic expression with the integral as with our probabilities. But, on the the contrary, it seems that common mathematics has developed quite different
ideas about probabilities. The following is a standard Theorem. Let $X$ be a random variable which assumes values in a countable infinite set
$Q$. We can prove there is no uniform distribution on $Q$ . As follows.
Assume there exists such a uniform distribution, that is, there
exists $a \ge 0$ such that $P(X = q) = a$ for every $q \in Q$ .
Observe that, since $Q$ is countable, by countable additivity of $P$ :
$$
  1 = P(X \in Q)=\sum_{q \in Q} P(X = q) = \sum_{q \in Q}  a 
$$
Observe that if $a = 0$ , $\sum_{q \in Q} a = 0$ . Similarly, if $a > 0$ ,
$\sum_{q \in Q} a = \infty$ . Contradiction. Let's analyze.
The second part of this reasoning is remotely resemblant to the following iterated limit :
$$
  \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} n \left[ \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{m}
  \right] = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} n\; 0 = 0
$$ First
define uniform probabilities. It's easy to see that these will become zero if
the initial segment becomes infinite. Then sum up. Evidently the sum then must be zero as well. Here the variable $m$ has been introduced in order to avoid confusion with the
variable $n$. But maybe this is the cause of the problem. Shouldn't we rather
write:
$$
  \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} n \left[ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{n}
  \right] = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} n\; 1/n = 1 \qquad \mbox{?}
$$

Here a real number $\alpha$ is said to be normal in base $b$ or $b$- normal (where $b > 1$ is an integer) if every sequence of $n$ consecutive digits (for every positive integer $n$) appears in the $b$-ary expansion of $\alpha$ with the same frequency.
Further, a number is said to be absolutely normal if it is normal in every integer base $b > 1$.

I am having difficulty understanding what a stopping time is. The definition I am provided with is as follows:
A random time $τ$ is called a stopping time if for any $n$, one can decide whether the event $\{τ ≤ n\}$ (and hence the complementary event $\{τ > n\}$) has occurred by observing the first n variables $X_1, X_2, . . . , X_n$. We are then given an example:
Time of ruin is a stopping time. $τ = \min\{n : X_n = 0\}$.
$\{τ > n\} = \{X_1 ≥ 0, X_2 ≥ 0, . . . , X_n > 0\}$. I don't quite understand what this is supposed to tell us. random time $τ$ is called a stopping time if for any $n$, one can decide whether the event $\{τ ≤ n\}$ has occurred by observing the first n variables $X_1, X_2, . . . , X_n$ When they say the event $\{ τ \leq n\}$ they are referring to some specific time, are they not? e.g $τ = 1$ or maybe $τ = 4$ as long as $τ \leq n$ Is this correct? So then if we know the event $ \{τ \leq n\}$ has or has not occurred, we can conclude whether the complementary even $τ > n$ has occurred. If this is fine so far, then I have issues with the example. Time of ruin is stopping time, 
  $τ = \min\{n : X_n = 0\}$ Firstly, time of ruin to me means at a point where you have $0$ or a negative balance of some sort of asset (For a gambler, no more money to gamble with, for a business owner, no more cash to pay expenses or obligations) - is this correct? In that case Time of ruin should occur when $X_n \leq 0$, correct? IF that is fine, then continuing, what does $τ = \min\{n : X_n = 0\}$ mean?
 This is not the same as 
$τ = \min\{n,X_n\}$, is it? What is it trying to say?
I read it as, the minimum of $n$, such that $X_n  = 0$ So it's saying $τ$ is the first point at which we are ruined? Is my understanding all correct?

1287877,Show that the average depth of a leaf in a binary tree with n vertices is $ \Omega(\log n)$.,"Let $T$ be a tree with$n$ vertices, having height $h$. If there are any internal vertices in $T$ at levels less than $h — 1$ that do not have two children, take a leaf at level $h$ and move it to be such a missing child. This only lowers the average depth of a leaf in this tree, and since we are trying to prove a lower bound on the average depth, it suffices to prove the bound for the resulting tree. Repeat this process until there are no more internal vertices of this type. As a result, all the leaves are now at levels $h — 1$ and $h$. Now delete all vertices at level $h$. This changes the number of vertices by at most (one more than) a factor of two and so has no effect on a big-Omega estimate (it changes $\log n$ by at most 1). Now the tree is complete, and it has $2^{h-1}$ leaves, all at depth $h — 1$, where now $n = 2^{h-1}$. The desired estimate follows.

This allows us to consider the corresponding subsequence in the ""second component"", which again has a convergent subsequence.

Let $\omega: M \times [0,1]$ be a differential 2-form ( $M$ is a smooth manifold), then I want to transform it into a  1-form on $M$ by a linear map $I : \Omega^2(M \times [0,1]) \rightarrow \Omega^1(M).$ So the idea is somehow to integrate with an operator $I$ over the $[0,1]$ part in order to get the right differential form. First, I notice that each $2-$ form on $M \times[0,1]$ is necessarily of the form 
$\omega = \omega_1 \wedge dt + \omega_2,$ where $\omega_1$ is a 1-form depending only on coordinates of the manifold, $t$ is the coordinate of the interval here and $\omega_2$ is a 2-form depending only on coordinates of $M$. Clearly, by skew symmetry of the wedge product, there cannot be a 2-form with $dt \wedge dt.$ Now, the big question is: How do I define $I(\omega)$ to get the following results; cause I am currently reading some lecture notes (not online unfortunately) where exactly such a construction is used, and it is said that its integration with respect to the $[0,1]$ part, but it is not explicitely mentioned how it is defined, so what this operator explicitly does to a form on $M \times [0,1]$. Altogether, I am looking for an explanation of what this operator $I$ exactly does.
Let me provide you with the calculation given in the notes:
So $\omega_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i(x,t) dx_i,$ where $x_1,...,x_n$ are coordinates of the manifold $M$ and
$\omega_2 = \sum_{i<j} b_{i,j}(x,t)dx_i \wedge dx_j$ Now, it is said that $I(\omega ) = \int_0^1 \omega_{p-1} dt.$ So somehow this operator does not affect $\omega_p$ if I get this correctly(maybe because there is no $dt$).
Furthermore, for $d \omega = d \omega_{p-1} \wedge dt + d \omega_{p}$
which can be written in coordinates as
$$ d\omega_{p-1} \wedge dt= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \partial_{x_j} a_i(x,t) dx_j\wedge dx_i \wedge dt$$ and 
$$d \omega_p = \sum_{i<j} \left(\sum_{k=1}^{n} \partial_{x_k}b_{i,j}(x,t) dx_k \wedge dx_i \wedge dx_j +  \partial_t b_{i,j}(x,t)dt\wedge dx_i \wedge dx_j \right),$$
 we get by linearity $I(d\omega) = I( d \omega_p) + I (d\omega_{p-1}\wedge dt)$ which shall altogether give us:
$d(I(\omega))-I(d\omega) = (-1) (\sum_{i<j} b_{i,j}(x,1)-b_{i,j}(x,0)dx_i\wedge dx_j).$ This is what the lecture notes contain, can we tell from this how $I$ exactly acts on forms on $M \times[0,1]$? Especially, why this operator apparently gives zero, if the form does not depend on $t$ via $dt$, although $a,b$ depend on $t$ in general?

Imagine I was trying to figure out if a supermarket chain took credit as well as cash.  My wife had been to the market yesterday and they didn't take credit.  That leads both of us to believe they won't take credit today (seems like a safe assumption). Assume the following: The supermarket has not announced that they will accept credit soon - nor have they said they wouldn't. For this question - let's say it takes no real time  to implement a credit card system - they could implement it at the drop of a hat. We have no other reasons to think they will or will not decide to do this. The fact that they didn't accept credit yesterday seems to increase the likelihood that they won't today (if we had been there last 1 year ago - we would be less likely to assume that they still didn't take credit cards).  But the fact that she was there yesterday is completely irrelevant to the stores credit card plans.  If they ever choose to implement credit card processing then it will have to happen one day - and that day could be any day - but it still seems we are grounded in our assumption that they won't accept them today. My question is: Does the fact that we knew that they didn't accept credit cards yesterday have any statistical correlation to whether they will accept them today?

1288511,Existence of infinite set and axiom schema of replacement imply axiom of infinity,"I'm self-teaching an intro to set theory course, and came across this exercise: Show that the existence of an infinite set is equivalent to the existence of an inductive set.  For the notion of finiteness without reference to natural numbers, we use the given Tarski definition of finiteness: A set $x$ is finite if, for every non-empty $a\subseteq \mathcal{P}(x)$, there exists a set $b\in a$ that is $\subseteq$-minimal, that is, there is no $c\in a$ such that $c\subsetneq b$.  A set is called infinite if, of course, it is not finite. Now, the right-to-left implication is clear, as it is merely assuming the axiom of infinity and asking to show that there is an infinite set--likely something the author of these notes overlooked, since (of course) the notes up to that point has already established $\omega$ is an infinite set, so only the left-to-right implication needs proving. Before I begin discussing my issue solving the problem, let me state that I've just looked at a view answered questions about ZFC, minus the axiom of infinity or also with the axiom negated.  I haven't seen this specific question, though I've seen it alluded to.  I saw a suggestion to use the axiom of choice due to the well-ordering theorem, but in the notes I'm using the well-ordering theorem has not been proven yet.  Furthermore, I also shouldn't be able to reference ordinals, as the notes haven't defined ordinals yet (this is the next chapter, actually!).  The sequence has been: all of the ZFC axioms, the definition of $\omega$, proofs of the properties of $\omega$ (transitivity, recursive definition, linear ordering by $\in$, etc.) and then the concept of (Tarski) finite sets.  With regards to finiteness, I know that, if $x$ is a finite set, subsets of $x$ are finite, union with a finite set $y$ is finite, surjective image of $x$ is finite, and the power set of $x$ is finite.  Furthermore, we have proven already that every finite set is the bijective image of a natural number and every infinite set contains an injective image of $\omega$.  This is all, of course, assuming the Axiom of Infinity, but I wanted to make sure my allowed tools were known. Now, in my attempt to search for a solution after being stumped, I found another book on set theory that merely said that, assuming the existence of an infinite set, say, $x$, all we need to do is apply the axiom schema of replacement to the set $\mathcal{F}(x)$ of finite sets of $x$.  The specific class function was left unclear, though judging by the alternate definition this book used for finiteness (they switched to existence of bijection with a natural number as the preferred definition), it appears the function they would refer to would be that which sends a finite set to the natural number it is in bijection with.  However, without the axiom of infinity, there is no $\omega$ we can refer to as of yet, and hence no (clear, at least to me) way to inductively show that the ""bijection-to-a-natural"" definition is equivalent to the Tarski definition, which is what the notes I'm using instruct to use.  However, once I construct the desired class function $F$, I know the replacement schema implies that the image of $\mathcal{F}(x)$ under $F$ is a set, and can prove from there that it is inductive. So without $\omega$, how am I to approach defining such a function?  Or alternatively, how do I use AC to prove the existence of $\omega$?  Any hints on this would be amazing.  I would not be content if I had to leave this exercise undone.  Apologies in advance if this is deemed a duplicate.  Thank you.","['infinity', 'elementary-set-theory', 'cardinals']"

1288717,Is it necessary for $A$ to be symmetric with non-zero determinant?,"Today, in a Differential Geometry test, I was asked to prove that: $$S:=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^3: x^TAx+c=0\}$$ where $A$ is a symmetric $3\times 3$ matrix  and $c \in \mathbb{R}$ is a regular surface whenever $\det A \neq 0$ and $c \neq 0$. Talking to a friend, he gave me his resolution: (Let's, first, define: $$f: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$
$$x \mapsto \langle Ax,x\rangle$$ If you assume that $A$ is symmetric, the gradient of $f$ in $p$ is $Ap$. Since $c \neq 0$, we have that if $p \in S$, $p$ must not be $0$. Since $\det A \neq 0$, we have that $Ap$ is not $0$, and therefore the derivative is surjective and every point of $S$ is regular. I gave another solution, where I don't use the fact that $A$ is symmetric and neither the fact that $\det A$ is different than $0$. Therefore, I suspect that there may be something wrong, which I ask of you to verify if that's the case: Solution : The derivative of the map $x \mapsto \langle Ax,x\rangle$ at a point $p$ is the linear map: $$f'(x)=\langle A (~~\cdot~~),p\rangle + \langle Ap,~~\cdot~~\rangle$$ Take a point $p \in S$. We know that $\langle Ap,p\rangle=-c$. We show that the derivative is surjective. For that, since it is a linear functional, it is sufficient to show that it is not the zero functional. But this follows from applying the functional at $p$: $$f'(x)p=2\langle Ap,p\rangle=-2c \neq 0$$","['solution-verification', 'differential-geometry', 'linear-algebra']"
1288769,Can $\sin(\pi/25)$ be expressed in radicals,"I suspect that sin(pi/25) is not expressible in elementary forms in radicals because it is the root of some quintic (or rather cos(pi/25) is). Can anyone prove that that particular quintic has no solution in radicals? I know that (from chebyshev polynomials) if $$u=\cos{\frac{\pi}{25}}$$
then
 $$u\left(16u^4-20u^2+5\right)=\frac{\phi}{2}$$ where $\phi$ is the golden ratio.","['radicals', 'roots', 'trigonometry']"

1288797,"Hölder continuous functions are of 1st category in $C[0,1]$","I'm trying to show that the Hölder continuous functions in $[0,1]$ are a set of first category in $C[0,1]$. Does it suffice to show that they are not an open subset of $C[0,1]$? Let $\varepsilon>0$ and $f\in C[0,1]$ be Hölder. Since each Hölder continuous function is uniformly continuous, does it suffice to show that there is a non-uniformly continuous function in the ball $B_{\varepsilon}(f)\subset C[0,1]$? Can such a function be constructed or can I only prove its existence?","['holder-spaces', 'baire-category', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'general-topology']"

1288831,How to integrate with respect to $x^2$?,"$$\int x\,dx^2$$ I'm having trouble comprehending this question. I can perform substitution, but when I do I come out wrong. Here's how I've happened to handle this: $\int x\,dx^2$ $u=x^2$ $du=2x\,dx$ $dx=\frac {du}{2x}$ $\frac12 \int x\frac{du}{2x}$ $\frac 12\int\frac12\,du$ $\frac u4$ $\frac {x^2}{4}$ It says that it's wrong.
