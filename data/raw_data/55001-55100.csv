591901,Cannot understand some parts of proof for R be a countable union of closed sets,"Im reading chapter9 Category, Real Analysis, Carothers, 1ed, talking about discontinuous functions of metric space. Here is a proof for a theorem that R be a countable union of closed sets,: Baire's theorem involved is,: What is the ""entire open interval""? Is ""$E_n$ contains an interval"" the same as interior of $E_n$ is not empty? if $E_n$ has empty interior, that means complement of $G_n$ has empty interior, then equivalently, this will imply that $G_n$ is dense and make a contradiction here, is that right?

591911,How do I generalize the derivatives / integrals from multivariable calc?,"$\newcommand{\RR}{\mathbb{R}}$
This is a long post, so I'll put the big question right at the top: There's a whole lot of derivative-like and integral-like operations. Are they special cases of some larger derivative/integral? Lots of Derivatives and Integrals , or This Isn't Even My Final Form When I was first introduced to calculus, we learned three kinds of derivatives/integrals of a single-variable function: $$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Symbolic} & \textbf{Type of } f \textrm{ ( or } F \textrm{ )} & \textbf{Output Type} \\ \hline
\textrm{Derivative} & \frac{df}{dx} & \RR \to \RR & \RR \to \RR \\ \hline
\textrm{Indefinite Integral} & \int f~dx & \RR \to \RR & \RR \to (\RR \to \RR) \\ \hline
\textrm{Definite Integral} & \int_a^b f~dx & \RR \to \RR & \RR \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$ But in multivariable, we learned several new types for multivariate functions. $$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textrm{Partial Derivative} & \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} & \RR^n \to \RR & \RR^n \to \RR \\ \hline
\textrm{Gradient} & \nabla f & \RR^n \to \RR & \RR^n \to \RR^n \\ \hline
\textrm{Area/Volume Integral}^\ast & \int_A f~dA & \RR^n \to \RR & \RR \\ \hline
\textrm{Line/Surface Integral}^{\ast\ast} & \int_\gamma f~ds & \RR^n \to \RR & \RR \\ \hline
\textrm{Laplacian} & \nabla^2 f & \RR^n \to \RR & \RR^n \to \RR \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$ When we consider vector-valued functions, we get still more. (little $f$ changed to big $F$ for convention's sake) $$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textrm{Partial Derivative} & \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} & \RR^n \to \RR^m & \RR^n \to \RR^m \\ \hline
\textrm{Area/Volume Integral}^\ast & \int_A F~dA & \RR^n \to \RR^m & \RR^m \\ \hline
\textrm{Line/Surface Integral}^{\ast\ast} & \int_\gamma F~ds & \RR^n \to \RR^m & \RR^m \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$ As for the special case of $n = m$, a vector field, we have additional derivatives/integrals: $$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textrm{Divergence} & \nabla \cdot F & \RR^n \to \RR^n & \RR^n \to \RR \\ \hline
\textrm{Curl} & \nabla \times F & \RR^n \to \RR^n & \RR^n \to \RR^{???} \\ \hline
\textrm{Flux Integral}^\dagger & \int_S F \cdot \hat{n}dS & \RR^n \to \RR^n & \RR \\ \hline
\textrm{Work Integral}^{\dagger\dagger} & \int_\gamma F \cdot d\vec{r} & \RR^n \to \RR^n & \RR \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$ And then there's the Jacobian, which seems like a kind of derivative, but it's between coordinate systems. $^\ast~~$ $A$ must have dimension exactly $n$ $^{\ast\ast}~$ $\gamma$ can take any dimension less than $n$ $^\dagger~~$ $S$ must have dimension $n - 1$ $^{\dagger\dagger}~$ $\gamma$ must have dimension $1$ Observations Derivatives are all functions. Integrals are just scalars/vectors. Except the indefinite integral, but perhaps that doesn't actually belong? Or I guess you could treat them as functions that accept a line/surface/etc. Things That Are Special Cases Of Other Things , aka, Motivation For This Question ""Normal"" derivatives are just partials with $n = 1$. Similarly, definite integrals are area/volume integrals where $n = 1$. Area/volume integrals seems to be a special case of line/surface integrals: when I do a surface integral with $S$ a subset of the $xy$-plane, I get just the equivalent area integral, but I can't verify for higher dimensions. We can 'extend' most operators componentwise for $f : \RR^n \to \RR$ to operators on $f : \RR^n \to \RR^m$. Examples: partial derivative and area/volume/line/surface integrals. Minor Questions (i.e., not the big one at the top, but probably answered by it): What's with the codomain of the curl? For $n = 2$, it's $1$, but for $n = 3$, it's $3$. I assume it doesn't become $5$ at $n = 4$, that seems somehow wrong. It seems to be $\binom{n}{2}$, because rotations occur in a plane, and there are $\binom{n}{2}$ ways to pick $2$ basis vectors to get ""basis planes"". The surfaces for work and flux integrals are fixed at dimensions $1$ and $n - 1$. Are there analogous ones for dimensions in between? If I 'extend' the gradient to a vector-valued function where $m = n$, then I get the Jacobian. But what if $m \ne n$? I can still compute it, but it's not a coordinate transform, nor does it have a determinant. Does this Jacobian-like derivative have any meaning? According to Wikipedia, the Jacobian of $F$ at a point $p$ is ""the best linear approximation of the function $F$ near the point $p$"". EDIT: two of them make sense now! Thanks for reading all this way! I'm sorry about the length; this is something that's bugged me since I learned multivariable, and I can't seem to get it any smaller. If it's too broad, could you just point me in the direction of a helpful textbook?","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"

592001,"Is it always possible to find a $t>0$, such that $\int_{0}^{t}|\sum_{k=1}^{n}\cos kx|dx<C~~~?$","Is it always possible to find a $t>0$, such that $$\int_{0}^{t}|\sum_{k=1}^{n}\cos kx|\,dx<C~~~?$$ where $C$ is independent of $n$. Here is my idea: We know that \begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^{n}\cos kx&=\frac{\sin(n+\frac{1}{2})x}{2\sin\frac{1}{2}x}-\frac{1}{2}\\
&=\frac{\sin nx \cos\frac{1}{2}x+\cos nx\sin\frac{1}{2}x}{2\sin\frac{1}{2}x}-\frac{1}{2}\\
&=\frac{\sin nx\cos\frac{1}{2}x}{2\sin\frac{1}{2}x}+\frac{\cos nx}{2}-\frac{1}{2}

My initial conception was to let $A$ and $B$ be two large circles (as large as necessary) that are extremely close to each other but not tangential.  Then we draw one circle beneath $A$ and $B$ that is tangent to both of them.  Slightly above it and in between the ""AB crevice"" we draw another circle.  Then slightly above that we draw another.  And so on and so forth until all the circles have been drawn.  It seems to me in an intuitive sense that we could draw an infinite number of such circles, but I can$t seem to find a rigorous mathematical expression of this idea.

What I'm thinking: Let $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow S_3$ be a homomorphism.$\mathbb{Z}$ is a cyclic group and thus $\phi(\mathbb{Z})$ is cyclic. However, $S_3$ is not cyclic.

592125,Definition of the Hamiltonian via Legendre transform.,"In my book of classical mechanics ( Mathematical methods of classical mechanics by V.I. Arnold), the Hamiltonian is introduced in this way (my translation): Let us consider the system of equations $\dot p = \partial L /\partial \dot q$ ( $p\in \mathbb R^n$ , $q\in \mathbb R ^n$ , the second member is the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to $\dot q$ ), defined by a Lagrangian that we will suppose convex with respect to the second argument $\dot q$ . [...] By definition, the Legendre transform in $\dot q$ of $L(q,\dot q ,t)$ is a function $H(p)=p\dot q-L(\dot q)$ , where $\dot q$ is given by the relation: $$p=\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q}.$$ Now, my definition of Legendre transform of a function $f:\mathbb R ^n \to \mathbb R $ is: $$g(p)=\sup _{x\in \mathbb R^n} (\langle p,x\rangle-f(x)).$$ I can see that the quoted definition coincides with mine if for example, we suppose that $f$ is a quadratic form $$f(x)=x^T A x,$$ for a positive definite symmetric matrix.
In the general case of a convex $f$ (that, to clarify, here means “definite positive Hessian matrix”), however, I don't see how are we granted that: The maximum is attained at a point $x\in \mathbb R ^n$ (we should at least require that $f$ is coercive right? Counterexample: $f(x)=-\ln x$ ) The equation $p=\partial f / \partial x$ has a unique solution. What are sufficient (or maybe necessary and sufficient) conditions for the above formulas to properly define a function that coincides with the Legendre transform of $L$ ? I've made some progress: Suppose that $f:\mathbb R ^n \to \mathbb R$ has a positive definite hessian matrix $f''(x)$ for all $x$ . Also suppose that $$\lim _{|x|\to \infty } \frac{f(x)}{|x|} = \infty .$$ Then the transform $f^*$ exists and is given by $$f^*(p)=\left\langle p,\xi (p)\right\rangle-f(\xi (p)),$$ where $\xi$ is the inverse of $f'$ . In fact, if the limit holds, one can easily see that $G_p (x) = f(x)-\left\langle x,p\right\rangle$ is coercitive and admits a minimum in $\mathbb R ^n$ , that corresponds to $-f^*(p)$ . At this point, the derivative vanishes, so $f'(x)=p$ (this also proves that $f'$ is surjective). Finally, since $f''>0$ , $f'$ is injective and has an inverse $\xi$ and the Legendre transform is as said above.","['classical-mechanics', 'transformation', 'functional-analysis']"
592191,Uniqueness of integral curves.,"Suppose we have a smooth compact manifold $M$ with boundary and a vector field $X$ on $M$. The maximal integral curves on $M$ are unique and hence their images give a partition of $M$. Let $p\in M$ be a point in $M$, such that $X(p)=0$. The constant curve at $p$ fulfills the conditions on an integral curve and hence it is the unique maximal integral curve starting at $p$. This shows that the zero set of the vector field is in one-to-one correspondence to the constant maximal integral curves, right? Now come my confusion: For sure there are vector fields $X$ with isolated zero-points, such that some inetgral curves of a point non zero $q$ runs in the direction of a zero point $p$. (Think of a gradient-like vector field for a morse function.) By the thoughts above, this curve cannot run into $p$, as the integral curve of the zero point is constant and unique, so my conclusion is, that the curve going to the $p$ has to stop right before $p$. But as $M$ is compact, integral curves are defined on the whole real line, so this tastes like a contradiction.

592373,How to identify surfaces of revolution,"Given a surface $f(x,y,z)=0$, how would you determine whether or not it's a surface of revolution, and find the axis of rotation? The special case where $f$ is a polynomial is also of interest. A few ideas that might lead somewhere, maybe: (1) For algebra folks: Surfaces of the form $z = g(x^2 + y^2)$ are always surfaces of revolution. I don't know if the converse is true. If it is, then we just need to find a coordinate system in which $f$ has this particular form. Finding special coordinate systems that simplify things often involves finding eigenvalues. You use eigenvalues to tackle the special case of quadric surfaces, anyway. (2) For differential geometry folks: Surfaces of revolution have a very special pattern of lines of curvature. One family of lines of curvature is a set of coaxial circles. I don't know if this property characterizes surfaces of revolution, but it sounds promising. (3) For physicists & engineers: The axis of rotation must be one of the principal axes for the centroidal moments of inertia, according to physics notes I have read. So, we should compute the centroid and the inertia tensor. I'm not sure how. Then, diagonalize, so eigenvalues, again. Maybe this is actually the same as idea #1. (4) For classical geometry folks: What characterizes surfaces of revolution (I think) is that every line that's normal to the surface intersects some fixed line, which is the axis of rotation. So, construct the normal lines at a few points on the surface (how many??), and see if there is some line $L$ that intersects all of these normal lines (how?). See this related question . If there is, then this line $L$ is (probably) the desired axis of rotation. This seems somehow related to the answers given by Holographer and zyx. Why is this is interesting/important? Because surfaces of revolution are easier to handle computationally (e.g. area and volume calculations), and easy to manufacture (using a lathe). So, it's useful to be able to identify them, so that they can be treated as special cases. The question is related to this one about symmetric surfaces , I think. The last three paragraphs of that question (about centroids) apply here, too. Specifically, if we have a bounded (compact) surface of revolution, then its axis of rotation must pass through its centroid, so some degrees of freedom disappear. If you want to test out your ideas, you can try experimenting with
$$
f(x,y,z) = -6561 + 5265 x^2 + 256 x^4 + 4536 x y - 1792 x^3 y + 2592 y^2 + 
 4704 x^2 y^2 - 5488 x y^3 + 2401 y^4 + 2592 x z - 1024 x^3 z - 
 4536 y z + 5376 x^2 y z - 9408 x y^2 z + 5488 y^3 z + 5265 z^2 + 
 1536 x^2 z^2 - 5376 x y z^2 + 4704 y^2 z^2 - 1024 x z^3 + 
 1792 y z^3 + 256 z^4
$$
This is a surface of revolution, and it's compact. Sorry it's such a big ugly mess. It was the simplest compact non-quadric example I could invent. If we rotate to a $(u,v,w)$ coordinate system, where
\begin{align}
u &= \tfrac{1}{9}( x - 4 y + 8 z) \\
v &= \tfrac{1}{9}(8 x + 4 y + z)  \\
w &= \tfrac{1}{9}(-4 x + 7 y + 4 z)
\end{align}
then the surface becomes
$$
u^2 + v^2 + w^4 - 1 = 0
$$
which is a surface of revolution having the $w$-axis as its axis of rotation.","['geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'surfaces']"

All elements in $B$ are used. Thus, the function $f (x) = 3x - 4$ is onto where $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Here we can get all real values of $f(x)$ for real values of $x$. So, this function is an onto function. For the function $f (x) = x^2 - 2$, $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we can not get values of $f(x)$ smaller than -2. Here, even if we try with all real values of $x$, it is not possible to get all real values for $f(x)$. Hence, this function is not onto. As you can see, the methods I am following in drawing a conclusion are
mostly empirical ones. Is there is fixed methodology I can follow when I am given an arbitrary function and I need to determine whether the given function is onto.

How we know that $\eta < \kappa$ and $(\alpha,\beta)<_{cw} (0, \eta) $ and hence $h: \mu \to \eta \times \eta$ is injective? Appreciate if anyone could advise. Here is an excerpt of the proof: For an infinite ordinal $\kappa,$ the canonical well-ordering of $\kappa \times \kappa,$ denoted by $<_{cw}$ is defined as follows: $(\alpha_1, \beta_1)<_{cw} < (\alpha_2, \beta_2)$ iff either one of the following holds. $(1): \max\{\alpha_1,\beta_1\} < \max\{\alpha_2,\beta_2\}$ $(2): \max\{\alpha_1,\beta_1\} =\max\{\alpha_2,\beta_2\}$ and $\alpha_1<\alpha_2$ $(3): \max\{\alpha_1,\beta_1\} =\max\{\alpha_2,\beta_2\}$ and $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$ and $\beta_1 < \beta_2.$ Claim: For all infinite cardinals $\kappa, (\kappa \times \kappa, <_{cw}) \cong (\kappa, \in).$ Proof: (It has been show that it is true for $\kappa = \omega$) Assume there is a counterexample  $\kappa.$ Let $A= \{\lambda \in \kappa + 1| \lambda\geq \omega \ is \ a \ cardinal \ and \ (\lambda \times \lambda, <_{cw}) \not\cong (\lambda, \in)\}.$ Then, $\kappa \in A.$ Let $\mu$ be least element of $A.$ Thus, $\mu > \omega$ and for all $\lambda,$ if $\omega \leq \lambda < \mu$ and $\lambda$ is a cardinal, then $(\lambda \times \lambda, <_{cw}) \cong (\lambda, \in).$ By Comparability theorem, $(\mu, \in)$ is isomorphic to initial segment of $(\mu \times \mu, <_{cw})$ since $|\mu \times \mu| \geq \mu$ and $\mu$ is cardinal. Let $(\alpha, \beta) \in \mu \times \mu$ such that $(\mu, \in)$ is isomorphic to initial segment of $(\mu \times \mu, <_{cw})$ given by $(\alpha, \beta).$ Let $h$ be the isomorphism.

592564,Proof/Disproof of property of perpendicular lines in the Fibonacci grid,"In my struggle to try to make progress on this question , I am trying to find a proof or counterexample of the following, stronger, statement: Denote by $K$ the subset of the Gaussian integers such that the real and imaginary parts are Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $K = \{ x+iy\; |\; x,y \in \Bbb{F} \}$, where $\Bbb{F}$ is the set of (positive) Fibonacci numbers. Now, $f_1, f_2 \in K$ are such that $\mathrm{Re}\;f_1 > \mathrm{Re}\;f_2$ and $\mathrm{Im}\;f_2 > \mathrm{Im}\;f_1$. This ensures that the line $L_1$ from $f_1$ to $f_2$ has a negative slope in the complex plane. What I want to prove/disprove is this: Draw a line, denoted $L_2$, perpendicular to $L_1$ starting from $f_1$. Then, no matter how long $L_2$ is, it will never contain any point in the set $K$. The figure shows an example where $f_1 = 2+i$ and $f_2 = 1+5i$. Will the line $L_2$ ever hit another red dot no matter how long you go (to the right)? There is one obvious counterexample: If $f_1 = 2+i$ and $f_2 = 1+2i$, $L_2$ will go through the point $3+2i$. This corresponds to the 45-degree case in the question I linked to above, which is a tilted square with the coordinates $2+i, 1+2i, 2+3i, 3+2i$. Another counterexample is the square $(3+i,1+3i,5+3i,3+5i)$ Are there any others? If there aren't, I think the linked question is resolved. Here is what I have done so far: The line $L_1$ has the same slope as the vector $f_2 - f_1$. Rotating this vector 90 degrees clockwise corresponds to a multiplication by $-i$. This will give the following expression for $L_2$ (parametrized by $k$): $$L_2 = f_1 + k(-i)(f_2 - f_1) = f_1(1+ki)-kf_2i$$ Using $f_1 = x_1 + iy_1$ and $f_2 = x_2 + iy_2$ we get $$L_2 = (x_1 + iy_1)(1+ki) - k(x_2 + iy_2) = \underbrace{x_1+k(y_2-y_1)}_{= x_k} + i\underbrace{\left(y_1+k(x_1-x_2)\right)}_{=y_k}$$ Denote the real and imaginary parts of $L_2$ by $x_k$ and $y_k$ respectively. Now, the hypothesis is that there are no $k$ such that $x_k$ and $y_k$ are simultaneously Fibonacci numbers. I don't know if it's useful, but identifying the real and imaginary parts gives $$y_k(y_2-y_1)+x_k(x_2-x_1) = y_1(y_2-y_1)+x_1(x_2-x_1)$$ This is about as far as I have got. There are certain properties of the Fibonacci sequence that may be useful, such as the fact that every $k^{\text{th}}$ number of the sequence is a multiple of $F_k$, but I haven't been able to make use of it.","['fibonacci-numbers', 'geometry', 'euclidean-geometry']"

$\Var\left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n \Var(X_i)$
Then $\Var(X_i)=pq \:\forall i$ (with standard notation), because of the identical distributed variables, hence :  $\Var\left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right) = npq$. 
But by using first the argument of identically distributed variables, we have :

This understanding excluded the case of different formulas on different intervals, so that functions could not be defined ""in pieces"" "". (They then go on to make some generalizations about problems with distinguishing between a function and its values and the difficulty with interpreting the phrase ""rule of correspondence"") I find this statement unconvincing for 2 reasons: first, we commonly define piecewise functions (like signum for example), and nobody really has any trouble understanding what is meant by this. Secondly, it seems like whenever I try to work a proof using the definition of a function as a relation, it seems much more difficult and complicated. Are there applications or maybe areas of math one encounters later, where it is genuinely useful to view functions from this point of view, or is this more like a ""Bourbaki"" definition for purists. The only case I can see where this definition is actually useful at the level of math I'm studying is if I simply want to draw a graph of some general function (without a formula) and claim it is a function (b/c it is a subset of the Cartesian plane, which by observation, I can see passes the vertical line test).

The idea is we define an outer measure (on all subsets) $\lambda^*$ by \begin{equation}\lambda^*(E)=\operatorname{inf} \Sigma\lambda(A_j),\end{equation}
where the $\operatorname{inf}$ is taken over all countable coverings of $E$ using sets in $\mathcal{A}$. Then one shows that the collection of subsets satisfying the Caratheodory condition \begin{equation}\lambda^*(E)=\lambda^*(E\cap A)+\lambda^*(E\backslash A)\end{equation} for all $E$ forms a $\sigma$-algebra, say $\mathcal{A}^*$, and $\lambda^*$ restricted to this $\mathcal{A}^*$ is actually a measure. So my question is, how much larger is this $\mathcal{A}^*$ than $\mathcal{A}$? We know $\mathcal{A}^*$ contains $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$, the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{A}$, and it contains all the null sets. But can it be even larger than this? In case of the Lebesgue measure, we start with the algebra of all 'boxes' then ended up of the Lebesgue measurable sets, which are in turn union of sets from $\sigma$(boxes) and null sets. So the difference of $\mathcal{A}^*$ and $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$ is exactly the null sets. But can $\mathcal{A}^*$ be significantly larger than $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$?

593023,Necessity of a hypothesis in the fundamental theorem of calculus,"Baby Rudin's Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Theorem 6.21), in my professor's words,states: Let $f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a Riemann integrable function. If $F: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is an antiderivative of $f$, then $\int_a^b \! f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = F(b)-F(a)$. During the proof, one of my peers asked if the hypothesis that $f$ is Riemann integrable was needed since we have right after that the derivative of $F$ is little $f$. That is, does the second hypothesis imply the first? $F$ is differentiable, so it's continuous on $[a,b]$, and furthermore bounded. Does this then imply that $f$ is also continuous and bounded? If it does, that mean we can exclude the first hypothesis, or is necessary?","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"

  Show that if $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is decreasing and bounded on $\mathbb{R}$, then the limits $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x)$ both exist. Caution: While this claim is clearly related to the theorem that bounded monotone sequences always converge, it is not an immediate corollary of it.
  You will have to use the definition of the limit directly. (Original picture of the problem here .) My proof: Let $ S = \{f(x) | x \in \mathbb{R} \} $, since $f$ is bounded this set has both an infimum and supremum. (Is this true? I tried to prove it, but have no idea as it seems fairly obvious.) Now, I claim that $\lim_{x\to \infty} f(x) = \inf(S) = L$. By definition, given $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $K \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x>K \implies |f(x) - L| < \epsilon$. Now since $f(x) \geq L$ by definition of the infimum, choose $x_1$ such that $f(x_1) < L + \epsilon$ for $x_1 > K$. But since $f$ is a decreasing function we have $f(x) \leq f(x_1)$, and thus
$$
  L - \epsilon < L \leq f(x) \leq f(x_1) < L + \epsilon
$$
which proves our claim. I use a similar argument for the supremum. Could anyone help me out on making this more rigorous as I feel as though I've skipped some steps.","['supremum-and-infimum', 'analysis']"

My approach is that I know that if $f(x)$ is irreducible then $ < f(x) > $ is a prime ideal. So, if I factor $x^2+1$ into $(x+i)(x-i)$ then those are irreducible factors in $C[x,y]$. And $y+3$ is also irreducible over $C[x,y]$. So then the prime ideals that contain $I$ should be:
$< x+i, y+3 >$
$< x-i, y+3 >$ Is this true? Can I say that $< x-i, y+3 >$ is prime because $f(x,y) = (x-i) + (y+3)$ is irreducible over $C[x,y]$ or how do I motivate that? I'm kind of unfamiliar with working with ideals in two variabels, and ideals generated by two elements, so I'm not quite sure how I can use the theorems that I know from one-variable. I also don't know how I can show that these ideals are also maximal. Since $C[x,y]$ is not a PID then I can't draw the conclusion that just because the ideals are prime that they are also maximal. Also, just for verification that I understood it right. The elements of the ideal $I=< x^2 + 1, y + 3 >$ are all elements of the form $f(x,y) \times (x^2+1) + g(x,y)\times(y+3)$.

My solution We know that $rank((A-\lambda I)^{i-1})-rank((A-\lambda I)^i) =$ number of blocks corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$ of order that is at most i. $rank((A-3I)^0) - rank(A-3I) = rank(I_6)-4=6-4=2$ So there are 2 blocks corresponding to the eigenvalue $3$ and we know that there is a block sized 2x2 corresponding to the eigenvalue $3$ because that is the exponent of $3$ in the minimal polynomial.

Given $\epsilon > 0 $ choose $\delta > 0$ such that: $\vert f(t)- f(x_o) \vert < \epsilon $ if $\vert t- x_0 \vert < \delta$, and  $a \leq t \leq b $.Hence, if $x_0 - \delta < s \leq x_0 \leq t < x_0 + \delta$ $\enspace$ with:  $a\ \leq s < t \leq b$ we have by theorem 6.12(d) $\left| \frac{F(t) - F(s)}{t-s} - f(x_0) \right| = \left| \frac{1}{t-s} \int_s^t [f(u) - f(x_0)]du \right| < \epsilon$ it follows that $F'(x_0) = f(x_0)$","['integration', 'real-analysis']"

Take as an example probably the simplest one, $X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(1/2;x)$ and $Y \sim U(0,1)$. If one thinks of this, $Z$ has probability $1/2$ of being between zero and 1 and same probability of being between one and two. Thus one could say immediately that $Z \sim U(0,2).$ The way I have seen this done elsewhere involves the use of a distribution called Dirac delta function $\delta(x)$, which is zero everywhere else except at zero but the integral over all reals is $1$. Using this, we can make $\text{Bernoulli}(1/2;x)$ a continuous distribution, namely $$\text{DeltaBernoulli(1/2;x)} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(1/2;x)\delta(x)+\text{Bernoulli}(1/2;x)\delta(x-1).$$ (Subquestion: is this convolution of the two distributions or something else?)

I needed to prove for all $n \ge 1$: $$1^3+2^3+3^3+...+n^3\le \frac{(n+1)^4}{4}$$ By the hypothesis I know that $$1^3+2^3+3^3+...+n^3+(n+1)^3\le \frac{(n+1)^4}{4}+(n+1)^3$$ So what I finally need to prove is that $$\frac{(n+1)^4}{4}+(n+1)^3 \le \frac{(n+2)^4}{4}$$","['inequality', 'algebra-precalculus']"

593433,Coin probability question,"Question: Suppose that we flip a coin until either it comes up tails twice or we have flipped six times. What is the expected number of times we flip the coin? I thought the answer was 4 because if it was a fair coin and we wanted tails to come out twice, we would flip it 4 times and it should come out twice as tails. But when I was trying to check the answer I found this: luke's answer . Here is the method that he used to get the answer: P(N=2) = P(TT) = 1/4

P(N=3) = P(HTT , THT) = 2/8

P(N=4) = P(HHTT;HTHT;THHT) = 3/16

P(N=5) = 4/32

P(N=6) = 1 - 1/4 - 2/8 - 3/16 - 4/32 = 3/16

E(N) = 2x1/4 + 3x2/8 + 4x3/16 + 5x4/32 + 6x3/16 = 15/4 = 3.75 Why is this correct? For E(N), why are each of the probabilities multiplied by their respective N? (Why is 1/4 multiplied by 2?)","['discrete-mathematics', 'probability']"
593435,Proof of the denumerability of $\mathbb{Z}$,"I know I could just look this up, but I thought I'd just ask because I like this site and I get feedback. To prove a set is denumerable we have to show there exists a bijection from the set in question.  So to show that $\mathbb{Z}$ is denumerable, we just need a bijection $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$. I thought of such a bijection, namely, $f(n)=(-1)^{n}\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor$.

It would be more helpful to me if you gave me a general suggestion rather than a specific one. Such as how to find the dominating function for integrals which become tidal waves as $n \rightarrow \infty$ or how to chose the point to split the integral into two bits.

593466,Complex exponent properties?,"Here is a line in a proof in a complex analysis text: $\sqrt{1-z^2}=\sqrt{1-z}\sqrt{1+z}$ I know you can't do this in general, but when can you do it? Here is what I tried: $\sqrt{1-z^2}=e^{1/2\log(1-z^2)}=e^{1/2\log((1-z)(1+z))}$ which, at this point, I would like to say is: $e^{1/2(\log(1-z)+\log(1+z))}$? But I don't believe this can necessarily be done either. And so my question of when it's okay seems like it will depend on what branch/argument I give log. If I choose the branch of log to be $(-\infty,0]$ then $\sqrt{1-z^2}$ only has issues on $[1,\infty)$ and $(-\infty,-1]$.  So if I was on a domain that avoided these intervals, say the open unit disc...would I be able to do what I want with spitting the square root? My reasoning is this: If $arg(z) \in (0,\pi)$, then $arg(-z) \in (-\pi,0)$, and thus $arg(1+z) \in (0,\pi)$ and $arg(1-z) \in (-\pi,0)$.  Thus the sum of the two arguments individually is in $(-\pi,\pi)$. Since $arg(1-z^2) \in (-\pi,\pi)$, this value must equal the sum the two individually. (Since it is well known the identity works mod $2\pi$).","['branch-cuts', 'logarithms', 'complex-analysis']"
593473,Finding aggregate score from incomplete data,"$$
\begin{align}
n & = \text{number of reviews}\\
x & = \text{review score}\\
\bar{x} & = \text{aggregate score}
\end{align}
$$ I have a specified number of reviews for a product, I have the review scores themselves, and I want to calculate the average. $$\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \dots + x_n}{n} = \bar{x}$$ This is how I would find the average/aggregate score given all of the individual review scores. What if I have incomplete data. Say I only know the number of reviews ($n$), the latest review ($x$), could I calculate the aggregate accurately provided only those two bits of information? $$\frac{\bar{x}_\text{old} \cdot n_\text{old} + x}{n_\text{new}} = \bar{x}_\text{new}$$ Is this right? Sorry I'm not sure how best to articulate my question. I'm trying to implement a review scoring system for my business website and instead of keeping SQL records of every single review ever made, I'd like to save space/query time and just keep track of $n$ and $\bar{x}$. For example: Review Scores = 4, 2, 5, 3, 6, 7
Number of Reviews = 6
Average = 4.5 If a new review with a score of 5 happens, the average using the first equation yields $4.571$, but I don't want to keep record of every review. Using the second formula gives $4.571$ as well, but I'm working with small $n$; is this method accurate beyond as well? tl;dr: $$\frac{\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+\dots+x_n}{n} \cdot n+x_{n+1}}{n+1} = \frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+\dots+x_n+x_{n+1}}{n+1} = \bar{x} ?$$","['statistics', 'computer-science', 'algebra-precalculus']"
593478,How to determine that a surface is symmetric?,"Given a surface $f(x,y,z)=0$, how could you determine that it's symmetric about some plane, and, if so, how would you find this plane. The special case where $f$ is a polynomial is of some interest. The question is somewhat related to this one: How to identify surfaces of revolution Here's a simple 2D example to experiment with:
$$
27 x^3 + 108 x^2 y + 144 x y^2 + 64 y^3
         - 80 x^2 + 120 x y  -   45 y^2 - 200 x   + 150 y - 125 = 0$$
This one is symmetric, as the following picture suggests: In fact, if we do the translation/rotation described by the substitution $u = \tfrac15(3x+4y)$, $v = \tfrac15(4x−3y) + 1$, then the curve is just $u^3 - v^2 = 0$, which is obviously symmetric about the line $v=0$. But how would you discover this translation/rotation if I didn't tell you, and how would you do similar things in the 3D surface case? Added after a few days of thought: We can consider the surface as an object made of thin sheet metal. As such, it has a center of mass, provided it's bounded, and any plane(s) of symmetry must pass though this center of mass. The plane then has only two remained degrees of freedom, so may be easier to find. The same sort of reasoning applies in the case of a bounded 2D curve. Again, any line of symmetry must pass through the curve's centroid, so it has only one remaining degree of freedom, namely its slope/angle. For curves and surfaces given by implicit equations, I don't really know how to calculate centroids, but I expect this can be done. Fabricated from Comments Below: Several people suggested looking at highest-degree terms only. So, in my example, we just look at the equation
$$
27 x^3 + 108 x^2 y + 144 x y^2 + 64 y^3 = 0
$$
Putting $w = y/x$, this is roughly equivalent to
$$
64w^3 + 144w^2 + 108 w + 27 = 0
$$
But the polynomial on the left is just $(4w + 3)^3$, so we have a root $w = -3/4$, with multiplicity three. Is the repeated root an accident that happens only in this case, or will it always happen?? Anyway, the vector $(-4,3)$ gives us the normal to the line of symmetry, and that surely can not be an accident. I don't really understand why this magic process works, but it looks very promising for the 2D curve case. I don't know how to generalize to the 3D surface case, or to non-polynomial cases.","['geometry', 'surfaces', 'polynomials']"
