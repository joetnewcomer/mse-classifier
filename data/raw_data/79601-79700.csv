1024329,Convolution of convex polygons and a Gaussian,"I need to find the closest solutions for convolution of convex polygons/circles with a Gaussian function for computer graphics purposes. I was only able to find solutions for rectangles, like this unit square example: $$
f(x,y) = \theta (1+x) \theta (1-x) \theta (1+y) \theta (1-y) \\
g(x,y) = e^{-x^2-y^2} \\
(fâˆ—g)(x,y) = \frac{1}{4} \pi  \left(\text{erf}(1-x)+\text{erf}(1+x)\right) \left(\text{erf}(1-y)+\text{erf}(1+y)\right)
$$ The result being exactly what I'm looking for with rectangles. However I can't find a solution with a sphere defined as $f(x,y) = 1-\theta \left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-r\right)$ with $r$ as the radius. When I use $\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\mathcal{F}(f)\cdot\mathcal{F}(g)\right)$ in Mathematica it runs for about 2 hours before MathKernel actually crashes. If run separately $\mathcal{F}(f)$ takes about half an hour and gives a pretty long result. I'd like to find an exact answer to the sphere convolution, though I can still approximate it using something like:
$$h(x,y) = \frac{1}{2} \left(1-\text{erf}\left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-r\right)\right)-\frac{1}{2} \left(1-\text{erf}\left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}+r\right)\right)$$ So the real problem I need to solve is for triangles and generally for non-rectangular convex polygons. Here's an example of a triangle made from rotated Heaviside step functions mutiplied together: $$
f(x,y) = \theta(x\cos(a_0)-y\sin(a_0)+1) * \theta(x\cos(a_1)-y\sin(a_1)+1) * \\\theta(x\cos(a_2)-y\sin(a_2)+1)
$$
with for instance $a_0=1, a_1=3, a_2=5$. Again Mathematica has been of little help here, and I know that approximating the solution using rotated error functions multiplied together gives very wrong results (mostly when the Gaussian is large wrt the whole triangle or with very obtuse or acute angles), so I have no idea what I can do. Edit: I am now mostly just interested in a solution for triangles, or even just a single corner of a triangle, that would be a good start.","['convolution', 'geometry', 'calculus']"
1024356,Can a function that satisfies the condition $f''(x) = a \cos f(x) $ and $(f'(x))^2 = b \sin f(x)$ be found?,"Can I find a function that satisfies the following conditions?

Also, for simplicity purposes we will let $a=b=1$) So: Squaring both and adding because I noted that $y''$ and $(y')^2$ are on the unit circle therefore resulting in: $$(y'')^2 + (y')^4 = 1$$ By using the chain rule to get 
$$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{d(y')}{dy} \frac{dy}{dx} \\

\iff y' \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\sin y}} \cos y = \cos y \\
\iff \int \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\sin y}} dy = x + c $$ Dividing $(1)$ and $(2)$ where $y' \neq 0$:
$$- \frac{y''}{(y')^2} = - \cot y \iff \bigg (\frac{1}{y'} \bigg )' = - \cot y$$ Combine the new equations that were derived to get $(y'')^2 + (4 \sin y)^2 = 1$ and $\frac {d} {dx} (\frac{1}{2 \sqrt { \sin y}}) = - \cot y$",['ordinary-differential-equations']
1024357,Triple Integrals Problem,"Find the volume formed by $x^2+y^2=9$, $z=0$, and $y=3z$. I am having trouble with determining the limits of integration. $x^2+y^2=9$ describes a circle centered at the origin with a radius of $3$.

1024397,What does it take to divide by $2$?,"Theorem 1 [ZFC, classical logic]: If $A,B$ are sets such that $\textbf{2}\times A\cong \textbf{2}\times B$, then $A\cong B$. That's because the axiom of choice allows for the definition of cardinality $|A|$ of any set $A$, and for $|A|\geq\aleph_0$ we have $|\textbf{2}\times A|=|A|$. Theorem 2 : Theorem 1 still holds in ZF with classical logic. This is less trivial and explained in Section 5 of Division by Three - however, though the construction does not involve any choices, it does involve the law of excluded middle. Question: Are there intuitionistic set theories in which one can prove $$\textbf{2}\times A\cong \textbf{2}\times B\quad\Rightarrow\quad A\cong B\quad\text{?}$$ For example, is this statement true in elementary topoi or can it be proved in some intuitionistic type theory?

1024423,When is a quotient by closed equivalence relation Hausdorff,"Let us say for an arbitrary topological space $X$ that it has property $\dagger$ if for any closed equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$ (closed as a subset of $X^2$), the quotient space $X/{\sim}$ is Hausdorff. Is there a more ""intrinsic"" characterisation of property $\dagger$ (in terms of separation axioms of some sort, perhaps)? I believe compact (possibly non-Hausdorff) spaces have $\dagger$, as in their case for a closed $\sim$, the quotient map is closed, and consequently the product $X^2\to (X/{\sim})^2$ is also closed (and sends $\sim$ to the diagonal). On the other hand, it is easy to see that if $X$ is Hausdorff and has this property, then it must be normal: otherwise the equivalence relation that identifies all points in two supposedly inseparable closed sets (separately) and leaves all others untouched will be closed will have a non-Hausdorff quotient. (As a side note, this is true for arbitrary (not neccessarily Hausdorff) topological groups if we restrict $\sim$ to be the relation of lying in the same coset of a subgroup, because the quotient map is open in this case.) Edit : I've been looking for some references about group actions and stumbled upon a ""Lemma"" in Duistermat and Kolk's ""Lie groups"" book which states that $M/{\sim}$ is Hausdorff iff $\sim$ is closed. This is not true (as shown by the above example in a non-$T_4$ space) and I believe I see the mistake made by the authors (they seem to have assumed that the quotient mapping is open), but it has reminded me of this question (about which I'm still curious).","['general-topology', 'quotient-spaces', 'separation-axioms']"

four cards of the same kind (four of a kind) in a standard $52$ card deck $$_ _ _ _ _$$ Now: First card: Can be any card so probability is 1 Second card: The second card has to be the same rank as first one, and since there are only 4 cards of that rank in a deck and one has already been used in the first card then there is a probability of $\frac{3}{51}$ of picking a second card same as the first Third card: Similarly the third card has probability $\frac{2}{50}$ of being chosen since there are only two cards of the rank we want left Fourth card: Similarly the fourth card has probability $\frac{1}{49}$ of being chosen since there are is only one card of the rank we want left in those 49 cards left Fifth card: The fifth card can be any of the 48 cards left so $\frac{48}{48}=1$ Now this 5 cards can be ordered in $P(5,5)=120 \text{ ways}$ So the $P(\text{four_of_a_kind})=1\cdot \frac{3}{51} \cdot \frac{2}{50} \cdot \frac{1}{49} \cdot 1 \cdot 120$ Which is wrong.

1024477,The Cosine and an Enigmatic Parabola,"In the interval $[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$, the cosine function superficially resembles an inverted parabola of the form $-ax^2+1$: I wanted to know more and computed the $L^2$ norm (surrounding square root omitted for readability): $$
\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \,(\cos(x)-(ax^2+1))^2\,dx \quad=\quad \frac{\pi^5 a^2}{80}+\frac{1}{6}(48-6\pi^2+\pi^3) a+\frac{3\pi}{2}-4
$$ Minimizing the expression on the right hand side with respect to $a$ yields the enigmatic solution $$a=\frac{-20\pi^3+120\pi^2-960}{3\pi^5}=-0.431...$$ which indeed shows a nice agreement: Thus, the parabola $ax^2+1$ with this value for $a$ is in some sense the best parabolic approximation to the cosine in the largest interval in which the cosine is concave like the parabola is. By now you have probably guessed my question: What is going on? I don't know what I expected the optimum value of $a$ to look like, but this is definitely not it.

$\varepsilon$, but I'm not sure that would really work since we only have an arbitrary function with arbitrary bounds.","['epsilon-delta', 'continuity', 'real-analysis', 'metric-spaces', 'uniform-continuity']"

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)g_\epsilon (x)dt=f(0)$$

And since $\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2/\epsilon^2}=0$, the result is $0$, not $f(0)$. Another approach was to just set $t=x$ so that $\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac1 \epsilon e^{-x^2/\epsilon^2}=\sqrt\pi$ would cancel out with $1/\pi$, but then I'm left with $f(x)$ instead of $f(0)$.","['dirac-delta', 'limits']"

Some definitions that I recently learned: Uniformly bounded means $\sup_{f\in\mathcal{F}}||f||_{\infty}<\infty$ Equicontinuous means $\forall \epsilon>0 \exists \delta:d(x,y)<\delta\implies |f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon \text{ for all } f\in\mathcal{F}$ Theorem (Arzela-Ascoli) Let $X$ be a compact metric space, and let $\mathcal{F}\subset C(X)$. Then $\mathcal{F}$ compact if and only if  $\mathcal{F}$ is closed, uniformly bounded, and equicontinuous. (Note that $\mathcal{F}$ is a collection of continuous real-valued functions on $X$, and  $C(X)$ is the space of all continuous functions $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$) Proof. (I understand the $\implies$ direction, so I omit that part of the proof.) For $\impliedby$: Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ is closed, uniformly bounded, and equicontinuous and let $(f_n)\in\mathcal{F}.$ $\color{blue}{\text{We need to show that $(f_n)$ has a uniformly convergent subsequence.}}$ $\color{blue}{\text{First note that $(f_n)$ is equicontinuous.}}$ Thus given $\epsilon>0, \exists \delta >0: d(x,y)<\delta\implies |f_n(x)-f_n(y)|<\epsilon/3, \forall n$. Next since $X$ is totally bounded, $X$ has a finite $\delta$-net, i.e, there exists $x_1,\ldots, x_k\in X$ such that each $x\in X$ satisfies $d(x,x_i)<\delta$. $\color{blue}{\text{Now since $(f_n)$ is also uniformly bounded,}}$ each of the sequences $(f_n(x_i))_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is bounded in $\mathbb{R}$ for $i=1,2,\ldots, k$. $\color{blue}{\text{Thus by passing  to a subsequence of the $f_n$ (and relabeling), we may suppose that $(f_n(x_i))_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges for each $i=1,2,\ldots, k$}}$. In particular, we can find some $N$ such that $|f_m(x_i)-f_n(x_i)|<\epsilon/3$ for any $m,n\geq N$ and any $i=1,2,\ldots, k$. And now we are done! Given $x\in X$, first find $i$ such that $d(x,x_i)<\delta$ and then whenever $m,n\geq N$, we will have 
\begin{align*}
&|f_m(x)-f_n(x)|\\
&\leq|f_m(x)-f_m(x_i)|+|f_m(x_i)-f_n(x_i)|+|f_n(x_i)-f_n(x)|\\ &<\epsilon/3+\epsilon/3+\epsilon/3\\
&=\epsilon
\end{align*} That is, $f_n$ is uniformy Cauchy, since our choice of $N$ does not depend on $x$. Since $\mathcal{F}$ is closed in $C(X)$ by assumption, it follows that $f_n(x)$ converges to some $f\in\mathcal{F}$, uniformly. $\blacksquare$ More explictly, my questions are: For the first blue line, why are we trying to show that $(f_n)$ has a uniformly convergent subsequence? For the second blue line, how do we know $(f_n)$ is equicontinuous? For the third blue line, how can we tell that $(f_n)$ is uniformly bounded? For the fourth blue line, can someone elaborate on what Carothers is trying to do here? I'm having trouble understanding what is occurring at this step. Thanks.","['proof-explanation', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
1025499,I got a question about trig on the unit circle,"The unit circle is defined to be $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ . Makes sense. Its an equation of a circle. Now from here if we think about cosine as the $x$ value and sine as the $y$ value then we get a trig identity most of use know. There was something about this that always bothered me. And maybe this sounds crazy, but why can we use trigonometric functions to define a point on the unit circle? $$\cos x  = \frac{ \text{adj} }{ \text{hyp} } \quad \text{and} \quad \sin x  = \frac{ \text{opp} }{ \text{hyp} }$$ So I can see why $\cos(x)$ would be defined in terms of an $x$ value since the adjacent side is the leg of the triangle that is on the $x$ axis but where is the hypotenuse going at in this argument?

1025633,Winding numbers are continuous: The proof was too easy,"There's a question in my complex analysis book: Let $G$ be a region and let $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ be two closed smooth curves in $G$. Suppose $\gamma_0\sim\gamma_1$ and $\Gamma$ is a homotopy between them. Also suppose that $\gamma_t(s)=\Gamma(s,t)$ is smooth for each $t$. If $w\in \mathbb{C}-G$, define $h(t)=n(\gamma_t;w)$ and show that $h:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ is continuous. This is an exercise right after the section that proves the following version of Cauchy's theorem : If $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ are two closed rectifiable curves in $G$ and $\gamma_0 \sim \gamma_1$ then $$\int_{\gamma_{0}}f=\int_{\gamma_1} f$$ for every function $f$ analytic on $G.$ I must be missing something. It seems like you can just say the following: 'Proof:' Since $\frac{1}{z-w}$ is analytic in $G$ ($w$ isn't in $G$), and $\gamma_0\sim\gamma_t\ \forall t\in[0,1]$ (consider a rescaled version of $\Gamma$), then by Cauchy's theorem, $n(\gamma_t;w)=n(\gamma_0;w)=n(\gamma_1;w)$. Thus, the winding number is constant along $t$ and thus certainly continuous. My problem with that is that this doesn't require the assumption that $\Gamma$ is a smooth homotopy.

$$\frac{1}{2}f_{xx}(a,a)(x-y)^2.$$
By $C^2$ I mean that all of the first and second order partial deriatives exist and are continuous. I first looked at the form of the term, which is
$$\frac{1}{2}f_{xx}(a,a)x^2 + \frac{1}{2}f_{yy}(a,a)y^2 + f_{xy}(a,a)xy.$$
Since I have $f(x,y) = f(y,x)$, differentiating with respect to the first variable gives me $f_x(x,y) = f_y(y,x)$ and differentiating again gives me $f_{xx}(x,y) = f_{yy}(y,x)$, so taking $x = y = a$ I get $f_{xx}(a,a) = f_{yy}(a,a)$. Then the term becomes
$$\frac{1}{2}f_{xx}(a,a)(x^2 + y^2) + f_{xy}(a,a)xy.$$ I think what I need to do is show that $f_{xy}(a,a) = -f_{xx}(a,a)$, at which point the second derivative factors out and $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy$ can be simplified to $(x-y)^2$.
