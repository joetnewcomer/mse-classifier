243354,algebraic manipulation of differential form,"Suppose $\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots, \phi_k \in (\mathbb{R}^n)^*$, and $\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$ $(\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ stands for the space of all linear transformations that goes from $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is it true that: $$\phi_1\wedge\dots\wedge\phi_k(\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k) = \mathrm{det}[\phi_i(\mathbf{v}_j)]$$ This is a homework question (from Multivariable Mathematics , Shifrin, Ex.18 on Page 347) and there is a hint that:we could first express all $\phi_i$ in the form of: $$\phi_i = \sum\limits_{j=1}^n a_{ij}dx_j$$ where $dx_j$ is the basis 1-form and the hint also says that it suffices to prove this equality in the case where all $v_j$ are standard basis vectors i.e. $v_1=e_{j_1}, \dots, v_k = e_{j_k}$ From the setup of the hint, it is quite obvious that the right side equals: $$
\begin{vmatrix}
a_{1j_1}&\cdots&a_{1j_k}\\
\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
a_{kj_1}&\cdots&a_{kj_k}\\
\end{vmatrix}
$$ However, I cannot understand how to show the left side equals this determinant. Also, I am not very sure why it suffices to show that the equality holds when $v_j$ are all standard basis vectors. Is it because I could express every $v_j$ as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors?

243358,Bathtub principle proof,"Let $ (\Omega, \Sigma, \mu) $ be a measure space and let $f$ be a real valued function on $\Omega $ such that  $\mu (x :f(x)<t) $ is finite for all t $\in \mathbb{R}$.

243359,"Show that $\phi: \mathbb{R}_3[x]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3, \phi(p):=[p(-1), p(0), p(1)] $ is a linear transformation","Let $\mathbb{R}_3[x]$ be a vector space of polynomials p with degree $\leq3$ and show that $\phi: \mathbb{R}_3[x]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3, \phi(p):=[p(-1), p(0), p(1)] $ is a linear transformation. Now I know that transformation is linear if these two conditions are true: A linear transformation between two vector spaces $V$ and $W$ is a map $T:V\rightarrow W$ such that the following hold: $T(v_1+v_2)=T(v_1)+T(v_2)$ for any vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ in $V$, and $T(\alpha v)=\alpha T(v)$ for any scalar $\alpha$.

243379,"What are other solutions to this differential equation, ""similar"" to $\sin x$ and $e^x$?","I've been studying electronics, where they make great use of the relationship between the sine and exponential functions ($e^{i \omega t} = \cos{\omega t} + i \sin \omega t)$. This relationship is confusing to me, so I started digging into it, and thinking about how they have similar definitions, in terms of differential equations. $f(x) = e^x$ is the solution to this differential equation: $$
f'(x) = f(x)
$$ and $f(x) = \sin x$ is a solution to this similar equation: $$
f'(x) = f(x + \pi/2)

f'(x) = f(x + k)

243383,Proof of the theorem about term-wise differentiation of power series,"I have some doubts concerning the proof of the ""term-wise differentiation of power series"" theorem. Below, I first included 3 theorems that are used in the proof; then, I included the whole proof and state the related theorems; finally, I included my specific doubts about it. The theorems used in the proof are basically the Squeeze Theorem and the facts that the first and second derivatives of a power series have the same radius of convergence as the original power series. They are stated as follows: Theorem 1: If the radius of convergence of the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n$ is $R>0$, then R is also the radius of convergence of the series $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_nx^{n-1}.$ Theorem 2: If the radius of convergence of the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n$ is $R>0$, then R is also the radius of convergence of the series $\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty} n(n-1)c_nx^{n-2}.$ Theorem 3 (also known as Squeeze Theorem): Assume $f$, $g$ and $h$ are functions defined in an open interval $I$ containing $a$, except, possibly, at $a$ itself, and that $f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x$ in $I$ such that $x\neq a$. If both $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to a}h(x)$ exist and are equal to $L$, then $\lim_{x\to a}g(x)$ also exists and is equal to $L$. The theorem statement and its proof, about which I have some questions, are below: Theorem: Let $\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n$ be a power series whose radius of convergence is $R>0$. Then, if $f$ is the function defined by $$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n \ \ \ \ (1)$$ $f'(x)$ exists for all $x$ in the open interval $(-R,R)$, and it is given by $$f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} n c_nx^{n-1}$$ PROOF : Let $x$ and $a$ be two distinct numbers in the open interval $(-R,R)$. The Taylor formula, with $n = 1$, is $$f(x) = f(a) + \dfrac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \dfrac{f''(\xi)}{2!}(x-a)^2$$ Using this formula with $f(x) = x^n$, we have, for every positive integer $n$,
  $$x^n=a^n+na^{n-1}(x-a)+\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)(\xi_n)^{n-2}(x-a)^2 \ \ \ \ (2)$$
  where $\xi_n$ is between $a$ and $x$, for every positive integer $n$. From (1) we have
  $$\begin{align}
f(x)-f(a) &= \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n - \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_na^n\\
          &= c_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_nx^n - c_0 - \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_na^n\\
          &= \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_n(x^n - a^n)
\end{align}$$
  Dividing by $x-a$ (because $x\neq a$) and using (2), we have, from the above equation
  $$ \dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = \dfrac{1}{x-a} \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_n[na^{n-1}(x-a)+\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)(\xi_n)^{n-2}(x-a)^2] $$
  Thus,
  $$ \dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_na^{n-1}+\frac{1}{2}(x-a)\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2} \ \ \ \ (3)$$ Since $a$ is in $(-R,R)$, it follows from Theorem 1 that $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}nc_na^{n-1}$ is absolutely convergent. Since both $a$ and $x$ are in $(-R,R)$, there exists a number $K > 0$ such that $|a|<K<R$ and $|x|<K<R$. It follows from Theorem 2 that $$\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_nK^{n-2}$$ is absolutely convergent. Then, since $$|n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2}| < |n(n-1)c_nK^{n-2}| \ \ \ \ (4)$$ for every $\xi_n$, we can conclude, from the comparison test, that
  $$\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2}$$
  is absolutely convergent. It follows from (3) that $$ \left|\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} - \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_na^{n-1}\right| = \left|\frac{1}{2}(x-a)\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2}\right| \ \ \ \ (5)$$ However, we know that, if $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}u_n$ is absolutely convergent, then $$\left|\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}u_n\right| \leq \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}|u_n|$$ Applying this to the right side of (5), we obtain:
  $$ \left|\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} - \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_na^{n-1}\right| \leq \frac{1}{2}|x-a|\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)|c_n||\xi_n|^{n-2} \ \ \ \ (6)$$
  From (4) and (6), we obtain:
  $$ \left|\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} - \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_na^{n-1}\right| \leq \frac{1}{2}|x-a|\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)|c_n|K^{n-2} \ \ \ \ (7)$$
  where $0<K<R$. Since the series on the right side of (7) is absolutely convergent, the limit on the right side, as $x$ approaches $a$, is zero. Thus, from (17) and from Theorem 3 (Squeeze Theorem), it follows that
  $$\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}nc_na^{n-1}$$
  which is equivalent to
  $$f'(a)=\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}nc_na^{n-1}$$
  and, since $a$ can be any number in the open interval $(-R,R)$, the theorem is proven. My 2 doubts are: Why is the step that transforms (6) into (7) necessary? Assuming that the goal is to have the right side of the inequality to be convergent, then, since $\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2}$ is known to be absolutely convergent, isn't this goal already achieved by the summation on the right side of (6)? How is the last limit obtained from (7) and the Squeeze Theorem? It seems that, from (7) and the Squeeze Theorem, it follows that $\lim_{x\to a} \left[ \dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} - \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_na^{n-1}\right] =0$. So, I think that, since $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x = a$, then I know that $lim_{x\to a} [f(x)-f(a)]/(x-a)$ exists; so I can simply distribute the limit over the sum and arrive at the result. Is this correct?","['sequences-and-series', 'power-series', 'calculus']"

243539,Combinatorial optimization - improve performance,"I am writing a program to solve a combinatorial optimization problem. I have been working on an algorithm that gets the desired results, but I am having difficulties getting the algorithm to perform well. The problem domain is the medical equipment supply industry, and the basic requirement is to assign items to packages so that the rental charge is minimized. Equipment can be rented individually, but there are also packages defined containing a combination of equipments, and the rental charge of the packages is less than the total rental charge of the individual equipments. While generating the bill, I need to assign the items to packages wherever possible in such a way that the total rental charge is minimized. In my model, packages are defined as follows Each package can contains 1..N Groups G1, G2, G3,.. GN. Each Group must have at least X items (where X >= 0), and at most Y items ( Y > 0, Y >= X) Each Group can contain 1..n Item Types IT1, IT2, ... ITn Each Item Type must be included at least A times (A >= 0) in the group, and at most B times (B > 0, B >= A) An example of a packages could be as follows; Bed and Wheelchair package 
    Group: Bed (total item min 1, max 1)
        Bed 6 feet (min 0, max 1)
        Bed 6.5 feet (min 0, max 1)
    Group: Wheelchair (total item min 1, max 1)
        Manual wheelchair (min 0, max 1)
        Motorized wheelchair (min 0, max 1)
    Group: Accessories (min 0, max 3)
        Air Mattress (min 0, max 1)
        Air blower (min 0, max 1)
        Pillows (min 0, max 2) There would be multiple packages available similar to the above. 
One particular Item Type can appear only once in a package. However, different packages can have the same Item Type. Assumptions / Requirements: Each package has a rental charge associated with it, as does each Item Type. When renting a package, only the package price is charged, not
the items inside the package. A rental can consist of both packages and
individual items. When renting out X number of items of different types, the items should be assigned to packages where possible, so that the total rental is minimized. There can be multiple ways of forming the packages, and the ones with the lowest rental should be selected. There can be multiple combinations that produce the lowest
rental. All of them are required in the result. (I may be able to work
around this requirement if absolutely needed). I need to support rental of up to 25 items. The number of available packages can vary
from 10 to 20. An additional complexity that I will need to add later is to support the concept of packages contained inside packages. I need to run this for multiple rental bills in a batch mode, which makes the
performance of the algorithm so critical. My approach so far: For each item, find a list of the packages that it can belong to based on the item type. Create a graph where each node is a item-package assignment. Arrange the graph so that the nodes at each leaf level represent the possible package assignments for a single item. Do a depth first traversal of the graph, pruning the subtree and backtracking when it is obvious that the subtree cannot result in an optimal solution. I am pruning the subtree when either of the following is false: When the remaining items are included, can it satisfy the minimum quantities required for each package in the branch so far ? Is the total price of the packages included so far less than the total of the  individual price of all the line items ? The approach is ending up with an expensive calculation. In one test with 24 items and a small number of packages, it traversed 2.5 million nodes and took more than a minute for the results to come back. Ideally, I would like the results to be returned in seconds. I will very much appreciate any pointers to an efficient algorithm that can be used for this problem. EDIT: I am adding an example of a bill and package. Bed and Accessories package

243544,Bijection between $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}$,"I was wondering if it is possible to produce an explicit bijection $h\colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}$. If we can produce an explicit injection $i\colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}$, can the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroeder Theorem be used constructively?

What I am really looking for is a nice-looking bijection, or a proof that no such nice-looking bijection exists, for a definition of ""nice-looking"" which I cannot quite figure out. One problem which I think makes finding such a bijection difficult is that any natural injection of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}$ (ie, those injections in which one representative is chosen from each coset) produces a non-measurable set, specifically a Vitali set . I hate to ask such a vague question, but I'm really not sure about whether the correct answer is constructive, or whether it is a proof that any such bijection is in some sense ""very complicated.""

243572,Proof of Hartogs's theorem,"I'd be very grateful if someone could help me understand the proof of Hartogs's theorem appearing in Huybrechts' ""Complex Geometry."" The statement is: Let $\mathbb{P}^n \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ be the unit polydisc. Let $\mathbb{P}_c:= \{ \boldsymbol{z} : 0\leq |z_i|<c\}$ for some $0<c<1$.  Then if $f: \mathbb{P}^n -\bar{\mathbb{P}}_c \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic, then $f$ extends to a holomorphic function on $\mathbb{P}$. The proof goes as follows: For fixed $\boldsymbol{w} \in \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$, the function $f_w: z \mapsto f(z,\boldsymbol{w})$ defines a holomorphic function on the annular region $A= \{z: c<|z|<1 \}$ in the complex plain. Let $f_w= \Sigma_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a_k(\boldsymbol{w})z^k$ be the Laurent expansion of $f_w$ in this region.  Then the $a_k$ define holomorphic functions on $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ (by a previous lemma) and if $k<0$ then $a_k$ vanishes whenever some $w_i>c$ (since $f_w$ then extends to the whole disc) and so vanishes on all of $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$.  Therefore we can write $f|_{A \times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}}= \Sigma_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k(\boldsymbol{w})z^k$. I understand everything up to this point.  What I can't understand is why this sum of holomorphic functions defines a holomorphic function on all of the unit polydisc. Presumably it is supposed to converge uniformly on compact subsets or something? Huybrechts says something like ""the $a_k$ attain their suprema on the boundary and so uniform convergence is implied by uniform convergence on the annular region"" and I have no idea what boundary or annular region he's talking about.  A priori I don't know why I should really know anything about the uniformity of the convergence of the sum outside of a single copy of $A$ i.e. when $\boldsymbol{w}$ is fixed.

Here is my argument:
Let $r(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t))$ be the flow  of (1). Since $\frac{d}{dt} V(x,y,z)=0$ then $r'(t)\cdot \nabla V=0$. Hence, $r(t)$ always be in a surface $V(x,y,z)=x^2+2y^2=C$ (A cylinder). If we make the radius of cylinder smaller then $x$ and $y$ component of $r(t)$ tend to 0 but $z$ component of $r(t)$ can be infinite since the height of cylinder is infinite. So, $r(t)$ can be far away from (0,0,0) and $u_0$=(0,0,0) is unstable. Where is the error of my argument? Can we guarantee that $z$ component of $r(t)$ can't go to infinity?

Castelnuovo's theorem says that a smooth rational curve $E$ on an algebraic surface $S$ is an exceptional curve iff $E^2=-1$. The proof in Beauville's book is to find a very ample divisor $H$ satisfying $H^1(S,\mathcal{O}_S(H))=0$ first, and then set $H'=H+kE$ where $k=H\cdot E$. The linear system of $H'$ gives a projective morphism from $S$ to $\mathbb{P}^n$ which contracts $E$, and then some topological arguments implies that the image of $S$ is actually smooth. Although this proof is not difficult to understand, I still want a proof based on complex manifolds but not algebraic geometry. Question : Is there any holomorphic version of the tubular neighborhood theorem? I have several reasons to raise this question: If we have some holomorphic tubular neighborhood theorem, we can identify some neighborhood $U$ of $E$ in $S$ with neighborhood $V$ of the zero section in $N_E$. Here $N_E$ is the holomorphic normal bundle of $E$. Then $E^2=-1$ easily implies $N_E\cong\mathcal{O}_{E}(-1)$, so $E$ can be contracted in $U$ directly.

243909,What are some motivating examples of exotic metrizable spaces,"Among topological spaces, the metric spaces are usually considered to be the tame animals. Describing the topological notion of closeness by a distance is so intuitive (as opposed to the abstract definition of topology) that we don't expect metric spaces to be too wild. But it is such a wide class of objects that I think they can nonetheless be quite counter-intuitive and pathological in many ways. What are your favourite, maybe eye-opening examples, preferably with properties like you wouldn't expect (not necessarily purely metric or topological properties)? As a starting point I will list some examples which, at this point, no longer really surprise me, but they exhibit some properties which may defy (or expand) intuition: The plane endowed with the center metric (that is, the distance between two points is either the Euclidean distance between them if they lie on the same line through the origin, or the sum of their distances to the origin otherwise). In this example, balls around zero are just Euclidean balls, but balls around any other point look like the union of an Euclidean about origin (which may possibly be empty) and an open interval. This shows that a metric space need not look the same everywhere, and that balls can grow in a very non-uniform way. No matter how large a set we choose, if we endow it with discrete metric. This shows that a metrisable (even completely metrisable and locally compact) space need not be small in the sense of cardinality, and that we can put the structure of a metric space on any set. Further expanding on the ""bigness"" front, for any cardinality $\kappa$ there is a (completely metrisable) Hilbert space of dimension $\kappa$. For suitably large $\kappa$ they can be very large in many different ways, for example, any dense subset of such a space has cardinality at least $\kappa$, they can hold $\kappa$ disjoint balls. On the other hand, any compact subset of such a space (for infinite $\kappa$) has empty interior, and they are still path-connected, so very far from discrete. Related examples are general normed spaces, including operator spaces and abstract Banach spaces. I'm curious some other practical examples of very large metric spaces (which are not normed vector spaces). A kind of meta-example are ultrametric spaces, satisfying the strong triangle inequality (see wiki ). They have the property that every triangle is isosceles, and that any open ball is centered at each of its points. Note that discrete spaces are ultrametric. Classical examples of ultrametric spaces are the Cantor space $2^\omega$ of binary sequences and the Baire space $\omega^\omega$ of sequences of natural numbers. They're both Polish, and even though they're perfect (every point is a limit point), they're totally disconnected. The former is compact, while the latter has the property that no compact set has nonempty interior. If we take a Bernstein set $X$ on the real line (that is, a set such that its intersection with any uncountable closed set is nonempty, and whose complement also has the property), then it is a separable metric space of size continuum, which has the property that every compact subset is countable. From this it follows that no nonzero continuous measure on $X$ is Radon, since every such measure must be zero on all compact sets. This places $X$ on the opposite of Polish spaces among metrizable spaces in a way, since any bounded Borel measure on a Polish space is Radon. Note that any probability Borel measure on a metric space has to be regular, so we can't get much more pathological than that. On a different front, a Bernstein set is a Baire space (the intersection of a countable family of open dense sets is dense), but the associated Banach-Mazur game is undecidable. It is, in many ways, the most pathological a subset of a Polish space can be. For a more geometric example, a Gromov Hyperbolic group endowed with word length metric has the property that for any triangle, any point on one side can only be away from the two other sides by a distance bounded by a constant, no matter what the vertices of the triangle might be. I think this is a property shared by hyperbolic spaces, but I'm not very familiar with hyperbolic geometry so I'd rather not say something I'm not sure about. :)","['examples-counterexamples', 'general-topology', 'big-list', 'soft-question', 'metric-spaces']"

The Semidirect product command in Magma takes arguments Semidirect(K,H,f):Grp, Grp, Map -> Grp to produce the semidirect product $K\rtimes_f H$ as a group object.  Here f is a homorphism from H into AutK , where AutK is the Automorphism group of K, formed ( I assume ) by AutomorphismGroup(K) . In Magma, I set GLnp := GL(n,p); and make $f$ using f := hom< G -> GLnp | ... >; and $E$ using E := AbelianGroup([p:i in [1..n]]); .  Then I make AutE := AutomorphismGroup(E); .  So now the problem is taking that f and turning it into a homomorphism from G to AutE so that I can use it with SemidirectProduct. The natural way I thought to do this was to construct an isomorphism g from GLnp to AutE , then setting phi := g*f; and forming SemidirectProduct(E,G,phi); .  I find the GrpAuto class pretty difficult to work with, but managed to do this in a hack-y way when I had $n=3$ and $p=2$ .  However when I then tried to use the same method to form the group I really wanted, for which $n=10$ and $p=23$ , the isomorphism from g from GLnp to AutE blew up, I assume because Magma tries to take the cartesian product of the two sets and then form the map as a subset (or something like that).  I tried a couple other ways of forming g , and some worked at first, but then blew up when I used SemidirectProduct(E,G,phi); . My $G$ here only has order $2640$ and Magma handles $E$ just fine by itself, so it seems like a permutation group on the scale of $E \rtimes_f G$ should be be well within the computational limits of Magma.  (I have made permutation groups around that size before!)  The  problem is finding a way around whatever Magma is doing that is costing so much memory. So I have three questions about this. Am I wrong? Is what I want to do simply outside the computational limits of Magma? In general, What is the best way to make a homomorphism into a GrpAuto object from a GrpMat object? and, most importantly of all, How can I form $E\rtimes_f G$ in Magma given a homomorphism $f:G\rightarrow\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_p)$ , given as a map f from GrpPC : G to GL(n, GF(p)) ?","['magma-cas', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'math-software', 'computer-algebra-systems']"

The question asks you to show the following: $\int_0^{2\pi} \log|1-ae^{i\theta}| \; \mathrm d\theta=0$ when $|a|<1$. I was able to do this by showing that $\int_0^{2\pi} \log(1-ae^{i\theta})\; \mathrm d\theta=0$ by substituting $z=e^{i\theta}$ and then calculating the residue of $\frac{\log(1-az)}{zi}$ at the origin to be zero.

My attempt at solution -> Define $F(a) = \int_0^{2\pi} \log(1-ae^{i\theta})\; \mathrm d\theta$ Then, it can be shown that $F(a)$ is holomorphic in $|a|<1$. Given that $F(a)=0$ on the entire $|a|<1$, we can say that limit of $F(a)$ is $0$ when $|a|$ approaches 1. Therefore, since $F(a)$ is holomorphic in $|a|<1$ and converges uniformly to $0$ as $|a|$ approaches $1$, we can extend $F(a)$ to the boundary $|a|=1$ ((Is this true? Or in general, when can you ""continuously extend"" a holomorphic function defined on an open set to the boundary of the open set?)) Thus, we have a function $F(a)$ that takes on the value $0$ for $|a|<=1$. Since $\int_0^{2\pi} \log|1-ae^{i\theta}|\; \mathrm d\theta $ is the real part of $\int_0^{2\pi} \log(1-ae^{i\theta})\; \mathrm d\theta $, it follows that $\int_0^{2\pi} \log|1-ae^{i\theta}|\; \mathrm d\theta=0 $ for $|a| = 1$ as well.

  $\dot{v} = Bv$, where $B = -A$. Similarly, show that if u(t) solves $\dot{u} = Au$, then $v(t) =
 u(2t)$ solves $\dot{v} = Bv$, where $B = 2A$. I don't know how to formally prove this. It seems obvious because since the solution $v(t) = u(-t)$ is the same as $u(t)$ but it has a scalar which is negative and a scalar can be taken out of the solution and placed outside which follows that we have $-A$. The same goes with the second part of the question.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
244166,Who first called the Grothendieck's schéma scheme?,"Grothendieck called ""schemes"" schémas in French.
I find it strange we call them schemes.
In fact, Grothendieck called them (pre-) schemas(this is an English word) in his talk(in English ) at Proceeding of the international congress of mathematicians at Edinburgh in 1958.
There is an English word schema which means almost the same as French schéma.
I think English words schema and scheme have different meanings and nuances although they are similar.
So who first called Grothendieck's schéma scheme in English?
And why he did not call it schema?","['algebraic-geometry', 'math-history']"
244168,Sum of independent random variables being a.s. constant implies that each of them is a.s. constant,"I am trying to solve the following problem: Let $(\Omega, \mathbb{A}, \mathbb{P})$ be a probability space and $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ independent real random variables.

In Concrete Mathematics (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik), it is shown how to evaluate this sum with absolute error $O(1)$, but it is not clear to me, how to obtain better absolute error in a straightforward manner.

244211,Schemes covered by finitely-many affine open subsets,"Let $X$ be a scheme covered by a finite number of affine open subsets $U_i$ such that for  any $U_i, U_j$, the $U_i\cap U_j$ is a union of finite number of affine open subsets $W^{(i,j)}_h$.
Then for any affine open subsets $U, V$, the $U\cap V$ is a union of a  finite number of affine open subsets.
This is essentially Vakil's note 6.1.H(p142). It would be very appreciated if you give an elementary proof.(I knew the definition of schemes only a week ago. All I know is before 6.1.H.)

244255,Determining limit points and proving there are no more of them,"Determine all limits points of the following sequences: $\displaystyle a_n=\begin{cases}2^{-n},&n\text{ even},\\3^{1/n},&n\text{ odd}.\end{cases}$ $\displaystyle b_n=n+\frac{2(-1)^nn^2+3}{2n+1}$ $\displaystyle c_n=\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{4}\right)$ $\displaystyle d_n=\frac{n+1}{n}\cdot i^n$ Explain for each sequence why the specified points are limit points and why there are no other limit points except than the ones you determined. I am famous for doing everything way too difficult, so I would both like to know whether my results are correct and how to improve them considering length and comprehensibility. Furthermore I don't know how to prove that I found all limit points - any help/hints? For the proof that there is at least one limit point I use the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem which states that every bounded sequence has at least one converging subsequence. Sequence 1 Just by looking at the sequence we see, that $|a_n|\le\sqrt{3}$ and therefore at least one converging subsequence with the related limit points does exist. We take subsequences $(a_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb{N}_0}$ with $n_k=2k$ such that $\displaystyle(a_{2k})_{k\in\mathbb{N}}=\frac{1}{2^{2k}}$ and we know that this is a null sequence and $0$ is therefore one limit point. $n_k=2k+1$ such that $\displaystyle(a_{2k+1})_{k\in\mathbb{N}}=\sqrt[2k+1]{3}$ and we know that the $n$-th square root is convergent and therefore $\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{3}=1$ which is the second (and last) limit point. Sequence 2 We can definitely see, that $|b_n|\ge 0$ and is therefore bounded and there exsists at least one limit point. We do look once again at subsequences $(b_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb{N}_0}$ with the following two cases: $n_k=2k$ such that we get $$2k+\frac{2(2k)^2+3}{2(2k)+1}=2k+\frac{8k^2+3}{4k+1}=\frac{16k^2+2k+3}{4k+1}\longrightarrow +\infty$$ which is no limit point. $n_k=2k+1$ such that $$2k+1+\frac{-2(2k+1)^2+3}{2(2k+1)+1}=2k+1+\frac{-8k^2-8k+1}{4k+3}=\frac{k(2+4/k)}{k(4+3/k)}\longrightarrow \frac{1}{2}$$ which is our one and only limit point for this sequence. Sequence 3 The basic properties of $\sin$ imply that $\displaystyle\left|\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{4}\right)\right|\le 1$ and we should find some limit points. In fact we will find five of them. Assuming that we know that $\sin(0)=0$, $\cos(0)=1$, $\sin(\pi)=1$, $\cos(\pi)=-1$, $\sin(\pi/4)=1/\sqrt{2}$, $\sin(-\pi/4)=-1/\sqrt{2}$, $\sin(x+2k\pi)=\sin(x)$, $\cos(x+2k\pi)=\cos(x)$ and $\sin(x+\pi/2)=\cos(x)$ we again do look at subsequences $(c_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb{N}_0}$ where we distinguisch between 8 cases: $n_k=8k:$ $$\sin\left(\frac{8k\pi}{4}\right)=\sin(2k\pi)=0$$ $n_k=8k+1:$ $$\sin\left(\frac{(8k+1)\pi}{4}\right)=\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}+2k\pi\right)=\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$ $n_k=8k+2:$ $$\sin\left(\frac{(8k+2)\pi}{4}\right)=\sin\left(\frac{(4k+1)\pi}{2}\right)=\cos(2k\pi)=\cos(0)=1$$ $n_k=8k+3:$ $$\sin\left(\frac{(8k+3)\pi}{4}\right)=\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}+2k\pi\right)=\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)=\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$ $n_k=8k+4:$ $$\sin\left(\frac{(8k+4)\pi}{4}\right)=\sin\left((2k+1)\pi\right)=\sin(\pi)=0$$ $n_k=8k+5:$ $$\sin\left(\frac{(8k+5)\pi}{4}\right)=\sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{4}+2k\pi\right)=\sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{4}\right)=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$ $n_k=8k+6:$ $$\sin\left(\frac{(8k+6)\pi}{4}\right)=\sin\left(\frac{(4k+3)\pi}{2}\right)=\sin\left(2k\pi+\frac{3\pi}{2}\right)=\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right)=\cos(\pi)=-1$$ $n_k=8k+7:$ $$\sin\left(\frac{(8k+7)\pi}{4}\right)=\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}+2k\pi\right)=\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$ Therefore we have five limit points: $0,\pm 1,\pm 1/\sqrt{2}$. Sequence 4 This sequence is apparently bounded by the unit circle and therefore we know that $|d_n|\ge 1$. We distinguish here four different cases: $\frac{4k+1}{4k}\cdot 1\longrightarrow 1$ $\frac{4k+2}{4k+1}\cdot i\longrightarrow i$ $\frac{4k+3}{4k+2}\cdot (-1)\longrightarrow (-1)$ $\frac{4k+4}{4k+3}\cdot (-i)\longrightarrow (-i)$ This leads to the result that each $i^k$ is a limit point.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"
