3473221,What is the $B^{-1}$ if $B^2 -5B + I = 0$ [duplicate],This question already has an answer here : Proving Invertibility and Eigenvalues (1 answer) Closed 4 years ago . I think how I did it was that I did $B (B -5I) = -I$ and then divided both sides by $-1$ to get $B (-B+5BI) = I$ and then said $(-B+5I) = B^{-1}$ . Is this correct or is there a better way of doing it/answer?,"['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

3473300,Please correct if there a mistake on my Explicit formula of 7th Steps Adam-Bashforth-Moulton,"I'm searching in the internet, and i can't find about the formula (Sadly). But if you know or found the amazing sites that gives some formula of Explicit Adam-Bashforth for any higer order (including 7th) in formal equation or code please share it to me. And for my final choice, finally i found the formula by myself. I derive it manually with lagrange interpolation of order 6. (It's true isn't it? Because ABM 7th needs 7 points to constructs its formula) . Here is my formula.

3473338,CDF of ratio of independent standard normal distributions,"Question; Given two independent standard normally distributed random variables $X,Y,$ find the cumulative density function of $\frac{X}{Y}.$ My attempt: Note that \begin{align*}

3473453,Frenet-Serret and Vector Fields,"The well-known Frenet-Serret equations, $\dot T(s) = \kappa N(s), \tag 1$ $\dot N(s) = -\kappa(s) T(s) + \tau(s) B(s), \tag 2$ $\dot B(s) = -\tau(s) N(s), \tag 3$ where $T = \dot \alpha(s), \tag 4$ $\alpha(s)$ being a unit speed curve in $\Bbb R^3$ with arc-length $s$ , are most often applied to discover and describe properties of such space curves . Given an open set $U \subset \Bbb R^3, \tag 5$ and a vector field $X \in C^\infty(U, \Bbb R^3) \tag 6$ on $U$ , we may of course consider the flow $\phi_X(x, t)$ of $X$ ; the reader will recall it is defined as, more or less, the entire family of integral curves of the vector field $X$ in the sense that $\phi_X(x, 0) = x, \; \forall x \in U, \tag 7$ and $\dfrac{d}{dt}\phi(x, t) = X(\phi(x, t)). \tag 8$ A somewhat natural area of inquiry based upon these two concepts, the Frenet-Serret apparatus and vector fields and their flows, is the relationship 'twixt the Frenet-Serret formulas and the integral curves of $X$ ; that is, finding the expressions for $T(s)$ , $N(s)$ , $B(s)$ , $\kappa(s)$ and $\tau(s)$ in terms of $X$ and related quantities such as its magnitude $\vert X \vert = \langle X, X \rangle^{1/2}$ and its derivatives $\nabla X$ etc. The Question then becomes: Given a (sufficiently smooth) vector field $X$ on an open set $U \subset \Bbb R^3$ , find the vector fields $T(s)$ , $N(s)$ , and $B(s)$ and the scalar quantities $\kappa(s)$ and $\tau(s)$ associated with the integral curves of $X$ , expressed in terms of $X$ and it's associated quantities such as $\vert X \vert$ and so forth. A Few Observations: Given such an open set $U$ and vector field $X$ , of course it is true that the flow $\phi_X(x, t)$ may not exist for all values of $t$ , but this is of no consequence here since all calculations are local in nature.  Indeed, for all $x \in U$ the flow $\phi_X(x, t)$ is defined for sufficiently small values of $t$ , and this is sufficient for the present purposes. A Useful Starting Point may be the observation that $X/\vert X \vert$ is a unit vector field , and that in fact $T(s) = \dfrac{X(\alpha(s))}{\vert X(\alpha(s))\vert} \tag 9$ along the arc-length parametrized integral curve $\alpha(s)$ of $X/ \vert X \vert$ .  Of course, we may also adopt and employ the given parametrization of the integral curves of $X$ by $t$ , as in (7), (8); in fact we have $\dfrac{ds}{dt} = \vert X(\alpha(t)) \vert, \; \dfrac{dt}{ds} = \vert X(\alpha(s)) \vert^{-1}, \tag{10}$ which allow the conversion 'twixt $t$ and $s$ via integration: $s - s_0 = \displaystyle \int_{t_0}^t  \vert X(\alpha(u)) \vert \; du, \; t - t_0 = \displaystyle \int_{s_0}^s  \vert X(\alpha(u)) \vert^{-1} \; du. \tag{11}$ We can also express the unit tangent vector $T$ in terms of the parameter $t$ : $T(t) = \dfrac{X(\alpha(t))}{\vert X(\alpha(t))\vert}. \tag{12}$ In these formulas the reader will recognize that $\alpha(t)$ and $\alpha(s)$ represent the same curves in the geometrical sense, that is, he same paths in $\Bbb R^3$ , though they are differently parametrized.","['vector-fields', 'frenet-frame', 'differential-geometry']"

I would imagine complex analysis is the way to go with such an integral but I have no idea where to even begin.

3473479,proof there are exactly $\mathfrak c$ open sets in $\mathbb R$,"There are exactly $\mathfrak c$ open sets in $\mathbb R$ In the proof of the above theorem, there is one line stating that let $\mathcal I$ be the sets of all open intervals in $\mathbb R$ , then $|\mathcal I|=\mathfrak c$ . The proof I am reading does not provide the details for the above statement. I am trying to prove it. Is my argument below right? Since all the open intervals are in one of the following form: $$(-\infty,a),(a,\infty),or\ (a,b)$$ So the total number of such intervals correspondes to $2$ times the number of ways to choose one number from $\mathbb R$ plus the number of ways to choose two number from $\mathbb R$ Therefore, $$|\mathcal I|=2{\mathfrak c \choose 1}+{\mathfrak c \choose 2}=2\mathfrak c+ \frac {\mathfrak c(\mathfrak c -1)}2 = \mathfrak c$$ This looks very native, is it correct anyway?

3473505,Is this notion of an eigenvector for an $r$-tuple of matrices known?,"Given $r$ complex matrices $A_1,\ldots,A_r$ , each of size $m$ -by- $n$ , we say that a nonzero $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ is a generalized eigenvector of $(A_1,\ldots,A_r)$ if $$A_1x \wedge \cdots \wedge A_rx = \mathbf{0},$$ that is to say, if there is a non-trivial linear relation between $A_1x,\ldots,A_rx$ . One recovers the usual notion of eigenvector if $r=2$ , $m=n$ , $A_1 = A$ ( $A$ is a complex $n$ -by- $n$ matrix) and $A_2 = I$ . I have seen this generalization if $r=2$ , and $m=n$ . Has it been studied if $r>2$ by any chance? If so, does anyone have some references please? If $V=\mathbb{C}^n$ and $W=\mathbb{C}^m$ , then an $r$ -tuple of $m$ -by- $n$ matrices $(A_1,\ldots,A_r)$ defines an $r$ -tuple $(s_1,\ldots,s_r)$ , where $$s_i \in H^0(\mathbb{P}(V), \mathcal{O}(1) \otimes W),$$ ( $1 \leq i \leq n$ ) corresponds to $A_i$ . Thus for a generic $(A_1,\ldots,A_r)$ , the algebraic set $$s_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge s_r = \mathbb{0}$$ is a representative of $H_{2r}(\mathbb{P}(V),\mathbb{C})$ which is dual to $$c_{r}(\mathcal{O}(1) \otimes W, \mathbb{C}) \in H^{2r}(\mathbb{P}(V),\mathbb{C})$$ via Poincare duality.

3473585,Equivalent norms on Sobolev spaces. Only function and last derivative needed to define the norm.,"Equip $W_n^{p}[0,1]$ with the norm $$\left\|f\right\|_{W_n^{p}} = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\left\|f^{(k)}\right\|_{L^p}.$$ I want to prove that this norm is equivalent to the norm $$\left\|f\right\|_2 = \left\|f\right\|_{L^p}+\left\|f^{(n)}\right\|_{L^p}.$$ It is obvious that $\left\|f\right\|_2\leq \left\|f\right\|_{W_n^p}$ so I want to find a constant $C>0$ such that $\left\|f\right\|_{W_n^p}\leq C\left\|f\right\|_2$ . I've managed to solve this in the case $n=2$ but I don't know how to generalize this to the case $n>2$ . Solution in the case $n=2$ : Let $f\in W^{2}_p[0,1]$ . Let $\xi_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $\xi_{\mathrm{min}}'$ be points which minimizes $|f|$ and $|f'|$ respectively. Note that these functions are continuous so these points exists. Now HÃ¶lder's inequality implies that \begin{align*}
		|f'(x)|& = \left|f'(\xi_{\mathrm{min}}')+\int_{\xi_{\mathrm{min}}'}^{x}f''(t)\, dt\right| \\
		& \leq |f'(\xi_{\mathrm{min}}')|+\int_{0}^{1}|f''(t)|\, dt \\ 
		& \leq |f'(\xi_{\mathrm{min}}')|+\left(\int_{0}^{1}|f''(t)|^{p}\,dt\right)^{1/p}
	\end{align*} and by the mean-value theorem \begin{align*}
		2|f(x)|\geq |f(x)-f(\xi_{\mathrm{min}})|=|f'(\xi)||x-\xi_{\mathrm{min}}|\geq |f'(\xi_{\mathrm{min}})||x-\xi_{\mathrm{min}}|
	\end{align*} for some $\xi$ between $x$ and $\xi_{\mathrm{min}}$ . Integrating this inequality yields \begin{equation*}
		\frac{|f'(\xi_{\mathrm{min}}')|}{2} = \int_{0}^{1}|f'(\xi_{\mathrm{min}}')||x-\xi_{\mathrm{min}}|\, dx\leq 2\int_{0}^{1}|f(x)|\, dx \leq 2\|f\|_{L^p}
	\end{equation*} why \begin{equation*}
		|f'(x)|\leq 4\|f\|_{L^p}+\|f''\|_{L^p} \Rightarrow \|f'\|_{L^p}\leq 4\|f\|_{L^p}+\|f''\|_{L^p}	 \leq 4\|f\|_2
	\end{equation*} Now I don't see a way to generalise this method to the case $n>2$ using induction. For instance if we consider the case $n=3$ then applying the method to $f'$ we obtain $$\|f'\|_{L^p} \leq 4\|f\|_{L^p}+\|f''\|_{L^p}$$ but when we do the same estimate on $f''$ we again get a term containing $f'$ so this reasoning becomes circular. This question has been previously asked in Sobolev space and equivalence of norms .
The answer there however seems to be incomplete as it assumes that $f^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for every $k$ and the above calculation in the case that $n=2$ can be seen as a way to get around this fact using calculus.","['sobolev-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
3473637,Continuity of the distance from one dimensional subspaces in Banach spaces,"Let $X$ be a Banach space, call $S_X$ its unit sphere and let $x\in X$ be fixed. Is it true that the function $f:S_X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ given by $y\mapsto\Vert x+\langle y\rangle\Vert$ (i.e. the distance of $x$ from the subspace spanned by $y$ ) is continuous? So far I only managed to prove its upper semicontinuity. If $\{y_n\} \subset S_X$ is a sequence of vectors converging to some $y\in S_X$ , observe that for each $n$ and each scalar $t$ one has $\Vert x+\langle y_n\rangle\Vert\leq\Vert x-ty_n\Vert$ . Passing to the limit on both sides one gets: $$ \limsup_{n\to+\infty}\Vert x+\langle y_n\rangle\Vert\leq\Vert x-ty\Vert $$ Finally, taking the infimum on the right side over all scalars $t$ leads to the formula: $$ \limsup_{n\to+\infty}\Vert x+\langle y_n\rangle\Vert\leq\Vert x+\langle y\rangle \Vert $$ Which proves the upper semicontinuity.

Because $\mathbb{R}$ is complete thus $f_n(x)$ is pointwise convergent to $f(x)$ and $f_n'(x)$ is pointwise convergent to $f'(x)$ . So we found our candidate.

If this inequality is wrong as I suspect, what could be meant instead? Maybe $\|x_i\|_2^2$ instead of $\| x_i \|_2$ ? Then next bound in (1) is $\le \sqrt{m} \max\limits_{k = 1}^{m}\| x_k \|_2$ , which makes sense.","['inequality', 'proof-verification', 'probability-theory', 'real-analysis']"

Let $M=(E,\mathcal I)$ where $E$ is a finite set called the ground set and $\mathcal I$ is a collection of subsets of $E$ called the independent sets satisfying three properties: The empty set is independent, i.e. $\varnothing \in \mathcal I$ . Every subset of an independent set is independent, i.e. if $I\in\mathcal I$ and $J\subset I$ , then $J\in\mathcal I$ . If $I,J\in\mathcal I$ such that $|I|>|J|$ , there exists an element $x\in I$ such that $J\cup\{x\}\in\mathcal I$ . The third property is known as the augmentation or exchange property and of course what makes this definition interesting. Matroids are a structure that abstracts and generalizes the notion of linear independence in vector spaces. Now, I am interested in the general theory of matroids, and am using these video lectures as well as Oxley's Matroid Theory to study the topic. However, I am having some difficulty finding motivation as to why these objects are interesting and how they can be applied to other fields of mathematics. My understanding is that this is largely a combinatorial topic, which is one of my weaker areas in mathematics (I am strongest in analysis and topology). I would appreciate it if someone could provide motivation as to why matroids are an interesting topic to study, as well as ways they can be linked and applied to other fields of mathematics, especially topology.

Does such an $R$ exist? If so, is it unique up to permutation of columns? Detailed statement of the problem: Let $W\in\mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ (where $n > k$ ) be a full-rank matrix which fulfills $W\mathbb{1}_k = \mathbb{1}_n$ . 
Here, $\mathbb{1}_k$ is the vector of ones with length $k$ . Let $f_W: \mathbb{R}^{k\times k}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be the sum of column-wise variances of $W R$ , i.e., $$f_W(R) = \sum\limits_{l=1}^k \frac{1}{n-1} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left(\left(W R\right)_{i,l} - \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \left(W R\right)_{j,l}\right)^2 $$ If I calculated correctly, the Hessian of each of the $k$ summands of $f_W$ equals $2$ times the covariance matrix of $W$ , and therefore $f_W$ is convex as the sum of convex functions. I am wondering whether the optimization problem $$\begin{array}{ll} \text{maximize} & f_W(R)\\ \text{subject to} & R\mathbb{1}_k = \mathbb{1}_k\\ & W R \geq 0\end{array}$$ where the inequality is component-wise, has a solution and whether this solution is unique up to permutation of columns. I think the answer is ""yes"" if $k=2$ , but I have not been able to say much about the general case $k > 2$ .
Can anyone give me a hint on how to tackle this? Two other expressions for the objective function: We can also write $f_W$ as $$f_W(R) = \frac{1}{n-1} \left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \sum\limits_{l=1}^k \left(\left(WR\right)_{i,l} - \frac{1}{k}\right)^2 - n\sum\limits_{l=1}^k \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{j=1}^n \left(W R\right)_{j,l} - \frac{1}{k}\right)^2\right).$$ So, to maximize $f_W$ , the entries of $WR$ should be as far from $\frac{1}{k}$ as possible under the constraints while its column means should be close to $\frac{1}{k}$ . Another expression for $f_W$ is $$f_W(R) = \frac{1}{n-1} \left(\|WR\|^2 - \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{l=1}^k \left(\sum\limits_{j=1}^n \left(WR\right)_{j,l}\right)^2\right) = \frac{1}{n-1} \left(\|WR\|^2 - \frac{1}{n} \|\mathbb{1}^\top_n WR\|^2\right),$$ where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the Frobenius norm.","['matrices', 'optimization']"

I have a theorem I want to use that applies to regular neighborhoods, and I am unsure if it will still apply to a tubular neighborhood. Hudson's definition for a regular neighborhood is: Let $X$ be a polyhedron contained in the p.l. manifold $M$ , $N \subset M$ . $N$ is a regular neighborhood of $X$ in $M$ if:
1. $N$ is a closed neighborhood of $X$ in $M$ .
2. $N$ is an m-manifold
3. $N$ collapses to $X$ (From Hudson, Piecewise Linear Topology) Rolfsens definition for a tubular neighborhood is: The tubular neighborhood of a submanifold $M^m \subset N^n$ of another manifold $N^n$ is an embedding $t: M \times B^{n-m} \rightarrow N$ such that $t(x,0)=x$ whenever $x \in M$ (From Rolfsen, Knots and Links) My issue is that tubular neighborhoods are open, whereas regular neighborhoods are closed. My understanding is that the two concepts are the same and tubular neighborhoods are a special case of regular neighborhoods.

It already describes the oscillation after ""getting to"" $y=1$ quite well, however, I am facing issues trying to design the dampening according to my needs and transforming this curve in general. Problem Above you can see what $b$ controls - I would say the dampening of the oscillation but also not really. What I want to have control over ideally is only the dampening about $1$ after the function comes back to $y=1$ for the first time, so I want to keep the initial bump past $y=1$ from say $b=0.4$ , but I want more overshoot past $y=1$ afterwards. This is a terrible sketch, but I hope that you see what I mean. The red graph would be what I have now with $b=0.4$ and the blue graph is what I am trying to achieve. I tried a bunch of edits to the equation, but nothing I did got me close to what I want. The graph should keep oscillating about $y=1$ after some time. Observations Changing the factor before the $sin$ will obviously allow me to stretch and compress the whole graph, but that is not what I want. Application The point of this curve is to describe motion from one place to another. An object is supposed to move from say $A$ to $B$ . $A$ is at $y=0$ and $B$ is at $y=1$ . $y=1.1$ would mean that the object moved past the destination (past $B$ ), which is why this is ""elastic"". My goal is to keep the intial elasticity of the bounce, i.e. the overshoot past $B$ , but I also want to have more bounciness when the object oscillates about point $B$ after going beyond it initially.","['curves', 'algebra-precalculus', 'functions', 'graphing-functions']"

Then, we say that the probability that an integer $a\in[1,n]$ is $\frac{1}{\log(n)}$ . Assuming that $a$ and $a+2$ being prime are independent events, the probability of both of them being prime is $\frac{1}{\log^2(n)}$ . However, this is obviously not true since (for example) if $a$ is prime, $a+2$ is more likely to be prime, since it is not divisible by $2$ . We refine this model as follows: given a ""small"" integer $w>0$ we say that the probabily of an integer $a\in[1,n]$ being prime is $0$ if some prime $p\leq w$ divides $a$ and $$\prod_{p\leq w} \left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)^{-1}\frac{1}{\log(n)}$$ otherwise.
Then, we count the number of twin primes smaller than $n$ using this model to get $$2\prod_{p\leq w,\ p\neq 2}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)^{-2}\frac{p-2}{p}\frac{n}{\log^2(n)}.$$ Letting $w\to\infty$ we get the result in the conjecture. What I don't understand is the final counting part. According to my source, the $2$ appears because if $a$ is prime, $a+2$ is odd, and the factor $\frac{p-2}{p}$ appears because out of $p$ numbers, only $p-2$ can be the biggest of a twin prime because the ones congruent to $0$ or $2$ modulus $p$ cannot be.

If there are $N$ floors above the ground floor and if each person is equally likely to get off at any one of these $N$ floors, independently of where the others get off, compute the expected number of stops that the elevator will make before discharging all of its passengers. So, my thought process is as follows. Let $X=$ number of people who enter the elevator. $X \sim Poisson(10)$ . Let $Y=$ the number of stops it takes in total. I define the indicator variable $I_n$ such that it equals $1$ if the elevator stops at a given floor and $0$ otherwise. Then, $Y = I_1 + ... + I_N$ . From what I understand, the goal is to find $E[Y]$ since this essentially gives the expected number of times the elevator will stop. Now, $E[Y] = \sum_{n=1}^N E[I_n] = NE[I_n]$ . Thus, I need to find $I_n$ but this is where I am stuck.

I know that I need to find $E[I_n | X = m]$ somehow, but I am not sure how to do so.

My understanding is that the first part( $f\colon\mathbb R\times \mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ )  means that for any combination of 2 real number $(a,b)$ , it will map to one single Real number.  The second part ( $f(a,b)=a-b$ ) means that the mapping of $(a,b)$ will be ( $a-b$ ).  Am I correct? Second of all, I'm confuse about what this question is even asking.  What does define mean? How do you define a function? Isn't the function already defined in the question Lastly, I know for example that $a-b-c$ is not associative since $(a-b)-c$ is not the same thing as $a-(b-c)$ , however when we only have 1 subtraction, wouldn't it be associative by default since there is only one way to add parentheses to the function (ex.// $(a-b)$ ).","['functions', 'associativity', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Since $\biggl|\sqrt{3}-\dfrac{m}{n}\biggr|$ is equivalent to $\biggl|\dfrac{ \sqrt{3}n-m}{n}\biggr|$ So I performed the following operation $\biggl|\dfrac{\sqrt{3}n-m}{n}\biggr|\cdot \biggl|\dfrac{\sqrt{3}n+m}{\sqrt{3}n+m}\biggr|$ to get $$\biggl|\dfrac{3n^{2}-m^{2}}{\sqrt{3}n^{2}+mn}\biggr|$$ Since $n,m \ne 0$ , we have that $|3n^{2}-m^{2}| \ge 1$ . Now for the denominator, we have $$ |\sqrt{3}n^{2}+mn| \le |\sqrt{3n^{2}}| + |mn| $$ Thus it follows that $$\dfrac{1}{|\sqrt{3}n^{2}+mn|} \ge \dfrac{1}{|\sqrt{3}n^{2}| + |mn|}$$ Would I have to work in cases where $m<n$ , for example? Then we have $$|\sqrt{3}n^{2}| + |mn| < |\sqrt{3}n^{2}| + n^{2} < 3n^{2} + n^{2} < 5n^{2}$$ which gives us the desired result.

Judging from the definition 1, I believe that he was giving $\mathcal{S}'$ the weak* topology . However, I am having a hard time proving that the definition of continuity defined as above matches the continuity in terms of the weak $^*$ topology. If the weak* topology were first countable, the answer would be yes, but unfortunately this is not the case . I asked the professor this question but he said he didn't know the answer. So my question is: What topology, if any, do we usually give $\mathcal{S}'$ ? Is the continuity defined as above the same as the weak* continuity; that is, does sequential continuity of a map $F:\mathcal{S}'\to \mathcal{S}'$ imply the continuity of $F$ when we endow $\mathcal{S}'$ with the weak* topology?

I need to analyze the following two functions. $$(1) \lim_{x \to 0^+}e^{\frac{1}{x}}$$ $$(2) \lim_{x \to 0^-}e^{\frac{1}{x}}$$ I know for a fact that a limit for the first function does not exist because for very small positiv values the term $\frac{1}{x}$ approaches infinity. For the second function a limit does exist. As x approaches very small negative values the term $\frac{1}{x}$ approaches negative infinity. So it follows that $\lim_{x \to 0^-}e^{\frac{1}{x}} = e^{-\infty} = 0.$ However all of these statements are based on intuition and are not formal. 
I tried to use the epsilon-delta proof in order to show a limit does or doesn't exist. For the first function I tried using a contradiction in order to show a limit does not exist. So suppose a limit $L$ does exist and $L > 0$ . If $L > 0$ than there exists a $\delta > 0$ , so that $0 < |x - x_0| < \delta \Leftrightarrow 0 < |x - 0| < \delta \Leftrightarrow 0 < x < \delta$ with $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ . But I don't know how to continue from here. Because normally in an epsilon-delta proof I would now try to find a $\delta$ starting with the term $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ and by using equivalent transformation getting to the term $|x - 0| < \delta$ . However I don't know if this is even the right approach in this case. For the second function I get stuck at the same point. Is it suggestive to even use the epsilon-delta proof for these kind of functions or is there some completely different solution path that is more suitable.","['limits', 'functions', 'epsilon-delta', 'real-analysis']"

Rice gives the following quote from the Los Angeles Times: ""Several studies of sexual partners of people infected with the virus show that a single act of unprotected vaginal intercourse has a surprisingly low risk of infecting the uninfected partner--perhaps one in 100 to one in 1,000. For an average, consider the risk to be one in 500. If there are 100 acts of intercourse with an infected partner, the odds of infection increase to one in five. Statistically, 500 acts of intercourse with one infected partner or 100 acts with five different infected partners lead to a 100% probability of infection (statistically, not necessarily in reality)."" The full article is here . Rice explains that this is flawed by considering just two acts of intercourse: if we let $A_1$ denote the event that infection occurs on the first act and $A_2$ the event infection occurs on the second, then the event that infection occurs is $B = A_1\cup A_2$ and $$P(B) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) - P(A_1\cap A_2) \leq P(A_1) + P(A_2) = {2 \over 500}$$ But I'm still confused: I understand that the above is trying to show that the article is overestimating, but surely the probability of $A_1 \cap A_2$ is $0$ ? You can only be infected with AIDS once... as far as I know. And even if it is not $0$ , what's stopping us from exceeding the $P = 1$ threshold eventually if we take enough events (which clearly seems nonsensical since its intuitively its clear that someone might avoid AIDS indefinitely)?

Let $\phi_t$ be the diffeomorphisms infinitesimally generated by $X$ and recall that $\mathcal{L}_X\omega=\left.\partial_t(\phi_t^*\omega)\right|_{t=0}$ .  Similarly, $[X,Y]=\mathcal{L}_XY=\left.\partial_t(\phi_{-t}^*Y)\right|_{t=0}$ . Now $\iota_{(\cdot_1)}(\cdot_2)$ is bilinear and smooth, so it commutes with the (Gateaux) time derivative when the equation is interpreted sufficiently weakly.
