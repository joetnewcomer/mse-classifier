249880,Convergence of alternating series,"I was provided the following first terms of a series in a question from my math book: $-\frac{2}{5}+\frac{4}{6}-\frac{6}{7}+\frac{8}{8}-\frac{10}{9}+...$ I concluded that this is the equivalent of the following sum representation: $\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^n\frac{2n}{n+4}$ I then proceeded to do the alternating series convergence test by first comparing two following terms: $b_n=\frac{2n}{n+4}$ $b_{n+1}=\frac{2n+2}{n+5}$ I concluded that $b_{n+1}>b_n$ for at least one $n$ and thus the series is divergent. The limit test is also conclusive: $\lim_{n->\infty} \frac{2n}{n+4} = \lim_{n->\infty} \frac{2}{1+\frac{4}{n}} = 2$ Since the limit is not equal to $0$, both alternating series tests point out that the series is in fact divergent. Unfortunately the answer pages in my math book itself say that the series is convergent. Although Wolfram Alpha confirms my thoughts by saying the series is divergent, it shows no proof or method to reach this answer. Have I done everything right and is the series in fact divergent?","['sequences-and-series', 'limits']"

Two sub-questions: a) Using Cramer's Rule, the determinant of $A$ being zero means that a situation of ""Division by zero"" arises. Then, there being no solution is understandable as division by zero is not defined. But it confuses me how then, in any circumstance , the system can have solutions at all, since the formula in Cramer's rule is undefined. Is there an intuitive and insightful explanation? b) Given that $\det(A) = 0 $ , am I right to think that there are infinitely many solutions if and only if the system of equations is homogeneous, i.e. $\vec b = \vec 0$ ?

249953,Simplifiying sum through integral? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Sum with binomial coefficients: $\sum_{k=1}^m  \frac{1}{k}{m \choose k} $ (7 answers) Closed 4 years ago . I wanted to compute the sum $$\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k}\binom{n}{k}.$$
And I thought it would be easiest to do this by making it a function, differentiating it and integrating it then. So I did: $$f_n(a)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k}\binom{n}{k}a^k$$
$$f_n'(a)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\binom{n}{k}a^{k-1}=\frac{(a+1)^n-1}{a}$$
And finally $$f_n(a)=\int\frac{(a+1)^n-1}{a}\mathrm{d}a+C(n)$$ where $C(n)$ is an unknown constant depending on $n$. The first problem is the integral of course, so here it stops. Can anyone help me calculating this integral or is there another way to calculate the sum? EDIT: another approach: I get, using Pascal's identity, $$S(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k}\binom{n}{k}=\frac{1}{n}+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(\frac{1}{k}\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\frac{1}{k}\binom{n-1}{k}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{n}\binom{n}{k}+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{1}{k}\binom{n-1}{k}$$ So I have the recursion $S(n)=\frac{2^n-1}{n}+S(n-1)$, with $S(1)=\frac{2^1-1}{1}$. Thus $$\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k}\binom{n}{k}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{2^k-1}{k}$$ if that might help. Also, $f_n(a)=\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{(a+1)^k-1}{k}$ for the same reason.","['binomial-coefficients', 'summation', 'integration']"

Thank you! (b) $\rightarrow $ (a):  Assume $\lnot$ (a) and let $f: \omega \hookrightarrow A$ be an injection.

250043,"""The set of all true statements of first order logic""","In one of my lectures, the lecturer put a bunch of examples of sets on the board, stuff like the set of all humans, set of all well typed programs in some programming language, the set of all true statements of first order logic, the set of all proofs of them, and the set of all sets. Now, for the last one, he drew a big line through it, claiming that it introduced issues. It would seem to me that the two before also introduce fairly massive issues, but when I asked a friendly academic, he brushed me off without any real explanation, saying there would be no such issues. I'm going to give my argument below; I hope that anyone can either tell me I'm right, or at least tell me how I'm wrong, so I can better understand the mistakes I made. Ok, so it would seem to me that for the set of all true statements of first order logic to be useful to us, it would first be necessary for us to be able to check whether a statement is in the set, and also that it's complement is the set of all false statements of first order logic. Now, by Gödel any formal logical system that can reason about arithmetic must be incomplete (there are true statements of arithmetic that cannot be proved to be true or false in the logical system) or inconsistent (there are statements that can be proved to be both true and false). So, a simple way of proving whether a statement is in the set is to define a proof program. We have our simple laws of inference ($\vee$-introduction, elimination etc), so it's fairly easy to, looking at a proof in FOL see whether the prover's done something not allowed. So, we go through every string of length 1, then every string of length 2, etc until we find a valid proof of the statement; if the program terminates and there are no syntax errors, it is known that the statement is true. To avoid going on forever with statements which are not in the set, we also check to see whether the negation of the formula is true, since by the law of excluded middle, if something's not true it's false. Now, by Gödel, the program must a) go on forever for some statements, since if FOL is incomplete, there will be no proof in the system that certain statements are in the set (even though they are true). or b) there will be certain statements for which testing both the statement and its negation will result in an affirmative answer (i.e. FOL is inconsistent). This implies that a useful set containing all true statements of first order logic cannot exist. At which point have I gone wrong here?","['logic', 'incompleteness', 'elementary-set-theory']"

250078,"Hilbert Adjoint Operator from Riesz Representation Theorem - $T^{*}y=\frac{\left\langle y,Tx\right\rangle }{\left\langle z_{0},z_{0}\right\rangle}z_0$","Kreyszig's Functional analysis seems to introduce the hilbert adjoint operator by means of an explicit representation. I haven't seen this anywhere else and I would like to confirm this explicit solution for the Hilbert adjoint operator, that is $T^*:H_2\rightarrow H_1$ such that $\langle Tx,y\rangle=\langle x, T^*y\rangle, \forall x\in H_1, y\in H_2$. The following discussion is pieced together from 2 theorems from Kreyszig's Introduction to Functional Analysis text. First, statements of the 2 Theorems whose results piece together into the adjoint operator. I've left out some of their details that I didn't deem relevant. 3.8-1 Riesz's Theorem (Functionals on Hilber spaces): Every bounded linear functional $h$ on a Hilbert space $H$ can be
  represented in terms of the inner product, namely,
  $$f\left(x\right)=\left\langle x,z\right\rangle  $$ where $z$  is
  unique and given by
  $$z=\frac{\overline{f\left(z_{0}\right)}}{\left\langle
 z_{0},z_{0}\right\rangle
 }z_{0},\hspace{1em}z_{0}\in\mathcal{N}\left(f\right)^{\perp} $$ ($\mathcal{N(f)}$ is the null space of $f$. $z_0$ is chosen as such so that $\langle x, z \rangle = 0 $ for all $x : f(x)=0$) 3.8-4 Riesz representation: Let $H_{1} , H_{2} $ Hilbert spaces and $h:\ H_{1}\times H_{2}\rightarrow K $ a bounded sesquilinear form.
  Then $h$  has a representation $$h\left(x,y\right)=\left\langle Sx,y\right\rangle $$ The proof from the text considers $\overline{h\left(x,y\right)} $, keeps $x$  fixed (so as if $\overline{h\left(x,y\right)}$  is a function of 1 variable, $y$ ), and then applies Riesz's Theorem (above) such that $$\overline{h\left(x,y\right)}=\left\langle y,z\right\rangle ,\hspace{1em}z=\frac{h\left(x,z_{0}\right)}{\left\langle z_{0},z_{0}\right\rangle }z_{0},\hspace{1em}z_{0}\in\mathcal{N}\left(h\left(x,y\right)\right)^{\perp} $$ and taking conjugates:$$ h\left(x,y\right)=\left\langle z,y\right\rangle  $$ and now we let $z=Sx$ and there we have the unique representation. Now an explicit form for $T^{\star}$: Working backwards from the previous proof (replacing $S$ with $T^{*}$ , $x$  with $y$ ) I have $$T^{*}y=z=\frac{h\left(y,z_{0}\right)}{\left\langle z_{0},z_{0}\right\rangle }z_0,\hspace{1em}z_{0}\in\mathcal{N}\left(h\left(y,x\right)\right)^{\perp} $$ with$$h\left(y,x\right)=\left\langle z,x\right\rangle =\left\langle T^{*}y,x\right\rangle  $$ which, by definition of the Hilbert adjoint operator $$\cdots=\left\langle y,Tx\right\rangle  $$ so does this give us an explicit form for the adjoing operator? i.e. $$T^{*}y=\frac{\left\langle y,Tx\right\rangle }{\left\langle z_{0},z_{0}\right\rangle }z_0,\hspace{1em}z_{0}\in\mathcal{N}\left(\left\langle y,Tx\right\rangle \right)^{\perp} $$ Is this a correct ""explicit"" form of the adjoint operator? the hard part seems to just find the $z_0$. If so, why can't I find this form of the adjoint operator anywhere? It seems difficult to ""solve"" for $T^*$ straight from the definition $\langle Tx,y\rangle=\langle x, T^*y\rangle$ (like as they did in here: Finding the adjoint of an operator , or as I've seen $V^* = A^H$ proved for matrices) Thanks for your help.","['adjoint-operators', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
250092,A set is infinite iff it is equivalent to a proper subset of itself,"A certain section of the chapter ""The Axiom of Choice"" on ""Naive Set Theory"" got me confused: ""[...] The assertion is that a set is infinite if and only if it is equivalent to a proper subset of itself.

My question is the following: How could I ""enrich"" my given probability space $\Omega$ such that I can ensure the existence of iid random variables on this probability space? My idea was the following: Assume that I have a given probability space $(\Omega_1,\mathcal{A}_1,\mathbb{P}_1)$ and a random variable $X:\Omega_1 \to E$ . Now I can construct a probability space $(\Omega_2,\mathcal{A}_2,\mathbb{P}_2)$ such that there exists a sequence of iid random variables $X_n: \Omega_2 \to E$ . Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathbb{P}) := (\Omega_1,\mathcal{A}_1,\mathbb{P}_1) \otimes (\Omega_2,\mathcal{A}_2,\mathbb{P}_2)$ the product space, then $$X_n'(w_1,w_2) := X_n(w_2) \qquad \qquad X'(w_1,w_2) := X(w_1)$$ would still fulfill $X' \sim X$ , $X_n' \sim X_n$ and the random variables $X_n'$ would be independent.

For the x-component, I have $m_av_{1ax} = m_av_{2ax} + m_bv_{2bx}$. Plugging in the given values for this component gives $2 = \cos\alpha + 1.341\cos\beta$. (note that I left out units for mass and velocity vectors, but those should cancel anyway since it is a ratio of mass times velocity) For the y-component, I have $m_bv_{1by} = m_av_{2ay} + m_bv_{2by}$. Plugging in the given values for this component gives $0 = \sin\alpha - 1.341\sin\beta$ The book recommends solving this with simultaneous equations, but I am not sure how to do this when working with angles. Their hint suggests solving for beta first: $$ \cos\beta = \frac{2-\cos\alpha}{1.341}$$ $$ \sin\beta = \frac{\sin\alpha}{1.341}$$
And then using Pythagorean theorem by squaring both $\cos$ and $\sin$:
$$\cos^2\beta + \sin^2\beta = 1$$
However, I am still not clear on how to isolate the angle for $\alpha$ when substituting the above definitions for $\cos\beta$ and $\sin\beta$.

$\sum_{n=1}^N n^{-s}$ converge conditionally for some value $s=\sigma+it$ with $\sigma\le 1$? (We must at least have $t\ne 0$ of course.) Partial summation does not work because $\cos(t\log n)$ does not have bounded sums, but I wonder if perhaps at least for $\sigma=1$ and some $t\ne 0$ we may have convergence. 1st Edit: I insist that I am not interested in absolute convergence, which I understand. I really want to know if enough cancellation occurs in the complex powers $n^{1+it}$, $t\ne 0$ for the ordered sequence of partial sums to converge—i.e. for the series to converge conditionally. I guess that this issue may be related to elementary estimates used to prove the prime number theorem (like those of Erdős and Selberg)—even if none implies conditional convergence. 2nd Edit: To recap, conditional convergence at $\sigma$ of a Dirichlet series $\sum_{n\ge 1} a_nn^{-s}$, with real $a_n$ implies no pole on the real half-line at the right of $\sigma$ so the abscissa of absolute and conditional convergence of the Dirichlet series representations (which is unique, a nontrivial result) for Riemann's $\zeta$ are the same, $1$, i.e. the series does not converge conditionally for $\sigma<1$. I will also mention that the Dirichlet series $\sum_{n\ge 1}(-1)^nn^{-s}$ has abscissa of conditional convergence $0$ (therefore no pole at the right of $0$), and dividing it by $2^{1-s}-1$ we obtain $\zeta(s)$, so this is close to a Dirichlet series evaluation of $\zeta$—which are known not to be practical computationally. I could find interesting results in Tenenbaum's book on analytic number theory. I guess I will have to look at the heavy weight references, specialized on Riemann's zeta-function. The case of $\sigma=1$ and $t\ne 0$ is still unsettled in the answers to this question, and in my mind. 3rd Edit: This question on mathoverflow seems to address exactly my question: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/84097/divergence-of-dirichlet-series The conclusion, there, is that the series diverges also for $t\ne 0$.

250606,Why Characterize Structure Preserving Functions in Terms of Pre-images?,"In Analysis, functions are often characterized as ""structure-preserving"" if structures from codomains are preserved into the domain under the preimage operation.  Specifically, if we let $f: (A, S_1) \rightarrow (B, S_2)$ be a function s.t. $S_1 \subseteq P(A)$ and $S_2 \subseteq P(B)$, then we say that $f$ is ""structure preserving"" if for any arbitrary $s_2 \in S_2$ we have that $f^{-1}(s_2) \in S_1$.  For example, we could let $S_1, S_2$ characterize the open subsets of $A,B$ and consider that the notion of ""continuity"" is that of ""any open subset of $B$ has associated with it an open subset of $A$ under the pre-image operation"".  Alternatively, we could let $S_1$ and $S_2$ characterize measurable subsets of $A$ and $B$ respectively and consider that the notion of ""measurable function"" is characterized as ""a function in which the preimage of a measurable subset of $B$ is itself measurable in $A$"". But why do we characterize the notion of ""structure preserving"" in terms of pre-images instead of images?  Why not, for example, say that our function $f$ is structure preserving if for some $s_1 \in S_1$ we have that $f(s_1) \in S_2$?
