676242,when to use sine vs cosine vs tangent,"I'm a little confused about how you choose to use either sine or cosine or tangent over the others. Are they interchangeable given the same information you have about a right triangle? What are the circumstances that should dictate the use of one over the other? Or is it preference? If you know the sides you can work out the angles. If you know the angle you can work out the length of the sides. Is this a correct assumption?  So, is it correct so assume that if you know one of the angles besides the 90 degree angle and 1 length of one side you can determine the sine, cosine and tangent of that triangle? And if you know two sides you can always determine the angle? Is that a correct assumption?","['trigonometry', 'triangles']"

Scratch-work here: $\color{darkred}{\text{ I understand the formal proof.

We can bound $|x - 13|$ for any choice of D, but we need a certain D to also bound $|\sqrt{x-4} + 3|$. 1. Ishfaaq's answer says 'the denominator will definitely cause trouble.' How? Why won't bounding $|x - a|, |x - 13|$ bound the whole statements? Beneath pp 83 of Spivak claims this too. How does '$|x + a|$ cause trouble'? Assume that $D < 1.$ 2. What sanctioned assuming $D < 1$? How to know if $1$ is too small, too big? $\\$ In pp 83 of Spivak beneath, $D$ looks randomly chosen? 4. Ishfaaq's last paragraph. $\color{darkred}{\left|{x^2 - a^2}\right| \lt \delta^2 + \left|{}2a\right|\delta. \text{ But we can hardly equate this to ϵ... }}$ Why not? $d^2 + \left|{}2a\right|d = e \iff d(d + |2a|) = e$? Ishfaaq says $a = 1/2, e = d/2$ is a counterexample. But then $d^2 + 2|a|d < e \iff d^2 + d < d/2 \iff d(d - \frac{1}{2}) < 0 \iff 0 < d < 1/2.$ What founders? If this works, then any smaller D will also work.
  Then $|x - 13| < 1 \iff -1 < x - 13 < 1 \iff 12 < x < 14 \iff 8 < x - 4 < 10$ $\implies \sqrt(8) < \sqrt{x - 4} < \sqrt(10) \iff  \color{blue}{\sqrt(8) + 3 < \sqrt{x - 4} + 3 < \sqrt(10) + 3} \\ \iff  0 < \color{blue}{\dfrac{1}{\sqrt(10) + 3} < \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x - 4} + 3} < \dfrac{1}{\sqrt(8) + 3}} $
  $\implies \color{green}{\frac{1}{|\sqrt{x - 4} + 3|} < \frac{1}{\sqrt(8) + 3}} $ So then $|x - 13|\color{green}{\dfrac{1}{|\sqrt{x - 4} + 3} < \dfrac{1}{\sqrt(8) + 3}}|x - 13|$ and need this $ < E.$ Thus, we need $|x - 13| < E * \color{green}{(\sqrt{8} + 3)}$. So this is our choice of D. But note that this only works when $D < 1$. Thus, we can take care of both conditions by choosing $D = \min\{1, E(\sqrt{8}+3)\}.$ █ $\color{darkred}{ \text{ 3.

676601,A subset of $\Bbb R^p$ is open iff it is the union of a countable collection of open balls,"I am studying analysis on my own and need some help verifying the solution to the above exercise found in Bartle's Elements of Real Analysis . I know there are other posts answering the same question but I need some criticism of my attempt if someone is kind enough to read through it for me. I also am in need of some advice on whether my terminology is alright. I have also chosen to interpret an open set in $\Bbb R ^ p$ to mean a set such that to each of its points there is an open ball centred at that point entirely contained in the original set. Is this fine?? And also I found it very difficult to come up with a proof of this exercise - Took me a good couple of days but did do it entirely on my own. Should I learn a first course on Analysis described in Cartesian space or should I begin with something like Abbott or Strichartz which focus just on the real line first?? Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance. Here is my proof. The absolute value sign ""$ \left| {x} \right|$"" stands for the standard Euclidean norm. Proof: Let $J \subseteq \Bbb R^p$ be an open ball. Then there exists $r \gt 0$ such that  $J = \{ y \; | \; \left| { y - x} \right| \lt r\}$ for some point $x \in J$. For every point $ y \in J$, $ \; r_y = r - \left| { y - x} \right| \gt 0 $. Consider the open ball $J_y = \{ z \; | \; \left| { z - y} \right| \lt  r_y  \}$ centered  at $y$. $ \; z \in J_y \implies \left| { z - y} \right| \lt r_y \implies \left|{(z - x) - (y - x)}\right| \lt r_y$ $\implies \left|{z - x}\right| - \left|{ y -x}\right| \lt r - \left| { y - x} \right| \implies z \in J \implies $ there is an open ball centered at every point $y \in J_y$ entirely contained in $J_y$. Therefore an open ball is an open set. And since the union of any collection of open sets is open in $\Bbb R ^ p$, the union of countably many open balls is an open set in $\Bbb R ^ p$. Let $G$ be an open set. The set $\{ a_n \}$ of all points in $G$ with rational coordinates is countable. Since each $a_n \in G$ there corresponds an open ball centred at $a_n $entirely contained in G. Let $B_n$ be the largest of these open balls. We shall prove that $$G = \bigcup_{n \in \Bbb N} B_n$$ Since $B_n \subseteq G \;\;\; \forall n \in \Bbb N$, the union is trivially contained in $G$. Let $x = (x_1, x_2, .., x_p) \in G$. Then there is an open ball $B_x = \{ y \in \Bbb R ^ p \ | \ \left| {y - x} \right| \lt  r_x (\gt 0) \}$ centred at $x$ entirely contained in $G$. If $ a_t = (t_1, t_2,.., t_p)$ where $t_i$ is a rational number in the open interval $(x_i - \frac {r_x}{3\sqrt p}, x_i +  \frac {r_x}{3\sqrt p}) $, then since; $$\left| {a_t - x} \right| = \sqrt { \sum_{i=1}^p  (t_i - x_i)^2} \lt \sqrt { \sum_{i=1}^p \frac {(r_x)^2}{ 9p}} \lt r_x$$ $a_t \in B_x \subseteq G$. $B_t$ is the largest open ball centred at $a_t$ entirely contained in $G$. Consider the open ball centred at $a_t$, $K = \{ (l_1, l_2,.. , l_p) \ | \ \left| {l_i - t_i} \right| \lt  \frac {r_x}{2\sqrt p}\}$. Since $\left| {l_i - x_i} \right| = \left| {(l_i - t_i) + (t_i - x_i)} \right| \le \left| {l_i - t_i} \right| + \left| {t_i - x_i} \right| \le \frac {5r_x}{6\sqrt p}$, $K \subseteq B_x \subseteq G \implies K \subseteq B_t$. But clearly $x = (x_1, x_2, ... , x_p) \in K \implies x \in B_t$ for some $t \in \Bbb N \implies G \subseteq \bigcup_{n \in \Bbb N} B_n$ Q.E.D.","['general-topology', 'self-learning', 'real-analysis', 'solution-verification']"

What I know: Via Jensen's inequality that,
$\|f\|_r \le \|f\|_s$ always holds true. For slightly more generality (for those interested, not because it's helpful here...) If $\mu(X) < \infty$ and $1 < r < s < \infty$ then, $\|f\|_r \le \|f\|_s \mu(X)^{\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}s}$, follows from the Holder inequality. Also, clearly $f \equiv 1$ is a solution. What I've tried: After not making any progress trying to find conditions for $\|f\|_s \le \|f \|_r$. I have tried to decompose $X$ to gain information. However, it leads to too many variables to be helpful, but maybe someone can improve my attempt, so here it is. Let $A = \{ x : |f(x)| < 1 \}, B = \{x : |f(x)| = 1 \}$, and $C = \{x : |f(x)| > 1\}$.

&= \left( \int_{A} |f|^r d\mu + \mu(B) + \int_{C} |f|^r d\mu \right)^{1/r} = \|f\|_r.

(I do not know how to make above justification look better) So, sylow subgroup of $S_{2p}$ is of order $p^2$.. I was first thought of seeing for some example May be something like $S_6=S_{2.3}$ Order of sylow $3$ subgroup of $S_6$ is $9$ only possibilities for orders of elements are $3$.. If i take some two arbitrary elements of order $3$ there is a possibility that they do not end up nicely i mean some thing like $$(123)(124)=(13)(42)$$ would happen.. I would take two elements of order $3$ and then end up with an element of order $2$ which would be a problem as a group of order $9$ can not have an element of order $2$ So, I would make sure that those elements do not create any mess and commutes nicely and the choice that comes to my mind is $\{(123),(456)\}$ and the group generated by them is of order $9$ $$\{\langle(123),(456)\rangle\}=\{(123)^i(456)^j : 0\leq i,j\leq 2\}$$ I would like to repeat the same in terms of $S_{2p}$ I would consider first half of $\{1,2,3,\cdots,2p-2,2p-1,2p\}$ as one cycle and second half as another cycle. I mean $\{(123\cdots,p-1,p);(p+1,p+2,\cdots,2p)\}$ These two cycles commutes nicely and do not create any mess giving rise to a subgroup of order $p^2$ namely : $$\{\langle(123\cdots,p-1,p);(p+1,p+2,\cdots,2p)\rangle\}$$ $$=\{(123\cdots,p-1,p)^i(p+1,p+2,\cdots,2p)^j : 0\leq i,j\leq p-1\}$$ So, I guess this is good enough.. $|S_{p^2}|=(p^2)!=(p^2)(p^2-1)\cdots (p^2-p)\cdots (p^2-2p)\cdots (p^2-(p-1)p) \cdots 4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot 1$ i.e., $|S_{p^2}|=p^2\cdot p(p-1)\cdot p(p-2)\cdots p(1)m$ where $p\nmid m$ i.e., we have $p^2\cdot p^{p-1}=p{p+1}$ number of $p$ in factorization of $(p^2)!$ So, now the order is known and we need to find the subgroup... I would repeat the same idea as of $S_{2p}$ For the same reason as that of $S_{2p}$ I would take for $S_{9}=S_{3^2}$the set $\{(123),(456),(789)\}$. But then $\{\langle (123),(456),(789)\rangle\}=\{(123)^i(456)^j(789)^k : 0\leq i,j,k\leq 2\}$ is giving me a subgroup of order $27$ where as i need a group of order $81$ (which is the order of sylow $3$ subgroup of $S_{9}$ i.e.$3^{3+1}$) so, It sounds some thing like I should take an element of order $3$ which behaves nicely and does not create much problem and give a subgroup of order $81$ I am sure that any $3$ sylow subgroup of $S_9$ would have a copy isomorphic to  $\{\langle (123),(456),(789)\rangle\}$ so only problem is i am not sure how to extend this to a subgroup of order $81$ More generally for $S_{p^2}$ I would consider $$\{\langle(123\cdots p)(p+1\cdots 2p)\cdots (p^2-p+1\cdots p^2)\rangle\}$$ This would give a subgroup of order $p^p$ but then i need a subgroup of order $p^{p+1}$.

677085,For each $y \in \mathbb{R}$ either no $x$ with $f(x) = y$ or two such values of $x$. Show that $f$ is discontinuous.,"This is from Apostol's Mathematical Analysis. Let $f$ be a function defined in $[0, 1]$ such that for each real number $y$ either there is no value of $x \in [0, 1]$ such that $f(x) = y$ or there are exactly two such values of $x$ . Prove that a) $f$ must be discontinuous on $[0, 1]$ . b) $f$ has an infinite number of discontinuities in $[0, 1]$ . Long back I had tried to solve the problem. I reasoned for a) as follows: Suppose that $f$ is continuous and let $m, M$ be its minimum and maximum values on $[0, 1]$ . Clearly if $m = M$ then $f$ is constant and clearly for every $x \in [0, 1]$ we have $f(x) = m = M$ which contradicts given property of $f$ . So we must have $m < M$ . Clearly there are now four distinct points $a, b, c, d$ in $[0, 1]$ such that $f(a) = f(b) = m, f(c) = f(d) = M$ . By checking possible linear orderings of $a, b, c, d$ I could find a find a value of $y \in (m, M)$ for which there exist more than 2 values of $x$ such that $f(x) = y$ . However this approach looks very clumsy and I suspect much simpler and easier proof is possible. Part b) seemed bit complex and my only guess was that probably $f$ was discontinuous on each subinterval of $[0, 1]$ but I could not prove this claim (may be the claim is wrong!). Perhaps there is a simpler solution to this part of the problem. Apostol's also asks to provide an example of such a function. Any hints on the overall problem will be appreciated. Update : After looking at Marc's answer, I think I have found a way to show that there are infinitely many discontinuities. Earlier the solution was a part of the question itself but it made the question look quite lengthy hence I moved it to a separate answer.","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"

I know only roughly what the initial and final values should be and how I want the function’s shape of the graph to look, but everything I’ve tried either grows too fast or continues growing well after my final values. It’s been several years since I’ve done anything beyond basic algebra, derivatives and matrix operations, but (with the help of Google), I remember the basic function transformations ( $af(x - h) + v$ ). However, these do not seem to help much, as I’m still having trouble coming up with a formula such that the output scales appropriately. All of my attempts involved starting with a “basic” function which has a similar shape to what I’d like ( $\ln(x)$ , $\sqrt x$ , $1/x$ , etc.), then applying transforms in an attempt to make it play nice. When that didn’t work, I tried using an exponential to get a function that grows up to (roughly) my maximum ( $\max \times (1 - e^{-x})$ ). Like the first attempts, this still ended up growing too quickly. So, I’m at a loss. I don’t remember the process I should be using to get the function I’m looking for and it feels like I’m just trying stuff randomly at this point. How do I go about building this thing? Also, I apologize for being vague with my information. I’d like to provide more details, but there simply aren’t any. This is for a game I’m attempting to develop, so the values aren’t set in stone, nor is the shape I’ve suggested. I’ll probably end up repeating this process as I find myself needing different values and growth, hence my focus on the process rather than a concrete solution. Edit: A simple example that might help express my intent:
The function in question is to be used for a bonus reward to be given to a player as they build a chain of “kills” or victories. I expect players to easily build chains around 1-10 without much effort, so I want there to be some noticeable growth to show the player that longer chains $=$ higher reward. At chains of around 60-80 is where I’d like to see the reward maximize. The problem (and why I’ve not stated these values up to now) is that certain victories aren’t worth as much as others, to prevent players from beating on weaker players for easy rewards. So their chain is expressed with a point system: That 1-10 chain will be somewhere around 80-120 points, and the 60-80 chains will be around 550-750.
In terms of the function/graph, the input/ $x$ is the player’s current chain in points and the output/ $y$ is the reward.

677740,Conclusion from trigonometric identity,"Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be angles in triangle, i.e $\alpha, \beta \in \left(0,\pi\right)$ can we conclude that $\alpha = \beta$ if the following statement is true: $$\left(\frac{\sin \alpha}{\sin \beta}\right)^{100}= \frac{\sin^2 \frac {\alpha}{2}}{\sin^2 \frac{\beta}{2}}$$ For me this looks too obvious, but I'm unable to solve it for hours.","['trigonometry', 'triangles']"
