4618256,Integral transform for finding what polynomial solves a differential equation.,"If the following kind of differential equations: $$
\frac{d^2f}{d^2t} + \frac{df}{dt} + f = 0 \\
$$ Have a solution made up by a linear combination of exponentials; which can be easily find by using the laplace transform: $$
\mathcal L\{ f(t) \} = \int_{0}^{\infty} { f(t) e^{-st} dt} \\
$$ I was wondering if, assuming the solution of the following differential equation: $$
t^2\frac{d^2f}{d^2t} + t\frac{df}{dt} + f = 0
$$ Is a linear combinations of terms like: $$
f(t) = A t^r
$$ Could be silly to define a transform like this: $$
J\{ f(t) \} \equiv \int_{0}^{\infty} { f(t) \; t^{s} dt} \\
$$ My problem is: $$
J\{ tf'(t) \} = \int_{0}^{\infty} { f'(t) \; t^{s + 1} dt} = t^{s + 1} f(t)\Bigg |_{t = 0}^{\infty} - (s + 1) \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t) \; t^{s} dt
$$ This integral do not converge, so I cannot find the solution of the equation. Is is possible to assume that: $$
\lim_{t \to \infty} t^{s + 1} f(t) = 0
$$ It is possible to apply this transform, or it is a non-sense? I was expecting something like (take this as an example): $$
\hat{f}(s) = \frac{s^2 f''(0) + s f'(0)}{s^2 - s + 1} 
$$ And last but not least, how would I find the inverse transform?",['ordinary-differential-equations']
4618282,Does partial maximization/minimization always give the the same result as global optimization?,"Suppose I want to optimize the function,f(x), where x is a vector. x can be seperated into two sub-vectors, $(x)=(x_{1},x_{2})$ . I can first partially optimize $x_{1}$ , and treat $x_{2}$ as constant, so that I get the optimal $x^{*}_{1}$ as a function of $x_{2}$ .Then I can optimize the object function as a function of $x_{2}, i.e. f(x^{*}_{1}(x_{2}),x_{2})$ . My question is does this always give the same result, as I directly optimize f(x) over x? Can this be proved?

4618283,Splitting six friends into two pairs and two singles,"Six friends agree to meet at the hotel Acropolis in Athens. It happens that there are four hotels with the same name. Each of the six friends picks one hotel at random and goes there. What is the probability that two friends end up alone and the rest four in pairs? My solution: Since we have 6 friends and 4 possible choices for each the sample space consists of $4^6$ possible events. There are $\binom{6}{2}$ choices for the first pair and $4$ hotel choices. There are $\binom{4}{2}$ choices for the second pair and $3$ hotel choices. There $\binom{2}{1}$ choices for the first single person and $2$ hotel choices. The last person has only one hotel choice. Since we have four groups and we do not care about order, we have to divide our results by $4!$ . Putting it all together: $$
P(A) = \frac{\frac{4\binom{6}{2}3\binom{4}{2}2\binom{2}{1}1}{4!}}{4^6} \approx 0.0439

4618370,Probability of winning a game guessing $k$ random numbers in sequence with optimal strategy,"We are playing a game as follows, suppose we have $k$ spaces. One at a time, we will pick $k$ random integers from the range $[1,n]$ , without replacement. After selecting a number, we must choose to place it in one of our spaces before selecting the next number. We ""win"" if after selecting our $k$ numbers, our sequence on our spaces is in increasing order. Here is an example of a winning game where $n=10, k=3$ . Initial state: _ _ _ Randomly select $5$ , place in middle slot: _ $5$ _ Randomly select $6$ , place in last slot: _ $5$ $6$ Randomly select $1$ , place in first slot: $1$ $5$ $6$ Note that had the last number been a $7,8,9,10$ instead of $1$ , then we would have lost as none of those values are $<5$ . Clearly, if you are just randomly selecting the slot at every iteration, the probability of winning is $\frac{1}{k!}$ . However, we can do better by having good strategy; why place a $1$ in the last slot when thats an instant loss, for example. Define $P(n,k)$ to be the maximum probability of winning the game given $k$ slots and $n$ random numbers. When we say ""maximum probability"" we mean that whenever we select a random number, we put it in the slot where from there we have the highest probability of winning the game. Edit: I have since realized I need more base cases. $P(n,0)=1$ and $P(j,k)=0$ if $j<k$ . $P(j, j)=1$ We will prove our formula recursively with induction. Notice that in our base case, $P(n, 1)=1$ for all values of $n$ . Assume that for all values of $m<n$ and $j<k$ that $P(m, j)$ provides the maximum probability of winning for $j$ slots with selection $[1,m]$ . We now define the formula for the $n,k$ case. We have $n$ options for what we can pick as our first number, for the sake of argument suppose we selected the number $x\in[1,n]$ . With this first number we can now calculate the probability of winning the $n, k$ case, given our first selected number is $x$ . Notate this as $P(n,k;x)$ [^1]. Since there is a $\frac{1}{n}$ chance of selecting any particular $x$ , we know that $$
P(n,k) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{x=1}^n P(n,k;x)
$$ Now to calculate $P(n,k;x)$ , we must determine the optimal location to place $x$ in the slots. If I was to place $x$ in slot $i$ , I would partition the board into two sections, one of length $i-1$ on the left, and one of length $k-i$ on the right. In order to win, we must select exactly $i-1$ numbers to place on the left that are $<x$ , and exactly $k-i$ numbers on the right that are $>x$ , otherwise we lose as we have placed $x$ in the wrong spot for our selected numbers. The probability of this occuring is $$
\frac{\binom{x-1}{i-1}\binom{n-x}{k-i}}{\binom{n-1}{k-1}}
$$ However, just getting the correct numbers is not enough, as we must put them in the correct locations, but these partitioned boards are equivilent to playing the same game twice! So if we get valid numbers (per above) we only need to win the partitioned boards in order to win the game. Since $x-1, n-x < n$ and $i-1, k-i<k$ we can use our inductive hypothesis to say that the probability of winning if we place $x$ in slot $i$ is $$
\frac{\binom{x-1}{i-1}\binom{n-x}{k-i}}{\binom{n-1}{k-1}}P(x-1, i-1)P(n-x, k-i).
$$ In order to optimize our strategy, we select the $i$ for which this value is maximized which gives us $$
P(n,k;x)=\max_{1\leq i\leq k}\left[\frac{\binom{x-1}{i-1}\binom{n-x}{k-i}}{\binom{n-1}{k-1}}P(x-1, i-1)P(n-x, k-i)\right]
$$ Which means we can sum over all values of $x$ and divide by $n$ to get the value of $P(n,k)$ Q.E.D. This recursive formula was also not too tough to program up, here is a plot of when $n=50$ , notice that the y axis is a log plot so the variations can be seen. Minimal solution is when $k=35$ with $P(50,35)\approx 3.28\cdot 10^{-5}$ $n=50$ "" /> As an aside, has anyone seen this before?

4618448,"Are the ""bounded, uniformly continuous functions"" analogous to test functions as seen in Schwartz Distributions?","I am reading this passage from Billingsley's Convergence of Probability measures. Theorem 1.2. Probability measures $P$ and $Q$ on $\mathcal{S}$ coincide if $P f=Q f$ for all bounded, uniformly continuous real functions $f$ . Proof. For the bounded, uniformly continuous $f$ of (1.1), $P F \leq$ $P f=Q f \leq Q F^\epsilon$ . Letting $\epsilon \downarrow 0$ gives $P F \leq Q F$ , provided $F$ is closed. By symmetry and Theorem $1.1, P=Q$ . Because of theorems like this, it is possible to work with measures $P A$ or with integrals $P f$ , whichever is simpler or more natural. We defined weak convergence in terms of the convergence of integrals of functions, and in the next section we characterize it in terms of the convergence of measures of sets. Are the ""bounded, uniformly continuous"" analagous to the ""test functions"" $C_c^\infty(X)$ seen in the ""theory of distributions?

4618458,Basic questions in Real Analysis,"I started studying Real Analysis 3 and stumbled on the new definition of differentiability, approximation by line/plane. It seems easy to digest but I have some questions about it. Is $f(x,y)=x$ differentiable at $(0,0)$ ? I think it should be differentiable but I keep getting, it's not differentiable: $f(h_a,h_b)=f(0,0)+\alpha0+\beta0+g(0,0,h_a,h_b)$ gives that $g(0,0,h_a,h_b)=h_a$ and $g(0,0,h_a,h_b)$ divided by norm of $h$ approaches $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ if I take $h_a=h_b$ . Here, $g(a,b,h_a,h_b)$ is the error term and $f(a,b)+\alpha h_a+\beta h_b$ represents my plane for approximating the value of $f(a+h_a,b+h_b)$ . Is it not differentiable? --- This has been answered. Another question, let's say the partial derivative of a function w.r.t. $x$ and $y$ is $0$ . Based on my knowledge and physics background, I see that function is not changing along the $x$ and $y$ -axis. Doesn't it imply our particle at origin is not moving at all? If it changes in any direction then it must have components along the $x$ and $y$ -axis but there are no changes in those directions. Doesn't it imply that the function must be differential at the origin if partial derivatives are $0$ ? I know, there exist some continuous functions with partial derivatives $0$ at origin and are non-differentiable.","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"

4618529,Uniform Choice Functions and Naturality,"Some choice functions can be specified explicitly, while in other cases no definite choice function is known. An example of the former is a choice function for non-empty subsets of natural numbers, where one can always pick the smallest element. An example of the latter is a choice function for non-empty subsets of real numbers. A common intuition is that these explicit choice functions have uniform definitions (or at least the number of non-uniform cases must be limited). This is reminiscent of natural transformations, which can capture the idea of a morphism defined uniformly with respect to objects in a category. Is there a way to formalize the uniformity intuition for definite choice functions?

I.e. for any $a,b\neq e$ in $G$ , there exists some $f \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$ such that $f(a) = b$ . Is it then necessarily the case, that $G$ is a vector space (over $\mathbb F_p$ or $\mathbb Q$ )? If $G$ is finite, this is the case (cf. Groups with transitive automorphisms ) but I don‘t know how to prove it for infinite $G$ or how to construct a counterxample. I can show that either $k=\mathbb F_p$ or $k=\mathbb Q$ embeds into $G$ , but then I am stuck. I tried constructing a maximal embedding $k^I \to G$ of some vector space into $G$ via Zorn’s lemma, but given two embeddings $f,g \colon k \to G$ with disjoint image I can’t show whether $f \times g $ defines an embedding of $k^2$ into $G$ and this is the crucial step missing in applying Zorn’s lemma.

$$ The above example corresponds to the LHS of the case $n=3$ of this problem. I haven't push forward this question much, all I can prove is the case $n=2$ , which is immediately true by AM-GM. For $n=3$ , I tried to homogenise the inequality and use the 'SOS' method(Sum Of Squares), but it's apparent that this attempt can't be generalised. I've managed to solved the $n=3$ case by the $pqr$ method. First, note the identity $$
\sum_{\text{sym}}{a^3b^2c}=abc(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca)-3(abc)^2
$$ Let $p:=a+b+c,~q:=ab+bc+ca,~r:=abc$ , the inequality is equivalent to $$
pqr-3r^2\leqslant 6
$$ By Schur's Inequality of degree 3, we have $$
a(a-b)(a-c)+b(b-a)(b-c)+c(c-a)(c-b)=p^3-4pq+9r\geqslant0
$$ From this we may obtain $q\leqslant(p^3+9r)/(4p)$ , and as constrained we have $p=3$ ,these reduce the inequality to $$
3r^2-3r~\left(\frac{27+9r}{12}\right)+6=3(r-1)(r-8)\geqslant0
$$ By AM-GM, we obtain $r\leqslant(p/3)^3=1$ ,which proves the inequality. Here's a proof on the site 'zhihu', I've reposted it as community wiki. This proof is invalid because its lemma is wrong. Thanks to Sangchul Lee, this inequality is not true for $n\geqslant6$ , which means the cases $n=4$ and $n=5$ might be very difficult to prove.","['algebra-precalculus', 'inequality']"
4618600,Unbiased estimator of a complex function,"Let $X_1, X_2 \cdots X_N$ be random variables, which follow a Gaussian distribution. \begin{equation}
X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)

I know that the unbiased estimator of $\mu$ is \begin{equation}

U = \frac{1}{N-1}\left((X_1 -\bar{X})^2 \cdots (X_N -\bar{X})^2\right)

f = \frac{1}{\sigma^2 + \sigma_t^2} 
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mu -\mu_t)^2(\sigma^2 + \sigma_t^2)^{-1}\right)
\end{equation} , where $\mu_t$ and $\sigma_t^2$ are known parameters. I'm not sure how to obtain the unbiased estimator of $f$ . The simplest case is when $\mu$ is a known parameter and $\mu = \mu_t$ .
In this case, \begin{equation}
f = \frac{1}{\sigma^2 + \sigma_t^2}
\end{equation} and I'd like to calculate the mean value of $\tilde{F}=\frac{1}{U + \sigma_t^2}$ \begin{equation}

So, my question is how to obtain the unbiased estimator of $f$ how to calculate $E[\tilde{F}]$ Either one or the other answer is fine. I faced this problem when I was studying quantum mechanics. Gaussian quantum states can be represented by Gaussian distributions of operators of $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$ . A vector of the mean values of these operators can be defined as $\boldsymbol{m} = (\left<\hat{x}\right>, \left< \hat{p}\right>)^{\top}$ and the covariance matrix can be defined as \begin{equation}
V = 
\begin{pmatrix}
(\Delta \hat{x})^2 & \Delta \hat{x} \Delta \hat{p} \\
\Delta \hat{p} \Delta \hat{x} & (\Delta \hat{p})^2
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation} Fidelity $f$ , which is a measure of closeness between two quantum states, can be written as \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
f&=
\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{\operatorname{det}\left(V_1+V_2\right)}} \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\boldsymbol{m}_1-\boldsymbol{m}_2\right)^\top\left(V_1+V_2\right)^{-1}\left(\boldsymbol{m}_1-\boldsymbol{m}_2\right)\right] \\
&0 \le f \le 1
\end{split}
\end{equation} If the two states are the same ( $\boldsymbol{m}_1 = \boldsymbol{m}_2$ , $V_1 = V_2$ ), the fidelity is 1 since $\operatorname{det} V=(\frac{\hbar}{2})^2$ .
The Gaussian states can be defined using two parameters $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$ , but the question is changed to one parameter in order to make the problem simpler.","['statistics', 'parameter-estimation']"

(given without proof) in this note. Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a sub- $\sigma$ -field of $\mathcal{F}$ and $X, Y$ two random variables such that $X$ is independent of $\mathcal{G}$ and $Y$ is $\mathcal{G}$ -measurable. Let $\varphi: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be Borel-measurable such that $\mathbb{E}[|\varphi(X, Y)|] < \infty$ . Then $$
\mathbb{E}[ \varphi(X, Y) | \mathcal{G}] = \psi(Y) \quad \text { a.s.} \quad \text{where} \quad \psi(y) := \mathbb{E}[ \varphi(X, y)].
$$ In below attempt, I'm stuck at showing $$
\int_\mathbb R \left[ \int_\mathbb R \varphi (x,y) \diff \color{blue}{\mu'}(x) \right ] \mathrm d \nu'(y) = \int_\mathbb R \left[ \int_\mathbb R \varphi (x,y) \diff \color{blue}{\mu}(x) \right ] \mathrm d \nu'(y).
$$ Could you elaborate on how to finish the proof? Proof Let $\mu, \nu$ be the distributions under $\mathbb P$ of $X, Y$ respectively. We have $X, Y$ are independent and thus the distribution $\lambda$ of $(X, Y)$ is the product measure of $\mu$ and $\nu$ , i.e., $\lambda = \mu \otimes \nu$ . By Fubini's theorem, $\varphi(X, y)$ is integrable for $\nu$ -a.e. $y\in Y$ and the map $y \mapsto \mathbb{E}[ \varphi(X, y)]$ is Borel. Clearly, $\psi(Y)$ is $\mathcal G$ -measurable. Fix $A \in \mathcal G$ . Let's prove that $$
\int_A \varphi (X, Y) \diff \mathbb P = \int_A \psi(Y) \diff \mathbb P.
$$ Let $\mathcal G'$ be the sub- $\sigma$ -algebra of $\mathcal G$ induced by $A$ and $\mathbb P'$ the restriction of $\mathbb P$ to $\mathcal G'$ . We now consider integration w.r.t. $(A, \mathcal G', \mathbb P')$ . Clearly, $$
\int_A \varphi(X, Y) \diff \mathbb P = \int_A \varphi(X, Y) \diff \mathbb P'
\quad \text{and} \quad
\int_A \psi(Y) \diff \mathbb P = \int_A \psi(Y) \diff \mathbb P'.
$$ Notice that $X,Y$ are still independent under $(A, \mathcal G', \mathbb P')$ . Let $\mu', \nu'$ be the distributions under $\mathbb P'$ of $X, Y$ respectively. Then the distribution of $(X, Y)$ under $\mathbb P'$ is $\lambda' :=\mu' \otimes \nu'$ . By change of variables formula and Fubini's theorem, $$
\int_A \varphi (X, Y) \diff \mathbb P' = \int_{\mathbb R^2} \varphi (x,y) \diff \lambda(x, y) = \int_\mathbb R \int_\mathbb R \varphi (x,y) \diff \mu'(x) \diff \nu'(y).
$$ By change of variables formula, $$
\int_A \psi(Y) \diff \mathbb P' = \int_\mathbb R \psi(y) \diff \mathbb \nu'(y) = \int_\mathbb R \left[ \int_\Omega \varphi (X,y) \diff \mathbb P \right ] \mathrm d \nu'(y) = \int_\mathbb R \left[ \int_\mathbb R \varphi (x,y) \diff \mu(x) \right ] \mathrm d \nu'(y).

4618610,Permutation analog of a character table,"I’m trying to learn a little bit about representation theory because it sometimes comes up in discussions in some math hobby groups that I’m in. I have no background in representation theory and my question is really, really naive. I don’t know how to compute a character table for a small, easy-to-work-with group by hand. Is there an analog to a character table for permutation representations and is it simpler to compute by hand? Richard Borcherds’ first lecture on representation theory introduces some of the basic concepts and constructs a character table for $S_3$ at 20m25s . $$
  \begin{array}{lccc}
    & \begin{matrix} \\ \\ \mathrm{id} \end{matrix}

    \chi_2 & 1 & -1 & \phantom{-}1 \\
    \chi_3 & 2 & \phantom{-}0 & -1
  \end{array}
$$ And then he says some facts about this table that I find absolutely amazing: It’s square. The columns are orthogonal. The rows are orthogonal (when weighted by conjugacy class size). I didn’t get this at first, but $\chi_3$ corresponds to the standard representation , which only costs you two dimensions in $\mathbb{C}$ to represent (as opposed to 3 if you do it naively by translating permutations into matrices). What follows is my attempt to build a permutation character table for $S_3$ . Wikipedia’s entry on character tables mentions that the table itself encodes information about irreducible representations over $\mathbb{C}$ . However, you can take traces of matrices in any vector space , this makes me wonder whether it is possible to construct something analogous to this table for permutation representations of $S_3$ . This would be a binary matrix, since traces would give us $1$ or $0$ and would count the parity of the number of fixed points. I’ll call my new pseudo-characters $\psi_1, \psi_2, \dotsc$ We have the identity pseudocharacter $\psi_1$ , which sends everything to $1$ , associated with the trivial permutation representation. We have the representation that sends elements of the transposition conjugacy class to $\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and everything else to the identity matrix. This representation is associated with a pseudocharacter $\psi_2$ which sends everything to $0$ because it’s two-dimensional and two is even. I guess this thing is irreducible as a permutation representation, but I don’t know how to prove it one way or the other. It certainly is not irreducible as a complex representation, though, since it isn’t listed in the above character table. And finally we have the faithful permutation representation, which we use in the above table to name the elements of the conjugacy classes of $S_3$ above. The identity permutation has three fixed points, a transposition has one, and derangements have no fixed points, so $\psi_3$ sends the identity and the transpositions to $1$ and the others to $2$ . We end up with the following table, which is much less nice. $$
  \begin{array}{lccc}
    & \begin{matrix} \\ \\ \mathrm{id} \end{matrix}
    & \begin{matrix} (12) \\[-0.2em] (23) \\[-0.2em] (31) \end{matrix}

    \hline
    \psi_1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    \psi_2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    \psi_3 & 1 & 1 & 0
  \end{array}
$$ We can also count the number of fixed points instead, which is also invariant under conjugation. $$
  \begin{array}{lccc}
    & \begin{matrix} \\ \\ \mathrm{id} \end{matrix}
    & \begin{matrix} (12) \\[-0.2em] (23) \\[-0.2em] (31) \end{matrix}

    \psi_1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    \psi_2 & 2 & 0 & 2 \\
    \psi_3 & 3 & 1 & 0
  \end{array}
$$ Anyway, since our group $S_3$ has three normal subgroups and we are effectively counting the number of fixed points in permutation representations of quotient groups of $S_3$ , I think we can use the above table to tell us what kinds of numbers of fixed points for each conjugacy class are possible in any permutation representation of $S_3$ , for example $\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ is possible if we act on three elements standardly and leave a fourth untouched.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'representation-theory', 'characters']"

They lie in a plane perpendicular to the ground. The middle disk touches the other two disks. Using only paper and pen, approximate the value of $x$ such that the middle disk is tangent to the line that is tangent to and above the other two disks. You may assume that the earth is a sphere of radius $R$ metres. (Before you read the last sentence, it seems like there's something wrong with the question, because it seems like the middle disk should never touch the line. But the ground is actually a circular arc of the earth, so the middle disk is ""pushed up"" and touches the line for some value of $x$ .) The answer turns out to be, elegantly, $x\approx R/2$ . But the algebra seems to be horrendous and I needed to use my computer to find the answer. My attempt Call the angles at the centre of the middle disk $A, B, C, D, E$ with $A$ at the lower-left and going clockwise. $A=\arccos{\left(\dfrac{\left(\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{x-1}\right)^2+\left(R+\frac{1}{x}\right)^2-\left(R+\frac{1}{x-1}\right)^2}{2\left(\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{x-1}\right)\left(R+\frac{1}{x}\right)}\right)}$ $B=\arcsin{\left(\dfrac{\frac{1}{x-1}-\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{x-1}+\frac{1}{x}}\right)}$ $C=\dfrac{\pi}{2}$ $D=\arccos{\left(\dfrac{\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{x+1}}{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{x+1}}\right)}$ $E=\arccos{\left(\dfrac{\left(\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{x+1}\right)^2+\left(R+\frac{1}{x}\right)^2-\left(R+\frac{1}{x+1}\right)^2}{2\left(\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{x+1}\right)\left(R+\frac{1}{x}\right)}\right)}$ We assume that the middle disk is tangent to the line that is tangent to and above the other two disks. This implies: $$A+B+C+D+E=2\pi$$ I am utterly unable to approximate $x$ without a computer, even after attempting to simplify it. And yet the computer-assisted answer is just $x\approx R/2$ .

If this value exists, say set $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) = L$ , we naturally must have that $$\forall \varepsilon > 0 : \exists \delta > 0 : 0 < |x| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon.$$ But, since $f$ is not defined for all $x$ in the set $0 < |x| < \delta$ , the conclusion $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ cannot always be guaranteed to hold. So, I'm inclined to say that the limit $L$ does not exist. That being said, the graph looks like this and based on the graph, $f$ appears to satisfy this inequality: $$\forall x : \frac{\sin x}{x} \leq f(x) < 1$$ Since $\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$ , this suggests in a squeeze-theorem-esque way that $L$ ""wants"" to take the value $1$ , but of course we cannot actually apply the squeeze theorem here for the same reason that we couldn't apply the $\varepsilon$ - $\delta$ definition directly.

For an open set $U\subset\operatorname{Spec}A$ we denote $\mathscr O(U)$ the set of elements $u \in K$ such that for any point $x \in U$ we have an expression $ u=\frac{a}{b}$ with a,b $\in A$ and $b(x)\neq 0$ that is, b is not an element of the prime ideal $x$ .

4619133,"Is there a ""closed form"" expression for the powerset of a complement?","Let us consider some consistent subset of naïve set theory , in which a universal set $U$ exists, the power set $\mathcal{P}(A)$ and complement $A'=U-A$ exists of any set $A$ , on top of the usual binary operations $\cup$ , $\cap$ , $-$ , $\Delta$ (symmetric difference), etc. Considering that $\mathcal{P}(U)=U$ (as $U$ is the universe, rather than some arbitrary domain of discourse), since all subsets of $U$ are elements of $U$ and vice-versa, is there a ""closed-form"" expression for $\mathcal{P}(A')$ ? By ""closed-form"" here, I mean an expression only in terms of $A$ and $U$ under the given operations (so, no set-builder notation). An immediate answer evades me, partly because naïve set theory is often unintuitive, but also because I am sleep deprived (so I apologize If I have overlooked something trivial). We may first ask the question of what exactly $\mathcal{P}(A')$ represents. It is not so hard to deduce that $\mathcal{P}(A')=U-\Gamma$ , where $\Gamma$ is the family of all sets which are not disjoint with $A$ . I.e; $$\Gamma=\{x\in U:x\cap A\neq\emptyset\}.$$ If we were allowed set-builder notation, this would indeed be our answer! However, since we don't, the question becomes whether or not $\Gamma$ can be represented in some closed-form. Equivalently, $$\mathcal{P}(A')=\{x\in U:x\cap A=\emptyset\}$$ can be seen to be the family of all sets which are disjoint with $A$ (which is, IMO, an interesting property!). Whether this is easier to be shown to have or not have a ""closed form"" is not obvious to me, but worth mentioning. Any and all advice to this recreational problem would be greatly appreciated.","['elementary-set-theory', 'nonstandard-models']"

It is known that an $n$ -degree polynomial intersects the function $e^x$ at at most $n+1$ points ( Number of solutions of $P(x)=e^{ax}$ if $P$ is a polynomial ). It follows from the fact that the function $e^x$ has strictly positive $(n+1)$ -order derivative whilst $p^{(n+1)}\equiv 0$ , so $e^x-p(x)$ has strictly positive $(n+1)$ -order derivative. By inspecting the derivatives of the function $f(x)=e^{x^2}$ : \begin{align*}
  f'(x) &= 2x e^{x^2}, \\
  f''(x) &= 2(2x^2+1)e^{x^2} \\
  f'''(x) &= 4x (2x^2+3) e^{x^2},\\

We can therefore conclude that $f$ intersects any $n$ -degree polynomial $p$ at at most $n+1$ points whenever $n$ is odd. And considering interpolation (@GregMartin's comment) we have that: $\phi(n)=n+1$ for $n$ odd.

How to make the middle circle as small as possible?","Non-overlapping circles of radius $1, 2, 3, ..., n$ are all externally tangent to a middle circle. How should we arrange the surrounding circles, in order to minimize the middle circle's radius $R$ ? Take $n=10$ for example. On the left, going anticlockwise the radii are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10$ , and $R\approx 10.77$ . On the right, going anticlockwise the radii are $10, 2, 9, 4, 7, 6, 5, 1, 8, 3$ and $R\approx 9.98$ . How should the circles be arranged to minimize $R$ ? Here is a desmos graph where you can try different arrangements for the case $n=10$ . My attempt For general $n$ , call the radii of the surrounding circles going anti-clockwise, $r_1, r_2, r_3, ..., r_n$ . Draw line segments from the centre of the middle circle to the centre of each surrounding circle. So we have $n$ angles at the centre of the middle circle. Each of these angles can be expressed in terms of $R, r_k, r_{k+1}$ , using the law of cosines . The sum of the $n$ angles is $2π$ . So we have: $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \arccos{\left(\frac{(R+r_k)^2+(R+r_{k+1})^2-(r_k+r_{k+1})^2}{2(R+r_k)(R+r_{k+1})}\right)}=2\pi \text{ (where }r_{n+1}=r_1)$$ This simplifies to: $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \arccos{\left(1-\frac{2r_k r_{k+1}}{(R+r_k)(R+r_{k+1})}\right)}=2\pi$$ We want to assign each $r$ a unique value among $1, 2, 3, ..., n$ so that $R$ is minimized. But how? Is there a general pattern? Conjectured answer I think the following general procedure will make the middle circle as small as possible. Take $n=10$ for example. We ignore the $1$ at first; it will be placed last. First put down the numbers $10, 9, 8, 7, 6$ in pyramid-fashion, from top to down and from left to right, like the red numbers below. Then put down the numbers $2, 3, 4, 5$ in pyramid-fashion also, but between the previous rows, like the blue numbers below. This gives the order of radii going around the circle: $7, 4, 9, 2, 10, 3, 8, 5, 6$ . Then put the circle with radius $1$ anywhere you like, as long as it fits without disturbing other circles. For larger values of $n$ , there may be multiple small circles that can fit between other circles without disturbing them. Put those last. Intuitively, this procedure minimizes the tendency of the large surrounding circles to take up space around the middle circle. You can see this in the diagrams above with $n=10$ , looking specifically at the two largest surrounding circles in each case. Anyway, it's just a conjecture for now. Notice that this conjecture implies that, for $n=10$ , the arrangement I showed above on the right, yields the minimum radius of the middle circle. I don't think the middle circle can be any smaller.","['optimization', 'discrete-geometry', 'circles', 'geometry']"

What I did so far: I found $S_2$ explicitly though not sure it is useful as $S_1$ can’t be found explicitly unfortunately.

4619836,Why are monotonicity and convexity so intensely studied in comparison to their higher-order analogies?,"I've been recently contemplating what can be said about functions $f:\Bbb R \to \Bbb R$ with positive third-order derivative and their properties: It puzzles me why monotonicity and convexity , i.e. the properties associate with the first- and second-order derivatives of a function being positive, are frequently used, whilst  their higher-order alternatives are so rarely referred to. I found that the third-order derivative at a point is called jerk in physics and its meaning is discussed here . I found also a discussion on the topic why are third-order concepts so rare . However, what I'm interested in are the uses of the fact that third-order derivative of $f$ is positive in analysis. For example, whilst strict convexity of $f$ implies that every critical point of $f$ is the unique global minimum of $f$ and that $f$ has at most two roots, having strictly positive third-order derivative would guarantee that every point with $f''(x)=0$ is the unique inflection point of $f$ , that the function has at most one local minimum and one local maximum, and no more than 3 roots. One could argue that it would be informative enough to know that there is $x_2\in \Bbb R$ such that $f''(x_2)=0$ and that $f$ is concave on $(-\infty,x_2]$ and convex on $[x_2,\infty)$ . However, analogously one could argue that convexity is not needed for analyzing function's minima because it is enough to know that there is $x_1\in \Bbb R$ such that $f'(x_1)=0$ and that $f$ is decreasing on $(-\infty,x_1]$ and increasing on $[x_1,\infty)$ . The concept of $n$ -th order convexity (having positive $n$ -th order derivative) is essential for the analysis of the number of roots of one-variable functions: A function with positive $n$-th derivative has at most $n$ roots – an inequality version of the Fundamental theorem of Algebra. Consider the question on what is the maximum number of strict local minima that a degree $k$ polynomial $p(x,y)$ in two variables can have ? In case of quadratic polynomial one can readily answer: The polynomial has a strict local minima only if it is strictly convex, and then the minimum must be unique. In case of cubic polynomial , there is also at most one strict local minimum because if there were two, say at points $a$ and $b$ , then the third degree polynomial $q(t)=p\big((1-t)a+tb\big)$ would need to have two strict local minima – impossible. [1] In case of quartic polynomial , none of the above arguments apply and the only ready estimate follows from applying Bézout's theorem to the partial derivatives of $p$ , and so we can be sure that $p$ has is no more than $3\times 3$ isolated critical points. [2] I expected that the above analysis would be trivial for the case of quadratic polynomials thanks to the concept of convexity. However, the analysis is equally trivial in case of cubic polynomial, the only difference is that there is no name for the ""third-order convexity"" that gives the result. In fact, the analysis becomes difficult as late as in the case of quartic polynomials. This suggests that third-order convexity has practical applications, only the higher-order alternatives would be less practical for the analysis of functions in two or more variables. Does importance of $n$ -th derivative drop? Let me compare the count of search results of terms a) convex b) monotone or monotonic (sum up the count) \begin{array} {|r|r|r|}\hline

The problem, therefore, lies in showing it's reduced, since it's covered by $D(x_i)$ (as $x_i$ are generators). and $D(x_i)$ is affine, the problem reduces to show that the coordinate ring of $D(x_i)$ is reduced, then taking localization will preserve the reducedness. therefore we needs to figure out what $$((k[x_0,...,x_n]/I)_{x_i})_0 \tag{*}$$ is, where the inner subscript ${x_i}$ means taking localization at $x_i$ the outer subscript $0$ means the degree zero part of it. And it's sufficient to prove (*) is reduced. For $I$ is radical iff $(k[x_0,...,x_n]/I)$ is a reduced ring. Since localization preserves reduces, we have $(k[x_0,...,x_n]/I)_{x_i}$ is reduced.

Show that the conditional distribution $\mathcal L\left[\left(X_{(1)} - X_{(n)}, \ldots, X_{(n-1)} - X_{(n)}\right) | X_{(n)}\right]$ does not depend on $X_{(n)}$ and that it equals the (unconditional) distribution of the ordered values of $X_1, \ldots, X_{n-1}$ . Here Distribution of ordered independent exponential random variables there is a theoretical solution. Since I am not able to finish it, I think I am doing something wrong in the conditional law's density calculation. Indeed, for the distribution of the ordered values $X_{(1)},...,X_{(n-1)}$ I get, by integrating out the minumim (please, mind that $X_{(1)}$ is the maximum in the notation used by prof. Klenke) from the joint distribution of the ordered statistics, this density: $f_{X_{(1)},...,X_{(n-1)}}(x_1,...,x_{(n-1)})= n! f_{X_1}(x_1)...f_{X_1}(x_{n-1})F_{X_1}(x_{n-1})=n!e^{-(x_1+...+x_{n-1})}(1-e^{x_{n-1}})$ .

\\\quad \frac{f_{X_{(1)},...,X_{(n-1)},X_{(n)}}(x_1+x_n,...,x_{n-1}+x_n,x_n)}{f_{X_{(n)}}(x_n)}=
\\\quad \frac{n!f_{X_1}(x_1+x_n)...f_{X_1}(x_{n-1}+x_n)f_{X_1}(x_{n})}{{f_{X_{(n)}}(x_n)}}=
\\\quad \frac{n!e^{-(x_1+...+x_{n-1})}e^{-nx_n}}{ne^{-nx_n}}$$ This latter should be equal to the unconditional density that I calculated above. Any suggestions? Edit Could it be something like the following equations based on the iid and “memoryless” properties of the sample? $P[X_{(1)}-X_{(n)}<y_1,…,X_{(n-1)}-X_{(n)}<y_{n-1}| X_{(n)}=x_n]= \\= n!

4620136,Bayesian MAP inference with change of variables theorem,"Question: I want to do a Bayesian inference on a constrained variable. I want to use change of variables theorem to remove the constraint, before doing the Bayesian inference. How does the prior on the variable should change? Context: Say, I have a likelihood function, $P(y|\theta_a, \theta_b)$ . Further suppose that the parameter $\theta_a$ is unconstrained, yet the parameter $\theta_b$ is constrained such that $\theta_b \geq 0$ (non-negativity constraint). MLE solution is not very attractive, so I decided to use MAP estimate. To do so, we can use Bayes' rule as follows: $P(\theta_a, \theta_b|y) \propto P(y|\theta_a, \theta_b)P(\theta_a)P(\theta_b)$ Here, I am assuming $P(\theta_a, \theta_b) = P(\theta_a)P(\theta_b)$ , independence between the variables. Assuming we have a specific prior distribution for $\theta_a$ (not important for this question), but we want to use a uninformative uniform prior on $\theta_b$ , such that $p(\theta_b) \propto 1$ . Then the posterior reduces to $P(\theta_a, \theta_b|y) \propto P(y|\theta_a, \theta_b)P(\theta_a)$ Then the MAP solution can be obtained by solving the following optimization problem. $\hat{\theta}_a, \hat{\theta}_b = argmax_{\theta_a, \theta_b} L(\theta_a, \theta_b|y) + L(\theta_a)$ subject to $\theta_b \geq 0$ Where $L(\theta_a, \theta_b|y), L(\theta_a)$ are log-likelihoods. Now, I want to solve the above constrained optimization problem with an unconstrained optimization algorithm. So, I can change the variable, such that $\theta_b = e^{\theta'_b}$ . with this change of variable, we solve a different unconstrained optimization problem, $\hat{\theta}_a, \hat{\theta}'_b = argmax_{\theta_a, \theta'_b} L(\theta_a, e^{\theta'_b}|y) + L(\theta_a)$ The optimum $\hat{\theta}_b$ can be recovered by $\hat{\theta}_b = e^{\hat{\theta}_b'}$ The question is, don't we have to change the variable for the $p(\theta_b)$ ? Change of variable theorem will yield a different prior for $\theta'_b$ , like $p_{\theta'_b}(\theta'_b) = p_{\theta_b}(e^{\theta'_b})\lvert \frac{d\theta_b}{d\theta'_b} \rvert \propto e^{\theta'_b}$ ? Then adding the log-likelihood to the above unconstrained optimization problem will yield a different solution.

I have a smooth manifold $M$ (actually, in my case $M$ is just $\mathbb{R}^n$ so it is trivially a manifold). At each point in $M$ , I want to be able to associate a function $f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ such that I have a ""function field"" on the manifold. If I were dealing with finite dimensional vectors as opposed to functions, I could do this by defining, for example, the tangent bundle $TM$ and vector fields would be a smooth section of the bundle. To provide more context, I have also have a functional $L(v)[\cdot]$ indexed by $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ , and I want to choose the specific $f$ at each point that will maximize this functional. This seems to me to be defining a section of a ""function bundle"" of sorts, which would be useful to me as I am hoping to be able to compute information about the $f$ at nearby points given the $f$ associated with one point, i.e. to ""move along the section"" in a well defined way. I apologize if this is too vague of a question. I have spent some time searching and have not encounter a construct quite like this. I am aware that you can have Banach bundles in which each fiber is infinite dimensional, but the examples of that I have seen are such that both the base space and the fibers are infinite dimensional Banach spaces. In my case the base space is finite dimensional. I would appreciate even just a pointer in the right direction, i.e. some sources or keywords to follow up on.

4620663,How many strict local minima a quartic polynomial in two variables might have?,"What is the maximum number $N$ of strict local minima that a degree 4 polynomial $p:\Bbb R^2\to \Bbb R$ can have? One dimension: For a single variable quartic polynomial $q:\Bbb R \to \Bbb R$ the answer to this question would be easy: The polynomial has at most two local minima. Indeed, the derivative $q'$ is a cubic polynomial, so by Fundamental Theorem of Analysis $q$ has at most 3 critical points. However, when $q$ has 3 critical points, then all of them are simple roots, and so two consecutive critical points of $q$ can not be both local minima (local minima/maxima are alternating). Along the lines: My first thought was to study $p$ along the lines $(x,y)=(a+bt,c+dt)$ as one would do to prove that a quadratic polynomial $p:\Bbb R^2\to \Bbb R$ has no more than one strict local minimum. However, this argument fails in the attempt to show that a quartic polynomial $p$ has at most two strict local minima. The problem is that unlike two points, three points in $\Bbb R^2$ can not in general be interpolated by a line. Three points in $\Bbb R^2$ can be interpolated by a quadratic curve like $(x(t),y(t))=(t,at^2+bt+c)$ , but then $t\mapsto p(x(t),y(t))$ could be a polynomial of degree $8$ . At lest 4: Since the polynomial $q(t)=(t^2-1)^2$ has minima at the two points $t=\pm 1$ , the polynomial $p(x,y) = q(x) + q(y)$ has minima at the four points points $(x,y)=(\pm 1,\pm 1)$ . Thus $N\geq 4$ . At most 9: As commented by @GerryMyerson, the partial derivatives $p_x,p_y$ of $p$ are cubic polynomials, and so by Bézout's Theorem the curves $p_x(x,y)=0$ and $p_y(x,y)=0$ intersect at no more than $3\times 3$ isolated points. Hence, $p$ has no more than 9 critical points. The question then is how many critical points $p$ needs to have in order to have $N$ strict local minima: For the case of $N=2$ and a general function $f$ this was answered in the post: If a two variable smooth function has two global minima, will it necessarily have a third critical point? I asked the related question for a degree 4 polynomial and $N\geq 2:$ Is there a quartic polynomial in two variables that have multiple local minima and no other critical points? If you could not determine the exact value of $N$ , could you at least give some lower or upper bound, like that $N>4$ or that $N$ is finite?","['roots', 'real-analysis', 'maxima-minima', 'multivariable-calculus', 'polynomials']"
