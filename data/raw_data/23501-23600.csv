204517,Straight line through data by eye - least squares? [closed],"Closed. This question is off-topic . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it's on-topic for Mathematics Stack Exchange. Closed 11 years ago . Improve this question I heard an interesting fact a while ago about how people draw a line through a cloud of points on a scatter plot. Usually, when calculating lines of best fit, we use the minimal the sum of squares of residuals. But if you draw it (to the best of your ability) by eye, you likely won't draw a squared error fit. I believe the exponent is slightly lower than two. This means we try to draw the line close to many points, and don't worry about a few extreme outliers. Does anyone know what sort of error term we use intuitively? I realise the true objective function we minimise subconsciously probably has a more complex form, but this is just to get an indication for the form of the error penalties relative to least squares. I'm writing a chapter for my thesis about regression analysis and I want to mention the effect of using different exponents on the error term. I thought would be nice to throw this bit of information in, too! Thanks. Edit 1:
I've just posted this photo for my Facebook friends to do some line of best fit by eye. I have asked them to either send me a picture of the graph with line, or just the extreme y-values of the line. It would be great if we could all have a go!
Link: http://www.freeimagehosting.net/ujx9h Sorry for the annoying hosting site. Suggestions for good hoster welcome. Edit 2: (Following discussion in comments.) For simplicity's sake, I am restricting the investigation to error functions of the form of sum of simple exponents of the residual.","['statistics', 'regression', 'mean-square-error']"
204527,Least squares estimator of mu,"The question is: Assuming that $y_i = \mu + \epsilon_i $,$i = 1,\ldots,n$ with independent and identically distributed errors $\epsilon_i$ such that $E[\epsilon_i] = 0$ and $Var[\epsilon_i] = \sigma^2$, find the least squares estimator of $\mu$. Find its variance. I'm not sure how to go about doing this. I know that the least squares bit means that I minimize the sum of the errors, and so I would have to use the formula: $$\sum_i (y_i - \mu)^2$$ and then differentiate (wrt to $\mu$?) and then let it equal 0. Is that correct? Once I've done this, I would I calculate its $E[\mu]$, because I don't have any definition for $\mu$. Or is $\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_i$? If it is, then isn't the estimator the same?","['statistics', 'regression']"
204528,Evaluating limit $\lim_{x\to\infty}(x^2-\sqrt{x^4 + 7x^2 + 1})$,"The problem is evaluate $$\lim_{x\to\infty}(x^2-\sqrt{x^4 + 7x^2 + 1})$$ I understand all of the calculus involved, but am having trouble figuring out how to get started with the algebra. I have tried factoring and using conjugates, but the only answer I am able to get is $-7$, which is incorrect. Any help would be appreciated. What I have done so far: $$\frac{(x^2-\sqrt{x^4+7x^2+1})(x^2+\sqrt{x^4+7x^2+1})}{ x^2+\sqrt{x^4+7x^2+1}}$$ results in $$\frac{-7x^2-1}{x^2+\sqrt{x^4+7x^2+1}}$$ factor out the $x^4$ under the radical, then divide numerator and denominator by $x^2$ to get $$\frac{-7-1/x^2}{1 + \sqrt{1+7/x^2+1/x^4}}$$ at this point the limit as x approaches infinity would be -7/2 or -3.5.","['calculus', 'limits']"
204542,Symbol for the set of odd naturals?,"Obviously the set of naturals is denoted $\mathbb{N}$, but is there a symbol for the set of odd naturals? Would $2\mathbb{N}+1$ (or $2\mathbb{N}-1$) be a standard notation?","['notation', 'elementary-set-theory']"
204552,Computing the Galois group of polynomials $x^n-a \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$,"I have some problems with this exercise. I don't know if it can be done. Consider the polynomial $ x^n - a \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ . Can I compute the Galois group of this over $\mathbb{Q}$ ? Maybe having a nice basis. The splitting field is given by $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n,\alpha)$ , where $\zeta_n$ is a primitive root of unity, and $\alpha$ is some number such that $\alpha^n = a $ .
First of all, I want a good basis for the splitting field.
In the sense that the minimal polynomials of the adjoined elements are different (in this case the computation of the Galois group is very simple). For example, an easy case it's when $a>0$ , then $a^{\frac{1}{n}} \in \mathbb{R}$ , so clearly the minimal polynomials of $a^{\frac{1}{n}}$ , respectively $\zeta_n$ are distinct, and I'm done. If $n$ is odd, then it's also easy, since one root it's also real, for example $x^3+3,a=-3$ , the real root is $
\root 3 \of { - 3}  =  - \root 3 \of 3 
$ , so I can consider the splitting field as $\mathbb{Q}(-\root 3 \of 3 , \zeta_3 )=\mathbb{Q}(\root 3 \of 3 , \zeta_3 )$ .
The difficult case is when $n$ is even and $a<0$ , for example $x^8+20$ or $x^4+20$ . In some cases, as in the second, there are particular cases since there exist algorithms for the Galois group of quartics, but in general it can be done? Remark. I'm searching a good basis for the splitting field.

Here's what I have, even though I'm not sure if I can use L'Hopital in this case (where $k, \delta$ are approaching $\infty, 0$, respectively.) $\lim (1+\delta)^{ak}= \lim e^{ak\log(1+\delta)}=\lim e^{ak\log(1+\delta)}=\lim e^\frac{a\log(1+\delta)}{\frac{1}{k}}=\lim e^\frac{-ak^2}{1+\delta}=0,$ which I find troubling since the base is always greater than 1.

204647,Solving a formal power series equation,"I want to find a function $f(x,y)$ which can satisfy the following equation, $$\prod _{n=1} ^{\infty} \frac{1+x^n}{(1-x^{n/2}y^{n/2})(1-x^{n/2}y^{-n/2})} = \exp \left[ \sum _{n=1} ^\infty \frac{f(x^n,y^n)}{n(1-x^{2n})}\right]$$ I would like to know how this is solved. In a certain paper where I ran into this, it is claimed that the function is, $$f(x,y) = \sqrt{x}(y + 1/y) + x(1+y^2 + 1/y) + x^{3/2}(y^3+1/y^3) + x^2(y^4+1/y^4) + \sum _{n=5}^\infty x^{n/2}(y^n + 1/y^n - y^{n-4} - 1/y^{n-4})$$ The paper doesn't state any proof or explanation for how this was obtained but perturbatively the above can be checked to be correct! Now I tried to do something obvious but it didn't work! \begin{eqnarray} 
\prod _ {n=1} ^{\infty} \frac{ (1+x^n) }{1+x^n -x^{\frac{n}{2}} \left(y^{\frac{n}{2}}  + y^{-\frac{n}{2}}\right) } = \exp \left[ \sum _ {n=1} ^{\infty}   \frac{ I_{ST}(x^n,y^n) } {n (1-x^{2n}) } \right] \\ 
\Rightarrow \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left\{ \ln (1+x^n) - \ln(1-(\sqrt{xy})^n) - \ln\left(1- \left(\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}}\right)^n\right) \right\}  = \sum_{n=1}^\infty  \frac{I_{ST}(x^n,y^n)} {n(1-x^{2n})} 
\end{eqnarray} Now we expand the logarithms and we have, \begin{eqnarray} 
\sum _ {n=1} ^ {\infty} \left \{  \sum _{a=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{a+1} \frac{x^{na}}{a} + \sum_{b=1} ^{\infty} \frac{ (\sqrt{xy})^{nb} } {b} + \sum _{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{ \left(\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}}\right)^{nc} }{c}   \right \} =  \sum _{n=1} ^\infty  \frac{I_{ST}(x^n,y^n)} {n(1-x^{2n})} \\
\Rightarrow \sum _{a=1} ^{\infty} \frac{1}{a} \left\{  \sum _{n=1} ^{\infty} \left( (-1)^{a+1}x^{na} + (xy)^{\frac{na}{2}} + \left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^{\frac{na}{2}} \right)  \right\} =  \sum _{n=1} ^\infty  \frac{I_{ST}(x^n,y^n)} {n(1-x^{2n})}
\end{eqnarray} By matching the patterns on both sides one sees that one way this equality can hold is if, 
$$
\begin{eqnarray} 
I_{ST}(x,y) = (1-x^2) \sum _{n=1} ^{\infty} \left\{ x^n + (xy)^{\frac{n}{2}} + (\frac{x}{y})^{\frac{n}{2}}  \right\} \\
\Rightarrow I_{ST} (x,y) = (1-x^2) \left(-1 + \frac{1}{1-x} -1 + \frac{1}{1-\sqrt{xy}} - 1 + \frac{1}{1-\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}} } \right)

204668,Nagura's paper--can we substitute for the original upper bound?,"This question concerns two results about primes. The first is J. Nagura's 1952 result, that there is a prime on the interval $[x, (1+1/5)x] $ for $x> 2103,$ which depends on the result derived there: $\psi(x) < 1.086x,$ (Lemma 2, p. 179), here. , and the second is  Rosser's 1962 result: $\psi(x) < 1.03883x,$ (Theorem 12, p. 71), here. My question is  whether we can simply insert Rosser's improvement for the upper bound in the last expression in Nagura's paper, an expression which is derived on the last page independent of previous results, to obtain a slightly better bound? If we do this, the expression Nagura uses to establish a lower bound for $\vartheta(\frac{n+1}{n}x)-\vartheta(x)$ on the last page of his paper becomes positive around x = 3225 for n = 7. So we have the slight improvement, that there is always a prime on $(x, (1 + 1/7) x.)$ Maybe this is somewhat obvious. Or wrong. I do see that by 1962 there was no mathematical importance in a marginal improvement over Nagura's result, I am just trying to sort out how some of these older results relate to each other. The question concerns the last equation in Nagura on page 181 before the results, in the middle of the page: $$\vartheta(\frac{n+1}{n}x) - \vartheta(x) \geq 0.916(\frac{n+1}{n}x +\sqrt{x}+ \sqrt[3]{x})- 6.954 - 1.086(x + \sqrt{\frac{x(n+1)}{n}}+    \sqrt[3]{\frac{x(n+1)}{n}}+\sqrt[5]{\frac{x(n+1)}{n}}).$$ [The constant 6.954 is associated with the lower bound 0.916. ] Thanks for any insight.","['special-functions', 'math-history', 'elementary-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

I checked a couple of online equation solvers; also they only mention $-94.9$ .

I (probably) don't understand the following argument made by Toshitsune Miyake in ""Modular Forms"", in the proof of Theorem 4.1.3, page 98. Since $\mathbb{\Gamma}$ contains $\tau = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1\end{smallmatrix}\right]$, and $\omega = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0\end{smallmatrix}\right]$, the boundary points of $\mathcal{F}$, other than $i$, [$\zeta_6 = e^{2\pi i/6}$, $\zeta_6^2$], are [...] ordinary points. This is what I thought: Let $p$ be an elliptic point on the boundary of $\mathcal{F}$, stabilized by $\gamma \in \mathbb{\Gamma}$.
Suppose $p$ isn't $\zeta_6$ nor $\zeta_6^2$. Since $\gamma \mathcal{F} \cap \mathcal{F} \neq \emptyset$, $\gamma$ must now be either $\tau$, $\tau^{-1}$ or $\omega$, but it can't be $\tau$ nor its inverse, for it has to be elliptic.
So the only other possible elliptic points have to be stabilized by $\omega$, which leaves one with $i$. But now I don't know how to prove the step $\gamma \mathcal{F} \cap \mathcal{F} \neq \emptyset\; \Rightarrow\; \gamma = \tau, \tau^{-1}, \omega$, which only is visually clear to me.

204911,An application of Artin Wedderburn and Schur's Lemma,"In an operator algebras class, the professor said the following. Let $G$ be a finite group, and consider the complex group algebra it generates.  Using the following 3 facts, we're supposed to see that $\mathbb{C}[G]$ is algebra-isomorphic to a direct sum of matrix algebras, each the image of some irreducible representation of $\mathbb{C}[G]$  I'm guessing by representation, he means an algebra homomorphism into the linear transforms on some vector space.  By irreducible he probably means there are no invariant subspaces for the representation other than $0$ and the whole vector space. 3 facts are:
1. Artin Wedderburn
2. Schur's Lemma
3. Every division ring over $\mathbb{C}$ is trivial. (I assume what he means is every division algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ is algebra-isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$.) I am incredibly rusty at algebra, being an analyst.  I have a number of questions.  The first is if this kind of situation happens a lot in operator algebras.  I was told when getting into operator algebras that the ""algebra"" part of the name of the field was illusory, and hence would not have to worry that my natural intuition and talents are in analysis, and not at all in algebra.  Is it advisable to master the graduate level type of algebra?  I have had no problem doing the algebra that has come up thus far.  On the other hand, I've heard a professor of mine talking about how group algebras are an important tie-in to the field of operator algebras, so I wonder if the fact that I've forgotten nearly everything might merit a full review of the first year graduate type material in algebra. Another question is if Artin Wedderburn really works for algebras.  I know it's a statement for left/right semisimple rings (with unit), so one could hope that it would work for algebras with semisimple ring structure.  Assuming it does I'm perplexed by the fact that matrix algebras are finite dimensional, so we could deduce that all simple algebras are finite dimensional.  Or is this not the case because Artin Wedderburn only tells you that simple algebras are isomorphic to a matrix algebra over some division algebra over $\mathbb{C}$?  In that case, how can I know that the matrix entries in this case are actually just complex? Thirdly, how would I put together these 3 facts to see the claim? Fourthly, why is every division algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ just a copy of $\mathbb{C}$?","['operator-algebras', 'abstract-algebra']"

If we assume that the velocity of the bullet and space ship are constant, the problem is very simple, there are tons of pages out there on how to lead a target, and I have implemented that target-leading algorithm in my game, but the bullet moves slow enough that by the time it reaches where the enemy space ship would have been, both the bullet and spaceships' velocity have changed due to gravity. My first idea was that the ship and bullet would be moving in an ellipse. I decided to look up the parametric equation for an ellipse, setting the X and Y functions equal to themselves, where the left side has the constants for the bullet's ellipse, and the right side has constants for the enemy's ellipse, and solving each equation for T, but I got lost there, and that won't cover parabolas and hyperbolas if the bullet or enemy reaches escape velocity. So, my question: Assuming the planet is centered at the origin and doesn't move, given my spaceship's position/velocity, the enemy spaceship's position/velocity, the mass of the bullet, and the speed that the bullet will be launched from my ship (not including the velocity of the ship itself), how do I calculate a normalized vector representing the direction my ship should fire so that it hits the enemy? It's ok if there are certain situations where it's impossible to hit the enemy - in those situations my ship can either not fire, or revert to the ""constant velocity"" formula. I'm sure there will be multiple (potentially infinite) solutions, i'm interested in the solution that will occur soonest. It's ok to ignore the possibility that the bullet hits the planet when computing which direction to fire in - once the direction is computed, i just need a way to check if the bullet's trajectory hits the planet before it hits the enemy. If it does, my ship just won't fire.

205736,Fundamental vector fields,I have a question related to fundamental vector fields. For that I first setup the notations and properties etc. Let $G$ be a lie group acting smoothly on the manifold $M$. Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be its lie algebra and let $\xi\in\mathfrak{g}$. Then the fundamental vector field generated by $\xi$ which I denote as $\#(\xi)$ is given by $$\#(\xi)_p = \left.\frac{d}{dt}p\exp(-t\xi)\right|_{t=0}.$$ Now define the map $\phi_p : G \to M$ as $\phi_p(g) = g\cdot p$. Then this is a smooth map (if I am not mistaken about the definition of a smooth action). Now I assume that $p$ is free (i.e it is moved by all elements) so that $\phi_p$ is invertible because it is 1-1. I now prove that its differential is injective. Let $\gamma(t)$ be any curve in $G$ then $$\#(\xi)_p = (\phi_{p})_{*} \left(\left.\frac{d}{dt}(\gamma(t))\right|_{t=0}\right) = \left.\frac{d}{dt}\phi_p(\gamma(t))\right|_{t=0}.$$ But since $p$ is free (i.e fundamental vector field generated by every element is non-zero in some nbd) $\phi_p(\gamma(t))$ is a smooth curve with non-zero tangent. Therefore $(\phi_{p})_{*}$ has zero kernel at this point. Then does this mean that dimension of the lie algebra and hence the lie group should be smaller than or equal to the dimension of the manifold? Note: This particulary holds if the critical points of the action with respect to each $\xi$ is isolated. Let ${e_{\alpha_j}}$ be a basis Indeed let $p$ be a point where $\#(e_{\alpha_1})_p =0$ Then we can find a nbd s.t $\#(e_{\alpha_1})$ is never zero except at $p$. Take such a point and continue on by shrinking the nbd until you find a nbd on which non of  $\#(e_{\alpha_j})$ is zero. Thanks,"['lie-algebras', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"
