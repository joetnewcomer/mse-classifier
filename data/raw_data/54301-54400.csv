579894,"Ruin time for a two-input ""risk only"" slot machine","Imagine a ""risk only"" slot machine that takes 'coins' corresponding to some real number fraction of a dollar $p$, returns the coin with probability $p$, and eats the coin with probability $(1-p)$.  For example, a dime would be eaten with a probability of 90%, a nickel with probability 95%, and so forth. So let's keep feeding the machine two kinds of coins, $A$ and $B$, with fractional dollar values of $p_A$ and $p_B$, respectively.  I have $n_A$ coins of type $A$ and $n_B$ coins of type $B$.  Each time I use the slot machine, I randomly select a coin, ignoring its type, and place it in the machine.  I stop feeding coins into the machine when I run out of either type. CLARIFICATION - By ""randomly select a coin"" I mean that we select a coin from the population of all coins uniformly and randomly.  For instance, if we have $100$ dimes and $567$ nickels, we'd draw a dime with probability $\frac{100}{667}$. At this stopping point, what is the probability of ending with only coins of type A or only coins of Type B?  Provided we end with coins of one type / denomination, what probability distribution and expectation do we have for the number of remaining coins of this type / denomination? I'd also be curious on the number of coins of either type we needed to feed to the machine to reach this end-state?  E.g. how many times did we feed the machine a dime, and how many times did we feed the machine a nickel before stopping? ** If it helps, I can provide some simulation data.  For example, starting with $100$ dimes and $100$ nickels: $n_A = 100$ $n_B = 100$ $p_A = 0.10$ $p_B = 0.05$ We achieve the following results for $10^4$ trials: The mean number of times we place a dime in the machine $= 109.721$ 
(Median $ = 110$) The mean number of times we place a nickel in the machine $= 104.42$
(Median $ = 104$) The number of times we end with only dimes: $5669$ The number of times we end with only nickels: $4331$ The average number of dimes at the end state (conditioned on running out of nickels first): $2.18328$ 
(Median $= 2$) The average number of nickels at the end state (conditioned on running out of dimes first): $1.80513$ 
(Median $= 1$) ** Let's do another simulation starting with $82$ copies of hypothetical 75 cent coins and $432$ copies of 5 cent nickels, and again perform $10^4$ trials: $n_A = 82$ $n_B = 432$ $p_A = 0.75$ $p_B = 0.05$ We achieve the following results for $10^4$ trials: The mean number of times we place a 75 cent coin in the machine $= 268.213$ 
(Median $ = 267$) The mean number of times we place a 5 cent nickel in the machine $= 454.734$

579929,Question on (Brouwer) degree of smooth functions,"Given smooth maps $f:M\to N$ and $g:N\to W$ (between closed, compact, oriented, $n$-manifolds), I want to show that $\text{deg}(g\circ f)=\text{deg}(g)\text{deg}(f)$ (Brouwer degree). I know, given, a regular point $x\in M$, that $sign\ d(g\circ f)_x= (sign\ dg_{f(x)})(sign\ df_x)$, but I'm not sure how I can extend that fact, or if that is even the right direction. The Brouwer degree is defined as follows (Milnor): Let $f:M\to N$ be a smooth map (between closed, compact, oriented n-manifolds) and $p\in M$ a regular point of $f$ such that $df_x:T_xM\to T_{f(x)}N$ is a linear isomorphism. Define $sign\ df_x$ to be $\pm 1$, depending on whether $df_x$ preserves or reverses orientation. Then, for any regular value $q\in N$ 
$\text{deg}(f,q)=\sum_{p\in f^{-1}(q)} sign\ df_x$. Since, in fact, $\text{deg}(f,q)=\text{deg}(f,r)$ for any two regular values $q,r\in N$, $\text{deg}(f,q)$ is just called the (Brouwer) degree of $f$.","['smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

Integrating numerically, it seems like it tends asymptotically to $\lim_{\ell\rightarrow\infty} S_{\ell}(r) = s(r)\, \ell^{-1} \ln \ell$ for $\ell\rightarrow \infty$. What is $s(r)$? This integral gives the interaction energy for vector resonant relaxation between two stellar orbits in astrophysical dynamics. EDIT A possibly useful identity
$$\tag{1} \int_{\phi}^{\pi}(1 + r \cos \psi )^{\ell} d \psi = \sum_{m=0}^{\ell} \frac{2\, i^m \ell!}{(\ell+m)!} \frac{P_{\ell}^{m}(q)}{q^{\ell+1}} {\rm if}\left(m=0, \frac{\pi - \phi}{2},-\frac{\sin (m\phi)}{m}\right)$$
where $q=1/\sqrt{1-r^2}$ and $P_\ell^m(x)$ are associated Legendre polynomials . Furthermore 
$$I_{m\ell}=\int_0^{\pi}\frac{\sin(m \phi)}{(1+r \cos \phi)^{\ell}} d \phi$$ can be integrated analytically as shown (more or less) here . 
However the problem with (1) is that the $m=0$ term grows very quickly with $\ell$ which is cancelled out almost exactly by the $m>1$ terms. For $\ell=20$ and $r=0.8$ the $m=0$ term is $3.4604541\times 10^{15}$, while the sum of the $m>1$ terms is $-3.4604541\times10^{15}$. The two terms have the same magnitude to 15 significant digits, such that their sum is 0.411. This shows that these terms require an extremely accurate numerical calculation. If someone can (i) figure out the underlying reason for this magical cancellation or (ii) give an analytical solution for the $m=0$ term, then the large numbers may be removed and make this calculable. I was hoping that someone can write down a clever solution altogether circumventing the use of (1).

580141,"For any real numbers $a,b,c$ show that $\displaystyle \min\{(a-b)^2,(b-c)^2,(c-a)^2\} \leq \frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{2}$","For any real numbers $a,b,c$ show that:
 $$ \min\{(a-b)^2,(b-c)^2,(c-a)^2\} \leq \frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{2}$$ OK. So, here is my attempt to solve the problem: We can assume, Without Loss Of Generality, that $a \leq b \leq c$ because of the symmetry. $a \leq b \leq c$ implies that $0 \leq b-a \leq c-a$. Since both sides are positive and $y=x^2$ is an increasing function for positive numbers we conclude that $(b-a)^2 \leq (c-a)^2$ and since $(a-b)^2=(b-a)^2$ we obtain $(a-b)^2 \leq (c-a)^2$. Therefore: $\min\{(a-b)^2,(b-c)^2,(c-a)^2\}=$ $$\min\{(b-c)^2,\min\{(a-b)^2,(c-a)^2\}\}=
\min\{(a-b)^2,(b-c)^2\}.$$ So, we have to prove the following inequality instead: $$\min\{(a-b)^2,(b-c)^2\} \leq \frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{2}$$ Now two cases can happen: $$(a-b)^2 \leq (b-c)^2 \implies |a-b| \leq |b-c|=c-b \implies b-c \leq a-b \leq c-b \implies 2b-c \leq a \implies b \leq \frac{a+c}{2}.$$ $$(b-c)^2 \leq (a-b)^2 \implies |c-b| \leq |a-b|=b-a \implies a-b \leq c-b \leq b-a \implies c \leq 2b-a \implies b \geq \frac{a+c}{2}.$$ So, this all boils down to whether $b$ is greater than the arithmetic mean of $a$ and $b$ are not. Now I'm stuck. If $a,b,c$ had been assumed to be positive real numbers it would've been a lot easier to go forward from this step. But since we have made no assumptions on the signs of $a,b$ and $c$ I have no idea what I should do next. Maybe I shouldn't care about what $\displaystyle \min\{(a-b)^2,(b-c)^2\}$ is equal to and I should continue my argument by dealing with $(a-b)^2$ and $(b-c)^2$ instead. I doubt that using the formula $\displaystyle \min\{x,y\}=\frac{x+y - |x-y|}{2}$ would simplify this any further. Any ideas on how to go further are appreciated.","['inequality', 'algebra-precalculus', 'contest-math']"

Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a coherent sheaf on $X$. Then: (1) for each $i \geq 0$, $H^u(X, \mathscr{F})$ is a finitely-generated $A$-module; [...] The proof proceeds by reducing to the case $X = \mathbb{P}^r_A$ and then checking things for $\mathcal{O}_X(q)$, which is fine.  Then we need to establish things for arbitrary coherent sheaves.  The proof here reads: [...] In general, given a coherent sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ on $X$, we can write $\mathscr{F}$ as a quotient of a sheaf $\mathscr{E}$, which is a finite direct sum of sheaves $\mathcal{O}(q_i)$ for various integers $q_i$.  Let $\mathscr{R}$ be the kernel,
  $$0 \to \mathscr{R} \to \mathscr{E} \to \mathscr{F} \to 0,$$
  Then $\mathscr{R}$ is also coherent.  We get an exact sequence of $A$-modules
  $$\cdots \to H^i(X, \mathscr{E}) \to H^i(X, \mathscr{F}) \to H^{i+1}(X, \mathscr{R}) \to \cdots$$
  Now the module on the left is finitely generated because $\mathscr{E}$ is a sum of $\mathcal{O}(q_i)$, as remarked above.  The module on the right is finitely generated by the induction hypothesis. [...] This last sentence I don't understand.  It doesn't explicitly state what the inductive hypothesis is, but I assume that it's that $H^j(X, \mathscr{F})$ is a finitely-generated $A$-module for $j > i$.  In this case, what we know is that we have an exact sequence
$$\cdots \to H^i(X, \mathscr{F}) \to H^{i+1}(X, \mathscr{R}) \to H^{i+1}(X, \mathscr{E}) \to H^{i+1}(X, \mathscr{F}) \to \cdots$$
where the two rightmost terms are finitely generated as $A$-modules.  Since we don't seem to know anything about $H^i(X, \mathscr{F})$ on the left side yet, I don't see how this helps us establish anything about $H^{i+1}(X, \mathscr{R})$. What have I missed?",['algebraic-geometry']

580277,Minimal subbases for the canonical topology on $\mathbb{R}$?,"Thoughts: I know that every base for the canonical topology can be reduced. So I'm guessing that maybe the canonical topology doesn't have a minimal subbase? Would it be possible to use the fact that every base for the canonical topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is not minimal? Or can we directly deal with subbases? If we take the canonical topology on $\mathbb{R}$ then a subbase for the canonical topology would be the collection of sets $(-\infty,b)$ and $(a,\infty)$ where $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$. Call this collection $\Delta$. It is then easy to see that we can always take an element out because if we take out $(-\infty,x)$ for some $x\in\mathbb{R}$, then every $(a,x)$ for any $a\in\mathbb{R}$ is still a union of elements in the collection of all finite intersections of $\Delta\backslash\{(-\infty,x)\}$ .

580494,Maximizing a sum of inner products,"Someone asked this question on a French maths forum here and it caught my attention.

Find the minimum and maximum possible values of the sum $$\langle u_1, u_2 \rangle + \langle u_2, u_3 \rangle + \dots + \langle u_{n-1}, u_n \rangle + \langle u_n, u_1 \rangle$$
when the $u_k$ are unit vectors whose sum is zero. $$ $$
$$ $$ Edit : Okay, since there is no answer so far, let me write here what I came up with, maybe someone will know how to follow. Of course, there could be a much better approach! Let's introduce a couple of notations. Let $E^n$ denote the $n$-fold space with its inner product derived from $E$ (*) and let $\varphi$ and $\psi$ denote the functions defined by:
$$ \varphi: \left\{
\begin{array}{ccc}
E^n & \rightarrow &\mathbb{R} \\
u = (u_1, \dots, u_n) &\mapsto & \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle + \dots + \langle u_n, u_1 \rangle
\end{array} \right.$$
$$ \psi: \left\{
\begin{array}{ccc}
E^n & \rightarrow &\mathbb{R}^n \times E \\
u = (u_1, \dots, u_n) &\mapsto & \left((||u_i||^2 - 1)_{k= 1 \dots n}\,,\, \sum_{k=1}^n u_k\right)\\
\end{array} \right.$$ So the question is: find the extrema of $\varphi$ on the level set $K := \{\psi = 0\}$. Note that $K$ is compact (NB: it looks like a ""slice"" of an $n$-fold product of hyperspheres, whatever) so $\varphi$ has a minimum and a maximum on $K$ indeed. What are their values? Let's see what differential calculus tells us (**). Let $u = (u_1, \dots, u_n)$ be a local extremum of $\varphi_{|K}$. The derivative of $\varphi$ at $u$ must kill tangent vectors to $K$, which amounts to say that $\mathrm{Ker}\, D_u \psi \subset \mathrm{Ker}\, D_u \varphi$. It is straightforward to compute these derivatives and their kernels, they are given by:
$$ \mathrm{Ker}\, D_u \varphi = \{v\}^\perp$$
where $v = (u_n + u_2, u_1 + u_3, \dots, u_{n-1} + u_1) \in E^n$, and 
$$ \mathrm{Ker}\, D_u \psi = ({L_1}^\perp \times \dots \times {L_n}^\perp) ~ \cap ~ \Delta^\perp$$
where $L_k$ denotes the line through $u_k$ in $E$ and $\Delta$ denotes the diagonal in $E^n$. The condition $\mathrm{Ker}\, D_u \psi \subset \mathrm{Ker}\, D_u \varphi$ then amounts to saying that $v \in ({L_1}\times \dots \times {L_n}) ~ + ~ \Delta$. In conclusion: if $u = (u_1, \dots, u_n)$ is a local extremum of $\varphi$ restricted to $K$, then there exists scalars $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n$ and a vector $a \in E$ such that:
$$\begin{align*}
u_n + u_2 &= \lambda_1 u_1 + a \\
u_1 + u_3 &= \lambda_2 u_2 + a \\
& \cdots  \\
u_{n-1} + u_1 & =  \lambda_n u_n + a 
\end{align*}$$ What can we derive from that? First, note that $a$ is given by 
$0 = \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k u_k + na$ (sum all the equations). Also, the value of $\varphi$ at this point $u$ is given by $\sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k / 2$. More importantly, it is easy to see inductively that all the $u_k$ lie in a same
$3$-dimensional subspace of $E$. That's all that I could derive from these equations unfortunately. But I think it should be possible to make them confess more, maybe using a symmetry argument. Here is what I suspect: $a$ must be $0$ and all the $\lambda_k$ must be equal. It follows that all the $u_k$ are coplanar and that the angle between $u_k$ and $u_{k+2}$ is constant. Finally, in a nutshell, break into cases according to whether $n$ is even or odd. In both cases, the maximum is achieved when the $u_k$ lie like $n$-th roots of unity on the circle, and it is given by $n \cos (2\pi / n)$. When $n$ is even, the minimum is $-n$ (just take $u_1 = u_3 = \dots = u_{n-1} = -u_2 = -u_4 = \dots = -u_n$) and when $n$ is odd, $-n \cos(2\pi/n)$ (not totally sure about that last one). Wow, this is much longer than I expected, hope I didn't bore too many people to death. $$ $$

\tag{1}
\end{align*} is called the Ahmed's integral and became famous since its first discovery in 2002. Fascinated by this unbelievable closed form, I have been trying to generalize this result for many years, though not successful so far. But suddenly it came to me that some degree of generalization may be possible. My conjecture is as follows: Define the (generalized) Ahmed integral of parameter $p$, $q$ and $r$ by \begin{align*}
A(p, q, r) := \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\arctan q \sqrt{p^{2}x^{2} + 1}}{q \sqrt{p^{2}x^{2} + 1} } \, \frac{pqr \, dx}{(r^{2} + 1)p^{2} x^{2} + 1}.
\end{align*} Now suppose that $p q r = 1$, and define its complementary parameters as \begin{align*}
\tilde{p} = r \sqrt{\smash{q}^{2} + 1}, \quad
\tilde{q} = p \sqrt{\smash{r}^{2} + 1}, \quad \text{and} \quad
\tilde{r} = q \sqrt{\smash{p}^{2} + 1},
\tag{2}
\end{align*} Then my guess is that \begin{align*}
A(p, q, r) = \frac{\pi^{2}}{8} + \frac{1}{2} \left\{ \arctan^{2} (1 / \tilde{p} ) - \arctan^{2} ( \tilde{q} ) - \arctan^{2} ( \tilde{r} ) \right\}.
\end{align*} Plugging the values $(p, q, r) = (1/\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}, 1)$, the corresponding complementary parameters become $(\tilde{p}, \tilde{q}, \tilde{r}) = (\sqrt{3}, 1, \sqrt{3})$. Then for these choices, the original Ahmed's integral $\text{(1)}$ is retrieved: \begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\arctan \sqrt{x^{2} + 2} }{\sqrt{x^{2} + 2} } \, \frac{dx}{x^{2} + 1} 
&= \frac{\pi^{2}}{8} + \frac{1}{2} \left\{ \arctan^{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - \arctan^{2} 1 - \arctan^{2} \sqrt{3} \right\} \\
&= \frac{5\pi^{2}}{96}.
\end{align*} In fact, I have a more generalized conjecture involving dilogarithms depending on complementary parameters. But since this specialized version is sufficiently daunting, I won't deal with it here. Unfortunately, proving this relation is not successful so far. I just heuristically calculated and made some ansatz to reach this form. Can you help me improve the situation by proving this or providing references to some known results? EDIT. I finally succeeded in proving a general formula: let $k = pqr$ and complementary parameters as in $\text{(2)}$. Then whenever $k \leq 1$, we have \begin{align*}
A(p, q, r) 
&= 2\chi_{2}(k) - k \arctan (\tilde{p}) \arctan \left( \frac{k}{\tilde{p}} \right) \\
&\quad + \frac{k}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{1-k^{2}x^{2}} \log\left( \frac{1+\tilde{p}^{2}x^{2}}{1+\tilde{p}^{2}} \times \frac{1+\tilde{q}^{2}x^{2}}{1+\tilde{q}^{2}} \times \frac{1+\tilde{r}^{2}x^{2}}{1+\tilde{r}^{2}} \right) \, dx.
\end{align*} Then the proposed conjecture follows as a corollary. I'm planning to gather materials related to the Ahmed's integrals and put into a combined one. You can find an ongoing proof of this formula here .","['definite-integrals', 'special-functions', 'integration']"

Why is my reasoning wrong (my reasoning sounds like it's related to functional calculus, instead of standard calculus)?

But the same way you write $f(y)=y^2$, you could write $f(y)=\frac{d}{dx}y$, which clearly depends on $y'$.

By the Mittag-Leffler theorem, there exists a meromorphic function $f_2$ with only simple poles precisely at each $z_n$ and with residues $w_n /f_1'(z_n)$. If $f = f_1 \cdot f_2$, then $f$ has removable singularities at each $z_n$ with values $w_n$ since

581278,conjecture regarding the cosine fixed point,"context/motivation if the angle on a calculator is set to radians, then it is very easy to demonstrate that iteration of $cos x$ (for arbitrary initial x) converges - simply keep pressing the $cos$ button! this unique fixed point $\alpha$ might reasonably be expected to be a transcendental number. (perhaps the answer to that is already known?). the conjecture outlined here suggests that $\alpha$ is an upper bound for a whole family of numbers defined in terms of iteration of particular sequences of cosine and sine functions. since these mixed iterations give rise to limit cycles rather than fixed points, we use the Cesaro mean to give a characteristic number for each cycle. the cycles i initially considered are easily defined in terms of the periodic binary representation of fractions whose denominator is not a power of 2. however whilst these are the only numbers corresponding to the sequences of sine and cosine that converge towards stable orbits, it seems likely that the periodicity itself is not the key factor ensuring Cesaro convergence, but that this is achieved due to a weaker asymptotic density condition which is necessary but not sufficient for periodicity. i apologise for any mistakes or lack of clarity in my (necessarily brief) presentation. the basic idea is simpler than may appear from a first glimpse of the definitions. preliminary definitions let $I$ be the closed unit interval $[0,1]$ so that the sine and cosine functions restrict to injective maps of $I$ into itself. for integers $n \gt 0$ define $\beta_n:I \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ to be the $n^{th}$ binary digit of its argument, so $\beta_n(\lambda)=\lfloor 2^n\lambda \rfloor$ now define $\psi:\{0,1\} \times I \rightarrow I $ by:
$$ \psi(0,\theta) = cos \theta \\  \psi(1,\theta) = sin \theta $$ every $\lambda \in I$ can be associated with a function 
$\Psi_{\lambda}:I \rightarrow I^{\omega}$ which generates a sequence in $I$, i.e. $$ \forall \theta \in I, \Psi_{\lambda}(\theta) = \{\theta_n\}_{n=0,1,2,...} $$ with $\theta_0=\theta$ and for $n \ge 0$
$$ \theta_{n+1} = \psi(\beta_{n+1}(\lambda),\theta_n) $$ let us now call $\lambda \in I$ a $\beta$-number if an asymptotic density of $1$s in its binary representation exists, i.e. if the sequence $\{\beta_n(\lambda)\}$ has a Cesaro-mean. this mean, if it exists, we may denote by $\beta^*(\lambda)$ let us also define $\alpha$ as the unique fixed point in I of the cosine function, i.e. $$cos \; \alpha = \alpha$$ conjecture 1. $\forall \theta \in I$ the sequence $\Psi_{\lambda}(\theta)$ has a Cesaro mean if and only if $\lambda$ is a $\beta$-number, and in this case the Cesaro mean is independent of $\theta$ and may be denoted $\Psi_{\lambda}^*$ 2. if the sequence $\Psi_{\lambda}(\theta)$ has Cesaro mean, then this mean is equal to $\alpha$ if and only if $\beta^*(\lambda)=0$ 3. for any $\beta$-number $\lambda$ if $\beta^*(\lambda) \gt 0$ then  $\Psi_{\lambda}^*\lt \alpha$","['trigonometry', 'analysis']"
581326,Show that the function $f = \frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2}$ is continuous along every horizontal and every vertical line,"Consider the function $ f:\mathbb{R^2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ given by $ f(x,y) = \left\{

581338,What are the benefits or losses of learning real analysis through a constructivist approach instead of a standard apporach?,"Recently I've found some courses on real analysis that use the constructivist approach and I got curious on some aspects: What are the benefits of learning through this approach? Is it ok to learn through a constructivist approach instead of a standard approach? How different the teaching on these approaches would be? Here I'm presuming a student who haven't taken real analysis
lectures. I'm presuming that constructivist approaches to real analysis are not a standard practice in analysis courses but I'm not sure about that.","['education', 'self-learning', 'real-analysis', 'analysis', 'constructive-mathematics']"
581353,"Smallest normal subgroup making quotient abelian, nilpotent, solvable","Given a finite group $G$ that is not abelian, nilpotent, or solvable, what is the smallest normal subgroup $H$ in each case such that $G/H$ is abelian, nilpotent, or solvable (respectively)? In the abelian case it seems clear that the correct subgroup is the commutator subgroup. But what of the other two? Perhaps I'm just shaky with the concepts (of nilpotency and solvability) but I'm having trouble finding the right way to tackle this problem. Edit: Well I've tried the most obvious thing and it worked out. For the nilpotent case I took the intersection of all the subgroups in the lower central series, and for the solvable case I took the intersection of all subgroups in the derived/commutator series.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'normal-subgroups']"

581365,Different versions of Urysohn's Lemma,"In short, I encountered two different versions of Urysohn Lemma, which I shall present here: Version 1: [Big Rudin, 2.12, page 39]: Suppose X is a locally compact Hausdorff space, V is open in X, $K \subset V$ and K is compact. Then there exists an $f \in C_c(X)$ such that $K \prec f \prec V$ with the following notation: $f \in C_c(X)$ if f is continuous and has compact support $K \prec f$ if $0 \le f(x) \le 1$ for all x and $f(K) = 1$ $f \prec V$ if $0 \le f(x) \le 1$ for all x and the support of f lies in V. Version 2: [Munkres, Topology, page 201]: Let X be a normal space, let A and B be disjoint closed subsets of X. Let [a,b] a closed interval in the real line. Then there exists a continuous map $f: X \rightarrow [a,b]$ such that $f(x) = a \forall x \in A$ and $f(x) = b \forall x \in B$ My question is that which version is ""stronger""? I've tried to deduce whether one version is the consequence of another, but it seems not the case. As far as I read through both books, each version has distinct applications, so how the difference in the initial condition affect their application?","['general-topology', 'functions']"
