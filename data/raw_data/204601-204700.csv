4055795,finding groups $G$ such that $G \simeq \operatorname{Aut}(G)$,"I proved that the mapping $\phi: G \to \operatorname{Aut}(G)$ that sends $g \longmapsto c_g (x) = gxg^{-1}$ is a homomorphism, but I need to find a group $G$ for which this map establishes an isomorphism. I know that $S_3$ is isomorphic to $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ , but I don't know off-hand whether this bijection is the correct one. I referenced a similar answer here Proving that ${\rm Aut}(S_3)$ is isomorphic to $S_3$ , but it doesn't give an explicit formula for the bijection, and though I understand that $S_3$ is generated by its transpositions and so any automorphism is determined completely by how it acts on $(12)$ , $(13)$ , and $(23)$ , I don't understand how a bijection follows. Updated Attempt: I claim that $\phi: S_3 \to \mathrm{Aut}(S_3)$ sending $g \longmapsto c_g (x) = gxg^{-1}$ is an isomorphism. In general, $\phi: G \to \mathrm{Aut}(G)$ sending $g \longmapsto c_g$ is a homomorphism, so it suffices to show that $\phi$ is a bijection. We have: \begin{align*}
g \in \mathrm{ker}(\phi) & \iff \phi(g) = c_g (x) = x, \; \forall x \in G \\
& \iff gxg^{-1} = x, \; \forall x \in G \\
& \iff gx = xg, \; \forall x \in G \\
& \iff g \in Z(G) = \{e\},
\end{align*} so the kernel of $\phi$ is trivial, so $\phi$ is injective. I claim that $\phi$ is also surjective. We have $S_3 = \langle a = (12), b = (13), c = (23) \rangle$ , each of which has order $2$ , so given $g \in S_3$ , we have $g = a^i b^j c^k$ for $i,j,k \in \{0,1,2\}$ . Since an automorphism $f \in Aut(S_3)$ must preserve the order of elements, $f$ must send transpositions to transpositions. Furthermore, upon fixing where $f$ send these transpositions, the rest of the map is determined. Since there are $3!$ possibilities for where to send the permutations, there are exactly $6$ automorphisms, so $|S_3| = |\mathrm{Aut}(S_3)|$ . But $\phi(S_3) \leq \text{Aut}(S_3)$ , so that they have the same order immediately implies that $\phi(S_3) = \text{Aut}(S_3)$ , so $\phi$ is surjective, hence bijective.","['proof-explanation', 'group-theory']"
4055798,Alternating divergent series,"I know that a necessary condition for a series to converge is that the general term $(a_n)$ goes to zero, but is it possible for an alternating divergent series to have a general term that goes to zero? If so, can you give an example.

4055863,Group law of elliptic curve under transformation,"For example, elliptic curve $E:y^2＝x^3-x$ can be transformed
to move the identity element to the origin, $(z,w)=(0,0)$ , we do the change of coordinates $z=-x/y$ , $w=-1/y$ . The equation of this curve then becomes $w=z^3+zw^2\quad$ My question is
; Does E': $w=z^3+zw^2 $ have group structure, just like ' take two points from $E'$ ,and line through those points intersects at $E'$ , and connect the point with $（0,0）∈（z,w）$ , then the line intersects with $E'$ again, and this is the sum of first two points' ? The graph of $w=z^3+zw^2\quad$ seems completely different in affine plane from usual $y^2＝x^3-x$ , so I'm suspicious. But maybe we can say the group structure above holds because they are both same Weierstrass from in projective plane, so is isomorphic to Picard group of $E$ .","['arithmetic-geometry', 'group-theory', 'elliptic-curves']"
4055886,"Calculate $f(0), f(1)$ of a function","Let $f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{5x^n}{3^n(1-2x)}$ and assume this function is defined wherever this series converges. Calculate $f(0)$ , $f(1)$ , and determine whether $f(x) \leq 0$ for all x in the domain. For $f(0)$ this seems to be trivial as it evaluates to $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}0$ , which is just 0. For $f(1)$ , it seems like $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{5}{-3^n}$ , which I would have to calculate what it converges to. I ended up with $f(1)=\frac{-5}{2}$ . Is this correct? For the last question, whether $f(x) \leq 0$ or not, I hypothesize that it is. I used multiple other values such as $f(2)$ , $f(2.5)$ , etc. (Also I didn't use values outside of the domain.)","['calculus', 'functions']"

4055974,Proof check. There is no set containing all abelian groups,"Let $X$ be an infinite set and $Y$ be the set of finite subsets of $X$ . Show that there
is a bijective map from $X$ to $Y$ . Show that $(Y, \Delta)$ is an abelian group (where $\Delta$ is symmetric difference.) Use it to show
that every nonempty set can be given an abelian group structure. Deduce that there
is no set containing all abelian groups. I think I have proved, what was asked in above question, but am not 100% sure, mostly in part 3,4, (though I have added other part in case, i have done something wrong. First part is already known to me as it is available on this site as well) $Y = \{Z \subset X : |Z| < \infty  \}$ . We need to show that $|X| = |Y|$ . I was able to prove this when $X$ is countable. Though I was not able to prove it in general, but was able to get the same result on this site. Since $Y \subset P(X)$ , and $(P(X), \Delta)$ is indeed an Abelian group, so we just need to check the closure property and existence of inverse. Since $B \in Y $ is its own inverse, and for $B, C \in Y$ , $|B \Delta C| \leq |B|+|C|$ so is finite and and hence an element of $Y$ . Hence the claim. Let $X\neq \varnothing$ . Case 1. $X$ is finite. In this case we have say, $X = \{x_{0},x_{1}, \cdots x_{n-1}\}$ . Define $\star:X \times X \to X$ as $x_{i} \star x_{j} = x_{(i+j) \,\text{mod(n)}}$ , where $i \in \{0,1, \cdots n-1 \}$ and, Clearly here, we have $x_{i}\star x_{j} = x_{j} \star x_{i}$ also, $x_0$ is identity element and $x_{n - i}$ is inverse of $x_{i}$ (where $x_n = x_0$ ). Case 2. $X$ is infinite. Let, $f: X \to Y$ be a bijection from $X$ to $Y$ which exists because of part 1. Define $\star: X \times X \to X$ as follows, for $a, b \in X$ , $a \star b = f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(b))$ , which is an element of $X$ , and $f^{-1}$ exists and is bijection, so well defined binary map. Existence of Identity Since $f$ is bijection, so there exists $a_0 \in X$ such that $f(a_0) = \varnothing$ (Since $\varnothing \in Y$ ). This $a_0$ is identity element, since $a \star a_0 = f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(a_0)) = f^{-1}(f(a)\Delta \varnothing) = f^{-1}(f(a)) = a$ . Inverse $a$ is self inverse, since $a \star a = f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(a)) = f^{-1}(\varnothing) = a_0$ . Associativity It follows since $(a \star b) \star c = f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(b)) \star c = f^{-1}(f(f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(b)))\Delta f(c)) = f^{-1}((f(a) \Delta f(b))\Delta f(c)) = f^{-1}(f(a)\Delta (f(b)\Delta f(c))) = a \star f^{-1}(f(b) \Delta f(c)) = a \star (b \star c)$ . Commutativity Finally since $a \star b = f^{-1}(f(a) \Delta f(b)) = f^{-1}(f(b) \Delta f(a)) = b \star a$ , hence $\star$ is commutative. For this I thought since, every set can be given a Abelian structure, so if such a set exists, it will contain all sets. And we know, set of all sets dose not exists, so set of all Abelian group dosent exists.","['elementary-set-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'abelian-groups']"
4055976,Is the derivative of the Riemann integral continuous wherever it exists?,"Let $f$ be Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ and let $F(x)$ be its integral on $[a,x]$ . (Note the minimal assumption of integrability, not continuity.) Must $F’$ be continuous wherever it’s defined? ( Nota bene : here I mean continuous in the general sense of continuous on its domain. On this definition, it’s possible for a function to be continuous at a point without there being a deleted interval of the point on which the function is defined.) Context The claim is plausible on these heuristic grounds: $F$ ignores trouble at discontinuities (which happen on a set of measure zero), so even if $f$ fails to be continuous somewhere, $F’$ should be continuous there (if it exists). In other words, $F’$ should be “at least as nice” as $f$ (again, given that it exists). As an example, take an $f$ continuous except at $c$ , where it has a removable discontinuity. Let $g$ be the everywhere continuous function that removes the discontinuity. Since $f=g$ almost everywhere, their integrals $F$ and $G$ are everywhere the same. By the FTC, $G’=g$ ; combining with the previous sentence we have $F’=g$ . Thus $F’$ will be continuous at $c$ even though $f$ isn’t: it plugs the hole. This is just intuition. Any proof will need to deal with two cases: one at points where $f$ is continuous and the other at points where $f$ is discontinuous. In the former case we know by the FTC that $F’$ exists at $c$ (and moreover $F’(c)=f(c)$ ). Can we prove that it’s continuous there? In the latter case, we could break into subcases depending on the type of discontinuity. If $f$ has a removable discontinuity we can reduce to the previous case. If $f$ has a jump discontinuity, I think we can show $F’$ doesn’t exist. And if $f$ has an essential (oscillatory) discontinuity, I also think we can show $F’$ doesn’t exist. (I haven’t produced a rigorous argument but can’t find counterexamples. I’m stuck with $f(x)=\sin(1/x)$ on $[-1,0)\cup(0,1]$ and $0$ at the origin. Will $F’$ exist at the origin?) If all that’s right, the proof depends essentially on whether the following implication holds: $f$ continuous at $c$ implies $F’$ continuous at $c$ . If we strengthen the hypothesis by assuming $f$ is not just continuous but differentiable at $c$ , it does indeed follow that $F’$ is continuous at $c$ . The question is whether we can relax the hypothesis to bare continuity of $f$ at $c$ . EDIT Paramanand Singh points out in comments that $F'$ can indeed exist and be discontinuous where $f$ has an oscillatory discontinuity. (The right example, as I guessed, was $f(x)=\sin(1/x)$ on $[-1,0)\cup(0,1]$ and $0$ at the origin, but it turns out that $F'$ exists here, contrary to my hunch.) So the answer to the question in the title is no. But this question is still open: if $f$ is continuous somewhere, must $F'$ be continuous there?","['integration', 'calculus', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
4055983,Tree Diagram: What is the probability that a customer purchases the basic or classic car wash if they vacuum their car?,"This equation comes from Edgenuity's course of Statistics, and I am taking the course as a high school senior. I understand that to find $P(A$ | $B)$ , one divides $P(A$ and $B)$ by $P(B)$ . Also, to find $P(A$ or $B)$ , one adds $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ . I attempt to do this in my solving of the problem below: A car wash has three different types of washes: basic, classic, and ultimate. Based on records, 45% of customers get the basic wash, 35%
get the classic wash, and 20% get the ultimate wash. Some customers
also vacuum out their cars after the wash. The car wash records show
that 10% of customers who get the basic wash, 25% of customers who get
the classic wash, and 60% of customers who get the ultimate wash also
vacuum their cars. The probabilities are displayed in the tree
diagram. What is the probability that a randomly selected customer purchases the basic or classic car wash if they vacuum their car? First , I found the total probability of having any type of wash and having the car vacuumed $(0.2525)$ by adding each probability of having whatever type of wash and the probability of vacuuming after using that type of wash (i.e., $(0.45 * 0.10) + (0.35 * 0.25) + (0.2 * 0.6) = 0.2525$ ). Second , I added $P($ Basic and Vacuum $)$ and $P($ Classic and Vacuum $)$ , which is $0.1325$ , because $P(A$ or $B)$ is $P(A)$ $+$ $P(B)$ . Lastly , I divided $0.1325$ by $0.2525$ to find $P($ Basic or Classic | Vacuum $)$ because $P(A$ | $B)$ $=$ $P(A$ and $B)$ $÷$ $P(B)$ . The answer is approximately $0.52$ . Are my methods and answer correct? If not, please explain why.","['statistics', 'probability']"

4056044,Existence condition for rational polynomials,"First of all sorry for the stupid question but my knowledge in mathematics is not big. I am studying by myself how determine the existence condition for a polynomial.
In particular I am not sure to perform correctly the following exercise.

\color{green}{3(2a+b)}\neq 0\\
\color{blue}{6(2a+b)}\neq 0\\
a^3-b^3\neq 0\\

In particular I have imposed, in addition to the first three condition (red, blue and green) referred to the denominator of the fractions in the expression, also that the term $\frac{a^3-b^3}{\color{blue}{6(2a+b)}}$ has to be different from $0$ . I have thought that since it is a factor that the exercise tell us to divide thanks to the symbol "" $:$ "", in addition to the existence condition on this fraction I should be sure that this fraction is not identically $0$ since it represents a denominator for the term $\left(\frac{a^2}{4a^2+4ab+b^2}-\frac{a-b}{6a+3b}\right)$ : so I have to impose also the condition in black, right?

4056045,Paradox: Roots of a polynomial require less information to express than coefficients?,"A somewhat information theoretical paradox occurred to me, and I was wondering if anyone could resolve it. Let $p(x) = x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + c_0 = (x - r_0) \cdots (x - r_{n-1})$ be a degree $n$ polynomial with leading coefficient $1$ . Clearly, the polynomial can be specified exactly by its $n$ coefficients $c=\{c_{n-1}, \ldots, c_0\}$ OR by its $n$ roots $r=\{r_{n-1}, \ldots, r_0\}$ . So the roots and the coefficients contain the same information. However, it takes less information to specify the roots, because their order doesn't matter . (i.e. the roots of the polynomial require $\lg(n!)$ bits less information to specify than the coefficients). Isn't this a paradox? Or is my logic off somewhere? Edit: To clarify, all values belong to any algebraically closed field (such as the complex numbers). And note that the leading coefficient is specified to be 1, meaning that there is absolutely a one-to-one correspondence between the $n$ remaining coefficients $c$ and the $n$ roots $r$ .","['information-theory', 'combinatorics', 'polynomials', 'roots']"

4056177,On leap years and conditional probability,"Edit (Copying this from the end of my post and pasting it at the start because people are still voting to close this.) Before anyone flags this as a duplicate, I understand that the following exact problem has been posted before, but my post is about why my logic (for the second question below) is wrong (and not about what the correct answer should be). Problem A year in the 2020s (i.e. from 2020 to 2029 inclusive) is selected uniformly at random, a month is selected uniformly at random from that year and a day is selected uniformly at random from that month. What is the probability that the day is the 29th of February? Given that the day is the 29th, what is the probability that the month is February? My idea for Question 1 The first question is very clear-cut. First, we observe that only leap years have a ""29th of February"" and out of the entire decade, only 3 are leap years (i.e. 2020, 2024 and 2028), so we have a $\frac 3 {10}$ chance of picking a leap year. By the same logic, we have a $\frac 1 {12}$ chance of picking February out of the leap year we have chosen and we have a further $\frac 1 {29}$ chance of picking the 29th of February from the February of the leap year we have chosen. Thus, $\mathbb{P}(\mathrm{29th\ of\ February}) = (\frac 3 {10})(\frac 1 {12})(\frac 1 {29}) = \frac 1 {1160}$ . Okay. Easy. My idea for Question 2 Now, I understand that the second question is on conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem should be invoked. However, smart me thought I saw a short-cut (obviously incorrectly) and I have been wondering why my logic (as explained below) is wrong. Since we are ""given that the day is the 29th"", I thought that we need only pick a year and a month. In other words, once we have a year and a month set, the probability that the day is the 29th should be $1$ right? Thus, $\mathbb{P}(\mathrm{February\ |\ 29th}) = (\frac 3 {10})(\frac 1 {12}) = \frac 1 {40}$ . Again. Easy. Or so I thought. Suggested solution for Question 2 From the solution given (as explained below), it seems I have oversimplified Question 2. According to my professor, we need to break the question down much more than I had. First, we must observe that, out of the entire decade (i.e. 120 months), we have 3 months with 29 days, 40 months with 30 days (since 4 months in a year have 30 days) and 70 months with 31 days (since 7 months in a year have 31 days). We do not count the ""normal Februarys (i.e. the Februarys with 28 days)"" as it is obvious that we cannot possibly have a 29th day from those months. Thus, $\mathbb{P}(\mathrm{February\ |\ 29th}) = \frac {(\frac 3 {120})(\frac 1 {29})} {(\frac 3 {120})(\frac 1 {29}) + (\frac {40} {120})(\frac 1 {30}) + (\frac {70} {120})(\frac 1 {31})} = \frac {279} {9965}$ . While I perfectly understand my professor's logic for the second question, I cannot help but wonder why my idea is flawed.

Suppose I have two continuous differentiable surfaces $f,g:\mathbb{R}^N\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and there exists a point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=g(x_0)=0$ . Further $g(x)$ is non-zero everywhere else in the domain. I am interested in the surface $\frac{f}{g}$ , which must be continuous everywhere where $g$ is non-zero. Suppose I find a curve $C_1:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^N$ such that $x_0=C_1(0)$ and $x_1=C_1(1)$ for some $x_1 \in \mathbb{R}^N$ and I am able to show that: $$\lim_{y \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(C_1(y))}{g(C_1(y))}=k$$ The question which is confusing me is this: Does the existence of the above limit imply that if I were to find any curve function, say $C_2:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^N$ such that $x_0=C_2(0)$ and $x_2=C_2(1)$ for some $x_2 \in \mathbb{R}^N$ , it would be true that: $$\lim_{y \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(C_2(y))}{g(C_2(y))}=k$$ i.e. is the limit now the same along all curves? Or in other words, if I defined $h(x)=\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ for all $x\neq x_0$ and $h(x_0)=k$ would $h$ be continuous? My intuition for why the answer to the above should be ""yes, $h$ would be continuous"" is this: $x_0$ should be a ""removable"" discontinuous point for $\frac{f}{g}$ and therefore it seems it should have a well-defined limit at $x_0$ from all sides and that limit should be equal. My intuition for why the answer to the above should be ""no, $h$ is not continuous"" is this: Suppose additionally that $C_1$ and $C_2$ were differentiable everywhere and that $f$ and $g$ had a non-zero directional derivative along $C_1$ and $C_2$ . By L'hopitals rule, we would have: $$k=\lim_{y\rightarrow 0}\frac{(f \circ C_1) (y)}{(g \circ C_1) (y)}=\lim_{y\rightarrow 0}\frac{(f \circ C_1)' (y)}{(g \circ C_1)' (y)}=\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}\frac{\nabla_{C_1} f(x)}{\nabla_{C_1} g(x)}$$ and: $$k=\lim_{y\rightarrow 0}\frac{(f \circ C_2) (y)}{(g \circ C_2) (y)}=\lim_{y\rightarrow 0}\frac{(f \circ C_2)' (y)}{(g \circ C_2)' (y)}=\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}\frac{\nabla_{C_2} f(x)}{\nabla_{C_2} g(x)}$$ Thus: $$\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}\frac{\nabla_{C_1} f(x)}{\nabla_{C_1} g(x)}=\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}\frac{\nabla_{C_2} f(x)}{\nabla_{C_2} g(x)}$$ This seems like quite a strong statement and its hard for me to believe it is true for every curve $C_2$ such that $g$ has non-zero directional derivative along $C_2$ ...

Does it follow that $f$ is constant on $C$ ? In the previous question, $n\in\Bbb N\setminus\{1\}$ since the statement is clearly true when $n=1$ ; it's a classical theorem that follows from the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions . And if $C$ is open, it is also true.

Getting the Jacobian factors correct we find that our integral becomes: $A=4\int d^2z \frac{1}{(1+|z|^2)^2}$ Now I can write the integrand as double derivative: $\partial_{z}\partial_{\bar{z}}\ln(1+|z|^2)=\partial_z\frac{z}{1+|z|^2}=\frac{1}{1+|z|^2}-\frac{|z|^2}{(1+|z|^2)^2}=\frac{1}{(1+|z|^2)^2}$ So I can write the integral as: $A=\int d^2z \partial_z\partial_{\bar{z}}\ln(1+|z|^2)$ Now using integration by parts/Stokes theorem, the integral just evaluates to its value at the boundary of the integration manifold.

I want to prove the following: If $\mathcal{F}_x$ is a free $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ -module for some $x\in X$ then there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ such that $\mathcal{F}_{|U}$ is free My attempt Let $x_0$ be the point of $X$ in which $\mathcal{F}$ has free stalk.  Since $\mathcal{F}$ is coherent then  it is of finite type, so let $s_1,\dots,s_n\in\mathcal{F}(U)$ be local sections in a neighbourhood of $x_0$ such that $s_{1,x_0},\dots,s_{n,x_0}$ generate $\mathcal{F}_{x_0}\cong\mathcal{O}^n_{X,x_0}$ . One can easily show that $s_{1,x},\dots,s_{n,x}$ generate $\mathcal{F}_{x}$ for all $x\in V\subset U$ . In particular we obtain a surjective morphism \begin{equation*}\phi:\mathcal{O}^n_{|V}\to\mathcal{F}_{|V}
\end{equation*} But $\mathcal{F}$ is coherent so the kernel of such morphism is finitely generated and it is zero over $x_0$ ( I mean the stalk of the sheaf kernel is zero at $x_0$ ). In particular the induced map $\phi_{x_0}$ on the stalk is an isomorphism. So by some lemmata on stack exchange it follows that $\phi$ is injective when restricted to some $W\subset V$ neighbourhood of $x_0$ and in particular it gives an isomorphism between $\mathcal{O}^n_{|W}$ and $\mathcal{F}_{|W}$ . Now, I have two questions: 1) Does my argument work? 2) Where did I use the noetherian hypothesis on $X$ ?

4056809,Is there an equation for the number of iterations required to escape the Mandelbrot Set's bounding circle?,"The Mandelbrot Set is the set of all complex values $c$ that cause the recurrence relation $z_n = z_{n-1} + c$ to remain bounded within a circle of radius 2 when iterated from $z_0 = 0$ . In general, there is no way to prove that a given value of $c$ is a member of the set. Instead, we iterate the recurrence relation some large number of times until we either find some value of $n$ where $|z_n| > 2$ (proving that the current value of $c$ is not in the set) or give up and declare that the current value of $c$ is probably part of the set (or at least very close to it). When the value of $c$ is far from the set, $z_n$ quickly escapes the bounding circle. As $c$ gets closer to the set, the number of iterations $n$ required to exceed the bounding circle grows without bound. If we look at values of $c$ on the positive real axis only and plot how many iterations it takes to exceed the bounding circle, we get a graph like this: If $c$ is greater than two, it only takes one iteration to escape the circle because $z_0$ is always zero and $z_1$ is always $c$ . When $1 < c ≤ 2$ it takes two iterations. The next twelve transition values are approximately 0.68233, 0.5352, 0.4537, 0.4034, 0.36999, 0.34659, 0.32952, 0.31666, 0.30672, 0.29887, 0.29256, and 0.28741 — that's as far as I can get with WolframAlpha. Positive real values of $c$ less than or equal to 0.25 are part of the Mandelbrot Set and will never escape even after infinitely many iterations. To me, that looks very much like a graph of $1/x$ with some scaling and translating (for example, the vertical asymptote is at $x = 0.25$ ), but I can't find an equation that fits perfectly. Is there a formula that fits these points exactly? UPDATE based on responses from PM 2Ring and Claude As the distance $\epsilon$ from the boundary of the set tends towards zero on the positive real axis, the number of iterations required for escape tends towards $\frac{π} {\sqrt{ϵ}}$ . As $ϵ$ increases to 1.75 along the positive real axis, the relationship changes to $\frac{2\sqrt{1.75}} {\sqrt{ϵ}}$ . It seems like I need some function $v(ϵ)$ such that $\frac{v(ϵ)} {\sqrt{ϵ}}$ fits my points exactly. Based on the points I have, it looks like this: UPDATE 2 I calculated the iteration counts for $c = -0.75 + ϵ i$ and discovered that approaching the boundary of the set from this direction is more closely approximated by $\frac{π}{ϵ}$ than by $\frac{π}{\sqrt{ϵ}}$ . As in the first approach, the actual iteration count starts out far from the function and approaches it as $ϵ$ goes to zero, though it wobbles around more than it does when approaching from the positive real axis. It seems my hope for a single function to calculate iteration counts may go unfulfilled.","['curves', 'functions', 'closed-form', 'recreational-mathematics', 'fractals']"

4057040,Proof that $S_3 \simeq{\rm Aut}(S_3)$,"After consulting another post on this website, e.g., here Proving that ${\rm Aut}(S_3)$ is isomorphic to $S_3$ , I've come up with a proof that $S_3 \simeq {\rm Aut}(S_3)$ . Could someone look it over to tell me if there are any holes? I don't know if my proof of surjectivity is the best way to go about it. It almost feels like ""cheating."" I claim that $\phi: S_3 \to \mathrm{Aut}(S_3)$ sending $g \longmapsto c_g (x) = gxg^{-1}$ is an isomorphism. In general, $\phi: G \to \mathrm{Aut}(G)$ sending $g \longmapsto c_g$ is a homomorphism, so it suffices to show that $\phi$ is a bijection. We have: \begin{align*}
g \in \mathrm{ker}(\phi) & \iff \phi(g) = c_g (x) = x, \; \forall x \in G \\
& \iff gxg^{-1} = x, \; \forall x \in G \\
& \iff gx = xg, \; \forall x \in G \\
& \iff g \in Z(G) = \{e\},
\end{align*} so the kernel of $\phi$ is trivial, so $\phi$ is injective. Since $S_3$ has exactly $6$ elements which must be sent to distinct elements of the ${\rm Aut}(S_3)$ , this implies that $|{\rm Aut}(S_3)| \leq 6$ . I claim that $\phi$ is also surjective. We have $S_3 = \langle a = (12), b = (13), c = (23) \rangle$ , each of which has order $2$ . Since an automorphism $f \in{\rm Aut}(S_3)$ must preserve the order of elements, $f$ must send transpositions to transpositions. Furthermore, upon fixing where $f$ send these transpositions, the rest of the map is determined. Since there are $3!$ possibilities for where to send the permutations and these are the only possible automorphisms, we have $|{\rm Aut}(S_3)| \leq 6$ . Hence, $|{\rm Aut}(S_3)| = 6$ . But $\phi(S_3) \leq \text{Aut}(S_3)$ , so that they have the same order immediately implies that $\phi(S_3) = \text{Aut}(S_3)$ , so $\phi$ is surjective, hence bijective.","['symmetric-groups', 'group-theory', 'solution-verification', 'automorphism-group']"
4057053,Calculate the distance $h(t)=1+e^{-t}\cos(t)$ that drops,"A weight is hanging from a spring, and oscillates with heights modeled by the function $h(t)=1+e^{-t}\cos(t)$ at time $t\geq 0.$ Does it travel an infinite distance (in other words, does it converge or diverge) as $t\to\infty$ and also, what is the total distance that it drops ? Note : the distance dropped indicates only the downward motion of the function, not when the function increases. I have tried to plot this and it seems from the graph that it only drops to $\frac{3\pi}{4}$ and increases from that point on. I got a final answer of $\frac{1}{1-e^{-\pi}}.$ For the other question of whether the weight travels infinitely, the answer is a simple no.","['physics', 'calculus', 'functions', 'functional-analysis']"
4057082,Find constant $c$ such that all intersection points of two spheres have perpendicular tangent planes,"I have come to a problem in a multivariable calculus book that I'm having trouble with. The problem statement is : ""Find a constant $c$ such that for any point of intersection of the two spheres $(x-c)^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = 3$ and $x^{2} + (y-1)^{2} + z^{2} = 1$ , the corresponding
tangent planes will be perpendicular to each other."" So I define two functions : \begin{align}
f(x,y,z) & = (x-c)^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} - 3 \\
g(x,y,z) & = x^{2} + (y-1)^{2} + z^{2} - 1
\end{align} We denote the partial derivative with respect to $x$ as $f_{x}$ and so on...
We see : \begin{align}
f_{x}(x,y,z) & = 2(x-c) = 2x - 2c\\
f_{y}(x,y,z) & = 2y\\
f_{z}(x,y,z) & = 2z

g_{x}(x,y,z) & = 2x \\
g_{y}(x,y,z) & = 2(y-1) = 2y - 2 \\
g_{z}(x,y,z) & = 2z
\end{align} I assume that if the tangent planes of the two spheres are perpendicular at an intersection point, then the normals are also perpendicular. So for every intersection point (x,y,z)
we have : \begin{equation}
\bigtriangledown f(x,y,z) \cdot \bigtriangledown g(x,y,z) = 0

4(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) - 4(xc + y) & = 0\\
\cancel{4} \left[ (x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}) - (xc + y) \right] & = 0\\
(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}) - (xc + y) & = 0 \\
x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} & = xc + y

\require{cancel}
f(x,y,z) & = x^{2} - 2xc + c^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} - 3 \\
         & = (x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}) + (c^{2} - 2xc - 3) \\
g(x,y,z) & = x^{2} + y^{2} - 2y + \cancel{1} + z^{2} - \cancel{1} \\
         & = (x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}) - 2y
\end{align} and : \begin{align}
f(x,y,z) = 0 & \Rightarrow (x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}) = -(c^{2}-2xc-3) = -c^{2} + 2xc + 3\\
g(x,y,z) = 0 & \Rightarrow (x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}) = 2y
\end{align} So we have : \begin{equation}
xc + y = -c^{2} + 2xc + 3 = 2y

Now suppose that X has a prosthetic hip joint and that X's hip joint becomes infected by staphylococcus aureus. Given only the information provided here, is it correct to say that X's hip joint probably would not have become infected but for the fact that X has a prosthetic hip joint (instead of a natural hip joint)?

4057147,On the equivalence of the squares of prime numbers p and q in modular pq-1.,"Find all prime numbers (p,q) such that $p\not=q$ and $p^2≡q^2$ (mod $pq-1$ ). Edit 1: So what I got so far is that, if p=2 and q=2k+1, then $4≡4k^2+4k+1≡4k^2$ (mod $4k+1$ ). Adding 16k to both sides, we get $15k≡0$ (mod $4k+1$ ). Adding k+4 to both sides gives us $0≡k+4$ (mod $4k+1$ ). Since k+4<4k+1 for all k>1, k=1, so q=3. This gives the solutions (2,3) and (3,2). Now we can assume p and q are odd, and get $p^2-q^2≡(p+q)(p-q)≡(p+q)(p-1)(q+1)≡0$ . Plugging in $p=2k+1$ and $q=2j-1$ yields $(2k+2j)(2k)(2j)≡0$ (mod $4kj-2k+2j-2$ ). Dividing by 2 we get $(k+j)(2k)(2j)≡0$ (mod $2kj-k+j-1$ ). Now we get $(k+j)(4kj)≡(k+j)(2k-2j+2)=2k^2+2k-2j^2+2j≡0$ (mod $2kj-k+j-1$ ). From here I get kind of stuck lol. I think this equivalence does have infinite solutions... Edit 2: Actually if p and q are 1 and 3 in mod 4, plugging in shows that pq-1=2, which has no solutions. Therefore p and q are both the same in modular 4. Not sure how this helps though.","['number-theory', 'modular-arithmetic', 'prime-numbers']"

What is the relationship between MCF and diffusive flows and how can one explain this geometrically? Honestly I'm not even sure whether ""diffusive flow"" is a term, but by that I mean evolution of a curve as described by the heat equation/heat kernel. Edit: I also read somewhere that Ricci flow on a surface effectively evolves the curvature of the surface with a heat equation.

4057289,When exactly is the principal AGM equal to the optimal AGM?,"Definitions Following the terminology of SageMath , let the principal arithmetic-geometric mean, $\operatorname{AGP}$ , of $(a,b)\in\mathbb{C}^2$ for $a\ne 0$ , $b\ne 0$ , $a\ne\pm b$ be defined as follows: $$a_0=a,\, b_0=b,\\
a_{n+1}=\frac{a_n+b_n}{2},\,b_{n+1}=\sqrt{a_n b_n},\\
\operatorname{AGP}(a,b)=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n,$$ where at each $b$ -iteration, $\sqrt{}$ is chosen such that $\operatorname{Re}b_n\ge 0$ for $n\gt 0$ . This corresponds to always taking the so-called ""principal square root"" (which is usually denoted just by $\sqrt{}$ ). Similarly, define the optimal arithmetic-geometric mean, $\operatorname{AGO}$ , of $(a,b)\in\mathbb{C}^2$ for $a\ne 0$ , $b\ne 0$ , $a\ne\pm b$ as follows: $$a_0=a,\, b_0=b,\\
a_{n+1}=\frac{a_n+b_n}{2},\,b_{n+1}=\pm\sqrt{a_n b_n},\\
\operatorname{AGO}(a,b)=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n,$$ where at each $b$ -iteration, a $+$ or a $-$ sign is chosen such that $|a_n-b_n|\le |a_n+b_n|$ for $n\gt 0$ . If $|a_n-b_n|=|a_n+b_n|$ , there is an ambiguity, so in case that happens, it is also required that $\operatorname{Im}(b_n/a_n)\gt 0$ . Note that the condition which solves the ambiguity if $|a_n-b_n|=|a_n+b_n|$ is either not implemented in the algorithm used in SageMath, or it is implemented but not documented on their official website. Following the terminology of Cox , a pair of sequences $\{a_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ and $\{b_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is good if $b_{n+1}$ is the right choice for $\pm \sqrt{a_n b_n}$ for all but finitely many $n\ge 0$ . The right choice is exactly what $\operatorname{AGO}$ chooses at each $b$ -iteration. Now define the multivalued arithmetic-geometric mean as $$\operatorname{AGM}(a,b)=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n$$ whenever $\{a_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ and $\{b_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ are good sequences. It is a complex multi-function of two variables which has a countable number of values. Let $\mathbb{H}=\{\tau\in\mathbb{C}:\,\operatorname{Im}\tau\gt 0\}$ and $$\theta_3 (\tau ,0)=1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathrm{q}^{n^2}=p (\tau),$$ $$\theta_4 (\tau ,0)=1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n\mathrm{q}^{n^2}=q (\tau)$$ where $\mathrm{q}=e^{\pi i\tau}$ is the elliptic nome. An interesting theorem Cox uses modular functions to prove the following theorem: Let $|a|\ge |b|$ . Then all possible values of $\operatorname{AGM}(a,b)$ are given by $$\frac{1}{\operatorname{AGM}(a,b)}=\frac{d}{\operatorname{AGO}(a,b)}+i\frac{c}{\operatorname{AGO}(a-b,a+b)}$$ where $d$ and $c$ are any relatively prime integers such that $d\equiv 1\pmod 4$ and $c\equiv 0\pmod 4$ . To see the connection between modular functions and $\operatorname{AGM}$ , one can observe that $p^2(2\tau)$ is the arithmetic mean of $p^2(\tau)$ and $q^2(\tau)$ , and that $q(2\tau)$ is the geometric mean of $p(\tau)$ and $q(\tau)$ . Cox's paper explores the connection in greater detail. Question There is a non-empty set in $\mathbb{C}^2$ where $\operatorname{AGP}(a,b)=\operatorname{AGO}(a,b)$ . What is it exactly? Some examples: $$\color{green}{\operatorname{AGP}(2+3i,1+i)\approx 1.466+1.871i,}\,\color{green}{\operatorname{AGO}(2+3i,1+i)\approx 1.466+1.871i}$$ $$\color{red}{\operatorname{AGP}(-0.95-0.65i,0.683+0.747i)\approx 0.338-0.0135i,}\,\color{red}{\operatorname{AGO}(-0.95-0.65i,0.683+0.747i)\approx -0.371+0.319i}$$ An example with a $1$ is the following: $\operatorname{AGP}(1,-2-i)\ne\operatorname{AGO}(1,-2-i)$ . Motivation $\operatorname{AGO}$ has the nice relation to the values of $\operatorname{AGM}$ in the complex plane, which the $\operatorname{AGP}$ seems to be lacking. The ""interesting theorem"" produces a multitude of values and it seems pretty hard to distill $\operatorname{AGP}$ from them. Note also that the homogenity relation $\lambda f(a,b)=f(\lambda a,\lambda b)$ holds for the real arithmetic-geometric mean, but not necessarily for complex $\operatorname{AGP}$ . For example, let $a=-0.95-0.65i$ and $b=0.683+0.747i$ . Then, curiously, $$a\operatorname{AGP}\left(1,\frac{b}{a}\right)=\operatorname{AGO}(a,b)\ne\operatorname{AGP}(a,b).$$ This is caused by the fact that $w\sqrt{z}=\sqrt{w^2z}$ does not hold for some $w,z\in\mathbb{C}$ . There is also a remarkable connection between $\operatorname{AGO}$ and the hypergeometric function which is taken from Fungrim : Let $(a,b)\in\mathbb{C}^2$ and $a/b\notin (-\infty ,0]$ . Then $$\operatorname{AGO}(a,b)=\frac{a+b}{2\,_2\mathrm{F}_1 \left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},1,\left(\frac{a-b}{a+b}\right)^2\right)}.$$ Complex plots Using the color function I made the following plots: The horizontal axis represents $\operatorname{Re}z$ and the vertical axis represents $\operatorname{Im}z$ .

(this was done as a result of $\sqrt{x^2}= |x|$ while changing the limits).  This will be the root cause of the trouble that follows:- $$\frac{2a^5}{15} \int_{-\pi / 2}^{\pi / 2} (1-\left| \sin^5\phi \right|)\,d\phi = \frac{2a^5}{15} ( \pi - I)$$ Now, had the $| \cdot |$ not been present in $E01$ , then $I$ would be $0$ , since $\sin^5\phi$ is odd. So the answer would be $2\pi/15$ . But, the $|\cdot|$ means that $I$ would be something positive, which would mean the answer is something less than $2\pi/15$ . However, the given answer is: $2\pi/15$ . Which made me question the existence of the $|\cdot|$ . Seems to be rather trivial that the $|\cdot|$ should be there.....The second scope for an error could be in determining the limits of the integral...But that seems fine too.

Given AC we even know that there is some aleph $\aleph_\alpha$ such that $\vert B\vert = \aleph_\alpha$ and thus any vector-space-structure over $K$ appears in the sequence $\lbrace \bigoplus_{i\in \aleph_\alpha}K:\alpha\in Ord\rbrace$ .

This article https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.3829.pdf is an exhaustive study of the problem. Original post Consider the subset of the natural numbers $n\ge 1$ which have at least one square prime factor. These can be formally defined by $\mu (n) = 0$ , where $\mu$ is the Möbius function. The first 40 of these are $$s_{0}=\{4,8,9,12,16,18,20,24,25,27,28,32,36,40,44,45,48,49,50,52,54,56,60,63,64,68,72,75,76,80,81,84,88,90,92,96,98,99,100,104\}$$ Closer inspection of $s_{0}$ shows that there are sequences of consecutive such numbers. We call them compact sequences .

Prolonging the list $s_0$ we find also longer compact sequences, and, again, for a given length there is more than one sequence.

The vertex-induced subgraph may appear 64 times in a graph with 64 vertices. There are many random graphs with this property, but some graphs are sets of disjoint torified rectangular square grids. (Torified means that opposite vertices on the sides of a rectangular square grid are connected.) For example two torified square grids with 4x8 vertices each, or four torified square grids with 2x4 vertices each. So the number of such multiple torus graphs is the number I am looking for (for $64$ ). In other words: I am looking for the composite partition function of natural numbers.

That is, $\zeta_1(x,y)$ is odd in $x$ while $\zeta_2(x,y)$ is even in $x$ . Now considering the continuous rotation about the origin, I think (but have not proven) that it would be sufficient to show $$\frac{d}{d\epsilon}\bigg\rvert_{\epsilon=0}\zeta(\psi(\epsilon,(x,y)))=\frac{d}{d\epsilon}\bigg\rvert_{\epsilon=0}\psi(\epsilon,\zeta(x,y))$$ $$\Downarrow$$ $$\boldsymbol{v}(\zeta)(x)=\boldsymbol{v}\bigg\rvert_{(x,y)=\zeta(x,y)}$$ where $\boldsymbol{v}=y\partial_x-x\partial_y$ is the infinitesimal generator of the O(2). I found that this equation determines a first-order system of PDEs, $$\zeta_2=y\partial_x\zeta_1-x\partial_y\zeta_1$$ $$-\zeta_1=y\partial_x\zeta_2-x\partial_y\zeta_2$$ which does not seem right. Am I completely off base here? I'm new to Lie groups and algebras so I'm open to all kinds of criticism.","['characteristics', 'symmetry', 'lie-groups', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
4058162,Epsilon-delta proofs,"$\newcommand{\absval}[1]{\left\lvert #1 \right\rvert}$ I am self-learning Real Analysis from Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abott. I am getting back to $\delta-\epsilon$ arguments after a break, so I'd like ask if my $\delta$ -response to the below $\epsilon$ -challenges is technically correct and rigorous. Problem 4.2.2. For each stated limit, find the largest possible $\delta-$ neighbourhood that is a proper response to the given $\epsilon$ -challenge. (a) $\lim_{x \to 3}(5x - 6) = 9$ , where $\epsilon = 1$ (b) $\lim_{x \to 4}\sqrt{x} = 2$ , where $\epsilon = 1$ (c) $\lim_{x \to \pi} [[x]] = 3$ , where $\epsilon = 1$ . (The function $[[x]]$ returns the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$ ) (d) $\lim_{x \to \pi} [[x]] = 3$ , where $\epsilon = 0.01$ Proof. (a) We would like to make the distance $\absval{(5x - 6) - 9}<1$ , so $\absval{5x - 15} < 1$ , thus $\absval{x - 3} < 1/5$ . Thus, $\delta = 1/5$ . (b) The expression $\absval{\sqrt{x} - 2}$ can be written as, \begin{align*}
	\sqrt{x} - 2 &= (\sqrt{x} - 2) \times \frac{(\sqrt{x} + 2)}{(\sqrt{x} + 2)}\\
	&= \frac{\absval{(x - 4)}}{\absval{\sqrt{x} + 2}}\\
	&\le \frac{\absval{(x - 4)}}{2}\\
	&< \frac{\delta}{2}
\end{align*} So, if we pick $\delta = 2$ , the distance $\absval{\sqrt{x} - 2}$ would be smaller than $\epsilon = 1$ . (c) Consider the expression $\absval{[[x]] - 3}$ . We are interested to make the distance $\absval{[[x]] - 3}$ smaller than $\epsilon = 1$ . So, $2 < [[x]] < 4$ . Therefore, $[[x]]=3$ . This is true, if and only if, $3 \le x < 4$ . Consequently, $3 - \pi \le x - \pi < 4 - \pi$ . This inequality is satisfied, if the distance $\absval{x - \pi} < \pi - 3$ . So, $\delta = \pi - 3$ . (d) Again, $\delta = \pi - 3$ is a proper response to the given $\epsilon-$ challenge.","['limits', 'solution-verification', 'epsilon-delta', 'real-analysis']"

4058338,Proof that the sum of exterior angles of a complex polygon or a non-planar polygon is greater than 2 Pi,"In the context of writing a ray-tracing program, I must be able to determine if a polygon in three-dimensional space is a planar simple convex polygon. My conjecture is that if I take the sum of the exterior angles (absolute values, always in the range $[0, \pi]$ ) then this sum is equal to $2\pi$ if and only if it is a planar simple convex polygon. I firmly believe this to be true, but I seek somewhat rigorous proof. I already managed to show that the sum equals $2\pi$ for convex polygons and that it exceeds $2\pi$ for concave ones. However, I do not have any ideas on how to continue to prove that complex and non-planar polygons have a sum of exterior angles greater than $2\pi$ . For complex planar polygons, I managed to show (w.l.o.g.) that the exterior angles which ""turn to the right"" minus those that ""turn to the left"" must be a $2\pi n$ for some natural $n$ . From there it's trivial to show that if $n>1$ then the total must be greater than $2\pi$ , but for $n=0$ and $n=1$ I do not know how to proceed. For non-planar polygons, I thought about what would happen if we project it to 2-dimensions then somehow show that the projection has an exterior angle sum strictly between $2\pi$ and that of the non-planar version, but I once again cannot fathom how to show that. (Edit: this idea does not work since there are counterexamples of non-planar polygons whose projections onto two-dimensional space have a larger exterior angle sum.)","['3d', 'computational-geometry', 'angle', 'geometry', 'polygons']"

Clearly I could explicitly calculate $dy/dx$ and $dx/dy$ and check the equality, but is there a better way to see this equality from the point of view of the properties of the functions. Here, by functions I mean functions that commonly appear in physics (and definitely not some exotic function that has no physical origins - this is the reason I decided to post it in PhysicsSE and not MathSE). If there exist any such properties, I would also like to have a mathematical proof that states that these properties are equivalent to proving the equality explicitly from the first principle i.e. using (1) and (2).

Since $2n-1$ and $2b-1$ are always odd, they will never by powers of 2. Thus, $2^{m-1}(2n-1)=2^{a-1}(2b-1)\implies 2^{m-1}=2^{a-1}\implies m-1=a-1\implies m=a$ . Thus, we have $2^{m-1}(2n-1)=2^{m-1}(2b-1)\implies 2n-1=2b-1\implies n=b$ .
Thus, $(m,n)=(a,b)$ . Onto: Let $y=2^{m-1}(2n-1)\in\mathbb{N}\implies 2^{m-1}\in\mathbb{N}$ (even) and $2n-1\in\mathbb{N}$ (odd) $\implies m\in\mathbb{N}(m\geq1)$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}(n\geq1)$ $\implies (m,n)\in\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ .
Thus for every $y\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists and $(m,n)\in\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(m,n)=y$ .

My attempt: I was given the hint that I should check each of the following: (1) a function $f(x) = \frac{x}{x+1}$ is montone increasing, (2) the triangle inequality applies to $\frac{|x_n - y_n|}{(1 + |x_n - y_n|)}$ and (3) the metric itself satisfies the inequality. (1) $f$ is monotone increasing: If $x \geq 0$ , $f'(x) = \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2} > 0$ . So $f$ is increasing. (2) Triangle inequality applies: We have $|x_n-y_n|≤|x_n-z_n|+|z_n-y_n|$ and so $\frac {|x_n-y_n|}{1+|x_n-y_n|}≤ \frac {|x_n-z_n|+|z_n-y_n|}{1+|x_n-z_n|+|z_n-y_n|}=\frac {|x_n-z_n|}{1+|x_n-z_n|+|z_n-y_n|} + \frac {|z_n-y_n|}{1+|x_n-z_n|+|z_n-y_n|}≤\frac{|x_n-z_n|}{1+|x_n-z_n|}+\frac {|z_n-y_n|}{1+|z_n-y_n|}$ Therefore $\frac{|x_n - z_n|}{1 + |x_n - z_n|}+\frac{|z_n-y_n|}{1 + |z_n-y_n|} \geq \frac{|x_n-y_n|}{1 + |x_n-y_n|}$ .

When $D$ is convex, is it true that $H(x)\ge 0$ at $\partial D$ ? I'm looking for the proof or a reference where I can find such results.","['curvature', 'reference-request', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
4058968,Different answers after different methods in solving a limit,Evaluate $$L=\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{\sin(x)}-(1+\sin(x))}{(\arctan(\sin(x)))^2}$$ Method $1$ : $$\frac{h^2\left(\frac{e^{h}-1}{h^2}-\frac1{h}\right)}{(\arctan(h))^2}=1^2\left(\frac{1*1}{h}-\frac1{h}\right)=\frac1{h}-\frac1{h}=0$$ Therefore $L=0$ . The identities I have used here to simplify the expression are $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\arctan\left(x\right)}{x}=1$$ $$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{a^{x}-1}{a}=\ln\left(a\right) \implies \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{x}-1}{x}=\ln\left(e\right)=1$$ Method $2$ : $$L=\frac{e^{h}-\left(1+h\right)}{\left(\arctan\left(h\right)\right)^{2}}=\frac{\left(1+h+\frac{h^{2}}{2!}\right)-\left(1+h\right)}{\left(\arctan\left(h\right)\right)^{2}}=\frac{\left(\frac{h^{2}}{2!}\right)}{\left(\arctan\left(h\right)\right)^{2}}=\frac{1}{2}$$ Therefore $L=\frac12$ . I am not at all familiar with $O(n)$ notation BTW.,['limits']
4058979,"Prove that $\int_0^1\log\left(\Lambda-\sqrt{\Lambda^2+C}\sin(\pi x+D)\right)\,dx\le\frac{\Lambda-1}2+\frac{\Lambda\sinh\pi\sqrt C}{2\pi\sqrt C}$","Consider the generalised Poincaré inequality [1] $$\left\||u|^2\right\|_{L^1}-\left\||u|^2\right\|_{L^{1/p}}\le(p-1)C_p(\mu)\int|\nabla u|^2\,d\mu$$ for $u\in H^1(\mu)$ , $p\in(1,2]$ and some positive constant $C_p(\mu)$ . The special case $p=2$ over the finite interval $[0,1]\in\Bbb R^1$ yields the convex Sobolev inequality [2] $$\int_0^1\phi(u)\,dx-\phi\left(\int_0^1u\,dx\right)\le\frac1{2\pi^2}\int_0^1\left(\frac{\partial\psi(u)}{\partial x}\right)^2\,dx$$ where $\phi$ is convex, $(\phi'')^{-1/2}$ is concave and $\psi'^2=\phi''$ . In particular, we can take $\psi=-\phi=\log$ to obtain the result $$F(x,u,u’):=\int_0^1\log u\,dx+\frac1{2\pi^2}\int_0^1\frac{u'^2}{u^2}\,dx\ge0$$ which is shown in Prove that $0\le\int_0^1\log(u){\rm d}x+\frac1{2\pi^2}\int_0^1\frac1{u^2}\left(\frac{{\rm d}u}{{\rm d}x}\right)^2{\rm d}x$ . This is of course, an easy consequence of a rather advanced result so I tried a calculus of variations approach. With the additional constraint that $u(x)$ is a positive, differentiable density function, we define the functional $F(x,u,u’)+\lambda\int_0^1u\,dx$ which yields the stationary path $$u_s(x)=\frac1{\Lambda-\sqrt{\Lambda^2+C}\sin(\pi x+D)}$$ where $C,\Lambda=-\lambda>0$ are subject to $\sqrt{\Lambda^2+C}\cos D\tanh(\pi\sqrt C/2)=-\sqrt C$ . Thus the inequality becomes ( details in my answer to linked question ) $$\int_0^1\log\left(\Lambda-\sqrt{\Lambda^2+C}\sin(\pi x+D)\right)\,dx\le\frac{\Lambda-1}2+\frac{\Lambda\sinh\pi\sqrt C}{2\pi\sqrt C}\tag1$$ for all $C,D$ whenever $u_s(x)$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ and $F(x,u_s,u_s')$ is defined and finite. Is there a way to prove $(1)$ directly? References [1] Bartier, J-P., Doubault, J. (2006). Convex Sobolev inequalities and spectral gap. Comptes Rendus Mathematique. 342(5) :307-312. [2] Matthes, D.
