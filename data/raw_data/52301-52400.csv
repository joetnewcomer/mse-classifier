546380,Evaluating $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}x_{n+1}-x_n$,"Let $f(x)$ be continuously differentiable on $[0,1]$ and $$x_n = f\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)+f\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)+f\left(\frac{3}{n}\right)+\ldots+f\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)$$ Find $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(x_{n+1}-x_n\right)$$ Confusion : I just found a subtle problem in my solution.By the definition of definite integration, like $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_i^*)\Delta x$, the sample point $x_i^*$ should be included in its $ith$ subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$. In this case, I am not sure whether the subinterval $[\frac{i-1}{n(n+1)},\frac{i}{n(n+1)}]$ includes the sample point $i$ and $\xi_i$ or not.I can not deduce it from the given condition, $$\xi_i \in [\frac{i}{n+1},\frac{i}{n}] \implies \frac{i-1}{n(n+1)}\lt \frac{i}{n+1}\lt\xi_i\lt?\lt\frac{i}{n}$$ If those sample points is not always included in the corresponding subinterval, I might not apply the definite integration here. Hope somebody can take a look at this solution. Update: I rewrite part of my solution and fixed the problem I have before.

546427,Kalman filtering correlated measurements,"I would like to run a Kalman filter over a set of measurements which may (will) be correlated.  Essentially, each new measurement contains (say) 90% of the same information from the previous measurement.  The measurements are made by integrating over time, and subsequent measurements are taken by overlapping integrations. For various reasons, I can't necessarily decimate the measurements so that they are independent of each other, but if I apply each measurement at its full weighting, the filter will become over confident and its covariance will shrink too quickly. My first thought is that there must be someway to increase the covariance from each measurement so that it doesn't overly affect the filter state, but I would like a rigorously correct solution, and I welcome any pointers. A least squares approach which allowed expressing the correlated measurements would also be welcome, but I kind of prefer the Kalman filter because it gives me a running covariance as well as the filtered result. Thank you in advance for any pointers!  Is there a better stack exchange for this question?","['statistics', 'bayesian-network', 'probability', 'kalman-filter']"

I first start with $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty Ai$. I know that when you expand it out, you'll get ${(0,1), (0,2), (0,3),...} $ which will keep continuing all the way to infinity. Since it is asking for the intersection of all the sets, it is asking for the set which has elements that are members of all the sets in the collection. Would the correct answer be $A_n = (0,Z^+) $, where $Z^+$ is the set of positive integers? Now for $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty Ai$. This is asking for the set which has elements that are members of at least one set in the collection. Since $i$ goes all the way up to infinity, isn't there an infinite possible amount of answers here? For example, one answer could be $(0,1)=A_{n_1}$. Or it could even be $A_{n_2} = (0,Z^+) $?

  $$S_A$$ satisfies $$1\leq S_A \leq 9+10+...+14=69$$ and there are $$2^6-1=63$$

546493,probability of no matching or exactly one matching and generalization,"I had the following question in a midterm today: There are $10$ pairs of shoes. One randomly selects $8$ shoes.

What I wrote as a solution is : $\textbf{a)}$ We randomly select one shoe, then two select the second one so that we don't violate the requirement we can select any of the 18 out of the 19 shoes left. Then for the third shoes that we will select we can select  any of the 16 out of the 18 shoes left and so on. So we get that :
$$ P = \frac{18}{19}\frac{16}{18}\frac{14}{17}\frac{12}{16}\frac{10}{15}\frac{8}{14}\frac{6}{13}.$$
$\textbf{b)}$ The probability to pick exactly one pair of shoes is the probability of getting a pair of shoes and then getting no matching pairs for the remaining $18$ shoes(and to compute this we apply same logic as in part a) $$P=\frac{10}{\dbinom{20}{2}} \cdot \frac{16}{17}\frac{14}{16}\frac{12}{15}\frac{10}{14}\frac{8}{13}.$$ $\textbf{Firstly:}$ I know that my solution is quite ugly but is it right at least?

546516,Stability for Nonlinear System,"I am trying to assess the (Liapunov) stability of the equilibrium at $(0,0)$ of the system
\begin{align*}
x_1' &= -4x_2 + x_1^2 \\
x_2' &= 4x_1 + x_2^2.
\end{align*}
I plotted the phase portrait in Mathematica, and it looks like a stable (but not asymptotically stable) equilibrium, with orbits circling about the origin.
However, my professor tells me the origin is actually unstable.
I don't know how to prove or disprove this rigorously. The equilibrium is non-hyperbolic, and I haven't been able to find a Liapunov function for the system. Any guidance would be appreciated. Edit: I tried polar coordinates: I get 
$$ r' = \frac1r(x_1x_1' + x_2x_2') = r^2(\cos^3 \theta + \sin^3 \theta)$$
and 
$$ \theta' = \frac{x_1x_2'-x_1'x_2}{r^2} = 4 + r\cos\theta\sin\theta(\sin\theta-\cos\theta).$$
So there's a half-plane where $r$ is increasing and a half-plane where it's decreasing. The angle $\theta$ is increasing in a neighborhood of the origin.
Is it reasonable to say that since 
$$ 0 = \int_{\theta_0}^{\theta_0 + 2\pi} \cos^3 \theta + \sin^3 \theta d\theta = \int_{\theta_0}^{\theta_0 + 2\pi} \frac{r'}{r^2} d\theta = \int_{\theta_0}^{\theta_0 + 2\pi} \left(\frac{1}{r}\right)' d\theta, $$

546873,Another proof for Liouville's Theorem,"I'm having trouble completing a homework question which will produce an alternative proof for Liouville's Theorem. The question reads Let $f$ be an entire function. Evaluate, for $|a|<R,|b|<R,\int_{|z|=R}\frac{f(z)dz}{(z-a)(z-b)}$. When $f$ is bounded, let $R\to \infty$ and deduce another proof for Liouville's Theorem. Liouville's Theorem: If a function f is entire and bounded in the complex plane, then $f(z)$ is constant throughout the plane. So I begin by evaluating the integral. Using the Cauchy-Residue theorem (and skipping some methodic computation) I have that $\int_{|z|=R}\frac{f(z)dz}{(z-a)(z-b)}=2\pi i[\frac{f(a)-f(b)}{a-b}].$Now, it is given that $f$ is entire (analytic everywhere) and bounded. Thus all I must show is that it is constant. Since $f$ is bounded there exists some non-negative number $M$ such that $|f(z)|<M$. I proceed by using the M-L Lemma in attempts to try and generate some ideas. $|\frac{f(z)dz}{(z-a)(z-b)}|\leq\frac{M}{(R-a)(R-b)}\times 2\pi R$, by the conditions given in the question and the use of the reverse triangle inequality. Hence, $|\int_{|z|=R}\frac{f(z)dz}{(z-a)(z-b)}|\leq\frac{M}{(R-a)(R-b)}\times 2\pi R$. Now as $R\to\infty$, the RHS of the inequality clearly approaches 0. Thus $\int_{|z|=R}\frac{f(z)dz}{(z-a)(z-b)}=0?$ I think I saw this in one of my text books. Does this lead on to the conclusion that $f(z)$ is constant? But then I realise I have not made use of the equation I established above. Thank you to all in advanced for you help.",['complex-analysis']

547035,How many Hamiltonian loop are there in a big rectangle?,"Suppose I have some big rectangle made of $n \times m$ squares, and I want to place tiles on it in a manner that makes a picture of a hamiltonian loop. I can transform this problem into a problem of putting squares with matching borders in the rectangle. Say I color the bottom and left sides of the rectangle yellow (and keep the top and right side white). Then, hamiltonian loops correspond to tilings of the rectangle with the following tiles, while keeping matching borders between tiles If I fix one dimension of the rectangle (say $m$), one can compute the number of matching tilings by computing a particular coefficient of the $n$-th power of a square matrix of size $5^m$ $A_m$ : let $I_m$ be the set of sequences $s$ of length $m$ of vertical colors. Consider $V = \Bbb Z^{I_m}$ and let $A \in End(V)$ be the matrix such that $A_{s,t}$ is the number of ways to have a column of $m$ tiles, with yellow on the bottow, white at the top, whose left border is $s$ and whose right border is $t$. Then $N(m,n) = (A^n)_{yellow,white}$ counts the number of hamiltonian loops in the rectangle $n \times m$. Computing the eigenvalues of $A$, we learn about the asymptotic behaviour of $N(m,n)$ for large $n$. For example if the eigenvalue with greatest modulus $\lambda_m$ is real and positive then $N(m,n) \sim C_m \lambda_m^n$. Can we say anything about the asymptotic behaviour for large $n$ and $m$ ? Because we originally use $6$ tiles, we obviously have $N(m,n) \le 6^{nm}$, so the set $\{|\lambda_m|^{1/m}\}$ has a $\limsup$ $\lambda \le 6$. Now, I would be interested in a few questions : Is $\lambda$ algebraic ? Can we compute it ? Do we have $\lim_{m \to \infty} |\lambda_m|^{1/m} = \lambda$ ? Do we have $\lim_{m,n \to \infty} N(m,n)^{1/mn} = \lambda$ ?

$$
\# X^f = \sum (-1)^i \operatorname{tr}(f^\ast,\operatorname{H}^i(X,\mathbb{Q}))

Thus, the given integral is $$I=\int u\cos(u)\sin^2(u)\ du$$ Now, we do the substitution $v=\pi-u$, so $dv=-du$ and
 $$I=-\int (\pi-v)\cos(\pi-v)\sin^2(\pi-v)\ dv$$ Since $\cos(\pi-v)=-\cos(v)$ and $\sin(\pi-v)=\sin(v)$, it follows that $$I=\int (\pi-v)\cos(v)\sin^2(v)\ dv$$ As a consequence, $$I=\int\pi\cos(v)\sin^2(v)\ dv-I=\frac{\pi\sin^3(v)}{3}-I=\frac{\pi x^3}{3}-I$$.

A suitable scaling (by $\frac{r'}{r}$) will make $A$ congruent to $A'$, and a translation will map the scaled $A$ onto $A'$. This is clearly a conformal homeomorphism. Necessity: The annulus $A$ has the following set of periods $$\left\{ \pm \frac{2 \pi}{\log (R/r)} \right\} $$
(this step required some computations which I will omit) Similarly $A'$ has $$\left\{ \pm \frac{2 \pi}{ \log(R'/r')} \right\}$$

547517,Infinite disjoint class of open subsets in an infinite Hausdorff space.,"Let X be an infinite Hausdorff space. Prove that there exist an infinite disjoint class of open subsets of X. Ok the first time I tried to prove this I started by taking pairwise disjoint sets given by the Hausdorff property and then taking the intersection of all those sets for each point; but you can only prove the finite case by doing this, since one can only assert that the finite intersection of open set is an open set. So there must be a different reasoning for the infinite case (if it is in fact true). Then I thought that the statement was false, since you can take a set, for example $\mathbb{R}$ which has a countable dense subset $\mathbb{Q}$, then it would be impossible to create such class taking the pairwise disjoints sets for every point in $\mathbb{R}$. But this was no counterexample since one can take for example all the balls $B_{\frac{1}{2}}(n)$ where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and you get and infinite family of open disjoint subsets. At this point I think the assertion must be true, but I have no clue of how to prove it. Trying to construct this infinite family of disjoint open subsets for an arbitrary Hausdorff space has proven to be a difficult problem, so I also tried to prove the assertion by contradiction, but I haven't had any luck either by using this approach. Do you have any suggestions? is the statement even true?

For example, if we treat complex numbers like vectors, then the Cauchy-Riemann equations tell us that the derivative exists if the divergence and curl are both zero, which is equivalent to saying that our field is conservative, and there's no field sources/sinks. That these functions also satisfy Laplace's equation is also fairly obvious, since Laplace's equation describes a conservative field with no field sources. Essentially, to what extent can we pretend the complex numbers are vectors, and bring over useful results from vector calculus? If this doesn't work, then what are the major flaws, or things to watch out for? Edit: The reason I'm looking for analogs between vector analysis and complex analysis is because results in vector analysis usually have clear physical interpretations. I'm hoping to enhance my understanding of complex analysis through the similarities. Additionally, if I know a proof for certain proprerties of vector functions, I probably shouldn't focus my attention on the proof of an equivalent property in complex analysis. Instead, I'd prefer to focus attention on results that don't have a correspondence to vector analysis.

Simple manipulations of the inequality from Schwarz's lemma give the result. (c) Looking at part (a), we know that $\mathrm{Re} f(z) \neq 0$, and so $f(z) \neq 0$.

547691,"Quantifying the ""flatness"" of functions which are the Fourier transforms of positive functions","I have a question which I admit is a little cumbersome for me to try to state succinctly, and which I fear may not have a simple answer, but I figured I'd give it a shot. In broad terms, I'm trying to understand the extent to which a function is prevented from being ""flat"" as a result of being the Fourier transform of a positive function. I'll admit that one of the issues is that I don't have a very good working definition of what I mean by ""flat,"" which is part of what I'm trying to resolve. My question in some sense is also asking about the allowed behaviour of characteristic functions. Allow me to be more specific. For reasons involving some physics research I've been working on, I've been dealing with a function $f \left ( t\right )$ which is the Fourier transform of a real, non-negative, and even function, $f \left ( t \right ) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}d \omega ~g \left ( \omega \right )e^{i \omega t}$ That is, the function $g$ has the property of being real, even in $\omega$, and strictly non-negative. I'm aware of some basic results, including the fact that $f$ must be also real, even, etc. I'm also aware of some less trivial results such as Bochner's theorem. But what I'm concerned with is slightly more subtle I think. Some of the research I've been doing involves situations in which the function $f$ has a very smooth plateau, remaining relatively stationary for a while, with small, slow oscillations around an average value, before later decaying to zero over a relatively short time scale. One test function which I was investigating was the extreme version of this, the rectangle function, $f_{1} \left ( t \right ) = \left \{ \begin{matrix}  1 & |t| < a \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}  \end{matrix} \right.$ In other words, a function which is constant for some window, and zero everywhere else. However, I quickly realized this was not an allowed possibility for the function $f$, because it is the result of a Fourier transform which takes on negative values, $g_{1} \left ( \omega \right ) = \frac{\sin \left ( a \omega \right )}{\omega }$ (up to some possible factors of $2 \pi$ I admit I'm being lazy about). What I'm now trying to understand is to what extent I can quantify the notion of ""flatness"" of a function, and whether or not this is forbidden by being the Fourier transform of a positive function. For example, the Fermi-Dirac function, $f_{FD} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp[t - T]}$, (defined for $ t > 0$ and then symmetrized about the origin for our purposes), looks very ""flat"" for large values of T, having a broad plateau for small times, before later decaying exponentially to zero. For large values of T, the corresponding Fourier transform attains negative values. However, for small values of T, the curve decays more quickly, and there is a crossover point at which the Fourier transform appears to never be negative. I've concocted many other examples of functions (which I can elaborate on if need be) which seem to associate my intuitive sense of ""flatness"" with the necessary presence of negative values in the Fourier transform. I've tried to think of various ways to quantify this flatness (such as putting bounds on certain derivatives), but none of the metrics I've thought of seem to be sufficient. As far as I can tell from fiddling around in Mathematica, $f$ is allowed to decay very quickly, and is also allowed to oscillate very wildly, but staying somewhat stationary is not allowed. More subtle examples involve the fact that $\exp[-t^{2}]$ is allowed, while $\exp[-t^{4}]$, which has a little bit more of a flat ""depression"" at $t=0$, is not. Intuitively, I understand what's happening - the Fourier transform of a constant leads to a sinc function, and to the extent that a function ""looks flat,"" its transform will ""look like a sinc function,"" and attain negative values. It would be nice, however, to have some sort of quantitative result that involves these ideas I'm talking about. I've done some reading on auto-correlation functions and characteristic functions (since $g$ could be interpreted as a probability measure), but I haven't yet run across anything like this.

For $x_1, x_2 \in \Bbb{R}$ (where $x_1 \not= x_2$), if $d$ denotes the distance between these two points, then we can choose an open ball $U_1$ with radius $d/2$ around $x_1$ and an open ball $U_2$ again of radius $d/2$ around $x_2$. Obviously, these two open balls will not intersect at any point. So let $(x_1, x_2, ...), (x'_1, x'_2, ...) \in \Bbb{R^n}$. Then For each $x_i, x'_i \in \Bbb{R}$ (where $i \in \Bbb{N}$), there exist open balls $U_i$ and $U'_i$  in $\Bbb{R}$ around $x_i$ and $x'_i$, respectively, such that the open balls do not intersect. But then $(U_1 \times U_2 \times ...) \cap (U'_1 \times U'_2 \times ...) = \emptyset$. We can show that $\displaystyle\prod_{\Bbb{N}} \Bbb{R}$ is not metrizable by proving that it is not first countable. The first countability condition tells us that $\forall x \in X$ $\exists \{ U_n \}_{n\ \in \Bbb{N}} \subseteq  P(X)$ such that (i) $\forall n \in \Bbb{N}$, $U_n$ is a neighborhood of $x$. (ii) For every neighborhood $V$ of $x$ $\exists n \in \Bbb{N}$ such that $U_n \subseteq V$. So let's pick the point $(0,0,0,...) \in \displaystyle\prod_{\Bbb{N}} \Bbb{R}$. We know that, for all $n \in \Bbb{N}$ (in each $\Bbb{R}$) $(-1/n, 1/n)$ is a neighborhood of $0$. So $(\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})...$ is a neighborhood of $(0,0,0,0,...)$. But in order to have $U_n \in \{U_n\}_{n \in \Bbb{N}}$ such that $U_n \subseteq (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})...$ for all $n$, we know that the sequence $\{(\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})...\}_{n \in \Bbb{N}} = \{U_n\}_{n \in \Bbb{N}}$. But a sequences approaches infinity, and as $n \rightarrow \infty$ $(\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}) \times (\frac{-1}{n}, \frac{1}{n})... = \{0\} \times \{0\} \times ...$, which is a closed neighborhood of $(0,0,0,...)$, meaning that the 1st condition of first countability fails.

Secondly, if $D^{\alpha}u \in L^{p}(U)$ for $|\alpha| = k$ then how would you show that $D^{\alpha}u \in L^{p}(U)$ for $\alpha < k$? Thanks!","['weak-derivatives', 'functional-analysis', 'lp-spaces']"
547894,How to work out sinh^2(x),I just did a question where I had $sinh^2(x)$ I know this is simply $(sinh(x))^2$ however couldn't work out where the extra 2 came from when working out. $sinh(x) = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}$ so $sinh^2(x) = (\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2})^2$ which I figured = $\frac{e^xe^x-e^{-x}e^{-x}}{4}$ = $\frac{e^{2x}-e^{-2x}}{4}$ However I am told the answer = $\frac{e^{2x}-2+e^{-2x}}{4}$ And I don't know where the 2 came from,"['trigonometry', 'algebra-precalculus']"
547917,Changing an exponential function to logarithmic,"I have a question stating that $P=75e^{-0.005t}$ and they want to get t by itself. I used the example $y=2^x = x=log_2(y)$ To find that $-0.005t = 75ln(P)$ So $t=\frac{75ln(P)}{-0.005}$ However apparently this isn't correct. Can someone please show me where I went wrong (not so much another way of doing it, but what was wrong in the working I used) Thanks","['exponential-function', 'logarithms', 'algebra-precalculus']"

547966,"Finding a,b,c,d in a quartic expression","Let $p(x)=x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ where a,b,c,d are constants. If $p(1)=10$, $p(2)=20$, $p(3)=30$, compute $\frac {p(12)+p(-8)}{10}$. I have tried so far. 
\begin{align}
a+b+c+d=&9\\8a+4b+2c+d=&4\\27a+9b+3c+d=&-51

Manipulating these, I got $6a+b=-25$. Now, $$\frac {p(12)+p(-8)}{10}=\frac{24832+1216a+208b+4c+2d}{10}$$ $$=\frac{24832+202(6a+b)+(4a+4b+4c)+2b+2d}{10}$$ $$=\frac{19782+(36-4d)+2b+2d}{10}$$ $$=\frac{19818+2b-2d}{10}$$ How do I get rid of the $2b-2d$?",['algebra-precalculus']
547970,Proof for '$AB = I$ then $BA = I$' without Motivation?,"I have read this question page ( If $AB = I$ then $BA = I$ ) by Dilawar and saw that most of proofs are using the fact that the algebra of matrices and linear operators are isomorphic. But from a simple view, matrix is only an structured set of scalars, and the fact that the dot product of the i-th row of $A$ and the j-th column of $B$ equals to the Kronecker delta is just a componentwise algebraic informarion. Then I started to wonder if there's any ""brutal"" proof that does not visit the ""higher"" domain of algebraic structures and just uses the simple componentwise algebraic operations to prove that  the dot product of the i-th row of $B$ and the j-th column of $A$ equals to the Kronecker delta from the given condition. (Proof that even a ""machine"" can do) Should we think a matrix as more than a mere 'number box' to show $BA=I$?","['linear-algebra', 'soft-question']"
548026,How can be a set of partial isomorphisms defined from a n-back-and-forth system?,"While studying partial Ebbinghaus-Flum's Mathematical Logic, I came across the partial isomorphism definition, as build upon an $n$-back-and-forth system. Consequently, the question I raise in the title. Now I quote from the textbook: «$\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are said to be finitely isomorphic, written $\mathfrak{A}\cong_{f}\mathfrak{B}$, iff there is a sequence $\left(I_{n}\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ with the following properties: • Every $I_{n}$ is a nonempty set of partial isomorphism form $\mathfrak{A}$ to $\mathfrak{B}$. • (Forth property) For every $p\in I_{n+1}$ and $a\in A$, there is $q\in I_{n}$ s.t. $\left(q\supset p\right)$ and $a\in dom\left(q\right)$. • (Back property) For every $p\in I_{n+1}$ and $b\in B$, there is $q\in I_{n}$ s.t. $\left(q\supset p\right)$ e $b\in rg\left(q\right)$.» This definition entails the following one (I quote again): «$\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are said to be partially isomorphic, written $\mathfrak{A}\cong_{p}\mathfrak{B}$, iff there is a sequence I such that: • $I$ is a nonempty set of partial isomorphisms form $\mathfrak{A}$ to $\mathfrak{B}$. • (Forth property) For every $p\in I$ and $a\in A$, there is $q\in I$ s.t. $\left(q\supset p\right)$ and $a\in dom\left(q\right)$. • (Back property) For every $p\in I$ and $b\in B$, there is $q\in I$ s.t. $\left(q\supset p\right)$ e $b\in rg\left(q\right)$.» As far as I can understand, it is a matter of cardinality: two structures $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ may be uncountable, and yet be partially isomorphic (i.e. countable isomorphic), and in this case I is the set of all partial isomorphisms from $\mathfrak{A}$ to $\mathfrak{B}$; while the chain $\left(I_{n}\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ indicates the precise $n\in\mathbb{N}$ for which extensions are allowed.
However, even if my take on this is correct, I still feel uncomfortable considering the set $I$ as a single set of extended maps. Thank you in advance for your help.","['logic', 'model-theory', 'functions']"
