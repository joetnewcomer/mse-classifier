1708547,"The definition of orientation of a manifold from Spivak, Calculus on Manifolds","In Spivak Calculus on Manifolds the author uses a definition of orientation of a manifold which I do not understand, and which I do not found elsewhere. I cite: It is often necessary to choose an orientation $\mu_x$ for each tangent space $M_x$ of a manifold $M$. Such choices are called consistent provided that for every coordinate system $f : W \to \mathbb R^n$ and $a, b \in W$ the relation
  $$
 [f_{\ast}((e_1)_a), \ldots, f_{\ast}((e_k))_a] = \mu_{f(a)}
$$
  holds if and only if
  $$
 [f_{\ast}((e_1)_b), \ldots, f_{\ast}((e_k)_b)] = \mu_{f(b)}.
$$ For the notation. With $v_p$ he denotes the tangent vector $v$ at the point $p$, for a function $f : A \to \mathbb R^m$ with $A \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ differentiable on $A$ we have $f_{\ast}(v_p) := (Df(p)(v))_{f(p)}$ and for a basis $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ he denotes by $[v_1, \ldots, v_n]$ the orientation of $v_1, \ldots, v_n$. Also a coordinate system is defined as: A subset $M$ of $\mathbb R^n$ is a $k$-dimensional manifold if and only if for each point $x \in M$ the following ''coordinate condition'' is satisfied: (C) There is an open set $U$ containting $x$, an open set $W \subseteq R^k$, and a $1-1$ differentiable function $f : W \to \mathbb R^n$ such that (1) $f(W) = M \cap U$, (2) $f'(y)$ has rank $k$ for each $y \in W$, (3) $f^{-1} : f(W) \to W$ is continuous. Such a function $f$ is called a coordinate system around $x$. Now my question, I totally do not understand his definition of orientability of a manifold. If I got him right he requires that we find a number $\mu_x$ for each point $x$ on the manifold, which fulfills a compatibility condition for every coordinate system. As $\det Df(p) \ne 0$ for each $p \in W$, I see that this determinant could not switch sign, but otherwise it could vary continuously. So it does not make sense to have a numbers $\mu_x$ and require the above condition for all coordinate systems, as by composition with diffeomorphisms we can change the coordinate system and take care that the determinant might have different values (despite still having all the same sign). So this might be an error and instead ''for all coordinate'' systems, he means ''for each $x$ there exists a coordinate system such that'' (i.e. we have an atlas whose transition maps have determinants with the same sign, which is closer to other definitions I found). Another possiblity is how $[\cdot,\cdots,\cdot]$ is precisely defined, as he just wrote it denotes the orientation (or equivalence class), but such an class is not a number, its a set of ordered bases, but could be represented by a number, so $[\cdot,\cdots,\cdot] \in \mathbb R$, but maybe we have $[\cdot,\cdots,\cdot]\in\{-1,1\}$ which would make some more sense. Other definitions I found are that the existence of a $n$-form $\omega$ on $M$ is asserted such that $\omega(p)$ is strictly positive on the tangent space at $p$, or that we could find an atlas such that the transition maps have positive determinant, or the definitions from here which I hardly understand.","['differential-topology', 'manifolds', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'analysis']"
1708555,How is the mode of an exponential distribution zero?,"The exponential distribution has a mode of $0$, which, according to Wikipedia , means that $0$ ""is the value that is most likely to be sampled"". This is not what I would expect, given that the exponential distribution ""describes the time between events in a Poisson process"". So, say me getting phone calls is a Poisson process and I get a call every hour on average. How is it that $0$ is the most likely sample? My intuition tells me that $0$ is one of the most unlikely samples, or at least much less likely than some number around $1$ hour.","['exponential-distribution', 'probability', 'probability-distributions']"
1708595,Root test is stronger than ratio test?

I am a little bit confused regarding the meaning of the phrase :"" Root test is stronger than ratio test"", and was hoping you will be able to help me figure it out. As far as I can see here: https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/0025570x33450.di021200.02p0190s.pdf The limit from the ratio test is greater or equal the limit from the root test . So, my first question is-  is there any example of a series $\Sigma a_n$ such that the limit from the ratio test is exactly 1 (i.e.- inconclusive), but the limit from the root test is less than 1? (i.e.- convergence can be proved by using the root test but not by using the ratio test )
If not, then is it correct that this phrase is the meaning of ""stronger"" is when the limit from the ratio test does not exist? (as in the classic example of a rearranged geometric series) Hope you will be able to help.

1708691,Multivariate distribution with the same kurtosis as normal distribution,"Good morning. I am writing a thesis about testing multivariate normality. I would like to do a comparison of power of some tests against given alternatives based on Monte Carlo simulations. I have a following problem: Some multivariate normality tests are based on multivariate skewness $\beta_{1,k}$ and multivariate kurtosis $\beta_{2,k}$ defined by Mardia this way: \begin{equation*}
\beta_{1,k}(\mathbf{X}) := E [ \left\{ (\mathbf{X} - \boldsymbol \mu)^{T} \boldsymbol \Sigma^{-1} (\mathbf{Y} - \boldsymbol \mu) \right\}^{3} ], 
\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
\beta_{2,k}(\mathbf{X}) := E [ \left\{ (\mathbf{X} - \boldsymbol \mu)^{T} \boldsymbol \Sigma^{-1} (\mathbf{X} - \boldsymbol \mu) \right\}^{2} ]
\end{equation*}
for iid. random vectors $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$. It is widely known that for $k$-dimensional normal distribution holds $\beta_{1,k} = 0$ and $\beta_{2,k} = k(k + 2)$. There are some studies that compare power of normality test against alternatives with $\beta_{1,k} = 0$ but $\beta_{2,k} \neq k(k + 2)$ (such as Students $t$ distribution). I would like to do it in the opposite direction and compare power of my normality tests against alternative with $\beta_{1,k} \neq 0$ but $\beta_{2,k} = k(k + 2)$.
My problem is that I am unable to find such a distribution. Could anybody tell me, how to generate sample from multivariate distribution with $\beta_{1,k} \neq 0$ but $\beta_{2,k} = k(k + 2)$ in $R$ programme? I will be grateful for all useful ideas. I tried to solve my problem by using bivariate Skew-Normal Distribution from package $sn$ but it is probably not possible for this distribution (with parametrization from $sn$ package) to have $\beta_{1,k} \neq 0$ but $\beta_{2,k} = k(k + 2)$.

1708735,A spiralling sequence based on integer divisors. Has anyone noticed this before?,"Firstly, please excuse the informal style of my explanation, as I am not a mathematician, although I am aware that this can be explained in more formal terms. I have mapped integers to points on a circle on the complex plane in the following way:
$$
a_n=\prod _{j=1}^n (-1)^{2 (n \bmod j)/j}
$$ 
I then took a sequence of partial sums of $a_n$:
$$
b_n=\sum _{j=1}^n a_j
$$
I think of it as a path made of vectors of length 1 on the complex plane. I then plotted $b_n$, and I saw this beautiful vine-like shape: (for $n <= 45000$) (for $n <= 1000$) The path goes clockwise, then the spin accelerates until it turns anticlockwise and moves somewhere else. In order to find out more about the ""whirlpools"" and ""peak flows"", I checked the differences between consecutive terms of $a_n$, and obtained the following plot: The minima/""peak flows"" fall at $n = 1, 4, 11, 30, 83, 226, ...$, which appears to correspond to http://oeis.org/A078141 , and to be given by $$\left\lfloor e^{n-\gamma }\right\rfloor$$ I have checked that the ""whirlpools"" appear to correspond to $$\left\lfloor e^{n - \gamma + 1/2}\right\rfloor$$ I think this would mean that each branch of the vine is $e$ times larger than the previous one in some way... As for the position of the ""peak flows"" on the complex plane, they are:

Here is a plot of the absolute values of $b_n$: Here is an array plot of distances between terms of $a_n$, for $n <= 100$, just for fun, really: I have a bunch of questions: As per title. Is this something that has been noticed before? Why do the ""whirlpools"" fall where they do on the complex plane? What is special about those values? Is every term of $a_n$ unique? If so, is it possible that there exists a way of learning something about the divisors of $n$ from $a_n$ or $b_n$?","['complex-numbers', 'divisibility', 'roots-of-unity', 'prime-numbers', 'sequences-and-series']"

1708763,"Question on the definition of outward normal vector from Spivak, Calculus on Manifolds","The following definition of the outward unit normal at the boundary of a manifold $M \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ is taken from Spivak, Calculus on manifolds (page 119). If $M$ is a $k$-dimensional manifold-with-boundary and $x \in \partial M$, then $(\partial M)_x$ is a $(k-1)$-dimensional subspace of the $k$-dimensional vector space $M_x$. Thus there are exactly two unit vectors in $M_x$ which are perpendicular to $(\partial M)_x$; they can be distinguished as follows: If $f : W \to \mathbb R^n$ is a coordinate system with $W \subseteq H^k$ and $f(0) = x$, then only one of these vectors is $f_{\ast}(v_0)$ for some $v_0$ with $v^k < 0$. This unit vector is called the outward unit vector . What wonders me is how a coordinate system is defined according to the book. If $M \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ is $k$-dimensional manifold, then for each $x \in M$ there exists an open set $U$ containing $x$, an open set $W \subseteq \mathbb R^k$, and a 1-1 differentiable function $f : W \to \mathbb R^n$ such that (1) $f(W) = M \cap U$ (2) $f'(y)$ has rank $k$ for each $y \in W$, (3) $f^{-1} : f(W) \to W$ is continuous. This $f : W \to \mathbb R^n$ is called a coordinate system . As $H^k := \{ x \in \mathbb R^k : x^k \ge 0 \}$ is not open, if $W \subseteq H^k$ and $x \in \partial M$, then as $W$ does not touches the boundardy of $H^k$ (i.e those points $x$ with $x^k = 0$) the condition $f(0) = x$ implies $0 \notin W$ and so $x \notin M \cap U$. But by the requirement $x \in U$. So this gives a contradiction? Have I understood something wrong here? I guess this might be an error in the book, and I think to fix it the definition of a coordinate system $f : W \to \mathbb R^n$ must be altered to account for boundary points, i.e. I guess what would work is if $x$ is not a boundary point, then the conditions are as above, and if $x \in \partial M$ to alter (1) to (1') $f(W \cap H^k) = M \cap U$ (guess the others could also be restricted to $W \cap H^k$, but I guess leaving them would also be fine). But after this alteration the assertion ''$W \subseteq H^k$'' has to be dropped or we would still get the same contradictions for $W$ open in $\mathbb R^k$. So am I right in my objections? And how would you fix it?","['differential-topology', 'manifolds', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'analysis']"

1708791,Part of proof of Prime Number Theorem,"If $x\ge 1$, let $\pi(x) = \sum_{p\le x} 1$ denote the number of primes $\le x$. The prime number theorem states that $\pi(x) \sim {x\over \log(x)}$ This is usually proved by studying the related function $\theta (x)=\sum_{p\le x} \log (p)$. I want to show that the prime number theorem is equivalent to the relation $\theta(x) \sim x$. I already derived the following equation: 
$$\theta(x)= \pi(x)\log(x)-\int_{x}^2 {\pi(t)\over t}dt $$
$$\pi(x)={\theta(x)\over \log(x)} + \int_{x}^2 {\theta(t)\over {t \log^2t}}dt$$
It is also known that $\theta(x) \sim x$, i.e. $\lim_{x\to \infty}{ {\theta(x)\over x}}=1$, and $$\int_{x}^2{1\over \log(y)} dy={x\over \log(x)} + o({x\over \log(x)})$$ I also derived: $$\int_{x}^2{1\over \log^2(y)}dy = \textrm{Li}(x) - {x\over \log(x)} + {2\over \log(2)}$$, where $Li(x) = \int_{x}^2 {dt\over \log(t)}$, $o$ is the Hardy's little o notation.

1708847,Do we have $\int f dxdy = \int fdydx$ or $\int f dxdy = -\int f dydx$?,"If $f : \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R$ is an integrable function, then do we have
$$
 \int f dxdy = \int f dydx
$$
or
$$
 \int f dxdy = -\int f dydx?
$$
(I am leaving the domain of integration as it does not matter for the question, but suppose we have some compactum $[a,b]\times[c,d]$ as this make integration theory easier). To give some context. I am currently reading about differential forms and integration, and if we have a $2$-form $\omega = f\cdot (dx \wedge dy)$, then
$$
 \int f dx\wedge dy = -\int f dy \wedge dx
$$
and the notation $\int f dx \wedge dy$ could be understood as shorthand for $\int f dxdy$. So then the second interpretation would be true. On the other side, the ""ordinary"" integral as interpreted as the Riemann-integral where $dx$ and $dy$ are sometimes understood as the ""infinitesimal"" sides of the rectangles in which the domain of integrations gets partitioned. But then $dxdy = dydx$, or $\Delta x \cdot \Delta y = \Delta y \cdot \Delta x$. I know this language is a little bit ""hand-wavy"" as it is not clear what infinitesimal objects are, and so some authors leave them out of the integral expression and just write $\int f$, but at least this is the intuitive way and in some way resembles what is done in Riemann integration. Also, another argument in favour of the first (i.e. interchanging does not changes sign) is the Fubini theorem and multiple integrals (see wikipedia ), i.e. if Fubini applies we have
$$
 \int f dxdy = \int \left(\int f dx\right) dy
$$
and 
$$
 \int \left(\int f dx \right) dy = \int \left(\int f dy\right) dx
$$
which would yield $\int f dxdy = \int f dydx$ by comparing those expressions. So there are arguments to support both interpretations, but what is the right interpretation?","['differential-forms', 'integration', 'infinitesimals', 'differential-geometry', 'analysis']"

(based it off an example that was different but also slightly similar) In a league with two divisions of 11 teams each there is no schedule with each team playing a game with each team in each division. In the language of graph theory, the scheduled games can be viewed as edges with 11 vertices. We are asking for a graph that is regular of degree 11, but we are also asking for the subgraph induced by the 11 teams in one division to be regular of degree 1. Since 1 and 11 are both odd, this is impossible, because every graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree.

1709100,"On the definition of the volume form in general vector spaces as given in Spivak, Calculus on Manifolds","For a vector space $V$ denote by $\Lambda^k(V)$ the space of alternating $k$-tensors, or alternating $k$-fold multilinear maps on $V$. I have some difficulty following the intention of the author in the part where he introduced the volume form of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ (page 83): The fact that $\dim \Lambda^n(\mathbb R^n) = 1$ is probably not new to you, since $\det$ is often defined as the unique element $\omega \in \Lambda^n(\mathbb R^n)$ such that $\omega(e_1, \ldots, e_n) = 1$. For a general vector space $V$ there is no extra criterion of this sort to distinguish a particular $\omega \in \Lambda^n(V)$. Suppose, however, that an inner product $T$ for $V$ is given. If $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ and $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ are two bases which are orthonormal with respect to $T$, and the matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ is defined by $w_i = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} v_j$, then
  $$
 \delta_{ij} = T(w_i, w_j) = \sum_{k,l = 1}^n a_{ik}a_{jl} T(v_k, v_j) = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}a_{jk}.
$$
  In other words, if $A^T$ denotes the transpose of the matrix $A$, then we have $A \cdot A^T = I$, so $\det A = \pm 1$. It folows as $\omega(w_1,\ldots, w_n) = \det(A)\cdot \omega(v_1, \ldots, v_n)$ that if $\omega \in \Lambda^n(V)$ satisfies $\omega(v_1, \ldots, v_n) \in \{-1,1\}$, then $\omega(w_1, \ldots, w_n) \in \{-1,1\}$. If an orientation $\mu$ for $V$ has also been given, it follows that there is a unique $\omega \in \Lambda^n(V)$ such that $\omega(v_1, \ldots, v_n) = 1$ whenever $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ is an orthonormal basis such that $[v_1,\ldots, v_n] = \mu$. This unique $\omega$ is called the volume element of $V$. First why he claims that for a general (finite-dimensional) $V$ there is no extra criterion as for $\mathbb R^n$; if we choose some basis $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ of $V$ then the requirement $\omega(v_1, \ldots, v_n) = 1$ gives me a unique $n$-form (as the value on every permutation of the basis vectors is then also prescribed). Of course, this choice is relative to a basis, but that was the choice in $\mathbb R^n$ also. And the orientation is coded in the basis. So why all these complicated derivations using the given orientation and an inner product, when simply a basis is enough? Also if we have a basis of a finite-dimensional vector space, we also get an inner product by multiplying the coefficient w.r.t. this basis and summing. Of course the geometric meaning of such an inner product is questionable, as it no longer corresponds to angles, length and projections as in the $\mathbb R^n$ setting with the standard inner product if the $v_i$ are not orthonormal. But for mere existence of an inner product such that the basis is orthonormal w.r.t. it, it is enough. I can image that such definitions are not very meaningful from a geometrical point of view, if we take an arbitrary basis then built our volume form by the mere requirement that it takes the value one on this basis, we have no ready-to-use interpretation of it as an actual volume, as for it we need orthonormality and a notion of length, angle and so on already given by a prescribed inner product. (of course by the above construction of inner product an angle of two vectors w.r.t. to this constructed inner product corresponds to the ""real"" geometric angle if we view the coordinates as coordinates of the standard basis in $\mathbb R^n$). So I guess that what he might want to say is ""there is no sort to distinguish any particular form that has also any meaningful geometrical interpretation, as for example given by some inner product and orientation, after which we can talk about (oriented) length, areas, volumes"". But this is just a guess of mine; as how we are interested in ""real world interpretations"" in formal mathematics and its definition is here not clear to me. Maybe what he want to say is that the essential ingredients for a volume form (as derived from $\mathbb R^3$ and its interpretation of volume) is that we need an orthonormal basis (hence an inner product), which also fixes an orientation, such that a meaningful volume form could be introduced.","['differential-forms', 'differential-geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"

However, unlike the exponential function, this one is very elusive - I can't find any other representation for it - no integral, no differential equation, nothing. Its derivatives exist (an infinite number of them), but it seems they can't be connected to the function itself in any other way. I know that $s(1)-1$ is called 'Sophomore's Dream', because it has integral representation: $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^k}=\int_0^1 \frac{1}{t^t}dt$$ I don't know if the same method can be used to find a general integral representation for $s(x)$, but I have some hope. The most interesting (in my opinion) property of this function - $s(x)$ and its derivatives all have exactly one zero (for $x_0<0$) and one minimum ($x_m<0$ and $s(x_m)<0$). They are connected in a sense, since obviously if $s(x)$ has a minimum, then $s'(x)$ has a zero. Here is a plot of $s(x)$ for $x<0$: I added $1$ to the sum in the definition of $s(x)$ for consistency - it can be seen from the form of its derivatives: $$s(x)=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2^2}+\frac{x^3}{3^3}+\dots=1+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{k^k}$$ $$s'(x)=1+\frac{x}{2}+\frac{x^2}{9}+\frac{x^3}{64}+\dots=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k~x^{k-1}}{k^k}$$ $$s''(x)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2x}{9}+\frac{3x^2}{64}+\frac{4x^3}{625}+\dots=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k(k-1)~x^{k-2}}{k^k}$$ $$s'''(x)=\frac{2}{9}+\frac{3x}{32}+\frac{12x^2}{625}+\frac{5x^3}{1944}+\dots=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k(k-1)(k-2)~x^{k-3}}{k^k}$$ It is apparent, that $\lim_{n \to \infty} s^{(n)}(0) = 0$, however, the zero on the negative line actually moves to the left with each differentiation (see the position of the minimum). So I'm not sure, how the 'infinite derivative' of $s(x)$ would look. I'd like to know if someone studied this function, and get a reference for it. But the main question is - what other definitions are possible for $s(x)$, except for the series? Thanks to this great answer , I'm able to write the integral definition: $$s(x)=1+\int_0^1 x ~u^{-u~x} du$$ So I consider my question answered. By the way, if we define the function: $$p(x)=\frac{s(x)-1}{x}=\int_0^1 u^{-u~x} du=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{k-1}}{k^k}$$ We get a very monotone (exponential-like) behavior, without any zeroes or minima.

It is known that in an irreducible nodal curve each node reduces the arithmetic genus by one: if $\tilde{C} \rightarrow C$ is the normalization of $C$, and $C$ is nodal with $n$ nodes, then $p_a(\tilde{C})=p_a(C)-n$. I am using the word reduce because I am mainly thinking of a plane curve: if it has degree $d$ and it is smooth, then it has genus
\begin{equation}
p_g=p_a=\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2},
\end{equation} 
while if it is nodal with $n$ nodes, the genus of the normalization is 
\begin{equation}
p_g=p_a=\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}-n.
\end{equation} The above statement can be proved thinking of our irreducible nodal curve $C$ as being in some smooth surface $S$, using adjunction formula on $S$ and on its blow up at the nodes of $C$. My question is the following. Can we show this fact using the topological Euler characteristic? Does the topological Euler characteristic make sense if $C$ is singular, and is it still equal to $2(1-p_a(C))$? Edit: PVAL's comment shows that the above thing does not work for reducible curves. If we take as definition of $p_a$ the one given in Hartshorne (chapter 3, section 5, exercises), then $p_a(C)=h^1(\mathcal{O}_C)$ for a reducible curve too. If we consider $C=L_1 \cup L_2 \subset \mathbb{P}^2$, then we have $h^1(\mathcal{O}_{L_1\cup L_2})=0$ from the long exact sequence in cohomology of $0 \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}(-2)\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{L_1 \cup L_2}\rightarrow 0$. On the other hand, $\chi_{top}(L_1 \cup L_2)=3 \neq 2 (1-0)$.","['riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'singularity-theory', 'algebraic-topology']"
1709530,Volume of a hypersurface in flat families?,"Suppose that $X_t$ is the vanishing of $x^2 + y^2 + t z^2 = 0$ in $\mathbb{CP}^2$. For $t \not = 0$, this is a submanifold, and it inherits a Riemannian metric from the Fubini-Studi metric on $\mathbb{CP}^2$. So one can compute its volume. Similarly, for $t = 0$, it is a.e. a manifold, and one can also compute its volume. Question: Is the surface area of $X_0$ equal to the surface area of $X_1$? Note in particular that all of the $X_t$, for $t \not = 0$, are projectively equivalent, so if the surface area was an invariant that was stable (or at least varied smoothly) in families like this, then the answer is yes. (To keep the habit of citing my sources fairly, even if both of us are anonymous people from your point of view, I posed the secret question below to a friend and she suggested looking at this family. Neither of us are complex geometers though, so we couldn't tell if this would work.) (Secret question: I really want to know if the volume of a degree d curve is d times the volume of a linear hypersurface.)

1709563,Does every nonempty well-ordered set have a least element?,"I was making my way through The Art of Computer Programming , when some words got me puzzled. Here is how the book describes the principle of well-ordering : Let ""$\prec$"" be a relation on set $S$, satisfying the following properties: Given $x$, $y$ and $z$ in $S$, if $ x \prec y$ and $y \prec z$, then $x \prec z$. Given $x$ and $y$ in $S$, exactly one of the following three possibilities is true: $x \prec y$, $x = y$, or $y \prec x$. If $A$ is any nonempty subset of $S$, there is an element $x$ in $A$ with $x \preceq y$ for all $y$ in $A$. This relation is said to be a well-ordering of $S$. Set theory is definitely not my strength suit, but this seems plain wrong to me. Let $S \leftarrow \mathbb{Z}$ and $A \leftarrow S$. Consider the ""less than"" ($\lt$) relation. It is transitive $(1)$, and trichotomous $(2)$; it also supports $(3)$ since there will always be some element $x \mid x \le y$. The set hold for all three assertions, thus it should be well-ordered.

1709609,Probability of rolling dice twice,"Did I calculate the correct probability for these simple scenarios: 1: What is the probability of rolling 3 and 4 with two dice in two rolls? If you roll either 3 or 4 in the first roll, you put that die aside and roll the second die again. I would break the probability down like this: 1/18 chance of getting both 3 and 4 (or 4 and 3) in the first roll. 1/4 chance of rolling 3 (31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 13, 23, 53 and 63), and then 1/6 chance of rolling the 4 in the second roll. 1/4 chance of rolling 4 (41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 14, 24, 54 and 64), and then 1/6 chance of rolling the 3 in the second roll. 1/18 of rolling both 3 and 4 on the second roll (having rolled neither in the first). This adds up to: $$\frac{1}{18} + (\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{6}) + (\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{6}) + \frac{1}{18} = \frac{7}{36}$$ Is that correct? 2: What is the probability of rolling double 6 in two rolls? Slightly different breakdown: 1/36 chance of getting 66 in the first roll. 10/36 chance of getting a single 6 (all combinations of 6, except 66), then 1/6 of getting the second 6 in the second roll. 1/36 chance of getting 66 in the second roll. $$\frac{1}{36} + (\frac{5}{18} \times \frac{1}{6}) + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{11}{108}$$ Correct?

1709618,Verifying Stokes' Theorem on an example,"Let $M = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 | x^2+y^2+z^2=1,z>0\}$, and let $\omega = xdy$. I would like to verify that $\int_M d\omega = \int_C \omega$, where $C = \partial M$ given by $C = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 | x^2+y^2 = 1, z=0\}$. I first parametrize $M$ as the image of the set $A = \{(\theta, \phi) \in \mathbb{R}^2 | -\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}, 0 < \phi < 2\pi\}$ under the spherical transformation $\alpha(\theta, \phi) = (\sin\theta\cos\phi, \sin\theta\sin\phi, \cos\theta)$. So we have that,
$$\int_M d\omega = \int_M dx \wedge dy = \int_A \alpha^* (dx \wedge dy) = \int_A d\alpha_1 \wedge d\alpha_2.$$
Since $$d\alpha_1 = \cos\theta\cos\phi \ d\theta - \sin\theta\sin\phi \ d\phi,$$
and $$d\alpha_2 = \cos\theta\sin\phi \ d\theta + \sin\theta\cos\phi \ d\phi,$$
$d\alpha_1 \wedge d\alpha_2 = \sin\theta\cos^2\phi \ d\theta \wedge d\phi - \sin\theta\cos\theta\sin^2 \phi \ d\phi \wedge d\theta = \sin\theta\cos\theta \ d\theta \wedge d\phi$, so the integral becomes
$$\int_A \sin\theta \cos\theta \ d\theta \wedge d\phi = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{-\pi / 2}^{\pi / 2} \sin\theta \cos \theta \ d\theta d\phi = 0.$$ On the other hand, we can parametrize $C$ as the image of $U = \{\theta \in \mathbb{R} | 0 < \theta < 2\pi \}$ under $\gamma(\theta) = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$. Then
$$\int_C \omega = \int_C xdy = \int_U \gamma^*(xdy) = \int_U \cos\theta \ d\gamma_2 = \int_U \cos^2\theta \ d\theta = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1+\cos2\theta}{2} \ d\theta = \pi.$$ Why do my answers not agree?","['multivariable-calculus', 'differential-forms', 'stokes-theorem', 'differential-geometry']"
1709639,What is Complex Analysis? Why is it accompanied by Linear Algebra?,"I hope this doesn't extend to a lengthy question. I studied Linear Algebra recently in my first term at university.

1709673,Is there a notion of a complex derivative or complex integral?,"While reading about fractional calculus in http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0110241.pdf , I came across the following quote: Fractional integration and fractional differentiation are generalisations of notions of integer-order integration and differentiation, and include n-th derivatives and n-folded integrals (n denotes an integer number) as particular cases. Let $D = \frac{d}{dx}$ . We have found meaningful notions of $D^2$ and $D^{-1}$ (derivative and antiderivative, respectively, of integer-order) and $D^{\frac{1}{2}}$ (derivative of fractional-order) , and we can say that integer differentiation (where given $D^n , n \in \mathbb{Z}$) is a special case of more general fractional differentiation (where given $D^n , n \in \mathbb{R}$). I'm wondering if there's some meaningful notion of ""complex differentiation"", say something like $D^i$, where fractional differentiation is a special case (note that anti differentiation is a special case of differentiation; namely, given $D^n$, anti differentiation occurs when $n$ is real and negative).

1709995,"Verification : Prove the Fubini-Tonelli theorem when $(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ is any measure space and $Y$ is a countable set with the counting measure.","The Fubini-Tonelli theorem is valid when $(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ is an arbitrary measure space and $Y$ is a countable set $\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{P}(Y)$, and $\nu$ is counting measure on $Y$. This is an exercise from Folland. I tried to prove this as in the proof of the original theorem, but as you can see below, the proof of the Tonelli theorem uses Theorem 2.36, which in turn requires the $\sigma-$finiteness of both measures. So how can I prove this? I would greatly appreciate any help. Edit : I came up with a solution below but need it verified. My Attempt For convenience, let $Y=\mathbb{N}$, and let $Y$ be the union of $Y_n=\{1,\dots, n\}$. Let $f\in L^{+}(X \times Y)$. Let $f_n=f\chi_{X\times Y_n}$. Then clearly $f_n$ is an increasing sequence converging to $f$, so we can use the Monotone Convergence Theorem later. Now we have: $\int f_n d(\mu \times \nu)=\sum_{y=1}^n\int_{X\times y} f d(\mu \times \nu)=\sum_{y=1}^n\int_X f_n (x,y) d\mu(x)$. $g_n(x)=\int f{_n}(x,y)d\nu(y)=\sum_{y=1}^n f_n(x,y)$. $h_n(y)=\int f_n(x,y)d\mu(x)$. $\int g_n(x) d\mu(x)=\int \sum_{y=1}^n f_n(x,y)d\mu=\sum_{y=1}^n \int_X f_n(x,y) d\mu(x)$. $\int h_n(y) d\nu(y)=\sum_{y=1}^n \int_X f_n(x,y) d\mu(x)$. Also, $\lim_n g_n(x)=\lim_n \sum_{y=1}^n f_n(x,y)=\lim_n \sum_{y=1}^n f(x,y)\cdot  \chi_{X\times Y_n}=\sum_{y=1}^\infty f(x,y)$. and $\lim_n h_n(y)=\lim \int_X f_n(x,y) d\mu(x)=\int_X \lim f_n(x,y) d\mu(x)=\int_X f(x,y) d\mu(x)$ by the Monotone Convergence Theorem. So the three integrals are equal, and now we can apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem and the rest of the proof is identical to the one given below.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'analysis', 'proof-verification']"
1710055,Holomorphy of a function with values in a Hilbert space,"Denote by $\mathbb C^\infty $ the Hilbert space $\ell^2(\mathbb C)$. Fix $1\leq N,M \leq \infty$, and let $U$ be an open subset of $\mathbb C^N $. Following Mujica's book ""complex analysis in Banach spaces"", a function $f:U\to \mathbb C ^M $ is called $holomorphic$ if for every $p \in U$ there is a bounded linear map $A:\mathbb C^N \to \mathbb C^M$ such that $\displaystyle \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{||f(p+h)-f(p)-Ah||}{||h||}=0$. In Mujica's book, theorem 8.12 says that a function $f:U\to \mathbb C^M $ is holomorphic if and only if, for every bounded linear map $\psi : \mathbb C^M \to \mathbb C$, the function $\psi \circ f$ is holomorphic. Denote $\pi^j:\mathbb C^M \to \mathbb C$ the map that to every $z\in \mathbb C^M$ associates its $j$-th component. Then $\pi^j $ is a bounded linear map, so Mujica's theorem implies that if $f$ is holomorphic then $f^j := \pi^j \circ f$ is holomorphic for every $j$. My question is: is the converse true? I.e. is it true that if every $f^j$ is holomorphic then $f$ is holomorphic? The answer is obviously yes if $M$ is finite. I think that, if $f$ is continuous, then the answer is yes also in the infinite-dimensional case. Can we drop the continuity hypotesis? Thank you. EDIT: I add my proof of the fact that it suffices to assume $f$ continuous. So, let $f:U\to \mathbb C^\infty$ (with $U\subseteq \mathbb C^N$ and $N\leq \infty$) continuous such that, for every $j$, $f^j$ is holomorphic. Let $\psi:\mathbb C^\infty \to \mathbb C$ be a bounded linear map: then $\psi$ acts like $z\mapsto <z,u>$ for some $u\in \mathbb C^\infty$, so $f$ is holomorphic if and only if the map $z\mapsto <f(z),u> $ from $U$ to $\mathbb C$ is holomorphic for every $u\in \mathbb C^\infty$. Now, select $u\in \mathbb c^\infty$ and denote $g_n (z) = \sum _{j=1}^{n} f^j (z) \overline u^j $ and $g=\lim_n g_n $: since every $g_n $ is holomorphic because every $f^j$ is, it suffices to prove that $g_n \to g$ uniformly on compact subsets. But, if $K$ is a compact of $U$, then $\|g_n (z) -g(z)\|\leq \|<f(z),u^{>n}>\|\leq \|f(z)\|\|u^{>n}\|\leq R_K \|u^{>n}\|$ for $z\in K$, where $u^{>n}$ is the vector of $\mathbb C^\infty$ with $j$-th component equal to $0$ if $j\leq n$, and equal to $u^j$ if $j>n$, and $R_K$ is a positive constant that bounds $\|f\|$ on $K$. Since $\|u^{>n}\|\to 0$ for $n\to \infty$, by generality of $u$, we have the thesis. EDIT2: following this question , I found a counterexample in the case $N=\infty$ and $M=\infty$. Define $f:\mathbb C^\infty \to \mathbb C^\infty$ by setting $f^1 (z) = z^1$; $f^2 (z) = f^3 (z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} (z^2 + z^3)$; $f^4 (z) = f^5 (z) = f^6 (z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt 3} (z^4 + z^5 + z^6)$; and so on. Then the Jacobian matrix of $f$ is the one given in this example , and does not represent a bounded linear operator. However, the question still remains unanswered for finite $N$ and infinite $M$.","['functional-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'hilbert-spaces']"

1710146,Confusion over the definition of a volume element,"I'm fairly new to differential geometry (currently self-teaching) and I'm a bit confused over the definition of a volume form. I've read that, given an $m$-dimensional manifold, a top-form $\omega\in\Omega^{m}(M)$ is an $m$-dimensional differential form that in a local coordinate chart $(U,\phi)$, $\phi (p)=x$, is given by $$\omega =f(x)dx^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{m}$$ and according to some texts that I've read, this can be used as a volume form. This is the first point I'm unsure about; how is this related to the notion of a volume element in ""ordinary"" integral calculus in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (i.e. $dV=f(x^{1},\ldots,x^{n})dx^{1}\cdots dx^{n}$), is there simply some correspondence of the form $$f(x)dx^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{m}\leftrightarrow f(x)dx^{1}\cdots dx^{m}$$
Does this also carry over for a change of coordinates in which the volume element changes by the absolute value of the Jacobian (determinant), $J$? That is, given two coordinate systems $(x^{1},\ldots,x^{n})$ and $(y^{1},\ldots, y^{n})$, it follows that in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $$f(x)dx^{1}\cdots dx^{m}=f(x(y))\lvert J\rvert dy^{1}\cdots dy^{n}$$ where $J=\text{det}\left(\frac{\partial x^{i}}{\partial y^{j}}\right)$. Is there a similar correspondence, $$f(x)dx^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{m}=f(x(y))\lvert\text{det}\left(\frac{\partial x^{\mu}}{\partial y^{\nu}}\right)\rvert dy^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dy^{m}\leftrightarrow f(x(y))\lvert J\rvert dy^{1}\cdots dy^{n}$$ Secondly, I've also read that in Riemannian geometry the volume element can be expressed as $$dVol=\sqrt{\lvert g\rvert}dx^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{m}$$ where $g$ is the determinant of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ defined on the manifold.

1710242,What exactly are the numbers we use everyday?,"Pi can be defined as diameter / circunference of a circle. But what is a circle? You can't tell a computer: ""build a circle and divide its diameter by its circumference"". You need to define what a circle is. Wikipedia defines a circle as: It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre. But that is just a statement about a property that circles have that allows us to uniquely identify them among the space of existing mathematical ideas. How do you actually build that circle? And how do actually find pi from that definition? There are no instructions on this definition. This definition doesn't explain how to build a circle, just identifies what it is. As an example, lets talk about trees. Trees are well-understood structures with an obvious computational representation. There are even many kind of trees and I can actually write down all of them how they truly are. Using the λ-calculus, for example, I can represent a complete, untagged binary tree of depth 2 using the lambda-church encoding: tree : (∀ (t : *) -> (t -> t -> t) -> t -> t)
tree = (λ branch tip . branch (branch tip tip) (branch tip tip)) That is a tree, on its true form. It doesn't just ""identify"" the essence of a tree by listing an unique property it has. I actually defines it. The type above perfectly captures the set of untagged binary trees, and the element I wrote is a member of that set. You can see it, you can inspect its structure and you can use it to do meaningful computation. If you study that type, you are studying untagged binary trees; it has all the properties you could expect from an untagged binary tree, because it is the actual definition of an untagged binary tree. Now, when it comes to numbers, we don't have that. If we ask a mathematician what is a natural number, or a real number, or a fractiona lnumber, he will keep proposing ""wordy"" statements that uniquely identify those sets, but he won't show you how to actually build those things. If you ask him to write down a number on paper, he will write 5 , or 6 . But that isn't a number. That is a decimal representation of a number that humans happen to like. Similarly, if you ask a computer scientist, he will talk about properties numbers have. If you ask him to show you how a number actually looks like, he might show you a 64-bit vectors. But those vectors aren't numbers too. Those only represent numbers. If we wanted to study bit vectors, we could, too: bits : (∀ (t : *) -> (t -> t) -> (t -> t) -> t -> t)
bits = (λ o z e . (o (z (o (o (z (z (z (z e))))))))) That is as good a definition of a bitvector as the definition above is of a tree. But it says nothing about numbers. It is, at most, isomorphic to the set of natural numbers. But that's where it ends. It doesn't say anything about natural numbers because it doesn't capture its essence in any meaningful way. Studying numbers through that definition would be like studying Japanese grammar in english. It is a layer of indirection. So, what is a number? What is its structure like? How do you represent, computationally, syntactically, the phenomena of a real number, of a complex number, a tensor? What algebraic structure has all the properties that a quaternion has, without layers of indirections?","['type-theory', 'computer-science', 'number-theory', 'computational-mathematics', 'philosophy']"

I have the following argument: Suppose we have $p+q$ people in a room with $p$ people in Group 1 and $q$ people in Group 2. Then, $\dbinom{p+q}2$ counts the number of ways we can select two people from the people in the entire room. However, $\dbinom p2$ and $\dbinom q2$ count the number of ways we can select two people from Group 1 and Group 2 respectively. Now, we can select two people from the entire room by either taking two people from Group 1 or taking two people from Group 1 or taking one person from Group 1 and another from Group 2. These are the only possible methods. So, the expression we have counts the number of ways we can select one person from Group 1 containing $p$ people and another person from Group 2 containing $q$ people. By the rule of product, we have $pq$ ways to do this and hence the value of the given expression is $pq$. $_\square$","['algebra-precalculus', 'combinatorics', 'combinatorial-proofs', 'proof-verification']"
1710492,Difference between the support of a discrete random variable and the atoms of its probability distribution,"I'm confused about the difference between the support of a discrete random variable and the atoms of its probability distribution. Suppose I have a discrete random variable $X$ defined on the probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ with support $\mathcal{A}\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. I am told that the distribution of $X$ is $H$ with $c$ atoms, $a_1,\ldots,a_c$. Question: Is $\{a_1,\ldots,a_c\}=\mathcal{A}$? My thought is the following: they are different because, while $\mathcal{A}$ could contain also a point $b$ at which $P(X=b)=0$, $P(X=a_i)>0$ for $i=1,\ldots,c$. Is this correct?","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'random-variables', 'probability-distributions']"
1710517,Show that 13 is the largest prime which divides two consecutive terms of $n^2 + 3$. [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : $13$ is the largest prime that can divide two successive integers of the form $n^2+3$ (1 answer) Closed 8 years ago . Show that 13 is the largest prime which divides two consecutive terms of $n^2 + 3$. The integers are $39$ and $52$. First of all, I set the variable for the number as $k$. So, $k|n^2 +3$ and $k|n^2 + 2n+ 4$ which imply that $k|2n+1$. $n=6$ over here. And the fact that 13 is the largest 'prime' makes me feel it is hard to prove. That's all I have managed to get. I need a few hints to set me in the right direction. Thanks.","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"
1710532,Formula for analytic function using Schwartz's Lemma,"I've been working on the following problem from Conway's complex variables book: Suppose $f$ is analytic in some region containing $\overline{B(0,1)}$ and $|f(z)|=1$ where $|z|=1$. Find a formula for $f$. (Hint: First consider the case where $f$ has no zeros in $B(0,1$). First, we know that if $f$ has no zeros in $B(0,1)$, it is a constant (this was an earlier problem in the book). In general, I believe $f$ has the form
$$f=c\prod_{i=1}^m\phi_{a_i}(z)^{m_i}$$
where $\phi_a(z)=\frac{z-a}{1-\overline{a}z}$ and $|c|=1$. Here's an incomplete justification as to why: First, if $f$ has one zero of order $1$ at, say $a$, it is one-to-one in a neighborhood of $a$ so $f$ has the form $f=c\phi_a$ where $|c|=1$ (I realized there's a problem here, because to apply the theorem which tells us that, we need $f$ to be one-to-one on all of $B(0,1)$, not just a neighborhood of $a$. Second, if $f$ has a zero of order $m$ at $a$, then write $f(z)=(z-a)^{m-1}h(z)$ where $h$ has a root of order $1$ at $a$. Define $g(z)=(1-\overline{a}z)^{m-1}$, which has a root of order $1$ at $a$, to write
$$f(z)=\frac{(z-a)^{m-1}}{(1-\overline{a}z)^{m-1}}g(z)$$
and apply the above to obtain $f(z)=c\phi_a(z)^m$. Now for any $f$, it has finitely many zeros in $B(0,1)$ and so I want to just take the product of the above, but I'm not sure how to justify that, either. Thank you.","['complex-analysis', 'analysis']"
1710549,Prov that function is eventually periodic to origin.,"Let $f:\mathbb{Z}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^4$ by $f(w,x,y,z) = (\mid w-x \mid,\mid x-y \mid,\mid y-z \mid,\mid z-w \mid)$ Prove that for any $(w,x,y,z) \in \mathbb{Z}^4$ there is $n>0$ such that $f^n(w,x,y,z)=(0,0,0,0)$ Prove that there is no $n$ such that $f^n(w,x,y,z)=(0,0,0,0)$ for all $(w,x,y,z) \in \mathbb{Z}^4$ I wrote a computer code in R that can execute this function for any integers $w,x,y,z$ and $n$.

1710575,Is the algebra of universally integrable functions a von Neumann algebra?,"I would like to continue this discussion . Let $X$ be a compact space. Let us call a function $f:X\to {\mathbb C}$ universally integrable if it is integrable with respect to each regular Borel measure $\mu$ on $X$ (one can imagine $\mu$ as an arbitrary positive continuous functional on ${\mathcal C}(X)$ ). We denote by ${\mathcal U}(X)$ the space of all universally integrable functions on $X$. Nate Eldredge noticed here , that ${\mathcal U}(X)$ is a $C^*$-algebra with respect to the sup-norm:
$$
||f||=\sup_{x\in X}|f(x)|.

1710585,defining the stopping time sigma algebra,"For a stopping time T, define $\mathcal{F}_T$ by $\mathcal{F}_T={A \in \mathcal{F}:A \cap \{T \le t\} \in \mathcal{F}_t, \text{for each t.}}$ Verify that $\mathcal{F}_T$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. To prove this I know we must show that $\mathcal{F}_T$ satisfies the three properties of  $\sigma$-algebras, ie that A $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of a set X is a collection $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets satisfying the following properties; (1) $\emptyset$ $\in$ $\mathcal{F}$ (2) if A $\in$ $\mathcal{F}$ then it's compliment $A^{c}$ is also in $\mathcal{F}$ (3) if $A_1,A_2,...$ is a countable collection of sets in $\mathcal{F}$  then their union $\cup^{\infty}_{n=1}A_n \in \mathcal{F}$ I have attempted this myself but am concerned I am not being precise enough. Any hints or comments are gladly welcome. For (3): Suppose $A_1,A_2,...$ is a countable collection of sets in $\mathcal{F}_T$ Then $A_n \in \mathcal{F}$ : $A_n \cap \{T \le t\} \in \mathcal{F}_t$ for all n by definition Then $\cup^{\infty}_{n=1}(A_n \cap \{T \le t\})\in \mathcal{F}_t$ Then $(\cup^{\infty}_{n=1}A_n) \cap (\{T \le t\})\in \mathcal{F}_t$ 
Then $(\cup^{\infty}_{n=1}A_n) \in \mathcal{F}_T$ For(2) I am less convinced My reasoning would be that if $A \in \mathcal{F}_T$ then $A \in \mathcal{F}: A \cap \{T \le t\} \in \mathcal{F}_t$ We know that $A \cap \{T \le t\} \in \mathcal{F}_t$ Now $A^c \in \mathcal{F}$ since $A^c = \mathcal{F}/A$ Then $A^{c} \cap \{T \le t\} = \mathcal{F} \cap \{T \le t\} - A \cap \{T \le t\}$ Since $\mathcal{F} \cap \{T \le t\} = \mathcal{F}_t$ Then $A^{c} \cap \{T \le t\} = \mathcal{F}_t - A \cap \{T \le t\}$ ie $A^{c} \in \mathcal{F}_T$ However for this to hold we must consider the situation where $A \cap \{T \le t\} = \mathcal{F}_t$ In other words here $A^c$ would be $\emptyset$ and this is where I'm stuck. If I could prove $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}_T$ (2) would follow so any hints to get me started would be really appreciated as I really don't know where to start, or if I am completely wrong that would also be good to know!

[Now pasted below. Ed.] I've come across a question in a textbook (linked above) requiring a least-squares fitted model of a sum of exponential terms. I have some experience using the least-squares criterion with single terms, ie  fitting a curve $y = Ae^x$ to some data, but none with sums of terms. Would it suffice to fit separate curves to each term? I'm not at all confident in my approach here, thanks for any help.","['statistics', 'physics', 'least-squares']"
1710591,Fastest way to show that $D_6 \to S_5$ is an injective homomorphism,"I want to show that there is an injective homomorphism from $D_6 \to S_5$ where $D_6$ denotes the dihidral group of order 12 and $S_5$ the symmetric group. But I'm not sure how I can do this efficiently. I define $f: D_6 \to S_5$ by $f(\sigma) = (12)$ and $f(\rho) = (123)(45)$, with $\sigma$ being a reflection and $\rho$ being a rotation. I know that $D_6$ is generated by $\rho$ and $\sigma$ and that $S_5$ is generated $(12), (23), (34), (45)$. So what is the fastest way, for someone who is just starting with algebra, to show that this is a homomorphism? Do I have to show it explicitly for all 12 elements? What confuses me is that you have to show for all $x,y \in D_6$ we have $f(xy)=f(x)(y)$, while $x$ and $y$ can be any combination of $\rho$ and $\sigma$. Lastly, what is the fastest way to show it's kernel is trivial without going over all elements?","['abstract-algebra', 'group-homomorphism', 'symmetry', 'dihedral-groups', 'group-theory']"

Let $C$ be the set of points $x$ in $R$ with the property that $S\cap (x-\delta,x+\delta )$ is uncountable for every $\delta > 0.$ Prove that $S - C$ is finite or countable. I started like this: Let $x$ $\in$ $S-C$ $=>$ $S\cap (x-\delta,x+\delta )$ is countable for some $\delta>0$. Also, $(S-C)\cap(x-\delta,x+\delta )\subset S\cap (x-\delta,x+\delta )$. So, $(S-C)\cap(x-\delta,x+\delta )$ is countable. Hence, for every $x$ $ \in$ $S-C$ , $\exists$ a $\delta>0$ such that $(S-C)\cap(x-\delta,x+\delta )$ is countable. But after that I couldn't advance.

1710620,Do homomorphisms $H \to \operatorname{Aut}(K)$ that coincide at the level of $\operatorname{Out}(K)$ induce isomorphic semidirect products?,"I recently realized that I don't know of any group that is a nontrivial semidirect product of some symmetric group $S_n$ and another group ($S_n$ being the normal subgroup), except when $n=6$. (For instance, $\operatorname{Aut}(S_6) \cong S_6 \rtimes C_2$.) I believe that this is because all outer automorphism groups of $S_n$ are trivial except when $n = 6$. In fact I believe this stronger statement is true: If $\phi,\psi:H \to \operatorname{Aut}(K)$ induce the same map $H \to \operatorname{Out}(K)$, then $K \rtimes_\phi H \cong K \rtimes_\psi H$. Writing things out, the hypothesis means that for all $h \in H$, there exists some $k_0 \in K$ (possibly dependent on $h$) such that $\phi_h(k) = k_0\psi_h(k)k_0^{-1}$ for all $k \in K$. (So this essentially reduces to this unanswered question modulo the fact that $k_0$ varies with $h$.) If our isomorphism $\theta:K \rtimes_\phi H \to K \rtimes_\psi H$ is to be of the form $\theta(k,h) = (\alpha(k),h)$ for some bijection $\alpha$, then for $\theta$ to be a homomorphism we must have equality between the expressions
$$\theta((k,h)(k',h')) = \theta(k\phi_h(k'),hh') = (\alpha(k\phi_h(k')),hh')$$ and
$$\theta(k,h)\theta(k',h') = (\alpha(k),h)(\alpha(k'),h') = (\alpha(k)\psi_h(\alpha(k')),hh'),$$ i.e., we must have $$\alpha(k\phi_h(k')) = \alpha(k)\psi_h(\alpha(k')) = \alpha(k)k_0^{-1}\phi_h(\alpha(k'))k_0.$$ I really don't see how we can choose such an $\alpha$. But maybe $\theta$ has a more complicated form. (Or maybe the statement is false!) Update : As Derek Holt has shown below, the statement is false in this generality. What can we say if $Z(K) = 1$, i.e., $K \cong \operatorname{Inn}(K)$? This is the case for $S_n$ ($n \geq 3$), for instance.","['abstract-algebra', 'semidirect-product', 'group-theory']"
