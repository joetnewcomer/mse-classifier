322926,"If $H$ and $G/H$ are compact, then $G$ is compact.","Suppose that $G$ is a topological group and that $H$ is  a subgroup of $G$ so that $H$ and $G/H$ are compact. I am trying to show that $G$ must be compact. The first idea is to use the natural map $f: G \rightarrow G/H$, this is a closed map since $H$ is compact. Thus if $\mathscr{C}$ is a collection of closed subsets of $G$ with finite intersection property (FIP), then $\{f(C): C \in \mathscr{C}\}$ a collection of closed subsets of $G/H$. This collection also has FIP because $$f(C_1 \cap \ldots \cap C_n) \subseteq f(C_1) \cap \ldots \cap f(C_n)$$ so $\{f(C): C \in \mathscr{C}\}$ has nonempty intersection because $G/H$ is compact. So there exists some coset $gH$ that is contained in every $f(C)$, that is $C \cap gH$ is nonempty. My next idea would be to show that $\{C \cap gH: C \in \mathscr{C}\}$ is a collection of closed sets in $gH$ with FIP. Then this collection, and thus $\mathscr{C}$ would have nonempty intersection. We know that $C \cap gH$ is closed in $gH$, but I don't know how to show that it has FIP. Right now I think that might not even be true in general, since our choice of $gH$ was arbitrary. How can I choose $gH$ in the intersection $\cap_{C \in \mathscr{C}} f(C)$ so that $\cap_{C \in \mathscr{C}} C \cap gH$ is nonempty? Does this proof idea work?","['general-topology', 'topological-groups']"

323033,example of a set that is closed and bounded but not compact,"Find an example of a subset $S$ of a metric space such that $S$ is closed and bounded but not compact. One such example that comes from analysis is probably a closed and bounded set in $C[0,1]$ . I attempt to construct my own example to see if it works. Is $\{ \frac{1}{n} | n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ endowed with discrete topology a set that is closed and bounded but not compact?

323056,$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\lambda l}{2\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+l^2)^{3/2}}dx$ Proving an electric field from a wire falls off at $1/l$,"If you don't know the physics behind all this, that's okay, I just need the integral of this function (or limit, I'm not too sure). Here's the gist: normally with infinitesimal point charges, there is an electric field (represented by vectors everywhere in space) that points radially outward from the position of the point, and its magnitude falls off as $\frac{1}{r^2}$. Here is the whole equation for you just to give you some background: $$E = \frac{q}{4*\pi*\epsilon_0*r^2}$$ Where $q$ and $\epsilon_0$ are just constants. Now imagine a continuous straight line of these infinitesimally small particles, giving it one dimension. I am trying to find the electric field at one point as a product of all these particles integrated together (from infinity to negative infinity). As my variable in the integration, ill use $x$ - the length of the wire traversed so far. And to replace $q$, ill use $\lambda*dx$, making $\lambda$ a constant density of charge per unit length (simulating the point charges as $dx$ approaches 0). Now this means that $r$ will turn into more of a Pythagorean theorem, as we are trying to find the electric field at one point caused from the whole wire. To replace $r$, ill use $l$ and $x$ ($l$ being the perpendicular length away from the wire). Thus $r$ then becomes $\sqrt{x^2+l^2}$. Now here's where it gets a little tricky. The electric field calculated from each point is a vector , and points in a direction. But because we have a one dimensional wire as the source of each field, that means that the E-field caused from $x$ will cancel out the field caused from
$-x$ (but it won't cancel out the e-field in the direction perpindicular to the wire). For this we just multiply the magnitude of the electric field by $cos(\theta)$, with $\theta$ being the angle difference between the normal vector (90 degrees, perpindicular to the wire) and the electric field vector. Now an even more fun problem! How do we get $\theta$? Through the inverse tangent of $x$ and $l$! And what do we end up getting? $$\cos(\theta) = \cos(\arctan(x/l)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+(x/l)^2}}$$ But the thing is that there are two sides that cancel out, doubling the value we get from the cosine. So now let's recap. Here is the revised equation so far: $$E = \frac{\lambda*dx}{2*\pi*\epsilon_0*\sqrt{x^2+l^2}^2*\sqrt{1+(x/l)^2}}$$ $\sqrt{x^2+l^2}^2$ simplifies to $(x^2+l^2)$, and $\sqrt{1+(x/l)^2}$ simplifies to $\frac{\sqrt{l^2+x^2}}{l}$. Thus, the whole equation is now $$E = \frac{\lambda*dx*l}{2*\pi*\epsilon_0*(x^2+l^2)^{3/2}}$$ Where $\lambda$ and $\epsilon_0$ are constants. Now my question is, ""what is the integration of this function over infinity, and how do I do it?"". $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\lambda\cdot dx\cdot l}{2\pi\epsilon_0(x^2+l^2)^{3/2}}$$ I really appreciate your help or any tips!

And we get the two points... Ok, I hope I'm doing good so far. Next to do is to find the $f''(x)$.

Then applying $- \otimes_{F_p[x^p]}F_p[x]$ to the natural injection $F_p[x^p] \to F_p[x]$ shows that the map $F_p[x] \to F_p[x] \otimes_{F_p[x^p]}F_p[x]$ given by $f \to f \otimes 1$ is injective.

In particular, show that every automorphism of $\mathbb{Q}[x]/\langle x^{3}-2\rangle$ that fixes $\mathbb{Q}$ also fixes all of $\mathbb{Q}[x]/\langle x^{3}-2\rangle$.

Show $\varphi(\beta)= \beta$. $\varphi(\beta) = \varphi(a+b\alpha+c\alpha^{2}) = \varphi(a) +\varphi(b\alpha)+\varphi(c\alpha^{2}) = a+b\varphi(\alpha)+c\varphi(\alpha^{2})$ (since a,b,c are in F, which is the fixed field).

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Part b: Show that [$\varphi(\alpha)]^{3} = 2$. Once we have this then we can conclude that $\beta^{3} = 2$ has only one solution $\beta\in K$. $\bf{Thoughts:}$ I already showed that [$\varphi(\alpha)]^{3} = 2$ by using that fact that since it's an automorphism, so then we can bring the power of 3 into the automorphism so that it's actually: $\varphi(\alpha^{3}) = \varphi(2) = 2$ since $2 \in F$, which is the fixed field. Then this part is done. Part c: To show that there is only one cube root of 2 in K, factor $\beta^{3} - 2 = \beta^{3} - \alpha^{3} = (\beta -\alpha)(\beta^{2}+\alpha\beta+\alpha^{2})$. Conclude that it suffices to show that $\beta^{2}+\alpha\beta+\alpha^{2}\ne 0$ for all $\beta \in K$. $\bf{Thoughts:}$ So I wrote the factoring out, and concluded that the only way for that to happen was if $\beta -\alpha = 0$, implying that $\beta = \alpha$ $\textit{or}$ $\beta^{2}+\alpha\beta+\alpha^{2} = 0$ for all $\beta\in K$. So then this part is done. Part d: By way of contradiction, show that if $\exists \beta \in K$ such that $\beta^{2}+\alpha\beta+\alpha^{2} = 0$, then writing $\beta$ as $\beta = a+b\alpha+c\alpha^{2}$, we necessarily have $$\
0 = a^{2}+2c(1+2b),\\
0 = a(1+2b)+2c^{2},\\
0 = 1+b+b^{2}+2ac$$ Show that there are no rational numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ which satisfy these equations. (which this ends the entire proof cuz it shows that $\varphi = e$) $\bf{Thoughts:}$ I understand what we're supposed to do for this part of the problem, but I'm not sure how to start showing that there are no rational numbers which satisfy these equations. Thanks, in advance, for the help. Sorry those three equations aren't centered, I'm not entirely sure how to do that in Latex quite yet, and what I did try didn't work.","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
323224,Show the direct sum is a proper subset of the direct product.,"I searched all the posts on the direct sum and direct product, and found the following explanation: For a finite number of factors, the direct sum and direct product of abelian groups (and more generally, of R-modules) are equal. However, when you have an infinite number of summands/factors, the two constructions are different. Explicitly, the direct product
$$\prod_{i∈I}A_i$$
is the collection of all functions $f:I→∪A_i$ with $f(i)∈A_i$ for each $i$ (you can think of them as the ""tuples"" indexed by $i$, with the $i$th coordinate being the value $f(i)$). But the direct sum
$$\bigoplus_{i∈I} A_i$$
is the collection of all functions $f:I→∪A_i$ with: $f(i)∈A_i$ for each $i$; and $f(i)=0$ for all except perhaps a finite number of $i$. That is, the direct sum is the subgroup/submodule of the direct product that consists of the almost-null elements. When there are only finitely many coordinates, saying ""all are zero except perhaps for a finite number of coordinates"" is the same as saying nothing. Question) What I can't see is the number 2 condition for the direct sum. Can anybody explain how to show 2?","['vector-spaces', 'elementary-set-theory']"

I would like to discuss different answers and approaches. Please see pg 162-163 on books.google.ca/books?isbn=0387290524 There are 5 questions from 7.6.3 - 7.6.7. You can read the paragraph above 7.6.3. You can also read the first part on quarternions. Exclude the ""rotations of ijk space section. Here is what I have tried. Q1: I used the Pythagorean Theorem to get the norm equal to $ \sqrt{2} $. Then I used the property $ \text{Norm}(uv) = \text{Norm}(u) \text{Norm}(v) $ to show that that $ 2 = \text{Norm}(1 - i^{2}) $. Am I right? Q2: I used the property $ \text{Norm}(uv) = \text{Norm}(u) \text{Norm}(v) $ since $ \text{Norm}(i) = 1 $. But I don’t know how to show $ i^{2} = -1 $. One says to use the Triangle Inequality. I guess the equality implies that $ i^{2} $ and $ 1 $ are collinear. Q3: And thus I don’t know how to do this. Q4: The map $ p \longmapsto pi $ multiplies all distances in $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $ by $ |i| = 1 $, since $ |pi| = |p||i| $. For any points $ p_{1} $ and $ p_{2} $ in $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $, $ |p_{1} * i - p_{2} * i| = |(p_{1} - p_{2})i| = |p_{1} - p_{2}||i| $. Therefore, the distance $ |p_{1} - p_{2}| $ between any two points is multiplied by $ |i| = 1 $. Therefore, the map is an isometry of $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $. Therefore, since $ i $ and $ j $ are perpendicular directions, $ i * i $ and $ i * j $ are still perpendicular by the isometry. (An isometry preserves the distance between points.) Still not sure why $ \mathbf{1} $ and $ ij $ are perpendicular. Q5: From $ jiij= j i^{2} j = jj i^{2} = j^{2} i^{2} = - \mathbf{1} * - \mathbf{1} = \mathbf{1} $, therefore $ 1 = -1 $, which is a contradiction.","['geometry', 'algebra-precalculus', 'abstract-algebra', 'quaternions', 'linear-algebra']"

We want to find a stopping time $T$ such that $B_T\sim F$ and $ET=\sigma^2$. $B$ denotes a Brownian Motion.

I know that for $\tau:=\inf\{t:B_t\notin (a,b)\}$, where $a<0<b$ has the property $$P(B_\tau=b)=\frac{-a}{b-a}$$
$$E\tau=|ab|$$ What is meant by: pick a pair $\alpha <0<\beta$ according to the distribution $\mu$? Is it meant that I choose $\alpha$ according to $F_-$ and $\beta$ to $F_+$?

Since every point in $B$ has an open neighborhood $U$ whose preimage $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is homeomorphic to $U\times F$ via $\phi_U=(\pi,\beta_U)$, there are finitely many such sets covering $B$. Let's call this collection $\mathcal U$. Then $\mathcal S:=\{\phi_U^{-1}(V\times W)\mid U\in\mathcal U,V\text{ open}\subseteq U,W\text{ open}\subseteq F\}$ is a subbase for the topology on $E$. By Alexander's subbase lemma we can restrict ourselves to considering a cover $\mathcal C\subseteq\mathcal S$ of $E$. (Mariano Suárez-Alvarez recommends this in his answer here ) For each $b\in B$ the fiber $\pi^{-1}(b)$ is compact and thus contained in the union ${\bigcup_{i=1}^{n_b}\phi^{-1}_{U_i^b}(V_i^b\times W_i^b)}$ of sets in $\mathcal C$. Define $V^b:=\bigcap_{i=1}^{n_b}V_i^b$. By compactness $B=\bigcup_{k=1}^l V^{b_k}$. I think that $E=\bigcup_{k=1}^l\bigcup_{i=1}^{n_{b_k}}\phi^{-1}_{U_i^{b_k}}(V_i^{b_k}\times W_i^{b_k})$, similar to the proof of compactness of the product of two compact spaces. Unlike the trivial bundle case, however, where the homeo's are just identities, here the $\phi_{U}$'s could be pretty ugly, especially where they are overlapping, and we don't have $y\in\bigcup_{i=1}^{n_{b_k}}\phi^{-1}_{U_i^{b_k}}(V_i^{b_k}\times W_i^{b_k})\ $   whenever   $\ \pi(y)\in V^{b_k}$ So I try to get to a contradiction by assuming that for each $k=1,\dots,m$ such that $\pi(y)\in V^{b_k}$ we have $\forall i=1,\dots,n_k:\ y\notin\phi^{-1}_{U_i^{b_k}}(V_i^{b_k}\times W_i^{b_k})$ which then implies $\beta_{U^k_i}(y)\notin W_i^{b_k}$. If there were a $k$ such that $U^k_1,\dots,U^k_{n_k}$ were all the same then I would be finished. But maybe the $b_k$'s should have been chosen in certain way. Maybe someone remembers how the proof worked.","['general-topology', 'fiber-bundles', 'compactness']"

323801,Two Definitions of the Special Orthogonal Lie Algebra,"I am encountering two definitions of the special orthogonal lie algebra, and I would like to know if they are equivalent, and if there are advantages to working with one over the other. If we begin with an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ over a field $k$ and a chosen basis, we can define a bilinear form on $V$ by a matrix $S\in M_n(k)$, ie, let $\langle v,w\rangle=v^tSw$ for all $v,w\in V$.  Now $g\in GL_n(k)$ preserves the form ($\langle g(v),g(w)\rangle=\langle v,w\rangle$) if and only if $g^tSg=S$, so all such $g$ form a linear algebraic group $G$.  The tangent space at the identity of $G$ will be contained in that of $GL_n(k)$, so $T_eG\subset T_eGL_n(k)=M_n(k)$, and in fact, $T_eG=\{B\in M_n(k)\mid B^tS+SB=0\}$.  $T_eG$ becomes a lie algebra, $Lie(G)$, if we define the bracket to be the commutator of two matrices. Now, if $S=I_n$, it follows that $G=O_n(k)$ is the orthogonal group of matrices satisfying $g^tg=I_n$, and $Lie(G)=\mathfrak{so}_n$ is the lie algebra of antisymmetric matrices. In Humphrey's Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory , he defines $\mathfrak{so}_n$ to be all matrices $B$ satisyfing $B^tS+SB=0$, where
$$
S=\begin{pmatrix}
1&0&0\\
0&O&I_l\\
0&I_l&O
\end{pmatrix}
\hspace{.5in}\text{or}\hspace{.5in}
S=\begin{pmatrix}
O&I_l\\
I_l&O
\end{pmatrix}
$$
depending on the parity of $n$.  The matrices obtained in this way are not antisymmetric, nor is the group $G$ preserving the form defined by $S$ the orthogonal group $O_n(k)$. Are the two groups obtained from considering different $S$ isomorphic?  Are the two lie algebras isomorphic?  If so, why would one prefer one form to the other?","['linear-algebra', 'lie-algebras', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

The intersection of every countable collection of dense open subsets of a complete metric space is dense. My draft: Let $(A_k)$ be a sequence of dense open sets in $X$. Then for each $k$, we get
$$
A_k \mbox{ is dense }\Leftrightarrow \overline{A_k}=X \Leftrightarrow \mbox{int }A_{k}^c=\varnothing.

324010,"Should I try to change the way Abstract Algebra is taught at my university? If so, how?","[This (soft) question should be Community Wiki.] Background: A year ago, I did a one-semester long course on Abstract Algebra at my university. When we started, I was excited, because I knew the material presented in this course would be somewhat different from the things I had learned previously (including subjects like calculus, linear algebra, logic, graph theory, et cetera). I also knew Abstract Algebra is a very broad subject, and many modern subjects are rooted in its matter, including Algebraic Geometry, Algebraic Topology, Algebraic Number Theory, and many more subjects. I would be disappointed, however. The course was hard. I didn't mind that (I suspected it would). I didn't mind others being naturally better at it than me (as I'm not a particularly talented mathematician). I do think that I could have learned the material better if it would be presented in a different matter, though. Every student received a little booklet, containing course notes. All material was in there. I felt that the material was presented in quite a dense manner. I like to see a lot of worked examples of new material I'm learning, but there weren't many in there. I guess the booklet covered in 135 pages about the same material the abstract algebra book by Dummit and Foote covers in about 223 pages. I guess a somewhat bigger ""reference book"", like Dummit and Foote's or Fraleigh's book, would serve me better. Furthermore, we had to do a lot of exercises from the booklet. Each week, we had to hand in assignments, consisting of exercises in the booklet. Everything went pretty fast. Your work would be checked and graded, but the ""ideal"" solutions would not be shown on, for example, a webpage. I also found that disappointing, because I often learn a lot from worked solutions to exercises I do not (completely) understand. In the end, I barely passed the course and decided that I would not follow more abstract algebra courses in the future. This was ""Abstract Algebra I"". Next year, there were optional courses called ""Abstract Algebra II"" and ""Abstract Algebra III"". These courses contain subject matter on Rings, Fields, Galois Theory, Ideals, and more. This meant that, along with about half of my classmates who also would not be attending these further courses, I wouldn't learn about these interesting subjects. Sure, I can buy some ""easy"" introductory abstract algebra book (like Pinter's) and work my way through it, but I doubt it's the ""real deal"" and I will understand the material as well as my classmates who will follow ""Abstract Algebra II"" and ""Abstract Algebra III"". I think this way, many talent is wasted. The abstract algebra courses feel a bit like a rat race, in which only the very best survive (until the end of algebra III). I don't think this is o.k. . It seems to me that the notions developed abstract algebra could aid you in the study of other subjects that may not be explicitely related to abstract algebra. Questions: Should I even bother trying to change the way abstract algebra is currently taught at my university? Do you think these complaints are legitimate? Or should I stop whining and accept abstract algebra just isn't for me, nor ever will be? If you think these complaints are, at least to a certain extend, legitimate, I wonder how you think I should tell my university professors to do things differently. Just to be clear: I think I won't benefit from the changes made in the way this subject is taught at our university (if any changes are to be made at all), since by then I probably will have already finished my bachelor's degree. So this question is intented for future students.","['soft-question', 'education', 'abstract-algebra']"

$$ But the answer in my book is given as $$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\pi} + \frac{1}{2} \sin(x)+ \frac {2}{\pi} \left(\frac {\cos(2x)}{2^2-1} + \frac {\cos(4x)}{4^2-1}+\frac {\cos(6x)}{6^2-1}+\dotsb\right)$$ I don't understand how there is a sine term and the denominator of the cosines has $-1$.","['fourier-series', 'integration', 'complex-analysis']"
324078,Is electrostatic energy positive definite?,"This is a question coming from physics, but its nature is purely mathematical. Given some continuous distribution of charge $\rho$ (take it compactly supported, or ""nice enough"" depending on the problem you are treating), we define the electrostatic energy as: $$E[\rho]=\frac{1}{8\pi}\int d^3x\int d^3y \frac{\rho(\vec{x})\rho(\vec{y})}{|\vec{x}-\vec{y}|}$$ Is it positive definite? How to show it?","['integration', 'physics']"
324101,A question on Lebesgue measurable functions,"Let $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a Lebesgue measurable function, and define a function $\phi:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ by $\phi(x,y):=f(x-y)$.  I want to prove that $\phi$ is Lebesgue measurable, i.e. , given an open set $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, $\phi^{-1}\left[\mathcal{O}\right]\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ is Lebesgue measurable.  I first attempted to take advantage of the fact that the function $g:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined by $g(x,y):=x-y$ is continuous, as here $\phi=f\circ g$.  However, this approach failed, as the composition is in the wrong order; the continuous function $g$ is on the inside, so $\phi^{-1}\left[\mathcal{O}\right]=\left(f\circ g\right)^{-1}\left[\mathcal{O}\right]=g^{-1}\left[f^{-1}\left[\mathcal{O}\right]\right]$, which is not helpful, as the preimage of a Lebesgue measurable set under a continuous function need not be Lebesgue measurable.  My next attempt involved taking $\mathcal{O}$ to be a basic open interval of the form $\left(a,b\right)\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ and considering $\phi^{-1}\left[\mathcal{O}\right]$ directly, but I have as yet been unable to determine the nature of $\phi^{-1}\left[\mathcal{O}\right]$.  I’m not sure whether I’m on the right track or not here, so any suggestions would be appreciated.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
