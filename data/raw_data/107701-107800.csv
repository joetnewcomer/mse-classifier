1540612,Is Rudin correct here? Fubini's theorem and product measures,"Let $X, Y$ be locally compact Hausdorff spaces with nonnegative regular measures $\mu, \lambda$.  By definition (in the book I'm reading) a regular measure is a Borel measure for which every Borel set can be approximated from below by compact sets, or from above by open sets.  In the appendix in Rudin's book Fourier Analysis on Groups , he makes a couple of statements which I have not found anywhere else.  I just wanted to confirm that they are correct.  First there is: There is a unique regular measure $\mu \times \lambda$ on $X \times Y$ for which $\mu \times \lambda(A \times B) = \mu(A) \lambda(B)$ for $A \subseteq X, B \subseteq Y$ Borel. This statement seems fishy to me, because I know product measures are in general not uniquely determined by their values on products of Borel sets.  Some things can happen when $X$ or $Y$ is not $\sigma$-finite.  Next there is: (""Fubini's theorem"") If $f \geq 0$ is a Borel function on $X \times Y$, then $$ \int\limits f d(\mu \times \lambda) = \int\limits_X \int\limits_Y f(x,y)d\lambda(y) d\mu(x) = \int\limits_Y \int\limits_X f(x,y)d \mu(x) d \lambda(y) $$ The reason I am concerned with this is that there is a very similar result stated in Hewitt and Ross, Abstract Harmonic Analysis , Theorem 13.9, which makes the same claim for $f \geq 0$ Borel (although they allow $f$ to take on the value infinity, Rudin clearly does not).  This theorem gives the same result, but requires the addition hypothesis that $f$ vanishes off of a countable union of $(\mu \times \lambda)$-measurable sets which each have finite measure. Would any experts on the subtleties of regular measures be willing to explain why or confirm that Rudin's statements are correct?  One thing I am wondering is whether Rudin is tacitly assuming $X,Y$ and $X \times Y$ have an additional property (which is true of locally compact Hausdorff abelian groups, which is what his book is mainly concerned with), namely that each space is a disjoint union of $\sigma$-compact subspaces $X_{\alpha}$, such that every $\sigma$-compact subset of $X$ is contained in a countable union of the $X_{\alpha}$.","['harmonic-analysis', 'reference-request', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1540653,A necessity property of compact subset of Skorokhod space,"This is the Problem 3.16 of Ethier and Kurtz's Markov Processes Characterization and Convergence Let $(E,r)$ be complete.

As I know given $x\in A$, $\{x(t):t\in [0,T]\}$ is totally bounded, so its closure is compact. Since $A$ is compact in $D_E[0,\infty)$, $A$ is totally bounded, so it has a $\varepsilon$-net for each $\varepsilon>0$. I don't know how to continue. Any help please.

1540698,How many arrangements of a bookshelf exist where certain books must be to the left/right of other books?,"The question at length is exactly this: There are five distinct computer science books, three distinct
  mathematics books, and two distinct art books. In how many ways can
  these books be arranged on a shelf if one of the mathematics books is
  on the left of all computer science book, and another mathematics book
  is on the right of all the computer science books? I have searched a ton online for a question that's even similar to this but have yet to find one. Most examples have set groupings of books to create an 'object' but none have the kind of modular specifications of this question. I realize that there is ambiguity about if the math books are directly flush with the computer science books, or if they can be 'anywhere to the left/right' of the computer science books. I've attempted this question under the more challenging assumption and have gotten an answer as follows: There are 4 different placements of two math books that will allow for the computer science books to be completely between the two. 1) 8 spaces between the two math books M__________M (1 way) 2) 7 spaces between the two math books: M_______M_ and _M_______M (2 ways) 3) 6 spaces: M______M__, _M______M_, __M______M (3 ways) 4) 5 spaces: M_____M___, _M_____M__, __M_____M_, ___M_____M. (4 ways) Then I wanted to find the permutations of each of the ways above by the Rule of Product, and add them together by the Rule of Sum to get my final answer. (1) 8 spaces : P(3, 2) * P(8, 8) [Delimiting math books]  * [permutations in between] (2) 7 spaces : P (3, 2) * P(3, 1) * P(7, 7) * 2 [Delimiting math books] * [Options for book outside of delimitation] * [Permutations in-between] * [number of ways to achieve 7 spaces] (3) 6 spaces : P (3, 2) * P(3, 2) * P(6, 5) * 3 [Delimiting math books] * [options for 2 books outside delimitation] * [permutation in-between] * [number of ways to achieve 6 spaces] (4) 5 Spaces : P (3, 2) * P(3,3) * P(5, 5) * 4 [Delimiting math books] * [options for 3 books outside delimitation] * [permutation in-between] * [number of ways to achieve 5 spaces] Then my final answer would be (1) + (2) + (3) + (4). My worry is that I'm missing some duplicates somehow. Also conveniently, I believe the total for 5 spaces would satisfy the simpler question if it is actually referring to permutations with the chunk MCCCCCM. Thanks in advance! I'd love to see specifically what I'm doing wrong (if I am indeed wrong).","['discrete-mathematics', 'permutations']"
1540700,Cone with deficit angle $2\pi$,"I've managed to confuse myself with cones and deficit angles. Let's consider a conical defect in 2 dimensions. So the metric is the usual one in polar coordinates,
$$ ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\phi^2,$$
except that now $\phi \sim \phi + 2\pi(1-\alpha)$. For $\alpha = 0$, the is just flat space. When $\alpha \neq 0$, there is a singularity in the curvature, and for example the Ricci scalar acquires a delta function: 
$$R(x) = 4\pi \alpha \, \delta^{(2)}_{x,x'}, $$
where $x'$ is the location of the conical defect. Now if we use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (remembering that in 2 dimensions $R=K/2$, where $K$ is the Gaussian curvature), we can relate the deficit angle to the Euler characteristic (neglecting any boundary terms)
$$ \chi = \alpha.$$ So my confusion now is: what does it mean to have $\alpha = 1$, which is to say that the deficit angle is $2\pi$? It seems weird that I can remove the whole angle and still have a 2 dimensional space. Since I don't have much intuition for what it means to remove $2\pi$, I looked up what manifolds have $\chi = 1$, I find things like the disk (which has a boundary), and the real projective plane, which is $S^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-orientable. So what space is a cone with deficit angle $2\pi$? (Bonus question: what space has deficit angle $4\pi$, the Euler formula would suggest a sphere?)","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

1540841,Images of linearly equivalent divisors are linear equivalent?,"Let $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ be a finite morphism of degree $d$ projective surfaces over $\mathbb{C}$. Suppose that $X$ is smooth. Let $L'$ be a line bundle on $Y$, and let $L=f^*L'$. 1)  Consider a smooth curve $C\in |L|$. If the image $f(C)$ is a smooth curve on $Y$ which is a Cartier divisor, then does $f(C)\in |L'|$. 2) More generally if two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ are linearly equivalent in $X$. Consider their images $C_1'$ and $C_2'$, and suppose that they Cartier divisors in $Y$. If $f|_{C}:C_i\longrightarrow C_i'$ are finite morphisms of degree $d$. Then are the images linearly equivalent too? I suppose that they are, because that linear equivalence is preserved by direct images. So if $C_1 \sim C_2$, then $f_*(C_1)\sim f_*(C_2)$. That is $d.C_1'\sim d.C_2'$. Hence $C_1'\sim C_2'$. Is this right?","['algebraic-geometry', 'surfaces']"

$$E[Y^2|X-Y] = E[V^2| U]$$
Which was equal to $\frac {(1-U)^3}{3} I_{(0,1)}(U) + (\frac 13 + \frac {U^3}2) I_{(-1,0)}(U)$. I used this in the following manner
$$E[V^2| U^+] = E[E[V^2|U]|U^+]$$
Which led to two cases
$$U\in (0,1):\; \frac 13 E[(1-U)^3| U^+] = \frac 13 E[(1-U)^3| U] = \frac 13 (1-U)^3$$
$$U \in (-1,0): \; \frac 12 E[U^3|U^+] + \frac 13 = \frac 12 E[U^3] + \frac 13$$ I am frankly quite confused at this point as to what I'm actually doing. Questions: $E[(1-U)^3| U^+] = E[(1-U)^3| U]$ is fair since $[U \in (0,1)] = [U^+ \in (0,1)]$ is that correct? $E[U^3|U^+ ] = E[U^3]$ because $U^3 \bot U^+$, given $U\in (-1,0)$ More importantly, this all seems very dodgy. The whole two-cases business is quite unjustified in my mind and I am not sure, for example, what $E[U^3]$ is now supposed to be if $U\in (-1,0)$. My guess is it'd be zero as we're dealing with the triangular (symmetric) distribution and we're only saying the expression equals for $U\in (-1,0)$. But this would render 2. untrue, if I apply the knowledge of what values I am currently considering only after I do the calculation - as I said, I am confused. I'd appreciate an attempt at clearing this up in my head.

1541386,IRV failing monotonicity criterion,"I am looking for the simplest possible example of instant runoff voting failing the monotonicity criterion.

1541512,"Convergence of the sequence $a_{n+1}=\frac{a_n^2(a_n-3)}{4}, a_0=-\frac12$","I approached the problem as follows. First, note that if $a_n<0$ then $a_{n+1}<0$. Since $a_0<0$, it follows that the sequence is bounded above by zero. Now, consider the difference $a_{n+1}-a_n=\frac{a_n}{4}(a_n+1)(a_n-4)$. We know already that $a_n<0$, so there are two possibilities two consider: 1) $a_n\in (-1,0)\implies a_{n+1}>a_n$ and 2) $a_n\leqslant -1\implies a_{n+1}\leqslant a_n$. In the first case we have a bounded monotone sequence, hence it converges to $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=a^*$, where $-\frac12 \leqslant a^*\leqslant 0$. Taking the limit as $n\to \infty$ of $a_{n+1}-a_n$ we obtain $\frac{a^*}{4}(a^*+1)(a^*-4)=0$. It follows that $a^*\in\{-1,0,4\}\cap\left[-\frac12,0\right]$, so in this case $a^*=0$. To eliminate the second possibility we use $a_0=-\frac12$ to prove by induction that $\left|a_n\right|\leqslant\frac12$ implies $\left|a_{n+1}\right|\leqslant\frac{1}{4\cdot4}\left(3+\frac12\right)=\frac{7}{32}\leqslant\frac12$ and hence $\left|a^*\right|\leqslant \frac12$.

1541563,Why do we care about differential forms? (Confused over construction),"So it's said that differential forms provide a coordinate free approach to multivariable calculus. Well, in short I just don't get this, despite reading from many sources. I shall explain how it all looks to me. Let's just stick to $\mathbb{R}^2$ for the sake of simplicity (maybe this is the down fall..). Picking some point $P=(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2$, we could ask about the directional derivative of some function $f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, in direction $v=a\vec{i}+b\vec{j}$.  This will be $$(\nabla \cdot v)|_P(f)=a\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}|_P+b\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}|_P =\underbrace{ (a\dfrac{\partial }{\partial x}|_P+b\dfrac{\partial }{\partial y}|_P)}_\text{$w_P$ }(f)$$ Where we can think of $w_P$ as an element of the tangent space at $P$. Now this in itself is a little weird; why have differential operators as a basis for something geometrical like a tangent space to a manifold? In any case, we apply these vectors to a function defined on our manifold, and we get the value we wanted out. So who cares about differential forms? We just did all this without them. We could've done this by calculating $\mathrm{d}f$, in some basis $\mathrm{d}x, \mathrm{d}y$ (which is quite confusing), and then calculating $\mathrm{d}f(w_P)$, but what do we gain in doing it this way? I mentioned I think the $\mathrm{d}x$'s are confusing. Well, $\mathrm{d}x$ is just the function $\mathrm{d}x(\frac{\partial}{\partial x})=1$ and 0 for any other differential operator -  why write this as $\mathrm{d}x$, which had always previously been used to mean an infinitesimal increase in x? Now I can understand caring about the dual of the tangent space. We are combining a vector in the tangent space with something and we're getting a scalar out of it - this something should then probably belong to the dual space. But if we're thinking of just the vector, then the function $f$ on the manifold needs to be encoded by the 1-form, right? Well, we can have 1-forms which aren't derivatives of any function on the manifold - what should it mean to combine such forms with tangent vectors? And lastly, if we're writing all our forms in terms of $\mathrm{d}x$'s etc., where the $x$'s are exactly the coordinates of the manifold, then how exactly have we escaped dependence on coordinates? We're still essentially calculating with respect to a given coordinate system as in usual multivariable calculus!","['differential-geometry', 'multivariable-calculus', 'differential-forms']"

    0       & a

$$ P(A)=\begin{bmatrix}
    P(a)       & P'(a)  \\
    0       & P(a)
\end{bmatrix}$$ Where $P'(a)$ is the derivative evaluated at $a$. Futhermore, I tried extending this to other matrix functions, for example the matrix exponential, and wolfram alpha tells me:
$$ \exp(A)=\begin{bmatrix}
    e^a       & e^a  \\
    0       & e^a
\end{bmatrix}$$
and this does in fact follow the pattern since the derivative of $e^x$ is itself! Furthermore, I decided to look at the function $P(x)=\frac{1}{x}$. If we interpret the reciprocal of a matrix to be its inverse, then we get:
$$ P(A)=\begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{1}{a}       & -\frac{1}{a^2}  \\
    0       & \frac{1}{a}

\frac{\sum _{k=0}^{n-1} e^{x e^{\frac{2 i \pi  k}{n}}}}{n}=
G(x e^{\frac{2 i \pi}{n}},n)=
\prod_{m=1}^\infty \left(1+\left(\frac{x}{r(n,m)}\right)^n\right)
$$
where $r(n,m)$ is the $m$th biggest absolute value of a root of $G(x,n)$. The complex roots for $G(x,2)$ and $G(x,4)$ are trivial to find.
$r(2,m)=\left(m-\frac{1}{2}\right)\pi$ and
$r(4,m)=\left(m-\frac{1}{2}\right)\pi\sqrt{2}$. Because of rotational symmetry $G(x,3)=G(x e^{\frac{2 i \pi}{3}},3)$, we only need to find the roots on the real line.
Note that
$$G(x,3)=\frac{1}{3} \left(e^x+2 e^{-\frac{x}{2}} \cos \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} x}{2}\right)\right)$$
From this we can see that as $x\rightarrow -\infty$, the roots of $G(x,3)$ become arbitrarily close to the roots of $\cos \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} x}{2}\right)$ Because of this, we can use Newton's Method to find the roots of $G(x,3)$ by starting with the roots of $\cos \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} x}{2}\right)$. The Mathematica code for $r(3,m)$ is -x /. FindRoot[E^(3 x/2) + 2 Cos[(Sqrt[3] x)/2], {x, -2 Pi (-1/2 + m)/Sqrt[3]}] This is not good enough though. I desire a formula for $r(3,m)$ which does not not involve a FindRoot. Also, because you could define Newton's method exactly with a limit, limits are not allowed in the final formula. Because of input from the comments, we now have a new formula for $r(3,m)$:
$$\frac{\pi(2m-1)}{\sqrt{3}}-\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{\left(-e^{\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3} (\pi -2 \pi  m)}\right)^n \left(\lim_{x\to \frac{\pi -2 \pi  m}{\sqrt{3}}} \, \frac{\partial ^{n-1}}{\partial x^{n-1}}\left(\frac{x-\frac{\pi -2 \pi  m}{\sqrt{3}}}{-e^{\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3} (\pi -2 \pi  m)}+e^{\frac{3 x}{2}}+2 \cos \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} x}{2}\right)}\right)^n\right)}{n!}$$
Though Mathematica cannot calculate this, the corresponding Mathematica code is: -(([Pi] - 2 m [Pi])/Sqrt[3]) - 
 Sum[(-E^(1/2 Sqrt[3] ([Pi] - 2 m [Pi])))^n/n!*
   Assuming[{Element[m, Integers]},

     x -> ([Pi] - 2 m [Pi])/Sqrt[3]]], {n, 1, Infinity}] The remaining work is to find the general $(n-1)$th derivative in the sum and to get rid of the limit in the sum. Here is a contour plot showing the roots of $G(x,3)$.
The orange curve is $\Im(G(x,3))=0$.
The blue curve is $\Re(G(x,3))=0$.
The plot shows $-10<\Re(x)<10,-10<\Im(x)<10$. Also, by comparing the sum and product forms of $G(x,n)$, we can see
$$ \frac{1}{n!}=\sum_{m=1}^\infty\frac{1}{r(n,m)^n}$$","['roots', 'complex-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

Note that $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$ is not necessarily cyclic, so I'm not looking for arguments that use the existence of a primitive root. I'm trying to prove a relation between arithmetic functions and quadratic residues, but I stumbled upon the following problem: if $p$ is a odd prime coprime with $m$, and the order of $p$ is odd, $p$ is a quadratic residue modulo $m$? I have a strong feeling that yes, and that it involves Lagrange's Theorem and the fact that $\frac{\varphi(m)}{|p|}$ is even (Here I use $|p|$ to denote the order of $p$ inside $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$), but somehow I can't bring it all together. Am I missing something?

I already found that any Dirichlet character $G(x)$ defined on $m$ is a eigenvector on this operator and by the multiplicative property $G(p)$ is a eigenvalue. As $m$ is even ($m$ is defined as $4d$ for some integer $d$) I cannot use neither the Legendre or the Jacobi symbol as my eigenvector character, I would need to have at least the Kronecker symbol.

My main reference work is Theory of Rank Tests (Hájek, Šidák and Sen, 1999, 2nd edition) They begin, naturally, by defining the terms and the general framework they will use, as follows: 2.1.1 Probability space and observations From a probabilistic point of view, a random experiment is represented by a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P)$, where $\Omega$ is the space of all possible outcomes of the experiment, $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\sigma$-field determining how finely the outcomes are distinguished, and $P(\cdot)$ is a probability measure. In this setup, observations are defined as $\mathcal{A}$-measurable functions. Until here, I understand perfectly. It is the classical framework. From a statistical point of view, an experiment is described by an indexed set of observations $X=(X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{N})$, each observation $X_{i}$ taking its values $x_{i}$ on the real line or on a proper subset of the real line. The set of observations is determined by its (joint) distribution function
  $$\begin{align}F(x_{1},\dots,x_{N})&=P(X_{1}\le x_{1},\dots,X_{N}\le x_{N}) \tag{1}\\
&-\infty<x_{1},\dots,x_{N}<+\infty
\end{align}$$ Here, I understand that $P$ in $(1)$ is the induced probability measure on $(E^N,\mathcal{E}_{N})$ by $\hat{P}$ where $X_{i}:(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\hat{P})\to(E,\mathcal{E})$ is a $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{E})$-measurable function for all $i=1,\dots,N$ ($\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{E}_{N}$ are appropriate $\sigma$-fields). Is that correct? The book continues with: 2.1.2 Statistics, $\sigma$-fields and $\lambda$-fields A set of observations $X$ together with a distribution function $F(x)$ generates a probability space $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{A},P)$ as follows: $\mathcal{X}$ is the space of all possible values $x=(x_{1},\dots,x_{N})$ of $X$, i.e. it is an N-dimensional Euclidean space; $\mathcal{A}$ is the $\sigma$-field of Borel subsets of $\mathcal{X}$, i.e. the smallest $\sigma$-field containing all events appearing on the right side of $(1)$; finally, $P(\cdot)$ is the probability measure uniquely determined by $(1)$. The set of observations may be considered as an identity map $X(x)=x,\,x\in\mathcal{X}$. [...] As a rule, the probability distribution $P(\cdot)$ will be determined by a density $p$,
  $$P(A)=\int_{A}p(x)\text{d}x\tag{$A\in\mathcal{A}$}$$ This is where I do not fully understand what they mean. They consider $X$ as being defined as follows:
$$X:(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{A},P)\to(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{A},P):x\mapsto X(x)=x$$ And then, while usually $P(X\in A)$ was a notation for $P(X^{-1}(A))$, we have now $P(X^{-1}(A))=P(A)$ since $X$ is the identity. But what motivates such a framework? I mean, why would someone consider $X$ as an identity map. I must admit that I am more used to statistics viewed from a probabilistic point of view (actually, it does not make sense to me to speak about ""probalistic point of view"" and ""statistical point of view""). What does motivate someone to consider the ""observation set"" (whose components are usually considered as a random variables, as far as I know) as an identity map? Why would we need to consider it that way? Why can't we stay in a general ""probabilistic point of view"" with $X_{i}$ being general random variables? I understand it can be a very basic question, but I am quite confused with such a choice in the framework.","['order-statistics', 'statistics', 'probability-distributions']"
1542741,A homological perspective on the Hodge-theorem,"Let $M$ be a smooth oriented manifold of dimension $n$. Let $(\mathcal{A} ^*(M),d)$ be the chain complex of differential forms on $M$. Endowing $M$ with an inner product gives us a hodge star operator which we could use to define the codiferential: $$\delta : \mathcal{A} ^{k}(M) \to \mathcal{A} ^{k-1}(M), \delta: \omega \mapsto (-1)^k \star^{-1}d\star\omega $$ This gives a chain complex $(\mathcal{A} ^*(M),\delta)$. We can now define the laplacian as $\triangle = d \delta + \delta d$. As a chain map, $\triangle : \mathcal{A}^*(M) \to \mathcal{A}^*(M)$ is null homotopic by constrution. By the exterior algebra functor I mean the functor that takes vector bundles over a manifold to their corresponding exterior algebra bundles. 1. Does there exist a map $\varphi: \Gamma(T^*M) \to  \Gamma(T^*M)$ s.t. under the exterior algebra functor the induced map between graded algebras is $\triangle$? To prove the Hodge theorem all we need to do is show that $i: Ker(\triangle) \to \mathcal{A}^*(M)$ is a quasi-isomorphism. From homological algebra we know that the chain map $i$ is a quasi-isomorphism iff its cone $Cone(i)$ is acyclic. 2. What properties should $\varphi: \Gamma (T^*M) \to  \Gamma(T^*M)$ posses to induce a map whose kernel has an acyclic cone? Could the hodge theorem be proved in this way? i.e. by exhibiting some function $\varphi$ satisfying (1) and proving that it posses (2)? (the latter part will no doubt involve some functional anaysis).","['homology-cohomology', 'differential-geometry', 'hodge-theory', 'homological-algebra']"

Let $X,Y$ be fixed CW-complexes. My lecturer defined the $n$-th cellular chain group $C_n ^{\text cell} (X)$ as the free abelian group with generators the $n$-cells of $X$, and the $n$-th boundary map $\partial _n ^{\text cell} $ as the morphism s.t., if $A$ is a $n$-cell of $X$ and $\Phi^{(n)}_A :D^n \to X^n $ is its characteristic map in $X$, we have $ \partial_n ^{\text cell} A = \sum_C \epsilon (A,C) C$, where $C$ ranges over the $n-1$-cells of $Y$ and $\epsilon (A,C)$ is the degree of a map $S^{n-1} \to S^{n-1} $ induced by the characteristic maps of $A$ and $B$ (i.e. he uses the cellular boundary formula as a definition). I know that there is a natural isomorphism between $C_n ^{\text cell}(X) $ and $H_n (X^n ,X^{n-1} )$ (the latter being a singular homology group).

1542879,Geometrization of the positive integers,"I'll explain first how I thought of the problem . I thought that assigning each positive integer a point in the plane and then making some geometrical+number theoretical conditions on them is a cool idea so I made up the problem . Version 1 .
  Is it possible to assign each positive integer $n>1$ a point in the plane $P_n$ (assign different points for different numbers ) and for each positive integer $k>1$ a line $d_k$ such that not all the points are collinear , not all the lines coincide and for each $k>1$ a positive integer the multiple of $k$ points (that is the $P_{nk}$ points with $n$ variable ) are all on the line $d_k$. It seems that this version is straightforward : Take two different lines $d_a$ and $d_b$ so $P_{ab}$ and $P_{2ab}$ are both on $d_a$ and $d_b$ so the lines coincide so this type of construction is not possible . This led me to modify the problem and this is what I made : Version 2 . Assign to each positive integer $n>1$ a point in the plane $P_n$ (assign different points for different numbers ) and for each positive integer $k>1$ a line $d_k$ .Denote by $A_{n,x}$ the number points between $P_n, P_{2n} , \ldots ,P_{xn}$ that lie on the line $d_n$ . For what numbers $c$ with $0 \leq c \leq 1$ there exists such a configuration of points and lines such that not all the points are collinear , not all lines coincide and for all $n>1$ and $x \geq 1$ we have $A_{n,x} \geq cx$ (this is like a density ) . Note that for $c=0$ there clearly is a configuration and for $c=1$ we've shown there aren't any so i think (intuition) there is some $c_0$ such that for $c\leq c_0$ there is a configuration and for $c>c_0$ there isn't . This version may also be straightforward because there are lots of conditions for such a configuration but I haven't managed to find a proof . What I did : Noticed that if $cx>x-1$ that is $x<\frac{1}{1-c}$ we have necessarily $A_{n,x}=x$ for every such $x$ and every $n$ . Then I let $c>\frac{3}{4}$ so $\frac{1}{1-c}>4$ so every $x \leq 4$ has this property . Then through an induction argument I show that the lines $k$ and $k\cdot 2^i \cdot 3^j$ are the same for every $k$ , $i$ and $j$ . I guess this generalizes (though I haven't tried ) :If $c>\frac{n-1}{n}$ and $p_1,\ldots p_l$ are the primes at most $n$ then the lines $k$ and $kp_1^{i_1}\ldots p_l^{i_l}$ coincide for every possible exponents . This is practically equivalent with : If $a \leq n$ then the lines $d_k$ and $d_{ak}$ coincide for every k. Maybe this helps but I haven't figured out how .

In particular, they define the space of locally bounded variation functions $BV_{loc}(U)$ in $U\subset \mathbb R^n$, $U$ open, as the space of functions such that: $f\in L^1_{loc}(U)$; for all open $V\subset \subset U$ we have $\sup\{\int_V f\text{div}
        \phi dx:\phi\in C^1_c(V,\mathbb R^m),|\phi|\leq 1\}=C(V)<+\infty.$ Notation : $V\subset\subset U$ means: $\overline V$ is compact and $\overline{V}\subset U.$ Now, a structure theorem for functions of locally bounded variation holds (Theorem 1 pag. 167). Indeed, if $f\in BV_{loc}(U)$, the linear functional $L\colon\phi\mapsto \int_U f\text{div}\phi dx$ is ""bounded"" in the sense 2. above, so, by Riesz's representation theorem, one gets the existence of a Radon measure $\mu$ on $U$ and a $\mu$-measurable function $\sigma\colon U\to \mathbb R^m$ such that $|\sigma|=1, \mu$-a.e. and $$\int_U f \text{div}\phi dx=-\int_U\phi\cdot \sigma d\mu$$ for all $\phi\in C^1_c(U,\mathbb R^m).$ Now, I know that the measure $\mu$ is given by Riesz's representation theorem itself in the following way: at first, $\mu$ is defined on the open sets $O\subset U$ like this: $$\mu(O)=\sup\{\int_O f\text{div}
        \phi dx:\phi\in C^1_c(O,\mathbb R^m),|\phi|\leq 1\}.$$
Then, on all other subsets $B\subset U$, we put $$\mu(B)=\inf\{\mu(O):B\subset O, \,O \text{ open}\}.$$ What I don't understand is why, at page 170 of the book, there's written that $$\mu(V)=\sup\{\int_V f\text{div} \phi dx:\phi\in C^1_c(V,\mathbb R^m),|\phi|\leq 1\}$$ for all $V\subset \subset U$ , without worrying that $V$ is open or not, but concerning only on the boundedness of $V$.

Then for each convex, compact subset $D$ of $X$, the convex hull of the extremal boundary $\partial D$ of $D$ is dense in $D$. Now I want to apply this result to $X^*$, the dual of a Banach space $X$, equipped with the wk* topology. What I'm interested in is whether or not we can say that the convex hull of $\partial D$ is also norm-dense in $D$? Since the wk* topology is weaker then the norm topology on $X^*$ this is not a given, and I suspect it's generally not true, but I'm curious about this, and don't see a way of proving/disproving it. The book I'm reading (by Pedersen) proves density by taking $x\in D\setminus\overline{\operatorname{convhull}(\partial D)}$. Then since $x$ is part of an open set in a LCS there is an open convex nbd $U$ of $x$ disjoint from $\overline{\operatorname{convhull}(\partial D)}$. Then there is a functional separating $U$ from $\overline{\operatorname{convhull}(\partial D)}$, from which a contradiction is derived. However, there are more open nbds of $x$ in the norm topology then in the wk* topology, so although there cannot be a wk*-open nbd of $x$ in $D\setminus\overline{\operatorname{convhull}(\partial D)}$, there might be such norm-open nbds of $x$. Again, I don't see why denisty in the norm topology should hold (it's not an exercise to prove this; it might very well not be true), but I'm wondering if there is something to be said here.","['locally-convex-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'topological-vector-spaces', 'convex-analysis']"

A minimal counter-example to my claim would be to find a manifold with exactly two Killing vectors $X,Y$ satisfying $[X,Y]\neq 0$, but I seem to be unable to find such a manifold. EDIT: my original claim included further requirements on $Z$, namely that $[Z,X]\neq 0$ and $[Z,Y]\neq 0$. These follow IF we can prove the existence of a linearly independent Killing vector $Z$.
