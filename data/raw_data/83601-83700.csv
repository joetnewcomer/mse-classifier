1092105,Definition of disconnected subsets in metric spaces and in more general settings,"I found the following paragraph in a Real Analysis book (namely, Carother's one). A subset $E$ of a metric space $M$ is disconnected in $E$ if there
  exist disjoint, nonempty, open (in $E$) sets $U$ and $V$ such that $E=
 U \cup V$. Now, it is immediate that this gives us a pair of open sets
  $A$ and $B$ in $M$ such that $U=A \cap E$ and $V = B \cap E$. And so
  ""unrelating"" the relative definition, by writing it in terms of $A$
  and $B$, yields: $A \cap E \neq \varnothing$, $B \cap E \neq
 \varnothing$, $(A \cap E) \cap (B \cap E) = \varnothing$, and $E = (A \cap E) \cup (B \cap E)$, or $E \subset A \cup B$.
  (Phew!) This mess would be greatly simplified if we could take $A$ and
  $B$ to be disjoint in $M$. While this need not hold true in more
  general settings , luck is with us in a metric space. And then Carothers proceeds by giving the following lemma: Let $E$ be a subset of a metric space $M$. If $U$ and $V$ are disjoint
  open sets in $E$, then there are disjoint open sets $A$ and $B$ in $M$
  such that $U = A \cap E$ and $V = B \cap E$. I am wondering, what are the more general settings where this lemma does not hold?","['general-topology', 'connectedness', 'real-analysis']"

1092148,Proof that there is no continuous 1-1 map from the unit circle in $\Bbb R^2$ to $\Bbb R$.,"Let $S^1=\{(x,y) \in \Bbb R^2 : x^2+y^2=1\}$. I'm trying to prove that there is no 1-1 continuous mapping between $S^1$ and the real line. The map is not necessarily onto. Proof so far:
Suppose such a function $f$ existed. Since $S^1$ is compact and $f$ is continuous and 1-1, $f$ inverse exists and is also continuous. Hence the range of $f$ is closed. Not sure where to proceed next.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"
1092154,Why is the convergence absolute?,"There is one thing my book uses in a proof after Abels theorem which I do not understand: Lets say that $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ converges. For $0\le x<1$, we look at $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n$. The book says that this series converges absolutely for all the values of $x$ we have defined it. But why? We started with a sequence that might not even converge absolutely. And how do we know that we even have convergence when we introduce the $x$ variable? It would have been easy to see convergence if the orginal series was absolutely convergent, not only convergent, but they only state that the original series is convergent. UPDATE: If you are interested I got the picture from the book. Theorem 8.2 is Abels theorem, Definition 3.48 is the Cauchy-product(but this is clear from the picture), and what Theorem 3.51 states is also clear from the picture:","['absolute-convergence', 'convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
1092185,Is a normal matrix satisfying $A^TA=...$ circulant?,"Let $A=\{a_{ij}\}$ be a normal matrix such that $a_{ij}\geq 0$ with equality iff $i=j$. Suppose that

A^TA=\begin{pmatrix}
a & b & \cdots & b\\

Does it follow that $A$ is a circulant matrix? Note: There is a partial classification of non-negative normal matrices posted here , which seems like it can be used to attack this problem. There is a geometric interpretation as well: both the set of rows and the set of columns of $A$ form equidistant sets of vectors on a sphere, and basic geometry appears to severely restrict the possibilities.","['geometry', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'diagonalization']"
1092193,Divergence theorem in complex analysis,"I am revisiting my understanding of integration by parts in several complex variables, but I have run into an apparent contradiction.  This shows my understanding is flawed, which is somewhat embarrassing, but I guess I must fess up and humbly ask for clarification here.  I reproduce the problem specified to one complex variable to make it more generally accessible. The differential $1$-form $\mathrm{d}z = \mathrm{d}x+i\mathrm{d}y$ on $\mathbb{C}$ eats a complexified tangent vector $a\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+b\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$, where $a,b \in \mathbb{C}$, and returns the complex number $a+ib$. Let $r : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuously differentiable function.  Assume that $\Omega = \{z \in \mathbb{C} : r(z)<0\}$ is smoothly bounded, and that $\nabla r = \frac{\partial r}{\partial x} \frac{\partial }{\partial x} + \frac{\partial r}{\partial y} \frac{\partial }{\partial y}$ has length $1$ on the boundary of $\Omega$.  Note that here I am thinking of $\nabla r$ as a ""real tangent vector"", but these are canonically included in the complexified tangent bundle as well. Since $\nabla r$ is perpendicular to the boundary of $\Omega$, then by geometry $J(\nabla r) = \frac{\partial r}{\partial x} \frac{\partial }{\partial y} - \frac{\partial r}{\partial y} \frac{\partial }{\partial x}$ must be tangent to the boundary, where $J$ is the complex structure tensor.  This is also of length $1$, so any real tangent vector to the boundary can be written $v = \alpha J(\nabla r)$. Noting that $\mathrm{d}S(v) = \alpha$, it seems that we have point wise equalities $
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{d}z (v) &=  \mathrm{d}z (\alpha J(\nabla r)) \\
&=\alpha \mathrm{d}z \left(\frac{\partial r}{\partial x} \frac{\partial }{\partial y} - \frac{\partial r}{\partial y} \frac{\partial }{\partial x}\right)\\
&=\left( -\frac{\partial r}{\partial y}+i\frac{\partial r}{\partial x}\right) \mathrm{d}S(v)\\
&=2i\cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial r}{\partial x}+i\frac{\partial r}{\partial y}\right)\mathrm{d}S(v)\\
&=2i\frac{\partial r}{\partial \overline{z}} \mathrm{d}S(v)
\end{align*}$ So we can apparently conclude that $\mathrm{d}z = 2i\frac{\partial r}{\partial \overline{z}} \mathrm{d}S$ as $1$-forms on the boundary of $\Omega$ (at least for real tangent vectors which is all we ever plug into either form when integrating something). Unfortunately, this does not pass the following sanity check.  Let $r(z) = |z|^2-1 = z\bar{z}-1$, so that $\Omega$ is the unit disk.  Then, attempting to use the above identity, we obtain $
\begin{align*}
\int_{b\Omega} \frac{1}{z} \mathrm{d}z &= \int_{b\Omega} 2i \frac{1}{z} \frac{\partial r}{\partial \overline{z}} \mathrm{d}S\\
&=2i \int_{b\Omega} \mathrm{d}S\\
&=4\pi i

The usual approach for me would be to say that as $F$ is not dense, there is $h \in \ell^\infty$ orthogonal to $F$, but every initial segment can be approximated by a sequence in $F$ and then try to use a diagonal argument to obtain a contradiction, but I can't make that work.

$$ Its difference quotient $\frac{\Delta\left(f(x)\right)}{\Delta(x)}$ approaches $\cos\frac{\pi}{h}$ as $x$ gets closer to $0$, and thus $f$ is not differentiable in the origin because $\lim\limits_{h\to0}\cos\frac{\pi}{h}$ does not exist. This is the plot of $y=x \cos \frac{\pi}{x}$: But here's how my book goes on: Examining the figure we can foresee that the tangent line in a generic point $P$ of the graph doesn't tend to any limiting position as $P$ tends to the origin along the curve itself. One may think this happens because the graph of the function completes infinitely many oscillations in any neighbourhood of the origin. In fact, no: indeed the function thus defined: $$g(x)=\begin{cases}
x^2\cos\frac{\pi}{x} & \text{for} \ x\ne0 \\ 
0 & \text{for} \ x=0

  has a graph that completes infinitely many oscillations in any neighbourhood of the origin, but, as you can verify, it is differentiable at $x=0$ and we have $g'(0)=0$. This is the plot of $y=x^2 \cos \frac{\pi}{x}$: So, I have two questions related to what I quoted from the book: how do we foresee the non-differentiability of $f$, given that, correctly, the infinitude of the oscillations is not an argument for it? And then, why isn't $f$ differentiable, instead of $g$? I shall emphasise that I know that, simply, the limit as $h\to 0$ of the difference ratio of $f$ doesn't exist, while that of $g$ does, but I've been wondering about an other kind of reason after reading that excerpt.

  $B$ whose course is not known. Given that they have the same speed, prove that chance of them coming within a distance $d$ of each other is always $\frac{2sin^{-1}(\frac{d}{a})}{\pi}$ no matter the course of $A$, provided that it's inclination to $AB$ is not greater than $cos^{-1}(\frac{d}{a})$where $AB=a$ This is a summary of my method so far: First I constructed a vector triangle $ABC$ where $C$ was the intersection of the courses of $A$ and $B$. In this triangle I denoted the angle between $A$ and $AB$ as $\theta$ and $B$ and $AB$ as $\phi$. I then used trigonometry to get an expression for $d$ which I subsequently differentiated with respect to time and set as a minimum so I could get $t=\frac{b+c}{2v}$ where $v$ is the velocity of the ships. Using this I got $d=acos(\frac{\theta + \phi}{2})$ which implies $\phi=2cos^{-1}(\frac{d}{a})-\theta$ Could someone help me proceed and  post a solution themselves if they have a better method?

Math. 97 (1989), no. 1, 53--94, the moduli space $\mathbb M$ of slope-stable holomorphic vector bundles with fixed rank $r$ and fixed determinant line bundle $L$ (such that $\gcd(\deg L,r)=1$) on a smooth, compact, connected Riemann surface $X$ is Fano, which means that the anticanonical line bundle of $\mathbb M$ has positive degree.  By earlier works (I believe), $\mathbb M$ is smooth and compact itself. What can be said about the structure of the moduli space when the degree of $L$ is fixed but the isomorphism class of $L$ is allowed to vary? I suspect it is no longer Fano, for any $r$. Evidence: the $r=1$ version of $\mathbb M$ with $\deg L$ fixed, but with the isomorphism class of $L$ allowed to vary, is the Jacobian of $X$ itself. If the genus of $X$ is $g$, then $\mbox{Jac}(X)$ is a $g$-dimensional complex torus, and hence has trivial anticanonical (and canonical) bundle.  In particular, it is ""Calabi-Yau"" rather than Fano. If we take $\mathbb M$ to be the moduli space of slope-stable holomorphic vector bundles with fixed rank $r>1$ and fixed degree $d$ that are coprime (but not fixed determinant) on a smooth, compact, connected Riemann surface $X$, then is it: (a) Fano (suspect not), (b) Calabi-Yau, or (c) something else? A reference would be helpful, but an intuitive explanation of how going from fixed determinant to non-fixed determinant changes the overall geometry of the moduli space would be great.","['algebraic-geometry', 'holomorphic-bundles', 'complex-geometry']"

1092868,"How prove that $\int_0^\pi {x\,f(\sin x)\,} dx = \frac{\pi }{2}\int_0^\pi {f(\sin x)} \,dx$ [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Evaluate $\int_0^\pi xf(\sin x)dx$ (2 answers) Closed 9 years ago . To prove that $\int_0^\pi  {x\,f(\sin x)\,} dx = \frac{\pi }{2}\int_0^\pi  {f(\sin x)} \,dx$ is true, first I started calculating the integral of the left indefinitely
$$ \int {x\,f(\sin x)\,\,dx}  $$
using substitution:
$$ \sin x = t,\quad  x = \arcsin t, \quad {dx = \frac{{dt}}{{\sqrt {1 - {t^2}} }}}$$
is obtained:
$$ \int {x\,f(\sin x)\,\,dx} = \int {\arcsin t \cdot f(t) \cdot \frac{{dt}}{{\sqrt {1 - {t^2}} }}}$$
$$ \qquad\quad = \int {\frac{{\arcsin t\,dt}}{{\sqrt {1 - {t^2}} }} \cdot f(t)} $$
Then using integration by parts:
$$ \begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
  {u = f(t)},&{dv = \frac{{\arcsin t\,dt}}{{\sqrt {1 - {t^2}} }}} \\ 
  {du = f'(t)\,dt},&{v = \frac{{{{(\arcsin t)}^2}}}{2}} 
\end{array} $$
then:
\begin{align*}
  \int {x\,f(\sin x)\,\,dx}  &= f(t) \cdot \frac{{{{(\arcsin t)}^2}}}{2} - \int {\frac{{{{(\arcsin t)}^2}}}{2}}  \cdot f'(t)\,dt \\ 
   &= f(\sin x) \cdot \frac{{{x^2}}}{2} - \int {\frac{{{x^2}}}{2} \cdot f'(\sin x)\,\cos x\,dx}  \\ 
\end{align*}
Now, evaluating from 0 to $\pi$
\begin{align}
  \int_0^\pi  {x\,f(\sin x)} \,dx & = \left[ {f(t) \cdot \frac{{{x^2}}}{2}} \right]_0^\pi  - \int_0^\pi  {\frac{{{x^2}}}{2} \cdot f'(\sin x)\,\cos x\,dx} \\
  \int_0^\pi  {x\,f(\sin x)} \,dx & = f(0) \cdot \frac{{{\pi ^2}}}{2} - \int_0^\pi  {\frac{{{x^2}}}{2} \cdot f'(\sin x)\,\cos x\,dx} \qquad ..[1] \\ 
\end{align}
On the other hand, doing the same process with the integral on the right side I get:
\begin{equation}\int_0^\pi  {f(\sin x)} \,dx = f(0) \cdot \pi  - \int_0^\pi  {x \cdot f'(\sin x)\,\cos x\,dx}  \qquad ..[2] \end{equation}
And even here I do not have enough data to say that equality $\int_0^\pi  {x\,f(\sin x)\,} dx = \frac{\pi }{2}\int_0^\pi  {f(\sin x)} \,dx$ is true. Can anyone suggest me what to do with the equalities [1] and [2]? Thanks in advance.","['calculus', 'integration', 'real-analysis']"

Suppose that $(X,\mathcal{A})$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B})$ are measurable spaces and $\mathcal{B}$ = $\sigma(\mathcal{G})$ is generated by a family $\mathcal{G}\subset\mathcal{P}(Y)$. Then $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is measurable if and only if $f^{-1}(G)\in \mathcal{A}$ for every $G \in \mathcal{G}$. The proof goes as follows: Set operations are natural under pull-backs, meaning that $f^{-1}(Y\setminus B) = X \setminus f^{-1}(B)$ and $\displaystyle f^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} B_i\right) = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}f^{-1}(B_i)$, $\displaystyle f^{-1}\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty}B_{i}\right) = \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty}f^{-1}(B_{i}).$ It follows that $\mathcal M = \{ B \subset Y : f^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{A}\}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $Y$. By assumption, $\mathcal{M} \supset \mathcal{G}$ and therefore $\mathcal{M} \supset \sigma(\mathcal{G}) = \mathcal{B}$, which implies that $f$ is measurable. Now I got a few questions: 1) How do we know $\mathcal M$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $Y$? 2) ""By assumption, $\mathcal{M} \supset \mathcal{G}$"" - why? $\mathcal M$ is just a sigma algebra on $Y$, one of many, it doesn't have to contain every subset of $Y$, so we don't know if it contains $\mathcal{G}$. 3) Why $\mathcal{M} \supset \sigma(\mathcal{G}) = \mathcal{B}$ implies that $f$ is measurable?

  apply Theorem 2.73 with $K = Y$ to find a point $y \in Y$ that is closest to $h$.
  Let $z := h − y$, so that for any $v \in Y$ and any scalar $t$ we have (noting that the first inequality holds because $(tv+y)\in Y$ and is strict for all $t\ne0$ by the lemma and the second equality holds for the properties of the inner product)

$$\int_0^{\sqrt{\pi }} x \sin \left(x^2\right)dx,$$
for example, most US Calc II students would introduce $u=x^2$ and compute
\begin{align}
  \int x \sin \left(x^2\right)dx &= \frac{1}{2}\int \sin(u) \, du \\
  &= -\frac{1}{2} \cos(u)+c = -\frac{1}{2} \cos(x^2)+c.
\end{align}
Afterward, they would conclude that
$$\int_0^{\sqrt{\pi }} x \sin \left(x^2\right) \, dx = -\frac{1}{2} \cos(x^2) \big|_0^{\sqrt{\pi}} = 1.$$
I would generally encourage them to write
\begin{align}
  \int_0^{\sqrt{\pi }} x \sin \left(x^2\right)dx &= \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\pi} \sin(u) \, du \\
  &= -\frac{1}{2} \cos(u) \big|_0^{\pi} = 1.
\end{align} This question expresses opinion of a typical such student and this answer correctly expresses the fact that the two step process favored my most calculus students is actually more work . I think there's more to it than this, though.  Specifically, the identity
$$\int_a^b f(g(x)) g'(x) \, dx = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u) \, du$$
is a relationship between definite integrals which could have applications other than symbolic evaluation of the integral on the left.  In this case, the change of the bounds of integration is important in its own right.

1093104,Isomorphism of semidirect products [D&F],"I want to solve the following problem from Dummit & Foote's Abstract Algebra text (p. 184 Exercise 6): Assume that $K$ is a cyclic group, $H$ is an arbitrary group and $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ are homomorphisms from $K$ into $\text{Aut}(H)$ such that $\varphi_1(K)$ and $\varphi_2(K)$ are subgroups of $\text{Aut}(H)$. If $K$ is infinite assume $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ are injective. Prove by constructing an explicit isomorphism that $H \rtimes_{\varphi_1} K \cong H \rtimes_{\varphi_2} K$ (in particular, if the subgroups $\varphi_1(K)$ and $\varphi_2(K)$ are equal in $\text{Aut}(H)$, then the resulting semidirect products are isomorphic). [Suppose $\sigma \varphi_1(K) \sigma^{-1}=\varphi_2(K)$ so that for some $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ we have $\sigma \varphi_1(k) \sigma^{-1}=\varphi_2(k)^a$ for all $k \in K$. Show that the map $\psi:H \rtimes_{\varphi_1} K \to H \rtimes_{\varphi_2} K$ defined by $\psi((h,k))=(\sigma(h),k^a)$ is a homomorphism. Show $\psi$ is bijective by constructing a 2-sided inverse.] My attempt: Let $K=\langle x \rangle$, and suppose $\sigma \in \text{Aut}(H)$ conjugates $\varphi_1(K)$ to $\varphi_2(K)$, that is $$\sigma \varphi_1(K) \sigma^{-1}=\varphi_2(K) \tag{1}.$$ From this we find
$$\sigma \varphi_1(x) \sigma^{-1}=\varphi_2(x^a) \tag{2} $$
for some $a \in \mathbb{Z}$. Since all elements of $K$ are powers $x^n$ of $x$, raising this equality to the $n$-th power gives
$$\forall k \in K:\sigma \varphi_1(k) \sigma^{-1}=\varphi_2(k^a)=\varphi_2(k)^a \tag{3}.$$ We now prove that the suggested $\psi$ is a group homomorphism: \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\psi((h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2))&=\psi(h_1 \varphi_1(k_1)(h_2),k_1k_2)=(\sigma(h_1 \varphi_1(k_1)(h_2)),(k_1k_2)^a)\\
&=(\sigma(h_1)(\sigma \varphi_1(k_1))(h_2),k_1^a k_2^a)=(\sigma(h_1)(\varphi_2(k_1^a) \sigma)(h_2),k_1^ak_2^a)\\
&=(\sigma(h_1),k_1^a)(\sigma(h_2),k_2^a)=\psi((h_1,k_1))\psi((h_2,k_2))
\end{split}
\end{equation} Where we have used the fact that $K$ is abelian, alongside with the homomorphism law for $\sigma$ and equation $(3)$. We're left with showing that $\psi$ has a 2-sided inverse, which will be done in two cases: Assume $K=\langle x \rangle$ is infinite cyclic. Property $(3)$ gives 
$$\varphi_2(K)=\varphi_2(K^a) \tag{4}$$
where $K^a$ is the image of $K$ under the $a$-th power homomorphism $K \to K:k \mapsto k^a$. Since $\varphi_2$ is injective, this is only possible if the $a$-th power homomorphism is surjective, which happens iff $a=\pm 1$. We can thus see that
$$\chi((h,k))=(\sigma^{-1}(h),k^a)$$
is a 2-sided inverse of $\psi$. Assume $K=\langle x \rangle \cong Z_n$ is finite cyclic of order $n$, and denote the orders of the cyclic groups $\varphi_1(K),\varphi_2(K)$ by $m$. I believe that $(a,n) = 1$ so that there is some integer $b$ such that $ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$. If we have this, we can see that
$$\chi((h,k))=(\sigma^{-1}(h),k^b) $$
is a 2-sided inverse of $\psi$. However, all I could show is the following. Obviously, $m|n$. Since $\varphi_1(K)=\langle \varphi_1(x) \rangle$ and $\varphi_2(K)=\langle \varphi_2(K) \rangle$ we have $|\varphi_1(x)|=|\varphi_2(x)|$. According to equation (3) $\varphi_2(K)$ is also generated by $\varphi_2(x^a)$, so that $|\varphi_2(x^a)|=|\varphi_2(x)|$ which gives $(a,m)=1$. Raising equation $(2)$ to the power of $|x^a|=\frac{n}{(a,n)}$ gives $1=\varphi_2(1)=\varphi_2((x^{a})^{\frac{n}{(a,n)}})=\varphi_2(x^a)^{\frac{n}{(a,n)}}$, so  that $m| \frac{n}{(a,n)}$. From the first occurrence of ""$a$"" in equation $(2)$, and the fact that $\varphi_2(x^a)=\varphi_2(x)^a$ we can see that $a$ may shifted by any multiple of $m$. My questions: Are there any flaws with my proof? It seems that in the infinite case, it is only necessary to assume one of the $\varphi_i$'s to be injective. Is this true? Is it possible to prove that ""$a$"" can be chosen coprime with $n$? Thank you!","['semidirect-product', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

1093151,“Visualizing” Mathematical Objects - Tips & Tricks,"It has been a while since I am kind of stuck with my skills concerning the visualization of mathematical objects. Here there is the problem. First of all, let me point out that I am completely self-taught. In other words, this actually means that this site is the only possibility I have to speak mathematics, which is a bit like trying to learn japanese by rarely pronouncing some utterance to a random native speaker hoping not to sound too idiotic. In second place, I am trying to move towards rather abstract things, and –from time to time– I do have the feeling I have a decent grasp of what is going on. However… There are some objects that I simply don’t know how to approach! I think the problem can be rephrased in terms of extensive vs. intensive definition of a given mathematical object. I always tend to look for an extensive definition, but –when you start to deal with real analysis, topology or measure theory– those kind of definitions, that quite literally show how an object looks like, simply start to rarify. Thus, when I find a definition of –let’s say– $\ell^p$, or $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$, or Borel Sets, then I really fail to see what is going on. Maybe I can actually manipulate the symbols, and even get a “proof” or something that could almost look like a proof, but still, in most of the cases I have no idea what is going on. [Small aside: this is actually interesting. As long as definitions and objects are sort of trivial, there are ""pictures"" or advice to visualize objects, but when you get to the level of those objects, it is assumed that the reader/learner somewhere has got the skills to visualize those structures.] If you want an analogy, it is a bit like being in a completely dark room, with various objects and the explicit task to make them fit perfectly. I can do it (from time to time), but this does not imply that I see what the single objects where at the beginning, and how they look like now that they are assambled.
Said so, here it comes the questions. How do you actually perceive or visualize the mathematical objects? How did your teachers/professors/supervisors taught you to visualize them? How do you teach your students to visualize mathematical objects? What are the “tricks”? There is something else that should be added, and that I think is related to the fact that I am self-taught. A lot of books of advanced maths simply discard “pictures”, even if (I suppose) maybe the authors were implicitly referring to them when they started to learn the topics. But here there is the point of not -being self taught: there is somebody who gives you this “tricks” (if you don’t like the word, we can use "" upaya "" instead) to build, and then erase every trace of the use of those hints. Thank you for your time and for any feedback that could come! PS: For those who are wondering, I added the real-analysis and measure-theory tags, because I would love to actually see the objects I was referring in the text, and to get tips and hints on how to do it. EDIT: After the nice feedback from user86418, I would like to point out something. The idea behind the question is not to head to the psychology of mathematics , or in other words how each user see things in her/his own mathematical world. Actually, the idea is to look for the general tips that are shown on the whiteboard (quite literally!) to visualize objects.

1093263,Please explain definition of determinant using permutations?,"Many people (in different texts) use the following famous definition of the determinant of a matrix $A$: \begin{align*} \det(A) = \sum_{\tau \in S_n}\operatorname{sgn}(\tau)\,a_{1,\tau(1)}a_{2,\tau(2)} \ldots a_{n,\tau(n)}, \end{align*} where the sum is over all permutations of $n$ elements over the symmetric group. None of them actually explains how one interprets this definition, so this makes me suspicious and think they don't know it either. This is what I understand so far: Definition: A permutation $\tau$ of $n$ elements is a bijective function having the set $ \left\{1, 2, ..., n\right\}$ both as its domain and codomain. The number of permutations of $n$ elements, and hence the cardinality of the set $S_n$ is $n!$ So for example, for every integer $i \in \left\{1, 2, ..., n\right\}$ there exists exactly one integer $j \in \left\{1, 2, ..., n\right\}$ for which $\tau(j) = i$. Permutations can also be represented in matrices, for example if $\tau(1) = 3, \tau(2) = 1, \tau(3) =4, \tau(4) =5, \tau(5) =2$, then \begin{align*} \tau = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 3 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 2 \end{pmatrix}. \end{align*} Definition: Let $\tau \in S_n$ be a permutation. Then an inversion pair $(i,j)$ of $\tau$ is a pair of positive integers $i, j \in \left\{1, 2, ..., n\right\}$ for which $i < j$ but $\tau(i) > \tau(j)$. This determines how many elements are 'out of order'. For example if $\tau = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 3 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$, then $\tau$ has one single inversion pair $(2,3)$, since $\tau(2) = 3 > \tau(3) = 2$. Definition: A transposition , called $t_{ij}$, is the permutation that interchanges $i$ and $j$ while leaving all other integers fixed in place. The numbers of inversions in a transposition is always odd, because one can compute that the number of inversion pairs in $t_{ij}$ is exactly $2(j-1)-1$. Definition: Let $\tau \in S_n$ be a permutation. Then the sign of $\tau$, denoted by sign$(\tau)$ is defined by \begin{align*} sign(\tau) = (-1)^{\text{# of inversion pairs in}\ \tau} \end{align*} This is $+1$ if the number of inversions is even, and $-1$ if the number is odd. Every transposition is an odd permutation. This is all clear to me, but can someone explain to me, in an understandable fashion, how one interprets the definition of the determinant on the basis of all this information? That would be greatly appreciated (not only by me, but I think by many others aswell). For example: what do I make of the $a_{1,\tau(1)}$ etc. in the definition of the determinant, all the way up to $n$? What do they represent?","['permutations', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"

One of the triples $(a, b, c)$ and $(x, y, z)$ has the property that at least two of its members are greater than or equal to $T$ . Assume that $(a, b, c)$ is the one, and choose $\alpha = a - T, \beta = b-T$ and $\gamma = c-T$. We then have $x = T-\alpha, y = T - \beta$ and $z= T - \gamma$. Now the required inequality is equivalent to $$
(T+\alpha)(T-\beta)+(T+\beta)(T-\gamma)+(T+\gamma)(T-\alpha) < 4T^2

-(\alpha \beta + \beta \gamma + \gamma \alpha) <T^2  \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)

Landau's "" da man doch nicht auf diesem elementaren Wege das Ziel erreichen kann...
